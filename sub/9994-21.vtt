00:05.930 --> 00:07.410
Has anyone seen Joe Dubois?

00:10.490 --> 00:11.810
-So you ready for this?

00:11.820 --> 00:13.180
-As ready as i'd ever be.

00:13.230 --> 00:14.740
-Welcome back, Joe
-Thank you

00:15.170 --> 00:19.400
Is everything okay at work?
Is everything okay with us?

00:19.410 --> 00:20.450
Everything is fine.

00:20.500 --> 00:21.590
Something seems wrong.

00:21.630 --> 00:22.590
<i>Mrs. Dubois,</i>

00:22.630 --> 00:24.590
My name is Marcus Canty.

00:24.630 --> 00:25.790
I work with your husband.

00:25.830 --> 00:27.150
Since he's come back to work,

00:27.200 --> 00:28.920
<i>he hasn't been attending any meetings,</i>

00:28.960 --> 00:30.950
<i>he hasn't been making any phone calls.</i>

00:31.000 --> 00:32.420
<i>Your boss called.</i>

00:32.460 --> 00:34.890
They said they might
want you to see someone.

00:34.930 --> 00:36.320
My name is Cooper Conroy.

00:36.360 --> 00:37.490
I'm an attorney,Mr. Dubois.

00:37.530 --> 00:38.720
Can you talk for a moment?

00:38.760 --> 00:40.190
Talk about what?

00:40.230 --> 00:43.620
About millions of dollars I
believe you're entitled to.

00:43.890 --> 00:46.820
<i>I dream the same dream every night,</i>

00:46.860 --> 00:48.990
and there is nothing
circumstantial about it.

00:49.030 --> 00:50.650
We're going to finish trying this case.

00:50.700 --> 00:51.990
We're going to trust the jury.

00:52.030 --> 00:53.320
We find the defendant

00:53.360 --> 00:56.650
guilty of murder in first degree.

00:56.700 --> 00:58.590
Thank you for the encouragement.

00:58.630 --> 01:00.320
I work for the District Attorney,

01:00.360 --> 01:01.650
Manuel Devalos.

01:01.700 --> 01:02.820
It's not that exciting.

01:02.860 --> 01:04.090
Easy for you to say.

01:04.129 --> 01:05.319
You don't sell
pharmaceuticals for a living.

01:05.360 --> 01:06.350
So...

01:06.400 --> 01:08.350
what's it like working for the DA?

01:08.400 --> 01:11.220
I thought you needed
to see this. Oh,my God.

01:11.260 --> 01:15.190
It's Natalie Paxton's head
on Ramona Hensley's body.

01:15.230 --> 01:16.720
<i>City Hall is already being inundated</i>

01:16.760 --> 01:17.950
with people calling for
the immediate release

01:18.000 --> 01:19.690
of Walter Paxton.

01:21.130 --> 01:22.520
You expecting a calltoday... It's okay.

01:22.560 --> 01:24.790
...or maybe a text?

01:24.830 --> 01:27.190
<i>My husband's kind of
going through something.</i>

01:27.230 --> 01:28.690
Well,now we know where the head

01:28.730 --> 01:30.220
of the third victim ended up.

01:30.260 --> 01:31.620
So who's the body belong to?

01:31.660 --> 01:34.190
Driver's license photo.

Hey,Dad.

01:47.140 --> 01:48.320
Evening,son.

01:48.330 --> 01:49.380
<i>So...</i>

01:49.400 --> 01:50.890
what's all the hubbub?

01:50.930 --> 01:52.390
Huh?

01:52.430 --> 01:56.120
What's so important you needed
to raise me from the dead?

01:56.170 --> 01:59.560
Well,I was just kind
of reviewing my options,

01:59.600 --> 02:02.590
contemplating my future.

02:02.630 --> 02:04.220
Well,you know,I don't get you.

02:04.270 --> 02:05.490
I don't know what you're talking about.

02:05.530 --> 02:06.790
What's to contemplate?

02:06.830 --> 02:09.320
I mean,your future's right here.

02:09.370 --> 02:11.090
You got the,the two kids...

02:11.130 --> 02:12.790
Three.

02:12.830 --> 02:16.390
...the happy marriage
to Haley Joel Osment.

02:16.430 --> 02:19.390
Yeah,I know,I know.

02:19.430 --> 02:20.790
I just...

02:20.830 --> 02:24.290
There were five of us in that room,Dad.

02:24.330 --> 02:27.390
Only two of us made it out alive.

02:27.430 --> 02:28.820
Why me?

02:28.870 --> 02:30.020
Why not them?

02:32.070 --> 02:35.920
Because.

02:35.970 --> 02:37.620
That's it?

02:37.670 --> 02:39.160
That's your answer?

02:39.200 --> 02:41.420
"Because"?

02:41.470 --> 02:43.220
You know what your problem is?

02:43.270 --> 02:45.290
You've never been in a war.

02:45.330 --> 02:48.790
My generation... we saw death,

02:48.830 --> 02:51.320
contemplated our own
mortality when we were young

02:51.370 --> 02:52.590
so we didn't have to waste

02:52.630 --> 02:55.020
the rest of our lives worrying about it.

02:55.070 --> 02:57.590
We realized that death
takes care of itself.

02:57.630 --> 03:01.060
It's life that needs your attention.

03:01.100 --> 03:03.520
Life,huh?

03:04.930 --> 03:07.660
Look,you got a great job.
You got a hot little wife.

03:07.700 --> 03:09.990
You got a couple of nice kids,

03:10.030 --> 03:13.690
and here you are
wondering why you're alive.

03:13.730 --> 03:15.120
You know what you need to do?

03:15.170 --> 03:16.290
What's that?

03:16.330 --> 03:18.290
You need to wake up. Oh,really?

03:18.330 --> 03:19.620
I mean it.

03:19.670 --> 03:21.060
Honey,I need you to wake up.

03:21.100 --> 03:22.290
Honey? Darling.

03:22.330 --> 03:24.260
Please,just wake up.

03:24.300 --> 03:25.860
Wait a second. No,I'm confused.

03:25.900 --> 03:26.860
Why should I?

03:28.000 --> 03:30.990
Give me one good reason.

03:31.030 --> 03:34.690
Because I need to talk to
you about a dream I just had.

03:34.730 --> 03:36.920
<i>So they found your friend's body</i>

03:36.970 --> 03:39.590
with the head of the third victim on it?

03:39.630 --> 03:42.220
That would make your
friend the fourth victim.

03:42.270 --> 03:43.420
Uh-huh.

03:44.900 --> 03:47.760
To be honest,I don't think the
issue is as much who to call

03:47.800 --> 03:49.320
as it is what to say.

03:49.370 --> 03:50.560
Well,I have to tell someone.

03:50.600 --> 03:51.920
What are you going to tell them?

03:51.970 --> 03:53.360
"I don't know who the next victim is,

03:53.400 --> 03:55.460
but I can tell you about
the one after that"?

03:55.500 --> 03:57.620
<i>It's not as if you know when
any of this is going to happen.</i>

03:57.670 --> 03:59.260
Are you saying I shouldn't tell anybody?

03:59.300 --> 04:00.660
I don't know.

04:00.700 --> 04:03.790
Keep in mind this is a dream
you had after two martinis.

04:03.830 --> 04:06.390
Uh... I'm not telling you

04:06.430 --> 04:07.520
how to do your job.

04:07.570 --> 04:08.590
I'm just saying that I don't think

04:08.630 --> 04:10.190
there's anyone to call tonight.

04:10.230 --> 04:13.920
Right.

04:13.970 --> 04:16.959
Speaking of calling,how's your phone?

04:17.000 --> 04:19.959
Very clean.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.160
Useless,but very clean.

04:23.230 --> 04:25.390
Melinda had her baby...

04:25.430 --> 04:28.320
and that's who keeps texting me.

04:28.370 --> 04:31.290
She asked about you,by the way.

04:31.330 --> 04:32.860
How you're doing.

04:32.900 --> 04:35.420
How you're doing with me.

04:35.470 --> 04:38.820
Tell her not very well.

04:42.630 --> 04:44.590
But I'm determined to change that.

04:44.630 --> 04:47.760
Yeah.

04:47.800 --> 04:49.890
Me,too.

- Morning.

05:44.580 --> 05:45.700
Dad,where's Mom? Let me switch rooms.

05:45.740 --> 05:47.730
Still sleeping,sweetie.

05:47.780 --> 05:50.030
Can you give her another one?

05:50.080 --> 05:51.570
Okay,let's see.

05:51.610 --> 05:52.570
Here's one.

05:52.610 --> 05:53.600
Jocular.

05:53.640 --> 05:54.930
Hi.

05:54.980 --> 05:57.070
What can I do for you,Mr. Conroy?

05:57.110 --> 05:59.000
At the risk of sounding like a clich?

05:59.040 --> 06:02.000
this call is about
what I can do for you.

06:02.040 --> 06:04.900
I thought we left it that you
were going to wait for my call.

06:04.940 --> 06:07.270
And I would have,but you didn't call.

06:07.310 --> 06:08.670
Usually when I mention

06:08.710 --> 06:10.830
that there's potentially
millions of dollars involved,

06:10.880 --> 06:13.470
people at least let me
buy them a cup of coffee.

06:13.510 --> 06:16.700
You do drink coffee,don't
you,Mr. Dubois?

06:19.780 --> 06:21.870
You were looking for me?

06:21.910 --> 06:24.100
Yeah,I was.

06:24.140 --> 06:26.400
The name P.D. McCall ring a bell?

06:26.440 --> 06:27.730
I'm sorry?

06:27.780 --> 06:28.870
Couple of months ago,

06:28.910 --> 06:30.930
you told me about a
reporter from out of town

06:30.980 --> 06:33.600
who was calling you,asking
questions about this office,

06:33.640 --> 06:36.870
certain particulars about
the Sonny Troyer case.

06:36.910 --> 06:39.430
Do you remember the
name of that reporter?

06:39.480 --> 06:40.970
Not off the top of my head.

06:41.010 --> 06:45.670
I can look it up if it's important.

06:47.080 --> 06:50.000
Amid the flood of articles
from around the country

06:50.040 --> 06:51.770
suggesting that,uh,

06:51.810 --> 06:54.130
I completely misjudged this situation,

06:54.180 --> 06:56.330
did you happen to see this one?

06:56.380 --> 06:58.230
"Aggressive DA's Office

06:58.280 --> 07:00.800
Finally Undone by Recapitator. "

07:00.840 --> 07:01.800
Undone by what?

07:01.840 --> 07:04.200
The Recapitator.

07:04.240 --> 07:06.270
That's what they're calling our killer.

07:06.310 --> 07:08.300
He doesn't just decapitate these women,

07:08.340 --> 07:10.370
he re-capitates them,

07:10.410 --> 07:11.800
putting the head of his last victim

07:11.840 --> 07:13.500
on the body of his current one.

07:13.540 --> 07:15.770
Clever.

07:15.810 --> 07:17.570
Anyway,this P.D. McCall

07:17.610 --> 07:20.230
points out that if I had at
least entertained the deal

07:20.280 --> 07:22.300
that Paxton's attorney was shopping,

07:22.340 --> 07:24.000
that the judge most
certainly would have suspended

07:24.040 --> 07:25.770
the trial prior to the verdict,

07:25.810 --> 07:30.300
and we wouldn't be in
the mess we're in now.

07:30.340 --> 07:32.170
An opinion I know you share.

07:32.210 --> 07:36.200
Manny,I never said
that to anyone but you.

07:36.240 --> 07:38.600
Of course not.

07:38.640 --> 07:40.130
I just can't figure out

07:40.180 --> 07:44.130
<i>why this national reporter
is coming after my scalp.</i>

07:54.980 --> 07:58.000
District Attorney's
Office,Allison Dubois speaking.

07:58.040 --> 08:00.300
Are you that blonde I
saw inhaling martinis

08:00.340 --> 08:02.570
at the hotel bar last night?

08:02.610 --> 08:04.070
Uh,who am I speaking with?

08:04.110 --> 08:06.370
It's your drinking buddy,Drinking Buddy.

08:06.410 --> 08:07.730
How you holding up this morning?

08:07.780 --> 08:09.200
I'm surviving.

08:09.240 --> 08:11.600
My husband let me sleep
in a bit,which was nice.

08:11.640 --> 08:12.830
It's my boss I'm worried about.

08:12.880 --> 08:14.130
Every two minutes,

08:14.180 --> 08:16.130
they bring in another
stack of newspaper articles

08:16.180 --> 08:17.130
about how he bungled

08:17.180 --> 08:19.000
the whole Paxton thing.

08:19.040 --> 08:20.570
He looks so defeated.

08:20.610 --> 08:22.400
Let's change the subject.

08:22.440 --> 08:23.500
What are you doing?

08:23.540 --> 08:25.370
I am killing time
before a client meeting.

08:25.410 --> 08:27.070
Why? You want to get another drink?

08:27.110 --> 08:29.000
Yes,but I can't.

08:29.040 --> 08:30.030
Actually,I'm glad you called.

08:30.080 --> 08:31.930
I wanted to ask you a question.

08:31.980 --> 08:33.000
Oh,excellent.

08:33.039 --> 08:34.630
You ask the questions for a change.

08:34.679 --> 08:36.570
How long are you going to be in town?

08:36.610 --> 08:37.770
Why? Hubby jealous?

08:37.809 --> 08:38.770
No,I'm serious.

08:38.809 --> 08:40.470
Last night when I left,

08:40.510 --> 08:44.600
I thought about you in
that hotel by yourself.

08:44.640 --> 08:47.700
I kind of like the way you look
with your head on your own neck.

08:48.880 --> 08:51.970
You are really sweet
in a deeply twisted way.

08:52.010 --> 08:54.030
I am here for as long as it takes me

08:54.080 --> 08:56.230
to get my work done,but
don't be concerned.

08:56.280 --> 08:58.170
There's thousands of
hotel rooms in Phoenix

08:58.210 --> 08:59.530
and only one Recapitator.

08:59.580 --> 09:00.970
Recapitator?

09:01.010 --> 09:03.670
Oh,my God,I just heard someone
call him that in the elevator.

09:03.710 --> 09:05.270
I can't believe a civilian like you

09:05.310 --> 09:07.030
is already acting like that's his name.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.100
<i>That is his name and I like it.</i>

09:09.140 --> 09:10.930
I told you
- Court TV junkie.

09:10.980 --> 09:12.570
So... give me some dirt.

09:12.610 --> 09:14.200
What are the police
saying about the connection

09:14.240 --> 09:16.270
between Paxton's wife
and this new victim?

09:16.310 --> 09:17.600
Well,that's what's scary.

09:17.640 --> 09:19.900
There doesn't seem to be a
connection other than the fact

09:19.940 --> 09:23.500
that they were both alone
in expensive hotel rooms.

09:23.540 --> 09:25.500
It seems completely random,

09:25.540 --> 09:28.730
which is why,as much as
I enjoy having you around,

09:28.780 --> 09:30.430
I sure would feel much better

09:30.480 --> 09:33.500
if you left town until
we catch this guy.

09:33.540 --> 09:35.870
Or- I don't know-
come stay at my house.

09:35.910 --> 09:38.600
You can be the referee
between me and my husband.

09:38.640 --> 09:41.870
Sorry,I like my job
and I like room service,

09:41.910 --> 09:44.770
but I'd love to do the cocktail
or the lunch thing again.

09:44.810 --> 09:46.030
Anyway,you know what?

09:46.080 --> 09:47.300
I got to go.

09:47.340 --> 09:49.800
For crying out loud,you
work for politicians,girl.

09:49.840 --> 09:52.670
Stop worrying about my neck
and watch out for your own.

09:52.710 --> 09:54.100
<i>Sorry to keep you waiting.</i>

09:54.140 --> 09:56.270
I had a doctor's appointment.

09:56.310 --> 09:58.700
Company-ordered therapy.

09:58.740 --> 10:01.330
Eh,it's pretty standard
in situations like this.

10:02.410 --> 10:04.700
Forgive me; situations like what?

10:04.740 --> 10:06.900
I think what I've been
through is fairly unique.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.930
I didn't mean to diminish
the impact it's had

10:08.980 --> 10:10.700
on you or,or your life.

10:10.740 --> 10:12.170
That's the reason I'm here.

10:12.210 --> 10:14.930
I've actually had quite a bit
of experience in this area.

10:14.980 --> 10:16.970
And what is "this area"?

10:17.010 --> 10:20.570
Suing the companies where
the,where the violence occurs?

10:20.610 --> 10:22.100
Aren't they victims in all this,too?

10:22.140 --> 10:24.700
I mean,they didn't tell my co-worker

10:24.740 --> 10:25.930
to bring a gun to work,

10:25.980 --> 10:28.800
much less use it against his colleagues.

10:28.840 --> 10:31.500
And if you really want
to start assigning blame,

10:31.540 --> 10:33.330
he wasn't even an employee.

10:33.380 --> 10:34.900
He was fired.

10:34.940 --> 10:37.330
He used my ID to get in the front gate.

10:37.380 --> 10:38.770
I gave it to him.

10:38.810 --> 10:40.070
If you wanted to,

10:40.110 --> 10:43.830
you could argue that the
whole thing was my fault.

10:43.880 --> 10:46.800
Guy brings a gun to work,kills
himself and two others.

10:46.840 --> 10:47.800
My fault.

10:47.840 --> 10:48.970
Three guns.

10:49.010 --> 10:50.670
Excuse me?

10:50.710 --> 10:52.970
<i>He came to the office with three guns.</i>

10:53.010 --> 10:55.170
Right.

10:55.210 --> 10:57.630
Aerodytech is a government contractor.

10:57.680 --> 10:59.970
The sensitive nature of their work means

11:00.010 --> 11:02.500
that they're a target for terrorists,

11:02.540 --> 11:04.900
disgruntled employees,and competitors.

11:04.940 --> 11:07.370
And you're telling me you think
it's okay that the only thing

11:07.410 --> 11:11.700
standing between Aerodytech
and Bruce Rossiter's guns

11:11.740 --> 11:14.370
was your ID at an
unmanned security gate?

11:14.410 --> 11:17.370
Mr. Dubois,these people

11:17.410 --> 11:20.230
did not take adequate precautions

11:20.280 --> 11:24.000
to protect the country,its
secrets,or their employees.

11:24.040 --> 11:26.100
Stop working so hard to defend them.

11:26.140 --> 11:28.130
They certainly didn't
do much to defend you.

11:32.880 --> 11:35.500
It's me,the hunter-gatherer.

11:35.540 --> 11:37.330
I bring food

11:37.380 --> 11:40.300
and communications
from the outside world.

11:40.340 --> 11:42.000
In here.

11:42.040 --> 11:46.200
Daddy's home.

11:46.240 --> 11:49.300
Can I steal you for a minute?

11:49.340 --> 11:52.530
Bridge,would you finish
setting the table for Mommy?

11:52.580 --> 11:54.400
I can't decide if this guy's our savior

11:54.440 --> 11:56.870
or Mephistopheles in lawyer's clothing.

11:56.910 --> 11:58.770
There's something about his intensity.

11:58.810 --> 12:01.100
On the one hand,I love the fact

12:01.140 --> 12:02.470
that he might be working for us,

12:02.510 --> 12:04.030
and on the other hand,I
feel ashamed of myself

12:04.080 --> 12:07.270
for hiring somebody like
that to do our bidding.

12:09.080 --> 12:11.170
Why are you smiling? What
are you smiling about?

12:12.610 --> 12:14.900
You're talking to me. I miss that.

12:19.110 --> 12:22.230
I honestly just don't know what to do.

12:22.280 --> 12:24.930
I like Aerodytech.

12:24.980 --> 12:27.430
And it just seems wrong when I...

12:27.480 --> 12:29.500
when I think about my dead friends,

12:29.540 --> 12:31.100
and I think about that awful day,

12:31.140 --> 12:33.830
to be thinking about money.

12:35.310 --> 12:37.600
Maybe that's naive.

12:37.640 --> 12:39.700
I mean,what would I say to Mr. Canty?

12:39.740 --> 12:41.600
Oh,my God,he called you.

12:41.640 --> 12:43.300
Left you a message on
the answering machine.

12:43.340 --> 12:45.430
I didn't get a chance to tell you.

12:45.480 --> 12:47.330
He wants to have lunch
with you tomorrow.

12:47.380 --> 12:50.370
See,I already feel like I'm cheating
on him by having this conversation.

12:52.080 --> 12:54.400
He said "millions of dollars. "

12:54.440 --> 12:58.030
Maybe "tens of millions of dollars. "

12:58.080 --> 13:02.370
All right,ladies and
gentlemen,five women are dead now,

13:02.410 --> 13:06.730
all brutally murdered
by the same sociopath.

13:06.780 --> 13:08.970
Are you embarrassed?

13:09.010 --> 13:10.870
Are you ashamed?

13:10.910 --> 13:13.600
I know I am.

13:13.640 --> 13:18.230
Our local hotels and restaurants
are losing millions in revenue.

13:18.280 --> 13:20.130
Our convention center is empty.

13:20.180 --> 13:22.730
Every day brings a new cancellation.

13:22.780 --> 13:25.000
And our Chamber of
Commerce is telling me

13:25.040 --> 13:28.230
that it will take years
to shake off the perception

13:28.310 --> 13:30.770
of Phoenix as an unsafe city to visit.

13:33.780 --> 13:36.070
Well,I won'have it.

13:36.110 --> 13:38.100
Not on my watch.

13:41.920 --> 13:45.240
I'm not going down like my predecessor.

13:46.320 --> 13:50.060
I like being the new DA of Phoenix.

13:50.930 --> 13:52.660
Huh?

14:02.260 --> 14:04.900
There's another murder after Debra's.

14:04.910 --> 14:06.250
Huh?

14:06.260 --> 14:09.380
I said,"There's another
murder after Debra's. "

14:10.640 --> 14:13.110
I'm sorry. I know that
you said something to me

14:13.120 --> 14:14.640
'cause I saw your mouth was moving.

14:14.680 --> 14:16.270
It was awful.

14:16.280 --> 14:18.280
Five women killed.

14:18.290 --> 14:19.570
Debra and then another one,

14:19.580 --> 14:21.460
and Devalos wasn't the DA anymore.

14:21.470 --> 14:22.690
They got rid of him.

14:22.740 --> 14:24.930
Okay,okay.

14:24.970 --> 14:26.630
So this is in the future?

14:26.670 --> 14:29.660
Yeah. But you don't
know specifically when?

14:29.700 --> 14:31.660
What can I do that I
haven't already done?

14:31.700 --> 14:34.910
I tried to convince
Debra she was in danger.

14:34.920 --> 14:36.540
She wouldn't believe me.

14:36.550 --> 14:38.530
What am I going to do? Tell my boss,

14:38.540 --> 14:40.210
"Hey,now might be a great time

14:40.220 --> 14:42.320
"for you to get that resume out there.

14:42.330 --> 14:44.860
Check out the DA wanted ads"?

14:45.870 --> 14:47.530
What,laughing,sleepy boy?

14:47.570 --> 14:49.390
You going to make some more fun of me?

14:49.440 --> 14:51.160
No,I'm not making fun of you.

14:51.200 --> 14:54.460
I just seems to me like
this is just a math problem.

14:54.500 --> 14:56.860
What's a math problem?

14:56.900 --> 14:59.390
You said there are five victims

14:59.440 --> 15:02.390
and that your friend
is the fourth victim.

15:02.440 --> 15:04.960
And you implied that Devalos gets fired

15:05.000 --> 15:07.260
after the death of the fifth girl.

15:07.300 --> 15:10.230
So it just seems pretty obvious
to me what you've got to do.

15:10.270 --> 15:12.730
Okay.

15:12.770 --> 15:15.260
Well,just don't let
your friend get murdered.

15:15.300 --> 15:16.830
Then your friend lives;

15:16.870 --> 15:19.260
Devalos doesn't get fired;

15:19.300 --> 15:20.930
there is no fifth victim;

15:20.970 --> 15:23.790
everyone lives happily...

15:23.840 --> 15:27.230
well,I suppose the third
victim is not that happy,but...

15:27.270 --> 15:29.730
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

15:29.770 --> 15:31.890
All right,I'm not making myself clear.

15:33.870 --> 15:36.090
Okay,if your friend
is the fourth victim,

15:36.140 --> 15:37.930
then just don't let her be.

15:37.970 --> 15:39.290
Put her under surveillance.

15:39.340 --> 15:40.890
Don't let her out of your sight.

15:40.940 --> 15:43.790
You know this guy is going
to come and look for her,

15:43.840 --> 15:45.230
so just be there when he does.

15:45.270 --> 15:47.690
Stop the murder,stop the murderer.

15:51.240 --> 15:53.530
I need you to do something for me.

15:56.570 --> 15:58.530
Joe? Hey,Marcus.

15:58.570 --> 16:00.260
How are you? Texting my wife.

16:00.300 --> 16:02.190
New phone,does everything
but make coffee.

16:02.240 --> 16:04.230
That's nice.

16:05.570 --> 16:08.090
You're looking good. Relaxed.

16:08.140 --> 16:10.690
I talked to Dr. Myers.

16:10.740 --> 16:12.890
He's very pleased about everything.

16:14.440 --> 16:17.430
Joe,we miss you.

16:17.470 --> 16:18.830
Hey,I miss being there.

16:18.870 --> 16:21.060
I don't know what happened
that week I came back...

16:21.100 --> 16:23.530
Doesn't matter. Myers
says you're better.

16:23.570 --> 16:25.330
So if you're willing,

16:25.370 --> 16:27.790
you and your,uh,new phone...

16:27.840 --> 16:30.360
More than willing.

16:30.400 --> 16:33.090
Um...

16:33.140 --> 16:34.790
What's this?

16:34.840 --> 16:36.590
It's your annual bonus check.

16:36.640 --> 16:38.960
Postdated,you won't be able

16:39.000 --> 16:42.660
to cash it for a few weeks,but
we wanted you to have it.

16:42.700 --> 16:44.630
So you know what we were thinking.

16:44.670 --> 16:46.990
It's a little
premature,isn't it? It's May.

16:47.040 --> 16:49.290
Well,given everything that's happened...

16:52.470 --> 16:54.530
I know.

16:54.570 --> 16:57.130
It's probably four times
what you were expecting.

16:57.170 --> 16:58.730
Closer to five.

16:58.770 --> 17:01.530
You know,I can hear you're in a hurry

17:01.570 --> 17:03.690
to get back to work,but the truth is,

17:03.740 --> 17:05.890
if you wanted a couple more weeks-

17:05.940 --> 17:08.359
no doctors,no anything-

17:08.400 --> 17:10.190
just a real vacation,

17:10.240 --> 17:11.990
we would certainly understand.

17:15.640 --> 17:18.260
Everything all right?

17:18.300 --> 17:19.730
I won't lie to you.

17:19.770 --> 17:23.089
You go through an
experience like this...

17:24.940 --> 17:28.730
...and you start looking
at all your options.

17:28.770 --> 17:30.960
Looking back on your
whole professional life

17:31.000 --> 17:34.230
wondering if it was
really as meaningful...

17:34.270 --> 17:37.830
as you remember it being.

17:37.870 --> 17:40.660
Wondering if the people that
you've given your life to...

17:42.040 --> 17:45.830
...well,if any of it
actually matters to them.

17:45.870 --> 17:48.330
Well,I hope you can see that it did...

17:48.370 --> 17:50.030
that it does.

17:50.070 --> 17:52.530
You just need to take your time.

17:52.570 --> 17:53.960
Make sure you're ready.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.330
Then come back and we'll
hit the ground running.

17:58.570 --> 18:00.230
Thank you.

18:01.740 --> 18:04.930
To the future.

18:08.370 --> 18:10.230
Oh,actually,

18:10.270 --> 18:13.030
there is one little
thing I need you to do

18:13.070 --> 18:14.660
sooner rather than later.

18:16.570 --> 18:18.690
Just over the weekend,take it home,

18:18.740 --> 18:21.830
and when you get a chance,uh,read
it over and then sign it.

18:21.870 --> 18:23.490
I'm sorry,Marcus. What is this?

18:23.540 --> 18:26.930
Oh,it's just a standard form.

18:26.970 --> 18:29.560
The insurance company
wanted us to give it to you.

18:29.600 --> 18:31.690
It's,uh,some kind

18:31.740 --> 18:33.560
of liability waiver.

18:33.600 --> 18:36.490
"I,Joseph Dubois,hereby
release Aerodytech,

18:36.540 --> 18:38.490
"its officers and
shareholders from any claim,

18:38.540 --> 18:40.060
"future or past,relating to events

18:40.100 --> 18:43.230
occurring on or off
company property... "

18:45.700 --> 18:48.160
You mind if I have an
attorney take a look at this?

18:48.200 --> 18:49.860
Of course not.

18:49.900 --> 18:52.060
It's a little awkward,but,uh...

18:52.100 --> 18:55.860
I need to have that back
before you can return to work.

18:55.900 --> 18:57.490
Excuse me?

18:57.540 --> 19:00.030
It's not us. It's the insurance company.

19:00.070 --> 19:02.290
They're insisting we get
your signature on those

19:02.340 --> 19:04.190
before we can bring you back.

19:04.240 --> 19:05.960
You understand.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.030
Marcus,are you saying
that if I don't sign these,

19:08.070 --> 19:09.260
I can't come back to work?

19:09.300 --> 19:10.890
No,I'm not saying that.

19:10.940 --> 19:12.390
They can't do that.

19:12.440 --> 19:14.190
Aerodytech can't do that.

19:14.240 --> 19:16.360
You can't fire someone without cause.

19:16.400 --> 19:19.190
Joe,please don't go down this road.

19:19.240 --> 19:21.930
There's always cause.
They'll find cause.

19:21.970 --> 19:23.960
No! There is no cause.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.760
What did I do?

19:27.070 --> 19:29.860
I sat there for eight hours

19:29.900 --> 19:32.260
with a gun pointed at me

19:32.300 --> 19:34.730
and tried to reason with a man.

19:34.770 --> 19:37.060
That's cause?! That's not cause.

19:37.100 --> 19:38.660
How about not showing up

19:38.700 --> 19:41.460
for your company-mandated
therapy last week?

19:41.500 --> 19:44.090
The insurance company
seems to think that's cause.

19:46.300 --> 19:47.260
Wait a minute. Where are you going?

19:47.300 --> 19:48.560
We haven't even ordered yet.

19:48.600 --> 19:49.560
I'm not hungry.

19:49.600 --> 19:51.560
I want you to think about this.

19:51.600 --> 19:53.760
There's a lot of money in that envelope.

19:53.800 --> 19:56.960
And who knows,maybe I
could get you a little more.

19:57.700 --> 19:59.390
You...

19:59.440 --> 20:01.160
<i>I'm telling you,I didn't
know what to think.</i>

20:01.200 --> 20:03.490
It felt like an ultimatum.

20:03.540 --> 20:05.160
I came this close to calling that lawyer

20:05.200 --> 20:06.930
and saying,"Let's go. "

20:08.300 --> 20:10.430
Well,maybe Mr. Canty was being honest.

20:10.470 --> 20:11.830
I'm sure their insurance company

20:11.870 --> 20:13.930
is terrified that you're going to sue.

20:13.970 --> 20:16.190
I'm sure they do want
them to get you to sign

20:16.240 --> 20:18.460
some kind of waiver or something.

20:18.500 --> 20:21.260
The good news is they're not
dropping you like a hot potato.

20:21.300 --> 20:25.430
They're throwing money
at you to get you to stay.

20:25.470 --> 20:28.090
They just don't want you to
turn around a year from now

20:28.140 --> 20:29.760
and drag them into court.

20:29.800 --> 20:31.590
Well,it's not like
they're throwing millions,

20:31.640 --> 20:34.590
certainly not tens of millions.

20:34.640 --> 20:36.530
I don't know. Of course there's

20:36.570 --> 20:39.190
no guarantee that if I do sue...

20:40.940 --> 20:42.890
Do me a favor. Dream about us tonight.

20:42.940 --> 20:44.560
Tell me what I should do.

20:44.600 --> 20:46.030
Well,that's not fair.

20:46.070 --> 20:48.390
If I tell you what to do,who's
going to tell me what to do?

20:48.440 --> 20:50.290
What are you talking about?
You don't need advice.

20:50.340 --> 20:52.460
You know everything before
it happens. Not true.

20:52.500 --> 20:54.460
That little piece of advice
you gave me this morning?

20:54.500 --> 20:56.860
Yeah,that worked out for you?

20:56.900 --> 20:58.860
I went right to Scanlon,told
him he had to put Debra

20:58.900 --> 21:00.630
under 24-hour surveillance.

21:00.670 --> 21:02.660
That's my girl.

21:07.070 --> 21:09.630
And I told him about some filthy,

21:09.670 --> 21:12.430
dirty text messages I got this morning.

21:12.470 --> 21:14.890
I'd like to have him
investigate to put a stop to it.

21:14.940 --> 21:17.290
Oh,really? You want those to stop,huh?

21:22.300 --> 21:23.990
Someone is feeling better.

21:24.040 --> 21:25.290
What can I tell you?

21:25.340 --> 21:27.290
It's a triumph of the human spirit.

21:34.640 --> 21:36.190
Sorry,ma'am.

21:36.240 --> 21:38.730
I didn't realize you were
here. I'll come back later.

21:42.400 --> 21:44.390
Ma'am,are you okay?

21:48.270 --> 21:50.530
Ma'am?

22:02.490 --> 22:04.720
A maid found her in the hotel bathtub.

22:05.540 --> 22:08.000
And we're sure it's this... Recapitator.

22:08.010 --> 22:09.140
Not some copycat?

22:09.180 --> 22:11.940
The previous victim's
head was there as well.

22:11.980 --> 22:15.100
I got here as quickly as I could.

22:15.150 --> 22:16.770
You okay?

22:16.810 --> 22:18.070
I'd rather be at the scene.

22:18.110 --> 22:19.500
I'd rather not be looking at pictures.

22:19.550 --> 22:21.770
But when the mayor asks
you to sit this one out...

22:21.810 --> 22:23.900
When the governor asks
you to sit this one out...

22:23.950 --> 22:25.900
Press is getting pretty vicious.

22:25.950 --> 22:27.240
Care to see the carnage?

22:27.280 --> 22:28.340
That's okay.

22:28.380 --> 22:29.400
I've seen it.

22:29.450 --> 22:30.500
So,who was she?

22:30.550 --> 22:32.740
Cheryl Ann Potts,24 years old.

22:32.780 --> 22:34.140
In town for her sister's wedding.

22:35.810 --> 22:37.100
This is what she looked like

22:37.150 --> 22:38.840
when she was still in one piece.

22:41.980 --> 22:44.740
This is the girl I was telling
you about yesterday,Lee.

22:44.780 --> 22:46.300
Red hair. Pretty.

22:46.350 --> 22:48.370
It was her head that
ends up on Debra's body.

22:48.410 --> 22:49.670
We can't allow it to happen.

22:49.710 --> 22:50.800
Wait a second.

22:50.850 --> 22:52.700
What are you talking about?

22:52.750 --> 22:54.100
We knew about this girl?

22:54.150 --> 22:55.270
And who's this Debra?

22:55.310 --> 22:57.270
Debra's a friend of mine.

22:57.310 --> 23:00.470
I had a dream that she was
going to be the fourth victim.

23:00.510 --> 23:02.800
I had no idea who the third
victim was going to be,

23:02.850 --> 23:04.000
other than

23:04.050 --> 23:05.540
what her head looked
like on Debra's body.

23:05.580 --> 23:06.840
And...?

23:06.880 --> 23:08.940
And I've been doing some
pretty fancy footwork

23:08.980 --> 23:10.200
and we've had Debra under surveillance

23:10.250 --> 23:11.570
since yesterday afternoon.

23:11.610 --> 23:13.570
Of course,nobody knows
why they're watching her,

23:13.610 --> 23:16.140
and she has no idea
that she's being watched.

23:16.180 --> 23:17.600
Well,that may have to change.

23:17.650 --> 23:19.300
I can't sit by and just let
this woman go about her business

23:19.350 --> 23:20.540
when we have reason to believe

23:20.580 --> 23:22.040
that she could be the next victim.

23:22.080 --> 23:25.040
It's not as if our people are
in the hotel room with her.

23:27.010 --> 23:28.970
We have to be smart about it,though,

23:29.010 --> 23:31.840
given the way we came
into this information.

23:31.880 --> 23:35.040
I can't go to her,and
neither can you,Lee.

23:35.080 --> 23:36.670
It has to come from you,Allison,

23:36.710 --> 23:38.170
as a friend.

23:38.210 --> 23:41.000
Explain to her that you've
been working on this case.

23:41.050 --> 23:42.200
You've just become privy

23:42.250 --> 23:44.770
to some highly classified
information and...

23:44.810 --> 23:47.100
you believe she may be a target.

23:47.150 --> 23:49.840
See if you can get her
to leave town for a while,

23:49.880 --> 23:50.940
stay with friends...

23:50.980 --> 23:52.070
I tried that.

23:52.110 --> 23:53.800
Well,try again. Try harder.

23:53.850 --> 23:56.800
It's not often in life that we
get a chance to thwart disaster.

23:56.850 --> 23:58.400
Let's not have to look back

23:58.450 --> 24:00.740
and regret what we could have done.

24:03.450 --> 24:05.500
Hey!

24:06.610 --> 24:07.740
Wow.

24:07.780 --> 24:09.240
You really are persistent.

24:09.280 --> 24:11.100
First I get a cell
phone full of messages

24:11.150 --> 24:12.340
and then you show up here.

24:12.380 --> 24:13.970
Allison,I really would
have called you back.

24:15.950 --> 24:18.070
Is something the matter?

24:18.110 --> 24:19.740
Okay,you know what?

24:19.780 --> 24:21.800
I'm gonna change my clothes
and I'll meet you downstairs

24:21.850 --> 24:23.040
in the bar in ten minutes.

24:23.080 --> 24:24.440
No,the bar won't work.

24:24.480 --> 24:25.600
Are you alone?

24:25.650 --> 24:27.170
Um...

24:27.210 --> 24:29.340
Yeah,I'm alone,but I'm also a pig.

24:29.380 --> 24:31.700
My... my room's a nightmare
even after housekeeping,so.

24:31.750 --> 24:33.940
Oh,it doesn't matter.

24:33.980 --> 24:35.340
Okay.

24:35.380 --> 24:36.700
Sorry,yeah,come in.

24:38.750 --> 24:41.900
REPORTER ... winds,expect
a high near 52 degrees.

24:41.950 --> 24:44.100
Clear tonight,with a low near 41.

24:44.150 --> 24:47.440
This just in: the body
of Cheryl Ann Potts,

24:47.480 --> 24:48.970
found beheaded in her hotel room

24:49.010 --> 24:50.740
earlier today...

24:50.780 --> 24:52.740
Sit.

24:59.650 --> 25:01.640
It... Sit.

25:04.880 --> 25:06.040
Sorry.

25:06.080 --> 25:07.540
I'm expecting a call.

25:07.580 --> 25:08.640
Mmm.

25:08.680 --> 25:09.970
Can I get you a drink?

25:10.010 --> 25:11.300
Mini-drink from
my mini-bar?

25:11.350 --> 25:14.270
I'm terrified for you.

25:14.310 --> 25:16.740
Okay.

25:16.780 --> 25:18.270
You know what,Allison?

25:18.310 --> 25:19.840
This has got to stop.

25:19.880 --> 25:22.700
You... are watching
way too much television,

25:22.750 --> 25:25.640
reading way too many newspapers.

25:25.680 --> 25:28.200
Do you know how many hotel
rooms there are in Phoenix?

25:28.250 --> 25:29.740
I do.

25:29.780 --> 25:31.000
I researched it

25:31.050 --> 25:32.900
after the last time you brought this up.

25:32.950 --> 25:37.800
Depending on how you count,over 55,000.

25:37.850 --> 25:39.670
I feel totally safe.

25:39.710 --> 25:40.900
Well,you're not.

25:40.950 --> 25:42.070
Not in this hotel.

25:42.110 --> 25:43.240
Not in that bed.

25:43.280 --> 25:46.240
Okay.

25:46.280 --> 25:48.270
I need a drink.

25:50.280 --> 25:52.240
Debra,this is what I do all day:

25:52.280 --> 25:53.500
work on this case;

25:53.550 --> 25:56.370
sift through information;
meet with detectives.

25:56.410 --> 25:57.940
And today...

25:57.980 --> 26:00.340
I can't tell you very much,but...

26:00.380 --> 26:03.340
I was given some
information,some intelligence.

26:03.380 --> 26:05.000
You're his next target.

26:05.050 --> 26:06.170
You.

26:06.210 --> 26:07.800
Really?

26:07.850 --> 26:09.140
Me?

26:09.180 --> 26:10.500
Why?

26:10.550 --> 26:12.370
You,you think he's looking
for free drug samples?

26:12.410 --> 26:14.100
This isn't funny.

26:14.150 --> 26:17.100
I'm not laughing.

26:18.150 --> 26:21.100
You see this?

26:21.150 --> 26:23.440
This is how I live most of the time:

26:23.480 --> 26:24.770
out of a suitcase,

26:24.810 --> 26:26.900
from one strange hotel room to another.

26:26.950 --> 26:29.570
And you come along and you say

26:29.610 --> 26:31.570
"Debra,I need you to pay attention.

26:31.610 --> 26:33.570
I need you to get good and scared. "

26:33.610 --> 26:36.240
And you don't understand.

26:36.280 --> 26:39.840
You're telling a pilot
that flying isn't safe.

26:39.880 --> 26:41.170
You're telling a heart surgeon

26:41.210 --> 26:44.170
that it's unhealthy
to handle human blood.

26:44.210 --> 26:45.670
This is my life.

26:45.710 --> 26:47.270
This is how I make my living.

26:47.310 --> 26:49.740
So you're going to have
to tell me something more

26:49.780 --> 26:50.940
than just "you're next. "

26:50.980 --> 26:53.370
I mean,how can you be so sure?

26:53.410 --> 26:54.370
Did you guys get a list?

26:54.410 --> 26:55.800
Do,do I have something in common

26:55.850 --> 26:57.040
with the other women who died?

26:57.080 --> 26:58.200
I told you.

26:58.250 --> 27:00.200
I can't tell you how
I got my information

27:00.250 --> 27:02.800
or even the nature of my information.

27:02.850 --> 27:06.340
Just that I believe it
to be extremely accurate.

27:06.380 --> 27:07.740
No offense,Allison,

27:07.780 --> 27:09.740
but if this information is so accurate,

27:09.780 --> 27:12.670
then why did they send you to tell me?

27:12.710 --> 27:14.170
Where's the District Attorney?

27:14.210 --> 27:16.170
Where's the Chief of Police?

27:16.210 --> 27:19.140
I mean,if I called your boss
right now,would he back you up?

27:19.180 --> 27:20.500
I don't know.

27:20.550 --> 27:22.500
I don't know if he could.

27:22.550 --> 27:25.300
No,with everything that's going on,

27:25.350 --> 27:27.640
you shouldn't call him.

27:27.680 --> 27:30.940
Okay,well,you've certainly
given me a lot to think about.

27:32.010 --> 27:35.540
I swear on my children's lives

27:35.580 --> 27:38.200
what I am telling you is true.

27:38.250 --> 27:41.100
Okay.

27:41.150 --> 27:43.170
Will you call me?

27:43.210 --> 27:45.170
Will you tell me what you decide?

27:45.210 --> 27:46.670
You know,the offer's still open.

27:46.710 --> 27:48.170
You can come stay at my house.

27:48.210 --> 27:51.170
I honestly don't think
that's going to be necessary.

27:55.650 --> 27:57.640
I have to tell you something.

27:57.680 --> 28:00.200
Something else?

28:02.250 --> 28:04.940
This is going to sound crazy.

28:06.950 --> 28:09.940
Ever since I was a little girl...

28:09.980 --> 28:13.670
I've seen things... dreamt things.

28:13.710 --> 28:16.100
It took me a long time to understand

28:16.150 --> 28:18.100
that they were messages...

28:18.150 --> 28:21.100
messages from dead people,

28:21.150 --> 28:23.240
showing me things that had happened,

28:23.280 --> 28:24.740
things that were going to happen.

28:24.780 --> 28:28.740
You dream messages from dead people?

28:28.780 --> 28:30.740
All of my life.

28:30.780 --> 28:32.570
And my work with the District Attorney

28:32.610 --> 28:34.770
is almost exclusively about that,

28:34.810 --> 28:36.770
about victims coming to me...

28:36.810 --> 28:39.000
telling me things,showing me things...

28:39.050 --> 28:41.070
things that make it possible

28:41.110 --> 28:43.440
for the District Attorney
and I to obtain justice

28:43.480 --> 28:44.940
for those who have passed...

28:44.980 --> 28:46.270
and once in a while,

28:46.310 --> 28:47.940
like now...

28:47.980 --> 28:50.740
to stop something horrible
from ever happening.

28:52.780 --> 28:55.600
So you dream these things

28:55.650 --> 28:57.240
and then you tell the District Attorney,

28:57.280 --> 28:59.240
and he listens?

28:59.280 --> 29:01.840
Anyone else?

29:01.880 --> 29:03.440
My husband.

29:03.480 --> 29:04.770
Obviously.

29:04.810 --> 29:07.200
And a detective

29:07.250 --> 29:09.540
on the force and a woman
in the mayor's office,

29:09.580 --> 29:11.200
and now you.

29:11.250 --> 29:12.540
Okay.

29:12.580 --> 29:15.000
I saw you,Debra,on that bed.

29:15.050 --> 29:16.340
He took your head...

29:16.380 --> 29:18.600
and in its place was the
head of Cheryl Ann Potts,

29:18.650 --> 29:20.140
the third victim,the woman he killed

29:20.180 --> 29:22.140
last night.

29:22.180 --> 29:24.140
Okay.

29:24.180 --> 29:26.740
What was I wearing?

29:28.810 --> 29:30.440
Work clothes.

29:30.480 --> 29:32.640
Not a robe or underwear?

29:32.680 --> 29:34.640
So as long as I don't change

29:34.680 --> 29:36.870
I guess I'm... I'm safe for tonight?

29:36.910 --> 29:38.400
You don't believe me.

29:38.450 --> 29:40.540
We do have officers watching you.

29:40.580 --> 29:42.440
We have since yesterday.

29:42.480 --> 29:44.640
You won't see them,or
at least you shouldn't,

29:44.680 --> 29:45.870
but if you get in trouble...

29:45.910 --> 29:47.200
Okay,you know what? I,I...

29:47.250 --> 29:50.740
I have my magic robe and
my invisible bodyguards.

29:50.780 --> 29:54.170
And I really need you to leave now.

29:54.210 --> 29:57.000
You will call me?

29:57.050 --> 29:59.470
You will think about
everything I have told you

29:59.510 --> 30:01.140
and you will call me?

30:01.180 --> 30:03.100
Please?

30:04.800 --> 30:06.730
I WILL CALL YOU

30:16.840 --> 30:18.120
MAN Hi,I'm Howie Mandel.

30:18.130 --> 30:21.080
<i>Welcome to Deal or No Deal.</i>

30:21.130 --> 30:22.350
Thank you.

30:22.390 --> 30:25.320
...I've always said,

30:25.360 --> 30:26.340
I have the best audience in the world...

30:26.350 --> 30:27.040
Hey,babies.

30:28.220 --> 30:29.500
Any of you know where Daddy is?

30:30.530 --> 30:32.780
...I promise to take great
care of you tonight. I promise.

30:32.830 --> 30:35.120
And what does taking great
care of you mean? It means...

30:36.140 --> 30:39.230
When did Howie Mandel
become our baby-sitter?

30:39.240 --> 30:40.950
What can I tell you? He was available

30:40.960 --> 30:42.330
and the price was right.

30:45.360 --> 30:47.720
I wasn't expecting you home so early.

30:47.760 --> 30:50.150
Shouldn't you be ordering your
second drink right about now?

30:50.190 --> 30:54.350
No drinks were ordered,at
least not by me.

30:56.390 --> 30:57.950
Remember that conversation we had

30:57.990 --> 31:00.750
about how hard it is for me
to make friends and keep them?

31:00.790 --> 31:02.620
Nothing's changed.

31:02.660 --> 31:04.980
I'm sorry.

31:05.030 --> 31:08.020
She thinks I'm insane.

31:08.060 --> 31:10.520
You know,I'm actually praying

31:10.560 --> 31:12.550
with all of my heart

31:12.560 --> 31:14.440
that she's proven right.

31:16.410 --> 31:18.130
I called Scanlon.

31:18.590 --> 31:20.620
They tripled the detail watching her.

31:20.630 --> 31:22.410
Even got the hotel to agree

31:22.420 --> 31:24.430
to let us put guards in the hall.

31:25.990 --> 31:28.150
I really don't know what else to do.

31:28.160 --> 31:30.140
All you can do is all you can do.

31:30.610 --> 31:31.960
Well,I did it all.

31:32.310 --> 31:33.810
I even told her how I knew.

31:33.820 --> 31:35.040
Wow.

31:35.060 --> 31:36.620
Did that help?

31:36.660 --> 31:37.850
No.

31:37.890 --> 31:39.880
It made things worse.

31:39.930 --> 31:42.220
So,how was your day?

31:42.260 --> 31:44.750
I dodged calls from the lawyer.

31:44.790 --> 31:46.780
Dodged calls from my boss.

31:48.430 --> 31:50.120
Flipped a lot of coins.

31:50.160 --> 31:51.450
Nothing new.

31:51.490 --> 31:54.020
Well,I'm going to go
put the girls to sleep.

31:54.060 --> 31:56.020
Okay.

31:57.830 --> 31:59.550
Next contestant is...

31:59.590 --> 32:01.580
Allison Dubois.

32:01.630 --> 32:03.280
Allison!

32:03.330 --> 32:04.920
Allison.

32:04.960 --> 32:07.230
Allison,come on up.

32:07.240 --> 32:08.310
I... I do this.

32:08.320 --> 32:09.300
I do this.

32:09.310 --> 32:10.460
Thank you. Uh...

32:10.970 --> 32:12.410
<i>Welcome to Deal or No Deal.</i>

32:12.420 --> 32:14.510
Tell me a little bit
about yourself. Uh...

32:14.550 --> 32:16.180
I'm live in Phoenix,Arizona,

32:16.220 --> 32:18.510
uh,with my husband and
our three daughters.

32:18.550 --> 32:20.010
He's an aerospace engineer.

32:20.050 --> 32:21.510
I work with the District
Attorney's Office.

32:21.550 --> 32:22.580
Wow!

32:22.620 --> 32:23.680
Wow,so we have a...

32:23.720 --> 32:25.180
They love that.

32:25.220 --> 32:26.780
Yeah. Woo!

32:26.820 --> 32:27.610
We have a...

32:27.650 --> 32:29.280
a rocket scientist and a lawyer.

32:29.320 --> 32:30.940
You two sound like
quite the Dynamic Duo.

32:30.990 --> 32:32.840
We try. You try?

32:32.890 --> 32:34.640
Well,let's try to win you some money.

32:34.690 --> 32:35.640
You ready? Yeah.

32:35.690 --> 32:36.980
Here we go. Okay.

32:37.020 --> 32:39.310
We've got 26 lovely
ladies holding 26 cases.

32:39.350 --> 32:41.440
Each of them has a random
amount placed in them

32:41.490 --> 32:42.510
by a third party.

32:42.550 --> 32:43.940
We don't know what's in what case,

32:43.990 --> 32:45.610
but we do know,one case is holding

32:45.650 --> 32:47.710
one million dollars.

32:47.750 --> 32:49.780
Woo!

32:49.820 --> 32:52.440
And all I'm going to
ask you to do right now

32:52.490 --> 32:53.810
is pick the one

32:53.850 --> 32:55.380
with one million dollars in it.

32:55.420 --> 32:56.680
That's all you got to do. Okay.

32:56.720 --> 32:58.310
Okay,Allison?

32:58.350 --> 33:00.140
Okay. Got a number in mind?

33:00.190 --> 33:02.980
I'm going to go with case #3.

33:03.020 --> 33:05.340
3. Lisa,open your case.

33:05.390 --> 33:06.340
Woo!

33:08.920 --> 33:10.440
There you go.

33:10.490 --> 33:11.610
Thank you.

33:15.590 --> 33:17.280
Okay.

33:17.320 --> 33:18.480
All right.

33:18.520 --> 33:20.380
So you think there's a
million dollars in this case?

33:20.420 --> 33:22.010
I do. You do?

33:22.050 --> 33:23.980
Well,let's find out.
You know how we do that?

33:24.020 --> 33:25.280
By eliminating those.

33:25.320 --> 33:27.240
Whatever's in those is not in yours.

33:27.290 --> 33:28.810
We're going to start
by opening six cases

33:28.850 --> 33:30.480
before we call our banker.

33:30.520 --> 33:31.510
Pick some cases.

33:31.550 --> 33:33.040
Pick the ones with the small amounts.

33:33.090 --> 33:34.380
Keep the large amounts in play,

33:34.420 --> 33:35.640
and the offers will go up,okay?

33:35.690 --> 33:36.710
Okay. Start with the small amounts.

33:36.750 --> 33:38.740
I'm going to go with

33:38.790 --> 33:40.880
case... #9!

33:40.920 --> 33:42.910
#9. Patricia.

33:44.750 --> 33:46.510
Patricia,open the case.

33:49.950 --> 33:52.880
One penny
- smallest amount up there.

33:52.920 --> 33:54.740
Okay. We're off to a good start.

33:54.790 --> 33:55.940
Five more cases.

33:55.990 --> 33:57.580
#15!

33:57.620 --> 33:58.910
15. Brooke.

33:58.950 --> 34:00.110
Brooke,

34:00.150 --> 34:01.240
open the case.

34:01.290 --> 34:02.910
Okay.

34:05.420 --> 34:06.280
A dollar!

34:08.120 --> 34:10.380
You're off to a really good start.

34:10.420 --> 34:13.739
I don't think I've ever
seen anybody do that before.

34:13.790 --> 34:15.040
#10!

34:15.090 --> 34:18.409
#10. Okay.

34:18.449 --> 34:19.510
Tania,

34:19.550 --> 34:21.239
open your case.

34:26.320 --> 34:28.080
This is... This is

34:28.120 --> 34:29.280
getting weird.

34:29.320 --> 34:31.940
That is... That is unbelievable.

34:31.989 --> 34:34.540
That is unbelievable,Allison
- the three lowest amounts

34:34.590 --> 34:36.980
in a row. What-What do
you... You have x-ray vision?

34:37.020 --> 34:38.880
I don't know what to say.

34:38.920 --> 34:41.380
Uh,I-I'm a good guesser.
I always have been.

34:41.420 --> 34:43.810
Oh,I can see that.

34:43.850 --> 34:45.340
My God,let's keep going.

34:45.389 --> 34:46.610
Okay. All right.

34:46.650 --> 34:49.210
Case #26!

34:49.250 --> 34:50.040
#26.

34:52.190 --> 34:53.440
14!

34:53.489 --> 34:54.280
14.

34:56.150 --> 34:57.740
Case #7!

34:59.850 --> 35:01.840
Yes!

35:01.890 --> 35:03.110
Yeah!

35:03.150 --> 35:04.780
I am,uh... I'm speechless.

35:04.820 --> 35:06.980
My hands are actually shaking. They are.

35:07.020 --> 35:08.180
This is,uh... It's amazing.

35:08.220 --> 35:11.310
I'm-I'm sure the banker's
hands are also shaking.

35:11.350 --> 35:12.580
Let's get a call from him

35:12.620 --> 35:13.580
and an offer.

35:13.620 --> 35:15.640
Okay. And see what he's offering.

35:17.290 --> 35:18.810
Call me.

35:18.850 --> 35:21.240
Okay,here we go.

35:21.290 --> 35:24.110
Hello?

35:27.890 --> 35:29.740
Okay.

35:33.420 --> 35:35.540
Okay,um...

35:35.590 --> 35:38.210
apparently,uh,we need to stop tape.

35:38.250 --> 35:39.610
And...

35:39.650 --> 35:40.810
Excuse me?

35:40.850 --> 35:42.610
Okay. No,I'm sorry,folks.

35:42.650 --> 35:44.380
I'm sorry. We,uh...

35:44.420 --> 35:45.540
This'll just be a minute.

35:45.590 --> 35:46.710
Let's get another contestant,

35:46.750 --> 35:48.010
and we'll,uh... we'll start again.

35:48.050 --> 35:49.180
What's going on?

35:50.390 --> 35:51.880
I don't understand.

35:51.920 --> 35:54.840
I think you know
exactly what's going on.

35:54.890 --> 35:56.780
You are cheating,Mrs. Dubois.

35:57.990 --> 36:00.240
Cheating?

36:00.290 --> 36:03.040
The banker knows exactly
what's happening here.

36:20.410 --> 36:22.100
Thought you'd want
one last status report

36:22.110 --> 36:23.530
before you headed home.

36:23.580 --> 36:25.970
It's hard to imagine how
anyone's going to get to her.

36:25.980 --> 36:28.670
I mean,we have her covered
like nobody's business.

36:28.680 --> 36:30.790
And I guess it's
freaking her out a little.

36:30.800 --> 36:33.300
According to my guys,she didn't
even leave the hotel today.

36:33.310 --> 36:34.500
Worked from her room,

36:34.540 --> 36:36.670
and when she did step out
to go to the coffee shop,

36:36.710 --> 36:38.300
they said she didn't look too pleased

36:38.340 --> 36:39.670
about our being in the hallway.

36:39.710 --> 36:41.600
Well,I guess that's the price you pay

36:41.640 --> 36:45.000
to keep your head when everyone
around you is losing theirs.

36:51.240 --> 36:52.830
Hello?

36:52.880 --> 36:54.430
Allison,it's Manuel Devalos.

36:54.480 --> 36:55.730
Where am I catching you?

36:55.780 --> 36:57.200
In the car,headed home.

36:57.240 --> 36:58.830
Is everything all right?

36:58.880 --> 37:01.800
Is there any chance I can
get you to come back here?

37:01.840 --> 37:03.830
There's something I
need to discuss with you.

37:03.880 --> 37:05.330
Something I need to... show you.

37:15.010 --> 37:16.570
Thanks for coming back.

37:16.610 --> 37:17.970
No problem.

37:18.010 --> 37:19.200
I just,uh...

37:19.240 --> 37:20.570
got the damnedest call,

37:20.610 --> 37:23.530
the,uh... damnedest fax.

37:23.580 --> 37:25.500
I don't remember if
I mentioned it to you,

37:25.540 --> 37:27.570
but this national reporter,P.D. McCall,

37:27.610 --> 37:30.400
has been writing some
pretty nasty pieces about me,

37:30.440 --> 37:32.500
about this Paxton thing.

37:32.540 --> 37:34.330
Got another one coming out on Sunday.

37:34.380 --> 37:36.170
Just faxed me a copy of it.

37:36.210 --> 37:37.930
Wanted to know if I had any comment.

37:37.980 --> 37:39.700
Well,how bad is it?

37:39.740 --> 37:41.770
Pretty tough stuff.

37:41.810 --> 37:43.770
Quotes from an insider

37:43.810 --> 37:45.970
talking about some of the
inner workings of this office.

37:46.010 --> 37:48.830
Even talked about some
of the work you do for us.

37:48.880 --> 37:50.130
Me?

37:50.180 --> 37:52.130
He mentions me?

37:52.180 --> 37:54.130
How is that possible?

37:54.180 --> 37:55.600
Where did he get that?

37:55.640 --> 37:57.070
Who would tell him?

37:57.110 --> 37:59.030
Where would something
like that come from?

37:59.080 --> 38:01.270
Well,I read the piece twice.

38:01.310 --> 38:03.500
The only thing that makes any sense...

38:04.780 --> 38:06.530
is it apparently came from you,Allison.

38:06.580 --> 38:08.070
Me?

38:08.110 --> 38:09.870
"The District Attorney's Office

38:09.910 --> 38:12.870
"seems to be held in a thrall
by a self-professed psychic

38:12.910 --> 38:16.430
"named Allison Dubois,whose
dreams,vague feelings

38:16.480 --> 38:19.200
"and prognostications appear
to have been the primary basis

38:19.240 --> 38:20.670
for Walter Paxton's prosecution. "

38:20.710 --> 38:21.970
I swear,I never...

38:22.010 --> 38:23.270
I would never...

38:23.310 --> 38:24.830
I didn't talk to this person.

38:24.880 --> 38:26.930
I don't even know a P.D. McCall.

38:26.980 --> 38:28.970
I think maybe you do.

38:30.540 --> 38:32.630
"But Mrs. Dubois' influence

"to the District Attorney's Office.

"At one point,she actually

"that I would be the Recapitator's

"When I explained that I couldn't

protection for me. "

38:55.310 --> 38:57.430
No... it can't be.

38:57.480 --> 38:59.000
She wouldn't.

38:59.040 --> 39:00.400
I did some checking.

39:00.440 --> 39:01.830
McCall was her married name.

39:01.880 --> 39:03.270
She's divorced now.

39:03.310 --> 39:05.000
Her maiden name... is Livingston.

39:05.040 --> 39:08.270
Paladin Debra Livingston.

39:24.880 --> 39:28.600
P.D.!

39:28.640 --> 39:32.100
You're not at all who
you say you are,are you?

39:32.140 --> 39:34.200
You didn't hit my car.

39:34.240 --> 39:36.630
You don't sell things for a living.

39:36.680 --> 39:38.800
You don't even go by the name Debra!

39:38.840 --> 39:41.330
Okay,but then,if you
were really the psychic

39:41.380 --> 39:43.330
you claim to be,wouldn't
you have known that?

39:43.380 --> 39:46.170
I can't believe I let
you use me this way.

39:46.210 --> 39:47.400
Please.

39:47.440 --> 39:49.430
You know,at the end of the day,

39:49.480 --> 39:51.730
this really has very
little to do with you.

39:51.780 --> 39:54.500
You just happen to work
for a man who I think-

39:54.540 --> 39:57.230
who a lot of people are starting to think
- is reckless,

39:57.280 --> 39:59.070
foolhardy in the way that he chooses

39:59.110 --> 40:00.670
to handle the people's business.

40:00.710 --> 40:03.230
Believe me,I just took
a shot in the dark.

40:03.280 --> 40:06.330
I had no idea when I
told you I'd hit your car

40:06.380 --> 40:08.630
that you'd end up being
such a rich source.

40:08.680 --> 40:10.670
I was just hoping maybe you'd tell me

40:10.710 --> 40:12.470
he was using the office postage meter

40:12.510 --> 40:14.470
for personal mail.

40:14.510 --> 40:16.600
So,that's all I am,is the source?

40:16.640 --> 40:18.370
Doesn't it matter at all

40:18.410 --> 40:21.330
that the man you're trying
to destroy is a great man?

40:21.380 --> 40:23.370
A great lawyer?

40:23.410 --> 40:25.100
A terrific district attorney?

40:25.140 --> 40:27.870
A man who loves this
city and its people?

40:27.910 --> 40:30.070
I'm sure he has a good heart.

40:30.110 --> 40:32.170
You cannot run this story.

40:32.210 --> 40:34.230
Debra... please.

40:34.280 --> 40:36.370
I befriended you.

40:36.410 --> 40:38.170
I told you things in confidence.

40:38.210 --> 40:39.770
Crazy things,Allison.

40:39.810 --> 40:42.400
Crazy things that people

40:42.440 --> 40:44.430
who should know better
apparently listen to.

40:44.480 --> 40:46.070
And that,all by itself-

40:46.110 --> 40:48.430
that's reason enough
for me to run the story.

40:48.480 --> 40:50.870
I told you those things
to save your life!

40:50.910 --> 40:52.470
To get you to hear.

40:52.510 --> 40:53.900
To get you to listen!

40:53.940 --> 40:55.330
And what about me?

40:55.380 --> 40:56.800
<i>What about my life?</i>

40:56.840 --> 40:58.570
My husband's life?

40:58.610 --> 41:00.070
My children's lives?

41:00.110 --> 41:02.370
Are you going to print those secrets,

41:02.410 --> 41:04.400
make it impossible for us to live...?

41:04.440 --> 41:06.400
Allison,stop.

41:06.440 --> 41:09.870
You are a lovely person.

41:09.910 --> 41:11.730
But you are also a menace.

41:11.780 --> 41:14.400
A
nice,well-meaning,good-natured

41:14.440 --> 41:16.530
menace,and I like you.

41:16.580 --> 41:18.700
And I do care about you.

41:18.740 --> 41:20.800
And it is my deepest wish that someone,

41:20.840 --> 41:23.530
anyone close to you,find
you the mental health care

41:23.580 --> 41:25.770
that you so obviously,desperately need.

41:29.940 --> 41:31.500
McCall here.

41:31.540 --> 41:33.670
Hello?

41:33.710 --> 41:36.400
Lee?

41:36.440 --> 41:38.630
Oh,no.

41:38.680 --> 41:40.330
Where?

41:40.380 --> 41:42.430
Monamore Hotel?

41:42.480 --> 41:44.570
I'm on my way.

41:44.610 --> 41:47.230
Okay.

41:47.280 --> 41:50.470
Wow. Bad news travels fast.

41:50.510 --> 41:52.470
Poor woman.

41:52.510 --> 41:54.500
Victim #4.

41:54.540 --> 41:56.100
Funny thing,though-

41:56.140 --> 41:59.270
I thought victim #4
was supposed to be me.

42:03.010 --> 42:05.300
Good-bye,Allison.
