13:12.199 --> 13:16.066
YOU THINK YOU CAN HANDLE IT?

13:16.068 --> 13:17.333
YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT

13:17.335 --> 13:19.768
WE CAN HANDLE.

13:29.578 --> 13:30.610
THE BRAIN BUILT THESE THINGS

13:30.612 --> 13:32.011
TO SCAVENGE RAW MATERIAL.

13:32.013 --> 13:32.911
HE'S GOT THE WHOLE JUNGLE

13:32.913 --> 13:34.012
CRAWLING WITH THEM.

13:34.014 --> 13:35.046
SO IF WE FOLLOW ONE,

13:35.048 --> 13:36.514
IT MIGHT LEAD US TO THE BRAIN.

13:36.516 --> 13:37.548
WELL, AREN'T YOU

13:37.550 --> 13:39.483
THE CLEVER ONE?

14:00.305 --> 14:01.937
I'D SAY WE FOUND IT.

14:01.939 --> 14:04.306
ANY IDEA WHAT IT IS?

14:23.259 --> 14:25.759
IT SEEMS OUR WORK HERE

14:25.761 --> 14:27.494
IS DONE.

14:27.496 --> 14:29.629
I'M SO GLAD YOU COULD WITNESS

14:29.631 --> 14:33.232
MY MOMENT OF TRIUMPH, MENTO.

14:33.234 --> 14:35.100
TRIUMPH OVER WHAT?

14:35.102 --> 14:36.568
ALL I'VE SEEN YOU DO IS

14:36.570 --> 14:38.236
CHEW UP JUNGLE.

14:38.238 --> 14:39.570
I'VE FORGOTTEN.

14:39.572 --> 14:41.471
YOUR CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCE

14:41.473 --> 14:43.272
PREVENTS YOU FROM READING

14:43.274 --> 14:44.940
MY MIND.

14:44.942 --> 14:46.975
THEN ALLOW ME TO GIVE YOU

14:46.977 --> 14:48.343
A TASTE.

14:48.345 --> 14:50.078
WHAT YOU ONCE DESTROYED

14:50.080 --> 14:53.181
HAS BEEN REBUILT.

14:53.183 --> 14:54.248
EVEN IF THAT'S TRUE, YOU'LL

14:54.250 --> 14:55.515
NEVER GET AWAY WITH IT.

14:55.517 --> 14:57.917
YOU SEEM TO FORGET, MENTO,

14:57.919 --> 15:02.654
I AM THE ONE WHO HAS YOU.

15:02.656 --> 15:05.790
AHH...

15:05.792 --> 15:08.225
LEAVE HIM ALONE!

15:14.432 --> 15:17.466
I'VE BEEN SEPARATED TOO LONG.

15:17.468 --> 15:19.968
I NEED TO GET BACK TO MY BODY.

15:19.970 --> 15:21.936
AH...

15:40.823 --> 15:43.023
FROM HERE, WE SPLIT UP.

15:43.025 --> 15:44.791
CYBORG, YOU'LL TAKE THE FRONT.

15:44.793 --> 15:46.192
STARFIRE AND RAVEN, TAKE OUT

15:46.194 --> 15:47.193
THOSE GUARD TOWERS.

15:47.195 --> 15:48.994
BEAST BOY, YOU'VE GOT TO GET THE

15:48.996 --> 15:54.966
SECURITY DOOR OPEN.

15:54.968 --> 16:00.905
AND WHAT ABOUT THESE GUYS?

16:00.907 --> 16:02.806
NOW CAN I BEAT THEM UP?

16:02.808 --> 16:05.241
TITANS, GO!

16:20.724 --> 16:22.990
CONGRATULATIONS,

16:22.992 --> 16:24.391
YOU BUILT A BATTERY.

16:24.393 --> 16:26.326
YOU MOCK WHAT YOU COULDN'T

16:26.328 --> 16:28.695
POSSIBLY UNDERSTAND.

16:28.697 --> 16:31.431
EVERYTHING IS NOW IN PLACE.

16:31.433 --> 16:33.666
MY ONLY DESIRE IS AN ADMISSION

16:33.668 --> 16:35.067
OF DEFEAT.

16:35.069 --> 16:36.535
NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

16:36.537 --> 16:37.936
THEN YOUR SUFFERING WILL

16:37.938 --> 16:40.038
ONLY BE PROLONGED.

16:40.040 --> 16:46.243
WE'LL START WITH THE GIRL.

16:46.245 --> 16:49.745
UH!

16:49.747 --> 16:51.580
AH, STEVE!

16:51.582 --> 16:53.615
IT'S CRUSHING ME!

16:53.617 --> 16:54.949
NO!

16:54.951 --> 16:56.517
THEN CEDE!

16:56.519 --> 16:59.820
ADMIT THAT I HAVE WON.

17:03.925 --> 17:06.358
WON WHAT?

17:06.360 --> 17:09.361
SURE AIN'T A BEAUTY CONTEST.

17:09.363 --> 17:11.363
YOUR TIN SOLDIER SEEMS TO BE

17:11.365 --> 17:13.431
FIXED, MENTO.

17:13.433 --> 17:16.400
YOU CAN THANK US FOR THAT.

17:16.402 --> 17:18.135
OH, LOOK,

17:18.137 --> 17:19.569
THE LITTLE GREEN ONE.

17:19.571 --> 17:20.870
HOW NICE.

17:20.872 --> 17:22.972
A FAMILY REUNION.

17:22.974 --> 17:25.774
WHOA!

18:16.592 --> 18:18.058
GOOD SHOT!

18:18.060 --> 18:22.395
WHOEVER YOU ARE.

18:22.397 --> 18:23.529
"WHOEVER YOU ARE"?

18:23.531 --> 18:25.597
HEY, I'VE SAVED THE EARTH...

18:25.599 --> 18:28.733
SEVERAL TIMES.

18:28.735 --> 18:29.700
ARGH!

18:29.702 --> 18:34.304
UH!

18:34.306 --> 18:35.638
UH.

18:35.640 --> 18:37.606
UH.

18:37.608 --> 18:38.974
COULD YOU HAVE AT LEAST THAWED

18:38.976 --> 18:41.343
ME OUT FIRST?

18:56.993 --> 19:01.561
NO!

19:01.563 --> 19:02.728
ARGH!

19:02.730 --> 19:03.662
AH!

19:03.664 --> 19:05.163
UH!

19:13.005 --> 19:14.738
MENTO, I'M HERE.

19:14.740 --> 19:15.905
I GOT YOUR MESSAGE.

19:15.907 --> 19:17.306
BEAST BOY, LOOK OUT!

19:17.308 --> 19:22.277
AH!

19:22.279 --> 19:26.014
ALL OF YOU, TAKE 'EM DOWN.

20:12.962 --> 20:15.896
FOOLS RUSH IN, DON'T THEY,

20:15.898 --> 20:18.531
MONSIEUR MALLAH?

20:23.670 --> 20:26.603
OH, GREAT.

20:29.474 --> 20:31.340
AND A THERMOGENIC

20:31.342 --> 20:33.141
CHAIN REACTION.

20:33.143 --> 20:34.976
WELL DONE, MENTO.

20:34.978 --> 20:36.811
I COULDN'T HAVE FOUND A BETTER

20:36.813 --> 20:39.079
END FOR YOU MYSELF.

20:47.421 --> 20:50.188
AH...

20:50.190 --> 20:53.857
BEAST BOY, STOP THEM!

20:53.859 --> 20:57.560
SO NOW I EXIST.

20:57.562 --> 20:59.261
THIS PLACE IS COMING DOWN!

20:59.263 --> 21:00.862
YOU GOT TO GET US OUT!

21:00.864 --> 21:02.864
PLEASE, YOU MUST HURRY.

21:02.866 --> 21:04.031
NEVER MIND US!

21:04.033 --> 21:08.869
GET THAT POWER CORE!

21:08.871 --> 21:10.503
DIFFICULT CHOICE,

21:10.505 --> 21:12.171
IS IT NOT?

21:15.376 --> 21:16.608
BEAST BOY, DON'T MAKE THE

21:16.610 --> 21:18.409
SAME MISTAKE TWICE!

21:18.411 --> 21:20.411
DO WHAT I SAY!

21:31.523 --> 21:33.689
YOU DID IT, BEAST BOY.

21:33.691 --> 21:35.390
AND JUST IN THE NICK OF TIME.

21:35.392 --> 21:37.625
WE ARE MOST THANKFUL.

21:43.566 --> 21:45.866
I GOT EVERYONE OUT SAFE.

21:45.868 --> 21:46.766
BUT YOU LET THE BRAIN

21:46.768 --> 21:48.367
GET AWAY.

21:48.369 --> 21:50.469
HOW COULD YOU BE SO FOOLISH?

21:50.471 --> 21:51.870
MENTO--

21:51.872 --> 21:54.372
HE SAVED OUR LIVES.

21:54.374 --> 21:55.406
DOESN'T THAT MEAN ANYTHING

21:55.408 --> 21:56.407
TO YOU?

21:56.409 --> 21:57.241
NO.

21:57.243 --> 21:58.075
HE'S ONLY DELAYED

21:58.077 --> 21:59.242
OUR DESTRUCTION.

21:59.244 --> 22:00.409
YOU'LL KEEP LOOKING FOR HIM,

22:00.411 --> 22:01.910
JUST LIKE YOU ALWAYS DID...

22:01.912 --> 22:03.378
SIR.

22:03.380 --> 22:05.780
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

22:05.782 --> 22:07.581
I READ THE BRAIN'S MIND,

22:07.583 --> 22:08.782
BEAST BOY.

22:08.784 --> 22:11.050
HE HAS A NEW QUANTUM GENERATOR,

22:11.052 --> 22:13.052
AND IT WORKS.

22:13.054 --> 22:14.486
THE MOST DEVASTATING POWER IN

22:14.488 --> 22:15.987
THE COSMOS IS NOW IN THE HANDS

22:15.989 --> 22:18.456
OF A MADMAN BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T

22:18.458 --> 22:20.124
FOLLOW ORDERS.

22:23.662 --> 22:26.095
WE'VE GOT A PLANET TO SAVE.

22:26.097 --> 22:28.497
DOOM PATROL, MOVE OUT!

22:51.021 --> 22:53.688
