[jazz music]

00:04.000 --> 00:12.000
â™ª â™ª

00:20.000 --> 00:23.100
- From the Penn & Teller Theater
in Las Vegas, Nevada,

00:23.100 --> 00:26.670
here's our host,
Alyson Hannigan.

00:26.670 --> 00:29.670
[cheers and applause]

00:40.200 --> 00:42.530
- Welcome to
"Penn & Teller: Fool Us."

00:42.530 --> 00:45.429
Tonight we have a great show,
as usual.

00:45.429 --> 00:48.500
Amazing magicians
trying to fool Penn and Teller.

00:48.500 --> 00:51.200
But we also have
a very special surprise

00:51.200 --> 00:53.200
that involves everyone watching.

00:53.200 --> 00:55.270
And here to tell you
all about it,

00:55.270 --> 00:59.100
the two and only
Penn and Teller.

00:59.100 --> 01:02.200
[cheers and applause]

01:04.200 --> 01:05.829
Hello.

01:05.829 --> 01:07.200
Hi.

01:07.200 --> 01:09.030
[cheers and applause]

01:09.030 --> 01:10.069
- Our last trick tonight

01:10.069 --> 01:13.000
is gonna happen in your homes,
I mean all of ya's.

01:13.000 --> 01:17.900
Find yourself four cards,
same backs, different faces.

01:17.900 --> 01:20.329
And you're gonna ruin them,
so take them from an old deck.

01:20.329 --> 01:22.569
But have four cards ready
at the end of the show.

01:22.569 --> 01:26.099
And we'll make the magic happen
right in front of your TV.

01:26.099 --> 01:27.900
You at home, get ready.

01:27.900 --> 01:29.329
- Yes, I saved you seats.

01:29.329 --> 01:30.329
- Good, let's go.

01:30.329 --> 01:32.069
- They're good,
very good ones.

01:32.069 --> 01:35.099
[cheers and applause]

01:35.099 --> 01:37.229
Remember, any magician
clever enough

01:37.229 --> 01:40.000
to fool Penn and Teller
wins a trip back to Vegas

01:40.000 --> 01:43.069
to perform in their
famous Las Vegas show.

01:43.069 --> 01:46.069
Let's meet our first
potential fooler.

01:49.069 --> 01:50.229
- My name is Shawn Farquhar,

01:50.229 --> 01:52.200
and I'm
a professional magician.

01:52.200 --> 01:53.700
Magic is truly in my DNA.

01:53.700 --> 01:55.270
I learned my numbers
from a deck of cards,

01:55.270 --> 01:57.069
which probably explains why,
in grade school,

01:57.069 --> 01:59.069
I thought after ten came jack.

01:59.069 --> 02:00.530
I eat, sleep, and drink magic.

02:00.530 --> 02:02.099
[rock music]

02:02.099 --> 02:04.030
Oh, sorry, I had something
stuck in my throat.

02:04.030 --> 02:08.098
Every job I ever took ended up
going back towards magic.

02:08.098 --> 02:09.330
I worked in a pizza place,

02:09.330 --> 02:12.000
and I was doing tricks
with the pepperoni.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.099
I would entertain the people
who watched through the window.

02:15.099 --> 02:16.729
Actually, it's my second time
on "Fool Us.'

02:16.729 --> 02:23.199
- We have no idea
how you got the [bleep] ball.

02:23.199 --> 02:24.500
- It was probably the best

02:24.500 --> 02:26.170
performance experience
I've ever done,

02:26.170 --> 02:27.900
next to winning
the World Championship.

02:27.900 --> 02:29.670
I never imagined
I'd fool them the first time.

02:29.670 --> 02:31.000
It was a long shot.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.870
But then, winning the Powerball
is a long shot,

02:32.870 --> 02:35.030
and there's always a winner
in that, too.

02:35.030 --> 02:38.030
[cheers and applause]

02:39.729 --> 02:41.199
- For the first time ever,

02:41.199 --> 02:44.900
we're bringing back someone who
already fooled Penn and Teller.

02:44.900 --> 02:46.030
- Oh, no.

02:46.030 --> 02:47.670
- Here to see if he can
do it again,

02:47.670 --> 02:51.829
please welcome Shawn Farquhar.

02:51.829 --> 02:52.829
[applause]

02:52.829 --> 02:54.670
- Wow.

02:54.670 --> 02:55.829
Back on the "Fool Us" stage.

02:55.829 --> 02:57.400
You know the first word
that comes to mind?

02:57.400 --> 02:59.199
Deja vu.

02:59.199 --> 03:01.270
Gentlemen, if you recall,
the last time I was here,

03:01.270 --> 03:02.930
I was the world champion
of card magic,

03:02.930 --> 03:04.069
and I did a card trick.

03:04.069 --> 03:05.699
And for me,
it was an awesome memory.

03:05.699 --> 03:07.000
And speaking
of awesome memories,

03:07.000 --> 03:08.500
that's what I'm gonna
demonstrate tonight,

03:08.500 --> 03:09.569
with the help of Alyson.

03:09.569 --> 03:11.000
Would you mind helping
for a moment?

03:11.000 --> 03:12.830
- Oh, sure.
- Thank you so much.

03:12.830 --> 03:14.000
- Alyson, I have a book.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.669
This is "The Adventures
of Sherlock Holmes."

03:15.669 --> 03:17.030
I want you to take
a look at the book

03:17.030 --> 03:18.170
and make sure that
all the pages are different,

03:18.170 --> 03:21.069
that it's not one page
repeated over and over again.

03:21.069 --> 03:22.430
Every page is different
in the book.

03:22.430 --> 03:23.430
It's a real book, yes?

03:23.430 --> 03:24.569
- Yes.

03:24.569 --> 03:26.030
- There are 200 and some odd
pages in there.

03:26.030 --> 03:28.030
Average page has between
200 and 250 words,

03:28.030 --> 03:30.930
which means there's somewhere
between 40,000 and 50,000 words.

03:30.930 --> 03:32.099
I've memorized them all--

03:32.099 --> 03:34.229
every page, every paragraph,
every sentence, and every word.

03:34.229 --> 03:35.270
And you're gonna test me.

03:35.270 --> 03:36.829
Sound like fun?
- Sure.

03:36.829 --> 03:38.099
- Alyson, pick any page
you'd like in the book.

03:38.099 --> 03:39.270
Tell me the page number,

03:39.270 --> 03:40.599
and I'll tell you
what's written on it.

03:40.599 --> 03:43.000
- Okay, 102.
- 102, it's excellent.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.829
The first two words
that appear on 102

03:44.829 --> 03:47.370
are "Sherlock" and "Holmes,"
am I right?

03:47.370 --> 03:48.670
- Yes.
- I am, yeah.

03:48.670 --> 03:49.900
I should point that out.

03:49.900 --> 03:51.930
The top of every page
says "Sherlock" and "Holmes."

03:51.930 --> 03:53.729
It's a gimme.

03:53.729 --> 03:54.870
This is way too easy.

03:54.870 --> 03:56.170
And you see,
I can see the pages,

03:56.170 --> 03:57.430
so it's not really
test conditions.

03:57.430 --> 03:59.370
Yeah, if you do that,
it just makes the book happy.

03:59.370 --> 04:00.599
Here's what we'll do.

04:00.599 --> 04:01.930
We'll do something
a little bit different.

04:01.930 --> 04:03.169
Test conditions.

04:03.169 --> 04:04.270
We'll turn so we're
not facing each other.

04:04.270 --> 04:05.900
In fact,
we'll stand back-to-back.

04:05.900 --> 04:07.030
- Hmm.

04:07.030 --> 04:09.030
- Yeah, shoulder-to-shoulder,
cheek-to-cheek.

04:09.030 --> 04:10.229
[laughter]

04:10.229 --> 04:11.599
Oh, hey, you work out.

04:11.599 --> 04:13.870
Okay, I want you
to open the book

04:13.870 --> 04:15.000
to any page you'd like to now.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.199
- A different page?

04:16.199 --> 04:18.100
- A different page, because I
already saw stuff on that page.

04:18.100 --> 04:19.699
And once you've
made a decision, say,

04:19.699 --> 04:21.069
"Shawn, I've made a decision."

04:21.069 --> 04:22.069
- I made a decision.

04:22.069 --> 04:23.069
- That's awesome.

04:23.069 --> 04:24.069
I'm happy with the decision.

04:24.069 --> 04:25.069
Are you happy
with the decision?

04:25.069 --> 04:26.069
- Sure.
- Good.

04:26.069 --> 04:27.069
Now that we're both happy,

04:27.069 --> 04:28.430
I want you to be
more like my wife.

04:28.430 --> 04:29.730
And even though we've both made
the decision and we're happy,

04:29.730 --> 04:30.829
I want you to change
your mind again.

04:30.829 --> 04:32.699
- Okay.

04:32.699 --> 04:34.399
- Is that too close for home?
- Yeah.

04:34.399 --> 04:35.899
- Are you on a new page?
- Sure.

04:35.899 --> 04:37.230
- For the firs time,
what is the page you're on?

04:37.230 --> 04:38.329
- 64.

04:38.329 --> 04:39.569
- 64, is there any way
you would have known

04:39.569 --> 04:41.399
that you weren't gonna be
on 64 tonight?

04:41.399 --> 04:42.600
- No, no.
- None, right?

04:42.600 --> 04:44.699
Good, I want you,
quietly, just to yourself,

04:44.699 --> 04:46.730
to count the number
of paragraphs

04:46.730 --> 04:49.730
that are on page 64.

04:51.730 --> 04:53.500
This was a lot easier
when I was younger.

04:53.500 --> 04:55.170
- Okay.

04:55.170 --> 04:57.500
- 64, yeah, on that side,

04:57.500 --> 04:59.069
there's one, two, three,
four, five.

04:59.069 --> 05:00.170
Five paragraphs,
am I right?

05:00.170 --> 05:01.199
- Yes.

05:01.199 --> 05:02.370
- And the first line
is actually the middle

05:02.370 --> 05:03.930
of a person's name that begins
with, like,

05:03.930 --> 05:06.199
"Von Ormstein, the Grand Duke
of Castle Feinstein."

05:06.199 --> 05:07.600
Am I right?
- Yes.

05:07.600 --> 05:09.100
- Yeah, it's continued
from the page before,

05:09.100 --> 05:11.399
which, the last three words
on that page were, like,

05:11.399 --> 05:13.199
"William Godstreet Sigmunds."

05:13.199 --> 05:14.730
Is that right?
- Yes.

05:14.730 --> 05:16.529
- Imagine that,
that I'm able to actually

05:16.529 --> 05:18.500
discern those pages
as quickly as that.

05:18.500 --> 05:20.199
Oh, it's okay,
we'll go another page.

05:20.199 --> 05:21.000
We'll go to another page.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.699
So back together,
back-to-back.

05:22.699 --> 05:24.199
Now go to a different section,

05:24.199 --> 05:26.100
maybe another 10 pages,
20 pages up,

05:26.100 --> 05:27.500
wherever you'd like to.

05:27.500 --> 05:31.069
Go to those pages, and tell me
what page you're on now.

05:31.069 --> 05:32.670
- 140.
- 140.

05:32.670 --> 05:34.000
That's an excellent choice.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.230
140.

05:35.230 --> 05:37.170
Okay, count the amount
of paragraphs

05:37.170 --> 05:38.899
that are on page 140.

05:38.899 --> 05:40.000
140.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.069
Oh, this is good.

05:41.069 --> 05:43.100
There's, like, a lot.

05:43.100 --> 05:45.069
There's, like, 11 of them.

05:45.069 --> 05:46.670
Is that right?

05:46.670 --> 05:48.769
The second paragraph says, like,

05:48.769 --> 05:50.370
"Good night,
Mr. Sherlock Holmes."

05:50.370 --> 05:51.430
- Yeah.

05:51.430 --> 05:52.430
- Which backwards
it would be, like,

05:52.430 --> 05:54.029
"Holmes Sherlock,
Mr. Night Good."

05:54.029 --> 05:55.269
Is that right?

05:55.269 --> 05:56.269
- Are you cheating?

05:56.269 --> 05:57.670
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

05:57.670 --> 05:59.069
- Okay, okay,
just a second.

05:59.069 --> 06:00.199
What did you say?

06:00.199 --> 06:01.199
- Are you cheating?

06:01.199 --> 06:02.569
I feel your back
moving a lot.

06:02.569 --> 06:03.600
- I'm moving a little bit.

06:03.600 --> 06:04.769
It's because I'm just thinking.

06:04.769 --> 06:05.769
I'm just thinking.

06:05.769 --> 06:07.269
Okay, let's try it again.

06:07.269 --> 06:08.399
Go to another page,

06:08.399 --> 06:10.069
a couple more pages
forward, maybe,

06:10.069 --> 06:11.829
just so that we're 100% sure

06:11.829 --> 06:13.529
that you're on a new page
and you're happy.

06:13.529 --> 06:15.069
- Okay.
- What page are you on now?

06:15.069 --> 06:16.069
- I'm on another page.

06:16.069 --> 06:17.069
I'm not so happy.

06:17.069 --> 06:18.069
- Oh, which one?

06:18.069 --> 06:19.569
- 136.
- Oh, 136.

06:19.569 --> 06:20.569
That's an excellent choice.

06:20.569 --> 06:21.569
130...

06:21.569 --> 06:22.569
Right about there.

06:22.569 --> 06:24.230
136, 136.

06:24.230 --> 06:26.870
Oh, it's on
the left-hand side.

06:26.870 --> 06:29.529
The first word,
the largest word on that line

06:29.529 --> 06:32.069
is the word "window,"
am I right?

06:32.069 --> 06:33.170
- Yes.

06:33.170 --> 06:34.000
- That's pretty amazing,
isn't it?

06:34.000 --> 06:35.370
Think about it.
I just used my mind, Alyson.

06:35.370 --> 06:37.000
In my mind,
I was able to discern

06:37.000 --> 06:38.069
exactly where they were.

06:38.069 --> 06:40.000
Think about it,
I mean, the chances of it.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
I mean, look at the book.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.730
Go to open up 137 again
and take a peek.

06:42.730 --> 06:43.899
Yeah, go ahead.

06:43.899 --> 06:45.170
- I could feel you moving.

06:45.170 --> 06:47.370
- Moving a whole bunch,
yeah, yeah, it was my job.

06:47.370 --> 06:49.329
137, and you can see--

06:49.329 --> 06:51.000
- And I really
don't think this is--

06:51.000 --> 06:52.670
- See, I counted,
one, two, three, four.

06:52.670 --> 06:53.670
- That's a book.

06:53.670 --> 06:55.069
- Yeah, I know
there's a book.

06:55.069 --> 06:56.930
- You know they have
their eyes open.

06:56.930 --> 06:59.029
- Oh, yeah, maybe I didn't
understand the show.

06:59.029 --> 07:00.569
I know it's supposed to be
"Fool Us,"

07:00.569 --> 07:02.670
but I was more enjoying
fooling you.

07:02.670 --> 07:07.199
- Well, I'm an easy target,
but I'm not that--

07:07.199 --> 07:09.100
- Should I share?

07:09.100 --> 07:10.699
- Yes.

07:10.699 --> 07:13.029
- My pages are blank.

07:13.029 --> 07:15.529
The entire book is blank.

07:15.529 --> 07:16.829
Did you like the glasses touch?

07:16.829 --> 07:18.170
I thought the glasses touch
was nice.

07:18.170 --> 07:19.899
There's not even, like,
glass in the glasses.

07:19.899 --> 07:22.430
I just--

07:22.430 --> 07:25.170
- Shawn Farquhar.

07:25.170 --> 07:27.870
[cheers and applause]

07:27.870 --> 07:29.529
That's crazy.

07:29.529 --> 07:31.100
- Thank you.

07:31.100 --> 07:32.029
- That was amazing.

07:32.029 --> 07:33.029
- Did you want to look?

07:33.029 --> 07:34.699
You can look.
It's cool.

07:34.699 --> 07:37.170
- That's--
there's nothing.

07:37.170 --> 07:38.899
- Oh, we did that so that
they could freak out.

07:38.899 --> 07:40.170
- I'm freaking out.

07:40.170 --> 07:41.870
First, I was like,
does he have a mirror?

07:41.870 --> 07:42.870
What's happening?

07:42.870 --> 07:44.100
He's clearly cheating.

07:44.100 --> 07:46.069
- Yeah, a mirror would have
been a much better idea.

07:46.069 --> 07:47.670
I should have used a mirror.

07:47.670 --> 07:49.870
- Well, how do you come up
with your tricks?

07:49.870 --> 07:51.000
- Sleep deprivation.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.329
- Oh, that's good.

07:52.329 --> 07:54.230
- Yeah, I gave up sleep
about four years ago,

07:54.230 --> 07:56.000
and I travel a lot.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.870
I basically live
on airplanes.

07:57.870 --> 07:58.930
And it's all changed

07:58.930 --> 08:01.029
because of my time
with Penn and Teller.

08:01.029 --> 08:04.069
I'm amazed by how cool it was
that people recognize me

08:04.069 --> 08:06.029
all over just because
of "Fool Us."

08:06.029 --> 08:08.230
- That is so cool.
- Really good.

08:08.230 --> 08:10.699
- And so, do you really think

08:10.699 --> 08:13.430
that you could
possibly do it twice?

08:13.430 --> 08:15.870
- No.

08:15.870 --> 08:18.000
When I told my daughter that
I was gonna go on the show,

08:18.000 --> 08:19.199
she said, "Why?"

08:19.199 --> 08:21.670
She said, "Do you think
you can fool them twice?"

08:21.670 --> 08:23.769
I said, "No, I really don't know
if I could do that."

08:23.769 --> 08:25.000
- That would be really cool.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.670
- Yeah, but I'm not
gonna hold my hopes,

08:26.670 --> 08:28.170
because they're talking
for a long time.

08:28.170 --> 08:30.069
- Well, that's good,
so maybe that's a good thing.

08:30.069 --> 08:31.399
- They look very satisfied.

08:31.399 --> 08:32.429
- Oh, oh.

08:32.429 --> 08:33.929
- It's frightening.

08:33.929 --> 08:36.000
- Ooh,
that's an interesting look.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.100
Penn, Teller, did he fool you?

08:39.100 --> 08:42.269
- You rat bastard.

08:42.269 --> 08:44.169
- Oh.
- There he goes again.

08:44.169 --> 08:47.100
- Is that a code word,
or is that a good thing?

08:47.100 --> 08:51.370
- Do you think
you are playing with children?

08:51.370 --> 08:52.600
- No, sir.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.399
- There are people at home
who are going,

08:54.399 --> 08:57.200
"Oh, he switched the books."

08:57.200 --> 08:59.370
And you're thinking,
oh, Penn and Teller,

08:59.370 --> 09:01.769
they're gonna say,
"He switched the books."

09:01.769 --> 09:03.029
And then you're gonna
do something

09:03.029 --> 09:04.730
like open up your coat

09:04.730 --> 09:06.529
and show there's
no other book there,

09:06.529 --> 09:08.029
or you're gonna
take off your shirt

09:08.029 --> 09:09.370
or drop your pants,

09:09.370 --> 09:12.100
or do something like that
to show there's no other book.

09:12.100 --> 09:15.269
Or maybe there is another book,
and that's blank too,

09:15.269 --> 09:17.100
just to make us
look like fools.

09:17.100 --> 09:20.899
But you, you pig dog.

09:20.899 --> 09:23.830
Fool us once, shame on you.

09:23.830 --> 09:26.269
Fool us twice, shame on us.

09:26.269 --> 09:29.500
We think it actually
is a memory trick,

09:29.500 --> 09:31.929
and there was no
book switch at all.

09:31.929 --> 09:34.070
And there is certain
kind of direction

09:34.070 --> 09:36.370
on how many paragraphs
and so on,

09:36.370 --> 09:38.330
but a lot of that
is in your head,

09:38.330 --> 09:40.700
because you are
wicked, wicked smart.

09:40.700 --> 09:42.100
And we are jaded,

09:42.100 --> 09:44.230
and we will not fall
for your jive.

09:44.230 --> 09:45.730
Bingo, we're done.

09:45.730 --> 09:47.269
Get off the stage.

09:47.269 --> 09:48.830
[cheers and applause]

09:48.830 --> 09:51.200
- Wow, what does that mean?

09:51.200 --> 09:54.570
Because I feel like
if you did fool them,

09:54.570 --> 09:57.100
they might take out
a restraining order on you.

09:57.100 --> 09:58.769
- I'm a little frightened
to tell them,

09:58.769 --> 10:01.100
but I can't remember
my phone number.

10:01.100 --> 10:02.600
- We didn't ask you
your phone number.

10:02.600 --> 10:05.399
We asked about
Sherlock Holmes!

10:05.399 --> 10:08.070
- There isn't any memory
technique at all used.

10:08.070 --> 10:09.100
- And there's no book switch?

10:09.100 --> 10:11.070
- And there's no
book switch either.

10:11.070 --> 10:13.169
It's something else
completely different.

10:13.169 --> 10:15.399
- Oh!

10:15.399 --> 10:17.100
Fool on you.

10:17.100 --> 10:19.929
[laughter]

10:19.929 --> 10:21.230
- Bring it down.

10:21.230 --> 10:23.600
Bring the damn thing down.

10:23.600 --> 10:27.029
[cheers and applause]

10:27.029 --> 10:28.029
- Oh, my God.

10:28.029 --> 10:29.830
- And you, sir...

10:29.830 --> 10:32.000
you, sir, will be
on this show again

10:32.000 --> 10:36.169
over my dead body.

10:36.169 --> 10:39.029
Never are you coming
onto this stage again, ever.

10:39.029 --> 10:40.029
We're done with you.

10:40.029 --> 10:42.000
Go back to Canada.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.169
- Yay!

10:43.169 --> 10:45.200
Thank you so much,
seriously.

10:45.200 --> 10:46.870
- Awesome.
- Amazing, man.

10:46.870 --> 10:48.029
- Thank you so much.
- Just so amazing.

10:48.029 --> 10:50.029
- Seriously, thank you.
- So amazing.

10:50.029 --> 10:51.730
- That is so fantastic.

10:51.730 --> 10:53.029
- Yay!

10:53.029 --> 10:55.769
- Two-time fooler!

10:55.769 --> 10:59.230
Shawn Farquhar!

10:59.230 --> 11:01.730
Penn and Teller
have been fooled.

11:01.730 --> 11:04.200
Let's see if it can happen again
when we come back.

11:04.200 --> 11:07.830
- And make sure--make sure
you have four cards

11:07.830 --> 11:10.830
with all different fronts
and the same backs

11:10.830 --> 11:12.169
that you're willing to ruin.

11:12.169 --> 11:14.070
And we'll do a trick for you
in your home

11:14.070 --> 11:15.870
at the end of the show.

11:15.870 --> 11:16.870
[cheers and applause]

11:16.870 --> 11:19.429
â™ª â™ª

11:24.730 --> 11:26.929
[jazz music]

11:26.929 --> 11:28.399
[applause]

11:28.399 --> 11:29.870
- Welcome back.

11:29.870 --> 11:32.669
We've already had one act
fool Penn and Teller.

11:32.669 --> 11:34.029
Do I hear two?

11:34.029 --> 11:36.870
Let's meet our next
potential fooler.

11:40.070 --> 11:41.870
- I'm Michael Kent
from Columbus, Ohio.

11:41.870 --> 11:43.500
I do a standup comedy
magic show.

11:43.500 --> 11:44.870
My show is really
high-energy,

11:44.870 --> 11:46.100
but I'm sort of a smart-ass.

11:46.100 --> 11:47.399
Can I say that?

11:47.399 --> 11:49.000
I think of it as, like,
the magical embodiment

11:49.000 --> 11:50.230
of a smirk.

11:50.230 --> 11:52.500
When I was young,
I was fascinated by magic,

11:52.500 --> 11:55.000
but drumming was my main thing.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.730
I think that learning
to play the drums as a child

11:57.730 --> 11:59.730
has really helped me
learn magic.

11:59.730 --> 12:02.870
You're teaching yourself
how to learn on your own.

12:02.870 --> 12:04.929
I'm performing a trick
with a bottle of alcohol.

12:04.929 --> 12:07.029
I know that Penn and Teller
aren't big drinkers,

12:07.029 --> 12:09.830
so I hope they'll be able
to look past that

12:09.830 --> 12:11.700
and enjoy it nonetheless.

12:11.700 --> 12:14.929
[cheers and applause]

12:14.929 --> 12:19.000
- Please welcome the
comedy magic of Michael Kent.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
[applause]

12:25.100 --> 12:27.169
- Would you like
to see something amazing?

12:27.169 --> 12:28.169
Say, "Yeah."

12:28.169 --> 12:29.029
all: Yeah!

12:29.029 --> 12:30.169
- Oh, good.

12:30.169 --> 12:32.370
This is a thing
with a bottle and a glass.

12:32.370 --> 12:33.529
And the idea is to get
the bottle

12:33.529 --> 12:35.169
and the glass to switch places.

12:35.169 --> 12:38.169
I'm gonna do that using nothing
but these two red tubes.

12:38.169 --> 12:40.200
[laughs]

12:40.200 --> 12:41.029
I can still do it.

12:41.029 --> 12:42.269
It's okay.

12:42.269 --> 12:43.700
Nothing but these
two red tubes.

12:43.700 --> 12:45.029
You cover the bottle,
you cover the glass.

12:45.029 --> 12:49.000
One the count of three--
one, two, three.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.700
Nothing happens.

12:50.700 --> 12:54.529
Unless you're cross-eyed.
That was awesome.

12:54.529 --> 12:56.600
It didn't work because I didn't
say the magic words.

12:56.600 --> 12:58.730
The magic words are "change."

12:58.730 --> 12:59.730
Help me out.

12:59.730 --> 13:00.830
all: Change!

13:00.830 --> 13:01.830
- Louder!

13:01.830 --> 13:02.830
all: Change!

13:02.830 --> 13:03.870
- I feel like Obama.

13:03.870 --> 13:05.399
all: Change!

13:05.399 --> 13:07.100
- Let's see if it worked.

13:07.100 --> 13:09.000
[gasps]

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
The bottle is now here.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.169
[laughs]

13:12.169 --> 13:13.070
The glass is now here.

13:13.070 --> 13:14.899
That's the easy part.

13:14.899 --> 13:19.370
The hard part is getting them
to go back to where they were.

13:19.370 --> 13:21.399
[laughter]

13:21.399 --> 13:23.070
I need different magic words
for that.

13:23.070 --> 13:26.100
Let's say,
"Make them go back."

13:26.100 --> 13:28.600
all: Make them go back!

13:28.600 --> 13:32.000
- Let's see if it worked.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
What?

13:33.000 --> 13:36.029
You did it.
You did it.

13:36.029 --> 13:38.330
Sometimes I can actually
do this.

13:38.330 --> 13:40.000
[audience reacts]

13:40.000 --> 13:42.169
- I love that sound.

13:42.169 --> 13:43.230
Let's do it again.

13:43.230 --> 13:46.169
Remember, tube number one
covers the bottle.

13:46.169 --> 13:48.070
Tube number--
oh, sorry, my bad.

13:48.070 --> 13:49.070
Sorry, sorry.

13:49.070 --> 13:50.200
Tube number two
covers the glass.

13:50.200 --> 13:51.330
That's a bottle,
that's a glass.

13:51.330 --> 13:53.000
We'll do it again,
we'll do it again.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.230
Tube number one
covers the bottle.

13:54.230 --> 13:57.200
Tube number two--
sorry, sorry.

13:57.200 --> 13:58.399
Tube number two
covers the glass.

13:58.399 --> 13:59.830
That's a bottle,
that's a glass.

13:59.830 --> 14:01.669
We'll do it one more time,
using only one tube.

14:01.669 --> 14:03.169
If you cover the glass,
that becomes a bottle.

14:03.169 --> 14:04.200
If you cover the bottle,
that becomes a glass.

14:04.200 --> 14:05.669
That means an extra bottle.

14:05.669 --> 14:07.169
You put it right here.
You don't let people see it.

14:07.169 --> 14:08.200
If you cover the glass,
that becomes a bottle.

14:08.200 --> 14:09.669
If you cover the bottle,
that becomes a glass.

14:09.669 --> 14:11.029
That means an extra bottle.

14:11.029 --> 14:12.169
That means you got to
put it away.

14:12.169 --> 14:13.429
Sometimes when I do this,
I don't use any glasses.

14:13.429 --> 14:14.669
If you don't use any glasses,

14:14.669 --> 14:15.899
of course,
you need to use two bottles.

14:15.899 --> 14:17.029
We need an extra bottle.
I don't know why,

14:17.029 --> 14:18.029
but it fits with the theme
of what I'm doing here.

14:18.029 --> 14:19.370
There's another one here.

14:19.370 --> 14:20.600
But if there's one here,
there's one here.

14:20.600 --> 14:21.929
There's one here,
there's one here.

14:21.929 --> 14:23.070
There's one here,
there's a glass here.

14:23.070 --> 14:24.070
There's a bottle here,
there's a bottle there.

14:24.070 --> 14:25.769
And that's the trick!

14:25.769 --> 14:28.769
- Michael Kent!

14:28.769 --> 14:30.600
Whoo!

14:30.600 --> 14:33.269
That's fantastic.

14:33.269 --> 14:36.200
Wow.

14:36.200 --> 14:38.029
Will you come shopping
with me?

14:38.029 --> 14:39.070
- Yeah, seriously.

14:39.070 --> 14:40.830
- It would make it
so much easier.

14:40.830 --> 14:42.429
- I was very popular
in college, that's...

14:42.429 --> 14:45.169
- I would say so.

14:45.169 --> 14:47.169
Now, you told me
a story backstage

14:47.169 --> 14:48.830
about when you
were doing a trick

14:48.830 --> 14:52.200
and somebody wasn't
a very good audience member.

14:52.200 --> 14:54.000
- The strangest thing
that ever happened to me.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
- Yeah.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.070
- Yeah, I was--

14:56.070 --> 14:58.070
I was bitten.

14:58.070 --> 15:00.370
- Mm-hmm, and it was
not a child, people.

15:00.370 --> 15:02.769
- No, it was a grown
human woman person.

15:02.769 --> 15:05.100
The woman really wanted to see
the coin that was in my hand,

15:05.100 --> 15:06.570
and it wasn't time for that.

15:06.570 --> 15:09.200
And so I pulled the hand
behind my back.

15:09.200 --> 15:11.070
The next thing I felt,
she ran around me

15:11.070 --> 15:13.429
and bit my hand.

15:13.429 --> 15:14.500
- So weird.

15:14.500 --> 15:16.529
- Have you ever
been bitten acting?

15:16.529 --> 15:20.070
- Well, I was on a show called
"Buffy the Vampire Slayer."

15:20.070 --> 15:21.669
[cheers and applause]

15:21.669 --> 15:25.429
But...you know.
It was scripted.

15:25.429 --> 15:27.669
- That makes sense.
- And I think I did some biting.

15:27.669 --> 15:29.200
So it was all rehearsed.
It was good.

15:29.200 --> 15:30.169
- Everything was even.

15:30.169 --> 15:31.830
- On a happier note,

15:31.830 --> 15:35.669
what's your dream,
you know, sort of venue?

15:35.669 --> 15:37.200
- Being live on stage

15:37.200 --> 15:40.269
at the Rio All-Suites
Hotel and Casino...

15:40.269 --> 15:41.529
- In front of
Penn and Teller.

15:41.529 --> 15:42.830
- In front of
Penn and Teller.

15:42.830 --> 15:43.830
- Good answer.

15:43.830 --> 15:45.399
- Yeah.

15:45.399 --> 15:48.000
- Well, then, let's not make
you wait any longer.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.169
Let's go to your heroes.

15:49.169 --> 15:50.169
- Okay, sure.

15:50.169 --> 15:52.600
- Penn, Teller.

15:52.600 --> 15:54.029
- Well, you know, this is--

15:54.029 --> 15:56.899
this is a take on a classic

15:56.899 --> 15:59.269
from the 19th century
called Passe Passe Bottles.

15:59.269 --> 16:01.669
Although, he's doing
a later version of that.

16:01.669 --> 16:04.870
But I want to really address
something important here,

16:04.870 --> 16:08.269
which is, there's this view
that laypeople have,

16:08.269 --> 16:10.269
and I think even
some magicians have,

16:10.269 --> 16:14.500
that real technical skill,
sleight of hand skill,

16:14.500 --> 16:17.399
is cards or coins,
small stuff you manipulate,

16:17.399 --> 16:19.529
and you can palm,
and you can do all this.

16:19.529 --> 16:22.529
With apparatus magic,
they often think

16:22.529 --> 16:25.070
that the props
are doing the trick.

16:25.070 --> 16:28.100
I want people to know
how hard this is to do.

16:28.100 --> 16:30.429
It's a really hard thing
to handle.

16:30.429 --> 16:34.700
The speed that you do that,
the clarity, the cleanness,

16:34.700 --> 16:36.570
not only of your--
obviously you're funny.

16:36.570 --> 16:37.769
But everybody knows that.

16:37.769 --> 16:39.200
And obviously
you're likeable.

16:39.200 --> 16:40.370
Everybody knows that.

16:40.370 --> 16:43.029
What they may not know is,
just handling those props.

16:43.029 --> 16:45.429
If you told somebody,
here are the props,

16:45.429 --> 16:47.730
here's how it's done,
here are the secrets,

16:47.730 --> 16:50.200
they would still
stumble through it for months.

16:50.200 --> 16:52.899
And you just have
a beautiful presentation.

16:52.899 --> 16:55.070
You not only have bottles,
you have too many bottles.

16:55.070 --> 16:57.399
And, you know,
I can see the label from here.

16:57.399 --> 16:59.330
It's from
the Brooke Winery, isn't it?

16:59.330 --> 17:00.769
- No, it's...

17:00.769 --> 17:02.529
- Ken Brooke made all that wine.

17:02.529 --> 17:04.900
- Yeah, yeah, I think
Ken Brooke did make

17:04.900 --> 17:06.529
some of the wine, yes.
Yeah, he does--yeah.

17:06.529 --> 17:08.069
- But it's a great routine.

17:08.069 --> 17:09.098
- Thank you very much.

17:09.098 --> 17:10.170
I appreciate that.

17:10.170 --> 17:12.200
- Okay, so are you convinced
they know

17:12.200 --> 17:16.329
how you did everything
and that you didn't fool them?

17:16.329 --> 17:17.598
- I did not fool
Penn and Teller.

17:17.598 --> 17:20.000
- Oh, well,
you certainly impressed them,

17:20.000 --> 17:21.098
and us as well.

17:21.098 --> 17:22.598
- Thank you, I appreciate it.
- Thank you so much.

17:22.598 --> 17:25.730
Michael Kent,
ladies and gentlemen.

17:25.730 --> 17:27.098
Thank you.

17:27.098 --> 17:29.329
[cheers and applause]

17:29.329 --> 17:30.430
We're gonna take a break,

17:30.430 --> 17:32.529
but we'll be right back
with more magic,

17:32.529 --> 17:36.500
including a performance by
the legendary Penn and Teller.

17:36.500 --> 17:38.230
Stay close.

17:38.230 --> 17:41.230
[cheers and applause]

17:53.529 --> 17:55.069
- Thanks for sticking around.

17:55.069 --> 17:58.069
As a thank you,
I give you our next magician.

18:00.869 --> 18:02.430
- I'm Nathan Burton.

18:02.430 --> 18:03.569
Since I was a little kid,

18:03.569 --> 18:05.930
I knew I wanted
to be a magician.

18:05.930 --> 18:07.069
If you're a magician,

18:07.069 --> 18:12.000
Las Vegas is the magic mecca
of the world.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.069
I'm very lucky
that it's a family business.

18:14.069 --> 18:15.930
I have my mom,
who's in charge of accounting.

18:15.930 --> 18:17.200
I got my sister,

18:17.200 --> 18:18.769
who's in charge
of the lighting, the sound.

18:18.769 --> 18:20.230
My wife's in charge
of the showgirls,

18:20.230 --> 18:21.900
the choreography,
the costumes.

18:21.900 --> 18:24.069
And I actually have
my son in the show.

18:24.069 --> 18:26.730
He's in charge
of being a baby.

18:26.730 --> 18:30.599
My style is, I come out,
I hit them hard.

18:30.599 --> 18:32.170
I do some big stuff.

18:32.170 --> 18:34.670
I make four showgirls
appear out of an empty box,

18:34.670 --> 18:36.769
the very first thing
in my show.

18:36.769 --> 18:39.930
Penn and Teller, we're bringing
some big illusions,

18:39.930 --> 18:41.700
bringing a couple showgirls.

18:41.700 --> 18:43.769
And we might just fool you.

18:43.769 --> 18:47.200
[cheers and applause]

18:47.200 --> 18:50.730
- Please welcome Nathan Burton.

18:50.730 --> 18:52.529
- Thank you very much.

18:52.529 --> 18:54.200
Wow, thank you very much.

18:54.200 --> 18:56.200
Well, it's a pleasure
to be here.

18:56.200 --> 18:57.670
And I got to tell you,
growing up as a kid,

18:57.670 --> 18:59.500
I got in all kinds
of trouble growing up.

18:59.500 --> 19:01.529
I remember on a Friday night,
my friends and I,

19:01.529 --> 19:03.500
we'd go to the local
grocery store, go inside.

19:03.500 --> 19:06.029
We'd buy maybe 100 rolls
of toilet paper.

19:06.029 --> 19:08.029
We'd load it up in the cart,
we'd pay for it,

19:08.029 --> 19:10.069
put it in our car,
drive through the neighborhood,

19:10.069 --> 19:11.269
look for our friend's house.

19:11.269 --> 19:14.099
If no one was around,
we'd take all the toilet paper,

19:14.099 --> 19:15.170
throw it up in the trees.

19:15.170 --> 19:17.099
And we used to call it
TP-ing a house.

19:17.099 --> 19:20.000
Well, the problem was,
we couldn't do it fast enough.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.400
So we came up
with a little invention,

19:21.400 --> 19:23.029
and I want to show it
to you guys.

19:23.029 --> 19:24.829
Here we go.

19:24.829 --> 19:27.829
[intense music]

19:27.829 --> 19:35.829
â™ª â™ª

20:10.700 --> 20:12.099
Yes.

20:12.099 --> 20:15.400
Please welcome to the stage
the lovely Stacy.

20:15.400 --> 20:18.400
Everybody say,
"Hi, Stacy."

20:18.400 --> 20:19.700
I have a little
magic marker.

20:19.700 --> 20:21.529
Stacy's gonna come
out to Penn and Teller.

20:21.529 --> 20:22.599
Kind of like a card trick.

20:22.599 --> 20:25.099
I actually need, Penn,
for you to sign Stacy

20:25.099 --> 20:27.500
so we know there's no copies,
there's no twins,

20:27.500 --> 20:28.869
there's no duplicates.
- Oh, my goodness.

20:28.869 --> 20:32.029
- So please sign on her arm,
anything you want.

20:32.029 --> 20:33.099
You can change markers.

20:33.099 --> 20:34.329
You can do whatever you want,

20:34.329 --> 20:35.700
something that you'll recognize

20:35.700 --> 20:39.200
so that you definitely
know it's Stacy.

20:39.200 --> 20:41.099
What is he gonna write?

20:47.000 --> 20:48.829
[applause]

20:48.829 --> 20:50.200
Come on up.

20:50.200 --> 20:52.430
What did he write?

20:52.430 --> 20:54.230
Aw, that's very cool.

20:54.230 --> 20:55.829
Are you guys ready?

20:55.829 --> 20:57.900
Let's do it, come on.

20:57.900 --> 21:01.000
[upbeat funky music]

21:01.000 --> 21:09.000
â™ª â™ª

21:55.930 --> 21:59.900
Penn, please,
verify the signature.

21:59.900 --> 22:01.000
Oh, careful.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.069
Verify, is that--

22:03.069 --> 22:04.369
- Yes.

22:04.369 --> 22:06.000
- Thank you very much.

22:06.000 --> 22:10.099
[cheers and applause]

22:10.099 --> 22:13.670
- Nathan Burton, everybody.
- Good job.

22:13.670 --> 22:15.069
- That was incredible, Nathan.
- Alyson.

22:15.069 --> 22:16.069
Thank you very much.

22:16.069 --> 22:18.069
- Did you--you made all of that?

22:18.069 --> 22:20.869
- Yeah, we make it
in a shop here in town.

22:20.869 --> 22:22.000
- I want to go
to that shop.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.500
- Do you want your own show
in Vegas?

22:23.500 --> 22:25.069
- No, I just want
to make all that stuff

22:25.069 --> 22:27.369
to really impress my friends.

22:27.369 --> 22:29.069
And then your wife
picks out--

22:29.069 --> 22:30.200
- It's a family operation.

22:30.200 --> 22:32.000
We have a little
afternoon show in Vegas,

22:32.000 --> 22:33.170
at Planet Hollywood.

22:33.170 --> 22:34.230
And it's my family.

22:34.230 --> 22:36.869
It's my mom, it's my sister,
it's my wife,

22:36.869 --> 22:38.829
and my brand-new baby boy,
he's one years old.

22:38.829 --> 22:40.730
He comes to the show,
he watches the show.

22:40.730 --> 22:42.170
And I put something new
in the show,

22:42.170 --> 22:43.230
and he doesn't like it.

22:43.230 --> 22:44.730
- Oh.
- He likes the old stuff.

22:44.730 --> 22:46.029
- How can you tell your son
doesn't like something?

22:46.029 --> 22:47.400
- He doesn't watch it.

22:47.400 --> 22:49.200
- Oh, maybe if you, like,
put a teddy bear on it,

22:49.200 --> 22:50.200
he'll like it.

22:50.200 --> 22:51.329
- That's a good idea.
Look at you.

22:51.329 --> 22:53.900
- Yeah, and what were you like
when you were a kid?

22:53.900 --> 22:55.430
- Actually, I had
a learning disability.

22:55.430 --> 22:57.400
They actually gave me
a test in school

22:57.400 --> 22:58.930
to evaluate what kind of career,

22:58.930 --> 23:00.369
what kind of job
you should have,

23:00.369 --> 23:02.430
and the results came back,
and the teacher told me,

23:02.430 --> 23:04.069
you need to pick a job
where you do not speak

23:04.069 --> 23:06.029
in public or in front
of a large group of people.

23:06.029 --> 23:08.170
- Oh, no.
Yeah.

23:08.170 --> 23:09.670
- So I hope she's watching.

23:09.670 --> 23:10.900
- Oh.

23:10.900 --> 23:12.200
Penn, Teller?

23:12.200 --> 23:14.099
- Oh, my goodness,
oh, my goodness, boy.

23:14.099 --> 23:16.599
You know, we all work
in Vegas.

23:16.599 --> 23:19.170
Nathan works in Vegas here
with us.

23:19.170 --> 23:20.200
We know some
of the same people.

23:20.200 --> 23:22.170
So, actually, I know Stacy,

23:22.170 --> 23:23.500
because we travel
the same circuits.

23:23.500 --> 23:25.170
So I know she's not a twin.

23:25.170 --> 23:26.230
And also, I signed her,

23:26.230 --> 23:27.869
which is a good
solution to that

23:27.869 --> 23:31.569
There's something very nifty
about signing people, I think.

23:31.569 --> 23:34.329
We also know--
and I bring this up often,

23:34.329 --> 23:35.829
because it's important--

23:35.829 --> 23:38.029
that there are no trap doors
in that stage that you can use.

23:38.029 --> 23:39.430
We know that.

23:39.430 --> 23:42.500
So you have to do a lot
of clever thinking on this,

23:42.500 --> 23:45.369
and you sure did,
sure did really clever thinking.

23:45.369 --> 23:49.170
And, you know,
because I know Stacy,

23:49.170 --> 23:51.099
you know, and because
Teller knows Stacy--

23:51.099 --> 23:52.869
we've seen her work before,

23:52.869 --> 23:54.900
although not
in any trick like this--

23:54.900 --> 23:57.170
you know, it was very hard
to keep our eyes

23:57.170 --> 23:58.200
moving around the stage.

23:58.200 --> 23:59.599
We kept staring at her.

23:59.599 --> 24:01.099
You know, I really didn't
want Stacy to--

24:01.099 --> 24:02.329
- I was hoping for that.

24:02.329 --> 24:05.170
- I really didn't want Stacy
to notice our stares.

24:05.170 --> 24:06.529
You know, as we were
staring at her,

24:06.529 --> 24:07.769
both of us were,

24:07.769 --> 24:09.400
we didn't want her
to notice the stares,

24:09.400 --> 24:13.170
thought that would have kind of
ruined the trick a little bit.

24:13.170 --> 24:16.829
And as far as the police officer
in the toilet,

24:16.829 --> 24:19.269
your strong political
statement there...

24:19.269 --> 24:21.200
[laughter]

24:21.200 --> 24:22.730
- Hotel security guard.

24:22.730 --> 24:24.599
- Hotel security guard.
- Hotel security guard.

24:24.599 --> 24:26.769
- Oh, sure, sure,
that's okay, then.

24:26.769 --> 24:29.329
We also have a little drawing
on that one, too.

24:29.329 --> 24:31.730
So Teller will come up
and show you that.

24:31.730 --> 24:33.230
And I'll come up
and talk to Alyson

24:33.230 --> 24:34.529
while we're doing that.

24:34.529 --> 24:36.099
- That's okay,
we've talked before.

24:36.099 --> 24:38.069
I can just--
I really like his drawings.

24:38.069 --> 24:40.500
- You know, once when I was
in magic camp...

24:40.500 --> 24:41.569
- Ugh.

24:41.569 --> 24:44.029
[laughter]

24:44.029 --> 24:47.329
[cheers and applause]

24:47.329 --> 24:49.269
- A lot of talking for
someone who doesn't talk.

24:49.269 --> 24:51.500
- A lot of talking for someone
who doesn't talk.

24:51.500 --> 24:53.700
Just a lot of chitter-chatter,
chitter-chatter.

24:53.700 --> 24:54.869
- Did he figure it out?

24:54.869 --> 24:55.930
What's happened?

24:55.930 --> 24:57.230
- These guys are pros.

24:57.230 --> 24:59.730
- That's why they're
on the side of a hotel.

24:59.730 --> 25:01.599
[laughter]

25:01.599 --> 25:03.529
- When we were designing this
just for them,

25:03.529 --> 25:05.700
we knew it was almost gonna be
impossible to fool them,

25:05.700 --> 25:07.170
and they know what's going on.

25:07.170 --> 25:09.900
- All right,
thank you so much.

25:09.900 --> 25:12.769
Ladies and gentlemen,
Nathan Burton.

25:12.769 --> 25:16.829
[cheers and applause]

25:16.829 --> 25:19.400
Don't go anywhere, because
we've got more magic for you.

25:19.400 --> 25:21.099
And remember,
later in the show,

25:21.099 --> 25:24.069
you get to do a trick
with Penn and Teller.

25:24.069 --> 25:27.069
[cheers and applause]

25:38.529 --> 25:39.970
- Welcome back to "Fool Us."

25:39.970 --> 25:41.230
I've got my cards ready.

25:41.230 --> 25:42.700
Do you?

25:42.700 --> 25:44.470
You're gonna need them
if you want to do a trick

25:44.470 --> 25:46.000
with Penn and Teller
later in the show.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.569
Meanwhile, it's time
to meet our next act.

25:51.730 --> 25:52.869
- My name is Nathan Coe Marsh.

25:52.869 --> 25:54.069
I'm from Orlando, Florida.

25:54.069 --> 25:57.200
I'm an entertainer,
and have been for all my life.

25:57.200 --> 25:58.970
Both my parents are artists,

25:58.970 --> 26:00.400
so I grew up in a house

26:00.400 --> 26:03.200
where you really felt
like anything was possible.

26:03.200 --> 26:06.900
I got my start doing magic
in a small local comedy club.

26:06.900 --> 26:08.299
Bunch of drunk people.

26:08.299 --> 26:10.900
And learning to perform
in that environment

26:10.900 --> 26:14.400
made me able to go in front
of really any group anywhere.

26:14.400 --> 26:15.900
The most important element

26:15.900 --> 26:18.799
is sitting right where
my audience would be

26:18.799 --> 26:20.630
and trying to give them
what I would want

26:20.630 --> 26:22.630
if I was sitting there.

26:22.630 --> 26:25.329
The power of magic
is that, when it's done well,

26:25.329 --> 26:26.970
it gives people
such an experience

26:26.970 --> 26:28.069
that they're not used to,

26:28.069 --> 26:29.829
that that mask
that we tend to wear

26:29.829 --> 26:31.369
just kind of falls away
for just a second,

26:31.369 --> 26:33.730
and we're really able
to connect with people.

26:33.730 --> 26:36.470
[rock music]

26:36.470 --> 26:39.829
[cheers and applause]

26:39.829 --> 26:41.329
- Ladies and gentlemen,

26:41.329 --> 26:44.970
please welcome
Nathan Coe Marsh.

26:44.970 --> 26:47.970
[cheers and applause]

26:53.000 --> 26:55.069
- Such a thrill to be here
on "Fool Us,"

26:55.069 --> 26:58.670
where the most famous magicians
you've never heard of

26:58.670 --> 27:01.329
leave the safety
of our parents' basements

27:01.329 --> 27:04.029
for an epic showdown on TV.

27:04.029 --> 27:07.470
In other words,
this is the Hunger Games

27:07.470 --> 27:11.170
for 32-year-old virgins.

27:11.170 --> 27:15.730
And, ladies,
just so you know, I'm 33.

27:15.730 --> 27:17.630
We live in an amazing time.

27:17.630 --> 27:19.200
I can get the answer
to almost any question

27:19.200 --> 27:21.700
by reaching in my pocket,
giving my phone a couple taps.

27:21.700 --> 27:24.000
But imagine technology's
next step:

27:24.000 --> 27:26.299
I want something,
it just appears.

27:26.299 --> 27:28.670
Tonight you're gonna be the
first people to experience this.

27:28.670 --> 27:29.829
You're gonna think of something.

27:29.829 --> 27:33.170
My challenge is to make whatever
it is you can imagine,

27:33.170 --> 27:36.730
bearing in mind
it's a family show, real.

27:36.730 --> 27:40.900
But it must fit
inside this glass jar.

27:40.900 --> 27:43.670
Penn, Teller, if you would
just kind of take a moment,

27:43.670 --> 27:44.829
make sure there's
no way in.

27:44.829 --> 27:46.170
I'll leave it with you
for a few moments.

27:46.170 --> 27:47.700
Make sure there's no way
in or out of the jar.

27:47.700 --> 27:48.829
- Are we allowed to open it?

27:48.829 --> 27:50.000
- Yes, please, absolutely.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
By all means, yeah, make sure
there's nothing in the jar

27:52.000 --> 27:53.829
but the faint aroma
of the Las Vegas strip.

27:53.829 --> 27:55.900
And as they're doing that,
I should emphasize,

27:55.900 --> 27:57.799
no one here is in on this,
nothing's been set up,

27:57.799 --> 28:00.029
so that you guys know that
we're gonna make the process

28:00.029 --> 28:02.900
so random, it's completely
out of my control.

28:02.900 --> 28:05.529
Each of you has a card
and a pencil.

28:05.529 --> 28:07.630
I'd like you to think
of something

28:07.630 --> 28:09.569
that could fit inside our jar.

28:09.569 --> 28:11.799
This could be a grape,
a flower.

28:11.799 --> 28:13.069
Danny DeVito.

28:13.069 --> 28:15.829
If it's small enough
to fit inside our jar,

28:15.829 --> 28:17.799
that'll work for our purposes.

28:17.799 --> 28:18.970
And as they're doing that,

28:18.970 --> 28:20.730
Alyson, perhaps you would
join me for a moment.

28:20.730 --> 28:21.799
- Sure.

28:21.799 --> 28:24.730
- So, we have many hundreds
of possibilities, Alyson,

28:24.730 --> 28:27.299
but we're only gonna need,
like, 20 or 30.

28:27.299 --> 28:29.000
So I'd like you
to take this plate,

28:29.000 --> 28:31.670
and please go out
amongst the people.

28:31.670 --> 28:33.369
Get, like, 20 or 30
of those back.

28:33.369 --> 28:35.329
And I'll ask you back on stage
in just a moment.

28:35.329 --> 28:36.369
- All right.

28:36.369 --> 28:37.400
- And as she's doing that,

28:37.400 --> 28:39.569
Penn, Teller,
how is our jar looking?

28:39.569 --> 28:40.829
- Looks great,
and it smells like--

28:40.829 --> 28:42.000
- Smells good, yeah?

28:42.000 --> 28:43.369
- Smells like root beer barrels.

28:43.369 --> 28:44.569
- Oh, yeah, absolutely.

28:44.569 --> 28:46.569
That's desperation
you're smelling there.

28:46.569 --> 28:48.470
The fragrance of Las Vegas.

28:48.470 --> 28:49.829
And this is our target.

28:49.829 --> 28:51.000
So whatever you guys dream up

28:51.000 --> 28:53.829
will make itself
inside this space.

28:53.829 --> 28:55.069
I won't even touch it.

28:55.069 --> 28:56.799
In fact, we're gonna
leave it isolated

28:56.799 --> 29:03.329
in a series of boxes
about 10 feet off the ground.

29:03.329 --> 29:08.470
So we got a jar inside a box,
inside a box,

29:08.470 --> 29:13.500
just about 17 feet
above the earth.

29:13.500 --> 29:15.799
And it looks like Alyson's
got a fair number.

29:15.799 --> 29:17.130
And, Alyson,
perhaps you'll join me.

29:17.130 --> 29:18.869
The people will show
their love for you.

29:18.869 --> 29:20.130
[applause]

29:20.130 --> 29:21.730
It's a pleasure, welcome.
It's good to see you.

29:21.730 --> 29:23.400
And Alyson, yeah, please, yeah,
just set it down

29:23.400 --> 29:24.900
and step back into my office.

29:24.900 --> 29:27.700
So we have hundreds
of possibilities.

29:27.700 --> 29:29.230
No, you can join,
you can stay.

29:29.230 --> 29:30.700
Can she stay, guys?

29:30.700 --> 29:31.730
[cheers and applause]

29:31.730 --> 29:34.200
She gets to stay.
She gets to stay.

29:34.200 --> 29:36.829
As random as we can be--
and, in fact, Alyson,

29:36.829 --> 29:38.569
yeah, and let's step
into the light, shall we?

29:38.569 --> 29:40.630
And if you would just
kind of turn your head,

29:40.630 --> 29:42.799
reach inside, and grab one
for us, Alyson,

29:42.799 --> 29:44.900
and hold it tightly
against yourself.

29:44.900 --> 29:47.900
Just keep that card
very nice and warm.

29:47.900 --> 29:50.569
And as she's doing that,
let's see what might have been,

29:50.569 --> 29:53.230
because we have a few
different possibilities here.

29:53.230 --> 29:56.369
So we have dice,
we have a dollar bill.

29:56.369 --> 29:58.000
Not terribly ambitious.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
Yahoo.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.869
I'm not sure what that means,
but...

30:00.869 --> 30:02.670
Penn and Teller,
I'd like you guys

30:02.670 --> 30:03.900
to hold on to this as well,

30:03.900 --> 30:05.329
so you make sure there are
many different possibilities.

30:05.329 --> 30:06.829
- Sure, of course.
- Because had her fingers

30:06.829 --> 30:08.730
moved just
a little bit differently,

30:08.730 --> 30:10.529
Alyson would be holding on
to a different card.

30:10.529 --> 30:12.670
And whatever Alyson's
holding on to,

30:12.670 --> 30:16.900
I have to make it real...
in a jar...

30:16.900 --> 30:18.799
25 feet...

30:18.799 --> 30:19.900
[laughter]

30:19.900 --> 30:20.900
above the earth.

30:20.900 --> 30:23.970
And, Alyson, for the first time,
what is our object?

30:23.970 --> 30:26.829
Shall we take a look?

30:26.829 --> 30:28.069
A golf ball.

30:28.069 --> 30:32.400
And now for a meaningless
dramatic gesture.

30:34.700 --> 30:37.529
- Whew.

30:37.529 --> 30:38.700
- It gets better, guys.

30:38.700 --> 30:40.569
It gets better,
it gets better.

30:44.329 --> 30:46.799
[light rattling]

30:50.369 --> 30:52.329
[applause]

30:52.329 --> 30:54.630
Alyson, yeah, hold it up.

30:54.630 --> 30:55.799
Show it to the people.

30:55.799 --> 30:57.069
Show it to the people
for us, Alyson.

30:57.069 --> 31:00.230
In fact, if you would
be so kind,

31:00.230 --> 31:01.970
just kind of take the lid off

31:01.970 --> 31:04.230
and drop the ball
straight into my hand, Alyson.

31:04.230 --> 31:07.470
Just kind of drop that
straight--

31:07.470 --> 31:08.500
Oh, check this out.

31:08.500 --> 31:09.500
Here, take a finger.

31:09.500 --> 31:10.569
Give it a tickle, Alyson.

31:10.569 --> 31:11.569
Give it a tickle.

31:11.569 --> 31:12.730
- A tickle, oh.

31:12.730 --> 31:14.900
- It's a real
solid golf ball, Alyson?

31:14.900 --> 31:16.000
- Yes.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.369
- And it's a real solid
glass jar.

31:17.369 --> 31:19.299
No way in or out of the jar,
except through the top.

31:19.299 --> 31:21.529
But the ball doesn't fit
through the top.

31:21.529 --> 31:22.900
So the only way
this could happen

31:22.900 --> 31:24.630
is if that ball
came into existence

31:24.630 --> 31:27.829
inside the jar.

31:27.829 --> 31:30.829
[cheers and applause]

31:33.170 --> 31:37.299
Penn, Teller, we have a gift
for you gentlemen, as well.

31:37.299 --> 31:39.500
- Thank you so much.

31:39.500 --> 31:40.799
- That is amazing.

31:40.799 --> 31:44.029
Nathan Coe Marsh, everybody.

31:44.029 --> 31:46.700
That's incredible.

31:46.700 --> 31:49.630
That is really amazing.

31:49.630 --> 31:52.000
I just want to go,
"Nuh-uh!"

31:52.000 --> 31:53.829
All right, well, gentlemen,

31:53.829 --> 31:56.000
stop playing
with your balls.

31:56.000 --> 31:57.369
And let's...

31:57.369 --> 31:58.869
Let's talk to...

31:58.869 --> 32:00.000
- Okay, wow.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.470
Okay, there's a...

32:01.470 --> 32:04.529
We don't believe
in the supernatural.

32:04.529 --> 32:06.500
We do not believe
in the supernatural.

32:06.500 --> 32:08.900
We are known for not
believing in the supernatural.

32:08.900 --> 32:12.829
But I think there was some
work of the devil here.

32:12.829 --> 32:14.900
I do think there was
some work of the devil.

32:14.900 --> 32:16.670
- We are acquainted, yes.

32:16.670 --> 32:18.069
- Yes, there was
some work of the devil.

32:18.069 --> 32:19.529
You may have borrowed, actually,

32:19.529 --> 32:21.500
a shirt or a tie
or a handkerchief

32:21.500 --> 32:23.170
from the devil,
as a matter of fact,

32:23.170 --> 32:24.500
in order to be able
to do that.

32:24.500 --> 32:26.130
Now, I was very interested

32:26.130 --> 32:29.569
in the growing height
of that pole.

32:29.569 --> 32:30.670
- Yes.

32:30.670 --> 32:32.000
- You started out saying
it was 10 feet high.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.970
- Yes.
- Then it was 17 feet.

32:33.970 --> 32:35.900
- Yes.
- And then it was 25 feet.

32:35.900 --> 32:38.130
And, yet, it seemed to me

32:38.130 --> 32:40.000
to be getting lower
instead of higher,

32:40.000 --> 32:41.869
because to put that in there,

32:41.869 --> 32:43.299
you needed the chair.

32:43.299 --> 32:44.900
But to get it out,
you just reached up,

32:44.900 --> 32:46.970
because I think part of the pole

32:46.970 --> 32:49.529
fell in a little bit
to Harbin's ditch.

32:49.529 --> 32:51.170
There was a little bit
of a depression there

32:51.170 --> 32:52.230
that fell in there,

32:52.230 --> 32:53.730
that you needed
the chair to get up,

32:53.730 --> 32:54.970
but not to get it down.

32:54.970 --> 32:58.900
So I think it was
all the work of the devil.

32:58.900 --> 33:01.069
- It was, 100%, 100%.

33:01.069 --> 33:03.230
- And the golf ball
in the jar...

33:03.230 --> 33:05.000
I sure hope you can buy
these things.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.670
We don't know
how you did that.

33:07.670 --> 33:08.900
- There is a secret to that.

33:08.900 --> 33:10.670
But you guys got so much
of it, that we're good.

33:10.670 --> 33:11.700
- Okay, thank you.

33:11.700 --> 33:13.130
- Okay, so you agree
that they know

33:13.130 --> 33:14.130
everything there is to know?

33:14.130 --> 33:15.329
- Yes, yes, absolutely.

33:15.329 --> 33:18.200
- Well, thank you,
Nathan Coe Marsh.

33:18.200 --> 33:19.670
Everyone, thank you
for entertaining us so much.

33:19.670 --> 33:21.630
- Thank you, guys.
Thank you, guys.

33:21.630 --> 33:23.130
- Thank you.

33:23.130 --> 33:25.029
[applause]

33:25.029 --> 33:27.470
All right, this is
your last chance.

33:27.470 --> 33:30.529
Go find an old deck of cards
and grab four of them.

33:30.529 --> 33:31.829
When we come back,

33:31.829 --> 33:36.000
you will be performing a card
trick with Penn and Teller.

33:36.000 --> 33:39.000
[cheers and applause]

33:50.970 --> 33:53.970
- Normally, Penn and Teller
perform tricks for you,

33:53.970 --> 33:57.630
but tonight they're going
to perform a trick with you.

33:57.630 --> 34:01.769
Ladies and gentlemen,
Penn and Teller.

34:01.769 --> 34:03.599
- Get yourself four cards,

34:03.599 --> 34:05.569
all different face,
all same backs.

34:05.569 --> 34:07.569
Teller's handing out a few
right down there.

34:07.569 --> 34:11.500
We're gonna do Penn and Teller's
Love Ritual.

34:11.500 --> 34:14.070
If you follow this perfectly,
you will find love.

34:14.070 --> 34:16.130
I don't care
what kind of love you want.

34:16.130 --> 34:18.170
You want romantic love,
we got it for you.

34:18.170 --> 34:20.630
You want familial love,
we'll give it for you.

34:20.630 --> 34:23.599
You want platonic love
for some weird reason,

34:23.599 --> 34:24.400
we'll give you that too.

34:24.400 --> 34:28.130
This will find you love.

34:28.130 --> 34:30.170
Take your four cards,
do this at home.

34:30.170 --> 34:31.469
We don't want to know the order.

34:31.469 --> 34:32.969
We don't even want you
to know the order.

34:32.969 --> 34:34.500
Put them face-down
just like this.

34:34.500 --> 34:36.900
Mix them up a little bit,
just mix them up.

34:36.900 --> 34:39.570
Mix them up so you don't know
what order the cards are in.

34:39.570 --> 34:40.800
That's important.

34:40.800 --> 34:42.670
Now, follow what we're doing
carefully, okay?

34:42.670 --> 34:45.630
Watch Teller or watch me,
but hold them.

34:45.630 --> 34:47.599
Landscape mode,
parallel to the floor,

34:47.599 --> 34:49.469
just like that,
the long way.

34:49.469 --> 34:50.500
Now fold them in half.

34:50.500 --> 34:52.800
You got to weaken your backbone
to find real love.

34:52.800 --> 34:54.570
Fold them in half
just like that.

34:54.570 --> 34:56.730
Fold them perfectly,
and then crease them.

34:56.730 --> 34:58.429
And once you've creased them
like that,

34:58.429 --> 35:01.230
fold them back the other way
and crease them again.

35:01.230 --> 35:02.829
Now, it may look to you
like all you're doing

35:02.829 --> 35:04.570
is weakening the middle
of these cards,

35:04.570 --> 35:06.099
and that is all you're doing.

35:06.099 --> 35:07.570
Keep folding them
back and forth

35:07.570 --> 35:09.329
till they're nice and weak
in the middle.

35:09.329 --> 35:12.130
All four of them,
right together, just like that.

35:12.130 --> 35:14.929
When they're nice and weak,
you take them and you rip them,

35:14.929 --> 35:17.500
as four all together,
right down the middle,

35:17.500 --> 35:18.429
just like that.

35:18.429 --> 35:20.469
You get four half cards
in one hand,

35:20.469 --> 35:22.329
four half cards in the other.

35:22.329 --> 35:24.300
You do not know
the order of them.

35:24.300 --> 35:26.599
We do not care what half
you put on top of the other.

35:26.599 --> 35:29.570
Put one half on top
of the other, just like that.

35:29.570 --> 35:32.269
Now, from now on, we're gonna
call these half cards "cards."

35:32.269 --> 35:33.829
Now, follow
the directions carefully.

35:33.829 --> 35:35.900
We're gonna start out
really easy now, real easy.

35:35.900 --> 35:38.570
Take the top card,
put it on the bottom.

35:38.570 --> 35:39.599
That's easy, right?

35:39.599 --> 35:40.900
You didn't screw that up,
did you?

35:40.900 --> 35:41.900
No, you got that.

35:41.900 --> 35:43.500
Okay, now take
the top two cards.

35:43.500 --> 35:45.900
Take those from the top,
put them on the bottom.

35:45.900 --> 35:47.630
Now it's gonna get
a little more complicated,

35:47.630 --> 35:49.130
brothers and sisters.

35:49.130 --> 35:51.429
Fan them out so you can see
all their backs, just like that.

35:51.429 --> 35:53.829
And take the top three cards.

35:53.829 --> 35:55.300
Be careful.
They stick together.

35:55.300 --> 35:57.269
The top three cards,
just like that.

35:57.269 --> 35:58.730
Do not put them on the bottom!

35:58.730 --> 36:00.599
What are you, crazy?

36:00.599 --> 36:02.000
Those top three cards,

36:02.000 --> 36:04.130
we want to not know what order
they're gonna be in for anybody.

36:04.130 --> 36:05.269
We want to screw that up,

36:05.269 --> 36:07.269
so put them
somewhere in the middle.

36:07.269 --> 36:08.400
You have a couple choices.

36:08.400 --> 36:09.730
Put them somewhere
in the middle.

36:09.730 --> 36:12.230
Everybody's orders are getting
differently, just like that.

36:12.230 --> 36:14.130
They're all getting a little bit
different in the order.

36:14.130 --> 36:15.469
You all put them
in a different place.

36:15.469 --> 36:17.469
But now take that top card,
that top card.

36:17.469 --> 36:18.469
Do not look at it!

36:18.469 --> 36:19.670
What are you, crazy?

36:19.670 --> 36:21.070
Don't look a that top card.

36:21.070 --> 36:22.429
But put it near your heart,

36:22.429 --> 36:24.570
somewhere where it
can feel your heart beat.

36:24.570 --> 36:26.670
Put it right there,
so close to your heart,

36:26.670 --> 36:29.500
so close to your love,
just like that.

36:29.500 --> 36:33.130
Now, okay, now you're gonna take
one, two, or three.

36:33.130 --> 36:34.570
We don't care how many.

36:34.570 --> 36:36.230
One, two, or three cards.

36:36.230 --> 36:37.300
Take them from the top.

36:37.300 --> 36:38.500
One, two, or three.

36:38.500 --> 36:39.900
And put them somewhere
in the middle.

36:39.900 --> 36:41.170
We're just trying
to get everybody

36:41.170 --> 36:42.300
to be a little bit different,

36:42.300 --> 36:46.099
because love is always unique,
just like that.

36:46.099 --> 36:47.230
Now, brothers and sisters,

36:47.230 --> 36:49.130
you can't find love
just inside yourself.

36:49.130 --> 36:50.769
You cannot do it.

36:50.769 --> 36:54.000
Take the top card and exchange
it with somebody else.

36:54.000 --> 36:55.599
Exchange it
with somebody else.

36:55.599 --> 36:58.070
It does not need to be
someone you love.

36:58.070 --> 37:00.230
It can be someone you hate.

37:00.230 --> 37:01.329
[laughter]

37:01.329 --> 37:02.469
- And take that card back.

37:02.469 --> 37:03.469
That card is foreign.

37:03.469 --> 37:05.329
That card doesn't
match any other.

37:05.329 --> 37:07.800
That card doesn't fit in,
but that does not matter,

37:07.800 --> 37:09.469
because love means accepting.

37:09.469 --> 37:11.599
Put that card
somewhere in the middle.

37:11.599 --> 37:15.000
That's all you got to do,
put it somewhere in the middle.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.500
Now, no one's gonna see
what you do here,

37:16.500 --> 37:17.730
so you can be honest.

37:17.730 --> 37:19.570
Take one, two, or three cards.

37:19.570 --> 37:21.469
One, two, or three,
one, two, or three.

37:21.469 --> 37:24.670
One means your love life
has been very, very bad.

37:24.670 --> 37:26.900
Two means your love life
has been pretty good.

37:26.900 --> 37:29.429
And three means your love life
has been spectacular.

37:29.429 --> 37:31.099
No one will see
how many you do.

37:31.099 --> 37:33.599
But take that many cards,
and throw them away.

37:33.599 --> 37:34.599
Get rid of them.

37:34.599 --> 37:35.829
We don't need them at all.

37:35.829 --> 37:36.829
Get rid of them.

37:36.829 --> 37:37.829
Throw them away.

37:37.829 --> 37:41.599
Throw them in the trash can
of bad love.

37:41.599 --> 37:45.469
Now, you know, love takes time
to...fester.

37:45.469 --> 37:47.269
We're gonna take
a symbolic week.

37:47.269 --> 37:48.630
Mike Jones gonna
help me here.

37:48.630 --> 37:50.469
Tear the top card,
call it Monday.

37:50.469 --> 37:51.900
Put it on the bottom.

37:51.900 --> 37:53.469
Next card,
call it Tuesday.

37:53.469 --> 37:54.469
Put it on the bottom.

37:54.469 --> 37:56.099
Next card, call it Wednesday.

37:56.099 --> 37:57.130
Put it on the bottom.

37:57.130 --> 37:58.230
Next card, Thursday.

37:58.230 --> 37:59.400
Put it on the bottom.

37:59.400 --> 38:01.400
Friday,
put it on the bottom.

38:01.400 --> 38:02.769
Saturday,
put it on the bottom.

38:02.769 --> 38:04.570
And Sunday,
put it on the bottom.

38:04.570 --> 38:06.599
Now we all got a different
number of cards.

38:06.599 --> 38:07.599
They're all
in a different order.

38:07.599 --> 38:08.929
You even got a foreign card
in there.

38:08.929 --> 38:11.099
We have no idea
what that order is.

38:11.099 --> 38:12.730
But now we're gonna get
down to one card,

38:12.730 --> 38:14.070
but you have
all different numbers,

38:14.070 --> 38:15.130
all different numbers,

38:15.130 --> 38:17.400
so some of you will stop
earlier than others.

38:17.400 --> 38:19.570
But keep going till you get
down to one card.

38:19.570 --> 38:21.670
Brothers and sisters,
I'm gonna say, "Loves me."

38:21.670 --> 38:24.099
When I say, "Loves me,"
you all say--

38:24.099 --> 38:25.599
No, don't just say.

38:25.599 --> 38:28.170
You scream,
with all the love in your heart,

38:28.170 --> 38:29.969
you scream, "Loves me!"

38:29.969 --> 38:31.500
And take that card
from the top

38:31.500 --> 38:32.500
and put it on the bottom.

38:32.500 --> 38:33.400
That could be the one.

38:33.400 --> 38:34.400
Loves me!

38:34.400 --> 38:35.400
all: Loves me!

38:35.400 --> 38:37.570
- Put that card on the bottom.

38:37.570 --> 38:39.599
Now it gets
a little bit sad.

38:39.599 --> 38:41.500
I'm gonna say, "Loves me not."

38:41.500 --> 38:43.670
When I say, "Loves me not,"
you say back--

38:43.670 --> 38:45.099
or you don't say back.

38:45.099 --> 38:49.000
You scream back, with all
the loneliness in your soul,

38:49.000 --> 38:51.730
you scream back,
"Loves me not,"

38:51.730 --> 38:53.469
and throw that card away.

38:53.469 --> 38:54.500
That's bad love.

38:54.500 --> 38:55.929
Loves me not!

38:55.929 --> 38:57.230
all: Loves me not!

38:57.230 --> 39:00.469
- In the trash it goes.

39:00.469 --> 39:01.599
Loves me!

39:01.599 --> 39:02.599
all: Loves me!

39:02.599 --> 39:04.469
- Put it on the bottom.

39:04.469 --> 39:05.800
Loves me not.

39:05.800 --> 39:07.500
all: Loves me not!

39:07.500 --> 39:09.130
- Throw it away.

39:09.130 --> 39:12.130
[jazzy piano music]

39:12.130 --> 39:16.630
â™ª â™ª

39:16.630 --> 39:19.769
That was Minnesota 1978,
wasn't it?

39:19.769 --> 39:20.829
Loves me!

39:20.829 --> 39:21.829
all: Loves me!

39:21.829 --> 39:23.130
- Put it on the bottom.

39:23.130 --> 39:24.429
Loves me not!

39:24.429 --> 39:25.500
all: Loves me not!

39:25.500 --> 39:28.429
- Swipe left!

39:28.429 --> 39:29.429
Loves me!

39:29.429 --> 39:30.429
all: Loves me!

39:30.429 --> 39:31.469
- Put it on the bottom.

39:31.469 --> 39:32.630
Loves me not!

39:32.630 --> 39:33.929
all: Loves me not!

39:33.929 --> 39:36.630
- Break up by text.

39:36.630 --> 39:37.630
Loves me!

39:37.630 --> 39:38.630
all: Loves me!

39:38.630 --> 39:39.630
- Put it on the bottom.

39:39.630 --> 39:40.670
Loves me not!

39:40.670 --> 39:41.670
all: Loves me not!

39:41.670 --> 39:42.670
- You're all down to one.

39:42.670 --> 39:43.969
Don't look at it!

39:43.969 --> 39:45.800
Do not look at it.

39:45.800 --> 39:47.469
Reach near your heart,
pull out that other card.

39:47.469 --> 39:48.670
Do not look at it.

39:48.670 --> 39:50.130
Do not look at it.

39:50.130 --> 39:51.400
Hold them back-to-back.

39:51.400 --> 39:53.230
In just a moment,
brothers and sisters,

39:53.230 --> 39:55.429
I'm gonna say the word "now."

39:55.429 --> 39:56.929
When I say the word "now,"

39:56.929 --> 39:58.900
you turn those cards over.

39:58.900 --> 40:01.769
If those cards match,
you have found love.

40:01.769 --> 40:05.400
And take it from your heart
and scream to the heavens,

40:05.400 --> 40:09.300
"I found love," and throw
both hands over your head.

40:09.300 --> 40:10.829
Are you ready?

40:10.829 --> 40:12.570
Now!

40:12.570 --> 40:15.929
all: I found love!

40:15.929 --> 40:17.500
- Yes, you did,
brothers and sisters.

40:17.500 --> 40:19.000
You found love, didn't you?

40:19.000 --> 40:21.329
You found love over here,
you found love over there.

40:21.329 --> 40:22.500
We all found love.

40:22.500 --> 40:23.929
You found love,
brothers and sisters.

40:23.929 --> 40:25.269
You found your love.

Mike Jones on piano.

40:26.570 --> 40:29.230
Stop, stop, Jonesy.

40:29.230 --> 40:31.500
I see someone here
didn't find love.

40:31.500 --> 40:33.599
Did your cards not match?

40:33.599 --> 40:34.829
What does that mean?

40:34.829 --> 40:36.429
What does that mean, Jonesy?

40:36.429 --> 40:39.400
- I don't know.

40:39.400 --> 40:42.170
- Huh.

40:42.170 --> 40:44.469
It certainly doesn't mean

40:44.469 --> 40:47.429
you're too stupid
to follow simple directions.

40:47.429 --> 40:50.429
[laughter]

40:52.500 --> 40:53.929
Ooh, I know.

40:53.929 --> 40:58.300
It means you are gonna die
bitter and alone.

40:58.300 --> 40:59.429
That's what it means.

40:59.429 --> 41:00.570
The rest of us found love,
didn't we?

41:00.570 --> 41:02.599
We found love,
brothers and sisters.

41:02.599 --> 41:04.570
We found love.
Keep those cards forever.

41:04.570 --> 41:05.469
Exchange them with someone.

41:05.469 --> 41:08.670
We found love,
we found love, we found love.

We all--

41:10.400 --> 41:16.800
â™ª â™ª

41:16.800 --> 41:20.900
Doesn't necessarily mean...

41:20.900 --> 41:25.829
you're gonna die
bitter and alone.

41:25.829 --> 41:26.929
- Good.

41:26.929 --> 41:28.099
I'm glad.

41:28.099 --> 41:29.329
All right.

41:29.329 --> 41:31.269
Now our night is complete.
