I loved that movie.

00:39.640 --> 00:41.974
All I can say is,
Heil, Heigl.

00:41.976 --> 00:44.109
Offensive to some.

00:44.111 --> 00:45.544
Son, you know
I value

00:45.546 --> 00:46.845
our time together.

00:46.847 --> 00:48.447
As do I, Papar.

00:48.449 --> 00:50.115
Do not...
People are...

00:50.117 --> 00:51.984
I... (groans)

00:51.986 --> 00:54.686
Thank you for asking me to be
your date tonight--

00:54.688 --> 00:58.090
preesh the Dotz--
but perhaps, in the future,

00:58.092 --> 01:00.025
you could invite a young lady
you're sweet on.

01:00.027 --> 01:02.027
Hey, Junior!
(spits)

01:02.029 --> 01:05.464
Ernie Krinklesac,
as I live and breathe.

01:05.466 --> 01:06.765
Junior, Mr. Brown,

01:06.767 --> 01:08.133
this here's my new
girlfriend Sharla.

01:08.135 --> 01:10.636
Sharla Krinklesac.
No relation.

01:10.638 --> 01:11.637
Hopefully!

01:11.639 --> 01:13.005
BOTH:
Hyuk, hyuk, hyuk!

01:13.007 --> 01:14.339
See, Junior?

01:14.341 --> 01:16.308
Your hayseed friend
is with a girl,

01:16.310 --> 01:17.943
and he seems
to be having fun.

01:17.945 --> 01:19.978
Yup. So's our neighbor
Raymond over there

01:19.980 --> 01:21.246
with his new bessie!

01:22.882 --> 01:24.450
(both moaning)

01:27.253 --> 01:29.021
(both moaning)

01:29.023 --> 01:31.824
(moaning)

01:31.826 --> 01:34.393
I'm gonna lick you
down to nothing.

01:40.934 --> 01:42.101
(screams)

01:42.103 --> 01:43.535
Is the candy for me?

01:43.537 --> 01:44.770
No, son,

01:44.772 --> 01:46.939
it's for the girl you're
gonna woo today.

01:46.941 --> 01:48.039
Woo who?

01:48.041 --> 01:50.175
Are you excited or are
you asking which girl

01:50.277 --> 01:52.010
we're gonna woo today?

01:52.012 --> 01:54.713
I'm not sure.
But I'm eating the candy.

01:54.715 --> 01:56.281
Junior, listen to me.

01:56.283 --> 01:58.183
Your friends all
have girlfriends

01:58.185 --> 01:59.985
and you deserve
one, too.

01:59.987 --> 02:03.956
So now you will begin
love lessons from the master.

02:03.958 --> 02:05.023
Mace Windu?!

02:05.025 --> 02:06.992
No, not a Jedi Master.

02:06.994 --> 02:08.627
A love master! Me!

02:08.629 --> 02:11.530
Our first lesson
is down the hall.

02:14.134 --> 02:15.467
You mean Whitney?

02:15.469 --> 02:17.302
She's a nice girl.

02:17.304 --> 02:21.106
No, she's a gazelle,
and you're a panther.

02:21.108 --> 02:22.674
Can I be
the Pink Panther?

02:22.676 --> 02:23.675
No!

02:23.677 --> 02:25.711
Now go ask her
for a date.

02:25.713 --> 02:27.980
But don't be sweet,
cuddly Junior.

02:27.982 --> 02:30.682
Be Mace Windu,
the tough Jedi

02:30.684 --> 02:32.951
who won't take no
for an answer.

02:32.953 --> 02:35.154
Little tip: always mimic
her body language.

02:35.156 --> 02:36.622
It'll put her at ease.

02:36.624 --> 02:37.689
Go!

02:39.125 --> 02:42.227
(lightsaber powering up)

02:44.197 --> 02:45.330
Oh, hi, Junior.

02:45.332 --> 02:46.465
Oh, hi, Whitney.

02:46.467 --> 02:49.268
I want to take you out.
And before you answer,

02:49.270 --> 02:52.004
I should warn you,
my Force is strong.

02:52.006 --> 02:54.139
If you say no,
I'll use my Force on you.

02:54.141 --> 02:56.341
I'll Force you right here
against the lockers.

02:56.343 --> 02:58.443
And you can say no
all you want,

02:58.445 --> 03:00.846
but I'll just keep
Forcing you.

03:00.848 --> 03:03.148
(screams)
(screams)

03:03.150 --> 03:05.217
(hissing sound, Junior screams)

03:06.352 --> 03:08.153
(screaming)

03:08.155 --> 03:10.088
Oh, God,
she pepper-sprayed him.

03:10.090 --> 03:11.323
She maced Windu.

03:11.325 --> 03:13.058
Ba-da-bop-bada-bop!

03:18.031 --> 03:21.333
(hushed):
Junior, What did the girls's
bathroom look like?

03:29.042 --> 03:32.010
Buddy, did you
notice the way

03:32.012 --> 03:33.779
the chubby server-girl
with the moles on

03:33.781 --> 03:35.614
the back of her neck
smiled at you?

03:35.616 --> 03:36.815
Yeah.

03:36.817 --> 03:38.984
Well, you're chubby
and you have a mole

03:38.986 --> 03:40.852
on the back
of your neck.

03:40.854 --> 03:43.255
Actually, that's a Hershey's
Kiss I'm saving for later.

03:43.257 --> 03:44.456
May I have it?

03:44.458 --> 03:45.691
No.

03:45.693 --> 03:47.025
Maybe I could share it
with her.

03:47.027 --> 03:48.293
Well, okay.

03:48.295 --> 03:50.963
Um... do you work here?

03:50.965 --> 03:53.098
No, I'm stealing
the plates.

03:53.100 --> 03:55.133
Oh, I should probably
tell the management.

03:55.135 --> 03:56.301
That was a joke.

03:56.303 --> 03:57.302
Oh.

03:57.304 --> 03:59.104
(laughs nervously)

04:00.373 --> 04:02.107
The people in this booth
left some chips,

04:02.109 --> 04:03.675
if you want to split them
with...

04:03.677 --> 04:06.878
Yes.

04:06.880 --> 04:09.147
I'm gonna step out the way
and let you do your thang.

04:09.149 --> 04:12.117
And see if you can find
out why salsa's free

04:12.119 --> 04:14.987
but you gotta pay
for guacamole.

04:19.325 --> 04:20.592
Wow.
(door opens)

04:20.594 --> 04:22.995
Hello!

04:22.997 --> 04:25.130
(grunting)

04:25.132 --> 04:26.765
A little help, Dad?

04:26.767 --> 04:27.933
(groans)

04:27.935 --> 04:31.003
(grunting)

04:31.005 --> 04:32.003
Thanks.

04:32.005 --> 04:34.506
Normally, that would make me
want to punch the house,

04:34.508 --> 04:37.142
but nothing can
bring me down today.

04:37.144 --> 04:38.310
I'm in love!

04:38.312 --> 04:40.545
<i>Te amo,</i> Cecilia!

04:40.547 --> 04:42.981
Wow, Junior.
Seems like things are getting

04:42.983 --> 04:44.650
serious between you and your

04:44.652 --> 04:47.286
(high mocking voice):
girlfriend, ooh-hoo-hoo!

04:47.288 --> 04:50.088
Yeah. And her family
wants to meet you.

04:50.090 --> 04:51.323
They invited all of us

04:51.325 --> 04:53.125
to their restaurant
for dinner tonight.

04:53.127 --> 04:56.328
(mocking):
Dinner, ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo!

04:59.165 --> 05:01.366
I think there's more food
on this menu

05:01.368 --> 05:03.201
than there is in the kitchen.

05:03.203 --> 05:06.204
And how is a three cheese
enchilada a heart-smart option?

05:06.206 --> 05:08.840
And why am I taller
than all the busboys?

05:08.842 --> 05:10.809
Be quiet and eat
your menu lettuce.

05:10.811 --> 05:13.345
Here she comes.

05:13.347 --> 05:16.148
Hey, Junior.
How you doing?

05:16.150 --> 05:18.483
Fine, thank you.

05:18.485 --> 05:21.019
Well, that was rude.

05:24.090 --> 05:26.525
<i>Mi amor!</i>

05:26.527 --> 05:28.460
(gasps)
But, wha...?

05:28.462 --> 05:31.029
Junior, that fat one'd be

05:31.031 --> 05:32.931
none-too-pleased see you here

05:32.933 --> 05:34.933
talking with this
good-looking one.

05:34.935 --> 05:36.134
Huh?

05:36.136 --> 05:38.103
I think your <i>papi</i>
<i>is being confused.</i>

05:38.105 --> 05:40.272
Señor Brown,
I am Cecilia,

05:40.274 --> 05:42.841
The girl who has
brought you the chips

05:42.843 --> 05:44.509
is my cousin, Flora.

05:44.511 --> 05:47.379
And Flora introduced us.

05:48.948 --> 05:51.917
Am... am I dreaming?!

05:56.122 --> 05:57.923
Nope.

05:57.925 --> 05:59.758
Ah! Salas-eye!

06:05.798 --> 06:07.999
You want me to do the <i>avion?</i>

06:08.001 --> 06:09.167
<i>Por favor.</i>

06:09.169 --> 06:10.936
(mimics airplane engine)

06:10.938 --> 06:14.005
Oh, because it was so hard
to get him to eat before.

06:14.007 --> 06:15.540
So, if you're 16,

06:15.542 --> 06:17.442
how come you don't go
to Stoolbend High?

06:17.444 --> 06:20.045
I came from Mexico
only a few weeks ago.

06:20.047 --> 06:22.314
I work full-time here
at my aunt's restaurant.

06:22.316 --> 06:24.983
But I am hoping
to become a nurse.

06:24.985 --> 06:26.318
A nurse, you say?

06:26.320 --> 06:27.986
What a perfect match.

06:27.988 --> 06:31.523
Junior's future is sure to be
riddled with medical problems.

06:31.525 --> 06:33.859
And I worry.

06:33.861 --> 06:35.127
Hey...!

06:35.129 --> 06:36.995
Junior said you'd be
the best-looking

06:36.997 --> 06:39.498
middle-aged black
couple in the place.

06:39.500 --> 06:40.999
(laughs)

06:41.001 --> 06:43.435
I'm Cecilia's Aunt Choni.
Did you like the food?

06:43.437 --> 06:46.037
It's Mexican food.
It's the same everywhere.

06:46.039 --> 06:48.607
I'm so happy my niece
found Junior.

06:48.609 --> 06:51.810
I want to throw a big fiesta
for the two of them.

06:51.812 --> 06:53.445
That means "nap."

06:53.447 --> 06:55.614
Uh, excuse me?
No, no, no.

06:55.616 --> 06:58.483
It's a big,
traditional Mexican party.

06:58.485 --> 06:59.618
Are you Mexican?

06:59.620 --> 07:01.353
You sound Puerto Rican.

07:01.355 --> 07:03.121
I went to college
in Puerto Rico

07:03.123 --> 07:05.190
and the accent's the
only thing I learned.

07:05.192 --> 07:06.525
Oh.

07:06.527 --> 07:07.959
Ah, you should come!

07:07.961 --> 07:11.363
We have dancing, a piñata,
a drunk man walking around

07:11.365 --> 07:14.032
with a million inflatable toys
tied to a stick.

07:14.034 --> 07:15.767
(laughs)

07:15.769 --> 07:18.303
And plenty of food to
fatten this one up.

07:18.305 --> 07:21.940
(giggles)
Come on, Tía Choni,
no   <i>moleste!</i>

07:26.145 --> 07:27.312
(sighs)
All right, Cleveland,

07:27.314 --> 07:29.414
why'd you dig out
your ol' Smug Suspenders?

07:29.416 --> 07:31.016
Oh, these old things?

07:31.018 --> 07:33.819
Perhaps because I'm feeling
superior today.

07:33.821 --> 07:36.855
In fact,
sock-garter superior.

07:36.857 --> 07:38.657
Hmm?

07:38.659 --> 07:40.692
This should be
a doozy.

07:40.694 --> 07:42.327
The dooziest.

07:42.329 --> 07:44.830
It would seem
my beloved son has become

07:44.832 --> 07:46.932
the object
of a young lady's affections.

07:46.934 --> 07:49.100
What, a blind chick thought
he was a beanbag chair

07:49.102 --> 07:50.702
and sat on his face?

07:50.704 --> 07:51.970
(all laugh)

07:51.972 --> 07:53.104
Tosh-funny!

07:54.006 --> 07:55.774
Hey, Dad.
Got your text.

07:55.776 --> 07:58.276
Here's the cordless sander you
asked me to bring from home.

07:58.278 --> 08:00.145
Oh, thank you.
I need that.

08:00.147 --> 08:01.746
Oh, and while
you're here,

08:01.748 --> 08:04.449
why don't you...
introduce the guys

08:04.451 --> 08:07.919
to your... girlfriend?

08:07.921 --> 08:11.656
I am hearing so much
about all of you.

08:11.658 --> 08:12.991
Don't worry,
all    <i>bueno.</i>

08:12.993 --> 08:15.760
(both chuckle, sigh)

08:15.762 --> 08:17.829
(boinging)

08:18.998 --> 08:20.532
(ooga horn blasts)

08:20.534 --> 08:21.500
There we go.

08:21.502 --> 08:23.635
Okay, all done. Bye-bye.

08:23.637 --> 08:25.804
Oh, and Junior,
put the sander back in

08:25.806 --> 08:26.972
the garage, good boy?

08:26.974 --> 08:30.141
Okay, bye-bye
everybody.

08:30.143 --> 08:31.710
Uh, Cleveland,
I don't mean

08:31.712 --> 08:33.445
to fart on your
French fries,

08:33.447 --> 08:35.780
but you do realize
this makes you look bad.

08:35.782 --> 08:37.015
Come again?

08:37.017 --> 08:38.917
Your son's girlfriend is hotter
than your wife.

08:38.919 --> 08:39.985
He outranked you.

08:39.987 --> 08:41.786
Brody-Jennered your Bruce,
beeotch.

08:41.788 --> 08:43.088
That's unfair!

08:43.090 --> 08:45.023
You're comparing
my 42-year-old wife

08:45.025 --> 08:47.425
to a 16-year-old girl.

08:47.427 --> 08:48.793
Took that into account.

08:48.795 --> 08:50.495
Really good at snapping photos
of chicks

08:50.497 --> 08:51.963
when they're not looking.

08:51.965 --> 08:54.032
Used the smartphone app
to age it up.

08:57.003 --> 08:57.936
Mucho hotter.

08:57.938 --> 08:58.970
Yup.

08:58.972 --> 09:00.372
Your boy has outdone you.

09:00.374 --> 09:03.108
I'm not in competition
with my son.

09:03.110 --> 09:04.976
And how dare you suggest
otherwise?!

09:04.978 --> 09:07.512
It's an ugly thought.
Ugly!

09:07.514 --> 09:10.081
My wife is a beautiful,
mature woman.

09:10.083 --> 09:12.851
Cecilia is just a child.

09:12.853 --> 09:15.086
When she's been
with as many men

09:15.088 --> 09:17.889
as my wife,
then we'll talk!

09:24.997 --> 09:26.565
(both giggle)

09:27.266 --> 09:28.433
(chomping)

09:34.840 --> 09:38.143
Ooh, more cheesy bread!

09:38.145 --> 09:41.212
Hope they brought some

09:42.315 --> 09:45.283
I think we've all had enough
cheesy bread.

09:45.285 --> 09:46.518
What?

09:46.520 --> 09:49.688
Señora Brown, for you
to call and invite me

you and your big husband,

09:53.093 --> 09:55.927

09:55.929 --> 09:57.963

for putting a lot of fears

10:05.973 --> 10:07.505
Not flattering.

Boy, hot in here.

Anyone else want
to remove

their bulky,
clownish jacket?

10:13.046 --> 10:14.212
It is kinda stuffy.

10:14.214 --> 10:15.580
This'll help, too.

12:14.868 --> 12:17.869
Would you say Cecilia
is beautiful or gorgeous?

12:17.871 --> 12:20.138
I said "beautiful,"
Tim said "gorgeous,"

12:20.140 --> 12:22.273

"Whoomp, there it is."

12:22.275 --> 12:25.276

about "Cecilia.

12:25.278 --> 12:27.445

12:27.447 --> 12:28.980
She's not that hot.

12:28.982 --> 12:31.616

12:36.089 --> 12:37.455
Yup.
I do.

12:37.457 --> 12:39.124
Yeah.
It's weird.
Yeah, he's fat.

12:39.126 --> 12:40.325
He's not fat.

12:40.327 --> 12:42.627
But if he was--
which he is--

12:42.629 --> 12:45.530
why would someone like her
be with someone like him?

12:45.532 --> 12:47.932
He's only 14 years old.

12:47.934 --> 12:49.601
And I worry.

12:49.603 --> 12:50.769
She's crazy.

12:52.706 --> 12:54.973
But not all crazy girls are hot.

You're welcome.

15:18.184 --> 15:20.518
Lester, you called immigration?

15:20.520 --> 15:23.621
Yeah, the redneck did it,
plot twist of the century.

15:23.623 --> 15:24.923
Oh, Lester.

15:24.925 --> 15:28.693
Well, Junior always wanted

15:28.695 --> 15:32.697
to be abducted by an alien.

15:34.333 --> 15:35.366
Junior!

15:35.368 --> 15:37.468

16:06.032 --> 16:08.032
Well, that's what's up.

16:08.034 --> 16:09.934
Well, I'm not
entirely convinced

16:09.936 --> 16:11.936
a 14-year-old boy
can get married.

16:11.938 --> 16:14.038
We live in Virginia,
where as long

16:14.040 --> 16:17.041
as two dudes aren't trying to
get married, anything goes.

16:17.043 --> 16:21.012
Well, Cecilia's at our new
apartment, so I gotta bounce.

16:21.014 --> 16:23.915
Apartment?! All right,
end of insanity.

16:23.917 --> 16:27.018
You are forbidden from ever
seeing that girl again.

16:27.020 --> 16:28.786
Cecilia is my wife.

16:28.788 --> 16:30.488
And none of this
would be happening

16:30.490 --> 16:32.824
if you hadn't shot your mouth
off to Mr. Krinklesac

16:32.826 --> 16:35.093
because you didn't believe
a girl like Cecilia

16:35.095 --> 16:36.527
could find me worthwhile.

16:36.529 --> 16:37.929
That's what hurts.

16:37.931 --> 16:40.198
Have a nice life.
Thanks, man.

16:40.200 --> 16:41.366
Wait a minute!

16:41.368 --> 16:43.868
Good luck, buddy.

16:43.870 --> 16:47.071
Oh, man, she gonna
get smushed.

16:52.678 --> 16:56.080
Well, Larry,
tonight's the night.

16:56.082 --> 16:57.749
Can I be honest with you?

16:57.751 --> 16:58.983
I'm scared.

16:58.985 --> 17:00.852
I have no idea
what's going to happen

17:00.854 --> 17:03.087
when Cecilia gets
in this bed with me.

17:03.089 --> 17:06.591
Oh, I wish I hadn't fallen
asleep during <i>Eyes Wide Shut.</i>

17:12.831 --> 17:17.969

17:17.971 --> 17:19.337
(deep romantic voice):
Yeah.

17:24.510 --> 17:26.411
Junior, you are shaking.

17:26.413 --> 17:28.012
What's wrong?

17:28.014 --> 17:29.781
This is my first sleepover.

17:29.783 --> 17:31.749
With a girl?

17:31.751 --> 17:33.151
No. Ever.

17:40.025 --> 17:42.994
Junior, what do you say tonight
I just put on my sweatpants

17:42.996 --> 17:45.029
and make us a tray of brownies?

17:45.031 --> 17:46.597
(deep voice):
Yeah.

<i>Ay, Dios mio.</i>

17:59.913 --> 18:03.014
Hey, Junior, there's a black
couple at table six,

18:03.016 --> 18:05.016
so you know what that means.

18:05.018 --> 18:08.019
No tip.                        )

18:08.021 --> 18:09.620
No, I'm kidding,
it's your parents.

18:09.622 --> 18:11.756
You were right the first time.

18:11.758 --> 18:15.293
Dad, I said I don't want
to talk to you and I meant it.

18:15.295 --> 18:18.629
Now leave the balloons,
which are awesome,
and get out of here.

18:18.631 --> 18:21.165
Son, I wanted
to respect your wishes,

18:21.167 --> 18:24.168
but Cecilia called and asked us
to bring you home.

18:24.170 --> 18:26.037
Ha, ha, ha, Dad.

18:26.039 --> 18:28.806
You're as funny as
a piñata full of bees.

18:28.808 --> 18:31.142
Ha. You imagine
them kids?

18:31.144 --> 18:32.977
"Help! Help!
There's bees!

18:32.979 --> 18:35.847
They're stinging
our arms and such!"

18:35.849 --> 18:38.182
Who would do that to children?

18:38.184 --> 18:39.917
Bad people.

18:39.919 --> 18:41.919
I did call your
parents, Junior.

18:41.921 --> 18:43.921
Wha... <i>por qué, Cecilia?</i>

18:43.923 --> 18:46.457
(gasps)
Are you dumping me?

18:46.459 --> 18:51.696
Ah, kids probably thought it was
a piñata but it was a beehive.

18:51.698 --> 18:55.766
Junior, you are far too sweet
and too young to be married.

18:55.768 --> 18:57.935
We are both too young.

18:57.937 --> 19:01.038
So I'm ending it,
and I may be sent away,

19:01.040 --> 19:03.141
but it's the
right thing to do,

19:03.143 --> 19:05.109
and I'll always remember
what you did for me.

19:05.111 --> 19:06.644
Sorry, son.

19:06.646 --> 19:09.914
None of us wants to see the girl
in trouble, but she's right.

19:09.916 --> 19:11.282
You're 14.

19:11.284 --> 19:13.151
It's time for you
to end this sham.

19:13.153 --> 19:17.021
Sweet burritos
and skeptical papacitos.

19:17.023 --> 19:18.422
Ooh, I like her.

19:18.424 --> 19:20.324
Why is it so hard
for you to believe

19:20.326 --> 19:23.094
that my niece's feelings
for Junior could be real?

19:23.096 --> 19:25.963
Well, I... I mean,
she's... (humming).

19:25.965 --> 19:27.598
And him... mmm.

19:27.600 --> 19:30.368
So you're really going to
look at your own marriage

19:30.370 --> 19:31.969
and tell me that
a beautiful woman

19:31.971 --> 19:33.905
can not be attracted
to a portly lover?

19:35.007 --> 19:37.341
Portly where it counts.

19:37.343 --> 19:41.612
Junior is the kindest,
gentlest soul I have ever known,

19:41.614 --> 19:43.481
next to my own father.

19:44.983 --> 19:46.184
That explains a lot.

19:46.186 --> 19:48.186
Good-bye, Junior.

19:48.188 --> 19:50.121
If things had been different...

19:50.123 --> 19:51.923
if you had been a little older

19:51.925 --> 19:53.925
Wait. Let's stay married.

19:53.927 --> 19:55.993
You'll live with your aunt,
I'll live with my parents.

19:55.995 --> 19:57.662
And a few years from now,

19:57.664 --> 19:59.864
maybe we'll meet up again
and fall in love for real.

19:59.866 --> 20:01.032
Maybe not.

20:01.034 --> 20:03.534
But you won't get deported
unless you cross me.

20:03.536 --> 20:06.871
Junior, you would
do that for me?
Sure.

20:06.873 --> 20:09.440
Lots of married couples don't
sleep in the same bedroom.

20:09.442 --> 20:12.510
Like the Clintons, or Elton
and Olivia Newton John.

20:12.512 --> 20:13.911
Thank you.

20:13.913 --> 20:15.913
You're a true friend.

20:29.161 --> 20:32.830
Dad, I think I want
to have sex with my wife.

20:32.832 --> 20:35.366
Junior, do you
know what sex is?

20:35.368 --> 20:38.035
Well, when two people love
each other very much,

20:38.037 --> 20:42.006
they hug each other
for a long time.
Yeah.

20:42.008 --> 20:47.912
And then once she's good and
warmed up, the man (bleep)...

20:47.914 --> 20:52.683
(bleeping continues)

20:52.685 --> 20:56.520
But that's only if you
have one of those swings.
I need to live more.
