00:40.308 --> 00:42.110
This neighborhood
isn't safe to walk in.

00:42.143 --> 00:42.810
Hop in.

00:42.843 --> 00:45.379
I'll give you a ride.

00:48.882 --> 00:49.817
Get over here.

00:49.850 --> 00:53.454
- Tara No, no!

01:05.233 --> 01:08.136
- Get in there.

01:57.251 --> 01:58.752
- Okay.

02:01.322 --> 02:02.322
- One more time.

02:05.459 --> 02:09.330
- Shale, I noticed you have
some sores in your mouth.

02:10.964 --> 02:11.765
Do they hurt?

02:11.799 --> 02:13.167
- A little.

02:13.201 --> 02:15.803
- How long have they been there?

02:15.836 --> 02:17.305
- I guess, like, a couple weeks.

02:17.338 --> 02:18.739
- I need you to be honest with

02:18.772 --> 02:21.775
me so we can give
you the proper care.

02:21.809 --> 02:22.809
Shale.

02:23.977 --> 02:25.913
Are you sexually active?

02:25.946 --> 02:26.946
- No.

02:28.616 --> 02:31.519
- Have you engaged
in any oral sex?

02:31.552 --> 02:33.321
- I said no.

02:33.354 --> 02:34.922
- I have to ask, okay.

02:36.357 --> 02:37.925
I'll take your pulse.

02:43.264 --> 02:44.508
- Just confirming
Joey's ten o'clock

02:44.532 --> 02:46.200
tomorrow to have a cast removed.

02:46.234 --> 02:48.369
Does that still work?

02:48.402 --> 02:49.237
Great.

02:49.270 --> 02:50.270
Thanks.

02:53.407 --> 02:54.575
Can I help you?

02:55.809 --> 02:57.211
- I'm just waiting for my mom.

02:57.245 --> 02:58.512
Abby.

02:58.546 --> 03:00.214
- You're nurse Abby's daughter.

03:00.248 --> 03:01.515
- Mhm.

03:01.549 --> 03:02.792
- Now tell me, are
you the one that plays

03:02.816 --> 03:06.754
soccer or wants to be
a fashion designer?

03:08.289 --> 03:09.823
Obviously, right?

03:09.857 --> 03:11.292
I'm Nate.

03:11.325 --> 03:12.436
I just started
about two weeks ago.

03:12.460 --> 03:13.994
- I know.

03:14.027 --> 03:15.605
I think you were at lunch
the last time I came in.

03:15.629 --> 03:17.374
- Well, let me let your
mom know that you're here.

03:17.398 --> 03:18.232
- She knows.

03:18.266 --> 03:19.533
I texted her.

03:19.567 --> 03:20.834
- So.

03:20.868 --> 03:23.704
What else are you
into besides fashion?

03:23.737 --> 03:25.606
- Um, I like dogs.

03:25.639 --> 03:27.408
Even though my parents
won't let me get one.

03:27.441 --> 03:29.710
And I don't know, I watch TV.

03:30.744 --> 03:33.614
- What's your favorite TV show?

03:33.647 --> 03:36.950
- Right now it's that
dating show, Single Swap.

03:36.984 --> 03:38.018
- Mine too.

03:38.051 --> 03:39.887
- How is Shale?

03:39.920 --> 03:41.655
- I found some
lesions in her mouth.

03:41.689 --> 03:44.258
It might be an STD.

03:44.292 --> 03:45.702
- I was really hoping to
get through this month

03:45.726 --> 03:47.995
without having to tell
another family that news.

03:48.028 --> 03:49.297
- I know.

03:49.330 --> 03:50.831
I don't envy you.

03:50.864 --> 03:53.033
- No, I don't either.

03:53.066 --> 03:53.934
- Good luck sweetheart.

03:53.967 --> 03:55.869
- Thank you.

03:55.903 --> 03:58.272
- So do you think Greg
actually hooked up with Linda

03:58.306 --> 04:00.508
or did Paul just kinda
start that to make drama?

04:00.541 --> 04:01.651
- I think it was a complete lie.

04:01.675 --> 04:03.377
What do you think?

04:03.411 --> 04:04.378
- I don't know.

04:04.412 --> 04:05.679
I mean, Linda was into Greg

04:05.713 --> 04:07.881
the minute she
arrived at the house.

04:07.915 --> 04:09.483
- That's true.

04:09.517 --> 04:10.751
- Hi sweetie.

04:10.784 --> 04:11.752
How was school?

04:11.785 --> 04:13.053
- Same as usual.

04:13.086 --> 04:14.086
Lame.

04:15.055 --> 04:16.490
- I see you met Nate,

04:16.524 --> 04:18.034
- Yeah, we were actually
just talking about our

04:18.058 --> 04:19.660
favorite reality show.

04:19.692 --> 04:22.496
- Guys, guys, that stuff
is going to rot your brain.

04:22.530 --> 04:24.998
- She's so out of touch.

04:25.032 --> 04:26.676
- Honey, why don't you
go to the break room

04:26.700 --> 04:28.402
and do your homework?

04:28.436 --> 04:30.046
'Cause your dad's going to
be here in about a half hour

04:30.070 --> 04:31.781
to pick you up and take
you to the party store.

04:31.805 --> 04:33.474
- Do I have to?

04:33.507 --> 04:35.509
- No, but look, your sister
really wants your help

04:35.543 --> 04:38.679
picking out stuff for her
party so you kinda need to.

04:38.712 --> 04:39.712
Sorry kiddo.

04:40.781 --> 04:41.615
- Abby!

04:41.649 --> 04:42.916
Hey!

04:42.950 --> 04:44.518
I almost forgot you
actually work here.

04:44.552 --> 04:45.419
- Hey Diane.

04:45.453 --> 04:46.454
Good to see you.

04:46.487 --> 04:48.422
Honey, break room!

04:48.456 --> 04:49.657
- Fine.

04:49.690 --> 04:51.091
- Thank you.

04:51.124 --> 04:52.793
- Is Shale almost done?

04:52.826 --> 04:54.995
My new dining room set's
getting delivered today.

04:55.028 --> 04:56.029
You know how it is,

04:56.063 --> 04:58.999
juggling all the
crazy schedules.

04:59.032 --> 05:00.734
- Dr. Blockman's
actually with her now.

05:00.768 --> 05:02.403
I'll go see how much
longer it'll be.

05:02.436 --> 05:03.070
- You are a lifesaver!

05:03.103 --> 05:04.638
- Yeah, no worries.

05:11.912 --> 05:14.715
Regan Lindstrom.

05:24.625 --> 05:25.493
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

05:25.526 --> 05:26.526
- No way.

05:29.663 --> 05:30.864
Hey, my Dad's here.

05:30.898 --> 05:31.665
Catch you guys later.

05:31.699 --> 05:32.533
- See ya.

05:32.566 --> 05:33.566
K, bye.

05:40.007 --> 05:40.874
- Hey sweetie.

05:40.908 --> 05:41.675
How was school today?

05:41.709 --> 05:42.976
- Great.

05:43.010 --> 05:44.745
Pop quiz in chemistry,
totally nailed it.

05:44.778 --> 05:46.113
- That's my girl.

05:46.146 --> 05:47.491
Ready to go do some
birthday shopping?

05:47.515 --> 05:48.382
- What do you think?

05:48.416 --> 05:49.116
- Let's do it.

05:49.149 --> 05:50.149
Let's do it!

05:59.927 --> 06:00.861
- My god you have to see what

06:00.894 --> 06:02.430
Austin just sent me.

06:02.463 --> 06:04.164
- Austin messaged you?

06:04.197 --> 06:06.099
- You're going to like it.

06:06.133 --> 06:08.001
Just sent it.

06:08.035 --> 06:09.670
It's so hot, right?

06:11.572 --> 06:14.508
- So, are you going
to show him, yours?

06:14.542 --> 06:16.076
- If he's lucky.

06:16.109 --> 06:17.845
I'll just use Gem.

06:17.878 --> 06:21.782
The messages disappear,
so no one will ever know.

06:22.816 --> 06:24.552
My mom has this weird party

06:24.585 --> 06:26.696
charity thing on Friday night
and Shale's throwing a party.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.456
You coming?

06:28.489 --> 06:30.758
- My parents will never let
me if your mom isn't home.

06:30.791 --> 06:31.759
- So?

06:31.792 --> 06:32.792
Lie.

06:35.095 --> 06:36.464
Austin's coming.

06:38.666 --> 06:39.533
- Hey.

06:39.567 --> 06:40.200
Got a minute?

06:40.233 --> 06:41.735
- Sure.

06:41.769 --> 06:43.480
Hey, I gotta go, I'll
talk to you later, okay?

06:43.504 --> 06:45.673
- Peace out, beatch.

06:45.706 --> 06:47.207
- Hey, so I would've
sent this to you

06:47.240 --> 06:48.709
but I don't have your contact.

06:48.742 --> 06:51.011
Here is all the dirt on Greg.

06:52.646 --> 06:54.548
- Where did you find this?

06:54.582 --> 06:55.692
- The show's website posts these

06:55.716 --> 06:57.084
little articles online but they

06:57.117 --> 06:58.986
only keep it on for
a couple of days.

06:59.019 --> 07:00.988
They do 'em for all the
characters on the show.

07:01.021 --> 07:02.222
- That's so cool.

07:02.255 --> 07:03.467
I can't believe I
didn't know about this.

07:03.491 --> 07:04.925
- Yeah, I can send you the link.

07:04.958 --> 07:05.959
- Yeah, here.

07:05.993 --> 07:07.828
I'll give you my e-mail

07:08.996 --> 07:10.097
- Are you on GEM?

07:10.130 --> 07:11.799
'Cause I can text you.

07:11.832 --> 07:13.200
- Yeah, here.

07:13.233 --> 07:16.804
Just type in my name and
I'll accept your invite.

07:16.837 --> 07:18.906
- Okay, found you already.

07:21.509 --> 07:22.876
- N-Dog?

07:22.910 --> 07:24.044
- Yeah, it's my nickname.

07:24.077 --> 07:25.613
Sounds pretty thug, right?

07:25.646 --> 07:29.650
- You're hilarious.

07:30.684 --> 07:31.585
- So, what are you working on?

07:31.619 --> 07:33.987
- Rational equations.

07:34.021 --> 07:35.823
Super boring.

07:35.856 --> 07:37.767
- Well you know, I used to
be pretty good at those.

07:37.791 --> 07:39.993
If you ever need
any help, call me.

07:40.027 --> 07:41.094
- Okay N-Dog.

07:46.600 --> 07:47.868
- Excuse me.

07:47.901 --> 07:48.769
Um, I not really
feeling that well,

07:48.802 --> 07:50.203
can I see a Doctor please.

07:50.237 --> 07:51.204
- Hi, my love!

07:51.238 --> 07:52.238
- Hey.

07:53.807 --> 07:55.876
- So, what's the good news?

07:57.578 --> 07:58.988
- I'm gonna tell you
tonight at dinner.

07:59.012 --> 08:00.514
- Come on!

08:00.548 --> 08:01.181
You promised you'd tell
me when you got here.

08:01.214 --> 08:02.850
- I know, but this way,

08:02.883 --> 08:05.018
I can let the anxiety
grow for a few more hours.

08:05.052 --> 08:06.019
- Unbelievable, you are.

08:06.053 --> 08:07.220
You always do this to me.

08:07.254 --> 08:08.155
- It's what you love
about me though.

08:08.188 --> 08:09.590
- Very true.
- Yeah.

08:09.623 --> 08:09.957
- Okay, Im gonna go grab Regan.

08:09.990 --> 08:10.990
- Okay.

08:13.060 --> 08:14.294
- Hey I'm Nate.

08:14.327 --> 08:16.864
- Nice to meet you, Jim.

08:16.897 --> 08:17.897
Hey Diane.

08:22.803 --> 08:25.105
- So, are you in the
medical field as well?

08:25.138 --> 08:26.774
- No, no.

08:26.807 --> 08:28.785
I'm actually the Youth
Program Director at the YACC.

08:28.809 --> 08:29.677
- Yeah, okay cool.

08:29.710 --> 08:31.044
I know where that is.

08:31.078 --> 08:32.712
So you work with
kids all day too?

08:32.746 --> 08:34.014
Just like your wife?

08:34.047 --> 08:35.082
- Yes.

08:35.115 --> 08:37.017
Yes, we do have that in common.

08:37.049 --> 08:38.628
Plus when one of the kids
gets hurt playing sports

08:38.652 --> 08:42.556
on one of the fields, I can
just send 'em over to her.

08:42.590 --> 08:43.222
There she is.

08:43.256 --> 08:44.124
- Hi Dad.

08:44.157 --> 08:44.992
- Hey, you ready to go?

08:45.025 --> 08:46.126
Taylor's in the car.

08:46.159 --> 08:47.895
- Okay
- Alright sweetie.

08:51.098 --> 08:54.101
- Okay Regan, what
have you been up to?

09:01.942 --> 09:03.186
- So I saw Sabine's
sister coming

09:03.210 --> 09:04.320
out of the doctor's
office today.

09:04.344 --> 09:06.079
- You mean Shale?

09:06.113 --> 09:08.181
She's so annoying.

09:08.215 --> 09:09.883
- No she's not!

09:09.917 --> 09:11.728
- Don't defend her just
because she's Sabine's sister.

09:11.752 --> 09:14.087
I mean, all she cares
about is attention.

09:14.121 --> 09:15.122
- That's not true.

09:15.155 --> 09:16.757
Boys just like her.

09:16.790 --> 09:18.692
- Yeah, because she
barely wears any clothes.

09:18.726 --> 09:21.762
Like, I'm pretty sure she
shops in the toddler section.

09:21.795 --> 09:23.163
- Whatever, Taylor.

09:23.196 --> 09:25.999
You're just too
good for everyone.

09:26.033 --> 09:28.001
- That's enough, ladies.

09:28.035 --> 09:30.037
- She started it by
dissing on Shale.

09:30.070 --> 09:30.971
- Well I'm gonna end it.

09:31.004 --> 09:31.905
Alright, we're going to go on to

09:31.939 --> 09:34.007
a new topic of conversation.

09:45.218 --> 09:46.053
- Hi love.

09:46.086 --> 09:47.120
- Hey!

09:47.154 --> 09:48.154
- Okay.

09:48.989 --> 09:50.891
I'm not waiting any more.

09:50.924 --> 09:51.925
- You wanna hear it now?

09:51.959 --> 09:52.959
Okay, um.

09:54.294 --> 09:55.829
- What's the news?

09:55.863 --> 09:57.898
- Okay, well, okay I can
tell you, sure why not.

09:57.931 --> 10:01.869
Well, the good news is
that you are looking at

10:03.103 --> 10:05.839
the next Senior
Director at the YACC.

10:05.873 --> 10:07.340
- What?

10:07.374 --> 10:08.976
Honey!

10:09.009 --> 10:10.177
That's awesome.

10:10.210 --> 10:11.144
- It's good, right?

10:11.178 --> 10:12.880
You know Darren told me today,

10:12.913 --> 10:14.290
he said that all the other
committee members are on board.

10:14.314 --> 10:16.349
So it's a done deal.

10:16.383 --> 10:17.417
- Honey, you deserve it.

10:17.450 --> 10:18.919
I'm so happy for you.

10:18.952 --> 10:20.163
- Well, it's gonna
be longer hours.

10:20.187 --> 10:22.656
But, a lot better pay so,

10:22.690 --> 10:23.833
I think I'm gonna
finally be able

10:23.857 --> 10:25.134
to take us on the
cruise at the Bahamas.

10:25.158 --> 10:27.027
- Aww honey!

10:27.060 --> 10:28.171
You worked so hard for this.

10:28.195 --> 10:29.663
- Good, right?

10:29.697 --> 10:30.964
- That's amazing!

10:33.767 --> 10:34.735
Okay, what'd you make?

10:34.768 --> 10:36.269
- I made pasta again, yeah!

10:36.303 --> 10:37.303
Again!

10:48.281 --> 10:49.281
- Aww.

10:50.784 --> 10:51.784
So cute!

10:52.419 --> 10:53.419
Thanks.

10:55.455 --> 10:56.824
- You're welcome.

10:56.857 --> 10:58.258
What are you up to?

10:59.793 --> 11:01.328
- There's a party
tomorrow night.

11:01.361 --> 11:03.030
A guy I like is going.

11:03.063 --> 11:04.231
Should I go too?

11:06.199 --> 11:07.100
- Hells yeah.

11:07.134 --> 11:09.169
Why wouldn't you?

11:09.202 --> 11:10.771
- Why wouldn't I?

11:10.804 --> 11:13.106
Because my parents never
let me do anything fun.

11:13.140 --> 11:14.074
No parents home.

11:14.107 --> 11:15.275
I'm not allowed!

11:17.210 --> 11:19.179
- Lie and say you're
going to a movie.

11:19.212 --> 11:20.212
Duh.

11:21.915 --> 11:22.915
- Ha!

11:23.751 --> 11:25.685
I like the way you think!

11:56.850 --> 11:57.484
Hey!

11:57.517 --> 11:58.517
- Hi!

12:00.387 --> 12:01.889
- My god, your
sister is so cool.

12:01.922 --> 12:03.256
Can we please trade?

12:04.892 --> 12:05.759
- My god!

12:05.793 --> 12:07.394
Look who's coming over.

12:08.495 --> 12:10.330
- Hey Sabine.

12:10.363 --> 12:12.199
- I can't believe you came.

12:12.232 --> 12:14.134
- I can't say no to you.

12:14.167 --> 12:17.470
Especially after you
sent me that photo today.

12:17.504 --> 12:19.472
- I'm glad you liked it.

12:19.506 --> 12:21.809
I want to show you my room.

12:21.842 --> 12:23.376
- I'd love to see it.

12:24.511 --> 12:26.746
- We'll be back in a bit.

12:45.565 --> 12:46.565
- Hello.

12:47.434 --> 12:49.202
- So how was the party?

12:49.236 --> 12:50.437
- Lame.

12:50.470 --> 12:52.272
He went for my
best friend Sabine.

12:52.305 --> 12:54.041
- Why?

12:54.074 --> 12:56.944
- Because she sent him
half-naked pictures of herself.

12:56.977 --> 12:59.512
- Well, why don't you do that?

12:59.546 --> 13:03.083
Show Sabine that she's
got some competition.

13:03.116 --> 13:03.917
- I don't know.

13:03.951 --> 13:05.485
Because.

13:05.518 --> 13:07.988
I mean, what if he thinks
I look stupid or something?

13:08.021 --> 13:09.990
- Pictures from a
cute girl like you?

13:10.023 --> 13:11.591
I don't think so.

13:11.624 --> 13:12.459
Trust me.

13:12.492 --> 13:13.861
I'm a guy.

13:15.295 --> 13:16.396
- Hey, I gotta go.

13:16.429 --> 13:17.230
- Fine.

13:17.264 --> 13:18.298
- Bye.

13:18.331 --> 13:19.299
Come in!

13:19.332 --> 13:20.467
- Honey, are you up?

13:20.500 --> 13:21.500
- Yup.

13:24.571 --> 13:25.605
G'morning.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.174
- How ya doing?

13:27.207 --> 13:28.408
- I'm good.

13:28.441 --> 13:30.844
- Look, I know
things have been all

13:30.878 --> 13:33.313
about Taylor lately,
but I want you to know

13:33.346 --> 13:35.115
that I'm going to make
it up to you, okay?

13:35.148 --> 13:35.949
- It's okay, mom.

13:35.983 --> 13:37.217
I get it.

13:37.250 --> 13:38.852
- Do you know how
much I love you?

13:38.886 --> 13:39.886
Do you?

13:42.155 --> 13:43.332
- Get up and get dressed, okay.

13:43.356 --> 13:46.159
I'm gonna make you
an amazing breakfast.

13:46.193 --> 13:47.193
- Okay.

13:48.461 --> 13:49.596
I'm getting up.

13:51.899 --> 13:52.532
- I see you.

13:52.565 --> 13:53.400
Get up.

13:53.433 --> 13:54.433
Come on!

15:14.547 --> 15:17.284
- And then Shale totally
hooked up with Bobby,

15:17.317 --> 15:19.919
and then Martin
got super pissed.

15:21.521 --> 15:22.355
- Hey Regan.

15:22.389 --> 15:23.290
- Hey.

15:23.323 --> 15:24.224
- You get my message?

15:24.257 --> 15:26.226
- Ummm, I don't think so.

15:26.259 --> 15:27.527
What was it?

15:27.560 --> 15:30.130
- I said red was a
good color on you.

15:31.464 --> 15:32.299
Don't worry about it gorgeous.

15:32.332 --> 15:33.233
I'll hit you up later.

15:33.266 --> 15:34.266
- Okay.

15:37.204 --> 15:39.406
- What was that about?

15:39.439 --> 15:41.208
- That.

15:41.241 --> 15:43.419
- That looks like something
you'd wear under gym clothes.

15:43.443 --> 15:44.978
That is so not sexy.

15:45.012 --> 15:45.745
- Well Austin liked it

15:45.778 --> 15:48.181
and that's all that matters.

15:48.215 --> 15:49.392
- Yeah, well good
luck with that.

15:49.416 --> 15:52.185
He has a different
girl every week.

16:13.073 --> 16:14.283
- Sabine's probably
just jealous.

16:14.307 --> 16:16.509
I mean, let me see the picture.

16:16.543 --> 16:19.746
I'll let you know if it's sexy.

16:19.779 --> 16:21.648
- I don't know if I
should show it to you,

16:21.681 --> 16:23.250
- Okay, whatever.

16:23.283 --> 16:24.717
Just trying to help.

16:26.719 --> 16:28.488
- Okay, but be honest.

16:31.758 --> 16:34.294
- I can see what she's saying.

16:34.327 --> 16:37.697
I mean, you look
super hot in it.

16:37.730 --> 16:41.668
But guys like something
more frilly and sexy.

16:42.569 --> 16:44.271
Austin is right though.

16:44.304 --> 16:46.439
You look super good in red.

16:48.075 --> 16:48.775
- Ready sweetheart?

16:48.808 --> 16:49.676
- Okay.

16:49.709 --> 16:50.543
- Bye guys.

16:50.577 --> 16:51.577
- Bye.

17:00.387 --> 17:02.489
- Okay, how bout we
pick out Taylor's gift first

17:02.522 --> 17:04.156
and then look for jeans for you.

17:04.191 --> 17:05.192
- Okay

17:05.224 --> 17:08.595
- Maybe I'll look at the purses.

17:08.627 --> 17:11.397
- Yeah, I'll check
out the skirts.

18:22.369 --> 18:23.736
- Is everything okay in there?

18:23.770 --> 18:25.838
Do you need any other sizes?

18:25.872 --> 18:27.607
- Yeah, no, I'm fine.

18:37.817 --> 18:38.818
- Hey honey, you ready?

18:38.851 --> 18:40.320
- Yup.

18:40.353 --> 18:40.987
- You didn't find
anything that you liked?

18:41.020 --> 18:43.223
- No, I didn't see anything.

18:46.759 --> 18:48.228
- Come on.

18:48.261 --> 18:49.896
Since when do you not
want something new?

18:49.929 --> 18:51.898
- I just want to go home.

18:51.931 --> 18:52.899
- Excuse me, ma'am.

18:52.932 --> 18:54.734
Is this your daughter?

18:56.303 --> 18:57.770
- Yes.

18:57.804 --> 18:59.282
- She was trying something
on in the dressing room

18:59.306 --> 19:02.242
and I found these empty hangers.

19:02.275 --> 19:05.478
- They were in there
when I got in there.

19:07.580 --> 19:09.849
- Did you let her into
the dressing room or?

19:09.882 --> 19:13.820
- Well, no, but I mean,
she was back there.

19:15.622 --> 19:17.533
- How could you possibly
know that those were hers?

19:17.557 --> 19:19.459
- Well because she was
the only one back there

19:19.492 --> 19:22.362
and I cleaned out the dressing
room not that long ago.

19:22.395 --> 19:24.331
- Yeah, and I know my daughter

19:24.364 --> 19:28.268
and I can assure you she
would never steal anything.

19:29.836 --> 19:30.946
- Okay, I'm going to have
to look in that bag, miss.

19:30.970 --> 19:32.605
- How dare you
accuse my daughter!

19:32.639 --> 19:35.742
You will absolutely not
look in her personal things.

19:35.775 --> 19:36.943
You know what, actually,

19:36.976 --> 19:38.445
I'd like to speak
to your manager.

19:38.478 --> 19:39.478
- I'm, ummm.

19:40.380 --> 19:41.348
- You know what?

19:41.381 --> 19:42.381
Forget it.

19:43.616 --> 19:44.484
We're gonna take our
business elsewhere.

19:44.517 --> 19:45.685
Come on, honey.

19:47.487 --> 19:48.487
I'm so sorry.

19:49.889 --> 19:50.889
It's unbelievable!

20:19.952 --> 20:21.288
- Shut up!

20:22.655 --> 20:24.032
I can't believe you sent
this photo to Austin.

20:24.056 --> 20:25.401
Okay, now where did
you get this bra?

20:25.425 --> 20:26.693
It's super cute.

20:27.694 --> 20:29.529
- I stole it.

20:29.562 --> 20:30.963
- My god, no way!

20:32.565 --> 20:34.000
That is so not cool.

20:36.503 --> 20:37.970
- Well, I'm sorry
I wasn't born into

20:38.004 --> 20:40.340
a rich family like you were.

20:52.752 --> 20:53.752
- Yeah.

21:03.930 --> 21:04.964
- She's lying, Mom!

21:04.997 --> 21:06.399
- I am not!

21:06.433 --> 21:07.576
Kara showed me the
pictures today.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.369
Everyone at school
has seen them!

21:09.402 --> 21:11.738
- Regan, honey be honest.

21:11.771 --> 21:13.540
Did you let a boy
take a picture of you

21:13.573 --> 21:14.774
in your bra and panties?

21:14.807 --> 21:16.376
- What?

21:16.409 --> 21:17.076
- No!

21:17.109 --> 21:18.611
- It was a selfie, Mom!

21:18.645 --> 21:19.946
She took it herself!

21:19.979 --> 21:21.381
- Regan, Is that true?

21:21.414 --> 21:23.450
- No, I didn't do
anything wrong!

21:23.483 --> 21:25.518
- Let me see your phone.

21:31.891 --> 21:34.494
- She ruined my party!

21:34.527 --> 21:35.762
- She didn't ruin your party.

21:35.795 --> 21:37.530
We're going to figure
this out, okay honey.

21:37.564 --> 21:38.498
Mom and I need to talk.

21:38.531 --> 21:40.333
Can we have some privacy please?

21:40.367 --> 21:41.701
- I hate her so much!

21:41.734 --> 21:43.636
- Taylor, please!

21:46.739 --> 21:49.041
- Are you kidding me?

21:49.075 --> 21:51.478
Sending half naked
pictures of herself?

21:51.511 --> 21:52.479
She's 14!

21:52.512 --> 21:53.613
- I know.

21:53.646 --> 21:55.915
Honestly, I think it's Sabine.

21:57.517 --> 22:00.086
Between you and I, her sister,

22:00.119 --> 22:03.390
came into the clinic
and she has an STD.

22:04.891 --> 22:06.993
Honey, she's Taylor's age.

22:08.027 --> 22:08.895
- Wow.

22:08.928 --> 22:10.897
- Yeah.

22:10.930 --> 22:13.700
- And Regan is obsessed with
everything that Sabine does.

22:13.733 --> 22:14.733
- Exactly.

22:15.668 --> 22:17.504
But, if we try to separate them,

22:17.537 --> 22:19.105
then you know what'll happen.

22:19.138 --> 22:21.574
They'll just sneak around.

22:21.608 --> 22:23.843
I mean, they're best friends.

22:40.126 --> 22:41.093
- I don't even want
to go in there.

22:41.127 --> 22:42.729
I'm so embarrassed.

22:42.762 --> 22:44.931
- Honey, just ignore
anybody who wants to talk

22:44.964 --> 22:46.633
about the pictures.

22:46.666 --> 22:49.402
Okay, I'll talk to
Kara's mom tonight.

22:49.436 --> 22:50.770
It's gonna be fine.

23:00.480 --> 23:02.114
Regan, phone.

23:02.148 --> 23:02.949
- What?

23:02.982 --> 23:04.517
No!

23:04.551 --> 23:06.719
- Yes, I'm going to hold
on to it for the day.

23:06.753 --> 23:08.054
And you get it back tonight

23:08.087 --> 23:10.089
after we sit down and
go over the new rules.

23:10.122 --> 23:11.057
- New rules?

23:11.090 --> 23:12.625
That's not fair!

23:12.659 --> 23:13.826
- Regan.

23:13.860 --> 23:15.027
Phone.

23:15.061 --> 23:16.763
- I hate you and I hate Dad,

23:16.796 --> 23:18.140
and if you take my
phone, I'll run away

23:18.164 --> 23:21.200
and you'll never see me again.

23:21.233 --> 23:24.837
- Don't ever
threaten to run away.

23:24.871 --> 23:27.474
This was your mistake.

23:27.507 --> 23:29.509
Okay, and your father
and I are going to do

23:29.542 --> 23:32.612
whatever we can to
help you fix it.

23:32.645 --> 23:36.516
We are on your side, but we
are still your parents, okay?

23:36.549 --> 23:40.453
And you are going to live
by our rules, understand?

24:02.809 --> 24:05.177
It looks like she
erased the pictures.

24:05.211 --> 24:06.489
- What about the texts
that she sent out

24:06.513 --> 24:07.980
with the pictures?

24:08.014 --> 24:09.882
- Yeah, those are gone too.

24:09.916 --> 24:10.959
- Why don't you try
checking the laptop?

24:10.983 --> 24:12.519
Maybe she sent
something from there.

24:12.552 --> 24:14.020
- Okay, will do.

24:14.053 --> 24:16.623
And umm, I'll call the counselor
that Rhonda recommended

24:16.656 --> 24:19.191
as soon as she opens, see if
we can get her in their soon.

24:19.225 --> 24:20.527
- Alright.

24:20.560 --> 24:21.604
Tell me what she says, okay?

24:21.628 --> 24:23.029
- Okay, will do.

24:23.062 --> 24:26.032
- Honey, we're gonna
figure this out.

24:27.099 --> 24:28.099
- I hope so.

24:29.301 --> 24:30.301
Okay, bye.

24:36.075 --> 24:37.744
Sexy selfies dot com.

24:42.982 --> 24:46.018
Learn how to take
the best sexy selfie?

24:47.153 --> 24:48.153
Regan.

25:32.164 --> 25:33.164
My god.

25:39.271 --> 25:40.773
Hey, honey.

25:40.807 --> 25:44.243
- Hey, so I just got a
call from the principal.

25:45.745 --> 25:46.889
Regan didn't show
up for school today.

25:46.913 --> 25:47.980
- What?

25:57.156 --> 25:58.024
- Excuse me.

25:58.057 --> 26:00.259
Miss, are you okay?

26:00.292 --> 26:02.161
Is everything alright?

26:02.194 --> 26:03.295
- I don't know.

26:05.131 --> 26:09.068
- Is there anything
you need, I can do or?

26:09.101 --> 26:10.770
- Maybe.

26:10.803 --> 26:12.615
Do you have a phone I could
use to make a call with?

26:12.639 --> 26:14.240
- Yeah, sure, okay.

26:16.676 --> 26:17.944
Here you go.

26:17.977 --> 26:19.411
- Thank you.
- Sure.

26:23.282 --> 26:24.660
- The prescription
should be ready by

26:24.684 --> 26:25.652
the time you get there.

26:25.685 --> 26:26.685
Thank you.

26:31.057 --> 26:31.891
Doctor's office.

26:31.924 --> 26:33.059
This is Nate.

26:33.092 --> 26:35.327
- Nate, it's Regan.

26:35.361 --> 26:38.297
- Hey, now you know
your mom's off today.

26:38.330 --> 26:39.165
- I wasn't calling for her.

26:39.198 --> 26:41.333
I was calling you.

26:41.367 --> 26:44.871
They took my phone but I have
her work number memorized.

26:44.904 --> 26:46.639
- What's going on?

26:46.673 --> 26:47.850
- Everything blew
up with this stupid

26:47.874 --> 26:50.109
picture thing and I ran away.

26:53.713 --> 26:54.781
- Where are you?

26:54.814 --> 26:57.249
- At a park somewhere downtown.

26:57.283 --> 26:58.718
- What's the address?

26:58.751 --> 27:00.319
I'll come pick you up.

27:02.755 --> 27:04.423
- Okay, thanks Diane.

27:04.456 --> 27:08.194
I was just, I was hoping
Regan was with Sabine.

27:10.863 --> 27:12.799
- Has Regan
ever run away before?

27:12.832 --> 27:13.832
- No, no.

27:15.301 --> 27:18.705
Never, but, we took
her phone away because

27:20.172 --> 27:23.109
we found these pictures
of her after half-naked

27:23.142 --> 27:27.046
on her phone that she sent
to this boy from school.

27:28.114 --> 27:29.849
- You're kidding.

27:29.882 --> 27:33.786
- Has Sabine ever done
anything like that before?

27:34.353 --> 27:35.855
- No.

27:35.888 --> 27:36.999
I've talked to my girls
about how doing that

27:37.023 --> 27:38.166
type of thing can ruin
their reputations.

27:38.190 --> 27:40.927
They'd never do
anything like that.

27:46.198 --> 27:48.901
- You sure it wasn't a
problem for you to leave work?

27:48.935 --> 27:52.004
- No, I told Dr. Blockman
I wasn't feeling well.

27:52.038 --> 27:54.306
She got one of the nurses
to cover the phones.

27:54.340 --> 27:56.142
- Okay well, thanks
for picking me up.

27:56.175 --> 27:57.443
I didn't know where else to go.

27:57.476 --> 27:58.778
- Yeah.

27:58.811 --> 28:00.880
You can always count on me.

28:14.426 --> 28:15.394
- My gosh!

28:15.427 --> 28:17.429
This is your house?

28:17.463 --> 28:19.732
It's bigger than Sabine's!

28:19.766 --> 28:21.267
- My parents' place.

28:21.300 --> 28:23.770
I live here and I take care
of it while they're gone.

28:23.803 --> 28:25.037
- Where are they?

28:25.071 --> 28:26.272
- I think Spain.

28:26.305 --> 28:27.306
Maybe Italy.

28:27.339 --> 28:29.508
Somewhere over there.

28:29.541 --> 28:30.541
Come on!

28:33.212 --> 28:34.180
- Wow!

28:34.213 --> 28:35.982
This is so cool.

28:36.015 --> 28:37.259
- Hey, what do
you want to drink?

28:37.283 --> 28:40.119
I got juice, water,
soda, beer, wine.

28:41.220 --> 28:42.454
This is good.

28:43.956 --> 28:45.925
Got some Hard cider.

28:45.958 --> 28:47.927
- What is it?

28:47.960 --> 28:50.429
- It's like apple juice but
with a little alcohol in it.

28:50.462 --> 28:51.462
It's good.

28:56.535 --> 28:57.403
- Yeah.

28:57.436 --> 28:59.138
It is good.

28:59.171 --> 29:00.315
- You know you can't tell
your parents I let you drink?

29:00.339 --> 29:02.308
Or that I brought you here.

29:02.341 --> 29:05.011
Your mom would be pissed,
she'd get me fired.

29:05.044 --> 29:06.946
- I swear I won't say a thing.

29:06.979 --> 29:08.090
Plus, right now, it
feels like you're the

29:08.114 --> 29:10.382
only one I can count on.

29:10.416 --> 29:12.084
- So what do you want to do?

29:12.118 --> 29:14.086
We should do something fun.

29:14.120 --> 29:15.120
- Like what?

29:16.188 --> 29:17.790
- you know how to swim?

29:17.824 --> 29:19.826
- Yeah, but I don't
have a swimsuit.

29:19.859 --> 29:21.060
- It's just the two of us.

29:21.093 --> 29:22.093
Who cares?

29:36.042 --> 29:37.009
What's a matter?

29:37.043 --> 29:39.145
You're not going to come in?

29:41.013 --> 29:41.881
Come on.

29:41.914 --> 29:43.349
What am I, scaring you?

29:43.382 --> 29:44.984
- No, of course not!

29:45.017 --> 29:47.353
- Well, then come swim with me!

30:10.342 --> 30:11.610
That wasn't so bad, was it?

30:11.643 --> 30:13.145
- No.

30:13.179 --> 30:15.014
- This is so much
better than work.

30:15.047 --> 30:16.182
- Or school.

30:16.215 --> 30:17.215
- Or school.

30:18.217 --> 30:19.217
- Hey!

30:25.124 --> 30:27.927
- So you
saw her enter the school? hool?

30:27.960 --> 30:31.297
- She must've left right
after I drove away.

30:33.032 --> 30:36.368
I went to the principal's office
as soon as I got the call.

30:37.003 --> 30:37.603
Hey.

30:37.636 --> 30:38.636
- Hey.

30:42.574 --> 30:43.976
How bad is this?

30:45.244 --> 30:47.279
- I don't mean to alarm you or

30:47.313 --> 30:49.348
suggest that she's
been abducted.

30:49.381 --> 30:50.616
- Abducted?

30:50.649 --> 30:52.484
- We're not going
to take any chances.

30:52.518 --> 30:54.586
I'm going to issue
an Amber alert.

30:54.620 --> 30:57.256
If you hear from her
or she returns home,

30:57.289 --> 30:59.491
you let me know immediately.

31:09.335 --> 31:10.536
- Thanks for the ride.

31:10.569 --> 31:12.471
And for hanging
out with me today.

31:12.504 --> 31:15.674
- Yeah, I was happy to do it.

31:15.707 --> 31:19.645
- Umm, can I say
something weird right now?

31:20.279 --> 31:21.279
- Sure.

31:22.614 --> 31:24.951
- Do you think I'm pretty?

31:24.984 --> 31:26.285
- That's a dumb question.

31:26.318 --> 31:28.254
You're beautiful.

31:28.287 --> 31:30.622
Look, Austin's an idiot
for sending those pictures.

31:30.656 --> 31:32.091
He should've treated you right.

31:32.124 --> 31:34.460
He could've been your boyfriend.

31:34.493 --> 31:37.096
Why'd you ask me that?

31:37.129 --> 31:41.067
- 'cause, I thought
you were going to kiss me

31:42.368 --> 31:43.970
today in the pool
but you didn't.

31:45.504 --> 31:46.939
- I wanted to.

31:46.973 --> 31:47.973
Believe me.

31:49.308 --> 31:52.278
I just wasn't sure if
that's what you wanted.

31:54.080 --> 31:57.516
- Tell you what, next
time, I'll kiss you,

31:57.549 --> 32:01.420
and it'll give us both
something to look forward to.

32:01.453 --> 32:02.453
- Deal.

32:03.655 --> 32:06.225
- Come by the office
tomorrow if you can.

32:06.258 --> 32:07.593
- Okay, I will.

32:07.626 --> 32:08.626
Bye.

32:24.076 --> 32:25.444
- Where have you been all day?

32:25.477 --> 32:26.754
- I was hanging
out with a friend.

32:26.778 --> 32:28.347
- Who?

32:28.380 --> 32:30.249
- You don't know him, why?

32:30.282 --> 32:32.651
- Well my mom texted me asking
if I knew where you were.

32:32.684 --> 32:34.320
Your mom called her.

32:37.389 --> 32:39.058
- She knows I ditched?

32:39.091 --> 32:40.635
- Yeah, I think I
just saw her coming out of

32:40.659 --> 32:43.529
Principal Roberts' office too.

32:43.562 --> 32:44.562
- God.

32:46.232 --> 32:49.101
- I think you're
in serious trouble.

32:53.405 --> 32:56.575
- Do you understand the
problems you've created?

32:56.608 --> 32:58.577
They issued an
Amber alert for you!

32:58.610 --> 33:01.113
- It's not my fault
you guys over-reacted!

33:01.147 --> 33:03.515
People skip school all the time.

33:03.549 --> 33:04.616
I never do it!

33:06.418 --> 33:09.455
But the one time I ditch,
you guys call in the Marines!

33:09.488 --> 33:10.522
- Um mhm.

33:10.556 --> 33:12.724
This is not our fault.

33:12.758 --> 33:16.162
You need to take responsibility
for what happened today.

33:16.195 --> 33:19.131
- What's going on with you?

33:19.165 --> 33:20.199
This behavior?

33:21.467 --> 33:22.634
Skipping school,

33:24.170 --> 33:26.105
shoplifting,

33:26.138 --> 33:29.741
sending half-naked pictures
of yourself to boys?

33:31.343 --> 33:33.712
What is happening here?

33:33.745 --> 33:35.647
I need you to explain it to me.

33:35.681 --> 33:37.616
- There's nothing
to explain, okay!

33:37.649 --> 33:39.251
The pictures were a mistake.

33:39.285 --> 33:40.428
I didn't think
Austin was going to

33:40.452 --> 33:42.521
show them around the school.

33:42.554 --> 33:46.125
I'm never talking
to him again, okay.

33:46.158 --> 33:47.559
I didn't shoplift.

33:47.593 --> 33:49.061
Sabine bought them for me.

33:49.095 --> 33:50.596
Call her up and ask!

33:53.132 --> 33:55.467
- Where were you today?

33:55.501 --> 33:57.369
- Answer your mother, Regan.

33:57.403 --> 33:58.737
- I told you already.

33:58.770 --> 33:59.738
At the park.

33:59.771 --> 34:00.771
By myself.

34:02.174 --> 34:03.609
- Did anyone see you there?

34:03.642 --> 34:05.144
- No!

34:05.177 --> 34:06.488
Some lady with her kids
for a little while.

34:06.512 --> 34:07.646
I don't know her.

34:07.679 --> 34:08.480
What is this?

34:08.514 --> 34:10.181
Law & Order?

34:10.216 --> 34:13.719
- When you lie, we have
trouble believing you.

34:13.752 --> 34:15.087
- I'm not lying!

34:15.121 --> 34:16.522
I was alone all day!

34:20.259 --> 34:24.163
- We're gonna be making some
changes starting tomorrow.

34:25.431 --> 34:26.608
We're gonna put a
computer in the kitchen

34:26.632 --> 34:29.235
and you can do your
homework down here.

34:29.268 --> 34:31.737
You can have your phone back
but at the end of each day,

34:31.770 --> 34:34.139
your father or I will
check your e-mails,

34:34.172 --> 34:35.706
your texts, your pictures.

34:35.741 --> 34:37.576
And if you erase anything,

34:37.609 --> 34:40.346
then you don't get
your phone back.

34:41.380 --> 34:42.313
- Are you kidding me?

34:42.348 --> 34:44.416
That's not fair!

34:44.449 --> 34:45.460
- Well this is how
it's going to be

34:45.484 --> 34:47.553
until we can trust you again.

34:47.585 --> 34:49.155
- What about Taylor?

34:49.188 --> 34:52.123
Is she gonna have to do
homework down here too?

34:52.158 --> 34:55.226
- Taylor didn't skip school.

34:55.261 --> 34:57.396
- This is so unfair!

34:57.429 --> 34:59.831
- Lastly, we made
you an appointment

34:59.865 --> 35:01.533
for you with a counselor.

35:01.567 --> 35:02.768
You'll go there once a week

35:02.801 --> 35:06.138
until she feels like
you're back on track.

35:06.172 --> 35:07.773
- How could you do this to me?

35:07.806 --> 35:09.408
You never get mad at Taylor.

35:09.441 --> 35:10.642
You never treat her like this!

35:10.676 --> 35:11.676
Only me!

35:12.544 --> 35:14.480
I can't do anything right!

35:27.326 --> 35:28.494
- Hey.

35:28.527 --> 35:29.527
- Go away.

35:30.462 --> 35:32.731
- I just want to talk to you.

35:34.933 --> 35:36.668
Why'd you ditch today?

35:38.270 --> 35:40.706
Are people bugging you
about those pictures?

35:40.739 --> 35:43.409
- I just hate everyone.

35:43.442 --> 35:44.576
My life sucks.

35:47.446 --> 35:49.515
- Now why do you say that?

35:55.787 --> 35:59.325
- Sabine gets new
stuff all the time.

35:59.358 --> 36:00.759
Everyone likes her.

36:00.792 --> 36:04.463
She has cool parties,
it's not fair.

36:04.496 --> 36:05.773
And then I finally get something

36:05.797 --> 36:08.700
that she doesn't have, Austin,

36:08.734 --> 36:11.903
and he completely betrays me
by sending my pictures around.

36:11.937 --> 36:13.805
Sabine sent him pics too!

36:13.839 --> 36:17.175
Yeah, but he didn't
show those to anyone.

36:19.010 --> 36:22.881
So now it looks like I'm a
total slut and she did it first.

36:24.316 --> 36:25.917
- Listen, I know
she's your bae but,

36:25.951 --> 36:28.854
she's really isn't
that nice to you.

36:28.887 --> 36:32.691
I've seen her put you
down like althe time.

36:32.724 --> 36:36.695
- Then Mom and Dad
completely flipped out on me.

36:36.728 --> 36:39.465
You skip all the time and
they don't do anything.

36:39.498 --> 36:41.400
- Yeah, but I've only
done it a couple times

36:41.433 --> 36:43.569
and never for the entire day.

36:43.602 --> 36:45.404
What were you thinking?

36:46.938 --> 36:49.608
Is that true though that
you told mom you were

36:49.641 --> 36:52.311
going to run away before
you got out of the car?

36:52.344 --> 36:53.779
I mean, I not judging you,

36:53.812 --> 36:56.982
but I think you played
that wrong, just a little!

36:57.015 --> 36:58.015
- Yeah.

37:00.952 --> 37:01.952
I'm an idiot.

37:03.289 --> 37:04.823
- You're not an idiot.

37:04.856 --> 37:07.693
You're pretty and smart
and you're just making

37:07.726 --> 37:09.661
some bad decisions right now.

37:09.695 --> 37:11.330
So, pump the brakes.

37:17.068 --> 37:20.539
- I'm sorry people are
ditching on your party.

37:20.572 --> 37:22.274
- It's all right.

37:22.308 --> 37:24.319
I mean it's only really two
people who aren't going,

37:24.343 --> 37:27.313
and I never really
liked them anyway!

37:28.780 --> 37:29.780
- Hey Tay?

37:33.952 --> 37:37.356
Why do you think I'm
not popular like you?

37:39.325 --> 37:42.794
- I think you try too
hard to act like Sabine.

37:45.764 --> 37:48.634
You'd be popular if you
just acted like you.

37:48.667 --> 37:51.337
You don't have to
impress people.

37:52.371 --> 37:53.905
Who you are is enough.

37:58.677 --> 38:00.312
- G'night.

38:00.346 --> 38:02.481
- 'Night, sista.

38:02.514 --> 38:04.316
Don't stay up too late.

38:18.830 --> 38:19.798
- Hi.

38:19.831 --> 38:20.966
- Hey you.

38:20.999 --> 38:22.634
I got you something,

38:25.871 --> 38:26.772
- Aww.

38:26.805 --> 38:27.839
Thank you!

38:27.873 --> 38:30.409
- Yeah, it reminded me of you.

38:30.442 --> 38:31.442
- I love it.

38:32.944 --> 38:36.014
- Hey I was thinking,
I'm off on Friday.

38:37.516 --> 38:40.552
Can you ditch and
come over again.

38:40.586 --> 38:41.987
- I can't.

38:42.020 --> 38:44.723
I have to chill on ditching
school for a while.

38:44.756 --> 38:45.724
- That sucks.

38:45.757 --> 38:47.092
- Yeah.

38:47.125 --> 38:49.795
- Well, maybe we can
chat online tonight.

38:49.828 --> 38:51.363
- Not a good idea.

38:51.397 --> 38:52.764
My computer is in the kitchen.

38:52.798 --> 38:54.666
Where it can be supervised
at all times now.

38:54.700 --> 38:56.067
- What?
- Yeah.

38:56.101 --> 38:57.068
- Hi Regan.

38:57.102 --> 38:58.136
- Hi.
- How are you.

38:58.169 --> 38:59.805
- I'm good.

38:59.838 --> 39:00.915
- I hear you're seeing a
friend of mine this afternoon.

39:00.939 --> 39:01.907
- Mhm.

39:01.940 --> 39:02.774
- Dr. Tocaro is fantastic.

39:02.808 --> 39:04.376
You'll love her.

39:04.410 --> 39:06.612
And I told her to take
really good care of you

39:06.645 --> 39:08.747
because you're one of
my favorite patients.

39:08.780 --> 39:10.549
- Thank you.

39:10.582 --> 39:13.619
- I'll see you later.

39:13.652 --> 39:15.787
- Who's Dr. Tocaro?

39:15.821 --> 39:17.022
- A psychologist.

39:17.055 --> 39:18.457
My mom's making me go.

39:18.490 --> 39:20.091
- Why?

39:20.125 --> 39:22.828
- She thinks I need
to talk to someone.

39:22.861 --> 39:25.163
- You can just talk to me.

39:25.196 --> 39:26.765
- I know I can.

39:26.798 --> 39:28.834
But she doesn't know that.

39:28.867 --> 39:30.802
- Psychologists are expensive.

39:30.836 --> 39:32.504
- Are they?

39:32.538 --> 39:33.648
My dad has pretty good
insurance through his work,

39:33.672 --> 39:36.675
so I'm pretty sure
that's covering it.

39:36.708 --> 39:37.509
- Ready, sweetie?

39:37.543 --> 39:38.444
- Yeah.

39:38.477 --> 39:39.177
- Have a nice day.

39:39.210 --> 39:40.579
- You too Nate.

39:48.219 --> 39:51.823
- Dr. Patricia Tocaro,
adolescent counseling.

39:55.226 --> 39:56.795
YACC.

39:56.828 --> 39:57.828
Our Staff.

39:59.197 --> 40:00.966
James Lindstrom.

40:01.933 --> 40:03.769
Youth program director.

40:04.870 --> 40:05.870
Hello James.

40:28.994 --> 40:30.662
- "Pictures are
spreading all over town.

40:30.696 --> 40:32.764
"It's the daughter of your
employee Jim Lindstrom.

40:32.798 --> 40:33.798
"Anonymous."

40:44.075 --> 40:46.020
- Yes, if you can adjust that
one line item from the budget,

40:46.044 --> 40:46.978
I think we're gonna
be good to go.

40:47.012 --> 40:47.879
Alright?

40:47.913 --> 40:49.147
Thank you, Marsha.

40:49.180 --> 40:49.981
- Hey Jimmy.

40:50.015 --> 40:51.015
- Darren.

40:52.250 --> 40:53.250
Are you Okay?

40:57.589 --> 40:58.957
- We got a problem.

40:58.990 --> 41:01.660
I just got off the
phone with Paula.

41:01.693 --> 41:02.528
- Paula Quinn?

41:02.561 --> 41:03.161
From the board?

41:03.194 --> 41:04.195
- Yes.

41:04.229 --> 41:05.631
And she received something,

41:05.664 --> 41:08.667
some rather risque
photos of your daughter.

41:14.205 --> 41:16.542
Did you know about these?

41:16.575 --> 41:17.575
- Yeah.

41:20.912 --> 41:24.082
My daughter, in a momentary
lapse of judgement,

41:24.115 --> 41:26.284
sent these photos to
a boy that she liked.

41:26.317 --> 41:27.653
How did Paula get this email?

41:27.686 --> 41:28.996
She's not in the
high school system.

41:29.020 --> 41:31.723
- They were sent to
her e-mail at YACC.

41:31.757 --> 41:33.825
From an e-mail address
we didn't recognize.

41:33.859 --> 41:34.960
- What?

41:34.993 --> 41:36.170
- Well, she's not the only one.

41:36.194 --> 41:37.929
Tom Fisher called
right after she did.

41:37.963 --> 41:39.106
They were sent to him as well.

41:39.130 --> 41:40.932
- Are you kidding me?

41:40.966 --> 41:42.233
Who's doing this?

41:42.267 --> 41:44.736
- I don't know but
both Paula and Tom

41:44.770 --> 41:47.539
expressed some concern
about the publicity

41:47.573 --> 41:51.509
that might follow if you're
named Senior Director.

41:53.111 --> 41:55.647
I'm worried about us being
involved in an investigation.

41:55.681 --> 41:58.650
This could be construed
as child pornography.

41:58.684 --> 41:59.927
- Whoa, whoa, wait a minute,
wait a minute Darren.

41:59.951 --> 42:00.951
Back up.

42:02.087 --> 42:03.955
This is nothing more
than error of judgment

42:03.989 --> 42:06.291
on the part of a
14-year-old child.

42:06.324 --> 42:08.093
That's it.

42:08.126 --> 42:09.303
Abby and I have already
handled this with the school

42:09.327 --> 42:13.565
and the principal and Regan
is not going to do it again.

42:14.933 --> 42:16.043
- I'm sure you have,
but the problem is,

42:16.067 --> 42:17.836
we don't know who
all is seeing this.

42:17.869 --> 42:19.838
- Well, clearly the person
sending this is someone

42:19.871 --> 42:22.140
who knows that I work here.

42:22.173 --> 42:26.077
Maybe it's the parents of
the boy who sent the photos.

42:26.111 --> 42:30.015
They're probably angry that
he got in trouble for it?

42:31.049 --> 42:32.784
I don't know who's doing this.

42:34.185 --> 42:36.788
But I'm going to find out.

42:36.822 --> 42:38.724
- Look, I'm really sorry, Jim.

42:38.757 --> 42:41.059
I'll do as much damage
control as I can.

42:41.092 --> 42:43.595
But make sure Regan is careful.

42:55.674 --> 42:58.810
- I'm sure the attention
you received from Austin

42:58.844 --> 43:01.980
when he liked your photos
made you feel good.

43:02.013 --> 43:03.782
- It did.

43:03.815 --> 43:07.118
And I liked that he wanted me
more than he wanted Sabine.

43:08.119 --> 43:09.320
- Well, that makes sense.

43:10.822 --> 43:13.725
I mean, you finally
had what she didn't.

43:15.026 --> 43:18.163
Regan, let me ask
you a question.

43:18.196 --> 43:20.732
On a scale from one to 10,

43:20.766 --> 43:22.668
One being hideously ugly,

43:23.869 --> 43:26.237
and 10 being
supermodel gorgeous,

43:27.906 --> 43:30.108
where do you think you are?

43:37.716 --> 43:38.716
- A two.

43:41.953 --> 43:44.022
- You think you're a two?

43:45.824 --> 43:48.727
- I mean, a guy that likes
me says I'm beautiful but,

43:48.760 --> 43:50.161
it's a lie.

43:50.195 --> 43:51.830
- Who is this guy?

43:53.999 --> 43:55.300
- A friend.

43:55.333 --> 43:56.935
He's really nice.

43:56.968 --> 43:59.204
He gave me this key chain.

43:59.237 --> 44:00.305
- He goes to your school?

44:00.338 --> 44:01.338
- No.

44:02.373 --> 44:04.843
- How did you meet him?

44:06.444 --> 44:07.946
At Sabine's house.

44:20.058 --> 44:21.126
- Hi honey.

44:21.159 --> 44:23.461
- Hi Dad
- You're home early.

44:23.494 --> 44:27.398
It went really well with Dr.
Tocaro, so that's good news.

44:28.333 --> 44:29.200
- Yeah.

44:29.234 --> 44:30.401
She was really nice.

44:30.435 --> 44:31.937
It was different
than what I expected.

44:31.970 --> 44:35.440
- And I got us tickets
to a fashion show

44:35.473 --> 44:37.675
so that's going to be fun.

44:39.510 --> 44:40.888
- Hey Regan, I need
to talk to your mom

44:40.912 --> 44:42.814
alone for a minute, okay?

44:43.815 --> 44:44.815
- Sure.

44:47.518 --> 44:48.518
- What's up?

44:53.091 --> 44:56.995
- These were sent to
everybody on the board today.

44:58.263 --> 45:01.232
Darren says it could
jeopardize my promotion.

45:01.266 --> 45:02.901
- Who would do this?

45:04.069 --> 45:05.170
- I'm not sure.

45:07.072 --> 45:10.408
But clearly it's someone
who's trying to get me fired.

45:10.441 --> 45:12.510
- They're letting you go?

45:12.543 --> 45:14.279
- Not yet.

45:14.312 --> 45:17.949
But I don't know how it's gonna
pan out and it's not over.

45:22.120 --> 45:25.523
- I don't think we
should tell Regan though.

45:25.556 --> 45:27.501
I think she would feel
terrible if she thought she was

45:27.525 --> 45:30.395
responsible for you not getting
your promotion, you know?

45:30.428 --> 45:31.428
- I agree.

45:33.464 --> 45:37.368
Once it's up online, it
could've ended up anywhere.

45:39.304 --> 45:42.808
I'm going to find out
who's behind this though.

45:42.841 --> 45:44.375
That's for damn sure.

45:55.453 --> 45:56.521
- Allergies, none

45:56.554 --> 45:58.289
Medication, penicillin

46:10.869 --> 46:11.869
Hey there.

46:14.105 --> 46:15.073
Are you Tommy?

46:15.106 --> 46:16.808
- Yup.
- Hi, I'm Abby.

46:16.842 --> 46:18.476
Nice to meet you.

46:18.509 --> 46:21.512
This is going to be
so, so easy, okay?

46:21.546 --> 46:23.048
I promise.

46:23.081 --> 46:24.081
Okay,

46:45.203 --> 46:46.203
You ready?

46:51.209 --> 46:55.113
You're just going to feel
a little pinch, all right?

46:55.513 --> 46:56.581
Awesome!

46:56.614 --> 46:58.049
You're all done!

46:58.083 --> 46:59.584
You did so good!

46:59.617 --> 47:01.352
Nicely done!

47:01.386 --> 47:03.354
Do you want a sticker?

47:03.388 --> 47:04.388
- Sure.

47:06.657 --> 47:08.960
- Good choice, high five!

47:08.994 --> 47:10.195
You did awesome.

47:20.171 --> 47:21.171
My god!

47:22.974 --> 47:24.375
Dr. Blockman, I need you now!

47:28.079 --> 47:29.847
Okay, the Dr's on her way, Okay?

47:30.916 --> 47:32.383
- Everything okay in here?

47:32.417 --> 47:36.021
- I don't know, it looks
like an allergic reaction!

47:36.054 --> 47:39.190
- Okay Abby, grab me an Epi-pen!

47:39.224 --> 47:40.234
What kind of shot
did she give him?

47:40.258 --> 47:41.292
- Tetanus.

47:41.326 --> 47:43.028
- No, Penicillin.

47:43.061 --> 47:44.029
- Penicillin?

47:44.062 --> 47:44.930
No, he's allergic to Penicillin!

47:44.963 --> 47:45.963
- Okay.

47:51.036 --> 47:52.103
Nate, call an ambulance.

47:52.137 --> 47:54.405
I want him transported to ER.

47:56.174 --> 47:57.551
- It didn't say
anything about that on.

47:57.575 --> 47:58.409
- We got it.

47:58.443 --> 48:00.145
Thanks, Abby.

48:00.178 --> 48:01.579
Come on kiddo.

48:01.612 --> 48:02.612
There you go!

48:04.950 --> 48:05.950
- What?

48:22.067 --> 48:23.377
- The little boy
was fine though, right?

48:23.401 --> 48:25.570
- Yeah, that's not the point.

48:27.738 --> 48:30.942
I mean, this poor kid
could have died today

48:30.976 --> 48:32.910
because of me and I just.

48:35.480 --> 48:38.249
It was literally right
there on the chart.

48:38.283 --> 48:39.283
I just.

48:42.453 --> 48:44.289
I don't know where my head is.

48:44.322 --> 48:46.300
- I know you feel bad but
you're a good nurse, honey.

48:46.324 --> 48:47.725
You made a mistake once.

48:47.758 --> 48:48.998
Don't beat yourself up over it.

48:49.027 --> 48:50.027
Okay?

48:53.598 --> 48:56.567
- So when are you supposed to
see that head-shrinker again?

48:56.601 --> 48:58.503
- Dr. Tocaro?

48:58.536 --> 48:59.670
- Yeah.

48:59.704 --> 49:01.206
- Wednesday.

49:01.239 --> 49:03.474
And, why do you call
her a head-shrinker?

49:03.508 --> 49:05.210
- That's what people
call psychologists.

49:05.243 --> 49:08.179
'Cause they get into your
head and they screw you up.

49:08.213 --> 49:09.714
- No they don't.

49:09.747 --> 49:11.549
- Just watch.

49:11.582 --> 49:15.020
I bet she's going to tell you
that we shouldn't be friends.

49:15.520 --> 49:16.587
- Why?

49:16.621 --> 49:17.555
- I don't know.

49:17.588 --> 49:19.190
Just be careful what you say.

49:19.224 --> 49:22.560
Anything you tell her,
she'll repeat it to your mom.

49:22.593 --> 49:24.562
- She said she wouldn't do that.

49:24.595 --> 49:26.064
- Okay.

49:26.097 --> 49:28.366
Well, if you wanna
believe that, go ahead.

49:28.399 --> 49:30.401
- You think she lied about that?

49:30.435 --> 49:32.070
- I mean, think about it.

49:32.103 --> 49:34.205
If your mom and
dad are paying her.

49:34.239 --> 49:36.541
You think she'll
really keep a secret?

49:36.574 --> 49:37.574
No way.

49:40.078 --> 49:41.078
I miss you.

49:41.812 --> 49:44.015
- I miss you too.

49:44.049 --> 49:45.450
- Can I come pick you up?

49:45.483 --> 49:46.584
- Right now?

49:46.617 --> 49:48.319
- Yeah, why not?

49:48.353 --> 49:52.057
I'll have you back before
your parents even wake up.

49:52.090 --> 49:53.090
- Not tonight.

49:54.825 --> 49:57.262
- Okay, so you don't
miss me that much?

49:57.295 --> 49:58.295
- Yes I do.

49:59.530 --> 50:01.232
- Well, then let me
come pick you up.

50:01.266 --> 50:04.602
I'll be there in
like 10 minutes.

50:04.635 --> 50:05.635
- Wait.

50:26.524 --> 50:29.094
- I hope you don't
mind if I stare.

50:29.127 --> 50:30.561
I just can't help myself.

50:30.595 --> 50:32.163
You're, beautiful.

50:35.600 --> 50:38.269
- I wish we didn't have
to meet up in secret.

50:38.303 --> 50:40.705
I hate lying to my mom and dad.

50:42.873 --> 50:46.377
- You know I can go
to jail for that,

50:46.411 --> 50:48.779
you can never tell
anyone that we hang out.

50:48.813 --> 50:50.115
- Really?

50:50.148 --> 50:51.516
Jail?

50:51.549 --> 50:52.850
- Yeah.

50:52.883 --> 50:54.652
I'm 22.

50:54.685 --> 50:58.623
I can't date anyone
under 18, it's illegal.

50:59.557 --> 51:01.326
- That's a stupid law.

51:01.359 --> 51:02.359
- I agree.

51:03.561 --> 51:06.131
But it's worth the risk.

51:06.164 --> 51:08.599
That's how much
I care about you.

51:15.573 --> 51:18.143
You have an eyelash right there.

51:21.479 --> 51:24.115
Close your eyes and make a wish.

51:28.153 --> 51:29.363
- I thought I was
supposed to do that.

51:29.387 --> 51:30.655
- No.

51:30.688 --> 51:31.389
The person who blows
it off is the one

51:31.422 --> 51:34.125
that makes your wish come true.

51:53.344 --> 51:55.380
- What's wrong?

51:55.413 --> 51:56.514
- I don't know.

51:58.349 --> 52:01.652
I'm started to get worried
about this psychologist.

52:03.221 --> 52:03.788
I'm getting a bad
feeling that they're

52:03.821 --> 52:04.822
trying to split us up.

52:04.855 --> 52:05.856
- I told you already.

52:05.890 --> 52:07.392
I'm not going to say anything.

52:07.425 --> 52:09.227
- You just don't get it.

52:09.260 --> 52:10.904
These shrinks like to
get inside your brain

52:10.928 --> 52:14.699
and they make you say things
that you don't want to say.

52:14.732 --> 52:16.634
I used to go to one.

52:16.667 --> 52:18.269
- What should I do?

52:20.471 --> 52:22.507
- You should stop going.

52:22.540 --> 52:23.508
- I have to.

52:23.541 --> 52:26.344
My parents are making me.

52:26.377 --> 52:28.846
- Look, I should've known
this wasn't going to work.

52:28.879 --> 52:31.249
- No, don't say that!

52:31.282 --> 52:33.651
I want to be with you.

52:33.684 --> 52:36.487
- But you want to please
your parents more.

52:36.521 --> 52:37.355
- That's not true.

52:37.388 --> 52:38.388
It's just,

52:40.491 --> 52:42.860
I feel really torn.

52:42.893 --> 52:46.831
- Promise me that you
stop seeing Dr. Tocaro.

52:48.466 --> 52:51.469
Otherwise, I know my
heart will be broken

52:51.502 --> 52:53.538
and we may as well
end things now.

52:53.571 --> 52:54.639
- I promise!

52:54.672 --> 52:55.473
I'll figure something out.

52:55.506 --> 52:56.506
I swear.

53:02.913 --> 53:04.715
- It's getting pretty light out.

53:04.749 --> 53:06.451
I gotta get you home.

53:26.904 --> 53:27.738
- Regan, what the hell are you?

53:27.772 --> 53:28.939
- Shh!

53:28.973 --> 53:30.875
You'll wake mom and dad.

53:32.009 --> 53:33.711
- Did you sneak out?

53:35.446 --> 53:38.783
- My God, please please
please don't tell them.

53:39.684 --> 53:40.651
- Where were you?

53:40.685 --> 53:41.786
- To the park.

53:41.819 --> 53:42.720
- With who?

53:42.753 --> 53:44.322
- I was by myself.

53:45.623 --> 53:47.392
- I don't buy that for a second.

53:47.425 --> 53:48.602
If you don't tell me
who you were with,

53:48.626 --> 53:50.661
I'm gonna go wake up
mom and dad right now.

53:50.695 --> 53:52.430
- Okay.

53:52.463 --> 53:55.766
But you have to promise not
to tell them I was leaving.

53:56.834 --> 53:58.969
- What are you girls doing?

54:02.307 --> 54:03.608
- Nothing.

54:03.641 --> 54:05.343
We were just, getting
a drink of water.

54:05.376 --> 54:07.244
- Okay, go back to bed.

54:08.979 --> 54:09.979
- We will.

54:12.617 --> 54:13.718
There.

54:13.751 --> 54:14.852
Now fess up.

54:14.885 --> 54:16.454
- Fine.

54:16.487 --> 54:18.022
I was a meeting a boy.

54:19.790 --> 54:21.826
- You walked all the way
to the park to meet a boy?

54:21.859 --> 54:23.328
Who?

54:23.361 --> 54:24.429
- He drove me there.

54:24.462 --> 54:25.462
In his car.

54:26.464 --> 54:27.632
- His Car?

54:27.665 --> 54:28.699
How old is he?

54:30.368 --> 54:31.336
- He's, 16.

54:31.369 --> 54:32.303
You don't know him.

54:32.337 --> 54:33.971
He goes to Angeles High School.

54:34.004 --> 54:35.081
- Mom and Dad would
freak out if they

54:35.105 --> 54:37.875
knew you were dating
a 16-year-old.

54:39.377 --> 54:41.379
What's his name?

54:41.412 --> 54:42.412
- Milo.

54:43.614 --> 54:46.417
He's super cool and
I really like him.

54:46.451 --> 54:48.819
Plus I'll be 15 in
like five months

54:48.853 --> 54:52.757
so the age difference isn't
really that big of a deal.

54:53.791 --> 54:55.960
Please, please don't tell them.

54:57.395 --> 54:58.395
- Alright.

54:59.597 --> 55:01.532
But, you have to swear,

55:01.566 --> 55:04.902
you have to swear that you will
tell me when you sneak out.

55:04.935 --> 55:06.437
Someone has to
know where you are

55:06.471 --> 55:08.839
and if mom and dad
notice that you're gone,

55:08.873 --> 55:11.041
they won't freak out
and call the cops again.

55:11.075 --> 55:12.543
- Deal.

55:12.577 --> 55:15.713
Thank you, you're like
the best sister ever.

55:17.114 --> 55:18.649
- Go to bed, Regan.

55:29.026 --> 55:30.026
- Hey.
- Hey.

55:30.761 --> 55:32.497
- Looks good.

55:32.530 --> 55:36.434
- Honey, do you think with
the promotion in limbo,

55:37.968 --> 55:41.071
and everything, maybe we
should rethink giving Taylor...

55:41.105 --> 55:43.441
- No, no, it's her sweet 16.

55:44.475 --> 55:45.643
I want to do it.

55:49.847 --> 55:51.516
- You're right.

55:51.549 --> 55:54.819
Let's just forget about
what an absolute crappy week

55:56.153 --> 55:58.823
we both had and, just
try and enjoy this day.

56:01.191 --> 56:04.529
Can you believe that we
have a kid that can drive?

56:04.562 --> 56:06.764
I mean, when did that happen?

56:08.933 --> 56:10.067
- 40 is the new 20,

56:10.100 --> 56:11.636
- Yeah, yeah.

56:11.669 --> 56:14.972
Tell that to my
40-year-old body.

56:15.005 --> 56:18.909
- There ain't nothing wrong
with your 40-year-old body,

56:21.479 --> 56:22.547
- Get a room.

56:23.848 --> 56:26.651
- Honey, can you
go get your sister?

56:28.986 --> 56:30.788
Thanks, Love!

56:32.156 --> 56:33.157
- Nice.

56:33.190 --> 56:34.425
Yay!
- Happy Birthday!

56:34.459 --> 56:35.192
- Thanks, Mom!

56:35.225 --> 56:36.093
- Happy Birthday, Sweetie!

56:36.126 --> 56:37.027
- Thanks, Dad!

56:37.061 --> 56:38.863
- Alright, let's do it!

56:38.896 --> 56:39.864
- Here Honey.

56:39.897 --> 56:41.466
This is from me and your dad.

56:41.499 --> 56:43.901
- Just a little something!

56:45.703 --> 56:46.537
- No way!

56:46.571 --> 56:47.571
- Way!

56:49.640 --> 56:50.541
- Go check the driveway.

56:50.575 --> 56:51.208
- Shut up!

56:51.241 --> 56:52.241
My god!

57:08.192 --> 57:09.694
Hey.

57:09.727 --> 57:10.727
- Hey.

57:12.196 --> 57:13.196
- You okay?

57:14.164 --> 57:15.164
- Yeah.

57:16.667 --> 57:18.002
- Listen.

57:18.035 --> 57:21.205
I know you're going through some

57:21.238 --> 57:23.007
tough stuff right now,

57:23.040 --> 57:25.175
so, if you ever need a ride,

57:25.209 --> 57:28.245
I'll take you wherever
you want to go.

57:28.278 --> 57:29.278
- Thanks.

57:33.651 --> 57:34.852
- How's your guy?

57:36.086 --> 57:37.121
Milo, right?

57:37.154 --> 57:38.154
- Yeah.

57:39.757 --> 57:41.559
- Have you guys kissed yet?

57:41.592 --> 57:42.693
- No, not yet.

57:44.228 --> 57:45.996
I kinda want to.

57:47.064 --> 57:48.633
What kind of car does he drive?

57:48.666 --> 57:50.901
- Um, a Mercedes I think.

57:50.935 --> 57:52.670
Yeah, super fancy.

57:52.703 --> 57:54.872
- Mercedes, must be loaded.

57:54.905 --> 57:56.774
- Yeah, his parents are.

57:58.142 --> 57:59.644
I don't even know
why he has a job,

57:59.677 --> 58:01.646
because they're
like millionaires.

58:01.679 --> 58:03.814
- Where does he work?

58:03.848 --> 58:06.951
- Um, at that yogurt
shop in the mall.

58:06.984 --> 58:07.984
- Cool.

58:09.620 --> 58:13.624
Well, maybe sometime we
can go and visit him.

58:13.658 --> 58:14.825
Just you and me.

58:16.026 --> 58:17.026
- Sure.

58:19.129 --> 58:20.497
- Keep studying!

58:42.753 --> 58:45.656
- Hey love, you're still up?

58:46.924 --> 58:47.924
- Yeah.

58:49.293 --> 58:51.328
- Did you have a good birthday?

58:51.361 --> 58:52.597
- The best.

58:52.630 --> 58:53.998
You and Dad are amazing.

58:54.031 --> 58:56.066
- You're amazing, honey.

58:56.100 --> 58:57.167
You deserve it.

59:00.004 --> 59:03.908
- There's something I've
been meaning to tell you.

59:08.846 --> 59:10.147
- Okay,

59:10.180 --> 59:11.816
- It's about Regan.

59:11.849 --> 59:13.851
She can't know I told you.

59:15.319 --> 59:17.755
- Honey, if there's something
that we should know,

59:17.788 --> 59:19.790
then you should tell us.

59:22.993 --> 59:23.993
- Well,

59:26.296 --> 59:30.200
Regan snuck out last night
to meet a boy she likes.

59:31.869 --> 59:32.869
He's 16.

59:44.014 --> 59:45.258
- So there's nobody
named Milo who works

59:45.282 --> 59:47.918
at that yogurt shop in the mall.

59:47.952 --> 59:50.387
- You think she lied about
his name or the school?

59:50.420 --> 59:51.889
Or both?

59:51.922 --> 59:52.922
- Who knows.

59:54.324 --> 59:56.794
- Well, one of our patient's
kids goes to South.

59:56.827 --> 59:57.971
I left her a message
to see if she knows

59:57.995 --> 59:59.664
anything about this kid.

59:59.697 --> 01:00:01.007
- Regardless, I think we
need to confront Regan

01:00:01.031 --> 01:00:03.333
about it when she
gets home tonight.

01:00:03.367 --> 01:00:05.269
- And betray Taylor's trust?

01:00:05.302 --> 01:00:06.971
No way.

01:00:07.004 --> 01:00:08.639
Yeah, that'll be great!

01:00:08.673 --> 01:00:12.009
Then we'll have two kids
that won't tell us anything.

01:00:12.777 --> 01:00:13.811
- You're right.

01:00:22.286 --> 01:00:23.821
- The troll's here.

01:00:23.854 --> 01:00:24.689
I'm gonna bounce.

01:00:24.722 --> 01:00:26.090
- See you in econ.

01:00:28.392 --> 01:00:30.695
- Um, are you dating Austin now?

01:00:30.728 --> 01:00:33.230
- Made it official
after first period.

01:00:33.263 --> 01:00:35.399
- How can you do that
after what he did to me?

01:00:35.432 --> 01:00:37.835
He sent my pictures
all over the school

01:00:37.868 --> 01:00:39.336
and got me in so much trouble.

01:00:39.369 --> 01:00:40.037
- Maybe you shouldn't have sent

01:00:40.070 --> 01:00:43.107
those pictures to begin with.

01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:45.342
- Wait, are you seriously be
siding with him right now?

01:00:45.375 --> 01:00:46.310
- I'm staying out of it.

01:00:46.343 --> 01:00:49.046
This between you and him.

01:00:49.079 --> 01:00:50.247
- Unbelievable.

01:00:51.215 --> 01:00:53.083
You know what?

01:00:53.117 --> 01:00:54.294
I don't care what Austin thinks

01:00:54.318 --> 01:00:56.186
and I don't care what
you think either.

01:00:56.220 --> 01:00:58.989
I have a boyfriend who's
much better than him anyway.

01:00:59.023 --> 01:01:01.125
Not a boy, a man.

01:01:01.158 --> 01:01:01.992
- No you don't.

01:01:02.026 --> 01:01:02.860
That's a lie.

01:01:02.893 --> 01:01:04.394
- Yes I do.

01:01:04.428 --> 01:01:06.306
He's 22, he drives a Mercedes
and he's in love with me.

01:01:06.330 --> 01:01:07.330
So suck it.

01:01:21.245 --> 01:01:22.980
- Hey guys, how are you?

01:01:23.013 --> 01:01:24.925
If you can, just go ahead
and fill this out for me.

01:01:24.949 --> 01:01:27.217
He'll be with you in a second.

01:02:19.870 --> 01:02:20.870
- Jim!

01:02:32.316 --> 01:02:33.316
Regan!

01:02:35.085 --> 01:02:36.085
- Hey!

01:02:36.954 --> 01:02:38.155
Come here!

01:02:38.188 --> 01:02:40.524
Come here you son
of a, come here.

01:02:40.557 --> 01:02:42.292
Get in the house!

01:02:42.326 --> 01:02:43.326
- Go!

01:02:48.332 --> 01:02:49.575
I can't believe that
you would do this.

01:02:49.599 --> 01:02:52.536
After everything
that we talked about!

01:02:52.569 --> 01:02:54.438
Honey, we trusted you!

01:02:55.572 --> 01:02:57.307
- Why are you doing this to me?

01:02:57.341 --> 01:03:00.110
I love him and want
to be with him!

01:03:00.144 --> 01:03:01.946
- Who Regan?

01:03:01.979 --> 01:03:03.447
Who do you want to be with?

01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:05.558
- His name's Milo and he
goes to Angeles High School.

01:03:05.582 --> 01:03:06.851
- No it's not!

01:03:08.518 --> 01:03:10.855
There is no Milo that
works at any yogurt shop,

01:03:10.888 --> 01:03:12.422
so you are lying to me!

01:03:12.456 --> 01:03:16.326
Now stop playing games
and you tell me who he is!

01:03:18.863 --> 01:03:21.498
- How do you even
know to ask that?

01:03:23.067 --> 01:03:24.301
You told 'em!

01:03:24.334 --> 01:03:26.203
You promised me
that you wouldn't!

01:03:26.236 --> 01:03:27.981
- God, I should never
have told you anything!

01:03:28.005 --> 01:03:29.273
I knew you would do this!

01:03:29.306 --> 01:03:30.207
- Taylor!

01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:32.442
- I'm so sorry, Regan!

01:03:32.476 --> 01:03:35.545
- Taylor, please go
to your room, honey.

01:03:40.050 --> 01:03:42.519
Now you're going to
tell me who he is

01:03:42.552 --> 01:03:44.588
and you're going to give
me his phone number.

01:03:44.621 --> 01:03:45.621
Right now.

01:03:46.891 --> 01:03:49.159
- I'm not giving you anything!

01:03:56.433 --> 01:03:57.601
- Who is this?

01:03:59.403 --> 01:04:02.006
- You know, you can't stop
me from seeing your daughter.

01:04:02.039 --> 01:04:03.607
- She is 14 years old.

01:04:06.443 --> 01:04:08.412
I'm not going to let
you ever see her again.

01:04:08.445 --> 01:04:09.947
- You think so?

01:04:09.980 --> 01:04:11.281
I own her and you.

01:04:13.483 --> 01:04:15.519
How are things at work?

01:04:15.552 --> 01:04:19.256
It would be a shame if more
pictures started showing up.

01:04:19.289 --> 01:04:20.857
- You listen to me.

01:04:22.559 --> 01:04:25.495
You will stay away
from my daughter.

01:04:25.529 --> 01:04:28.398
And you're going to stay
away from my family.

01:04:28.432 --> 01:04:29.633
And if you don't.

01:04:36.306 --> 01:04:37.306
- Jim.

01:04:38.976 --> 01:04:40.444
- Regan, go upstairs.

01:04:43.347 --> 01:04:44.347
Now!

01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:51.188
- What is it?

01:04:53.523 --> 01:04:56.226
- He's the one who sent
the pictures to the board.

01:04:56.260 --> 01:04:57.661
- What?

01:04:57.694 --> 01:04:59.629
- He just admitted to it.

01:05:01.165 --> 01:05:03.633
He also told me
that he owns Regan.

01:05:08.572 --> 01:05:10.240
- Morning.
- Morning.

01:05:10.274 --> 01:05:11.241
- You look tired.

01:05:11.275 --> 01:05:12.176
I was about to make some coffee.

01:05:12.209 --> 01:05:13.410
You want some?

01:05:13.443 --> 01:05:14.620
- Yeah, please, that'd
be great, thanks.

01:05:14.644 --> 01:05:17.214
Did any messages come
in for me or anything?

01:05:17.247 --> 01:05:18.082
- Yes.

01:05:18.115 --> 01:05:19.950
One message

01:05:19.984 --> 01:05:21.952
from some lawyers
office regarding the

01:05:21.986 --> 01:05:25.322
investigation over the
penicillin incident.

01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:33.263
- I actually can't
believe this is happening.

01:05:33.297 --> 01:05:34.297
- I know.

01:05:35.532 --> 01:05:39.036
We can hopefully find a
way to get through it.

01:05:41.471 --> 01:05:43.573
- He actually said he owned her?

01:05:43.607 --> 01:05:46.743
- Those were his exact words.

01:05:46.776 --> 01:05:47.611
- Wow!

01:05:47.644 --> 01:05:49.079
- I know, I know.

01:05:49.113 --> 01:05:51.681
And she won't even
tell us who he is.

01:05:53.483 --> 01:05:57.087
I'm just hoping Dr. Tocaro gets
something out of her today.

01:05:57.121 --> 01:05:58.122
I just.

01:05:58.155 --> 01:05:59.089
- If anyone can, she will.

01:05:59.123 --> 01:06:00.657
She's the best in the business.

01:06:00.690 --> 01:06:03.327
Man, this guy sounds
like a psycho.

01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:05.295
- Who's a psycho?

01:06:05.329 --> 01:06:06.696
- Thanks.

01:06:06.730 --> 01:06:08.298
- No one.

01:06:08.332 --> 01:06:10.300
Just this guy that Abby met.

01:06:10.334 --> 01:06:11.744
Well, if nothing comes
of the session today,

01:06:11.768 --> 01:06:14.471
I say you get the
police involved.

01:06:14.504 --> 01:06:15.705
- What's going on?

01:06:15.739 --> 01:06:17.207
What happened?

01:06:17.241 --> 01:06:20.510
- It's nothing I want
to get into, really.

01:06:21.645 --> 01:06:23.147
It's a long story.

01:06:23.180 --> 01:06:24.548
- Well, okay.

01:06:24.581 --> 01:06:27.784
Look, if you need anyone
to talk, I'm here.

01:06:27.817 --> 01:06:29.119
- Thanks, Nate.

01:06:30.354 --> 01:06:31.388
Appreciate it.

01:06:44.834 --> 01:06:46.370
Listen to me, honey.

01:06:46.403 --> 01:06:49.373
You can trust Dr. Tocaro, okay.

01:06:49.406 --> 01:06:53.243
She's not going to repeat
anything that you say, okay.

01:06:53.277 --> 01:06:56.280
Just, it's best thing to be
open and honest with her.

01:06:56.313 --> 01:06:57.614
- Okay.

01:06:57.647 --> 01:06:59.649
- Okay, I'll pick
you up in an hour.

01:06:59.683 --> 01:07:01.185
I love you, kiddo.

01:07:01.218 --> 01:07:02.218
- Bye.

01:07:11.561 --> 01:07:13.630
- I felt that you
were really open to me

01:07:13.663 --> 01:07:15.365
last time we talked, Regan.

01:07:15.399 --> 01:07:19.269
But today, it seems you don't
want to talk very much at all.

01:07:20.770 --> 01:07:24.641
Did something happen between
last session and today?

01:07:25.342 --> 01:07:26.843
- No.

01:07:26.876 --> 01:07:29.179
It's just I'm just sick of
people telling me what to do.

01:07:29.213 --> 01:07:32.182
I don't even want to be here.

01:07:32.216 --> 01:07:33.216
- Why not?

01:07:34.251 --> 01:07:37.387
I thought you liked
talking to me.

01:07:37.421 --> 01:07:39.365
- You're just trying to
get inside my head and then

01:07:39.389 --> 01:07:42.692
shrink it and then tell my
mom and dad everything I say.

01:07:42.726 --> 01:07:45.495
- Regan, that is
absolutely untrue.

01:07:48.532 --> 01:07:50.367
Who told you that?

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:51.400
- No one.

01:08:23.767 --> 01:08:26.470
- So tell me about
this boyfriend.

01:08:27.504 --> 01:08:28.904
What's he like?

01:08:28.938 --> 01:08:31.908
- I don't want to
talk about him.

01:08:31.941 --> 01:08:34.578
- Okay, maybe we
can talk about what

01:08:34.611 --> 01:08:37.514
you're looking for
in a boyfriend.

01:08:37.546 --> 01:08:40.783
The qualities you're
looking for maybe

01:08:40.817 --> 01:08:43.819
in somebody that
you'd like to be with.

01:08:43.853 --> 01:08:47.491
- I guess I want someone
who is older than me.

01:08:47.524 --> 01:08:48.457
- Really?

01:08:48.492 --> 01:08:49.859
How old?

01:08:49.893 --> 01:08:50.794
- I don't know.

01:08:50.827 --> 01:08:52.562
Out of school.

01:08:52.595 --> 01:08:55.932
Yeah, I hate all
the kids at school.

01:08:55.965 --> 01:08:56.965
- Okay.

01:08:58.234 --> 01:09:01.238
Well, he would probably
then have a job.

01:09:02.538 --> 01:09:06.443
What kind of job do
you want him to have?

01:09:07.777 --> 01:09:08.821
- Well, a job where he
makes a lot of money

01:09:08.845 --> 01:09:10.613
so he can buy me stuff.

01:09:11.915 --> 01:09:14.518
Maybe like in a doctor's office.

01:09:16.220 --> 01:09:18.921
Anything in the medical field.

01:09:18.955 --> 01:09:20.357
- Okay.

01:09:20.390 --> 01:09:21.390
What else?

01:09:23.493 --> 01:09:25.495
- Maybe drive a nice car.

01:09:49.653 --> 01:09:50.720
- You ready, love?

01:09:50.754 --> 01:09:51.621
- Mhm.

01:09:51.654 --> 01:09:52.856
- Mrs. Lindstrom,

01:09:52.889 --> 01:09:54.758
can I speak with you
for just a moment?

01:09:54.791 --> 01:09:55.992
- Of course.

01:09:56.025 --> 01:09:57.327
Where are you going?

01:09:57.361 --> 01:09:58.562
- The bathroom.

01:09:58.595 --> 01:10:01.398
Can I not do that
without a babysitter?

01:10:10.374 --> 01:10:11.441
- Hey gorgeous.

01:10:11.475 --> 01:10:12.475
- Nate!

01:10:13.477 --> 01:10:14.311
- Shh, come on.

01:10:14.344 --> 01:10:15.512
Before your mom sees us.

01:10:15.545 --> 01:10:16.689
- I can't leave
with you right now.

01:10:16.713 --> 01:10:18.582
- Well, why not?

01:10:18.615 --> 01:10:20.917
- Because, my parents
would kill me.

01:10:20.950 --> 01:10:22.362
They're super pissed
at you right now.

01:10:22.386 --> 01:10:23.696
My Dad thinks that
you sent my picture

01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:24.954
to everyone he works with.

01:10:24.988 --> 01:10:26.323
- Yeah, I did.

01:10:27.824 --> 01:10:28.925
- What, why?

01:10:28.958 --> 01:10:29.959
- Why?

01:10:29.993 --> 01:10:31.495
Because your dad's a jerk.

01:10:31.528 --> 01:10:34.431
He thinks he can control
everything that you do.

01:10:34.464 --> 01:10:36.700
Besides, look I know that
you hate coming here anyway.

01:10:36.733 --> 01:10:39.803
So, if he gets fired, then
he'll lose his insurance

01:10:39.836 --> 01:10:41.605
and you'll never have
to come here again.

01:10:41.638 --> 01:10:43.973
- I don't want my
dad to lose his job.

01:10:44.007 --> 01:10:45.475
- What do you care?

01:10:45.509 --> 01:10:47.811
You basically said
that you hated him.

01:10:47.844 --> 01:10:48.678
- I know but that's not...

01:10:48.712 --> 01:10:49.946
- Alright, come on.

01:10:49.979 --> 01:10:50.547
Your mom's gonna be here
in a minute, let's go.

01:10:50.580 --> 01:10:51.915
- No.

01:10:51.948 --> 01:10:52.616
I'm sick of being
in trouble, okay.

01:10:52.649 --> 01:10:53.649
I can't.

01:10:55.018 --> 01:10:57.053
- You're being a real
pain in the ass right now.

01:10:57.086 --> 01:10:59.589
I left work early to
come you up, now come on.

01:10:59.623 --> 01:11:00.890
- Nate, no!

01:11:00.924 --> 01:11:02.559
- I said, let's go!

01:11:11.801 --> 01:11:13.470
- Thank you for that update.

01:11:13.503 --> 01:11:16.640
I think having her come two
times a week is a great idea.

01:11:17.907 --> 01:11:18.207
- I'll see you next
Wednesday then.

01:11:18.241 --> 01:11:19.509
- Okay.

01:11:19.543 --> 01:11:20.410
- Will you excuse me,

01:11:20.444 --> 01:11:22.412
I need to meet
somebody right outside.

01:11:22.446 --> 01:11:23.747
- Yeah, of course.

01:11:31.888 --> 01:11:32.888
- Regan?

01:11:39.363 --> 01:11:41.865
Have you seen my
daughter, Regan?

01:11:47.904 --> 01:11:48.938
- Mom!

01:11:48.972 --> 01:11:49.906
Mom!

01:11:49.939 --> 01:11:51.408
Mom,

01:11:51.441 --> 01:11:53.109
Mom!
- Regan!

01:11:53.142 --> 01:11:53.977
- Mom!

01:11:54.010 --> 01:11:54.878
- Regan!

01:11:54.911 --> 01:11:55.979
- Mom!
- Regan!

01:11:56.012 --> 01:11:57.614
- Mom!

01:11:57.647 --> 01:11:58.815
Mom,

01:11:58.848 --> 01:11:59.683
mom!

01:11:59.716 --> 01:12:00.716
- Regan!

01:12:09.125 --> 01:12:10.560
- Abby!

01:12:10.594 --> 01:12:12.037
Abby, please wait for
the police, honey.

01:12:12.061 --> 01:12:13.406
Alright, look, I'm on
my way to Detective

01:12:13.430 --> 01:12:14.940
White's office right
now to see if they

01:12:14.964 --> 01:12:17.467
can trace these N-Dog
calls and texts.

01:12:17.501 --> 01:12:19.403
- Okay, and,

01:12:19.436 --> 01:12:22.472
I'll, I'll call Sabine
and any of Regan's

01:12:22.506 --> 01:12:26.109
friends that may have
some idea who this guy is.

01:12:36.085 --> 01:12:37.887
- It's an internet phone number

01:12:37.921 --> 01:12:39.856
and all the texts
are through GEM.

01:12:39.889 --> 01:12:42.392
We can't trace the number,
but we contacted GEM

01:12:42.426 --> 01:12:45.061
and requested any information
associated with this account.

01:12:45.094 --> 01:12:46.430
- How long will that take?

01:12:46.463 --> 01:12:47.997
- They are not
obligated to respond,

01:12:48.031 --> 01:12:49.933
but ever since Tara disappeared,

01:12:49.966 --> 01:12:52.869
and we were able to link it
back to texts sent on GEM,

01:12:52.902 --> 01:12:55.439
they have been very cooperative.

01:12:55.472 --> 01:12:57.173
- Well, did you find Tara?

01:12:57.206 --> 01:12:58.675
Is she okay?

01:12:58.708 --> 01:13:00.410
- We haven't found her yet,

01:13:00.444 --> 01:13:03.112
but the connection to
GEM is very important.

01:13:03.146 --> 01:13:05.048
- So this could be the same guy?

01:13:05.081 --> 01:13:06.583
- We don't know that
that's the case.

01:13:06.616 --> 01:13:08.785
- This is insane!

01:13:08.818 --> 01:13:10.053
You have two child abductions,

01:13:10.086 --> 01:13:13.890
two girls have been
taken and you don't know

01:13:15.191 --> 01:13:17.561
who's done that
and where they are.

01:13:17.594 --> 01:13:19.563
I'm gonna need a little
help here Detective White.

01:13:19.596 --> 01:13:21.765
This is my daughter.

01:13:21.798 --> 01:13:23.933
I have to find her right now.

01:13:23.967 --> 01:13:27.704
- Mr Lindstrom, I understand
that you're upset.

01:13:27.737 --> 01:13:30.474
You said that Regan had
a psychologist, right?

01:13:30.507 --> 01:13:31.775
- Yes, Dr. Tocaro.

01:13:31.808 --> 01:13:32.918
I spoke with her, she
said her sessions are

01:13:32.942 --> 01:13:34.478
confidential and
she's bound by law.

01:13:34.511 --> 01:13:36.813
- This is a child
abduction case.

01:13:36.846 --> 01:13:39.148
Confidentiality
no longer applies.

01:13:39.182 --> 01:13:41.084
Let's call the doctor.

01:13:44.588 --> 01:13:45.889
- Where are we going, Nate?

01:13:45.922 --> 01:13:47.423
- Someplace safe.

01:13:52.962 --> 01:13:54.898
- She talked
about a boy who admired her,

01:13:54.931 --> 01:13:58.201
he was older, but she
never gave me his name.

01:13:58.234 --> 01:13:59.869
- Can you remember anything else

01:13:59.903 --> 01:14:01.771
she may have
mentioned about him.

01:14:01.805 --> 01:14:03.039
- Let me check my notes.

01:14:03.072 --> 01:14:06.876
She said, she wanted
somebody to have a lot

01:14:06.910 --> 01:14:10.179
of money that worked
in a doctor's office.

01:14:11.848 --> 01:14:13.850
- So she wanted
to marry a doctor?

01:14:13.883 --> 01:14:15.828
- No, she didn't say that
she wanted to marry a doctor,

01:14:15.852 --> 01:14:18.163
she said very specifically that
she wanted to marry someone

01:14:18.187 --> 01:14:21.625
who worked in a doctor's
office or the medical field.

01:14:21.658 --> 01:14:22.892
- Right.

01:14:22.926 --> 01:14:24.594
Are you telling me
that she may have been

01:14:24.628 --> 01:14:26.195
describing her boyfriend?

01:14:26.229 --> 01:14:27.564
- It's possible.

01:14:27.597 --> 01:14:29.032
- Okay, is that it?

01:14:30.166 --> 01:14:32.902
- Yes, my notes stop there.

01:14:32.936 --> 01:14:34.704
Wait, wait, there's
one more thing.

01:14:34.738 --> 01:14:37.874
She showed me a key chain
that her boyfriend gave her.

01:14:37.907 --> 01:14:39.776
It was on her backpack.

01:14:47.717 --> 01:14:48.717
- Come on.

01:14:50.153 --> 01:14:51.120
Sit down!

01:14:51.154 --> 01:14:52.121
- Why are you doing this?

01:14:52.155 --> 01:14:53.590
- I can't trust you.

01:14:53.623 --> 01:14:55.291
They're brainwashing you!

01:14:55.324 --> 01:14:57.026
Trying to control you.

01:14:57.060 --> 01:14:58.728
- I'm really scared right now.

01:14:58.762 --> 01:14:59.963
- Don't be.

01:14:59.996 --> 01:15:01.230
Don't be scared.

01:15:01.264 --> 01:15:03.299
By tomorrow we're
gonna be so far away,

01:15:03.332 --> 01:15:04.868
so far from all of these people

01:15:04.901 --> 01:15:06.736
that are trying
to break us apart.

01:15:06.770 --> 01:15:08.204
- We can't just leave, Nate!

01:15:08.237 --> 01:15:11.140
I have my family, I have school.

01:15:11.174 --> 01:15:13.743
- What we have is so special.

01:15:13.777 --> 01:15:15.945
And we have to
fight to keep going,

01:15:15.979 --> 01:15:17.981
or they'll try to pull us apart.

01:15:18.014 --> 01:15:18.982
- What are you talking about?

01:15:19.015 --> 01:15:20.950
They won't keep us apart.

01:15:22.118 --> 01:15:23.286
- Yes they will.

01:15:24.621 --> 01:15:27.190
My family, your family,

01:15:27.223 --> 01:15:28.825
everybody will try
to break us apart.

01:15:28.858 --> 01:15:29.726
- No Nate!

01:15:29.759 --> 01:15:30.727
They will listen!

01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:33.262
- That's a lie, and you know it!

01:15:33.296 --> 01:15:35.231
Why are you trying
to protect them?

01:15:35.264 --> 01:15:36.766
- I'm not.

01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:38.277
- Do you really think
they're just gonna

01:15:38.301 --> 01:15:40.103
let us be together?

01:15:40.136 --> 01:15:41.204
Of course not.

01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:45.308
We have to get out
of here right now,

01:15:45.341 --> 01:15:47.844
or very soon, or they're
going to come here

01:15:47.877 --> 01:15:50.780
and I'm not going
to have a choice.

01:15:52.148 --> 01:15:53.148
- What?

01:16:03.059 --> 01:16:04.728
- Don't make a sound.

01:16:06.162 --> 01:16:07.740
- I think this is what
she was talking about.

01:16:07.764 --> 01:16:08.632
- That's it.

01:16:08.665 --> 01:16:09.599
That's the keychain.

01:16:09.633 --> 01:16:10.834
Mom has them at her clinic.

01:16:10.867 --> 01:16:12.344
They give them away
to the kids sometimes.

01:16:12.368 --> 01:16:13.679
- That's a major
coincidence unless that guy

01:16:13.703 --> 01:16:15.071
was actually down at the clinic.

01:16:15.104 --> 01:16:17.173
We've got to call Dr. Blockman.

01:16:17.206 --> 01:16:18.574
Come on.
- Yeah.

01:16:19.976 --> 01:16:21.978
- No.
- Don't make a sound.

01:16:31.287 --> 01:16:32.355
- Hello.

01:16:32.388 --> 01:16:33.657
- This is Det. White.

01:16:33.690 --> 01:16:34.924
We have the address on the

01:16:34.958 --> 01:16:36.301
credit card associated
with the GEM account.

01:16:36.325 --> 01:16:38.762
- Great, will you
please text that to me.

01:16:38.795 --> 01:16:42.298
- Mr. Lindstrom, we are gonna
have to follow up this lead.

01:16:42.331 --> 01:16:44.209
- Detective, this is my
daughter, every second counts,

01:16:44.233 --> 01:16:45.869
we both know that.

01:16:45.902 --> 01:16:47.346
- I'm sorry but this
is a police matter

01:16:47.370 --> 01:16:50.073
and we cannot officially
send you this address.

01:16:50.106 --> 01:16:51.675
I'll keep in touch.

01:16:53.877 --> 01:16:55.945
- Hey, it's from Mom.

01:16:55.979 --> 01:16:58.414
She says Nate quit today
so he's not in the office.

01:16:58.447 --> 01:16:59.859
I'm going to his
house to see if he's

01:16:59.883 --> 01:17:02.385
seen or heard from Regan.

01:17:02.418 --> 01:17:03.696
- Alright, so lets go
meet her at Nate's house.

01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:05.689
Call her for the address.

01:17:07.123 --> 01:17:09.693
- Hey it's Abby,
leave a message.

01:17:09.726 --> 01:17:10.794
- Voicemail.

01:17:10.827 --> 01:17:11.871
I'll call Dr. Blockman's office.

01:17:11.895 --> 01:17:13.096
They'll have it.

01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:25.140
- Hello?

01:17:35.451 --> 01:17:36.385
- Abby!

01:17:36.419 --> 01:17:37.787
What a surprise.

01:17:39.255 --> 01:17:41.057
- Nate.

01:17:41.090 --> 01:17:44.260
Hi, sorry, the door was open,
I tried knocking, but I just.

01:17:44.293 --> 01:17:46.238
I didn't know that you
heard me so I just kind of.

01:17:46.262 --> 01:17:47.931
- No, no, no, I didn't.

01:17:47.964 --> 01:17:48.932
Did you knock?

01:17:48.965 --> 01:17:50.466
I, how long have you been there?

01:17:50.499 --> 01:17:52.869
- A couple minutes, actually.

01:17:52.902 --> 01:17:55.939
I tried calling but I couldn't
get through on your phone so.

01:17:55.972 --> 01:17:57.082
- Yeah you know I've
been having a problem

01:17:57.106 --> 01:17:58.307
with the phone lately.

01:17:58.341 --> 01:18:00.209
I don't even know
what's going on.

01:18:00.243 --> 01:18:01.878
Are you here because
I quit today?

01:18:01.911 --> 01:18:04.881
I meant to say goodbye to
everyone but you know how it is.

01:18:04.914 --> 01:18:06.950
- Not at all, actually.

01:18:08.417 --> 01:18:10.787
Look, something really
terrible has happened to Regan

01:18:10.820 --> 01:18:12.989
and I just, I need your help.

01:18:14.157 --> 01:18:16.025
- Abby, what's going on?

01:18:21.397 --> 01:18:25.301
- Regan's been abducted
and I'm talking to everyone

01:18:26.836 --> 01:18:29.438
that knows her trying
to find any information

01:18:29.472 --> 01:18:31.808
that can help us find her.

01:18:31.841 --> 01:18:33.442
- Look, have you
talked to her friends?

01:18:33.476 --> 01:18:37.380
- Yes, I have literally talked
to everybody and nothing,

01:18:38.481 --> 01:18:40.149
so anything you can tell me.

01:18:40.183 --> 01:18:42.285
- I'm happy to help
in anyway I can.

01:18:42.318 --> 01:18:43.352
What can I do?

01:18:46.189 --> 01:18:50.126
- Unofficially, 1821 Darcy Lane.

01:18:50.994 --> 01:18:52.228
- Thank you Detective.

01:18:53.562 --> 01:18:54.907
Honey, listen, before
we meet your Mom,

01:18:54.931 --> 01:18:56.766
we're gonna stop by
this guys house, okay?

01:18:56.800 --> 01:18:57.967
When we get there,

01:18:58.001 --> 01:18:59.936
I want you to stay in the car.

01:18:59.969 --> 01:19:01.037
Just let me handle it.

01:19:01.070 --> 01:19:02.271
Got it?

01:19:02.305 --> 01:19:03.305
- Got it.

01:19:08.277 --> 01:19:09.145
Dad.

01:19:09.178 --> 01:19:10.446
- Yeah?

01:19:10.479 --> 01:19:12.148
- Look at this.

01:19:12.181 --> 01:19:13.793
The GEM address and Nate's
address are the same,

01:19:13.817 --> 01:19:14.984
1821 Darcy Lane.

01:19:16.085 --> 01:19:17.954
- Call and text your mother.

01:19:17.987 --> 01:19:18.987
Now!

01:19:24.060 --> 01:19:25.228
- If I hear anything, Abby,

01:19:25.261 --> 01:19:27.296
I will definitely call you.

01:19:27.330 --> 01:19:29.265
I'm so sorry about Regan.

01:19:35.839 --> 01:19:37.573
- Thanks, Nate.

01:19:37.606 --> 01:19:38.606
I really.

01:19:41.410 --> 01:19:44.147
- Mom don't go to
Nate's, we think he has Regan!

01:19:44.180 --> 01:19:46.315
The police are on the way.

01:19:50.486 --> 01:19:53.189
- I guess I should be going so.

01:20:05.301 --> 01:20:08.271
- You stay in this car until
the police arrive, okay?

01:20:08.304 --> 01:20:09.304
- Okay.

01:20:12.075 --> 01:20:13.376
- Lock the doors.

01:20:20.049 --> 01:20:21.250
- Nate, sorry to bother you.

01:20:21.284 --> 01:20:24.820
- No, no, I wish I
could of been more help.

01:20:26.089 --> 01:20:28.491
- You you going on a trip or?

01:20:35.899 --> 01:20:36.599
- Help!

01:20:36.632 --> 01:20:38.134
Help me!

01:20:38.167 --> 01:20:39.135
Somebody!

01:20:39.168 --> 01:20:40.469
Help!
- Regan!

01:20:40.503 --> 01:20:41.503
- Don't move.

01:20:42.671 --> 01:20:43.671
No.

01:20:45.942 --> 01:20:46.642
- Mom!

01:20:46.675 --> 01:20:47.675
- Regan!

01:20:48.945 --> 01:20:50.213
- Mom!

01:20:50.246 --> 01:20:51.147
- Are you okay?

01:20:51.180 --> 01:20:51.981
Are you okay?

01:20:52.015 --> 01:20:53.015
- Yes.

01:20:56.585 --> 01:20:57.386
- Abby!

01:20:57.420 --> 01:20:59.122
Regan!

01:20:59.155 --> 01:21:01.257
- Come on, come on, come on!

01:21:01.290 --> 01:21:02.158
Duck down.

01:21:02.191 --> 01:21:03.459
Get in the corner.

01:21:05.194 --> 01:21:06.495
Let's go, come on.

01:21:09.165 --> 01:21:10.165
Not a sound.

01:21:11.467 --> 01:21:12.501
- Okay.

01:21:12.535 --> 01:21:13.903
- Not a sound, shh, shh, shh!

01:21:13.937 --> 01:21:14.937
- Abby!

01:21:16.005 --> 01:21:17.005
Regan!

01:21:18.341 --> 01:21:19.341
- Abby!

01:21:20.343 --> 01:21:21.343
Regan!

01:21:22.445 --> 01:21:25.448
- Hey, it's
Abby, leave a message.

01:21:34.457 --> 01:21:35.457
- Abby!

01:21:36.592 --> 01:21:37.592
Regan!

01:21:44.367 --> 01:21:45.201
- No Nate!

01:21:45.234 --> 01:21:46.469
Please, no!

01:21:46.502 --> 01:21:47.703
Nate! No!

01:21:47.736 --> 01:21:48.571
Nate!

01:21:48.604 --> 01:21:49.604
No!

01:21:50.739 --> 01:21:52.375
- Abby!

01:21:52.408 --> 01:21:54.277
- Jim, he's got a gun.

01:21:55.444 --> 01:21:58.114
- Abby, where's, where's Regan?

01:22:01.417 --> 01:22:04.087
- She's okay, she's inside.

01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:06.055
- Neither of you
are gonna be fine.

01:22:06.089 --> 01:22:07.156
I'll make sure of that.

01:22:07.190 --> 01:22:08.391
Now put the crow bar!

01:22:08.424 --> 01:22:10.259
- No, no, no, no, no.

01:22:10.293 --> 01:22:13.696
- You're not gonna stop
me from seeing Regan.

01:22:13.729 --> 01:22:15.298
- You listen to me.

01:22:16.332 --> 01:22:18.201
No one's gotten hurt.

01:22:18.234 --> 01:22:20.569
You walk away right now,
you put that gun down.

01:22:20.603 --> 01:22:22.171
No harm done.

01:22:22.205 --> 01:22:23.139
- He's right.

01:22:23.172 --> 01:22:25.108
Nate, listen to me, just.

01:22:26.075 --> 01:22:27.543
- I don't know Jim.

01:22:28.511 --> 01:22:29.511
- Dad!

01:22:36.485 --> 01:22:38.221
- That was a really bad idea!

01:23:08.517 --> 01:23:09.517
- Thank you.

01:23:11.787 --> 01:23:13.489
My god Dad, are you okay?

01:23:13.522 --> 01:23:15.658
- Hey, I'm alright.

01:23:15.691 --> 01:23:17.526
It's okay, baby.

01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:19.228
Sanchez, call it in.

01:23:19.262 --> 01:23:20.529
We'll need paramedics.

01:23:20.563 --> 01:23:23.799
Barnes, secure the crime scene.

01:23:23.832 --> 01:23:25.201
- I can't believe
you're doing all

01:23:25.234 --> 01:23:27.070
the same stuff I'm
doing in chemistry.

01:23:27.103 --> 01:23:30.173
I mean, we learned this
unit like two weeks ago.

01:23:30.206 --> 01:23:33.409
- I love my new school so
much more than my old one.

01:23:33.442 --> 01:23:34.442
- Hey.

01:23:35.311 --> 01:23:37.480
Look what I just got today.

01:23:37.513 --> 01:23:40.683
- Wait, is that, is
that what I think it is?

01:23:40.716 --> 01:23:43.386
Is this your first check
as Executive Director?

01:23:43.419 --> 01:23:44.429
- Executive Director,
thats right.

01:23:44.453 --> 01:23:45.688
- So fancy.
- Bring it in.

01:23:45.721 --> 01:23:46.555
Bring it in.

01:23:46.589 --> 01:23:47.589
Thank you.

01:23:49.092 --> 01:23:52.228
And ladies, to celebrate,

01:23:52.261 --> 01:23:53.129
we're all going to the Bahamas.

01:23:53.162 --> 01:23:53.829
I just booked us a cruise.

01:23:53.862 --> 01:23:54.730
- What?

01:23:54.763 --> 01:23:56.632
- My God, dad really?

01:24:01.604 --> 01:24:03.539
- Can't even believe all
that we've been through?

01:24:03.572 --> 01:24:04.840
- I know.

01:24:04.873 --> 01:24:06.351
The important thing
is that Tara's safe

01:24:06.375 --> 01:24:09.478
and more important
than that, we are safe.

01:24:09.512 --> 01:24:10.513
- Yeah, true.

01:24:12.181 --> 01:24:14.150
- So, what do you think?

01:24:14.183 --> 01:24:15.484
- It's amazing!
- I'm excited!

01:24:15.518 --> 01:24:16.861
- You guys got to
share a room though!

01:24:16.885 --> 01:24:18.487
- What!

01:24:18.521 --> 01:24:20.099
- What do you mean, what!
- Dad, come on!

01:24:20.123 --> 01:24:21.133
- We're sharing a room, you
guys gotta share a room.

01:24:21.157 --> 01:24:22.358
That's how it works.

01:24:22.391 --> 01:24:23.292
- Of course you're
sharing a room.

01:24:23.326 --> 01:24:24.827
- We're too old for this.

01:24:24.860 --> 01:24:26.671
- It's got a view of the ocean
and a really small window.

01:24:26.695 --> 01:24:28.397
You're gonna love it.

01:24:28.431 --> 01:24:28.764
- It's a cruise,
of course it's the ocean!

01:24:28.797 --> 01:24:29.798
- I know.

01:24:29.832 --> 01:24:30.566
But you're gonna love it.

01:24:30.599 --> 01:24:31.634
It's gonna be great!
