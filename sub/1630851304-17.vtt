TO NOMINATE SARAH BETH.

12:54.034 --> 12:58.103
I KNOW ARE YOU FEELING IT.

12:58.137 --> 13:02.689
I DON'T KNOW WHY HE PICKED
ME.

13:02.724 --> 13:21.103
SHE WAS-- -- I KNOW THAT WE
HAVE-- I KNOW THAT WE HAVE TO

13:21.137 --> 13:22.655
LET PEOPLE GO.

13:22.689 --> 13:27.827
SO I KNOW THAT IT'S HARD THOUGH
WHEN LIKE IT'S PEOPLE WHO WE

13:27.862 --> 13:32.413
ACTUALLY FORMED TRUE, GENUINE
RELATIONSHIPS WITH.

13:32.448 --> 13:36.413
I'M JUST REALLY AFRAID AND
DREADING THE FACT THAT BRITINI

13:36.448 --> 13:37.896
MIGHT BE GOING HOME.

13:37.931 --> 13:40.689
HE DIDN'T HAVE TO WIN H.O.H.,
YOU KNOW.

13:40.724 --> 13:48.241
HE DIDN'T HAVE TO WIN IT TWNS WE
HAVE NUMBERS NOW.

13:48.275 --> 13:50.275
WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

13:50.310 --> 13:54.448
>>-- TOOK OUT TOGETHER IS ONE OF
THE TOUGHEST JOBS I'VE EVER HAD

13:54.482 --> 13:59.068
IN MY DAMN LIFE.

13:59.103 --> 14:00.655
IT DOESN'T EXPLAIN THE
PRESSURE.

14:00.689 --> 14:01.931
YOU OKAY.

14:01.965 --> 14:03.068
I WILL BE FINE, THANK YOU.

14:03.103 --> 14:08.448
TAKE A MOMENT.

14:08.482 --> 14:18.103
THANKS.

14:18.137 --> 14:24.413
DO WHAT IS BEST FOR YOU.

14:24.448 --> 14:45.517
BECAUSE GUESS WHAT,-- ANOTHER
THING-- EVERYBODY IS LIKE-- I'M

14:45.551 --> 14:56.379
JUST TELLING YOU, JUST BE SMART.

14:56.413 --> 15:05.724
BUT I THINK THAT THERE ARE THREE
POSSIBLE TARGETS.

15:05.758 --> 15:10.379
NUMBER ONE, NUMBER TWO, NUMBER
THREE BRITINI OR.

15:10.413 --> 15:12.551
I'M CONSIDERING ALL OPTIONS.

15:12.586 --> 15:15.896
CLAIRE IS ON THIS LIST BECAUSE
SHE IS A GREAT PLAYER, BRITINI

15:15.931 --> 15:20.448
PUT HERSELF IN A BAD SPOT BY
TARGETING ME FIRST DURING THIS

15:20.482 --> 15:22.551
LAST H.O.H. COMPETITION.

15:22.586 --> 15:27.448
AND ALYSSA IS OUTSIDE OF THE SIX
THAT I CAN SEND HOME WITHOUT

15:27.482 --> 15:29.448
DRAWING TOO MUCH SUSPICION.

15:29.482 --> 15:35.724
THIS H.O.H. IS DEFINITELY GOING
TO BE MUCH MORE CHALLENGING THAN

15:35.758 --> 15:38.896
MY LAST.

15:38.931 --> 15:44.413
WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT IS
THAT ONE OF US GETS IT TWNS I

15:44.448 --> 15:45.275
AGREE.

15:45.310 --> 15:55.206
I DIDN'T WANT HANNA TO GET
H.O.H.

15:55.241 --> 16:01.137
CLAIRE IS MY BEST FRIEND IN
THE HOUSE.

16:01.172 --> 16:05.172
THE PLAN FOR THE COOKOUT IS
BEGINNING TO BE MORE DIFFICULT

16:05.206 --> 16:08.448
BECAUSE THE LONGER YOU ARE IN
THIS HOUSE, THE MORE YOU START

16:08.482 --> 16:12.586
TO DEVELOP VERY STRONG PERSONAL
RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER PEOPLE

16:12.620 --> 16:13.862
IN THIS HOUSE.

16:13.896 --> 16:20.241
IT'S HARD FOR EMOTIONS TO NOT
GET INVOLVED AND CLOUD JUDGMENT.

16:20.275 --> 16:24.206
YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO
LEAVE WHO WE PUT TRUST IN.

16:24.241 --> 16:27.827
I STRUGGLE BECAUSE WE HAD
THESE OTHER RELATIONSHIPS THAT

16:27.862 --> 16:29.068
WE ARE BUILDING.

16:29.103 --> 16:36.413
AND SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO I
HAVE GROWN CLOSER TO, IF MY GAME

16:36.448 --> 16:38.344
IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT.

16:38.379 --> 16:43.793
I DON'T WANT ANYONE TO THINK
STAYING IN THIS HOUSE THAT OUR

16:43.827 --> 16:49.344
CONNECTION IS NOT REAL AND THAT
OUR RELATIONSHIP AREN'T REAL.

16:49.379 --> 16:52.413
IN MY HEART I KNOW WHAT WE HAVE
TO DO.

16:52.448 --> 16:55.551
IN MY MIND I KNOW WHAT WE HAVE
TO DO.

16:55.586 --> 16:58.310
WE HAVE ALREADY MADE HISTORY.

16:58.344 --> 17:09.620
WE JUST HAVE TO KEEP MAKING
HISTORY.

17:09.655 --> 17:12.448
HEY, CONGRATULATIONS.

17:12.482 --> 17:17.379
THANK YOU.

17:17.413 --> 17:18.137
WOW.

17:18.172 --> 17:19.068
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

17:19.103 --> 17:23.793
I'M OKAY.

17:23.827 --> 17:24.448
YEAH?

17:24.482 --> 17:26.517
ARE YOU SURE?

17:26.551 --> 17:28.275
I'M FINE.

17:28.310 --> 17:29.310
OKAY.

17:29.344 --> 17:32.827
I WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS THE
COMPETITION TODAY.

17:32.862 --> 17:33.620
YEAH.

17:33.655 --> 17:36.448
WHY DID YOU KEEP ON PICKING
ME?

17:36.482 --> 17:40.758
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW OF ANY
OTHER ALLIES THAT BRITINI HAS.

17:40.793 --> 17:49.137
OTHER ALLIES THAT SHE MIGHT
HAVE IS DEREK F BUT YOU PICKED

17:49.172 --> 17:50.000
ME.

17:50.034 --> 17:53.172
THAT IS WHAT IS LEFT OF THE
COOKOUT.

17:53.206 --> 17:58.103
SO WITH THAT, WHEN I'M IN THE
GAME AND TELLING EVERYONE HEY,

17:58.137 --> 18:02.758
THE OBVIOUS CHOICE, ANYONE WHO
ASKS ME IS OF A PERSON WHO PIX

18:02.793 --> 18:03.517
YOU.

18:03.551 --> 18:04.551
I DON'T WANT TO INTERRUPT
YOU.

18:04.586 --> 18:06.172
NO WORRIES.

18:06.206 --> 18:10.206
BUT I WOULD APPRECIATE TO
FEEL HEARD BEFORE YOU GO INTO

18:10.241 --> 18:12.482
LONG EXPLANATIONS BECAUSE THIS
IS MORE TURNING TOO AN INTERVIEW

18:12.517 --> 18:15.827
WHERE YOU ARE GIVING YOUR
EXPLANATIONS RATHER ME SPEAKING

18:15.862 --> 18:17.758
ON MY FEELINGS WHICH I WOULD
LIKE TO GET ACROSS.

18:17.793 --> 18:22.482
WHAT IF WE DROP THE ATTITUDE
ON BOTH OF OUR PARTS AND RESET.

18:22.517 --> 18:26.034
AND COME BACK TO THE
CONVERSATION WHERE WE ARE

18:26.068 --> 18:30.034
BRINGING GOOD INTENTIONS AND
GOOD WIL TO ACTUALLY DO THAT, IS

18:30.068 --> 18:34.034
THAT SOMETHING WE CAN AGREE TO
AND TRY TO DO.

18:34.068 --> 18:36.448
I'M FINE RESETTING.

18:36.482 --> 18:37.965
OKAY.

18:38.000 --> 18:42.482
BECAUSE THAT ISN'T IMPORTANT TO
ME.

18:42.517 --> 18:50.655
AZAH IS NOT A DWREAT
COMMUNICATOR WHEN IT COMES TO

18:50.689 --> 18:52.413
CONFRONTATION AND CONFLICT.

18:52.448 --> 18:55.896
KNOW I'M NOT YOUR ADVERSARY
AND MY INTENTIONS.

18:55.931 --> 19:00.379
I ASKED YOU TO THROW IT TO ME
AND X AGREED BUT WHEN WE WENT UP

19:00.413 --> 19:03.068
THERE YOU DIDN'T THROW IT HOW IT
COMES ACROSS TO ME, I FEEL LIKE

19:03.103 --> 19:12.482
IT IS PUTTING YOUR PERSONAL GAME
AHEAD OF YOUR ALLIANCE.

19:15.172 --> 19:16.379
>>.

19:16.413 --> 19:17.827
KYLAND IS BRINGING UP A LOT
OF THINGS AND IT LOOKS LIKE HE

19:17.862 --> 19:21.413
READ IN A BOOK SOMEWHERE, HOW TO
BE SUCCESSFUL IN 90 DAYS OR HOW

19:21.448 --> 19:26.448
TO BE A LEAD-- LEADER BUT I
THINK THE FEELINGS I HAVE ARE

19:26.482 --> 19:27.862
VALID BUT I'M NOT BEING HEARD.

19:27.896 --> 19:29.000
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME, I
SNOW LONG TIME

19:41.379 --> 19:42.724
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

19:42.758 --> 19:45.000
I'M DEFINITELY TIRED.

19:45.034 --> 19:46.000
YEAH?

19:46.034 --> 19:53.137
IT IS SO PIVOTAL.

19:53.172 --> 19:55.620
KYLAND AND I HAVEN'T REALLY
TALKED THAT MUCH GAME FOR THE

19:55.655 --> 19:59.758
PAST TWO WEEKS, SO I AM NOT
TOTALLY CONFIDENT WHO HIS

19:59.793 --> 20:00.931
TARGETS WILL BE THIS WEEK.

20:00.965 --> 20:02.275
AND I WOULD LOVE TO KNOW.

20:02.310 --> 20:07.862
HOW CAN I HELP YOU, KY?

20:07.896 --> 20:14.620
TO PUT UP WHO IS BEST FOR
YOUR GAME, I WILL VOTES HOW YOU

20:14.655 --> 20:15.379
WANT ME TO.

20:15.413 --> 20:16.965
YOU WILL GET THAT SUCKER OUT.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.206
THOSE ARE GREAT THINGS.

20:19.241 --> 20:23.724
I HAVE AN IDEA, I'M TRYING TO
FIGURE IT OUT.

20:23.758 --> 20:24.655
WHAT DO YOU FEEL.

20:24.689 --> 20:35.034
I MEAN I FEEL LIKE A JOCKER
AND-- YEAH.

20:35.068 --> 20:38.931
I WOULD LOVE SOMEONE THAT I
DON'T REALLY PERSONALLY WORK

20:38.965 --> 20:42.724
WITH GO HOME THIS WEEK.

20:42.758 --> 20:48.206
I'M TOSSING OUT AN X-ZAVIER TO
HIM, TOSSING OUT THE JOKERS, I

20:48.241 --> 20:53.000
MAY AS WELL TRY TO AIM HIS ARROW
FOR WHERE I WANT IT TO GO.

20:53.034 --> 20:55.827
I DON'T FEEL-- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT IS BEST FOR ME AT THIS

20:55.862 --> 20:57.413
MOMENT.

20:57.448 --> 20:59.172
CLAIRE, HOLD UP.

20:59.206 --> 21:03.896
I'M ASKING ABOUT TARGETS AND NOW
YOU NAMING COOKOUT MEMBERS?

21:03.931 --> 21:07.965
I'M NOT SURE HOW LONG WE CAN
ACTUALLY KEEP YOU AROUND NOW AM

21:08.000 --> 21:13.482
I KNOW WE GO BACK TO OUR DAYS AS
QUEENS BUT IF YOU ARE GOING TO

21:13.517 --> 21:15.862
TARGET THE COOKOUT, I MAY HAVE
TO TAKE YOU OUT SOONER RATHER

21:15.896 --> 21:18.517
THAN LATER.

21:18.551 --> 21:23.862
A GAME OF 52 CARD PICKUP IN
THE H.O.H. ROOM.

21:23.896 --> 21:26.862
SORRY, KY.

21:26.896 --> 21:27.586
WEEE.

21:27.620 --> 21:31.862
OH, THEY DIDN'T FALL ON YOU.

21:31.896 --> 21:35.862
THANK YOU.

21:35.896 --> 21:42.034
I CAN'T EVEN STAY TO BE
ENTERTAINED.

21:42.068 --> 21:43.827
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

21:43.862 --> 21:47.827
I'M STRUGGLING.

21:47.862 --> 21:48.379
OKAY.

21:48.413 --> 21:50.241
TELL ME WHAT TO DO.

21:50.275 --> 21:53.896
MY OPINION, OKAY, I
APPRECIATE IT.

21:53.931 --> 21:57.310
WHO IS BEST AND MOST
IMPORTANT, IF YOU ARE NOT OKAY,

21:57.344 --> 21:58.448
I'M INTO THE OKAY.

21:58.482 --> 22:05.068
WINNING H.O.H. IS DEVELOPMENT
GOOD FOR THE COOKOUT.

22:05.103 --> 22:07.862
HOWEVER WITH THE TOTAL NUMBER OF
PEOPLE IN THE HOUSE DWINDLE,

22:07.896 --> 22:11.896
FIGURING OUT WHO GOES ON THE
BLOCK BECOMES A BIT MORE OF A

22:11.931 --> 22:14.517
DIFFICULT DECISION ESPECIALLY
SINCE HAVE I NO IDEA WHO WILL

22:14.551 --> 22:18.551
HAVE POWERS FROM THE HIGH ROLLER
ROOM AND I DON'T WANT TO UP SET

22:18.586 --> 22:19.827
THE WRONG PEOPLE.

22:19.862 --> 22:24.413
NOW THAT I'M HERE I'M LIKE
WELL, I'M STILL WILLING TO-- BUT

22:24.448 --> 22:28.586
IF THERE ARE OPTIONS, NOT HAVING
TO TAKE SHOTS AT PERSON PEOPLE,

22:28.620 --> 22:33.379
I WOULD LIKE TO FIND THAT OPTION
BUT ONLY IF IT WORKS OUT FOR THE

22:33.413 --> 22:34.034
SIX.

22:34.068 --> 22:37.068
BRITINI IS SO DAMN LOST.

22:37.103 --> 22:38.793
I WOULDN'T EVEN WORRY.

22:38.827 --> 22:41.793
I AM NOT WORRIED ABOUT
BRITINI AT ALL.

22:41.827 --> 22:43.965
HERE CLAIRE IS ANOTHER ONE
POTENTIALLY.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.206
BUT CLAIRE IS MORE TRUSTING
FOR US.

22:46.241 --> 22:47.827
CORRECT.

22:47.862 --> 22:57.413
SO MY THING IS SOMEONE LIKE
ALYSSA OR DEFINITELY-- AND THE

22:57.448 --> 23:03.896
FACT THAT THERE IS-- WE HAVE TO
HAVE ONE THAT SAY PAWN OR

23:03.931 --> 23:04.206
WHATEVER.

23:04.241 --> 23:05.379
YEAH.

23:05.413 --> 23:08.172
AND THAT IS THE LAST THING
YOU WANT TO DO, YOU COULD

23:08.206 --> 23:15.103
POSSIBLY PUT SB AND MAKE HER A
PAWN.

23:15.137 --> 23:15.896
OKAY.

23:15.931 --> 23:17.965
NO, I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.

23:18.000 --> 23:22.000
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT.

23:22.034 --> 23:24.896
I'M THINKING ALYSSA.

23:24.931 --> 23:28.241
WOULD YOU RATHER SEE YOU OR
BRITINI NEXT TO HER.

23:28.275 --> 23:32.758
OH MY GOD, I CAN'T AFFORD TO
HAVE BRITSIN UP-- BRITINI UP

23:32.793 --> 23:33.482
THERE.

23:33.517 --> 23:41.034
IT IS CAN BE VERY EMOTIONAL.

23:41.068 --> 23:42.827
THAT IS THE MINE OF YOURS.

23:42.862 --> 23:45.103
IF CAN I GET SOMEONE I'M
WORKING WITH ALREADY TO

23:45.137 --> 23:50.241
VOLUNTEER TO GO UP AS A PAWN,
THIS WAY I ALSO HAVE LESS PEOPLE

23:50.275 --> 23:52.241
PPISSED AT ME AND CONSIDERING
THESE POWERS ARE COMING OUT, I

23:52.275 --> 23:57.724
FEEL LIKE THAT IS A GOOD THING.

23:57.758 --> 24:00.517
SO BASICALLY.

24:00.551 --> 24:11.793
OKAY.

24:11.827 --> 24:14.689
I'LL DO IT BNS I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME.

24:14.724 --> 24:17.896
I DON'T KNOW IF IT IS BECAUSE I
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH SLEEP BUT I'M

24:17.931 --> 24:23.724
GOING TO PUT MYSELF AS A PAWN,
TO PROTECT MY GIRLS, AND THAT

24:23.758 --> 24:27.344
WILL ALLOW HIM TO FIGURE OUT WHO
HE WANTS TO SEND HOME AND

24:27.379 --> 24:30.620
HOPEFULLY THIS WILL ACTUALLY
WORK OUT.

24:30.655 --> 24:37.482
I HAVE TO DO IT TWNS IF YOU
HAVE BRITINI UP THERE AGAIN, WE

24:37.517 --> 24:40.241
CAN'T HAVE AZAH UP THERE.

24:40.275 --> 24:42.172
NO, I HAVE TO.

24:42.206 --> 24:43.482
I WILL DO IT.

24:43.517 --> 24:44.482
IT'S FINE.

24:44.517 --> 24:48.000
IT WORKS OUT, IT'S FINE.

25:03.586 --> 25:06.689
HI, EVERYONE, TIME FOR THE
NOMINATION CEREMONY.

25:28.689 --> 25:32.448
THIS IS THE NOMINATION CEREMONY.

25:32.482 --> 25:36.103
IT IS MY RESPONSIBILITY AS THE
HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD TO NOMINATE

25:36.137 --> 25:38.793
TWO HOUSEGUESTS FOR EVICTION.

25:38.827 --> 25:43.620
IN MY NOM NATION BLOCK ARE THE
KEYS OF THE HOUSEGUESTS I'M

25:43.655 --> 25:45.241
NOMINATING FOR EVICTION.

25:45.275 --> 25:50.965
I WILL TURN TWO KEYS TO LOCK IN
MY NOMINATION AND THEIR FACES

25:51.000 --> 25:52.655
WILL APPEAR ON THE MEM ORE WALL.

25:52.689 --> 26:11.275
THE FIRST HOUSEGUEST HAVE I
NOMINATEED IS.

26:11.310 --> 26:28.689
THE NEXT HOUSEGUEST HAVE I
NOMINATED IS I HAVE NOMINATED

26:28.724 --> 26:34.103
YOU, CLAIRE, AND YOU DEREK F,
ACTIONS TAKEN DURING YESTERDAY'S

26:34.137 --> 26:38.586
HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD COMPETITION
CAUSED ME TO REEVALUATE MY

26:38.620 --> 26:42.172
POSITION IN THIS HOUSE.

26:42.206 --> 26:45.965
I WISH YOU BOTH THE BEST OF LUCK
IN VETO.

26:46.000 --> 26:55.689
THIS NOMINATION CEREMONY IS
ADJOURNED.

26:55.724 --> 26:59.689
I NOMINATE CLAIRE BECAUSE SHE
TOLD ME ALMOST ALL OF HER

26:59.724 --> 27:02.827
TARGETS, ARE OTHER MEMBERS OF
THE COOKOUT.

27:02.862 --> 27:07.379
AND I NOMINATED DEREK BECAUSE HE
OFFERED TO BE A PAWN.

27:07.413 --> 27:10.103
HE WANTS TO DO WHAT IS BEST
FOR THE GAME.

27:10.137 --> 27:13.517
KYLAND, WHAT ARE YOU DOING.

27:13.551 --> 27:17.793
I GO UP AT THE FIRST POSSIBLE
TIME I COULD.

27:17.827 --> 27:21.586
BY MY OWN FORMER TEAM MEMBER, AN
ALLY.

27:21.620 --> 27:25.517
THIS COULD BE A PLAN TO GET ME
OUT OF THE HOUSE.

27:25.551 --> 27:35.172
I NEED TO GET MYSELF OFF THE
BLOCK, SHOW, SOME WAY THIS WEEK.

27:35.206 --> 27:38.482
I'M OKAY.

27:38.517 --> 27:42.275
I'M NOT GOING TO LIE, I'M A
LITTLE SURPRISED AFTER THE

27:42.310 --> 27:47.034
EXCHANGE BETWEEN ME AND KYLAND
DURING OUR ONE-ON-ONE I KIND OF

27:47.068 --> 27:50.724
WAS CERTAIN I WOULD SEE ME UP ON
THE BLOCK, HAVING BIG D UP THERE

27:50.758 --> 27:56.103
IS JUST AS BAD BECAUSE HAVE I NO
IDEA WHAT IS GOING ON ON IN

27:56.137 --> 27:57.413
KYLAND'S MIND.

27:57.448 --> 27:59.620
LET'S HOPE AMERICA GAVE ME A
HUNDRED BUCKS SO I CAN WIN SOME

27:59.655 --> 28:02.551
DOLLARS AND CAN I JUST LOOK
PRETTY AND TAKE MY ASS OFF THE

28:02.586 --> 28:04.241
BLOCK OR SOMETHING.

28:04.275 --> 28:07.068
I'M NOT TELLING AZAH AND
BRITINI THAT I AM A PAWN BECAUSE

28:07.103 --> 28:09.931
THEY ARE NOT GOOD WITH THEIR
POKER FACE AND THEY ARE A LITTLE

28:09.965 --> 28:11.206
BIT TOO EMOTIONAL.

28:11.241 --> 28:14.586
