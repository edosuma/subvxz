[door bangs]

00:10.844 --> 00:11.845
Who's out there?

00:15.348 --> 00:16.474
I got a gun!

00:17.976 --> 00:19.019
This is America.

00:19.394 --> 00:20.603
We all got guns.

00:23.148 --> 00:24.274
Mr. Peterson!

00:25.358 --> 00:26.568
What are you doing here?

00:26.651 --> 00:28.737
A quick question, Colt.

00:29.487 --> 00:31.823
I'm a bit fuzzy,
what with the brain tumor and all,

00:31.906 --> 00:34.701
but... before I went to Thailand,

00:35.118 --> 00:37.328
did I burn my house down
for the insurance money?

00:37.787 --> 00:38.955
[scoffs] No.

00:39.372 --> 00:40.707
No, there was a wildfire.

00:41.207 --> 00:42.959
Actually, I got some pictures here.

00:44.252 --> 00:45.170
[laughs] Well...

00:45.253 --> 00:47.797
I got of Chris Pine to show to my barber.

00:50.300 --> 00:51.676
Handsome son of a bitch.

00:53.636 --> 00:55.180
Err... There it is.

00:55.472 --> 00:57.474
There's your house burning down.

00:58.183 --> 00:59.434
Oh, Jesus!

01:00.852 --> 01:02.896
I lived in this place for 50 years.

01:04.355 --> 01:06.649
My wife's ashes were right over there.

01:08.443 --> 01:09.986
Sorry about that. I wish I...

01:10.820 --> 01:12.322
Would've known before I cleaned up.

01:13.156 --> 01:14.657
You can check my Shop-Vac.

01:16.201 --> 01:17.410
That's fine.

01:18.495 --> 01:21.498
Kinda ironic,
since she'd never fucking vacuum.

01:24.167 --> 01:26.711
I tell you, despite everything,
it's great to see you.

01:27.253 --> 01:28.922
We all thought you were...

01:29.172 --> 01:30.006
Dead.

01:30.715 --> 01:31.549
Nope!

01:31.758 --> 01:33.802
I heard the worst word

01:34.177 --> 01:36.262
that a man with cancer can hear

01:36.721 --> 01:38.306
after he spent all his money.

01:39.265 --> 01:40.100
Remission.

01:41.559 --> 01:42.435
Oh.

01:43.269 --> 01:44.562
Well, tell you what,

01:44.646 --> 01:47.398
look at the bright side,
I'm sure you caught something

01:47.482 --> 01:50.360
from one of your ladies in Bangkok,
that'll kill you.

01:50.735 --> 01:51.653
Could be.

01:52.362 --> 01:53.655
I took a piss in the airport,

01:53.905 --> 01:56.074
damn near burned a hole in the urinal.

01:58.034 --> 01:59.536
So, you living here now?

02:00.161 --> 02:00.995
Yeah.

02:01.204 --> 02:04.124
I rebuilt the place
after me and Abby got married.

02:04.332 --> 02:06.167
Congratulations!

02:06.459 --> 02:07.335
She left me.

02:08.253 --> 02:09.087
Oh.

02:10.130 --> 02:11.923
That why you're sleeping in a tent?

02:12.006 --> 02:14.968
Nope. No, I just don't wanna see my dad.

02:15.552 --> 02:16.845
Well, how about the herd?

02:16.970 --> 02:18.555
You get a good price at market?

02:18.638 --> 02:19.472
No.

02:20.014 --> 02:22.142
No. I didn't sell any of them.

02:22.433 --> 02:25.228
I gambled wrong and prices crashed, so...

02:25.478 --> 02:26.938
Oh... God!

02:27.522 --> 02:29.190
You and Rooster gonna make it?

02:29.858 --> 02:32.152
No. No.

02:34.237 --> 02:35.738
Rooster's... dead.

02:35.822 --> 02:38.283
[stutters] He had a motorcycle accident.

02:39.742 --> 02:40.702
I'm sorry.

02:41.786 --> 02:42.871
He was a good kid.

02:42.954 --> 02:44.914
I know. He was a good one.

02:45.748 --> 02:46.583
So...

02:46.916 --> 02:49.294
you running this place alone then, huh?

02:49.544 --> 02:50.378
Nope.

02:50.545 --> 02:52.922
No. I partnered up with my cousin.

02:53.423 --> 02:55.133
Well, that's good news, eh?

02:55.425 --> 02:56.259
Nope.

02:58.136 --> 03:01.097
Couple weeks ago, he ran off
with Rooster's ex and all the money.

03:01.639 --> 03:02.473
God!

03:03.516 --> 03:05.143
Your life blows.

03:06.477 --> 03:07.312

What are you doing? I gotta get to work.

04:22.136 --> 04:24.514
Yeah, well, you put a lot of miles
on your van

04:24.597 --> 04:27.267

04:37.652 --> 04:39.445
Well, I appreciate the help,

04:40.154 --> 04:42.448
but you've had an excuse
to be here every day.

04:42.740 --> 04:45.243

for texting so much.

I promise, no more
unannounced drop-bys, alright?

04:56.963 --> 04:58.047
I just want you to know...

04:59.465 --> 05:01.259
I'm a good father and husband.

05:03.177 --> 05:04.762
Actually, speaking of...

05:10.351 --> 05:13.980

for the ranch, okay?

Where'd you even get this?

05:26.909 --> 05:28.202
Like I turned a corner.

05:29.454 --> 05:32.582
I sold a couple of heifers to buy a bull
to impregnate the rest of the herd.

05:34.083 --> 05:36.502
Negotiated the shit outta the deal
and that's what's left over.

06:04.030 --> 06:05.406
Yeah, you know my parents.

06:05.490 --> 06:07.283
It's just hard living back at home.

06:07.867 --> 06:10.536
Tell me about it.
That's why I moved into my own tent.

06:11.120 --> 06:14.290
My mom keeps telling me
how much I'm messing up Peyton's life.

06:14.374 --> 06:16.834
"That's not the way you hold her.
That's not how you feed her."

06:16.959 --> 06:19.045
Well, Mom, I could raise her
how you raised me,

06:19.128 --> 06:21.714
then she'd grow up hating me
for being a fucking know-it-all.

06:23.007 --> 06:24.801

06:33.684 --> 06:34.685
Hey! Err...

06:34.936 --> 06:38.314
You know, if it helps,
you could move into the hunting cabin.

06:39.148 --> 06:41.025
[chuckles] No, I don't think
that's a good idea.

06:41.109 --> 06:42.360
It'll be your own space.

06:42.985 --> 06:43.986
I won't bother you.

06:44.570 --> 06:46.155
Further away from your parents,

06:46.322 --> 06:47.240
closer to school.

06:47.865 --> 06:49.534
Be easier to trade out Peyton.

06:50.076 --> 06:51.702
You'd stop showing up for no reason?

06:52.662 --> 06:53.538
Yeah.

06:53.704 --> 06:56.707
It'd be just like the NFL combine
after they sent that letter

06:56.791 --> 06:59.752
telling me unless I was officially
invited, I had to stay off the property.

07:00.795 --> 07:03.881
You went to the combine.
You wore a fake beard and mustache...

07:03.965 --> 07:05.591
No. That wasn't me.

10:12.320 --> 10:13.779
Alright. Look, Heather...

10:15.031 --> 10:16.532
I don't wanna upset you, but...

10:17.742 --> 10:19.118
your mom's a drug addict.

10:19.327 --> 10:20.411
Where do you get off?

10:20.494 --> 10:22.246

10:30.713 --> 10:31.964

Honestly, I don't give a shit
about either of them,

10:34.216 --> 10:37.261

from my mom to buy drugs.

-No. Thanks, Colt.

You can't.

His breeding days are over.

11:05.247 --> 11:07.083
How am I supposed
to get my heifers pregnant?

11:07.500 --> 11:10.503
Well, there's always
artificial insemination.

11:10.836 --> 11:14.173
If I could afford that,
I wouldn't have had to buy a shitty bull.

11:17.218 --> 11:20.554
The worst part of being a vet
is telling people bad news.

11:21.180 --> 11:22.014
Heather...

11:22.973 --> 11:24.517
I've got a new job for you.

11:30.314 --> 11:32.441
I want to hear all about Thailand, Sam.

11:32.817 --> 11:34.318
I'm so jealous you got to go.

11:34.819 --> 11:37.780
I cooked curry once
and Beau threw away the Crock-Pot.

11:39.657 --> 11:42.368
Nothing we cooked in it
ever tasted right again.

11:43.703 --> 11:47.707
In Bangkok,
I ate dessert out of a monkey's skull.

11:49.458 --> 11:50.292
By the way,

11:50.960 --> 11:52.795
this pie is delicious.

11:52.878 --> 11:54.964
-Hey, Colt.
-Hey.

11:56.215 --> 11:57.216
What do you want?

11:58.843 --> 12:02.138
I wanna shower and get some clean clothes,
if it's alright with you.

12:05.224 --> 12:06.058
Joanne.

12:06.600 --> 12:07.435
Peterson.

12:11.647 --> 12:12.982
I forgot to ask.

12:13.607 --> 12:15.317
How are things with you and Colt?

12:16.777 --> 12:17.737
We're not talking.

12:18.654 --> 12:20.489
Kinda where I hope you and I will end up.

12:23.325 --> 12:25.578
What the hell is
Neumann's Hill doing here?

12:25.995 --> 12:26.829
I don't know.

12:27.455 --> 12:30.708
A lot of people want to talk
to a lot of people for a lot of reasons.

12:31.751 --> 12:33.294
What the fuck does that mean?

12:34.754 --> 12:36.547
-Hey, Lisa.
-Joanne. Gentlemen.

12:36.630 --> 12:39.008
You know Sam, right?
He used to own the ranch next door.

12:39.091 --> 12:40.718
Oh, yeah. Sam and I know each other.

12:41.510 --> 12:42.887
He agreed to sell me his ranch

12:42.970 --> 12:45.431
and then pulled out
with a very colorful e-mail.

12:45.514 --> 12:47.099
Apparently, I'm a "cooksucker."

12:49.101 --> 12:50.603
Always proofread, Sam.

12:52.021 --> 12:53.564
I'll resend it if you like.

12:54.982 --> 12:57.109
Sam, how about you help me do the dishes?

12:57.651 --> 12:59.528
What? We're gonna leave now?

13:00.154 --> 13:02.782
Right before Beau gets yelled at
by his lady boss?

13:08.454 --> 13:10.122
He's supposed to be dead by now.

13:11.707 --> 13:12.833
What can I do for you?

13:13.083 --> 13:14.585
I just came by to let you know

13:14.668 --> 13:16.754
we've got some bulls coming in
for the heifers.

13:16.837 --> 13:18.923
We artificially inseminate here.

13:19.006 --> 13:21.884
You know, you can't argue with me
over every decision.

13:21.967 --> 13:22.802
Disagree.

13:24.428 --> 13:27.014
We are trying to improve the bloodline
of your herd.

13:27.890 --> 13:30.142
Now, I invested a lot of money
in those bulls.

13:30.434 --> 13:32.853
If you draft John Elway,
don't put him on the bench.

13:33.312 --> 13:35.481
You show up with John Elway,
we'll talk.

13:37.441 --> 13:39.318
Beau, I run a lot of ranches.

13:39.985 --> 13:43.072
And we have a system
that's proven to be pretty successful.

13:43.322 --> 13:46.075
I promise you,
you will be very happy with the results.

13:46.534 --> 13:49.203
Bring them. I'll have Dale check them out.

13:49.411 --> 13:51.455
Beau, you know we have our own vets.

13:51.539 --> 13:52.456
And I have mine.

13:52.915 --> 13:55.125
You know,
the last time I saw you two together,

13:55.209 --> 13:57.586
you told him he was the worst vet
you'd ever met

13:57.670 --> 14:01.257
and that you hoped he'd drive
his truck into a ditch on the way home.

14:01.340 --> 14:02.508
And I like him.

14:03.717 --> 14:05.553
Think how I'm gonna treat your vets.

14:08.138 --> 14:09.598
We are paying our own vets,

14:09.974 --> 14:11.600
and I am not about to pay extra,

14:11.684 --> 14:13.853
so that you can have Dale
do the same job.

14:13.936 --> 14:15.604
That's not how you run a business.

14:15.729 --> 14:18.399
I thought we agreed
that I'm still running this ranch.

14:18.649 --> 14:19.608
You are,

14:19.775 --> 14:22.778
but there are certain decisions
that are out of your hands.

14:22.862 --> 14:23.863
Says who?

14:23.946 --> 14:25.823
Says the contract you signed.

14:28.117 --> 14:28.993
Fine.

14:30.119 --> 14:31.203
I'll talk to Dale.

14:32.121 --> 14:35.457
But there's nothing in that contract
says I have to talk to you.

14:49.138 --> 14:49.972
[gunshot]

14:50.389 --> 14:54.184
The fact we picked this for our honeymoon
or that they offer a package for it.

14:54.476 --> 14:58.397
It's certainly not my first time shooting
a machine gun in a wedding dress.

14:58.564 --> 15:01.609
Though this time I won't have to throw
my gun in the lake when the police come.

15:02.651 --> 15:05.654
Well, I got us something special
for our big day.

15:05.738 --> 15:08.741
Champagne! I never get to drink this.

15:08.824 --> 15:11.911
I usually just get sprayed with it
when I visit Darlene at work.

15:12.286 --> 15:15.080
I wasn't sure about bringing it in,
but I thought, "What they gonna do?

15:15.164 --> 15:17.625
-We have fucking machine guns."
-[chuckles] Right?

15:18.042 --> 15:19.960
I brought you a little something, too.

15:20.044 --> 15:21.045
[pills rattle]

15:21.211 --> 15:22.755
[Luke] Ooh. Wow!

15:22.963 --> 15:26.467
Okay. Well I hope it's not too soon
to say this, but... I love you.

15:27.468 --> 15:28.302
Come on.

15:28.886 --> 15:31.889
You're not gonna get all clingy
just 'cause we're married, are you?

Alright! Game on!

[phone beeps]

15:38.646 --> 15:40.606
Ugh! It's my daughter Heather!

15:41.190 --> 15:43.025
She's worried I'm making bad decisions.

15:43.275 --> 15:44.151
[Luke] What?!

15:44.568 --> 15:46.570
We've made nothing but great decisions.

15:46.820 --> 15:47.863

16:05.172 --> 16:06.966

16:07.049 --> 16:09.843
where you feel like
nothing's ever gonna get any better?

16:10.260 --> 16:11.095
No.

16:11.637 --> 16:12.596
I'm a dreamer.

16:15.057 --> 16:15.891
Thanks.

16:17.101 --> 16:18.102
Hey, Colt.

16:18.602 --> 16:20.854
Hey, Lisa. Come on.

16:21.271 --> 16:22.648
Thanks for meeting with me.

16:23.232 --> 16:24.191
Of course.

16:25.401 --> 16:28.779
You've seen my office so many times,
it's nice to finally see yours.

16:29.238 --> 16:30.072
Hey, you joke,

16:30.155 --> 16:33.367
but has your office got
a cologne/condom machine in it?

16:34.034 --> 16:35.661
No, but then again,

16:35.744 --> 16:39.873
I don't have Honky Tonk Badonkadonk
playing during business meetings either.

16:41.458 --> 16:42.292
So...

16:42.835 --> 16:44.420
how much do you want for your ranch?

16:45.671 --> 16:47.047
Hmm. Alright.

16:48.048 --> 16:49.341
I'll be honest with you.

16:49.425 --> 16:52.803
I ain't selling my ranch. I just knew
after the last time we talked,

16:52.886 --> 16:54.513
it was the only way
I'd get you to meet me.

16:54.596 --> 16:56.890
Jesus, Colt,
you know I don't have time for this.

16:56.974 --> 16:58.809
Yeah, I know, I know, I know.
I'm sorry.

16:58.892 --> 17:01.770
But I...
Reason I want to talk to you is...

17:03.355 --> 17:05.107
I want to buy one of your bulls.

17:05.482 --> 17:07.693
[scoffs] Okay. Err...

17:08.277 --> 17:11.321
I can talk to my guys.
I'm sure we can figure something out.

17:11.405 --> 17:12.281
Great. Alright.

17:12.364 --> 17:15.868
You tell your guys that I'll pay for it
in the spring... ish.

17:17.494 --> 17:19.663
So, you want to buy a bull with no money.

17:20.789 --> 17:23.625
Hmm. Do you have any magic beans, Colt?

17:25.252 --> 17:27.504
If I had magic beans,
think I'd be here talking to you?

17:29.423 --> 17:31.759
Look, no, I'm up against it here.

17:31.842 --> 17:32.676
Alright?

17:33.218 --> 17:35.429
And... I talked to every rancher
I ever met,

17:35.512 --> 17:38.307
but ain't nobody got an operation
big enough to give up a bull.

17:38.557 --> 17:39.391
Except...

17:40.225 --> 17:41.101
you.

17:41.643 --> 17:43.062
You know, I like you, Colt.

17:43.771 --> 17:45.731
And I don't want you to fail, but...

17:46.523 --> 17:48.609
the fact is, we are competitors.

17:48.984 --> 17:51.737
So, if you do go under,
it'll be good for me.

17:52.321 --> 17:55.616
Yeah, but I... [stuttering]
If this situation was reversed,

17:55.741 --> 17:57.159
I'd help you out.

17:57.242 --> 17:58.952
And in fact, I did.

17:59.036 --> 18:01.705
After the wildfire,
you needed a place for your cattle.

18:01.789 --> 18:03.832
No. You didn't help me, your father did.

18:03.957 --> 18:05.667
And I paid him for it.

He's got eight heifers in estrus,

from your dad's ranch.

Sure, as long as your guys don't mind
being shot for trespassing.

22:24.217 --> 22:26.136
The only reason I've not called the police

22:26.219 --> 22:28.430
is because of my relationship
with your father.

22:29.306 --> 22:31.141
Now, if I don't get that bull back,

22:31.224 --> 22:33.769
the next visit you get
is not gonna be from me.

22:35.228 --> 22:37.272
The only one breaking the law here...

22:37.856 --> 22:38.690
is you.

22:39.524 --> 22:41.193
You're trespassing on my property,

22:41.276 --> 22:43.070
so why don't you get the hell out?

22:43.362 --> 22:45.781
Hey. Am I interrupting something?

22:47.449 --> 22:48.325
No.

22:49.076 --> 22:50.202
Lisa was just leaving.

22:54.122 --> 22:56.083
-Good to see you, Abby.
-Yeah, you too.

22:58.335 --> 23:00.379
-She was--
-I don't even want to know.

23:00.629 --> 23:01.505
[Colt] Yeah.

23:01.922 --> 23:02.881
I don't blame you.

23:03.173 --> 23:04.341
Hey, here.

23:08.011 --> 23:09.388
Think about that hunting cabin?

23:09.721 --> 23:11.848
-[chuckling] Cozy interiors...
-[Abby laughs]

23:12.015 --> 23:13.141
...panoramic view.

23:13.767 --> 23:15.769
Baby-locks on everything,
except for the gun cabinet.

23:15.852 --> 23:18.980
You need a gun quick, you can't be
fucking around with a baby-lock, right?

23:21.149 --> 23:22.901
It's actually why I stopped by.

23:23.610 --> 23:25.320
I really want to move
into the hunting cabin.

23:25.404 --> 23:27.072
Great! Stop talking.

23:27.155 --> 23:28.115
[chuckles]

23:29.825 --> 23:31.576
But in order for me to do that...

23:33.495 --> 23:35.163
I feel like I gotta trust you again.

23:35.455 --> 23:36.289
And...

23:37.791 --> 23:39.251
I'm just not there yet.

23:40.502 --> 23:43.630
And I can't get there living in
your backyard and seeing you all the time.

23:46.925 --> 23:47.759
Right.

23:49.511 --> 23:51.638
So you gonna stay living
with your parents?

23:51.721 --> 23:53.265
No. They're driving me nuts.

23:53.890 --> 23:54.724
So...

23:57.727 --> 23:59.062
I got an apartment.

24:02.899 --> 24:04.359
-An apartment?
-[softly] Yeah.

24:06.486 --> 24:07.446
No.

24:08.697 --> 24:10.532
I know it's not what you wanna hear.

24:10.615 --> 24:13.743
You're gonna pay to live someplace
further away from me,

24:13.827 --> 24:15.287
instead of the hunting cabin.

24:16.455 --> 24:18.874
This is already so hard. Okay?

24:20.625 --> 24:23.462
It'd only be worse
if I had to come home every night,

24:23.545 --> 24:24.963
and drive up the road,

24:25.630 --> 24:27.591
past your truck, past our house,

24:28.717 --> 24:31.678
knowing you're in there,
knowing I want to be in there, too.

24:32.137 --> 24:35.640
Okay? It'll tear me apart,
and I already feel like I'm going crazy.

24:36.850 --> 24:37.976
I'm going crazy.

24:39.311 --> 24:40.937
My wife left me.

24:41.771 --> 24:43.773
And you took my daughter from me.

24:44.941 --> 24:46.860
My whole life is falling apart,

24:47.235 --> 24:48.653
and I dunno how to fix it.

24:49.279 --> 24:50.113
I know.

24:50.739 --> 24:52.616
I know! I'm sorry.

24:53.116 --> 24:54.159
-Okay?
-Don't.

25:09.382 --> 25:10.258
Abby?

25:11.676 --> 25:12.719
[door taps]

25:13.345 --> 25:14.888
[whispers loudly] Ab-by!

25:16.765 --> 25:19.601
Colt! Come on,
it's the middle of the night!

25:20.060 --> 25:21.811
-Are you drunk?
-Nah...

25:21.895 --> 25:23.772
-Oh my God...
-[slurring] Yeah.

25:24.064 --> 25:24.898
Yeah.

25:26.107 --> 25:27.317
I need a ride home.

25:27.400 --> 25:28.777
-My God!
-Grab your stuff.

25:28.985 --> 25:31.154
-Oh! Bring the baby.
-Colt!

25:31.530 --> 25:34.074
Come on! I'm not talking to you
when you're like this.

25:34.157 --> 25:36.201
You keep asking how you can fix
our relationship.

25:36.284 --> 25:37.160
Well, not like this!

25:37.410 --> 25:39.496
Abby, come on. Abby!

25:40.830 --> 25:41.790
[shouts] Abby!

25:44.960 --> 25:47.045
Colt, I think Abby's made it pretty clear

25:47.128 --> 25:48.588
she doesn't wanna talk right now.

25:48.672 --> 25:50.090
With all due respect, sir...

25:50.882 --> 25:51.841
blow me.

25:53.593 --> 25:55.554
Yeah, I think I need to drive you home.

25:55.637 --> 25:57.347
[slurring] I think I need to talk to Abby.

25:58.139 --> 25:59.140
Just stop, Colt.

25:59.224 --> 26:02.060
-I'm just... Don't touch me.
-You need to take a breath, son.

26:02.143 --> 26:04.187
-Okay. I'm just gonna talk to her.
-Colt.

26:04.271 --> 26:05.981
I said don't fucking touch me!

26:09.401 --> 26:11.278
Okay. Settle down, cowboy.

26:11.486 --> 26:12.320
[Colt] I...

26:12.654 --> 26:13.530
[Chuck] You done?

26:14.197 --> 26:15.699
[Colt] I... Do you give?

26:17.742 --> 26:18.577
[Chuck] Yeah.

26:19.452 --> 26:20.287
Here.

26:20.579 --> 26:22.581
[Colt groans]

26:28.169 --> 26:30.171
[coughs]

26:32.340 --> 26:33.174
Fuck!

26:33.925 --> 26:34.843
You alright?

26:35.635 --> 26:36.595
I'm not great.

26:38.638 --> 26:39.472
I'm drunk.

26:41.516 --> 26:42.976
On my wife's parents' porch.

26:44.269 --> 26:45.770
And I just beat up her dad.

26:48.148 --> 26:50.358
[scoffs] Well, you're drunk on my porch.

26:51.901 --> 26:53.278
Give me a sip of that beer.

26:54.779 --> 26:55.905
[owl hoots]

26:58.825 --> 27:00.035
I don't know what to do.

27:02.871 --> 27:03.830
[sighs]

27:04.247 --> 27:05.373
I know you're hurting.

27:06.916 --> 27:08.668
And I know you love Abby.

27:12.881 --> 27:13.757
[quietly] Yeah...

27:14.841 --> 27:16.843
Come on. Let's get you home.

27:20.430 --> 27:21.598
[Colt groans]

27:22.932 --> 27:24.184
-Chuck.
-Yeah?

27:35.945 --> 27:37.989
Hey! Mrs. Matthews, you hungry?

27:38.615 --> 27:41.117
I think I can Indiana Jones us
some M&amp;M's.

27:46.539 --> 27:47.540
Shit! Didn't get it.

27:48.124 --> 27:49.918
Well, 17 bucks down the drain.

27:51.127 --> 27:52.879
Oh, and they're peanut. Fantastic.

27:54.172 --> 27:55.006
Want some?

27:56.508 --> 27:57.384
Hey, Mary?

27:59.678 --> 28:00.512
Hey, Mary!

28:01.846 --> 28:02.722
Mary, hey!

28:02.847 --> 28:04.891
Hey, Mary! Mary! Mary!

28:13.525 --> 28:14.818
-Hey.
-Hey.

28:21.408 --> 28:23.952
I found Lisa Neumann's bull
over on my property.

28:24.494 --> 28:25.370
Is that right?

28:25.954 --> 28:26.788
Yeah.

28:28.123 --> 28:30.500
One of the gates
between our ranches was left open,

28:30.583 --> 28:32.377
but I swear I had nothing to do with it.

28:32.627 --> 28:33.503
I believe you.

28:34.379 --> 28:36.798
-Really?
-Yeah! Anything could've happened.

28:37.549 --> 28:39.217
Hell, maybe I left the gate open.

28:40.552 --> 28:42.637
You never left the gate open in 70 years.

28:44.180 --> 28:45.390
Maybe I'm slipping.

28:46.725 --> 28:48.226
But I guess it's good timing,

28:48.309 --> 28:50.437
since you're having trouble
with your bull.

28:54.733 --> 28:55.817
-Dad...
-Hey!

28:57.026 --> 28:59.154
I don't know how that bull got over there.

29:00.447 --> 29:02.323
But I'm glad my son caught a break.

29:20.091 --> 29:20.925
I...

29:21.676 --> 29:22.510
Yeah?

29:24.429 --> 29:25.263
Thank you.

29:30.560 --> 29:31.561
It was you, right?

29:36.024 --> 29:38.026
[mellow country music]
