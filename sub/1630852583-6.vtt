02:23.396 --> 02:25.098
- Hey.
- What have you got?

02:25.198 --> 02:27.199
I found this
really unusual rock.

02:29.001 --> 02:29.982
Kind of looks like an animal.

02:30.082 --> 02:32.704
Oh yeah, I can kinda see that.

02:32.804 --> 02:34.806
Sort of looks like a rock.

02:41.771 --> 02:43.433
- Hey.

02:43.533 --> 02:45.875
Hey.

02:45.975 --> 02:47.176
What if we were to hold off

02:47.276 --> 02:49.397
telling Emma about
the other thing for now?

02:49.497 --> 02:51.600
Oh, I'm so glad you said that.

02:51.700 --> 02:54.041
Seriously, the stress of it and
the baby has been killing me.

02:54.141 --> 02:56.363
Yeah, I could tell.
Hey, Em, come on!

02:56.463 --> 02:57.924
We gotta get
going on the road, alright?

02:58.024 --> 02:59.566
Wait - 'stress of the baby'.

02:59.666 --> 03:02.068
You're not having doubts,
are you?

03:04.510 --> 03:06.511
Come on, babe. Careful.

03:10.554 --> 03:12.696
Will you come
to dinner tonight?

03:12.796 --> 03:14.778
Oh, sweetie,
I'm sorry, I can't.

03:14.878 --> 03:16.590
How come?

03:16.600 --> 03:18.501
I have to go to
a friend's birthday party.

03:18.601 --> 03:20.543
Oh.

03:20.643 --> 03:24.426
OK.

03:24.526 --> 03:25.947
- Home time!
- Yay! Let's go!

03:26.047 --> 03:28.048
Yeah.

03:36.295 --> 03:39.118
- Are you joking?
- Shit.

03:39.218 --> 03:40.979
- Don't joke.
- Why would I joke
about something like that?

03:41.000 --> 03:43.401
- What does it say?
- It's the battery.

03:43.501 --> 03:46.724
- Call the RAA.
- Right! Good idea, babe.

03:46.824 --> 03:50.246
I'll call the RAA. They'll send
someone out here in no time.

03:50.346 --> 03:52.288
- Damn.
- Wait, I don't even
have any reception.

03:52.388 --> 03:54.030
Neither do I. It's OK.

03:54.130 --> 03:56.652
Please don't tell me it's OK
until you know it's OK.

03:56.752 --> 03:58.974
Look, if somebody comes out
here, they can jump-start us.

03:59.074 --> 04:01.076
If somebody comes out here?
Who's coming out here?

04:01.176 --> 04:03.697
We were here all day yesterday
and nobody came here.

04:03.797 --> 04:06.800
So stupid.

04:06.900 --> 04:09.383
- Alright. Alright. Look...
- I've got no reception at all.
I don't even have a bar.

04:09.483 --> 04:12.124
I can go to the top of
that hill, see if there's
any reception out there.

04:12.204 --> 04:13.966
Em, stay in the car with Mary.
I'll be right back.

04:14.066 --> 04:16.568
- That's miles away.
- It's fine. Just stay here.

04:22.893 --> 04:24.894
Everything's going to be fine.

04:42.629 --> 04:44.170
Are you OK?

04:44.270 --> 04:46.812
Yeah. Yeah.

04:46.912 --> 04:49.894
You don't seem like you're OK.

04:49.994 --> 04:51.996
Yeah. It's probably
the hormones.

04:57.761 --> 04:59.762
Dad seems happy.

05:02.164 --> 05:04.166
I don't remember him
being this happy before.

05:06.608 --> 05:09.590
He was hiding stuff from me.

05:09.690 --> 05:12.012
He tried to look happy for me,
but I knew he wasn't.

05:14.895 --> 05:16.896
He's happy now.

06:06.016 --> 06:09.479
Hey! Did you reach someone?

06:09.579 --> 06:11.400
Gary!

06:11.500 --> 06:12.881
They're sending someone over.

06:12.981 --> 06:14.983
How long?

06:20.868 --> 06:23.690
I don't know.
Shouldn't be too long.

06:23.790 --> 06:26.733
We're 200km from Adelaide.

06:26.833 --> 06:28.094
They've gotta have drivers
closer than that.

06:28.194 --> 06:29.975
If they get here by 3,

06:30.075 --> 06:31.416
we can get home,
plenty of time to spare.

06:31.516 --> 06:33.518
4, even.
I've gotta get some shade.

06:37.401 --> 06:39.823
What time is it now?

06:39.923 --> 06:41.925
It's just before midday, baby.
It won't be long, I promise.

06:45.488 --> 06:46.488
Did you give them
our exact location?

06:46.568 --> 06:48.790
Yes. I already told you.

06:48.890 --> 06:49.851
- The operator said...
- Well, why aren't they here?

06:49.931 --> 06:51.633
I don't know! OK?

06:51.733 --> 06:53.314
I can go back to the top
of that hill...

06:53.414 --> 06:55.155
No, you can't! You can't
leave Emma here with me!

06:55.255 --> 06:57.257
Fuck!

06:58.938 --> 07:00.920
Fuck!
Why the fuck did we come here?

07:01.020 --> 07:03.402
You know why. We had a plan.

07:03.502 --> 07:05.284
We didn't realise that
this was gonna happen.

07:05.384 --> 07:07.285
- I have to go.
- Where?

07:07.385 --> 07:09.887
Away!
Away from you, away from her!

07:09.987 --> 07:13.250
I have to get as far as I
possibly can from both of you!

07:13.350 --> 07:14.991
How are you gonna...? What
are you even talking about?
How are you gonna do that?

07:15.071 --> 07:17.974
I just fucking
have to run somewhere!

07:18.074 --> 07:21.056
You're just gonna lock yourself
in the car and if I...

07:21.156 --> 07:23.018
..you make it out of here,
just come back and get me
in the morning.

07:23.118 --> 07:24.979
Fuck! I'm so sorry.

07:25.079 --> 07:26.741
You do not need to be sorry.

07:26.841 --> 07:28.382
Listen to me.

07:28.482 --> 07:30.264
It is not your fault.

07:30.364 --> 07:31.825
It is never your fault.

07:31.925 --> 07:33.927
I love you.

07:34.847 --> 07:36.849
I love you too.

07:41.292 --> 07:43.715
Where's Mary going?

07:43.815 --> 07:47.197
Wait in the car.

07:47.297 --> 07:49.299
Don't worry about it.
Just stay in the car.

09:21.974 --> 09:24.436
I need to go to the toilet.

09:24.536 --> 09:26.357
What do you mean?

09:26.457 --> 09:28.459
I mean
I need to go to the toilet.

09:29.780 --> 09:31.782
- Is it a one or a two?
- Dad.

09:33.023 --> 09:36.646
- Hold it in.
- No.

09:36.746 --> 09:38.727
Emma, I also
need to go to the toilet.

09:38.827 --> 09:40.409
Then why don't you go.

09:40.509 --> 09:42.870
I can't let you go outside.

09:44.832 --> 09:46.694
Dad, are you serious?

09:46.794 --> 09:49.136
How many times
do I have to tell you

09:49.236 --> 09:51.457
how important it is
that you stay in this car?

09:51.557 --> 09:53.739
You haven't told me why.

09:53.839 --> 09:56.662
It's dangerous. That's why.

09:56.762 --> 09:58.763
Then why did Mary
go running off like that?

10:05.128 --> 10:07.130
We slept out there last night.

10:13.615 --> 10:14.756
What are you doing? Stop.

10:14.856 --> 10:16.598
Stop it.

10:16.698 --> 10:18.799
Emma, stop!

10:18.899 --> 10:20.761
Emma...
Emma, seriously, stop that.

10:20.861 --> 10:22.242
Stop!

10:22.342 --> 10:23.403
OK! OK.

10:23.503 --> 10:26.385
OK. OK.

10:32.751 --> 10:37.214
The first time Mary and I
went on a date together,

10:37.314 --> 10:41.298
we went to an underground bar.

10:41.398 --> 10:43.740
So there were no windows
or anything like that,

10:43.840 --> 10:45.861
where you could see outside...

10:45.961 --> 10:47.963
..in the bar.

10:52.727 --> 10:55.789
We were meant to have lunch.

10:55.889 --> 10:59.032
But we drank a little,

10:59.132 --> 11:01.114
like adults do.

11:01.214 --> 11:02.915
And, um...

11:03.015 --> 11:05.597
..lost track of...

11:05.697 --> 11:07.699
..time.

11:08.339 --> 11:10.341
And...

11:13.103 --> 11:15.045
No.

11:15.145 --> 11:17.307
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

11:33.199 --> 11:35.201
Oh, God.

11:37.243 --> 11:39.244
Fuck!

11:47.931 --> 11:49.753
You right?

11:49.853 --> 11:53.155
- Get back in your car!
- What?

11:53.255 --> 11:55.257
It's not safe!
Get back in your car!

12:07.507 --> 12:09.208
- What you doing here?
- We, um...

12:09.308 --> 12:11.310
Our car broke down.

12:15.634 --> 12:17.655
Right.

12:17.755 --> 12:19.757
We can take a look
at that for you.

12:22.759 --> 12:24.761
- Can't we?
- Yeah, I think we can do that.

12:27.283 --> 12:30.826
I appreciate that, but, um...
we're good.

12:30.926 --> 12:33.468
I called the, uh, RAA

12:33.568 --> 12:36.390
and they should actually
be here at any minute.

12:36.490 --> 12:38.492
The RAA don't come out
this far, mate.

12:39.773 --> 12:41.775
Is it your battery?

12:43.656 --> 12:46.318
Go on, pop the hood for us.
Get out.

12:48.860 --> 12:50.862
No. No.

12:58.068 --> 13:00.069
Why not?

13:01.791 --> 13:05.814
We're being helpful.

13:05.914 --> 13:09.177
You have to listen to me.
It is not safe out here.

13:09.277 --> 13:10.658
You're right about that.

13:17.884 --> 13:19.385
Get out of the fucking car.

13:20.366 --> 13:23.428
Dad... Dad!

13:23.528 --> 13:26.070
I can't... I can't do that.

13:26.170 --> 13:28.833
I can't. I can't do that.

13:28.933 --> 13:30.474
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

13:30.574 --> 13:32.156
Just take this.

13:32.256 --> 13:32.616
Get back in your car,
and just get out of here.

13:33.696 --> 13:35.518
Get out.

13:36.499 --> 13:39.161
Dad!

13:39.261 --> 13:40.682
- Go on, out you get!
- Get out of this fucking car!

13:40.782 --> 13:43.965
Stop!
Out you get!

13:44.065 --> 13:46.207
- Get out of the fucking car.
- Out of the fucking car!

13:49.629 --> 13:52.372
- Get out.
- Get out!

13:52.472 --> 13:55.534
Trying to fucking help you, mate.

13:55.634 --> 13:57.055
Get out of the fucking car.

13:57.155 --> 13:58.617
Dad!

14:01.038 --> 14:04.061
Guys, just stop. Stop! Stop!

14:04.161 --> 14:06.383
- Out of the fucking car!

14:06.483 --> 14:08.585
- Agh!

14:13.288 --> 14:15.390
Dad, what's happening?

14:17.492 --> 14:19.473
Agh!

14:26.459 --> 14:28.461
Help!

14:33.144 --> 14:35.146
Dad!

14:36.427 --> 14:39.610
- Fucking help!

14:45.474 --> 14:47.576
Agh!

15:12.656 --> 15:14.658
Jayden.

15:15.298 --> 15:17.300
Jayden?

15:27.988 --> 15:30.050
- Oh!

15:37.236 --> 15:39.318
Help... me!

15:41.920 --> 15:43.901
Fuck!

16:45.771 --> 16:47.773
What is it?

16:49.494 --> 16:51.496
It's Mary.

16:58.221 --> 17:00.223
She turns into a wolf
sometimes.

17:47.461 --> 17:50.003
Em, Em, Em, Em!

17:50.103 --> 17:52.285
Em, look at me, baby.
You're OK. You're OK.

17:52.385 --> 17:53.966
We're gonna breathe.
We're gonna breathe.

17:54.066 --> 17:56.048
Follow my heart.
Follow my breath.

17:56.148 --> 17:58.690
Damn!

17:58.790 --> 18:00.852
Look. Look who I got.
Look who I got.

18:00.952 --> 18:03.494
Baby, I need you to breathe.

18:03.594 --> 18:05.595
I need you to breathe.
Come on.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.781
# There is
freedom within

18:12.881 --> 18:15.223
# There is freedom without

18:15.323 --> 18:18.866
# Try to catch the deluge
in a paper cup

18:18.966 --> 18:21.388
# There's a battle ahead

18:21.488 --> 18:23.870
# Many battles are lost

18:23.970 --> 18:26.072
# But you'll never see
the end of the road

18:26.172 --> 18:28.174
# While you're
travelling with me

18:29.935 --> 18:33.078
# Hey now, hey now

18:33.178 --> 18:36.440
- # Don't dream it's over... #

18:36.540 --> 18:39.363
# Hey now, hey now

18:39.463 --> 18:44.127
# When the world comes in

18:44.227 --> 18:46.228
# They come, they come

18:48.670 --> 18:51.112
# To build a wall between us

18:53.615 --> 18:55.616
# We know they won't win. #

19:12.169 --> 19:14.791
You're safe. You're safe.

21:35.885 --> 21:39.948
# Your heart is like a fortress

21:40.048 --> 21:42.470
# You keep your feelings
locked away

21:42.570 --> 21:46.233
# Is it easier?

21:46.333 --> 21:48.695
# Does it make you feel safe?

21:51.658 --> 21:55.761
# You wander
through the darkness

21:55.861 --> 21:58.643
# Of wilderness
behind your eyes

21:58.743 --> 22:01.526
# I know you're afraid

22:01.626 --> 22:04.668
# But you gotta move on

22:06.790 --> 22:10.533
# Every fortress falls

22:10.633 --> 22:14.696
# It is not the end

22:14.796 --> 22:18.499
# It ain't if you fall

22:18.599 --> 22:21.982
# But how you rise that says

22:22.082 --> 22:26.346
# Who you really are

22:26.446 --> 22:30.349
# So get up and come through

22:30.449 --> 22:32.711
# If ever your fortress caves

22:32.811 --> 22:35.313
# You're always safe

22:35.413 --> 22:39.356
# I believe I know you

22:39.456 --> 22:42.559
# Yet, I don't
truly know myself

22:42.659 --> 22:47.543
# I pray you won't feel
as alone as I have felt

22:51.025 --> 22:54.688
# I don't want to fail you so

22:54.788 --> 22:58.532
# I'll tell you the awful truth

22:58.632 --> 23:02.935
# Everyone faces darkness
on their own

23:03.035 --> 23:05.417
# As I have done, so will you

23:05.517 --> 23:09.701
# Every fortress falls

23:09.801 --> 23:13.464
# It is not the end

23:13.564 --> 23:17.507
# It ain't if you fall

23:17.607 --> 23:21.670
# But how you rise that says

23:21.770 --> 23:25.673
# Who you really are

23:25.773 --> 23:29.436
# So get up and go through

23:29.536 --> 23:32.039
# If ever your fortress caves

23:32.139 --> 23:35.421
# You're always safe in mine

23:42.147 --> 23:47.191
# The Earth spins round the sun

23:49.232 --> 23:51.234
# And behold

23:53.035 --> 23:57.819
# Everything happens

23:57.919 --> 24:05.165
# Every night falls prey
to sunrise

24:10.850 --> 24:14.793
# Every fortress falls

24:14.893 --> 24:18.476
# It is not the end

24:18.576 --> 24:22.559
# It ain't if you fall

24:22.659 --> 24:26.442
# But how you rise that says

24:26.542 --> 24:30.285
# Who you really are

24:30.385 --> 24:34.129
# So get up and go through

24:34.229 --> 24:36.891
# If ever your fortress caves

24:36.991 --> 24:42.135
# You're always safe in mine

24:42.235 --> 24:44.777
# If ever your fortress caves

24:44.877 --> 24:50.061
# You're always safe in mine

24:50.161 --> 24:52.623
# If ever your fortress caves

24:52.723 --> 24:55.846
# You're always safe in mine

24:57.808 --> 25:03.332
# Come on through

25:05.654 --> 25:11.819
# Come on through... #
