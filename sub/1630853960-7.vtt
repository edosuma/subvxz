WEBVTT

00:28.028 --> 00:29.487
Sameer takes the ball!

00:33.158 --> 00:34.367
Free kick!

00:35.035 --> 00:38.288
We're in a hurry,
and you're playing this rancid game?

00:38.371 --> 00:39.581
Your face is rancid.

00:39.664 --> 00:43.460
Hamoodi, listen to your sister,
don't waste time. Let them focus.

00:43.543 --> 00:45.795
Dad, did you fix my Walkman yet?

00:45.879 --> 00:47.422
Not yet. Go help your mom.

01:06.566 --> 01:07.650
Don't be scared.

01:22.040 --> 01:26.753
This is our nest egg.
If the Iraqis find it, they'll take it.

01:50.777 --> 01:52.237
Stop, stop, stop.

01:56.574 --> 02:00.620
Everyone off of the bus and take
your luggage with you. Immediately.

02:01.579 --> 02:04.374
Nadia, don't start crying.
You'll get us caught.

02:04.457 --> 02:08.753
Sameer, follow Nadia. I have a plan.

02:09.712 --> 02:10.880
Hamoodi.

02:10.964 --> 02:15.009
Hamoodi, look after Sameer. Okay?

02:15.093 --> 02:16.177
-Uh-huh.
-Okay? Go.

02:16.261 --> 02:19.013
Go, <i>habibi</i>. Good bye.

02:22.684 --> 02:25.478
I can't let them
search our bags with the money.

02:29.399 --> 02:32.443
Oh, God, make this task easy
and do not make it difficult.

02:32.527 --> 02:36.656
"And we have put a barrier before them
and after them, so they can't see."

02:36.739 --> 02:39.242
You have to pay taxes.
That's the law.

02:40.410 --> 02:44.414
If we find money before you come forward,
we will confiscate it all.

02:45.123 --> 02:45.957
On the bus.

02:46.708 --> 02:48.459
Come on. Quickly.

02:53.548 --> 02:57.260
Wait a minute.
I didn't see you get off the bus.

02:57.343 --> 03:00.388
You think I'm an idiot?
Do you hear me or not?

03:01.014 --> 03:04.350
If I may, please. We don't have any money.

03:05.018 --> 03:06.352
Okay, take them…

03:07.103 --> 03:08.730
take Michelangelo.

03:08.813 --> 03:12.233
Everyone know he's the best.
For the love of God.

03:12.317 --> 03:14.527
Hey, what are you doing?

03:14.611 --> 03:17.614
You think you're so important?
Making women and children cry?

03:17.697 --> 03:20.617
These have all been searched.
Look at the mess they made.

03:20.700 --> 03:23.912
Why are you still standing here?
Get off the bus at once.

03:27.040 --> 03:31.628
Don't be scared, <i>habibi</i>.
You like <i>Ninja Turtles</i>, right?

03:31.711 --> 03:35.006
Take it with you and enjoy it.
You're Palestinian, right?

03:35.506 --> 03:38.134
-Yes, Palestinian.
-You're among family here.

03:38.218 --> 03:39.677
May God bless you.

03:39.761 --> 03:41.596
God bless you. May you arrive in peace.

03:41.679 --> 03:44.724
-Thank you!
-God be with you. Drive.

03:46.142 --> 03:49.062
Hamoodi, where did you learn
to cry like that?

03:49.646 --> 03:51.773
How do you think
I got the Walkman?

03:53.650 --> 03:54.859
So clever.

04:45.243 --> 04:46.286
Take one.

04:49.330 --> 04:50.248
Take one.

04:50.832 --> 04:54.168
Hey. You're still blaming me. Take. Take.

05:13.896 --> 05:16.733
-How many more pounds of chicken are left?
-Eleven.

05:19.569 --> 05:23.114
Sorry I'm so late.
Good to see y'all. Come on in.

05:23.197 --> 05:25.658
Do you… You don't have an antacid, do you?

05:26.159 --> 05:28.494
No. I have some raw honey and tea.

05:28.578 --> 05:31.914
I have a crystal that might work too.
Just put it on your chest.

05:32.415 --> 05:36.419
-Where were you born, Mrs. Najjar?
-Uh, I was born in Palestine.

05:36.502 --> 05:40.965
And, and then, after the Zionists,
we moved to Kuwait, me and my husband.

05:41.049 --> 05:42.842
-From Kuwait to the US.
-You know what?

05:42.925 --> 05:46.179
You can't get this flustered on the stand.
They'll throw a lot at you.

05:46.262 --> 05:50.475
-Stay calm, cool and focused. Got it?
-I am not frustrated, dear Lizzie.

05:50.558 --> 05:55.229
I am just trying to remember
word by word the script you wrote.

05:55.730 --> 05:57.690
Mama, you remember
the note cards I made for you?

05:57.774 --> 06:00.109
No, Mo, enough, I can't take it anymore.

06:00.193 --> 06:03.321
This is reminding me of everything
painful we went through.

06:03.404 --> 06:06.699
The IDF forcing us
to move from Haifa to Burin,

06:06.783 --> 06:09.243
us leaving Kuwait after the Gulf War.

06:09.327 --> 06:13.289
The Iraqis breaking the front door.
The Kuwaitis breaking the side door,

06:13.373 --> 06:16.417
and eventually the Americans
breaking the back door.

06:16.501 --> 06:19.128
And on top of that,
I have to watch my husband

06:19.212 --> 06:23.841
get imprisoned for false accusations
and being tortured, physically, for it.

06:25.551 --> 06:27.053
Listen, Lizzie.

06:27.762 --> 06:28.721
I've seen a lot.

06:29.222 --> 06:33.851
But there's nothing worse than practicing
this stupid script of yours.

06:33.935 --> 06:35.228
It's okay.

06:35.645 --> 06:36.687
Ms. Najjar…

06:38.815 --> 06:39.732
Just like that.

06:41.734 --> 06:44.320
Minus the part about writing your script.

06:44.404 --> 06:45.321
Just like that.

06:48.991 --> 06:50.076
That's it?

06:50.159 --> 06:51.411
Anything else, Mama?

06:52.286 --> 06:53.621
-No, <i>habibi</i>.
-You sure?

06:54.539 --> 06:55.832
I've said everything.

06:56.666 --> 07:00.461
All right, y'all,
the paperwork is in a good place.

07:00.545 --> 07:02.755
You and Sameer have your testimonies down.

07:02.839 --> 07:05.299
This was our last order of business,
and we nailed it.

07:05.383 --> 07:08.928
God willing, in a couple of days,
you'll all be asylees.

07:09.011 --> 07:11.055
-Oh, God.<i> Inshallah.</i>
-Nice.

07:14.892 --> 07:17.687
Guy wants this in two hours,
is that okay? Cool.

07:33.953 --> 07:37.540
Ramon, if I see that ass crack again,
I'll pour car oil down it.

07:44.088 --> 07:46.507
Take care of this, I'll come back for it.

07:46.591 --> 07:48.384
-Come on, Mom. Let's go.
-Yeah.

07:49.844 --> 07:50.761
Thank you.

07:52.972 --> 07:53.806
We're good.

07:55.808 --> 07:59.061
Hi, I wanted to confirm
my clients' courtroom for today.

07:59.145 --> 08:03.900
-It's Najjars. N-A--
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down.

08:05.109 --> 08:05.943
N…

08:06.527 --> 08:07.778
-A…
-Hang on.

08:08.696 --> 08:10.448
Computer froze again.

08:10.531 --> 08:11.657
Oh. Okay.

08:12.450 --> 08:17.079
-I have Pepto Bismol. Let me get you some.
-I already took Pepto Bismol. Enough<i>.</i>

08:17.163 --> 08:20.291
-It's stress. Detachment anxiety.
-Why?

08:20.374 --> 08:23.377
The stuff he's going through
with that girl. Maria.

08:24.045 --> 08:25.254
She gave him diarrhea.

08:25.922 --> 08:29.717
If you listen to me,
and see it's a blessing,

08:29.800 --> 08:31.177
and it's a positive thing,

08:31.260 --> 08:33.387
I will hook you up with a nice girl, Mama.

08:33.471 --> 08:37.141
You don't get to ruin my relationship
and then play set up.

08:37.225 --> 08:38.518
I ruined it?

08:38.601 --> 08:42.855
How? How, son? By giving her
my bracelet and being kind and nice?

08:42.939 --> 08:45.983
Want the truth?
You didn't even give her a chance.

08:48.736 --> 08:49.570
Room 107.

08:49.654 --> 08:50.947
107. You sure?

08:51.572 --> 08:52.990
That's what I said.

08:53.074 --> 08:54.242
Okay. Thank you.

08:54.784 --> 08:56.285
All right, come on. This way.

08:58.746 --> 08:59.580
This way.

09:02.166 --> 09:03.000
…very cute.

09:03.084 --> 09:05.545
-They're a handful.
-I can see.

09:05.628 --> 09:07.588
Especially the little one.

09:08.881 --> 09:10.800
Is it hard
being away from Nigeria?

09:10.883 --> 09:13.678
I'm in Houston.
Where I live is Little Nigeria.

09:13.761 --> 09:16.931
Oh, yeah? How did you get here?

09:17.014 --> 09:18.057
On the Mayflower.

09:20.309 --> 09:23.062
-I came with Christopher Columbus.

09:23.145 --> 09:25.690
Looking for spices.
Got lost in the Bahamas.

09:29.110 --> 09:29.944
Oh…

09:33.864 --> 09:34.824
I'm so sorry.

09:41.497 --> 09:42.873
-Sameer, son.
-Yeah?

09:43.416 --> 09:46.252
Was I really terrible to Maria?

09:46.335 --> 09:47.169
No.

09:47.795 --> 09:49.547
You were just very, very rude.

09:50.798 --> 09:55.845
No, no. I only wanted Hamoodi
to marry the right girl. That's all.

09:57.388 --> 09:58.931
Oh, God!

10:01.976 --> 10:03.185
You okay in there?

10:05.313 --> 10:06.564
-Hey, Mama?
-Hm.

10:07.815 --> 10:10.192
How come you never ask me
about getting married?

10:10.693 --> 10:11.694
What do you mean?

10:11.777 --> 10:14.322
I'm your oldest son, and you never ask me.

10:17.742 --> 10:21.787
-Is it because something's wrong with me?
-No, no, no, no, no, no. No. No, no.

10:21.871 --> 10:23.497
Don't ever think like that.

10:23.581 --> 10:25.875
You're amazing.
There's nothing wrong with you.

10:25.958 --> 10:27.752
-Now, tell me.
-Huh.

10:27.835 --> 10:29.086
-Tell me.
-Huh.

10:29.170 --> 10:30.087
Yeah?

10:30.171 --> 10:33.549
-What?
-What do you look for in a future wife?

10:34.467 --> 10:36.093
I want a Yemeni girl.

10:36.177 --> 10:38.596
I wanna wear a khanjar on my wedding day.

10:39.096 --> 10:41.557
-Khanjar, khanjar like the dagger?
-Yeah, khanjar.

11:14.298 --> 11:15.299
Enjoy…

11:15.383 --> 11:16.550
Enjoy, my ass!

11:22.014 --> 11:24.141
-Hey, bro.
-I don't speak Spanish.

11:24.225 --> 11:27.269
No, I speak English.
You got any more of those in the back?

11:27.853 --> 11:28.729
Already.

11:29.563 --> 11:33.025
Already what? It already took my money,
that's what. I put a dollar and it's gone.

11:33.109 --> 11:34.193
It's out of order.

11:34.694 --> 11:37.405
If you knew it's out of order,
why would you let me try it?

11:37.488 --> 11:40.783
Well, the display's supposed to say
the machine isn't working,

11:40.866 --> 11:42.410
but the display's not working.

11:43.035 --> 11:43.994
What it do?

11:44.578 --> 11:48.666
What it do? What you should do
is make your own sign and put it up on it.

11:48.749 --> 11:49.834
That's what to do.

11:50.334 --> 11:52.002
Yes, sir.

11:52.586 --> 11:54.171
I'm in the fucking Matrix.

11:54.255 --> 11:56.257
-There you are. I've been looking for you.
-Yeah.

11:56.340 --> 11:57.633
Uh, you look like shit.

11:57.717 --> 12:00.428
-How do you really feel? Got water?
-Just got confiscated.

12:00.511 --> 12:01.887
Son of a bitch.

12:01.971 --> 12:04.140
You sick? I can't get sick,
I'm going to New Orleans--

12:04.223 --> 12:05.474
God, relax. I'm fine.

12:06.058 --> 12:08.352
-Is it nerves? What's--
-Yes, it's nerves. It's--

12:08.436 --> 12:10.563
All right. Okay, okay. It's gonna be fine.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.029
-Shit.
-What did she just say?

12:19.113 --> 12:21.574
They assigned a Mexican woman
a French translator.

12:21.657 --> 12:23.367
Her case is delayed by six months.

12:24.118 --> 12:24.952
Shit.

12:25.035 --> 12:27.371
-We should go.
-Let's get the fuck out of here.

12:31.751 --> 12:35.045
Nadia, give this
to your brother for his sweat.

12:37.339 --> 12:40.926
-What's going on with you and Mom?
-Maria and I broke up because of Mom.

12:41.010 --> 12:43.804
Really? Maria broke up with you
because of Mom?

12:44.388 --> 12:45.723
And other stuff.

12:45.806 --> 12:47.808
Look, it's complicated. Gimme a…

12:48.309 --> 12:51.395
-I don't need these questions now.
-You made it sound like it was her fault.

12:51.479 --> 12:53.439
I'm trying to figure out what happened.

13:10.539 --> 13:13.793
-So what's going on?
-Don't know. We should've been called.

13:13.876 --> 13:15.085
I don't know what's up.

13:15.669 --> 13:18.964
Samia, congratulations,
<i>habibti</i>. I'm so happy for you.

13:19.048 --> 13:19.882
Thank you.

13:19.965 --> 13:22.259
Oh, look, <i>habibti</i>,
look who it is.

13:22.343 --> 13:24.595
It's the Najjars. How funny.

13:24.678 --> 13:26.722
Mo, I miss you.

13:26.806 --> 13:27.807
I miss you.

13:30.726 --> 13:34.104
-And who might you be?
-Oh, Lizzie Horowitz. Their attorney.

13:34.188 --> 13:36.649
Horowitz? Seriously?

13:36.732 --> 13:38.984
You have a problem
with that? Uh?

13:39.068 --> 13:40.486
-Mm-hm?
-Uh?

13:40.569 --> 13:42.112
-Mm-hm?
-Uh?

13:42.196 --> 13:43.155
-Mm-hm?
-Uh?

13:43.239 --> 13:44.114
I see.

13:45.282 --> 13:47.993
-Rhonda Modad. Nice to meet you.
-Ms. Modad.

13:48.077 --> 13:52.373
We just got back from the other building
where Samia's asylum was granted.

13:52.873 --> 13:55.543
Yes.
Don't you want to congratulate Samia?

13:55.626 --> 13:58.087
Bullshit. I don't believe you
for a second.

13:58.170 --> 14:02.550
Yes, Mo, I did that for her.
Me, Rhonda Modad, attorney-at-law,

14:02.633 --> 14:04.134
proud Palestinian.

14:04.218 --> 14:07.263
I wish you all the luck
in the world, Lizzie Horowitz.

14:07.346 --> 14:11.058
-Thank you, Modad.
-Only, why are you all here?

14:11.141 --> 14:13.853
We're waiting for our hearing, okay?
Enough of this.

14:13.936 --> 14:17.273
Really? I just heard them
in the other building saying,

14:17.356 --> 14:19.275
"Najjars, Najjars, where are the Najjars?"

14:19.358 --> 14:20.943
Look, that's not funny, okay?

14:21.026 --> 14:22.111
I know I fired you,

14:22.194 --> 14:24.405
you kept the money,
it's no time to play games.

14:24.488 --> 14:26.866
-I heard it. They said Najjar.
-See?

14:27.700 --> 14:29.034
Lizzie, what the hell's going on?

14:29.118 --> 14:32.121
-She's saying that they were calling us.
-Not us. He told us 107.

14:32.204 --> 14:35.249
Are you sure you're not
in the other building? 107-B?

14:35.332 --> 14:37.001
I checked in first thing--

14:37.084 --> 14:39.962
You should've double and triple-checked.
Did you talk to Eddie?

14:40.045 --> 14:42.673
Because he's well known
for his clerical errors.

14:46.468 --> 14:49.722
You know what? Hopefully,
it's not too late. You better go.

14:49.805 --> 14:52.725
-Let's go. <i>Salaam,</i> Najjars.
-Good luck!

14:52.808 --> 14:55.644
-What's going on?
-He didn't say A or B, he said 107.

14:55.728 --> 14:58.772
-We should check. Put your shoes on!
-I am, Mo!

14:58.856 --> 15:01.567
-Why do you take them off?
-They're uncomfortable!

15:01.650 --> 15:03.652
-You're 6'2", wear flats!
-Calm down, <i>yalla.</i>

15:03.736 --> 15:06.530
-Excuse me.
-Why are you pulling away from the pack?

15:06.614 --> 15:09.408
-This isn't the Olympics.
-One of us has to check in.

15:09.491 --> 15:10.409
-Wait!
-Come on!

15:10.492 --> 15:13.704
When do you jog?
How did you get the numbers wrong?

15:13.787 --> 15:15.956
I didn't, he didn't tell me any letters!

15:16.040 --> 15:19.293
-I'm out of breath.
-You okay? Where's Sameer?

15:19.376 --> 15:21.378
-Where's Sameer?
-Go find him!

15:21.462 --> 15:23.964
-Go get Sameer. Please.
-Where is your brother?

15:25.299 --> 15:29.345
Hello. I'm Elizabeth Horowitz,
I represent the Najjar family.

15:29.428 --> 15:32.348
We've been calling you for ten minutes.
We've moved on already.

15:32.431 --> 15:34.391
What do you mean? You out of your mind?

15:34.475 --> 15:36.518
-You gotta get us in.
-Mo, it's okay.

15:36.602 --> 15:37.478
It's not okay.

15:37.561 --> 15:41.106
Mr. Clean here thinks he can wipe off
whoever he wants to off the list!

15:41.190 --> 15:43.984
-Better get us in. You don't scare me.
-Excuse me?

15:44.068 --> 15:47.029
Mo! You gotta get your shit together.
You'll fuck this all up.

15:47.112 --> 15:48.948
Please. Stop it. Enough.

15:50.908 --> 15:52.493
I'm sorry.

15:53.994 --> 15:56.205
There seems to be a misunderstanding.

15:56.288 --> 15:59.124
-Should've gone with Modad.
-No, I like this Polish lady.

15:59.625 --> 16:01.043
-Really?
-Why would I help?

16:01.126 --> 16:03.337
That guy just called me Mr. Clean!

16:03.837 --> 16:06.340
It doesn't matter
that they told me…

16:07.758 --> 16:08.717
You know, Mama,

16:09.760 --> 16:11.345
been thinking a lot about this.

16:12.429 --> 16:14.932
Maria, it's not all your fault. It's mine.

16:15.015 --> 16:16.016
No.

16:16.100 --> 16:17.810
I wasn't easy as well.

16:17.893 --> 16:21.355
It's an impossible situation.
Pick between my mom and my girlfriend?

16:22.398 --> 16:26.902
Listen, Mama, <i>Inshallah</i>, if it's gonna
work for you, it's gonna work for us.

16:27.903 --> 16:28.737
<i>Inshallah.</i>

16:28.821 --> 16:31.782
-Ma'am, I'm sorry, but you--
-Don't you "Ma'am" me!

16:32.366 --> 16:37.162
They have money to renew the courthouse,
and they can't get the room numbers right?

16:37.246 --> 16:40.833
You know how long they've been waiting?
What they've been through?

16:40.916 --> 16:44.920
-Stay here, Mom.
-No, son. Calm down.

16:45.004 --> 16:47.923
I know what you're feeling,
hearing about what happened to Dad

16:48.007 --> 16:51.010
-that way is not easy. I know.
-Mama, I know Dad was tortured.

16:52.386 --> 16:53.846
Found it in the case file.

16:54.430 --> 16:57.182
I wish he was alive so I could show
how much I appreciate him.

16:57.266 --> 16:58.267
For real, son.

16:58.350 --> 17:01.603
If your dad was alive,
he would've been really proud of you.

17:01.687 --> 17:03.147
Really, Mama.

17:05.232 --> 17:06.150
<i>Inshallah</i>.

17:06.650 --> 17:09.403
-There they are. Where have you been?
I saw a bird.

17:09.486 --> 17:10.696
-You saw a bird.
-Yeah.

17:10.779 --> 17:13.157
-A birdie? Oh!
-A purple finch.

17:13.240 --> 17:15.117
-Yeah.
-You know what's happening today?

17:15.200 --> 17:17.244
-It's very rare.
-It's a rare case.

17:17.327 --> 17:19.747
…right now or the ACLU

17:19.830 --> 17:22.833
and I will file
a chapter three malpractice suit,

17:22.916 --> 17:25.461
and I'll name you
personally as a defendant.

17:27.171 --> 17:28.714
So what's it gonna be?

17:35.804 --> 17:37.139
-Okay.
-Oh, thank you!

17:37.222 --> 17:38.432
Okay. Go, go, go, go.

17:46.398 --> 17:48.108
Chapter three malpractice suit?

17:48.609 --> 17:50.527
-I made it up.

17:50.611 --> 17:53.280
It's all good.
I'm going to Dreams tonight.

17:54.615 --> 17:56.450
The case is set for hearing on the issue

17:56.533 --> 17:59.119
of relief from removal,
specifically asylum.

17:59.203 --> 18:01.914
We'll now invite Ms. Najjar
to the stand, please.

18:02.539 --> 18:03.457
You got this.

18:06.210 --> 18:07.920
Raise your right hand.

18:08.003 --> 18:11.882
You swear the testimony you'll give
today is true and correct so help you God?

18:11.965 --> 18:13.175
Yes, of course.

18:13.759 --> 18:14.593
Please.

18:15.469 --> 18:18.806
-Ms. Horowitz, whenever you're ready.
-Thank you, Your Honor.

18:20.265 --> 18:24.019
-Would you state your name for the record?
-Yusra Najjar.

18:25.896 --> 18:27.856
When were you born, Ms. Najjar?

18:27.940 --> 18:31.360
March 5th, 1958.

18:31.443 --> 18:32.903
And where were you born?

18:33.487 --> 18:35.072
Burin, Palestine.

18:35.155 --> 18:38.408
Objection. Palestine is not a state
recognized by the court.

18:40.244 --> 18:41.286
Overruled.

18:42.037 --> 18:43.122
Counsel, continue.

18:43.622 --> 18:47.751
Ms. Najjar, when you immigrated
to the United States, was it from Kuwait?

18:47.835 --> 18:50.462
Excuse me. Just, uh… Excuse me.

18:50.546 --> 18:51.964
I'm sorry to interrupt Ms. Najjar.

18:53.048 --> 18:58.345
It says here that you are married
to Mustafa Najjar. Is that correct?

18:58.428 --> 18:59.263
Yes.

19:00.806 --> 19:03.142
Could you tell me
about your husband, please?

19:04.059 --> 19:05.394
Yes, um…

19:05.936 --> 19:08.605
He's from the same village like me.

19:09.273 --> 19:14.278
He used to work as a telecommunication
engineer back home,

19:14.361 --> 19:19.491
and, um, when we came here to America,
he went and bought a store--

19:19.575 --> 19:21.660
A 99 Cent Plus store.

19:22.494 --> 19:23.328
Yes.

19:23.412 --> 19:27.457
Ms. Najjar, could I ask you
to please step down and rejoin counsel?

19:28.375 --> 19:29.209
Yes.

19:30.210 --> 19:32.045
Ms. Najjar, I knew your husband

19:32.129 --> 19:35.090
when I used to sit
on the other side of this bench.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.675
Is, is he not here today?

19:37.384 --> 19:38.760
No, um…

19:39.761 --> 19:42.097
He passed away over 20 years ago.

19:45.559 --> 19:47.603
I was afraid that was the case.

19:51.773 --> 19:53.233
Mustafa was my client.

19:54.109 --> 19:56.904
We, we worked together for nearly a year
before he…

19:57.404 --> 19:59.072
he disappeared. I mean--

19:59.156 --> 20:02.409
Your Honor, his death was very sudden.

20:04.077 --> 20:05.370
I am so very sorry.

20:06.788 --> 20:07.623
Thank you.

20:07.706 --> 20:09.416
I remember hearing his story.

20:10.667 --> 20:13.670
I imagined myself being in his shoes,

20:14.338 --> 20:19.509
wondering how he could retain
such hope after enduring so much.

20:20.719 --> 20:23.722
And I'd be so honored
to help his family today.

20:23.805 --> 20:26.600
<i>-Alhamdulillah! </i>
Yes!<i> Alhamdulillah!</i>

20:27.684 --> 20:29.478
-But unfortunately…
What?

20:30.395 --> 20:32.522
I cannot continue these proceedings.

20:33.607 --> 20:34.566
Huh?

20:35.067 --> 20:37.194
Of course, you can. Why not?

20:37.945 --> 20:39.071
Because I knew him.

20:39.154 --> 20:41.448
Exactly. We're good people.

20:41.531 --> 20:42.991
So sign the paper.

20:43.075 --> 20:46.912
-We'll go to Cracker Barrel, get a steak--
-I'm sure you're good people.

20:46.995 --> 20:47.829
I'm sorry. I--

20:47.913 --> 20:50.832
Judge, Your Honor,
please just sign the paper.

20:50.916 --> 20:53.126
-It's a conflict of interest.
-I understand--

20:53.210 --> 20:57.422
I have no choice
but to recuse myself.

20:57.506 --> 21:01.510
I give you my word,
I'll try to get you through this system.

21:01.593 --> 21:03.845
-But you're gonna have to reschedule.
-When?

21:03.929 --> 21:06.848
When? You know how hard it is
just to get in? Till when?

21:07.808 --> 21:09.101
That I cannot answer.

21:10.352 --> 21:11.520
Court is adjourned.
