00:38.120 --> 00:39.951
Is that him?

00:40.600 --> 00:42.192
Yes.

00:43.080 --> 00:44.798
Oliver!

00:45.000 --> 00:47.275
[ECHOES]

01:33.680 --> 01:35.875
God be with you, Oliver.
And you too, John.

01:36.080 --> 01:37.638
This is Henry Ireton,
a good friend.

01:37.840 --> 01:39.910
Good day to you, sir.
Mr. lreton.

01:40.600 --> 01:43.034
l've just been taking
a last look at my land.

01:43.240 --> 01:46.755
We had heard you were
leaving, Mr. Cromwell.
We came from London directly.

01:46.960 --> 01:49.474
You could have saved
yourself the effort, Mr. lreton.

01:49.680 --> 01:50.999
If we could discuss it,
Oliver, I'm sure--

01:51.200 --> 01:53.589
There is nothing
to discuss, John.

01:53.800 --> 01:57.395
Well, come back to my house.
You've got a long journey back.

03:31.280 --> 03:33.840
You must forgive
the manner
of our table, Mr. Pym.

03:34.040 --> 03:36.713
Our best crockery
is packed for the voyage.

03:36.920 --> 03:39.115
Bridget, fetch the bread.
Yes, Mother.

03:39.320 --> 03:41.151
We had hoped to
persuade your husband

03:41.361 --> 03:43.591
to change his mind
about going
to America, ma'am.

03:43.800 --> 03:47.156
l should have thought
you would know Oliver
better than that, Mr. Pym.

03:47.360 --> 03:49.078
lt was not
an easy decision, John.

03:49.280 --> 03:52.397
This is my country,
my land. God has
been good to me here.

03:52.720 --> 03:57.111
Then, sir, why are you leaving?
l have a family, Mr. lreton.

03:57.521 --> 03:59.955
l owe it to my sons
to make a better life
for them.

04:00.160 --> 04:02.549
England is no longer
a country for a young man.

04:02.760 --> 04:05.558
l recall you often
spoke out strongly in
Parliament for the rights

04:05.760 --> 04:06.749
and privileges
of the common people.

04:07.001 --> 04:08.878
Ah.

04:09.080 --> 04:11.958
That was a long
time ago, Mr. lreton.

04:12.160 --> 04:13.752
I had a vision then.

04:13.960 --> 04:15.393
A great nation.

04:15.600 --> 04:20.469
Prosperous, God-fearing,
good laws, strong,

04:20.680 --> 04:22.796
respected throughout the world.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.514
That was the England
I dreamed of.

04:25.760 --> 04:29.719
Well, sir, you are a squire now,
a man of property.

04:29.920 --> 04:32.912
Perhaps you no longer care
for the common people.

04:33.280 --> 04:35.316
Perhaps I've been
misinformed, sir.

04:35.521 --> 04:39.036
l thought, as a Puritan,
you would see it
as your God-given duty

04:39.240 --> 04:42.630
to do the Lord's work
in this land, regardless
of sacrifice.

04:42.840 --> 04:47.118
Mr. lreton, l was
fighting for the liberty
of the common people

04:47.320 --> 04:49.151
when you were
in knee breeches.

04:49.840 --> 04:52.229
Then why
are you leaving?

04:54.880 --> 04:59.112
l am leaving because
this country crawls
with greed and corruption.

04:59.320 --> 05:01.038
It is governed by adventurers
and profiteers

05:01.240 --> 05:04.152
who think more
of their pockets
than their principles.

05:04.320 --> 05:08.279
l am leaving, sir, because
we have a king who taxes
the rich beyond its means

05:08.480 --> 05:10.835
and steals land from
the poor to maintain

05:11.000 --> 05:13.673
his lavish court
and his Catholic wife.

05:13.960 --> 05:16.918
Now, when Parliament
objected against
these injustices

05:17.080 --> 05:18.957
he closed
his Parliament down.

05:19.120 --> 05:22.430
And our man
dare not speak his mind
for fear of imprisonment.

05:22.640 --> 05:24.039
Oh, yes.

05:24.240 --> 05:28.028
All my life l believed
it was God's work to fight
against such tyranny.

05:28.240 --> 05:34.509
But God has turned
his back upon this nation,
and we are leaving it.

05:35.800 --> 05:38.837
And what if Parliament
should be recalled,
Mr. Cromwell?

05:39.040 --> 05:42.157
And why should a king do that?
He needs money, Oliver.

05:43.440 --> 05:47.353
What? To build another palace?
No.

05:47.560 --> 05:49.869
To fight a war.

05:52.760 --> 05:55.513
A war, John?

05:56.280 --> 05:58.396
A war against whom?

05:58.600 --> 06:00.909
The Scots have assembled
and army on our border.

06:01.081 --> 06:02.958
They may invade us
at any moment.

06:03.160 --> 06:05.151
The king needs money
to raise an army.

06:05.400 --> 06:06.719
Ah.

06:07.360 --> 06:10.909
By the king's own decree,
Parliament has not sat
these past 1 2 years.

06:11.120 --> 06:15.033
And now the king needs money.
Once Parliament has assembled,

06:15.240 --> 06:18.391
it will lie within
our power to change

06:18.600 --> 06:21.956
the whole structure
of government
in this country.

06:22.160 --> 06:24.355
John, how many times
did we sit in Parliament
in the old days

06:24.560 --> 06:26.278
and how many
resolutions
did we pass?

06:26.440 --> 06:28.908
And how many times
did this king overrule us?

06:29.121 --> 06:31.157
Oh, the king can have
his war with Scotland.

06:31.320 --> 06:33.914
We will be in America.
There will be a war, Mr. Cromwell,

06:34.080 --> 06:37.311
but it will not be with Scotland.
Henry.

06:37.760 --> 06:38.875
With whom, Mr. Ireton?

06:39.040 --> 06:41.031
Henry, we have argued
this matter many times.

06:41.240 --> 06:42.195
I'm convinced of it.

06:42.400 --> 06:47.997
A war against whom, Mr. lreton?
Against the king, sir.

06:49.640 --> 06:51.392
The king?

06:51.760 --> 06:56.550
You mean a civil war?
In England?

06:57.280 --> 06:58.395
[CHUCKLES]

06:58.680 --> 07:02.719
You know not the ways
of this nation, Mr. lreton.
Such things do not happen here.

07:02.960 --> 07:05.520
And in my opinion,
it is long overdue.

07:05.721 --> 07:07.757
l will not have
such talk in my house.

07:07.920 --> 07:10.275
It is common enough talk
these days, I fear.

07:10.480 --> 07:14.792
Then it is treasonable talk!
And I will not have it
in my house!

07:15.000 --> 07:18.072
l mark the time when you
were much against the king
and never feared to say so.

07:18.280 --> 07:20.475
In truth, there is much
in this king that
does offend me.

07:20.640 --> 07:24.519
Yet, with all, I would not take up
arms against him, and I would
oppose any move to do so.

07:24.721 --> 07:26.712
ln such a cause,
our swords will be
in God's hands.

07:26.880 --> 07:30.759
It's an odd thing, Mr. Ireton.
Every man who wages war
believes God is on his side.

07:30.960 --> 07:35.670
l warrant God should
often wonder who is
on his. Good evening, sir.

07:36.840 --> 07:38.876
Well, if I did give you offence,
sir, I beg your pardon.

07:39.080 --> 07:43.039
You're a young man, Mr. lreton.
lt's fitting a young man
should want to change the world.

07:43.200 --> 07:46.431
Not the world, sir.
Only England.

07:48.760 --> 07:51.399
With a civil war.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.915
Good evening, Mrs. Cromwell.
Good evening, Mr. lreton.

07:56.081 --> 07:58.276
I'll get your cloak,
Mr. Ireton.

07:58.840 --> 08:00.831
I hope you'll forgive him.

08:01.040 --> 08:03.076
Goodbye, John.

08:04.760 --> 08:07.115
God be with you, Oliver.

This is the common land.

08:29.160 --> 08:31.196
[GRUNTING]

08:32.720 --> 08:36.269
Any man who raises a hand
against the king's men
will be arrested.

08:36.481 --> 08:39.041
You have no right to do this.
This land is ours.

08:39.280 --> 08:41.032
Well, now it belongs
to the Earl of Manchester.

08:41.320 --> 08:42.355
By whose authority?

08:42.600 --> 08:45.990
By the authority of the king.
Then l say the king is a thief!

08:47.240 --> 08:48.958
You're under arrest.
Take him away!

08:49.200 --> 08:51.270
Bastards!
Look at him, now. What's he done?

08:51.480 --> 08:53.550
He's done nothing.
Release that man!

08:53.760 --> 08:55.716
Who the devil are you?
This man works for me.

08:55.920 --> 08:57.672
Whatever he has done,
l will take full responsibility.

08:57.840 --> 09:01.799
He has spoken treason
against the king. Will you
take responsibility for that?

09:03.800 --> 09:05.950
The rights to pasture belong
to the common people.

09:06.160 --> 09:08.435
By what authority,
Lord Manchester,
do you take that away?

09:08.760 --> 09:11.274
By the authority
of His Majesty's
commissioners,

09:11.440 --> 09:15.115
granting me and my friends
full rights to this land for
the purpose of improvement.

09:15.360 --> 09:19.319
Such a contract cannot
be legal. lt is in violation
of the law of this land.

09:19.560 --> 09:23.235
As a magistrate, you should know
the king is the law of this land.

09:23.480 --> 09:27.473
On the contrary, my Lord
Manchester. lt is the king's
duty to maintain the law.

09:27.640 --> 09:29.835
This is common land.
lt belongs to the people.

09:30.201 --> 09:32.431
This is my land,
and you are trespassing.

09:32.640 --> 09:35.871
It's only out of respect for your
rank I don't have you arrested
for obstructing the law.

09:36.080 --> 09:37.718
Captain Lundsford!
My lord?

09:37.920 --> 09:40.912
See that no unauthorized
person enters this area.

09:41.160 --> 09:44.436
Yes, my lord.
Remove these people.

Squire, have you news
of my husband?

It's in God's hands,

Amen.

10:34.640 --> 10:37.029
Who has done this?

10:37.600 --> 10:42.958
Answer me. Who has done this?
An edict, squire,

10:43.160 --> 10:46.755
from the archbishop himself
and by order of the king.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.719
By order of the king.

10:50.120 --> 10:53.271
Is the Church of England
not a Protestant church?

10:53.480 --> 10:58.395
Would the king
turn the house of God
into a Roman temple?

10:58.640 --> 11:01.950
Mr. Cromwell, l beseech you.
Does the king think that God

11:02.120 --> 11:06.398
can be bought with gold,
trinkets and gilded rubbish?

11:06.600 --> 11:08.955

that l have

14:08.960 --> 14:13.033
that His Highness,
Prince Charles, was absent
from prayers this morning.

14:13.200 --> 14:14.474
He was with me, my lord.

14:14.720 --> 14:17.280
He did pray with you?
In your chapel?

14:17.480 --> 14:20.950
Yes, my lord.
l am most displeased.

14:21.160 --> 14:23.196
lt is not fitting that
a future king of England

14:23.360 --> 14:25.874
should make his devotions
in a Catholic chapel.

14:26.040 --> 14:30.079
Your private beliefs are respected.
But this is a Protestant country

14:30.280 --> 14:35.308
and as head of both church
and state, it is my God-given duty
to see that it so remains.

14:35.520 --> 14:39.832
His Highness found the whole
business so boring, my lord,
that he fell asleep.

14:40.040 --> 14:42.190
Didn't you, Charles?
Yes, madam.

14:42.800 --> 14:46.952

your church as solid
as ever, my lord.

Nevertheless, you will kindly see
that it does not happen again.

We would not have
summoned you, Lord Strafford,
had the situation here

15:27.280 --> 15:28.918
not been of
a greatest urgency.

15:29.160 --> 15:32.470
You've doubtless heard
that the Scottish rebels
are marching on Newcastle?

15:32.680 --> 15:33.635
Aye, my lord.

15:33.840 --> 15:37.116

But what of lreland, my lord?
We'll deal with lreland in good time.

15:41.960 --> 15:47.637
You'll march an army on Scotland.
Army. What army?

15:47.840 --> 15:52.152
Most of your army lies rotting
beneath the bogs of Ireland.

15:52.360 --> 15:56.035
What's left of it
is hard-pressed
to keep law and order.

15:57.440 --> 15:59.510
Then we will raise
a second army.

that easier said than done.

What? l guarantee l could
raise 3000 men under arms
inside a month!

But could you guarantee
their loyalty, my lord?

16:10.040 --> 16:12.634
Is there an Englishman living
who wouldn't draw a sword

16:12.800 --> 16:13.835
against his king's enemies?

16:14.040 --> 16:16.190
There would be many
Englishmen, my Lord Strafford,

16:16.400 --> 16:18.675
who would more readily
draw swords against the king.

16:18.921 --> 16:24.473
My God, who is this jackanapes
that mouths such treason
in your presence, my lord?

16:24.680 --> 16:26.875
You've been away
a long time, Strafford.

16:27.040 --> 16:29.634
Much here has changed.

16:29.841 --> 16:31.718
Aye, I can see it has.

16:31.920 --> 16:34.878
l fear Sir Edward
but speaks the truth.

16:35.440 --> 16:39.353
To put an effective army
in the field against the Scots
will cost almost a million pounds.

16:39.560 --> 16:42.950
The Crown does not
have a million pounds.

16:43.760 --> 16:47.469
Are we just going to sit here
then and do nothing?

16:48.680 --> 16:54.277
Then l will summon
Parliament and instruct
them to provide money.

16:54.600 --> 16:56.795
Parliament?!

16:57.640 --> 17:02.668
The king of England
go cap in hand to
the common people, like a--?

17:02.960 --> 17:05.633
A beggar.
Aye! A beggar?

17:10.160 --> 17:13.675
l have no choice.
l say take the money.

17:13.880 --> 17:18.271
You, my lord, are absolved
before God and before man
from any such action.

17:19.000 --> 17:24.279
For in extreme necessity,
the king is acquitted from
all rule of government

17:24.480 --> 17:26.914
and can do all
that his power permits.

17:27.119 --> 17:31.193
Power? Where is the power
of a king without an army?

17:31.641 --> 17:33.632
l'll warrant you,
l'll raise an army.

17:33.840 --> 17:37.799
We'll reduce this kingdom
to submission in one summer!

17:38.000 --> 17:44.269
Do you mean, sir,
that l should declare war
on my own people?

17:44.480 --> 17:46.471
Aye!

17:46.680 --> 17:50.195
Before they declare
war on you.

18:20.440 --> 18:24.513
Well, sons, there it is.

18:24.720 --> 18:26.711
Parliament House.

18:26.920 --> 18:30.230
Upon that place
rests all the hopes
of this nation

18:30.400 --> 18:32.550
for a settlement
of its ills in peace.

18:32.760 --> 18:35.399
Do you think it could
come to war, Father?

18:35.600 --> 18:38.273
Well, Oliver,
when men run out
of words,

18:38.440 --> 18:40.351
they reach
for their swords.

18:40.560 --> 18:43.677
Let's hope we can
keep them talking.

18:44.360 --> 18:48.399
MAN: The king demands
money to raise an army.

18:48.600 --> 18:50.989
[YELLING]

18:51.320 --> 18:55.598
MAN: This House demands
redress for grievances.

18:57.720 --> 19:04.068
Grievances which the past
12 years have laid heavy
upon the nation. l say that--

19:04.960 --> 19:09.954
Might l be heard? l say, therefore,
this House is resolved that we'll vote...

19:10.160 --> 19:11.832
Welcome back
to Parliament.

19:12.040 --> 19:14.838
...no money for the king!

19:17.000 --> 19:19.070
Order! Order!

19:20.440 --> 19:25.070
Neither will we take up
arms against our Scottish
brethren, unless...

19:25.280 --> 19:30.195
Unless this Parliament
is allowed to function

19:30.400 --> 19:35.110
as the true voice
of the people of England.

19:35.320 --> 19:39.393
And not as a gathering
of lackeys to the king.

19:39.600 --> 19:42.239
[CHEERING]

20:00.840 --> 20:03.832
Sir Edward Hyde,
Your Majesty.

20:04.840 --> 20:06.478
Well, Sir Edward?
Your Majesty.

20:06.760 --> 20:10.036
l believe the House
will grant a loan to the Crown.

20:10.200 --> 20:12.953
But only on
certain conditions.

20:13.160 --> 20:17.073
Conditions?
What do you mean,
conditions?

20:17.280 --> 20:19.953
What are these conditions,
Sir Edward?

20:20.160 --> 20:21.752
In essence, sire,

20:21.960 --> 20:25.635
that the Crown relinquishes
all authority over Parliament.

20:26.320 --> 20:30.996
And who put forward
this proposal?

20:31.560 --> 20:35.473
John Pym, Henry Ireton,
John Hampden.

20:35.680 --> 20:37.113
The Puritans.

20:37.680 --> 20:39.272
They were well
supported, my lord.

20:39.520 --> 20:43.069
And they call
themselves Englishmen?

20:43.280 --> 20:46.272
My God, it's enough to make
a man deny his birthright.

20:46.481 --> 20:49.712
Yet, withal, they still
be Englishmen.

20:49.920 --> 20:52.309
They make a mockery
of the Crown!

20:52.520 --> 20:57.514
They abuse the privilege
of free speech with sedition
and treason.

20:57.720 --> 21:02.510
You're too loud,
Lord Strafford. lt is most
unpleasant to the ear.

21:05.160 --> 21:07.196
So it has come to this, my lord.

21:07.401 --> 21:12.873
That you now bargain for your Crown.
What would you have me do?

21:13.080 --> 21:16.390
Arrest every man
who opposes me?
Hang them?

21:16.920 --> 21:19.753
Would you rather make
a gift of the Crown of England

21:19.920 --> 21:22.070
to the rabble in the street?

21:22.240 --> 21:27.314
lt lies beyond my power
to arrest a citizen without
proper charges.

21:27.520 --> 21:30.239
Charges are immaterial.

21:30.600 --> 21:34.229
Such an act would subvert
the fundamental laws
of this land, madam.

21:34.600 --> 21:38.878
Such an act might
save the Crown
of England, my lord.

21:39.800 --> 21:43.076
l've governed this
country justly and
fairly these 12 years

21:43.240 --> 21:46.357
without reference
to any Parliament.

21:47.240 --> 21:51.597
You may be assured,
l do not intend now to be
schooled in my high office

21:51.800 --> 21:55.759
by illiterate farm
hands, cobblers

21:56.920 --> 21:59.275
and basket weavers.

21:59.640 --> 22:03.713
My Lord Strafford,
you will rid us of
these troublemakers:

22:03.961 --> 22:06.316
Pym, Ireton,
all of them.

22:06.801 --> 22:09.873
l'll arrest every one of them, my lord.
As you will.

22:10.080 --> 22:13.436
l shall need a warrant.
That is imperative.

22:13.640 --> 22:16.837
And what will the
charges be, my lord?

22:17.040 --> 22:20.430
You're an experienced officer
of the Crown, Strafford.

22:20.640 --> 22:24.110
You do not need
to be instructed
by me.

22:26.440 --> 22:28.749
Mr. Speaker.

22:29.880 --> 22:32.030
May l have permission
to address the House?

22:32.200 --> 22:34.191
SPEAKER: By all means, sir.
Gentlemen.

22:34.400 --> 22:38.552
A matter has come
to my notice, which is
of deep concern to me

22:38.760 --> 22:43.709
and will, l am sure,
be to every single
member of this House.

22:45.120 --> 22:48.829
The Earl of Strafford has,
this day, put his hand
to a warrant

22:49.040 --> 22:51.759
for the arrest
and impeachment
of myself

22:51.920 --> 22:54.992
and four other honourable
members of this House

22:55.160 --> 22:58.391
upon a charge
of high treason.

22:58.640 --> 23:00.551
[YELLING]

23:00.760 --> 23:03.911
Though Strafford's hand
be upon this warrant,

23:04.120 --> 23:09.513
l see in this business,
not the hand of Strafford,
but that of the king.

23:11.040 --> 23:12.951
My lords!

23:13.520 --> 23:18.196
l beseech you,
do not condemn
this king too hastily.

23:18.400 --> 23:22.029
For l am persuaded
he has been ill-advised
upon this course.

23:22.280 --> 23:25.556
Is not a king to be judged
by those from whom
he seeks counsel?

23:25.720 --> 23:26.914
He is not!

23:27.920 --> 23:32.869
lt is not the function
of this House to sit
in judgement upon this king.

23:33.080 --> 23:37.676
The fault lies with those
very people from whom
the king has sought counsel.

23:37.880 --> 23:42.954
l therefore move
that this House demands

23:43.720 --> 23:46.473
the arrest and impeachment
of the Earl of Strafford

23:46.680 --> 23:51.390
upon a charge of high treason
against the people of this nation.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.798
Silence! Order!

23:57.000 --> 24:01.949
The motion has been proposed.
Let it be put now to the question.

24:02.160 --> 24:05.630
Is the motion agreed?
MEN: No!

24:05.880 --> 24:07.029
In favour of the motion?

24:07.521 --> 24:10.354
MEN:
Aye! Aye! Aye!

24:10.841 --> 24:12.638
The ayes have it.

24:47.080 --> 24:50.390
l think my Lord
Strafford's condition

24:50.600 --> 24:55.196
will soon be far
happier than mine.

25:07.760 --> 25:11.435
[PRAYING IN FRENCH]

25:19.040 --> 25:21.110
Do you see, madam?

25:21.320 --> 25:24.392
Do you see now what
you've made me do?

25:28.400 --> 25:31.710
[CONTINUES PRAYING]

25:52.400 --> 25:55.312
Gentlemen, His Majesty.

25:59.440 --> 26:01.396
Pray be seated.

26:06.120 --> 26:09.829
Your coming is
nothing if not timely.

26:10.520 --> 26:15.150
My Lord Strafford's head
has but barely fallen.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.833
Now, gentlemen,
it is for you to speak.

26:22.760 --> 26:26.548
Your Majesty, you see here
the leaders of all parties
of the House.

26:26.761 --> 26:30.436
And though we be divided
on many issues, we are
of one accord.

26:30.920 --> 26:34.879
ln that we place above
all else, our allegiance
and loyalty

26:35.080 --> 26:37.389
to our most
gracious sovereign.

26:37.800 --> 26:39.836
For which reason
we are deeply anxious

26:40.000 --> 26:42.195
for a settlement
of the differences
between us.

26:42.441 --> 26:45.797
I share your sentiment,
Sir Edward.

26:48.240 --> 26:50.879
The issue be this,
my lord.

26:51.640 --> 26:54.791
Parliament is persuaded
that without the right
to govern this nation

26:55.000 --> 26:59.357
by the will of the people
and with God's guidance,

26:59.520 --> 27:02.318
we be not a Parliament at all.

27:02.480 --> 27:06.837
And that unless some
constitutional reformation
be brought about,

27:07.040 --> 27:12.239
we would as well
go back to our homes and
our farms as pursue this

27:12.440 --> 27:15.000
mockery of a government
one more day.

27:15.280 --> 27:17.271
In short, Mr. Pym,
you're asking me

27:17.480 --> 27:20.916
to relinquish my sovereign
power over Parliament.

27:21.120 --> 27:23.429
It does amount to that,
Your Majesty.

27:23.640 --> 27:26.393
l do swear that l hold
this England and its laws

27:26.560 --> 27:29.028
dearer to my heart
than any here.

27:29.240 --> 27:33.438
But gentlemen, if you were
to reduce me to a
figurehead, a puppet king

27:33.600 --> 27:36.910
manipulated by Parliament,
how then would I serve
my country?

27:37.121 --> 27:40.238
What manner
of king would l be?

27:41.680 --> 27:43.318
I am persuaded,
Your Majesty,

27:43.520 --> 27:47.638
that England must move forward
to a more enlightened
form of government

27:47.800 --> 27:51.509
based upon
a true representation
of a free people.

27:51.720 --> 27:55.554
Such an institution
is known as democracy, sir.

27:56.520 --> 28:00.479
A democracy, Mr...?
Cromwell, sir.

28:01.240 --> 28:05.074
Democracy, Mr. Cromwell,
was a Greek drollery

28:05.280 --> 28:09.398
based on the foolish
notion that there are
extraordinary possibilities

28:09.600 --> 28:11.431
in very ordinary people.

28:12.120 --> 28:16.079
lt is the ordinary people,
my lord, who would most
readily lay down their lives

28:16.240 --> 28:18.037
in defence of your realm.

28:18.600 --> 28:22.070
lt is simply
that being ordinary,

28:22.280 --> 28:25.511
they would prefer
to be asked and not told.

28:27.200 --> 28:31.352
You know, as l do, that even
as we sit here, the Scots rebels
are invading this land

28:31.560 --> 28:37.874
and not an English sword
is raised against them. l beg you,
therefore, let us bury our differences

28:38.080 --> 28:40.719
in defence of both
our church and kingdom.

28:40.920 --> 28:47.268
The Scots invade our land
and all is urgency and alarm.

28:47.560 --> 28:50.870
ln the past 12 months
our lrish colonists
have been slaughtered,

28:51.160 --> 28:55.392
our churches desecrated,
our clergy persecuted.

28:55.600 --> 28:57.431
The Crown has been
oddly reluctant

28:57.600 --> 29:00.751
to defend our church
and kingdom over there, sir.

29:00.920 --> 29:03.992
By my guard, l would
as soon take up arms
against Rome

29:04.200 --> 29:06.350
than against the Scots.

29:06.520 --> 29:08.556
Would you have me
declare war

29:08.720 --> 29:11.280
on the entire Catholic
world, Mr. Cromwell?

29:11.520 --> 29:14.592
lt is your duty to
defend our church, sir.

29:15.560 --> 29:20.156
We are speaking now
of a matter of
international policy.

29:22.600 --> 29:28.675
ls Your Majesty sure
that it's not a matter
of domestic expediency?

29:28.920 --> 29:30.512
Come, sir!
l would remind you, sir,

29:30.720 --> 29:32.233
that you are
addressing your king.

29:32.400 --> 29:37.235
Mr. Cromwell,
you are impertinent.

29:38.280 --> 29:42.637
Such issues are beyond
good manners, sir.

29:44.120 --> 29:47.590
Catholicism is more
than a religion, it is
a political power.

29:48.040 --> 29:51.669
Therefore, l am led to believe
there will be no peace in lreland

29:51.920 --> 29:54.957
until the Catholic Church
is crushed.

29:56.800 --> 29:58.756
Your Majesty.

30:02.840 --> 30:06.879
CHARLES: These gentlemen
are from the Parliament.

30:32.840 --> 30:35.718
Your Majesty,
Parliament has drawn
up this document

30:35.920 --> 30:38.753
in which are set out
our main grievances.

30:38.960 --> 30:41.793
lt is our belief that
the demands made here

30:42.000 --> 30:44.275
are only those
that are just and lawful

30:44.480 --> 30:48.109
and in the best interests
of both Crown and kingdom.

30:48.320 --> 30:53.155
I shall examine these proposals
most carefully, Mr. Pym.

30:55.240 --> 30:57.037
Gentlemen.

31:18.160 --> 31:21.118
It is not too late,
my lord.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.434
You have the power still.

31:25.640 --> 31:30.191
And with God's help,
the strength to use
that power.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.514
Oh, my dearest Charles.

31:36.720 --> 31:40.429
I married you as a king
and as a man.

31:41.120 --> 31:47.195

do not disappoint me
in either aspect.

in Ireland must be
completely restored

practice freely without
interference or oppression.

be closed

and all Protestant bishops
and ministers removed
from office.

01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:35.710
Oh, there are one or
two other minor conditions
of little consequence.

01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:38.718
What you demand, Excellency,
would be a betrayal

01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:42.754

By whose command, sir?
By the command of Parliament, sir.

I know of no authority
in England above that
of the king.

01:21:47.240 --> 01:21:50.277

that this war was fought.

Does the army
have no say in this?

01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:36.276
The army has been

did we fight this war

that the politicians should
take over behind our backs?!

If Parliament has decided
the army will disband,

01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:46.078
then the army will disband.

01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:48.072

and march on Parliament.

The sword will
not rule this land.

01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:53.795
We fought to institute
a parliamentary system

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:58.596

which you now propose.

01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:01.030

to the king? Parliament?

l doubt it. l warrant
l know who is doing
all the talking.

01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:14.114
I have these past three days
been in consultation with
His Majesty the king.

And l am pleased
to inform the House

01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:20.037
that the king is now prepared
to discuss peace terms

that his wishes will be complied with.

Further, in recognition
of the very great debt

this House owes its commander,
General Cromwell,

01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:41.036
it is proposed to award him

It is further proposed that
the sum of 2000 pounds--

01:24:55.200 --> 01:25:01.036
Such low treachery
is not worthy even of you,
my Lord Manchester.

01:25:02.240 --> 01:25:05.471
Am I to believe my ears?

01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:08.035
Did this nation win
a bloody civil war

01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:11.437
in order the king should
dictate the terms of peace?

01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:14.951
l have already discussed
the matter at great length
with His Majesty--

01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:18.914

lt is a matter for this House
to discuss.

And the army will
not stand down until
the king comes to terms.

So if the king
will not talk to this House,

01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:36.516
then let the king
talk to the army.

01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:40.272
Out of the question.
The king would never agree.

If Your Majesty will be
so kind as to study
these proposals.

01:28:28.760 --> 01:28:32.230
Has Parliament approved this treaty?
Parliament no longer truly

01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:35.073

of this nation, Sir Edward.

01:28:35.240 --> 01:28:36.639

I represent the army, sir,

01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:46.556
and the army is the heart
and conscience of the people.

01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:51.635
So having failed to come
to terms with Parliament,

01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:54.991

<i>With 50,000 men

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:04.390
I could impose a government
on this nation overnight.

01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:09.071
One is given to wondering,
Mr. Cromwell, why you do not do that.

01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:12.033
I am deeply convinced,
my lord, it be the duty
of Parliament

01:29:12.240 --> 01:29:15.630
to frame a constitutional
government, and not the army.

01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:18.559
Then l do not see that
you have any need of me at all.

01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:21.190
On the contrary, sir.

01:29:21.400 --> 01:29:25.109
An England without
a king is unthinkable.

01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:28.392
But withal, a king
that can command respect

not from fear,

but by the affection
of a free people.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:38.595
Such a king could reunite
this great nation of ours

the noblest in all Christendom.

that inheritance, my lord,

be proud to call you king.

that l did greatly misjudge you,

as an ambitious man.

01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:07.594
While you negotiate
a settlement with him,

01:34:07.800 --> 01:34:11.509
he is planning
a second civil war.

01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:21.150
l do confess that l have
these many years given
my allegiance to a man

01:34:21.640 --> 01:34:25.189
not worthy of the title,
king of England.

01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:33.034
Colonel Harrison!

01:34:54.040 --> 01:34:56.873
I will have this king's head..

01:34:57.080 --> 01:35:02.200
Aye, and the Crown upon it.

01:35:04.720 --> 01:35:08.872
This obstinate king,
this man of blood,

01:35:09.080 --> 01:35:13.517
whose heart God
has hardened, can
no longer be trusted.

01:35:13.720 --> 01:35:18.350
For in prodigious treason,
he has revealed himself
to be a traitor.

01:35:18.560 --> 01:35:20.710
A man of no honour.

01:35:20.920 --> 01:35:25.675
A man unfitted to bear
the title, king of England.

l demand, therefore,
in the name of the army

01:35:31.160 --> 01:35:34.948

that Charles l, king of England,

upon pain of imprisonment.

Let the prisoner be brought in.

[CHATTERING]

01:37:03.440 --> 01:37:06.989
The clerk of arraigns
will read the charges.

01:37:09.960 --> 01:37:12.872
"Charles Stuart,
king of England,

01:37:13.080 --> 01:37:16.356
you stand before this court
charged with high treason.

01:37:16.560 --> 01:37:20.348
ln that being admitted
king of England, and
therein trusted with power

01:37:20.560 --> 01:37:24.599
to govern according
to the laws, you did out
of wickedness and design

01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:29.191
erect and uphold
in yourself an unlimited
and tyrannical power.

01:37:29.400 --> 01:37:33.598
To rule at your will
and overthrow the rights
and liberties of the people.

01:37:33.840 --> 01:37:38.960
And that you did
traitorously and maliciously
levy a cruel war

01:37:39.160 --> 01:37:41.071
against Parliament
and the people.

01:37:41.320 --> 01:37:47.031
And are therefore guilty
of all the treasons,
rapings, burnings, spoils,

01:37:47.240 --> 01:37:52.030
desolations, damages
and mischiefs to the nation
committed in the said war.

01:37:52.280 --> 01:37:55.352
Thus, on behalf
of the people of England,

01:37:55.560 --> 01:37:57.994
this court impeaches
you as a tyrant,

01:37:58.200 --> 01:38:03.149
traitor, murderer
and public enemy to the
Commonwealth of England."

JUDGE:
Silence!

01:38:10.480 --> 01:38:15.031
Sir, you have heard
the charges against you.

01:38:15.480 --> 01:38:17.710
The court expects
an answer.

01:38:17.920 --> 01:38:22.835
First, l would know
by what authority,
l mean lawful authority,

01:38:23.040 --> 01:38:26.953
l am brought here
and carried from place
to place, and l know not what.

01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:31.153
And by what authority
you presume to sit
in judgement on me.

01:38:31.880 --> 01:38:34.758
Remember,
l am your lawful king.

01:38:35.640 --> 01:38:37.392
Think well upon it.

01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:42.071
I have a trust committed
to me by God, by old
and lawful descent.

01:38:42.280 --> 01:38:45.909
Therefore, let me know
by what authority
I am brought here,

01:38:46.120 --> 01:38:47.553
and I shall answer.

01:38:48.040 --> 01:38:50.600
It is not for the prisoner
to question the court.

01:38:53.560 --> 01:38:56.677
I am no ordinary prisoner, sir.

01:38:57.760 --> 01:39:01.070
An answer, sir,
the court demands
an answer.

01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:04.758
Then I refuse an answer.

01:39:04.960 --> 01:39:07.952
Sir, you are before
a court of justice.

JUDGE:
The court will keep silent.

01:39:19.960 --> 01:39:22.713
Mr. Solicitor General,
are your witnesses prepared?

01:39:22.920 --> 01:39:25.593
They are, my lord.
Then let them be brought forth.

01:39:25.800 --> 01:39:29.031
Call Sir Edward Hyde.

01:39:35.200 --> 01:39:40.228
And you saw the king
and his wife alone
in their chambers

01:39:40.440 --> 01:39:44.479
with this Catholic
Archbishop Rinuccini?

01:39:44.680 --> 01:39:46.159
I did.

01:39:46.360 --> 01:39:49.750
And what did you
assume was the
purpose of this meeting?

01:39:58.840 --> 01:40:00.910
You are obliged
to answer, Sir Edward.

01:40:03.040 --> 01:40:04.792
To raise an Irish
army, my lord.

01:40:05.240 --> 01:40:08.755
To fight against
the Parliamentary forces?

01:40:10.200 --> 01:40:13.590
And at this time, was
the king in communication

01:40:13.800 --> 01:40:16.314
with any other
foreign power?

01:40:18.280 --> 01:40:23.274
Yes. Yes, with the king
of France and with the Dutch.

01:40:23.480 --> 01:40:26.552
For the same purpose?
Yes.

01:40:27.320 --> 01:40:32.314
To raise a foreign army
to invade this country,

01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:38.152
and to perpetuate
the war against the
people of this kingdom.

01:40:44.280 --> 01:40:46.555
Sir Edward?

01:40:49.880 --> 01:40:51.233
Yes.

[GAVEL POUNDS]

01:41:37.400 --> 01:41:40.995
Sir, throughout
the three days
of this hearing,

01:41:41.200 --> 01:41:44.476
this court has patiently
awaited your pleasure

01:41:44.680 --> 01:41:48.195
to hear what you have
to say in answer to the
charges against you.

01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:50.311
Yet you have declined
to speak.

01:41:50.520 --> 01:41:54.752
l am most willing, sir,
to answer before Parliament,

01:41:54.960 --> 01:41:57.713
but not before
this assembly

01:41:58.040 --> 01:42:01.635
whose authority
l refuse to acknowledge.

01:42:02.320 --> 01:42:05.949
Sir, what answers you may offer
the commons can be given here.

01:42:06.160 --> 01:42:09.436
For this court does
sit in the name of
the House of Commons.

01:42:10.040 --> 01:42:14.192
Sir, if, as you have said,
you do love the liberty
of the subject,

01:42:14.400 --> 01:42:18.598
you will grant me, your king,
a hearing before Parliament,

01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:22.395
which is the lords
and commons assembled.

01:42:23.320 --> 01:42:26.517
Sir, l submit you seek
only to delay the course
of justice.

01:42:26.880 --> 01:42:29.872
By your favour, sir,
l seek only those rights

01:42:30.080 --> 01:42:35.154
which, as your king,
I would grant to any
one of my subjects.

01:42:37.200 --> 01:42:38.838
JUDGE:
Silence!

01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:44.351
Sir, this court requires
to know if you have
anything to say

01:42:44.560 --> 01:42:47.393
before judgement
is passed upon you.

01:42:47.760 --> 01:42:50.832
I have nothing to say to you.

01:42:52.240 --> 01:42:55.312
Then this court will
retire to judgement.

01:42:59.040 --> 01:43:01.600
What ails thee?
Art thou mad?

01:43:01.800 --> 01:43:04.314
Have we come thus far
that you would betray us now?

01:43:04.520 --> 01:43:08.274
There is nothing in
the Constitution of
this land that entitles us

01:43:08.480 --> 01:43:11.711
to bring a king to trial.
ls he not answerable to his subjects?

01:43:11.920 --> 01:43:13.433
The trial is clearly
illegal, and l will have--

01:43:13.640 --> 01:43:16.518
ls not the king
answerable to his subjects?

01:43:16.720 --> 01:43:19.518
The king, sir,
is answerable only to God.

01:43:19.720 --> 01:43:22.280
Then, by God,
when he dies, he shall
have much to answer for.

01:43:22.480 --> 01:43:25.472
We have gone too far in this matter.
This commission has no authority--

01:43:25.720 --> 01:43:28.359
MAN 1 : Our authority
lies with the Parliament, sir.

01:43:28.560 --> 01:43:30.118
MAN 2:
Parliament is the law in this land.

01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:33.630
lf the charges against
this king be not proven,

01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:37.310
what terrible retribution
may he not bring down
upon our heads?

01:43:37.520 --> 01:43:39.238
In the name of God!

01:43:39.440 --> 01:43:42.637
What are we all?
Men?

01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:49.232
Cowering and quivering
like downtrodden serfs.

01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:56.028
The king is not England,
and England is not the king!

01:43:58.600 --> 01:44:04.436
lt is not the survival of
the king that is at issue here.

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:09.152
It is the survival of England.

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:16.348
And this king,
by his dishonesties,
by his treasons,

01:44:16.560 --> 01:44:19.757
and by his secret treaties
with foreign powers,

01:44:19.960 --> 01:44:26.069
has shown himself
to be ill-fitted to govern
this great nation!

01:44:29.040 --> 01:44:34.114
As God is my witness, Oliver,
I desire not the king's death,

01:44:34.320 --> 01:44:37.073
but the settlement
of this nation in peace.

01:44:37.600 --> 01:44:43.118
Do you think l don't desire that?
Go back to my farm and my family?

01:44:52.920 --> 01:44:57.232
Very well. Go again
to this king.

01:44:57.440 --> 01:45:00.000
Offer him once more
our terms.

01:45:00.200 --> 01:45:03.510
Though God knows,
he should be well acquainted
with them by now.

01:45:03.721 --> 01:45:06.110
Tell him he may sit
upon his throne,

01:45:06.320 --> 01:45:09.312
but that this country will be
governed by Parliament,

01:45:09.520 --> 01:45:12.830
and Parliament will be
elected by the people.

01:45:13.200 --> 01:45:18.638
Now, Sir Thomas,
if you can achieve this
where we have failed,

01:45:18.840 --> 01:45:21.638
this trial will end.

01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:39.118
Here is a warrant
demanding the death
of the king

01:45:39.320 --> 01:45:42.312
upon the charge of high
treason against this nation.

01:45:43.641 --> 01:45:48.715
lt will require all your
signatures. Sir Thomas.

01:45:51.721 --> 01:45:56.237
I have come thus far with you,
Oliver, in our great cause...

01:45:56.440 --> 01:46:00.069
but I will not sign
this warrant.

01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:23.431
Oliver, l cannot.
ls he guilty or not guilty?

01:46:23.640 --> 01:46:25.198
He is the king.
ls he guilty?

01:46:25.400 --> 01:46:27.516

in judgement upon you.
