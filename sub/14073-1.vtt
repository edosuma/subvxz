01:00.880 --> 01:02.336
I'm tired of

01:02.360 --> 01:03.793
this constant nagging.

01:03.920 --> 01:05.336
It's like you're turning into
one of your sisters.

01:05.360 --> 01:06.800
And I'm tired of your drinking

01:06.920 --> 01:08.096
and feeling sorry for yourself.

01:08.120 --> 01:09.553
Feeling sorry for myself?

01:09.680 --> 01:12.353
 I'll be the mechanic
of your heart... 

01:12.480 --> 01:14.056
Half the bloody country
is out of work.

01:14.080 --> 01:15.229
You're not that special.

01:15.360 --> 01:17.112
Oh, let me out of here.

01:17.240 --> 01:19.629
 And with a wrench,
I'll take you apart... 

01:19.760 --> 01:21.079
It's my bloody house.

01:21.200 --> 01:23.031
Your bloody house? Brilliant.

01:23.160 --> 01:25.441
I've been paying the mortgage
on it for the last 15 years.

01:25.560 --> 01:28.199
If we didn't share
a mortgage, I would leave you.

01:28.320 --> 01:30.515
 If we didn't
share a mortgage 

01:35.520 --> 01:36.919
I've had enough of it.

01:37.040 --> 01:38.680
Go on and leave
any time you like.

01:38.800 --> 01:41.360
 Go on and leave
any time you like... 

01:41.480 --> 01:43.198
Go on then, you stupid bitch.

01:45.920 --> 01:47.736
Though there are
still no accurate figures

01:47.760 --> 01:49.910
for the number of young
lrish people coming to London

01:50.040 --> 01:52.759
in search of work, the crude
indications that do exist

01:52.920 --> 01:54.433
show an enormous increase.

01:54.560 --> 01:56.516
Many take the boat
with barely enough money

01:56.640 --> 01:59.837
to survive a few days in
London, but still they emigrate

01:59.960 --> 02:01.632
because they see hope
across the sea,

02:01.760 --> 02:03.398
hope they cannot see in lreland.

02:11.160 --> 02:13.435
This meeting has been called
to order.

02:13.560 --> 02:15.357
Pray proceed.

02:15.480 --> 02:18.392
Well, as some of you
may have noticed,

02:18.520 --> 02:19.794
your mother and I really are

02:19.920 --> 02:21.400
under a lot of pressure
at the moment.

02:21.440 --> 02:22.919
Like the rest of the country.

02:23.040 --> 02:24.760
I haven't had a single
commission this year.

02:24.840 --> 02:26.831
Your mother is down
to a three-day week.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.275
It doesn't look like it's going
to get much brighter.

02:29.400 --> 02:31.072
So we had a look
at our accounts,

02:31.200 --> 02:33.873
and... well, we-we see we
could make a significant saving

02:34.000 --> 02:36.958
if we altered
the education situation.

02:37.080 --> 02:38.798
What education situation?

02:38.920 --> 02:40.558
- Well...
- She means your school.

02:40.720 --> 02:42.233
They're taking you
out of school.

02:42.360 --> 02:43.713
- What?
- No, no.

02:43.840 --> 02:45.319
We're not taking you
out of school.

02:45.440 --> 02:47.635
We're transferring you
from one school

02:47.760 --> 02:49.591
- to another school.
- Why?

02:49.720 --> 02:51.976
Because we need to make some
cuts in the budget somewhere.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.736
I'd suggest taking
your brother out of college,

02:53.760 --> 02:55.496
but he's already dropped out
of his own volition.

02:55.520 --> 02:56.748
Thank you, Robert.

02:56.880 --> 03:00.919
The Christian Brothers have
a fine history of education.

03:01.040 --> 03:02.314
Who are the Christian Brothers?

03:02.440 --> 03:04.176
The Christian Brothers
are an educational institution

03:04.200 --> 03:05.856
- formed by...
- The Christian Brothers, Conor,

03:05.880 --> 03:07.240
are an order
of the Catholic Church

03:07.360 --> 03:11.239
self-appointed
in their education formation

03:11.360 --> 03:13.874
and systematic beating
of their young charges.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.194
Oh, shut up, Brendan.

03:15.320 --> 03:16.496
Six years in the hands
of the Jesuits,

03:16.520 --> 03:18.078
and look what they did for you.

03:18.200 --> 03:20.395
You're just gonna have
to face up to this, Conor.

03:20.520 --> 03:22.136
Do you know what the
Christian Brothers' motto is?

03:22.160 --> 03:23.229
"Viriliter Age."

03:23.360 --> 03:24.759
Do you know what that means?

03:24.880 --> 03:25.920
"Let's rape our students"?

03:26.000 --> 03:27.592
No, Brendan, it doesn't.

03:27.720 --> 03:30.359
It means "act manly."

03:54.120 --> 03:56.000
What are you doing?
Get out of the bleedin' way.

04:55.560 --> 04:57.551
Morning, Brother Baxter.

05:00.640 --> 05:02.119
Sit down.

05:05.240 --> 05:07.754
- French, Brother Barnabas.
- Huh?

05:07.880 --> 05:09.677
You're teaching French,
not Latin.

05:09.800 --> 05:11.438
Oh, how modern.

05:11.560 --> 05:12.629
Mind you, I'd be surprised

05:12.760 --> 05:14.096
if any of you knew
where France is,

05:14.120 --> 05:16.395
not to mind speaking
the language.

05:16.520 --> 05:17.635
Oh, go on.

05:17.760 --> 05:20.274
It's on the continent.

05:20.400 --> 05:22.356
Above Spain.

05:22.480 --> 05:25.950
You'll be the new lad, then,
from the Jesuits.

05:27.600 --> 05:28.600
What's your name?

05:28.680 --> 05:29.874
Conor Lawlor.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.230
- Ooh! -Conor Lawlor?
- Shut up!

05:32.360 --> 05:34.920
Right, Conor. Morning prayers
are at quarter to 9:00.

05:35.040 --> 05:37.190
The canteen is located
just below the PE hall.

05:37.320 --> 05:39.880
They serve chips and bars.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.468
We have a strict black-shoe
policy here, Mr. Lawlor.

05:42.600 --> 05:44.670
Your parents should have
read it in the introductory

05:44.800 --> 05:46.836
rule book, page 142.

05:48.080 --> 05:50.150
I don't have black shoes, sir.

05:50.280 --> 05:53.477
Well, you're just going to have
to get a pair then, aren't you?

05:53.600 --> 05:55.875
And report to me first thing
in the morning with them.

05:56.040 --> 05:57.598
Good man.

05:57.720 --> 05:58.948
Brother.

05:59.080 --> 06:01.150
As you were.

06:03.520 --> 06:04.589
Sorry.

06:04.720 --> 06:07.518
Where did he say
the restaurant was again?

06:07.640 --> 06:09.119
Do you mean the canteen?

06:09.240 --> 06:10.719
Of course,
the can-canteen, yeah.

06:10.840 --> 06:12.432
"The restaurant."

06:12.600 --> 06:14.440
You're not in France now,
you bleedin' spanner.

06:23.520 --> 06:25.078
Do you smoke?

06:25.200 --> 06:27.077
- Do you?
- Occasionally.

06:27.240 --> 06:28.832
I'm not really a smoker.

06:28.960 --> 06:30.712
My brother is.
Uh, sometimes steal

06:30.840 --> 06:32.296
a bit of his tobacco
when my friends are over.

06:32.320 --> 06:34.515
So do you want to have
a smoke then or...?

06:34.640 --> 06:37.154
- Here? -Come on, we'll have
a smoke. Come on, follow me.

06:37.280 --> 06:38.952
Come on.

06:40.920 --> 06:42.433
Here, do you want one?

06:42.560 --> 06:43.754
Nah, I'm okay.

06:43.920 --> 06:45.638
I already had two this morning.

06:45.800 --> 06:47.552
Actually, look at this yoke.

06:47.680 --> 06:49.830
It's a Black Widow.

06:49.960 --> 06:51.029
Savage.

06:52.480 --> 06:55.074
- Now, I hear you're a queer.
- What?

06:55.200 --> 06:56.713
Yeah, I hear
you're a little queer.

06:56.840 --> 06:59.035
No, you must have me mixed up
with someone else.

06:59.160 --> 07:00.752
Nah, I don't think so.

07:00.880 --> 07:02.711
Dance.

07:02.840 --> 07:04.432
- Dance?
- Dance!

07:04.560 --> 07:05.993
Dance, like a little queer, go.

07:06.120 --> 07:07.120
Are you joking?

07:12.160 --> 07:13.559
Jig.

07:13.680 --> 07:15.352
Move it.

07:15.480 --> 07:16.993
No, more arms.

07:17.160 --> 07:19.720
Uh, yeah, disco, kind of.

07:19.840 --> 07:21.751
Now dance with your pants down.

07:21.880 --> 07:22.915
What?

07:23.040 --> 07:24.917
Hmm. Get into that cubicle,

07:25.040 --> 07:27.315
dance with your pants down.

07:28.520 --> 07:29.839
No.

07:29.960 --> 07:31.359
What did you just say?

07:31.480 --> 07:34.677
Uh, I'm not, I'm not doing that.

07:41.360 --> 07:43.237
It's Thursday.

07:43.360 --> 07:44.839
It's 7:00.

07:44.960 --> 07:47.076
It's Top of the Pops.

07:47.200 --> 07:51.273
Conor, Brendan,
come on, it's 7:00!

07:51.400 --> 07:52.760
They can't be here tonight,

07:52.880 --> 07:54.518
as they are in the USA,

07:54.640 --> 07:58.110
so instead we have to go to Rio.

07:58.240 --> 08:00.071
It's Duran Duran.

08:00.200 --> 08:01.976
Hey, we're working here.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.309
So are we.

08:04.440 --> 08:05.919
This is my homework, Brendan.

08:06.040 --> 08:07.736
I have a really important essay
due in the morning.

08:07.760 --> 08:09.336
Just because you've given up
on your dreams

08:09.360 --> 08:11.396
doesn't mean we have to,
all right?

08:11.520 --> 08:12.999
Can we put the fire on?

08:13.120 --> 08:14.838
No.

08:14.960 --> 08:17.633
You're gonna love this, man.

08:17.760 --> 08:19.591
Yes! Beautiful.

08:25.800 --> 08:28.234
The jury's still out
on which way these guys'll go,

08:28.400 --> 08:30.391
but they're a lot of fun,
and John Taylor

08:30.520 --> 08:32.135
is one of the most proficient
bass players

08:32.159 --> 08:33.957
in the UK at the moment.

08:34.080 --> 08:35.354
Gives them a really funky edge,

08:35.480 --> 08:36.799
which I hope
they're gonna go for.

08:40.480 --> 08:43.232
Hey, it's not exactly
the Beatles, is it?

08:43.360 --> 08:45.016
Oh, you know, will you go
outside and start up

08:45.040 --> 08:46.776
the time machine there
so we can all go back in time

08:46.800 --> 08:48.680
- for Dad, Conor.
- Well, if this is the future,

08:48.760 --> 08:51.320
we're all screwed, aren't we?
I mean, look at this guy.

08:51.440 --> 08:52.998
He's not even singing live.

08:53.120 --> 08:54.394
It's a video, Robert.

08:54.520 --> 08:56.033
It's art.

08:56.160 --> 08:58.355
Everybody's making them
these days. Look at it.

09:01.600 --> 09:03.955
He's very attractive, though,
isn't he?

09:04.080 --> 09:05.080
You're welcome to him.

09:05.200 --> 09:06.349
Promise?

09:07.600 --> 09:09.192
Who's that guitarist?

09:09.360 --> 09:10.395
John Taylor.

09:10.520 --> 09:11.589
All the girls love him.

09:11.720 --> 09:13.472
Cute, isn't he, Ann?

09:13.600 --> 09:14.669
And he's not a guitarist.

09:14.800 --> 09:17.394
- He's a bassist.
- Yeah, Ann.

09:17.520 --> 09:19.280
I mean, why can't they
get them to play live?

09:19.360 --> 09:20.713
What are they trying to hide?

09:20.840 --> 09:22.120
It's because they're in the USA.

09:22.240 --> 09:23.240
Did you not hear him?

09:23.280 --> 09:25.111
And this lasts forever.

09:25.240 --> 09:28.994
It's the perfect mixture
of music and visuals.

09:29.120 --> 09:30.872
It's short, to the point.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.319
Look at it.

09:33.800 --> 09:36.872
I mean, what tyranny
could stand up to that?

09:46.600 --> 09:48.477
Good morning, Mr. Lawlor.

09:55.920 --> 09:59.230
Well, I brought it up
with my mum, but she said

09:59.360 --> 10:02.511
we can't afford another pair
at the moment.

10:06.280 --> 10:09.238
I bought these before I knew
about the shoe color policy

10:09.360 --> 10:11.749
here at Synge Street.

10:11.920 --> 10:14.559
But it's not as if
they're runners or something.

10:14.680 --> 10:16.033
They're... they're brown.

10:16.160 --> 10:18.435
They're-they're quite sensible.

10:18.560 --> 10:20.994
They're not black.

10:21.120 --> 10:24.317
I'm-I'm not sure
what you want me to do.

10:24.440 --> 10:26.078
Take them off.

10:26.200 --> 10:28.316
You can leave them
at the door there.

10:28.480 --> 10:30.311
Seeing as you're so fond
of them,

10:30.480 --> 10:33.040
you can pick them up here
at 4:00 every day

10:33.160 --> 10:35.628
until you comply with the rules
of the school.

10:35.760 --> 10:37.557
What?

10:37.680 --> 10:39.477
See you.

11:05.360 --> 11:07.351
Could I have a Mars bar, please?

11:07.520 --> 11:09.078
25p.

11:09.200 --> 11:11.509
Thank you.

11:17.840 --> 11:19.592
Here.

11:25.600 --> 11:27.079
Ooh!

11:44.480 --> 11:45.959
You should've just danced.

11:51.280 --> 11:52.508
Who is that psycho?

11:52.640 --> 11:54.153
That's Barry Bray.

11:54.280 --> 11:56.999
- He'll be out for your blood
for the year. -Why?

11:57.120 --> 11:58.951
'Cause you've shown
signs of weakness.

11:59.080 --> 12:00.832
So how do you know him?

12:00.960 --> 12:02.678
He lives in the same flat as me.

12:02.800 --> 12:04.472
His ma and da are drugs addicts.

12:04.600 --> 12:05.999
But don't worry.

12:06.160 --> 12:08.276
You just need to come up
with a plan for the year.

12:08.400 --> 12:09.594
A solution.

12:09.720 --> 12:12.518
Here.

12:12.640 --> 12:14.596
Check it out.

12:14.720 --> 12:17.393
"Darren Mulvey
Business Solutions."

12:17.520 --> 12:18.839
Call me anytime.

12:18.960 --> 12:19.995
There's no number on it.

12:20.120 --> 12:21.320
Oh, no, we don't have a phone.

12:21.440 --> 12:22.793
Just call around, yeah?

12:24.320 --> 12:25.435
Who's she?

12:25.560 --> 12:26.879
I don't know.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.513
She's always there.

12:28.680 --> 12:30.352
She's beautiful.

12:30.480 --> 12:31.629
Yeah, good luck.

12:31.760 --> 12:33.239
She doesn't speak to anyone.

12:33.360 --> 12:34.679
Stuck-up cow.

12:34.800 --> 12:36.472
She said her boyfriend's
a drug dealer.

12:36.600 --> 12:38.416
She's not interested
in any of the boys in school.

12:38.440 --> 12:41.591
Then why is she standing
over there every morning, then?

13:01.920 --> 13:03.273
Need a light?

13:05.360 --> 13:07.078
No. I'm trying to give up.

13:07.200 --> 13:09.350
I don't have any matches anyway.

13:11.240 --> 13:13.117
So, how come
you're not in school?

13:13.240 --> 13:14.832
I don't go to school.

13:14.960 --> 13:16.109
I'm a model.

13:16.240 --> 13:18.117
Cool, like, for magazines?

13:18.240 --> 13:20.037
I'm going to London soon.

13:20.160 --> 13:22.071
Just waiting
for my portfolio shots.

13:22.200 --> 13:25.033
There's no real work
for models in Dublin, you know?

13:25.160 --> 13:28.709
Yeah, tell me about it.

13:28.840 --> 13:31.354
Do you want to be in a video?

13:31.480 --> 13:32.708
It's for my band.

13:32.840 --> 13:34.637
You're in a band?

13:34.760 --> 13:37.354
Yes, and we need a girl for it.

13:37.480 --> 13:39.311
Have you ever been
in a video before?

13:39.440 --> 13:40.509
No.

13:40.640 --> 13:42.790
Is that a problem?

13:42.920 --> 13:44.194
I hope not.

13:44.320 --> 13:45.435
I'll ask the producer.

13:45.560 --> 13:46.754
Who's the producer?

13:46.880 --> 13:48.757
That kid behind me.

13:51.960 --> 13:54.349
I could call you
with the details,

13:54.520 --> 13:56.192
if I had your digits.

13:59.920 --> 14:03.230
So, if you're in a band,
sing me a song.

14:03.400 --> 14:05.630
I can't sing out here.

14:05.760 --> 14:08.069
You're gonna have to sing for,
like, thousands of people.

14:08.240 --> 14:09.559
I'm just one.

14:09.680 --> 14:10.680
Sing.

14:10.760 --> 14:12.478
Don't make me sing.

14:12.600 --> 14:14.556
Jesus.

14:14.680 --> 14:15.908
Sing that song off the radio.

14:16.080 --> 14:17.354
You know, the one by A-ha.

14:17.480 --> 14:19.391
Sing it.

14:19.520 --> 14:21.556
Sing it.

14:21.680 --> 14:23.318
Sorry.

14:24.640 --> 14:25.640
No, it's too low.

14:36.520 --> 14:38.238
That's all I know.

14:48.120 --> 14:49.712
Cool, bye.

14:55.480 --> 14:57.869
- We need to form a band.
- What?

15:07.960 --> 15:09.359
How are you, Darren?

15:09.480 --> 15:10.913
- Is Eamon there?
- Eamon?

15:12.520 --> 15:13.520
Hey, Eamon.

15:13.680 --> 15:14.715
What are you doing?

15:14.840 --> 15:15.955
Nothing really.

15:16.080 --> 15:17.433
Just feeding me new bunny.

15:17.600 --> 15:20.160
Conor, this is Eamon.
Eamon, this is Conor.

15:20.280 --> 15:21.976
Conor's new in school, and
he's putting a band together.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.719
Oh, good Jesus.

15:24.840 --> 15:26.637
So?

15:31.200 --> 15:32.428
Wow.

15:32.560 --> 15:33.834
Where'd you get all this gear?

15:33.960 --> 15:35.632
Me da's in a covers band.

15:35.760 --> 15:37.955
Weddings, parties, pubs.

15:38.120 --> 15:39.736
Eamon can play every instrument
known to mankind.

15:39.760 --> 15:41.352
Can't you, Eamon?

15:41.480 --> 15:43.072
Probably.

15:43.200 --> 15:44.519
Show him.

15:49.920 --> 15:50.989
Check it.

16:05.160 --> 16:06.600
So what do you think...

16:17.480 --> 16:19.550
So, what do you play yourself?

16:21.640 --> 16:22.868
I'm more of a singer.

16:23.040 --> 16:25.838
I write songs, words, lyrics.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.195
But I haven't put them
to music yet.

16:28.320 --> 16:29.696
What kind of music
are yous gonna be doing?

16:29.720 --> 16:31.472
Well, I-I don't know yet.

16:31.600 --> 16:32.874
What d'you mean you don't know?

16:33.000 --> 16:34.096
You have to know
what you're gonna be playing.

16:34.120 --> 16:35.599
What are you into?

16:35.760 --> 16:37.034
I'm a futurist.

16:37.160 --> 16:38.912
What does that mean?

16:39.040 --> 16:41.031
Like, uh, no nostalgia.

16:41.160 --> 16:42.912
Not like your da's band.

16:43.040 --> 16:44.837
Not looking backwards,
just forwards.

16:44.960 --> 16:47.155
Oh, cool. Like Depeche Mode?

16:47.280 --> 16:49.555
- Okay.
- Or Joy Division?

16:49.680 --> 16:51.511
Right.

16:51.640 --> 16:52.993
Or Duran Duran?

16:53.120 --> 16:54.951
What do you think of them?

16:57.160 --> 17:00.072
Jury is out on which way
those guys'll go.

17:00.200 --> 17:01.792
They're a lot of fun,
and James Taylor

17:01.920 --> 17:03.592
is one of the most
proficient bass players

17:03.720 --> 17:07.030
in the UK at the moment,
giving them a funky edge.

17:08.640 --> 17:09.709
John Taylor.

17:09.880 --> 17:11.836
Yeah, John. Of course.

17:14.920 --> 17:16.239
I'll be in your band.

17:16.359 --> 17:17.554
I'll play guitar.

17:17.720 --> 17:19.438
And I'll help write songs.

17:19.599 --> 17:20.999
We could rehearse here

17:21.119 --> 17:23.076
'cause my da's
in Saint John of Gods.

17:23.200 --> 17:24.791
- Is that a pub?
- No, Darren.

17:24.920 --> 17:27.150
It's a place where alcoholics
go to get off the drink,

17:27.280 --> 17:29.077
stop beating up
their wives and kids.

17:29.200 --> 17:30.474
Right.

17:30.600 --> 17:32.113
And neighbors.

17:32.240 --> 17:33.878
Who's gonna be the manager?

17:34.000 --> 17:35.797
Me.

17:35.920 --> 17:37.353
Have you managed bands before?

17:37.480 --> 17:39.072
No, I'm just breaking
into the market.

17:39.240 --> 17:40.456
Got to get everything straight.

17:40.480 --> 17:41.913
Get everything down
on paper first.

17:42.080 --> 17:43.376
Otherwise,
the major record labels

17:43.400 --> 17:44.656
can rip you off
when they come hunting.

17:44.680 --> 17:46.318
That's what me da says.

17:48.360 --> 17:49.554
When'd you want to rehearse?

17:49.680 --> 17:51.477
Not at the weekends.

17:51.600 --> 17:53.456
He's got a job packing shelves
in Quinnsworth on Saturdays.

17:53.480 --> 17:55.096
You're not giving that up
for any band, d'you hear me?

17:55.120 --> 17:56.519
Yeah.

17:56.640 --> 17:58.517
What about Mondays
and Wednesdays after school?

17:58.680 --> 17:59.908
That's fine.

18:00.040 --> 18:01.917
Sounds good.

18:02.040 --> 18:03.473
Now all we need
is other musicians.

18:03.640 --> 18:04.755
Do yous know any?

18:04.880 --> 18:06.598
- No.
- Eamon?

18:06.720 --> 18:08.233
He usually just plays
on his own.

18:08.360 --> 18:09.360
Don't you, love?

18:09.480 --> 18:10.674
Right, well,

18:10.800 --> 18:12.074
we can't get any peace in here.

18:12.200 --> 18:14.555
Let's continue
this meeting outside.

18:15.800 --> 18:17.233
No smoking now.

18:17.360 --> 18:19.351
Ma, how many times
do I have to tell you?

18:19.480 --> 18:20.754
I don't smoke.

18:22.680 --> 18:25.114
There's a black guy in 3B.

18:25.240 --> 18:26.639
So?

18:26.760 --> 18:28.671
- Be cool if he was in the band.
- Why?

18:28.800 --> 18:30.616
He's probably the one black guy
in the whole school.

18:30.640 --> 18:32.278
Probably in Dublin.

18:32.400 --> 18:34.360
Having a golliwog in the band
give us a real edge.

18:34.440 --> 18:35.509
You can't say "golliwog."

18:35.640 --> 18:36.834
Why not?

18:36.960 --> 18:38.359
Trust me, you just can't.

18:38.480 --> 18:40.160
And anyway, what if
he can't play anything?

18:40.240 --> 18:42.356
He'll be able
to play something; he's black.

18:55.200 --> 18:57.111
- Wow.
- Can I help you?

18:57.280 --> 18:59.316
Is this the house
where the colored lad lives?

18:59.440 --> 19:00.509
Four doors down.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.039
What do you think?

19:02.200 --> 19:03.416
How many black people
do you think

19:03.440 --> 19:04.919
that lives
on this shitty estate?

19:05.080 --> 19:07.116
- Do you know Ngig?
- What's that?

19:07.240 --> 19:09.515
Ngig. My son.

19:09.640 --> 19:12.000
We're putting a band together.
Does he play any instruments?

19:12.120 --> 19:13.951
Why don't you ask him yourself?

19:14.080 --> 19:16.389
We are putting

19:16.520 --> 19:20.274
a band together.

19:20.400 --> 19:23.039
I am the manager.

19:23.160 --> 19:24.912
What the hell is wrong with him?

19:26.440 --> 19:28.590
Oh, you, um,
sound different from your mam.

19:28.720 --> 19:30.256
Course I do; been here
half me bleedin' life.

19:30.280 --> 19:31.429
What'd you think?

19:31.560 --> 19:33.596
Would you have any interest
in playing in a band?

19:33.720 --> 19:35.199
What kind of music
are yous playing?

19:35.360 --> 19:37.191
We're not
a hundred percent sure yet,

19:37.360 --> 19:39.032
but do you play any instruments?

19:40.920 --> 19:42.069
Maybe.

19:43.400 --> 19:45.789
"Futurist band forming.

19:45.920 --> 19:47.672
Looking for
a bass player, drummer."

19:47.800 --> 19:48.949
That's us.

19:49.120 --> 19:50.872
"Influences include
Depeche Mode,

19:51.040 --> 19:52.359
Duran Duran and many more."

19:52.480 --> 19:54.277
- Faggots.
- Piss off, Ryan.

19:54.400 --> 19:58.313
"Contact Management Solutions,
361 at St. Theresa's Gardens.

19:58.440 --> 19:59.668
No telephone, just call in."

19:59.840 --> 20:01.512
Sounds like a gig for us.

20:01.640 --> 20:02.834
Let's go.

20:04.480 --> 20:06.436
So what are we called, then?

20:06.600 --> 20:08.192
All right, what about...

20:08.320 --> 20:09.639
The Rabbits?

20:09.760 --> 20:11.591
What's the story
with you and rabbits?

20:11.720 --> 20:13.517
I don't know, I just love them.

20:13.640 --> 20:15.710
What about La Vie?

20:15.840 --> 20:17.114
What's that mean?

20:17.240 --> 20:18.878
It's French for "The Life."

20:19.000 --> 20:20.416
What's French for, uh,
"That's not gonna be

20:20.440 --> 20:21.509
the name of the band"?

20:21.640 --> 20:23.756
C'est nes pas le nom du groupe.

20:23.880 --> 20:24.880
There you go.

20:24.920 --> 20:27.388
What about... Sing Street?

20:27.520 --> 20:29.750
Do you actually not
get that like?

20:29.880 --> 20:31.233
Sing Street.

20:31.360 --> 20:32.679
- Oh!
- I like that.

20:32.800 --> 20:35.075
- Gobshites.
- Yeah, I like it.

21:11.440 --> 21:13.715
 Moving on the floor now,
babe 

21:38.000 --> 21:41.549
 Twisting through
a dusty land 

21:45.960 --> 21:50.590
 She really shows you
all she can 

21:52.720 --> 21:56.395
 Dance across
the Rio Grande. 

22:07.160 --> 22:10.311
- Sped up a bit there at the end.
- Really?

22:10.440 --> 22:12.829
- That sounded great.
- Yeah, we sound deadly.

22:12.960 --> 22:15.315
Oh, lads, we're gonna be amazing.

22:17.400 --> 22:18.992
What are you doing?

22:19.120 --> 22:20.840
I'm just letting
the stink of that out, man.

22:20.920 --> 22:22.069
Whew.

22:22.200 --> 22:23.838
That was bad, bad music.

22:23.960 --> 22:27.270
And there is nothing as bad
in this world as bad music.

22:27.400 --> 22:29.675
- You know you can record
over tapes? -No.

22:31.440 --> 22:32.839
That was a novelty act.

22:32.960 --> 22:35.076
You want to have actual
sexual intercourse, right?

22:35.200 --> 22:36.918
- Yeah. What, what?
- The girl.

22:37.080 --> 22:38.376
It's all about the girl,
isn't it?

22:38.400 --> 22:40.550
- Yeah, the girl, yeah.
- And you're gonna use

22:40.680 --> 22:42.336
somebody else's art to get her?
Are you kidding?

22:42.360 --> 22:43.395
We're just starting.

22:43.520 --> 22:44.919
We need to learn how to play.

22:45.040 --> 22:46.632
Did the Sex Pistols
know how to play?

22:46.800 --> 22:48.496
You don't need to know
how to play. Who are you?

22:48.520 --> 22:51.478
Steely Dan? You need to learn
how not to play, Conor.

22:51.640 --> 22:53.756
That's the trick.
That's rock and roll.

22:53.880 --> 22:56.030
And that takes practice.

22:56.160 --> 22:58.230
And you're not a covers band,
by the way.

22:58.360 --> 22:59.634
- Really?
- No.

22:59.760 --> 23:01.193
Every school has a covers band.

23:01.320 --> 23:02.992
Every pub has a covers band.

23:03.120 --> 23:04.553
Every wedding has a covers band.

23:04.680 --> 23:06.716
And every covers band
has a middle-aged member

23:06.840 --> 23:08.496
who'll never know
whether they could've made it

23:08.520 --> 23:09.640
in the music industry or not

23:09.760 --> 23:10.976
because they never had the balls

23:11.000 --> 23:12.319
to write a song
for someone else.

23:12.440 --> 23:14.556
Rock and roll is a risk.

23:14.680 --> 23:17.194
You risk being ridiculed.

23:17.320 --> 23:18.736
But I don't know
how to write a song.

23:18.760 --> 23:19.920
Close that door and sit down.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.456
- Really?
- It's gonna be a long night.

23:21.480 --> 23:22.560
I've school in the morning.

23:22.600 --> 23:25.034
This is school.

23:25.160 --> 23:27.037
"She's standing on the corner

23:27.160 --> 23:28.912
"like an angel in disguise.

23:29.040 --> 23:31.759
"I want to try and warn her.

23:31.880 --> 23:34.519
She's got dangerous eyes."

23:34.680 --> 23:36.591
"Dangerous eyes."

23:36.720 --> 23:38.438
I like that.

23:38.600 --> 23:39.999
What does it mean?

23:40.120 --> 23:41.792
I don't know.

23:41.920 --> 23:43.319
What's the song about, Conor?

23:45.480 --> 23:47.357
It's like
when you don't know someone,

23:47.480 --> 23:49.072
they're more interesting.

23:49.200 --> 23:51.430
They can be
anything you want them to be.

23:51.560 --> 23:52.560
Yeah.

23:52.640 --> 23:55.871
But when you know them,

23:56.000 --> 23:57.353
there's limits to them.

23:57.480 --> 23:59.675
No, that doesn't make any sense.

23:59.800 --> 24:01.597
What's it called?

24:01.720 --> 24:03.472
"The Riddle of the Model."

24:03.600 --> 24:05.431
So what about a rhythm
like this?

24:10.600 --> 24:12.397
Nice.

24:12.520 --> 24:13.839
Slow it down a little.

24:16.440 --> 24:18.556
Yeah.

24:18.680 --> 24:20.955
Yeah, that's cool, that's it.

24:29.800 --> 24:30.915
I've an idea.

24:31.040 --> 24:32.320
Maybe for the chorus, like, a...

24:45.400 --> 24:47.072
Yeah.

24:50.120 --> 24:52.190
Yeah. There you can do a stop.

24:52.320 --> 24:53.600
- Yeah.
- And I come in and sing.

24:54.920 --> 24:56.114
Like, would everybody stop?

24:56.240 --> 24:57.840
- Yeah. Yeah, everyone.
- Like, the drums

24:57.880 --> 24:59.871
- will do a...
- Yeah.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.228
No, yeah. We-we all stop.

25:01.360 --> 25:03.555
- Fireworks and lights and shit.
I don't know. -Yeah.

25:03.680 --> 25:05.238
- Everyone.
- And they all...

25:05.360 --> 25:06.616
- Everyone stops, yeah.
- Crazy shit, that'd be cool.

25:06.640 --> 25:08.153
- I like that.
- Yeah, yeah.

25:08.280 --> 25:09.793
So maybe like a...

25:15.120 --> 25:16.616
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I like that. That's good.

25:16.640 --> 25:17.656
- Yeah, that's cool.
- Yeah.

25:17.680 --> 25:18.999
Do you, do you have a hoover?

25:19.160 --> 25:20.354
Check out this effect.

25:20.480 --> 25:22.152
It's like "Video Killed
the Radio Star."

25:22.280 --> 25:23.918
Go.

25:31.120 --> 25:33.554
 Like an angel
in disguise... 

25:33.680 --> 25:35.477
Hey.

25:35.600 --> 25:36.476
How's it going?

25:36.600 --> 25:37.874
Uh, here's the tape.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.672
What's this?

25:39.800 --> 25:41.995
Oh, that's the song;
I mentioned it to you.

25:42.120 --> 25:44.759
Oh, you're the kid in the band.

25:46.320 --> 25:48.197
Yeah, you should probably
learn the lyrics.

25:48.320 --> 25:50.151
So you can lip-sync
to them properly.

25:50.280 --> 25:52.336
We're shooting at the lane
at the back of Quinnsworth.

25:52.360 --> 25:53.952
- You know Quinnsworth?
- Yeah.

25:54.080 --> 25:55.115
This Saturday at 12:00.

25:55.280 --> 25:57.510
Cool. Well, I'll try
and make it.

25:57.640 --> 25:58.675
What would I wear?

25:58.800 --> 25:59.994
I don't know.

26:00.160 --> 26:01.513
It's kind of like
a Chinese theme.

26:01.640 --> 26:03.312
So, like, a kimono?

26:03.440 --> 26:05.635
Well, it's more like a riff
than a song.

26:07.760 --> 26:10.911
More of an Eastern bit
in the song.

26:11.040 --> 26:13.508
It's called
"The Riddle of the Model."

26:16.160 --> 26:17.434
That's really sweet.

26:17.560 --> 26:18.595
Oh.

26:18.760 --> 26:20.432
No, it's not about you.

26:20.560 --> 26:22.039
It's about another model I know.

26:22.160 --> 26:23.593
Oh.

26:23.720 --> 26:25.392
Right, well,
I'll give it a listen,

26:25.560 --> 26:28.916
but I'm, like, really,
really busy at the moment.

26:29.040 --> 26:30.598
You know, so I'll try.

26:30.720 --> 26:33.473
Yeah, you should.
It's a, it's a good song.

26:33.600 --> 26:36.160
We've got a great team.

26:36.320 --> 26:38.231
It's a really good opportunity.

26:38.360 --> 26:39.588
Cool.

26:39.720 --> 26:41.199
So this Saturday
at 12:00, then?

26:41.320 --> 26:43.550
12:00. Sounds good.

26:43.680 --> 26:44.829
- Thanks.
- Cool.

26:44.960 --> 26:46.757
Bye.

26:53.560 --> 26:56.313
Looks like loads of gear
back home, doesn't it?

26:56.440 --> 26:59.477
And yet, strangely,
it just looks like shit here.

26:59.600 --> 27:01.636
Yeah.

27:01.760 --> 27:03.751
Ah, hey, where is this chick?

27:05.000 --> 27:06.638
I don't know.

27:06.760 --> 27:09.228
Who the hell
brought a cowboy costume?

27:09.360 --> 27:11.794
Me. It's all I could find.

27:11.920 --> 27:14.036
No one wears
a cowboy costume in a band.

27:14.160 --> 27:15.536
There's a cowboy
in the Village People.

27:15.560 --> 27:16.560
And Adam Ant.

27:16.640 --> 27:18.358
Adam Ant is a highwayman.

27:18.480 --> 27:21.597
So we can have a highwayman,
but we can't have a cowboy?

27:21.720 --> 27:23.711
Are you mentally ill?

27:23.840 --> 27:25.990
I got fangs in the joke shop.

27:26.160 --> 27:28.000
What are you gonna do with them?

27:29.520 --> 27:30.873
It's a music video,

27:31.040 --> 27:32.996
- not a bleedin' horror film.
- Spanner.

27:33.120 --> 27:35.350
So what did yous bring?

27:41.920 --> 27:43.353
It's me da's show band outfit.

27:43.480 --> 27:44.629
So it's a gay band?

27:44.760 --> 27:45.760
Okay.

27:45.880 --> 27:47.016
Coming from the one who wants

27:47.040 --> 27:48.359
to look like the Village People.

27:48.520 --> 27:49.920
What's gay about
the Village People?

27:50.000 --> 27:51.399
Hello, all. Sorry I'm late.

27:51.560 --> 27:53.073
I was out last night.

27:53.200 --> 27:55.350
At a nightclub.

27:55.480 --> 27:57.710
Jesus Christ,
what are you all wearing?

27:57.840 --> 27:59.831
Yeah, we're just
working that out.

27:59.960 --> 28:01.439
Um, maybe you can help.

28:01.560 --> 28:03.073
Well, who's your costume person?

28:03.240 --> 28:06.312
We don't really have
a costume person.

28:06.440 --> 28:07.456
Well, who's your cameraman?

28:07.480 --> 28:09.710
Maybe he can make
some of this work.

28:09.840 --> 28:11.478
Well, we don't really have...

28:11.600 --> 28:12.669
I'm the cameraman.

28:12.800 --> 28:14.000
Thought you were the producer.

28:14.120 --> 28:15.348
And the cameraman.

28:15.480 --> 28:17.118
Saving money at all costs, yeah.

28:26.240 --> 28:27.593
What'd you think of the song?

28:27.720 --> 28:28.835
I really liked it.

28:28.960 --> 28:30.598
It's the only reason I'm here.

28:30.720 --> 28:31.869
Did you write it?

28:32.000 --> 28:33.433
Eamon wrote most of the music.

28:33.560 --> 28:34.913
So you wrote the lyrics?

28:35.040 --> 28:36.155
Cool.

28:37.880 --> 28:39.313
You've got
really good cheekbones.

28:39.440 --> 28:40.759
- What?
- Yeah.

28:40.880 --> 28:43.599
Yeah, you should let me
do your makeup.

28:43.720 --> 28:45.836
- Really? -Yeah.
Now this light's gonna be

28:45.960 --> 28:47.029
really harsh on camera.

28:47.200 --> 28:48.599
It'll take the edge off.

28:48.720 --> 28:50.278
I'm actually
wearing some right now.

28:51.520 --> 28:52.714
In fact,

28:52.840 --> 28:54.273
you should all
be wearing makeup.

28:54.400 --> 28:55.896
Yeah,
I'm not wearing any makeup.

28:55.920 --> 28:57.672
Relax,
you're not even in the band.

28:57.800 --> 28:59.279
Yeah, thank God.

28:59.400 --> 29:00.913
I'm in the band, and I will not

29:01.040 --> 29:02.598
be wearing any makeup.
Thank you.

29:02.760 --> 29:04.113
Why? You've got great lips.

29:04.240 --> 29:05.680
No, piss off.
I'm not wearing makeup.

29:05.720 --> 29:07.312
Whatever.

29:07.440 --> 29:09.237
Those of you who actually
care about the band

29:09.360 --> 29:12.033
and want to do this half
properly, queue over there.

29:12.160 --> 29:14.913
Okay, so we're playing
over here,

29:15.040 --> 29:16.736
and Raphina's standing
over there against the wall.

29:16.760 --> 29:18.320
I go up to you
and start singing to you.

29:18.480 --> 29:20.038
Make sure to pan up to her eyes

29:20.160 --> 29:21.896
when I sing the line,
"She's got dangerous eyes."

29:21.920 --> 29:23.433
I think a zoom would be better.

29:23.560 --> 29:25.118
Okay, a zoom, whatever.

29:25.280 --> 29:26.776
Do you think I should have,
like, lightning flashes

29:26.800 --> 29:28.313
on my eyelids when I close 'em?

29:28.440 --> 29:29.440
Can you do that?

29:29.560 --> 29:30.675
I can do anything.

29:30.800 --> 29:32.233
Cool.

29:32.360 --> 29:34.749
So then for the chorus,
you walk off and I follow,

29:34.880 --> 29:36.480
circling you like
when he's following her

29:36.560 --> 29:37.560
in the "Thriller" video.

29:37.680 --> 29:39.557
- Have you seen the "Thriller" video?
- Yeah.

29:39.680 --> 29:41.511
Cool. So then I follow you
up the laneway,

29:41.640 --> 29:42.976
keeping behind you,
and then we'll swing around

29:43.000 --> 29:44.319
and get the angle in front.

29:44.440 --> 29:46.280
- Let's shoot it.
- Right, let's shoot.

29:46.360 --> 29:48.157
It's just some kids
filming something.

29:48.280 --> 29:49.838
What are yous filming, lads?

29:52.360 --> 29:53.679
A video for a band.

29:53.800 --> 29:54.915
Hi, Barry.

29:55.040 --> 29:56.519
Are these in your school, Barry?

29:56.640 --> 29:58.756
Yeah, they are, yeah.

29:58.880 --> 30:00.438
But they're wearing
bleedin' makeup.

30:00.560 --> 30:01.754
I know.

30:01.880 --> 30:03.216
Oh, yous making a movie,
lads, is it?

30:03.240 --> 30:04.593
Nah, it's just
a video for a band.

30:04.720 --> 30:06.073
You should get in a band, Barry.

30:06.240 --> 30:08.071
Put on lipstick,
dance around and all.

30:08.240 --> 30:10.196
- You'd be bleedin' great.
- Piss off.

30:13.480 --> 30:15.436
- What did you say?
- Nothin'.

30:20.760 --> 30:22.079
See yous, lads.

30:22.200 --> 30:23.599
See yous at the Oscars.

30:28.040 --> 30:30.270
Right, lads,
lots of energy in this.

30:30.400 --> 30:32.600
And, Ngig, I want to see you
really pressing those keys.

30:32.680 --> 30:35.035
Here's some playback.

30:56.760 --> 30:59.513
 She's standing
on the corner 

31:01.640 --> 31:03.676
 And as I look
a little closer 

31:06.800 --> 31:08.995
I'm a model.

31:17.320 --> 31:20.312
 She holds the key
to the missing code 

31:20.480 --> 31:22.436
 Just the thought
of her touch 

31:47.720 --> 31:49.995
 She's got a taste
for adventure 

32:04.160 --> 32:07.118
 She holds the key
to the missing code 

32:07.240 --> 32:09.071
 Just the thought
of her touch 

32:26.960 --> 32:28.951
Why don't we go eat these
in the park?

32:29.080 --> 32:30.115
There you go.

32:30.240 --> 32:31.753
- Thank you.
- No problem.

32:35.480 --> 32:37.152
Can I spin you home?

32:37.280 --> 32:39.714
I didn't know you had a car.

32:40.800 --> 32:42.028
So where d'you live?

32:42.160 --> 32:44.594
Not far from the school.
Harcourt Terrace.

32:44.720 --> 32:46.039
Ah, by the canal.

32:46.160 --> 32:47.434
Did you grow up there?

32:47.560 --> 32:49.391
Yeah. Though we're
probably moving.

32:49.520 --> 32:50.714
My parents are broke.

32:50.840 --> 32:52.432
That's why they sent me
to that school.

32:52.560 --> 32:53.959
Yeah, I was wondering
about that.

32:54.080 --> 32:55.911
You're a bit posh
for around there.

32:56.040 --> 32:58.031
Speak for yourself.
Your house is massive.

32:58.200 --> 32:59.872
Is it?

33:00.000 --> 33:01.592
My parents
are probably splitting up.

33:01.720 --> 33:03.312
That's sad.
Are you doing okay with it?

33:03.440 --> 33:04.759
Oh, yeah.

33:04.880 --> 33:06.296
It's a bit intense
being around them.

33:06.320 --> 33:08.595
Jesus, all that drama.

33:08.720 --> 33:10.631
I'm glad I don't have parents.

33:12.680 --> 33:14.955
Haven't we been down
this square already?

33:15.080 --> 33:17.036
Uh, no.

33:32.120 --> 33:34.918
You are the slowest cyclist
I have ever met.

33:35.040 --> 33:36.359
Okay.

33:36.480 --> 33:38.277
Thanks.

33:38.400 --> 33:40.550
- That was great fun.
- Yeah, it was really fun.

33:43.560 --> 33:46.074
Hey, baby!

33:46.200 --> 33:47.349
Hi.

33:47.480 --> 33:49.596
- This is Evan Adams.
- Word.

33:49.720 --> 33:51.160
- How do you do?
- This is the singer

33:51.200 --> 33:52.496
in the band
I was telling you about.

33:52.520 --> 33:54.158
Oh, yeah,
she played me your song.

33:54.280 --> 33:55.508
Good vibes.

33:55.640 --> 33:57.710
Little bit of Duran Duran
in there,

33:57.840 --> 33:59.273
bit of New Romance.

33:59.400 --> 34:00.720
What style would you say
you were?

34:00.800 --> 34:02.233
I'm a futurist.

34:02.360 --> 34:03.475
Epic.

34:03.640 --> 34:05.835
See you in the future, then.

34:08.199 --> 34:09.393
- Ready, baby?
- Yeah.

34:09.520 --> 34:10.600
- Okay.
- I'll see you soon.

34:10.679 --> 34:12.476
See you.

34:19.600 --> 34:21.476
Let's make
another video sometime.

34:21.600 --> 34:24.353
Nice blouse!

34:24.480 --> 34:26.357
Aw, shit.

34:53.520 --> 34:55.909
You have to imagine
it's not as...

34:56.040 --> 34:58.031
Shit?

34:58.160 --> 34:59.513
This will be good.

34:59.640 --> 35:01.312
- Really?
- Yeah.

35:01.440 --> 35:03.635
You just need some proper
cameras and a good director.

35:03.760 --> 35:05.840
But as long as it's in
your head, that's what counts.

35:05.920 --> 35:07.717
It's an exercise in imagination.

35:07.840 --> 35:10.559
Think big, Conor.
This is just a means to an end.

35:10.680 --> 35:12.033
And she looks amazing.

35:12.160 --> 35:13.832
She's got to be
in all the videos.

35:13.960 --> 35:14.836
- Yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

35:14.960 --> 35:16.518
She's world-class.

35:16.640 --> 35:18.616
Without her, you're just
a bunch of gay-looking kids

35:18.640 --> 35:19.755
down an alleyway.

35:19.880 --> 35:20.880
Have you kissed her yet?

35:21.000 --> 35:22.194
- No way.
- Why not?

35:22.320 --> 35:23.833
She's a year older than me.

35:23.960 --> 35:25.176
And, anyway,
she's got a boyfriend.

35:25.200 --> 35:27.668
- Ah. Who?
- Evan Adams.

35:27.800 --> 35:29.233
He's, like, a full-grown man.

35:29.360 --> 35:31.157
He's got a car and all
and stubble.

35:31.280 --> 35:33.236
What's he doing
hanging out with a kid?

35:33.400 --> 35:34.674
She's not really like a kid.

35:34.800 --> 35:37.030
Hmm.

35:37.160 --> 35:38.160
- What's this?
- Homework.

35:38.280 --> 35:39.759
You're good. Get better.

35:39.880 --> 35:41.677
How d'you know
he's her boyfriend anyway?

35:41.800 --> 35:43.153
It seemed like it.

35:43.280 --> 35:45.191
Pulled off in his car,
music blaring.

35:45.320 --> 35:46.320
He's pretty cool.

35:46.440 --> 35:47.714
What was he listening to?

35:47.840 --> 35:49.068
Genesis.

35:49.200 --> 35:50.349
He will not be a problem.

35:50.480 --> 35:52.232
- Really?
- Trust me.

35:52.360 --> 35:56.035
No woman can truly love a man
who listens to Phil Collins.

35:57.480 --> 35:58.833
Shh.

35:58.960 --> 36:00.393
Listen.

36:12.760 --> 36:14.318
I think she's having an affair.

36:14.480 --> 36:17.040
What? Why?

36:17.160 --> 36:19.520
She gets a lift home from her
boss a couple of times a week.

36:19.640 --> 36:21.358
She doesn't drive.
What's wrong with that?

36:21.480 --> 36:23.816
She gets out of the car about
100 yards away from the house.

36:23.840 --> 36:25.796
It's a nervous thing.

36:28.280 --> 36:31.078
She's overcompensating.

36:46.080 --> 36:47.513
Good night, then.

37:03.960 --> 37:05.552
Hey, Conor, what's going on?

37:05.680 --> 37:06.680
I don't know.

37:06.760 --> 37:07.954
What are you doing?

37:08.120 --> 37:09.951
Just, just rabbit stuff.

37:11.120 --> 37:12.553
D'you want to write a new song?

37:12.680 --> 37:14.750
Yes, I do.

37:14.880 --> 37:16.074
Records.

37:16.200 --> 37:17.952
Really good records.

37:19.440 --> 37:22.398
My brother loves this.

37:22.520 --> 37:24.988
He says it's homework.

37:27.080 --> 37:28.513
You see how bass guitar

37:28.680 --> 37:30.520
and the bass pedal
are playing the same rhythm?

37:30.600 --> 37:31.953
You'll hear it now, wait.

37:32.080 --> 37:33.832
I told all of yous,
you especially,

37:33.960 --> 37:35.678
shitting on the bed
all the time.

37:35.800 --> 37:37.279
You can't put rabbits on the bed

37:37.440 --> 37:39.000
and not expect them
to shit on your bed.

37:39.080 --> 37:40.513
A chord like...

37:40.640 --> 37:41.709
Yeah.

37:43.280 --> 37:44.315
Somewhere in the...

37:46.120 --> 37:48.554
So...

37:48.680 --> 37:51.478
 Up to the stars
she shows me 

37:51.600 --> 37:53.477
 Dame Street,
George's Street 

37:55.600 --> 37:57.511
- That's good. I like that.
- Yeah.

37:57.640 --> 37:59.119
I love that middle A.

37:59.240 --> 38:00.992
Yeah, go get the guitar;
let's try it out.

38:01.120 --> 38:02.600
It-it'll sound better
on the acoustic.

38:05.480 --> 38:07.391
It's gonna sound great
with the lads.

38:16.920 --> 38:20.595
 It's 2:00
on the edge of the morning 

38:20.720 --> 38:24.474
 She's running magical circles
around my head 

38:24.600 --> 38:28.354
 I hitch a ride on a dream
she's driving 

38:28.480 --> 38:32.314
 She turns to kiss me,
I crash back into bed 

38:32.440 --> 38:36.194
 Across the street
on a grayed out Monday 

38:36.320 --> 38:40.313
 I see the girl with the eyes
I can't describe 

38:40.440 --> 38:43.989
 And suddenly
it's a perfect Sunday 

38:44.120 --> 38:47.874
 And everything
is more real than life 

38:48.000 --> 38:51.834
 I think
I'm back in the dream 

38:51.960 --> 38:55.714
 I think I'm back
on the ceiling 

38:55.840 --> 38:58.479
 It's such
a beautiful feeling 

39:15.400 --> 39:19.234
 You find a mystery
bound in perfection 

39:19.360 --> 39:23.148
 You've got to read, but
you don't wanna reach the end 

39:23.280 --> 39:27.034
 'Cause what if everything
beautiful's fiction 

39:27.160 --> 39:30.948
 And this reality's
just pretend? 

39:31.080 --> 39:35.119
 And then
I'm back in the dream 

39:38.880 --> 39:41.235
 It's such
a beautiful feeling 

39:58.640 --> 40:01.791
 Up to the stars
she shows me 

40:01.960 --> 40:03.712
 Dame Street,
George's Street 

40:06.720 --> 40:10.633
 Up where the world
won't let us down 

40:48.040 --> 40:50.395
Boys, look at David Bowie.

40:52.440 --> 40:54.317
Oh, I like this.

40:54.440 --> 40:55.555
- What is it?
- My band.

40:55.720 --> 40:57.312
- You're in a band? Cool.
- Yeah.

40:57.440 --> 40:58.440
What are they called?

40:58.600 --> 41:00.192
Sing Street.

41:00.320 --> 41:01.719
Who's this now?
Your girlfriend?

41:01.840 --> 41:02.716
Yeah.

41:02.840 --> 41:04.671
No.

41:04.800 --> 41:06.438
She's a friend of mine.

41:06.560 --> 41:08.232
- She's a model.
- Hmm.

41:08.400 --> 41:09.753
But she's got a boyfriend.

41:09.880 --> 41:10.995
An older guy.

41:11.120 --> 41:12.872
Ah.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.673
All the complicated boys
and girls.

41:17.320 --> 41:19.276
Good work.

41:19.400 --> 41:22.551
Brother Baxter would like
to see, uh, Conor Lawlor.

41:22.680 --> 41:24.113
Okay. Conor.

41:25.800 --> 41:27.199
Conor Lawlor.

41:27.320 --> 41:28.320
What's going on?

41:28.400 --> 41:29.628
With what?

41:29.760 --> 41:30.875
This.

41:31.000 --> 41:32.672
Oh, well.

41:32.840 --> 41:34.432
I checked the rule book...

41:34.560 --> 41:36.176
the-the one you mentioned
about brown shoes...

41:36.200 --> 41:37.952
and I couldn't find anything
about makeup

41:38.080 --> 41:39.274
or altering hair color.

41:39.400 --> 41:41.356
Oh, and look.

41:41.480 --> 41:45.109
I painted these
with paint from the art room.

41:45.240 --> 41:46.468
Head down to the toilet

41:46.600 --> 41:47.880
and remove the makeup right now.

41:47.960 --> 41:50.110
- Why?
- Because I told you to.

41:50.240 --> 41:51.514
But I'm in a band.

41:51.640 --> 41:53.153
It's a school band,

41:53.320 --> 41:55.096
and I think it's important
that we have a look.

41:55.120 --> 41:56.872
You're a man.
Men don't wear makeup.

41:57.000 --> 41:58.399
But why not?

41:58.520 --> 42:00.636
People in the 18th century
wore makeup.

42:00.760 --> 42:02.557
That means people
like Mozart wore makeup,

42:02.680 --> 42:03.715
and he was a man.

42:03.840 --> 42:06.229
So you're Mozart now, are you?

42:08.160 --> 42:11.470
That makes me Salieri, is it?

42:11.600 --> 42:12.953
Who's Salieri?

42:13.080 --> 42:15.389
You've a fine face.

42:15.520 --> 42:18.671
Pretty enough without makeup.

42:18.800 --> 42:20.631
Take it off.

42:20.760 --> 42:23.069
You can use my bathroom,
if you like.

42:26.840 --> 42:28.432
Come on in here.

42:29.720 --> 42:31.631
I'm gonna go to class now.

42:43.520 --> 42:44.669
Jesus!

42:46.440 --> 42:47.555
You can't do this!

42:47.680 --> 42:49.477
Do you want to bet?

42:53.520 --> 42:55.158
I'll get you clean, don't worry.

42:55.280 --> 42:56.633
Clean you all up.

42:56.800 --> 42:59.030
Get all that shite off you.

42:59.160 --> 43:02.709
Take pride
in your God-given features.

43:12.200 --> 43:15.158
No more Ziggy Stardust.

43:46.720 --> 43:49.029
- Hey, Cosmo.
- Who?

43:49.160 --> 43:51.720
Cosmo. That's what
I'm calling you now.

43:51.840 --> 43:54.513
You're gonna need a catchy name
if you're gonna be in a band.

43:54.640 --> 43:55.709
Right.

43:55.840 --> 43:57.319
What happened?

43:57.440 --> 43:58.714
Nothing.

43:58.840 --> 44:00.114
Come on.

44:03.560 --> 44:05.152
I really liked your song.

44:05.280 --> 44:06.838
It made me cry.

44:06.960 --> 44:07.836
Oh.

44:07.960 --> 44:09.837
I'm really sorry.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.514
No, that's a good thing.

44:15.480 --> 44:17.436
So who's the guy with the car?

44:17.560 --> 44:18.879
Evan?

44:19.000 --> 44:20.433
Yeah.

44:20.560 --> 44:23.199
Is he your boyfriend?

44:23.320 --> 44:24.878
We're on and off.

44:25.000 --> 44:26.831
It's complicated.

44:26.960 --> 44:29.315
We're actually on
a little break at the moment.

44:29.440 --> 44:31.078
Yeah.

44:31.200 --> 44:32.872
Good idea.

44:33.000 --> 44:34.797
Take a break for a year or so.

44:34.920 --> 44:37.559
Get some perspective.

44:37.680 --> 44:40.956
He's actually a really nice guy.

44:41.080 --> 44:42.593
Yeah.

44:42.720 --> 44:44.995
Shit taste in music, though.

44:46.960 --> 44:48.837
We're going to London soon.

44:48.960 --> 44:51.474
I'm too young to go on my own,
so he's organized everything.

44:51.600 --> 44:55.070
What's in it for Evan?

44:55.200 --> 44:56.553
Are you jealous, Cosmo?

44:56.680 --> 44:57.954
Why would I be jealous?

44:58.080 --> 44:59.399
Exactly.

45:03.080 --> 45:05.310
Will you write me
a happy song sometime?

45:05.440 --> 45:06.714
I need a laugh.

45:06.840 --> 45:08.193
But what if I don't feel happy?

45:08.320 --> 45:13.110
Your problem is that you're
not happy being sad.

45:13.240 --> 45:16.038
But that's what love is, Cosmo.

45:16.160 --> 45:17.718
Happy-sad.

45:24.400 --> 45:26.072
Shit, I've got to go soon.

45:26.240 --> 45:29.789
We only have a half hour
dinner window in our house.

45:29.920 --> 45:31.911
So, what's the house like,
where you live?

45:32.080 --> 45:33.479
It's nice.

45:33.600 --> 45:36.478
Nicer than some of the dumps
I've lived in.

45:36.600 --> 45:39.717
So where are your parents?

45:39.880 --> 45:40.949
My dad's brown bread.

45:41.080 --> 45:43.355
He got hit by a car.

45:43.480 --> 45:45.550
Oh, my God. Sorry.

45:45.720 --> 45:47.676
Really don't be.

45:47.800 --> 45:49.597
He was a drunk.
He deserved it.

45:49.720 --> 45:52.598
And me ma's in and out
of hospital.

45:52.720 --> 45:54.119
Why?

45:54.240 --> 45:55.514
She's a nurse.

45:55.640 --> 45:57.153
Oh, right.

45:57.280 --> 45:59.589
No, she's manic-depressive.

46:02.200 --> 46:04.156
So, like, happy-sad.

46:07.120 --> 46:09.714
You're funny, I like that.

46:09.840 --> 46:11.592
Well, let me know if you need me

46:11.720 --> 46:14.439
for any more videos before I go.

46:21.120 --> 46:23.634
When are you going?

46:23.800 --> 46:25.392
Soon.

46:33.720 --> 46:35.597
What did she mean by that?

46:35.720 --> 46:37.312
Well, I think
what she means is that

46:37.480 --> 46:39.198
you need to reach
a place in your life

46:39.320 --> 46:40.833
where you're okay
with your sadness.

46:40.960 --> 46:42.234
It's pretty high concept stuff.

46:42.400 --> 46:43.680
How old d'you say she was again?

46:43.760 --> 46:44.760
Sixteen.

46:44.800 --> 46:46.119
It's monastic.

46:46.280 --> 46:47.280
She's like a monk.

46:47.400 --> 46:49.470
She sounds really pretentious.

46:49.600 --> 46:52.040
Why, 'cause she wants to leave
school and follow her vocation?

46:52.200 --> 46:54.760
You call wanting
to be a model a vocation?

46:54.880 --> 46:56.552
Anything can be a vocation, Ann.

46:56.680 --> 46:59.797
Being a taxi driver,
being a bin man, being a poet,

46:59.960 --> 47:02.030
being a singer, being an artist.

47:02.160 --> 47:04.435
Brendan, I never wanted
to be an artist.

47:04.560 --> 47:05.576
We couldn't get the brush
out of your hand

47:05.600 --> 47:06.476
when you were a kid.

47:06.600 --> 47:08.830
What is wrong
with being an architect?

47:08.960 --> 47:10.188
It's not a vocation.

47:10.320 --> 47:12.629
I thought
everything was a vocation.

47:12.760 --> 47:14.478
Don't be playing
word games with me, Ann.

47:14.640 --> 47:17.029
I don't do "words," all right?

47:17.160 --> 47:19.355
Come on, Conor.

47:19.520 --> 47:22.557
Turn out the lights
before you go to bed, Ann.

47:24.600 --> 47:27.398
So her dad's dead
and her mam is a lunatic.

47:27.520 --> 47:28.873
And you thought
you had problems.

47:29.000 --> 47:32.470
I see now what the older
boyfriend thing is about.

47:32.600 --> 47:34.477
Daddy issues.

47:34.600 --> 47:36.113
I used to know chicks like this.

47:36.240 --> 47:38.390
They're tricky, and they need
a lot of protecting.

47:38.520 --> 47:39.748
Are you up to that, Conor?

47:39.880 --> 47:42.155
I don't know.

47:42.280 --> 47:44.191
So what's it all about?

47:44.320 --> 47:47.551
I think she's just
an amazing human being.

47:47.680 --> 47:50.797
I've never seen anyone like her.

47:50.920 --> 47:53.275
The way she talks and looks.

47:53.400 --> 47:54.776
She wears these sunglasses,

47:54.800 --> 47:58.429
and when she takes them off,
her eyes

47:58.600 --> 48:00.280
are like the clouds
clearing past the moon.

48:01.800 --> 48:03.631
Sometimes I just
want to cry looking at her.

48:08.360 --> 48:11.113
They're happy-sad.

48:27.960 --> 48:30.997
So how do you mean
you're "happy-sad"?

48:31.120 --> 48:32.997
Yeah, how am I supposed
to market that?

48:33.120 --> 48:34.678
It means we're not pop anymore.

48:34.800 --> 48:36.119
We were pop?

48:36.240 --> 48:37.496
Listen,
I'm happy being anything.

48:37.520 --> 48:38.953
I just want to play music.

48:39.080 --> 48:40.080
That's fine.

48:40.200 --> 48:41.200
Be who you are, Eamon.

48:41.320 --> 48:42.958
Well, I don't know who I am.

48:43.080 --> 48:44.308
Maybe I'm happy-sad, too.

48:44.480 --> 48:45.833
I don't know.

48:45.960 --> 48:47.359
What does happy-sad even mean?

48:47.480 --> 48:49.357
How can we be both things?
It makes no sense.

48:49.480 --> 48:51.118
It means that I'm stuck
in this shithole

48:51.280 --> 48:53.874
full of morons and rapists
and bullies,

48:54.000 --> 48:55.797
and I'm gonna deal with it,
okay?

48:55.920 --> 48:58.150
It's just how life is.

48:58.280 --> 49:01.590
I'm gonna try and accept it
and get on with it

49:01.720 --> 49:03.950
and make some art.

49:04.080 --> 49:05.433
So how does that
affect our music?

49:05.560 --> 49:07.437
- Positively.
- All right.

49:37.240 --> 49:38.753
Okay.

49:38.880 --> 49:40.836
So the idea of this video
is about a guy

49:40.960 --> 49:42.188
standing halfway down a pier,

49:42.320 --> 49:43.912
and a beautiful woman
walks past him

49:44.080 --> 49:45.479
towards the lighthouse.

49:45.600 --> 49:48.956
Half an hour later,
she hasn't come back.

49:49.080 --> 49:51.719
So he investigates,
but she's gone.

49:51.880 --> 49:52.880
What?

49:53.000 --> 49:53.876
She killed herself.

49:54.000 --> 49:55.194
No, she's a mermaid,

49:55.320 --> 49:56.799
and she's jumped
back into the sea.

49:56.920 --> 49:58.600
You see, she got washed up
in a fishing net

49:58.680 --> 50:00.520
so she's been in the city,
and she's been dying

50:00.600 --> 50:02.830
to get back to the water,
to her friends.

50:02.960 --> 50:04.109
Back to where she belongs.

50:04.240 --> 50:05.832
That's much better.

50:05.960 --> 50:08.599
I know.

50:08.720 --> 50:11.553
Okay, so we're playing here
and Raphina walks by.

50:11.680 --> 50:13.591
- So where do I jump from?
- Here.

50:13.720 --> 50:16.234
- Aah!
- Yeah.

50:16.360 --> 50:17.873
How'd that look, lads?

50:18.000 --> 50:19.069
Yeah, it looked all right.

50:19.240 --> 50:20.355
It's a bit shit.

50:20.480 --> 50:21.833
That supposed to look like

50:21.960 --> 50:23.279
they're jumping in or something?

50:23.400 --> 50:24.549
Yeah.

50:24.680 --> 50:26.033
It doesn't.

50:27.360 --> 50:30.079
Trust me. It'll work.

50:41.720 --> 50:44.996
 Fake deals
in the supermarket 

50:45.120 --> 50:48.430
 TVs selling
what you can't get 

50:48.560 --> 50:52.633
 She laughs, "Nowhere is
as pretty as this" 

50:55.760 --> 50:58.797
 Gray cars
crawlin' in the slow lane 

50:58.920 --> 51:02.196
 Lost stars
waiting for the DART train 

51:02.320 --> 51:06.518
 She smiles, turns and blows
the city a kiss 

51:16.200 --> 51:17.633
Shit.

51:17.800 --> 51:19.616
What the hell, Raphina?

51:19.640 --> 51:21.835
Keep bloody filming!
Save me!

51:21.960 --> 51:23.313
I can't swim!

51:29.080 --> 51:31.469
 This girl
is a beautiful sea 

51:35.680 --> 51:36.856
 The girl is
a beautiful sea. 

51:36.880 --> 51:38.560
- What were you thinking?
- Did you get it?

51:38.680 --> 51:39.556
Yeah, it was great!

51:39.680 --> 51:41.636
Ah! Fantastic!

51:41.760 --> 51:42.795
Can you really not swim?

51:42.920 --> 51:44.319
No.

51:44.440 --> 51:45.759
So why'd you do that, then?

51:45.880 --> 51:48.838
For our art, Cosmo.

51:49.000 --> 51:51.275
You can never
do anything by half.

51:51.400 --> 51:52.992
Do you understand that?

52:04.080 --> 52:05.957
I'm... I'm sorry.

52:06.080 --> 52:07.559
Look, I was...

52:07.680 --> 52:09.238
Great is what it was.

52:09.360 --> 52:11.396
Fair play.

52:12.520 --> 52:15.159
What about Evan?

52:16.200 --> 52:17.633
Yeah, you ruined it.

52:30.920 --> 52:32.956
You know, on a clear day,

52:33.080 --> 52:34.696
you can actually see
the mainland of Britain.

52:34.720 --> 52:37.553
Island's only 30 miles
from the coast of Wales.

52:37.680 --> 52:40.478
Bet you didn't know that.

52:40.600 --> 52:43.910
It has to have just rained,
no dust in the air.

52:44.040 --> 52:47.191
You can just about see it.

52:47.320 --> 52:48.639
No way.

52:48.760 --> 52:50.113
How do you know stuff like that?

52:50.240 --> 52:52.629
My granddad worked
on the ships to Holyhead.

52:52.760 --> 52:54.955
He used to take me out here.

52:55.080 --> 52:58.834
We used to go out
in his little boat, fishing.

52:58.960 --> 53:01.030
Wow.

53:01.160 --> 53:04.118
So I can wave back to you
when I'm in London.

53:12.560 --> 53:14.437
My brother says
all the great artists

53:14.560 --> 53:16.915
had to get off this island.

53:17.040 --> 53:18.519
The ones who stayed
got depressed

53:18.640 --> 53:20.710
and turned into alcoholics.

53:20.880 --> 53:23.519
Makes sense.

53:23.640 --> 53:25.551
You talk about
your brother a lot.

53:25.720 --> 53:29.076
Do you really love him?

53:29.200 --> 53:31.191
He was gonna go to Germany
when he was younger.

53:31.320 --> 53:33.197
But my parents
would never let him go

53:33.320 --> 53:35.436
without finishing school.

53:37.840 --> 53:40.115
He was gonna run away;
he had the whole thing planned,

53:40.240 --> 53:41.355
so he says.

53:41.480 --> 53:42.595
So what happened?

53:42.720 --> 53:44.472
My mum found out.

53:44.600 --> 53:45.600
She closed it down.

53:45.720 --> 53:48.154
She didn't want him to go.

53:48.280 --> 53:50.794
Maybe she loved him too much.

53:50.920 --> 53:52.433
Yeah.

53:52.560 --> 53:54.118
Actually, I think you're right.

53:55.640 --> 53:57.835
That's what my dad
always used to say.

53:58.000 --> 54:00.309
When my ma would be
in hospital, in a spell,

54:00.440 --> 54:02.271
and it was just the two of us.

54:02.400 --> 54:04.440
So I'd get all dressed up
to go out with my friends,

54:04.560 --> 54:06.118
then he'd make me stay in.

54:06.240 --> 54:07.593
And afterwards, he'd say,

54:07.760 --> 54:09.876
"I love you too much,
is all."

54:12.120 --> 54:14.176
And the thing is, me ma's
much better-looking than I am,

54:14.200 --> 54:17.158
so I don't really know
why he'd bother with me.

54:22.800 --> 54:25.758
It's a strange
kind of love, isn't it?

54:25.880 --> 54:28.110
Parents.

54:32.800 --> 54:34.358
I would've saved her.

54:34.480 --> 54:36.072
And I could've.

54:36.200 --> 54:37.696
- No, you couldn't have.
- I could've.

54:37.720 --> 54:40.314
- You're too small.
- I'm not too small.

54:40.440 --> 54:41.560
You're way too small.

54:41.640 --> 54:42.868
I've a good joke for you guys.

54:43.000 --> 54:45.434
Vagina. Do you get it?

54:45.560 --> 54:46.959
- No.
- Exactly.

54:48.840 --> 54:51.434
All right, uh...

54:51.560 --> 54:53.198
why did the pink...

55:04.720 --> 55:06.199
Look at her.

55:06.360 --> 55:08.476
She races home every evening

55:08.600 --> 55:10.670
just to catch that
last little bit of sun...

55:13.120 --> 55:15.475
have a cigarette
and read her papers.

55:15.600 --> 55:19.070
She's always talking about
going on a holiday to Spain.

55:19.200 --> 55:22.749
But he never takes her.

55:22.920 --> 55:25.593
That's all she gets.

55:25.720 --> 55:29.110
Then that tall tree blocks it,
and she comes in.

55:38.280 --> 55:40.475
I often wonder
what she's thinking about.

55:53.240 --> 55:54.798
That's amazing.

56:16.200 --> 56:17.760
Ah, how's the band
getting along?

56:17.840 --> 56:18.920
What are they called again?

56:19.000 --> 56:20.149
"The Queers"?

56:20.280 --> 56:21.616
Good one, Barry.

56:21.640 --> 56:23.790
Is, uh, anyone
getting these down?

56:23.920 --> 56:25.478
You know who you're
a bit like, Barry?

56:25.600 --> 56:26.919
Uh, Oscar Wilde.

56:27.040 --> 56:28.336
What class is he in, then?

56:28.360 --> 56:30.316
He's not in school,
Barry, you spanner.

56:32.080 --> 56:33.920
You know I am gonna kill you
one of these days.

56:35.400 --> 56:36.913
No, you're not.

56:37.080 --> 56:39.355
- 'Cause you don't even exist.
- What?

56:39.480 --> 56:40.696
Maybe you're living in my world;

56:40.720 --> 56:42.676
I'm not living in yours.

56:42.800 --> 56:44.950
You're just material
for my songs.

56:45.080 --> 56:47.310
Man, I'd be very careful about
what you say to me next.

56:47.440 --> 56:48.509
Floor him, Barry.

56:48.640 --> 56:50.240
I don't want to have
to batter you again.

56:51.040 --> 56:52.234
Go ahead, Barry.

56:54.240 --> 56:56.959
Go on.

57:01.080 --> 57:03.036
You only have the power
to stop things.

57:06.160 --> 57:07.752
But not to create.

57:17.320 --> 57:19.151
"End of term disco
at the school hall.

57:19.280 --> 57:20.952
DJ and lights." So?

57:21.120 --> 57:23.554
I say we ask if we can
play there. First gig.

57:23.680 --> 57:25.238
- We're not ready.
- We could be.

57:25.360 --> 57:27.510
We need a deadline,
something to prepare for.

57:27.640 --> 57:29.870
We have exams.
We need to prepare for them.

57:30.000 --> 57:32.120
Yeah, they're midterm exams.
They don't mean anything.

57:32.160 --> 57:34.913
Yeah, well, they do to my ma.
She wants me to go to college.

57:35.040 --> 57:37.349
Get qualifications and all.

57:37.480 --> 57:38.879
Will there be girls
at the disco?

57:39.000 --> 57:40.115
Yes.

57:40.240 --> 57:41.878
I say we do it.

57:42.000 --> 57:43.399
We have five songs.

57:43.560 --> 57:46.233
We'd need a half-hour set,
so three more.

57:51.760 --> 57:54.513
 And tell me
not to wear brown shoes 

58:00.360 --> 58:02.430
Come on, where are you going?

58:02.560 --> 58:03.913
It's half-9:00 at night.

58:04.080 --> 58:05.096
Why are you acting,
all of a sudden,

58:05.120 --> 58:06.296
- as if it matters?
- Come on,

58:06.320 --> 58:07.456
- this is bullshit.
- As if you care?

58:07.480 --> 58:08.496
You're gonna go down the street.

58:08.520 --> 58:09.856
You're gonna be back
in ten minutes.

58:09.880 --> 58:11.656
- Not this time.
- That's what you always say.

58:11.680 --> 58:13.318
It is not what I always say!

58:13.440 --> 58:14.856
It's 9:00 at night!
It's dark!

58:14.880 --> 58:16.056
I've got somewhere to go to.

58:16.080 --> 58:17.400
You're not taking the car.

58:17.480 --> 58:18.896
I suppose Mr. What's-His-Name
will come around in his.

58:18.920 --> 58:20.776
- His name's Tony.
- Tony can come around with his.

58:20.800 --> 58:22.313
Look here,
what about this dress?

58:22.440 --> 58:23.616
This dress is lovely.
Do you want to take that one?

58:23.640 --> 58:24.516
Don't touch my things!

58:24.640 --> 58:25.896
You'd look pretty sexy
in that one.

58:25.920 --> 58:27.148
When was the last time

58:27.280 --> 58:28.616
you noticed anything I wore,
any way that I looked?

58:28.640 --> 58:29.696
That's a pretty
sexy one, isn't it?

58:29.720 --> 58:30.776
He'll love that one, won't he?

58:30.800 --> 58:32.376
What about knickers?
Have you got knickers?

58:32.400 --> 58:33.496
You probably don't... you don't
need any knickers, do you?

58:33.520 --> 58:34.520
Just put them away!

58:38.640 --> 58:39.914
This is life, Conor.

58:40.040 --> 58:41.359
Drive it like you stole it.

58:58.000 --> 58:59.513
Come on!

58:59.680 --> 59:00.829
No!

59:02.280 --> 59:03.920
- Come on, get her up.
- Let's get her up!

59:05.280 --> 59:07.316
What do you think you're doing?

59:21.800 --> 59:23.313
That's great!

59:29.000 --> 59:31.116
Try a bit of hi-hat, Larry.

59:32.680 --> 59:34.477
 You just
can't stand the way 

59:34.600 --> 59:38.070
 That I walked out
from the wreckage 

59:38.200 --> 59:43.433
 Can't understand the way
that I turned myself around 

59:43.600 --> 59:47.513
 I tried to terminate
this war 

59:51.560 --> 59:55.109
 You keep
coming back for more... 

59:55.240 --> 59:57.117
And begin.

01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:11.717
What does this even mean?

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.070
Suck my balls.

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:21.430
- Quiet!
- Night now.

01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:47.315
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:49.795
Do you want to go
on an adventure?

01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:53.796
Oh. Okay.

01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:05.511
Do you see the pole there,
the yellow one?

01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:07.033
Yeah.

01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:09.116
That's where we're heading.

01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:13.276
If my parents found out
I took this out,

01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:14.549
they'd kill me.

01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:16.079
Have you taken it out before?

01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:17.349
Every few weeks.

01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:20.096
A boat's like
a musical instrument...

01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:21.838
it doesn't like it
if you don't use it.

01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:24.394
That's what
my granddad said, you know,

01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:26.670
so I like to
look after it for him.

01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:28.480
Look, there's the ferry
heading to England.

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:32.358
Full of lrish people.

01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:45.316
Okay, so go.

01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:46.793
"You just can't stand the way

01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:48.400
that we walked out
from the wreckage."

01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:50.078
What wreckage?

01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:51.394
Maybe the wreckage of family.

01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:52.840
That's what I was
thinking about.

01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:56.075
Okay, next.

01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:59.909
"You just can't stand the way
that I turned my life around."

01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:02.554
That's about you.

01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:04.716
What do you mean?

01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:07.149
Well, I was thinking
about my parents

01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:09.350
and how I thought
I had problems.

01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:11.471
And the way you've turned
your life around.

01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:13.431
How have I turned
my life around?

01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:14.754
Well, look at you.

01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:16.154
You're going to a new country.

01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:17.156
You've got a vocation.

01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:18.679
You look amazing.

01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:19.676
Stop.

01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:20.800
Stop what?

01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:22.353
Just get on with the song.

01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:24.072
What's the video gonna be about?

01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:26.998
So... I think it's set
at a school prom,

01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:28.997
like in an American high school.

01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:31.315
I've always wanted to go
to an American school.

01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:33.431
With girls and hair gel.

01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:36.160
Have you seen
"Back to the Future"?

01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:38.037
I see all the films.

01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:41.118
Imagine the band, all in suits.

01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:43.470
I have all the shots
planned in my head.

01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:45.272
My brother told me to think big.

01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:47.755
And what if I come
in a big '50s dress?

01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:49.313
Yeah.

01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:52.591
And the whole crowd parts
and everyone disappears.

01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:56.156
And then we all break out
into this big dance routine,

01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:58.236
and everyone is there.

01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:02.276
And then you and I
just run off into the night

01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:05.358
with the twinkling lights
of the city behind us.

01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:10.478
You were a bit attractive
back there.

01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:12.756
Back where?

01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:15.519
On the boat.

01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:17.119
Thank you.

01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:19.356
Just a little bit.

01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:21.909
Bit like a captain.

01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:24.349
I like that.

01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:26.675
Aye-aye.

01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:28.995
You're always very attractive.

01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:30.838
I know.

01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:32.995
And very conceited.

01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:34.513
Just stop talking.

01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:35.709
For once.

01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:03.515
I've just...

01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:05.669
Sorry.

01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:11.479
- Now, is it...?
- Oh, yeah.

01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:12.600
Yeah.

01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:25.916
So when are
we shooting this video?

01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:27.712
Saturday next.

01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:30.193
Oh.

01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:41.556
Conor?

01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:51.837
Good. You're up.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:57.197
If this is about
my exam results...

01:04:57.320 --> 01:04:58.719
I can explain, see...

01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:00.717
It's not about
your exams, Conor.

01:05:00.840 --> 01:05:03.229
We need to talk
to all of you. Sit down.

01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:07.593
Well, so, firstly,

01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:09.816
we don't want to make a big
deal about this, you know.

01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:11.096
It's something we've
thought about a lot.

01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:12.136
A lot of married couples...

01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:13.832
Your father and I
are splitting up.

01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:15.393
Thank you. That's great.

01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:17.238
It was just a matter of time.

01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:18.634
I'll go get the bags packed.

01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:20.159
Let me know when
we're ready to go.

01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:22.080
Why don't you sit down,
Brendan, for a second?

01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:23.673
We'll tell you
what we're thinking.

01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:26.189
You see if you agree.

01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:29.198
A consensus?

01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:31.316
That's novel. Okay.

01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:36.753
Your mother has
fallen in love with Tony.

01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:39.348
They're gonna be moving into
his apartment for awhile and...

01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:40.480
Yeah.

01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:42.312
We've had an offer
on this house.

01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:45.113
It's half what it's worth,
but we're gonna take it.

01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:47.151
I can't afford
to live here on my own.

01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:49.635
So you're getting a divorce?

01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:51.200
Can't get divorced in lreland,

01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:53.356
so we'll be legally separated.

01:05:53.480 --> 01:05:54.800
I'm gonna be
getting an apartment,

01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:58.037
and you three will live
between there and...

01:05:58.160 --> 01:05:59.513
there.

01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:01.910
I'm not gonna be
staying at Tony's.

01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:04.793
Let's get that crystal clear.

01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:07.434
I'd rather sleep on the street.

01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:11.599
I understand this is upsetting
for you, Brendan.

01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:13.438
You don't understand anything!

01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:15.994
For all of you.

01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:19.676
This is bullshit.

01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:22.593
So you were right.

01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:24.760
They're just
human beings. I told you that.

01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:26.233
I was sort of hoping they'd come

01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:28.078
to my gig
at the end of the month.

01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:30.280
What, you thought they'd just
become different people

01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:32.590
and start noticing
what you were doing

01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:34.153
and what you wanted?

01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:35.680
They've got
their own shit going on.

01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:37.136
They're not going
to your stupid gig.

01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:38.513
So why is it stupid now?

01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:40.480
It's not that it's stupid,
it's just annoying.

01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:41.640
What's wrong with you?

01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:42.960
I don't know.
I'm in withdrawal!

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.638
- From what?
- I haven't smoked hash

01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:46.557
- in two days, Conor.
- Why?

01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:48.591
So I can do something
with my life.

01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:50.312
Like what?

01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:02.632
Do you see that guitar?

01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:05.228
I used to be able
to play that guitar... well.

01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:07.032
I used to ride hot girls.

01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:10.232
I could run 200 meters faster
than anybody in my school.

01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:11.918
You're the youngest.

01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:14.952
You get to follow the path
that I macheted

01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:17.355
through the jungle
that is our mad family.

01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:20.040
I was alone with them
for six years.

01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:21.513
You think they're crazy now?

01:07:21.680 --> 01:07:22.816
Think about what they were like

01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:24.319
when they were
in their late 20s.

01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:27.193
Two Catholics in a rented flat
with a screaming baby,

01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:29.595
who just got married because
they wanted to have sex.

01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:31.836
They didn't even
love each other.

01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:34.235
I was in the middle
of that, alone.

01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:35.515
And then you came along.

01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:37.471
Thank God!

01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:39.556
And you followed...

01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:41.989
the path that I cut for us.

01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:43.957
Untouched.

01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:46.714
You just moved in my jet stream.

01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:48.193
And people laugh at me, Conor.

01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:51.392
The stoner, the college dropout.

01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:53.192
And they praise you,
which is fine!

01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:55.117
But once...

01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:57.629
I was a fucking jet engine!

01:08:29.359 --> 01:08:31.350
Back in a second.

01:08:31.479 --> 01:08:33.277
Need to go to the bathroom.

01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:00.153
Ngig.

01:09:00.319 --> 01:09:01.752
Can you move that mic stand over

01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:03.656
- a bit more, all right?
- Are you expecting her soon?

01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:04.908
I thought she was coming,

01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:06.598
but I don't know where she is.

01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:08.136
Right, so you better
get something filmed.

01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:09.274
Yous have an hour.

01:09:09.399 --> 01:09:10.276
Come on, Conor.

01:09:10.399 --> 01:09:11.719
She's not coming.

01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:12.955
Let's just do whatever.

01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:14.832
Okay.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.638
Come over, guys.

01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:20.636
Okay, so this is like
a school video,

01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:22.392
except not like an lrish school,

01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:25.080
more like an American school,
and it's prom night.

01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:27.031
Have you seen
"Back to the Future"?

01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:31.716
Okay, well, it's just kind of
like '50s dancing, and...

01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:33.273
Like what?

01:09:33.399 --> 01:09:36.278
It's... like dancing
from the '50s, you know,

01:09:36.439 --> 01:09:38.240
clicking fingers and...

01:09:38.279 --> 01:09:39.792
Can we try some now, actually?
Just...

01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:42.194
Yeah. Yeah.

01:09:42.359 --> 01:09:43.587
That's it. Yeah.

01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:45.200
Yeah, maybe do
a few twirls and stuff.

01:09:45.319 --> 01:09:46.548
Just do what's natural.

01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:48.238
Make it as natural as possible.

01:09:48.359 --> 01:09:49.917
Let's get some playback.

01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:14.117
 You just
can't stand the way 

01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:17.277
 That I walked out
from the wreckage 

01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:27.473
 I tried to terminate
this war 

01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:34.869
 You keep coming back
for more 

01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:40.632
 I'm outta here,
no turnin' back 

01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:55.348
 You gotta grab the wheel
and own it 

01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:58.273
 And drive it
like you stole it 

01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:07.273
 You gotta learn
to rock and roll it 

01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:08.992
 You gotta put
the pedal down 

01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:11.680
 And drive it
like you stole it 

01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:17.474
 And drive it
like you stole it 

01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:28.475
 And we can't see
where we're goin' 

01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:33.832
 And the friction
slows us down 

01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:39.508
 For the world
to win me gold 

01:11:39.640 --> 01:11:41.995
 I'll leave
your dust behind me 

01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:05.600
 You gotta grab the wheel
and own it 

01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:09.269
 You gotta
put the pedal down 

01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:11.516
 And drive it
like you stole it 

01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:34.598
 You gotta grab the wheel
and own it 

01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:36.597
 And drive it
like you stole it 

01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:39.359
 Roll it,
this is your life 

01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:45.190
 You gotta learn
to rock and roll it 

01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:48.676
 You gotta put
the pedal down 

01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:51.593
 And drive it
like you stole it 

01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:57.034
 And drive it
like you stole it 

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.753
 And drive it
like you stole it 

01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:07.796
 And drive it
like you stole it 

01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:29.109
Um...

01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:30.798
All right, let's shoot it.

01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:46.153
- Oh.
- Yeah?

01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:48.271
Hi. Is Raphina there?

01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:49.953
No.
She doesn't live here anymore.

01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:54.155
- Wh-Where is she?
- I don't know.

01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:56.550
Are you the bloke in the band?

01:13:56.680 --> 01:13:58.272
Yeah.

01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:01.959
I lost money on you.

01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:03.120
What?

01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:04.952
Yeah, we all...
had bets going.

01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:06.752
Thought you were gonna win.

01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:09.673
Look, she was always gonna
do her own thing, wasn't she?

01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:11.796
She's mad like that, determined.

01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:14.115
Where is she?

01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:16.674
She's gone to London
with her fella. Last night.

01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:19.759
Wow, um...

01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:23.836
Did she leave any message
for me or anything?

01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:26.155
No.

01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:28.798
All right. No, uh...

01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:34.513
That's cool, yeah.

01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:35.959
Your songs are good.

01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:37.229
Thanks.

01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:31.436
Hold on to that
nice and tight there.

01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:35.475
That's... 71 inches.

01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:51.791
 Think I'm back
on the ceiling 

01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:25.156
Raphina?

01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:27.271
No, sorry.

01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:28.400
Hey, wait.

01:16:28.520 --> 01:16:29.350
What?

01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:30.794
Raphina.

01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:32.035
Who?

01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:33.479
Raphina.

01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:35.556
Oh, no, I'm Raphina's
younger sister.

01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:36.680
Sorry.

01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:39.837
No, you're not.

01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:42.349
What are you doing?
I thought you were in London.

01:16:54.040 --> 01:16:56.110
I mean, it was
a mad idea, anyway.

01:16:56.240 --> 01:16:58.549
Don't even know
anyone in London.

01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:00.875
I thought he had booked tickets.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:02.228
No.

01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:05.557
No, that was just an act
to get a ride.

01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:07.233
He doesn't even have a flat

01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:09.112
or friends or any of that.

01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:12.592
So where is he now?

01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:14.597
I don't know.

01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:16.836
He left me in a B and B in town.

01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:18.473
We had this big row.

01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:20.397
He said I wasn't
pretty enough to be a model,

01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:22.954
and that I was too small.

01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:25.674
Kinda true. I'm pretty short.

01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:28.837
What happened to your cheek?

01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:31.474
Did he hit you?

01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:33.556
Yeah, but I totally deserved it.

01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:42.993
So what are you gonna do now?

01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:44.314
I don't know.

01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:46.913
I was gonna print some CVs,

01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:48.400
but I haven't
really done anything,

01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:50.835
except your videos.

01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:54.032
McDonald's have an ad
in their window.

01:17:54.160 --> 01:17:56.116
Would you still fancy me
if I did that?

01:17:56.240 --> 01:17:57.912
"D'you want chips with that?"

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.833
As long as you're happy.

01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:08.717
So that's my life now.

01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:12.557
Working at McDonald's,

01:18:12.680 --> 01:18:15.831
hanging out with
a 15-year-old schoolboy.

01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:20.870
I'm exactly like my ma.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:22.877
I'm mad.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:26.399
I have to go now.

01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:28.033
I have a gig to rehearse for.

01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:29.639
Oh, tell me about that.

01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:31.716
No.

01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:28.916
Will you help me write a song?

01:19:30.280 --> 01:19:32.236
Always.

01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:35.680
F sharp minor.

01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:37.551
And E.

01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:39.671
Just keep doing that.

01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:47.870
Why doesn't
she believe in destiny?

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.070
Well...

01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:51.997
she was always going on
about London.

01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:53.678
It was so important to her,

01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:55.870
almost like
part of her identity.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:59.470
But maybe it was just
in her head.

01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:01.670
And it wasn't really
her destiny at all.

01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:04.030
Why don't you
take her to London?

01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:08.834
How much is
a plane ticket to London?

01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:10.678
Yeah.

01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:12.950
Anyway, what about the band?

01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:14.593
The band will be fine.

01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:16.915
Just go to London
and get a record deal.

01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:19.753
Come back and just
get us out of this shithole.

01:20:19.880 --> 01:20:21.313
That's not a bad idea, actually.

01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:22.440
Mm.

01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:29.394
 You were racin'
like a cannonball... 

01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:30.794
Nice.

01:20:31.840 --> 01:20:32.909
Yeah.

01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:34.359
Make a nice piano bit.

01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:35.515
Yeah.

01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:38.600
Shit!

01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:43.553
Take him down!

01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:04.552
I'm sorry
that I didn't know about

01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:06.557
you playing guitar
and everything.

01:21:06.680 --> 01:21:07.829
It's cool.

01:21:07.960 --> 01:21:10.758
There's a lot of stuff
you don't know about me.

01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:13.394
You should come play a solo,
at the gig.

01:21:14.440 --> 01:21:15.793
Okay, I probably will.

01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:16.936
You know, it's been a,
it's been a while

01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:18.791
since you've been
out of the house.

01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:21.800
Well, I'm here now, aren't I?

01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:24.433
Okay.

01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:26.949
So I'll see you there, then.

01:21:27.080 --> 01:21:28.399
Yeah. Cool.

01:21:28.520 --> 01:21:30.397
Sounds like it could be fun.

01:21:30.520 --> 01:21:32.272
Cool. All right.

01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:34.038
See you later.

01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:41.030
Cool, she's not here.

01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:45.936
Do you know
where the photocopier is?

01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:47.416
- Yeah.
- Photocopy 200 of these.

01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:48.555
Why?

01:21:48.680 --> 01:21:50.796
You'll see.

01:21:50.920 --> 01:21:52.194
Come on, Darren.

01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:55.392
We've got one more thing to do.

01:21:56.680 --> 01:21:58.193
Now leave this to me.

01:21:58.320 --> 01:21:59.753
Yeah.

01:22:02.280 --> 01:22:03.872
Who's that, Barry?

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:05.991
If it's the TV license man,
tell him to piss off.

01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:07.792
What do yous want?

01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:09.896
- We want to talk to you.
- Shut up, you stupid bitch!

01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:11.536
You know what, Barry,
you think you're different

01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:12.959
from us, and you are.

01:22:13.080 --> 01:22:14.513
You're bleedin' nuts.

01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:16.640
We all have one thing
in common... me, you and him.

01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:19.718
We're all shit at school.
We're bleedin' useless.

01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:21.398
- So?
- What are you gonna do

01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:22.840
when you get kicked out
of school?

01:22:22.960 --> 01:22:24.200
Stay at home with your ma and da

01:22:24.240 --> 01:22:25.832
watching day-time telly,
getting wasted?

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:27.228
Yeah, okay.

01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:29.237
Well, we're gonna be in a band.

01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:30.952
Gigging, on the road.

01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:33.469
Different venues each night,
different women.

01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:35.079
And d'you know what bands need?

01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:36.713
What do bands need?

01:22:36.840 --> 01:22:38.671
Roadies.

01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:39.949
Someone who is strong.

01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:41.513
Someone who can fight.

01:22:41.680 --> 01:22:43.496
Get in here, Barry,
and get us another beer!

01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:44.936
You worthless shite!

01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:46.518
I'm a worthless shite.

01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:48.995
I mean, what would you want
with me in a fag band?

01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:51.429
Being in a band
is like being in the army.

01:22:51.560 --> 01:22:54.028
Everyone has everyone's back.

01:22:54.160 --> 01:22:56.390
D'you think you're up for it?

01:22:56.520 --> 01:22:59.159
Get in here
and get us another can, Barry,

01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:01.296
or do you want another smack?!

01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:05.590
Where do you think
you're going?!

01:23:05.720 --> 01:23:07.278
Get back here, you little prick!

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:07.513
Okay, that was good,

01:24:07.640 --> 01:24:09.471
but now it's time
for some live music.

01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:22.916
Faggots!

01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:24.712
Hello, Dublin.

01:24:24.840 --> 01:24:26.717
We're Sing Street from Dublin.

01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:29.394
Faggot!

01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:30.999
Dad, you shouldn't have
come here

01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:32.633
if you're just gonna slag us.

01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:37.030
This is called "Girls."

01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:53.269
 Sometimes I pull
myself apart 

01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:57.638
 I shift my shape
the way I change my colors 

01:24:57.760 --> 01:24:59.955
 Guess I'm a human
work of art 

01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:07.549
 Truth gets distorted
by the facts 

01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:13.069
 Peace is in danger
and the trust gets broken 

01:25:13.200 --> 01:25:15.873
 Love always
comes under attack 

01:25:17.160 --> 01:25:19.116
 But at the end
of all of this 

01:25:23.480 --> 01:25:28.952
 Boys know that the girls
are so complicated 

01:25:31.240 --> 01:25:35.597
 Let go, can you feel
your heart liberated 

01:25:35.720 --> 01:25:38.951
 By the complicated boys,
boys, boys, boys? 

01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:43.517
 And the complicated girls,
girls, girls, girls 

01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:48.033
 We're all just diamonds
in the rough 

01:25:48.200 --> 01:25:52.671
 I'm still a stranger
in the bathroom mirror 

01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:54.836
 Stare at me long
and hard enough 

01:25:56.880 --> 01:25:59.110
 You might see someone
that you love 

01:25:59.240 --> 01:26:00.593
Faggots!

01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:03.792
 All the complicated boys,
boys know 

01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:07.230
 That the girls
are so complicated 

01:26:08.800 --> 01:26:11.997
 Try to open up your mind,
let go 

01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:14.395
 Can you feel
your heart liberated 

01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:18.269
 By the complicated boys,
boys, boys, boys? 

01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:22.638
 And the complicated girls,
girls, girls, girls 

01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:26.435
 By the complicated boys,
boys, boys, boys 

01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:30.599
 And the complicated girls,
girls, girls, girls 

01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:42.396
That was shite!

01:26:42.520 --> 01:26:46.433
 This girl
is a beautiful sea 

01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:52.870
 The girl
is a beautiful sea. 

01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:56.237
Thank you.

01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:00.558
Yes.

01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:02.875
Come on, keep going!

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:04.911
Get off the stage!

01:27:06.760 --> 01:27:10.309
Okay, here's one called
"To Find You."

01:27:10.440 --> 01:27:11.634
It's a slow song.

01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:16.509
Conor, we're not playing
a bleedin' slow song at a gig.

01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:18.471
- Are you mad?
- No?

01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:20.238
They love us. We'll blow it.

01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:21.360
Eamon?

01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:23.675
I don't know, it's a bold move.

01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:27.071
Let's do it.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.116
Okay,

01:27:31.240 --> 01:27:33.879
this song's for anyone who
thought they had a girlfriend

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:37.390
for a day, but then she just
turned out to be a friend.

01:27:37.560 --> 01:27:40.028
What's that about?

01:27:46.920 --> 01:27:53.951
 When you were starin'
at your bedroom wall 

01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:05.792
 Somewhere out where the wind
was calling 

01:28:23.680 --> 01:28:29.118
 When you were racin'
like a cannonball 

01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:34.839
 In roller skates
and sky blue 

01:28:37.120 --> 01:28:41.875
 Or in the backseat watching
the slow rain fallin' 

01:28:51.480 --> 01:28:58.113
 I gotta find out
who I'm meant to be 

01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:10.834
 But with every word
you swear to me 

01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:16.637
 All my beliefs
start caving in 

01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:33.797
 Bring the fire,
bring the fall 

01:29:33.920 --> 01:29:40.155
 I know I'll get
my heart through 

01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:45.792
 But from the day
I started crawlin' 

01:30:09.680 --> 01:30:15.676
 I was on my way
to find you. 

01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:43.079
Okay.

01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:45.475
So this is our last song,
so come back in.

01:30:45.600 --> 01:30:47.272
Don't worry, it's a fast one.

01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:49.296
It's about this school,
and it's for Brother Baxter.

01:30:49.320 --> 01:30:50.833
Lights!

01:30:50.960 --> 01:30:53.838
Oh, oh, yeah, right.

01:30:58.960 --> 01:31:01.679
Hey! Hey!

01:31:01.800 --> 01:31:03.836
Leave that light switch alone.

01:31:03.960 --> 01:31:05.176
Didn't you hear
what I told you?!

01:31:05.200 --> 01:31:06.394
Hey!

01:31:13.960 --> 01:31:15.598
You think that's funny?

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:21.877
Don't you push it now,
d'you hear me?

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:23.558
What? It's a tribute song.

01:31:23.680 --> 01:31:25.336
If you want to keep this band
going next term,

01:31:25.360 --> 01:31:26.236
you'd better be careful.

01:31:26.360 --> 01:31:27.588
- Okay?
- Yeah, okay.

01:31:27.720 --> 01:31:28.720
Go on, Conor!

01:31:28.840 --> 01:31:31.149
Are you ready?

01:31:31.280 --> 01:31:32.856
This could be all of ours
first and last gig, man.

01:31:32.880 --> 01:31:33.710
You ready to do it?

01:31:33.880 --> 01:31:35.791
Let's go.

01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:37.876
Okay, so this is our last song.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:39.752
This is called "Brown Shoes,"

01:31:39.880 --> 01:31:41.280
and it's for every
Christian Brother

01:31:41.320 --> 01:31:42.594
and every bully you ever knew.

01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:12.512
 So who the hell are you
to tell me what to do? 

01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:15.871
 You wear a dress and tell me
not to wear brown shoes 

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:17.513
 D'you think
you're man enough 

01:32:17.640 --> 01:32:22.077
 To wash the makeup
off my face right now? 

01:32:22.200 --> 01:32:24.998
 Don't you know
the bigger that they are 

01:32:28.200 --> 01:32:31.272
 And the boot's
on the other foot now 

01:32:31.440 --> 01:32:34.591
 Buckle up,
we're takin' you down 

01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:38.759
 See, your curtain's fallin',
so take your bow 

01:32:48.440 --> 01:32:51.557
 And who the hell is he
to tell me who to be? 

01:32:51.680 --> 01:32:54.911
 If he wants me dancin',
he can watch on MTV 

01:32:55.040 --> 01:32:57.873
 You try to shut me up,
I'll turn the volume up 

01:33:01.280 --> 01:33:03.999
 Don't you know
the bigger that they are 

01:33:07.400 --> 01:33:10.790
 Yeah, the boot's
on the other foot now 

01:33:10.920 --> 01:33:13.514
 Buckle up,
we're takin' you down 

01:33:13.640 --> 01:33:19.112
 See, your curtain's fallin',
so take your bow 

01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:24.429
 What's gonna define
the rest of your life? 

01:33:28.560 --> 01:33:33.759
 Sharp end of your knife
is pointing at you 

01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:40.032
 Just hangin' around
in gravity boots 

01:33:40.160 --> 01:33:46.554
 You're stuck in the past,
I'm writing the future 

01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:49.234
 Yeah, the boot's
on the other foot now 

01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:52.670
 Buckle up,
we're takin' you down 

01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:57.555
 And your mask is slippin',
so take your bow 

01:33:59.160 --> 01:34:02.436
 Yeah, you had your time
in the sun 

01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:05.677
 Does it hurt
when you're kickin' someone? 

01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:07.552
 'Cause the boot's
on the other foot 

01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:13.512
 Boot's on
the other foot now 

01:34:30.920 --> 01:34:32.239
Thank you!

01:34:32.360 --> 01:34:34.316
We're Sing Street!

01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:40.056
That was
Sing Street from Dublin.

01:34:40.080 --> 01:34:42.355
Shh, keep it down.

01:34:43.560 --> 01:34:45.630
Come in.

01:34:45.760 --> 01:34:46.760
Hi.

01:34:46.880 --> 01:34:49.440
Hey.

01:34:49.560 --> 01:34:50.913
Where are the parents?

01:34:51.080 --> 01:34:52.718
They're asleep.
How was the gig?

01:34:52.840 --> 01:34:54.512
Great.

01:34:54.640 --> 01:34:55.709
Hi.

01:34:55.840 --> 01:34:57.159
This is Raphina?

01:34:58.240 --> 01:34:59.275
We need your help.

01:34:59.400 --> 01:35:00.833
Can you drive us to Dalkey?

01:35:00.960 --> 01:35:02.279
What for?

01:35:02.400 --> 01:35:04.834
Well, granddad's little boat
is still moored there.

01:35:04.960 --> 01:35:07.269
We're gonna sail to England,
the two of us.

01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:09.960
We're all set. We just need
a lift to the harbor.

01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:11.229
Yeah, sure.

01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:12.713
When are you thinking of going?

01:35:12.840 --> 01:35:14.512
Now.

01:35:14.640 --> 01:35:16.870
Now?

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.230
Do you know anybody in England?

01:35:19.400 --> 01:35:21.152
- No.
- Do you have any sterling?

01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:23.032
No.

01:35:23.160 --> 01:35:25.310
- No?
- No.

01:35:26.440 --> 01:35:27.953
She has her photographs.

01:35:28.080 --> 01:35:30.958
I've my demo tapes and videos.

01:35:32.520 --> 01:35:34.192
Let's go. Get the keys.

01:36:17.920 --> 01:36:21.196
I'll see you, Mum.

01:36:21.320 --> 01:36:22.912
I love you.

01:36:28.760 --> 01:36:29.760
All right.

01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:06.759
Okay.

01:37:06.920 --> 01:37:08.399
You call as soon as
you get there.

01:37:08.520 --> 01:37:10.317
- No messing, all right?
- I will.

01:37:10.440 --> 01:37:13.034
Okay.

01:37:13.160 --> 01:37:15.355
All right.

01:37:15.480 --> 01:37:18.472
Hey, uh, before you go, I...

01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:22.269
wrote down some song lyrics.

01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:23.833
- Really?
- Yeah, it's pretty

01:37:23.960 --> 01:37:25.234
stream of consciousness stuff,

01:37:25.400 --> 01:37:26.913
but it's about this kid
and a girl.

01:37:27.040 --> 01:37:28.189
In the future.

01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:30.351
- Put some music to it sometime.
- Okay.

01:37:30.480 --> 01:37:32.550
Wish I'd done this.

01:37:34.200 --> 01:37:35.428
You'll probably die.

01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:36.560
But anyway, go on.

01:37:36.640 --> 01:37:37.675
Go.

01:37:39.400 --> 01:37:41.038
You should come and visit us.

01:37:41.160 --> 01:37:42.639
You seem like a mad bastard.

01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:44.159
Okay.

01:37:44.280 --> 01:37:45.680
You look after
that brother of mine.

01:37:45.720 --> 01:37:46.920
He's gonna be lost without me.

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.560
I will.

01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:14.473
Call you tonight.

01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:15.919
Right, go on. Go on.

01:38:16.040 --> 01:38:17.712
Away.

01:38:17.840 --> 01:38:19.239
All right, so we're gonna go

01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:20.616
around the island
and straight on.

01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:21.516
Straight to Wales.

01:38:21.640 --> 01:38:22.834
Okay. Straight on.

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:24.035
Straight on.

01:38:26.520 --> 01:38:27.520
All right.

01:38:27.640 --> 01:38:29.039
Right.

01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:30.275
Forward ho.

01:39:15.520 --> 01:39:18.318
Yes! Yes!

01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:21.191
Whoo!

01:39:55.440 --> 01:39:57.908
You're gonna want
to sit down around now.

01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:01.159
Why?

01:40:03.480 --> 01:40:05.710
That's why.

01:40:12.080 --> 01:40:13.433
Oh, my God.

01:40:13.560 --> 01:40:14.675
You okay?

01:40:14.800 --> 01:40:16.597
Yeah.

01:40:16.720 --> 01:40:17.755
Are you okay?

01:40:17.880 --> 01:40:19.359
Yeah.

01:40:19.480 --> 01:40:20.629
Conor!

01:40:23.280 --> 01:40:24.280
Jesus!

01:40:32.080 --> 01:40:33.399
Oh, my God.
