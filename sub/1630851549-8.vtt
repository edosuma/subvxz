WEBVTT

00:10.355 --> 00:12.805
Hey, Sarge,
you got a sec?

00:12.909 --> 00:14.773
Officer Badillo, yeah,
what can I do for you?

00:14.876 --> 00:17.120
Kind of a touchy subject.

00:17.224 --> 00:19.640
I'm all ears.

00:19.743 --> 00:22.608
- It's about my current partner.
- Mm-hmm.

00:22.712 --> 00:24.783
God, you realize
how awkward this is?

00:24.886 --> 00:26.302
We can discuss
any issues

00:26.405 --> 00:28.097
that you're having
with Officer Janko.

00:28.200 --> 00:29.822
If you say so.

00:29.926 --> 00:31.410
Look, Eddie's
nice and all.
Mm-hmm.

00:31.514 --> 00:33.792
But she's a bit too...
bubbly for me.

00:33.895 --> 00:35.863
"Bubbly"?

00:35.966 --> 00:38.107
I'm not the type of cop
who needs to walk

00:38.210 --> 00:39.729
every old woman
across the street.

00:39.832 --> 00:41.834
Is this you requesting
a new partner?

00:41.938 --> 00:43.664
I know she hates
riding with me, too.

00:43.767 --> 00:45.286
I'm sure you get an earful
of it at home.

00:45.390 --> 00:46.839
You're flirting
with the line there, Officer.

00:46.943 --> 00:49.359
See? Touchy subject.

00:49.463 --> 00:51.672
I have you two riding together
because of your differences,

00:51.775 --> 00:53.398
not in spite of them.

00:53.501 --> 00:55.158
I think you could learn
from each other.

00:55.262 --> 00:57.367
No offense, but the precinct
that I came from

00:57.471 --> 00:58.920
taught me all I need to know.

00:59.024 --> 01:01.130
You have your assignment.

01:01.233 --> 01:03.408
- Sarge, please?
- That'll be all, Officer.

01:07.964 --> 01:10.173
Well, if it ain't my least
favorite cousin Joey.

01:13.901 --> 01:15.627
Living with the rats these days?

01:15.730 --> 01:17.249
Moving in with
your own kind?

01:17.353 --> 01:18.906
Hey, keep it down, will you?

01:19.009 --> 01:20.804
I'm trying <i>not</i> to get whacked.

01:20.908 --> 01:22.116
Yeah, well, you should've
thought of that before you

01:22.220 --> 01:24.843
started working with the most
dangerous gang in New York.

01:24.946 --> 01:26.672
Anthony, please,
they're out for my head.

01:26.776 --> 01:28.433
You got to protect me.

01:28.536 --> 01:31.401
Yeah, well, you help us,
and then we'll help you.

01:31.505 --> 01:32.851
What do you mean, "we"?

01:33.886 --> 01:35.785
- Joey?

01:35.888 --> 01:38.305
This is Detective
Danny Reagan.

01:38.408 --> 01:40.652
This the cousinof yours

01:40.755 --> 01:42.481
who works for the Double Treys?

01:42.585 --> 01:44.759
Not for, with.
I clean money for them,

01:44.863 --> 01:46.382
that's all. I just may have
lost some of it.

01:46.485 --> 01:48.660
What, you invest in Beanie
Babies or something?

01:48.763 --> 01:50.903
Crypto. You know how
you're supposed to buy low

01:51.007 --> 01:53.389
and sell high?
Yeah, I didn't do that.

01:53.492 --> 01:54.976
Well, lucky for you,
I hit a wall

01:55.080 --> 01:56.875
on a double homicide,
which I think

01:56.978 --> 01:59.740
was carried out
by one of the Double Treys.

01:59.843 --> 02:01.293
Your cousin tells me
you're gonna help me

02:01.397 --> 02:03.675
- figure out who was responsible.
- Me?

02:03.778 --> 02:05.746
Yeah, you,
and then we'll protect you.

02:05.849 --> 02:07.886
What, do you want me to, like,
wear a wire or something?

02:07.989 --> 02:09.853
- Something like that.
- But if I go
anywhere near them,

02:09.957 --> 02:11.200
they'll kill me.

02:11.303 --> 02:12.339
You're gonna help us,

02:12.442 --> 02:13.719
or I'm gonna arrest you
right now.

02:13.823 --> 02:15.342
It won't be the first time,

02:15.445 --> 02:16.722
you rat bastard.

02:16.826 --> 02:18.897
<i>Ave, o Maria, piena di grazia.</i>

02:19.000 --> 02:20.209
- Shut up.
- Hey!

02:20.312 --> 02:22.487
What, are you lying
to God now, too?

02:24.316 --> 02:25.869
He's all yours.

02:25.973 --> 02:27.216
This way.

02:27.319 --> 02:28.803
Get him out of here.

02:32.738 --> 02:34.740
Erin.
Ah.

02:34.844 --> 02:36.880
Lisa, hi.
Erin.

02:36.984 --> 02:39.366
How are you?
God, you look great.

02:39.469 --> 02:41.333
Oh, and you're
perfect as always.

02:42.231 --> 02:44.681
You look exactly
like you did ten years ago.

02:44.785 --> 02:46.683
Stop, it hasn't been that long,
has it?

02:46.787 --> 02:49.652
I haven't seen you
since shortly after Cole died.

02:49.755 --> 02:51.861
Yes, that's right.

02:51.964 --> 02:53.966
How are things?

02:54.070 --> 02:56.279
Better. I remarried.

02:56.383 --> 02:57.798
Yes, I...

02:57.901 --> 02:59.040
I'm sorry I missed the wedding.

02:59.144 --> 03:01.560
Look, I-I didn't call
just to catch up.

03:01.664 --> 03:03.355
Word on the street is,

03:03.459 --> 03:05.012
you're considering
a run for D.A.

03:05.115 --> 03:07.601
Considered and dismissed.

03:07.704 --> 03:10.397
How did you find out
about that, anyway?

03:10.500 --> 03:12.330
This is my world, Erin.

03:12.433 --> 03:14.815
I just got the last mayor
- and A.G. elected.
- I know,

03:14.918 --> 03:16.782
I know, I've been following
your career.

03:16.886 --> 03:18.819
Then why didn't you call me?

03:18.922 --> 03:21.304
I would have told you not
to throw in the towel so soon.

03:21.408 --> 03:23.306
Why not?

03:23.410 --> 03:25.412
Because with my help,
you can win.

03:25.515 --> 03:27.690
It won't be easy,

03:27.793 --> 03:29.830
but I've done some soft polling
on your behalf.

03:29.933 --> 03:31.280
Have you?

03:31.383 --> 03:33.454
Don't pretend to be surprised.

03:33.558 --> 03:36.457
You knew what this lunch was
about and you still came anyway.

03:36.561 --> 03:38.735
Call it due diligence.

03:38.839 --> 03:41.013
I have known you
since law school, Erin.

03:41.117 --> 03:43.947
This is what you have
always wanted.

03:44.051 --> 03:46.087
Whether you'll admit or not.

03:46.191 --> 03:48.469
Well, if, if...

03:48.573 --> 03:50.678
I reconsider...

03:50.782 --> 03:52.818
where would we start?

03:52.922 --> 03:55.027
First we need
to run a background check.

03:55.131 --> 03:58.445
Scrutinize every part of
your public and personal life.

03:58.548 --> 04:01.620
So we know exactly where your
opponents will try to hurt you.

04:01.724 --> 04:04.313
That sounds invasive.

04:04.416 --> 04:06.763
But I can protect you.

04:12.528 --> 04:14.806
Yeah.

04:14.909 --> 04:17.326
Let's do it.

04:17.429 --> 04:20.743
The organization is called
POP-- that's short

04:20.846 --> 04:22.848
for Patrons of Police.

04:22.952 --> 04:24.954
And they have a strong support
and a surging

04:25.057 --> 04:27.059
membership from cops
all across the country,

04:27.163 --> 04:28.923
and their founder is

04:29.027 --> 04:31.650
former NYPD Detective
Kurt Quinn.

04:31.754 --> 04:32.893
I remember him.

04:32.996 --> 04:35.827
However... their communications

04:35.930 --> 04:39.382
make it look like you founded it
and you run it.

04:39.486 --> 04:41.660
They've harvested

04:41.764 --> 04:44.387
footage and audio of you on
the record over the past decade

04:44.491 --> 04:46.838
and made supercuts,

04:46.941 --> 04:49.427
putting you front and center
of their cause.

04:52.809 --> 04:55.087
I take it we're not talking
about a haircut here.

04:55.191 --> 04:57.469
Your face, your voice...

04:57.573 --> 04:59.816
their inflammatory context.

04:59.920 --> 05:01.611
But it's things
he's actually said.

05:01.715 --> 05:02.819
Footage of him saying it.

05:02.923 --> 05:04.821
Yes. But you talking

05:04.925 --> 05:06.823
about "broken window" policing

05:06.927 --> 05:08.929
playing over
footage of a mob

05:09.032 --> 05:10.793
smashing plate-
glass windows

05:10.896 --> 05:12.104
in Portland, Oregon.

05:12.208 --> 05:13.692
This ain't right.

05:13.796 --> 05:15.798
No, but...

05:15.901 --> 05:18.110
- it is their right.
- How?

05:18.214 --> 05:20.147
Public statements,
on the record,

05:20.250 --> 05:22.080
are in the public domain.

05:22.183 --> 05:24.772
- Sounds like identity theft.
- Pretty much.

05:24.876 --> 05:26.118
Minus the legal recourse.

05:26.222 --> 05:28.673
We can't sue for
defamation or something?

05:28.776 --> 05:30.709
Everything Frank said is
public-- we don't own it.

05:30.813 --> 05:32.435
Shut it down.

05:32.539 --> 05:33.781
It's not that simple.

05:33.885 --> 05:35.473
Nobody's putting words
in my mouth.

05:35.576 --> 05:37.682
You come out against them,
it's gonna piss off

05:37.785 --> 05:39.718
a whole lot of cops
across the nation.

05:39.822 --> 05:41.686
So he's supposed
to do what exactly?

05:41.789 --> 05:42.963
Nothing. Let it blow over.

05:43.791 --> 05:46.000
If there's nothing we can do,
why'd you bring it up

05:46.104 --> 05:48.140
- in the first place?
- You'd rather not know?

05:48.244 --> 05:51.005
Make a statement-- I got nothing
to do with Quinn or his group.

05:51.109 --> 05:53.145
We shouldn't engage--
it's a can of worms.

05:53.249 --> 05:55.527
Make the statement.

06:34.704 --> 06:35.671
Officer Janko, everything okay?

06:35.774 --> 06:36.948
No.

06:37.051 --> 06:38.915
No, no one's ever
gonna replace Witten.

06:39.019 --> 06:41.055
Jamie,
this Badillo guy,

06:41.159 --> 06:42.988
he's awful.

06:43.092 --> 06:44.852
Oh, not you, too.

06:44.956 --> 06:46.578
What does that mean?

06:46.682 --> 06:47.752
Did he say
something to you?

06:47.855 --> 06:49.029
Yeah, and I'll

06:49.132 --> 06:51.687
tell you what I told him--
make it work.

06:51.790 --> 06:53.930
"Make it work"? What kind
of management style is that?

06:54.034 --> 06:55.967
I put you two together
for a reason.

06:56.070 --> 06:57.589
I need you to trust it.

06:57.693 --> 06:59.591
Look, Jamie,
what's the point in forcing it

06:59.695 --> 07:01.766
if it's not working
for either of us?

07:01.869 --> 07:03.802
He can learn from your people
skills and your experience in

07:03.906 --> 07:05.873
this precinct, and you can learn
from his time in East New York.

07:05.977 --> 07:08.876
No, Jamie, that man will
never learn people skills.

07:08.980 --> 07:11.500
Think of it as yin and yang,
that sort of thing.

07:11.603 --> 07:12.915
It's more
like beauty and the beast.

07:13.571 --> 07:16.228
Come on, Jamie... it's torture.

07:16.332 --> 07:18.507
Eddie, I need both of you guys
to stop coming to me

07:18.610 --> 07:20.923
and do your jobs, end of story.

07:22.856 --> 07:24.858
Whatever, Sarge.

07:27.895 --> 07:30.242
Crimes lead to
the breakdown of communities.

07:30.346 --> 07:32.590
Minimum bail for felonies

07:32.693 --> 07:34.695
puts my officers at risk.

07:34.799 --> 07:37.733
We are convicted
without a defense.

07:37.836 --> 07:40.701
These complaints are
sheer fiction.

07:40.805 --> 07:42.876
When you start selectively
enforcing the law,

07:42.979 --> 07:45.016
bad guys start
selectively obeying it.

07:45.119 --> 07:48.709
And that will not be tolerated.

07:50.884 --> 07:53.334
Son of a bitch.

07:53.438 --> 07:56.993
The press has tried to mess
with my words, but not this.

07:57.097 --> 07:59.271
Never this.

07:59.375 --> 08:02.240
And that's just the latest one.

08:02.343 --> 08:05.001
So my statement...?

08:05.105 --> 08:06.969
Played out exactly
as I said it would.

08:07.072 --> 08:09.834
It only brought us
more negative attention.

08:09.937 --> 08:11.214
That an "I told you so"?

08:11.318 --> 08:13.182
Just a fact.

08:13.285 --> 08:15.943
Sid, what'd you find on Quinn?

08:16.047 --> 08:17.773
No complaints
when he was on the job.

08:17.876 --> 08:19.775
He was
a highly decorated detective

08:19.878 --> 08:21.259
whose career ended
after he was wounded

08:21.362 --> 08:22.778
in a shootout five years ago.

08:22.881 --> 08:24.400
Yeah, I gave him the medal.

08:24.504 --> 08:26.644
Former members of his squad
call him a natural leader.

08:26.747 --> 08:27.783
A cop's cop.

08:27.886 --> 08:30.613
- Checks out.
- Checks out how?

08:30.717 --> 08:31.925
He's lying to the public
by manipulating

08:32.028 --> 08:33.720
the commissioner's words
and image.

08:33.823 --> 08:35.653
Doesn't sound like a hero to me.

08:35.756 --> 08:37.793
Sounds like he <i>thinks
he's doing us a favor.</i>

08:37.896 --> 08:39.380
I want to meet with him.

08:39.484 --> 08:41.244
Out of the question.

08:41.348 --> 08:43.384
It wasn't one.

08:43.488 --> 08:44.938
A little help here?

08:45.041 --> 08:46.284
I don't see
the problem.

08:46.387 --> 08:47.423
I do.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.736
The leader of POP walks in here,

08:49.839 --> 08:52.842
it'll only add to the perception
that you're with him.

08:54.810 --> 08:57.847
So once again,
your advice is to do nothing?

08:57.951 --> 09:00.022
There's no playbook
for situations like this.

09:00.125 --> 09:02.611
The best we can do is
ride it out.

09:02.714 --> 09:03.715
That's all you got?

09:03.819 --> 09:04.958
What I'm saying is,

09:05.061 --> 09:06.822
I'm trying to save you
from yourself.

09:06.925 --> 09:08.927
Look, I don't care
if he's an ex-cop,

09:09.031 --> 09:11.309
I don't care if he has
an audience of cops,

09:11.412 --> 09:13.932
he's not putting words
in my mouth.

09:26.773 --> 09:27.981
Surprised you came.

09:28.084 --> 09:30.328
Eh, figured I owe
you a drink

09:30.431 --> 09:31.985
since you lent me
your cousin.

09:32.088 --> 09:34.021
Yeah, well, don't
thank me yet.

09:34.125 --> 09:35.851
He may be more trouble
than he's worth.

09:35.954 --> 09:38.681
Uh-huh, so what'd you
ask me down here for?

09:38.785 --> 09:40.890
I know it wasn't
for my company.

09:41.857 --> 09:44.066
Just try and take care
of Joey, will you?

09:44.169 --> 09:46.309
Didn't know you had
such a soft spot.

09:46.413 --> 09:48.726
Look, he's made mistakes,
but he's a good guy.

09:48.829 --> 09:50.728
Good guy, huh?

09:50.831 --> 09:53.040
I thought you said he was
a scumbag, jackass,

09:53.144 --> 09:54.317
no-good, criminal loser.

09:54.421 --> 09:55.525
Yeah, well, he is.

09:55.629 --> 09:58.390
Mm.
But when our grandma
passed away last year,

09:58.494 --> 10:00.772
he was at her house
every day for a week.

10:00.876 --> 10:02.740
I mean... the guy
barely slept,

10:02.843 --> 10:04.949
uh, taking care
of everything

10:05.052 --> 10:06.778
and making sure
everybody was okay.

10:06.882 --> 10:08.331
Look, he's an idiot.

10:08.435 --> 10:10.437
But he's got a heart.

10:10.540 --> 10:12.957
Just get him
through this in one piece.

10:14.199 --> 10:16.995
Why don't you do that yourself?

10:17.099 --> 10:19.377
What?

10:19.480 --> 10:21.482
I'm saying, you want to get him
through this in one piece,

10:21.586 --> 10:24.002
maybe you could
do it yourself by...

10:24.106 --> 10:27.005
partnering up with me,
then you could look after him.

10:27.109 --> 10:28.489
But you hate working with me.

10:28.593 --> 10:30.802
Well, hate is a strong word,
isn't it?

10:30.906 --> 10:33.011
Yeah, but every time we do,
it's a train wreck.

10:33.115 --> 10:35.945
True, but every time we do,
we get our guy.

10:36.049 --> 10:38.534
Yeah, but we never had to deal
with Joey in the process.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.432
Yeah, well, that's
why I'll have you

10:40.536 --> 10:42.020
along to help me babysit him.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.541
You sure?

10:45.645 --> 10:47.647
Well, I asked you, didn't I?

10:48.993 --> 10:51.029
Come on, family's family.

10:58.002 --> 11:00.176
And in regards
to your 2005 prosecution

11:00.280 --> 11:02.489
of Mr. Kindler,
who turned out to be innocent?

11:02.592 --> 11:04.491
I personally went
to the D.A. and argued

11:04.594 --> 11:06.389
that he be exonerated.

11:06.493 --> 11:08.944
I also stood in court
and had it dismissed.

11:09.047 --> 11:11.118
Well, I was expecting to find
some kink in the armor,

11:11.222 --> 11:13.086
but I have to admit,

11:13.189 --> 11:14.950
you look bulletproof.

11:15.053 --> 11:16.883
Great.

11:16.986 --> 11:18.436
I think I earned that drink.

11:18.539 --> 11:20.507
- Would you like one?
- Sure.

11:21.715 --> 11:23.855
Are you dating anyone
these days?

11:23.959 --> 11:25.615
- No.
- Really?

11:25.719 --> 11:28.135
Yeah, well, I don't have
a lot of time, so...
And Jack?

11:28.239 --> 11:29.861
Do you still see him at all?

11:29.965 --> 11:31.621
Occasionally.

11:35.039 --> 11:37.524
Is this us catching up,
or is this still work?

11:37.627 --> 11:39.457
Oh, we're not done yet.

11:39.560 --> 11:41.424
Who would you call
your best friend?

11:41.528 --> 11:43.150
Well, I guess I would say...

11:43.254 --> 11:44.600
Anthony Abetemarco.

11:44.704 --> 11:47.154
He's the detective
- you work with?
- Yeah.

11:47.258 --> 11:48.431
Do you ever have
drinks or dinner

11:48.535 --> 11:49.985
with anyone not from work?

11:50.088 --> 11:52.608
I have dinner with my family
every Sunday.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.575
With anyone not
from your family?

11:54.679 --> 11:56.198
Um...

11:56.301 --> 11:58.269
well...

11:58.372 --> 12:00.547
Okay, what do you do
for fun on the weekends?

12:00.650 --> 12:03.895
I... I guess
just the normal stuff.

12:03.999 --> 12:06.587
You know, like...
going to the movies and...

12:06.691 --> 12:08.106
You live alone, single,

12:08.210 --> 12:10.108
beautiful woman
in New York City.

12:10.212 --> 12:11.972
And you're telling me
you never go out?

12:12.076 --> 12:13.284
Never travel?

12:15.044 --> 12:16.943
Uh...

12:17.046 --> 12:19.014
no.

12:19.117 --> 12:21.602
Look, Erin, career alone

12:21.706 --> 12:24.019
will not win you
a major office these days.

12:24.122 --> 12:26.504
People will want to know you

12:26.607 --> 12:29.645
and like you as a person.

12:29.749 --> 12:32.613
So who is the woman
behind this tough exterior?

12:33.614 --> 12:36.100
Who is Erin Reagan, really?

12:53.738 --> 12:56.534
Well, he's here.

12:58.778 --> 13:00.780
Thank you, Baker.

13:05.715 --> 13:07.372
Welcome.

13:07.476 --> 13:09.409
Commissioner Reagan,
good to see you again.

13:09.512 --> 13:11.376
Yeah. Please have a seat.

13:11.480 --> 13:12.964
Thank you for
inviting me up.

13:13.068 --> 13:15.380
It's a real honor.

13:15.484 --> 13:18.694
Well, I'm afraid
this isn't a social visit.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.627
No, no, I know.

13:20.730 --> 13:22.387
We have a lot to talk about,
you and I.

13:22.491 --> 13:24.700
See, that's the thing.

13:24.804 --> 13:27.358
Uh, you mind if I call you Kurt?

13:27.461 --> 13:28.462
Of course!

13:28.566 --> 13:30.430
Well, the problem is, Kurt,

13:30.533 --> 13:33.398
you've been doing
my talking for me.

13:33.502 --> 13:35.435
No, that's not it.

13:35.538 --> 13:37.644
Quoting you
isn't talking for you.

13:37.747 --> 13:40.612
Well, it kind of is, Kurt.

13:40.716 --> 13:43.477
the way you cut together

13:43.581 --> 13:45.617
my words with your images.

13:45.721 --> 13:48.655
You're pushing an agenda
I haven't signed on to.

13:48.758 --> 13:50.381
No, you-you're taking this
all wrong.

13:50.484 --> 13:52.693
I'm reacting to what I see.

13:52.797 --> 13:54.799
We have the same agenda.

13:54.903 --> 13:56.594
I'm just quoting you

13:56.697 --> 13:58.458
the same way
you quote Teddy Roosevelt.

13:58.561 --> 14:00.391
With admiration
and respect.

14:00.494 --> 14:02.427
Not even in the same ballpark.

14:03.601 --> 14:05.603
"Truth doesn't age."

14:05.706 --> 14:08.019
Please don't quote me at me.

14:10.608 --> 14:12.506
Look, I'm sorry
if I overstepped.

14:12.610 --> 14:15.199
I thought you'd appreciate
the platform and the bullhorn.

14:15.302 --> 14:17.201
I already have plenty of both.

14:17.304 --> 14:20.273
Well, I'm giving a voice
to the side that needs one.

14:20.376 --> 14:22.240
To the cops who have been
disenfranchised

14:22.344 --> 14:23.517
these past couple years.

14:23.621 --> 14:25.623
Look.

14:25.726 --> 14:28.315
Maybe you have good intentions,
but your actions

14:28.419 --> 14:30.697
are way out of bounds--
do you understand that?

14:30.800 --> 14:33.320
I took a bullet for this city.

14:33.424 --> 14:35.564
And when I was forced
into retirement,

14:35.667 --> 14:38.670
where was the city
I sacrificed for?

14:38.774 --> 14:41.811
Railing against the police,
calling for us to be canceled.

14:41.915 --> 14:43.675
Yeah, look, I get all that.

14:43.779 --> 14:45.781
But that's not the issue here.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.748
I'll do whatever it takes

14:47.852 --> 14:49.681
to make things right.

14:49.785 --> 14:51.511
Then stop it.

14:51.614 --> 14:53.616
Today.

14:57.413 --> 14:59.381
Tell you what.

14:59.484 --> 15:01.590
You want to set
the record straight?

15:01.693 --> 15:05.180
Why don't you come on my podcast
and do it yourself?

15:05.283 --> 15:08.631
You'd ask me on your show
to directly contradict you?

15:08.735 --> 15:10.668
Why?

15:10.771 --> 15:13.429
Because what I'm doing is right

15:13.533 --> 15:16.363
and necessary,
and so I have nothing to fear

15:16.467 --> 15:18.434
from the truth.

15:24.440 --> 15:25.614
We just need you
to get the name

15:25.717 --> 15:27.340
of the guy they're
sending after you.

15:27.443 --> 15:29.549
It'll probably be
some trigger man

15:29.652 --> 15:31.309
who we like
for the double homicide anyway.

15:31.413 --> 15:32.552
Don't try and get cute.

15:32.655 --> 15:34.347
Get a name, get out.

15:34.450 --> 15:35.555
Right, okay.

15:35.658 --> 15:37.695
And you know if you get in
trouble to signal us, right?

15:37.798 --> 15:39.662
Uh...

15:39.766 --> 15:41.630
Talk about the weather,
knucklehead, the weather!

15:41.733 --> 15:43.390
The weather, right.

15:43.494 --> 15:44.564
Of course.
Okay.

15:44.667 --> 15:47.360
Look, try and relax, okay,
you're gonna be fine.

15:49.879 --> 15:51.398
Good luck.

16:03.548 --> 16:05.723
Hey, Buddy.

16:05.826 --> 16:08.174
What the hell
are you doing here?

16:08.277 --> 16:10.176
You been lifting?
You look jacked.

16:10.279 --> 16:12.281
Yeah.

16:12.385 --> 16:14.214
You know there's a price out
on your head, right?

16:14.318 --> 16:15.698
Nah, that's just
a big misunderstanding.

16:15.802 --> 16:17.321
Listen, you got
to help me.

16:17.424 --> 16:18.598
No way, man.

16:18.701 --> 16:19.633
Please, man.

16:19.737 --> 16:20.634
Nah, man, you're resourceful.

16:20.738 --> 16:22.257
Figure it out yourself.

16:22.360 --> 16:23.844
What'd you do the last time
you owed money?

16:23.948 --> 16:26.330
Stole from your grandma
or something like that?

16:26.433 --> 16:28.677
My Nona, what?! No way.

16:28.780 --> 16:30.575
Yeah, yeah, you said you camped

16:30.679 --> 16:31.783
out at her house
after she died,

16:31.887 --> 16:33.647
nicked a bunch of valuables

16:33.751 --> 16:34.752
right from
under your family's nose.

16:34.855 --> 16:36.271
You must be thinking
of someone else.

16:36.374 --> 16:37.824
You literally had me
pawn her watch.

16:37.927 --> 16:40.447
Vintage women's Rolex,
dust rose gold...

16:40.551 --> 16:42.656
Okay, okay, okay, look, I don't
really see what this has got

16:42.760 --> 16:44.382
- to do with anything.
- I'm gonna kill him.

16:44.486 --> 16:45.694
- Shut up, shut up.
- I swear I'm gonna kill

16:45.797 --> 16:47.351
- this bastard!
- Shh, take it easy.

16:47.454 --> 16:48.628
Let's see what he gets.

16:48.731 --> 16:50.285
Can you at least tell me

16:50.388 --> 16:51.700
who the trigger man is?

16:53.495 --> 16:55.738
What makes you think
I even know?

16:55.842 --> 16:58.810
Please, Buddy, it's my life
on the line here.

17:00.674 --> 17:02.573
I just want to know
what shoulder to look over.

17:04.402 --> 17:07.198
You ever stop being
a pain in the ass, huh?

17:07.302 --> 17:08.544
Just give me a name, and I swear

17:08.648 --> 17:10.477
you'll never see me again.

17:13.653 --> 17:15.689
Orlando Burns.

17:15.793 --> 17:18.416
He carries out
all the Double Treys' hits.

17:20.349 --> 17:21.557
I can't thank you enough.

17:21.661 --> 17:23.318
Get the hell out of here.

17:23.421 --> 17:25.665
Before I do you myself.

17:27.701 --> 17:29.807
Great, we got a name,
we're good.

17:32.154 --> 17:34.570
You remember when we egged
Craig McDermott's car?

17:34.674 --> 17:36.400
Yeah, well,
he should've thought twice

17:36.503 --> 17:38.057
before he decided to cheat.

17:38.160 --> 17:40.059
No, you're just mad
because he knew the answers

17:40.162 --> 17:42.475
to Professor Hutchinson's
questions before you did.

17:42.578 --> 17:44.304
Outdoing the teacher's pet
herself.

17:44.408 --> 17:45.788
Oh, whatever.

17:45.892 --> 17:47.652
Justice was served.

17:49.585 --> 17:51.587
Well, we had a good time,
didn't we, Mike?

17:51.691 --> 17:52.726
I did.

17:52.830 --> 17:54.383
I don't know that you ever did.

17:54.487 --> 17:55.453
I went to parties.

17:55.557 --> 17:56.592
Like once a year.

17:57.662 --> 17:59.457
Which is why I'm wondering

17:59.561 --> 18:01.459
why you invited me to lunch.

18:01.563 --> 18:03.979
What, I can't catch up
with an old friend?

18:04.083 --> 18:05.532
Knowing you?

18:05.636 --> 18:06.982
There's a career angle.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.397
So what, the D.A.'s office

18:08.501 --> 18:09.571
needs some legal work
farmed out?
No.

18:09.674 --> 18:11.607
No, nothing like that.

18:15.611 --> 18:17.441
Do you...

18:17.544 --> 18:19.753
do you like me, Mike?

18:21.824 --> 18:24.758
I did not see that coming, uh...

18:26.657 --> 18:28.314
Uh, I-I'm flattered.

18:28.417 --> 18:29.763
But I'm married

18:29.867 --> 18:31.662
- and I have a kid.
- Oh, no, no, no, no...

18:31.765 --> 18:33.698
n-nothing like that.

18:33.802 --> 18:37.046
Oh, oh, oh, I'm sorry! Uh...

18:37.150 --> 18:39.704
Uh, well, then...

18:39.808 --> 18:42.604
yeah, I like you.

18:42.707 --> 18:45.089
Well, why the,
why the hesitation?

18:45.193 --> 18:47.712
I like you.

18:47.816 --> 18:49.887
I can't say
that I really know you.

18:49.990 --> 18:52.372
Not anymore.

18:53.684 --> 18:55.720
You always put
your career first.

18:55.824 --> 18:57.688
You do that long enough,

18:57.791 --> 18:59.793
your relationships
just kind of fade away.

18:59.897 --> 19:01.968
And-and that's how you feel?

19:02.071 --> 19:03.694
About our friendship?

19:03.797 --> 19:06.490
Yeah.

19:12.496 --> 19:13.635
What the hell's the
matter with you?!

19:13.738 --> 19:15.084
I'm gonna kill you!

19:15.188 --> 19:16.569
You stole
from Grandma?!

19:16.672 --> 19:17.742
What the hell's
the matter with you?!

19:17.846 --> 19:19.019
I would not call it
stealing!

19:19.123 --> 19:20.055
She was dead after all.

19:20.159 --> 19:21.677
And you're about to be, too!

19:21.781 --> 19:22.816
All right, all right,
stop! Stop!

19:22.920 --> 19:24.749
- Stop!
- You piece of garbage!

19:24.853 --> 19:26.579
All right,
knock it off.

19:26.682 --> 19:27.649
What the hell are you doing?

19:27.752 --> 19:28.650
Yeah, Reagan, all good?

19:28.753 --> 19:29.754
There's nothing
to see here.

19:29.858 --> 19:31.653
Just a little
family discussion.

19:32.654 --> 19:33.827
Are you done?

19:33.931 --> 19:35.415
I'm just getting started!

19:35.519 --> 19:36.589
You piece of garbage!

19:36.692 --> 19:37.728
What is wrong with you?!

19:37.831 --> 19:39.557
He did the job.

19:39.661 --> 19:42.181
He got us a name, Orlando Burns.

19:42.284 --> 19:44.183
Great, so you can put me
in witness protection now?

19:44.286 --> 19:46.530
They don't even tell family
where they send you, right?

19:46.633 --> 19:48.808
We'll put you under protection
after you help us get Burns.

19:48.911 --> 19:50.154
But you said...

19:50.258 --> 19:52.156
I said you help us get our guy,

19:52.260 --> 19:53.882
and we'll help you,
that's what I said.

19:53.985 --> 19:56.505
But he wants to kill me.
Shh.

19:56.609 --> 19:58.542
Listen, he won't kill you

19:58.645 --> 19:59.853
as long as you have his money.

19:59.957 --> 20:02.166
- We can arrange that, right?
- Yeah, right.

20:02.270 --> 20:04.617
Good, problem solved.

20:06.791 --> 20:08.931
I should've chose jail.

20:09.035 --> 20:11.589
Yeah, you should have.

20:22.807 --> 20:24.637
Just hit the lights
and go through.

20:24.740 --> 20:26.501
No, we're not
responding to a job.

20:26.604 --> 20:28.537
Oh, come on,
there's no one even coming.

20:28.641 --> 20:31.264
Is that what you think
about being a cop?

20:31.368 --> 20:33.646
You can do whatever you want
whenever you want?

20:33.749 --> 20:35.855
How's it feel?

20:35.958 --> 20:38.996
Riding around all day,
with that stick up your...

20:39.099 --> 20:41.619
2-9 David, you have
a 10-30 at a liquor store

20:41.723 --> 20:44.208
located at 247th
and East 10th Street.

20:44.312 --> 20:45.623
Three perps, all possibly armed.

20:45.727 --> 20:47.625
No further description
at this time.

20:47.729 --> 20:50.697
That's two blocks from here.
Now can we light it up?

21:01.881 --> 21:04.297
Central said there's
three perps.

21:04.401 --> 21:06.126
We should wait
for backup.

21:06.230 --> 21:07.749
There's a side
entrance, look.

21:07.852 --> 21:09.578
We can surprise them.

21:09.682 --> 21:11.856
You want to get us killed?
Contain, wait for backup.

21:11.960 --> 21:13.962
They'll never see us coming.

21:17.828 --> 21:19.692
What the hell...?

21:19.795 --> 21:21.176
What the hell are you doing?!

21:21.280 --> 21:24.006
Damn it! 2-9 David,
where's that backup?

21:27.941 --> 21:29.943
2-9 David, we got shots fired!

21:30.047 --> 21:31.773
Okay, down on the ground!

21:31.876 --> 21:34.672
Nobody move! Keep your hands
where I can see them!

21:36.709 --> 21:38.814
Joined the party just in time
to clean up the mess.

21:44.061 --> 21:46.788
Put your hands
behind your back.

21:51.068 --> 21:53.691
That cowboy act could've
got us both killed!

21:53.795 --> 21:56.245
But it didn't, and I just
scored us three gun collars.

21:56.349 --> 21:58.006
Yeah, and you used
a warning shot to do it.

21:58.109 --> 22:00.215
- I should report you.
- That wasn't a warning shot.

22:00.319 --> 22:02.286
That was an accidental
discharge.

22:02.390 --> 22:04.184
But you wouldn't know
because you were outside,

22:04.288 --> 22:05.945
- waiting for backup.
- I thought you might've
been shot.

22:06.048 --> 22:08.361
And I charged in there for you,
and I could've been killed!

22:08.465 --> 22:09.742
I had it!

22:09.845 --> 22:12.158
You are the most selfish person

22:12.261 --> 22:13.815
I've ever met in my life.

22:13.918 --> 22:15.748
Go ahead and report me, then.

22:15.851 --> 22:17.888
You know, just rat me out
to your husband, why don't you?

22:17.991 --> 22:19.924
What's going on?

22:20.028 --> 22:22.306
Right on cue.

22:25.516 --> 22:27.691
What happened?

22:38.357 --> 22:40.359
Hey, got a sec?

22:40.462 --> 22:43.258
Yeah.
I need approval
for some marked bills.

22:43.362 --> 22:46.054
Okay.

22:46.157 --> 22:48.125
You ain't even gonna ask me
what they're for?

22:48.228 --> 22:50.921
I trust you.

22:51.024 --> 22:52.992
Okay.

22:53.095 --> 22:54.200
What the hell's going on here?

22:54.303 --> 22:55.753
You've been acting weird
all week.

22:59.412 --> 23:01.345
I've been speaking
to a political strategist

23:01.449 --> 23:03.312
about the possibility

23:03.416 --> 23:05.107
of me being elected D.A.

23:05.211 --> 23:06.661
That's great.

23:08.076 --> 23:09.836
Okay, uh, maybe not so great.

23:09.940 --> 23:11.838
If I decide to run,

23:11.942 --> 23:14.185
I need more...

23:14.289 --> 23:16.325
personality or something.

23:16.429 --> 23:19.294
I need to be more likable.

23:19.398 --> 23:21.020
I like you.

23:21.123 --> 23:22.953
Yeah, but would you like me

23:23.056 --> 23:25.369
- if we didn't work together?
- Of course.

23:25.473 --> 23:28.096
You think that you and I
would spend time together

23:28.199 --> 23:31.030
if we weren't being paid
to do so?

23:32.480 --> 23:34.723
Okay, probably not.

23:34.827 --> 23:36.449
Is this, uh...

23:36.553 --> 23:38.313
a midlife crisis or something?

23:38.417 --> 23:41.937
No... I spoke to Nicky
and Jack last night.

23:42.041 --> 23:44.940
Okay, so that answers
that question.

23:45.044 --> 23:47.184
Apparently all of my friendships

23:47.287 --> 23:50.359
and my marriage fell apart
because of my career.

23:50.463 --> 23:52.258
No offense, Erin.

23:52.361 --> 23:55.088
This is the life
you have chosen.

23:55.192 --> 23:57.436
Are you really
just realizing that now?

23:57.539 --> 24:00.231
No, but...

24:00.335 --> 24:03.062
maybe I'm just
processing it now.

24:05.444 --> 24:08.377
You think I made a mistake?

24:12.485 --> 24:14.901
How many years
have we sat across this desk?

24:15.005 --> 24:16.455
Twelve.

24:18.146 --> 24:20.148
And what hasn't come at us?

24:20.251 --> 24:23.082
Offhand? Nothing I can think of.

24:23.185 --> 24:26.223
We haven't always come out
bright and shiny,

24:26.326 --> 24:28.881
but we're still here, right?

24:28.984 --> 24:31.262
Out with it.

24:31.366 --> 24:33.161
Quinn asked me to be
on his podcast,

24:33.264 --> 24:35.025
and I said yes.

24:36.336 --> 24:38.166
Do I need to tell you

24:38.269 --> 24:40.306
what a terrible idea that is?

24:40.409 --> 24:42.342
Garrett, it's just a podcast.

24:42.446 --> 24:44.275
But for you, it's a trap.

24:44.379 --> 24:47.313
They also film that live.
It gets

24:47.416 --> 24:49.418
hundreds of thousands
of eyeballs.

24:49.522 --> 24:52.283
He's become
the Joe Rogan of ex-cops.

24:52.387 --> 24:53.595
All the more reason
to shut it down.

24:53.699 --> 24:55.494
You don't know
the rules to this game.

24:55.597 --> 24:57.357
One misstep, the buzzer sounds.

24:57.461 --> 25:00.119
If I have no say in the rules,
then I don't play by them.

25:00.222 --> 25:02.397
What are you planning to say?

25:05.504 --> 25:06.988
I don't know.

25:07.091 --> 25:08.403
Well, if you do this,

25:10.992 --> 25:13.132
that you're trying
to torpedo a hero cop

25:13.235 --> 25:15.203
you yourself decorated,

25:15.306 --> 25:18.206
or that you're cozy with a bunch
of rah-rah wingnuts.

25:18.309 --> 25:20.898
Which one is the lesser
of two evils?

25:21.002 --> 25:22.244
I don't know.

25:22.348 --> 25:24.177
That's two "I don't knows"
in a row.

25:26.007 --> 25:26.939
You done?

25:27.042 --> 25:30.114
No. I'm not.

25:30.218 --> 25:33.117
You need to think about
the 12 years across this desk

25:33.221 --> 25:35.119
and how much you've
actually listened to me.

25:35.223 --> 25:36.535
I listen to everything you say.

25:36.638 --> 25:39.020
But it goes in one ear,
out the other!

25:41.540 --> 25:43.369
You're on your own here.

25:53.103 --> 25:54.414
Eddie. Hey, wait.

25:54.518 --> 25:56.382
I am not in the
mood to talk.

25:56.485 --> 25:58.073
Then just listen.

25:58.177 --> 25:59.592
Badillo was in the wrong.

25:59.696 --> 26:01.456
Okay? He should've never handled
the robbery that way.

26:01.560 --> 26:02.975
And, trust me,
I'll address that with him.

26:03.078 --> 26:05.080
He has no business
being a cop.

26:05.184 --> 26:07.082
Don't give up on him yet.

26:07.186 --> 26:08.843
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

26:08.946 --> 26:10.499
Jamie,

26:10.603 --> 26:14.193
there is no way I am riding
with him after this.

26:14.296 --> 26:15.919
When he first transferred
to the precinct,

26:16.022 --> 26:17.161
you did a background
check on him.

26:17.265 --> 26:18.335
But you didn't find everything.

26:18.438 --> 26:19.923
What are you talking about?

26:20.026 --> 26:21.407
Badillo can't
keep down a partner

26:21.510 --> 26:23.927
because his first one
was killed in front of him

26:24.030 --> 26:25.445
five years ago in East New York.

26:25.549 --> 26:27.551
Five years.

26:29.035 --> 26:31.417
That cop
that was executed in their RMP?

26:31.520 --> 26:33.143
Yeah. Badillo was
riding shotgun.

26:33.246 --> 26:35.179
I talked to
his old C.O.

26:35.283 --> 26:38.044
I don't think he's ever
really gotten over it.

26:38.148 --> 26:41.220
Why didn't anyone tell me that?

26:41.323 --> 26:43.291
Why wouldn't <i>you</i> tell me that?

26:45.327 --> 26:47.088
When I lost Vinny,
the last thing I wanted

26:47.191 --> 26:49.331
was anyone bringing him up.

26:49.435 --> 26:51.368
Or, even worse, to pity me.

26:52.611 --> 26:55.372
But I still think about him
all the time.

26:55.475 --> 26:58.444
If my partner is
a walking case of PTSD,

26:58.547 --> 27:00.308
don't you think
I should know that?

27:00.411 --> 27:03.104
After today, yes.

27:03.207 --> 27:05.969
And I'm sorry
I didn't tell you sooner.

27:06.072 --> 27:08.005
But that's why I want you
partnered with him.

27:08.109 --> 27:09.144
So that you can do for him

27:09.248 --> 27:10.559
what you did for me
when I lost Vinny.

27:12.251 --> 27:14.149
Will you help him?

27:20.293 --> 27:21.467
No mercy, no quarter.

27:21.570 --> 27:23.124
I mean, it's the only way
to beat 'em.

27:23.227 --> 27:24.366
That sounds intense.

27:24.470 --> 27:27.507
Oh, it is. You couldn't imagine
fiercer opposition.

27:27.611 --> 27:29.337
- Right.
- What are their names again?

27:29.440 --> 27:31.960
Elizabeth and Mary-Ann.

27:32.064 --> 27:33.099
Oh.

27:33.203 --> 27:35.239
I didn't know you
even played bridge.

27:35.343 --> 27:37.310
Well, I just joined a club
a couple of weeks ago.

27:37.414 --> 27:39.243
You sure they're not
just letting you win, Gramps?

27:39.347 --> 27:40.279
Of course not.

27:40.382 --> 27:42.246
I'm just a fast learner.

27:42.350 --> 27:45.387
- Mm-hmm.
- One of 'em made those
cookies on the counter.

27:45.491 --> 27:46.319
- Wow.
- Oh, and the pies

27:46.423 --> 27:47.389
in the fridge?

27:47.493 --> 27:49.115
- Yes. The pies, too.
- Ooh.

27:49.219 --> 27:50.151
- Ooh!
Ooh.

27:50.254 --> 27:51.980
Which one's
the baker, Pop?

27:52.084 --> 27:53.326
Mary-Ann.

27:53.430 --> 27:54.534
Ooh!

27:54.638 --> 27:56.019
Ooh! I think

27:56.122 --> 27:57.399
Mary-Ann's got
a thang for you!

27:57.503 --> 27:59.539
No wonder he's winning.

27:59.643 --> 28:00.437
- And what does she
call you, Gramps?

28:00.540 --> 28:03.992
The silver fox
or the gray panther?

28:04.855 --> 28:07.099
She calls me <i>Henry.</i>

28:09.342 --> 28:11.068
You think she's angling
for an invite to Sunday dinner?

28:11.172 --> 28:13.105
Oh, yeah, like
that'll ever happen.

28:13.208 --> 28:14.347
Why not?

28:15.486 --> 28:17.385
We almost never have anyone
to dinner.

28:17.488 --> 28:20.491
Unless they're related
by marriage or blood.

28:20.595 --> 28:22.390
Lenny Ross, Maria Baez.

28:22.493 --> 28:23.736
Yeah, but they're cops.

28:23.840 --> 28:24.530
Joe Hill's mom.

28:24.633 --> 28:25.531
Family.

28:27.222 --> 28:28.499
Anyway, I'm not saying
it's a bad thing.

28:28.603 --> 28:30.294
It kind of sounds like you are.

28:30.398 --> 28:34.195
I'm just saying that we tend
to keep to ourselves.

28:34.298 --> 28:36.093
- Ah.
- We work.
And then when we relax,

28:36.197 --> 28:38.061
we talk about work.

28:38.164 --> 28:39.787
Yeah, but it's family dinner.
It's right there in the title.

28:39.890 --> 28:41.547
And it is
the family business, so...

28:41.650 --> 28:43.480
So you're kind of being
a buzzkill, sis.

28:43.583 --> 28:46.310
Okay, I guess that's me,
Captain Buzzkill.

28:46.414 --> 28:48.105
Sorry I said
anything.

28:48.209 --> 28:49.555
Everything okay?

28:50.590 --> 28:52.109
Yeah.

28:52.213 --> 28:54.422
This have anything to do
with you changing your mind

28:54.525 --> 28:56.596
every other week
about running for D.A.?

28:56.700 --> 28:58.806
Anthony talked to you?

28:58.909 --> 29:00.531
Yeah, well,
we're working a case together.

29:00.635 --> 29:01.878
So is it back on?
Are you running?

29:01.981 --> 29:03.811
I'm just getting
the lay of the land.

29:03.914 --> 29:06.330
But why, uh,
the back-and-forth?

29:06.434 --> 29:08.056
I don't know.

29:08.160 --> 29:09.195
Is it for real
this time?

29:09.299 --> 29:10.645
I don't know.

29:12.474 --> 29:16.409
You know, I think maybe that's
enough shop talk, even for us.

29:16.513 --> 29:19.447
Sean, why don't you go in
the kitchen, get those pies?

29:19.550 --> 29:22.105
Let's see if this
Mary-Ann's a keeper.

29:22.208 --> 29:24.107
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.

29:33.944 --> 29:35.566
Nothing yet.

29:37.223 --> 29:38.846
Check out his six.

29:43.471 --> 29:45.128
Hands. Both of 'em.

29:45.231 --> 29:46.715
I'm unarmed.

29:48.234 --> 29:49.649
That the money?

29:51.203 --> 29:52.169
Open it.

29:52.273 --> 29:53.619
Slow.

30:00.488 --> 30:02.283
- How'd you get all this?
- You know,

30:02.386 --> 30:04.664
borrowed from family,
sold a kidney.

30:06.252 --> 30:07.288
You're sweating.

30:07.391 --> 30:10.394
Well, you do have
a gun pointed at me.

30:10.498 --> 30:12.431
Maybe I should put a
bullet in you anyway.

30:12.534 --> 30:13.846
Just for fun.

30:13.950 --> 30:15.675
I'd really rather
you didn't.

30:18.678 --> 30:20.197
Hopscotch.

30:20.301 --> 30:21.923
- What?
- Hopscotch.

30:22.959 --> 30:24.650
Means, like,
"take it easy."

30:24.753 --> 30:26.617
Hopscotch? What the hell
is he talking about?

30:26.721 --> 30:28.447
It's a code word
we used as kids.

30:28.550 --> 30:29.413
He's asking
for help

30:29.517 --> 30:31.277
and he forgot how to do it.

30:31.381 --> 30:32.554
W-W-Wait, wait, wait.

30:32.658 --> 30:34.971
He's got a gun on him.
We go out there now,

30:35.074 --> 30:36.455
he could whack him.

30:39.803 --> 30:41.322
Damn it. They moved.

30:44.532 --> 30:46.361
- They got him.
- Come on.

30:56.647 --> 30:58.339
We still got
the GPS

30:58.442 --> 30:59.512
in the duffel bag.

30:59.616 --> 31:00.893
We're about 30
seconds behind 'em.

31:00.997 --> 31:01.998
He'll be fine.

31:04.552 --> 31:05.967
Stopped moving.

31:06.071 --> 31:07.900
I see that.

31:09.419 --> 31:10.869
You want to wait for backup?

31:10.972 --> 31:11.697
Hell no.

31:24.537 --> 31:25.987
- Clear.
- Clear.

31:26.574 --> 31:27.886
Inside.

31:37.654 --> 31:39.035
You go that way.

31:50.011 --> 31:51.633
- Stay back.
- Police!

31:51.737 --> 31:53.601
Don't move! Drop the gun!

31:53.704 --> 31:56.707
Put your hands
where I can see 'em!

31:56.811 --> 31:57.743
I said drop it!

31:57.846 --> 31:58.917
I don't think so!

31:59.020 --> 32:00.090
He said drop it!

32:02.506 --> 32:03.059
Don't be stupid!

32:09.341 --> 32:10.825
Keep your hands
where I can see 'em!

32:11.999 --> 32:12.792
On your stomach! Right now!

32:12.896 --> 32:13.897
Joe, are you okay?

32:14.001 --> 32:15.381
I think so.

32:15.485 --> 32:16.451
Hopscotch!

32:23.562 --> 32:25.495
Police! Don't move!

32:25.598 --> 32:26.461
On the ground! Face down!

32:26.565 --> 32:27.738
Joey.

32:27.842 --> 32:29.706
Joey!

32:31.673 --> 32:34.780
I thought these vests were
supposed to be bulletproof.

32:34.883 --> 32:36.540
You're alive, ain't you?

32:37.852 --> 32:39.819
So are you.

32:39.923 --> 32:41.649
You owe me one, cuz.

32:42.753 --> 32:44.548
You two okay?

32:44.652 --> 32:46.999
Yeah. Never better.

32:49.829 --> 32:51.003
Get out of here.

32:52.936 --> 32:54.800
Cuff them.

32:54.903 --> 32:56.836
Let's go.
Get him out
of here.

32:59.046 --> 33:00.668
So, how are you feeling?

33:00.771 --> 33:04.706
Uh, honestly,
a little exhausted.

33:04.810 --> 33:06.846
I mean...

33:06.950 --> 33:09.642
I've handled attacks
on my career my entire life.

33:09.746 --> 33:12.645
But this personal side
has just...

33:12.749 --> 33:14.475
I don't know,
thrown me a little.

33:14.578 --> 33:15.959
I can tell.

33:16.063 --> 33:18.030
I heard you had lunch with Mike.

33:19.618 --> 33:20.929
Oh. He talked to you?

33:21.033 --> 33:22.483
We're still friends.

33:22.586 --> 33:24.450
Right.

33:24.554 --> 33:25.658
What did he say?

33:25.762 --> 33:27.971
Look, Erin-- no offense--

33:28.075 --> 33:30.456
but if my asking you
a few personal questions

33:30.560 --> 33:32.562
is going to throw you
for a tailspin,

33:32.665 --> 33:34.978
then maybe you aren't
ready to run for D.A.

33:36.566 --> 33:38.464
You honestly believe that?

33:38.568 --> 33:39.948
If you want to win, you have
to be the whole package

33:40.052 --> 33:41.985
and have your
head on straight.

33:42.089 --> 33:43.711
Do I think you can?

33:43.814 --> 33:44.988
Absolutely.

33:45.092 --> 33:46.852
Just maybe not right now.

33:46.955 --> 33:48.095
That's just it?

33:48.198 --> 33:50.028
I'm-I'm just forever judged

33:50.131 --> 33:51.512
because I couldn't do it all?

33:51.615 --> 33:52.927
I couldn't juggle family

33:53.031 --> 33:54.549
and the career
and the friendships and...

33:54.653 --> 33:57.000
Being judged is just the
reality of running for office.

33:57.104 --> 34:00.072
You want to know <i>my</i> reality?

34:01.763 --> 34:04.525
I worked my ass off to get here.

34:04.628 --> 34:06.837
I sacrificed
so much.

34:06.941 --> 34:09.771
You think I didn't feel
those sacrifices,

34:09.875 --> 34:12.464
that I-I didn't want to be going
to those parties

34:12.567 --> 34:13.844
or staying in touch with friends

34:13.948 --> 34:15.881
or saving my marriage?

34:15.984 --> 34:18.539
Those sacrifices look
different from the outside.

34:18.642 --> 34:20.023
They're hard to relate to,

34:20.127 --> 34:22.681
unless you communicate them,
like you're doing right now.

34:22.784 --> 34:24.959
I... I don't know.

34:25.063 --> 34:27.962
Maybe I'm too old-school.

34:28.066 --> 34:30.516
I mean, in my family,
we don't talk about hard work--

34:30.620 --> 34:31.483
we just do it.

34:31.586 --> 34:33.554
And if old-school
still won elections,

34:33.657 --> 34:34.969
you'd be a shoo-in.

34:37.765 --> 34:40.664
I'm returning your retainer.

34:40.768 --> 34:43.046
It was so good to see you again.

35:04.309 --> 35:06.518
Be a waste of time to try
and talk you out of it.

35:06.621 --> 35:07.588
That's correct.

35:07.691 --> 35:09.659
This is a gunfight,

35:09.762 --> 35:12.731
and you didn't even
bring a butter knife.

35:15.975 --> 35:20.048
I tracked down the 49 on
Quinn's shooting incident.

35:20.152 --> 35:21.981
It appears the
report was doctored.

35:22.085 --> 35:23.673
You could read it

35:23.776 --> 35:25.985
that he was shot in the back,

35:26.089 --> 35:27.884
at a full retreat.

35:31.681 --> 35:34.615
I thought you said
I was on my own here.

35:35.823 --> 35:37.583
And I thought it was my duty
to offer you

35:37.687 --> 35:39.585
the lesser of two evils.

35:41.139 --> 35:42.761
You gonna use it?

35:50.941 --> 35:52.080
We good to go?

35:55.774 --> 35:57.672
Yeah.

35:59.881 --> 36:01.745
Are you?

36:01.849 --> 36:02.677
I'm sorry?

36:02.781 --> 36:04.645
Good to go?

36:04.748 --> 36:06.888
Look, I know you're
gonna come at me.

36:06.992 --> 36:08.959
But we can have a constructive
difference of opinion

36:09.063 --> 36:10.996
without tearing
each other apart.

36:11.099 --> 36:12.722
Yeah. Well, I just thought

36:12.825 --> 36:16.243
you should get
a little peek at my hand.

36:16.346 --> 36:19.073
The incident report
on your shooting was incomplete.

36:19.177 --> 36:21.662
So I got the original.

36:22.663 --> 36:24.182
And guess what.

36:29.808 --> 36:32.742
Didn't think you'd stoop
to character assassination.

36:32.845 --> 36:34.157
It's just the truth.

36:36.055 --> 36:37.816
You pinned that medal on me.

36:37.919 --> 36:38.713
And the guy who got played

36:38.817 --> 36:41.026
always comes off
as the bigger chump.

36:41.129 --> 36:43.131
You want to be that guy?

36:44.823 --> 36:46.342
Didn't think so.

36:46.445 --> 36:49.862
Are you familiar with the phrase
"mutually assured destruction"?

36:50.932 --> 36:52.106
He's got too much to lose.

36:52.210 --> 36:54.833
And yet somehow he doesn't seem
to realize it.

36:54.936 --> 36:56.006
Look at him.

37:01.391 --> 37:04.670
So, we good to go?

37:09.779 --> 37:12.333
I need to talk to my producer.

37:19.375 --> 37:21.411
I'm gonna pretend
you were bluffing.

37:21.515 --> 37:23.655
For my own sanity.

37:24.897 --> 37:26.382
Yeah, I guess I was bluffing.

37:26.485 --> 37:30.903
I mean, that would have been a
pretty low-down piece of work.

37:32.871 --> 37:34.148
Do you think he'll give it up?

37:34.976 --> 37:37.841
I think he's committed to
what he sees as his mission,

37:37.945 --> 37:40.361
so... he won't give it up.

37:40.465 --> 37:41.776
And, what the hell,

37:41.880 --> 37:43.433
that may be a good thing.

37:45.055 --> 37:47.334
But...

37:47.437 --> 37:49.715
he won't have me.

37:49.819 --> 37:51.061
So, thank you.

37:55.169 --> 37:56.446
We really needed
to go all the way

37:56.550 --> 37:58.103
to the other end
of the precinct for our meal?

37:58.206 --> 37:59.449
Shut up.

38:05.110 --> 38:06.836
What the hell is this?

38:07.906 --> 38:09.942
I know about your old partner.

38:10.046 --> 38:11.703
Five years.
I mean, that's a long time.

38:11.806 --> 38:13.256
Are you seriously doing this?

38:13.360 --> 38:14.809
They've stopped counting
how many partners

38:14.913 --> 38:16.466
you've gone through since.

38:17.433 --> 38:20.781
So what is it? A-Are you afraid
to invest in someone else?

38:22.507 --> 38:23.784
Are you afraid
you might lose them, too?

38:23.887 --> 38:25.406
You don't know anything.

38:25.510 --> 38:27.443
And you're my partner,
not my therapist.

38:27.546 --> 38:30.308
Well, you need to figure out
if you can do this job or not.

38:30.411 --> 38:32.137
'Cause riding with someone else

38:32.240 --> 38:34.312
is sort of in
the job description.

38:34.415 --> 38:35.727
Yeah.

38:35.830 --> 38:36.866
Whatever.

38:36.969 --> 38:38.764
Look, you're not the only one

38:38.868 --> 38:40.214
who's ever lost a partner.

38:42.596 --> 38:44.874
Sergeant Reagan,
he lost his, too.

38:44.977 --> 38:46.807
Um...

38:46.910 --> 38:48.774
Right before I met him.

38:50.500 --> 38:52.399
He didn't want
to ride with me either.

38:53.261 --> 38:54.884
You're saying
I'm husband material?

38:54.987 --> 38:56.817
In your dreams.

38:58.094 --> 38:59.406
Look, I get
that you got issues,

38:59.509 --> 39:00.855
Badillo, I do.

39:00.959 --> 39:03.271
And I get
that it's gonna take you... time

39:03.375 --> 39:05.273
to work
through those.

39:05.377 --> 39:07.379
But if we can't figure out
how to trust

39:07.483 --> 39:09.036
and respect one another,

39:09.139 --> 39:12.108
it is going to be our names
up there next.

39:16.077 --> 39:17.009
Okay.

39:17.113 --> 39:18.356
Okay?

39:19.978 --> 39:21.359
I got you.

39:23.153 --> 39:24.154
Good.

39:25.639 --> 39:27.226
How many times
you practice that speech?

39:31.058 --> 39:33.232
More times than you can count.

39:34.958 --> 39:35.994
What are you doing here?

39:36.097 --> 39:37.478
You weren't picking up
your phone.

39:37.582 --> 39:38.859
Yeah, I was trying
to disconnect.

39:38.962 --> 39:40.067
I've had a tough week.

39:40.170 --> 39:41.344
Hey, you're telling me.

39:41.448 --> 39:43.450
And that's why I came by to see

39:43.553 --> 39:46.142
if my BFF wants to go
for a beer.

39:46.245 --> 39:47.143
Your BFF?

39:47.246 --> 39:48.386
That's you.

39:50.457 --> 39:52.079
Clearly, you've had
a few drinks.

39:52.182 --> 39:53.529
Oh, definitely.

39:53.632 --> 39:55.979
And, you know, whatever that
political consultant said

39:56.083 --> 39:57.118
is a load of crap.

39:57.222 --> 39:58.119
Okay, Anthony...

39:58.223 --> 40:00.398
Sure, giving 100% of yourself

40:00.501 --> 40:03.435
to your job is not healthy
on a personal level.

40:03.539 --> 40:05.403
But the citydeserves

40:05.506 --> 40:07.957
a D.A. that's that dedicated.

40:08.060 --> 40:09.165
Lisa knows
what she's talking about.

40:09.268 --> 40:10.477
No, she doesn't.

40:10.580 --> 40:12.133
Eh, you don't need
someone to tell you

40:12.237 --> 40:13.134
if you're ready or not.

40:13.238 --> 40:15.551
You know you are and so do I.

40:15.654 --> 40:18.036
I know you're trying
to make me feel better...

40:18.139 --> 40:20.176
And that's
what friends do.

40:20.279 --> 40:22.074
But it's also the truth.

40:23.697 --> 40:27.528
Now, are you gonna come have
a drink with me or what?

40:31.014 --> 40:32.050
How about three?

40:32.153 --> 40:33.569
Oh, yeah.

40:33.672 --> 40:36.537
And I know this
great karaoke bar.

40:36.641 --> 40:37.365
Karaoke?

40:37.469 --> 40:40.023
You're gonna love
my Mariah Carey.
