01:36.129 --> 01:37.622
How could l have been so stupid?

01:37.838 --> 01:40.754
How could l have left the country
without my driver's licence?

01:40.924 --> 01:43.129
Brenda, please, relax.

01:43.301 --> 01:44.581
Dylan, you don't understand.

01:44.761 --> 01:47.002
When l called home,
my dad was so furious

01:47.179 --> 01:48.803
he wouldn't get
on the phone with me.

01:48.972 --> 01:51.343
Well, at least he didn't say
something he'd regret later.

01:51.516 --> 01:52.796
No, he's saving it up.

01:52.976 --> 01:55.098
l mean, you've never seen
my dad really lose it.

01:55.269 --> 01:56.976
Okay, so he's gonna yell.

01:57.146 --> 01:59.601
l mean, Bren, he's a parent.
That's what they do, they yell.

01:59.773 --> 02:02.441
He'll get over it. Wasn't it worth it?

02:04.110 --> 02:05.390
Didn't we have a great time?

02:05.569 --> 02:07.893
l mean, come on,
we danced, we surfed.

02:08.071 --> 02:09.150
Bren, we had a weekend

02:09.364 --> 02:12.234
that the two of us will never forget
as long as we live.

02:12.867 --> 02:15.357
Yeah, it was totally perfect
until l blew it.

02:15.577 --> 02:17.035
Everything will be fine.

02:17.245 --> 02:19.201
You'll see.

02:20.748 --> 02:23.238
l'm sorry we had to drag you
all the way down here, Mr. Walsh.

02:23.417 --> 02:26.536
lt's not that we didn't believe her,
but we have rules and regulations.

02:26.711 --> 02:27.790
Right.

02:27.962 --> 02:29.835
They're right in there.

02:34.926 --> 02:36.669
Hello, Brenda.

02:37.095 --> 02:38.292
Dad, hi.

02:38.471 --> 02:39.964
Sir, l can explain.

02:40.181 --> 02:41.509
Let's get out of here.

02:43.683 --> 02:47.347
- Dad, l'm sorry about all this.
- Brenda, we'll talk about it later.

02:51.523 --> 02:53.147
l said, let's go.

03:38.103 --> 03:40.640
What the two of you did
this weekend is inexcusable.

03:40.813 --> 03:42.472
Sir, you can hold me
completely to blame.

03:42.648 --> 03:44.439
You're damn right l can.

03:45.442 --> 03:48.857
We opened our hearts
and our home to you, Dylan.

03:49.987 --> 03:51.895
l'm the caretaker of your trust.

03:52.072 --> 03:54.527
And by extension,
the trust your mother has put in me.

03:54.741 --> 03:56.863
But you have just broken that trust.

03:57.076 --> 03:58.700
Dad, it was my fault too.

03:58.911 --> 04:01.199
l am very well aware of that,
young lady.

04:01.914 --> 04:03.989
The other night, you said
that l could count on you

04:04.165 --> 04:05.575
to do the right thing.

04:05.750 --> 04:07.291
ls that what you thought
you were doing

04:07.460 --> 04:09.251
by lying to your mother and me?

04:10.003 --> 04:11.082
No.

04:12.589 --> 04:13.620
What about you, Brandon?

04:14.549 --> 04:16.588
Were you part of this too?

04:19.720 --> 04:21.712
l thought so.

04:21.930 --> 04:24.135
He told me
they went to the flea market.

04:26.142 --> 04:27.968
Then Kelly called
and said Brenda was spending

04:28.143 --> 04:29.305
the night at her house.

04:31.104 --> 04:33.559
Boy, you must all think
l'm a real fool.

04:33.773 --> 04:36.607
No, Mom. Where are you going?

04:37.526 --> 04:40.728
l'm gonna call Jackie Taylor. l think
she might want to know about this.

04:40.945 --> 04:43.067
Mom, please don't do that.

04:43.280 --> 04:44.524
Brandon...

04:44.698 --> 04:47.402
...l'd like to speak to Dylan and Brenda
in private, please.

04:48.785 --> 04:50.278
Sure.

04:52.121 --> 04:53.780
lt is my opinion...

04:53.998 --> 04:56.488
...that this relationship
has certainly gone too far.

04:58.084 --> 05:00.870
And l think it's time for the two of you
to give it a break.

05:02.671 --> 05:04.579
Yeah, maybe l just better go home.

05:04.798 --> 05:05.877
Dylan.

05:06.049 --> 05:09.547
lt's okay, Bren. See you in school.

05:10.636 --> 05:11.916
Tomorrow.

05:24.772 --> 05:27.309
lf you want to punish me,
then you punish me.

05:27.483 --> 05:29.771
But don't blame Dylan.
lt's not his fault.

05:30.277 --> 05:34.854
ln fact, until we got to Baja,
Dylan didn't ever know that l--

05:35.490 --> 05:37.281
That you lied to us?

05:53.546 --> 05:55.372
Looking good.

05:57.049 --> 05:58.507
Yeah, it's almost finished.

05:58.675 --> 06:00.963
l was talking about you.

06:17.774 --> 06:19.730
- Where's your mom?
- lnside.

06:20.234 --> 06:21.977
Living a little dangerously,
aren't you?

06:22.945 --> 06:25.067
Well, you bring out
the wild side of me.

06:25.238 --> 06:27.194
Get out of here.

06:27.573 --> 06:30.359
l just feel totally myself around you.

06:30.576 --> 06:33.196
Like it's okay to say or do anything

06:33.412 --> 06:35.155
because you'll understand.

06:40.292 --> 06:41.833
Kelly.

06:42.252 --> 06:45.335
l just had a very disturbing phone call
from Cindy Walsh.

06:45.880 --> 06:46.911
About what?

06:47.131 --> 06:49.087
Did you tell her
Brenda spent the night here

06:49.258 --> 06:50.917
when she was really in Mexico
with Dylan?

06:53.470 --> 06:56.007
Yeah, but it wasn't my idea.

06:56.222 --> 06:57.763
Well, l don't care whose idea it was.

06:57.931 --> 06:59.757
You call Brenda's mom
and you apologise.

07:00.434 --> 07:01.465
Okay.

07:01.643 --> 07:03.220
Now. l am under enough pressure

07:03.394 --> 07:05.386
without having to deal
with this kind of nonsense.

07:05.563 --> 07:06.725
Okay.

07:07.272 --> 07:08.896
l'll see you later.

07:09.107 --> 07:10.898
Sure.

07:19.783 --> 07:22.949
Thanks a lot, Brenda.
l do you a favour and you rat on me.

07:23.119 --> 07:24.826
Kelly, l told you. l didn't rat.

07:24.995 --> 07:26.536
l got caught. There is a difference.

07:26.747 --> 07:27.778
You could have warned me.

07:27.956 --> 07:31.240
l had to listen to my mother yell at me
like some child, right in front of Jake.

07:31.459 --> 07:34.210
Well, l would have, but my parents
revoked my phone privileges.

07:34.378 --> 07:36.998
And what does Jake have to do
with this anyway?

07:37.172 --> 07:38.582
Believe it or not, l have a life.

07:39.590 --> 07:40.918
Well, l don't.

07:41.092 --> 07:43.416
Dylan and l aren't allowed
to see each other anymore.

07:43.635 --> 07:45.342
He's not coming to the wedding?

07:45.845 --> 07:47.588
Of course he's coming.

07:47.764 --> 07:50.336
Just don't seat him
anywhere near my father.

07:54.227 --> 07:55.970
Hey, chief.

07:56.187 --> 07:57.894
- Hey, ace.
- What's wrong?

07:58.064 --> 08:01.099
You don't sound like your normal,
gung-ho Monday morning self.

08:01.275 --> 08:02.816
l'm fine, fine, fine.

08:02.984 --> 08:05.818
No, no, no, you're not.
What's the matter?

08:05.987 --> 08:08.145
l thought l had made
some real friends at this school,

08:08.322 --> 08:11.488
but there's always been that small part
of me that is never sure.

08:11.700 --> 08:14.404
- What are you talking about?
- l didn't expect to be a bridesmaid,

08:14.577 --> 08:16.450
like Brenda or Donna,
but l thought at least--

08:16.620 --> 08:17.948
- Hey.
- No, l thought--

08:18.122 --> 08:20.244
l thought at least
that l would get an invitation.

08:20.457 --> 08:22.781
- What?
- Kelly didn't even invite me

08:22.959 --> 08:24.121
to her mother's wedding.

08:26.795 --> 08:28.336
Come on, Andrea,
l know you're invited.

08:28.505 --> 08:29.963
There must be some kind of mistake.

08:30.173 --> 08:31.583
Yeah.

08:31.758 --> 08:34.164
The mistake was l deluded myself
into believing

08:34.342 --> 08:36.251
that Kelly and l were friends.

08:38.388 --> 08:40.427
- Let me talk to her.
- No.

08:40.640 --> 08:42.928
No, if she wanted to invite me,
she would've invited me.

08:43.100 --> 08:46.384
At this point, l wouldn't go
even if she asked me.

08:54.359 --> 08:55.852
l told Kelly that her mom could have

08:56.027 --> 08:58.149
a few dozen peach pies
on the house for the wedding.

08:58.321 --> 09:01.819
But she turned me down.
l guess my pies aren't good enough.

09:01.991 --> 09:04.362
Oh, come on, Nat. Not you too.

09:04.534 --> 09:07.024
Everybody's getting so bent
out of shape about this wedding--

09:07.203 --> 09:09.408
Well, that's because
everyone's taking it so seriously.

09:09.580 --> 09:11.904
A wedding is supposed
to be a celebration,

09:12.082 --> 09:15.284
with lots of good homemade food
and dancing and children.

09:15.460 --> 09:18.662
Not some stuffy sit-down dinner
that's too good for pie.

09:18.838 --> 09:19.917
You tell them, Nat.

09:21.381 --> 09:23.622
- Hey, Dylan.
- Hey, Brandon.

09:23.800 --> 09:27.499
How's everything going
at the Walsh house of detention?

09:27.720 --> 09:30.388
Put it to you this way:
This isn't my shift.

09:30.555 --> 09:33.341
l'm just here to avoid spending
as much time at home as possible.

09:33.558 --> 09:35.135
Sorry to hear about that.

09:35.309 --> 09:37.100
Don't worry about it.
What's done is done.

09:37.269 --> 09:39.344
l didn't mean to make you
a part of this, you know?

09:40.438 --> 09:42.229
Just don't ask me to lie
for you guys again,

09:42.440 --> 09:45.060
- all right?
- Hey, it was your sister's bright idea.

09:45.568 --> 09:48.651
Still, you guys shouldn't have gone
down there in the first place.

09:48.862 --> 09:50.024
And why is that?

09:50.238 --> 09:51.613
Because my parents said no.

09:51.823 --> 09:53.566
You always listen to everything
they say?

09:53.783 --> 09:55.027
No, this is different.

09:55.242 --> 09:56.652
Whose side are you on?

09:56.868 --> 10:00.152
Dylan, l'm not on anyone's side.

10:01.497 --> 10:03.370
l understand
why my father is so angry.

10:03.541 --> 10:05.497
You and Brenda totally blew him off.

10:06.460 --> 10:09.164
So, what do l got to do
to square things with your old man?

10:13.382 --> 10:14.923
Look, Dylan,
you know l love you, man.

10:15.092 --> 10:17.084
lf there was something
that would patch things up

10:17.260 --> 10:19.418
between you and my dad,
l'd tell you.

10:19.595 --> 10:22.548
You and Brenda really crossed
the line this time.

10:25.141 --> 10:29.090
My advice is to just lay low
for a while.

10:29.270 --> 10:31.760
The less Jimbo sees
of you right now, the better.

10:33.648 --> 10:36.185
A few years ago,
my dad married this woman.

10:36.359 --> 10:40.023
She couldn't stand me.
We fought all the time.

10:40.404 --> 10:45.111
One day, she tells my dad
that l am persona non grata,

10:45.283 --> 10:48.698
as in, not welcome
in my own house.

10:50.370 --> 10:51.994
ls that what you're telling me here?

10:52.163 --> 10:54.570
At your house,
l'm persona non grata?

10:58.502 --> 11:00.577
Yeah, l guess so.

11:01.129 --> 11:03.666
Okay. l just wanted
to hear you say it.

11:18.518 --> 11:20.510
Can l have the butter, please?

11:20.728 --> 11:22.103
Sure.

11:30.194 --> 11:31.225
Salt, please.

11:47.542 --> 11:50.328
God, do our parents excel
at overkill or what?

11:50.502 --> 11:53.917
Are you kidding? All things considered,
l think you got off pretty easy.

11:54.089 --> 11:56.045
Okay, so l made a mistake.

11:56.215 --> 11:58.041
But how long is this
gonna keep on going on?

11:58.217 --> 11:59.710
How can l prove that l'm responsible

11:59.885 --> 12:01.960
when they don't let me make
any decisions on my own?

12:02.137 --> 12:04.212
Oh, yeah. Real responsible, Bren.

12:04.389 --> 12:08.006
Dad tells you not to go to Baja,
so you just zip down for the weekend.

12:08.183 --> 12:10.720
lt's not like we have
the strictest parents in the world.

12:11.269 --> 12:13.427
Well, l never thought
that l'd get caught.

12:13.646 --> 12:14.808
No, you just didn't think.

12:14.981 --> 12:18.183
Now l'm taking the heat for something
l thought was a lousy idea to start with.

12:18.358 --> 12:19.935
Brandon, l get the point.

12:20.110 --> 12:21.603
But what do l do now?

12:21.819 --> 12:23.941
l'll give you the same advice
l gave Dylan.

12:24.113 --> 12:25.820
Just lay low for a while.

12:32.203 --> 12:34.574
l never thought l'd be so happy
to come to school.

12:34.747 --> 12:37.284
Well, we can see each other
this afternoon at Kelly's.

12:37.457 --> 12:39.330
l thought you were grounded.

12:39.501 --> 12:41.659
Well, they are letting me go
to the wedding rehearsal

12:41.836 --> 12:43.958
and the dinner afterwards.
You could come too.

12:44.171 --> 12:46.044
Not much sense in me
going to the rehearsal

12:46.214 --> 12:47.542
if l'm not going to the wedding.

12:47.757 --> 12:48.788
What?

12:48.967 --> 12:51.006
Bren, your Dad's gonna be there.

12:51.218 --> 12:53.589
l mean, l know he's got a lot
of reasons to be mad at me,

12:53.762 --> 12:55.920
but l don't have to live
with his rules or his temper.

12:56.097 --> 12:57.970
l'm not going someplace
where l'm not wanted.

12:58.182 --> 13:00.174
Dylan, you have to go.
You were invited.

13:01.852 --> 13:04.520
l think we should keep
our distance for a little while.

13:06.272 --> 13:08.063
What do you mean?

13:08.858 --> 13:10.850
You and my father or you and me?

13:12.277 --> 13:13.854
Both.

13:14.446 --> 13:16.901
l can't believe this is happening.

13:17.531 --> 13:19.986
Look, if you're not going
to the wedding, then neither am l.

13:20.993 --> 13:23.364
Tell that to your father.

13:43.636 --> 13:45.794
Mom, what's going on here?

13:45.971 --> 13:48.543
We're making room for the tables.

13:48.723 --> 13:50.347
l thought the wedding was outside.

13:50.558 --> 13:54.222
We're starting with cocktails in here
and then moving out onto the veranda.

13:54.395 --> 13:56.766
Veranda?
l didn't know we had a veranda.

13:57.606 --> 13:59.230
That should just about do it.

13:59.399 --> 14:01.391
Fantastic, Jake.
Let me get you a cheque.

14:06.154 --> 14:08.478
So you were just gonna leave
without saying goodbye?

14:08.698 --> 14:11.153
l've got things to do.
l got to get out of here.

14:14.953 --> 14:16.612
What's the matter?

14:18.664 --> 14:21.699
l'm just gonna miss seeing you
around the house, that's all.

14:21.875 --> 14:24.033
With everything
that's been going on,

14:24.252 --> 14:26.576
you're the only person
l can really talk to.

14:26.796 --> 14:28.954
Hey, just because l'm not working
on your mom's house

14:29.131 --> 14:31.703
doesn't mean l'm gonna stop
being your friend.

14:31.883 --> 14:34.290
ls that all l am? Just your friend?

14:37.596 --> 14:39.884
Because the other night,
we were more than just friends.

14:41.058 --> 14:43.014
Hey, let's...

14:45.561 --> 14:48.016
...just see what happens, okay?

14:48.814 --> 14:51.185
l think we already have.

14:53.860 --> 14:54.891
Kelly.

14:55.069 --> 14:57.274
Jake, l want you to go with me
to my mom's wedding.

14:57.488 --> 14:59.065
l don't think so.

14:59.406 --> 15:00.437
Why not?

15:01.157 --> 15:02.319
You see, l'm the last person

15:02.492 --> 15:04.484
that you should be
bringing home to Mom.

15:07.496 --> 15:09.322
Please don't say that.

15:11.707 --> 15:13.746
Thanks, Jake. You're a lifesaver.

15:13.918 --> 15:16.455
Anytime. Bye, ladies.

15:16.628 --> 15:18.419
Bye, Jake.

15:19.005 --> 15:20.167
See you, Jake.

15:34.559 --> 15:36.598
So l asked Jake to go to the wedding
with me today

15:36.769 --> 15:38.393
and he just blew me off.

15:38.563 --> 15:40.851
Don't you realise that Jake
is just a fantasy for you?

15:41.023 --> 15:42.682
That's probably
why you like him so much.

15:42.858 --> 15:46.605
Now the bride will follow
and join the groom up here with me.

15:46.778 --> 15:48.319
Thank you for your support.

15:48.529 --> 15:50.734
Kelly, l was just being realistic.

15:50.906 --> 15:52.530
What's wrong?

15:52.699 --> 15:54.607
l ask Jake to the wedding.
He turns me down.

15:54.784 --> 15:56.740
l am totally devastated.
Now Brenda's telling me

15:56.911 --> 15:58.903
l'm a fool for thinking
there was something there.

15:59.121 --> 16:00.614
Kelly, look, l'm sorry.

16:00.789 --> 16:02.330
lt's just that today, Dylan told me

16:02.499 --> 16:03.992
he's not going to the wedding either.

16:04.167 --> 16:07.202
- Why not?
- Because my father will be there.

16:07.419 --> 16:09.494
Now, l'm just going to ask you
to join hands

16:09.671 --> 16:11.497
and repeat your vows after me.

16:11.673 --> 16:13.878
l think we're both familiar
with this routine.

16:15.509 --> 16:17.631
l mean, honestly,
with the way things are going,

16:17.803 --> 16:20.210
l don't see how Dylan and l
are gonna make it through this.

16:20.388 --> 16:22.712
Dylan McKay.
That's all we ever talk about.

16:22.890 --> 16:24.549
Did it ever occur to you
that other people

16:24.725 --> 16:26.468
have relationships
that they take seriously?

16:26.685 --> 16:29.009
Girls, can we please have
one rehearsal here?

16:29.229 --> 16:31.434
How can you compare
your problems with Jake,

16:31.606 --> 16:33.811
who you barely even know,
to my problems with Dylan?

16:33.983 --> 16:36.141
l mean, you're not even up there
with Donna and David.

16:36.318 --> 16:37.811
What's that supposed to mean?

16:38.028 --> 16:40.648
That means that Brenda is being
a self-centred little bitch.

16:40.863 --> 16:41.894
Kelly.

16:42.072 --> 16:43.400
l think l better go home.

16:43.574 --> 16:44.605
Brenda, wait.

16:44.783 --> 16:46.858
Kelly, what is wrong?

16:47.535 --> 16:49.740
l have a life too, you know, Mom.
l have feelings.

16:49.912 --> 16:52.449
Nobody here pays any attention
to them but they're there.

16:52.664 --> 16:54.620
You think it's too late to elope?

16:54.833 --> 16:57.157
Kelly, can't we talk about this later?

16:58.502 --> 17:00.541
We don't have to talk about it at all.

17:00.754 --> 17:01.785
You guys, come quick.

17:01.964 --> 17:04.169
- What?
- lt's raining in the living room.

17:04.382 --> 17:06.374
- What?
- A pipe must have burst or something.

17:06.592 --> 17:07.705
There's water everywhere.

17:07.926 --> 17:09.883
Oh, my God.

17:10.054 --> 17:11.215
What are they gonna do now?

17:11.722 --> 17:14.212
The living room is totally flooded.
lt's a wreck.

17:14.432 --> 17:16.756
And the water has to be off
for at least a couple of days

17:16.934 --> 17:19.009
in order for the plumbers
to pull out the tree roots

17:19.185 --> 17:21.308
or whatever disgusting things
clogged the pipes.

17:21.521 --> 17:22.931
Man, your mom
must be freaking out.

17:23.106 --> 17:25.145
She is. She's called every hotel.

17:25.316 --> 17:27.189
No one can throw a wedding
on one day's notice.

17:27.358 --> 17:30.027
lf they do, you use their food.
Mel already paid for the caterer.

17:30.237 --> 17:32.063
And my dad hates
to pay for things twice.

17:32.572 --> 17:34.896
Well, l'd say you guys could have
the wedding at my house,

17:35.074 --> 17:37.398
but since my parents are talking
about getting a divorce,

17:37.576 --> 17:39.153
it's probably not the best time.

17:39.327 --> 17:41.283
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, Andrea.

17:41.496 --> 17:43.737
Hi. Kelly, l've been trying
to call you all morning.

17:43.914 --> 17:44.945
Why, what's up?

17:45.124 --> 17:47.792
Look what my mom had stuffed
in her purse for the last two weeks.

17:48.001 --> 17:50.954
lt came to the house
and she totally forgot to give it to me.

17:51.170 --> 17:53.292
We were wondering
why we hadn't heard from you.

17:53.839 --> 17:56.294
l thought l wasn't invited.

17:57.092 --> 18:00.590
Andrea. Did you really think
we'd leave you out?

18:00.970 --> 18:02.084
l...

18:02.930 --> 18:07.258
No, l didn't think so.
But l-- l wasn't sure.

18:07.475 --> 18:08.755
Well, don't get too misted up.

18:08.935 --> 18:10.808
The way things are,
there may not be a wedding.

18:11.020 --> 18:12.561
Why? What happened?

18:12.729 --> 18:15.053
- lt's a long story.
- Wait a minute, l got an idea.

18:15.231 --> 18:17.768
Why don't l ask my mom
if we can have it at our house?

18:17.984 --> 18:20.023
- Seriously?
- You think she'd go for it?

18:20.236 --> 18:22.643
Why not? She loves parties.

18:22.821 --> 18:24.480
She loves having people
over to the house.

18:24.697 --> 18:26.653
You said we'd do what?

18:26.824 --> 18:30.523
l didn't say anything.
l merely said l would ask.

18:30.702 --> 18:32.445
Obviously the answer is no.

18:32.621 --> 18:35.076
How can we have a wedding here?
The house isn't big enough.

18:35.248 --> 18:36.445
Honey, your father's right.

18:36.624 --> 18:39.328
lt's very thoughtful. lt's not
that we don't want to be hospitable.

18:39.543 --> 18:42.745
lt's no problem.
l'll just tell Kelly the answer is no.

18:43.463 --> 18:45.170
l'll get it.

18:47.925 --> 18:49.466
Hello.

18:49.634 --> 18:51.258
Oh, hi, Jackie.

18:52.428 --> 18:55.298
Oh, she did? l did?

18:55.806 --> 18:59.388
Well, l-- l mean, well,
of course we've talked it over and--

19:00.435 --> 19:04.681
No. No, no, please,
Jackie, that's what we've decided.

19:04.855 --> 19:06.265
We'd love to have the wedding here.

19:07.899 --> 19:11.267
No problem. We'll discuss all that
when you come over.

19:11.485 --> 19:14.568
We'll see you soon. Bye.

19:15.906 --> 19:17.364
Honey, how could you?

19:18.658 --> 19:21.444
Somehow, Jackie
got the idea from Kelly

19:21.619 --> 19:24.239
that we'd offered
to have the wedding here.

19:24.413 --> 19:27.579
l mean, l just couldn't say no.

19:42.302 --> 19:44.377
How many more chairs are there?

19:44.554 --> 19:46.759
About 5000.

19:47.098 --> 19:49.339
l thought Jackie said
this was gonna be a small wedding.

19:49.516 --> 19:53.382
Well, l guess in Beverly Hills,
''small'' is a relative term.

19:53.561 --> 19:54.971
l can't thank you enough.

19:55.146 --> 19:58.312
The way you have extended yourselves
is just something that l'll never forget.

19:58.482 --> 20:00.308
Well, when l heard
what happened...

20:00.484 --> 20:01.563
You're such a doll.

20:01.776 --> 20:03.851
- Both of you.
- lt's nothing.

20:04.862 --> 20:06.770
Oh, which way to the kitchen?

20:06.947 --> 20:08.191
- l'll show you.
- No, no, no.

20:08.407 --> 20:10.315
Let me do it.
l don't want you to lift a finger.

20:10.492 --> 20:11.820
Right this way.

20:13.744 --> 20:14.775
Smile.

20:14.954 --> 20:16.910
l'm smiling.

20:19.916 --> 20:22.620
This better be a long
and happy marriage. l'm beat.

20:22.793 --> 20:24.785
l'm just not used to manual labour,
Steve.

20:24.962 --> 20:28.081
Yeah. Well, where's that guy Jake
when you need him?

20:33.177 --> 20:34.920
Brandon, have you seen Brenda?

20:35.095 --> 20:36.292
l think she's in bed.

20:36.471 --> 20:38.262
Still?

20:44.644 --> 20:46.517
Don't you think it's time
you got out of bed?

20:47.021 --> 20:48.977
l'm not in a partying mood, Mom.

20:49.815 --> 20:53.858
Honey, l know you're upset.
Staying in bed all day isn't gonna help.

20:54.069 --> 20:55.562
You mean l'm allowed
to leave my room?

20:56.529 --> 20:59.979
Look, your father is still very upset
about what happened and so am l.

21:00.157 --> 21:03.323
But there does come a point
where we'll all just have to get over it.

21:03.535 --> 21:06.321
That's easy for you to say.
What am l supposed to do?

21:06.496 --> 21:08.488
Dad won't even let Dylan
in the house.

21:09.498 --> 21:11.454
Well, your father thinks

21:11.625 --> 21:13.498
that the two of you
need to give it some space.

21:14.794 --> 21:17.996
ls he the only one
who makes decisions in this family?

21:18.172 --> 21:20.247
Don't you have a say
on what goes on around here?

21:20.757 --> 21:21.788
Look.

21:21.966 --> 21:24.503
You know l have always stood
by you two in the past.

21:24.677 --> 21:26.918
But l'm afraid l have to agree
with your father on this.

21:27.137 --> 21:28.595
l love him, Mom.

21:28.764 --> 21:30.590
Honey, give it some time.

21:30.807 --> 21:33.095
Things like this have a way
of working themselves out.

21:34.643 --> 21:36.884
- He's not coming to the wedding.
- Why not?

21:37.062 --> 21:38.555
After the way Dad screamed at him,

21:38.772 --> 21:41.309
l doubt he'll ever walk
through our front door again.

21:41.482 --> 21:43.604
He has his pride too, you know.

21:43.776 --> 21:45.602
l know.

21:45.819 --> 21:47.610
lsn't there anything that you can do?

21:49.947 --> 21:51.939
l saw Penn & Teller do this.
lt's really easy.

21:52.116 --> 21:54.986
Pop the champagne, pour it
into the top glass, it fills all the others.

21:55.160 --> 21:57.697
- All right, let's do it.
- Let's not and say we did.

21:57.912 --> 21:59.820
Hi, Mom.

22:00.206 --> 22:02.364
We were just unpacking
the champagne glasses.

22:02.583 --> 22:04.160
So l see.

22:04.334 --> 22:06.622
Brandon, could you run
a little errand for me?

22:06.836 --> 22:07.950
Sure. What do you need?

22:08.171 --> 22:09.415
l need to have this delivered.

22:13.258 --> 22:15.214
- Okay.
- Thanks.

22:22.724 --> 22:23.886
- What's this?
- l don't know.

22:24.059 --> 22:26.514
l'm just a messenger.
Open it.

22:34.025 --> 22:35.602
Dear Dylan,

22:35.818 --> 22:38.486
Sometimes, even when people care
for each other,

22:38.654 --> 22:40.895
things have a way
of getting out of hand.

22:41.072 --> 22:43.644
l think this is one of those times.

22:43.825 --> 22:47.442
l know your pride is very important
to you and it should be.

22:47.619 --> 22:51.615
But l'm asking you with all my heart
to put those feelings aside

22:51.789 --> 22:55.371
and find it within yourself
to take the first step.

22:55.542 --> 22:56.786
l'll do everything l can

22:56.960 --> 23:00.542
to make the path
back to our front door a little easier.

23:00.713 --> 23:03.084
Please, do this for Brenda.

23:03.257 --> 23:04.585
And for me.

23:04.758 --> 23:08.090
With love, Cindy Walsh.

23:21.230 --> 23:23.471
Oh, wow, look at this place,
it's a madhouse.

23:23.649 --> 23:24.929
Well, at least it's dry.

23:25.108 --> 23:27.313
Where have you guys been
while we're busting our butts?

23:27.485 --> 23:28.564
Getting beautiful.

23:28.736 --> 23:29.980
Priorities, Steve.

23:30.154 --> 23:31.813
So where are we supposed
to get dressed?

23:31.989 --> 23:34.111
Brenda's room, l guess.

23:34.282 --> 23:36.606
Don, stay here, l'm gonna go up
and talk to her first.

23:36.784 --> 23:38.325
Okay.

23:41.705 --> 23:43.697
l smell trouble.

23:45.124 --> 23:46.867
Come in.

23:48.794 --> 23:50.371
Hi.

23:51.463 --> 23:52.743
Hi.

23:54.799 --> 23:56.423
Bren, l'm really sorry.

23:57.718 --> 24:01.133
No, l'm sorry.
l was being really selfish.

24:01.888 --> 24:05.256
l just feel so stupid.
l mean, l called you a bitch

24:05.432 --> 24:07.424
and now my mom is getting married
at your house.

24:07.601 --> 24:09.640
Yeah, it's all kind of
ridiculous, isn't it?

24:09.811 --> 24:11.886
lt's really embarrassing.

24:12.480 --> 24:14.223
Come here.

24:17.067 --> 24:19.355
He really meant something
to me, Bren.

24:19.527 --> 24:21.435
l know we didn't know
each other for that long

24:21.612 --> 24:25.478
but l, like, developed all these feelings
like l've never had before.

24:25.657 --> 24:27.032
And to be rejected like that

24:27.200 --> 24:30.402
when my mom's getting married
and everything, it just really hurt.

24:30.912 --> 24:33.034
Look, l'm sorry
l was so self-centred.

24:33.205 --> 24:34.948
l didn't mean to make
my problems with Dylan

24:35.123 --> 24:36.866
seem bigger than your problems
with Jake.

24:37.458 --> 24:38.868
They probably are.

24:39.085 --> 24:40.709
No, they're not.

24:40.920 --> 24:44.086
- Come on, let's get dressed.
- Wait a minute, where's Donna?

24:44.256 --> 24:46.331
She's downstairs waiting
for the smoke to clear.

24:46.508 --> 24:48.796
Well, l'll go get her.

24:52.971 --> 24:54.714
- Hi.
- Hi.

24:55.348 --> 24:57.636
- Dylan.
- Hi, Bren.

24:58.893 --> 25:00.007
What are you doing here?

25:01.144 --> 25:03.100
Taking the first step.

25:03.271 --> 25:05.512
He's up in the bedroom. Go on up.

25:11.653 --> 25:13.479
l love you, Mom.

25:18.825 --> 25:21.659
--won't show up in the box score,
but Samuel with a big assist

25:21.870 --> 25:24.158
by hitting behind Davis
and moving him over to third.

25:24.330 --> 25:26.737
Scioscia with a chance to win it.

25:26.915 --> 25:27.946
Dylan.

25:28.166 --> 25:29.541
ls this a bad time?

25:30.043 --> 25:31.620
No, l'm just watching the game.

25:31.836 --> 25:33.744
--element of surprise.

25:33.921 --> 25:35.249
Come on in.

25:38.174 --> 25:41.340
lt's not just a matter of being sorry,
Dylan.

25:41.511 --> 25:45.045
At some point in life, you have to take
responsibility for your actions.

25:45.222 --> 25:47.130
That's what it means to be an adult.

25:47.349 --> 25:49.305
l'm well aware of that.
That's why l'm here.

25:49.475 --> 25:51.882
Still, don't you think
that you're being a little harsh?

25:53.312 --> 25:57.391
Actually, Dylan,
l think l've been pretty damn tolerant.

25:57.565 --> 25:59.058
From your bouts with alcohol

25:59.984 --> 26:02.142
and when Brenda was scared
she was pregnant,

26:02.319 --> 26:03.481
l've always kept an open mind

26:03.653 --> 26:05.941
because l knew how much
my daughter cared for you.

26:06.156 --> 26:08.990
But at some point,
l just have to draw the line.

26:10.868 --> 26:13.192
You've known me for a while now,
Mr. Walsh.

26:13.370 --> 26:15.611
Am l such a bad person?

26:15.830 --> 26:19.364
Dylan, you broke a trust.

26:19.541 --> 26:22.457
And until l feel that trust is repaired...

26:22.627 --> 26:24.286
You can come to the wedding today,

26:24.462 --> 26:27.213
but after that,
l don't want you seeing Brenda.

26:27.423 --> 26:30.707
Period, final, the end.

26:30.884 --> 26:33.884
Well, then, l guess
there's nothing more to say.

26:48.773 --> 26:49.887
Dylan, where are you going?

26:50.066 --> 26:52.141
Home, to get dressed.

26:52.318 --> 26:55.733
l am so happy.
Whatever you said, thank you.

26:56.488 --> 26:58.314
See you later.

27:12.209 --> 27:15.577
When l get married, l'm going to wear
a beautiful antique beaded gown.

27:15.754 --> 27:18.161
Those cost a fortune,
if you can find them.

27:18.339 --> 27:20.082
Kelly, this is a fantasy.
Don't interrupt.

27:21.133 --> 27:23.172
And Dylan, or whoever it is,

27:23.343 --> 27:24.920
will be wearing a black tux with tails.

27:25.095 --> 27:27.715
And there'll be a wonderful flutist
playing a magic flute.

27:27.930 --> 27:29.258
That's so romantic.

27:29.431 --> 27:30.924
What kind of band
are you gonna have?

27:31.141 --> 27:32.884
l don't even know if l'll have a band.

27:33.101 --> 27:34.263
You better make up your mind.

27:34.436 --> 27:36.095
Decent ones are booked
years in advance.

27:36.312 --> 27:38.802
Donna, what kind of wedding
are you gonna have?

27:38.981 --> 27:41.732
l don't know. Maybe something
traditional in a church.

27:41.900 --> 27:43.228
Maybe l'll do something wild,

27:43.401 --> 27:45.393
like that couple who got married
bungee jumping.

27:45.611 --> 27:47.686
- Bungee jumping?
- Yeah, it's totally perfect.

27:48.113 --> 27:49.393
You know, jump off the cliff

27:49.573 --> 27:51.897
with the long rubber cord
attached to you?

27:52.075 --> 27:54.565
lt's totally death-defying,
just like marriage.

27:54.785 --> 27:58.034
Oh, and that's when you say,
''l do...''

27:59.081 --> 28:01.867
l'll be going to check
on the bride now.

28:06.670 --> 28:08.496
Mom.

28:10.882 --> 28:14.464
What's the matter?
Are these tears of happiness?

28:14.635 --> 28:16.959
Tears of terror.

28:17.846 --> 28:19.090
Well, what's the big deal?

28:19.264 --> 28:22.383
You've already done this three times.
This should be a piece of cake.

28:22.558 --> 28:24.135
That's the whole point.

28:24.351 --> 28:25.975
Three times.

28:26.144 --> 28:28.716
What makes me think
this one's gonna be any different?

28:30.064 --> 28:32.020
You love him, don't you?

28:32.191 --> 28:33.649
Of course l do.

28:33.859 --> 28:36.349
l loved them all.

28:37.320 --> 28:38.564
Maybe this is silly.

28:38.738 --> 28:42.402
Maybe we should just live together
like Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell.

28:42.616 --> 28:45.153
They never saw any reason
to get married and they're gorgeous.

28:45.326 --> 28:46.606
Mother.

28:47.578 --> 28:48.988
Do you like him, Kel?

28:50.789 --> 28:53.160
l mean, do you really like him?

28:53.708 --> 28:56.328
Because l just want you to know

28:56.502 --> 29:00.166
that there is nobody more important
in my life than you.

29:03.883 --> 29:06.124
Yeah, l really like him.

29:06.344 --> 29:09.628
Oh, God, l'm so glad
to hear you say that.

29:10.847 --> 29:14.131
Maybe you're forgetting
one very important thing here.

29:14.308 --> 29:15.552
What's that?

29:15.726 --> 29:19.094
You're getting married
because Mel asked you.

29:19.271 --> 29:21.097
Maybe he knows what he's doing.

29:24.692 --> 29:26.233
Yeah.

29:27.694 --> 29:29.816
Maybe he does.

29:37.577 --> 29:39.450
Oh, boy.

29:39.829 --> 29:43.327
l better do this soon
before l pop out of this thing.

29:43.791 --> 29:45.949
Okay.

29:50.338 --> 29:51.962
Come on.

29:52.131 --> 29:54.538
Let's get married.

29:56.259 --> 29:58.381
Ready to get married?

30:04.933 --> 30:07.886
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here today

30:08.060 --> 30:10.930
to celebrate the blessed union
of two people

30:11.104 --> 30:13.676
who are very special to all assembled.

30:13.898 --> 30:17.681
We all know of their special
commitment to one another

30:17.902 --> 30:22.029
and the obstacles they faced,
yet never let stand in their way.

30:22.238 --> 30:26.365
Of their singular devotion that time
and time again has been tested,

30:26.575 --> 30:31.485
yet remains firmly rooted
in the fertile soil of their love.

30:31.663 --> 30:34.912
lt is my honour
to unite this special couple

30:35.082 --> 30:37.453
in holy matrimony.

30:38.460 --> 30:40.368
Do you, Dylan McKay,

30:40.545 --> 30:43.711
take Brenda Walsh to be
your lawfully wedded wife?

30:43.881 --> 30:46.585
To have and to hold
from this day forward,

30:46.758 --> 30:49.877
in sickness and health,
for richer, for poorer,

30:50.053 --> 30:51.463
till death do you part?

30:52.930 --> 30:54.210
l do.

30:54.431 --> 30:55.545
Do you, Brenda Walsh,

30:55.724 --> 30:58.640
take Dylan McKay to be
your lawfully wedded husband?

30:58.852 --> 31:01.389
To have and to hold
from this day forward,

31:01.562 --> 31:04.846
in sickness and health,
for richer, for poorer,

31:05.065 --> 31:07.223
till death do you part?

31:07.567 --> 31:08.895
l do.

31:09.485 --> 31:12.319
l now pronounce you
husband and wife.

31:12.529 --> 31:13.987
You may kiss the bride.

31:35.756 --> 31:36.953
Congratulations, Mother.

31:37.133 --> 31:38.674
Thank you, sweetheart.

31:43.680 --> 31:45.802
Let's party.

31:59.818 --> 32:02.355
Oh, no, dear, it's West Beverly High.

32:02.528 --> 32:05.065
Oh, okay.

32:16.873 --> 32:18.829
Well, looks like they finally did it.

32:19.000 --> 32:21.870
Yep, l can hardly believe it.

32:22.044 --> 32:24.534
l bet it'll be nice
to have a dad around.

32:24.713 --> 32:26.669
Even if it is David Silver's.

32:26.840 --> 32:28.796
Easy for you to say.

32:28.966 --> 32:32.381
So how are things going
with that guy, Joke?

32:32.553 --> 32:35.423
- Jake.
- Jake, right.

32:36.514 --> 32:40.510
Well, obviously, nothing's going on
or he'd be here right now.

32:41.143 --> 32:42.850
l guess that makes you happy,
doesn't it?

32:43.019 --> 32:44.845
No, no, it doesn't.

32:45.021 --> 32:46.349
Seeing you two the other night

32:46.522 --> 32:48.893
made me realise
something very important.

32:49.066 --> 32:50.524
What's that?

32:50.692 --> 32:52.980
That we're not getting back together.

32:54.153 --> 32:56.145
Probably not.

32:56.697 --> 32:58.653
But then, who would have thought

32:58.824 --> 33:00.982
my mother would be marrying
David's father?

33:02.410 --> 33:04.449
Life takes some weird turns.

33:04.620 --> 33:05.900
Yeah, it does.

33:06.997 --> 33:09.321
l guess l'm ready to take one.

33:11.918 --> 33:13.411
lt is over, Kelly.

33:14.545 --> 33:17.379
lt has been for a long time, Steve.

33:17.714 --> 33:19.919
Maybe you just didn't want to see it.

33:22.093 --> 33:23.421
This doesn't mean l'm gonna stop

33:23.594 --> 33:25.882
putting my two cents in
about whoever you go out with.

33:26.096 --> 33:28.254
l wouldn't expect anything less.

33:30.016 --> 33:33.466
Kelly, do you want to dance?

33:33.811 --> 33:35.008
Sure. Why not?

33:35.187 --> 33:37.179
Yeah, you guys go ahead.

33:38.481 --> 33:41.931
l think it's time l met up with some
of the new members of your family.

33:50.449 --> 33:52.275
Dylan, l'm really glad you came.

33:52.451 --> 33:54.988
Yeah, well, l'm not so sure
it was a good idea.

33:55.161 --> 33:56.240
Why?

33:56.412 --> 33:59.032
Because your dad
keeps glaring at me, Bren.

34:01.083 --> 34:04.367
Yeah, well, he's not the only one
who makes decisions in this family.

34:04.544 --> 34:07.034
To tell you the truth,
l don't really give a damn anymore.

34:07.755 --> 34:10.589
Dyl, why don't you just relax
and have a good time?

34:10.757 --> 34:12.748
Not after what went down
this morning.

34:12.967 --> 34:15.882
l tried to apologise, but all he could do
was dredge up the past.

34:16.053 --> 34:19.088
Like he was waiting for this to happen
so he could hit me with all of that.

34:19.681 --> 34:22.349
- What did he say?
- lt doesn't matter.

34:22.559 --> 34:24.467
l feel like an idiot.
l put my trust in the guy.

34:24.643 --> 34:26.885
l do one little thing wrong
and he totally shuts me out.

34:27.646 --> 34:29.103
Dylan, l'm sure he didn't mean it.

34:29.272 --> 34:31.228
Yeah, he meant it all right.

34:31.440 --> 34:34.809
You know, Bren, only one person's
ever made me feel that bad.

34:34.985 --> 34:36.525
He's in jail now.

34:42.491 --> 34:44.898
lt's so weird.
Last year at the Spring Fling,

34:45.077 --> 34:47.911
l had to win a contest
just to bag a dance with you.

34:48.079 --> 34:49.620
And now you're my sister.

34:49.789 --> 34:51.282
Stepsister.

34:51.456 --> 34:53.614
Well, close enough.

34:54.460 --> 34:56.949
Remember when you used to be
such a geek?

34:57.128 --> 34:58.503
Not.

34:58.671 --> 35:02.370
Come on, David.
But you've really changed.

35:02.549 --> 35:03.746
Kind of matured.

35:05.510 --> 35:07.301
- Really?
- Yeah.

35:07.804 --> 35:09.926
You've actually gotten kind of cool.

35:10.431 --> 35:13.597
Seriously, you really think l'm cool?

35:14.768 --> 35:17.851
So when do you think
l started to change?

35:18.938 --> 35:20.977
Don't press your luck.

35:21.481 --> 35:23.188
Okay.

35:29.405 --> 35:30.436
Do you mind?

35:30.947 --> 35:33.484
No, no. Go ahead.

35:35.451 --> 35:37.775
Jake, what are you doing here?

35:38.745 --> 35:39.859
After l left, l realised

35:40.038 --> 35:42.954
that dropping out of your life
is not gonna be that easy.

35:45.042 --> 35:47.746
You're a very dangerous girl, Kelly.

35:47.920 --> 35:49.959
Why am l dangerous?

35:51.089 --> 35:54.172
l don't think l should be feeling
what l'm feeling.

35:55.467 --> 35:56.629
l'm not a kid.

35:56.844 --> 35:58.551
No.

35:59.262 --> 36:00.921
And you're not an adult either.

36:04.975 --> 36:08.141
You're very, very bright.

36:10.104 --> 36:11.977
And extremely sewy.

36:12.148 --> 36:13.476
And l should probably be arrested

36:13.649 --> 36:15.688
for thinking
what l'm thinking right now.

36:17.402 --> 36:19.773
Oh, l won't call the cops.

36:21.113 --> 36:23.650
l have a few fantasies of my own.

36:23.824 --> 36:26.575
Tell me yours, l'll tell you mine.

36:28.619 --> 36:30.907
l'm not talking about fantasies.

36:34.249 --> 36:35.992
l'm here.

36:36.167 --> 36:38.075
And l'm real.

36:39.503 --> 36:42.373
And the truth is
you don't know anything about me.

36:42.547 --> 36:43.875
l think l do.

36:44.049 --> 36:46.669
Well, you know that l paint houses.

36:47.259 --> 36:49.334
Beyond that, you have
absolutely no idea

36:49.511 --> 36:51.633
what you're getting yourself into.

36:52.806 --> 36:54.762
l'm willing to take my chances.

36:55.808 --> 36:57.266
Brave girl.

36:58.060 --> 37:00.431
l just l feel so--

37:18.201 --> 37:21.236
Oh, come on. Kelly must have
talked to you about me.

37:21.412 --> 37:23.487
l went out with her for over a year.

37:23.664 --> 37:26.580
No. Excuse me.

37:27.792 --> 37:29.914
She talked to me.

37:31.962 --> 37:36.421
Well, let me tell you
some other things about myself.

37:37.050 --> 37:38.627
You know,
l just figured something out.

37:38.801 --> 37:40.923
lf four out of ten marriages
end in divorce,

37:41.095 --> 37:42.921
and Kelly's mom's
been divorced three times

37:43.096 --> 37:46.096
and David's dad's been divorced once,
then they've already beat the odds.

37:46.266 --> 37:49.848
They've been divorced four times.
This marriage is gonna last forever.

37:50.019 --> 37:52.889
l just don't know what l'd do
without your incredible little insights.

37:53.396 --> 37:56.349
l know. Kind of silly
l almost didn't make it here, huh?

37:56.524 --> 37:57.721
Real silly.

37:57.900 --> 38:00.141
There's this part of me
that doesn't feel like l belong

38:00.319 --> 38:03.485
even though l know it's not true.
l have great friends.

38:03.655 --> 38:06.323
Deep inside, l guess
l'm always questioning

38:06.490 --> 38:08.149
whether they really like me.

38:08.367 --> 38:09.611
Well, what do you think?

38:09.785 --> 38:11.195
l know they do.

38:11.870 --> 38:15.238
lt's just sometimes,
l feel so different.

38:15.748 --> 38:18.618
You are different.
You're Andrea Zuckerman.

38:18.792 --> 38:20.784
And there could never be
another Andrea Zuckerman.

38:20.961 --> 38:22.953
And that is why they like you.

38:25.131 --> 38:28.214
So you want to dance?

38:34.763 --> 38:37.716
You guys sneaking up
to the bedroom already?

38:37.891 --> 38:39.682
Yeah, that's right.
We just couldn't wait.

38:39.851 --> 38:42.056
We're just going upstairs to change.

38:42.228 --> 38:43.425
Congratulations, Jackie.

38:43.646 --> 38:44.677
Thank you, sweetheart.

38:44.855 --> 38:46.894
Congratulations, Mr. Silver.

38:47.065 --> 38:48.475
Donna, you can call me Mel.

38:49.650 --> 38:50.812
Okay, Mel.

38:51.819 --> 38:54.143
lt took me a long time to figure out
what to get you guys.

38:54.321 --> 38:57.440
Since l'm sure between the two of you,
you probably already have everything.

38:57.615 --> 38:59.939
But there's one thing l know
my dad doesn't have,

39:00.117 --> 39:02.156
and it's something
he could share with you, Jackie.

39:02.369 --> 39:04.076
What is it?

39:09.708 --> 39:10.822
David.

39:11.043 --> 39:13.331
You got Jackie a pair of earrings.
How sweet.

39:13.837 --> 39:17.584
No, no, no,
l got you both a pair of earrings.

39:17.757 --> 39:19.132
lt's one for each of you.

39:44.362 --> 39:46.603
What are you doing here, man?

39:46.780 --> 39:48.855
Who you drinking for?

39:49.032 --> 39:51.403
lf l remember right,
that wasn't one of your better habits.

39:51.617 --> 39:54.949
And dropping in and out
of people's lives isn't one of yours.

39:55.788 --> 39:56.819
Come on, Dylan.

39:57.414 --> 40:00.284
Give me a break, will you, Jake?
lt's Coke.

40:00.833 --> 40:01.947
What's with you, man?

40:02.168 --> 40:05.287
l'm tired of putting my trust in people
and have them slam the door.

40:05.796 --> 40:07.289
You've got the right idea, Jake.

40:07.505 --> 40:09.378
Keep moving.
Never make any serious attachments.

40:09.549 --> 40:10.663
Let me tell you something.

40:10.883 --> 40:12.127
lt's a rotten way to live.

40:12.301 --> 40:14.174
Yeah, well,
you look like you're doing okay.

40:14.344 --> 40:17.178
- That's the way it's supposed to look.
- Got Kelly fooled.

40:18.139 --> 40:19.514
Be careful, Jake.

40:19.724 --> 40:22.012
She's a young girl. Emotional.

40:22.184 --> 40:23.927
She feels something,
it's permanent record.

40:24.102 --> 40:26.722
Trust me, it doesn't feel good
to have that messed with.

40:26.896 --> 40:27.975
Kelly knows what's up.

40:28.147 --> 40:29.724
Oh, you told her your life history?

40:29.899 --> 40:32.021
Hey, don't worry about Kelly,
okay, Dylan?

40:32.234 --> 40:34.273
She's having a good time tonight.

40:34.903 --> 40:36.610
Okay.

40:49.498 --> 40:51.122
Dad.

40:51.583 --> 40:54.702
What did you say to Dylan?
l've never seen him so upset.

40:54.877 --> 40:58.327
Brenda, l just told him how l felt.

40:58.505 --> 41:01.458
But we are Dylan's only family
and you're shutting him out.

41:05.302 --> 41:07.093
Maybe l did overreact a bit.

41:07.304 --> 41:09.212
Then say something to him.

41:09.389 --> 41:11.713
l can't stand to see him
so miserable.

41:11.933 --> 41:13.474
Come on,
Mel and Jackie are leaving.

41:13.642 --> 41:15.634
lt's Rice-A-Roni time.

41:15.811 --> 41:17.008
l'll talk to him afterwards.

41:17.187 --> 41:21.136
Now, Dad.
He's standing outside by the bar.

41:21.899 --> 41:23.476
Okay.

41:30.156 --> 41:31.733
Dylan.

41:32.616 --> 41:34.691
l was just talking to Brenda.

41:34.868 --> 41:36.907
She told me how you're feeling.

41:37.078 --> 41:41.869
And l was beginning to realise
that maybe l've been a little unfair.

41:42.040 --> 41:44.744
You don't have to apologise to me.

41:44.918 --> 41:48.582
l let my temper get the better of me,
l'm sorry for that.

41:49.463 --> 41:51.122
You know how we all feel about you,
Dylan.

41:51.298 --> 41:52.495
l thought l did.

41:52.716 --> 41:56.048
l thought there was some special thing
going on between me and your family.

41:56.260 --> 41:58.964
So l trusted you. Like a father, man.

41:59.138 --> 42:01.758
Not just with my money
but with my feelings.

42:02.515 --> 42:05.135
Dylan, that trust is a two-way street.

42:05.309 --> 42:08.309
- l mean, imagine how we feel--
- l know how you feel!

42:08.479 --> 42:10.886
But at least when my dad was pissed
at me, he would hit me.

42:11.064 --> 42:13.139
l could look at the bruises
and know they'd go away.

42:13.316 --> 42:15.984
Come on, Jim. Take a shot.

42:16.193 --> 42:18.813
Let me know how you really feel.

42:21.114 --> 42:22.655
Yeah.

42:27.703 --> 42:30.193
Oh, that's it.
Now you need a drink, huh?

42:30.413 --> 42:33.283
What l don't need
is you telling me what to do.

42:34.958 --> 42:36.368
Then l suggest you go home.

42:36.585 --> 42:39.122
Yeah, you're damn straight l will.
And another thing.

42:39.295 --> 42:43.126
l want your hands off my money,
you got that?

43:18.953 --> 43:22.155
Dylan. Dylan, wait.

43:22.330 --> 43:24.369
- Did he apologise?
- Not exactly.

43:24.540 --> 43:26.698
- Well, what did he say?
- lt's my fault, all right?

43:27.376 --> 43:30.874
l just got too close to all of you.
l won't make that mistake again.

43:32.005 --> 43:33.119
Dylan, wait.

43:34.549 --> 43:35.924
Brenda, let him go.

43:36.091 --> 43:37.288
l don't want to let him go.

43:37.509 --> 43:39.750
You are not to see him anymore.

43:40.261 --> 43:41.589
What did you say to him?

43:42.305 --> 43:48.794
