00:02.461 --> 00:05.047
[Upbeat music]

00:07.424 --> 00:10.427
[Suspenseful music]

00:12.429 --> 00:15.181
[Bruce] With god, all
things are possible,

00:15.182 --> 00:18.184
Matthew 19:26.

00:18.185 --> 00:20.978
Over the years, I've shared
that verse more times

00:20.979 --> 00:22.897
than I could ever count.

00:22.898 --> 00:26.192
But now, for the first
time, I know it's true.

00:26.193 --> 00:27.818
You see, six months ago,

00:27.819 --> 00:31.239
something impossible
did happen down there.

00:31.240 --> 00:32.865
One instant of time,

00:32.866 --> 00:36.202
millions of people just
disappeared without a trace,

00:36.203 --> 00:38.829
poof, gone just like that.

00:38.830 --> 00:41.290
Well, if that's not impossible,

00:41.291 --> 00:42.626
then I don't know what is.

00:43.544 --> 00:45.545
- As cleanup efforts
continue in the aftermath of

00:45.546 --> 00:48.589
the vanishings, single
most catastrophic event

00:48.590 --> 00:51.842
in all of human history
and security forces work

00:51.843 --> 00:53.886
to stem worldwide violence,

00:53.887 --> 00:56.639
there is still more
questions than answers.

00:56.640 --> 00:59.183
[Bruce] Today, people
still say the vanishings

00:59.184 --> 01:02.645
came without a warning or
any kind of explanation,

01:02.646 --> 01:04.522
but that's just not true.

01:04.522 --> 01:07.483
There were plenty of
warnings and explanations,

01:07.484 --> 01:10.444
but there were also
plenty of closed minds.

01:10.445 --> 01:12.989
While the president insists
that the greatest threat

01:12.990 --> 01:16.242
to our country is those clinging
to the conspiracy theory,

01:16.243 --> 01:19.579
that somehow god had something
to do with the vanishings.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.664
[Bruce] And we all
know that a closed mind

01:21.665 --> 01:24.083
is not an easy thing to pry open.

01:24.084 --> 01:27.003
But even after watching all
those people just vanish

01:27.004 --> 01:28.379
into thin air,

01:28.380 --> 01:30.756
most people still had
no interest in the fact

01:30.757 --> 01:34.343
that all of it was written
down thousands of years ago

01:34.344 --> 01:37.346
in that dusty old book on the shelf.

01:37.347 --> 01:40.808
It's been six months since
tens of millions of people

01:40.809 --> 01:42.476
suddenly disappeared.

01:42.477 --> 01:44.437
And as far as we're concerned,

01:44.438 --> 01:46.397
none of them have been seen since.

01:46.398 --> 01:48.524
So they hid from the truth, mostly,

01:48.525 --> 01:50.901
dreaming of any answer
they could think of,

01:50.902 --> 01:54.989
as long as it didn't involve
god, of course, solar flares,

01:54.990 --> 01:57.200
secret weapons, little green men.

01:58.493 --> 02:01.245
Nothing was too crazy for a
world determined not to see

02:01.246 --> 02:02.496
the truth.

02:02.497 --> 02:04.915
And of course, one thing
you can always count on

02:04.916 --> 02:06.293
when disaster strikes,

02:07.544 --> 02:10.003
they're those whose first
thought is how to seize

02:10.005 --> 02:11.006
the opportunity.

02:11.965 --> 02:14.592
For Jonathan stonagal, well,
he seemed to have his plan

02:14.593 --> 02:16.260
in place before those empty clothes

02:16.261 --> 02:18.429
that even hit the ground.

02:18.430 --> 02:20.474
- [Ed] Now you understand, Mr. Stonagal,

02:21.350 --> 02:22.975
if it were up to me,

02:22.976 --> 02:25.103
I wouldn't be questioning any of this.

02:26.271 --> 02:29.650
Hmm, it is up to you, ed,

02:31.026 --> 02:32.026
all of it.

02:32.944 --> 02:34.570
The board can't interfere
with what I'm doing

02:34.571 --> 02:36.281
without unanimous consent.

02:38.367 --> 02:40.159
You're not here to tell me
that you're turning your back

02:40.160 --> 02:41.328
on me now, are you, ed?

02:42.913 --> 02:46.457
I've turned hundreds into thousands,

02:46.458 --> 02:49.794
thousands into millions,
millions into billions.

02:49.795 --> 02:53.005
And still the bean counters
think that they know

02:53.006 --> 02:54.674
what's best.

02:54.675 --> 02:57.760
We're losing millions
of dollars every day now,

02:57.761 --> 03:02.766
with all of your new projects
and investments in Eden,

03:03.475 --> 03:06.143
the biggest social media
platform in history,

03:06.144 --> 03:09.563
buying up every media company
you get your hands on.

03:09.564 --> 03:11.816
You don't need to be
the only source of news

03:11.817 --> 03:13.526
and information.

03:13.527 --> 03:18.532
And now $400 million to build
a temple in the middle east.

03:19.199 --> 03:20.242
It's a nice temple.

03:21.576 --> 03:23.787
[Announcer] Sir, your
two o'clock is here.

03:24.955 --> 03:27.665
- I suggest you go and give
serious thought as to what side

03:27.666 --> 03:29.501
of the table you wanna be sitting on.

03:30.711 --> 03:34.548
Something big is coming. Trust me.

03:36.466 --> 03:38.677
You wanna make sure
you're on the right team.

03:41.763 --> 03:43.889
- As people grapple with our new reality,

03:43.890 --> 03:46.183
trying to accept the fact
that they may never see those

03:46.184 --> 03:47.977
missing loved ones again.

03:47.978 --> 03:50.020
Faith in our leaders is gone,

03:50.021 --> 03:53.774
and frustration and anger
is at an all—time high.

03:53.775 --> 03:56.318
Not only have violent
crimes risen dramatically,

03:56.319 --> 03:59.029
but suicides are soaring outta control.

03:59.030 --> 04:01.574
But according to mental health experts,

04:01.575 --> 04:03.909
there is an explanation
to what's going on.

04:03.910 --> 04:05.703
We're gonna get into that with one of them

04:05.704 --> 04:07.663
right after the break.

04:07.664 --> 04:09.583
[TV continues in background]

04:15.088 --> 04:17.255
- [Bruce] I have to admit,
I was never a big fan

04:17.257 --> 04:18.341
of rayford Steele.

04:19.634 --> 04:21.969
His wife, Irene, had
tried for years to get him

04:21.970 --> 04:23.971
to join us at new hope,

04:23.972 --> 04:26.224
but I guess church just wasn't his thing.

04:27.309 --> 04:29.518
When she did manage to drag him there,

04:29.519 --> 04:31.687
he'd either read the
sports news on his phone

04:31.688 --> 04:34.148
or grab a quick nap thinking
everyone would believe

04:34.149 --> 04:35.108
he's praying.

04:35.109 --> 04:37.694
[Suspenseful music]

04:40.197 --> 04:44.074
Irene had warned him about the
rapture over and over again,

04:44.075 --> 04:46.827
or at least that's how it seemed to him.

04:46.828 --> 04:48.788
[Pilot] The jfk control.
This is pen seven.

04:48.789 --> 04:51.165
We have an emergency. I repeat.

04:51.166 --> 04:53.542
We have an emergency.

04:53.543 --> 04:57.004
Jfk control, listen to
me, we've lost passengers.

04:57.005 --> 05:00.425
People literally disappeared
from the plane at 30,000 feet.

05:04.012 --> 05:05.721
- [Bruce] So when half
the passengers on his

05:05.722 --> 05:08.474
trans—atlantic flight vanished that night,

05:08.475 --> 05:10.310
he knew right away what had happened.

05:11.311 --> 05:14.605
He may not have fully
understood what it meant,

05:14.606 --> 05:17.651
but Irene had told him what
would happen, and it did.

05:40.173 --> 05:43.009
And so at least ray
knew one thing for sure.

05:44.219 --> 05:47.680
He desperately wanted to
believe that Irene was right.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.891
- I miss you and ramey so much.

05:52.435 --> 05:53.435
It's been hard.

05:55.355 --> 05:59.359
Just keep thinking about
the things I said and did,

06:02.946 --> 06:04.614
whether you know how much I love you.

06:07.409 --> 06:09.369
I just wish I could see you one more time,

06:11.204 --> 06:12.414
but I know I can't.

06:15.250 --> 06:17.002
Yeah, I know I can't.

06:21.882 --> 06:23.716
The world's obsession
with the vanishings

06:23.717 --> 06:24.884
is still in full force.

06:24.885 --> 06:28.846
And since we have no answers
from our supposed leaders,

06:28.847 --> 06:30.639
that's not really a surprise.

06:30.640 --> 06:33.058
And while the immediate panic
and acute terror may have

06:33.059 --> 06:36.520
passed, I don't think anyone
can say that the world is not

06:36.521 --> 06:38.981
a completely different place now.

06:38.982 --> 06:41.775
In the past six months,
we've seen a dramatic,

06:41.776 --> 06:44.987
even shocking increase
in virtually every metric

06:44.988 --> 06:46.697
of human depravity.

06:46.698 --> 06:48.866
Compared to the same time last year,

06:48.867 --> 06:52.202
murders are up by more than 300%

06:52.203 --> 06:55.915
and suicides are up nearly 1000%.

06:55.916 --> 06:58.334
Violent crime, assault, rape, robbery,

06:58.335 --> 07:02.338
vandalism, looting, rioting,
they're all shattering records.

07:02.339 --> 07:04.256
And mental health experts
are telling us that

07:04.257 --> 07:06.216
the worst is yet to come.

07:06.217 --> 07:08.427
I have with me tonight, Dr. Ruby Kincaid,

07:08.428 --> 07:10.930
who is leading the
multinational investigation

07:10.931 --> 07:14.683
into what many are now
calling a pandemic of evil.

07:14.684 --> 07:17.019
Doctor, thank you so much for
being here with us tonight.

07:17.020 --> 07:19.063
So, I guess we should just
get right to the heart of

07:19.064 --> 07:20.732
the matter, what's going on?

07:21.733 --> 07:23.692
In the case of the vanishings,

07:23.693 --> 07:27.613
there's simply no historical
knowledge to draw on.

07:27.614 --> 07:30.908
So people are triggered
into a prolonged fight

07:30.909 --> 07:33.035
or flight reaction.

07:33.036 --> 07:38.041
There is anger, fear,
mistrust, retaliation.

07:38.541 --> 07:43.004
Those are powerful emotions,
and they need an outlet.

07:44.589 --> 07:47.591
- So do you think world
leaders in our own government

07:47.592 --> 07:50.469
as well, should be doing
a betterjob at helping us

07:50.470 --> 07:52.554
understand exactly what's happening?

07:52.555 --> 07:55.599
I mean, I know we have no
idea where those people went,

07:55.600 --> 07:58.268
but telling everyone to stay at home,

07:58.269 --> 07:59.770
stop asking so many questions.

07:59.771 --> 08:02.648
I mean, that can't likely be helping.

08:02.649 --> 08:06.026
I think the root
cause is not the lack of

08:06.027 --> 08:10.739
clear information, but the
abundance of misinformation.

08:10.740 --> 08:14.201
Our leaders need to do more
to stop people from coming up

08:14.202 --> 08:16.120
with conspiracy theories.

08:16.121 --> 08:18.539
- So, ignorance is bliss.

08:18.540 --> 08:21.709
Protecting people from dangerous ideas

08:21.710 --> 08:23.585
isn't making them ignorant.

08:23.586 --> 08:27.047
We need to make it our
priority to keep people safe.

08:27.048 --> 08:30.426
Keep them safe from what exactly?

08:30.427 --> 08:32.345
Another wave of vanishings.

08:34.179 --> 08:39.184
What? Hold on, a second
wave of vanishings.

08:39.309 --> 08:42.645
Well, we have been
feeding all of the data

08:42.647 --> 08:45.107
we've managed to gather
about the vanishings

08:45.108 --> 08:46.775
into a database.

08:46.776 --> 08:50.779
We were then able to use
sophisticated computer algorithms

08:50.780 --> 08:53.032
to create predictive models.

08:53.033 --> 08:55.576
And those models suggest
that a second wave

08:55.577 --> 08:59.204
is not only possible, it's almost certain.

08:59.205 --> 09:01.749
- So computers figured this out.

09:01.750 --> 09:02.750
That's right.

09:03.585 --> 09:06.503
- Do you yourself personally,

09:06.504 --> 09:08.714
believe more people are gonna disappear

09:08.715 --> 09:11.508
or do you think that people
are just better off scared

09:11.509 --> 09:14.595
right now, to keep them more compliant?

09:14.596 --> 09:16.805
I mean, we have a problem where people

09:16.806 --> 09:21.811
are so terrified and confused
that they're becoming violent

09:22.062 --> 09:23.353
and self-destructive.

09:23.354 --> 09:26.815
And you think coming on here
and scaring them even more

09:26.816 --> 09:28.650
is gonna somehow make things better?

09:28.651 --> 09:30.944
Are you saying that you know for a fact

09:30.945 --> 09:32.613
that it's not going to happen again?

09:32.614 --> 09:35.032
Not at all. Not at all.

09:35.033 --> 09:36.533
I have no idea.

09:36.534 --> 09:38.494
And I'm starting to
suspect that everybody,

09:38.495 --> 09:41.747
but at least I'm not sitting
here pretending like I do.

09:41.748 --> 09:44.458
I am talking about science here.

09:44.459 --> 09:47.836
And some of the world's top
scientists have studied the data

09:47.837 --> 09:49.296
very carefully and it's suggest-

09:49.297 --> 09:51.131
where did it come from?
— I'm sorry?

09:51.132 --> 09:52.716
The data.

09:52.717 --> 09:53.884
Where did it come from?

09:53.885 --> 09:57.763
All of the data has been
verified by the United Nations.

09:57.764 --> 10:00.516
It's all publicly available
in the UN's vanishing

10:00.517 --> 10:01.767
accountability project.

10:01.768 --> 10:05.979
I'm asking you, where did
they get their information from?

10:05.980 --> 10:07.731
- I just told you all of the
data has been verified by...

10:07.732 --> 10:08.608
Cut it now.

10:08.609 --> 10:10.067
Wrap it up.

10:10.068 --> 10:11.985
I'm sorry, but I guess
that is all the time we have

10:11.986 --> 10:12.862
for tonight.

10:12.862 --> 10:13.862
Thank you for coming on.

10:14.906 --> 10:17.699
But I do want to encourage our viewers,

10:17.700 --> 10:19.701
keep demanding facts.

10:19.702 --> 10:23.080
Don't just blindly accept
whatever the so-called experts

10:23.081 --> 10:24.248
are telling us.

10:24.249 --> 10:25.791
And I wouldn't be too quick to sign up for

10:25.792 --> 10:27.293
a vanishings vaccine either.

10:28.294 --> 10:31.964
I'm Cameron Williams. Up
next is Victoria Jordan.

10:31.965 --> 10:33.006
We'll see you in a minute.

10:33.007 --> 10:34.508
[Director] And we are out.

10:34.509 --> 10:35.509
Who killed that?

10:36.636 --> 10:38.179
We were not out of time.

10:39.556 --> 10:42.183
[Director] Back to first
position. Live in four minutes.

10:48.189 --> 10:52.402
Wow, captain Steele,
it's good to see you.

10:55.071 --> 10:55.905
Ooh.

10:55.905 --> 10:56.781
Hmm?

10:56.782 --> 11:01.285
- Captain, you are aware
that we do not encourage

11:01.286 --> 11:02.619
unkempt hair for our pilots.

11:02.620 --> 11:03.620
Are you not?

11:03.621 --> 11:05.330
Unkempt? I just showered last week.

11:05.331 --> 11:08.584
- And these pants, those aren't
standard issue, are they?

11:08.585 --> 11:09.502
Oh, and the next time we meet,

11:09.503 --> 11:10.711
I wanna see a shine on those feet.

11:10.712 --> 11:12.588
I'll see what I can do.

11:12.589 --> 11:14.382
- You look great, dad.

11:15.425 --> 11:17.718
- Hey, and look, look it...

11:17.719 --> 11:19.429
At least is still fits.
— mm—hmm.

11:21.848 --> 11:25.309
- So are you thinking of
getting into the pilot seat?

11:25.310 --> 11:27.102
Yeah, I was thinking maybe
I could do a couple runs

11:27.103 --> 11:30.564
for fedex, so I'm not
gone for days on end.

11:30.565 --> 11:35.445
I always hated being away so
much, from you and ram and mom.

11:36.779 --> 11:37.906
- Plus no passengers.

11:39.490 --> 11:43.161
- Yeah, plus no passengers.

11:45.788 --> 11:47.624
- Okay, captain.

11:50.293 --> 11:51.835
I'm hungry. Did you make me breakfast?

11:51.836 --> 11:52.961
- Did you make me breakfast?

11:52.962 --> 11:54.379
No. What do you mean
you're the ones up before me.

11:54.380 --> 11:55.380
All right.

11:56.174 --> 11:58.342
Where's Ivy? — I'm right here.

11:58.343 --> 11:59.260
- I can't believe you changed the b roll

11:59.261 --> 12:00.261
without asking me first.

12:00.262 --> 12:02.429
I didn't touch it after you approved it.

12:02.430 --> 12:03.931
I thought you were in the control room.

12:03.932 --> 12:05.308
I was. No one came in.

12:06.726 --> 12:07.726
[Both] Connor.

12:08.895 --> 12:10.646
Don't get connorfired. He's just a kid.

12:10.647 --> 12:12.522
You think I'm mad at
Connor? What's he gonna do?

12:12.523 --> 12:13.690
Say no to plank?

12:13.691 --> 12:14.567
I would have.

12:14.568 --> 12:15.984
Yeah, well, sure that's
why I didn't ask you.

12:15.985 --> 12:17.736
Or maybe it's because
there's only one guy here

12:17.737 --> 12:19.655
that knows how to swap the
footage in the live broadcast

12:19.656 --> 12:21.698
without setting foot of the control room.

12:21.699 --> 12:23.533
Did you really think I
would change your b roll

12:23.534 --> 12:25.410
in a live show without your approval?

12:25.411 --> 12:26.411
- Of course not.

12:27.205 --> 12:29.790
[Bruce] Buck's relentless
reporting brought gwn

12:29.791 --> 12:31.792
it's highest ratings ever.

12:31.793 --> 12:32.669
- Seriously?

12:32.670 --> 12:35.379
But it seemed the closer
he got to the truth,

12:35.380 --> 12:37.548
the more his own network pushed back.

12:38.383 --> 12:40.050
Mr. Williams, I'm so sorry.

12:40.051 --> 12:41.843
Ivy had no idea that the b
roll was gonna be changed.

12:41.844 --> 12:43.303
Connor, it's fine.

12:43.304 --> 12:44.972
I'm sure you weren't really
in a position to argue

12:44.973 --> 12:46.057
with Mr. Plank, right?

12:47.100 --> 12:48.810
Thank you for understanding sir.

12:49.686 --> 12:51.144
Plank. — be gentle.

12:51.145 --> 12:52.689
You know me better than that.

12:53.940 --> 12:56.858
Okay, Steve, I know you have
shareholders to appease,

12:56.859 --> 13:00.153
but I have a contract and
a pretty good one at that.

13:00.154 --> 13:00.989
And?

13:00.990 --> 13:03.573
And it means I don't have
to give primetime exposure

13:03.574 --> 13:06.243
to crackpot conspiracy theorists like her.

13:06.244 --> 13:07.995
- You're a reporter buck.

13:07.996 --> 13:10.747
Sometimes that means going
outside of your comfort zone

13:10.748 --> 13:14.419
and interviewing people that
you don't always agree with.

13:15.420 --> 13:19.631
I'm happy to talk to anybody
with a newsworthy story.

13:19.632 --> 13:23.218
It was fear mongering
plank, plain and simple.

13:23.219 --> 13:27.931
Computers, computers say
more people are gonna vanish.

13:27.932 --> 13:30.100
Well, maybe she should spend
her time trying to find people

13:30.101 --> 13:31.311
who already disappeared.

13:32.353 --> 13:33.895
- Are you done?

13:33.896 --> 13:36.065
What was up with that
b roll horror show?

13:37.525 --> 13:39.401
I thought you'd be pleased.

13:39.402 --> 13:42.654
I had our editors and the new kid

13:42.655 --> 13:46.783
dig up something a
little more sensational.

13:46.784 --> 13:48.702
- Sensational?

13:48.703 --> 13:52.247
Plank, you showed a video of
terrified and desperate people

13:52.248 --> 13:54.124
jumping off of buildings.

13:54.125 --> 13:55.334
That's not sensational.

13:55.335 --> 13:57.377
It's just sick. And using Connor.

13:57.378 --> 13:59.379
I mean, the kid's only
been here a few months.

13:59.380 --> 14:01.089
You're already teaching
'em the art of fake news.

14:01.090 --> 14:03.342
- Come on, wake up, buck.

14:03.343 --> 14:05.344
Our military and our
police were decimated with

14:05.345 --> 14:06.970
the vanishings.

14:06.971 --> 14:08.972
Scared people stay in their homes.

14:08.973 --> 14:11.350
They lock themselves inside.

14:11.351 --> 14:13.393
And that's what we need right now.

14:13.394 --> 14:15.604
Don't you think that
locking people in their homes

14:15.605 --> 14:17.898
is gonna add to the problem?

14:17.899 --> 14:19.483
We grieve by sharing.

14:19.484 --> 14:21.485
We have a lot of people that
need to deal with the fact that

14:21.486 --> 14:23.153
they lost everything that matters.

14:23.154 --> 14:24.781
Their wives, their...

14:26.824 --> 14:27.991
Yes, Erica.

14:27.992 --> 14:30.160
- Did you see the UN story?

14:30.161 --> 14:31.745
They're pushing for the Romanian president

14:31.746 --> 14:33.622
to be the new secretary general.

14:33.623 --> 14:34.623
- Carpathia.

14:35.541 --> 14:37.125
And so?

14:37.126 --> 14:40.462
- So it's just strange. He
didn't even ask to be appointed.

14:40.463 --> 14:43.382
Did they overtake the UN by force?

14:43.383 --> 14:45.300
- No, he hasn't even made a statement.

14:45.301 --> 14:46.843
Well, then it's not news.

14:46.844 --> 14:50.139
So please go out and find me some news.

14:57.146 --> 15:01.441
The last thing we need right
now are the streets overrun

15:01.442 --> 15:05.112
with unstable and
potentially violent people.

15:05.113 --> 15:07.781
So until the authorities
can get their arms,

15:07.782 --> 15:11.159
their fat arms around this thing,

15:11.160 --> 15:14.580
it is our duty to do what we can.

15:15.790 --> 15:18.917
If you think that somehow
it's your civic duty

15:18.918 --> 15:21.796
to terrify people, I can't stop you,

15:22.755 --> 15:25.383
but it's the last time you're
gonna do it on my show.

15:26.342 --> 15:29.594
Oh, well then maybe it's time to think

15:29.595 --> 15:32.014
about canceling your show.

15:35.893 --> 15:38.563
Yeah, I think we both know
that's not gonna happen.

15:41.899 --> 15:43.400
Try me.

15:43.401 --> 15:45.987
[Tense music]

16:05.715 --> 16:08.049
- [Bruce] It seems that
Chloe Steele spent most of

16:08.050 --> 16:09.759
her time haunted,

16:09.760 --> 16:12.220
tortured by the memory
of her little brother,

16:12.221 --> 16:14.974
vanishing right from her
arms as she hugged him.

16:16.350 --> 16:18.852
How could she have done
things differently?

16:18.853 --> 16:22.190
How could she have saved
him from whatever it was?

16:24.650 --> 16:27.195
She was terrified that
he was lost forever,

16:28.654 --> 16:31.407
and that somehow it was her fault.

16:33.868 --> 16:35.243
It has always been my position

16:35.244 --> 16:37.662
we should take advantage of every crisis

16:37.663 --> 16:39.456
to make the world a better place.

16:39.457 --> 16:42.918
With each disaster, storm
or war comes the opportunity

16:42.919 --> 16:45.880
for all of us to do better.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.298
As our climate gets hotter,

16:48.299 --> 16:50.967
as we become more interconnected,

16:50.968 --> 16:53.094
as pandemics race across the globe.

16:53.095 --> 16:55.096
Something is coming.

16:55.097 --> 16:58.309
Some crisis will strike all of us,

16:59.435 --> 17:02.687
and we should welcome
whatever it is with open arms.

17:02.688 --> 17:06.066
Because only then will the
world finally come together

17:06.067 --> 17:09.277
and create a truly global union,

17:09.278 --> 17:14.282
a single world government
founded on peace and unity.

17:27.046 --> 17:28.046
[Dirk] Buck, what's going on?

17:28.047 --> 17:30.215
Hey, remember that guy
davos last year talking

17:30.216 --> 17:33.760
about opportunity and catastrophe?

17:33.761 --> 17:35.262
- [Dirk] Well, that
was almost all of them.

17:35.263 --> 17:37.931
True. Well, this guy's name's cothran.

17:37.932 --> 17:40.809
He owns dominator analytics,
and I think he may be-

17:40.810 --> 17:42.978
whoa, whoa, whoa, let's
not do this over the phone.

17:42.979 --> 17:45.605
Let's just say it's a rabbit hole.

17:45.606 --> 17:48.483
- I do love a good rabbit
hole. I'm on my way.

17:48.484 --> 17:51.487
[Suspenseful music]

18:21.183 --> 18:22.768
[Chloe chuckles]

18:38.367 --> 18:40.952
Please help me. Where did he go?

18:40.953 --> 18:42.330
Please let me in.

18:44.415 --> 18:45.498
Let me in.

18:45.499 --> 18:47.710
Hey, wake up.

18:53.049 --> 18:54.133
Are you okay?

18:56.093 --> 18:57.511
Yeah, I'm fine.

19:00.056 --> 19:01.599
That must been quite a dream.

19:06.187 --> 19:08.188
It was just really real.

19:08.189 --> 19:09.564
You know, like it was like a nightmare

19:09.565 --> 19:14.320
but it's like I was
losing him all over again.

19:15.905 --> 19:19.324
Oh, we all have different
ways of dealing with things

19:19.325 --> 19:20.576
that we don't understand,

19:24.997 --> 19:27.249
but I think it's time
to focus on the future.

19:28.459 --> 19:33.088
And as hard as it is, we
have to stop looking back.

19:33.089 --> 19:35.091
Well then where am I supposed to look?

19:36.050 --> 19:37.592
Because back is where we lost them.

19:37.593 --> 19:38.803
I know, I know.

19:40.096 --> 19:43.557
You're not the only one who
needs to find a new approach.

19:44.892 --> 19:47.103
I mean, we have both
been hiding for too long.

19:50.231 --> 19:54.985
Mom and ramey, they're counting
on us to do the right thing.

19:55.986 --> 19:58.029
You mean they were counting on us?

19:58.030 --> 19:59.240
No. No.

20:00.324 --> 20:02.827
I mean, they are counting on us.

20:04.120 --> 20:05.621
And what makes you so sure?

20:08.833 --> 20:10.000
- Because mom told us.

20:12.169 --> 20:16.006
- Okay. But because mom said so?

20:17.007 --> 20:18.801
That didn't even work when I was 12.

20:20.261 --> 20:23.389
Besides, mom's rapture theory
has already been proven wrong.

20:24.432 --> 20:29.018
- So do you think mom was
stupid or just gullible?

20:29.019 --> 20:30.354
What? I never said that.

20:31.689 --> 20:36.401
Then don't you think that
we owe her the courtesy

20:36.402 --> 20:38.778
of considering the fact that she told us

20:38.779 --> 20:40.156
it was going to happen?

20:41.490 --> 20:44.034
Sure, it was easy to dismiss
it before it happened.

20:44.869 --> 20:49.289
But doesn't it seem strange
that it's still so easy

20:49.290 --> 20:50.750
to dismiss it now?

20:52.835 --> 20:56.213
Even though we saw it with our own eyes?

21:22.615 --> 21:24.533
[Door knocking] — enter.

21:28.954 --> 21:31.247
I thought you were gonna
at least try to stop acting

21:31.248 --> 21:32.832
like a crazy conspiracy theorist.

21:32.833 --> 21:35.418
Whoa. Who are you calling
a conspiracy theorist?

21:35.419 --> 21:37.212
- Oh, so you're just
admitting to being crazy?

21:37.213 --> 21:39.131
- Yes, I'm quite comfortable with that.

21:40.216 --> 21:41.216
Shut the door.

21:43.302 --> 21:44.302
Here.

21:45.221 --> 21:48.515
So cothran and his dominator analytics

21:48.516 --> 21:50.350
provides virtually all the raw data,

21:50.351 --> 21:51.976
the UN compiles all of it.

21:51.977 --> 21:54.062
Surveys, research studies, polls.

21:54.063 --> 21:56.856
These guys do it all. And
they've got the market cornered.

21:56.857 --> 21:59.150
- So you're saying they can
just stand up and tell the world

21:59.151 --> 22:01.152
anything they want and
they'd be able to back it up

22:01.153 --> 22:02.362
with fake stats?

22:02.363 --> 22:03.239
Yep.

22:03.240 --> 22:05.114
What about the vanishings?

22:05.115 --> 22:07.033
All those reports about
the earth's total mass,

22:07.034 --> 22:08.284
not changing that day.

22:08.285 --> 22:11.704
Statistics about how many people
disappeared, who they were,

22:11.705 --> 22:13.206
how they might have been
different from the rest of us

22:13.207 --> 22:14.582
those? — yep.

22:14.583 --> 22:16.417
All of it came through dominator.

22:16.418 --> 22:17.961
Wow.

22:17.962 --> 22:20.713
Well, at least we know
what cothran's agenda is.

22:20.714 --> 22:22.674
He's a crisis to get us to accept changes

22:22.675 --> 22:24.050
that we wouldn't have othennise.

22:24.051 --> 22:26.261
When you have complete control
over the narrative like that

22:26.262 --> 22:28.972
guy does, I mean, you can
turn anything into a crisis.

22:28.973 --> 22:30.348
That's all true.

22:30.349 --> 22:32.183
But cothran's not the
guy calling the shots.

22:32.184 --> 22:34.352
He's just another suit.

22:34.353 --> 22:35.813
- So who's calling the shots?

22:42.486 --> 22:45.281
- These are interconnected corporations.

22:46.490 --> 22:50.410
15 television networks.
120 individual stations.

22:50.411 --> 22:52.328
Almost 300 newspapers.

22:52.329 --> 22:53.955
Remember, newspapers?

22:53.956 --> 22:57.166
Let's see, two Hollywood film studios.

22:57.167 --> 23:00.378
14 of the top 20 magazines,
believe it or not,

23:00.379 --> 23:03.631
the two biggest pharmaceutical
companies in the world.

23:03.632 --> 23:05.259
That's how we got rich off covid.

23:06.302 --> 23:08.428
Here's one you might find interesting.

23:08.429 --> 23:09.762
He's your boss.

23:09.763 --> 23:11.180
Gwn? No, that's not right.

23:11.181 --> 23:13.099
Gwn's owned by the dornan family.

23:13.100 --> 23:16.144
No. Oh, have you ever met the dornans?

23:16.145 --> 23:16.979
No.

23:16.980 --> 23:19.480
- That's because there is
no dornan family, never was.

23:19.481 --> 23:22.025
Jack dornan, never married,
didn't have a family.

23:22.026 --> 23:23.735
He's been dead for 30 years.

23:23.736 --> 23:27.447
All of these companies are
owned directly or indirectly

23:27.448 --> 23:31.159
by one man, Jonathan stonagal.

23:31.160 --> 23:32.619
Like the Eden guy.

23:32.620 --> 23:33.704
- One and the same.

23:34.747 --> 23:36.915
He's been pushing something
called the great reset

23:36.916 --> 23:40.920
for years, a true new
world order globalist.

23:41.921 --> 23:44.255
I wouldn't have a hard time
getting this message out.

23:44.256 --> 23:45.132
I mean, what?

23:45.133 --> 23:46.841
Eden alone already has 5 billion users?

23:46.842 --> 23:49.302
- Nope, six and a half now.
- — geeze.

23:49.303 --> 23:51.638
What's amazing is that
he tripled his wealth

23:51.639 --> 23:53.139
during the covid pandemic,

23:53.140 --> 23:56.268
and he tripled it again in the
aftermath of the vanishings.

23:57.144 --> 23:58.062
Let's go.

23:58.063 --> 24:01.065
[Suspenseful music]

24:04.902 --> 24:06.819
So where were you?

24:06.820 --> 24:07.696
- Sorry?

24:07.697 --> 24:09.906
Where were you when it happened?

24:09.907 --> 24:13.242
Oh, I was in a plane,
halfway across the Atlantic.

24:13.243 --> 24:15.244
Ah, I was right.

24:15.245 --> 24:16.205
- About what?

24:16.206 --> 24:18.046
That you would have a
cooler story than I do.

24:18.958 --> 24:23.586
Yeah. Best and worst day of my life.

24:23.587 --> 24:24.755
- Way outta your league.

24:25.673 --> 24:27.298
Never let a crisis go to waste, right?

24:27.299 --> 24:28.299
Yeah.

24:28.969 --> 24:32.136
- So tell me, did her boyfriend disappear?

24:32.137 --> 24:34.389
What? How brave do you think I am?

24:34.390 --> 24:36.307
No, we didn't disappear.

24:36.308 --> 24:37.851
He was hit by a driverless bus.

24:39.436 --> 24:40.436
- And |'|| say,

24:45.651 --> 24:47.778
Oh, here, hold this and keep an eye out.

24:48.946 --> 24:51.322
Oh, it's heavy. Made of lead?

24:51.323 --> 24:54.784
- Not made of, no, but coated with.

24:54.785 --> 24:55.910
The feds have devices

24:55.911 --> 24:57.495
that can download your entire hard drive

24:57.496 --> 24:58.496
from 10 feet away.

24:59.623 --> 25:01.332
- You ever heard of a safe?

25:01.333 --> 25:03.960
Yeah. It's in the office filing cabinet,

25:03.961 --> 25:06.004
bolted to the floor.

25:06.005 --> 25:07.005
Let's go.

25:10.676 --> 25:12.552
And one day I'm gonna stumble
into the wrong minefield

25:12.553 --> 25:14.012
and the feds are gonna clean up my office,

25:14.013 --> 25:15.972
including the safe.

25:15.973 --> 25:17.098
What are they gonna find?

25:17.099 --> 25:19.100
Hard drive full of encrypted files.

25:19.101 --> 25:20.268
And if they keep at it long enough,

25:20.269 --> 25:22.478
they'll crack the encryption
and get the grand prize.

25:22.479 --> 25:24.105
Which is what?

25:24.106 --> 25:26.274
- 30 seasons of "the Simpsons".

25:26.275 --> 25:27.817
That's gonna tick them off.

25:27.818 --> 25:29.445
Oh, maybe not. It's blu-ray.

25:32.823 --> 25:35.409
[Upbeat music]

25:50.049 --> 25:52.133
- [Bruce] Chloe couldn't
help but wonder if her dad

25:52.134 --> 25:53.134
was right.

25:54.303 --> 25:56.929
What if mom and ramey were
lost because of something

25:56.930 --> 25:57.931
in that book?

25:58.766 --> 26:01.476
All she could do was wish
her mom had never opened

26:01.477 --> 26:04.104
that stupid Bible in the first place.

26:26.919 --> 26:29.171
Buck and Chloe met on
the day of the rapture.

26:30.130 --> 26:33.424
Buck had been a passenger on
that flight piloted by ray.

26:33.425 --> 26:35.843
Many romantics would say it
was fate that brought buck

26:35.844 --> 26:37.053
and Chloe together.

26:37.054 --> 26:37.930
- Oh, heck yes.

26:37.930 --> 26:38.889
[Bruce] But I now know that there was

26:38.890 --> 26:40.807
a far greater force at work.

26:40.808 --> 26:42.225
They needed to be together.

26:42.226 --> 26:43.102
Thank you.

26:43.103 --> 26:44.477
- [Bruce] God had a plan.

26:44.478 --> 26:46.521
I know it's not just about plank though.

26:46.522 --> 26:49.107
It's whole network,
whole business, really?

26:49.108 --> 26:51.192
I honestly don't even
want to do it anymore.

26:51.193 --> 26:52.194
Are you kidding?

26:53.070 --> 26:56.781
You have the biggest
audience in cable news.

26:56.782 --> 26:58.741
Yeah. Well, that would be
a good thing if I didn't have

26:58.742 --> 27:00.911
to put air quotes around the word news.

27:02.496 --> 27:04.206
- Hey, look, look at these people.

27:05.332 --> 27:08.417
They know who you are. They trust you.

27:08.418 --> 27:10.294
They trust you, even if
they've never met you.

27:10.295 --> 27:12.338
- See, that's the problem.

27:12.339 --> 27:14.924
They trust me to tell them the truth.

27:14.925 --> 27:18.803
The news, it's no longer about
truth. It's about a message.

27:18.804 --> 27:21.889
And facts don't even matter anymore.

27:21.890 --> 27:24.851
I go on that show every
single night and lie to them

27:24.852 --> 27:27.396
as if we're too afraid they
can't handle the truth.

27:29.189 --> 27:30.315
Hi. — hey. Yeah.

27:32.442 --> 27:34.403
[Camera clicks] Great.

27:37.698 --> 27:38.949
I used to love my job.

27:40.159 --> 27:43.995
I was an investigative
journalist for 10 years.

27:43.996 --> 27:45.538
You know what I did?

27:45.539 --> 27:48.583
I investigated things that
needed to be investigated,

27:48.584 --> 27:52.254
and then I actually told
people about what I found.

27:57.885 --> 27:58.885
And now?

27:59.803 --> 28:01.596
Now I'm more like an actor.

28:01.597 --> 28:03.097
I do my lines

28:03.098 --> 28:06.142
and depending on whatever
story we decide to report,

28:06.143 --> 28:10.646
I try to convince the
world that things are way,

28:10.647 --> 28:13.984
way better or far, far worse
than they actually are.

28:16.028 --> 28:18.197
I just feel like my audience
is smarter than that.

28:19.740 --> 28:21.532
They're not a bunch of religious wackos

28:21.533 --> 28:23.743
who are only looking for easy answers

28:23.744 --> 28:27.455
and don't require facts or two
seconds of their own thought.

28:27.456 --> 28:28.873
Wackos like my mom?

28:28.874 --> 28:31.918
- Chloe, no, I didn't mean that.

28:31.919 --> 28:33.336
I'm trying to process every...

28:33.337 --> 28:37.798
[Alarms blaring]
[Phones ringing]

28:37.799 --> 28:38.717
[Woman] Are you seeing this?

28:38.718 --> 28:42.178
[Woman 2] Oh, dear, I can't believe it.

28:42.179 --> 28:43.512
- Second wave.

28:43.513 --> 28:44.513
Here we go.

28:47.059 --> 28:48.852
I think I need to get to the studio.

28:51.104 --> 28:53.397
Are you okay? — yeah.

28:53.398 --> 28:55.067
Okay, I'll call you later.

28:58.737 --> 29:01.864
Although there are plenty of
rumors and Internet chatter,

29:01.865 --> 29:04.784
tracking down eyewitnesses
has actually been harder

29:04.785 --> 29:06.035
than we expected.

29:06.036 --> 29:09.497
One notable witness was
apparently senator Arthur Brandon.

29:09.498 --> 29:11.832
But while he has issued a statement,

29:11.833 --> 29:14.835
he has so far been unwilling
to speak to the media.

29:14.836 --> 29:18.005
In fact, we've been having a
hard time tracking down anyone

29:18.006 --> 29:20.591
who's actually witnessed a new vanishing.

29:20.592 --> 29:23.135
It's like everybody knows
there was a second wave,

29:23.136 --> 29:26.013
but nobody's actually seen it happen.

29:26.014 --> 29:29.183
So, Anna, while we wait
for our coverage of

29:29.184 --> 29:32.270
the UN press conference, what
do you think about all this?

29:32.271 --> 29:35.940
I believe him. He's a
senator and he's a good man.

29:35.941 --> 29:37.775
Why would one of our
own government officials

29:37.776 --> 29:39.318
make something like that up?

29:39.319 --> 29:42.154
Just to scare us? It's ridiculous.

29:42.155 --> 29:43.364
Well, just like last time, I mean,

29:43.365 --> 29:45.741
there weren't any reports
of unusual activity

29:45.742 --> 29:47.243
in the skies or around the earth's orbit.

29:47.244 --> 29:50.413
So are you still sticking
with the ufo theory?

29:50.414 --> 29:51.706
- Of course.

29:51.707 --> 29:53.124
What else could have
done something like this?

29:53.125 --> 29:55.668
Many of the scientists
I spoke to seem to

29:55.669 --> 29:58.587
think that this is not the
first time these vanishings

29:58.588 --> 30:00.089
have happened on this planet.

30:00.090 --> 30:02.800
Certainly the first
time any of us noticed.

30:02.801 --> 30:05.052
We're talking millions of years ago,

30:05.053 --> 30:07.930
long before people were recording history.

30:07.931 --> 30:10.182
In fact, it's probably
why there are gaping holes

30:10.183 --> 30:12.101
in the fossil records showing the totality

30:12.102 --> 30:13.144
of human evolution.

30:13.145 --> 30:15.604
Well, maybe the ufos
have been here many times.

30:15.605 --> 30:17.023
And then why has nobody seen them?

30:17.024 --> 30:18.858
- You just said there
was no one here to report

30:18.859 --> 30:20.151
the visits millions of years ago.

30:20.152 --> 30:22.862
Okay, reverend pinkus,
what do you think?

30:22.863 --> 30:25.781
I mean, you originally
stated that the vanishings

30:25.782 --> 30:27.575
were the Christian rapture.

30:27.576 --> 30:29.410
I mean, is that still right?

30:29.411 --> 30:32.288
That's true. It was
actually a bit scary.

30:32.289 --> 30:33.998
But so many christians are still here,

30:33.999 --> 30:35.791
including hundreds from my own church,

30:35.792 --> 30:39.045
that there's no way that it
could have been the rapture.

30:39.046 --> 30:41.213
Now that doesn't mean that
god didn't have his hand

30:41.214 --> 30:42.840
in it, though,

30:42.841 --> 30:45.426
the Bible does teach that god will send

30:45.427 --> 30:47.887
a powerful delusion in the last days.

30:47.888 --> 30:50.765
And I personally believe that
this whole vanishing thing

30:50.766 --> 30:52.059
is part of that.

30:53.226 --> 30:55.269
Well, let's all try our best not to add

30:55.270 --> 30:56.396
to those delusions.

30:57.439 --> 30:58.689
- What about you, buck?

30:58.690 --> 30:59.690
What do you think?

31:01.068 --> 31:02.985
Well, the way I see it,

31:02.986 --> 31:06.781
there's only one explanation
that doesn't require an appeal

31:06.782 --> 31:11.202
to an imaginary power or unseen force.

31:11.203 --> 31:12.746
That's simply a new technology.

31:13.830 --> 31:16.123
I mean, you'd think we'd
stop being so surprised

31:16.124 --> 31:20.294
at what the human race is capable
of creating at this point.

31:20.295 --> 31:23.339
We all watch people disappear
on "Star Trek" growing up,

31:23.340 --> 31:26.258
communicators, translators,
androids, robots,

31:26.259 --> 31:27.760
they're all realities now.

31:27.761 --> 31:30.096
So why not the transporter beam?

31:30.097 --> 31:32.348
- So you're saying this
is a man-made weapon.

31:32.349 --> 31:35.267
I never said it was a
weapon, I said technology.

31:35.268 --> 31:39.313
Arthur c. Clarke once said
that any sufficiently advanced

31:39.314 --> 31:42.109
technology is
indistinguishable from magic.

31:43.151 --> 31:45.820
What I take away from that
is we don't need to look

31:45.821 --> 31:47.571
for magic just because we don't understand

31:47.572 --> 31:48.949
how something works.

31:51.827 --> 31:53.744
I just got report that
we are about to begin

31:53.745 --> 31:55.705
our coverage of the UN press conference.

31:57.249 --> 31:58.749
Less than a year ago,

31:58.750 --> 32:00.584
if someone had told me
that millions of people

32:00.585 --> 32:03.421
were just gonna disappear,
I, like you would've said

32:03.422 --> 32:04.548
they were crazy.

32:06.258 --> 32:10.846
Fast foward to today and the
unimaginable has become real.

32:11.930 --> 32:13.222
And with the news at the vanishings,

32:13.223 --> 32:15.516
we're not simply a one—time event.

32:15.517 --> 32:18.519
We should all be reminded
that we have no choice

32:18.520 --> 32:22.481
but to face this
unprecedented threat together.

32:22.482 --> 32:25.025
Not as individual nation
states divided by rivers

32:25.026 --> 32:28.779
or mountains, or
thousands of years of war,

32:28.780 --> 32:31.365
but as one people united at last.

32:31.366 --> 32:34.202
[People clapping]

32:36.705 --> 32:40.667
Fellow citizens of the
world, welcome to the future,

32:41.626 --> 32:44.128
welcome to a new reality,

32:44.129 --> 32:48.090
a great reset where we move
from a tribal mentality

32:48.091 --> 32:50.801
to a united and unstoppable force

32:50.802 --> 32:52.344
ready to face any challenge.

32:52.345 --> 32:55.097
Because there is no greater
power in the universe

32:55.098 --> 32:57.308
than a unified human race.

32:57.309 --> 33:00.769
[People clapping]

33:00.770 --> 33:03.522
You already know, the
second wave of vanishings,

33:03.523 --> 33:05.734
even though the extent is not yet known,

33:06.610 --> 33:09.820
has thrown the financial
markets back into chaos.

33:09.821 --> 33:12.616
And while the major stock
exchanges quickly closed,

33:13.575 --> 33:16.118
the losses were already
catastrophic from panic selling

33:16.119 --> 33:19.413
in every country in the world.

33:19.414 --> 33:22.625
The world monetary fund has
also issued a formal warning

33:22.626 --> 33:26.086
that more than 100 countries
will likely be bankrupt

33:26.087 --> 33:27.796
within 60 days.

33:27.797 --> 33:31.884
And within a year, more than
90% of the world's citizens

33:31.885 --> 33:33.345
will be living in poverty.

33:34.596 --> 33:37.264
Fortunately, we have a solution.

33:37.265 --> 33:38.432
[People clapping]

33:38.433 --> 33:40.643
[Bruce] And there it
was, a surreal moment

33:40.644 --> 33:42.228
to say the least,

33:42.229 --> 33:45.105
one of the most powerful men
on the planet standing in front

33:45.106 --> 33:48.025
of the world and promising
a one world economy,

33:48.026 --> 33:51.987
a one world currency, and the
path to peace and prosperity,

33:51.988 --> 33:55.241
exactly the system the
Bible told us was coming.

33:55.242 --> 33:57.493
And unsurprisingly, the people,

33:57.494 --> 34:00.746
and especially the news
media, 'just gobbled it up.

34:00.747 --> 34:02.706
- Today under emergency conditions,

34:02.707 --> 34:05.459
and with a nearly unanimous consent,

34:05.460 --> 34:08.879

voted to approve and mandate

Dr. Chaim rosensweig.

34:17.304 --> 34:20.139
Now, the reason I'm part of
this announcement is that Eden,

the largest social media platform ever,

34:23.228 --> 34:26.772
has agreed to make all our
resources available to the UN

34:26.773 --> 34:30.192
free of charge in order to
ensure that we can implement

be the first interview.

So good to see you again.

34:55.302 --> 34:58.178
Mr. Stonagal, thank you so
much for taking the time

34:58.179 --> 34:59.805
to be with us tonight.

34:59.806 --> 35:03.976
Now, this is a lot bigger
news than I think most people

35:03.977 --> 35:05.144
actually realize.

35:05.145 --> 35:06.687
I mean, Mr. Stonagal,

35:06.688 --> 35:09.064
you must have jumped through
a lot of hoops to get this

35:09.065 --> 35:11.233
to where it is at the UN, correct?

35:11.234 --> 35:13.527
Well, there are some very smart people

35:13.528 --> 35:15.613
in extremely powerful
positions around the world,

35:15.614 --> 35:18.574
and they see the need and
wisely recognized Eden pay

35:18.575 --> 35:19.659
as the best solution.

35:20.619 --> 35:24.705
Now, you said that you had
essentially unanimous support

35:24.706 --> 35:25.874
from the UN membership.

35:26.833 --> 35:28.876
Can I assume that essentially unanimous

35:28.877 --> 35:31.295
is different from unanimous?

35:31.296 --> 35:32.838
Well, a few of the
members have questions,

35:32.839 --> 35:34.340
but that's to be expected.

35:34.341 --> 35:36.884
Fortunately, none that we can't answer.

35:36.885 --> 35:39.261
Do you mind telling
us who the holdouts are?

35:39.262 --> 35:41.805
All nations have formally
agreed with two exceptions,

35:41.806 --> 35:43.266
Romania and Israel.

35:44.184 --> 35:45.184
Interesting.

35:46.186 --> 35:49.605
Dr. Rosensweig, I'm a
little confused by that.

35:49.606 --> 35:51.398
Why would Israel be holding out?

35:51.399 --> 35:54.818
I mean, isn't Eden built
on Israeli technology?

35:54.819 --> 35:56.528
- Israel has not signed the agreement yet

35:56.529 --> 35:59.823
because there are deal
terms to be negotiated.

35:59.824 --> 36:01.617
Are those financial terms?

36:01.618 --> 36:03.410
Oh, no, no, nothing of that sort.

36:03.411 --> 36:05.245
There are other issues involved,

36:05.246 --> 36:07.665
including ongoing peace talks.

36:07.666 --> 36:11.126
We want to ensure that Eden
ushers in an era of peace

36:11.127 --> 36:14.380
for Israel and indeed
for the entire world.

36:14.381 --> 36:18.008
- So we actually have
peace in the middle east

36:18.009 --> 36:19.009
as a deal term.

36:20.470 --> 36:21.470
Wow.

36:23.264 --> 36:28.018
No, no, no way.

36:28.019 --> 36:30.980
Could you just get the victim
to come on camera and...

36:32.440 --> 36:36.068
No. Alright, then we'll go
with the fake Jesus guy.

36:36.069 --> 36:37.361
Make sure you get him on camera.

36:37.362 --> 36:39.405
Taking credit for the new vanishings.

36:39.406 --> 36:41.115
Look, I gotta go.

36:41.116 --> 36:43.325
I gotta walk the dog. What's it to you?

36:43.326 --> 36:44.326
Good bye.

36:47.080 --> 36:49.206
Tough day at the ministry of truth.

36:49.207 --> 36:51.417
Can't you tell that I'm not in the mood?

36:51.418 --> 36:52.918
I hate to be the one to
break it to you, Steve,

36:52.919 --> 36:54.879
but you always look like that.

36:55.755 --> 36:58.590
So to recap,

36:58.591 --> 37:01.927
two days after I have
a guest come on my show

37:01.928 --> 37:05.055
and predict a second wave of vanishings,

37:05.056 --> 37:07.141
we have a second wave of vanishings.

37:07.142 --> 37:08.225
It wasn't a prediction.

37:08.226 --> 37:10.979
She was simply reporting
what the model said.

37:11.896 --> 37:14.982
- Computers spit out data.
- People make predictions.

37:14.983 --> 37:16.567
Anyways, long story short,

37:16.568 --> 37:19.236
I decided to look into her
claims a little more carefully

37:19.237 --> 37:21.196
like I would've done before the show

37:21.197 --> 37:23.407
had I actually known that
you were gonna have her on.

37:23.408 --> 37:26.535
Thank you for that, by the
way, she's an interesting lady.

37:26.536 --> 37:27.619
I'll give you that.

37:27.620 --> 37:30.873
She works closely with a man
named Joshua Todd-cothran,

37:30.874 --> 37:33.417
who I've actually heard give his message

37:33.418 --> 37:37.212
on how he wants to
introduce a new world order.

37:37.213 --> 37:39.548
These people are obsessed
with the idea of having

37:39.549 --> 37:43.302
a one world government that
somehow will solve all poverty

37:43.303 --> 37:44.179
and wars.

37:44.179 --> 37:45.179
How dare they.

37:45.972 --> 37:49.057
The road to hell is paved
with good intentions, Steve.

37:49.058 --> 37:53.020
So their plan for several
years now has been to create

37:53.021 --> 37:55.898
an infrastructure for global order by,

37:55.899 --> 37:57.441
this is the important part,

37:57.442 --> 37:59.526
by waiting for a global catastrophe.

37:59.527 --> 38:01.737
And then they're gonna use
all the fear and uncertainty

38:01.738 --> 38:03.906
in the world to get
people to accept changes

38:03.907 --> 38:06.492
they never would've
accepted before the crisis.

38:06.493 --> 38:09.703
There's nothing new there,
and it certainly isn't news.

38:09.704 --> 38:11.497
Okay, well, I'm not finished yet either.

38:11.498 --> 38:14.917
Then I have Dr. Kincaid come on my show

38:14.918 --> 38:16.460
and says she has computer models

38:16.461 --> 38:19.505
that are pointing towards
a second wave of vanishing.

38:19.506 --> 38:22.466
- So she was right. I guess
you owe her an apology.

38:22.467 --> 38:24.343
- Yeah, you would think so.

38:24.344 --> 38:27.846
Except I'm not entirely convinced

38:27.847 --> 38:29.516
anyone vanished this time around.

38:30.475 --> 38:32.935
You see, I was able to
find the source of the data

38:32.936 --> 38:35.229
that was used to make that prediction.

38:35.230 --> 38:38.148
90% of it came from one firm,

38:38.149 --> 38:42.236
dominator analytics owned
by Joshua Todd-cothran.

38:42.237 --> 38:44.947
So we have a guy who
thinks we need to scare

38:44.948 --> 38:46.156
the hell outta people.

38:46.157 --> 38:48.742
Now, scaring the hell outta people.

38:48.743 --> 38:50.077
- Buck, you don't have facts.

38:50.078 --> 38:52.037
You're spitballing.

38:52.038 --> 38:53.580
- He's not alone.

38:53.581 --> 38:56.918
He's got a partner, Jonathan stonagal.

38:58.419 --> 38:59.419
Yeah.

38:59.420 --> 39:03.048
So these guys, whose fundamental mandate

39:03.049 --> 39:05.342
is to terrify people,

39:05.343 --> 39:08.053
not only announce a second wave in advance

39:08.054 --> 39:10.472
and then use their own
stats to back it up,

39:10.473 --> 39:12.224
but are now telling us that
they're gonna take over

39:12.225 --> 39:15.060
the world bank and we
don't have a choice except

39:15.061 --> 39:17.521
to just go with it.

39:17.522 --> 39:18.897
Bottom line.

39:18.898 --> 39:21.900
I think these new vanishing
counts that we so proudly

39:21.901 --> 39:25.028
display on all the screens
during every broadcast

39:25.029 --> 39:26.364
are probably fake.

39:32.287 --> 39:33.495
Is that it?

39:33.496 --> 39:36.748
- Nope, definitely not. I
haven't even started digging yet.

39:36.749 --> 39:38.042
And you're not going to.

39:38.918 --> 39:42.546
Look, I know you've got
your beloved fan base.

39:42.547 --> 39:44.256
Yeah, give him something to chew on.

39:44.257 --> 39:46.049
But you say it every day of the week.

39:46.050 --> 39:48.886
We are not in the conspiracy business.

39:48.887 --> 39:51.096
Okay, plank, this isn't a conspiracy.

39:51.097 --> 39:52.931
This is the biggest news story

39:52.932 --> 39:54.308
since the vanishings themselves.

39:54.309 --> 39:56.101
No, no, that is not the big news story.

39:56.102 --> 39:58.395
The big news story is that
the world is suffering

39:58.396 --> 40:01.940
and we are teetering on
the brink of mass insanity.

40:01.941 --> 40:04.568
You start questioning the
facts, the only facts,

40:04.569 --> 40:07.029
the few facts that we actually have

40:07.030 --> 40:08.781
and you just make everything worse.

40:10.158 --> 40:11.992
Okay plank, listen to me.

40:11.993 --> 40:13.703
No, you listen to me.

40:14.746 --> 40:18.081
You drag this line of
nonsense into the public eye,

40:18.082 --> 40:21.044
you and I were both finished
in the news business forever.

40:22.629 --> 40:23.879
I don't wanna hear another word on this.

40:23.880 --> 40:26.673
You don't share any of it with the staff.

40:26.674 --> 40:29.052
This conversation is over. Are we clear?

40:30.470 --> 40:31.971
You're wrong about this one.

40:34.641 --> 40:36.058
Are we clear?

40:36.059 --> 40:39.062
[Suspenseful music]

41:32.573 --> 41:33.741
- Oh, finally.

41:49.632 --> 41:50.967
Oh, come on. This is crazy.

42:06.566 --> 42:08.108
[Bruce] I'm glad ray didn't find what

42:08.109 --> 42:10.111
he was looking for on Irene's phone.

42:11.029 --> 42:14.031
God's hand was on him and
he ended up right where

42:14.032 --> 42:15.033
he needed to be.

42:23.708 --> 42:25.542
Jesus told us in the last days

42:25.543 --> 42:27.420
the world would hate christians.

42:30.006 --> 42:32.466
The first rocks through
the window at new hope

42:32.467 --> 42:34.969
came only about an hour after the rapture.

42:46.939 --> 42:49.566
So why do people who
don't even believe in god

42:49.567 --> 42:51.736
suddenly hate him so much?

42:56.574 --> 42:59.493
Because they have no
one else to blame it on.

42:59.494 --> 43:02.497
[Suspenseful music]

44:34.463 --> 44:35.463
Hello?

45:02.742 --> 45:05.953
- [Bruce] Sometimes the
hate exploded into violence.

45:08.539 --> 45:11.500
And you know what? Maybe I deserved it.

45:13.836 --> 45:16.129
If ray hadn't shown up that day,

45:16.130 --> 45:18.757
who knows if I would've found my way.

45:18.758 --> 45:19.592
Pastor Barnes.

45:19.593 --> 45:21.885
[Bruce] I may have given up on god,

45:21.886 --> 45:26.765
but I'm humbled to know that
god hadn't given up on me.

45:26.766 --> 45:28.601
How's it going, ray?

45:56.754 --> 46:01.759
[Siren blaring] [Dogs barking]

46:09.558 --> 46:14.522
[Intense music] [Chloe shouting]

46:33.958 --> 46:36.794
[Chloe screaming]

46:50.057 --> 46:52.559
But even in total darkness,

46:52.560 --> 46:54.937
god can find a way to light the path.

46:56.522 --> 46:58.274
Even with the faintest glint.

47:06.324 --> 47:11.329
[Siren blaring]
[Suspenseful music]

47:21.756 --> 47:23.966
It's uh, the only thing I can find.

47:25.509 --> 47:26.509
Thanks.

47:29.138 --> 47:30.680
What happened here?

47:30.681 --> 47:32.599
Bunch of hooligans.

47:32.600 --> 47:34.477
Who can blame them? They're scared.

47:36.437 --> 47:39.064
- So you okay?

47:39.065 --> 47:41.567
Yeah, it's just my job.

47:44.487 --> 47:46.446
To what do I owe this pleasure.

47:46.447 --> 47:49.033
It's not like you've ever
been a big fan of this place.

47:50.368 --> 47:53.411
Shouldn't I be the one who
surprised to see you here?

47:53.412 --> 47:54.412
- I suppose so.

47:58.125 --> 47:59.251
What is it ray?

48:03.172 --> 48:04.924
Was it the rapture?

48:06.342 --> 48:08.551
Yes. Yes it was.

48:08.552 --> 48:09.928
- Are you sure?

48:09.929 --> 48:11.763
You really sure?

48:11.764 --> 48:13.599
You know what finally convinced me?

48:15.309 --> 48:17.019
When I saw it happen.

48:20.064 --> 48:23.608
- So, Irene and Raymond.

48:23.609 --> 48:26.445
They're fine, ray, they're
in heaven for eternity.

48:31.033 --> 48:32.534
- — But then.
- Go ahead, ray.

48:32.535 --> 48:34.035
You can ask.

48:34.036 --> 48:36.037
Why are you still here?

48:36.038 --> 48:38.624
- Because I asked god to leave me behind.

48:39.875 --> 48:42.335
I'm not done living my life down here.

48:42.336 --> 48:43.963
So I didn't wanna leave too soon.

48:45.714 --> 48:47.133
Is that good enough for you?

48:49.927 --> 48:51.429
It would be if it were true.

49:06.861 --> 49:08.987
Chloe? — hi, Dr. Wright.

49:08.988 --> 49:12.031
I just.

49:12.032 --> 49:13.867
What? Oh my. Oh goodness.

49:13.868 --> 49:15.910
What happened to you? Come inside.

49:15.911 --> 49:16.911
Thank you.

49:17.830 --> 49:19.039
- Come on upstairs.

49:21.792 --> 49:26.129
Well, this looks pretty angry,
but it's fairly shallow.

49:26.130 --> 49:28.590
No stitches required.

49:28.591 --> 49:31.718
I'll just give it a good
rinse and apply some topical

49:31.719 --> 49:35.055
antibiotic, which should
also help with the pain.

49:37.349 --> 49:40.102
Thanks, Dr. Wright.
— oh, Amanda.

49:44.106 --> 49:45.107
Hi, fern.

49:46.775 --> 49:49.027
Chloe, this is fern.

49:49.028 --> 49:51.822
Fern, this is Irene's daughter, Chloe.

49:56.827 --> 50:01.414
Honey, I'm on borrowed time,
so I'm just gonna say it.

50:01.415 --> 50:02.917
You messed up big.

50:14.803 --> 50:16.930
[Bruce] Ray wanted
to talk about prophecy

50:16.931 --> 50:18.098
and who could blame him?

50:19.725 --> 50:22.143
His wife told him the
rapture was going to happen

50:22.144 --> 50:23.144
and it did.

50:23.145 --> 50:24.688
So of course he was curious.

50:27.525 --> 50:29.317
Me on the other hand,

50:29.318 --> 50:31.611
I guess I was just still
pouting and feeling sorry

50:31.612 --> 50:32.612
for myself.

50:34.281 --> 50:37.450
But ray managed to drag me
into his little Bible study

50:37.451 --> 50:40.662
with what he would later admit
was an intentional mistake.

50:40.663 --> 50:42.997
Seven. — huh?

50:42.998 --> 50:45.083
It's not six years, it's seven.

50:45.084 --> 50:46.084
- Oh.

50:47.169 --> 50:50.338
Tribulation doesn't start
when the rapture happens.

50:50.339 --> 50:53.007
The seven year clock doesn't
start counting down until

50:53.008 --> 50:55.802
there's a sign of a seven
year peace agreement

50:55.803 --> 50:58.055
between Israel and her enemies.

51:00.516 --> 51:02.892
And you know what else
you find out on that day?

51:02.893 --> 51:06.146
What? — who the antichrist is.

51:08.440 --> 51:11.234
He's the one that confirms the treaty

51:11.235 --> 51:13.862
until then his identity
is anybody's guess.

51:16.240 --> 51:19.784
So then who is this
antichrist? I mean, is it Satan?

51:19.785 --> 51:24.455
Not exactly. The antichrist
is Satan's counterfeit Jesus.

51:24.456 --> 51:26.874
He's sent here to lie and deceive.

51:26.875 --> 51:29.919
He'll say one thing and
then he'll—— you know what

51:29.920 --> 51:32.589
forget it. I can't do this.

51:32.590 --> 51:34.215
- What do you mean?

51:34.216 --> 51:37.386
Who am I to tell you what to believe?

51:38.887 --> 51:40.306
But you know this stuff.

51:41.390 --> 51:43.308
I never believed it.

51:43.309 --> 51:44.184
None of it.

51:44.185 --> 51:46.312
I talked about god all the time

51:48.230 --> 51:51.190
'cause I was just one
of those false teachers

51:51.191 --> 51:54.111
that the Bible says that will
show up in the last days.

51:55.195 --> 51:57.030
We both made mistakes, Bruce.

51:57.031 --> 51:58.532
So how about we unmake them?

52:03.746 --> 52:08.167
Look, I think we both believe this now.

52:09.543 --> 52:11.753
We missed our chance,
but so did everyone else

52:11.754 --> 52:13.504
who's still here.

52:13.505 --> 52:15.882
They need to know the truth.

52:15.883 --> 52:17.051
- Look around.

52:18.010 --> 52:21.888
No one comes here. No
one's been here in months.

52:21.889 --> 52:23.891
They don't want the truth.

52:25.601 --> 52:26.602
- One of them might.

52:30.606 --> 52:31.690
That should be enough.

52:34.276 --> 52:35.276
You're right.

52:43.827 --> 52:44.828
Start with this.

52:46.121 --> 52:48.873
Hello, my name is Vernon billings

52:48.874 --> 52:52.001
and I'm the lead pastor
at new hope church.

52:52.002 --> 52:55.838
I'm recording this as a message
for all those left behind

52:55.839 --> 52:57.965
after the return of Christ in the air

52:57.966 --> 53:00.761
to call his church home in the rapture.

53:01.845 --> 53:05.056
For all of you who lost
loved ones among the millions

53:05.057 --> 53:09.977
that vanished, please be
assured they are fine.

53:09.978 --> 53:12.689
You have my word on that.

53:12.690 --> 53:14.774
Are you trying to scare me?

53:14.775 --> 53:15.817
Perhaps, Chloe.

53:15.818 --> 53:17.610
Perhaps Chloe what?

53:17.611 --> 53:20.363
Needs everything sugar coated for her?

53:20.364 --> 53:23.449
I think that's what got her
here in the first place.

53:23.450 --> 53:25.536
- — I'm sorry.
- You should be.

53:26.745 --> 53:30.373
Don't you act all tough
with me, Chloe Steele.

53:30.374 --> 53:34.127
I had a mama who worshiped the drink

53:34.128 --> 53:38.005
and turfed me out on the street at 12.

53:38.006 --> 53:39.716
Okay, what exactly did I do?

53:39.717 --> 53:42.511
Do? Oh, I'm so glad
you asked that question.

53:43.345 --> 53:47.098
Your mom was a friend of mine
and she made it her mission

53:47.099 --> 53:50.601
to ensure that we all know
the answer to the question

53:50.602 --> 53:52.271
that everybody's asking now.

53:53.397 --> 53:55.398
I just never thought I would see

53:55.399 --> 53:59.778
the daughter of Irene Steele left behind.

54:01.029 --> 54:02.029
- I see.

54:05.409 --> 54:08.245
So if you both listened to my mom

54:10.038 --> 54:11.415
and why are you still here?

54:12.916 --> 54:17.921
Oh, child! You in it now. [Chuckles]

54:19.840 --> 54:23.843
The apostle Paul wrote
to the church at corinth.

54:23.844 --> 54:27.555
Behold, I tell you a mystery.

54:27.556 --> 54:29.599
We shall not all sleep,

54:29.600 --> 54:34.605
but shall be changed in a moment
in the twinkling of an eye.

54:36.607 --> 54:40.693
Unfortunately, if you are
watching this after the rapture,

54:40.694 --> 54:45.699
then you are either in or soon
to be in a seven year period

54:45.824 --> 54:47.700
of darkness, tribulation,

54:47.701 --> 54:50.662
and terror like the world has never seen.

54:52.039 --> 54:55.291
Please, I beg you,

54:55.292 --> 54:58.711
abandon your self-centered ideals.

54:58.712 --> 55:03.674
No matter what you have to face
on earth, it's not too late.

55:03.675 --> 55:06.386
You can still spend eternity in heaven,

55:08.847 --> 55:12.767
turn to the Bible, turn to god.

55:12.768 --> 55:15.895
Not because you have no other choice,

55:15.896 --> 55:18.440
but because this is the right choice.

55:20.025 --> 55:22.944
Turn to god, I beg you.

55:22.945 --> 55:26.323
Take this opportunity
and embrace these words.

55:27.282 --> 55:28.367
Get on your knees

55:29.409 --> 55:31.578
and thank god for this second chance.

55:41.046 --> 55:43.005
[Bruce] Ray knew that
studying Bible prophecy

55:43.006 --> 55:44.298
was not enough.

55:44.299 --> 55:46.467
Heck, I was living proof of that.

55:46.468 --> 55:48.719
I knew that stuff inside out.

55:48.720 --> 55:50.763
I could have written a
book about the rapture,

55:50.764 --> 55:52.723
and yet there I was.

55:52.724 --> 55:56.143
The gift of salvation is
free. You can't earn it.

55:56.144 --> 55:57.728
You can't deserve it.

55:57.729 --> 56:00.940
You just have to ask and receive.

56:00.941 --> 56:03.192
I'd have laughed if you
told me that one day,

56:03.193 --> 56:06.196
rayford steel would be
leading me to the altar.

56:07.239 --> 56:08.657
Thank you, Jesus.

56:12.995 --> 56:15.162
I want you to repeat these words

56:15.163 --> 56:18.792
and to think about each
word as you say it.

56:19.710 --> 56:23.129
Lord Jesus, I know I am a sinner.

56:23.130 --> 56:26.048
[Both] Lord Jesus, know I'm a sinner.

56:26.049 --> 56:28.968
But I also know that you have offered me

56:28.969 --> 56:32.096
the gift of your forgiveness.

56:32.097 --> 56:34.432
[Both] But I also know you've offered me

56:34.433 --> 56:35.766
the gift of your forgiveness.

56:35.767 --> 56:37.394
- You gave your life for me,

56:38.228 --> 56:40.980
and then Rose from the
dead on the third day.

56:40.981 --> 56:43.107
[Both] You gave your life for me,

56:43.108 --> 56:45.610
and then Rose from the
dead on the third day.

56:45.611 --> 56:49.656
I gratefully accept
your offer of salvation.

56:50.741 --> 56:53.868
[Both] I gratefully accept
your offer of salvation.

56:53.869 --> 56:58.874
- Please, lord, come into my
heart as my lord and savior.

56:59.333 --> 57:02.376
[Both] Please, lord, come
into my heart as my lord

57:02.377 --> 57:03.377
and savior.

57:05.088 --> 57:09.009
- Thank you Jesus. Amen.

57:13.138 --> 57:14.138
Amen.

57:15.807 --> 57:16.974
Well, what about the main server?

57:16.975 --> 57:18.017
Any luck?

57:18.018 --> 57:20.770
No way. Not without password.

57:20.771 --> 57:22.189
Well, keep trying anyway.

57:25.943 --> 57:27.736
Come on. Come on, come on.

57:29.655 --> 57:30.655
Ah—huh.

57:39.206 --> 57:43.292
[Suspenseful music]
[Phone ringing]

57:43.293 --> 57:44.670
- Hey, Chloe, where are you?

57:46.546 --> 57:48.507
I didn't even know that
place was still running.

57:49.841 --> 57:51.468
Oh, no, no, I'm fine, I'm fine.

57:53.053 --> 57:55.471
I just wanted to talk to about something.

57:55.472 --> 57:58.099
I know you might not be ready for this,

57:58.100 --> 57:59.684
but I saw something today

57:59.685 --> 58:02.437
and I really want you to see it too.

58:04.272 --> 58:05.774
Well, what if it is about god?

58:06.650 --> 58:07.650
I mean, what does-

58:08.443 --> 58:09.736
Chloe, please?

58:14.116 --> 58:15.158
Okay. Yeah. Fine.

58:17.202 --> 58:18.328
I'll call you tomorrow.

58:20.080 --> 58:21.123
Yeah, I love you too.

58:24.876 --> 58:27.587
Don't you think your dad
would wanna know you got hurt?

58:29.089 --> 58:31.799
- I need a doctor, not a priest.

58:31.800 --> 58:34.970
Girl, you need to honor thy father.

59:23.894 --> 59:25.061
Okay. What is this?

59:25.062 --> 59:26.520
What do you want?

59:26.521 --> 59:31.526
[Phone chimes]
[Suspenseful music]

59:42.412 --> 59:44.998
[Upbeat music]

59:54.382 --> 59:57.010
[Laptop chimes]

59:58.595 --> 01:00:01.389
Yes. [Chuckles]

01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:10.147
- Hi, ray.

01:00:10.148 --> 01:00:11.441
Hattie. — how are you?

01:00:14.402 --> 01:00:15.402
I'm good.

01:00:17.656 --> 01:00:20.074
So, please, I'm sorry.

01:00:20.075 --> 01:00:21.535
Why don't you come on inside.

01:00:22.994 --> 01:00:25.162
I'm so glad to see that you're all right.

01:00:25.163 --> 01:00:27.039
Oh yeah. I mean, I'm
better than all right.

01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:28.624
It's been good.

01:00:28.625 --> 01:00:30.043
Oh yeah.

01:00:31.878 --> 01:00:33.754
- Just really wanted to see you.

01:00:33.755 --> 01:00:34.964
I've been thinking so much about you

01:00:34.965 --> 01:00:36.757
and I've been thinking about us.

01:00:36.758 --> 01:00:38.551
Yeah, I meant to call but...

01:00:38.552 --> 01:00:40.345
It's okay. You don't owe me an apology.

01:00:42.472 --> 01:00:43.722
- Can I get you a drink or something?

01:00:43.723 --> 01:00:45.224
I would love one, thanks.

01:00:45.225 --> 01:00:46.934
What can I get you?

01:00:46.935 --> 01:00:48.186
Whatever you're having.

01:00:50.105 --> 01:00:51.106
I left the airline.

01:00:52.649 --> 01:00:55.151
Really? To do what?

01:00:55.152 --> 01:00:56.861
- I got a job at the UN.

01:00:56.862 --> 01:00:58.863
I'm gonna be working with
the Romanian ambassador,

01:00:58.864 --> 01:01:00.823
nicolae carpathia.

01:01:00.824 --> 01:01:03.742
Wow. I mean, that sounds great.

01:01:03.743 --> 01:01:06.120
I mean, it could be
great for both of us.

01:01:06.121 --> 01:01:08.539
The UN is having trouble getting
negotiators and diplomatic

01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:11.001
teams out fast enough, and
they're short on pilots.

01:01:11.918 --> 01:01:13.753
- Oh. Oh.

01:01:15.088 --> 01:01:16.922
I'm not looking for a job, but thanks.

01:01:16.923 --> 01:01:18.716
- Seriously, I mean,
they're paying so well,

01:01:18.717 --> 01:01:21.051
you'll help the world
get back on its feet.

01:01:21.052 --> 01:01:22.845
I mean, not to mention you'll
have an amazing coworker

01:01:22.846 --> 01:01:24.472
with a lot of benefits.

01:01:25.932 --> 01:01:30.270
Hattie, I can't.

01:01:39.362 --> 01:01:42.281
You gotta stop living in the past, ray,

01:01:42.282 --> 01:01:44.658
you have to stop worrying
about the vanishings.

01:01:44.659 --> 01:01:46.202
Those weren't vanishings.

01:01:46.203 --> 01:01:48.704
It was a rapture, just like
I told you on the plane

01:01:48.705 --> 01:01:49.539
the night that it happened.

01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:50.540
It wasn't the rapture.

01:01:50.541 --> 01:01:53.083
The rapture was debunked on the first day.

01:01:53.084 --> 01:01:55.253
And there's been more
vanishings since then.

01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:58.964
- Do you know anyone who's
gone in the second wave?

01:01:58.965 --> 01:02:00.341
Not personally.

01:02:00.342 --> 01:02:02.635
- It's because the
raptures weren't debunked

01:02:02.636 --> 01:02:04.970
but someone on TV told you
that they were debunked

01:02:04.971 --> 01:02:07.474
and you just accepted it.

01:02:11.561 --> 01:02:13.688
What almost happened between us?

01:02:15.857 --> 01:02:17.983
It doesn't matter now.

01:02:17.984 --> 01:02:19.568
Well, did I ever matter?

01:02:19.569 --> 01:02:21.695
That that's not what I meant.

01:02:21.696 --> 01:02:25.491
Hattie, I've accepted Jesus
Christ as my lord and savior.

01:02:25.492 --> 01:02:26.909
And please trust me on this.

01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:28.787
You cannot find the truth without him.

01:02:33.959 --> 01:02:36.877
I really should have
suspected that you'd take

01:02:36.878 --> 01:02:37.963
the coward's way out.

01:02:38.922 --> 01:02:40.965
You didn't feel guilty
when your wife was here,

01:02:40.966 --> 01:02:42.716
but now you feel guilty that she's gone.

01:02:42.717 --> 01:02:44.301
And so you're running
to god for forgiveness.

01:02:44.302 --> 01:02:46.846
And I mean, who cares who you
hurt along the way, right?

01:02:48.556 --> 01:02:53.561
If I hurt you, I'm sorry, I really am.

01:02:54.688 --> 01:02:57.273
But accepting Christ is not cowardly.

01:02:57.274 --> 01:03:00.276
It's far from it.

01:03:00.277 --> 01:03:01.319
What was cowardly?

01:03:02.612 --> 01:03:04.196
It was being too afraid of the truth

01:03:04.197 --> 01:03:06.449
to even want to hear it.

01:03:18.712 --> 01:03:19.712
- Goodbye, ray.

01:03:27.387 --> 01:03:28.847
[Door slams]

01:03:35.437 --> 01:03:36.937
[Buck] Hey. — I got in.

01:03:36.938 --> 01:03:40.399
- [Buck] Seriously?
- — yeah. And it's insane.

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:43.277
I mean, it's gonna take some
time, but this thing is huge.

01:03:43.278 --> 01:03:44.945
I mean, the biggest single
program I've ever seen,

01:03:44.946 --> 01:03:46.989
maybe a hundred million lines of code.

01:03:46.990 --> 01:03:48.282
- [Buck] So what are you saying?

01:03:48.283 --> 01:03:50.409
I'm saying that this is more
than some kind of electronic

01:03:50.410 --> 01:03:51.744
pay app.

01:03:51.745 --> 01:03:52.953
How'd you get in?

01:03:52.954 --> 01:03:54.288
- Let's just say someone on the inside

01:03:54.289 --> 01:03:56.457
thinks the world needs to see this.

01:03:56.458 --> 01:03:57.458
And so do you.

01:03:58.877 --> 01:04:01.629
[Dramatic music]

01:04:04.924 --> 01:04:07.593
[People applauding]

01:04:07.594 --> 01:04:08.844
Well, Megan, as you can see,

01:04:08.845 --> 01:04:11.180
this place is going absolutely crazy.

01:04:11.181 --> 01:04:13.766
As we anticipate the
arrival of united nation's

01:04:13.767 --> 01:04:16.518
peace spin on nicolae carpathia.

01:04:16.519 --> 01:04:18.645
This is the kind of reception
you might have expected

01:04:18.646 --> 01:04:21.190
for a movie star, but for a politician,

01:04:21.191 --> 01:04:24.151
I haven't seen anything
like this since Obama.

01:04:24.152 --> 01:04:26.070
I mean, listen to that crowd

01:04:26.071 --> 01:04:27.821
after all the incredible work he did

01:04:27.822 --> 01:04:29.656
in Romania after the vanishings,

01:04:29.657 --> 01:04:31.658
the world is looking for
someone they can trust

01:04:31.659 --> 01:04:33.577
to get us all back on track.

01:04:33.578 --> 01:04:35.287
And I'm not sure there's
been a world leader

01:04:35.288 --> 01:04:37.956
who has earned that
trust more than this man.

01:04:37.957 --> 01:04:40.752
[People shouting]

01:04:43.213 --> 01:04:44.464
- Anyone see you come in.

01:04:45.590 --> 01:04:47.758
I took the stairs. What'd you find?

01:04:47.759 --> 01:04:50.469
I gotta look inside
the Eden pay platform.

01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:53.138
And it's a whole lot more
than a glorified bank card.

01:04:53.139 --> 01:04:55.724
In fact, the whole
financial part is maybe 10%.

01:04:55.725 --> 01:04:56.975
What's the rest of it?

01:04:56.976 --> 01:04:58.894
Combination of things.

01:04:58.895 --> 01:05:03.858
Surveillance, tracking, biometric
reporting, social credit.

01:05:04.818 --> 01:05:07.236
I mean, they may be planning
to start with the money,

01:05:07.237 --> 01:05:09.071
but whoever has control over this system

01:05:09.072 --> 01:05:11.365
has control over the whole
world and everyone in it.

01:05:11.366 --> 01:05:13.575
- Well, you said social credit,

01:05:13.576 --> 01:05:15.494
which means they're gonna
force you to either conform

01:05:15.495 --> 01:05:16.662
or be kicked out of the system.

01:05:16.663 --> 01:05:19.164
Yeah, and if you lose
access to Eden pay,

01:05:19.165 --> 01:05:20.625
then you can't even buy food.

01:05:21.584 --> 01:05:23.627
And you're gonna pretend
like it's not mandatory.

01:05:23.628 --> 01:05:25.504
Act like we actually have a choice.

01:05:25.505 --> 01:05:27.673
Download the app or starve to death.

01:05:27.674 --> 01:05:29.550
Pretty powerful marketing campaign.

01:05:29.551 --> 01:05:32.719
Yeah, my guy on the inside
says he has the smoking gun

01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:34.721
that connects all this
and a whole lot more

01:05:34.722 --> 01:05:38.725
directly to stonagal, and
he's willing to hand it over.

01:05:38.726 --> 01:05:39.726
- Do you trust him?

01:05:41.229 --> 01:05:43.105
- He says, I have to agree to
make the whole thing public.

01:05:43.106 --> 01:05:45.858
He even wants to do a
media interview to document

01:05:45.859 --> 01:05:46.734
the evidence.

01:05:46.735 --> 01:05:49.028
So, it seems like he's on our team.

01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:51.656
Well, he's our only lead.

01:05:52.782 --> 01:05:53.950
I say we go for it.

01:05:55.827 --> 01:05:57.411
I don't think you should go.

01:05:57.412 --> 01:05:58.662
No? — think about it.

01:05:58.663 --> 01:06:01.540
If this is the FBI or CIA or whatever,

01:06:01.541 --> 01:06:04.001
if this is a setup for my hacking,

01:06:04.002 --> 01:06:04.836
then they've got both of us

01:06:04.837 --> 01:06:06.379
and the story dies right there.

01:06:08.131 --> 01:06:09.131
Let me go.

01:06:10.758 --> 01:06:12.217
I'll bring a cameraman.

01:06:12.218 --> 01:06:15.179
We'll tape the interview
and then you run it.

01:06:15.180 --> 01:06:17.055
What if you get arrested?

01:06:17.056 --> 01:06:19.516
Well, then you still have all this.

01:06:19.517 --> 01:06:20.934
Hopefully, it'll still
be enough to blow the lid

01:06:20.935 --> 01:06:22.020
off the Eden hoax.

01:06:23.813 --> 01:06:25.607
- Okay. Yeah, let's do it.

01:06:30.195 --> 01:06:33.198
[People chattering]

01:06:36.451 --> 01:06:37.285
Where is he?

01:06:37.286 --> 01:06:38.952
- Closed door meeting since I got in,

01:06:38.953 --> 01:06:40.704
haven't heard him yell once.

01:06:40.705 --> 01:06:41.705
Something's up.

01:06:42.582 --> 01:06:43.874
Getty images went with the one

01:06:43.875 --> 01:06:45.959
where I'm interviewing carpathia.

01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:47.212
It's going global.

01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:51.131
I swear she's trying to take my job.

01:06:51.132 --> 01:06:52.466
Obviously.

01:06:52.467 --> 01:06:55.010
- Okay, so I found a
treasure trove of evidence

01:06:55.011 --> 01:06:55.887
to Bury this guy.

01:06:55.888 --> 01:06:58.430
And I mean, I'm talking
atomic level bombshells here.

01:06:58.431 --> 01:07:00.432
Ooh. Gimme, gimme, gimme.

01:07:00.433 --> 01:07:02.226
- Have Sam run search to the archives.

01:07:02.227 --> 01:07:04.770
Anything related to dominator analytics

01:07:04.771 --> 01:07:06.271
have her start back about two years or so.

01:07:06.272 --> 01:07:07.940
Then take a look at those files.

01:07:07.941 --> 01:07:09.942
Then you can see what I'm talking about.

01:07:09.943 --> 01:07:11.401
I'm on it.

01:07:11.402 --> 01:07:13.070
- [Carpathia] We have
a couple of more time.

01:07:13.071 --> 01:07:16.823
A world of nations and
states, a divided world.

01:07:16.824 --> 01:07:21.495
But at the heart of it all, we
are still a world, one world,

01:07:21.496 --> 01:07:23.331
one people, one future

01:07:24.290 --> 01:07:26.708
and it's not just a hopeful mantra.

01:07:26.709 --> 01:07:29.086
That is the only way
fonnard and the only way

01:07:29.087 --> 01:07:33.006
to ensure the survival,
not only of our species,

01:07:33.007 --> 01:07:35.551
but of this incredible
planet that grew and evolved

01:07:35.552 --> 01:07:38.428
against incredible odds
into this marvelous place

01:07:38.429 --> 01:07:39.681
that we call home.

01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:44.017
Progress is not something
that happens gradually.

01:07:44.018 --> 01:07:47.563
It comes in fits and starts,
sometimes for the better,

01:07:47.564 --> 01:07:49.481
sometimes for the worse.

01:07:49.482 --> 01:07:52.359
So it is absolutely
critical that we utilize

01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:55.280
the opportunities that
existential crises offer us.

01:07:56.197 --> 01:07:57.282
It's Erica Miller.

01:07:58.825 --> 01:08:00.659
Get me someone from dominator analytics.

01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:04.038
This word crisis is
represented by two characters.

01:08:04.956 --> 01:08:09.585
Taken separately, those
two characters mean danger

01:08:09.586 --> 01:08:10.670
and opportunity.

01:08:11.879 --> 01:08:14.047
I don't think I could
have been more clear, buck.

01:08:14.048 --> 01:08:15.215
- You said I was speculating.

01:08:15.216 --> 01:08:16.966
So I brought you back proof this time.

01:08:16.968 --> 01:08:18.468
This?

01:08:18.469 --> 01:08:19.511
This isn't proof.

01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:22.139
Well, there's a lot more.

01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:23.140
Where?

01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:24.017
It's coming.

01:08:24.017 --> 01:08:25.017
And your source?

01:08:25.810 --> 01:08:29.020
You know, I can't do that,
but I know him and I trust him.

01:08:29.022 --> 01:08:30.731
- Oh, but you don't trust me.

01:08:30.732 --> 01:08:33.191
I know who it is. It's
that crazy professor, huh?

01:08:33.192 --> 01:08:37.696
Who thinks that 9/11 was
a false flag operation?

01:08:37.697 --> 01:08:39.906
You know what? It's your choice Steve.

01:08:39.907 --> 01:08:42.408
But I'm green—lighting this
story with or without you.

01:08:42.410 --> 01:08:44.578
It's not that simple.
This isn'tjust about me.

01:08:44.578 --> 01:08:47.788
- So then call corporate,
talk to the vp of censorship.

01:08:47.790 --> 01:08:49.207
See what they say.

01:08:49.207 --> 01:08:51.042
Let's see if they really
care about the narrative

01:08:51.044 --> 01:08:53.795
or if they care more about
having the biggest cable

01:08:53.796 --> 01:08:55.964
audience on news TV.

01:08:55.965 --> 01:08:57.424
It's what you said, the numbers, right?

01:08:57.425 --> 01:09:00.636
I mean, ratings, advertisers.

01:09:00.636 --> 01:09:01.804
Come on, man.

01:09:06.309 --> 01:09:07.143
- Hey, dad.

01:09:07.144 --> 01:09:09.394
Hey, Chloe, are are
you still at the hospice?

01:09:09.395 --> 01:09:10.270
Yeah.

01:09:10.272 --> 01:09:11.438
- I need you to come and see me.

01:09:11.439 --> 01:09:12.856
There's something I wanna show you.

01:09:12.857 --> 01:09:14.316
I can't come home right now, dad.

01:09:14.317 --> 01:09:15.734
No, I'm not at home.

01:09:15.734 --> 01:09:17.319
I'm at new home.

01:09:17.319 --> 01:09:18.779
- You're at the church right now. Why?

01:09:18.779 --> 01:09:19.613
Yeah. Yeah.

01:09:19.615 --> 01:09:22.448
Well, I, look, I found something.

01:09:22.450 --> 01:09:25.452
It's the answers. Pastor
Barnes is here and-

01:09:25.453 --> 01:09:26.745
well, maybe that
should tell you something

01:09:26.746 --> 01:09:28.121
if the pastor's still here.

01:09:28.122 --> 01:09:29.747
No, no, it's not what you think.

01:09:29.749 --> 01:09:31.750
And look, look, if you could
just give him a chance and he-

01:09:31.751 --> 01:09:35.921
look, I'm kind of
tied up here right now,

01:09:35.921 --> 01:09:37.839
and I'm really not in the mood for church.

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:41.051
So I'll talk to you later.

01:09:41.051 --> 01:09:42.678
Say hi to pastor Bruce for me..

01:09:42.679 --> 01:09:43.679
- Yeah, but...

01:09:46.808 --> 01:09:49.893
Amanda, get my chair
and pull the Van around,

01:09:49.894 --> 01:09:51.228
there's an emergency.

01:09:51.229 --> 01:09:53.689
Fern. What is it?

01:09:53.689 --> 01:09:56.233
- I wanna be baptized at your church.

01:09:56.234 --> 01:09:58.820
I heard rumors pastor Barnes is available.

01:10:00.196 --> 01:10:02.115
Alright. Alright.

01:10:04.158 --> 01:10:04.992
Okay, you know what,

01:10:04.993 --> 01:10:07.536
if you're too scared to find
out what's actually going on,

01:10:07.537 --> 01:10:09.162
then I'll just do it without your help.

01:10:09.163 --> 01:10:10.163
- No, you won't.

01:10:11.165 --> 01:10:12.833
What do you mean? No, I won't.

01:10:12.834 --> 01:10:16.002
What I mean is you will
not pursue it. Period.

01:10:16.003 --> 01:10:19.214
As in you are done. Your
show has been canceled.

01:10:19.215 --> 01:10:20.674
Effective immediately.

01:10:20.675 --> 01:10:22.259
- Are you seriously threatening to cancel

01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:24.845
the number one rated news show at gwn

01:10:24.846 --> 01:10:26.388
because I want to cover a story.

01:10:26.389 --> 01:10:28.098
It's not a threat. It's already done.

01:10:28.099 --> 01:10:30.851
And believe me, like I
said, this is way beyond me.

01:10:30.852 --> 01:10:32.018
This is corporate.

01:10:32.019 --> 01:10:36.690
We have had a surge of complaints
about your divisiveness.

01:10:36.691 --> 01:10:37.734
Divisiveness?

01:10:39.944 --> 01:10:43.697
- You've become a symbol
of mistrust of division

01:10:43.698 --> 01:10:44.615
for the people.

01:10:44.616 --> 01:10:48.201
And it's one conspiracy
after the other conspiracy,

01:10:48.202 --> 01:10:50.954
conspiracy, your buyout is being papered.

01:10:50.955 --> 01:10:52.122
It'll be delivered to you tomorrow.

01:10:52.123 --> 01:10:53.999
In the meantime, I
suggest that you go home

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.459
and get some rest.

01:10:55.460 --> 01:10:58.463
And these fine gentlemen
will show you out.

01:11:10.057 --> 01:11:11.308
Oh, hey, ray.

01:11:11.309 --> 01:11:13.477
- These flyers are great.

01:11:13.478 --> 01:11:15.604
I mean, there's boxes of them back there.

01:11:15.605 --> 01:11:17.481
Pastor billings had
those printed a while ago.

01:11:17.482 --> 01:11:18.732
I had nothing to do with that.

01:11:18.733 --> 01:11:19.900
- Yeah, but they explain
everything that's going on

01:11:19.901 --> 01:11:20.818
in the world right now.

01:11:20.819 --> 01:11:23.111
We should be handing
these out to everyone.

01:11:23.112 --> 01:11:24.529
No. No.

01:11:24.530 --> 01:11:26.490
- Come on, we'll do a service.

01:11:26.491 --> 01:11:27.866
No to a service. — yes.

01:11:27.867 --> 01:11:28.950
You and I know what's going on,

01:11:28.951 --> 01:11:30.368
what's really going on here?

01:11:30.369 --> 01:11:32.288
We can't just sit here and do nothing.

01:11:33.372 --> 01:11:34.372
Hi.

01:11:35.583 --> 01:11:38.169
Hey, Chloe. It's good to see you.

01:11:39.128 --> 01:11:40.670
- Pastor Bruce Barnes.

01:11:40.671 --> 01:11:41.797
Yes, I'm Bruce.

01:11:41.798 --> 01:11:43.799
Well, I hope you don't mind, pastor,

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:45.760
but we have some questions for you.

01:11:46.844 --> 01:11:48.220
Well come on in.

01:11:48.221 --> 01:11:49.555
I hope I have some answers.

01:11:56.687 --> 01:11:58.438
I may have something.

01:11:58.439 --> 01:12:02.026
There are three dates and
times in this line of code.

01:12:02.860 --> 01:12:05.111
The first is the day everyone vanished,

01:12:05.112 --> 01:12:07.656
the second is yesterday, the
day of the new vanishings

01:12:07.657 --> 01:12:11.451
and the the third is two days from now.

01:12:11.452 --> 01:12:12.494
- So what does that mean?

01:12:12.495 --> 01:12:13.371
I don't know.

01:12:13.372 --> 01:12:15.664
But the code itself was
written three days before

01:12:15.665 --> 01:12:16.916
the new vanishings.

01:12:18.292 --> 01:12:19.752
- So they knew beforehand.

01:12:22.046 --> 01:12:23.380
How is that even possible?

01:12:23.381 --> 01:12:25.215
Well, I don't know.

01:12:25.216 --> 01:12:28.718
Either they knew something
that the rest of us didn't

01:12:28.719 --> 01:12:31.055
or they weren't involved
in the vanishings.

01:12:31.931 --> 01:12:34.224
There's a third option.

01:12:34.225 --> 01:12:37.310
What if the new vanishings never happened.

01:12:37.311 --> 01:12:39.229
The numbers are pretty
high for it to be rumors.

01:12:39.230 --> 01:12:40.438
No, I know it sounds crazy,

01:12:40.439 --> 01:12:44.234
but I don't know anybody who
knows anybody who disappeared.

01:12:44.235 --> 01:12:45.318
Do you?

01:12:45.319 --> 01:12:46.570
Yes, sure, it's all over the news,

01:12:46.571 --> 01:12:48.155
but it's always somewhere else.

01:12:49.657 --> 01:12:51.491
Try something for me.

01:12:51.492 --> 01:12:54.870
Go back into the Eden system.
Type these three names.

01:12:54.871 --> 01:12:59.375
Michael Parker, Jess
Walker, and Aaron Hewitt.

01:13:01.252 --> 01:13:02.544
- So who are these?

01:13:02.545 --> 01:13:04.671
- They disappeared in
the second vanishing.

01:13:04.672 --> 01:13:05.548
Okay.

01:13:05.549 --> 01:13:08.091
There are several documents
with all three names in them.

01:13:08.092 --> 01:13:11.344
This is an an email that was part of

01:13:11.345 --> 01:13:13.848
an internal memo sent
in the it department.

01:13:15.224 --> 01:13:17.434
Wait, this memo was sent
before the second vanishings

01:13:17.435 --> 01:13:18.435
were reported?

01:13:19.395 --> 01:13:20.396
- Over a week ago.

01:13:21.939 --> 01:13:24.190
That's it. That's our answer.

01:13:24.191 --> 01:13:27.944
It was faked. My guess is these
people never even existed.

01:13:27.945 --> 01:13:30.280
We need to see your guy
and I'm coming with you.

01:13:30.281 --> 01:13:31.865
This might be my last
chance to talk to him

01:13:31.866 --> 01:13:33.826
before words gets out that I lost my show.

01:13:34.785 --> 01:13:36.162
- Wait, you lost your show?

01:13:39.832 --> 01:13:41.083
- My guys should be here.

01:13:57.350 --> 01:13:59.893
Connor, thanks for doing this, man.

01:13:59.894 --> 01:14:00.936
Yeah, thanks for thinking of me.

01:14:00.937 --> 01:14:02.562
- Of course.

01:14:02.563 --> 01:14:04.147
Hey, look, I wanna make sure that we do

01:14:04.148 --> 01:14:06.942
a real time upload of the
interview to the cloud

01:14:06.943 --> 01:14:08.401
to make sure we don't lose anything, okay?

01:14:08.402 --> 01:14:10.654
Okay.
— dirk, Connor. Connor, dirk.

01:14:10.655 --> 01:14:11.489
Hey Connor.

01:14:11.490 --> 01:14:12.573
Nice to meet you.

01:14:13.449 --> 01:14:14.908
Have everything you need?

01:14:14.909 --> 01:14:16.785
- Yeah, lemme just double check this box.

01:14:16.786 --> 01:14:18.078
Make sure I have the right cable.

01:14:18.079 --> 01:14:19.538
- I have eyes on the vehicle.

01:14:20.498 --> 01:14:21.999
Both targets confirmed.

01:14:23.918 --> 01:14:24.918
Yes sir.

01:14:26.253 --> 01:14:27.587
- We have a couple more bags.

01:14:27.588 --> 01:14:28.630
Would you mind putting the seats down?

01:14:28.631 --> 01:14:29.840
You got it. — thanks.

01:14:31.342 --> 01:14:32.718
Two or three. — yeah.

01:14:38.557 --> 01:14:40.725
- It's a bomb, run, run, run.

01:14:40.726 --> 01:14:43.396
[Bomb explodes]

01:14:52.613 --> 01:14:55.366
[Both screaming]

01:14:58.452 --> 01:15:01.830
What about all the evidence
debunking the rapture theory?

01:15:01.831 --> 01:15:05.417
Lots of christians still here,
lots of non—christian gone.

01:15:05.418 --> 01:15:07.836
And don't forget this didn't
happen in the twinkling of

01:15:07.837 --> 01:15:08.713
an eye.

01:15:08.714 --> 01:15:10.256
In fact, it's still happening now.

01:15:11.257 --> 01:15:12.257
They're lying.

01:15:13.134 --> 01:15:14.175
Who's lying?

01:15:14.176 --> 01:15:16.302
Anyone who tells you
this wasn't a rupture?

01:15:16.303 --> 01:15:17.179
That's who.

01:15:17.180 --> 01:15:20.890
When the disciples asked
Jesus on the mount of olives

01:15:20.891 --> 01:15:23.059
what life would be like in the last days,

01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:27.439
his first words were, take
heed that no man deceive you.

01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:29.108
- So how do we know who we can trust?

01:15:30.151 --> 01:15:33.403
Trust god. Trust Jesus.

01:15:33.404 --> 01:15:34.946
Trust the Bible.

01:15:34.947 --> 01:15:36.698
And for literally everyone else,

01:15:36.699 --> 01:15:39.951
take what they're saying to
you and Wade against the word.

01:15:39.952 --> 01:15:43.455
And then you pray, pray.

01:15:43.456 --> 01:15:47.625
Pray for god's help not to be led astray.

01:15:47.626 --> 01:15:51.546
So if this is the rapture,

01:15:51.547 --> 01:15:53.423
then what happens to the rest of us

01:15:53.424 --> 01:15:55.341
who didn't make the cut?

01:15:55.342 --> 01:15:58.428
Well, hopefully we survive tribulation.

01:15:58.429 --> 01:16:00.305
That's what the rapture was all about.

01:16:00.306 --> 01:16:03.391
Jesus taking his church
to heaven to protect them

01:16:03.392 --> 01:16:04.434
from what is to come.

01:16:04.435 --> 01:16:06.269
And what is that, exactly?

01:16:06.270 --> 01:16:08.271
Well, we don't wanna
go into the gory details,

01:16:08.272 --> 01:16:09.148
let's just fo-

01:16:09.148 --> 01:16:10.148
no, I wanna know.

01:16:11.984 --> 01:16:16.029
When it is all over half
the world will be dead.

01:16:16.030 --> 01:16:17.197
Wow.

01:16:17.198 --> 01:16:19.949
So I don't know whether
to be more afraid of god

01:16:19.950 --> 01:16:21.117
or the anti—christ.

01:16:21.118 --> 01:16:22.535
- God, definitely.

01:16:22.536 --> 01:16:25.205
You can hide from the anti—christ.

01:16:25.206 --> 01:16:28.291
What about all the people
who claim that the rapture

01:16:28.292 --> 01:16:29.502
isn't even in the Bible?

01:16:30.586 --> 01:16:32.088
Can you show me where it is?

01:16:35.758 --> 01:16:38.636
1st thessalonians chapter 4,

01:16:39.804 --> 01:16:44.307
"for the lord shall descend
from heaven with a shout

01:16:44.308 --> 01:16:46.684
with the voice of the arch angel,

01:16:46.685 --> 01:16:49.312
and the dead in Christ shall rise first,

01:16:49.313 --> 01:16:52.607
then we which are alive and
remain shall be gathered up

01:16:52.608 --> 01:16:56.486
with them in the clouds to
meet our lord in the air.

01:16:56.487 --> 01:16:59.322
And so shall I ever be with the lord...

01:16:59.323 --> 01:17:00.574
- Sounds good to me.

01:17:02.243 --> 01:17:06.831
I can't wait to see my dear
departed George waiting for me.

01:17:08.916 --> 01:17:10.208
I'll be back tonight.

01:17:10.209 --> 01:17:11.209
Where you going?

01:17:12.044 --> 01:17:14.754
- Just have an old friend
I need to check on.

01:17:14.755 --> 01:17:17.758
[Suspenseful music]

01:17:24.265 --> 01:17:25.182
Well, I don't understand.

01:17:25.183 --> 01:17:27.268
Why wouldn't you support the Eden project?

01:17:28.394 --> 01:17:30.812
First off, I love the technology.

01:17:30.813 --> 01:17:33.148
I mean, you've done a brilliantjob.

01:17:33.149 --> 01:17:35.108
It's incredibly intuitive.

01:17:35.109 --> 01:17:37.777
Any man or woman, almost
anywhere in the world

01:17:37.778 --> 01:17:40.488
will master it almost
from the first touch.

01:17:40.489 --> 01:17:41.407
Brilliant.

01:17:41.408 --> 01:17:43.575
- Much appreciated nicolae.

01:17:43.576 --> 01:17:45.535
- And you, Jonathan,

01:17:45.536 --> 01:17:49.330
for your foresight and financial
backing to make it happen.

01:17:49.331 --> 01:17:50.707
Without you.

01:17:50.708 --> 01:17:52.501
None of this would've been possible.

01:17:55.171 --> 01:17:56.754
Chaim, if you could
give us a minute, please.

01:17:56.755 --> 01:17:57.755
- Of course.

01:18:00.301 --> 01:18:02.510
I know it all sounds a little scary.

01:18:02.511 --> 01:18:04.220
A little scary?

01:18:04.221 --> 01:18:06.764
Then what would a lot scary sound like?

01:18:06.765 --> 01:18:08.474
- So when does all this happen?

01:18:08.475 --> 01:18:10.268
I mean, are stars gonna fall from the sky

01:18:10.269 --> 01:18:12.312
the moment the peace treaty is signed?

01:18:12.313 --> 01:18:14.439
No. We still have a little time.

01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:16.733
The judgment won't
start until the midpoint

01:18:16.734 --> 01:18:18.693
of the seven years of tribulation.

01:18:18.694 --> 01:18:22.363
Then the antichrist will
declare himself as god.

01:18:22.364 --> 01:18:25.909
I know these political fellows
have pretty high opinions

01:18:25.910 --> 01:18:26.993
of themselves,

01:18:26.994 --> 01:18:30.997
but claiming to be god seemed
like a stretch even for them.

01:18:30.998 --> 01:18:35.293
You would think so, but the
entire world will buy into it.

01:18:35.294 --> 01:18:38.254
They will fall down and worship him.

01:18:38.255 --> 01:18:39.255
Really?

01:18:46.013 --> 01:18:48.848
Buck may have lost one of
his oldest friends that day,

01:18:48.849 --> 01:18:51.851
but he knew there was no time
to waste feeling bad about it.

01:18:51.852 --> 01:18:53.436
First of all, nobody gets in here.

01:18:53.437 --> 01:18:54.520
- [Bruce] The stakes were much higher

01:18:54.521 --> 01:18:55.897
than one man's death.

01:18:55.898 --> 01:18:58.024
And buck knew that he had
to get dirk's computer

01:18:58.025 --> 01:19:00.026
before the FBI found it and buried it

01:19:00.027 --> 01:19:02.070
in a warehouse somewhere.

01:19:02.071 --> 01:19:03.071
You know the one.

01:19:04.031 --> 01:19:05.740
When he arrived at the university,

01:19:05.741 --> 01:19:07.659
they were still cleaning out dirk's office

01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:10.328
and probably trying to crack that safe

01:19:10.329 --> 01:19:14.624
that almost managed to
give buck a smile, almost.

01:19:14.625 --> 01:19:17.919
Right now though all that
matters was getting that laptop

01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:21.048
and making sure dirk's death
was not going to be in vain.

01:19:42.319 --> 01:19:44.112
There he is. We got him

01:19:44.113 --> 01:19:46.782
[intense music]

01:19:56.792 --> 01:19:57.793
[Groaning] Stairs.

01:20:04.466 --> 01:20:07.136
[Siren blaring]

01:20:18.856 --> 01:20:21.357
The dumpster, just in case.

01:20:21.358 --> 01:20:25.695
[Gun firing] [Metal clanging]

01:20:25.696 --> 01:20:27.613
- Let's get outta here.

01:20:27.614 --> 01:20:29.658
[Siren blaring]
Let him get away.

01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:52.765
[Metal clanging] [Intense music]

01:21:06.195 --> 01:21:07.195
- [Sighs] Great.

01:21:10.824 --> 01:21:12.617
I love the platform.

01:21:12.618 --> 01:21:14.243
It's just too dangerous.

01:21:14.244 --> 01:21:15.120
But nicolae.

01:21:15.121 --> 01:21:17.747
I trust you both and
I'm completely convinced

01:21:17.748 --> 01:21:19.207
that the platform will provide the hope

01:21:19.208 --> 01:21:20.417
that you say it will.

01:21:21.919 --> 01:21:24.670
- You have me at a disadvantaged friend.

01:21:24.671 --> 01:21:25.714
Why the hesitation?

01:21:26.715 --> 01:21:29.927
- You're a good man,
Jonathan, I know this.

01:21:30.886 --> 01:21:33.971
And believe me, I'm a very
good judge of character.

01:21:33.972 --> 01:21:36.015
And if I wasn't completely
convinced that your motives

01:21:36.016 --> 01:21:39.936
were pure, I would've never
considered any of this.

01:21:39.937 --> 01:21:43.481
Well, I appreciate the trust, but?

01:21:43.482 --> 01:21:46.025
What if this ere to
fall in the wrong hands?

01:21:46.026 --> 01:21:47.443
- What do you mean?

01:21:47.444 --> 01:21:49.237
If something were to happen to you?

01:21:49.238 --> 01:21:50.864
Do you have a successor in place?

01:21:52.282 --> 01:21:53.283
Now, I understand.

01:21:55.244 --> 01:21:56.828
You'll be pleased to know
that I've already chosen

01:21:56.829 --> 01:22:00.039
a successor and no one
can persuade me otherwise,

01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:01.125
not even you.

01:22:02.376 --> 01:22:04.085
My choice is final.

01:22:04.086 --> 01:22:06.839
And might I ask, who would that be?

01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:10.509
Well, you, of course.

01:22:19.143 --> 01:22:22.979
[Announcer] You have
one new voice message.

01:22:22.980 --> 01:22:24.522
First message.

01:22:24.523 --> 01:22:27.900
[Caller] Mr. Williams,
there's something going on here.

01:22:27.901 --> 01:22:29.527
Erica Miller is dead.

01:22:29.528 --> 01:22:32.321
They say she od'ed or something
and drowned in her bathtub,

01:22:32.322 --> 01:22:33.824
but I know that's not true.

01:22:34.783 --> 01:22:36.784
This place is swarming with feds.

01:22:36.785 --> 01:22:39.162
They're clearing out her office.

01:22:39.163 --> 01:22:41.831
The feds don't investigate accidents.

01:22:41.832 --> 01:22:43.791
Ivy thinks Erica stole herfiles

01:22:43.792 --> 01:22:46.919
and was digging into stonagal
and dominator analytics.

01:22:46.920 --> 01:22:49.630
And now Mr. Plank, well, he
has the whole team drumming up

01:22:49.631 --> 01:22:53.259
a story that Dr. Burton
was a suicide bomber.

01:22:53.260 --> 01:22:55.386
Look, I'm guessing this
is gonna get me fired,

01:22:55.387 --> 01:22:57.180
but I feel like I have to say something.

01:22:57.181 --> 01:22:58.639
Everything that's happening
in the world right now

01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:00.099
was predicted in the Bible.

01:23:00.100 --> 01:23:01.977
That's where you'll find the answers.

01:23:07.274 --> 01:23:09.358
Hey, ray. — hey.

01:23:09.359 --> 01:23:10.652
Could we talk for a minute?

01:23:11.612 --> 01:23:13.113
- Oh yeah, of course.

01:23:17.117 --> 01:23:20.078
- So you and I were both
married to true believers.

01:23:21.038 --> 01:23:25.583
Can I ask you what stopped
you from hearing it?

01:23:25.584 --> 01:23:29.003
Oh, well,

01:23:29.004 --> 01:23:31.715
I made a lot of mistakes in my life,

01:23:32.758 --> 01:23:37.763
but blaming Irene's faith
for my own bad decisions

01:23:38.805 --> 01:23:42.183
is the biggest one, because she was right.

01:23:42.184 --> 01:23:44.769
But you couldn't have known that then.

01:23:44.770 --> 01:23:46.480
I would've if I had listened.

01:23:48.899 --> 01:23:51.359
- It's easier to see that now.

01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:54.279
Well, not for most people, it seems.

01:23:55.489 --> 01:23:59.952
- So, Irene did herjob.

01:24:00.994 --> 01:24:04.498
- Yeah, she did. She did.

01:24:07.125 --> 01:24:08.418
I knew it was the rapture,

01:24:10.712 --> 01:24:13.090
but I still didn't learn my lesson.

01:24:15.759 --> 01:24:17.134
And what lesson is that?

01:24:17.135 --> 01:24:19.429
Always trying to find
someone else to blame.

01:24:21.098 --> 01:24:23.267
Is never gonna lead you to find the truth.

01:24:24.643 --> 01:24:29.356
I spent months blaming
her for not trying harder,

01:24:30.190 --> 01:24:32.942
but I know if she had tried harder,

01:24:32.943 --> 01:24:34.278
I would've just walked out.

01:24:36.238 --> 01:24:39.741
But you're absolutely
right, Irene did do herjob,

01:24:41.243 --> 01:24:45.121
and now it's up to me to show her

01:24:45.122 --> 01:24:47.207
that her words weren't wasted on me.

01:24:50.919 --> 01:24:51.919
It's your turn.

01:24:53.505 --> 01:24:57.717
- Oh, same story, different excuses.

01:24:57.718 --> 01:25:01.555
I was just never able to get there.

01:25:02.431 --> 01:25:03.432
Get there?

01:25:07.686 --> 01:25:08.686
To the cross.

01:25:10.314 --> 01:25:13.483
I just could never let go of my doubt.

01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:16.695
So what was I supposed to do?

01:25:18.947 --> 01:25:23.660
Go up there and kneel
before god and lie to him

01:25:24.578 --> 01:25:28.497
and tell him that I believed
when I knew deep in my heart

01:25:28.498 --> 01:25:30.000
that I wasn't sure.

01:25:33.545 --> 01:25:37.215
Far be it for me to
lecture anybody about faith.

01:25:39.134 --> 01:25:40.886
But I do know this.

01:25:42.179 --> 01:25:44.847
Faith isn't about having no doubt,

01:25:44.848 --> 01:25:46.850
that's not faith, that's knowledge.

01:25:47.976 --> 01:25:52.563
Faith is about taking that walk

01:25:52.564 --> 01:25:54.775
to the cross in spite of it.

01:25:58.153 --> 01:26:03.158
- So, do you no longer have any doubt?

01:26:03.950 --> 01:26:08.914
Well, I still have some,

01:26:09.956 --> 01:26:12.249
but I think that's human nature.

01:26:12.250 --> 01:26:15.879
When I first got down on my knees

01:26:17.172 --> 01:26:18.422
and asked for forgiveness,

01:26:18.423 --> 01:26:22.760
I thought that I would
have to meet Jesus halfway.

01:26:22.761 --> 01:26:25.222
But I was scared

01:26:27.557 --> 01:26:29.601
that I couldn't even get there halfway.

01:26:31.061 --> 01:26:34.313
But see, I remember that we
had this picture of Jesus

01:26:34.314 --> 01:26:39.319
that we hung at home and
it was up there forever,

01:26:39.611 --> 01:26:44.616
and it said, "behold, I
stand at the door and knock."

01:26:46.451 --> 01:26:48.995
I never knew what it meant, but I do now.

01:26:50.414 --> 01:26:54.459
He's knocking at your door right now.

01:26:58.296 --> 01:27:00.173
You don't have to meet him halfway way.

01:27:01.633 --> 01:27:05.053
You just have to open the door.

01:27:20.736 --> 01:27:23.530
Chloe? [Chloe panting]

01:27:28.118 --> 01:27:29.410
When you told me to meet you here,

01:27:29.411 --> 01:27:32.289
you didn't mention we'd
be digging someone up.

01:27:35.625 --> 01:27:37.169
Are you sure you wanna do this?

01:27:39.963 --> 01:27:41.423
I don't want to. I need to.

01:27:42.632 --> 01:27:43.508
I understand.

01:27:43.509 --> 01:27:47.929
I just, digging up a grave
like this is just a little.

01:27:49.097 --> 01:27:50.097
What? Crazy?

01:27:51.558 --> 01:27:52.934
- I was gonna say extreme.

01:27:56.104 --> 01:27:58.481
Well, I can say the
same thing about stonagal.

01:27:58.482 --> 01:28:00.859
At least the grave I'm
digging isn't my own.

01:28:03.236 --> 01:28:05.196
Chloe, I know what you
hope to find in here,

01:28:05.197 --> 01:28:06.406
but what if it's just.

01:28:11.495 --> 01:28:12.746
Then at least I'll know.

01:28:19.377 --> 01:28:21.797
- Okay. Okay.

01:28:25.091 --> 01:28:26.091
Ready.

01:28:37.395 --> 01:28:41.315
- [Bruce] Chloe got what she
needed that night, proof.

01:28:41.316 --> 01:28:43.275
Not just proof of the rapture,

01:28:43.276 --> 01:28:47.446
but something much bigger,
proof that the Bible was right,

01:28:47.447 --> 01:28:51.158
that god was real, that Jesus was real.

01:28:51.159 --> 01:28:52.743
It was undeniable,

01:28:52.744 --> 01:28:54.995
and she truly believed
that she had been gifted

01:28:54.996 --> 01:28:56.205
with a miracle.

01:28:56.206 --> 01:28:58.124
That buck was there to see it with her.

01:28:59.209 --> 01:29:02.378
Even you have to admit,
this is getting pretty hard

01:29:02.379 --> 01:29:03.671
to deny.

01:29:03.672 --> 01:29:06.841
Those who are gone. They knew the truth.

01:29:06.842 --> 01:29:11.847
Brothers, sisters, we can no
longer hide from the truth,

01:29:13.348 --> 01:29:17.810
and we must commit here and
now to accept in the truth,

01:29:17.811 --> 01:29:21.605
and accept in our role in
sharing it with as many people

01:29:21.606 --> 01:29:22.606
as we can.

01:29:23.900 --> 01:29:26.695
We have lied to ourselves for too long.

01:29:27.946 --> 01:29:28.946
Join me.

01:29:30.115 --> 01:29:32.409
Join us.

01:29:33.368 --> 01:29:38.373
J' lord I trouble and sorrow without you j'

01:29:39.666 --> 01:29:44.671
I then there always some never find I

01:29:44.796 --> 01:29:46.298
- hey, aren't you ready?

01:29:47.924 --> 01:29:50.051
- Oh, I can't get saved as a favor to you.

01:29:52.637 --> 01:29:53.805
This is the only way.

01:29:55.640 --> 01:29:57.975
- You should go. I have
to make a quick call.

01:29:57.976 --> 01:29:58.976
I'll be back.

01:30:06.067 --> 01:30:07.067
- Let us pray.

01:30:08.653 --> 01:30:11.156
Lord, we thank you.

01:30:12.282 --> 01:30:15.784
We know that we are
rebuilding our church, lord,

01:30:15.785 --> 01:30:19.039
and we ask for your
guidance as we go fonnard.

01:30:21.166 --> 01:30:23.084
We accept you into our hearts, lord,

01:30:25.211 --> 01:30:28.297
and we are graciously
thankful for your presence

01:30:28.298 --> 01:30:30.007
with us today.

01:30:30.008 --> 01:30:32.135
Thank you, lord Jesus.

01:30:35.138 --> 01:30:36.972
Hi, it's Cameron Williams.

01:30:36.973 --> 01:30:38.432
Buck, how are you my friend?

01:30:38.433 --> 01:30:39.267
Yeah, look, I'm fine.

01:30:39.268 --> 01:30:41.310
I don't have a lot of time.

01:30:41.311 --> 01:30:43.604
Are you alone? — yes.

01:30:43.605 --> 01:30:45.606
I'm calling to warn you.

01:30:45.607 --> 01:30:48.275
I have clear evidence
that Jonathan stonagal,

01:30:48.276 --> 01:30:49.985
is not who he appears to be.

01:30:49.986 --> 01:30:51.737
I've been doing some digging on the guy.

01:30:51.738 --> 01:30:54.323
He's been killing people for
asking too many questions.

01:30:54.324 --> 01:30:55.200
What?

01:30:55.201 --> 01:30:57.993
He's taking your entire Eden
pay project and piggybacked

01:30:57.994 --> 01:30:59.828
all kinds of extras into it.

01:30:59.829 --> 01:31:01.664
Spyware, for lack of better terms.

01:31:01.665 --> 01:31:02.624
But how?

01:31:02.625 --> 01:31:05.042
Trust me, he's done it.

01:31:05.043 --> 01:31:08.879
And as far as the recent
vanishings? All faked by stonagal,

01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:11.507
I have proof that he's
been using you and nicolae

01:31:11.508 --> 01:31:12.509
for his own ends.

01:31:13.426 --> 01:31:15.427
I don't know what to say.

01:31:15.428 --> 01:31:17.471
Look I'm gonna come to you
now, I'll bring the evidence,

01:31:17.472 --> 01:31:21.810
but I need you to tell nicolae
and I need you to do it now.

01:31:35.865 --> 01:31:39.868
Nicolae, I just had
a very disturbing call

01:31:39.869 --> 01:31:41.870
from Cameron Williams.

01:31:41.871 --> 01:31:45.040
He says he has proof that
stonagal is setting us up

01:31:45.041 --> 01:31:48.085
and that he has killed
people in the process.

01:31:48.086 --> 01:31:50.504
- Do you trust him?
- Cameron Williams?

01:31:50.505 --> 01:31:51.547
I've known him for years.

01:31:51.548 --> 01:31:53.717
He's always been completely honest.

01:31:56.636 --> 01:31:58.179
Then we have to bring him in.

01:31:59.431 --> 01:32:01.516
I need to confront both of them in person.

01:32:02.851 --> 01:32:05.812
I'll call an emergency meeting
a security council tomorrow.

01:32:06.646 --> 01:32:07.896
- Good.

01:32:07.897 --> 01:32:10.900
[Suspenseful music]

01:32:19.909 --> 01:32:22.412
I'm sorry I was so stubborn.

01:32:23.663 --> 01:32:26.498
Guess now we both know
how mom must have felt.

01:32:26.499 --> 01:32:27.499
Yeah.

01:32:28.710 --> 01:32:31.253
- Just got off the phone
with Chaim rosensweig.

01:32:31.254 --> 01:32:34.381
We're gonna confront stonagal
with everything dirk found.

01:32:34.382 --> 01:32:36.300
Hopefully stop him from turning the world

01:32:36.301 --> 01:32:37.384
into a dystopian nightmare.

01:32:37.385 --> 01:32:38.261
I'll see you soon.

01:32:38.261 --> 01:32:39.261
Wait, buck, wait.

01:32:40.096 --> 01:32:43.433
- You, uh, really should
take a look at this first.

01:32:44.559 --> 01:32:45.809
I've seen all this stuff before.

01:32:45.810 --> 01:32:49.396
It's just heads and horns and
beasts could mean anything.

01:32:49.397 --> 01:32:50.439
No offense to the rest of you,

01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:53.108
I just don't happen to believe
our future is pre-ordained.

01:32:53.109 --> 01:32:55.027
So please, let me just finish.

01:32:55.028 --> 01:32:56.487
- Just let you ignore it

01:32:56.488 --> 01:32:58.406
because it doesn't fit your narrative.

01:32:59.949 --> 01:33:01.493
Oh, Chloe

01:33:03.536 --> 01:33:05.329
tooth is two.

01:33:05.330 --> 01:33:07.540
That was the password dirk
used to get into Eden.

01:33:15.590 --> 01:33:17.884
Okay, I'm listening.

01:33:20.428 --> 01:33:21.637
Okay, so according to this,

01:33:21.638 --> 01:33:24.056
we should be expecting a Jewish temple,

01:33:24.057 --> 01:33:26.141
which would replace the dome of the rock,

01:33:26.142 --> 01:33:27.768
which would pretty much seem impossible

01:33:27.769 --> 01:33:30.145
if it wasn't for this,

01:33:30.146 --> 01:33:33.190
a peace treaty that gives
Israel the UN's protection

01:33:33.191 --> 01:33:35.734
and such a treaty would
also seem highly unlikely

01:33:35.735 --> 01:33:38.113
if it wasn't for this guy.

01:33:39.114 --> 01:33:40.114
- Right.

01:33:41.241 --> 01:33:42.866
- So you actually think Jonathan stonagal

01:33:42.867 --> 01:33:44.326
is the antichrist?

01:33:44.327 --> 01:33:47.496
Well, if I had to guess
right now, I'd say yes.

01:33:47.497 --> 01:33:49.498
Well, what if that's
what he wants you to guess.

01:33:49.499 --> 01:33:51.125
But why?

01:33:51.126 --> 01:33:52.835
Well, what if he's trying
to get the entire world

01:33:52.836 --> 01:33:54.336
to think he's here to save it?

01:33:54.337 --> 01:33:56.338
I mean, you're the one who
said everyone's gonna worship

01:33:56.339 --> 01:33:57.257
this guy.

01:33:57.258 --> 01:33:59.049
Well, what about nicolae carpathia?

01:33:59.050 --> 01:34:01.260
I mean, he certainly gets
good crowds behind him.

01:34:01.261 --> 01:34:03.428
No, no, nicolae could care
less about having people

01:34:03.429 --> 01:34:04.264
love him.

01:34:04.265 --> 01:34:05.389
So why would he pretend to be the-

01:34:05.390 --> 01:34:07.850
buck we're we're not talking
about anyone pretending

01:34:07.851 --> 01:34:09.184
to be the anti—christ.

01:34:09.185 --> 01:34:12.397
We're talking about someone
being the anti—christ.

01:34:13.314 --> 01:34:14.773
Now, I can't make you believe anything.

01:34:14.774 --> 01:34:16.024
No one can.

01:34:16.025 --> 01:34:17.985
But don't turn this into a conspiracy

01:34:17.986 --> 01:34:20.445
just because you wanna avoid the truth.

01:34:20.446 --> 01:34:23.532
I have seen what's inside
the Eden pay project,

01:34:23.533 --> 01:34:26.118
and believe me, it's not a pretty picture.

01:34:26.119 --> 01:34:28.537
If this guy gets in control
of the entire world's money

01:34:28.538 --> 01:34:30.664
supply, I mean, think
about what that would mean.

01:34:30.665 --> 01:34:33.293
- Oh, I could tell you exactly
what that's gonna mean.

01:34:36.629 --> 01:34:40.257
He causes all, both small
and great, rich and poor,

01:34:40.258 --> 01:34:43.844
free and slave to receive
a Mark on their right hand

01:34:43.845 --> 01:34:47.890
or in their forehead and
that no one may buy or sell

01:34:47.891 --> 01:34:49.934
except one who has the Mark.

01:34:55.815 --> 01:34:57.983
- Chaim just talked to nicolae.

01:34:57.984 --> 01:34:59.860
We're gonna meet first
thing in the morning.

01:34:59.861 --> 01:35:02.864
I have a lot of work to do. Gotta go, bye.

01:35:05.325 --> 01:35:06.325
Pray for me.

01:35:07.619 --> 01:35:10.205
The boy's gonna need a
whole lot more than prayer.

01:35:14.584 --> 01:35:18.670
- Buck are you even listening
to a word they said?

01:35:18.671 --> 01:35:19.631
You can't go there.

01:35:19.632 --> 01:35:21.089
I heard the same thing you did.

01:35:21.090 --> 01:35:22.650
Well, it doesn't look that way to me.

01:35:23.801 --> 01:35:26.178
- Chloe, you found what
you were looking for

01:35:26.179 --> 01:35:27.846
and I'm so happy that you did.

01:35:27.847 --> 01:35:30.724
But that was your answer, not mine.

01:35:30.725 --> 01:35:31.767
I'm still looking.

01:35:31.768 --> 01:35:35.146
That wasn't my answer.
That was the answer.

01:35:36.898 --> 01:35:37.774
I understand.

01:35:37.775 --> 01:35:39.275
No, I don't think you do.

01:35:40.485 --> 01:35:41.902
I know.

01:35:41.903 --> 01:35:44.863
I have to go. I'll be
very careful, I promise.

01:35:44.864 --> 01:35:45.864
- Hey, just.

01:35:49.577 --> 01:35:50.577
At least take this.

01:36:00.421 --> 01:36:02.589
I love you, Chloe Steele.

01:36:02.590 --> 01:36:04.008
I love you too.

01:36:06.261 --> 01:36:08.846
[Upbeat music]

01:36:12.392 --> 01:36:15.395
[People chattering]

01:36:23.027 --> 01:36:26.071
- Sorry to drop all this on
you at the last minute. I just.

01:36:26.072 --> 01:36:28.824
- These are high stakes,
buck. I understand that.

01:36:28.825 --> 01:36:31.076
And so does nicolae.

01:36:31.077 --> 01:36:33.245
We have to do it properly and we will.

01:36:33.246 --> 01:36:35.206
God is with Israel, remember?

01:36:36.124 --> 01:36:38.292
- Yeah, I just hope the
peace accord with Israel

01:36:38.293 --> 01:36:40.127
can still happen without stonagal.

01:36:40.128 --> 01:36:44.131
If god wants it to happen
now, it will happen now.

01:36:44.132 --> 01:36:47.968
But this is not just
about the peace treaty.

01:36:47.969 --> 01:36:52.514
I have long dreamed of finally
having the temple rebuilt on

01:36:52.515 --> 01:36:53.890
the temple mount.

01:36:53.891 --> 01:36:55.809
And when stonagal agreed to finance it,

01:36:55.810 --> 01:36:58.438
it was the happiest day of my life.

01:37:00.106 --> 01:37:02.316
Well, what about the dome of the rock?

01:37:02.317 --> 01:37:04.151
Are the arabs really just
gonna let you tear it down?

01:37:04.152 --> 01:37:06.153
- No. Of course not.

01:37:06.154 --> 01:37:08.322
Stonagal's team located the foundations of

01:37:08.323 --> 01:37:10.449
the original temple.

01:37:10.450 --> 01:37:14.494
It's beside the dome not under it.

01:37:14.495 --> 01:37:15.662
- So you can have both.

01:37:15.663 --> 01:37:18.081
- Yes, and peace in the middle east,

01:37:18.082 --> 01:37:21.960
arabs and Jews worshiping
side by side in Harmony.

01:37:21.961 --> 01:37:23.920
And even though the initial peace treaty

01:37:23.921 --> 01:37:26.632
will only be seven years, I think...

01:37:27.675 --> 01:37:29.384
What's wrong, buck?

01:37:29.385 --> 01:37:31.136
- Did you just say seven years?

01:37:31.137 --> 01:37:32.137
Yes.

01:37:36.225 --> 01:37:37.435
I just need a minute.

01:37:56.788 --> 01:37:57.955
It's all real.

01:37:58.998 --> 01:38:00.166
It's all real.

01:38:14.222 --> 01:38:16.057
I didn't want to believe in you, god,

01:38:18.101 --> 01:38:20.978
but I was wrong and I'm so sorry.

01:38:28.361 --> 01:38:29.445
Forgive me Jesus.

01:38:34.867 --> 01:38:36.244
I just know that I need you

01:38:38.913 --> 01:38:39.914
and I do believe.

01:38:48.131 --> 01:38:50.716
[Buck sobbing]

01:38:57.014 --> 01:38:58.141
Show me what to do.

01:39:00.518 --> 01:39:03.103
- [Bruce] Jesus promised that
where two or three gather

01:39:03.104 --> 01:39:05.897
in my name, there I am with them.

01:39:05.898 --> 01:39:09.484
We gathered and we prayed
and I felt his presence

01:39:09.485 --> 01:39:11.028
for the very first time.

01:39:13.531 --> 01:39:15.991
[Buck] Hey, Connor, it's me, buck,

01:39:15.992 --> 01:39:18.910
I got your message and I
just wanted to let you know

01:39:18.911 --> 01:39:19.911
you were right.

01:39:20.913 --> 01:39:22.956
I found the truth in the
only place it can be found.

01:39:22.957 --> 01:39:24.541
Oh, thank you Jesus.

01:39:24.542 --> 01:39:26.461
I'm gonna need your help with something.

01:39:35.136 --> 01:39:37.137
Connor. Good, you got my message.

01:39:37.138 --> 01:39:38.889
[Bruce] Buck still had his focus clearly

01:39:38.890 --> 01:39:42.601
on his journalistic duty
to expose stonagal's lies.

01:39:42.602 --> 01:39:45.312
But he also knew there
was a very real chance

01:39:45.313 --> 01:39:48.440
that no matter what evidence
he brought to the table,

01:39:48.441 --> 01:39:50.567
old Steve plank would
never let that news see

01:39:50.568 --> 01:39:52.153
the light of day.

01:39:53.112 --> 01:39:56.615
Connor was buck's insurance
policy against being censored

01:39:56.616 --> 01:39:59.117
and he hoped theirfaith
would be enough to keep them

01:39:59.118 --> 01:40:01.328
from being deceived by stonagal,

01:40:01.329 --> 01:40:03.915
even if he was working
for the devil himself.

01:40:05.458 --> 01:40:08.168
Hi, I'm. — Mr. Cameron Williams.

01:40:08.169 --> 01:40:09.836
Good morning.

01:40:09.837 --> 01:40:11.796
Please see a member of
security team on your way in.

01:40:11.797 --> 01:40:12.757
They'll show you the way.

01:40:12.757 --> 01:40:13.757
Thank you.

01:40:15.968 --> 01:40:19.095
Ephesians chapter six tells
us to put on the full armor

01:40:19.096 --> 01:40:21.223
of god so that you can take your stand

01:40:21.224 --> 01:40:23.308
against the devil's schemes.

01:40:23.309 --> 01:40:25.101
Well, buck may not have known it,

01:40:25.102 --> 01:40:27.103
but when he walked into the room that day,

01:40:27.104 --> 01:40:28.813
he was ready,

01:40:28.814 --> 01:40:31.650
ready like he had never been before.

01:40:31.651 --> 01:40:34.027
He hit them with
everything he and dirk had

01:40:34.028 --> 01:40:36.947
uncovered, exposing beyond
the shadow of a doubt,

01:40:36.948 --> 01:40:40.450
stonagal's evil plan to deceive the world.

01:40:40.451 --> 01:40:44.621
As soon as he was finished, he
felt a huge flood of relief.

01:40:44.622 --> 01:40:46.456
He had managed to get
the truth to the people

01:40:46.457 --> 01:40:49.834
who needed to hear it, or so it seemed.

01:40:49.835 --> 01:40:52.212
- So, as you can clearly see

01:40:52.213 --> 01:40:55.924
this diabolical plan, not only
take over the money supply,

01:40:55.925 --> 01:40:58.636
but to enslave the world
into technocratic nightmare

01:41:00.638 --> 01:41:02.473
was all set up at the highest levels.

01:41:03.641 --> 01:41:04.641
Thank you.

01:41:09.438 --> 01:41:14.067
Thankfully, Mr. Williams
investigation has put the pieces

01:41:14.068 --> 01:41:18.697
together showing all of us
that Jonathan has plotted,

01:41:18.698 --> 01:41:20.615
lied, and murdered,

01:41:20.616 --> 01:41:24.244
not only to gain control of Eden currency,

01:41:24.245 --> 01:41:27.415
but the entire global financial network.

01:41:29.834 --> 01:41:30.917
That's ridiculous.

01:41:30.918 --> 01:41:31.961
What's going on here?

01:41:34.130 --> 01:41:35.298
That is the question.

01:41:36.465 --> 01:41:39.218
The question each of us has been asking

01:41:41.596 --> 01:41:44.140
what is really going on?

01:41:45.766 --> 01:41:48.101
Mr. Williams, for example,

01:41:48.102 --> 01:41:52.480
he has employed his skills
to draw certain conclusions

01:41:52.481 --> 01:41:53.481
about you.

01:41:54.358 --> 01:41:57.862
But in fact, if he thinks
about it hard enough,

01:41:59.322 --> 01:42:03.158
he'll have to ask himself
who was on the inside

01:42:03.159 --> 01:42:05.870
that gave him access to what exactly.

01:42:09.790 --> 01:42:14.294
A highly convenient file,
full of evidence implicating

01:42:14.295 --> 01:42:18.174
Jonathan of all he's been
accused of here today.

01:42:20.259 --> 01:42:22.595
I half expected you to
see right through that.

01:42:24.263 --> 01:42:28.850
And Chaim, your fervent dream
to bring peace to Israel

01:42:28.851 --> 01:42:30.019
has been granted,

01:42:31.103 --> 01:42:33.022
if only you understood the cost.

01:42:36.817 --> 01:42:41.071
And Jonathan, this goes
much deeper for you,

01:42:41.072 --> 01:42:42.614
doesn't it?

01:42:42.615 --> 01:42:45.950
Beyond your endless
thirst for more control

01:42:45.951 --> 01:42:50.205
and material gain, you really
see yourself as a great man

01:42:50.206 --> 01:42:53.125
rebuilding the world in your own image

01:42:54.168 --> 01:42:56.420
certainly needed no help
from me to see that.

01:42:58.506 --> 01:43:00.341
You have paved the way.

01:43:01.592 --> 01:43:05.596
That is your contribution to history.

01:43:07.556 --> 01:43:09.724
This is preposterous.

01:43:09.725 --> 01:43:10.685
You can't just come in here,

01:43:10.686 --> 01:43:13.687
make these baseless allegations
and think you can take

01:43:13.688 --> 01:43:16.064
what I built, what is mine?

01:43:16.065 --> 01:43:18.275
How do you think you're
gonna do that, nicolae?

01:43:19.235 --> 01:43:21.403
Let me tell you what is about to happen.

01:43:21.404 --> 01:43:24.614
An assassin masquerading
as a security guard

01:43:24.615 --> 01:43:29.620
will draw his gun intent on
killing Mr. Stonagal and myself.

01:43:30.913 --> 01:43:34.624
In a hail of gunfire,
Mr. Cothran and stonagal

01:43:34.625 --> 01:43:36.252
will be fatally wounded.

01:43:37.128 --> 01:43:40.088
Oh, barely escape with my life.

01:43:40.089 --> 01:43:42.842
Thanks to security guards
who quickly return fire.

01:43:46.345 --> 01:43:47.345
- You're insane?

01:43:48.764 --> 01:43:51.142
What makes you think you
can get away with this?

01:43:52.101 --> 01:43:56.312
By simply killing you.

01:43:56.313 --> 01:43:58.440
[Gun firing]

01:43:58.441 --> 01:44:02.820
You see, Jonathan, there will be peace,

01:44:04.029 --> 01:44:05.029
but not with you.

01:44:07.825 --> 01:44:09.909
Nicolae? [Gun firing]

01:44:09.910 --> 01:44:10.911
Your time is over

01:44:12.246 --> 01:44:14.707
and mine has just begun.

01:44:20.588 --> 01:44:24.216
[Gun firing] [Intense music]

01:44:37.062 --> 01:44:42.067
And now, now I am devastated by the loss,

01:44:43.527 --> 01:44:48.239
yet forced to take up

01:44:48.240 --> 01:44:51.201
the mantle of his leadership.

01:44:51.202 --> 01:44:54.455

01:45:12.056 --> 01:45:14.098

[People chattering]

01:45:16.894 --> 01:45:17.770
- Are you okay?

01:45:17.771 --> 01:45:20.564
It was awful when that
security guard started firing.

01:45:23.442 --> 01:45:24.318
- Did you see what happened?

01:45:24.319 --> 01:45:26.570
- Yes, poor nicolae. Who
would wanna kill him?

01:45:27.613 --> 01:45:30.573
[Man] Hurry.
— [woman] Did you see that.

01:45:30.574 --> 01:45:31.825
[Man 2] Who started firing?

01:45:31.826 --> 01:45:33.744
[Woman 2] Is so crazy.

01:45:41.669 --> 01:45:45.797
Mr Williams. This is crazy!
Did you see it? [Panting]

01:45:45.798 --> 01:45:48.384
I think I know what really
happened. Come with me.

01:45:52.638 --> 01:45:53.681
- Buck, are you okay?

01:45:55.933 --> 01:45:57.309
Hey, what's going on?

01:46:02.815 --> 01:46:04.233
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

01:46:05.568 --> 01:46:08.320
[Dramatic music]

01:46:33.178 --> 01:46:36.432
[Engine roaring] — yes.

01:46:56.785 --> 01:47:00.663
- Ladies and gentlemen, my
name is nicolae carpathia

01:47:00.664 --> 01:47:02.624
and I come to you tonight
with a heavy heart.

01:47:02.625 --> 01:47:05.085
- Good afternoon. My
name's Cameron Williams.

01:47:06.295 --> 01:47:07.838
I'm here to tell you a story,

01:47:08.797 --> 01:47:11.926
story about lies from the media,

01:47:12.801 --> 01:47:16.972
harder story about the
only truth that matters.

01:47:20.267 --> 01:47:22.977
Nicolae carpathia is the
new secretary general

01:47:22.978 --> 01:47:26.147
of the UN and right now
he is making a speech.

01:47:26.148 --> 01:47:30.693
Well, I'm here to tell you it's all lies.

01:47:30.694 --> 01:47:33.696
Looks like Cameron Williams
finally found the truth.

01:47:33.697 --> 01:47:34.697
Yes.

01:47:35.366 --> 01:47:36.909
- He's gotta be on this floor.

01:47:39.495 --> 01:47:42.705
He told you that the vanishings
came with no warnings,

01:47:42.706 --> 01:47:45.166
with no explanation.

01:47:45.167 --> 01:47:48.878
Then there was a second
wave of vanishings.

01:47:48.879 --> 01:47:52.423
And worst of all, he
told you that the rapture

01:47:52.424 --> 01:47:54.425
had been debunked.

01:47:54.426 --> 01:47:56.427
Take a picture of your
screen right now and...

01:47:56.428 --> 01:47:57.428
Turn it off.

01:47:57.429 --> 01:47:59.305
And no matter what you may hear,

01:47:59.306 --> 01:48:02.809
it's not too late to let
Jesus Christ set you free.

01:48:02.810 --> 01:48:03.935
I'm proof of that.

01:48:03.936 --> 01:48:06.312
When buck's broadcast
went out to the world,

01:48:06.313 --> 01:48:08.439
it felt like a huge victory.

01:48:08.440 --> 01:48:10.733
But the Bible warned us
it wouldn't be as easy

01:48:10.734 --> 01:48:13.319
as just telling everyone the truth.

01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:14.862
But I've always taught,

01:48:14.863 --> 01:48:18.282
and now I believe that even
if a single soul is saved,

01:48:18.283 --> 01:48:20.827
then your efforts have not been in vain.

01:48:20.828 --> 01:48:23.121
Right now, though, the
impact of buck's message

01:48:23.122 --> 01:48:24.956
would have to be analyzed later.

01:48:24.957 --> 01:48:26.958
He knew some people were bound to disagree

01:48:26.959 --> 01:48:28.168
with what he had to say.

01:48:55.112 --> 01:49:00.117
[Upbeat music]
[Tires screeching]

01:49:38.238 --> 01:49:39.655
- Are you guys okay?

01:49:39.656 --> 01:49:42.409
[Engine roaring]

01:49:44.369 --> 01:49:49.374
[Tires screeching]
[Intense music]

01:50:07.267 --> 01:50:08.309
Made it just in time.

01:50:08.310 --> 01:50:10.312
Now you gotta stop doing this to me.

01:50:12.731 --> 01:50:14.065
Everyone okay?

01:50:14.066 --> 01:50:15.775
Yeah. — all good.

01:50:15.776 --> 01:50:18.194
[Bruce] They were all so
anxious and even excited

01:50:18.195 --> 01:50:20.571
to start sharing the word with the world.

01:50:20.572 --> 01:50:22.406
It was wonderful to see,

01:50:22.407 --> 01:50:25.827
but they'd only been studying
prophecy for a few days.

01:50:25.828 --> 01:50:28.704
The reality of the final seven
years before the return of

01:50:28.705 --> 01:50:31.208
Christ hadn't started sinking in just yet.

01:50:32.376 --> 01:50:35.628
Jesus told us these last years
would be worse than anything

01:50:35.629 --> 01:50:37.588
the world had ever seen.

01:50:37.589 --> 01:50:39.465
- Here's a good spot, right?

01:50:39.466 --> 01:50:42.301
- [Bruce] God gave us an
exemption if we wanted it.

01:50:42.302 --> 01:50:45.429
But for those of us who
chose not to take it,

01:50:45.430 --> 01:50:48.850
those of us who were left behind, well,

01:50:48.851 --> 01:50:51.018
we'll just have to see what happens.

01:50:51.019 --> 01:50:52.020
[Actor] Hey, look.

01:50:53.897 --> 01:50:55.606
[Bruce] I know there's nothing we can do

01:50:55.607 --> 01:50:58.234
to stop what's been
prophesied from happening,

01:50:58.235 --> 01:51:00.903
but that doesn't mean we just give up.

01:51:00.904 --> 01:51:02.489
Not even close.

01:51:03.365 --> 01:51:05.533
There are souls to be saved.

01:51:05.534 --> 01:51:09.913
And as long as there are,
our mission is clear.

01:51:10.998 --> 01:51:16.003
J' facing defeat I am holding
onto your promise now I

01:51:20.591 --> 01:51:23.259
j' raise me up on eagle's wings j'

01:51:23.260 --> 01:51:25.761

I breathe your life into me I

01:51:30.809 --> 01:51:33.644
j' a battle cry is in my lungs j'

01:51:33.645 --> 01:51:36.230
j' singing out your kingdom come j'

01:51:36.231 --> 01:51:40.234

j' I stand here, at yourfeet j'

01:51:45.073 --> 01:51:50.078

I my weary bones j'

01:52:16.396 --> 01:52:21.401
I they come alive with, the sound of you j'

01:52:23.946 --> 01:52:26.489
j' restoring hope j'

01:52:26.490 --> 01:52:31.495
j' in my anxious spirit, forever new I

01:52:33.705 --> 01:52:36.332
j' raise me up on eagle's wings j'

01:52:36.333 --> 01:52:38.793
j' give my soul your bigger dreams j'

01:52:38.794 --> 01:52:43.799
I breathe your life into me I

01:52:43.840 --> 01:52:46.592
j' a battle cry is in my lungs j'

01:52:46.593 --> 01:52:49.345
j' singing out your kingdom come j'

01:52:49.346 --> 01:52:53.224
I fall in us, pour out your love j'

01:52:53.225 --> 01:52:58.145
j' I stand here, at yourfeet j'

01:52:58.146 --> 01:53:03.151
