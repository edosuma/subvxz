00:04.284 --> 00:06.411
Seems to me you're short
a driver for a while.

00:06.486 --> 00:08.420
Think you can
replace my Dad?

00:08.488 --> 00:10.718
I got a real smart car.

00:15.329 --> 00:17.991
How much longer are you going to insist
on reveling in chaos and destruction?

00:18.065 --> 00:20.533
It's a tough world out there,
Devon.

00:20.600 --> 00:23.899
I don't know who he is or what he wants.
You see he has a nice, fatal accident.

00:23.970 --> 00:27.872
Michael, we're not at speed
for this maneuver. Michael.

00:29.000 --> 00:35.074

00:43.023 --> 00:48.188
Knight Rider, a shadowy flight
into the dangerous world of a man...

00:48.261 --> 00:50.252
who does not exist.

01:00.273 --> 01:02.264
Michael Knight, a young loner...

01:02.342 --> 01:04.867
on a crusade to champion
the cause of the innocent,

01:04.944 --> 01:07.971
the helpless,
the powerless,

01:08.048 --> 01:11.609
in a world of criminals
who operate above the law.

02:21.021 --> 02:23.956
Michael, do you know why
Mr. Miles has sent for us?

02:24.024 --> 02:27.721
No, I don't know, but since we don't
have an extensive social relationship,

02:27.794 --> 02:29.785
it's probably
to brief me on another mission.

02:29.863 --> 02:30.989
Brief you?

02:31.064 --> 02:34.556
Oh, sorry. I meant us.
Thank you.

02:34.634 --> 02:37.569
You know, for a collection of
microprocessors, you're awfully touchy.

02:37.637 --> 02:41.971
Wrong. It's just that my circuits function
better when we operate in a reality mode.

02:42.042 --> 02:44.636
- KITT.
- Yes, Michael?

02:44.711 --> 02:46.679
Just keep driving.

02:53.320 --> 02:56.983
Good. This sucker will make my quota.

03:22.816 --> 03:25.216
You sure you're doing only 55?

03:25.285 --> 03:27.719
Of course I am.
Look at the readout yourself.

03:29.122 --> 03:31.386
Yeah, well, then
why is that cop chasing us?

03:31.458 --> 03:34.757
I wouldn't know.
After all, I'm a computer, not a psychic.

03:34.828 --> 03:37.763
However, I would strongly suspect
the officer behind us...

03:37.831 --> 03:41.733
may be trying to meet his daily ticket
quota in a somewhat irregular manner.

03:41.801 --> 03:47.296
Well, one thing's for sure. Bum rap or not,
I'm not taking any citation for your driving.

03:47.374 --> 03:51.868
I see. Well, listening to you explain that to
the police officer should be quite fascinating.

03:51.945 --> 03:54.641
It's only five miles to the county line.
Let's hit the turbo.

03:54.714 --> 03:56.614
Very good thinking, Michael.

04:17.870 --> 04:20.863
Whence croquet sprang
to benefit the Earth,

04:20.940 --> 04:24.069
what happy garden
gave this pastime birth?

04:26.413 --> 04:31.715
Devon, don't let anyone
tell you differently:

04:31.785 --> 04:34.049
You are a little strange.

04:34.120 --> 04:36.588
This is a game of gentlemen,
of serenity,

04:36.656 --> 04:39.716
of Charles II and Samuel Pepys.

04:39.793 --> 04:41.556
Know them?

04:41.628 --> 04:43.892
Only by reputation,
and from what I understand,

04:43.964 --> 04:45.898
they spent most of
their spare time in bed.

04:45.966 --> 04:49.424
Oh, trust you to take the poetry
out of poetry.

04:49.502 --> 04:51.766
Now, to business.
Yes.

04:51.838 --> 04:55.103
Twelve years ago, a fellow named
Sammy Phillips bought a racetrack.

04:55.175 --> 04:58.804
Yeah. It's called "Slammin' Sammy's
Super Stunt Show Spectacular."

05:00.013 --> 05:03.312
- Uh, don't ask me to say that again.
- I wouldn't dream of it.

05:03.383 --> 05:06.352
Devon, I've seen the guy perform.
He is incredible.

05:06.419 --> 05:10.355
Unfortunately, Sammy's show
may be closing shortly.

05:10.423 --> 05:13.654
Why? For some months now,
the Foundation's computers...

05:13.727 --> 05:17.527
have been tracing the movements
of a fellow named Lawrence Blake.

05:17.597 --> 05:22.534
One of Blake's favorite tricks is to pick
up second mortgages on marginal businesses.

05:22.602 --> 05:25.196
What's wrong with that?
Nothing on the face of it.

05:25.271 --> 05:29.037
The interesting thing is that once
the mortgage has been acquired,

05:29.109 --> 05:32.977
the business in question suffers
an unexpected misfortune and folds.

05:33.046 --> 05:37.540
- And Blake picks up the property for a song.
- Exactly.

05:37.617 --> 05:41.576
And something tells me Blake just
picked up Sammy's second mortgage, right?

05:41.655 --> 05:43.816
Oh. Very perceptive today, Michael.

05:43.890 --> 05:46.723
And you figure
that maybe I can stop him...

05:46.793 --> 05:50.854
before he does something nasty
to Sammy or his stunt show.

05:50.930 --> 05:54.559
Exactly. Or better still,
catch him in the act.

05:54.634 --> 05:56.898
Blake is long overdue
to be put away for a bit.

05:56.970 --> 06:00.565
- It'll be a pleasure.
- Oh, any thoughts?

06:00.640 --> 06:02.505
No, but I'll think of something.

06:02.575 --> 06:04.668
Michael, don't forget to clear it first.

06:04.744 --> 06:08.180
Now, don't go getting
any anxiety attacks here, Devon.

06:08.248 --> 06:11.342
- Trust me, will ya?
- Do I have a choice?

06:11.418 --> 06:14.012
Do I ever have a choice?

06:16.589 --> 06:19.581
Hello. Oh, yes.
I certainly will.

06:20.760 --> 06:25.697
Bonnie's ready for you. Ohhh. I only
wish that meant what it sounded like.

06:31.938 --> 06:34.600
Always was a kid's game to me.

07:00.467 --> 07:02.799
Hey, Dad. Listen. I just
worked out a really great stunt.

07:02.869 --> 07:04.996
I'm on my motorcycle, see,
and I do a headstand...

07:05.071 --> 07:08.666
Mark, I have enough problems here without
you splattering yourself all over the track.

07:08.742 --> 07:12.473
But I've been practicing, Dad. I... I can
do things on my bike as good as anybody.

07:12.545 --> 07:14.479
I said, "No."

07:15.715 --> 07:17.649
You're never gonna
give me a chance, are you?

07:17.717 --> 07:21.983
I didn't say that. When you're
ready. But I am ready, Dad.

07:22.055 --> 07:24.853
I got my routine down pat.

07:24.924 --> 07:27.825
Mark, your technique is fine.
You're just too eager, that's all.

07:27.894 --> 07:30.692
And in this line of work,
enthusiasm can get you killed.

07:30.764 --> 07:32.698
A little more maturity
is all you need.

07:32.766 --> 07:35.291
Now, just be patient, okay?

07:35.368 --> 07:37.859
Now, go on.
Gas up my car before the show.

07:37.937 --> 07:40.929
Oh, big deal!
Hi, Mark.

07:42.442 --> 07:45.605
Let me guess. He wants to
perform on his motorcycle.

07:45.678 --> 07:48.841
Kids.
He is getting real good, Dad.

07:48.915 --> 07:52.112
Look. Like I told him,
not now, okay?

07:52.185 --> 07:55.643
- Well, what's with you?
- Oh, nothing. Nothing at all.

07:55.722 --> 07:57.883
We're just barely breaking even here.

07:57.957 --> 07:59.891
I got 500 condemned seats
out there...

07:59.959 --> 08:01.824
that I can't use
until the stands are fixed.

08:01.895 --> 08:05.490
I got no money to pay for it. So the last
thing I feel like talking about is Mark,

08:05.565 --> 08:09.797
who wants to be a star
even if he kills himself doing it!

08:11.104 --> 08:13.095
Ugghhh.

08:14.908 --> 08:18.844
I'm sorry, Lisa. I guess I'm just a crotchety
old man who should be put out to pasture.

08:18.912 --> 08:22.848
Tsk. Knowing you, you'd probably try
to work up a stunt show with the cows.

08:22.916 --> 08:24.850
Nah. They're too slow.

08:26.419 --> 08:29.513
Lisa. You promised we'd rehearse
the new routine today.

08:29.589 --> 08:32.183
Not now, Mario.

08:32.258 --> 08:34.192
Afraid to be alone with me, huh?

08:34.260 --> 08:37.354
Mario, you've really gotta
stop watching soap operas.

08:37.429 --> 08:39.921
Go find one of your groupies.
I'll catch you later.

08:51.444 --> 08:54.242
Yes, Bonnie. That should
be a perfect calibration.

08:54.314 --> 08:56.782
Then that's it, KITT.

08:56.850 --> 08:59.216
You should be
functioning flawlessly...

08:59.285 --> 09:01.981
at least until that nut
starts abusing you.

09:02.055 --> 09:03.989
Thanks a lot.

09:04.057 --> 09:07.151
Speak of the devil.
I've made a few additions to KITT.

09:07.227 --> 09:09.161
Oh, yeah? Like what?

09:09.229 --> 09:12.824
KITT is now equipped to oxygenate
the interior upon command.

09:12.899 --> 09:15.493
Oh, that should be great
for the morning after.

09:15.568 --> 09:17.536
Funny.

09:17.604 --> 09:21.165
I've also increased the booster power
by about 25 %,

09:21.241 --> 09:24.176
so keep that in mind
when you switch to alternate power.

09:24.244 --> 09:26.610
I will. I will.

09:33.253 --> 09:35.687
You know something, Bonnie?
What?

09:35.755 --> 09:38.155
I-I'd like...

09:39.425 --> 09:42.553
I'm really glad you told me
about those new additions to KITT.

09:44.097 --> 09:47.863
Well, you might need them if you get
caught between a rock and a hard place.

09:47.934 --> 09:49.925
Yeah. I know
what that's like.

09:51.004 --> 09:52.938
What?

09:53.006 --> 09:55.440
Nothing. Nothing. Nothing.

09:55.508 --> 09:59.000
Nothing there. It's nothing.
I'll see you later. Nothing.

11:42.949 --> 11:46.441
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's now time for the grand finale...

11:46.519 --> 11:50.387
of Slammin'Sammy's
Super Stunt Show Spectacular.

11:51.657 --> 11:56.959
The most death-defying, logic-defying,
gravity-defying group of daredevil drivers...

11:57.030 --> 11:59.089
this side of the Mississippi.

12:00.967 --> 12:03.697
One, two, three.

12:24.390 --> 12:28.952
Two, three, four, five, six.

12:37.370 --> 12:40.635
Now, I know you folks
have seen this sorta stuff before,

12:40.706 --> 12:43.573
and maybe even a bit more spectacular,

12:43.643 --> 12:48.239
but Slammin' Sammy is now about to show
you something you've never seen before...

12:48.314 --> 12:51.112
and probably will never see again.

12:53.186 --> 12:56.246
Sammy's going to repeat
the very same stunt you just saw,

12:56.322 --> 13:01.316
only this time
he will try to do it driving blind.

13:03.729 --> 13:07.187
To ensure your complete confidence
in this performance,

13:07.266 --> 13:10.599
we've asked the Reverend Henry Jackson
to inspect the hood...

13:10.670 --> 13:13.537
and secure it on Sammy's helmet.

13:13.606 --> 13:15.540
Actually,
ladies and gentlemen,

13:15.608 --> 13:17.599
the reverend is here
to serve a dual role.

13:17.677 --> 13:20.703
If anything should go wrong
during this stunt,

13:20.780 --> 13:24.546
well, it's always handy
to have a reverend available.

13:24.617 --> 13:26.642
Just a little joke, folks.

13:33.292 --> 13:37.126
One, two, three, four...

13:37.196 --> 13:39.892
Come on, come on.
Get up! Get up!

13:48.407 --> 13:50.671
Go!

14:22.942 --> 14:26.275
Dad.
My leg. Leg.

14:26.345 --> 14:29.837
My leg. Leg.

15:05.117 --> 15:09.178
Whoa! That's terrific.
Thanks.

15:09.255 --> 15:13.351
How's your father doing? Oh, he'll be
okay... Just won't be driving for a while.

15:13.426 --> 15:15.690
Who are you, anyway?
Just a guy looking for a job.

15:15.761 --> 15:18.525
Boy, is your timing incredible,
Mr... Knight. Michael Knight.

15:18.598 --> 15:21.032
Lisa Phillips.
Got no jobs, Mr. Knight.

15:21.100 --> 15:24.194
I don't know. Seems to me
you're short a driver for a while.

15:24.270 --> 15:27.569
Think you can replace my dad?
That's a laugh.

15:27.640 --> 15:29.608
You haven't seen me drive yet.

15:29.675 --> 15:32.542
Look, we can't spare a car
for you to wreck up, Mr. Knight.

15:32.612 --> 15:34.671
That's okay.
I use my own.

15:34.747 --> 15:36.612
Unless you're afraid
I'll wreck your track here.

15:36.682 --> 15:39.617
Okay. Go ahead and show me
what you think you can do.

15:39.685 --> 15:42.051
- You got it. Thanks.
- Hmm.

15:43.956 --> 15:47.221
So who is that? Some nut
wants to be a stunt driver.

15:47.293 --> 15:49.227
Instead of
letting me fill in?

15:49.295 --> 15:51.229
What'd you tell him?

15:51.297 --> 15:53.891
Said we'd look.
Why?

15:53.966 --> 15:55.957
Why not?

16:00.606 --> 16:03.666
How did it go, Michael?
Jury's still out, KITT.

16:03.743 --> 16:05.836
We're about to audition.

16:05.911 --> 16:09.278
Meaning? Meaning we gotta
prove we can perform stunts.

16:09.348 --> 16:13.250
You must be joking. I can easily
outperform those primitive stock machines...

16:13.319 --> 16:15.253
the refer to as "stunt cars."

16:15.321 --> 16:17.346
My data indicates that if you wish,

16:17.423 --> 16:21.985
we could perform a 360-, 540-,
or even a 720-degree turn.

16:22.061 --> 16:26.464
- So?
- There's also a multitude of more advanced evolutions we could perform.

16:26.532 --> 16:29.262
KITT, you're forgetting one
very important element.

16:29.335 --> 16:31.701
We're not supposed to be that good.

16:31.771 --> 16:34.467
Oh.
Now ya got it.

17:31.931 --> 17:34.263
How'd I do?
Not bad for an amateur.

17:34.333 --> 17:37.131
Well, when my life's on the line,
I learn real fast.

17:37.203 --> 17:40.798
- You think you can teach me?
- Yeah. Maybe you'll get us both killed.

17:40.873 --> 17:44.274
- Maybe I won't.
- Maybe we'll give it a shot.

17:44.343 --> 17:47.039
- That a firm maybe?
- Maybe.

17:47.113 --> 17:50.549
You know, there sure are a lot of maybes
in this business, aren't there?

17:50.616 --> 17:55.053
- Listen. You hang in here for a minute and I'll check it out with my dad, okay?
- Okay.

17:59.225 --> 18:01.819
- Hey. You weren't too bad out there.
- Thanks.

18:01.894 --> 18:04.658
Michael Knight.
Mark Phillips.

18:04.730 --> 18:08.826
Uh, Phillips? Oh. Yeah. Lisa's
my sister. Sammy's my dad.

18:10.236 --> 18:13.569
You know, if you join up with us, could
be real tough, you learning them routines.

18:13.639 --> 18:16.107
That's okay.
I got a real smart car.

18:16.175 --> 18:18.871
Well... Well, I guess.

18:19.945 --> 18:23.176
- You wanna see my act?
- Sure, man. Shake it down.

18:23.249 --> 18:25.240
All right.

19:11.797 --> 19:12.695
Whoo!

19:16.902 --> 19:18.836
Ahhh.

19:18.904 --> 19:20.997
Hey. That was terrific.
Hey. Thanks.

19:21.073 --> 19:23.166
When's Sammy gonna put you
in the show? I don't know.

19:23.242 --> 19:25.335
Better be soon. Don't
worry, man. It'll come.

19:25.411 --> 19:27.345
Yeah, well, it's taking long enough.

19:27.413 --> 19:30.007
Mark.
Yeah, Dad?

19:30.082 --> 19:33.381
Thought I told you to change the tires
on Mario's car. I was just getting to it.

19:33.452 --> 19:37.354
Don't give me that. I just saw you hotdogging
around the track. Yeah? What do you think?

19:37.423 --> 19:41.018
I think you better get it in gear and do
what I tell you and don't let it happen again.

19:41.093 --> 19:43.152
Now, do you understand?

19:54.773 --> 19:56.707
You know, your son,
he's really terrific.

19:56.775 --> 19:58.868
Yeah, I know.
He's got a lot of talent.

19:58.944 --> 20:01.378
Why are you so rough on him?

20:01.447 --> 20:05.941
Just trying to teach him some discipline and
responsibility, 'cause I don't want him getting hurt.

20:07.219 --> 20:11.053
Stunt cars are bad enough,
but motorcycles are the pits.

20:11.123 --> 20:13.216
Yeah. Well, I wonder
if he sees it that way.

20:13.292 --> 20:15.385
Well, if he doesn't now,
he will.

20:15.461 --> 20:18.453
It's the way I was taught,
and if it was good enough for...

20:20.466 --> 20:22.263
Who are you, anyway?

20:22.334 --> 20:24.359
Oh, I'm Michael Knight.
I'm your new driver.

20:24.436 --> 20:26.904
- Who says?
- Well, I did, sort of.

20:26.972 --> 20:29.907
I've been looking for... Look.
Whose show is this, anyway?

20:29.975 --> 20:33.240
Yours, Dad. Well, then how
come you're hiring me a driver?

20:33.312 --> 20:36.247
Three reasons. One, we need
a temporary replacement for you.

20:36.315 --> 20:40.251
Two, he's not bad for an amateur. And three,
hey, no one else is applying for the job.

20:40.319 --> 20:42.253
All right, all right.

20:43.322 --> 20:46.416
- So you wanna drive for me, huh?
- Yes, sir. That's the idea.

20:46.492 --> 20:49.984
All right. Then show me
something... Something interesting.

20:50.062 --> 20:52.656
All right.
What would you like to see?

20:52.731 --> 20:56.428
- Oh, uh, how about a little skiing?
- What's "skiing"?

20:58.337 --> 21:00.271
"What's skiing?"

21:00.339 --> 21:02.364
See what I mean?

21:02.441 --> 21:05.103
That's, uh,
driving on two wheels.

21:05.177 --> 21:07.441
Two wheels.
Which ones, right or left?

21:08.614 --> 21:11.549
Oh. Your choice.

21:11.617 --> 21:15.246
Or better still,
why not try it both ways?

21:15.321 --> 21:18.552
Both ways.
Gotcha.

21:18.624 --> 21:20.558
Hey, Dad.
That's not really fair.

21:20.626 --> 21:22.560
Probably nobody
can do it both ways.

21:22.628 --> 21:25.062
Aw, let him find it out for himself...

21:25.130 --> 21:27.121
the hard way.

21:31.570 --> 21:35.404
Ahhh. I guess this time
we better pull out a few stops.

21:35.474 --> 21:39.205
Sammy's not gonna be an easy audience.
I'm yours to command, Michael.

21:39.278 --> 21:42.372
Anything you can think of,
I'm sure I can perform.

21:42.448 --> 21:44.939
You know, I sure do admire your modesty.

21:45.017 --> 21:48.919
Modesty is a state of mind, Michael.
I only deal in facts.

22:03.202 --> 22:06.569
Is this impressive enough?
Let's hope so.

22:08.440 --> 22:11.068
What'd I tell you?

22:11.143 --> 22:15.204
There, Dad. Did you ever see
anyone do that both ways before?

22:23.789 --> 22:26.223
Like that?
Not bad. Not too bad.

22:26.291 --> 22:29.385
Oh, don't let him kid you. You
were great, just great. Thanks.

22:30.629 --> 22:32.893
Well, Sammy? Let's you and
me go up to the office...

22:32.965 --> 22:35.229
and talk about how much
I'm going to underpay you.

22:35.300 --> 22:37.291
All right.

22:40.806 --> 22:42.740
Nice job, Gordon.

22:42.808 --> 22:46.505
We'll get that place by the end of the
month. It's $5 million, cool profit.

22:46.578 --> 22:48.569
Thank you, sir.

22:48.647 --> 22:52.413
With Sammy out of action, we oughta be able
to take him over in about three more weeks.

22:52.484 --> 22:54.577
I sure hope so, Mr. Blake.

22:54.653 --> 22:56.848
Well, you sound like
there might be a problem.

22:56.922 --> 23:00.255
Well, last week
the show was just hanging on.

23:00.325 --> 23:05.285
Then after Sammy's accident, the audience
dried up just as we expected it would, sir.

23:05.364 --> 23:07.730
But...
I don't need the details, Gordon.

23:07.800 --> 23:09.734
Just give me the broad strokes.

23:09.802 --> 23:12.566
Sammy's got himself a new driver, sir.

23:12.638 --> 23:16.472
Doesn't matter. Sammy's the show.
Without him, they're dead.

23:16.542 --> 23:18.533
What if the new guy's good?

23:20.279 --> 23:22.372
I expect you to handle it, Gordon.

23:22.448 --> 23:24.473
If you don't,
I'll find someone who will.

23:24.550 --> 23:26.950
Do you understand?
Yes. Of course, Mr. Blake.

23:27.019 --> 23:29.112
Good. Now get going.

23:31.557 --> 23:34.287
By the side door, if you don't mind.

23:36.795 --> 23:38.786
Yes, sir.

24:36.054 --> 24:38.045
Hey.

24:41.293 --> 24:43.284
Hey!

24:49.802 --> 24:52.293
- Aaah.
- If I were you, buddy,

24:52.371 --> 24:54.965
I'd get out of there
before you get yourself trapped.

24:55.040 --> 24:57.031
Who said that?

25:05.384 --> 25:08.410
Really. Some people are simply too much.

25:13.358 --> 25:15.349
Now, that they've tried to sabotage you,

25:15.427 --> 25:17.759
you know
we must've stirred something up.

25:17.830 --> 25:19.695
Michael, I must confess
I have a difficult time...

25:19.765 --> 25:23.201
computing the logic of this sport,
as you insist on calling it.

25:23.268 --> 25:25.862
- Why?
- On a mathematical basis,

25:25.938 --> 25:28.406
these so-called "stunts"
do present a slight challenge,

25:28.473 --> 25:31.704
but it seems a somewhat pointless
and rather dangerous activity.

25:31.777 --> 25:34.712
- KITT, that's not the point.
- Then what is the point?

25:34.780 --> 25:37.374
People pay money to see the stunts.

25:37.449 --> 25:40.213
Without money,
Sammy's show is going down the drain.

25:40.285 --> 25:44.051
I see. Well, Michael, if our object
is to save this enterprise,

25:44.122 --> 25:46.113
we'd best come up with something
quite exceptional.

25:46.191 --> 25:49.183
- That seems logical.
- What else would it be?

25:49.261 --> 25:52.890
Now that we've got that settled,
what would you suggest we do?

25:52.965 --> 25:55.559
How would I know?
You're talking show business,

25:55.634 --> 25:58.933
and that's completely outside
the scope of any known system of logic.

25:59.004 --> 26:01.268
- You know, what, KITT?
- What, Michael?

26:01.340 --> 26:03.831
Sometimes you're no help at all.

26:03.909 --> 26:06.309
You sure do
understand your capabilities.

26:06.378 --> 26:11.543
Of course I do. But you are the best judge
of what will turn people on, as they say.

26:11.617 --> 26:15.246
I'm afraid this time the ball is
in your court, as they also say.

26:35.107 --> 26:38.372
Whoa! Yeah!

26:38.443 --> 26:40.536
Hi, kid.
Hi, Sammy.

26:40.612 --> 26:42.876
I'm telling you, we're gonna
have a good show this week.

26:42.948 --> 26:45.382
Yeah.

26:45.450 --> 26:47.543
You know, I've been
watching you, Michael,

26:47.619 --> 26:49.553
You're good, real good.

26:49.621 --> 26:51.555
Thanks, Sammy.

26:51.623 --> 26:53.955
What we really need, though,
is a showstopper.

26:54.026 --> 26:57.928
Yeah. I've been thinking about that. How
would you feel about me doing the finale?

26:57.996 --> 27:00.965
My stunt? Ohhh.
No way you can do that blind.

27:01.033 --> 27:03.001
Maybe in a year or two,
but...

27:03.068 --> 27:05.332
Well, do I have to do it blind?

27:05.404 --> 27:09.170
Kid, I'll level with you. Without
the blind finish, the act is nowhere.

27:09.241 --> 27:13.007
As a matter of fact, the whole show isn't
really all that much... not these days.

27:13.078 --> 27:15.546
No, the blind bit's the only thing
keeping us in business...

27:15.614 --> 27:17.548
and that just barely.

27:17.616 --> 27:20.016
What do you think
about a jump over a car and a truck?

27:20.085 --> 27:22.178
Humph. Big deal.

27:22.254 --> 27:24.245
I jump four trucks
just for a buildup.

27:24.323 --> 27:26.791
Yeah, but not while
they're moving in the same direction.

27:26.858 --> 27:29.019
Ohhh, no, no, no.

27:29.094 --> 27:32.029
No, forget that. That's
impossible. I know I can do it.

27:32.097 --> 27:36.033
Oh, the ramp is simple enough, but you couldn't
build up enough speed. How about letting me try?

27:36.101 --> 27:40.299
All you'll end up doing is wrecking a
car and maybe yourself. I'll use my car.

27:40.372 --> 27:42.499
All right.

27:42.574 --> 27:46.510
If you're that determined, give it a try at practice
tomorrow. What about the finale this afternoon?

27:46.578 --> 27:49.979
You said you needed a showstopper,
didn't you? Well, yeah, but I...

27:58.223 --> 28:00.953
Okay, kid, but it's your
neck. Okay! Okay, thanks!

28:11.903 --> 28:15.168
Ahhh. There you go, KITT.

28:15.240 --> 28:17.265
You're starting to look
pretty nifty there, buddy.

28:17.342 --> 28:21.244
Really, Michael.
Is all this garishness really necessary?

28:21.313 --> 28:24.248
Of course it is.
We're in show business now.

28:24.316 --> 28:26.910
You're gonna be a star.
It'll be more appropriate.

28:26.985 --> 28:31.684
Really? But still, I fail to understand how
these stars enhance my functional capabilities.

28:31.757 --> 28:34.920
- That's not the point.
- Then exactly what is the point?

28:36.094 --> 28:38.289
I don't think I can explain it
so you'd understand.

28:38.363 --> 28:40.126
Very weak reasoning.

28:40.198 --> 28:42.860
All right. Look.
Either you get the stars,

28:42.934 --> 28:45.698
or get painted red, white and blue
like all the other cars.

28:45.771 --> 28:49.969
- Now which is it?
- Keep pasting, Michael. Please keep pasting.

28:54.379 --> 28:58.406
Ladies and gentlemen,
one of our drivers will now try...

28:58.483 --> 29:00.883
a jump over two moving vehicles.

29:00.952 --> 29:03.648
A stunt that has been
attempted dozens of times...

29:03.722 --> 29:05.883
by various driving legends,

29:05.957 --> 29:08.824
and they've all been unsuccessful.

29:09.895 --> 29:13.991
We are about to see
stunt driving history...

29:14.066 --> 29:16.159
or witness one hell of a wreck!

29:16.234 --> 29:18.998
All we can say is good luck to Mike!

29:19.071 --> 29:24.168
- Sure we can do this, huh?
- The chances of successful completion are somewhat less that optimum.

29:24.242 --> 29:27.678
What? Why didn't
you tell me that before?

29:27.746 --> 29:29.771
Would it have made any difference?
Well, I...

29:29.848 --> 29:33.682
After all, you're the expert on
showstoppers, as I think you call them.

29:33.752 --> 29:37.153
All I have to do is all the work,
take the punishment,

29:37.222 --> 29:39.156
the abuse of my circuitry, the...

29:39.224 --> 29:42.352
Not now, KITT. Not now.

29:55.273 --> 29:59.300
Thank you! Thank you!

30:22.634 --> 30:26.502
That's some kind of driving, kid. I couldn't
have done better myself. Thanks, Sammy.

30:26.571 --> 30:29.199
Gimme a couple of days for a little
publicity, we'll really pack 'em in.

30:29.274 --> 30:30.764
You got it.

30:30.842 --> 30:32.901
You really turned
this whole show around, Michael.

30:32.978 --> 30:36.141
You know, for a guy who never drove
professionally before, you're incredible.

30:37.649 --> 30:40.083
That was a business kiss,
not a social one.

30:51.596 --> 30:53.587
That was a social one.

31:01.173 --> 31:03.539
Hey. How ya doing?

31:03.608 --> 31:08.545
Name's Bill Gordon, and that was some fantastic
stunt you just pulled off. Thanks. Thanks a lot.

31:08.613 --> 31:11.707
You know, a guy like you could
go a long way in this business.

31:11.783 --> 31:13.717
Think so, huh?
Oh, yeah.

31:13.785 --> 31:17.778
How would you like to be making, say,
50 times what you're making right now?

31:17.856 --> 31:21.383
Keep talking.
I represent a large corporation,

31:21.459 --> 31:25.725
and I think a man with your ability
definitely has a place in our company.

31:25.797 --> 31:28.061
Well, maybe we got
something to talk about after all.

31:28.133 --> 31:32.297
Fine. Fine. Well, let's you and me
take a walk... No, no. Not you and me.

31:32.370 --> 31:35.032
Me and the guy you work for.

31:36.775 --> 31:39.573
I don't know about that.
Yeah? Well, I do.

31:39.644 --> 31:43.444
If I'm as valuable an asset as you
say I am, I don't deal below top dog.

31:43.515 --> 31:46.848
So you touch home base with that
and, uh, let me know.

31:54.960 --> 31:57.758
Yes. I understand completely,
Mr. Prime Minister,

31:57.829 --> 31:59.763
and of course, you're quite right.

31:59.831 --> 32:02.026
Uh, as Henry Kissinger once said,

32:02.100 --> 32:04.193
"Even paranoids have real enemies."

32:05.270 --> 32:07.261
No, he wasn't making a joke.

32:07.339 --> 32:09.637
He was being funny,
but there is a difference.

32:11.042 --> 32:15.035
Uh, yes. All right. I'm sure that by
the time the meeting convenes next month,

32:15.113 --> 32:17.206
the whole thing
will have been worked out.

32:17.282 --> 32:19.341
Uh, yes. See you.
See you very soon.

32:19.417 --> 32:21.248
Good-bye.

32:21.319 --> 32:24.254
Sorry about that. He's the most
insecure man I've ever met.

32:24.322 --> 32:27.155
How he managed to get himself
elected in the first place...

32:27.225 --> 32:30.353
is one of those insoluble
political mysteries.

32:30.428 --> 32:34.296
Well, back to, uh,
the business at hand.

32:34.366 --> 32:36.300
You were saying?

32:36.368 --> 32:38.097
I think they've finally taken the bait.

32:38.169 --> 32:40.103
Oh? And what leads you
to that assumption?

32:40.171 --> 32:44.039
I was approached with an offer
I'm not supposed to be able to refuse.

32:44.109 --> 32:45.940
And, of course, you didn't.

32:46.011 --> 32:48.571
No, I did.
Why?

32:48.647 --> 32:52.879
Well, I'm holding out for a one-on-one
with the top dog, Mr. Blake himself.

32:52.951 --> 32:56.853
And precisely what is he
supposed to do, confess all?

32:56.921 --> 33:00.322
Well, that depends on exactly how badly
he wants to buy me off.

33:00.392 --> 33:03.225
- Well, let's hope you're right.
- Meaning?

33:03.295 --> 33:05.889
Meaning that if he's
that worried about you,

33:05.964 --> 33:09.161
there are cheaper and easier ways
to solve his problem.

33:09.234 --> 33:12.863
Like... terminating
with extreme prejudice.

33:12.937 --> 33:15.064
Yes. That's exactly what I mean.

33:15.140 --> 33:16.630
Yeah.

33:16.708 --> 33:20.644
Yes, that's exactly what I mean.

33:21.713 --> 33:25.046
Waste him. You sure
you want to go that far?

33:25.116 --> 33:27.209
You offered him money, right?
Yeah.

33:28.453 --> 33:31.217
Any two-bit stunt driver
would have grabbed at it.

33:31.289 --> 33:34.816
But not him.
He wants a face-to-face with me. Why?

33:34.893 --> 33:37.054
I don't know, Mr. Blake.

33:37.128 --> 33:39.221
And I don't care.

33:39.297 --> 33:43.393
I don't know who he is or what he wants, but
nobody, and I mean nobody, gets to me direct.

33:44.469 --> 33:47.131
That's what I pay you for...
To run interference.

33:47.205 --> 33:50.231
Now, he doesn't wanna
play ball with you, that's fine.

33:50.308 --> 33:53.641
He doesn't get to play ball at all.
You take care of him.

33:54.813 --> 33:56.747
Quietly.

33:56.815 --> 34:00.911
No, not quietly. Noisy.
Big and noisy.

34:02.087 --> 34:05.579
So you see he has an accident,
a nice fatal accident...

34:05.657 --> 34:10.185
a really for real showstopper,
if you get my point.

34:25.877 --> 34:27.811
Hey! Whoo.

34:27.879 --> 34:31.371
I tell you, this stunt driving stuff
is real thirsty work.

34:31.449 --> 34:33.382
Ah, it's all that dust, kid.

34:33.451 --> 34:35.543
I've been eating it
for damn near 40 years now,

34:35.620 --> 34:39.215
and that's a long time to be living
on burned rubber and carbon monoxide.

34:39.290 --> 34:42.282
Yeah? I always thought
this was a young man's game.

34:42.360 --> 34:45.955
Oh, what do you mean
"young man's game?"

34:46.030 --> 34:49.795
That's only 'cause being crazy and cautious
at the same time is a very rare combination.

34:49.868 --> 34:52.893
Like the pilots used to say. "There's
old pilots and there's bold pilots,

34:52.971 --> 34:54.905
but there's damn few
old, bold pilots."

34:54.973 --> 34:57.999
Dad, why don't you just pack it in?

34:58.076 --> 35:02.740
Do what, sit around, wait to die? This is
the only life I know, the only life I want.

35:02.814 --> 35:08.013
Yeah, but, Sammy, if you sold out... I mean, after
all, this place has gotta be worth a chunk of money.

35:08.086 --> 35:10.680
Yeah. It almost all
belongs to the bank too.

35:10.755 --> 35:12.689
Do I look crazy or something?

35:12.757 --> 35:16.318
You think if I wasn't up to my eyeballs in
hock I wouldn't do something about this place...

35:16.394 --> 35:18.259
like fixing up
that whole section over there?

35:18.329 --> 35:21.457
- Yeah. I see what you mean.
- Now, that's the whole problem, Dad.

35:21.533 --> 35:24.468
Even when things are going great,
we're still just barely getting by.

35:24.536 --> 35:29.701
Now, listen. All I have in this world, all
I have to leave you and Mark is this place!

35:29.774 --> 35:32.038
And maybe you two
can do better with it than I have,

35:32.110 --> 35:35.341
but it's gonna be here
for you to try, okay?

35:35.413 --> 35:37.347
Okay.
Besides,

35:37.415 --> 35:40.282
another couple of weeks, the way Michael's
act is drawing, I'll be home free.

35:40.351 --> 35:43.218
Yeah. I don't know why a
driver as good as you are...

35:43.288 --> 35:46.018
is willing to settle for
a little two-bit operation like ours,

35:46.090 --> 35:48.217
but believe me,
Lisa, Mark and me...

35:48.293 --> 35:51.387
really, really appreciate
what you've been doing for us.

35:51.463 --> 35:54.364
That's okay. Let's just say
it was my pleasure to help.

35:54.432 --> 35:59.460
Wait a minute. You figure you owe me
one, right? Right. Name your price.

35:59.537 --> 36:01.402
Let Mark perform tomorrow.

36:10.582 --> 36:12.550
Okay. Okay.
Okay.

36:12.617 --> 36:14.642
Let's get back to work, huh?
Sure.

36:16.421 --> 36:18.412
But that still don't tell me why.

36:27.499 --> 36:29.433
Only half the money is here.

36:29.501 --> 36:33.733
I asked you to rig up a couple of
accidents that would close that show down.

36:35.173 --> 36:38.506
Hell, Sammy's doing better business now
than before I hired you.

36:38.576 --> 36:41.238
So what do you want me to do?
Take care of Knight.

36:41.312 --> 36:45.715
If Knight goes, the show goes.
If the show goes, you get your money...

36:45.783 --> 36:47.717
plus a five grand bonus.

36:47.785 --> 36:49.719
Well, it ain't gonna be easy.

36:49.787 --> 36:51.880
I already tried to fix his car.

36:51.956 --> 36:54.424
What happened?
Don't ask.

36:54.492 --> 36:57.950
- Try again.
- I'll see what I can do.

36:58.029 --> 37:02.591
You better, 'cause if you don't,
I'm gonna be there to pack you up.

37:02.667 --> 37:05.830
- With what?
- With a big bang...

37:05.904 --> 37:07.895
under the stands.

37:07.972 --> 37:13.000
- I don't want any part of it.
- Just do your job and nothing will happen.

37:13.077 --> 37:15.068
The show can't go on without Knight.

37:15.146 --> 37:17.910
It's up to you.
By the way,

37:17.982 --> 37:20.246
if you're thinking
about backing out of this,

37:21.252 --> 37:23.186
don't...

37:23.254 --> 37:28.419
otherwise, you might find some nasty,
unexpected surprise in your gas tank.

37:42.440 --> 37:44.431
Mark.
Yeah, Dad.

37:45.577 --> 37:49.377
Get your act together.
You're in today's show.

37:49.447 --> 37:51.745
- Right! Thanks!
- Hey!

37:51.816 --> 37:53.306
Oh! Did I hurt you?
No.

37:53.384 --> 37:54.749
You all right?
Yeah.

37:54.819 --> 37:58.687
What made you change your mind? Well,
let's just say I got a little persuasion.

37:58.756 --> 38:01.316
Well, thanks a lot, Dad. I
won't let you down. I know.

38:01.392 --> 38:03.622
Okay.
Mark!

38:03.695 --> 38:06.186
Yeah, Dad?
Wear my helmet...

38:06.264 --> 38:08.630
At least till we get you
a show helmet of your own.

38:08.700 --> 38:11.225
Good luck, kid.

38:30.888 --> 38:34.483
Yeah! Show them how to do it, kid!
Knock 'em dead, Mark!

38:44.435 --> 38:47.404
Yeah!

38:47.472 --> 38:50.441
Whoo! Whoo! Yeah!

39:04.622 --> 39:06.749
You know, Mike,
with this new stunt you're performing,

39:06.824 --> 39:09.987
I realize that you're
actually saving the show for us,

39:10.061 --> 39:13.588
and I just want you to know that I
apologize for being so hostile towards you.

39:13.665 --> 39:15.997
Forget it, Mario.
We're all under a little pressure.

39:25.910 --> 39:27.844
Here's to a good show.

39:27.912 --> 39:31.507
Hey! What is this, teatime?

39:31.582 --> 39:34.176
Come on, Michael.
You're on next. Start getting ready.

39:34.252 --> 39:36.186
Okay. Thanks, Mario.

40:04.215 --> 40:07.048
Yeah.

40:07.118 --> 40:11.054
Ladies and gentlemen,
now we have the main event.

40:11.122 --> 40:15.957
You were great! An impossible stunt
performed successfully only one time...

40:16.027 --> 40:18.291
in the history of mankind.

40:18.362 --> 40:20.489
The man who did it once...

40:20.565 --> 40:23.432
will press his luck
and try to repeat it.

40:23.501 --> 40:26.436
Daredevil driver Michael Knight...

40:26.504 --> 40:31.237
and his faithful car nicknamed... KATT!

40:45.256 --> 40:47.850
Did you hear that announcer?
He called me "KATT."

40:47.925 --> 40:49.859
That's a four- legged feline.

40:49.927 --> 40:52.157
So go complain to your agent, huh?

41:03.107 --> 41:05.541
Michael, we're not at speed
for this maneuver.

41:07.411 --> 41:10.608
Michael, do you understand?

41:15.620 --> 41:18.646
His timing is off. His timing
is off. He's not gonna make it.

41:20.057 --> 41:22.821
Michael,
please hit the automatic pilot.

41:25.429 --> 41:27.329
Showtime!

41:50.454 --> 41:52.718
KITT, oxygen.

41:57.895 --> 42:01.729
It's gotta be Mario.
That's it. Let's go get him!

42:08.739 --> 42:12.766
Hey! Looks like there's
something more in the show, folks.

42:20.618 --> 42:23.951
All right, KITT.
Put me next to him, huh?

42:34.498 --> 42:36.432
You rigged Sammy's
car, didn't you? Yeah.

42:36.500 --> 42:39.435
Attempted murder. That's a long time
in jail, man. Listen, it wasn't all me.

42:39.503 --> 42:41.437
Who you working for?
Bill Gordon.

42:41.505 --> 42:43.905
He said he's gonna plant a bomb. Where?

42:43.975 --> 42:46.637
Where? The transformer. It's
under the stands near Section E.

43:24.615 --> 43:27.140
- Stop!
- Where's the bomb?

43:29.720 --> 43:31.688
It wasn't my idea!
It was Blake's!

43:33.391 --> 43:35.291
Where's the bomb?

43:35.359 --> 43:38.192
It's over there!
It's gonna go off any second!

43:40.398 --> 43:41.922
Thank you.

43:54.512 --> 43:58.107
KITT, you okay? KITT!

43:58.182 --> 44:00.173
We'll discuss that
at a more appropriate time.

44:00.251 --> 44:01.878
All right.

44:13.230 --> 44:16.529
- Who the hell are you?
- You know damn well who I am.

44:16.600 --> 44:18.625
What I want's money, lots of it.

44:18.703 --> 44:20.671
I don't know what you're talking about.

44:20.738 --> 44:23.332
Let's not dance around all day, okay?

44:23.407 --> 44:26.205
I told Gordon
I wanted to talk to you one-on-one...

44:26.277 --> 44:28.541
and instead you had him
try and snuff me out.

44:28.612 --> 44:31.046
Very, very hostile, Mr. Blake.

44:31.115 --> 44:33.140
But as you noticed, it didn't work.

44:33.217 --> 44:37.415
So now I'm here. We talk. The price?
Maybe triple. You get my point?

44:37.488 --> 44:40.355
Assuming I knew
what you were talking about.

44:40.424 --> 44:43.359
What I'm talking about is
I got to Gordon and Mario,

44:43.427 --> 44:46.692
and they unburdened
their somewhat grimy souls to me.

44:48.632 --> 44:51.897
- Does anybody else know about this?
- Nobody. Not yet.

44:51.969 --> 44:54.563
Nobody's gonna know if we make a deal.

44:54.638 --> 44:58.096
Either we deal,
or I take Gordon to the cops.

44:58.175 --> 45:01.076
What'll it take
to make you happy, Knight?

45:01.145 --> 45:05.775
Money. How much
depends on what you want.

45:05.850 --> 45:07.784
You know what I want.

45:08.853 --> 45:13.256
Well, tell me again,
just so we're reading the same book.

45:13.324 --> 45:15.690
I want that show closed down for keeps.

45:15.760 --> 45:18.228
I want that property
and I want it fast.

45:18.295 --> 45:20.126
No restrictions on the methods?

45:20.197 --> 45:23.462
None. Just get it done...
Whatever it takes.

45:23.534 --> 45:28.437
You mean like that so-called
"accident" to Sammy or my "accident"?

45:29.607 --> 45:31.598
Right.

45:32.777 --> 45:36.269
All right.
What exactly do you want, Knight?

45:36.347 --> 45:41.876
I got what I want, Mr. Blake. You got what you
want, KITT? Every word, loud and clear, Michael.

45:41.952 --> 45:44.546
- What is that?
- Well, it's your confession.

45:44.622 --> 45:49.616
You see, in this day, you can't convict on the
uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice, like Gordon,

45:49.693 --> 45:51.684
so we got you on tape.

45:54.899 --> 45:59.063
How much longer are you going to insist
on reveling in chaos and destruction?

45:59.136 --> 46:01.900
It's a tough world out there, Devon.

46:01.972 --> 46:04.270
Hi, Bonnie.
How's it going?

46:04.341 --> 46:06.832
Humph.
Well, the muffler is shot.

46:08.446 --> 46:11.677
But, um, other than that,
the damage is minor.

46:11.749 --> 46:14.513
Oh, good.
Feel better, Devon?

46:14.585 --> 46:18.681
Hey. What are you doing? Removing these
disgusting decals you've defaced KITT with.

46:18.756 --> 46:21.520
Just leave them where they are.
I don't quite understand, Michael.

46:21.592 --> 46:25.858
You've nailed Blake. You've put his whole
operation out of business. The mission is over.

46:25.930 --> 46:30.094
- For you and the Foundation it is, but not for me and KITT.
- I don't quite follow you, Michael.

46:30.167 --> 46:35.195
Whether Blake is in jail or not, Sammy, Mark
and Lisa can't make it without a showstopper.

46:35.272 --> 46:39.299
Until Sammy can drive again, KITT and
I are gonna have to pinch-hit for him.

46:39.376 --> 46:41.276
And how much longer
is that going to take?

46:41.345 --> 46:43.279
Maybe three weeks.
Three weeks!

46:43.347 --> 46:45.440
That's right.

46:45.516 --> 46:48.212
Well, we look forward
to seeing you in three weeks then.

46:48.285 --> 46:50.219
Maybe not.

46:50.287 --> 46:53.882
Why don't you and, uh, Bonbon,
drop by and catch our act?

46:53.958 --> 46:55.892
Huh.

46:58.229 --> 47:00.720
Ahhh. Michael, what do
you think of a stunt...

47:00.798 --> 47:02.857
where I could somersault
end-over-end?

47:02.933 --> 47:04.867
It's never been done before.

47:04.935 --> 47:06.869
Or better still,
how about a flaming chariot?

47:06.937 --> 47:10.998
We could set my wheels on fire and do a jump. At
night it could be quite spectacular, don't you think?

47:11.075 --> 47:16.638
Can't do anything about me. I think
you better consider reprogramming him...

47:16.714 --> 47:19.342
after the job.

47:19.416 --> 47:21.350
How about a double-barrel roll...

47:21.418 --> 47:23.886
or a barrel roll
with a somersault combined?

47:23.954 --> 47:26.752
My data confirms
that a 100-mile-per-hour approach...

47:26.824 --> 47:28.815
to a 48-degree angle...

47:43.107 --> 47:45.905
One man can make a difference, Michael.

47:49.446 --> 47:53.382
Michael Knight,
a lone crusader in a dangerous world,

47:53.450 --> 47:55.941
the world of the Knight Rider.
