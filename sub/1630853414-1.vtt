01:21.960 --> 01:23.640
Mother!

01:26.040 --> 01:29.480
Aren't I terrible?
I am.

01:30.080 --> 01:33.120
Hey... Tinja. Stop!

01:44.720 --> 01:49.160
Hey. No!
You're impossible!

01:58.720 --> 02:02.480
I hope your everyday life
is as lovely as ours.

02:02.560 --> 02:04.240
-Bye-bye!
-Bye-bye!

02:04.320 --> 02:05.800
Bye!

02:27.920 --> 02:30.640
Let's chase it to the window.

02:37.160 --> 02:38.320
All right.

02:38.400 --> 02:39.720
All right.

02:39.800 --> 02:41.760
-Yay!
-Matias. Matias.

02:50.200 --> 02:52.080
Catch it!

02:54.200 --> 02:56.040
No!

03:01.240 --> 03:02.640
Tinja.

03:22.400 --> 03:24.640
-Shall I take it outside?
-Bring it here.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.120
Let me see.

03:35.200 --> 03:38.440
-Be careful. There's glass on the floor.
-Let me see--

03:41.800 --> 03:43.320
Matias, let's go see...

03:43.400 --> 03:45.280
Please take it to the trash, dear.

03:46.600 --> 03:47.680
Organic waste.

04:14.760 --> 04:20.760
HATCHING

04:22.640 --> 04:24.160
Come, come, come.

04:30.560 --> 04:34.720
-Hi! I'm Reetta.
-Tinja. Hi.

04:34.800 --> 04:40.320
We just moved in.
I mean, duh, I'm sure you can tell.

04:44.240 --> 04:47.400
-May I pet it?
-Sure.

04:49.640 --> 04:51.480
Naughty! Roosa!

04:51.960 --> 04:53.440
You can't do that.

04:53.520 --> 04:56.480
I'm sorry.
She's never bitten anyone.

04:56.560 --> 05:01.160
-Did she hurt you?
-No. It was my fault.

05:03.200 --> 05:09.560
<i>Ah, ah, ah, ah
Alli's child</i>

05:09.640 --> 05:12.600
Sing it louder.
Mother, louder.

05:16.200 --> 05:20.400
<i>Ah, ah, ah, ah
Alli's-</i>

05:20.480 --> 05:22.400
Louder.

05:22.920 --> 05:24.880
<i>...child</i>

05:24.960 --> 05:31.280
<i>A little baby bird</i>

05:31.840 --> 05:38.360
<i>Ah, ah, ah, ah
Alli's child</i>

05:38.680 --> 05:44.720
<i>A little baby bird</i>

05:45.200 --> 05:51.480
<i>No father
No mother</i>

05:51.560 --> 05:57.840
<i>No one to take care of you</i>

05:58.360 --> 06:04.600
<i>No father
No mother</i>

06:05.520 --> 06:07.200
He's asleep.

06:16.760 --> 06:20.320
-Is that the new introduction video?
-Yes.

06:20.880 --> 06:22.680
It's still a bit unfinished.

06:25.800 --> 06:31.840
LOVELY EVERYDAY LIFE

06:40.280 --> 06:43.680
Hi, welcome to my blog
Lovely Everyday Life.

06:43.760 --> 06:47.680
I'll show you the everyday life
of an ordinary Finnish family

06:47.760 --> 06:50.400
and how lovely it can be.

06:50.960 --> 06:55.040
I'm a woman
with two children and one man.

06:55.480 --> 06:59.840
My lovely daughter Tinja,
a super gymnast,

06:59.920 --> 07:03.560
<i>will soon have her first competition.</i>

07:03.640 --> 07:07.840
<i>I'm nervous
but incredibly proud of her.</i>

07:13.240 --> 07:14.360
What?

07:15.040 --> 07:19.800
My toes weren't pointed.
They're like this.

07:19.880 --> 07:21.280
They should be like this.

07:22.400 --> 07:25.800
-I'll crop the video so they don't show.
-Okay.

07:32.080 --> 07:36.160
-A new family moved in next door.
-That's nice.

07:36.240 --> 07:40.880
-Have you met them?
-Yes. I mean, their daughter Reetta.

07:40.960 --> 07:43.320
She invited me over tomorrow.

07:44.480 --> 07:47.560
She has a really cute dog.

07:49.200 --> 07:52.320
You said you were going to focus
on the competition.

07:53.000 --> 07:57.800
-Or have you changed your plan?
-No. I'm focusing on it.

08:56.520 --> 08:58.280
I'll help you.

11:08.160 --> 11:09.480
Go already.

11:25.080 --> 11:26.360
Good.

11:27.520 --> 11:31.000
-You still didn't do the flip at the end.
-Yeah.

11:31.080 --> 11:34.240
You're hesitating.
You've gotta trust yourself.

11:34.880 --> 11:37.520
-I'm sorry.
-You don't have to apologize.

11:37.600 --> 11:40.600
But I can't let you compete
if you can't do it.

11:40.680 --> 11:42.840
-I can do it again.
-No more today.

11:43.120 --> 11:44.920
Take it easy now, okay?

11:55.000 --> 11:57.720
-Tinja, are you coming?
-I have to go for a run.

11:57.800 --> 11:59.320
Don't go.

11:59.880 --> 12:02.320
Why did you even ask?
She wouldn't come anyway.

12:03.440 --> 12:04.560
Have fun!

12:56.640 --> 12:59.800
Hi. This is Tero.

13:00.240 --> 13:02.320
-Hi.
-Hi.

13:07.560 --> 13:10.200
Why don't you get out
of your gymnastics clothes, sweetie.

13:15.040 --> 13:18.160
-Hi.
-Hi.

13:18.240 --> 13:21.080
-How was practice?
-Really good.

13:21.880 --> 13:22.920
Good.

13:23.760 --> 13:25.600
I have a surprise for you.

13:27.000 --> 13:30.760
-I love it.
-You've gotta shine in the competition.

13:38.440 --> 13:39.920
You saw us.

13:44.040 --> 13:50.280
Sometimes adults have these...
special friends.

13:51.200 --> 13:56.240
-But what about Dad?
-Well... Dad is Dad.

13:56.800 --> 14:00.680
-You know what he's like.
-Yeah.

14:02.080 --> 14:05.520
How about we keep this between us?
All right?

14:06.120 --> 14:08.880
I'm going away for a couple of days.

14:12.120 --> 14:15.880
But remember, this is between us girls.

14:49.360 --> 14:52.320
Hi. It smells good in here.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.920
Oh, my, it looks so beautiful here.

14:58.680 --> 15:01.320
Mother! Mother!
We made waffles for you.

15:01.400 --> 15:05.520
Yeah. Okay, that's enough.

15:05.600 --> 15:07.400
Hey, Matias, that's enough.

15:09.080 --> 15:12.680
Great. Now both of our clothes
are ruined.

15:16.280 --> 15:19.640
-Did you have a nice business trip?
-Yes, it was lovely.

15:31.520 --> 15:32.720
Hi.

15:34.200 --> 15:38.360
-Well? What's up, Tinja?
-Nothing.

15:42.640 --> 15:47.000
-Did Mother tell you about the trip?
-Yeah.

15:49.240 --> 15:53.320
She said
it was a really good blog seminar.

15:53.400 --> 15:54.720
That's nice.

15:56.640 --> 16:00.000
-I bought a new one. Look.
-It's nice.

16:04.840 --> 16:06.080
Okay.

16:51.920 --> 16:54.120
-Good.
-Good job, Tinja.

16:54.200 --> 16:56.120
You're getting there.

16:56.200 --> 16:58.760
There's still one spot
in the competition.

16:59.520 --> 17:02.480
And our last one.
What was your name?

17:02.560 --> 17:03.840
Reetta.

17:04.440 --> 17:07.240
-Hi!
-I can't believe this.

17:07.880 --> 17:09.840
Okay, Reetta, go.

17:29.720 --> 17:32.600
Yes. That was perfect.

17:39.040 --> 17:41.280
Yes. Let's do it again.

17:45.200 --> 17:46.760
Yes. And again.

17:47.040 --> 17:48.320
And again.

17:48.400 --> 17:49.760
And again.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.920
All right, Tinja.
Let's do it one more time.

18:02.720 --> 18:05.920
-I should lock up.
-We'll take care of it.

18:07.360 --> 18:10.600
-Don't overdo it, Tinja.
-I'm okay.

18:13.360 --> 18:15.400
Okay, let's do it one more time.

18:21.760 --> 18:24.080
Good. That's it.

18:24.160 --> 18:26.480
Tuck your pelvis in.
Straighten your back.

18:26.560 --> 18:29.480
Symmetrical arms, no hunched back.

18:30.200 --> 18:32.360
Remember your chin.
Good job, Tinja.

18:32.440 --> 18:35.960
You know, I was thinking
of live streaming the competition.

19:03.760 --> 19:07.120
Everything's okay.
I'll take care of you.

19:30.600 --> 19:33.720
We had
a really authentic moment there.

19:34.400 --> 19:36.680
People love them.

19:42.320 --> 19:43.560
Hey...

19:47.600 --> 19:49.560
May I confess something?

19:56.960 --> 19:58.480
I think...

19:59.280 --> 20:00.920
I'm in love.

20:05.240 --> 20:06.560
I mean...

20:08.040 --> 20:12.560
for so many years,
I've only given to people

20:13.600 --> 20:16.160
and thought
that's what women have to do.

20:16.240 --> 20:17.760
But this...

20:19.080 --> 20:20.520
This is just...

20:22.160 --> 20:25.880
Tero is the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

20:26.520 --> 20:29.960
This is the first time in my life

20:30.040 --> 20:34.720
I feel that I really love someone.

20:36.680 --> 20:40.080
I have to see where it takes me.

20:40.520 --> 20:44.480
-Do you understand?
-Yes, of course.

20:47.040 --> 20:48.600
I knew you would.

20:51.040 --> 20:54.560
Sweetie, I'll be away next weekend too.

23:15.400 --> 23:16.480
Tinja.

23:17.440 --> 23:18.760
Is everything okay?

23:24.960 --> 23:26.160
What happened?

23:27.880 --> 23:29.160
Tinja.

23:32.440 --> 23:33.680
Tinja.

23:36.520 --> 23:38.320
What happened? Are you okay?

23:38.400 --> 23:39.800
A bird.

23:39.880 --> 23:41.480
A bird came in.

23:51.840 --> 23:53.360
I think it was wounded.

23:56.320 --> 24:00.160
-What kind of bird was it?
-I don't know.

24:00.240 --> 24:02.120
A really big one.

27:20.120 --> 27:22.440
What are you doing in there?

27:24.520 --> 27:27.560
-Go away!
-I have to pee.

27:27.640 --> 27:31.000
-Go outside.
-I'm scared.

27:32.000 --> 27:33.480
Ouch, Tinja!

27:35.280 --> 27:37.040
Go away.

27:49.560 --> 27:53.200
<i>Ah, ah, ah, ah</i>

27:53.280 --> 27:57.000
<i>Alli's child</i>

27:57.080 --> 28:03.880
<i>Poor little orphan</i>

28:04.840 --> 28:11.840
<i>Ah, ah, ah, ah
Alli's child</i>

28:12.240 --> 28:19.240
<i>Poor little orphan</i>

31:01.000 --> 31:03.200
-What's that smell?
-Tinja is a shithead.

31:03.280 --> 31:06.920
Matias, let's see what Tinja has to say.

31:07.520 --> 31:08.680
What?

31:10.560 --> 31:12.200
What are you...

31:14.720 --> 31:19.160
So... you didn't let Matias use
the bathroom last night.

31:19.240 --> 31:21.080
Tinja is a shithead.

31:21.160 --> 31:24.120
We didn't come here
looking for conflict.

31:24.200 --> 31:29.320
-Matias peed in his bed.
-Okay, I'll change the sheets.

31:29.400 --> 31:32.480
-Tinja went outside last night.
-What?

31:33.440 --> 31:36.760
-You did?
-No. Was there anything else?

31:37.240 --> 31:40.520
I guess not. I mean...

31:44.800 --> 31:46.000
Oh...

31:47.200 --> 31:49.360
Yes. Right.

31:50.640 --> 31:54.200
Yes. I see.

31:55.160 --> 31:56.480
Let's go.

32:22.520 --> 32:26.200
-Do you have a bird?
-No.

32:27.320 --> 32:29.920
I mean, we might get one.

32:32.440 --> 32:34.160
Why didn't you come today?

32:34.560 --> 32:38.120
-Where?
-To practice.

32:38.520 --> 32:40.880
I... I forgot.

32:41.440 --> 32:42.920
She's so weird.

32:47.120 --> 32:49.080
Do you want to walk home with me?

32:51.840 --> 32:57.240
Then a terrible storm started.
The waves were this high.

32:57.320 --> 33:00.920
They went like this.
It was unbelievable.

33:11.640 --> 33:13.480
Can you help me post these?

33:17.680 --> 33:21.000
-Roosa ran away last night.
-Oh.

33:23.160 --> 33:25.080
I mean, oh, no.

33:27.680 --> 33:31.760
MISSING: ROOSA

33:34.360 --> 33:36.360
Hi. There you are.

33:42.360 --> 33:43.520
Ta-dah.

33:45.080 --> 33:46.520
What did you bring me?

33:47.600 --> 33:49.480
Thanks. This is really nice.

33:49.560 --> 33:54.080
-What did you bring me?
-Oh, honey, I didn't get you anything.

33:57.600 --> 33:59.960
Your beautiful hair is so tangled.

34:09.480 --> 34:12.120
Your hair has gotten so long.

34:19.040 --> 34:20.160
Matias.

34:21.000 --> 34:22.120
What on earth...

34:22.200 --> 34:25.000
This is the neighbor's dog.
Tinja buried it.

34:25.080 --> 34:28.600
-Where did you dig it up?
-Tinja killed it.

34:29.080 --> 34:31.520
-Some animal mauled it.
-Tinja did it.

34:31.600 --> 34:34.640
-Matias, stop lying.
-Go to your room.

34:36.360 --> 34:37.600
Now!

35:38.360 --> 35:41.400
Tinja. Tinja.

35:43.040 --> 35:44.240
Tinja.

35:56.280 --> 35:57.680
What happened?

36:06.600 --> 36:07.840
Mother!

36:08.760 --> 36:11.560
You can't do that! Understand?

36:11.640 --> 36:12.920
Do you understand?

36:14.240 --> 36:17.720
-Who are you talking to?
-Myself.

36:28.800 --> 36:30.160
What...

36:40.480 --> 36:43.200
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

36:45.360 --> 36:50.640
-What's that smell?
-It's... It's the dog.

37:01.560 --> 37:03.960
-What is this?
-I don't know.

37:05.240 --> 37:07.720
Who did this? Matias?

37:09.920 --> 37:14.200
-Tell me.
-No, it was an accident.

37:19.520 --> 37:22.840
Mother, are you angry at me?

37:24.640 --> 37:28.720
I thought the competition was
as important to you as it is to me.

37:41.280 --> 37:43.320
I already told you no!

39:54.520 --> 39:56.720
Did you say "Alli"?

39:59.440 --> 40:00.640
Tinja.

40:02.320 --> 40:03.800
Alli.

40:12.720 --> 40:14.440
Are you cold?

41:02.040 --> 41:03.640
Tinja.

43:02.640 --> 43:05.640
Mother, Tinja is a monster!

43:07.800 --> 43:10.080
You had another nightmare.

43:10.160 --> 43:13.240
It wasn't a nightmare.
It's real.

43:19.080 --> 43:20.280
Hi.

43:54.240 --> 43:55.600
Look.

44:10.480 --> 44:12.200
You're beautiful.

44:20.320 --> 44:21.400
Thanks.

44:21.480 --> 44:24.600
-Then Reetta. Tinja, spot her.
-I don't need a spotter.

44:31.120 --> 44:32.480
That's it.

44:35.160 --> 44:39.000
I'll go see my old classmates.

44:39.080 --> 44:42.120
We haven't seen each other
in such a long time.

44:42.200 --> 44:43.800
I miss them so much.

44:44.720 --> 44:46.640
Did you find your dog already?

44:48.560 --> 44:49.800
Oh, no.

44:51.440 --> 44:55.000
-But, hey, you were really good.
-Thanks.

44:55.080 --> 44:57.280
Would you also like to be
in the competition?

44:57.360 --> 44:59.080
Yes, if I'm qualified.

45:00.160 --> 45:04.280
That means Tinja has to practice
super hard if she wants to beat you.

45:04.360 --> 45:05.520
Right, Tinja?

45:20.480 --> 45:22.640
-Do you want a ride?
-No, I'll walk.

45:22.720 --> 45:26.240
-I can take you home.
-I like walking. See you!

46:07.800 --> 46:09.080
Mother.

46:09.160 --> 46:10.520
Let's turn back.

46:10.600 --> 46:12.480
Mother, let's turn back.

47:05.640 --> 47:06.880
Tinja.

47:07.400 --> 47:09.080
What's the matter with you?

47:16.280 --> 47:17.680
Tinja.

47:20.040 --> 47:22.000
Everything's okay.

47:22.080 --> 47:25.320
I understand. I know.

47:28.920 --> 47:32.520
I was also very nervous
before my skating competitions.

47:33.400 --> 47:35.200
It was very stressful.

47:35.600 --> 47:38.000
Do you know the best way
to get rid of the stress?

47:38.080 --> 47:39.280
What?

47:39.360 --> 47:41.280
Winning the competition.

47:41.360 --> 47:44.520
Show everybody you're the best, right?

47:47.160 --> 47:50.200
If you know you're going to win,
they'll know it too.

47:50.280 --> 47:53.080
When you win,
you don't have to worry about anything.

47:57.800 --> 47:59.240
I have an idea.

47:59.920 --> 48:03.280
Being home is
clearly very stressful for you.

48:03.360 --> 48:07.720
So why don't we spend the weekend
at Tero's?

48:07.800 --> 48:09.360
What do you say?

48:14.040 --> 48:15.320
Alli!

48:45.040 --> 48:46.280
Here you go.

48:48.720 --> 48:50.200
Have you lost weight?

48:50.960 --> 48:53.560
You've gotten rid
of the last bits of baby fat.

48:54.600 --> 48:58.200
When you're done eating, get ready.

48:59.440 --> 49:01.640
We'll go to Tero's house, you and me.

49:19.840 --> 49:22.520
Your mother is so strong-willed.

49:25.160 --> 49:30.840
I've always respected
her knowing what she wants.

49:34.760 --> 49:38.200
-It's easy being with someone like that.
-Yeah.

49:42.000 --> 49:43.760
Tero is a good man.

49:45.160 --> 49:46.640
I mean, person.

50:35.880 --> 50:37.600
Isn't this lovely?

50:59.520 --> 51:01.040
Oh, hi.

51:01.960 --> 51:03.560
Nice to meet you.

51:03.640 --> 51:06.560
I mean, we saw each other already.

51:07.440 --> 51:09.200
But it's great you could come.

51:11.960 --> 51:16.400
-You look identical.
-Mother has such a great style.

51:16.880 --> 51:18.240
That's true.

51:18.880 --> 51:22.600
Welcome and make yourself at home.

51:22.960 --> 51:24.680
Isn't this a lovely house?

51:24.760 --> 51:26.800
It's a bit of a fixer-upper, but...

51:28.000 --> 51:29.280
Hi.

51:30.960 --> 51:32.480
Do you want to see your room?

51:34.800 --> 51:36.680
Let's go meet Helmi first.

51:36.760 --> 51:39.200
Come, let's go.

51:46.520 --> 51:49.160
Who do we have here?

51:51.720 --> 51:53.720
Isn't she sweet?

51:54.320 --> 51:57.560
A little princess.

51:58.240 --> 52:01.200
You're so well-behaved and beautiful.

52:03.360 --> 52:04.880
Tero is a widower.

52:04.960 --> 52:07.200
Helmi's mother died in childbirth.

52:07.280 --> 52:09.640
But you have us now, don't you?

52:09.720 --> 52:11.000
Yeah.

52:12.280 --> 52:13.960
Oh.

53:17.280 --> 53:19.000
Everything's okay.

53:23.600 --> 53:25.680
Move your hands into the shot.

53:27.200 --> 53:28.680
That's it.

53:29.160 --> 53:31.520
Do you really have to photograph
everything?

53:33.400 --> 53:35.920
I might not want to show my house
to the whole world.

53:36.000 --> 53:38.360
No one will know I took these here.

53:38.440 --> 53:40.720
Look. I cropped you out.

53:43.600 --> 53:47.040
Are you a sweet little princess?
Are you?

53:47.480 --> 53:49.960
Here we go. Let's put this on you.

53:50.040 --> 53:54.360
You're so cute in this lovely outfit.

53:56.000 --> 53:57.400
Yes, you are.

54:02.720 --> 54:04.000
Hi.

54:07.160 --> 54:08.360
Yes?

54:09.560 --> 54:11.160
Eat, by all means.

54:13.120 --> 54:14.520
Yes.

54:17.720 --> 54:19.360
Where?

54:25.840 --> 54:27.840
-You like it?
-Yeah.

54:29.840 --> 54:32.480
Oh, don't worry about it.

54:34.480 --> 54:37.160
Look. What if I do like this?

54:37.240 --> 54:38.640
-Oops.
-Yeah.

54:38.720 --> 54:40.800
Oh, my gosh.

54:42.480 --> 54:45.720
Helmi, let's show her our table manners.

54:46.080 --> 54:47.560
Oops.

54:47.880 --> 54:51.720
I see. I mean, that's terrible.

55:26.440 --> 55:27.760
Reetta.

55:49.960 --> 55:54.400
That's so awful,
with the competition coming and all.

55:55.240 --> 55:58.840
But the most important thing
is that you don't let this affect you.

56:24.280 --> 56:27.520
Why did you do that? Why?

56:43.280 --> 56:45.440
Let me go, Alli!

56:45.520 --> 56:46.840
Let me go!

58:04.400 --> 58:05.960
What's on your mind?

58:06.040 --> 58:09.440
I was just looking at the chair.

58:09.520 --> 58:12.840
-It's nice.
-Yeah. I found it in a dumpster.

58:13.320 --> 58:16.720
People don't treat their things well.

58:17.080 --> 58:22.120
I like fixing them,
broken things like this.

58:26.920 --> 58:28.440
Hey. Um...

58:29.120 --> 58:33.160
I was going to give you these later,

58:33.240 --> 58:37.200
but I'll give them to you now,
since the competition is coming and all.

58:37.280 --> 58:38.760
Thank you.

58:44.160 --> 58:45.960
This is a cartwheel.

58:51.720 --> 58:53.440
This is an aerial cartwheel.

58:59.160 --> 59:00.800
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

59:02.720 --> 59:04.280
Wait, I'll do it again.

59:10.680 --> 59:13.800
-I can do better.
-You don't have to do it now.

59:21.240 --> 59:23.640
-I can do better.
-It doesn't matter.

59:23.960 --> 59:25.400
What do you mean?

59:25.960 --> 59:28.320
Tinja, do you really like gymnastics?

59:28.400 --> 59:31.480
-It's a good sport.
-Yes...

59:33.160 --> 59:36.480
I guess it's important for your mother
that you do well in it.

59:39.280 --> 59:40.520
Hey...

59:42.360 --> 59:44.400
Do you want to see me do a cartwheel?

59:55.400 --> 59:58.880
-What was that?
-I'll go change.

1:00:29.440 --> 1:00:30.920
Is everything okay?

1:00:42.680 --> 1:00:44.240
Tinja, open the door.

1:00:56.920 --> 1:00:58.080
Tinja...

1:01:00.360 --> 1:01:02.160
Why don't I call your mother now?

1:01:07.760 --> 1:01:10.320
Tinja! Tinja!

1:01:11.760 --> 1:01:13.440
Open the door!

1:01:16.040 --> 1:01:18.160
Let go!

1:01:23.160 --> 1:01:24.760
No! Stop!

1:01:36.480 --> 1:01:38.200
Do you have anything to say?

1:01:40.080 --> 1:01:42.520
I packed already.

1:01:42.880 --> 1:01:45.400
I can leave when Mother comes or...

1:01:48.960 --> 1:01:51.960
I can take the bus home if you want.

1:01:53.360 --> 1:01:55.720
You'll never have to see me again.

1:02:03.480 --> 1:02:05.000
No one's going anywhere now.

1:02:05.080 --> 1:02:07.160
You must think I'm a horrible person.

1:02:08.080 --> 1:02:09.920
You're not a horrible person.

1:02:10.520 --> 1:02:13.120
I mean, you were a bit a moment ago.

1:02:13.200 --> 1:02:14.880
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1:02:14.960 --> 1:02:16.240
Hey.

1:02:17.280 --> 1:02:18.920
It's okay.

1:02:20.360 --> 1:02:21.920
Apology accepted.

1:02:26.760 --> 1:02:29.560
Maybe you've had a bit too much
to process lately.

1:02:34.040 --> 1:02:37.600
-We'll talk about this with your mother.
-No, don't tell her.

1:02:37.680 --> 1:02:41.480
Don't say anything to her.
I'll do anything.

1:02:43.920 --> 1:02:46.640
Was that because of the competition?

1:02:47.880 --> 1:02:51.760
No. I mean...

1:02:55.000 --> 1:02:56.280
You can tell me.

1:02:59.720 --> 1:03:02.280
Hi! Are you ready?

1:03:03.520 --> 1:03:06.240
Let's check your poses,
and then we'll go.

1:03:06.960 --> 1:03:09.720
I'll start filming
when you start stretching.

1:03:11.560 --> 1:03:13.120
What happened to your hand?

1:03:15.360 --> 1:03:18.000
I had an accident in the workshop.

1:03:18.080 --> 1:03:21.520
Honey, I've told you to be careful
with your tools.

1:03:22.160 --> 1:03:23.640
All right, let's go.

1:03:25.840 --> 1:03:28.920
Remember to point your toes
like you showed me.

1:03:33.000 --> 1:03:34.640
Cover your ears.

1:03:34.720 --> 1:03:36.880
Hey, seriously.

1:03:36.960 --> 1:03:39.880
Tinja, you can do better. Hey.

1:03:46.720 --> 1:03:49.760
Tinja, it's only a question of focus.

1:03:52.200 --> 1:03:54.120
I'm sorry, honey.

1:03:54.680 --> 1:03:56.400
Did we wake you up?

1:03:58.760 --> 1:04:02.360
Was Tinja too loud? Was she?

1:04:04.600 --> 1:04:07.760
Who's Mother's darling baby? Who?

1:04:08.160 --> 1:04:09.280
Who?

1:04:12.440 --> 1:04:14.200
All right, Tinja, we gotta go.

1:04:16.360 --> 1:04:18.160
Good luck!

1:04:18.240 --> 1:04:20.240
Are you... Isn't Helmi coming?

1:04:20.320 --> 1:04:22.120
No, Tero and Helmi will stay here.

1:04:22.200 --> 1:04:25.640
-Helmi has to come with us.
-Tinja, we're in a hurry.

1:04:25.720 --> 1:04:29.400
-Helmi has to come with us.
-We'll be late for the competition.

1:04:29.960 --> 1:04:32.080
We need to talk.

1:04:33.280 --> 1:04:35.840
Tinja, say bye to Helmi.

1:04:35.920 --> 1:04:37.440
Bye bye, Helmi.

1:05:12.080 --> 1:05:14.760
Please go sit in the audience.

1:05:16.560 --> 1:05:17.880
Tinja.

1:05:28.640 --> 1:05:30.240
Matias.

1:05:49.320 --> 1:05:52.280
Alli, don't. Alli, don't.

1:05:52.360 --> 1:05:53.480
Alli, don't.

1:05:54.320 --> 1:05:56.760
You're last. Bring it.

1:06:03.200 --> 1:06:04.400
Tinja.

1:07:26.760 --> 1:07:29.000
-Does this hurt?
-No.

1:07:29.560 --> 1:07:31.400
I don't think it's fractured.

1:07:35.240 --> 1:07:36.480
Let's go.

1:07:40.040 --> 1:07:41.440
Her wrist?

1:08:02.600 --> 1:08:04.240
-Tero.
-Shut up.

1:08:04.640 --> 1:08:06.040
Tero, what are you--

1:08:06.120 --> 1:08:08.080
Do you understand
what your daughter has done?

1:08:08.160 --> 1:08:10.000
Tinja?
When?

1:08:10.080 --> 1:08:12.080
Now. A moment ago.

1:08:12.160 --> 1:08:13.960
We just came from the competition.

1:08:16.480 --> 1:08:18.080
Have you been drinking?

1:08:19.920 --> 1:08:23.040
-Go to hell.
-Why are you talking like that?

1:08:23.120 --> 1:08:24.880
I said we were at the competition.

1:08:24.960 --> 1:08:28.640
I don't care where you were,
but you're not coming here.

1:08:28.720 --> 1:08:32.520
-What?
-You only see yourself, huh?

1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:35.360
Your daughter has
some serious problems,

1:08:35.440 --> 1:08:37.280
and I want nothing to do with them.

1:08:39.280 --> 1:08:40.640
Wait here.

1:08:41.680 --> 1:08:43.080
Tero.

1:08:48.760 --> 1:08:50.520
Where are you?

1:09:17.560 --> 1:09:18.840
Mother.

1:09:49.120 --> 1:09:53.480
I wished you would
at least let me be happy.

1:10:29.760 --> 1:10:31.680
What are you doing home so early?

1:10:32.400 --> 1:10:33.680
What?

1:10:33.760 --> 1:10:36.480
-Well, Tinja insisted.
-What--

1:10:44.680 --> 1:10:46.240
You lost.

1:10:49.880 --> 1:10:51.320
It's good to have you home.

1:11:16.440 --> 1:11:17.880
Go away.

1:11:22.160 --> 1:11:24.000
No. Don't.

1:11:24.720 --> 1:11:27.320
I want you to stop doing things.

1:11:39.640 --> 1:11:40.920
Tinja.

1:11:42.160 --> 1:11:43.880
What are you doing there?

1:12:03.560 --> 1:12:05.040
Hi, everyone.

1:12:05.720 --> 1:12:07.880
I just wanted to do an update

1:12:07.960 --> 1:12:11.400
since my live broadcast ended
so dramatically.

1:12:17.800 --> 1:12:19.400
Hi, everyone.

1:12:19.480 --> 1:12:21.280
Tinja is doing well,

1:12:21.360 --> 1:12:25.760
and we want to thank you,
every one of you,

1:12:25.840 --> 1:12:28.240
for your loving messages and support

1:12:28.320 --> 1:12:32.400
and for being so wonderful to us.

1:12:32.480 --> 1:12:34.640
You're part of our family.

1:12:42.600 --> 1:12:44.120
Hi, everyone.

1:12:44.720 --> 1:12:48.480
I know I always say
how lovely everything is,

1:12:48.560 --> 1:12:54.400
but an equally important part
of our everyday lives is failing.

1:13:00.680 --> 1:13:01.960
Mother.

1:13:04.440 --> 1:13:05.720
What?

1:13:06.200 --> 1:13:11.080
I can be better. I can do it.

1:13:11.440 --> 1:13:12.880
You smell.

1:13:24.640 --> 1:13:25.800
Tinja.

1:13:45.880 --> 1:13:47.640
What are you doing here?

1:13:48.480 --> 1:13:49.880
Come. I need you.

1:13:55.240 --> 1:13:57.640
Your hair looks terrible.

1:14:01.280 --> 1:14:02.800
Look at yourself.

1:14:07.600 --> 1:14:10.400
How can you be so disgusting?

1:14:49.080 --> 1:14:50.680
Tinja, let go of me!

1:14:57.320 --> 1:15:01.800
Tinja. Tinja. Let go!

1:15:27.120 --> 1:15:28.680
Go away!

1:15:30.160 --> 1:15:31.960
You hear me? Leave!

1:15:33.560 --> 1:15:34.840
I don't want you!

1:15:36.400 --> 1:15:38.360
No one wants you!

1:16:10.080 --> 1:16:11.200
What...

1:16:13.280 --> 1:16:14.680
What was that?

1:16:15.920 --> 1:16:18.520
I... I hatched it.

1:16:20.440 --> 1:16:22.520
Everything's its fault.

1:16:24.960 --> 1:16:27.800
I just want it to go away.

1:16:33.120 --> 1:16:35.040
Oh, baby.

1:16:39.400 --> 1:16:42.880
Mother's sweet little girl.

1:16:44.360 --> 1:16:46.320
Mother's darling.

1:18:06.080 --> 1:18:07.240
Is everything okay?

1:18:12.760 --> 1:18:15.760
There's someone here.

1:18:16.360 --> 1:18:17.720
Don't ask what.

1:18:19.720 --> 1:18:23.160
It looks like Tinja, but it's not Tinja.

1:18:24.120 --> 1:18:26.800
Everything is its fault.

1:18:27.320 --> 1:18:29.800
We'll take care of it,
and everything will be okay.

1:18:29.880 --> 1:18:33.840
-It wasn't a nightmare.
-You're right, honey.

1:18:35.080 --> 1:18:36.680
Keep an eye on Matias.

1:19:42.960 --> 1:19:44.160
No!

1:19:56.920 --> 1:19:58.120
Mother.

1:19:58.680 --> 1:19:59.800
We got it.

1:20:03.880 --> 1:20:05.400
What are you going to do?

1:20:06.280 --> 1:20:08.360
You wanted to get rid of it, didn't you?

1:20:09.560 --> 1:20:11.640
Yes, but...

1:20:25.280 --> 1:20:26.960
I hatched it.

1:20:28.400 --> 1:20:30.360
Everything will be okay.

1:20:31.720 --> 1:20:33.040
No!

1:21:03.760 --> 1:21:07.200
No. No. No. No.

1:21:26.480 --> 1:21:27.720
Tinja.

1:22:13.520 --> 1:22:16.640
Moth-er.
