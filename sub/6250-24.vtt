02:03.082 --> 02:05.289
Uh, good morning.
I’m Vernon Warner,
dean of students.

02:05.376 --> 02:07.412
Special Agent Seeley Booth.
This here is
Dr. Temperance Brennan...

02:07.545 --> 02:10.287
from the jeffersonian.
There is a lot ofdamage
to this body.

02:10.381 --> 02:12.918
They had a cannon.
More like a blunderbuss, really,

02:13.009 --> 02:15.546
filled to the brim
with bric-a-brac and shrapnel.

02:15.636 --> 02:17.922
Yeah. Look, I suspect that
this might be a prank.

02:18.014 --> 02:19.720
- A prank?
- Well, it’s college, Bones.

02:19.807 --> 02:22.344
/-/ suspect that one
of our less reﬂective
frat houses...

02:22.435 --> 02:24.926
may have stolen
these remains from
the, uh, medical school.

02:25.021 --> 02:27.728
Beta Delta Sigma.
We got a missing
cao’a ver report yesterday.

02:27.815 --> 02:30.978
I’ll tell you what, Bones.
When I was in college, my frat—
we stole a cadaver,

02:31.068 --> 02:33.525
dressed it up like Caesar
and put it on
the statue ofa horse.

02:33.612 --> 02:37.230
Would this, by any chance,
be a fraternity
of sociopaths?

02:37.325 --> 02:40.032
But ifthe Betas did
do this, / Will Witho’ra W
their ce/t/ﬁ'ca tion.

02:40.119 --> 02:42.360
The stolen cadaver
was male, 73 years old.

02:42.455 --> 02:45.743
His snowmobile fell
through the ice.
Donated his body to science.

02:45.833 --> 02:48.290
Yeah. Snowmobilers
and motorcyclists are
our main source of cadavers.

02:48.377 --> 02:50.754
No.

02:50.838 --> 02:52.749
The third molar
has not fully erupted.

02:52.840 --> 02:55.456
I’d be surprised if
he was older than mid-20$.

02:56.635 --> 02:59.047
So this is not
the missing cadaver?

02:59.138 --> 03:02.050
I think you’ll find your
missing medical school cadaver
is over there.

03:02.183 --> 03:03.593
Where?
[Brennan]
Sitt/ng on the bleachers.

03:03.684 --> 03:05.515
He hasn ’t moved
since we got here.

03:05.603 --> 03:08.845
No, that’sjust campus security.
They’re always like that.

03:08.939 --> 03:13.979
- But I’ll go check it out.
- So if he is not
a stolen cadaver, then, uh—

03:14.070 --> 03:16.607
He wasn’t alive when our students
shot him with the cannon, was he?

03:16.697 --> 03:19.655
I won’t know cause ofdeath
until I get him back to the lab.

03:19.742 --> 03:24.281
Yeah, she ’5 right.
it’s your cao’a ver.
He reeks of formaldehyde.

03:24.372 --> 03:29.116
Okay. Let’s get it all back
to the jefferson/an, shall we?

03:30.461 --> 03:32.622
Looks like someone
took a ﬂamethrower
to Sasquatch.

03:32.713 --> 03:34.999
Well, this is what
he was supposed
to look like.

03:35.091 --> 03:37.332
Someone finally
killed a mascot?

- [Device Beeps]
- [Chuckles]

03:39.512 --> 03:41.719
Mr. Vaziri,
do you have the X-rays?
Yes.

03:41.806 --> 03:45.765
I have never seen
so many foreign objects
in human remains.

03:45.851 --> 03:50.185
Arrows, marbles, “jack,”
various coins, cutlery.

03:50.272 --> 03:53.014
My best guess is
a nuclear explosion occurred...

03:53.109 --> 03:56.067
just as the victim
entered a 99-cent store.

03:56.153 --> 03:58.269
Well, uh, close.

03:58.364 --> 04:02.448
He was shot by a blunderbuss,
pelted by an angry mob
and then burned.

04:02.535 --> 04:05.618
Now, that’s what I call team spirit.

04:08.040 --> 04:11.703
I’m a...
wisecracking pathologist
with a dark sense of humor.

04:12.795 --> 04:15.787
It was funny. Yeah.

04:52.543 --> 04:54.534
What’d they say?

04:58.674 --> 05:00.630
Dishonorable discharge?

05:00.718 --> 05:03.881
Court-martial convicted me
of misuse ofauthority and
theft of government property.

05:03.971 --> 05:07.338
Come on. No Booth has ever
gotten a dishonorable discharge.

05:09.310 --> 05:12.928
Uh, yeah. No Booth
has ever had to save his brother
from an insane kidnapper.

05:14.690 --> 05:16.726
I’m sorry.

05:16.817 --> 05:19.809

out ofcrap my whole life.

[ Cell Phone Rings]

05:24.658 --> 05:27.240

refer to as a duty, right?

05:27.328 --> 05:29.239
Yes. Booth.

05:29.330 --> 05:31.366
Angela identified the boy
in the otter suit.

05:31.457 --> 05:33.914
- Oh, wow. That was quick.
Just give me a second.
- Are you talking to me?

05:34.001 --> 05:36.287
No, I’m talking
to my brother.
Just give me one minute.

05:36.378 --> 05:38.539
Just do your thing.
I’ll catch up with you later.

05:38.631 --> 05:41.668
- [ Sighs] Look. Hey,
I’ll help you find a job.
- What, me?

05:41.759 --> 05:44.250
| save your life, you find me a job?

05:44.345 --> 05:46.711
Yeah, that seems fair.

05:46.805 --> 05:49.091
Yeah, I’m back.

05:49.183 --> 05:52.346
The student walk-in dentist
was able to provide dental records.

05:52.436 --> 05:54.267
I e-mailed you
the particulars.

05:54.355 --> 05:58.519
The victim isJames Bouvier.
His friends called him Beaver,

05:58.651 --> 06:02.143
I assume because ofhis
last name, which is Bouvier.
Yeah, I’m sure that’s why.

06:02.238 --> 06:04.229
Although, despite the similar sound,

06:04.323 --> 06:06.905
Bouvier means “ox,”
not“beaven”

06:06.992 --> 06:11.656
Beaver is 23 years old and a member
ofthe Beta Delta Sigma fraternity.

06:11.747 --> 06:13.453
Yeah, that’s not a coincidence.

06:13.541 --> 06:15.953
Statistically, given
the size ofthe campus,

06:16.043 --> 06:19.160
it could be a complete coincidence
that the murdered student...

06:19.255 --> 06:22.713
is also a member ofthe group of
sociopathic, young male cadaver thieves.

06:22.800 --> 06:25.542
Statistically maybe.
But this is not math class, okay, Bones?

06:25.636 --> 06:28.298
Just meet me at Middlesex College
in 30 minutes.

06:28.389 --> 06:30.300

Don ’t ment/on anything
about Bea ver...

06:32.393 --> 06:34.258
when you’re talking
to these people.
Beaver. Okay.

06:34.395 --> 06:36.727
What people?
These people here.
They’re all potential suspects.

06:36.814 --> 06:38.805
Got it?
Okay.

06:38.899 --> 06:41.686
[ Booth]
Okay, so, who organized
the rally last night?

06:41.777 --> 06:44.189
That would be
me and Gary.

06:44.280 --> 06:46.612
That’s Greg Harmalard
and Gary Bacon.

06:46.699 --> 06:49.281
The bonﬁre is
kind of a tradition.

06:49.368 --> 06:51.950
Me and Gary added the whole
“hanging the enemy mascot” element.

06:52.037 --> 06:53.618
Molly brought in the band...

06:53.706 --> 06:56.288
and took care of
letting everyone know
the where and when details.

06:56.375 --> 06:58.286
Um— Well,just
an e-mail chain, really.

06:58.377 --> 07:01.369
- Well, whose idea
was the blunderbuss?
- Me again.

07:01.463 --> 07:04.421
You have to understand
that we had no Idea there was
a cadaver in there.

07:04.508 --> 07:07.295
- It’s from the med school, right?
That’s what I heard.
- [Booth] Okay

07:07.386 --> 07:09.798
Who stole the otter costume
from Forest Lake?

07:09.888 --> 07:12.425
Um, me, Greg and Dave.

07:12.516 --> 07:14.928
When you stole the costume,
was there anything inside of it?

07:15.019 --> 07:18.762
Nothing. I mean, there was
a dancing acrobat dude, whatever.

07:18.856 --> 07:21.313
But we duct-taped him
to a pole and took the suit.

07:21.400 --> 07:24.016
Where was the costume located
between the time you stole it...

07:24.111 --> 07:27.103
and it was hung on the gallows,
blown up and incinerated?

07:27.197 --> 07:30.439
Wejust kicked it
under here. This is
the homecoming float.

07:30.534 --> 07:35.153
Um, me, Dave and Greg stuffed it with
cafeteria leftovers and plastic bags.

07:35.247 --> 07:39.206
- The head was a cantaloupe.
- Uh, next day, we brought in
Dave’s dad’s truck...

07:39.293 --> 07:41.204
and hung it up,
drove it out to the rally.

07:41.295 --> 07:43.832
So are any ofyou guys members...

07:43.922 --> 07:47.255
ofthe Beta Delta Sigma
fraternity?

07:47.343 --> 07:49.709
Um, the Betas
don’t build school spirit.

07:49.803 --> 07:52.180
They tear it down.
So definitely not.

07:52.264 --> 07:54.471
Any of you guys know a guy
by the name ofJimmy Bouvier?

07:56.226 --> 07:59.389
Um, he’s a Beta.
He’s got a huge bong.

07:59.480 --> 08:01.186
[Greg]
Bea ver’s okay You know,
he’s a good-time guy.

08:01.273 --> 08:03.514
He l/kes to throw up a lot
is all / know

08:03.609 --> 08:07.943
But ifanybody was gonna put a cadaver
in an otter costume, it-it’d be Beaver.

08:08.030 --> 08:10.271
I’ll bet he was watching everyone
running and screaming last night...

08:10.366 --> 08:12.402
and laughing his ass off.

08:26.090 --> 08:29.582
This is a commemorative pin
from the Chinese Olympics.

08:29.677 --> 08:32.259
It was in what’s left
ofthe victim’s liver.

08:32.346 --> 08:34.837
Ball bearing. All this stuff
is extremely common.

08:34.932 --> 08:37.765
Nails, screws,
bolts, washers.

08:37.851 --> 08:39.637
Keys.
What is this?

08:42.398 --> 08:45.515
My guess—
it’s a USB drive.

08:45.609 --> 08:47.520
What kind of people
do this?

08:47.611 --> 08:51.274
Perforate human remains
with household commonalities
and refuse?

08:51.365 --> 08:53.856
Gee, I don’t know.
Every bomber who ever lived?

08:53.951 --> 08:56.658
Did you make that comment
simply because I am Muslim?

08:56.745 --> 08:59.361
You serious?
Of course.

08:59.456 --> 09:01.913
Timothy McVeigh,
Ted Kaczynski,

09:02.000 --> 09:03.706
William Ayers,

09:03.794 --> 09:07.628
Mr. George P. Metesky,
known as the original
Mad Bomber.

09:10.259 --> 09:13.217
It seems an insurmountable task, this.

09:13.303 --> 09:17.171
Each ofthese
could have been
the cause ofdeath,

09:17.266 --> 09:20.724
and yet, we would not
be able to trace its—

09:20.811 --> 09:23.803
Trace its—

09:23.897 --> 09:26.274
What?
Origin.

09:26.400 --> 09:29.267
This is a bullet.
A .22-caliber.

09:29.361 --> 09:31.818
A bullet says
“/ wish to kill you ”
much more clearly...

09:31.905 --> 09:33.861
than an Olympic pin.

09:33.991 --> 09:36.107
Can we agree?
Yeah.

09:40.414 --> 09:42.450
[Man]
I’m Robert Hooper, the
Beta Delta chapter president.

09:42.541 --> 09:45.453
This is Dalton Abbot.
He helped the Beaver steal
the corpse from the med school.

09:45.544 --> 09:48.877
Listen, we don’t care about the
cadaver. Wejust wanna find out
who killed your brother.

09:48.964 --> 09:53.082
We agreed before you got here
that we ’d answer any and all
quest/ons you have truthful/y.

09:53.177 --> 09:55.293
Ah. A conspiracy
to tell the truth.
Interesting.

09:55.387 --> 09:57.719
Yeah. Eli was
the Beaver’s frosh.

09:57.806 --> 09:59.967
You know, kind of breaking
him in to the Greek life.

10:00.058 --> 10:03.391
- Mmm. What was Beaver like?
- Beaver was the most popular
guy in the house.

10:03.479 --> 10:05.765
No, I asked,
“What was he like?”
Not, “Was he liked?”

10:05.898 --> 10:07.138
Sweets.
What?

10:07.232 --> 10:08.642
There’s a difference.
[Eli]
took

10:08.734 --> 10:12.318
The Beaver was exactly
like a great guy
who everybody liked.

10:12.404 --> 10:15.271
- [ Murmuring In Agreement]
- [Man] Yeah, he was cool.
He was a brother.

10:15.365 --> 10:17.230
What was Beaver’s life like
outside ofthe fraternity?

10:17.367 --> 10:20.450
Like Eli said, everybody liked him.
[Man] Yeah.

10:20.537 --> 10:24.371
Well, except for the faculty.
He was on academic probation.

10:24.458 --> 10:26.870
But academic probation
is the price you pay
for everybody liking you.

10:26.960 --> 10:30.578
Girlfriend? Or is this one ofthose
“bros before hos” kind of frats?

10:30.672 --> 10:32.458
[Laughter]
Beaver was more like a partier.

10:32.549 --> 10:35.086
Well, we do know that Beaver
was with at least one girl.

10:35.177 --> 10:37.759
- Why? What makes you think so?
- Scoreboard.

10:37.888 --> 10:40.425
What?
Beaver. One star,
one conquest.

10:40.516 --> 10:43.929
[Sweets]
Oh— So do the stars here...

10:44.019 --> 10:46.681
represent the number of times
individual members of the fraternity...

10:46.772 --> 10:49.354
completed the sex act,
or the number of girls?

10:49.441 --> 10:52.649
- The second.
-Just curious. Do you also
compare penis sizes?

10:52.736 --> 10:55.318
No! Only ifwe’re really drunk
and already naked.

10:55.405 --> 10:57.532
- What?
- What? I—
- [Man] You’re crazy, man.

10:57.616 --> 11:00.107
We agreed to answer
all their questions truthfully.

11:00.202 --> 11:04.866
Dalton Abbot.
Very successful according to this.
Compensating for something.

11:04.957 --> 11:08.996
Sweets, stop psychoanalyzin g
frat life and just get on
with the Beaver questions.

11:09.086 --> 11:11.668
Sure. Of course.
But, guys, wouldn’t it
be more impressive...

11:11.755 --> 11:14.872
to actually have a single girl
want to have sex with you
multiple times,

11:14.967 --> 11:18.755
unless your only objective
it to Impress other
adolescent males?

11:18.846 --> 11:21.178
- Guys, Beaver’s single star.
- Molly Briggs.

11:21.265 --> 11:24.507
- Thank you.
- Guys, we agreed, for the last time.

11:24.601 --> 11:28.344
IfHarmalard found out
that Beaver was bouncin’ Molly,
he’d kill him.

11:28.438 --> 11:31.805
Greg Harmalard?
The-The guy who
organized the bonfire?

11:31.900 --> 11:35.188
Yeah. Yeah, Molly’s boyfriend.
He’s in R.O.T.C.

11:35.279 --> 11:39.397
- They like shooting things.
- Yeah.

11:39.491 --> 11:44.235
They keep track
of sexual conquests
with stars on the wall?

11:44.371 --> 11:47.158
It’s emotionally stunted.
Guys, it’s a college
fraternity.

11:47.249 --> 11:49.365
They seem like
really terrible people.

11:49.459 --> 11:53.327
They’re college kids, okay?
It’s— Theirjob description
is to be bad. It’s what they do.

11:53.422 --> 11:57.006
Yeah, but still, a community
ofyoung men mutually
supporting bad decisions.

11:57.092 --> 11:59.674
Look, these kids,
they go out into the world.
They’re alone.

11:59.761 --> 12:03.470
They have no supervision.
They have to be bad in order
to figure out what it is.

12:03.557 --> 12:06.094
Did you kno w— S dent/tic fact.
Their frontal lobes
are the size of rais/ns.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.763
No, that is not
a scientific fact.
What they gotta do...

12:08.854 --> 12:11.186
is build their frontal lobes
with exercise, okay?

12:11.273 --> 12:13.434
- And that comes from
doing the wrong thing.
-OMy

12:13.525 --> 12:16.892
- So your theory is,
you gotta be bad to be good?
- Exactly. Facts of life.

12:16.987 --> 12:19.069
So what transmissions
did you get from the brothers?

12:19.197 --> 12:22.815
Booth, he is not a radio.
Well, he kind of is. That’s why
I brought him along, Bones.

12:22.910 --> 12:25.947
What I did observe,
using my eyes and my training,

12:26.038 --> 12:28.996
is that these three
frat brothers weren’t actually
upset about Beaver’s death.

12:29.082 --> 12:32.620
- How do you know?
- Well, real grief
comes and goes in waves.

12:32.711 --> 12:35.544
These guys had their faces
set in sadness the whole time.

12:35.672 --> 12:38.505
They were lying.
I believe you’re
just guessing.

12:44.556 --> 12:46.933
Okay. Fine.
I’m a magic eight ball.

12:47.017 --> 12:48.973
Ithink you hurt
his feelings.

12:49.061 --> 12:51.222
Did you believe him?

12:51.313 --> 12:54.601
The bullet Arastoo found
in the victim ’5 remains
was a .ZZ-cal/ber.

12:54.691 --> 12:57.649
-Light and relatively undamaged.
-Low-pressure rimfire cartridge.

12:57.736 --> 13:00.569
Which is consistent with
R.O.T.C. small arms.

13:08.372 --> 13:10.909
So, do you recognize
this pistol?

13:10.999 --> 13:16.665
Yes, sir.
It’s a Beretta U-22 Neos L.R.
with a six-inch barrel.

13:16.755 --> 13:19.792
Ten-round capacity.
Low blade front sights
and adjustable rear sights.

13:19.883 --> 13:21.794
I’m in R.O.T.C.
I know my weapons.

13:21.885 --> 13:24.046
Well, you should know this one
particularly well because...

13:24.137 --> 13:26.924
it was last signed out to you.

13:27.015 --> 13:31.429
F.B.I. ballistics has ascertained
that this gun fired this bullet.

13:31.561 --> 13:34.143
Where’d you find
the bullet?
In Beaver’s corpse.

13:34.231 --> 13:36.563
- Beaver’s dead?
- He’s catching on pretty good.

13:36.650 --> 13:40.643
- Wait. I never shot Beaver.
- Did you fire this gun at the rally?

13:40.737 --> 13:44.195
Yes, sir, I did.
But I loaded it with blanks.

13:44.282 --> 13:46.534
That was Beaver hanging
in the otter mascot outfit?

13:46.618 --> 13:49.485
- He’s quite adept at putting
the puzzle together.
- Mm-hmm.

13:49.579 --> 13:53.163
- What was Beaver doing in there?
- We were hoping that maybe
you could be able to tell us.

13:53.250 --> 13:55.491
Look, I told you,
I loaded the gun with blanks.

13:55.585 --> 13:58.748
- Did you check the chamber?
- I think so.

13:58.839 --> 14:02.172
Well, obviously,
you are either careless,

14:02.259 --> 14:04.591
or you intended to fire the bullet.

14:04.678 --> 14:06.589
Or somebody, you know,
sabotaged me.

14:06.680 --> 14:09.672
Beaver had to be hanging up there
for at least an hour before—

14:09.766 --> 14:13.304
No way that Beaver was still alive
when I fired. Right?

14:15.814 --> 14:18.556
I had no idea it was Beaver.
I had no reason to shoot Beaver.

14:18.650 --> 14:21.312
Except for the fact that
he slept with your girlfriend.

14:21.403 --> 14:23.394
Uh, I don’t—
I don’t wanna sound conceited,

14:23.488 --> 14:28.949
but... look at Beaver,
look at Molly, look at me.

14:31.621 --> 14:33.953
Me and Beaver sexually?

14:34.041 --> 14:36.032
Do I look like
a blow-up doll?

14:36.126 --> 14:38.913
Beaver told his
fraternal brothers that
he had sex with you.

14:39.004 --> 14:40.585
Yeah, well, he lied.

14:40.672 --> 14:44.005
took, / 7/ give you DNA.
or whate ver you want.

14:44.092 --> 14:47.630
And then you can do me a favor
and broadcast the results
across the campus.

14:52.267 --> 14:55.851
- I have an idea.
- We’re gonna collect his sheets
off his bed?

14:55.937 --> 14:58.679
Yes. And then we will
check them for DNA,

14:58.774 --> 15:01.641
see if he had sexual intercourse
with Molly Briggs.

15:01.735 --> 15:05.102
Right. Who’s gonna check
the kid’s sheets?

15:05.197 --> 15:07.279
Seems like a badjob
to me.

15:07.365 --> 15:10.198
Mm-hmm.

15:14.790 --> 15:17.577
Gentlemen,
raise your glasses.
[Door Opens]

15:20.253 --> 15:24.713
I ask that you form in your mind
your favorite image
ofourfallen brother,

15:24.800 --> 15:26.916
/imm y “the Bea ver” Bouvier.l

15:27.052 --> 15:29.384
[ Cheering, Whooping]
Why are they all
wearing bedsheets?

15:29.513 --> 15:33.927
It’s a toga memorial.
And with that image
firm in your mind, I say drink!

15:34.017 --> 15:37.259
- [ Cheering, Shouting]
- Yeah! Beaver!

15:37.354 --> 15:41.222
Excuse me.
Did one ofyou take the sheets
from Beaver’s room?

15:41.316 --> 15:43.978
’Cause that room
is sealed for evidence,
and you will be prosecuted.

15:44.069 --> 15:47.027
That’s a good one, Bones.
Now no one’s gonna admit
to having Beaver’s sheets.

15:47.155 --> 15:50.818
Then we’ll have
to take them all.
You can take mine, pretty lady.

15:50.909 --> 15:52.695
Hey, yeah, yeah.
You heard ’em, boys.

15:52.786 --> 15:55.072
- Give ’em your sheets.
- [Man #7]
You can do my laund/y.

15:55.163 --> 15:57.495
[Man #2] Free Willy.
[Man #3 ]
Little ﬂuff and fold.

15:57.582 --> 15:59.288
[Chattering Continues]

15:59.376 --> 16:02.493
- I’ll meet you back at the lab, okay?
- Hangin’in the wind

16:02.629 --> 16:04.790
Can I— Can I offer you
anything, ma’am?
[Man] It’s cold

16:04.881 --> 16:09.045
Gettin ’sma/l.
No. Mm-mmm.

16:20.313 --> 16:23.146
Huh? What do you think?

16:23.233 --> 16:26.066
It’s nice. Not really gonna
do you much good here
in the wintertime.

16:26.194 --> 16:28.435
That’s for sure.
You’re always practical,
huh, Seeley?

16:28.572 --> 16:30.984
Listen, I got you
a job interview.
Yeah?

16:31.116 --> 16:34.779
Yeah. An army buddy ofmine up in Pittsburgh
is looking for someone to head up
his criminal intelligence unit.

16:34.870 --> 16:38.362
- You found me a job
in less than 24 hours?
-Just an interview.

16:38.498 --> 16:40.238
Do you wanna use
my car?
No.

16:40.333 --> 16:43.746
Jared, you can’t show up
to a job interview on a bike.

16:43.837 --> 16:46.123
- Seeley, I’m not going
to the interview.
- Why?

16:46.214 --> 16:49.206
Because I don’t want a job.
I’m gonna take this thing,
and I’m goin’ on a trip.

16:49.301 --> 16:52.338
- You’re goin’ on a trip? Where?
- I’ve always wanted to see India...

16:52.429 --> 16:54.420
without, you know,
spying on Pakistan.

16:54.514 --> 16:59.008
Oh, okay. I see. So you’re gonna somehow
get this bike to India, ride it around.

16:59.102 --> 17:01.969
What ifit breaks down?
What are you gonna do
for parts?

17:02.063 --> 17:04.270
What am I gonna do for parts
ifit breaks down in India?

17:04.399 --> 17:06.856
That’s all you have to say?
You know what?
Just go on the interview.

17:06.943 --> 17:08.774
Would you—

17:11.698 --> 17:14.440
You forgot to tell me to get shots
and not to talk to strangers.

17:25.170 --> 17:28.537
[Device Beeps]
So, were you able to
match sheets with boys?

17:28.632 --> 17:30.873
Believe me,
there was enough DNA.
on these sheets...

17:30.967 --> 17:33.709
to paint a very clear picture
of life at Beta Delta Sigma.

17:33.803 --> 17:37.591
For example, these two boys
were carrying on a sexual
relationship with each other.

17:37.682 --> 17:39.798
[Hodgins]
Nah. Those two guys are
sleeping with the same girl.

17:39.893 --> 17:41.758
Although, refreshingly,
not at the same time.

17:41.895 --> 17:45.103
What about Beaver?
Oh. Lots and lots
of DNA.

17:45.190 --> 17:47.522
- All of it his own.
- So there’s no DNA...

17:47.609 --> 17:49.645
on any ofthe sheets
that could be Molly Briggs’s?

17:49.736 --> 17:53.570
Vaginal contributions were found
on eight ofthe sets ofsheets.
None from Molly Briggs.

17:53.657 --> 17:57.241
But Dr. Hodgins did find
something more than semen
on Beaver’s sheets.

17:57.327 --> 17:59.693
Yeah, I found evidence
ofvegetable—based lanol,

17:59.788 --> 18:02.655
assorted liposomes,
Seba-Gel,
and micronized estriol.

18:02.749 --> 18:06.241
- Ointment.
- From the stain’s position
on the sheet and its shape,

18:06.336 --> 18:09.794
which was approximately
three inches long by
one and one-quarter inch wide—

18:09.881 --> 18:12.748
- Okay. We get it.
- The substance appears
to have transferred...

18:12.842 --> 18:15.800
from the victim’s penis
directly to the bedsheet.

18:15.887 --> 18:19.550
Adolescent males will use
almost any available lubricant
when masturbating.

18:19.641 --> 18:22.474
- Even estrogen cream?
- A more plausible scenario...

18:22.560 --> 18:24.516
has got Beaver
sexing it up
at a different location,

18:24.604 --> 18:27.471
then coming home
to his own bed naked.

18:27.565 --> 18:29.817
And I refer again
to the imprint.

18:29.901 --> 18:31.892
- Sex with—
- An older woman.

18:31.987 --> 18:34.148
Yeah. Yeah,
most likely, menopausal.

18:34.239 --> 18:37.606
- Molly Briggs is 20.
- Also, I finished my autopsy.

18:37.701 --> 18:40.534
And the bullet shot
by Greg Harmalard
was definitely not cause ofdeath.

18:40.620 --> 18:43.862
- He was dead when it struck him?
- For at least 12 hours.

18:43.957 --> 18:47.040
So we still have
no cause ofdeath?
Well, / got a theory.

18:47.127 --> 18:51.541
Kid died ofdehydration.
Forgot to replenish his fluids.

18:58.138 --> 19:00.049
Okay, what are we
looking for this time?

19:00.140 --> 19:02.631
You know, photos,
love notes, uh,

19:02.726 --> 19:05.217
I don’t know, fur,
gray hair.

19:05.312 --> 19:07.849
Anything that’s gonna help us
identify Beaver’s cougar.

19:07.939 --> 19:12.399
Beaver, otter, cougar.
This case is like
a day at the zoo.

19:12.485 --> 19:14.646
A cougar is an older woman
who prefers younger men.

19:14.738 --> 19:17.571
Wouldn’t that indicate that
every woman is a cougar?

19:17.657 --> 19:20.194
Thanks for the insight
there, Bones. Okay.

19:20.285 --> 19:23.777
What’s the, uh,
victim ’s birth date?
1 1-05-89.

19:23.872 --> 19:25.863
I’m Jared’s older brother.
He should listen to me.

19:25.957 --> 19:29.415
I could provide you
with several societies where
younger brothers are required...

19:29.502 --> 19:32.494
under threat of death to do
what their older brothers
tell them.

19:32.589 --> 19:35.456
- I like those societies.
- Well, they’re mostly extinct now.

19:37.177 --> 19:41.011
Did you give me Beaver’s
birthday the scientific way?
Day, month, year

19:41.097 --> 19:44.760
Ifyou want month, day, year,
05-11-89.

19:44.851 --> 19:46.887
Aha! Look at that.

19:46.978 --> 19:50.436
Next time I ask you a question,
just answer it in American.
That’s all.

19:50.523 --> 19:53.265
Oh. The kid had some cash.

19:53.401 --> 19:55.608
Maybe he was
a drug dealer.
Hmm.

19:55.695 --> 19:58.482
Ooh. What are those?
Some kind of codebooks?

19:58.573 --> 20:02.191
- You got that right.
- Was our victim some kind ofspy?

20:02.285 --> 20:04.776
It’s worse.
He was some kind
of bookie.

20:11.294 --> 20:13.876
Well, Booth mostly
broke the code.
That’s right.

20:13.963 --> 20:16.249
Column one is
initials and nicknames.

20:16.341 --> 20:18.957
Beaver had approximately
50 regular clients.

20:19.052 --> 20:20.963
Column two is
the day ofthe week.

20:21.054 --> 20:23.420
[Brennan]
What is the significance
ofthis sequence?

20:23.515 --> 20:25.801
“Foot. Bat. Pig.
Dimple. Fish.”

20:25.892 --> 20:29.885
Those are the sports he took
bets on. Football, basketball,
baseball, soccer, golf.

20:29.979 --> 20:32.846
Bea ver had 0 ver $2, 000
in his suitcase.

20:32.941 --> 20:36.229
This whole operation generated
$1 2,000 this year.

20:36.319 --> 20:39.561
Wow. No wonder this kid
did not wanna lose
academic standing.

20:39.656 --> 20:41.362
All right. Now,
three ofthese people—

20:41.449 --> 20:44.532
Zimmen C. C and 4X4—

20:44.619 --> 20:46.701
they all owed him
over three grand a piece.

20:46.788 --> 20:50.781
- You think that could be motive?
- I bet those are the three guys
Sweets said were faking grief.

20:50.875 --> 20:53.252
Yeah. That is worth
looking into.

20:53.336 --> 20:55.497
Okay. I found something else
in his computer.

20:55.588 --> 20:58.921
A month ago, he hacked into
the university’s computer system...

20:59.008 --> 21:01.260
and went straight to
the chemistry professor’s
secure server...

21:01.344 --> 21:03.209
and downloaded the exam.

21:03.304 --> 21:05.215
[Chuckles]
This guy was
a true entrepreneur.

21:05.306 --> 21:08.139
Yeah. It was the third time
he hacked into the chemistry page.

21:08.226 --> 21:10.512
Who was the professor?

21:10.603 --> 21:13.561
[A nge/a ]
Uh, Professor Marlene Twardosh.

21:13.648 --> 21:16.014
Well—

21:18.027 --> 21:23.272
Out ofall the damages
the victim’s remains suffered
from the blunderbuss— 23 fractures—

21:23.366 --> 21:26.483
I discovered only three
that occurred before he died.

21:26.578 --> 21:28.694
Do any ofthem offer us
cause ofdeath?

21:28.788 --> 21:32.576
I think not.
Both wrists sustained
compression fractures.

21:32.667 --> 21:34.953
The right radius,
the left ulna,

21:35.044 --> 21:39.538
and significant chipping
to both the proximal
and distal carpal rows...

21:39.632 --> 21:41.543
and compression of
the lateral epicondyles.

21:41.634 --> 21:44.592
Ouch.
What about the third?

21:44.679 --> 21:48.388
Compression fracture here
at the coccyx and
the apex ofthe sacrum.

21:48.475 --> 21:51.308
These injuries appear
to have occurred
at the same time.

21:51.394 --> 21:55.478
He fell backwards,
tried to break his fall with
his hands stretched behind him.

21:55.565 --> 21:59.683
Dr. Hodgins had an idea
of how to figure out the height
from which the victim fell.

21:59.777 --> 22:02.905
Oh.
This should be good.

22:04.908 --> 22:09.277
The FBI. is in vest/gating
student cheating?

22:09.370 --> 22:11.986
Who says America
undervalues education?

22:12.081 --> 22:15.699
Did any ofyour students
do suspiciously well
on your last exam?

22:15.793 --> 22:17.704
Starting with
James Bouvier.

22:17.795 --> 22:21.287
Beaver has never done
suspiciously well
at anything, Agent Booth.

22:21.382 --> 22:24.670
He was about to be expelled
because he failed my course.

22:24.761 --> 22:27.594
Did he show any signs that
he wanted to do any better?

22:27.680 --> 22:32.674
You mean begging for mercy
or offering bribes and sexual favors?
That sort ofthing?

22:32.769 --> 22:35.385
- Do you use an estrogen cream?
- [ Groans]
- No.

22:35.480 --> 22:38.563
I make do
with the meager hormones
I produce naturally.

22:38.691 --> 22:41.478
Why?
Did you have sexual
intercourse with Beaver?

22:41.569 --> 22:46.063
- What are you—
- [Chuckles] I wasjoking
about the sexual favors.

22:46.157 --> 22:49.069
Also about the bribes?

22:50.161 --> 22:52.277
My God,
you people are humorless.

22:54.207 --> 22:56.414
Five students failed
this exam.

22:56.501 --> 23:01.916
- It was a tough exam.
- They got exactly
the same score— 37%.

23:02.048 --> 23:05.336
What are the chances
ofthat?
I teach chemistry.

23:05.426 --> 23:07.678
You’ll have to ask
Professor DeWitt in Statistics.

23:07.762 --> 23:12.802
But the same five students
did extremely well on the
two tests preceding this one.

23:12.892 --> 23:15.850
-Bones, what are you gettin’ at?
-I believe Professor Twardosh...

23:15.937 --> 23:19.225
realized that these students
had stolen her tests in the past.

23:19.315 --> 23:24.184
And instead of informing
the university, she planted
a lake test on/ine.

23:24.279 --> 23:27.066
- To turn her students in?
- No.

23:27.156 --> 23:33.072
That would result in hearings
and excuses and tears
and parents. I hate parents.

23:33.162 --> 23:36.495
Look, your college experience
was with professors.
Mine was with students and jocks.

23:36.624 --> 23:40.208
What are you gettin ’ at here?
Well, I believe Professor Twardosh
took revenge...

23:40.295 --> 23:43.753
against unethical students
who had no respect
for kno w/edge.

23:43.840 --> 23:45.831
- And you approve?
- Yes, I do.

23:45.925 --> 23:48.166
Beaver was obviously
an emerging criminal.

23:48.261 --> 23:50.502
Thank you.
I may need you...

23:50.597 --> 23:54.966
to testify
at my termination hearing
when the university finds out.

23:55.059 --> 23:59.177
- Can I ask you one question?
What floor is your office on?
- The third ﬂoor.

23:59.272 --> 24:02.105
- Over grass?
- Over flagstones.

24:02.191 --> 24:04.603
On my bad days,
I considerjumping.

24:04.694 --> 24:07.902
You’re a forensic
anthropologist, correct?

24:07.989 --> 24:10.605
- Would it kill me?
- No, Professor Twardosh.

24:10.700 --> 24:13.442
It would probablyjust
break a few bones.

24:13.536 --> 24:15.743
- That’s good to know.
-Mmm

24:18.625 --> 24:21.913
So I checked out
the nicknames ofthe kids
who owed Beaver money.

24:22.003 --> 24:24.460
Are those the guys
you picked out as
not being sad he was dead?

24:24.547 --> 24:26.458
Uh, yeah.
You’re walking pretty fast.

24:26.549 --> 24:30.007
Uh— So any ofthose
three frat guys set off
your psycho-killer alarm?

24:30.094 --> 24:33.336
No, no, no.
They display a fairly banal mix
of social awkwardness,

24:33.431 --> 24:35.922
narcissism,
inappropriate fantasies.

24:36.059 --> 24:39.722
All within the normal range.
Even the R.O.T.C. guy?

24:39.812 --> 24:45.603
Well, like most overachievers,
he displays a slight
Oedipal neurosis.

24:45.693 --> 24:47.979
- Will you share with me
why you’re so agitated?
- You know what?

24:48.071 --> 24:50.528
My brotherJared
is ruining his life.

24:50.615 --> 24:52.230
Oh. He’s drinking again?

24:52.325 --> 24:54.566
No. I’m pretty sure
he was dried out
before his court-martial.

24:54.661 --> 24:56.652
Then why the recent urge
to self-destruct?

24:56.746 --> 24:59.658
I set up a perfectly
greatjob interview
for him.

24:59.749 --> 25:01.660
But instead, you know
what he decides to do?

25:01.751 --> 25:05.084
He wants tojust
travel across India
on his motorcycle.

25:05.171 --> 25:09.164
Yeah, that’s right.
Talk about a narcissistic
dependence on stupidity.

25:09.258 --> 25:10.839
Mm-hmm. You or him?

25:10.927 --> 25:13.794
This is exactly why
I don’t talk to you
about these kind ofthings.

25:13.888 --> 25:16.675
Okay. I’m gonna suggest
that you’rejealous of
your brother’s decision.

25:16.766 --> 25:21.135
- I don’t want to go to India.
- Well, you feel trapped here
by your responsible nature.

25:21.229 --> 25:23.470
Yourjob, your
interpersonal relations.
What?

25:23.564 --> 25:25.600
WhereasJared
is completely free.

25:25.692 --> 25:28.149
[Laughing]
lam free.
I am free as a bird.

25:28.236 --> 25:30.147
Free to do whatever I want.

25:30.238 --> 25:32.354
Yeah, but what you’re not free to do
is control your brother’s life.

25:32.448 --> 25:34.530
ControlJared.
Good luck with that one.

25:34.617 --> 25:36.528
Well, it’s not for
a lack oftrying.

25:36.619 --> 25:38.530
You could always
get a motorbike
and go with him.

25:38.621 --> 25:43.331
A “motorbike.”
A motorbike is used for people
who deliver pizzas in Amsterdam.

25:43.418 --> 25:46.251
You know,
India is large.

25:46.337 --> 25:49.625
/t’s vast
Get a motorcycle.

25:51.634 --> 25:53.875
Right.

25:53.970 --> 25:56.461
I’d get
an American motorcycle.

26:03.312 --> 26:05.724
[Hodgins ] This dummy is exactly
the same weight as the victim, correct?

26:05.815 --> 26:09.057
69.853 kilograms,
yes.

26:09.152 --> 26:11.609
And why are we
the only ones here?

26:11.696 --> 26:14.904
Oh, I, uh,
asked everyone to leave.

26:14.991 --> 26:18.358
Okay, now, I have installed
four sensors in the wrists
and in the back ofthe spine.

26:18.453 --> 26:20.865
So we should be able
to gauge the height
from which the victim fell...

26:20.955 --> 26:23.913
to within a few centimeters
after only a few trials.

26:24.000 --> 26:27.208
Why did you ask
everyone to leave?
Are we doing something shameful?

26:27.295 --> 26:30.583
No, it’sjust—
Last time I dropped
something from up there,

26:30.673 --> 26:34.086
it bounced and injured An—
innocent bystander.

26:34.177 --> 26:36.384
But nobody’s here
this t/me.

26:36.471 --> 26:38.132
So—

26:38.264 --> 26:41.427
Coccyx test number one.
Dr.Jack Hodgins supervising.
[Saroyan ] No.

26:41.559 --> 26:43.299
No, no, no.
Uh— No.
But—

26:43.394 --> 26:44.349
No, no.
It—

26:44.437 --> 26:47.725
Stop. This is
an unnecessary experiment.

26:47.815 --> 26:50.227
The height ofthe fall
can be calculated
mathematically.

26:50.318 --> 26:53.435
Th-That is true.
But I decided to humor
Dr. Hodgins...

26:53.529 --> 26:55.440
so we could bond
over a project.

26:55.531 --> 26:58.898
- Why do you need to bond?
- He mistrusts Muslims.

27:01.871 --> 27:05.910
Go grab a beer together.
But I am saying no
to this experiment.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.787
Yeah. I got that during
the part where you said “no”
seven times in a row.

27:08.878 --> 27:11.210
I find that you don’t pay
attention to the first six.

27:11.297 --> 27:13.583
He can’t drink beer.
He’s Muslim!

27:16.052 --> 27:17.633
[Typing]
All right.

27:17.720 --> 27:20.462
Hodgins and Arastoo
have an estimate of
how far the victim fell.

27:20.556 --> 27:24.265
1.37 meters
onto a hard surface.

27:26.479 --> 27:28.686
You know what
this means, don’t you?
Yep.

27:28.773 --> 27:30.980
Dr. Brennan’s gonna
stare at the bones
until they speak to her.

27:31.067 --> 27:33.649
So “rock, paper, scissors”
to see who stays
to babysit her?

Okay.
Okay.

Booth will want to know.
I found cause ofdeath.

28:41.345 --> 28:43.006
All right.

28:46.601 --> 28:48.683
JJ/Ends}

28:51.314 --> 28:55.683
Professor Twardosh
was not Beaver’s sex partner.
Okay. Did anyone think that?

28:55.776 --> 28:59.564
- Honestly? Because I did not.
- Booth believes that the
cringe factor was too high,

28:59.655 --> 29:02.271
even though cringe factor
is not a valid
mathematical construct.

29:02.366 --> 29:04.527
Believe me, it is.
Okay?

29:04.619 --> 29:07.952
So the three boys
that owe Beaver the money
all have alibis.

29:08.039 --> 29:12.578
Four people bought
the bogus exam from Beaver,
all members of the golfteam.

29:12.668 --> 29:15.705
At the time of his death though,
they were at a tournament
in North Carolina.

29:15.796 --> 29:19.539
Great. So all we know now
is that, uh, golfers cheat a lot.

29:19.634 --> 29:22.842
We know that
Beaver was killed by
being stabbed in the chest.

29:22.929 --> 29:25.796
A very small hole.
Perhaps an ice pick.
Punctured his aorta.

29:25.932 --> 29:29.265
He bled to death internal/y.
We also know that
shortly before he died,

29:29.352 --> 29:33.846
he fell backward 1.37 meters,
fracturing his wrists
and his coccyx.

29:33.940 --> 29:36.397
Okay. So he was stabbed,
and he fell backwards.
That makes sense.

29:36.484 --> 29:40.068
Something’s bothering me about this.
I went through that kid’s computer,

29:40.154 --> 29:42.270
and there’s absolutely no indication
that he had the skill...

29:42.365 --> 29:44.777
to hack into the
university’s secure server.

29:44.867 --> 29:47.529
Yeah, well, he probably
got his fraternity brothers
to hack in for him.

29:47.620 --> 29:51.204
Well, Mr. Vaziri and I
will figure out exactly
what weapon killed Beaver.

29:51.332 --> 29:53.288
Great.
Well, what are you
going to do?

29:53.376 --> 29:54.957
- Uh, something personal.
- What?

29:55.044 --> 29:59.708
Personal.
Personal means personal,
you know? Not forthe public.

29:59.799 --> 30:03.712
Well, I’m—
I’m not the public.

30:07.974 --> 30:10.135
You know the roads
suck in India
when they’re dry, right?

30:10.226 --> 30:12.717
And-And they turn into rivers
when the monsoons come.

30:12.812 --> 30:14.848
I’ll tell you what.
Trucks don’t even
give way to anyone.

30:14.939 --> 30:17.351
Will you give
the lifeguard thing a rest,
Seeley? All right?

30:17.441 --> 30:19.853
The State Department has advised
that there is a heightened
security concern...

30:19.944 --> 30:21.935
for anyone
traveling alone in India.

30:22.029 --> 30:25.192
Then come with me. I mean,
that way, you can watch
over me every minute.

30:25.282 --> 30:28.069
You know, everwvhere
you’ve gone, you’ve always
had the full might...

30:28.160 --> 30:30.071
of the United States government
behind you.

30:30.162 --> 30:33.325
Yeah, I know. I know.
You were a frontline guy,
a fire-eater,

30:33.457 --> 30:35.789
and | wasjust some
rear echelon wimp.
I never said that.

30:35.876 --> 30:37.912
You’re so worried,
come along.

30:38.004 --> 30:41.041
Then, I’ll have
the full might of
Seeley Booth behind me.

30:41.132 --> 30:43.589
Seriously?

30:43.676 --> 30:46.588
I didn’t think you were serious.

30:47.638 --> 30:51.347
I wasn’t when I said it.
But now I am.

30:51.475 --> 30:55.434
Yeah. I’m serious.
You want me to come
to India with you?

30:57.440 --> 30:59.806
Ball’s in your court,
brother.

31:11.120 --> 31:15.409
I’m a freshman pledge.
Beaver was kind oflike
my mentor in the fraternity.

31:15.499 --> 31:18.161
When Beaver,
uh, your mentor,

31:18.252 --> 31:21.289
asked you to hack into
Professor Twardosh’s files...

31:21.380 --> 31:23.757
to steal tests,
what did you think?

31:25.259 --> 31:29.844
At first, I said no.
But you know what?

31:29.972 --> 31:32.008
Beaver was your brother.
That’s r/ght.

31:32.099 --> 31:34.590
He was a brother who was on
academic probation.

31:34.685 --> 31:37.518
I mean, he was
gonna get expelled if he
didn’t pass the chem course.

31:37.605 --> 31:40.438
Plus, /know it may not
have looked like it
from the outside,

31:40.524 --> 31:42.776
but Beaver was a great guy.

31:42.860 --> 31:44.816
So I had to help him.

31:46.489 --> 31:50.277
Our computer expert said that some info
was erased from Beaver’s hard drive.

31:50.367 --> 31:52.744
Erased by someone who knew
what they were doing.

31:52.828 --> 31:56.571
That was me too.JPEG files.
I think about 30 ofthem.

31:56.707 --> 31:58.163
Digital photographs?
Yeah.

31:58.250 --> 32:01.242
I-I didn’t see any ofthem.
But before I permanently deleted them,

32:01.337 --> 32:04.795
Beaver had asked me to put
four specific ones onto a USB drive.

32:04.882 --> 32:06.998
So /did.

32:07.093 --> 32:09.584
Look.

32:09.678 --> 32:11.714
/ told you eve/yth/ng,
okay?

32:11.806 --> 32:14.343
But if my college finds out that
I hacked into the chem test,

32:14.433 --> 32:16.014
they’re gonna kick me
to the curb.

32:16.102 --> 32:18.263
Okay? They don ’t care
about brothers.

32:18.354 --> 32:20.766
Well, I care about brothers
who are great guys, Eli.

32:20.856 --> 32:23.188
But, more importantly,
/report to the FB./.,

32:23.275 --> 32:26.312
not Middlesex College.

32:26.403 --> 32:28.894
Thanks.

32:31.200 --> 32:32.940
[Booth]
Hey, what do you got?

32:33.035 --> 32:34.900
We found the hacker,
who told Sweets...

32:34.995 --> 32:38.203
he put some
very sensitive images
on a USB for Beaver.

32:38.290 --> 32:40.952
A damaged USB drive
was amongst the shrapnel...

32:41.043 --> 32:43.159
that Mr. Vaziri removed
from the remains.

32:43.254 --> 32:47.372
There are fourJPEG files on this drive,
and two of them are total goners.

32:47.466 --> 32:50.299
But here’s what I got
from number three.

32:50.386 --> 32:52.843
[Booth]
Concentrate.
That looks like a face.

32:52.930 --> 32:54.511
[Angela ]
Yep, that’s Beaver.

32:54.598 --> 32:56.759
- Is he being tortured?
- Not exactly.

32:56.851 --> 33:00.844
Yeah, that’s a sex face, Bones.
Can you pull up anything else
and see who he’s with?

33:00.938 --> 33:02.474
No.

33:02.565 --> 33:05.307
But this one ’s almost done.

33:05.401 --> 33:08.313
[Booth] Whoa.
[Brennan]
/5 that a cougar?

33:08.404 --> 33:10.440
- She could be in her 405.
- Okay, print it.

33:10.531 --> 33:14.570
- We’ll see which member of
the faculty this one is.
- [Typing ]

33:18.914 --> 33:22.498
There is no
accelerated compression of
the bone around the wound.

33:22.585 --> 33:26.419
So the shaft ofthe weapon
was uniform in thickness.

33:26.505 --> 33:28.416
Ifthere were no lip
on the outside,

33:28.507 --> 33:30.714
then we’d know
it was a projectile
that caused the wound.

33:30.801 --> 33:32.712
Yes.
A one-way trip,
so to speak.

33:32.803 --> 33:36.716
But since there was a lip,
we know it was a return trip
for the weapon—

33:36.807 --> 33:38.468
into the aorta
and back.

33:38.559 --> 33:40.220
As the weapon
entered,

33:40.311 --> 33:44.145
it was going
substantially faster
than when it was withdrawn.

33:45.399 --> 33:48.141
A shaft
of consistent width.

33:48.235 --> 33:51.102
Someone hammered a nail
into the victim,

- Have you seen
the photographs before?
- Yes, just overa week ago,

34:33.864 --> 34:35.900
which is when I suggested
to Meredith that...

34:35.991 --> 34:38.152
it was a good time for her
to visit her sister
in Toronto.

34:38.244 --> 34:39.984
Mm—hmm.
Why was it
a good time?

to put the photos
