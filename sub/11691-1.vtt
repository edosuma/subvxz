01:14.910 --> 01:19.142
(reporter) The much-criticized Cincinnati
Accord has brought a cease-fire to Bosnia,

01:19.248 --> 01:23.947
and it appears to be holding, prompting
NATO forces to begin a withdrawal,

01:24.053 --> 01:26.851
which should be complete by New Year's Day,

01:26.956 --> 01:29.982
close to the US president's
''Home by the holidays '' pledge.

01:30.092 --> 01:31.923
Yet even as the conflict winds down,

01:32.027 --> 01:37.795
the US military remains in a high state
of readiness, eager to answer the call.

01:37.900 --> 01:42.735
(radio) Golden Eagle, this is Hawkeye. l've got
unknown rider not responding to coms.

01:42.838 --> 01:44.669
Suspect hostile intent.

01:44.774 --> 01:48.938
Unclassified bandit.
Launch the alert. Launch the alert.

01:57.319 --> 02:02.052
Sailors, let's move it out there. We need
to get this aircraft airborne in five minutes.

02:16.705 --> 02:18.798
- Nose wheel.
- Check.

02:18.908 --> 02:20.239
- Gun-blast diffuser.
- Clear.

02:20.342 --> 02:22.572
- Right intake. Left intake.
- Check. Check.

02:22.678 --> 02:25.238
- Ejection seat is safe. Arm handle.
- Copy. l show safe.

02:25.347 --> 02:27.747
- Com lFF.
- Up and up. Let's go. Move it.

02:27.850 --> 02:30.478
- DDl, MPCD and ETD.
- Go flight.

02:30.586 --> 02:33.714
- FCS, ECS, AWP.
- lt's all green across the board.

02:33.823 --> 02:35.984
- OK for start.
- Copy. OK for start.

02:36.091 --> 02:39.652
- OK, right throttle, 15 per cent.
- Copy, 15 per cent. Go for two.

02:39.762 --> 02:42.196
Two is up. ECS turbine is online.

02:42.298 --> 02:44.391
Copy. Nozzle coming in at 73 per cent.

02:44.667 --> 02:46.931
- Good to go.
- Copy. Good to go.

02:48.103 --> 02:50.037
That's a NATO bird. Stand it down.

02:50.139 --> 02:52.198
Cat four, abort.

02:52.308 --> 02:55.607
- What?
- That's bullshit! Are you kidding me?

02:55.711 --> 02:58.737
Abort, abort. Suspend cat four.
Launch is canceled.

02:58.848 --> 03:02.079
- Guys, come on. That's twice today.
- Yeah.

03:02.551 --> 03:06.078
They're wound up tight today.
Guess that's the price of peace.

03:06.188 --> 03:08.884
l cannot wait for this shit to be done.

03:09.992 --> 03:11.960
OK.

03:13.829 --> 03:15.888
Four more days.

03:19.768 --> 03:23.898
You know what l was reading the other day?
Bill Gates has more money than Peru.

03:24.006 --> 03:27.772
Now, he needs someone to fly his jets.
We oughta be flyin' for him.

03:27.877 --> 03:31.142
Yeah, but you know what?
l bet Bill won't let you fly upside down.

03:31.247 --> 03:35.445
Or fly for a rock star. l mean, if anybody
needs a good pilot, it's those guys.

03:35.551 --> 03:40.352
Whenever you turn around we've lost another
band to some shitty hack they got flyin' 'em.

03:40.623 --> 03:42.056
l mean, it's sad.

03:42.157 --> 03:46.287
Navy pilot coulda saved Ritchie Valens
from bein' a one-hit wonder. That's a fact.

03:46.395 --> 03:50.422
Cos that kid had talent.
You know, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Buddy Holly...

03:50.666 --> 03:54.796
- What about John Denver?
- Well, let's not get carried away.

04:03.345 --> 04:07.543
Let me ask you something. How fast
do you think we're headed into the wind?

04:08.150 --> 04:12.883
Chris, we're still on alert. lf Reigart
wanders up to the tower, we're dead.

04:13.789 --> 04:15.654
All right, let's do it.

04:15.758 --> 04:17.726
That's the spirit.

04:23.265 --> 04:26.462
- Rutherford. Right here.
- lncoming!

04:27.202 --> 04:30.638
You guys ready for a little lesson in physics?

04:30.739 --> 04:33.936
You never learn, kid.
l'm gonna take your money this week.

04:34.043 --> 04:36.511
Wind's blowin' up a gale.

04:36.745 --> 04:39.213
l bet you 20 bucks each
l catch it when it comes back.

04:39.315 --> 04:43.376
- Man, you'll lose a finger along with that 20.
- This one?

04:43.485 --> 04:46.648
All right.
Always happy to take an officer's money.

04:51.460 --> 04:54.224
( ''What'd l Say'' by Ray Charles)

05:14.650 --> 05:17.312
Hey, mama, don't you treat me wrong

05:17.586 --> 05:19.349
Come and love your daddy all night long

05:19.622 --> 05:21.590
All right now...

05:22.024 --> 05:24.015
Look at that, Stackhouse! Look!

05:24.126 --> 05:26.390
That is awesome!

05:26.495 --> 05:28.656
Hey, watch out for the catwalk!

05:28.764 --> 05:32.256
Well, tell me what'd l say, yeah

05:32.368 --> 05:34.962
Tell me what'd l say right now

05:35.070 --> 05:37.698
Tell me what'd l say

05:37.806 --> 05:39.899
Tell me what'd l say right now

05:40.409 --> 05:42.377
Tell me what'd l say

05:43.245 --> 05:44.371
Tell me what'd l say...

05:44.647 --> 05:46.808
Wilson!

05:49.685 --> 05:54.349
On the flight deck, heads up.
NATO helo landing spot six. Spot six.

06:11.807 --> 06:15.504
This is a lot of sorties for an action
that's winding down, Leslie.

06:15.611 --> 06:18.978
l'm struggling to get my pilots
15 hours a month up there.

06:19.181 --> 06:24.517
You understand how important it is that your
pilots don't stray from the agreed fly zones?

06:24.620 --> 06:28.112
- This treaty is fragile.
- The routes will be flown as ordered.

06:29.024 --> 06:31.322
The treaty depends on it.

06:31.994 --> 06:34.485
Aernout Van Lynden. He's with Sky News.

06:36.398 --> 06:40.300
- What is this?
- l invited him to report on the battle group.

06:40.402 --> 06:44.498
l'd like you to give him a tour of the ship.
Show him how everything works.

06:44.773 --> 06:49.972
Admiral, l find the press to be an intrusive
presence. lt inspires showing off.

06:50.079 --> 06:51.842
What's so funny, Admiral?

06:51.947 --> 06:55.610
You, Admiral,
are just what the conflict needs.

06:56.685 --> 07:00.121
- An uncomplicated man.
- l'll take that as a compliment.

07:03.459 --> 07:06.257
But wait a second.
Did you see the one with the, uh...?

07:06.361 --> 07:08.829
Well, well, well, looky here. Stackhouse.

07:08.931 --> 07:13.300
- l know that's not Burnett.
- Captain? Good to see you. All right.

07:13.402 --> 07:16.803
- Look at you, look at you.
- What are you guys doing back on board?

07:16.905 --> 07:19.203
Well, we just finished up in Sarajevo,

07:19.308 --> 07:22.072
and your Admiral wanted us
to pump you guys up.

07:22.177 --> 07:24.338
Sounds like Reigart. ''Be prepared.''

07:24.446 --> 07:28.780
Well, it's better to be prepared
than to be caught sleepin' in the field.

07:28.884 --> 07:31.478
Don't you forget what you're doin' here.

07:32.521 --> 07:35.513
What we're doing here?
Are you kidding me?

07:35.624 --> 07:39.321
Well, l'm eating Jell-O.
Uh, he's wipin' his hands.

07:42.231 --> 07:44.222
You know, everybody has a role to play.

07:44.333 --> 07:48.030
See, me, l'm a marine.
We take care of the serious business.

07:48.137 --> 07:52.039
You, you're a navy pilot,
and your role is to eat Jell-O.

07:53.609 --> 07:56.578
You don't get to pick your fight.
lt comes to you.

07:57.012 --> 07:58.570
Yeah, l get it.

07:58.680 --> 08:01.843
But at least give me a fight l can understand.

08:02.284 --> 08:06.414
Vukovar? Where's the place
we flew over the other day? Sreb...?

08:06.989 --> 08:08.388
Srebrenica.

08:08.490 --> 08:11.220
And good luck talkin' to someone at home:

08:11.326 --> 08:13.988
''Today's Tuesday.
We're helping these people.''

08:14.096 --> 08:18.624
''No, no, now it's switched around.
Now we're helping...'' lt's like a joke.

08:21.203 --> 08:24.570
- Just be glad it's over.
- Yeah. l am.

08:24.673 --> 08:26.641
(shouting)

08:28.310 --> 08:30.471
Look at these guys.

08:35.650 --> 08:37.982
See, that's exactly what l'm talking about.

08:38.086 --> 08:43.284
Everybody thinks they're gonna get a chance
to punch some Nazi in the face at Normandy.

08:43.392 --> 08:46.327
And those days are over. They are long gone.

08:46.829 --> 08:50.697
l used to think l'd get a chance to do it.
Now l realize l'll be eating Jell-O.

08:52.534 --> 08:54.661
- Are you gonna eat that, by the way?
- Now you wanna eat everybody's Jell-O.

08:54.770 --> 08:56.829
Lieutenant Burnett?

08:56.939 --> 09:00.033
Admiral Reigart would like
to see you immediately.

09:00.142 --> 09:03.168
- What the hell is this?
- Be prepared.

09:03.278 --> 09:05.178
Thank you.

09:05.280 --> 09:07.771
Maybe he wants to give you
his daughter's number.

09:08.250 --> 09:11.913
Did you see Tennessee on Saturday?
Boy, they looked good.

09:12.020 --> 09:14.079
l don't know anything, Lieutenant.

09:14.189 --> 09:18.592
Now, that is cynical.
And Southerners usually aren't that cynical.

09:18.694 --> 09:21.322
l give you a compliment
on how great your alma mater looks,

09:21.430 --> 09:25.161
and you think l'm tryin' to pump you
for information. What does he want?

09:25.267 --> 09:27.167
l guess you'll have to see, sir.

09:29.071 --> 09:31.005
- (knock at door)
- Come.

09:32.541 --> 09:36.705
- Lieutenant Burnett, sir.
- Master Chief O'Malley, thank you.

09:39.314 --> 09:41.043
Lieutenant Burnett.

09:41.149 --> 09:44.778
- Sir, about the football today, l know...
- l have your letter.

09:44.887 --> 09:47.822
l understand you're interested
in leaving the navy.

09:48.891 --> 09:50.791
Yes, sir. lt's time to move on.

09:50.893 --> 09:54.090
lf you don't mind my asking,
move on to what?

09:54.196 --> 09:55.163
Sir?

09:55.264 --> 09:59.724
Are you gonna fly commercial jets?
Troll the friendly skies in a bus?

10:02.337 --> 10:05.033
You've had an interesting career, Lieutenant.

10:05.140 --> 10:09.474
l remember when you came on board.
Smart as a whip, tons of potential.

10:09.945 --> 10:13.312
- Thank you, sir.
- And then, on September 23rd,

10:13.415 --> 10:17.146
you received a non-punitive letter of caution

10:17.252 --> 10:21.154
for disorderly behavior
at the China Fleet Club in Hong Kong.

10:21.256 --> 10:25.249
Another letter a month later
for something involving Chinese New Year

10:25.627 --> 10:27.822
at Pattaya Beach in Thailand.

10:27.930 --> 10:30.592
One can only imagine what that was.

10:37.239 --> 10:40.902
Just out of curiosity, Lieutenant,
what happened to you?

10:41.243 --> 10:45.202
Sir, l signed up to be a fighter pilot.
l didn't wanna be a cop.

10:45.314 --> 10:50.877
l certainly didn't wanna be a cop walkin' the
beat in a neighborhood no one cares about.

10:50.986 --> 10:53.352
That and the routine on the ship
kinda wore me out.

10:53.455 --> 10:55.753
- The routine?
- The routine.

10:56.625 --> 11:00.584
What you don't know from experience
is that the routine, the systems checks,

11:00.662 --> 11:05.690
the drills, the maintaining of discipline,
that's what you do to prepare for war.

11:06.702 --> 11:09.728
- We're not at war, sir.
- Yes, we are.

11:09.838 --> 11:14.172
Unless we're parked in San Diego Bay, you're
at war every time you step on this boat.

11:14.276 --> 11:17.439
- You understand that?
- No, sir, l do not understand.

11:19.448 --> 11:21.473
lf we're at war, why don't we act like it?

11:21.583 --> 11:25.644
Cos as far as l can tell, we go out,
we fly around and we come back.

11:26.388 --> 11:31.883
Maybe we're pretending we're in the fight,
but we're not fighting, we're watching.

11:31.994 --> 11:36.727
You should be glad you're not in a fight.
With your attitude you wouldn't last long.

11:36.832 --> 11:40.893
Sir, l've given the navy seven good years.
l think l've served my country.

11:41.136 --> 11:45.470
You wouldn't know the first thing
about serving your country.

11:47.075 --> 11:49.600
You have two weeks remaining on this tour.

11:49.711 --> 11:53.670
You will serve them in a manner
befitting a naval officer.

11:55.317 --> 11:57.217
l'll keep your letter in my pocket.

11:57.319 --> 12:00.755
At the end of those two weeks,
you be on your way.

12:13.001 --> 12:14.798
You're dismissed, mister.

12:14.903 --> 12:16.700
Sir.

12:29.051 --> 12:31.417
O'Malley told me you dropped your letter.

12:31.520 --> 12:33.852
He's tellin' the truth.

12:34.389 --> 12:36.949
So you're gonna break up the band, huh?

12:37.059 --> 12:39.027
Oh, that's good.

12:39.127 --> 12:43.291
Hey, listen, Chris. Listen, l thought
you were kidding about getting out.

12:43.398 --> 12:46.731
You telling me l gotta find another navigator?
ls that the deal?

12:46.835 --> 12:50.271
l can't do it anymore. l'm done. l'm sorry.

13:04.152 --> 13:08.953
(PA system) All hands. An air contact
believed to have originated in the North Pole

13:09.057 --> 13:12.720
has been spotted
and is inbound to USS Carl Vinson.

13:13.428 --> 13:16.056
No, no, it's good to hear your voice. No, no.

13:16.565 --> 13:19.159
Yeah, they're taking care of us great.

13:19.267 --> 13:22.168
They're putting up tinsel,
and it's very Christmasy.

13:22.270 --> 13:25.330
No, Dad, don't wake her.
Just tell her l said ''merry Christmas.''

13:25.607 --> 13:28.167
We're disappointed
that we won't be seeing you.

13:28.276 --> 13:30.471
Well, you may get to see a lot of me soon.

13:30.579 --> 13:34.413
Well, we understand. You got
important things to do over there.

13:34.516 --> 13:36.279
Dad, l gotta go.

13:36.785 --> 13:39.310
- We're very proud of you.
- Dad, l gotta get goin'.

13:39.421 --> 13:42.083
- All right, l love you.
- Bye.

13:48.964 --> 13:50.761
That son of a bitch!

13:50.899 --> 13:54.198
Did you see this? He put us
on the holiday mission. Goddammit.

13:54.302 --> 13:58.295
- Well, at least we get to fly.
- Yeah, during the one good meal of the year.

13:58.406 --> 14:03.309
- lt's almost like he doesn't like us.
- No. You, not me. You.

14:03.712 --> 14:06.448
(PA) Merry Christmas, girls and boys.
On the flight deck it's show time.

14:06.448 --> 14:07.437
(PA) Merry Christmas, girls and boys.
On the flight deck it's show time.

14:07.549 --> 14:12.418
Aircraft remaining for the NATO
solo photo reconnaissance mission.

14:13.488 --> 14:16.116
He's got a brand-new car

14:17.492 --> 14:19.960
Looks like a Jaguar

14:21.396 --> 14:23.990
lt's got leather seats

14:25.267 --> 14:27.735
lt's got a CD player...

14:27.836 --> 14:30.361
(''player'' echoing)

14:37.812 --> 14:41.009
Wouldn't it be great to look back
and there's Britney Spears?

14:41.116 --> 14:45.917
But wait, she wants to try flyin' the plane.
Yeah, just move the stick right there. Yeah.

15:07.175 --> 15:09.769
We'll start over again

15:11.446 --> 15:13.880
Grow ourselves new skin

15:15.417 --> 15:18.011
Get a house in Devon

15:19.354 --> 15:22.346
Drink cider from a lemon

15:31.800 --> 15:36.760
(TV) The CincinnatiAccord verifies Serbia's
commitment to a lasting peace in Yugoslavia.

15:49.584 --> 15:54.248
l welcome the announcement
that NATO will leave the region.

16:14.142 --> 16:22.572
Coordinates 3 0 1 5 0 6.5 1 1 5 0 confirmed.
Sectors are all concurrent.

16:22.684 --> 16:25.949
- You sure about that?
- l'm readin' it right here, pal.

16:26.354 --> 16:28.322
Yeah, well, uh...

16:29.724 --> 16:34.923
the Serbs must've bought some old U-boats,
cos we're flyin' over a lake.

16:38.700 --> 16:40.065
Goddammit.

16:40.168 --> 16:45.765
And a warm thank you to the US intelligence
community, ladies and gentlemen.

16:49.978 --> 16:54.938
Yet another useless joyride at the cost
of mere millions to the US taxpayer.

16:55.050 --> 16:59.749
Hey, hang on. Scope showing activity
in section four alpha to our left.

16:59.854 --> 17:02.015
Must be in that forested area.

17:02.123 --> 17:06.617
That's the demilitarized zone.
There shouldn't be any activity.

17:06.728 --> 17:10.892
Yeah, l know, l know. But the scope
doesn't lie. There it is. Let's check it out.

17:10.999 --> 17:14.526
We're not supposed to fly that section.
The brass'll have a shit fit.

17:14.636 --> 17:17.730
Hey, we're on recon,
so let's recon something.

17:17.839 --> 17:21.069
Stack, it's probably just
some locals fooling around.

17:21.175 --> 17:24.942
Could be a good opportunity
to test our shiny new digital camera.

17:25.046 --> 17:28.446
Why do l listen to you? All right, let's do it.

17:33.254 --> 17:36.621
ECM is clear. GPS is synced
with new coordinates.

17:36.725 --> 17:39.489
Steady up 0-3-4 and fly the director.

17:44.799 --> 17:48.200
- lDEM camera is at speed.
- Got it. Going into burner.

17:49.738 --> 17:52.502
On condition. Stand by for roll... now.

17:57.145 --> 17:59.113
Rolling digital.

18:06.988 --> 18:09.388
(shouting in Serbo-Croatian)

18:10.692 --> 18:12.785
Smile, guys. You're on TV.

18:55.403 --> 18:57.735
(jet flying overhead)

19:02.844 --> 19:06.280
- Aren't you gonna miss all this excitement?
- Oh, absolutely.

19:23.298 --> 19:26.597
- What is it?
- Holy shit! We're being painted!

19:26.701 --> 19:27.690
What?!

19:33.141 --> 19:35.336
Shit! They fired! Scoop it, now!

19:35.610 --> 19:38.272
- Pull up! Get the nose moving!
- Roger!

19:38.379 --> 19:41.974
- l see a single missile tracking on us.
- l don't see it. Call my turn.

19:42.083 --> 19:44.381
Slice left. Hard!

19:45.320 --> 19:47.049
Jesus Christ!

19:47.155 --> 19:49.248
Where is it?

19:49.357 --> 19:51.325
Reverse right!

19:52.560 --> 19:54.528
Try to break the lock!

20:02.604 --> 20:05.402
- Golden Eagle, we have been engaged.
- Roger.

20:06.774 --> 20:09.436
- Put out decoy flares.
- Copy.

20:11.012 --> 20:14.448
- No joy.
- Where is it, goddammit? Where is it?!

20:14.549 --> 20:17.040
l can't see shit! Where is he?!

20:26.728 --> 20:30.164
Jesus Christ! Second missile in the air!
Three miles and closing!

20:30.265 --> 20:33.962
- Pull up! Change your vector!
- l got him! l got him!

20:40.275 --> 20:41.105
(yells)

20:44.846 --> 20:47.337
We need a bigger heat decoy.

20:55.089 --> 20:57.182
We're screwed!

20:58.092 --> 21:02.495
Missile's closing. 2.8... 1.8... 1 mile!

21:02.864 --> 21:04.855
Drop the fuel tanks and pull up!

21:14.208 --> 21:16.335
Good fireball!

21:16.611 --> 21:18.943
Clear on top. Coming back down.

21:19.781 --> 21:23.717
l got two missiles in sight,
both tracking for the fireball.

21:24.852 --> 21:27.218
That's it! One down. Up we go.

21:31.159 --> 21:35.027
- Where's the second?
- No joy. l don't have it in sight.

21:36.864 --> 21:39.230
- He's back on us. Push over!
- Copy.

21:40.368 --> 21:42.336
Hard left.

21:44.038 --> 21:47.997
- l'm going for a head-on pass.
- Here he comes! Head on, right side!

21:49.444 --> 21:52.038
He clipped us! Part of the tail's gone!

21:52.146 --> 21:55.775
- Flight controls going to shit!
- Where is it?

21:58.586 --> 22:02.078
He's coming back.
Missile arcing right. Break!

22:02.190 --> 22:04.920
l got no turn left, Chris!
The controls are shot!

22:05.026 --> 22:06.994
Nose break, right!

22:16.304 --> 22:17.430
Shit!

22:27.382 --> 22:30.374
Shit! Seat eject! Eject, eject!

24:14.122 --> 24:16.090
Goddammit.

24:16.390 --> 24:18.381
(Christmas song plays)

24:20.728 --> 24:24.459
- You throw a hell of a party, sir.
- Yeah, l really like Christmas.

24:24.565 --> 24:27.796
Sir, we've lost a bird, an F-18. Feet dry.

24:31.239 --> 24:33.332
Ark Angel Zero Six.

24:33.441 --> 24:35.500
Burnett and Stackhouse.

24:35.610 --> 24:38.135
Goddammit. l put 'em on the holiday mission.

24:38.246 --> 24:40.680
- Any beacon activity?
- Not yet, Admiral.

24:40.782 --> 24:44.616
We have a radar plot of flight path
from feet dry to last contact.

24:44.719 --> 24:47.381
Here in yellow is the assigned path.

24:50.591 --> 24:52.923
ln the red is actual.

24:59.467 --> 25:01.731
Lost contact is here.

25:02.937 --> 25:05.235
They're off-mission. What the hell happened?

25:05.339 --> 25:09.400
lt'll be tough to pick up a beacon signal,
even from a satellite.

25:09.510 --> 25:11.671
The terrain is extremely rough.

25:11.779 --> 25:13.610
Damn weather's sure not helping.

25:13.714 --> 25:16.615
Contact Admiral Piquet,
alert NATO chain of command.

25:16.717 --> 25:20.585
Make sure we have a FLASH op rep
out over all US national circuits.

25:20.688 --> 25:22.781
And get through to Admiral Donnelly.

25:22.890 --> 25:25.450
- No names.
- No names, sir.

25:45.213 --> 25:47.704
Stack! Stackhouse!

25:48.349 --> 25:50.317
Stack!

25:51.552 --> 25:53.679
Are you OK?

25:54.322 --> 25:55.687
Yeah.

25:56.157 --> 25:59.183
- Shit, man. Are you OK?
- Yeah, l'm OK. You look terrible.

25:59.293 --> 26:01.557
Yeah? Hey, man, that looks pretty bad.

26:01.662 --> 26:04.028
Let me see this. Oh, man.

26:05.066 --> 26:09.366
Oh, we gotta change this.
We need a field dressing on this.

26:10.571 --> 26:13.005
Shit. Squeeze right here.

26:18.212 --> 26:20.180
So...

26:21.215 --> 26:23.706
where are we, Mr Navigator Man?

26:25.186 --> 26:27.746
ln the mountains north of Miciovic.

26:28.956 --> 26:31.254
You think they saw us eject?

26:33.327 --> 26:36.023
We are not gonna be around to find out.

26:37.231 --> 26:40.291
Reigart'll be curious
what happened to his $40 million plane.

26:40.401 --> 26:43.564
Forget it. l already tried.
You need to get to higher ground.

26:43.671 --> 26:45.468
What?

26:45.873 --> 26:48.341
You think it'll work up there?

26:48.442 --> 26:50.569
Yeah. Just get high enough.

26:53.714 --> 26:55.909
All right. All right, sit tight.

26:58.586 --> 27:00.747
- Hey, Chris.
- What?

27:01.188 --> 27:04.419
Listen, l should've dodged
that second missile.

27:06.227 --> 27:09.560
Yeah, you should've. You blew it.
You took me down with you.

27:09.664 --> 27:11.996
l thought you had great reflexes.
What happened?

27:12.099 --> 27:17.298
l used to have, like, a good pilot.
Man, you're slippin'. You need to watch it.

27:34.622 --> 27:35.953
Oh, God.

27:46.701 --> 27:48.601
(cheering)

29:20.194 --> 29:22.059
Oh, shit.

29:36.510 --> 29:38.842
(shouting in Serbo-Croatian)

30:00.301 --> 30:01.393
Urgh!

30:03.037 --> 30:05.335
Oh, goddammit.

30:09.443 --> 30:11.411
(muttering) Son of a bitch.

31:18.145 --> 31:20.545
Reconnaissance mission, yes?

31:22.516 --> 31:25.076
Not bombing mission, right?

31:27.254 --> 31:29.586
You photograph?

31:36.897 --> 31:38.865
(soldiers laugh)

31:42.770 --> 31:44.965
You alone?

31:45.372 --> 31:47.340
Correct.

32:44.298 --> 32:45.856
No!

32:51.472 --> 32:53.406
(whistles)

34:00.674 --> 34:03.837
Alpha Whiskey, this is
Ark Angel Zero Six. Over.

34:05.079 --> 34:10.380
(garbled over static) Alpha Whiskey, this is
ArkAngel Zero Six. Over. Can you read me?

34:11.085 --> 34:14.282
- What is that?
- Sorry, sir. There's some interference.

34:14.388 --> 34:16.686
lt's the beacon from the ejector seat, sir.

34:16.790 --> 34:19.020
- Well, shut it off.
- Aye aye, sir.

34:19.126 --> 34:23.495
Alpha Echo, Alpha Echo, Alpha Whiskey
directs cease buzzer on Zero Six.

34:23.597 --> 34:25.621
(beeping)

34:32.438 --> 34:34.168
(beeping stops)

34:34.842 --> 34:38.608
Alpha Whiskey, this is ArkAngel Zero Six.
Over. Do you read?

34:38.712 --> 34:40.047
Zero Six, this is Alpha Whiskey.
Read you loud and clear. Go ahead.

34:40.047 --> 34:42.777
Zero Six, this is Alpha Whiskey.
Read you loud and clear. Go ahead.

34:44.717 --> 34:49.155
Ark Angel is down. l say again.
Ark Angel is down, and l am on the run.

34:49.255 --> 34:51.884
Slow down. What is your count?

34:58.198 --> 35:00.530
Minus one. Stackhouse. They shot him.

35:01.835 --> 35:04.030
No names over the net.

35:05.739 --> 35:07.502
Confirm your last.

35:07.608 --> 35:09.735
Minus one. Confirmed.

35:09.843 --> 35:13.335
Serbs in camo shot my pilot.

35:15.249 --> 35:19.015
You're saying a uniformed soldier
killed your flight officer?

35:19.586 --> 35:22.180
No, l'm saying they executed him.

35:22.289 --> 35:26.157
They talked... They were talking to him,
then they shot him in the head.

35:27.728 --> 35:30.925
All right, calm down, son.
We're working on it. Wait one.

35:31.031 --> 35:35.832
- How soon can your team be ready?
- We're ready now, sir. All l need is a ride.

35:36.036 --> 35:38.596
Zero Six, consult your chart.

35:39.840 --> 35:42.502
Reposition to rally point three.

35:43.010 --> 35:48.676
l read 133-41. Maintain radio silence.

35:48.782 --> 35:51.808
We're comin' to get you, son.
Just get to the rally point.

35:51.919 --> 35:54.683
- Understood?
- Zero Six copies. Out.

35:56.623 --> 36:00.059
- Contact Piquet and Donnelly.
- Aye aye, sir.

36:00.160 --> 36:02.890
Let 'em know l need a green light
to go get my boy.

37:04.057 --> 37:06.218
Command and control
comes from Red Crown.

37:06.326 --> 37:12.060
You men have three slicks loaded with
2.75 rocket pods and guns at your disposal.

37:12.165 --> 37:14.099
Use advisedly.

37:14.201 --> 37:17.193
l want gimbal attachments
for all fast ropers.

37:17.538 --> 37:21.133
Team leaders report to me
as soon as your squad is ready.

37:21.842 --> 37:24.003
- (knock on door)
- Come.

37:25.712 --> 37:28.408
Admiral, what's going on down there?

37:28.515 --> 37:32.474
We have an F-18 down in southern Bosnia.
One pilot suspected dead.

37:32.819 --> 37:35.788
Who authorized a search and rescue?

37:35.889 --> 37:39.791
- l did.
- Call it off. Stand down, Admiral.

37:40.727 --> 37:44.823
Maybe l didn't make myself clear. We have
pilots down. One probably already dead.

37:44.932 --> 37:48.698
Admiral, l have spoken personally
to Bosnian military commanders.

37:48.802 --> 37:50.929
They say the shoot-down was perpetrated

37:51.038 --> 37:55.134
by renegade forces
attempting to disrupt the peace process.

37:55.242 --> 37:56.937
Of course they say that.

37:57.044 --> 38:01.743
They're also claiming, Admiral,
that your aircraft was way off-mission.

38:01.848 --> 38:05.716
lf we fly in there we create a shitstorm,
and the whole treaty will collapse.

38:05.819 --> 38:09.448
Admiral, Burnett says
that Serb troops murdered his pilot.

38:09.556 --> 38:11.888
ls your pilot an expert on Bosnia?

38:11.992 --> 38:15.655
Can he distinguish between the uniforms
of Serbs, Croats and Muslims?

38:15.762 --> 38:19.823
Because l can't, and l've been
posted here for five years.

38:20.233 --> 38:23.862
lf your man is in danger,
he should get himself into a safe zone.

38:23.971 --> 38:26.906
That is what he's briefed and trained to do.

38:28.075 --> 38:32.535
Listen, Leslie. l can have your fleet
commander order you to stand down,

38:32.646 --> 38:35.240
or you can do it yourself.

40:38.271 --> 40:40.796
Alpha Whiskey, this is Zero Six. Come in.

40:42.375 --> 40:44.275
Zero Six, go ahead.

40:44.377 --> 40:47.312
Zero Six is at rally point three
and standing by.

40:48.815 --> 40:52.273
Zero Six, latest intel
says your current location

40:52.385 --> 40:56.253
undoable for pickup.
Stand by to copy rendezvous point.

40:56.356 --> 40:59.325
Say again your last.
l am at the rendezvous point.

41:01.828 --> 41:04.319
You need to hump it out to a safe zone.

41:04.431 --> 41:08.333
l set lP Cadillac. Canada 1-5,

41:08.969 --> 41:11.802
Virginia 2-0. Read back.

41:25.786 --> 41:27.754
No.

41:28.955 --> 41:31.321
Negative. Negative.

41:31.958 --> 41:34.927
l do not understand.
Why is this spot not doable for pickup?

41:35.428 --> 41:37.089
l am good to go.

41:37.197 --> 41:40.189
l say again, l am good to go now.

41:40.300 --> 41:42.200
Burnett!

41:46.673 --> 41:52.373
Zero Six, you are a combat naval aviator.
Start acting like one.

41:53.213 --> 41:56.910
You've been shot down.
Life is tough. l am very sorry.

41:57.284 --> 42:01.516
Now you pull yourself together.
You do whatever it takes.

42:01.621 --> 42:04.647
Create some angles between
you and your pursuers.

42:04.758 --> 42:09.422
Use your training. Use your head. Evade
and survive, and we will bring you home.

42:09.529 --> 42:11.429
Understand? We will bring you home!

42:11.731 --> 42:13.631
(shouting)

42:21.575 --> 42:23.543
Zero Six?

42:26.980 --> 42:27.776
Zero Six?

42:32.319 --> 42:33.980
Someone's coming.

42:40.093 --> 42:42.288
(frequency static)

42:44.064 --> 42:45.998
- We lost the signal, sir.
- Shit.

42:46.099 --> 42:49.034
- Where is he? Triangulate his position.
- We're on it, sir.

43:04.718 --> 43:07.186
We're tracking him in the SClF, sir.

43:07.587 --> 43:09.555
On me.

43:28.909 --> 43:30.877
At ease.

43:39.986 --> 43:44.252
Sir, we were able to track the emergency
radio signal to somewhere in this radius.

43:44.357 --> 43:48.987
lt's pretty far away. But we think
the pilot transmission came from here.

43:53.566 --> 43:58.401
This is imagery from a Northrop Grumman
relay satellite downlinked through Stuttgart.

43:58.505 --> 44:02.908
We've hot-wired it for heat image,
and it's streaming in now.

44:04.044 --> 44:06.035
This isn't strictly legal, sir.

44:15.655 --> 44:17.748
OK, here we go.

44:30.470 --> 44:32.529
- That's Burnett?
- Yes, sir.

44:36.943 --> 44:39.241
(shouts in Serbo-Croatian)

44:48.788 --> 44:50.619
Fuck!

44:53.593 --> 44:55.925
What's going on? He's down.

44:56.496 --> 44:58.657
He been shot?

45:00.967 --> 45:03.333
They're almost on him.

45:07.974 --> 45:10.067
Son of a bitch.

45:10.910 --> 45:14.073
- Why isn't he moving?
- Come on, Burnett, move.

45:15.782 --> 45:17.181
(Reigart) They're right on him!

45:32.265 --> 45:34.233
What are they doing?

45:51.518 --> 45:54.351
(issues orders)

46:08.034 --> 46:09.968
What's goin' on?

46:24.818 --> 46:25.876
Has he been killed?

47:16.469 --> 47:18.767
He's moving. That's him.

47:24.677 --> 47:27.737
Briggs, stay on it.
Resize and widen broadband.

47:27.847 --> 47:31.510
- Stay with him. Stay with him.
- Plug it in with NSA.

47:31.618 --> 47:33.449
- What the hell's going on?
- Damn it.

47:33.553 --> 47:37.853
- That's not us. The door's closing.
- Well, fix it, for chrissakes!

47:37.957 --> 47:39.925
We're down. lt's cooked.

47:40.126 --> 47:44.529
l want intel on this situation.
Who's chasing him, and why? Understand?

47:44.631 --> 47:46.394
Yes, sir.

48:18.431 --> 48:20.331
- (knock at door)
- Come.

48:23.102 --> 48:26.037
Sorry, sir. Nothing in the last hour.

48:28.975 --> 48:30.966
l was trying to motivate him, Tom.

48:31.077 --> 48:32.635
Sir?

48:32.745 --> 48:35.145
Burnett. ln the radio room.

48:36.249 --> 48:37.944
l was...

48:38.051 --> 48:43.284
l was trying to motivate him,
but... maybe l carried it too far.

48:43.389 --> 48:46.415
Called him by his name. How stupid. Damn.

48:48.595 --> 48:50.620
Just human, sir.

48:54.100 --> 48:56.125
- Tom.
- Sir?

48:57.604 --> 49:01.506
lt's why l push 'em so hard.
For times like these.

49:10.083 --> 49:12.347
- Permission to speak freely, sir.
- Come on, Tom.

49:12.452 --> 49:16.548
You're gonna say whatever
you're gonna say. Don't patronize me.

49:16.656 --> 49:21.025
Sir, what in the hell are we doin'? We've got
a guy on the ground, and we're sittin' here.

49:21.127 --> 49:23.095
lt's a complicated situation.

49:23.196 --> 49:25.756
Why isn't this all over the news?

49:25.865 --> 49:30.768
Why isn't the president on the phone to Pale,
or whoever, makin' sure this kid gets out?

49:31.037 --> 49:34.029
Well, he was off-mission.
Piquet has a point there.

49:34.140 --> 49:37.598
All due respect,
Piquet's got his own agenda, sir.

49:39.078 --> 49:42.673
Now, this kid might not have
the best attitude, but he's no idiot.

49:42.782 --> 49:47.082
- He says he's gettin' shot at, l believe him.
- What the hell do you expect me to do?

49:47.186 --> 49:51.384
Command tells me l gotta sit on my hands.
What else can l do?

49:53.693 --> 49:54.990
Right.

49:55.094 --> 49:57.927
l forgot. lt's not your call.

49:58.097 --> 50:00.861
You're damn right it's not my call!

50:04.270 --> 50:07.637
Apology, sir. Of course,
you can't do anything.

51:00.460 --> 51:05.090
(TV) lt's been confirmed that an American
combat aircraft, an F-18 Super Hornet,

51:05.198 --> 51:07.291
has been shot down over Bosnia.

51:07.400 --> 51:11.734
lt was hit over Miciovic in southern Bosnia
at around 6:00 yesterday morning.

51:11.838 --> 51:12.361
Mr Burnett?

51:12.472 --> 51:16.067
The pilot is feared dead, but his navigator
is believed to have survived.

51:16.175 --> 51:17.301
lt's about your son.

51:17.510 --> 51:21.776
Their names are being withheld,
pending notification of their next of kin.

51:22.148 --> 51:25.117
We still don't know who shot the F-18 down.

51:25.218 --> 51:28.346
lt's the Serbs who control
most ofsouthern Bosnia,

51:28.454 --> 51:30.752
but they allege insurgents are to blame,

51:30.857 --> 51:34.258
and say they're doing everything
to help locate the crew.

51:34.360 --> 51:39.320
lt's also unclear what, if any, impact
this incident will have on NATO's withdrawal...

52:37.054 --> 52:39.022
Admiral.

52:42.593 --> 52:45.858
You and l have known each other
for how long? Five years?

52:45.963 --> 52:48.022
Something like that.

52:49.033 --> 52:52.264
l've always commended your work
to your superior officers.

52:52.369 --> 52:54.963
l've sent you information
whenever you requested it.

52:55.072 --> 52:57.233
Thank you, sir. l appreciate your support.

52:57.341 --> 52:59.707
And this is the thanks l get?

53:00.477 --> 53:03.310
We have one disagreement
over how to handle a downed pilot,

53:03.414 --> 53:05.211
and you stab me in the back?

53:05.316 --> 53:09.047
You go to the media, to my contact,
and you make me look like an asshole.

53:09.153 --> 53:12.645
You brought him on my boat.
His press report is accurate.

53:13.190 --> 53:15.385
Our man is down behind enemy lines!

53:15.492 --> 53:17.926
Now what the fuck is the problem?!

53:18.829 --> 53:23.027
Do you have any idea how much damage this
incident may cause to the peace process?

53:23.133 --> 53:27.297
All l know, Admiral, is that the American
people want their pilot back.

53:27.404 --> 53:31.932
Exactly! Americans. All you care about
is your own damn pilots!

53:33.911 --> 53:36.903
What happens when
the fighting starts again?

53:37.014 --> 53:41.508
Will America recommit its forces
to stop a major war?

53:42.019 --> 53:46.581
No. You don't have any control
over that little detail, do you?

53:50.461 --> 53:53.521
You might have helped save
your man today, Reigart.

53:53.631 --> 53:56.156
And l emphasize might.

53:57.268 --> 54:01.034
But you have risked the lives
of thousands tomorrow.

54:49.386 --> 54:51.513
(distant clanking)

54:53.357 --> 54:55.723
(child's laughter echoing)

55:10.040 --> 55:12.304
(echoing laughter continues)

55:28.559 --> 55:30.925
(adult voice)

56:02.860 --> 56:05.488
(truck engine starts)

56:37.928 --> 56:39.088
Shit!

56:42.099 --> 56:45.125
(men shouting in Serbo-Croatian)

57:26.877 --> 57:28.845
Shit.

57:49.099 --> 57:50.066
Argh!

59:20.891 --> 59:23.416
Alpha Whiskey, Alpha Whiskey,
this is Ark Angel.

59:23.527 --> 59:24.585
(knock at door)

59:25.062 --> 59:26.893
They've got a signal. lt's Burnett.

59:26.997 --> 59:31.331
Ark Angel Zero Six, this is Alpha Whiskey.
Go ahead, Zero Six.

59:31.435 --> 59:34.734
l'm on course with your last instructions.

59:35.138 --> 59:37.106
(breathing heavily)

59:37.207 --> 59:42.167
Am keyed up and waiting for your...
waiting for you to name the fairway.

59:43.247 --> 59:46.239
Zero Six, this is Alpha Whiskey.
How you doin', son?

59:47.551 --> 59:49.382
l don't know. You tell me, sir.

59:49.486 --> 59:55.220
The hard bit's over. You need to get yourself,
uh, five clicks east, uh, to the sweet spot.

59:55.325 --> 59:57.293
Understood?

01:00:04.034 --> 01:00:06.298
Roger. Understand that spot to be friendly.

01:00:06.403 --> 01:00:08.394
Good for birds ?

01:00:08.505 --> 01:00:10.905
That's affirmative. Spot is friendly.

01:00:11.008 --> 01:00:15.672
You need to get there, stay out of trouble
and Big Mother will pick you up.

01:00:15.779 --> 01:00:17.406
Next contact at, um...

01:00:17.614 --> 01:00:18.672
1700.

01:00:18.782 --> 01:00:20.750
Roger.

01:00:32.429 --> 01:00:34.420
Alpha Whiskey?

01:00:35.198 --> 01:00:36.790
Uh, go ahead, Zero Six.

01:00:42.472 --> 01:00:45.339
Sir, l shouldn't have left Stackhouse.

01:00:49.413 --> 01:00:51.381
Distract him.

01:00:51.481 --> 01:00:56.544
Uh, Zero Six, your last transmission was
garbled. Let's talk about your, um... your gear.

01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:59.213
How's it holding up?

01:01:04.695 --> 01:01:07.323
The gear's good. l have a basic pack.

01:01:07.431 --> 01:01:09.797
l left some of it at the crash site.

01:01:12.602 --> 01:01:16.003
l guess l got rattled when l ejected at Mach 3.

01:01:19.543 --> 01:01:22.068
You still got your boots,
haven't you, cowboy?

01:01:22.179 --> 01:01:24.909
Roger. They were tied on.

01:01:26.817 --> 01:01:28.978
You got it made.

01:01:32.089 --> 01:01:36.651
You're an optimist, sir.
See, l had you figured for a grouch.

01:01:40.764 --> 01:01:44.291
OK, Zero Six, just make it to the RP.

01:01:45.302 --> 01:01:46.496
Roger.

01:01:47.003 --> 01:01:49.198
Are you gonna be there, sir?

01:01:49.306 --> 01:01:51.774
That's affirmative, son. Out.

01:01:57.581 --> 01:01:59.446
He's here.

01:01:59.549 --> 01:02:01.915
Yes, sir. l suggest we place him here.

01:02:02.018 --> 01:02:06.284
lt's open ground near the town of Hac,
well inside the safe zone.

01:02:07.758 --> 01:02:10.192
All right, let's go for the extraction.

01:02:47.397 --> 01:02:53.302
(Reigart) ..command area responsibility.
lngress will be north, egress south.

01:02:54.304 --> 01:03:00.402
From the radio contacts, you can see he has
basically circled back towards the crash site.

01:03:00.510 --> 01:03:04.913
Call sign is ''Avalanche.''
Authenticate: ''Romeo Two, X-ray.''

01:03:05.549 --> 01:03:10.486
Continue: ''Bulldog.'' Delay: ''Cycle.''
Abort is ''Washdown.''

01:03:11.221 --> 01:03:14.748
Aircraft down is ''Cobalt.''
Success is ''Ripper.''

01:03:15.659 --> 01:03:18.924
- Captain, you can take it from here.
- Thank you, sir.

01:03:19.262 --> 01:03:23.722
Bravo will establish a perimeter, then
haul ass back to the helo on my command...

01:03:23.834 --> 01:03:25.768
Admiral Reigart.

01:03:25.869 --> 01:03:29.134
Let me introduce Colonel Brigand.
He will conduct the pickup.

01:03:29.239 --> 01:03:31.867
- Sir, my team is ready now.
- Get me Admiral Donnelly.

01:03:31.975 --> 01:03:35.741
l have spoken with Admiral Donnelly
and have his full support.

01:03:35.846 --> 01:03:37.837
You will stand down.

01:04:25.262 --> 01:04:28.095
( ''The Wanderer'' by Dion on radio)

01:05:09.139 --> 01:05:11.437
(Stackhouse, whispering) Chris.

01:05:21.618 --> 01:05:23.779
( ''The Wanderer'' continues)

01:05:33.663 --> 01:05:34.925
Hey!

01:05:49.779 --> 01:05:51.440
Yeah.

01:06:13.637 --> 01:06:15.662
You American?

01:06:19.109 --> 01:06:21.373
(speaks Serbo-Croatian)

01:06:23.179 --> 01:06:24.976
Nine millimeters?

01:06:27.717 --> 01:06:29.685
Nine millimeter.

01:07:05.922 --> 01:07:07.787
Do you have water?

01:07:07.891 --> 01:07:09.916
Water? No water.

01:07:20.637 --> 01:07:22.605
Thanks.

01:07:29.446 --> 01:07:31.414
lt's good.

01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:38.444
lce Cube.

01:07:38.555 --> 01:07:41.183
Yeah. l like lce Cube.

01:07:41.291 --> 01:07:44.488
l like all hip-hop, uh, rap music.

01:07:45.095 --> 01:07:48.622
West Coast, East Coast.
NWA, Public Enemy.

01:07:49.432 --> 01:07:51.127
(raps)  They said stop, freeze

01:07:51.234 --> 01:07:55.432
l got froze up
because l'm public enemy number one

01:07:55.705 --> 01:07:58.071
One, one, one, one

01:08:01.578 --> 01:08:04.376
That's good. That's good, that's good.

01:08:16.725 --> 01:08:19.160
You know where we're going?

01:08:19.261 --> 01:08:20.229
Hac.

01:08:20.330 --> 01:08:22.821
Hac? That's good. Good.

01:08:36.779 --> 01:08:38.839
Jesus Christ!

01:08:41.484 --> 01:08:43.782
Tell him to go!

01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:19.384
Hey, come on! Come on!

01:09:45.948 --> 01:09:48.417
Hey. Bonjour.

01:09:48.685 --> 01:09:51.210
Come on. Come on, let's go. Let's go, OK?

01:09:51.321 --> 01:09:54.882
Whoa, whoa. Hold it. l'm an American soldier
that's been shot down.

01:09:54.991 --> 01:09:57.084
Shut up.

01:09:57.694 --> 01:10:00.094
(speaking Serbo-Croatian)

01:10:00.997 --> 01:10:04.592
- What were you bombing?
- No bombing. We were taking photographs.

01:10:04.701 --> 01:10:07.169
Photographs of what? Of what?!

01:10:07.604 --> 01:10:10.505
Lokar's come back here again,
killing everyone.

01:10:10.607 --> 01:10:15.408
lt's true. Lokar killed everyone. Children,
women... Buried them up in the hills.

01:10:15.511 --> 01:10:18.446
ln the hills?
Yes, l saw them. l saw the graves.

01:10:21.451 --> 01:10:24.386
Yes, l saw them. l saw the bodies in the hills.

01:10:24.487 --> 01:10:27.047
Tell him. l am an American.
l am on your side.

01:10:27.156 --> 01:10:31.058
- That's what l'm sayin'. We're on your...
- Then you go outside.

01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:33.025
Tell them you are an American.

01:10:33.129 --> 01:10:35.859
- They don't kill American.
- lce Cube, tell them.

01:10:35.965 --> 01:10:38.900
Tell this guy that we have
photographs that can help...

01:10:39.002 --> 01:10:42.438
Bullshit!

01:10:42.538 --> 01:10:44.733
America say they make them sign deal.

01:10:48.845 --> 01:10:51.040
- l swear to God...
- But they already break it!

01:10:51.147 --> 01:10:54.207
America government for shit! Now go!

01:11:06.729 --> 01:11:09.129
(heavily distorted breathing)

01:12:45.261 --> 01:12:47.320
(static)

01:12:58.074 --> 01:13:00.304
(speaks Serbo-Croatian)

01:13:08.284 --> 01:13:10.343
(gunfire continues)

01:15:37.767 --> 01:15:39.701
Hey, hey, hey...

01:15:39.802 --> 01:15:41.736
lt's OK. lt's me.

01:15:43.306 --> 01:15:45.103
Come on.

01:15:58.888 --> 01:16:00.549
Time?

01:16:00.656 --> 01:16:02.556
Three minutes, sir.

01:16:11.467 --> 01:16:13.435
Stop! Shh.

01:16:14.203 --> 01:16:16.865
(distant helicopter)

01:16:27.617 --> 01:16:29.551
Let's go.

01:16:47.870 --> 01:16:49.929
(phone rings)

01:16:52.975 --> 01:16:53.999
Reigart.

01:16:54.110 --> 01:16:57.409
(Piquet) Leslie, l'm afraid there's bad news.

01:16:58.347 --> 01:17:03.216
The Bosnian-Serb Fourth Army Patrol
found Lieutenant Burnett near Hac.

01:17:04.854 --> 01:17:08.085
l regret to inform you
that Lieutenant Burnett is...

01:17:08.824 --> 01:17:09.916
dead.

01:17:10.026 --> 01:17:13.018
- l am sorry, Leslie.
- Thank you.

01:17:23.172 --> 01:17:27.233
There's meant to be a peace deal.
Hac was meant to be a safe haven.

01:17:27.343 --> 01:17:30.642
Yet once again in Bosnia,
that's proved an illusion.

01:17:30.746 --> 01:17:33.544
And in the midst of fighting
around the southern enclave,

01:17:33.649 --> 01:17:36.083
Bosnian Serb forces announced they'd found

01:17:36.185 --> 01:17:39.848
the body of the American navigator,
Lieutenant Chris Burnett,

01:17:39.955 --> 01:17:42.719
whose plane was shot down two days ago.

01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:48.924
The Serb authorities are claiming
he was shot by Muslim guerrillas,

01:17:49.031 --> 01:17:52.694
opposed to the recently signed
Cincinnati Peace Accord.

01:17:53.969 --> 01:17:57.461
(CNN reporter) The Serbs say the body
was discovered by one of their teams

01:17:57.573 --> 01:18:02.272
in a search-and-rescue attempt
since the F-18 was shot down two days ago.

01:18:02.378 --> 01:18:06.405
This incident is bound to spoil NATO's hopes
for a clean exit from the Balkans,

01:18:06.515 --> 01:18:11.817
and frustrates US military leaders, only days
away from a withdrawal from Bosnia.

01:18:12.121 --> 01:18:15.750
(Sky reporter) For NATO's forces
on the eve of their departure,

01:18:15.858 --> 01:18:19.988
the news ofLieutenant Burnett's death
comes as another dark blow

01:18:20.096 --> 01:18:25.728
at the end ofa disturbing and ultimately
unsuccessful chapter in the alliance's history.

01:18:32.475 --> 01:18:34.966
Savior Six, Savior Six
from Gold Eagle command.

01:18:35.077 --> 01:18:37.375
Be advised the package is not in position.

01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:41.678

Return to base immediately.

01:18:51.293 --> 01:18:53.193
Hey!

01:18:53.295 --> 01:18:55.456
Hey! Wait!

01:19:05.708 --> 01:19:07.676
We're here!

01:19:08.477 --> 01:19:11.969
Come on! Fuck! Damn it!

01:19:12.348 --> 01:19:14.407
We're right here!

01:19:15.084 --> 01:19:17.450
You've gotta be shitting me!

01:19:29.432 --> 01:19:32.128
Son of a bitch!
They killed him, and we did nothing!

01:19:32.234 --> 01:19:34.498
- Captain...
- We did nothing!

01:19:36.739 --> 01:19:38.070
We did nothing.

01:20:03.833 --> 01:20:05.892
We were right here.

01:20:06.335 --> 01:20:08.462
We were right... Fuck!

01:20:12.174 --> 01:20:13.937
What's that?

01:21:09.298 --> 01:21:11.960
lt's not safe here. We'll keep going.

01:21:13.469 --> 01:21:15.437
No. You go.

01:21:22.611 --> 01:21:26.638
They killed my pilot
because we took pictures of the graves.

01:21:26.749 --> 01:21:28.341
And l know where they are.

01:21:28.450 --> 01:21:32.113
And l'm gonna get 'em,
so he didn't die for no reason.

01:21:40.863 --> 01:21:43.024
Don't follow me.

01:21:43.132 --> 01:21:45.100
lt's safer here.

01:24:04.373 --> 01:24:06.034
Shit.

01:24:06.141 --> 01:24:09.076
Goddamn. Why is this off?

01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:13.948
Why is this off? Why is this...?

01:24:36.505 --> 01:24:38.837
(bird squawking)

01:24:45.047 --> 01:24:47.015
Come on.

01:24:48.617 --> 01:24:51.051
Come on! Goddammit!

01:24:54.723 --> 01:24:57.783
All right. OK. OK, come on. Come on.

01:24:58.727 --> 01:25:01.161
Yeah! Yeah. Yeah.

01:25:09.271 --> 01:25:13.367
(PA) For the information of all hands,
this ship will be relieved on station.

01:25:13.475 --> 01:25:18.242
lt will set course for home base,
effective 2300 this evening.

01:25:32.961 --> 01:25:37.398
- Sir? Your presence is requested in the SClF.
- All right, thank you.

01:25:37.499 --> 01:25:39.160
(beeping)

01:25:39.268 --> 01:25:42.237
lt's the homing beacon, sir.
On the second ejection seat.

01:25:42.337 --> 01:25:45.363
The only way to reactivate it
is from the seat, manually.

01:25:45.641 --> 01:25:48.109
- How long has that been on?
- Seven minutes.

01:25:48.410 --> 01:25:53.347
Sir, you've gotta be very familiar
with our systems to reactivate that beacon.

01:25:53.448 --> 01:25:55.939
- That's Burnett.
- Sir, it could be a setup.

01:25:56.051 --> 01:25:59.817
lt's a radio transmission.
They are hearing the same music.

01:25:59.922 --> 01:26:02.049
Sir, l agree.

01:26:02.891 --> 01:26:07.260
Sir, we really should notify NATO command,
or at least contact Donnelly for clearance.

01:26:07.362 --> 01:26:12.891
- Of course, that will take a lot of time.
- Tom, l get it. We wait, Burnett dies.

01:26:13.001 --> 01:26:16.493
Piquet was very clear with his objections, sir.

01:26:16.738 --> 01:26:18.968
- You will lose your command for this.
- So be it.

01:26:19.074 --> 01:26:23.875
l'm not gonna let that kid die out there
while we sit around on this ship!

01:27:54.503 --> 01:27:57.336
OK. All right. OK.

01:28:00.475 --> 01:28:02.466
OK, all right.

01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:06.742
Goddamn!

01:28:15.324 --> 01:28:17.155
(explosion in distance)

01:28:40.449 --> 01:28:42.417
Gentlemen,

01:28:42.985 --> 01:28:46.011
l wanna make one thing clear before we leave.

01:28:47.489 --> 01:28:50.117
l intend to put you in harm's way.

01:28:51.426 --> 01:28:56.625
Any man who doesn't wish to join
this mission, step away right now.

01:29:06.908 --> 01:29:09.570
All right, then.
Let's go get our boy back.

01:31:24.312 --> 01:31:28.009
About two clicks up this valley,
we're gonna make a hard right.

01:31:28.884 --> 01:31:31.250
(helicopters approaching)

01:32:30.946 --> 01:32:33.039
(beeping)

01:32:53.735 --> 01:32:54.759
(yells)

01:32:58.373 --> 01:32:59.738
Argh!

01:33:14.155 --> 01:33:16.680
Argh...

01:33:20.128 --> 01:33:22.653
(rumbling)

01:33:35.744 --> 01:33:38.212
(shouting in Serbo-Croatian)

01:33:52.961 --> 01:33:54.929
(Reigart) There he is. There he is!

01:34:13.048 --> 01:34:16.279
Come on! Come on!
Damn it! What the hell is he waiting for?

01:34:21.690 --> 01:34:23.817
Come on!

01:34:32.834 --> 01:34:34.825
Come on! Come on, kid!

01:34:40.909 --> 01:34:44.345
lt's too hot to set down.
We'll have to cover him aloft.

01:35:09.270 --> 01:35:10.897
Goddammit!

01:35:23.284 --> 01:35:24.842
Come on!

01:35:24.953 --> 01:35:26.113
OK.

01:35:46.808 --> 01:35:47.797
Go!

01:35:47.909 --> 01:35:50.571
Captain, fast rope. Go get him.

01:35:50.678 --> 01:35:52.873
Sir, he's on the rope.

01:36:01.856 --> 01:36:04.757
- Sniper in the open.
- We'll take him.

01:36:06.194 --> 01:36:07.923
Come on, son. Come on!

01:36:14.369 --> 01:36:15.666
Go!

01:36:33.888 --> 01:36:36.448
They got him! Pull up! Pull up!

01:37:08.957 --> 01:37:11.016
Hey, Chris.

01:37:11.125 --> 01:37:13.093
Hey, Glen.

01:37:13.595 --> 01:37:14.562
Admiral.

01:37:20.635 --> 01:37:23.126
This is why they killed Stackhouse.

01:37:31.679 --> 01:37:33.476
Admiral?

01:37:33.581 --> 01:37:37.745
You were holding a letter for me.
l'd like to get it back.

01:37:38.486 --> 01:37:40.511
l think l can find it.

01:37:57.605 --> 01:38:00.403
( ''The Rescue Blues '' by Ryan Adams)

01:38:19.227 --> 01:38:22.924
And everybody wants to see you suffer

01:38:26.234 --> 01:38:29.829
They know that you need the pain so much

01:38:33.341 --> 01:38:39.439
They throw you up a rope
when you're too high to cruise, baby...

01:38:40.114 --> 01:38:42.947
Lord, you lose, lady

01:38:44.619 --> 01:38:48.055
Then they charge you with the rescue blues

01:38:52.961 --> 01:38:55.953
The rescue blues

01:39:05.373 --> 01:39:08.604
And everybody wants to see you fall

01:39:12.313 --> 01:39:16.579
That's why they always love
to get you high, high

01:39:19.454 --> 01:39:25.051
And everybody knows
you need the pain so much, lady

01:39:26.060 --> 01:39:28.255
Keep in touch, baby

01:39:30.331 --> 01:39:34.392
Just don't charge me
with your rescue blues

01:39:35.036 --> 01:39:37.698
Oh, oh

01:39:38.906 --> 01:39:41.431
Rescue blues
