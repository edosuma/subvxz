WEBVTT

02:37.658 --> 02:39.284
<i>Yes, yes. How's it looking?</i>

02:39.284 --> 02:41.411
Oh, my God!

02:41.995 --> 02:44.831
It is here, bruv.

02:44.831 --> 02:46.416
This is insane.

02:46.416 --> 02:50.045
I can't believe
this is actually happening. Yes.

02:50.045 --> 02:52.047
<i>- What's it saying?</i>
- Oh, bruv, it's beautiful.

02:52.047 --> 02:54.424
<i>Dude, how many months
of selling underwear did you have to do</i>

02:54.424 --> 02:56.385
<i>to afford the new wheel? Be honest.</i>

02:56.385 --> 02:59.346
<i>I just know this means
you'll be at the gaming cafe less.</i>

02:59.346 --> 03:02.182
Yeah, bruv, I'm bored of the cafe.

03:02.182 --> 03:05.352
Yo, I'm 99% sure
that I've beaten every single person

03:05.352 --> 03:07.604
that's ever stepped foot in the cafe.

03:07.604 --> 03:10.732
Also, for your information,

03:10.732 --> 03:13.652
it only took me a month
of saving up at the knickers store

03:13.652 --> 03:14.862
to afford the new wheel.

03:14.862 --> 03:18.073
Not months, plural. Month, singular.

03:18.073 --> 03:19.741
Moment of truth.

03:20.242 --> 03:21.285
Oh, she's perfect.

03:23.245 --> 03:25.414
This is so much better than my old setup.

03:25.414 --> 03:28.292
I'm sorry, I'm unstoppable now.
I'm unstoppable.

03:28.292 --> 03:31.044
<i>All right, Big Dog.
I'm looking at Rory right now</i>

03:31.044 --> 03:32.880
<i>and he says to meet in the lobby.</i>

03:32.880 --> 03:34.381
<i>Race Le Mans. Yeah?</i>

03:35.174 --> 03:36.842
Fine. I'll play Rory.

03:36.842 --> 03:38.677
- Jann.
- But tell him to bring his own coffin.

03:38.677 --> 03:39.595
Jann.

03:40.179 --> 03:41.597
Hey. Sorry, Dad.

03:41.597 --> 03:42.973
We're headed to the field.

03:42.973 --> 03:45.267
You wanna get outside
and kick it around a bit?

03:45.267 --> 03:47.311
Get some air? It'll do you good.

03:49.438 --> 03:50.689
No, I'm okay.

03:51.481 --> 03:53.817
Sooner or later you're gonna have
to leave this room, right?

03:54.651 --> 03:56.820
Dad! Come on, let's go!

03:58.655 --> 04:00.282
You could learn from your younger brother.

04:00.282 --> 04:02.993
If you'd practice football half as much
as you play this damn game--

04:02.993 --> 04:06.330
I don't like football, Dad.
We've been over this.

04:10.459 --> 04:12.085
'Sup, man, you still there?

04:12.836 --> 04:13.837
<i>Yeah.</i>

04:13.837 --> 04:16.964
<i>Jeez, your dad's not into your lifestyle,
my bro.</i>

04:17.548 --> 04:19.510
God, yeah, no shit.

04:22.679 --> 04:25.599
Bruv, I'm just gonna do
a quick custom job.

04:27.768 --> 04:28.936
<i>Where'd you go?</i>

04:29.520 --> 04:30.812
<i>Janny.</i>

04:36.068 --> 04:37.653
<i>Janny, where'd you go?</i>

04:37.653 --> 04:40.948
Sorry, I'm just adjusting the rear wing.

04:40.948 --> 04:44.326
Giving it more downforce. More rake.

04:44.326 --> 04:46.161
<i>Janny, Rory's waiting.</i>

04:46.161 --> 04:48.789
Sorry, this car is ridiculous.

04:48.789 --> 04:51.959
At this point this is actually a waste
of my time, but you know what?

04:51.959 --> 04:54.670
Go on, I'll play Rory. Why not?

04:54.670 --> 04:58.215
<i>- The anticipation is killing me, bruv.</i>
- I'm loading him into the Le Mans race.

04:58.215 --> 04:59.132
Okay.

05:00.968 --> 05:03.053
- Ready.
<i>- Go, Speed Racer.</i>

05:04.888 --> 05:06.014
Let's go.

05:42.467 --> 05:43.594
Hi. Good to see you again.

05:56.773 --> 05:58.233
<i>How may I help you, sir?</i>

05:58.233 --> 06:02.654
I'm Danny Moore with Marketing.
I have a meeting with Motorsports.

06:02.654 --> 06:06.742
- Yes. Perfect. Here is your pass, sir.
- Thank you so much.

06:11.496 --> 06:14.541
Well, thank you again for having me.

06:16.668 --> 06:19.630
This is Yamauchi Kazunori,

06:19.630 --> 06:22.216
creator of <i>Gran Turismo,</i>

06:22.216 --> 06:25.302
a racing game so accurate...

06:26.053 --> 06:31.266
it's inspired a love of driving
in 80 million players.

06:33.936 --> 06:35.646
The realism, the physics,

06:35.646 --> 06:37.481
the fidelity of the cars.

06:37.481 --> 06:40.692
And recreated
the world's most famous racetracks

06:40.692 --> 06:42.778
with meticulous attention to detail.

06:42.778 --> 06:46.573
They test these cars over and over again.

06:46.573 --> 06:48.575
All of this comes together

06:48.575 --> 06:52.037
to give the player
the most realistic driving experience.

06:53.997 --> 06:55.457
So when I came to Nissan...

06:56.250 --> 06:58.085
my job was...

06:58.085 --> 07:01.922
to call people who defaulted
on their car payments.

07:04.424 --> 07:07.052
Most of them said,
"Go ahead, take it. I don't want it."

07:08.220 --> 07:10.514
They'd rather be on their phones
in the back of an Uber

07:10.514 --> 07:12.015
than driving themselves.

07:12.015 --> 07:16.311
Car buyers today don't dream
of the open road.

07:16.311 --> 07:19.606
They don't associate their cars
with adventure.

07:21.066 --> 07:22.901
But <i>Gran Turismo</i> players do.

07:23.652 --> 07:28.073
This is an untapped demographic of buyers

07:28.991 --> 07:30.826
that we should be reaching.

07:32.870 --> 07:34.997
And how do you suggest we do that?

07:35.622 --> 07:37.291
By creating a contest

07:37.291 --> 07:41.753
that offers the best video game players
in the world a chance

07:41.753 --> 07:44.256
to compete in professional racing.

07:45.549 --> 07:47.301
If we can take one driver

07:47.301 --> 07:50.137
from the virtual world,
from behind their console,

07:50.137 --> 07:55.309
and put them into a race car, onto a track
and turn them into a champion...

07:59.271 --> 08:02.024
Nissan will reignite the dream to drive

08:02.024 --> 08:05.194
in 80 million others.

08:12.993 --> 08:13.994
Thank you.

08:21.793 --> 08:22.961
Mr. Moore.

08:24.505 --> 08:26.089
You left these upstairs.

08:27.799 --> 08:32.888
You really believe
one of these players could compete.

08:34.597 --> 08:37.433
I do. Absolutely, yeah.

08:38.434 --> 08:41.938
I've played the game
and it's remarkable, actually.

08:42.606 --> 08:46.818
You understand if we put them in our cars
and somebody was hurt,

08:46.818 --> 08:48.779
we would all be responsible.

08:49.279 --> 08:51.490
Yes, I understand. Yes. Yeah.

08:51.490 --> 08:56.036
The board has agreed to move forward
with your program under one condition.

08:56.036 --> 08:59.289
You find a certified chief engineer
to ensure that it's safe.

08:59.289 --> 09:01.500
There can be no mistakes.

09:02.793 --> 09:05.295
Absolutely. Of course.

09:05.921 --> 09:06.922
I wish you luck.

09:08.715 --> 09:09.716
Thank you.

09:12.427 --> 09:13.762
Holy shit.

09:14.388 --> 09:18.725
<i>Yeah, of course I understand.
It is. It's a very steep learning curve.</i>

09:18.725 --> 09:21.436
But with the right instructor,
you know, like you...

09:24.106 --> 09:25.107
Yeah.

09:25.732 --> 09:26.733
Yeah, I do.

09:29.903 --> 09:31.738
Thank you again for your time.

09:47.588 --> 09:48.797
Holy shit.

09:49.381 --> 09:51.425
Jack Salter.

10:38.764 --> 10:39.765
Jack.

10:41.266 --> 10:42.267
Jack!

10:45.604 --> 10:46.855
Salter!

10:50.859 --> 10:53.111
Got a visitor. Make it quick.

10:53.111 --> 10:55.113
Capa wants that fixed yesterday.

11:04.623 --> 11:05.958
It's a contest.

11:07.918 --> 11:10.462
The fastest SIM racers in the world...

11:12.005 --> 11:13.257
get to compete in a camp.

11:13.841 --> 11:16.635
And the winner gets to race
for Team Nissan.

11:19.221 --> 11:23.100
Wow. What do you get out of this?
You get a bigger office or something?

11:23.100 --> 11:24.351
I wish.

11:24.351 --> 11:27.396
It's insane. It's not gonna work.
It's far too dangerous.

11:27.396 --> 11:28.313
Why?

11:28.814 --> 11:31.191
You really think
that you're gonna put some kid

11:31.191 --> 11:33.902
who's been playing a game in his bedroom

11:33.902 --> 11:36.780
into a 200-mile-an-hour rocket?

11:36.780 --> 11:38.740
It'll tear him to pieces.

11:39.324 --> 11:41.910
These players have clocked more track time

11:41.910 --> 11:44.538
than you have in your entire career.

11:44.538 --> 11:47.124
On, what do you call it, a console?

11:47.666 --> 11:51.503
You know that if you get in a wreck
out here, you can't hit reset, right?

11:51.503 --> 11:54.047
How many guys you go to
before you went to me?

11:54.047 --> 11:56.049
- A few.
- Yeah. "A few."

11:56.758 --> 11:57.593
A lot.

11:58.677 --> 12:01.305
But nobody
with your particular experience.

12:01.305 --> 12:04.016
Oh, God. Come on, man.

12:04.016 --> 12:07.102
I haven't been chief engineer in 15 years.

12:09.771 --> 12:12.691
These kids, they're outsiders too.

12:13.525 --> 12:17.154
I know it's unprecedented,
but so was a kid from Iowa racing Le Mans.

12:18.071 --> 12:20.657
Yeah. Look how that turned out.

12:22.242 --> 12:25.412
Don't you wanna take racing back
from these pricks

12:25.412 --> 12:27.039
who think they can just buy it?

12:29.291 --> 12:32.669
I'm talking about a chance
to compete again.

12:32.669 --> 12:34.838
Don't you want one last shot?

12:37.799 --> 12:39.927
I think
those days are in my rearview, friend.

12:39.927 --> 12:41.887
Then what are you doing here?

12:42.471 --> 12:44.640
Somewhere out there, there's a kid

12:44.640 --> 12:48.101
who's faster than all these assholes...

12:49.311 --> 12:52.981
that's just never gotten a chance
to show the world what they're capable of.

12:52.981 --> 12:54.983
I'm gonna find them!

12:54.983 --> 12:56.318
Yeah, cool.

13:21.009 --> 13:21.844
Here we go.

13:21.844 --> 13:23.762
Oh, yum, get excited.

13:23.762 --> 13:26.557
Lentil salad. My favorite.

13:26.557 --> 13:30.227
- No sarcasm at the table, please.
- No having fun at the table, please.

13:30.227 --> 13:33.689
You're a dedicated athlete.
Diet matters. Yeah? Eat up.

13:33.689 --> 13:36.191
You're starting on the wing tomorrow.
Plenty of eyes on you.

13:38.986 --> 13:40.737
Sorry. I'm sorry.

13:42.698 --> 13:45.742
When I go pro,
I'll eat at a steakhouse every night.

13:46.243 --> 13:47.452
You'll be there too, Jann.

13:48.036 --> 13:49.538
You could be our waiter.

13:50.122 --> 13:51.123
Very funny.

13:51.123 --> 13:54.042
But I'm not gonna be a waiter.
I've got plans.

13:54.626 --> 13:57.296
Says the dude who sells stockings
at the department store.

13:57.296 --> 13:58.881
- Coby.
- Coby, that's enough.

13:58.881 --> 14:00.799
- On a roll tonight.
- Okay.

14:01.675 --> 14:04.011
Have you thought at all
about going back to university?

14:04.011 --> 14:06.430
Mum, we've been over this so many times.

14:06.430 --> 14:09.349
Motorsports Engineering is a step
in that direction.

14:09.349 --> 14:12.561
And I told you, at university,
they didn't let us drive the cars.

14:13.478 --> 14:15.272
Not again about the race cars.

14:15.272 --> 14:18.150
Didn't you say
"Always do something you love"?

14:18.984 --> 14:24.323
Yes. Yes. I did,
but I meant within the realm of reality.

14:24.323 --> 14:27.784
I played grassroots football for years
before my first professional contract.

14:27.784 --> 14:31.914
Well, I can start at the bottom.
Work in the pits. Do car maintenance.

14:31.914 --> 14:34.124
Yeah, but that's not our world, son.

14:35.501 --> 14:38.462
- You know what racing cars cost?
- It's what I love.

14:40.088 --> 14:41.173
It's what I'm good at.

14:45.177 --> 14:47.888
These lentils are quite nice.

14:49.556 --> 14:50.807
I'm not hungry.

15:09.868 --> 15:12.454
Throughout my life,
I've invested in talent

15:12.454 --> 15:14.915
that guarantees me
a front-row seat to greatness,

15:14.915 --> 15:17.709
and this is what we endeavor towards
this season.

15:19.127 --> 15:20.295
To be elite.

15:21.922 --> 15:26.385
No? Nicky, my boy,
last year we had a rough start.

15:26.385 --> 15:27.803
But this year,

15:27.803 --> 15:32.099
everything from the cars to the team
will be best in class.

15:32.099 --> 15:34.393
This year will be our greatest.

15:34.393 --> 15:35.519
Hear, hear.

15:36.728 --> 15:39.690
This season is going to be great,
but it comes down to dedication.

15:40.607 --> 15:41.441
Talent.

15:42.985 --> 15:46.989
So no messing around. I'll demand
as much from you as I do of myself,

15:46.989 --> 15:49.241
so make sure you keep up or you're gone.

15:49.241 --> 15:52.160
Nick, you looked good out there today.

15:54.496 --> 15:56.039
You have something to say?

15:56.039 --> 16:00.252
You're not carrying enough speed
into turn four.

16:02.171 --> 16:04.923
You know that, right? You're braking early
and you should push it.

16:04.923 --> 16:07.676
Oh, you're giving me advice right now?

16:13.432 --> 16:15.225
You're a good driver, Nick.

16:15.225 --> 16:17.769
I don't know how many times
you need to hear that.

16:17.769 --> 16:21.148
But you get a little emotional.
And when you get emotional--

16:26.236 --> 16:27.321
You're a mechanic.

16:28.238 --> 16:31.617
If I want driving advice,
I'll talk to my team leader.

16:32.242 --> 16:35.245
Not some flamed-out has-been
who couldn't back it up 50 years ago.

16:40.667 --> 16:44.254
<i>Hello, you've reached the voicemail
of Danny Moore. Leave a message.</i>

16:44.254 --> 16:46.048
Tell Nissan I'll do it.

16:46.048 --> 16:48.842
I'm not spending another minute
with this pretentious clown show.

16:48.842 --> 16:50.969
I'll teach your gamer kids how to drive.

16:50.969 --> 16:53.347
They just gotta prove to me
that they can do it.

16:54.389 --> 16:56.767
If I feel like it's unsafe,
I'm gonna walk.

16:56.767 --> 16:58.852
Not gonna have blood on my hands.

17:03.148 --> 17:04.441
How we doing, gamers?

17:08.194 --> 17:10.864
My favorite sound in the world.
Sound of clicking. How we doing, brother?

17:11.448 --> 17:13.282
Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

17:17.329 --> 17:18.622
Excuse me.

17:18.622 --> 17:21.124
- Can I get your help here, please?
- Yes. Of course you can.

17:22.709 --> 17:23.544
Hey.

17:26.380 --> 17:28.632
You are joking.

17:29.258 --> 17:32.845
Bruv, you gotta see this.

17:37.266 --> 17:39.059
Dude, I've only got a minute. What's up?

17:52.990 --> 17:53.907
Dude.

17:57.494 --> 18:00.122
- What is this?
- I saw this message on the screen.

18:00.122 --> 18:02.374
It says that the account
that was last logged in on this console

18:02.374 --> 18:04.585
got one of the fastest lap times
in the UK.

18:04.585 --> 18:05.794
Dude, it was your account.

18:05.794 --> 18:08.547
- Wait, this is a joke.
- No. It's a contest.

18:12.050 --> 18:13.051
Press play, dude.

18:14.928 --> 18:18.640
<i>If you're one of the very, very few people
getting this message,</i>

18:18.640 --> 18:23.562
<i>it means that you set
the fastest lap time in</i> Gran Turismo.

18:23.562 --> 18:27.065
<i>There's a virtual race happening tomorrow.</i>

18:27.065 --> 18:30.527
<i>Win it and a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity awaits you.</i>

18:30.527 --> 18:32.613
<i>We've created an academy</i>

18:32.613 --> 18:35.782
<i>to take the best SIM racers in the world</i>

18:35.782 --> 18:38.702
<i>and train them to race real race cars.</i>

18:38.702 --> 18:43.707
<i>We want to prove to the whole world
that the impossible dream can happen.</i>

18:46.710 --> 18:47.711
Dude, this is real?

18:47.711 --> 18:50.506
It's as real as a ten-car pileup
on the M4. Bad example.

18:50.506 --> 18:52.424
You need to practice now.

19:05.312 --> 19:08.649
- Why don't you follow the race line?
- Just experimenting.

19:11.151 --> 19:13.820
See, the other drivers,
they follow that line.

19:13.820 --> 19:17.533
So if I go wide like this,

19:18.617 --> 19:20.410
sometimes I beat them.

19:20.410 --> 19:21.495
Like that.

19:23.664 --> 19:25.582
And if it doesn't work, I just reset.

19:25.582 --> 19:26.917
Night-night, son.

19:26.917 --> 19:28.001
Night, Dad.

19:29.086 --> 19:32.005
<i>If you're getting this message,
it means that you're one</i>

19:32.005 --> 19:35.968
<i>of the best</i> Gran Turismo <i>players
in the world right now.</i>

19:36.844 --> 19:37.719
What?

19:38.637 --> 19:39.888
Looking at porn?

19:39.888 --> 19:41.640
- No. I'm not.
- Liar.

19:42.140 --> 19:44.768
Come on.
We're throwing a party at the pier.

19:44.768 --> 19:46.144
Dude, you took the keys?

19:47.938 --> 19:50.941
Coby, you're on your last strike.
Mum will kill you if you get in trouble.

19:50.941 --> 19:52.776
That's why we're using your window.

19:53.402 --> 19:56.029
Sorry, man. I've gotta practice.

19:58.323 --> 19:59.867
I heard Audrey will be there.

20:02.369 --> 20:03.370
Come on.

20:14.756 --> 20:16.341
Coby, give me the keys.

20:16.341 --> 20:17.426
Nope.

20:18.385 --> 20:19.720
Let me drive.

20:19.720 --> 20:21.263
I'm a better driver, bruv.

20:21.263 --> 20:25.100
This is bullshit, Coby.
I can't believe I'm letting you drive.

20:25.100 --> 20:27.811
I can't believe I invited you.
Get in, Jann.

20:27.811 --> 20:29.897
You better not screw up Dad's car.

20:32.191 --> 20:34.860
Drop the clutch.
I thought you could drive.

20:38.572 --> 20:39.656
Cheers, bruv.

20:40.782 --> 20:42.743
Simulate me, Janny!

20:47.956 --> 20:49.166
Hey.

20:49.958 --> 20:50.792
Hey.

20:51.418 --> 20:53.003
You having fun over here?

20:54.838 --> 20:58.509
Yeah, I was coming over in a sec.

20:58.509 --> 20:59.593
Yeah?

20:59.593 --> 21:01.929
We were just talking about traveling.

21:02.679 --> 21:04.139
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

21:04.723 --> 21:06.391
I don't know, do you ever just...

21:06.391 --> 21:10.479
wanna pack a bag
and leave here and never look back?

21:11.355 --> 21:12.397
All the time.

21:12.397 --> 21:13.690
- Yeah?
- Yes.

21:14.691 --> 21:15.692
Me too.

21:18.195 --> 21:21.323
You know, if there was one place
in the world that I could go,

21:21.323 --> 21:23.659
I think it would be New York.

21:23.659 --> 21:24.993
Why?

21:24.993 --> 21:26.995
I've heard they have good pizza.

21:26.995 --> 21:29.164
Yes. I've heard that too.

21:29.164 --> 21:30.666
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.001
What about you?

21:35.379 --> 21:36.588
This is stressful.

21:38.799 --> 21:41.426
Gun to your head, what's one place
you wanna go before you die?

21:41.426 --> 21:42.928
Tokyo. Done.

21:43.512 --> 21:45.514
- Okay. Tokyo.
- Tokyo.

21:46.640 --> 21:50.310
Is that because of the guy
who created your game?

21:50.310 --> 21:54.439
Yes, but technically it's not a game.

21:56.233 --> 21:58.569
I mean,
technically it's a racing simulator.

21:58.569 --> 22:00.612
Right. Okay.

22:03.031 --> 22:04.032
Sorry.

22:05.367 --> 22:08.036
What is it about racing
that you love so much?

22:08.036 --> 22:09.288
Well...

22:10.789 --> 22:13.917
Sometimes when I'm driving,

22:13.917 --> 22:16.670
I can be going so fast,

22:17.337 --> 22:21.133
and everything else is moving so slow,

22:21.133 --> 22:25.470
and it's like the rest of the world
just falls away.

22:25.470 --> 22:28.307
It's just you and the car...

22:29.558 --> 22:30.809
and that's it.

22:30.809 --> 22:32.269
It's kind of magic.

22:32.269 --> 22:33.187
Magic.

22:34.688 --> 22:36.064
Put out the fire!

22:36.064 --> 22:37.316
Put it out!

22:38.984 --> 22:42.112
- I should probably get going.
- Yeah.

22:42.112 --> 22:43.530
My train leaves early.

22:45.115 --> 22:47.826
I bet Brighton is better than here.

22:48.619 --> 22:50.871
Yes. It is.

22:52.372 --> 22:55.584
DM me sometime, Jann.
I'll be watching for you.

22:55.584 --> 22:58.045
Good luck with the simulating.

22:59.630 --> 23:01.423
- Bye.
- Thank you. Bye.

23:01.423 --> 23:02.841
Audrey, let's go!

23:06.929 --> 23:08.305
Oh, come on!

23:08.305 --> 23:10.516
You drive slower
than my grandmother! Let's go!

23:11.433 --> 23:13.977
Yeah, well, there's a reason
that I'm driving.

23:13.977 --> 23:15.479
I'm the sober one. Chill.

23:15.479 --> 23:17.439
Let's see if these guys got a beer for me.

23:17.439 --> 23:19.775
Hey!

23:21.068 --> 23:22.277
You got more beers there?

23:22.277 --> 23:25.447
Are you still thirsty, mate? I got you!

23:26.031 --> 23:28.116
Couple o' pints on me!

23:32.704 --> 23:34.289
You are kidding me.

23:34.289 --> 23:36.291
Oh, sit down. Stop.

23:36.291 --> 23:38.544
I'm done. Like, finished!

23:39.044 --> 23:40.879
The uni captain will pull my scholarship--

23:40.879 --> 23:42.005
Yo, shut up, shut up.

23:42.005 --> 23:43.340
Shush, shush, shush.

23:44.424 --> 23:46.969
All right, belts on. Get your belt on.

23:50.013 --> 23:51.890
My football career's over.

23:51.890 --> 23:53.600
What are we gonna do?

23:54.935 --> 23:56.645
We'll spend the night in jail
if they catch us now.

23:56.645 --> 23:57.563
Jail?

23:57.563 --> 24:00.190
No, what? No, we can't.

24:00.190 --> 24:01.108
Shut up!

24:03.861 --> 24:05.946
They're pulling them over, not us.

24:07.364 --> 24:09.366
I'm not missing my race tomorrow.

24:13.954 --> 24:15.747
What the bloody hell are you doing?

24:22.629 --> 24:24.298
Oh, Jesus Christ!

24:26.049 --> 24:28.427
- I'm gonna puke.
- Yo, don't puke in my dad's car.

24:39.104 --> 24:40.230
Jann!

24:54.203 --> 24:55.913
Be chill, be chill, be chill.

25:02.127 --> 25:03.128
Have they gone?

25:07.799 --> 25:09.676
Yes, we're not going to jail!

25:20.229 --> 25:23.982
Bollocks. Oh, man.
He'll know I was drinking if you drove.

25:23.982 --> 25:26.193
- He could tell my coach.
- He's not telling him nothing.

25:26.193 --> 25:28.946
He wants you on the team
more than you wanna be on the team.

25:31.406 --> 25:33.700
Okay, say I'm the better driver
and I'll take the blame.

25:34.284 --> 25:37.496
Say I'm the better driver
and I'll take the blame. Say it.

25:37.496 --> 25:39.790
- Say I'm the better driver. Say it.
- You're the better driver.

25:46.713 --> 25:49.675
We couple the lead engine
with the cars, yeah?

25:49.675 --> 25:51.510
- Yes.
- Connect the rod.

25:52.553 --> 25:53.679
The pneumatics.

25:53.679 --> 25:54.638
Yep.

25:56.098 --> 25:57.391
Release.

25:58.934 --> 26:01.937
What's up? You in a hurry?
You got someplace to be?

26:02.563 --> 26:04.982
- Sorry. No.
- Yeah. Bring that up.

26:05.774 --> 26:07.401
Dad, obviously I'm happy to pay

26:07.401 --> 26:10.988
for the damage to the mirror
and the paintwork and stuff,

26:10.988 --> 26:16.451
but I was just wondering how many
of these sessions I have to do. You know?

26:16.451 --> 26:18.495
You think that's why you're here?

26:18.495 --> 26:19.830
Is it not?

26:21.290 --> 26:24.126
You're not here
because you broke the mirror on the car,

26:24.126 --> 26:26.253
or because you took it without asking me.

26:26.920 --> 26:28.505
Then why am I here?

26:28.505 --> 26:33.177
Because this is where you end up
when you don't have a plan.

26:34.803 --> 26:35.804
I'm sorry, wait.

26:37.973 --> 26:40.350
Am I here because I play <i>Gran Turismo?</i>

26:40.350 --> 26:43.061
You think you're gonna play
stupid video games about cars

26:43.061 --> 26:45.189
and you're gonna become a race car driver?

26:46.273 --> 26:49.443
Either you go back to school
and find something achievable,

26:49.985 --> 26:52.112
or you can join me here now.

26:52.112 --> 26:54.281
But there's no future in racing.

26:56.950 --> 26:57.951
I'm done.

27:14.510 --> 27:15.928
Pick up, pick up.

27:15.928 --> 27:17.930
<i>- I'm coming.</i>
- Dude, the race starts in two minutes.

27:17.930 --> 27:19.348
I need you to sign me in.

27:19.348 --> 27:21.558
<i>I have signed you in, but it's
a rolling start. I can't control it.</i>

27:21.558 --> 27:23.393
If I'm not there when the lights go green,
start the race.

27:23.393 --> 27:25.479
No. What? That's illegal, I can't do that.

27:25.479 --> 27:28.315
<i>- It's gotta be you that drives.</i>
- If I don't get this, I'm done.

27:28.315 --> 27:32.611
<i>We are moments away from the start
of the European qualifying race.</i>

27:32.611 --> 27:36.156
Come on, come on, come on.
Bruv, it's starting. It's starting!

27:36.156 --> 27:38.242
<i>Best of luck to all you gamers out there.</i>

27:38.242 --> 27:39.243
Go, go, go!

27:39.243 --> 27:42.579
<i>Three, two, one...</i>

27:42.579 --> 27:43.872
<i>And we're off!</i>

27:45.207 --> 27:47.584
- Can you catch up?
- I think so.

27:48.460 --> 27:51.964
- Persol, how many am I up against?
- It is you against the 19 best in Europe.

27:54.800 --> 27:59.096
Okay, bro, you're in 17th position,
but you got ten laps to come back.

27:59.096 --> 28:01.390
We need a win
to go to GT Academy. Come on.

28:03.934 --> 28:05.811
Loosey-goosey, baby. Loosey-goosey.

28:09.189 --> 28:12.109
He's boxing you out.
You gotta do something.

28:12.818 --> 28:14.027
Time's running out.

28:24.496 --> 28:27.165
I'm taking the outside.
There's no time to dance.

28:49.813 --> 28:51.648
Yes, Jann. That's my boy.

28:52.524 --> 28:54.067
Two seconds back from the next car.

28:58.155 --> 28:59.698
This is it. Last lap, you gotta go.

29:02.409 --> 29:03.744
Come on, Jann!

29:03.744 --> 29:06.496
- Okay, second position just spun out.
- Oh, shit!

29:09.333 --> 29:10.834
I'm six seconds behind the leader.

29:12.169 --> 29:13.253
Final turn now.

29:13.253 --> 29:14.463
Come on, Jann.

29:14.463 --> 29:15.547
Push it!

29:18.425 --> 29:19.760
Yes. Yes. Yes.

29:20.511 --> 29:22.054
That's him, that's him. There he is.

29:43.158 --> 29:46.370
<i>You'll let him walk out
without knowing who's operating this camp?</i>

29:46.370 --> 29:48.914
He's only off to Northampton.

29:48.914 --> 29:52.626
He's off to race cars. Do you have
any idea how dangerous that is?

29:52.626 --> 29:55.963
Dad, I'm sorry, you're the one that said,
"Go and do something real."

29:55.963 --> 29:58.549
Now I am, and it's too dangerous.
Make up your mind.

29:58.549 --> 30:01.176
Look, this has never
been done before, Jann.

30:01.176 --> 30:03.470
It's a gimmick.
You've barely driven a real car.

30:03.470 --> 30:05.764
Dad, I've raced thousands of hours.

30:05.764 --> 30:07.891
But it's not the same, son.

30:09.810 --> 30:12.354
Real drivers,
they're professional athletes. Not like--

30:14.565 --> 30:15.941
Dad, do you remember this day?

30:16.900 --> 30:19.444
You took this of me when I was 5.

30:20.237 --> 30:23.782
All I've wanted to do since then
is be a racer.

30:28.704 --> 30:29.913
I am doing it.

30:32.749 --> 30:34.376
Whether you believe in me or not.

30:44.469 --> 30:47.014
<i>Welcome to the GT Academy.</i>

30:53.520 --> 30:54.980
Hi.

30:58.317 --> 30:59.484
<i>The ten of you...</i>

31:01.653 --> 31:04.448
<i>hailing from eight different countries,</i>

31:04.448 --> 31:07.409
<i>are the best SIM racers</i>

31:08.327 --> 31:09.870
<i>in the world.</i>

31:12.831 --> 31:15.334
<i>You've overcome incredible odds
to be here.</i>

31:16.460 --> 31:18.253
<i>Now you stand on this track...</i>

31:19.421 --> 31:22.341
<i>with enormous opportunity.</i>

31:22.341 --> 31:25.719
<i>The winner will earn a seat</i>

31:25.719 --> 31:27.679
<i>on Team Nissan...</i>

31:30.224 --> 31:33.894
and a place in racing history.

31:35.312 --> 31:39.149
Now, please meet our chief engineer,

31:39.149 --> 31:42.402
the man who's gonna teach you all
how to do it, Jack Salter.

31:42.402 --> 31:44.029
Dude's a fricking legend.

31:44.029 --> 31:46.698
So all these folks behind me are...

31:47.574 --> 31:51.703
keen on y'all proving
you can do the impossible.

31:52.704 --> 31:54.790
I'm here to prove that you can't.

32:01.880 --> 32:03.674
Hi. What's your name?

32:04.800 --> 32:05.926
Jann Mardenborough.

32:05.926 --> 32:08.220
Jann. Wow, you're tall.

32:08.220 --> 32:09.721
You fit in a race car?

32:10.347 --> 32:11.473
I don't know.

32:12.432 --> 32:15.018
I guess in the game I do.

32:17.938 --> 32:19.356
This is not a game.

32:27.531 --> 32:28.532
Racing.

32:29.116 --> 32:31.910
It takes strength,
it takes tremendous will,

32:33.203 --> 32:35.163
intelligence, sensitivity.

32:35.163 --> 32:38.625
There's only a handful of people
in the entire world

32:38.625 --> 32:41.837
who can do it at the level
that you're gonna be asked to do it.

32:42.588 --> 32:45.883
When you're in a race,
the g-forces will be twice

32:45.883 --> 32:49.720
what an astronaut experiences
upon liftoff.

32:50.345 --> 32:52.890
And it's under these conditions
that you're gonna be forced

32:52.890 --> 32:57.311
to make split-second decisions
that could cost you your life.

32:57.311 --> 32:58.729
Or worse...

32:59.730 --> 33:01.440
you could kill someone else.

33:02.524 --> 33:04.193
These are incredible stakes.

33:04.776 --> 33:07.112
And if you're not willing to risk it,

33:07.112 --> 33:09.323
I want you to walk away.

33:09.990 --> 33:11.992
There's absolutely no shame.

33:12.659 --> 33:16.747
'Cause if you stay, I'm gonna push you
harder than you have ever been pushed,

33:16.747 --> 33:20.334
and I am gonna prove
that you don't have what it takes.

33:20.334 --> 33:23.003
Because to take one look at any of you,

33:24.087 --> 33:26.256
I can already tell that you don't.

33:28.800 --> 33:29.968
Welcome.

33:35.724 --> 33:37.559
Great pep talk, Churchill.

33:37.559 --> 33:39.061
I think they got the point.

33:39.061 --> 33:40.145
Look.

33:41.021 --> 33:42.481
This was my dream.

33:43.690 --> 33:45.150
To take SIM racers,

33:46.276 --> 33:47.736
put them into real cars,

33:48.445 --> 33:51.907
<i>and have them race
against professional drivers.</i>

33:52.616 --> 33:57.037
<i>Now is your chance
to turn dreams into reality.</i>

33:57.037 --> 33:58.163
<i>Let's go!</i>

34:03.919 --> 34:06.421
<i>This is the first time
you've been in a race car,</i>

34:06.421 --> 34:09.967
as opposed to sitting
in front of a computer screen.

34:09.967 --> 34:13.428
There's a lot of similarities
when it comes to throttle, braking.

34:14.179 --> 34:16.514
How to take turns, how to use brakes,

34:16.514 --> 34:17.891
find your line on the track.

34:17.891 --> 34:20.601
I think this is the chance
we've all been looking for,

34:20.601 --> 34:22.688
to become what we wanted to.

34:22.688 --> 34:25.399
You never know how high you can achieve.

34:25.399 --> 34:27.734
- Dreams can come true.
- All right, Jann.

34:27.734 --> 34:29.194
- Jann?
- Yes.

34:29.194 --> 34:32.906
And just remember this whole thing
is about press readiness, okay?

34:32.906 --> 34:35.449
When did you know
that you wanted to be a racer?

34:37.034 --> 34:39.496
Well, I liked cars since I was a kid.

34:43.667 --> 34:45.043
Go, go, go. Come on.

34:45.043 --> 34:47.754
You're going
to compete in different exercises

34:47.754 --> 34:52.301
<i>so that we can determine whose SIM skills
translate to driving a real car.</i>

34:53.719 --> 34:57.097
<i>I wasn't prepared for just how physical</i>

34:57.097 --> 34:58.974
the demands of the car were gonna be.

34:58.974 --> 35:01.602
<i>-What do you think about your competitors?
- They're great.</i>

35:02.227 --> 35:03.270
<i>How about Matty?</i>

35:03.896 --> 35:06.565
To each his own. He's obviously
very confident. Good for him.

35:06.565 --> 35:07.649
What do you think about Jann?

35:07.649 --> 35:11.820
Jann is the same as any other driver
on the track. Just another car to pass.

35:11.820 --> 35:12.946
Matty with the answers.

35:12.946 --> 35:15.073
Better strap in too, man.
We're about to go fast.

35:15.073 --> 35:16.158
Let's see it.

35:17.034 --> 35:17.951
<i>We're gamers.</i>

35:17.951 --> 35:19.494
We're competitive people.

35:19.494 --> 35:21.330
<i>Let's go, keep it clean. Come on!</i>

35:23.123 --> 35:24.166
Oh, God.

35:24.166 --> 35:26.293
This entire thing is
a marketing extravaganza.

35:26.293 --> 35:28.587
Get in the chopper.
Let us get a few shots.

35:28.587 --> 35:30.464
- Doing what?
- Follow the kids around the track,

35:30.464 --> 35:33.717
make some notes,
act like an engineer, look cool.

35:33.717 --> 35:36.803
There's no way I would evaluate
race car drivers from a helicopter.

35:36.803 --> 35:39.640
It's the dumbest thing
I have ever heard in my whole life.

35:40.432 --> 35:41.850
I'm not getting in that thing.

35:50.150 --> 35:52.694
Looking good, Matty.
You're looking good on the straight there.

35:52.694 --> 35:53.737
<i>Nice line.</i>

35:57.574 --> 35:59.326
<i>Come on, you gotta go. Punch it!</i>

36:00.244 --> 36:03.705
<i>I will be your judge. I will be your jury.</i>

36:04.289 --> 36:06.875
All right, come on, you gamer kids.

36:06.875 --> 36:09.253
This must be a new experience for you.

36:09.253 --> 36:11.171
Last time you stretched your legs

36:11.171 --> 36:15.175
was to go get another packet
of Hot Pockets from the freezer.

36:15.175 --> 36:16.927
You get tired, you get sloppy.

36:16.927 --> 36:18.554
You get sloppy, you get hurt.

36:18.554 --> 36:20.430
Then you lose races!

36:20.430 --> 36:23.684
I heard your trainer Jack can be
a little hard on the team.

36:23.684 --> 36:25.394
I mean, he means it well.

36:25.394 --> 36:27.229
<i>He's tough, but it's like tough love.</i>

36:27.229 --> 36:29.022
I need you to be faster than this.

36:29.022 --> 36:31.400
Don't think, just react.

36:31.400 --> 36:34.862
You're gonna be hot in the car.
You're gonna be tired. Focus!

36:36.822 --> 36:38.448
Jack thinks we just suck.

36:38.448 --> 36:41.743
Grabbed a bunch of cones back there.
Extra points!

36:41.743 --> 36:44.121
And I will decide who is eliminated.

36:47.291 --> 36:49.251
Close that gap. Let's close that gap.

36:57.134 --> 36:58.552
<i>No, no, no, no!</i>

36:58.552 --> 36:59.761
No!

37:01.054 --> 37:02.556
Jesus Christ.

37:05.684 --> 37:07.269
Sorry about the car.

37:08.353 --> 37:09.188
Good luck.

37:09.188 --> 37:11.064
<i>We'll cut you down to five.</i>

37:11.064 --> 37:13.066
<i>Those five will compete in a final race.</i>

37:13.066 --> 37:14.818
Bye!

37:15.861 --> 37:17.654
Keep going! Keep going!

37:17.654 --> 37:21.283
<i>If your name's below the red line
at the end of this, you're out.</i>

37:23.410 --> 37:26.079
You're ruining my enjoyment
of these chips.

37:28.999 --> 37:29.833
Hello.

37:30.584 --> 37:33.795
I didn't think it was gonna be
so physically demanding.

37:35.839 --> 37:37.466
You puked on my lawn.

37:37.466 --> 37:39.051
<i>Goodbye, Henry.</i>

37:45.349 --> 37:47.434
No, no, no. Come on, come on!

37:51.396 --> 37:53.065
Goodbye, Chloe.

37:53.065 --> 37:58.028
I wasn't into sports and I didn't know
that we had so much working out.

37:58.028 --> 37:59.196
Klaus.

38:00.739 --> 38:01.949
Can I have a word?

38:02.783 --> 38:05.661
Good effort, son.
Here's a cap and a shirt for you.

38:05.661 --> 38:08.080
See that car? That'll take you home.

38:10.666 --> 38:11.834
Bye, Klaus.

38:12.459 --> 38:14.086
<i>What's your biggest fear?</i>

38:15.128 --> 38:18.340
I guess going home
and proving everybody right.

38:21.718 --> 38:22.761
<i>You know, that...</i>

38:23.345 --> 38:27.474
that this, it was impossible
and this wasn't meant to be.

38:27.474 --> 38:30.894
Passing is the art of conviction.

38:30.894 --> 38:32.604
<i>You're coming into turn 15.</i>

38:32.604 --> 38:35.774
It's got a late apex. The exit tightens.

38:35.774 --> 38:37.484
You gotta find your moment to pass.

38:37.484 --> 38:38.944
Come on. What you got? What you got?

38:38.944 --> 38:41.029
Come on, there's a gap. Go, go, go.

38:41.029 --> 38:42.364
<i>Wait for the window.</i>

38:43.198 --> 38:45.659
Come on, turn it! Go! Go, go, go, go!

38:51.748 --> 38:52.958
Not today.

38:56.587 --> 38:58.547
- Brake! Brake!
- I'm trying!

39:03.343 --> 39:04.344
Good night.

39:08.432 --> 39:09.433
You okay?

39:09.433 --> 39:11.310
Jesus Christ.

39:11.977 --> 39:12.978
I braked.

39:16.315 --> 39:17.149
Jesus.

39:17.149 --> 39:19.026
But I braked. I braked, I braked.

39:19.902 --> 39:21.987
- I'm so sorry.
- You can't be afraid in the car.

39:21.987 --> 39:24.531
I wasn't afraid. I braked.
I don't know what happened.

39:24.531 --> 39:25.866
Gotta commit!

39:25.866 --> 39:27.451
You okay? You okay?

39:28.368 --> 39:29.411
It work in your game?

39:29.411 --> 39:31.413
Are you okay? Are you okay?

39:43.592 --> 39:45.302
<i>Dude, you crashed a car with Jack inside.</i>

39:46.929 --> 39:48.222
That was insane.

39:48.889 --> 39:49.973
Terrifying.

39:49.973 --> 39:52.017
Listen, you gotta commit.

39:52.017 --> 39:55.646
You know if you don't commit
in the turn, it's our lives on the line.

39:55.646 --> 39:56.647
Uncanny.

39:57.940 --> 40:00.484
I don't know if I was more scared
of the crash or of Jack.

40:01.235 --> 40:04.321
- You actually got a bit lucky.
- Yeah, I think I did.

40:04.905 --> 40:08.534
Clearly, I mean, you haven't been
behind the wheel before, have you?

40:08.534 --> 40:10.953
No, I don't think any of us have.

40:10.953 --> 40:13.497
The whole point is
to find someone who hasn't.

40:13.497 --> 40:16.416
Well, I think
the point is to win. Isn't it?

40:17.626 --> 40:18.919
Is there a problem?

40:18.919 --> 40:20.379
I don't know. Is there?

40:22.256 --> 40:23.757
I'm in first place, baby.

40:23.757 --> 40:25.300
- He's humble too.
- Yeah.

40:25.300 --> 40:26.885
But you heard Jack.

40:26.885 --> 40:28.637
I mean, there's no shame
in going home, right?

40:28.637 --> 40:31.682
- Yeah, did you hear that?
- That's exactly what I heard.

40:37.938 --> 40:40.274
If you're not gonna commit to a pass...

40:43.235 --> 40:48.156
If you, in the moment,
you decide, "I'm not gonna go"...

40:50.075 --> 40:52.077
I mean, you gotta fall back,
you gotta brake early...

40:52.077 --> 40:54.413
I tried. The brakes didn't respond.

40:54.413 --> 40:55.330
Excuse me?

40:59.251 --> 41:01.587
I tried to brake and the brakes didn't--

41:01.587 --> 41:03.213
Brakes not working?

41:03.213 --> 41:05.382
That's not what I said.
But I felt like they were glazed.

41:05.382 --> 41:08.635
Oh, they were glazed. Yeah.
They were glazed.

41:08.635 --> 41:11.096
How do you know?
How do you know something like that?

41:11.096 --> 41:13.056
'Cause I've been driving
these cars for years.

41:14.308 --> 41:15.475
In a video game.

41:16.977 --> 41:19.271
We're in real life now, okay?

41:19.271 --> 41:20.606
This is reality.

41:22.983 --> 41:24.443
If you're not gonna commit,

41:24.443 --> 41:28.280
if you're not gonna have conviction
on that track...

41:29.948 --> 41:31.992
<i>you make mistakes like that,</i>

41:31.992 --> 41:34.286
next time we might not be so lucky.

41:37.706 --> 41:39.750
That's it. Get out.

41:49.259 --> 41:52.346
Why do you think we're here?
Because we know how these cars work.

41:52.346 --> 41:54.598
I know what I'm talking about.
I'm not afraid.

41:59.269 --> 42:00.312
Come on, man.

42:00.979 --> 42:03.565
Been doing this for 25 years.

42:04.441 --> 42:06.652
I know when someone's afraid.

42:06.652 --> 42:10.697
Best-case scenario, that guy doesn't win.

42:14.034 --> 42:15.827
And that's what we got here.

42:17.120 --> 42:20.165
There's no shame in that. It's okay.

42:20.165 --> 42:24.336
It's a small percentage of the population
that can do this, all right?

42:24.336 --> 42:25.420
I get it.

42:26.046 --> 42:27.923
But it's time to quit.

42:27.923 --> 42:29.591
If those brakes don't turn out
to be glazed,

42:29.591 --> 42:30.843
you're going home anyways.

42:59.496 --> 43:02.040
He was right. The brakes are glazed.

43:24.229 --> 43:25.063
Hey.

43:34.156 --> 43:35.866
How'd you know that about the car?

43:37.910 --> 43:41.330
I've spent hours setting up cars in <i>GT.</i>

43:42.539 --> 43:46.251
You know, I know you think
it's just a simulator, but it's good.

43:50.422 --> 43:51.715
Tomorrow's your shot.

43:52.758 --> 43:54.134
Marcel's out.

43:55.093 --> 43:56.803
<i>You're in the final five.</i>

43:56.803 --> 43:58.430
Final race in the morning.

44:05.395 --> 44:09.566
Yes!

44:34.842 --> 44:36.009
Do you hear this?

44:36.844 --> 44:37.678
Yeah.

44:41.098 --> 44:41.932
Dude.

44:42.516 --> 44:44.226
- Jann.
- What?

44:45.769 --> 44:47.437
What the hell is that?

44:47.437 --> 44:49.022
It's Kenny G.

44:49.982 --> 44:50.983
Who's Kenny G?

44:50.983 --> 44:53.694
Dude, we have a huge race tomorrow.
It's just chilling me out.

44:54.278 --> 44:55.279
I'll turn it down.

44:56.280 --> 44:57.114
Sorry.

44:58.740 --> 44:59.575
Dude.

45:40.073 --> 45:41.491
<i>All right. This is it.</i>

45:44.828 --> 45:46.455
<i>This is what it's all been leading to.</i>

45:50.959 --> 45:52.461
<i>This is not a game.</i>

45:53.879 --> 45:55.214
<i>This is a race.</i>

45:57.758 --> 46:01.053
<i>All your weeks here at the GT Academy
have led to this,</i>

46:01.053 --> 46:03.805
<i>and I've imparted to you
everything I know about racing.</i>

46:05.057 --> 46:08.727
<i>Now it's time for you
to show me what you've got</i>

46:08.727 --> 46:11.021
<i>and what kind of competitors you are.</i>

46:14.316 --> 46:16.026
<i>There will be a winner.</i>

46:17.319 --> 46:18.695
And there will be...

46:19.905 --> 46:20.906
losers.

46:21.615 --> 46:22.699
Good luck.

46:30.499 --> 46:31.500
It's a...

46:32.918 --> 46:36.338
It's a family thing.
It's the team my dad used to play for.

46:52.896 --> 46:54.106
It's just a game.

46:56.316 --> 46:58.026
<i>Course is green. Track is all clear.</i>

46:59.403 --> 47:03.156
<i>All cars on the grid.
Safety vehicles released to the track.</i>

47:03.949 --> 47:05.951
You're playing a game. It's just a game.

47:05.951 --> 47:08.537
When in doubt, throttle out.

47:14.042 --> 47:15.127
You got this.

47:27.347 --> 47:29.349
<i>These cars are heavy and fast.</i>

47:31.977 --> 47:33.437
<i>Control those vehicles.</i>

47:48.118 --> 47:48.994
Yes!

47:52.080 --> 47:53.373
No!

47:55.375 --> 47:57.961
Yes. Yes!

48:03.550 --> 48:05.177
<i>Completed lap 2.</i>

48:07.304 --> 48:08.847
<i>Three laps to go.</i>

48:10.224 --> 48:11.391
<i>Those are nice splits.</i>

48:13.268 --> 48:14.561
Try harder, Jann.

48:22.819 --> 48:23.904
Damn it!

48:25.531 --> 48:26.573
Yes.

48:31.537 --> 48:32.955
Oh, there you are. Okay.

48:44.591 --> 48:46.385
<i>This is it. Final lap.</i>

48:46.385 --> 48:47.511
Come on, Jann.

48:49.179 --> 48:50.264
Commit.

48:51.515 --> 48:52.641
Commit!

49:03.402 --> 49:05.445
Okay, you came to drive, Stretch!

49:21.211 --> 49:22.045
No.

49:25.549 --> 49:26.592
No!

49:27.342 --> 49:28.760
No! No.

49:29.386 --> 49:30.387
Come on, Jann.

49:45.277 --> 49:47.029
Come on, Matty. Do it, baby. Come on.

49:51.158 --> 49:52.326
Yes. Come on.

49:59.583 --> 50:01.418
- Matty took it.
- No, wait, wait, wait.

50:01.418 --> 50:03.128
No, no, no, hang on, hang on.

50:03.128 --> 50:06.256
We gotta watch that back.
Can I get playback?

50:08.425 --> 50:09.426
Guys.

50:10.135 --> 50:11.261
<i>Was that me that--?</i>

50:14.056 --> 50:16.016
Did I win? Who had that?

50:31.198 --> 50:32.449
Mate, who won?

50:32.449 --> 50:34.451
I don't know. I don't know.

50:37.079 --> 50:38.121
Rewind a little.

50:40.499 --> 50:41.500
Zoom in there.

50:44.711 --> 50:47.172
No. Mardenborough won.

50:48.215 --> 50:50.801
- Announce it.
- Hold on. Hold on.

50:50.801 --> 50:52.427
Jack. Jack.

50:56.390 --> 50:58.100
Is this really what we want?

50:59.017 --> 51:02.855
Just look at this from
a high-level marketing perspective, okay?

51:03.647 --> 51:05.732
Does Jann give us the best shot?

51:05.732 --> 51:07.860
I don't know what that means. He won.

51:07.860 --> 51:09.278
By a thousandth of a second.

51:09.278 --> 51:11.822
Yeah, that's the difference
between winning and losing. Jann won.

51:12.698 --> 51:13.532
<i>Jann...</i>

51:14.199 --> 51:17.661
Look, he stumbles in front of the camera.
He's not press-ready. He's not confident.

51:17.661 --> 51:19.955
The whole idea of this thing, Jack,

51:19.955 --> 51:22.666
it hangs on one
of these two kids' shoulders.

51:23.917 --> 51:26.753
Matty's a millionth of a second behind.
I mean, who cares?

51:26.753 --> 51:30.299
He is ultimately our best pick
when you take him out into the world.

51:35.095 --> 51:36.096
- Who won?
- Right.

51:37.848 --> 51:39.224
Yep. Copy that.

51:39.224 --> 51:40.934
The winner is...

51:45.355 --> 51:47.608
- You are the winner.
- Yes!

51:50.611 --> 51:52.154
Way to go, Jann!

51:54.573 --> 51:56.491
Well, and so it begins.

52:40.035 --> 52:41.745
<i>- Hello, sweetheart.</i>
- Mum.

52:42.663 --> 52:45.123
I kind of won GT Academy.

52:45.123 --> 52:48.752
<i>Really? That's amazing. I'm happy for you.</i>

52:48.752 --> 52:49.920
Yeah, it was amazing.

52:49.920 --> 52:53.298
It was incredible.
You would have loved it.

52:53.298 --> 52:55.425
- I wish you were here.
<i>- I wish I was there too.</i>

52:56.301 --> 52:58.512
Where's Dad? I wanna tell him.

52:58.512 --> 53:01.223
<i>He's just left for Coby's game.</i>

53:01.223 --> 53:02.683
<i>But I'll let him know.</i>

53:02.683 --> 53:04.434
<i>I'm really proud of you.</i>

53:04.434 --> 53:06.562
Yeah. It's mental.

53:07.437 --> 53:10.357
Yeah, they're taking me
on a Learjet to Vienna tomorrow.

53:10.357 --> 53:11.692
<i>I'll be watching.</i>

53:11.692 --> 53:13.026
<i>And I love you.</i>

53:13.777 --> 53:14.778
I love you back.

53:21.535 --> 53:22.703
A little bit of bubbly.

53:23.328 --> 53:25.789
First time on a private jet.
Here, have a glass.

53:25.789 --> 53:27.916
- Sweet. Thanks.
- Ah, sorry.

53:27.916 --> 53:31.170
Champagne is for the podium only.

53:32.004 --> 53:33.964
We'll take a couple beers.
Thank you very much.

53:33.964 --> 53:36.258
That's fair. Let's save it for a win.

53:37.509 --> 53:41.597
Nissan has agreed to fund you
through the Dubai enduro,

53:41.597 --> 53:43.682
under the condition
you get your racing license.

53:43.682 --> 53:46.435
So we'll start in the European series.
You following?

53:46.435 --> 53:47.519
Yes.

53:47.519 --> 53:50.939
You've gotta finish fourth place or better
in just one race of the series

53:50.939 --> 53:52.649
to get your FIA license.

53:52.649 --> 53:55.611
When you get that license,
Nissan will give you a contract.

53:56.445 --> 53:58.864
You're not gonna be racing against gamers.

53:58.864 --> 54:01.491
These guys are
legit professional athletes.

54:02.326 --> 54:04.119
You don't have
the strength and the stamina

54:04.119 --> 54:08.165
to compete at this level at this point,
but we'll get into all that.

54:08.165 --> 54:11.752
For this one, though,
you gotta prove that you belong.

54:11.752 --> 54:14.546
And nobody's gonna welcome you
into this world.

54:14.546 --> 54:17.508
The other drivers, your pit crew,

54:17.508 --> 54:19.426
nobody wants you there.

54:20.302 --> 54:24.473
If you have any feedback about anything,

54:24.473 --> 54:26.058
you're gonna tell me.

54:26.642 --> 54:30.270
'Cause the mechanics are going
to hate you.

54:34.566 --> 54:35.567
Okay.

54:36.401 --> 54:39.821
I'm gonna get some sleep
'cause I can't stand flying.

54:41.490 --> 54:42.783
Get some rest.

54:43.617 --> 54:44.701
He's fun.

54:48.038 --> 54:49.039
Seriously...

54:50.123 --> 54:51.500
Jack was a great racer.

54:52.167 --> 54:53.502
I mean, possibly...

54:54.169 --> 54:58.048
could have been one of the best Americans
of his generation, actually.

54:59.341 --> 55:00.342
He quit.

55:01.093 --> 55:01.927
Why?

55:03.220 --> 55:05.389
Well, that's between you and him.

55:09.560 --> 55:10.686
Yes.

55:18.610 --> 55:20.320
Welcome to Vienna, Jann.

56:24.635 --> 56:26.929
<i>Welcome to Spielberg in Austria.</i>

56:27.930 --> 56:29.306
<i>This one's got a bit of everything.</i>

56:29.306 --> 56:31.934
<i>Heavy braking zones
but also a lot of fast sections.</i>

57:09.221 --> 57:10.722
I'll be on comms the whole time.

57:13.559 --> 57:15.894
You'll be fine. Stay with me.

57:18.105 --> 57:22.526
Good news. No one thinks we can do this,
so low expectations.

57:27.906 --> 57:28.740
Hey.

57:31.702 --> 57:32.703
You got this.

58:22.085 --> 58:24.213
- Blankets off.
- Copy.

58:31.595 --> 58:32.596
Comms check.

58:33.680 --> 58:34.765
Yeah, got you.

59:00.874 --> 59:05.087
<i>All right, it's a rolling start.
Let's get those tires nice and warm.</i>

59:06.588 --> 59:11.009
<i>They're trying to generate as much heat
in the tires as they possibly can.</i>

59:11.009 --> 59:14.346
<i>I don't know exactly how much bandwidth
you have for this right now,</i>

59:14.346 --> 59:15.639
<i>but I feel like we should talk</i>

59:15.639 --> 59:17.599
about some of the players
on the field today.

59:17.599 --> 59:22.604
<i>First of all, my favorite is the guy
in the gold lamé monstrosity over there.</i>

59:22.604 --> 59:23.814
<i>That's Team Capa.</i>

59:23.814 --> 59:26.900
The guy in the white Audi
with the rainbows on it, that's Schulin.

59:26.900 --> 59:28.819
<i>He's gonna be the other bully
on the track today.</i>

59:32.281 --> 59:34.199
I think the thing you have to remember--

59:34.199 --> 59:37.703
This is a first, a world first,
so we're already winning.

59:37.703 --> 59:40.539
<i>You gotta have nerves of steel
coming down into turn one,</i>

59:40.539 --> 59:42.541
<i>as we approach the start line.</i>

59:42.541 --> 59:45.043
<i>Okay, Jann, when that light turns green,
it's go time.</i>

59:45.043 --> 59:48.172
<i>Green, green! Go, go, go!</i>

59:54.386 --> 59:57.598
<i>All right, come on,
keep your nose in it. Let's do this.</i>

59:57.598 --> 59:59.850
<i>Whoa, welcoming committee.</i>

01:00:02.686 --> 01:00:05.522
<i>- On your left!</i>
- What the--? Shit.

01:00:11.153 --> 01:00:13.071
You're all right.
You're all right. Just breathe.

01:00:13.071 --> 01:00:15.240
<i>- Just breathe.</i>
- Okay, come on, Jann.

01:00:16.116 --> 01:00:18.160
Focus, focus, focus.

01:00:21.830 --> 01:00:22.664
Let's go.

01:00:26.126 --> 01:00:29.087
<i>Heading into turn one,
they're tipping on 300 kilometers an hour.</i>

01:00:35.552 --> 01:00:37.346
<i>Get out from behind him.</i>

01:00:39.515 --> 01:00:41.934
Take the inside! You'll be fine.

01:00:41.934 --> 01:00:45.771
<i>Cars explode all the time.
This is normal. Stay focused.</i>

01:00:45.771 --> 01:00:48.190
<i>It's a disaster for the red Ferrari.</i>

01:00:55.239 --> 01:00:58.242
<i>He's not used to this kind of stuff,
so he needs to focus.</i>

01:00:58.242 --> 01:01:00.536
Jack, how am I doing for fuel?

01:01:04.164 --> 01:01:07.084
<i>All right, low fuel.
Next time around, come in to gas up.</i>

01:01:07.084 --> 01:01:09.962
<i>First pit stop
for Jann Mardenborough and Nissan.</i>

01:01:10.754 --> 01:01:11.755
Let's go, go, go!

01:01:12.714 --> 01:01:14.091
Come on, come on!

01:01:19.429 --> 01:01:21.431
It's much easier with a joystick,
isn't it?

01:01:22.266 --> 01:01:23.600
Noob!

01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:24.852
Hey, hey! Listen to me!

01:01:25.561 --> 01:01:27.396
Keep it together out there, all right?

01:01:27.396 --> 01:01:29.731
Breathe! I don't want you to oversteer!

01:01:29.731 --> 01:01:31.817
I want you to keep it together!

01:01:34.695 --> 01:01:37.281
<i>That was pretty textbook
from the Nissan pit crew.</i>

01:01:46.540 --> 01:01:48.542
<i>You've got a good run on him.
Pass him on the right.</i>

01:01:51.503 --> 01:01:52.796
Watch out for Nismo, coming up behind you!

01:01:53.922 --> 01:01:56.508
No! You let him take the inside!

01:01:58.802 --> 01:01:59.803
Shit! Damn gamer!

01:01:59.803 --> 01:02:02.347
<i>That's a great job
from Jann Mardenborough.</i>

01:02:02.347 --> 01:02:04.975
Hey. That was actually pretty great.

01:02:11.732 --> 01:02:14.067
<i>You're coming up on Capa.
He's right ahead.</i>

01:02:27.539 --> 01:02:31.710
<i>Fourth place! All we gotta do is hold
and we got that license.</i>

01:02:36.882 --> 01:02:38.634
Where do you think you're going, amateur?

01:02:43.597 --> 01:02:46.141
All right, watch out for Capa.
He's coming on your outside.

01:02:46.141 --> 01:02:48.644
<i>This guy plays dirty. Watch out for that.</i>

01:02:49.186 --> 01:02:51.188
I'm gonna nerf you, gamer.

01:02:51.188 --> 01:02:52.898
<i>Four back. Three back.</i>

01:03:19.925 --> 01:03:21.426
Goddamn it.

01:03:38.318 --> 01:03:41.572
<i>So it's a P-27 over the line
for Jann Mardenborough.</i>

01:03:41.572 --> 01:03:43.615
<i>Possible naivete through the final...</i>

01:03:48.912 --> 01:03:52.833
Well, at least you finished.
I didn't even think you'd do that.

01:03:54.001 --> 01:03:55.002
Noob.

01:04:05.596 --> 01:04:07.097
It's an okay start.

01:04:07.097 --> 01:04:10.976
There's still six more events this season,
so we'll qualify, all right?

01:04:19.193 --> 01:04:20.819
So how are we feeling?

01:04:20.819 --> 01:04:23.822
Are you still happy about
the choice we made?

01:04:24.740 --> 01:04:26.241
Gotta give him some time.

01:04:27.534 --> 01:04:29.036
All right. It's on you.

01:04:33.624 --> 01:04:34.708
I'm sorry, man.

01:04:35.417 --> 01:04:38.462
It's okay. First race. First race.

01:04:39.046 --> 01:04:39.880
Yeah.

01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:41.590
Crazy out there, isn't it?

01:04:42.633 --> 01:04:43.634
It's insane.

01:04:45.177 --> 01:04:46.428
All right, well...

01:04:48.096 --> 01:04:51.433
We're gonna focus on strength,
we're gonna focus on endurance.

01:04:51.433 --> 01:04:53.894
You're gonna feel better,
you're gonna feel stronger with each race.

01:05:19.461 --> 01:05:21.922
Jack. Jack, hello? Is this working?

01:05:21.922 --> 01:05:24.633
<i>Jack! Hello? Jack! Hello.</i>

01:05:24.633 --> 01:05:26.969
Jack? Are you--?
Shit. I think my radio's broken.

01:05:26.969 --> 01:05:29.429
Hello, Jack? Someone answer me!

01:05:39.523 --> 01:05:41.233
I got a good feeling about this one.

01:05:41.942 --> 01:05:42.943
You got this.

01:05:46.446 --> 01:05:49.700
<i>Another disappointing finish
for Mardenborough.</i>

01:06:07.467 --> 01:06:09.052
Come on. Run, run, run!

01:06:19.062 --> 01:06:22.024
Look alive, look alive!
Hey, watch the gravel trap.

01:06:43.086 --> 01:06:46.381
Nicholas, Nicholas! Nicholas!
What's your take on SIM racers?

01:06:46.381 --> 01:06:49.134
I'm worried, you know? They make it
less safe for the real drivers.

01:06:49.134 --> 01:06:51.303
Do you think a SIM racer can ever win?

01:06:51.303 --> 01:06:53.013
You won't see them on a podium.

01:06:53.722 --> 01:06:56.517
Okay, that's enough for now.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

01:06:56.517 --> 01:06:58.644
Come on.
Let us through, let us through.

01:06:58.644 --> 01:07:01.438
Hey. Hey.
Don't worry about him, all right?

01:07:02.689 --> 01:07:03.941
He's not a better driver than you.

01:07:06.818 --> 01:07:08.153
He's got a bigger allowance.

01:07:22.543 --> 01:07:23.544
Shit!

01:07:23.544 --> 01:07:25.379
<i>Whoa, don't let him take that line.</i>

01:07:25.379 --> 01:07:27.381
- Come on, he's pushing you wide.
- Bullshit.

01:07:27.381 --> 01:07:28.799
<i>Do it!</i>

01:07:31.718 --> 01:07:33.136
Whoopsie.

01:07:34.596 --> 01:07:35.514
Shit!

01:07:36.765 --> 01:07:39.768
<i>The Dubai Autodrome, here in the UAE.</i>

01:07:45.691 --> 01:07:47.442
<i>Is the car functioning all right?</i>

01:07:47.442 --> 01:07:50.529
Jann, is the car functioning okay?

01:07:50.529 --> 01:07:52.614
<i>Fine! The car's okay.</i>

01:07:52.614 --> 01:07:53.907
It's functioning, yes.

01:07:53.907 --> 01:07:56.702
Okay. Okay, get back in the fight, then.

01:07:56.702 --> 01:08:00.414
<i>This is the last chance you have
to qualify for your license.</i>

01:08:00.414 --> 01:08:03.166
<i>We have to finish at least fourth.</i>

01:08:03.166 --> 01:08:04.918
You're still in this race.

01:08:05.836 --> 01:08:07.087
<i>Take a deep breath.</i>

01:08:07.713 --> 01:08:08.589
<i>Focus.</i>

01:08:08.589 --> 01:08:10.299
<i>I know you can do this, Jann.</i>

01:08:37.033 --> 01:08:38.660
Capa and Schulin are up ahead.

01:08:40.412 --> 01:08:41.330
<i>You're gaining back.</i>

01:08:43.832 --> 01:08:46.835
<i>He's threading the needle
between Capa and Schulin.</i>

01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:49.296
You back for more?

01:08:51.673 --> 01:08:52.841
Jack, what is he doing?!

01:08:55.469 --> 01:08:57.888
<i>Easy. Don't lose that line.
Don't lose that line.</i>

01:08:57.888 --> 01:08:59.348
Jack, they're boxing me in.

01:09:01.015 --> 01:09:03.100
Well, then do something about it.

01:09:06.229 --> 01:09:08.314
<i>Hits the brakes, goes down to third!</i>

01:09:08.314 --> 01:09:09.274
What the--?

01:09:17.366 --> 01:09:19.326
See you. Bye!

01:09:19.326 --> 01:09:21.203
That's what I'm talking about!

01:09:22.662 --> 01:09:23.663
Aw, shit!

01:09:27.209 --> 01:09:28.252
<i>Watch your six.</i>

01:09:34.174 --> 01:09:36.844
Oh, my God, he's gaining way
too much speed. What is he doing?

01:09:55.237 --> 01:09:58.365
Shit! Capa's tire just shattered
my windscreen.

01:09:58.365 --> 01:10:00.993
Okay, pit now. Pit. Yellow's out.

01:10:07.708 --> 01:10:08.709
Hey, you all right?

01:10:11.670 --> 01:10:14.464
- Can you see through this thing?
- Yeah.

01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:19.136
Are you okay? Come this way, please.

01:10:19.136 --> 01:10:21.471
Let's get you checked. How do you feel?

01:10:22.014 --> 01:10:23.265
<i>The safety team arriving...</i>

01:10:23.265 --> 01:10:27.060
<i>It is all clear for Nick Capa.
He's absolutely furious.</i>

01:10:29.438 --> 01:10:31.023
Stay calm, all right?

01:10:33.150 --> 01:10:35.027
- Ready to go!
- All right. Green. Go!

01:10:40.490 --> 01:10:41.575
Stay ahead of Schulin!

01:10:46.496 --> 01:10:50.083
<i>Racing once again.
And we're right into the final lap.</i>

01:10:50.083 --> 01:10:51.502
<i>You gotta hold Schulin off.</i>

01:10:51.502 --> 01:10:54.421
You're in fourth place,
but you gotta play defense.

01:11:04.014 --> 01:11:06.683
<i>Do not let him get under you
in these turns.</i>

01:11:12.564 --> 01:11:15.025
This is it. Last turn and final straight.

01:11:15.025 --> 01:11:16.652
- Drop the hammer!
- Roger that.

01:11:25.118 --> 01:11:27.579
<i>Will the German get the better
of the young rookie?</i>

01:11:29.498 --> 01:11:31.208
<i>Watch that checkered flag!</i>

01:11:40.384 --> 01:11:42.135
- Yes!
- Yes!

01:11:42.135 --> 01:11:43.470
- Fuck!
- Yes!

01:11:43.470 --> 01:11:45.305
Whoa, fourth!

01:11:45.305 --> 01:11:47.516
<i>That's your FIA license, kid.</i>

01:11:47.516 --> 01:11:49.476
Yes! Yes!

01:11:51.603 --> 01:11:52.437
Yeah, baby!

01:11:57.526 --> 01:11:59.027
Dude, what is your problem?!

01:11:59.027 --> 01:12:00.863
It's part of the game. It's called racing.

01:12:00.863 --> 01:12:03.740
Are you for real? You almost killed me!
You almost killed me!

01:12:03.740 --> 01:12:07.578
Do that again and watch what happens.
Try that shit again. I'm serious.

01:12:07.578 --> 01:12:09.621
You almost killed me and yourself!

01:12:10.289 --> 01:12:11.540
I'm serious!

01:12:11.540 --> 01:12:14.751
Hey! Hey! You came in fourth!

01:12:15.878 --> 01:12:17.462
You came in fourth!

01:12:17.462 --> 01:12:20.132
- FIA license, baby!
- You got your license!

01:12:20.132 --> 01:12:23.719
You did it! You did it! Forget that guy.

01:12:24.261 --> 01:12:26.138
You broke your cherry!

01:12:26.138 --> 01:12:28.640
You got your license!

01:12:40.777 --> 01:12:41.612
Hey.

01:12:45.532 --> 01:12:46.783
Got you a beer.

01:12:47.618 --> 01:12:48.619
Thank you.

01:12:49.870 --> 01:12:51.663
- So.
- Yes?

01:12:51.663 --> 01:12:55.792
You were pretty damn good today.

01:12:56.835 --> 01:12:59.796
- Don't sound so surprised.
- I am surprised.

01:12:59.796 --> 01:13:01.840
I'm very surprised.

01:13:03.592 --> 01:13:06.887
You got instincts. That can't be taught.

01:13:07.721 --> 01:13:09.681
Did you feel it when you were out there?

01:13:10.849 --> 01:13:14.645
That thing where time slows down,

01:13:14.645 --> 01:13:17.356
and you feel like the car's on rails.

01:13:17.356 --> 01:13:19.691
You feel like you can't make a mistake.

01:13:19.691 --> 01:13:22.069
Feels like nothing and everything
at the same time.

01:13:27.616 --> 01:13:29.660
Jesus, I miss that so much.

01:13:29.660 --> 01:13:31.912
That's the only thing
I miss about being in the car.

01:13:31.912 --> 01:13:35.791
Now I only get it when I, you know, listen
to early Black Sabbath or something.

01:13:35.791 --> 01:13:38.001
Just, like, the bullshit fades away.

01:13:38.001 --> 01:13:40.003
That's what you're listening to
on this thing?

01:13:40.003 --> 01:13:41.922
- Black Sabbath?
- Yeah.

01:13:41.922 --> 01:13:44.967
You know, they make these
that hold more than eight songs.

01:13:44.967 --> 01:13:47.094
I'm nostalgic, what do you want?

01:13:47.094 --> 01:13:51.348
Hey, what are you gonna do
with that big ol' signing bonus?

01:13:51.348 --> 01:13:52.266
I don't know.

01:13:53.350 --> 01:13:55.811
I'll probably put it towards a flat.

01:13:56.562 --> 01:13:57.729
You're such a nerd.

01:13:58.438 --> 01:14:01.650
Why don't you take a bunch of it
and blow it on a first-class ticket

01:14:01.650 --> 01:14:05.529
for that girl you're obsessed with
and fly her out here

01:14:05.529 --> 01:14:07.781
to be there
for the signing event with you.

01:14:07.781 --> 01:14:08.866
I don't have a girl.

01:14:08.866 --> 01:14:11.493
You don't have a girl?
Who's the girl that you're looking at,

01:14:11.493 --> 01:14:14.496
like, hundreds of pictures
on your phone all day long?

01:14:14.496 --> 01:14:15.956
Who's that girl?

01:14:15.956 --> 01:14:17.457
- You rookie.
- Danny...

01:14:18.876 --> 01:14:21.170
Danny told me
you were an incredible driver.

01:14:22.087 --> 01:14:22.921
Yeah?

01:14:24.089 --> 01:14:26.675
Yeah. What was your favorite track?

01:14:26.675 --> 01:14:28.135
Le Mans. Hands down.

01:14:28.135 --> 01:14:29.845
- Really?
- Yes.

01:14:29.845 --> 01:14:31.972
- Why?
- It's a perfect track.

01:14:32.598 --> 01:14:34.141
Nowhere tests you like that.

01:14:34.808 --> 01:14:37.769
You podium at Le Mans
and you live forever.

01:14:37.769 --> 01:14:40.147
- You become immortal.
- Did you?

01:14:40.772 --> 01:14:44.109
No. I did not. I am still mortal.

01:14:44.610 --> 01:14:46.695
But I did race it. Once.

01:14:46.695 --> 01:14:47.905
What happened?

01:14:47.905 --> 01:14:49.573
You're the racer from today, right?

01:14:49.573 --> 01:14:51.200
Can we get your autograph?

01:14:55.287 --> 01:14:56.288
Yeah, sure.

01:14:56.997 --> 01:14:59.666
- You were amazing, by the way.
- Thank you so much.

01:14:59.666 --> 01:15:01.251
Can I get a selfie as well?

01:15:01.251 --> 01:15:02.669
- For sure.
- Thanks.

01:15:17.809 --> 01:15:19.895
Jann. This is a surprise.

01:15:19.895 --> 01:15:22.481
<i>You know, I was just watching
your story on Insta.</i>

01:15:22.481 --> 01:15:23.565
Oh, really?

01:15:24.399 --> 01:15:25.442
Well, that's crazy.

01:15:25.442 --> 01:15:28.111
<i>I was wondering how many times
I'd have to like them</i>

01:15:28.111 --> 01:15:29.446
before you'd call me.

01:15:30.072 --> 01:15:33.075
Fifty, sixty times?

01:15:33.075 --> 01:15:37.788
Yeah, sorry.
I should have called sooner, but--

01:15:37.788 --> 01:15:40.499
It's okay. You've been busy.

01:15:40.499 --> 01:15:43.001
I was thinking about
that night that you left and...

01:15:43.001 --> 01:15:44.127
Yeah?

01:15:44.127 --> 01:15:46.505
I wish we'd got more time, you know?

01:15:46.505 --> 01:15:48.966
Jann, we have all the time in the world.

01:15:49.925 --> 01:15:51.260
Where do you wanna go?

01:16:24.877 --> 01:16:26.003
How is everybody?

01:16:31.175 --> 01:16:33.552
It's an absolute honor to meet you, sir.

01:16:35.304 --> 01:16:40.893
It took me a decade to prove
that <i>Gran Turismo</i> could work.

01:16:40.893 --> 01:16:45.480
This young man has proven it
in just one year.

01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:46.690
Jann.

01:16:46.690 --> 01:16:49.193
By signing this contract

01:16:49.193 --> 01:16:51.111
as a professional driver,

01:16:52.070 --> 01:16:54.573
you're showing not only gamers...

01:16:55.532 --> 01:16:58.076
but any kid who had a dream...

01:16:58.744 --> 01:17:00.329
that anything is possible.

01:17:00.329 --> 01:17:02.706
Welcome to Team Nissan.

01:17:07.336 --> 01:17:08.212
This way!

01:17:08.212 --> 01:17:12.466
- Jann-san. This way, please.
- Jann-san, please! Look this way.

01:17:13.884 --> 01:17:16.303
Thank you so much. Thank you, thank you.

01:17:16.887 --> 01:17:18.138
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:17:18.722 --> 01:17:19.806
Hey.

01:17:19.806 --> 01:17:20.933
Man of the hour.

01:17:20.933 --> 01:17:23.602
- Yeah, you came.
- Thanks for bringing me here.

01:17:23.602 --> 01:17:27.189
Do you have any time to enjoy Tokyo?
And what sights would you like to see?

01:17:27.814 --> 01:17:30.400
Yeah, I would like to see more of Tokyo.
I would love to.

01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:34.238
Guys, thank you so much. I think we've had
more than enough questions for now.

01:17:34.238 --> 01:17:37.407
Now get out while you can, guys, go.

01:17:37.908 --> 01:17:40.077
Quick, make a run for it. Enjoy the city.

01:17:47.251 --> 01:17:49.461
<i>You and me dreamed of this in Wales,
and now...</i>

01:17:50.587 --> 01:17:51.588
<i>it's real.</i>

01:17:52.506 --> 01:17:53.590
We manifested this.

01:17:57.803 --> 01:17:58.971
Yeah, maybe we did.

01:18:07.271 --> 01:18:08.564
Oh, cool.

01:18:10.566 --> 01:18:11.984
What are you looking at?

01:18:12.776 --> 01:18:14.945
Might buy a gift for a friend.

01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:17.197
<i>Sake?</i>

01:18:18.031 --> 01:18:19.032
After you.

01:18:19.032 --> 01:18:21.618
Or we could order something else.

01:18:21.618 --> 01:18:22.703
What is there?

01:18:22.703 --> 01:18:24.872
Champagne, maybe?
Celebrate your big signing?

01:18:24.872 --> 01:18:26.206
Champagne's for the podium.

01:18:26.748 --> 01:18:28.000
- Oh, okay.
- Sorry.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:29.751
Noted, Mr. Big Shot.

01:18:29.751 --> 01:18:31.086
Thank you so much.

01:18:31.086 --> 01:18:32.254
Thank you.

01:18:36.842 --> 01:18:38.302
That's amazing.

01:18:40.137 --> 01:18:42.806
Man, that is amazing. That is so good.

01:18:43.390 --> 01:18:44.516
More, more, more.

01:19:41.865 --> 01:19:45.202
<i>Most challenging circuit in the world.
So hard to remember.</i>

01:19:45.202 --> 01:19:48.914
<i>It is the most feared circuit
on planet Earth.</i>

01:19:49.540 --> 01:19:52.751
<i>It is, of course,
the Nürburgring Nordschleife.</i>

01:20:07.015 --> 01:20:09.560
Why don't you check out
those numbers over there, all right?

01:20:22.281 --> 01:20:23.115
Hey.

01:20:24.449 --> 01:20:25.284
Hey.

01:20:26.994 --> 01:20:27.995
It's time.

01:20:30.414 --> 01:20:31.540
Yeah.

01:20:32.708 --> 01:20:33.542
You okay?

01:20:35.085 --> 01:20:35.919
Yeah.

01:20:37.087 --> 01:20:37.921
Here.

01:20:40.215 --> 01:20:41.550
What is this, my birthday?

01:20:42.092 --> 01:20:44.970
It's just, I don't know, something I saw.

01:20:45.888 --> 01:20:46.722
Open it later.

01:21:08.035 --> 01:21:09.536
Have a good one, mate.

01:21:09.536 --> 01:21:12.039
<i>It's been an impressive start
to the season</i>

01:21:12.039 --> 01:21:14.625
<i>for the young lad from Wales,
Jann Mardenborough,</i>

01:21:14.625 --> 01:21:19.129
<i>who just a month ago
placed fourth at Dubai Autodrome.</i>

01:21:19.796 --> 01:21:21.048
He looks so young.

01:21:21.590 --> 01:21:24.510
<i>Yeah, the Nordschleife is
the most challenging circuit</i>

01:21:24.510 --> 01:21:27.679
<i>and it's gonna be the biggest challenge
of Jann's career so far.</i>

01:21:37.814 --> 01:21:38.982
All clear. Drop the car.

01:21:42.361 --> 01:21:43.445
You hear me in there?

01:21:44.947 --> 01:21:46.323
Loud and clear.

01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:04.216
<i>Looking good, Jann. Smooth is fast.</i>

01:22:04.216 --> 01:22:05.676
<i>Smooth is fast.</i>

01:22:09.888 --> 01:22:11.515
<i>Very nice! Schulin down.</i>

01:22:11.515 --> 01:22:14.935
<i>Showing fantastic pace
from Jann Mardenborough</i>

01:22:14.935 --> 01:22:17.312
<i>as he's working his way up
through the field.</i>

01:22:29.616 --> 01:22:31.618
Pit for fuel when you come around.

01:22:32.244 --> 01:22:33.161
Copy.

01:23:01.648 --> 01:23:03.066
What the hell?

01:23:03.066 --> 01:23:05.235
<i>Yes! Yes! Yes!</i>

01:23:30.677 --> 01:23:31.929
Was that his car?

01:23:49.196 --> 01:23:50.781
Oh, no!

01:23:50.781 --> 01:23:53.200
<i>That is a terrifying accident
for Jann Mardenborough,</i>

01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:55.827
<i>and all we can do at this moment
is hope he's okay.</i>

01:23:55.827 --> 01:23:58.288
<i>We aren't sure of his condition.
May be still in the car.</i>

01:23:58.288 --> 01:24:01.375
<i>But we hope
that he and the spectators are okay.</i>

01:24:01.375 --> 01:24:02.960
<i>It's a horrible accident.</i>

01:24:28.443 --> 01:24:29.903
Hey, wait!

01:24:29.903 --> 01:24:31.363
Stop, stop!

01:24:36.201 --> 01:24:38.620
Oh, no. Oh, Jann.

01:24:39.413 --> 01:24:41.248
My baby.

01:25:45.812 --> 01:25:47.606
I don't know how we're gonna
explain this to Nissan.

01:25:47.606 --> 01:25:48.815
There's got to be an investigation.

01:25:48.815 --> 01:25:50.526
That's what
you're thinking about right now?

01:25:53.403 --> 01:25:54.863
They could shut us down over this.

01:25:54.863 --> 01:25:57.783
- Okay. Somebody died.
- I understand.

01:26:02.287 --> 01:26:03.121
Hey.

01:26:06.208 --> 01:26:07.376
No, whoa, whoa.

01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:10.504
Hey. Come on.
You need to rest, you need to rest.

01:26:10.504 --> 01:26:11.588
I'm okay.

01:26:19.805 --> 01:26:20.889
What happened?

01:26:22.099 --> 01:26:24.268
It's not your fault, okay?

01:26:27.271 --> 01:26:28.730
It was a freak accident.

01:26:31.900 --> 01:26:33.026
Was someone hurt?

01:26:34.945 --> 01:26:35.946
A spectator.

01:26:35.946 --> 01:26:37.322
Did they die?

01:26:44.997 --> 01:26:47.958
It was an accident.
It is certainly not on you.

01:26:48.584 --> 01:26:49.585
It is on me.

01:26:51.378 --> 01:26:52.754
I should've pitted you sooner.

01:26:52.754 --> 01:26:54.298
- Oh, my God.
- Hey.

01:26:55.632 --> 01:26:57.926
You know why they call
that section <i>Flugplatz?</i>

01:26:57.926 --> 01:26:59.344
It means "airfield."

01:27:00.095 --> 01:27:01.805
Cars lift off there.

01:27:01.805 --> 01:27:05.184
With that headwind, it was like a sail.
It was a freak accident, Jann.

01:27:06.435 --> 01:27:07.603
Come on.

01:27:07.603 --> 01:27:09.688
I shouldn't have been there.

01:27:09.688 --> 01:27:12.691
Someone's dead
because racing is dangerous.

01:27:12.691 --> 01:27:16.195
- I was driving.
- Jann, you can't be blamed for this.

01:27:16.195 --> 01:27:18.947
Can you go? Can you go? I'm done.

01:27:18.947 --> 01:27:20.574
Jann, listen to me, okay?

01:27:20.574 --> 01:27:21.992
Get out!

01:28:02.032 --> 01:28:05.786
I'd like to start
by saying everybody at Nissan

01:28:06.662 --> 01:28:09.957
would like to extend their deepest
condolences to the family of the deceased.

01:28:09.957 --> 01:28:13.418
<i>This was a tragic accident,</i>

01:28:14.253 --> 01:28:15.963
<i>and our hearts go out to them.</i>

01:28:16.797 --> 01:28:18.257
<i>Do you want me to come down there?</i>

01:28:20.259 --> 01:28:21.260
<i>I can.</i>

01:28:23.887 --> 01:28:26.890
That's okay.
I'm not much fun at the moment.

01:28:27.975 --> 01:28:30.060
What about your family?
Have you spoken to them?

01:28:40.571 --> 01:28:44.157
<i>We are, of course,
cooperating with the investigation,</i>

01:28:44.157 --> 01:28:47.536
<i>and we will provide racing officials
and the DMSB</i>

01:28:47.536 --> 01:28:51.248
<i>with any information that would help
prevent this from happening again.</i>

01:28:51.248 --> 01:28:53.041
He should have never been on that track.

01:28:56.628 --> 01:28:58.422
And you should have stayed
where you belong.

01:28:58.422 --> 01:28:59.506
Under the hood.

01:29:21.904 --> 01:29:25.365
<i>The hospital said
you were discharged with no injuries.</i>

01:29:25.365 --> 01:29:27.367
<i>Please let us come and see you.</i>

01:29:29.119 --> 01:29:31.121
I'm not sure if I can do this.

01:29:31.747 --> 01:29:34.291
<i>But, sweetheart,
you know it wasn't your fault, right?</i>

01:29:35.209 --> 01:29:37.044
<i>This could've happened to anybody.</i>

01:29:37.586 --> 01:29:39.296
Yeah, but it happened to me.

01:29:41.590 --> 01:29:44.301
<i>Do you wanna speak to your dad? Or Coby?</i>

01:29:45.385 --> 01:29:47.888
What, so they can just say
they were right?

01:29:47.888 --> 01:29:50.349
<i>He just wants to know you're okay.</i>

01:29:51.391 --> 01:29:53.602
<i>So do I, my baby.</i>

01:30:35.602 --> 01:30:36.603
Let's go.

01:31:20.063 --> 01:31:21.940
You had asked me
what happened at Le Mans.

01:31:25.777 --> 01:31:27.070
I was in a wreck.

01:31:56.683 --> 01:31:58.310
It was a beautiful day.

01:32:00.270 --> 01:32:02.648
It was getting late in that first day,

01:32:02.648 --> 01:32:05.817
and I was coming out
of the Tertre Rouge corner.

01:32:06.527 --> 01:32:08.070
I was coming up on a Ford.

01:32:08.070 --> 01:32:10.906
As I passed him, I saw his car twitch.

01:32:11.490 --> 01:32:12.950
It was like a shiver.

01:32:15.911 --> 01:32:17.704
And then he lost control.

01:32:20.249 --> 01:32:23.085
Car flipped three times
before it hit the barrier.

01:32:23.836 --> 01:32:26.380
Caught on fire like that.
Medics came, pulled me out.

01:32:26.380 --> 01:32:29.091
My gloves were on fire,
but everything else...

01:32:29.091 --> 01:32:30.175
not a scratch.

01:32:30.843 --> 01:32:33.554
But that Ford was in a thousand pieces.

01:32:34.304 --> 01:32:37.099
Tony, the driver,
he died on the way to the hospital.

01:32:39.017 --> 01:32:42.187
They said it wasn't my fault.

01:32:43.897 --> 01:32:46.650
I never got behind the wheel
of a race car ever again.

01:32:49.152 --> 01:32:50.571
I lost my nerve.

01:32:52.447 --> 01:32:56.243
More than that, I lost the chance
to find out how good I could have been.

01:32:59.538 --> 01:33:00.539
I quit.

01:33:03.750 --> 01:33:05.252
I've had to live with that...

01:33:06.503 --> 01:33:07.588
my whole life.

01:33:12.342 --> 01:33:13.802
You wanna walk away...

01:33:15.762 --> 01:33:17.264
nobody would blame you.

01:33:17.264 --> 01:33:18.849
Most people would.

01:33:20.225 --> 01:33:22.311
I got a feeling you're not most people.

01:33:25.022 --> 01:33:28.233
I think you could be the best.

01:33:29.067 --> 01:33:31.528
But if you wanna prove it,
if you wanna be a driver,

01:33:32.154 --> 01:33:34.406
then you gotta get back on that track
and you gotta do it right now.

01:33:34.406 --> 01:33:37.075
Because if you don't, you never will.

01:33:38.160 --> 01:33:41.163
That crash is not gonna define
who you are.

01:33:42.206 --> 01:33:44.166
But how you respond to it...

01:33:45.167 --> 01:33:46.168
will.

01:33:51.924 --> 01:33:53.091
Finish your lap.

01:35:06.248 --> 01:35:07.916
All right, nice and easy.

01:35:08.625 --> 01:35:10.586
- Just hold the line.
- Okay.

01:35:28.854 --> 01:35:31.607
Give it a little speed.
Let's have some fun.

01:35:47.998 --> 01:35:49.041
You're okay.

01:35:55.005 --> 01:35:56.006
What's next?

01:36:13.565 --> 01:36:17.361
The racing commission has finally
come to their decision.

01:36:17.361 --> 01:36:19.655
Good news is they've cleared you.

01:36:20.822 --> 01:36:23.033
Yeah, it's great news.
What's the bad news?

01:36:23.951 --> 01:36:25.452
You looked at your phone lately?

01:36:25.452 --> 01:36:26.787
No.

01:36:26.787 --> 01:36:29.498
Capa and some of the other boys
have taken to Twitter

01:36:29.498 --> 01:36:31.834
to demand we have our license revoked.

01:36:32.793 --> 01:36:37.339
They even started
an anti-SIM driver campaign.

01:36:37.339 --> 01:36:40.384
Several of the other teams have jumped
on the bandwagon

01:36:40.384 --> 01:36:45.055
and are independently
launching cases against us.

01:36:45.055 --> 01:36:46.765
Gotta be kidding me.

01:36:46.765 --> 01:36:48.475
Could that work?

01:36:48.475 --> 01:36:53.021
Let's face it, it doesn't make it easy
for our sponsor to keep carrying us.

01:36:53.021 --> 01:36:56.483
Nissan is considering shutting us down.

01:36:58.485 --> 01:36:59.319
So...

01:37:04.157 --> 01:37:08.579
We gotta prove to them, we gotta prove
to everyone, that we belong.

01:37:09.246 --> 01:37:10.247
How?

01:37:11.039 --> 01:37:16.378
By placing on the podium at Le Mans
with a team of SIM drivers.

01:37:16.378 --> 01:37:18.422
I'm sorry. You're serious?

01:37:18.422 --> 01:37:19.965
Le Mans. You...

01:37:20.799 --> 01:37:23.302
- Podium at Le Mans.
- Yeah.

01:37:24.678 --> 01:37:27.389
I mean, first thing is,
we'd need two other drivers.

01:37:27.389 --> 01:37:29.892
Matty and Antonio, they've both
been racing the lower circuits

01:37:29.892 --> 01:37:32.352
since GT Academy.
I mean, they can do it.

01:37:33.228 --> 01:37:34.479
I believe in you, Jann.

01:37:34.479 --> 01:37:37.274
You've driven this
a thousand times before in the game.

01:37:37.274 --> 01:37:39.026
You can do this in your sleep.

01:37:39.026 --> 01:37:41.361
You've done some amazing things, kid.

01:37:42.905 --> 01:37:44.364
But Le Mans is...

01:37:44.364 --> 01:37:45.866
It's a different animal.

01:37:47.326 --> 01:37:48.660
It's the most physically demanding,

01:37:48.660 --> 01:37:51.079
technically challenging race
in the entire world.

01:37:53.165 --> 01:37:54.416
It's dangerous.

01:37:55.334 --> 01:37:56.752
It tests you.

01:37:59.213 --> 01:38:00.506
I couldn't do it.

01:38:02.341 --> 01:38:03.884
But I know that you can.

01:38:05.802 --> 01:38:07.304
Do you know that you can?

01:38:13.477 --> 01:38:15.229
Let's be immortal.

01:38:20.317 --> 01:38:21.652
We in?

01:38:34.957 --> 01:38:38.210
Are you ready for it, Jann?
It's the big time, baby.

01:38:40.254 --> 01:38:41.964
- Yo.
- How's it going?

01:38:47.594 --> 01:38:48.679
Been watching the tour.

01:38:49.429 --> 01:38:50.639
You look good, Stretch.

01:38:51.139 --> 01:38:53.767
I don't feel so bad
for losing to you anymore.

01:38:53.767 --> 01:38:55.310
Hey, man, look.

01:38:56.520 --> 01:38:59.106
That wreck? It wasn't your fault.

01:38:59.106 --> 01:39:00.357
We got your back.

01:39:01.358 --> 01:39:02.609
I appreciate that.

01:39:04.319 --> 01:39:05.529
- Thank you, man.
- Yeah, bro.

01:39:05.529 --> 01:39:08.073
- Hey, guys.
- Are you boys ready for this?

01:39:13.912 --> 01:39:15.247
This car...

01:39:15.247 --> 01:39:20.502
it's a lot lighter, a lot faster
than the GT-Rs you've been driving.

01:39:22.171 --> 01:39:24.381
It's quicker in the corners,

01:39:25.090 --> 01:39:27.426
it requires more finesse, all right?

01:39:28.135 --> 01:39:31.263
You gotta get the feel
or you'll lock up, you'll spin out.

01:39:32.055 --> 01:39:34.850
Ah, whatever. You're gonna be fine.

01:39:58.498 --> 01:40:02.836
<i>With millions tuning in,
it's the 24 Hours of Le Mans,</i>

01:40:02.836 --> 01:40:05.297
<i>the greatest race in the world.</i>

01:40:07.132 --> 01:40:09.384
Are you ready? I'm excited.

01:40:09.384 --> 01:40:11.970
Good to see you, sir. How are you?

01:40:35.202 --> 01:40:36.203
Ready.

01:40:57.432 --> 01:40:58.475
Noobie.

01:41:01.728 --> 01:41:03.063
Thank you for coming.

01:41:12.990 --> 01:41:14.032
I...

01:41:24.668 --> 01:41:26.628
I didn't support you properly.

01:41:35.470 --> 01:41:39.892
I was trying to protect you. You know?

01:41:40.726 --> 01:41:43.312
So many fathers, so many parents...

01:41:46.148 --> 01:41:49.651
they have these kids
with these big, crazy dreams, you know?

01:41:53.655 --> 01:41:57.326
And that damn PlayStation thing,
I just don't understand that shit, Jann.

01:41:57.326 --> 01:41:58.410
I mean...

01:42:01.330 --> 01:42:02.164
But, hey,

01:42:03.415 --> 01:42:04.625
you did this.

01:42:08.754 --> 01:42:10.881
I'm so goddamn proud of you.

01:42:12.466 --> 01:42:14.051
I did this for you.

01:42:24.061 --> 01:42:25.646
I'm proud of you.

01:42:38.825 --> 01:42:40.577
I've got your back, my boy.

01:42:43.872 --> 01:42:47.209
<i>Just to go over it again,
it's a 24-hour race.</i>

01:42:47.209 --> 01:42:49.586
<i>We start at 3 in the afternoon, daytime.</i>

01:42:49.586 --> 01:42:52.172
<i>We race all night into the next day.</i>

01:42:52.172 --> 01:42:54.007
<i>Race ends at 3.</i>

01:42:54.675 --> 01:42:57.553
We start with three-hour shifts
instead of the normal four.

01:42:57.553 --> 01:42:58.804
Three, six, nine.

01:42:58.804 --> 01:43:01.139
No driver in Le Mans can race
more than 14 hours.

01:43:01.139 --> 01:43:02.432
I just wanna say something.

01:43:02.432 --> 01:43:06.186
When he came to me and said
he was gonna start this GT Academy,

01:43:06.186 --> 01:43:10.190
I thought all of you were completely nuts.

01:43:14.027 --> 01:43:15.654
But you made me a believer.

01:43:20.909 --> 01:43:22.119
Let's go show the world.

01:43:27.082 --> 01:43:29.459
- These guys were in the Academy with Jann.
- Right. Hi.

01:43:29.459 --> 01:43:31.461
- Hey, guys. This is Audrey.
- Hey.

01:43:31.461 --> 01:43:33.172
- Hi!
- Hey.

01:43:33.172 --> 01:43:35.883
- Hi. Nice to meet you. I'm Leah.
- Audrey.

01:43:56.445 --> 01:44:01.450
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, please rise
for the French national anthem.</i>

01:44:19.343 --> 01:44:21.345
<i>The French army has just arrived</i>

01:44:21.345 --> 01:44:26.725
<i>to deliver the flag which will be used
to give the start of the Le Mans 24 Hours.</i>

01:45:11.311 --> 01:45:14.231
<i>Gentlemen, start your engines.</i>

01:45:14.815 --> 01:45:15.649
Let's go.

01:45:16.692 --> 01:45:19.653
<i>One of the world's most iconic races,
the Le Mans 24,</i>

01:45:19.653 --> 01:45:23.240
<i>stands just moments away
at the Circuit de la Sarthe.</i>

01:45:23.240 --> 01:45:26.493
<i>And, Chenny, so many great stories
the length and breadth of this field,</i>

01:45:26.493 --> 01:45:29.204
<i>but for me the one that's taking
my focus right now</i>

01:45:29.204 --> 01:45:31.415
<i>is the incredible story at Nissan.</i>

01:45:31.415 --> 01:45:35.586
<i>Is the last chance the SIM racers get
in professional motorsport?</i>

01:45:35.586 --> 01:45:37.254
<i>There's an awful lot of pressure
on their shoulders.</i>

01:45:37.254 --> 01:45:40.048
Nobody wins this thing
on the first lap, okay?

01:45:41.258 --> 01:45:45.053
You make your day, survive the night,
you live to fight tomorrow.

01:45:48.891 --> 01:45:49.892
Good luck.

01:46:40.692 --> 01:46:43.487
<i>As the cars now leave the grid
for the formation lap</i>

01:46:43.487 --> 01:46:45.656
<i>here at the Circuit de la Sarthe,</i>

01:46:45.656 --> 01:46:49.284
<i>we are just moments away
from the start of this iconic race.</i>

01:47:11.265 --> 01:47:14.810
<i>We're underway already and, listen,
you've gotta be smart going into turn one.</i>

01:47:14.810 --> 01:47:17.437
<i>The tires are still cold.
Contact! Contact in the back!</i>

01:47:17.437 --> 01:47:19.356
<i>We've seen the BMW and the Aston Martin--</i>

01:47:35.497 --> 01:47:38.083
<i>Okay, here we go.</i>

01:47:38.083 --> 01:47:40.127
Mulsanne Straight.

01:47:40.127 --> 01:47:43.463
<i>You could hit a high of 340 kph here.</i>

01:47:43.463 --> 01:47:46.008
<i>You gotta build in enough time
to brake before chicane one.</i>

01:47:46.008 --> 01:47:49.219
Yes, yes. Okay.
I've done this a thousand times.

01:47:49.219 --> 01:47:51.054
<i>Well, not in reality.</i>

01:47:51.054 --> 01:47:52.639
Watch your speed.

01:47:59.771 --> 01:48:02.149
<i>Into the first chicane,
around the outside,</i>

01:48:02.149 --> 01:48:05.068
<i>and it's a lovely move put on there
by Jann Mardenborough.</i>

01:48:05.903 --> 01:48:08.947
<i>Watch those GT3s.
You're way faster than them.</i>

01:48:13.744 --> 01:48:15.037
I see Schulin.

01:48:15.037 --> 01:48:16.997
<i>Come on, Jann! Stay on him!</i>

01:48:21.251 --> 01:48:23.962
<i>On your left!
Ferrari's too slow. Watch out!</i>

01:48:23.962 --> 01:48:24.963
No, no, no. No!

01:48:27.090 --> 01:48:30.385
<i>He gets tapped by the Ferrari!
Schulin up in the air!</i>

01:48:37.976 --> 01:48:39.186
Is he okay?!

01:48:55.619 --> 01:48:58.288
What's he saying? Was it Jann?

01:49:02.084 --> 01:49:05.003
<i>Schulin! Get out, get out, get out!</i>

01:49:06.755 --> 01:49:08.924
<i>Schulin climbs out of the car.</i>

01:49:08.924 --> 01:49:11.760
<i>Making his way out, and that's good
to see from the fire marshals.</i>

01:49:12.636 --> 01:49:14.513
<i>Safety car's out on the track.</i>

01:49:20.227 --> 01:49:21.436
<i>Stay focused.</i>

01:49:22.312 --> 01:49:25.440
All right, they're pulling him out.
He seems all right. He seems all right.

01:49:26.275 --> 01:49:29.236
<i>After that impact,
it's a miracle the car is in one piece</i>

01:49:29.236 --> 01:49:30.988
<i>and the driver could walk away.</i>

01:49:33.991 --> 01:49:35.701
Get behind that safety car.

01:49:43.125 --> 01:49:45.127
<i>Okay, keep your head in, all right? Focus.</i>

01:49:52.885 --> 01:49:56.638
<i>All right, safety's out, race back on.
Let's go, let's go!</i>

01:49:56.638 --> 01:49:57.723
<i>Come on!</i>

01:50:01.768 --> 01:50:02.978
Come on, you hear me?

01:50:05.314 --> 01:50:08.317
<i>Hey, buddy? Hey. Hey, Jann?</i>

01:50:08.317 --> 01:50:11.153
Hey, stay with me.
Stay with me, okay? Stay with me.

01:50:12.446 --> 01:50:15.532
<i>Look, safety's left, okay?
We gotta make up some time.</i>

01:50:16.283 --> 01:50:17.117
<i>Jann.</i>

01:50:19.119 --> 01:50:20.913
Jann, talk to me, pal.

01:50:20.913 --> 01:50:22.581
Jann. Hey, hey, hey.

01:50:22.581 --> 01:50:24.041
Hey, Jann.

01:50:24.041 --> 01:50:26.793
<i>Is it a car problem
or is it a head issue, Will?</i>

01:50:26.793 --> 01:50:30.005
<i>It would be early for anything
to be wrong with that car,</i>

01:50:30.005 --> 01:50:31.423
<i>which has shown good pace.</i>

01:50:37.262 --> 01:50:38.305
Bitch.

01:50:39.473 --> 01:50:40.891
Shit.

01:50:40.891 --> 01:50:42.017
<i>Jack!</i>

01:50:42.017 --> 01:50:43.727
We need to bring him in.

01:50:45.771 --> 01:50:47.147
Then do something.

01:50:47.147 --> 01:50:49.566
Just get his head back in this game.

01:51:07.543 --> 01:51:08.377
Dude.

01:51:09.378 --> 01:51:11.380
Dude, what the hell? Turn it off.

01:51:15.926 --> 01:51:17.219
Turn it off!

01:51:17.219 --> 01:51:19.096
<i>Now! Turn it off!</i>

01:51:19.847 --> 01:51:23.100
Okay, let me just--
Oh, God, I don't know how to--

01:51:23.100 --> 01:51:25.310
I told you,
I don't how to work these things.

01:51:26.061 --> 01:51:29.147
<i>Shit, Jack, turn it off now!</i>

01:51:30.482 --> 01:51:31.692
Shit.

01:51:32.401 --> 01:51:33.610
Off.

01:51:40.576 --> 01:51:41.577
You mad, bro?

01:51:42.119 --> 01:51:43.662
Fucking yes!

01:51:43.662 --> 01:51:45.414
Yes, I'm mad!

01:51:45.414 --> 01:51:46.832
Yeah!

01:51:46.832 --> 01:51:49.668
Well, get mad! It's about time!

01:51:49.668 --> 01:51:52.212
Come on! Get in the fight!

01:51:52.212 --> 01:51:54.131
I know you're scared.

01:51:54.798 --> 01:51:56.341
I've been scared.

01:51:57.050 --> 01:52:00.387
Whether you like it or not,
you are in this race.

01:52:00.387 --> 01:52:04.349
So you take all that Kenny G anger
and you unleash it!

01:52:04.349 --> 01:52:05.976
<i>You hear me?</i>

01:52:05.976 --> 01:52:07.269
Yes, sir.

01:52:07.269 --> 01:52:09.313
<i>All right.</i>

01:52:09.313 --> 01:52:10.397
<i>Go get 'em!</i>

01:52:22.534 --> 01:52:24.953
<i>It's like he suddenly remembered
he was a racing driver.</i>

01:52:24.953 --> 01:52:29.917
<i>Absolutely phenomenal display
by the debutante here in that Nissan.</i>

01:52:29.917 --> 01:52:31.793
All right, all right.

01:52:36.340 --> 01:52:39.468
All right, coming up on Lotus.
Three seconds ahead.

01:52:42.054 --> 01:52:43.639
<i>Let's make up some ground.</i>

01:52:44.139 --> 01:52:45.724
<i>You have the same power on the straight,</i>

01:52:45.724 --> 01:52:48.435
but if you get in the corner,
you'll be able to pass him, all right?

01:52:49.019 --> 01:52:51.063
Okay, copy. Let me concentrate, old man.

01:52:51.063 --> 01:52:52.731
Yeah, all right. Roger that. Copy.

01:53:10.374 --> 01:53:12.709
Yes! Yes!

01:53:12.709 --> 01:53:16.588
<i>Beautiful stuff from Jann Mardenborough
and from this Nissan team.</i>

01:53:19.967 --> 01:53:21.051
Yes!

01:53:21.718 --> 01:53:22.803
All right.

01:53:23.720 --> 01:53:26.223
Now we only got 150 laps to go.

01:53:26.932 --> 01:53:31.019
<i>He pulled that first stint back,
and Jann Mardenborough into the pits</i>

01:53:31.019 --> 01:53:33.188
<i>for the first driver change for Nissan.</i>

01:53:33.188 --> 01:53:35.148
Fast out there, man. Let's go, Matty!

01:53:35.148 --> 01:53:36.733
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

01:53:41.822 --> 01:53:42.990
Adiós!

01:53:44.074 --> 01:53:46.618
<i>As the sun goes down,
it's a whole new ballgame.</i>

01:53:48.745 --> 01:53:49.913
Don't rush it.

01:53:49.913 --> 01:53:51.748
<i>I'm gonna take the inside line, Jack.</i>

01:53:54.251 --> 01:53:55.669
- Yeah! Yes!
- Yo, son!

01:53:55.669 --> 01:53:56.670
Yes!

01:53:56.670 --> 01:53:59.214
- Maybe you boys can actually drive.
- You know we can drive.

01:53:59.214 --> 01:54:00.924
<i>Oh, yeah, jury's still out.</i>

01:54:08.891 --> 01:54:09.892
<i>You're in P-9.</i>

01:54:13.645 --> 01:54:17.232
Get tires ready. Here we go.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

01:54:19.234 --> 01:54:20.986
<i>All leaders are on full wets.</i>

01:54:35.042 --> 01:54:36.793
<i>Jann's doing great, isn't he?</i>

01:54:36.793 --> 01:54:39.505
- Do you think so?
- You joking? Mate, he's razing it!

01:54:39.505 --> 01:54:41.048
I can't believe it. He's doing amazing.

01:54:42.174 --> 01:54:44.885
Nice and softly, nice and smooth.

01:55:38.856 --> 01:55:39.898
<i>Hey, boys!</i>

01:55:39.898 --> 01:55:41.692
- How are you boys doing?
- Hey, man.

01:55:41.692 --> 01:55:43.861
- Jann, how you feeling?
- I feel good.

01:55:43.861 --> 01:55:45.195
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:55:46.071 --> 01:55:47.072
Rest up.

01:56:00.419 --> 01:56:05.215
<i>First light at Circuit de la Sarthe
at the 24 Hours of Le Mans.</i>

01:56:05.215 --> 01:56:06.758
Here you are, Audrey. Got you a coffee.

01:56:06.758 --> 01:56:08.135
- Thanks.
- No worries.

01:56:08.886 --> 01:56:10.137
How's it looking?

01:56:10.137 --> 01:56:13.849
In fourth, but Antonio is losing ground.

01:56:13.849 --> 01:56:15.267
Not a lot of time left.

01:56:15.809 --> 01:56:18.353
<i>Yeah,
Antonio Cruz clearly struggling there.</i>

01:56:27.446 --> 01:56:28.864
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:56:28.864 --> 01:56:31.658
Antonio's cramping up.
We're gonna pit him early.

01:56:32.659 --> 01:56:34.077
You ready to bring this home?

01:56:36.163 --> 01:56:37.289
Let's go.

01:56:42.794 --> 01:56:43.795
How we looking?

01:56:45.005 --> 01:56:46.673
He's fallen back to fifth.

01:56:49.051 --> 01:56:50.928
All right, let's go, let's go, let's go.

01:56:52.721 --> 01:56:53.889
Get him in and get him out!

01:56:54.473 --> 01:56:56.308
You. Check the radiator.

01:56:59.978 --> 01:57:01.188
Come on, let's go!

01:57:01.855 --> 01:57:02.940
Son, take a seat.

01:57:02.940 --> 01:57:05.609
Change those tires!
Come on, we're losing time!

01:57:05.609 --> 01:57:07.069
Guys, what's going on?

01:57:07.861 --> 01:57:10.155
- I dropped it!
- Oh, my God, what is happening?

01:57:10.155 --> 01:57:12.574
Felix! What are you doing?

01:57:12.574 --> 01:57:15.035
- Guys!
- Felix, come on! Where's the spare?

01:57:15.953 --> 01:57:18.497
Damn it, we just lost our position.
What is happening?

01:57:18.497 --> 01:57:20.958
- Where's the spare? Where's the spare?
- Are you shitting me?!

01:57:26.046 --> 01:57:27.798
Oh, my God.

01:57:27.798 --> 01:57:28.966
Come on!

01:57:28.966 --> 01:57:31.844
<i>Look at that, it's Jack Salter
who comes to the rescue.</i>

01:57:40.060 --> 01:57:43.021
- Always carry a spare.
- Sorry, sir.

01:57:48.861 --> 01:57:50.696
How much did that hurt us?

01:57:50.696 --> 01:57:53.699
We're running ninth, but...

01:58:20.434 --> 01:58:21.977
<i>You're on great pace.</i>

01:58:37.701 --> 01:58:39.453
Why don't you follow the race line?

01:58:39.453 --> 01:58:42.873
You see, the other guys,
they follow that line.

01:58:42.873 --> 01:58:46.793
So if I go wide like this,

01:58:47.461 --> 01:58:48.921
sometimes I beat them.

01:58:48.921 --> 01:58:49.838
Like that.

01:58:59.348 --> 01:59:02.851
Jack, do you remember where this
whole GT Academy idea thing comes from?

01:59:03.560 --> 01:59:04.561
Yeah, I'm listening.

01:59:04.561 --> 01:59:09.358
The whole point of this thing was
to show that <i>GT</i> drivers can drive.

01:59:09.358 --> 01:59:12.444
<i>Okay? I know this track. I know the lines.</i>

01:59:12.444 --> 01:59:15.781
The line is not optimal.
Let me drive it my way.

01:59:16.490 --> 01:59:18.992
- Now, wait a minute. The car won't hold.
- Wait, what's he saying?!

01:59:18.992 --> 01:59:21.578
<i>Yes, it will, Jack, okay?</i>

01:59:21.578 --> 01:59:23.038
I need you to trust me.

01:59:24.081 --> 01:59:25.499
<i>Do you trust me?</i>

01:59:25.499 --> 01:59:28.001
- Please go back to the box.
- What's happening?

01:59:28.001 --> 01:59:29.586
- Jann! Listen.
- Get him out of here!

01:59:29.586 --> 01:59:31.630
Just finish the race.

01:59:31.630 --> 01:59:34.466
There's too much at stake.
It's too big of a risk.

01:59:34.466 --> 01:59:36.468
- You cannot be here. Let's go.
- All right!

01:59:36.468 --> 01:59:38.971
Danny, I didn't come here to finish.

01:59:38.971 --> 01:59:40.848
Sir, this is your last warning.

01:59:40.848 --> 01:59:42.683
I've got this, Danny.

01:59:43.517 --> 01:59:45.143
- Don't push me, pal.
- Yeah.

01:59:45.978 --> 01:59:47.354
You know what, fuck it.

01:59:47.938 --> 01:59:49.398
<i>Follow your line, Jann.</i>

02:00:00.492 --> 02:00:01.326
Come on.

02:00:09.877 --> 02:00:12.504
- Holy shit!
- Yeah, Jann! Let's go!

02:00:13.839 --> 02:00:14.965
<i>That's six.</i>

02:00:17.926 --> 02:00:19.094
<i>Five.</i>

02:00:23.182 --> 02:00:24.183
<i>Four.</i>

02:00:25.851 --> 02:00:27.644
Come on, baby. Come on!

02:00:29.605 --> 02:00:31.648
<i>It's like he's got a cheat mode engaged.</i>

02:00:31.648 --> 02:00:33.567
<i>He does. It's a new lap record!</i>

02:00:34.067 --> 02:00:35.402
Holy shit!

02:00:35.402 --> 02:00:37.196
That's a new lap record for us!

02:00:37.196 --> 02:00:39.489
No, no, no.
That's a new lap record, full stop.

02:00:39.489 --> 02:00:41.700
<i>Mardenborough is on a flyer.</i>

02:00:43.327 --> 02:00:49.541
<i>And we're just shy of 24 hours completed.
We find ourselves now on the final lap.</i>

02:00:53.045 --> 02:00:56.048
<i>You're P-4.
You're six seconds behind Capa.</i>

02:01:16.902 --> 02:01:19.321
You're only four seconds out
from standing on that podium.

02:01:27.329 --> 02:01:29.665
- All right, you see him?
- Yes, I see him.

02:01:31.917 --> 02:01:33.126
<i>Defend your position.</i>

02:01:33.126 --> 02:01:34.878
Defend the podium.

02:01:37.422 --> 02:01:38.549
Buckle up.

02:01:53.522 --> 02:01:54.773
Don't try it, kid.

02:01:59.862 --> 02:02:02.114
Last turn, then straight to the finish.
