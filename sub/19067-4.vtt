01:06.900 --> 01:10.821
[Shiro] Let's hurry up with these repairs.
Zarkon could be here at any moment.

01:10.904 --> 01:13.240
Okay, panel's off. Now, what?

01:13.323 --> 01:16.493
Very simple. Just loosen
the <i>blaxums</i> on the <i>somoflange.</i>

01:18.537 --> 01:20.247
Could you be more specific?

01:20.330 --> 01:23.333
[Allura] <i>Sorry, Hunk, he means</i>
<i>the </i> poklones <i> on the </i> agroclams.

01:23.917 --> 01:27.087
-No, that doesn't help.
-Easy, Hunk. I got this.

01:28.630 --> 01:31.508
[whirring, alarm blaring]

01:31.591 --> 01:34.177
Uh-oh. That can't be good.

01:34.261 --> 01:38.390
-No, not the <i>smalters, </i> the <i>poklones</i>!
-No, no! It's the <i>blaxums</i>!

01:38.473 --> 01:40.517
What are you talking about?

01:47.774 --> 01:50.569
-There. Fixed.
-[Allura] <i>Well done, Pidge!</i>

01:50.652 --> 01:53.238
The tech on this ship
never ceases to amaze me.

01:53.322 --> 01:54.990
It's so mathematically elegant.

01:55.073 --> 01:59.745
Its fit is a 100 times more frictionless
than any exoskeleton we have on Earth.

01:59.828 --> 02:05.042
-It's... beautiful.
-It's not a sunset, Pidge.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.669
You're right. A billion sunsets
just happen every day.

02:07.753 --> 02:11.590
Some genius engineer actually built this.

02:11.673 --> 02:13.634
Kinda looks like a big,
delicious curly fry.

02:13.717 --> 02:15.844
[groans]
What the...?

02:22.225 --> 02:23.518
All right, we're prepared for this.

02:24.186 --> 02:27.230
Remember your rogue projectile
cluster training from the Garrison.

02:27.314 --> 02:29.149
First, we need a temporary shelter.

02:29.232 --> 02:30.275
[grunts]
Wha--?

02:30.359 --> 02:32.778
Oh, sorry, Shiro.
I was trying to hit Keith.

02:33.153 --> 02:34.029
[growls]

02:34.112 --> 02:35.989
[chuckles]
Like that?

02:36.073 --> 02:39.534
Yes! Squishy asteroid fight!

02:39.618 --> 02:41.536
[all grunting, yelling]

02:41.620 --> 02:43.622
[Shiro]
All right, guys.

02:43.705 --> 02:45.957
Oh, oh! Okay, now, it's on!

02:46.041 --> 02:47.834
-[laughing]
-Hmm...

02:47.918 --> 02:51.296
-[Lance] Oh, come on!
-I don't think these are asteroids.

02:51.380 --> 02:53.632
Coran, I'm going to need
a containment unit.

02:53.715 --> 02:54.800
[Coran]
<i>Just a tick.</i>

02:55.675 --> 02:58.387
They appear to be some
sort of hyper-resilient spore.

02:58.470 --> 03:01.431
[Pidge] This bioluminescent pulsing
doesn't seem natural.

03:01.515 --> 03:04.518
It appears programmed.
I think it's a code.

03:04.601 --> 03:07.896
-A code? From who? [grunts]
-I don't know.

03:07.979 --> 03:11.149
I mean, it makes no sense.
You can't program a spore.

03:11.233 --> 03:13.443
If anyone can figure it out,
it's you, Pidge.

03:14.778 --> 03:18.031
[Allura] <i>Before that, everyone needs</i>
<i>to come in for decontamination.</i>

03:19.658 --> 03:21.076
-[Hunk] Ah...
-[Pidge yelping]

03:21.159 --> 03:22.869
-[Hunk laughing]
-[Lance growling]

03:24.955 --> 03:27.207
[screaming]

03:33.880 --> 03:35.590
-[footsteps approaching]
-[door beeping]

03:36.258 --> 03:39.177
Keith, did you happen to see
a mouse come through here?

03:39.261 --> 03:40.595
He has something of mine.

03:40.679 --> 03:42.681
Uh... no.

03:42.764 --> 03:45.559
-I'll find you, Platt.
-Wait, Coran!

03:45.642 --> 03:47.811
Do you think the Galra ever went to Earth?

03:47.894 --> 03:51.022
Is that possible?
They would have taken it over, right?

03:51.106 --> 03:53.608
Oh, I think you'd know
if the Galra were there.

03:53.692 --> 03:57.279
The Blue Lion was there.
Did a Galra pilot the Blue Lion, too?

03:57.362 --> 04:00.991
Hey, why are you asking about my lion?
How many lions do you need?

04:01.074 --> 04:05.245
-What? No, I-I was just--
-Don't "What? No, I-I was just--" me!

04:05.328 --> 04:07.330
You've had your eye
on the Blue Lion from day one!

04:07.414 --> 04:10.000
Well, yeah.
It's the first one we found--

04:10.083 --> 04:11.501
Ah! Bah-bah-bah-bah!

04:11.585 --> 04:15.255
The Blue Lion's with me
and we're very happy together! Very happy!

04:16.839 --> 04:18.091
[Pidge]
<i>Guys! Check this out!</i>

04:19.216 --> 04:22.012
[electronic beeping]

04:22.095 --> 04:23.680
Oh, oh! I've seen this experiment.

04:23.764 --> 04:27.350
But, question: Why do we need
to get electricity from a potato?

04:27.434 --> 04:31.438
What? No, no. I was able to crack
the "sporse code." [chuckles]

04:31.521 --> 04:34.983
I ran the bioluminescent pattern through
a variety of code-breaking sequences,

04:35.066 --> 04:37.360
including this homemade
virtual Turing machine.

04:37.444 --> 04:39.863
Of course, I had to make a few tweaks
to the original design,

04:39.946 --> 04:43.492
because, obviously, there have been
several advancements since he designed it.

04:43.575 --> 04:46.536
Although, you have to admit, Turing was
a shining light in the world of science

04:46.620 --> 04:48.997
-in an age when far too many were still--
-Pidge.

04:49.080 --> 04:50.290
-[yelps]
-What does it say?

04:50.373 --> 04:56.546
Oh, yeah. "Under attack. Galra. Help."
And then, there are coordinates.

04:56.630 --> 04:59.007
It's a distress signal. Good work, Pidge.

04:59.090 --> 05:01.968
Get those coordinates
into the castle-ship's navigation system.

05:04.346 --> 05:07.057
[Coran] <i>The signal came from Olkarion,</i>
<i>home to the Olkari,</i>

05:07.140 --> 05:09.142
<i>a proud class of engineers,</i>

05:09.226 --> 05:13.313
<i>builders of vast cities that could change</i>
<i>shape at the whim of their creators.</i>

05:13.396 --> 05:17.025
[Allura] They had a seemingly
magical ability to manipulate solid metal.

05:17.108 --> 05:18.276
With just a wave of their hands,

05:18.360 --> 05:20.946
they could build a computer
inside a block of steel.

05:21.029 --> 05:24.533
-Whoa.
-An Olkari once gave me this!

05:24.616 --> 05:28.745
-What is it?
-Uh, hello? It's a floating cube!

05:28.829 --> 05:31.706
[laughs]
Oh, this guy. And watch!

05:31.790 --> 05:34.125
My name is Coran and I'm a gorgeous man.

05:34.209 --> 05:35.043
[beeping]

05:35.126 --> 05:38.296
[Coran's voice]
<i>My name is Coran and I'm a gorgeous man.</i>

05:38.380 --> 05:41.299
Why would a society
full of literal tech wizards

05:41.383 --> 05:43.635
use spores to send a distress signal?

05:43.718 --> 05:46.513
Who cares?
When do we get to see that city?

05:46.596 --> 05:49.683
Actually, Pidge, the distress signal
isn't coming from the city.

05:49.766 --> 05:52.102
It's coming from... the forest.

05:53.270 --> 05:55.021
[gasps]
Oh...

06:02.195 --> 06:05.031
Why doesn't anyone ever send
a distress signal from a cool place?

06:05.115 --> 06:09.035
[Pidge] <i>I hate the outdoors.</i>
<i>Nothing but sunburn and poison oak.</i>

06:09.119 --> 06:12.205
I like it out here. It's quiet.
[gasps]

06:14.624 --> 06:17.586
-What was that?
-Uh, are we being attacked?

06:17.669 --> 06:21.381
I don't know, but something's dragging
my lion down to the surface.

06:21.464 --> 06:24.050
[Lance]
<i>Yeah, something's pulling Blue down, too.</i>

06:34.185 --> 06:36.396
Are those wooden mech suits?

06:36.479 --> 06:40.025
<i>Are you kidding me? We got taken down</i>
<i>by a bunch of tree people!</i>

06:40.942 --> 06:43.778
[Shiro over speaker]
<i>We come in peace!</i>

06:43.862 --> 06:46.698
Could it be? Voltron?

06:49.909 --> 06:51.202
We found your distress signal!

06:53.121 --> 06:57.876
-Praise Lubos!
-[Olkari] Lubos!

06:57.959 --> 07:01.421
[cheering, chanting]
Lubos!

07:01.588 --> 07:05.425
When the Galra attacked,
only a few of us escaped the cities.

07:05.508 --> 07:08.219
We were forced to flee into the forest.

07:08.303 --> 07:11.765
-How long have you lived like this?
-Many decafeebs.

07:11.848 --> 07:15.518
But, as you can see,
our people are resilient.

07:15.602 --> 07:17.729
We never stopped evolving.

07:17.812 --> 07:21.191
Instead, we adapted our skills
to the environment.

07:27.656 --> 07:29.991
[panting]

07:38.917 --> 07:40.126
Coran was right, Ryner.

07:40.210 --> 07:42.837
You really are the most incredible
engineers in the universe.

07:43.505 --> 07:45.840
To be able to switch from working
with precision machinery

07:45.924 --> 07:48.009
to a bunch of sticks!

07:48.093 --> 07:52.097
Nature's designs are superior
to any that we could devise.

07:52.180 --> 07:55.600
No offense, but I'll take
my computer over a tree any day.

07:55.684 --> 07:57.268
You two can talk science later.

07:57.352 --> 08:00.230
Let's assemble Voltron
and get rid of these Galra invaders.

08:00.313 --> 08:05.610
It's not that simple, I'm afraid.
The Galra have our leader, Lubos.

08:05.694 --> 08:06.861
[Olkari]
Lubos...

08:06.945 --> 08:09.656
If you attack, who knows
what they'll do to him?

08:09.739 --> 08:11.491
Then, we'll just have to rescue him.

08:22.752 --> 08:26.172
-[over speaker] <i>Work faster! Faster!</i>
-[Olkari grunting]

08:26.256 --> 08:29.509
For a bunch of slaves
with magical, metalworking powers,

08:29.592 --> 08:33.929
they're taking an awfully long time
to build my super weapon.

08:34.014 --> 08:38.893
Perhaps they need a little bit
of motivation. Show them their king!

08:43.773 --> 08:48.403
<i>No... No more! Please don't hurt me!</i>

08:48.486 --> 08:50.905
-[gasping]
-[sobbing]

08:56.453 --> 08:58.288
That's more like it.

09:00.707 --> 09:04.627
Um... Ryner, where are we?

09:04.711 --> 09:06.171
This is the armory.

09:12.886 --> 09:13.803
Whoa...

09:22.353 --> 09:25.815
-[all scream, gasp]
-[Hunk] Huh?

09:25.899 --> 09:29.736
-Cool!
-Uh, can I get one of those?

09:29.819 --> 09:31.738
[Ryner]
Of course. You can each have one.

09:31.821 --> 09:35.075
Now, the key to operating it
is understanding

09:35.158 --> 09:38.286
that the nanocellulose responds
to electrical impulses

09:38.369 --> 09:41.498
from the neural pathways
connected through this.

09:41.581 --> 09:46.169
-Do what now?
-Mm. Mm! Makes my tongue itchy.

09:46.252 --> 09:48.088
That's your interface?

09:48.171 --> 09:51.591
Of course, all commands need to come
as binary coded messages.

09:53.468 --> 09:54.928
So, like this.

10:11.111 --> 10:15.115
-Yes! Excellent!
-I think mine is just a tree.

10:15.198 --> 10:17.367
You must have
a deep connection with nature.

10:18.159 --> 10:22.080
Not really. My allergies and pale skin
don't mix with outdoor living.

10:22.163 --> 10:25.959
-Pidge is our resident tech expert.
-Well, that explains it.

10:26.042 --> 10:28.920
Like the Olkari, you understand
that, at the deepest level,

10:29.003 --> 10:33.424
trees, metal, you, me...
we're all made up of the same cosmic dust,

10:33.508 --> 10:35.969
all arranged by the laws of mathematics.

10:36.052 --> 10:38.179
Does this mean I should start gardening?

10:38.263 --> 10:42.058
It means you're going to need
to give your friends a ride.

10:43.810 --> 10:48.398
This way! To the edge of the forest!
To save our king!

10:55.405 --> 10:59.075
Finally, the cube is ready for launch.

10:59.159 --> 11:03.746
Load the top Olkari engineers
onto our ships and prepare for departure.

11:04.372 --> 11:07.041
After the cube destroys Olkarion,

11:07.125 --> 11:10.670
hopefully, Zarkon will welcome us
back to the main fleet.

11:16.301 --> 11:18.845
[Ryner] <i>Their headquarters</i>
<i>are impenetrable from the ground,</i>

11:18.928 --> 11:22.181
but there is one way in,
a small opening in the roof.

11:22.265 --> 11:24.559
It goes all the way down
to an open courtyard.

11:24.642 --> 11:25.852
That's quite a drop.

11:25.935 --> 11:28.563
But there you will have
total access to the building.

11:28.646 --> 11:32.150
<i>The hard part will be</i>
<i>getting onto the roof undetected.</i>

11:32.233 --> 11:33.484
[Shiro]
<i>That won't be a problem.</i>

11:34.527 --> 11:38.031
Hey, hey, what's that?
Is that part of the building?

11:38.114 --> 11:40.325
My Lubos! It can't be!

11:40.408 --> 11:42.911
<i>Hey! That looks like the cube</i>
<i>Coran gave me!</i>

11:42.994 --> 11:45.788
I haven't seen one of those
in many decafeebs.

11:45.872 --> 11:47.916
We used to play with them as children.

11:47.999 --> 11:52.921
But this... Only King Lubos
could have designed one that size.

11:53.004 --> 11:54.213
Why would he do that?

11:54.297 --> 11:56.549
They must have forced him
to reveal his designs

11:56.633 --> 11:58.718
and reconstruct it as a weapon.

11:58.801 --> 12:02.305
From the looks of it,
I'd say it's almost finished.

12:02.388 --> 12:06.643
Okay, we need to act fast.
Everyone, back to base. I have a plan.

12:08.269 --> 12:10.563
<i>First, we'll need to get</i>
<i>to the top of that tower.</i>

12:12.357 --> 12:14.317
<i>Since the Green Lion</i>
<i>has stealth capabilities,</i>

12:14.400 --> 12:16.444
<i>Pidge, you're the drop ship.</i>

12:16.527 --> 12:19.280
<i>You'll take Keith, Hunk,</i>
<i>Lance, and me to the roof,</i>

12:19.364 --> 12:20.990
<i>then drop back to a safe position.</i>

12:35.046 --> 12:38.841
<i>After the drop, we'll use a censor to scan</i>
<i>the building for any Olkari biorhythms.</i>

12:41.219 --> 12:42.428
[rapid beeping]

12:55.149 --> 12:57.986
[moaning, sobbing inside]

12:58.069 --> 12:59.404
[sobbing continues]

13:02.073 --> 13:06.411
[sobbing continues]

13:08.079 --> 13:09.163
[Lubos]
Betrayal!

13:09.247 --> 13:12.875
[sobbing]

13:12.959 --> 13:15.837
She loves you!
[sobbing]

13:17.714 --> 13:19.841
King Lubos?

13:19.924 --> 13:23.803
Yes? Who are you?
The jesters I requested?

13:24.345 --> 13:27.140
Um, we're here to, like, rescue you?

13:27.807 --> 13:29.142
Hmm...

13:30.810 --> 13:31.894
[alarm blaring]

13:34.814 --> 13:37.066
You could have just said, "No, thanks."

13:38.026 --> 13:41.404
Looks like someone came
to rescue you, Lubos.

13:42.030 --> 13:45.158
You turned your back on your people
to save your own skin?

13:45.241 --> 13:47.535
I'm doing this for my people!

13:47.618 --> 13:51.247
They wanted to fight the Galra,
but they are too powerful!

13:51.330 --> 13:53.666
The Galra could destroy us!

13:53.750 --> 13:56.753
So, you helped enslave your people
to build some super weapon?

13:56.836 --> 14:00.256
Don't make me the bad guy!
He forced me to do it!

14:00.339 --> 14:02.258
Did he force-feed you, too?

14:02.341 --> 14:03.843
Uh...

14:05.553 --> 14:07.430
You're no king.

14:07.513 --> 14:10.058
[whimpers, groans]

14:10.141 --> 14:14.854
Okay, we're walking out of here!
Anyone tries to stop us and Lubos gets it!

14:14.937 --> 14:17.523
-Whoa, K-Keith!
-That came out of nowhere!

14:17.607 --> 14:20.068
La-sai, what are you doing?

14:20.151 --> 14:24.113
You betrayed our people.
I can't live this lie anymore.

14:24.197 --> 14:26.824
You don't want me to hurt
your genius engineer, right?

14:26.908 --> 14:31.412
Oh, be my guest. His work is done.
The cube is complete.

14:31.496 --> 14:35.083
What? But-But I thought we had a deal!

14:35.166 --> 14:38.378
Guards, put them all out of their misery.

14:38.461 --> 14:39.837
[all scream]

14:39.921 --> 14:42.507
[grunting, coughing]

14:42.590 --> 14:43.966
[Pidge]
<i>Your ride is here!</i>

14:44.717 --> 14:47.553
Engage the cube! Take down the lion!

14:47.637 --> 14:48.888
[all panting]

14:52.392 --> 14:53.643
[both grunt]

14:56.562 --> 14:57.814
[Shiro]
<i>The cube is operational!</i>

14:57.897 --> 15:00.316
<i>We've got to get back</i>
<i>to the other lions and form Voltron!</i>

15:00.400 --> 15:01.317
[Pidge]
<i>On it!</i>

15:04.862 --> 15:06.239
-[groans]
-[Olkari gasp]

15:06.322 --> 15:10.076
[Olkari murmuring]
Lubos...

15:10.159 --> 15:11.661
What's going on?

15:11.744 --> 15:13.413
While your countrymen starved,

15:13.496 --> 15:15.998
King Lubos was well
taken care of by the Galra.

15:16.624 --> 15:18.501
He willingly helped them
build that cube,

15:18.584 --> 15:21.170
willingly helped
to enslave his own people.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.506
-[all gasp]
-Lubos...

15:23.589 --> 15:28.845
I know you're devastated, but it's time
to be strong and use your Olkari spirit

15:28.928 --> 15:32.473
to fight alongside Voltron
and take back your planet!

15:34.225 --> 15:36.978
Lubos, how could you?

15:37.562 --> 15:41.941
-I... I was only trying to--
-Enough! We must free our people!

15:42.024 --> 15:44.569
[Olkari cheering]

15:45.403 --> 15:46.487
[roars]

16:04.213 --> 16:05.047
[roars]

16:15.850 --> 16:18.394
[Shiro] <i>All right, team,</i>
<i>let's take that thing down!</i>

16:23.858 --> 16:25.234
<i>Form shield!</i>

16:27.111 --> 16:30.031
Let's see how tough this magic cube is.

16:35.786 --> 16:37.288
Did it just absorb our lasers?

16:37.371 --> 16:40.082
We need to increase firepower!
Hunk, use your blaster!

16:40.166 --> 16:42.084
-I'm not sure this is a good idea.
-Got it!

16:50.426 --> 16:51.761
Yeah, I think it's working!

17:03.439 --> 17:07.359
It's giving back whatever we fire into it,
like Coran's echo cube.

17:07.443 --> 17:10.320
That's what I was trying
to tell you guys! It's learning!

17:10.404 --> 17:13.866
<i>Making its own versions</i>
<i>of our weapons to use against us!</i>

17:14.450 --> 17:16.452
[Lance] <i>We can't just sit here.</i>
<i>We've got to move!</i>

17:17.036 --> 17:19.288
[all scream]

17:27.713 --> 17:28.881
[Hunk]
<i>How do we beat it?</i>

17:28.965 --> 17:31.592
Maybe, if we form our sword,
we can cut through the surface

17:31.676 --> 17:34.720
and hack right into the center
thinking point place?

17:34.804 --> 17:37.014
Can't be any worse
than what's happening now.

17:37.098 --> 17:39.100
Let's do it. Form sword!

17:49.819 --> 17:50.653
[Pidge]
<i>It's working!</i>

17:51.946 --> 17:54.073
It's still operational! Re-engage!

17:56.659 --> 17:59.078
[Hunk]
<i>We did it! They're going down!</i>

18:02.915 --> 18:03.749
[Lance]
<i>Uh-oh!</i>

18:06.377 --> 18:08.337
[Shiro]
<i>We've got to move! Move!</i>

18:13.426 --> 18:18.014
[grunts] We can't fight them like this!
We need to split up! Back into lions!

18:18.097 --> 18:22.268
Excellent. Voltron doesn't stand
a chance against my weapon.

18:22.351 --> 18:28.107
Soon, I'll have both the cube and Voltron
to present to Emperor Zarkon.

18:28.190 --> 18:30.526
<i>Let's see if I can freeze these guys!</i>

18:35.781 --> 18:38.200
Oh, no! So cold, so cold!

18:39.201 --> 18:42.413
<i>-Oh, oh. Thanks, Keith.</i>
<i>-You got it.</i>

18:44.290 --> 18:45.791
Shiro, what are we going to do?

18:45.875 --> 18:47.835
There doesn't seem
to be any way to stop them,

18:47.918 --> 18:50.379
but we can't let this weapon
get into Zarkon's hands!

18:51.505 --> 18:53.924
-[screams]
<i>-Pidge!</i>

18:55.843 --> 18:57.720
The Green Lion's in trouble!

18:58.929 --> 19:01.140
[Hunk]
<i>Pidge! Are you okay?</i>

19:03.601 --> 19:06.312
[groaning]

19:06.395 --> 19:10.441
-[Ryner] <i>Pidge, can you hear me?</i>
-Yeah. Wait.

19:10.524 --> 19:13.861
-<i>How am I hearing you?</i>
-That's not important right now.

19:13.944 --> 19:16.530
We need to get your lion
back up and running.

19:17.114 --> 19:19.325
I think we can heal your lion's body,

19:19.408 --> 19:22.703
but you must bond with its spirit
if it is to fly again.

19:22.787 --> 19:26.415
-But I thought we bonded already.
-<i>Your bond must be stronger.</i>

19:27.958 --> 19:30.294
Come on, girl. I need you.

19:31.253 --> 19:36.092
Remember what I said.
You, the lion, the Olkari...

19:36.175 --> 19:39.178
We are all made of the same essence.

19:39.261 --> 19:42.515
[Shiro]
<i>Where are you, Pidge? We need you!</i>

19:42.598 --> 19:45.935
-[all groaning, grunting]
-[Keith] <i>Pidge!</i>

19:46.018 --> 19:47.687
-[groaning continues]
<i>-Pidge!</i>

20:11.961 --> 20:14.380
<i>-Guys, hang on!</i>
-[all] Pidge!

20:16.090 --> 20:18.509
[Hunk] <i>Whoa, Pidge!</i>
<i>What's going on? You're booking!</i>

20:18.592 --> 20:22.138
I'm not sure, but I feel more connected
with my lion than ever!

20:22.221 --> 20:24.056
<i>I know what I have to do!</i>

20:25.349 --> 20:26.183
[roars]

20:34.191 --> 20:36.318
Whoa! How'd you do that?

20:37.153 --> 20:39.822
That's right! Circle up, everybody!
Get some of this!

20:59.258 --> 21:01.343
[chuckles]
Vines...

21:01.427 --> 21:04.889
Well, that is not the way I thought
a giant cube of death would go down.

21:05.806 --> 21:06.807
No!

21:09.268 --> 21:11.312
Commander, we have to evacuate.

21:11.395 --> 21:14.565
<i>The cube is down,</i>
<i>and the Olkari have taken back the city.</i>

21:16.400 --> 21:17.318
[growls]

21:17.401 --> 21:19.111
[all cheering]

21:21.280 --> 21:24.950
I want to thank you all.
You helped us get our home back.

21:25.034 --> 21:27.912
And, for that, we will never
be able to repay you.

21:27.995 --> 21:30.956
Just promise me that when it's time
to take the fight to Zarkon,

21:31.040 --> 21:33.000
we can count on the Olkari for help.

21:33.083 --> 21:35.002
Now and forever.

21:35.669 --> 21:39.632
And you...
The spirit of the Olkari resides in you.

21:39.715 --> 21:43.385
The bond between you and your lion
has grown stronger than ever.

21:44.220 --> 21:47.973
Without you, I would never have been
able to unlock my lion's hidden power.

21:50.684 --> 21:53.479
-[Shiro] Nice job, Pidge.
-You know, it's weird.

21:53.562 --> 21:56.649
I've always been a tech junkie.
That's how I connected with the world.

21:57.274 --> 22:01.570
But, for the first time,
I feel connected to everything.

22:01.654 --> 22:05.991
I guess it's like Ryner said.
We're all made up of the same cosmic dust.

22:06.075 --> 22:09.745
So, that means we're all related.

22:09.829 --> 22:13.541
This ship, those stars, the Olkari.

22:13.624 --> 22:14.917
Even the Galra.

22:15.668 --> 22:19.129
Uh-oh. I think Keith
just blew his own mind.

22:19.213 --> 22:22.883
-[all laugh]
-[Hunk] What?

22:22.967 --> 22:27.054
Well, that was a productive trip.
Look at all these cubes they gave me!

22:27.137 --> 22:31.684
-Coran, Coran, the gorgeous man!
-<i>Coran, Coran, the gorgeous man!</i>

22:31.767 --> 22:35.271
-Ah, sounds pretty good.
-<i>Ah, sounds pretty good.</i>

22:35.354 --> 22:37.273
[makes fart noise]

22:37.356 --> 22:38.941
[fart noise echoing]

22:39.024 --> 22:41.110
-[all laughing, gasping]
-[Hunk] Whoa!

22:41.193 --> 22:43.112
-[Coran] What's that?
-<i>What's that?</i>

22:46.532 --> 22:50.286
<i>-Oh, no!</i>
<i>-Oh, no!</i>
