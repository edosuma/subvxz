00:04.900 --> 00:06.400
My stop's right over there.

00:07.620 --> 00:08.790
Don't miss this one.

00:10.640 --> 00:11.830
Bye.

00:11.880 --> 00:13.200
- Bye.
- Ciao!

00:20.320 --> 00:21.750
Wait!

[Police.]

00:45.760 --> 00:47.110
Let me go!

00:47.160 --> 00:48.710
No!

00:48.760 --> 00:50.670
No, no! Let me go!

00:50.720 --> 00:51.760
Let me go!

00:54.760 --> 00:56.160
Let me go!

01:22.680 --> 01:24.630
I'll get that, shall I?

01:24.680 --> 01:27.240
Have you even done your
homework yet, Ollie?

01:29.040 --> 01:31.150
- Hello. - Sorry to trouble
you at home, ma'am,

01:31.200 --> 01:34.110
but we've just picked up a bystander
triple-9 on an active abduction

01:34.160 --> 01:36.950
- of a young female in the Moss Heath area.
- They've got all-patrol obs?

01:37.000 --> 01:38.790
Yes, ma'am, they're definitely doing that.

01:38.840 --> 01:40.630
Make sure obs goes out
to surrounding forces.

01:40.680 --> 01:42.270
I'll patch in en route. I'm coming in.

01:42.320 --> 01:44.110
Sorry to have called you at home, ma'am.

01:44.160 --> 01:46.670
No, this is what we needed.

01:46.720 --> 01:48.550
We've being looking for him for months.

01:48.600 --> 01:50.310
We're going to get this bastard, yeah?

01:50.360 --> 01:52.070
- Come on, let's go!
- Go, go, go!

01:52.120 --> 01:53.470
Nick, where are you?

01:53.520 --> 01:54.790
Sorry, last meeting overran.

01:54.840 --> 01:56.710
I just got the call and you're not home!

01:56.760 --> 02:00.150
- I'm literally ten minutes away.
- OK, the kids are waiting for you.

02:00.200 --> 02:01.640
And I put the bins out.

02:24.760 --> 02:26.630
Ma'am.

02:26.680 --> 02:28.430
DCI Huntley.

02:28.480 --> 02:31.350
- Is it the vehicle?
- Yes, ma'am, reported stolen this morning.

02:31.400 --> 02:33.630
The bystander that witnessed
the abduction described

02:33.680 --> 02:36.350
a suspect of average height and
build, wearing a dark balaclava.

02:36.400 --> 02:37.950
It's him, he could be right here.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.070
- Yes, ma'am. - OK, let's get
a decision log up and running.

02:41.120 --> 02:45.270
Cordons established, with time, SO
DCI Huntley arrives, takes command

02:45.320 --> 02:47.620
of initial scene management, with time.

02:49.840 --> 02:52.550
- Sorry, boss.
- Anyone see the driver, passenger?

02:52.600 --> 02:54.790
Just done a sweep, boss.
No witnesses as yet.

02:54.840 --> 02:56.340
Missed him by minutes.

02:59.840 --> 03:01.160
Christ! News travels.

03:05.440 --> 03:07.830
Come on, come on, let's
start house-to-house.

03:07.880 --> 03:09.830
- Ma'am. - Get a pair of
GPDs. - OK, guys, with me.

03:09.880 --> 03:11.990
House-to-house and GPDs, note start time.

03:12.040 --> 03:15.040
Delta X-ray 8912. Dog unit,
please, Borogrove Estate.

03:18.120 --> 03:19.990
Have you seen a young woman accompanied by

03:20.040 --> 03:21.910
a man who might have
been wearing a balaclava?

03:21.960 --> 03:24.710
Detective Chief Inspector Huntley,
sorry to disturb your evening.

03:24.760 --> 03:26.950
We're conducting house-to-house
enquiries relating

03:27.000 --> 03:29.390
to a vehicle found abandoned
on the estate that may have been

03:29.440 --> 03:31.230
involved in the abduction
of a young woman.

03:31.280 --> 03:33.600
Boss! Boss! The dogs are on to something!

03:56.040 --> 03:57.360
Pull the dogs back.

03:58.600 --> 04:00.270
Neil, get Control.

04:00.320 --> 04:03.270
Delta X-ray, stand by for an active
message from Delta X-ray Zero Two.

04:03.320 --> 04:05.230
'Delta X-ray received.

04:05.280 --> 04:07.550
This is SIO on the Trapdoor
search currently ongoing on the

04:07.600 --> 04:08.840
Borogrove Estate.

04:10.760 --> 04:12.870
- Get back!
- Are you all right?

04:15.760 --> 04:16.800
Round the back!

04:17.880 --> 04:19.870
We can't lose him! He was right here!

04:19.920 --> 04:22.390
Neil, get the dogs down there,
he could have made a run for it!

04:22.440 --> 04:23.800
Help!

04:26.320 --> 04:27.360
Help!

04:34.200 --> 04:35.470
Get the cutters!

04:35.520 --> 04:38.310
Listen to me, we're going to
get you free. What's your name?

04:38.360 --> 04:39.480
It's Hana.

04:45.240 --> 04:46.750
Come on!

04:46.800 --> 04:48.040
Cutters, ma'am!

05:02.520 --> 05:05.990
- The ambulance will be
here in a minute. - Perfect.

05:06.040 --> 05:09.590
Constable, will you record
this on your body-cam?

05:09.640 --> 05:12.310
Hana, can you give us a
description of your attacker?

05:12.360 --> 05:14.550
No, I never saw his face.

05:14.600 --> 05:15.830
He wore a...

05:15.880 --> 05:17.510
A balacla...?

05:17.560 --> 05:19.310
Something covering his face?

05:19.360 --> 05:23.150
Yes, like, dark, with
two holes for the eyes.

05:23.200 --> 05:26.670
What did his voice sound
like? Accent, etc?

05:26.720 --> 05:29.590
Um, he never spoke.

05:29.640 --> 05:31.550
What happened to your ears?

05:31.600 --> 05:33.910
He tore out my earrings.

05:33.960 --> 05:35.110
All right. Thank you, Hana.

05:35.160 --> 05:38.240
The paramedics are going to
take very good care of you.

05:40.360 --> 05:42.710
Boss, no sign of him in the back alley.

05:42.760 --> 05:44.710
- Dogs are still out there.
- Right.

05:44.760 --> 05:46.950
Let's lock down all exit
roads in a one-mile radius,

05:47.000 --> 05:48.870
put out all patrol obs on our suspect

05:48.920 --> 05:50.590
and find out whose house this is.

05:50.640 --> 05:51.680
Yes, ma'am.

05:53.760 --> 05:55.760
Tim Ifield, Forensic Coordinator.

06:02.240 --> 06:03.750
Hey, Tim.

06:03.800 --> 06:07.230
Listen, I'm not being funny,
but that scene log has got

06:07.280 --> 06:08.990
every Tom, Dick and Harry going.

06:09.040 --> 06:12.150
Your officers, they're traipsing
all over every blade of grass

06:12.200 --> 06:14.710
before MY team's had a
chance to secure evidence.

06:14.760 --> 06:18.110
This is a live search for a
suspect and THAT takes priority.

06:18.160 --> 06:20.350
I'll send you in to do an
initial survey the moment the

06:20.400 --> 06:22.070
FARS OIC declare the building safe.

06:22.120 --> 06:23.630
Fine, yeah, ready when you are.

06:23.680 --> 06:25.870
And I'll need one of your
FIs to process the witness.

06:25.920 --> 06:28.750
Yeah, that's what we're here for.

06:28.800 --> 06:31.910
Ma'am, electoral roll gives
residents as Eileen Farmer,

06:31.960 --> 06:35.590
born 1946, and Michael Farmer, born 1993.

06:35.640 --> 06:37.670
Neighbours say they haven't
seen Eileen for ages.

06:37.720 --> 06:40.230
And Michael, the grandson,
they describe him as a loner,

06:40.280 --> 06:41.710
rarely seen out on the estate.

06:41.760 --> 06:45.070
PNCd Michael Farmer. He's on
the Sex Offenders Register.

06:45.120 --> 06:46.440
Bingo.

07:06.880 --> 07:08.270
Hold the line, please.

07:08.320 --> 07:10.430
Michael Farmer just clocked
on for the night shift.

07:10.480 --> 07:11.750
Just too late for an alibi.

07:11.800 --> 07:13.830
Right, well, we can take my car, ma'am.

07:13.880 --> 07:16.510
No, no-one who's been at the crime
scene can have any contact with

07:16.560 --> 07:19.310
- Michael Farmer until he's been fully
forensically processed. - Right.

07:19.360 --> 07:22.030
No way some smart arse defence
barrister's going to get to confuse

07:22.080 --> 07:25.310
a jury about cross-contamination
of forensic evidence.

07:25.360 --> 07:28.270
Please do nothing to alert Mr Farmer.

07:28.320 --> 07:31.720
Police officers will be
arriving in the next few minutes.

07:38.320 --> 07:39.870
Which one's Michael?

07:39.920 --> 07:41.160
He's down there.

07:42.880 --> 07:45.390
Michael Farmer, I'm arresting
you on suspicion of abduction

07:45.440 --> 07:46.760
and attempted murder.

07:48.520 --> 07:51.590
- Stop! - Received Delta
Charlie Two Zero. - Stop!

07:51.640 --> 07:53.540
We have a male making off from us.

07:55.720 --> 07:57.040
Hold it, mate, hold it!

07:58.320 --> 07:59.990
Calm down, calm down.

08:00.040 --> 08:01.310
'Delta Charlie Two-Zero.

08:01.360 --> 08:03.390
Are you in position for
an update on the suspect?

08:03.440 --> 08:06.950
Delta Charlie Two-Zero, one under
arrest identified as Michael Farmer.

08:07.000 --> 08:10.390
Confirmed. One under arrest
identified as Michael Farmer.

08:10.440 --> 08:13.950
Forensic deployment en
route. Suspect is cooperating.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.080
Michael, why did you run
from our arresting officers?

08:19.320 --> 08:20.840
I was frightened.

08:22.600 --> 08:24.350
Please can you help us with where you were

08:24.400 --> 08:26.200
between 8pm and 10pm last night?

08:32.400 --> 08:34.110
I went to visit my nan.

08:34.159 --> 08:36.909
Which would be where, please, Michael?

08:36.960 --> 08:38.480
At the nursing home.

08:39.760 --> 08:41.429
How long did you stay

08:41.480 --> 08:43.480
at the nursing home, please, Michael?

08:44.600 --> 08:47.230
Half-past seven till half-past eight.

08:47.280 --> 08:48.350
Visiting time.

08:48.400 --> 08:50.400
And then where did you go, Michael?

08:51.760 --> 08:53.150
Nowhere.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.830
Can you help us with what you
mean by "nowhere", please, Michael?

08:55.880 --> 08:59.830
After visiting Nan, I go and eat
me sandwiches and have me drink.

08:59.880 --> 09:01.680
Where did you do that, Michael?

09:03.520 --> 09:05.950
Sat on a wall.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.400
Why didn't you stay with your nan instead?

09:10.520 --> 09:11.840
You're not allowed...

09:13.240 --> 09:14.990
.. after half-past eight.

09:15.040 --> 09:18.190
If you had your phone with you, that
could help prove your whereabouts.

09:18.240 --> 09:23.590
Unfortunately, Mr Farmer's
phone isn't a smartphone.

09:23.640 --> 09:26.710
But surely, Mr Morganstaff, you
realise that you can locate

09:26.760 --> 09:30.520
any mobile SIM via triangulation
of relative signal strength.

09:34.720 --> 09:36.160
Yeah.

09:37.600 --> 09:39.800
Would you like to take a break, Michael?

09:42.120 --> 09:43.920
Ah, Roz, I'm glad I caught you.

09:46.240 --> 09:48.350
Tim, they're about to go
back in with the suspect.

09:48.400 --> 09:51.150
About to. Now, these appear to
have been the most significant find

09:51.200 --> 09:53.870
- at the crime scene.
- I'm up to speed on the forensics.

09:53.920 --> 09:56.430
There's a very subtle point
you've probably missed.

09:56.480 --> 09:58.470
Trust me, I haven't.

09:58.520 --> 10:00.950
Boss, the duty solicitor says
Farmer's ready to carry on.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.070
Great. Thanks, Neil.

10:03.120 --> 10:04.840
Tim, e-mail me your concerns.

10:06.600 --> 10:07.630
I know my place.

10:07.680 --> 10:09.990
Tim, I will read them.

10:10.040 --> 10:11.360
Absolutely.

10:19.360 --> 10:21.080
What was all that about, boss?

10:35.520 --> 10:36.760
As you were.

10:50.800 --> 10:52.710
Is DCI Huntley, um...?

10:52.760 --> 10:54.510
Expecting me? No.

10:54.560 --> 10:55.960
As you were.

11:00.240 --> 11:01.550
That'll be all.

11:01.600 --> 11:04.110
So from half-past eight
to a quarter to ten,

11:04.160 --> 11:06.750
- you were just sitting
on a wall? - Yes.

11:06.800 --> 11:08.630
Where was the wall?

11:08.680 --> 11:09.830
Sir.

11:09.880 --> 11:11.630
I can't remember.

11:11.680 --> 11:14.840
Did anybody see you while you
were sitting on this wall?

11:16.360 --> 11:17.710
I don't think so.

11:17.760 --> 11:19.670
Anything?

11:19.720 --> 11:22.030
Convicted sex offender.

11:22.080 --> 11:24.670
We're just hearing now he has
nothing in way of an alibi.

11:24.720 --> 11:26.110
Good.

11:26.160 --> 11:29.030
You were on this wall for over an hour,

11:29.080 --> 11:31.080
but you can't remember where it was?

11:35.640 --> 11:37.070
No.

11:37.120 --> 11:39.870
Right, OK.

11:39.920 --> 11:42.670
Think we'll be able to charge
him within the 36 hours?

11:42.720 --> 11:45.510
Was there anybody there with you?

11:45.560 --> 11:47.950
There's a lot of evidence to go through.

11:48.000 --> 11:53.110
You're right to be meticulous,
but we need a breakthrough.

11:53.160 --> 11:56.470
They've been killing us on Twitter.

11:56.520 --> 11:59.390
There hasn't been a single moment
I've regretted my choice of SIO.

11:59.440 --> 12:01.750
Think very carefully, please, Michael.

12:01.800 --> 12:03.230
Thank you, sir.

12:03.280 --> 12:05.030
But I've stuck my neck out.

12:05.080 --> 12:07.870
Plenty would have taken
you off this case by now.

12:07.920 --> 12:10.150
There wasn't a young woman there?

12:10.200 --> 12:11.600
- No.
- You sure?

12:14.880 --> 12:16.310
Yes.

12:16.360 --> 12:17.630
I have every confidence in you.

12:17.680 --> 12:21.630
There's something else we
want to talk about, a fire.

12:21.680 --> 12:23.870
What can you tell us about that?

12:23.920 --> 12:27.110
A fire, in your house, Michael.

12:27.160 --> 12:29.390
- A big fire.
- I don't know.

12:29.440 --> 12:31.710
So you're saying you had nothing to do

12:31.760 --> 12:33.360
with this fire?

12:35.080 --> 12:36.120
No.

12:38.360 --> 12:40.840
I'm going to show you
some photographs now.

12:42.320 --> 12:44.550
Baswinder Kaur.

12:44.600 --> 12:47.590
Her dismembered body was found
on the 11th of November.

12:47.640 --> 12:49.590
A hairgrip.

12:49.640 --> 12:52.120
Ever seen either of these before, Michael?

12:57.440 --> 12:58.480
I'm not sure.

13:00.400 --> 13:02.510
Leonie Collersdale.

13:02.560 --> 13:05.520
Last seen 25th of January.
No-one's seen her since.

13:07.600 --> 13:08.800
A necklace.

13:09.960 --> 13:12.310
Seen this or Leonie before?

13:14.520 --> 13:15.760
I'm not sure.

13:17.400 --> 13:19.600
Hana Reznikova abducted last night.

13:20.680 --> 13:22.550
Her earrings.

13:22.600 --> 13:24.670
Have you seen them before?

13:24.720 --> 13:26.000
I'm not sure.

13:28.840 --> 13:32.280
- Is this you, Michael?
- This is very important, Michael.

13:33.520 --> 13:35.550
Please, think carefully.

13:35.600 --> 13:38.790
This is a photo of a man
captured on the evening

13:38.840 --> 13:42.190
of the 25th of January
when Leonie disappeared.

13:42.240 --> 13:43.640
Could this be you at all?

13:49.280 --> 13:50.680
I'm not sure.

13:54.040 --> 13:56.430
A 24-year-old man has
been charged in connection

13:56.480 --> 13:59.030
with the murder of Baswinder Kaur,

13:59.080 --> 14:02.230
the disappearance of Leonie Collersdale

14:02.280 --> 14:06.230
and the abduction and attempted
murder of a third woman.

14:06.280 --> 14:08.470
The third victim was
rescued from an address

14:08.520 --> 14:11.270
in the Moss Heath area late last night.

14:11.320 --> 14:14.750
She's currently safe and well
and assisting our inquiry.

14:14.800 --> 14:18.030
Baswinder Kaur's dismembered body
was found in November last year,

14:18.080 --> 14:20.910
with Leonie Collersdale's
disappearance also in the

14:20.960 --> 14:23.150
Moss Heath area ten weeks later.

14:23.200 --> 14:25.670
Police quickly suspected
there was a connection.

14:25.720 --> 14:28.630
The hunt for the suspect,
code-named Operation Trapdoor,

14:28.680 --> 14:30.950
had made scant progress until now.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.230
"Until now!"

14:32.280 --> 14:34.850
I want to thank members of...

14:35.400 --> 14:37.550
And my officers for
their courageous actions

14:37.600 --> 14:41.430
in rescuing this young woman
from a terrifying ordeal.

14:41.480 --> 14:43.190
I would also like to pay tribute...

14:43.240 --> 14:45.390
Well done, everyone.
Great work. Well done.

14:45.440 --> 14:47.750
- Thanks, boss.
- Thanks, ma'am.

14:47.800 --> 14:50.350
They've worked tirelessly during
these dark months to crack this

14:50.400 --> 14:52.470
most challenging case.

14:52.520 --> 14:56.110
And, finally, at this time,
our thoughts are with the

14:56.160 --> 14:59.590
families of the two young women,
who are the tragic victims

14:59.640 --> 15:01.510
of these senseless crimes.

15:01.560 --> 15:03.590
They should throw away the key.

15:03.640 --> 15:06.990
Full marks to the ACC for
his Crimewatch audition.

15:07.040 --> 15:09.510
All right, everybody. Come on.

15:09.560 --> 15:10.680
Back to work.

15:12.960 --> 15:15.880
Hello, Superintendent Hastings, AC-12.

15:37.880 --> 15:38.960
Roz?

15:41.920 --> 15:43.000
Roz?

15:54.000 --> 15:55.040
Hey.

16:00.760 --> 16:01.800
I heard the news.

16:03.560 --> 16:05.310
Sorry about last night.

16:05.360 --> 16:06.560
If I'd known...

16:07.920 --> 16:09.120
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

16:10.440 --> 16:11.840
Hey, what's wrong?

16:13.720 --> 16:14.760
Nothing.

16:16.320 --> 16:17.830
The opposite.

16:17.880 --> 16:19.200
It's over.

16:21.200 --> 16:22.440
Finally...

16:23.920 --> 16:25.120
.. it's over.

16:36.720 --> 16:39.510
Sorry, Sarge, I know you're
just heading out the door.

16:39.560 --> 16:40.870
What's up?

16:40.920 --> 16:43.910
There's someone down in
reception wants to talk to you.

16:43.960 --> 16:45.270
To AC-12?

16:45.320 --> 16:47.110
No, he said only DS Arnott.

16:47.160 --> 16:49.460
Won't give a name, won't
say what it's about.

17:16.079 --> 17:18.390
OK, the case against Michael Farmer.

17:18.440 --> 17:20.710
The crucial finding at the crime scene was

17:20.760 --> 17:22.710
a collection of three items.

17:22.760 --> 17:25.470
Now, the third victim,
the one who was rescued,

17:25.520 --> 17:29.830
told officers that the suspect
forcibly removed her earrings.

17:29.880 --> 17:33.150
Now, these earrings were identified
by the victim as belonging

17:33.200 --> 17:35.200
to her, and the blood matched hers.

17:36.600 --> 17:38.190
That seems pretty sound to me.

17:38.240 --> 17:39.990
It does, DS Arnott.

17:40.040 --> 17:43.470
Significantly, highly
significantly, these earrings were

17:43.520 --> 17:47.030
supposedly kept with items
belonging to the previous victims.

17:47.080 --> 17:48.790
Why supposedly?

17:48.840 --> 17:50.760
How forensically minded are you?

17:51.760 --> 17:52.990
I manage OK.

17:53.040 --> 17:55.510
Because some officers, honestly,
they think the forensics

17:55.560 --> 17:58.190
are cut-and-dried. But, let me tell
you, that is not always the case.

17:58.240 --> 18:01.830
Forensics have to be
interpreted carefully.

18:01.880 --> 18:04.750
I mean, in court, a
so-called expert pops up

18:04.800 --> 18:06.990
and the jury stops listening
to the rest of the evidence.

18:07.040 --> 18:08.400
Look, Tim, it's late.

18:10.320 --> 18:13.030
So, I asked the submissions team
at the laboratory to carry out

18:13.080 --> 18:15.590
a simple environmental
profile on these items.

18:15.640 --> 18:17.710
Other items recovered
from the crime scene --

18:17.760 --> 18:20.670
a hairgrip belonging to Baswinder Kaur

18:20.720 --> 18:23.670
and a necklace belonging
to Leonie Collersdale

18:23.720 --> 18:26.950
bore a characteristic pattern
of carpet fibre deposits.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.550
Now, as residents walk around...

18:28.600 --> 18:30.710
Tiny amounts of carpet
fibres are thrown into the air

18:30.760 --> 18:32.670
and settle on objects in
the immediate vicinity.

18:32.720 --> 18:34.950
This gives an indication of
how long the objects have been

18:35.000 --> 18:36.430
in said location.

18:36.480 --> 18:38.030
Exactly.

18:38.080 --> 18:41.470
No carpet fibre deposits were
found on any of the items

18:41.520 --> 18:44.230
connecting the crime scene
to the previous victims.

18:44.280 --> 18:46.670
None of the suspect's DNA either.

18:46.720 --> 18:48.310
Now, I'm worried...

18:48.360 --> 18:50.470
Well, you know what I'm worried about.

18:50.520 --> 18:52.320
That they were planted there.

18:56.280 --> 18:57.870
One more thing.

18:57.920 --> 19:02.070
All shoe prints in the house matched
footwear seized from the resident

19:02.120 --> 19:05.190
of the house, apart from this one.

19:05.240 --> 19:07.870
It's a boot print that doesn't
relate to him or to anyone

19:07.920 --> 19:10.390
who attended the crime scene
after the scene was cordoned off

19:10.440 --> 19:11.990
for forensic deployment.

19:12.040 --> 19:17.910
Someone else was in the house
around the time of the offence.

19:17.960 --> 19:21.030
Why haven't you taken all
this to the SIO on Trapdoor?

19:21.080 --> 19:22.430
DCI Huntley?

19:22.480 --> 19:25.150
I tried. God knows, I tried.

19:25.200 --> 19:28.350
Evidence may have been planted,
evidence may have been suppressed.

19:28.400 --> 19:30.430
The man they've charged
could well be innocent.

19:30.480 --> 19:35.240
And I've come to you because, well,
you're AC-12, this is what you do.

19:39.520 --> 19:41.750
Timothy Ifield, forensic coordinator,

19:41.800 --> 19:45.470
15 years' experience as an FI,
promoted to Grade G two years ago

19:45.520 --> 19:47.830
on the back of first-class
performance reviews.

19:47.880 --> 19:50.550
He came to us to report
concerns about an investigation

19:50.600 --> 19:53.510
- led by DCI Roz Huntley.
- Operation Trapdoor.

19:53.560 --> 19:55.350
He came to me, actually, sir.

19:55.400 --> 19:56.550
Huntley's got no history

19:56.600 --> 19:58.470
of misconduct or corruption allegations.

19:58.520 --> 19:59.790
None of her team do either.

19:59.840 --> 20:02.110
And on the database, none of
them show any previous link

20:02.160 --> 20:04.630
- to the suspect. - Michael
Farmer? - Yes, sir.

20:04.680 --> 20:07.110
Farmer's a convicted sex
offender, who allegedly abducted

20:07.160 --> 20:09.790
a young woman in Moss Heath and
left her to die in a burning house.

20:09.840 --> 20:13.110
And at his home, trophies were found
linking to the previous victims.

20:13.160 --> 20:16.350
Tim Ifield claims that DCI Huntley
disregarded forensic evidence

20:16.400 --> 20:18.390
that casts doubt on
Michael Farmer's guilt.

20:18.440 --> 20:21.150
Bearing in mind, sir, Huntley must
have discussed the evidence with

20:21.200 --> 20:22.950
other officers, he must have presented it

20:23.000 --> 20:25.070
- to the Crown Prosecutor.
- Well, we can't know details

20:25.120 --> 20:28.070
- until we start digging, sir.
- Right.

20:28.120 --> 20:31.910
Sir, how we treat Tim Ifield's
claims speaks volumes about anyone

20:31.960 --> 20:34.670
that witnesses corruption or is
in two minds about coming forward.

20:34.720 --> 20:36.470
See what happens when you become a DS?

20:36.520 --> 20:38.430
You start worrying how things look.

20:38.480 --> 20:40.310
Hang the finer points.

20:40.360 --> 20:43.030
A young lad might go to prison
for a crime he didn't commit.

20:43.080 --> 20:46.070
And if police wrongdoing is
part of it, I want to know.

20:46.120 --> 20:47.400
Sir.

20:53.040 --> 20:54.390
That could've gone better.

20:54.440 --> 20:56.430
My promotion shouldn't be an issue, Steve.

20:56.480 --> 20:58.230
All I mean is, next time
let's get our ducks in

20:58.280 --> 20:59.670
a row before we talk to the gaffer.

20:59.720 --> 21:02.040
You're not getting any argument from me.

21:16.440 --> 21:17.670
Sorry, ma'am.

21:17.720 --> 21:20.630
There's a DS here from East Mids,
says you should know all about it.

21:20.680 --> 21:21.830
All about what?

21:21.880 --> 21:23.200
Sorry, ma'am.

21:24.360 --> 21:25.720
- Where?
- Incident Room.

21:32.680 --> 21:35.440
- Neil, I'll take those.
- Cheers, boss. - Thank you.

21:39.160 --> 21:40.430
DCI Huntley.

21:40.480 --> 21:43.630
DS Kate Flynn. Congratulations
on closing the case, ma'am.

21:43.680 --> 21:45.110
Great job.

21:45.160 --> 21:46.830
Thank you.

21:46.880 --> 21:49.070
I'm afraid you've caught me unawares.

21:49.120 --> 21:51.910
Oh, sorry, ma'am. I thought
the liaison had been agreed.

21:51.960 --> 21:53.630
It's news to me.

21:53.680 --> 21:56.150
I'm Missing Persons over
at East Mids, looking into a

21:56.200 --> 21:59.790
disappearance with similarities with
the first two victims in your case.

21:59.840 --> 22:02.110
Like yours, she's got juvenile offences

22:02.160 --> 22:04.430
and on-off history of prostitution.

22:04.480 --> 22:06.950
Everything we've put out to the
public has played down those

22:07.000 --> 22:09.910
girls' difficult upbringings,
at my insistence.

22:09.960 --> 22:12.390
Prostitution is not a
factor in these cases.

22:12.440 --> 22:14.830
The victims could have been any woman.

22:14.880 --> 22:17.710
No-one at this station calls
those girls prostitutes.

22:17.760 --> 22:19.590
We call them Baswinder and Leonie.

22:19.640 --> 22:21.750
Yes, ma'am. I didn't mean
to cause any offence.

22:21.800 --> 22:26.790
Hana Reznikova works two jobs,
all hours, cleaner and waitress.

22:26.840 --> 22:29.710
Yes, ma'am. Still, my gaffer's asked
me to rule out any connection.

22:29.760 --> 22:31.510
He said he'd sent you an e-mail.

22:31.560 --> 22:33.870
It's all been a bit hectic here.

22:33.920 --> 22:37.790
Rikki Neville, 21-year-old,
last seen just before Christmas.

22:37.840 --> 22:39.870
What do you need from us?

22:39.920 --> 22:41.190
Thank you, ma'am.

22:41.240 --> 22:43.790
We've arranged a post-charge
interview with Michael Farmer,

22:43.840 --> 22:47.030
just to put some questions about my case.

22:47.080 --> 22:48.440
Fine.

22:50.520 --> 22:54.110
I'll just wait here until one
of your team's available, ma'am.

22:54.160 --> 22:56.910
You know what, interviewing Farmer...

22:56.960 --> 22:59.390
perhaps it would help if I was there?

22:59.440 --> 23:01.080
Yeah. Very good, ma'am.

23:40.560 --> 23:42.430
Right.

23:42.480 --> 23:43.990
Um...

23:44.040 --> 23:47.070
Michael, my name's Kate Flynn,
I'm a Detective Sergeant on the

23:47.120 --> 23:49.030
East Midlands Constabulary.

23:49.080 --> 23:51.630
You remember DCI Huntley from
Polk Avenue Police Station?

23:51.680 --> 23:53.550
Hello, Michael.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.750
Thank you for speaking to us today.

23:55.800 --> 23:58.030
How are you, Michael?

23:58.080 --> 23:59.120
Been in a fight?

24:00.320 --> 24:02.590
I had one of my falls.

24:02.640 --> 24:05.350
It can be tough in prison if
you're in for certain kinds

24:05.400 --> 24:07.550
of offences, even if
you're only on remand.

24:07.600 --> 24:09.630
We can speak to the
Offender Management Officer,

24:09.680 --> 24:11.110
explain that you're helping us.

24:11.160 --> 24:13.910
And maybe that way they can
do more to protect you.

24:13.960 --> 24:15.190
Thank you.

24:15.240 --> 24:18.880
Right, now first I need to remind
you that you remain under caution.

24:22.200 --> 24:25.550
What that means is you shouldn't
say anything unless you're OK

24:25.600 --> 24:27.950
for it to be used against you in court.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.470
You can avoid a question
by saying no comment

24:30.520 --> 24:33.120
and you can stop the
interview at any time.

24:35.120 --> 24:37.470
I need to ask you about your
whereabouts in the two weeks

24:37.520 --> 24:38.910
after New Year.

24:38.960 --> 24:42.070
Did you travel to the Leicester
area in early January?

24:42.120 --> 24:43.160
Um...

24:46.320 --> 24:48.030
Don't remember.

24:48.080 --> 24:50.280
You don't remember ever leaving town?

24:51.320 --> 24:52.750
I don't get out much.

24:52.800 --> 24:57.310
You didn't take a bus or a
train out of town at all?

24:57.360 --> 25:00.030
It was a while ago. I'm sorry.

25:00.080 --> 25:02.030
I might've forgotten.

25:02.080 --> 25:04.150
What about driving?

25:04.200 --> 25:07.080
- Uh... - Do you ever drive
out of town at all, Michael?

25:08.560 --> 25:09.920
Michael?

25:11.760 --> 25:12.800
No.

25:15.520 --> 25:17.070
Here's a photo.

25:17.120 --> 25:19.190
This is the girl I'm asking you about.

25:19.240 --> 25:22.030
She looks a bit like Hana
Reznikova, doesn't she?

25:22.080 --> 25:24.320
Similar age, same sort of hair, I mean.

25:25.920 --> 25:27.030
I...

25:27.080 --> 25:28.590
Michael...

25:28.640 --> 25:31.030
did you steal anything from her?

25:31.080 --> 25:32.630
I, um...

25:32.680 --> 25:35.710
DCI Huntley's explained to me
that Hana Reznikova was wearing

25:35.760 --> 25:38.390
a set of earrings that
were found in your house.

25:38.440 --> 25:40.750
And this girl, someone reckons
they saw her getting into

25:40.800 --> 25:41.870
a car with a stranger,

25:41.920 --> 25:45.630
which is what's alleged to have
happened with Hana Reznikova.

25:45.680 --> 25:47.550
I don't want to get in more trouble.

25:47.600 --> 25:49.590
Michael, you can answer however you like.

25:49.640 --> 25:52.670
If you want to change your
story, you can, but it's important

25:52.720 --> 25:57.350
that you know that changing answers
may harm your defence in court.

25:57.400 --> 25:58.920
That's correct, Michael.

26:02.960 --> 26:05.830
The reason I'm asking you about
the car, Michael, is because this

26:05.880 --> 26:09.120
is what's alleged to have
happened with Hana Reznikova.

26:11.400 --> 26:13.550
I don't want to get things wrong.

26:13.600 --> 26:15.110
I get...

26:15.160 --> 26:16.660
I get muddled sometimes.

26:19.160 --> 26:21.440
What do you get muddled about, Michael?

26:27.800 --> 26:30.280
Do you want to stop the
interview, Michael?

26:32.320 --> 26:33.510
Yes, please.

26:33.560 --> 26:35.200
OK. We'll leave it there.

26:38.800 --> 26:42.440
- Is that all right, DS Flynn?
- Yeah, of course, ma'am, no problem.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.120
Thanks, everyone.

26:57.560 --> 26:58.800
Did I do all right?

27:00.440 --> 27:01.480
In what way?

27:02.560 --> 27:04.360
You said if I did well, you'd...

27:05.920 --> 27:08.320
.. you'd tell them to
look after me better.

27:09.680 --> 27:10.720
Yeah, I will.

27:23.040 --> 27:24.270
Sorry about that, ma'am.

27:24.320 --> 27:26.470
I hope I haven't wasted your time.

27:26.520 --> 27:28.030
No, not at all.

27:28.080 --> 27:29.790
Do you mind if I ask
you some questions now?

27:29.840 --> 27:31.630
It would be good to beat the traffic home.

27:31.680 --> 27:33.230
Look, I don't mean to be presumptuous,

27:33.280 --> 27:35.270
but you're barking up the wrong tree.

27:35.320 --> 27:37.230
Why would you say that, ma'am?

27:37.280 --> 27:39.670
Farmer took trophies
from each of his victims.

27:39.720 --> 27:42.270
We did a thorough search of the
house, the fire's investigator

27:42.320 --> 27:45.150
found no evidence of similar
items incinerated in the fire.

27:45.200 --> 27:47.790
Three trophies, three victims.

27:47.840 --> 27:50.910
Whatever happened to your missing
girl, she was not the fourth.

27:50.960 --> 27:53.110
I'm sorry if you've had a wasted journey.

27:53.160 --> 27:54.430
No, not at all, ma'am.

27:54.480 --> 27:56.550
I really appreciate the
time you've given me.

27:56.600 --> 27:58.390
You're welcome.

27:58.440 --> 27:59.600
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

28:21.720 --> 28:22.920
All right?

28:25.080 --> 28:26.230
I interviewed Farmer.

28:26.280 --> 28:29.070
One uncontrolled crime of
passion, that I can imagine.

28:29.120 --> 28:31.510
But two or three, leaving
no clues for months?

28:31.560 --> 28:33.910
According to his medical
records, he was diagnosed with

28:33.960 --> 28:35.950
learning difficulties when he was 11.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.030
That doesn't necessarily
mean he was incapable

28:38.080 --> 28:39.590
of committing the offences.

28:39.640 --> 28:41.670
True, but he was meant to
have stolen the car used

28:41.720 --> 28:44.710
to abduct Hana Reznikova. I'm
not even convinced he can drive.

28:44.760 --> 28:46.190
His solicitor bring that up?

28:46.240 --> 28:48.070
Don't even get me started
on the solicitor.

28:48.120 --> 28:49.670
You pressed Huntley on the driving?

28:49.720 --> 28:51.910
I know how to run an undercover.

28:51.960 --> 28:53.230
Never said you didn't.

28:53.280 --> 28:54.590
Well, we could leave it to you,

28:54.640 --> 28:57.790
but I don't want us to
all end up in court again.

28:57.840 --> 28:59.920
Don't worry, mate. We'll get there.

29:01.320 --> 29:02.480
- Right.
- Night, mate.

29:14.080 --> 29:16.990
- Yep? - Tim Ifield's raised legitimate
questions, don't get me wrong, sir.

29:17.040 --> 29:19.590
I've looked at the electronic
submissions to the CPS.

29:19.640 --> 29:22.870
The MG3, MG5 and all the
MG11s are by the book.

29:22.920 --> 29:25.710
The MG6 initial disclosure is
what I'd expect at this stage.

29:25.760 --> 29:28.430
But signal strength triangulation
places Michael's mobile phone

29:28.480 --> 29:31.190
in the vicinity of his grandmother's
nursing home and not the

29:31.240 --> 29:32.750
abduction of Hana Reznikova.

29:32.800 --> 29:34.910
Right. Well, we all know how this works.

29:34.960 --> 29:36.310
There's a chain of evidence,

29:36.360 --> 29:38.390
it starts with the investigating
team, goes on to the

29:38.440 --> 29:41.510
Senior Investigating Officer, who
presents it to the Crown Prosecutor.

29:41.560 --> 29:44.710
The Prosecutor can only consider
the evidence put in front of her.

29:44.760 --> 29:47.030
What we don't know is how Huntley
presented it all when she

29:47.080 --> 29:49.230
- made the case for charging Farmer.
- Exactly.

29:49.280 --> 29:51.790
Nothing in Huntley's record
suggests she's ever done anything

29:51.840 --> 29:52.990
like this before.

29:53.040 --> 29:54.750
And she can't have a
grudge against Farmer,

29:54.800 --> 29:55.990
she's got no connection to him.

29:56.040 --> 29:57.590
Maybe on the balance of evidence,

29:57.640 --> 29:59.270
she believes Michael Farmer's guilty.

29:59.320 --> 30:01.390
She's just an honest copper
getting on with the job.

30:01.440 --> 30:04.030
Yep, the job she's been given.

30:04.080 --> 30:05.270
Sir?

30:05.320 --> 30:08.110
Well, Huntley's superiors, they
won't have been kept in the dark

30:08.160 --> 30:09.670
about such a high profile case.

30:09.720 --> 30:11.710
I mean, one girl dead, one presumed.

30:11.760 --> 30:13.550
One by the grace of God.

30:13.600 --> 30:15.510
No progress for months.

30:15.560 --> 30:17.910
Senior officers only get told
what they want to hear, sir.

30:17.960 --> 30:20.190
Yeah, well, I must be the exception.

30:20.240 --> 30:22.990
Sir, I managed to check
the electronic door entry

30:23.040 --> 30:26.190
download to Polk Avenue the night
of Michael Farmer's questioning.

30:26.240 --> 30:28.870
And it shows access via the
warrant card registered to

30:28.920 --> 30:31.020
Assistant Chief Constable Hilton.

30:33.440 --> 30:35.430
Right.

30:35.480 --> 30:37.470
OK. Thanks, you two.

30:37.520 --> 30:38.560
Sir.

30:41.600 --> 30:42.880
I'll be right out.

30:47.320 --> 30:49.350
I don't know if this is a
good time, sir, but I've been

30:49.400 --> 30:52.390
a DS for over five years now
and I hope I've proved myself.

30:52.440 --> 30:54.670
I've recently passed the
National Inspectors' Exam.

30:54.720 --> 30:56.390
Yes, I was aware.

30:56.440 --> 30:59.510
Well, I feel I'm right for a
promotion, sir, if you'll back me?

30:59.560 --> 31:02.070
Full marks for ambition, son.

31:02.120 --> 31:04.880
Rest assured, I will give
it due consideration.

31:06.960 --> 31:08.320
Sir.

31:20.800 --> 31:22.000
The sea bass for me.

31:24.600 --> 31:27.840
And I'll have the sirloin
steak, medium-rare, no sauce.

31:29.560 --> 31:31.470
You didn't fancy some vino, did you, Ted?

31:31.520 --> 31:33.710
Oh, no, no, no. A bit
too early for me, sir.

31:33.760 --> 31:35.830
Although you might consider
that recent successes

31:35.880 --> 31:37.480
merit a glass of bubbly?

31:38.720 --> 31:42.070
It's a bit early for me too, but
certainly a cloud's been lifted.

31:42.120 --> 31:45.110
Yes, well, I mean, expectations are
so high from the public these days.

31:45.160 --> 31:47.390
I mean, they think that
forensic science is going to

31:47.440 --> 31:49.750
lead us directly to the door
of the offender, you know.

31:49.800 --> 31:51.550
Public trust has been restored,

31:51.600 --> 31:55.640
the Chief Constable and the PCC have
dialled down their rabid anxiety.

31:56.800 --> 31:59.280
So, we can relax and
enjoy a pleasant lunch.

32:01.960 --> 32:05.230
But, I mean, it is a very
trying situation, you know,

32:05.280 --> 32:09.070
and that level of anxiety starts
to filter down through the ranks.

32:09.120 --> 32:10.910
How so?

32:10.960 --> 32:12.830
Well, you said yourself,
sir, public trust,

32:12.880 --> 32:15.150
expectation of getting a
result can sometimes lead to

32:15.200 --> 32:18.150
undue pressure on a
detective to close a case.

32:18.200 --> 32:20.390
Well, I don't think that's
always such a bad thing.

32:20.440 --> 32:22.560
Sometimes you've got to light a fire.

32:23.720 --> 32:24.760
Indeed, sir.

32:25.760 --> 32:27.070
Indeed.

32:27.120 --> 32:30.910
However, a detective under that kind
of undue pressure can sometimes bend

32:30.960 --> 32:35.160
the facts to suit the expectations
of his, or her, superiors.

32:36.480 --> 32:38.590
I've got better antennae than that.

32:38.640 --> 32:41.030
You know we can't be micromanagers, Ted.

32:41.080 --> 32:42.690
We trust our officers...

32:42.740 --> 32:46.190
.. to conduct themselves with
professionalism and integrity.

32:46.240 --> 32:48.470
Sorry.

32:48.520 --> 32:49.600
ACC Hilton.

33:02.520 --> 33:03.640
Steve.

33:08.240 --> 33:10.750
How do you know when an
executive officer's telling lies?

33:10.800 --> 33:12.150
His lips move.

33:12.200 --> 33:15.230
There may be something in
this. I sincerely hope not,

33:15.280 --> 33:18.390
but I'm relying on you and Kate
to get to the bottom of it.

33:18.440 --> 33:21.510
As of now, we are investigating
Roz Huntley's charging

33:21.560 --> 33:23.590
of Michael Farmer.

33:23.640 --> 33:24.760
- Sir.
- Good.

33:53.320 --> 33:54.790
Jade Hopkirk?

33:54.840 --> 33:57.630
- What's he done now?
- No-one's in any trouble, miss.

33:57.680 --> 33:59.990
Would it be possible to
talk to you inside, please?

34:00.040 --> 34:01.400
Free country.

34:14.080 --> 34:16.750
I appreciate this may be a
difficult subject for you, Jade,

34:16.800 --> 34:19.719
but I'm here to talk to
you about Michael Farmer.

34:20.840 --> 34:22.190
All right.

34:22.239 --> 34:25.710
Do you mind if I ask, how
did you know Mr Farmer?

34:25.760 --> 34:28.070
Just from the estate.

34:28.120 --> 34:29.630
I don't mean to push.

34:29.679 --> 34:32.270
Could you tell me a bit more, please?

34:32.320 --> 34:35.030
We used to walk the same
way home from school.

34:35.080 --> 34:37.469
That's how it started, I suppose.

34:37.520 --> 34:40.630
According to records I've
accessed in relation to my inquiry,

34:40.679 --> 34:44.429
a complaint about Michael Farmer
was made on 18th June 2009

34:44.480 --> 34:47.440
by your mother, alleging
Michael Farmer raped you.

34:48.760 --> 34:50.830
Why you asking me all this now?

34:50.880 --> 34:52.710
This relates to a new inquiry.

34:52.760 --> 34:55.150
I'm not at liberty to say more.

34:55.199 --> 34:59.190
I am sorry for bringing up a
traumatic experience, Jade.

34:59.240 --> 35:00.560
Thank you.

35:01.880 --> 35:03.790
At the time, you were 15 years old?

35:03.840 --> 35:07.030
- Yeah.
- And Mr Farmer, he was 16?

35:07.080 --> 35:08.390
Yeah.

35:08.440 --> 35:10.750
And this offence took place
in Michael Farmer's home?

35:10.800 --> 35:14.440
His grandma was out. We were
alone, listening to music and that.

35:16.200 --> 35:19.350
Was there a friendship of some
sort before the attack took place?

35:19.400 --> 35:21.990
I thought he just wanted to be friends.

35:22.040 --> 35:24.350
But you made clear to Michael
Farmer you didn't want to have

35:24.400 --> 35:25.720
intercourse with him?

35:27.080 --> 35:28.350
Yeah.

35:31.080 --> 35:34.230
In his initial statement,
Michael claims you went along?

35:34.280 --> 35:37.280
Yeah, and then he said he'd
done it, so what's the problem?

35:54.600 --> 35:57.230
- Morning, boss.
- Hey, Neil, how's it going?

35:57.280 --> 35:59.430
Sorry, boss, the DS from East Mids.

35:59.480 --> 36:01.830
How long do you want to give her?

36:01.880 --> 36:03.230
You've lost me.

36:03.280 --> 36:07.240
To go through the interviews with
Farmer and the witness statements.

36:15.960 --> 36:19.110
Do you mind telling me
what's going on here?

36:19.160 --> 36:21.310
My gaffer wasn't happy with
what I got out of Farmer.

36:21.360 --> 36:23.030
He said there was holes in his statement.

36:23.080 --> 36:25.790
He wants more before we can rule him out.

36:25.840 --> 36:28.710
Sorry, ma'am, I... Your
team seemed fine with it.

36:28.760 --> 36:30.510
I didn't want to disturb you at home.

36:30.560 --> 36:31.870
I'm the SIO.

36:31.920 --> 36:33.710
You ask me.

36:33.760 --> 36:35.990
Yes, ma'am, I'm sorry.
I meant no disrespect.

36:36.040 --> 36:37.390
I'd like you to desist, please,

36:37.440 --> 36:39.990
while I take this up
with your senior officer.

36:40.040 --> 36:41.760
Yeah. As you wish, ma'am.

36:43.160 --> 36:45.310
I'll get someone to do that.

36:45.360 --> 36:46.560
Very good, ma'am.

36:54.800 --> 36:56.750
As you know, ma'am, I'm
only here to solve a crime.

36:56.800 --> 36:58.230
We're both on the same side.

36:58.280 --> 36:59.670
Of course.

36:59.720 --> 37:01.230
I'm very sorry, ma'am.

37:01.280 --> 37:02.640
OK.

37:14.960 --> 37:17.110
- Hello, switch.
- DCI Huntley.

37:17.160 --> 37:18.990
Can you put me through
to Missing Persons at the

37:19.040 --> 37:20.760
East Midlands Constabulary?

37:31.000 --> 37:33.070
DS Flynn's interfering
with my investigation.

37:33.120 --> 37:35.710
I'd rather she was denied
further access to our files.

37:35.760 --> 37:37.390
I'm sorry to hear that, DCI Huntley,

37:37.440 --> 37:40.110
but I need to speak to
my Chief Superintendent.

37:40.160 --> 37:44.070
DS Flynn's secondment is an
important line of inquiry for us.

37:44.120 --> 37:46.790
I appreciate that, but I'm finding
her a disruptive influence.

37:46.840 --> 37:49.950
Huntley's call was intercepted by
our undercover ops handling service.

37:50.000 --> 37:52.350
They're on standby to go over
Huntley's head and push Kate

37:52.400 --> 37:54.630
- back on her. - Yes, well,
she certainly sounds rattled.

37:54.680 --> 37:57.030
Huntley's definitely hiding
something about how the case

37:57.080 --> 37:59.950
against Farmer was handled.
What, I don't know.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.630
Steve, you're going to look into
the original conviction that got

38:02.680 --> 38:05.110
Farmer put on the Sex
Offenders Register, right?

38:05.160 --> 38:07.750
Erm, yeah. It checks out.

38:07.800 --> 38:11.430
Which suggests that maybe Huntley's
got the right man after all.

38:11.480 --> 38:13.910
Makes me think twice about
moving Kate's undercover

38:13.960 --> 38:15.630
up to the next level.

38:15.680 --> 38:16.950
Er, no, no.

38:17.000 --> 38:20.240
I agree with Kate, sir. It's
still worth digging deeper.

38:22.720 --> 38:24.270
Right, well, you're my best team.

38:24.320 --> 38:26.070
If that's what you both think.

38:26.120 --> 38:28.240
- Let's turn the screw.
- Sir.

38:38.720 --> 38:40.240
Someone to see you, ma'am.

38:42.480 --> 38:44.030
DS Arnott, ma'am.

38:44.080 --> 38:45.440
AC-12.

38:48.120 --> 38:49.510
Who are you here to see?

38:49.560 --> 38:52.270
I'm making enquiries
into Operation Trapdoor.

38:52.320 --> 38:53.830
In regards to what?

38:53.880 --> 38:57.040
Just opening our inquiry,
ma'am. It's too early to say.

38:58.360 --> 39:00.110
Then why are you here in person?

39:00.160 --> 39:01.710
A courtesy call.

39:01.760 --> 39:03.910
Just passing.

39:03.960 --> 39:05.760
I'll see you again, DCI Huntley.

39:21.320 --> 39:22.630
May I ask what you're doing here?

39:22.680 --> 39:25.150
We haven't been able to rule
out Michael Farmer's involvement

39:25.200 --> 39:28.230
in a number of unsolved crimes
within the jurisdiction of the

39:28.280 --> 39:33.190
East Midlands Constabulary, so we're
creating a bilateral task force.

39:33.240 --> 39:36.560
I've been placed on temporary
secondment to your team, ma'am.

39:44.640 --> 39:47.110
You push from the inside,
I'll push from the outside.

39:47.160 --> 39:48.280
She'll crack.

40:14.000 --> 40:15.430
Thank you for seeing me, sir.

40:15.480 --> 40:17.870
My pleasure. Thanks, Jan.

40:17.920 --> 40:18.960
How can I help?

40:21.920 --> 40:24.790
I wonder if you have any
idea why AC-12 are examining

40:24.840 --> 40:26.080
Operation Trapdoor?

40:27.400 --> 40:28.950
Um...

40:29.000 --> 40:30.560
I'm not corrupt, sir.

40:31.880 --> 40:33.510
Nor are my team.

40:33.560 --> 40:35.950
All procedures were followed.

40:36.000 --> 40:39.710
Evidence met the threshold
test, met and surpassed it.

40:39.760 --> 40:43.390
I stuck with you on this because
you're better than your record.

40:43.440 --> 40:44.990
Your career break, I mean.

40:45.040 --> 40:47.110
All those years out being a full-time mum.

40:47.160 --> 40:50.070
Some would worry that
had cost you your edge.

40:50.120 --> 40:55.350
But I have the advantage of knowing
first-hand how good you are.

40:55.400 --> 40:56.750
Thank you very much, sir.

40:56.800 --> 41:01.270
There's a lot of evidence,
pro and con, a lot of facts.

41:01.320 --> 41:04.400
You've got what it takes
to cut through all that.

41:05.400 --> 41:07.230
There's facts...

41:07.280 --> 41:09.160
and then there's the truth.

41:10.640 --> 41:12.670
I know you won't let me down.

41:12.720 --> 41:14.080
Yes, sir.

41:35.360 --> 41:38.950
Hi, Jane. Can I take a look at
the forensic reports on these

41:39.000 --> 41:40.750
particular items of evidence?

41:40.800 --> 41:42.350
I've lost track of the e-mails.

41:42.400 --> 41:45.150
All the reference numbers are down there.

41:45.200 --> 41:46.840
No problem, coming right up.

41:55.480 --> 41:58.550
- Everything all right, Tim? - Hi,
Roz. - Why don't you guys go in?

41:58.600 --> 41:59.880
Yeah, yeah, all good.

42:07.120 --> 42:08.550
Right, then. Have a good day.

42:08.600 --> 42:10.120
You too.

42:17.840 --> 42:19.990
- Morning.
- Morning.

42:20.040 --> 42:22.870
Your friend's been here a
couple of hours already.

42:22.920 --> 42:25.360
- Friend?
- I put him in the meeting room.

42:40.200 --> 42:41.350
Tim.

42:41.400 --> 42:43.710
PC Bindra said I could
wait till you arrived.

42:43.760 --> 42:45.030
Or you can make an appointment.

42:45.080 --> 42:47.830
I'd rather people didn't
know I was coming here.

42:47.880 --> 42:49.550
So what have you discovered so far?

42:49.600 --> 42:52.110
Well, the inquiry's ongoing so
it would be inappropriate to...

42:52.160 --> 42:53.750
So you're investigating. Great.

42:53.800 --> 42:55.230
Well, this'll help.

42:55.280 --> 42:58.310
Now, I was only responsible
for coordinating the

42:58.360 --> 43:00.910
forensic deployment in
Michael Farmer's house.

43:00.960 --> 43:04.990
But I've been able to access
reports into the evidence obtained

43:05.040 --> 43:08.950
from Hana Reznikova, the alleged
victim, and Michael Farmer himself.

43:09.000 --> 43:11.910
If Michael Farmer had bundled
Hana Reznikova into his car and

43:11.960 --> 43:15.150
dragged her into his house,
you'd imagine that some of his

43:15.200 --> 43:17.550
clothes' fibres would have
been detected on her clothing,

43:17.600 --> 43:18.640
wouldn't you?

43:19.720 --> 43:20.830
Yeah, of course.

43:20.880 --> 43:23.910
The clothing worn by Hana
Reznikova shows no fibres

43:23.960 --> 43:27.030
detected that match the
clothing worn by Michael Farmer,

43:27.080 --> 43:30.150
only black fibres from a
cotton and polyester blend,

43:30.200 --> 43:32.630
that could have come from a
black jacket like her abductor

43:32.680 --> 43:34.030
was wearing.

43:34.080 --> 43:36.630
Farmer was wearing different
clothing when he was arrested.

43:36.680 --> 43:38.870
He could have disposed
of the black jacket.

43:38.920 --> 43:41.390
No black fibres were found
on Michael Farmer's clothing

43:41.440 --> 43:42.870
or in his house.

43:42.920 --> 43:46.080
No fibres from a balaclava
were found in his hair.

43:47.720 --> 43:51.760
Now, Roz Huntley is too clever
for all this to have been missed.

43:53.080 --> 43:54.790
I feel like I'm alone.

43:54.840 --> 43:58.710
Like no-one else at Polk Avenue
realises what's really going on.

43:58.760 --> 44:01.590
I mean, of all people, you
know what that feels like.

44:01.640 --> 44:04.110
- Sorry?
- You were a whistle-blower.

44:04.160 --> 44:06.510
You know, you refused to go
along with the cover-up into the

44:06.560 --> 44:08.670
shooting of Karim Ali and
you testified against your

44:08.720 --> 44:09.910
colleagues at the inquest.

44:09.960 --> 44:12.790
That is why I insisted
on meeting only you.

44:12.840 --> 44:14.350
Because you'd understand.

44:14.400 --> 44:17.150
You understand what I'm thinking.

44:17.200 --> 44:20.710
Now, either the forensic
investigators were silenced

44:20.760 --> 44:22.360
by Roz Huntley...

44:23.360 --> 44:25.910
.. or they're in on the conspiracy too.

44:25.960 --> 44:27.470
"Conspiracy"?

44:27.520 --> 44:28.870
To do what?

44:28.920 --> 44:31.270
To ignore evidence pointing
at another suspect.

44:31.320 --> 44:34.190
I mean, you've seen the balaclava photo?

44:34.240 --> 44:35.350
Of course.

44:35.400 --> 44:37.950
It's been released to the press,
so it's in the public domain.

44:38.000 --> 44:41.110
Right, well, this is the CCTV image
of a suspicious figure wearing

44:41.160 --> 44:43.670
a balaclava and black jacket
seen in the vicinity of the

44:43.720 --> 44:45.670
disappearance of the second victim.

44:45.720 --> 44:47.910
Leonie Collersdale. Last
seen 25th of January.

44:47.960 --> 44:50.950
Now, I've got some software
that can analyse his biometrics.

44:51.000 --> 44:52.310
This has all been tried.

44:52.360 --> 44:54.510
Because of the high angle,
the figure's height can't be

44:54.560 --> 44:56.470
estimated without a wide margin of error.

44:56.520 --> 45:00.070
Correct. Now, vertical
measurements are highly unreliable.

45:00.120 --> 45:01.990
Horizontal ones aren't.

45:02.040 --> 45:04.670
Such as foot size.

45:04.720 --> 45:09.840
This is 27.5cm, the
equivalent to a UK size ten.

45:11.200 --> 45:13.870
Now, the footwear seized from
Michael Farmer's home and belonging

45:13.920 --> 45:15.620
to him was all a UK size eight.

45:17.320 --> 45:20.030
You believe this can't be Michael Farmer?

45:20.080 --> 45:21.110
Not only that.

45:21.160 --> 45:23.630
The boot print captured
from the kitchen floor

45:23.680 --> 45:27.720
of Michael Farmer's home
was also a UK size ten.

45:35.960 --> 45:40.150
This is the man I'm convinced killed
Baswinder Kaur, Leonie Collersdale,

45:40.200 --> 45:41.630
and abducted Hana Reznikova,

45:41.680 --> 45:43.630
and framed Michael Farmer for everything,

45:43.680 --> 45:46.760
and Roz Huntley has stopped
everyone looking for him.

45:58.080 --> 45:59.120
Jodie?

46:05.640 --> 46:07.080
Anything I can do, ma'am?

46:08.360 --> 46:12.230
Yes. Some of the forensics
in the Michael Farmer case,

46:12.280 --> 46:13.880
I'd like them reprocessed.

46:15.440 --> 46:17.070
Sure.

46:17.120 --> 46:19.920
- I'll e-mail a list of which ones.
- OK, no problem.

47:04.200 --> 47:05.990
Hello.

47:06.040 --> 47:08.630
Would you like to order
from the breakfast menu?

47:08.680 --> 47:10.670
Uh, right, um...

47:10.720 --> 47:12.870
No, I'll just have a cup of tea, please.

47:12.920 --> 47:15.590
OK, we have Earl Grey, English
breakfast, peppermint tea?

47:15.640 --> 47:16.880
Yeah, Earl Grey.

47:18.200 --> 47:21.400
- Earl Grey. OK, take a seat,
sir, I'll bring it over. - Thanks.

47:59.440 --> 48:01.640
That's me, sir, if you're interested.

48:03.440 --> 48:06.790
Yeah, maybe we should fix a
time for you to come round

48:06.840 --> 48:07.960
and size up my flat?

48:09.200 --> 48:11.320
Great! I'll check my diary.

48:12.320 --> 48:14.350
Just don't leave before
we make an appointment.

48:14.400 --> 48:15.720
I won't.

48:52.040 --> 48:54.790
Sorry, ma'am, but I thought
you should know about this.

48:54.840 --> 48:57.390
When I looked at the forensic
reports on Michael Farmer's

48:57.440 --> 48:59.550
- and Hana Reznikova's
clothing... - Yes?

48:59.600 --> 49:03.670
Last one to tell tales, but Tim
Ifield signed out the reports.

49:03.720 --> 49:05.560
He's been looking at them too.

49:08.000 --> 49:09.160
Thanks, Jodie.

49:15.480 --> 49:17.360
Are you OK, ma'am? Fancy a cuppa?

49:18.600 --> 49:20.400
- No, thank you.
- OK.

49:26.400 --> 49:28.270
Having come under fierce criticism

49:28.320 --> 49:29.910
for failing to capture the murderer,

49:29.960 --> 49:33.110
Central Police are now being
praised for their breakthrough.

49:33.160 --> 49:35.560
Police and Crime Commissioner Paula...

50:02.160 --> 50:03.470
You all right?

50:03.520 --> 50:04.920
I need to go back to work.

50:14.880 --> 50:16.200
What's wrong with Mum?

51:32.000 --> 51:33.470
Oh, Roz?

51:33.520 --> 51:36.070
I was ringing that bell for
ages. You need to get it fixed.

51:36.120 --> 51:39.160
It's... It's silent. It's all
controlled by my computer.

51:40.400 --> 51:41.640
For God's sake.

51:46.760 --> 51:48.190
Can I come in?

51:48.240 --> 51:49.710
Um, yeah, yeah, of course.

51:49.760 --> 51:52.360
Is everything OK?

51:53.720 --> 51:55.510
No.

51:55.560 --> 51:58.550
That's what I want to talk about.

51:58.600 --> 52:00.910
OK. Can I get you a tea or a coffee?

52:00.960 --> 52:02.350
I'm not staying.

52:02.400 --> 52:04.070
I'm just going to ask you, straight up --

52:04.120 --> 52:05.560
what the hell is going on?

52:07.520 --> 52:08.710
I'm not sure what you mean.

52:08.760 --> 52:10.710
I'm the Senior Investigating Officer.

52:10.760 --> 52:12.390
You're the forensic coordinator.

52:12.440 --> 52:16.030
You have your area of expertise,
but fundamentally you answer to me.

52:16.080 --> 52:17.110
Yes.

52:17.160 --> 52:20.430
So why are you questioning my
evaluation of forensic evidence?

52:20.480 --> 52:22.030
Look, I can see you're upset,

52:22.080 --> 52:24.230
but wouldn't it be better if
we discussed this at work?

52:24.280 --> 52:25.750
I want to discuss it now.

52:25.800 --> 52:29.590
You've come to my home, at
night, you're clearly emotional.

52:29.640 --> 52:31.590
Don't make out I'm in the wrong, Tim.

52:31.640 --> 52:33.720
You're the one going behind my back.

52:40.560 --> 52:43.110
See? You know exactly
what I'm referring to.

52:43.160 --> 52:44.440
I had no choice.

52:45.840 --> 52:48.350
You had the choice to talk to me.

52:48.400 --> 52:50.550
- I tried.
- Oh, don't give me that.

52:50.600 --> 52:53.030
You made some half-hearted
effort to discuss a couple of

52:53.080 --> 52:54.750
minor anomalies in the evidence recovered

52:54.800 --> 52:57.270
- from Michael Farmer's house.
- They're hardly minor.

52:57.320 --> 53:00.390
Cases of this complexity
create mountains of evidence.

53:00.440 --> 53:02.430
It takes the experience of a good SIO

53:02.480 --> 53:04.910
to cut through all that
and recognise the truth.

53:04.960 --> 53:07.510
The evidence is the truth!

53:07.560 --> 53:10.390
You think Michael Farmer's
innocent, I know that he is guilty.

53:10.440 --> 53:12.790
There's a pattern of institutional
blindness, led by you,

53:12.840 --> 53:15.270
into the possibility of another suspect.

53:15.320 --> 53:17.790
What other suspect? There
is no other suspect!

53:17.840 --> 53:18.950
Balaclava Man!

53:19.000 --> 53:21.350
He committed the previous
murders and he planted evidence

53:21.400 --> 53:22.510
in Michael Farmer's house.

53:22.560 --> 53:26.390
Michael Farmer is Balaclava Man,
and those items were trophies.

53:26.440 --> 53:29.310
Of course they would have appeared
different to other household items.

53:29.360 --> 53:30.910
And the boot print -- so what?

53:30.960 --> 53:34.150
It's a house on a busy estate,
who knows who coming and going.

53:34.200 --> 53:37.070
You are taking your narrow
view of your own specialism,

53:37.120 --> 53:40.470
writing off all other parts
of the case that I, as SIO,

53:40.520 --> 53:41.950
am in a better position to evaluate.

53:42.000 --> 53:45.470
Listen, I can see you're angry,
but I think you should leave.

53:45.520 --> 53:46.990
Who the hell do you think you are?

53:47.040 --> 53:49.310
- Don't you push me.
- I'm not the one pushing.

53:49.360 --> 53:51.350
Can't you see I'm right
about Michael Farmer?

53:51.400 --> 53:55.190
No, actually, what I see is someone
who can't admit that she's wrong!

53:55.240 --> 53:57.150
This is my life, my career,

53:57.200 --> 54:00.030
and I will not have some sad
little wanker mess that up!

54:00.080 --> 54:01.830
Is that how you see Michael Farmer?

54:01.880 --> 54:04.790
Some "sad little wanker" that
you can frame and lock him up?

54:04.840 --> 54:06.270
I did not frame him.

54:06.320 --> 54:08.950
You made sure an INNOCENT man is charged!

54:09.000 --> 54:10.830
What do you know about anything?

54:10.880 --> 54:13.030
And what gives you the right
to say that he's innocent?

54:13.080 --> 54:15.470
What have you got against
Michael Farmer, except him being

54:15.520 --> 54:17.990
retarded enough for you to frame?!

54:18.040 --> 54:19.320
Argh!

54:22.960 --> 54:24.550
You just assaulted a police officer.

54:24.600 --> 54:26.230
Oh, no, no, no.

54:26.280 --> 54:28.230
- You're staying.
- I'm leaving.

54:28.280 --> 54:30.600
No, no, let's talk about this. Just stay.
