01:07.500 --> 01:09.166
Sophia, listen, how about this one?

01:09.233 --> 01:13.967
"Elderly white male with broken hip
seeks elderly white female.

01:15.767 --> 01:19.967
I am into massages, bran muffins,
and the book final exit.

01:22.100 --> 01:25.633
Please respond quickly, or I'll do it.
I swear I will."

01:27.166 --> 01:28.500
Too much pressure. Moving on.

01:29.633 --> 01:31.233
Okay, here's another good one.

01:31.300 --> 01:33.767
"Recent widower seeks widow.

01:33.834 --> 01:37.166
I am handsome, intelligent,
and possess great style.

01:37.767 --> 01:40.667
I'm also incontinent,
but have learned to laugh about it."

01:42.066 --> 01:43.166
Well, that's a keeper.

01:44.266 --> 01:46.266
What is going on here?

01:46.333 --> 01:48.433
I'm looking through the Personals
for a man.

01:48.500 --> 01:50.233
Remember what that is?

01:50.300 --> 01:53.867
-Kind of like a woman except it's got--
-Ma!

01:56.000 --> 01:57.433
I know what a man is.

01:57.500 --> 02:00.400
But I tell you I would never look for one
through the Personals.

02:00.467 --> 02:01.500
You know why?

02:01.567 --> 02:03.433
Because I have standards.

02:03.500 --> 02:06.166
I have intelligence, I have class.

02:06.233 --> 02:07.600
And you know what else I have?

02:07.667 --> 02:09.667
It's not self-awareness,
that's for damn sure.

02:12.233 --> 02:13.834
Hey, listen to this.

02:14.633 --> 02:17.333
"Older gentleman seeks lady of refinement.

02:17.400 --> 02:21.200
I like moonlit nights,
romantic Italian dinners,

02:21.633 --> 02:23.233
and waking up in the morning.

02:25.333 --> 02:27.633
If you're old enough to remember
when Sinatra was skinny,

02:27.700 --> 02:29.100
please send letter and photo."

02:30.400 --> 02:31.300
This is the one.

02:31.367 --> 02:32.233
He's perfect.

02:32.300 --> 02:33.900
I found myself a man.

02:35.767 --> 02:38.967
I just got a call from Thor Anderson
in St. Olaf.

02:39.033 --> 02:40.633
He'll be in Miami next week.

02:40.700 --> 02:43.700
We're getting together
to talk about old times.

02:43.767 --> 02:44.700
So?

02:44.767 --> 02:47.734
I don't know a Thor Anderson in St. Olaf.

02:49.667 --> 02:51.133
But he certainly knew me.

02:51.767 --> 02:53.767
Boy, it's finally beginning to happen.

02:53.834 --> 02:56.300
I'm getting old and forgetting things,

02:56.367 --> 03:00.467
forgetting people
who, at one time, were important to me.

03:00.533 --> 03:03.100
Don't be ridiculous.
You're as mentally fit as you ever were.

03:03.166 --> 03:04.200
We all are.

03:04.266 --> 03:05.600
Oh, thank you...

03:08.934 --> 03:10.767
-Sophia.
-Sophia!

03:10.834 --> 03:11.900
You're welcome...

03:12.867 --> 03:14.166
-Rose.
-Rose.

03:15.967 --> 03:19.467
Any wonder we get nursing home brochures
by the truckload?

03:25.433 --> 03:27.166
The guy from the ad
will be here any second.

03:28.300 --> 03:29.000
How do I look?

03:33.400 --> 03:36.166
Ma, you forgot to zip up your dress.

03:36.233 --> 03:38.200
I didn't forget.
He's probably got arthritis.

03:38.266 --> 03:39.400
Why make it any harder?

03:42.166 --> 03:43.266
(doorbell rings)

03:43.333 --> 03:44.100
That's him.

03:44.166 --> 03:46.700
Sophia, remember, play hard to get.

03:46.767 --> 03:48.233
It drives a man crazy.

03:48.700 --> 03:50.367
Read that somewhere, did you?

03:56.533 --> 04:00.867
Play hard to get,
play hard to get, play hard to get.

04:02.600 --> 04:05.133
Take me here! Take me now!

04:06.667 --> 04:09.233
I'm sorry. I'm looking for Rose Nylund.

04:09.300 --> 04:12.133
I'm an old friend from... Rose!

04:12.200 --> 04:13.033
(laughs)

04:13.100 --> 04:14.900
It's me! Thor!

04:14.967 --> 04:16.033
Thor?

04:16.100 --> 04:17.600
Thor Anderson?

04:17.667 --> 04:19.066
I can't believe it.

04:19.734 --> 04:22.667
Everybody, this is Thor Anderson.

04:22.734 --> 04:24.133
Hi, everybody.

04:25.533 --> 04:27.934
Rose and I used to date
one another back home.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.133
(cackles)

04:29.200 --> 04:31.767
We had some wild times, didn't we, Rose?

04:31.834 --> 04:33.367
Ho ho ho! Did we ever.

04:35.767 --> 04:38.500
I'll go get things settled in my hotel,

04:38.567 --> 04:41.000
then I'll come pick you up for dinner.

04:41.066 --> 04:43.233
We got lots of catching up to do.

04:43.300 --> 04:45.200
Ho ho ho! Do we ever.

04:46.500 --> 04:47.400
Great!

04:47.834 --> 04:48.967
I'll be back soon.

04:53.567 --> 04:56.100
I haven't the slightest idea
who that man is.

04:57.834 --> 05:00.000
Rose, what's wrong with you?

05:00.066 --> 05:03.066
Why didn't you say
you don't know who he is?

05:03.133 --> 05:05.100
And hurt an old friend?

05:06.400 --> 05:08.767
Boy, Dorothy, no wonder nobody likes you.

05:11.100 --> 05:12.266
(doorbell rings)

05:19.200 --> 05:21.600
I'm sorry, but I already know Jesus.

05:24.266 --> 05:25.433
(doorbell rings)

05:29.000 --> 05:30.767
I'm afraid there's been a mistake.

05:30.834 --> 05:36.100
-We're here to see "Sophia Petrillo."
-Oh, won't you come in.

05:37.533 --> 05:39.233
Are you Marvin from the ad?

05:39.300 --> 05:40.467
Yes, he is.

05:40.533 --> 05:42.633
And are you Sophia?

05:42.700 --> 05:45.200
Well, he doesn't look like he'll kill me.

05:47.233 --> 05:48.367
Yeah, I'm Sophia.

05:48.433 --> 05:51.767
Now, only one question remains,
who the hell are you?

05:53.533 --> 05:55.800
I'm Sarah, Marvin's sister.

05:56.367 --> 05:58.734
Marvin, don't you have something
for Sophia?

05:59.133 --> 05:59.800
Here.

06:01.300 --> 06:02.500
Hey, it talks.

06:04.700 --> 06:06.834
Marvin's just a little shy.

06:06.900 --> 06:10.200
He'll warm up and be more talkative
when we go to dinner.

06:10.266 --> 06:11.767
What do you mean, we?

06:12.667 --> 06:15.300
Marvin's eyes aren't what they used to be.

06:15.367 --> 06:18.800
He's not allowed to drive,
so he asked me to.

06:18.867 --> 06:20.567
I hope you don't mind.

06:20.633 --> 06:23.867
Marvin wants so much
to make a good impression.

06:24.934 --> 06:25.667
What do you say?

06:30.066 --> 06:31.967
No visible means of life support.

06:33.066 --> 06:34.333
I like that in a man.

06:35.467 --> 06:36.200
Let's roll.

06:39.567 --> 06:40.266
(door closes)

06:40.333 --> 06:43.800
You know, I always hoped
my mother would meet a nice couple.

06:54.500 --> 06:57.033
Blanche, you simply have to help me.

06:57.600 --> 07:02.367
I've been out with Thor twice now,
and I still can't remember who he is.

07:02.433 --> 07:04.467
He's coming here for dinner tonight.

07:04.533 --> 07:06.300
Blanche, please eat with us.

07:06.367 --> 07:08.233
You can ask questions. I can't.

07:08.300 --> 07:10.166
Oh, all right, fine,

07:10.233 --> 07:13.133
but I still don't understand
why you cannot remember this man.

07:13.200 --> 07:15.400
He says you seriously dated.

07:15.467 --> 07:18.567
How many boyfriends
could a naive farmer's daughter

07:18.633 --> 07:20.066
possibly have had?

07:21.233 --> 07:22.533
Two, three?

07:23.133 --> 07:25.934
Well, it depends.
What's your definition of a boyfriend?

07:26.000 --> 07:30.066
Any man you bring to a fevered pitch
of uncontrollable ecstasy.

07:34.066 --> 07:34.867
Oh.

07:36.400 --> 07:37.400
56.

07:41.867 --> 07:43.033
Excuse me?

07:43.934 --> 07:46.133
I had about 56 boyfriends.

07:46.200 --> 07:48.166
That was before I knew Charlie.

07:48.233 --> 07:49.734
I probably would've had more,

07:49.800 --> 07:52.400
but I wasn't allowed to date
till I was a senior.

07:53.834 --> 07:55.200
56?

07:55.266 --> 07:56.433
56?

07:56.500 --> 07:58.133
Stand back! She's gonna blow!

07:58.200 --> 08:00.700
What do you mean you had 56 boyfriends?

08:00.767 --> 08:03.033
You were a virgin till you got married.

08:03.100 --> 08:06.166
You can have a boyfriend
without going all the way.

08:06.233 --> 08:07.567
You cannot.

08:10.367 --> 08:14.166
If that were true,
that would mean you were a slut.

08:14.233 --> 08:15.967
Oh, come on, Blanche.

08:16.033 --> 08:17.600
How can you say that?

08:17.667 --> 08:20.767
So, she had 56 boyfriends in one year.

08:20.834 --> 08:22.600
-She's not a slut.
-Thank you, Dorothy.

08:22.667 --> 08:24.133
She is the slut.

08:28.667 --> 08:31.734
She's the grand pooh-bah of slutdom.

08:32.867 --> 08:35.500
She is the easiest woman in this room.

08:37.133 --> 08:39.033
Dorothy Zbornak, you take that back.

08:40.433 --> 08:42.967
The slut is dead. Long live the slut.

08:49.066 --> 08:49.834
Okay, listen up.

08:49.900 --> 08:50.867
I've got man trouble,

08:50.934 --> 08:52.800
and I need advice
from someone with experience.

08:52.867 --> 08:53.800
I'll be happy to...

08:53.867 --> 08:55.333
I hear you're a tramp, Rose.

08:57.500 --> 08:59.867
Mama was right. Word gets around fast.

09:00.767 --> 09:04.300
I've been dating this guy,
and I really like him.

09:04.367 --> 09:07.433
Oh, Ma, honey, that's wonderful.

09:07.500 --> 09:09.033
Girls, isn't that great?

09:09.100 --> 09:10.433
I'm the biggest slut.

09:12.100 --> 09:14.567
Sophia, don't you think
you might be rushing things?

09:14.633 --> 09:16.667
Please, the man is 86.

09:16.734 --> 09:19.533
Right now, it's a race
between me and the blood clot in his leg

09:19.600 --> 09:20.867
to see who gets him first.

09:22.233 --> 09:23.834
So, what's the problem?

09:23.900 --> 09:28.333
His sister. It's weird.
We can't do anything without her.

09:28.700 --> 09:32.133
You know how hard it is to make out
when his sister's next to you?

09:32.200 --> 09:33.467
-Do I ever.
-Do I ever.

09:33.533 --> 09:35.600
Now, you stop that. You just stop that.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.834
Listen, Ma, I have an idea.

09:38.900 --> 09:44.066
I'll go pick up Marvin, bring him here,
and you two can be alone.

09:44.133 --> 09:46.300
We'll be in the lanai.

09:46.367 --> 09:48.133
You'll have the living room
all to yourselves.

09:48.200 --> 09:50.600
-You're willing to do this?
-Well, of course.

09:50.667 --> 09:54.400
Let's go pick out the teeth
you'll wear tonight.

10:01.433 --> 10:03.033
(laughing)

10:03.100 --> 10:06.867
You sound like you were quite a pistol
back in high school.

10:06.934 --> 10:10.166
-Well...
-I'll bet you had a nickname.

10:11.233 --> 10:12.133
I sure did.

10:12.834 --> 10:14.300
Tell her, Rose.

10:15.567 --> 10:19.266
(laughs)
No. It was your nickname.

10:19.333 --> 10:20.033
You tell her.

10:20.100 --> 10:21.567
Oh, okay.

10:22.066 --> 10:22.967
It was Skipper.

10:26.100 --> 10:28.500
Why skipper, 'cause you liked boats?

10:28.567 --> 10:29.667
No, I liked to skip.

10:31.400 --> 10:33.200
I got beat up a lot as a child.

10:36.233 --> 10:39.266
Well, were you and Rose really serious?

10:39.333 --> 10:40.400
Oh, you bet.

10:40.467 --> 10:45.000
In fact,
Rose Lidstrom gave me my first real kiss.

10:45.467 --> 10:46.600
I'll never forget that.

10:46.667 --> 10:47.667
Remember, Rose?

10:47.734 --> 10:49.633
Do I remember?

10:49.700 --> 10:51.400
Would anybody like some more wine?

10:51.467 --> 10:55.200
No. I have to visit the little boys' room.

10:55.700 --> 10:57.066
I'll be right back.

11:01.066 --> 11:02.400
Blanche, that's it!

11:02.467 --> 11:04.533
I remember who he is.

11:04.600 --> 11:05.333
Who?

11:05.400 --> 11:10.433
He took me to the valentine's dance
my senior year.

11:10.500 --> 11:13.367
I asked Thor to take me
to make Charlie jealous.

11:13.834 --> 11:15.533
Oh, I feel awful.

11:16.100 --> 11:17.633
I used Thor.

11:17.700 --> 11:19.667
You say that like it's something bad.

11:20.934 --> 11:25.166
Blanche, this is serious.
He thinks I cared for him, and I didn't.

11:25.734 --> 11:28.400
Thor, I have a confession to make.

11:28.467 --> 11:29.333
No, Rose.

11:29.400 --> 11:31.633
I have a confession to make, please.

11:32.900 --> 11:37.934
It has taken me nine years,
ever since I heard Charlie passed away,

11:38.000 --> 11:40.767
to get up the nerve to say this.

11:41.800 --> 11:47.133
Nine years to build up the courage
to tell you how I feel.

11:48.166 --> 11:52.233
Nine years to save enough money
for the bus to Miami.

11:54.333 --> 11:55.600
I love you, Rose.

11:55.667 --> 11:57.133
I've always loved you.

11:57.200 --> 12:01.600
I've waited a long time for you,
and I've come to take you home with me.

12:03.233 --> 12:05.533
Now, what's your confession?

12:07.734 --> 12:09.800
My roommate doesn't wear underwear.

12:16.900 --> 12:19.300
Since this is our fourth date,

12:19.367 --> 12:21.700
I wouldn't blame you
if you tried to kiss me.

12:21.767 --> 12:24.567
That's because you're very understanding.

12:25.033 --> 12:26.767
Maybe I'm being a little too subtle here.

12:27.500 --> 12:28.834
Give me your hand, Marvin.

12:31.734 --> 12:33.767
Now, what do you feel?

12:33.834 --> 12:35.467
A medic alert tag?

12:36.967 --> 12:38.967
Can't you feel my heart pounding?

12:39.433 --> 12:41.500
-Would anyone--
-Get out! Get out! Get out!

12:44.433 --> 12:46.700
Sophia, we shouldn't be doing this.

12:46.767 --> 12:48.200
Sarah's going to be here soon.

12:48.266 --> 12:52.200
I know you two are close,
but she's getting on my nerves.

12:52.266 --> 12:56.133
-You mustn't speak about Sarah like that.
-Wake up.

12:56.200 --> 12:58.600
The woman's a control freak.
Get rid of her.

12:58.667 --> 12:59.934
No! Don't say that!

13:00.000 --> 13:02.400
A sister shouldn't run your life.

13:02.467 --> 13:04.400
She's not my sister. She's my wife.

13:09.233 --> 13:10.166
Dorothy...

13:11.533 --> 13:12.900
You can come in now.

13:14.533 --> 13:18.066
I thought you two would like
some nice, cool lemonade.

13:18.533 --> 13:20.600
Marvin is married to Sarah.

13:22.100 --> 13:23.700
You don't get any lemonade.

13:25.834 --> 13:29.266
I didn't mean to just blurt it out,
but I can explain.

13:29.333 --> 13:32.367
You and your daughter
must have a lot of questions.

13:32.433 --> 13:33.834
You bet.

13:34.266 --> 13:36.867
By the way, Dorothy's not my daughter,
she's my lesbian lover.

13:44.233 --> 13:45.567
Ma.

13:45.633 --> 13:48.133
See, Marvin, how do you like it?
Not a pretty picture, is it?

13:49.967 --> 13:51.967
Marvin, what's going on here?

13:52.033 --> 13:54.734
Obviously, they put an ad in the magazine

13:54.800 --> 13:58.867
to lure an unsuspecting cutie like me
into their web of sex games.

13:59.600 --> 14:01.333
They want me to be their love slave.

14:03.100 --> 14:04.734
(doorbell rings)

14:09.900 --> 14:10.867
Hi.

14:10.934 --> 14:12.467
I've come to pick up my brother.

14:12.533 --> 14:14.100
Well, if it isn't Mrs. Caligula.

14:15.600 --> 14:17.066
Come on in, and pull up a whip.

14:18.633 --> 14:21.233
You two have a lot of explaining to do.

14:21.300 --> 14:22.667
I'm sorry, Sarah.

14:23.166 --> 14:24.633
I told them we're married.

14:25.800 --> 14:26.900
Oh, dear.

14:27.767 --> 14:29.333
Why did you lie to my mother?

14:29.400 --> 14:31.533
I didn't want to lie.

14:31.600 --> 14:32.266
(whimpers)

14:32.333 --> 14:36.900
We were going to tell the truth
when we knew Sophia was the one we wanted.

14:36.967 --> 14:38.367
Then it is true!

14:39.867 --> 14:43.667
You wanted my mother for... sex games.

14:44.433 --> 14:46.967
Oh, God, this is so unbelievable.

14:47.900 --> 14:49.266
It's not that unbelievable.

14:51.767 --> 14:55.467
Sophia, the truth of the matter is...

14:56.567 --> 14:57.767
I'm dying.

14:58.600 --> 15:01.467
My doctors say
I have very few months left.

15:02.133 --> 15:06.533
And I told Marvin
that I won't be able to rest in peace

15:06.600 --> 15:09.433
unless I know that he has someone else.

15:10.300 --> 15:12.066
That's where you come in, Sophia.

15:13.333 --> 15:15.800
I want you to take my place.

15:17.367 --> 15:20.066
(sad music playing)

15:23.300 --> 15:25.967
(mellow music playing)

15:26.467 --> 15:29.166
Again,
we're sorry for springing this on you.

15:29.233 --> 15:31.033
I know it came as quite a shock.

15:31.100 --> 15:32.900
Our hearts go out to both of you.

15:32.967 --> 15:36.433
And as soon as Ma and I have talked,
we'll get back to you.

15:37.333 --> 15:41.200
-So, you'll seriously consider this?
-Well, of course we will.

15:41.266 --> 15:42.700
How could we not?

15:43.667 --> 15:45.367
What a pair of loons.

15:48.533 --> 15:49.633
Ma, this does it.

15:49.700 --> 15:52.033
No more of this manhunt nonsense.

15:52.100 --> 15:53.400
I'm getting you a plant.

15:56.567 --> 15:57.533
What a night.

15:57.600 --> 15:58.867
Tell me about it.

15:58.934 --> 16:02.066
Sarah isn't Marvin's sister.
She's his wife.

16:02.133 --> 16:05.200
She's dying,
and she wants Ma to replace her.

16:06.033 --> 16:09.967
This is why she's been on all their dates
and asks so many questions.

16:10.033 --> 16:12.834
Ever since she found out
what her prognosis is,

16:12.900 --> 16:17.533
she and Marvin have been searching
desperately to find a replacement.

16:17.600 --> 16:19.967
And the replacement, my mother.

16:20.033 --> 16:22.433
Sophia, I know how much you liked Marvin.

16:22.500 --> 16:24.700
I'm sorry it didn't work out.

16:25.467 --> 16:26.500
I'm going to do it.

16:26.567 --> 16:28.500
Ma, you can't be serious.

16:29.166 --> 16:30.433
Sarah is dying.

16:30.500 --> 16:35.233
It's terrible, but I can't change that,
and I really care for Marvin,

16:35.300 --> 16:37.934
and if we can all be happy together
and not be alone,

16:38.667 --> 16:40.000
what's wrong with that?

16:41.734 --> 16:44.734
(mellow music playing)

16:49.266 --> 16:50.767
(doorbell rings)

16:50.834 --> 16:51.967
That's Thor.

16:52.467 --> 16:54.867
Blanche, would you mind?
We're going to need our privacy.

16:54.934 --> 16:57.400
Now, Rose, that's not fair.

16:57.467 --> 16:59.467
I want to see you dump him.

17:00.934 --> 17:03.800
I let you watch
when I broke up with my last guy.

17:03.867 --> 17:05.066
No, you didn't.

17:05.133 --> 17:08.667
Oh, really, well I have it on video tape,
would you like to see it?

17:09.967 --> 17:11.266
Get out.

17:16.467 --> 17:19.066
Rose, you sounded so strange on the phone.

17:19.133 --> 17:20.433
Is something wrong?

17:20.500 --> 17:21.333
Tell me.

17:21.400 --> 17:25.233
-Why don't we sit down first?
-Oh, boy.

17:25.300 --> 17:26.166
(laughs)

17:26.233 --> 17:28.567
You and me snuggling on a couch.

17:28.633 --> 17:30.567
Brings back memories, doesn't it?

17:30.633 --> 17:32.800
Actually, no.

17:32.867 --> 17:34.767
That's what I want to talk to you about.

17:35.367 --> 17:37.066
Ever since you got here,

17:37.133 --> 17:40.467
you've talked about things we did
and things we said.

17:40.834 --> 17:42.633
I don't remember any of it.

17:42.700 --> 17:44.433
So, you don't remember every detail.

17:44.500 --> 17:46.734
At least you remember what's important.

17:47.433 --> 17:48.734
You remember the kiss.

17:49.266 --> 17:50.533
Our first kiss.

17:51.700 --> 17:54.533
This doesn't make any sense.

17:55.200 --> 18:00.400
Rose, maybe you don't remember
because you've suffered some brain damage.

18:02.500 --> 18:05.667
(Blanche laughs)

18:06.834 --> 18:11.700
The one thing I do remember
is I only went out with you

18:11.767 --> 18:13.133
because of Charlie Nylund.

18:13.767 --> 18:16.066
I used you to make Charlie jealous.

18:16.133 --> 18:18.700
It was Charlie I loved, not you.

18:19.333 --> 18:20.400
Oh.

18:21.033 --> 18:24.700
I feel so stupid...

18:25.500 --> 18:27.834
So incredibly stupid.

18:28.567 --> 18:30.367
You know what it's like
to feel this stupid?

18:30.433 --> 18:32.600
(Blanche laughs)

18:36.266 --> 18:37.266
(Blanche) Ow!

18:40.033 --> 18:44.033
Well, I probably should go now.
I've bothered you enough.

18:44.100 --> 18:46.133
I'm so sorry, Thor.

18:46.200 --> 18:47.900
I'm sorry I don't remember.

18:47.967 --> 18:49.934
(chuckles)
Me, too.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.567
-Rose?
-What?

19:03.967 --> 19:05.967
Maybe that will last me another 40 years.

19:06.934 --> 19:08.734
It was the haystack!

19:08.800 --> 19:09.734
What?

19:09.800 --> 19:11.300
Our first kiss.

19:11.367 --> 19:13.800
It was at night, and the air was crisp.

19:13.867 --> 19:16.433
You were wearing a blue
and white striped shirt.

19:16.934 --> 19:18.200
We were in a haystack.

19:18.266 --> 19:20.734
Yes! Yes, that's it!
(laughs)

19:20.800 --> 19:22.600
But you said you couldn't remember.

19:22.667 --> 19:24.633
I guess I just needed a little help.

19:24.700 --> 19:26.934
Thank you, Rose.

19:27.800 --> 19:28.500
Thank you.

19:29.567 --> 19:31.166
You don't know what that means to me.

19:41.433 --> 19:45.166
Rose, you remembered.
A kiss unlocked your memory.

19:45.233 --> 19:47.567
One doesn't forget a kiss like that.

19:47.633 --> 19:49.433
Oh, that's so romantic.

19:49.500 --> 19:50.500
No, it isn't.

19:51.066 --> 19:53.467
That man didn't know how to kiss
40 years ago,

19:53.533 --> 19:54.967
and he doesn't know how to kiss today.

20:01.500 --> 20:04.033
Now that we've finalized
our little arrangement,

20:04.100 --> 20:06.000
I'd like to propose a toast.

20:06.600 --> 20:10.967
To Sophia, whose generosity
and kindness of spirit

20:11.033 --> 20:14.266
have given us a gift beyond measure.

20:14.834 --> 20:16.600
I, too, have a toast.

20:18.166 --> 20:21.967
I predict nothing but disaster and tragedy

20:22.834 --> 20:26.500
for everyone connected
with this travesty of an idea.

20:28.266 --> 20:30.667
She's not going to be living with us,
is she?

20:33.934 --> 20:37.100
I hope you're not boring Sophia
with those photos.

20:37.166 --> 20:38.767
He's not. I'm enjoying it.

20:38.834 --> 20:41.100
Here's one taken when we first met.

20:41.166 --> 20:42.767
Sarah, tell the story.

20:42.834 --> 20:44.100
They don't want to hear that.

20:44.166 --> 20:45.300
Sure, we do.

20:45.367 --> 20:48.467
Well, when I was 19,

20:48.533 --> 20:50.467
I answered the door one day

20:50.533 --> 20:53.800
to find the most handsome man
I'd ever seen.

20:55.367 --> 20:59.266
He was selling encyclopedias,
and I told him,

20:59.333 --> 21:02.867
"Right now,
I can only afford to buy volume one.

21:02.934 --> 21:05.734
If you come back next week,
maybe I could buy more."

21:06.333 --> 21:10.300
So, for the very next year,
he came every week,

21:10.367 --> 21:12.633
and I would buy one volume at a time

21:13.233 --> 21:16.300
until I realized I had three sets
of encyclopedias

21:16.367 --> 21:18.533
and I'd go broke unless I married him.

21:18.600 --> 21:20.166
(both laugh)

21:20.233 --> 21:21.433
Oh.

21:25.533 --> 21:27.600
Well, now, where were we?

21:27.667 --> 21:28.567
Oh, yes.

21:28.633 --> 21:32.533
I feel a lot better now
that we've got everything settled.

21:32.600 --> 21:35.567
-I think we ought to--
-I can't do it.

21:37.066 --> 21:38.500
I can't go through with this.

21:38.567 --> 21:39.867
Ma, what's wrong?

21:39.934 --> 21:41.667
What are you talking about?

21:41.734 --> 21:43.367
This just isn't going to work.

21:44.133 --> 21:47.467
I was doing this because I wanted to help,
because I know what it's like

21:47.533 --> 21:49.533
to lose the most important person
in your life,

21:49.600 --> 21:51.600
but this isn't right.

21:53.333 --> 21:54.667
Look, Marvin, I like you,

21:54.734 --> 21:57.133
but I saw how you looked at Sarah
a moment ago.

21:57.567 --> 22:00.367
You could never look at me that way.

22:00.433 --> 22:03.767
Do you realize how hard it was
to find you?

22:03.834 --> 22:06.367
Do you realize how much time we've wasted?

22:06.433 --> 22:08.200
The only time you're wasting

22:08.567 --> 22:12.100
is the time that you and Marvin
should spend together.

22:12.166 --> 22:15.066
You're wrong. This is what Marvin wants.

22:15.133 --> 22:17.066
No, it isn't. Dorothy's right.

22:17.133 --> 22:19.433
-What?
-I never wanted this.

22:19.500 --> 22:23.066
I only went along
because it meant so much to you.

22:23.734 --> 22:26.533
I only did it to make you happy.

22:26.600 --> 22:31.066
Sarah, dear,
can't we just be together, the two of us?

22:31.734 --> 22:34.600
I feel so guilty for leaving you.

22:35.266 --> 22:35.934
Don't.

22:37.066 --> 22:39.000
I'll be along soon enough.

22:39.633 --> 22:40.300
Oh!

22:47.166 --> 22:47.834
Ma.

22:53.600 --> 22:56.100
I guess we've all learned something
from this.

22:56.166 --> 22:56.900
Yeah.

22:57.567 --> 22:59.900
You can never replace someone you've lost,

22:59.967 --> 23:03.533
and I'm only answering ads
from Blanche's magazines.

23:03.600 --> 23:05.367
Those people know what they want.

23:12.800 --> 23:17.533
"Retired clergyman seeks companion
for European tour of ancient cathedrals.

23:17.900 --> 23:19.066
No prudes."

23:20.300 --> 23:21.700
Circle that. Big star.

23:23.266 --> 23:24.200
Okay.

23:24.266 --> 23:25.200
Here's another one.

23:25.900 --> 23:29.467
"Recently devastated man seeks companion.

23:29.533 --> 23:34.066
Enjoys walks in the rain,
midnight swims, and skipping"?

23:36.433 --> 23:38.667
What kind of a jerk
would date a guy like that?
