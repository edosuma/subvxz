they are taking out

Press is getting loaded up

They think
it's a winner?

They do.
There's more.

03:49.708 --> 03:51.208
Charles Rhoades Sr.
did take

03:51.208 --> 03:52.542
an Uncle Miltie-sized position
in the company.

03:52.542 --> 03:56.125
I've run through it
with the primes all over town,

03:56.125 --> 03:58.166

the other guy's,

03:58.166 --> 04:00.000

at the big three,

04:00.000 --> 04:01.291
as well
as our own people.

04:01.291 --> 04:03.041
They all agree
with Patriot.

04:03.041 --> 04:04.041
- Fundamentals?
- Solid.

04:04.041 --> 04:06.625
The projections
are real.

04:06.625 --> 04:08.750
They're rolling out
the IPO soon.

04:08.750 --> 04:10.625
Everyone thinks
it's gonna work.

04:10.625 --> 04:12.875
No one sees a short play
we can make.

04:12.875 --> 04:14.750
I don't see
an avenue of attack.

04:14.750 --> 04:16.875
Personnel?
The fucking lawyer,

04:16.875 --> 04:19.792
Ira Schirmer, represented
Rhoades at your deposition.

04:19.792 --> 04:20.750
He's got a board seat.

04:20.750 --> 04:23.625
Rhoades' father
and his closest confidante

04:23.625 --> 04:27.417
have both jumped headfirst
into a business...together?

04:27.417 --> 04:28.250
And you amble in here
to tell me

04:28.250 --> 04:30.667
that I have no way
to wreck it?

04:30.667 --> 04:31.875
Fuck.

04:31.875 --> 04:33.458
This is  Sonny

04:43.583 --> 04:45.708
Top sheet
says Charles Rhoades Sr.

04:45.708 --> 04:47.583
is a high-net-worth
individual. He has

04:47.583 --> 04:50.208
multiple business holdings,
mostly in real estate.

04:50.208 --> 04:52.583
But at the moment,
it seems he's largely illiquid

04:52.583 --> 04:54.417
because of some new
cash-intensive

04:54.417 --> 04:55.041
real-estate investments.

04:55.041 --> 04:56.417

City co-op, Hamptons place,

04:59.792 --> 05:01.458
a hobby farm
in Mount Kisco,

05:01.458 --> 05:03.250
an ocean-front spread
in Florida.

05:03.250 --> 05:05.417
And upstate, he bought up
half of Kingsford.

05:05.417 --> 05:07.291
But he won't be able to flip
that land for a real profit

05:07.291 --> 05:10.834
until the casino
is in and open.

05:10.834 --> 05:12.875
And so
the question is...

05:12.875 --> 05:15.583
Yes. Where did he get the
capital for the juice company?

05:15.583 --> 05:17.375
I did a forensic look,
and I cannot find the source.

05:17.375 --> 05:19.583
Which means there's no
institutional money

05:19.583 --> 05:22.792
behind the purchase
of his share of Ice Juice.

05:22.792 --> 05:24.458
It had to be a personal loan
of some sort.

05:26.458 --> 05:26.959
Okay. Good.

05:26.959 --> 05:29.834
Thank you, Taylor.

05:33.917 --> 05:36.333
So, Rhoades Sr.
got his money for Ice Juice

05:36.333 --> 05:38.500
from a personal loan.

05:38.500 --> 05:41.959
Had to be someone
very close to him

05:41.959 --> 05:43.166
to lend him
that kind of jack.

05:43.166 --> 05:47.458

Yes. The next time
Axe showed on campus,

35:50.166 --> 35:52.542

a smart question,

35:52.542 --> 35:55.291
one that I had thought about,
planned out ahead of time,

35:55.291 --> 35:57.375
and he said to see him
when I got out,

35:57.375 --> 35:58.375
he'd find a place
for me. He did.

35:58.375 --> 36:02.458
But I figured
he'd be like my coach here,

36:02.458 --> 36:06.041

been that...at all.
