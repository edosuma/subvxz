WEBVTT

00:09.709 --> 00:12.077
Sit down and put
your seat belt on.

00:12.079 --> 00:14.380
Pretty safety-conscious
for a fugitive.

00:14.382 --> 00:15.214
(cell phone alarm beeping)

00:15.216 --> 00:18.250
Elizabeth put out
an AMBER Alert?

00:18.252 --> 00:21.186
Oh, my height chart.

00:21.188 --> 00:24.023
This is new.
My mom wrote this.

00:24.025 --> 00:25.491
Okay.
What is it?

00:25.493 --> 00:28.060
I don't know, but
I'm gonna write it down.

00:28.762 --> 00:30.763
My mom would have seen
the AMBER Alert.

00:30.765 --> 00:33.298
We need to go leave
a message for her with Max.

00:33.300 --> 00:35.601
Just tell the cops
you had a gun in your face.

00:35.603 --> 00:37.236
Crash, what the hell
are you doing?

00:37.238 --> 00:39.972
The saftey's on.
See?

00:40.807 --> 00:42.708
(Carter)
What did you do?

00:42.710 --> 00:43.942
Call 911.

00:43.944 --> 00:46.045
What should--
What should I do?

00:46.047 --> 00:47.312
(Carter crying)

00:47.314 --> 00:50.716
Currently, Max is
non-responsive.

00:51.418 --> 00:53.252
I'm gonna make it up
to everyone,

00:53.254 --> 00:55.220
but especially to you.

00:55.222 --> 00:56.688
If you care
about Max so much,

00:56.690 --> 00:57.589
why don't you devote your time

00:57.591 --> 00:59.358
to finding your
fugitive boyfriend

00:59.360 --> 01:00.526
and getting him arrested?

01:00.528 --> 01:03.429
He's obviously a very
unstable person.

01:03.431 --> 01:05.364
He just wants
to say good-bye.

01:05.366 --> 01:05.998
You can't go.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.667
Carter, if I can see
that he's scum,
how can you not?

01:08.669 --> 01:11.904
This is love.
This is that unbearable feeling

01:11.906 --> 01:14.440
that never goes away.

01:14.442 --> 01:16.108
(sirens blaring)

01:16.110 --> 01:18.977
Let me see your hands!
You're under arrest.

01:18.979 --> 01:19.711
Crash!

01:19.713 --> 01:20.946
Get her away from here.

01:20.948 --> 01:22.748
I knew you were
gonna follow me,

01:22.750 --> 01:24.917
'cause you're my mom.

01:27.287 --> 01:29.188
Please don't give up
on me.

Hey.

02:32.987 --> 02:34.186
Hey.

02:38.691 --> 02:40.425
Why you looking
at a zip code?

02:40.427 --> 02:41.426
This is a zip code?

02:41.428 --> 02:43.729
I thought zip codes
only had five numbers.

02:43.731 --> 02:46.465
Plus four, so your bills
can get to you faster.

02:46.467 --> 02:49.301
Why are you
so interested in that?

02:51.404 --> 02:54.406
Sure, you can use
my computer.

02:54.408 --> 02:55.941
Uh, sorry,
I just need to, um...

02:55.943 --> 02:58.277
You need to what?

03:01.915 --> 03:03.348
This building has
its own zip code?

03:03.350 --> 03:06.351
Yeah, mail delivery
became really efficient

03:06.353 --> 03:08.787
just when we stopped
using it.

03:08.789 --> 03:10.556
Wait a second.

03:10.558 --> 03:13.425
(Elizabeth)
Is that Montgomery Village,
Maryland?

03:13.427 --> 03:14.993
Yeah, why?
Is that significant?

03:14.995 --> 03:20.299
Yeah, your dad and I had
our first apartment
together there.

03:28.174 --> 03:29.374
Hi.
Hi.

03:29.376 --> 03:33.312
I'm, um, picking up photos
for Carter Stevens.

03:33.314 --> 03:36.014
Okay.
I think.

03:36.016 --> 03:38.984
Uh, "Stevens" did you say?
Mm-hmm.

03:38.986 --> 03:40.719
Could it be under
a different name or something?

03:40.721 --> 03:44.389
Um, yeah, I guess.
But I--

03:44.391 --> 03:45.991
I don't know what
it would be.

03:45.993 --> 03:46.692
When was it dropped off?

03:46.694 --> 03:48.260
Could it have been more
than a month ago?

03:48.262 --> 03:52.364
'Cause that's
in a different drawer.

03:52.366 --> 03:55.634
Oh, it was three months ago.
Here we go.

03:55.636 --> 03:57.836
Stevens, Carter.
Prepaid.

03:57.838 --> 04:00.772
Oh.

04:00.774 --> 04:03.342
Thanks.

Hello?

04:53.327 --> 04:54.693
(woman)
Elizabeth Wilson?

04:54.695 --> 04:56.061
This is?
Claire Gregory.

04:56.063 --> 04:59.298
I'm the youth counselor
for the crisis response team.

04:59.300 --> 05:00.332
<i>We're with the mayor's office.</i>

05:00.334 --> 05:02.734
Yeah, I work in
law enforcement--
I know the program.

05:02.736 --> 05:04.770
I'm calling about
your daughter Carter.

05:04.772 --> 05:08.140
She's had some significant
trauma in her live recently.

05:08.142 --> 05:10.342
Uh, yeah,
to put it mildly.

05:10.344 --> 05:11.643
But, um, therapy?

05:11.645 --> 05:13.845
I'm sorry,
but Carter is not a fan.

05:13.847 --> 05:14.746
That's pretty standard.

05:14.748 --> 05:17.316
Teenagers often resist
going to therapy.

05:17.318 --> 05:18.884
When teenagers bury
their issues,

05:18.886 --> 05:22.621
they manifest themselves
in destructive behavior.

05:22.623 --> 05:23.855
We could just
schedule a session.

05:23.857 --> 05:25.791
You can always cancel
if Carter says no.

05:25.793 --> 05:27.159
Great, that's what
we'll do.

05:27.161 --> 05:29.761
I have an opening
tomorrow, 1:00.

05:29.763 --> 05:31.263
Okay.
Great.

05:31.265 --> 05:33.899
Thank you.
Thank you.

05:33.901 --> 05:35.467
(phone beeps off)

05:51.017 --> 05:54.386
Do you have a secret
stash of cookies?

05:54.388 --> 05:56.688
You caught me.
Can I have one?

05:56.690 --> 05:58.890
No.
I can't have one cookie?

05:58.892 --> 06:00.225
They're not cookies.

06:00.227 --> 06:01.093
Money?

06:01.095 --> 06:04.329
You might as well
just stop guessing,
I'm not gonna tell you.

06:05.798 --> 06:06.865
Porn?

06:06.867 --> 06:07.799
Porn.

06:07.801 --> 06:08.400
Love letters.

06:08.402 --> 06:10.902
Carter, I'm not playing
this game.

06:10.904 --> 06:12.170
It's love letters, isn't it?
I knew it.

06:12.172 --> 06:13.438
They're not love letters.

06:13.440 --> 06:15.340
They're little notes.

06:15.342 --> 06:16.441
He used to write me
little notes,

06:16.443 --> 06:19.978
and put 'em
in obscure places
where I could find them.

06:19.980 --> 06:22.381
And this morning,
he put one

06:22.383 --> 06:24.883
underneath my
coffee mug.

06:24.885 --> 06:29.821
And it just said...
"Remember me?"

06:29.823 --> 06:35.193
And I thought,
yeah... I remember.

06:35.195 --> 06:37.295
This is full of 'em.

06:37.297 --> 06:40.599
This is all before
you were born.

06:43.503 --> 06:46.938
You mean...

06:46.940 --> 06:49.941
kind of around
this time?

07:05.825 --> 07:10.695
Carter, where did you
get these pictures?

07:13.966 --> 07:17.002
Lori.

07:29.015 --> 07:31.683
Lori Stevens took
these pictures?

07:31.685 --> 07:33.885
How's that possible?
This is...

07:33.887 --> 07:35.887
three years before
we even knew her.

07:35.889 --> 07:37.522
Well, maybe she didn't
take them.

07:37.524 --> 07:38.623
That's unlikely.

07:38.625 --> 07:41.326
But...
(sighs)

07:41.328 --> 07:43.562
these pictures are
so creepy.

07:43.564 --> 07:48.066
Whoever took them was,
like... stalking you.

07:48.068 --> 07:52.704
Carter, you're not going to like
what I'm about to say.

07:53.806 --> 07:55.173
What?

07:55.175 --> 07:57.008
As you can see, I'm pregnant
in these pictures.

07:57.010 --> 07:59.444
Three years later,
Lori Stevens kidnaps you.

07:59.446 --> 08:03.515
And then we find you,
and she leads you
back to these pictures.

08:03.517 --> 08:05.350
We do have a stalker.

08:05.352 --> 08:06.852
It's Lori Stevens.

08:06.854 --> 08:08.920
And she wants us
to know it.

08:08.922 --> 08:10.689
Yeah, you're right,
I didn't want to hear that.

08:10.691 --> 08:12.290
All this time I thought
I was investigating

08:12.292 --> 08:14.426
what I thought was
just a kidnapping.

08:14.428 --> 08:15.527
Clearly it wasn't.

08:15.529 --> 08:16.261
What was it, then?

08:16.263 --> 08:18.029
It was like
some kind of hit.

08:18.031 --> 08:18.864
We were targeted.

08:18.866 --> 08:20.065
No, that doesn't make sense.

08:20.067 --> 08:21.366
She didn't even know us.

08:21.368 --> 08:22.868
But why would she
take these photos

08:22.870 --> 08:23.902
if you didn't even
know her?

08:23.904 --> 08:27.005
I don't know.
Stalkers are crazy people.

08:27.007 --> 08:30.709
I was raised by
your stalker?

08:32.078 --> 08:33.111
Oh, my God.

08:33.113 --> 08:34.646
Do you remember
when we first met her?

08:34.648 --> 08:35.814
She was doing hospice work
on our street.

08:35.816 --> 08:38.016
Yeah, well, she said
she was doing hospice work.

08:38.018 --> 08:39.017
She probably didn't even
have a job.

08:39.019 --> 08:42.654
She moved into the neighborhood
so she could be near us.

08:42.656 --> 08:43.755
I'm such an idiot.

08:43.757 --> 08:45.357
I invited her
into our home

08:45.359 --> 08:50.028
and let her play with
our three-year-old daughters.

08:50.030 --> 08:52.130
I made it easy for her.

08:52.132 --> 08:56.368
Did she even want me?

08:56.370 --> 08:58.136
What do you mean?

08:58.138 --> 09:01.573
Well, she was stalking <i>you</i>
<i>for years.</i>

09:01.575 --> 09:03.909
What, all because she wanted
a three-year-old child?

09:03.911 --> 09:04.943
It doesn't make
any sense.

09:04.945 --> 09:07.712
None of this makes
any sense.

09:07.714 --> 09:11.149
Carter...

09:15.988 --> 09:17.889
I told you a while back

09:17.891 --> 09:20.792
that I was gonna stop
looking for Lori.

09:22.228 --> 09:23.628
No.

09:23.630 --> 09:27.599
I don't think you should
stop looking for her.

09:29.068 --> 09:31.670
I think you should
keep going.

09:33.906 --> 09:36.207
And I want to help you.

09:42.882 --> 09:45.383
Are you sure you want
to do this?

09:45.385 --> 09:47.786
Just a couple
of days ago,

09:47.788 --> 09:50.689
you thought of her
as your mother.

09:50.691 --> 09:58.229
Yeah, but...
because she's not.

09:59.131 --> 10:02.233
In fact, I don't even
really know her real name.

10:02.235 --> 10:03.501
I don't even know
if she wanted a kid,

10:03.503 --> 10:06.371
or if she just took me
because she wanted
to hurt you.

10:06.373 --> 10:07.839
Why would she want
to hurt us?

10:07.841 --> 10:09.808
(cell phones chime, vibrate)

10:09.810 --> 10:11.810
(Elizabeth)
Oh, my God.

10:11.812 --> 10:13.078
Max is awake.

10:13.080 --> 10:15.680
They're moving him
to a regular room.

10:18.050 --> 10:21.019
Thank God.
Come on, let's go.

10:22.521 --> 10:25.023
Did you get my note?

10:25.025 --> 10:27.792
Yeah.
It's nice.

10:29.195 --> 10:31.096
Come on.

10:38.237 --> 10:41.306
(monitor beeping steadily)

10:43.743 --> 10:45.877
Max.

10:45.879 --> 10:47.212
Careful.

10:47.214 --> 10:50.382
(Carter)
I'm sorry.

10:50.384 --> 10:52.450
(crying)

10:58.157 --> 11:00.558
Hey.

11:00.560 --> 11:02.627
Everything hurts.

11:02.629 --> 11:05.330
I felt pretty good
while I was hurting, though.

11:06.932 --> 11:09.668
I'm so sorry.
Aw...

11:09.670 --> 11:11.336
I'm so sorry.

11:11.338 --> 11:15.040
Can you ever forgive me?

11:15.042 --> 11:17.242
Of course.

11:19.478 --> 11:21.680
God, you look horrible.

11:21.682 --> 11:24.849
Hey, sunshine.
Yeah.

11:24.851 --> 11:27.052
I'm just happy
to hear you talk.

11:27.054 --> 11:30.221
Mostly all I do
is complain.

11:30.223 --> 11:31.756
Well, we'll take it.

11:31.758 --> 11:32.624
I'll take anything.

11:32.626 --> 11:36.227
I bet you've been
getting pretty good
at Zombie Lord, though.

11:36.229 --> 11:38.563
(Grant)
Well, you're still
all-time champ,

11:38.565 --> 11:40.165
but nobody will ever
beat your score.

11:40.167 --> 11:42.267
Well, you got some time
to, like, catch up, then, huh?

11:42.269 --> 11:44.602
(David)
You just need
a little rehab.

11:44.604 --> 11:46.004
You'll be back at it
in no time.

11:46.006 --> 11:47.672
They keep saying
a lot of rehab.

11:47.674 --> 11:53.812
Got my parents a little worried
about that cash flow situation.

11:53.814 --> 11:57.415
I sound very depressing.
I'm sorry about that.

11:57.417 --> 12:00.018
Max, you couldn't be depressing,
even if you tried.

12:00.020 --> 12:03.121
Heard I made a mess
at the Mini-Mart.

12:03.123 --> 12:05.123
Probably lost
that job, huh?
(laughs)

12:05.125 --> 12:08.860
All right, I didn't mean
you should try.

12:11.263 --> 12:13.098
Somebody else,
you should say something.

12:13.100 --> 12:17.535
I feel like the guy
bringing down the room here.

12:20.306 --> 12:24.342
Well, I am getting
a "D" in science.

12:24.344 --> 12:25.210
You are?
What?

12:25.212 --> 12:26.377
Why would you
bring that up?

12:26.379 --> 12:27.679
Because I'm trying
to help Max out.

12:27.681 --> 12:29.881
He doesn't want to be the guy
bringing down the room,

12:29.883 --> 12:30.949
so I figured, okay,
I'll do it.

12:30.951 --> 12:34.619
You big palooka, get over here
and give me a hug.

12:34.621 --> 12:38.022
A little noggin nuzzle,
then go study.

12:38.024 --> 12:40.391
Rest time for studying.

12:47.833 --> 12:50.101
Hey.
Hey.
Come here.

12:51.036 --> 12:52.737
Okay, bear with me.

12:52.739 --> 12:53.505
This is a shot
in the dark,

12:53.507 --> 12:55.273
but you know that place
that you picked up the pictures?

12:55.275 --> 12:58.643
Well, across the street
there's an apartment complex.

12:58.645 --> 13:02.614
I pulled all the tenants
that lived there in July, 1997,

13:02.616 --> 13:03.748
and this is the list.

13:03.750 --> 13:06.551
Do you recognize
any of those names?

13:06.553 --> 13:09.020
No.
(frustrated sigh)

13:09.022 --> 13:09.888
I'm just wondering,
you know.

13:09.890 --> 13:12.557
Lori could have had those
pictures developed anywhere,

13:12.559 --> 13:13.758
but she chose this place.

13:13.760 --> 13:15.293
Why?
There must be a reason.

13:15.295 --> 13:18.596
I think she sent you there
for more than just pictures.

13:18.598 --> 13:21.299
I do know that
she was living

13:21.301 --> 13:25.470
in an apartment complex
in Fredericksburg
a couple of months ago,

13:25.472 --> 13:27.105
using the name
Catherine Riley.

13:27.107 --> 13:29.574
What?
How do you know that?

13:29.576 --> 13:33.044
You're not the only one
who's been doing police work.

13:33.046 --> 13:36.014
Anyone seen my keys?

13:36.016 --> 13:38.283
You're looking very
"Dead Poets Society" today.

13:38.285 --> 13:40.752
Okay, go ahead,
just make it quick

13:40.754 --> 13:43.888
'cause I don't have
a lot of time
for taunting this morning.

13:43.890 --> 13:44.989
Fine.
I'm done.

13:44.991 --> 13:46.124
Oh.
Whoa.

13:46.126 --> 13:48.326
Before you leave, could you
just look at this list?

13:48.328 --> 13:51.629
Do you recognize
any of those names?

13:51.631 --> 13:55.366
Mmm... no.
Sorry.

13:55.368 --> 13:57.302
Bye.
Bye.

13:57.304 --> 13:58.970
Call me.

13:58.972 --> 13:59.904
Or I'll call you?

13:59.906 --> 14:02.774
(chuckles)
Okay.

14:02.776 --> 14:04.342
(sighs)

14:04.344 --> 14:08.112
(door opens, closes)

14:08.114 --> 14:11.416
So, he left you
any more notes?

14:11.418 --> 14:15.186
No, not that I know of.

14:15.188 --> 14:18.923
All right.
Whoa, where are you going?

14:18.925 --> 14:20.758
I thought I'd go
to school.

14:20.760 --> 14:22.794
It's been a while,
and I'd really prefer

14:22.796 --> 14:24.062
not to have to
redo this year.

14:24.064 --> 14:27.131
Yeah. But you know,
what's--

14:27.133 --> 14:29.901
One more day's
not gonna hurt.

14:30.502 --> 14:32.804
All right, I know
I'm probably not
supposed to ask,

14:32.806 --> 14:35.640
but, um, why can't I
go to school?

14:35.642 --> 14:37.508
I have someone
coming over here

14:37.510 --> 14:39.143
to talk to you.

14:39.145 --> 14:41.346
She's a therapist

14:41.348 --> 14:42.280
Okay, come on, she--

14:42.282 --> 14:44.282
You know, she's not
just your regular shrink.

14:44.284 --> 14:47.285
She specializes
in teenagers with trauma.

14:47.287 --> 14:50.288
And you definitely have--

14:50.290 --> 14:54.726
Carter, you don't talk
to anybody.

14:54.728 --> 14:57.295
You haven't even
mentioned Crash.

14:58.664 --> 15:00.331
Yes, 'cause I heard
no bail.

15:00.333 --> 15:04.469
Yeah. Obviously
a flight risk.

15:10.209 --> 15:12.176
When's his arraignment?

15:12.178 --> 15:13.444
Thursday.

15:13.446 --> 15:16.281
You planning on going?

15:16.283 --> 15:19.050
I don't know.

15:20.853 --> 15:23.388
Carter...

15:23.390 --> 15:28.393
if you don't talk to me,
you have to talk to someone.

15:30.362 --> 15:33.364
Okay.

15:33.366 --> 15:35.633
(knock on door)

15:39.905 --> 15:41.606
(TV off)

15:45.711 --> 15:48.112
Hi, you must--

15:49.648 --> 15:51.516
Mom?

15:53.285 --> 15:55.753
Hi, baby.

16:00.693 --> 16:01.993
Well, can I come in?

16:01.995 --> 16:04.295
Uh, yeah, yeah, come in.

16:04.297 --> 16:06.431
Anyone else here?

16:06.433 --> 16:08.833
Um, no, just me.

16:13.906 --> 16:15.606
Mom, this is weird.

16:15.608 --> 16:19.544
Don't I at least
get a hug?

16:24.950 --> 16:25.984
So...

16:25.986 --> 16:27.151
how are they treating you?

16:27.153 --> 16:29.420
Mom, what are you
doing here?

16:29.422 --> 16:32.290
I wanted to see you.

16:32.292 --> 16:34.692
I miss you.

16:36.595 --> 16:38.162
Um...

16:38.164 --> 16:39.130
can I get a glass
of water?

16:39.132 --> 16:41.799
My throat is suddenly
just a little... yeah?

16:41.801 --> 16:45.837
Yeah, the, uh--
The kitchen's just...

16:51.610 --> 16:55.313
So I guess you like
having a family.

16:55.315 --> 16:57.315
Sister-- twin sister!

16:57.317 --> 16:59.183
Yeah, and a brother.

16:59.185 --> 17:00.852
Oh, he's new.

17:00.854 --> 17:04.589
Yeah, he's great.

17:05.557 --> 17:07.425
And your dad.

17:07.427 --> 17:11.162
What's it like
finally having a dad?

17:11.164 --> 17:12.830
Yeah, it's, um--

17:12.832 --> 17:14.532
It's had its
ups and downs.

17:14.534 --> 17:16.968
I bet.

17:16.970 --> 17:18.069
Stupid of me
to ever think

17:18.071 --> 17:20.104
I had a chance
of getting you back.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.841
No, it wasn't.

17:23.843 --> 17:26.878
I thought we were happy.

17:26.880 --> 17:28.679
We were.

17:28.681 --> 17:31.215
I didn't want to
let that go.

17:31.217 --> 17:34.218
Carter, I always,
always planned

17:34.220 --> 17:35.119
to tell you the truth.

17:35.121 --> 17:39.390
But I kept putting it off
and putting it off, and then--

17:39.392 --> 17:41.426
What did they tell you?

17:41.428 --> 17:42.593
Who?

17:42.595 --> 17:43.728
David and Elizabeth.

17:43.730 --> 17:46.464
I mean, they must have
told you their version,

17:46.466 --> 17:48.266
which, obviously,
was very convincing

17:48.268 --> 17:50.468
since David was the one
to call and tell me

17:50.470 --> 17:51.502
you picked them over me.

17:51.504 --> 17:52.637
I didn't pick them over you.

17:52.639 --> 17:54.639
I couldn't pick.
That was the point.

17:54.641 --> 17:56.174
You spent three months
with them.

17:56.176 --> 17:59.077
How does that wipe out
13 years with me?

17:59.079 --> 18:00.812
It doesn't, but, Mom,

18:00.814 --> 18:03.214
we shouldn't have
had those.

18:04.316 --> 18:07.819
You don't mean that.

18:09.421 --> 18:11.355
It was all based
on a lie.

18:11.357 --> 18:13.191
But that was
the only lie.

18:13.193 --> 18:16.627
Then find me a family
who lives with just
one single lie.

18:16.629 --> 18:18.396
I know you can't
say that about this one.

18:18.398 --> 18:20.565
No, I can't say that
about this one.

18:20.567 --> 18:25.069
What did they tell you
about me?

18:30.275 --> 18:32.143
(sighs)

18:32.145 --> 18:35.346
They said you were
their stalker.

18:35.348 --> 18:37.448
What?

18:37.450 --> 18:39.050
That is so typical.

18:39.052 --> 18:43.387
Where did they get
that I'm their stalker?

18:43.389 --> 18:45.189
From the pictures you took.

18:45.191 --> 18:48.759
But they told you why,
right-- why I took those?

18:48.761 --> 18:51.028
No, Mom, they don't know
why you took them.

18:51.030 --> 18:55.466
I'm just a crazy person
who randomly became

18:55.468 --> 18:56.367
obsessed with them.

18:56.369 --> 18:59.937
I mean, you didn't
buy that.

18:59.939 --> 19:01.873
Did you?

19:04.042 --> 19:06.244
You did.

19:06.246 --> 19:08.112
Yeah, I think I should go.
I'm gonna go.

19:08.114 --> 19:11.883
Mom! Then what,
are they lying to me?

19:11.885 --> 19:12.583
Tell me something.

19:12.585 --> 19:16.053
Baby, why would you believe
anything I say?

19:16.055 --> 19:20.391
I was gonna ask you
to give this to David,

19:20.393 --> 19:21.459
but now I think
you should keep it.

19:21.461 --> 19:23.528
They made it absolutely
impossible for me

19:23.530 --> 19:24.662
to ever tell you the truth.

19:24.664 --> 19:28.099
But you deserve
the truth.

19:28.101 --> 19:30.868
Get it from them.

19:30.870 --> 19:34.739
You were the very best part
of my life.

19:34.741 --> 19:38.809
The very, very best.

19:38.811 --> 19:40.978
You still call me Mom.

19:40.980 --> 19:44.215
So I'm your mom...
not Elizabeth?

19:48.554 --> 19:51.155
I'm sorry.

19:54.426 --> 19:56.727
It's okay.

19:56.729 --> 19:58.162
It's okay.
(chuckles)

19:58.164 --> 20:03.100
Hey...
this is your home.

20:03.102 --> 20:05.937
That's how it should be.

20:05.939 --> 20:10.675
But I will always think
of you as my baby.

20:10.677 --> 20:13.511
And I love you.

20:18.217 --> 20:21.519
Love you more.

20:21.521 --> 20:24.488
Not possible.

20:24.490 --> 20:26.224
Yes, possible.

20:36.535 --> 20:39.570
Cream of chicken!

20:39.572 --> 20:40.805
You love cream
of chicken!

20:40.807 --> 20:44.275
I do not love
cream of chicken.

20:44.277 --> 20:45.243
Yes, you do.

20:45.245 --> 20:47.645
You have, like,
ten cans of it
in your apartment.

20:47.647 --> 20:52.250
That's for donation.
Will you put that back on?

20:52.252 --> 20:55.686
You also have pudding,
apple sauce...

20:55.688 --> 20:57.054
I see all of that.

20:57.056 --> 20:59.590
Okay, we can start
with pudding.

21:03.528 --> 21:05.763
Taylor, I'm really
not hungry.

21:05.765 --> 21:06.764
Okay.

21:06.766 --> 21:07.965
I can go down
to the cafeteria

21:07.967 --> 21:09.734
and get you a milkshake.
Are you deaf?

21:09.736 --> 21:12.670
I just told you
I'm not hungry.

21:13.939 --> 21:16.107
Okay.

21:16.109 --> 21:18.843
I'll get this
out of your way.

21:21.346 --> 21:24.448
I'm sorry, I--

21:24.450 --> 21:28.519
I am mad at me.

21:29.454 --> 21:32.256
Max, why would you
be mad at yourself?

21:32.258 --> 21:34.692
'Cause I'm not getting it!

21:34.694 --> 21:36.694
I'm not getting
that I'm shot,

21:36.696 --> 21:37.828
and that I'm here.

21:37.830 --> 21:38.929
And I keep waking up
every morning

21:38.931 --> 21:42.566
thinking that I can go do
whatever I normally want to do,

21:42.568 --> 21:43.501
and I can't!

21:43.503 --> 21:44.235
I can't go to work,

21:44.237 --> 21:47.438
and I'm a little scared
about it!

21:48.940 --> 21:49.907
I wish I could help you,

21:49.909 --> 21:52.877
but I-- I don't know
how to help you.

21:55.280 --> 21:58.549
You can't,
but your mom can.

21:58.551 --> 21:59.784
My mom?

21:59.786 --> 22:03.487
I have to see that tape
from the Mini-Mart.

22:03.489 --> 22:04.555
No, you don't.
Yes.

22:04.557 --> 22:06.991
That's the only way I'm
gonna get it through my head

22:06.993 --> 22:08.492
of how I ended up here.

22:08.494 --> 22:10.695
Max, please, don't.

22:10.697 --> 22:13.764
Taylor, it's just not
up for discussion.

22:13.766 --> 22:16.567
Just tell your mom.

22:16.569 --> 22:19.003
Okay.

22:19.005 --> 22:21.472
If that's what you want.

22:23.275 --> 22:26.577
(door opens, closes)

22:26.579 --> 22:29.180
How was school?

22:29.182 --> 22:30.981
It was good.

22:30.983 --> 22:32.183
How 'bout you?

22:32.185 --> 22:34.852
I-- I didn't go.
Why not?

22:34.854 --> 22:37.988
I spent the day
with Lori.

22:39.524 --> 22:41.692
Lori?

22:41.694 --> 22:43.260
Where did you see her?

22:43.262 --> 22:44.562
Here.

22:44.564 --> 22:46.864
Lori came to the <i>house?</i>

22:46.866 --> 22:47.965
She came inside the house.

22:47.967 --> 22:50.434
Are you okay?
What-- What happened?

22:51.870 --> 22:55.773
She gave me this picture
of you.

23:08.153 --> 23:09.820
Where did she get this?

23:09.822 --> 23:11.422
She said she took it.

23:11.424 --> 23:13.023
She said she took it?

23:13.025 --> 23:15.593
So you didn't know her
in 1997?

23:15.595 --> 23:17.695
Carter, how can you
believe a woman

23:17.697 --> 23:20.865
who has lied to you
every day for 13 years?

23:23.068 --> 23:24.802
How can I believe a man

23:24.804 --> 23:26.937
who wrote a book
about my life,

23:26.939 --> 23:28.639
which he swore to me
he wouldn't?

23:28.641 --> 23:31.709
I have two options here,
and they both suck.

23:31.711 --> 23:35.513
Why don't you tell me
who I'm supposed to believe?

23:38.917 --> 23:41.018
So you didn't bring it?

23:41.020 --> 23:42.286
No.

23:42.288 --> 23:46.657
I've seen the tape,
and I can't show it to you.

23:46.659 --> 23:48.092
I don't want you
to protect me.

23:48.094 --> 23:50.361
Well, I'm going to whether
you want me to or not

23:50.363 --> 23:53.130
because you mean so much
to Taylor.

23:53.132 --> 23:56.634
And Carter, Grant.

23:56.636 --> 23:59.537
And me.

24:01.673 --> 24:02.873
When you asked
for my help,

24:02.875 --> 24:04.975
I gave it to you
very willingly.

24:04.977 --> 24:07.278
Yes, you did.

24:07.280 --> 24:09.847
Okay, so just give me
this one thing in return.

24:09.849 --> 24:11.482
That's all I'm
asking for.

24:11.484 --> 24:15.719
No... I can't.

24:15.721 --> 24:18.556
(sighs)

24:18.558 --> 24:23.127
You should probably
get out of here then.

24:30.435 --> 24:32.236
I'll be right back.

24:32.238 --> 24:34.939
You take your time.

24:41.246 --> 24:42.980
Is he always like this?

24:42.982 --> 24:44.014
Like what?

24:44.016 --> 24:45.916
Angry, mean.

24:45.918 --> 24:47.318
No.

24:47.320 --> 24:48.886
No, he's, he's mostly
depressed.

24:48.888 --> 24:53.991
I want to help him,
but... I don't know how.

24:53.993 --> 24:58.195
Sweetie, Max,
he needs doctors,
specialists.

24:58.197 --> 25:00.831
His body and his mind
are both suffering.

25:00.833 --> 25:01.932
Did you not hear
what he said?

25:01.934 --> 25:04.201
His parents can't
afford that stuff.

25:04.203 --> 25:05.669
Look, I'm all he has.

25:05.671 --> 25:09.306
Listen, that's too much
responsibility, okay?

25:09.308 --> 25:11.842
You have a life that
you need to get back to.

25:11.844 --> 25:14.311
Max <i>is</i> my life.
What about school?

25:14.313 --> 25:15.546
Do you think I care
about school?

25:15.548 --> 25:18.282
Yes, I do think
you care about school.

25:18.284 --> 25:20.150
You've worked so hard
for so long,

25:20.152 --> 25:22.152
you can't just
throw it away now.

25:22.154 --> 25:24.388
That's my decision,
not yours.

25:24.390 --> 25:27.024
And I'm gonna stay with Max
for as long as he needs me.

25:27.026 --> 25:28.826
Taylor, let's just
talk about this.

25:28.828 --> 25:31.161
We just did.

25:31.163 --> 25:32.963
(sighs heavily)

25:39.070 --> 25:40.137
Well, hey.

25:40.139 --> 25:42.506
Hey, um,
hope you don't mind,

25:42.508 --> 25:45.109
but I'm having one
of your frozen dinners.

25:45.111 --> 25:46.210
I am so sorry.
Let me--

25:46.212 --> 25:47.278
Let me make you something.

25:47.280 --> 25:50.014
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
This is fine, really.

25:50.016 --> 25:51.649
(timer beeping)

25:51.651 --> 25:56.353
You know, I was
gonna eat it...

25:56.355 --> 25:57.655
in my room.

25:57.657 --> 26:00.691
Okay, mmm,
you go for that.

26:00.693 --> 26:02.426
Do you want to split it?

26:02.428 --> 26:05.129
No, it's all yours.

26:05.131 --> 26:06.096
Are you sure?

26:06.098 --> 26:07.364
I mean,
it's your last one.

26:07.366 --> 26:09.366
Yes, Grant.
Bon appétit.

26:09.368 --> 26:11.802
I'm so sorry,
it's just--

26:11.804 --> 26:13.370
I just had
a horrible day.

26:13.372 --> 26:18.275
All I want for dinner is a big
bowl of chocolate ice cream.

26:20.445 --> 26:24.415
Yeah, I sorta
ate that, too.

26:26.017 --> 26:28.619
(phone ringing)

26:28.621 --> 26:32.022
(groaning)

26:34.125 --> 26:35.059
Hello?
Elizabeth?

26:35.061 --> 26:38.429
Hi, Claire Gregory from
the crisis response team.

26:38.431 --> 26:40.764
(Elizabeth)
<i>Yes, I'm so glad</i>
<i>that you called.</i>

26:40.766 --> 26:42.032
<i>How did it go today?</i>

26:42.034 --> 26:43.801
What did she say?

26:43.803 --> 26:44.668
Oh, I just got home.

26:44.670 --> 26:46.236
I didn't have a chance
to ask her.

26:46.238 --> 26:47.571
How 'bout we
get together

26:47.573 --> 26:51.141
and have a conversation
about what happened today?

26:51.143 --> 26:54.278
Of course,
but now you're scaring me.

26:54.280 --> 26:56.447
No need to he scared
at all.

26:56.449 --> 27:00.351
It's just better to have
these conversations in person.

27:00.353 --> 27:01.652
Do you have time
tomorrow?

27:01.654 --> 27:03.287
Yeah, absolutely.
For this?

27:03.289 --> 27:04.555
Late afternoon okay?

27:04.557 --> 27:07.257
3:00, town square,
by the fountain?

27:07.259 --> 27:08.359
Yeah, I know the place.

27:08.361 --> 27:12.997
<i>Well, thank you so much.</i>
<i>See you soon.</i>

27:12.999 --> 27:15.165
(phone beeps off)

27:24.843 --> 27:27.077
Hi.

27:27.079 --> 27:28.979
These are from my mom.

27:28.981 --> 27:32.316
She feels really bad about
the fight you had yesterday.

27:32.318 --> 27:33.951
Well, tell her thank you.

27:33.953 --> 27:36.253
Or you could call her.

27:36.255 --> 27:38.055
Or you could
tell her thank you,

27:38.057 --> 27:40.190
like I just asked you to.

27:41.726 --> 27:43.193
Okay.

27:45.363 --> 27:47.131
What is it?

27:47.133 --> 27:49.066
Nothing.

27:49.068 --> 27:51.602
You just rolled
your eyes.

27:51.604 --> 27:56.407
I'm tired of you
constantly saying "okay".

27:57.676 --> 28:00.010
Nothing's okay.

28:00.012 --> 28:04.281
Well... sure.

28:04.283 --> 28:06.583
I won't say it anymore.

28:08.787 --> 28:12.056
Ignore me, I'm in
a really bad mood.

28:12.058 --> 28:14.391
(knock on door)

28:14.393 --> 28:16.293
(woman)
Hi, is this a good time?

28:16.295 --> 28:17.428
Come in, Veronica.

28:17.430 --> 28:19.596
Max, this is Veronica.

28:19.598 --> 28:22.633
She works at the library
at the hospital.

28:22.635 --> 28:23.734
She brought some books.

28:23.736 --> 28:25.402
So I heard
you like Darwin.

28:25.404 --> 28:26.970
Could you give us
a minute?

28:26.972 --> 28:28.605
Of course.

28:28.607 --> 28:33.410
I prefer you not invite
random strangers in here.

28:34.045 --> 28:35.813
Sorry, he's not
in a great mood.

28:35.815 --> 28:37.047
I'm in a perfectly
fine mood.

28:37.049 --> 28:40.217
I just thought that
you would like a book.

28:40.219 --> 28:41.552
(door closes)

28:41.554 --> 28:43.620
What am I gonna do
with a book?

28:43.622 --> 28:47.624
Well, you could read it.

28:47.626 --> 28:49.526
You mean you'd
read it to me?

28:49.528 --> 28:50.227
What's wrong with that?

28:50.229 --> 28:53.497
I don't like you doing
all these things for me.

28:53.499 --> 28:54.898
I don't mind.

28:54.900 --> 28:55.532
I mind.

28:55.534 --> 28:59.803
Is it all right
if I mind?

28:59.805 --> 29:01.972
Yes, of course.

29:01.974 --> 29:05.609
Where are all your books?

29:06.244 --> 29:07.478
Why don't you have
any books, Taylor?

29:07.480 --> 29:09.613
I never see you doing
any homework.

29:09.615 --> 29:10.647
I don't have any.

29:10.649 --> 29:12.683
You don't have
any homework?

29:12.685 --> 29:14.284
No.

29:14.286 --> 29:16.820
I'm taking some time off.

29:16.822 --> 29:18.522
From what?

29:18.524 --> 29:19.556
From school.

29:19.558 --> 29:21.759
I'm taking a leave
of absence.

29:21.761 --> 29:22.860
It's not a big deal.

29:22.862 --> 29:24.294
Not because of me.

29:24.296 --> 29:28.499
Max, of course
it's because of you.

29:33.138 --> 29:35.172
I want you to go.

29:35.174 --> 29:36.707
You're ordering me
to go to school?

29:36.709 --> 29:38.876
No, I'm ordering you
to go away.

29:38.878 --> 29:40.644
I want you to leave.

29:42.847 --> 29:45.115
I'll leave,
but I'm gonna come back.

29:45.117 --> 29:48.719
Don't come back-- I want you
to get the hell out of here

29:48.721 --> 29:51.522
and stay gone.

29:53.625 --> 29:56.860
Okay.
Sorry.

30:05.837 --> 30:07.371
Still working
on those names?

30:07.373 --> 30:08.472
I have three females
that fall

30:08.474 --> 30:10.874
within the age range
that I'm looking for,

30:10.876 --> 30:13.377
but two of them I can't
find records for.

30:13.379 --> 30:14.978
But at least I've
narrowed down the search.

30:14.980 --> 30:17.314
I could help you with those
after school if you want.

30:17.316 --> 30:19.316
Okay.
That'll be fun.

30:19.318 --> 30:21.685
Oh, no, you know what?
I can't.

30:21.687 --> 30:25.022
I, um--
I have plans.

30:25.024 --> 30:26.356
You do?
With who?

30:26.358 --> 30:29.993
Well, I'm meeting
your therapist for coffee.

30:29.995 --> 30:32.629
You're meeting her?

30:32.631 --> 30:36.567
Yeah. She seems to have
concerns about you.

30:38.069 --> 30:39.803
Is that what she told you?

30:39.805 --> 30:41.939
Yeah.

30:41.941 --> 30:44.007
So you're meeting her?

30:44.009 --> 30:45.409
Yeah.

30:45.411 --> 30:47.578
Do you have a problem
with that?

30:50.348 --> 30:52.950
Yeah.

31:04.596 --> 31:07.564
Carter, are you sure
you want to be here?

31:09.701 --> 31:10.567
No.

31:10.569 --> 31:14.204
But... I can't wonder
what this was like

31:14.206 --> 31:15.372
for the rest of my life.

31:15.374 --> 31:18.075
You know what this means?

31:19.177 --> 31:21.211
Lori's going to prison,

31:21.213 --> 31:23.247
probably for 20 years.

31:23.249 --> 31:25.816
Yeah.

31:25.818 --> 31:27.484
She's my kidnapper.

31:27.486 --> 31:30.587
Yes, she is.

31:30.589 --> 31:34.491
And you're my mother.

31:38.363 --> 31:39.897
(sniffles)

31:39.899 --> 31:46.069
I'm never gonna...
get used to you saying that.

31:56.414 --> 32:00.050
Okay, um, so I'm gonna be
meeting Lori here,

32:00.052 --> 32:02.786
and you're gonna be
across the street
at that cafe.

32:02.788 --> 32:03.854
And I want you
to grab a seat.

32:03.856 --> 32:06.189
I don't want you
to be visible, understand?

32:06.191 --> 32:08.091
It's gonna be quick.

32:08.093 --> 32:10.294
This place is surrounded
by undercover cops.

32:10.296 --> 32:12.663
She has a history of
getting away when you say that.

32:12.665 --> 32:17.501
I'm gonna get Lori,
because this time,

32:17.503 --> 32:19.436
I have you on my side.

32:19.438 --> 32:21.972
And that means
everything to me.

32:25.576 --> 32:26.910
Will you text me
when she gets here?

32:26.912 --> 32:28.278
I will.
