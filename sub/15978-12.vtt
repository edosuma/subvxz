WEBVTT

00:03.804 --> 00:05.073
23!

00:05.106 --> 00:06.807
Oh, that's me!

00:06.840 --> 00:08.809
Hi, I'm Carol,

00:08.842 --> 00:10.578
and this is my son Nathan.

00:10.611 --> 00:12.580
He doesn't care.
We're having a
family dinner tonight,

00:12.613 --> 00:15.316
and we were told to bring
a fun, wintry dessert.
He just wants your order.

00:15.349 --> 00:17.518
But knowing Debbie,
she won't eat chocolate.
He doesn't.

00:17.551 --> 00:20.121
And knowing Tom,
he won't eat fruit,
Also a stranger.

00:20.154 --> 00:22.090
or else he'll spend the rest
of the night on the toilet.

00:22.123 --> 00:24.058
Okay, you know what? Just two
pounds of bread pudding, please.

00:25.126 --> 00:27.528
I saw that news report
you did yesterday

00:27.561 --> 00:29.530
on the squirrel
who can water-ski.

00:29.563 --> 00:31.465
Hard-hitting stuff.

00:31.499 --> 00:35.136
First of all, it was a chipmunk
and he was wakeboarding.

00:35.169 --> 00:37.605
I'll have you know
that he got up on the third try.

00:37.638 --> 00:39.207
All right?

00:39.240 --> 00:41.442
They're wasting you.

00:41.475 --> 00:43.844
You clearly have
the piercing eyes and strong jaw

00:43.877 --> 00:46.180
to deliver
the hard-hitting news.

00:46.214 --> 00:48.082
You look
like a young Paul Newman.

00:48.116 --> 00:50.484
Paul Newman used to make all
the girls weak in the knees

00:50.518 --> 00:52.753
when I was growing up.
Still does.

00:52.786 --> 00:54.755
I can't walk down
the salad dressing aisle

00:54.788 --> 00:57.625
without feeling a little
earthquake in the basement.

00:59.693 --> 01:01.129
Ma'am, your order's ready.

01:01.162 --> 01:03.231
Oh.
24!

01:07.535 --> 01:10.204
Excuse me, but you gave us

01:10.238 --> 01:12.206
an extra quarter pound
of the bread pudding.

01:12.240 --> 01:13.207
Okay, just a second.

01:13.241 --> 01:14.742
As soon as I'm finished helping
this customer.

01:14.775 --> 01:16.410
But you're not finished helping
this customer.

01:16.444 --> 01:18.746
Ma'am, it'll literally be
one minute.

01:18.779 --> 01:22.183
I'm sure Customer 24 won't mind
you finishing with Customer 23.
Yeah, Mom,

01:22.216 --> 01:24.185
we'll just take the extra.
It's fine.
(sighs)

01:24.218 --> 01:25.419
"It's fine"?

01:25.453 --> 01:27.821
"It's fine" is a lazy way
to live your life.

01:27.855 --> 01:31.159
"It's fine" is why we're chasing
the Chinese for world supremacy.

01:31.192 --> 01:33.161
"It's fine" is
why the young people

01:33.194 --> 01:34.628
don't know the art of cursive

01:34.662 --> 01:37.365
and I need to show I.D.
to buy allergy meds.

01:37.398 --> 01:38.299
"It's fine" is why...

01:38.332 --> 01:41.702
is why he insists
on helping Customer 24

01:41.735 --> 01:44.238
when Customer 23
is still waiting.

01:44.272 --> 01:45.706
Manager!
No manager!

01:45.739 --> 01:48.276
You are embarrassing me.
Can I help you?

01:48.309 --> 01:51.312
I don't know. Do you have
chloroform and a rag?

02:15.903 --> 02:17.205
Hey.

02:17.238 --> 02:19.540
There you are. Where's Mom?

02:19.573 --> 02:21.542
Oh, is she not complaining
right behind me?

02:21.575 --> 02:24.878
She must be still complaining
up the driveway.

02:24.912 --> 02:27.548
It's just ridiculous.

02:27.581 --> 02:29.617
Do you know how many
tattoo parlors I counted

02:29.650 --> 02:31.885
on the drive home? 14.

02:31.919 --> 02:35.289
When I was growing up,
two kinds of people had tattoos,

02:35.323 --> 02:37.358
soldiers and Popeye.

02:37.391 --> 02:40.861
Yesterday, I picked up
my prescription from a girl

02:40.894 --> 02:43.864
whose arm looked like the margin
of a sixth grader's notebook.

02:43.897 --> 02:45.399
I swear. I don't know...

02:45.433 --> 02:46.934
Shut up.

02:46.967 --> 02:48.336
Just shut up.

02:51.305 --> 02:52.806
Well, you
pulled the pin.

02:52.840 --> 02:55.443
You got ten seconds
to get out.

02:58.812 --> 03:01.382
Okay, ad-admittedly,
that came out slightly...

03:01.415 --> 03:03.784
sharper than I wanted it to.
But it's just...

03:03.817 --> 03:05.253
you got to find something
else in your life

03:05.286 --> 03:06.454
other than
criticizing everything.

03:06.487 --> 03:07.655
I-I can't take
all the complaining.

03:07.688 --> 03:10.624
After a long day at work,
I just... I need some me time.

03:10.658 --> 03:13.294
Okay, I get it.

03:13.327 --> 03:15.563
You're not talking 'cause I told
you to shut up. Would you...

03:15.596 --> 03:20.301
Look, why are you putting
your purse on deliberately?

03:20.334 --> 03:23.304
Hey, your silence scared me when
I was younger, but I'm 42 now!

03:23.337 --> 03:25.606
It's not like when I was 35!

03:28.442 --> 03:30.010
Grandpa,

03:30.043 --> 03:33.281
are you busy next
Friday night?
Pumpkin,

03:33.314 --> 03:36.684
the only thing I have on
my schedule is eventual death.

03:36.717 --> 03:40.588
Will that happen
between 7:00 and 9:00 on Friday?

03:40.621 --> 03:42.356
(chuckles)
I hope not.

03:42.390 --> 03:45.626
Good. Then will you take me
to the Daddy/Daughter Dance?

03:45.659 --> 03:46.927
Uh, yeah. I-I guess

03:46.960 --> 03:48.829
I could.

03:48.862 --> 03:50.398
Don't you want your father
to take you?

03:50.431 --> 03:53.467
He can't. He doesn't dance.

03:53.501 --> 03:55.769
What's she talking about?
Why don't you dance?

03:55.803 --> 03:58.506
I kind of had a bad
experience when I was a kid.

04:00.974 --> 04:02.443
I didn't know how to dance,

04:02.476 --> 04:04.312
so I just closed my eyes
and tried

04:04.345 --> 04:06.480
to copy everything
I'd ever seen on TV.

04:19.460 --> 04:21.462
(laughter)

04:22.596 --> 04:23.831
You know that expression, uh,

04:23.864 --> 04:25.366
"dance like no one is watching"?

04:25.399 --> 04:28.469
Turns out that is
terrible advice.

04:28.502 --> 04:30.037
I'm not taking Mikayla.

04:30.070 --> 04:32.406
Oh, come on, Dad.
She really wants to go.

04:32.440 --> 04:33.874
And she should. With her father.

04:33.907 --> 04:36.310
Trust me, you don't want
to skip this.

04:36.344 --> 04:39.046
I worked crazy hours when
Debbie was growing up. I always

04:39.079 --> 04:40.180
missed stuff like this.

04:40.213 --> 04:43.517
Carol had to take you
to your Daddy/Daughter Dance.

04:43.551 --> 04:44.718
I always
regretted

04:44.752 --> 04:47.054
not going to that dance
with Debbie.

04:47.087 --> 04:49.056
You can't go back
in time. When a...

04:49.089 --> 04:50.724
moment is gone, it's gone.

04:50.758 --> 04:53.794
It's like your hair
or your memory.

04:53.827 --> 04:55.629
When a moment's gone, it's gone.

04:55.663 --> 04:56.830
You can't go back in time.

04:56.864 --> 04:59.500
It's like your hair
or your memory.

04:59.533 --> 05:00.501
You're right, Tom.

05:00.534 --> 05:02.403
I'm gonna do this.

05:02.436 --> 05:04.338
I'm gonna dance.

05:06.940 --> 05:08.842
Excuse me, Tom,

05:08.876 --> 05:11.512
Debbie, Adam,

05:11.545 --> 05:15.416
lamp and no one else.

05:15.449 --> 05:17.451
I forgot my sweater.

05:23.691 --> 05:25.058
Your mom's not talking to you?

05:25.092 --> 05:26.827
No.

05:26.860 --> 05:28.629
Happened to me once.

05:28.662 --> 05:31.665
Once.

05:34.134 --> 05:36.103
How do I know
my mother's missing?

05:36.136 --> 05:39.006
Officer, Dr. Phil started
ten minutes ago

05:39.039 --> 05:42.109
and there's nobody here
talking back to the TV.

05:43.444 --> 05:45.446
(exhales)

05:45.479 --> 05:47.448
I drove up and down every street
in your neighborhood

05:47.481 --> 05:49.517
calling her name and shaking
a bag of Chex Mix.

05:49.550 --> 05:50.951
Nothing.

05:50.984 --> 05:53.954
(sighs)
Yeah. But... No, it
was just a normal day.

05:53.987 --> 05:56.724
E-Except that we did go to
the grocery store and I...

05:56.757 --> 05:58.726
I may have told her to shut up.

05:58.759 --> 06:02.630
I don't see why that matters,
but I'm 42 and a half.

06:03.864 --> 06:04.965
Yeah. Never mind.

06:04.998 --> 06:07.100
Hello, Ray. Nathan.

06:07.134 --> 06:08.502
Oh, you're talking to me now?
Do you mind telling me

06:08.536 --> 06:10.170
where you been?
I called you 20 times.

06:10.203 --> 06:11.905
God, I don't know why
I bought you that phone.

06:11.939 --> 06:14.141
You only use it for Sudoku
and recipes.

06:14.174 --> 06:16.877
I went back to the
grocery store to apologize

06:16.910 --> 06:19.480
to the bakery manager
since I made such a big,

06:19.513 --> 06:22.516
embarrassing scene.
You didn't need to do that.

06:22.550 --> 06:23.617
I know that now.

06:23.651 --> 06:26.587
Because he took my side
of the bread pudding fiasco,

06:26.620 --> 06:29.723
and then he gave me these
free muffins for my trouble.

06:29.757 --> 06:33.427
I argued with that manager
down at that store once.

06:33.461 --> 06:36.430
Know what I got for my trouble?
Tasered.

06:36.464 --> 06:38.599
After that,

06:38.632 --> 06:40.734
he and I chatted about ways
to improve the bakery,

06:40.768 --> 06:44.972
and now you're looking
at the new bakery clerk.

06:46.006 --> 06:48.041
You're kidding.

06:48.075 --> 06:50.511
Nope. Looks like I'll have
something to fill my days

06:50.544 --> 06:52.580
so you don't have to come home
to me complaining.

06:52.613 --> 06:53.681
And I hope
you don't get offended

06:53.714 --> 06:55.949
if I don't want to hear
you yakking when I get home.

06:55.983 --> 06:59.687
I might need some me time, too.

06:59.720 --> 07:02.756
Free muffins
and peace and quiet?

07:02.790 --> 07:05.659
Yeah, I think I can handle that.

07:07.695 --> 07:09.663
(groans)

07:09.697 --> 07:11.799
Don't even... don't
even say hello.

07:11.832 --> 07:13.233
I know that look.

07:13.266 --> 07:15.636
That is the look of a woman
who's had a long workday

07:15.669 --> 07:17.505
and is just looking forward
to enjoying a little me time,

07:17.538 --> 07:18.506
so feel free...

07:18.539 --> 07:20.140
People are idiots.

07:20.173 --> 07:22.576
To share the things
that irritated you today.

07:22.610 --> 07:25.646
All I wanted to do was brighten
customers' days

07:25.679 --> 07:26.647
with a little chitchat,

07:26.680 --> 07:29.783
but everyone was glued
to their smart phones.

07:29.817 --> 07:30.984
You're really gonna enjoy
this muffin.

07:31.018 --> 07:31.985
My son loves 'em.

07:32.019 --> 07:34.488
It's the
blueberries

07:34.522 --> 07:35.789
that get him.
When he was little,

07:35.823 --> 07:37.257
we used to pick them at my...

07:37.290 --> 07:39.960
at my uncle's farm in Richmond.

07:39.993 --> 07:42.963
But clearly you don't give
a rat's ass about that.

07:42.996 --> 07:44.565
Sample?

07:44.598 --> 07:46.834
Can anyone hear me?

07:46.867 --> 07:50.504
Sample? I'm an alien.

07:50.538 --> 07:52.673
Sample?

07:52.706 --> 07:54.842
Fresh out of my butt.

07:56.710 --> 07:58.278
Oh, hey, little guy.

07:58.311 --> 08:01.949
You're not too busy
for a cookie, are you?

08:01.982 --> 08:05.485
Just put it in my mouth.

08:14.728 --> 08:16.930
They no longer need to use
the brains in their heads 'cause

08:16.964 --> 08:18.198
they got one
in their pockets.

08:18.231 --> 08:20.200
People say there's an app...
...for everything.

08:20.233 --> 08:22.536
Well, tell me, where's the app
that can shake your hand?

08:22.570 --> 08:24.572
Or say "God bless you"
after you sneeze?

08:24.605 --> 08:25.939
I'd like to see
an app do that.

08:25.973 --> 08:27.240
(chuckles)
Call me

08:27.274 --> 08:29.309
Willie off the pickle boat,
but in my day,

08:29.342 --> 08:31.144
an app was something you shared
over fruity drinks

08:31.178 --> 08:33.781
before dinner
with your Bible study group!

08:33.814 --> 08:37.050
(laughs)
Say that last part again.

08:37.084 --> 08:38.318
...Bible study group.

08:38.351 --> 08:41.021
I say put down your not-so-smart
phones and look me in the eye

08:41.054 --> 08:43.757
because, if I want to stare
at the top of people's heads,

08:43.791 --> 08:46.159
I'll ride the glass elevator
at the mall.

08:46.193 --> 08:49.096
(chuckles) Don't get me started
on those things.

08:49.129 --> 08:54.101
This is Nathan Miller and that's
what's on Miller's mind.

08:59.673 --> 09:02.710
Okay. Let's see
what we got.
(music playing)

09:02.743 --> 09:04.044
So just jump right in?

09:04.077 --> 09:05.245
Okay.

09:07.214 --> 09:08.649
I always see a lot of pointing,

09:08.682 --> 09:09.650
which is why
I'm pointing right now.

09:09.683 --> 09:11.184
You know what I'm saying?

09:11.218 --> 09:12.753
Not sure why I just
karate-kicked

09:12.786 --> 09:14.722
'cause that could
totally hit a kid.

09:14.755 --> 09:16.256
Ooh.

09:16.289 --> 09:17.290
Ooh.

09:19.893 --> 09:21.729
What's this over here?
I got a devil horn on this hand

09:21.762 --> 09:24.632
and a... this guy over here's
holding a gun.

09:26.133 --> 09:27.868
Oh, yeah.

09:27.901 --> 09:30.570
Uh, this move I just stole
from the Lucky Charms guy.

09:31.772 --> 09:34.708
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
(music stops)

09:34.742 --> 09:36.910
I think we just need to pick
one dance move you're good at.

09:36.944 --> 09:38.245
'Cause what you did right there

09:38.278 --> 09:39.747
is why they ban dancing
in many countries.

09:41.248 --> 09:43.083
Sorry we're late.
There was a pet store

09:43.116 --> 09:45.719
next to the dress shop.
We got distracted.

09:45.753 --> 09:47.721
Grandpa climbed
in the puppy cage.

09:48.989 --> 09:51.859
There was no sign
that said we couldn't.

09:53.861 --> 09:55.763
Dad, you...

09:55.796 --> 09:57.297
Never mind.

09:57.330 --> 09:59.933
I'm gonna go try on my dress
for the dance.

09:59.967 --> 10:01.735
Okay, you do that, sweetie.

10:01.769 --> 10:03.804
We're gonna have
a great time!

10:03.837 --> 10:05.739
Hopefully that dress
is made out of Kevlar

10:05.773 --> 10:08.041
in case Daddy karate-kicks her
in the sternum.

10:08.075 --> 10:11.879
Trust me, all she's gonna
remember is that you were there.

10:11.912 --> 10:14.782
That's right.
You're a wise man, Dad.

10:14.815 --> 10:16.049
(barking)

10:16.083 --> 10:18.085
Oh, damn.

10:23.757 --> 10:26.259
I got to go back to the mall.

10:29.797 --> 10:31.699
The phones are lighting up.

10:31.732 --> 10:36.670
You've really captured the voice
of old, angry America, Miller.

10:36.704 --> 10:38.939
It's like somebody brought
Andy Rooney back to life

10:38.972 --> 10:40.974
and ironed his face.

10:41.008 --> 10:44.745
Old people are gonna be
eating him up like mashed peas.

10:44.778 --> 10:47.314
Let's try this
every day next week

10:47.347 --> 10:49.182
and see how it works out.

10:49.216 --> 10:51.018
Now, if you'll excuse me,

10:51.051 --> 10:55.122
all this talk about mashed peas
has made me hungry.

10:55.155 --> 10:56.790
(laughs)

10:56.824 --> 10:58.425
Do you hear that, Ray?
What?

10:58.458 --> 11:00.794
We're gonna be
indoor reporters.
(laughs)

11:00.828 --> 11:03.363
Who knew that my mother was
the golden goose of negativity?

11:03.396 --> 11:04.932
I just hope that goose
doesn't get constipated.

11:04.965 --> 11:06.399
We need five of these next week.

11:06.433 --> 11:08.068
Think your mom
still has it in her?

11:08.101 --> 11:10.838
I don't know. She gets pretty
stuck on one topic. She...

11:10.871 --> 11:12.740
I mean, you know,
she spent a whole month

11:12.773 --> 11:15.275
complaining about the hashtags
at the bottom of the TV screen

11:15.308 --> 11:17.811
during her favorite shows.

11:17.845 --> 11:21.314
Well, you know the kind of stuff
that gets her all riled up.

11:21.348 --> 11:23.216
Maybe you just need
to squeeze that goose

11:23.250 --> 11:24.384
until something pops out.

11:24.417 --> 11:26.119
Yeah.

11:34.127 --> 11:36.930
(phone ringing, sighs)

11:36.964 --> 11:38.231
Hello?

11:38.265 --> 11:39.332
(with accent):
Well, hi.

11:39.366 --> 11:41.802
We have to make an adjustment
to your cable line.

11:41.835 --> 11:44.872
We need someone home Friday
between 9:00 and 4:00, or 7:00.

11:44.905 --> 11:46.907
We're not really sure.

11:46.940 --> 11:48.942
What? You expect me

11:48.976 --> 11:50.277
to stand here...
Please hold.

11:51.311 --> 11:54.047
(instrumental music plays)

11:55.148 --> 11:56.984
Calling during the dinner hour.

11:57.017 --> 11:58.451
Keeping me on hold.

11:58.485 --> 12:00.788
And can you believe what
they're making me listen to?

12:00.821 --> 12:02.823
*

12:02.856 --> 12:04.792
That song dad used
to play all the time?

12:04.825 --> 12:06.359
What are the chances?

12:06.393 --> 12:08.128
(sighs)

12:08.161 --> 12:09.797
So how does all this
make you feel?

12:09.830 --> 12:11.799
I'll tell you how
it makes me feel.

12:11.832 --> 12:13.466
Companies today think
they can...

12:13.500 --> 12:14.935
...hold on to their customers

12:14.968 --> 12:16.804
no matter how long
they keep us on hold.

12:16.837 --> 12:19.372
If I wanted to waste an hour on
the phone listening to nonsense,

12:19.406 --> 12:20.874
I'd just call my Aunt Marjorie,

12:20.908 --> 12:22.742
who always puts her cat
on the phone.

12:29.382 --> 12:30.150
(scoffs)

12:30.183 --> 12:32.352
Where were you?
I'm late for work.

12:32.385 --> 12:34.554
Sorry. I-I got a flat tire
hitting potholes.

12:34.587 --> 12:36.323
I got coffee all over me.

12:36.356 --> 12:38.558
That's the shirt I gave you
for your birthday.

12:38.591 --> 12:40.393
What are you gonna do?

12:40.427 --> 12:42.896
I'll tell you what you do.
You call your elected...

12:42.930 --> 12:44.965
...officials and tell them
to stop arguing

12:44.998 --> 12:46.266
about who can legally marry who.

12:46.299 --> 12:47.968
I don't care about the holes

12:48.001 --> 12:49.236
people are filling
in their bedroom.

12:49.269 --> 12:50.470
I care about the holes

12:50.503 --> 12:53.040
that people aren't filling
in our streets.

12:53.073 --> 12:56.877
Hey, Mom, remember
my buddy Dan from high school?

12:56.910 --> 13:00.213
Look at this picture
he posted of his kid... Xander.

13:00.247 --> 13:02.515
Good God,
what kind of name is Xander?

13:02.549 --> 13:04.184
There was a time when names...

13:04.217 --> 13:05.185
...meant something.

13:05.218 --> 13:07.354
When I was a kid,
there were only ten names.

13:07.387 --> 13:08.956
Nine of them came
from the Bible.

13:08.989 --> 13:10.023
The only other one was Felix,

13:10.057 --> 13:11.892
and they just used that
for weirdos.

13:11.925 --> 13:13.360
Today it seems like
parents are picking names

13:13.393 --> 13:14.995
by pulling tiles
out of a Scrabble bag

13:15.028 --> 13:16.463
and trying to run up the score.

13:27.140 --> 13:30.010
(clattering)

13:43.623 --> 13:45.592
Mom?

13:45.625 --> 13:47.827
Your snow globes are here.

13:49.930 --> 13:51.464
Hey, Mr. Delivery Guy,

13:51.498 --> 13:54.134
don't break my globes,
and I won't bust your balls.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.468
(laughing)

13:55.502 --> 13:57.404
He said "balls."

13:57.437 --> 13:59.907
Ratings gold.

13:59.940 --> 14:01.942
Oh, can you believe this?

14:01.975 --> 14:03.076
They have me
on hold again,

14:03.110 --> 14:05.145
and they didn't even tell me
what company they're from.

14:05.178 --> 14:06.479
And can you hear that?

14:06.513 --> 14:08.982
Dad's favorite song again?

14:09.016 --> 14:10.984
I can't believe it!

14:11.018 --> 14:12.986
Wow! Gosh,
you are so worked up!

14:13.020 --> 14:15.155
Hey, would it help you
take your mind off of it

14:15.188 --> 14:16.656
if you gave me your opinion

14:16.689 --> 14:18.458
on celebrities
getting out of jail early?

14:18.491 --> 14:20.260
Good God,
don't get me started on that.

14:20.293 --> 14:22.062
I read one of those
just yesterday.

14:22.095 --> 14:24.031
Some stupid actress
hit a crossing guard.

14:24.064 --> 14:26.099
(insect buzzing)
Is that a fruit
fly in here?

14:26.133 --> 14:28.168
Do we have any insect spray?

14:28.201 --> 14:30.103
Yeah, well, listen--
that crossing guard--

14:30.137 --> 14:32.105
did he deserve it,
or was he just an innocent guy?

14:32.139 --> 14:33.340
He was a war hero.

14:33.373 --> 14:35.075
Of course he
was innocent.

14:35.108 --> 14:37.377
He survived three
tours in Afghanistan,

14:37.410 --> 14:39.612
but he couldn't survive
one no-talent tramp

14:39.646 --> 14:44.017
who was only famous for
getting pregnant at 16.

14:44.051 --> 14:45.318
Are there more flies in here?

14:45.352 --> 14:46.987
Where the hell are
they coming from?

14:47.020 --> 14:48.989
They're coming
from behind the microwave.

14:49.022 --> 14:50.991
Just breathe. Mom...
Oh, my God!

14:51.024 --> 14:53.961
Do you see what this is, Nathan?

14:53.994 --> 14:56.029
It's the extra quarter
pound of bread pudding

14:56.063 --> 14:57.130
that we brought home
from Debbie's house.

14:57.164 --> 14:58.531
I'm gonna get you
some water, okay?

14:58.565 --> 15:00.100
And of course we didn't
finish the bread pudding.

15:00.133 --> 15:02.002
There was a quarter-pound extra
we didn't want.

15:02.035 --> 15:04.571
And then I never had a chance
to throw it away

15:04.604 --> 15:07.107
because I was too busy
supergluing the snow globes...

15:07.140 --> 15:09.442
*

15:12.045 --> 15:13.280
(thudding)

15:15.315 --> 15:18.051
Mom?

15:18.085 --> 15:19.119
You're fine.

15:19.152 --> 15:20.988
Basically, you hyperventilated.

15:21.021 --> 15:23.223
These things are usually
triggered by anxiety.

15:23.256 --> 15:25.358
Did you have
a particularly stressful week?

15:25.392 --> 15:27.460
Unbelievably
stressful.

15:27.494 --> 15:29.029
It's like every
little aggravation

15:29.062 --> 15:30.597
that could happen
to me did.

15:30.630 --> 15:32.532
It was weird, wasn't it, Nathan?

15:32.565 --> 15:34.534
I didn't notice.

15:34.567 --> 15:36.503
Okay, well,
we're gonna monitor your vitals

15:36.536 --> 15:37.704
for another five minutes.

15:37.737 --> 15:38.838
Then you're free to go.

15:38.871 --> 15:41.141
Uh, Jennifer here will
get started on your paperwork.

15:41.174 --> 15:42.442
Thank you.
Oh, you know what?

15:42.475 --> 15:44.711
I... I can do that for her.
Least I can do.

15:44.744 --> 15:46.179
Oh, my God.

15:46.213 --> 15:48.015
Oh... my... God.

15:48.048 --> 15:49.249
You're Miller's Mind.

15:49.282 --> 15:50.583
I'm a huge fan.

15:50.617 --> 15:52.185
I love that one
where you...

15:52.219 --> 15:54.054
Well, yeah, they're all good.
Thank you so much.

15:54.087 --> 15:55.322
What's she talking about?

15:55.355 --> 15:58.225
Oh, that piece on kid
names was dead right.

15:58.258 --> 16:01.394
My sister wanted to name
her girl Tazia with a "Z."

16:01.428 --> 16:04.397
It's like you said-- just
pulling Scrabble tiles.

16:04.431 --> 16:06.033
That's... that's what I said.

16:06.066 --> 16:07.500
Okay, you know what?
You've been very helpful.

16:07.534 --> 16:08.668
Thank you.
(clears his throat)

16:08.701 --> 16:09.402
How did she...?

16:09.436 --> 16:10.570
Look...

16:10.603 --> 16:12.172
I've been taking some
of the rants

16:12.205 --> 16:13.306
that you've said recently
and using them

16:13.340 --> 16:15.208
in a new piece
I'm doing on the air.

16:15.242 --> 16:17.177
Why wouldn't you just tell me?

16:17.210 --> 16:20.080
Well, uh, because,
in order to keep you doing them,

16:20.113 --> 16:23.316
I'm also the one that's been
irritating you on purpose.

16:23.350 --> 16:25.085
I'm sorry.

16:25.118 --> 16:28.255
You've been doing this
to me on purpose?
(mechanical beeping)

16:28.288 --> 16:30.490
(rapid beeping)
Like some bear for you to poke?

16:30.523 --> 16:32.192
(very rapid beeping)
Oh, God, no, no, no, no.

16:32.225 --> 16:35.162
We've been using more of it like
a Golden Goose metaphor. Look...

16:35.195 --> 16:37.164
(beeping slows)

16:37.197 --> 16:39.399
I-I-I just didn't know
that it would get this far.

16:39.432 --> 16:41.401
I was so sick of doing
the fluff pieces,

16:41.434 --> 16:43.770
and for once, people actually
cared about what I was saying.

16:43.803 --> 16:45.538
I mean, it felt good
making a difference

16:45.572 --> 16:46.706
in their lives. I'm sorry.

16:46.739 --> 16:49.176
I know it doesn't
make any sense.

16:50.477 --> 16:53.146
Actually, it makes
perfect sense.

16:53.180 --> 16:54.314
You're like me.

16:54.347 --> 16:56.449
Why do you think I
complain all the time?

16:56.483 --> 16:57.717
To hear myself talk?

16:57.750 --> 17:01.454
No. I'm hoping someone will hear
me, and I can make a difference.

17:01.488 --> 17:03.490
You know what? You have.

17:03.523 --> 17:05.092
After our rant
on potholes,

17:05.125 --> 17:07.260
the city set up a hotline
to report them.

17:07.294 --> 17:10.163
They call it
"The Pot Line."

17:10.197 --> 17:12.265
It's actually created
a whole new set of problems.

17:12.299 --> 17:15.168
But, you know, still,
just baby steps.

17:15.202 --> 17:16.303
Well, I'm-I'm thrilled

17:16.336 --> 17:19.106
that my opinions are getting
the audience they deserve,

17:19.139 --> 17:21.574
but I can't keep getting
riled up every day

17:21.608 --> 17:23.843
to the point of wanting
to choke someone.

17:23.876 --> 17:27.214
If I wanted that, I would have
stayed married to your dad.

17:27.247 --> 17:30.317
You're gonna have to start
doing these rants on your own.

17:30.350 --> 17:31.651
I don't know if I can.

17:31.684 --> 17:33.553
I mean, you've got
that raw, organic anger

17:33.586 --> 17:35.855
just bubbling up inside you,
like a good reporter should.

17:35.888 --> 17:37.124
I don't have that.

17:37.157 --> 17:40.293
Maybe that's why I keep getting
stuck doing the stupid stories,

17:40.327 --> 17:42.395
like potatoes
that resemble their owners.

17:44.364 --> 17:47.734
Oh, please. You were the
fussiest baby I ever met,

17:47.767 --> 17:50.703
and I have half a
nipple to prove it.

17:50.737 --> 17:53.140
But when your mother's the
biggest complainer on earth,

17:53.173 --> 17:55.875
maybe it doesn't give you a
chance to do it yourself.

17:55.908 --> 17:59.179
Trust me, you've got a little
Angry Carol inside you,

17:59.212 --> 18:01.214
and she's got
something to say.

18:01.248 --> 18:02.749
You just got
to let her out.

18:02.782 --> 18:04.784
Mr. Miller, I
forgot that the lab

18:04.817 --> 18:06.519
requires a separate
set of forms,

18:06.553 --> 18:08.588
as does the
cardiologist on call.

18:08.621 --> 18:10.290
And this is
for insurance.

18:10.323 --> 18:12.259
Now, when you're done
with those, come find me,

18:12.292 --> 18:14.261
and I'll have you fill
out the discharge papers.

18:14.294 --> 18:15.695
Oh, uh... uh, thank you.

18:15.728 --> 18:17.096
Yeah.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.632
Thank you?

18:19.666 --> 18:21.901
Is that how you feel
about filling out those forms?

18:21.934 --> 18:23.303
You feel thankful?

18:23.336 --> 18:24.504
Uh, no, I don't.

18:24.537 --> 18:26.539
I actually feel
pretty irritated.

18:28.941 --> 18:31.311
(whispering):
Let her out, son.

18:31.344 --> 18:35.148
Let your little Angry Carol
come out and play.

18:35.182 --> 18:38.185
There are just...
there are so many of them.

18:38.218 --> 18:40.320
There sure are.

18:40.353 --> 18:42.689
And they all start
with the same five questions.

18:42.722 --> 18:45.158
That sounds irritating.

18:45.192 --> 18:48.628
It is. And how many times do
I have to write my address down?

18:48.661 --> 18:50.597
It's like you go
to the hospital...

18:50.630 --> 18:52.299
...with a simple case
of hyperventilation,

18:52.332 --> 18:54.701
and you come home
with carpal tunnel so bad,

18:54.734 --> 18:56.503
you can't even
give 'em the finger!

18:56.536 --> 18:59.906
The health care industry needs
to get it down to one form.

18:59.939 --> 19:03.710
I'm sick of my doctors
making it rain!

19:03.743 --> 19:05.845
This is Nathan Miller...

19:05.878 --> 19:07.847
not signing off.

19:07.880 --> 19:09.349
(theme music plays)

19:09.382 --> 19:11.251
And that's what's
on Miller's mind.

19:17.824 --> 19:19.859
(upbeat
instrumental music plays)

19:19.892 --> 19:21.894
(sighs)

19:23.630 --> 19:25.432
I'm glad you came, Daddy.

19:25.465 --> 19:26.833
Hey, I wouldn't want
to be anywhere else

19:26.866 --> 19:28.268
in the world but right here.

19:31.304 --> 19:35.308
So... are we gonna stand here
or dance?

19:37.344 --> 19:39.346
(sighs)
Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
we can do that.

19:39.379 --> 19:41.914
(sighs)

19:41.948 --> 19:45.285
Don't panic. Just pick one style
of dance and stick to it.

19:46.619 --> 19:48.755
All right.

19:59.399 --> 20:01.268
Okay, honey, honey, honey,
honey, you-you got to stop.

20:01.301 --> 20:02.502
You got to stop dancing
like that.

20:02.535 --> 20:05.638
Why? This is how I dance.
It's fun.

20:05.672 --> 20:06.939
Well, of course it is,
I know, but

20:06.973 --> 20:09.309
you got to trust me, okay?
If you don't stop,

20:09.342 --> 20:11.478
people are gonna laugh
and call you names.

20:11.511 --> 20:13.012
No, they're not.

20:13.045 --> 20:15.515
We're not allowed to make fun
of people for being different.

20:15.548 --> 20:17.950
They teach us that.

20:17.984 --> 20:20.387
Well, what if you're super tall?

20:20.420 --> 20:24.357
Can the other kids call you
"The Leaning Tower of Idiot?"

20:24.391 --> 20:27.794
Nope. It's kind of awesome.

20:29.396 --> 20:30.897
Yes, it is.

20:30.930 --> 20:32.999
That is kind of awesome.

20:33.032 --> 20:34.401
