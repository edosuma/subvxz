Did you not think

00:07.635 --> 00:09.260
the baby lizards

00:06.006 --> 00:09.260
behaved beautifully?

00:09.385 --> 00:10.866
If by "beautifully"

00:10.867 --> 00:12.346
you mean chasing a soccer mom

00:12.471 --> 00:14.014

- Mrs. Chesterfield.

00:31.532 --> 00:32.595
The lizards have been

00:32.597 --> 00:33.659
a bit of a handful.

00:33.785 --> 00:35.411
- And you
- meant the kids.

00:37.496 --> 00:39.540
Precisely.

00:39.665 --> 00:41.560
- Although if you're - having trouble with
- Those other animals,

00:41.584 --> 00:43.024
I'd be more than happy

00:43.025 --> 00:44.462

- But cooping up - young lizards

Will only make

02:54.384 --> 02:55.384
them miserable.

- If you love them, - don't you want what's

you are both

- Ravi.
- They're eight.

- I am still going - to need to see
- Some tax records.

- Next!

03:43.766 --> 03:45.434
Absolutely not.

- your interest,

03:48.228 --> 03:49.334
But it is clear that

03:49.335 --> 03:50.439
neither of you

03:50.564 --> 03:51.775
is properly equipped

03:51.776 --> 03:52.984
to parent a baby lizard.

03:56.445 --> 03:57.989
I know. Next!

04:02.785 --> 04:04.387
- Ravi, I get that you
- have high standards,

04:04.411 --> 04:05.579
But your lizards

04:05.580 --> 04:06.747
need a new home,

04:06.872 --> 04:08.683
- and you're - rejecting people
- As fast as...

04:11.503 --> 04:12.753

- Separate my babies!

And no one

04:21.534 --> 04:23.347
wants to adopt

all 12 lizards.

The only person who loves

04:44.452 --> 04:45.619
lizards more than I do

04:43.283 --> 04:45.619
is my boss,

04:45.744 --> 04:46.745
and she wants

04:46.746 --> 04:47.746
to adopt all 12.

04:47.872 --> 04:49.708
So just sign here,

04:49.709 --> 04:51.542
and she'll send them

04:51.667 --> 04:53.586
to a lovely place upstate

04:53.587 --> 04:55.504
with lots of room

04:51.667 --> 04:55.504
and lizard playmates.

That sounds perfect,

04:56.653 --> 04:57.673
right, Ravi?

04:57.798 --> 05:00.551
all the lizards,

05:00.676 --> 05:03.721
and she's here...

05:03.846 --> 05:05.056
The only small condition

05:05.057 --> 05:06.265
is that I would need to

05:03.846 --> 05:06.265
take them now.

05:06.390 --> 05:07.951
- My boss is anxious
- to get her hands on them.

- proper claw care?

05:13.981 --> 05:15.524
- Will there be
- a nightlight?

05:15.649 --> 05:16.751

- a sleep-crawler.

Well, later I found out that

08:06.113 --> 08:07.571
"farm upstate" was actually

16:25.276 --> 16:26.653
I'm not sure.

16:26.778 --> 16:27.779
Maybe give me

16:27.780 --> 16:28.780
something to

16:26.778 --> 16:28.780
bite down on.

16:31.408 --> 16:33.201
I love it.

16:34.202 --> 16:35.328
It's so me.

16:36.872 --> 16:40.333
And so not you!

16:40.458 --> 16:41.919
Don't be so sure.

16:41.920 --> 16:43.378
I wore this when I was

16:40.458 --> 16:43.378
a Spring Chicken.

16:43.503 --> 16:44.212
- You mean before
- you were old?

16:44.337 --> 16:47.215
Watch it.

16:47.340 --> 16:49.235
- "Spring Chickens" - is what they called
- Us poultry models.

16:49.259 --> 16:50.656
My nickname

16:50.657 --> 16:52.053
was Rhoda Island Red.

16:54.932 --> 16:56.224
Well, it's beautiful.

16:56.349 --> 16:57.768
It's yours.

16:57.893 --> 16:59.286
- You're giving - it to me?
- Mmm-hmm.

16:59.310 --> 17:00.854
- Why?
- Oh!

17:00.979 --> 17:02.856
- Don't read
- anything into it.

17:02.981 --> 17:04.900
- Let's just say - you remind me
- Of someone.

17:05.023 --> 17:06.422
Is her name

17:06.423 --> 17:07.819
Rhoda Chesterfield?

17:07.944 --> 17:09.154
No, Evelyn Norman.

17:09.155 --> 17:10.363
We met at summer camp.

17:10.488 --> 17:12.449
- Now she works at
- a gas station in Jersey.

17:14.492 --> 17:16.912
Oh. Well, thank you.

17:19.079 --> 17:20.749
- You know,
- Mrs. Chesterfield,

17:20.874 --> 17:21.207
- I think you're
- actually a nice person.

17:21.332 --> 17:23.292
Well, duh!

17:25.002 --> 17:26.714
In fact, just recently,

17:26.714 --> 17:28.423
I endowed

17:25.002 --> 17:28.423
a lizard sanctuary.

17:28.548 --> 17:30.884
(CHOKING)

17:31.009 --> 17:32.779
- That's where I - had my assistant
- Take Ravi's lizards

17:32.803 --> 17:34.178
After I adopted them.

17:34.304 --> 17:35.973
A lizard sanctuary?

17:36.097 --> 17:37.120
As in a place that

17:37.121 --> 17:38.141
saves lizards?

17:38.266 --> 17:39.476
Yes. I... I apologize

17:39.477 --> 17:40.685
for the secrecy,

17:40.811 --> 17:42.104
but I knew

17:42.105 --> 17:43.396
he would never give

17:40.811 --> 17:43.396
them to me directly.

17:43.521 --> 17:44.832
- He probably would have - thought I'd
turn them - Into boots or something.

17:44.856 --> 17:46.942
(MANIACAL LAUGHTER)

17:48.067 --> 17:49.152
(NERVOUS CHUCKLE)

17:52.113 --> 17:53.907
- What's the matter?
- You're sweating.

17:54.032 --> 17:55.575
- There's no sweating
- in vintage.

17:57.995 --> 17:58.996
Here you go, little dude.

18:00.371 --> 18:01.372
I hope this bag

18:01.373 --> 18:02.373
wasn't related to you.

18:03.082 --> 18:04.082
Oh, well.

18:05.961 --> 18:06.961
Go!

18:09.297 --> 18:10.799
We must hurry!

18:10.924 --> 18:12.071
I'm trying,

18:12.072 --> 18:13.217
but I'm covered in bites.

18:13.343 --> 18:14.886
Those are love bites.

18:15.012 --> 18:16.892
- And how are those
- different from hate bites?

18:17.014 --> 18:18.932
- I will have to get
- back to you on that.

18:20.558 --> 18:21.790
Okay, I think

18:21.791 --> 18:23.020
that was the last lizard.

18:23.144 --> 18:25.384
- Great! Let's make - like a bread truck
- And haul buns!

18:27.565 --> 18:30.276
Wait! Where is Scooter?

18:30.401 --> 18:31.945
He was in my pocket,

18:31.946 --> 18:33.488
but he must have

18:30.401 --> 18:33.488
jumped out!

18:35.406 --> 18:37.075
Look, there he is!

18:37.200 --> 18:38.200
ZURI: Go get him!

18:40.411 --> 18:42.246
Welcome, everyone,

18:42.372 --> 18:43.853
to the dedication

18:43.854 --> 18:45.333
of the Chesterfield

18:42.372 --> 18:45.333
Lizard Sanctuary.

18:45.458 --> 18:49.128
Yes! Yes.

18:49.253 --> 18:50.881
Oh! Well, it was either

18:50.882 --> 18:52.507
this or give my money

18:49.253 --> 18:52.507
to cankle research,

18:52.632 --> 18:54.443
- and I do believe - I've made
- The right choice.

18:54.467 --> 18:56.011
(LAUGHING)

18:56.135 --> 18:58.429
Debatable.

18:58.555 --> 18:59.723
I can't wait

18:59.724 --> 19:00.891
for you all to see

19:01.016 --> 19:02.827
- these majestic creatures
- in their new home.

19:02.851 --> 19:05.896
So without further ado,

19:08.899 --> 19:09.899
(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING)

19:10.984 --> 19:12.111
I give you

19:12.112 --> 19:13.236
lizard paradise!

19:17.407 --> 19:18.407
(ALL GASPING)

19:20.326 --> 19:22.537
Hey, look, we're on TV!

19:26.374 --> 19:27.894
- Rhoda Chesterfield
- is murdering lizards!

19:27.918 --> 19:29.961
(ALL GASPING)

19:30.087 --> 19:31.313
- They should throw
- the book at her!

19:31.337 --> 19:32.589
A big, heavy book

19:32.590 --> 19:33.840
that would really hurt!

19:33.965 --> 19:36.175
I recommend Moby Dick!

19:39.054 --> 19:40.415
- Emma, what are you
- pointing at?

19:46.310 --> 19:47.310
Uh...

19:52.233 --> 19:54.819
This is a lizard sanctuary.

19:54.945 --> 19:56.237
And ouch!

19:58.322 --> 19:59.908
Sorry.

20:00.033 --> 20:01.368
On the bright side,

20:01.369 --> 20:02.702
you can cancel that

20:00.033 --> 20:02.702
mustache waxing.

20:05.663 --> 20:06.853
I've spoken to the media

20:06.854 --> 20:08.041
and managed to

20:05.663 --> 20:08.041
set the record straight.

20:08.166 --> 20:09.585
Are you eating

20:09.586 --> 20:11.002
the hors d'oeuvres?

20:11.128 --> 20:13.588
(MUFFLED) No.

20:13.713 --> 20:15.090
Why would you think

20:15.091 --> 20:16.466
I would do something

20:13.713 --> 20:16.466
so horrible

20:16.591 --> 20:17.651
- as to hurt
- baby lizards?

20:17.675 --> 20:20.887
Gee, I don't know.

20:21.012 --> 20:22.139
Have you met you?

20:22.973 --> 20:25.183
Look, we're sorry.

20:25.308 --> 20:26.580
But in our defense,

20:26.581 --> 20:27.852
things did look

20:25.308 --> 20:27.852
pretty suspicious.

20:27.978 --> 20:29.584
Like the fact that

20:29.585 --> 20:31.189
you are wearing

20:27.978 --> 20:31.189
lizard-skin shoes,

20:31.314 --> 20:32.419
and all of that

20:32.420 --> 20:33.524
lizard-skin swag!

20:33.650 --> 20:35.401
Fake.

20:35.526 --> 20:36.527
As fake as my feelings

20:36.528 --> 20:37.528
for my first husband.

20:40.031 --> 20:41.554
But you said those lizards

20:41.555 --> 20:43.076
were going to

20:40.031 --> 20:43.076
make you look good.

20:43.201 --> 20:45.642
Yes, well...

20:45.643 --> 20:48.081
I was hoping this

20:43.201 --> 20:48.081
lizard sanctuary

20:48.206 --> 20:49.437
would help change

20:49.438 --> 20:50.667
my image.

20:50.792 --> 20:53.045
It might surprise you

20:53.046 --> 20:55.296
to know that in some circles,

20:50.792 --> 20:55.296
people seem to think I'm a...

20:55.421 --> 20:56.421
- Nightmare?
- Horror?

20:56.506 --> 20:57.506
Evil shrew?

21:00.218 --> 21:01.366
Look, everyone,

21:01.367 --> 21:02.512
Mrs. Chesterfield

21:00.218 --> 21:02.512
isn't that bad.

21:02.637 --> 21:03.993
When I was forced to

21:03.994 --> 21:05.348
spend an afternoon

21:02.637 --> 21:05.348
with her,

21:05.473 --> 21:07.454
I actually hated it

21:07.455 --> 21:09.435
a lot less than I thought.

21:09.560 --> 21:11.021
That is the nicest

21:11.022 --> 21:12.480
thing anyone's ever

21:09.560 --> 21:12.480
said to me, Jemma.

21:15.566 --> 21:17.402
Mrs. Chesterfield,

21:17.403 --> 21:19.237
I am sorry

21:15.566 --> 21:19.237
I misjudged you.

21:19.362 --> 21:20.697
You have earned a lot of

21:20.698 --> 21:22.032
good karma today,

21:22.157 --> 21:23.387
so just know

21:23.388 --> 21:24.617
something equally nice

21:22.157 --> 21:24.617
will soon happen to you.

21:24.742 --> 21:28.621
Oh, it already has.

21:28.746 --> 21:30.915
You mean putting an end

21:30.916 --> 21:33.084
to our feud and forging

21:28.746 --> 21:33.084
six new friendships?

21:33.210 --> 21:34.711
- (LAUGHS)
- No, of course not.

21:36.796 --> 21:39.008
I mean finally getting

21:39.009 --> 21:41.218
12 annoying lizards

21:36.796 --> 21:41.218
out of my building.

21:41.342 --> 21:42.342
Point, Rhoda!

21:46.347 --> 21:47.453
She's awful!

21:47.454 --> 21:48.558
How can you

21:46.347 --> 21:48.558
stand her?

21:48.683 --> 21:49.883
- She's my mom.
- (ALL GASPING)

21:51.811 --> 21:54.564
Oh, you poor thing.

21:54.689 --> 21:56.358
Well, at least

21:56.359 --> 21:58.026
someday you'll inherit

21:54.689 --> 21:58.026
a lot of money.

21:58.151 --> 21:59.445
Not if Zeus has

21:59.446 --> 22:00.737
anything to say

21:58.151 --> 22:00.737
about it.

22:00.862 --> 22:02.823
- Why does a dog - need a house
- In the Hamptons?

22:04.615 --> 22:06.180
You know, being your prisoner

22:06.181 --> 22:07.744
was the highlight of my year.

22:08.411 --> 22:10.580
Aww.

22:10.705 --> 22:11.497
- Could you be sure
- to mention that

22:10.705 --> 22:11.705
To the authorities?

22:15.793 --> 22:17.521
- You know, - I can't believe
- I'm saying this,

22:17.545 --> 22:19.505
- But I kind of miss
- the baby lizards.

22:19.630 --> 22:21.570
Spoken like someone

22:21.571 --> 22:23.509
who's never been

22:19.630 --> 22:23.509
their chew toy.

22:23.634 --> 22:24.845
Well, I'm not going to

22:24.846 --> 22:26.054
miss the teeth marks

22:23.634 --> 22:26.054
on my shoes.

22:26.179 --> 22:27.368
Or the lizard surprises

22:27.369 --> 22:28.556
in my shoes.

22:28.681 --> 22:30.559
Or the times

22:30.560 --> 22:32.435
I caught Scooter

22:28.681 --> 22:32.435
wearing my shoes.

22:32.560 --> 22:34.270
That little guy

22:34.271 --> 22:35.980
had weird hobbies.

22:36.106 --> 22:37.666
- Well, anyway, - thank goodness
- We're back to being

22:37.690 --> 22:39.131
- Just a normal,
- one-lizard family.

22:44.281 --> 22:45.469
Jessie!

22:45.470 --> 22:46.657
Mrs. Kipling's babies

22:44.281 --> 22:46.657
missed their mommy,

22:46.783 --> 22:48.681
and they brought

22:48.682 --> 22:50.578
their new friends over

22:46.783 --> 22:50.578
for a playdate.

22:50.703 --> 22:51.934
Can they sleep over?

22:51.935 --> 22:53.164
Please?

22:53.290 --> 22:54.999
Sure.

22:55.125 --> 22:56.518
- Bertram! We're gonna
- need more crickets!

22:56.542 --> 22:57.836
And a hundred

22:57.837 --> 22:59.129
tiny sleeping bags!
