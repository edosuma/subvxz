WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 12:27.644
I It seems today
that all you see Jâ€œ

00:04.880 --> 12:30.522
I Is violence in movies
and sex on TV I

00:08.133 --> 12:33.775
I But where are those good
old-fashioned values I

00:11.512 --> 12:37.154
I On which we used to rely?

00:14.389 --> 12:40.031
I Lucky there's a family guy

00:17.684 --> 12:43.326
I Lucky there's a man who
positively can do I

00:21.438 --> 12:47.080
I All the things that make us

00:23.190 --> 12:48.832
I Laugh and cry

00:24.816 --> 12:50.458
I He's... a...
fam... ily... guy! I

00:35.827 --> 13:01.469
Wow, I'm so excited
for Brian.

00:37.955 --> 13:03.597
Remember, kids--
if it's terrible,

00:39.581 --> 13:05.223
at the end, we all say,
"You did it!"

00:42.209 --> 13:07.851
I can't believe we're
going to the theater

00:43.669 --> 13:09.311
the same day Chris
drowned a mouse in a puddle.

00:46.213 --> 13:11.855
I mean, don't we need a day
to clear our heads?

00:48.549 --> 13:14.191
Boy, this takes me back.

00:49.883 --> 13:15.525
You know, I was, uh...

00:51.051 --> 13:16.693
kind of one of those theater
kids in high school.

00:52.928 --> 13:18.570
I Suddenly Seymour...

00:55.556 --> 13:21.198
I Suddenly Seymour...

00:57.558 --> 13:23.200
I He purified me

00:59.560 --> 13:25.202
I He purified you

01:02.062 --> 13:27.704
I Suddenly Seymour...

01:07.025 --> 13:32.667
Mrs. Andrews, | pooped
in the pot again.

01:09.820 --> 13:35.462
I'm gonna need somebody
to clean me up.

01:12.197 --> 13:37.839
(crying)

01:13.198 --> 13:38.840
It's really bad this time.

01:15.576 --> 13:41.218
Wow, what a turnout.

01:17.202 --> 13:42.844
Oh, hey, there's Glenn.

01:18.287 --> 13:43.929
Hey, guys.

01:19.329 --> 13:44.971
Hey, this is my date,
Consuela.

01:20.789 --> 13:46.431
No, no, no.

01:22.833 --> 13:48.475
Okay, we're here
as friends,

01:24.293 --> 13:49.935
but I'm gonna change
your mind one day.

01:26.545 --> 13:52.187
(indistinct conversations)

01:29.798 --> 13:55.440
Oh, I'm so proud of Brian.

01:31.341 --> 13:56.983
It's hard to believe
he's the same dog

01:33.302 --> 13:58.944
who barked at a pineapple
for four hours.

01:35.470 --> 14:01.112
Close your purse.
I can see your tampons.

01:37.723 --> 14:03.365
And why do you need six?

01:39.099 --> 14:04.741
What happens to you?

01:41.101 --> 14:06.743
There's the man
of the hour.

01:42.603 --> 14:08.245
Hey, Brian, can you believe

01:43.812 --> 14:09.454
I found this blazer
on the side of the highway?

01:45.814 --> 14:11.456
Hey, guys.
Thanks for coming.

01:47.232 --> 14:12.874
Big night, Brian.
How you feeling?

01:49.610 --> 14:15.252
Well, a little nervous.

01:50.569 --> 14:16.211
| just want it to go well.

01:51.820 --> 14:17.462
Fingers crossed.

01:52.779 --> 14:18.421
Will there be
an intermission?

01:54.239 --> 14:19.881
Because that will determine
whether or not

01:55.782 --> 14:21.424
I bring this empty Gatorade
bottle into the theater.

01:58.285 --> 14:23.927
TOM: This is
unacceptable!

01:59.536 --> 14:25.178
Sorry, guys,
I got to go.

02:01.288 --> 14:26.930
They didn't put masking tape
over a seat for Tom Tucker

02:03.498 --> 14:29.140
and he's in there
pitching a fit.

02:05.292 --> 14:30.934
TOM: Do you
know who I am?!

02:06.293 --> 14:31.935
I'm Tom Tucker,
damn it!

02:07.544 --> 14:33.186
| make more in an hour
than you make in two hours!

02:10.797 --> 14:36.439
Oh, the play's about to start.

02:14.259 --> 14:39.901
Mom, am I going to fit
in the seat

02:15.927 --> 14:41.569
or is this going to be
like last time?

02:19.139 --> 14:44.781
This should tide you
over for a while.

02:21.141 --> 14:46.783
I'll come back
as soon as I can.

02:25.312 --> 14:50.954
She's not coming
back, you know.

02:27.189 --> 14:52.831
How do you know that?

02:28.440 --> 14:54.082
'Cause she's
my mom, too.

02:32.944 --> 14:58.586
Excuse me, that's my seat.

02:37.324 --> 15:02.966
We'll talk
about this at home.

02:40.327 --> 15:05.969
(sighs):
Let's see.

02:41.453 --> 15:07.095
Who's in this thing?

02:42.454 --> 15:08.096
Sad. Nobody.

02:43.538 --> 15:09.180
Sad. Sad. Nobody.

02:45.290 --> 15:10.932
Victor Garber?

02:47.542 --> 15:13.184
How did he get Victor...?

02:48.960 --> 15:14.602
Oh, of course.

02:50.170 --> 15:15.812
Tonight it's Randall Evan
Batti ncou rt.

02:52.089 --> 15:17.731
God, I hate understudies.

02:53.340 --> 15:18.982
King Louis the Sixteenth

02:54.716 --> 15:20.358
has been sentenced to death
by guillotine.

02:57.344 --> 15:22.986
(cheering)

02:59.054 --> 15:24.696
The part of King Louis
the Sixteenth

03:00.597 --> 15:26.239
will be played
by Jean de Menard.

03:03.225 --> 15:28.867
(crowd groans)

03:04.851 --> 15:30.493
Relax, you're
going to do great.

03:06.478 --> 15:32.120
(sighs)

03:09.856 --> 15:35.498
Nailed it.

03:15.112 --> 15:40.754
Well, as usual,

03:16.363 --> 15:42.005
this is gonna suck
for one of us.

03:20.200 --> 15:45.842
Donna? It's Grant,
your new husband.

03:22.369 --> 15:48.011
Hi, honey.

03:23.495 --> 15:49.137
I've got great news.

03:25.080 --> 15:50.722
What is it?

03:26.248 --> 15:51.890
First, where do we keep
the good scotch?

03:28.083 --> 15:53.725
At your brother's house.

03:29.710 --> 15:55.352
(audience laughing,
Peter laughing hard)

03:32.003 --> 15:57.645
I got an audition for the
hottest new play in town.

03:34.840 --> 16:00.482
This could really
make my career

03:36.717 --> 16:02.359
and we can finally
start our family.

03:38.635 --> 16:04.277
What's it called?

03:39.761 --> 16:05.403
A Passing Fancy.

03:41.263 --> 16:06.905
(audience gasps softly)

03:42.389 --> 16:08.031
(gaSPS)
That's the name of this play.

03:44.349 --> 16:09.991
How did he do that?
How did he do that?!

03:48.270 --> 16:13.912
I got you your ten-year
anniversary present.

03:51.273 --> 16:16.915
Suntan lotion?

03:52.774 --> 16:18.416
But we live
in the Northeast.

03:54.276 --> 16:19.918
That's right, we do.

03:55.902 --> 16:21.544
Unless we were moving
to California.

03:59.030 --> 16:24.672
(gaSPS)
He must've got the part.

04:00.866 --> 16:26.508
When he going
to meet Evita?

04:02.743 --> 16:28.385
Not every play is Evita.

04:04.870 --> 16:30.512
Oh, no.
| feel terrible.

04:06.955 --> 16:32.597
Why?
Don't you want to go?

04:08.582 --> 16:34.224
No-- I got you
a parka.

04:11.626 --> 16:37.268
(laughing)

04:13.128 --> 16:38.770
Those two are never
on the same page.

04:17.382 --> 16:43.024
Wait for the look...

04:19.509 --> 16:45.151
(audience laughing)

04:21.636 --> 16:47.278
And that's why it works.

04:25.390 --> 16:51.032
(crying)

04:27.142 --> 16:52.784
Donna, don't go!

04:28.643 --> 16:54.285
It's not too late.
We can still start our family.

04:31.396 --> 16:57.038
Don't you see?

04:32.522 --> 16:58.164
You already have
a family.

04:34.399 --> 17:00.041
It's right there.

04:35.901 --> 17:01.543
(audience "oohs")

04:37.986 --> 17:03.628
Those won't keep you
warm at night.

04:40.238 --> 17:05.880
Good-bye, Grant.

04:41.782 --> 17:07.424
It's funny, isn't it?

04:43.241 --> 17:08.883
All these years, I was
the passing fancy.

04:49.414 --> 17:15.056
(cheering)

04:57.130 --> 17:22.772
Get up, you jerk.

05:00.008 --> 17:25.650
(cheering)

05:12.187 --> 17:37.829
(cheering continues)

05:16.441 --> 17:42.083
Wow, that was amazing!

05:17.776 --> 17:43.418
I mean, usually,
the shows suck in this town.

05:19.820 --> 17:45.462
Like Moishe, the low-energy
Bar Mitzvah clown.

05:22.531 --> 17:48.173
Ooh, what's this?

05:24.699 --> 17:50.341
A quarter.

05:25.826 --> 17:51.468
I found it behind
your ear earlier.

05:28.036 --> 17:53.678
All right, that's enough
tricks for you.

05:29.955 --> 17:55.597
I'm going to go lie
down on the coats.

05:37.796 --> 18:03.438
Hey, has anybody seen
the review yet?

05:39.464 --> 18:05.106
No, we've been waiting for you.

05:40.590 --> 18:06.232
Thanks.

05:41.591 --> 18:07.233
Oh, here it is.

05:43.468 --> 18:09.110
"Here's hoping A Passing Fancy
is actually a staying fancy.

05:47.347 --> 18:12.989
"The highest praise goes
to playwright Brian Griffin

05:50.350 --> 18:15.992
"for his hilarious
and insightful look

05:52.227 --> 18:17.869
"into modern relationships.

05:53.478 --> 18:19.120
"If you see only one play
as an adult,

05:55.981 --> 18:21.623
I urge you to see this one."

05:57.691 --> 18:23.333
Hey, can you read
that page

05:58.984 --> 18:24.626
with all the little paragraphs
about dead people?

06:00.861 --> 18:26.503
Those are hilarious.

06:02.362 --> 18:28.004
This is amazing, Brian.
How do you feel?

06:04.364 --> 18:30.006
You're a hit!

06:05.866 --> 18:31.508
It's... overwhelming.

06:07.242 --> 18:32.884
This is all I've ever wanted,
you know?

06:09.369 --> 18:35.011
For people to appreciate
and respect my writing.

06:12.205 --> 18:37.847
I want to write
a play!

06:13.623 --> 18:39.265
(chuckles)
Aw, that's cute, Stewie.

06:15.000 --> 18:40.642
Maybe someday.

06:16.251 --> 18:41.893
No, I'm going
to write a play.

06:17.377 --> 18:43.019
I can do lots
of things.

06:18.587 --> 18:44.229
I was the human resources
director for the Muppets.

06:21.089 --> 18:46.731
Mr. Beaker, it is my
unfortunate task

06:23.216 --> 18:48.858
to inform you
that your services

06:24.593 --> 18:50.235
will no longer be required
by this company.

06:26.845 --> 18:52.487
(unintelligible squeak)

06:28.513 --> 18:54.155
Well, if you must know,

06:29.890 --> 18:55.532
it's because we've
noticed large quantities

06:31.516 --> 18:57.158
of benzene, ephedrine

06:33.268 --> 18:58.910
and everyday Epsom salt
have gone missing.

06:35.353 --> 19:00.995
(unintelligible squeak)

06:36.521 --> 19:02.163
Oh, please.

06:37.522 --> 19:03.164
We both know those
are the ingredients

06:38.773 --> 19:04.415
used to make
crystal meth.

06:40.400 --> 19:06.042
And I've got
a pretty good idea

06:41.610 --> 19:07.252
who you've been
selling it to as well.

06:43.403 --> 19:09.045
Oh, hey, uh, Beaker,

06:44.529 --> 19:10.171
when you're done
talking to your friend,

06:46.031 --> 19:11.673
I want to, uh, eh...

06:47.282 --> 19:12.924
I want to talk to you
about that thing.

06:51.912 --> 19:17.554
Hey, what you doing?

06:53.288 --> 19:18.930
I was going to start
rehearsing my new play.

06:55.040 --> 19:20.682
Want to hear it?

06:56.291 --> 19:21.933
Oh, you actually wrote
a little play.

06:58.168 --> 19:23.810
Aw, boy, | wish
I could hang out,

07:00.128 --> 19:25.770
but it has just
gotten so crazy.

07:02.422 --> 19:28.064
Really?
I know, right?

07:04.049 --> 19:29.691
I mean, I'm not
complaining, you know?

07:05.759 --> 19:31.401
But I just... I want
my old life back.

07:07.802 --> 19:33.444
(jokingly growls)

07:09.137 --> 19:34.779
I'm just kidding,
of course.

07:10.263 --> 19:35.905
I'm so grateful,
you know?

07:11.932 --> 19:37.574
I mean, every
performance is sold out

07:13.683 --> 19:39.325
and they just added
a Wednesday matinee.

07:15.310 --> 19:40.952
It's great.

07:16.561 --> 19:42.203
I mean, there's only
one thing I'm not getting

07:18.063 --> 19:43.705
out of this experience.

07:19.064 --> 19:44.706
What's that?
Sleep.

07:20.315 --> 19:45.957
(jokingly growls)

07:21.441 --> 19:47.083
No, no, I'm so
grateful, really.

07:22.692 --> 19:48.334
It's just that I'm-I'm
so busy all the time.

07:24.569 --> 19:50.211
But it's great.
It's all great.

07:25.946 --> 19:51.588
Well, do you think you might
have time to read it?

07:27.697 --> 19:53.339
(sighs)
All right, all right.

07:28.949 --> 19:54.591
But be patient,
all right?

07:30.325 --> 19:55.967
I've got interviews and
appearances all week.

07:31.910 --> 19:57.552
I mean, they're squeezing

07:33.161 --> 19:58.803
every last drop they
can out of me,

07:34.579 --> 20:00.221
like a bottle of ketchup.

07:37.707 --> 20:03.349
Listen, we've been at this
for 15 minutes.

07:39.584 --> 20:05.226
I don't think anything's
coming out.

07:41.169 --> 20:06.811
I'm fine.
I can keep going.

07:42.587 --> 20:08.229
I'm just really tired.

07:44.214 --> 20:09.856
What if I stick my finger
in your hole?

07:45.966 --> 20:11.608
Eh, that only works
when I'm already close.

07:51.930 --> 20:17.572
The American play was dying.

07:53.974 --> 20:19.616
Have-have we brought it
back to life here?

07:56.601 --> 20:22.243
I can't say that,
but it has a pulse.

07:59.104 --> 20:24.746
You're such an amazing
writer, Brian.

08:01.189 --> 20:26.831
How do you do it?
What's your process?

08:03.483 --> 20:29.125
Oh, God, Allison,
how do I even answer that?

08:06.236 --> 20:31.878
Uh, I mean, what's
a rainbow's process?

08:08.989 --> 20:34.631
Two parts rain, one part sun,
one part childlike wonder.

08:12.993 --> 20:38.635
What we do know, though,

08:14.619 --> 20:40.261
is that the end result
in both cases is joy.

08:19.666 --> 20:45.308
Wow.

08:20.875 --> 20:46.517
Wow, are you glad you left
the lighthouse now, Seamus?

08:22.794 --> 20:48.436
Oh, I think so, Seamus!

08:24.421 --> 20:50.063
Excuse me, I noticed
you were talking loud,

08:26.548 --> 20:52.190
so that means you're smart.

08:28.008 --> 20:53.650
But would you mind--
and I hate asking--

08:29.926 --> 20:55.568
but would you mind
signing this?

08:31.678 --> 20:57.320
Is this guy giving you
a hard time, Brian?

08:33.388 --> 20:59.030
Nah, he's all right.

08:34.431 --> 21:00.073
All right. Cool, cool.

08:35.640 --> 21:01.282
How you doing, buddy?

08:51.823 --> 21:17.465
(Mozart's 29th Symphony
in A Major plays)

09:13.553 --> 21:39.195
(music builds)

09:28.485 --> 21:54.127
(music ends)

09:31.946 --> 21:57.588
My God.

09:33.615 --> 21:59.257
It's miraculous.

09:36.451 --> 22:02.093
(bleep)

09:38.745 --> 22:04.387
Hey, Brian, can you
read my play?

09:40.705 --> 22:06.347
(fart noise)

09:41.706 --> 22:07.348
Sorry, there was a fart
trapped in the play.

09:49.881 --> 22:15.523
Hey, Jasper, how are you?

09:51.216 --> 22:16.858
Hey, Brian!

09:52.217 --> 22:17.859
Congratulations
on your new play.

09:54.260 --> 22:19.902
Oh, thanks.

09:55.261 --> 22:20.903
What's wrong?
You look awful.

09:56.888 --> 22:22.530
What happened?

09:58.223 --> 22:23.865
| read the play Stewie wrote.

09:59.516 --> 22:25.158
She writes plays now?

10:01.226 --> 22:26.868
Yes, and it was brilliant.

10:02.894 --> 22:28.536
Jasper, I've never read anything
like it in my life.

10:05.396 --> 22:31.038
It was insightful and fresh
and intelligent.

10:08.108 --> 22:33.750
It's like his play
is mocking me.

10:10.026 --> 22:35.668
He wrote it in a night.

10:11.486 --> 22:37.128
Ugh, that's how I feel whenever
I see Brad Goreski on Bravo.

10:14.656 --> 22:40.298
God, everyone's on Bravo but me.

10:16.658 --> 22:42.300
Anyhoo, have you told him
how good it is?

10:19.285 --> 22:44.927
No. | just read it.

10:20.411 --> 22:46.053
He gave it to me
'cause he wanted my feedback.

10:22.288 --> 22:47.930
Okay, listen to me.

10:23.248 --> 22:48.890
Tell Stewie it's awful,
it's garbage.

10:25.291 --> 22:50.933
Do whatever
you have to do, Brian,

10:26.918 --> 22:52.560
but never let him know
he's got talent.

10:28.753 --> 22:54.395
Yeah, you're right.

10:29.796 --> 22:55.438
It won't be so hard.

10:31.297 --> 22:56.939
After all, I've
certainly done worse.

10:33.174 --> 22:58.816
I replaced Peter's
| Can't Believe It's Not Butter

10:35.301 --> 23:00.943
with real butter.

10:39.430 --> 23:05.072
Buh... wuh... suh... muh-wuh...

10:42.308 --> 23:07.950
I... I can't...
I can't believe...

10:45.311 --> 23:10.953
Muh... wuh...

10:47.147 --> 23:12.789
(screaming)

10:48.314 --> 23:13.956
I don't know, Doctor.

10:49.816 --> 23:15.458
Looking back, I think it
may have been real butter.

10:52.318 --> 23:17.960
Your husband murdered
three children.

10:57.949 --> 23:23.591
Oh, my God.
Look at this.

10:59.951 --> 23:25.593
Brian, get in here.

11:01.536 --> 23:27.178
What?

11:02.537 --> 23:28.179
Your play has
been nominated

11:04.164 --> 23:29.806
for a local Hoggy Award
for Best Creative Anything.

11:08.042 --> 23:33.684
Oh, that's great.

11:09.335 --> 23:34.977
Um, I'm gonna...

11:11.838 --> 23:37.480
I'm going to go get some air.

11:15.800 --> 23:41.442
Look at that.

11:16.843 --> 23:42.485
Nominated
for an award.

11:18.344 --> 23:43.986
What have you
two done today?

11:19.804 --> 23:45.446
I found a lump
under one of my balls.

11:22.182 --> 23:47.824
Okay, that's
something.

11:23.600 --> 23:49.242
I ate three quarters
of an Entenmann's strudel.

11:25.727 --> 23:51.369
Youse are good kids.

11:31.357 --> 23:56.999
Hey, so did you get
a chance to read my play?

11:34.861 --> 24:00.503
Uh... I did.

11:36.362 --> 24:02.004
I did.

11:37.488 --> 24:03.130
Ooh, I'm so nervous.

11:38.698 --> 24:04.340
What'd you think?

11:39.991 --> 24:05.633
Stewie, you and I
are friends, right?

11:41.367 --> 24:07.009
Yeah, I mean,
I know you

11:42.368 --> 24:08.010
through our mutual
friend Greg,

11:43.578 --> 24:09.220
but sure, I'd say
we're friends now.

11:45.371 --> 24:11.013
Exactly. And-and
as your friend,

11:46.706 --> 24:12.348
you'd want me to be
honest with you, right?

11:48.499 --> 24:14.141
Totally.

11:49.584 --> 24:15.226
It wasn't good.

11:50.835 --> 24:16.477
Oh, no, really?

11:52.212 --> 24:17.854
Oh, I worked
so hard on it.

11:54.380 --> 24:20.022
Oh, I thought it
was good. Aw.

11:57.383 --> 24:23.025
Oh, I know, I wanted it
to be good so much.

12:00.595 --> 24:26.237
Oh, I am so bummed out
right now.

12:02.513 --> 24:28.155
I-I... Now I don't even know
if I should submit it.

12:04.766 --> 24:30.408
Wha... Submit it?

12:06.351 --> 24:31.993
Yeah, I was planning
to submit it

12:07.727 --> 24:33.369
to the Roundabout Theater
Company in New York.

12:09.395 --> 24:35.037
No! I mean...

12:10.396 --> 24:36.038
Oh, I mean, that-that
would be a bad idea.

12:12.232 --> 24:37.874
Definitely not.

12:13.524 --> 24:39.166
No, no, they won't let
you down easy like I did.

12:15.860 --> 24:41.502
New York can be pretty harsh,
especially to outsiders.

12:18.404 --> 24:44.046
Hello, New York!

12:20.406 --> 24:46.048
(dragon screeching)

12:22.367 --> 24:48.009
Ugh, maybe you're right.
I'll think about it.

12:24.535 --> 24:50.177
Anyway, can I have that back?
It's my only copy.

12:27.372 --> 24:53.014
Your only copy?

12:28.373 --> 24:54.015
Yes.

12:29.540 --> 24:55.182
And thank you
for being a good friend

12:30.917 --> 24:56.559
and telling me
the truth, Brian.

12:32.252 --> 24:57.894
I know that was
hard for you.

12:33.544 --> 24:59.186
And to show my appreciation
for reading my play,

12:35.922 --> 25:01.564
I made you this.

12:39.050 --> 25:04.692
Wow, "good dog."

12:40.426 --> 25:06.068
And it's official?

12:41.803 --> 25:07.445
That's what it says,
doesn't it?

12:43.304 --> 25:08.946
| wish my dad was
alive to see this.

13:01.447 --> 25:27.089
Hey.

13:02.448 --> 25:28.090
Who the hell
are you?

13:03.783 --> 25:29.425
I'm the guy Stewie pays
to watch him sleep.

13:05.660 --> 25:31.302
Who are you?

13:06.786 --> 25:32.428
I'm Brian.
I live here.

13:08.288 --> 25:33.930
Oh.

13:09.664 --> 25:35.306
Do you mind if
I take this script?

13:11.457 --> 25:37.099
Yeah, sure, whatever.

13:12.583 --> 25:38.225
He just pays me
to watch him sleep

13:14.210 --> 25:39.852
and rub this knife
across my face while I do it.

13:16.462 --> 25:42.104
Oh.

13:18.423 --> 25:44.065
Okay.

13:21.592 --> 25:47.234
Hey, how much
does Stewie pay you?

13:23.469 --> 25:49.111
$4,800 a week.

13:25.305 --> 25:50.947
(bleep)

13:26.472 --> 25:52.114
Yeah.

13:31.227 --> 25:56.869
Hey, Brian.

13:32.312 --> 25:57.954
Oh, hey, Stewie.

13:33.479 --> 25:59.121
Listen, have you
seen my play?

13:34.856 --> 26:00.498
You know, Stewie,
I have seen your play,

13:36.691 --> 26:02.333
and it is
exhilarating to me.

13:39.235 --> 26:04.877
A child's play is one of

13:41.195 --> 26:06.837
the most beautiful
things in the world.

13:42.864 --> 26:08.506
Continue to play,
little one.

13:44.824 --> 26:10.466
You're our future.

13:46.326 --> 26:11.968
What the (bleep) are
you talking about?

13:48.328 --> 26:13.970
The play I wrote.
Have you seen it?

13:49.871 --> 26:15.513
Uh, I don't know.
Let me call my lawyer.

13:51.748 --> 26:17.390
(chuckles)
Hello. I'm being
cross-examined.

13:53.374 --> 26:19.016
No, I haven't...
I haven't seen it.

13:55.335 --> 26:20.977
Really? 'Cause I had it
sitting right on my table...

13:57.462 --> 26:23.104
I said I haven't
seen it, all right!

13:59.255 --> 26:24.897
And what does it matter?
It was terrible anyway!

14:00.965 --> 26:26.607
We've had this conversation!

14:02.133 --> 26:27.775
Do yourself a favor
and move on!

14:03.509 --> 26:29.151
Well, that's interesting, Brian,
because I found this

14:05.470 --> 26:31.112
buried in the backyard
next to your soup bone.

14:08.348 --> 26:33.990
(gasps)

14:09.390 --> 26:35.032
Stewie, I...

14:10.516 --> 26:36.158
You tried to destroy it,
didn't you?

14:12.018 --> 26:37.660
I knew my play was good.

14:13.519 --> 26:39.161
Just like I knew your play
was a mediocre patchwork

14:15.646 --> 26:41.288
of hackneyed ideas
and tired clichÃ©s.

14:18.024 --> 26:43.666
You have no idea how hard it was

14:20.234 --> 26:45.876
to sit in that theater
with all those braying hyenas.

14:22.528 --> 26:48.170
Couldn't you tell
something was up

14:24.530 --> 26:50.172
when Chris and the fat man
could follow the plot?

14:26.908 --> 26:52.550
I mean, it took Peter a year
to figure out Stuart Little.

14:31.245 --> 26:56.887
| just figured it out.

14:32.538 --> 26:58.180
"Stuart" means "mouse."

14:33.664 --> 26:59.306
No, Peter.

14:35.917 --> 27:01.559
"Little" means "mouse"?

14:37.668 --> 27:03.310
No, Peter.

14:39.003 --> 27:04.645
| feel so old
and in the way.

14:42.382 --> 27:08.024
It's still a good play!

14:43.549 --> 27:09.191
It's filled with terrible
double entendres,

14:45.385 --> 27:11.027
puns and stolen bits.

14:46.928 --> 27:12.570
There's a line in there
from Seinfeld!

14:48.513 --> 27:14.155
I never saw that episode!

14:50.264 --> 27:15.906
I have a voice.

14:51.391 --> 27:17.033
Do you understand that?

14:52.517 --> 27:18.159
A writer needs a voice,
and I have one.

14:54.185 --> 27:19.827
You don't.

14:55.520 --> 27:21.162
Your play panders to the lowest
common denominator, Brian.

14:58.189 --> 27:23.831
And it doesn't even
do that well.

15:00.191 --> 27:25.833
Shut up!

15:00.817 --> 27:26.459
May every person

15:02.402 --> 27:28.044
that laughs at your
sophomoric effort

15:04.195 --> 27:29.837
be a reminder
of your eternal mediocrity

15:06.447 --> 27:32.089
and pierce your heart
like a knife.

15:15.581 --> 27:41.223
(squirrel chittering)

15:18.418 --> 27:44.060
Come here, you bastard!

15:19.710 --> 27:45.352
(barking)

15:22.422 --> 27:48.064
You stink!

15:23.548 --> 27:49.190
And your play stinks!

15:24.966 --> 27:50.608
This ain't about me, is it?

15:26.968 --> 27:52.610
(sobbing)

15:30.430 --> 27:56.072
No.

15:32.432 --> 27:58.074
And I'm sorry...

15:34.725 --> 28:00.367
but nobody can ever know that.

15:37.603 --> 28:03.245
(bone cracking)

15:42.984 --> 28:08.626
Donna? It's Grant,
your new husband!

15:44.944 --> 28:10.586
Hi, honey.

15:45.987 --> 28:11.629
I've got
great news.

15:47.447 --> 28:13.089
What is it?

15:48.448 --> 28:14.090
First, where do we keep
the good scotch?

15:50.324 --> 28:15.966
At your
brother's house.

15:51.742 --> 28:17.384
(audience laughing,
Peter laughing hard)

15:54.620 --> 28:20.262
PETER:
Lois, can I have
my birthday here?

15:56.622 --> 28:22.264
Seems to be going well.

15:58.458 --> 28:24.100
What do you want?

15:59.625 --> 28:25.267
Wanted to share
a bit of good news.

16:01.127 --> 28:26.769
| just found out
that my play

16:03.004 --> 28:28.646
is going to be
produced on Broadway.

16:05.006 --> 28:30.648
What?

16:06.507 --> 28:32.149
And I'm taking Randall
Evan Battincourt with me.

16:09.469 --> 28:35.111
Hi, Stewie.
I'll be right there.

16:10.761 --> 28:36.403
| just got to
finish this crap.

16:18.019 --> 28:43.661
Hey, I need you
to take me to New York

16:19.979 --> 28:45.621
for the opening night
of my play.

16:21.647 --> 28:47.289
(scoffs)
No way.

16:22.648 --> 28:48.290
Besides, I checked,
and there's no play

16:24.275 --> 28:49.917
by Stewie Griffin
opening in New York.

16:26.152 --> 28:51.794
I submitted it
under a pseudonym.

16:27.612 --> 28:53.254
They think it was written
by Tony Dovolani.

16:29.864 --> 28:55.506
I thought your pseudonym
was Gorgeous Randy Flamethrower.

16:32.366 --> 28:58.008
That's my dodge ball
pseudonym.

16:34.494 --> 29:00.136
Look, if you won't take me,

16:35.870 --> 29:01.512
I'm sure the New York Theater
League would send a car.

16:38.122 --> 29:03.764
New York Theater League? Why?

16:39.665 --> 29:05.307
Because they're throwing
a welcome dinner in my honor.

16:42.001 --> 29:07.643
Really?

16:43.044 --> 29:08.686
Well, I guess I could
clear my schedule.

16:45.046 --> 29:10.688
Oh, you won't
regret it, Brian.

16:46.506 --> 29:12.148
All the most important
Broadway people will be there.

16:49.509 --> 29:15.151
Playwrights, money men,
even Stanley Kowalski.

16:52.386 --> 29:18.028
Hi. I'm Michael.

16:53.638 --> 29:19.280
Michael!

16:58.226 --> 29:23.868
Um, and this is my wife, Nancy.

17:00.228 --> 29:25.870
Nancy!

17:05.274 --> 29:30.916
And this is our Uzbekistani
friend, Bokyavroychesku.

17:08.861 --> 29:34.503
Hi.

17:13.157 --> 29:38.799
(indistinct conversations)

17:17.286 --> 29:42.928
Stewie, don't you think you're
overdoing it with that outfit?

17:19.539 --> 29:45.181
I don't wear anything I can't
take off with a flourish.

17:25.169 --> 29:50.811
Wow, this is amazing.

17:27.171 --> 29:52.813
Every major
playwright is here.

17:28.881 --> 29:54.523
Yes, and it seems to be
quite a successful party.

17:31.050 --> 29:56.692
Several of them have
already committed suicide.

17:33.177 --> 29:58.819
Great party.

17:34.262 --> 29:59.904
Totally!

17:36.681 --> 30:02.323
MAN:
Hey, Tony.

17:37.890 --> 30:03.532
Oh, my God,
that's David Mamet.

17:39.517 --> 30:05.159
There's the man
of the evening.

17:40.768 --> 30:06.410
| read your play,
An American Marriage.

17:43.396 --> 30:09.038
It was incredibly raw.
I was pretty damn impressed.

17:46.440 --> 30:12.082
Oh, thank you, David.

17:47.567 --> 30:13.209
David, this is Brian.
Brian, David.

17:49.569 --> 30:15.211
Oh, it's an honor.

17:50.570 --> 30:16.212
Listen, | just
want to say

17:52.029 --> 30:17.671
what an inspiration
Glengarry Glen Ross was to me

17:53.698 --> 30:19.340
when I was writing
my own play.

17:55.408 --> 30:21.050
Easy.

17:56.409 --> 30:22.051
Is that
Tony Dovolani?

17:57.827 --> 30:23.469
Hello. Alan Bennett.

17:59.287 --> 30:24.929
Fantastic play.

18:00.955 --> 30:26.597
And I'm
Yasmina Reza.

18:02.582 --> 30:28.224
Oh, are you his night nurse?

18:04.208 --> 30:29.850
No, I'm
a playwright.

18:05.918 --> 30:31.560
I wrote Art and
God of Carnage.

18:07.545 --> 30:33.187
I won
a Pulitzer.

18:08.963 --> 30:34.605
You want to say your
grade point average, too?

18:11.215 --> 30:36.857
Boy, it's just
so weird to be in a room

18:13.342 --> 30:38.984
where every single person
in the room is a playwright.

18:15.595 --> 30:41.237
Every single
one of us.

18:17.221 --> 30:42.863
Everyone.

18:18.222 --> 30:43.864
Including me.

18:19.807 --> 30:45.449
I'm a playwright.

18:21.309 --> 30:46.951
Brian, my God,
take it down a notch.

18:23.352 --> 30:48.994
You're a playwright?
In New York?

18:25.062 --> 30:50.704
Well, Quahog,
Rhode Island.

18:26.606 --> 30:52.248
You're kidding.

18:28.232 --> 30:53.874
We just went and saw a play
in Quahog, Rhode Island.

18:29.942 --> 30:55.584
Really?

18:31.110 --> 30:56.752
Have you ever heard
of A Passing Fancy?

18:33.446 --> 30:59.088
Ihave!

18:34.572 --> 31:00.214
Oh, my God,
what a load of rubbish.

18:37.116 --> 31:02.758
(chuckles)

18:38.117 --> 31:03.759
We have this thing
where we go

18:39.327 --> 31:04.969
to the worst regional theater
we can find

18:40.953 --> 31:06.595
and laugh ourselves sick.

18:42.747 --> 31:08.389
And this one took
the grand prize.

18:45.249 --> 31:10.891
(laughing)

18:47.251 --> 31:12.893
Really?

18:48.461 --> 31:14.103
|-| had heard
only good things.

18:51.005 --> 31:16.647
It was a (bleep) piece
of (bleep) on a (bleep)!

18:54.258 --> 31:19.900
(laughing)

18:55.635 --> 31:21.277
Oh, my God.

18:56.636 --> 31:22.278
I got to hear David Mamet
curse in person.

19:09.607 --> 31:35.249
Oh, there you are.

19:11.400 --> 31:37.042
That was the worst
night of my life.

19:14.153 --> 31:39.795
It's not like you were
the only fat guy in there.

19:16.280 --> 31:41.922
What?

19:17.281 --> 31:42.923
Oh, this is about
the play. Sorry.

19:19.408 --> 31:45.050
I was so happy until
I read your play, Stewie.

19:22.787 --> 31:48.429
I finally had some kind
of success as a writer.

19:26.040 --> 31:51.682
It wasn't big,
but it was mine.

19:27.792 --> 31:53.434
I was fine being an okay writer,

19:30.169 --> 31:55.811
until I discovered I was living
in a house with a brilliant one.

19:33.297 --> 31:58.939
I know we don't talk
about doggy years a lot,

19:35.633 --> 32:01.275
but |-| just wish
you could have waited

19:38.010 --> 32:03.652
to find out how talented
you were until I was gone.

19:41.305 --> 32:06.947
By the time I'm dead,
you won't even be ten.

19:43.683 --> 32:09.325
You'll have 70 more years
to be great.

19:45.810 --> 32:11.452
| just wish I could have
had five to be good.

19:50.022 --> 32:15.664
There's your voice, Brian.

19:51.816 --> 32:17.458
It's a depressing voice,
but it's yours.

19:54.193 --> 32:19.835
Write from that.

19:55.528 --> 32:21.170
Listen, me and
the other playwrights

19:57.321 --> 32:22.963
are going out
to have drinks

19:58.698 --> 32:24.340
with Woody Allen
and his daughter-wife.

20:00.324 --> 32:25.966
You want to come?

20:01.450 --> 32:27.092
All right.

20:02.702 --> 32:28.344
We can just sit here
for a while.

20:07.707 --> 32:33.349
They talked a lot more crap
about you after you left.

20:18.050 --> 32:43.692
Oh, God, that
was just terrible.
Terrible.

20:20.720 --> 32:46.362
I don't understand.

20:22.346 --> 32:47.988
Stewie, what happened
to the play you wrote?

20:24.473 --> 32:50.115
That was terrible.

20:25.933 --> 32:51.575
Well, I gave it
a final polish.

20:27.226 --> 32:52.868
Changed a few things.

20:28.352 --> 32:53.994
Guess I kind of mucked
the whole thing up.

20:30.479 --> 32:56.121
But how? You...

20:33.357 --> 32:58.999
Did you do that... for me?

20:36.193 --> 33:01.835
What are you talking about?
I'm a young writer.

20:37.862 --> 33:03.504
| just wasn't as ready
as I thought I was.

20:39.613 --> 33:05.255
Maybe in a couple of years,
who knows?

20:42.241 --> 33:07.883
Stewie, you shouldn't
have done that.

20:44.368 --> 33:10.010
But... thanks.

20:46.996 --> 33:12.638
No problem, Brian.

20:48.748 --> 33:14.390
Hey, what do you say
we head back home?
That sounds good.

20:51.250 --> 33:16.892
You know, I'm going to move to
New York City when I'm older,

20:53.878 --> 33:19.520
'cause it's
twinkly and big

20:55.379 --> 33:21.021
and this is where
dreams come true,

20:56.756 --> 33:22.398
and that giant bird's
coming for us, isn't he?
