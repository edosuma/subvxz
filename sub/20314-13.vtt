it for some time.

I want you to know, it has been
a privilege and an honour

02:53.417 --> 02:57.542
to work with you all for these

change.

-The sky's the limit.

about next year.

-I don't know, Carter's coached
like, what, four teams, right?

04:28.291 --> 04:31.041
Sometimes people just go on the
volume of teams you coach.

04:31.083 --> 04:33.250
You coached the championship
team.

-Shh, hey Carter.
What did he coach?

04:36.208 --> 04:39.166
Swimming, badminton,
cross country.

-What is that?
Cross country?

though, so...

is mostly on the math. I'm...

thought about it. So...

see me, your guidance

It is my job to think
about it for you.

extra-curricular activities and
interests

good grades for...
-No.

-That seems is pretty
unlikely for me.

06:07.125 --> 06:10.834
-Well, they said it was
unlikely I'd walk. I swim,
five times a week.

06:10.875 --> 06:14.417
-That's not really walking.
-It's harder. Trust me.

06:14.458 --> 06:16.750
-Okay.
-I know I'm right about this.

06:16.792 --> 06:20.125

be deep in my mouth.

-Okay, but, Lisa's sitting
there.

06:32.542 --> 06:34.709
-I need both of you here
for this.
-Okay.

06:37.667 --> 06:42.709
Can I just say quickly, I am
sick about the idea of you
leaving.

06:42.750 --> 06:47.583
But, the prospect of filling
your gaping hole does appeal
to me.

06:47.625 --> 06:51.000
-Robert, the board has informed
that when I do leave...

06:51.041 --> 06:53.583
They would Lisa to become
the principal.

06:53.625 --> 06:55.750
-Wh...Why would they like that?

06:55.792 --> 07:00.083
-They feel with her PhD and
her principal courses that she's
the right choice for the job.

07:00.125 --> 07:02.917
At least on an interim basis.
-[Robert]: Umm...

07:02.959 --> 07:06.208
What did you say?
-I said that I thought you
were also a good choice.

07:06.250 --> 07:08.458
-Aww.

07:08.500 --> 07:11.917
-But that I would defer to the
board and offer Ms. Mason
the job.

07:11.959 --> 07:15.542
-And what did you say?
-I said yes.

07:15.583 --> 07:17.542
-As only Judas would.

07:19.291 --> 07:22.583
Well, I guess you got your
gaping hole filled, just like
you wanted, then.

07:22.625 --> 07:25.041
-Robert, I know that you
had other expectations.

07:25.083 --> 07:28.083
Truthfully, I think that you
two will make a great team.

07:28.125 --> 07:30.375
-You won't have to
change offices.

07:30.417 --> 07:33.583
-Ohh, is it a principal joke?
'Cause I wouldn't get that.

07:33.625 --> 07:36.542
Vice principal jokes
and this joke...

07:37.625 --> 07:40.458
Those are the kind of
jokes I get.

07:40.500 --> 07:42.375
Thank you.

07:43.458 --> 07:45.750
-Well that went better
than I thought it would.

-So, the vote for male athlete
of the year is unanimous.

07:54.250 --> 07:56.667
It's going to go to Terrence
Giffer. So that's great.

07:56.709 --> 07:59.333
-Who was on the basketball team.
-Big T.

07:59.375 --> 08:01.583
-Yeah, that doesn't really
matter, so...

08:01.625 --> 08:03.667
Then finally we've got the
Coach of the Year award.

08:03.709 --> 08:05.917
So for obvious reasons we
will be doing a secret ballot.

08:05.959 --> 08:08.834
So just write a name on the
ballot, fold it up, pop it in
the bowl.

08:08.875 --> 08:11.083
Boom. Simple huh?
-[Gerry]: Ah Bobbi?

08:11.125 --> 08:13.750
Perhaps it would be helpful if
we all went around and

08:13.792 --> 08:16.583
and just reiterated what we
did this year as coaches.

08:16.625 --> 08:18.834
-That's not necessary, let's
just write names on the ballots,
okay?

08:20.542 --> 08:23.250
-No, we don't need to do that.
Let's just write a name.

I believe I coached the
championship game.

-Oh right, you were kicked
out of the last game.
Forgot about that.

-One game doesn't win you
a championship.

championship game.

Like a name.

-Is there a way to tell if
people vote for themself?

-No, of course not. No.
-Not really, stupid right?

08:44.834 --> 08:46.750

and make sure you're okay
with everything?

-No Lisa. I would say I am
not okay with everything.

09:10.583 --> 09:14.875
-Yeah.
-No one else is going to be
okay with everything either.

09:14.917 --> 09:17.166

being a little dramatic.

I used to have friends, Lisa.

Back before I was admin,
people liked me a lot.

them laughing behind my back?

And sometimes to my face?
I can hear it in my sleep.

-Naive little Lisa.

-Yeah.
-So, what's the verdict.

10:33.417 --> 10:35.875
-Mr. D!
-[Gerry laughs]: You think?

10:35.917 --> 10:38.667
-I shouldn't be telling you this
because it's supposed to be a
secret, but...

10:38.709 --> 10:40.792
[Whispers]: I voted for you.
-Oh, I know you did.

10:40.834 --> 10:43.000
I voted for me too.
Why wouldn't I?

10:43.041 --> 10:45.917
Bobbi practically told me
I won it already anyway.

10:45.959 --> 10:48.750
-Really? What'd she say?
-Yeah. It's what she didn't say.

10:48.792 --> 10:51.041
-I'm always trying to figure out
what people aren't saying.

10:51.083 --> 10:53.625
-Ahhh.
-Can't crack that nut.

10:53.667 --> 10:55.875
-I just want to see
my name on it.

10:55.917 --> 10:58.083
I'm wanna pull this tape
off, just a peek.
-[Simon]: Yeah...

10:58.125 --> 11:00.333
-[Gerry]: The winner's under
that tape.
-[Simon]: Yeah.

11:00.375 --> 11:02.792
-Just a peek.
-[Simon]: Gerry!

11:02.834 --> 11:04.834
-Cops, Cops! Gerry!

11:04.875 --> 11:08.667
-Hey Malik. Just looking at the
trophies Mr. Malik.

11:08.709 --> 11:10.917
-[Simon]: Gerry, Gerry!
-Can you do me a favour?

11:10.959 --> 11:12.875
Can you, ah...
-Gerry, through here!

11:12.917 --> 11:15.875
-...Dust this piece of tape
stuck on that?

11:15.917 --> 11:18.417
-Like that?
-No, but harder, so
that maybe the...

11:18.458 --> 11:20.667
Dust it so the tape might...
-But there's no dust.

11:20.709 --> 11:22.458
-Gerry!

11:23.375 --> 11:25.959
-You never saw me here. Okay?
-Shhh.

11:29.834 --> 11:32.750
-Hey, it's a great sign.

11:32.792 --> 11:35.000
Nobody told me we were
throwing a party.

11:35.041 --> 11:37.041
-I did not know we
needed your permission.

11:37.083 --> 11:39.667
-No, I wasn't saying that.
-[Trudy]: Just so we're clear,

11:39.709 --> 11:42.333
I don't do coffee runs,
I don't do over time.

11:42.375 --> 11:45.500
And I do do Jewish holidays off.
-[Laughs]: Do, do.

11:45.542 --> 11:49.083
-You're not Jewish, are you?
-I don't believe you can legally
ask me that.

11:49.125 --> 11:52.250
So, I'll be taking off
Yom Kippur, Hanukkah...

11:52.291 --> 11:54.917
And that other one.
-Good for you.

11:54.959 --> 11:57.125
-Look you guys, nothing's
changed. Okay?

11:57.166 --> 11:59.959
I'm still the same old Lisa.
-Mazel Tov.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.208
-[Frank]: Jimmy!
-Hey Frank.

12:02.250 --> 12:04.500
-My gut was wrong when I
said you should be a dentist.

12:04.542 --> 12:06.709
-Yeah, I figured.
-Lawyer.

12:06.750 --> 12:08.959
-Hmmm?
-You are clearly destined for
legal greatness.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.208
-You need even better grades to
get into law.

12:11.250 --> 12:13.458
And I just have no interest
in it.

12:13.500 --> 12:16.041
-Oh see, that is a great
argument. Your jib was
cut for law.

12:16.083 --> 12:18.500
-That doesn't make any sense.
-Can't dispute that legal mind.

12:18.542 --> 12:20.583
Your honour.

12:20.959 --> 12:24.959
[♪ Music]

12:25.000 --> 12:27.959
-Hey Lisa, I just thought I'd
say congratulations on becoming

12:28.000 --> 12:31.083
the new principal of the school.
I think it's a great choice.

12:31.125 --> 12:33.834
-Oh, thank you Gerry.
You know I...

12:33.875 --> 12:36.125
-[Whispers]: Blah, blah, blah.
Give me phys ed.

12:36.166 --> 12:39.083
-What? Gerry I just got the job,
I don't think I can just give
you phys ed.

12:39.125 --> 12:42.083
-Why not?
-Yeah, why not Lisa?

12:42.125 --> 12:44.375
-Well, there might be a
scheduling issue.

12:44.417 --> 12:46.583
-[Robert]: Who do you think
makes the schedule now?

12:46.625 --> 12:50.667
-You make the schedule now. And
we're friends, so this should be
a no brainer, right?

12:50.709 --> 12:54.959
-Everybody loves friends.
Come on, you call the shots
now, give him Phys ed, Big Time.

12:55.000 --> 13:00.041
-Fine, I never felt you belonged
in a classroom anyway.

13:00.083 --> 13:02.417
-Thank you. Thank you,
thank you.

13:02.458 --> 13:04.875
-[Robert]: Easy peasy.
-Phys Ed next year.

13:04.917 --> 13:08.625
-Wow.
-Oh my god. You are a
good person for doing this.

13:08.667 --> 13:10.917
-Despite what they say.
-What do they say?

13:10.959 --> 13:13.542
-Huh?
-That was him, I never
said that.

13:13.583 --> 13:15.750
Soo...You should be careful.

13:15.792 --> 13:17.959
-Congratulations.
-[Gerry]: Thank you.

13:18.000 --> 13:21.041
-[Robert]: I can't believe you
gave him gym. He's a menace
in the gym.

13:21.083 --> 13:24.166
-You told me to!
-Doesn't matter, you don't
take orders from me.

13:24.208 --> 13:26.875
Nice goin' principal!

13:32.667 --> 13:34.917
-And I'd like to thank my
teammate Sharon.

13:34.959 --> 13:37.500
For being the best defence
partner that anyone could
hope for.

13:37.542 --> 13:41.083
-It's field hockey Andrea, get
off the stage. No one cares.

13:41.125 --> 13:43.083
-I'll cherish this award.

13:43.125 --> 13:46.166
-[Applause]

13:46.208 --> 13:48.834
-Congratulations Andrea.

13:48.875 --> 13:52.125
And now that brings us to the
final award of this afternoon.

13:52.166 --> 13:54.291
-[Simon]: Ohhh!
-[Bobbi]: And that is
Coach of the Year.

13:54.333 --> 13:57.125
-[Applause]

13:57.166 --> 13:59.458
-This award has a long and
meaningful history here at
Xavier.

13:59.500 --> 14:02.208
-[Gerry]: Hey, let me sit on
the outside so I can get to
the stage quicker.

14:02.250 --> 14:04.917
'Cause you've never won
and never will, probably ever.
-[Simon]: Yup.

14:04.959 --> 14:07.500
The senior boys basketball team
had another undefeated year.

14:07.542 --> 14:11.125
Which led them to yet another
league championship.

14:11.166 --> 14:14.166
-[Applause and cheering]

14:14.208 --> 14:17.125
-[Applause and cheering]

14:17.166 --> 14:20.709
-[Applause and cheering]
-No losses.

14:20.750 --> 14:23.917
-And really, there was only one
candidate for this award.

14:23.959 --> 14:28.000
Ladies and gentlemen, your
Coach of the Year, Coach Keenan!

14:28.041 --> 14:32.083
-[Applause and cheering]
-[Bobbi]: Yeah!

14:32.125 --> 14:35.083
-Perfect amount of surprise.
-[Applause and cheering]

14:35.125 --> 14:38.625
-Thank you, everyone.
I didn't expect to win an
award this year.

14:38.667 --> 14:40.959
-[Bobbi laughs]
-No kidding.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.458
-This is truly a great honour.

14:43.500 --> 14:45.792
I'd like to thank the boys
on the team.

14:45.834 --> 14:50.250
Without their help I wouldn't
have been able to earn this
award.

14:50.291 --> 14:53.083
-Earn what? You didn't
do anything!
-[Quietly]: Gerry, shut it!

14:53.125 --> 14:55.083
-Duncan? Is that you?
What did you say?

14:55.125 --> 14:58.083
-I said you didn't do anything,
this is for Coach of this year.

14:58.125 --> 15:00.458
Coach of this year.
Not what you did in the past.

15:00.500 --> 15:03.792
-The other coaches obviously
feel I deserve this award.

15:03.834 --> 15:07.083
-Come on! They gave it to ya
because they feel sorry for you.

15:07.125 --> 15:09.458
-Gerry, that is enough!
-Why didn't you just
send him flowers?

15:09.500 --> 15:12.291
-[Bobbi]: Come on!
-Well you can't give him the
award, he didn't do anything.

15:12.333 --> 15:15.000
-What are you saying Duncan?
Are you saying you should have
won this?

15:15.041 --> 15:17.041
-Obviously, I'm the one
that coached them.

15:17.083 --> 15:20.208
-Oh, give me a break. You
couldn't coach your way out
of a wet paper bag.

15:20.250 --> 15:23.250
-[Laughs]
-At least I was conscious
for their games.

15:23.291 --> 15:26.250
-I was having valve replacement
surgery.

15:26.291 --> 15:28.542
-Oh, like there's such a thing.

15:28.583 --> 15:31.250
Well, while you were having your
valves replaced or whatever

15:31.291 --> 15:34.041
I was actually coaching them
to a city championship.

15:34.083 --> 15:36.250
-You call that coaching?
[Keenan takes a few breaths]

15:36.291 --> 15:38.625
The boys were begging
me to come back.

15:38.667 --> 15:41.208
-I heard your wife wasn't even
begging you to come back.

15:41.250 --> 15:43.458
-[Bobbi]: Gerry!
-[Gerry]: It's a joke,
it's a joke.

15:43.500 --> 15:45.875
-[Keenan]: You son of a...

15:45.917 --> 15:48.083
-Oh where'd he go?
The screen froze.

15:48.125 --> 15:50.041
Get him back, I want to
hear what he has to say.

15:50.083 --> 15:52.542
Get the IT guy, I want to
continue...Oh!
[Auditorium gasps]

15:52.583 --> 15:54.750
-[Nurse]: Clear!
-[Bobbi]: Okay, can you
cut that please?

15:54.792 --> 15:57.667
-[Gerry]: Coach...?
-[Simon]: Ahhhhhhhhhhhh...

15:57.709 --> 16:01.041
Ahhhhhhhhhhhh...
-[Nurse]: Clear.

16:01.083 --> 16:03.542
-[Auditorium gasps]
-[Bobbi]: Oh my, cut this!

16:03.583 --> 16:06.166
-Ahhhhhhh...
-[Gerry]: He's asleep.

16:06.208 --> 16:09.709
[Gerry]: Oh god, no, no.
Wake up, wake up. Wake up.

16:09.750 --> 16:12.125
-[Simon]: I guess you'll get it
next year Gerry, for sure.

This is the right thing to do.
-Excuse me, what's going on?

17:02.291 --> 17:06.250
-Your dad should have had this.
And he should be Coach of the
Year forever.

-[Keenan's son]: What? What?
-[Dwyer]: Gerry, stop.

17:08.542 --> 17:13.000
-No, it'll fit. Trudy, don't.
It's just a bit big.

17:13.041 --> 17:16.041
-Gerry stop, it's too much.
-No, I can get it in.

17:16.083 --> 17:19.875
I know I can get it in.

these so big?

-Hey, I assume we're not
going back to celebrate
Callaghan's retirement, right?

18:20.417 --> 18:23.291
-No. I don't think he
really felt like it.

18:23.333 --> 18:25.250
-Yeah.
-For obvious reasons.

18:25.291 --> 18:27.542
Yeah, good decision.
Ahh...

18:27.583 --> 18:31.417
Could I maybe sit down with
you just to discuss a few
Phys Ed matters for next year?

18:31.458 --> 18:33.375
-Gerry, you know that's
not gonna happen.

18:33.417 --> 18:35.667
-Okay, what about next
week then?

18:35.709 --> 18:37.917
-Gerry, you're not getting
the Phys Ed job.

I wasn't going to
do this here, but...

-I'm not renewing your contract.

right now?

19:01.500 --> 19:03.542
-How was detention?
-It was good.

19:03.583 --> 19:05.792
-Have you thought anymore
about your career?

19:05.834 --> 19:08.875
-You know what? I actually just
got promoted to manager at
Barrels.

19:08.917 --> 19:10.917
-Show me your hands.
-Again?

19:12.166 --> 19:14.375
-Ahh, yes. Yes.

19:14.417 --> 19:16.709
Your management line does
cross the dentist line.

19:16.750 --> 19:20.375
Wow, these hands.
These strong hands...

19:20.417 --> 19:25.333
Will make schedules for servers
who serve dentists and lawyers.

19:25.375 --> 19:28.208
Damn, I'm good.
Real good.

19:31.792 --> 19:33.625
My management line?

Oh, no, no, no.
Frank, that's a scar.

killed a guy, sir.

19:39.417 --> 19:42.750
-I didn't kill anyone Alex,
okay? It was just bad luck
for me.

19:42.792 --> 19:45.041
-Yeah, I'm with ya.

19:45.083 --> 19:47.333

you next year?

19:47.375 --> 19:49.458
-[Gerry]: I don't know.

19:49.500 --> 19:52.583
-[Alex]: Well, I hope they don't
give us a teacher who spends
the whole class teaching.

19:52.625 --> 19:55.083
-[Gerry laughs]
-Or a teacher who plans their
lessons in advance.

19:55.125 --> 19:57.375
Or someone who doesn't tell
us about their weekend.

19:57.417 --> 19:59.417
How are we supposed to learn
about the real world?

19:59.458 --> 20:01.709
-Thanks Alex.

20:01.750 --> 20:03.959
Hey!
-Yeah?

-Take this to my car, will ya?
-What's your car?

-It's a grey one.
-Okay.

20:08.417 --> 20:10.667
