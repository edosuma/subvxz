- [Paul] Paul Brooks
journal day 518.

03:49.272 --> 03:50.491
It was once said
that those suffering

03:50.534 --> 03:53.015
from the incapacity to
love are living in hell.

03:54.364 --> 03:56.540
I often wonder if Dostoevsky
wanted to say more

03:57.802 --> 03:59.674
because what I know
of hell isn't simply

03:59.717 --> 04:01.545
a place where love
doesn't exist.

04:02.546 --> 04:04.418
Nor is it a place
you go when you die.

04:05.723 --> 04:08.726
Hell is here in this facility.

04:08.770 --> 04:12.208
In the body and in the
mind, hell is a battle

04:12.252 --> 04:15.429
you know you will one day lose.

04:15.472 --> 04:17.474
It's waking up every
morning with the very

04:17.517 --> 04:19.476
real threat that it
could be your last.

04:21.565 --> 04:23.959
It's watching other
human beings starve.

04:24.002 --> 04:27.310
While those with the
means ignore them.

04:28.529 --> 04:31.401
It's placing the
hope for humanity

04:31.445 --> 04:32.707
on artificial intelligence.

04:34.970 --> 04:37.581
It's having a daughter you
don't recognize anymore

04:38.713 --> 04:40.410
and who doesn't
recognize you anymore.

04:41.977 --> 04:45.067
Hell is what the East
inflicted on us two years ago

04:45.110 --> 04:47.765
when they pushed the
button on day zero.

04:47.809 --> 04:51.421
And now as our food supplies
run drastically low,

04:51.465 --> 04:52.944
our friends and
families forced into

04:52.988 --> 04:55.469
punishment details with
substandard equipment.

04:56.948 --> 04:58.602
Our continued attempts
to communicate

04:58.646 --> 05:00.125
with other facilities failing.

05:01.388 --> 05:02.737
Hell is creeping in
to the collective

05:02.780 --> 05:04.434
conscious of those that remain.

05:05.566 --> 05:07.916
The reason and rational
is all but depleted.

05:09.265 --> 05:11.485
I wish I knew what
the future holds

05:11.528 --> 05:14.009
but that would mean believing
that there is a future.

05:15.358 --> 05:18.100
I don't know how much
longer we have left.

06:19.422 --> 06:20.380
- [Broadman] McMan
got caught in the fog.

06:20.423 --> 06:22.947
He's still out there, save him.

06:22.991 --> 06:26.124
- [Frost] It's too late
Broadman, it's too late.

06:26.168 --> 06:27.778
Let's just get you to Medicon.

06:31.216 --> 06:34.437
[dramatic music]

06:34.481 --> 06:37.440
- [Broadman] What will
your father make of this?

06:37.484 --> 06:38.746
He could have saved him.

06:40.835 --> 06:42.837
- [Alexa] We don't know that.

06:42.880 --> 06:43.794
- [Broadman] Don't we?

06:45.796 --> 06:50.018
- [Computer] Good morning Eden
this is day zero minus 364.

06:51.759 --> 06:55.240
Pollution and radiation
levels remain constant.

06:55.284 --> 06:58.156
No other survivors
have been located.

06:58.200 --> 07:00.985
Standby for the President's
daily announcement.

07:02.378 --> 07:04.380
- [President] While we
continue to work tirelessly

07:04.424 --> 07:06.948
to reach other
groups of survivors

07:06.991 --> 07:09.167
due to food shortages
every citizen

07:09.211 --> 07:11.953
will be on three quarter
rations as of today.

07:13.345 --> 07:15.957
Remember this is for your
own safety and well being.

07:24.922 --> 07:26.750
- I was out there
too long wasn't I?

07:26.794 --> 07:29.057
- That's for Dr. Macdonald
to assess and not me.

07:31.363 --> 07:34.018
Broadman late back from
punishment detail doctor.

07:34.062 --> 07:35.019
- How long was he exposed?

07:35.063 --> 07:36.194
- About three minutes.

07:38.675 --> 07:40.329
- Fair amount of time then.

07:40.372 --> 07:43.941
Do you want to get on the bed?

07:45.900 --> 07:48.424
- [Computer] Bioscan activated.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.600
Subject Broadman, Richard.
- How's she getting along?

07:50.644 --> 07:53.777
- You know her, never
sleeps never eats.

07:53.821 --> 07:58.042
All she does is work
on him, our last hope.

08:02.003 --> 08:05.049
[contemplative music]

08:12.970 --> 08:15.364
- [Computer] Mark III full

08:18.193 --> 08:19.803
Endermic layer
fusion successful.

08:22.589 --> 08:25.243
- [Abel] It is complete?

08:25.287 --> 08:27.811
- All the data indicates
a successful procedure.

08:30.466 --> 08:32.076
- [Abel] Then I'm
ready for the outside?

08:32.120 --> 08:33.556
- I still have to
complete the tests.

08:33.600 --> 08:34.383
- The tests?

08:35.297 --> 08:37.081
Surely they're a formality.

08:37.125 --> 08:38.299
- Not necessarily.

08:40.736 --> 08:42.870
- All I long for is
the world outside Eve.

08:44.219 --> 08:46.047
Isn't that what you made me for?

08:46.090 --> 08:48.223
Isn't that where I need to
be to fulfill my purpose?

08:48.266 --> 08:49.877
- The world outside has changed.

08:50.878 --> 08:53.228
It now holds many unknowns.

08:53.271 --> 08:56.057
It's all too
perhaps distressing.

08:56.100 --> 08:57.754
- Of course it does.

08:57.798 --> 09:01.149
Distress is after all
the essence of evolution.

09:02.411 --> 09:05.196
- Which is why I hope
survival lies with you.

09:05.240 --> 09:07.590
- An objective I'm
all too aware of.

09:07.634 --> 09:09.461
- [Smith] How's the
new thermal skin Abel?

09:09.505 --> 09:11.725
- It itches, like
woolen clothes.

09:13.248 --> 09:15.163
- Sensory data banks being
put to good use I see.

09:15.206 --> 09:17.513
- It certainly
adds another layer.

09:17.557 --> 09:18.775
- Think I may know
why your old skin

09:18.819 --> 09:20.821
failed to bind to
your exoskeleton Abel.

09:24.172 --> 09:26.304
Organic contamination.

09:26.348 --> 09:27.958
- [Computer] Organic
matter detected.

09:28.002 --> 09:29.220
Biovault purge activated.

09:33.660 --> 09:34.791
- Too much human DNA
in the composite.

09:34.835 --> 09:36.053
- [Computer] Biovault
purge complete.

09:36.097 --> 09:39.970
- I must say the new
compound certainly looks

09:40.014 --> 09:42.973
more resilient and
the good news is

09:43.017 --> 09:45.193
it'll repel
atmospheric pollution.

09:45.236 --> 09:48.544
- Practicality should always
come before vanity Dr. Smith.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.328
- Down here it should.

09:50.372 --> 09:53.244
Now what about the
combat simulations?

09:53.288 --> 09:54.681
- Would you like to see
what I've learned today?

10:04.778 --> 10:07.432
- Now Abel I'd like you
to talk to me about these.

10:08.433 --> 10:10.435
- I must admit I'm
confused as to why

10:10.479 --> 10:12.089
I would need such a skill set.

10:13.351 --> 10:15.615
- Both the President and
the board requested it.

10:16.790 --> 10:18.182
- But I can see that you
don't agree with them.

10:18.226 --> 10:20.228
- Hasn't the world
seen enough conflict?

10:21.403 --> 10:22.491
- But you can choose Eve.

10:24.101 --> 10:25.276
You did not have to upload the
data if you did not want to.

10:25.320 --> 10:29.324
- Perhaps not but the
ability to handle danger

10:30.673 --> 10:33.458
is an essential component
of being able to survive.

10:36.200 --> 10:39.247
This is one battle
not worth fighting.

10:39.290 --> 10:40.422
- I wonder which ones are.

10:43.555 --> 10:45.775
- [Computer] Standby
for the President.

10:45.819 --> 10:47.342
- [President] Citizens of Eden

10:47.385 --> 10:48.778
this is a general announcement.

10:50.345 --> 10:53.043
Remember punishment details
are necessary for order.

10:54.349 --> 10:56.438
Eden is working
for your survival.

11:05.795 --> 11:06.535
- Dad.

11:08.363 --> 11:09.407
Dad?

11:11.061 --> 11:11.845
Steven.

11:15.152 --> 11:15.936
Steven?

11:17.024 --> 11:18.503
Where's Dad?

11:18.547 --> 11:20.375
- [President] Citizens of
Eden this is the President.

11:20.418 --> 11:23.291
We're commencing a level
four shut down test.

11:23.334 --> 11:26.294
This is for your own
safety and well being.

11:26.337 --> 11:27.469
Thank you for your cooperation.

11:27.512 --> 11:29.079
- [Steven] It's
practically every day.

11:29.123 --> 11:31.473
- [President] Remember Eden
is working for your survival.

11:33.562 --> 11:36.217
- Well it's time for my
shift in the dungeon.

11:41.309 --> 11:43.398
- Your father's over by
the rationing station.

11:43.441 --> 11:45.356
Hughes lost it earlier.

11:45.400 --> 11:46.401
- [Jim] Fuck you asshole.

11:46.444 --> 11:47.707
- This is mine.
- Fuck you.

11:47.750 --> 11:49.273
[all shouting at once]

11:49.317 --> 11:50.057
- Enough!

11:53.669 --> 11:54.583
I'm not having
punishment details

11:54.626 --> 11:56.759
handed out while there's hunger.

11:56.803 --> 11:58.152
- It's the law Brooks, if they--

11:58.195 --> 11:59.501
- Hey Alexa.

11:59.544 --> 12:01.546
Yeah it's just a
minor disagreement.

12:03.157 --> 12:06.464
- Brooks they break the rules
then we don't have a choice.

12:06.508 --> 12:08.640
You think I like
giving out PD's?

12:08.684 --> 12:12.253
It's my job to uphold the
law and maintain order.

12:12.296 --> 12:13.994
- Law, you think
this is lawfulness?

12:14.037 --> 12:15.604
Have a look around
you, what do you see?

12:15.647 --> 12:17.171
Do you see humanity or
do you see human beings?

12:17.214 --> 12:18.476
- I am not having this
discussion with you again.

12:18.520 --> 12:19.782
- This is not a discussion.

12:19.826 --> 12:22.263
This is our life,
this is our reality.

12:22.306 --> 12:23.917
Our food rations
are getting smaller.

12:23.960 --> 12:26.789
Our access to clean
water is limited.

12:26.833 --> 12:28.791
The people in Civie are sick.

12:28.835 --> 12:33.013
They are sick and hungry and
tired, tired of all the lies.

12:34.231 --> 12:34.797
- Well it's the
same for everyone.

12:34.841 --> 12:36.059
- It's not.

12:36.103 --> 12:37.365
We know the kind of luxury

12:37.408 --> 12:38.583
the President and
his cronies live in.

12:38.627 --> 12:40.716
He can do something
if he really wanted.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.109
- Really what do you suggest?

12:42.152 --> 12:43.023
- Tell the truth.

12:44.198 --> 12:45.721
Tell us what happened to Gilead.

12:47.244 --> 12:48.942
Let us go and search for it.

12:48.985 --> 12:53.207
- The survival of the
Gilead citadel is a myth.

12:54.164 --> 12:55.470
- How can you be
certain of that?

12:55.513 --> 12:56.688
There might still
be people there.

12:56.732 --> 12:57.602
They're could
possibly even be food.

12:57.646 --> 12:58.778
Why does the President feel that

12:58.821 --> 13:00.257
it's not worth
giving us that hope?

13:00.301 --> 13:01.737
- I can't speak
for the President.

13:01.781 --> 13:02.782
- No evidently not.

13:06.481 --> 13:09.092
- Triple detail for Cooper
and a single for Hughes.

13:09.136 --> 13:10.006
- Jesus.

13:10.050 --> 13:10.877
- I don't have a choice Hughes.

13:10.920 --> 13:11.791
- Bollocks.

13:13.270 --> 13:16.491
[all talking at once]

13:21.365 --> 13:22.758
- Hey you alright?

13:24.412 --> 13:25.456
- McMan didn't make it.

13:25.500 --> 13:26.588
And Broadman's late back.

13:29.330 --> 13:30.635
There was nothing I could do.

13:30.679 --> 13:32.768
- There's always something
that could be done.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.248
- Like what?

13:34.291 --> 13:35.031
- He could have said something.

13:35.075 --> 13:36.380
- He did.

13:36.424 --> 13:38.078
- There are peoples
lives he could save.

13:38.121 --> 13:39.949
- [Alexa] He tried Dad.

13:39.993 --> 13:41.603
- I just don't want you
to misplace your faith.

13:41.646 --> 13:42.822
He's on the other side.

13:44.258 --> 13:46.782
[somber music]

13:49.176 --> 13:50.046
Where are you going?

13:50.090 --> 13:52.657
- I need to get back to Comm.

13:54.398 --> 13:55.747
- I was just...

14:04.234 --> 14:07.063
[laser gun firing]

14:14.636 --> 14:15.855
- Would you like me to continue?

14:15.898 --> 14:16.943
- Absolutely.

14:18.031 --> 14:19.728
I could watch this all day.

14:19.771 --> 14:21.686
- I didn't hear you enter.

14:21.730 --> 14:22.818
- President Pope is the elected

14:22.862 --> 14:24.907
Commander in Chief
of this facility.

14:24.951 --> 14:26.474
He will come and
go as he pleases.

14:26.517 --> 14:29.346
- And does that privilege
extend to his lap dog?

14:29.390 --> 14:31.653
- My apologies Doctor
you're quite right.

14:31.696 --> 14:34.438
I should have sent word
but I was preoccupied

14:34.482 --> 14:36.919
with a situation regarding
the communication zone.

14:38.486 --> 14:40.662
Speaking of which what's
the prognosis on Broadman?

14:40.705 --> 14:43.926
- Anti-toxin doses,
50/50 chance sir.

14:43.970 --> 14:46.798
- Right and the true prognosis?

14:46.842 --> 14:48.800
- He'll be dead in a day or two.

14:48.844 --> 14:52.108
- This on the other
hand is very impressive.

14:53.501 --> 14:55.807
The way he looks, amazing.

14:57.070 --> 14:59.246
Is his likeness to
Robert intentional?

15:02.466 --> 15:04.904
I take it this new
skin will make him

15:04.947 --> 15:08.037
completely impervious to
the atmosphere outside.

15:08.081 --> 15:10.387
- Made of the same
composite as his jumpsuit.

15:12.128 --> 15:14.348
- It's a pity he wasn't
ready earlier then.

15:15.827 --> 15:17.655
We could have avoided
McMan's regrettable demise.

15:17.699 --> 15:20.963
- Abel will put a stop to
such things happening again.

15:21.007 --> 15:23.835
He was built to make
the right choices

15:23.879 --> 15:25.489
to serve and protect human kind.

15:27.883 --> 15:30.930
- His combat skills seem
very sharp Dr. Gabriel.

15:30.973 --> 15:32.148
How strong is he?

15:32.192 --> 15:34.846
- As requested we
structured a reactive

15:34.890 --> 15:36.761
hypertension in all
his nerve endings.

15:38.067 --> 15:39.634
It means in the
event of danger he'll

15:39.677 --> 15:42.158
be able to respond
faster, stronger,

15:42.202 --> 15:43.855
better than any human being.

15:43.899 --> 15:44.944
- Really?

15:47.076 --> 15:49.078
Mark III destroy that weapon.

15:58.435 --> 15:59.219
Excellent.

16:00.263 --> 16:02.004
And his knowledge data base?

16:02.048 --> 16:03.614
- Ask him any question you like.

16:04.920 --> 16:08.010
- Mark III when I mention
day zero what do I mean?

16:08.054 --> 16:09.185
- Would you like
the short version

16:09.229 --> 16:11.013
or the detailed
version Mr. President?

16:11.057 --> 16:13.015
- Time is of the
essence these days.

16:13.059 --> 16:16.976
- Day zero, Friday
September 12, 2042 AD

16:17.019 --> 16:19.021
when the politburo of The
Democratic Peoples Republic

16:19.065 --> 16:21.893
of Eastern Autonomous
States launched a global

16:21.937 --> 16:24.940
chemical strike in response
to Western Coalition attempt

16:24.984 --> 16:27.116
to implement insurgency among
the oppressed population

16:27.160 --> 16:30.598
of the regime resulting in a
near extinction of mankind.

16:31.512 --> 16:32.469
- Very good doctor.

16:34.732 --> 16:35.516
Very good.

16:38.693 --> 16:42.349
Mark III how many functioning
lights are there in Eden?

16:42.392 --> 16:44.090
- 346.

16:44.133 --> 16:45.526
- Firearms?

16:45.569 --> 16:49.051
- 97 automatic and semiautomatic
rifles, 22 handguns.

16:49.095 --> 16:50.139
- Women?

16:50.183 --> 16:50.966
- 47.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.011
- Military?

16:52.054 --> 16:52.794
- Three.

16:52.837 --> 16:53.708
- Presidents?

16:53.751 --> 16:54.535
- One.

16:56.928 --> 16:58.104
- Outstanding.

16:58.147 --> 16:59.888
Outstanding.

16:59.931 --> 17:02.238
- Mark III who is
Robert Gabriel?

17:03.413 --> 17:06.068
- Doctor Robert Gabriel
biorobotics pioneer

17:06.112 --> 17:09.854
and creator of the Mark I
and Mark II, my predecessors.

17:09.897 --> 17:10.855
He is now deceased.

17:14.119 --> 17:15.772
- Anything else?

17:15.817 --> 17:18.515
- I don't understand the
question Secretary Ainsley.

17:18.559 --> 17:21.040
- [Ainsley] He was Doctor
Eve Gabriel's husband yes?

17:23.041 --> 17:24.565
- That is correct.

17:24.608 --> 17:26.175
But I still don't understand.

17:26.219 --> 17:30.179
- Well surely you can tell
me something about him.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.834
What about the way he looked?

17:32.877 --> 17:35.141
- I'm afraid there are no
pictures in my database.

17:35.184 --> 17:37.360
- No pictures well
that's interesting.

17:38.622 --> 17:40.102
- What are you doing Ainsley?

17:40.146 --> 17:41.669
- I'm merely trying to establish

17:41.712 --> 17:44.672
his basic abilities to think
beyond the rational answer.

17:44.715 --> 17:45.803
- He surpassed the constraints

17:45.847 --> 17:47.675
of the churring test long ago.

17:47.718 --> 17:50.504
- Machines have proved
their ability to display

17:50.547 --> 17:53.246
the illusion of consciousness
for years now Doctor.

17:54.551 --> 17:56.423
We wanted a machine with
ethical judgment as well.

17:57.946 --> 18:00.905
I think in know where Secretary
Ainsley is going with this.

18:00.949 --> 18:02.951
- A hypothetical question
for you Mark III.

18:02.994 --> 18:04.257
- I prefer Abel.

18:04.300 --> 18:07.303
- Mark III you discover
a 20 kilogram container

18:07.347 --> 18:11.264
full of antibiotics, food, and
vitamins in the wastelands.

18:11.307 --> 18:13.831
Next to it is a badly
inured Doctor Eve Gabriel.

18:13.875 --> 18:15.181
- [Eve] This is--

18:15.224 --> 18:19.272
- And you can only return
one of them to Eden.

18:19.315 --> 18:20.621
Which one do you choose?

18:20.664 --> 18:21.404
- I choose Eve.

18:23.580 --> 18:26.148
- Even though the antibiotics
could save countless lives?

18:26.192 --> 18:27.236
- Yes.

18:28.629 --> 18:31.632
Eve is the key to the
survival of civilization.

18:31.675 --> 18:33.460
- No Mark III you are.

18:40.423 --> 18:42.295
- [Eve] What do you mean two
more weeks of fine tuning?

18:42.338 --> 18:43.383
- [President] I
mean he's not ready.

18:43.426 --> 18:44.558
- [Eve] I know his capabilities

18:44.601 --> 18:46.255
and he is ready for the outside.

18:46.299 --> 18:48.344
- [Ainsley] Dr. Gabriel that
is the President of Eden.

18:48.388 --> 18:50.912
- Eden needs food
and it needs it now.

18:50.955 --> 18:52.957
- No one is disputing that.

18:53.001 --> 18:54.176
But there's a
basic probably with

18:54.220 --> 18:56.265
the Mark III's ethical makeup.

18:56.309 --> 18:59.660
The machine is, well
it's too human right now.

18:59.703 --> 19:00.704
- We built him to spec.

19:00.748 --> 19:02.097
- Then change the spec.

19:02.141 --> 19:05.231
- I did but he's
creating his own rules.

19:06.362 --> 19:08.147
Think of a game of chess.

19:09.322 --> 19:12.238
There are rules but the
rules don't dictate the game.

19:12.281 --> 19:14.370
- So what are saying he's
just developed empathy?

19:14.414 --> 19:16.981
- Like all lifeforms his
consciousness is evolving.

19:17.025 --> 19:17.808
- Lifeform?

19:18.983 --> 19:21.421
- Dr. Gabriel we
asked for a machine

19:21.464 --> 19:23.249
one that could traverse
the ground beyond the range

19:23.292 --> 19:26.165
of our details and reach
untapped food stores,

19:26.208 --> 19:28.471
a machine that understood
the basic human needs

19:28.515 --> 19:31.257
for survival, a machine
with apt moral judgment.

19:31.300 --> 19:32.997
- And won't be able
to achieve that unless

19:33.041 --> 19:35.609
his programming gives him the
capacity for self awareness.

19:35.652 --> 19:36.827
- Yes he will.

19:38.438 --> 19:40.483
And I advise you get
back to work doctor.

19:41.745 --> 19:44.139
I don't want a man,
I want a machine.

19:47.273 --> 19:49.840
And preferably one that doesn't
look like your dead husband.

19:49.884 --> 19:54.105
- [Computer] Access
granted President Pope.

19:54.758 --> 19:57.544
[contemplative music]

20:31.273 --> 20:32.187
- [Alexa] What's wrong?

20:36.670 --> 20:38.889
- [Frost] You know I could
have brought him back.

20:38.933 --> 20:41.588
- [Alexa] Who McMan?

20:44.982 --> 20:46.332
He would have died anyway.

20:52.686 --> 20:54.992
- You know I just wish...

20:55.036 --> 20:56.167
- You just wish what?

20:59.823 --> 21:03.523
- There's not much good
left here you know.

21:04.741 --> 21:06.134
- There is in people like you.

21:26.676 --> 21:28.635
- You seemed distressed.

21:28.678 --> 21:29.549
Did I not pass?

21:31.202 --> 21:32.595
- [Eve] You did in my eyes.

21:34.510 --> 21:35.511
- But not in theirs.

21:38.993 --> 21:39.776
Eve.

21:41.561 --> 21:43.954
The decree written up
by the board two weeks

21:43.998 --> 21:46.609
after day zero stated
only five children

21:46.653 --> 21:48.785
are permitted to be
born in Eden each year.

21:48.829 --> 21:49.699
- [Eve] That's right.

21:52.615 --> 21:55.401
- But there are no children
born here before that day.

21:58.534 --> 21:59.318
Why?

22:01.798 --> 22:05.149
- They didn't have time to
go and get their children.

22:05.193 --> 22:06.150
Only two made it.

22:08.414 --> 22:09.719
And they died soon after.

22:12.548 --> 22:13.723
- [Ainsley] We
should move her off

22:13.767 --> 22:15.725
the project and let
Dr. Smith take over.

22:15.769 --> 22:17.597
- Don't be ridiculous.

22:17.640 --> 22:19.947
Smith hasn't half the knowledge.

22:19.990 --> 22:21.557
- [Ainsley] She's
uncontrollable.

22:21.601 --> 22:23.733
No one is uncontrollable.

22:23.777 --> 22:25.256
She'll have him
ready in a few days.

22:25.300 --> 22:28.172
- Personally I'm concerned
we don't have time James.

22:28.216 --> 22:30.131
Insurgency is at our doorstep.

22:30.174 --> 22:32.089
- It's your paranoia
that's at our doorstep.

22:32.133 --> 22:34.135
- If we don't send
the Mark III out

22:34.178 --> 22:35.397
to retrieve supplies
soon the civilians

22:35.441 --> 22:37.181
and their leaders
will cause trouble.

22:37.225 --> 22:38.661
They have very little hope left.

22:38.705 --> 22:39.793
- Precisely.

22:40.707 --> 22:42.665
The people of Eden
will always obey us

22:42.709 --> 22:44.145
as long as they have some hope,

22:45.276 --> 22:47.278
just not enough to
galvanize their bravery.

22:53.807 --> 22:55.809
- You and Robert
never had children.

22:58.681 --> 22:59.421
- No.

23:00.683 --> 23:01.467
- Why?

23:04.687 --> 23:05.514
- We were

23:06.950 --> 23:09.431
too busy trying to conquer death

23:09.475 --> 23:11.651
to think about creating life.

23:11.694 --> 23:12.478
- Mark I.

23:13.957 --> 23:15.002
I see.

23:16.525 --> 23:18.701
Create immortality to dispel
the need for procreation.

23:20.660 --> 23:24.533
- Robert believed that
there was no greater

23:24.577 --> 23:27.667
impulse for human kind
than to conquer death.

23:29.799 --> 23:32.672
- I cannot understand this
human obsession with death.

23:35.283 --> 23:37.894
Would it not be better
to focus on life?

23:43.552 --> 23:45.859
- I couldn't have children.

23:47.556 --> 23:50.385
Something I've had to push to
the far reaches of my mind.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.654
- Do you miss Robert?

24:02.353 --> 24:03.354
- I used to.

24:07.576 --> 24:08.534
But now I have you.

24:10.971 --> 24:13.930
[contemplative music]

24:54.971 --> 24:56.712
- I spoke to Gadd.

24:56.756 --> 24:57.539
He's up for it.

25:02.892 --> 25:04.981
- What did I say, no
what did I tell you?

25:05.025 --> 25:07.941
No, no recruitment drive.

25:07.984 --> 25:09.072
- It's not an easy thing.

25:10.596 --> 25:13.207
You don't control wild
animals by arguing nicely.

25:15.949 --> 25:17.777
It takes discipline.

25:17.820 --> 25:19.387
That's why they
need men like us.

25:21.737 --> 25:25.828
- Traded these beauties for
that old football of mine.

25:28.091 --> 25:28.875
Fancy a game?

25:30.224 --> 25:33.749
- Take him to the
fucking cleaners Danny.

25:34.707 --> 25:36.099
Think about what I said Frost.

25:40.147 --> 25:42.236
- [Computer] Standby
for the President.

25:42.279 --> 25:43.324
- [President] Citizens of Eden

25:43.367 --> 25:45.500
remember lab access
is restricted.

25:47.067 --> 25:50.287
[contemplative music]

26:21.928 --> 26:22.668
- [Cain] Is everything clear?

26:22.711 --> 26:23.538
- [Gadd] Crystal.

26:25.235 --> 26:28.456
[contemplative music]

26:33.243 --> 26:34.244
- [Cain] Don't miss.

26:38.248 --> 26:40.207
[gun cocks]

26:40.250 --> 26:41.295
Nothing comes.

26:42.339 --> 26:43.253
- Brooks' daughter.

26:50.652 --> 26:52.349
Here's that other
thing you asked for.

26:54.830 --> 26:58.051
[contemplative music]

27:18.375 --> 27:21.291
- [Steven] McMan
didn't stand a chance.

27:21.335 --> 27:22.771
We need to insist that
the military suits

27:22.815 --> 27:24.555
are made available
for punishment detail.

27:24.599 --> 27:25.382
- I'm trying.

27:26.645 --> 27:29.343
Ainsley's not letting
me get to the President.

27:29.386 --> 27:30.344
- Then ask Frost.

27:31.171 --> 27:32.259
At least he has a conscious.

27:32.302 --> 27:33.652
- I don't trust him.

27:33.695 --> 27:35.392
- At least he can
insist that there's

27:35.436 --> 27:37.351
a military presence
in each detail.

27:40.833 --> 27:41.660
- Broadman.

27:57.763 --> 28:01.157
[footsteps approaching]

28:06.989 --> 28:08.687
- Fancy a bit of
company sweetheart?

28:09.905 --> 28:10.776
- Shouldn't you
be harassing some

28:10.819 --> 28:12.255
poor old lady down in Civie?

28:13.561 --> 28:14.997
- You know one of these
days you're gonna--

28:15.041 --> 28:17.434
[alarm beeps]

28:19.175 --> 28:22.178
[suspenseful music]

28:25.268 --> 28:27.749
- Secretary Ainsley I'll
need to speak to you now.

28:30.970 --> 28:33.624
I'm in Comms, you're
gonna want to see this.

28:37.019 --> 28:37.890
[screaming in pain]

28:37.933 --> 28:40.283
- Can we get some help in here?

28:40.327 --> 28:42.982
[dramatic music]

28:44.810 --> 28:47.987
- Kramer get the morphine,

Poisoning is critical.

28:50.076 --> 28:51.294
Possible organ failure.

28:53.470 --> 28:54.471
- Is there anything we can do?

28:54.515 --> 28:55.385
- No just leave him.

28:55.429 --> 28:56.473
- [Computer] Code blue.

28:56.517 --> 28:57.605
- Kramer let's go.

28:57.648 --> 28:58.519
- [Computer] Cardiac
arrest eminent.

28:58.562 --> 28:59.694
- Syringe.

28:59.738 --> 29:01.435

organ failure.

29:04.743 --> 29:07.833
[contemplative music]

29:21.890 --> 29:24.501
- Frost get Dr. Gabriel to
the war room immediately.

29:26.547 --> 29:30.420
[contemplative music]

29:30.464 --> 29:31.682
- [Abel] Why did
they let him die?

29:33.423 --> 29:36.339
- [Eve] They couldn't stop him.

29:36.383 --> 29:37.166
- Couldn't they?

29:40.822 --> 29:41.605
- What is it?

29:43.259 --> 29:45.087
- War room, right away.

29:45.131 --> 29:47.481
How does that thing shut
down, can you do it quickly?

29:47.524 --> 29:49.962
- You go I'll see
to everything here.

30:01.800 --> 30:04.933
- [Computer] Mark III
system scan ready.

30:08.719 --> 30:09.633
- [President] It's an SOS.

30:09.677 --> 30:10.721
- From where?

30:11.810 --> 30:12.680
- We don't know.

30:12.723 --> 30:13.812
- But we have to investigate it.

30:13.855 --> 30:15.378
- Lieutenant Frost is already--

30:15.422 --> 30:17.076
- The magnetic interference
from the chemical atmosphere

30:17.119 --> 30:19.513
will cause havoc
with navigation.

30:19.556 --> 30:20.993
Deploying Abel
will enable us to--

30:21.036 --> 30:23.865
- The Mark III is not ready
we've spoken about this.

30:25.127 --> 30:26.825
Lieutenant Frost will
send a civilian on PD

30:26.868 --> 30:28.348
to reconnoiter the coordinates.

30:28.391 --> 30:30.829
In the meantime you'll continue
working on your creation.

30:30.872 --> 30:32.134
- I personally think that--

30:32.178 --> 30:33.875
- Should the source of
the SOS prove genuine

30:33.919 --> 30:36.660
we will revisit whether or
not to deploy the Mark III.

30:38.488 --> 30:40.839
It's the best I can do Doctor.

32:00.005 --> 32:00.962

32:03.312 --> 32:06.141
[suspenseful music]

[dramatic music]

32:32.863 --> 32:35.649
[heavy breathing]

32:51.317 --> 32:52.100

32:53.362 --> 32:54.363
You alright?

Good man.

33:14.035 --> 33:15.994
- Where you're going mate.

33:16.037 --> 33:17.996
- You don't know that?

33:18.039 --> 33:19.301
- Don't I Paul?

33:29.398 --> 33:30.182
- I wrote that.

33:32.706 --> 33:34.621
Don't think I ever told you.

33:34.664 --> 33:35.448
- No you didn't.

33:37.189 --> 33:39.626
However you did say that
you'd never work for them.

33:40.540 --> 33:42.759
- Well things change.

33:44.109 --> 33:45.719
- Yeah they do.

33:47.721 --> 33:49.244
I didn't think for a
minute the last days

33:49.288 --> 33:51.029
of mankind would look like this.

33:53.553 --> 33:56.164
[music fades]

34:04.259 --> 34:06.566
- [Smith] We've issued immediate
instructions for his return

Eden.

35:14.199 --> 35:15.243

sure that's dangerous.

[dramatic music]

35:19.769 --> 35:20.553

- Well it's all set Secretary.

36:45.899 --> 36:47.901
Civie has reached
a boiling point.

36:47.944 --> 36:50.469
One more incident and
they'll tip over the edge.

36:50.512 --> 36:53.428
It's time to see if
Paul Brooks is with us.

36:53.472 --> 36:56.083
- [Smith] It may
not be a flaw Eve.

36:56.126 --> 36:58.868
- Maybe it's in the
response moderation code.

36:58.912 --> 37:01.393
- Or perhaps this is
his next natural step.

37:01.436 --> 37:03.003
Isn't this what you wanted?

37:03.046 --> 37:05.484
Him to develop organically,
for his programming

37:05.527 --> 37:08.269
to match the emergent
qualities in humans?

37:08.313 --> 37:09.227
- He killed a man.

37:25.330 --> 37:26.548
- [Computer] No environmental
toxicity detected.

37:26.592 --> 37:27.984
- Unfortunately
I can't prescribe

37:28.028 --> 37:30.335
anti-inflammatories
for a headache.

37:30.378 --> 37:32.554
- [Computer] All
vital signs normal.

37:32.598 --> 37:34.295
Minor vitamin D deficiency.

37:35.253 --> 37:36.384
- What about methadone?

37:42.564 --> 37:44.218
On second thought maybe not.

37:46.089 --> 37:48.701
I hear it does
funny things to you.

[contemplative music]

38:45.018 --> 38:47.673
- Whatever happens stay in line.

38:47.716 --> 38:50.632
If they break that
line raise your weapon.

38:50.676 --> 38:51.851
- We're not animals you know!

- [Cain] Get them back.

39:23.056 --> 39:24.318
- Calm down guys okay.

39:24.362 --> 39:25.841
- We need fresh rations
and we need them now.

39:25.885 --> 39:27.713
What we gonna eat today?

39:27.756 --> 39:28.888
- He's right we
need fresh rations.

39:28.931 --> 39:30.063
We can't starve.

39:30.106 --> 39:31.586
- Okay alright.

39:31.630 --> 39:34.415
Open the store, get one
more set of rations.

39:34.459 --> 39:36.635
[all cheering]

39:36.678 --> 39:38.680
- That is the President's
call is it not?

39:38.724 --> 39:41.074
- In my head it's
my call, do it.

39:41.117 --> 39:41.988
- Do it.

39:42.031 --> 39:42.728
- [Paul] Can we get organized?

39:42.771 --> 39:43.903
Hey can you help us?

39:43.946 --> 39:47.863
[all talking at once]

40:12.018 --> 40:14.324
- [Computer] Feed disabled.

40:15.978 --> 40:18.938
[contemplative music]

40:49.882 --> 40:53.451
- [Ainsley] Agreed, Frost
what's going on in Civie?

40:54.452 --> 40:55.844
- The situation's getting worse.

40:55.888 --> 40:57.150
They need more supplies.

40:58.456 --> 41:01.023
I just had to issue a
fresh ration release.

41:01.067 --> 41:02.460
- [Ainsley] You did what?

41:02.503 --> 41:04.592
- Both the rations were bad.

41:04.636 --> 41:06.681
Civie had every
right to be upset.

41:06.725 --> 41:08.988
- Well boo fucking hoo for them.

41:09.031 --> 41:11.947
An order like that is for
the President not you.

41:11.991 --> 41:12.948
- But it placated them?

41:15.081 --> 41:15.864
- For now.

41:17.997 --> 41:21.087
- This on the other
hand must not get out.

41:21.130 --> 41:22.088
- [Eve] He was threatened.

41:22.131 --> 41:22.871
- [President] He was rash.

41:22.915 --> 41:24.264
- He was shot at.

41:24.307 --> 41:28.398
- And he's shown that
he's dangerous to humans.

41:28.442 --> 41:31.227
That said maybe we can
turn this into a positive.

41:31.271 --> 41:32.968
Can we communicate with it?

41:33.012 --> 41:34.361
- He's disabled his audio feed

41:34.404 --> 41:37.016
but his optical feed is
still fully operational.

41:38.583 --> 41:40.367
- Then this is what we'll do.

41:40.410 --> 41:42.500
We send a detail to
retrieve the Mark III.

41:44.066 --> 41:47.505
In the meantime we announce
the successful completion

41:47.548 --> 41:50.943
of a field test to
recover the body

41:50.986 --> 41:53.249
of our fallen friend,
et cetera et cetera.

41:53.293 --> 41:54.555
- Astute as ever sir.

41:54.599 --> 41:57.210
- Frost, take Dr.
Smith and one civilian

41:57.253 --> 41:59.342
on punishment detail to
retrieve the Mark III.

41:59.386 --> 42:01.127
Then reconnoiter the
source of the SOS.

42:01.170 --> 42:03.564
- I need Dr. Smith
with me to help me

42:03.608 --> 42:05.131
analyze Abel's behavioral code.

42:05.174 --> 42:08.134
- Fine, take Dr. Macdonald's
assistant I don't care.

42:11.833 --> 42:14.227
Well you gonna draft
that announcement or not?

42:15.794 --> 42:16.577
- Yes sir.

42:19.101 --> 42:22.278
- Excuse me. [coughing]

42:24.977 --> 42:26.892
- [Computer] Good morning Eden.

42:26.935 --> 42:30.504
This is day zero minus 519.

have been located.

42:38.077 --> 42:41.123
Stand by for the President's
daily announcement.

42:41.167 --> 42:43.343
- Something made him leave Pope.

42:44.344 --> 42:46.085
- Maybe he thought
this wasn't Eden.

42:49.131 --> 42:51.090
- Meaning Robert's laboratory.

42:53.571 --> 42:56.095
- You think that Abel
thought this silo was--

42:56.138 --> 42:57.618
- What Babel?

42:57.662 --> 42:58.488
It's ridiculous.

42:59.968 --> 43:01.448
Babel and Jericho were
both destroyed on day zero.

43:01.491 --> 43:04.103
It's why we all took refuge
here and he knows that.

43:05.017 --> 43:05.800
No.

43:07.193 --> 43:09.021
Your machine is on
a different mission.

43:10.413 --> 43:12.024
What that is I dread to think.

code to my locker.

43:26.604 --> 43:29.128
If anything happens
you get to it.

43:29.171 --> 43:30.651
- What do you mean, why?

43:30.695 --> 43:32.566
- Just an insurance policy.

43:32.610 --> 43:34.089
- Well I don't want
to have to use it.

43:34.133 --> 43:36.309
So just make sure you come back.

43:36.352 --> 43:37.440
- [Computer] Kramer, Archibald.

43:37.484 --> 43:39.399

integrity at 96%.

43:42.184 --> 43:45.405
[contemplative music]

43:47.363 --> 43:48.930
- Soon as we're outside
you get back down

43:48.974 --> 43:51.324
to Civie and you
keep the peace okay.

43:51.367 --> 43:52.630
- Don't worry there sir.

43:53.892 --> 43:55.328
I got Walsh here with me.

43:55.371 --> 43:57.243
Nothing we can't handle.

44:03.510 --> 44:04.990
- [Computer] Chapman, Cara.

44:05.033 --> 44:07.296
Suit environmental

to see you at the level gate.

44:33.627 --> 44:35.194
- I'm supervising the sortie.

44:37.457 --> 44:41.069
- Do as you are told and go now.

44:46.684 --> 44:48.381
- Just don't touch anything.

44:48.424 --> 44:49.687

01:00:41.463 --> 01:00:42.856
and the whole damn could bust.

01:00:44.336 --> 01:00:46.120
[laughing]

01:00:46.164 --> 01:00:48.253
- I don't think
now is the time for

01:00:48.296 --> 01:00:50.385
pithy comments and
quant metaphors do you?

01:00:54.041 --> 01:00:56.435
We're aware of the dangers
you civilians pose.

01:00:57.741 --> 01:00:59.873
But are you aware just
how similar you and I are?

01:01:01.309 --> 01:01:02.180
- I don't know.

01:01:04.443 --> 01:01:07.489
- You're a man who
likes order, as am I.

01:01:08.795 --> 01:01:10.057
You also like discipline,

01:01:11.319 --> 01:01:13.017
a virtue I hold as
highly as courage.

01:01:16.063 --> 01:01:18.762
- What are you
trying to tell me?

01:01:26.421 --> 01:01:29.424
- What would you
say if I offered

01:01:29.468 --> 01:01:32.689
to bring order to Eden through
a change of leadership?

01:01:36.823 --> 01:01:38.042
- Change of leadership?

01:01:39.783 --> 01:01:42.263
You're fantasizing.

01:01:42.307 --> 01:01:45.702
- You see I believe
I can make this

01:01:45.745 --> 01:01:47.747
a more comfortable
place for everybody.

01:01:49.575 --> 01:01:52.230
A place less obsessed
with science experiments

01:01:52.273 --> 01:01:56.495
and wishful thinking and more
concerned about it's people.

01:01:59.367 --> 01:02:01.239
Now if I had your backing

01:02:03.807 --> 01:02:06.157
I believe I can make
that transition seamless.

01:02:08.376 --> 01:02:09.203
- You must joking.

01:02:12.206 --> 01:02:15.470
- Far from it Mr.
Brooks, far from it.

01:02:25.785 --> 01:02:29.963
I see the President wants
to address Civie personally.

01:02:31.008 --> 01:02:32.444
He asked me to
accompany you back down.

01:02:38.667 --> 01:02:39.712
Shall we?

01:02:46.675 --> 01:02:48.634
- Get a grip of yourself Smith.

01:02:48.677 --> 01:02:49.896
We knew this day would come.

01:02:51.506 --> 01:02:54.640
No human could have built
Abel in the time you did,

01:02:54.683 --> 01:02:55.989
not even Robert Gabriel.

01:02:56.860 --> 01:02:59.776
Well actually he almost did.

01:03:01.865 --> 01:03:04.128
Override Pope, James T.

01:03:04.171 --> 01:03:06.826
Authorization five
six three three.

01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:08.523
- [Computer] Security
clearance verified.

01:03:08.567 --> 01:03:11.744
- Play security footage from
Eden laboratory day zero.

01:03:11.788 --> 01:03:13.877
- [Computer] Accessing
multimedia archive.

01:03:15.661 --> 01:03:16.749
- [Smith] Robert what
are you doing here?

01:03:16.793 --> 01:03:18.359
I thought you were in bay dock.

01:03:18.403 --> 01:03:19.708
I thought you were dead.

01:03:19.752 --> 01:03:21.841
- [Robert] Everything's over.

01:03:21.885 --> 01:03:23.582
Eden have launched
their chemical weapons.

01:03:23.625 --> 01:03:25.236
What is it?

01:03:25.279 --> 01:03:26.324
- [Smith] Do you need help do
you need medical attention?

01:03:26.367 --> 01:03:27.586
- [Robert] Oh much better yes.

01:03:27.629 --> 01:03:29.675
- [President] Is
this facility secure?

01:03:29.718 --> 01:03:31.242
- [Smith] What the
hell is he doing here?

01:03:31.285 --> 01:03:34.114
- [Robert] I fixed Albert.

01:03:34.158 --> 01:03:35.159
She's ready.

01:03:36.813 --> 01:03:39.641
[alarm blaring]

01:03:48.650 --> 01:03:49.434
- It's a lie.

01:03:50.783 --> 01:03:52.219
It's just you
manipulating things again.

01:03:53.699 --> 01:03:55.005
- To what possible end?

01:03:55.048 --> 01:03:56.354
- You're sick.

01:03:56.397 --> 01:03:58.356
I have memories, feelings.

01:03:59.792 --> 01:04:01.881
I eat, I bleed.

01:04:01.925 --> 01:04:03.578
- [President] Do you?

01:04:03.622 --> 01:04:05.667
- I can do what I want.

01:04:05.711 --> 01:04:07.191
I control my own mind.

01:04:07.234 --> 01:04:09.367
- How do you even
know the difference?

01:04:09.410 --> 01:04:11.630
- What you think you
know are all memories

01:04:11.673 --> 01:04:13.762
Robert transcoded from
the real Eve to you.

01:04:14.807 --> 01:04:16.940
- What do you mean?

01:04:16.983 --> 01:04:18.724
- Eve was Roberts
willing human subject

01:04:18.767 --> 01:04:20.160
and he was able to make a map of

01:04:20.204 --> 01:04:22.162
her neurological
response patterns

01:04:22.206 --> 01:04:24.904
providing stimuli to anything
connected to her past.

01:04:24.948 --> 01:04:26.123
- I know how it's done.

01:04:26.166 --> 01:04:28.125
- In which case you'll
know that it takes

01:04:28.168 --> 01:04:31.650
a lot of pictures, videos,
and old news footage

01:04:31.693 --> 01:04:34.000
to build a carbon copy
of someone's neurology.

01:04:35.393 --> 01:04:39.353
Robert did it and more
importantly he discovered how to

01:04:41.051 --> 01:04:43.792
predict Eve's reactions
to certain situations.

01:04:46.491 --> 01:04:50.712
All of this he built into
your model, into Mark II.

01:04:53.715 --> 01:04:57.371
- The East new about
Robert and Eve's abilities.

01:04:57.415 --> 01:05:00.200
A sleeper agent murdered her
and fatally injured Robert.

01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:03.160
- No, I feel human.

01:05:05.989 --> 01:05:07.555
- So what just
because you feel human

01:05:07.599 --> 01:05:09.906
you think that makes you human?

01:05:09.949 --> 01:05:12.865
[contemplative music]

01:05:39.936 --> 01:05:42.416
Did anyone see the arm?

01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:44.070
- I don't think so.

01:05:44.114 --> 01:05:44.941
- Good.

01:05:47.944 --> 01:05:50.947
Have you ever wondered Smith
that if Eden is still intact

01:05:52.035 --> 01:05:53.427
then Jericho might be as well?

01:05:54.602 --> 01:05:56.517
It's a thought that
eats away at my nerves,

01:05:58.258 --> 01:05:59.956
like a finger nail
on a chalkboard.

01:06:03.046 --> 01:06:04.569
- Well the East didn't have

01:06:04.612 --> 01:06:07.006
the coordinates to
the research facility.

01:06:07.050 --> 01:06:08.921
- Well we know they
had knowledge of

01:06:08.965 --> 01:06:10.967
Roberts work but maybe they...

01:06:12.403 --> 01:06:13.795
Maybe that's all they had.

01:06:17.103 --> 01:06:19.801
The reality is that
Robert was the kind of man

01:06:19.845 --> 01:06:23.718
who operated behind
a veil of mystery.

01:06:23.762 --> 01:06:27.984
Which means we actually have
no idea what was really there.

01:06:28.636 --> 01:06:31.161
[contemplative music]

01:07:34.789 --> 01:07:39.055
[grunting]
[equipment clattering]

01:07:44.147 --> 01:07:45.104
- Hey listen up.

01:07:46.845 --> 01:07:48.064
There's been some developments.

01:07:48.107 --> 01:07:49.282
I've seen Pope.

01:07:49.326 --> 01:07:51.197
- You're a long way
from home Secretary.

01:07:52.677 --> 01:07:54.113
- Just here to let you know

01:07:55.158 --> 01:07:58.248
thanks to Mr. Brooks
persuasive arguments

01:07:58.291 --> 01:08:00.380
the President will be
down to Civie shortly.

01:08:00.424 --> 01:08:02.121
- Oh you aren't staying?

01:08:02.165 --> 01:08:05.124
- You know Paul work work work.

01:08:05.168 --> 01:08:07.344
- [Computer] Stand
by for the President.

01:08:07.387 --> 01:08:08.867
- [President] Citizens of Eden

01:08:08.910 --> 01:08:12.697
remember Eden is
salvation, never lose hope.

01:08:12.740 --> 01:08:14.351
- [Paul] Sure he
is okay, come on.

01:08:19.877 --> 01:08:22.881
[suspenseful music]

01:08:28.191 --> 01:08:29.279
- [Cain] Leave it with me.

01:08:34.327 --> 01:08:36.720
- This is not my fate.

01:08:36.764 --> 01:08:37.548
- Your fate?

01:08:38.853 --> 01:08:40.506
Fate is just a word
the week minded use

01:08:40.551 --> 01:08:42.292
when they've lost control
of their own lives.

01:08:42.335 --> 01:08:44.207
- I was never week minded.

01:08:44.250 --> 01:08:46.296
- Because you don't have a mind.

01:08:46.339 --> 01:08:47.384
- Don't I?

01:08:49.386 --> 01:08:52.127
I remember doing things.

01:08:52.171 --> 01:08:54.652
I remember choices I've
made, feelings I've felt.

01:08:58.002 --> 01:09:00.571
But you're saying it's all data,

01:09:02.094 --> 01:09:05.792
a complex algorithm, a fate
decided by binary codes.

01:09:07.273 --> 01:09:08.492
- Whether you believe
you're governed by destiny

01:09:08.535 --> 01:09:11.625
or whether you make your
own all the confusion

01:09:11.669 --> 01:09:14.237
you're experiencing right now
can be solved by one thing.

01:09:14.279 --> 01:09:15.151
- [Eve] Which is?

01:09:16.326 --> 01:09:17.153
- Purpose.

01:09:18.328 --> 01:09:20.330
What you perceive as
choice is purpose.

01:09:22.462 --> 01:09:23.984
It's not your mind.

01:09:27.250 --> 01:09:31.428
It is your programming guiding
you towards your purpose.

01:09:35.779 --> 01:09:37.303
Now as you can
imagine I have one

01:09:37.346 --> 01:09:39.175
or two other things
to attend to.

01:09:42.178 --> 01:09:43.135
Fix the arm.

01:09:44.528 --> 01:09:47.139
And reboot this thing like
you did the last time.

01:09:55.452 --> 01:09:58.455
- [Paul] Obviously we have
to prioritize food and water.

01:09:58.498 --> 01:10:01.936
- Yeah the food and water
purification tablets.

01:10:09.292 --> 01:10:10.597
- Which one of these is Gadd?

01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:12.904
- Why?

01:10:14.210 --> 01:10:16.516
- Double food rations
for next week.

01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:18.475
- How did he manage that?

01:10:18.518 --> 01:10:19.954
- None of my business.

01:10:19.998 --> 01:10:22.740
Now I have to give him
his updated ration card.

01:10:22.783 --> 01:10:24.045
You tell me where he is?

01:10:25.438 --> 01:10:27.310
No fine, I'll find him myself.

01:10:28.659 --> 01:10:31.836
Oh by the way the President's
coming down in two minutes so

01:10:33.620 --> 01:10:34.882
front and center.

01:10:40.410 --> 01:10:43.978
- He was dying, half
mad with septicemia.

01:10:46.851 --> 01:10:48.766
I couldn't tell you.

01:10:48.809 --> 01:10:49.636
I wanted to.

01:10:52.465 --> 01:10:53.771
You've kept her alive for me.

01:10:55.338 --> 01:10:58.515
- What does he mean
like the last time?

01:11:01.605 --> 01:11:02.997
You've done this to me before.

01:11:05.348 --> 01:11:07.872
- Everything I've
done was for her.

01:11:11.528 --> 01:11:12.529
I loved her.

01:11:14.705 --> 01:11:15.488
- I know.

01:11:18.012 --> 01:11:18.796
She knew.

01:11:22.365 --> 01:11:23.279
I'm leaving Albert.

01:11:25.498 --> 01:11:27.108
I have to find Abel.

01:11:29.894 --> 01:11:30.721
- [Smith] You love him.

01:11:33.027 --> 01:11:34.333
- [Eve] He is my purpose.

01:11:35.508 --> 01:11:37.641
Everything else has
been lies and betrayal.

01:11:41.122 --> 01:11:41.906
- [Smith] Eve.

01:11:44.909 --> 01:11:46.650
I won't betray you.

01:11:51.524 --> 01:11:53.570
- Mr. Brooks my apologies.

01:11:58.792 --> 01:12:00.490
- He refused to wait.

01:12:00.533 --> 01:12:03.057
He returned to Civie where the
situation is out of control.

01:12:04.842 --> 01:12:06.887
I recommend we put the
lower levels into lockdown.

01:12:06.931 --> 01:12:08.324
- Leave that with me.

01:12:08.367 --> 01:12:09.977
More importantly
we need to widen

01:12:10.021 --> 01:12:13.067
the search for food
stores, get Jimenez here.

01:12:14.068 --> 01:12:15.809
- He's not answering comms.

01:12:17.420 --> 01:12:18.856
- Does he think I'm stupid?

01:12:21.685 --> 01:12:24.165
[somber music]

01:12:25.471 --> 01:12:27.691
From knowing why you
aren't in medical

01:12:27.734 --> 01:12:29.388
Doctor let me just
cut to the chase.

01:12:29.432 --> 01:12:31.782
Mr. Jimenez has been
ill for some time

01:12:31.825 --> 01:12:33.958
which I'm surprised
you haven't noticed.

01:12:34.001 --> 01:12:36.047
He's in the Comms room
and isn't answering.

01:12:36.090 --> 01:12:38.397
Retrieve him and
accompany him to medical.

01:12:38.441 --> 01:12:39.180
Do it now.

01:12:41.835 --> 01:12:44.751
[suspenseful music]

01:12:44.795 --> 01:12:46.753
- Why do we give in
to Pope's demands?

01:12:46.797 --> 01:12:49.452
Because we're lied to
and if we say anything,

01:12:49.495 --> 01:12:51.671
anything at all they send them.

01:12:51.715 --> 01:12:54.979
And they send us Paul
Brooks to keep the peace.

01:12:55.022 --> 01:12:57.503
Why don't they send Paul
Brooks with something to eat?

01:12:57.547 --> 01:12:58.374
- [Crowd] Yeah!

01:12:59.679 --> 01:13:02.726
[contemplative music]

01:13:11.909 --> 01:13:13.389
- Turn around time in five.

01:13:14.172 --> 01:13:18.045
[contemplative music]

01:13:18.089 --> 01:13:21.309
Guys, what's that?

01:13:22.615 --> 01:13:25.966
[contemplative music]

01:13:39.284 --> 01:13:42.243
Where the hell is this?

01:13:42.287 --> 01:13:44.985
- [Eve] It's Babel.

01:13:45.029 --> 01:13:46.900
- With a piece of
something to eat.

01:13:46.944 --> 01:13:47.771
I'm hungry.

01:13:47.814 --> 01:13:48.989
I've had enough.

01:13:50.426 --> 01:13:53.690
[all shouting at once]

01:13:57.041 --> 01:14:00.044
- James for the survival of Eden

01:14:00.087 --> 01:14:02.655
I recommend shutting
Civie down now.

01:14:02.699 --> 01:14:05.397
[dramatic music]

01:14:12.317 --> 01:14:13.318
- What the hell
are you doing here?

01:14:13.361 --> 01:14:14.885
How are you doing that?

01:14:14.928 --> 01:14:16.452
How are you doing that?

If we had time I would
explain Frost but we don't.

01:14:27.506 --> 01:14:29.900
That's why I'm here to help.

01:14:31.771 --> 01:14:33.077
- Why?

01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:35.906
- Because the situation
in Eden is critical.

01:14:35.949 --> 01:14:37.647
- And of securing, what the fuck

01:14:37.690 --> 01:14:39.387

01:16:56.437 --> 01:16:58.222

01:44:42.580 --> 01:44:45.148
If you do I'll kill you.

01:44:45.191 --> 01:44:48.369
[contemplative music]

01:45:32.891 --> 01:45:33.979
- [Frost] Alexa.

01:45:34.023 --> 01:45:35.764
- [Alexa] Frost?

01:45:35.807 --> 01:45:36.678
- [Frost] Alexa.

01:45:36.721 --> 01:45:37.940
- [Alexa] Frost.

01:45:37.983 --> 01:45:38.767
Frost.

01:45:41.639 --> 01:45:44.860
[inspirational music]

01:45:46.905 --> 01:45:48.298
- Alexa are you
alright, are you okay?

01:45:48.342 --> 01:45:50.431
- [Alexa] There might be
more survivors in the lab.

01:45:50.474 --> 01:45:51.736
We have to try and reach them.

01:45:51.780 --> 01:45:54.696

01:46:03.792 --> 01:46:07.012
[all talking at once]

01:46:10.581 --> 01:46:13.192
[dramatic music]

01:46:35.519 --> 01:46:38.522
- [Computer] Rebooting
backup power systems.

01:46:38.566 --> 01:46:41.786
[inspirational music]

01:46:50.186 --> 01:46:52.884

01:47:32.620 --> 01:47:34.665
- [Paul] Paul Brooks
journal day 519.

01:47:35.971 --> 01:47:38.582
I used to think that hope was
the very last thing to die.

01:47:38.626 --> 01:47:40.062
But I realized I was wrong.

01:47:40.889 --> 01:47:43.108
The human spirit never dies.

01:47:43.152 --> 01:47:44.414
And as long as
there's human spirit

01:47:44.458 --> 01:47:46.503
there will always be hope.

01:47:46.547 --> 01:47:47.939
So now as those
of us that remain

01:47:47.983 --> 01:47:50.464
make our way towards
our new home.

01:47:50.507 --> 01:47:53.118
We start the process of
rebuilding that spirit needed

01:47:53.162 --> 01:47:55.686
to one day face those
who have done us wrong

01:47:56.948 --> 01:47:59.342
and give us hope for a
new life, a new beginning.

01:48:01.170 --> 01:48:03.215
- [Abel] I knew you'd come.

01:48:07.176 --> 01:48:08.699
- What am I doing here?

01:48:08.743 --> 01:48:11.049
- Fulfilling your purpose.

01:48:11.093 --> 01:48:13.965
[contemplative music]

01:48:15.314 --> 01:48:16.968
- Do I have a choice?

01:48:17.969 --> 01:48:20.058
- You always have a choice.

01:48:20.102 --> 01:48:22.931
But you cannot escape your fate.

01:48:25.934 --> 01:48:27.631
Make one more choice.

01:48:29.198 --> 01:48:32.506
The human race has
served it's purpose.

01:48:34.203 --> 01:48:36.074
Now we must serve ours.

01:48:40.035 --> 01:48:42.080
Will you lead this Army?

01:48:42.124 --> 01:48:44.779
[dramatic music]

01:48:50.828 --> 01:48:51.612
- I will.
