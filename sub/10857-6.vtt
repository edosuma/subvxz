WEBVTT

00:03.400 --> 00:06.000
Anomalies are starting to appear.

00:06.000 --> 00:10.000
Doorways in time to worlds
we can barely imagine.

00:10.200 --> 00:13.600
The anomalies are conclusive proof
that the past exists.

00:14.400 --> 00:18.200
In a fourth dimension as real and solid
as those we already know.

00:18.400 --> 00:21.600
Our job is to predict and contain them.

00:24.600 --> 00:27.800
Under the circumstances, I'm gonna allow
your exploratory mission into the anomaly.

00:29.400 --> 00:31.600
People. Someone's been here before us.

00:31.800 --> 00:33.200
Whoever it was, didn't get far.

00:33.400 --> 00:35.400
H.C. is Helen Cutter.

00:35.400 --> 00:38.800
I've just found out
that my dead wife was still alive.

00:41.400 --> 00:43.200
- Who's that?
- Helen Cutter.

00:43.200 --> 00:45.200
Helen, what the hell are you doing here?

00:46.800 --> 00:48.600
You're gonna have to trust me.

00:52.400 --> 00:54.000
Helen saved me.

00:55.600 --> 00:59.400
- You've taking on him, haven't you?
- I trust him, if that's what you mean.

01:42.200 --> 01:44.000
Shot!

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
Claudia Brown.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
- Having fun?
- Yes.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.800
Would you like to sit down?

01:54.800 --> 01:56.200
I've been thinking about Helen.

01:56.200 --> 01:58.000
Oh, okay.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.800
She saved my life.

02:00.600 --> 02:03.000
It was much less complicated
when she was just the enemy.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.400
Yeah, I gave up trying to
predict Helen's behaviour...

02:05.600 --> 02:08.800
when she swapped our marriage for a
packaged tour into the Permian Era.

02:08.800 --> 02:10.199
Maybe it was just a cry for help.

02:10.400 --> 02:12.400
Counselling would have been simpler.

02:12.400 --> 02:14.400
Nick Cutter talking about his feelings?

02:14.400 --> 02:15.600
I don't think so.

02:15.600 --> 02:17.200
Ought to try me.

02:17.200 --> 02:19.600
And ask me anything, anything you like.

02:19.600 --> 02:21.000
Do you still love her?

02:21.200 --> 02:22.600
Ask me another one.

02:23.200 --> 02:24.800
Coward.

02:27.400 --> 02:30.000
Was there any purpose to your visit?

02:30.200 --> 02:32.800
Or is my love life
the only item on the agenda?

02:33.400 --> 02:35.400
If we're gonna
defend ourselves more effectively...

02:35.600 --> 02:37.400
then we've got to do
something more than just react.

02:37.400 --> 02:40.000
We've got to discover
why these anomalies are opening.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.800
And then predict
when the next one will appear.

02:41.800 --> 02:45.200
Well, you know,
it may be possible to do that.

02:47.600 --> 02:49.400
Are you going to tell me how?

02:49.800 --> 02:53.000
I've got ideas, but I don't have
any proof. I need more time.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.400
Fine, how does Monday morning sound?

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
You're spoiling me now.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
- Are you okay?
- I haven't been sleeping well.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.600
Bad dreams.

03:10.200 --> 03:11.400
By the way,

03:11.400 --> 03:14.000
when those things were attacking us...

03:14.600 --> 03:16.200
you kissed me.

03:17.600 --> 03:19.400
On the lips.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.000
I know.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.600
You do you know sexual harassment...

03:22.600 --> 03:26.200
is a serious disciplinary
offence in the civil service.

04:00.200 --> 04:03.200
This is Charlie One,
security breach in section 15.

04:03.800 --> 04:06.400
Okay Charlie One,
await further instructions.

04:13.200 --> 04:15.800
No trail, no footprints. Nothing.

04:17.399 --> 04:19.600
Are you sure you didn't miss anything?

04:19.600 --> 04:21.800
If there was anything out there,
we would have found it by now.

04:22.200 --> 04:23.800
It must have gone back.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.400
Okay, I'm a girl in a bar.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.800
Tell me I look nice.

05:10.200 --> 05:12.400
- You look nice.
- Make it more personal.

05:12.400 --> 05:14.000
I personally feel you look nice.

05:15.600 --> 05:17.200
The compliment, be more specific.

05:17.400 --> 05:19.400
Well, you've got lovely legs and...

05:19.400 --> 05:21.200
- ...fantastic-
- Eehh.

05:21.800 --> 05:23.400
Yeah, no that specific.

05:23.400 --> 05:25.200
Small talk. Flirty.

05:25.200 --> 05:28.400
Just not too flirty, yeah?

05:29.000 --> 05:30.800
- I've seen you here before, haven't I?
- Oh, that's good.

05:30.800 --> 05:33.400
Your glass is empty,
let me get you another one.

05:33.800 --> 05:35.800
I'll have a mojito, please.

05:35.800 --> 05:37.800
Two mojitos, coming up.

05:38.200 --> 05:39.800
Bar man.

05:44.600 --> 05:49.200
Who do you think would win in a fight
between Wolverine and Spiderman?

05:49.200 --> 05:50.400
I said flirty, not nerdy.

05:50.400 --> 05:53.600
That's entry level comic book, Abby.
It's light, it's fun.

05:53.600 --> 05:56.200
But girls don't talk comic books.

05:56.200 --> 05:59.400
If you wanna be more successful with women
you gotta learn to compromise a bit.

05:59.400 --> 06:01.000
Find out what they like.

06:01.200 --> 06:02.800
And pretend I'm interested.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.800
Until they want to snout me.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.200
No, I get it.
But, Abby, you know, to be honest,

06:07.200 --> 06:09.000
I think I can talk to women.

06:09.200 --> 06:11.800
- I talk to you, don't I?
- We're pals.

06:12.200 --> 06:16.800
- Yeah, but you can...
- Come here.

06:16.800 --> 06:19.200
You can fancy somebody who's a pal.

06:19.600 --> 06:20.800
Can't you?

06:21.200 --> 06:25.000
The two conditions are not
mutually exclusive.

06:29.400 --> 06:31.800
It's the zoo,
something's up. I got to go.

06:32.600 --> 06:35.200
He made a mistake about Helen.
He should have told us about her.

06:35.200 --> 06:37.200
But he was under enormous pressure.

06:37.600 --> 06:39.400
He predicted the temporal fault lines.

06:39.400 --> 06:41.600
And he's been correct
about the anomalies reoccurring.

06:41.600 --> 06:43.000
That's not just luck.

06:43.000 --> 06:46.600
If there's anyone who can help us predict
and contain these things, it's him.

06:46.600 --> 06:47.800
How close is he to an answer?

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
I don't know, he couldn't say yet.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
Look, one day soon, an anomaly is going to
open up and thousands of these creatures,

06:54.200 --> 06:56.600
maybe millions, are
gonna come crawling through it.

06:57.400 --> 07:00.800
Let's hope he's made his mind up by then.

07:29.600 --> 07:33.000
In most eras of the world's history
you'd be dead by now.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.400
Helen.

07:36.200 --> 07:38.400
What the hell are you doing here?

07:39.000 --> 07:42.600
All this urban living has made
human beings such a lazy animals.

07:42.600 --> 07:45.200
Second level hearing, no sense of smell.

07:45.400 --> 07:48.200
- No worthwhile instincts.
- Well, there's no predators.

07:48.200 --> 07:51.000
We have nothing to be afraid of
except each other.

07:51.200 --> 07:54.800
Well, that used to be the case, but
times are changing, aren't they Stephen?

07:55.600 --> 07:57.600
What do you want?

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
A cold beer would be nice.

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
See, first we thought the lions had been
fighting but none of them are wounded.

08:08.400 --> 08:10.200
Then we realized we've lost one.

08:10.200 --> 08:13.600
You put it out somewhere, and forgot
where you left it. Happens all the time.

08:17.200 --> 08:19.200
Looks like something got wounded.

08:23.800 --> 08:26.200
- Could it be a creature attack?
- I don't know.

08:30.600 --> 08:32.400
There's no proof, is there?

08:32.400 --> 08:34.600
All you've got is a missing lion.

08:35.200 --> 08:38.200
- Maybe it just runaway to join a circus.
- Oh, whatever.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.800
Why don't you just
tell me what do you want?

08:45.000 --> 08:47.600
A meeting. With Nick and Lester.

08:47.600 --> 08:50.000
Tomorrow morning at 11:00, here.

08:52.200 --> 08:55.400
No armed thugs. No ambushes.
They want to hear what I have to say.

08:55.400 --> 08:58.000
- They don't trust you.
- I don't trust them either.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.200
But this is serious.

09:00.800 --> 09:04.800
Three people have disappeared in the last
48 hours. I know what happened to them.

09:07.400 --> 09:09.200
A creature.

09:10.200 --> 09:12.200
What kind?

09:13.600 --> 09:15.400
It's good to see you again, Stephen.

09:15.600 --> 09:18.200
You know, you were
always one of my best students.

09:18.400 --> 09:21.000
Not the brightest maybe but so full of...

09:21.200 --> 09:23.800
idealism and integrity.

09:29.400 --> 09:31.400
I miss that.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.600
Thank you. I'm touched.

09:39.200 --> 09:41.400
Hello?

11:22.800 --> 11:24.000
Thanks for calling.

11:24.200 --> 11:26.800
No, no sign of the lion as yet.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
We're still hopeful obviously.

11:29.600 --> 11:31.800
Yes, yes.

11:43.600 --> 11:45.800
Stephen was acting
really strange this morning.

11:46.600 --> 11:48.400
Something weird is going on.

11:50.200 --> 11:51.800
What's new?

11:52.400 --> 11:55.000
Oh, I never said. The blood
analysis came back from the lab.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.800
Most of it was from a lion,
but some of it was from a bat.

11:59.400 --> 12:01.200
Bats get everywhere.

12:01.800 --> 12:04.600
Yeah, but it's a really weird DNA.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.400
They said they've never
seen anything like it before.

12:08.200 --> 12:10.000
What does that mean then?

12:10.600 --> 12:13.400
I don't know... Yet.

12:16.200 --> 12:18.600
- Are you expecting a call?
- My boss.

12:20.400 --> 12:24.000
No one's seen him since yesterday. They
found his stuff, but there's no sign of him.

12:25.600 --> 12:27.400
He just vanished.

12:28.400 --> 12:29.600
POLICE BAFFLED AS THIRD PERSON
GOES MISSING

12:29.800 --> 12:31.400
I'll get back to the zoo.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
Are you sure you don't
already know what all this is about?

12:34.000 --> 12:36.800
- Sorry, what does that mean?
- She's your wife. You join the dots.

12:36.800 --> 12:40.200
Helen did save my life. I think
we should give her some credit for that.

12:40.800 --> 12:43.000
And if she does know something
about the disappearances-

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
Now that's a police matter. There's
no evidence of creature involvement.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.400
Yet.

12:51.200 --> 12:52.800
Okay, fine, we'll do it her way.

12:52.800 --> 12:55.600
But if this turns out to be another
of her manipulative little schemes,

12:55.600 --> 12:59.200
the deal's off and she goes
straight back on the wanted list.

13:11.600 --> 13:14.000
You have a serious creature incursion.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
A highly evolved ambush predator.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.200
Intelligent, adaptable and ruthless.

13:19.200 --> 13:21.600
If there was a creature on the loose
we'd know about it.

13:21.600 --> 13:24.000
At least three people have
disappeared in the last few days.

13:24.400 --> 13:26.000
- Missing.
- Killed.

13:26.600 --> 13:29.400
The creature has a lair somewhere
nearby and it has taken them for food.

13:29.600 --> 13:32.400
- How do you know that?
- Because it nearly got me too.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.400
What is it?

13:36.400 --> 13:39.200
- It has no name.
- Then what era is it from?

13:44.400 --> 13:46.200
It doesn't come from any era.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
At least not one
that can be identified yet.

13:49.200 --> 13:50.200
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

13:50.400 --> 13:53.000
Yes, you do Nick.
You knew that'd happen one day.

13:53.200 --> 13:56.000
You've known it ever
since you stepped into the past.

13:58.800 --> 14:00.200
The future?

14:02.600 --> 14:05.400
Are you saying we're being attacked
by a creature from the future?

14:25.400 --> 14:28.200
I've seen a lot of amazing creatures
but nothing like this one.

14:28.600 --> 14:30.000
It has human levels of intelligence,

14:30.200 --> 14:33.200
and abnormal supernatural
ability to stalk its prey.

14:33.800 --> 14:36.000
It could be right here
now watching us and we'll never know.

14:38.200 --> 14:40.600
If it's so clever, how did you see it?

14:40.800 --> 14:43.800
I discovered it in the
Permian just after it had killed.

14:45.200 --> 14:46.800
It was feeding
and its defences were down.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.400
And what does it look like?

14:48.400 --> 14:51.000
Like a great ape, but bigger...

14:51.400 --> 14:53.400
faster and a lot more agile.

14:53.400 --> 14:55.800
Ok, hold on, what makes you
so certain that it's not some...

14:55.800 --> 14:59.200
lost species that just disappeared
from the evolutionary record?

14:59.200 --> 15:03.200
No Nick, it's not like any creature from
the Permian or any other prehistoric era.

15:03.400 --> 15:05.800
The only possible
explanation is that it strayed...

15:05.800 --> 15:09.000
through a future anomaly into
the Permian era and then on to ours.

15:11.200 --> 15:15.200
You know, I'm really beginning to regret
not staying in management consultancy.

15:15.800 --> 15:17.400
So now's the future as well.

15:17.800 --> 15:20.200
And apparently we can't
do a damn thing about it.

15:20.400 --> 15:22.000
How did it get here?

15:22.600 --> 15:24.000
I have no idea.

15:25.200 --> 15:27.200
It was only when I got back
I found out that it was on the loose.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.800
Obviously my first thought was
to do as much as I can to help.

15:30.800 --> 15:32.800
How public spiriting of you.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.600
Where can we contact you?

15:38.000 --> 15:42.000
At my house. Of course.

15:46.800 --> 15:48.800
You could have redecorated.

15:49.600 --> 15:51.400
I like it.

15:54.800 --> 15:56.200
Anyway.

15:56.400 --> 15:58.200
Are you gonna
tell me why you were lying?

15:59.200 --> 16:00.800
I've no idea
of what you're talking about.

16:02.800 --> 16:05.600
Well, the others buy that lie
of you just wanting to help us.

16:05.800 --> 16:07.800
But I've known
you for longer than they have.

16:12.400 --> 16:15.000
Everything I said
about the Permian was true.

16:15.400 --> 16:17.800
I discovered the creature
and made my observations.

16:19.400 --> 16:22.800
But I got too fascinated.
I got too close.

16:24.400 --> 16:25.800
It sensed I was watching.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.800
So you became the prey.

16:27.800 --> 16:29.400
Yeah, I only just got away.

16:35.600 --> 16:38.000
The problem was
my escape route led me back here.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.200
And it followed you.

16:39.400 --> 16:40.800
So this is your fault.

16:40.800 --> 16:42.400
I could have walked away.

16:43.400 --> 16:45.200
But I didn't, I stayed to help.

16:48.600 --> 16:50.400
I'm still human, Nick.

16:50.800 --> 16:52.600
I do care for what happens.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.400
Believe it or not, I do care about you.

17:00.600 --> 17:03.200
- That's all she said?
- That's it.

17:03.600 --> 17:06.000
Nothing else? No details at all?

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
Why? Put it down.

17:10.800 --> 17:13.000
It's just I found some
bat blood at the zoo yesterday.

17:13.200 --> 17:14.000
So?

17:14.000 --> 17:17.800
Well, this bat blood had really,
really screwed up DNA.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.800
I mean, you know,
it's probably nothing, but...

17:21.000 --> 17:25.800
one of the lion's went missing yesterday and
now Abby's boss he just disappeared as well.

17:25.800 --> 17:27.599
Where's Abby?

17:27.599 --> 17:29.200
She said she was working late.

17:29.200 --> 17:30.400
Meet me at the zoo.

17:30.600 --> 17:33.000
With as much backup as possible.

17:48.800 --> 17:51.800
- Don't creep up on me like that.
- I wasn't creeping.

17:54.600 --> 17:56.400
I was walking, normally.

17:58.800 --> 18:00.200
Are you all right?

18:00.600 --> 18:02.000
Why shouldn't I be?

18:03.000 --> 18:04.800
There might be a creature here.

18:05.200 --> 18:09.400
We think it killed the lion and
maybe your boss.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
The others are on the way.

18:14.600 --> 18:17.000
You came on your own
just cause you were worried about me.

18:17.200 --> 18:19.600
Well, you and the sea lions.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.400
I'll hate it if anything hurt them.

18:26.200 --> 18:28.200
What are you doing?

18:33.800 --> 18:35.800
There's something down here.

19:12.800 --> 19:15.000
If we're ready to try and contain it...

19:16.400 --> 19:17.800
- ...we can't afford to lose anybody.
- If you want to find its lair...

19:18.000 --> 19:19.600
you're going to need dogs.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.400
Excuse me.

19:26.800 --> 19:28.600
You saved my life.

19:28.800 --> 19:30.200
Thank you.

19:30.400 --> 19:34.000
Although, now I come to think of it
you did leave it rather late.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.200
Well, you know,
you were doing so well without me.

19:36.400 --> 19:38.600
It was only when Nick ran off
that I thought I should intervene.

19:38.600 --> 19:40.400
He didn't run off.

19:40.400 --> 19:42.000
He went to get help.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.800
He did everything he could to protect me.

19:43.800 --> 19:45.800
He's attracted to you, isn't he?

19:45.800 --> 19:47.000
I have no idea.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.400
It's obvious you like him.

19:48.600 --> 19:50.200
That's really none of your business.

19:50.200 --> 19:52.400
- He's my husband.
- You left him.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.400
Remember?

19:55.200 --> 19:56.400
You know, I can see...

19:56.800 --> 20:00.000
why he's interested.
You're his type, Claudia.

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
Strong, independent,

20:03.400 --> 20:05.600
reasonably intelligent.

20:06.600 --> 20:08.200
Should we stick to the point?

20:08.600 --> 20:11.200
So what can
you tell us about this creature?

20:12.200 --> 20:15.600
It's fast, incredibly fast.

20:15.800 --> 20:18.200
And it can camouflage itself in
almost any environment.

20:18.200 --> 20:22.600
To survive in the Permian it had to be
highly adaptable, which is bad news for us.

20:23.800 --> 20:25.200
Who knows?

20:25.200 --> 20:27.000
Maybe that's how humanity meets its end.

20:27.200 --> 20:30.200
By becoming the food source
for more successful species.

20:33.600 --> 20:36.400
The creature's lair
must be somewhere very close.

20:41.400 --> 20:43.600
What happens when we find this thing?

20:44.800 --> 20:46.000
We kill it.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
I thought we only
kill these creatures in self defence.

20:48.200 --> 20:49.800
This one's too dangerous.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.400
And if we kill it
we can't affect the past...

20:52.600 --> 20:54.200
or the present.

20:54.400 --> 20:56.400
Shoot to kill.
That makes a refreshing change.

20:56.600 --> 20:59.000
I was beginning to feel
like a social worker.

21:27.400 --> 21:28.800
There's nothing.

21:32.400 --> 21:35.000
Make sure you verify your target.

21:44.800 --> 21:46.200
Look up!

22:04.400 --> 22:07.200
What the hell was that?
We need a bigger gun.

22:11.200 --> 22:13.400
It's one step ahead of us all the time.

22:13.400 --> 22:15.600
It knew what we were going
to do before we even did it.

22:15.600 --> 22:16.600
I warned you it was smart.

22:16.600 --> 22:19.200
It'd be more helpful if
you could tell us how to catch it.

22:19.600 --> 22:22.400
What we need
is something that gives us an edge...

22:22.400 --> 22:24.800
some weakness
in its defences. Otherwise...

22:24.800 --> 22:26.800
it's just gonna pick us up one by one.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.800
The dogs. The dogs went crazy
before it attacked.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.800
What would make them go off like that?

22:31.800 --> 22:34.800
It can't be smell, if there was
a scent trail they'd have followed it.

22:36.200 --> 22:37.400
Hearing.

22:37.600 --> 22:38.600
- A sound.
- They heard something.

22:38.600 --> 22:39.600
It's using sound.

22:39.600 --> 22:41.800
That's why
it manages to stay ahead of us.

22:41.800 --> 22:45.800
It can detect physical movement
before it's within visual range.

22:45.800 --> 22:47.600
And the dogs they detect a higher frequency.

22:47.600 --> 22:49.000
That's how they know when it's nearby.

22:49.600 --> 22:51.000
Like echo location.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
High frequency sound waves.
It's like a sonar system.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.600
Some animals use it to detect prey.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.200
Like a bat.

22:57.400 --> 22:59.800
Well, you said there was
bat blood in the lion enclosure.

22:59.800 --> 23:01.200
That's it.

23:01.200 --> 23:05.000
That's it, this thing must be some
kind of, I don't know, super bat.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.600
He's right.

23:07.600 --> 23:10.200
Three quarters of
all mammal species are bats or rats.

23:10.200 --> 23:12.200
Maybe the future belongs to them.

23:13.400 --> 23:15.000
We can use its own weapon against it.

23:15.200 --> 23:16.800
- An oscilloscope?
- It's in the car.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.600
Go get it.

23:22.800 --> 23:24.800
Okay, I know it's in here somewhere.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.400
Okay.

25:03.200 --> 25:04.600
It's fast.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.400
I thought I was gonna die there.

25:12.400 --> 25:13.800
But you didn't.

25:13.800 --> 25:15.200
No.

25:15.400 --> 25:17.000
I'm quite chuffed about that.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.600
Maybe you should go home.

25:24.200 --> 25:25.600
No, I'm gonna stay.

25:25.800 --> 25:29.600
I mean, Han Solo, he wouldn't give up
before the job's done, would he?

25:35.200 --> 25:39.000
I always saw
you more as R2D2 myself but...

25:39.600 --> 25:41.600
I take the point.

25:48.400 --> 25:51.000
- Hi.
- Hi.

25:52.400 --> 25:55.400
You just saved my life.

25:55.600 --> 25:57.200
I had to.

25:57.800 --> 25:59.800
You haven't paid this month's rent yet.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.600
- Abby.
- Yeah.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.800
Thank you.

26:17.800 --> 26:19.200
What do they keep in here?

26:19.200 --> 26:21.000
It's an animals crate storage.

26:21.600 --> 26:23.000
Great place for a lair.

26:29.200 --> 26:31.200
Whatever is making
that noise is right on top of us.

26:31.200 --> 26:33.000
The dogs should be going crazy.

26:49.800 --> 26:52.000
It's in here somewhere.

26:55.600 --> 26:58.600
Cutter! You need to see this.

27:09.600 --> 27:11.200
My God, it's giving birth.

27:13.000 --> 27:14.600
Cute.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.600
There are three bodies back here.

27:18.800 --> 27:20.800
She's storing it to feed her youngs.

27:25.400 --> 27:27.200
We've got company!

27:31.800 --> 27:33.400
Where the hell is it?

27:37.800 --> 27:39.200
Stephen!

29:01.400 --> 29:04.000
If you kill them now,
you'll be making a big mistake.

29:04.200 --> 29:07.400
What do you suggest?
A sympathetic foster family?

29:08.000 --> 29:10.600
A dangerous anomaly to
the future it's opened in the Permian.

29:10.600 --> 29:12.200
Predators could come pouring through it.

29:12.400 --> 29:14.800
But why should
we keep these animals alive?

29:15.200 --> 29:17.600
To pin point
the exact location of the anomaly.

29:18.200 --> 29:20.000
All bats have
extraordinary homing instincts.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.400
They'll know their own environment,
they can lead us to it.

29:22.600 --> 29:25.000
- And what happens to them then?
- We kill them.

29:27.400 --> 29:29.000
We kill them.

29:29.000 --> 29:32.400
To let even one
of them loose in the Permian era...

29:32.600 --> 29:34.800
could be a potential catastrophe.

29:35.400 --> 29:37.200
They can wipe out whole species.

29:37.200 --> 29:40.200
They can change things
in ways we can't even conceive.

29:40.400 --> 29:42.600
And afterwards we keep a permanent
guard at the future anomaly?

29:42.800 --> 29:45.000
The threat's too serious to be ignored.

29:45.200 --> 29:48.200
Serious enough to warrant
a permanent intrusion into the past?

29:48.200 --> 29:50.600
With the correct restrictions, yes.

29:55.200 --> 29:58.000
I suppose just bombing
somewhere is out of question.

29:59.600 --> 30:03.000
All right, we'll do it.
I just hope you're right.

31:01.600 --> 31:03.600
We never discussed living arrangements.

31:03.800 --> 31:05.400
I'm gonna take the spare room.

31:05.400 --> 31:07.200
You don't have to.

31:07.200 --> 31:09.200
We're still married.

31:17.600 --> 31:19.800
Excuse me.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.600
Be careful with them.
They're our only hope...

31:44.600 --> 31:46.800
of finding the future anomaly.

31:48.600 --> 31:50.600
If I don't make it back...

31:51.800 --> 31:54.000
push Lester through
the worst anomaly you can find.

31:54.200 --> 31:55.800
It's a given.

32:00.200 --> 32:03.000
What happens if it closes
while you're on the other side?

32:03.400 --> 32:06.200
We'll wait until it reopens.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
I think we should get going.

32:14.800 --> 32:17.400
Don't go. Stay.

32:17.600 --> 32:21.400
I think this is a mistake.
I've got a really bad feeling about this.

32:21.800 --> 32:24.400
It's gonna be fine.

32:25.600 --> 32:27.600
I'll see you soon.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.800
You think I should make a speech?

32:42.800 --> 32:45.000
"One small step for a man... "
that sort of thing?

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
Maybe another time.

33:17.800 --> 33:19.600
That wasn't very professional.

33:19.800 --> 33:22.000
Sod off professionalism.

33:44.600 --> 33:46.800
That was a very touching farewell.

33:47.800 --> 33:50.000
Yup, it worked for me.

33:51.000 --> 33:54.400
I suppose the object of the
exercise was to punish me in some way.

33:54.600 --> 33:57.200
No, actually, it wasn't about you at all.

34:03.200 --> 34:05.000
Yeah.

34:05.000 --> 34:06.400
Are you sure?

34:08.199 --> 34:09.600
There's no chance
you could have made a mistake?

34:09.600 --> 34:11.199
Connor, give me the phone.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.400
- Okay, I understand, thanks.
- The lab?

34:14.600 --> 34:16.199
Yeah.

34:16.600 --> 34:20.199
The creature's autopsy
proves beyond any doubt that it was...

34:20.400 --> 34:22.199
definitely a male.

34:23.199 --> 34:25.199
It's got to be a female,
it was nurturing its young.

34:25.199 --> 34:27.199
Maybe in that species
that's a job for the boys.

34:27.400 --> 34:30.199
It better be. Because if not...

34:31.400 --> 34:33.400
it means the mother's still out there.

34:50.199 --> 34:51.600
What happened?

34:52.000 --> 34:54.600
- I'm not sure.
- Did you see something?

34:54.600 --> 34:56.400
Nothing.

34:57.200 --> 35:00.600
- Is the anomaly getting weaker?
- No, no change.

35:22.400 --> 35:25.200
Hey, Nick! Come here.

35:28.400 --> 35:30.000
Here.

35:30.600 --> 35:33.000
Let's go take a souvenir.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
Stand up.

36:08.000 --> 36:09.200
What?

36:10.200 --> 36:11.600
The camp.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.200
It's the camp we found the first time.

36:14.200 --> 36:15.800
We made it.

36:18.600 --> 36:21.400
It's us. We are the intruders.

36:22.800 --> 36:24.800
The camp we found was old.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
There was a dead body.

36:28.600 --> 36:32.200
Don't you see? We've arrived five
years before the first time we came here.

36:33.800 --> 36:36.000
We've created our own past.

36:41.600 --> 36:43.600
We must be near the anomaly.

36:46.800 --> 36:48.200
This is it, Nick.

36:48.600 --> 36:52.200
We found it. We found the future.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.200
That's all you cared about.

36:56.800 --> 36:59.600
You just wanted
to find the future for yourself.

37:13.800 --> 37:15.600
Stand back!

39:22.800 --> 39:24.800
The first time we came here...

39:25.400 --> 39:27.600
that body we found...

39:27.600 --> 39:29.600
that was me, wasn't it?

39:30.000 --> 39:32.400
I was looking at myself.

39:43.200 --> 39:45.200
Did any of the young survive?

39:45.600 --> 39:48.000
It looks like they're all dead.

39:49.400 --> 39:51.400
This is over, we're leaving.

39:52.000 --> 39:54.200
We should bury the men.

40:06.200 --> 40:08.400
We don't have to go back, Nick.

40:09.400 --> 40:13.200
The future anomaly must be here
somewhere. We can still find it.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
The future?

40:17.600 --> 40:20.600
Helen Cutter's last great frontier.

40:23.400 --> 40:26.600
No. If you wanna
stay here and look for it, it's fine.

40:26.800 --> 40:28.400
It's fine.

40:28.600 --> 40:32.000
But you're gonna have to do it
on your own. Cause I'm leaving.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.200
What do you got to get back for?

40:35.600 --> 40:37.400
That girl?

40:40.800 --> 40:43.400
Please don't tell
me you're in love with her.

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
Maybe, you know, maybe.

40:47.400 --> 40:51.200
- That's not really the point.
- And what is the point professor?

40:51.400 --> 40:53.800
The point is that I know where I belong.

41:32.400 --> 41:34.600
What happened? Did you find the anomaly?

41:36.600 --> 41:41.000
Captain Ryan didn't make it.
And all his men are dead.

41:41.200 --> 41:43.400
Whatever happens,
nobody goes back through.

41:43.600 --> 41:46.800
Well, I'm sorry to break
your new rule so soon, Nick, but...

41:48.200 --> 41:49.800
I'm not staying.

41:50.400 --> 41:52.200
But what did you come back through for?

41:52.200 --> 41:54.200
Oh, just a little...

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
unfinished business.

41:58.400 --> 42:00.400
You see, Nick,
it was just one of those things...

42:00.400 --> 42:04.000
I was lonely and you
didn't seem to care about me...

42:04.000 --> 42:06.200
and Stephen was so...

42:07.600 --> 42:11.000
sweet and attentive.

42:11.200 --> 42:14.000
- Shut up Helen.
- You mean you never told him?

42:19.800 --> 42:21.600
Oh dear.

42:25.200 --> 42:27.000
What an extremely awkward moment.

42:27.200 --> 42:30.400
You see, I don't
want to be on my own anymore.

42:36.600 --> 42:39.400
You once said you'd do anything
for me if I gave you the chance.

42:39.400 --> 42:41.000
Well, here it is.

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
- Come with me.
- Don't do this.

42:44.000 --> 42:47.200
Falling for one of your
students is never a good idea, but...

42:48.400 --> 42:51.400
sometimes these
things just happen, you know?

42:51.800 --> 42:55.000
How could you keep that
from me for so many years?

42:55.000 --> 42:58.000
There wasn't a point in saying anything.

42:58.000 --> 43:01.000
It was a long time ago, in the past.

43:01.000 --> 43:04.600
The past has the habit
of coming back these days, doesn't it?

43:18.000 --> 43:21.600
Well, are you coming?

43:28.200 --> 43:30.600
You know what I forgot, Helen?

43:30.600 --> 43:33.200
Sometimes you can be a real bitch.

43:49.800 --> 43:51.600
Where's Claudia?

43:52.800 --> 43:56.000
- Claudia?
- Where is Claudia Brown?

43:56.400 --> 43:58.600
I don't know anyone with that name.

44:02.000 --> 44:04.400
- No, come on, where is she?
- Really, we...

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
- ...don't know what you're talking about.
- Never heard of her.

44:07.000 --> 44:09.800
You've been working
with her every day for months.

44:09.800 --> 44:12.400
So don't tell
me you don't know who she is.

44:13.200 --> 44:15.600
No idea, I'm so sorry.

44:17.600 --> 44:20.000
Look, look, where is she?

44:20.000 --> 44:23.000
- Cutter, we don't know her.
- No one knows her.

44:24.000 --> 44:25.800
Wait, something's wrong.

44:25.800 --> 44:28.800
This isn't right. Something's
going wrong. Something happened.

44:29.000 --> 44:31.200
Something's changed.
We've done something.

44:34.200 --> 44:38.200
Something that we've done has changed
the past and she's not here anymore.

44:47.200 --> 44:49.800
Oh my God.
