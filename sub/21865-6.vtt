Uh, Commissioner?

01:59.038 --> 02:00.541
Excuse the interruption.

02:00.541 --> 02:01.744
Detective Martin
Riggs, LAPD.

02:01.744 --> 02:03.981
I'm here to speak
on behalf of the prisoner.

02:03.981 --> 02:05.585
Step forward, Detective.

02:05.585 --> 02:07.622
(clears throat softly)

02:09.526 --> 02:11.462
How do you know
Mr. Voss?

02:11.462 --> 02:12.899
Over the past few years,

02:12.899 --> 02:15.270
Jake Voss has been
our most valuable informant.

02:15.270 --> 02:17.709
He's assisted me in many of
my criminal investigations.

02:17.709 --> 02:19.880
COMMISSIONER: Are you aware,
Detective, that Mr. Voss

02:19.880 --> 02:21.617
has been in
and out of jail

02:21.617 --> 02:22.886
since he was 18?

02:22.886 --> 02:25.958
Oh, from what I understand, he
was much younger than that, sir.

02:25.958 --> 02:26.960
(quiet chuckle)

02:28.363 --> 02:31.570
Our concern, simply put, is:

02:31.570 --> 02:33.974
has Mr. Voss been rehabilitated?

02:35.711 --> 02:37.715
In my professional
opinion

02:37.715 --> 02:39.719
as a law enforcement officer...

02:40.721 --> 02:42.491
I'd say absolutely.

02:42.491 --> 02:44.529
GUARD:
Open the gate!

02:47.602 --> 02:49.338
Close it up!

Informant?

02:51.643 --> 02:53.614
What the hell, man?

02:53.614 --> 02:55.685
If that gets out
on the streets, I'm done.

02:55.685 --> 02:58.958
Are these the same
streets you're gonna do
your canine charity work?

02:58.958 --> 03:00.795
When I said that
you helped me

03:00.795 --> 03:03.299
in my criminal investigations,
I wasn't lying‐‐

03:03.299 --> 03:05.638
considering everything I
ever learned about crooks,

03:05.638 --> 03:07.508
I learned from you.

03:08.409 --> 03:10.013
I appreciate that.

03:10.013 --> 03:11.717
You appreciate it?
Come here.

03:11.717 --> 03:14.021
Just don't make me
regret it, all right?

03:14.021 --> 03:16.927
I wasn't lying in there
when I said I didn't want
to go back to prison.

03:16.927 --> 03:17.862
Good.

03:19.064 --> 03:20.768
What?

03:22.437 --> 03:23.641
(grunts)

03:23.641 --> 03:25.076
What are you
doing? Huh?
Oh...

03:25.076 --> 03:27.949
Hey, I just always wanted
to hit a cop.
Yeah?

03:27.949 --> 03:29.753
Prison's made you soft, Jakey.

03:29.753 --> 03:32.124
Of course.
All I could think about in there

03:32.124 --> 03:34.796
was Molly and my son Ben.

03:34.796 --> 03:37.568
You know they moved up here
to be closer to me?

03:37.568 --> 03:39.839
Wait a minute. Molly
left Texas for your ass?

03:39.839 --> 03:41.042
Yeah, like, five weeks ago.

03:41.042 --> 03:42.979
And she's gonna flip
when she sees me.

03:42.979 --> 03:44.716
And you, too.
Come on, let's go. Load up.

03:44.716 --> 03:47.454
(horn honks)
Uh, well...

03:47.454 --> 03:48.724
I got to run, Detective.

03:48.724 --> 03:51.495
Uh, me and my friend Kenny
got an appointment

03:51.495 --> 03:52.665
at the parole office,
thanks to you.

03:52.665 --> 03:55.504
Tomorrow night,
swing by Molly's‐‐
she'd love to see you.

03:55.504 --> 03:56.873
And I want you
to meet Ben.

03:56.873 --> 03:58.510
Chip off the old block.

03:58.510 --> 04:00.548
Hope not.

MURTAUGH:
<i>RJ, what are you doing home?</i>

04:11.870 --> 04:14.776
Laundry. I‐I ran
out of detergent
in my dorm room.

04:14.776 --> 04:16.479
And here, it's free.

04:16.479 --> 04:17.715
No, it's not.

04:17.715 --> 04:18.984
<i>I</i> paid for it.

04:18.984 --> 04:20.453
You realize the money
that you wasted

04:20.453 --> 04:23.594
on gas driving here
could have been used to
buy your own detergent?

04:23.594 --> 04:28.036
ROGER JR.: Wrong. I used <i>Dad's</i>
gas card, and that's free, too.

04:28.036 --> 04:29.706
RJ, do you not
understand
Hey!

04:29.706 --> 04:30.875
the word "free"?

04:30.875 --> 04:34.582
Who put reefer in this box?

04:34.582 --> 04:36.753
RJ, I am very
disappointed in you.

04:36.753 --> 04:37.822
Me?
Mm‐hmm.

04:37.822 --> 04:38.891
You must be high right now.

04:38.891 --> 04:40.193
'Cause it's
not mine...

04:40.193 --> 04:41.095
Hey, enough.

04:43.066 --> 04:47.040
Who invited Mary Jane
into my house?

04:47.040 --> 04:49.746
It's not mine.
I don't even live here.

04:51.650 --> 04:52.919
Okay, look,

04:52.919 --> 04:55.791
you can talk to me‐‐
it's okay.

04:55.791 --> 04:56.927
Remember...

04:56.927 --> 04:58.764
I'm the cool parent.

05:00.166 --> 05:02.872
(laughing)
What are you
laughing at?

05:02.872 --> 05:05.644
You know what?
No one's gonna fess up?

05:05.644 --> 05:06.847
If only someone

05:06.847 --> 05:09.886
in this house had access

05:09.886 --> 05:13.627
to a high‐tech
law enforcement laboratory,

05:13.627 --> 05:14.896
where one...

05:14.896 --> 05:16.165
Ow.
single...

05:16.165 --> 05:16.967
strand of hair

05:16.967 --> 05:21.108
could be tested
for marijuana use.

05:21.108 --> 05:23.479
So...

05:23.479 --> 05:25.985
...does any one of you
have something to say

05:25.985 --> 05:28.757
before I have these analyzed?

05:28.757 --> 05:31.763
At least we got hair
to pluck, Mr. Clean.

05:31.763 --> 05:33.834
(snickering)

05:33.834 --> 05:35.938
I hope it's you.

05:35.938 --> 05:37.542
I think it's Riana.

05:37.542 --> 05:39.812
She probably fell in with
a couple of beatniks.

05:39.812 --> 05:41.048
Or it could be RJ.

05:41.048 --> 05:43.687
You know, he's in college now‐‐
he could be experimenting.

05:43.687 --> 05:44.856
Or it's both of 'em

05:44.856 --> 05:46.125
having a little
brother‐sister bake‐off.

05:46.125 --> 05:47.929
Oh, you think
this is funny?

05:47.929 --> 05:50.701
They probably think weed
is cool because of you.

05:50.701 --> 05:52.872
Look, I'm just saying
they're good kids.

05:52.872 --> 05:54.141
Right? Stoned or not.

05:54.141 --> 05:55.811

such a good mood?

05:55.811 --> 05:57.047

05:57.047 --> 05:58.517
You know, nice to see
a familiar face.

05:58.517 --> 05:59.953
I didn't know you had
other friends.
Yeah.

05:59.953 --> 06:01.121
When am I gonna meet him?

06:01.121 --> 06:02.959
That's not gonna happen.

06:02.959 --> 06:04.127
Why not?

06:04.127 --> 06:05.664

BOWMAN:
<i>Detectives, meet Albert</i>

06:08.704 --> 06:10.541
and Candi Cook.
This morning they returned home

06:10.541 --> 06:12.878
from Palm Springs to find
their safe cracked open and...

06:12.878 --> 06:14.649
The bastard stole
my gold bars.

06:14.649 --> 06:16.118
Your gold bars?

06:16.118 --> 06:18.089
Well, I declare.
20, to be exact.

06:18.089 --> 06:20.894
Worth three mil.
CANDI:
Albert recently

06:20.894 --> 06:23.199
transferred our entire
savings into physical gold.

06:23.199 --> 06:26.138
Well, what was I supposed to do,
invest in the stock market?

06:26.138 --> 06:27.675
Please. You get
better odds

06:27.675 --> 06:28.677
in Vegas.

06:28.677 --> 06:30.914
Trust me, folks, I, uh,
I ran a hedge fund.

06:30.914 --> 06:33.720
Interesting. So I'm assuming
you're pretty bullish

06:33.720 --> 06:34.756
on gold's
long‐term outlook.

MURTAUGH:
Hmm. So his partner waited
for him to open his safe,

07:09.992 --> 07:11.996
shot him, and then
took the gold?

07:11.996 --> 07:14.468

worse partner than me.

08:02.163 --> 08:03.900
Well, it goes without saying.

08:03.900 --> 08:06.639
Right. I think
we'd get along famously.

08:06.639 --> 08:07.508

Uh, we put out a BOLO

08:13.887 --> 08:15.189
but nothing yet.
BAILEY:
I've compiled

08:15.189 --> 08:16.926
a list of Kenny Stokes'
associates.

08:16.926 --> 08:18.295
Considering he was
just paroled, I figured

08:18.295 --> 08:19.665
I'd look into his
former cellmates.

08:19.665 --> 08:20.934
You know what?
I'll take that.

08:20.934 --> 08:22.203
Good for you, Riggs.

08:22.203 --> 08:24.007
But isn't this something
you normally hand over

08:24.007 --> 08:25.911
to Bowman and Bailey?

08:26.813 --> 08:28.950
N... Normally, yes.

08:28.950 --> 08:32.558
Uh, but... that's all
gonna change today.

08:35.931 --> 08:37.801

09:02.250 --> 09:04.087
Molly Hendricks.

09:04.087 --> 09:05.857
Okay. We'll get right on it.

09:05.857 --> 09:07.060
Now, Roger,

09:07.060 --> 09:08.830
how may I assist you?

09:08.830 --> 09:09.899
Oh. (clears throat)

09:09.899 --> 09:11.401
I need you...

09:11.401 --> 09:14.374
to run an analysis
on these two hairs.

09:14.374 --> 09:17.380
I don't remember finding
any hairs at the crime scene.

09:17.380 --> 09:19.384
Yeah. They're‐they're
for a different case.

09:19.384 --> 09:21.923
Now, I need you to test them
for marijuana,

09:21.923 --> 09:23.860
but don't put the results
in the system.

09:23.860 --> 09:24.996
Why?

09:26.431 --> 09:29.137
I... don't need to know.

09:30.841 --> 09:32.276
And I'll keep it
between us?

09:32.276 --> 09:35.617
Because I trust
your judgment.

09:37.253 --> 09:39.324
Total mind‐meld.

09:44.769 --> 09:46.338
(grunts)

09:51.415 --> 09:54.722
Hey, if you want
to get a good slide,

09:54.722 --> 09:56.058
back up right through there,

09:56.058 --> 09:57.795
and when you come in,
hit the brakes,

09:57.795 --> 09:58.697
and <i>then</i> kick it around.

10:04.374 --> 10:06.311
Hey! There you go.

10:06.311 --> 10:07.815
Thanks, mister.

10:07.815 --> 10:10.453
Oh, I... I wouldn't call me
a m‐mister.

10:10.453 --> 10:12.858
I mean, you're probably
more mature than I am, so...

10:12.858 --> 10:14.094
Then what should I call you?

10:14.094 --> 10:15.897
Well...
WOMAN:
Trouble.

10:15.897 --> 10:18.202
(chuckles):
No way.

10:19.437 --> 10:20.974
Martin Riggs.

10:21.843 --> 10:23.278
Hey, Molly.

10:23.278 --> 10:26.351
<i>Molly Hendricks, an L. A. girl.</i>

10:26.351 --> 10:29.057
Good Lord Almighty,
I guess you live long enough,

10:29.057 --> 10:30.894
you'll just see everything,
won't you?

10:30.894 --> 10:32.330
(laughs):
Oh, yeah.

10:32.330 --> 10:35.069
Like Martin Riggs
being an L. A. boy.

10:35.069 --> 10:36.906
You take up
surfing yet?

10:36.906 --> 10:38.543
You know, I'm still trying
to perfect rollerblading.

10:38.543 --> 10:39.612
You know, I'm so happy

10:39.612 --> 10:41.983
that you haven't lost
your sense of humor, you know?

10:41.983 --> 10:42.985
Now, your looks...

10:42.985 --> 10:45.156
Mm‐hmm! You better be careful,

10:45.156 --> 10:47.995
because Ben already has
one parent in jail.

10:47.995 --> 10:49.497
♪ All right ♪

10:49.497 --> 10:51.502
♪ Are you really all right? ♪

10:51.502 --> 10:53.338
About that...
(clears throat)

10:53.338 --> 10:54.307
What?

10:54.307 --> 10:56.478
What are you doing here, Martin?

10:57.915 --> 11:00.252
Jake was paroled yesterday.

11:01.989 --> 11:04.127
Son of a bitch.

11:04.127 --> 11:06.198
And he didn't call.

11:06.198 --> 11:08.402
Should know
better by now.

11:08.402 --> 11:12.878
I just wish some day
he'd get his life together.

11:12.878 --> 11:14.480
Like you did.

11:14.480 --> 11:16.384
Oh.

11:16.384 --> 11:18.155
(laughs)

11:18.155 --> 11:20.392
A part of me still can't believe
you're a cop.

11:20.392 --> 11:23.833
Yeah.
The way you and Jake
carried on when we were kids.

11:23.833 --> 11:26.104
Sometimes I wonder what
the 12‐year‐old Martin would say

11:26.104 --> 11:27.574
if he saw me now, you know?

11:27.574 --> 11:30.513
He'd probably kick me
in the groin, take off running.

11:36.491 --> 11:38.328
Molly, I'm gonna
need you to call me

11:38.328 --> 11:39.497
as soon as you hear from Jake.

11:39.497 --> 11:42.604
He's already gone and done
something stupid, hasn't he?

11:42.604 --> 11:45.276
That's why
you're here.

11:45.276 --> 11:47.213
I don't know.

11:47.213 --> 11:48.950
But I need to talk to him.

11:48.950 --> 11:51.622
(phone ringing)

11:51.622 --> 11:54.060
One second.

11:54.060 --> 11:56.331
Hey.
MURTAUGH:
The numbers on Kenny's hands

11:56.331 --> 11:59.103
connects him to a woman
named Molly Hendricks.

11:59.103 --> 12:03.478
She's the girlfriend of
his old cellmate, a Jake Voss.

12:03.478 --> 12:04.915
Check this out.

12:04.915 --> 12:06.251
He was paroled yesterday, too.

12:06.251 --> 12:10.426
Meet me at Molly's‐‐
1411 Paul Terrace.

12:10.426 --> 12:13.800
You know, funny,
I am actually, uh, close by.

12:16.939 --> 12:18.375
(phone beeps off)

12:18.375 --> 12:21.448
Well, hey, brother.
What are you doing?

12:21.448 --> 12:23.853
Looking for you.

12:25.356 --> 12:27.426
Jake!
(engine starts)

12:27.426 --> 12:28.629
Jake!
(tires screeching)

12:28.629 --> 12:30.099
Hey! Hey!

12:31.101 --> 12:33.005
(groans)
(engine starts)

12:33.005 --> 12:37.346
(engines revving)

12:40.920 --> 12:45.229
(tires squealing)

12:54.180 --> 12:56.351
(car horn blaring)

12:58.689 --> 13:00.894
(car horn blaring)

13:04.568 --> 13:06.872
(tires squealing,
engine revving)

13:12.249 --> 13:15.489
(tires squealing,
siren blaring)

13:19.063 --> 13:20.399
(horn blaring)

13:23.171 --> 13:24.440
(horn blares)

13:31.387 --> 13:35.295
(tires squealing)

13:43.011 --> 13:45.182
(groans)
Did you kill that man?

13:45.182 --> 13:47.253
No. Come on, man.
Look at me, Jake!

13:47.253 --> 13:49.023
God almighty,
did you kill that man?!

13:49.023 --> 13:51.427
No. No!

13:51.427 --> 13:54.333
You know I wouldn't
do this. Let me go.

13:58.576 --> 14:00.279
(panting)

14:00.279 --> 14:01.481
You owe me.

14:01.481 --> 14:04.253
(panting)

14:04.253 --> 14:07.159
You better not go far.

14:07.159 --> 14:09.531
Thank you.

14:12.169 --> 14:13.706
Okay.

14:13.706 --> 14:14.708
(engine starts)

14:14.708 --> 14:17.479
(tires squealing)

14:19.317 --> 14:21.655
(siren chirping)

14:23.659 --> 14:24.661
(tires squeak)

14:24.661 --> 14:25.730
Hey.

14:25.730 --> 14:28.168
(distant sirens)

14:28.168 --> 14:29.705
Why did you let him go?!

14:29.705 --> 14:32.544
You know that friend
I had mentioned?

14:32.544 --> 14:34.514
You just missed him.
(siren chirps)

14:39.457 --> 14:42.463
AVERY:
Listen up, everybody.
The suspect's name is

14:42.463 --> 14:43.666
Jake Voss,

14:43.666 --> 14:46.104
and he has quite
the rap sheet.

14:46.104 --> 14:48.609
Where to begin?
At, uh, 12, he...

14:48.609 --> 14:50.078
(whispering):
I'm not comfortable.

14:50.078 --> 14:51.214
...youthful
shoplifting thing,

14:51.214 --> 14:52.416
went straight
to pulling grand theft auto.

14:52.416 --> 14:54.220
Don't touch my settings.
By the time

14:54.220 --> 14:55.389
he was 16, he'd begun
an illustrious...

14:55.389 --> 14:58.529
I said I'm not comfortable
with you letting a murderer go.

14:58.529 --> 15:02.504
Well, Jake's not a murderer,
okay?

15:02.504 --> 15:04.373
Stupid, yes,
but he's not a killer.

15:04.373 --> 15:06.512
And I thought getting
to know one of your friends

15:06.512 --> 15:07.714
would help me
understand you better.

15:07.714 --> 15:10.052
Yeah, well,
you were wrong.
Yeah, I was.

15:10.052 --> 15:13.391
Let's go get him.
Everybody back to work.

15:13.391 --> 15:14.594
(groans)

15:14.594 --> 15:16.130
Hey.

15:16.130 --> 15:17.266
Where you going?

15:17.266 --> 15:19.103
I'm gonna
go talk to Jake.

15:19.103 --> 15:21.742
By yourself?
Man, come on.

15:21.742 --> 15:25.616
Look, Rog, it's better
this way... for both of us.

15:25.616 --> 15:27.486
It's unbelievable.

15:27.486 --> 15:29.658
You trust that
convict more than me?

15:29.658 --> 15:31.528
No.

15:31.528 --> 15:35.335
Roger, it's just
complicated, okay?

15:35.335 --> 15:38.408
You know what? Tell me,
what do you owe this dude?

15:39.644 --> 15:41.648
Okay, I understand
there was a history,

15:41.648 --> 15:44.654
but do you actually
believe that he's innocent?

15:44.654 --> 15:46.859
Do you?
I do.

15:46.859 --> 15:49.698
And if... and if he did it,
are you gonna bust him?

15:49.698 --> 15:53.672
I'll even let you
read him his rights. Come on.

15:55.743 --> 15:58.448
(siren wailing in distance)

16:04.293 --> 16:06.197
(car door bell dinging)

16:06.197 --> 16:09.236
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Who's this guy?

16:09.236 --> 16:10.840
Just relax, all right?
This is Roger,

16:10.840 --> 16:12.644
my partner.
He's cool.

16:12.644 --> 16:14.614
What's up, Roger?

16:14.614 --> 16:15.850
It's illegal

16:15.850 --> 16:17.787
to drink alcohol
in public.

16:17.787 --> 16:19.724
I thought you said
he was cool?

16:19.724 --> 16:21.562
I lied. Start talking.

16:21.562 --> 16:24.133
All right,
so Kenny and I are sitting

16:24.133 --> 16:25.536
in our parole officer's
waiting room.

16:25.536 --> 16:28.308
Tells me he's got a line
on a big money score.

16:28.308 --> 16:30.278
How could I say no?
Easy.

16:30.278 --> 16:32.784
You just say no.
(clears throat)
Continue.

16:32.784 --> 16:35.790
I was just the driver. Is it
really a crime to be a driver?

16:35.790 --> 16:37.226
Yes, it's illegal,

16:37.226 --> 16:38.829
especially
when you're

16:38.829 --> 16:40.165
a getaway driver.

16:40.165 --> 16:41.400
Now where's the gold?

16:41.400 --> 16:43.772
You think if I had it,
I'd still be in town?

16:43.772 --> 16:45.877
Somebody else was there,
somebody not in on the score.

16:45.877 --> 16:46.778
Did you see who it was?

16:46.778 --> 16:48.582
No. He must've come
through the back.

16:48.582 --> 16:52.256
I mean, I heard a gunshot,
I panicked and drove off.

16:52.256 --> 16:53.726
Hey, Riggs,

16:53.726 --> 16:55.630
you find that third guy,
you'll find your murderer.

16:56.732 --> 16:57.867
Come here.

16:57.867 --> 16:59.704
We only did

16:59.704 --> 17:01.675
a forensic search in the
front of the house, all right?

17:01.675 --> 17:04.280
Let's go back, let's do
a full perimeter search.

17:04.280 --> 17:05.448
Then that way,
we can rule it...

17:05.448 --> 17:08.522
Are you buying this?
A third guy?

17:08.522 --> 17:09.824
What was it,
the bogeyman?
Bogey... Stop it.

17:09.824 --> 17:11.562
(phone chiming)
Come on. He's lying.

17:11.562 --> 17:13.632
What do you mean? How...? We
don't know he's lying and...

17:13.632 --> 17:15.168
Uh‐oh.

17:15.168 --> 17:16.605
It's Avery.

17:16.605 --> 17:18.709
I think he's pissed.
What made you say that?

17:18.709 --> 17:20.546
He says, "Get the duck
back to the office."

17:20.546 --> 17:22.416
Oh. Well, you better
get the duck back then.

17:22.416 --> 17:24.186
Look, stay with him, okay?

17:24.186 --> 17:25.556
I don't want him going
into the system

17:25.556 --> 17:27.426
until I know
exactly what's going on.

17:27.426 --> 17:30.398
And, hey, you‐‐
try not to do anything stupid.

17:30.398 --> 17:31.868
Yes, sir, Officer.

17:31.868 --> 17:34.874
(sighs)

17:34.874 --> 17:37.346
Uh...
Your country cousin

17:37.346 --> 17:39.551
may trust you, but I
sure as hell don't.

17:40.853 --> 17:42.222
Let's go.

17:42.222 --> 17:45.428
(garbled radio transmission)

17:46.364 --> 17:48.267
(indistinct chatter)

17:48.267 --> 17:51.474
You're supposed to search the
crime scene, not contaminate it.

17:51.474 --> 17:54.313
I'm sorry. Bailey, can we
just talk about...?
Shut up.

17:54.313 --> 17:56.217
I'm working,

17:56.217 --> 17:57.119
and you should
be working, too.

17:57.119 --> 17:59.658
I'll find something
to clean this up.

18:02.362 --> 18:04.834
Um, what is going on
with you two?

18:04.834 --> 18:06.470
Nothing.

18:07.439 --> 18:10.746
We had a situation last night.

18:10.746 --> 18:12.750
Situation?

18:12.750 --> 18:14.353
Whoa. Did you two...?

18:14.353 --> 18:16.223
Sleep together? No. No.

18:16.925 --> 18:20.231
I accidentally sent him a sext.

18:20.966 --> 18:22.904
(quietly):
What?

18:22.904 --> 18:25.810
And before I could tell Bowman
it was an accident,

18:25.810 --> 18:27.814
he rejected me.

18:27.814 --> 18:31.220
(scoffs)
What an idiot.

18:31.220 --> 18:32.322
'Cause you're...
Hey.

18:32.322 --> 18:33.525
Uh,

18:33.525 --> 18:34.861
SID found a hair
by the back door.

18:34.861 --> 18:35.963
Might be from the killer.

18:35.963 --> 18:38.267
Analyze it.

18:41.273 --> 18:42.342
Now.

18:42.342 --> 18:44.413
Yeah. Got it.

18:45.816 --> 18:48.287
(clears throat)

18:48.287 --> 18:49.456
Hey, Cap.

18:49.456 --> 18:51.327
Riggs, meet Robert McCoy.

18:51.327 --> 18:52.530
He was the parole officer

18:52.530 --> 18:54.299
assigned to both
Kenny Stokes

18:54.299 --> 18:55.803
and Jake Voss.
Thought he might

18:55.803 --> 18:57.540
have some ideas
of where to find Jake.

18:57.540 --> 18:58.942
Why don't you tell him
what you told me?

18:58.942 --> 19:02.282
That I'd start my search
with the police detective

19:02.282 --> 19:03.919
who spoke at Jake's
parole hearing.

19:03.919 --> 19:05.088
Right.

19:05.088 --> 19:07.259
Why the hell didn't you
tell me you knew the suspect?

19:07.259 --> 19:08.929
Well, in fairness,
you never asked.

19:08.929 --> 19:11.400
And I know a lot of people.
You know, I know the Murtaughs,

19:11.400 --> 19:12.537
I know you,
and now Mr. McCoy here.

19:12.537 --> 19:14.439
I'm gonna write a list,
like a compile of all the names

19:14.439 --> 19:15.709
of people I...
Riggs?

19:15.709 --> 19:16.711
(clears throat)

19:16.711 --> 19:20.485
Can you give us
the room, please?

19:26.631 --> 19:30.305
This is a copy of the
juvenile court records

19:30.305 --> 19:31.875
for your friend.

19:31.875 --> 19:33.044
Those records are sealed.

19:33.044 --> 19:35.549
I unsealed them.
I read what

19:35.549 --> 19:36.718
he did for you,
and understand

19:36.718 --> 19:38.421
why you might feel
indebted to him.

19:38.421 --> 19:41.327
And that's why I'm gonna
cut you some slack.

19:41.327 --> 19:43.699
Do you know where Jake is?

19:43.699 --> 19:46.003
Not a clue.

19:46.003 --> 19:48.842
(clears throat)
(door opens)

19:48.842 --> 19:51.413
MURTAUGH:
<i>So you and Riggs</i>
<i>stole a car, huh?</i>

19:51.413 --> 19:53.484
(laughs)
We were just borrowing it.

19:53.484 --> 19:55.890
(laughs)
At 13?

19:55.890 --> 19:57.526
My partner was

19:57.526 --> 19:58.929
a juvenile delinquent.

19:58.929 --> 20:00.599
Unbelievable.

20:00.599 --> 20:02.469
And now he's a cop.

20:02.469 --> 20:03.872
Mm‐hmm.

20:03.872 --> 20:05.375
Well, be honest with me.

20:05.375 --> 20:06.945
He any good at it?

20:06.945 --> 20:08.515
Yeah.

20:08.515 --> 20:10.385
He's pretty good.

20:10.385 --> 20:11.888
I can believe that, actually.

20:11.888 --> 20:16.497
Riggs kept me out of a lot
of trouble when we were kids.

20:16.497 --> 20:18.100
Got me into my fair share, too.

20:18.100 --> 20:19.570
It's just hard to imagine

20:19.570 --> 20:22.375
what my life would be like
if I hadn't met him.

20:22.375 --> 20:24.714
What does he owe you?

20:27.954 --> 20:30.526
Hey, check it out!

20:30.526 --> 20:32.162
There's a crime in progress.

20:32.162 --> 20:35.101
(tires squealing, thudding)

20:35.101 --> 20:36.538
(groans)

20:40.445 --> 20:41.915
(panting)

20:41.915 --> 20:43.184
Keys.

20:43.184 --> 20:46.725
There.

20:46.725 --> 20:48.461
You're making a huge mistake.

20:48.461 --> 20:50.098
Won't be my first.

20:50.098 --> 20:51.467
(sighs)

20:51.467 --> 20:54.574
All right,
cuff yourself to the wheel.

21:00.586 --> 21:02.455
I owe you a taco.

21:03.391 --> 21:05.495
(car door closes)

21:12.442 --> 21:14.847
Hey, buddy.
You all right?

21:14.847 --> 21:16.818
You need to get
some new friends.

21:16.818 --> 21:19.791
All right, look,

21:19.791 --> 21:23.464
you have to know that
Jake was completely aware

21:23.464 --> 21:25.435
of the airbags
and anticipated...

21:25.435 --> 21:28.441
He pointed my gun at my head.

21:28.441 --> 21:29.677
But he didn't shoot you.

21:29.677 --> 21:30.679
(scoffs)
Right?

21:30.679 --> 21:31.748
SCORSESE:
Rumor was

21:31.748 --> 21:33.150
you were dead, Murtaugh.

21:33.150 --> 21:35.188
But I knew better. Mind‐meld.

21:35.188 --> 21:36.724
All right,
what do you got?

21:36.724 --> 21:39.096
We found a hair
near the back door of the house.

21:39.096 --> 21:40.164
Guess what.

21:40.164 --> 21:41.233
DNA match

21:41.233 --> 21:42.703
to Jake.

21:43.605 --> 21:45.509
What?

21:45.509 --> 21:47.212
It can't be.

21:47.212 --> 21:48.782
Tested it twice.
It's his.

21:48.782 --> 21:50.819
You see? He lied, Riggs.

21:50.819 --> 21:52.523
And if he lied about that,
then he probably lied

21:52.523 --> 21:54.727
about everything else.

21:55.996 --> 21:57.666
(groans)

21:59.537 --> 22:00.706
By the way,

22:00.706 --> 22:02.743
also got the results
back on those hairs

22:02.743 --> 22:05.549
you wanted tested
for... marijuana.

22:05.549 --> 22:07.051
Which one came back positive?

22:07.051 --> 22:09.790
The short one or the long one
with the leave‐in conditioner?

22:09.790 --> 22:12.596
Neither.
They're both clean.

22:12.596 --> 22:14.867
But if it's not RJ's
and it's not Riana's,

22:14.867 --> 22:17.038
then it would have to be...

22:17.038 --> 22:18.073
Who?

22:18.073 --> 22:19.877
Trish.

22:19.877 --> 22:21.915
Ugh.

22:29.997 --> 22:32.202
Hey.

22:32.202 --> 22:34.674
This doesn't make any sense.

22:34.674 --> 22:36.511
The drill didn't even
crack through the lock.

22:36.511 --> 22:38.214
It didn't even make it
through the back.

22:38.214 --> 22:41.086
Then how did
Kenny open it?

22:41.086 --> 22:42.222
He didn't.

22:42.222 --> 22:44.660
It's a decoy.

22:44.660 --> 22:46.096
Kenny must have knew
the combination

22:46.096 --> 22:46.931
before he walked in here.

22:46.931 --> 22:50.238
So the burglary
was an inside job.

22:50.238 --> 22:52.041
Huh.

22:52.041 --> 22:53.578
Nice work, partner.

22:54.246 --> 22:56.584
(rubber gloves snap)

23:03.732 --> 23:05.234
(door closes)

23:05.234 --> 23:06.537
(Murtaugh groans)

23:06.537 --> 23:09.910
(sighing):
What a day.

23:09.910 --> 23:11.547
Oh, baby.

23:11.547 --> 23:13.718
How's your head, huh?
(groans)

23:13.718 --> 23:15.021
You want me to
get you something?

23:15.021 --> 23:17.760
(sighs)
You know...
Hmm?

23:17.760 --> 23:19.864
I think, uh...

23:19.864 --> 23:22.870
what I need is
just to relax.

23:22.870 --> 23:24.740
You know? Take
the edge off.

23:24.740 --> 23:27.312
Ooh. That's exactly
what I was thinking.

23:27.312 --> 23:28.848
Yeah.
(laughs)

23:28.848 --> 23:30.251
You know, I mean, we can
do something together.

23:30.251 --> 23:32.021
Okay.
Something fun.

23:32.021 --> 23:33.792
Mm‐hmm.
A little dangerous.

23:33.792 --> 23:37.065
Perhaps even...
a little illegal.

23:37.065 --> 23:39.135
Illegal?
(laughs)

23:39.135 --> 23:40.972
(laughing):
Okay, what do
you have in mind?

23:40.972 --> 23:44.613
I don't know. Maybe
we can, you know...

23:46.584 --> 23:48.588
(both laugh)

23:48.588 --> 23:50.157
Yeah.
A joint?

23:50.157 --> 23:51.728
Yeah.
Oh, my God.

23:51.728 --> 23:53.263
How hard did you
hit your head?

23:53.263 --> 23:55.736
As hard as you've been
hitting this marijuana.

23:55.736 --> 23:57.906
(laughs)

23:57.906 --> 23:59.109
Roger, what are you
talking about?

23:59.109 --> 24:00.746
No, no, no, no.
Come on, now.

24:00.746 --> 24:02.248
You are too smart
to play dumb.

24:02.248 --> 24:04.219
I found this in the house.

24:04.219 --> 24:05.589
And I drug‐tested the kids,

24:05.589 --> 24:07.893
so I know it's not theirs.

24:07.893 --> 24:10.264
You drug‐tested our children?

24:10.264 --> 24:11.934
Look, look, look,
I'm not mad.

24:11.934 --> 24:14.339
It's obvious that you
have a drug problem.

24:14.339 --> 24:17.880
Okay? Because pot,

24:17.880 --> 24:20.017
at least for the
next few months or so,

24:20.017 --> 24:22.321
in the state of
California, is illegal.

24:22.321 --> 24:24.192
Okay. And I'm a cop.

24:24.192 --> 24:26.029
Which makes this a problem.

24:26.029 --> 24:30.271
Mm‐hmm. You know what?
The only problem here is you.

24:30.271 --> 24:33.645
This isn't my joint, Roger.

24:33.645 --> 24:36.684
And I don't appreciate
you accusing me.

24:36.684 --> 24:37.820
Take it.

24:37.820 --> 24:39.924
Okay. Well, if it's not yours,

24:39.924 --> 24:42.328
then who does this belong to?

24:42.328 --> 24:45.201
Mmm, I don't know,

24:45.201 --> 24:48.675
perhaps someone with the
proclivity for getting high,

24:48.675 --> 24:53.183
who is in our home
all the time, Roger.

24:53.183 --> 24:55.221
Riggs.
Riggs.

You know what?
You're right.
Hmm.

24:57.325 --> 24:58.695
I'm sorry.
Really? Oh, yeah.

24:58.695 --> 25:00.197
Look. Hey, you don't
have to relax me,

25:00.197 --> 25:01.834
I'll relax you.
Let me...
Oh.

25:01.834 --> 25:03.203
You know what,

Hmm?

25:03.203 --> 25:06.777
You relax yourself.

25:06.777 --> 25:09.115

Yeah.

29:49.609 --> 29:51.279
Sorry.

29:51.279 --> 29:52.682
Obviously, I knew
it wasn't for me.

29:52.682 --> 29:54.118
Well, if that's the case,
then why did you text me,

29:54.118 --> 29:55.153
"Let's just be friends"?

29:55.153 --> 29:57.458
It was a joke.

29:57.458 --> 30:00.063
I'd heard you mention you'd been
seeing someone.

30:00.063 --> 30:01.432
I figured it was for him or her.

30:01.432 --> 30:03.036
Him.
Great.

30:03.036 --> 30:04.171
Great.

30:04.171 --> 30:06.042
Shut up, Bowman.

30:06.042 --> 30:07.579
Really.

30:07.579 --> 30:10.952
I'm sorry. I just don't want
things to be awkward between us.

30:10.952 --> 30:13.089
Too late for that.

30:14.458 --> 30:16.195
Hey, come here.

30:16.195 --> 30:18.066
Mm‐hmm.

30:21.072 --> 30:22.709
Lay down with me.

30:22.709 --> 30:24.378
Mm‐hmm.

30:28.052 --> 30:29.455
Look.

30:31.325 --> 30:33.429
Oh.

30:33.429 --> 30:35.668
BAILEY:
Our theory is that he's
eavesdropping on the parolees.

30:35.668 --> 30:37.639
And then piggybacks
off their scores.

30:37.639 --> 30:39.643
RIGGS:
Okay, so Jake and Kenny

30:39.643 --> 30:41.547
talk about the job
in the parole office,

30:41.547 --> 30:44.151
McCoy eavesdrops,
beats them to the score.

30:44.151 --> 30:46.088
Hmm.

30:46.088 --> 30:50.163
Well, now, what does
that mean for us, Roger?

30:50.163 --> 30:51.567
Come on. I don't...

30:51.567 --> 30:53.671
Oh, no, no, no, no. Go ahead.
I‐I'm not gonna,

30:53.671 --> 30:55.307
I'm not gonna say
"I told you so," just...

30:55.307 --> 30:57.612
Okay, means your buddy Jake
is not the killer.

30:57.612 --> 30:58.814
I told you so.

30:58.814 --> 31:01.185
All right.
(clears throat)

31:01.185 --> 31:02.421
Okay. So does McCoy
have the gold?

31:02.421 --> 31:03.624
Why wouldn't he just lay low?

31:03.624 --> 31:05.427
I mean, if he had the gold,
why would he go after Jake?

31:05.427 --> 31:07.030
Maybe Jake has the gold.

31:07.030 --> 31:08.433
Nah, he'd be sipping
piña coladas by now.

31:08.433 --> 31:10.103
What if he stashed it?

31:10.103 --> 31:13.142
Couldn't get to it yet.

31:13.142 --> 31:14.245
But where?

31:14.245 --> 31:16.015
It's not in the house.

31:25.601 --> 31:27.805
You mind if I take her
for a spin?

31:27.805 --> 31:31.178
(engine revs, tires squeal)

31:36.757 --> 31:39.596
(engine revs)

31:50.483 --> 31:51.720
(whoops)

31:51.720 --> 31:54.626
Ain't you a sight
for sore eyes.

31:56.697 --> 31:58.166
Are you still pissed at me?

32:00.504 --> 32:01.740
I take it that's the gold

32:01.740 --> 32:03.276
that you thought
was worth bringing

32:03.276 --> 32:04.746
all this chaos
into our life.

32:04.746 --> 32:06.282
Oh, don't give me that, baby.

32:06.282 --> 32:08.119
Come on, let me see those pretty
brown eyes of yours.

32:13.363 --> 32:14.699
Where's Ben?

32:14.699 --> 32:16.068
Come on.

32:16.068 --> 32:17.003
You really thought

32:17.003 --> 32:20.711
I was gonna take our son
on the run with you?

32:20.711 --> 32:22.648
Never gonna happen.

32:22.648 --> 32:25.788
I'm sorry, Jake,
this ends here.

32:26.723 --> 32:30.330
Molly, what have you done?

32:31.733 --> 32:33.670
RIGGS:
Don't blame her, Jake.

32:33.670 --> 32:34.739
It's on me, buddy.

32:34.739 --> 32:36.208
MURTAUGH:
And me.

32:36.208 --> 32:37.244
Remember me?

32:37.244 --> 32:39.314
I came for the tacos you owe me.

32:39.314 --> 32:40.684
Oh, so that's it.

32:40.684 --> 32:42.254
You're gonna take me away
from my lady

32:42.254 --> 32:43.590
and my son.

32:43.590 --> 32:44.692
You did this, Jake.

32:45.594 --> 32:46.730
<i>You</i> did.

32:47.832 --> 32:50.403
Riggs, I‐I didn't shoot Kenny.

32:50.403 --> 32:51.573
I don't know who did,
but it wasn't me,

32:51.573 --> 32:53.443
and you know that.
Look, we know
you didn't kill him.

32:55.146 --> 32:56.683
Jake, I got to take you in
for the gold, man.

32:56.683 --> 32:58.486
I‐I get it.

32:59.756 --> 33:01.358
You think that debt's been paid.

33:08.473 --> 33:10.109
I owe you everything.

33:11.412 --> 33:12.849
But I don't have a choice.

33:12.849 --> 33:14.384
I've got to take you in.

33:17.123 --> 33:18.660
(bystanders screaming)

33:18.660 --> 33:20.096
MURTAUGH:
It's McCoy.

33:21.432 --> 33:22.300
I got him.

33:23.637 --> 33:25.206
Come on. Come on.

33:26.308 --> 33:28.346
Stupid idiot.

33:44.879 --> 33:46.482
You're an idiot.
Man, what were you thinking,

33:46.482 --> 33:47.284
coming back for the gold?

33:47.284 --> 33:49.421
I wanted
to give something to Ben.

33:49.421 --> 33:50.824
I wanted to be a father.

33:50.824 --> 33:52.427
Better than the daddies we had.

33:56.770 --> 33:58.874
You ever get out of jail,

33:58.874 --> 34:01.278
at least you know
where the parole office is.

34:01.278 --> 34:03.517
Listen to me.

34:03.517 --> 34:05.754
I'll talk to the D. A.

34:05.754 --> 34:06.923
All right?

34:06.923 --> 34:08.527
You'll do three years, tops.

34:08.527 --> 34:10.330
I can't go back to prison.

34:10.330 --> 34:11.298
I won't make it.

34:11.298 --> 34:13.503
NATHAN: <i>Boy!</i>
(gunshot)

34:18.714 --> 34:20.551
Okay.

34:20.551 --> 34:23.189
Okay... okay what?

34:25.628 --> 34:28.132
(indistinct radio chatter)

34:33.610 --> 34:35.514
If I ever see you again,

34:35.514 --> 34:38.520
you're gonna spend the rest
of your life in prison.

34:38.520 --> 34:40.758
What?
What are you talking about?

34:41.893 --> 34:44.632
Come on. Hit me.

34:44.632 --> 34:46.235
Can't...

34:46.235 --> 34:47.237
Hit me.

34:48.540 --> 34:49.976
Harder! Hit me!

34:49.976 --> 34:52.447
(Riggs and Jake scream)

34:59.729 --> 35:01.231
The gold stays.

35:06.475 --> 35:08.479
M‐Molly?

35:12.855 --> 35:15.426
Okay.

35:15.426 --> 35:17.497
All right.

35:29.722 --> 35:31.826
(siren wailing)

35:36.870 --> 35:39.876
(siren wailing)

35:43.850 --> 35:45.954
(indistinct radio chatter)

35:52.433 --> 35:54.004
Riggs, why'd you
let this guy go?

35:54.004 --> 35:55.874
Oh, I... I got winded.

35:55.874 --> 35:57.778
You know, I think I need
to do more calisthenics

35:57.778 --> 36:00.049
or, you know, get some exercise.
No, you let him go.

36:00.049 --> 36:01.953
Work on the core.

36:01.953 --> 36:04.959
You want to tell me
what you owe that dude?

36:07.932 --> 36:10.637
Okay. You know what? Hey.

36:10.637 --> 36:12.641
Forget it. Do me a favor.

36:12.641 --> 36:14.010
Anything, Rog. You name it.

36:14.010 --> 36:15.914
Don't introduce me
to no more of your friends.

36:15.914 --> 36:18.920
Well, that's easy.

36:18.920 --> 36:21.693
Only have one friend left.

36:21.693 --> 36:23.429
He's a great guy.
He lives in Texas.

36:23.429 --> 36:24.665
He's in the oil business,
but I think

36:24.665 --> 36:25.968
you'd like him. You know, you...
You know what?

36:25.968 --> 36:29.307
How about no more friends?

36:29.307 --> 36:30.376
Oh, Rog.

36:30.376 --> 36:31.946
I'm just kidding.
Come on, you know I love you.

36:37.758 --> 36:39.394
So, that's it? You just let
the bad guy get away?

36:39.394 --> 36:40.764
Yep, Jake is on the run.

36:40.764 --> 36:42.768
But, uh, I take offense
to "bad guy."

36:42.768 --> 36:45.039
He's got a great sense of humor.
Well, I just got word

36:45.039 --> 36:46.809
that he ditched
his Lamborghini in San Diego.

36:46.809 --> 36:48.546
Do you think
he's going to Mexico?

36:48.546 --> 36:49.381
Perhaps.

36:49.381 --> 36:51.385
Or maybe it's a decoy.

36:51.385 --> 36:53.022
I just... Fugitives, right?

36:53.022 --> 36:54.090
(laughs)
Riggs.

36:54.090 --> 36:55.661
You will tell me

36:55.661 --> 36:57.598
if and when you hear from him.

36:57.598 --> 36:58.767
Right?

36:59.936 --> 37:02.073
You'll be the first call I make.

37:06.549 --> 37:08.252
Um...

37:09.989 --> 37:12.493
(clears throat)

37:12.493 --> 37:15.333
Listen, not a lot of people
know about...

37:15.333 --> 37:17.470
what happened with my father.

37:18.840 --> 37:22.046
So I would appreciate it
if there's any way we could...

37:22.046 --> 37:23.550
Know about what?

37:26.789 --> 37:28.827
(door opens)

37:30.096 --> 37:32.835
(singsongy):
I figured it out.

37:33.937 --> 37:35.941
What's that?

37:35.941 --> 37:37.410
What Jake has on you.

37:37.410 --> 37:39.915
I know
all about your first kiss.

37:39.915 --> 37:42.120
Mary Ann DeLeon.

37:42.120 --> 37:43.957
(laughs)

37:43.957 --> 37:45.961
You got bad intel, Rog.

Cool. Right? We cool. We cool.
We cool. We cool.
We got to be cool.

41:25.967 --> 41:27.069
How many did you take?

41:27.069 --> 41:28.806
About 15.

41:32.279 --> 41:34.751
How long has
he been sitting there?

41:34.751 --> 41:36.354
An hour. Maybe more.

41:43.034 --> 41:44.972
Hey, amigo.

41:46.040 --> 41:48.111
Hey, Riggs.

41:48.111 --> 41:50.382
Yeah.

41:50.382 --> 41:52.152
How you feel, bud?

41:52.152 --> 41:54.257
I feel...

41:54.257 --> 41:55.727
vivid.

41:55.727 --> 41:58.699
(laughing)
All right. Yeah.

42:01.805 --> 42:04.110
Well, perfect, buddy.
Let's start...

42:04.110 --> 42:05.914
let's...

42:05.914 --> 42:07.918
let's start
with one of these guys, right?

42:07.918 --> 42:09.655
Oh, man.

42:09.655 --> 42:11.124
Hey, you have any
Allman Brothers?
(sighs)

42:11.124 --> 42:11.959
Almond butter? No.

42:11.959 --> 42:14.096
Maybe in the kitchen
there's almond...

42:14.096 --> 42:15.198
Not almond butter.

42:15.198 --> 42:16.301
You know what, forget it.

42:16.301 --> 42:17.303
It's okay.
Oh.

42:17.303 --> 42:19.140
Yeah. Speaking of, though,

42:19.140 --> 42:20.977
how about some snacks?

42:26.689 --> 42:27.691
What are you doing? Oh, Riggs.

42:27.691 --> 42:29.126
Who are you?

42:29.126 --> 42:31.164
Buddy, buddy, buddy, buddy.
What?

42:31.164 --> 42:33.234
Oh, snap.

42:33.234 --> 42:35.272
What are you made of?

42:35.272 --> 42:38.879
(laughing):
We got cheese?

42:38.879 --> 42:40.048
Cheese.

42:40.048 --> 42:41.885
Now cracker.

42:41.885 --> 42:44.123
Okay.
What am I...

42:44.123 --> 42:45.827
There you go. Put
the cracker in.

42:45.827 --> 42:47.897
Right?
Uh‐huh.

42:49.033 --> 42:51.471
I don't know.
Mm‐hmm.

42:51.471 --> 42:52.774
Mmm.

42:52.774 --> 42:56.180
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.

42:56.180 --> 42:58.218
Man.

42:58.218 --> 42:59.921
The velvety cheese...

42:59.921 --> 43:01.491
Mixed with the salty cracker.
Oh.

43:01.491 --> 43:02.794
Yeah.
Okay?

43:02.794 --> 43:04.998
Thank you, Riggs.
Mm‐hmm.

43:06.100 --> 43:07.737
Mmm.

43:07.737 --> 43:10.142
Oh, the sound
is blowing my mind.

43:10.142 --> 43:12.112
Hey, Riggs.

43:12.112 --> 43:14.417
Hmm?

43:14.417 --> 43:16.755
Finally get you, man.

43:16.755 --> 43:19.728
Welcome to my world, Rog.
