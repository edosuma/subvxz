WEBVTT

00:13.972 --> 00:16.474
Ugh.
There's never anything on TV.

00:16.558 --> 00:18.601
-Hey, everyone.
-What's up?

00:18.685 --> 00:21.229
Hey, Claire.
When does your sister get here?

00:21.312 --> 00:24.274
I wanna change
into something a little less blah.

00:24.357 --> 00:27.027
-She'll be here any minute.
-Oh. So I have time.

00:27.944 --> 00:30.613
You guys are gonna love Chelsea.
She's like a genius.

00:30.697 --> 00:33.158
She's been in college since high school.

00:33.742 --> 00:35.243
Guest room is ready.

00:35.326 --> 00:39.456
I removed the stale energy with a crystal
and the carpet stain with a Tide pen.

00:40.040 --> 00:43.668
Thanks, Solana. I can't wait!
Chelsea's moving to L.A. I'm so excited.

00:43.752 --> 00:47.464
If you're excited, I'm excited.
And that's really exciting.

00:47.547 --> 00:49.340
I don't wanna overwhelm her.

00:49.424 --> 00:52.093
She's staying for a few days
until her boyfriend meets her.

00:52.177 --> 00:53.553
Boyfriends are so slow.

00:53.636 --> 00:57.223
When our parents separated, Chelsea and I
grew apart, and ever since then,

00:57.307 --> 00:59.517
being close to her
is all I've ever wanted.

00:59.601 --> 01:01.061
It's so important to dream.

01:01.144 --> 01:02.771
And now is our chance

01:02.854 --> 01:06.691
to finally connect and become
sister best friends forever.

01:06.775 --> 01:07.776
SBFFs.

01:08.943 --> 01:09.861
She's here!

01:09.944 --> 01:12.322
Already? No, no, no, I haven't changed!

01:14.866 --> 01:17.285
-Chelsea!
-Hi. Whoa.

01:17.994 --> 01:20.205
I missed you too.

01:21.539 --> 01:24.250
Come in! Come in! Make yourself at home.

01:24.334 --> 01:26.920
Thank you again for letting me stay here.

01:27.003 --> 01:28.379
Of course, Chelsea.

01:28.463 --> 01:29.964
It really is so generous.

01:30.048 --> 01:34.469
I bought you a Victorian tea kettle
as a token of my appreciation.

01:34.552 --> 01:37.180
But it broke into a thousand pieces
during my flight.

01:37.263 --> 01:41.309
So I got you
this I Heart L.A. Traffic mug,

01:42.644 --> 01:44.604
which I'm told is microwave-safe.

01:47.273 --> 01:48.525
It's beautiful.

01:51.569 --> 01:55.365
-Wow, your house is amazing.
-Yeah. We got a great deal

01:55.448 --> 01:58.118
because we're subletting
from the subletter's house sitter.

01:59.202 --> 02:01.246
Chelsea, look at what I got.

02:01.955 --> 02:04.707
It's a puffy paint T-shirt making station!

02:04.791 --> 02:07.502
Oh, I didn't know
you were still babysitting.

02:08.378 --> 02:10.213
Oh, no, it's for us.

02:11.673 --> 02:15.426
We can decorate them and write our names
on them just like when we were kids.

02:16.010 --> 02:17.804
Oh, that's sweet.

02:17.887 --> 02:22.016
I find I wear T-shirts emblazoned
with my name across it less these days.

02:23.726 --> 02:27.480
Right. Right.
It's stupid. We don't have to.

02:27.564 --> 02:29.732
-Come meet everyone.
-Okay.

02:30.316 --> 02:32.694
-Hi.
-Chelsea, this is Grant.

02:32.777 --> 02:35.905
He's a personal trainer. We used to date,
but we had a mutual breakup.

02:35.989 --> 02:38.241
-So now we're roommates.
-How French.

02:38.324 --> 02:39.617
Actually Nebraska.

02:40.618 --> 02:41.870
Nebraska, U.S.A.

02:43.663 --> 02:47.167
-It's so great to meet you.
-Oh, wow, you're very shirtless.

02:47.667 --> 02:49.210
And hard.

02:50.587 --> 02:52.422
No. That's just its resting size.

02:54.591 --> 02:58.970
This is Solana. She used to be a lawyer,
but she quit to become a healer.

02:59.053 --> 03:01.222
Oh. That's a time-tested career shift.

03:01.806 --> 03:05.977
So happy to share physical space with you.

03:06.561 --> 03:09.314
I'm sensing you feel uncomfortable.

03:10.899 --> 03:11.733
You're good.

03:12.901 --> 03:15.320
I'm gonna make you
a garlic turmeric lemon shot.

03:15.403 --> 03:17.572
-That's really not necessary.
-You'll drink it.

03:17.655 --> 03:18.740
Okay.

03:19.616 --> 03:22.744
-This must be Claire's sister.
-That's me.

03:25.288 --> 03:28.416
It is so wonderful
for you to finally meet me.

03:29.459 --> 03:31.127
Jayden Jay J. Michael Jiang,

03:31.628 --> 03:35.465
but you probably know me by my handle
@JaydenJayJMichaelJiang.

03:36.049 --> 03:39.552
-Jayden's an influencer.
-Oh, cool.

03:40.053 --> 03:42.013
I'm actually not on social media.

03:42.513 --> 03:45.558
What--? Then how do you see
how many likes you got?

03:47.018 --> 03:48.436
That's a good one.

03:49.312 --> 03:50.563
Oh, you weren't...?

03:53.024 --> 03:54.651
Oh, my God, Claire.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.862
They're all just like you.

03:57.946 --> 03:59.697
Aw. Thanks, sis!

04:02.700 --> 04:08.831
Wow, I am so glad you have this guest room
because I am just beat after that flight.

04:09.791 --> 04:11.834
Yeah. You must be.

04:13.294 --> 04:14.128
So...

04:15.630 --> 04:18.258
So hop in.

04:19.592 --> 04:20.635
Okay.

04:21.719 --> 04:23.388
-Oh, oh, sorry.

04:23.471 --> 04:24.681
We've gotta fix that.

04:24.764 --> 04:26.182
I heard wobbling.

04:28.268 --> 04:31.062
-Pretend I'm not here.
-Thanks, Grant.

04:31.145 --> 04:32.605
Okay, so, what should we do?

04:32.689 --> 04:37.360
-Um, let's play Truth or Dare.
-I'm sorry. I'm just really tired.

04:37.944 --> 04:40.196
-Of course. Of course.
-Yeah.

04:42.448 --> 04:45.618
-It's such a great way to catch up.
-Okay, one truth.

04:45.702 --> 04:46.911
Yay! Okay.

04:46.995 --> 04:49.539
Um, how did you meet your boyfriend?

04:50.248 --> 04:51.582
Oh, Dwayne.

04:53.042 --> 04:55.461
Well, it was my first day at my new class

04:55.545 --> 04:57.922
in 15th Century
Comparative South American Literature

04:58.006 --> 05:02.719
across Multiethnic Diasporic Migrations,
so obviously I was already excited.

05:04.637 --> 05:07.265
Excuse me. Do you want us
to get off the bed?

05:07.348 --> 05:08.558
Nope. I'm good.

05:08.641 --> 05:09.600
Going up.

05:11.269 --> 05:14.689
You were saying, your first day
in Diaper Migrant class?

05:14.772 --> 05:17.442
I'm sorry. Are we just gonna...
while he's...?

05:18.568 --> 05:21.279
Okay. So, Dwayne.

05:21.904 --> 05:25.283
Uh, I walk in, I sit down, and he enters.

05:25.783 --> 05:30.788
Tweed sport jacket, red turtleneck,
round, nearly invisible jawline.

05:32.040 --> 05:33.291
-Hot.
-Coming down.

05:34.751 --> 05:35.960
Yes. He's brilliant.

05:36.044 --> 05:40.381
I began assisting him in his Ph.D. thesis,
and we couldn't help but fall in love.

05:40.465 --> 05:41.591
Going up.

05:42.550 --> 05:44.844
So he's wonderful to you,
and he really gets you,

05:44.927 --> 05:47.305
and he makes you feel safe
to be yourself around him,

05:47.388 --> 05:49.974
and he supports you
in pursuing your dreams?

05:50.558 --> 05:51.642
Um...

05:52.310 --> 05:53.353
Yeah.

05:54.771 --> 05:58.066
I mean, up until this point,
I've mainly been helping his pursuits,

05:58.149 --> 06:00.818
but now that he's taken
a full-time position here at USC,

06:00.902 --> 06:03.696
he's going to support me
while I write my novel.

06:05.865 --> 06:11.120
Wow, listening to you two, it's like
you've been sisters your whole lives.

06:13.539 --> 06:15.291
Not the sharpest tool in the shed.

06:15.375 --> 06:18.294
Actually, it's a hammer.
It's not meant to be sharp.

06:18.378 --> 06:23.549
Besides, we don't have a shed.
Or do we, and I just never noticed?

06:25.468 --> 06:27.136
Catch you guys later.

06:29.806 --> 06:32.141
I cannot believe that I'm staying here.

06:33.601 --> 06:35.436
For three whole days.

06:35.937 --> 06:37.688
Three whole days.

06:38.189 --> 06:40.024
Okay, my turn. Truth.

06:40.650 --> 06:44.404
Have I told you about the time that I was
briefly the princess of Lichtenstein?

06:46.739 --> 06:49.325
And things just got
kind of stale with Evan.

06:49.409 --> 06:52.620
And all that initial passion
and excitement wore off,

06:52.703 --> 06:55.331
and we were left with nothing
but the same boring routines.

06:55.915 --> 07:00.670
-How long were you two together?
-Eleven days.

07:02.672 --> 07:05.133
Claire, I'm not gonna tell you this again.

07:05.216 --> 07:07.468
You gotta wait on your tables.

07:08.261 --> 07:11.931
Oops. I forgot. Thanks, Howard.

07:13.141 --> 07:16.310
Worst waitress we've ever had.

07:16.394 --> 07:18.938
-But the customers love her.
-Of course.

07:19.021 --> 07:24.777
Oh. What are you reading? I'm a bookworm
myself. An autodidact, if you will.

07:24.861 --> 07:28.781
Oh, fantastic. I have been yearning
for some stimulating discourse.

07:28.865 --> 07:31.868
It's Remembrance of Things Past,
his finest, don't you think?

07:32.869 --> 07:35.371
Actually, I haven't gotten
to that one yet.

07:35.455 --> 07:39.333
Right now I'm working my way
through a tremendous text.

07:39.417 --> 07:41.002
The Da Vinci Code.

07:41.586 --> 07:46.549
Lots of archeology, ancient religion
stuff. A lot of people don't get it.

07:46.632 --> 07:49.635
Anyway, I'll leave you to your book.

07:51.846 --> 07:53.639
Oh. Finally some quiet.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.058
Hey, it's Chelsea.

07:56.142 --> 07:58.269
-Hey.
-Hey.

07:58.352 --> 08:01.564
Chelsea, remember
how you mentioned the shed?

08:02.231 --> 08:04.567
Yes. It was a determinative experience.

08:05.651 --> 08:10.698
Right. I triple-checked, and we don't
have a shed. It's really weighing on me.

08:11.407 --> 08:14.494
Oh. Grant, that was an off-handed comment.

08:14.577 --> 08:18.206
-I didn't meant for it to be a thing.
-No. I'm glad you said something.

08:18.289 --> 08:20.833
It all comes back to the fact
that my father got mad

08:20.917 --> 08:22.668
if I didn't put away my toys.

08:22.752 --> 08:25.338
So I used to just shove them
under the bed,

08:25.838 --> 08:28.841
which is exactly where I keep my tools.

08:29.342 --> 08:34.096
I got mostly smaller stuff now.
A hammer, wrench, pliers.

08:34.889 --> 08:37.517
What if I get a lawn mower?
It'll have nowhere to go.

08:39.227 --> 08:40.645
It's just a real bummer.

08:42.104 --> 08:45.650
Sweetie, I get it.
My mom used to get mad at me too.

08:45.733 --> 08:47.276
She'd say, "Smile big.

08:47.360 --> 08:51.155
The Tucson Mall fashion show is
a launching pad for regional print work."

08:53.699 --> 08:55.451
I have to take this.

08:56.035 --> 08:58.204
Dwayne, thank God.

08:59.455 --> 09:03.584
I can't be around these people.
My brain is starting to liquefy.

09:03.668 --> 09:06.254
Can you move your flight up a day? What?

09:07.421 --> 09:08.256
What is it?

09:08.923 --> 09:12.051
Tenure track at Harvard? Oh, my God.

09:12.134 --> 09:15.388
Congratulations, honeydew.
This is everything we've ever wanted.

09:15.471 --> 09:20.101
I'll get on a plane as soon as possible.
I can't wait of get out of-- What?

09:20.685 --> 09:23.437
Sorry, I ordered
the seasonal vegetable salad,

09:23.521 --> 09:25.064
and this is a giant steak.

09:26.566 --> 09:29.610
Shoot, I always get those two confused.

09:30.194 --> 09:32.905
Hey, how did your job interview go
last week?

09:32.989 --> 09:36.617
Oh. I can't believe you remembered.
I actually got it.

09:36.701 --> 09:38.077
Oh, that's amazing.

09:38.160 --> 09:41.581
That's so good to hear.
Okay, let's get this order right.

09:41.664 --> 09:42.623
You know what?

09:42.707 --> 09:45.835
I've been vegan for nine years.
I could use the iron.

09:53.551 --> 09:54.802
I just got dumped.

09:56.512 --> 09:57.513
By Dwayne.

09:58.264 --> 10:00.349
"The Rock" Johnson?

10:07.690 --> 10:11.193
He wants to embark
on this new chapter with a clean slate.

10:11.277 --> 10:14.697
This whole time, he was using me
for my female perspective

10:14.780 --> 10:17.700
on Garcilaso de la Vega's ahistoricism!

10:18.326 --> 10:20.077
It's so obvious!

10:21.203 --> 10:24.373
Screw that guy.
For real, he doesn't deserve you.

10:25.750 --> 10:28.919
I don't know what I'm gonna do now.
I just graduated.

10:29.003 --> 10:33.007
I have no money, no career,
no place to live.

10:33.591 --> 10:36.218
I don't why I'm packing. I can't go back.

10:36.302 --> 10:38.346
I can't show my face
at the Cambridge Common.

10:38.429 --> 10:42.433
-I'd be a pariah of the intelligentsia!
-You're nothing like a piranha.

10:43.476 --> 10:46.687
Piranhas are vicious
and impossible to get close to.

10:47.605 --> 10:49.273
Maybe you are like a piranha.

10:50.274 --> 10:53.944
-But in a good way.
-This is just not how it's supposed to be.

10:54.028 --> 10:55.863
It's just-- It's not how--

10:55.946 --> 10:58.532
-When I first--
-Hey, hey! It's okay.

10:58.616 --> 11:02.453
We should think of this as a blessing.
We get rid of Dwayne, and--

11:03.245 --> 11:04.955
-And you can live with me.
-Claire--

11:05.039 --> 11:08.000
No, it's perfect!
We've only just begun our SBFF bonding.

11:08.084 --> 11:12.296
And I'm an expert at the post-breakup
ritual. We can eat pizza and drink wine.

11:12.380 --> 11:15.049
We can watch The Princess Diaries 2!

11:15.132 --> 11:19.345
Will you stop? None of those things
sound even remotely appealing.

11:20.346 --> 11:22.056
I was just trying to be nice.

11:22.682 --> 11:26.310
Yeah, well, it's easy to be nice
when things go your way.

11:26.394 --> 11:30.064
You live in this alternate universe
where everything's easy

11:30.147 --> 11:33.693
and everyone falls in love with you,
and vegans eat steak.

11:33.776 --> 11:36.737
Meanwhile,
I have been toiling my whole life

11:36.821 --> 11:39.532
-for every inch of my academic success.

11:39.615 --> 11:42.576
-Oh, yeah. Yeah.
-Is that--?

11:42.660 --> 11:45.663
That's Grant having sex.
Don't change the subject.

11:46.539 --> 11:50.918
It's not my fault that I'm nice
and that people like me.

11:52.712 --> 11:56.048
Have you ever noticed how hard I work?

11:56.549 --> 11:58.259
I've had a job since I was 16

11:58.342 --> 12:01.345
while Mom and Dad let you do
whatever you wanted!

12:01.429 --> 12:03.639
I couldn't have a job in high school.

12:03.723 --> 12:06.392
The literary criticism
debate team traveled.

12:06.475 --> 12:09.478
-Oh, yeah. Yeah, here we go!

12:09.562 --> 12:11.063
What is he doing in there?

12:12.398 --> 12:14.692
When you chose to stay with me,

12:15.401 --> 12:19.321
I thought, "Wow, Chelsea and I
are finally going to connect."

12:20.489 --> 12:22.491
I didn't choose to stay with you.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.994
I tried everyone I knew in L.A.
before calling you.

12:25.077 --> 12:28.164
I mean, this is the last place
that I want to be,

12:28.247 --> 12:30.541
as you people would say, "Literally."

12:38.174 --> 12:40.843
Do you know why I wanted to make
puffy paint shirts?

12:44.430 --> 12:47.641
Because the last time we did that
was my 7th birthday.

12:48.976 --> 12:51.937
It's my favorite memory of us.

12:53.481 --> 12:56.192
It's the way it used to be
before you started ignoring me.

12:58.402 --> 13:02.823
You probably don't even,
as you people would say, "Recall."

13:05.451 --> 13:06.368
Claire...

13:07.953 --> 13:11.081
-You don't understand.
-No, don't tell me what I understand.

13:11.165 --> 13:13.542
You think I'm dumb, but I'm not.

13:13.626 --> 13:17.630
And look around you.
I have a job, I have a place to live,

13:17.713 --> 13:19.757
and I have a life that I love.

13:20.257 --> 13:21.383
What do you have?

13:28.808 --> 13:30.810
Wow, thank you.

13:30.893 --> 13:34.271
Yeah, that was amazing, truly.

13:34.355 --> 13:35.981
I'm proud of all of us.

13:38.692 --> 13:39.610
Hoo!

13:41.487 --> 13:44.323
You just never know who you're gonna meet
at the grocery store.

13:48.410 --> 13:50.079
Uh-huh. Okay.

13:50.162 --> 13:53.499
Well, I would love to take the place
for a month, if that's okay.

13:53.582 --> 13:57.253
And as for rent,
I don't have the money, per se,

13:57.336 --> 14:00.381
but I can make up for it
in free Latin lessons.

14:02.049 --> 14:03.008
Hello?

14:03.592 --> 14:04.552
Hello?

14:08.931 --> 14:11.058
There's something I want you to see.

14:11.141 --> 14:13.602
Your glutes popping
after those lunges I showed you?

14:13.686 --> 14:15.729
No, something else. Follow me.

14:15.813 --> 14:18.274
But you're right. They really are.

14:18.357 --> 14:20.317
Okay, close your eyes.

14:20.401 --> 14:22.236
Follow me. You can come too, boo-boo.

14:22.319 --> 14:23.904
Okay, keep them closed.

14:23.988 --> 14:26.365
Okay. I saw how sad you were

14:26.448 --> 14:29.451
about not having a shed for a minute
before your threesome,

14:30.119 --> 14:32.830
so I bought you one.

14:35.165 --> 14:36.000
What?

14:36.083 --> 14:40.170
The guy at the store, who, by the way,
looked like Paul Giamatti, yum.

14:40.254 --> 14:41.422
Clearly obsessed with me.

14:41.505 --> 14:43.883
He said this is the biggest one they have.

14:45.175 --> 14:47.011
I have the best friends.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.098
And the best shed.

14:51.807 --> 14:53.017
Love you, Grant.

14:53.100 --> 14:54.310
I love you too, man.

14:54.393 --> 14:55.477
Quick pic.

14:58.147 --> 15:01.108
Ooh, yay. I picked this shed color
based on my skin tone...

15:01.984 --> 15:03.027
and it's working.

15:07.573 --> 15:10.826
-I can't believe he bought you a shed.
-Your friends would do the same.

15:11.785 --> 15:14.580
No, I don't think
anyone would buy me a shed.

15:15.247 --> 15:16.832
For a myriad of reasons.

15:19.627 --> 15:20.794
You okay?

15:22.087 --> 15:26.884
Oh. Yeah, I mean,
it's just that I have nowhere to go,

15:26.967 --> 15:30.930
and no one to turn to
because no one wants me.

15:31.013 --> 15:32.973
I am basically a social piranha.

15:34.099 --> 15:35.601
Oh, God, it's contagious.

15:37.102 --> 15:38.062
You know...

15:39.188 --> 15:40.064
it's funny.

15:40.689 --> 15:43.108
I was really bummed
about not having a shed.

15:43.192 --> 15:45.694
And then I had sex with Jane and Tiffany.

15:45.778 --> 15:46.987
And I still felt bummed.

15:48.364 --> 15:51.992
Really? Because it sounded like
you were riding Splash Mountain in there.

15:54.078 --> 15:55.579
And now I have a shed.

15:55.663 --> 15:58.540
And don't get me wrong,
having a shed is awesome.

15:59.041 --> 16:02.711
But it's not the shed that matters.
It's the tools inside it.

16:07.049 --> 16:11.303
Are you teaching me a lesson
through the rhetorical device of metaphor?

16:12.054 --> 16:13.180
I don't know.

16:15.432 --> 16:19.812
Because if you are, and tools are friends,

16:19.895 --> 16:24.441
and sheds are the socially constructed
expectations of success,

16:25.109 --> 16:30.072
then I have been wasting my time
focusing on sheds instead of tools.

16:32.199 --> 16:34.201
Wow, Grant, that's actually really wise.

16:36.412 --> 16:37.454
Thank you.

16:38.038 --> 16:38.956
Anytime.

16:40.082 --> 16:40.916
Really.

16:48.882 --> 16:51.635
Okay. Let's see, needs more...

16:54.930 --> 16:56.140
Hi.

16:56.223 --> 16:57.182
Hi.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.521
Wait, Claire.

17:04.440 --> 17:05.274
Um...

17:07.901 --> 17:09.361
On your 7th birthday,

17:10.154 --> 17:12.406
we made puffy paint shirts.

17:12.489 --> 17:14.908
And yours said "Claire" in bright pink.

17:15.492 --> 17:17.703
And you spilled Cheeto dust all over it.

17:18.579 --> 17:20.247
You do recall!

17:20.998 --> 17:23.167
Yeah. You were crying, you were so upset.

17:23.250 --> 17:27.087
And then you put Cheeto dust
all over yours to make me feel better.

17:27.171 --> 17:28.005
Yeah.

17:28.088 --> 17:29.965
You were so sweet back then.

17:33.427 --> 17:34.845
So why'd you stop?

17:36.138 --> 17:37.222
What did I do wrong?

17:38.599 --> 17:39.600
Oh.

17:40.100 --> 17:41.685
No, no, I mean, it--

17:42.686 --> 17:44.146
It wasn't you.

17:44.813 --> 17:45.856
Um...

17:47.107 --> 17:49.735
Do you remember after the divorce,

17:50.360 --> 17:52.780
when Dad used to call
all the time and ask for me?

17:52.863 --> 17:55.240
Yeah. He always liked you more.

17:56.408 --> 17:58.452
He wasn't calling to talk to me.

17:58.535 --> 18:01.663
He was calling to tell me
what to tell Mom.

18:01.747 --> 18:05.250
And then she'd complain about Dad,
and I'd have to interpret it back to him.

18:05.918 --> 18:07.419
They really put me in the middle.

18:07.503 --> 18:08.796
Like Malcolm.

18:11.090 --> 18:16.178
I pulled away because I wanted
to protect you from all their petty crap.

18:16.261 --> 18:19.223
And I didn't really know
how else to do it.

18:21.391 --> 18:23.102
I had no idea.

18:24.770 --> 18:26.313
Let me show you something.

18:31.527 --> 18:33.612
I was trying to match the original.

18:37.449 --> 18:38.450
Chelsea.

18:39.076 --> 18:39.952
Oh.

18:40.994 --> 18:43.413
Oh, I really did miss you.

18:48.460 --> 18:49.503
I missed you too.

19:00.305 --> 19:01.140
Ooh.

19:01.807 --> 19:02.850
What is that stuff?

19:02.933 --> 19:06.728
It's hibiscus and dandelion root
to clear the toxins.

19:06.812 --> 19:07.771
Oh.

19:08.397 --> 19:09.314
Is it working?

19:10.858 --> 19:11.692
No.

19:13.318 --> 19:15.988
Look, I just wanna say
thank you to all of you

19:16.071 --> 19:17.573
for letting me live here.

19:17.656 --> 19:20.325
I've never been a tool before.

19:21.535 --> 19:24.621
And it was a great idea
turning the shed into a hang zone.

19:24.705 --> 19:26.415
Now it's a shedroom.

19:28.542 --> 19:30.669
'Cause shedroom sounds like bedroom.

19:31.378 --> 19:33.505
-That is so cool.
-I love that!

19:34.923 --> 19:35.883
That is so cute!

19:35.966 --> 19:38.594
I'm gonna make popcorn.
Does anyone want some?

19:38.677 --> 19:39.928
-Yes.
-Sure.

19:40.929 --> 19:44.683
And, Chels, we're gonna have to
get you on Insta, right? Yeah, it's time.

19:44.766 --> 19:47.853
Oh, you know what?
Again, it's really not for me.

19:47.936 --> 19:51.690
I'm of the emerging perspective
that social media creates

19:51.773 --> 19:53.567
a paradigm of vapidness.

19:54.484 --> 19:57.571
I am too. Of that. Uh, too.

20:01.783 --> 20:03.410
You're on social media, aren't you?

20:03.493 --> 20:04.661
What? No, I'm not.

20:04.745 --> 20:06.788
It's okay. I can keep a secret.

20:08.707 --> 20:11.501
Okay, fine. I'm addicted to Instagram.
I can't stop.

20:11.585 --> 20:13.837
And I'm a huge Jayden Jay J.
Michael Jiang fan.

20:13.921 --> 20:15.589
I almost freaked out when I met him.

20:15.672 --> 20:17.633
He's the reason
I bought this plant-based lip balm.

20:17.716 --> 20:21.553
He said it would make my lips as soft
as a baby's bottom. And he was right.

20:22.262 --> 20:24.848
Please don't tell anybody, okay?
It's my guilty pleasure.

20:25.515 --> 20:27.643
Why would you feel guilty
about a pleasure?

20:29.519 --> 20:30.479
Oh.

20:31.146 --> 20:32.981
I never thought of it that way.

20:35.192 --> 20:36.652
Can I tell you a secret?

20:38.654 --> 20:39.905
Sure.

20:40.822 --> 20:42.950
I'm really looking forward
to getting closer to you.

20:44.660 --> 20:47.579
You wanna get close to me?

20:48.455 --> 20:49.665
Of course.

20:50.415 --> 20:53.794
I wanna be close
to the woman I love's... sister.

20:54.503 --> 20:56.296
-I'm sorry, did you say "sister"?
-Yeah.

20:57.089 --> 21:00.717
Claire. I'm talking about Claire.
Your sister, Claire.

21:00.801 --> 21:02.135
-Yeah.
-I'm in love with Claire.

21:02.219 --> 21:03.136
I got it.

21:03.971 --> 21:06.390
Um, I just thought the breakup was mutual.

21:06.473 --> 21:07.933
It was, but only for Claire.

21:09.351 --> 21:12.187
-Popcorn. Extra sugar.
-Yes!

21:12.271 --> 21:14.648
Okay, Chels. House rule:

21:14.731 --> 21:18.652
You can't eat popcorn
unless someone throws it in your mouth.

21:18.735 --> 21:20.404
Yes!

21:21.405 --> 21:23.198
-That was so good!
-Grant.

21:23.282 --> 21:24.700
Solana.

21:25.867 --> 21:27.869
Screw it. Hit me.
