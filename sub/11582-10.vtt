(male announcer)
In the criminal
justice system,

00:02.103 --> 00:03.037
sexually based offenses

00:03.071 --> 00:06.774
are considered
especially heinous.

00:06.807 --> 00:09.477
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:09.510 --> 00:11.312
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:11.345 --> 00:12.780
are members of an elite squad

00:12.813 --> 00:14.648
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:14.682 --> 00:16.284
These are their stories.

00:19.153 --> 00:20.488
(Fin)
Sun's up.

00:20.521 --> 00:22.723
This freak doesn't hit
after dawn.

00:22.756 --> 00:24.425
You wanna call it a night?

00:24.458 --> 00:26.194
Yeah.
One long ass night.

00:28.529 --> 00:30.364
You know what?
Bodega's open.

00:30.398 --> 00:32.133
You want another cup of coffee?

00:32.166 --> 00:34.302
No, I'll get it.
You call Elliot.

00:34.335 --> 00:35.636
Thanks.

00:35.669 --> 00:39.807
Mobile One to Base.
Mobile One to Base.

00:39.840 --> 00:42.343
(Elliot)
Base here.

00:42.376 --> 00:44.478
Hey, I think
we're gonna pack it in.

00:44.512 --> 00:45.479
Good, see you
back at the house.

00:45.513 --> 00:48.316
75...

00:48.349 --> 00:50.318
Gimme two coffees,
one black, one regular.

00:50.351 --> 00:51.319
You got it.

00:51.352 --> 00:52.853
(boy)
A dollar fifty.

00:52.886 --> 00:54.688
A dollar seventy-five.

00:54.722 --> 00:56.090
Two dollars.

00:56.124 --> 00:58.226
Two dollars and 25.

01:08.902 --> 01:11.372
Empty out the register, pops.

01:11.405 --> 01:12.806
You think I'm playing?

01:16.477 --> 01:18.479
[gunshot]

01:18.512 --> 01:19.813
[continuous gunshots]

01:19.847 --> 01:22.283
Shots fired--
Bodega at the corner

01:22.316 --> 01:23.884
of 115th and Lexington.

01:23.917 --> 01:28.189
Ten thirteen!
Ten thirteen!

01:28.222 --> 01:31.425
Be advised plainclothes
detectives on scene.

01:34.395 --> 01:35.596
Police!

01:42.936 --> 01:44.405
Fin.

01:44.438 --> 01:45.806
Fin!

01:45.839 --> 01:47.908
My partner's been hit.
I need a BUS now.

01:47.941 --> 01:51.245
Fin. Fin.
My God.

01:51.279 --> 01:52.546
(radio)
Copy that.
All units are responding.

01:52.580 --> 01:54.114
You okay?
You stay down.

01:56.350 --> 01:58.652
Fin, you all right?
Stay with me.

01:58.686 --> 01:59.853
Stay with me, Fin.

01:59.887 --> 02:02.290
Stay with me, baby.
Stay with me.

02:56.677 --> 02:58.479
G.S.W. left upper thorax.
Copious blood loss.

02:58.512 --> 02:59.980
Gave him two liters
en route.
Vitals?

03:00.013 --> 03:01.449
B.P. 70 over palp,
pulse is thready.

03:01.482 --> 03:02.916
G.C.S. five,
responds to pain.

03:02.950 --> 03:03.917
What does that mean?

03:03.951 --> 03:05.686
He's in shock
from the blood loss.

03:05.719 --> 03:06.754
Bullet hit an artery.
We've gotta get him to the O.R.

03:06.787 --> 03:08.522
But he's gonna
make it, right?

03:08.556 --> 03:09.690
Soon as I know anything,
I'll tell you.

03:16.029 --> 03:18.266
Liv.
How is he?

03:18.299 --> 03:20.000
They won't tell me.
He's going into surgery now.

03:20.033 --> 03:22.436
I didn't see the perps go in.
That's all right.

03:22.470 --> 03:23.737
How many times have you gone in
for a cup of coffee

03:23.771 --> 03:25.639
I didn't have your back, huh?
It's all right.

03:25.673 --> 03:26.874
(Munch)
What went down in that store?

03:26.907 --> 03:28.342
I don't know.

03:28.376 --> 03:30.411
When I walked in,
Fin was already unconscious.

03:30.444 --> 03:32.313
The shooter and the bodega guy
were all DOA.

03:32.346 --> 03:34.715
This little kid survived.

03:34.748 --> 03:35.716
What did the kid say?

03:35.749 --> 03:36.884
He didn't see a thing.

03:36.917 --> 03:38.319
Fin got between him
and the gunman.

03:38.352 --> 03:40.020
Let's make sure
that's what happened.

03:40.053 --> 03:42.356
Head over to the scene, work
with CSU and the shooting team.

03:42.390 --> 03:43.891
(Munch)
Captain, I'd rather stay here.

03:43.924 --> 03:45.693
All right, fine, I'll go.

03:45.726 --> 03:47.828
You notify Fin's next of kin.

03:47.861 --> 03:50.598
Only family he's ever mentioned
is a son.

03:50.631 --> 03:51.865
Head back to the squad.

03:51.899 --> 03:55.736
His contact information
is on his ten card.

03:55.769 --> 03:58.005
And get changed.

04:04.745 --> 04:06.480
[knocking on door]

04:10.318 --> 04:11.619
Can I help you?

04:11.652 --> 04:13.921
Are you Kwasi Tutuola?

04:13.954 --> 04:17.658
I'm Ken Randall.
I use my mom's name.

04:17.691 --> 04:18.992
No one calls me Kwasi except--

04:19.026 --> 04:21.495
Your dad?

04:21.529 --> 04:25.633
You work with Fin.

04:25.666 --> 04:28.369
I'm Detective Olivia Benson.

04:28.402 --> 04:31.372
What happened?

04:31.405 --> 04:36.644
There was a shooting,
and your father was injured.

04:36.677 --> 04:38.346
He's in surgery right now,

04:38.379 --> 04:41.582
and I'd be happy
to take you to the hospital.

04:41.615 --> 04:42.750
Did he ask for me?

04:42.783 --> 04:46.019
He's unconscious.

04:52.092 --> 04:55.596
It's been a long time
since I've seen him.

04:55.629 --> 04:58.466
We're not exactly close.

04:58.499 --> 05:00.868
You're the only one
listed as his next of kin.

05:00.901 --> 05:05.373
And, uh, I think
he'd want you there.

05:08.942 --> 05:10.911
Captain Cragen, is it true
Detective Tutuola shot

05:10.944 --> 05:12.613
an unarmed kid?
No comment.

05:12.646 --> 05:15.549
Come on, you've got two dead
boys and only one gun was found.

05:15.583 --> 05:16.850
Did he kill an innocent
bystander?
No comment.

05:16.884 --> 05:18.686
Think they're gonna make
this a bad shoot.

05:22.890 --> 05:25.726
Press is saying
one of the kids was unarmed.

05:25.759 --> 05:26.594
Tell me they're wrong.

05:26.627 --> 05:27.761
Don't know yet.

05:27.795 --> 05:29.563
We recovered this MAC-10.

05:29.597 --> 05:31.465
Punk number one over there
emptied the clip.

05:31.499 --> 05:33.066
You know, Fin's lucky
he wasn't a better shot.

05:33.100 --> 05:34.568
Where's the other shooter's gun?

05:34.602 --> 05:36.904
Can't find one.

05:36.937 --> 05:39.807
(woman)
How's Fin?

05:39.840 --> 05:41.575
There's no word.
What do you got?

05:41.609 --> 05:42.443
Too soon to say.

05:42.476 --> 05:44.378
We're just starting
the reconstruction.

05:44.412 --> 05:45.746
(Stabler)
Well, tell us
what you got so far.

05:45.779 --> 05:46.847
Guy at the register
was shot twice.

05:46.880 --> 05:47.881
Once in the right hand

05:47.915 --> 05:49.750
and once in the head.
By who?

05:49.783 --> 05:52.420
Our friend here
with the MAC 10.

05:52.453 --> 05:54.588
We figure he started it off.

05:54.622 --> 05:56.490
He sprayed the area
from left to right.

05:56.524 --> 05:59.793
See where the rest
of the rounds hit.

05:59.827 --> 06:01.962
Okay, what happened next?

06:01.995 --> 06:03.497
The shooter takes one
to the chest.

06:03.531 --> 06:04.965
Based on
the blood spatter pattern,

06:04.998 --> 06:06.767
the bullet was fired
from over there.

06:06.800 --> 06:10.070
It's Fin's blood.

06:10.103 --> 06:13.574
(Cragen)
All right, so Fin takes out
the first guy.

06:13.607 --> 06:14.642
What about the other?

06:14.675 --> 06:15.943
(Siper)
Single shot to the heart.

06:15.976 --> 06:17.177
M.E. says it would've
killed him instantly.

06:17.210 --> 06:18.812
Could it have been

06:18.846 --> 06:22.115
a stray round
or a ricochet?

06:22.149 --> 06:23.116
I'm waiting for Ballistics,

06:23.150 --> 06:24.852
but based on the angle
of entry,

06:24.885 --> 06:26.887
I'm pretty sure
Fin shot him.

06:26.920 --> 06:28.622
There's no way Fin
would shoot an unarmed kid.

06:28.656 --> 06:30.190
He had to have been packing.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.159
That's why I did a gunshot
residue test on his hands.

06:32.192 --> 06:33.627
And?

06:33.661 --> 06:35.796
The kid didn't fire a gun.

06:35.829 --> 06:37.598
There's a possibility
he wasn't involved

06:37.631 --> 06:39.032
in the robbery.

06:44.638 --> 06:45.839
Media's gonna go crazy.

06:45.873 --> 06:47.608
Look, if Fin took out
that second kid,

06:47.641 --> 06:48.876
it's because he had to.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.611
And what makes you think
the press is gonna

06:50.644 --> 06:52.012
take our word for it?

06:52.045 --> 06:53.781
Hey, I got something.
The gun?

06:53.814 --> 06:55.182
Maybe better.

06:55.215 --> 06:57.485
Hidden security camera
on the back wall.

06:57.518 --> 06:58.986
Get the tape over to TARU
for enhancement.

06:59.019 --> 07:00.954
You stay here.
Find that gun.

07:00.988 --> 07:02.590
I'm going back
to the hospital.

07:05.626 --> 07:08.596
We'll have more information for
you when it becomes available.

07:08.629 --> 07:11.064
Thank you.

07:11.098 --> 07:12.833
Captain.

07:12.866 --> 07:14.702
Captain Cragen.

07:14.735 --> 07:15.836
How's Detective Tutuola?

07:15.869 --> 07:16.904
He's still in surgery, Chief.

07:16.937 --> 07:17.971
Those damn reporters.

07:18.005 --> 07:19.507
They're more interested
in the gun

07:19.540 --> 07:20.974
than a cop
fighting for his life.

07:21.008 --> 07:23.644
Vultures wanna crucify him.
Sir.

07:23.677 --> 07:25.178
(man)
Captain!

07:25.212 --> 07:27.014
You gotta see this.

07:27.047 --> 07:28.048
Let's go.

07:30.518 --> 07:32.486
Here's where the perps
enter the store.

07:40.227 --> 07:42.830
And the punk whips out
the MAC 10.

07:42.863 --> 07:44.898
I'm gonna slow it down.

07:48.135 --> 07:52.239
(Morales)
First shooter took out
the counterman.

07:52.272 --> 07:54.708
(Cragen)
Then Fin shoots
the little son of a bitch.

07:54.742 --> 07:56.744
Then he clips Fin.

07:56.777 --> 07:58.245
Watch the second guy.

07:58.278 --> 08:02.516
Fin waited until
he drew down.

08:02.550 --> 08:04.552
I enhanced the tape.

08:04.585 --> 08:07.888
Watch his hand as he falls.

08:07.921 --> 08:09.523
The gun flies over
the freezer case.

08:09.557 --> 08:10.724
I'm gonna call Elliot

08:10.758 --> 08:12.192
and tell him
where to find the gun.

08:12.225 --> 08:14.127
Grab the tape and follow me.

08:14.161 --> 08:15.629
I'm gonna
share this with the press.

08:15.663 --> 08:16.630
Keep me updated.

08:16.664 --> 08:17.698
Yes, sir.

08:17.731 --> 08:18.732
Stabler, please.

08:21.134 --> 08:24.137
Tell me it's good news, Doc.

08:24.171 --> 08:26.540
Detective Tutuola's
out of surgery.

08:26.574 --> 08:27.708
Bullet nicked an artery

08:27.741 --> 08:28.909
but missed the lung.

08:28.942 --> 08:30.110
Is he gonna be all right?

08:30.143 --> 08:32.846
He should make a full recovery.

08:35.983 --> 08:38.619
Thank you.

08:38.652 --> 08:40.220
[knock on door]

08:40.253 --> 08:43.090
Hey.

08:43.123 --> 08:46.960
Hey, Cap,
the boy in the store...

08:46.994 --> 08:48.729
Not a scratch on him.

08:51.632 --> 08:53.801
Man, I really screwed up.

08:53.834 --> 08:57.004
They shot that man in the bodega
before I could even pull my gun.

08:57.037 --> 08:59.607
Store had a security camera.
You did everything by the book.

08:59.640 --> 09:00.774
I shot two kids.

09:00.808 --> 09:01.909
Who were gonna kill you.

09:01.942 --> 09:04.044
And you saved an innocent child.

09:04.077 --> 09:06.013
[knocking]

09:06.046 --> 09:07.581
Hey.

09:07.615 --> 09:08.616
How you doing?

09:08.649 --> 09:11.885
I'm okay.

09:11.919 --> 09:13.921
Listen, half
the department's outside.

09:13.954 --> 09:15.022
You up for some company?

09:15.055 --> 09:17.124
Yeah, I guess.

09:17.157 --> 09:20.027
Why don't you come on in?

09:26.033 --> 09:27.167
Hey, Ken.

09:38.011 --> 09:39.246
You gonna be all right?

09:39.279 --> 09:40.981
I'm fine.

09:43.984 --> 09:45.786
I'm glad.

09:45.819 --> 09:46.820
Hey, can't you stay

09:46.854 --> 09:47.988
for a little while?

09:48.021 --> 09:50.991
Why? You're not dying.

09:51.024 --> 09:54.695
I don't blame you
for wanting to leave.

09:54.728 --> 09:56.997
I did a lotta that
when you were growing up.

09:57.030 --> 09:59.199
No big deal.

09:59.232 --> 10:00.167
Yes, it is.

10:00.200 --> 10:04.171
I can blame it on this job
or being undercover.

10:04.204 --> 10:07.775
But the bottom line is I put
my work ahead of my family.

10:10.911 --> 10:14.214
Don't worry.
I turned out okay.

10:16.349 --> 10:17.785
Take care, Dad.

10:37.137 --> 10:38.371
Hey, way to go, man.

10:38.405 --> 10:39.873
You drilled those guys.

10:42.309 --> 10:45.278
Hey, can I have your autograph,
Mr. Hero Cop?

10:45.312 --> 10:47.380
Hey, really, it's good
to have you back, man.

10:50.417 --> 10:52.119
(Cragen)
Come in.

10:57.958 --> 10:59.893
Department surgeon
said you could take the week.

10:59.927 --> 11:01.061
I'm not staying.

11:01.094 --> 11:03.130
I just need to get
some things outta my desk.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.865
And I wanted to show my face.

11:04.898 --> 11:07.367
How you feeling?
Fine.

11:07.400 --> 11:09.837
Hey Captain, those boys at
the bodega, how old were they?

11:09.870 --> 11:12.139
16.

11:14.474 --> 11:16.076
Look, if you need to talk,
you can always come--

11:16.109 --> 11:17.377
(woman)
I wanna talk to somebody
about him.

11:17.410 --> 11:19.146
Please calm down.
I know this guy.

11:19.179 --> 11:21.248
I've seen him before.
You can't go in there.

11:21.281 --> 11:23.316
I know he's no hero.
He's a dirty cop.

11:23.350 --> 11:25.318
(Munch)
Ma'am, I'm gonna
have to ask you to leave.

11:25.352 --> 11:27.220
I am not going anywhere till
I speak to someone in charge.

11:27.254 --> 11:29.089
I'm Captain Cragen.
Can I help you?

11:29.122 --> 11:30.457
The detective in the paper.

11:30.490 --> 11:33.160
I wanna make a complaint
about him.

11:38.265 --> 11:39.266
Remember me?

11:39.299 --> 11:41.168
No.

11:41.201 --> 11:42.870
I remember you.

11:42.903 --> 11:44.137
I could never forget your face.

11:44.171 --> 11:46.907
I just didn't know
your name until today.

11:46.940 --> 11:48.375
You put a gun to my head.

11:48.408 --> 11:50.778
There must be some mistake.

11:50.811 --> 11:51.478
Oh, no there's not.

11:53.246 --> 11:54.815
I'm Sandra Knowles.

11:57.217 --> 11:59.019
You're Tricia's mother.

11:59.052 --> 12:00.854
I wanted my daughter back home
where she belonged,

12:00.888 --> 12:01.989
not living
with that drug dealer.

12:02.022 --> 12:03.757
I was working undercover.

12:03.791 --> 12:06.093
Look, you put that pistol here
and said, "Leave, bitch,

12:06.126 --> 12:07.294
before I kill you."

12:07.327 --> 12:09.196
I had no choice.

12:09.229 --> 12:12.332
Oh, yes you did.

12:12.365 --> 12:14.134
You chose not to help my baby.

12:16.069 --> 12:18.038
Some hero.

12:32.552 --> 12:34.888
I thought you were going home.

12:34.922 --> 12:38.325
Just trying to handle
some unfinished business.

12:38.358 --> 12:41.061
Wouldn't be that woman
downstairs, would it?

12:41.094 --> 12:43.096
Yeah.

12:43.130 --> 12:45.298
Sandra Knowles.

12:45.332 --> 12:47.767
Whew. She takes me back.

12:51.404 --> 12:53.506
When I was working Narcotics,
it was all about

12:53.540 --> 12:55.342
getting the dope
off the street.

12:55.375 --> 12:57.310
We'd bust
any strung-out skell

12:57.344 --> 12:59.546
if it meant getting
to the guys at the top.

12:59.579 --> 13:01.849
There were no victims,
just dealers and users.

13:01.882 --> 13:04.952
Well, what happened
with Sandra's daughter?

13:04.985 --> 13:06.553
I was undercover.

13:06.586 --> 13:10.223
The target was a coke dealer
named Vance Dennis.

13:10.257 --> 13:12.592
I worked my way up
to bodyguarding him.

13:12.625 --> 13:16.263
His girlfriend
is a young kid from Yonkers.

13:16.296 --> 13:17.264
Tricia Knowles.

13:17.297 --> 13:19.099
Was she a runaway?

13:19.132 --> 13:20.433
Yeah, she was 18,

13:20.467 --> 13:22.002
and she didn't wanna go home.

13:22.035 --> 13:24.271
Had herself a nasty
coke habit too.

13:24.304 --> 13:26.373
So one day
Tricia's mother shows up

13:26.406 --> 13:28.441
and wants to see her daughter.

13:28.475 --> 13:30.577
Vance orders me
to make Moms go away.

13:30.610 --> 13:33.080
Well, you couldn't blow
your cover.

13:33.113 --> 13:34.281
I never felt right about it.

13:34.314 --> 13:36.549
Not a trace of Tricia Knowles
in the system.

13:36.583 --> 13:38.485
But your pal Vance Dennis
was easy to find.

13:38.518 --> 13:40.253
He's in Attica
doing a hard 20.

13:40.287 --> 13:41.288
When'd he go down?

13:41.321 --> 13:42.555
Last year Narcotics
raided his place

13:42.589 --> 13:44.357
and found 20 keys
of uncut coke.

13:44.391 --> 13:46.093
Were they acting on a tip?

13:46.126 --> 13:47.260
(Munch)
Yeah, an unnamed woman
inside Vance's house.

13:47.294 --> 13:49.529
That had to be Tricia.

13:49.562 --> 13:51.231
If she dimed Vance,
she's hiding out.

13:51.264 --> 13:53.333
You planning on finding her?

13:53.366 --> 13:54.534
I'm gonna go see Joey Bosco.

13:54.567 --> 13:57.004
He was my handler
when we worked on Vance.

13:57.037 --> 13:59.406
If he flipped Tricia,
he knows where she is.

13:59.439 --> 14:01.975
So you can talk her
into going back to Mom?

14:02.009 --> 14:03.143
It's been five years.

14:03.176 --> 14:06.313
That's a long time
not to see your kid.

14:06.346 --> 14:07.647
Maybe you should wait
till you're 100%.

14:07.680 --> 14:11.384
I think her mother's waited
long enough.

14:11.418 --> 14:14.354
Do what you gotta do.

14:14.387 --> 14:16.456
As far as I'm concerned,
you're still on leave.

14:22.329 --> 14:23.496
[camera clicking]

14:27.700 --> 14:29.269
Bosco.

14:29.302 --> 14:31.438
Fin.

14:31.471 --> 14:33.040
I heard about the shooting.

14:33.073 --> 14:35.408
I wanted to stop by,
but I hate hospitals.

14:35.442 --> 14:37.044
Me too.

14:37.077 --> 14:38.645
Someone shot me,
I'd be out on three-quarters,

14:38.678 --> 14:40.613
sipping Mai Tais on the beach.

14:40.647 --> 14:42.315
Yeah, but I got
some unfinished business.

14:42.349 --> 14:43.583
Remember Tricia Knowles?

14:43.616 --> 14:47.520
Vance Dennis' junkie
girlfriend.

14:47.554 --> 14:49.122
You flip her?

14:49.156 --> 14:52.692
After we pulled you out,
the case went dead

14:52.725 --> 14:54.661
until Tricia got picked up
muling coke in the JFK.

14:54.694 --> 14:57.397
What happened?
We didn't arrest her.

14:57.430 --> 14:58.231
Next shipment came in,

14:58.265 --> 15:02.169
she tipped us off,
and Vance went down.

15:02.202 --> 15:03.470
He know she turned him in?

15:03.503 --> 15:05.138
Probably guessed.

15:05.172 --> 15:07.474
You give her any kind
of relocation or protection?

15:07.507 --> 15:09.642
Patricia didn't want it.
Said she was going back home.

15:09.676 --> 15:12.312
Well, she didn't.

15:12.345 --> 15:14.314
I guess she changed her mind.

15:14.347 --> 15:15.648
The girl risked
her life for you,

15:15.682 --> 15:17.184
and you left her
out there all alone.

15:17.217 --> 15:19.486
Damn, Fin.

15:19.519 --> 15:21.288
Working in SVU's made you soft.

15:21.321 --> 15:22.622
You think
everyone's a victim?

15:22.655 --> 15:25.558
Tricia Knowles
was a cokehead.

15:25.592 --> 15:27.094
She ratted out her boyfriend.

15:27.127 --> 15:29.196
She made her choices.
She's gotta live with 'em.

15:29.229 --> 15:30.964
You have any idea
where she is?

15:30.998 --> 15:31.898
Not a clue.

15:31.931 --> 15:35.235
Vance is up in Attica.
Why don't you ask him?

15:43.043 --> 15:43.676
What's up, Vance?

15:47.014 --> 15:49.716
I liked you better
when you were Terry Brown.

15:49.749 --> 15:53.053
We had some fun
back in the day.

15:53.086 --> 15:54.721
But you didn't come here
to reminisce.

15:54.754 --> 15:56.589
Where's Tricia Knowles?
I don't know.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.291
When's the last time
you seen her?

15:58.325 --> 16:00.460
Beats me.

16:00.493 --> 16:02.529
One day she's shacked up
at my house,

16:02.562 --> 16:04.031
spending my dough,
doing my coke.

16:04.064 --> 16:06.333
The next I'm in here,
and she's in the wind.

16:06.366 --> 16:07.634
Makes you wonder.

16:07.667 --> 16:09.536
Sure does.

16:09.569 --> 16:12.305
Why you looking for her?

16:12.339 --> 16:15.242
'Cause I feel like it.

16:15.275 --> 16:17.710
That little coke whore
put me in here.

16:17.744 --> 16:20.680
How would I know
where she is or how she is?

16:20.713 --> 16:22.682
What's this?

16:22.715 --> 16:24.651
Think you're a big man now?

16:24.684 --> 16:26.219
Think your friends
in the Brotherhood

16:26.253 --> 16:27.754
can protect you
while you're in here?

16:27.787 --> 16:29.522
Anybody can get got.

16:29.556 --> 16:32.159
You want her so bad?

16:32.192 --> 16:35.428
You're a detective.
Go dig her up.

16:40.800 --> 16:42.535
(man)
Sorry, Fin.

16:42.569 --> 16:44.271
Last time I checked
this was Narcotics

16:44.304 --> 16:45.405
not Missing Persons.

16:45.438 --> 16:47.107
Tricia Knowles put Vance away.
We owe her.

16:47.140 --> 16:48.775
I wanna help,
but I don't have the resources

16:48.808 --> 16:50.510
to put a team
on a missing witness

16:50.543 --> 16:52.212
because her mother laid
a guilt trip on you.

16:52.245 --> 16:53.480
Look I know Vance.

16:53.513 --> 16:55.248
He didn't have to come
right out and say it.

16:55.282 --> 16:56.549
I got the message.
He killed Tricia.

16:56.583 --> 16:58.785
Bring me proof.
I can make something happen.

16:58.818 --> 17:01.121
How many cases
did I bring in for you?

17:01.154 --> 17:03.690
The Maldonado posse,
Pitkin Avenue Boys.

17:03.723 --> 17:05.658
You looked really good
taking all the credit

17:05.692 --> 17:07.527
at those press conferences.

17:07.560 --> 17:08.828
What do you want?

17:08.861 --> 17:10.697
Just one body
for a couple of days.

17:10.730 --> 17:13.633
Check out Vance's old crew,
see what I can find out.

17:13.666 --> 17:15.268
Sandoval.

17:15.302 --> 17:16.469
Who's that?

17:16.503 --> 17:17.537
New kid, white shield.

17:17.570 --> 17:18.405
No rookie.
How 'bout Melendez?

17:18.438 --> 17:19.606
Retired.
Jamal.

17:19.639 --> 17:21.174
Transferred.
You want a body?

17:21.208 --> 17:22.275
I'm giving you Sandoval.

17:22.309 --> 17:23.276
L.T.

17:23.310 --> 17:25.212
Fin Tutuola,
Miguel Sandoval.

17:25.245 --> 17:26.679
Mike.
It's a pleasure.

17:26.713 --> 17:30.283
(Pizzelli)
You guys get to know
each other.

17:30.317 --> 17:33.286
What happened to Vance's crew
after he got locked up?

17:33.320 --> 17:36.289
The Murphy twins are peddling
X to the club kids downtown.

17:36.323 --> 17:38.425
Fat Tony's selling a little
H for the Moro Brothers.

17:38.458 --> 17:41.261
If Vance reached out to anyone
to put that hit on Tricia,

17:41.294 --> 17:42.862
it'd be those psycho
Murphy boys.

17:42.895 --> 17:44.731
I know where they hang.
Let's pick 'em up.

17:44.764 --> 17:46.166
Nah, nah, nah.
They're too loyal.

17:46.199 --> 17:47.334
They'll never talk.

17:47.367 --> 17:49.269
Now Fat Tony,
he can't stop talking.

17:49.302 --> 17:50.770
We can wire up his place.

17:50.803 --> 17:53.273
I got this brand-new transmitter
I've been wanting to test out.

17:53.306 --> 17:55.142
Listen Gadget Boy,
I don't have time

17:55.175 --> 17:57.244
to spend a whole month
listening to Fat Tony bitch

17:57.277 --> 18:00.247
about his life, hoping he says
something about Tricia.

18:00.280 --> 18:01.481
How do you wanna do this?

18:01.514 --> 18:03.416
Old school,
get him on a buy and bust,

18:03.450 --> 18:05.418
drag his ass in
and sweat him.

18:05.452 --> 18:07.220
Let's go.
Hold up.

18:07.254 --> 18:10.823
They know my face.
We gotta send somebody else in.

18:10.857 --> 18:13.326
Who's the best undercover
in your squad?

18:13.360 --> 18:15.162
I'm your guy.

18:15.195 --> 18:16.896
No offense.

18:16.929 --> 18:20.200
But my grandmother wouldn't sell
an aspirin to you.

18:24.604 --> 18:26.173
Hey, man,
get off the court, man.

18:29.576 --> 18:31.744
Hey, yo, Tony.

18:31.778 --> 18:33.713
I know you?

18:33.746 --> 18:35.748
Ah, man, why you gotta
play me like that?

18:35.782 --> 18:37.750
Of course, you know me.
I'm Jose's cousin.

18:37.784 --> 18:40.420
You know, Jose, the guy
with the funny hat.

18:40.453 --> 18:41.454
[chuckling]

18:41.488 --> 18:43.590
Yeah, that's one ugly ass hat.

18:43.623 --> 18:44.691
[chuckling]
Yeah, yeah.

18:44.724 --> 18:46.393
But I still don't know you.

18:46.426 --> 18:49.296
Come on, man.

18:49.329 --> 18:51.298
You can see
I'm hurting, man.

18:51.331 --> 18:52.565
I need to get straight.

18:52.599 --> 18:54.601
Come on, help me out, man.

18:54.634 --> 18:55.435
How much you want?

18:55.468 --> 18:57.570
Give me three.

19:02.909 --> 19:04.244
That's 30.

19:04.277 --> 19:06.546
It's all there.
Trust me.

19:06.579 --> 19:08.715
Yeah. Right.

19:08.748 --> 19:10.217
Oh, yeah.

19:10.250 --> 19:11.651
All right, all right,
all right.

19:11.684 --> 19:13.220
Good look now.

19:17.890 --> 19:20.227
What's up, Tony?

19:20.260 --> 19:21.794
Long time no see.

19:21.828 --> 19:23.763
Go on, finish your hot dog.

19:31.338 --> 19:32.605
Whoa, whoa, where you think
you're going?

19:32.639 --> 19:33.873
In there to sweat him.

19:33.906 --> 19:35.742
No, you're not.
I'm doing this solo.

19:35.775 --> 19:36.876
I proved myself on the street.

19:36.909 --> 19:38.311
Now you're shutting me out.

19:38.345 --> 19:40.513
Fat Tony and I have history.
I need information.

19:40.547 --> 19:41.914
I don't have time
to school you.

19:44.451 --> 19:46.819
Fat Tony.

19:46.853 --> 19:49.856
Man, you have definitely
come down in the world.

19:49.889 --> 19:51.891
You used to have kids
out there slinging for you.

19:51.924 --> 19:53.826
Now you gotta do
your own dirty work.

19:53.860 --> 19:55.495
We got you cold, man.

19:55.528 --> 19:58.365
Dope, marked buy money--

19:58.398 --> 19:59.432
You got nothing

19:59.466 --> 20:01.000
but a cop with a grudge,

20:01.033 --> 20:02.569
planting drugs on
a solid citizen

20:02.602 --> 20:04.304
enjoying a sunny day
at the park.

20:04.337 --> 20:05.572
I won't do more

20:05.605 --> 20:06.873
than this one night in jail.

20:06.906 --> 20:08.408
May not even have to do that.

20:08.441 --> 20:10.543
How?

20:10.577 --> 20:12.779
Talk.

20:12.812 --> 20:13.946
About what?

20:13.980 --> 20:16.316
Tricia Knowles.

20:16.349 --> 20:19.586
Vance Dennis' little slut?

20:19.619 --> 20:20.953
Oh, you like 'em

20:20.987 --> 20:22.755
young and strung-out.

20:22.789 --> 20:24.491
You think I'm playing?

20:24.524 --> 20:28.795
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.

20:28.828 --> 20:30.297
Police brutality.

20:30.330 --> 20:31.298
Oh, my lawyer,

20:31.331 --> 20:33.300
she's gonna love this.

20:33.333 --> 20:34.867
I smell a million dollar
lawsuit.

20:34.901 --> 20:36.969
[door opens]

20:37.003 --> 20:38.438
Before you start
spending your money,

20:38.471 --> 20:40.873
you might wanna
take a look at this.

20:40.907 --> 20:41.874
Fiberoptics.

20:41.908 --> 20:43.510
See the camera's so small

20:43.543 --> 20:44.944
you never notice 'em.

20:44.977 --> 20:47.580
Sound qualities so clear,
you can hear a cockroach piss.

20:47.614 --> 20:48.615
Juries love 'em.

20:48.648 --> 20:52.385
What's this got to do with me?

20:52.419 --> 20:53.720
We got you wired.

20:53.753 --> 20:56.289
Your crib, your ride,
last three weeks, 24/7.

20:56.323 --> 20:57.724
See all those dime bags
add up.

20:57.757 --> 21:00.460
Talking major time.

21:00.493 --> 21:02.495
Could be 10,
maybe 15 years.

21:02.529 --> 21:06.866
Like my friend says,
we got you dead and stinkin'.

21:06.899 --> 21:10.803
That deal still on the table?

21:10.837 --> 21:12.505
For the next ten seconds.
Start talking.

21:25.685 --> 21:28.655
Vance knew Tricia
gave him up to you guys.

21:28.688 --> 21:31.658
So he sent the Murphy twins
to pay her a little visit.

21:31.691 --> 21:32.692
They kill her?

21:32.725 --> 21:33.860
The way I hear,

21:33.893 --> 21:36.396
they took her into
that abandoned building

21:36.429 --> 21:38.665
on St. Nick's Terrace
and gave her a hot shot.

21:41.868 --> 21:43.803
Some crackhead found the body.

21:43.836 --> 21:46.639
And you all thought
it was just another junkie O.D.

21:52.712 --> 21:54.414
Why didn't anyone tell me?

21:54.447 --> 21:56.983
There was no way to identify
your daughter's body.

21:57.016 --> 21:58.751
We didn't know
it was Tricia till today.

21:58.785 --> 22:00.420
Well, then,
how can you be sure?

22:00.453 --> 22:02.755
Maybe this informant
lied to you.

22:02.789 --> 22:04.824
(Warner)
We retained the personal
effects found with the body.

22:04.857 --> 22:07.727
Do you recognize this?

22:12.465 --> 22:14.133
It's Tricia's.

22:14.166 --> 22:16.769
I gave it to her when she made
her first Holy Communion.

22:16.803 --> 22:18.037
She never took it off.

22:23.643 --> 22:26.145
When can I bury my daughter?

22:26.178 --> 22:27.980
She's in a city grave
on Hart's Island.

22:28.014 --> 22:29.782
We'll exhume the body
right away.

22:29.816 --> 22:31.718
Just have the funeral home
contact me.

22:31.751 --> 22:32.952
I'm very sorry, Mrs.--

22:32.985 --> 22:35.354
It's too late.

22:39.992 --> 22:42.495
Doc, is there any way
to prove

22:42.529 --> 22:45.097
that Tricia didn't inject
the drugs herself?

22:45.131 --> 22:46.399
I read the autopsy report.

22:46.433 --> 22:48.501
No bruises,
no evidence of force.

22:48.535 --> 22:50.537
But I'll check
when the body comes in.

22:50.570 --> 22:52.672
There's no way the D.A.'s
gonna charge the murder

22:52.705 --> 22:54.173
with Fat Tony
as our only witness.

22:54.206 --> 22:55.975
Come on, man.
I'll take you back to the squad.

22:56.008 --> 22:57.510
Fin, there's something else.

22:57.544 --> 23:00.413
Tricia's autopsy report
noted a recent scar,

23:00.447 --> 23:03.149
partially healed...
from a C-section.

23:05.552 --> 23:06.653
She had a baby.

23:17.464 --> 23:18.798
(Fin)
"And they bought
the potter's field

23:18.831 --> 23:21.701
to bury strangers in."

23:21.734 --> 23:25.004
Matthew 27, verse seven.

23:25.037 --> 23:27.540
You didn't have to come out.

23:27.574 --> 23:30.477
Yes, I did.

23:30.510 --> 23:32.579
It's peaceful here.

23:32.612 --> 23:34.614
Nothing but graves.

23:34.647 --> 23:36.148
Hart Island
once had a plague house

23:36.182 --> 23:37.984
during the yellow fever.

23:38.017 --> 23:39.986
Then became
a boy's reformatory.

23:40.019 --> 23:42.922
Then a jail for
Confederate soldiers.

23:42.955 --> 23:45.191
The city even used it
during World War II

23:45.224 --> 23:47.960
to hold the crew
of a captured German U-boat.

23:47.994 --> 23:50.863
There's still a whole bunch
of Nike missile silos out here.

23:50.897 --> 23:53.165
Even the old bleachers
from Ebbetts Field.

23:53.199 --> 23:55.668
Mostly dead people
nobody remembers.

23:55.702 --> 23:56.969
Close to a million.

24:01.107 --> 24:02.575
(man)
Set it down easy.

24:07.113 --> 24:08.815
All right, guys.

24:08.848 --> 24:13.052
We got 6-9-1-9-1-3-2.

24:13.085 --> 24:14.186
Here's your body.

24:14.220 --> 24:15.588
Thanks.

24:33.540 --> 24:34.774
What's going on?

24:34.807 --> 24:36.275
What's up, Captain?

24:36.308 --> 24:38.778
Just checking out something
on the computer.

24:38.811 --> 24:40.012
Looking for Tricia's baby?

24:40.046 --> 24:41.080
How'd you know?

24:41.113 --> 24:42.815
Warner called.

24:42.849 --> 24:45.284
There's nothing I can do
to fix what happened to Tricia.

24:45.317 --> 24:47.053
But if I can find
her little boy...

24:47.086 --> 24:48.688
Turn it over
to Missing Persons.

24:48.721 --> 24:49.956
I can't do that, Captain.

24:49.989 --> 24:51.958
And I can't have you
out there cowboying it up.

24:51.991 --> 24:53.760
What am I supposed to tell
Tricia's mom?

24:53.793 --> 24:55.127
I'm sorry I got
your daughter killed?

24:55.161 --> 24:56.696
By the way, you have a grandson,

24:56.729 --> 24:57.997
but I don't know
where he is.

24:58.030 --> 24:59.766
You're too close to this.

24:59.799 --> 25:03.603
I turned my back on Tricia once.
I'm not gonna do it again.

25:07.874 --> 25:09.008
If you need help, you call.

25:19.686 --> 25:20.887
Casey.

25:20.920 --> 25:22.054
Hey, I didn't know
you're back.

25:22.088 --> 25:23.122
How you feeling?

25:23.155 --> 25:24.957
I'm getting there.
I need a favor.

25:24.991 --> 25:26.726
You name it.
I'm looking for a baby.

25:26.759 --> 25:30.563
Birth certificate says
he was born at Mercy Hospital.

25:30.597 --> 25:32.164
Mother's name is Tricia Knowles.

25:32.198 --> 25:34.133
Might be a lead in the charts.

25:34.166 --> 25:36.035
Missing child?
I just talked to Captain Cragen.

25:36.068 --> 25:37.670
He didn't mention it.

25:37.704 --> 25:40.139
It's not an SVU case.
I'm helping out Narcotics.

25:40.172 --> 25:42.341
Mike Sandoval,
ADA Casey Novak.

25:42.374 --> 25:44.143
Nice to meet you.

25:44.176 --> 25:45.812
Same here.

25:45.845 --> 25:47.079
I gotta arraign this case.

25:47.113 --> 25:49.081
But then, I'll fax a subpoena
over to the hospital

25:49.115 --> 25:49.982
for the medical records.

25:50.016 --> 25:52.619
Turns into something,
you'll let me know?

25:52.652 --> 25:53.285
(Fin)
You got it.

25:57.089 --> 25:58.791
You're helping me?

25:58.825 --> 26:00.259
Why didn't you tell her
the truth?

26:00.292 --> 26:01.327
I'm working off the books.

26:01.360 --> 26:03.095
She'd ask too many questions.

26:03.129 --> 26:04.363
You're playing fast and loose

26:04.396 --> 26:05.698
because you got
a guilty conscience.

26:05.732 --> 26:07.700
So what's that supposed
to mean?

26:07.734 --> 26:10.870
Tricia Knowles died
because you screwed up.

26:10.903 --> 26:12.338
Look, Rookie,

26:12.371 --> 26:14.073
you don't often get a chance
to make things right.

26:14.106 --> 26:16.175
And when you do,
you gotta grab it.

26:16.208 --> 26:18.010
Now you give me the word,
and I'll call your C.O.

26:18.044 --> 26:19.245
and tell him I don't need you.

26:22.882 --> 26:25.217
Come on.
Let's take a ride to Mercy.

26:30.923 --> 26:32.191
(woman)
When Tricia came in

26:32.224 --> 26:34.393
for her first prenatal exam,
she was a mess.

26:34.426 --> 26:36.663
High as a kite and already
in her second trimester.

26:36.696 --> 26:37.797
Let me guess.

26:37.830 --> 26:39.265
Baby was born
with positive tox screen.

26:39.298 --> 26:40.967
Got sent to foster care.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.035
No, I read her the riot act.

26:43.069 --> 26:46.138
Tricia got clean.
Baby was born perfectly healthy.

26:46.172 --> 26:48.274
See.
That's Tricia and Austin.

26:48.307 --> 26:49.909
When was the last time
you saw her?

26:49.942 --> 26:52.011
About six months ago.

26:52.044 --> 26:53.780
Appointment cards came back.

26:53.813 --> 26:54.947
"Moved,"
no forwarding address.

26:54.981 --> 26:56.949
And I'd hope
she'd gone home.

26:56.983 --> 26:58.050
To her mother?

26:58.084 --> 26:59.719
I kept telling Tricia to,

26:59.752 --> 27:01.688
but she was so sure
she could make it on her own.

27:01.721 --> 27:02.655
Did she have a job?

27:02.689 --> 27:03.856
Waitress.

27:03.890 --> 27:06.225
In a diner down in Chelsea.

27:06.258 --> 27:07.293
(man)
I can't believe

27:07.326 --> 27:09.161
she's dead,
such a good girl.

27:09.195 --> 27:11.330
When did she quit?
She didn't.

27:11.363 --> 27:14.300
She left early one day
last spring and never came back.

27:14.333 --> 27:16.202
She sent her roommate
to pick up the baby.

27:16.235 --> 27:18.771
Austin was here?

27:18.805 --> 27:20.439
Every day.
My mother watched the kid.

27:20.472 --> 27:22.241
She lives upstairs.
Fell in love with that boy.

27:22.274 --> 27:24.977
Tricia's roommate,
did she say anything

27:25.011 --> 27:26.345
when she picked up the kid?

27:26.378 --> 27:28.180
Yeah, that Tricia had
a family emergency

27:28.214 --> 27:29.749
and she asked her
to bring the baby

27:29.782 --> 27:31.083
up to her mother's.

27:31.117 --> 27:33.019
This roommate.
She have a name?

27:33.052 --> 27:35.688
Yeah, uh...Lizzie Jones.

27:35.722 --> 27:37.890
Tricia asked me to hire her,
but it didn't work out.

27:37.924 --> 27:39.291
Why not?

27:39.325 --> 27:41.861
She was nasty
to the customers.

27:41.894 --> 27:43.062
Shorted the busboys on tips.

27:43.095 --> 27:44.931
I think maybe she was high.

27:44.964 --> 27:46.465
You let an addict
take the baby?

27:46.498 --> 27:48.701
She was Tricia's best friend.

27:48.735 --> 27:50.469
Why, did something happen
to little Austin?

27:50.502 --> 27:52.171
That's what we're trying
to find out, sir.

27:52.204 --> 27:53.906
You know where
we can find Lizzie Jones?

27:53.940 --> 27:56.275
I don't know.
Up in Yonkers maybe.

27:56.308 --> 27:58.911
Well, she grew up there
with Tricia.

28:02.381 --> 28:03.916
(Sandra)
Of course I know her.

28:03.950 --> 28:05.718
Lizzie used to live
across the street.

28:05.752 --> 28:10.422
She and Tricia both went
to Cardinal Newman.

28:10.456 --> 28:11.891
They look pretty close.

28:11.924 --> 28:13.425
I tried to separate them.

28:13.459 --> 28:16.028
But Tricia thought
Lizzie was cool.

28:16.062 --> 28:17.964
When Lizzie started smoking,
so did Trish.

28:17.997 --> 28:21.233
Then it was cutting school,
getting tattoos.

28:21.267 --> 28:24.403
When Lizzie started doing drugs,
I put my foot down.

28:24.436 --> 28:26.305
I told Tricia she couldn't
see Lizzie anymore.

28:26.338 --> 28:28.107
And they ran away.

28:28.140 --> 28:29.375
Do you have any idea

28:29.408 --> 28:31.243
where Lizzie might be?

28:31.277 --> 28:33.212
I ran into her mother
at the supermarket last month.

28:33.245 --> 28:35.214
She said Lizzie was in rehab.

28:35.247 --> 28:36.348
New dawn, new day,

28:36.382 --> 28:37.449
something like that.

28:42.421 --> 28:44.423
Lizzie's involved in
my daughter's murder, isn't she?

28:46.893 --> 28:48.260
We don't know.

28:48.294 --> 28:51.097
Then why are you
looking for her?

28:51.130 --> 28:53.299
Uh, Mrs. Knowles,

28:53.332 --> 28:55.034
before Tricia died
she had a baby.

28:55.067 --> 28:56.502
A child?

28:59.338 --> 29:01.207
Yeah, he'd be about
one years old right now.

29:01.240 --> 29:02.274
His name is Austin.

29:02.308 --> 29:04.176
Where is he?

29:04.210 --> 29:06.478
We think Lizzie may have him.

29:06.512 --> 29:09.916
Please.

29:09.949 --> 29:11.483
Please you've got
to find him.

29:11.517 --> 29:14.420
I will.

29:14.453 --> 29:16.022
I promise.

29:20.827 --> 29:23.830
Why the hell did you tell that
woman you'd find her grandchild?

29:23.863 --> 29:25.798
I got a good feeling about this.

29:25.832 --> 29:27.566
No, what you've got
is post-shooting trauma.

29:27.599 --> 29:30.269
We studied it in my police
psych course at John J.

29:30.302 --> 29:32.171
After a fatal,
guys sometimes feel guilty--

29:32.204 --> 29:33.840
You ever kill somebody?

29:33.873 --> 29:35.341
No.

29:35.374 --> 29:38.310
When you do, I'll let you
tell me how I feel.

29:38.344 --> 29:40.346
Let's go find this rehab spot.

29:42.348 --> 29:44.050
It's in the 5-0,
up in the Bronx.

29:44.083 --> 29:45.818
But you know
the folks who run it

29:45.852 --> 29:47.153
will just cite confidentiality.

29:47.186 --> 29:48.454
They're not gonna tell us
jack about Lizzie.

29:48.487 --> 29:50.156
You got a better idea?

29:50.189 --> 29:52.358
Ask someone without scruples.

29:52.391 --> 29:54.326
One of my informants
is in that program.

29:54.360 --> 29:56.428
Couple of bucks, he'll give us
Lizzie's life story.

29:56.462 --> 29:58.898
She hangs in a park
across from the clinic.

29:58.931 --> 30:01.000
Sure, I know Lizzie.
She used to work the program.

30:01.033 --> 30:03.069
But she backslid.

30:03.102 --> 30:04.336
Still came here to cop.

30:04.370 --> 30:05.304
From who?

30:09.208 --> 30:10.442
Crazy Jim.

30:10.476 --> 30:11.978
Nut job with the guitar.

30:12.011 --> 30:14.280
Thinks he's the white
Jimi Hendrix.

30:14.313 --> 30:15.982
Lizzie come here
to score lately?

30:16.015 --> 30:17.917
No, she don't need me
no more.

30:17.950 --> 30:20.920
Got herself this new boyfriend.
Dealer by the name of T.D.

30:20.953 --> 30:23.422
He said he's gonna be around
here next couple of days.

30:23.455 --> 30:25.391
Got some good new product
coming in.

30:25.424 --> 30:27.493
Lizzie usually come here
with him?
No.

30:27.526 --> 30:29.495
But she'll stop by
when she's working.

30:29.528 --> 30:30.629
Working?

30:30.662 --> 30:31.964
(man)
The girl's a booster.

30:31.998 --> 30:33.132
That Lizzie could steal anything

30:33.165 --> 30:35.267
as long as it ain't nailed down.

30:35.301 --> 30:36.936
You see these sneakers?

30:36.969 --> 30:39.305
200 retail.
I give her my size.

30:39.338 --> 30:41.607
The next day they're
on my feet for 35 bucks.

30:41.640 --> 30:43.509
(Sandoval)
You ever see her with a baby?

30:43.542 --> 30:44.944
Never seen her without.

30:44.977 --> 30:46.578
You know, it's sorta
like a gimmick.

30:46.612 --> 30:47.980
She uses that stroller

30:48.014 --> 30:49.481
like it's her own private
shopping cart.

30:49.515 --> 30:51.050
(Fin)
So where she living at?

30:51.083 --> 30:53.285
With T.D.

30:53.319 --> 30:55.454
I went over there to pick up
a new TV

30:55.487 --> 30:57.523
she got me
for my mom's birthday.

30:57.556 --> 30:59.291
(Sandoval)
Address?

30:59.325 --> 31:00.459
Money talks.

31:06.065 --> 31:07.866
Little house over
in Kingsbridge Terrace.

31:11.137 --> 31:12.504
T.D. Beeman.

31:12.538 --> 31:14.373
A couple of possession collars,
one for sale.

31:14.406 --> 31:15.407
Did a nickel upstate.

31:15.441 --> 31:17.443
How do you wanna do this?

31:17.476 --> 31:19.045
Well, no violence
on the priors,

31:19.078 --> 31:20.612
I say we just do it
straight up.

31:20.646 --> 31:22.114
Knock on the door,
ask for Lizzie.

31:22.148 --> 31:23.449
You got it.

31:36.228 --> 31:37.629
No movement inside.

31:37.663 --> 31:39.631
So what? We're just gonna
sit on the house

31:39.665 --> 31:41.400
and wait for someone
to come home?

31:43.502 --> 31:45.571
Let's take a look in back,
might find something,

31:45.604 --> 31:48.040
give us probable cause
for a warrant.

31:55.014 --> 31:56.082
This place is a dump.

31:56.115 --> 31:58.350
You surprised?

31:58.384 --> 32:01.053
I'm surprised he's got
a pole cam.

32:05.491 --> 32:07.159
Back door doesn't look locked.

32:07.193 --> 32:09.095
I'm gonna take a quick peek.
See if we see anything inside.

32:09.128 --> 32:10.129
Trip wire!

32:29.348 --> 32:31.117
You should have EMS
check out your shoulder.

32:31.150 --> 32:32.384
Make sure you didn't
bust your stitches open.

32:32.418 --> 32:34.186
They'll just try
to send me home.

32:34.220 --> 32:35.521
The Fire Department's
taking awhile.

32:35.554 --> 32:37.256
If Lizzie and the baby
were inside...

32:37.289 --> 32:39.125
Don't even go there.
I tripped the wire.

32:39.158 --> 32:40.626
You didn't rig the house
to blow.

32:40.659 --> 32:42.261
I just wanna know why
some low-level drug dealer's

32:42.294 --> 32:44.596
got his house booby-trapped.

32:44.630 --> 32:47.133
With Claymore
anti-personnel mines.

32:47.166 --> 32:48.600
A serious military ordinance.

32:48.634 --> 32:49.635
Bomb squad says

32:49.668 --> 32:51.137
other entry points
were also wired.

32:51.170 --> 32:52.404
You're lucky you spotted it.

32:52.438 --> 32:54.406
A few feet closer,
the shrapnel would've got you.

32:54.440 --> 32:55.674
I didn't see any shrap--

32:55.707 --> 32:57.376
Embedded in the wood.

32:57.409 --> 32:59.311
Guy's willing to blow up
his own house.

32:59.345 --> 33:01.080
He's got something
serious to hide.

33:01.113 --> 33:02.148
Hey, guys, we're secure now.

33:02.181 --> 33:03.149
Come on in.

33:03.182 --> 33:04.150
Did you find anyone?

33:04.183 --> 33:06.752
No bodies.

33:06.785 --> 33:10.056
Claymores were set on top
of these gas cans.

33:10.089 --> 33:11.457
Made sure the place
would burn.

33:11.490 --> 33:13.325
I know why.
Check this out.

33:13.359 --> 33:15.127
Cold pills.

33:15.161 --> 33:16.528
Yup.
And matchbooks.

33:16.562 --> 33:18.564
Thousands of 'em.

33:18.597 --> 33:20.532
You need both to cook
crystal meth.

33:20.566 --> 33:22.634
Well, that explains the pole
cams and the booby traps.

33:22.668 --> 33:24.770
Meth makes you paranoid.
Beyond paranoid.

33:24.803 --> 33:26.805
I once collared a heavy tweaker
who shot his dog

33:26.838 --> 33:29.075
because he was afraid he's gonna
rat him out to the cops.

33:29.108 --> 33:30.409
So this is a meth lab?

33:30.442 --> 33:31.677
I doubt it.

33:31.710 --> 33:33.712
Chemicals you need
to make meth were stored here,

33:33.745 --> 33:35.714
explosion would have
taken out half a block.

33:35.747 --> 33:37.583
In a clandestine lab, you don't
even turn on the light.

33:37.616 --> 33:39.451
One spark--[snapping]--
the whole place blows.

33:39.485 --> 33:40.719
(man)
That's why the house
didn't go up.

33:40.752 --> 33:41.787
They're storing
the supplies here,

33:41.820 --> 33:43.255
and the lab is someplace else.

33:43.289 --> 33:45.091
T.D.'s a chemist?

33:45.124 --> 33:46.558
Could be, download a recipe
off the Internet.

33:46.592 --> 33:49.428
It's as easy as making pancakes.

33:49.461 --> 33:51.163
Junkies used to use meth
when I was working Narcotics,

33:51.197 --> 33:53.232
but they didn't cook it.

33:55.601 --> 33:57.769
T.D.'s using
the red phosphorous method.

33:57.803 --> 33:59.471
The striker plates off
the matchbook covers

33:59.505 --> 34:00.572
start the process.

34:00.606 --> 34:02.341
Cold pills contain
pseudoephedrine.

34:02.374 --> 34:04.376
That's the main ingredient
in meth.

34:04.410 --> 34:07.613
Plus starter fluid,
antifreeze, drain cleaner.

34:07.646 --> 34:09.315
Extract the chemicals
they contain.

34:09.348 --> 34:11.617
Purify it, boil it, strain it
through a coffee filter,

34:11.650 --> 34:12.618
you got crystal meth.

34:12.651 --> 34:14.320
And this stuff's all easy
to get.

34:14.353 --> 34:16.088
You don't need a fancy
setup to make it.

34:16.122 --> 34:17.389
This is a replica
of a portable lab

34:17.423 --> 34:19.158
we found in the trunk
of a Buick.

34:19.191 --> 34:21.760
So if T.D.'s cooking on wheels,
how we gonna find him?

34:21.793 --> 34:25.131
Geographical profiling.
I studied it at John J.

34:25.164 --> 34:27.133
The FDA limits the sale
of pseudoephedrine

34:27.166 --> 34:28.767
to one box per customer.

34:28.800 --> 34:31.170
So meth cooks have to shoplift
from lots of stores.

34:31.203 --> 34:33.605
So that's why he needed a
girlfriend who's a booster.

34:33.639 --> 34:35.874
Now we search the 61s
for stolen cold pills,

34:35.907 --> 34:38.544
crunch the data, we got
a target area for the lab.

34:38.577 --> 34:40.546
You think they'll hit
the same place again?

34:40.579 --> 34:42.381
Perps tend to steal
in their comfort zone.

34:42.414 --> 34:43.482
Lizzie needs pseudoephedrine.

34:43.515 --> 34:45.517
She's gonna go
where she can get it.

34:50.856 --> 34:54.393
I heard about the explosion.
What the hell is going on?

34:54.426 --> 34:56.828
A rookie got ahead of himself.

34:56.862 --> 34:59.365
Listen, the other night,
what you said about helping out.

34:59.398 --> 35:00.432
What do you need?

35:00.466 --> 35:01.800
The girl who took
Tricia's baby

35:01.833 --> 35:04.203
is stealing supplies
for a meth lab.

35:04.236 --> 35:05.504
They were getting ready to cook.

35:05.537 --> 35:06.638
The explosion wiped out

35:06.672 --> 35:08.407
their stash of ingredients.

35:08.440 --> 35:09.675
And you figure
she's stocking up.

35:09.708 --> 35:12.244
This is a list
of larcenies reported by

35:12.278 --> 35:14.813
mini-marts and drug stores
all over the Bronx.

35:14.846 --> 35:17.483
The problem is, the list
doesn't show what got stolen.

35:17.516 --> 35:18.917
What are we looking for?

35:18.950 --> 35:20.852
Over-the-counter cold pills.

35:20.886 --> 35:24.756
We'll man the phones.
Call the results into you.

35:24.790 --> 35:26.792
No, we haven't made an arrest
for your stolen condoms.

35:26.825 --> 35:28.294
We're a little busy.

35:28.327 --> 35:29.661
But we'll get right on it.

35:29.695 --> 35:31.863
And the only thing missing
was the cold pills?

35:31.897 --> 35:34.766
Right, 26 boxes.
Thank you so much.

35:34.800 --> 35:36.468
Got two more.

35:36.502 --> 35:38.670
Both stores ripped off
by a female booster

35:38.704 --> 35:39.938
with a baby carriage.

35:39.971 --> 35:43.509
One at Corlear.
The other at 238.

35:43.542 --> 35:45.944
And Olivia found a store
at Broadway and 234.

35:45.977 --> 35:48.314
That makes 13 hits
in Kingsbridge.

35:48.347 --> 35:49.615
Lizzie's gotta be working
this neighborhood.

35:49.648 --> 35:51.783
Last time I talked to Fin
they were close by.

35:53.985 --> 35:56.288
Yeah, Fin,
we found two more stores,

35:56.322 --> 35:58.424
but you're definitely
closing in.

36:01.760 --> 36:03.329
(Fin)
You recognize this girl?

36:03.362 --> 36:05.497
You know how many people
come in here, man?

36:05.531 --> 36:07.733
Come here.

36:07.766 --> 36:10.202
I know you got Slurpees to sell,
but I got a missing boy.

36:10.236 --> 36:11.770
You need to look again.

36:11.803 --> 36:14.606
All right, there was a chick
in here a little while ago.

36:14.640 --> 36:16.875
Could be her, but she don't
look like that now.

36:16.908 --> 36:17.876
She's a total crack 'ho.

36:17.909 --> 36:19.411
Fin, shelf's bare.

36:19.445 --> 36:21.447
Fifth store so far without
a box of cold pills left.

36:21.480 --> 36:22.814
What?
My boss is gonna kill me.

36:22.848 --> 36:24.583
She have her baby with her?

36:24.616 --> 36:26.918
I don't remember.
Think!

36:26.952 --> 36:30.222
She asked if there were any
auto supply stores around here.

36:30.256 --> 36:31.490
Shopping for starter fluid.

36:31.523 --> 36:33.259
They need the ether in it
for the cook.

36:33.292 --> 36:34.460
You tell her where to go?

36:34.493 --> 36:35.727
Yeah, all the way
down to Putnam Avenue.

36:35.761 --> 36:37.496
She was bitching
about the long walk.

36:39.631 --> 36:41.533
There's the auto supply
up ahead.

36:43.935 --> 36:45.671
There's Lizzie.

36:49.341 --> 36:50.342
Lizzie.

36:50.376 --> 36:51.610
Who the hell are you?

36:51.643 --> 36:53.011
Where's the baby?
What baby?

36:53.044 --> 36:54.846
Austin Knowles.
Tricia's baby.

36:54.880 --> 36:56.448
I don't know.
Ask Tricia.

36:56.482 --> 36:57.383
She's dead.
You sold her out to Vance.

36:57.416 --> 36:59.385
What'd he give you?
A couple grams of crack

36:59.418 --> 37:00.819
for your best friend's life?
I didn't do it.

37:00.852 --> 37:02.454
You set her up
and you stole the kid.

37:02.488 --> 37:05.691
Leave me alone.
Get off me!

37:05.724 --> 37:07.993
You reek, I can smell
the stink of death all over you.

37:08.026 --> 37:10.296
You wanna kill yourself?
You go right ahead.

37:10.329 --> 37:12.764
But you are not gonna take
that little boy down with you.

37:12.798 --> 37:14.400
Now tell me where he is.

37:14.433 --> 37:17.035
With T.D.

37:17.068 --> 37:18.470
Where?

37:18.504 --> 37:20.539
His sister Paula's place.

37:20.572 --> 37:23.875
He uses her kitchen
for the cook.

37:23.909 --> 37:27.546
Lizzie Jones, you're under
arrest for petty larceny.

37:27.579 --> 37:29.415
You have the right
to remain silent.

37:29.448 --> 37:30.849
Anything you...

37:30.882 --> 37:33.552
ESU and HazMat are on their way.
ETA 15 minutes.

37:33.585 --> 37:34.853
"Miss Paula's Day Care."

37:34.886 --> 37:36.455
(Fin)
There's gotta be kids in there.

37:36.488 --> 37:38.324
Better get 'em out
before T.D. starts cooking.

37:38.357 --> 37:39.691
Could be cooking already, man.
Let's go.

37:39.725 --> 37:41.593
Whoa, we can't.
We need Tyvek suits, air packs,

37:41.627 --> 37:42.728
full level B protection.

37:42.761 --> 37:45.764
Cook produces phosphine gas.
We breathe it, we could die.

37:45.797 --> 37:47.366
Those kids could be
breathing that right now.

37:47.399 --> 37:48.534
Someone's coming out.

37:50.068 --> 37:52.371
[coughing]

37:52.404 --> 37:54.706
Come on, let's go.
Come on.
(child)
I wanna go home.

37:57.443 --> 37:58.777
You smell that?
T.D.'s cooking.

37:58.810 --> 38:00.712
(Sandoval)
No telling how long the kids

38:00.746 --> 38:02.314
have been exposed
to those chemicals.

38:02.348 --> 38:03.682
They're gonna need
medical treatment.

38:03.715 --> 38:05.617
Those kids are all a lot
older than Austin.

38:05.651 --> 38:06.952
I bet you he's still inside.

38:06.985 --> 38:08.387
Let's go.
We can't.

38:08.420 --> 38:09.988
We have to wait
for HazMat to make it safe.

38:10.021 --> 38:11.390
Screw HazMat.

38:24.570 --> 38:27.706
Hey. Hey. Shh.
Don't make any noise.

38:27.739 --> 38:30.709
Okay? All right.
Everybody come with me.

38:37.749 --> 38:40.386
(man)
Let's see some bubbles.
Come on.

38:40.419 --> 38:44.656
I need that ether.
Where the hell is that bitch?

38:44.690 --> 38:46.425
Austin, I'm gonna kick
Lizzie's ass

38:46.458 --> 38:47.959
if she's not back here
in five minutes.

38:47.993 --> 38:49.561
Police, don't move!

38:49.595 --> 38:51.497
Put the pot down,
and step away from the stove.

38:51.530 --> 38:53.765
You ain't gonna shoot me.

38:53.799 --> 38:54.800
You wanna bet?

38:54.833 --> 38:56.034
If you do...

38:56.067 --> 38:59.405
this whole place
will go up like a roman candle.

38:59.438 --> 39:00.706
I don't care
about the drugs or you.

39:00.739 --> 39:02.741
I just want Austin.

39:02.774 --> 39:05.644
[crying loudly]

39:05.677 --> 39:07.479
What's the kid got
to do with you?

39:07.513 --> 39:08.480
I know his mother.
Tricia's dead.

39:08.514 --> 39:10.148
I know.

39:10.181 --> 39:12.083
Back off!

39:12.117 --> 39:13.619
This stuff will melt
your face off.

39:13.652 --> 39:15.587
Just give me the baby,
and I'll leave.

39:15.621 --> 39:16.622
No.

39:16.655 --> 39:18.023
That's not how it's gonna go.

39:18.056 --> 39:20.659
Me and this kid
we're walking outta here.

39:20.692 --> 39:21.793
I can't let that happen.

39:21.827 --> 39:23.829
Yeah, how you gonna
stop me, hmm?

39:23.862 --> 39:24.996
[baby crying]

39:28.133 --> 39:30.469
You stay there.

39:30.502 --> 39:31.603
What took you so long?

39:35.040 --> 39:36.508
(man)
Screw you! Screw all of you!

39:36.542 --> 39:39.511
You have no idea
who you're messing with!

39:39.545 --> 39:40.579
Let go of me!

39:47.519 --> 39:48.854
Doc said we're clear to go.

39:48.887 --> 39:52.057
You did good.

39:52.090 --> 39:54.993
Thanks.

39:55.026 --> 39:57.162
(woman)
Please, please.

39:57.195 --> 40:00.666
Please, my grandson's in there.
You have got to let me in.

40:00.699 --> 40:02.968
Captain!
Captain Cragen.

40:03.001 --> 40:04.570
Captain!
It's okay.
It's okay, I got this.

40:04.603 --> 40:05.837
Miss Knowles,
this area is off limits.

40:05.871 --> 40:07.773
You can't come in here.

40:07.806 --> 40:09.941
But Detective Tutuola called.
He found Austin.

40:09.975 --> 40:11.477
They're being
decontaminated right now.

40:11.510 --> 40:13.178
You cannot see them
till they're cleared.

40:13.211 --> 40:14.980
Please.

40:17.248 --> 40:18.550
Come on.
Come with me.

40:18.584 --> 40:19.685
Thank you.

40:21.820 --> 40:24.790
Fin!

40:24.823 --> 40:27.493
Look, there's Grandma.

40:27.526 --> 40:29.427
Look, look.

40:39.605 --> 40:41.473
Thank you.

41:19.778 --> 41:22.013
