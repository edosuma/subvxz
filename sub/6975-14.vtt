What who wants
to have happened?

16:52.625 --> 16:55.560
Well, I'm told this case
involves you.

16:58.064 --> 17:00.555
It may involve
someone close to me.

17:00.633 --> 17:02.498
Can we stick to
the facts, please?

17:02.568 --> 17:03.865
Well, it's pretty clear

17:03.936 --> 17:06.097
that the woman who was
found out here

17:06.305 --> 17:08.102
did not inflict
her own injuries.

17:08.307 --> 17:10.434
That she was dropped here
by someone

17:10.476 --> 17:13.934
and whoever it was cared about
her enough not to kill her.

17:13.979 --> 17:15.412
Did you happen to know

17:15.481 --> 17:17.608
the peculiar nature
of her injuries?

17:17.683 --> 17:20.550
Yes. They were peculiar,
but not altogether different

17:20.618 --> 17:22.814
from your typical cult
ritualistic abuse.

17:22.855 --> 17:24.378
Agent Reyes, we're dealing

17:24.457 --> 17:26.448
with abductions here...

17:26.525 --> 17:28.425
not by any cult.

17:28.493 --> 17:29.722
Okay. Good.

17:29.795 --> 17:31.729
I mean, if it's not.

17:31.797 --> 17:34.527
But you think that it is.

17:34.600 --> 17:37.763
Well, I go on what
I know, of course

17:37.837 --> 17:40.863
but I try to stay,
you know, open.

17:40.940 --> 17:43.067
So, what do you think happened?

17:43.142 --> 17:45.542
Well, I'm told
thatAgent Mulder

17:45.611 --> 17:47.875
and the other people who were
taken were true believers.

17:47.947 --> 17:50.711
People 100% convinced in
the abduction phenomenon.

17:50.750 --> 17:53.412
If this is about these people
staging their own abductions...

17:53.486 --> 17:55.886
No, it's about people
coming together.

17:55.955 --> 17:57.513
Like minds as a group.

17:57.590 --> 17:59.717
So you're basically saying that

17:59.792 --> 18:02.989
Agent Mulder has joined some
sort of UFO cult.

18:03.062 --> 18:05.963
Call it a group.

18:06.031 --> 18:07.055
For what?

18:07.099 --> 18:08.691
Well, we've all heard
the news stories

18:08.768 --> 18:10.599
about transport
to a mother ship

18:10.636 --> 18:12.501
the idea of a giant
mother wheel.

18:12.571 --> 18:15.438
The whole Heaven's Gate thing.

18:15.508 --> 18:17.499
I see.

18:17.576 --> 18:19.066
It'd make sense.

18:19.145 --> 18:20.942
The leader of
the cult leaves

18:21.013 --> 18:22.776
this woman out
here to die.

18:22.815 --> 18:24.146
Learning she's still alive

18:24.383 --> 18:26.374
he comes back to kidnap her again
for fear of exposure.

18:26.452 --> 18:28.613
It'd make sense, too

18:28.687 --> 18:31.588
that if we fiind this guy,
maybe we fiind Mulder.

18:31.657 --> 18:34.125
Are you asking me
to believe this?

18:34.193 --> 18:36.991
[ Reyes ]
No. That's not what I said.

18:37.062 --> 18:40.793
I don't think
he left her to die.

18:40.866 --> 18:41.958
I don't think she's dead.

18:42.034 --> 18:43.934
Based on what?

18:44.003 --> 18:47.996
Nothing, really.

18:48.073 --> 18:50.633
It's just a feeling.

18:59.452 --> 19:00.919
What are you
walking away for?

19:00.986 --> 19:02.510
It makes
some kind of sense.

19:02.555 --> 19:04.716
I'm glad you agree with her,
Agent Doggett

19:04.790 --> 19:07.554
because I'm not even sure
that she agrees with you.

19:07.593 --> 19:09.925
Nor has she made any sense
for me of how the doctor

19:09.995 --> 19:12.623
who removed Teresa Hoese
from the hospital last night

19:12.698 --> 19:15.496
seems, by all accounts
to have been in two places at once.

19:15.568 --> 19:18.867
I know where you're going
with this, Agent Scully

19:18.938 --> 19:21.566

to tell me this is

we part company.

19:51.604 --> 19:54.937
We were almost too late.

20:42.154 --> 20:43.678
Oh, hi.

20:46.625 --> 20:48.957

combing the hills

20:48.994 --> 20:50.052

20:50.129 --> 20:51.994
I'm on my way out to see him.

on this woman's injuries--

20:55.668 --> 20:56.600

21:02.741 --> 21:05.266
Is there something you're
looking for, Agent Reyes

21:05.344 --> 21:07.312
in particular?

21:07.546 --> 21:09.343
Implants,
or signs of them.

21:09.548 --> 21:12.711
Implants?

21:12.785 --> 21:13.809
I don't understand.

21:13.852 --> 21:16.650
Metallic implants
placed in the body

21:16.722 --> 21:18.952
oftentimes in
the nasal cavity.

21:19.024 --> 21:20.355
Sometimes made of bone
or cartilage

21:20.593 --> 21:22.220
making detection
a little more diffiicult.

21:22.294 --> 21:24.728
Yeah, I'm well aware
of how they work.

21:24.797 --> 21:27.698
You said you didn't
understand.

21:27.733 --> 21:29.257
I don't understand your interest

evidence of alien abduction

21:32.571 --> 21:34.198
as a disbeliever

Excuse me.

21:40.746 --> 21:42.008
I know what I heard

and I heard you say that
""What we're dealing with here is

21:45.284 --> 21:47.081
nothing more than a UFO cult.""

21:47.119 --> 21:48.609
There's the confusion.

21:48.687 --> 21:49.949
I still believe that

21:50.022 --> 21:53.287
but it doesn't mean I don't
believe in the phenomena.

I try to stay open.

you specialize in again?

22:12.378 --> 22:14.107
Ritualistic crime?

22:14.179 --> 22:15.908
Right. Satanic ritual abuse.

any hard evidence.

22:34.266 --> 22:38.032
I just have
certain spiritual notions.

22:38.103 --> 22:42.665
I believe there are energies
in the universe.

22:42.741 --> 22:44.436
It might sound
kind of cosmic

I'm sensitive to them.

to heal people.
