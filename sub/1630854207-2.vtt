10:08.976 --> 10:10.675
I quit!
- I quit, too.

10:11.912 --> 10:13.778
- Woo!
- (gasps)

10:13.780 --> 10:15.713
Rhian: Fine! Then you can both
vacate the company trailer

10:15.782 --> 10:17.448
By the end of the day.

10:17.517 --> 10:19.117
I know you can't afford
to live anywhere else.

10:19.186 --> 10:21.218
- In that case, I un-quit.
- I still quit, though.

10:21.254 --> 10:23.288
(shrieks)

10:23.290 --> 10:24.856
Ooh. (sighs happily)

10:32.966 --> 10:36.167
- Um, sorry, why am I here?
I gave you the keys.

10:36.169 --> 10:37.802
I'm taking the rest
of the summer off.

10:37.871 --> 10:39.637
- For your exit interview.

10:39.640 --> 10:40.805
If you ever need a letter
of referral,

10:40.874 --> 10:43.107
This is the standard procedure.

10:46.380 --> 10:48.112
Something's different
about you.

10:49.883 --> 10:52.483
Oh, my god, you had sex?

10:52.485 --> 10:54.953
With that biker guy I saw
at your trailer this morning?

10:55.088 --> 10:57.155
- It was a one-time thing.
- Well, that's a shame,

10:57.224 --> 10:58.823
'cause we could really use
the outlaw action

10:58.825 --> 11:01.292
To shake these suckers up.
- No, rhian, no.

11:01.294 --> 11:03.360
I already told you, our
criminal days are behind us.

11:06.199 --> 11:08.833
- (sniffles)
- are you okay, rhian?

11:09.970 --> 11:11.903
Oh, my god,
did you bring me here

11:11.905 --> 11:13.938
Because you wanted to talk?

11:13.974 --> 11:16.640
- It just feels like no one
is on my side.

11:16.677 --> 11:19.110
- Because you just
fired everyone.

11:19.146 --> 11:20.778
- Except for the baby
who's on the inside,

11:20.847 --> 11:23.048
Leeching my lifeforce.
- Honey...

11:23.183 --> 11:26.050
I remember that first trimester
overwhelm so well.

11:26.086 --> 11:28.987
- Why aren't we foxton cove
business association material?

11:28.989 --> 11:30.989
Stupid president,
katie frasier,

11:31.124 --> 11:33.992
With her stupid white car,
and her stupid crunchy hair.

11:34.127 --> 11:36.861
- Wait, wait, wait.
Thirsty... Katie?

11:36.863 --> 11:38.696
Is that all?
(laughs)

11:38.699 --> 11:40.432
We were besties in high school!

11:40.567 --> 11:43.334
Ha! Okay. Look, I know I said
I'd be hands off,

11:43.336 --> 11:44.802
But let me help you with this.

11:44.871 --> 11:46.971
Maybe I invite katie
to lobster-palooza,

11:47.107 --> 11:49.207
Reconnect, show her who we are!

11:49.209 --> 11:51.109
- Why would we wanna do that?

11:51.244 --> 11:53.211
- Leave it all to me, mama.

11:53.213 --> 11:55.013
I got this.

11:59.820 --> 12:01.619
(door opens, bell jingles)

12:04.557 --> 12:06.457
Katie: (whispers) you've got
to be kidding me.

12:06.493 --> 12:09.194
- What? Hold on! Katie?
- (gasps)

12:09.329 --> 12:12.263
- Is that you?
- Lidia! Oh my god!

12:12.398 --> 12:14.499
I had no idea you were home.

12:14.501 --> 12:16.434
- It's crazy bumping
into you like this!

12:16.569 --> 12:19.303
- Right? I mean a town of
200 people, who woulda thunk?

12:19.339 --> 12:20.905
- I see your billboards
all over town.

12:21.040 --> 12:23.107
Catchy slogan.
So, you and joel?

12:23.110 --> 12:25.009
- 20 years this fall.
- Oh.

12:25.011 --> 12:28.780
- I heard you had married
some hot jewish architect

12:28.849 --> 12:31.749
And had a big firm in nyc.
- Oh, technically brooklyn.

12:31.785 --> 12:34.618
He's... Half-jewish.
- Which half?

12:35.856 --> 12:37.588
- The right one.

12:37.624 --> 12:39.089
(both laugh and sigh)

12:43.496 --> 12:46.431
- So, how's it being back
in the trailer park?

12:46.566 --> 12:48.700
- You mean, idyllic,
ocean-side campground?

12:48.835 --> 12:50.535
- Of course.
- Never a dull moment.

12:50.670 --> 12:52.403
Lobster-palooza this weekend.

12:52.405 --> 12:55.139
Oh my god, you and joel
should totally come!

12:55.208 --> 12:57.442
- Hmm, I don't know,
busy season.

12:57.577 --> 12:58.943
- All you can eat lobster,

12:59.012 --> 13:01.312
Best sunsets on the shore.

13:01.381 --> 13:03.581
Open bar?
- (laughs)

13:03.716 --> 13:06.618
Remember when we used to sneak
our coolers up on the wharf?

13:06.753 --> 13:09.153
(laughs)
those were the days.

13:09.156 --> 13:11.288
Drinkin' our carbs, like we
were gonna live forever.

13:11.324 --> 13:13.024
- Slatherin' our faces
with baby oil,

13:13.093 --> 13:14.825
Like sun damage was something

13:14.861 --> 13:16.561
That only happened
to other people.

13:16.563 --> 13:18.162
- (laughs) we had some crazy
times.

13:18.165 --> 13:20.298
- Well, we still can.
We're gonna party

13:20.433 --> 13:22.767
Like it's 1999, biz-natch!

13:22.902 --> 13:25.336
- Okay, what the hell!
- That's the spirit.

13:25.471 --> 13:27.972
See ya there!
- All right, bye-bye.

13:28.107 --> 13:30.007
- Ooh yes!

13:30.043 --> 13:32.176
Ryan: You still work here, too?
Score.

13:32.212 --> 13:35.379
- Yep, 'til rhian's next
psychotic break.

13:35.448 --> 13:37.047
- Just a little
hair of the dog.

13:39.186 --> 13:41.619
You okay?
- Yeah! I'm just...

13:41.754 --> 13:44.122
Not really feeling lobster
palooza this year, that's all.

13:44.124 --> 13:46.124
- Feel bad for the beady-eyed
suckers, eh?

13:46.259 --> 13:48.526
Silent screaming thing
they do when they boil?

13:48.661 --> 13:51.529
- Um... It's really more
about the whole weekend

13:51.664 --> 13:53.898
I was left here, thing.
But--

13:53.900 --> 13:55.466
- Haven't been able to stop
thinking about

13:55.468 --> 13:57.201
What you said the other night.

13:57.237 --> 13:59.670
- That if you had to throw up,
you should do it in the sink.

13:59.805 --> 14:01.606
- About us finding out
who your bio mom is!

14:01.608 --> 14:04.675
- I uh... Actually put out
a couple feelers.

14:04.677 --> 14:07.211
I ordered one of those
genetic testing kit things

14:07.214 --> 14:08.879
And talked to terry.

14:08.915 --> 14:11.148
He's gonna run a dna search
through the police database.

14:11.150 --> 14:13.484
It'd only be a match if my
bio-parents were criminals,

14:13.553 --> 14:15.753
But fingers crossed?

14:15.822 --> 14:17.354
- Well, I can help search, too.

14:17.390 --> 14:19.156
Leave no stone unturned.

14:19.158 --> 14:21.092
Like detectives
who are also brothers.

14:21.094 --> 14:23.027
- Ryan--
- one has a drinking problem.

14:23.096 --> 14:25.229
- Oh my god.
- I'd watch that show.

14:25.298 --> 14:27.365
- Ryan, look, I really
appreciate the help.

14:27.434 --> 14:29.434
- No, sammy, I get it.

14:29.436 --> 14:31.469
You see me as the least
competent person you know.

14:31.604 --> 14:33.871
And you're right.
I definitely am.

14:34.006 --> 14:35.506
But don't forget,

14:35.642 --> 14:37.508
I was the one that found you
on that porch.

14:37.510 --> 14:39.911
I was there first.
I'm the missing link.

14:40.046 --> 14:41.812
- (scoffs)

14:41.848 --> 14:44.715
Actually, the term missing link
denotes uh...

14:44.784 --> 14:46.184
An extinct primate that--

14:46.319 --> 14:48.386
- You went to university,
we get it.

14:50.290 --> 14:52.790
- You really wanna help?
I got an idea.

14:54.461 --> 14:57.362
Lidia: Ugh!
- It's broken. I give up.

14:58.665 --> 15:00.664
- You've seriously never
cleaned this place before?

15:00.700 --> 15:02.833
(spray hisses)
it's impressive.

15:02.869 --> 15:05.669
- No one cared before terry.
If they did, I didn't care.

15:05.705 --> 15:07.939
It really bugs me that
he thinks I'm a slob.

15:08.008 --> 15:09.374
- Oh, because you love him.

15:09.509 --> 15:12.743
- He should love me!
Carpet mold and all.

15:12.779 --> 15:14.745
- Does terry wear glasses?

15:14.814 --> 15:16.613
- No, those are josh's.
- Who's josh?

15:16.650 --> 15:18.649
- Uh, this guy I slept with
for a while.

15:18.685 --> 15:20.484
He was really into slasher
movies

15:20.553 --> 15:22.219
In a way that made me nervous.

15:22.221 --> 15:24.188
- Did it ever occur to you
that maybe terry's upset

15:24.190 --> 15:26.090
Because this apartment
is a graveyard

15:26.159 --> 15:28.159
Of broken relationships?
- Men are so weird.

15:28.228 --> 15:30.461
- Oh yeah,
says the serial dater

15:30.497 --> 15:32.630
Who keeps trophies
from her victims.

15:32.699 --> 15:34.966
- I don't know why I've held on
to this stuff for so long.

15:35.035 --> 15:37.635
It's just proof of all
my bad decisions.

15:38.905 --> 15:40.738
Speaking of bad decisions,

15:40.807 --> 15:44.575
Are we really not talking about
your nocturnal sex-capade?

15:44.577 --> 15:46.444
(items clinks)

15:46.513 --> 15:48.779
What?
- It was incredible. Ha, ha!

15:48.848 --> 15:50.148
Both times.

15:50.283 --> 15:53.250
- You broke your post-daniel
seal, I'm proud of you.

15:53.320 --> 15:55.286
- There's a "but" coming.

15:55.288 --> 15:58.255
- Not that I haven't dated
my fair share of bad boys.

15:58.257 --> 16:01.658
- Don't worry, it was
a one-time thing. I think.

16:01.695 --> 16:03.694
I asked him to leave
this morning.

16:04.731 --> 16:06.197
Hope I didn't hurt
his feelings.

16:06.266 --> 16:07.932
- Well, I'm sure he's back
at his biker lair

16:08.067 --> 16:09.333
Journaling about it, right now.

16:09.402 --> 16:11.235
- You think he thinks
I'm slutty?

16:11.371 --> 16:12.903
- Who cares what he thinks?

16:12.939 --> 16:14.939
- I don't know why I'm asking
you for advice.

16:14.941 --> 16:16.340
You screwed pee-wee herman.

16:16.343 --> 16:18.509
- Which is why I am an expert
on random hook-ups.

16:18.545 --> 16:20.345
Screwing him is one thing.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.880
Getting into business with him
is next-level risky.

16:22.949 --> 16:26.284
- I'm not in business with him,
it's just a reno!

16:26.419 --> 16:27.952
Plus, I've been jonesing to lay

16:27.954 --> 16:29.887
Sweet, moroccan tiles
in a bathroom.

16:29.923 --> 16:31.489
Maybe taking them up
on to the wall.

16:31.558 --> 16:33.358
- For the love of god,
do not do that terrible,

16:33.493 --> 16:35.159
High-pitched squealy thing
you used to do in high school

16:35.228 --> 16:37.361
When you had a crush on a guy.
- What thing?

16:37.364 --> 16:40.631
I didn't do a thing. Ugh, god!
What is this? A chocolate--

16:40.633 --> 16:42.867
- Hockey puck! Melty mark!

16:43.002 --> 16:46.237
Oh, bad at birthday gifts.
Great at oral.

16:47.740 --> 16:49.707
- You need to examine this.

16:49.776 --> 16:54.212
♪♪♪

16:54.347 --> 16:56.180
- Mmm.

16:56.249 --> 16:58.749
Nom, nom, nom.

16:58.785 --> 17:00.350
- Anything?

17:00.387 --> 17:02.186
- I don't get how eating
this delicious lobster

17:02.255 --> 17:04.055
Is gonna help us find
your bio mom.

17:04.190 --> 17:06.924
Not that I'm complaining.
- It's called senso-biography.

17:06.993 --> 17:09.660
By recreating sense memories
from the day that you found me,

17:09.796 --> 17:12.997
We might be able to trigger
you know, some details,

17:13.132 --> 17:14.198
You might've forgotten.

17:14.333 --> 17:16.334
- Like a scavenger hunt
in my mind.

17:16.469 --> 17:18.302
- Exactly! Okay, let's start
with the location.

17:18.338 --> 17:20.337
- Hmm.
- This porch.

17:20.407 --> 17:22.239
- Do it.

17:26.679 --> 17:28.112
(light tap)
- okay. (sighs)

17:28.248 --> 17:29.747
Winds outta the east that day.
- East.

17:29.882 --> 17:31.782
- Nope. East.

17:31.851 --> 17:34.018
Moonshine woulda been
at capacity.

17:34.020 --> 17:35.986
(phone beeps on,
upbeat music plays)

17:36.022 --> 17:37.555
(indistinct chatter)
take a deep breath in.

17:37.624 --> 17:39.290
- (inhales)
- exhale.

17:39.292 --> 17:41.391
- (exhales deeply)

17:42.429 --> 17:44.629
- What do you see?
- Total darkness.

17:44.631 --> 17:47.231
- In your memory, ry!
- Oh! Right!

17:48.568 --> 17:50.435
It was hot.

17:50.570 --> 17:53.504
I was coming up from the beach
with my trusty bong,

17:53.506 --> 17:55.272
Le grand orange,

17:56.709 --> 17:58.909
And then, I heard a baby cry.

17:58.945 --> 18:01.379
I came to the porch,
and there you were.

18:01.514 --> 18:03.614
Cute as a button.

18:03.650 --> 18:05.916
- Okay, that's good.
That's really good.

18:05.985 --> 18:07.585
Now, look around.

18:07.654 --> 18:09.787
Did you maybe see anyone else?

18:09.922 --> 18:11.789
Maybe someone who looks
like me?

18:11.858 --> 18:13.791
- You mean drop-dead handsome,
with the best hair on the cove?

18:13.926 --> 18:16.827
No! I would for sure
remember that.

18:19.398 --> 18:21.665
(warbled voice) baby sammy.

18:21.734 --> 18:23.867
Baby sammy, where are you?

18:24.937 --> 18:27.405
Baby sammy...

18:29.909 --> 18:31.475
Nora: It's come to my attention

18:31.478 --> 18:34.411
That I may be a serial
relationship wrecker.

18:34.413 --> 18:36.881
It's got me thinking about
taking a critical gaze

18:36.883 --> 18:38.749
Back at myself.

18:38.885 --> 18:41.018
I have started dating someone
exclusively,

18:41.087 --> 18:42.753
Someone that I...

18:42.822 --> 18:44.621
Love,

18:44.657 --> 18:47.691
And I can already feel the cold
winds of romantic doom.

18:47.760 --> 18:50.761
So... I gotta ask my past,

18:52.565 --> 18:55.332
How do I not screw this one up?

18:56.369 --> 18:58.102
Okay...

18:59.906 --> 19:01.439
Duck bong guy. Kevin?

19:02.909 --> 19:04.775
Or... Carl?

19:06.112 --> 19:07.578
Can't remember your name,

19:07.614 --> 19:10.447
But I do remember getting so
high I thought I was dying.

19:10.449 --> 19:12.917
(call indicator beeps)
where did we go wrong?

19:12.919 --> 19:14.451
(call indicator beeps)

19:14.587 --> 19:16.921
Oh, uh...

19:16.923 --> 19:19.257
(clicks line)
hello, you're on the air.

19:19.259 --> 19:21.191
<i> Calvin: Nora? It's me, calvin.</i>

19:21.227 --> 19:23.194
<i> Duck bong guy! (laughs)</i>

19:23.263 --> 19:25.529
- Holy shit, that's it. Calvin!

19:25.598 --> 19:27.465
<i> - I just had to call in,</i>
<i> to tell you,</i>
