WEBVTT

00:00.033 --> 00:00.567
on "RuPaul's Drag Race"...

00:02.635 --> 00:06.006
You need to conduct one-on-one
interviews for "50/50."

00:07.107 --> 00:08.008
Get away from her...
both: You bitch!

00:08.608 --> 00:09.275
[laughter]

00:10.543 --> 00:11.011
- Cuchi, cuchi?
- [mouth full] Cuchi, cuchi.

00:11.878 --> 00:13.913
Grab the wheel! Oh, my God!

00:15.081 --> 00:15.348
[bad Italian accent]
We got the pizza going,

00:16.583 --> 00:17.217
and we're going to put it
in the oven.

00:18.084 --> 00:20.553
This is a hot-ass mess.

00:21.287 --> 00:21.955
Salina EsTitties.

00:22.689 --> 00:23.723
You kept talking over.

00:24.858 --> 00:26.659
Tell me the story
about a prosthetic leg.

00:27.527 --> 00:28.561
Malaysia Babydoll Foxx.

00:29.763 --> 00:32.098
It became his
interview of you.

00:32.732 --> 00:34.067
Sasha Colby.

00:35.268 --> 00:36.169
My favorite part, you
throwing the cards away.

00:36.936 --> 00:37.437
Who needs this?

00:38.838 --> 00:39.239
You're the winner
of this week's challenge.

00:39.873 --> 00:40.874
[applause]

00:42.108 --> 00:43.576
Salina EsTitties,
shantay, you stay.

00:44.344 --> 00:46.346
Malaysia Babydoll Foxx,

00:46.980 --> 00:48.615
sashay away.

00:50.650 --> 00:55.622
[dramatic music]

00:57.991 --> 00:59.059
Girl.

00:59.959 --> 01:00.527
We are back
in the workroom,

01:01.394 --> 01:01.995
and Malaysia's been eliminated.

01:03.063 --> 01:03.730
I've lost one
of the closest people

01:04.597 --> 01:05.031
to me in the competition.

01:06.199 --> 01:07.100
She's, like, the true
definition of a sister.

01:08.268 --> 01:09.269
We loved, we fought, but
at the end of the day,

01:10.470 --> 01:11.805
we still kiki-ed and
we cut the fuck up.

01:12.539 --> 01:13.039
"Remain humble.

01:14.240 --> 01:15.775
"The fattest and the
baddest from Miami,

01:16.509 --> 01:18.044
Malaysia Babydoll Foxx."

01:19.512 --> 01:21.481
- Babydoll, Babydoll, Babydoll.
- Miss Salina, how you feeling?

01:22.682 --> 01:23.183
So, before I was
only in the bottom

01:24.317 --> 01:24.551
because, like,
design challenges.

01:25.585 --> 01:25.985
So it's only
the designs, you know?

01:27.387 --> 01:28.321
But now I'm officially
a bottom bitch, and, like,

01:29.055 --> 01:29.522
I didn't come into here

01:30.590 --> 01:31.224
thinking I was going
to be that.

01:32.592 --> 01:32.725
Bitch, this is my
first time in the bottom,

01:34.127 --> 01:34.761
and I thought I was going to
be the one lip-synching.

01:36.196 --> 01:37.464
So, like, you got to shake
it off and just keep going.

01:38.665 --> 01:40.433
I don't think I did
that bad last week.

01:41.334 --> 01:41.868
Oh, bitch, that was quick.

01:42.635 --> 01:43.069
She knows her way

01:44.370 --> 01:44.571
around cleaning the mirror
at this point.

01:45.939 --> 01:46.506
I don't feel like the girls
see me as competition

01:47.674 --> 01:48.074
because I've been
in the bottom so much.

01:49.142 --> 01:49.609
But, listen,
I've allowed my light

01:50.710 --> 01:51.177
to be dimmed
up until this point.

01:51.945 --> 01:52.345
But, baby, not no more.

01:53.546 --> 01:54.747
No more
Mrs. Nice EsTitties, okay?

01:56.116 --> 01:58.184
She's coming out to play.
Let's go, bitches.

01:59.619 --> 02:00.720
Congratulations, auntie,
on your third win, babe.

02:01.821 --> 02:03.123
- You got it together.
- Thank y'all.

02:03.990 --> 02:05.125
Three maxi challenge wins.

02:06.259 --> 02:07.026
I mean, I really
felt like y'all were,

02:07.760 --> 02:08.328
like, going to be ahead.

02:09.462 --> 02:11.364
- How do you all feel?
- I'm surprised.

02:12.499 --> 02:13.833
- Yeah.
- I really expected to win.

02:14.567 --> 02:15.768
[music continues]

02:16.503 --> 02:17.003
Are we that shocked?

02:18.138 --> 02:19.139
Loosey thinks she
should win every week.

02:20.073 --> 02:20.406
I'm definitely
seeing me being

02:21.574 --> 02:23.209
this close to a win
as, like, okay, bitch,

02:24.377 --> 02:25.278
you have to get
the win next time.

02:26.412 --> 02:28.348
I hear the judges
telling me that I have

02:29.282 --> 02:30.316
what it takes to
go all the way.

02:31.451 --> 02:32.719
I'm, like, right
behind Sasha, who is

02:33.586 --> 02:34.154
technically the front-runner.

02:35.221 --> 02:35.622
But I think
I'm the front-runner

02:36.956 --> 02:38.057
in terms of charisma,
uniqueness, nerve, and talent.

02:39.459 --> 02:41.628
So, statistically, I want
to be in second place,

02:43.096 --> 02:45.398
but I'm always going to
be in first place up here.

02:46.299 --> 02:48.168
How about we get out of drag?

02:49.536 --> 02:50.003
But don't get too comfy,
because the queen

02:51.004 --> 02:52.005
is coming for her crown,
yes, God.

02:52.639 --> 02:53.406
Yes, I am.

02:54.541 --> 02:55.608
I said the queen,
not the beast.

02:56.509 --> 02:57.243
- I know.
- Ooh! Beast?

02:58.378 --> 03:00.446
I'm sure Loosey
and Luxx have the most

03:01.848 --> 03:02.715
fire under their asses, 'cause
they were both on the top

03:03.883 --> 03:04.984
and they both felt like
they should have won,

03:06.085 --> 03:07.620
and they smell
blood in the water.

03:08.988 --> 03:11.090
And it's three girls
away from the final four.

03:12.425 --> 03:14.727
Like, that's crazy
motivation for all of us.

03:15.195 --> 03:17.263
It's on.

03:18.298 --> 03:20.466
Is that Joey Jay?
[laughter]

03:21.668 --> 03:23.036
I'm a gay-ass bit--
I am a gay-ass bitch.

03:23.636 --> 03:26.506
[laughter]

03:27.373 --> 03:27.674
[singing] "RuPaul's Drag Race"

03:28.641 --> 03:29.209
The winner
of "RuPaul's Drag Race"

03:30.076 --> 03:30.543
receives a one-year supply

03:31.744 --> 03:33.279
of Anastasia Beverly Hills cosmetics

03:34.347 --> 03:36.649
and a gag-worthy
grand prize of $200,000

03:37.383 --> 03:38.051
served by Cash App.

03:39.185 --> 03:40.887
With extra-special
guest judge Ali Wong.

03:42.288 --> 03:44.224
[singing] "RuPaul's Drag Race,"
may the best drag queen win

03:44.958 --> 03:46.492
Best drag queen win

03:47.560 --> 03:51.397
[upbeat music]

03:52.298 --> 03:53.499
Oh, not Kelly and Michelle.

03:54.701 --> 03:55.635
It is a new day
in the workroom.

03:56.769 --> 03:58.972
We are top seven, which
is something I never

03:59.839 --> 04:00.873
thought I'd be able to say.

04:02.208 --> 04:02.508
That's not true. That's a big
lie that I just told,

04:03.376 --> 04:03.943
so I'm going to do it again.

04:04.811 --> 04:07.313
[gasps] Kelly and Michelle.

04:08.481 --> 04:09.148
They're wearing more
makeup than Marcia.

04:09.882 --> 04:10.850
[gasps] - Shut up.

04:11.985 --> 04:13.686
Ha ha ha ha, Marcia
doesn't wear any makeup.

04:14.153 --> 04:15.855
Whoo.

04:17.056 --> 04:18.725
- Beyoncé looks are really fun.
- I loved mine.

04:19.692 --> 04:20.393
- Yeah.
- It was so sickening.

04:21.261 --> 04:21.761
I loved wearing my look.

04:22.862 --> 04:23.263
I felt really, really
beautiful in it.

04:24.464 --> 04:25.565
Why weren't you
pregnant, though?

04:26.699 --> 04:27.734
She wasn't very
far along when

04:28.601 --> 04:29.369
she announced her pregnancy.

04:30.803 --> 04:31.571
You could see the bump on the
red carpet in the orange dress

04:32.972 --> 04:33.306
and you could see it in the
performance, sweetheart.

04:34.707 --> 04:36.109
I feel like you're insulting
me right now, and, like--

04:37.176 --> 04:37.610
No, I'm not insulting
her because she

04:38.344 --> 04:38.945
actually was pregnant.

04:40.413 --> 04:41.414
I'm insulting you because
you had a corset on, so...

04:42.348 --> 04:42.949
Literally Google
the performance.

04:43.816 --> 04:45.051
She was rubbing her baby bump.

04:46.219 --> 04:47.987
Yeah, but Beyoncé
has body, body, body.

04:49.155 --> 04:49.455
So I wanted to give
body, body, body.

04:50.189 --> 04:50.657
And belly bump.

04:51.824 --> 04:52.458
Wait, you didn't
have body on either.

04:53.826 --> 04:55.094
- You didn't have Beyoncé body.
- I had Beyoncé body on.

04:56.229 --> 04:56.896
Like the Luxx version
of the Beyoncé body.

04:57.363 --> 04:58.264
Yeah.

04:59.632 --> 04:59.866
So why can't I do the Loosey
version of Beyoncé body?

05:01.034 --> 05:01.701
Because I feel like
if you're pregnant,

05:02.435 --> 05:03.569
you should be pregnant.

05:04.737 --> 05:07.674
I'm just like, let
the unraveling begin.

05:08.775 --> 05:10.710
But she wasn't showing
in her pregnancy.

05:11.577 --> 05:11.811
You could go back and look.

05:12.979 --> 05:13.279
I don't have to,
because I know.

05:14.380 --> 05:15.148
I know, too, because
I did the look.

05:16.349 --> 05:18.051
I came in second last week.
She didn't.

05:18.918 --> 05:19.419
So I don't really understand

05:20.620 --> 05:21.521
why she's
trying to sort of read me.

05:22.388 --> 05:23.823
But we all know the deal.

05:24.991 --> 05:28.361
Talent gets you to the
finale, not mind games.

05:29.595 --> 05:31.397
- [alarm blaring, all shout]
- Ooh, girl.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.667
She done already
done had herses.

05:35.568 --> 05:36.002
Yeah.
[laughter]

05:37.203 --> 05:40.239
My queens, pardon my
French and Saunders,

05:41.341 --> 05:43.609
but the Key and Peele
to making comedy

05:44.944 --> 05:47.447
is to know when to
Cheech and when to Chong.

05:48.781 --> 05:50.783
Now, go back to Broad City
where you belong.

05:51.918 --> 05:53.086
- Oh, my God.
- Definitely duos.

05:53.953 --> 05:55.121
- Comedy duos.
- Yeah.

05:55.855 --> 05:56.823
Hello, hello, hello.

05:57.423 --> 05:57.757
[all exclaiming]

05:58.624 --> 05:59.792
She's Miss Harley Queen.

06:00.960 --> 06:03.596
Ladykins, America's
next drag superstar

06:04.764 --> 06:06.099
needs to have all
the right moves.

06:06.966 --> 06:08.568
So for today's mini challenge,

06:09.669 --> 06:12.739
we're going to celebrate
a queer art form.

06:13.339 --> 06:15.074
Yes, yes, yes.

06:16.542 --> 06:20.012
We are throwing ourselves a
Harlem vogue ball, darling.

06:20.480 --> 06:21.848
[laughs]

06:23.015 --> 06:24.083
I am looking for
popping, dipping,

06:24.817 --> 06:26.853
and spinning, sha-blam.

06:27.453 --> 06:27.954
Fierce.

06:28.688 --> 06:29.522
All of it, darlings.

06:30.923 --> 06:34.494
You've got 15 minutes to
get into quick voguing drag.

06:35.361 --> 06:35.895
So don't just stand there.

06:36.496 --> 06:37.530
Let's get to it.

06:38.598 --> 06:40.166
Death drop.
[all scream, laugh]

06:41.300 --> 06:42.635
I have nothing to
wear for this challenge.

06:45.438 --> 06:46.873
Nipple ring.

06:47.607 --> 06:49.675
[music continues]

06:50.910 --> 06:53.613
Calling all
the up-and-coming children.

06:54.781 --> 06:58.518
Category is
I'm So Into Voguing Right Now.

06:59.118 --> 06:59.652

Luxx Noir London.

07:06.692 --> 07:08.795
Ooh!

Work, hey.

07:12.865 --> 07:14.600

Loosey LaDuca.

07:22.608 --> 07:24.710
No foam here.
[laughter]

07:25.445 --> 07:26.179
I'm just kidding.

07:27.380 --> 07:28.047
Loosey's been saying
the whole competition,

07:28.915 --> 07:30.716
"I got tricks, I got tricks."

07:31.651 --> 07:33.252
Baby, she pulled
out a cartwheel.

07:34.921 --> 07:37.623
Butch-queen realness.

07:38.090 --> 07:41.394

[cheering]

07:49.168 --> 07:50.503
[music continues]

07:51.637 --> 07:54.240
Salina is, like,
flopping side to side.

07:55.107 --> 07:55.508
Someone's going to get hit.

07:56.642 --> 07:59.345
- What is happening?
- Banjee girl realness.

08:00.513 --> 08:03.983
From the Brady Dynasty,

08:07.253 --> 08:08.254

Yes, all of New York is
wrapped up in you, darling.

08:13.059 --> 08:15.161
From the

08:42.588 --> 08:46.158
Class is in session

08:47.059 --> 08:47.994
Yes, bae.
Come on, bae.

08:48.461 --> 08:50.663
Ooh!

08:51.831 --> 08:53.065
Ooh, I guess she
forgot to shave.

08:53.799 --> 08:55.968
[music continues]

08:56.702 --> 08:57.370
Put it on, bitch.

08:58.104 --> 09:00.273
Go beat that mug, bitch.

Category closed.

09:44.150 --> 09:46.852
Category is closed.

09:47.320 --> 09:50.222
Wow.

09:51.390 --> 09:54.594
Okay, queens, I saw
stars and statements.

09:55.461 --> 09:58.898
But one of you was a legend.

09:59.498 --> 10:01.334
Oh, pit crew?

10:01.934 --> 10:03.803
[epic music]

10:04.403 --> 10:05.237
[all gasp]

10:06.405 --> 10:06.806
Careful, you're gonna
put somebody's eyes out

10:07.406 --> 10:07.807
with that thing.

10:08.541 --> 10:09.742
I wish he would.

10:10.977 --> 10:12.345
The winner
of today's mini challenge,

10:13.512 --> 10:15.648
snatching
the grand prize trophy is...

10:16.248 --> 10:18.684
[drumroll]

10:19.518 --> 10:20.820
Anetra.
[all cheering]

10:21.687 --> 10:23.456
[upbeat electronic music]

10:24.056 --> 10:25.358
Condragulations.

10:26.325 --> 10:29.862
You've won a cash prize
of $2,500.

10:30.363 --> 10:33.232
Ah!

10:33.866 --> 10:35.134
Oh.
Oh, no.

10:36.035 --> 10:38.170
My queens, drag reminds us

10:39.071 --> 10:41.807
to not take life too seriously.

10:42.708 --> 10:43.676
So, for today's maxi challenge,

10:44.910 --> 10:48.080
Bubly wants us all
to crack a smile,

10:49.281 --> 10:50.583
because you'll be
performing stand-up

10:52.051 --> 10:55.221
in front of a live audience
at the Bubly Comedy Festival.

10:55.921 --> 10:57.223
- Wow.
- Wow.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.059
Now, I wouldn't consider
myself a stand-up comic,

11:01.227 --> 11:02.061
but I do love some
sit-down comedy.

11:02.662 --> 11:03.429
[chuckles]

11:05.131 --> 11:06.799
It's too funny.

11:07.400 --> 11:10.202
Oh, pit crew?

11:10.803 --> 11:12.304
I'm parched.

11:13.172 --> 11:15.041
What you got in that trunk?

11:16.242 --> 11:18.644
Now, to randomly divide
you into comedy duos...

11:19.245 --> 11:20.112
[all gasp]

11:21.280 --> 11:21.814
You need to reach
into this cooler

11:23.149 --> 11:25.985
and pull out a can
of Bubly sparkling water.

11:27.053 --> 11:28.054
All right, up first,
Sasha Colby.

11:28.921 --> 11:31.123
Come pick your Bubly drink.

11:31.724 --> 11:33.693
No peeking.

11:34.293 --> 11:35.961
Sasha has mango.

11:37.163 --> 11:38.831
Up next,
it's Marcia Marcia Marcia.

11:39.331 --> 11:39.965
Oh.

11:40.933 --> 11:43.335
- Marcia has blackberry.
- Ooh.

11:44.103 --> 11:45.604
[music continues]

11:46.372 --> 11:47.406
Ooh, Loosey got lime.

11:48.174 --> 11:51.143
Luxx Noir London...

11:51.911 --> 11:54.380
Luxx, you've got lime.

11:55.281 --> 11:56.082
That means you're with Loosey.

11:57.183 --> 11:57.650
I feel like
Loosey may struggle

11:58.517 --> 11:58.818
with this being with Luxx.

11:59.418 --> 11:59.985
Oh, my God!

12:01.053 --> 12:01.887
Weren't they fighting
this morning?

12:02.354 --> 12:03.956
[laughs]

12:04.690 --> 12:05.658
And they're together.

12:06.258 --> 12:08.194
[giggles]

12:08.928 --> 12:11.864
Salina EsTitties.

12:12.598 --> 12:14.967
Salina got cherry.

12:15.701 --> 12:17.536
Anetra, you got mango.

12:18.404 --> 12:19.839
That means you are with Sasha.

12:20.706 --> 12:22.808
Mistress, pick your poison.

12:23.943 --> 12:24.477
I am praying to
the drag gods

12:25.878 --> 12:27.213
that I will be with a good
team this time, bitch.

12:28.380 --> 12:30.449
I am ready for my
redemption era.

12:31.317 --> 12:32.485
Mistress got blackberry.

12:33.219 --> 12:34.854
So she is with Marcia.

12:35.454 --> 12:37.323
Oh, my bestie.

12:38.524 --> 12:41.093
Now, Salina, you
alone have cherry.

12:41.827 --> 12:43.062
You have a choice.

12:43.963 --> 12:45.631
You can choose to perform solo,

12:46.532 --> 12:49.702
or you can steal a partner

12:50.603 --> 12:53.139
from one of the paired queens.

12:53.639 --> 12:55.307
Ooh.

12:56.475 --> 12:58.544
There is a positive
and a very big negative

12:59.678 --> 13:00.613
to going solo
in this challenge.

13:01.781 --> 13:02.681
On one hand, I can
really impress them

13:03.549 --> 13:04.183
and, like, get a redemption.

13:05.050 --> 13:06.051
On the other, it can go south,

13:07.052 --> 13:08.053
and it's no one's fault
but my own.

13:08.921 --> 13:11.657
So, Salina, what say you?

13:12.391 --> 13:13.726
I'll steal a queen.

13:14.326 --> 13:15.895
[dramatic music]

13:16.996 --> 13:18.063
Two titties are
better than one titty.

13:18.664 --> 13:19.131
All right.

13:20.299 --> 13:22.835
Which queen do you
choose to steal?

13:23.702 --> 13:24.937
I'll take Mistress over here.

13:25.404 --> 13:27.106
Ooh.

13:28.274 --> 13:30.409
Oh, I'm sorry, bestie.
I know you wanted me.

13:31.010 --> 13:31.610
[laughter]

13:32.645 --> 13:33.646
That means
Marcia Marcia Marcia,

13:34.847 --> 13:36.749
you'll be working
solo, solo, solo.

13:39.919 --> 13:41.187
[chuckles]

13:42.354 --> 13:43.956
Anetra, because you
won the mini challenge,

13:45.291 --> 13:47.827
you get to decide
the order of performance.

13:48.961 --> 13:51.397
Later today you'll
workshop your material

13:52.164 --> 13:53.766
with Michelle Visage

13:54.834 --> 13:56.001
and our extra-special
guest judge,

13:56.869 --> 13:58.304
comedy sensation Ali Wong.

13:59.238 --> 14:02.141
- [all gasp]
- Shut up.

14:03.576 --> 14:07.112
Racers, start your engines,
and may the best queen win.

14:10.216 --> 14:11.750
Cheers to me.

14:12.618 --> 14:13.219
Out of all the challenges,

14:14.553 --> 14:15.955
this is the one that
I'm the most nervous about.

14:16.422 --> 14:17.489
Fuck.

14:19.658 --> 14:22.595
Oh, my God, Anetra,
I love your hair today.

14:23.329 --> 14:24.163
Lay it on us, girl.

14:25.564 --> 14:28.234
This week's maxi challenge
is a stand-up-comedy challenge.

14:29.635 --> 14:32.171
Anetra gets to pick the
lineup for the comedy show.

14:33.372 --> 14:34.406
Now, this can make
or break your act.

14:35.841 --> 14:37.042
If you are starting and
you don't have a good act,

14:37.910 --> 14:38.410
it's really going to bomb.

14:39.812 --> 14:40.980
And if you go last and
you don't have a good act,

14:41.847 --> 14:42.915
it's really going to bomb.

14:43.782 --> 14:44.149
All right, what's the sitch?

14:45.384 --> 14:47.519
- So, opening, we have Marcia.
- [gasps] Great.

14:48.120 --> 14:48.954
I know myself.

14:49.855 --> 14:50.389
If I were to go
in the middle,

14:51.824 --> 14:52.992
I would be sitting in the
chair running it in my head

14:53.859 --> 14:54.460
over and over and over again.

14:55.794 --> 14:57.429
So I'm really happy
I just get to, like, do it,

14:58.030 --> 14:58.898
and I'm done.

15:00.332 --> 15:02.167
Next will be Luxx and
Loosey, then Sasha and I.

15:03.302 --> 15:05.638
And closing, we have
the divalicious divas...

15:07.039 --> 15:08.240
- Okay, I'm down with it.
- Mistress and Salina.

15:09.341 --> 15:10.109
What was your, like,
plan of, like--

15:11.243 --> 15:11.777
- Process.
- Yeah, what was your process

15:12.645 --> 15:13.946
of choosing us in that lineup?

15:15.414 --> 15:16.248
I don't have to tell y'all
nothing if I don't want to.

15:16.849 --> 15:17.516
all: Ooh!

15:18.651 --> 15:19.952
She said, we're
down to seven, henny.

15:21.420 --> 15:22.421
Oh, thank God my Anetra
tattoo was only temporary.

15:23.022 --> 15:23.956
[laughter]

15:25.324 --> 15:27.092
Miss Anetra was very
strategic with her lineup.

15:28.294 --> 15:29.561
- Thanks, Aneech.
- Thank you, girl.

15:30.696 --> 15:31.797
I always prefer to
be right in the middle,

15:32.665 --> 15:33.098
because I think we've all been

15:34.166 --> 15:35.100
to those really, really
long drag shows

15:36.235 --> 15:37.436
that seem to go on
and on and on,

15:38.637 --> 15:40.539
but we are going to
make the most of it.

15:41.407 --> 15:41.974
Have you ever done stand-up?

15:42.841 --> 15:43.309
I've never done stand-up,

15:44.543 --> 15:46.078
but people just
say that I'm funny sometimes.

15:46.946 --> 15:48.280
I get paired with Loosey.

15:49.581 --> 15:52.584
And despite our little
tiff-taff at the table earlier,

15:53.752 --> 15:54.720
I know that Loosey
wouldn't tell me

15:55.587 --> 15:56.088
that my bad joke is funny

15:57.523 --> 15:58.657
because we both want to win
this challenge this week.

15:59.825 --> 16:00.459
I really think that
the judges are looking

16:01.327 --> 16:02.428
for us to have chemistry.

16:03.462 --> 16:05.497
It could be
kind of, like, roasty.

16:06.665 --> 16:07.599
I can find something
to compliment about you.

16:08.701 --> 16:09.368
I can say, oh, you're
looking so trim

16:10.102 --> 16:10.636
or something like that.

16:11.737 --> 16:12.871
And we can come up
with some type of a joke

16:13.605 --> 16:14.073
for you to say, like...

16:15.274 --> 16:15.941
Goddamn tapeworm,
gets me every time.

16:17.910 --> 16:19.278
Okay, I'm liking this.

16:20.145 --> 16:20.646
This is Luxx Noir Paris--

16:21.547 --> 16:22.114
uh, Detroit--
uh, London?

16:23.148 --> 16:24.216
London.
Luxx Noir London.

16:25.084 --> 16:25.751
And this is Lookey Da--

16:26.618 --> 16:27.052
I mean Loosey, you're safe--

16:27.920 --> 16:29.288
I mean Loosey.
[laughter]

16:30.022 --> 16:30.622
I find it so funny

16:31.824 --> 16:32.524
that Loosey and Luxx
are paired together,

16:33.892 --> 16:34.393
because they are two
of the thirstiest bitches

16:35.127 --> 16:35.761
left in the competition,

16:37.129 --> 16:38.230
and they both would do
anything to secure that win.

16:39.298 --> 16:40.265
So this will be
very interesting to see

16:41.000 --> 16:42.334
how this plays out.

16:43.769 --> 16:44.636
The competition has been
a lot like puberty for me...

16:46.071 --> 16:49.308
a lot like puberty in that
I'm super uncomfortable.

16:50.676 --> 16:52.277
Poor Marcia's over
there talking to herself.

16:53.379 --> 16:54.013
You talking to yourself
over there, girl?

16:55.114 --> 16:56.115
- I have to.
- I know. [laughs]

16:57.049 --> 16:57.182
Marcia, do you
feel like Salina

16:58.050 --> 16:58.784
meant to put you by yourself?

16:59.985 --> 17:01.353
Let me come over.
Let me talk to you.

17:02.421 --> 17:04.089
Just know I have
no ill will toward you.

17:05.491 --> 17:06.291
I feel like I might have done
the same thing, honestly.

17:06.892 --> 17:07.526
No, yeah.

17:08.727 --> 17:08.861
Because, you know,
she's a funny bitch.

17:09.895 --> 17:11.597
So I get it.
I totally understand.

17:12.331 --> 17:14.133
I'm a little panicked.

17:15.200 --> 17:17.002
It feels almost
as if my training wheels

17:18.303 --> 17:19.271
have been taken off,
and I'm riding my two-wheeler

17:20.005 --> 17:20.572
for the first time.

17:21.874 --> 17:24.309
I'm either going to hit it
out of the park,

17:25.044 --> 17:25.611
or I'm going to flop.

17:26.779 --> 17:28.747
And I do not know which
one it's going to be.

17:31.050 --> 17:33.419
I was just thinking,
as far as maybe a layout,

17:34.286 --> 17:35.788
I could thank Loosey and Luxx,

17:37.156 --> 17:39.191
and then you could get a bit--
however long you want--

17:40.492 --> 17:41.760
and then we could do
a bunch of those canned bits.

17:44.096 --> 17:45.464
I'm sorry,

17:46.632 --> 17:47.132
'cause , honestly, all
I can think of right now

17:48.267 --> 17:49.601
is this, like,
splitting migraine

17:50.736 --> 17:51.503
- that's happening in my head.
- Yeah.

17:52.571 --> 17:53.639
I'm not really feeling
great right now.

17:55.107 --> 17:57.176
As soon as I, like, sat down,
I started to notice my vision

17:58.277 --> 17:59.445
was getting really
spotty in my right eye.

18:00.646 --> 18:02.281
And it literally feels
like if somebody were

18:03.148 --> 18:04.383
to just press on my forehead,

18:05.684 --> 18:07.419
my entire brain
would just, like, explode.

18:08.587 --> 18:09.121
Like, how my head
feels right now

18:10.522 --> 18:11.523
is how that old lady felt
when Laganja was like,

18:12.658 --> 18:13.392
"It's kind of
like your vagina."

18:14.660 --> 18:16.428
But I don't want to,
like, stop working.

18:17.429 --> 18:18.430
Yeah.
Is it getting worse?

18:19.031 --> 18:21.133
[dramatic music]

18:22.935 --> 18:25.637
I feel bad for Sasha
because I'm not really

18:26.772 --> 18:28.173
as useful as I, like,
normally would be.

18:29.475 --> 18:30.609
- I'm gonna grab an aspirin.
- Get your life.

18:31.343 --> 18:31.777
I'll be right back.

18:32.878 --> 18:33.245
The headache is
really taking over her,

18:34.413 --> 18:35.781
where she's not really
coming up with anything.

18:36.815 --> 18:38.617
And this is
about teamwork, so...

18:39.651 --> 18:40.586
[sighs] I don't know.
I'm nervous.

18:43.322 --> 18:45.157
- Look who's here.
- Hi.

18:45.624 --> 18:46.358
Hi.

18:47.559 --> 18:48.660
It's time for me to meet
with the comedy coaches,

18:49.528 --> 18:50.929
Michelle Visage and Ali Wong.

18:51.663 --> 18:52.531
I love her so much.

18:53.398 --> 18:54.133
It's a little intimidating.

18:54.733 --> 18:55.334
Hi, Marcia.

18:56.535 --> 18:57.302
I'm so excited to
see what you have.

18:58.170 --> 18:59.571
I have a pretty solid chunk.

19:00.639 --> 19:02.407
"Solid chunk,"
sounds like a fat stool.

19:03.008 --> 19:05.210
[laughter]

19:06.345 --> 19:06.612
All right, Marcia,
let's go for it.

19:07.613 --> 19:08.280
Okay, so I'm opening
the show.

19:09.314 --> 19:10.115
Oh, shit,
you're doing it alone,

19:11.283 --> 19:11.817
- and you're opening the show?
- Mm-hmm.

19:13.185 --> 19:14.119
The big advantage
is you don't have to worry

19:15.287 --> 19:16.588
about someone else
doing the same bit.

19:17.556 --> 19:18.123
- Exactly.
- Because if they do...

19:18.724 --> 19:19.258
[snaps fingers]

19:20.392 --> 19:20.792
I went first,
and they copied me.

19:21.693 --> 19:22.528
- [laughter]
- I love it.

19:23.395 --> 19:24.163
All right, Marcia, hit it.

19:25.330 --> 19:26.265
We have to start
with Mother RuPaul.

19:27.399 --> 19:28.000
RuPaul reminds me
of Cinderella.

19:28.901 --> 19:30.702
She's beautiful,
she is blonde,

19:31.970 --> 19:32.337
she always has a little raven
flying around her,

19:33.472 --> 19:34.973
- fixing her outfits.
- [laughs] True.

19:35.707 --> 19:36.208
And you can't forget--

19:37.509 --> 19:38.844
she's sat beside
her two evil stepsisters.

19:39.444 --> 19:40.445
Yes, yes.

19:41.747 --> 19:42.114
Ross Matthews and
Carson Kressley unfortunately

19:42.981 --> 19:43.582
could not be here tonight.

19:44.983 --> 19:46.218
They were recently cast in
a remake of "The Parent Trap."

19:46.818 --> 19:49.154
[upbeat music]

19:50.222 --> 19:51.823
- Like they're the twins.
- Not so funny.

19:52.891 --> 19:53.358
You can think of
something funnier there.

19:54.026 --> 19:54.426
- Okay.
- Yeah.

19:55.561 --> 19:55.961
Something that
doesn't make sense.

19:57.296 --> 19:57.529
Maybe going with
something really serious,

19:58.997 --> 19:59.665
like they're in rehearsal
for "Death of a Salesman."

20:00.265 --> 20:01.867
S-s-s-sure.

20:03.001 --> 20:03.902
They're in rehearsal
for "Magic Mike."

20:05.037 --> 20:06.071
- That is very funny.
- I could see it.

20:06.939 --> 20:07.773
And then do the logline.

20:08.907 --> 20:10.442
Like, "Magic Mike,"
they've lost the magic.

20:11.176 --> 20:12.110
The magic is gone.

20:13.278 --> 20:14.613
- Magic is gone.
- That's the one.

20:15.747 --> 20:18.016
Oh, my goodness.
Look at this.

20:19.184 --> 20:19.985
Have you ever
done comedy, Luxx?

20:21.386 --> 20:22.354
Never, but people tell me
I'm funny all the time.

20:23.555 --> 20:24.389
But looks aren't
everything, Luxx.

20:25.390 --> 20:26.024
Loosey--
Thank you very much.

20:27.192 --> 20:28.694
That was my comedy.
I'll be here all week.

20:29.828 --> 20:30.229
Loosey, have you
ever done stand-up?

20:31.496 --> 20:32.130
- Yes, I do a lot of stand-up.
- Do you? Great.

20:33.498 --> 20:35.267
- But I always do it solo.
- Thank you, Luxx.

20:36.668 --> 20:38.170
- Are you ready to show us?
- Yeah, I think so.

20:39.338 --> 20:40.872
I heard that you
have a sugar daddy?

20:41.640 --> 20:43.041
[gasps] A sugar daddy.

20:43.809 --> 20:44.209
Yeah, I actually do.

20:45.344 --> 20:46.678
He's really nice.
I think he has a friend.

20:48.146 --> 20:49.248
He really has a thing for
white girls with no rhythm.

20:50.148 --> 20:50.582
For white girls with what?

20:51.650 --> 20:52.684
- No rhythm.
- Oh, no rhythm. Okay.

20:53.452 --> 20:54.219
I don't want to lose

20:55.420 --> 20:56.188
any of these, like, great lines
you're saying.

20:57.456 --> 20:58.123
So just make sure to, like,
take your time,

20:59.224 --> 20:59.958
'cause that's
a great punch line.

21:00.892 --> 21:01.526
Do you have no rhythm,
Loosey?

21:02.394 --> 21:03.695
No.
[laughter]

21:05.130 --> 21:06.231
- We saw you earlier, girl.
- I think I have rhythm.

21:06.965 --> 21:07.566
But do you really?

21:08.433 --> 21:10.068
I won in LaLaPaRuza, so...

21:10.669 --> 21:12.404
Oh, my God.

21:13.538 --> 21:14.373
How are you making
money nowadays?

21:15.507 --> 21:16.308
I mean, I don't mean
to embarrass you

21:17.442 --> 21:18.677
in front of all
of your fan, but I--

21:19.544 --> 21:21.079
- [laughter]
- Very funny.

21:22.648 --> 21:23.649
Is that okay to say?

21:24.449 --> 21:24.883
- No, it's fine.
- Okay.

21:26.051 --> 21:26.985
If I got laugh, baby,
it's going to stay.

21:27.986 --> 21:28.287
Oh, yeah, no, girl,
of course.

21:29.488 --> 21:29.988
I hear he really has a
thing for white girls

21:30.589 --> 21:30.989
with no rhythm.

21:31.723 --> 21:32.090
Again, I couldn't--

21:33.025 --> 21:33.525
- I lost you on "rhythm."
- Okay.

21:34.660 --> 21:36.461
Luxx needs to work
on slowing down.

21:37.329 --> 21:38.297
This is a group challenge.

21:39.665 --> 21:41.733
We either succeed together,
or we fail together.

21:43.135 --> 21:43.669
We're basically going
to tell, like, hook-up stories

21:44.903 --> 21:46.104
that go wrong
because of our drag personas.

21:46.872 --> 21:47.372
Oh, that's unique.

21:48.540 --> 21:49.675
Salina's playing coy.
She's a nasty bitch.

21:51.076 --> 21:51.209
That's why I wanted to go
with this direction,

21:51.977 --> 21:52.344
because it's real,

21:53.578 --> 21:53.779
and, like, even if we slip up
on our notes,

21:54.680 --> 21:54.880
it's a story we could tell

21:56.014 --> 21:56.148
because it's really happened
to us.

21:56.782 --> 21:57.282
Okay, good.

21:58.450 --> 21:58.583
All right, well,
let's give it a go.

21:59.751 --> 22:00.819
I was craving
a little Mexican,

22:00.919 --> 22:02.754
so I found me a
sickening papi, bitch.

22:03.488 --> 22:04.156
I dimmed the lights,

22:05.524 --> 22:06.692
and I played some seductive
music to set the tone.

22:08.126 --> 22:09.461
Ooh, what's your favorite
song to go get freaky to?

22:10.429 --> 22:12.264
"Geronimo" by RuPaul.
[laughter]

22:12.998 --> 22:13.465
I think I'm funny,

22:14.533 --> 22:15.367
and the coaches
are definitely laughing.

22:16.568 --> 22:18.303
Bitch, it is time
for my winner era.

22:19.571 --> 22:19.871
Girl, right,
like this one time, right,

22:20.739 --> 22:21.373
I was at a Christmas party,

22:22.541 --> 22:24.042
and I was dressed as
a pregnant Mrs. Claus

22:25.043 --> 22:26.178
with a prosthetic belly
out to here.

22:27.612 --> 22:28.680
And, baby, there was this fine
piece of trade eyeballing me

22:29.414 --> 22:30.048
from across the room.

22:31.483 --> 22:32.117
My phone was disconnected,
so I gave him my email.

22:33.418 --> 22:34.820
I run home, and I log in,
and there's a--

22:35.554 --> 22:36.021
And I say, meet me

22:37.222 --> 22:37.889
in the communal laundry room downstairs.

22:39.291 --> 22:40.425
And he's already in there
with his chonies down

22:41.760 --> 22:44.629
on top of the washer machine
on the final cycle.

22:45.831 --> 22:47.933
That's when I realized
he wants my South Pole.

22:51.336 --> 22:53.438
So the idea is, like, I thought
I was going to bottom,

22:54.339 --> 22:54.806
but he wants to be the bottom.

22:56.007 --> 22:56.375
It's taking too long
to get to the punchline.

22:56.842 --> 22:57.576
Okay.

22:58.777 --> 22:59.144
So I crawled into bed
next to my boyfriend,

23:00.412 --> 23:02.247
and I whispered, "Ho, ho, ho.
Merry Christmas."

23:03.682 --> 23:05.550
As if I'm going to give it
to him, because he left me.

23:06.985 --> 23:08.086
I'm a little nervous, because
I can ramble and I can talk,

23:09.521 --> 23:10.622
and I'm trying to remember,
like, girl, you got this.

23:11.623 --> 23:12.324
Like, calm down, bitch.
You're fine.

23:13.058 --> 23:13.525
Because I'm over that

23:14.659 --> 23:15.727
being-in-the-bottom
bullshit, okay?

23:16.895 --> 23:18.663
I think there's so much fat
you can cut.

23:19.998 --> 23:20.665
Just take, like, what are
the funniest parts

23:21.800 --> 23:22.367
and you want to
get to them sooner.

23:22.467 --> 23:23.201
Got ya.

23:24.603 --> 23:24.803
You know what you're doing
because these are your stories.

23:25.837 --> 23:26.304
You're just
embellishing on them.

23:27.706 --> 23:29.441
So what you need to do tonight
is work on those timings.

23:30.909 --> 23:32.077
I will stay up all night to
make sure that I'm in the top.

23:33.211 --> 23:35.280
But if Salina flops,
I am going to jump ship.

23:35.881 --> 23:36.548
Sorry, girl.

23:37.416 --> 23:38.250
I hope you have your floatie.

23:39.351 --> 23:40.685
I am going to make sure
that I am swimming

23:41.686 --> 23:42.854
- out to the shore, honey.
- Good luck.

23:43.855 --> 23:44.856
both:
Thank you so much.

23:45.690 --> 23:46.625
- Oh.
- Hi, kids.

23:47.092 --> 23:48.727
Hi.

23:49.327 --> 23:50.061
I am so excited.

23:51.263 --> 23:51.763
I was like, when is an
Asian queen coming out?

23:52.531 --> 23:53.799
We had two, but...

23:54.433 --> 23:55.167
[laughter]

23:56.134 --> 23:56.501
Luckily,
I feel much better now.

23:57.903 --> 23:59.137
I got some, like, meds and
pills in, so I'm good.

24:00.372 --> 24:01.273
I mean, this is
"RuPaul's fucking Drag Race,"

24:02.274 --> 24:03.675
and I'm not laying down
for nothing.

24:05.043 --> 24:07.045
So, Anetra, I heard
about your ocular migraines.

24:08.447 --> 24:09.014
I can tell you that they're
nothing to worry about.

24:09.948 --> 24:11.283
- Okay.
- So familiar with them.

24:12.451 --> 24:13.018
Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman
over here.

24:13.885 --> 24:14.619
- Thank you.
- I had no idea.

24:15.854 --> 24:17.088
There's nothing I can't do.
Let's get going.

24:18.123 --> 24:18.590
- Okay, great.
- Hear what you've got.

24:20.058 --> 24:22.327
I'm going to start it off
by thanking Luxx and Loosey.

24:23.462 --> 24:23.595
Do you know
what the direction

24:24.463 --> 24:25.163
you're going to go in is?

24:26.598 --> 24:27.699
Like, I was thinking, like,
drag's answer to Penn & Teller,

24:29.134 --> 24:29.601
which, you know, you want one
of them mute and the other one,

24:30.335 --> 24:30.836
I don't know, something.

24:32.070 --> 24:32.637
That's good.
You're onto something there.

24:33.839 --> 24:35.640
And then it was going
to go into Anetra's bit.

24:36.842 --> 24:37.175
When I sat down
to write, the pain

24:38.510 --> 24:39.044
was so excruciating
that all I could think about

24:39.845 --> 24:40.245
- was my headache.
- Okay.

24:41.346 --> 24:41.713
So I kind of just
ran with that.

24:42.180 --> 24:42.848
Okay.

24:44.115 --> 24:45.050
I'm dealing
with a migraine currently

24:46.184 --> 24:47.352
bigger than Mistress and
Luxx's ego combined.

24:48.253 --> 24:48.920
- Yes.
- It's an inside joke.

24:49.921 --> 24:50.789
Are we going to get it?
both: Right.

24:52.190 --> 24:52.958
You never want to do an
inside joke that we won't get.

24:53.425 --> 24:54.159
Okay.

24:55.327 --> 24:56.094
My head is throbbing
harder than Salina

24:56.828 --> 24:57.395
during Pride season.

25:00.365 --> 25:04.703
- Does Salina--she--
- EsTitties.

25:05.504 --> 25:06.004
- Scrapping it.
- Okay.

25:07.873 --> 25:10.408
[softly] Oh, my God.

25:11.576 --> 25:12.277
And then I have--
but lucky for my man,

25:13.144 --> 25:14.913
my head is an absolute mess.

25:16.114 --> 25:17.449
Why is your man lucky
if you can't give head?

25:17.916 --> 25:19.451
Yeah.

25:20.318 --> 25:21.219
Girl, it's not going well.

25:22.387 --> 25:22.854
Trying to figure out
the headache jokes

25:23.722 --> 25:24.189
is making my headache worse.

25:25.056 --> 25:25.957
Should I scrap the headache?

25:26.892 --> 25:28.126
- Maybe.
- When are you funniest?

25:29.261 --> 25:29.594
When do you make people laugh
the most?

25:30.195 --> 25:31.263
I don't know.

25:32.430 --> 25:33.131
There are jokes
in you, Anetra.

25:34.232 --> 25:35.133
Sasha can help you.
You're a team.

25:36.134 --> 25:36.935
You go down,
she probably goes down.

25:38.236 --> 25:39.271
So it's important
to look out for one another

25:40.005 --> 25:40.872
in this situation.

25:41.907 --> 25:43.275
So keep at it
and see the bubbly side

25:44.209 --> 25:45.243
and turn it out
for us tomorrow.

25:46.678 --> 25:48.246
I just want to pray that the
physical is overwhelming her

25:48.980 --> 25:49.514
and she'll click in,

25:50.649 --> 25:52.050
because I don't want us
to be on the bottom.

25:53.184 --> 25:53.718
[whispering] I'm
worried about Anetra.

25:54.452 --> 25:55.287
[whispering] Me too.

25:55.887 --> 25:58.056
[upbeat music]

25:58.523 --> 25:59.724
Wow.

26:00.191 --> 26:00.926
Ahh...

26:02.127 --> 26:03.828
It is elimination
day, and tonight we

26:05.263 --> 26:06.965
are performing our comedy
sets in front of the judges

26:07.699 --> 26:09.601
and a live audience.

26:10.335 --> 26:12.437
[music continues]

26:13.471 --> 26:15.507
- So how are we feeling?
- I feel good.

26:16.841 --> 26:17.309
I definitely kind
of feel like I got, like,

26:18.176 --> 26:20.111
a little bit of a rough start.

26:20.845 --> 26:22.047
I'm feeling good today.

26:23.281 --> 26:24.049
It's pretty clear
that none of the headache jokes

26:25.250 --> 26:26.251
were landing, so after
the coaching session,

26:27.252 --> 26:27.986
I did take
a different direction,

26:29.087 --> 26:30.188
and I feel much better
about it today.

26:31.623 --> 26:34.326
I'm excited to see that we
are applying the critique.

26:35.226 --> 26:35.860
- Mm-hmm.
- Hoo...

26:36.728 --> 26:38.697
After a pretty rough start,

26:39.831 --> 26:40.265
I know that my shit
has to be tight.

26:41.433 --> 26:42.701
And I'm just praying
that Anetra's head is

26:43.435 --> 26:44.369
in the game literally.

26:45.103 --> 26:46.371
[music continues]

26:47.639 --> 26:48.506
So how are you guys feeling
after everything?

26:49.107 --> 26:49.608
Really good.

26:50.709 --> 26:51.109
Yeah, I'm feeling
super excited.

26:51.843 --> 26:52.410
Yeah, very confident.

26:53.578 --> 26:54.479
So how are you and your
partner doing, Marcia?

26:55.647 --> 26:57.015
Me and Marcia are
doing really well.

26:58.083 --> 26:58.984
How are you
feeling working solo?

27:00.118 --> 27:00.952
You know, part of it's
just a little scary

27:02.287 --> 27:05.023
because I didn't have
anybody to, like, work off of

27:06.424 --> 27:07.659
and I had to kind of come up
with everything myself.

27:08.960 --> 27:09.894
Was that something
that, like, made you nervous?

27:11.363 --> 27:13.098
I really tried to think of it
like, okay, this is a blessing.

27:14.532 --> 27:16.768
This is an opportunity for me
to kind of shine on my own.

27:17.636 --> 27:18.603
This is the first morning

27:19.871 --> 27:22.107
I've woken up
with butterflies in there,

27:23.508 --> 27:25.810
just because if I mess up,
it's, like, all on me.

27:27.245 --> 27:29.481
I will admit, being alone
in a challenge like this,

27:30.582 --> 27:31.583
don't let it, like,
throw you off.

27:32.183 --> 27:32.717
Girl...

27:33.785 --> 27:34.319
I feel like
if you get thrown off,

27:35.420 --> 27:36.187
it's going to be, like,
even worse for you

27:37.589 --> 27:39.491
because you don't have someone
else to pick up the slack.

27:40.492 --> 27:41.326
- It's like...
- Oh, that's true, too.

27:41.926 --> 27:43.928
It's only you.

27:45.063 --> 27:45.263
Look at them
psyching her out.

27:46.431 --> 27:46.564
You think that's
what happening?

27:47.399 --> 27:48.733
Yes, ma'am.
[laughs]

27:49.467 --> 27:50.035
Them hos is shady.

27:51.369 --> 27:54.072
If that's what you
treat your friends like...

27:55.273 --> 27:57.409
I don't want to know
about your enemies.

27:58.576 --> 27:58.810
Would you say that
you get your humor

27:59.678 --> 28:00.345
because of growing up chubby?

28:01.379 --> 28:02.280
I know for me I grew up
really chubby,

28:03.348 --> 28:03.848
and it's because
I'm not the pretty one,

28:05.283 --> 28:06.785
you got to entertain the kids
with a little, you know, humor.

28:07.986 --> 28:08.653
I've never really
let that affect me.

28:09.854 --> 28:11.623
I always just say
what's on my mind.

28:12.490 --> 28:13.258
You've been doing that, girl.

28:14.359 --> 28:14.793
I think also
it's different, too,

28:16.227 --> 28:16.995
when you're born and raised
with a whole bunch of Latinas,

28:18.096 --> 28:19.297
- because, you know...
- They cut up.

28:20.031 --> 28:21.032
Me and Mistress vibe.

28:22.233 --> 28:23.068
We're both thick.
We're both Latina.

28:24.369 --> 28:24.936
We have similar upbringings
and perspectives.

28:25.804 --> 28:26.471
So I really relate to that.

28:27.572 --> 28:27.972
You know, also, too,
with Latinas,

28:29.374 --> 28:30.275
it's like, they also keep
a lot of stuff hidden.

28:31.710 --> 28:33.411
That's, like, a big reason
I think why me and my family,

28:34.446 --> 28:34.746
like, just didn't see
eye to eye.

28:36.114 --> 28:36.915
My mom--me coming out gay,
being a drag queen,

28:38.349 --> 28:39.150
her biggest thing was like,
what are people gonna think--

28:40.285 --> 28:40.418
- You're ruining the dream.
- Yeah.

28:41.019 --> 28:41.986
That's hard.

28:43.221 --> 28:44.656
Was there, like,
something that prompted, like,

28:45.523 --> 28:46.357
you know, like, the cutoff?

28:47.525 --> 28:49.360
So. from 17 and up,
I was already on my own.

28:50.795 --> 28:51.563
But I would always try to
give my mom little ways

28:52.430 --> 28:53.098
to come back into my life.

28:53.965 --> 28:55.033
I had broke my ankle one time

28:56.167 --> 28:56.935
when I was performing
at a brunch show.

28:58.103 --> 28:58.503
- You were bucking too hard?
- In drag.

28:59.604 --> 29:01.473
My ankle, like, snapped,
like, full broke.

29:02.640 --> 29:03.608
And I go to get up,
and it's like a movie.

29:04.476 --> 29:05.677
Like, my leg is like spaghetti.

29:06.845 --> 29:07.412
Call my mom when I'm
in the emergency room.

29:08.546 --> 29:09.080
I'm like, hey,
I broke my ankle.

29:10.548 --> 29:12.584
I need you to come, like, help
get my medical things situated

29:13.451 --> 29:14.152
and, like, go get my stuff.

29:15.019 --> 29:15.487
So she shows up and she goes,

29:16.654 --> 29:17.455
ugh, what the fuck
are you wearing?

29:18.323 --> 29:18.790
Because I'm still in drag.

29:19.991 --> 29:21.226
So keep in mind I'm
in so much pain now.

29:22.560 --> 29:23.361
So I literally told her, girl,
please leave me alone

29:24.529 --> 29:25.530
and forget I even ever
reached out to you.

29:26.397 --> 29:27.031
And, like, after that day,

29:28.299 --> 29:29.701
I have not talked to my mom
in, like, years.

29:30.435 --> 29:31.636
I wouldn't either.

29:33.004 --> 29:34.439
I think when I was
younger and as I grew up,

29:35.874 --> 29:37.242
I kind of always pictured
that when I became an adult

29:38.109 --> 29:38.343
that we would work it out.

29:39.511 --> 29:40.278
But I think that
some of the things

29:41.446 --> 29:42.847
my mom has said and done
are just unforgivable.

29:43.948 --> 29:45.049
So I don't think
that I would ever have

29:45.784 --> 29:46.584
a relationship with her.

29:48.052 --> 29:49.053
And I think, like, after that
day, it just helped me realize

29:50.355 --> 29:52.590
that I can't keep putting
myself out there

29:53.858 --> 29:55.026
to expect something
from someone who doesn't see me

29:55.760 --> 29:56.761
as a normal human being.

29:57.929 --> 29:59.364
But it was just such
a learning experience,

30:00.765 --> 30:01.800
and, like, weirdly enough,
one of, like, the best things

30:02.534 --> 30:03.334
to ever happen to me.

30:04.502 --> 30:05.236
Breaking my ankle
really showed me

30:06.304 --> 30:07.172
so much about
who I could depend on,

30:08.039 --> 30:08.773
who really matters in my life.

30:09.641 --> 30:10.608
And now I have a bionic ankle.

30:11.776 --> 30:12.510
Nothing is going to
break or shatter her.

30:13.645 --> 30:14.879
I feel unstoppable
at this point.

30:19.751 --> 30:24.756

Yes.

30:41.906 --> 30:43.274
And what?

30:44.709 --> 30:46.444
Welcome to the main stage
of "RuPaul's Drag Race."

30:47.779 --> 30:49.814
My favorite straight man,
Michelle Visage.

30:50.982 --> 30:51.449
Well, you know
what they say, Ru--

30:52.217 --> 30:53.351
you are what you eat.

30:53.985 --> 30:56.788
[laughter]

30:57.655 --> 30:59.457
The electric Ts Madison.

31:00.458 --> 31:01.159
Hey, Ru,
I got a joke for you.

31:02.427 --> 31:03.261
- What does a nosy pepper do?
- I don't know.

31:04.128 --> 31:05.029
What does a nosy pepper do?

31:05.897 --> 31:06.865
It gets jalapeño business.

31:07.465 --> 31:09.634
[laughter]

31:10.501 --> 31:12.670
And the hilarious Ali Wong.

31:13.404 --> 31:14.072
You look gorgeous.

31:15.206 --> 31:16.975
I can't believe
you've had two kids.

31:18.142 --> 31:19.177
Well, Ru, I have to
take care of myself.

31:19.777 --> 31:20.445
I'm single now,

31:21.679 --> 31:22.247
and this pussy ain't gonna
eat itself.

31:22.847 --> 31:24.616
[laughter]

31:25.683 --> 31:26.284
This week we
challenged our queens

31:27.652 --> 31:30.121
to make us crack a smile
at the Bubly Comedy Festival.

31:30.989 --> 31:32.357
And tonight on the runway,

31:33.324 --> 31:35.994
category
is Rip Her To Shreds.

31:37.395 --> 31:40.331
Racers, start your engines, and
may the best drag queen win.

From the main stage
of "RuPaul's Drag Race,"

31:47.438 --> 31:49.340
it's the Bubly Comedy Festival.

31:50.241 --> 31:52.443
Please give a warm welcome

31:53.211 --> 31:54.646
to Marcia Marcia Marcia.

31:55.413 --> 31:57.148
[cheers and applause]

31:57.749 --> 31:58.783
Oh, my gosh.

31:59.517 --> 32:01.219
Look at these faces.

32:02.220 --> 32:03.221
My name is
Marcia Marcia Marcia.

32:04.088 --> 32:05.390
I'm sort of a newer drag queen.

32:06.791 --> 32:08.960
So being here has felt
a lot like puberty to me.

32:09.827 --> 32:12.797
You know, my body is changing.

32:13.998 --> 32:14.666
I'm, like, discovering
a lot of insecurities

32:15.533 --> 32:15.900
that I didn't know that I had.

32:16.501 --> 32:17.335
But guess what.

32:18.069 --> 32:20.004
I'm finally a B cup. Ah!

32:21.839 --> 32:24.876
But, yes, another journey
that I've really been going on

32:26.044 --> 32:26.544
since I've been here
is with my makeup.

32:27.912 --> 32:29.614
When I got here, we'll say
I wasn't necessarily

32:30.348 --> 32:31.916
doing "drag," per se.

32:33.051 --> 32:35.553
I was more enhancing
my natural beauty, yeah.

32:36.988 --> 32:38.089
And everybody at home kept
telling me how pretty I was,

32:38.823 --> 32:39.757
which begs the question,

32:41.125 --> 32:41.659
where were you when you
realized your entire hometown

32:42.393 --> 32:43.394
was lying to you?

32:44.562 --> 32:46.197
Yeah, I was on television.
[laughs]

32:46.831 --> 32:48.132
Yeah, yeah.

[cheers and applause]

32:58.676 --> 33:00.011
You may notice
that Ross and Carson

33:00.878 --> 33:01.212
are not up there tonight.

33:02.246 --> 33:02.613
Unfortunately,
they could not be here.

33:03.848 --> 33:05.316
They are filming "Die Hard 20"
down the street.

33:06.417 --> 33:07.118
Yeah, not exactly
what I meant

33:08.353 --> 33:08.853
when I wanted more diversity
in Hollywood,

33:09.721 --> 33:10.755
but you take what you can get.

33:11.489 --> 33:11.956
On the judges' panel,

33:13.091 --> 33:14.759
we have Ursula the Sea Witch, everybody.

33:15.626 --> 33:17.595
Give it up for Ts Madison.

33:19.030 --> 33:21.132
Your critiques have got some
of these girls really nervous.

33:21.599 --> 33:22.433
Oh.

33:23.668 --> 33:24.535
And when I say "these girls,"
I do mean myself.

33:25.403 --> 33:27.038
I am very nervous around you.

33:28.072 --> 33:29.340
And with that,
I think that's my time.

33:30.408 --> 33:31.275
Y'all have been
an incredible audience--

33:31.876 --> 33:32.443
so welcoming.

33:33.544 --> 33:34.645
And it is part of my job
as the show opener

33:35.646 --> 33:37.315
to introduce
our next pair of girls.

33:38.449 --> 33:39.951
These two are some
of my closest friends

33:40.685 --> 33:41.252
in the competition.

33:42.453 --> 33:43.454
So I can tell you from
a really sincere place

33:44.589 --> 33:47.025
that they're both
rotted garbage people.

33:47.492 --> 33:48.092
Yeah.

33:49.260 --> 33:50.895
Luxx Noir London
and Loosey LaDuca.

33:51.629 --> 33:52.363
Thank you all so much.

[cheers and applause]

33:55.600 --> 33:56.868
Oh, hello.

33:58.269 --> 34:00.004
Now, first of all, give it up
for Marcia Marcia Marcia.

34:01.272 --> 34:03.341
Yes, oh, my God.
Wasn't that such a funny joke?

34:04.709 --> 34:07.011
Her comedy wasn't half bad
either, am I right?

34:08.446 --> 34:10.081
You know, Loosey, I'm sure
nobody's ever told you this,

34:10.948 --> 34:12.283
but you have really nice teeth.

34:12.884 --> 34:13.384
Thank you.

34:14.519 --> 34:15.353
How do you keep
them so white?

34:16.254 --> 34:17.155
- I whiten them.
- Oh, my God.

34:18.289 --> 34:19.524
I didn't think you
could get any whiter.

34:20.591 --> 34:21.359
Oh, wow.
Okay, here's how.

34:22.093 --> 34:22.693
This is what you do.

34:23.628 --> 34:24.295
You take
the white strips, okay?

34:25.730 --> 34:27.198
Now, those pesky directions
will tell you 30 minutes.

34:28.099 --> 34:29.033
Forget it.
Put them on.

34:29.767 --> 34:30.401
Baby, you go to bed.

34:31.135 --> 34:32.036
[gasps] - Oh, yeah.

34:33.237 --> 34:34.205
Yeah, eight hours later,
you're going to wake up,

34:35.406 --> 34:36.507
and your teeth are
going to be white.

34:37.942 --> 34:39.977
They'll be on your pillow,
but they will be white.

34:40.711 --> 34:41.846
How white do they get?

34:42.713 --> 34:43.881
Oh, girl, they get so white,

34:44.982 --> 34:47.385
they put mayonnaise
on everything.

34:48.586 --> 34:49.420
Oh, honey, I bet they
get so white, they say,

34:50.421 --> 34:52.323
can I speak
to the manager, please?

34:53.791 --> 34:55.993
Girl, they get so white,
they find my comedy funny.

34:56.727 --> 34:58.229
I know that's white.

35:01.933 --> 35:04.168
It's good.
I can say when it's good.

35:04.769 --> 35:06.137
[laughter]

35:07.238 --> 35:07.738
I don't like saying it,
but I can say it.

35:09.040 --> 35:09.874
Now, Luxxy, I don't mean
to embarrass you

35:11.042 --> 35:12.176
in front of all
of your fan, but--

35:14.178 --> 35:18.583
I heard a nasty rumor that
you might have a sugar daddy.

35:19.383 --> 35:21.085
A sugar daddy?
[gasps]

35:21.686 --> 35:23.488
Actually, I do.

35:24.722 --> 35:26.390
He's so sweet,
and I hear he has a friend.

35:26.991 --> 35:27.825
Wink, wink.

35:29.293 --> 35:30.528
Oh, sweetheart, listen,
if I wanted a sugar daddy,

35:31.729 --> 35:32.563
I could probably get his
number from you, right?

35:33.931 --> 35:35.233
Oh, yeah, girl, no, of
course, of course, of course.

35:36.601 --> 35:37.568
All right, listen, we
got to get out of here, okay?

35:38.436 --> 35:40.605
I am late for my lobotomy.

35:42.073 --> 35:44.876
Our next duo consists of
a legend, an icon, a star,

35:46.210 --> 35:47.812
a former Miss Continental,
and a trailblazer

35:48.546 --> 35:49.480
in our community.

35:50.348 --> 35:52.550
And the other one is Anetra.

35:53.284 --> 35:55.987
[cheers and applause]

35:56.854 --> 35:58.856
We are the two stoned queens.

35:59.857 --> 36:00.358
- You know what I mean?
- Mm-hmm.

36:01.425 --> 36:01.993
We're living
the California dream.

36:03.194 --> 36:04.128
We're living
the California sober dream,

36:04.862 --> 36:05.663
you know what I mean?

36:06.264 --> 36:06.898
Yeah. Yeah.

36:08.099 --> 36:10.001
I'm feeling
like Demi Lovato up in here.

36:11.169 --> 36:11.903
- Love it. Love it.
- My name is Anetra.

36:12.770 --> 36:14.071
I'm from Sin City, Las Vegas.

36:14.805 --> 36:16.140
[cheers and applause]

36:17.475 --> 36:18.543
So that means that I have
a venereal disease

36:19.677 --> 36:22.280
and I can show
you a great time.

36:23.147 --> 36:26.317
And now some canned bits.

36:27.185 --> 36:29.720
You know, sex is a misdemeanor.

36:30.621 --> 36:31.989
- Oh, really?
- Oh, yeah.

36:33.157 --> 36:34.091
The more you miss,
the meaner you get.

36:34.692 --> 36:36.160
both: Oh.

36:37.028 --> 36:37.461
You know what else they say?

36:38.629 --> 36:39.864
They say sex is a lot
like playing bridge.

36:40.598 --> 36:41.299
What do you mean?

36:42.500 --> 36:42.767
Well, if you don't
have a good partner,

36:43.634 --> 36:44.402
you better have a good hand.

36:44.869 --> 36:46.737
Ow!

36:48.105 --> 36:49.140
You know what I love
more than canned bits is--

36:50.274 --> 36:50.841
- You know what I love?
- I think I know.

36:51.976 --> 36:52.109
- I think you know.
- I think I do.

36:52.977 --> 36:54.512
Yeah, I think you know.

36:55.413 --> 36:58.249
We love some...
both: Laganja.

36:59.317 --> 37:02.253
Oh, yes, mama, let's
get sickening,

37:02.853 --> 37:05.122
okurrrrr?

37:08.259 --> 37:10.394
They're not getting
a lot of laughs.

37:11.262 --> 37:12.830
There's some dead air in there.

37:14.265 --> 37:15.333
Stoned queens--we just get
such a bad rap, you know?

37:16.601 --> 37:19.503
Yeah, it's like we're lazy,
we're forgettable,

37:20.605 --> 37:21.906
- we get the munchies.
- Yeah. Yeah.

37:22.940 --> 37:24.542
- We're forgetful.
- Wait.

37:25.509 --> 37:26.577
We're--
You already did that.

37:28.045 --> 37:29.480
Oh, right, right, right.
[clears throat] Anyway...

37:30.648 --> 37:30.915
Wait. What were we
talking about, again?

37:31.515 --> 37:32.350
Well...

37:32.950 --> 37:35.152
[dramatic music]

37:36.587 --> 37:37.488
I'm feeling a little bad
for them at this point.

37:38.889 --> 37:41.225
God, this bit is lasting
longer than Yvie Oddly's dick.

37:41.959 --> 37:43.160
Yeah, I went there.

37:44.462 --> 37:45.096
It's like a bell.
Can't unring it, all right?

37:45.830 --> 37:46.497
Let's just go for it.

37:47.098 --> 37:47.965
All right.

37:49.100 --> 37:49.433
What we really
want to talk about

37:50.301 --> 37:52.837
is Michelle's huge balls.

37:53.304 --> 37:54.038
Ew.

37:55.206 --> 37:56.007
Michelle Visage's
balls are so big,

37:57.375 --> 38:00.711
she lovingly refers to
them as Latrice and Eureka.

38:03.080 --> 38:05.583
But unlike Latrice and Eureka,

38:06.450 --> 38:08.619
Michelle's balls have lasted

38:09.553 --> 38:11.789
an entire season
of "Drag Race."

38:12.923 --> 38:13.958
- Damn.
- Our time for you is over.

38:15.159 --> 38:16.627
Welcome to the stage
our next two divas,

38:18.095 --> 38:20.931
Salina EsTitties and STD's
Mistress Isabelle Brooks.

38:21.899 --> 38:23.801
- Thank you, good night.
- Whoo!

38:25.136 --> 38:26.170
- [cheers and applause]
- Thank you, Sasha and Anetra.

38:27.605 --> 38:29.807
Who knew getting high can
bring such a new low, girl?

38:30.675 --> 38:32.643
These people are so beautiful.

38:33.711 --> 38:35.246
Look at all the sexy men
in the audience.

38:35.980 --> 38:36.347
Ooh, you're right.

38:37.515 --> 38:39.417
Ru does look good
tonight, doesn't he?

38:40.551 --> 38:41.852
Mistress, as a
juicy, thick Latina,

38:42.787 --> 38:43.254
it's hard to get
a man sometimes.

38:44.121 --> 38:44.755
They can't handle all this.

38:45.956 --> 38:46.524
One time I was at
a Christmas party,

38:47.692 --> 38:48.859
and I was dressed as
a pregnant Mrs. Claus.

38:49.727 --> 38:50.895
- As a who?
- Yeah.

38:52.330 --> 38:54.398
I had this prosthetic belly.
It was out to, like, here.

38:54.999 --> 38:55.900
Oh, bitch.

38:57.301 --> 38:57.802
And there was this fine
piece of trade across the way.

38:59.003 --> 39:02.273
He was hairy and veiny,
and he was, like, 6'5".

39:03.541 --> 39:05.276
He came over to me, right?
He said, 'sup.

39:06.444 --> 39:08.713
I want to feel that
baby from the inside.

39:09.313 --> 39:10.147
[screams]

39:11.315 --> 39:12.550
Girl, so I sent him
my address, right?

39:13.584 --> 39:14.819
I run home,
I throw my shoes off,

39:16.253 --> 39:17.722
- I take my hip pads off, right?
- You keep the belly on, bitch?

39:18.856 --> 39:21.125
Duh, you can't
get pregnant twice.

39:21.726 --> 39:22.727
So I text trade.

39:24.161 --> 39:25.096
I said, meet me in the communal
laundry room downstairs, okay?

39:26.464 --> 39:28.866
I put on my chanclas,
I run over, I open the door.

39:30.334 --> 39:32.837
[gasps] Trade is bent over the
dryer on its final spin cycle.

39:33.437 --> 39:34.438
No, ma'am!

39:35.573 --> 39:37.141
His figgy pudding
just shaking in midair.

39:38.008 --> 39:38.943
Remember, he was 6'5", girl.

39:39.677 --> 39:40.611
I'm trying to get in.

39:41.879 --> 39:42.646
- Reach, reach, girl, reach.
- I can't reach.

39:44.014 --> 39:46.684
So I whisper in his ear, right?
I'll be right back, papi.

39:47.284 --> 39:48.285
I run upstairs,

39:49.653 --> 39:51.122
I grab my highest pair
of platform stiletto heels,

39:52.156 --> 39:52.957
put them on,
I kick open the door.

39:53.991 --> 39:55.926
[imitates door opening]
He's vanished.

39:57.094 --> 39:58.295
It was just me and
my unborn child

39:59.463 --> 40:01.565
and a hot, steamy
load of laundry.

40:02.967 --> 40:04.769
Girl, that's why I don't
even entertain trade in drag.

40:06.237 --> 40:08.005
I was craving a little Mexican,
so I hopped on the hook-up apps

40:08.606 --> 40:09.006
to go shopping--

40:09.874 --> 40:10.875
you know, the yellow Facebook.

40:11.976 --> 40:14.578
And I found this
sickening papi, girl.

40:15.479 --> 40:19.383
He was hairy,
veiny, and 6'5".

40:20.117 --> 40:20.818
He sounds perfect.

40:21.419 --> 40:21.886
Girl, he was.

40:23.053 --> 40:23.454
So I start doing
my normal routine

40:24.321 --> 40:24.822
before a trade comes over.

40:26.023 --> 40:29.593
I dim the lights, I put
on some seductive music.

40:30.761 --> 40:32.062
I like something
sexy and sensual.

40:33.397 --> 40:34.298
I just knew papi was going
to make me go...

40:35.065 --> 40:36.867
[screaming wildly]

40:38.068 --> 40:40.471
Ooh, I was ready
to get me a piece.

40:41.372 --> 40:42.106
Okay, girl, get to the point.

40:43.207 --> 40:44.508
There's a lot
of unnecessary detail

40:45.276 --> 40:46.110
that isn't really funny.

40:47.311 --> 40:47.912
I heard a knock at
my door, so I run.

40:48.946 --> 40:50.381
And as soon as I open
the door,

40:51.549 --> 40:52.883
he looked even better
than his picture.

40:53.784 --> 40:54.685
So I took him to the bedroom.

40:55.820 --> 40:56.720
And, baby, you know
I got to work.

40:58.122 --> 40:59.657
And then all of a sudden,
he goes, "Aah! What is that?"

41:00.524 --> 41:01.725
Girl, I flip on the switch.

41:03.127 --> 41:05.296
Tell me why there's a big-ass
rhinestone on this man's--

41:05.763 --> 41:06.564
Pinga?

41:07.431 --> 41:08.098
Bitch, you already know.

41:09.533 --> 41:11.068
So I take that stone from
his disco stick so fast.

41:11.936 --> 41:12.436
Wait, so what happened?

41:13.838 --> 41:13.971
Girl, before I could even
get back to the session,

41:14.572 --> 41:15.206
he was gone.

41:15.673 --> 41:16.273
What?

41:17.141 --> 41:17.575
What about the rhinestone?

41:18.442 --> 41:19.610
Oh, girl, it's right here.

41:20.511 --> 41:21.378
What is that?
Ooh, hold on.

41:24.715 --> 41:27.485
both:
Ignacio.

41:28.586 --> 41:29.954
Good night, you guys.
Thank you so much.

41:30.821 --> 41:31.455
You've been a lovely audience.

41:32.189 --> 41:34.492
[cheers and applause]

41:37.261 --> 41:40.731
[singing] The world
is your runway

41:41.866 --> 41:44.134
Category is
Rip Her To Shreds.

41:45.035 --> 41:49.173
Up first, Marcia Marcia Marcia.

41:50.374 --> 41:53.777
What, did Jan
win or something?

41:54.979 --> 41:56.680
Honey, I am limping
down this runway, girl.

41:57.715 --> 41:58.849
I'm a pageant queen,
and I won,

42:00.284 --> 42:01.185
and all the girls didn't
think that I deserved it.

42:02.052 --> 42:03.721
So they tore apart my dress.

42:04.588 --> 42:05.356
And, of course, I'm crying,

42:06.423 --> 42:07.491
'cause this is supposed
to be my moment.

42:08.526 --> 42:09.960
If I can be beautiful
and in pain

42:11.262 --> 42:13.097
and funny at the same time,
that's drag, mama.

42:14.465 --> 42:17.067
You know, these pageants
can be so cutthroat.

42:17.668 --> 42:18.869
Loosey LaDuca...

42:20.004 --> 42:21.972
Viola Swamp really
got a makeover.

42:23.274 --> 42:25.309
I'm giving you
Nosferatu realness, girl.

42:26.544 --> 42:28.212
I am serving
a Victorian vampire queen.

42:29.613 --> 42:30.848
She's been alive hundreds
and hundreds of years,

42:32.283 --> 42:34.919
and all of her clothing has
been dragging through the mud,

42:36.287 --> 42:38.789
and everything is just torn
and spooky-ooky-kooky.

42:39.390 --> 42:40.457
I look dead.

42:41.325 --> 42:42.259
Interview with a glampire.

42:43.661 --> 42:45.162
I got to tell you, the
dry cleaners in Transylvania

42:45.796 --> 42:47.932
are the worst.

42:48.699 --> 42:50.034
Luxx Noir London...

42:50.935 --> 42:52.269
I can see her wee-wee pole.

42:52.770 --> 42:53.571
Yes.

42:54.705 --> 42:56.540
This look was inspired
by RuPaul herself.

42:57.675 --> 42:58.876
She wore this
look in the 1980s.

43:00.277 --> 43:02.446
She was in a punk rock
band called Wee Wee Pole.

43:03.847 --> 43:06.450
It's just like this shiny
kind of Liberace, Mad Max type

43:06.917 --> 43:07.551
of feel.

43:08.419 --> 43:09.853
This hair is the largest hair

43:10.988 --> 43:12.456
that I have ever worn
in my entire life.

43:13.190 --> 43:13.657
Like, it's just giving.

43:14.725 --> 43:16.193
This is true supermodel
vibes right now.

43:17.361 --> 43:18.028
This look is
giving me déjà Ru.

43:18.662 --> 43:20.331
Yes.
[laughs]

43:20.931 --> 43:21.966
Sasha Colby...

43:22.700 --> 43:23.767
She's got great jeans.

43:24.635 --> 43:26.937
From the House of Rip Torn.

43:28.105 --> 43:29.807
Nothing gets between
me and my Calvins...

43:30.541 --> 43:31.542
except all that ass.

43:33.210 --> 43:38.015
This gown is a denim dream
shredded to bits.

43:38.949 --> 43:41.118
It's giving you
early-2000s VMA.

43:42.219 --> 43:42.987
I feel like a "TRL"
moment, honey.

43:44.088 --> 43:45.956
I feel like that
"Total Request Live."

43:46.690 --> 43:49.693
I shred what I shred.

43:50.294 --> 43:51.662
Anetra...

43:53.130 --> 43:55.299
If you stay shreddy, you
ain't got to get shreddy.

43:56.467 --> 43:57.568
I am giving you
this shredded catsuit.

43:58.969 --> 44:00.337
My concept is a lotus
shredding through the mud

44:01.705 --> 44:02.673
and coming out to blossom
on top of the lake.

44:03.641 --> 44:04.942
I'm giving you hot pink underneath

44:05.676 --> 44:06.310
to represent the lotus,

44:07.478 --> 44:08.145
and I'm giving you green
to represent the water

44:08.879 --> 44:09.513
and the murkiness of it.

44:10.681 --> 44:11.882
Lotus flowers can only
blossom when they're

44:12.750 --> 44:13.984
in muddy or dirty waters.

44:15.352 --> 44:15.753
You kind of have to, like,
go through something

44:16.620 --> 44:17.488
to come out on top and shine.

44:18.355 --> 44:19.323
Ripped for her pleasure.

44:21.425 --> 44:23.293
Salina EsTitties...

44:24.461 --> 44:27.064
This week my runway
is the story of a woman

44:27.931 --> 44:29.299
escaping for a better life.

44:30.334 --> 44:32.369
My mom told me
how she got to America.

44:33.570 --> 44:35.205
She was 17, running,
crossing the border.

44:36.073 --> 44:36.540
No one knows how hard it is

44:37.741 --> 44:38.876
and what that takes,
trying to get here.

44:39.943 --> 44:40.844
Baby, I got
my big Latina hair,

44:41.912 --> 44:43.280
I got my cobija
that's shredded, honey.

44:44.481 --> 44:45.816
My runway is dedicated
to every Latina mother

44:46.984 --> 44:48.752
who wanted more
for their family.

44:49.620 --> 44:52.156
Mistress Isabelle Brooks...

44:53.290 --> 44:55.626
She is booked,
burnt, and blessed.

44:56.560 --> 44:57.828
I didn't burn,
I crystallized.

44:58.896 --> 45:00.097
It's Madonna's
"Material Girl" meets

45:01.565 --> 45:04.034
Mugler meets Moschino with
just a hint of Texas drag.

45:04.768 --> 45:05.202
I look so fierce.

45:05.936 --> 45:06.804
I feel so fashionable.

45:07.938 --> 45:08.505
And the judges
are eating it up.

45:09.707 --> 45:11.842
Y'all see the shape, honey.
Boop, boop.

45:12.443 --> 45:13.077
Sickening.

45:14.178 --> 45:16.413
Honey, her pussy is on broil.
[laughter]

45:17.815 --> 45:19.316
She's got one in the pink
and two in her butthole.

45:19.917 --> 45:23.787
[laughter]

45:24.521 --> 45:25.089
Welcome, queens.

45:26.290 --> 45:27.891
It's time for the
judges' critiques,

45:28.959 --> 45:31.061
starting with
Marcia Marcia Marcia.

45:32.196 --> 45:33.764
So, Marcia, you had
to start the show.

45:34.498 --> 45:35.566
It's a tough gig to do.

45:36.967 --> 45:39.136
You landed some laughs,
but most of it kind of just

45:39.870 --> 45:40.671
started to fall flat.

45:41.839 --> 45:43.240
I think it just wasn't
really funny enough.

45:44.641 --> 45:46.677
But you clearly have such
a great stage presence.

45:47.845 --> 45:49.113
You just forgot
to do that logline

45:50.481 --> 45:52.082
for the movie to explain
why you picked "Die Hard 20."

45:53.217 --> 45:53.350
Like, if they could
have been like,

45:54.485 --> 45:55.786
Carson and Ross are
starring in "Top Gun 3,"

45:56.653 --> 45:59.056
just the volleyball scene.

46:00.524 --> 46:01.058
Tonight on the runway--
though, I love this look,

46:01.925 --> 46:03.227
Loosey did it not too long ago.

46:04.661 --> 46:05.963
So, if I were you, I would
have been a crafty queen

46:06.964 --> 46:07.331
and thought
of something else to do.

46:08.732 --> 46:10.701
When there are seven girls
left, it has to be more.

46:11.435 --> 46:12.803
More, more, more.

46:13.537 --> 46:15.305
Up next, Loosey LaDuca.

46:16.473 --> 46:17.341
What I like about
this look is that this

46:18.208 --> 46:18.942
is very different for you.

46:19.810 --> 46:21.078
It's creepy and Bram Stoker-y.

46:21.812 --> 46:22.813
It's just so good.

46:24.114 --> 46:24.615
In the comedy challenge,
you clearly have

46:25.482 --> 46:26.617
such a strong stage presence.

46:27.751 --> 46:28.018
And that was clear
from the jump.

46:29.186 --> 46:29.920
And so we had a lot
of high expectations,

46:31.088 --> 46:31.789
and you really rose
to the challenge.

46:32.856 --> 46:33.223
- It was really great.
- Thank you.

46:34.658 --> 46:34.925
Girl, those white jokes
were so funny to me, honey.

46:35.793 --> 46:37.795
I almost fell out of my skin.

46:38.962 --> 46:39.763
You did a really
good job tonight.

46:40.898 --> 46:43.066
All right, up next,
Luxx Noir London.

46:44.134 --> 46:44.735
- You are so funny.
- Thank you.

46:46.203 --> 46:47.571
And we had talked yesterday
about--because I couldn't hear

46:48.739 --> 46:49.006
some of the words
you were saying,

46:50.140 --> 46:51.375
and I could hear
every word you said.

46:52.242 --> 46:53.177
You were wonderful together.

46:54.044 --> 46:54.645
I thought your timing was good.

46:56.079 --> 46:56.647
I thought you were listening
to what Loosey was saying.

46:57.714 --> 46:59.483
You really did
a wonderful job, Luxx.

47:00.818 --> 47:01.518
You came here to win
this competition, didn't you?

47:02.386 --> 47:03.153
- Absolutely.
- Oh, yes.

47:03.887 --> 47:04.454
I love this look.

47:05.689 --> 47:06.223
I love the way it's a homage
to the mother.

47:06.824 --> 47:07.291
You get it.

47:08.458 --> 47:08.659
Let me just talk
about this look.

47:10.093 --> 47:10.227
[voice breaking] I'm going
to try to talk about it

47:10.961 --> 47:11.495
without crying, okay?

47:12.629 --> 47:15.065
Because I wore
this look in 1986,

47:16.433 --> 47:18.202
and it just brings back
so many great memories for me,

47:19.570 --> 47:22.105
because I was this freak
running around New York City.

47:23.540 --> 47:26.343
And if you would've asked me
if I'd be sitting in this seat

47:27.477 --> 47:28.679
hosting a television
show back then,

47:29.746 --> 47:30.514
you know what my answer
would have been?

47:31.181 --> 47:32.182
- Yes?
- Yes.

47:33.350 --> 47:35.719
[laughter]
So it all comes full circle.

47:36.620 --> 47:37.721
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

47:38.889 --> 47:39.556
[normal voice] Up
next, Sasha Colby.

47:40.724 --> 47:41.058
When you bent that
corner, I said, baby,

47:41.792 --> 47:43.327
she tore that shit up.

47:44.494 --> 47:45.996
This is why in the
comedy challenge

47:46.730 --> 47:48.732
I was like, girl, nah.

47:50.133 --> 47:51.168
You trying to rely on
this stoner stuff, honey.

47:52.336 --> 47:53.503
Yeah.
There was a lot of lulls.

47:54.371 --> 47:55.205
The pacing needed to stay up.

47:56.673 --> 47:58.475
It's really hard to make
new Michelle Visage balls

47:59.676 --> 48:00.844
and dick jokes, and
you made fresh ones

48:01.578 --> 48:02.312
that were really good.

48:03.780 --> 48:05.082
But that was probably, like,
the peak of the performance.

48:06.483 --> 48:07.718
I just wanted more of that,
and you have it in you.

48:08.785 --> 48:10.053
You're a very
naturally funny queen.

48:11.421 --> 48:13.223
You're Sasha Colby, girl.
I want more from you.

48:13.824 --> 48:14.491
Anetra.

48:15.592 --> 48:16.226
I just think for you,
there were moments

48:17.427 --> 48:18.428
like I felt you were lost
or scared,

48:19.796 --> 48:20.797
and I felt like Sasha
was doing the heavy lifting.

48:22.065 --> 48:24.067
So I wanted more confidence,
which is weird,

48:25.302 --> 48:26.203
because when
you come out here in drag,

48:26.803 --> 48:27.204
you're powerful.

48:28.071 --> 48:28.805
Michelle's absolutely right.

48:29.973 --> 48:31.074
The confidence you
have on the runway,

48:32.442 --> 48:33.510
and you have so much
confidence on this runway,

48:34.678 --> 48:38.015
is yours for the taking
throughout your life.

48:39.349 --> 48:40.817
But I am really
enjoying this look, honey.

48:41.985 --> 48:44.421
It gives me body,
and I'm a body girl.

48:45.555 --> 48:47.357
And I like the way you--
yes, do that again.

48:48.091 --> 48:48.592
Ooh, let me see that.

48:49.459 --> 48:51.795
Ooh, ooh, ooh.
[laughter]

48:52.663 --> 48:53.964
Up next, Salina EsTitties.

48:55.098 --> 48:55.933
Let's talk about
the challenge.

48:57.067 --> 48:58.201
I want to give you
credit because you got

48:59.069 --> 49:00.537
to the storyline quicker.

49:01.271 --> 49:01.672
I thought it was funny.

49:02.639 --> 49:03.407
I thought the execution
was good.

49:04.541 --> 49:05.642
I think you look
absolutely beautiful,

49:06.843 --> 49:07.711
and I love the story
that you're telling.

49:09.146 --> 49:11.315
I think I might have been even
more excited about this look

49:12.482 --> 49:15.085
had it just been a dress
made from that blanket

49:16.253 --> 49:17.454
and you had really
made it couture.

49:18.622 --> 49:19.156
I think that would
have been something

49:20.524 --> 49:22.492
that we've truly never
seen on this runway before.

49:23.093 --> 49:23.627
All right.

49:24.494 --> 49:26.630
Mistress Isabelle Brooks.

49:27.497 --> 49:28.865
This look tonight--stunning.

49:29.733 --> 49:30.734
It's burnt-up Marilyn Monroe.

49:31.601 --> 49:32.803
It's just fun.
It's drag.

49:34.237 --> 49:36.573
I love the way that you,
as a big girl, come out,

49:37.975 --> 49:38.809
and you serve the girls,
honey, letting people know,

49:40.243 --> 49:43.113
honey, that we thick girls are
gorgeously burnt up, too, okay?

49:44.348 --> 49:45.515
- Yes, ma'am.
- You also came a long way.

49:46.650 --> 49:46.783
When we were doing
the rehearsal,

49:47.951 --> 49:49.553
you were not interacting
with Salina that much.

49:50.687 --> 49:51.955
But on the day, you
guys were really

49:52.823 --> 49:53.223
bouncing off of each other.

49:54.358 --> 49:57.260
I felt like you were
two preachers delivering

49:58.128 --> 49:59.696
the unholiest of sermons.

50:00.297 --> 50:02.299
[laughter]

50:03.633 --> 50:04.568
Thank you, ladies.
I think we've heard enough.

50:05.502 --> 50:07.070
While you untuck
in the workroom,

50:08.005 --> 50:10.240
the judges and I
will deliberate.

50:11.375 --> 50:12.776
All right, now, just
between us girlfriends,

50:13.510 --> 50:14.544
what do you think?

50:15.645 --> 50:17.681
Let's start with
Marcia Marcia Marcia.

50:18.849 --> 50:20.684
Going first is not
always a bad spot.

50:22.119 --> 50:23.920
Remember when Bosco opened up
the show and she bodied it?

50:24.855 --> 50:26.656
So it can really
be an advantage.

50:28.058 --> 50:30.293
And she did fine, but for this
competition at this point,

50:31.028 --> 50:31.862
you have to do great.

50:33.330 --> 50:35.165
The thing is, she's very
green when it comes to drag.

50:36.600 --> 50:37.934
And a lot of what she
learned in theater school

50:38.702 --> 50:39.803
needs to be dragged up.

50:41.004 --> 50:42.072
All right, let's move
on to Loosey LaDuca.

50:43.540 --> 50:44.574
In the challenge, she
was kind of holding court,

50:45.776 --> 50:46.410
because she's the one
with the most experience

50:47.310 --> 50:47.844
in this between her and Luxx.

50:48.812 --> 50:49.446
And I felt very,
very comfortable

50:50.213 --> 50:50.714
and confident with her.

50:51.948 --> 50:52.482
I think they could have
been tighter as a whole.

50:53.550 --> 50:54.084
- Tighter as a whole.
- Thank you.

50:55.252 --> 50:56.553
But she was very strong
tonight in general.

50:57.287 --> 50:57.621
I was proud of her.

50:58.355 --> 50:59.189
Luxx Noir London.

51:00.323 --> 51:03.226
Every time I see her,
she always wows me.

51:04.394 --> 51:05.929
I thought she was
the most improved out

51:06.797 --> 51:07.364
of the bunch from yesterday.

51:08.732 --> 51:09.766
And on the runway,
that look was just smart.

51:10.934 --> 51:12.536
Not because it's kissing
up to you, which, hey,

51:13.570 --> 51:15.472
I'm always here for.
[laughter]

51:16.840 --> 51:19.876
But also the reimagining
of this look was so well done.

51:20.944 --> 51:21.878
- A very smart move, you know?
- Yes.

51:22.746 --> 51:24.014
Let's talk about Sasha Colby.

51:25.182 --> 51:26.249
Somehow the only
joke I can remember

51:27.717 --> 51:29.553
is Michelle's balls being
named Eureka and Latrice.

51:30.687 --> 51:31.888
- [laughter]
- That was the strongest one.

51:33.290 --> 51:34.224
Which is a good sign,
because that joke was great.

51:35.358 --> 51:35.659
But then it's kind
of a bad sign,

51:36.993 --> 51:37.360
because I don't really
remember the rest of the set.

51:38.495 --> 51:40.597
Honey, she tears those
looks up every time.

51:41.798 --> 51:45.001
But can you always
rely on your looks?

51:45.635 --> 51:46.002
I don't know.

51:46.636 --> 51:47.504
Anetra.

51:48.939 --> 51:50.006
Every time she hits the
runway, she kills it out here.

51:50.774 --> 51:52.075
She's got the best walk

51:53.410 --> 51:53.710
- in this entire competition.
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

51:55.145 --> 51:57.481
In the challenge, though, she
got so lost in the situation

51:58.915 --> 52:01.017
that I don't remember any
funny part of her skit.

52:02.185 --> 52:03.186
The pot-reference
thing really threw us

52:04.054 --> 52:04.821
into a different direction.

52:06.289 --> 52:06.623
- It also never went anywhere.
- And it never went anywhere.

52:07.724 --> 52:08.058
- Yeah.
- It didn't deliver anything.

52:09.226 --> 52:09.860
All right, let's
talk about Salina.

52:10.961 --> 52:11.528
I thought she
improved a great deal.

52:12.762 --> 52:13.497
When Michelle and I watched
the rehearsal,

52:14.898 --> 52:16.133
we sat through, like, two
presidential administrations.

52:17.000 --> 52:18.668
- [laughter]
- 100%. 100%.

52:19.536 --> 52:21.638
But she really cut out a lot

52:23.006 --> 52:25.509
and got to the juicy meat
of the story sooner.

52:26.810 --> 52:28.979
I could not stand the dress
that she was wearing

52:29.713 --> 52:30.313
underneath that jacket.

52:31.515 --> 52:32.949
She looked like she was
wrapped up in bandages.

52:34.117 --> 52:35.552
Let's move on to her
scene partner, Mistress.

52:36.686 --> 52:37.120
I thought they worked
very well together.

52:38.221 --> 52:38.855
I thought they lifted
one another up.

52:40.123 --> 52:40.957
But the story took
a little bit too long for me.

52:42.058 --> 52:42.893
And you can see her
setting it up

52:43.894 --> 52:44.794
to get to the punchline
at the end.

52:45.996 --> 52:46.463
You know, the real
meat of that story

52:47.664 --> 52:49.065
is that she just starts
giving head to a dude

52:50.367 --> 52:51.501
and one of her
rhinestones is on the tip.

52:52.969 --> 52:55.572
So she could have started the
story right then and there.

52:56.706 --> 52:58.041
But she still clearly
is a funny queen.

52:58.909 --> 53:00.210
She's just not quite there yet.

53:01.244 --> 53:02.245
All right.
[claps hands] Silence.

53:02.979 --> 53:04.314
I have made my decision.

53:05.048 --> 53:07.450
Bring back my girls.

53:08.185 --> 53:09.386
Welcome back, ladies.

53:10.253 --> 53:10.754
I've made some decisions.

53:11.354 --> 53:14.424
[dramatic music]

53:15.659 --> 53:18.962
Salina EsTitties
and Mistress Isabelle Brooks,

53:20.096 --> 53:23.099
your hook-up stories
tickled our funny bones.

53:23.833 --> 53:25.168
[music continues]

53:25.769 --> 53:27.504
You are safe.

53:28.672 --> 53:29.172
You may step to the
back of the stage.

53:30.207 --> 53:31.174
- Thank you so much.
- Gracias.

53:31.775 --> 53:33.443
[light laughter]

53:34.611 --> 53:37.314
Loosey LaDuca and
Luxx Noir London,

53:38.248 --> 53:40.283
tonight you had
the white stuff.

53:41.017 --> 53:43.320
[music continues]

53:44.521 --> 53:45.488
Condragulations, you
are both the winners

53:46.356 --> 53:46.990
of this week's challenge.

53:47.724 --> 53:48.325
[both shout happily]

53:49.492 --> 53:53.163
You've each won a cash prize
of $5,000

53:54.364 --> 53:56.166
courtesy
of Bubly Sparkling Water.

53:57.000 --> 53:58.034
- [both squeal]
- Money.

53:58.768 --> 53:59.269
Thank you so much.

53:59.869 --> 54:00.770
[squeals]

54:01.371 --> 54:02.572
I am so excited,

54:03.974 --> 54:05.041
because we honestly worked
really well together,

54:05.775 --> 54:08.178
and we both deserve.

54:08.912 --> 54:09.546
[music continues]

54:10.280 --> 54:11.948
Marcia Marcia Marcia,

54:12.816 --> 54:14.985
we needed more, more, more.

54:15.852 --> 54:18.521
Sasha Colby, to be blunt,

54:19.623 --> 54:22.659
your stoner comedy
was a little half-baked.

54:23.727 --> 54:25.962
Anetra, you
shredded the runway,

54:27.130 --> 54:28.832
but your comedy had
some holes in it.

54:29.566 --> 54:31.368
[music continues]

54:31.968 --> 54:34.804
Sasha Colby...

54:35.405 --> 54:35.872
you are safe.

54:36.606 --> 54:38.842
[music continues]

54:39.576 --> 54:40.210
Thank you so much.

54:40.944 --> 54:42.612
[music continues]

54:43.780 --> 54:45.282
Marcia, Anetra,
I'm sorry, my dears,

54:46.149 --> 54:48.752
but you are up for elimination.

54:49.953 --> 54:53.023
This is the first time
I am in the bottom two.

54:54.124 --> 54:54.891
Like, my heart
is beating so fast.

54:56.059 --> 54:57.360
I'm just, like, trying
to keep myself calm.

54:58.762 --> 54:59.929
I know that Anetra is one
of the best performers

55:01.097 --> 55:02.165
in this competition,
and I know that Anetra

55:02.899 --> 55:03.533
is going to turn it out.

55:04.834 --> 55:05.468
So I'm going to try
and turn it out just as hard.

55:06.803 --> 55:08.805
Ladies, this is your last
chance to impress me

55:10.006 --> 55:12.842
and save yourself
from elimination.

55:13.576 --> 55:15.045
[music continues]

55:15.779 --> 55:17.414
The time has come

55:18.148 --> 55:19.849
for you to lip-synch...

55:20.583 --> 55:23.219
for... your... life.

55:23.953 --> 55:26.756
[music continues]

55:27.490 --> 55:27.991
Get ready, Marcia.

55:29.125 --> 55:31.027
I'm about to show you
who's boss, bitch.

Good luck,

55:44.874 --> 55:45.442
Yeah, ain't tryna
to be cool like you

55:46.743 --> 55:47.277
Wobbling around
in your high-heeled shoes

55:47.877 --> 55:48.511
I'm clumsy

55:49.412 --> 55:49.913
Made friends
with the floor

55:51.014 --> 55:51.614
Two for one, you know

55:52.749 --> 55:53.483
And two left feet, you
know I always drop

55:54.617 --> 55:55.285
First thing a girl
did was a bop

55:56.453 --> 55:57.253
I'm the whole damn cake
and the cherry on top

55:58.455 --> 55:59.589
Shook up the bottom,
made a good girl pop

56:00.590 --> 56:00.990
You ain't even here

56:02.125 --> 56:03.026

56:04.194 --> 56:04.661

56:05.662 --> 56:06.162
Backbend

56:07.364 --> 56:08.465
I don't wanna row,

56:09.632 --> 56:11.000
Wrist full of rocks,

56:16.039 --> 56:16.573
[singing] I chew, chew, chew

56:32.722 --> 56:33.523
Don't need a report,
don't need a press run

56:34.657 --> 56:35.425
All of my bad pics

56:36.559 --> 56:37.227
I wear the hat,
and I wear the pants

56:38.628 --> 56:39.729
I am advanced, so I get
advanced, and I do my dance

56:40.463 --> 56:41.331
And cancel the plans

56:42.532 --> 56:43.099
Said, boo, don't be mad
'cause you had a chance

56:44.200 --> 56:44.768
Drop, said, I took it,

56:45.835 --> 56:47.070

57:52.469 --> 57:53.136
Yes, ma'am.

57:54.270 --> 57:55.638
Ladies, I've
made my decision.

57:56.239 --> 58:00.610
[dramatic music]

58:03.146 --> 58:05.014
Anetra...

58:05.748 --> 58:08.051
shantay, you stay.

58:09.419 --> 58:11.387
- You may join the other girls.
- [smooches] Thank you.

58:12.121 --> 58:16.426
[music continues]

58:18.228 --> 58:22.599
Marcia Marcia Marcia, we've
got much more than a hunch

58:23.333 --> 58:25.101
that you are going to be

58:25.702 --> 58:28.171
a big, big star.

58:28.905 --> 58:31.708
Now, sashay away.

58:32.842 --> 58:34.444
Thank you for helping
me evolve who I was.

58:35.645 --> 58:38.314
Thank you so much to
all of you, really.

58:39.048 --> 58:41.618
I love you, Marcia.

58:42.352 --> 58:42.986
Forget the nose.

58:43.453 --> 58:44.354
Ow...

58:44.954 --> 58:45.355
my heart.

58:45.822 --> 58:47.390
all: Aw.

58:48.124 --> 58:49.492
[music continues]

58:50.627 --> 58:52.161
I'm honestly
not super bummed.

58:53.329 --> 58:54.731
I feel really proud of
what I've done here.

58:55.765 --> 58:56.666
Having just lip-synched
against Anetra

58:58.101 --> 58:59.869
and to have actually kind
of put up a solid fight,

59:01.237 --> 59:02.672
I feel really good.
I pushed my makeup skills.

59:03.506 --> 59:04.474
Oh, wait.
[gasps] Grammar.

59:05.208 --> 59:05.708
Most importantly,

59:06.809 --> 59:07.076
Ariana Grande knows
who I am now.

59:08.211 --> 59:10.213
So, I mean, that's
worth $200,000 to me.

59:10.947 --> 59:14.150
[music continues]

59:15.018 --> 59:16.019
Condragulations, queens.

59:17.420 --> 59:19.322
And remember, if you can't
love yourself, how in the hell

59:20.456 --> 59:20.823
are you going to
love somebody else?

59:21.991 --> 59:23.192
Can I get an "amen" in here?
all: Amen.

59:24.193 --> 59:25.828
All right.
Now let the music play.

59:27.297 --> 59:30.633
[singing] A little bit of
love goes a long, long way

59:31.768 --> 59:33.036
Lifting you up
to a brighter day

59:33.770 --> 59:35.471
Can you feel the love?

59:38.708 --> 59:40.910
Next time
on "RuPaul's Drag Race"...

59:42.045 --> 59:42.745
You'll be starring
in "Wigloose."

59:43.780 --> 59:45.348
[singing] Everybody's
going wigloose

59:46.516 --> 59:47.917
There's a queen that
wants to come through

59:48.885 --> 59:52.322
Ooh, everybody's going wigloose

59:53.189 --> 59:53.990
You didn't miss a beat.

59:54.924 --> 59:55.458
Cracking me up
the whole time.

59:56.192 --> 59:56.926
I hope you have fun,

59:58.194 --> 59:59.362
because I feel
like you're a workaholic.

1:00:00.229 --> 1:00:00.763
I'm not even cutting up.

1:00:01.965 --> 1:00:02.632
I just feel like you're
not being real, Loosey.

1:00:03.800 --> 1:00:04.400
You think I'm not
being real right now?

1:00:05.268 --> 1:00:06.202
There goes Loosey lying.

1:00:06.803 --> 1:00:08.037
[dramatic music]

1:00:09.472 --> 1:00:12.976
[singing] A little bit of
love goes a long, long way

1:00:14.110 --> 1:00:16.079
Lifting you up
to a brighter day

1:00:17.246 --> 1:00:21.084
A little bit of love
goes a long, long way

1:00:22.051 --> 1:00:23.486
Turn it around when you
up and say

1:00:24.387 --> 1:00:26.489
Everybody say
love, love, love

1:00:27.223 --> 1:00:28.958
Love, oh, love, love

1:00:30.093 --> 1:00:32.695
Love, love, love,
oh, love, love

1:00:33.663 --> 1:00:35.898
Love,
can you feel the love?
