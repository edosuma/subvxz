00:38.306 --> 00:43.766
<i>I'd say you make a perfect</i>

00:44.978 --> 00:49.244
<i>Angel in the snow</i>

00:51.418 --> 00:56.914
<i>All crushed out on the way you are</i>

00:58.225 --> 01:03.492
<i>Better stop before it goes too far</i>

01:03.964 --> 01:09.925
<i>Don't you know that I love you?</i>

01:11.271 --> 01:14.762
<i>Sometimes I feel like</i>

01:14.840 --> 01:20.745
<i>Only a cold still life</i>

01:21.447 --> 01:25.281
<i>That fell down here</i>

01:25.317 --> 01:29.650
<i>To lay beside you</i>

01:39.699 --> 01:45.659
<i>Don't you know that I love you?</i>

01:52.577 --> 01:54.772
<i>- Papi, are you okay?
- What's wrong?</i>

01:54.813 --> 01:58.305
Nothing.
It's just a little tickle in my throat.

01:58.349 --> 02:01.010
- Sorry about that.
- What? No, it's fine.

02:01.051 --> 02:02.416
It's totally fine.

02:02.453 --> 02:04.944
Yeah, but, you know, sometimes

02:04.988 --> 02:07.514
when you're recovering
from a quadruple bypass,

02:07.559 --> 02:11.689
something that seems small
can be pretty big.

02:11.730 --> 02:16.099
But this isn't big. This is...
No stress here. You just relax!

02:16.734 --> 02:20.192
Do you need anything?
Like food, or more tea?

02:20.270 --> 02:22.033
Yeah, maybe something high
in Omega-3s?

02:22.072 --> 02:23.767
- Yeah.
You know what I really want?

02:23.807 --> 02:25.900
A chili dog with fries.

02:25.943 --> 02:27.137
Oh. Mmm-mmm.

02:27.177 --> 02:29.407
Heart attack or not,
that's just disgusting.

02:29.446 --> 02:31.414
<i>Papi, medical bills?</i>

02:31.448 --> 02:34.109
Didn't I tell you that we're supposed
to worry about these?

02:34.150 --> 02:35.174
I just want to help out.

02:35.218 --> 02:37.709
You can help out
by just getting better, okay?

02:37.754 --> 02:38.914
Yeah.

02:39.989 --> 02:42.423
What happened? I thought you said
you were going to send these...

02:42.458 --> 02:43.983
No, that's what I was telling you
the other day.

02:44.027 --> 02:45.119
Remember how when I was...

02:46.663 --> 02:48.289
Everything okay?

02:49.565 --> 02:52.728
Yeah. Oh! Did you just hear a bluebird?

02:53.536 --> 02:54.969
Yeah! The one that I saw out back
the other day.

02:55.004 --> 02:56.062
Uh-huh.

02:56.139 --> 02:59.006
- It's winter.
- I know. It's weird, right?

03:00.042 --> 03:02.010
I thought you were going
to send these in to insurance.

03:02.044 --> 03:04.773
They said that they could
process it faster if we faxed it in,

03:04.813 --> 03:06.610
so I figured
you could just do it from work.

03:06.648 --> 03:09.139
Okay, fine. And before I forget,

03:09.184 --> 03:12.312
I made up a checklist of things
for you not to forget to do today,

03:12.354 --> 03:15.551
- you know, to help you out.
- That is terrific.

03:15.590 --> 03:18.992
Is that in addition to all the Post-it notes
that you have left everywhere?

03:19.028 --> 03:21.621
Well, you get busy, you know.
It's easy to forget.

03:21.696 --> 03:22.754
Which reminds me,

03:22.831 --> 03:24.731
<i>you should probably
take papi in to see Dr. Steve.</i>

03:24.766 --> 03:27.894
<i>Get that cough checked out.
"Take papi to Dr... "</i>

03:27.969 --> 03:30.767
To Dr. Steve, yeah. Betty, I get it.

03:30.806 --> 03:33.969
Stop worrying. I can handle it.
Get out of here, just go. Go to work.

03:34.009 --> 03:38.502
But promise me
you're not going to wear this.

03:39.246 --> 03:40.679
No, I just ran out of clothes.

03:40.714 --> 03:43.774
I have to go back to my apartment,
which I haven't seen in, like, forever.

03:43.818 --> 03:45.809
I'm excited to see it.

03:55.262 --> 03:58.595
Betty! Oh, my God, you look fantastic!

03:59.667 --> 04:02.898
How many times did I tell you
to stop eating that fatty Mexican food?

04:02.937 --> 04:04.837
You are too young
to have a heart attack.

04:04.872 --> 04:08.136
Amanda, I didn't have a heart attack.
My dad did.

04:08.174 --> 04:09.198
Ow!

04:09.242 --> 04:10.937
How could you let me
worry about you like that?

04:10.977 --> 04:12.069
- What?
- I'm sorry, Betty.

04:12.111 --> 04:16.309
I was just really concerned about you.
Wait, your dad, is he...

04:16.349 --> 04:20.615
He's better, thank you.
It's just been a rough couple of weeks.

04:20.653 --> 04:24.418
I totally get it. I had to work extra shifts
at D.T. McDoubleshots

04:24.456 --> 04:26.321
<i>to make up for the vacation time
off at Mode,</i>

04:26.358 --> 04:30.318
and I will never ever get the smell
of fried jalapeÃ±o out of my hair.

04:30.363 --> 04:33.025
Is that why you haven't had a chance
to clean up around here?

04:33.099 --> 04:36.466
Clean? I missed you!

04:36.502 --> 04:38.833
Are these all bills?

04:38.871 --> 04:43.137
I can't believe how much I'm spending
for a place I never see.

04:43.175 --> 04:47.009
Well, I have seen it,
and, unfortunately, we have roaches.

04:47.045 --> 04:50.879
I know. At first I was scared,
and then I tried naming them. Look!

04:52.150 --> 04:55.915
That's Little Betty.
She's just like you, a survivor.

04:57.889 --> 04:59.447
Welcome home.

05:05.129 --> 05:07.189
What a great vacation, huh?

05:07.266 --> 05:09.426
You know what I think
I'm going to miss most?

05:09.467 --> 05:12.436
Running into Heidi and Spencer
everywhere we went.

05:12.470 --> 05:14.836
I know. It's like they were stalking us.

05:14.872 --> 05:17.898
I know, after a while,
didn't you kind of want to be all, like,

05:17.942 --> 05:21.139
"Heidi, how could you do that to L. C?
Come on. "

05:21.913 --> 05:26.246
Actually, can I just admit now
that I really don't know who they are?

05:26.283 --> 05:28.012
Yeah. Me, either.

05:29.653 --> 05:31.280
- You know what I miss?
- Hmm?

05:31.321 --> 05:33.551
Real photos
that you can hold in your hand.

05:33.590 --> 05:35.455
Come on. With real photos,

05:35.525 --> 05:38.050
can you do awesome slideshows
like this?

05:41.665 --> 05:43.292
Oh... Uh...

05:43.466 --> 05:44.763
Sorry.

05:46.102 --> 05:48.502
Guess we're going to have
to tell him about us eventually.

05:48.538 --> 05:49.562
I know,

05:49.606 --> 05:52.973
but he's all alone right now.
Telling him just seems cruel.

05:53.009 --> 05:55.534
Not to mention how awkward
it'll make work for both of you.

05:55.578 --> 05:57.909
Back at college,
he was definitely the jealous type.

05:57.947 --> 05:59.972
Maybe he just needs time?

06:02.017 --> 06:03.211
Yeah.

06:09.091 --> 06:12.924
<i>You have
214 new messages. Message one...</i>

06:14.329 --> 06:15.318
- Betty!
- Okay...

06:15.396 --> 06:16.385
Hey, my God, how are you doing?

06:16.464 --> 06:18.057
- Daniel!
- How is your father?

06:19.501 --> 06:21.093
What happened to your desk?

06:21.136 --> 06:25.095
Yeah, this is what happens
when I'm gone for two weeks.

06:25.140 --> 06:27.233
My dad is doing better, thank you.

06:27.276 --> 06:29.266
And thank you
for all those flowers you sent.

06:29.310 --> 06:31.574
Is 12 dozen too much?

06:31.612 --> 06:34.376
That's why you should always do
the flower ordering around here.

06:34.415 --> 06:35.712
- Yep.
- Not that you can't take

06:35.750 --> 06:37.274
as much time off as you need,
of course.

06:37.318 --> 06:39.047
No, Daniel, I need to be working.

06:39.087 --> 06:41.453
Besides, Hilda and I are going
to split the responsibilities

06:41.489 --> 06:42.751
of taking care of my father.

06:42.824 --> 06:45.257
So, what you got for me?

06:46.226 --> 06:48.524
Well, you can take my vacation photos
down to the lab.

06:48.562 --> 06:49.995
I was going to print
some of those pictures up.

06:50.030 --> 06:51.998
- Oh!
- Morning, Daniel.

06:52.032 --> 06:55.594
- Excuse me.
- Yes, yes, you're excused.

06:55.636 --> 06:58.799
No, wait, wait, you're not. Here.

06:58.840 --> 07:01.330
Cover photos
of our exclusive Halston dress.

07:01.375 --> 07:04.538
The press is already sniffing around
for them desperately.

07:04.578 --> 07:07.069
- I'll keep them someplace safe.
- What are you, dense?

07:07.114 --> 07:10.140
I want you to leak them.
I'd ask Marc, he wants to,

07:10.183 --> 07:12.117
but I hate to reward him
without any good reason.

07:12.152 --> 07:14.916
It's okay, Betty. We'll catch up later.

07:16.589 --> 07:20.184
I did miss work so,
the look of fear on people's faces.

07:21.060 --> 07:23.824
I take it from your goggle tan
you did some skiing.

07:23.863 --> 07:27.094
And I take it from your tan,
you also got some sun.

07:27.133 --> 07:31.536
Or is it that awful spray-tan?
You know, you look a bit jaundiced.

07:32.471 --> 07:34.268
- Hey.
- Hi, Connor.

07:35.941 --> 07:38.239
It looks like you did some skiing, too.

07:38.277 --> 07:39.369
Snowboarding.

07:39.412 --> 07:41.710
- I was in Switzerland.
- Aspen.

07:42.748 --> 07:45.376
Good. I'll leave you to it then, shall I?

07:47.552 --> 07:50.453
You know,
it's kind of funny you guys had the...

07:50.488 --> 07:52.012
Yes, yes, yes. Hilarious.

07:52.090 --> 07:54.957
As much as I love
your witty observations,

07:54.993 --> 07:59.157
I need to speak to Connor
about some upcoming ad meetings.

07:59.798 --> 08:01.857
Connor. Connor!

08:03.033 --> 08:04.467
Connor!

08:12.811 --> 08:15.075
We have to control ourselves.

08:15.113 --> 08:17.445
Didn't we have an agreement
we keep this out of the office?

08:17.482 --> 08:19.847
We did. I came in here to pee.

08:22.186 --> 08:23.653
So you did.

08:23.720 --> 08:28.020
Look, we had a wonderful time
in the Swiss Alps for two weeks,

08:28.058 --> 08:29.821
but now it's time to get back to work,

08:29.860 --> 08:32.054
which means we have to try harder
to hide it,

08:32.096 --> 08:34.495
starting with this.

08:35.331 --> 08:39.028
- It is a bit suspicious, isn't it?
- Suspicious?

08:39.068 --> 08:43.438
Even the special boy in the mailroom
put the two of us together.

08:43.907 --> 08:45.465
What's that?

08:45.509 --> 08:48.808
All you need to know is
that it's expensive, illegal

08:48.846 --> 08:51.871
and will even out your tan lines.

08:53.983 --> 08:56.747
You're not allergic to panda, are you?

09:00.857 --> 09:02.552
You saw nothing.

09:03.559 --> 09:04.958
- Well, actually...
- You saw nothing.

09:04.994 --> 09:06.927
- Yes, yes. No, no, no.
- Nothing!

09:06.962 --> 09:10.363
I saw nothing,
but they are about to see everything.

09:12.501 --> 09:15.027
- Thank you, Marc.
- Yeah.

09:20.076 --> 09:22.976
<i>I don't think Mom's had
a chance to talk to Dr. Steve yet.</i>

09:23.011 --> 09:25.138
Really? Well, is everything okay?

09:25.180 --> 09:26.772
No, no, it's good!

09:26.815 --> 09:29.340
This girl from my school hired Mom
to do her and her friends' hair

09:29.417 --> 09:32.079
<i>for her quinceaÃ±era party. Fifteen girls!</i>

09:32.154 --> 09:34.179
- Is that Betty? Is that Betty?
- Yes. Bye, Betty.

09:34.256 --> 09:36.417
Oh, my God, oh, my God.
Did you hear the good news?

09:36.458 --> 09:40.791
Yeah! Yeah, that's great!
I just, you know, I'm...

09:40.828 --> 09:44.025
I'm worried that you might not
have time to do all of that,

09:44.064 --> 09:46.294
<i>you know, with papi and everything.</i>

09:46.333 --> 09:49.063
What? It's work.
We need the money right now.

09:49.103 --> 09:52.140
Yeah. No, I get it. I just...

09:52.140 --> 09:53.572
You know, you haven't even
had a chance to take him

09:53.607 --> 09:55.199
to see Dr. Steve today.

09:55.242 --> 09:58.769
Betty, please stop worrying.
I got this. Okay?

09:58.812 --> 09:59.972
<i>Okay.</i>

10:00.080 --> 10:02.742
Look, I got to go. We'll discuss
this later, okay? Love you. Bye.

10:07.388 --> 10:09.150
Mrs. Meade!

10:09.189 --> 10:11.180
Sorry, I have a system.

10:11.824 --> 10:14.850
I didn't mean to snap.
I just have a lot on my plate.

10:14.894 --> 10:16.885
Well, I just came by to say hello.

10:16.930 --> 10:20.696
You're back from your trip!
How was your vacation in Paris?

10:20.733 --> 10:24.896
Well, I spent the entire time being
groped by perverts in Montmartre.

10:24.937 --> 10:26.131
I'm sorry.

10:26.172 --> 10:29.266
Why? The French still appreciate
something finely aged.

10:29.309 --> 10:31.573
I spent a lot of time
with Alexis and DJ and...

10:31.611 --> 10:35.604
Betty, I was so sorry to hear
about your father. How is he?

10:35.682 --> 10:38.014
He's good. Thank you for asking.

10:38.084 --> 10:41.985
He's got this cough, but my sister's
going to take him to see Dr. Steve.

10:42.020 --> 10:43.749
Dr. Steve?

10:43.789 --> 10:46.485
Yeah, he's our family doctor.
We've been seeing him for years.

10:46.525 --> 10:49.221
Dear, I've had many doctors.

10:49.261 --> 10:51.661
The only ones I ever called
by their first names

10:51.697 --> 10:54.461
were slipping me prescriptions
for painkillers.

10:55.566 --> 10:57.932
Well, Dr. Steve isn't like that.

10:57.969 --> 10:59.869
Tell you what, Betty.

10:59.904 --> 11:03.102
I'm on the board
of Stuyvesant Memorial.

11:03.141 --> 11:05.871
Dr. Farber is the finest cardiologist
in the city.

11:05.911 --> 11:08.402
Why don't I just call
and make your father an appointment?

11:08.447 --> 11:11.745
Oh, no, no.
I could never ask you to do that.

11:11.816 --> 11:14.885
And besides,
we would never be able to afford it.

11:14.885 --> 11:19.720
Well, Dr. Farber works
in the Meade wing of the hospital.

11:19.757 --> 11:22.385
It's not going to cost you anything.

11:28.164 --> 11:30.530
Hey, guys! I've got some good news!

11:30.567 --> 11:33.229
Good. Us, too. Talked to Dr. Steve.

11:33.270 --> 11:35.670
<i>He said it's probably just a cold
and papi's fine.</i>

11:37.475 --> 11:40.603
What'd he do? Just listen to his chest?
Take some blood samples?

11:40.645 --> 11:44.011
No, we didn't go in.
We just talked to him on the phone.

11:46.883 --> 11:49.784
- I'm fine.
- Hey, do you hear a bluebird?

11:49.819 --> 11:52.583
- It's night. It's winter.
- I don't hear anything.

11:52.622 --> 11:56.183
Well, maybe we should go and check,
you know, just in case.

11:56.226 --> 11:59.456
Hilda, I thought we were going to talk
about you taking that job.

11:59.495 --> 12:03.192
<i>I have it under control, Betty.
Dr. Steve said papi is fine.</i>

12:03.232 --> 12:04.927
It's a mild cough.
It hasn't moved to his chest.

12:04.967 --> 12:06.457
If it gets worse, then I take him in.

12:06.502 --> 12:08.732
But you haven't even had a second
to take him into the doctor,

12:08.771 --> 12:11.262
and apparently you couldn't finish
a single thing on my list.

12:11.307 --> 12:15.767
Sorry, Betty. I thought things like
de-linting his sweaters could wait.

12:15.811 --> 12:17.335
What is that?

12:18.580 --> 12:20.480
You didn't give him his pills for today?

12:20.516 --> 12:22.984
Yeah. He can't take them
before he eats. It upsets his stomach.

12:23.018 --> 12:25.009
Well, then why don't...

12:25.688 --> 12:27.986
Just want a little more tea.

12:29.191 --> 12:32.557
- I think the bird went around that way.
- Yeah. Crazy bird.

12:34.228 --> 12:36.093
Look, Claire Meade
got us an appointment

12:36.130 --> 12:38.189
with her cardiologist
tomorrow in the city.

12:38.232 --> 12:39.699
Okay, all right.

12:39.734 --> 12:42.430
<i>So I'm supposed to give up my job
with the quinceaÃ±era?</i>

12:42.470 --> 12:44.563
We still need the money!

12:46.173 --> 12:47.333
Got my tea.

12:47.374 --> 12:50.344
Good. I think I heard that bird out front.

12:53.981 --> 12:56.245
I might not do things
the way that you want me to,

12:56.284 --> 12:58.878
but you can't be Betty Bossypants
when you're off at work all day!

12:58.920 --> 13:01.513
Well, you know what, Hilda?
I only have to be Betty Bossypants

13:01.555 --> 13:03.523
when nothing gets done around here!

13:03.557 --> 13:05.889
And don't call me Betty Bossypants!

13:05.926 --> 13:08.087
Well, then stop trying
to control everything!

13:08.128 --> 13:10.392
<i>Look, you don't want to take papi
to the city, fine.</i>

13:10.430 --> 13:12.398
I'll do it. I'll take over.

13:12.432 --> 13:14.730
<i>- You'll what?
- I'll take over with papi.</i>

13:14.768 --> 13:17.395
You don't want to help,
I'll just find a way to do it all by myself!

13:17.436 --> 13:20.234
- I would like to see you try!
- I will!

13:20.272 --> 13:22.035
- Fine!
- Fine!

13:39.859 --> 13:43.158
Well, I guess there is
something everyone can agree on.

13:43.195 --> 13:46.221
<i>Dr. Farber is an excellent doctor, papi.</i>

13:48.067 --> 13:49.863
Mr. Suarez, how are you feeling?

13:49.901 --> 13:54.770
It's a little chilly. Is there some reason
it has to be so cold in here?

13:54.839 --> 13:58.639
Yes. Now, I've reviewed your chart,
and I'd like to run some tests.

13:58.676 --> 14:00.907
Dr. Steve was pretty sure
it was just a cough.

14:00.946 --> 14:03.540
Two weeks after a quadruple bypass,
you can never be too careful.

14:03.582 --> 14:06.618
<i>Yeah, and, papi, Hilda only spoke
to Dr. Steve on the phone.</i>

14:06.618 --> 14:10.486
On the phone. Terrific.
That's how I order Chinese food.

14:11.723 --> 14:13.122
Breathe.

14:13.892 --> 14:15.689
All right, again.

14:17.962 --> 14:20.191
All right, I want an x-ray.
Check for fluid in the lungs,

14:20.230 --> 14:21.993
an EKG, an echo,
and draw some blood.

14:22.032 --> 14:24.466
- CBC. Check for Dressler's?
- Yeah.

14:24.501 --> 14:26.833
- Dressler's?
- Inflammation of the pericardium.

14:26.870 --> 14:30.829
You did the right thing
bringing your father in. Who's next?

14:32.776 --> 14:35.403
See? Aren't you glad we came in?

14:35.478 --> 14:37.174
My butt is cold.

14:44.988 --> 14:49.755
You were a killer in there.
I am continuously amazed by you.

14:49.793 --> 14:52.727
Well, that makes the two of us.

14:52.762 --> 14:55.697
Marc, don't just stand there
like a gay flagpole.

14:55.731 --> 14:57.460
We want to celebrate.

14:57.500 --> 15:00.526
Go get something bubbly
and expensive.

15:01.103 --> 15:04.334
Okay. Yeah, it's what I live for.

15:06.342 --> 15:08.309
How you convinced the Guerlain people

15:08.343 --> 15:12.713
to increase their ad buy by 6%,
in this market...

15:12.748 --> 15:14.773
Well, you said the advertisers
would never do it,

15:14.817 --> 15:16.944
and I saw it as a challenge.

15:16.986 --> 15:18.453
Well, maybe when we meet with

15:18.488 --> 15:20.718
the Jaeger-LeCoultre people
this afternoon,

15:20.756 --> 15:23.553
I might get them
to increase their ad buy

15:23.592 --> 15:26.288
by, say, 7%.

15:26.328 --> 15:28.353
- What about eight?
- How about nine?

15:28.396 --> 15:30.261
- Or maybe...
- Ten?

15:33.668 --> 15:39.435
Yes. I want you to give me 10%.

15:49.784 --> 15:53.584
Collette! Klaus! Other Klaus!

15:54.288 --> 15:55.915
You're early!

15:57.491 --> 16:00.824
Jaeger-LeCoultre has put us
on a tight schedule,

16:00.861 --> 16:05.195
so we were hoping that
Wilhelmina could see us now.

16:08.202 --> 16:10.533
It's funny. You'd think people
who work for a watch company

16:10.603 --> 16:12.764
would be precisely on time.

16:14.841 --> 16:15.967
Um...

16:16.276 --> 16:17.709
Follow me.

16:28.922 --> 16:31.618
You know what?
It's an American tradition

16:31.658 --> 16:36.652
to circle the building three times
before a meeting, sometimes four.

16:39.799 --> 16:41.265
Well, it's a good thing we got him in,

16:41.300 --> 16:43.291
'cause Dr. Farber
is running a bunch of tests.

16:43.368 --> 16:45.427
<i>What tests? Is papi okay?</i>

16:45.504 --> 16:47.301
Yeah, but two weeks after
a quadruple bypass,

16:47.339 --> 16:49.034
you can never be too careful.

16:50.208 --> 16:52.005
Hilda, that's work. Can I call you back?

16:52.044 --> 16:54.979
<i>Work? Wait a minute, don't tell me
you're leaving papi there alone,</i>

16:55.013 --> 16:56.776
because I am up to my ears
in teenagers right now.

16:56.815 --> 16:58.248
I cannot just run off.

16:58.283 --> 17:00.217
No, Hilda. I told you I can handle it.

17:00.319 --> 17:03.015
<i>Look, I'll stay here with papi.
I'll call you with the results, okay? Bye.</i>

17:03.655 --> 17:05.384
- Amanda.
- Hey, Betty.

17:05.424 --> 17:06.857
Some guy from a photo lab called

17:06.892 --> 17:08.951
and said you messengered
your phone bill to him.

17:08.993 --> 17:11.359
If he pays it,
can I send him our other bills?

17:11.396 --> 17:12.692
What?

17:15.499 --> 17:18.627
Mrs. Meade, can I have that back?

17:19.270 --> 17:21.636
<i>If Daniel's photos
went to Suzuki,</i>

17:21.672 --> 17:24.106
then everything's going to go
to the wrong place!

17:24.141 --> 17:26.473
- Amanda, I need your help.
- And I would totally help you,

17:26.510 --> 17:29.444
but I'm a little busy covering
Daniel's desk, like you asked me to.

17:29.479 --> 17:31.947
I know, Amanda, but I'm at the hospital.
I can't leave.

17:31.982 --> 17:34.417
Oh, my God, is it your heart?

17:34.452 --> 17:37.319
No, it's my dad.
Haven't we had this conversation?

17:37.355 --> 17:39.949
I know, Betty, but these things
get passed down. They're generic.

17:39.991 --> 17:42.482
Look, I can't leave my father,
so I need your help.

17:42.526 --> 17:44.186
Will you help me track down
some of these letters?

17:44.227 --> 17:46.991
Okay, fine.
What do you need me to do?

17:51.301 --> 17:53.769
Marc, throw those people
out of the conference room.

17:53.837 --> 17:56.806
I need to use it
for the Jaeger-LeCoultre meeting.

17:56.873 --> 18:00.433
Actually, I'm in a good mood.
I'll throw them out myself.

18:00.476 --> 18:04.742
About that. Collette and the Klauses
have already come and gone.

18:04.780 --> 18:09.183
What? They came early?
Well, why didn't you come get me?

18:09.218 --> 18:13.053
Because you were busy snorkeling
in the Great Barrier Reef.

18:13.089 --> 18:16.182
So I was otherwise occupied.
You should've stalled them.

18:16.225 --> 18:17.453
I tried, but that's not the point.

18:17.493 --> 18:21.156
I'm worried, you know,
that you know will... You know?

18:21.196 --> 18:23.528
Marc, mince when you walk,
not when you talk. What?

18:23.599 --> 18:25.794
I don't want it getting out that
the most talented woman in fashion

18:25.868 --> 18:29.304
is missing meetings
because her head is elsewhere.

18:30.039 --> 18:31.869
Because I missed
one meeting with them?

18:31.906 --> 18:33.601
Our Swiss friends
will not leave New York

18:33.675 --> 18:35.199
without an audience with me.

18:35.243 --> 18:37.973
I'll call them. It'll all be fine. You'll see.

18:38.479 --> 18:42.438
Get Klaus on the phone, or Klaus.

18:46.555 --> 18:48.454
Betty! How's your dad?

18:48.489 --> 18:50.480
He's getting tests done,
and they won't let me see him.

18:50.525 --> 18:53.926
So, in the meantime, I've been
dealing with a little work snafu.

18:53.961 --> 18:55.292
There was a work snafu, huh?

18:55.329 --> 18:57.160
<i>It's all taken care of.
Amanda helped me.</i>

18:57.231 --> 18:58.459
Oh! That's great.

18:58.533 --> 19:00.967
The only thing left is something
I was hoping I could get done tomorrow.

19:01.035 --> 19:03.525
I have to get Suzuki St. Pierre
to swap out your vacation photos

19:03.603 --> 19:05.434
for the new picture
of the Halston dress.

19:05.472 --> 19:10.671
Wait, wait. Suzuki St. Pierre
has my vacation photos?

19:10.711 --> 19:13.908
Oh, no. You didn't ask me to print out
those type of photos, did you?

19:13.947 --> 19:15.073
<i>Again?</i>

19:15.115 --> 19:17.413
<i>Coming up, more life-ruining gossip,
but first...</i>

19:17.451 --> 19:20.044
Betty, I have to tell you something.
I'm seeing Molly.

19:21.054 --> 19:22.385
What, Connor's Molly?

19:22.422 --> 19:24.287
Look, she was with me in Saint Barts.

19:24.324 --> 19:25.518
Wait, Connor's Molly?

19:25.559 --> 19:28.585
Look, it's not what you think, okay?
We are actually in love.

19:28.662 --> 19:31.028
Daniel, you're in love
with Connor's Molly?

19:31.098 --> 19:32.190
Could you stop calling her that?

19:32.265 --> 19:34.391
They stopped seeing each other
before we got together.

19:34.467 --> 19:36.935
Well, does Connor know
about you and...

19:36.969 --> 19:39.062
No. This could be a huge disaster.

19:39.105 --> 19:41.630
I promised Molly
I was going to keep this a secret.

19:41.674 --> 19:43.471
You have to get those photos
back for me.

19:43.509 --> 19:45.602
<i>- Now?
Betty, yes, now.</i>

19:45.644 --> 19:47.578
But, Daniel, I'm at the hospital.
I have to wait...

19:47.613 --> 19:50.012
Betty, please.
There has to be something you can do.

19:51.983 --> 19:54.645
Okay, all right,
I'll find a way to get the photos back.

19:54.686 --> 19:56.484
<i>- I promise.
- Okay.</i>

19:57.256 --> 20:00.225
<i>Dr. Tesamada,
please go to the pharmacy.</i>

20:00.426 --> 20:02.394
<i>Dr. Tesamada to the pharmacy.</i>

20:03.729 --> 20:07.027
Hold it right there, missy.
No visitors during medical tests.

20:07.065 --> 20:10.034
I know. I know. I just...
I have to tell my dad

20:10.101 --> 20:12.092
I have a work emergency
that I've gotta go deal with.

20:12.170 --> 20:13.933
Well, he's gonna be in there
for at least four hours.

20:13.972 --> 20:15.633
How you spend your time is up to you.

20:15.673 --> 20:18.699
Okay, well, can you just tell him
that I'll be back as soon as possible?

20:18.743 --> 20:20.210
Yeah, okay.

20:21.012 --> 20:23.411
Okay. You can do this, Betty.

20:25.182 --> 20:28.218
- No.
- But why not?

20:28.218 --> 20:31.745
Pictures of Daniel Meade having
an affair with the fiancÃ©e of his CFO?

20:31.789 --> 20:33.382
In my business,
we call that news, honey.

20:33.424 --> 20:35.051
But she's not even
his fiancÃ©e anymore.

20:35.093 --> 20:37.322
They broke up before
she went on vacation with Daniel.

20:37.394 --> 20:40.625
- So, see? No scandal!
- Or even juicier scandal.

20:40.664 --> 20:44.065
He stole her and they ran away
on a sexy Caribbean getaway.

20:44.101 --> 20:47.070
All right, Suzuki,
can you just do this as a favor to me?

20:47.104 --> 20:48.833
- Do I know you?
- Betty Suarez!

20:48.872 --> 20:51.739
We've met, like, 1,000 times.
You've interviewed me.

20:51.775 --> 20:54.538
Sorry, I've been working
on this story for months.

20:54.577 --> 20:57.410
Really? 'Cause these pictures
literally just fell into your lap.

20:57.446 --> 20:59.914
Just good, solid journalism
is what I say,

21:00.016 --> 21:03.782
and I'm going with the story tomorrow,
so, goodbye, Benny.

21:35.984 --> 21:39.385
Marc, what the hell? Put me down!
What are you doing?

21:40.554 --> 21:42.818
Marc, I was just trying to borrow these.
Marc, what?

21:46.428 --> 21:47.554
Oh.

21:47.629 --> 21:51.258
Hello, Marc. Marc's friend.

21:51.299 --> 21:53.028
Actually, it's...

21:53.902 --> 21:56.028
"Marc's friend" is fine.

22:02.276 --> 22:05.312
Oh, my God! Are they...

22:05.312 --> 22:08.145
No, they are absolutely not.

22:09.250 --> 22:14.551
Okay, but you have to swear
not to say anything to anyone.

22:15.188 --> 22:16.450
Swear!

22:16.522 --> 22:19.048
Marc, you're hurting me!

22:19.126 --> 22:20.593
- Am I?
- Not really.

22:20.628 --> 22:24.564
But I get it, you're serious.
I'm not going to say anything to anyone.

22:24.632 --> 22:26.259
God, why are you being
so weird, anyway?

22:26.300 --> 22:29.029
Why must God test the pretty people
so much more

22:29.068 --> 22:30.160
than the regular, lumpy people?

22:32.305 --> 22:34.034
This is supposed to be my year.

22:34.073 --> 22:37.804
I got into YETI.
Willie is co-Editor-In-Chief.

22:37.844 --> 22:40.312
I just don't want her star to wane

22:40.346 --> 22:43.837
before I have a chance to cash in
on having worked for her.

22:43.882 --> 22:47.978
You know what I think?
Good things come to those who wait.

22:48.020 --> 22:49.578
Plus, it helps being pretty.

22:49.655 --> 22:52.522
Take me, I have always wanted
to work Daniel's desk,

22:52.557 --> 22:55.527
and now check me out.

22:56.763 --> 22:59.959
- Do you need to get that?
- No, it's fine.

22:59.998 --> 23:01.795
It's just I've never had
to deal with a boss

23:01.833 --> 23:04.427
who cared more about sex than work.

23:04.469 --> 23:07.131
Actually, maybe this is
what working for Daniel is like.

23:07.172 --> 23:09.037
Why are you looking at me?

23:09.074 --> 23:13.602
- Marc! There you are! I need your help.
- I need yours.

23:13.645 --> 23:16.374
When Daniel blows off
a meeting to go sleep with some floozy,

23:16.414 --> 23:18.314
- what do you do?
- What? Daniel doesn't do that!

23:18.349 --> 23:21.284
Yeah, and this is my real nose,
which it totally is.

23:21.319 --> 23:25.779
Okay, so, when Daniel gets distracted
by "life," what do you do?

23:25.856 --> 23:28.290
I just like to see those moments
as career opportunities,

23:28.326 --> 23:30.487
you know, a chance to step it up,
show Daniel what I can do.

23:30.528 --> 23:33.088
- Why? Is Wilhelmina...
- No. No. Not at all.

23:33.130 --> 23:35.690
Why would you even say that?
But she's a woman. She has needs.

23:35.733 --> 23:36.893
Get over it, Betty. Grow up.

23:36.934 --> 23:38.128
What did you want?

23:38.169 --> 23:40.000
I need to get a gift for Suzuki.

23:40.037 --> 23:42.403
I accidentally sent him something
that I need back, and I just...

23:42.440 --> 23:44.738
I have to do it fast so I can get back
to the hospital and my dad,

23:44.775 --> 23:46.071
and anyway,
I thought you could help me.

23:46.109 --> 23:48.577
A gift for Suzuki St. Pierre?

23:48.611 --> 23:51.910
He's a serious journalist.
He's not going to take a bribe.

23:51.948 --> 23:53.006
You need to blackmail him.

23:53.049 --> 23:56.246
What? Bribery, blackmail,
that's not what I was talking about.

23:56.319 --> 23:58.947
Well, too bad,
'cause his ex works at Meade,

23:59.022 --> 24:01.013
and that bitch will dish.

24:08.231 --> 24:10.222
Fabian! Fabian!

24:10.266 --> 24:12.200
Hi, you don't know me,

24:12.235 --> 24:14.032
but you might be able
to help me with a problem.

24:14.070 --> 24:16.595
I understand you dated
Suzuki St. Pierre.

24:16.639 --> 24:18.731
I can't talk about that.

24:20.342 --> 24:21.400
What? I thought you said he'd dish.

24:21.443 --> 24:22.808
Not if you approach him like that.

24:22.845 --> 24:25.211
People who've dated celebrities
are really secretive about it.

24:25.247 --> 24:26.612
Hello, I should know.

24:26.648 --> 24:27.808
You've never dated a celebrity.

24:27.850 --> 24:31.149
As far as you know. Jeremy Piven.

24:31.220 --> 24:34.245
Okay, he goosed you
on the subway once, Amanda.

24:34.322 --> 24:35.414
You talk about it constantly.

24:35.490 --> 24:39.051
The point is, you have to make him talk.
Go put the heat on, sister!

24:39.093 --> 24:40.151
Ah!

24:40.194 --> 24:44.495
Fabian! You have to help me, please?

24:45.634 --> 24:47.192
No, I don't.

24:48.703 --> 24:50.068
You tell her what she needs to know,

24:50.104 --> 24:52.834
or I will tell everyone
you have ambiguous genitalia,

24:52.874 --> 24:57.470
yeah, like a Ken doll, and that's
the kind of stank that don't wash off.

25:08.555 --> 25:11.046
Is this Suzuki's address?

25:11.124 --> 25:14.287
No. Suzuki St. Pierre
does not live in Jersey.

25:15.295 --> 25:17.196
Well, who lives here?

25:21.401 --> 25:24.165
Betty! Thank God I reached you.
It is teenage chaos here,

25:24.204 --> 25:26.331
<i>but I just wanted to check
and see how papi is doing.</i>

25:28.275 --> 25:30.937
He's fine. The nurse says he's fine.

25:32.345 --> 25:35.973
- Good. Can I talk to him?
- No. He...

25:37.049 --> 25:39.950
They won't let anybody see him
while he's getting his tests done.

25:40.786 --> 25:44.552
Yeah, I get it. I get it.
I'm just worried about him, that's all.

25:44.590 --> 25:46.490
<i>Listen, Betty, thank you.</i>

25:46.525 --> 25:51.258
I know you're crazy juggling Dad
and work and everything.

25:51.297 --> 25:52.730
<i>- Hilda...
Hilda! My hair!</i>

25:53.399 --> 25:55.026
I'm coming!

25:55.067 --> 25:58.230
Betty, let me call you back, all right?
But keep me posted. Okay, bye.

25:58.270 --> 25:59.669
Okay, bye.

26:01.841 --> 26:05.743
I guess my photos aren't all
that important in the big picture.

26:05.778 --> 26:09.304
They are. They are.
I just have a lot on my plate right now.

26:09.380 --> 26:12.816
So, what is it
you're hoping to find here?

26:12.851 --> 26:14.478
I have no idea.

26:17.288 --> 26:19.017
- Byron Wu?
Daniel!

26:19.057 --> 26:20.922
You're not supposed
to just go through people's mail.

26:20.959 --> 26:23.256
Well, we want to find out
who lives here. Who's Byron Wu?

26:23.293 --> 26:26.023
I don't know.
Maybe Suzuki's boyfriend?

26:35.306 --> 26:36.330
Get over here.

26:43.647 --> 26:44.978
SUZUKl: Hey, hey!

26:45.516 --> 26:46.847
Nice hustle today, kiddos!

26:46.884 --> 26:49.352
Now let's get dressed, get inside.
I'll go grill some brats.

26:49.419 --> 26:51.353
Right. You heard your father.

26:51.388 --> 26:54.754
- Betty, is that Suzuki?
- That's his wife and kids?

27:02.498 --> 27:03.795
Hi, Suzuki.

27:03.833 --> 27:06.200
Or should we say Byron?

27:07.371 --> 27:08.395
Crap.

27:10.740 --> 27:13.265
SUZUKl: Hit it, hit it, hit it!

27:14.243 --> 27:15.642
That's my boy.

27:17.046 --> 27:19.037
So, when I graduated
from Columbia J-School,

27:19.115 --> 27:21.879
you know, I wanted to be
Woodward, Bernstein,

27:21.918 --> 27:26.479
but the only jobs available
were Britney this, Angelina that.

27:26.521 --> 27:29.490
- But isn't that the stuff you love?
- It's the stuff Suzuki loves.

27:29.524 --> 27:32.755
Wait, so, Suzuki St. Pierre is made up?

27:32.794 --> 27:34.853
<i>You think Fashion Buzz
would go near a guy like me?</i>

27:34.963 --> 27:36.863
I mean, look at me.

27:37.032 --> 27:38.590
But as a fabulous, bitchy queen,

27:38.633 --> 27:41.761
the fashion world welcomed me
with open, well-toned arms.

27:42.971 --> 27:44.063
That's creepy.

27:44.105 --> 27:47.302
Byron, don't forget to take
the garbage out when you're done!

27:47.342 --> 27:49.003
Yeah, no prob!

27:50.078 --> 27:52.546
So down to brass tacks,
Daniel, Bessy...

27:52.614 --> 27:53.842
- Betty.
- Betty.

27:53.915 --> 27:55.906
You know my secret.
What do you want?

27:55.984 --> 27:58.417
We are not here to blackmail you.

27:58.452 --> 28:01.615
- We're not?
- No, but we do need your help.

28:01.655 --> 28:04.920
Those photos could destroy
people's lives, Byron.

28:05.559 --> 28:09.256
You have your own secret.
You should understand.

28:09.797 --> 28:12.163
You want me to try hard?

28:12.199 --> 28:13.460
Soft.

28:14.867 --> 28:16.665
I didn't think so.

28:19.106 --> 28:20.505
<i>That was nice work, Betty.</i>

28:20.541 --> 28:22.532
So, Daniel, how long do you plan

28:22.576 --> 28:24.669
on keeping this whole Molly thing
a secret?

28:24.745 --> 28:26.303
I don't know,

28:26.380 --> 28:30.873
but sometimes honesty
isn't always the best choice, I guess.

28:30.950 --> 28:32.474
I understand that.

28:32.518 --> 28:36.010
It's just secrets kind of
have a way of getting out.

28:46.398 --> 28:48.889
Don't even bother with Klaus,
either one of them.

28:48.934 --> 28:50.765
Collette's the one with the real power.

28:50.802 --> 28:52.737
The ice queen of Lake Geneva.

28:52.772 --> 28:55.104
Well, I have a feeling
you'll be able to melt her.

28:55.174 --> 28:57.699
Just flirt with her a little bit.

28:57.777 --> 29:01.803
- You'd be comfortable with that?
- Of course. It's just business.

29:02.914 --> 29:04.848
Well, I'm not sure
I'll be able to pull that off.

29:04.883 --> 29:07.215
I can't just turn it on for anybody.

29:07.252 --> 29:10.449
Really?
You've flirted with me a million times.

29:10.489 --> 29:13.822
That's because I meant it,
because it was you.

29:29.007 --> 29:32.601
So, we have been waiting for

29:34.545 --> 29:36.069
10 minutes.

29:37.315 --> 29:39.306
Well, perhaps if Wilhelmina had one

29:39.383 --> 29:43.183
of your beautiful, elegant, timeless,
handcrafted watches...

29:50.327 --> 29:52.887
- We'll come back later.
- Wait!

30:06.843 --> 30:08.606
You speak French?

30:10.113 --> 30:11.478
Actually, that's all the French I know,

30:11.514 --> 30:15.177
but if you give me just a few minutes,
I know that I can show you

30:15.218 --> 30:19.950
<i>why Mode and Jaeger-LeCoultre
are meant to be together.</i>

30:37.004 --> 30:40.065
Excuse me. Where's my father?

30:40.142 --> 30:41.939
- He left.
- He left?

30:42.511 --> 30:44.479
But you said he'd be in there
for four hours.

30:44.513 --> 30:45.980
I guess he was done early.

30:46.048 --> 30:50.246
- Well, where did he go?
- I'm sorry. I don't know what to tell you.

30:57.058 --> 30:58.116
What?

30:58.159 --> 31:00.753
Hilda, I think I might have lost Dad.

31:16.711 --> 31:20.044
All right. Somehow, we have to find
a way to get through a whole day

31:20.081 --> 31:21.742
without that always happening.

31:21.783 --> 31:26.310
Nothing wrong with creating a little
anticipation for our Swiss friends.

31:26.353 --> 31:27.843
Well, looks to me like your assistant

31:27.888 --> 31:30.015
is doing a pretty good job
of entertaining them.

31:31.691 --> 31:33.454
Purse. That's exactly what we could do.

31:33.493 --> 31:35.427
And this is the best part.
You're gonna love this.

31:35.462 --> 31:37.861
This is very exciting.
So what we do is we...

31:40.533 --> 31:42.000
Collette!

31:43.068 --> 31:45.696
Klaus! Klaus.

31:46.338 --> 31:50.537
I had no idea you were here,
which is particularly tragic,

31:50.577 --> 31:55.206
since I specifically told my assistant
to call me as soon as you all arrived.

31:55.247 --> 32:00.378
This is beginning to be a problem,
so if it happens again,

32:00.486 --> 32:03.944
it'll be back to spritzing perfume
at the makeup counter.

32:06.358 --> 32:07.848
That'll be all, Marc.

32:07.893 --> 32:08.951
Nice to look at,

32:08.994 --> 32:12.724
but you could sit a Picasso
behind his desk to do the same job.

32:14.566 --> 32:15.863
How could you have lost him?

32:15.934 --> 32:17.595
You promised me
you weren't going to leave him.

32:17.669 --> 32:19.899
I know, but there was
this emergency at work,

32:19.971 --> 32:22.371
and I might have maybe left
for just a minute.

32:22.407 --> 32:24.773
- Betty, I...
- I know, I know, you're mad at me.

32:24.809 --> 32:27.369
<i>I'm mad at me, too,
but can we just try and find papi?</i>

32:27.412 --> 32:31.007
Look, there's Dr. Farber. Dr. Farber!
Hi. Do you know where my dad is?

32:31.049 --> 32:33.711
Yeah, see, my sister sort of lost him.

32:33.751 --> 32:37.050
I talked to your dad maybe...
Maybe two hours ago.

32:37.088 --> 32:39.318
But once his tests are completed,
he's free to go.

32:39.357 --> 32:41.950
- And you have no idea where he went?
- Can't be far.

32:41.992 --> 32:45.621
Two weeks after major surgery,
he's not gonna be running a marathon.

32:47.698 --> 32:49.495
Look, I wouldn't worry about him.

32:49.566 --> 32:52.364
His tests came back normal.
He's going to be totally fine.

32:52.436 --> 32:55.303
- That's great! Thank you.
- Not a problem.

32:55.339 --> 32:58.102
<i>Did you hear that?
Papi's going to be fine!</i>

32:58.140 --> 33:01.702
Yeah. So he didn't have to come
to the hospital at all.

33:10.287 --> 33:13.983
<i>Hilda, where are you going?
The doctor said papi's going to be fine.</i>

33:14.023 --> 33:15.547
Yeah, I heard what he said.

33:15.591 --> 33:18.492
Well, then what is wrong with you?

33:18.528 --> 33:20.359
He was already fine

33:21.197 --> 33:23.427
until you came in
and decided we had to take him

33:23.499 --> 33:25.467
to some fancy Manhattan doctor,

33:25.535 --> 33:27.866
and I thought for a second,
"Okay, maybe Betty's right.

33:27.903 --> 33:29.768
"Maybe we need to be more nervous. "

33:29.804 --> 33:32.967
But you got me scared for no reason.

33:33.008 --> 33:35.033
Well, what was I supposed to do?

33:35.076 --> 33:37.136
If something's wrong,
then we have to know about it.

33:37.179 --> 33:38.771
I'll tell you what you could have done.

33:38.814 --> 33:41.180
You could have stopped trying so hard
to control everything

33:41.217 --> 33:42.912
that you scared me half to death.

33:42.952 --> 33:46.443
Hilda, if there is a problem,
then we can't just ignore it.

33:46.488 --> 33:47.648
You always do this.

33:47.689 --> 33:50.783
And you always make me feel
like everything I do is wrong.

33:50.825 --> 33:53.385
<i>Like, if I don't do things your way,
then I don't love papi!</i>

33:53.428 --> 33:54.725
When have I ever said that?

33:54.763 --> 33:57.596
It's not what you say. It's how you act.

33:57.666 --> 34:01.601
This is exactly like when Mom was sick.
Everything had to be your way.

34:01.669 --> 34:03.762
Hilda, when Mom got sick,
you disappeared.

34:03.837 --> 34:05.134
You went off with Santos or wherever,

34:05.172 --> 34:06.799
<i>and I stayed home
and took care of papi.</i>

34:06.840 --> 34:08.831
Like I'm doing now.

34:08.876 --> 34:12.904
You're in Manhattan. You got your job.
You got your apartment.

34:12.947 --> 34:14.540
Where are you?

34:15.248 --> 34:16.773
Where am I?

34:17.585 --> 34:21.453
I am here! I have been here every day.

34:21.487 --> 34:24.013
Do you have any idea
what I have had to give up

34:24.058 --> 34:25.992
so that I could be at home helping out...

34:26.025 --> 34:29.518
You want to talk about sacrifice, Betty?

34:29.597 --> 34:33.429
I live at home. I work at home.

34:33.466 --> 34:36.799
<i>And now with papi sick,
I gotta fight you to take one job.</i>

34:36.835 --> 34:40.067
Well, I need your help.
I guess I can't do it all by myself.

34:40.106 --> 34:42.472
Yeah, I guess you can't.

34:44.344 --> 34:45.641
What...

34:47.447 --> 34:50.109
You know what bothers me
the most, Betty,

34:50.149 --> 34:52.083
of all your lecturing?

34:53.920 --> 34:58.289
You weren't even there.
I was the one in the ambulance.

34:59.225 --> 35:01.386
I was the one
who was holding his hand,

35:01.494 --> 35:03.984
and I thought he was going to die,
and you know where you were?

35:04.029 --> 35:08.295
You were in the city.
You were at some party.

35:09.001 --> 35:11.094
That is not fair, Hilda.

35:14.306 --> 35:17.503
Don't you think it kills me
that I wasn't there?

35:18.342 --> 35:20.867
I think about it every single day.

35:28.487 --> 35:30.717
It's Justin. Hello?

35:30.989 --> 35:33.253
Mom? Grandpa's home.

35:36.727 --> 35:39.491
<i>Okay, papi's fine. He's at home.</i>

35:41.499 --> 35:44.468
All right. Love you.

36:11.828 --> 36:13.261
Bluebird?

36:14.464 --> 36:16.557
Come on, I'm not stupid.

36:17.167 --> 36:19.397
Look, I know you're fighting,

36:19.436 --> 36:22.131
but what I can't live with
is that you're fighting because of me.

36:22.171 --> 36:23.934
<i>- Papi, that's not true.
- Papi, honestly...</i>

36:23.972 --> 36:28.739
Please. Now, you both are strong,
intelligent, capable women,

36:28.777 --> 36:30.836
but you can't do it all.

36:31.714 --> 36:35.173
So, I've decided.

36:35.919 --> 36:38.216
I'm hiring a nurse
to help take some of the burden.

36:38.253 --> 36:39.652
- What?
- What?

36:39.688 --> 36:42.213
- We cannot afford that.
- And you're not a burden.

36:42.257 --> 36:45.021
Stop. We can afford it.

36:45.094 --> 36:46.857
I went to the Medicaid office
and found out

36:46.929 --> 36:48.920
that they'll help pay
for a part-time nurse.

36:48.997 --> 36:51.932
"Help"?
What's that supposed to mean?

36:51.967 --> 36:54.127
It means we'll manage.

36:55.169 --> 36:58.730
Look, I can't control
what happens to me,

36:59.907 --> 37:04.310
but I can control some things,
and I won't come between you two.

37:30.670 --> 37:32.638
You could use a trim.

37:48.488 --> 37:51.548
I'm sorry I wasn't there that night, Hilda.

37:52.859 --> 37:55.827
If I could go back and change it,
I would.

37:58.297 --> 38:01.027
I don't know what I would have done...

38:24.423 --> 38:27.949
A little gift from our new friends
at Jaeger-LeCoultre.

38:28.626 --> 38:31.186
We landed the account. Nice work.

38:32.263 --> 38:35.391
Great.
Now I won't be late to any meetings.

38:35.433 --> 38:37.663
I'm sorry, did I miss something?

38:37.702 --> 38:40.034
You're my assistant.
You took a hit for me.

38:40.138 --> 38:41.605
I brought you a fancy gift.

38:41.639 --> 38:44.471
I expect gratitude, not attitude.

38:44.508 --> 38:46.373
I'm sorry, Willie.

38:47.144 --> 38:50.477
But that was humiliating for me.
I was doing really well in there...

38:50.514 --> 38:52.379
It doesn't matter
how well you were doing.

38:52.416 --> 38:54.281
They didn't come here to be pitched
by some assistant.

38:54.318 --> 38:56.252
They came here to be pitched
by Wilhelmina Slater.

38:56.286 --> 38:58.846
Well, maybe I wouldn't have had
to step in if you hadn't been...

38:58.922 --> 39:00.685
If I hadn't what?

39:04.294 --> 39:07.821
It's just that I thought after four years,
I might be able to...

39:07.865 --> 39:10.060
Getting thrown under the bus
to make me look good

39:10.100 --> 39:11.727
is part of your job.

39:12.569 --> 39:15.799
Unless, of course,
you'd like to find another one?

39:15.838 --> 39:18.398
No, I don't want another job. I...

39:21.143 --> 39:23.509
Never mind. You're right. Thanks.

39:34.824 --> 39:36.451
Hey, sweetie.

39:38.561 --> 39:40.426
Okay, what's the matter?

39:40.463 --> 39:44.331
So, you know how we dodged a bullet
with our vacation photos?

39:44.367 --> 39:45.492
Yeah.

39:45.533 --> 39:47.694
Look at Page Six,
behind Heidi and Spencer.

39:47.736 --> 40:02.149
You're cut out of the picture,
but I'm not.

40:04.585 --> 40:06.610
Are you done with that?

40:28.509 --> 40:30.602
I'm off. Lunch with Tom Ford.

40:30.978 --> 40:34.208
But Proenza Schouler are coming
to meet with you at noon.

40:34.247 --> 40:37.910
Those ad meetings are so tiresome.
Why don't you take it?

40:38.718 --> 40:42.779
If you think you can handle it.
Of course I can always...

40:42.855 --> 40:45.654
Give my love to Tom and his chest hair!

41:08.914 --> 41:11.439
Cable, we can totally
just steal from upstairs.

41:11.516 --> 41:14.144
And we both have cell phones,
so we don't need a land line.

41:14.219 --> 41:17.017
Plus, I gave that number out to
too many weirdoes anyway.

41:17.055 --> 41:18.317
Oh, my God, we have so many.

41:18.357 --> 41:22.919
There's electric and gas
and maintenance and Bergdorf's.

41:22.961 --> 41:25.930
God, it is so hard to know
which one to sacrifice, you know?

41:25.964 --> 41:27.261
Mmm-hmm.

41:27.299 --> 41:32.362
Amanda, I have to tell you something.

41:37.908 --> 41:41.742
- You're moving out.
- How did you know?

41:43.748 --> 41:46.581
Because your family
needs you right now,

41:47.518 --> 41:49.611
and you're good like that.

41:52.155 --> 41:53.315
Yeah.

41:54.792 --> 41:58.558
<i>A dream of togetherness</i>

42:00.031 --> 42:04.593
<i>Turned into a brighter mess</i>

42:06.337 --> 42:09.794
<i>A faint sign my spoken best</i>

42:12.575 --> 42:15.874
<i>Now, now</i>

42:16.305 --> 42:22.498
