00:31.083 --> 00:33.166
In the mornings,
I get on and I cam.

00:34.291 --> 00:36.375
Show me what you've got, Jake.

00:38.333 --> 00:43.208
You can do a $6 a minute
where it's just you and I,

00:43.209 --> 00:45.375
but other people can watch.

00:45.376 --> 00:47.458
Nice, Jake.

00:47.459 --> 00:49.458
Keep it up.

00:49.459 --> 00:53.083
Or you can pay $8 a minute
and just be the two of us.

00:53.084 --> 00:54.959
Thank you for playing.

00:55.750 --> 00:59.083
I say, "Goodbye"...

00:59.084 --> 01:01.625
I hear the click...

01:01.626 --> 01:04.458
I immediately go and check
to see how much I've made.

01:06.125 --> 01:08.375
I get back in character...

01:09.375 --> 01:12.125
refresh button,
let's do this again.

01:13.166 --> 01:16.291
Our lives revolve around money.

01:16.792 --> 01:18.625
We earn it...

01:18.626 --> 01:21.250
spend it...

01:21.251 --> 01:22.500
lose it.

01:23.708 --> 01:26.083
The government takes its cut...

01:26.084 --> 01:28.208
while credit cards keep score.

01:29.417 --> 01:32.417
Banks keep it safe,
or so we trust.

01:33.708 --> 01:36.959
Our finances are supposed to be
within our control,

01:36.960 --> 01:38.917
but are they?

01:38.918 --> 01:40.500
Money is control...

01:41.583 --> 01:45.500
and whoever controls
the money controls us.

01:57.041 --> 01:59.166
You know, I'm actually
shocked about the amount of men

01:59.167 --> 02:02.667
that work all day
and watch cam girls.

02:03.250 --> 02:06.875
The pervs out there.

02:09.959 --> 02:13.125
A lot of my day regulars
are working.

02:13.126 --> 02:15.667
So they kind of have me
on mute

02:15.668 --> 02:16.708
or they have me
in the background,

02:16.709 --> 02:18.125
and I just chit chat.

02:18.126 --> 02:21.625
I'm working, too.

02:21.626 --> 02:23.667
This is Allie Knox.

02:23.668 --> 02:25.000
For the past two years,

02:25.001 --> 02:27.458
she's turned to the Internet
to make a living.

02:27.459 --> 02:30.291
In the beginning,
I was just camming.

02:31.333 --> 02:32.959
And when I started to see that
not match up with

02:32.960 --> 02:35.875
where I wanted to be...

02:35.876 --> 02:38.208
I went to other sources.

02:41.708 --> 02:43.333
It became my business.

02:45.375 --> 02:46.875
You want to buy dirty things?
How much?

02:46.876 --> 02:48.708
Fine, I got all kinds of shit.

02:48.709 --> 02:50.000
What would you like to have?

02:50.708 --> 02:53.000
I'll sell shoes, socks, bras,

02:53.001 --> 02:57.500
underwear, hair, Kleenexes...

03:00.542 --> 03:02.458
foot dust.

03:05.792 --> 03:08.625
They can also order customs
from me where they direct.

03:10.500 --> 03:12.041
They tell me
what they want me to say,

03:12.042 --> 03:12.667
what they want me to wear.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.083
I sold one for $450 last week.

03:22.250 --> 03:25.834
They send me gift cards
as payment.

03:25.835 --> 03:30.041
A lot of people, they don't want
to have MyFreeCams

03:30.042 --> 03:31.708
on their credit-card statement,

03:31.709 --> 03:33.417
but if they have Amazon,
it's not weird.

03:33.418 --> 03:35.542
It's not drawing a red flag
for their wife

03:35.543 --> 03:39.917
or... their company credit card.

03:42.792 --> 03:47.041
I started using PayPal when
Amazon started to limit me.

03:47.042 --> 03:51.625
You know, there's only so many
pans you can have

03:51.626 --> 03:54.125
or KIND bars you can have.

03:54.126 --> 03:56.667
I need to pay my light bill,
I need to pay my phone bill.

03:56.668 --> 03:58.792
And I need to pay it with cash.

04:00.208 --> 04:02.875
For the very short time
that I used PayPal,

04:02.876 --> 04:04.834
it was very important.

04:04.835 --> 04:06.375
If I would have been allowed
to have it open,

04:06.376 --> 04:10.208
it would be a very large
portion of my income.

04:10.209 --> 04:13.041
I don't know
how PayPal found out

04:13.042 --> 04:15.125
that I was offering them
as a payment system...

04:16.208 --> 04:18.041
but I got an e-mail
from PayPal saying

04:18.041 --> 04:19.416
that I had violated
their terms of service

04:19.418 --> 04:24.417
because I was selling
sexual-oriented content

04:24.418 --> 04:27.708
and I would not be able
to access the money

04:27.709 --> 04:29.041
in my account

04:29.042 --> 04:30.875
or no longer be able
to have an account with PayPal.

04:30.876 --> 04:32.542
It was kind of
a slap in the face.

04:32.543 --> 04:37.041
Like I'm not good enough
for you to make money off of?

04:37.042 --> 04:41.667
I was discriminated against
because I am "a sex worker"

04:41.668 --> 04:43.041
in the adult world.

04:43.959 --> 04:47.083
I feel targeted.

04:47.084 --> 04:51.875
I do so many
low-level fun things...

04:53.417 --> 04:58.166
and you're still going to put
this scarlet letter on me

04:58.167 --> 05:02.125
and, like, deem me
inappropriate or wrong?

05:04.875 --> 05:07.166
You're a payment processor!

05:07.167 --> 05:08.458
Who gave you this right?

05:12.750 --> 05:15.625
A solution
to Allie's money troubles

05:15.626 --> 05:18.041
may exist
thousands of miles away.

05:21.375 --> 05:24.250
It's here that the idea
of money was first invented.

05:27.792 --> 05:30.625
Instead of bartering
one thing for another,

05:30.626 --> 05:36.417
you could use an object
of abstract value...

05:36.418 --> 05:40.083
Seashells, copper pieces,
dollar bills.

05:41.458 --> 05:46.083
Then, as now,
cost is dictated by desire.

05:50.750 --> 05:54.291
In the remote regions
of Sichuan Province in China,

05:54.292 --> 05:56.667
a new resource
is being mined...

05:56.668 --> 06:00.708
One that may reinvent
or destroy money

06:00.709 --> 06:01.041
as we know it.

06:18.708 --> 06:20.917
This is Dang Jil Yong.

06:20.918 --> 06:22.792
He's a miner,
stuck in the mountains

06:22.793 --> 06:28.125
for weeks at a time
to provide for his family.

07:49.083 --> 07:51.583
This is a new kind of mining,

07:51.584 --> 07:55.667
not for gold or silver,
but for Bitcoin.

08:08.959 --> 08:12.792
Bitcoin is a form of digital
cash used on the Internet.

08:12.793 --> 08:16.792
It appeared online
as a monetary manifesto,

08:16.793 --> 08:18.208
a complex algorithm

08:18.209 --> 08:21.125
uploaded during
the 2008 financial crisis,

08:21.126 --> 08:23.250
a time
that dominated headlines.

08:23.251 --> 08:24.583
Prices on Wall Street...

08:24.584 --> 08:27.000
inflation,
rising unemployment...

08:27.001 --> 08:29.500
No one knows for sure
who created it,

08:29.501 --> 08:32.375
an invisible hand that wanted
to disrupt a system

08:32.376 --> 08:35.332
rife with corruption
and human error.

08:35.333 --> 08:38.375
One that puts the minting
and distribution of money

08:38.376 --> 08:41.166
in the hands of the people
and their computers.

08:42.291 --> 08:47.166
Bitcoin is decentralized
digital cash, basically.

08:47.167 --> 08:48.834
It's not physical...
You can never touch it.

08:59.041 --> 09:01.000
This is Dan Conover.

09:01.001 --> 09:04.208
He's a programming entrepreneur
who traded a cushy job

09:04.209 --> 09:07.625
with benefits for
the brave new world of Bitcoin.

09:07.626 --> 09:11.917
He's in it not just to
make money, but to remake money.

09:11.918 --> 09:13.875
I used to work at Amazon,

09:13.876 --> 09:15.875
and I had someone there show me

09:15.876 --> 09:17.667
a Bitcoin mining rig,
essentially.

09:17.668 --> 09:20.708
I didn't know what it was,
and I went home

09:20.709 --> 09:22.250
and I researched
and researched and researched

09:22.251 --> 09:24.166
all about this.

09:25.750 --> 09:29.041
It was just some of, like,
the most perfect,

09:29.042 --> 09:31.000
beautiful code I've ever seen.

09:32.708 --> 09:34.542
Bitcoin's beautiful code

09:34.543 --> 09:38.083
is just a series
of ones and zeros,

09:38.084 --> 09:39.542
code that for a time

09:39.543 --> 09:41.959
didn't have any meaning
or reason for existence.

09:43.083 --> 09:48.333
Until someone ordered two large
pizzas with all the toppings.

09:48.334 --> 09:50.625
It didn't have a value
until the pizza transaction.

09:51.417 --> 09:53.166
A guy was convinced

09:53.167 --> 09:55.417
to deliver pizza
for 10,000 Bitcoin.

09:55.418 --> 09:58.333
That was the first transaction

09:58.334 --> 10:00.375
that involved something
that had value,

10:00.376 --> 10:02.959
and that's when the price
of Bitcoin started going up.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.291
And it's been
going up ever since,

10:06.292 --> 10:10.250
with a few dips along the way,
eventually reaching

10:10.251 --> 10:13.083
a global worth
of over $10 billion.

10:13.084 --> 10:15.834
I actually ended up
leaving Amazon,

10:15.835 --> 10:19.250
and I kind of just
dove headfirst into it.

10:19.251 --> 10:22.083
That's where I met
my business partner, Sean.

10:22.084 --> 10:24.917
This is stuff I put there...
that stuff's bad.

10:24.918 --> 10:26.667
All right, where are
the good hash boards?

10:26.668 --> 10:30.959
It's the love for the Bitcoin,
or the love for the technology,

10:30.960 --> 10:32.500
that we decided
to merge our forces

10:32.501 --> 10:35.500
and become Hash the Planet

10:35.501 --> 10:38.166
and try to take over
the Bitcoin-mining world.

10:38.167 --> 10:40.041
Is that 34?

10:40.042 --> 10:42.291
They run a mining
and hosting facility

10:42.292 --> 10:44.667
where digital prospectors
can hook up their machines

10:44.668 --> 10:48.875
to stake a claim
in the Bitcoin boom.

10:48.876 --> 10:50.708
Since its world debut,

10:50.709 --> 10:54.625
Bitcoin has emerged as a rival
to the central banks.

10:54.626 --> 10:57.667
Or maybe it's a solution
in a time when

10:57.668 --> 11:01.125
global financial disruption
splashes across headlines.

11:01.126 --> 11:04.291
China continue to devalue
its currency, the Yuan.

11:04.292 --> 11:07.208
The British pound
is falling for a fourth day

11:07.209 --> 11:09.000
since the Brexit vote.

11:09.001 --> 11:12.000
Protestors blocked
the proposed austerity measures

11:12.001 --> 11:13.959
in this debt-ridden country.

11:13.960 --> 11:15.250
I think a lot of people

11:15.251 --> 11:16.333
don't trust their governments
around the world,

11:16.334 --> 11:19.542
and I think people are looking
for an alternative.

11:19.543 --> 11:21.333
It's money for the people,

11:21.334 --> 11:22.875
by the people,
and the people own it.

11:22.876 --> 11:24.166
Obviously, there's going to be
a lot of people

11:24.167 --> 11:27.291
that fucking don't like it
because of that,

11:27.292 --> 11:29.834
but that's why it's disrupting.

11:29.835 --> 11:33.667
Bad board, can't fix,
bad board, won't ever work.

11:33.668 --> 11:37.417
It's probably burnt.

11:37.418 --> 11:39.667
I do think
there's some hardcore junkies

11:39.668 --> 11:42.417
that really want a world where
it's all digital currency,

11:42.418 --> 11:43.875
but the majority
of people use Bitcoin

11:43.876 --> 11:45.375
as a way to make capital gains.

11:45.376 --> 11:48.333
Making money.

11:48.334 --> 11:50.625
But there's a few

11:50.626 --> 11:53.041
that are using it
for illegal activities.

12:06.750 --> 12:09.208
This is an admin for HANSA,

12:09.209 --> 12:11.208
a marketplace
where you can buy anything

12:11.209 --> 12:14.375
from drugs
to stolen credit cards...

12:14.376 --> 12:17.041
An Amazon for the underworld.

12:17.042 --> 12:20.333
Encrypted
or "crypto" currencies

12:20.334 --> 12:22.750
like Bitcoin
are the coin of the realm here.

12:22.751 --> 12:25.834
A buyer browses the market.

12:27.041 --> 12:30.542
He selects the amount
he wants to buy,

12:30.543 --> 12:32.166
enters shipping information,

12:32.167 --> 12:34.417
and gets directed
to the payment page,

12:34.418 --> 12:38.500
which displays the exact
Bitcoin amount he has to pay.

12:38.501 --> 12:42.792
The buyer can then
optionally give feedback...

12:42.793 --> 12:45.792
Positive, neutral or negative.

12:45.793 --> 12:48.917
The wider philosophy
of HANSA Market

12:48.918 --> 12:52.625
is creating a safe environment
to buy drugs.

12:52.626 --> 12:56.041
We understand why governments
do not allow drugs,

12:56.042 --> 12:58.542
but as with anything
that is not allowed...

13:02.041 --> 13:04.125
period.

13:04.126 --> 13:06.041
The banks have the Fed,

13:06.042 --> 13:09.000
but Bitcoin answers
only to an algorithm.

13:09.001 --> 13:13.750
It has no CEO to arrest,
no code of ethics...

13:14.667 --> 13:16.125
and there are
no terms of service.

13:17.125 --> 13:21.667
My student loans were always
the number-one factor for me

13:21.668 --> 13:23.875
getting into camming
and staying in camming.

13:26.750 --> 13:30.792
I went
to a liberal-arts school.

13:30.793 --> 13:32.291
I got a BA,

13:32.292 --> 13:35.083
and then immediately,
I got a Master's Degree.

13:35.084 --> 13:37.291
Are you ready to check out?
I am.

13:37.292 --> 13:39.917
When I graduated,
I was over $100,000 in debt.

13:41.083 --> 13:42.542
$8.19.

13:42.543 --> 13:43.792
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

13:43.793 --> 13:46.000
I started working
in the real world,

13:46.001 --> 13:47.625
and it was enough
to pay my mortgage

13:47.626 --> 13:49.792
and to pay my car,

13:49.793 --> 13:52.625
but it wasn't enough
to pay my loans.

13:53.792 --> 13:57.250
And it was just, like,
a lot of sleepless nights of,

13:57.251 --> 14:00.166
"Is this what my life
is gonna be like?

14:00.167 --> 14:01.834
I got to figure something out."

14:03.500 --> 14:05.041
When I was in college,
I actually posed for Playboy,

14:05.042 --> 14:07.834
and they had a website
at the time,

14:07.835 --> 14:09.333
which was a camming website.

14:10.500 --> 14:12.750
So I started camming,

14:12.751 --> 14:14.583
and then
started making money...

14:14.584 --> 14:15.500
Good morning!

14:15.501 --> 14:18.125
and realized,
"This is my answer."

14:18.126 --> 14:21.041
I do make customs.

14:21.042 --> 14:22.875
I was in a cam room.

14:22.876 --> 14:25.083
One guy said,
"Can I pay you in Bitcoin?"

14:25.084 --> 14:26.542
Well, I thought it was bullshit,

14:26.543 --> 14:28.291
"Fine whatever,
let's, like, walk me through."

14:28.292 --> 14:29.291
So he walked me through
and literally,

14:29.292 --> 14:31.041
three minutes later,
he's sending me cash.

14:33.500 --> 14:36.750
And then for you
to send me money...

14:36.751 --> 14:38.750
All of your money...

14:38.751 --> 14:42.333
I can just show you my QR code.

14:42.334 --> 14:45.959
You can just scan it
from your coin-based account...

14:45.960 --> 14:48.166
and send it to me
just like this.

14:50.291 --> 14:51.834
This is where
Allie's world collides

14:51.835 --> 14:54.792
with miners around the world.

14:54.793 --> 14:56.333
Imagine that a customer

14:56.334 --> 14:58.125
wanted to buy a video from her
using Bitcoin.

15:00.667 --> 15:03.542
That transaction
gets sent along to miners

15:03.543 --> 15:05.291
like Dan in Washington,

15:05.292 --> 15:07.708
to rigs in China
overseen by Dang...

15:07.709 --> 15:10.708
A global network of computers

15:10.709 --> 15:13.000
that verify the buyer
has Bitcoins

15:13.001 --> 15:13.917
and that Allie wants them.

15:13.918 --> 15:17.583
Once the transaction
is legitimized,

15:17.584 --> 15:20.375
she ends up with Bitcoins
in a Bitcoin wallet.

15:20.376 --> 15:24.250
These can be traded online
for US dollars.

15:25.291 --> 15:28.750
So basically, everyone
is running the exact same code.

15:28.751 --> 15:32.291
The miners are validating
transactions that are happening

15:32.292 --> 15:33.708
within a 10-minute period,

15:33.709 --> 15:36.750
and the first ones to validate
all the transactions

15:36.751 --> 15:41.000
essentially receive a reward
of 25 Bitcoin,

15:41.001 --> 15:43.125
which is called a block.

15:43.126 --> 15:45.875
In other words,
the Bitcoin economy depends

15:45.876 --> 15:47.625
on tens of thousands
of processors

15:47.626 --> 15:50.542
around the world
to run its algorithm.

15:50.543 --> 15:52.417
The operators
of these processors

15:52.418 --> 15:57.208
are paid by the same algorithm
in newly minted Bitcoin.

15:57.209 --> 15:59.708
Someone dubbed the term "mining"

15:59.709 --> 16:02.125
because there's only
21 million coins

16:02.126 --> 16:03.375
that will ever be released,

16:03.376 --> 16:05.583
so it's essentially like
precious metal in the earth.

16:05.584 --> 16:07.542
So you have to mine that
to get it out.

16:07.543 --> 16:08.291
There's only so much of it.

16:08.292 --> 16:09.417
Power works
fails to boot,

16:09.418 --> 16:13.291
so this is most likely
just the BeagleBoard controller.

16:14.041 --> 16:16.875
Heavy motherfuckers.

16:16.876 --> 16:20.458
It definitely out as
some kind of a passion for me.

16:20.459 --> 16:21.625
Now it's just driving
the business forward,

16:21.626 --> 16:26.375
more money, more employees,
growth, growth, growth.

16:26.376 --> 16:27.667
But this enterprise

16:27.668 --> 16:29.291
comes with
a potentially massive cost...

16:29.292 --> 16:32.291
One that impacts
more than just the wallet.

16:34.583 --> 16:38.500
These machines consume
an incredible amount of power.

16:40.875 --> 16:42.917
Right now,
we're the equivalent

16:42.918 --> 16:47.834
of 80 to 100 houses
running full power.

16:47.835 --> 16:50.625
When we're done with
our current buildout,

16:50.626 --> 16:54.875
we could be between
1,500 and 2,000 houses.

16:54.876 --> 16:56.500
I mean, that's a whole town.

16:59.041 --> 17:01.375
So, putting us here
in Washington,

17:01.376 --> 17:06.250
the hydroelectric definitely
gives us very cheap power.

17:08.834 --> 17:10.040
We're turning water into money.

17:10.041 --> 17:12.625
The water's converted
to electricity,

17:12.626 --> 17:14.333
the electricity
is converted into Bitcoin,

17:14.334 --> 17:15.541
which is money.

17:15.542 --> 17:18.165
Miners are staking
claims around the world,

17:18.166 --> 17:21.000
competing for
the cheapest power

17:21.001 --> 17:25.040
to run as many machines
as they can for greater profit.

17:25.041 --> 17:27.040
Our biggest
competitor is 100% China.

17:27.041 --> 17:29.041
Their regulations are...

17:29.042 --> 17:32.875
are almost nil,
if there are any regulations.

17:40.041 --> 17:42.125
This is Eric of HaoBTC.

17:42.126 --> 17:45.375
He makes regular visits
to this mine

17:45.376 --> 17:47.959
and is always looking
for cheaper power sources

17:47.960 --> 17:51.625
to fuel these massive centers
and hopefully expand.

18:48.625 --> 18:49.667
While China may be supersized

18:49.668 --> 18:51.417
compared to
their American counterparts,

18:51.418 --> 18:54.291
there's one thing
that they can't control...

18:55.583 --> 18:57.417
the weather.

19:27.667 --> 19:30.500
No water means no energy,

19:30.501 --> 19:33.458
which means
these machines won't run.

19:35.708 --> 19:38.625
They'll have to move
over 400 units

19:38.626 --> 19:41.458
several hours away
to another facility.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.458
While HaoBTC's rigs
are offline,

19:53.459 --> 19:58.875
some other Bitcoin miner
somewhere is cashing in,

19:58.876 --> 20:01.208
processing Allie's
latest transaction

20:01.209 --> 20:04.542
in her new enterprise
as a financial dominatrix.

20:04.543 --> 20:08.083
I think my clients
are interested in using Bitcoin

20:08.084 --> 20:09.875
because it's safe for them,

20:09.876 --> 20:11.917
specifically
in financial domination.

20:13.041 --> 20:16.375
I'm expecting everything
out of you.

20:16.376 --> 20:17.875
Every last drop.

20:17.876 --> 20:20.291
Findom is actually
financial domination.

20:20.292 --> 20:22.458
It's a fetish,

20:22.459 --> 20:27.333
all being driven
by your money, your loyalty.

20:27.334 --> 20:28.291
Now, be a good little slave.

20:28.292 --> 20:31.375
It's complete control
over your life,

20:31.376 --> 20:31.917
your thought process.

20:31.918 --> 20:34.542
Fucking payment.

20:34.543 --> 20:37.375
They want to be crippled,
they want to be controlled.

20:37.376 --> 20:40.375
That's all I want from you...

20:40.376 --> 20:43.875
is your money and your gifts.

20:43.876 --> 20:46.500
And they're tipping me
as I'm...

20:46.501 --> 20:48.708
doing this interview.

20:48.709 --> 20:51.375
Because they want me
to think about them.

20:51.376 --> 20:53.667
I'm going to crush you.

20:53.668 --> 20:55.417
It feels really amazing
to have that kind of control

20:55.418 --> 20:58.333
over someone,
specifically financially,

20:58.334 --> 21:00.834
and I can say that
because something

21:00.835 --> 21:04.792
has had a control of me,
specifically my finances,

21:04.793 --> 21:05.375
and it's been my debt.

21:07.583 --> 21:11.250
I feel like I certainly
have more control with Bitcoin.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.291
Bitcoin doesn't discriminate.

21:16.083 --> 21:18.417
Bitcoin doesn't call me
"high risk."

21:19.417 --> 21:22.750
With Bitcoin,
I don't want to say

21:22.751 --> 21:24.417
I feel any more secure

21:24.418 --> 21:26.625
than the fact that I have,
you know, cash in my pocket.

21:26.626 --> 21:30.458
If you take a dollar
and you hold a lighter up to it

21:30.459 --> 21:35.458
and catch it on fire
and you burn it, it's gone.

21:35.459 --> 21:38.500
If you lose the ability
to get into your Bitcoin wallet

21:38.501 --> 21:42.542
or send your Bitcoin
to the wrong person,

21:42.543 --> 21:44.792
well, it's pretty much gone.

22:08.875 --> 22:10.875
Whatever the intentions

22:10.876 --> 22:12.625
of its creator and adopters,

22:12.626 --> 22:15.625
Bitcoin is high-risk
and high-stakes.

22:15.626 --> 22:20.208
But deep in its code are
several unbreakable rules...

22:20.209 --> 22:25.083
One, that only 21 million coins
will ever be mined,

22:25.084 --> 22:27.291
and two,
that the amount of coins

22:27.292 --> 22:28.917
that can be mined at a time

22:28.918 --> 22:32.291
will be halved
roughly every four years.

22:34.166 --> 22:37.500
The halving could totally
affect our business operations

22:37.501 --> 22:40.333
because our customers

22:40.334 --> 22:42.667
are getting 25 Bitcoin
per block

22:42.668 --> 22:47.667
at this moment in time,
and it's going to be 12 1/2.

22:47.668 --> 22:51.291
If the price of Bitcoin
doesn't rise,

22:51.292 --> 22:54.000
then they're going to be
making half

22:54.001 --> 22:56.166
of what they were making before.

22:56.167 --> 22:58.333
I see
there's gonna be three options

22:58.334 --> 22:59.750
after the halving, basically.

22:59.751 --> 23:01.917
Option one
is the best option...

23:01.918 --> 23:04.417
Speculation
drives the price way up.

23:04.418 --> 23:09.458
Option two is woohoo,
nothing happened.

23:09.459 --> 23:12.250
Option three is the scary one...

23:12.251 --> 23:15.041
What happens
when a ton of machines

23:15.042 --> 23:16.208
become non-profitable

23:16.209 --> 23:20.041
and they just bulk unplug
and trigger huge selloffs?

23:20.042 --> 23:22.750
And so that could just
drive the price way, way down.

23:22.751 --> 23:24.750
I liken it to Y2K.

23:24.751 --> 23:26.291
There's a lot of thought
into what you could

23:26.292 --> 23:29.291
potentially do
to prepare for it,

23:29.292 --> 23:30.417
but there's really
nothing to do.

23:30.418 --> 23:34.542
You're just gonna wait
for that to happen.

23:34.543 --> 23:36.166
Everyone's known about this

23:36.167 --> 23:39.125
since the day
that they started.

24:18.250 --> 24:19.500
The Bitcoin network

24:19.501 --> 24:23.875
has grown in ways nobody
could anticipate or regulate,

24:23.876 --> 24:26.959
an algorithm running on
tens of thousands of machines

24:26.960 --> 24:30.917
and counting, mutating into
an uncertain future.

24:30.918 --> 24:32.125
What was the last
difficulty change?

24:32.126 --> 24:34.583
I'm not sure.

24:34.584 --> 24:37.166
I'm just curious how many people
are gonna unplug.

24:37.167 --> 24:39.625
Everything's being hammered
right now.

24:39.626 --> 24:40.708
Bitcoin's code is supposed to

24:40.709 --> 24:44.291
make the currency stable,
predictable,

24:44.292 --> 24:46.542
but what happens next
is anybody's guess.

24:46.543 --> 24:47.875
Yeah, it's still
about the same.

24:47.876 --> 24:48.917
Is it?
Yeah.

24:48.918 --> 24:52.208
It's currently trending
at $1,000.

24:52.209 --> 24:55.417
If miners unplug
from the network en masse,

24:55.418 --> 24:58.708
transactions could freeze,
users could panic,

24:58.709 --> 25:01.291
and the value of Bitcoin
could plunge.

25:01.292 --> 25:03.750
There's definitely a massive
selloff right now, look at that.

25:03.751 --> 25:06.166
Where you think
it's going to hit?

25:06.167 --> 25:07.708
I think
it's going to tank down

25:07.709 --> 25:09.291
to the fives and change
and stay there.

25:09.292 --> 25:12.708
That's my thought.

25:12.709 --> 25:16.000
I'm concerned
because our business is 100%

25:16.001 --> 25:19.000
directly reflected
on the price of coin

25:19.001 --> 25:21.291
and the profitability
of our customers.

25:21.292 --> 25:23.625
If they can grow, we can grow.

25:23.626 --> 25:24.417
That's all there is to it.

25:24.418 --> 25:26.583
Well,
that's it, man.

25:26.584 --> 25:29.000
As the clock strikes zero,

25:29.001 --> 25:31.750
it ushers in a new era
for Bitcoin.

25:31.751 --> 25:35.166
Newly generated
coins, look. 12.5.

25:35.167 --> 25:36.542
We're good.

25:36.543 --> 25:38.583
And the price did not go up.
Okay, so, one...

25:38.584 --> 25:39.834
No, it didn't go up.

25:39.835 --> 25:42.291
It didn't crash.
It kind of crashed.

25:42.292 --> 25:45.750
It was trending at like 660,
and now we're at 630.

25:45.751 --> 25:48.708
So it's not
the end of the world, but...

25:48.709 --> 25:51.041
we'll see.

25:51.042 --> 25:55.708
Even if Bitcoin passes
this test of its own making,

25:55.709 --> 25:59.208
it faces greater challenges
beyond its control...

25:59.209 --> 26:01.458
To win the trust of the people

26:01.459 --> 26:05.166
or become crushed under the
weight of its own algorithm.

26:08.125 --> 26:10.542
I do learn a lot
by getting screwed,

26:10.543 --> 26:12.417
and I think that I'm gonna
have to be screwed

26:12.418 --> 26:14.041
to learn more about this.

26:14.042 --> 26:15.959
And I don't even know
that it's possible to screw

26:15.960 --> 26:18.125
or be screwed with a Bitcoin,

26:18.126 --> 26:20.875
because when somebody asks me,
"Has your name gotten out?"

26:20.876 --> 26:24.333
"Has your bank account failed?"
"Did you lose money?"

26:24.334 --> 26:26.166
Answers to
those kinds of questions

26:26.167 --> 26:30.083
are gonna be what propels people
to use this.

26:30.084 --> 26:34.417
But I do know that Bitcoin
is making things better for me.

26:34.418 --> 26:35.583
Hi, Steve.

26:35.584 --> 26:39.041
I started with over $100,000
in student loans,

26:39.042 --> 26:39.917
and next month will be

26:39.918 --> 26:43.333
my two-year anniversary
of camming.

26:43.334 --> 26:46.125
I have 6K left.

26:47.583 --> 26:51.583
For the last century,

26:51.584 --> 26:55.250
governments and the
central banks regulated money.

26:55.251 --> 26:57.458
Today, it's an algorithm,

26:57.459 --> 27:00.125
a code
that has no known creator

27:00.126 --> 27:02.333
and cannot be cancelled.

27:02.334 --> 27:06.333
Tomorrow, dollars and coins
will go the way of seashells.

27:07.417 --> 27:10.583
And in the network we'll trust.
