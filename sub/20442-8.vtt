<i>Previously on</i> Good Witch...

00:02.778 --> 00:05.432
The beach house where Nick
was caught... it was my idea.

00:05.473 --> 00:08.277
I should be the jealous one, 'cause
Nick gets to live next door to you.

00:08.310 --> 00:10.487
Maybe I'm supposed to be
looking for something else.

00:10.512 --> 00:11.447
I'll help you find it.

00:11.480 --> 00:13.682
I hardly remember how we got here.

00:13.716 --> 00:15.752
I can't wait to see where we go next.

00:24.374 --> 00:28.331
- So, how was everything?
- There's a problem with dessert.

00:28.364 --> 00:32.268
- A problem?
- Yeah, it's a little too good.

00:32.301 --> 00:33.907
Yeah, Liam was saying
he's gonna have to start

00:33.932 --> 00:35.505
coming here every day just to have more.

00:35.538 --> 00:38.908
- I think you created an addict.
- Well, I am so sorry.

00:38.941 --> 00:40.999
Ah, I gotta get back to work.

00:41.679 --> 00:43.212
- See ya later.
- Okay. See ya tonight?

00:43.246 --> 00:44.445
Okay.

00:45.713 --> 00:48.417
If you guys need anything
else, just wave Jennifer over.

00:48.450 --> 00:51.454
I got a ton of end-of-the month
paperwork to finish in the back.

00:51.487 --> 00:53.890
- Okay. Thanks.
- End of the month already?

00:53.923 --> 00:56.893
- Yeah.
- Wow. Look at that...

00:56.926 --> 00:59.395
almost came and went
without me noticing.

01:00.862 --> 01:03.566
Uh, it's the week of the
anniversary of my divorce.

01:03.599 --> 01:06.369
Oh. I'm sorry.

01:06.401 --> 01:09.404
Which means it's also the week that
Sam left New York and moved here.

01:09.437 --> 01:13.175
Oh right, it is that time of year...

01:13.208 --> 01:15.710
It might not be marked on his
calendar, but it really should be.

01:15.744 --> 01:18.181
Because that was one of the best
decisions he ever made.

01:18.214 --> 01:21.451
Yeah, I'm glad he made it, too.

01:25.687 --> 01:28.857
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:28.890 --> 01:31.893
Oh, I should tell Noah
about the homework.

01:32.327 --> 01:34.463
He can find out from somebody else.

01:34.496 --> 01:37.533
- Just... come on.
- Grace...

01:38.356 --> 01:39.969
Hey.

01:40.002 --> 01:42.905
Mr. Keatty changed the assignment,

01:42.937 --> 01:44.973
so we only have to do
the even problems now.

01:45.506 --> 01:46.966
Thanks.

01:48.426 --> 01:50.679
Okay, you told him. Can we go?

01:50.713 --> 01:54.184
- Yeah, sure, I guess.
- Okay.

01:57.353 --> 01:59.020
Thanks.

02:11.866 --> 02:13.636
You guys finish your class project?

02:13.668 --> 02:16.738
- Just about.
- Oh, that reminds me,

02:16.771 --> 02:19.608
I still need someone to download
the chart and fill it in

02:19.642 --> 02:22.011
- with the comparative statistics.
- I can do it.

02:22.043 --> 02:24.713
Oh. Do you need my e-mail
to send it to once it's done?

02:24.746 --> 02:26.882
No, I've got it.

02:28.017 --> 02:30.720
Great. Then I guess we're all set.

02:30.752 --> 02:34.489
- Thank you so much for coming over.
- See you later, Grace.

02:34.523 --> 02:36.491
Bye.

02:39.862 --> 02:43.531
- What's that guy's name?
- Which one? Oh, Gavin?

02:43.565 --> 02:46.835
- The guy who likes you.
- Gavin likes me?

02:46.869 --> 02:48.670
You can't tell?

02:48.703 --> 02:51.806
That's not usually something
I'm good at noticing.

02:52.323 --> 02:55.610
Although, I thought Noah liked
me when they first got here,

02:55.644 --> 02:59.448
but ever since then he's
hardly talked to me at all.

02:59.481 --> 03:02.785
You know, whenever I was after a guy...

03:02.817 --> 03:06.021
I never said that I was
actually "after him."

03:06.055 --> 03:08.673
Okay. Never mind.

03:09.716 --> 03:11.661
Well, what'd you do?

03:12.343 --> 03:15.597
Well, I would make things happen

03:15.631 --> 03:17.900
so that he and I coincidentally ended up

03:17.932 --> 03:21.404
- at the same place at the same time.
- Isn't that kinda manipulative?

03:21.436 --> 03:25.607
All I know is I always had
a date when I wanted one.

03:35.684 --> 03:38.020
Hey. What's all this?

03:38.053 --> 03:42.557
- Your grandmother sent some photos.
- Mostly of me, but there are some of you

03:42.590 --> 03:44.693
- in here, too.
- Cool.

03:44.727 --> 03:46.411
You were so cute when you were little.

03:47.596 --> 03:49.732
Yeah, what happened?

03:49.764 --> 03:53.768
I became a father.

03:53.801 --> 03:56.839
There are so many of you on your birthdays,
but how come it's only you and your parents?

03:56.871 --> 04:00.058
My mother wasn't big
on throwing parties.

04:01.577 --> 04:04.813
But I just tried to look at the bright
side and think of it as more cake for me.

04:04.846 --> 04:07.615
He does like his cake.

04:07.649 --> 04:09.018
Um...

04:09.050 --> 04:11.686
Why am I naked in this one?

04:12.445 --> 04:14.272
When your grandma would give you a bath,

04:14.297 --> 04:16.118
you'd run around the house
with your clothes off.

04:16.791 --> 04:19.527
- He outgrew it.
- Oh.

04:19.560 --> 04:21.829
But this one,
this one's going in a frame,

04:21.863 --> 04:24.366
- if I can find a good one.
- Uh, no, it's not.

04:27.735 --> 04:29.839
This weekend marks the day

04:29.872 --> 04:32.141
that you and your dad
first came to Middleton.

04:33.235 --> 04:37.012
- Yeah, I guess it does.
- I was thinking

04:37.045 --> 04:39.682
I should do something
to honor the occasion.

04:39.931 --> 04:41.916
Surprise him with something special.

04:42.433 --> 04:44.519
My dad doesn't really like surprises.

04:45.792 --> 04:48.457
Well, that's because he's
never been surprised by me.

05:14.716 --> 05:16.050
Thanks.

05:17.802 --> 05:20.523
- Good morning.
- Oh, hey.

05:20.555 --> 05:22.591
What's all this?

05:22.623 --> 05:25.460
Cassie thought we should do
a little closet cleaning.

05:25.977 --> 05:28.763
Hey. This used to be my favorite coat.

05:29.272 --> 05:32.066
I guess that was a long time ago.

05:32.099 --> 05:35.036
You never know what things get
shoved in the back of a closet.

05:35.070 --> 05:37.405
Things you haven't
thought about in years.

05:39.282 --> 05:42.785
Oh my gosh, this was my dad's coat.

05:43.744 --> 05:46.948
- I forgot I ever put this in there.
- That was your father's?

05:46.981 --> 05:50.126
Yeah. He used to wear it all the time.

05:50.387 --> 05:52.654
And when he wasn't wearing it,
I would put it on and run

05:52.687 --> 05:55.024
around the house pretending
it was a fancy gown, or a cape.

05:55.057 --> 05:57.126
Looks like you may have grown into it,

05:57.158 --> 05:59.495
so now you can pretend it's a coat.

05:59.528 --> 06:02.698
Yeah, I guess it might fit.

06:02.731 --> 06:05.166
It's weird he never took it
with him on his last trip.

06:05.199 --> 06:07.101
His last trip to where?

06:07.852 --> 06:10.538
London. That's the last time I saw him,

06:10.572 --> 06:12.148
the day that he left.

06:13.399 --> 06:16.512
It must be hard wondering
why he never came back.

06:18.814 --> 06:23.052
- Yeah, I guess so.
- Whose was this?

06:23.084 --> 06:27.121
That's mine. I didn't realize
I had collected so many.

06:27.154 --> 06:30.158
- Can I take one?
- Whichever one you want.

06:30.192 --> 06:31.334
Ooh.

06:32.793 --> 06:34.629
This one's nice.

06:36.631 --> 06:38.968
- What do you think?
- You look good, slugger.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.236
Yeah. And if you're ever
standing at home plate

06:41.269 --> 06:43.872
ready to hit one out of the
park, you'll fit right in.

06:43.906 --> 06:45.875
Oh, I just want this for days

06:45.908 --> 06:48.309
when I don't want to fight with my hair.

06:49.769 --> 06:51.781
It's good for that, too.

07:12.901 --> 07:14.570
Hey, Noah.

07:14.603 --> 07:17.805
Don't let the principal
see you using that.

07:17.839 --> 07:20.041
She's had a "no cell phones
in school" rule

07:20.074 --> 07:22.678
ever since those things were invented.

07:22.711 --> 07:25.614
Oh. Was that in the "School
rule" pack that I got

07:25.646 --> 07:28.851
- but never read?
- Somewhere, yeah.

07:28.884 --> 07:30.977
I'll put it away.

07:32.053 --> 07:33.335
What were you watching?

07:33.360 --> 07:35.557
I've been looking at the Superman films,

07:35.591 --> 07:38.594
starting from the newest
going back to the oldest.

07:38.627 --> 07:41.163
I was watching the one
from the seventies.

07:41.195 --> 07:43.197
Kind of the best one, actually.

07:43.231 --> 07:45.283
I would have loved to see it
on the big screen.

07:46.134 --> 07:50.105
Hey. Hey.

07:51.289 --> 07:54.175
- I gotta get to Chemistry.
- I'll see you later.

07:56.502 --> 07:59.981
- What were you guys talking about?
- Movies.

08:06.262 --> 08:08.605
- Hello.
- Hey.

08:08.639 --> 08:10.192
- Hi. Hey, Eve.
- Hi.

08:10.224 --> 08:13.595
So Stephanie was selling these chocolate
chip muffins which I remembered you love.

08:13.629 --> 08:16.265
- Oh, I do love those.
- I bought you two so you can share.

08:16.298 --> 08:19.268
If you insist. Hey, take a look at this.

08:20.401 --> 08:22.204
I found this in the pictures
my mom sent me.

08:22.236 --> 08:24.606
It's me with my first love.

08:26.240 --> 08:30.245
That's a 1967 Camaro.
I bought it in high school

08:30.278 --> 08:32.298
but had to sell it to pay
for my first year of med school.

08:32.323 --> 08:33.649
Oh wow...

08:34.081 --> 08:36.851
Yeah, I'm really glad you
changed your hair since then.

08:36.885 --> 08:40.155
I'm glad we changed
everything about the eighties.

08:40.188 --> 08:42.291
Man, I loved that thing. It was perfect.

08:42.323 --> 08:45.728
Candy-apple red, with this
gorgeous wooden steering wheel.

08:45.761 --> 08:48.262
You drove around in a car
with a wooden steering wheel?

08:48.295 --> 08:51.967
Yes. Before airbags.

08:51.999 --> 08:54.802
I even carved my name into
the back of it.

08:54.835 --> 08:57.271
What I wouldn't give to wrap my
hands around that wheel again.

08:57.980 --> 08:59.308
Okay.

08:59.340 --> 09:02.010
- Here you go. Exam room one.
- Thank you.

09:02.044 --> 09:04.380
And thanks for the muffins.
Don't eat them both

09:04.412 --> 09:07.281
- before I get back.
- Yes, Doctor.

09:09.075 --> 09:10.652
So, this week

09:10.685 --> 09:13.055
marks the anniversary of
when Sam first moved here...

09:13.088 --> 09:16.324
Oh, that's right. And when
I started working for him.

09:16.358 --> 09:19.261
Right, and I was thinking of
doing something to surprise him.

09:19.294 --> 09:21.964
Maybe even get him
something he really wants.

09:21.997 --> 09:25.735
- Did you have any ideas what?
- I didn't.

09:28.260 --> 09:30.262
But I do now.

09:32.264 --> 09:33.842
<i>So, Ben,</i>

09:33.874 --> 09:36.244
if you were to do a special
showing of a movie,

09:36.277 --> 09:39.080
how many tickets would you need
to sell to make it worthwhile?

09:39.355 --> 09:42.283
- A couple dozen, maybe.
- Oh.

09:43.025 --> 09:46.087
Okay. And could you
do it tomorrow night?

09:46.121 --> 09:47.990
That's pretty soon to get the word out.

09:48.022 --> 09:51.893
- Oh, I can get the word out.
- What movie did you wanna see?

09:51.926 --> 09:54.162
<i>Superman.</i> The one
with Christopher Reeve.

09:54.195 --> 09:56.364
Yeah, I could get that
delivered here by then, sure.

09:56.951 --> 09:59.267
Great, and I'll make sure
enough people are here

09:59.300 --> 10:00.964
- to see it.
- Okay.

10:00.997 --> 10:03.587
Thanks. I'll see you tomorrow.

10:13.247 --> 10:15.950
- Hey. - Hey.
- Oh. That looks nice on you.

10:15.983 --> 10:19.187
Yeah, it fits a little better
than it did when I was nine.

10:19.220 --> 10:21.484
Oh, I saw some daisies in the window

10:21.509 --> 10:23.183
of your shop this morning.
Do you have any left?

10:23.217 --> 10:25.493
- A few.
- Could you set aside a bouquet for me?

10:25.526 --> 10:27.863
I want to send some to a friend.

10:28.487 --> 10:31.233
- Sure.
- Thanks.

10:34.441 --> 10:37.171
Oh Derek, um, do you know anything

10:37.204 --> 10:39.507
about 1967 Camaros?

10:39.541 --> 10:42.877
Only that I'm jealous of
anyone who ever owned one.

10:42.911 --> 10:45.848
- Sam owned one.
- Really?

10:45.881 --> 10:49.620
Was it was an RS? An SS? A Z/28?

10:49.653 --> 10:53.789
I only know that it was red.
I want to find something connected

10:53.821 --> 10:57.024
to that car to give Sam so
he'll always be reminded of it.

10:57.058 --> 11:01.063
Well, you'd want to know exactly what
the dealer package or accessories it had.

11:01.604 --> 11:04.365
I really don't know that much about it.

11:04.398 --> 11:07.835
Oh, but there's a picture
of it in Sam's office.

11:07.868 --> 11:10.872
- I could go take a look.
- If I can see the license plate,

11:10.906 --> 11:13.208
I can track down the VIN number
and find out all the details.

11:13.241 --> 11:16.211
That'd be really nice. I want to
surprise him with something that's...

11:16.243 --> 11:18.213
- Surprise who about what?
- Oh.

11:18.246 --> 11:20.516
Well, this is going
to be the anniversary

11:20.549 --> 11:23.819
of Sam's moving here and
I wanna mark the occasion.

11:23.852 --> 11:26.255
- With a party?
- I hadn't thought of throwing one.

11:26.287 --> 11:28.156
Well, you just have to.

11:28.190 --> 11:31.193
Sam means a great deal to all
of us. Are you going to deny us

11:31.225 --> 11:34.896
- the chance to show him how we feel?
- I wouldn't want to do that...

11:34.930 --> 11:37.132
- Then we'd better get to work.
- Stephanie!

11:37.165 --> 11:40.528
Yes. What's going on?

11:40.561 --> 11:44.072
Cassie is throwing Sam a party and I've
decided that we're all going to help.

11:44.104 --> 11:46.574
Oh, well, where and when is it?

11:46.608 --> 11:48.944
I don't know. I'm just
hearing about it right now.

11:48.977 --> 11:51.180
- But it's gonna be a surprise.
- I guess it should be.

11:51.213 --> 11:52.940
Well, I can make a cake...

11:52.965 --> 11:55.384
And I can help organize
some of the details.

11:55.416 --> 11:58.019
Chief Sanders, tell my assistant
to cancel all his plans

11:58.052 --> 12:00.454
- so he can organize the details.
- Yes, Ma'am.

12:00.488 --> 12:02.868
There. Oh, this is going to so much fun.

12:02.893 --> 12:04.560
Especially the part where
we all hide somewhere

12:04.593 --> 12:08.463
and then jump out and yell,
"Surprise!" when Sam comes in.

12:08.496 --> 12:11.233
I can hardly wait to see
the look on his face.

12:11.715 --> 12:14.510
That'll be something to see, I'm sure.

12:24.545 --> 12:27.248
This is what Sam
listens to during...

12:28.691 --> 12:30.518
Sam listens to during surgery?

12:30.551 --> 12:33.221
Yeah. He likes to have it
as loud as we'll let him.

12:33.254 --> 12:36.324
I'm sure he would love to have
this at the party, too.

12:36.358 --> 12:38.594
I can put together a list of
his favorite songs, if you want.

12:38.627 --> 12:41.889
- That'd be really sweet, thank you.
- You're welcome.

12:42.705 --> 12:44.565
- Cassie?
- Sam.

12:44.598 --> 12:46.535
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, uh...

12:46.568 --> 12:49.338
Well, I have a customer
who's having a baby soon

12:49.371 --> 12:51.547
and she wanted to know
if this would be a good place

12:51.572 --> 12:53.442
to have her child take its first breath.

12:53.474 --> 12:56.277
- Oh. Did we pass the test?
- I will tell her

12:56.310 --> 12:58.613
that the people that work here
are the best there are.

12:58.646 --> 13:01.983
- I agree.
- And, I'll see you soon.

13:02.017 --> 13:05.220
Okay. Bye.

13:12.543 --> 13:14.629
- Hey.
- Oh, Abigail!

13:14.662 --> 13:18.166
- These are a gift from Cassie.
- The card says Happy Anniversary.

13:18.199 --> 13:21.370
- They're beautiful.
- Thank you.

13:21.402 --> 13:25.206
Except my cousin always has
another reason for getting people

13:25.239 --> 13:27.074
to the places she wants them to be,

13:28.626 --> 13:31.044
and I know exactly why I'm here.

13:31.077 --> 13:32.414
Why is that?

13:32.446 --> 13:35.283
Cassie's been after me for
months to get my medical records

13:35.316 --> 13:39.053
sent from New York to here.
So how do I do that?

13:39.087 --> 13:41.556
You just need to call
the doctor's office there

13:41.589 --> 13:44.526
and give them your authorization
along with our address.

13:44.559 --> 13:47.311
Great. I'll take care of it today.

13:49.396 --> 13:51.533
- This is pretty.
- Yeah, I just...

13:51.565 --> 13:54.568
wanted something simple
to remember my trip to Paris.

13:56.107 --> 13:57.827
My dad used to bring
me back little gifts

13:57.852 --> 14:00.074
whenever he came home
from one of his trips.

14:01.234 --> 14:02.243
This one time

14:02.276 --> 14:03.861
when he came back from Paris,

14:03.894 --> 14:07.116
he brought me these cute
little ballet slippers.

14:09.284 --> 14:11.627
To remind me he had been thinking of me.

14:14.046 --> 14:17.224
- Anyway. Enjoy the flowers.
- I will. Thanks.

14:17.257 --> 14:20.528
Oh, Cassie is also planning
a surprise party for Sam.

14:20.561 --> 14:22.330
That sounds like fun.

14:22.363 --> 14:24.432
We'll let you know the details
when we figure out where.

14:24.465 --> 14:26.058
Okay, I'll see you there.

14:30.145 --> 14:31.406
<i>Have you started working</i>

14:31.439 --> 14:33.709
- on the guest list?
- I typed up some names this morning.

14:33.742 --> 14:37.478
- And we'll need decorations, of course.
- I will pick some out.

14:37.512 --> 14:40.047
You'll need to arrive at the
venue early to set them all up,

14:40.080 --> 14:42.383
and then stay afterwards
until everything's clean.

14:42.416 --> 14:43.638
Of course.

14:43.663 --> 14:46.220
Oh my, all this planning,
it's exhausting!

14:46.253 --> 14:49.031
Now, do we know when
this party's going to be?

14:49.056 --> 14:49.992
Not yet.

14:50.025 --> 14:52.327
Oh, we should ask Cassie if
she'd prefer something at night

14:52.359 --> 14:54.695
- or perhaps a luncheon affair.
- You might do this

14:54.728 --> 14:58.295
- in the middle of the day?
- So Sam will be completely surprised.

14:59.415 --> 15:00.634
Oh, Cassie,

15:00.667 --> 15:04.271
there you are. We were just talking

15:04.305 --> 15:07.008
- about the P-A-R-T-Y.
- Right,

15:07.041 --> 15:08.597
and how is that coming along?

15:08.622 --> 15:11.278
Beautifully! I have
George shopping for snacks

15:11.311 --> 15:14.015
tomorrow morning and Stephanie
already at work on a cake

15:14.049 --> 15:16.485
big enough to feed however many
dozen people we choose to invite.

15:16.517 --> 15:18.353
Oh, and how many people
have you invited so far?

15:18.386 --> 15:21.423
The mayor told me to get your
okay before I sent anything out.

15:21.455 --> 15:25.359
Give me some time to decide
who should be there, then.

15:25.392 --> 15:27.999
Just let us know. What were
you doing with Chief Sanders?

15:28.024 --> 15:29.196
Oh, Derek was helping me

15:29.229 --> 15:31.666
find a present for Sam. We're
seeing if we can track it down.

15:31.699 --> 15:34.036
Well, a gift from you
should certainly add

15:34.069 --> 15:36.204
to all the fun when we gather together

15:36.237 --> 15:39.808
- to surprise... Sam!
- Hey. What's going on here?

15:39.840 --> 15:41.486
- Uh...
- City...

15:41.511 --> 15:42.576
City business, you know.

15:42.609 --> 15:45.113
Ah, me too. Paying property taxes.

15:45.146 --> 15:48.550
Oh, well, then, you should
definitely go and pay those

15:48.583 --> 15:51.453
so that the mayor can collect
her salary. Ha, ha, ha!

15:51.486 --> 15:54.189
- This way, Jared. Don't dawdle!
- Yes, Madam Mayor.

15:55.981 --> 15:57.259
Cassie,

15:57.291 --> 16:01.095
- I wanted to see if I should... Hey, Sam.
- Hi.

16:01.128 --> 16:04.532
I just needed to talk
to Cassie about, um...

16:04.565 --> 16:07.618
Yeah, we have some city
business of our own to go over.

16:08.136 --> 16:12.406
- Well, I should let you get to it.
- Yeah. Have fun paying taxes.

16:12.440 --> 16:15.209
Ah. Yippee. See ya.

16:31.892 --> 16:35.262
Hey. Is this seat taken?

16:35.295 --> 16:38.800
- Oh. No, I guess not.
- Great.

16:39.525 --> 16:41.736
So. <i>Superman</i> on the big screen.

16:41.768 --> 16:44.271
- That's pretty cool, right?
- Yeah.

16:44.305 --> 16:46.440
Can't believe they decided
to play it right after

16:46.473 --> 16:47.948
I was talking about wanting to see it.

16:47.980 --> 16:51.178
Yeah, it's funny how things
work out sometimes.

16:52.037 --> 16:53.381
I like your hat.

16:54.373 --> 16:55.417
Oh.

16:56.291 --> 16:58.386
Thanks, yeah, it was my grandpa's.

16:58.919 --> 17:01.590
Did Nick ever tell you that
he and I used to play on a team?

17:02.297 --> 17:04.425
No, he did not.

17:04.458 --> 17:07.127
I was shortstop and he was first base.

17:08.228 --> 17:10.799
So, you guys must have spent
a lot of time together.

17:11.932 --> 17:14.136
We hung out, yeah.

17:16.065 --> 17:19.373
- Hey.
- Nick?

17:20.482 --> 17:22.511
I didn't know you were into superheroes.

17:22.943 --> 17:25.746
Yeah. I just came
to see a movie, that's all.

17:26.655 --> 17:28.583
If you had asked me, I could
have gotten you a free ticket

17:28.616 --> 17:31.185
to see this. Ben lets me
come whenever I want

17:31.218 --> 17:33.521
since I helped get this place
ready for opening night.

17:33.954 --> 17:36.323
I didn't think about
how you might be here...

17:37.082 --> 17:39.394
I can't wait to see
the cheesy special effects

17:39.426 --> 17:42.597
in a movie this old.
It's probably some guy

17:42.629 --> 17:44.765
with a cape hanging on a rope.

17:45.174 --> 17:48.369
- It's a lot better than that.
- I wasn't talking to you.

17:48.844 --> 17:50.872
I think I'm going to go
find another place to sit.

17:50.905 --> 17:53.608
- What, no. You don't have to.
- I'm going to, anyway.

17:53.640 --> 17:56.577
At least we have enough
space to spread out.

18:14.161 --> 18:15.597
Hey, George.

18:15.629 --> 18:19.266
- Oh, hi Sam.
- What are you doing out here so early?

18:19.300 --> 18:22.404
- Just picking up a few things.
- For a friend.

18:22.436 --> 18:24.705
Looks like they're having a party.

18:24.739 --> 18:28.810
- It could be...
- or maybe they just love snacks.

18:28.842 --> 18:30.678
Yeah, I guess so.

18:30.712 --> 18:32.747
- Yeah, I gotta go.
- I gotta make a delivery.

18:32.780 --> 18:35.384
- Okay. Well, have a good...
- Yeah, thanks. I will. Bye.

18:42.731 --> 18:43.992
Good morning.

18:44.024 --> 18:47.492
Hi. Your first patient called. They're
running late but said they should be here

18:47.526 --> 18:48.566
in about ten minutes.

18:48.591 --> 18:50.885
- That's fine.
- And I need you to sign this.

18:50.918 --> 18:52.666
It's the lease renewal for the office.

18:52.700 --> 18:55.237
Seems like I just signed this
a couple of months ago.

18:55.270 --> 18:57.539
It's actually been another
whole year since you did.

18:58.497 --> 19:00.541
Yeah, because it was this week
that I moved here.

19:00.575 --> 19:04.336
- It's almost like an anniversary.
- Is it?

19:05.147 --> 19:09.550
- Maybe, I don't know...
- And everyone's been planning a party.

19:10.050 --> 19:12.519
Well, I certainly wouldn't
know anything about that.

19:12.552 --> 19:14.822
That's what everybody
was doing at City Hall

19:14.856 --> 19:17.291
and why George was just
acting so strangely.

19:17.724 --> 19:20.595
You know, if anyone
<i>was</i> planning you a party,

19:20.627 --> 19:23.397
I'm sure they would want it
to be a surprise.

19:23.431 --> 19:26.531
Ugh. So now I'm gonna have
to act surprised when it happens?

19:26.556 --> 19:27.869
If it happens.

19:28.402 --> 19:31.906
Ugh. I'll have to work on
my surprised face.

19:31.938 --> 19:35.944
- That's not a very good one.
- I'll keep working on it.

19:42.550 --> 19:44.685
Hey. How did it go
at the movie last night?

19:44.718 --> 19:46.887
Did it work getting you and Noah

19:46.921 --> 19:50.525
- in the same place at the same time?
- Well, I got him there, yeah.

19:50.558 --> 19:53.528
But then Nick showed up
and messed everything up.

19:53.560 --> 19:55.896
Oh. Well, I'm sure

19:55.929 --> 19:58.032
you'll get another chance
where it's just the two of you.

19:58.066 --> 20:00.368
Yeah, maybe.

20:01.393 --> 20:04.872
- Hey. When did you get home?
- Just now.

20:04.906 --> 20:07.059
I have a favor I need done,

20:07.084 --> 20:08.576
- if you have time.
- Oh, sure.

20:08.608 --> 20:11.045
Could you download those songs
for me and make a playlist

20:11.079 --> 20:13.447
- for Sam's party?
- Sure, no problem.

20:13.481 --> 20:15.717
I can do this in-between classes
at school tomorrow.

20:16.158 --> 20:18.486
That'd be a good time
to work on it, yeah.

20:18.519 --> 20:20.934
Have you decided where
the party is going to be?

20:21.334 --> 20:22.656
No, I don't know yet.

20:23.290 --> 20:26.627
I just hope it's big enough for
everyone Martha wants to invite.

20:26.660 --> 20:28.260
She sent Jared by the shop today

20:28.285 --> 20:30.331
to see if there was anyone else
that I thought should be there.

20:30.365 --> 20:33.602
Well, I think Sam will appreciate
having all his friends in one place.

20:35.231 --> 20:37.539
Well, I better get going.
Stephanie wants me to stop by

20:37.571 --> 20:39.808
and look at different options
for Sam's cake.

20:39.840 --> 20:42.877
- Ooh, are you gonna taste samples?
- I don't think so.

20:42.909 --> 20:46.113
- Oh. Then I'll just stay right here.
- Okay.

20:48.782 --> 20:50.108
Hello, Sam.

20:50.968 --> 20:54.089
Hey. Did I catch you on your way out?

20:54.121 --> 20:56.090
Um, I was just running some errands.

20:56.124 --> 20:59.127
Well, I wouldn't want you
to be late for your errands.

20:59.701 --> 21:01.428
Then I'll see you later.

21:01.462 --> 21:04.433
Okay.

21:08.468 --> 21:10.871
Well, your mother's been
pretty busy lately.

21:11.914 --> 21:13.108
Has she?

21:13.590 --> 21:15.109
What do you think she's up to?

21:16.009 --> 21:17.844
Errands.

21:27.866 --> 21:28.889
What?

21:29.523 --> 21:31.191
Where did it go?!

21:33.819 --> 21:36.464
You've got "bad computer" face going on.

21:36.911 --> 21:40.534
Hi. Um, yeah,

21:40.568 --> 21:44.038
I'm making a playlist for a
party and I just lost a file.

21:44.882 --> 21:47.488
Nothing's ever completely lost.

21:50.673 --> 21:55.449
- Uh, what's going on?
- I, um...

21:55.483 --> 21:58.520
I'm trying to find a song file
that I just lost.

21:59.052 --> 22:00.487
There it is.

22:00.971 --> 22:02.597
Thanks.

22:05.592 --> 22:09.730
Is, uh... is that for Dad's party?

22:10.910 --> 22:11.800
Yup.

22:12.649 --> 22:15.136
Here. I'll help you finish.

22:15.915 --> 22:18.505
- Oh, I...
- Well, I guess I'll see you later, then.

22:18.539 --> 22:19.823
Yup.

22:32.220 --> 22:35.457
All right, well, let me know
if that clears things up. Bye.

22:35.964 --> 22:37.925
- Liam!
- Hey. - Hi.

22:37.958 --> 22:39.761
I thought I'd stop by to find
out if there's anything

22:39.786 --> 22:41.094
I can do to help with Sam's party.

22:41.127 --> 22:43.697
Martha's probably the one
to talk to about that.

22:43.731 --> 22:46.201
She seems to have big plans
that I barely know about.

22:47.312 --> 22:50.143
Well, you guys can use the
microbrewery, if you need a place.

22:50.175 --> 22:50.996
Oh...

22:51.021 --> 22:51.924
It's big enough to hold
all of the people

22:51.958 --> 22:53.985
- who'll want to be there.
- That is a good idea, thanks.

22:54.018 --> 22:55.472
Have you figured
out how you're gonna get Sam

22:55.497 --> 22:56.978
to show up without knowing
what it's for?

22:57.011 --> 22:58.913
Not really, no.

22:58.945 --> 23:01.249
That was the toughest part
when I tried to surprise him.

23:01.281 --> 23:04.586
- Oh, you threw him a party?
- When he left New York, yeah.

23:04.618 --> 23:07.589
Just a small gathering of friends. But
he ended up being pretty surprised.

23:07.621 --> 23:10.557
- How'd you get him there?
- I had someone tell him

23:10.590 --> 23:12.258
there was a really important
meeting about something

23:12.283 --> 23:13.861
or other and he just had to show up.

23:13.895 --> 23:15.492
Ah, hmm.

23:15.517 --> 23:18.031
So, played off Sam's diligent
sense of responsibility.

23:18.064 --> 23:19.332
That could work.

23:19.357 --> 23:22.268
Yeah. Oh, and I'm having
lunch with Sam today,

23:22.300 --> 23:24.240
so I'll let you know if he seems
the least bit suspicious.

23:24.265 --> 23:25.105
That'd be good to know.

23:25.138 --> 23:26.203
- Okay
- Thanks, bye.

23:26.236 --> 23:27.140
See ya.

23:32.746 --> 23:35.080
Still haven't found what
you're looking for?

23:35.105 --> 23:36.618
No.

23:36.650 --> 23:38.241
Remember that box that you sent over

23:38.266 --> 23:40.020
to the theater when I was fixing it up?

23:40.053 --> 23:41.785
Yeah. Things that were
just lying around.

23:41.810 --> 23:42.756
Yeah, I'm trying

23:42.790 --> 23:45.792
to find a door handle
that might match one that...

23:46.493 --> 23:49.664
- Something exactly like that.
- It's all yours.

23:49.696 --> 23:53.233
- Thanks.
- These cameras are cool.

23:53.266 --> 23:56.136
- They still work?
- No, they're just for display.

23:56.753 --> 23:59.773
But I've found that people
enjoy remembering things

23:59.807 --> 24:03.611
- from throughout the years.
- Yeah.

24:04.219 --> 24:06.146
Yeah.

24:06.638 --> 24:08.723
- Thanks for this.
- You're welcome.

24:22.629 --> 24:25.300
Make sure and finish all those
antibiotics until they're gone,

24:25.332 --> 24:26.950
even if you're feeling better.

24:28.340 --> 24:31.233
Oh, Liam called while you
were with your patient.

24:31.258 --> 24:33.041
He said he needs to cancel your lunch.

24:33.073 --> 24:35.877
- Did he say why?
- Just something came up.

24:35.909 --> 24:38.688
- Huh...
- Oh, Dr. Radford,

24:38.721 --> 24:40.022
I'm glad I caught you.

24:40.047 --> 24:42.750
I was wondering if you happened
to be free around lunchtime today.

24:42.782 --> 24:45.986
- Actually, his schedule just opened up.
- Yeah, it did. How about that?

24:46.020 --> 24:49.723
- Well, that's perfect, then.
- And convenient.

24:49.756 --> 24:51.592
I need you to come to City Hall

24:51.617 --> 24:54.094
- at one o'clock, on the dot.
- One o'clock?

24:54.127 --> 24:57.064
Yes, for some very important
Middleton business.

24:57.098 --> 24:59.014
Well, if it's very important
business, how could I say no?

24:59.039 --> 25:00.100
Promise me you'll be there?

25:00.134 --> 25:03.738
- I'll see you then.
- Wonderful. One PM. Don't be late.

25:09.909 --> 25:14.147
Well, at least we know where
and when my party will be now.

25:14.181 --> 25:17.251
The mayor said she needed you
for city business.

25:17.283 --> 25:19.686
Oh, please. My best friend
cancels a lunch

25:19.720 --> 25:22.092
which just happens to free up the
time when the mayor wants to see me

25:22.125 --> 25:25.359
and she won't tell me why? Ha!
These people need to realize

25:25.393 --> 25:27.695
who they're dealing with.

25:27.727 --> 25:29.654
As if anyone could surprise me.

25:40.006 --> 25:42.734
Oh, hey! What are you doing tonight?

25:43.693 --> 25:45.979
I barely know what I'm doing
for the next five minutes.

25:46.012 --> 25:47.415
Well,

25:47.447 --> 25:51.765
you should see this. Ben had this idea

25:51.798 --> 25:55.622
to show different classic movies after
talking with Cassie at the Bell Book.

25:56.089 --> 25:59.394
Tonight he's showing one from the
nineties: <i>Sleepless in Seattle.</i>

25:59.426 --> 26:01.586
Maybe next time.

26:06.300 --> 26:07.788
Have you ever been to Seattle?

26:07.813 --> 26:10.271
- No, you?
- No.

26:10.303 --> 26:14.891
My dad went there once. He brought me
back one of those clear dome umbrellas.

26:15.763 --> 26:18.747
I used to walk around with it during
rainstorms, feeling all protected.

26:21.281 --> 26:23.885
I still think about it
every time it rains.

26:38.861 --> 26:41.435
- Dr. Radford.
- I'm here to see the mayor.

26:41.468 --> 26:46.139
- Yes. She is expecting you.
- Oh, I'm sure she is.

26:46.173 --> 26:48.777
- You can go right in.
- I was planning to.

26:52.746 --> 26:56.850
- Surprise!
- AH!! Dr. Radford!

26:57.639 --> 26:59.921
I'm sorry. I thought
this was going to be...

27:00.454 --> 27:02.956
- something else.
- We were meeting

27:02.990 --> 27:05.760
to discuss the issue
of elder care in Middleton

27:05.792 --> 27:08.605
and we wanted to get
a medical perspective.

27:08.630 --> 27:09.863
Elder care.

27:09.896 --> 27:13.434
Mm. Well, at least you're
punctual, just as you said

27:13.466 --> 27:15.502
- you'd be.
- Yep.

27:15.535 --> 27:17.328
Right on time.

27:21.876 --> 27:26.079
- So, where were we?
- Ah. The sidewalks. Yes,

27:26.112 --> 27:27.848
I completely agree.

27:39.017 --> 27:41.529
You walked right in on
a meeting about old people?

27:41.561 --> 27:44.131
I did. I almost gave one guy
a heart attack.

27:44.165 --> 27:46.267
So I guess it's a good thing
you're a doctor.

27:46.300 --> 27:50.338
Yeah. I know this party is happening
somewhere. I just have to stay on guard.

27:50.370 --> 27:53.507
Isn't the point of being
surprised being surprised?

27:53.541 --> 27:56.511
Never gonna happen. I just hope
they get me the right kind of cake.

27:56.543 --> 27:58.812
Yellow cake, chocolate frosting, I know.

27:58.846 --> 28:02.349
- My son does know something about me.
- You ask for it every time.

28:02.383 --> 28:04.418
Yeah, but I never know
if you're paying attention.

28:04.451 --> 28:07.222
To the important things I do.

28:25.730 --> 28:28.375
So, I think I found
what you've been looking for.

28:28.408 --> 28:32.412
You can get one just like this at a
place about an hour north of here.

28:32.445 --> 28:35.116
- Is this just like what Sam had?
- Yeah, pretty much.

28:35.698 --> 28:38.820
Well, then I will drive
up there and take a look.

28:38.852 --> 28:40.888
- Thanks for tracking this down.
- Not a problem.

28:43.223 --> 28:45.193
Oh. Officer Sanders.

28:45.225 --> 28:47.294
- Hello, Grace.
- Hi, Mom.

28:47.328 --> 28:49.096
- Hey, honey.
- What's that?

28:49.121 --> 28:50.798
Oh. Something for Sam.

28:51.272 --> 28:54.502
Oh, did you get a chance to
finish that playlist at school?

28:54.534 --> 28:57.543
Yeah. I had to work through

28:57.568 --> 28:59.406
a couple of unexpected things,

28:59.439 --> 29:02.275
- but... it's done.
- Thank you.

29:02.309 --> 29:05.312
Oh, and don't forget to invite
Noah to the party, too.

29:05.346 --> 29:07.522
He's probably coming with his dad.

29:08.048 --> 29:10.885
I just thought he might like a
more personal invitation from you.

29:11.609 --> 29:14.921
I don't think he's interested
in anything personal from me.

29:14.954 --> 29:18.425
I've been trying to get
the two of us together...

29:18.825 --> 29:22.028
get the two of us
in the same place together,

29:22.061 --> 29:24.197
and every time Nick shows up and
the two of them start arguing.

29:24.231 --> 29:26.200
Are they just not getting along at all?

29:26.233 --> 29:28.869
No. They can hardly stand
being near each other.

29:29.419 --> 29:34.108
I wonder if there's a way those two could
take a swing at being friends again?

29:34.140 --> 29:36.543
I don't think that's
ever going to happen.

29:37.093 --> 29:39.446
- It could happen.
- If they had some help

29:39.480 --> 29:41.180
getting together.

29:45.018 --> 29:46.186
Grandpa's right.

29:46.769 --> 29:48.563
You look good, slugger.

29:55.971 --> 29:57.665
Have we got the invitation list?

29:57.697 --> 30:00.066
Yes, but it's longer than it should be.

30:00.099 --> 30:02.637
How long? Am I going to have
to make food and a cake?

30:02.669 --> 30:05.572
If we have it at the microbrewery
I could serve stuff there.

30:05.606 --> 30:07.508
We haven't decided
where it's going to be.

30:07.541 --> 30:10.578
He's already suspicious
we're throwing a party.

30:10.610 --> 30:13.079
Well, then we'll have to be very
clever about how we get him there.

30:13.112 --> 30:15.482
Except we don't even know
where it's going to be yet.

30:15.515 --> 30:18.985
Cassie has told me that she's
just about ready to decide.

30:19.019 --> 30:22.123
I'll be the one who helps trick him
into getting him where we want him to go.

30:22.156 --> 30:24.959
Except he already knows
that you're in on it.

30:24.992 --> 30:28.596
Really? I used to think
my poker face was pretty good.

30:28.628 --> 30:31.464
- It's not.
- Hm!

30:31.498 --> 30:35.202
Listen, we've got everything
ready to go. We just have to wait

30:35.234 --> 30:38.004
for Cassie's go-ahead and then we
can send out the official invite

30:38.038 --> 30:42.343
to what I'm sure will be the party of the
year! What's our body count, by the way?

30:42.376 --> 30:46.280
I'm not sure, but looks like
we're up to four pages.

30:46.312 --> 30:48.482
Oh, remember to include
yourself on that list.

30:49.040 --> 30:50.984
I didn't realize I was invited.

30:51.018 --> 30:54.656
It's just so when the e-mail blast
goes out, you can confirm that it did.

31:02.428 --> 31:04.598
- Dr. Sam Radford?
- That's me.

31:04.630 --> 31:08.101
- I'm looking for Abigail Pershing.
- She might be a patient here?

31:08.135 --> 31:11.204
- What's this regarding?
- I was hoping to get a home address.

31:11.237 --> 31:14.374
I can't give out any
information about someone

31:14.407 --> 31:17.177
I may or may not be seeing.
It's doctor-patient privilege.

31:17.986 --> 31:20.146
We tracked her here
when we got a notification

31:20.179 --> 31:22.449
that she was having her medical
records sent to you.

31:23.157 --> 31:26.052
I can't confirm if she did
that or not, sorry.

31:26.912 --> 31:30.324
I have something that she was
supposed to receive twenty years ago.

31:30.832 --> 31:32.079
Twenty years?

31:32.104 --> 31:34.544
I was really hoping
to get it delivered today.

31:48.391 --> 31:50.310
Grace.

31:50.343 --> 31:52.112
Oh. Noah.

31:53.062 --> 31:55.549
I didn't know Middleton
had a place like this.

31:55.581 --> 31:58.451
- Yeah. It just opened.
- A couple guys texted me

31:58.484 --> 32:00.687
saying they had some batting
cages, so I thought

32:00.721 --> 32:02.221
I'd come by and hit a few.

32:02.246 --> 32:04.583
It looks like a lot
of people are doing the same.

32:08.148 --> 32:10.598
- Hey.
- Hey.

32:11.289 --> 32:15.335
- Oh, look, a cage just opened up.
- You guys wanna take a few swings?

32:15.368 --> 32:18.238
- You should give it a try, too.
- Uh, no,

32:18.271 --> 32:20.465
I think I might just be
a spectator today.

32:22.759 --> 32:25.179
The pitching machines look pretty good.

32:26.547 --> 32:28.482
As long as they throw better
than you do.

32:28.514 --> 32:30.684
Oh, so you mean "right
into your glove every time"

32:30.716 --> 32:32.088
wasn't good enough?

32:32.113 --> 32:34.821
- You were pretty close,
most of the time.

32:35.396 --> 32:37.825
There was this one game,
we were up by one,

32:37.858 --> 32:40.461
top of the ninth, one out,
and a guy on first.

32:40.493 --> 32:42.872
- Do you remember that?
- Of course I do.

32:42.906 --> 32:45.266
The batter, he hits a line drive

32:45.299 --> 32:47.733
towards the gap. The runner, he goes...

32:47.766 --> 32:50.069
Noah snatches the ball right
out of the air for the one out...

32:50.104 --> 32:52.513
I toss it back to Nick,
he touches first for the second.

32:52.538 --> 32:53.974
Double play ends the game.

32:54.999 --> 32:57.211
It seems like you guys
played really well together.

32:57.243 --> 33:00.214
- Yeah, I guess.
- We were all right.

33:02.381 --> 33:06.152
I would be up to swinging
at a few with you, if you want.

33:08.150 --> 33:09.322
That sounds okay.

33:10.223 --> 33:13.327
Well. You guys have fun.

33:13.893 --> 33:16.129
- Sure you don't wanna join us?
- Nah.

33:16.163 --> 33:18.106
You guys should do this one without me.

33:19.899 --> 33:21.400
Bye.

33:44.048 --> 33:45.591
Abigail Pershing?

33:46.592 --> 33:47.894
That's me.

33:48.761 --> 33:50.897
I'm from the United States
Postal Service

33:50.931 --> 33:54.135
mail recovery center
and we have been looking

33:54.167 --> 33:56.557
for you for... well,

33:56.591 --> 33:59.329
- a very long time.
- I've been right here.

33:59.361 --> 34:01.468
Yes. We finally figured out
you'd come to Middleton

34:01.500 --> 34:04.926
from a ping we got from a medical
request. Then last night I picked up

34:04.927 --> 34:08.297
a business directory from that woman
at that really interesting shop

34:08.329 --> 34:11.266
- down the street.
- The Bell, Book and Candle?

34:11.300 --> 34:14.702
Right. That's the one. And then when I
found this place was called "Abigail's",

34:14.735 --> 34:17.846
well, I was really hoping
that you were the right one.

34:18.246 --> 34:19.648
The right one?

34:20.960 --> 34:23.045
I'm here to deliver this.

34:25.947 --> 34:28.583
That was mailed twenty years
ago, from out of the country,

34:28.617 --> 34:31.085
and several months ago we found
it behind a sorting machine,

34:31.119 --> 34:35.824
and we've been doing everything we can
to deliver it ever since. And, well,

34:36.266 --> 34:37.893
now we have.

34:38.760 --> 34:42.130
- It's from my father.
- I'm so sorry for the delay.

34:42.164 --> 34:45.098
We just hate when we can't
deliver something on time,

34:45.123 --> 34:46.985
but at least you have it now.

34:54.744 --> 34:56.286
It's London Bridge.

34:58.850 --> 35:02.257
I'm sorry that it's
too many years too late,

35:02.289 --> 35:06.721
but the person that sent that must have
been thinking about you a lot back then.

35:10.691 --> 35:12.553
Yeah, I guess he was.

35:15.431 --> 35:18.633
- Thank you.
- Glad to be of service.

35:30.154 --> 35:31.530
Yes, Sir.

35:32.114 --> 35:34.033
I put it right into her hand.

35:35.743 --> 35:38.387
Well, she seemed surprised.

35:39.747 --> 35:40.822
No,

35:40.855 --> 35:41.902
she didn't say much.

35:41.927 --> 35:44.918
But I could tell your daughter was very
happy to receive it.

35:54.841 --> 35:57.639
You're supposed to have
your elbow up, pointing back.

35:57.673 --> 36:00.709
It doesn't matter where your elbow is,
it matters where your bat is

36:00.742 --> 36:03.778
when you hit the ball. And besides,
I was hitting way more than you.

36:03.811 --> 36:07.048
Yeah, most of those
would have been ground out.

36:15.162 --> 36:18.092
So. It looks like you two
are getting along.

36:18.126 --> 36:20.796
I guess so, yeah.

36:20.829 --> 36:23.231
So I'm glad he and I ran into each other

36:23.264 --> 36:27.068
- at that place.
- Yeah, it worked out.

36:27.101 --> 36:30.038
You know, Nick left New York so fast,

36:30.072 --> 36:32.840
and I was figuring out
how to tell my dad

36:32.873 --> 36:34.942
that it was because of me
he got into trouble...

36:35.761 --> 36:39.715
well, now everybody knows
everything, so it's easier.

36:39.748 --> 36:41.950
And Nick's not so mad at you,

36:41.983 --> 36:45.054
- so maybe you can be friends again?
- I hope so.

36:45.855 --> 36:48.389
And now that things are better,

36:48.774 --> 36:51.126
I was wondering if maybe

36:51.159 --> 36:53.262
you'd want to hang out sometime.

36:53.295 --> 36:57.166
Sure. I mean, I'd like that.

36:58.409 --> 37:01.070
So, we'll figure out a time sometime?

37:01.103 --> 37:02.905
Yeah, we will.

37:18.821 --> 37:20.132
Closing so early?

37:20.165 --> 37:23.002
Yeah, I've got a bit of a drive to make

37:23.035 --> 37:25.337
and some things I need
to pick up for Sam.

37:25.370 --> 37:28.374
Ah, that's why I came by.
To give you an update on his party.

37:28.408 --> 37:31.176
Oh, I hope it hasn't gotten
too complicated, has it?

37:31.210 --> 37:33.780
Well, our plans might be
just a tad extravagant,

37:33.812 --> 37:37.549
but only because Sam deserves
such a large celebration.

37:37.582 --> 37:41.653
Now, I know that everybody is saying
that Sam Radford can never be surprised,

37:41.687 --> 37:46.226
- but I really think we're gonna get him.
- I just want him to feel loved.

37:46.259 --> 37:49.796
And all I want to see is his face when
he sees you standing there and realizes

37:49.828 --> 37:51.302
everything that you've done.

37:51.335 --> 37:54.366
That's gonna make all this
effort worthwhile.

37:54.399 --> 37:57.927
Yeah, he really is
going to be surprised.

38:06.185 --> 38:08.480
- Oh. Hey, Sam.
- Uh, Cassie called

38:08.513 --> 38:11.718
and asked me to come over.
I can't imagine why.

38:11.750 --> 38:13.786
She's around back, I think.

38:13.819 --> 38:16.388
Oh. Where there's room for
a lot more people, of course.

38:16.422 --> 38:18.825
- What?
- I'll go and find her myself.

38:19.323 --> 38:21.826
- Well, you know the way.
- Yes, I do.

38:32.705 --> 38:35.141
Surprise!

38:35.965 --> 38:37.744
Happy anniversary.

38:38.884 --> 38:40.546
What, it's just us?

38:40.580 --> 38:43.315
Oh. Who were you expecting?

38:44.515 --> 38:47.653
Well, I was just sure
you were planning a big party.

38:47.687 --> 38:50.504
So, none of us could
keep that a secret, huh?

38:50.529 --> 38:51.824
So I was right?

38:51.857 --> 38:53.190
You were.

38:53.826 --> 38:54.835
There was this huge guest list

38:54.860 --> 38:56.463
with all these names of people
I didn't know on it.

38:56.495 --> 38:59.598
Then I started thinking what
is it that you really want,

38:59.631 --> 39:04.336
and I remembered one thing about
you is that you hate surprises.

39:05.072 --> 39:07.739
I am really glad you know me so well.

39:07.772 --> 39:10.309
But I hope you don't mind
that I got you a present.

39:10.343 --> 39:12.460
Oh, you can always get me presents.

39:14.295 --> 39:17.182
I saw that picture of you
with your Camaro Z/28...

39:17.216 --> 39:21.221
- How d'you know it was a Z/28?
- I've been studying up.

39:21.719 --> 39:23.623
And I wanted to find something

39:23.656 --> 39:25.598
that would remind you of it, so...

39:28.527 --> 39:32.464
A wooden steering wheel.
Just like in my car.

39:32.497 --> 39:33.954
I'm really sorry
about the ugly paint job,

39:33.979 --> 39:35.634
but that's how I found
it at the scrap yard.

39:35.667 --> 39:39.372
- You went to a scrap yard?
- Yeah, it was kind of fun,

39:39.404 --> 39:41.640
rummaging through that place.
Sort of like browsing my store,

39:41.674 --> 39:43.810
except with greasy metal things.

39:43.843 --> 39:46.368
Yeah. It is kind of like that.

39:47.413 --> 39:51.418
Now you have something to wrap
your hands around, like you wanted.

39:53.419 --> 39:56.288
I love it. Thank you.

39:59.825 --> 40:03.629
- Should we head inside?
- Sure. Yeah.

40:04.178 --> 40:07.400
You know, I actually
wouldn't have minded

40:07.433 --> 40:10.436
- if you had thrown me a party.
- I thought you didn't want one.

40:10.468 --> 40:12.604
It's the act of being
surprised I don't like...

40:12.638 --> 40:15.507
people jumping out and
screaming, "Surprise!" at you.

40:15.540 --> 40:18.877
But since I knew it was coming,
or thought it was coming,

40:18.910 --> 40:22.181
I was prepared for it so it
wouldn't have been so bad.

40:22.214 --> 40:26.185
Well, you have a lot of close friends
who wanted to do something for you.

40:26.218 --> 40:29.388
And I would've liked to have seen
them, since I knew it was coming.

40:29.422 --> 40:32.292
Right. Here.

40:32.325 --> 40:34.083
- Well, thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

40:39.213 --> 40:41.368
And, you got me.

40:44.270 --> 40:47.806
Now, this is the part he hates, so
let's all say it really quietly...

40:47.839 --> 40:50.642
Surprise!

40:50.676 --> 40:53.519
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

40:58.984 --> 41:02.454
- What kind of cake is that?
- Yellow with chocolate frosting.

41:02.488 --> 41:05.825
- Then this really is a party.
- Oh yeah.
