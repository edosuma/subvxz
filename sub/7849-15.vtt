19:50.524 --> 19:51.925
I'M SHORTER HERE.

19:53.293 --> 19:54.361
OH...

19:55.796 --> 19:57.731
GO, BABY, GO!

20:01.435 --> 20:03.670
FOR THE THOUSANDTH TIME,
NO RUNNING IN THE LOBBY.

20:03.737 --> 20:05.305
WE'RE RUNNING
TO HUG YOU.

20:06.106 --> 20:07.774
NO HUGGING IN THE LOBBY.

20:08.942 --> 20:10.644
WE LOVE YOU,
MR. MOSEBY.

20:10.711 --> 20:12.746
YOU'RE SO
WONDERFULLY STRICT.

20:13.213 --> 20:15.649
YES, I AM. NOW LET GO.

20:17.885 --> 20:18.952
VERY WELL.

20:19.753 --> 20:21.655
MADDIE... ARE MY SHOES
BROKEN IN YET?

20:21.722 --> 20:24.057
YES, AND I HAVE
THE BUNIONS TO PROVE IT.

20:24.892 --> 20:27.127
LONDON, WHAT'S
12 TIMES 12?

20:28.295 --> 20:29.329
A MATH QUESTION?

20:29.396 --> 20:30.797
YES! WE'RE BACK!

20:31.431 --> 20:33.033
HOW MANY TIMES
HAVE I TOLD YOU GUYS,

20:33.100 --> 20:34.434
NO CANDY BEFORE DINNER.

20:34.501 --> 20:35.536
Both: MOM!

20:35.602 --> 20:37.471
OK...

20:37.538 --> 20:39.006
I WAS ONLY AT
THE GROCERY STORE

20:39.072 --> 20:40.541
FOR 20 MINUTES.

20:40.607 --> 20:42.009
WOULD'VE BEEN 10,
BUT I COULDN'T DECIDE

20:42.075 --> 20:43.110
BETWEEN ONE PLY OR TWO.

20:44.411 --> 20:46.547
JUST SO YOU KNOW,
TONIGHT WE'LL BE IN BED,

20:46.613 --> 20:48.615
TEETH BRUSHED, BY 7:30.

20:48.682 --> 20:51.218
7:20. TV OFF BY 7:00.

20:51.718 --> 20:52.953
WHAT IS GOING ON?

20:53.587 --> 20:55.422
I KNOW THIS SOUNDS
KIND OF CRAZY,

20:55.489 --> 20:57.491
BUT WE WENT TO
A PARALLEL WORLD,

20:57.558 --> 20:59.426
AND YOU LET US DO
ANYTHING WE WANTED,

20:59.493 --> 21:01.728
AND MOSEBY WAS
POGO STICKING
IN THE LOBBY.

21:01.795 --> 21:03.497
AND YOU WERE IN LOVE
WITH ARWIN.

21:03.564 --> 21:05.866
THAT'S IT. NO MORE SUGARED
BREAKFAST CEREALS.

21:06.366 --> 21:08.735
IT'S TRUE.
AND YOU WERE THERE.

21:08.802 --> 21:09.803
AND YOU.

21:09.870 --> 21:11.371
AND YOU, TOO.

21:11.438 --> 21:12.773
AND THE NUTTIEST
THING OF ALL,

21:12.840 --> 21:14.708
ESTEBAN WAS A WOMAN.

21:14.775 --> 21:15.943
<i>HOLA.</i>

21:16.910 --> 21:18.045
[BOTH SCREAM]

21:22.082 --> 21:23.617
I'M GOING TO
A COSTUME PARTY.

21:23.684 --> 21:25.118
I DID NOT THINK
I LOOKED THAT BAD.

21:31.959 --> 21:33.260
YOU GUYS WANT
SOME PIE FOR DESSERT?

21:33.327 --> 21:34.394
I'VE GOT
APPLE OR CHERRY.

21:34.761 --> 21:36.330
HOW ABOUT SPINACH?

21:36.396 --> 21:40.033
WOW. THAT DREAM MUST'VE
REALLY AFFECTED YOU GUYS.

21:40.100 --> 21:42.035
IT WASN'T A DREAM,
IF IT WAS,

21:42.102 --> 21:44.004
HOW DID WE BOTH
HAVE THE SAME ONE?

21:44.071 --> 21:46.440
WELL, IT'S ACTUALLY
A PRETTY COMMON
THING WITH TWINS.

21:46.507 --> 21:47.741
IT'S CALLED
<i>FALLEZ A DEUX.</i>

21:48.308 --> 21:51.011
SO THAT'S FRENCH FOR,
WE MADE THE WHOLE
THING UP?

21:51.912 --> 21:52.913
THINK ABOUT IT.

21:52.980 --> 21:55.182
A PHONE BOOTH
THAT TAKES YOU
TO A PARALLEL UNIVERSE.

21:55.249 --> 21:56.617
BUNGEE JUMPING
OFF THE BUILDING?

21:56.683 --> 21:58.852
AND THAT ALL SEEMS
PRETTY FARFETCHED.

21:58.919 --> 22:01.555
I GUESS IT WAS
OUR TWIN TELEPATHY AGAIN.

22:02.322 --> 22:04.725
I KNEW YOU WERE
GONNA SAY THAT.

22:06.693 --> 22:09.429
WELL, IT'S 7:28.
WE BETTER GET TO BED.

22:10.197 --> 22:12.533
I SURE HOPE WE DON'T
HAVE THAT DREAM AGAIN.

22:13.333 --> 22:15.002
I'LL BE IN
IN A SECOND, GUYS.

22:19.139 --> 22:20.274
HMM.

22:20.674 --> 22:21.842
GEORGE CLOONEY.

22:22.976 --> 22:24.311
I'LL KEEP THIS ONE.
