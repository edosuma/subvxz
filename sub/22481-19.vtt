WEBVTT

00:01.435 --> 00:04.538
WOMAN: What is wrong
with you? Aah!

00:04.605 --> 00:06.040
MAN: Your own
damn fault!

00:06.107 --> 00:08.676
You want sympathy?
Now you have to make it
look worse than it is.

00:08.742 --> 00:10.311
Nothing to say?

00:10.378 --> 00:12.880
WOMAN:
Screw you!

00:12.946 --> 00:14.948
Stop. I will call
the cops again!

00:33.534 --> 00:35.269
* *

00:42.310 --> 00:43.611
What's that for?

00:43.677 --> 00:44.945
It's to protect us.

00:45.012 --> 00:48.416
But... I... I need
your help, okay?

00:48.482 --> 00:50.184
Stand right over there

00:50.251 --> 00:52.920
and call him
a coward, okay?

00:52.986 --> 00:55.089
No. He'll hurt us.

00:55.156 --> 00:57.325
Not anymore.
Just do it.

00:57.391 --> 00:59.760
Why? I'm scared.

00:59.827 --> 01:01.729
Don't be, baby.

01:01.795 --> 01:04.332
Just trust me, okay?

01:04.398 --> 01:06.100
Now, do it.

01:21.182 --> 01:23.016
You're a coward!

01:23.851 --> 01:25.153
What the hell did you say?

01:25.219 --> 01:28.556
What the hell
did you just say to me?

01:34.828 --> 01:37.131
* *

01:37.198 --> 01:39.333
It's just
you and me now.

01:41.169 --> 01:43.036
Now, listen real close.

01:43.103 --> 01:46.407
All you have to do is
tell them he came at you.

01:46.474 --> 01:47.841
Okay?

01:47.908 --> 01:50.544
Okay, just tell them
he came at you.

01:50.611 --> 01:52.580
And we're both gonna
be okay, Jimmy.

01:52.646 --> 01:55.115
We're both
gonna be okay.

01:56.184 --> 01:58.219
WOMAN: Jimmy?

01:58.286 --> 02:00.554
Hey.
Thanks for coming.

02:00.621 --> 02:01.822
Yeah, of course, Mom.

02:01.889 --> 02:04.158
Everything's still on track
for next week, right?

02:04.225 --> 02:05.259
Well, okay,
here's the thing.

02:05.326 --> 02:06.794
The city housing
and the job

02:06.860 --> 02:09.230
that my parole officer
hooked up for me,

02:09.297 --> 02:10.564
I declined it.

02:10.631 --> 02:11.899
Why?

02:11.965 --> 02:14.602
Because I don't want
to live all the way
in Long Beach.

02:14.668 --> 02:16.970
You know? And... And
work at a food bank.

02:17.037 --> 02:19.373
I want stay with you
and work near you.

02:19.440 --> 02:21.542
You can make that
happen, right?

02:21.609 --> 02:22.710
Yeah. I just...

02:22.776 --> 02:25.145
Sit down for a sec.

02:25.213 --> 02:27.215
I, uh...

02:27.281 --> 02:30.451
I just have one of the guys
staying at my place.

02:30.518 --> 02:32.152
I'd have to kick him out.

02:32.220 --> 02:34.888
Yeah, I'm... I'm sorry.
I know that. I just...

02:34.955 --> 02:37.825
I'm really in a jam.

02:37.891 --> 02:40.561
Jimmy, I really need you
to come through for me,
or they...

02:40.628 --> 02:45.032
They're not gonna
finalize my parole,
and I'll be stuck here.

02:45.098 --> 02:48.936
Honey, after 18 years,
I'm gonna need some help.

02:49.002 --> 02:51.171
Okay. Listen,

02:51.239 --> 02:52.906
don't worry.

02:52.973 --> 02:54.575
I'm gonna take care of it.

02:54.642 --> 02:57.077
We'll get you a gig
somewhere near me,

02:57.144 --> 02:59.447
start you off
on the right foot. Okay?

02:59.513 --> 03:00.614
It's gonna be fine.

03:01.915 --> 03:03.851
Sorry.

03:03.917 --> 03:04.952
It's fine.

03:06.987 --> 03:09.056
I'm really sorry, Ma.
I... I got to go.

03:09.122 --> 03:11.292
I worry about you, sweetie.

03:11.359 --> 03:14.027
Well, I think, for this call,

03:14.094 --> 03:16.264
it's the other guys got
to worry what's coming.

03:17.531 --> 03:19.099
Come here.
Mmm.

03:19.166 --> 03:20.968
I'll tell you more when
we finally get you
out of here.

03:22.002 --> 03:23.704
Love you.
I love you more.

03:25.973 --> 03:28.041
MODERATOR:
A lot of people were surprised

03:28.108 --> 03:30.143
to hear that you
were writing a memoir

03:30.210 --> 03:31.812
at this stage
of your life.

03:31.879 --> 03:33.814
It's not a sign
that you're stopping, is it?

03:33.881 --> 03:36.116
IRINA:
No, not anytime soon.

03:36.183 --> 03:38.752
A lot of people keep asking me
what keeps me motivated...

03:38.819 --> 03:40.621
25-David, your move.

03:40.688 --> 03:41.955
Roger that.

03:42.022 --> 03:45.125
MODERATOR: And wherever
you happen to be living.

03:45.192 --> 03:48.329
IRINA: Doing what I do, I have
to constantly be moving, yes.

03:48.396 --> 03:50.498
Now, The Toll of Truth
is dedicated to all

03:50.564 --> 03:52.633
the brave whistleblowers
you've worked with.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.405
What?

03:59.340 --> 04:00.541
I don't speak Japanese.

04:05.913 --> 04:07.781
Yeah. Neither do I.

04:07.848 --> 04:10.618
I would argue the world needs
brave people more than ever.

04:10.684 --> 04:13.454
And what's your
next big expose
about, Irina?

04:13.521 --> 04:16.857
I wish I knew.
Um, I'm just here getting
some sun in Los Angeles.

04:16.924 --> 04:18.326
Thank you for being
with us today.

04:25.633 --> 04:28.969
26-David, target
is in motion.

04:29.036 --> 04:32.272
Hey, guys, we got some room
service for Irina Zemanova.

04:32.340 --> 04:34.642
She said it should be waiting
for her when she gets back.

04:34.708 --> 04:36.877
Room service?
We know about this?

04:36.944 --> 04:38.812
Back up, into
the elevator.

04:38.879 --> 04:40.047
You heard what the man said.
Let's go.

04:40.113 --> 04:41.649
In the elevator.
No one needs to get hurt.

04:41.715 --> 04:43.584
We're just going
for a little ride.

04:46.720 --> 04:49.122
Thank you so much.

04:49.189 --> 04:50.658
Thank you all for coming.

04:50.724 --> 04:51.759
MAN: Thank you.

04:53.894 --> 04:55.696
30-David, target is
moving up the stairs.

04:55.763 --> 04:57.331
Losing visual.

04:57.398 --> 04:59.199
Accompanied by two bodyguards.
That's her personal detail.

04:59.266 --> 05:00.601
24-David, here we go.

05:04.972 --> 05:07.775
Target's all yours once
we secure the elevator bank.

05:13.781 --> 05:15.783
DEACON: Event security,
ladies and gentlemen.

05:15.849 --> 05:18.251
Authorized personnel only
beyond this point.

05:18.318 --> 05:19.520
IRINA:
What happened to Edgar?

05:19.587 --> 05:21.088
He was supposed
to meet me here.

05:21.154 --> 05:23.256
Yeah, he's not answering
his radio.

05:25.826 --> 05:27.395
Kofi and Denis are gone.

05:27.461 --> 05:29.963
What's going on?
We should take the service
elevators to be safe.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.802
* *

05:56.156 --> 05:57.825
It's you.

06:34.995 --> 06:37.130
Was all that
really necessary?

06:37.197 --> 06:39.399
I tried convincing you last
week before you got here,

06:39.467 --> 06:41.234
but you still thought
your guys
were better than us,

06:41.301 --> 06:43.403
so I had no choice but
to show you that they weren't.

06:43.471 --> 06:45.172
Plus, one of the
guys on your team

06:45.238 --> 06:47.475
just deposited $100,000
in a Swiss bank account,

06:47.541 --> 06:51.144
which makes me wonder
if someone's paying him
to turn on you.

06:51.211 --> 06:52.946
I don't want your help.

06:53.013 --> 06:55.015
We managed just fine
in Rio and in Bruges.

06:55.082 --> 06:58.486
You got lucky in Rio,
and people still got hurt.

06:58.552 --> 07:01.321
Whoever's coming after you
doesn't give a damn
about collateral damage.

07:01.388 --> 07:03.991
And since you're here
in Los Angeles
for the next 37 hours,

07:04.057 --> 07:07.628
the mayor's made it my job
to keep you
and this city safe until then.

07:07.695 --> 07:09.530
What exactly has
the CIA told you?

07:09.597 --> 07:13.233
They can't operate within
U.S. borders, so they have
local police do the job.

07:13.300 --> 07:14.902
What do they say?
I've been told

07:14.968 --> 07:17.471
there could be an attempt on
your life here in Los Angeles.

07:17.538 --> 07:19.607
You know, maybe pissing off
oligarchs, money launderers,

07:19.673 --> 07:20.874
and drug kingpins
by publishing

07:20.941 --> 07:22.543
their dirty little secrets
has its drawbacks.

07:22.610 --> 07:26.480
Maybe I enjoy getting under
the skin of powerful men.

07:26.547 --> 07:28.682
You know, I give you props
for your bravery. I do.

07:28.749 --> 07:30.818
But right now,
you're my problem.

07:30.884 --> 07:32.853
So why don't you just let us
stash you at S.W.A.T. HQ

07:32.920 --> 07:35.823
until your plane
takes off tomorrow?
No, thanks.

07:35.889 --> 07:38.225
Where I come from, the cops
are worse than the criminals.

07:38.291 --> 07:41.094
I understand that mentality,
but we're not where
you come from.

07:42.763 --> 07:44.632
If I agree to
your protection,

07:44.698 --> 07:46.934
freedom of movement laws say
you have to accompany me,

07:47.000 --> 07:48.468
not the other way
around, right?

07:48.536 --> 07:51.839
I have to meet a source
for a story, privately.

07:51.905 --> 07:54.074
You said onstage you're
just here to get some sun.

07:54.141 --> 07:55.142
Well, I guess
I lied, didn't I?

07:55.943 --> 07:57.010
Where's this meeting?

07:57.077 --> 07:58.411
In the cafe
downstairs.

07:58.478 --> 08:01.081
And I can't have you and
your army scaring him off.

08:01.148 --> 08:02.950
Okay, I'll tell you what,

08:03.016 --> 08:04.818
you cooperate with us

08:04.885 --> 08:07.721
and I'll put on
my friendly face.

08:07.788 --> 08:10.524
Luca, I got to talk
to you about something.

08:10.591 --> 08:12.292
Look, if it has to do
with eating your leftovers,

08:12.359 --> 08:14.595
don't worry, I was gonna
go out and buy some
ground beef today.

08:14.662 --> 08:16.129
No, it's...

08:16.196 --> 08:18.832
I actually need you to find
another place to stay, man.

08:18.899 --> 08:21.535
For real? Nah,
you're just messing with me.

08:21.602 --> 08:22.936
I'm not.

08:23.003 --> 08:24.838
I need you out by
the end of the week.

08:24.905 --> 08:26.540
This week?

08:26.607 --> 08:29.242
Dude, you're the one
who took me in when
I needed a place.

08:29.309 --> 08:31.078
Talk about short notice.

08:31.144 --> 08:34.447
So, what, your girlfriends can
kick you out with no warning,
but not me?

08:34.514 --> 08:36.149
That's a low blow, man.

08:36.216 --> 08:38.686
You're bringing up a lot
of relationship pain for me.

08:38.752 --> 08:40.954
I'm sorry. It's just...

08:41.021 --> 08:43.156
Man, it's been six months.

08:43.223 --> 08:44.925
I thought
you crashing was,

08:44.992 --> 08:47.561
like, temporary
until you found a place.

08:47.628 --> 08:49.462
But we haven't even finished
our Call of Duty campaign.

08:49.529 --> 08:52.065
Are we just gonna leave it
at 56% complete?

08:52.132 --> 08:54.735
All right. Straight up...

08:54.802 --> 08:56.737
I need
the place for my mom.

08:56.804 --> 08:58.171
She's getting
paroled next week,

08:58.238 --> 08:59.807
and I got to
make space for her.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.141
I hear you. Got you.

09:01.208 --> 09:02.610
Family comes first.

09:02.676 --> 09:03.877
Thanks, man. I...

09:03.944 --> 09:05.312
All clear up ahead, Hondo.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.781
...appreciate
you understanding.

09:07.848 --> 09:09.549
How do you communicate
with this source?

09:09.617 --> 09:11.484
With a Linux terminal
on a secure Nmap.

09:11.551 --> 09:12.953
And a burner phone.

09:13.020 --> 09:14.888
So there's no way
for anyone to track you?

09:14.955 --> 09:17.090
I know how dangerous
mistakes are.

09:17.157 --> 09:19.259
My fiance was killed three
years ago because of a story

09:19.326 --> 09:20.761
we were working on
together in Minsk.

09:20.828 --> 09:22.896
I get it, Hondo.
Okay, okay, okay.

09:22.963 --> 09:24.598
I heard about that.

09:24.665 --> 09:27.300
But that's why you need
to trust me to do whatever
it takes to keep you safe.

09:27.367 --> 09:29.937
The man who shot him
was a mole working
for the government,

09:30.003 --> 09:31.972
telling me the same things
you're telling me now.

09:32.039 --> 09:33.506
That is not gonna
happen here, Irina.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.075
You have my word.

09:36.243 --> 09:38.045
Okay, Hondo.

09:38.111 --> 09:40.313
I'm willing to trust you.

09:40.380 --> 09:41.782
I'll cooperate.
Good.

09:41.849 --> 09:44.317
All right, listen,
we're gonna be rotating
two three-man teams,

09:44.384 --> 09:46.153
day and night,
for the next

09:46.219 --> 09:47.955
36 hours and 14 minutes,

09:48.021 --> 09:49.589
when I can put you
on your plane myself.

09:52.092 --> 09:53.326
What's your source look like?

09:53.393 --> 09:54.695
IRINA: I don't know.
Never met him before.

09:54.762 --> 09:56.396
Online, he goes by Shaolin.

09:56.463 --> 09:57.831
HONDO: And you trust him?

09:57.898 --> 10:00.000
Whistleblowers risk more
than the journalists
protecting them.

10:00.067 --> 10:02.435
The important thing
is that he trusts me.

10:03.737 --> 10:06.039
Luca, take the left side.
Street and I got the right.

10:07.574 --> 10:09.843
So, I hear you're
finally kicking Luca out.

10:09.910 --> 10:12.212
Well, it's been six months.
Think I've done my time.

10:14.081 --> 10:16.717
I heard your mom's
getting paroled, too.

10:16.784 --> 10:18.351
Street,

10:18.418 --> 10:20.954
are you sure you don't want
to maintain a little distance?

10:21.021 --> 10:22.756
I mean,
just to start?

10:22.823 --> 10:24.591
I hope your mom
can turn things around and
I'm not saying she can't...

10:24.658 --> 10:27.027
I don't really
have a choice here.

10:27.094 --> 10:28.796
I'm the only family she's got.

10:28.862 --> 10:29.963
Hondo,

10:30.030 --> 10:31.699
I got it under control.

10:31.765 --> 10:33.867
Street, I got to say it.
I think her living with you
is a bad idea.

10:33.934 --> 10:36.403
What, 'cause you still think
that she filed that misconduct
charge against you?

10:36.469 --> 10:38.038
I explained that.

10:38.105 --> 10:40.073
That was just
some other woman in prison
trying to impress her.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.441
She had no idea.

10:41.508 --> 10:44.144
So, look, either
I help her out,
or she stays locked up.

10:44.211 --> 10:45.378
And I can't have that.

10:45.445 --> 10:47.681
Street, I love my mom,
too, so I understand.

10:47.748 --> 10:49.850
I just don't want this
impacting you or S.W.A.T.

10:49.917 --> 10:51.819
It won't.

10:51.885 --> 10:54.221
I got friends I can call.

10:54.287 --> 10:57.090
We can pull some strings
and get her in a good
halfway house in Reseda.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.458
That'll give her
the space she needs

10:58.525 --> 11:00.227
to find herself,
solidify parole

11:00.293 --> 11:01.695
and give you peace of mind.

11:03.764 --> 11:05.332
Let me give it
some thought, okay?

11:06.934 --> 11:07.968
HONDO: All right.

11:08.035 --> 11:09.469
Hold up, hold up.
Where's she going?

11:09.536 --> 11:10.738
Where's she going?
She's on the move.

11:10.804 --> 11:12.205
Luca, she's on the move.

11:12.272 --> 11:13.640
LUCA: Excuse me,
excuse me. Excuse me.
Out of the way.

11:15.075 --> 11:17.610
Excuse us. Move, move, move.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.279
Excuse me, excuse me.
HONDO: Move aside. L.A.P.D.

11:19.346 --> 11:20.781
Move, move, move.

11:20.848 --> 11:23.116
LUCA: Door's locked.
She's gone.

11:23.183 --> 11:24.918
She planned it.

11:24.985 --> 11:27.354
I figured she might
pull a stunt like this,
so I had this pre-loaded.

11:33.460 --> 11:34.795
You see her?

11:34.862 --> 11:36.797
HONDO:
Right there. Right there.
Outdoor cafe.

12:06.726 --> 12:08.028
* *

12:18.405 --> 12:19.773
Police! Everybody down!

12:21.708 --> 12:23.510
Stay down.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.178
Stay down!

12:27.347 --> 12:28.548
Get up! Up.

12:28.615 --> 12:29.716
On the ground.

12:41.261 --> 12:42.896
Oh!

12:42.963 --> 12:44.097
STREET: Miss, come
here! Come here!

12:45.799 --> 12:47.267
Get out of the car!
HONDO: Move!

12:47.334 --> 12:48.501
Move!
Get out!

12:48.568 --> 12:50.203
Get out!

13:01.815 --> 13:04.284
You okay

13:04.351 --> 13:07.154
This is 20-David to Control.
I need an R/A at location.

13:07.220 --> 13:10.157
I got two victims
with injuries, one
suspect in custody.

13:10.223 --> 13:14.694
Be advised, another suspect
last seen in a dark green Jeep
headed west on Hewitt.

13:14.761 --> 13:16.463
All right, sit down.
Sit down. Sit tight.

13:16.529 --> 13:18.698
Help's on the way, okay?
Okay.

13:18.765 --> 13:20.600
This is all on you.

13:20.667 --> 13:22.202
I can explain.
Oh, and you will.

13:22.269 --> 13:24.004
Back at S.W.A.T. headquarters.

13:24.071 --> 13:25.505
You just made yourself
a witness to a crime,

13:25.572 --> 13:27.074
so now I decide
where you go.

13:27.140 --> 13:28.308
You made your play.

13:28.375 --> 13:29.476
Now I'm gonna make mine.

13:36.783 --> 13:41.554
The mayor's curious
how a public cafe was shot up
with two civilians injured.

13:41.621 --> 13:42.789
In case you're wondering, yes,

13:42.856 --> 13:45.192
she did say the word "curious"
sarcastically.

13:45.258 --> 13:46.626
She wants things locked down.

13:46.693 --> 13:49.229
Tell the mayor I'm
the one to blame
for Irina slipping away.

13:49.296 --> 13:50.563
That's not the way
it works, Hondo.

13:50.630 --> 13:51.932
We all take responsibility.

13:51.999 --> 13:53.733
But we can't let anything else
happen to Irina

13:53.800 --> 13:56.069
or have any other
collateral damage.

13:56.136 --> 13:58.371
We don't wait
for these shooters
to attack again.

13:58.438 --> 14:00.040
We need to track
them down first.

14:00.107 --> 14:01.641
We're canvassing
security cameras,

14:01.708 --> 14:03.877
trying to find the stolen Jeep
the other suspect stole.

14:03.944 --> 14:06.079
The guy we have in custody
might be able to help us
ID him.

14:06.146 --> 14:09.116
Well, so far he isn't talking,
and Irina's keeping quiet,
too.

14:09.182 --> 14:10.650
I'm gonna get
answers. Trust me.

14:12.285 --> 14:15.956
The people who are hurt,
are they going to be okay?

14:16.023 --> 14:18.992
What, you mean the two women
in the ER right now?

14:19.059 --> 14:20.393
Yeah, they'll live.

14:20.460 --> 14:21.962
But you pretty much ruined
their week.

14:22.029 --> 14:25.232
I thought we were
on the road
to trusting each other.

14:25.298 --> 14:26.499
Guess you lied
about that, too.

14:26.566 --> 14:28.801
My source would have panicked
if he saw you all there.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.470
I had to go alone.

14:30.537 --> 14:32.439
I have to leave here.

14:32.505 --> 14:33.941
Try another one, lady.

14:34.007 --> 14:36.076
You want me
to tell the whole world
you put a foreign journalist

14:36.143 --> 14:37.410
under house arrest?

14:37.477 --> 14:39.246
I thought this was L.A.,
not Moscow.

14:39.312 --> 14:40.747
Local laws
say I can keep you here

14:40.813 --> 14:42.315
for 12 hours
as a material witness.

14:42.382 --> 14:44.952
That's the new plan.
Get used to it.

14:45.018 --> 14:47.387
You're no different
than the other police.

14:47.454 --> 14:48.989
Using guns to get your way.

14:49.056 --> 14:52.993
The difference is,
I'm trying to keep you alive.

14:53.060 --> 14:54.861
This Russian cat
we have in custody,

14:54.928 --> 14:56.696
he's got no records,
no history.

14:56.763 --> 14:58.298
He's a ghost.

14:58.365 --> 15:00.267
So what's he doing, Irina?

15:00.333 --> 15:02.335
Is he here trying to kill you
for something
you've already written

15:02.402 --> 15:04.871
or something
you're about to write?

15:04.938 --> 15:07.007
What is this story
that you're working on?

15:07.074 --> 15:08.408
I can't tell you.

15:08.475 --> 15:11.244
I have to protect my source
until I publish it.

15:11.311 --> 15:15.348
Okay, fine. Fine, then you're
gonna sit right here.

15:15.415 --> 15:17.250
Let me know if you need
a book to read or something.

15:20.553 --> 15:23.223
I've been working
for the last nine months
on a story

15:23.290 --> 15:25.492
about some
very powerful people
from Russia

15:25.558 --> 15:27.127
who are trying to smuggle
machine guns

15:27.194 --> 15:29.362
and fully automatic
rifles into the U.S.

15:36.703 --> 15:38.005
Why?

15:38.071 --> 15:39.206
Why

15:39.272 --> 15:40.540
Money?
No.

15:40.607 --> 15:42.175
They want to dump
them here for free.

15:42.242 --> 15:44.077
They want Americans
killing each other

15:44.144 --> 15:47.847
like people did
in Ukraine, Georgia,
Syria.

15:47.914 --> 15:51.051
They plan to start
in Los Angeles,
then other big cities.

15:51.118 --> 15:53.086
Over 50,000 assault weapons.

15:53.153 --> 15:55.888
The first shipments
are already on their way.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.690
Do you know how
they're moving them here?

15:57.757 --> 16:01.094
No. I need to get
to my source to get
the information.

16:01.161 --> 16:03.863
Look, the first meeting
was to build trust.

16:03.930 --> 16:06.033
If I don't meet
with Shaolin today,

16:06.099 --> 16:08.001
he'll get scared and
go back into hiding.

16:08.068 --> 16:10.903
And then we'll never find out
how these guns
are being moved here.

16:14.274 --> 16:16.676
I tried a little Russian
in Google Translate,

16:16.743 --> 16:18.045
but he still hasn't bitten.

16:18.111 --> 16:19.312
He definitely
understands English.

16:19.379 --> 16:21.181
Every time I say the words,
"You suck at your job..."

16:22.149 --> 16:23.383
See? He twitches.

16:23.450 --> 16:25.518
Engraving in Cyrillic
on his ring means "Pavel."

16:25.585 --> 16:26.653
I guess it's his name.

16:28.121 --> 16:31.424
If you're a foreign spy
or wanted by Interpol,

16:31.491 --> 16:34.261
you'll be looking
at federal prison for life,

16:34.327 --> 16:38.098
unless you start talking
and tell us who hired you.

16:38.165 --> 16:40.533
Or we can hand you over
to the CIA.

16:40.600 --> 16:41.934
Let them deal with you.

16:44.571 --> 16:46.439
What isn't the CIA
telling us, Agent Bishop?

16:46.506 --> 16:49.076
We told you there
might be a hit on your
journalist here in L.A.

16:49.142 --> 16:50.743
That's all we're
at liberty to say.

16:50.810 --> 16:52.045
For deniability, fine.

16:52.112 --> 16:54.547
But why isn't
Homeland Security
or the FBI involved?

16:54.614 --> 16:56.883
Because now I know
this is bigger
than you led us to believe.

16:56.949 --> 16:58.951
The same Russians who
tried to kill Irina

16:59.018 --> 17:00.987
in Rio and Bruges are
coming after her here.

17:01.054 --> 17:03.290
A lot of chatter
is telling us the Russians

17:03.356 --> 17:05.092
are pulling out all
the stops this time.

17:05.158 --> 17:07.627
Maybe that has something
to do with whatever story
she's working on.

17:07.694 --> 17:08.861
Do you know anything
about guns

17:08.928 --> 17:10.997
being smuggled
into the country?
No.

17:11.064 --> 17:12.932
We think our suspect
in custody

17:12.999 --> 17:15.001
is a professional
Russian mercenary.

17:15.068 --> 17:17.970
No files on him anywhere,
but we think his name
is Pavel.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.639
What makes you say that?

17:19.706 --> 17:21.941
The engraving on his ring.

17:22.008 --> 17:24.877
Does he wear it on
his right thumb?
Yeah.

17:24.944 --> 17:25.945
Does that mean something?

17:26.012 --> 17:28.014
Means Pavel's
the name of his handler.

17:28.081 --> 17:31.284
That ring is a membership band
for a bathhouse in Mid-City.

17:31.351 --> 17:32.652
But he's not
Russian intelligence,

17:32.719 --> 17:34.454
or you could have
picked him up.

17:34.521 --> 17:36.989
All right, now that we're
out in the open about this,
you should know.

17:37.056 --> 17:40.026
There's a nest here
in L.A. of ex-KGB agents

17:40.093 --> 17:43.296
who have strong connections
with Russian oligarchs
and weapons dealers.

17:43.363 --> 17:46.266
That bathhouse is probably
a place where the guy
you got in custody

17:46.333 --> 17:47.734
and others like him meet
with their handler.

17:47.800 --> 17:49.202
Now, we've been
casing them for years,

17:49.269 --> 17:51.671
but never gotten
enough evidence
to make any arrests.

17:51.738 --> 17:53.506
Now, with his mercs
going after Irina,

17:53.573 --> 17:55.375
maybe you can help us out
in that department.

17:55.442 --> 17:57.277
Because S.W.A.T.
going after him
makes it appear

17:57.344 --> 17:59.512
like a local crime,
giving the CIA cover.

17:59.579 --> 18:02.349
Listen, fact is, you getting
evidence on their handler

18:02.415 --> 18:04.451
gives you the Russians
trying to kill Irina.

18:07.820 --> 18:09.822
Hey.
Hey.

18:09.889 --> 18:12.625
You know why, uh, Cortez
ordered us into civvies?

18:12.692 --> 18:13.993
Not yet.

18:16.062 --> 18:17.197
I, um...

18:17.264 --> 18:19.031
I heard you kicked Luca
out of your place.

18:19.098 --> 18:22.135
I know your mom's
getting paroled.

18:22.202 --> 18:24.204
There's got to be a lot
weighing on you, Street.

18:24.271 --> 18:26.706
It's nothing
I can't handle.
Right.

18:26.773 --> 18:29.776
'Cause you remember
when we both got reprimanded
when you went off-case

18:29.842 --> 18:32.979
and you beat up that dude
for her? 'Cause I do.

18:33.045 --> 18:36.383
Look, someone getting out
of jail seems straightforward,

18:36.449 --> 18:38.318
but it changes your life, too.

18:39.552 --> 18:41.188
I can keep trouble away
from my mom.

18:41.254 --> 18:45.124
I got you, but will she keep
trouble away from you?

18:49.128 --> 18:53.366
Hey, guys. Short notice,
I know, but, uh,
I need a place to stay.

18:53.433 --> 18:55.668
Street kicked me out.
Any takers?

18:55.735 --> 18:57.970
Well, you know I got
three kids, but, uh, yeah.

18:58.037 --> 18:59.272
If you want to
share a bedroom

18:59.339 --> 19:01.608
with a colicky baby,
be my guest.
I'm open to it.

19:01.674 --> 19:03.243
I'll have to ask Annie.

19:03.310 --> 19:04.411
What about you?

19:04.477 --> 19:06.446
Uh, no.
Bonnie would hate me.

19:06.513 --> 19:07.847
Who's Bonnie?

19:07.914 --> 19:09.382
The girl I've been dating.
I've mentioned her.

19:09.449 --> 19:11.050
She kind of stays
at my place now.

19:11.117 --> 19:13.820
Sort of getting serious.
Sorry, man.

19:13.886 --> 19:15.922
All right, I'll figure
something else out, thanks.

19:17.324 --> 19:18.625
If we don't find that guy
a place to live,

19:18.691 --> 19:19.926
he's gonna home-invade
one of us.

19:19.992 --> 19:21.528
Tell me about it.

19:21.594 --> 19:22.762
According to the CIA,

19:22.829 --> 19:24.764
our shooter's handler
is Pavel Nobokov,

19:24.831 --> 19:26.165
AKA "Melvin Norwood."

19:26.233 --> 19:27.867
The data files in his
air-gapped laptop

19:27.934 --> 19:29.636
should hopefully get us
to the other shooters

19:29.702 --> 19:32.405
going after Irina,
and the money men trying
to smuggle guns into L.A.

19:32.472 --> 19:35.107
Now, sealed warrant depends on
us downloading his hard drive

19:35.174 --> 19:37.310
and getting out clean.
No margin for error.

19:37.377 --> 19:39.579
So if we get caught, it's
an international incident,
I'm guessing.

19:39.646 --> 19:41.414
Pissed off congressmen,
a lot of people screaming?

19:41.481 --> 19:43.149
I'd really hate to
disappoint a politician,

19:43.216 --> 19:45.618
but our main concern
is ex-KGB agents,
who are going to be on-site.

19:45.685 --> 19:48.588
And these guys are pros,
so we need to go in stealth.

19:48.655 --> 19:50.323
Hence the civvies.
Yeah.

19:50.390 --> 19:52.225
That's, like, a real outfit
you're proud to wear, Street?

19:52.292 --> 19:53.960
I don't have time to explain
style to you, Tan.

19:54.026 --> 19:55.495
I'm assuming that
going in there

19:55.562 --> 19:57.129
and distracting the
target's my job, right?

19:57.196 --> 19:59.466
Actually, no.
Membership's men only.

19:59.532 --> 20:01.368
Typically, the strong
and silent type, so...

20:03.169 --> 20:05.738
Time to get your
sneak on, Deac.

20:16.949 --> 20:18.050
Good afternoon.

20:18.117 --> 20:19.185
Uh, welcome.

20:20.653 --> 20:21.954
Uh, write your name, please.

20:24.123 --> 20:25.492
We're in.

20:30.830 --> 20:32.231
He's with me.

20:47.514 --> 20:48.815
STREET: All right,
locker room's empty

20:48.881 --> 20:50.317
and the receptionist
is double checking.

20:50.383 --> 20:53.085
I'm cutting the power now.
CHRIS: Uh-oh.

20:53.152 --> 20:54.621
Hope no one's in the middle
of drying their hair.

21:05.932 --> 21:08.267
Okay, four minutes until
DWP reroutes power

21:08.335 --> 21:09.469
to the backup
circuit breaker.

21:09.536 --> 21:11.270
Should be enough time
to download the files,

21:11.338 --> 21:14.140
assuming you can keep
the target engaged.

21:14.206 --> 21:16.175
All right, target last seen
in the sauna room.

21:16.242 --> 21:18.378
Hondo, the receptionist
is heading your way.

21:20.547 --> 21:21.914
What's going on
with the power?

21:21.981 --> 21:24.050
We've got rolling blackouts,
miss, I'm sorry.

21:24.116 --> 21:25.652
We're doing the best we can.

21:25.718 --> 21:27.687
It might be a little quicker
if we could get to your
fuse box.

21:27.754 --> 21:29.356
It's in the
back hallway.

21:29.422 --> 21:31.057
Okay, I'll be there
in a second. Thank you.

21:32.825 --> 21:33.993
Tan.

21:39.432 --> 21:41.668
You can tell your clients
it'll be about five minutes
or ten.

21:41.734 --> 21:42.869
No more than ten.

21:42.935 --> 21:44.437
I'll let you know
if I need 15.

21:51.644 --> 21:52.712
Street. We've got eyes again.

21:52.779 --> 21:54.614
STREET: All right,
we're back in business.

21:56.248 --> 21:57.450
I got it.

22:06.292 --> 22:07.827
Whew!

22:11.964 --> 22:13.900
STREET:
Deacon's in the sauna
with the target.

22:13.966 --> 22:15.001
Luca, you're clear. Move in.

22:18.438 --> 22:20.807
You're looking for Norwood.

22:20.873 --> 22:22.308
You got approximately
two minutes.

22:23.976 --> 22:27.714
That's some great ink.
Tell me you know an artist
on the west side.

22:27.780 --> 22:31.150
Of Moscow, yes.

22:34.454 --> 22:36.889
Do I know you?
No. I usually come mornings.

22:37.590 --> 22:39.291
Me, too.

22:39.358 --> 22:40.827
This is late for me.

22:43.463 --> 22:45.264
LUCA:
All right, I'm starting
the download now.

22:45.331 --> 22:46.966
Looks like we've got info
on Melvin's shooters

22:47.033 --> 22:48.668
and a whole lot more.

22:48.735 --> 22:50.570
HONDO: You got two minutes
till power changeover.

22:50.637 --> 22:51.904
I'm gonna need more time.

22:51.971 --> 22:53.973
I can hold
the circuit breakers
for the building, Luca,

22:54.040 --> 22:55.542
but the rest of the block
will be online.

22:55.608 --> 22:56.909
I'm going as fast as I can.

22:59.446 --> 23:01.047
CHRIS: The block's
coming back on now.

23:08.320 --> 23:09.388
The receptionist
is clocking it.

23:11.658 --> 23:13.660
Just stay the course.
You hear me? Stay the course.

23:15.094 --> 23:17.029
LUCA:
Okay, we've got 30%
and counting.

23:17.497 --> 23:18.598
Hey.

23:18.665 --> 23:20.399
You're, uh,
Melvin, right?

23:20.467 --> 23:22.234
Yes.

23:22.301 --> 23:24.771
Now, who's asking?
Who are you?

23:24.837 --> 23:25.838
Just a friend of a friend.

23:25.905 --> 23:27.006
Yeah?

23:29.241 --> 23:30.710
Where did you get this ring?

23:31.744 --> 23:33.980
You got to earn it,
don't you?

23:34.046 --> 23:37.817
The rest of the
block has power, why not here?
What's going on?

23:37.884 --> 23:39.218
I still need to reset
your fuses, ma'am.

23:40.252 --> 23:41.420
We're close.

23:49.095 --> 23:50.930
There we go.

23:53.900 --> 23:55.635
They got eyes on you, Luca.

23:55.702 --> 23:56.869
I'm only at 60%.

24:06.779 --> 24:08.615
If you could just sign
right here, please.

24:09.882 --> 24:11.283
Done.

24:14.220 --> 24:15.922
Thank you for
your patience.

24:19.759 --> 24:21.193
You know my name,

24:21.260 --> 24:23.329
but I never gave
you that ring.

24:23.395 --> 24:24.564
Tell me your name.

24:25.164 --> 24:26.533
Dmitri.

24:26.599 --> 24:27.834
STREET:
Deacon, Luca's clear.
Get out of there.

24:27.900 --> 24:29.168
I'll be right back.

24:41.814 --> 24:43.883
(RECEPTIONIST AND GUARD
SPEAKING RUSSIAN)

25:11.343 --> 25:14.146
KAREN: You okay?
STREET: Mmm-hmm.

25:14.213 --> 25:16.448
Your boss okay with you,
you know, stepping away?

25:16.515 --> 25:17.950
Yeah, yeah.

25:18.017 --> 25:22.288
We're rotating teams
and our VIP's back
at HQ, so it's fine.

25:22.354 --> 25:25.558
Jimmy, I am literally
counting the minutes.

25:25.625 --> 25:27.894
I mean, you'd think
after 18 years

25:27.960 --> 25:29.596
that a few more days
would be easy,

25:29.662 --> 25:31.564
but I've never felt
this on edge.

25:31.631 --> 25:34.333
Yeah. Same here, Mom.

25:34.400 --> 25:36.235
And you... You know, I...

25:36.302 --> 25:38.705
I did want to ask you
if you wanted something

25:38.771 --> 25:42.609
more spacious than just
my living room couch.

25:42.675 --> 25:44.977
One of my colleagues
can pull strings

25:45.044 --> 25:47.614
at some good
sponsored housing in Reseda.

25:47.680 --> 25:49.248
A halfway house, Jimmy.

25:49.315 --> 25:53.152
Well, it's a residence
where there is
a caretaker person

25:53.219 --> 25:55.421
and there's support groups
to help with the transition.

25:55.487 --> 25:56.923
It's a halfway house.

25:56.989 --> 25:59.158
I mean, am I half
your mother?

25:59.225 --> 26:03.162
No, it's just,
it's actually closer

26:03.229 --> 26:06.666
to the job that I'm trying
to get lined up for you.

26:06.733 --> 26:08.968
And this way you'd have
the space you need.

26:09.035 --> 26:13.105
What I need is
to be with my son.

26:13.172 --> 26:15.174
That's what's
gonna help me.

26:16.275 --> 26:18.811
I know.

26:18.878 --> 26:20.379
You're right.

26:20.446 --> 26:22.348
Do you not trust me
out there, Jimmy?

26:22.414 --> 26:24.316
Of course I do, Ma.

26:24.383 --> 26:26.619
What'd we find?
Melvin sent
encrypted text messages

26:26.686 --> 26:28.354
to these four numbers

26:28.420 --> 26:29.989
within minutes
of the attack on Irina.

26:30.056 --> 26:32.959
One of the burner phones
belongs to the guy
you currently have in custody.

26:33.025 --> 26:35.227
Let me guess,
the other one belongs
to the shooter who escaped.

26:35.294 --> 26:36.929
Yep. And the other
two burners probably belong

26:36.996 --> 26:38.430
to a pair of backup shooters.

26:38.497 --> 26:40.199
Now, I've triangulated
the last known
cell phone pings

26:40.266 --> 26:41.801
to see if we can
get a location.

26:41.868 --> 26:43.936
So there's three men
trying to kill me?

26:44.003 --> 26:46.205
Looks like I'm barking
up the right tree.

26:46.272 --> 26:48.875
Don't worry, they can't get
to you as long you're here.

26:48.941 --> 26:51.878
The problem is, Irina has
a speaking engagement tonight
and she can't miss it.

26:51.944 --> 26:55.147
After the speech, her source
is gonna hand out the
final pieces of information

26:55.214 --> 26:56.983
about the guns
headed to L.A.
No.

26:57.049 --> 26:59.318
Too risky. Irina is
a walking target.

26:59.385 --> 27:01.553
As long as those three
shooters are out there,

27:01.620 --> 27:03.055
everyone around her
is in danger.

27:03.122 --> 27:05.725
Your source can give you
that information when
you're out of L.A.

27:05.792 --> 27:08.560
Captain, if Irina's right
about the assault weapons
coming in,

27:08.627 --> 27:10.162
we don't have
that kind of time.

27:10.229 --> 27:12.531
These guns weren't
on the State Department
radar until now.

27:12.598 --> 27:14.400
The intel looks like
it checks out so far.

27:14.466 --> 27:16.903
Intercepting these weapons
would be huge.

27:16.969 --> 27:18.871
By the time I leave town,
it'll be too late.

27:18.938 --> 27:20.339
BISHOP: Got a ping.

27:20.406 --> 27:22.274
One of our
three burner phones.

27:22.341 --> 27:26.545
All right. Near an industrial
section of Huntington Park,
east of Hope Street.

27:26.612 --> 27:28.414
There's only one
apartment complex nearby.

27:28.480 --> 27:30.683
Tenants.
All with Hispanic names,

27:30.750 --> 27:32.919
except one, Yuri Chernon.

27:32.985 --> 27:35.587
How do you want to do this?
I'll split up my team.

27:35.654 --> 27:37.456
I'll have Deacon and Luca
no-knock the apartment,

27:37.523 --> 27:39.692
and we'll take Rocker
and couple of Mumford's guys

27:39.759 --> 27:41.360
to the event
with Irina.

27:41.427 --> 27:45.264
Get them
tac'd up and ready.
I'm going with you.

27:45.331 --> 27:47.466
If we're gonna risk
getting fired,
I'm gonna be there.

27:49.368 --> 27:52.839
One bedroom,
Mar Vista, third floor,
newly carpeted.

27:52.905 --> 27:54.874
Nah, it's not west-facing.

27:54.941 --> 27:57.376
I need to see
the sunset.
It soothes me.

27:57.443 --> 27:59.879
All right, well, what about
a deluxe studio in Culver City

27:59.946 --> 28:01.948
one block
from downtown?

28:02.014 --> 28:04.450
Fake marble...
That's an HGTV no-no.

28:04.516 --> 28:06.518
Okay. Okay, Luca,
we got you.

28:08.487 --> 28:09.655
Here we go.
One-bedroom loft,

28:09.722 --> 28:11.891
fourth floor,
Hollywood and La Brea,

28:11.958 --> 28:13.392
real marble,
west-facing,

28:13.459 --> 28:15.294
and the kicker is...
Fully furnished,

28:15.361 --> 28:17.629
ready to move in this week.
Boom, son.

28:17.696 --> 28:18.965
I don't know, guys.

28:19.031 --> 28:21.200
Look, if it sounds
too good to be true,
it probably is.

28:21.267 --> 28:22.534
Thanks for trying, though.

28:25.204 --> 28:27.473
What's the deal?
It's got everything he wants.

28:27.539 --> 28:30.743
Luca's a guy who's got
long-term monogamous
relationships that end.

28:30.810 --> 28:34.246
But then he's eventually
bunking with one of us
until he meets a new girl.

28:34.313 --> 28:35.414
And then we're always
telling him

28:35.481 --> 28:37.616
he's moving in
too early, right?

28:37.683 --> 28:38.951
Well, this is
a guy who knows

28:39.018 --> 28:40.820
no place is ever
gonna be good enough,

28:40.887 --> 28:42.621
because he'd have
to be there by himself.

28:42.688 --> 28:44.456
Doesn't want to live alone.
Sounds right.

28:44.523 --> 28:46.592
DEACON:
So what do you suggest
we do about it?

28:47.760 --> 28:49.328
CHRIS:
Time to go, Street.

28:49.395 --> 28:51.430
You need help
getting ready or something?

28:51.497 --> 28:53.032
No, I don't need help
getting ready.

28:53.099 --> 28:56.068
But if you could help
Luca find a place,
that'd be amazing.

28:56.135 --> 28:58.137
Yeah, I'm... I'm
working on that.

29:03.442 --> 29:05.644
I know you got mixed feelings
about your mom,

29:05.711 --> 29:07.513
but just because
she's your mom

29:07.579 --> 29:09.248
doesn't mean you
have to put yourself out.

29:11.050 --> 29:13.319
What if I'm the reason
my mom's in prison?

29:13.385 --> 29:14.821
Your mother
killed your father.
No.

29:14.887 --> 29:16.255
That's why she's in prison.

29:16.322 --> 29:19.491
No, my father was on track
to kill both of us.

29:19.558 --> 29:20.827
Eventually.

29:20.893 --> 29:24.263
But my mom just...

29:24.330 --> 29:26.298
She just stopped him
from getting there.

29:26.365 --> 29:28.267
Twelve jurors
saw it differently.

29:28.334 --> 29:30.837
Yeah, but that's because
she had me lure him
into my bedroom

29:30.903 --> 29:33.639
to set him up,
and then she shot him,

29:33.705 --> 29:36.008
and she told me
to tell the cops

29:36.075 --> 29:37.910
that he just came after me.

29:37.977 --> 29:40.880
But you couldn't lie for her.
No, because in my mind,

29:40.947 --> 29:42.681
what she did wasn't wrong.

29:42.748 --> 29:44.316
She was protecting us.

29:44.383 --> 29:45.684
She was protecting me.

29:45.751 --> 29:48.487
And I just trusted one cop

29:48.554 --> 29:50.522
enough to tell the truth.

29:50.589 --> 29:51.657
Buck.

29:51.723 --> 29:54.026
And I don't know why,

29:54.093 --> 29:56.462
for some reason,

29:56.528 --> 30:00.666
it was important to me that
he knew what really happened.

30:00.732 --> 30:02.534
My mom,

30:02.601 --> 30:04.070
she saved my life, Chris.

30:04.136 --> 30:06.705
I don't care what anyone says.
She saved me.

30:06.772 --> 30:10.843
But the D.A. wanted to improve
his conviction rate, so...

30:13.212 --> 30:15.381
I'm the reason my mom spent
18 years in prison.

30:15.447 --> 30:16.782
No.
Yeah.

30:16.849 --> 30:18.784
No.
I could've kept
her out, but...

30:22.221 --> 30:24.156
I betrayed her.

30:26.125 --> 30:28.160
I'm sorry, this is
unprofessional.

30:28.227 --> 30:29.428
No, it's not.

30:31.964 --> 30:34.066
Listen.

30:35.801 --> 30:38.537
I don't like
opening up, either,

30:38.604 --> 30:40.506
but it's good to
do it sometimes.

30:43.242 --> 30:44.510
Thanks for trusting me.

30:47.679 --> 30:50.950
I can't even imagine what
that must have been like.

30:51.017 --> 30:54.586
All I know is that it's made
you who you are today,

30:54.653 --> 30:57.656
which is somebody I would
trust my life with.

30:59.658 --> 31:03.262
And look...

31:03.329 --> 31:06.933
Cards up, I, uh,
I went and I read
the court transcripts

31:06.999 --> 31:08.834
of your mom's case.

31:08.901 --> 31:12.638
And maybe what she did
was the right thing to do.

31:12.704 --> 31:14.640
But making you
a part of it wasn't.

31:19.145 --> 31:20.379
Meet you outside.

31:20.446 --> 31:21.981
Thanks. I'll be right there.

31:26.285 --> 31:27.819
Irina?

31:29.555 --> 31:32.558
All right, listen.
Chris, Street and I
are gonna be just offstage,

31:32.624 --> 31:34.160
literally waiting
in the wings.

31:34.226 --> 31:36.628
You nervous?

31:36.695 --> 31:38.931
About someone
trying to kill me?

31:38.998 --> 31:41.433
You're not going
to let that happen.
Hmm.

31:41.500 --> 31:44.603
Now, giving a speech in front
of hundreds of people, it's...

31:44.670 --> 31:46.772
Trust me. Public speaking
is not my thing, either.

31:46.838 --> 31:48.174
That's what you're scared of?

31:48.240 --> 31:51.243
You risk your life every day
for people you
don't even know.

31:51.310 --> 31:53.512
How can you do that
and not be afraid?

31:53.579 --> 31:55.314
I just know
it needs to be done.

31:55.381 --> 31:58.684
We need to protect those
who can't protect themselves,
make sure they have a voice.

31:58.750 --> 32:01.253
I think you and I
both know what it's like
not to have one.

32:07.026 --> 32:08.827
Give me two!
Two!

32:08.894 --> 32:10.662
Closet only!

32:10.729 --> 32:13.165
The rich and the powerful
count on us being cowards,

32:13.232 --> 32:15.434
being afraid.

32:15.501 --> 32:18.537
But the more we stand up,
the more they have to listen.

32:18.604 --> 32:20.872
And the more power
we take from them.

32:20.939 --> 32:22.441
Closet only.
Two, two.

32:23.442 --> 32:25.044
Bathroom only.

32:25.111 --> 32:27.446
It's not too late
to fight back.

32:27.513 --> 32:30.216
We all have an obligation
to do our part.

32:30.282 --> 32:31.717
Thank you.

32:34.686 --> 32:36.922
Subject's moving
off stage right.

32:36.989 --> 32:38.190
20-David, you have eyes.

32:40.959 --> 32:43.162
It was a brave speech.
Just doing my part.

32:43.229 --> 32:45.064
My source texted
that he'd find me

32:45.131 --> 32:46.932
before I get to
the green room.

32:46.999 --> 32:48.234
WOMAN:
We love you!

32:48.300 --> 32:50.102
That means he could be
anyone in here. Hey.

32:50.169 --> 32:51.570
Take it easy. Take it easy.

32:51.637 --> 32:53.105
Irina, please sign my book?

32:53.172 --> 32:54.640
Irina, this has to be quick.

32:54.706 --> 32:56.175
It's okay.

32:58.910 --> 33:02.014
30-David.
Suspect's apartment's clear.

33:02.081 --> 33:03.482
No sign of our guy.

33:03.549 --> 33:05.417
But he did leave
some goodies behind.

33:05.484 --> 33:06.952
One at a time. One at a time.
Take it easy now.

33:07.019 --> 33:08.554
Guys, step back.

33:08.620 --> 33:10.356
Ma'am, excuse me.
Step back, please.

33:10.422 --> 33:11.590
HONDO:
One at a time. Easy.

33:11.657 --> 33:13.759
Hey, bud, you got to wait
back in the press section.

33:13.825 --> 33:15.761
Oh, I'm sorry.
Just want to get
a question in really quick.

33:15.827 --> 33:16.862
Now is not a good time.

33:16.928 --> 33:18.664
MAN: Would you sign
my book, please?

33:26.472 --> 33:28.874
Looks like our guy's a cooker.

33:28.940 --> 33:31.043
HONDO:
One at a time. One at a
time. Take it easy now.

33:31.110 --> 33:32.878
One at a time!
Guys, step
back here!

33:32.944 --> 33:34.380
No pushing. No pushing.
Step back, guys.

33:34.446 --> 33:35.881
HONDO:
One at a time.

33:35.947 --> 33:37.783
Easy.

33:37.849 --> 33:40.286
(INDISTINCT
OVERLAPPING CHATTER)

33:40.352 --> 33:44.123
25-David, I got press
going behind stage left.
Let's check 'em out.

33:44.190 --> 33:46.458
51-David, get the two side.
I'll take the four.

33:46.525 --> 33:48.427
STREET:
Step back, please.

33:48.494 --> 33:51.163
MAN:
Could you sign this, Irina?

34:02.141 --> 34:04.943
The suspect left
acetaminophen,
caffeine pills,

34:05.010 --> 34:08.547
aspirin and a prosumer
chem lab behind.
Back up. Back up.

34:08.614 --> 34:10.182
Luca also found QL
and sulfur in the fridge.

34:10.249 --> 34:12.084
He's making VX poison gas.

34:12.151 --> 34:15.721
D-Team, be advised,
possible biological agents
in close vicinity.

34:15.787 --> 34:19.191
I'll notify Central Division.
We need to lock this
place down.

34:19.258 --> 34:20.926
Irina, that's enough.
That's enough.
Change of plans.

34:20.992 --> 34:23.329
We have to get you to the
green room right now.
Street? Move 'em back! Move!

34:23.395 --> 34:24.930
All right, folks, make a hole.
Back up. Make some space!
Let's go. Back up, people!

34:24.996 --> 34:26.598
We haven't found an activator,
but clearly...

34:26.665 --> 34:28.900
He's weaponizing it.
The only way
they could have gotten it

34:28.967 --> 34:31.370
through security was
if it could pass through
a metal detector.

34:31.437 --> 34:33.004
I'm pretty sure
pens could do that.

34:36.808 --> 34:39.645
Irina, your autograph, please.
Proceeds go to
Operation Underground.

34:39.711 --> 34:41.647
One last thing, Hondo.
This is important.

34:43.682 --> 34:46.218
Please back off, okay?
Back off. Make some room.

34:46.285 --> 34:48.620
LUCA: Hondo,
we think they're using
pens to hide the VX.

34:48.687 --> 34:49.855
Irina, don't touch that pen!

34:55.627 --> 34:58.530
Street, Street,
get the runner!
Street, the runner!

35:00.466 --> 35:03.169
Chris

35:03.235 --> 35:05.837
I got you, Chris. Chris?

35:05.904 --> 35:08.540
Chris? This is 20-David
to Command. Officer down.

35:08.607 --> 35:11.143
Exposure
to biological agent VX.

35:11.210 --> 35:14.446
Be advised. Code 3.
I repeat, officer down.

35:18.250 --> 35:20.352
Deac? Deac, Chris got hit
with the VX.

35:20.419 --> 35:22.421
I need the atropine
in the med cache
out of Black Betty now.

35:22.488 --> 35:24.823
All units be advised, I need
all intersections cleared

35:24.890 --> 35:26.024
from Huntington Park
to downtown,

35:26.091 --> 35:27.859
starting on Western
to Exposition.

35:27.926 --> 35:29.828
Code 3, I need
an R/A at location.

35:29.895 --> 35:31.830
We'll be there in ten, Hondo.
HONDO: Make it eight,

35:31.897 --> 35:33.665
or she's gone, man.
CORTEZ:
Tan and Rocker, status.

35:33.732 --> 35:36.702
We found our two backup
shooters. Kitchen has direct
access to the green room.

36:20.712 --> 36:21.847
Give me your hands!

36:28.954 --> 36:30.756
Right side clear.

36:30.822 --> 36:32.391
Let side clear, Hondo.

36:32.458 --> 36:34.293
Got your guy
from the food court, Hondo.

36:40.165 --> 36:42.200
I got the guy who dosed Chris.

36:42.268 --> 36:44.436
Tan, take him
before I lose it on him.

36:44.503 --> 36:46.905
25-David, all three shooters
are accounted for.

36:46.972 --> 36:49.040
Go. I got this.

36:49.107 --> 36:51.377
Stay in there, Chris. Chris?

36:57.015 --> 36:58.884
You grab my hand,
and you squeeze.

36:58.950 --> 37:00.786
Let's go.
HONDO: And just
keep squeezing.

37:00.852 --> 37:02.954
Do not stop.
Do not let go.

37:03.021 --> 37:04.323
HONDO:
Deacon, where are you?

37:04.390 --> 37:05.657
We're two minutes out, Hondo.

37:05.724 --> 37:07.693
Here we go.

37:07.759 --> 37:10.329
Hold on, Chris.
You hear me?
You hold on.

37:13.699 --> 37:16.302
Stay with me, Chris.
I got you. I got you.

37:17.836 --> 37:18.970
I'm right out front.
I got her ready.

37:19.037 --> 37:20.772
All right.
The shot's prepped, Hondo.

37:20.839 --> 37:22.541
Squeeze my hand.
Stay with me.

37:22.608 --> 37:24.443
How long has it been?
Seven minutes and counting.

37:24.510 --> 37:26.512
Chris, hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

37:26.578 --> 37:28.380
Keep fighting.
Come on, keep fighting.
Come on now, Chris.

37:28.447 --> 37:31.450
Come on. Squeeze, Chris.
Chris! Hey! Chris!

37:31.517 --> 37:34.286
Hey, stay with me.
You're good. You're good.

37:34.353 --> 37:35.854
Let's go! Let's go!
STREET: Come on. Come on.

37:35.921 --> 37:37.689
HONDO: Stay with us, Chris.
Come on now. Let's go! Move!

37:37.756 --> 37:40.459
Give me room! Give me room!
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

37:40.526 --> 37:42.394
You got one shot
at the heart, Deac. Come on.

37:45.163 --> 37:47.098
Come on, Chris. Come on.
Come on, Chris.

37:49.868 --> 37:52.037
LUCA: Come on, Chris.

37:52.103 --> 37:54.573
Come on, Chris.
Breathe. Hey.

37:54.640 --> 37:57.042
There she is.
LUCA: Oh... Hey.

37:57.809 --> 37:58.910
LUCA:
You scared us.

37:58.977 --> 38:00.346
HONDO: Don't do that
again, please.

38:00.412 --> 38:01.913
You good?

38:01.980 --> 38:03.749
Stupid question, I guess.

38:04.816 --> 38:07.118
STREET: Oh, my God.
LUCA: Hey, man...

38:10.055 --> 38:12.391
And you thought what
I did was brave.

38:12.458 --> 38:15.727
Hmm. You know, sometimes
I do get scared, Irina.

38:16.828 --> 38:18.129
Seeing Chris like that
was one of them.

38:18.196 --> 38:20.832
Hmm. They're lucky to have you
as their leader.

38:20.899 --> 38:23.335
No. No. I'm lucky
to have them.

38:23.402 --> 38:27.339
You really think your
source is gonna show up?

38:27.406 --> 38:31.142
I told him I trust you,
and so should him.

38:31.209 --> 38:32.711
I appreciate you
coming around.

38:32.778 --> 38:35.381
I'm sorry for the trouble
I caused you, Hondo.

38:36.314 --> 38:37.716
Let's just hope
it was worth it.

38:46.858 --> 38:48.427
I'm Shaolin...

38:48.494 --> 38:49.861
Your source.

38:53.264 --> 38:55.701
Nice to finally
meet you, Irina.

39:00.939 --> 39:02.273
NEWS BROADCASTER:
Federal authorities today

39:02.340 --> 39:04.710
seized an estimated
50,000 guns

39:04.776 --> 39:06.445
originating in Russia.

39:06.512 --> 39:08.179
They were being smuggled
into the country

39:08.246 --> 39:10.949
through an elaborate tunnel
network from Mexico

39:11.016 --> 39:12.984
through the southern border
of California.

39:13.051 --> 39:14.620
Intelligence officials...

39:14.686 --> 39:17.989
So glad the CIA is
getting credit for such
a righteous bust.

39:18.056 --> 39:22.661
Four Russians in custody,
a list of ex-KGB agents
snooping around in L.A...

39:22.728 --> 39:26.532
The CIA wants me to
tell you, unofficially,
we've made them very happy.

39:28.066 --> 39:30.301
So, I heard Chris got out
of the hospital already?

39:30.368 --> 39:33.004
Yeah, she did.
And she's good.

39:33.071 --> 39:34.973
Actually,

39:35.040 --> 39:36.675
she's back
to her old ways.

39:42.881 --> 39:44.382
Look, Luca, you got to
sleep somewhere tonight,

39:44.450 --> 39:46.485
and if you say no
to this place,
you'd be breaking a law.

39:46.552 --> 39:49.087
To prevent that, we put down
the first month's deposit.

39:49.154 --> 39:50.388
You what? Guys, I...

39:50.456 --> 39:52.591
We know you don't like
living alone, Luca,

39:52.658 --> 39:54.693
so we fixed it.
CHRIS: Luca!

39:54.760 --> 39:56.294
Meet your new roommate.

39:56.361 --> 39:57.663
Say what?

39:57.729 --> 39:59.465
Whose dog is this?
Yours.

39:59.531 --> 40:00.666
Hey...

40:00.732 --> 40:02.801
Meet Duke.
Recently retired from duty.

40:02.868 --> 40:04.970
My friend Joe,
with Riverside PD,
offered him up.

40:05.036 --> 40:07.973
He's gonna need
a new home, too.
Seriously, guys?

40:08.039 --> 40:10.509
DEACON: Yep. And, your
new place takes pets.
Hey.

40:10.576 --> 40:12.444
You shouldn't have.

40:12.511 --> 40:14.279
Aw.

40:18.950 --> 40:21.219
Hey, uh, Hondo.

40:21.286 --> 40:22.821
What's up, kid?

40:22.888 --> 40:26.024
I, uh... I just wanted
to say thank you

40:26.091 --> 40:28.894
for offering to pull some
strings for my mom.

40:28.960 --> 40:31.196
Of course.
I'm happy to do it.

40:31.262 --> 40:32.898
But, uh, she's gonna
stay with me.

40:32.964 --> 40:34.666
So... It's all good.

40:35.867 --> 40:37.002
All right.

40:37.068 --> 40:39.104
Yeah. Thanks, man.
Yeah.

40:52.383 --> 40:53.819
Irina.

40:53.885 --> 40:56.688
So, I hear your guards
have a good advance plan
for Manila.

40:56.755 --> 40:58.056
That's more like it.

40:58.123 --> 40:59.991
They know they've got
a tough act to follow here.

41:00.058 --> 41:01.827
Too bad you're not
coming with me.

41:01.893 --> 41:04.530
No. That sounds tempting,
but duty calls...

41:09.901 --> 41:11.803
Wow. Uh...

41:11.870 --> 41:13.404
What was that for?

41:13.471 --> 41:14.906
I've learned that
life is too short

41:14.973 --> 41:17.576
not to do the
things you want.

41:17.643 --> 41:20.211
Maybe I'll be back
in Los Angeles one day.

41:20.278 --> 41:22.013
Until then, you stay safe.

41:26.618 --> 41:28.186
Bye.

41:28.253 --> 41:32.290
* I never let my guard go down

41:32.357 --> 41:36.895
* But you messed me up
when you came around

41:36.962 --> 41:39.230
* When the high wore off

41:39.297 --> 41:40.866
* Know you needed space

41:40.932 --> 41:42.300
* But I don't wanna wait

41:42.367 --> 41:45.203
* I don't wanna mistake

41:45.270 --> 41:48.073
* A few thousand miles
and an ocean away

41:49.841 --> 41:50.976
* But I see the sunrise

41:51.042 --> 41:52.143
Let's get out of here.

41:52.210 --> 41:53.311
Yeah?
Yeah.

41:53.378 --> 41:55.180
* As the tears roll by

41:57.015 --> 42:00.552
* Ooh, ooh, ooh...

42:00.619 --> 42:04.222
* I'm helpless
when I'm oceans away

42:06.057 --> 42:10.095
* Ooh, ooh, ooh...

42:10.161 --> 42:12.864
* I'm helpless
when I'm oceans away *
