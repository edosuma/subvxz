- <i>Previously on "Wynonna Earp"...</i>
- I'm not a bad person,

00:03.500 --> 00:05.882
and if you know what's good for
you, stop treating me like one.

00:06.000 --> 00:07.984
- We're your sisters now.
- I want a girl.

00:08.061 --> 00:11.350
- Predictable.
- That girl has the demon inside her...

00:11.405 --> 00:12.693
- Shoot her.
- which will spread

00:12.719 --> 00:14.155
like a virus if we don't destroy it.

00:20.110 --> 00:22.868
Dolls, Black Badge is gone.

00:23.142 --> 00:25.298
Wynonna... you're not alone.

00:25.462 --> 00:26.869
You can say that again.

00:40.807 --> 00:43.159
Pitiful way
for an elite operative to die,

00:43.776 --> 00:45.174
by not covering his own ass.

00:45.451 --> 00:47.157
Don't talk about my partner's ass.

00:50.587 --> 00:54.004
Mr. Holliday. It's good to see you.

00:54.120 --> 00:56.824
I would return the sentiment,
except I hate you.

00:56.871 --> 00:59.215
We're on the same team now, all right?

01:02.425 --> 01:04.200
Gentlemen, I'm gonna lower my weapon.

01:05.441 --> 01:06.904
I prefer you don't shoot me.

01:09.278 --> 01:10.654
Sir...

01:10.755 --> 01:12.693
can you please tell me
what the hell is going on here?

01:12.747 --> 01:14.534
Agent Chetri tried to make contact

01:14.686 --> 01:17.120
and realized that the BBD HQ was empty.

01:17.182 --> 01:19.737
Smart kid. Black Badge
has cut you, your team,

01:19.784 --> 01:22.893
and the entire Ghost River Triangle loose.

01:24.557 --> 01:26.534
You're lying, man. Get outta here.

01:26.783 --> 01:28.080
If he's lyin'...

01:28.744 --> 01:30.478
he's got the best poker face

01:31.557 --> 01:33.150
I've ever laid eyes on.

01:33.400 --> 01:35.084
Wow.

01:35.377 --> 01:37.310
We were ghosted.

01:42.418 --> 01:43.839
- Why?
- The powers that be

01:43.864 --> 01:45.895
don't wanna spend money
on a war they can't win.

01:46.229 --> 01:49.401
The Black Badge unit we knew
no longer exists, Xavier.

01:49.448 --> 01:51.494
It's gone, and if you wanna
keep surviving,

01:51.533 --> 01:53.636
you'll think real hard
about getting gone yourself.

01:53.856 --> 01:56.012
No. Can't do it. Sorry.

01:56.114 --> 01:58.107
I haven't completed my mission... Sir.

01:58.176 --> 02:00.223
I thought you might say that.

02:01.784 --> 02:04.149
This is all I can give you.

02:04.463 --> 02:05.750
The file's incomplete,

02:05.775 --> 02:08.640
but let's just say that, uh...
you're not the only thing

02:08.687 --> 02:10.586
Mr. Holliday let loose
from the safe house.

02:12.536 --> 02:13.562
Hey.

02:13.632 --> 02:15.446
Sir. Sir! Hold this.

02:15.568 --> 02:17.099
Sir!

02:17.959 --> 02:20.979
Government agencies just don't vanish!

02:21.229 --> 02:23.135
Black Badge isn't a government agency.

02:25.392 --> 02:26.666
It never was.

02:28.339 --> 02:30.861
Well, don't she look pretty as a plague.

02:37.699 --> 02:40.066
<i>Taken! Stolen!</i>

02:42.361 --> 02:44.455
This isn't open to the public.

02:52.245 --> 02:54.104
<i>Where is it?</i>

02:54.776 --> 02:56.886
<i>Where is it?</i>

02:57.823 --> 03:00.507
<i>Whoopsies. Pulled a little too hard.</i>

03:00.585 --> 03:02.601
<i>Waste not, want not.</i>

03:31.280 --> 03:33.131
- So...
- So...

03:33.248 --> 03:34.913
Pff... yeah.

03:34.938 --> 03:36.585
Remember that time you touched the goo?

03:36.718 --> 03:38.311
- Wynonna!
- You never touch the goo.

03:38.335 --> 03:40.720
You're... you're pregnant!

03:40.751 --> 03:42.626
Oh! Do you have to use that word?

03:42.689 --> 03:45.682
- The big plus sign says yes!
- okay, well, I'm really not ready

03:45.707 --> 03:48.808
to, you know, talk about
all the juicy details.

03:48.863 --> 03:51.058
Oh, I'm so fine
with leaving out the juice.

03:51.105 --> 03:52.402
- Oh, good.
- Yeah.

03:52.448 --> 03:54.691
If you have questions, you
should feel free to ask them.

03:54.753 --> 03:58.219
Well, one. You should
feel free to ask one.

03:58.515 --> 03:59.789
Okay.

04:00.648 --> 04:02.547
How far along are you?

04:02.650 --> 04:04.495
- Nope. Nope. Nope!
- But, Wynonna!

04:04.520 --> 04:06.690
Well, you can't just
"nope" this away, okay? "Nope"?

04:06.730 --> 04:09.849
- Not a viable plan.
- It is right now! Right now, I have time.

04:10.123 --> 04:12.513
Well, only a certain amount.
Hence my question.

04:12.538 --> 04:14.138
Look, Waverly...

04:14.716 --> 04:17.262
my one Boss just got her head blown off,

04:17.288 --> 04:19.454
and my other Boss is a lizard.

04:19.666 --> 04:22.392
Or a tiny, super sexy dragon. Who knows?

04:22.439 --> 04:24.649
And still, always, there are the demons,

04:24.712 --> 04:28.109
so I cannot... I cannot
deal with this right now.

04:28.142 --> 04:30.836
I can't. Please.

04:31.461 --> 04:33.781
- Okay.
- Thank you.

04:36.327 --> 04:38.789
I'm glad you're not possessed
by a tentacle anymore.

04:38.867 --> 04:40.413
Yeah. Me too.

04:40.873 --> 04:42.350
Okay. I'll see you at the office.

04:43.272 --> 04:44.792
Shit!

04:44.866 --> 04:46.895
- What?
- I have to pee again.

04:55.957 --> 04:58.366
I really, really want you
to give me a case. Any case.

04:58.444 --> 05:00.257
- Sorry, girl, I got nothing.
- Come on!

05:00.327 --> 05:03.077
Cannibal psychiatrist?
Scorpion Shih Tzu hybrid?

05:03.374 --> 05:05.405
Oh, creepy clowns!
Those are really hot right now.

05:05.498 --> 05:07.848
- Wynonna, take a day off.
- Ooh.

05:08.085 --> 05:09.465
Get a spa treatment.

05:09.518 --> 05:12.371
Purgatory doesn't have any spas...

05:12.731 --> 05:15.364
unless you count the jacuzzi Willie
drives around in his pick-up.

05:15.473 --> 05:18.059
- Go shopping?
- Why? Do my clothes look tight?

05:18.101 --> 05:19.832
Hi!

05:19.949 --> 05:21.934
- For you.
- Yeeeah!

05:25.088 --> 05:28.674
Question. Why does my coffee taste
like it was brewed in Nedley's hat?

05:28.731 --> 05:30.174
Because it's not coffee,

05:30.252 --> 05:33.786
it's Soothing Sunshine
herbal tea. Caffeine free.

05:33.880 --> 05:35.977
Well, if it sounds like

05:35.979 --> 05:38.653
a hippie hemorrhoid cream,
I don't want it in my cup.

05:39.528 --> 05:42.003
Waverly, can you
get her out of here, and then,

05:42.028 --> 05:44.185
you know, come back
because I'm off in 10 minutes.

05:44.304 --> 05:47.444
Ugh. You guys make
<i>The Notebook</i> look bleak.

05:47.666 --> 05:49.546
Do you practice
those gooey eyes in the mirror,

05:49.571 --> 05:51.351
or is it just natural talent?

05:55.036 --> 05:58.439
- My Boss was killed.
- God really is dead.

06:01.630 --> 06:03.693
<i>To those wives who came before us,</i>

06:03.755 --> 06:07.013
<i>eternally a part of us,
speak and I will listen.</i>

06:13.433 --> 06:15.433
- Can you see it?
- Quiet.

06:16.136 --> 06:18.699
You've lost our husband's
favour. You've lost the gift.

06:18.724 --> 06:21.968
I have lost nothing! You, on the
other hand, have lost us everything!

06:21.993 --> 06:24.536
What was I supposed to do?
Bobo moved the second seal!

06:24.561 --> 06:26.308
And took its location to his grave.

06:26.417 --> 06:27.935
So we ask the Stone Witch.

06:27.990 --> 06:29.372
- Missing.
- Juan Carlo?

06:29.421 --> 06:31.421
We are not strong enough yet.

06:31.513 --> 06:34.598
We'll find it. We will tear
this town apart if we have to.

06:34.646 --> 06:36.035
We don't have time!

06:36.114 --> 06:38.699
You've already drawn eyes
to our work, thanks to that priest.

06:45.014 --> 06:47.261
The Clockmaker's mansion.

06:47.402 --> 06:49.231
Do we think he's still in the Triangle?

06:49.319 --> 06:51.386
Hypnos? He'll be protected.

06:51.464 --> 06:53.831
We'll have to find a way
through his nasty little spells.

06:58.281 --> 07:00.245
We already have one.

07:20.667 --> 07:21.893
It's Poppy, right?

07:21.917 --> 07:23.917
Pretty.

07:27.429 --> 07:30.160
No, no, don't! Don't! He's
not supposed to wake up yet.

07:38.401 --> 07:40.200
How did you get in here?

07:40.256 --> 07:41.973
I walked.

07:43.091 --> 07:44.414
You're human.

07:44.942 --> 07:46.157
Foolish.

07:46.367 --> 07:49.297
I'll rip you from limb to limb.

07:50.477 --> 07:51.941
And I'll enjoy it.

07:53.831 --> 07:55.355
It won't work, Hypnos.

07:55.419 --> 07:57.542
The Widows made me immune
to your little tricksy.

07:57.972 --> 08:00.300
You're gonna do exactly as I say,

08:00.534 --> 08:03.758
or I'm gonna use pretty Poppy
for target practice.

08:03.938 --> 08:05.719
What do these "Widows" want?

08:05.796 --> 08:08.516
Time. They want time.

08:18.036 --> 08:19.754
I was sorting through the decorations

08:19.793 --> 08:21.993
in our basement, when I felt...

08:22.042 --> 08:24.076
Hungry? Nauseous? Horny?

08:24.686 --> 08:27.320
No judgment. You're a nun, not a saint.

08:27.670 --> 08:29.053
Cold.

08:29.678 --> 08:31.241
Freezing cold.

08:31.663 --> 08:33.101
I could see my breath.

08:33.207 --> 08:35.908
And then I turned around
and saw her. A Victorian...

08:35.943 --> 08:37.467
woman in black.

08:37.522 --> 08:39.046
And then I don't know what happened,

08:39.124 --> 08:41.583
suddenly I couldn't move. Not a muscle.

08:41.778 --> 08:44.843
And then... I just watched
as she... ate him.

08:46.326 --> 08:49.147
Don't worry, sister. You're safe.

08:49.279 --> 08:52.047
We'll find out who did this. Come on.

08:55.110 --> 08:57.577
So you've seen
this woman in black before.

08:57.624 --> 08:58.913
At the creepy crawly condo.

08:58.915 --> 09:03.108
She must be the one who got ceremonial
with the crows and poor Earl.

09:03.520 --> 09:07.550
Shit. I thought I was seeing things.
I thought it was Willa.

09:07.824 --> 09:10.258
The Condo was built
on a former Catholic school.

09:10.260 --> 09:11.940
Now we're looking at a church basement.

09:12.065 --> 09:14.466
- Both are... Yeah.
- Consecrated ground.

09:14.768 --> 09:16.467
She was looking
for the same thing again.

09:16.772 --> 09:18.740
Another seal!?
There's more than one seal?

09:18.873 --> 09:21.645
Okay, if someone moved it,
it could still be on another

09:21.670 --> 09:23.467
sacred site, right?
How many of those do we have?

09:23.492 --> 09:26.538
In the Triangle? Uh...
churches, synagogues, mosques?

09:26.563 --> 09:28.772
Yeah. I can narrow it down using
an algorithm and a complex set of...

09:28.796 --> 09:29.990
- Jeremy.
- Math!

09:30.015 --> 09:32.070
I can narrow it down using math.

09:32.133 --> 09:35.116
- I just need 24 hours and a burrito.
- Hey. You might want to sit down.

09:35.118 --> 09:36.824
Why? I'm fine. I feel fine.
I'm totally fine.

09:36.849 --> 09:38.636
I was actually talking to Jeremy.

09:38.840 --> 09:40.327
Oh, yeah. Sure.

09:40.351 --> 09:41.452
Whoa!

09:41.477 --> 09:44.179
So this is good news, right?
I mean, no more blood contract!

09:44.204 --> 09:47.228
- Yeah, no more backup either.
- Then who is paying us?

09:47.230 --> 09:50.615
- Does this mean I'm fired?
- We are free agents.

09:50.881 --> 09:53.467
Free to make our own rules and
to pursue our own objectives.

09:53.837 --> 09:56.222
Welcome to the club.
I've been here a while.

09:56.511 --> 09:58.948
I'll show you what areas are off limits.

09:59.291 --> 10:00.697
Well, that's my point.

10:00.753 --> 10:03.749
There are no areas
that are off limits anymore.

10:04.362 --> 10:06.447
What is happening?

10:06.506 --> 10:09.022
Okay, I'm gonna need
someone to write me a reference letter.

10:09.373 --> 10:11.124
Oi! Weirdos!

10:12.163 --> 10:14.183
Crazy chick. Big ass magic gun.

10:14.468 --> 10:16.632
There are still demons
terrorizing Purgatory.

10:16.793 --> 10:19.661
Garroting priests, for example.
Mucho illegal.

10:19.663 --> 10:21.875
Not super Christian. So...

10:22.375 --> 10:24.726
you're all free to do what you
want, but far as I'm concerned

10:24.765 --> 10:27.797
we hunt supernatural shit.
We kill supernatural shit.

10:27.847 --> 10:30.078
No piece of metal needed.

10:31.196 --> 10:32.681
Yeah, Peacemaker is metal.

10:32.837 --> 10:36.392
- Zip it, Algebra.
- okay. I'm going to go.

10:36.813 --> 10:39.720
- The hell you are.
- The hell I am!

10:39.849 --> 10:41.610
I'm gonna go find that seal!

10:42.161 --> 10:44.439
Anyone want a snack?
Doc, do you want a snack?

10:44.526 --> 10:46.345
I'm gonna get... I'm gonna
get you a snack. Okay.

10:48.017 --> 10:50.415
Hey, uh, Wynonna.
You wanna grab coffee with me?

10:50.815 --> 10:54.065
There's something I wanna
discuss with you that's... personal.

10:55.565 --> 10:58.026
- Yeah, sure.
- How about she meets you there?

10:58.284 --> 11:00.806
Yeah, we've got stuff
we need to discuss.

11:01.080 --> 11:04.502
Yeah, sure. No problem.
The diner. Half hour.

11:05.260 --> 11:06.876
Don't be late.

11:08.707 --> 11:09.947
Ow!

11:09.972 --> 11:12.652
You realize Dolls is about
to tell you he wants to be more.

11:12.793 --> 11:15.201
- More than a dragon?
- More than your Boss.

11:15.420 --> 11:17.585
- What?
- He asked you for coffee

11:17.587 --> 11:19.803
to discuss something personal.
It's a date.

11:20.288 --> 11:22.037
Yeah, and you said yes.

11:22.209 --> 11:25.044
- You have to talk to Doc.
- I don't have to do anything.

11:25.195 --> 11:29.083
Henry's a big part of this whole
situation you got going on, isn't he?

11:30.411 --> 11:33.567
Yeah, and now Dolls is...
going for it. I mean...

11:33.803 --> 11:36.586
You hiding this is not fair,
to either of them.

11:37.360 --> 11:38.914
Tough shit.

11:38.975 --> 11:42.424
It's my decision who to tell
and when and it's my situation,

11:42.471 --> 11:45.700
and nobody gets to decide
how to handle it but me.

11:45.794 --> 11:47.122
So stop pushing me,

11:47.183 --> 11:49.153
and while you're at it, stop judging me.

11:51.721 --> 11:53.488
Okay.

11:55.090 --> 11:57.667
Your girlfriend's looking at you
like you're the fudge to her sundae.

11:57.857 --> 12:00.324
She and I haven't
talked since, you know,

12:00.370 --> 12:02.768
talk-talked, since I was tentacled.

12:03.159 --> 12:05.466
- Well, you should go.
- I can stay.

12:06.026 --> 12:08.051
- If you want me to.
- No.

12:08.395 --> 12:11.527
One of us should have a non-
screwed up romantic thingamajig.

12:19.424 --> 12:21.220
Holy shit.

12:21.706 --> 12:24.995
Shit! Hey! Hey guys, I found it!

12:27.182 --> 12:28.937
Yeah!

12:32.796 --> 12:35.430
You taste like my Waverly again.

12:46.334 --> 12:48.123
What's wrong?

12:48.240 --> 12:50.186
I was... I was just thinking...

12:50.358 --> 12:52.358
how much of the other times were...

12:52.982 --> 12:54.721
were you... you?

12:55.260 --> 12:59.096
You know, because you said things,
and we... did things, and...

12:59.422 --> 13:01.126
I don't know what was real.

13:01.353 --> 13:03.978
No. It was all real.

13:04.181 --> 13:05.712
Okay?

13:06.039 --> 13:07.862
It was all me.

13:16.580 --> 13:18.150
How can you be sure?

13:18.510 --> 13:20.064
Because...

13:20.452 --> 13:22.330
I don't remember much about when...

13:22.791 --> 13:24.611
it was in control.

13:25.589 --> 13:26.964
But...

13:27.886 --> 13:30.722
I remember every second I was with you.

13:31.493 --> 13:33.167
Each touch.

13:35.279 --> 13:36.621
Every kiss.

13:46.327 --> 13:48.923
Well, when you put it that way...

14:07.423 --> 14:09.509
- Oh, hey.
- Hey, how are you?

14:10.196 --> 14:11.603
- Good.
- So...

14:11.887 --> 14:13.798
What will it be,
since you can't have whiskey?

14:13.939 --> 14:16.807
What? What's wrong with... I can have
whiskey. What's wrong with whiskey?

14:16.809 --> 14:18.897
- I can have whiskey still.
- It's eleven in the morning.

14:19.045 --> 14:21.491
- Oh. That.
- And it's also a diner.

14:21.780 --> 14:24.048
Oh, well, a diner in Purgatory.

14:24.050 --> 14:26.138
There's hooch behind the counter
next to a homemade taser

14:26.163 --> 14:27.887
and a can of spray cheese.

14:29.106 --> 14:30.442
Damn.

14:31.887 --> 14:34.403
I've missed you, like... so much.

14:35.098 --> 14:36.877
Look, um, Earp...

14:36.996 --> 14:40.650
- Mercedes! Yo!
- Oh, hello, Wynonna.

14:40.733 --> 14:42.041
Hello. Sit.

14:44.362 --> 14:47.252
What's wrong, silver spoon
stuck up your ass again?

14:48.822 --> 14:50.340
Okay, something's definitely wrong.

14:50.447 --> 14:52.409
Tucker is the real pain in my ass.

14:52.411 --> 14:54.557
Questions everything I do.
He's a real loose cannon.

14:54.635 --> 14:57.736
Any moment I feel he'll just explode
and ruin everything.

14:58.514 --> 15:00.228
Enough to drive me to drink.

15:00.361 --> 15:02.483
Like you need any help, right?

15:02.553 --> 15:06.531
You know you can call me.
When he's being an asshole. Talk it out.

15:06.563 --> 15:08.458
Speak of the devil.

15:08.532 --> 15:09.812
I better take this.

15:09.882 --> 15:12.327
He might be calling to tell me
he's taken a hostage.

15:12.413 --> 15:13.960
Take your time.

15:15.815 --> 15:18.893
Anyways, as I was saying, um...

15:19.503 --> 15:22.206
- I was thinking that...
- Oh, I gotta tinkle.

15:22.308 --> 15:24.778
Oh, yeah. As women do.

15:25.176 --> 15:26.949
And men. Most men.

15:27.140 --> 15:29.551
And most living creatures.

15:29.907 --> 15:32.140
I think. I... I skipped biology.

15:34.890 --> 15:36.294
Whoa.

15:38.456 --> 15:41.474
What was in that tea?

15:54.310 --> 15:55.545
Wha...?

15:56.788 --> 15:58.489
What the hell, dude?

16:12.920 --> 16:15.267
I'm gonna need a bigger coat.

16:38.873 --> 16:40.489
Whoa.

16:40.865 --> 16:42.747
That's new.

16:48.880 --> 16:50.202
Dolls!

16:51.403 --> 16:53.200
Oh, wow.

16:54.013 --> 16:55.872
Did I just pass out?

16:56.058 --> 16:57.692
Everybody in here did.

16:57.833 --> 16:59.927
- What?!
- I think we've been asleep

16:59.988 --> 17:02.902
for a long ass time.

17:07.896 --> 17:10.019
Whaaat?

17:15.395 --> 17:16.946
Uh...

17:17.916 --> 17:19.752
Wynonna?

17:20.405 --> 17:22.387
This isn't natural.

17:24.021 --> 17:25.607
The whole...

17:26.126 --> 17:29.160
town... is asleep right now.

17:32.058 --> 17:33.694
Waverly!

17:36.695 --> 17:38.895
- Waves!
- What?

17:38.897 --> 17:40.699
Does this look normal to you?!
Just checking!

17:43.075 --> 17:44.277
Whoa!

17:44.333 --> 17:45.937
That was so not on Web MD.

17:46.071 --> 17:48.471
Wait. Where's Nicole?! She's...

17:48.496 --> 17:51.069
Officer Haught. Excuse me.

17:51.093 --> 17:53.562
- Don't look at me!
- Ooh! Definitely a little naked.

17:54.622 --> 17:57.474
Hey, my phone battery's toast.
I'm guessing the rest of yours are too?

17:57.545 --> 17:59.427
Espresso. Drink.

18:01.122 --> 18:03.253
You can wake people up,
but they fall right back asleep.

18:03.450 --> 18:06.262
- Wha... what's doing it?
- Something that's about to get dead.

18:06.396 --> 18:08.263
It's like a curse or a spell.

18:08.296 --> 18:10.278
I mean, it has to be.
This many people, the radius...

18:10.387 --> 18:12.948
- It's unprecedented.
- Sleeping Beauty on steroids.

18:12.973 --> 18:15.999
Okay, so we double up
and start waking the town?

18:16.335 --> 18:17.514
No. No.

18:17.539 --> 18:20.052
Waking people up makes
it harder to find the source, and..

18:20.238 --> 18:23.239
Whoever's doing this, they'll be easy
to spot if everyone's zonked. Right?

18:23.241 --> 18:25.720
Yeah, and we need something
a little stronger than coffee.

18:26.345 --> 18:28.470
All right, I've got
enough pharmaceuticals

18:28.495 --> 18:30.613
in the evidence locker to keep
all of Purg High buzzing.

18:30.689 --> 18:34.033
Uh, if you snort it or shoot
it, I'm out. So are you.

18:34.353 --> 18:37.612
- My own sister, a narc.
- okay, most of it is not illegal.

18:37.637 --> 18:40.151
When taken by the person
to whom it is prescribed.

18:40.176 --> 18:42.810
Look, if we don't
self-medicate, we're all...

18:43.094 --> 18:44.327
Right.

19:06.514 --> 19:08.685
I forgot my gloves... whoa!

19:08.818 --> 19:10.357
Uh...

19:11.365 --> 19:12.889
Uh...

19:13.295 --> 19:14.657
I... is that?

19:14.966 --> 19:16.993
- Nicole, please.
- okay. This is...

19:17.240 --> 19:21.000
Wow. Okay. Um... let's just...
Does Waverly know?

19:21.099 --> 19:23.906
Yeah... but not Dolls or anyone else.

19:23.999 --> 19:25.093
Yet.

19:25.155 --> 19:26.460
- Okay.
- Yeah.

19:26.517 --> 19:29.753
Uh... Look, I'd still like to do a
loop of the town, I just wanna see

19:29.778 --> 19:32.784
if anyone fell asleep outside
and... and move them, even.

19:32.979 --> 19:35.221
Great plan. Stay alert.

19:35.380 --> 19:38.018
Okay. The keys to the locker,
they're in Nedley's desk drawer.

19:38.043 --> 19:40.243
Okay. Nicole...

19:40.589 --> 19:42.407
Uh, thanks. Thank you.

19:44.353 --> 19:47.046
Heaven help that gynecologist.

19:57.777 --> 19:59.503
I cannot sustain it.

19:59.871 --> 20:02.433
I can't keep the humans all asleep.

20:02.640 --> 20:04.753
Hypnos, darling... Admit it.

20:05.009 --> 20:08.040
- You've missed this.
- Whole town's been asleep for weeks.

20:08.065 --> 20:09.526
This isn't fun anymore.

20:10.026 --> 20:11.948
I want my prize now.

20:12.690 --> 20:15.818
- Shut up, Tucker.
- Time is running out.

20:15.991 --> 20:18.014
That's unacceptable. We need more.

20:18.194 --> 20:21.483
You should accept that you've failed.

20:21.603 --> 20:23.261
You can't hurt her! I like her!

20:23.308 --> 20:25.011
You'll give us another week.

20:25.159 --> 20:26.378
And another week after that,

20:26.403 --> 20:29.008
and another week after that,
for as long as required.

20:29.033 --> 20:31.395
Because you love dear Poppy, don't you?

20:31.538 --> 20:34.029
Couldn't bear it if her pretty face, say...

20:34.458 --> 20:36.404
fell off.

20:36.951 --> 20:38.441
And you. If I hear another word

20:38.443 --> 20:40.588
- about your prize, I will...
- I'm doing good.

20:40.791 --> 20:42.578
I found something in the salt flats.

20:42.831 --> 20:45.058
- The seal.
- No, but...

20:45.083 --> 20:47.383
- Someone's awake!
- Hypnos!

20:47.892 --> 20:49.519
Knock them out.

20:52.857 --> 20:54.681
I can't.

20:55.509 --> 20:57.035
The Heir is too strong.

20:57.219 --> 20:59.028
The heir? What heir?

20:59.101 --> 21:02.289
The Heir of Wyatt Earp.

21:02.400 --> 21:04.171
Never say that name to us!

21:04.259 --> 21:06.259
You haven't been paying attention.

21:06.421 --> 21:09.632
Too caught up in your fruitless mission.

21:09.707 --> 21:12.804
Run! Run, while you still can.

21:12.877 --> 21:14.608
I think we can handle it.

21:14.632 --> 21:17.107
Besides, Beth is hungry, aren't you?

21:17.132 --> 21:19.125
Let's go get you someone to chew on.

21:21.619 --> 21:25.252
All right. So, whatever's doing
this witch, warlock, demon,

21:25.299 --> 21:28.224
it's expending a lot
of energy, so it'll need help.

21:28.226 --> 21:30.293
So someone out there is up and about?

21:30.295 --> 21:32.829
Yeah, and that something
will be easy to find.

21:32.831 --> 21:35.164
Anyone awake? We track 'em.

21:35.166 --> 21:37.633
Wynonna shoots 'em. Boom.

21:37.799 --> 21:39.677
So, why put a whole town to sleep?

21:39.701 --> 21:42.506
I mean, it's not an
assassination attempt. Obvi.

21:42.592 --> 21:45.037
Maybe for the same reason
we're not waking anybody up yet.

21:45.412 --> 21:46.954
Easier to get shit done.

21:47.045 --> 21:50.970
The party's over now.
One at a time, as needed.

21:51.376 --> 21:54.750
Okay? It's just adrenaline. Into the hip.

21:55.946 --> 21:56.880
Won't need it.

21:57.115 --> 22:00.036
Funny story. Peacemaker
has decided it's an alarm clock.

22:00.099 --> 22:02.631
- And a taser.
- Fine. Radios are charged.

22:02.687 --> 22:03.911
Here you go.

22:03.982 --> 22:08.459
Here you go. And no, we are not
doing any cutesy call signs. Okay?

22:08.525 --> 22:10.334
- Fine.
- All right.

22:12.773 --> 22:15.271
Okay, so, um, somebody
needs to wake up Doc,

22:15.273 --> 22:18.513
- and I'd rather if it wasn't me.
- Yeah, I've got it.

22:19.185 --> 22:21.222
Hey, uh... about before,

22:21.270 --> 22:24.537
Wynonna, I...
I didn't mean to, you know,

22:25.456 --> 22:27.550
Uh, so, let us know
the second you get to Shorty's.

22:29.230 --> 22:30.988
There you go.

22:31.062 --> 22:34.935
<i>- Attagirl, Angelpants.
- See you around, BaconDonut.</i>

22:39.930 --> 22:41.515
All right, there's something else.

22:41.603 --> 22:43.290
If the victims of the sleeping spells

22:43.322 --> 22:45.513
stay under too long,
they never wake up again.

22:46.107 --> 22:47.607
Ever.

22:49.483 --> 22:51.522
You feeling okay?

22:53.624 --> 22:56.100
I can't believe I'm about to say this,

22:56.125 --> 22:58.937
but I... I think I need a cup of tea.

22:59.609 --> 23:01.250
Hey. Where's Jeremy?

23:02.147 --> 23:05.077
If he fell asleep on the toilet,
that's all you.

23:11.667 --> 23:13.081
Shalidelle.

23:16.825 --> 23:18.309
Love the veil.

23:18.746 --> 23:21.661
Somebody die or are you just over hats?

23:23.895 --> 23:26.290
Guess the whole sleeping beauty
routine is your doing.

23:26.434 --> 23:28.532
So you could find the second seal.

23:33.618 --> 23:35.343
Speaking of second...

23:38.678 --> 23:40.779
Double double shit ton of trouble.

24:16.005 --> 24:17.380
Doc?

24:20.112 --> 24:21.385
Well...

24:21.603 --> 24:22.909
Someone's been doing yoga.

24:28.705 --> 24:30.971
Hey! Those were for me.

24:32.132 --> 24:34.761
You know what they say,
"You snooze, you shall lose."

24:34.847 --> 24:37.134
You and Rosita weren't snoozing.

24:37.159 --> 24:40.527
I mean, you were. But, you know,
you fell asleep... entwined.

24:40.589 --> 24:42.378
It's a new thing. It's casual.

24:42.620 --> 24:44.164
Of course. No strings, right?

24:44.847 --> 24:47.559
I'm not the settling down type, Waverly.
I never have been.

24:47.584 --> 24:50.553
A fact about which
I've been entirely clear to everyone.

24:50.772 --> 24:53.042
- She's too young for you.
- I'm older than

24:53.044 --> 24:55.155
the state of Colorado.
Everybody's too young for me.

24:55.379 --> 24:58.096
There a reason your sister
didn't come wake me herself?

24:58.715 --> 25:00.432
She and Dolls were gearing up at BBD.

25:00.690 --> 25:02.457
Uh-huh.

25:02.862 --> 25:04.558
Woke up together, I suppose.

25:04.610 --> 25:06.610
Hey! It was just coffee.

25:08.916 --> 25:11.384
Yeah, well, my body's
gonna need something else.

25:11.721 --> 25:13.502
Where do you keep your energy drinks?

25:13.737 --> 25:16.485
Had to hide 'em from Rosita.
She had four in a row,

25:16.510 --> 25:18.935
started seeing some fella
by the name of Elvis.

25:20.983 --> 25:22.250
Jeremy!

25:24.275 --> 25:26.535
Hey! Jeremy!

25:27.144 --> 25:29.175
- Jeremy!
- Oh, God!

25:29.761 --> 25:32.300
The seal. The seal is in Shorty's.

25:34.418 --> 25:37.896
I'm in Shorty's. Um, okay.

25:40.669 --> 25:42.623
Wait! Jeremy, stop.
You'll hurt yourself.

25:42.693 --> 25:45.862
Ooh. Okay. The second seal is back there.

25:45.917 --> 25:49.050
I would bet my signed <i>Baywatch 2017</i> poster

25:49.089 --> 25:50.723
it's behind these stupid,

25:50.785 --> 25:53.137
mother-fudgin' crates!

25:53.405 --> 25:55.605
And what in the hell
gave you that notion?

25:55.740 --> 25:58.435
Shorty's was built in the
same year that they renovated

25:58.467 --> 26:00.357
the church basement, and it sits on top of

26:00.466 --> 26:02.294
what used to be a Masonic Temple.

26:02.817 --> 26:05.381
Holy ground. It fits!

26:11.455 --> 26:13.359
It felt a lot heavier.

26:17.229 --> 26:19.462
I am not putting an appendage
through there.

26:19.464 --> 26:22.098
The last one wasn't, uh,
booby-trapped or anything, right?

26:22.194 --> 26:24.827
Unless you count a spider
demon sucking out your insides.

26:24.903 --> 26:26.749
Kinda, yeah. I do.

26:27.343 --> 26:30.183
What would the Rock do, what would
the Rock do, what would the Rock do?

26:30.607 --> 26:32.943
- Goodness.
- My bet's on badness.

26:38.482 --> 26:40.683
- Earp, you good?
- They're gone.

26:43.488 --> 26:45.318
There was two of 'em.

26:45.613 --> 26:47.467
Damn it, why'd they run? I had 'em,

26:47.588 --> 26:49.787
busy corseted bitches.

26:52.696 --> 26:55.231
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa!

26:56.040 --> 26:58.728
I'm okay. I'm okay.

26:59.212 --> 27:00.489
Yeah, but you're also, like...

27:00.514 --> 27:03.039
Would you believe I ate
a buttload of corndogs?

27:04.667 --> 27:06.888
I'm not seeing things, right?

27:06.990 --> 27:09.842
- Like, you're...
- Knocked up.

27:10.631 --> 27:13.164
Yup. Little bit.

27:22.966 --> 27:26.146
Why don't any of the creepy bad guys
ever just wear jeans?

27:26.872 --> 27:29.325
I was gonna tell you.
I wanted to tell you.

27:29.401 --> 27:32.758
- When? When you were in labour?
- Oh my God, I'm gonna have to do that.

27:32.871 --> 27:34.500
Just, maybe you should sit down, or...

27:34.525 --> 27:37.141
- No, I don't need to sit down.
- okay.

27:40.926 --> 27:42.825
You're pregnant.

27:43.815 --> 27:46.382
Believe it or not,
being pregnant doesn't affect

27:46.384 --> 27:49.189
my ability to send evil shittickets
screaming back to hell.

27:50.064 --> 27:51.728
Nothing's changed.

27:51.753 --> 27:53.589
Everything's changed.

27:53.614 --> 27:55.114
<i>Hey, Wynonna? It's Nicole.</i>

27:55.293 --> 27:57.958
I just tracked a lady in black
to the old Clockmaker's Mansion.

27:58.288 --> 28:00.055
Copy that.

28:01.268 --> 28:05.299
Look, those witchy Widows
supernaturally roofied the entire town.

28:05.463 --> 28:07.322
I'm shooting them in their lacy faces

28:07.347 --> 28:10.445
before they find the second
seal. That's it. I'm doing it.

28:10.562 --> 28:12.656
- It's not an option.
- okay, Deputy.

28:12.844 --> 28:15.999
But we gotta take it careful.
Can't go in hot.

28:18.183 --> 28:20.024
Have you met me?

28:20.289 --> 28:21.884
I'm always hot.

28:37.816 --> 28:39.450
Earp! In here.

28:41.037 --> 28:44.247
I think I just found the source
of your sleeping curse.

28:44.676 --> 28:47.744
A Tempus Monstrum. A Sandman.

28:49.286 --> 28:52.271
- They made me do it.
- Well then, undo it. Wake everybody up.

28:52.296 --> 28:54.033
- I can't.
- Well, I can.

28:54.236 --> 28:56.236
One bullet, straight between the eyes.

28:56.503 --> 28:58.981
Kill me and they all die.

28:59.138 --> 29:01.138
Asleep forever.

29:01.379 --> 29:03.342
Until their bodies rot.

29:08.196 --> 29:11.149
And yes, that includes you three,

29:11.269 --> 29:13.188
or rather... four.

29:14.790 --> 29:16.472
Or is that what you want?

29:18.341 --> 29:19.513
Dolls?

29:19.711 --> 29:22.184
He's right. The spell's irreversible

29:22.239 --> 29:24.817
if the caster dies without lifting it.

29:24.892 --> 29:26.791
They should really put that on the label.

29:26.815 --> 29:28.085
Sorry.

29:28.086 --> 29:31.024
Listen, asshole,
I'm tired, I'm hormonal,

29:31.026 --> 29:33.066
and I have to pee
for the zillionth time today.

29:33.091 --> 29:35.447
Can't shoot to kill? That's fine.

29:35.472 --> 29:37.261
I have other ways to bring the pain.

29:37.699 --> 29:39.339
I'll cooperate.

29:40.573 --> 29:41.866
On one condition.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.950
Goody. I love conditions.
They really turn my crank.

29:47.648 --> 29:51.184
The Widows' human familiar
took my Poppy.

29:53.839 --> 29:55.180
He has

29:56.537 --> 29:57.682
plans.

29:57.717 --> 29:59.131
So, what?

29:59.281 --> 30:01.240
What do you want? You want us to
rescue your little girlfriend?

30:01.295 --> 30:02.691
She's not my girlfriend.

30:03.542 --> 30:05.004
She's my daughter.

30:07.114 --> 30:10.251
- I need to know about the Widows.
- There's no time!

30:14.625 --> 30:17.540
They seem to know me,
but I have no memory of them.

30:17.885 --> 30:19.736
- It's curious.
- What?

30:20.025 --> 30:21.802
They are looking for something.

30:21.985 --> 30:24.505
Yeah, a seal. Old news.
What happens when they break it?

30:24.588 --> 30:26.255
I assume nothing yet,

30:26.504 --> 30:29.105
given that there are three in total.

30:29.677 --> 30:30.951
Three seals?

30:30.975 --> 30:33.105
They're not looking
for the second one anymore.

30:33.130 --> 30:34.959
They found it.

30:36.877 --> 30:38.811
Shorty's.

30:41.734 --> 30:44.589
I like these. I like these a lot.

30:44.614 --> 30:46.141
I'm feeling all tingly.

30:46.427 --> 30:48.138
We can talk about that later.

30:48.528 --> 30:50.042
Angelpants to BaconDonut.

30:50.135 --> 30:52.268
Come in, Wynonna.

30:52.698 --> 30:55.051
Say again, you're breaking up.

30:55.112 --> 30:57.745
- Over.
- <i>Waverly, leave now!</i>

30:57.898 --> 31:01.289
<i>It's the women in black.
The seal's in Shorty's. They know.</i>

31:01.892 --> 31:04.649
Too late. I think she's already here.

31:06.460 --> 31:07.888
Three against one, gents,

31:08.022 --> 31:09.356
even if she does get through that door!

31:09.381 --> 31:11.700
I failed my firearms test four times!

31:11.724 --> 31:13.002
Okay.

31:15.389 --> 31:18.116
May be the liquor, but I see two.

31:49.744 --> 31:51.290
<i>Yummy yummy.</i>

31:51.382 --> 31:53.494
<i>This one smells sweet.</i>

31:53.592 --> 31:56.431
<i>First the seal. Then the snacks.</i>

31:58.792 --> 32:00.592
Tell me I'm wearing clothes this time.

32:00.617 --> 32:02.089
- Mm-hmm.
- Huh!

32:02.722 --> 32:05.654
- Waverly's in trouble.
- Yeah. But I need you to find

32:05.656 --> 32:07.956
someone else, Haught,
or the whole town dies.

32:08.037 --> 32:10.044
I'll save my sister. You know I will.

32:10.122 --> 32:11.833
Okay. Where am I going?

32:11.857 --> 32:15.081
Okay, we somehow have to find
this psycho named Tucker.

32:15.185 --> 32:16.903
Tucker Gardiner?

32:17.208 --> 32:19.334
I've been tracking his phone for weeks.

32:22.358 --> 32:25.279
Tucker's had all my instincts
buzzing since day one.

32:25.317 --> 32:27.316
You bugged his phone?
Isn't that illegal?

32:27.380 --> 32:28.287
Very illegal.

32:28.312 --> 32:30.845
Hey! In my defence, he is
the worst! Don't judge me.

32:30.945 --> 32:32.421
I will judge you.

32:32.500 --> 32:34.632
Judge you unexpectedly awesome.

32:35.062 --> 32:36.885
Okay. It looks like he's headed to...

32:36.910 --> 32:38.106
The homestead.

32:39.926 --> 32:41.855
- Dolls?
- Yeah.

32:41.996 --> 32:43.937
- I need you to go with her.
- No, no, no, no.

32:43.994 --> 32:45.832
Not a chance. And leave
you alone? Not happening.

32:45.887 --> 32:48.006
If something happened
to Nicole, Waverly would die.

32:48.066 --> 32:49.967
And I just got her back.

32:51.100 --> 32:53.334
- Plus Doc's...
- Yeah.

32:53.708 --> 32:56.188
It's just, I need to talk to Doc.

33:11.134 --> 33:12.674
You're amazing.

33:14.557 --> 33:16.885
You're just...

33:18.603 --> 33:20.284
You're an amazing agent...

33:20.994 --> 33:23.525
Earp. Just an amazing agent.

33:26.931 --> 33:28.572
Thank you.

34:19.437 --> 34:21.322
Okay, wait. Wait!

34:21.324 --> 34:22.648
Wait, wait, wait!

34:37.639 --> 34:38.842
No.

34:38.951 --> 34:41.114
Waverly would brush her hair slowly.

34:41.186 --> 34:42.389
Elegantly.

34:42.714 --> 34:45.733
- I'm not Waverly.
- Undress and put this on.

34:47.688 --> 34:49.891
It'll help you get into character.

34:57.105 --> 34:59.941
- Shit... I'm sorry.
- Help!

35:00.213 --> 35:03.183
- He is not in her room!
- Go! Go!

35:03.292 --> 35:06.882
- I don't... I don't want to...
- Hands on your head! Now!

35:07.406 --> 35:10.874
You hurt her, it's all over, man.
It's not just a couple upskirts.

35:10.937 --> 35:12.773
You do not want to cross that line.

35:12.829 --> 35:15.335
Everyone keeps talking to me
like I'm an idiot:

35:15.601 --> 35:17.653
Those hags, this one here, you.

35:17.800 --> 35:20.137
I'm not an idiot. I know what I'm doing.

35:20.879 --> 35:22.395
I know what I want.

35:24.777 --> 35:26.707
Too bad you're not gonna get it.

35:31.413 --> 35:33.005
You shot me, you bitch.

35:33.030 --> 35:34.888
Drop the knife or I'll do it again.

35:35.701 --> 35:36.854
I did something else.

35:37.471 --> 35:38.995
They'll kill me for it.

35:40.256 --> 35:41.484
Tucker!

35:44.960 --> 35:47.060
Let's get you home to your dad, okay?

35:51.317 --> 35:52.926
<i>It worked.</i>

35:54.702 --> 35:57.646
Hey, drama queens.
You break it, you bite it!

36:02.094 --> 36:04.237
Don't do that to me, baby girl.

36:07.424 --> 36:09.327
Sleeping on the job again?

36:09.616 --> 36:13.155
Oh, I like to let you
get in a few from time to time.

36:13.233 --> 36:14.778
Builds your confidence.

36:16.285 --> 36:18.676
Everyone's okay. No permanent damage.

36:19.300 --> 36:21.590
Even your hat survived.

36:24.462 --> 36:26.439
I have something to tell you, Doc.

36:38.790 --> 36:40.622
I wanted you to hear it from me.

36:45.216 --> 36:48.684
I do believe
folks are waking up upstairs.

36:52.886 --> 36:54.316
They'll be thirsty.

37:10.010 --> 37:12.299
No one seems to have even
noticed they lost a whole month.

37:12.743 --> 37:14.376
Because they haven't.

37:15.152 --> 37:16.704
Check your telephone.

37:20.666 --> 37:22.543
It's the same date
as when I fell asleep.

37:22.697 --> 37:24.158
In a dream,

37:24.280 --> 37:27.103
it can feel as though
hours and hours have passed,

37:27.548 --> 37:30.328
but then you wake to find out
you've only slept for a minute.

37:31.742 --> 37:35.468
No one in Purgatory will
even realize time has passed...

37:35.851 --> 37:37.226
because in fact,

37:37.945 --> 37:40.187
- it hasn't.
- Buddy.

37:40.734 --> 37:42.577
Sure seems like time has passed for me.

37:42.718 --> 37:45.288
Under my influence, bodies cease to age.

37:45.913 --> 37:48.338
Your child should have stayed as it was.

37:48.756 --> 37:50.682
So what you're saying is I got screwed.

37:51.058 --> 37:52.916
That much is obvious.

37:53.827 --> 37:55.814
You refuse to follow the rules.

37:55.903 --> 37:59.326
It seems your offspring
will be the same.

38:01.636 --> 38:03.560
But you saved my daughter.

38:05.103 --> 38:07.062
I want to see her now.

38:08.244 --> 38:09.963
I'm harmless when dormant.

38:10.167 --> 38:11.979
I'll go back into hibernation.

38:14.838 --> 38:17.096
- Something like that.
- Dolls!

38:17.167 --> 38:19.065
He was blackmailed. They used him!

38:19.097 --> 38:21.498
And if he's used again?
He's a goddamn demon, Earp.

38:21.593 --> 38:23.793
And a powerful one. Now do your job.

38:25.035 --> 38:26.370
Now.

38:33.800 --> 38:35.685
You don't have to be like this, Dolls.

38:35.763 --> 38:37.607
Like what, your Boss?

38:37.915 --> 38:40.464
What else am I supposed
to do around here, Earp?

38:44.284 --> 38:47.182
Waves, let's go.

38:47.603 --> 38:49.401
Poppy took off.

38:49.852 --> 38:51.364
We didn't stop her.

38:52.272 --> 38:53.997
She's not the enemy.

38:56.387 --> 38:57.941
- Hey, Earp. Earp.
- Wynonna.

38:57.966 --> 38:59.825
- Earp!
- Wait. Whoa.

39:01.087 --> 39:03.202
You know we're gonna have to talk
about this eventually, right?

39:04.155 --> 39:05.781
Put a strategy in place.

39:05.874 --> 39:09.133
Until then, she gets
all the time and space...

39:09.312 --> 39:11.906
- that she needs.
- I wonder if you could, uh...

39:12.070 --> 39:13.648
give her this.

39:14.150 --> 39:15.788
When you think she's ready.

39:22.265 --> 39:23.851
What's the down low?

39:24.288 --> 39:26.468
- Wynonna's pregnant.
- Yeah!

39:27.812 --> 39:29.781
Oh, was that a secret?

39:31.242 --> 39:32.741
You're injured.

39:32.810 --> 39:34.670
- That's no ordinary gun.
- You'll heal.

39:34.695 --> 39:35.999
I'll get you something to feed on.

39:36.039 --> 39:38.022
That Earp girl knows too much.

39:38.201 --> 39:40.096
She'll be coming.

39:58.986 --> 40:00.797
Sister Clootie!

40:06.250 --> 40:08.182
- Constance!
- He killed the Stone Witch!

40:08.206 --> 40:09.455
That little Tucker is dead.

40:17.268 --> 40:20.276
Don't laugh. This is the only
position I feel comfortable in.

40:21.509 --> 40:23.299
Room down there for one more?

40:32.787 --> 40:34.092
You okay?

40:34.508 --> 40:35.990
No.

40:37.483 --> 40:38.632
Furious.

40:40.390 --> 40:41.927
These things just happen.

40:41.952 --> 40:43.249
No.

40:43.569 --> 40:44.850
Not to me.

40:46.454 --> 40:49.501
Am I a screw-up? Yeah.

40:50.763 --> 40:54.115
I've also been on two types of birth
control since I was 13 years old.

40:54.310 --> 40:56.060
But the universe doesn't give a damn.

40:56.365 --> 40:58.841
It's never given me
a choice, it's never...

41:02.598 --> 41:05.446
not whether I wanted to
be the Heir or a m...

41:08.782 --> 41:10.555
a mother.

41:10.952 --> 41:12.937
I know you're overwhelmed, okay?

41:13.000 --> 41:15.928
But not everything
is because you're an Earp.

41:16.008 --> 41:17.492
Yeah, it is.

41:19.875 --> 41:22.930
It always comes back to the curse,
Wave, always.

41:26.973 --> 41:28.915
I really, I...

41:30.884 --> 41:32.493
I can't do this.

41:33.197 --> 41:34.548
- Hey.
- No.

41:35.431 --> 41:37.824
- Hey.
- This poor asshole!

41:38.252 --> 41:40.105
Hey...

41:46.277 --> 41:47.950
I'm not saying

41:48.115 --> 41:49.919
it's gonna be okay.

41:50.435 --> 41:52.411
But I'm just saying...

41:55.489 --> 41:56.761
I'm here.

42:04.736 --> 42:06.737
And Doc wanted me to give you this.

42:16.201 --> 42:17.995
