Ms. Stone.

29:09.915 --> 29:11.167
-[Jennifer] Hi.
-[principal] She works with

29:11.333 --> 29:14.003
the district
as a school psychologist.

29:15.171 --> 29:16.380
Uh, sorry we kept you waiting.

29:16.547 --> 29:18.132
[Jack] Uh, no worries at all.

29:18.299 --> 29:22.219
The amount of time I spent
in this here office as a boy

29:22.344 --> 29:24.430
makes me nostalgic to be back.

29:24.555 --> 29:26.015
[chuckles] Usually,
the principal's office

29:26.182 --> 29:27.766
brings up scary memories.

29:27.933 --> 29:29.852
I hope you weren't
a troublemaker, Mr. Spade.

29:30.019 --> 29:32.021
Well, I didn't
necessarily make any trouble--

29:32.188 --> 29:34.732
didn't shy away from it
when it found me,

29:34.857 --> 29:36.692
certainly wasn't scared of it.

29:36.817 --> 29:39.612
Violence sometimes suggests
a deeper issue going on

29:39.778 --> 29:43.741
with a child, and the proximity
to professional wrestling

29:43.908 --> 29:45.701
may even normalize it.

29:45.868 --> 29:47.912
It's boys.
We handled it at home.

29:48.078 --> 29:49.914
Tell us.
We're concerned.

29:50.039 --> 29:52.082
No need for a concern.
It's handled.

29:52.249 --> 29:54.960
Thomas understands he can't use
his fists to express himself.

29:55.127 --> 29:56.462
Well, not at school, anyways.

29:56.629 --> 29:58.088
School, their rules.

29:58.255 --> 30:00.049
School rules say you can't
defend yourself that way.

30:00.216 --> 30:01.550
Noted.

30:01.717 --> 30:03.636
There's no need
for a deeper dive.

30:03.761 --> 30:06.430
Okay, well, the video evidence
of the incident

30:06.597 --> 30:07.848
might amend
your feelings about it.

30:08.015 --> 30:09.975
[Jack]
You got any audio evidence?

30:10.142 --> 30:13.479
Audio evidence
would amend your feelings,

30:13.646 --> 30:15.314
because audio evidence would

30:15.481 --> 30:17.650
reveal what provoked Thomas
that day.

30:17.816 --> 30:19.568
Thomas broke the boy's nose.

30:19.735 --> 30:23.781
We want to make every effort
to de-escalate the situation.

30:23.906 --> 30:25.199
I-I-It's over.

30:25.324 --> 30:27.326
It's de-escalated.
[scoffs]

30:27.451 --> 30:28.410
You think this is funny?

30:28.577 --> 30:29.912
No, I don't.

30:30.079 --> 30:33.457
But I was just recalling
when I was in fifth grade here.

30:33.624 --> 30:35.334
A kid named Dave Curley

30:35.501 --> 30:38.712
pulled down Becky Colquit's
pants at recess.

30:38.837 --> 30:40.798
Becky's brother, Todd,
stepped up.

30:40.965 --> 30:42.424
He broke Dave's nose,

30:42.591 --> 30:44.510
and then he broke
Dave's left arm.

30:44.635 --> 30:49.223
And Dave learned something
that day about bullying.

30:49.390 --> 30:50.641
Now, guess what?

30:50.808 --> 30:52.643
Dave turned into
a pretty good guy.

30:52.810 --> 30:55.020
He's working as a social worker
now up in Raleigh.

30:55.145 --> 30:56.438
Thomas is a sensitive boy,

30:56.605 --> 30:58.691
who responded in a way
we don't prefer.

30:58.857 --> 31:01.777
Thomas got told
to go fuck himself.

31:01.944 --> 31:03.445
That's bullying.

31:04.947 --> 31:07.533
Thomas taught that bully
a life lesson

31:07.700 --> 31:10.494
about using threats
and fightin' words.

31:10.661 --> 31:11.787
[principal]
There's no such thing

31:11.954 --> 31:13.497
as fighting words, Mr. Spade.

31:13.664 --> 31:16.208
Fighting words escalate
into a school shooting,

31:16.375 --> 31:17.710
and you don't want that,
do you?

31:19.503 --> 31:21.797
Did you just ask me
if I wanted this to escalate

31:21.964 --> 31:23.132
to a school shootin'?

31:23.299 --> 31:24.258
I did.

31:25.718 --> 31:29.763
Until Congress legislates an
approved list of fighting words

31:29.930 --> 31:34.184
that justifiably
provoke physical retribution,

31:34.351 --> 31:37.062
we're just gonna draw the line
at no punching,

31:37.229 --> 31:39.857
no kicking, no scratching,
no pulling hair too,

31:40.024 --> 31:42.693
but top on the list
is no punching.

31:42.860 --> 31:44.236
Make sense?

31:44.403 --> 31:45.571
Totally. Completely.

31:51.910 --> 31:53.787
Well, mission accomplished.

31:53.954 --> 31:56.206
That was one of
the worst routes ever taken

31:56.373 --> 31:58.167
to accomplish any mission ever.

31:58.334 --> 31:59.835
It's a miracle
we got out of that meetin'

32:00.002 --> 32:02.004
with them agreein'
to let Thomas back in school.

32:02.129 --> 32:04.632
Well, Staci, it's over and done
with, and he's unsuspended,

32:04.757 --> 32:06.425
so what is the deal
for tonight?

32:06.592 --> 32:08.093
You gon' drive to Alpharetta,
grab Thomas,

32:08.260 --> 32:10.304
and just come on back,
'cause that's a--

32:12.723 --> 32:16.185
That's a lot of driving
for one day.

32:16.352 --> 32:18.020
I don't even know what to s--

32:18.187 --> 32:20.522
[Jack]
Staci, I came to the meetin'.

32:20.689 --> 32:23.192
Me, it's Jack.
It's my point of view.

32:23.317 --> 32:24.902
I figure since
we were invited--

32:25.027 --> 32:26.528
Summoned.
We were summoned.

32:26.695 --> 32:29.281
They had the district
school psychologist there.

32:29.448 --> 32:31.533
This wasn't a meetin'
about detention and writin'

32:31.659 --> 32:33.285
"I'm sorry for punching"
200 times.

32:33.452 --> 32:35.537
They think our son might
have mental health issues.

32:35.704 --> 32:36.580
[Jack] They...
[sighs]

32:36.747 --> 32:37.915
They're concerned

32:38.082 --> 32:39.416
that the school district's
gonna get sued.

32:39.541 --> 32:41.085
They're just tryin'
to cover their ass.

32:41.210 --> 32:42.878
They wanted us to acknowledge
punching as wrong.

32:43.045 --> 32:44.463
How could you not read that?

32:44.588 --> 32:46.548
'Cause punchin'
is not always wrong.

32:46.715 --> 32:48.634
Listen, are we supposed to live
according to principle,

32:48.801 --> 32:50.219
or we just supposed
to suck it up?

32:50.386 --> 32:51.845
We're supposed to live
according to principle

32:52.012 --> 32:53.222
and common sense.

32:53.389 --> 32:56.100
Well, let me know
when to use which.

32:57.351 --> 32:59.728
And hey, how- how is it that
I'm here talkin' 'bout Thomas,

32:59.895 --> 33:01.522
and you're clearly
tryin' to talk about me?

33:01.689 --> 33:02.898
No, I'm talkin' about
all of us.

33:03.065 --> 33:04.108
This is exactly my point.

33:04.274 --> 33:05.734
I think
we're doin' this together,

33:05.901 --> 33:09.113
and then you go rogue,
arguing about fighting words.

33:09.238 --> 33:11.031
No, goin' rogue's fightin'

33:11.198 --> 33:12.991
in the absence
of fightin' words.

33:14.618 --> 33:16.078
Those people
have master's degrees.

33:16.203 --> 33:17.871
If they think we should
reframe our son's behavior,

33:17.996 --> 33:19.748
maybe we should just listen.

33:19.915 --> 33:22.584
I listened,
then I responded.

33:22.751 --> 33:25.254
You talked.
You schooled the school people.

33:25.421 --> 33:26.630
What the hell, man?

33:26.797 --> 33:28.674
You have one gear lately--
confrontational.

33:28.841 --> 33:30.342
I was in there
defendin' our son,

33:30.509 --> 33:31.635

mental health issues--

33:31.802 --> 33:33.470
[sighs]
I don't wanna argue.

33:39.768 --> 33:41.103
I just wanna hold your hand

33:44.523 --> 33:45.774

33:45.941 --> 33:47.359

anyone observin' us

33:47.526 --> 33:50.112
and thinking,
"Wow, what a great marriage."

33:52.114 --> 33:54.867
But it's what I want.

33:55.033 --> 33:57.786

we're gonna treat a--

Stop provoking me.
I wasn't going--

34:14.636 --> 34:17.014

I told Ace the truth.

I'm here at this meetin'

34:19.308 --> 34:21.685

that our son is a bully,

34:21.852 --> 34:23.437
which is not true.

34:23.604 --> 34:26.023
I conceded the point.
I did not think it true,

34:26.189 --> 34:29.818
but I did for you,
for Thomas, for us.

34:52.299 --> 34:53.550
-Don't say it's conditional.
-That's fine.
