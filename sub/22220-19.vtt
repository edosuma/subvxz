WEBVTT

00:02.837 --> 00:05.169
(grunting)

00:13.681 --> 00:15.262
Here you are.

00:19.770 --> 00:21.761
(gasping)

00:21.856 --> 00:23.471
You sure you should
be exercising?

00:23.566 --> 00:24.897
Why not?

00:24.984 --> 00:27.145
Well, 'cause a little while ago
a commando skewered you

00:27.236 --> 00:29.147
with his Swiss Peacekeeper
army knife.

00:29.238 --> 00:31.194
The muscles are
completely healed.

00:31.282 --> 00:32.988
Do you want something?

00:33.075 --> 00:36.158
Yeah. Your Comm's on the blink.
We called you three times for
dinner.

00:36.245 --> 00:37.655
Not hungry.

00:37.747 --> 00:40.614
No? Next time answer.
It's kind of rude not to reply.

00:40.708 --> 00:42.369
Leave me alone!

00:42.460 --> 00:45.122
Yeah, sure.

00:47.131 --> 00:50.419
As soon as you tell me
what the problem is.

01:03.439 --> 01:05.805
Hell, Aeryn, what is that?

01:05.900 --> 01:07.310
(groaning)

01:11.405 --> 01:14.067
You're ice cold.

01:14.158 --> 01:17.321
All right, knock off the
completely healed crap
and talk to me.

01:17.411 --> 01:20.244
Better yet, we'll talk to
Zhaan. Closest thing we
got to a doctor.

01:20.331 --> 01:21.571
No, don't summon the others.

01:21.666 --> 01:23.452
Just let me get to my Prowler.

01:23.542 --> 01:26.158
Your Prowler?

01:26.254 --> 01:29.917
What, you going to go for a
drive? Last I heard, we
weren't within Prowler...

01:36.389 --> 01:38.345
No, you are not going to die.

01:39.850 --> 01:43.684
ldidn't lie to you.
My muscles are healed.

01:43.771 --> 01:46.262
But that knife must have
pierced my paraphoral nerve.

01:46.357 --> 01:49.645
And once that is damaged,
it doesn't regenerate.

01:49.735 --> 01:55.275
80 within fifty or sixty arns,
it's going to fail, and
lam going to die.

01:55.366 --> 01:57.573
There's nothing you
can do about it.

02:00.454 --> 02:02.160
There's something we can do.

02:02.248 --> 02:05.991
The only treatment is a tissue
graft from a genetically
compatible donor.

02:06.085 --> 02:09.828
Fine. We'll find someone.
We've got, what, two,
three days?

02:09.922 --> 02:13.790
At best. And we're nowhere
near a Sebacean colony.

02:13.884 --> 02:17.342
(Aeryn groaning and panting )

02:17.430 --> 02:21.173
But we are near a
Peacekeeperbase.

02:21.267 --> 02:25.636
Less than twenty arns and those
commandoes were kind enough
to leave the address.

02:30.568 --> 02:33.184
You aren't just fahrbot;
you're magra-fahrbot.

02:33.279 --> 02:34.985
I did it before;
I can do it again.

02:35.072 --> 02:37.324
Yeah. By the skin of
your mivonks.

02:37.408 --> 02:41.993
Rygel:
Your masquerade as a Peacekeeper
fooled four battle weary commandos briefly.

02:42.079 --> 02:47.324
lnfiltrating a top-secret
Gammak Base is quite another
matter though, John.

02:47.418 --> 02:50.660
D'Argo:
When you get inside the base
you'll have to find a tissue match.

02:50.755 --> 02:52.666
And obtain a tissue sample.

02:52.757 --> 02:55.339
Rygel:
If he's found out we're
all put at risk.

02:55.426 --> 02:59.385
Will Moya be able to get us out
of here with her pregnancy
so far advanced?

03:00.389 --> 03:02.220
So what are we saying here?

03:03.309 --> 03:04.389
We do nothing?

03:04.477 --> 03:07.014
We let Aeryn die?

03:09.565 --> 03:11.351
ls everybody happy with that?

03:12.526 --> 03:14.608
No, John.

03:15.780 --> 03:18.112
I do not want Aeryn to die.

03:18.199 --> 03:20.815
Zhaan:
Nor do |.

03:20.910 --> 03:23.276
Well you could've fooled me.

03:25.831 --> 03:27.207
What about you, Guido?

03:27.291 --> 03:28.497
How do you feel about this?

03:28.584 --> 03:32.418
Look, what's the difference
what we want?

03:32.505 --> 03:34.416
She is dying.

03:34.507 --> 03:37.249
We must face reality here.

03:37.343 --> 03:39.959
The only sensible course
of action is...

03:40.054 --> 03:43.262
Crichton:
I'm sorry, Sparky.

03:43.349 --> 03:45.681
What were you saying?

03:45.768 --> 03:50.512
Is to do everything in our
power to save Aeryn's life.

03:53.609 --> 03:55.395
Right.

03:57.071 --> 04:00.404
Even though it's likely
to get us killed.

04:04.203 --> 04:06.444
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut...

04:06.539 --> 04:09.872
...a radiation wave hit and I
got shot through a wormhole...

04:09.959 --> 04:12.450
Now I'm lost in some distant
part of the universe on a ship.

04:12.545 --> 04:16.254
A living ship full of strange
alien life-forms...

04:16.340 --> 04:17.125
Help me...

04:17.216 --> 04:18.501
Listen, please.

04:18.592 --> 04:20.583
Is there anybody out there
who can hear me?

04:20.678 --> 04:24.762
...being hunted by an insane
military commander...

04:24.849 --> 04:27.306
...doing everything I can...

04:27.393 --> 04:29.554
I'm just looking for
a way home.

04:48.998 --> 04:51.114
(coughing)

04:56.589 --> 04:58.875
This mission is foolhardy,
Crichton.

04:58.966 --> 05:01.298
It makes no sense for you
to be killed as well.

05:01.385 --> 05:02.966
Let's just cut our losses.

05:03.053 --> 05:06.966
Drop the martyr routine, Aeryn.
I'm not going to let you die.

05:07.057 --> 05:11.346
Pilot:
Crichton, we have reached the
designated coordinates.

05:11.437 --> 05:14.019
Thank you, Pilot.

05:14.106 --> 05:17.769
Do humans have some sort of
ritual for occasions like these?

05:19.778 --> 05:21.860
Well, there's the handshake.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.985
Followed by "good luck."

05:32.708 --> 05:34.790
Good luck.

05:36.253 --> 05:38.369
How was that?

05:38.464 --> 05:40.125
Perfect.

05:41.675 --> 05:43.211
( sniffles )

05:56.232 --> 06:02.979
Pilot:
The planet is an uninhabitable
gas giant, but it has a large moon on the far side.

06:03.072 --> 06:05.313
Large enough to have an
atmosphere, Pilot?

06:05.407 --> 06:08.444
Yes. The base must be
located there.

06:08.536 --> 06:13.121
In this orbit, the planet's
huge mass will shield us
from it completely.

06:13.207 --> 06:18.076
(electronic beeping )

06:23.676 --> 06:27.043
Hey, got to love a man
in a uniform.

06:27.137 --> 06:30.925
Yeah? Well, I love a
girl in gray.

06:31.016 --> 06:32.176
Traveling outfit.

06:32.268 --> 06:34.600
Yeah? You going somewhere?

06:34.687 --> 06:36.177
With you.

06:36.855 --> 06:38.356
Think again.

06:38.440 --> 06:40.351
I'll think out loud.

06:40.442 --> 06:45.152
What you need on this jaunt is
a talented burglar and
destruction causer.

06:45.239 --> 06:46.900
You're volunteering?

06:53.205 --> 06:55.241
What's the angle?

06:55.332 --> 06:57.323
I want to earn my keep
aboard this boat.

06:57.418 --> 07:00.034
You? No. I don't think so.

07:01.630 --> 07:03.871
At least take this.

07:05.926 --> 07:08.167
Peacekeeper ldent Chip.

07:08.262 --> 07:11.095
Maximum security clearance.

07:11.724 --> 07:13.680
This is Larraq's.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.632
How'd you get this?

07:15.728 --> 07:18.014
Told you l was talented.

07:20.566 --> 07:22.648
All right, fine.

07:22.735 --> 07:24.726
I could use the help.

07:31.619 --> 07:34.201
If you're going to help.

07:42.212 --> 07:45.545
We'll pull the same routine
we pulled on those
Marauder commandos.

07:45.633 --> 07:49.376
You're the boss man and I'm
your meek little server.

07:50.721 --> 07:53.178
Sure you don't want me
to fly this thing?

07:53.265 --> 07:54.345
You know how?

07:54.433 --> 07:56.389
Yeah. Do you?

07:56.477 --> 07:57.808
Oh, yeah.

07:57.895 --> 08:00.102
You should see my lmmelmann.

08:00.189 --> 08:01.520
Check this out.

08:02.816 --> 08:05.193
Chiana:
Looks like some kind of
mining complex.

08:05.277 --> 08:07.188
Maybe a refinery?

08:07.279 --> 08:09.611
Looks like it's been nuked.

08:09.698 --> 08:12.656
Long time ago, big time.

08:12.743 --> 08:15.155
Could be camouflage.
Could be dead.

08:15.245 --> 08:18.203
Ah, it's not dead.

08:18.290 --> 08:21.874
Eight targeting systems have
just looked onto us.

08:21.960 --> 08:24.542
Typical warm Peacekeeper
welcome.

08:25.631 --> 08:27.041
(electronic warbling )

08:27.132 --> 08:28.338
Prowler to Gammak Base.

08:28.425 --> 08:30.211
What's with the weapons
locks, you idiots?

08:30.302 --> 08:32.714
Can't you tell a friend
from a foe?

08:32.805 --> 08:34.636
Heskon:
Prowler, identify yourself.

08:34.723 --> 08:37.214
On an open channel?
ldon't think so.

08:37.309 --> 08:39.686
You want to count my teeth,
do it after I land.

08:39.770 --> 08:43.228
The channel is secure. If you
don't identify yourself,
we will...

08:43.315 --> 08:46.182
You'll what? Shoot me down?

08:46.276 --> 08:49.234
It's not a good idea to
gun down a superior officer

08:49.321 --> 08:52.279
without first checking
his ldent Chip.

08:55.285 --> 08:57.992
Prowler, you have a
landing vector.

08:58.080 --> 09:00.446
Crichton:
Thank you so much.

09:00.541 --> 09:03.999
You're not completely
untalented yourself.

09:04.086 --> 09:06.543
Thank you so much.

09:59.391 --> 10:02.633
l'm Tollona Javio,
Commander of this base.

10:02.728 --> 10:04.639
This is Lieutenant Heskon.

10:04.730 --> 10:06.266
And you would be?

10:07.024 --> 10:08.764
Larraq.

10:09.359 --> 10:11.145
Captain.

10:11.236 --> 10:14.273
And don't even think of asking
what my assignment is.

10:14.364 --> 10:15.524
lwouldn't dream of it, Captain.

10:15.616 --> 10:18.858
But we do need to see
your ldent Chip.

10:32.841 --> 10:34.672
(electronic warbling )

10:36.762 --> 10:39.253
ldent Chip verified, sir.

10:39.765 --> 10:41.005
Satisfied?

10:41.099 --> 10:43.135
Delighted to have you
with us, Captain.

10:43.227 --> 10:47.345
Though I am wondering how you
knew this base was here.

10:47.439 --> 10:49.179
Keep wondering.

10:49.274 --> 10:52.858
I'll need quarters for myself
and for my personal server.

10:52.945 --> 10:54.276
Your...?

10:56.949 --> 11:01.864
Larraq, make sure the quarters
are comfortably cool.

11:03.747 --> 11:06.830
It's hot in here.

11:06.917 --> 11:08.407
You brought a civilian with you.

11:08.502 --> 11:10.663
You're getting nosy.

11:13.257 --> 11:15.919
Just admiring your taste.

11:16.009 --> 11:20.002
May I offer food and drink to
you and your server?

11:20.097 --> 11:22.964
I'd love some refreshment.

11:32.484 --> 11:36.193
Chiana:
Hmm, I could get real
fond of this place.

11:36.280 --> 11:39.943
The raslak is good and strong.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.534
Heskon:
Is that how you like it?

11:41.618 --> 11:45.327
Mmm, strong and hot.

11:45.414 --> 11:48.121
Makes the mouth tingle.

11:48.208 --> 11:54.374
Help it go down smooth and slow.

11:54.464 --> 11:58.298
I've never seen a species
quite like hers.

11:58.385 --> 12:01.092
Males outnumber females here?

12:01.972 --> 12:04.213
Five to one?

12:05.225 --> 12:07.386
What do you poor guys
do for fun?

12:07.477 --> 12:10.219
( chuckling )
Not very much.

12:12.149 --> 12:16.438
Well, I'd say I got
here just in time.

12:16.528 --> 12:18.314
What did you pay for her?

12:19.531 --> 12:21.487
You don't want to know.

12:22.534 --> 12:24.274
Does she give good...

12:24.369 --> 12:25.654
value?

12:25.746 --> 12:27.532
She has her moments.

12:41.720 --> 12:43.256
Excuse me, Captain.

12:43.347 --> 12:45.178
Duty calls.

12:52.314 --> 12:54.350
So...

12:54.441 --> 12:56.147
l'm...

12:57.194 --> 12:59.185
Chiana! Frontl

13:06.787 --> 13:08.277
What the hell are you doing?

13:08.372 --> 13:10.954
You acting like a trollop was
not part of the plan.

13:11.041 --> 13:12.702
They bought it, didn't they?

13:12.793 --> 13:15.956
You're drawing a lot
of attention.

13:16.046 --> 13:20.881
The more they look at me,
the less they look at you.

13:22.427 --> 13:26.340
Do you think that before they
elect you centerfold
of the year,

13:26.431 --> 13:30.049
we could get on with the
business of saving Aeryn?

13:30.143 --> 13:32.054
( breathless sigh )

13:33.855 --> 13:37.848
Your quarters have been
assigned. Level four,
number six lerg five.

13:37.943 --> 13:40.605
You're so helpful.

13:41.738 --> 13:43.524
I'll need your ldent Chip, sir.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.156
Again?

13:58.380 --> 13:59.995
(electronic warbling )

14:02.342 --> 14:05.254
If you would place your hand in
here thank you, Captain.

14:06.722 --> 14:09.509
You know who we are.
Let us past.

14:09.599 --> 14:12.762
Sir, everything beyond this
point is Security Three Velka.

14:12.853 --> 14:14.935
Genetic verification required.

14:15.022 --> 14:17.479
Chiana:
Is this really necessary?

14:17.566 --> 14:20.433
Larraq gets so impatient
with delays.

14:20.527 --> 14:24.019
Captain, I must ask you to
place your hand in the device.

14:24.114 --> 14:27.322
And I must ask you, Lieutenant,
who are you to give me orders?

14:27.409 --> 14:30.367
I can give you orders because
I'm a Chief Security Officer,
Captain.

14:30.454 --> 14:33.662
Not for long, if this is how you
treat your superior officers.

14:33.749 --> 14:35.705
You will comply, Captain.

15:01.234 --> 15:03.270
Computer:
Analyzing.

15:10.410 --> 15:13.447
( beeping )

15:13.538 --> 15:15.620
Computer:
Genetic scan verified.

15:21.296 --> 15:23.582
Satisfied?

15:24.549 --> 15:26.585
He's only doing his job.

15:26.676 --> 15:30.919
Let's get to our quarters
so I can do mine.

15:31.807 --> 15:34.014
Crichton:
Well, I am for that.

15:34.101 --> 15:35.762
I'll take you there immediately.

15:35.852 --> 15:38.264
Six lerg five.
I'll find it myself.

15:38.355 --> 15:40.016
Yes, sir.

15:46.738 --> 15:48.444
How the hell did we get
away with that?

15:48.532 --> 15:50.318
Did you do something
to the chip?

15:50.408 --> 15:52.399
(Woman whispers )
Larraq.

16:19.437 --> 16:20.597
John.

16:23.942 --> 16:25.352
Gilina.

16:26.444 --> 16:27.854
What are you doing here?

16:27.946 --> 16:29.231
ls Crais here?

16:29.322 --> 16:31.358
No.

16:31.449 --> 16:34.532
I've been assigned to a new
development project here.

16:35.537 --> 16:36.993
To do what?

16:37.956 --> 16:39.537
They haven't told us.

16:39.624 --> 16:42.787
I assume it's something to do
with developing weaponry
of some kind.

16:46.256 --> 16:48.963
New weapons?

16:49.050 --> 16:52.918
In Peacekeeper hands?
Yeah, just what this
galaxy needs.

16:53.013 --> 16:56.301
It's okay. She's a friend.

17:01.688 --> 17:03.269
How did you know I was here?

17:03.356 --> 17:08.692
I saw you in the Officers'
Lounge, wearing that uniform.

17:08.778 --> 17:14.068
I knew you'd never pass a
genetic scan, so I overwrote
the security program.

17:14.159 --> 17:17.196
You did all that?
What, from here?

17:17.704 --> 17:20.241
Yes.

17:20.332 --> 17:25.452
Crichton, this is a
very good friend.

17:25.545 --> 17:27.627
Not acceptable, Commander.

17:27.714 --> 17:30.171
We must increase the efficiency
of the Aurora Chair.

17:30.258 --> 17:32.169
I'll need more techs, sir.
I'm understaffed.

17:32.260 --> 17:35.002
Understaffed or mismanaged?

17:35.096 --> 17:40.716
We've also got to find a match
for this tissue sample of
Aeryn's, or she'll die.

17:42.312 --> 17:43.677
Can you help us?

17:44.439 --> 17:46.145
Of course.

17:48.318 --> 17:50.309
Stay here. I'll take the sample
to the Medical Unit.

17:50.403 --> 17:52.655
No, no, no. I'm not going
to put you at risk.

17:52.739 --> 17:56.402
I won't be. I can fake the work
orders and the Med Techs won't
ask any questions.

17:56.493 --> 17:57.608
We're used to secrecy.

17:57.702 --> 18:00.819
It's still too dangerous.
I'll go.

18:01.539 --> 18:04.246
John, you should stay hidden.

18:11.383 --> 18:13.339
Well, she's right.

18:13.426 --> 18:16.088
One close call's enough.

18:16.179 --> 18:17.885
Yo, pip.

18:17.973 --> 18:19.929
I'm going to go back
to the lounge,

18:20.016 --> 18:25.386
and let our good friend, Mr.
Chief Security Officer buy
me another raslak.

18:26.356 --> 18:28.267
Come home alone.

18:54.301 --> 18:57.919
Oh! I came to see how
you were doing.

18:58.013 --> 19:01.676
You came to see if I was dead
so you could start going
through my possessions.

19:01.766 --> 19:04.849
Oh! I resent your unfounded
accusaﬂon.

19:04.936 --> 19:07.473
Furthermore, you have no
possessions worth taking.

19:07.564 --> 19:09.225
How inconsiderate.

19:09.316 --> 19:11.932
Yes. How terribly inconsiderate.

19:12.027 --> 19:13.983
Rygel, you are needed
on Command.

19:14.070 --> 19:15.651
I am? What for?

19:15.739 --> 19:18.481
A quick decision may be
required if the
Peacekeepers arrive.

19:18.575 --> 19:21.191
Hmm. A quick and correct
decision.

19:21.286 --> 19:24.778
I accept this vital
responsibility.

19:30.920 --> 19:32.376
Thank you.

19:33.381 --> 19:37.169
If a warrior cannot
die in battle,

19:37.260 --> 19:41.048
she can at least die alone.

19:41.139 --> 19:43.676
Talk about having something
to remember him by.

19:43.767 --> 19:46.053
(laughing)

19:46.144 --> 19:48.476
Duty cycle complete, Lieutenant?

19:48.563 --> 19:50.224
Oh, no, sir.

19:50.315 --> 19:52.146
Commander Javio.

19:52.233 --> 19:55.145
Iwas...

19:55.236 --> 19:57.397
leaving.

19:58.656 --> 20:01.693
Oh, I thought I'd get at least
another round out of him.

20:02.327 --> 20:03.692
Raslak.

20:05.789 --> 20:07.950
We can do much better than that.

20:09.376 --> 20:11.207
Zhaan.

20:12.379 --> 20:14.165
Aeryn is deteriorating fast.

20:14.255 --> 20:17.793
This is no way for someone
to die, even a Peacekeeper.

20:19.135 --> 20:22.252
D'Argo, all I can do is
ease herjourney.

20:22.347 --> 20:25.680
The nerve that was damaged
regulates toxin removal
functions.

20:25.767 --> 20:31.182
The poisons that are building
up in her body, they're
killing her.

20:31.272 --> 20:33.308
Well can you filter them out?

20:35.568 --> 20:38.025
I have no means to do that.

20:38.988 --> 20:40.398
Zhaan,

20:41.324 --> 20:44.066
Moya does, doesn't she?

20:52.085 --> 20:54.121
Not a bad way to live.

20:54.212 --> 20:56.498
Not at all.

20:58.425 --> 21:01.588
How would you like to stay?

21:01.678 --> 21:04.715
Whatever you're getting from
Larraq, I can easily double.

21:05.932 --> 21:08.093
I'm getting quite a bit.

21:08.726 --> 21:10.717
'Course, I'm worth it.

21:12.897 --> 21:15.354
I think you're selling
yourself short.

21:17.318 --> 21:22.438
Covert Op types are always
flying off to some backwater
planet and getting shot up.

21:23.366 --> 21:26.233
This is much more civilised.

21:28.413 --> 21:33.032
I am getting real tired of
running from system to system

21:33.126 --> 21:37.210
with a guy who's got a real
talent for getting himself
into danger.

21:37.297 --> 21:39.208
Exactly.

21:39.299 --> 21:43.508
With me, you'd be comfortable
and protected.

21:44.971 --> 21:48.429
Shall we continue this
discussion in my quarters?

21:50.268 --> 21:53.305
My policy's no free samples.

21:54.856 --> 21:57.188
Let me, uh...

21:57.275 --> 22:00.062
let me consider your
offer on my own.

22:08.745 --> 22:10.485
Good news.

22:10.580 --> 22:12.161
You find a match?

22:12.248 --> 22:13.328
Even better.

22:13.416 --> 22:15.828
We don't need to find a donor.

22:15.919 --> 22:21.039
Our medics can now synthesize
paraphoral tissue.

22:21.132 --> 22:24.420
Right. How long will it take
them to cook up a batch?

22:24.969 --> 22:27.176
They already have.

22:27.263 --> 22:31.927
One dose, some bed rest, and
she'll be as healthy as ever.

22:35.063 --> 22:38.271
Thanks doesn't even begin
to cover it.

22:43.446 --> 22:45.311
You don't have to thank me.

22:59.003 --> 23:00.959
I better get back to the ship.

23:01.047 --> 23:03.413
If I'm late, Aeryn dies.

23:03.508 --> 23:06.341
And I wouldn't even dream
of stopping you.

23:12.141 --> 23:14.723
We always seem to be
saying goodbye.

23:17.021 --> 23:18.431
Yeah.

23:19.857 --> 23:21.984
You'd think we'd get
better at it.

23:24.946 --> 23:26.436
Go.

24:09.324 --> 24:11.406
That man.

24:12.160 --> 24:14.151
He is an impostor.

24:14.245 --> 24:15.701
Seize him.

24:28.968 --> 24:30.208
Get him up!

24:38.478 --> 24:41.185
(electrical pulsing )

24:53.201 --> 24:58.241
My name is Larraq,
Peacekeeper Special Ops.

24:58.331 --> 25:01.664
Unfortunately, wrong,
on all counts.

25:03.336 --> 25:04.121
( pulsing increases)

25:04.212 --> 25:06.544
(grunting)

25:16.015 --> 25:18.347
lam Scorpius.

25:18.434 --> 25:22.473
But of course you are
Peacekeepen

25:22.563 --> 25:25.145
Funny, you don't look
like a Sebacean.

25:25.233 --> 25:28.145
On the other hand you
do look Sebacean.

25:28.236 --> 25:32.229
Yet your energy signature
is quite dissimilar.

25:33.032 --> 25:35.273
What species are you?

25:35.368 --> 25:37.825
And who are you working for?

25:38.663 --> 25:41.029
Get stuffed.

25:43.209 --> 25:45.666
( electrical crackling )

25:47.296 --> 25:49.708
You attempt to provoke me.

25:49.799 --> 25:52.541
Perhaps you were hoping I
will lose my composure

25:52.635 --> 25:57.504
and kill you before I've
extracted any information.

25:59.475 --> 26:02.683
I long ago learned the
advantages of patience.

26:06.274 --> 26:07.263
( electrical crackling )

26:09.277 --> 26:10.983
(groaning)

26:22.707 --> 26:24.072
(yells)

26:29.464 --> 26:31.580
What the hell was that?

26:32.592 --> 26:34.378
A memory.

26:34.469 --> 26:36.801
Random and indistinct
at the moment.

26:36.888 --> 26:40.722
It will take some time to map
your neural patterns.

26:40.808 --> 26:43.515
You stay the hell out
of mind, you fr...

26:43.603 --> 26:44.809
( screaming )

26:50.818 --> 26:54.561
That was a Leviathan ship,
was it not?

26:54.655 --> 27:00.366
I seem to remember a report
of an escaped Leviathan
prison transport.

27:00.453 --> 27:03.820
Have Javio check the
data files.

27:03.915 --> 27:07.248
You are a most interesting spy.

27:08.085 --> 27:11.168
( screaming )

27:13.633 --> 27:17.501
(rhythmic gurgling)

27:17.595 --> 27:21.634
This may help stabilize you
until Crichton returns
with the cure.

27:21.724 --> 27:24.056
Are you sure this won't
hurt Moya?

27:24.143 --> 27:26.179
Pilot says no.

27:26.270 --> 27:31.310
The amount of toxins your body
generates is insignificant to
Moya, relative to your sizes.

27:31.400 --> 27:32.526
What about her baby?

27:32.610 --> 27:35.272
D'Argo:
The baby's already well
over a sakmar.

27:36.197 --> 27:39.030
This will not affect it.

27:39.116 --> 27:45.578
Well, whether it works or not,
Zhaan, I commend you on
your ingenuity.

27:45.665 --> 27:48.372
Actually, it wasn't my idea.
It was...

27:51.170 --> 27:53.126
it was Pilot's.

27:58.052 --> 28:00.259
Crichton's been captured.

28:00.346 --> 28:02.507
Can you find out where they
are keeping him?

28:04.392 --> 28:06.883
I can't access main control.

28:06.978 --> 28:11.688
They must have shut down the
main grid because they suspect
someone is helping him.

28:11.774 --> 28:15.312
Sooner or later they're going
to find out who.

28:15.403 --> 28:19.021
(yells)

28:20.032 --> 28:23.741
(strained):
Waste... of... time.

28:23.828 --> 28:26.319
I'm not a spy.

28:26.414 --> 28:28.154
Javio:
According to the report,

28:28.249 --> 28:33.460
the Leviathan had a Delvian,
Hynerian and a Luxan aboard.

28:33.546 --> 28:36.208
No mention of a creature like
him or his female accomplice.

28:36.299 --> 28:38.881
Whom you have yet to locate.

28:41.137 --> 28:45.506
You charged my brother's
Prowler in that white
death pod of yours.

28:45.600 --> 28:47.932
You're talking about that near
miss I had the first minute
I got here?

28:48.019 --> 28:49.429
That was an accident.

28:49.520 --> 28:51.681
It was no "near-miss"
for my brother.

28:53.941 --> 28:56.353
That was Captain Bialar Crais.

28:56.444 --> 28:58.730
The Leviathan escaped
from his convoy.

28:58.821 --> 29:03.941
Scorpius:
As I recall, he received
special dispensation from the Council

29:04.035 --> 29:08.074
to head into the Uncharted
Territories and hunt it down.

29:08.164 --> 29:12.203
Right, but First Command lost
contact with his carrier
some time ago.

29:12.293 --> 29:14.750
I want to see more of that.

29:16.756 --> 29:22.422
I can't locate it again, sir,
but I've found something
linked to it.

29:23.304 --> 29:25.044
(yelling)

29:25.765 --> 29:27.551
Tauvo is dead.

29:27.642 --> 29:33.262
Struck down by a weak,
pathetic, inferior being.

29:33.356 --> 29:37.349
You will die in my hands.

29:37.443 --> 29:42.858
I suspect our Captain has
turned renegade.

29:42.949 --> 29:47.864
Broadcast a wide-dispersal
message, coded to Crais's
Command Carrier.

29:47.954 --> 29:52.072
Direct him to come immediately.

29:52.166 --> 29:54.202
You think he'll actually
show up?

29:54.293 --> 29:55.578
Certainly.

29:55.670 --> 29:58.161
Tell him we have his prey.

30:00.466 --> 30:02.422
What do you think?

30:02.510 --> 30:05.172
Will it work?

30:05.262 --> 30:08.629
I don't even think John
would recognize you.

30:08.724 --> 30:11.807
Let's track him down
and find out.

30:11.894 --> 30:13.430
( screaming )

30:27.284 --> 30:29.741
(grunting)

30:29.829 --> 30:34.368
Your memory holds an impressive
array of other races, Crichton.

30:34.458 --> 30:37.074
You're quite a well
traveled spy.

30:37.169 --> 30:41.583
For the ninth time, Nosferatu,
I am not a spy.

30:41.674 --> 30:44.416
His previous missions
are unimportant.

30:44.510 --> 30:48.674
I want to know who sent him
here, and why.

30:48.764 --> 30:50.425
Keep searching.

30:50.516 --> 30:52.973
It's deja vu all over again.

30:53.060 --> 30:54.391
(laughing)

30:55.104 --> 30:56.844
( screaming )

30:56.939 --> 30:59.681
Jack Crichton:
There are but a few planets
where we can live.

30:59.775 --> 31:03.359
The ancients have stories of a
world that will welcome us.

31:03.446 --> 31:05.152
We can only hope they're true.

31:05.239 --> 31:07.525
( beeping )

31:08.117 --> 31:09.857
Malfunction?

31:09.952 --> 31:12.534
Niem:
No, he's put up a neural block.

31:14.206 --> 31:16.288
It wasn't me.

31:16.375 --> 31:19.959
Damn, don't you hate it when
the batteries go dead!

31:20.046 --> 31:23.209
Scorpius:
Break through it.
Increase the extraction level.

31:26.260 --> 31:27.921
( screaming )

31:28.012 --> 31:31.004
Jack Crichton:
These equations are necessary
for creating a wormhole.

31:32.349 --> 31:34.089
I don't remember that.

31:34.185 --> 31:36.141
You're teaching me how to...

31:36.228 --> 31:39.220
No. You cannot access this
data consciously.

31:39.315 --> 31:41.727
You won't remember this part
of our encounter.

31:41.817 --> 31:44.775
We will not give you
wormhole technology.

31:44.862 --> 31:46.523
Crichton:
Why not?

31:46.614 --> 31:49.196
Jack:
If you're not smart enough to
discover it on your own,

31:49.283 --> 31:52.696
you're not smart enough to
handle it wisely.

31:52.787 --> 31:54.994
You'll have to find it yourself.

31:55.081 --> 32:00.826
The unconscious knowledge we've
given you will guide you,
nothing more.

32:00.920 --> 32:03.912
That's all that we can
do for you.

32:04.006 --> 32:05.667
But that should be enough.

32:05.758 --> 32:08.295
You are already on
the right path.

32:08.385 --> 32:11.422
Well, well, well.

32:11.514 --> 32:15.678
Our spy has an interest in
wormhole technology.

32:15.768 --> 32:20.182
He... he gave me the equations.

32:20.272 --> 32:23.105
And that's why you came
to this place.

32:23.192 --> 32:25.524
What's this base got
to do with...

32:27.363 --> 32:29.069
That's why you built it?

32:29.156 --> 32:33.149
( laughs )

32:33.244 --> 32:34.700
All this research.

32:34.787 --> 32:37.950
(laughing)

32:38.040 --> 32:41.783
You're trying to create
a wormhole!

32:41.877 --> 32:45.290
( laughs hysterically)

32:45.381 --> 32:47.372
As are you.

32:48.384 --> 32:50.170
That creature knows how.

32:50.261 --> 32:54.049
But he wouldn't tell you,
would he?

32:54.140 --> 32:56.472
Or so you thought.

32:56.559 --> 32:59.301
(gasping)

32:59.395 --> 33:00.475
So you sought that
knowledge here,

33:04.441 --> 33:11.313
never realising that you already
had it, locked deeply away.

33:12.867 --> 33:15.233
Find it.

33:15.327 --> 33:19.286
Segment his mind.
As many layers as it takes.

33:19.373 --> 33:21.329
No... no.

33:21.417 --> 33:22.202
Please...

33:22.293 --> 33:24.079
( screaming )

33:32.219 --> 33:34.756
Or his mind will simply quuefy.

33:34.847 --> 33:38.260
He seems to be an exceptionally
strong species.

33:41.770 --> 33:44.056
A short recuperation

33:45.024 --> 33:47.265
and then we'll start again.

34:02.291 --> 34:03.280
Hey!

34:03.375 --> 34:05.240
Hey! You don't put that
thing in here!

34:05.336 --> 34:06.576
I don't want a roommate!

34:06.670 --> 34:08.285
Get it out!

34:09.340 --> 34:11.171
Hey, that's my mat!

34:11.258 --> 34:12.919
Now get off my mat!

34:13.010 --> 34:14.341
Go on!

34:14.929 --> 34:16.385
Go!

34:18.349 --> 34:20.806
Fine. I don't want any trouble.

34:20.893 --> 34:22.508
This is my side.

34:22.603 --> 34:23.763
That's your side!

34:23.854 --> 34:25.594
This is my side!
You stay on your side!

34:25.689 --> 34:27.020
My side! Your side!

34:27.107 --> 34:28.017
My side! Your side!

34:28.108 --> 34:30.315
My side! Your side!

34:37.660 --> 34:41.118
You were just in my chair,
too, weren't you?

34:42.873 --> 34:45.330
You talking about
Scorpius's chair.

34:45.417 --> 34:47.157
Ah, Scorpy.

34:47.253 --> 34:55.467
Scorpy puts me in the chair
over and over and over and
over and over...

34:56.303 --> 34:58.134
The chair did this to you?

34:58.222 --> 35:01.305
(babbling)

35:18.659 --> 35:21.150
Danger...

35:21.245 --> 35:23.611
Danger, Will Robinson.

35:24.915 --> 35:27.156
Beware of the chair.

35:28.794 --> 35:30.830
Beware of the chair.

35:34.466 --> 35:36.297
The treatment's working.

35:36.385 --> 35:40.424
But all it seems to be doing
is stopping her from
deteriorating further.

35:41.765 --> 35:44.723
Why didn't you want me to tell
her it was your idea?

35:44.810 --> 35:48.177
Earlier on, Aeryn told me she
wanted to die alone.

35:49.773 --> 35:54.142
As a warrior, I should respect
her wishes and not interfere.

35:54.236 --> 35:55.567
You did a good thing.

35:55.654 --> 35:57.485
You may have saved her life.

35:57.573 --> 36:01.486
Despite her words, she really
didn't want to die.

36:01.577 --> 36:04.819
I don't even believe that she
wants to die alone.

36:08.250 --> 36:09.956
Pilot!

36:10.044 --> 36:12.285
Pilot, are we under attack?

36:12.379 --> 36:14.335
No. It's Moya.

36:14.423 --> 36:17.130
She's having muscular
contractions.

36:17.926 --> 36:19.211
Is she giving birth?

36:19.303 --> 36:20.884
I'm not sure.

36:22.389 --> 36:24.766
It's killing Aeryn.
We've got to stop the
treatment now.

36:24.850 --> 36:26.431
Hold her down.

36:27.227 --> 36:28.216
Right, Pilot!

36:28.312 --> 36:30.428
Isolate Aeryn now!

36:45.788 --> 36:48.404
Let's hope Crichton gets
here soon.

37:20.614 --> 37:27.326
This should bypass the grid
and hook us directly with
main control.

37:27.413 --> 37:29.904
Spare me the technobabble,
Gadget Girl.

37:29.998 --> 37:31.863
Let's just get on with it.

37:41.969 --> 37:43.755
Again, Scorpy!

37:43.846 --> 37:46.758
Thrill me again!

37:46.849 --> 37:49.682
Excuse me, sir.
Captain Crais has arrived.

37:56.859 --> 37:58.724
Where is he?

37:58.819 --> 38:01.105
Where's Crichton?

38:07.369 --> 38:09.826
Scorpius:
This way, Captain.

38:12.249 --> 38:15.867
Crais:
l have orders to recapture the
Leviathan and its passengers.

38:15.961 --> 38:19.203
Captain, Crichton has
vital information.

38:19.298 --> 38:21.254
Until I get it, you may
not have him.

38:21.341 --> 38:24.003
I order you to release
him to me.

38:24.094 --> 38:27.757
Your adherence to orders
is selective.

38:27.848 --> 38:32.342
You have repeatedly failed to
cease the pursuit and return
to First Command.

38:32.436 --> 38:34.142
(chuckling)

38:34.229 --> 38:37.687
I have received no such orders.

38:37.774 --> 38:41.938
Your dereliction of duty is
not my prime concern.

38:42.029 --> 38:47.149
Give me your full cooperation,
and you can have Crichton,

38:47.242 --> 38:49.198
when I have finished with him.

38:49.286 --> 38:53.120
Give me Crichton now, and I'll
get you all the information
he possesses.

38:53.207 --> 38:56.244
Torture alone would be
ineffective.

38:56.335 --> 39:00.169
Only the Aurora Chair can
extract the information
we need.

39:00.255 --> 39:04.248
But the chair might well kill
him before you find it.

39:04.343 --> 39:07.460
Therein lies the stalemate
I must break.

39:09.014 --> 39:13.474
You know this human better
than anyone.

39:13.560 --> 39:17.724
What would persuade him to
stop resisting the chair?

39:20.859 --> 39:23.771
(beeping and clicking)

39:23.862 --> 39:25.568
Ifound him.

39:27.241 --> 39:29.607
He's in a cell on level nine.

39:29.701 --> 39:33.319
Hey, I may be able to
patch into it.

39:34.289 --> 39:36.154
Let's see.

39:39.294 --> 39:40.249
( static over speaker)

39:40.337 --> 39:41.918
Gilina:
John...

39:42.297 --> 39:43.707
John.

39:45.634 --> 39:49.343
It's Gilina.

39:49.429 --> 39:52.296
Keep your back to the wall
camera and it's safe to talk.

39:52.391 --> 39:55.007
I've bypassed the audio in
the monitoring station.

39:55.102 --> 39:56.638
How you doing? You okay?

39:56.728 --> 39:58.229
Are they onto you?

39:58.313 --> 39:59.598
No.

39:59.690 --> 40:01.931
Chiana and I are in hiding.

40:02.025 --> 40:03.401
Chiana, are you there?

40:03.485 --> 40:07.194
Listen, I stashed the tissue
gizmo under the checkpoint.

40:07.281 --> 40:09.738
Third intersection past the T.
You got that?

40:09.825 --> 40:11.065
Got it.

40:11.159 --> 40:13.320
Good. Go find it and get it
back to the ship.

40:14.329 --> 40:16.069
We've got to get you
out of there.

40:16.164 --> 40:17.244
No, no. Forget about me.

40:17.332 --> 40:19.994
Just get the sample
back to Moya.

40:20.085 --> 40:21.586
Aeryn can't have that much time.

40:21.670 --> 40:22.705
John...

40:22.796 --> 40:23.501
(door opening)

40:23.589 --> 40:25.170
There's somebody coming.

40:30.304 --> 40:34.343
(laughing)

40:34.433 --> 40:36.014
Crais.

40:36.727 --> 40:38.558
How do I get out of this place?

40:38.645 --> 40:42.479
Once I take off, they'll blast
me out of the sky before
I'm half a metra.

40:43.442 --> 40:45.728
I don't understand it.

40:45.819 --> 40:49.232
Why wouldn't Crichton try
and save himself?

40:50.449 --> 40:54.488
Chiana, does Aeryn mean
that much to him?

40:56.371 --> 40:57.622
No.

41:00.375 --> 41:02.707
Aeryn's just a...

41:02.794 --> 41:04.534
just a shipmate.

41:06.506 --> 41:08.713
Crichton is in love with you.

41:10.636 --> 41:13.252
Why do you think he's staying?

41:13.347 --> 41:18.182
Look, once Aeryn's okay we'll
come back with the
reinforcements.

41:18.268 --> 41:20.350
Get the both of you.

41:20.437 --> 41:22.268
Yeah?

41:24.441 --> 41:26.272
Okay.

41:27.069 --> 41:29.230
If he wants me to go with him.

41:30.364 --> 41:32.229
Let's get you out of here.

41:34.159 --> 41:35.899
You are dead, Crichton.

41:36.870 --> 41:39.282
But you have one choice.

41:39.373 --> 41:43.116
Do you wish to save the lives
of your shipmates on Moya?

41:43.710 --> 41:45.325
( scoffs )

41:45.420 --> 41:47.206
What are you talking about?

41:47.297 --> 41:49.413
Why do you think I'm here?

41:49.508 --> 41:51.669
I've recaptured the Leviathan.

41:51.760 --> 41:54.297
The fugitives are back
in my custody.

41:54.388 --> 41:55.673
However,

41:55.764 --> 41:59.803
whether I deliver them alive
or dead is up to me.

42:01.895 --> 42:03.760
How do I keep them alive?

42:03.855 --> 42:06.847
Scorpius:
Stop resisting the Aurora Chair.

42:06.942 --> 42:13.609
Allow us to probe freely, for
any information we wish.

42:17.369 --> 42:20.236
That's not a very good option.

42:20.330 --> 42:23.163
You are not in a very
good position.

42:24.668 --> 42:28.627
So, everybody on the
ship's okay?

42:29.297 --> 42:31.083
Zhaan?

42:32.592 --> 42:34.548
Aeryn?

42:34.636 --> 42:38.174
They're all unharmed,
as is the Leviathan.

42:40.767 --> 42:42.974
They're all in perfect health.

42:44.229 --> 42:46.891
That could easily change.

42:49.234 --> 42:51.520
Fetch the comfy chair.

42:52.320 --> 42:53.730
( beeping )

42:53.822 --> 42:56.780
There. I've programmed a blind
spot into the targeting system.

42:56.867 --> 43:00.280
Keep your Prowler on this
trajectory and they won't
even see it.

43:01.246 --> 43:03.111
How will I know if it works?

43:03.206 --> 43:05.663
You won't get blasted
out of the sky.

43:06.668 --> 43:08.204
Great.

43:08.295 --> 43:10.627
Now all I have to do is
get to the Prowler.

43:10.714 --> 43:11.999
Well I'll give you a diversion.

43:12.090 --> 43:13.205
How much head start do you
think you'll need?

43:13.300 --> 43:16.007
Give me 400 microts.

43:16.678 --> 43:17.918
Go.

43:19.181 --> 43:20.591
One more, sir.

43:20.682 --> 43:23.389
Please! Please, one more!

43:24.311 --> 43:26.927
I got my mind right, boss.

43:28.106 --> 43:29.312
Be nice.

43:29.399 --> 43:31.185
We will.

43:33.361 --> 43:35.226
(groaning)

43:46.625 --> 43:48.161
Where are you going, Tech?

43:48.251 --> 43:50.082
Sorry, sir?

43:50.712 --> 43:52.248
Where are you going?

43:52.339 --> 43:54.125
I... I'm, uh...

43:54.216 --> 43:55.456
level three, sir.

43:55.550 --> 43:58.337
The Commander's quarters.

43:58.428 --> 44:00.089
Please forgive me.

44:00.180 --> 44:01.636
Peacekeeper
On your way.

44:16.321 --> 44:17.276
Niem:
Repoﬂ.

44:17.364 --> 44:18.945
Level six clear.

44:21.076 --> 44:22.612
Five...

44:23.829 --> 44:25.365
four...

44:25.455 --> 44:27.195
three...

44:28.416 --> 44:30.407
two...

44:31.628 --> 44:33.243
one.

44:33.338 --> 44:36.296
Computer Voice:
Evacuation warning.
Reactor overload.

44:36.383 --> 44:38.749
Evacuation warning.

44:38.844 --> 44:42.302
Evacuation warning.
Reactor overload.

44:43.056 --> 44:44.136
Evacuation warning.

44:44.224 --> 44:45.930
Reactor overload.

45:00.365 --> 45:01.696
Javio:
Clear the area!

45:01.783 --> 45:04.240
Get everyone away from
the reactor core!

45:04.327 --> 45:06.704
Emergency radiation gear
is on level ten!

45:06.788 --> 45:08.449
Commander Javio, wait!

45:08.540 --> 45:11.122
Sir, this Prowler is
non-operational.

45:11.209 --> 45:13.200
There's a faulty component
in the, uh...

45:13.295 --> 45:18.005
in the froonium drive, causing
instabilities in the...
the stabilizer.

45:18.091 --> 45:21.709
Uh... it may have been fixed.
If I could just have a look.

45:37.277 --> 45:39.734
Very good, Chiana.

45:39.821 --> 45:42.984
But I thought the Commander was
meant to be the last one
to evacuate.

45:43.074 --> 45:45.565
It's funny. I believe
just the opposite.

45:45.660 --> 45:47.196
We could both leave.

45:47.287 --> 45:49.824
Continue our earlier
discussion.

45:49.915 --> 45:52.247
It won't work twice.

46:02.302 --> 46:03.758
( screaming )

46:32.332 --> 46:35.244
(groaning)

46:41.675 --> 46:43.336
(sighs)

46:48.181 --> 46:50.422
( hypodermic hisses)

46:54.938 --> 46:56.303
What was that?

46:57.440 --> 46:58.600
A tissue sample.

46:58.692 --> 47:00.808
Crichton succeeded.

47:02.862 --> 47:04.602
I'm not going to die.

47:04.698 --> 47:06.859
D'Argo:
As you once said to me,

47:06.950 --> 47:11.489
"you will die, but not today."

47:11.579 --> 47:15.288
Are you sure about that?
I'm starting to hallucinate.

47:17.752 --> 47:21.165
You make a worse Peacekeeper
than Crichton.

47:21.256 --> 47:22.541
Oh...

47:22.632 --> 47:25.169
Glad to see you're okay.

47:27.220 --> 47:29.085
Where is he? I want to see him.

47:30.432 --> 47:33.765
You will. Soon.

47:39.441 --> 47:41.056
Great idea.

47:41.151 --> 47:43.608
Some of us desperately
need to bathe.

47:46.614 --> 47:47.899
D'argo?

47:47.991 --> 47:50.949
I'll stay here and watch
over her, just in case.

48:07.302 --> 48:09.418
Thank you.

48:15.393 --> 48:19.136
Niem:
The reactor warning
was a false alarm.

48:19.230 --> 48:22.597
Sir, a Prowler has launched
without authorization.

48:22.692 --> 48:23.807
It has vanished.

48:23.902 --> 48:26.484
There are no sensor
readings at all.

48:29.115 --> 48:30.980
Crichton's accomplice.

48:31.576 --> 48:34.568
One of them, anyway.

48:34.662 --> 48:37.324
The false alarm was a diversion.

48:38.208 --> 48:39.493
Who triggered it?

48:39.584 --> 48:42.246
We don't know, sir.
We're still checking.

48:42.337 --> 48:44.248
(laughing)

48:47.383 --> 48:49.169
(groaning)

48:52.055 --> 48:54.137
Crichton will tell us.

48:54.224 --> 48:57.512
(screams echoing )
