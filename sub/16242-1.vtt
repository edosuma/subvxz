00:38.080 --> 00:41.960
Someone is here.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.480
Not closely.

00:45.560 --> 00:49.320
Not willingly.

00:49.360 --> 00:52.880
I feel a holding back.

00:52.960 --> 00:55.800
What's the trouble, Henry?

00:57.200 --> 01:02.040
Too many memories,
too much pain.

01:02.120 --> 01:05.960
Too... much... sorrow.

01:09.920 --> 01:12.720
Whoever is there with you,

01:12.760 --> 01:16.320
<i>tell them
to speak up, Henry.</i>

01:16.400 --> 01:19.360
<i>Tell them to come closer.</i>

01:19.440 --> 01:23.040
<i>I think I know
who it is, Madame Blanche.</i>

01:23.120 --> 01:25.960
I think I know
what's bothering her.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.640
<i>Her, is it?
Never you mind, Miss Rainbird.</i>

01:29.680 --> 01:31.880
I won't have you doing
Henry's work for him.

01:33.920 --> 01:37.720
<i>Now, let's have it,
my love. That's why
we're here tonight.</i>

01:37.800 --> 01:40.560
<i>To help my friend
be rid of her torment.</i>

01:40.600 --> 01:45.280
She has a right
to rest her weary head
on a pillow each night...

01:45.360 --> 01:49.120
and sleep the peaceful
sleep of the angels.

01:49.200 --> 01:52.200
H- How did you know
about my troubled sleep?

01:52.280 --> 01:57.520
Who told you?
Her nights cannot go on
like this much longer.

01:57.600 --> 02:00.640
I- I never told a soul
about my nightmares.

02:00.720 --> 02:03.880
How could you...
Who is this person
who arrives...

02:03.920 --> 02:07.640
in our presence tonight,
but does not dare
to come close to us?

02:07.720 --> 02:12.360
It's her.
It's my sister Harriet.

02:12.400 --> 02:16.600
- It must be.
She stays her distance,

02:16.680 --> 02:19.240
Julia Rainbird,
for she does not feel...

02:19.280 --> 02:21.360
your love or
your kindness yet.

02:21.440 --> 02:25.480
There is selfishness
where you are.

02:25.560 --> 02:28.360
I've had all
I can take from her.

02:28.400 --> 02:31.600
Night after night,
coming into my dreams.

02:31.680 --> 02:35.720
<i>Whining, complaining,
trying to make me feel guilty,</i>

02:35.760 --> 02:38.760
<i>as though I need her
to tell me right from wrong.</i>

02:38.840 --> 02:42.680
Tell her I know
what has to be done.

02:42.760 --> 02:46.080
I've been wanting
to do it for a year.

02:46.160 --> 02:50.320
But it is I, Julia Rainbird,
who has made the decision.

02:51.520 --> 02:54.600
I don't need her
to goad me on!

02:54.640 --> 02:59.440
<i>They're making me ill
with their ugly words
in my ugly dreams.</i>

02:59.520 --> 03:03.080
Tell her to stop it,
to go away and
leave me alone.

03:03.120 --> 03:06.920
Oh, no. No, no.
Don't let her go!

03:07.000 --> 03:10.360
- Don't let her go away.
- Harriet?

03:10.440 --> 03:12.440
Harriet, stay
with us, Harriet.

03:12.520 --> 03:17.000
<i>Your sister wants
to speak to you now,
from the depths of her soul.</i>

03:19.640 --> 03:21.880
What's wrong? What is it?

03:21.960 --> 03:25.800
<i>She says,
"I've waited so long...</i>

03:25.880 --> 03:27.880
"to hear from you, Julia.

03:27.920 --> 03:30.920
I've been so unhappy
without you."

03:32.960 --> 03:35.720
It is you, Harriet.

03:35.760 --> 03:38.800
Oh, I'm so sorry!

03:38.880 --> 03:41.680
I- I should never
have made you do it.

03:41.760 --> 03:44.560
<i>Oh, it's all past now.</i>

03:44.640 --> 03:47.880
<i>But I'll do what I can
to make up for it.</i>

03:47.920 --> 03:52.040
If he's still alive,
I'll find your son.

03:52.080 --> 03:55.880
<i>And I'll take him
in my arms and love him...</i>

03:55.960 --> 03:58.800
<i>as if I were you,
my poor Harriet.</i>

03:58.840 --> 04:02.360
And I'll...
I'll make him one of us.

04:02.440 --> 04:06.520
And give him everything.
Everything!

04:06.600 --> 04:09.480
Far away.

04:09.520 --> 04:11.680
So far, far away.

04:11.760 --> 04:15.440
Bu-But I need her.
I need her help.

04:15.480 --> 04:17.959
I can't do it alone.

04:18.040 --> 04:19.920
You see,
I need her memory.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.360
<i>It's over 40 years ago,
and I don't know where
the child was taken...</i>

04:24.440 --> 04:26.320
<i>or who it was given to.</i>

04:26.360 --> 04:30.680
I don't know where
he is now or who he is.

04:30.760 --> 04:32.840
<i>The true measure of
Julia Rainbird's love...</i>

04:32.920 --> 04:34.800
lies in what she does now,

04:34.840 --> 04:38.240
with your help,
of course, and mine,

04:38.320 --> 04:41.240
and that of
the dear, departed one...

04:41.320 --> 04:44.600
who has
drifted so far from us.

04:44.680 --> 04:47.480
We understand him.
Don't we, Miss Rainbird?

04:47.560 --> 04:52.520
Oh, yes. Yes, I do.
I'm willing to do
anything. Anything at all.

04:52.560 --> 04:55.440
In the end, there
will be happiness.

04:55.480 --> 05:00.760
<i>From the tears of the past,
the desert of the heart
will bloom.</i>

05:00.840 --> 05:05.560
<i>Good-bye, Julia Rainbird!
Good-bye, Blanche.</i>

05:09.680 --> 05:11.840
Good-bye.

05:13.040 --> 05:16.720
Madame Blanche!
Are you all right?

05:16.800 --> 05:22.000
Oh. It was...

05:22.040 --> 05:23.920
What in the world’s
been going on here?

05:23.960 --> 05:26.120
I feel as though I've
been properly done over.

05:26.200 --> 05:30.320
Don't you remember
what happened?
Mm-mm.

05:30.400 --> 05:33.440
Not the details,
Miss Rainbird, only the gist,
if you know what I mean.

05:33.520 --> 05:35.800
Suppose you give me
the gist of it.

05:35.880 --> 05:39.040
Oh well, I wonder...

05:39.120 --> 05:41.280
Could I trouble you
for a sip of something?
Ju-Just...

05:41.360 --> 05:43.200
Oh, of course.
What would you like?

05:43.280 --> 05:46.320
Oh, a double shot
of anyth...

05:46.400 --> 05:49.920
A spot of that sherry
might be nice.
Oh, yes. Of course.

05:54.400 --> 05:57.240
Thank you.

06:01.480 --> 06:06.080
- Now, tell me what
you remember of the seance.
- In a nutshell?

06:06.160 --> 06:08.040
<i>Please.</i>

06:08.080 --> 06:11.200
Well...

06:11.280 --> 06:14.200
About 40 years ago,
you arranged to have...

06:14.280 --> 06:17.640
your sister Harriet's
baby given away
without a trace.

06:17.720 --> 06:20.680
<i>And now your bad dreams
and troubled conscience
tell you...</i>

06:20.760 --> 06:23.280
<i>to find the grown-up
person, take him
into the family...</i>

06:23.360 --> 06:25.200
<i>and bestow
your wealth on him.</i>

06:25.280 --> 06:27.760
<i>Excellent.
Thank you.</i>

06:27.840 --> 06:31.280
And why did
I force my sister
to give the child away?

06:31.360 --> 06:35.840
I guess the kid
was a... illegitimate,
Miss Rainbird.

06:37.200 --> 06:40.040
I don't want you
to think me a puritan,
Madame Blanche.

06:40.080 --> 06:43.680
But 40 years ago,
an unmarried mother...

06:43.760 --> 06:46.160
was not the commonplace
it is nowadays.

06:46.240 --> 06:48.120
And in a family like ours,

06:48.200 --> 06:50.960
a scandal had to be
covered up at all costs.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.160
I understand.

06:53.200 --> 06:55.160
And I'm still
sufficiently old-fashioned,

06:55.240 --> 06:58.040
<i>and sufficiently protective
of the Rainbird name,</i>

06:58.120 --> 06:59.960
<i>to want to seek
the missing heir...</i>

07:00.040 --> 07:03.000
in a private
and secret fashion,

07:03.080 --> 07:05.920
rather than go
to detective agencies...

07:06.000 --> 07:07.960
and put notices
in the newspapers.

07:08.040 --> 07:11.560
A most wise decision,
Miss Rainbird.

07:12.720 --> 07:14.960
Well, now, suppose
we get to the reason...

07:15.040 --> 07:16.880
for my sending for you.

07:16.960 --> 07:19.440
I'm 78 years of age.

07:19.520 --> 07:22.760
I would like
to go to my grave
with a quiet conscience.

07:22.800 --> 07:27.080
Particularly as I know
that my only heir
is out there somewhere,

07:27.160 --> 07:30.960
deprived by my acts
of his true Rainbird name.

07:31.040 --> 07:34.240
Will you help me
with your powers?

07:37.040 --> 07:39.240
If in your heart
you believe that I can,

07:39.320 --> 07:42.080
then I owe it
to both of us
to try, Miss Rainbird.

07:42.160 --> 07:44.040
No, I'm too old
for trying.

07:44.120 --> 07:47.000
I've only time enough
left for results!

07:47.080 --> 07:52.360
Find him for me, Madame Blanche.
Use your spirit-control,
your "Henry."

07:52.440 --> 07:54.520
Get through to my sister.

07:54.600 --> 07:58.480
Find her son,
whoever he is,
wherever he is,

07:58.560 --> 08:01.840
and I'll pay you $10,000.

08:01.920 --> 08:05.280
Te...

08:07.720 --> 08:11.120
Only if you genuinely
wish to, Miss Rainbird.

08:11.200 --> 08:15.040
But let's
not think of this
as a payment to me.

08:15.120 --> 08:17.360
There are many causes
dear to my heart,

08:17.440 --> 08:20.720
which need
all the charity
the world can spare.

08:20.760 --> 08:23.880
You've no idea
how refreshing it is
for a woman of my wealth...

08:23.920 --> 08:26.600
to find someone
who has so little use
for money.

08:26.680 --> 08:28.640
Thank you.

08:28.720 --> 08:32.240
Well, now, I regard
our arrangement as completed.

08:32.320 --> 08:36.080
I... It's my bedtime.

08:36.120 --> 08:38.600
I must take leave
of your delightful company.

08:38.679 --> 08:41.520
This has been
a most memorable evening
for me, Miss Rainbird.

08:41.600 --> 08:44.400
See to it that you
make it a rewarding one.

08:44.440 --> 08:46.920
At the risk
of repeating myself,

08:47.000 --> 08:48.880
I hope
you will not forget...

08:48.920 --> 08:51.200
that nobody,
absolutely no one,

08:51.280 --> 08:53.160
should know
of our search.

08:53.240 --> 08:56.320
The Rainbird name
must be protected.

08:56.400 --> 08:58.560
My jaw is locked.

08:58.640 --> 09:02.600
On that note, I will
say good-bye, and
thank you for coming.

09:35.760 --> 09:37.800
So, how'd it go?

09:39.200 --> 09:42.320
I don't know.
Having to do Henry
is murder on my throat.

09:42.400 --> 09:46.160
<i>Murder.
Yeah, yeah.
I know.</i>

09:46.240 --> 09:49.360
<i>- So how did it go?
- She's hooked,
waiting to be pulled in.</i>

09:49.440 --> 09:52.080
Another one
of your $25 sardines?

09:52.160 --> 09:56.040
No. This is a big one,
George. A great big whale.

09:56.120 --> 09:58.200
Well, come on. Give.

09:58.280 --> 10:00.200
Keep your eyes on the road.
Don't rush me.

10:00.280 --> 10:02.680
Okay, Blanchie.

10:02.760 --> 10:05.000
<i>Start way up
at the top.</i>

10:05.080 --> 10:08.880
Well, it was as simple
as A-B-C. Henry came to me
from the Upper Brightness,

10:08.960 --> 10:11.320
whispered to me,
"This woman's been having
sleep problems."

10:11.400 --> 10:14.840
From there on, things
followed naturally, logically.

10:14.920 --> 10:18.000
Aha! So I came
through for you again,
didn't I, darlin’?

10:18.080 --> 10:20.200
No. What are you
talking about, George?

10:20.240 --> 10:22.280
What do you mean,
what am I talking about?

10:22.360 --> 10:25.080
You know damn well
what I'm talkin’ about.

10:25.160 --> 10:27.720
All that information
that I dug up by gabbin’
to the local druggist...

10:27.800 --> 10:29.680
about how she was
drivin’ him crazy...

10:29.720 --> 10:31.600
tryin’ to get sleeping pills
without a prescription!

10:31.640 --> 10:34.960
That could have been
very, very useful to me.

10:35.040 --> 10:36.880
Why didn't you
tell me about that?

10:36.960 --> 10:40.520
What do you mean, why didn't
I tell you? I told you.
You know damn well I told you.

10:40.560 --> 10:44.120
<i>No, you always think
you tell me things,
and you forget to.</i>

10:44.200 --> 10:48.160
I have to go
through heaven and hell,
the Great Beyond, with Henry.

10:48.240 --> 10:51.360
<i>Henry, my ass.
It was me.</i>

10:51.440 --> 10:53.520
It's always me.

10:53.600 --> 10:56.680
Without my research,
you're about as psychic
as a dry salami.

10:56.760 --> 10:59.120
Nasty. Nasty, nasty.

10:59.200 --> 11:02.840
I'm sick and tired
of having you hang me
by the crystal balls.

11:02.920 --> 11:05.680
Leave your crystal balls
out of this, George.

11:05.760 --> 11:09.160
No, let's leave Henry
out of this and keep
the bullshit for your customers.

11:09.200 --> 11:11.120
You're jealous of him,
aren't you?

11:11.200 --> 11:14.040
Oh, please, Blanche.

11:14.120 --> 11:16.400
<i>I like your jealousy.
It's your driving that stinks.</i>

11:16.480 --> 11:19.480
Hey, look.
I happen to be an actor,
not a cab driver.

11:19.560 --> 11:22.600
I can play cab drivers,
but I sure as hell don't
have to drive like one.

11:22.680 --> 11:24.840
Well, until I can collect
from Julia Rainbird,

11:24.920 --> 11:27.440
I'm afraid you're
gonna have to go on
playing a cab driver.

11:27.520 --> 11:30.440
<i>Neither of us
seems to be very fond
of starving to death.</i>

11:30.480 --> 11:33.960
Well, how are we supposed
to collect? How much is this
Rainbird whale gonna spout up?

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
Also, you're gonna have
to go on playing a private eye.

11:37.040 --> 11:39.400
Christ, no! I've had it
playing private eyes.

11:39.440 --> 11:42.760
Christ, yes!
Now, George.

11:42.840 --> 11:44.920
Stop blaspheming.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.920
You wanna put the curse
on ten big ones?

11:48.640 --> 11:50.800
Now, wait a minute,
Blanche.

11:50.880 --> 11:53.520
- Did you say ten big ones?
- Mm-hmm.

11:53.600 --> 11:55.440
<i>Ten thousand?
Mm-hmm.</i>

11:55.520 --> 11:58.440
- Dollars?
- Dollars, George!

11:59.920 --> 12:02.320
Now, Blanche,
you got any idea...

12:02.360 --> 12:05.200
what you and I could do
with ten grand?

12:05.240 --> 12:07.240
Mm-hmm. We could
even get married.

12:07.280 --> 12:10.040
What are you always
a wet blanket for?

12:10.120 --> 12:12.520
Oh, you flatter me so.

12:12.600 --> 12:14.480
Well, what's the deal?
What do we have to do?

12:14.520 --> 12:16.720
I'll tell you about it
in bed, afterwards.

12:16.800 --> 12:19.240
Aw, come on, Blanche.
Give me a hint.

12:19.280 --> 12:21.960
Just a little...
Foreplay.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.840
All right.
Find one man. That's all.

12:24.880 --> 12:27.800
Well, we've had
to do worse than that.
What's his name?

12:27.880 --> 12:32.080
Hmm.
Ah... nobody knows.

12:32.160 --> 12:35.400
<i>Well, who is he?
That's a problem.
Nobody knows.</i>

12:35.440 --> 12:39.000
Where is he?
- Nobody knows.

12:39.080 --> 12:41.680
Well, for chrissake!
You mean, nobody knows,
Blanche?

12:41.760 --> 12:44.040
Nobody knows his name,
or where he is,
or who he is?

12:44.080 --> 12:46.080
Well, George, stop yelling.

12:46.160 --> 12:49.760
There's a possibility
of one person
who might have known.

12:49.840 --> 12:52.920
<i>Well, who's that?
Julia Rainbird didn't
mention him to me.</i>

12:53.000 --> 12:55.400
Fortunately, her friend
Ida Cookson did.

12:55.480 --> 12:58.120
<i>Well, who is it?
The Rainbird family chauffeur.</i>

12:58.200 --> 13:01.320
Well, now you're talkin’.
Now we're on our way.

13:01.400 --> 13:05.120
Trouble is... Well,

13:05.200 --> 13:07.120
he's been dead
for 25 years.

13:07.200 --> 13:09.320
Oh, for chrissake, Blanche...

13:09.400 --> 13:11.760
Oh, no, no, no, no, no,
don't start to fret, George,

13:11.840 --> 13:14.040
or our water bed will be
no fun at all tonight.

13:14.120 --> 13:17.160
As an actor,
you should know fretting
will ruin a performance.

13:17.200 --> 13:19.720
You're not gonna
have to worry about
my performance tonight.

13:19.760 --> 13:22.800
<i>As a matter of fact,
uh, on this very evening,</i>

13:22.880 --> 13:26.400
you're gonna see
a standing ovation.

14:09.840 --> 14:13.200
She's here.
No, not a man.
It's a woman.

14:13.280 --> 14:16.200
Right.
Follow me.

14:35.800 --> 14:38.520
As long as you've got
Victor Constantine,
we can't touch you.

14:38.600 --> 14:41.640
So you might as well
put that thing away.

14:58.880 --> 15:02.000
<i> You've been
calling yourself "The Trader,"
so we thought you were a man.</i>

15:09.920 --> 15:12.720
<i> I think
we deserve some assurance
that the victim is still alive.</i>

15:18.000 --> 15:22.200
<i> All radios have been
removed from the helicopter,
as you instructed.</i>

15:29.280 --> 15:33.800
"Mr. Constantine will be
unconscious but in perfect
condition when picked up.

15:33.880 --> 15:36.320
Just let him
sleep the drug off."

15:38.480 --> 15:40.360
All right, Sergeant,
turn on the lights.

16:08.400 --> 16:10.600
Don't try
and be a hero.
Yes, sir.

16:14.160 --> 16:16.040
Well, we've
done our part.

16:19.440 --> 16:21.680
Where are we goin’?

16:44.320 --> 16:46.600
Not one goddamn mistake.

16:54.040 --> 16:56.720
How far
are we going?

16:58.160 --> 17:00.360
<i>It's lucky for you
they've still got
the victim.</i>

17:00.440 --> 17:03.960
I'd like nothing better
than to toss you right out
of this thing on your head.

17:09.119 --> 17:11.480
You sure have
this little trip
mapped out, don't you?

17:16.160 --> 17:18.480
I bet that thing
isn't even loaded.

17:33.040 --> 17:35.160
Golf course, huh?

18:46.240 --> 18:49.240
Brilliant.
Absolutely perfect.

19:08.880 --> 19:13.240
My feet are killing me.
These damn six-inch heels.

19:13.320 --> 19:15.680
I happen to like
tall women.

19:15.760 --> 19:18.400
Everybody likes
tall women.

19:18.480 --> 19:21.200
In fact, everyone's
going to be looking
for a tall woman.

19:21.280 --> 19:23.120
<i>Aside from
complaining a lot,</i>

19:23.200 --> 19:25.160
<i>what have you been
doing with yourself
lately?</i>

19:25.240 --> 19:28.200
Oh, nothing much.
Picking up a ransom,
that sort of thing.

19:28.240 --> 19:30.800
Did you see anyone,
uh, we know?

19:30.880 --> 19:35.280
Two men who look
like police and a third
who just had to be F.B.I.

19:35.360 --> 19:37.840
You mix with
the nicest people.

19:37.920 --> 19:40.840
Beats housework.

19:40.920 --> 19:44.600
<i>Did you say
anything to them?
Not a syllable.</i>

19:44.680 --> 19:46.760
Now, you see, honey?

19:46.800 --> 19:49.560
I told you you could learn
to keep your mouth shut,
if you tried.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.880
Look who's here.

19:58.400 --> 20:03.480
Mm. Has anyone seen
a tall, blonde woman
around here lately?

20:03.560 --> 20:05.400
Gone, poof!
Who needs her?

20:05.480 --> 20:09.880
I do. At least
one more time.

21:27.920 --> 21:29.960
Let me put that
there, darlin’.

21:31.480 --> 21:34.640
Mr. Constantine has
left us some wine.

21:34.720 --> 21:37.280
I don't think he likes
the imported stuff.

21:37.360 --> 21:39.240
Uh... It was probably
my veal parmesan.

21:39.320 --> 21:42.640
- I'm afraid I overcooked it.
- He likes eating in a room
with a view, that's all.

21:42.680 --> 21:44.680
You know how fussy
rich people are.

21:44.760 --> 21:48.080
Don't forget
to empty that out.

21:49.240 --> 21:51.120
Don't you think emptying
a chemical toilet...

21:51.160 --> 21:53.320
is below the dignity
of a jewel collector?

21:53.360 --> 21:57.880
- The wages of sin, Arthur.
- I'll do it tomorrow.

21:58.920 --> 22:01.000
Never put off till tomorrow...

22:01.040 --> 22:04.840
what you can empty out tonight.
Bitch.

22:36.760 --> 22:39.320
Arthur, what's
Amsterdam like?

22:39.400 --> 22:41.240
Oh, lots of canals.

22:41.320 --> 22:43.320
<i>Lots of wizened old men...</i>

22:43.400 --> 22:47.760
with sharp eyes,
sitting around cutting
big stones into little ones.

22:47.840 --> 22:49.680
You'll see.

22:54.400 --> 22:57.560
I don't know what's
come over me tonight.
I'm tingling all over.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.800
I told you about danger,
didn't I?

23:01.840 --> 23:04.200
<i>First it makes you sick.</i>

23:04.240 --> 23:07.400
Then, when
you get through it,
it makes you very,

23:07.480 --> 23:09.720
very loving.

23:12.400 --> 23:15.480
<i>Darling, is it...
Hmm?</i>

23:15.560 --> 23:17.520
<i>It was all too easy.
It's frightening.</i>

23:18.640 --> 23:22.040
Brilliant planning.

23:22.120 --> 23:24.280
They don't have
a single lead to follow.

23:25.680 --> 23:28.120
<i>What about the ketamine
we stuck him with?</i>

23:28.200 --> 23:31.720
Well, if Doctor Vogel
didn't miss it six months ago
when I had my wisdom tooth out,

23:31.760 --> 23:33.640
he's not gonna
miss it now.

23:33.680 --> 23:35.880
<i>Don't finish up in there.
Let's go to bed.</i>

23:35.960 --> 23:39.440
<i>Tired?
Mm-mm.
Tingling all over.</i>

23:39.520 --> 23:43.080
How'd I ever let you
get me into all this?

23:43.120 --> 23:47.080
I thought I fell
in love with you because
I needed some stability.

23:47.120 --> 23:49.880
Well, I guess you're just
a bad judge of character.

23:49.960 --> 23:53.280
Where'd you put
the diamond, dear?
Where everyone can see it.

23:53.360 --> 23:55.440
You didn't.
I did.

23:55.520 --> 23:58.920
<i>Are you gonna tell me where?
You'll have
to torture me first.</i>

23:59.000 --> 24:02.040
<i>Oh!
I intend to.</i>

24:02.120 --> 24:03.960
<i>In a few minutes.</i>

24:07.200 --> 24:11.080
Now, with all due
respect to the F.B.I. And
the Bureau of Inspectors,

24:11.120 --> 24:13.320
I have
no time to play games.

24:13.360 --> 24:17.000
Now, lest we forget,
gentlemen, I have been away
from this desk forcibly.

24:17.080 --> 24:18.960
I've got a lot
of work to catch up on.

24:19.000 --> 24:22.320
Now, how many more
times we gonna go through
this goddamn thing?

24:23.600 --> 24:26.000
<i>Until we come up with
something, Mr. Constantine.</i>

24:26.040 --> 24:28.040
That's a hell of a way
to solve a kidnapping.

24:28.120 --> 24:32.400
Mr. Constantine, you're not
the first victim, you know.
There have been others.

24:32.440 --> 24:35.120
<i>All right, all right.
But from me, you'll learn
absolutely nothing.</i>

24:35.200 --> 24:37.520
<i>You never know.
I know.</i>

24:37.600 --> 24:39.640
All right.
Floyd?

24:39.720 --> 24:42.000
Now.
The underground garage.

24:42.080 --> 24:44.680
<i>Full of cars.
Sounds?</i>

24:44.720 --> 24:46.800
- People, behind me.
- Was it a man,
or was it a woman?

24:46.880 --> 24:48.720
<i>I don't know.
Man or woman?</i>

24:48.800 --> 24:50.960
<i>- Man.
- Then what?</i>

24:51.040 --> 24:54.880
It was a prick in my shoulder.
I started to turn.

24:54.960 --> 24:57.320
Eh...
And I woke up
in a room.

24:57.400 --> 25:01.680
<i>Yes, and what did you hear?
Inside or outside?</i>

25:01.720 --> 25:03.880
The room was soundproofed.

25:03.920 --> 25:08.440
I never heard anything
except a disembodied voice
of a loudspeaker.

25:08.520 --> 25:11.240
- Describe it.
- But I've already done that.

25:11.280 --> 25:13.480
Again!

25:13.560 --> 25:16.080
It was the voice
of a man, no accent.

25:16.160 --> 25:20.360
- Doctored up electronically.
Unrecognizable.
- How many of them were there?

25:20.400 --> 25:22.760
Two. A man and a woman.

25:22.800 --> 25:27.840
<i>Why do you say that?
Because the faintest light
filtered down from above.</i>

25:27.920 --> 25:30.320
But not enough
to give me a chance
to see who they were.

25:30.400 --> 25:32.480
- Yes, and who did the cooking?
- She did.

25:32.560 --> 25:36.040
<i>Why?
Because a man would not
bother to put the parsley...</i>

25:36.120 --> 25:38.000
on the filet of sole,
that's why.

25:38.040 --> 25:41.280
- How old is she?
- Come on, now. Please.

25:41.360 --> 25:44.120
<i>How old is she?
Twenty-five.</i>

25:44.200 --> 25:47.160
- Why?
- Why?

25:47.240 --> 25:49.560
Because if a man my age
is gonna get kidnapped
by a woman,

25:49.640 --> 25:51.520
he wants her
to be 25, that's why.

25:53.840 --> 25:56.920
- Describe your return.
- The return.

25:57.000 --> 26:00.920
The disembodied voice
tells me to sit with
my back to the door.

26:01.000 --> 26:04.160
The light goes out,
the door opens,
they both come in.

26:04.240 --> 26:06.920
I feel a prick
in my left arm.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.040
The next thing I know,
I wake up
in that hospital bed...

26:09.120 --> 26:12.400
with you sitting there,
thinking up questions!

26:12.480 --> 26:14.880
Thank you, Mr. Constantine.
You're doing great.

26:14.960 --> 26:19.080
- That's what you think.
- All right, let's start
all over again.

26:19.160 --> 26:21.520
Aw, shit!

26:47.760 --> 26:51.720
<i>Why, Henry, you have such
a beaming smile on your face.</i>

26:51.800 --> 26:53.960
<i>I smile because
I'm happy, Blanche.</i>

26:54.040 --> 26:57.520
<i>It comes through you, Blanche,
from your friend, Ida Cookson.</i>

26:57.600 --> 27:00.200
<i>I'm her guide, Henry.</i>

27:00.240 --> 27:03.720
Friendship can be claimed only
when it cannot be denied.

27:03.760 --> 27:06.600
Tell Ida Cookson
we're all thankful here...

27:06.640 --> 27:09.000
for the warm tranquility
in her heart.

27:09.040 --> 27:12.720
<i>It will grow even warmer
as she trusts in you,</i>

27:12.800 --> 27:17.480
<i>and confides in you, and holds
back no secrets from you...</i>

27:17.520 --> 27:22.040
<i>be they her own, or those
of her intimate friends.</i>

27:22.120 --> 27:24.680
<i>Did you hear that,
Mrs. Cookson?</i>

27:24.720 --> 27:26.600
<i>Yes, Madame Blanche.</i>

27:26.640 --> 27:29.840
<i>Henry, I want you
to seek Walter for us now.</i>

27:33.080 --> 27:36.920
Search through
to the Double Strand
of Kindness, until...

27:37.000 --> 27:40.240
my friend Ida Cookson
is joined in loving
communication...

27:40.320 --> 27:42.360
<i>with her dear,
departed husband.</i>

27:42.440 --> 27:44.560
I will try, Blanche.

27:44.640 --> 27:48.720
But first, the mist
must part a little,
and the veil must rise...

27:48.800 --> 27:52.720
to let in the light
that will show us the path.

27:52.800 --> 27:55.000
Ah, I'm ready now, Henry.

27:55.080 --> 27:59.360
Ready! Ready to follow you,
wherever you want me to go.

27:59.440 --> 28:02.360
Where? Where are
you taking me, Henry?

28:02.440 --> 28:04.560
Yes, yes, yes!
I see.

28:04.640 --> 28:08.040
I see your hand
beckoning to me.

28:08.080 --> 28:11.360
Oh, what a lovely garden,
Henry.

28:11.440 --> 28:14.000
My, my. Oh!

28:14.080 --> 28:16.880
Is that...
Is that a statue there?

28:16.920 --> 28:21.480
Oh! Could this be
Walter standing
beside the fountain?

28:24.120 --> 28:26.000
How can you do this to me?
I need your car keys.

28:26.040 --> 28:27.920
I'm in a hurry.
Oh!

28:27.960 --> 28:30.000
Do you realize what damage
you can do my psyche,
breaking in this way?

28:30.080 --> 28:32.120
Just give me your keys.
I need 'em.

28:32.200 --> 28:34.040
Yes, Henry!
What for?

28:34.120 --> 28:35.960
I've located the daughter
of the Rainbird chauffeur.

28:36.040 --> 28:38.280
And I'm not going
as a cab driver.
Oh!

28:38.320 --> 28:40.720
What am I supposed to do
without my car?
I don't care what you do.

28:40.800 --> 28:44.000
Take a taxi.
Just give me the keys.
The trees are swaying!

28:44.080 --> 28:46.360
And the branches part!

28:46.440 --> 28:48.840
But there's no one there!
Here.

28:48.920 --> 28:51.400
I see shadows falling!
The air is getting cold!

28:51.440 --> 28:54.160
The brightness... dims.
Good-bye, Henry!

28:54.240 --> 28:57.000
Oh!

28:57.080 --> 28:59.880
Did you find Walter?

28:59.920 --> 29:03.080
- Where?
- In the kitchen.

29:04.760 --> 29:06.800
I did.

29:20.320 --> 29:23.600
I wonder if I could speak
to you for a couple minutes,
Mrs. Hannagan.

29:23.680 --> 29:26.280
Why, sure.
Do we know each other?

29:26.320 --> 29:30.240
No, I'm Frank McBride,
of the law firm of Ferguson,
Ferguson & McBride,

29:30.320 --> 29:32.160
and I just wondered
if you would mind...

29:32.240 --> 29:34.800
answering a couple questions
about your background.

29:34.880 --> 29:36.720
<i>My background?
Mm-hmm.</i>

29:36.800 --> 29:38.640
Dull as dishwater.

29:38.720 --> 29:41.320
I mean, what
in the world would you
be wanting with that?

29:41.400 --> 29:43.720
Well, let's just say
that the, uh,

29:43.760 --> 29:47.240
information that
I'm interested in could be
worth a great deal of money.

29:47.320 --> 29:50.360
Oh, yeah?
To who?
Mm-hmm.

29:50.440 --> 29:54.120
Well, we'll get around
to that pleasant little subject
in a minute, if you don't mind.

29:54.200 --> 29:56.080
Okay.
Oh, swell.

29:56.160 --> 29:58.920
Now, why don't we just
start at the beginning?

29:58.960 --> 30:02.040
Your parents.
Oh, they're both dead.
God rest 'em.

30:02.120 --> 30:05.520
Your father was a chauffeur,
though, right?
How did you know that?

30:05.600 --> 30:09.160
He was a chauffeur
for the Rainbird family.

30:09.200 --> 30:13.880
Right again!
You'd be a hell of
a detective, Mr. McBride.

30:13.960 --> 30:16.280
I don't know about that,
my dear.

30:16.360 --> 30:20.160
Now, during this period
of time, though, can you
remember anybody, uh,

30:20.240 --> 30:23.440
being a close friend
of your father's?

30:23.520 --> 30:26.600
Uh, there was a man.
It was away back
when I was in school.

30:26.680 --> 30:29.000
Uh, there was this guy
that my father used to
drink beer with...

30:29.040 --> 30:31.320
and shoot pool with
down in the village.

30:31.400 --> 30:35.880
This Harry Shoebridge
had a poultry shop
with his wife, Sadie.

30:35.960 --> 30:37.840
Shoebridge.

30:37.880 --> 30:40.720
Yeah.
His business
was always lousy,

30:40.760 --> 30:42.560
even when times
were good.

30:42.640 --> 30:44.520
And she used to
have miscarriages...

30:44.560 --> 30:46.920
like other women
have birthdays.

30:46.960 --> 30:49.760
Well, they
stopped trying, and
they moved away...

30:49.840 --> 30:53.200
to Barlow Creek,
and, uh, adopted
a kid, I think.

30:53.280 --> 30:56.360
A boy?
Yeah.
An infant.

30:56.440 --> 30:59.240
But, you know,
I'm not so sure.

30:59.280 --> 31:02.160
I... It's all kind
of hazy, an-and, uh,

31:02.200 --> 31:04.680
I keep connecting
it with...

31:04.760 --> 31:08.440
Well, I remember
this night...

31:08.520 --> 31:10.480
with my Dad driving
over there...

31:10.560 --> 31:13.120
to the Shoebridge's
all alone, and then
getting in...

31:13.200 --> 31:16.240
a big fight with Ma
because he'd come home
at 4:00 A.M.,

31:16.320 --> 31:19.440
and he wouldn't
tell her what he was
doing or something.

31:19.520 --> 31:23.520
Now, after my dad
passed away...
God rest his soul...

31:23.600 --> 31:26.200
my ma was damn mad
at the Shoebridge's,

31:26.280 --> 31:28.640
because they
never showed up
at the funeral.

31:28.720 --> 31:32.440
Then she
found out why.
Why?

31:32.520 --> 31:36.240
<i>A year earlier,
they'd gone to
their own funeral.</i>

31:36.320 --> 31:38.800
Dead?
Mm-hmm.

31:38.880 --> 31:42.440
Their house burned down
with them in it.
Well, what about the son?

31:42.480 --> 31:44.960
<i>Mrs. Hannagan!
Can't you see that
there are customers?</i>

31:45.040 --> 31:47.560
Oh, yes. Yes.
I'll be right there.
She'll be right there, ma'am.

31:47.640 --> 31:51.200
Uh-Uh, look, um,
Mr. McBride,

31:51.280 --> 31:54.000
<i>about all this being
worth something...
Mrs. Hannagan!</i>

31:55.120 --> 31:57.360
Yeah.
Wait a second.

31:57.440 --> 31:59.880
This Shoebridge son...
where do I look for him?

31:59.960 --> 32:02.800
Well, try the Barlow
Creek Cemetery.

32:02.840 --> 32:07.080
What do you mean, the cemetery?
Well, I'm not sure, but
I think he's dead, too.

33:44.960 --> 33:46.800
Sorry!

34:03.280 --> 34:06.320
Dead end, Blanche.

34:06.400 --> 34:08.239
Dead and buried.

34:31.800 --> 34:35.000
Caretaker.
Do somethin' for you?
I'm a friend of the family.

34:37.920 --> 34:42.159
None left.
Bad business, that.

34:42.239 --> 34:44.080
You mean the fire?

34:45.679 --> 34:47.560
Never liked them
multiple funerals.

34:47.600 --> 34:50.000
Too much work involved,
all at one time.

34:51.800 --> 34:54.960
They died together,
yet they're not...

34:55.040 --> 34:57.040
buried together
in the same hole.

34:57.120 --> 34:59.520
How come?

34:59.600 --> 35:02.160
Search me.

35:03.920 --> 35:05.800
Here. Look.

35:17.360 --> 35:21.960
Died in 1950.
Died 1950.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.280
<i>Both died the same date.</i>

35:27.440 --> 35:29.360
Old stone.

35:29.440 --> 35:31.240
This is practically
new stone.

35:34.320 --> 35:37.240
- Smart fellow, ain't ya?
- Why? Have I stumbled
on to something?

35:39.120 --> 35:42.360
Well, nice meetin' ya.

35:42.440 --> 35:46.360
Better get back to my work.
I got a job comin'
in here tomorrow.

35:50.800 --> 35:54.320
<i> </i>

36:04.080 --> 36:06.920
Turn that damn thing
down, Marcella.

36:06.960 --> 36:10.320
Can't even hear
myself think.

36:10.400 --> 36:13.520
How do you expect me
to remember anything
that far back?

36:13.600 --> 36:16.640
I'd have to go through
my old files for that
kind of information.

36:16.720 --> 36:19.000
Well, Mr. Wheeler,
I hate to insist...

36:19.080 --> 36:22.640
You know something,
Mr. McBride?

36:22.720 --> 36:24.720
You lawyers
are all alike.

36:24.800 --> 36:27.160
Trouble,
trouble, trouble.

36:28.720 --> 36:30.600
Well, come on.
I don't have all day.

36:30.640 --> 36:33.320
What year did you say
the family died?

36:33.360 --> 36:35.640
Uh, 1950.

36:35.720 --> 36:38.480
What month?

36:39.600 --> 36:41.480
Ah, I can't
help you there.

36:41.520 --> 36:44.640
Shoebridge. Shoebri...
Yeah, go ahead.
Can I sit down?

36:44.720 --> 36:47.080
Shoebridge.
Shoebridge.

36:47.160 --> 36:51.480
Oh, here it is.
"Shoebridge: Harry and Sadie.

36:51.560 --> 36:54.400
"Large marble.
Model 28.

36:54.480 --> 36:56.840
"Paid in full.
Check number 93.

36:56.880 --> 36:59.560
First Church
of Latter Day Saints,
Barlow Creek."

37:00.920 --> 37:03.760
What about the son?

37:03.800 --> 37:06.840
Edward Shoebridge.
He's their son.
Edward?

37:06.920 --> 37:08.920
Yeah.
Okay. Nope.

37:09.000 --> 37:11.640
Nothing.
What do you mean,
nothing?

37:11.720 --> 37:14.240
There's gotta
be something.
Maybe it came later.

37:14.320 --> 37:16.440
Wait a minute.
You're talking about
Eddie Shoebridge.

37:16.520 --> 37:19.000
His headstone?
Yeah, that did come later.

37:19.080 --> 37:22.600
I think in, uh, '65.

37:22.640 --> 37:24.680
Sure, I remember
that kid.

37:24.720 --> 37:28.400
He wasn't too popular
around here. Some say
he set that fire himself...

37:28.480 --> 37:30.480
to get rid of his family,
and then disappeared...

37:30.560 --> 37:33.320
to make it look like
he died in the fire too.

37:33.400 --> 37:37.160
- They never did find his body.
- You mean, there's no body
in that grave?

37:37.200 --> 37:39.560
Well, as I recollect,
that's why the local parson...

37:39.640 --> 37:41.640
wouldn't say
any services for Eddie.

37:41.720 --> 37:44.520
Well,
Wasn't there
a death certificate?

37:44.560 --> 37:48.520
I wouldn't know about that.
And I don't need to know.

37:48.600 --> 37:50.640
I'm just a businessman,
Mr. McBride.

37:51.680 --> 37:55.280
Ah, here it is.

37:55.360 --> 37:58.520
"Edward Shoebridge.
Granite special.

37:58.600 --> 38:00.760
"Ordered, November 12.

38:00.840 --> 38:04.280
"Paid for,
November 18, 1965.

38:04.360 --> 38:06.200
$395."

38:07.640 --> 38:10.800
Now, that's funny.
It's paid in cash.

38:10.880 --> 38:12.800
<i>They don't
usually do that.
Who was it?</i>

38:12.880 --> 38:14.760
I don't know, Mr. McBride.

38:14.800 --> 38:16.680
I guess he didn't
want his name known.

38:18.280 --> 38:20.640
<i>Well, what
do you mean, he?</i>

38:20.720 --> 38:24.560
<i>- You just said he.
- I did, didn't I?</i>

38:25.920 --> 38:28.640
Well, you know, I seem
to sort of remember...

38:28.720 --> 38:31.280
<i>that it was a man.</i>

38:31.360 --> 38:34.680
Yeah.
A young fella.

38:34.760 --> 38:39.520
Slightly bald. I'd say
in his late twenties.

38:39.600 --> 38:41.760
And did you see him
again when you, uh...

38:41.840 --> 38:43.720
Put in the headstone?

38:43.760 --> 38:47.680
We didn't do that.
He came by and
picked it up himself.

38:47.760 --> 38:51.240
Yes, I remember now.
In one of those tow trucks.

38:51.280 --> 38:54.600
<i>You know, the kind
that garages use?
Gotcha.</i>

38:59.360 --> 39:01.920
<i>No, there is no
death certificate here
for Edward Shoebridge,</i>

39:02.000 --> 39:05.920
only Harry J. Shoebridge
and Sadie L. Shoebridge.

39:07.400 --> 39:10.120
That's all you have?

39:10.160 --> 39:13.280
Well, there is this.

39:13.360 --> 39:16.040
It appears to be
an application for
a death certificate...

39:16.120 --> 39:21.200
for one Edward Shoebridge,
dated November 4, 1965.

39:21.280 --> 39:23.680
"Inasmuch as applicant could
furnish no proof of death...

39:23.760 --> 39:25.640
"for party whose body
had never been found,

39:25.680 --> 39:28.120
"and who could supply
no medical death certificate,

39:28.200 --> 39:31.760
"and nothing from
the coroner's office,
the application was denied.

39:31.840 --> 39:34.440
"Applicant, when informed
he could file a petition
for court action,

39:34.480 --> 39:36.880
declined the suggestion."

39:36.960 --> 39:39.160
Does it say who
the applicant was?

39:39.240 --> 39:41.880
Yes.
"Request was made by
Joseph P. Maloney,

39:41.960 --> 39:44.240
426 Main Street,
Barlow Creek."

39:44.320 --> 39:46.480
Attagirl.
Thank you.
You're welcome.

40:58.800 --> 41:01.000
- Fill 'er up?
- Please.

41:12.360 --> 41:16.000
- You want to check
under the hood?
- If you would, please.

41:24.440 --> 41:29.000
- Better be careful
with those matches.
- Oh. Right.

41:29.040 --> 41:31.080
Sorry.

41:34.200 --> 41:36.520
<i>This your place?
Yeah.</i>

41:37.720 --> 41:41.600
Then you must be,
uh, "J. Maloney."

41:41.680 --> 41:45.960
Tell me, does that
stand for, uh, John or Jim?

41:46.040 --> 41:48.600
- Joe.
- Right.

41:48.680 --> 41:51.040
Everything's okay.

41:56.160 --> 41:58.920
Funny, uh, you didn't
hardly need any gas.

42:00.560 --> 42:04.080
Didn't need no oil...
Guess you didn't come here
for the car, huh, mister?

42:04.160 --> 42:06.000
Could you get
my windshield, please?

42:06.080 --> 42:08.120
Don't worry.

42:11.400 --> 42:15.400
You wouldn't happen
to know a guy by the name
of Edward Shoebridge, would ya?

42:15.480 --> 42:17.360
<i>Used to live around here.</i>

42:20.080 --> 42:21.960
Name don't ring
no bell with me.

42:22.000 --> 42:25.160
<i>What would you be wantin'
with this, uh, what's
his name, uh, Shoebridge?</i>

42:25.200 --> 42:28.520
Yeah.
Legal matter.

42:28.600 --> 42:31.200
<i>You a lawyer?
Yeah.</i>

42:31.280 --> 42:34.200
Name's McBride.
Frank McBride.

42:34.280 --> 42:37.960
- First time I ever talked to
a lawyer didn't cost me money.

42:38.040 --> 42:42.520
Actually, Mr. Maloney,
by talking to me you could
make yourself some money.

42:42.600 --> 42:46.760
- Yeah?
- I'm prepared to pay
a reasonable sum of cash,

42:46.800 --> 42:51.560
right now,
for any information that could
lead me to Eddie Shoebridge.

42:51.640 --> 42:54.640
Where I come from,
lawyers are usually
bad news.

42:54.720 --> 42:57.200
Oh, no.
Not this time.
This time they're good news.

42:57.280 --> 42:59.120
<i>Matter of fact, I think
that Eddie Shoebridge...</i>

42:59.200 --> 43:01.320
<i>would be delighted
when he hears from me.</i>

43:01.400 --> 43:03.440
What are you
gonna tell him?

43:03.520 --> 43:06.800
Well, my client has asked me
to keep that confidential.

43:06.880 --> 43:09.160
Who hired you
to find this guy?

43:10.640 --> 43:14.000
- That's confidential also.
- Sure like to help you,
Mister...

43:14.080 --> 43:16.240
Business ain't
all that good around here.

43:16.320 --> 43:19.480
<i>- I think you can help me.
- Is that right?</i>

43:19.560 --> 43:23.800
Mm-hmm. See, people
around here have been telling me
that Eddie Shoebridge is dead.

43:23.880 --> 43:26.560
Well, if he's dead, looks like
he ain't gonna be hearin...

43:26.640 --> 43:28.480
all that good news
you have to tell him, huh?

43:28.560 --> 43:31.600
<i>I think he's alive.</i>

43:34.000 --> 43:35.880
Sure don't keep
this car very clean.

43:35.920 --> 43:39.480
You want to tell me
why you put a headstone
on an empty grave, Maloney?

43:39.560 --> 43:41.640
What headstone?

43:41.720 --> 43:47.040
The one you paid $395 for
back in 1965.

43:49.040 --> 43:51.160
You owe me $2.47, mister.

43:51.240 --> 43:53.840
Two weeks before that, you went
to the county courthouse...

43:53.920 --> 43:56.840
and asked for a certificate
of death for Edward Shoebridge,

43:56.920 --> 43:58.840
and you were turned down.

44:01.960 --> 44:04.800
You wanna give me
your credit card?
No.

44:04.880 --> 44:07.480
Credit cards are out.

44:13.720 --> 44:17.440
Like you,
I prefer to pay...
in cash.

44:35.280 --> 44:37.880
Now, this one happens
to be my personal favorite.

44:39.960 --> 44:42.320
Isn't it exquisite?

44:42.400 --> 44:45.080
<i>Probably too expensive
for me.</i>

44:45.160 --> 44:47.720
<i>Can I help you, sir?</i>

44:53.520 --> 44:58.040
Excuse me.
I'll be right back.
Uh, Mrs. Clay?

44:58.120 --> 45:00.520
<i>Would you take care
of Mrs. Cunningham
for a few moments?</i>

45:00.600 --> 45:02.760
<i>Certainly, Mr. Adamson.</i>

45:05.200 --> 45:07.560
<i>I'm afraid I rather like it.</i>

45:09.400 --> 45:12.320
Hey, Eddie.
You old son of a bitch.

45:12.400 --> 45:14.600
If it's all the same to you,
I prefer Arthur Adamson.

45:14.640 --> 45:17.600
Now what in the hell
are you doing here?

45:17.680 --> 45:20.720
Had to see you about
something kind of urgent.
That's all, Eddie... Arthur.

45:20.800 --> 45:24.360
- Couldn't you have phoned me?
- Some things you don't
put on no telephone.

45:24.440 --> 45:27.080
<i>Hey, uh, you got
any booze around?</i>

45:34.960 --> 45:37.520
<i>All right, Joseph.
What is it this time?</i>

45:37.600 --> 45:41.040
New freezer
for your wife?

45:41.120 --> 45:44.840
Mother needs another operation?
Bookies threatened
to kill you? What?

45:44.880 --> 45:47.560
Aw, come on, Eddie.
You make me sound
like some kind of sponger.

45:47.600 --> 45:49.520
Not that I ain't grateful
for all your favors.

45:49.560 --> 45:53.480
- Did I ever have a choice?
- Okay, okay. Here it is.

45:53.560 --> 45:56.560
<i>First off, I gotta
ask you a question.</i>

45:56.640 --> 46:01.360
- Go ahead.
- I'm tellin' ya.
No shit now, Eddie.

46:01.440 --> 46:04.040
Can you think of any reason
why anyone would be sniffin'
around in your life...

46:04.080 --> 46:06.640
after all these years?

46:09.640 --> 46:11.480
I can't think of
any reason at all. Why?

46:12.920 --> 46:15.280
Well, there's this guy
comes around the garage today...

46:15.360 --> 46:18.480
tryin' to locate
Eddie Shoebridge.

46:18.560 --> 46:20.680
<i>Claims he's a lawyer,
he's got good news for ya.</i>

46:20.760 --> 46:23.400
Won't say what,
or who he's workin' for.

46:23.480 --> 46:25.800
Calls himself McBride.
I know he's a phony
the minute I see him.

46:25.880 --> 46:29.760
- Police?
- No way.
He's a real amateur.

46:29.840 --> 46:33.160
I traced his license plates
with the bureau...

46:33.200 --> 46:35.400
Doesn’t even drive
his own car.

46:37.520 --> 46:40.520
"Blanche Tyler,
17 Castle Heights Road."

46:43.160 --> 46:47.280
- What did he look like?
He's tall, thin, about 35.

46:47.360 --> 46:49.640
He's always got
a pipe on. Asking a lot
of smart-ass questions.

46:51.760 --> 46:55.240
- What'd you tell him?
- Nothin'. Not a goddamn thing.

46:55.280 --> 46:57.160
I didn't have to.
He knew everything...

46:57.200 --> 46:59.400
<i>fake headstone
you had me put up,</i>

46:59.440 --> 47:02.200
<i>how I tried to get you
officially declared dead.</i>

47:02.280 --> 47:04.560
<i>The son of a bitch says
he thinks you're still alive.</i>

47:04.640 --> 47:07.280
He's lookin’ for you,
Eddie.

47:07.360 --> 47:09.920
And any son of a bitch
who's lookin’ for you...

47:10.000 --> 47:12.040
is lookin’ for me.

47:17.200 --> 47:19.080
Well,

47:19.120 --> 47:22.600
whatever he's up to,
he won't find me.

47:22.640 --> 47:25.200
You worry
too much, Joseph.

47:25.280 --> 47:28.360
Yeah, I worry too much, because
you only planned the fire,

47:28.400 --> 47:31.200
and locked your old man
and old lady in the bedroom.

47:31.280 --> 47:35.600
<i>I poured the gasoline.
I lit the rags.
And I thank you.</i>

47:35.680 --> 47:39.280
The happiest day of
my whole, inglorious childhood.

47:39.360 --> 47:42.640
All right,
you want to kid about it,
it's all right with me.

47:42.720 --> 47:46.160
- I'm gonna track this guy down.
- And then what?

47:47.440 --> 47:49.320
This.

47:51.520 --> 47:55.880
- You'll never change, will you?
- You got no cause to complain.

47:55.960 --> 48:00.880
- When you needed me, I was
always there, wasn’t I?
- Look, put that thing away.

48:00.960 --> 48:04.360
And listen to me.
I want you to go back
to Barlow Creek.

48:04.440 --> 48:06.280
<i>Do nothing, say nothing.</i>

48:06.360 --> 48:09.480
Let me look into this matter
in my own, quiet way.

48:10.800 --> 48:13.840
And if I need you for anything,
I'll contact you.

48:15.600 --> 48:18.160
<i>Okay?</i>

48:21.920 --> 48:23.880
You're the boss, Arthur.

48:23.960 --> 48:27.640
Isn't it touching how...
a perfect murder...

48:27.720 --> 48:30.280
has kept our friendship
alive all these years?

48:31.480 --> 48:33.680
You better believe it.

48:33.760 --> 48:37.200
-
- I'm sorry to disturb you,
Mr. Adamson.

48:37.280 --> 48:40.160
<i>There are two gentlemen
here to see you,
from the police department.</i>

48:42.320 --> 48:44.840
Tell them I'll be right out.

48:44.920 --> 48:46.920
Jesus Christ, Eddie!

48:47.000 --> 48:48.840
Wait here.

49:01.920 --> 49:05.640
Arthur Adamson. What can
I do for you gentlemen?
Sorry to bother you.

49:05.680 --> 49:09.280
Andy Bush, Bureau
of Inspectors, and this
is Lieutenant Peterson.

49:09.360 --> 49:11.200
Hi.
My pleasure.

49:11.280 --> 49:15.040
No doubt you've been
reading, or hearing, about
the Constantine kidnapping.

49:15.120 --> 49:17.240
Well, I have
a confession to make,
Inspector.

49:17.320 --> 49:20.200
When I heard of
the size of that stone,
my mouth watered.

49:20.280 --> 49:22.880
Professionally speaking,
of course.

49:22.960 --> 49:26.360
Well, just so you don't
feel discriminated against,
Mr. Adamson,

49:26.440 --> 49:30.560
we're routinely covering
every gem dealer and
jewelry store in the city.

49:30.640 --> 49:33.440
Well, I'm flattered.

49:33.520 --> 49:38.240
Have you, by any chance,
noticed anything out of
the ordinary, Mr. Adamson?

49:38.320 --> 49:43.640
Any unusual movement of large...
or small... stones into the
markets these last few days?

49:43.720 --> 49:46.520
Absolutely not.
I see.

49:46.600 --> 49:48.440
I take it that you're
going on the assumption...

49:48.520 --> 49:51.480
that this, uh,
"ransom stone" has been
cut up into smaller gems?

49:51.560 --> 49:54.440
That's correct,
sir.
It makes a lot of sense.

49:54.520 --> 49:56.400
We think so.

49:56.480 --> 49:58.880
If I may presume
to make a suggestion,

49:58.960 --> 50:03.080
it seems to me you ought
to be covering the antique
and secondhand jewelry markets.

50:03.160 --> 50:08.080
They buy from anyone, whereas
we jewelers buy exclusively
on the wholesale exchanges.

50:08.160 --> 50:11.200
That's already being done,
Mr. Adamson.
Oh!

50:11.280 --> 50:14.440
I think
we've taken up enough
of Mr. Adamsors time.

50:14.520 --> 50:17.720
Well, I'm sorry
I haven't been able to be
of more help to you.

50:17.800 --> 50:22.240
However, if I do hear
of any unusual transactions
in the marketplace,

50:22.320 --> 50:24.160
I'll be sure
and contact you.

50:24.240 --> 50:27.920
Yes, we'd appreciate that.
Much obliged.
Take care.

50:28.000 --> 50:30.880
Good-bye, sir.
Good day.
And good luck!

50:47.200 --> 50:50.600
Mrs. Clay, close up as
soon as you wish. I have
some work to do in here.

50:50.680 --> 50:52.800
I'll let myself out
the back way.

50:52.880 --> 50:54.720
<i>Good night.
Good night.</i>

52:00.960 --> 52:05.120
<i>Your friend, Blanche Tyler,
is a spiritualist.
A spiritualist?</i>

52:05.200 --> 52:09.320
That's what it says
on her shingle. Also,
there's no one home.

52:09.360 --> 52:12.280
<i>A spirit is never at home.
Get in.</i>

52:17.400 --> 52:19.720
What do you think
we should do?

52:19.800 --> 52:23.520
We'll wait. We still don't
know who the man is yet.

52:23.600 --> 52:25.440
Must you?
Mm-hmm.

52:35.440 --> 52:37.320
That must be her.

53:08.240 --> 53:11.680
That must be
the fellow with the pipe
who called on Maloney.

53:11.760 --> 53:13.600
A cab driver.

53:13.640 --> 53:16.200
Lumley. Lumley,
what's this?
Where are ya goin'?

53:16.280 --> 53:18.920
I'm going home to my own bed
where I can get some sleep.

53:18.960 --> 53:20.840
No, you're not.

53:20.880 --> 53:23.560
Blanche, is that all you've
ever got on your mind?

53:23.640 --> 53:25.920
What are you saving it for,
a rainy day?

53:26.000 --> 53:27.920
Honey, you never know
when you're gonna need it.

53:28.000 --> 53:30.040
You're not
being friendly, Lumley.

53:30.120 --> 53:34.080
Blanche, I'm
too pooped to pop.
I'd be useless to you.

53:34.160 --> 53:36.360
You're always useless to me!

53:36.400 --> 53:39.720
You're always pooping out
when I need you!

53:39.800 --> 53:42.520
<i>... we can collect a huge sum of
money,: You call that useless?</i>

53:42.600 --> 53:45.600
You know what I'm talking about.
Come on inside and
stop being difficult.

53:45.680 --> 53:47.640
Not tonight, Josephine.
I'm outta here.

53:47.720 --> 53:51.520
You're a fink!
If I'm a fink, you're
an ungrateful bitch.

53:51.600 --> 53:53.880
What about tomorrow?
What about it?

53:53.960 --> 53:57.160
You've got important work to do.
I want you to be sure
about Eddie Shoe...

53:57.200 --> 53:59.400
-
- Talk to him!

53:59.440 --> 54:01.680
How many times are you
going to tell me that?

54:01.760 --> 54:06.440
How many times am I gonna
have to tell you that tomorrow
I have to work in my cab?

54:06.520 --> 54:08.400
So it'll wait
till Sunday.

54:25.480 --> 54:28.720
You better give me
a quick synopsis.
I'm confused.

54:28.800 --> 54:30.960
Simple. A cab driver
is shacked up...

54:31.040 --> 54:33.320
with a sex-starved medium
named Blanche Tyler.

54:33.400 --> 54:35.400
Don't ask me why,
but apparently
they're on the trail...

54:35.480 --> 54:37.840
of some spook
named Eddie Shoebridge.

54:37.920 --> 54:41.840
Fortunately, not on
the trail of your favorite
kidnapper and mine.

54:41.920 --> 54:43.760
How can you be so sure?

54:43.840 --> 54:46.600
You did hear him talk
about collecting
a huge hunk of money.

54:46.680 --> 54:49.360
Couldn’t that be the reward
that's on our heads?

54:49.440 --> 54:51.840
You got yourself a point
there, Francés, old girl.

54:51.920 --> 54:54.640
Only time will tell
whether it's any good.

54:54.720 --> 54:56.560
One thing's certain.

54:56.640 --> 55:00.000
We're not going to change
our game plan. Not now.

55:01.680 --> 55:03.520
Buy me a drink, Arthur.

55:05.040 --> 55:06.760
A shiny car.

55:06.840 --> 55:09.520
A... limousine?

55:09.600 --> 55:11.920
Why does he drive
so fast, Henry?

55:12.000 --> 55:14.880
<i>What's that?
On the seat beside him?</i>

55:14.920 --> 55:20.280
<i>I hear the sound of a baby
crying. Quick, Henry,
before he disappears.</i>

55:20.360 --> 55:23.520
Ask... Yes, I know.

55:23.560 --> 55:27.720
I... see him now.

55:27.800 --> 55:31.400
The uniform.
A chauffeur.

55:31.480 --> 55:34.000
What?
Henry, I need words.

55:34.080 --> 55:35.920
Who?
The what?

55:36.000 --> 55:39.160
The Rainbird chauffeur?

55:39.240 --> 55:42.720
Good heavens.
Old Michael O'Keefe,
our chauffeur.

55:42.760 --> 55:45.480
<i>Where is Michael going?</i>

55:45.520 --> 55:49.360
<i>Henry, ask him where
he's taking Harriet's baby.</i>

55:49.440 --> 55:52.040
Oh, more pictures
are coming in too fast.

55:52.120 --> 55:54.720
I can hardly
make them out.

55:54.800 --> 55:57.960
Henry, a graveyard,
a headstone?

55:58.000 --> 56:00.280
<i>I don't like this,
Henry.</i>

56:00.360 --> 56:03.160
<i>A shoe. Bridge.</i>

56:03.240 --> 56:07.240
A shoe bridge?
Oh, don't do this
to me, Henry.

56:07.280 --> 56:10.720
<i>Speak to the chauffeur.
Oh, God,
something's burning.</i>

56:10.800 --> 56:14.600
<i>The house.
Quick, Henry.
The house is on fire.</i>

56:14.640 --> 56:16.880
Take me away from here.

56:16.960 --> 56:18.840
I don't want to see this.

56:18.920 --> 56:22.360
I can't bear the sound
of their awful screaming.

56:22.440 --> 56:25.480
Go back to the chauffeur, Henry.
Get Michael into our presence.

56:25.520 --> 56:27.480
Miss Rainbird remembers him.

56:27.560 --> 56:30.520
Yes, I remember.

56:30.600 --> 56:33.160
Madame Blanche,
listen to me.

56:33.200 --> 56:36.880
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

56:36.960 --> 56:40.840
I've remembered something else
that could be
terribly important.

56:40.920 --> 56:44.160
Wait one minute, Henry.
Before you go,

56:44.200 --> 56:48.280
Miss Rainbird deserves
some kind of assurance
about Harriet's child.

56:48.360 --> 56:50.920
<i>He's a man by now,</i>

56:51.000 --> 56:54.280
<i>and we have to know,
is he happy, Henry?</i>

56:54.320 --> 56:57.440
Is he alive and well
and happy?

56:59.280 --> 57:01.400
If you can't,
you can't.

57:01.480 --> 57:04.040
<i>I certainly
can't force you.</i>

57:04.120 --> 57:08.000
Yes. Of course
she'll understand.

57:08.080 --> 57:12.040
<i>Until next time, then.
Good-bye.</i>

57:12.120 --> 57:13.960
Good-bye, my love.

57:17.440 --> 57:19.840
- What happened?
- Don't you remember?

57:21.680 --> 57:25.320
- Not a blessed thing.
- Oh, it doesn't matter now.

57:25.400 --> 57:27.760
Listen, listen,
Madame Blanche.

57:27.840 --> 57:32.280
Your Henry jogged
my memory of something
I'd completely forgotten.

57:32.360 --> 57:36.240
When our poor old chauffeur,
Mike, realized he was dying,

57:36.320 --> 57:40.280
he wrote to me and said
there was one person on earth...

57:40.360 --> 57:43.080
who had promised that
he'd make it his business...

57:43.120 --> 57:47.400
to know where Harriet's son was
as long as he lived.

57:47.440 --> 57:52.440
It was the parson
who baptized the newborn baby.

57:52.520 --> 57:55.160
And there's an additional thing
I can tell you.

57:56.200 --> 57:59.560
Don't tell me.
Let me guess.

57:59.640 --> 58:02.960
Five hundred.
Not a penny. Not even
a hundred for expenses.

58:03.040 --> 58:04.880
It's all or nothing,
George,

58:04.960 --> 58:07.320
until I can produce his name
and his present address.

58:07.400 --> 58:11.360
Jesus, Blanche.
However, she gave me
a marvelous clue.

58:11.400 --> 58:14.200
Here we go again.
No, here you go again...

58:14.280 --> 58:17.120
to the man who might tell you
if Shoebridge is dead or alive.

58:17.160 --> 58:21.080
Who's that?
Bishop Wood
at St. Anselm's Cathedral.

58:21.160 --> 58:23.880
Holy Christ, Blanche.
No, George, not him.

58:23.960 --> 58:26.400
Bishop Wood
at St. Anselm's Cathedral.

58:26.480 --> 58:30.280
He was a parson once
and he baptized
the Shoebridge baby.

59:16.600 --> 59:18.440
Excuse me.

59:22.160 --> 59:24.040
Sorry.

59:24.080 --> 59:28.240
Do you know how
I could, uh, make a date
to see Bishop Wood?

59:28.320 --> 59:33.120
If you want to make the
appointment today, you'll have
to make it through the chaplain.

59:33.160 --> 59:35.560
Which one is the chaplain?

59:35.640 --> 59:38.280
When the service is over,
I'll show you where to go.

01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:02.480
Oh, dear.

01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:46.560
You know he's moving.
You sure you gave him enough?

01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:50.120
Just the usual dose.
He looks so harmless.

01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:53.160
<i>When I was a little kid
living in that village,</i>

01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:55.920
<i>he always made me feel
like I was something evil.</i>

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:59.720
- And look at me now.
- I feel years younger.

01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:02.720
You know, one more
like this one today,
and we'll be naturally gray.

01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:06.920
It was an incredible job.
I really think it's worth
more than a million.

01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:09.480
I'm sorry, darling,
but I'm not going back...

01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:12.200
and rewrite my ransom note
that I left in my prayer book.

01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:15.080
You'll have to be a good sport
and settle for a million.

01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:17.680
You were beautiful, Fran.
Just beautiful.

01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:21.320
<i>I was scared.
I told you it'd
be all right, didn't I?</i>

01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:24.000
People in church are inhibited.

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:26.280
They don't jump up and run
around and make a lot of noise.

01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:28.320
They're all
too religiously polite.

01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:30.920
Shall we go on
congratulating ourselves,

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
or would you like
to talk about him now?

01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:35.640
- Who?
- "Who."

01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:38.240
The man with the pipe.

01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:42.320
<i>So you saw him there,
huh?
Larger than life.</i>

01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:44.240
Larger than death,
you mean.

01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:46.440
<i>There's no doubt about
who he's after now.</i>

01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:48.680
What were you planning
to do about him, dear,

01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:50.800
<i>besides just not telling me?</i>

01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:54.200
I'm not planning
to do anything about him.

01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:57.600
Joe Maloney's been
itching for that job.
He's got it.

01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:01.120
<i>I'll phone him as soon as we
put our guest in his quarters.</i>

01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:04.440
I was right about
that silly cab driver.

01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:06.760
For once in my life
I hate being right.

01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:08.800
Well, how in the hell
could he have known
we were going to be there...

01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:11.600
when you and I are the only
two people in the world
who knew that?

01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:13.520
I've got a thought.

01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:16.080
<i>It's a dumb one.
Say it.</i>

01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:18.120
Do you believe
in E.S.P.?

01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:21.400
Extra sensory perception,
all that psychic phenomena?

01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:24.200
What do you mean?
Madame What's-her-name?

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:26.600
Blanche Tyler.

01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:28.760
Jesus.

01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:33.520
You and I know that that's
off the wall, but, uh,
can we afford to be wrong?

01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:39.240
I'm afraid our two quarrelsome
lovers are going to have to
share a fatal accident.

01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:41.160
Oh, my God.

01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:44.760
But Maloney wouldn't be
willing to do that,
would he?

01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:48.360
Of course he'd be willing.
Gladly.

01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:52.200
He'd believe he was protecting
himself and his old buddy.

01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:55.080
I don't want to know
about it. Okay?

01:02:55.160 --> 01:02:58.160
<i>Promise me, Arthur.
Come on, now, dear.</i>

01:02:58.240 --> 01:03:01.400
That's what's so exciting
about all of this.

01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:04.880
We move as one.
Everything together.
Nothing held back.

01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:38.800
It was gross negligence,
losing him that way.
He was all we had.

01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:41.200
I didn't lose him.
He was kidnapped.

01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:47.080
Why would anyone want
to do that to a bishop?

01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:50.120
For the ransom, dummy.
It's a million dollars.

01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:57.760
I can't get over it.
You know, I was right there.

01:03:57.840 --> 01:04:01.920
Tsk. Oh, forget about
the million.
What about out 10,000?

01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:06.640
We've got nowhere
to go now, Lumley.

01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:10.720
What am I gonna tell
Miss Rainbird?

01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:15.160
I suppose Henry and I are going
to have to exhaust ourselves
again doing your work for you.

01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:17.600
What d'ya mean, my work?
My work is driving
a goddamn cab,

01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:19.520
for Christ's sake.

01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:21.880
And startin’ right
this minute, that's exact...

01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:24.880
That's exact what?
Go ahead.
Answer the telephone.

01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:32.960
Hello? Who?

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Mr. Maloney?

01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:38.080
Barlow Creek?
Go ahead.

01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:41.080
Hello.

01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:43.600
Can you speak a little louder,
Mr. Maloney?

01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:47.960
I said I traced you through
the license plates on that car
your lawyer friend was driving.

01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:50.920
I figured if you was still
lookin’ for some dope
on Eddie Shoebridge,

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.320
I might have
somethin’ for you.
Oh.

01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:56.000
How come you changed your mind,
Mr. Maloney?

01:04:56.040 --> 01:05:00.040
I didn't say nothin’ to your man
'cause I felt it was none of
my business and none of his,

01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:02.440
but I been thinkin’ about it
and how I could use the bread.

01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:05.000
So for a little consideration,
I'm willing to lead you
to someone...

01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:07.040
who knows
Eddie Shoebridge's wife.

01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:09.920
It'll cost you a grand.

01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:12.520
Oh, don't be silly,
Mr. Maloney.

01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:14.640
I have my lawyer
right here beside me,

01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:18.400
and he says
he'll give you $100
provided it leads to something.

01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:21.160
Make it two.

01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:24.560
Oh... All right.
It's a deal.

01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:27.000
Where do we meet?
You and that
lawyer friend of yours,

01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:29.680
you drive up and meet me
at Abe and Mabel's
in two hours.

01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:34.320
<i>Abe and Mabel's?
It's a cafe up the road
to Mt. Sherman,</i>

01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:37.120
about five miles
off Route 22.

01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:39.080
You know where it is?
Yeah.
Why so far away?

01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:41.440
Can't we meet somewhere
more convenient?

01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:44.960
This party I'm gonna
take you to happens to be
up in that area.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:48.960
I see. Mr. Maloney, are you
admitting Edward Shoebridge
is still alive?

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:52.200
I ain't sayin’ a thing
till I see the color
of your money, in two hours.

01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:57.520
What d'ya think?
Smells fishy to me.

01:05:57.600 --> 01:05:59.440
I know.

01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:03.000
But even fish smells good
when you're starving to death.

01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:05.400
What have we got to lose?
He's the only clue left.

01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:09.280
You got $200 on you?

01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:11.240
You know me better than that.

01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:15.200
Of course not.
Fix me another one of these.

01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:19.440
You don't need another one.
You already got one. We only
got two hours to get there.

01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:22.480
- I'll eat it in the car.
- Come on.

01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:24.360
You're impossible.

01:07:54.080 --> 01:07:55.920
A couple of beers,
please.

01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:03.680
He must be late.

01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:29.760
Thank you, dear.

01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:41.520
You kids sit over there.

01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:52.319
How was Sunday school
today?
Noisy.

01:08:52.359 --> 01:08:54.960
Five Cokes, please.
We didn't make any noise.

01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:56.880
That's right.
That's why you're here.

01:09:21.479 --> 01:09:23.520
Don't blame me.

01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:25.479
Did I say anything?

01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:35.439
Hello.
I'm sorry I'm late.
I'll get you a chair.

01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:38.319
That's all right.
I'll sit over here.
I'll join you.

01:09:46.399 --> 01:09:49.200
Look at that.
Nice arrangement.

01:09:49.279 --> 01:09:51.800
Don't be obscene,
George.

01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:01.720
Oh.

01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:03.640
Thank you, my dear.

01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:11.480
Just see that you keep you head
screwed on straight, will you?

01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:16.800
Ah!

01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:25.000
He's not coming.

01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:39.400
Well, that's
the end of that.

01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:53.320
George, what's
the big hurry?

01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:01.560
Just slow down a little,
will ya, please?

01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:06.320
I told you not to drive
so fast, George!

01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:08.880
I don't know what's wrong.
The accelerator seems
to be sticking.

01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:13.840
George, for God's sake,
slow up, will ya?

01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:15.840
I can't.

01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:18.160
My hamburger's coming up.

01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:21.000
The accelerator...
is stuck.

01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:22.920
Use the brakes!

01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:27.400
They don't work.
What?

01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:31.800
The brakes don't work.
What do you mean?

01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:39.520
George!
Come on, woman. Don't
grab me, for God's sake!

01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:41.600
It's not me.
It's the brakes don't work.

01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:45.240
I'm getting violently ill,
George.

01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:48.920
You're chokin’ me, Blanche,
for Christ's sake!
George!

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:52.200
<i>Do something!</i>

01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:01.760
Grab the brake!
Reach down and pull
the hand brake.

01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:03.800
<i>Pull on it!
I am pulling!</i>

01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:05.880
<i>Get your hands off
the steering wheel.
Pull on it!</i>

01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:07.800
I am pulling.
Pull it.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:11.880
Come on.

01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:15.560
Get your hand off
the goddamn wheel!

01:13:56.520 --> 01:13:59.360
I gotta get off this road.

01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:04.240
Blanche, just hang on.

01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:18.000
Wasn’t that fun?

01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:21.200
Damn you,
George Lumley!
What's the matter with you?

01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:23.880
It wasn’t me.
It's Maloney.
He wasn’t driving!

01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:26.760
Of course, but he screwed up
the car and broke the brakes.

01:15:26.840 --> 01:15:29.040
Maloney?
Yes.

01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:32.120
You think it's
a coincidence, Blanche?

01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:34.040
Huh?

01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:39.960
Your car... is gonna be
out of commission
for a couple days.

01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:43.560
So let's go find us
another way to get home.

01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:48.440
George.
Are you all right?

01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:52.040
Mm-hmm. I think so.
How about you?

01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:55.320
I'm okay. I'm sorry.

01:15:57.920 --> 01:16:01.880
Do you really think
Maloney wanted us dead?
Mm-hmm.

01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:06.920
Why, in the name
of God, would anyone
want to do that to us?

01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:08.840
I don't know,

01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:12.680
but you can bet is has something
to do with your mysterious
friend, Eddie Shoebridge.

01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:15.360
Maloney's probably got him
buried in his backyard.

01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:18.040
Doesn’t want us to find out.

01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:47.480
That way.

01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:25.360
Hi there.
Sorry I'm late.

01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:29.000
Congratulations on the nice job
you did on our car, Maloney.

01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:32.040
What are you two doin'
standin’ in the middle
of the road?

01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:35.000
You know perfectly well
what we're doing on the road,
Maloney.

01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:38.400
You must be Blanche Tyler.
Pleased to meet ya.
Where's your car?

01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:41.360
Let's just say it
ain't in runnin’ order,
you know what I mean?

01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:43.480
Hop in. I'll give ya
a lift to the nearest station.

01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:46.360
No, thank you.
We don't ride in hearses.

01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:49.800
You think I came up here
for the fun of it?

01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:52.320
Then you want me to take you
to this party that knows
Eddie Shoebridge's wife.

01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:57.200
Why don't you just go ahead,
uh, by yourself this time,
Maloney. We'll skip it.

01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:09.200
He's all charm.

01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:54.280
<i>Who's that?</i>

01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:57.000
That's Maloney.
He's after us.

01:18:57.040 --> 01:18:59.720
Come on.

01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:10.160
Hey, guys, let's get
the hell outta here.

01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:40.760
We better get the police.

01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:45.080
And lose our $10,000?

01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:14.160
May I be of some help
to you, madam?

01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:18.240
I'd like to see
some bracelets.
Any particular kind?

01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:21.800
Do you have anything
with turquoise,
or perhaps pearls?

01:20:29.560 --> 01:20:32.320
Anything wrong
with our houseguest?
He's fine.

01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:36.680
I gave him a very nice lunch
and a fresh bottle of wine.

01:20:36.760 --> 01:20:40.480
Maybe one of these
will appeal to you?
Are those seed pearls?

01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:42.400
That's right.

01:20:45.640 --> 01:20:49.320
What are you doing here?
These look like
freshwater pearls.

01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:53.200
The message has
come through on KFAG.

01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:55.880
<i>They've located
the stone we asked for.</i>

01:20:55.960 --> 01:20:58.160
<i>In New York.
Harry Winston.</i>

01:20:58.240 --> 01:21:00.080
Fifty-three carats.

01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:04.840
These are very nice.
How much are they?

01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:09.720
$315, including tax.

01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:12.200
When do we make
the pickup?

01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:14.920
Tomorrow night, 9:30.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:18.200
Good. Now go on home.

01:21:18.280 --> 01:21:21.000
Would it be possible for you
to set these aside...

01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:23.160
<i>so that I can
bring in my husband
and he can look at them?</i>

01:21:23.240 --> 01:21:25.080
Of course, madam.

01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:28.680
Now for the bad news.

01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:30.920
<i>Take a look at this.</i>

01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:47.600
Incompetent bastard.
He blew it.

01:21:47.680 --> 01:21:51.200
<i>Now we'll have to
eliminate these two ourselves.</i>

01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:54.440
- Ourselves?
- That's right.

01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:57.680
Tomorrow night,
right after we return our guest.

01:21:59.560 --> 01:22:01.680
- I can't.
- You must.

01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:08.120
Remember:
Share and share alike.

01:22:08.200 --> 01:22:11.640
You stop it! Stop it!

01:22:16.040 --> 01:22:18.720
Decide on something?
That'll be fine.

01:22:18.760 --> 01:22:20.760
I'll have it wrapped.

01:22:20.840 --> 01:22:24.320
<i>But it was more than that,
much more than that...</i>

01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:28.200
that you left behind
as your precious gift
to life.

01:22:28.280 --> 01:22:32.680
Yes, Joseph Maloney,
you were a generous man.

01:22:32.760 --> 01:22:35.080
<i>You gave of
your heart and soul.</i>

01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:37.600
<i>You gave the very best
that was in you,</i>

01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:41.600
<i>and no more than that
can be asked of mortal man
on this earth.</i>

01:22:41.680 --> 01:22:44.360
<i>You loved your wife dearly.</i>

01:22:44.440 --> 01:22:47.320
You bestowed upon
your dear mother and father...

01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:50.880
all the care,
all the attention,

01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:53.000
<i>patience and comfort
that they needed...</i>

01:22:53.080 --> 01:22:55.040
<i>in the sunset of their lives.</i>

01:22:56.280 --> 01:22:58.640
And those of us
who are left behind...

01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:01.080
to grieve for you, Joseph,

01:23:01.160 --> 01:23:04.880
<i>can only bow to the divine
judgement of our Lord,</i>

01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:08.320
<i>who has chosen to take you
away from us...</i>

01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:11.800
<i>in this cruel accident.</i>

01:23:11.880 --> 01:23:15.240
Oh, how great
the holiness of our God.

01:23:15.320 --> 01:23:18.120
For He knoweth all things.

01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:21.760
And there is not anything
save He knows it.

01:23:21.800 --> 01:23:24.520
And He cometh
into the world...

01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:30.120
that He may save all men if they
will harken unto His voice.

01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:34.040
<i>For behold, He suffered
that the pains of all men.</i>

01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:37.760
<i>Yea, the pains
of every living creature,</i>

01:23:37.800 --> 01:23:40.440
<i>both men, women and children...</i>

01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:56.080
Can't you
leave me alone?

01:23:56.160 --> 01:23:58.320
Isn't it enough
that you killed him?

01:23:58.400 --> 01:24:01.880
That's not so, Mrs. Maloney.
It was the other way.

01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:04.760
You. You started
it all coming here...

01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:07.360
and messing in things
that were none of your business.

01:24:07.400 --> 01:24:09.840
Now go away.
Please!

01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:12.240
Mrs. Maloney, I have
to talk to you.
He's dead and buried.

01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:14.280
There's nothing
to talk about.
Why didn't he want me...

01:24:14.360 --> 01:24:16.960
looking for
Eddie Shoebridge?
I am not listening to you.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.520
Get away from me!
Mrs. Maloney, your husband
tried to kill me,

01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:21.600
and you were in on it,
weren’t you?
No.

01:24:21.680 --> 01:24:25.360
Then why are you always running
away from me? Is that why?
No.

01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:28.960
Do you realize
that you are an accessory
to an attempted murder?

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:33.200
I had nothing to do with that.
Perhaps the police
would think that you did.

01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:36.880
You want me to go
to the police about it?
For God's sake.

01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:41.640
You wouldn't do that...
Just tell me
where is Eddie Shoebridge?

01:24:41.720 --> 01:24:45.960
I can't.
Mrs. Maloney, where is he?
Please tell me.

01:24:48.440 --> 01:24:52.120
There is no Eddie Shoebridge.

01:24:52.200 --> 01:24:57.040
He went up in smoke
25 years ago and
came down in the city.

01:24:57.120 --> 01:25:01.200
He calls himself
Arthur Adamson.

01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:03.120
Arthur Adamson?

01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:08.560
If he finds out I told you,
he'll kill me.

01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:12.680
Now go away, and don't ever
come near me again.

01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:19.280
Fake! Fake!

01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:35.240
Wait a second, now.
You're the one
that's exaggerating.

01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:38.800
No, I'll give you two or
three days maybe I missed,
but never more than that.

01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:42.040
- Tell him it's deeply important.
- Shh!

01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:44.520
- Stand up.
- Why me?

01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:47.560
What makes you think that
it's me that ran up
all the extra mileage?

01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:52.680
What about that little
asshole, Herbie, or, uh, Al,
the one on the day shift?

01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:56.120
<i>I understand.
I'll be there.</i>

01:25:56.200 --> 01:25:58.120
<i>Yes, I promise
I'll be there.</i>

01:26:01.920 --> 01:26:03.800
The answer's no.

01:26:03.880 --> 01:26:07.200
<i>He says I must work the shift,
and I must work it tonight.</i>

01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:09.440
And do me a favor,
Blanche.

01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:11.760
Please don't
give me a hard time.

01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:13.760
You didn't put up
much of a fight.

01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:17.440
Honey, look. After all
the goofin’ off I've been
doin’ on your behalf,

01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:22.120
I'm within a gnat's eyelash
of losin’ my cab and gettin'
kicked right out of the company.

01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:24.840
Lumley, you're thick!
You won't have to
drive a cab...

01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:27.760
if you can get this thing
over and done with
and collect the money.

01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:30.080
"If," darling.
You're always givin’ me ifs.

01:26:30.120 --> 01:26:32.000
I can't eat ifs
and neither can you,

01:26:32.040 --> 01:26:35.040
while Julia Rainbird and you
are waltzin’ around
in the great beyond.

01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:38.120
Come on, sweetheart. The least
I can do is show up for work
every now and then.

01:26:38.200 --> 01:26:40.320
After all, didn't I give you
the guy's name?

01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:42.520
But the phone book is full
of Arthur Adamsons.

01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:46.280
It's very simple.
All you need to do
is find out the right one.

01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:49.120
That's a snap.
The one that's
close to 40 years old...

01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:51.120
and trembles a little bit
at the name Eddie Shoebridge.

01:26:51.200 --> 01:26:54.080
Easy. We do that tomorrow.
Now would be much better.

01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:57.040
A bird in the hand,
Lumley. Please.
Oh, sweetheart.

01:26:57.120 --> 01:26:59.160
The only bird that's
gonna be in my hand...

01:26:59.240 --> 01:27:01.120
and I'm very sorry
to say this...

01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:03.400
is a steering wheel
from 4:00 to midnight.

01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:07.720
Sure.
Why should I get a kiss?

01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:10.200
Just when I was
beginning to think
you weren’t impossible.

01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:12.120
Maybe I'll do it
without you.

01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:14.160
The hell you will!

01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:16.080
Come on, now. Please.

01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:19.160
This Shoebridge fellow's
gone to a lot of trouble
not to be found.

01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:22.400
<i>Now you got no idea what kind
of trouble you could get into.</i>

01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:24.840
Whatever it is,
he'll forget about it...

01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:27.240
when he hears about
the millions he's coming into.

01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:29.320
Oh, Blanche, come on.

01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:33.560
Just sit down on your
pretty little... behind.

01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:35.880
And I must say,
it is quite an...

01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:38.280
No, it is.
Very attractive
little behind.

01:27:38.360 --> 01:27:40.360
Just wait for me,
okay?

01:27:40.440 --> 01:27:44.880
And tonight when I get home,
we will, uh...

01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:48.280
Right. Very nice.
Plot our strategy.

01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:50.320
Know what I mean,
darlin’?

01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:06.960
Who needs him.

01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:20.400
You wouldn't be
Arthur Adamson,
would you?

01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:22.320
Excuse me.

01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:29.440
Excuse me!

01:28:32.160 --> 01:28:35.000
Hello. Are you
Arthur Adamson?

01:28:35.080 --> 01:28:36.920
Hey, Art!

01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:40.520
Yeah?

01:28:54.280 --> 01:28:56.120
A.A.?

01:29:04.760 --> 01:29:06.600
I'm sorry.
We're just closing.

01:29:06.680 --> 01:29:10.920
I understand.
I'm not shopping.
Is Mr. Adamson around?

01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:13.480
I'm afraid not. But if you
come back tomorrow...

01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:15.480
All right.

01:29:15.560 --> 01:29:17.960
But just to be sure I have
the right Mr. Adamson,

01:29:18.040 --> 01:29:22.400
he is a gentleman
of about 40, I trust?
Yes, that's about right.

01:29:22.480 --> 01:29:25.440
Oh, that's
the first encouraging news
I've had all afternoon.

01:29:25.520 --> 01:29:28.200
Isn't there someplace
I might reach him
without delay?

01:29:28.280 --> 01:29:30.120
You mean tonight?
Yes.

01:29:30.200 --> 01:29:33.320
Well, he usually goes
directly home from here.

01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:36.680
But tonight would be
very bad because I believe
he's giving a party.

01:29:36.760 --> 01:29:39.800
I know he left unusually
early for some such reason.

01:29:39.880 --> 01:29:42.400
Isn't there something
I can tell him for you
in the morning?

01:29:42.440 --> 01:29:45.880
This is personal.
Rather personal.
Oh, I see.

01:29:45.960 --> 01:29:49.160
Perhaps you'd like
to leave him a note.

01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:51.280
A note? Very good.
Yes. Come this way.

01:29:53.280 --> 01:29:55.120
Excuse me.

01:29:57.360 --> 01:29:59.240
Thank you.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.280
Is anything the matter?

01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:16.760
Uh, I was, uh,
just thinking.

01:30:16.840 --> 01:30:19.520
Instead of leaving
this note here,

01:30:19.560 --> 01:30:23.560
it might be better
if I sent Mr. Adamson
a telegram tonight.

01:30:23.640 --> 01:30:26.680
<i>What's his address,
please?
Well, I don't...</i>

01:30:26.760 --> 01:30:29.960
It's all right.
We're friends.

01:30:30.040 --> 01:30:32.440
- 1001 Franklin Street.
- 1001 Franklin.

01:30:32.520 --> 01:30:35.160
Thank you very much.
You've been very kind.

01:30:38.080 --> 01:30:40.120
You're a Capricorn,
aren't you?

01:30:40.200 --> 01:30:42.040
No, I'm a Leo.

01:30:43.320 --> 01:30:46.200
That's what I thought.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:02.880
Pete, hi.
Hello, there,
Blanche, baby.

01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:06.680
Have you seen George?
He just left a few minutes ago,
but he'll be back.

01:31:06.760 --> 01:31:09.040
Took a party of four
out to River Valley.

01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:12.000
Oh, dear. That could
take all night.
Easily. What's up?

01:31:12.080 --> 01:31:14.280
Would you give him
a message for me?
Sure thing.

01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:16.800
Just tell him
I found him.
You found him?

01:31:16.840 --> 01:31:20.840
That's right.
He lives at 1001 Franklin.
1001 Franklin.

01:31:20.920 --> 01:31:23.280
That's where he lives,
and that's where I'm going now.

01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:25.920
You found him, and
that's where he lives, and
that's where you're going now.

01:31:25.960 --> 01:31:27.880
Thanks, Pete.
Any time, Blanche.

01:31:37.400 --> 01:31:40.040
You wanna go over
the new pickup spot once again?

01:31:40.080 --> 01:31:42.200
I know it by heart.

01:31:42.280 --> 01:31:45.480
Are you all right?

01:31:45.520 --> 01:31:47.880
I will be.
You sure?

01:31:51.560 --> 01:31:54.840
Have to be there at 9:30.
Let's get going.

01:32:31.360 --> 01:32:33.640
Bishop Wood,
it's time to go.

01:32:33.680 --> 01:32:35.760
Have you your vestments on?

01:32:35.840 --> 01:32:38.680
Yes, but I haven't
finished the chicken.

01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:43.680
I'm sorry, Your Excellency.

01:32:43.760 --> 01:32:45.800
Here's what
I want you to do.

01:32:45.880 --> 01:32:48.040
Place the armchair
in the center of the room...

01:32:48.120 --> 01:32:52.000
facing away from the door
and seat yourself in it.

01:32:52.040 --> 01:32:55.440
You're going to be
comfortably put to sleep.

01:32:55.520 --> 01:32:58.720
But it'll last only
for a short while.

01:32:58.760 --> 01:33:03.320
Thank you very much.
You are most considerate.

01:33:03.400 --> 01:33:06.120
Let me know
when you're ready.

01:33:06.160 --> 01:33:09.120
By the way. I haven't quite
finished that book...

01:33:09.160 --> 01:33:11.400
you were kind enough
to let me have.

01:33:11.440 --> 01:33:13.680
May I, uh,
take it along?

01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:19.040
With our fingerprints on it?
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

01:33:19.080 --> 01:33:22.080
Nice try,
Your Excellency.

01:33:22.120 --> 01:33:27.040
Thank you.
Don't bother, then.
I'm ready.

01:33:27.120 --> 01:33:29.440
All right, I'll be
turning your light off now.

01:33:54.520 --> 01:33:57.520
We mustn’t be late.
See who it is,
and be careful.

01:34:27.240 --> 01:34:30.240
It's her. That woman.
Blanche Tyler.

01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:33.560
This is incredible!

01:34:33.640 --> 01:34:36.600
Is that cab driver
with her?
She's alone.

01:34:38.760 --> 01:34:41.760
If I didn't have to make
this pickup in 35 minutes...

01:34:41.800 --> 01:34:44.240
What are we going to do?

01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:46.520
Nothing!

01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:48.400
Until later tonight.

01:35:00.680 --> 01:35:03.320
- She's gone.
- Come on. Let's go.

01:35:03.400 --> 01:35:05.240
<i>Hurry, hurry, hurry!</i>

01:36:18.680 --> 01:36:21.480
I thought you said...
I know.

01:36:21.520 --> 01:36:24.360
- Mr. Adamson?
- Watch him.

01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:34.520
Oh, Mr. Adamson.
How lucky I am
not to have missed you.

01:36:34.600 --> 01:36:37.400
Apparently you didn't hear me
at the front door.
Apparently.

01:36:37.480 --> 01:36:41.120
I am Madame Blanche Tyler,
the spiritualist.

01:36:41.160 --> 01:36:43.360
Good evening, honey.

01:36:43.400 --> 01:36:47.040
Madame Blanche, I wonder if I
might suggest to you to remove
your car from our driveway.

01:36:47.080 --> 01:36:49.880
We're terribly late
for an appointment.
Well, yes.

01:36:49.960 --> 01:36:54.240
When you hear why
I've come, Mr. Adamson...
Or should I say Shoebridge?

01:36:54.280 --> 01:36:56.400
You won't mind
being late at all.
My dear lady,

01:36:56.480 --> 01:36:58.520
I know exactly why
you've come here.
How could you?

01:36:58.600 --> 01:37:01.960
<i>- And exactly why you and
your friend, that cab driver...
- You know George?</i>

01:37:02.040 --> 01:37:06.920
Have been sniffing along my
trail like two eager bloodhounds
these past few weeks.

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.160
I had no idea,
Mr. Adamson.

01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:12.240
All right, Madame Blanche,
you found me.
Music to my ears.

01:37:12.320 --> 01:37:16.840
I'm perfectly willing to listen
to your demands, whatever they
might be, but not right now.

01:37:16.880 --> 01:37:19.760
No demands, Mr. Adamson.
Oh, no, no, no!

01:37:19.840 --> 01:37:23.520
Hardly that. Julia Rainbird
wants nothing from you...

01:37:23.560 --> 01:37:28.040
but the privilege of making you
heir to the entire
Rainbird fortune.

01:37:28.120 --> 01:37:30.200
The whole, lovely
millions and millions of it.

01:37:30.280 --> 01:37:34.600
<i>Now if she made any demands
at all, they were on me
to find you.</i>

01:37:34.680 --> 01:37:37.520
Through psychic means,
of course.

01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:40.360
Let me get this straight.
Is that the only reason
you and your friend have been,

01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:42.280
shall we say,
investigating me?

01:37:42.320 --> 01:37:44.800
<i>Oh, yes. And don't think
it's been easy.</i>

01:37:44.880 --> 01:37:48.120
<i>Oh, Mr. Adamson,
you've given George and me
the devil's own time of it.</i>

01:37:48.200 --> 01:37:50.600
<i>Tracing you
from a foundling baby...</i>

01:37:50.680 --> 01:37:54.880
<i>to a young boy named Shoebridge
to a man named Adamson.</i>

01:37:54.920 --> 01:37:57.640
<i>Oh, but, Mr. Adamson,
here you are,: Here I am.</i>

01:37:57.680 --> 01:38:01.120
<i>- It's a happy moment
for us all, isn't it?
-</i>

01:38:01.200 --> 01:38:03.560
<i>It's the Bishop.</i>

01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:16.680
Does anyone know
that you've come here?

01:38:18.040 --> 01:38:20.520
No one know...

01:38:20.600 --> 01:38:23.280
Anyone kn-know?

01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:26.800
No. Not a soul.

01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:30.120
Not even George soul.

01:38:30.200 --> 01:38:33.320
You have nothing
to worry about, Mr. Adamson.

01:38:34.920 --> 01:38:36.800
I promise.

01:38:39.400 --> 01:38:42.880
I won't breathe a word...
to anyone.

01:39:01.960 --> 01:39:04.200
It looks like Miss Tyler
needs some rest.

01:39:09.560 --> 01:39:11.760
Will you do as I say?

01:39:28.120 --> 01:39:31.680
No. No.

01:40:12.160 --> 01:40:14.000
Unlock the door.

01:40:21.640 --> 01:40:23.480
Cheer up, Fran.

01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:26.280
Let's go get the new diamond
for our chandelier.

01:40:49.520 --> 01:40:52.960
Wow.
It's gorgeous.

01:41:03.080 --> 01:41:05.440
And now for Madame Blanche.

01:46:13.600 --> 01:46:15.520
Oh, my God.

01:46:58.040 --> 01:46:59.880
Blanche?

01:47:10.880 --> 01:47:12.720
Blanche?

01:47:19.920 --> 01:47:21.800
Blanche?

01:47:50.360 --> 01:47:54.280
<i>If I'm talking too much, perhaps
it's because you're not talking.</i>

01:47:54.360 --> 01:47:57.440
It's my stomach, Arthur.
Murder doesn't agree with it.

01:47:57.520 --> 01:48:00.000
You think I'm
looking forward to it?

01:48:00.040 --> 01:48:03.240
<i>If Joe Maloney
had been more efficient,
they'd both be dead by now.</i>

01:48:04.560 --> 01:48:07.040
You can have my share,
Arthur.

01:48:07.120 --> 01:48:11.320
You can keep both diamonds
all to yourself
if you'll just end it.

01:48:12.400 --> 01:48:15.040
<i>I'll tell you what I'll do.</i>

01:48:15.080 --> 01:48:18.080
<i>If you help me carry Sleeping
Beauty up out of the cellar,
load her into our car...</i>

01:48:18.120 --> 01:48:22.120
<i>and drive her out
to some deserted road
where a suicide can take place,</i>

01:48:22.200 --> 01:48:24.440
<i>I promise you we'll talk
this thing over.</i>

01:48:25.640 --> 01:48:28.480
<i>Okay?
What about the cab driver?</i>

01:48:28.560 --> 01:48:32.680
<i>If she was able to find us,
I'm sure he can too.</i>

01:48:32.760 --> 01:48:37.280
<i>He'll walk
right into our hands.
Your hands, not mine.</i>

01:48:37.320 --> 01:48:39.680
<i>Don't you think we ought to
go down and take a look at her?</i>

01:48:39.720 --> 01:48:41.760
It's been a while
since we gave her that shot.

01:48:41.800 --> 01:48:44.960
<i>You do it.
Okay.</i>

01:49:55.840 --> 01:49:58.480
You'll be happy to know
she's still unconscious.

01:50:20.120 --> 01:50:22.560
Blanche.
Shh!

01:50:47.080 --> 01:50:50.560
I'll put this end
into her exhaust pipe...

01:50:50.640 --> 01:50:53.240
and the other end
in the window.

01:50:53.320 --> 01:50:55.840
That way,
it'll look like suicide.

01:51:29.160 --> 01:51:31.240
Better go and get her now.

01:51:31.320 --> 01:51:34.240
I'll take her in our car.
You follow in hers.

01:51:47.040 --> 01:51:48.880
You take hold
of her feet.

01:51:53.640 --> 01:51:56.440
Jesus, she's heavy.

01:51:58.040 --> 01:51:59.880
George!

01:52:01.400 --> 01:52:03.560
Got 'em.

01:52:06.920 --> 01:52:09.280
Blanche, you faked
that one beautifully.

01:52:09.320 --> 01:52:12.120
You are still the champ.

01:52:12.200 --> 01:52:14.560
Thank you, George.

01:52:14.640 --> 01:52:17.640
Do you realize how much
the reward is for those two?

01:52:19.520 --> 01:52:21.400
Yes.

01:52:21.480 --> 01:52:24.880
But do you realize
how much more
the reward would be...

01:52:24.960 --> 01:52:28.320
if we could
find the diamonds
and turn 'em in?

01:52:33.840 --> 01:52:36.480
What's the matter
with you?

01:52:36.560 --> 01:52:38.560
I...

01:52:38.640 --> 01:52:40.520
Blanche,
what's the matter?

01:52:51.240 --> 01:52:53.160
<i>Blanche,
what's the matter?</i>

01:53:06.600 --> 01:53:08.440
What is it?

01:53:37.720 --> 01:53:40.080
Blanche, you did it!

01:53:40.160 --> 01:53:42.000
You are psychic!

01:53:44.280 --> 01:53:46.920
What am I doing here
on the stairs?
You're not a fake.

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.520
You actually found one.
Look.

01:53:49.600 --> 01:53:51.440
I did?

01:53:51.520 --> 01:53:54.280
I'll get the police on the phone
and give them our good news,

01:53:54.360 --> 01:53:57.400
and call Miss Rainbird
and give her the bad.

01:54:04.400 --> 01:54:06.760
Operator,
can I have the police?

01:54:07.305 --> 01:54:13.159
