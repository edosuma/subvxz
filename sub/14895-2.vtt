[Luke] <i>I grew up, like, 22 miles</i>
<i>down the road here,</i>

01:25.376 --> 01:27.629
so I've always been a Scooba fan.

01:27.712 --> 01:29.130
{\an8}My dad went to school here.

01:29.214 --> 01:31.549
{\an8}He didn't play
any kinda sports or anything.

01:31.633 --> 01:33.927
But, uh, I've always been a Scooba fan.

01:34.010 --> 01:37.263
<i>Uh, I also help, uh, during the games,</i>

01:37.347 --> 01:39.474
<i>home games, uh, on the chain crew.</i>

01:39.557 --> 01:41.059
<i>It's a job that I enjoy.</i>

01:41.142 --> 01:43.853
Uh, I'd rather watch a JUCO game,

01:43.937 --> 01:46.397
than I had a SEC game, or, you know,

01:46.481 --> 01:50.568
because, uh, a lot of these guys I know...
personally.

01:50.652 --> 01:52.487
<i>I go down there and work on their dorms.</i>

01:52.570 --> 01:56.116
<i>They have trouble and I go down there,</i>
<i>and help 'em out, and, uh...</i>

01:56.199 --> 01:57.492
<i>I don't mind.</i>
<i>I give 'em my phone number.</i>

01:57.575 --> 02:01.371
<i>"Hey, if y'all have problems, gentlemen,</i>
<i>I'm right across the road from ya."</i>

02:01.454 --> 02:05.500
And, uh, I get to watch 'em
go up to bigger schools,

02:05.583 --> 02:09.253
and I get to watch 'em
go on up into pro.

02:09.336 --> 02:10.964
And, um...

02:11.047 --> 02:13.925
It's just a great experience in my life.

02:14.008 --> 02:15.426
And, uh...

02:15.510 --> 02:17.762
And I love my job.
I love what I do.

02:17.846 --> 02:19.264

[Wood] <i>If you look at one of the pillars</i>
<i>in our locker room in there,</i>

02:53.965 --> 02:55.091
<i>it talks about the horse.</i>

02:55.174 --> 02:58.011
<i>And it describes how</i>
<i>God describes the horse.</i>

02:58.094 --> 03:00.388
{\an8}<i>And here's what it says</i>
<i>when he describes the horse.</i>

03:00.471 --> 03:02.056
{\an8}<i>This is him talking to Job.</i>
<i>He says,</i>

03:02.140 --> 03:06.019
"Do you give the horse his strength
or clothe his neck with a flowing mane?

03:06.102 --> 03:09.272
Do you make him leap like a locust,
striking terror with his proud snorting?

03:09.355 --> 03:11.524
He paws fiercely,
rejoicing in his strength,

03:11.608 --> 03:12.984
and charges into the fray.

03:13.067 --> 03:15.737
He laughs at fear,
afraid of nothing.

03:15.820 --> 03:17.906
In frenzied excitement,
he eats up the ground.

03:17.989 --> 03:20.575
He cannot stand still
when the trumpet sounds."

03:20.658 --> 03:22.535
That's how the horse is built.

03:22.619 --> 03:24.454
Now, if God'll make
the horse to do that...

03:24.537 --> 03:26.080
the horse conquers things.

03:26.164 --> 03:27.457
What about you?

03:27.540 --> 03:29.292
What can you conquer?
What can you do?

03:29.375 --> 03:30.543
All right.

03:30.627 --> 03:32.337
That's it, kinda,
on the lesson with that.

03:32.420 --> 03:36.341
Wanna tie it back into, uh,
us from a football standpoint.

03:36.424 --> 03:38.968
This came out today...
in <i>The Clarion-Ledger.</i>

03:40.136 --> 03:42.805
"Co-Lin draws early nod
as the MACJC favorite.

03:42.889 --> 03:45.266
Despite back-to-back title runs
for East Mississippi,

03:45.350 --> 03:47.602
Co-Lin has drawn a lot
of pre-season praise.

03:47.685 --> 03:50.104
While it does seem odd for
East Mississippi not to be the favorite,

03:50.188 --> 03:54.108

the Wolfpack is loaded."

[Wood] Doesn't matter that you beat them
twice last year, they don't care.

04:00.198 --> 04:02.700
The last loss we had
was to Co-Lin in 2012.

04:02.784 --> 04:05.745
And the last two losses they've had
came by us last year.

04:06.663 --> 04:09.290
Now, get your head on what's important.
Make sure you're paying attention.

04:09.374 --> 04:12.001
Make sure, off the field, that you're
working on being a better person.

04:12.085 --> 04:13.461
We talk about that all the time, too.

04:13.544 --> 04:15.088
Make sure you're the guy
that's built to last.

04:15.171 --> 04:16.214

04:16.297 --> 04:19.050

{\an8}He always was able to throw the ball...
30, 40 yards at 12 years old.

06:16.667 --> 06:18.252
<i>So it was when he got to high school</i>

06:18.336 --> 06:20.922

{\an8}We called him Showtime when he was here.

06:24.675 --> 06:26.219

06:28.429 --> 06:31.724

<i>"You know what,</i>

07:46.466 --> 07:49.177

<i>Their focus, their whole life,</i>
<i>has been on,</i>

10:00.224 --> 10:01.475
<i>"You're gonna be good at football."</i>

10:01.559 --> 10:02.935
Okay, let's go over
<i>The Most Dangerous Game</i>

10:03.019 --> 10:04.854
really, really quick.
Who wrote it?

10:06.188 --> 10:07.940
-[boys laughing]
-[Ollie] It's over with.

10:08.024 --> 10:09.400
[Marcel] Yeah.
We gotta leave for class.

10:09.483 --> 10:11.360
Do y'all know the two main characters?

10:11.444 --> 10:14.572
[Ollie and Marcel] Yeah, uh,
Rainsford and the general.

10:14.655 --> 10:16.240
-[Wagner] General Zaroff.
-[boys] Yeah.

10:16.324 --> 10:18.868
And when Zaroff tells them
that he hunts humans,

10:18.951 --> 10:21.704
he acts like that's
the craziest thing ever.

10:21.787 --> 10:22.997
He's a murderer.

10:23.080 --> 10:26.626
But then, the irony in that
is that Zaroff turns to Rainsford,

10:26.709 --> 10:29.045
he says,
"Okay, well, do it one time with me.

10:29.128 --> 10:30.504
Let's do it one time with me."

10:30.588 --> 10:32.590
-[Ollie mutters]
-So they go out, and they have this game

10:32.673 --> 10:36.761
where they hunt each other, and Rainsford
ends up getting, like, an adrenaline rush

10:36.844 --> 10:38.012
-and liking it.
-Yeah.

10:38.095 --> 10:40.640
So they end up doing it.
Rainsford ends up killing...

10:40.723 --> 10:41.766
Zaroff.

10:41.849 --> 10:44.977
-...the bodyguard. What's his name?
-The big dude... Uh...

10:45.061 --> 10:48.189
[Ollie stammers] The big... the big dude
who had the gun pointed to him and--

10:48.272 --> 10:49.940
[Wagner] Yep. He ends up killing his--

10:50.024 --> 10:51.192
Zeus. Zeus.

10:51.275 --> 10:52.735
-[Wagner] No.
-It's some Zoo, Zip...

10:52.818 --> 10:54.070
[Marcus] Zing, or something.

10:54.153 --> 10:57.281
[Wagner] Ask her when you walk in,
what the bodyguard's name is.

10:57.365 --> 10:58.699
He kills all the dogs.

10:58.783 --> 11:01.160
Rainsford ends up winning the hunt.

11:01.243 --> 11:04.455
And then ends up getting addicted to,
basically, murdering people.

11:04.538 --> 11:06.916
-Oh, that's... that's tight.
-[boy] So, he does the same thing?

11:06.999 --> 11:08.501
Dang, we should've finished it.

11:08.584 --> 11:10.294
[indistinct chatter]

11:12.588 --> 11:14.131
Do you have a pencil?

11:18.344 --> 11:19.887
Maybe.

11:19.970 --> 11:21.055
Maybe not.

11:25.101 --> 11:28.896
[John whispering] Oh, why'd I do that?
[CJ] Oh, my gosh. Pick the ball up. What?

11:28.979 --> 11:31.023
Oh, my...
That spin never works.

11:31.107 --> 11:32.983
-I'm about to get hot, for real.
-[chuckles]

11:33.067 --> 11:34.819
[John] This is how we entertain ourselves.

11:34.902 --> 11:37.405
'Cause there ain't nothing to do
in Scooba, at all.

11:37.488 --> 11:40.783
{\an8}-So...
-All we have is Subway and a...

11:40.866 --> 11:42.785
{\an8}a chicken place.

11:42.868 --> 11:44.703
[John] I went to the number one
party school in the country.

11:44.787 --> 11:46.747
So it was a lot of fun for me.

11:46.831 --> 11:48.040
This is the party right now.

11:48.124 --> 11:49.667
Yeah, homie.
Yeah... yeah, we're the party.

11:49.750 --> 11:52.336
[CJ] It isn't that much to do,
but it is football heaven.

11:52.420 --> 11:53.462
That's why we came here,
you know.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.423
He just got his first offer yesterday.

11:55.506 --> 11:57.925
Yeah, I just got an offer yesterday
by West Virginia, you know.

11:58.008 --> 11:59.927
The dream offer is LSU, though.

12:00.010 --> 12:01.011
That is my dream.

12:01.095 --> 12:03.639
I've been talking to Auburn a lot.
Talked to them this morning.

12:04.390 --> 12:06.267
They say this is supposed to be
the biggest game.

12:06.350 --> 12:07.977
-Co-Lin.
-Yeah.

12:08.060 --> 12:10.563
They're, like, one of the best
JUCOs, too, in Mississippi. Yeah.

12:10.646 --> 12:13.941
-Quote, unquote.
-Quote, unquote. So, we'll see.

12:14.024 --> 12:15.860
[interviewer] You guys nervous?

12:15.943 --> 12:17.069
-Never nervous.
-Never.

12:17.153 --> 12:18.446
[both laughing]

12:18.529 --> 12:19.655
[Wyatt] Ready, set.

12:20.573 --> 12:21.615
[grunts]

12:22.700 --> 12:24.785
[indistinct chatter]

12:28.414 --> 12:30.332
{\an8}[Wyatt] <i>If I get a good offer,</i>
<i>I'm not-- I can't pass up</i>

12:30.416 --> 12:31.667
then obviously I'm gonna take it.

12:31.750 --> 12:34.712
And then if not, I'm just gonna go
to Mississippi State, and, uh...

12:34.795 --> 12:37.423
play some intramural ball or somethin',

12:37.506 --> 12:39.925
and finish out my education
and get to work, you know.

12:40.009 --> 12:42.386
'Cause you gotta face reality sometime.

12:42.470 --> 12:45.264
You know, you can't just
play football the rest of your life.

12:45.347 --> 12:47.516
I mean, some people can, but...

12:47.600 --> 12:49.602
and that's a great thing to do, but,

12:49.685 --> 12:51.979
you know, most of us got to go to work.

12:52.104 --> 12:54.356
So you gotta start thinking
about that sometime.

12:56.150 --> 12:58.027
[Buddy] Oh, we got it!
We got it! We got it!

12:58.110 --> 12:59.236
[player] Ready, set, hut!

12:59.320 --> 13:00.613
[Buddy] Good...
Oh, shit.

13:00.696 --> 13:02.239
[whistle blowing]

13:03.199 --> 13:04.366
[DJ] I'm tryin' to go to Florida.

13:04.450 --> 13:06.285
They said they liked it,
they like me, so...

13:06.368 --> 13:07.578
we'll see how that works out.

13:07.661 --> 13:09.330
-They give you an offer yet?
-Uh-uh.

13:10.581 --> 13:11.665
Not yet.

13:11.749 --> 13:13.000
Where you got one to?

13:13.083 --> 13:16.212
I got Louisville, Ole Miss, West Virginia.

13:16.295 --> 13:17.880
We gotta write that paper.

13:17.963 --> 13:20.341
Um... UAB.
Who else?

13:20.424 --> 13:22.051
And that's it for right now.

13:23.093 --> 13:26.847
Ole Miss, West Virginia,
Louisville, UAB, and that's it.

13:27.848 --> 13:28.974
Four.

13:30.017 --> 13:31.644
-What paper?
-For...

13:31.727 --> 13:32.853
-Miss Rose?
-Yeah.

13:32.937 --> 13:34.063
We got a paper?

13:35.231 --> 13:36.774
[man] How much do you know
about DJ Law?

13:36.857 --> 13:37.900
[Wagner laughs]

13:37.983 --> 13:40.736
{\an8}-Well, I better know a lot about him, huh?
-Yes, ma'am.

13:40.819 --> 13:44.156
{\an8}He's the most highly recruited player
in the country, I think.

13:44.240 --> 13:45.282
Um...

13:45.366 --> 13:47.451
He's gonna be a guy that's gonna
come down to the last grade

13:47.535 --> 13:49.161
being put in the computer
as to whether--

13:49.245 --> 13:51.539
What's he like, personality-wise?
What's he like?

13:51.622 --> 13:55.709
He's got a great personality.
He is always happy, always smiling.

13:55.793 --> 13:57.211
Um, he's been through a lot.

13:57.294 --> 14:00.005
-He's got a troubled past and childhood.
-Right.

14:00.089 --> 14:02.341
-He has never been disrespectful to me.
-Got you.

14:02.424 --> 14:05.177
You know, "Yes, ma'am,
yes, ma'am, yes, ma'am."

14:05.261 --> 14:09.807
Flipside of that, um, he may
or may not do what I tell him to do.

14:09.890 --> 14:12.560
-He may or may not respond to a text.
-Right.

14:12.643 --> 14:14.478
He may or may not go to class.

14:14.562 --> 14:16.939
He's one of those guys, too,
that was so good.

14:17.022 --> 14:18.607
I mean, I don't know that
he's ever really...

14:18.691 --> 14:21.360
You know, in high school I think he was
just kind of allowed to do whatever.

14:21.443 --> 14:25.322
I mean, he's a guy that--
He's just a product of...

14:25.406 --> 14:27.700
-the environment that he's been in.
-His talent has, uh,

14:27.783 --> 14:30.327
made him have to... allowed him
to be absent of his responsibility.

14:30.411 --> 14:31.412
Yeah.

14:31.495 --> 14:33.372
But, when he gets there,
do you feel like he can do the work?

14:33.455 --> 14:34.707
I feel like he can do it.
Yeah.

14:34.790 --> 14:36.166
-Now, he needs-- He'll need help.
-Right.

14:36.250 --> 14:37.668
I mean, he needs help,
he needs encourage--

14:37.751 --> 14:40.796
He's not a guy
that really responds to negativity.

14:40.880 --> 14:43.632
When you see him, you let him know
Southeastern is waiting on him.

14:43.716 --> 14:44.967
All right.
I will.

14:48.637 --> 14:50.806
[Wagner] <i>Grade reports are due Friday.</i>

14:50.890 --> 14:54.518
<i>This is, like, the first indicator</i>
<i>of how everybody is doing.</i>

14:54.602 --> 14:57.438
<i>I may panic myself,</i>

14:57.521 --> 14:59.523
<i>but I don't want the athletes to panic.</i>

14:59.607 --> 15:03.611
If they see me panicking this early,
and then they panic,

15:03.694 --> 15:05.362
nine times out of ten...

15:06.822 --> 15:08.115
they're gonna just quit.

15:08.198 --> 15:11.535
<i>I have a feeling</i>
<i>I'm gonna be panicking about DJ Law.</i>

15:11.619 --> 15:14.246
<i>He's got some absences.</i>
<i>That makes me panic.</i>

15:14.330 --> 15:18.125
<i>If he gets dropped from classes,</i>
<i>then he won't... he can't play.</i>

15:18.208 --> 15:21.253
And we need him.
I mean, he's a key player.

15:21.337 --> 15:23.881
So if he gets dropped...
He cannot get dropped.

15:23.964 --> 15:26.175
<i>And for DJ, like, he can't do that.</i>

15:26.258 --> 15:28.928
<i>The National Championship</i>
<i>really is right there.</i>

15:29.011 --> 15:32.097
<i>That's prime recruiting</i>
<i>for Division I football.</i>

15:32.181 --> 15:34.350
<i>If they're gonna have any chance</i>
<i>of making it when they leave here,</i>

15:34.433 --> 15:36.435
<i>they just need to learn the lesson that,</i>

15:36.518 --> 15:38.187
<i>you know, just do</i>
<i>what you're supposed to do.</i>

15:45.819 --> 15:49.198
I never, ever saw myself
in a place like Scooba, honestly.

15:49.281 --> 15:53.118
My, kind of, mantra has always been,
"Put me where I'm most effective."

15:53.202 --> 15:56.038
Like, put me at the place
where I can impact people the most.

15:56.121 --> 15:58.248
And I think, right now, this is it for me.

15:58.332 --> 16:00.834
I'm impacting more
college football players

16:00.918 --> 16:02.378
at East Mississippi Community College

16:02.461 --> 16:06.590
than I ever, in a million years,
could dream I could do.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.927
<i>With my personal life, am I happy?</i>

16:10.010 --> 16:11.178
[groans]

16:11.261 --> 16:15.474
<i>You know, it probably hasn't gone</i>
<i>the way that I wanted it to go.</i>

16:16.850 --> 16:21.397
And I mean, I really don't have
a whole lot of a personal life.

16:22.064 --> 16:24.817
<i>And then you have</i>
<i>the whole aspect of having a child.</i>

16:24.900 --> 16:28.195
<i>I think it's very important for children</i>
<i>to be on a schedule</i>

16:28.278 --> 16:30.447
<i>and feel like life is stable.</i>

16:30.531 --> 16:34.410
<i>Especially in her situation, where</i>
<i>her parents, you know, got a divorce,</i>

16:34.493 --> 16:35.953
<i>and then her dad moved away.</i>

16:36.036 --> 16:38.163
<i>You know, I mean,</i>
<i>I think I'm a very successful single mom,</i>

16:38.247 --> 16:42.001
<i>and hopefully...</i>
<i>it won't be like this forever.</i>

16:42.084 --> 16:43.127
[chuckles]

16:43.794 --> 16:45.963
-[Wagner] Love you.
-Love you, too.

16:46.046 --> 16:47.756
Sleep good.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.133
Okay.

16:49.216 --> 16:50.259
[kissing]

16:50.342 --> 16:51.468
I'm gonna turn the air down.

16:51.552 --> 16:54.179
It's hot in here right now,
but I'm gonna turn the air down, okay?

16:54.263 --> 16:56.807
-Okay.
-All right. Night-night.

getting named starter, baby.

<i>I did, yeah. Appreciate it.</i>
<i>Appreciate it.</i>

17:49.902 --> 17:51.779
<i>I just gotta go out there and do my thing.</i>
<i>That's it.</i>

17:51.862 --> 17:55.824
Hey, I know that, uh, I know that
there's been a lot of people calling,

17:55.908 --> 17:58.327
a lot of people text you and everything.

17:58.410 --> 18:02.748
Just wanted to call and tell you
how proud we are for you, okay?

18:02.831 --> 18:04.625
<i>All right, I appreciate it.</i>
<i>Hey, I watched the game.</i>

18:04.708 --> 18:06.168
<i>Y'all looked pretty good, man.</i>

18:06.251 --> 18:07.961
I thought the quarterbacks
looked good, huh?

18:08.045 --> 18:11.381
We're gonna kind of
switch it around a little bit this week

18:11.465 --> 18:14.176
and let, uh, John Franklin go first,

18:14.259 --> 18:16.261
and let Wyatt go second.

18:16.345 --> 18:20.682
Really still trying to find out who
"the guy" is. You know what I'm saying?

18:20.766 --> 18:22.434
<i>Yeah, y'all have Co-Lin this week?</i>

18:22.518 --> 18:24.770
Yeah, we got Co-Lin
at their place this week.

18:24.853 --> 18:26.438
<i>All right.</i>
<i>Well, go do that work.</i>

18:26.522 --> 18:29.191
-See you, man. All right, bye.
<i>-All right. All right, Coach. Bye.</i>

18:33.654 --> 18:34.822
That's good.

18:35.906 --> 18:39.785
He learned he was
the starting quarterback at Ole Miss.

18:39.868 --> 18:42.329
[stutters] He's made a few bad decisions,

18:42.412 --> 18:45.749
you know, but he makes me very proud.

18:45.833 --> 18:46.917
Very, very proud.

18:47.000 --> 18:51.880
Proud for him, proud for where he's come,
you know, and how far he's gone.

18:51.964 --> 18:53.257
Very, very proud.

18:56.468 --> 19:00.514
[Chad] <i>The guy that first introduced me</i>

19:06.019 --> 19:10.315
And the day that all the stuff
kinda hit ESPN,

19:10.399 --> 19:12.442

There's reasons why you're there,

19:38.218 --> 19:41.054
And things worked out perfectly.
[chuckles]

19:41.138 --> 19:43.473
[indistinct shouting]

19:43.557 --> 19:44.600
<i>No matter what level it is,</i>

19:44.683 --> 19:48.979
<i>to go out there and actually do it</i>
<i>and win it is the greatest feeling ever.</i>

19:50.647 --> 19:55.360
[Buddy] <i>This place was really a place</i>
<i>to revamp his public image.</i>

19:55.444 --> 19:59.406
<i>'Cause sometimes when they come here,</i>
<i>they're working on their last chance,</i>

19:59.489 --> 20:02.159
<i>and this is a chance</i>
<i>for them to step forward</i>

20:02.242 --> 20:03.744
<i>and make people believe in 'em again.</i>

20:03.827 --> 20:04.995
[crowd cheering]

20:05.078 --> 20:06.580
{\an8}It's obviously worked, you know.

20:06.663 --> 20:09.166
{\an8}I mean, I don't pretend to know
exactly how he does it.

20:11.752 --> 20:14.880
<i>The great high school quarterback</i>
<i>who didn't qualify,</i>

20:14.963 --> 20:17.925
<i>and came here,</i>
<i>and went on to Ole Miss.</i>

20:21.595 --> 20:25.515
<i>And then you get another kid,</i>
<i>leaves Arkansas State to come here</i>

20:25.599 --> 20:27.351
<i>because he wants to go somewhere bigger,</i>

20:27.434 --> 20:30.604
<i>and then he becomes</i>
<i>the starting quarterback at Ole Miss.</i>

20:31.647 --> 20:33.732
[crowd cheering]

20:33.815 --> 20:37.027
[Jubera] <i>And they have</i>
<i>their best season in forever.</i>

20:37.110 --> 20:38.737
[announcer] <i>They're rushing the field.</i>

20:38.820 --> 20:40.781
<i>Bo Wallace wants to keep that football.</i>

20:40.864 --> 20:43.033
[Jubera] <i>They want a place</i>
<i>that's gonna send them on.</i>

20:43.116 --> 20:45.827
<i>And that's what this place</i>
<i>is kind of proven to be.</i>

20:46.536 --> 20:49.081
{\an8}[Buddy] <i>We've had a legacy.</i>
<i>Seven straight all-American quarterbacks.</i>

20:49.164 --> 20:50.499
It's what we do, you know.

20:50.582 --> 20:54.336
And I think the one we've got coming up
may be better than all of them.

20:55.420 --> 20:57.714
[John] <i>I learned a lot</i>
<i>while I was in Tallahassee,</i>

20:57.798 --> 21:01.260
{\an8}but I came here and, you know,
I'm getting a chance to play.

21:01.343 --> 21:03.345
{\an8}And, uh, I'm finding my love for it again.

21:03.428 --> 21:06.431
<i>Everybody looking forward to me</i>
<i>to blow it up like I normally do.</i>

21:06.515 --> 21:08.267
[exhales] <i>Especially Coach Stephens.</i>

21:08.350 --> 21:12.062
He done said it about ten times this week,
from Sunday already, so... [chuckles]

21:14.398 --> 21:15.607
[Buddy] I need you to be better.

21:15.691 --> 21:18.193
I need you to be better
at everything you do.

21:18.277 --> 21:19.611
Period. Okay?

21:19.695 --> 21:22.114
This bunch, this week will
come after your ass on this now.

21:22.197 --> 21:23.198
Okay?

21:23.282 --> 21:25.784
They will put...
they will put eight guys down here

21:25.867 --> 21:27.494
-that will come after your ass.
-[John] <i>Ready, set.</i>

21:28.662 --> 21:31.039
-[Trickett] Ball!
-[man] I like it. I like that.

21:31.123 --> 21:32.666
-[whistle blows]
-[indistinct chatter]

21:32.749 --> 21:34.793
[DJ] Good ball.
Good ball, John.

21:34.876 --> 21:36.920
I'm diming today.
I dime every day.

21:39.131 --> 21:40.674
Thinkin' about a little black-white-black.

21:44.636 --> 21:47.681
Little skull and bones,
little black pants, little white shirt.

21:47.764 --> 21:48.765
Which white jersey?

21:48.849 --> 21:50.642
I like the chrome one.

21:50.726 --> 21:52.769
-All in white? Okay.
-Which-- I like that one.

21:52.853 --> 21:54.771
And if we do that,
we gotta go white undershirt.

21:54.855 --> 21:55.981
Yeah, okay.

21:56.064 --> 21:57.816
-What do you think?
-It'll look good.

21:57.899 --> 22:00.193
Or you could go black.
You could go white, white.

22:00.277 --> 22:01.820
Solid white with a black helmet.

22:01.903 --> 22:03.488
[Wood] <i>Copiah-Lincoln's our next opponent.</i>

22:03.572 --> 22:06.158
Uh, Co-Lin's a very good football team.

22:06.241 --> 22:07.617
Uh, we're ranked number one
in one of the polls.

22:07.701 --> 22:10.037
And then, another one of the polls
has them ranked number one.

22:10.120 --> 22:11.163
So, uh...

22:11.246 --> 22:13.582
<i>I don't wanna say it's bad blood</i>
<i>between anybody necessarily,</i>

22:13.665 --> 22:15.292
<i>but our last loss was to Co-Lin.</i>

22:15.375 --> 22:18.337
[announcer] <i>...at the one-yard line,</i>
<i>and EMCC's season is over.</i>

22:18.420 --> 22:21.214
So, yeah. To say it's a...
to say it's a big deal to us?

22:21.298 --> 22:22.674
That'd be an understatement.

22:23.717 --> 22:24.968
-[indistinct chatter]
-[Buddy] Hurry up!

22:25.052 --> 22:27.387

Blow the whistle.

-[CJ] Right, right, right.
-[whistle blows]

22:55.332 --> 22:58.293

Hey, how you...

23:01.254 --> 23:02.589
[whispering] Hey, friend.

23:06.510 --> 23:07.803
What's up, friend?

23:09.262 --> 23:12.182
She got me.
I ain't talkin' about that.

23:14.434 --> 23:15.519
[John] What up, friend?

23:15.602 --> 23:16.603
[woman whispering]

23:16.686 --> 23:18.105
[John] I don't wanna talk
about that right now.

23:18.188 --> 23:19.231
I'm just trying to say what's up.

23:19.314 --> 23:21.024
You in the crew now,
so you know what I'm saying?

23:21.108 --> 23:22.692

You know, you're my friend now,
so I'm gonna say what's up.

23:25.946 --> 23:27.114

Practice tomorrow at 3:15.

23:33.787 --> 23:36.206
What's your goal... this year?

23:36.289 --> 23:37.666

-I mean, I just--
-Oh, that's so sad.

where I'm gonna go after this.

23:43.380 --> 23:45.048
Ah, so you just came. Okay.

23:45.132 --> 23:47.425
Are you planning on going back?

23:47.509 --> 23:48.593
No.

23:48.677 --> 23:50.011
You got a girlfriend?

23:50.095 --> 23:51.263
[John] Wait.
What'd you say?

23:51.346 --> 23:52.848
Do you got a girlfriend?

23:52.931 --> 23:54.474
No. I ain't got no girlfriend.

Grayson, he was trying to smuggle a...

25:09.090 --> 25:12.052
[stammers] He was trying
to smuggle a girl out of his room.

25:12.135 --> 25:13.803
[players laughing]

25:15.555 --> 25:17.933
J-5 was not even trying to smuggle,

25:18.016 --> 25:20.685
[stammering] he was clearly
running for the border.

25:21.394 --> 25:22.479
All right.

25:22.562 --> 25:24.231
So, hey, let me say this.

25:24.314 --> 25:26.650
I say that laughingly,
and it's jokingly, and all that,

25:26.733 --> 25:28.318
but here's your warning, okay?

25:28.401 --> 25:30.362
We-- We say all that
to give you a warning.

25:30.445 --> 25:33.156
I'm not mad at them,
but I'm telling you right now,

25:33.240 --> 25:35.575
if you get caught,
you're gonna get a $300 fine.

25:35.659 --> 25:37.953
And ain't nothing Coach Stephens
gonna be able to do to you.

25:38.036 --> 25:40.830
Hey, I'm telling ya now...
Hey, I mean it.

25:40.914 --> 25:42.582
If you get caught...

25:42.666 --> 25:44.084
if you get caught...

25:44.167 --> 25:45.669
by... listen to me.

25:45.752 --> 25:47.796
If you get caught by campus police,

25:47.879 --> 25:50.006
they're gonna give you a $300 ticket.

25:50.090 --> 25:51.258
$300.

25:51.341 --> 25:53.760
You can go up here to the
Western Motel, and get $45,

25:53.843 --> 25:55.011
pay $45.

25:55.095 --> 25:56.721
Three of you can split it, $45,

25:56.805 --> 25:59.307
and each of you get, like,
eight hours a piece

25:59.391 --> 26:00.642
-in the motel room.
-[all laughing]

26:00.725 --> 26:01.851
All right?

26:01.935 --> 26:05.397
So... and it don't cost you but $15.

26:05.480 --> 26:06.690
All right? So...

26:06.773 --> 26:09.567
it's a lot easier than paying a $300 fine,

26:09.651 --> 26:12.862
that's gonna go on there, and you're gonna
have to pay it before you get your grades.

26:12.946 --> 26:15.323
[Wagner] It's just a female
with a body part...

26:15.407 --> 26:16.700
-[John] No. No.
-...to you.

26:16.783 --> 26:17.826
You don't think.

That's as far as your thoughts go.
"Oh, here's a female."

26:21.454 --> 26:23.164
What more is there
to think about right now?

26:23.248 --> 26:24.916
It's a human being.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.418
-A person.
-Okay.

26:26.501 --> 26:31.172
Like, a person with a brain and a heart,
and feelings, and emotions, and...

26:31.256 --> 26:32.674
Well, all that was already established--

26:32.757 --> 26:34.301
-All that was already...
-That's all one side of it.

26:34.384 --> 26:38.388
On the other side of it,
there's diseases and consequences,

26:38.471 --> 26:41.016
and all kinds of other stuff.

26:41.099 --> 26:44.477
Reputation, and just... whatever.

26:45.395 --> 26:47.397
There's a lot to think about.

26:47.480 --> 26:49.232
[sighs] I'm disappointed in you.

26:53.028 --> 26:55.238
-I'm sorry that I'm--
-You got her number on Tuesday,

26:55.322 --> 26:56.656
she came to your game on Thursday,

26:56.740 --> 26:59.034
and she gets caught
in your room on... Friday.

26:59.117 --> 27:00.535
Like, come on.

27:01.661 --> 27:02.912
-I mean...
-And now you're done with her.

27:02.996 --> 27:04.247
-I'm a college student--
-Terrible decision.

27:04.331 --> 27:07.584
-I'm a male football college athlete.
-Don't matter. That's a terrible decision.

27:07.667 --> 27:11.421
I'm so sorry that I'm
just living the life right now.

27:11.504 --> 27:12.756
Did you go to college once?

27:13.923 --> 27:15.633
-Did I do what?
-Did you go to college once?

27:15.717 --> 27:16.885
I did go to college.

27:16.968 --> 27:18.720
Then why you, like, so disappointed?
I don't get it.

27:18.803 --> 27:20.347
You know how this...
you know how this shit go.

27:20.430 --> 27:22.182
Mmm... Mmm-mmm.
Actually, I don't.

27:22.265 --> 27:23.308
[John] Hmm.

27:24.184 --> 27:27.228
You've been around college athletes
for how long now? Seventeen years?

27:27.312 --> 27:30.273
Mmm-hmm. I been tryin' to make y'all
make better decisions for 17 years.

27:30.357 --> 27:33.068
It's not gonna happen.
It's the evolution of life.

27:33.151 --> 27:34.778
-It's... it's not really.
-It's a stage.

27:34.861 --> 27:35.904
It is.

27:35.987 --> 27:38.114
I mean, I get what you're saying, but...

27:38.198 --> 27:41.117
All right. So let me go through my stage.
Let me live my stage.

27:41.201 --> 27:42.952
I'm thinking about it
from a female perspective.

27:43.036 --> 27:46.539
-I've been in Florida State for two years.
-I know how these girls operate.

27:46.623 --> 27:49.125
Well, you still haven't told me
what way it's disappointing.

27:54.631 --> 27:56.966
-That you would treat a woman like that.
-So I have nothing to agree--

27:57.050 --> 27:58.885
-Like, I don't...
-What did I treat her like?

27:58.968 --> 28:00.428
I didn't dog the girl.

28:00.512 --> 28:02.972
I didn't put the girl's business out here.

28:03.056 --> 28:04.474
What did I treat her like?

28:04.557 --> 28:05.975
That's what I'm still confused on.

28:07.894 --> 28:10.772
