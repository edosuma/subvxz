Adam kane to see the general.

00:15.615 --> 00:18.418
Excuse me, the general can't
see you without an appointment.

00:18.453 --> 00:20.020
All he has to do is
look up and i'll be there.

00:20.055 --> 00:21.621
Excuse me.

00:22.022 --> 00:26.426
I'm afraid that
that just won't work.

00:30.430 --> 00:32.432
You just don't know how to
take no for an answer, do you?

00:32.467 --> 00:37.637
It's okay, jen,
go back to your desk.

00:40.840 --> 00:43.643
When i created the
phased vibrational generator,

00:43.678 --> 00:46.011
the company's mandate was clear

00:46.046 --> 00:48.848
it was not to be sold
for military application.

00:48.883 --> 00:52.052
How did you find out?

00:52.452 --> 00:55.255
Buying the device through a
dummy mining corporation fooled

00:55.655 --> 00:57.657
the people at the company
- it didn't fool me.

00:57.692 --> 00:59.659
My intelligence network
is better than yours.

01:00.060 --> 01:04.063
You cannot test this kind
of thing on innocent people.

01:04.464 --> 01:07.667
The kovakhstani rebels
are hardly innocent.

01:07.702 --> 01:08.868
They've killed...

01:09.269 --> 01:11.871
you have no right to slaughter
these people using my device.

01:11.906 --> 01:14.474
The office of defense testing
decided that this was a...

01:14.874 --> 01:16.476
you're the office
of defense testing.

01:16.876 --> 01:18.443
This is your decision.

01:18.478 --> 01:21.681
Anything that happens in
that country, it's on your head.

01:21.716 --> 01:25.250
All right.

01:25.285 --> 01:30.455
I'm sure you'd have
found this out anyway.

01:30.490 --> 01:34.459
I just received this
message a few minutes ago.

01:34.494 --> 01:36.896
It's a recording from
the pilot who was transporting

01:36.931 --> 01:39.699
the device to our
allies in kovakhstan.

01:40.900 --> 01:42.467
Lock it in for final approach.

01:42.502 --> 01:44.704
Roger that. You're
cleared for landing.

01:44.739 --> 01:46.906
Base, i have hostile
fire at eight o'clock.

01:46.941 --> 01:48.108
Looked like stingers.

01:48.508 --> 01:49.709
You got another
one on your tail.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.276
Take evasive action.

01:51.311 --> 01:52.912
Well, i don't know how
much longer i'm going to be...

01:52.947 --> 01:54.079
i'm losing power.

01:54.114 --> 01:57.717
Going down! Going down!

01:59.319 --> 02:00.920
Okay, so that's just great.

02:01.321 --> 02:03.323
You have managed to deliver
one of the most powerful weapons

02:03.723 --> 02:07.727
on earth right into
the middle of the bloodiest
war on the planet.

02:07.762 --> 02:09.729
This is not our fault.

02:09.764 --> 02:10.895
No?

02:10.930 --> 02:13.333
But i know who
has to clean it up.

02:20.540 --> 02:22.142
I am adam kane.

02:22.542 --> 02:25.345
I was a pioneer
of genetic research,

02:25.380 --> 02:28.148
manipulating dna
to save human lives.

02:28.548 --> 02:33.353
But in many, their
genes unexpectedly mutated.

02:34.554 --> 02:37.757
They developed
superhuman abilities.

03:03.383 --> 03:05.350
Together with four
of the most powerful,

03:05.385 --> 03:08.588
i fight to protect a world
that doesn't even know we exist.

03:12.192 --> 03:15.395
We are mutant x.

03:19.232 --> 03:22.000
My name is captain
daniel morrison.

03:22.035 --> 03:25.038
I'm in the custody of the
liberation army of kovakhstan.

03:25.073 --> 03:28.006
The only condition for
my safe return is complete and

03:28.041 --> 03:32.045
immediate end to all outside
intervention in their country.

03:32.080 --> 03:34.812
I request no attempts
be made to rescue me,

03:34.847 --> 03:40.053
as it will only result
in my immediate execution.

03:42.855 --> 03:46.024
It was a covert operation.

03:46.059 --> 03:49.662
He was delivering a piece
of technology the government

03:49.697 --> 03:51.264
fraudulently obtained
from one of the companies

03:51.299 --> 03:52.830
that i'm connected with.

03:52.865 --> 03:54.832
Like any great invention,
our friends in the military are

03:54.867 --> 03:57.270
trying to figure
out how to use it to kill
people more efficiently.

03:57.670 --> 04:02.075
So, we're supposed
to waltz into kovakhstan
to help this government...

04:02.475 --> 04:03.676
dictatorship.

04:04.077 --> 04:06.479
They haven't had an
election in fifteen years.

04:06.514 --> 04:09.682
Help this dictatorship
to get it back.

04:09.717 --> 04:10.883
Well, nobody's getting it back.

04:11.284 --> 04:12.885
It's too dangerous
for either side to have.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.452
Excuse me, okay?

04:14.487 --> 04:16.488
Has anybody thought about
the pilot's being held hostage?

04:16.524 --> 04:20.093
They're pursuing a
diplomatic course of action

04:20.128 --> 04:22.095
to try to effect his release.

04:22.495 --> 04:23.661
For what?

04:23.696 --> 04:25.698
A mission they can't even admit
they were on in the first place?

04:25.733 --> 04:26.899
They're going
to let him rot, adam.

04:27.300 --> 04:28.901
He's going to be another
pilot that never came back.

04:28.936 --> 04:30.503
Nobody's forgetting
about the pilot, brennan.

04:30.903 --> 04:32.905
But if either side in this
war gets their hands on this

04:32.940 --> 04:34.907
weapon, tens of thousands
of people are going to die.

04:38.111 --> 04:40.913
Okay, so when do we leave?

05:08.141 --> 05:12.145
Well, we have an eta
of one hour and counting.

05:31.364 --> 05:33.766
Oh...

05:44.577 --> 05:48.581
brennan, back
at sanctuary, when you were
talking about the pilot...

05:48.616 --> 05:54.187
i'm not reading you, not
any more than a friend would.

05:54.222 --> 05:58.991
What was that all about?

05:59.026 --> 06:00.193
Nothing.

06:00.593 --> 06:02.595
I was making sure
all the bases were covered.

06:02.630 --> 06:04.997
Friends know
when you're lying, too.

06:11.804 --> 06:15.408
You ever hear
me talk about my father?

06:15.443 --> 06:18.576
Just your step-father.

06:18.611 --> 06:21.414
He didn't exactly
sound like a picnic.

06:21.449 --> 06:25.235
I never met my real dad.

06:25.270 --> 06:28.986
He was a navy pilot.

06:29.021 --> 06:31.824
Shot down in the vietnam war.

06:31.859 --> 06:34.627
So what happened to him?

06:44.637 --> 06:48.241
He went down behind enemy lines.

06:48.641 --> 06:52.610
Eventually caught and killed.

06:52.645 --> 06:55.047
The official line was that
it wasn't even worth the risk

06:55.082 --> 07:01.419
to try and rescue him.

07:01.454 --> 07:05.057
It would've been worth it to me.

07:29.482 --> 07:32.650
Commander.

07:32.685 --> 07:34.652
Did you recover the weapon?

07:34.687 --> 07:37.490
They located the plane, but the
weapon was nowhere to be found.

07:50.703 --> 07:53.070
My troops found your plane.

07:53.105 --> 07:55.107
A 9-ton jet sitting
in the middle of a field.

07:55.142 --> 07:57.109
That's not hard.

07:57.510 --> 07:59.111
But no sign of the pvg weapon.

07:59.512 --> 08:01.078
What's that?

08:01.113 --> 08:03.881
We don't have time
to play games, captain.

08:03.916 --> 08:05.918
If the government troops
get to it before we do,

08:05.953 --> 08:07.520
you'll have outlived
your usefulness.

08:07.555 --> 08:09.086
Look, lady...

08:09.121 --> 08:13.125
<laughing> i don't know
what you're talking about.

08:15.127 --> 08:21.534
<whistling>

08:23.936 --> 08:25.538
okay, we're on
morrison's approach path.

08:25.938 --> 08:27.139
I can't see a thing.

08:27.174 --> 08:28.358
I'm bringing her down.

08:28.393 --> 08:29.542
Hey, adam, you reading us?

08:29.577 --> 08:31.108
Loud and clear.

08:31.143 --> 08:33.145
Adam, we're about ten clicks
from morrison's last position.

08:33.179 --> 08:34.712
Now, hold it.

08:34.746 --> 08:36.749
I've got your altitude
at a thousand feet.

08:36.784 --> 08:38.316
Yeah, and dropping.

08:38.351 --> 08:39.952
Low ceiling, adam,
you can't see a thing.

08:39.986 --> 08:41.118
Gotta bring her down.

08:41.153 --> 08:42.355
It's our only chance
to find the plane.

08:42.755 --> 08:43.921
You're in hostile airspace.

08:43.956 --> 08:45.157
At that altitude
you're too vulnerable.

08:45.558 --> 08:46.724
No, we're in stealth mode.

08:46.759 --> 08:49.161
You're invisible,
but not armoured in
the middle of a war zone.

08:49.196 --> 08:51.163
Look, adam, if you
want us to find this thing,

08:51.198 --> 08:52.765
we're going to
have to take that chance.

08:53.165 --> 08:55.568
There's the plane.

08:55.603 --> 08:57.935
All right.

08:57.970 --> 09:00.738
Guys, i'm not getting
the signal beacon.

09:00.773 --> 09:03.175
Device must've been
separated from the plane.

09:03.576 --> 09:06.779
Well, let's circle
around and land.

09:06.814 --> 09:08.381
All right.

09:09.982 --> 09:11.984
Oh! Oh!

09:14.787 --> 09:15.553
Dammit!

09:15.588 --> 09:16.389
We've been hit!

09:16.789 --> 09:17.590
Computer systems are failing!

09:17.990 --> 09:19.992
Okay, hold on, guys.

09:39.211 --> 09:42.380
Brennan? Emma?!

09:42.415 --> 09:45.217
Anybody, do you read me?

09:59.465 --> 10:03.269
<coughing>

10:03.304 --> 10:07.073
adam?!

10:07.473 --> 10:08.674
Adam, can you hear us?

10:08.709 --> 10:10.241
It's out.

10:10.276 --> 10:11.842
So is the computer system.

10:11.877 --> 10:14.079
Comlinks'll work
short range, but...

10:14.114 --> 10:16.282
we're out of
range for sanctuary.

10:16.317 --> 10:17.500
Can you get it working?

10:17.535 --> 10:18.684
I don't know. I'll try.

10:19.085 --> 10:20.651
Come on.

10:20.686 --> 10:22.288
Should be government
troops all over the forest
looking for the plane.

10:22.323 --> 10:23.854
So you guys fix the helix.

10:23.889 --> 10:27.093
We're going to go find the pvg.

10:55.521 --> 10:56.722
Hey.

10:57.123 --> 10:58.324
Did you get anything?

10:58.359 --> 10:59.890
No.

10:59.925 --> 11:02.293
Beacon must be out of range.

11:02.328 --> 11:04.330
So if morris's plane is back
that way and the beacon's not

11:04.730 --> 11:06.732
on the plane,
then he may have jettisoned
it somewhere close by.

11:06.767 --> 11:08.734
Yeah. Unless someone
else has it already.

11:08.769 --> 11:09.900
Yeah. Don't go there.

11:09.935 --> 11:11.137
Look, why don't
we split up again?

11:11.537 --> 11:13.939
We'll cover more ground.

11:14.740 --> 11:17.508
Kovakhstan.

11:17.543 --> 11:20.145
What are you doing?

11:20.180 --> 11:22.748
Watching your back.

11:23.149 --> 11:27.153
I don't usually allow
myself to open up fully.

11:27.553 --> 11:31.557
But if i do i'll
be able to sense anyone
coming within half a mile.

11:31.592 --> 11:33.124
Nice.

11:33.159 --> 11:35.161
Psychic burglar alarm, huh?

11:35.561 --> 11:39.130
Just do me a favour?

11:39.165 --> 11:45.171
When i open up like
this, i'm open to everything.

11:45.206 --> 11:48.374
Yeah, what you getting at?

11:48.774 --> 11:55.181
Just try and think
nice thoughts is all.

11:55.216 --> 12:01.187
Yeah.

12:04.790 --> 12:06.357
Wait.

12:06.392 --> 12:07.993
I'm getting a
signal from the beacon.

12:08.028 --> 12:09.160
It's weak, but it's there.

12:09.195 --> 12:11.197
I'm sending you
the coordinates now.

12:15.201 --> 12:17.603
Got it. I'm on my way.

12:31.617 --> 12:34.820
Agh... ugh... uh!

13:05.251 --> 13:07.653
<panting> it's not nice
to think those kinds of thoughts

13:07.688 --> 13:10.055
about your partner.

13:10.090 --> 13:11.257
No.

13:11.657 --> 13:14.460
I was just...
umm... i... i thought
that i wasn't thinking...

13:16.862 --> 13:18.464
come on. It's just that
you were looking so...

13:18.864 --> 13:20.466
it's okay.

13:20.866 --> 13:23.669
I could spend
my whole life fielding those
kinds of emotions from men.

13:24.069 --> 13:28.474
With my normal defences up
i can usually filter them out.

13:28.509 --> 13:30.841
It's got to be tough.

13:30.876 --> 13:34.079
Having to live with
your defenses up all the time.

13:34.480 --> 13:41.687
Before i met adam, i didn't
know how to control my power.

13:42.087 --> 13:48.093
And i felt everything
that anybody else felt,

13:48.128 --> 13:54.099
as strongly as they felt it.

13:55.701 --> 14:00.105
You want to talk about
a short-cut to a breakdown, huh.

14:00.506 --> 14:02.908
Let's just say
defences are better.

14:04.510 --> 14:07.278
So you wouldn't mind if, uh...

14:07.313 --> 14:10.916
i mean,
if i had those kind of thoughts
again, you'd understand?

14:10.951 --> 14:13.319
I can guarantee you'll
never have one of those thoughts

14:13.354 --> 14:17.723
again - about anybody, ever.

14:20.526 --> 14:22.928
You know, i got to, uh...

14:23.329 --> 14:25.731
i gotta get back to work.

14:43.349 --> 14:44.950
Okay, here's the spot.

14:44.985 --> 14:46.552
Now where's the box?

15:00.566 --> 15:02.568
Whoo. Come to poppa.

15:15.381 --> 15:16.982
Hey, shal, i found it.

15:17.017 --> 15:17.783
Great.

15:18.183 --> 15:19.385
Get it back to the double helix.

15:19.420 --> 15:20.603
I'll meet you there.

15:20.638 --> 15:21.787
I can't do that.

15:21.822 --> 15:22.953
What?

15:22.988 --> 15:24.590
I gotta get that
pilot out before we go.

15:24.625 --> 15:25.791
Brennan, that's not the mission.

15:26.191 --> 15:28.994
It's my mission.

15:35.801 --> 15:37.403
We gotta get out of here.

15:43.409 --> 15:45.776
Okay.

15:45.811 --> 15:48.213
I disabled the homing
beacons so the government
guys won't find it.

15:48.248 --> 15:49.815
Brennan, don't do this.

15:50.215 --> 15:51.817
I'm going to hide
the pvg before i go in.

15:52.217 --> 15:53.384
Brennan.

15:53.419 --> 15:55.821
I'll call you when
i'm bringing him out.

15:55.856 --> 15:58.223
Brennan.

16:00.225 --> 16:01.427
Jess, did you hear that?

16:01.827 --> 16:02.993
Yeah, i heard everything.

16:03.028 --> 16:04.630
Never figured brennan
for a death wish, huh?

16:05.030 --> 16:06.231
I'm going after him.

16:06.266 --> 16:07.398
No! No, no, no.

16:07.433 --> 16:09.034
Look, there's no sense
in both of you getting killed.

16:09.069 --> 16:10.200
Get back here.

16:10.235 --> 16:11.802
I've almost got
this computer back online.

16:11.837 --> 16:13.439
Once i do, we can get
a location off his comlink

16:13.839 --> 16:15.040
and we'll all
go get him together.

16:15.441 --> 16:18.644
I'm on my way back.

16:18.679 --> 16:20.646
Good.

16:49.475 --> 16:52.277
Bring him to the camp.

16:59.351 --> 17:00.918
How much longer?

17:00.953 --> 17:03.355
Look, your bugging me every
five seconds is not going to

17:03.390 --> 17:05.758
make this happen
any sooner, okay?

17:06.157 --> 17:11.363
<sighs>
- all right.

17:16.568 --> 17:18.770
Communications are up.

17:18.805 --> 17:20.973
See, bugging you did work.

17:21.008 --> 17:22.539
Hey, adam.

17:22.574 --> 17:24.175
Adam, can you hear me?

17:24.211 --> 17:25.778
Shalimar?

17:26.178 --> 17:29.381
I didn't know if
you were dead or alive.

17:29.416 --> 17:32.950
How are the others?

17:32.985 --> 17:34.586
Well, one of
us isn't doing so hot.

17:34.987 --> 17:36.588
Got a few problems here.

17:36.623 --> 17:37.790
What are they?

17:38.190 --> 17:39.391
Look, adam, the
computer system is down.

17:39.792 --> 17:41.393
I've managed to bring
up the communications,

17:41.428 --> 17:43.012
but we can't run the helix yet.

17:43.047 --> 17:44.561
The programming's all blown out.

17:44.596 --> 17:46.999
All right, jesse,
if you can patch me in,

17:47.034 --> 17:49.001
maybe i can upload it from here.

17:49.036 --> 17:50.167
I'll try.

17:50.202 --> 17:51.804
Hey, adam, i think we've
got a bigger problem here.

17:51.839 --> 17:53.005
It's brennan.

17:53.405 --> 17:54.571
What about him?

17:54.606 --> 17:56.608
Well, he took off on
his own to find the pilot.

17:56.643 --> 17:57.810
<sighs> dammit.

17:57.845 --> 17:59.812
All right.

18:00.212 --> 18:01.779
Shalimar, retrace his route.

18:01.814 --> 18:04.216
Jesse'll feed you his
comlink coordinates as soon

18:04.251 --> 18:06.618
as i can get the
computer back online.

18:06.653 --> 18:08.185
Okay.

18:08.220 --> 18:09.822
All right, jesse, patch me in.

18:09.857 --> 18:13.425
Yeah.

18:13.826 --> 18:15.427
Look, i should have
said something earlier.

18:15.462 --> 18:16.994
But i...

18:17.029 --> 18:19.031
i think i found
out why brennan got so
worked up about the pilot.

18:19.431 --> 18:21.033
His father was
a pilot in vietnam.

18:21.433 --> 18:23.000
He was shot down and
the government left him behind.

18:23.035 --> 18:25.838
You know, i think he figures
that he couldn't help his dad,

18:25.873 --> 18:27.439
but maybe he can help this guy.

18:27.840 --> 18:30.242
Yeah, or maybe he'll
just get himself killed.

18:30.277 --> 18:33.045
Call you when i find him.

18:39.051 --> 18:41.053
Hey.
- What's going on?

18:45.057 --> 18:47.459
You're a prisoner of the
liberation army of kovakhstan.

18:47.494 --> 18:49.827
Oh, lucky me.

18:49.862 --> 18:51.463
What are you doing here?

18:51.864 --> 18:53.831
I heard the girls
here were knockouts.

18:53.866 --> 18:56.468
Guess i should've asked
what they meant by that.

18:56.503 --> 18:59.071
Under the articles of
war, you're not in uniform,

18:59.106 --> 19:01.038
therefore you're a spy.

19:01.073 --> 19:02.674
You know what
the rules for spies are.

19:03.075 --> 19:05.077
I didn't think people in this
war subscribed to any rules.

19:05.112 --> 19:06.643
We don't.

19:06.678 --> 19:08.645
Makes things neater.

19:08.680 --> 19:10.682
You're here to recover
the pvg device, admit it.

19:11.083 --> 19:12.684
I don't know anything
about any device.

19:12.719 --> 19:15.452
I came here to rescue a pilot.

19:15.487 --> 19:18.690
We know about
the device and we're already
tracking the homing beacon.

19:18.725 --> 19:21.110
He's of no use. Kill him.

19:21.145 --> 19:23.460
Hey, no. Wait. Wait! Wait.

19:23.495 --> 19:24.696
This beacon that
you're talking about,

19:24.731 --> 19:26.698
sounds like
the one in my pocket.

19:26.733 --> 19:29.501
Want to check?

19:43.515 --> 19:45.917
Now if you want
to see that device,

19:45.952 --> 19:48.320
killing me may
not be such a good idea.

19:51.123 --> 19:55.527
Put him in a cell.

19:57.529 --> 19:59.096
You don't believe him.

19:59.131 --> 20:02.334
If he wants to see the american
pilot, he'll get his wish.

20:08.340 --> 20:10.542
Uh. Ow.

20:10.577 --> 20:12.744
Huh...

20:39.972 --> 20:42.339
captain morrison, you okay?

20:42.374 --> 20:45.177
You're american. What the hell
are you doing here?

20:45.212 --> 20:46.395
Came here to get you out.

20:46.430 --> 20:47.579
Get me out? Who are you?

20:47.980 --> 20:49.546
Brennan mulwray.

20:49.581 --> 20:51.548
Are they treating you okay?

20:51.583 --> 20:53.585
Well, it's not exactly
a day at the spa, but i'm alive.

20:53.986 --> 20:55.187
You're not military.

20:55.222 --> 20:56.753
No.

20:56.788 --> 20:58.790
They sent me in to get the
pvg, but i'm not just going to

20:59.191 --> 21:00.757
leave you stuck in here.

21:00.792 --> 21:02.594
Unless you got a company
of marines out in the woods,

21:02.629 --> 21:04.396
i don't think there's
much chance of either of us

21:04.431 --> 21:06.015
getting out of this one.

21:06.050 --> 21:07.564
I came with friends.

21:07.599 --> 21:09.201
They're not marines, but they
definitely have their own way

21:09.236 --> 21:10.367
of getting things done.

21:10.402 --> 21:12.004
Plus, i told that dragon
lady i know where the pvg is.

21:12.404 --> 21:14.006
So, unless i missed my guess,
it's going to buy us some time.

21:14.041 --> 21:15.207
You know where it is?

21:15.242 --> 21:16.373
Yeah.

21:16.408 --> 21:17.574
So with any luck,

21:17.609 --> 21:20.012
we can get that device and
you out of here in one piece.

21:41.233 --> 21:42.434
You and you, take a walk.

21:42.469 --> 21:43.853
You guys go with him.

21:43.888 --> 21:45.237
All right, yes sir.

21:45.637 --> 21:46.838
I need two men over here.

21:46.873 --> 21:48.840
Okay.

22:07.659 --> 22:09.261
So you got any family?

22:09.661 --> 22:12.429
Two kids. Boy and
a girl, four and two.

22:12.464 --> 22:15.667
Started fresh when i
was just out of the academy.

22:16.068 --> 22:19.271
Worry more about what's going
to happen to them than what's

22:19.306 --> 22:21.638
going to happen to me.

22:21.673 --> 22:23.675
You know, growing
up without a dad?

22:24.076 --> 22:26.878
Yeah, i know what
you're talking about.

22:26.913 --> 22:32.484
It happened
to me, vietnam, '71.

22:32.519 --> 22:34.486
I'm sorry to hear that.

22:34.886 --> 22:37.689
I'm not going to let
that happen to your kids.

22:37.724 --> 22:39.909
You really are
crazy, aren't you?

22:39.944 --> 22:42.059
But you want to know something?

22:42.094 --> 22:45.297
Your father would
be pretty damn proud of you.

22:55.307 --> 22:58.075
Morrison, out.

22:58.110 --> 23:00.112
Where are you taking him?

23:00.147 --> 23:02.114
Where are you taking him?!

23:02.149 --> 23:04.081
Don't worry.

23:04.116 --> 23:06.518
We're just going to play a bit.

23:13.725 --> 23:15.927
Agh... huh.

23:15.962 --> 23:18.130
Aggh... aggh.

23:20.932 --> 23:22.934
Where are you taking him?!

23:39.351 --> 23:42.119
Jesse.
- Yeah, here.

23:42.154 --> 23:44.556
Any thoughts we
had about being in ahead

23:44.956 --> 23:46.958
of the government
boys were a dream.

23:46.993 --> 23:48.960
Moving in.

24:04.976 --> 24:06.178
Okay, adam, i think we got it.

24:06.578 --> 24:09.346
Good. All right.

24:09.381 --> 24:14.586
I'm powering up... now.

24:14.621 --> 24:19.756
Yeah!

24:19.791 --> 24:21.393
Oh... ah...

24:21.428 --> 24:22.812
damn!

24:22.847 --> 24:24.161
Aw.

24:24.196 --> 24:26.163
Adam, we lost.

24:26.198 --> 24:27.764
It's back to the drawing board.

24:27.799 --> 24:29.000
All right, jesse,
just get back into it.

24:29.035 --> 24:30.419
We don't have any options.

24:30.454 --> 24:31.803
We don't have a lot of time.

24:31.838 --> 24:33.822
Yeah.

24:33.857 --> 24:35.807
- Jesse

24:41.012 --> 24:42.614
there's people
coming from three points,

24:42.649 --> 24:44.581
all moving in this direction.

24:44.616 --> 24:47.018
I could get the helix into
stealth mode until i get the

24:47.053 --> 24:48.620
computers online.

24:49.020 --> 24:50.222
We're going to
have to take them out.

24:50.257 --> 24:52.989
I'll do it.

24:53.024 --> 24:54.626
It's what i'm
going to broadcast,

24:55.026 --> 24:56.228
they're going to be more scared
than they've ever been before.

24:56.263 --> 24:57.429
What?

24:57.829 --> 24:59.396
This is going broadband.

24:59.431 --> 25:00.632
You might want
to hold on to something.

25:00.667 --> 25:03.034
I'll be okay.

25:17.048 --> 25:19.050
They're gone.

25:19.451 --> 25:22.619
Oh... it's okay.

25:22.654 --> 25:26.258
They're gone now, but
they're going to be back soon.

25:26.293 --> 25:28.260
We have to get brennan
and shalimar back.

25:28.295 --> 25:30.227
Oh my god, emma.

25:30.262 --> 25:32.664
I had no idea you could
do something like that.

25:32.699 --> 25:36.633
Jesse?
- What?

25:36.668 --> 25:39.671
You still don't know.

25:39.706 --> 25:42.674
Oh... i don't know what?

25:43.074 --> 25:45.442
Nothing. Come on.

25:45.477 --> 25:49.481
Let's get back to work.

26:20.312 --> 26:21.513
What'd they do to you?

26:21.913 --> 26:23.079
Said she's tired of waiting.

26:23.114 --> 26:24.716
She wants to
know where the box is.

26:24.751 --> 26:26.318
You don't even
know where the box is.

26:26.353 --> 26:27.484
She doesn't believe that.

26:27.519 --> 26:29.486
But they're going
to be coming back soon.

26:29.521 --> 26:31.523
But you can't give in
no matter what happens to me.

26:31.558 --> 26:33.124
What are you talking about?

26:33.525 --> 26:37.128
If she doesn't get that device
in an hour, i'm a dead man.

26:58.283 --> 27:00.285
Jesse.
- Yeah, we're here.

27:00.685 --> 27:01.851
What's going on, shal?

27:01.886 --> 27:03.488
I found base camp.
- Excellent.

27:03.888 --> 27:05.490
Look, i think i've almost
got the computers online here.

27:05.525 --> 27:06.691
Get back, we'll
go on with the helix.

27:07.092 --> 27:08.693
No. It's going to take too long.

27:08.728 --> 27:09.912
I think i can get him out.

27:09.947 --> 27:11.096
I just need to time it right.

27:11.496 --> 27:12.662
No.

27:12.697 --> 27:13.863
You can't risk this alone.

27:13.898 --> 27:15.500
We don't even
know if he's stili...

27:15.900 --> 27:17.067
alive?

27:17.102 --> 27:19.069
Kind of been wondering that.

27:19.104 --> 27:24.309
Look, if there's any change
at all i have to do it now.

27:24.344 --> 27:26.276
All right, shal, good luck.

27:26.311 --> 27:30.315
I'll call you
when we get online.

28:05.950 --> 28:07.952
I went over this
thing ten ways from sunday.

28:08.353 --> 28:09.954
They knew exactly
what they were doing.

28:09.989 --> 28:11.556
Uh... uh.

28:11.956 --> 28:13.523
Gotta be a way out of here.

28:13.558 --> 28:15.560
Well, even if we break out
of these ropes, we still have to

28:15.595 --> 28:17.962
take out half the rebel
army just to get out of here.

28:18.363 --> 28:19.929
Well, we're not finished yet.

28:19.964 --> 28:21.966
You really believe
that, don't you?

28:22.367 --> 28:24.369
Uh.

28:24.404 --> 28:26.371
Ugh!

28:29.174 --> 28:30.775
Tell you what, if
i wasn't in this water,

28:30.810 --> 28:33.578
it'd be a whole other story.

28:35.980 --> 28:37.782
Agh...

28:37.817 --> 28:39.584
ugh.

28:50.395 --> 28:51.596
Okay, adam, we're online.

28:51.996 --> 28:53.163
Good.

28:53.198 --> 28:57.202
I've got electrical systems,
cabin pressure, sensors... damn.

28:57.237 --> 28:59.204
No, the flight
systems are still down.

28:59.239 --> 29:01.171
So are the stealth systems.

29:01.206 --> 29:03.608
<sighs> well, i don't
think we missed anything.

29:03.643 --> 29:05.610
Let's just go over it again.

29:05.645 --> 29:07.629
All right...

29:07.664 --> 29:09.579
wait, jesse.

29:09.614 --> 29:12.817
I'm uploading another
fix on the stealth system.

29:12.852 --> 29:15.220
I need you to implement it fast.

29:15.255 --> 29:16.821
Why? What's going on?

29:17.222 --> 29:20.024
My satellite imaging shows
a convoy of what appears to be

29:20.059 --> 29:26.030
government troops
heading your way.

29:35.640 --> 29:36.841
Jesse, he's right.

29:37.242 --> 29:38.443
They're going to
be on us in a few minutes.

29:38.478 --> 29:39.609
All right.

29:39.644 --> 29:42.447
I'm working as fast as i can.

30:26.090 --> 30:26.891
Never figured you
for a stick in the mud.

30:27.292 --> 30:28.493
Now that's funny.
I was worried about you.

30:28.893 --> 30:30.495
You were worried about me?
- Yeah.

30:30.895 --> 30:32.096
Has jesse got the
helix up and running?

30:32.131 --> 30:33.298
Not yet. He's working on it.

30:34.499 --> 30:36.100
Yeah, well it works better
when he doesn't know who his

30:36.135 --> 30:38.503
backup's going to be.

30:39.304 --> 30:41.706
Agh!

30:43.308 --> 30:44.509
Who the hell are you people?

30:44.909 --> 30:47.712
Get us out of these things, huh?

30:59.324 --> 31:02.126
Go.

31:02.927 --> 31:05.730
Great.

31:07.332 --> 31:08.533
Shal, you go to the helix.

31:08.568 --> 31:10.099
I'll get the pvg.

31:10.134 --> 31:12.136
No, i didn't like
what happened last time
you went off on your own.

31:12.537 --> 31:14.138
We're going together.

31:14.173 --> 31:15.705
Shal, no.

31:15.740 --> 31:18.943
We're going together.

31:27.352 --> 31:28.953
Ugh... ugh...!

31:30.555 --> 31:31.756
Aaagh!

32:00.985 --> 32:03.388
It's good to be grounded.

32:29.814 --> 32:32.216
Okay, stealth systems
are checking out.

32:32.251 --> 32:35.036
Try them now.

32:35.071 --> 32:37.787
It's not working.

32:37.822 --> 32:39.624
Adam, what's going on?

32:39.659 --> 32:41.391
Why aren't they working?

32:41.426 --> 32:43.393
Well, got some
sort of a power drain.

32:43.428 --> 32:45.830
Why don't you run a system
scan, see if you can locate it.

32:45.865 --> 32:47.832
I don't have
time for a system scan.

32:47.867 --> 32:49.033
It takes time.

32:49.434 --> 32:50.635
I got about two minutes
then i'm target practice for the

32:51.035 --> 32:52.201
whole kovakhstan army.

32:52.236 --> 32:54.238
Then don't waste time
talking about it, just do it.

32:54.273 --> 32:57.842
All right.

33:05.850 --> 33:07.452
Yes, it's a power drain,
but i don't have time to fix it.

33:07.487 --> 33:09.871
<sighs> all right,
then shut it down.

33:09.906 --> 33:12.256
Kill all systems,
put power into stealth.

33:12.291 --> 33:15.460
We're on it.

33:18.262 --> 33:20.665
Okay.

33:22.667 --> 33:26.270
Come on, come on, come on.

33:35.880 --> 33:37.482
<sighs>

33:47.492 --> 33:51.496
okay. You're clear.

33:56.300 --> 33:57.902
All right. Fine.

33:57.937 --> 33:59.869
Good going.

33:59.904 --> 34:04.308
Now let's see if we can get this
big bad bird back in the air.

34:10.715 --> 34:11.916
Thank you.

34:12.315 --> 34:17.922
We knew you'd lead us to
the device, one way or another.

34:17.956 --> 34:19.489
Yeah?

34:19.524 --> 34:21.125
We're not going
to just let you have it.

34:21.525 --> 34:22.726
Of course not.

34:51.255 --> 34:53.658
Get down!

34:58.463 --> 35:00.465
Come on!

35:04.469 --> 35:06.871
Go, go, go!

35:16.481 --> 35:18.448
Emma. Jesse.

35:18.483 --> 35:20.450
Oh, brennan, thank god.

35:20.485 --> 35:21.686
We're not out of the woods yet.

35:22.086 --> 35:23.287
The rebels are right behind us.

35:23.322 --> 35:24.854
How's the helix?

35:24.889 --> 35:26.491
Well, we're on partial power,
but we're bringing all the

35:26.526 --> 35:27.692
systems online now.

35:28.092 --> 35:28.893
We're heading back now.

35:29.293 --> 35:30.094
Good.

35:30.495 --> 35:31.661
We got a guest.

35:31.696 --> 35:33.297
Be ready for take-off
as soon as we get there.

35:38.102 --> 35:40.470
C'mon, stop!

35:40.505 --> 35:42.106
Hey, let me help.

35:42.507 --> 35:44.108
Go! Go! Guys!

35:46.511 --> 35:48.112
Where are we going?!

35:50.915 --> 35:52.116
They're right on
our heels! We gotta go!

35:52.151 --> 35:55.720
All right. Here goes nothing.

35:56.120 --> 35:56.921
What are you doing? Come on.

35:57.321 --> 35:58.488
What?

35:58.523 --> 36:00.124
I'm picking up some activity
about two miles from here.

36:00.159 --> 36:03.292
Come on!

36:03.327 --> 36:04.929
Looks like government aircraft.

36:05.329 --> 36:06.931
Two planes and
they're headed this way.

36:14.539 --> 36:16.541
Okay, we got partial power,
but we do not have enough juice

36:16.576 --> 36:18.543
to stay in stealth mode
and get up a full head of steam.

36:18.943 --> 36:20.545
Well, then kick
us out of stealth.

36:20.580 --> 36:22.111
All right.

36:22.146 --> 36:23.748
We are not going to win
any race against a fighter jet.

36:23.783 --> 36:24.966
Well, we don't have a choice.

36:25.001 --> 36:26.150
So we got to take our chances.

36:26.185 --> 36:28.518
All right.

36:28.553 --> 36:29.754
Everybody ready?

36:29.789 --> 36:31.773
Yeah.

36:31.808 --> 36:33.758
Go!

37:02.186 --> 37:05.389
Jets approaching. They're on us.

37:10.995 --> 37:12.597
Missiles. Look out!

37:37.421 --> 37:39.023
That was too close.

37:39.423 --> 37:41.791
Nice job.

37:41.826 --> 37:44.428
They're moving back
into position, brennan.

37:44.463 --> 37:47.031
Okay, look, i'm
going to try something.

37:47.066 --> 37:48.850
Hold onto your seats, guys.

37:48.885 --> 37:50.635
This is going to be close.

37:50.670 --> 37:53.037
Get ready to dive.

37:53.072 --> 37:56.641
Go!

38:14.659 --> 38:16.260
They're coming back at us.

38:16.295 --> 38:17.827
But they have missile lock.

38:17.862 --> 38:21.065
I'm not going to
be able to do that again.

38:27.872 --> 38:29.473
Jesse, you have
to phase the helix.

38:29.508 --> 38:30.640
I can't do that.

38:30.675 --> 38:31.876
But we don't
have any other choice!

38:31.911 --> 38:33.094
Just do it!

38:33.129 --> 38:34.278
You can try!

38:34.679 --> 38:35.845
Jesse, you have to.

38:35.880 --> 38:37.681
You don't have a choice.

38:37.716 --> 38:39.400
They're getting closer.

38:39.435 --> 38:41.085
Come on, jesse, please.

38:41.120 --> 38:42.303
Jess, come on!

38:42.338 --> 38:43.513
Come on, jess!

38:43.548 --> 38:44.654
Jesse. Do it!

38:44.689 --> 38:47.892
C'mon man. Come on.

38:48.292 --> 38:49.894
Come on!

39:04.709 --> 39:07.511
Oh, come on, jesse...

39:07.546 --> 39:10.314
aggghhh...!

39:15.920 --> 39:17.922
Aggghhh...!

39:32.737 --> 39:35.905
Yeah!

39:35.940 --> 39:38.307
What the hell was that?!

39:38.342 --> 39:41.145
Is that what it
feels like when you phase?

39:41.180 --> 39:44.348
I don't think
i could do that again.

39:44.383 --> 39:45.514
Yeah?

39:45.549 --> 39:47.952
Well, we may not have to.

39:50.354 --> 39:53.958
Whew... oh!

39:55.960 --> 39:57.962
Direct hit.

39:57.997 --> 40:01.165
Yes.

40:09.173 --> 40:11.976
His buddy's bugging out.

40:12.011 --> 40:13.943
Nice job, you guys.

40:13.978 --> 40:16.380
You got any more
surprises up your sleeves?

40:16.415 --> 40:18.382
Permission to
take you home, captain.

40:18.417 --> 40:20.785
Permission granted, brennan.

40:21.185 --> 40:24.789
Let's go home.

40:32.797 --> 40:35.164
This is unacceptable.

40:35.199 --> 40:37.967
You interfered with
an official operation.

40:38.002 --> 40:41.205
You stole government property
and i do not care how much

40:41.240 --> 40:45.226
hush-hush political
juice you've got.

40:45.261 --> 40:49.178
This time you're
going to answer for it.

40:49.213 --> 40:52.016
Uh, well, general, let's
get a couple of things straight.

40:52.051 --> 40:53.582
First of all,

40:53.617 --> 40:56.821
i think you'd have a hell of
a time proving i did anything.

40:56.856 --> 41:00.024
Secondly, this so-called
stolen government property?

41:00.424 --> 41:02.426
It was obtained fraudulently.

41:02.827 --> 41:05.629
And i don't
think that's something
that you want made public.

41:05.664 --> 41:11.600
Or, how you were
planning to test it.

41:11.635 --> 41:16.841
You always get your
own way, don't you, kane?

41:16.876 --> 41:19.243
Well, no, actually, i don't.

41:19.643 --> 41:21.610
<laughing> not often enough.

41:21.645 --> 41:24.048
But i'll tell you
something, times like this,

41:24.083 --> 41:30.054
they kind of make up for that.

41:33.257 --> 41:34.859
So how did he react to that?

41:35.259 --> 41:36.460
Well, he didn't
blow any blood vessels,

41:36.861 --> 41:38.262
but he's working on it.

41:38.297 --> 41:39.628
What about morrison?

41:39.663 --> 41:41.665
He's back with his
family... thanks to you.

41:42.066 --> 41:44.068
You did a good thing
going in to save him, brennan.

41:44.103 --> 41:46.070
Well, i figured
it was the thing to do.

41:46.105 --> 41:48.472
Your father would've been proud.

41:50.074 --> 41:51.675
You knew?

41:54.478 --> 41:59.283
And just for the
record, we're all proud.
