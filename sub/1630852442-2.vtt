WEBVTT

00:22.520 --> 00:24.840
-Are you coming for lunch?
-No, I haven't got time.

00:24.920 --> 00:27.360
We need to eat
before we start the investigation.

00:28.480 --> 00:31.640
I feel like meat today,
just like yesterday, actually.

00:31.720 --> 00:36.040
I'll have lunch later today.
I want to interview the Bergvalls first.

00:36.120 --> 00:39.840
-Roger and that Anna-Lena.
-Was it Bergvall?

00:40.960 --> 00:43.560
Not Goldfish?
They couldn't remember a thing.

00:43.640 --> 00:45.640
They hardly recognized each other.

00:45.720 --> 00:47.960
You don't need to come.

00:51.520 --> 00:52.880
How was New Year's?

00:53.840 --> 00:54.680
It was okay.

00:55.240 --> 00:58.840
Did you tell your sister
about the discounted haircut?

00:59.760 --> 01:02.160
Something came up,
and she couldn't make it.

01:02.760 --> 01:04.320
-Didn't she come?
-No.

01:04.400 --> 01:06.400
Right. So what happened?

01:06.480 --> 01:09.520
I'm in a bit of a rush,
so speak later, Milou.

01:09.600 --> 01:12.400
How's the case going?
Have you found the robber?

01:12.480 --> 01:16.320
I can't discuss that now.
I need to dash. See you.

01:16.400 --> 01:20.360
I think you'll solve it.
That's what I keep telling people.

01:20.440 --> 01:23.000
-"Try to trust Jack."
-So, the Bergvalls?

01:23.520 --> 01:25.400
Yes, I've looked into them.

01:26.120 --> 01:32.000
Did you know that they've bought
three apartments in the last four years?

01:32.080 --> 01:36.720
The last one they got
for 325,000 below market value.

01:36.800 --> 01:39.480
I've got their call logs as well.

01:39.560 --> 01:44.000
The wife, Anna-Lena,
has not been entirely honest.

01:44.080 --> 01:45.720
-Really?
-Yes, she's lying.

02:04.680 --> 02:07.880
What did you tell the police?

02:07.960 --> 02:09.000
Stop it.

02:10.680 --> 02:12.800
Why do they want to speak to us?

02:13.960 --> 02:15.960
I don't know. I didn't tell them a thing.

02:16.960 --> 02:18.440
I did exactly as we'd agreed.

02:23.920 --> 02:27.760
Hi, great, nice. Come in.

02:27.840 --> 02:28.840
Thank you.

02:29.960 --> 02:34.480
-What happened to your nose?
-I got a flat pack right on-- Bang.

02:34.560 --> 02:37.760
-A flat pack?
-Yes. Knarrevik, Ikea. Side table.

02:37.840 --> 02:41.440
It was reduced to 99 kronor,
so I got a bit excited.

02:41.520 --> 02:43.440
-Hi.
-Hello.

02:43.520 --> 02:45.400
-Tough week.
-Yeah, kind of.

02:45.480 --> 02:47.280
I'm just making coffee.

02:47.360 --> 02:48.480
It's almost done.

02:48.560 --> 02:51.360
-Nice.
-Right, if I could start with you.

02:53.840 --> 02:54.960
Okay.

02:55.560 --> 02:56.760
Thank you.

02:58.920 --> 03:02.840
Right. Interview with Anna-Lena Bergvall.

03:02.920 --> 03:06.800
Fourth of January, 12:06.

03:08.280 --> 03:11.640
Did you get the impression that
any of the hostages knew the perp?

03:11.720 --> 03:13.960
No, I don't think so.

03:14.040 --> 03:18.280
Right. And you didn't know the perp?

03:19.920 --> 03:21.920
No, why would I?

03:24.280 --> 03:25.960
Do you know any of the hostages?

03:28.040 --> 03:30.320
-Only Roger.
-Only Roger?

03:32.880 --> 03:34.280
Are you thinking of moving?

03:35.280 --> 03:36.280
Moving? No.

03:36.360 --> 03:39.480
Did you view the apartment
on behalf of someone else?

03:40.080 --> 03:42.560
No, we renovate them. That's what we do.

03:42.640 --> 03:46.960
We buy apartments, I do the renovations,
and Anna-Lena does the interior design.

03:47.040 --> 03:49.360
Then we sell them for a profit.

03:57.640 --> 04:00.200
No! Fuck.

04:00.280 --> 04:04.280
-You don't need to worry about them.
-Can't you see she's pregnant?

04:04.360 --> 04:07.520
Pregnant women are irrational.
She'll ruin everything.

04:08.080 --> 04:11.000
As long as we stick to the plan
all will be fine.

04:12.360 --> 04:14.320
No one does this better than you.

04:17.480 --> 04:19.560
We've been doing this for 20 years.

04:20.440 --> 04:22.520
You're the best. You know that.

04:33.240 --> 04:36.080
-It's not been styled.
-Well, that's perfect.

04:39.800 --> 04:41.600
-Come in.
-Hello. Thank you.

04:41.680 --> 04:43.360
Are you the real estate agent?

04:43.440 --> 04:44.640
No, not at all.

04:44.720 --> 04:48.600
I'm here to see the apartment
on behalf of my daughter.

04:48.680 --> 04:52.720
My name is Estelle.
My husband, Knut, is just parking the car.

04:53.520 --> 04:54.440
Who are you?

04:54.520 --> 04:55.520
Why?

05:02.560 --> 05:04.800
Hi. Are you the real estate agent?

05:07.560 --> 05:08.840
Do I look like one?

05:10.640 --> 05:13.520
You need to wear shoe covers
for house viewings.

05:14.840 --> 05:17.120
-Was that the real estate agent?
-I don't think so.

05:17.200 --> 05:19.400
That makes four plus us two.

05:21.600 --> 05:22.640
Let's do it.

05:26.800 --> 05:32.080
-Let's see.
-Doesn't it smell a bit musty, Roger?

05:32.160 --> 05:33.880
Yes, you might be right.

05:38.120 --> 05:40.840
Please, think carefully.

05:40.920 --> 05:42.520
Did you know anyone else?

05:43.680 --> 05:44.760
I don't understand you.

05:44.840 --> 05:49.520
What is this? I am sure.
I told you, I only knew Roger.

05:51.040 --> 05:53.040
So you didn't know Lennart?

06:00.600 --> 06:01.440
Well…

06:02.080 --> 06:03.240
So…

06:05.480 --> 06:06.320
What?

06:09.400 --> 06:10.280
It's private.

06:12.760 --> 06:17.080
I know you rang Lennart three times
between Christmas and New Year.

06:17.160 --> 06:20.120
-Excuse me, I need to powder my nose.
-We're--

06:22.560 --> 06:25.240
-Fine. I'll be waiting here.
-Sure.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.280
I need the bathroom.

06:56.600 --> 06:58.440
-She needs the bathroom.
-What?

06:58.520 --> 07:00.240
She needs the bathroom.

07:01.200 --> 07:04.200
Are you insane?
There's a madman with a gun out there.

07:04.280 --> 07:05.120
I need to go.

07:05.200 --> 07:06.640
Why are you out and about?

07:06.720 --> 07:10.560
If you can't hold it in,
you should stay home, near a toilet.

07:10.640 --> 07:12.560
Let her pee.

07:15.280 --> 07:18.560
-Thanks a lot, Ro.
-I didn't say anything.

07:19.080 --> 07:20.320
What have I done?

07:23.800 --> 07:25.120
Hurry up, for fuck's sake.

07:25.200 --> 07:27.760
The bathroom is in the hallway.

07:34.240 --> 07:35.880
-It's occupied.
-What?

07:35.960 --> 07:38.000
-It's occupied.
-Occupied?

07:38.080 --> 07:40.200
That's not possible.

07:40.280 --> 07:41.400
We're all here.

07:44.880 --> 07:47.120
Come on, dear. I'll come with you.

07:53.960 --> 07:55.600
Hello? Is anyone there?

08:00.800 --> 08:02.000
Great, thanks.

08:02.080 --> 08:04.960
-Oh my God.
-What's going on out there?

08:05.040 --> 08:06.640
-Who are you?
-Take it easy.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.400
My name is Lennart.

08:08.480 --> 08:10.640
-I work here.
-Are you a real estate agent?

08:10.720 --> 08:13.760
No, I'm a performance artist.
I'm a performer.

08:14.760 --> 08:16.320
Speak to Anna-Lena.

08:16.400 --> 08:17.760
She can explain everything.

08:17.840 --> 08:19.680
-Talk to Anna-Lena.
-Who's that?

08:19.760 --> 08:24.600
She's the wife of the man
who wants us to do as the robber says.

08:24.680 --> 08:27.920
-Okay.
-Anna-Lena can vouch for me.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.920
How the hell do you know my wife?

08:31.560 --> 08:33.800
Oh, hello. Are you Roger?

08:33.880 --> 08:36.320
-Yes, I am. Who the hell are you?
-Lennart.

08:37.920 --> 08:40.760
Hi, Anna-Lena. It's me.

08:41.560 --> 08:44.680
I'm the slightly perverted musketeer.

08:44.760 --> 08:47.560
-I'm the one--
-I've never seen him before.

08:47.640 --> 08:50.920
Anna-Lena, I'm the performance artist.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.480
Performance artist?

08:52.560 --> 08:56.560
I perform little catastrophe dramas
in house viewing contexts.

08:56.640 --> 09:00.280
At the moment, I'm dressed as
the pooping perv musketeer.

09:00.360 --> 09:03.240
-Have you had a relationship with him?
-Are you insane?

09:03.320 --> 09:04.160
No.

09:04.240 --> 09:08.560
I nip into house viewings
and take a poop as a bunny.

09:08.640 --> 09:12.720
Or I could be the horny Casanova
hitting on everyone's wives.

09:12.800 --> 09:14.640
You sick bastard.

09:16.440 --> 09:17.360
You fucking perv!

09:17.440 --> 09:18.760
Did you fuck my wife?

09:18.840 --> 09:21.520
-You scumbag!
-Roger.

09:21.600 --> 09:24.040
-Let go of me.
-It's about the price per square foot.

09:24.120 --> 09:27.440
Lennart helps us
get the price down on the apartments.

09:27.520 --> 09:29.840
-What are you talking about?
-Roger, listen.

09:29.920 --> 09:33.000
Roger, do you remember
the red turn-of-the-century apartment

09:33.080 --> 09:33.920
at Malmvägen?

09:34.000 --> 09:36.160
-Number 22.
-Do you remember?

09:36.240 --> 09:38.560
Sure as hell I remember. Why?

09:38.640 --> 09:43.720
Do you remember the drunk neighbor
who came in and threw spaghetti?

09:43.800 --> 09:47.720
-Yes. It was him.
-Why do you think the offers were so low?

09:47.800 --> 09:51.720
We got it down by several hundred thousand
below the asking price. Thanks to whom?

09:52.360 --> 09:53.960
-What?
-Fucking hell.

09:54.040 --> 09:57.040
I don't wanna brag, Roger,

09:57.840 --> 10:01.680
but the pasta-chucking neighbor
is one of my most popular characters.

10:01.760 --> 10:03.080
I've put work into it.

10:04.280 --> 10:07.040
Do you not think I can negotiate?

10:07.120 --> 10:08.680
Of course you can.

10:10.640 --> 10:13.840
But you get so upset
when they get too expensive.

10:14.960 --> 10:16.480
It was only the one time.

10:17.640 --> 10:20.040
Or three,
if you want to be particular about it.

10:21.160 --> 10:22.240
Shut up.

10:23.400 --> 10:26.200
You know what?
It would have been better if you

10:27.120 --> 10:30.040
had fucked that perverted bastard instead.

10:30.960 --> 10:32.800
You're lying because you don't think

10:32.880 --> 10:35.240
I can do the only thing
I think I'm good at.

10:35.320 --> 10:36.320
Buying apartments.

10:36.840 --> 10:37.680
Roger.

10:41.320 --> 10:42.200
Shit.

10:47.800 --> 10:48.640
Anna-Lena?

11:02.680 --> 11:04.680
Why did you say you didn't know Lennart?

11:04.760 --> 11:08.520
-It's got nothing to do with this.
-Did you know the perpetrator as well?

11:08.600 --> 11:12.240
-No, certainly not.
-Do you know who the perpetrator is?

11:12.320 --> 11:14.040
I said no.

11:14.120 --> 11:18.920
I get the feeling that you're lying to me.

11:19.640 --> 11:20.960
I'm not lying.

11:21.040 --> 11:23.200
You've already lied about Lennart.

11:23.280 --> 11:25.680
Maybe you helped the perpetrator
escape the apartment.

11:26.240 --> 11:27.400
I was just trying to--

11:27.480 --> 11:30.840
There's no way the perpetrator
could have got out without help.

11:30.920 --> 11:34.560
Right now, you're the only one
lying to the police, Anna-Lena.

11:34.640 --> 11:36.040
That's darn serious.

11:36.120 --> 11:39.040
I'm just trying to save my marriage.

11:39.120 --> 11:40.840
What do you want me to say?

11:40.920 --> 11:44.840
Shall I tell you that
my husband's self-esteem is so low

11:44.920 --> 11:48.160
that I have to make myself small
so that he won't feel threatened?

11:48.240 --> 11:53.360
I hired someone to wreck the viewing
in order to get the price down.

11:55.960 --> 11:59.040
It's got nothing to do with
the hostage situation.

12:02.440 --> 12:03.440
Shit.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.080
Roger.

12:18.520 --> 12:19.360
How are you?

12:19.440 --> 12:21.040
I'm fine.

12:21.120 --> 12:23.400
Roger is the one who's hurt.

12:24.360 --> 12:25.200
Okay.

12:27.720 --> 12:30.800
So why isn't Roger crying, then?

12:30.880 --> 12:34.800
You don't know him.
He's actually very sensitive.

12:36.400 --> 12:40.080
I realized that when he said
pregnant women should stay home.

12:40.160 --> 12:44.360
No, he just said that
to get you away from the viewing.

12:44.440 --> 12:46.200
He doesn't hate kids.

12:46.280 --> 12:49.280
He just gets angry
when they write "kids' room" in the ad.

12:49.360 --> 12:53.120
It raises the price per square foot
like hell.

12:53.720 --> 12:59.120
Roger loves kids. He stayed home
with our kids when they were little.

13:00.360 --> 13:01.680
You're kidding, right?

13:03.200 --> 13:06.880
It wasn't meant to be like that,
but I did so well at work,

13:06.960 --> 13:08.320
it just happened like that.

13:09.160 --> 13:13.360
It wasn't meant to be forever,
only while the kids were little.

13:14.120 --> 13:19.520
When Roger got back to work
when the kids were older,

13:20.720 --> 13:23.040
he wasn't given the same kind of work

13:23.120 --> 13:25.000
or the same kind of responsibility.

13:26.320 --> 13:31.000
It totally ruins your self-esteem.
You shrink as a person.

13:33.920 --> 13:35.960
But it wasn't your fault.

13:36.040 --> 13:37.360
It wasn't Roger's either.

13:38.160 --> 13:41.200
No, neither of you were to blame.

13:42.120 --> 13:43.520
Why is he so angry with you?

13:44.200 --> 13:45.680
He's proud.

13:45.760 --> 13:49.480
The apartments are the only thing
that matter to him now.

13:50.640 --> 13:52.280
That's so like men.

13:53.160 --> 13:54.760
You were just trying to help.

13:55.840 --> 13:57.560
He'll never forgive me.

13:58.720 --> 13:59.560
Yes, he will.

14:02.280 --> 14:03.120
He will.

14:06.400 --> 14:07.480
What's your name?

14:08.120 --> 14:09.040
My name is Julia.

14:09.640 --> 14:10.560
Anna-Lena.

14:21.440 --> 14:23.000
Right, so what do you want now?

14:24.680 --> 14:27.200
-I've just got a few questions.
-A few questions. Right.

14:27.280 --> 14:31.080
My marriage is going to pot,
but you know that.

14:31.160 --> 14:33.400
Isn't that enough?
What else do you wanna know?

14:33.480 --> 14:35.080
How often I hump her?

14:37.720 --> 14:41.480
Did you know Lennart
before the hostage situation?

14:42.600 --> 14:45.320
-Did you know anyone else?
-I thought I knew my wife.

14:45.400 --> 14:50.480
But apparently you can live with someone
for 40 years without understanding shit.

14:53.480 --> 14:59.040
Would you show me on this drawing
where everyone was when the perp entered?

14:59.120 --> 15:02.120
-Please show me where you were standing.
-Sure. We were in here.

15:02.760 --> 15:07.160
The old lady was also there,
and Ro and her girlfriend came from there.

15:07.240 --> 15:08.720
So Ro and Julia came in here?

15:09.560 --> 15:11.840
What the hell? This is not right.

15:13.760 --> 15:14.600
What?

15:16.920 --> 15:18.160
The floor plan is not right.

15:18.240 --> 15:21.160
I always bring
my own yard stick to viewings.

15:21.240 --> 15:23.280
You can't trust the agent's plans.

15:23.360 --> 15:27.880
-But what is not right about it?
-There's actually a wardrobe here.

15:27.960 --> 15:30.080
This space measures at least a meter.

15:30.160 --> 15:33.160
That must mean that
there's a hidden space in the wardrobe.

15:34.160 --> 15:35.160
Do you understand?

15:38.280 --> 15:40.960
Jim? We need to get back
to the crime scene.

15:42.320 --> 15:43.400
-Come on.
-What?

15:43.480 --> 15:46.600
Come on, let's speak in the car.
Thank you, Anna-Lena.

15:51.200 --> 15:53.200
Did he hide inside the wall?

15:53.280 --> 15:55.760
Yes, there's a hidden space.

15:55.840 --> 15:58.080
That must be how the robber got away.

15:59.520 --> 16:04.600
Damn strange. A whole SWAT team
and they can't find a hole.

16:04.680 --> 16:06.360
But it's hidden.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.440
It's hidden. It's not that strange
that they couldn't find it.

16:21.320 --> 16:23.560
-It ought to be here.
-Yes.

16:26.480 --> 16:29.960
Yes, there's a door here. A big-ass door.

16:30.680 --> 16:32.840
An old dumbwaiter or something.

16:41.760 --> 16:43.160
-What is it?
-Shit.

16:43.240 --> 16:45.400
-What is it?
-Check for yourself.

16:48.720 --> 16:51.640
You're right. No one could fit in there.

16:51.720 --> 16:56.160
How can someone just go up in smoke?
It's crazy.

16:56.800 --> 16:58.040
But…

16:59.200 --> 17:01.480
-Now I know who the robber is.
-Who?

17:01.560 --> 17:03.880
-A magician.
-Yes.

17:03.960 --> 17:05.160
Sorry, bad joke.

17:05.240 --> 17:06.360
Indeed.

17:12.840 --> 17:14.920
Don't get too stuck on this.

17:15.880 --> 17:17.520
You know what this job is like.

17:18.080 --> 17:19.000
Shit.

17:21.680 --> 17:24.320
Sometimes you catch the villain,
and sometimes

17:25.120 --> 17:27.280
you have to pull yourself together
and move on.

17:27.360 --> 17:28.960
On to the next case.

17:29.600 --> 17:32.080
Well, I'm not moving on, I'm telling you.

17:32.800 --> 17:34.200
I'm gonna solve this case.

17:35.400 --> 17:36.800
Flush the toilet, please.

17:46.840 --> 17:47.960
You coming for lunch?

17:49.400 --> 17:50.440
Look at this.

17:52.520 --> 17:56.760
We ought to release this to the press
and maybe get some tip-offs.

17:57.800 --> 18:01.120
Good idea. "If you have x-ray vision,
call 911."

18:01.880 --> 18:05.800
Look at it. You can tell
some of the body shape and the eyes.

18:05.880 --> 18:07.440
The hostages are fine.

18:07.520 --> 18:09.400
No one wants to prosecute.

18:09.480 --> 18:11.800
I don't even know
what you want to investigate.

18:28.440 --> 18:30.800
We can make it to Ikea
before closing time.

18:35.040 --> 18:38.680
The January sales started today.

18:46.480 --> 18:47.960
I'm sorry, Roger.

18:48.720 --> 18:51.000
That policeman…

18:53.280 --> 18:55.080
was so hard on me.

18:55.160 --> 18:57.400
I've been there for you our entire lives.

18:57.480 --> 18:58.640
I know.

19:00.720 --> 19:04.080
Then it turns out
that our life's project was just a lie.

19:34.240 --> 19:35.160
Fuck!

19:46.560 --> 19:47.840
<i>Please, take a ticket.</i>

20:02.760 --> 20:05.240
GIVE ME 6500!

20:14.600 --> 20:17.680
Did you get
Zarah Carlström's contact details?

20:17.760 --> 20:19.440
-Who?
-Well…

20:20.400 --> 20:22.200
Zarah Carlström.

20:23.240 --> 20:24.280
Oh, her?

20:24.360 --> 20:26.760
Yes, I've got her details. Why?

20:26.840 --> 20:30.200
Why did you not mention that
she works for the bank that was robbed?

20:30.280 --> 20:31.600
Doesn't it say there?

20:31.680 --> 20:33.720
No, it says she works for a bank.

20:33.800 --> 20:35.560
Not that it's the same bank.

20:35.640 --> 20:37.720
I didn't think that was of interest.

20:38.320 --> 20:41.160
Are you saying she robbed herself?

20:41.240 --> 20:44.000
No, but it's a funny coincidence.

20:44.840 --> 20:46.480
We'll speak to her tomorrow.

20:54.880 --> 20:55.760
Anything else?

20:56.400 --> 20:58.360
Have we come across her before?

20:58.440 --> 20:59.480
I don't think so.

20:59.560 --> 21:02.760
I think I recognize that name,
Zarah Carlström.

21:02.840 --> 21:05.040
Zarah Carlström. There's…

21:05.120 --> 21:08.400
-There's something familiar about it.
-It doesn't ring any bells.

21:09.840 --> 21:10.760
Oh, well.

21:20.520 --> 21:22.320
SURVEILLANCE FILM BANK

21:22.400 --> 21:23.320
DELETE

21:26.560 --> 21:28.360
REMOVE FOLDER PERMANENTLY?

21:28.440 --> 21:29.280
YES
