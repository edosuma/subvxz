this same conversation

12:48.637 --> 12:51.679

12:51.762 --> 12:53.637
That's the head
of the Taliban talking

12:53.720 --> 12:55.720
right there in black and white,

12:55.804 --> 12:58.220

12:58.303 --> 13:02.220
We've been saying peace
is possible like a mantra,

13:02.303 --> 13:04.637
but now we have this,

13:04.720 --> 13:06.804
and we know...

13:06.887 --> 13:09.887
it may actually be possible.

13:13.136 --> 13:15.428
Haqqani's not an obstacle.
He's ready.

13:15.512 --> 13:18.512
We don't need to beg Pakistan
to bring him to the table.

13:18.595 --> 13:21.428
He'll come on his own if we
approach him the right way.

13:25.679 --> 13:28.679
The Guantanamo prisoners
we got released

13:28.762 --> 13:32.637
to keep the Taliban delegation
from leaving...

13:32.720 --> 13:34.470
one of them
was Haqqani's cousin, right?

13:34.553 --> 13:36.011
Second cousin.

13:39.011 --> 13:40.845
And they're arriving tonight.

13:43.512 --> 13:44.345
What's this?

13:44.428 --> 13:45.970
Car bomb.

13:46.053 --> 13:47.845
Happened
a year and a half ago.

13:47.929 --> 13:50.720
Young man blown to bits.
His wife watches it happen.

13:50.804 --> 13:53.095
Newlyweds.
It was all over the local news.

13:53.178 --> 13:54.720
The wife's name
was Samira Noori.

13:54.804 --> 13:56.720
She was part
of a corruption probe

13:56.804 --> 13:58.762
launched by our government.

13:58.845 --> 14:00.095
The investigation
took this turn

14:00.178 --> 14:01.804
toward our good friend,
Abdul G'ulom...

14:01.887 --> 14:03.053
- Right, I remember.
- At which point,

14:03.136 --> 14:04.637
everyone working on it
was fired.

14:04.720 --> 14:06.804
The auditors
literally disappeared.

14:06.887 --> 14:10.303
No one would say what happened
except Samira.

14:10.387 --> 14:11.970
She calls out G'ulom publicly,

14:12.053 --> 14:13.679
demands the probe
be reopened.

14:13.762 --> 14:15.387
A few days later...

14:15.470 --> 14:16.929
- Her husband dies.
- Yeah.

14:17.011 --> 14:19.720
But the bomb was
almost certainly meant for her.

14:19.804 --> 14:21.970
Well, how'd you get
onto her, anyway?

14:22.053 --> 14:24.970
Anonymous tip,
waiting for me when I got back

14:25.053 --> 14:26.136
from my meeting with G'ulom.

14:26.220 --> 14:27.303
Well, that's convenient.

14:27.387 --> 14:28.553
G'ulom's got a million enemies.

14:28.637 --> 14:29.595
It could've been any one
of them,

14:29.679 --> 14:31.053
someone in his office, even.

14:31.136 --> 14:32.470
It could be a setup.

14:32.553 --> 14:34.136
Look, I need leverage
on G'ulom.

14:34.220 --> 14:36.095
That's what Saul
brought me here to find,

14:36.178 --> 14:38.178
and right now
I've got nothing.

14:38.261 --> 14:40.470
G'ulom basically laughed me
out of his office this morning,

14:40.553 --> 14:43.428
which is why I want to stand up
an operation...

14:43.512 --> 14:46.512

- For your approval.

14:46.595 --> 14:48.512
Samira hasn't managed
to find a job

14:48.595 --> 14:50.553

she's looking, though.

14:50.637 --> 14:52.095

14:52.178 --> 14:54.053
at three recruiting sites
here in Kabul.

14:54.136 --> 14:56.470
The idea is to bring her in

14:56.553 --> 14:58.220

14:58.303 --> 15:00.178
So you want to talk to her.

15:00.261 --> 15:02.679
No, I want someone else to,
and while they're doing that,

15:02.762 --> 15:04.387
I want to take a look
through her apartment.

15:04.470 --> 15:05.553
She's a fighter.

15:05.637 --> 15:07.136
She lost her husband
over this.

15:07.220 --> 15:09.011
My bet is
there'll be something there.

15:13.011 --> 15:15.804
Let Jenna Bragg run
the interview.

15:15.887 --> 15:17.595
She set up a phony NGO

15:17.679 --> 15:19.679
that would work perfectly
for this--

15:19.762 --> 15:21.095
medical clinics or something.

15:21.178 --> 15:23.011
Didn't you say she was stuck
in the starting gate?

your forces

39:30.762 --> 39:33.345

in the villages

39:33.428 --> 39:35.136
and in the mountains,

39:35.220 --> 39:39.011
and then it will be Saigon
all over again--

39:39.095 --> 39:41.345

you massacred in the street.

39:48.762 --> 39:50.428

39:50.512 --> 39:54.470

come running to?

39:54.553 --> 39:59.345
Me, just as you did in 2001,

39:59.428 --> 40:02.512
because no one else

40:02.595 --> 40:06.053

40:07.929 --> 40:09.720
