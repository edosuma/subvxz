In Russia,

12:17.180 --> 12:19.550
it took me three years to rise
within the Moscow Ballet.

12:19.750 --> 12:20.810
I danced and danced,

12:21.010 --> 12:24.810
but still,
this is a political game.

12:25.010 --> 12:25.990
What do you mean?

12:26.190 --> 12:27.990
Earlier in my career,

12:28.190 --> 12:31.390
different directors would offer
principal roles in productions.

12:31.580 --> 12:33.080
In exchange,

12:33.280 --> 12:36.740
dancers would pay hundreds
and thousands of rubles.

12:36.940 --> 12:39.350
[scoffs]
I refuse.

12:39.550 --> 12:41.740
If I'm named principal,
I will have earned it.

12:41.940 --> 12:43.980
- Are you saying
Nicolette paid for her spot?

12:46.940 --> 12:51.140
- This note along with
a dozen roses burnt at the tips

12:51.340 --> 12:53.020

in Nicolette's dressing room.

12:53.210 --> 12:55.450

12:55.650 --> 12:57.060
"Little fat girl"?

12:57.260 --> 12:59.500
- Dancers call each other fat
to hit where it hurts.

12:59.700 --> 13:01.210
- Do you recognize
the handwriting?

13:05.430 --> 13:07.600
- The flowers
were from me, yes,

13:07.790 --> 13:09.510
but a method I use
to help dancers excel.

13:09.710 --> 13:11.640
You mean harass them.

13:11.840 --> 13:13.380
- The symbolism
behind the flowers

13:13.580 --> 13:17.040
translates to someone
who has set her soul afire.

13:17.240 --> 13:19.350
Nicolette did just that.

13:19.550 --> 13:22.350
- You've had complaints
against you within the company

13:22.550 --> 13:24.570

like a motivator.

13:25.730 --> 13:27.960
You sound like a bully.

13:28.160 --> 13:30.010

Nicolette outperformed

13:30.210 --> 13:31.360
every member of the company.

13:31.560 --> 13:32.530
The note was a means

13:32.730 --> 13:34.930

13:35.130 --> 13:37.060

exercising discipline.

13:37.260 --> 13:38.800
Real generous of you.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.760

about my behavior are true,

13:41.960 --> 13:43.890
but ruining a woman's career

13:44.090 --> 13:47.200

is gruesome.

22:48.640 --> 22:50.310

22:50.510 --> 22:52.790

for the part.

22:52.990 --> 22:54.660
- So not enough time
being your girlfriend?

22:54.860 --> 22:56.840
- You're wagging your finger
at the one person

22:57.040 --> 23:00.320
most responsible for keeping
that company in business

23:00.520 --> 23:03.630
and the last person on Earth

23:03.820 --> 23:05.450
who would want

23:05.650 --> 23:07.760

it may be giving you

23:07.960 --> 23:09.810

about Alva Boxler.

23:36.810 --> 23:39.360

but I broke up with him.

23:39.560 --> 23:41.580
What?

23:41.780 --> 23:44.880
- Two weeks ago, I couldn't
handle his secrets anymore.

23:45.080 --> 23:47.230

23:47.430 --> 23:49.060
Not well.

23:49.260 --> 23:50.760
Meaning?

23:50.960 --> 23:53.560
He was very angry.

23:55.690 --> 23:57.590
But he's not...

23:57.790 --> 23:59.120
Look, it wasn't him.

23:59.310 --> 24:01.030
I would've
recognized his voice.

24:01.230 --> 24:03.180
- Did anybody else know
about your split?

24:05.220 --> 24:07.650
- No, he asked me
not to say anything

24:07.850 --> 24:09.260
until after the performance.

24:09.460 --> 24:10.390
Did he threaten you?

24:10.590 --> 24:12.560
- I don't--
- Please.

24:12.760 --> 24:14.450
Do not protect him.

24:17.100 --> 24:20.540
- He said if I left,
I'd be sorry.

24:31.990 --> 24:33.800
- I looked into Alva Boxler
and discovered

24:34.000 --> 24:35.800
Europol's been
keeping tabs on him for years.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.330
He's connected
to several well-known

24:37.530 --> 24:38.760
underworld criminals.

24:38.960 --> 24:41.160
Alva Boxler's predecessor,
Felix Egger,

24:41.360 --> 24:42.810
was part
of the Austrian Parliament

24:43.010 --> 24:44.810
and chief interior officer
for a decade,

24:45.010 --> 24:47.210
the position
that Alva holds now.

24:47.410 --> 24:49.210
A year ago,
Felix was caught on camera

24:49.410 --> 24:52.650
attempting to accept bribes
from an account well-associated

24:52.850 --> 24:55.390
with the biggest crime family
in Austria.

24:55.590 --> 24:57.170
- He went to jail,
but he had a firewall

24:57.370 --> 24:58.520
between himself and his client.

24:58.720 --> 24:59.830
The criminals bribing Eggers

25:00.030 --> 25:01.180
expect the same favors
from Alva.

25:01.380 --> 25:03.660
- Is Alva lining his pockets
too, like his predecessor,

25:03.860 --> 25:05.620
or did he refuse
to accept them?

25:05.820 --> 25:08.500
- And was Nicolette
collateral damage?

25:16.990 --> 25:18.460
I never threatened her.

25:18.660 --> 25:21.070
- "If you break up with me,
you'll be sorry."

25:21.270 --> 25:22.290
That's pep talk?

25:22.480 --> 25:24.900
- I was hurt.
I was petulant.

25:25.100 --> 25:26.900
And I meant she'd be sorry

25:27.100 --> 25:29.290
because she'd never meet
someone like me again.

25:29.490 --> 25:30.860
I did not mean she'd be sorry

25:31.060 --> 25:33.170
because one day
I'd throw acid in her face.

25:33.370 --> 25:35.080
This is absurd!

25:35.280 --> 25:37.660

an open investigation on you.

25:39.620 --> 25:42.710
Taking bribes like
your predecessor, Felix Egger.

25:48.320 --> 25:50.920
- Appearing to take bribes
like my predecessor.

25:51.120 --> 25:53.190

25:53.390 --> 25:55.620

I'm not dirty.

25:55.820 --> 25:57.160

myself as open for business

26:03.350 --> 26:04.410

26:04.610 --> 26:06.030
Secretly, however,

26:06.220 --> 26:08.590
I have been working
with the justice ministry

26:08.790 --> 26:11.330

from whom Felix took bribes.

26:11.530 --> 26:13.420

26:19.190 --> 26:21.650

this information from us?

26:21.850 --> 26:25.220
- It's
an ongoing investigation.

26:25.420 --> 26:29.740
Because of the sensitivity
and secrecy of the case,

26:29.940 --> 26:34.310

justice ministry know about it.

26:34.510 --> 26:35.490

26:36.650 --> 26:39.450

26:39.650 --> 26:41.230

from Nicolette,

26:41.430 --> 26:43.890
which she picked up on,

26:44.090 --> 26:46.410

because of it.

Finally, you understand.

26:50.620 --> 26:52.250
- Anybody who offers it.
- We'll need proof.

26:52.440 --> 26:54.510

27:22.950 --> 27:24.760

We'll make sure we treat
Kira Sokolov fairly if you--

27:30.180 --> 27:34.590
- There's a Russian detainee,
Grigoriy Andreev,

27:34.790 --> 27:36.330
being held for arms dealing
by Europol.

27:36.530 --> 27:37.730
Now we get to it.

27:37.920 --> 27:40.340
- Grigoriy has two years left
of his sentence.

27:40.540 --> 27:43.600

27:43.800 --> 27:45.600

to his sentence.

27:52.290 --> 27:53.750

27:56.370 --> 28:00.310
If Grigoriy gets released...

28:31.590 --> 28:33.350
That was Jay Ackerman
from State.

28:33.550 --> 28:35.040
Alva was telling the truth.

28:35.240 --> 28:37.870
The Austrian Justice Ministry
sent us their reports.

28:38.070 --> 28:39.530
- All right, anything?
- Yep.

28:39.730 --> 28:41.660
Alva's received
plenty of offers, threats,

28:41.860 --> 28:43.050
and attempts
to shake him down,

28:43.250 --> 28:44.180
but one jumps out.

28:44.380 --> 28:45.790
Leon Oliver.

28:45.990 --> 28:47.620
There's emails and threats
from this man

28:47.820 --> 28:49.320
because
Alva would not take bribes

28:49.520 --> 28:52.230
and grant construction
contracts like his predecessor.

28:52.430 --> 28:53.500
Then two days ago,
Leon's communication with him

28:53.700 --> 28:55.020
just stopped abruptly.

28:55.220 --> 28:57.110
- Same day
Nicolette was attacked.

28:57.310 --> 28:59.810

an Austrian trade union boss

29:00.010 --> 29:01.460

29:07.270 --> 29:09.080

29:09.280 --> 29:10.600
And when Leon went to court,
the charges were

29:10.800 --> 29:12.860

due to lack of evidence

29:13.060 --> 29:14.780

recanting their testimony.

29:14.980 --> 29:16.870

or site?

29:19.030 --> 29:20.130
Working on it.

29:20.330 --> 29:22.260

what he wants from Alva,

29:22.460 --> 29:25.370
so he attacks Nicolette
as retribution?

29:28.850 --> 29:31.190
- Leon had
an ongoing relationship

29:31.390 --> 29:32.580

29:32.780 --> 29:34.670
