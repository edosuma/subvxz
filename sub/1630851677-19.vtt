WEBVTT

00:10.401 --> 00:12.273
- Go faster.- I'm trying.

00:12.403 --> 00:13.404
- Please.- I'm trying.

00:13.535 --> 00:14.971
I can't see.Faster.

00:15.145 --> 00:17.408
They're coming.

00:17.539 --> 00:18.409
Please, God, help us.

00:18.540 --> 00:20.324
Go, go.

00:23.110 --> 00:23.849
They must be tracking
your phone.

00:24.024 --> 00:24.676
Hand me that chair.

00:27.375 --> 00:28.767
Hey.

00:29.899 --> 00:32.771
I'll hold the door.Go. Now!

00:34.251 --> 00:35.209
Go!

00:39.691 --> 00:40.605
Don't trust anybody.

00:42.085 --> 00:43.478
They got people everywhere.

00:58.145 --> 00:59.624
Do you believe in the devil?

01:05.369 --> 01:08.111
Come on, come on.

01:10.070 --> 01:10.722
Come on, come on.

01:44.843 --> 01:46.410
It's about time.

01:46.584 --> 01:48.934
Whoa.
It's58.

01:49.065 --> 01:50.719
We are officially
two minutes early.

01:50.849 --> 01:51.937
Yeah, which by my account

01:52.068 --> 01:53.330
makes you 13 minutes late.

01:53.504 --> 01:54.984
Listen, you are
preaching to the choir.

01:55.158 --> 01:56.594
I love to be early
for everything,

01:56.768 --> 01:59.162
but I also have the opportunity

01:59.293 --> 02:01.251
to, uh, carpool
with a human being

02:01.425 --> 02:03.123
that has the clock management
skills of a tree sloth.

02:03.297 --> 02:04.994
Ah.What?

02:05.168 --> 02:06.387
Oh, excuse me
if I like to have

02:06.561 --> 02:08.780
a mindful breakfast
instead of sucking down

02:08.954 --> 02:11.783
a jack-juice man-shake
like a couple of Neanderthals.

02:11.957 --> 02:13.002
Wow, "man-shake."

02:13.176 --> 02:15.309
What is this?

02:15.483 --> 02:17.833
This is why Hetty made you
an investigator.

02:18.007 --> 02:20.444
Ouch, yet acutely accurate.

02:20.618 --> 02:22.272
It's from Beale.

02:22.446 --> 02:23.621
Wonder if it's
a Dear John letter.

02:23.795 --> 02:24.666
You think he found out about us?

02:24.840 --> 02:25.797
Huh.

02:25.971 --> 02:27.103
It says "Do not open

02:27.234 --> 02:28.844
until everybody is present."

02:29.018 --> 02:30.150
Yeah, which is why
we've been sitting here

02:30.324 --> 02:31.542
for the last 14 minutes
waiting for you

02:31.673 --> 02:32.239
to grace us
with your presence.

02:32.413 --> 02:33.240
Grace us?

02:33.414 --> 02:34.850
Who's us?

02:35.024 --> 02:36.504
You got a special friend
we don't know about?

02:36.678 --> 02:38.070
You got Snuffleupagus back there
making coffee?

02:38.245 --> 02:38.593
I think he means me.Whoa.

02:40.421 --> 02:41.900
And my man-shake.

02:42.031 --> 02:43.163
Wow, I did not see you there.

02:43.337 --> 02:44.816
More importantly,

02:44.990 --> 02:45.817
I didn't even know there
were desks over there.

02:45.991 --> 02:47.341
A detective

02:47.471 --> 02:49.299
at the height of his powers.Okay.

02:49.473 --> 02:50.213
Okay, this is-- we're definitely
close enough to a quorum.

02:50.387 --> 02:51.258
Let's open them.

02:51.432 --> 02:52.346
Here we go.All right.

02:54.391 --> 02:55.262
Oh, my God.

02:55.436 --> 02:57.046
$10,000?
What?

02:57.220 --> 02:59.962
Beale wrote me
a check for $10,000?

03:00.136 --> 03:02.356
He says, "In Silicon Valley,

03:02.530 --> 03:05.054
"we are all drowning in data
that we parade as knowledge,

03:05.228 --> 03:06.664
"power's confused
with respect,

03:06.838 --> 03:07.796
and success with happiness."

03:07.970 --> 03:09.493
"I miss you guys,

03:09.667 --> 03:11.060
"and by sharing my wealth,
I hope this brings us both

03:11.234 --> 03:12.801
happiness.
Your friend, Eric Beale."

03:12.931 --> 03:15.673
Wow.
Maybe he was inspired by Gibbs.

03:15.804 --> 03:16.848
"I've also donated the
same amount to each one of

03:17.022 --> 03:18.372
"your favorite charities,

03:18.546 --> 03:20.025
"so the one stipulation
on this check

03:20.156 --> 03:21.244
is you must spend it.
You can't put it in the bank."

03:21.418 --> 03:22.245
Wow.

03:22.419 --> 03:24.029
No problem.

03:24.160 --> 03:25.857
The same amount to charities?

03:26.031 --> 03:28.251
He's like
a modern-day Robin Hood.

03:28.382 --> 03:29.513
Yeah, if the sheriff of
Nottingham is riding around

03:29.687 --> 03:31.689
on a Segway, talking Klingon.

03:31.863 --> 03:33.256
Shoot, well, I'd
strap on those tight tights

03:33.430 --> 03:35.389
and be his merry man
for $10K.

03:35.519 --> 03:38.522
Well, let's just
mark that down

03:38.696 --> 03:42.396
to the ever-burgeoning list
of things I can't unsee.

03:42.526 --> 03:44.398
When the, uh,

03:44.528 --> 03:46.530
Make-A-Wish fever dies down,
get up to Ops.

03:46.704 --> 03:47.749
You have a case.

03:47.923 --> 03:49.316
Admiral, you get a check?

03:49.490 --> 03:51.318
I did, indeed, Mr. Deeks,

03:51.492 --> 03:52.449
and I have
already ordered

03:52.623 --> 03:54.277
the noise-canceling headphones

03:54.451 --> 03:57.324
and the soundproof glass
for my office.

03:57.498 --> 03:58.977
Impending happiness.

04:02.764 --> 04:04.026
You should head down
to your desk.

04:04.200 --> 04:05.070
You got a, uh...

04:05.245 --> 04:06.681
Check for $10,000?

04:06.855 --> 04:08.552
I know, I was just
doomscrolling on Etsy

04:08.726 --> 04:12.513
until we got
a very special guest.

04:12.687 --> 04:13.905
So, what happened to waiting
for everyone?

04:14.079 --> 04:14.906
God bless millennials.

04:16.430 --> 04:17.257
So, who's the special guest?

04:17.431 --> 04:18.823
Patching you through now.

04:20.303 --> 04:21.348
You got the team.

04:21.522 --> 04:23.132
Good morning, Avengers.

04:23.306 --> 04:24.699
Talia Del Campo.

04:24.873 --> 04:26.657
Good to see you.

04:26.831 --> 04:27.571
Wish I were there in person
to give you each muffins

04:27.745 --> 04:28.572
with extra gluten.

04:28.746 --> 04:31.096
Maybe give Deeks a long

04:31.271 --> 04:33.795
and questionably
inappropriate hug.

04:33.925 --> 04:35.231
Yes, please.

04:35.362 --> 04:36.928
I mean, no, thank y...
Rain check.

04:37.102 --> 04:38.626
What?
How you doing, Talia?

04:38.800 --> 04:40.454
Hey, Kens.

04:40.584 --> 04:42.412
I was great 24 hours ago,

04:42.586 --> 04:44.327
and then we lost contact
with one of our agents

04:44.501 --> 04:45.763
who was helping
transport a whistleblower

04:45.937 --> 04:47.635
for the Mexican government.

04:47.809 --> 04:49.506
Unfortunately, the LAPD
found him two hours later.

04:52.509 --> 04:53.293
Sorry for your loss.

04:53.467 --> 04:54.772
Thank you, Sam.

04:54.946 --> 04:56.252
Now the whistleblower's
on the run,

04:56.426 --> 04:57.906
and we have no way
of contacting him.

04:58.080 --> 04:59.299
Fatima.

05:00.561 --> 05:03.041
Martin Henderson,
served 20 years in the Navy.

05:03.215 --> 05:05.522
Worked his way up
to combat system weapons tech.

05:05.696 --> 05:07.132
He got out,
got a job working

05:07.307 --> 05:08.525
with Plutus Weaponry,

05:08.699 --> 05:10.005
where he's currently
in charge of

05:10.179 --> 05:11.354
distribution and sales
in the southwest.

05:11.528 --> 05:12.834
What'd he blow the whistle on?

05:13.008 --> 05:14.923
Straw buyers here in the U.S.

05:15.097 --> 05:17.142
are purchasing guns legally
and then helping smuggle them

05:17.273 --> 05:18.970
across the border
to cartel members in Mexico.

05:19.144 --> 05:20.755
Pop quiz,

05:20.929 --> 05:22.626
any of you know
how many guns are sold legally

05:22.800 --> 05:23.714
in all of Mexico?

05:23.845 --> 05:25.194
Mexico has

05:25.368 --> 05:26.151
one legal gun shop,
and they average

05:26.326 --> 05:28.284
just 10,000 guns a year.

05:28.458 --> 05:31.200
Cupcake for the new lady. Yes.

05:31.374 --> 05:32.723
But the Mexican government
believes

05:32.854 --> 05:36.161
over 250,000 guns are being
taken annually

05:36.292 --> 05:37.859
from the U.S. into Mexico.

05:38.033 --> 05:40.252
That explains why
most of the firearms found

05:40.427 --> 05:43.081
at the crime scenes in Mexico
trace back to the States.

05:43.212 --> 05:45.083
Exactly, you all know this,

05:45.214 --> 05:47.738
ATF knows, DEA knows.

05:47.912 --> 05:49.827
I'm sure my grandma's bridge
club in Bakersfield knows.

05:50.001 --> 05:51.873
Why aren't we doing anything
about it?

05:52.047 --> 05:54.223
That is the $64,000 question.

05:54.397 --> 05:56.443
You got any guesses,
my little Norwegian weasel?

05:56.617 --> 05:59.663
Oh, wow.
Uh, political gridlock?

05:59.837 --> 06:01.535
Wrong. This is actually one of

06:01.709 --> 06:03.754
the very few issues that
the vast majority of Americans

06:03.885 --> 06:05.713
and politicians agree.

06:05.887 --> 06:08.977
Red and blue, north and south,
sea to shining sea.

06:09.151 --> 06:10.457
No one wants American guns

06:10.631 --> 06:12.023
in the hands of
foreign criminals.

06:12.197 --> 06:13.547
Exactly, so now
the Mexican government

06:13.677 --> 06:16.245
has taken matters
into their own hands.

06:16.419 --> 06:18.029
They just filed a lawsuit
against the gun manufacturers

06:18.203 --> 06:20.858
for targeting cartel members
in their marketing campaigns.

06:21.032 --> 06:22.251
Marketing angle.

06:22.425 --> 06:23.905
Like the victims' families
in Sandy Hook.

06:24.079 --> 06:26.124
Yeah, I followed that case.

06:26.298 --> 06:28.126
They sued the gun manufacturer,
alleging it targeted younger,

06:28.300 --> 06:30.346
at-risk males in marketing
and product placement.

06:30.477 --> 06:33.480
And they won
a $73 million settlement.

06:33.654 --> 06:35.133
Now the Mexican government is
using that as a road map

06:35.264 --> 06:37.005
for their own litigation.

06:37.135 --> 06:38.702
Martin Henderson was
supposed to testify

06:38.876 --> 06:40.356
on behalf of
the Mexican government

06:40.530 --> 06:42.445
in front of a closed-door
congressional committee.

06:42.619 --> 06:44.665
Wow. That's a dangerous
whistle to blow.

06:44.839 --> 06:46.449
This is why we have an agent

06:46.623 --> 06:47.624
who got his head severed
and thrown

06:47.798 --> 06:49.496
eight stories off a building.

06:49.670 --> 06:51.715
I've got two addresses
of interest on your phones.

06:51.889 --> 06:53.195
I touch down in 30.

06:54.065 --> 06:55.632
The clock is ticking.

06:55.806 --> 06:57.286
If they find Martin
before we do,

06:57.460 --> 06:59.070
he's gonna end up
in six different body bags.

07:09.124 --> 07:10.952
All right, Fatima,
what do we know?

07:11.126 --> 07:12.606
Not much. His family hasn't
heard from him,

07:12.780 --> 07:14.825
neither has anybody
from the DEA's office.

07:14.956 --> 07:16.610
These two addresses are
our only leads.

07:19.047 --> 07:20.091
Okay, we're almost there.
Talk us in.

07:20.265 --> 07:21.702
Okay, so,
on your phones should be

07:21.832 --> 07:24.748
a photo of Martin's boss
Carlyle Huntington.

07:24.922 --> 07:27.272
Owner of Plutus Weaponry.
No priors. No nothing.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.100
He is squeaky clean on paper.

07:29.274 --> 07:31.320
Wow. Hard swipe right.

07:31.494 --> 07:32.539
Yeah, and according
to his tax records

07:32.713 --> 07:34.497
he's been making,
like, pro athlete money

07:34.671 --> 07:36.543
for the last three decades,

07:36.717 --> 07:38.414
and he's got the assets
to prove it.

07:38.588 --> 07:39.328
He's got a house in L.A.,
Manhattan,

07:39.502 --> 07:41.286
a ranch house in New Mexico,

07:41.417 --> 07:43.114
and a penthouse in Mexico City.

07:43.288 --> 07:44.855
Kaleidoscope caught him

07:44.986 --> 07:46.509
pulling into
La Bocca Felice valet

07:46.683 --> 07:47.902
about an hour ago.

07:48.076 --> 07:49.556
Wow.
Enjoy that beautiful brunch.

07:49.730 --> 07:51.209
What about us?
Did we lose a bet?

07:51.383 --> 07:52.472
Why are we going to Lancaster?

07:52.646 --> 07:53.690
That was the last thing
Martin texted

07:53.864 --> 07:55.866
before going off-line.

07:56.040 --> 07:57.912
According to sat images,
it looks like a ranch house

07:58.086 --> 07:59.348
under remodel.

07:59.522 --> 08:00.349
We have no idea
what's out there,

08:00.523 --> 08:01.263
so be careful,
watch your six.

08:01.437 --> 08:02.569
Got it.

08:07.574 --> 08:09.880
So, you want to talk about
how we're spending this $20K?

08:10.054 --> 08:11.665
Mm, I was thinking maybe
put it back into the house.

08:11.839 --> 08:13.884
You know, turn the garage
into a staycation paradise.

08:14.015 --> 08:16.974
Oh, please, God, tell me more.Mm-hmm. Pool table.

08:17.148 --> 08:17.975
All right.

08:18.149 --> 08:18.976
Flat-screen TVs.What?

08:19.150 --> 08:20.543
Mini fridge.Huh?

08:20.717 --> 08:22.327
And a golden shark.

08:22.458 --> 08:23.764
You are...

08:23.938 --> 08:25.896
a cruel and heartless
cross-eyed guttersnipe.

08:27.463 --> 08:28.464
That's just not even cool.

08:28.638 --> 08:29.334
I'm sorry.What?

08:29.509 --> 08:31.336
There was this moment,

08:31.467 --> 08:33.382
a flicker and joy
in your eyes,

08:33.556 --> 08:35.602
and then it all drained away.

08:35.776 --> 08:37.386
Yeah, because I thought
you were serious

08:37.560 --> 08:39.736
until you mentioned
my beloved golden shark.

08:39.910 --> 08:41.521
I'm ser-- What are we--
For real, though.

08:41.695 --> 08:43.131
I don't know, for real.

08:43.261 --> 08:43.958
I haven't had a chance
to think about it.

08:44.132 --> 08:45.133
Why? What about you?

08:45.263 --> 08:46.917
I was thinking like a sat phone,

08:47.048 --> 08:48.049
iPad,
maybe some monogrammed towels.

08:48.179 --> 08:49.790
You know...

08:49.964 --> 08:51.574
I'm pretty sure
you already have those things.

08:51.748 --> 08:54.055
Not for us,
I mean for, you know,

08:54.185 --> 08:55.578
Pilar. Rosa.

08:55.752 --> 08:56.579
What?

08:58.233 --> 09:00.061
Or not. I just, I was,
I was reading,

09:00.235 --> 09:01.628
and this article said that
of the most important things

09:01.802 --> 09:04.456
about adopting a teen
from a foreign country--

09:04.631 --> 09:06.284
obviously,
you have to make them feel safe

09:06.458 --> 09:07.547
and accepted and loved.Mm-hmm. Right.

09:07.721 --> 09:09.026
But also to give them
the opportunity

09:09.200 --> 09:11.202
to keep in contact
with their extended family

09:11.376 --> 09:12.595
from where they're from, so...

09:12.769 --> 09:14.728
Sat phone.

09:16.033 --> 09:17.426
What?

09:17.600 --> 09:18.993
I love you.
That's really thoughtful.

09:19.167 --> 09:19.950
You're thoughtful.

09:21.604 --> 09:22.649
But now that you mentioned
that beloved golden shark,

09:22.823 --> 09:24.607
maybe we just get
a pinball machine.

09:24.738 --> 09:25.608
Yeah, you should stop
while you're ahead.

09:25.782 --> 09:26.522
We can get a foosball.Oh, my gosh.

09:26.653 --> 09:27.958
Are you still talking?

09:28.132 --> 09:29.786
Sorry.

09:32.528 --> 09:34.225
Federal agents.
Keep it running.

09:41.058 --> 09:41.842
Bingo.

09:50.198 --> 09:51.765
Federal agents.
We just want to speak to...

10:00.425 --> 10:01.644
Got to be kidding me.

10:01.818 --> 10:03.603
Fatima, we're gonna need LAPD
down here.

10:03.777 --> 10:05.039
FATIMA
Copy that.

10:08.695 --> 10:11.436
Wow, espresso martini
at00 a.m.

10:11.567 --> 10:13.787
Well, I don't do coke anymore.

10:13.917 --> 10:15.092
Yeah?

10:15.266 --> 10:16.006
Carlyle Huntington?

10:16.180 --> 10:17.355
Yeah.

10:17.486 --> 10:19.183
Special Agent Sam Hanna.

10:19.357 --> 10:20.924
Of course you are.

10:21.098 --> 10:22.752
We need you to come with us.

10:22.926 --> 10:24.711
Security detail had
a little lapse in judgment,

10:24.885 --> 10:26.800
earned themselves
a trip back to college.

10:28.584 --> 10:30.020
I've never seen those men
before.
Okay.

10:30.194 --> 10:31.456
Sure you haven't.

10:31.631 --> 10:33.154
But now that breakfast is over

10:33.328 --> 10:34.503
and my pre-lunch sex
has vanished...

10:34.677 --> 10:35.722
Hmm.

10:35.896 --> 10:37.462
...let's go see

10:37.593 --> 10:39.377
how poorly
our tax dollars are spent.

10:39.551 --> 10:40.204
Yeah, let's do that.

10:42.859 --> 10:44.034
I fully understand

10:44.165 --> 10:46.602
the circumstances
and the protocol,

10:46.776 --> 10:49.518
but why didn't anyone get
written testimony

10:49.692 --> 10:51.172
to put before the committee?

10:52.782 --> 10:54.262
Well, anything is better
than nothing,

10:54.392 --> 10:57.439
and nothing is the scenario
we're teetering into.

10:59.180 --> 11:02.052
This man dies
and the whole thing falls apart.

11:02.183 --> 11:04.707
No, no, I'm not saying
I agree with him,

11:04.838 --> 11:06.187
but I do believe
in the fundamental right

11:06.361 --> 11:07.318
for this man to be heard.

11:10.495 --> 11:12.323
I'll keep you apprised.

11:26.120 --> 11:27.643
I'm not even sure
why we say it.

11:27.774 --> 11:29.601
What? "Federal agents"?Yeah.

11:29.776 --> 11:31.821
It's like a cue for bad guys
to run away or start shooting.

11:31.995 --> 11:33.823
Huh.
Maybe we should yell
"Jonas Brothers."

11:33.997 --> 11:37.000
Everybody would be super
excited to see a Jonas Brother.

11:37.174 --> 11:39.786
Federal agents.
Search warrant.

11:39.960 --> 11:41.309
Because if we don't,
we're the bad guys

11:41.439 --> 11:43.833
kicking in doors
in three, two...

11:52.886 --> 11:53.713
Clear.

11:55.323 --> 11:56.454
Clear.

11:58.543 --> 12:00.241
Well, it seems like we've been
sent on a wild goose chase.

12:03.679 --> 12:04.593
Hey, Fatima, what's up?

12:04.767 --> 12:05.725
Uh, guys.

12:05.899 --> 12:07.248
I'm looking at footage of you

12:07.422 --> 12:08.640
pulling up to the house.

12:08.815 --> 12:09.946
Footage? How?
We just got here.

12:10.120 --> 12:11.643
Yeah, we had a video sent

12:11.818 --> 12:12.775
to our content manager
for Threat Management.

12:12.949 --> 12:14.037
I'm looking at footage

12:14.211 --> 12:16.213
of you getting out
of Deeks's truck.

12:16.387 --> 12:18.128
You want backup?There isn't time.

12:18.259 --> 12:19.956
We're in fricking Egypt.

12:20.130 --> 12:21.828
What angle was
the footage taken from?

12:22.002 --> 12:23.699
Is it just
a hacked surveillance camera?

12:23.873 --> 12:25.309
No, looks like it's from
the south, across the street.

12:25.483 --> 12:27.877
Oh, my God.

12:28.051 --> 12:30.271
This video is only delayed,
like, 30 or 45 seconds.

12:30.445 --> 12:31.359
Guys, somebody's right
outside the house.

12:31.489 --> 12:33.056
Son of a bitch.

12:33.230 --> 12:35.624
Oh, man,
this is such a bummer.

12:35.798 --> 12:37.669
I really didn't plan
on bleeding today.

12:37.844 --> 12:38.627
Yeah, it would be
such a bummer

12:38.801 --> 12:40.063
to spend that $10K
on hospital bills.

12:40.237 --> 12:42.544
In three, two... Go.

12:44.024 --> 12:45.416
Guys?

12:45.590 --> 12:46.809
Where is everybody?

12:52.206 --> 12:54.425
Somebody wants us to know
we're being watched.

12:56.253 --> 12:58.560
Well, that's not, like,
foreboding at all.

13:10.006 --> 13:11.529
You know what's interesting?

13:11.703 --> 13:13.401
You didn't even ask us
why we brought you in.

13:13.531 --> 13:15.403
Let me do us both a favor

13:15.533 --> 13:17.971
and skip the part
where I act oblivious.

13:18.145 --> 13:19.581
Martin Henderson,
the head of my southwest sales

13:19.755 --> 13:21.017
and distribution, is missing.

13:21.191 --> 13:22.540
Okay.

13:22.671 --> 13:24.455
Any idea why he's missing?

13:24.629 --> 13:26.457
Maybe he has a second family
in Barstow.

13:26.631 --> 13:29.156
Oh.Try again.

13:29.330 --> 13:31.680
Rumor has it he's working
with the government.

13:31.854 --> 13:34.030
You two scaring off
my brunch with benefits

13:34.204 --> 13:36.076
kind of confirms that.

13:36.250 --> 13:38.121
We're just worried about him.Yeah. Me, too.

13:38.252 --> 13:40.341
Hmm.
Yeah.

13:40.515 --> 13:41.864
I imagine his ex-wife
and his two daughters

13:42.038 --> 13:43.648
are extremely distressed,

13:43.779 --> 13:46.477
except they haven't even
approached me.

13:46.651 --> 13:47.914
Now, I have
contacts all over,

13:48.088 --> 13:49.350
but they didn't ask me

13:49.524 --> 13:50.830
for help bringing him home.

13:51.004 --> 13:51.831
Why do you think that is?

13:53.528 --> 13:55.008
'Cause you can't photoshop
personality?

13:55.182 --> 13:57.140
Maybe.

13:57.314 --> 13:58.838
Or maybe it's because
he's working with the government

13:59.012 --> 14:00.448
against me and Plutus Weaponry.

14:01.841 --> 14:04.321
Why would he be doing that?

14:04.452 --> 14:06.454
Selling guns and ammunition
isn't for everybody.

14:06.584 --> 14:08.369
Maybe he became

14:08.543 --> 14:12.460
allergic to a steady income
stream and a robust 401.

14:12.590 --> 14:14.505
Hmm, or maybe he knew

14:14.679 --> 14:16.594
you and Plutus were knowingly
selling weapons to straw buyers,

14:16.725 --> 14:18.683
insuring a robust supply

14:18.814 --> 14:20.685
of weapons to the drug cartels.

14:20.816 --> 14:22.035
You can get a warrant,

14:22.165 --> 14:24.385
go through all the paperwork
in our office.

14:24.559 --> 14:27.170
We haven't broken
one single law.

14:27.344 --> 14:29.042
We are bulletproof.

14:29.172 --> 14:30.652
Pun intended.

14:30.826 --> 14:32.349
We'll see.

14:32.523 --> 14:33.829
ATF's at your office right now

14:33.960 --> 14:34.830
doing a spot compliance
inspection.

14:34.961 --> 14:36.701
Well, they better hurry.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.573
Why, you got an enema scheduled?

14:38.747 --> 14:40.270
That's-that's funny.

14:42.403 --> 14:46.624
I wasn't lying about not knowing
those guys at breakfast.

14:46.798 --> 14:48.409
If they're watching me,

14:48.583 --> 14:51.281
my guess is, they're already
way ahead of you.

14:51.412 --> 14:53.327
Who do you think they were?

14:53.501 --> 14:56.896
Gentlemen,
if we do legally sell weapons

14:57.070 --> 14:58.854
and they somehow

14:59.028 --> 15:00.987
illegally get smuggled
into Mexico,

15:01.161 --> 15:02.989
then I would imagine
the buyers in Mexico would do

15:03.163 --> 15:05.774
everything they can
to preserve that supply chain.

15:05.948 --> 15:08.603
People who have
a very different idea

15:08.777 --> 15:11.911
than us about
what's right or wrong.

15:12.085 --> 15:14.130
Okay. Okay.

15:19.614 --> 15:20.615
I don't like you.

15:20.789 --> 15:21.355
Well, the night is still young.

15:26.577 --> 15:27.709
I don't like him either.

15:27.883 --> 15:30.451
Yeah, but he's not wrong.

15:30.625 --> 15:32.801
Zero point sorting through
his paperwork like meatballs

15:32.975 --> 15:34.846
while Martin Henderson is
being hunted by the cartels.

15:35.021 --> 15:36.761
I might be able to help
with that.

15:36.892 --> 15:38.676
I've got red flag city.

15:38.850 --> 15:39.590
According to
these cross-referenced

15:39.764 --> 15:41.331
Plutus sales reports,

15:41.462 --> 15:42.898
we have one local address
in Culver

15:43.072 --> 15:44.987
attached to
over a hundred gun purchases

15:45.161 --> 15:46.771
from multiple buyers.

15:46.902 --> 15:48.643
Talia just landed.
She wants to go check it out

15:48.817 --> 15:50.906
and asked for
"a wingman to be her Goose."

15:51.037 --> 15:52.386
Who's Goose?

15:53.953 --> 15:55.171
Who's Goose?

15:56.825 --> 15:57.957
You-- Seriously?

15:58.131 --> 15:59.001
You never saw Top Gun?

15:59.175 --> 16:00.655
Of course he hasn't,

16:00.829 --> 16:03.266
unless it's in 30-second clips
on TikTok

16:03.440 --> 16:05.442
or they've remade it
with vampires. Go.

16:05.616 --> 16:06.704
Uh, meet Talia.

16:06.878 --> 16:08.010
I'll handle Carlyle.

16:08.184 --> 16:09.794
Oh, heads up.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.753
Goose ends up dead in Top Gun.

16:11.927 --> 16:13.407
Damn it.

16:13.581 --> 16:15.496
Care to join me?

16:15.670 --> 16:17.411
No, no, no, no.
Finish your proctology exam.

16:29.075 --> 16:30.511
Wow.

16:30.685 --> 16:33.862
Did the AARP special expire
at Denny's,

16:34.036 --> 16:34.950
or did I just get lucky
and arrive on

16:35.081 --> 16:36.430
Bring Grandpa to Work Day?

16:38.693 --> 16:40.825
You're right.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.349
I am 74.

16:43.959 --> 16:45.395
And I should be
living on a beach

16:45.526 --> 16:48.833
somewhere in Costa Rica,
making sweet time

16:48.964 --> 16:50.835
to a cask strength single malt

16:51.010 --> 16:52.663
and a cheap spy novel.

16:52.837 --> 16:56.624
But, instead,
I am stuck in L.A.,

16:56.754 --> 16:58.408
where ordinary
everyday outfits

16:58.539 --> 17:00.889
are Halloween costumes,

17:01.063 --> 17:02.891
and everyone reeks of kombucha

17:03.065 --> 17:04.893
and their parents'
disappointment.

17:05.067 --> 17:07.417
Where no one believes in God,

17:07.591 --> 17:10.377
but they will accept advice
from their hot yoga instructor.

17:13.206 --> 17:15.512
Looks like you should've
taken the red pill.

17:20.256 --> 17:23.259
We need help finding Martin.

17:24.782 --> 17:26.828
I need a name.

17:28.699 --> 17:30.658
Keyser S öze.

17:30.788 --> 17:31.833
That's clever.

17:32.007 --> 17:33.661
That is clever.

17:33.791 --> 17:35.576
How's that working out
for you, being clever?

17:35.750 --> 17:37.099
Yeah. Did you see
my brunch date?

17:37.273 --> 17:39.362
She's half my age, twice as hot.

17:43.105 --> 17:46.195
Martin Henderson is
being hunted by the cartels.

17:46.369 --> 17:48.110
Now, when they find him,
they will no doubt give him

17:48.284 --> 17:49.372
a Colombian Necktie.

17:49.546 --> 17:51.766
To clarify, that's when

17:51.940 --> 17:54.160
they cut his throat
and then pull his tongue down

17:54.334 --> 17:56.205
through the opening,
like a bloody necktie.

17:58.555 --> 18:01.689
Wonder if that would count
as, uh, business casual, huh?

18:04.735 --> 18:06.955
Now, I will ask
one more time.

18:07.129 --> 18:08.565
I need a name.

18:08.739 --> 18:09.175
Miguel Flores.

18:12.787 --> 18:15.050
I've seen jellyfish
fold slower.

18:17.618 --> 18:19.881
You know, I didn't have
you pegged as one of those...

18:20.055 --> 18:21.448
smug, anti-gun snowflakes.

18:26.017 --> 18:27.367
This isn't about politics.

18:27.541 --> 18:29.369
I have voted red since Coolidge.

18:29.543 --> 18:31.458
And it isn't about guns.

18:31.632 --> 18:34.113
I got more guns than you've
got empty bottles of Viagra.

18:35.157 --> 18:36.985
This is about people

18:37.159 --> 18:40.858
who choose financial gain
over human decency.

18:48.562 --> 18:50.738
Would've been faster if you'd
just started with that.

18:50.868 --> 18:52.566
I don't think I've done that
since BUD/S.

18:52.740 --> 18:53.871
You still got it.

18:54.002 --> 18:56.178
Yep, Miguel Flores,

18:56.309 --> 18:57.919
which was evidently
illegally coded as M. Flores

18:58.093 --> 18:59.747
on the distribution history.

18:59.877 --> 19:01.531
This guy fits the profile.

19:01.662 --> 19:03.881
He was born and raised in
the cartel hotbed of Reynosa.

19:04.055 --> 19:06.580
He became a U.S. citizen
after serving ten years

19:06.754 --> 19:08.147
in the Navy.

19:08.321 --> 19:10.540
And according to
the U.S. Customs database,

19:10.671 --> 19:12.151
he crosses the border
almost daily

19:12.325 --> 19:13.978
importing hand-painted tiles.

19:14.109 --> 19:15.980
Where do we find him?

19:16.111 --> 19:17.765
No brick and mortar address,

19:17.895 --> 19:20.159
but he's got a sailboat docked
surprisingly close to Sam's,

19:20.333 --> 19:22.683
and the DMV has him registered

19:22.857 --> 19:24.685
with a brand-new Raptor
and a 25k Ducati.

19:24.859 --> 19:26.774
On it.
Sorry, John Wick.

19:26.904 --> 19:28.341
We work in teams here.

19:28.471 --> 19:30.169
Take Fatima.

19:30.343 --> 19:31.605
And bring me back blood,

19:31.779 --> 19:33.476
answers or both.

19:33.650 --> 19:34.825
Preferably both.

19:34.999 --> 19:36.610
We're on it.

19:39.917 --> 19:41.571
Still cleared.

19:41.702 --> 19:43.138
What, are you getting paid
by the hour?

19:43.312 --> 19:44.444
You put this much hardware
on a garage,

19:44.618 --> 19:46.054
and you are just
screaming jackpot.

19:46.228 --> 19:47.838
You know what? Screw it.

19:48.012 --> 19:48.796
Crane kick, Daniel-san.

19:51.364 --> 19:52.321
One, two, three.

19:55.281 --> 19:57.326
Bingo.

19:57.500 --> 19:59.720
Fatima said Miguel Flores
has a fancy Raptor.

20:05.029 --> 20:06.553
And handmade Mexican tile.

20:06.727 --> 20:07.945
Mm-mm-mm.

20:08.076 --> 20:09.382
I'll call it in.

20:14.691 --> 20:16.432
Sorry, back in L.A.,
had to grab some In-N-Out.

20:16.606 --> 20:18.173
Oh, nice,
you get me anything?

20:18.347 --> 20:19.522
I was kidding, a man's life's
hanging in the balance.

20:19.696 --> 20:21.524
You think I'd grab
a pan-fried burger?

20:21.698 --> 20:23.309
What kind of sloppy jalopy
agent do you think I am?

20:23.483 --> 20:24.745
Sorry, I just...I'm just kidding.

20:24.919 --> 20:25.963
I got a Double-Double
in the car for you.

20:26.094 --> 20:27.922
For real?
God, no, man.

20:28.096 --> 20:29.750
What is this, your first day
on the job, Goose?

20:29.924 --> 20:31.404
Kick in those afterburners.

20:33.449 --> 20:35.277
Hi. I'm DEA Agent
Talia Del Campo.

20:35.451 --> 20:38.062
This is Special Agent
Squaretree.

20:38.193 --> 20:40.326
Rountree.Potatoes, Goose. Stay on topic.

20:40.500 --> 20:42.284
It's not potatoes,
it's my name.

20:42.458 --> 20:44.286
Sensitive is
the new masculine.

20:44.460 --> 20:46.027
Good for you.Also, for the record,

20:46.201 --> 20:47.550
I know Goose dies.

20:47.724 --> 20:49.335
Yes, he does.

20:49.509 --> 20:51.250
Because he prematurely ejected.

20:51.424 --> 20:52.425
Now, what is
the lesson we learn here?

20:52.555 --> 20:53.339
Can I help you?

20:54.905 --> 20:56.385
We've got a list of residents

20:56.559 --> 20:58.257
that bought over 100 guns
in the last six months.

20:58.431 --> 20:58.909
We'd like to see them,
please.

20:59.083 --> 21:01.260
Help yourself.

21:01.434 --> 21:03.218
And make sure you knock hard.

21:03.349 --> 21:05.568
After water aerobics
at00,

21:05.742 --> 21:08.005
this place is
like Cocoonmeets Burning Man.

21:09.311 --> 21:11.400
Could've lived
without that visual.

21:13.010 --> 21:14.795
Ooh.
Excuse me.

21:14.925 --> 21:16.536
Naughty grandpa.

21:16.710 --> 21:17.537
Come on.

21:18.973 --> 21:20.540
I'm just saying,
how you spend your money

21:20.714 --> 21:22.193
is an extension of our values.

21:22.368 --> 21:23.804
It's a window
into your priorities.

21:23.978 --> 21:25.936
Okay, so what would you
spend your $10K on?

21:26.110 --> 21:27.808
Well, something
that brings me happiness.

21:27.938 --> 21:29.940
A family vacation,

21:30.114 --> 21:32.595
down payment on Kam's car.

21:32.769 --> 21:35.032
So, as a millennial,
I should probably stop

21:35.206 --> 21:37.296
spending all my money
on useless tchotchkes from Etsy?

21:37.470 --> 21:39.428
Depends. Do they spark joy?

21:40.995 --> 21:42.692
Ah.

21:45.129 --> 21:47.131
Brand-new Ducati.

21:47.262 --> 21:49.046
Ooh. Maybe if we put
our checks together,

21:49.177 --> 21:50.787
we could, uh, split.

21:50.961 --> 21:52.528
Carpool like Harry and Lloyd.

21:52.702 --> 21:53.877
Yeah, maybe.
Miguel Flores?

21:55.618 --> 21:56.576
Special Agent Sam...

22:16.813 --> 22:17.684
Damn.

22:17.858 --> 22:19.860
Now, that...

22:20.034 --> 22:21.296
sparks joy.

22:22.645 --> 22:25.256
Well, the truck is
squeaky clean.

22:25.431 --> 22:25.996
I mean, is it possible
that he's just

22:26.170 --> 22:27.955
transporting Mexican tile?

22:28.085 --> 22:29.652
I mean, I'm not
in the import-export business,

22:29.826 --> 22:31.959
but I can't imagine
that Mexican tiles have margins

22:32.089 --> 22:34.875
big enough to afford new trucks
and fancy Italian motorcycles.

22:35.049 --> 22:37.399
Okay, well... Oh.

22:37.573 --> 22:38.705
Are we doing a remodel?

22:40.402 --> 22:41.751
God, I love demo day.

22:41.882 --> 22:43.405
What?

22:43.579 --> 22:45.799
You know, your boy Chip Gaines?
Shiplap?

22:45.973 --> 22:48.062
You watch Fixer Upper.No, I don't,

22:48.236 --> 22:49.542
but every time
I turn on the TV,

22:49.672 --> 22:52.196
it asks me if I want to
"continue to watch."

22:52.327 --> 22:53.894
Well, some guys sneak off
in the middle of the night

22:54.068 --> 22:55.330
to have affairs.

22:55.504 --> 22:57.201
I sneak off to watch
home repair shows.

22:57.332 --> 22:59.116
One, two... Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

22:59.247 --> 23:00.857
Mm, and house-shop on Zillow.

23:01.031 --> 23:02.903
Are you spying
on my browser history?

23:03.033 --> 23:04.644
No, not at all.

23:04.818 --> 23:06.950
"Two-bedroom bungalow in Kona"?

23:07.124 --> 23:08.212
Zillow is the new porn.

23:09.475 --> 23:10.867
Uh-huh.
Oh.

23:11.041 --> 23:12.478
Wh-- Do you need a light?

23:12.652 --> 23:14.436
What's going on?I got my phone.

23:14.567 --> 23:16.046
It's just not reading
with these fingers

23:16.220 --> 23:17.134
in these stupid gloves.Oh, my God.

23:17.308 --> 23:18.440
There we go. Oh, my God!

23:18.614 --> 23:20.311
Uh, Deeks, you okay? What...Fraggle Rock!

23:20.486 --> 23:21.530
Do you need something?

23:23.010 --> 23:24.620
Dead body.

23:24.794 --> 23:26.230
Oh, God!

23:26.361 --> 23:26.970
Oh! This never happened

23:27.144 --> 23:28.885
to Chip and Joanna.

23:29.059 --> 23:30.452
Looks like Miguel Flores is

23:30.626 --> 23:32.062
transporting more
than just Mexican tile.

23:32.236 --> 23:34.369
I hate demo day.

23:44.945 --> 23:45.815
You want to explain
why your truck was at a house

23:45.946 --> 23:47.600
with dead bodies stashed
in the attic?

23:47.730 --> 23:50.690
Man, you have no idea
who you're dealing with.

23:50.864 --> 23:52.082
I just drive tiles
back and forth.

23:52.256 --> 23:53.736
I don't ask questions.

23:53.910 --> 23:55.390
I don't even go into that house.

23:55.564 --> 23:56.609
Martin Henderson's on the run.

23:56.739 --> 23:58.393
And we both know
what's gonna happen

23:58.567 --> 23:59.525
if your employers find him
first.

23:59.699 --> 24:00.656
You know what happens
if they find out

24:00.830 --> 24:01.918
I even spoke to you?

24:02.092 --> 24:02.789
We can help you stay safe.

24:02.963 --> 24:03.964
Me?

24:04.094 --> 24:05.748
I'm...

24:05.922 --> 24:07.750
I'm a corpse walking.

24:07.924 --> 24:10.100
This ain't about me.

24:10.274 --> 24:12.494
My whole family is
back in Reynosa.

24:12.625 --> 24:15.062
My mom, my dad,
my two little brothers.

24:15.192 --> 24:16.498
My associates hear

24:16.672 --> 24:19.936
a whisper of this conversation,

24:20.067 --> 24:22.983
and my whole family ends up
in the bottom of a barrel.

24:26.508 --> 24:28.292
Seems we got an Annie Oakley
on our hands.

24:28.423 --> 24:29.859
Says here
Thelma Donstad purchased

24:29.990 --> 24:31.731
a pair of
.223-caliber Bushmasters

24:31.905 --> 24:33.733
for $1,100 a pop.

24:33.907 --> 24:35.909
Bushmaster? That can fire
rounds capable of

24:36.083 --> 24:37.911
piercing body armor.

24:38.085 --> 24:40.174
Must have been
a Cali-compliant model.

24:40.348 --> 24:42.089
Regardless, she's moving
military grade firepower.

24:42.263 --> 24:43.743
Ah.
Ah.

24:45.440 --> 24:47.529
Federal agents.

24:47.660 --> 24:48.356
I bet you she's got
an eye patch.

24:51.446 --> 24:52.665
Good morning.Good morning.

24:52.795 --> 24:54.754
I'm DEA Agent Talia Del Campo.

24:54.928 --> 24:57.452
This is
Special Agent Rounleaf.

24:57.583 --> 24:58.497
Do you have a moment?

24:58.671 --> 24:59.889
Come in.

25:00.020 --> 25:01.282
Thank you.

25:05.808 --> 25:06.548
We just wanted to ask you
some questions

25:06.722 --> 25:07.462
about some guns
you've purchased.

25:07.593 --> 25:09.246
Who, uh, has them now?

25:09.377 --> 25:10.378
I have them here.

25:11.684 --> 25:13.773
I'm sorry. You have them here?

25:13.947 --> 25:15.252
Of course. Got to keep
the good stuff close.

25:15.383 --> 25:16.340
You want to see them?

25:17.733 --> 25:19.343
Yeah.Yes. We'd love to. Thank you.

25:27.961 --> 25:30.703
Don't want to get them
scratched.

25:30.877 --> 25:32.269
Yeah, smart, but...

25:35.185 --> 25:36.099
The .22 pump action was

25:36.273 --> 25:38.275
my late husband Curt's.

25:38.449 --> 25:39.973
He wasn't as good a shot as me,

25:40.147 --> 25:42.279
but not many people were
back then.

25:42.453 --> 25:45.413
Uh, what about the twin .223s?

25:45.587 --> 25:47.371
I don't have any other guns.

25:47.502 --> 25:48.938
These are the only ones I own.

25:49.069 --> 25:52.376
I'm sorry, you didn't purchase
two Bushmaster .223s

25:52.507 --> 25:53.334
connected to a Napa address

25:53.508 --> 25:55.336
in December?Never heard of them.

25:56.729 --> 25:58.339
Do you have an ID showing
the Napa address?

25:58.513 --> 26:00.167
I do.

26:00.297 --> 26:02.169
But because of a theft
last year,

26:02.343 --> 26:04.301
the front office holds all
of our IDs to keep them safe.

26:04.475 --> 26:06.042
The front office?Yeah.

26:06.216 --> 26:07.653
Loretta can help you.

26:07.827 --> 26:08.958
She's the one that
collected them all.

26:09.089 --> 26:10.090
Loretta. Excuse us.

26:10.264 --> 26:11.526
Thank you.

26:13.049 --> 26:14.094
Happy hunting.

26:14.224 --> 26:16.662
Loretta.

26:21.275 --> 26:22.363
Oh, my God. We need
an ambulance right now.

26:22.537 --> 26:23.233
Copy that, Agent Rountree.

26:24.757 --> 26:25.801
Son of a bitch.

26:29.239 --> 26:31.111
Agent Castor.

26:31.241 --> 26:32.852
This is Isabella Cruz,

26:33.026 --> 26:36.072
Carlyle's fancy lawyer.Yeah.

26:36.203 --> 26:38.727
I got an alert that the human
tapeworm had arrived.

26:38.901 --> 26:41.121
I'm sorry that due process
is proving

26:41.295 --> 26:42.775
so cumbersome
to your witch hunt.

26:42.905 --> 26:45.604
Your client is obstructing
this investigation

26:45.778 --> 26:48.302
and withholding
crucial information.

26:48.476 --> 26:50.565
My client has a flight
back to New Mexico at00,

26:50.739 --> 26:52.219
so let's wrap
this charade up quick.

26:52.349 --> 26:54.830
His employee is being chased
by the cartels.

26:55.004 --> 26:57.572
God forbid he misses his flight.

26:57.746 --> 26:59.269
Oh, he won't miss the flight.

26:59.443 --> 27:00.880
It's a private jet.

27:01.054 --> 27:02.925
I just don't want
the sushi to spoil.

27:08.278 --> 27:10.454
God, I love L.A.

27:10.585 --> 27:11.064
So, what do we got?

27:11.238 --> 27:13.719
We're clear.

27:13.893 --> 27:15.677
So, you guys want the good news
or the bad news?

27:15.808 --> 27:17.244
Eh, good news.
Bad news.

27:17.374 --> 27:18.637
You sound like my parents.

27:18.811 --> 27:20.116
Wait, is that the good
or the bad?

27:20.290 --> 27:21.640
I'm going with her choice.

27:21.814 --> 27:23.163
Eh.The good news is,

27:23.337 --> 27:24.947
we found no explosives.

27:25.121 --> 27:26.819
What? That shouldn't count
as the good news.

27:26.993 --> 27:28.255
You already established that
when you said "clear."

27:28.385 --> 27:29.343
This is why I asked
for the bad news first.

27:29.517 --> 27:30.866
Damn it, what is the bad news?

27:31.040 --> 27:33.608
The bad news is, using our
subsurface scanning tech,

27:33.739 --> 27:36.132
we found something else.

27:36.263 --> 27:38.482
Well, this positively never
happened to Chip and Joanna.

27:38.657 --> 27:40.702
Hmm.
Whatever it is,

27:40.833 --> 27:42.530
it's throughout the whole house.Huh.

27:42.704 --> 27:44.227
Well, how do you think
that we should, um...

27:45.054 --> 27:46.099
Oh.

27:50.756 --> 27:52.192
And this is why
we don't have nice things.

27:55.891 --> 27:57.023
Ow!

28:03.986 --> 28:05.684
Ta-da!

28:05.858 --> 28:07.729
I love demo day.

28:07.903 --> 28:09.775
That's precisely what I said

28:09.949 --> 28:12.952
until I fell through the ceiling
with a corpse for an airbag.

28:14.518 --> 28:16.042
I think I broke a hoof.

28:19.436 --> 28:20.916
Tell me somebody has something.

28:21.090 --> 28:23.440
All out-of-state IDs
in Loretta's possession,

28:23.614 --> 28:24.441
they linked up with
the purchase of guns

28:24.572 --> 28:25.965
from Plutus's sales history.

28:26.139 --> 28:28.532
So, she's the straw buyer,

28:28.663 --> 28:30.621
using the residents' IDs
to buy weapons

28:30.796 --> 28:32.449
and then handing them off
to the cartel smugglers.

28:32.623 --> 28:33.581
Listen, even if we connect
these guns

28:33.755 --> 28:34.974
to the retirement home
and Loretta,

28:35.148 --> 28:36.366
it still doesn't give us
any evidence

28:36.540 --> 28:37.541
or leverage
against Plutus Weaponry.

28:37.716 --> 28:38.804
But who is behind

28:38.978 --> 28:40.240
completing all these 4473s

28:40.414 --> 28:41.632
and dealer records of sale?

28:41.807 --> 28:43.243
This isn't about finding
a guilty party.

28:43.417 --> 28:44.505
This is about Martin Henderson.

28:44.679 --> 28:46.594
We got to find this guy.

28:46.768 --> 28:47.813
He has all the answers, and
he's ready to tell the world.

28:47.987 --> 28:49.423
We just need to find him

28:49.597 --> 28:50.729
and give him
the opportunity to do that.

28:50.903 --> 28:52.208
Listen, Carlyle or Miguel,

28:52.382 --> 28:54.384
one of these guys has to
know something.

28:54.558 --> 28:55.951
Yeah, we got to dig deeper.

28:56.125 --> 28:58.649
Heart or hammer.

28:58.824 --> 28:59.389
But we got to get
under their skin

28:59.563 --> 29:00.521
and get 'em to break.

29:00.695 --> 29:02.479
Admiral, you know what to do.

29:02.653 --> 29:05.482
Little hand says "Tick,"
big hand says "Tock."

29:05.613 --> 29:07.397
Psyops time.

29:11.924 --> 29:13.926
You're right, you can go,

29:14.100 --> 29:14.753
'cause we don't have
enough to hold you.

29:14.927 --> 29:17.059
Told you, Gramps.

29:17.233 --> 29:20.019
Hey, have fun trying to find
your car in the parking lot.

29:20.193 --> 29:23.587
Must be fun being
on that side of the table,

29:23.718 --> 29:26.373
not to care about
anything but yourself.

29:26.503 --> 29:30.464
Sociopathic capitalist,
a narcissistic

29:30.638 --> 29:32.814
civilian parasite just sucking

29:32.945 --> 29:36.252
the blood from the dying carcass
of the American dream.

29:36.426 --> 29:37.210
We don't have to listen to this.

29:37.384 --> 29:38.733
Let's go.

29:38.864 --> 29:40.474
Wow, there it is.

29:40.648 --> 29:43.042
Sanctimonious
military hypocrisy.

29:43.172 --> 29:45.609
How high and mighty
you must feel, Captain,

29:45.740 --> 29:47.307
flying your moral authority

29:47.481 --> 29:48.221
under the banner
of American principles.

29:48.395 --> 29:50.658
Don't act like you

29:50.832 --> 29:52.529
and your people
don't have the blood

29:52.703 --> 29:54.531
of thousands of innocents
on your hands.

29:54.705 --> 29:56.969
At least we're
on the right side of history.

29:57.099 --> 29:57.883
Well, you're lying to yourself.

29:58.057 --> 29:59.275
This is a country

29:59.449 --> 30:00.973
born in genocide.

30:01.147 --> 30:02.757
There hasn't been a good war
since the Great War.

30:02.931 --> 30:04.585
So you know what?
Go ahead and dress up

30:04.759 --> 30:06.326
in your fancy
military blues,

30:06.500 --> 30:08.676
and act like
your kills are justified,

30:08.850 --> 30:11.418
but you are just another cog
in the war machine.

30:11.592 --> 30:13.550
I was a soldier,

30:13.724 --> 30:15.552
who fought for
your freedom to be a jackass.

30:17.424 --> 30:19.687
Well, here's the truth, soldier.

30:19.861 --> 30:21.907
Your American ideals
don't mean crap.

30:22.081 --> 30:24.083
You fight because
we want you to fight.

30:24.213 --> 30:27.216
And we want you to fight because
we make money when you do.

30:27.347 --> 30:29.305
Of course you do,
because you're a war profiteer

30:29.479 --> 30:31.351
who only manages

30:31.525 --> 30:33.440
to sleep at night because of
the illusion of the distance

30:33.570 --> 30:35.485
between you
and the bodies that fall.

30:35.659 --> 30:37.357
Says the man
who bombs children with drones

30:37.531 --> 30:38.967
and calls it diplomacy.

30:39.141 --> 30:40.142
What about
the 43 Mexican students

30:40.316 --> 30:42.275
on a bus going to a protest

30:42.449 --> 30:44.755
in the capital?
The cartels

30:44.930 --> 30:47.584
captured, tortured
and killed them all.

30:47.758 --> 30:48.890
That's just
population control.

30:49.064 --> 30:50.674
Less mouths to feed.

30:50.805 --> 30:52.154
Your dead mother in heaven
know what you've become?

30:52.328 --> 30:54.548
You watch your mouth.It's time to go.

30:54.722 --> 30:56.898
Nancy Huntington was
the secretary in the church

30:57.029 --> 30:58.552
and a middle school
music teacher.

30:58.726 --> 31:01.511
She dedicated her life to making
the world a better place.

31:01.685 --> 31:02.904
You don't know anything.

31:03.035 --> 31:05.037
I know that
she is weeping in heaven

31:05.167 --> 31:08.127
because what you are
is an abomination

31:08.257 --> 31:09.606
to what she was!None of this is my fault!

31:09.737 --> 31:11.652
None of it!

31:11.826 --> 31:14.133
Doesn't matter what I do!

31:14.307 --> 31:18.615
I could give you the name
of every-every straw buyer,

31:18.789 --> 31:20.487
every gun smuggler,
every cartel contact.

31:20.617 --> 31:22.054
And then what?

31:22.228 --> 31:24.186
You still have to remove
every dirty politician,

31:24.360 --> 31:25.884
every corrupt lobbyist,

31:26.058 --> 31:27.711
every judge.

31:27.842 --> 31:30.192
This is so much bigger
than anything you know.

31:30.366 --> 31:31.715
You think this is my lawyer?

31:31.890 --> 31:33.152
I didn't hire her.

31:34.762 --> 31:36.242
The system above me did.

31:36.416 --> 31:37.939
They brought her here
to keep the system safe!

31:38.113 --> 31:40.115
That's enough. Let's go.

31:40.289 --> 31:41.943
Where is Martin?

31:42.074 --> 31:43.336
You want know where he is?!I want to know now!

31:45.860 --> 31:47.079
On your knees! Castor!

31:49.385 --> 31:50.865
On your knees!
We've got an ambulance

31:50.996 --> 31:52.258
on the way. Fatima.

31:52.432 --> 31:54.173
Hang in there.

31:54.303 --> 31:56.305
Hang in there.
Stay with me. Stay with me.

31:59.004 --> 31:59.918
There was poison on that pen.
What was on there?

32:17.892 --> 32:18.675
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

32:18.806 --> 32:20.025
Excuse me. Come on.

32:20.199 --> 32:21.417
Huntington just got stabbed
in the neck

32:21.591 --> 32:22.549
by his attorney.

32:22.679 --> 32:24.333
They're tying
all loose ends.

32:25.682 --> 32:26.988
Help me find Martin.

32:27.162 --> 32:29.164
Help me save him.

32:29.338 --> 32:30.426
We'll protect your family.

32:30.600 --> 32:32.211
I promise you.We can send agents

32:32.385 --> 32:33.212
across the border right now.

32:33.386 --> 32:34.387
We'll bring them back here.

32:34.561 --> 32:35.997
We'll help them get asylum.

32:36.128 --> 32:37.956
You guys are living
in a fantasy world.

32:38.130 --> 32:39.783
They would be dead
before your agents

32:39.958 --> 32:41.350
touched the tarmac.

32:41.481 --> 32:42.786
You guys don't understand.I do understand.

32:42.917 --> 32:43.918
No, you don't understand.I do understand.

32:44.049 --> 32:47.008
I understand.

32:47.139 --> 32:49.358
I understand that you
probably don't remember a time

32:49.489 --> 32:50.316
you weren't working
for the cartel.

32:51.882 --> 32:53.884
That they take care
of your family,

32:54.059 --> 32:55.016
that they put food
on the table,

32:55.190 --> 32:56.713
that they helped you
cross the border.

32:56.887 --> 32:58.237
That they helped you
join the military,

32:58.367 --> 32:59.803
and through that
you got dual citizenship.

33:01.370 --> 33:03.155
That as conflicted
as you may feel about

33:03.285 --> 33:05.244
what you do for them,

33:05.374 --> 33:06.810
it doesn't matter
because they own you.

33:08.029 --> 33:10.336
I can't speak to that.

33:10.510 --> 33:12.251
Those sins are tied to
the circumstances of your birth.

33:12.425 --> 33:13.730
All I know is,

33:13.904 --> 33:17.038
right now you have the power

33:17.169 --> 33:19.301
to save an innocent man's life.

33:21.347 --> 33:23.436
And maybe, at the same time,
end the flow of weapons

33:23.610 --> 33:26.265
going into the hands
of the same monsters

33:26.439 --> 33:28.223
that own you and your family.

33:29.833 --> 33:30.965
Please.

33:44.892 --> 33:46.111
I need my phone.

33:46.285 --> 33:48.113
Yeah, here, here.
Here you go.

33:56.425 --> 33:57.992
Look.

33:58.123 --> 34:00.908
Usually, the hardest thing to do

34:01.082 --> 34:03.215
and the right thing to do...

34:04.694 --> 34:07.349
...are the same thing.

34:08.916 --> 34:10.135
You can do this.

34:25.933 --> 34:27.456
They found him.

34:27.587 --> 34:29.937
He's at a warehouse
in Culver. I'm sorry.

34:32.026 --> 34:32.635
I'm sorry, man.Thank you.

34:41.992 --> 34:44.125
We're five minutes out.
How far are Talia and Rountree?

34:44.256 --> 34:45.300
That's not rhetorical,

34:45.474 --> 34:46.649
Agent Rountree.

34:46.823 --> 34:47.955
We need a damned ETA.

34:48.129 --> 34:49.739
On the off chance we live,

34:49.913 --> 34:51.219
seven minutes out.

34:53.308 --> 34:54.353
What about Culver City PD?

34:54.527 --> 34:55.832
They got anybody in the area?

34:56.006 --> 34:57.095
They're ten out.

34:57.269 --> 34:58.879
And 911 dispatch just got a call

34:59.053 --> 35:00.924
there's a fire at that address.

35:01.055 --> 35:03.797
Do we have oxygen masks
or EEDs in our go bags?

35:03.971 --> 35:05.538
I wish. Budget cuts.

35:05.712 --> 35:07.583
That's the first thing
I'm spending my $10K on.

35:07.757 --> 35:08.584
Well, in the meantime,
you better start doing

35:08.758 --> 35:09.759
your Wim Hof breathing.

35:09.933 --> 35:10.630
Ha. That's funny.

35:12.849 --> 35:14.503
Wait, what?Sam, I've got
a full-face respirator.

35:14.634 --> 35:16.418
We're two minutes behind you.

35:16.592 --> 35:18.203
That's two minutes that
Martin Henderson might not have.

35:18.377 --> 35:20.292
Sam, save this man.

35:22.207 --> 35:23.295
We're here.

35:30.563 --> 35:31.694
Get down!

35:32.565 --> 35:34.306
Cover me!

35:42.792 --> 35:44.229
Did you want to wait
for the respirator?

36:17.087 --> 36:18.480
Drop it. On your knees.

36:20.090 --> 36:21.440
It's better to die standing.

36:21.614 --> 36:23.181
Shut up and drop it.

36:25.008 --> 36:26.358
Do you believe in the devil?

36:26.488 --> 36:27.794
I do.

36:37.586 --> 36:38.761
Tell him I say hello.

36:52.862 --> 36:54.690
Come on, go. Go, go, go.

36:54.864 --> 36:56.649
Get him. Get him, get him.
Get him.

36:56.823 --> 36:58.259
Pull him in. Pull him in.

36:58.390 --> 36:59.521
This man has to live.

37:02.742 --> 37:04.526
Yo, he was recording something.

37:04.700 --> 37:05.745
Come on. You go, I'll ride
with him to the hospital.

37:05.919 --> 37:06.876
Go, go, go, go, go.

37:08.226 --> 37:10.445
Let's go, move, move!
Go.

37:18.497 --> 37:19.498
My God.

37:19.672 --> 37:21.978
What are we gonna do?

37:22.109 --> 37:23.545
Send it in,

37:23.719 --> 37:25.330
pray it was worth the lives
of two good men.

37:29.595 --> 37:31.945
Yes, ma'am. I understand
that it can't be used

37:32.119 --> 37:33.207
as official testimony,

37:33.338 --> 37:34.904
but it certainly has
probative value.

37:37.690 --> 37:41.302
No, no, no. This goes
beyond partisan politics.

37:41.433 --> 37:44.479
We have a moral obligation
to put this man's dying message

37:44.653 --> 37:47.221
before that committee.

37:51.660 --> 37:53.140
I just got confirmation
from my agent,

37:53.314 --> 37:55.360
they pronounced him dead
in the ambulance.

37:59.059 --> 38:00.974
I understand.

38:01.148 --> 38:04.891
I will just bury it until I hear
back from the gods on Olympus.

38:09.461 --> 38:11.506
Evidently the soundproof
glass has not arrived.

38:11.680 --> 38:13.682
You were never here.

38:13.856 --> 38:16.119
You saw nothing.

38:17.773 --> 38:20.950
Said all murderers
right before they murdered.

38:23.213 --> 38:25.651
That's what I'd spend
my $10K on.

38:25.825 --> 38:28.828
Buy a time machine that
would take us back 12 hours.

38:29.002 --> 38:30.308
Great, so we could relive

38:30.482 --> 38:32.048
one of the worst days
on the job.

38:32.222 --> 38:34.224
No, babe,
so we could redo it.

38:34.399 --> 38:35.574
A little bit better,
a little bit faster

38:35.748 --> 38:37.271
so that Martin Henderson
would still be alive

38:37.445 --> 38:38.707
and his voice
could be heard.

38:40.492 --> 38:41.971
It'd be worth it just to not
ride that corpse-coaster

38:42.145 --> 38:43.103
through the ceiling.

38:46.541 --> 38:48.021
Huh?

38:48.195 --> 38:49.675
It's a video message
from a blocked number.

38:49.849 --> 38:51.067
I got the same one.It's to the whole office.

38:51.241 --> 38:52.330
There's like 200 numbers
on here.

38:52.504 --> 38:53.374
You want to throw it
on the big screen?

38:53.548 --> 38:54.462
Yeah.

38:57.204 --> 38:59.075
Oh, my God.

38:59.206 --> 39:00.990
For anybody listening to this,

39:01.164 --> 39:03.950
the Mexican government is right.

39:04.080 --> 39:07.083
These gun manufacturers
designed and marketed

39:07.257 --> 39:09.085
these guns at the cartels
by doing things

39:09.259 --> 39:12.219
like engraving quotes of famous
Mexican national heroes

39:12.393 --> 39:13.742
on the slide,

39:13.873 --> 39:15.527
and then distributing the guns
to us

39:15.701 --> 39:16.354
with the knowledge
that we would be selling them

39:16.528 --> 39:18.486
to a network of straw buyers,

39:18.660 --> 39:21.881
who would smuggle them
across the border.

39:22.055 --> 39:25.188
It's an orchestrated pipeline
to sell guns to cartel members.

39:25.363 --> 39:27.408
Believe me,

39:27.539 --> 39:29.889
I did not want to be
a whistleblower,

39:30.063 --> 39:33.066
but I can't look at another
picture of a burned corpse,

39:33.240 --> 39:34.763
or a bus of dead students,

39:34.894 --> 39:36.852
or bodies hanging off
the side of a bridge

39:36.983 --> 39:39.377
without acknowledging that
I played a role in this.

39:40.987 --> 39:43.642
I'm the son of a pastor
and a preschool teacher.

39:43.772 --> 39:46.384
I'm the father
of two beautiful girls.

39:46.558 --> 39:48.429
I spent 20 years in the Navy

39:48.603 --> 39:50.344
fighting for
this amazing country.

39:50.518 --> 39:51.824
But I've spent
the last ten years

39:51.998 --> 39:54.348
justifying my silence
in the face of something

39:54.479 --> 39:56.394
I knew was wrong.

39:56.568 --> 39:59.005
We all know that feeling.

39:59.135 --> 40:02.225
It's that cold, dull guilt

40:02.356 --> 40:03.575
that eats away at your soul

40:03.705 --> 40:06.142
when you try to fall asleep.

40:06.316 --> 40:07.840
Money doesn't set you free
from that.

40:09.232 --> 40:10.712
Only the truth does.

40:12.845 --> 40:15.717
Speak the truth
and the dawn will come.

40:18.546 --> 40:20.896
And to my-my two
beautiful girls,

40:21.070 --> 40:22.681
Zoe and Kristen,

40:22.855 --> 40:23.725
I'm so proud of you.

40:30.689 --> 40:33.387
And I love you so much.

40:33.561 --> 40:35.607
Do you believe in the devil?

41:06.855 --> 41:09.989
and TOYOTA.
