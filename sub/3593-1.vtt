             Uh huh.

00:19.710 --> 00:20.980
    Ok, well that sounds good.

00:24.620 --> 00:31.030
    I read the recommendation
        as well, but um...

00:31.130 --> 00:35.200
     there are other factors,
    like my gut, for instance.

00:35.300 --> 00:37.100
              Yeah.

00:37.200 --> 00:38.630
     You know, the truth is
     I can't help but wonder

00:38.730 --> 00:40.730
    if we're getting played.

00:40.840 --> 00:42.470

               Ok.

00:45.310 --> 00:48.780
  Well, sure I'll sleep on it.

00:48.880 --> 00:50.880
       But you should know
       I'm leaning towards

00:50.980 --> 00:53.110
       another six months
         of observation.

00:59.550 --> 01:01.660
         I'll see you at
       the panel tomorrow.

     to ask her to rehearse.

      Gifted children, they
  sometimes isolate themselves,

04:50.550 --> 04:52.290

       sometimes you don't
         see the signs.

      has lots of friends.

   She has her girls at church
       and her youth group

05:00.700 --> 05:04.100
   and she's always been very
mature, isn't that right, Dylan?

05:04.200 --> 05:06.030
        Yeah, our Sophia
        was born mature.

05:06.130 --> 05:07.070
          She's great.

       Since I was eight.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.730

   one of those Casio things.

08:56.830 --> 08:58.300

08:58.400 --> 09:00.770
 until finally she signed me up
          for lessons.

09:00.870 --> 09:03.240

        and not at home?

  I had a lot of ear infections
       when I was younger

09:16.680 --> 09:19.520

          be my thing.

       did you know that?

01:10:09.130 --> 01:10:10.970
               No.

01:10:11.070 --> 01:10:12.970
         She lives with
       her granddaughter.

01:10:13.070 --> 01:10:15.140
    Lorraine had a daughter?

01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:16.840
            Michelle.

01:10:20.510 --> 01:10:21.810
      Your friend Michelle?

01:10:21.910 --> 01:10:25.380
     Is Lorraine's daughter.

01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:26.780
      That's not possible.

01:10:28.550 --> 01:10:29.620
 We were done four years before.

01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:31.590
 Not if she lied about her age.

01:10:31.690 --> 01:10:34.490
 She's four years older than me.

01:10:34.590 --> 01:10:36.590
    She was institutionalized
     after her mother died.

01:10:36.690 --> 01:10:38.490
 Her grandmother is practically
          a vegetable.

01:10:42.270 --> 01:10:44.630
     You have to believe me.

01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:46.470
  All this time I had no idea.

01:10:50.570 --> 01:10:51.980
     You've gotta tell mom.

01:10:55.580 --> 01:10:57.080
      I know it's not easy,

01:10:57.180 --> 01:10:59.080
    but it's not fair keeping
         this from her.

01:10:59.180 --> 01:11:01.350
       She needs to know.

01:11:09.660 --> 01:11:12.360
      It was before we met.

01:11:12.460 --> 01:11:14.130
 I never knew she was pregnant.

01:11:14.230 --> 01:11:16.530
       I never even talked
          to her again.

01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:30.450
   We have to call the police.

01:11:30.550 --> 01:11:33.150
        Call the police?

01:11:33.250 --> 01:11:36.450
     Breaking and entering,
    destruction of property.

01:11:36.550 --> 01:11:39.090
     You think she's the one
  that broke into your office?

01:11:39.190 --> 01:11:42.590
   It can't be a coincidence.

01:11:42.690 --> 01:11:44.630
          Mom's right.

01:11:44.730 --> 01:11:46.030
    Michelle has been trying
      to get me in trouble

01:11:46.130 --> 01:11:47.860
    ever since she got here.

01:11:47.970 --> 01:11:51.530
    Sabotaging my schoolwork,
            my music.

01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:56.440
     She even took advantage
            of Alex.

01:11:56.540 --> 01:11:59.580
      I don't know how far
      she's willing to go.

01:12:03.580 --> 01:12:08.520
This detective gave me his card.

01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:11.390
      Fine, I'll call him.

01:12:18.330 --> 01:12:21.260
      Mom, he didn't know.

01:12:27.300 --> 01:12:29.270
 It doesn't make it any easier.

           hasn't been

01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:42.710
   in a healthy state of mind.

01:14:42.810 --> 01:14:44.740
     So all these incidents,
   they're connected with her?

01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:46.110
         It appears so.

01:14:46.210 --> 01:14:47.110
      Ok, so can you just-

01:14:47.210 --> 01:14:49.650
      how dangerous is she?

01:14:49.750 --> 01:14:52.780
   Even though she's unstable,
      her record is clean.

01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:55.650
   That being said, we're not
      taking this lightly.

01:14:57.090 --> 01:14:58.750
       we'll have a patrol
        car in the area.

 We've notified your high school
     of the situation, too.

  You don't know what it's like
 to be abandoned by your father.

01:18:31.170 --> 01:18:34.970

    drown herself in alcohol.
