00:02.670 --> 00:04.064
<i>With winds in the
60 mile-per-hour range...</i>

00:04.088 --> 00:06.081
<i>recommend everyone stay indoors...</i>

00:07.467 --> 00:10.337
Yo, TXU line worker,
struck by lightning.

00:10.512 --> 00:11.626
Knocked him 50 feet.

00:11.804 --> 00:13.762
BP's stable
but he's having runs of PVCs.

00:13.932 --> 00:15.046
Paul, you're with me.

00:15.225 --> 00:17.846
Get him on telemetry
and I need a twelve-lead EKG stat.

00:18.019 --> 00:20.012
Get him to the OR
and have a blood bank tech...

00:20.188 --> 00:22.180
- cross six units of A positive.
- On it.

00:22.357 --> 00:24.433
That sounded close.

00:24.609 --> 00:27.444
Good Lord, we got our own Sandy.

00:28.112 --> 00:29.192
That's from lightning?

00:29.364 --> 00:31.522
Broken capillaries from
the lightning current.

00:31.699 --> 00:33.739
Can last a couple of days.
Multifocal PVCs.

00:33.910 --> 00:37.279
Add a troponin and total-CK.
And push five of Metoprolol.

00:37.455 --> 00:39.827
Hey, Krista, check this out.

00:39.999 --> 00:41.624
- See those two white spots?
- Yeah.

00:41.793 --> 00:44.498
Teeth embedded in that dude's knuckles.
Can you top that?

00:44.671 --> 00:47.043
I just pulled a Yankee Candle
out of a guy's butt.

00:47.215 --> 00:49.967
- You win.
- I've got an x-ray you should see.

00:50.134 --> 00:51.379
- It's pretty juicy.
- Okay.

00:51.553 --> 00:53.759
I was thinking we could
look at them together.

00:53.930 --> 00:56.088
I might be kind of busy
but I'll let you know.

00:56.266 --> 00:58.554
You do not say a word
because I'm a nerd magnet.

00:58.726 --> 01:01.811
- I hate hurting their feelings.
- Nerds today, husbands tomorrow.

01:01.980 --> 01:04.815
In addition to having four
state-of-the-art trauma rooms...

01:04.983 --> 01:07.355
and a dedicated trauma
CAT scan machine.

01:07.527 --> 01:09.566
I gotta admit, I'm impressed.

01:09.737 --> 01:10.900
Dr. Scott Clemmens...

01:11.072 --> 01:14.192
Head of San Antonio Memorial
Trauma Department.

01:14.367 --> 01:19.574
- Has a certain ring to it, no?
- I appreciate the tour, but I'm deciding.

01:19.747 --> 01:21.491
It's a sweet deal, I'm telling you.

01:21.666 --> 01:24.122
Not the kind of opportunity
you will get in Dallas.

01:24.294 --> 01:26.785
I came to observe the night shift
for a few hours...

01:26.963 --> 01:29.419
but as far as
making any commitment...

01:29.591 --> 01:31.583
we still have some stuff
to figure out.

01:31.759 --> 01:34.048
What's to figure out?

01:34.220 --> 01:36.842
The two of you can stop this
whole long distance thing.

01:37.015 --> 01:40.549
Get settled in, pop out a couple
of monkeys and, boom, done.

01:40.727 --> 01:43.134
Mr. Ragosa, Dr. Richards
on the phone for you.

01:43.313 --> 01:46.397
Don't drag your feet, cowboy.
The board is waiting.

01:46.566 --> 01:48.108
They want a name.

01:48.276 --> 01:51.230
- That wasn't awkward.
- Yeah.

01:51.404 --> 01:53.776
Look, this would be
a huge move for me.

01:53.948 --> 01:56.522
I have to be sure it's one
that I wanna make.

01:56.826 --> 01:58.320
But he's right.

01:58.494 --> 02:00.534
- It would make our lives easier.
- It would.

02:00.705 --> 02:02.745
Hey, look, I have to be sure too,
you know?

02:02.916 --> 02:06.249
- Last time I lived with a guy...
- Yeah, it didn't work out too well.

02:06.419 --> 02:08.661
- But I'm not that guy.
- No. You are not.

02:08.838 --> 02:12.338
- Hey guys.
- Hey, Topher, you okay?

02:12.509 --> 02:14.750
Topher had surgery recently.
First night back.

02:14.928 --> 02:16.588
Don't ever get a vasectomy,
Scott.

02:16.763 --> 02:19.254
No man should ever feel
this kind of pain down there.

02:19.432 --> 02:22.801
Oh, Topher. Sorry, man.
It hurts just looking at you.

02:22.977 --> 02:24.685
Yeah, I can tell by your laughter.

02:24.854 --> 02:27.013
Ball pain is always funny
when it's not yours.

02:27.190 --> 02:30.440
Try to take it easy tonight.
Stick with the colds and flus, okay?

02:30.610 --> 02:32.318
Landry, you remember Scott, right?

02:32.487 --> 02:34.812
Yeah. I heard you were
taking over trauma.

02:34.989 --> 02:37.278
- Thinking about it.
- That should be interesting.

02:37.450 --> 02:40.024
So Jordan tells me
that you're seeing TC now.

02:40.203 --> 02:42.776
- Did she? Oh, boy.
- Repent!

02:42.956 --> 02:48.661
For I bring my wrath upon thee,
sinners. The end is nigh!

02:48.837 --> 02:51.374
- Mollie, prep the rubber room.
- Repent!

02:51.548 --> 02:54.632
Hey. That was tonight's
on-call trauma attending.

02:54.801 --> 02:57.636
Roads are wiped out
and we're already short three nurses...

02:57.804 --> 03:00.377
- because of closures.
- The storm's gonna slam us.

03:00.557 --> 03:03.760
Hey, guys. A tornado just tore
through the Sidewinder Trailer Park.

03:03.935 --> 03:06.852
Fire department is on the way.
Paramedics got in an accident.

03:07.021 --> 03:08.681
- Here we go. Okay, TC?
- Yeah.

03:08.857 --> 03:11.098
Take him for a chest x-ray. I'm on it.

03:11.276 --> 03:13.945
Topher, I'm afraid you
and your smushed man tonsils...

03:14.112 --> 03:16.982
- are gonna sit this one out.
- Again with the sensitivity.

03:17.156 --> 03:19.826
- T, Take Drew with you. Are you sure?
- I'll do it.

03:19.993 --> 03:22.365
I've done search and rescue
for five years.

03:22.537 --> 03:24.280
It's a good way to see this place.

03:24.455 --> 03:26.911
I love this can-do attitude. Okay.

03:27.083 --> 03:30.250
Listen up, everybody.
Dr. Clemmens hereby has privileges.

03:30.420 --> 03:31.451
Now get out of here.

03:31.629 --> 03:34.120
Just follow my lead
and don't get in my way.

03:34.299 --> 03:37.300
- I was gonna say the same to you.
- Look at that.

03:37.468 --> 03:40.754
The past and future,
right before your eyes.

03:40.930 --> 03:43.884
You shut up
or I'll smack you in your nuts.

03:45.000 --> 03:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:56.196 --> 03:58.947
We got a 32-year-old healthy female
with blunt trauma.

03:59.115 --> 04:00.313
Don't know the specifics.

04:00.491 --> 04:03.161
Not sending my men in
until the mobile unit's tied down.

04:03.328 --> 04:06.910
- Hey, we need another five.
- She might not have another five.

04:07.081 --> 04:09.489
Just follow me. Over here.
Let's go.

04:17.216 --> 04:18.711
Scott, help me with this.

04:21.012 --> 04:22.292
My daughter!

04:24.390 --> 04:26.549
- I got this.
- Right behind you.

04:27.310 --> 04:30.015
There she is. It's okay, ma'am,
we got this.

04:33.441 --> 04:38.186
It's okay, ma'am.
We're gonna get you out of here.

04:39.155 --> 04:40.982
It's gonna be okay.

04:41.157 --> 04:45.025
Abnormal breath sounds.
Possibly a collapsed lung.

04:48.581 --> 04:51.072
- Pulmonary hernia.
- The lung looks severely contused.

04:51.251 --> 04:53.243
- She needs the OR.
- Hand me an AB pad.

04:53.419 --> 04:56.124
I'm on it.
Get her on an O2 face mask.

05:01.553 --> 05:03.047
Move it along, guys.

05:03.221 --> 05:05.130
Don't wanna have
a second tragedy here.

05:05.306 --> 05:06.848
Get the rescue basket over here.

05:07.016 --> 05:09.175
- We can move her now.
- Let's go! Get in here!

05:09.352 --> 05:11.143
Need you to stay
as still as possible.

05:11.312 --> 05:13.471
We're gonna get you out of here.

05:15.233 --> 05:18.816
- Ma'am, what is it?
- My son, Ernie.

05:18.987 --> 05:21.228
He's over there.

05:23.908 --> 05:27.277
Okay, we have to move her.
Get her out of here now, okay? Go. Go.

05:27.453 --> 05:28.533
Okay, it's okay.

05:28.705 --> 05:30.744
We're gonna get you
and your son out.

05:30.915 --> 05:33.074
- Ernie? Ernie.
- Come on, we need that basket.

05:33.251 --> 05:35.576
- Ernie.
- Help.

05:37.505 --> 05:41.633
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, little guy.
It's okay. It's okay.

05:42.260 --> 05:43.458
It's pretty simple, Paul.

05:43.636 --> 05:47.136
Inject Lidocaine at the nail,
make a small incision, pull it out.

05:47.307 --> 05:49.050
- I can do that.
- All right.

05:49.225 --> 05:50.304
What do we got here?

05:50.476 --> 05:53.394
I was trying to film the storm
from my window and it blew in.

05:53.563 --> 05:55.187
That's a pretty bad laceration.

05:55.356 --> 05:57.515
We can sew that right back up.
Wanna prep him?

05:57.692 --> 05:59.815
- Yes.
- Hope you got some good footage.

05:59.986 --> 06:01.729
Mr. Ragosa?

06:07.827 --> 06:09.452
Son of a bitch.

06:17.170 --> 06:19.791
Okay, everybody. Take it easy.

06:21.424 --> 06:25.801
Our emergency generators
will come back on in three, two...

06:26.596 --> 06:29.087
Nothing to worry about.
We have four backup gennies.

06:29.265 --> 06:31.222
- Make that two.
- What?

06:31.684 --> 06:33.642
Budget cuts. Got it.

06:33.811 --> 06:36.516
There was an explosion
at the power transmission station.

06:36.689 --> 06:38.397
TXU says an open
line got ruptured.

06:38.566 --> 06:40.358
- How long until it's back?
- No answer.

06:40.527 --> 06:44.061
We have diesel for the gennies.
We need to re-prioritise to keep power.

06:44.239 --> 06:46.480
Mollie, turn off all
non-essential electronics.

06:46.658 --> 06:50.074
ICU gets the lion's share of the juice.
Please check on TC and Scott.

06:50.245 --> 06:52.368
- We need them back here.
- Okay, I'm on it.

06:53.623 --> 06:56.790
She's hypotensive with a major
chest defect and a contused lung.

06:56.960 --> 07:00.411
Notify the hospital. I need a setup
for a flap closure of an open chest.

07:00.588 --> 07:03.079
Let's go. We got your son.
He's gonna be okay.

07:03.842 --> 07:05.668
Get them out of there now.
We gotta go!

07:05.844 --> 07:08.002
Let's go, doc. Now!

07:08.638 --> 07:12.089
He's okay. He's barely got a scratch.
You're okay, little man.

07:12.267 --> 07:15.137
I was trying to protect Mom,
she made me get in the hutch...

07:15.311 --> 07:17.885
- and she got in front of me.
- That's what moms do.

07:18.523 --> 07:21.440
<i>We go live to Willow City
where several hikers...</i>

07:21.609 --> 07:24.065
Nurse Mollie's niece's number,
in case you lost it.

07:24.237 --> 07:26.692
She's given it to me about
three times already.

07:26.865 --> 07:28.489
I'm running out of excuses.

07:28.658 --> 07:30.532
- Tell her you have a girlfriend.
- Can't.

07:30.702 --> 07:32.304
My last excuse
was I was getting over a breakup.

07:32.328 --> 07:34.321
She thinks I should get back
on the horse.

07:34.497 --> 07:35.826
Tell her I'm your new horse.

07:35.999 --> 07:38.786
Then she'll leave you be and
the nerds will leave me be.

07:38.960 --> 07:41.118
I'm sure you can buck
with the best of them...

07:41.296 --> 07:44.213
but workplace, you're an intern,
might seem inappropriate.

07:44.382 --> 07:45.960
I don't wanna draw attention.

07:46.134 --> 07:47.379
You know, if you ask me...

07:47.552 --> 07:50.553
your wife should be here pushing
you around in a wheelchair.

07:50.722 --> 07:53.676
Yeah, her gaining 70 pounds
and giant haemorrhoids...

07:53.850 --> 07:56.305
doesn't exactly amp up
her sympathy for me.

07:56.477 --> 07:57.640
- Hey, Maya?
- Yes, Topher?

07:57.812 --> 07:59.354
That must've been a happy house.

07:59.522 --> 08:00.981
Yeah... Thank you.

08:01.149 --> 08:03.188
She and my daughter
went to her mother's...

08:03.359 --> 08:05.850
to let me recover in peace.

08:06.029 --> 08:09.729
- I get a little cranky as a patient.
- Hey.

08:10.158 --> 08:13.361
You guys know where
I can find Dr. De la Cruz?

08:13.536 --> 08:17.036
- How about you let me look at that.
- I'm looking for Dr. De la Cruz.

08:17.207 --> 08:19.698
- Hey. Okay. Take it easy, pal.
- It's okay, Kenny.

08:19.876 --> 08:21.833
Why don't go grab Landry?

08:22.003 --> 08:24.375
Maybe alert Dr. Nightstick
over there to be ready?

08:24.547 --> 08:27.382
- Yeah. I got you.
- Hey.

08:27.550 --> 08:30.504
So you know her?
You know Dr. De la Cruz?

08:30.678 --> 08:31.758
Yes.

08:31.930 --> 08:34.931
Set me up for intubation with
a Mac three and 7-0 ET tube.

08:35.099 --> 08:37.139
- What do we have?
- Pulmonary hernia.

08:37.309 --> 08:40.644
- You have to make her better.
- Ernie, she's gonna be fine, I promise.

08:40.813 --> 08:42.687
Get her prepped.
We have to get changed.

08:42.857 --> 08:45.644
Hey, Paul, come here.
This is our new friend Ernie, okay?

08:45.818 --> 08:47.728
Check him for cuts.
Find a nurse...

08:47.904 --> 08:51.569
to look after him while we take care
of his mother. Thank you.

08:51.741 --> 08:54.659
Hey, Ernie. I'm Paul.

08:55.787 --> 08:56.866
Hey, you cold?

09:04.003 --> 09:05.795
Come on.

09:09.467 --> 09:11.259
- What do we got?
- Pulse ox 75 percent.

09:11.427 --> 09:12.708
BP's 84 systolic.

09:12.887 --> 09:14.796
She's already on 100 percent oxygen.

09:14.973 --> 09:17.808
There's a huge air leak
from the bronchopulmonary injury...

09:17.976 --> 09:19.870
on the right side. We need
to divert ventilation to the left side...

09:19.894 --> 09:23.014
- or her stats won't come up.
- Systolic's 60. Pulse is thready.

09:23.189 --> 09:26.938
- You tried to intubate her left bronchus?
- No time. Let's do a Texas Twist.

09:27.110 --> 09:28.604
- I've done them.
- Not like this.

09:28.778 --> 09:32.443
Only if you were in the battlefield.
Pickups and scalpel to Dr. Clemmens.

09:32.740 --> 09:34.899
Cut the inferior ligaments proximally.

09:35.076 --> 09:36.784
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

09:36.953 --> 09:41.116
- Okay. Done.
- Rotating the hilum now.

09:47.630 --> 09:49.374
See? A little faster.

09:49.549 --> 09:51.127
I'll suture it down.

09:59.017 --> 10:01.342
- Oxygen's up to 92 percent.
- Okay.

10:01.519 --> 10:04.093
- New BP's 114 over 70.
- Son of a bitch.

10:04.689 --> 10:08.307
Texas Twist. Nice job, both of you.

10:08.484 --> 10:11.402
- We got to get her to the OR.
- I got it from here.

10:11.571 --> 10:13.279
I got it. She needs a surgeon.

10:13.448 --> 10:16.153
- I heard you. She's my patient.
- She's not your patient.

10:16.326 --> 10:19.492
You did a great job stabilising her
but she needs surgery now.

10:19.662 --> 10:20.742
I'm going with you.

10:20.914 --> 10:23.369
We do things differently
around here.

10:24.042 --> 10:25.915
He a dick to everyone
or just me?

10:26.085 --> 10:27.745
He's passionate about his patients.

10:27.921 --> 10:29.712
Yeah. So am I, but I'm not a dick.

10:30.632 --> 10:34.166
Gotta say, though, this night shift's
pretty baller. I like getting out.

10:42.602 --> 10:45.638
- Hey, Chulita.
- What are you doing here?

10:46.231 --> 10:51.569
- You two know each other?
- I know her real well, I'm her daddy.

10:52.695 --> 10:55.862
He's very lucky
that the knife didn't hit an artery.

10:56.658 --> 10:57.986
Too bad he didn't bleed out.

11:00.036 --> 11:01.863
Well, she got a temper, huh?

11:04.040 --> 11:06.958
How long my little girl
been working here?

11:07.126 --> 11:10.542
Must be making bank, no?

11:12.882 --> 11:18.125
What's a job like this pay, anyway?
Just, you know, ballpark?

11:19.013 --> 11:20.638
What do you think, sweetie?

11:21.683 --> 11:22.762
You got a name?

11:22.976 --> 11:25.348
You know what?
You're being really inappropriate.

11:25.520 --> 11:28.770
I'd appreciate it if you would stop ta...

11:33.319 --> 11:36.190
- It's not a good time, honey.
<i>- I don't know where we are!</i>

11:36.364 --> 11:38.191
- <i>We're in, like...</i>
- Wait. Whe...?

11:38.366 --> 11:40.987
Hold... Sh... Slow down.

11:41.160 --> 11:42.785
I can't hear you.

11:45.373 --> 11:46.784
What do you mean?

11:46.958 --> 11:49.531
What do you mean that you kind
of got in an accident?

11:49.878 --> 11:53.460
I'll be back when I can.
And I need an ambulance.

11:53.631 --> 11:56.917
They're blocked in the bay.
You can't go. We're shorthanded.

11:57.093 --> 12:02.004
My wife is in labour on the side of
a road, having twins. I'm leaving.

12:10.440 --> 12:13.061
<i>The roads in Willow City
have been shut down complete...</i>

12:14.027 --> 12:16.600
Sorry, folks. Power conservation.

12:19.407 --> 12:21.613
This is good. Thank you.

12:21.993 --> 12:24.116
Hey, anything from TXU?

12:24.287 --> 12:26.992
They haven't even started
on the transmission station...

12:27.165 --> 12:30.498
but we have enough fuel if the rest of
San Antonio doesn't show up.

12:30.668 --> 12:34.002
- We need Topher back. Where is TC?
- He was in the OR. Heather, did...

12:34.172 --> 12:36.497
I told TC you needed him
but he's still in there.

12:36.674 --> 12:39.509
All right, I'll get him.
Get Drew to take this man.

12:39.677 --> 12:41.421
- On it.
- Hey, Landry?

12:41.596 --> 12:43.754
Can you do some medical intake?

12:44.766 --> 12:45.880
As soon as I get back.

12:46.059 --> 12:48.514
- You all are healed.
- Thanks.

12:48.686 --> 12:50.726
We need
to get the walking wounded...

12:50.897 --> 12:54.432
into the waiting room for triage.
We're running out of space here.

12:55.318 --> 12:58.153
Dr. De la Cruz?
Your dad's kind of not leaving?

12:58.738 --> 13:01.573
- He keeps asking for you.
- Okay.

13:13.962 --> 13:15.420
I'm coming.

13:15.588 --> 13:18.922
<i>The road is clogged.
I'm trying to find you. Just hang on.</i>

13:19.092 --> 13:22.128
Last time your labour took 12 hours.
You just relax, baby.

13:22.303 --> 13:24.462
<i>No, get here faster!</i>

13:25.431 --> 13:27.590
- Can you put Lynn on?
- Here.

13:27.767 --> 13:30.602
Dad, where are you?
It's getting really weird in here.

13:30.770 --> 13:32.099
I'm close. I'm almost there.

13:32.272 --> 13:34.941
Just give your mom a towel
or a t-shirt to bite on.

13:35.108 --> 13:36.650
You need to get here now.

13:36.818 --> 13:39.735
Now, what I need you to do
is reach into your mom's vagina...

13:39.904 --> 13:42.442
and tell me if her cervix
is starting to open.

13:44.534 --> 13:47.985
- With what?
- Just Purell your finger, honey.

13:48.162 --> 13:50.654
<i>Come on, I know you can do it.</i>

13:53.001 --> 13:57.627
- Oh, are you checking?
- I think so.

13:57.797 --> 14:00.917
It's squishy, like a banana, or oatmeal.

14:01.092 --> 14:03.168
Can you tell me
if it's starting to open?

14:03.344 --> 14:06.049
- Not really. Everything's just too wet.
- Wet? How wet?

14:06.222 --> 14:08.892
- The whole seat is soaked.
<i>- Oh, God. Where are you?</i>

14:09.058 --> 14:11.466
- Honk the horn. Honk the horn.
- Oh, God.

14:23.615 --> 14:26.188
Oh, God,
here comes Gandalf the Horny.

14:26.618 --> 14:29.322
What's the issue? He'll give you
all the x-rays you need.

14:29.495 --> 14:32.165
- Go out with him once.
- You go out with Mollie's niece.

14:32.332 --> 14:34.538
Yeah, I can't.
She'll be on me even more.

14:34.709 --> 14:37.580
Like, " Did you like her? Are you
gonna call her?" Forget it.

14:37.754 --> 14:40.459
You gotta figure out something.
She's coming over.

14:40.632 --> 14:43.586
- Wait. What?
- Drew, I got my niece Tracy on the line.

14:43.760 --> 14:45.587
- Just kiss me. Kiss me.
- What do...?

14:54.187 --> 14:56.393
All right, problem solved.

14:59.025 --> 15:03.521
All right, we're ready, here we go.
It's a little less crazy inside here.

15:03.696 --> 15:07.445
Also, I found a very special
Band-Aid for your scratch.

15:07.617 --> 15:11.200
I know it's impressive. Here we go.

15:12.205 --> 15:15.989
All right, let's see. Okay.

15:16.960 --> 15:18.620
<i>Voilà.</i> There we go.

15:19.587 --> 15:20.868
I wanna see my mommy.

15:21.923 --> 15:26.217
I know you do, bud. But the doctors
are still upstairs fixing her up, okay?

15:26.386 --> 15:28.462
Hey, let's get you warm, yeah?

15:29.597 --> 15:31.471
Okay.

15:34.435 --> 15:35.978
Can I stay with you?

15:37.814 --> 15:38.893
Not really.

15:39.065 --> 15:43.015
Because I have some other patients
that I have to help out first, okay?

15:43.194 --> 15:44.309
So I'll...

15:46.364 --> 15:49.484
Hey. No, no, no. Don't do that.

15:49.993 --> 15:54.904
You can definitely stay with me, okay?
Because I actually need your help.

15:55.081 --> 15:57.121
I have these tags
to put on some patients.

15:57.292 --> 15:59.664
Tells the doctors
who they should treat first.

15:59.836 --> 16:02.291
Think you can maybe help me
with that or?

16:02.463 --> 16:06.544
Yeah? Okay. Let's go get them.
Let's go get them.

16:11.347 --> 16:12.379
Interesting.

16:12.557 --> 16:15.226
I've never worked
in a hospital where the ER docs...

16:15.393 --> 16:17.599
- operate alongside surgeons.
- Yeah?

16:17.770 --> 16:19.728
Well, maybe you'll
learn something new.

16:19.898 --> 16:22.519
- Actually, I'm learning a lot.
- Good.

16:24.569 --> 16:27.736
TC, I sent Heather up here
ten minutes ago to get you.

16:27.906 --> 16:30.823
We are seriously short
on attendings downstairs.

16:30.992 --> 16:34.491
- Watch that bleeder.
- Yeah, 4-0 silk to me. I'll tie it off.

16:43.838 --> 16:48.002
TC. I know your patients mean
a lot to you but I've got this.

16:48.176 --> 16:51.046
- Seriously.
- And I need you in the ER.

16:54.516 --> 16:56.555
Topher's wife went
into labour somewhere...

16:56.726 --> 16:59.015
on the road and he took off to get her.

16:59.187 --> 17:00.978
- Did he say where?
- No.

17:02.398 --> 17:04.771
Take that. Take it.

17:06.109 --> 17:09.230
T, you can't go. All right?
I don't like this situation either...

17:09.405 --> 17:12.109
but like I said we are
seriously short on attendings.

17:12.282 --> 17:14.192
- Page me if you need me.
- I won't.

17:17.204 --> 17:18.367
Set me up to close.

17:19.665 --> 17:20.780
It's not going through.

17:20.959 --> 17:22.666
The towers
are probably overloaded.

17:22.836 --> 17:24.709
Look, Topher and Janet will be okay.

17:24.878 --> 17:27.121
Her labour took
12 hours the last time...

17:27.298 --> 17:31.592
so hopefully she'll be back
before her water even breaks.

17:31.761 --> 17:36.637
- And we need you downstairs.
- Yeah. Okay.

17:36.808 --> 17:39.477
- Scott is an excellent surgeon.
- Yeah, he's good.

17:39.644 --> 17:42.135
- I just don't like...
- Anyone telling you what to do.

17:42.313 --> 17:45.599
There's a pecking order. If he
comes here, learn to work together.

17:45.775 --> 17:49.476
- If... If he comes?
- We haven't decided yet.

17:50.613 --> 17:52.072
- Okay, sure.
- What?

17:52.240 --> 17:54.992
Oh, it's just...
Ragosa wants him here.

17:55.159 --> 17:56.784
Scott seems to wanna be here.

17:56.953 --> 17:59.325
Just wondering what the holdup is.

17:59.831 --> 18:03.034
Grab a patient.
We're getting backed up.

18:04.919 --> 18:09.961
Okay, Ernie, you should probably eat
a little something, even if it's this crap.

18:10.508 --> 18:12.216
You can also play with my phone.

18:12.385 --> 18:15.635
I will check on you every 20
minutes but I gotta get back, okay?

18:15.805 --> 18:19.803
So, hey, up high. Hey. What is it?

18:19.976 --> 18:21.850
My shoulder hurts.

18:22.020 --> 18:24.593
That's weird.
It wasn't tender before, right?

18:25.190 --> 18:27.229
Okay, let's see.

18:28.985 --> 18:34.026
There's no bruising or anything.
Just that itty bitty cut on your back.

18:41.372 --> 18:42.950
You cannot keep
bothering people.

18:43.124 --> 18:46.327
I've had three different nurses tell me
that you're looking for me.

18:46.503 --> 18:48.045
- It worked.
- This is a hospital.

18:48.213 --> 18:50.964
People have jobs to do
so that other people don't die...

18:51.132 --> 18:52.507
and tonight is swamped...

18:52.675 --> 18:55.380
so you have one minute
to say what you need to say...

18:55.553 --> 18:58.471
- and then you gotta leave.
- Not loving the attitude.

18:58.640 --> 19:02.222
And I know that you just want money
so now you have 50 seconds.

19:02.393 --> 19:04.303
Don't talk to me like that.

19:06.022 --> 19:07.267
How much do you need?

19:09.817 --> 19:11.644
Just say it.

19:13.321 --> 19:15.195
Five K.

19:16.866 --> 19:18.658
What?

19:20.036 --> 19:21.945
I got in with the wrong people.

19:22.121 --> 19:23.995
You're always
with the wrong people.

19:26.334 --> 19:28.077
I don't have it.

19:28.253 --> 19:31.752
Even if I did have it, I wouldn't give it
to you. I'm done with you.

19:31.923 --> 19:34.165
You are never done
with your family.

19:34.342 --> 19:38.174
I didn't say I was done with my family.
I said I was done with you. Now leave.

19:39.514 --> 19:44.425
Yeah. Look at you, all your fancy
friends giving me the stink eye.

19:44.602 --> 19:47.852
Bunch of snobs from the north side,
that's all that is.

19:48.022 --> 19:50.560
To think of you abandoning me
for the likes of that.

19:50.733 --> 19:52.809
Me abandon you?

19:52.986 --> 19:55.903
I have worked like an animal
for everything that I have...

19:56.072 --> 19:58.444
and I never got anything
but grief from you.

19:59.242 --> 20:02.159
You wrecked my childhood.
You stole my money.

20:02.328 --> 20:03.953
You completely
screwed up my life!

20:07.000 --> 20:10.665
You abandoned me a long,
long time ago.

20:10.837 --> 20:13.328
Landry, I need the money!

20:15.758 --> 20:18.510
Did anybody miss anything,
or do I need to repeat it?

20:18.678 --> 20:20.754
No? Good.

20:28.646 --> 20:31.351
Hey, hey there. Dwayne, right?
Do me a solid, would you?

20:31.524 --> 20:33.813
This little dude needs a
CT scan kind of quick.

20:33.985 --> 20:36.274
Not how it works, new guy.
Back of the line.

20:36.446 --> 20:38.984
Right. See, the thing is, Ernie,
that's his name...

20:39.157 --> 20:41.399
may have a positive kehr sign.

20:41.576 --> 20:44.281
Irritation of the diaphragm
from intra-abdominal blood...

20:44.454 --> 20:45.996
causing referred shoulder pain.

20:46.164 --> 20:50.873
Lot of big words, doc.
Like I said, back of the line. You dig?

20:52.545 --> 20:56.413
Let me translate, tech dork. This
little kid just lost his home tonight.

20:56.591 --> 20:58.584
His mom is upstairs
circling the drain...

20:58.760 --> 21:00.836
and he might be
haemorrhaging internally.

21:01.012 --> 21:04.346
So he could die.
Now do you dig?

21:07.894 --> 21:10.432
I've got a mole on my inner
thigh I want removed.

21:10.605 --> 21:12.894
Get rid of it,
he goes to the front of the line.

21:13.066 --> 21:15.308
Just do it, or I will rip it off.

21:34.712 --> 21:37.832
Dad, it's coming.
I can see its head.

21:48.226 --> 21:52.271
There he is. I knew there was a reason
why you wouldn't call my niece.

21:52.438 --> 21:53.470
I'm not that...

21:55.400 --> 21:58.151
Sorry. I guess,
I should've said something.

21:58.319 --> 22:00.893
You're a dog. All men are dogs.

22:01.072 --> 22:04.239
But I like Krista.
So you better not mess this up.

22:04.993 --> 22:07.780
- I got my eye on you, buster.
- Yes, ma'am.

22:07.954 --> 22:09.697
I just got paged?

22:09.873 --> 22:12.743
S.A.P.D. Brought in a naked guy
they found at Circle K.

22:12.917 --> 22:15.242
They placed a hold
for grave disability.

22:21.551 --> 22:24.303
Can you grab toga man
and put him in curtain three?

22:24.679 --> 22:27.846
- Sure thing, doc.
- Thanks.

22:29.475 --> 22:31.967
- Hey, hey. You okay?
- I'm fine.

22:32.395 --> 22:35.182
Okay. I see your dad's still here.

22:35.607 --> 22:37.350
He likes to make me uncomfortable.

22:37.525 --> 22:41.025
- You want me to throw him out?
- He'll just keeping coming back.

22:42.030 --> 22:43.773
Look, I appreciate the concern...

22:43.948 --> 22:47.531
but this is just way too involved
and complicated to explain.

22:47.702 --> 22:51.367
- I'm just trying to help.
- I know. It's what you do...

22:51.539 --> 22:56.367
but we don't have a relationship
where we talk about things. Do we?

22:57.545 --> 23:00.036
That doesn't mean
we still can't talk about things.

23:00.215 --> 23:04.508
I've been thinking and I don't know
what's going on with you and Jordan...

23:04.677 --> 23:06.655
and I don't think either of you know
what's going on with you and Jordan...

23:06.679 --> 23:10.048
but I just know that I don't wanna
be in the middle of it anymore.

23:10.225 --> 23:14.637
- There is nothing with me and Jordan.
- You guys have unresolved feelings...

23:14.812 --> 23:18.893
and I'm not really into being plan B
so let's just be friends.

23:20.902 --> 23:22.693
And thank you for offering to help...

23:22.862 --> 23:25.187
but I'm used to handling
things on my own.

23:25.365 --> 23:28.069
If you still wanna talk about anything,
I'm...

23:28.243 --> 23:31.113
TC, Paul needs you in radiology.
It's the kid.

23:31.287 --> 23:32.995
Yeah.

23:36.543 --> 23:38.334
- What happened?
- He was complaining...

23:38.503 --> 23:39.897
of referred shoulder pain,
so I ordered a CAT scan...

23:39.921 --> 23:41.482
- but he lost his pulse.
- Hold CPR a minute.

23:41.506 --> 23:43.545
I need to see his underlying rhythm.

23:44.300 --> 23:46.672
Sine wave, damn it.
His potassium's sky high.

23:46.845 --> 23:49.086
It looks like shrapnel
transected the ureter.

23:49.264 --> 23:50.592
From that cut on his ribs.

23:50.765 --> 23:53.386
The kidney trauma must
have put him into renal failure.

23:53.560 --> 23:55.040
Which explains
the elevated potassium.

23:55.103 --> 23:57.676
He needs an amp of
calcium chloride, sodium bicarb...

23:57.856 --> 23:59.124
- and ten units of insulin.
- That's good.

23:59.148 --> 24:01.556

for emergency dialysis.

24:01.734 --> 24:03.312
- Calling now.
- Meds are in.

24:03.486 --> 24:05.693
- Rhythm's stabilising.
- He's got a pulse?

24:05.864 --> 24:06.943
Okay, that's good.

24:07.115 --> 24:08.342
Does that mean
he's gonna be all right?

24:08.366 --> 24:11.071
The meds are a quick fix.
His potassium's still sky high.

24:11.244 --> 24:14.529
Grab that scan. Let's go.
He needs dialysis, ASAP.

24:17.208 --> 24:19.367
Come on, baby.
Just one more push.

24:19.544 --> 24:22.165
I know you got it in you.
Come on. Dig deep.

24:22.338 --> 24:25.588
- Push, Mom, push.
- That's it. You got the kit?

24:25.758 --> 24:32.212
- Yeah.
- Yes! We have a baby girl!

24:32.390 --> 24:33.849
Hi, gorgeous.

24:34.017 --> 24:37.468
- Is she okay?
- Yes. She's so beautiful.

24:37.645 --> 24:39.437
Lynn, we gotta
cut the umbilical cord.

24:39.606 --> 24:41.016
Get the clamps and scissors.

24:41.191 --> 24:43.598
Just clamp here and here
and cut in between.

24:43.776 --> 24:45.686
Look what you did.
Look what you made.

24:45.862 --> 24:50.488
You made an angel. Look
at your little sister. There's your sister.

24:50.658 --> 24:53.862
Grab your hoodie and let's
wrap her in something clean.

24:55.663 --> 24:57.537
My gosh.

24:57.957 --> 25:00.744
You ready for round two?
You got the flashlight?

25:00.919 --> 25:02.745
Yeah.

25:03.338 --> 25:07.086
- Daddy, what is that?
- What is it? What's wrong?

25:07.258 --> 25:09.666
- Nothing. It's a foot.
- A what?

25:09.844 --> 25:11.718
Everybody just stay calm.

25:11.888 --> 25:13.991
I'm just gonna reach in there
and turn this little girl around.

25:14.015 --> 25:15.509
Hold the baby.

25:16.434 --> 25:19.055
Okay, we need to get to the hospital.
Baby's in breech.

25:19.229 --> 25:20.937
- Can't be born like this.
- What do I do?

25:21.105 --> 25:22.730
I need you to grab my phone.

25:22.899 --> 25:24.477
Run around, find a signal.

25:24.651 --> 25:27.521
911 is probably overwhelmed.
I need you to call Uncle TC.

25:27.695 --> 25:29.984
- Tell him I need him right now. Go, go.
- Okay.

25:32.075 --> 25:34.992
No. No. Where did you send her?

25:35.161 --> 25:37.913
- What's wrong?
- Nothing is wrong.

25:38.081 --> 25:39.658
Tell me what's wrong.

25:45.463 --> 25:47.171
That was a good catch.

25:47.340 --> 25:51.385
We'd be ten steps behind
if you hadn't got the scan. Good call.

25:52.679 --> 25:56.379
Yeah. Just glad he's okay.
He's a really cool little guy.

25:57.058 --> 25:59.181
You have a way with kids, you know.

25:59.352 --> 26:02.768
You ever think about doing
a fellowship in ER Paediatrics?

26:02.939 --> 26:06.853
- No, never. That is not for me.
- Why?

26:07.026 --> 26:09.149
Well, I come from
a family of surgeons.

26:09.612 --> 26:13.112
You know, my grandfather, my father,
both his brothers, both my brothers.

26:13.283 --> 26:15.738
You know, being an ER doc
is already pushing it...

26:15.910 --> 26:18.235
so I'm just...
That's not for me.

26:19.414 --> 26:23.281
I don't know. It's just... If you have
a gift, just, you know, think about it.

26:34.596 --> 26:37.513
I'm really sorry you had
such a crappy day today.

26:38.641 --> 26:42.057
But I promise, everything is gonna
be awesome from here on out.

26:53.448 --> 26:56.651
It's okay, everybody.
This has happened before.

26:56.826 --> 27:01.155
The generators will kick on again
in just a few seconds.

27:04.542 --> 27:06.535
This is not a drill.
We are out of power.

27:12.467 --> 27:14.127
Keep manually
bagging your patients.

27:15.512 --> 27:17.072
We don't know how long
this is gonna last.

27:17.096 --> 27:19.587
Ragosa, what happened?
I thought we had enough fuel.

27:19.766 --> 27:22.969
We do. Damn generators flooded
because of the storm.

27:23.144 --> 27:26.311
We were gonna move them upstairs
but we never got to it.

27:26.481 --> 27:28.972
Maintenance is working on it
but it'll take a while.

27:29.150 --> 27:32.068
We're running power off the mini
gennies from the Tailgate...

27:32.237 --> 27:33.316
and food trucks.

27:33.488 --> 27:35.646
Run cable to as many trauma
rooms as possible.

27:35.823 --> 27:38.315
Take off the exit signs
and use their battery lights.

27:38.493 --> 27:41.031
We can't stay open.
The entire first floor is out.

27:41.204 --> 27:43.362
We have to send ambulances
to other hospitals.

27:43.540 --> 27:44.571
We can't close.

27:44.749 --> 27:46.991
But what about the people who are here?

27:47.168 --> 27:50.003
- People are still coming in.
- If we don't, people will die.

27:50.171 --> 27:52.378
- We have to do what we can, okay?
- Okay.

27:52.549 --> 27:56.000
There's a construction site across
the street.

27:56.177 --> 27:58.086
Let's send staffers
to get their lights.

27:58.263 --> 27:59.805
I'll call the guys in my unit.

27:59.973 --> 28:02.261
- They can be here in ten.
- Do what you gotta do.

28:02.433 --> 28:05.802
I'll take any new cases. Man,
I could really use a nurse right now.

28:05.979 --> 28:08.434
Well, Michael can jump in.
He's got some training.

28:13.486 --> 28:15.278
- Just tell me what to do.
- Come on.

28:17.532 --> 28:20.568
- Topher, finally
- Uncle TC, can you hear me?

28:20.743 --> 28:23.614
I only have one bar
and my mom just had a baby.

28:23.788 --> 28:25.724
Here's what I need you to do.
Look at your phone...

28:25.748 --> 28:30.291
Open the GPS. Now give me
your exact location. Right.

28:30.461 --> 28:32.787
- It's mile marker 79.
- I'm really scared.

28:32.964 --> 28:35.799
- Hang tough. I'm gonna fix this.
- Ernie's dialysis is down.

28:35.967 --> 28:39.253
I figured it would be. Okay.
I got another idea. Let's go.

28:42.557 --> 28:46.175
Hey, it's TC. Yeah, I know there's
no games. I'm not betting.

28:46.352 --> 28:48.926
Listen, I need a gigantic favour.

28:49.105 --> 28:51.430
We don't have that long
on those small gennies...

28:51.608 --> 28:54.443
so I've got another solution.
We're gonna go old school.

28:54.611 --> 28:55.773
I will take any school.

28:55.945 --> 28:57.938
Vitals are going south.
QRS is widening.

28:58.114 --> 28:59.341
I pushed another amp of calcium,
it's not working.

28:59.365 --> 29:01.302
He'll be fine. We're gonna
do peritoneal dialysis.

29:01.326 --> 29:03.781
Give me the ladder, now.
Don't need any power.

29:03.953 --> 29:07.453
They do it a lot in places where they
don't have access to haemodialysis.

29:11.127 --> 29:14.911
Okay. Put these lights on his belly.

29:21.554 --> 29:25.006
- I feel weird.
- Your body's not doing its job right.

29:25.183 --> 29:29.015
We're gonna put medicine in your
stomach to suck out all the bad stuff.

29:29.187 --> 29:31.642
We just need to put a tube
inside your tummy, okay?

29:31.814 --> 29:33.225
- Okay.
- Okay.

29:34.317 --> 29:37.733
- You're gonna stay with me, Paul?
- You better believe it.

29:39.030 --> 29:40.524
I'm not going anywhere, okay?

29:42.116 --> 29:43.943
Here. Come on.

29:45.954 --> 29:47.993
All right, let's get these lights up,
guys.

29:48.164 --> 29:50.453
All right, point them towards
the trauma rooms.

29:50.625 --> 29:52.333
Let's give a big hand to Kenny...

29:52.502 --> 29:54.578
and the
Army Reserve Combat Support Team.

29:54.754 --> 29:56.711
Thank you, boys.

29:56.881 --> 29:57.960
Okay. Good.

29:59.467 --> 30:02.172
Wrap it tighter. The pressure
needs to stop the bleeding.

30:02.345 --> 30:04.338
- Like this?
- Exactly.

30:04.514 --> 30:07.799
Let me know if you're getting queasy.
Krista, how are we doing?

30:07.976 --> 30:09.304
- All under control.
- Landry?

30:09.477 --> 30:11.849
All good.
Haven't stitched anyone since school.

30:12.021 --> 30:14.429
Hope I didn't leave anything
inside her.

30:16.234 --> 30:17.265
Hey, listen.

30:17.694 --> 30:19.982
Landry, I know things
have been crazy...

30:20.154 --> 30:22.562
but if you need help
with the whole dad thing...

30:22.740 --> 30:26.441
- It's under control.
- Okay.

30:29.372 --> 30:30.997
- It will be. Excuse me.
- Sure.

30:36.629 --> 30:39.120
So how does TC treat
everybody on this shift?

30:39.299 --> 30:41.872
Great. He's intense
but he's a good guy.

30:42.594 --> 30:45.167
He and Jordan make a good team.

30:47.557 --> 30:52.302
Oh, damn it. The SVC tear extends
into the right atrium. Suction.

30:55.231 --> 30:57.983
Someone get TC.
I need a second pair of hands.

30:58.276 --> 30:59.818
Clamp.

31:00.195 --> 31:04.406
I got 500. It's the best I can do.
Now take it and get out of here.

31:04.574 --> 31:06.816
Five hundred ain't gonna do it.

31:06.993 --> 31:11.038
I didn't wanna upset you before
but if I don't get them their money...

31:13.124 --> 31:15.366
they're gonna take
it out on your ma.

31:17.295 --> 31:18.458
I don't believe you.

31:19.964 --> 31:25.504
They made threats and these people
don't play games. I know them.

31:25.678 --> 31:29.261
- I need five grand.
- I told you, I don't have it.

31:29.432 --> 31:31.638
The clothes you're
wearing tell me you do.

31:32.101 --> 31:35.802
I don't have it because I am
200 grand in debt from medical school.

31:35.980 --> 31:40.025
I pay for Julia and Tommy's private
school, which you should be doing.

31:40.193 --> 31:43.028
So don't talk to me about
what I have and I don't have.

31:43.196 --> 31:45.983
Okay, I'm sorry, I'm a jerk.

31:47.784 --> 31:54.403
But if you love your mama at all,
you'll get me the $5,000.

31:58.169 --> 32:02.997
And I'll be in the waiting room, waiting.

32:08.263 --> 32:09.757
What happened?

32:09.931 --> 32:12.552
The SVC tear has posterior
atrial involvement.

32:12.725 --> 32:13.953
I've used the heart-lung bypass
to make the repair...

32:13.977 --> 32:16.681
- but there's not enough power.
- Pressure's down to 60.

32:16.855 --> 32:19.690
If you've got any battlefield medicine
I'd love to hear it.

32:19.858 --> 32:21.482
If not, she's going to die.

32:28.116 --> 32:32.160
So it's true? Mom. You can't keep
letting him pull this crap.

32:32.662 --> 32:34.868
I wish you would leave him.

32:37.667 --> 32:39.126
Mom...

32:39.794 --> 32:42.795
I know you're scared.
It's gonna be okay.

32:45.133 --> 32:47.422
Just go to Titi's, okay?

32:47.635 --> 32:49.509
I'll figure it out.

32:50.180 --> 32:51.887
I love you.

32:54.517 --> 32:56.142
Landry.

32:56.728 --> 32:59.479
Man, I really gotta thank you
for the push.

32:59.647 --> 33:03.431
Actually working on a patient, you
would not believe what I just did.

33:03.610 --> 33:07.358
It was incredible. No, whoa, whoa.
What's wrong?

33:09.115 --> 33:10.574
Nothing.

33:11.075 --> 33:12.700
Nothing?

33:12.994 --> 33:16.493
Come on, I've told you everything
about me. What's going on?

33:20.793 --> 33:23.249
Jugulo-atrial shunt.

33:23.588 --> 33:25.877
It's the first one
of those I've ever witnessed.

33:26.049 --> 33:28.088
Maintains venous
return intraoperatively...

33:28.259 --> 33:30.881
so, you know,
no heart-lung machine is needed.

33:31.054 --> 33:32.927
- Pretty clever, man.
- Yeah.

33:33.097 --> 33:35.256
Saved my ass a couple
of times in Afghanistan.

33:38.228 --> 33:42.806
- Thank you, TC.
- Hey, it's my job.

33:43.358 --> 33:47.605
Hey, man, I should let you know...

33:47.779 --> 33:51.278
I'm going to take the job
as the new Head of Trauma Surgery.

33:51.991 --> 33:53.984
- Great.
- Yeah.

33:54.827 --> 33:56.950
Some reason you're telling me?

33:57.372 --> 34:00.076
Yeah, because things are going
to change around here.

34:00.250 --> 34:03.085
- Is that right?
- Yes, that's right.

34:04.295 --> 34:07.747
T? Topher just called.
He's five minutes away.

34:26.693 --> 34:29.397
- That's 400, TC. Cash money.
- Yeah, yeah.

34:29.571 --> 34:32.358
- You sent your bookie?
- He'll do anything for cash.

34:32.532 --> 34:36.945
First one slid right out, second's a
footling breech with cord prolapse.

34:37.120 --> 34:38.579
She has to come out now.

34:38.746 --> 34:41.581
Just try and relax, Janet, okay?
The lights came back on.

34:41.748 --> 34:43.659
That's a good sign.

34:43.835 --> 34:47.002
O.B. Just called. They rerouted her.
She's still 30 minutes away.

34:47.172 --> 34:48.547
Oh, come on. Son of a bitch.

34:48.715 --> 34:51.420
- TC, she wants to come out right now.
- Okay, we got this.

34:51.592 --> 34:55.590
- It's coming. I can't...
- It's okay.

34:55.763 --> 34:58.433
You are my champion, baby.

34:58.600 --> 35:01.269
- This is so humiliating.
- Why?

35:01.436 --> 35:05.765
Because you asked for this crap?
We don't get to choose our families.

35:07.233 --> 35:09.724
I will pay you back, I swear.

35:09.903 --> 35:13.852
I know you will or else
I'll garner your wages.

35:14.699 --> 35:17.653
I'm kidding. I'm just... I'm kidding.

35:18.494 --> 35:21.863
No, seriously,
you were a real big help to me.

35:22.040 --> 35:23.913
I'm happy to return the favour.

35:24.083 --> 35:27.832
But I do think you need
to cut ties with your dad.

35:31.424 --> 35:34.176
I cut ties with him,
I cut ties with my mom.

35:35.512 --> 35:40.138
Well, I don't know what to say
other than if you ever need someone...

35:40.308 --> 35:43.642
- to talk to I'm around.
- Thank you.

35:45.939 --> 35:48.560
Nobody's ever done anything
like this for me before.

35:48.733 --> 35:53.775
Well, maybe you've just been hanging
around with the wrong people.

35:56.241 --> 35:58.732
The body's out
but the head is stuck in the cervix.

35:58.910 --> 36:01.827
- The baby's heart is decelerating.
- I have an idea.

36:01.996 --> 36:04.783
- Let me try it. I need mayo scissors.
- Here.

36:04.958 --> 36:09.086
TC, I swear, if you say
one word about seeing my...

36:09.254 --> 36:13.382
Never get invited for dinner again?
I don't wanna blow that.

36:13.550 --> 36:14.664
- Help me.
- Okay.

36:14.843 --> 36:16.965
- Let's lift her legs up.
- Okay. That's good.

36:17.136 --> 36:18.364
I'm gonna make
a Duhrssen incision.

36:18.388 --> 36:21.554
Cutting the cervix should
let the head come down.

36:21.724 --> 36:24.891
Okay, keep breathing, Janet.
You, too, Topher.

36:25.061 --> 36:28.311
One, two, three.

36:31.317 --> 36:33.025
Breathe and push.
Breathe and push.

36:33.194 --> 36:36.029
It's working. You're doing so good.
The head's moving.

36:42.412 --> 36:45.496
- Is she...
- And she's out.

36:45.665 --> 36:49.829
- You did it. She's okay.
- Is she okay?

36:54.048 --> 36:57.464
Toph. Toph, she is so beautiful.

36:59.971 --> 37:02.177
Hey, hey, hey.

37:03.308 --> 37:08.515
I'm your Uncle TC.
Hey. Can you say "Uncle T"?

37:12.942 --> 37:15.350
Hello. Oh, I can't believe...

37:15.528 --> 37:19.608
- I love you, brother.
- Right back at you, buddy.

37:27.665 --> 37:29.872
Oh, okay. Okay.

37:33.838 --> 37:36.329
Hey, Ernie. Welcome back.

37:36.508 --> 37:38.334
Now you're a pretty strong little guy.

37:41.346 --> 37:44.797
- Where am I?
- I moved you to another room.

37:44.974 --> 37:49.102
I don't know. I figured you might want a
roommate or something like that so...

37:51.397 --> 37:52.892
Mommy.

37:53.608 --> 37:55.482
There's my boy.

37:57.987 --> 38:02.945
- I thought you were gonna die.
- And leave you, kiddo? No way.

38:03.576 --> 38:06.032
- I almost died.
- What?

38:06.204 --> 38:09.371
Yeah, it was a...
It was an interesting night.

38:09.541 --> 38:12.992
Actually, it started when you protected
your son from the storm...

38:13.169 --> 38:14.829
which was very brave.

38:15.004 --> 38:17.163
And you were very brave as well.

38:24.264 --> 38:26.470
<i>Thirteen dead and scores injured...</i>

38:26.641 --> 38:29.558
<i>in the worst storm this area
has seen in a decade.</i>

38:29.727 --> 38:33.013
<i>Now crews are finally able
to get to the part of San Antonio...</i>

38:38.278 --> 38:42.738
Hi, honey. How was your day?

38:46.119 --> 38:47.447
I got this text from Rick.

38:52.417 --> 38:53.697
Oh, my God, Drew.

38:55.170 --> 38:57.328
- He's coming home.
- Yeah.

38:57.964 --> 39:00.751
Yeah, he made it out of there.
He's coming home.

39:02.302 --> 39:04.460
He survived Afghanistan.

39:13.438 --> 39:15.146
Man.

39:15.732 --> 39:17.974
There's just something about
delivering a baby.

39:18.151 --> 39:20.274
I know, right? It never gets old.

39:20.445 --> 39:24.193
Plus now I can tell Janet I've had my
hands inside her till the day she dies.

39:24.365 --> 39:26.654
- What is wrong with you?
- I...

39:29.829 --> 39:31.738
Hey...

39:34.459 --> 39:37.329
So, you know,
Scott's coming here, right?

39:37.921 --> 39:41.337
Yeah. Yeah, he made sure to tell me.

39:43.301 --> 39:45.092
Yeah.

39:46.971 --> 39:48.466
Look...

39:50.767 --> 39:54.765
I know it's gonna change things and
it's gonna be weird for a while but...

39:54.938 --> 40:00.561
- Hey. Whatever, right?
- No. No.

40:01.069 --> 40:04.485
What I'm trying to say to you is
that in the past few months...

40:04.656 --> 40:09.531
that I've been working with you,
I feel like...

40:09.702 --> 40:14.245
we're getting back
to being friends again and I like that.

40:14.916 --> 40:17.751
I mean, we were always friends.

40:19.087 --> 40:22.586
Well, you were always my friend.

40:27.720 --> 40:31.220
- I wasn't the best there for a while.
- No.

40:31.391 --> 40:33.763
You had some things
that were beyond your control.

40:33.935 --> 40:35.892
Still...

40:40.316 --> 40:45.192
I'm sorry that I messed things up
between us.

40:49.909 --> 40:52.579
- Yeah, me too.
- Yeah, okay.

41:00.295 --> 41:02.168
Hey, Jordan...

41:04.883 --> 41:06.626
Scott was looking for you.

41:09.387 --> 41:10.418
Yeah. Okay.

41:22.901 --> 41:27.527
Okay, listen up, everybody.
Listen up.

41:29.157 --> 41:31.482
I have to thank you guys
for a great night.

41:32.535 --> 41:35.655
You did a bang-up job but now...

41:35.830 --> 41:39.994
I'd like to introduce the new Head of
Trauma Surgery, Dr. Scott Clemmens.

41:42.837 --> 41:46.289
Look at this. We have the prom
king and queen power couple...

41:46.466 --> 41:50.594
running this place. Give them a hand.
Yes.
