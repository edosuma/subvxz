Boo-boo.

02:54.087 --> 02:56.555
Couldn't we read another book?

02:58.725 --> 03:00.955
We've read this one a hundred times.

03:02.062 --> 03:04.223
Please?

03:04.464 --> 03:09.458
Nanny Gilbertine is so tired of
the Boo-boo book, she could just gag.

03:09.569 --> 03:11.628
Boo-boo.

03:13.473 --> 03:15.634
All right. All right.

03:18.512 --> 03:24.508
''One fine and sunny day,
Baby Boo's nanny Henrietta said

03:24.618 --> 03:30.386
'Baby Boo, today you shall go
on a wonderful adventure.'''

03:30.457 --> 03:33.722
'''You will see the many,
many sights of the Big City.'''

03:38.865 --> 03:42.631
''After a lovely breakfast
they walked down the lane to the corner,

03:42.702 --> 03:45.569
where they boarded a big, blue bus.''

03:46.840 --> 03:49.308
''They were on their way to the Big City.''

03:49.442 --> 03:52.309
''Baby Boo felt very grown-up indeed,

03:52.412 --> 03:56.041
for this was his first trip
away from Mother and Father.''

03:58.351 --> 04:00.012
Did l tell you?

04:00.086 --> 04:04.580
- Baby's having his picture taken today.
- Oh. Say hello to old Willy for me.

04:05.692 --> 04:10.220
Old Willy isn't doing it.
l've hired Downtown Baby Photographers.

04:11.831 --> 04:15.028
He's photographed Cotwell babies
since the Depression.

04:15.101 --> 04:18.434
Old Willy hasn't had a picture
in the paper in over 20 years.

04:18.505 --> 04:21.599
Everyone we know has had
their baby's picture in the paper.

04:21.675 --> 04:25.042
Baby Bink is almost a year old
and virtually unknown.

04:25.612 --> 04:31.050
l can't count the number of times l've been
asked why we're keeping our baby a secret.

04:32.852 --> 04:34.877
You're right.

04:34.988 --> 04:40.517
The only way to quiet such talk is to have our
small-minded friends open up their papers

04:40.627 --> 04:44.393
and see a photograph of
the prettiest baby in the city.

04:48.468 --> 04:52.427
- Get out! Come on!
- Come on, let's go. l said move it!

04:52.505 --> 04:54.405
Move it!

05:00.080 --> 05:03.675
Off with the fuzzy pink and blue sweaters,
nice and slow.

05:03.783 --> 05:06.946
- Ed, does it matter who wears pink or blue?
- No!

05:07.554 --> 05:11.046
Cotwell... Cotwell... Where is that little...

05:13.026 --> 05:15.290
Dinner with the Westfalls tonight.

05:15.395 --> 05:19.559
Don't forget to do your breathing exercises
Dr Phillips suggested.

05:19.633 --> 05:23.592
- l have a breathing scheduled at 11.
- Bless your soul.

05:24.571 --> 05:26.436
Have a wonderful day.

05:30.577 --> 05:32.841
Bing?

05:32.979 --> 05:35.038
What did you forget?

05:36.516 --> 05:39.451
Oh, my pen! Thank you, Andrews.

05:40.286 --> 05:42.379
What else?

05:43.423 --> 05:46.221
Darling, you know how
l hate games in the morning.

05:49.262 --> 05:51.992
Of course. Goodness, how could l forget?

05:52.298 --> 05:54.528
Don't you get...

05:54.634 --> 05:58.798
Don't you get into any mischief
while Dada's gone. Burble, burble.

05:58.872 --> 06:03.070
Won't it be exciting when he can understand
the wonderful things we say to him?

06:03.209 --> 06:05.871
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

06:36.376 --> 06:39.402
He can't look too butch,
but he can't look too feminine.

06:39.479 --> 06:42.277
He has to look angelic, like a little prince.

06:42.382 --> 06:45.283
That would suggest blue.

06:45.385 --> 06:49.719
Blue? Won't that look like we're trying to
match his eyes? Won't it be too obvious?

06:49.823 --> 06:53.088
l see lots of babies with
blue eyes and blue outfits.

06:53.193 --> 06:56.185
What kind of babies?
Rich babies? Pretty babies?

06:56.262 --> 06:59.493
- Regular babies? lmportant babies?
- Regular babies.

06:59.999 --> 07:02.593
Baby Bink is not a regular baby.

07:10.376 --> 07:12.344
Buff, buff, buff, buff, buff.

07:12.412 --> 07:14.846
Oh, but how shiny they're getting.

07:24.591 --> 07:26.650
Now, now. Hold still.

07:30.096 --> 07:33.429
Ready? Very, very handsome. Let me see.

08:03.563 --> 08:05.428
Hello.

08:07.600 --> 08:09.966
Get the gear.

08:10.670 --> 08:12.570
Get the gear.

08:12.639 --> 08:16.666
- He didn't say ''Get the gear, Veeko.''
- l'm the supervisor. You get it.

08:16.776 --> 08:19.939
You got the blue sweater.
You help me get the gear.

08:29.956 --> 08:33.982
A most pleasant and
charming good day to you, sir.

08:34.460 --> 08:37.793
l am Mr Charlie,

08:38.164 --> 08:44.193
photographer de babe,
entirely at your service.

08:48.274 --> 08:51.505
You were expecting us?

08:55.081 --> 08:57.641
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.

08:57.717 --> 09:00.242
Whoa, look at this place!

09:02.789 --> 09:04.654
Eddie.

09:13.032 --> 09:18.629
We ain't here to nick no bric-a-brac.
We're here for the hit of a lifetime.

09:18.738 --> 09:21.673
You wanna be a shoplifter, go to JC Penney.

09:30.216 --> 09:32.275
You think we can get away with this?

09:32.385 --> 09:36.287
No. l'm here because l've got
a wild curiosity about the electric chair.

09:37.056 --> 09:38.887
Sorry.

10:02.582 --> 10:05.107
What a gorgeous baby.

10:05.218 --> 10:07.584
You must be so proud.

10:08.421 --> 10:10.389
l'm Mrs Cotwell.

10:10.456 --> 10:12.185
l am Mr Charlie.

10:13.493 --> 10:15.393
Shall we begin?

10:28.508 --> 10:33.411
Mr Francis, if you will go to the vehicle
and retrieve my light meter.

10:42.455 --> 10:45.083
l'm going to be rich.

10:45.358 --> 10:48.054
l want individual photos of Baby Bink.

10:48.127 --> 10:51.722
Baby Bink? What
an absolutely delightful name.

10:51.831 --> 10:54.698
- lt's a pet name for Bennington.
- Certainly.

10:54.767 --> 10:58.897
l want individual photos of Baby Bink,
and then a portrait of the two of us.

10:58.972 --> 11:01.702
Whatever you wish, however you wish.

11:01.774 --> 11:04.766
You photographed
the children of many of my friends.

11:04.911 --> 11:09.109
Those pictures are forever appearing
in newspapers and magazines.

11:09.215 --> 11:11.274
lt is true.

11:12.618 --> 11:16.213
- His picture's never been published.
- That cannot be.

11:16.289 --> 11:17.984
lt's true.

11:18.057 --> 11:24.724
l am sure in the not-so-distant future
this little fellow will be very well known.

11:26.532 --> 11:29.126
l want your very best. l want art.

11:29.235 --> 11:32.830
l want you to set a new standard
for beauty in baby photography.

11:33.272 --> 11:35.866
l so welcome the challenge, madame.

11:35.942 --> 11:40.675
And, to that end, may l ask one small favor?

11:40.747 --> 11:44.274
May l have some time alone with the child?

11:49.255 --> 11:52.019
Oh, l need his complete attention.

11:52.091 --> 11:58.121
The great bond between you and your son,
his love for you, will distract him.

11:58.231 --> 12:05.103
l need to study his marvelous little features,
to learn how best to photograph him.

12:05.204 --> 12:11.109
He does well with persons
he is not intimate with?

12:14.914 --> 12:17.007
Does he?

12:17.850 --> 12:20.284
He's a friendly boy, but he may not like...

12:20.386 --> 12:22.183
Excellent!

12:22.622 --> 12:25.284
Madame, if l might make a suggestion.

12:25.892 --> 12:32.456
Your garment du jour, while
extremely magnificent, is so colorful,

12:32.532 --> 12:35.467
l am afraid it will dominate the photograph

12:35.535 --> 12:39.096
and detract from your natural beauty.

12:41.040 --> 12:44.601
l knew this outfit was wrong.
l'll be back in 15 minutes.

12:45.311 --> 12:48.644
Take all the time you need.

12:53.019 --> 12:55.510
lf he gets cranky,

12:55.621 --> 12:57.816
read him his book.

12:57.890 --> 12:59.949
How invaluable.

13:01.694 --> 13:03.685
Thank you.

13:19.812 --> 13:22.212
Mr Andrews, get the winter wardrobe.

13:22.281 --> 13:24.806
- But, madam...
- Hurry, Gilbertine.

13:37.997 --> 13:40.261
There you go.

13:40.399 --> 13:42.458
Take the book.

13:53.913 --> 13:57.007
Bink really deserves this moment
in the spotlight.

13:57.083 --> 14:00.712
lt's too bad the baby pictures
don't go on the front page.

14:01.621 --> 14:02.986
- Ma'am?
- Yeah?

14:14.767 --> 14:16.826
We gotta make this fast.

14:36.622 --> 14:38.681
l'm sorry it took so long.

14:46.532 --> 14:48.625
Where's Bink?

15:38.818 --> 15:40.615
Eddie?

15:40.686 --> 15:45.020
You're a smart guy. How do you tell
the front from the back on these diapers?

15:45.091 --> 15:47.616
Are there pockets in the front?

15:50.296 --> 15:55.791
- Very funny. The front and back are the same.
- Then it probably don't make no difference.

15:56.202 --> 16:01.731
Put him in them regular baby clothes. That
fruit suit's a dead giveaway he's a rich kid.

16:03.209 --> 16:05.803
Come on. Good boy.

16:36.208 --> 16:38.073
Ed?

16:38.177 --> 16:41.476
How do l know this milk
won't burn the kid's throat?

16:41.580 --> 16:43.571
lf that matters.

16:43.649 --> 16:46.311
Try it on some skin first.

16:54.727 --> 16:56.888
What's the matter with you?

16:57.730 --> 16:59.925
l better let it cool down.

17:03.636 --> 17:05.934
You like that?

17:06.005 --> 17:07.369
Eddie?

17:07.440 --> 17:09.532
Watch the baby.

17:15.414 --> 17:19.180
Very good. Now see if it works the other way.

17:26.058 --> 17:28.026
lt works.

17:35.368 --> 17:37.233
Put him in the bedroom.

17:37.303 --> 17:41.637
The more he sleeps, the less attention
he draws from the neighbors.

17:41.707 --> 17:44.505
- And keep an eye on him.
- Here you go, kid.

17:44.610 --> 17:47.841
That little doo-doo machine
is my retirement money.

17:49.014 --> 17:50.914
All right.

17:51.016 --> 17:53.177
Nappy-nap time, little jerk.

17:57.323 --> 17:59.518
Go to sleep real nice

17:59.625 --> 18:02.526
cos Mr Teddy Bear over here,

18:02.595 --> 18:06.656
he's been up all night drinking with
the Barbie dolls and he needs his rest.

18:07.032 --> 18:09.592
All right. Drink your milk.

18:09.668 --> 18:11.431
Take your nap.

18:12.605 --> 18:14.937
Drink your milk! Take your nap!

18:18.077 --> 18:20.170
- Eddie!
- What?

18:20.246 --> 18:24.444
You got any suggestions how you
get these things to eat and sleep?

18:25.017 --> 18:27.076
Sing him a song.

18:44.003 --> 18:49.999
~ Mary had a little lamb

18:52.044 --> 18:54.205
~ Little lamb

18:55.014 --> 18:57.073
~ Little lamb

18:57.883 --> 19:02.343
~ Mary had a little lamb

19:02.421 --> 19:05.754
~ Her hair was white as snow

19:06.759 --> 19:11.458
~ And every which way that Mary went

19:11.564 --> 19:14.055
~ The lamb was right behind her

19:15.034 --> 19:17.468
~ lt followed her to work one day

19:17.570 --> 19:20.539
~ Work one day, work one day

19:20.606 --> 19:24.542
~ lt followed her to work one day

19:24.610 --> 19:27.636
~ And Mary lost herjob

19:31.750 --> 19:34.844
Eddie! What else did Mary's little lamb do?

19:34.954 --> 19:38.014
Didn't he put Humpty Dumpty
back together again?

19:39.358 --> 19:41.758
That was Nat King Cole.

19:41.827 --> 19:47.424
Nat King Cole stuck his finger in the pie
and yanked out the bird.

19:47.566 --> 19:52.560
How can a lamb put a Humpty
together again? He ain't got fingers.

19:52.771 --> 19:56.002
~ And then she went to unemployment...

19:56.075 --> 20:00.273
Norby! Knock off the singin'
and read him his storybook.

20:02.114 --> 20:03.877
lf you can.

20:09.388 --> 20:11.447
Wanna hear a story?

20:14.460 --> 20:17.122
Let's see here. What do we got here?

20:25.738 --> 20:27.535
''Nanny...

20:27.673 --> 20:29.664
and Baby Boo...

20:31.810 --> 20:33.869
strolled...

20:33.946 --> 20:36.039
through...

20:36.115 --> 20:38.675
the great big...

20:41.253 --> 20:43.221
de...

20:45.024 --> 20:47.083
de...

20:48.327 --> 20:51.524
- department.
- ..department store.''

20:51.630 --> 20:55.464
''How many, many things there were to buy.''

20:56.101 --> 20:58.228
Or steal, if l was writin' that book.

20:59.138 --> 21:02.198
Or steal, if l was writin' this book.

21:37.042 --> 21:40.910
Mrs Cotwell? Dale Grissom, FBl.

21:41.013 --> 21:43.072
l'd like to ask you a few questions.

21:43.148 --> 21:45.446
You'll have to ask me later.

21:45.517 --> 21:50.147
- l'm going to look for my baby.
- l'd rather you didn't. l need you here.

21:51.523 --> 21:54.014
- Don't coddle me, Mr Grissom.
- Mrs Cotwell,

21:54.093 --> 21:58.894
there are five million people in this city
and many places where your boy could be.

21:58.964 --> 22:03.697
lt would be pointless and dangerous
for you to go out searching for your baby.

22:03.802 --> 22:08.398
l've been through a number of these cases.
l understand how you feel.

22:10.275 --> 22:12.766
Have you ever lost a child?

22:13.646 --> 22:15.113
No, ma'am.

22:15.481 --> 22:18.041
Then you can't possibly know how l feel.

22:20.252 --> 22:24.188
l apologize. But would you stay here, please?

22:24.690 --> 22:27.022
For your baby's sake.

24:09.394 --> 24:11.453
Do you gotta do that?

24:14.433 --> 24:16.492
l like to look nice.

24:17.169 --> 24:19.228
You gotta spit?

24:21.006 --> 24:25.204
l don't know about you,
but l don't eat pieces of my body.

24:58.143 --> 25:00.043
What?

25:00.879 --> 25:03.370
- What did l do?
- You spit on me.

25:03.448 --> 25:05.609
- l did not!
- Somebody did,

25:05.684 --> 25:07.982
and you're the only one in the room.

25:24.102 --> 25:26.161
You jerk!

25:26.238 --> 25:29.366
What? No, no. Quiet.

25:29.474 --> 25:32.443
- You're gonna wake up the baby.
- The baby's on the roof!

25:45.624 --> 25:48.525
Hurry. Come on, hurry.

26:10.148 --> 26:12.013
Eddie!

26:15.053 --> 26:17.544
Ed. Hey, Ed, what happened?

26:18.690 --> 26:20.385
Eddie, are you OK?

26:24.196 --> 26:27.962
- People shouldn't leave this lying around.
- What are you doing, dope?

26:28.066 --> 26:30.261
lt was in the way.

26:31.069 --> 26:33.003
- What happened?
- Right, pick him up.

26:33.071 --> 26:35.164
Eddie. Ed, you're drooling.

26:35.240 --> 26:40.303
- Eddie, come on. Come on, Ed. Come on.
- Eddie, what happened? Eddie?

26:40.846 --> 26:42.905
What? This way?

26:45.117 --> 26:47.813
Oh, great. lt's gotta be at least 1,000 feet.

26:47.886 --> 26:50.878
- Ed, we're gonna have to jump.
- We're gonnajump?

26:50.989 --> 26:54.447
- Yes. On three. Ready?
- OK.

26:54.593 --> 26:55.651
One.

26:55.794 --> 26:57.386
Two.

26:57.529 --> 26:58.496
Three.

27:06.738 --> 27:09.138
Eddie!

27:31.830 --> 27:34.264
Ed, look...

27:34.366 --> 27:36.266
out!

28:01.526 --> 28:04.393
- What?
- Package.

28:04.830 --> 28:09.324
- Where do you want me to sign?
- Anywhere's fine.

28:16.441 --> 28:18.932
Have a nice... day.

28:19.011 --> 28:21.070
You old bat.

28:24.249 --> 28:27.218
- Which way?
- This way.

28:40.966 --> 28:43.161
Ed!

28:43.235 --> 28:46.033
Are you all right?

28:46.104 --> 28:49.562
How can he be all right?
The guy fell off a building.

28:49.674 --> 28:54.634
Probably got contusions, concussions,
contractions. What's the matter with you?

29:14.166 --> 29:18.125
- Just take it easy. How you feelin'?
- Eddie, how many fingers l got up?

29:18.203 --> 29:21.195
- Two.
- Not you! Hey, Eddie, say somethin'.

29:21.273 --> 29:24.538
- Here, put him here.
- Sit down on the bench. Sit down.

29:24.876 --> 29:26.844
You OK?

29:26.945 --> 29:28.572
Eddie.

29:28.647 --> 29:30.512
When we first seen you fall,

29:30.582 --> 29:35.485
our first thoughts were with you
and your family, should you not survive.

29:35.620 --> 29:38.020
- l prayed, Eddie.
- Shut up!

30:00.011 --> 30:03.503
All right, take it easy.
You wanna maybe get to the right of him.

30:09.988 --> 30:12.252
Wait, Eddie. We don't wanna get a ticket.

30:16.661 --> 30:19.994
- Get to the right. Eddie, get to the right.
- Shut up!

30:22.801 --> 30:25.235
Move in front of him. l'll jump on the back.

30:25.303 --> 30:27.897
- You're makin' me nuts!
- OK. Don't get crazy.

30:32.110 --> 30:35.238
- Just drive. l'll tell you.
- See that lady over there?

30:35.313 --> 30:38.248
There he is! l see him! There he is!

30:39.050 --> 30:41.109
We got him.

30:42.754 --> 30:44.847
He's gone! We lost him!

30:53.098 --> 30:55.259
Look both ways!

30:57.035 --> 30:58.468
l think you hit a cat.

30:58.537 --> 31:02.871
Here's the bus. Eddie, you see it?
He's gettin' ahead of us, Eddie.

31:02.974 --> 31:05.272
There's the bus again.

31:10.081 --> 31:12.606
Driver, next stop, please.

31:27.666 --> 31:29.361
Wait, l don't see him.

31:36.074 --> 31:39.009
- There's the bus.
- l see the bus!

31:39.077 --> 31:41.136
l'll get him!

31:42.047 --> 31:44.481
Wait! Wait! Stop the bus.

31:45.750 --> 31:47.718
l forgot somethin'! Stop the bus!

31:47.819 --> 31:51.255
Wait, wait, wait! Hello! Stop the bus!

31:51.323 --> 31:55.726
Halt! Stop the bus! Wait! Stop the bus!

32:00.332 --> 32:04.666
Did a baby get off this bus?
A little guy, about two feet tall.

32:04.769 --> 32:08.227
- lt's an emergency!
- l didn't have nobody today with a baby.

32:08.440 --> 32:10.670
He was by himself!

32:14.112 --> 32:16.637
- What?
- He must have got off.

32:17.449 --> 32:19.781
Oh, great. We're through.

32:23.622 --> 32:26.591
lf you didn't park your van on the sidewalk,

32:26.658 --> 32:29.684
people could get by a lot easier.

32:32.631 --> 32:37.728
lf you'd limit yourself to a couple of pork
roasts a day, you wouldn't need to worry.

32:38.336 --> 32:39.769
You heard me.

32:46.711 --> 32:48.804
Some people.

32:52.017 --> 32:54.611
- Eddie, how could he get off?
- l seen him.

32:54.686 --> 32:57.416
- What?
- He's in the big broad's purse.

32:58.356 --> 33:03.760
Yeah, this is Carl in 157.
You know anything about a missing baby?

33:04.195 --> 33:07.596
l see her. How could you miss her?
She's as big as a building.

33:07.666 --> 33:11.033
- Eddie, let me do this.
- Will you stop it?

33:11.102 --> 33:15.402
- How do we do it?
- Nonchalant. We'll give her a sandwich.

33:15.473 --> 33:19.432
- She don't need a sandwich. Look at her.
- That's my whole point.

33:19.511 --> 33:21.843
Wait.

33:38.863 --> 33:40.296
Eddie.

33:40.398 --> 33:42.457
Get her, Veeko! You get her, Veeko!

33:44.336 --> 33:50.673
Get her, Veeko. You got her, Veek.
Hang in there, Veek. You got her! Come on!

33:50.909 --> 33:52.035
Who's next?

33:53.511 --> 33:58.073
How about you, Mr Comedy?
''We'll give her a sandwich,'' huh?

33:58.149 --> 34:01.016
''As big as a building,'' huh?

34:01.086 --> 34:04.681
Not so easy making jokes
with my fist in your mouth, is it?

34:04.789 --> 34:07.690
- l'm not afraid of you.
- Come on. She's crazy.

34:07.792 --> 34:10.590
Anybody else wanna take a shot?

34:15.567 --> 34:17.626
Chicken!

35:01.613 --> 35:05.379
How did you get out of
Mother Goose Corner?

35:20.031 --> 35:23.057
So, you got a nasty little surprise for me?

35:29.607 --> 35:31.837
You guys are worthless!

35:31.910 --> 35:34.242
Yeah, right, Eddie. Blame us.

35:34.779 --> 35:39.375
- You know, l'm gettin' sick of your insults.
- Then why don't you quit?

35:39.451 --> 35:44.218
- Oh, yeah? Let you two have all the money?
- What money? The kid is gone!

35:44.823 --> 35:47.291
There you go, my little escape artist.

35:51.529 --> 35:56.330
Now, if you were a baby
lost in the big city, where would you go?

36:19.791 --> 36:24.490
,,speculation, but a ransom figure
in the millions of dollars was mentioned,

36:24.596 --> 36:29.863
Security is tight around the Cotwell mansion
and at Cotwell lndustry Towers downtown,

36:29.968 --> 36:32.562
Ronnie Lee has more on the story, Ronnie?

36:32.670 --> 36:35.662
There's no word from police,
but our sources tell us

36:35.773 --> 36:40.403
that a nine-month-old baby boy was abducted
at approximately ten o'clock this morning,

36:40.512 --> 36:43.675
We have confirmed that
a photographer and two assistants

36:43.781 --> 36:46.409
from the Downtown
Baby Photographers studio

36:46.484 --> 36:50.477
were scheduled to photograph
the missing child today,

36:50.588 --> 36:53.819
A spokesman for the photography
studio declined to comment,

37:20.351 --> 37:27.189
,,extremely tight, ln fact, police
and FBl units have sealed off the area,

37:27.425 --> 37:31.885
Earlier l attempted to reach millionaire
Bennington Cotwell at his office.

37:32.297 --> 37:37.826
Though reporters were turned away,
a reliable source informed us that Cotwell...

37:41.506 --> 37:44.873
A spokesman for the company said
that Mr Cotwell was unavailable.

37:50.048 --> 37:54.451
Hang on a second. Keep rolling. OK.

38:14.672 --> 38:17.004
Where'd he go?

38:37.562 --> 38:39.689
We're always, like, this close.

38:55.046 --> 38:57.776
- Hello.
- Hello, ls this Mr Cotwell?

38:57.882 --> 39:02.114
- Yes. Who is this?
- My name's Depke, Joe, Joe Depke,

39:02.220 --> 39:07.886
Yeah, Listen, l might have some information
on the whereabouts of that child,

39:17.869 --> 39:20.429
- l seen the baby.
- Where?

39:20.538 --> 39:22.631
Right across the street on the curb.

39:22.707 --> 39:24.732
Where'd he go?

39:27.445 --> 39:30.744
lt's the craziest thing. l don't remember.

39:30.848 --> 39:33.749
Maybe we'll take a ride.
See if you remember then.

39:33.851 --> 39:37.309
- You want money? How much?
- Don't embarrass me. Don't insult me.

39:37.422 --> 39:40.823
- Your money's no good here. Put it away.
- Where's the baby?

39:40.892 --> 39:43.019
House across the street.

39:44.128 --> 39:46.221
Second floor.

39:47.765 --> 39:51.565
McCrays. No guarantee.
Listen, mister, l didn't know your kid.

39:51.669 --> 39:53.762
l just saw his picture on TV.

39:54.939 --> 39:57.430
l called because l care.

40:05.983 --> 40:09.248
- Your name's McCray?
- Yeah. What did l do?

40:09.320 --> 40:12.153
We're looking for a missing child.

40:12.256 --> 40:15.589
- These are my kids.
- Mind if we take a look?

40:20.064 --> 40:22.157
Hello, ma'am.

40:27.805 --> 40:30.171
Hi.

40:32.110 --> 40:34.169
Sir, in here.

40:45.690 --> 40:47.317
Baby.

41:13.885 --> 41:15.944
You have a beautiful little boy.

41:18.923 --> 41:20.982
Thank you, ma'am.

41:22.360 --> 41:24.453
l'll pray he comes back to you.

41:26.197 --> 41:30.998
These kids are all l've got, so l know
how l'd feel if l was in your place.

41:32.103 --> 41:34.162
l hope you never are.

41:36.174 --> 41:38.472
For your children's sake.

41:48.186 --> 41:50.279
Sorry we inconvenienced you.

41:51.489 --> 41:53.548
Be there in a second.

41:56.894 --> 41:59.988
- l'm sorry for the trouble.
- Sir?

42:01.132 --> 42:07.093
l believe in my heart that someone
somewhere watches over the babies.

42:10.107 --> 42:12.337
Yes, l hope so.

42:17.648 --> 42:20.116
You have everything? Are you sure?

42:41.672 --> 42:46.302
l can't believe this. You know,
it ain't the wisest strategy to kidnap a baby

42:46.377 --> 42:49.210
and then let the damn thing
loose on the streets.

42:49.313 --> 42:53.716
Babies crawling in traffic tend
to draw attention, don't you think?

43:03.361 --> 43:06.956
To the left, l think. You see? The cab.

43:17.942 --> 43:20.035
Got you now, you little...

43:27.518 --> 43:30.510
- Eddie!
- My money!

43:42.700 --> 43:45.601
Come on! Come on! Go! Go!

43:49.607 --> 43:51.598
Go! No, wait!

43:53.544 --> 43:55.409
Stay! Stay there!

43:55.513 --> 43:57.572
Stay there!

43:58.516 --> 43:59.983
Don't go!

44:01.085 --> 44:03.349
Go! Now! Watch your feet.

44:06.757 --> 44:08.224
Stay there!

44:08.292 --> 44:11.819
OK, hang on. One, two, three - go.

44:28.279 --> 44:33.581
l worked at Burger King three years.
This is worse than that.

44:33.684 --> 44:37.848
Don't blame me. We'd be restin' easy
if Butterfingers here hadn't lost the kid.

44:37.922 --> 44:41.756
l lost the kid? l lost the kid?
Oh, well, that's news to me.

44:41.859 --> 44:45.522
- Who fell asleep reading nursery stories?
- Who left the window open?

44:48.265 --> 44:51.723
- That was me.
- You idiots are why we don't got the kid.

44:51.802 --> 44:57.741
As far as l'm concerned, you can drop out and
l'll keep the $5m. You don't deserve a penny.

44:57.808 --> 45:00.504
- You'd stiff us?
- Wait a minute!

45:00.578 --> 45:05.481
Don't get hot, Eddie. Don't get hot.
We're all just tired from gettin' torn apart.

45:06.017 --> 45:10.454
Like l like to fall off buildings
and jump in ditches! That's the breaks.

45:10.521 --> 45:12.489
We're dealing with a baby.

45:12.556 --> 45:16.219
Babies are obviously
more dangerous than we thought.

45:16.293 --> 45:19.057
lt don't figure, Eddie. They're so small.

45:19.130 --> 45:22.622
When l boxed, the guys l most feared
were those who feared nothin'.

45:22.700 --> 45:26.067
Babies are like that -
they ain't afraid of nothin'.

45:29.974 --> 45:31.737
Baby tracks.

45:51.962 --> 45:54.294
Norby, hey.

46:55.793 --> 46:58.660
The kid's in the gorilla cage.

47:01.065 --> 47:03.533
There goes our five million bucks, huh?

47:05.736 --> 47:07.897
l think the ape likes the kid.

47:18.883 --> 47:22.649
- What?
- You got long arms.

47:25.156 --> 47:27.147
Thanks.

47:34.265 --> 47:36.233
l can't reach him, Eddie.

47:38.569 --> 47:41.163
That's it. You got it.

47:46.544 --> 47:48.637
Easy does it.

47:49.280 --> 47:52.772
That's it. Slow, slow, slow. There.

47:52.883 --> 47:54.544
Easy.

48:15.639 --> 48:18.130
Nice monkey.

48:19.210 --> 48:20.768
Yes.

48:22.046 --> 48:25.345
He's startin' to cry, Eddie.
He'll make the monkey mad.

48:28.185 --> 48:29.675
Eddie, he's gettin' up.

48:30.321 --> 48:34.417
- l'm afraid, Eddie.
- Freeze. Just stare him down.

48:39.964 --> 48:42.057
That's it.

49:11.462 --> 49:12.724
Shut up!

50:06.350 --> 50:08.944
Hey, King Kong. Hey, over here.

50:09.720 --> 50:11.915
l'm a banana.

50:12.056 --> 50:16.117
l'm a coconut. l'm an entire fruit salad.

50:16.460 --> 50:19.190
Over here. Hey, look. l'm the Jungle Boy.

50:19.296 --> 50:22.857
Over here. That's it.

50:23.467 --> 50:25.526
Now you got it.

50:28.005 --> 50:29.700
l got him.

50:34.311 --> 50:36.142
l got him.

50:39.750 --> 50:42.514
Bad monkey.

52:33.464 --> 52:35.523
- Eddie?
- Careful, Eddie.

54:02.452 --> 54:04.545
Eddie.

54:06.223 --> 54:08.748
l know you don't wanna hear this, but...

54:11.895 --> 54:13.954
the kid's gone again.

55:14.291 --> 55:18.159
This morning all l wanted
was my baby's picture in the paper.

55:25.502 --> 55:27.629
l got my wish.

55:31.074 --> 55:33.133
Where's your mommy?

56:08.512 --> 56:11.709
Hey, Eddie, maybe
he went down a rabbit hole.

56:11.815 --> 56:16.013
We're serious about our work.
You wanna make jokes, join the circus.

56:18.855 --> 56:20.720
Bozo.

56:29.099 --> 56:32.227
Step on it, Eddie. Baby, starboard side.

56:33.303 --> 56:34.736
- Starboard.
- What?

56:34.838 --> 56:36.931
- Port.
- What is that?

56:37.040 --> 56:38.473
- Point!
- Nine o'clock!

56:38.542 --> 56:41.443
- Where is he?
- Over here at 6:30.

56:43.480 --> 56:44.742
Step on it.

56:46.616 --> 56:49.141
You're ours now, moneybags.

56:59.563 --> 57:02.828
Did Baby Bink miss his Uncle Eddie?

57:06.036 --> 57:08.129
- Come here.
- Get him.

57:11.108 --> 57:13.599
- Did you get him?
- No! Come on!

57:24.721 --> 57:26.848
Where'd he go?

57:26.923 --> 57:30.051
He went down a rabbit hole.

57:31.928 --> 57:36.865
- Don't let those rabbits chew your face off.
- Shut up, Veeko. Just shut up!

57:38.568 --> 57:43.938
No problem, fellas. lt ain't a hole,
it's a tunnel. And what's every tunnel got?

57:44.007 --> 57:46.805
Don't tell me. l know, l know. lt's a...

57:47.644 --> 57:49.839
Toll booth at the end.

57:49.913 --> 57:53.781
Are you always this stupid,
or do you do this just to annoy me?

57:53.884 --> 57:58.878
A tunnel has two ends.
This one's here, and the other one's...

57:58.989 --> 58:01.389
Where? Come on.

58:15.305 --> 58:18.638
- Eddie, Eddie, Eddie.
- Get him, Norby. Get him.

58:18.708 --> 58:21.939
- Don't let him get away.
- Here he is, Eddie.

58:24.114 --> 58:27.311
Today ain't your lucky day, eh, shorty-pants?

58:29.252 --> 58:31.686
That wasn't so hard.

59:09.292 --> 59:12.819
- Beautiful day, huh?
- You know anything about that vehicle?

59:18.435 --> 59:21.063
Yes. lt belongs to us.

59:21.137 --> 59:23.037
You left the engine running.

59:23.340 --> 59:24.932
Yes.

59:25.041 --> 59:27.066
l did.

59:27.143 --> 59:30.874
l've been having battery trouble.

59:31.915 --> 59:35.510
We just stopped by to admire the beauti...

59:37.721 --> 59:41.157
beautiful flowers.

59:49.032 --> 59:52.024
Have you guys seen a baby around here?

59:52.235 --> 59:54.294
The park is full of...

59:56.072 --> 59:59.564
- babies.
- Yeah, well, there's been a kidnapping.

59:59.676 --> 01:00:02.167
Well, that's a cryin' shame.

01:00:02.512 --> 01:00:05.242
lt's amazing what people will do for money.

01:00:05.315 --> 01:00:07.374
Yeah, for five million...

01:00:08.551 --> 01:00:10.712
lf we see anything...

01:00:14.724 --> 01:00:16.487
Excuse me.

01:00:17.294 --> 01:00:21.458
lf we see anything, we'll be sure to notify...

01:00:50.827 --> 01:00:52.954
He's got a bad heart.

01:01:02.238 --> 01:01:04.297
Excuse me.

01:01:06.876 --> 01:01:08.935
The police.

01:01:09.746 --> 01:01:11.737
Thank you.

01:01:15.585 --> 01:01:20.579
Walk 'em to the car. My entire reproductive
system is about to go up in flames.

01:01:26.596 --> 01:01:29.064
ls that a Fleetline van?

01:01:31.501 --> 01:01:33.560
Eddie, is it?

01:01:34.604 --> 01:01:37.164
- Yes!
- Yes, it is.

01:01:37.273 --> 01:01:39.400
l thought so.

01:01:39.509 --> 01:01:42.410
My brother drives one
for a dry-cleaning firm.

01:01:42.512 --> 01:01:45.140
Oh, yeah, they drive a lot of those.

01:01:45.215 --> 01:01:47.706
He's always had a lot of trouble with his.

01:01:47.784 --> 01:01:53.381
Give me a second, l'll think of what he said
is the problem with the electrical system.

01:01:53.490 --> 01:01:55.549
- Alternator?
- No.

01:01:55.625 --> 01:01:58.025
- Carburetor?
- No.

01:01:59.529 --> 01:02:02.657
- There's this little relay thing.
- Veeko!

01:02:02.732 --> 01:02:04.859
Veeko.

01:02:04.934 --> 01:02:08.335
l think you should move the van.

01:02:08.438 --> 01:02:10.702
l have a frog in my throat.

01:02:12.442 --> 01:02:16.037
And a brush fire in my undershorts.
Get 'em outta here.

01:02:16.112 --> 01:02:20.708
lt's just a bad battery. l think we should
move it before the engine dies.

01:02:20.784 --> 01:02:25.744
Yeah, it's just the battery.
Let's get it outta here. Come on, let's...

01:02:35.565 --> 01:02:37.795
You sure can tell summer's here.

01:02:37.901 --> 01:02:40.369
People got those barbecues goin'.

01:02:44.307 --> 01:02:48.471
- Smells great, doesn't it?
- Come on, let's go move the van.

01:02:55.985 --> 01:02:57.885
l'll be right with you.

01:03:00.890 --> 01:03:03.723
l just have a cramp in my leg.

01:03:18.208 --> 01:03:20.073
Take it easy.

01:04:01.584 --> 01:04:03.950
That's how you put out campfires.

01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:07.351
ls that a fact?

01:04:07.457 --> 01:04:09.516
Used to do it in Boy Scouts.

01:04:11.361 --> 01:04:14.296
You toasted your marshmallows

01:04:14.364 --> 01:04:18.266
over a pile of flaming gonads?

01:04:19.502 --> 01:04:21.732
We usually used logs.

01:04:23.273 --> 01:04:25.264
Follow that kid!

01:04:25.341 --> 01:04:28.105
We'll meet you on the other side.

01:04:28.178 --> 01:04:31.079
l'm sorry, man, but it was an emergency.

01:04:31.147 --> 01:04:34.275
- You were blazin' pretty hard...
- Shut up!

01:04:43.259 --> 01:04:45.352
Oh, boy, Eddie.

01:04:45.461 --> 01:04:48.362
You got burnt clear through your skivvies.

01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:53.530
Baby Bink! lt's your mother!

01:04:53.603 --> 01:04:55.195
Baby Bink!

01:04:55.305 --> 01:04:58.274
l'll kill him.

01:05:38.114 --> 01:05:40.344
l'm sorry, ma'am.

01:05:46.289 --> 01:05:48.780
l haven't forgotten your feelings.

01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:53.253
My feelings don't matter.

01:06:04.941 --> 01:06:07.034
Yes, they do.

01:06:07.844 --> 01:06:09.869
They do very much.

01:06:12.215 --> 01:06:15.514
The love my baby's gotten
has been as much yours as mine.

01:06:19.289 --> 01:06:21.348
Probably more.

01:06:28.298 --> 01:06:30.357
Where's my little boy?

01:06:33.536 --> 01:06:35.868
What's he doing?

01:06:40.176 --> 01:06:44.169
lf he were home,
he'd be going down for his nap.

01:09:46.595 --> 01:09:48.894
l got bad news.

01:09:48.965 --> 01:09:51.091
The kid's...

01:09:52.100 --> 01:09:54.160
in there.

01:09:54.670 --> 01:09:56.729
No, wait. Eddie, there's a guard.

01:09:56.873 --> 01:09:59.774
Eddie, no. Eddie, wait. No.

01:09:59.876 --> 01:10:03.141
- There's a guard.
- He's asleep, you moron.

01:10:05.348 --> 01:10:10.081
Where is he? Come on,
knucklehead. Where is he, huh?

01:10:16.792 --> 01:10:18.885
Of course.

01:10:19.161 --> 01:10:21.288
Where else would he be?

01:10:26.269 --> 01:10:28.328
Let's go get him.

01:10:59.135 --> 01:11:01.399
Eddie.

01:11:01.504 --> 01:11:03.495
Baby, 12 o'clock.

01:11:07.443 --> 01:11:09.035
Up there.

01:11:15.184 --> 01:11:17.880
We'll be with you in just a minute.

01:11:23.993 --> 01:11:28.157
Lingerie, home furnishings,
men's hats, babies.

01:11:30.466 --> 01:11:35.062
- Wait a minute. We passed him.
- Yes, moron. We'll grab him as he goes by.

01:11:35.137 --> 01:11:38.937
Yeah, that's a good plan, Ed.
We grab him as he comes by.

01:11:39.008 --> 01:11:41.101
You grab him.

01:11:41.877 --> 01:11:43.936
- l grab him?
- Right.

01:11:45.114 --> 01:11:48.481
As the girder comes up,
you jump out on it and grab the baby.

01:11:48.551 --> 01:11:52.715
- Me? By myself?
- You just step out on it. lt ain't difficult.

01:11:53.222 --> 01:11:55.952
- Why me?
- Norby's scared of heights.

01:11:56.092 --> 01:11:58.652
- Why don't you grab him?
- Nobody asked me!

01:12:08.337 --> 01:12:11.306
OK, OK. That's it.

01:12:11.374 --> 01:12:13.638
- Come on, don't miss him.
- l'll get it.

01:12:13.709 --> 01:12:15.768
Don't miss it. He's coming.

01:12:17.446 --> 01:12:22.509
- All right. Don't grab, OK?
- l'm not touching you. There it is. Go!

01:12:34.296 --> 01:12:36.287
Here he comes.

01:12:40.369 --> 01:12:42.735
How'd he do that?

01:12:44.140 --> 01:12:46.199
Baby luck.

01:12:59.622 --> 01:13:02.056
Eddie! Help me!

01:13:03.726 --> 01:13:07.093
- He asked for you, Ed.
- He ain't thinkin' straight.

01:13:07.163 --> 01:13:09.461
- Don't look down.
- What are you doin'?

01:13:09.532 --> 01:13:13.969
- Eddie, no! l'm gonna faint!
- Didn't l tell you not to look down?

01:13:14.070 --> 01:13:16.436
- Pull me back, please!
- l'm losing my grip.

01:13:16.505 --> 01:13:19.338
- Pull me back, please.
- Grab him by the leg.

01:13:19.442 --> 01:13:21.706
Grab him by the leg or l'll let you go!

01:13:21.777 --> 01:13:24.473
Don't look down.

01:13:24.547 --> 01:13:26.538
OK, good. You got him.

01:13:31.587 --> 01:13:33.020
Up!

01:13:36.125 --> 01:13:38.889
You're going the wrong way! Come up!

01:13:38.961 --> 01:13:41.794
- Rest on my feet.
- l could use a hand here!

01:13:41.897 --> 01:13:44.889
Hey, quit being a crybaby. Get up.

01:13:50.406 --> 01:13:53.307
You're doin' good, but you gotta get back up.

01:13:53.375 --> 01:13:55.775
- l'm losin' him, Eddie.
- Quit foolin' around.

01:13:55.878 --> 01:13:57.539
Gimme a hand.

01:14:01.283 --> 01:14:02.716
What's the matter with you?

01:14:17.032 --> 01:14:18.522
Ed?

01:14:20.736 --> 01:14:23.227
- Eddie?
- Get off of me.

01:14:32.782 --> 01:14:35.273
There he is.

01:14:35.351 --> 01:14:37.876
Come on, we'll take the stairs.

01:15:33.676 --> 01:15:35.871
lt's comin' back down. Get ready.

01:15:39.348 --> 01:15:42.283
- Now, jump.
- l'll wait for another.

01:15:42.351 --> 01:15:44.512
No, don't wait. Jump.

01:15:44.653 --> 01:15:46.712
Jump!

01:16:13.349 --> 01:16:15.214
My...

01:16:15.284 --> 01:16:17.149
spine.

01:17:27.523 --> 01:17:30.253
- l lived.
- Get back up here!

01:17:38.667 --> 01:17:41.295
Come here, you little ball of grief!

01:17:44.173 --> 01:17:48.132
Now l gotcha! You ain't
gonna crawl away from this one.

01:18:17.940 --> 01:18:19.498
That hurt!

01:18:53.742 --> 01:18:55.642
That's it!

01:18:56.512 --> 01:18:59.242
No mercy!

01:19:03.619 --> 01:19:08.921
This ain't no nursery-school
battle of wits anymore.

01:19:09.224 --> 01:19:14.662
This is my five foot, ten inches
of guile, gut and gristle

01:19:14.730 --> 01:19:20.430
versus your two and a half feet
of goo-goos, ga-gas and giggles.

01:19:24.606 --> 01:19:27.404
lf the Mil...

01:19:34.716 --> 01:19:37.514
lf the Milwaukee Mob couldn't kill me,

01:19:37.619 --> 01:19:43.717
no milk-puking little thumb-sucker's
got a candle's chance in a cyclone

01:19:43.826 --> 01:19:46.056
of gettin' the better of me.

01:19:51.266 --> 01:19:53.325
Where are you going?

01:19:57.473 --> 01:19:59.338
Come back here.

01:20:02.377 --> 01:20:05.744
This isn't funny anymore.

01:20:08.984 --> 01:20:11.452
My money!

01:22:11.974 --> 01:22:13.669
What?

01:22:13.742 --> 01:22:16.540
l thought l saw a baby
crawl around the corner.

01:22:18.847 --> 01:22:20.906
Good night, Donald.

01:22:57.152 --> 01:22:59.211
Norby!

01:23:00.355 --> 01:23:02.346
Veeko!

01:23:03.825 --> 01:23:07.056
Ed! We're down here!

01:23:14.970 --> 01:23:17.063
Hey, Ed!

01:23:19.074 --> 01:23:21.508
We better go before l dry!

01:23:22.444 --> 01:23:25.379
Ed, can you see the baby from up there?

01:23:26.348 --> 01:23:30.284
Just hang on and we'll come on up.
l got an idea.

01:23:41.063 --> 01:23:44.999
We got some news. l don't know
if it's good, but it's not bad.

01:23:45.100 --> 01:23:47.967
Since the media broke the story,
calls have come in.

01:23:48.170 --> 01:23:51.731
There was a report of a man
looking for a baby on a bus this morning.

01:23:52.107 --> 01:23:55.372
A baby missing from
a department store care center.

01:23:56.678 --> 01:23:59.476
Another, at three o'clock, at the zoo.

01:23:59.548 --> 01:24:03.484
Shortly after that at a downtown park.
And a final report not long ago at...

01:24:03.552 --> 01:24:07.113
- A building under construction.
- Yeah, that's right.

01:24:09.691 --> 01:24:11.955
He's doing everything in the book.

01:24:16.898 --> 01:24:18.957
l know where he is.

01:24:20.068 --> 01:24:22.434
''Before returning home for supper,

01:24:22.504 --> 01:24:28.170
Nanny and Baby Boo stopped at
the Old Soldiers' Home to visit Mr Tinsel.''

01:24:28.276 --> 01:24:30.744
That's where he is.

01:25:28.036 --> 01:25:30.095
Come on over.

01:25:31.273 --> 01:25:34.242
lt's the kid, on television! The one that...

01:25:39.781 --> 01:25:42.579
Come on. That's it. Come on.

01:25:58.600 --> 01:26:02.468
~ This is the army, Mr Jones

01:26:02.537 --> 01:26:06.496
~ No private rooms or telephones

01:26:06.608 --> 01:26:10.044
~ You had your breakfast in bed before

01:26:10.111 --> 01:26:14.707
~ But you won't get it there anymore

01:26:14.816 --> 01:26:18.616
~ This is the army, Mr Brown

01:26:18.687 --> 01:26:22.020
~ You and your baby went to town

01:26:22.491 --> 01:26:26.018
~ She had you worried, but this is war

01:26:26.094 --> 01:26:30.121
~ And she won't worry you anymore

01:26:30.332 --> 01:26:33.961
~ No, she won't worry you

01:26:34.069 --> 01:26:37.835
~ Anymore

01:26:55.056 --> 01:26:57.115
Baby.

01:27:20.448 --> 01:27:22.746
You had quite an adventure today.

01:27:22.851 --> 01:27:24.716
Boo-boo.

01:27:27.522 --> 01:27:31.515
- Boo-boo?
- lt's what he calls his book. He lost it today.

01:27:31.626 --> 01:27:35.084
We'll get you another one, sweetheart.

01:27:38.233 --> 01:27:39.564
What?

01:27:41.536 --> 01:27:43.265
What?

01:27:43.338 --> 01:27:46.000
Oh, l see. That's nice.

01:27:47.475 --> 01:27:50.672
That's not a boo-boo.
That's a clock. A ticktock.

01:27:50.745 --> 01:27:53.771
- Was there a ticktock in his book?
- No.

01:27:56.351 --> 01:27:58.911
Well, he's pointing to...

01:28:00.722 --> 01:28:05.056
His boo-boo. He's not pointing
at the ticktock. He wants his boo-boo.

01:28:05.126 --> 01:28:10.029
- l thought he was getting a new boo-boo.
- He means his boo-boo's back there.

01:28:11.666 --> 01:28:17.263
Radio Rogers and McCloskey. Tell them we're
going to the ticktock to get the boo-boo.

01:28:17.339 --> 01:28:19.239
And send for backup.

01:29:12.027 --> 01:29:17.522
Hey, Eddie, you sure you don't wanna
go check to see if they left the money?

01:29:17.632 --> 01:29:20.192
Oh, that's a good idea.

01:29:20.268 --> 01:29:23.533
We get the living hell
tore out of us by a baby!

01:29:23.705 --> 01:29:28.472
Three fully grown men versus
15 pounds of pink flesh with a mouth.

01:29:28.743 --> 01:29:34.443
What chance have we got of strolling into
that alley and coming out with anything less

01:29:34.516 --> 01:29:37.041
- than 140 years in prison?
- No way.

01:29:37.118 --> 01:29:39.211
No, thank you!

01:29:39.287 --> 01:29:43.724
This is a hexed situation.
We walk away while we're still ahead.

01:29:43.825 --> 01:29:46.658
We took a lickin' and kept on tickin'.

01:29:46.728 --> 01:29:48.457
We'll go back to banks.

01:29:48.730 --> 01:29:52.131
Dealing with grownups.
l don't want no kiddy stuff.

01:29:52.233 --> 01:29:56.567
- We did all right with banks.
- Or a convenience store once in a while.

01:29:56.671 --> 01:30:03.668
You know, one thing l learned from all this:
l ain't never gonna have any kids of my own.

01:30:05.780 --> 01:30:11.241
Yeah, seeing as you burnt down the only tree
in your forest, l wouldn't worry about it.

01:30:13.655 --> 01:30:15.452
Why don't you shut up?

01:30:15.924 --> 01:30:20.918
l don't wanna ever hear another word
about that rotten, snake-bit baby.

01:30:23.465 --> 01:30:25.126
l'm serious!

01:30:30.472 --> 01:30:33.066
l'm hearing that little vermin in my thoughts.

01:30:33.141 --> 01:30:35.575
l wanna erase him from my mind.

01:30:38.413 --> 01:30:40.540
Did you hear that?

01:30:41.483 --> 01:30:44.577
- Yeah.
- You know what it sounds like?

01:31:02.771 --> 01:31:05.137
He's back.

01:31:27.862 --> 01:31:30.558
You dirty, no-good little stool pigeon!

01:31:30.665 --> 01:31:34.066
You're surrounded. Throw down the boo-boo.

01:31:38.973 --> 01:31:41.669
And put your hands over your heads.

01:32:25.253 --> 01:32:27.312
This is the end of the story.

01:32:53.948 --> 01:32:55.882
Good night, sweetheart.

01:32:56.551 --> 01:32:58.610
Good night, Bink.

01:33:06.694 --> 01:33:10.960
Did l tell you? The baby's
having his picture taken tomorrow,

01:33:11.065 --> 01:33:14.034
- Say hello to old Willy,
- l will,

01:38:33.454 --> 01:38:35.854
