&lrm;[sigh of relief] That was close.

&lrm;What you did for Alya
&lrm;was very cool, Marinette

00:46.160 --> 00:48.640
&lrm;You think?
&lrm;I'd have liked to do more but...

00:56.800 --> 00:58.400
&lrm;Hide, Tikki, quick.

00:59.240 --> 01:02.480
&lrm;Girl, you will not believe
&lrm;what just happened to me!

01:02.880 --> 01:05.480
&lrm;Ladybug saved some workers
&lrm;from a villain.

01:05.640 --> 01:08.560
&lrm;Millions of reporters
&lrm;were waiting to interview her.

01:08.920 --> 01:11.160

&lrm;awesome!

01:41.640 --> 01:43.600
&lrm;Yeah, that's... awesome.

&lrm;Let me grab my laptop.

01:47.600 --> 01:51.040
&lrm;You're right, Tikki.
&lrm;I think it made her a little happy.

01:51.200 --> 01:53.360

&lrm;-OK, but fast.

&lrm;Tell me I didn't just do that.

02:05.400 --> 02:06.840
&lrm;You didn't just do that.

02:08.400 --> 02:10.880
&lrm;OK, you did.
&lrm;At least you didn't drop it.

02:11.039 --> 02:12.840
&lrm;I really screwed up this time.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.680
&lrm;Alya's gonna kill me.

02:14.840 --> 02:17.880
&lrm;It's not the end of the world.
&lrm;Alya will understand.

02:18.040 --> 02:19.680
&lrm;She is your best friend.

&lrm;Say hello to Alya, Jacques.

02:39.080 --> 02:41.600
&lrm;What's the name of the play is,
&lrm;Mr. Haprele?

02:41.760 --> 02:42.680
&lrm;It's...

02:42.840 --> 02:45.720
&lrm;It's called, "The Mime's
&lrm;Extraordinary Adventures"

02:45.880 --> 02:49.520
&lrm;starring the most talented
&lrm;awesome actor and mime.

02:49.680 --> 02:50.720
&lrm;Come on now...

02:50.880 --> 02:52.080
&lrm;My father!

02:52.240 --> 02:54.480
&lrm;Give it up for Fred Haprele.

02:54.880 --> 02:56.760
&lrm;Thank you. Thank you, Mylene.

02:57.160 --> 02:59.920
&lrm;Well, congratulations.
&lrm;She must be very proud.

03:00.720 --> 03:03.280
&lrm;All I need is my hat
&lrm;to complete my costume.

03:03.880 --> 03:04.880
&lrm;Here it is.

03:05.040 --> 03:07.560
&lrm;Thank you, Marinette,
&lrm;saving me at the last minute.

03:17.360 --> 03:19.080
&lrm;[Marinette giggles]

03:21.080 --> 03:23.720
&lrm;I don't think
&lrm;Mylene was exaggerating at all.

03:24.160 --> 03:25.120
&lrm;Thank you.

03:25.280 --> 03:26.520
&lrm;I fixed the tear in it.

03:26.680 --> 03:28.800
&lrm;I also sewed the pocket
&lrm;on the inside.

03:29.200 --> 03:30.160
&lrm;That's perfect.

03:30.320 --> 03:31.080
&lrm;Thanks to you,

&lrm;-I had to get my hat.
&lrm;-<i>&lrm;I need you now!</i>

&lrm;I know.

03:46.200 --> 03:48.880
&lrm;The bus leaves in half an hour.
&lrm;I'll be there.

03:49.680 --> 03:51.360
&lrm;That was the play's director.

03:51.520 --> 03:53.120
&lrm;She's nervous about the premiere.

03:53.280 --> 03:56.000
&lrm;She's ready to blow a fuse.
&lrm;I better get going.

03:56.160 --> 03:59.000
&lrm;-See you tonight, girls.
&lrm;-We can't wait.

03:59.160 --> 04:00.240
&lrm;Love you, dad.

04:02.560 --> 04:04.360
&lrm;What's his excuse this time?

04:04.520 --> 04:08.040
&lrm;He said had to get his hat
&lrm;from a repair shop.

04:08.680 --> 04:10.560
&lrm;Well, he's a convincing actor.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.840
&lrm;Actually, he is a great actor,

04:13.000 --> 04:15.240
&lrm;but he makes excuses for being late...

04:15.400 --> 04:17.399
&lrm;For falling asleep during rehearsals.

04:17.560 --> 04:18.839
&lrm;for leaving early,

04:19.000 --> 04:21.240
&lrm;for missing parts of his costume.

04:21.680 --> 04:24.360
&lrm;Come on, Sarah,
&lrm;when are you going to wake up?

04:24.800 --> 04:27.040
&lrm;But it's up to you
&lrm;if you want the show to suffer.

04:27.480 --> 04:29.160
&lrm;Look, you're his understudy.

04:29.320 --> 04:31.920
&lrm;Be ready to replace him
&lrm;just in case, okay?

04:32.520 --> 04:34.240
&lrm;I won't let you down, Sarah.

04:34.400 --> 04:35.960
&lrm;Thanks.

04:36.120 --> 04:37.360
&lrm;[he chuckles]

04:41.680 --> 04:45.240

&lrm;I want to change before the show.

&lrm;Hey, that's my ringtone.

04:48.320 --> 04:50.960
&lrm;[Marinette giggles nervously]

04:51.120 --> 04:52.320
&lrm;Gimme.

04:54.400 --> 04:56.200
&lrm;It's my mom, I'll call her back.

04:56.360 --> 04:59.600
&lrm;Mylene, you wanna see a cool video?

04:59.760 --> 05:01.160
&lrm;No!

05:01.600 --> 05:05.000
&lrm;You wouldn't want her to be late
&lrm;for her dad's show.

05:05.520 --> 05:07.560
&lrm;Marinette's right, I gotta go.

05:07.720 --> 05:09.080
&lrm;OK, I'll go with you

05:09.240 --> 05:10.440
&lrm;and show you on the way.

&lrm;No, it's Chris.

05:27.840 --> 05:30.400
&lrm;Sarah asked me to call you
&lrm;about a location change.

05:30.560 --> 05:33.800
&lrm;The bus is picking us up
&lrm;in 10 minutes at the Louvre.

05:33.960 --> 05:36.160
&lrm;That's on the other side of town.

05:36.320 --> 05:39.120
&lrm;Yes, but it's closer
&lrm;to the Eiffel Tower.

05:39.280 --> 05:42.160
&lrm;Well... OK.
&lrm;Luckily, I'll just make it on time.

05:42.320 --> 05:43.680
&lrm;Thanks for telling me.

05:43.840 --> 05:45.360
&lrm;Sure, see you there.

&lrm;OK, see you.

05:53.960 --> 05:56.920
&lrm;Wait, I have to show you
&lrm;my awesome vid...

05:58.040 --> 05:59.120
&lrm;Where's my phone?

05:59.680 --> 06:01.640
&lrm;You stole Alya's phone?

06:02.640 --> 06:04.120
&lrm;I... I borrowed it.

06:05.200 --> 06:08.200
&lrm;Look, all I need to do is
&lrm;transform into Ladybug

06:08.360 --> 06:11.280
&lrm;and film myself doing
&lrm;the exact same thing.

06:11.440 --> 06:12.720
&lrm;Then I'll give it back.

06:13.080 --> 06:16.280
&lrm;I don't know.
&lrm;Maybe it's better to come clean now.

06:16.440 --> 06:18.880
&lrm;You might be digging a bigger hole.

06:19.040 --> 06:20.400
&lrm;I can handle this.

06:20.560 --> 06:22.960

&lrm;OK, I'll give it to you at the show.

&lrm;See ya.

&lrm;Don't look at me like that.
&lrm;It'll all work out,

&lrm;You're right, Chris. Let's go.

07:17.480 --> 07:19.000
&lrm;You'll take Fred's place.

&lrm;the meeting place changed.

&lrm;-I don't care.

10:08.520 --> 10:11.560
&lrm;If you're ticked off.
&lrm;We can talk about it.

10:11.720 --> 10:12.680
&lrm;Or not.

10:14.400 --> 10:16.080
&lrm;[arrows whistle]

10:17.600 --> 10:19.360
&lrm;[Nathalie] <i>&lrm;Yes, sir, understood.</i>

10:19.520 --> 10:21.720
&lrm;I'm sure he'll understand, sir.

10:22.680 --> 10:24.400
&lrm;My dad's flaking, isn't he?

10:24.560 --> 10:26.200
&lrm;Let me guess,
&lrm;something came up.

10:26.360 --> 10:30.120
&lrm;Yes, but he reserved
&lrm;the best seats in the house.

10:30.280 --> 10:32.560
&lrm;As usual, the best money can buy.

10:32.680 --> 10:33.520
&lrm;[gasping]

10:35.120 --> 10:36.400
&lrm;Get out and hide.

10:36.560 --> 10:37.480
&lrm;I'll cover you.

10:39.040 --> 10:40.400
&lrm;[romantic music]

10:41.240 --> 10:43.480
&lrm;[arrows whistle]

10:48.360 --> 10:50.160
&lrm;We've gotta transform now.

10:50.320 --> 10:52.680
&lrm;I thought I was a spectator,
&lrm;not a performer.

10:52.840 --> 10:54.240
&lrm;-What about the show?
&lrm;-No time.

10:54.400 --> 10:56.280
&lrm;Plagg, claws out!

11:17.560 --> 11:19.640
&lrm;[clicking]

11:20.640 --> 11:22.560
&lrm;[clinking]

11:29.680 --> 11:32.600
&lrm;Grab her Miraculous, her earrings, now!

11:32.920 --> 11:34.480
&lrm;[rope creaks]

11:37.920 --> 11:39.840
&lrm;Keep your hands to yourself.

11:40.320 --> 11:42.200
&lrm;It's OK, I've got this.

11:42.360 --> 11:43.960
&lrm;My pleasure, Cat Noir.

11:46.120 --> 11:47.960
&lrm;[clinking]

11:52.840 --> 11:55.280
&lrm;Apparently, not seeing is believing.

11:55.440 --> 11:57.280
&lrm;We can't let him go like that.

11:57.960 --> 11:59.000
&lrm;[bleeping]

12:00.360 --> 12:01.920
&lrm;[car door opens and shuts]

12:02.480 --> 12:03.600
&lrm;[car starts]

12:04.600 --> 12:05.840
&lrm;No, wait!

12:09.040 --> 12:11.040
&lrm;-There, I did it.
&lrm;-I wish you did.

12:11.640 --> 12:14.720
&lrm;When he started miming the car,
&lrm;the bars disappeared.

12:15.760 --> 12:16.760
&lrm;Hey, wait.

12:22.080 --> 12:24.840
&lrm;Nice ride
&lrm;but I'd have made it a convertible.

12:25.640 --> 12:26.840
&lrm;[car accelerates]

12:28.960 --> 12:32.320
&lrm;He's one of the actors
&lrm;and he's after that bus.

12:34.040 --> 12:35.720
&lrm;Where is he going?

12:36.120 --> 12:37.560
&lrm;We've gotta stop him.

12:37.720 --> 12:38.920
&lrm;-Hit the brakes.
&lrm;-What brakes?

12:39.880 --> 12:40.800
&lrm;[screams]

12:40.960 --> 12:42.440
&lrm;[tires screech]

12:43.520 --> 12:45.680
&lrm;Not bad for driving an invisible car

12:45.840 --> 12:49.040
&lrm;but they'll never believe
&lrm;we saved their lives.

12:49.200 --> 12:52.040
&lrm;[clicking]

12:52.200 --> 12:54.360
&lrm;[motorbike revs up]

12:58.080 --> 12:59.320
&lrm;He's off again.

12:59.480 --> 13:01.920
&lrm;We've got to catch up with the bus.

13:02.320 --> 13:03.560
&lrm;What are you doing?

13:03.720 --> 13:05.800
&lrm;Good thing you have friends
&lrm;in high places.

13:05.960 --> 13:08.040
&lrm;-Hold on.
&lrm;-I could've done this.

13:08.200 --> 13:11.240
&lrm;-We're the Cat and Bug team.
&lrm;-Bug and Cat team.

13:11.400 --> 13:12.680
&lrm;Drop me off there.

13:13.120 --> 13:14.200
&lrm;Get ready.

13:18.560 --> 13:20.880
&lrm;-Where's the Akuma?
&lrm;-In his hat.

13:21.040 --> 13:23.760
&lrm;-How do you know?
&lrm;-I have hidden talents.

13:23.920 --> 13:25.440
&lrm;[engine accelerates]

13:29.840 --> 13:33.720
&lrm;[dramatic music]

13:33.880 --> 13:34.960
&lrm;[sword clinks]

13:35.360 --> 13:36.640
&lrm;-Distract him.
&lrm;-Gotcha!

13:37.360 --> 13:38.240
&lrm;Meow.

13:48.800 --> 13:50.360
&lrm;[he gasps] Fred?

13:51.800 --> 13:53.680
&lrm;The Miraculous. Grab her earring!

13:57.080 --> 13:58.840
&lrm;-Grab his hat.
&lrm;-Look out!

14:04.360 --> 14:05.440
&lrm;[chainsaw whirrs]

14:05.720 --> 14:08.160
&lrm;[grinding]

14:12.600 --> 14:15.320
&lrm;-We have to get them to safety.
&lrm;-Can I lend a paw?

14:15.480 --> 14:16.680
&lrm;Yeah, cover me.

14:16.840 --> 14:17.960
&lrm;Hurry up, Milady.

14:18.320 --> 14:19.360
&lrm;[tapping]

14:20.560 --> 14:21.320
&lrm;Stop.

14:21.760 --> 14:22.880
&lrm;What's happening?

14:23.040 --> 14:24.440
&lrm;An actor has been akumatised,

14:24.600 --> 14:26.800
&lrm;and he seems to have it in
&lrm;for your troupe.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.040
&lrm;Fred?

14:31.160 --> 14:32.760
&lrm;[arrows whistle]

14:38.160 --> 14:40.760
&lrm;[screaming]

14:48.960 --> 14:50.400
&lrm;Stay inside.

14:50.560 --> 14:51.800
&lrm;We'll get this under control.

14:51.960 --> 14:54.640
&lrm;I know why he's after us.
&lrm;I stole his role

14:54.800 --> 14:57.160
&lrm;but he can have it back,
&lrm;I don't care anymore.

14:57.320 --> 14:58.400
&lrm;Just keep us safe.

14:58.560 --> 15:02.000
&lrm;What do you mean?
&lrm;You didn't steal it, he lost it.

15:02.160 --> 15:04.800
&lrm;Not exactly,
&lrm;I have to tell you something.

15:26.960 --> 15:29.440
&lrm;His Miraculous, I want his ring!

15:35.120 --> 15:36.640
&lrm;I don't know why you're so violent

15:36.800 --> 15:38.880
&lrm;but I don't think Mylene would approve.

15:43.040 --> 15:43.920
&lrm;[bleep]

15:49.400 --> 15:51.720
&lrm;That's what I call "silent but deadly".

15:53.280 --> 15:54.280
&lrm;Lucky charm!

16:01.120 --> 16:02.640
&lrm;A shoe box? Great.

16:02.800 --> 16:04.600
&lrm;There better be explosive boots in there.

16:13.600 --> 16:14.560
&lrm;Of course,

16:14.720 --> 16:17.560
&lrm;we have to make him really angry.

16:18.080 --> 16:19.000
&lrm;Blow his fuse!

16:19.160 --> 16:20.320
&lrm;Isn't he angry enough?

16:20.480 --> 16:23.160
&lrm;You're good at annoying people.
&lrm;Do your thing.

16:23.560 --> 16:24.640
&lrm;Hey...

16:24.800 --> 16:25.960
&lrm;That is true.

16:26.520 --> 16:27.720
&lrm;Gotta borrow these.

16:29.280 --> 16:31.400
&lrm;A box, a magnifying glass,

16:31.560 --> 16:33.120
&lrm;some light, and voilà!

16:33.400 --> 16:35.320
&lrm;A homemade projector. Hey, Mime!

16:35.480 --> 16:37.640
&lrm;Nice poster, don't you think?

17:00.400 --> 17:02.720
&lrm;[screaming]

17:12.800 --> 17:15.839
&lrm;Yes! Remember he can only mime
&lrm;one thing at a time.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.400
&lrm;So he's cornered.
&lrm;Good thinking, Milady.

17:19.480 --> 17:20.560
&lrm;Thanks.

17:29.680 --> 17:31.160
&lrm;No more evil-doing for you, Akuma.

17:35.320 --> 17:37.320
&lrm;Time to de-evilise.

17:40.560 --> 17:41.640
&lrm;Gotcha!

17:43.040 --> 17:44.520
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly.

17:45.400 --> 17:47.040
&lrm;Miraculous Ladybug!

17:52.040 --> 17:53.200
&lrm;[he gasps] Yes!

17:57.720 --> 18:00.080
&lrm;What happened? How did I get here?

18:00.240 --> 18:01.440
&lrm;POUND IT!

18:02.760 --> 18:04.640
&lrm;I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

18:04.800 --> 18:05.800
&lrm;I'm sorry too.

18:05.960 --> 18:09.640
&lrm;I was so desperate to perform
&lrm;that I lied to you.

18:13.680 --> 18:15.320
&lrm;[bleeping] Your earrings.

18:15.480 --> 18:16.560
&lrm;Better get going.

18:16.720 --> 18:19.320
&lrm;Shame, I could have been
&lrm;your date to the play.

18:19.480 --> 18:22.680
&lrm;-Just you and me.
&lrm;-Thanks, but I have other plans.

18:32.000 --> 18:35.200
&lrm;The show's not over yet, Ladybug.
&lrm;You just wait.

18:35.360 --> 18:39.800
&lrm;There's still a last act to come
&lrm;when you least expect it.

18:49.880 --> 18:50.760
&lrm;Got it!

18:57.920 --> 18:58.760
&lrm;[Adrien] Hey.

18:59.040 --> 19:00.160
&lrm;You're here, cool.

19:00.520 --> 19:02.160
&lrm;I thought I'd end up alone.

19:02.320 --> 19:04.240
&lrm;[Alya] Did you bring my phone?

19:07.720 --> 19:12.480
&lrm;[cheering]

19:17.360 --> 19:20.760
&lrm;I don't know which I liked more,
&lrm;the show or Adrien.

19:21.440 --> 19:24.160
&lrm;Give him a call
&lrm;and ask him out to a movie.

19:24.320 --> 19:26.760
&lrm;Speaking of calling
&lrm;I've something to tell you.

19:28.480 --> 19:31.280
&lrm;I... accidentally erased
&lrm;your Ladybug video,

19:31.440 --> 19:34.200
&lrm;then I dropped your phone in a bin,

19:34.360 --> 19:37.880
&lrm;and now it stinks,
&lrm;like really really bad...

19:38.040 --> 19:41.040
&lrm;and I'm sorry, so so sorry.

19:41.200 --> 19:43.080
&lrm;I know that video meant a lot.

19:43.240 --> 19:44.640
&lrm;I'm a lame friend.

19:44.920 --> 19:47.200
&lrm;[she giggles] Chillax, lady.

19:47.600 --> 19:50.520
&lrm;If anyone knows
&lrm;about your legendary clumsiness,

19:50.680 --> 19:52.120
&lrm;it's me, your BFF.

19:52.840 --> 19:54.960
&lrm;So... You're not angry?

19:55.520 --> 20:00.600
&lrm;Well... you should have come clean
&lrm;and told me, but no, we're cool.

20:00.760 --> 20:03.360
&lrm;Besides, I'd already uploaded it
&lrm;to my blog.

20:03.680 --> 20:05.840
&lrm;I'm so lucky
&lrm;to have a friend like you.

20:06.000 --> 20:09.120
&lrm;So you probably don't care
&lrm;about my surprise.

20:10.400 --> 20:13.640
&lrm;Screw up or no screw up,
&lrm;you know I love surprises.

20:14.080 --> 20:15.760
&lrm;Ok. You see that theatre?

20:15.920 --> 20:19.000
&lrm;There's something inside for you,
&lrm;on the stage.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.640
&lrm;Hello, Alya right?

20:27.040 --> 20:28.760
&lrm;Last time, I was in a hurry.

20:28.920 --> 20:31.960
&lrm;I've got more time now
&lrm;if you want to interview me.

20:32.280 --> 20:35.280
&lrm;[she gasps] No? Seriously?

20:35.640 --> 20:37.040
&lrm;Do I? Do I!

20:37.400 --> 20:38.480
&lrm;Have a seat.

20:38.880 --> 20:42.040
&lrm;You don't know me but FYI, this is like

20:42.200 --> 20:44.240
<i>&lrm;the biggest moment of my life.</i>

20:50.000 --> 20:52.280
&lrm;Alya's lucky to have you
&lrm;as a friend too.

20:56.680 --> 20:59.680
&lrm;-Well? Show me!
&lrm;-Only after I've put it on my blog.

20:59.840 --> 21:02.040
&lrm;-I'm not gonna lose this video.
&lrm;-Hey!

21:03.120 --> 21:06.480
&lrm;[giggling]
