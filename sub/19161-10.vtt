00:00.961 --> 00:02.212
<i>Previously on Riverdale...</i>

00:02.420 --> 00:04.631
They're ruining our lives,
and to them it's just a game.

00:04.839 --> 00:06.841
<i>They keep score
in some secret playbook.</i>

00:07.050 --> 00:08.718
You want vengeance?
I'm with you.

00:08.927 --> 00:11.471
- And I have a plan.
- You like shaming
people, Chuck?

00:11.680 --> 00:13.431
Apologize for ruining Polly.

00:13.640 --> 00:15.350
- What the hell?
- Do it, Jason!

00:15.558 --> 00:18.103
- Apologize for what
you did to me!
- Look, I'm not Jason!

00:19.604 --> 00:20.647
This is our insurance.

00:20.855 --> 00:23.400
Here, stash it. Keep it safe.

00:23.608 --> 00:25.652
Hermione Lodge will crumble.

00:25.860 --> 00:27.570
Maybe you should've sent her
to jail instead of Hiram.

00:27.779 --> 00:29.197
I heard
Mr. and Mrs. Blossom talking.

00:29.406 --> 00:31.074
<i>It sounded like
Clifford Blossom
was responsible</i>

00:31.282 --> 00:32.826
<i>for sending
Veronica's dad to jail.</i>

00:33.034 --> 00:34.494
Ever since we started
dating you've ignored me,

00:34.703 --> 00:36.204
- you've ditched me.
- Let me make it up to you.

00:36.413 --> 00:38.123
Sorry, Archie,
but I won't be bought.

00:38.331 --> 00:39.541
The lawyers
are coming over this week

00:39.749 --> 00:41.292
to take our statements
for your dad's hearing.

00:41.501 --> 00:42.585
Am I gonna have to lie?

00:42.794 --> 00:44.379
<i>My father is a criminal.</i>

00:49.259 --> 00:50.301
<i>Weekdays,</i>

00:50.510 --> 00:54.848
<i>from 8:25 a.m. to 3:01 p.m.,
we adhere to a strict regimen.</i>

00:55.181 --> 00:57.100
Everything in our
lives is controlled.

00:57.308 --> 01:00.020
<i>But then something
like the murder of
Jason Blossom happens,</i>

01:00.186 --> 01:03.398
<i>and you realize
there is no such thing
as control.</i>

01:03.606 --> 01:05.150
<i>There is only chaos.</i>

01:09.779 --> 01:14.409
<i>Nevertheless, some of us
strive to impose
and maintain order</i>

01:15.368 --> 01:18.371
<i>in what is, fundamentally,
an orderless world.</i>

01:20.999 --> 01:24.127
<i>A fact which would
very soon be confirmed</i>

01:25.295 --> 01:27.213
<i>in ways none of us
could have foreseen.</i>

01:33.303 --> 01:35.013
I'm, uh... I'm headed out.

01:35.221 --> 01:37.140
Sorry to be missing your
birthday this weekend, Jug.

01:37.348 --> 01:40.018
Oh, you will not be missing
anything, Mr. Andrews,

01:40.226 --> 01:42.062
I barely acknowledge
my own birthday.

01:44.189 --> 01:46.316
Arch, can you give me
a hand downstairs?

01:50.195 --> 01:53.448
The good news is that
all these divorce papers

01:53.656 --> 01:55.366
and legal mumbo jumbo
will be done.

01:55.575 --> 01:58.369
Should be behind us
by the end of the week.

01:58.578 --> 01:59.662
Are you only
going to see Mom now

01:59.871 --> 02:01.456
because you
and Hermione Lodge...

02:01.998 --> 02:04.459
No. No, son, I ended that.

02:05.085 --> 02:08.088
Being together,
working together,
not a good idea.

02:08.296 --> 02:09.339
In that case, then,

02:10.757 --> 02:13.927
why finalize things
in such a final way now?

02:14.135 --> 02:17.138
Sometimes, son, you just
gotta rip the Band-Aid off.

02:19.015 --> 02:20.391
Or you can try and fix things.

02:21.559 --> 02:23.228
We're past
that point, Archie.

02:23.436 --> 02:25.980
I spoke to Mom last week,
she didn't mention
any of this, Dad.

02:26.189 --> 02:28.316
Your mom moved out
two years ago.

02:29.109 --> 02:32.445
She didn't tell you
because she wanted me
to be the bearer of bad news.

02:33.863 --> 02:35.115
What if I came with you?

02:36.074 --> 02:37.492
This is between
me and your mom.

02:39.661 --> 02:40.703
I'll check in.

02:50.505 --> 02:51.381
What's going on?

02:51.589 --> 02:55.051
Veronica,
this is Paul Sowerberry,
your father's attorney.

02:55.260 --> 02:56.803
He's here to prep us
for our statements

02:57.011 --> 02:58.096
and help
at your dad's hearing.

02:58.304 --> 03:01.266
Except, I told you, Mom,
I'm not giving one.

03:01.474 --> 03:02.976
- Not one you'd want.
- Just...

03:03.184 --> 03:04.435
You won't be asked
any questions

03:04.644 --> 03:06.646
about your father's
business arrangements.

03:06.855 --> 03:08.982
We just need you
and your mother
to speak to his character.

03:09.190 --> 03:10.275
It'll humanize him.

03:10.483 --> 03:11.985
Which could mean
a lesser sentence.

03:12.193 --> 03:13.194
If you don't make a statement,

03:13.403 --> 03:15.530
well, that's problematic
and damaging.

03:15.738 --> 03:17.490
I've already told her
all of this.

03:17.699 --> 03:20.493
Well, Dad made his bed.
And I'm late for school.

03:21.661 --> 03:24.164
Veronica, there's something
we need to talk to you about.

03:24.372 --> 03:25.206
Bring it.

03:25.415 --> 03:27.709
After the morning I've had,
I'm ready for just about
anything.

03:27.917 --> 03:30.211
Okay, well, Archie
was with the Blossoms.

03:30.420 --> 03:33.423
While their Board
was in town, he, um...

03:34.757 --> 03:36.759
Why don't you tell her?
You were there.

03:38.136 --> 03:40.305
Why is this suddenly feeling
like a friendtervention?

03:40.513 --> 03:42.807
I overheard Mr. Blossom
say he's the one responsible

03:43.016 --> 03:45.268
for your dad being arrested
and put in jail.

03:47.687 --> 03:48.730
Are you kidding?

03:50.190 --> 03:51.357
Why the hell
would Clifford Blossom

03:51.566 --> 03:53.401
have anything to do
with why he's in prison?

03:56.821 --> 03:59.449
Hey, you may
or may not know this,

03:59.657 --> 04:02.744
but it's Jughead's birthday.

04:03.953 --> 04:06.331
What?
And he didn't say anything?

04:06.539 --> 04:09.000
It's tomorrow,
and he doesn't like
making a big deal out of it.

04:09.209 --> 04:11.377
Every year, he goes
to a double feature
at the Bijou.

04:11.586 --> 04:13.004
It's like this tradition.

04:13.713 --> 04:15.715
Last few years,
I've been his movie-buddy.

04:15.924 --> 04:16.799
But now
that he has a girlfriend...

04:17.008 --> 04:18.134
Well, of course,
I'll take him.

04:18.343 --> 04:19.469
But you should
still come with us.

04:19.677 --> 04:20.803
No. I don't wanna
be a third wheel.

04:21.012 --> 04:23.264
Come on.
It'll be like old times.

04:23.473 --> 04:24.724
The Three Musketeers.

04:25.516 --> 04:30.063
Actually, Archie,
there were four Musketeers.

04:30.271 --> 04:31.648
I'll see you later, Betty.

04:31.856 --> 04:32.774
Okay.

04:34.275 --> 04:35.526
<i>Yeah, this is Jones.</i>

04:35.735 --> 04:38.696
<i>Mr. Jones, hi,
this is Betty Cooper.</i>

04:38.905 --> 04:40.949
<i>- Jughead's...</i>
- Girlfriend, yeah, I remember.

04:41.157 --> 04:44.911
Great, well, I'm calling
because it's Jughead's
birthday tomorrow,

04:45.119 --> 04:47.664
and I wanted to see
if maybe you would come

04:47.872 --> 04:50.667
<i>see a movie with us,
maybe grab dinner?</i>

04:51.042 --> 04:52.293
Does he know
you're calling me?

04:52.502 --> 04:55.338
No, I thought
maybe I'd surprise him.

04:55.546 --> 04:57.382
Oh, man.

04:57.590 --> 04:59.259
There's one thing
that Jughead likes less

04:59.467 --> 05:01.302
than surprises,
and that's his birthday.

05:01.511 --> 05:03.513
Kid's never even had a party,
never wanted one...

05:03.721 --> 05:05.515
- What? Never?
<i>- Mmm-hmm.</i>

05:05.723 --> 05:09.352
Anyway, I think the best gift
that I could give to Jughead

05:09.560 --> 05:10.520
would be to stay away.

05:10.728 --> 05:12.188
<i>But I appreciate
the call, Betty.</i>

05:12.897 --> 05:13.856
Okay.

05:16.067 --> 05:18.236
Anyway,
enough about my drama.

05:18.444 --> 05:20.571
Betty, you were saying
something about Jughead's
birthday?

05:20.780 --> 05:22.615
Yeah.
Just that Mr. Jones told me

05:22.824 --> 05:25.201
- Jughead's never had
a birthday party.
- Mmm-hmm.

05:26.202 --> 05:27.578
Let's have one for him.

05:27.787 --> 05:29.414
Like, a low-key
surprise party.

05:29.622 --> 05:31.708
- Uh, no, no.
- That's a fantastic idea.

05:31.916 --> 05:33.084
Jughead doesn't
like his birthday.

05:33.293 --> 05:34.502
Everybody says that,
nobody means it.

05:34.711 --> 05:35.753
Jughead is a lone wolf.

05:35.962 --> 05:37.672
Okay.
Ignoring the negativity.

05:37.880 --> 05:38.965
Betty, you know me,

05:39.173 --> 05:41.426
- any excuse to wear
a cute party dress.
- Yeah.

05:41.634 --> 05:45.722
Okay, so I'm thinking
a quaint gathering,
inner-circle only.

05:45.930 --> 05:48.683
Oh, my God,
don't turn around.

06:00.403 --> 06:04.032
Holy Chuck,
I think his lats got bigger.

06:04.240 --> 06:06.409
Not that I care,
because he's evil incarnate.

06:06.617 --> 06:07.785
What's Chuck Clayton
doing back?

06:07.994 --> 06:09.287
He got suspended,
not expelled.

06:09.495 --> 06:12.081
Even though he should
have been drawn and quartered
for what he did.

06:12.457 --> 06:13.124
Oh, my God.

06:14.167 --> 06:15.376
Get away from her, Chuck.

06:15.585 --> 06:19.130
Easy. Look, I only came
over here to apologize.

06:19.339 --> 06:20.631
You don't have to go
Dark Betty on me again.

06:20.840 --> 06:22.008
I'm not going!

06:25.303 --> 06:26.888
I'm not going Dark anything.

06:28.473 --> 06:29.724
Ethel, is Chuck bothering you?

06:30.391 --> 06:31.934
You can relax,
Betty, it's fine.

06:32.977 --> 06:35.229
Yeah, Betty, we're fine.

06:35.938 --> 06:38.107
The real question is, are you?

06:53.539 --> 06:55.333
What was he doing?
Accosting her?

06:55.541 --> 06:58.503
No, he was... Apologizing.

06:58.711 --> 06:59.962
Oh, I'm so sure.

07:00.171 --> 07:02.673
Chuck Clayton doesn't have
a contrite bone in his
muscle-bound body.

07:02.882 --> 07:04.550
You know what, can we talk
about something else?

07:04.759 --> 07:06.719
Like... Like Jughead's
surprise party.

07:10.890 --> 07:11.557
Betty?

07:14.185 --> 07:17.021
Look,
there's a lot I can't do,
a lot I can't control.

07:17.230 --> 07:18.189
But I can damn well make sure

07:18.398 --> 07:20.691
my boyfriend has the best
birthday of his life.

07:20.900 --> 07:22.485
Screw it. I'm with Betty.

07:22.693 --> 07:24.278
My dad's away.
We can do it at my house.

07:24.487 --> 07:25.696
We could all use a good time.

07:25.905 --> 07:27.156
Now you're talking
my language.

07:28.116 --> 07:29.075
It's gonna be epic.

07:40.420 --> 07:41.629
Mr. Jones,

07:42.880 --> 07:45.591
I didn't mean to ambush you.

07:45.800 --> 07:47.969
I know you don't do birthdays,

07:48.177 --> 07:49.804
but Archie and I are having

07:50.012 --> 07:52.473
a few of Jughead's friends
over at Archie's house.

07:52.682 --> 07:56.978
And I bet it would mean
so much to Jughead
if you came.

07:57.145 --> 08:00.231
- Man, you don't quit, do you?
- Rarely, if ever.

08:00.440 --> 08:02.233
I really wanna do
something special for him.

08:02.442 --> 08:03.818
And you being there...

08:04.777 --> 08:05.903
That would be special.

08:09.198 --> 08:10.283
Great news, Betty.

08:10.992 --> 08:13.703
I just had a terrific meeting
with Principal Weatherbee,

08:13.911 --> 08:15.705
who agrees
that the <i>Blue and Gold</i>

08:15.913 --> 08:18.249
can benefit greatly
from my professional guidance

08:18.458 --> 08:20.418
- as your new advisor.
- That's great, Mom.

08:20.626 --> 08:22.003
So what are we working on?

08:22.170 --> 08:24.797
A list of supplies
for Jughead's birthday party.

08:25.006 --> 08:27.467
You're really falling
for this Jones boy,
aren't you?

08:28.009 --> 08:30.970
Mom, when you and Dad
started dating,

08:31.179 --> 08:34.182
did you tell him everything

08:34.682 --> 08:36.017
about yourself?

08:36.225 --> 08:38.769
I sure did,
and I wish I hadn't.

08:38.978 --> 08:40.855
I shared things
with your father,

08:41.063 --> 08:44.317
my secrets, fears, doubts.

08:44.942 --> 08:46.360
And he ended up
using them against me.

08:46.569 --> 08:47.778
What secrets?

08:47.987 --> 08:49.614
Let's just say
that there are some things

08:49.822 --> 08:51.908
about myself that
I struggle with.

08:52.116 --> 08:53.784
I trust Jughead, Mom.

08:53.993 --> 08:56.996
Of course you do.
And you should.

08:57.538 --> 08:59.248
But just not with everything.

09:03.836 --> 09:07.048
So... A John Landis
double feature at the Bijou.

09:07.924 --> 09:10.384
<i>American Werewolf in London</i>
and <i>Animal House.</i>

09:10.551 --> 09:12.178
That's awesome. Except...

09:12.386 --> 09:13.638
You're going
with Betty instead.

09:13.846 --> 09:16.182
You told her
about my birthday?

09:16.390 --> 09:18.559
Dude, come on.
That's a primal betrayal.

09:18.768 --> 09:20.269
Why do you hate
your birthday so much, Jug?

09:21.729 --> 09:23.314
PTSD from when I was a kid.

09:25.399 --> 09:28.194
I don't know.
Things were always
messed up at home.

09:28.402 --> 09:29.570
Usually because of my dad.

09:29.779 --> 09:31.989
And then there was
this arbitrary day,

09:32.615 --> 09:35.868
that we would
just get together and
pretend things were great,

09:36.077 --> 09:37.620
we were normal.

09:38.579 --> 09:40.498
And it just made me feel
really lonely.

09:43.543 --> 09:44.544
What's all this?

09:44.752 --> 09:47.713
Dad's files
from the basement, Mom.

09:47.922 --> 09:49.340
Archie overheard Mr. Blossom

09:49.549 --> 09:50.675
say that he's the one
responsible

09:50.883 --> 09:52.009
for putting Dad in jail.

09:53.010 --> 09:54.387
So I did some digging.

09:54.595 --> 09:56.597
And found this spreadsheet
of monthly payments

09:56.806 --> 09:58.975
from Blossom Maple Farms
to Lodge Industries

09:59.183 --> 10:01.561
until about five months ago,
when they stopped.

10:02.436 --> 10:03.396
When your father was arrested.

10:03.604 --> 10:04.480
There's more.

10:04.689 --> 10:07.567
The payments,
which are significant,
by the way,

10:07.775 --> 10:10.027
have been happening
for 75 years.

10:10.236 --> 10:11.654
That's a ton of money.

10:11.862 --> 10:14.031
What if Clifford
implicated Daddy

10:14.240 --> 10:15.700
to get out of paying
the monthly fee?

10:16.534 --> 10:18.244
I wouldn't put it past
the wig-wearing monster.

10:18.452 --> 10:20.162
- We should tell Dad's lawyers.
- Well, hold on.

10:20.371 --> 10:23.165
If Clifford did orchestrate
your father's arrest,

10:23.374 --> 10:25.042
people might think
that Hiram had something to do

10:25.251 --> 10:26.377
with Jason Blossom's murder.

10:26.794 --> 10:28.045
Ronnie?

10:28.254 --> 10:29.422
You got to let this go.

10:29.630 --> 10:30.631
You don't think Dad could,
in any way,

10:30.840 --> 10:33.926
be responsible for Jason's
murder, do you?

10:34.135 --> 10:36.012
No, honey, look,
don't make things worse

10:36.220 --> 10:38.556
by asking questions
that no one else is asking.

10:39.181 --> 10:42.310
And please, God, do not
bring the Blossoms into this.

10:42.518 --> 10:43.561
And that includes Cheryl.

10:45.313 --> 10:49.150
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

10:49.358 --> 10:51.944
One, two, three, four... Stop.

10:54.864 --> 10:56.073
You're late, Veronica,

10:56.282 --> 10:58.409
we've already reviewed
the new choreography
for Homecoming.

10:58.618 --> 10:59.744
That means
you'll be in the back,
where your presence

10:59.952 --> 11:01.120
will do the least
amount of damage.

11:01.329 --> 11:02.622
With you front and center,
no doubt.

11:02.830 --> 11:03.831
But of course.

11:03.998 --> 11:05.416
I do have the maddest skills
on this squad.

11:05.625 --> 11:07.043
And because you're a Blossom,

11:07.251 --> 11:09.045
we have to accept whatever
you say as gospel truth?

11:09.253 --> 11:12.048
You're welcome
to challenge me, Veronica,
but you'll lose.

11:12.256 --> 11:14.342
We live in a democratic
society, Cheryl.

11:14.550 --> 11:17.678
Let's let the Vixens decide
who's cherry on top.

11:17.887 --> 11:19.388
- Challenge accepted.
- Great.

12:24.704 --> 12:25.996
All those for Cheryl?

12:28.999 --> 12:30.543
All those for Veronica?

12:37.174 --> 12:38.843
Never cross a Lodge.

12:39.885 --> 12:40.636
Come on, girls.

12:46.559 --> 12:49.103
You catatonic bimbos
didn't even vote.

12:49.311 --> 12:52.356
So you stuttering sapheads
are too dim to exercise
your own rights,

12:52.565 --> 12:54.650
and you've got the combined
vocabulary of a baked potato.

12:54.859 --> 12:57.153
Consider this your last
practice as River Vixens,

12:57.361 --> 12:59.530
and your last week
as my social handmaidens.

12:59.739 --> 13:01.657
You're fired on all fronts.

13:02.283 --> 13:04.201
That's all. Shoo, bitches.

13:15.129 --> 13:17.214
- Hey, Dad, what's up?
<i>- Just checking in.</i>

13:17.423 --> 13:19.800
I felt bad we didn't
get the chance to talk more
before I left.

13:20.009 --> 13:22.178
Yeah, well, you kind
of shut me down, Dad.

13:22.386 --> 13:24.513
You seen Mom yet?

13:24.722 --> 13:26.432
No. We were gonna
have dinner, but...

13:26.640 --> 13:27.933
- But what?
- We decided it would be better

13:28.142 --> 13:31.604
to meet tomorrow morning,
with the lawyers.

13:31.812 --> 13:33.272
Right.
'Cause things are so bad,

13:33.481 --> 13:35.524
you can't talk
without a mediator.

13:36.233 --> 13:37.610
Dad, I gotta go, bye.

14:09.475 --> 14:11.519
Okay, so you're the worst.

14:12.895 --> 14:15.689
But it just so happens
that both our archnemesi,

14:15.856 --> 14:18.317
Betty Cooper
and Veronica Lodge,

14:18.526 --> 14:21.111
will be at a little shindig
at that chowderhead
Archie's house.

14:26.575 --> 14:28.953
Wanna team-up for a little
destruction, Chuck?

14:37.127 --> 14:40.005
Mr. Sowerberry,
let me tell you
what I think happened.

14:40.214 --> 14:43.050
The Blossoms agreed to pay
my family a fee in perpetuity.

14:43.634 --> 14:46.011
Clifford Blossom
tried to end this agreement

14:46.220 --> 14:48.806
so he could stop
paying my family
after all these decades.

14:49.014 --> 14:51.976
And when my father,
being my father, refused,

14:52.184 --> 14:54.603
it was Clifford
who called the police
and got him arrested.

14:55.938 --> 14:56.897
That's what I'm thinking.

14:57.189 --> 14:58.732
I can't confirm or deny...

14:58.941 --> 15:01.026
And the reason
this hasn't come out yet

15:01.235 --> 15:04.363
is because it might
make my Dad look
like a murder suspect?

15:04.864 --> 15:07.032
That is our concern, yes.

15:07.575 --> 15:09.618
Have you changed your mind
about making a statement?

15:10.369 --> 15:12.621
If anything,
I'm less inclined.

15:12.830 --> 15:14.331
I told your father
that you were...

15:15.791 --> 15:17.751
Conflicted about helping him.

15:23.632 --> 15:24.717
"My darling daughter.

15:25.175 --> 15:27.386
"If you do not testify
on my behalf,

15:28.053 --> 15:31.056
"I'm afraid your poor mother
might be drawn
into this awful mess.

15:31.265 --> 15:34.560
"It pains me to say,
but she is not nearly
as innocent as you believe.

15:38.731 --> 15:41.400
"Think carefully about
your next move, Veronica.

15:42.109 --> 15:45.070
"The rest of your life,
and your mother's,

15:45.279 --> 15:46.780
"will be decided by it."

15:51.660 --> 15:52.828
Hey,
I was talking to Kevin.

15:53.037 --> 15:54.038
He told me
that you and Chuck

15:54.246 --> 15:57.082
had some scene
in the cafeteria yesterday.

15:57.374 --> 15:58.584
It wasn't a big deal.

16:02.713 --> 16:05.382
What exactly happened
between you guys that night?

16:05.883 --> 16:08.719
Veronica asked me to keep
the details under wraps, okay?

16:10.888 --> 16:13.182
Yeah. All right. No worries.

16:13.390 --> 16:16.977
I only really asked
because you made it sound
like you were upset.

16:17.227 --> 16:19.313
If I was upset about anything,

16:19.521 --> 16:20.856
it was that I had to hear
about your birthday

16:21.065 --> 16:23.025
from Archie and not you, Jug.

16:23.567 --> 16:25.569
Yeah, well...

16:26.278 --> 16:29.198
I didn't think you were
an <i>American Werewolf</i>
kind of girl.

16:29.907 --> 16:32.785
Ooh. That's where
you're wrong, Jughead Jones.

16:32.993 --> 16:34.745
I'm all about
the beast within.

16:37.456 --> 16:40.042
If it's a double feature,
does that mean I have time
to go to the bathroom?

16:40.250 --> 16:41.293
I'd hold it, Ethel.

16:46.715 --> 16:48.092
Surprise!

16:50.761 --> 16:52.763
Do I look like Jughead to you?

16:53.973 --> 16:56.016
Oh. Betty just texted me.
They're almost here.

16:56.225 --> 16:57.518
You've met Joaquin, right?

16:57.685 --> 16:58.811
I haven't had the pleasure.

17:00.104 --> 17:02.898
Also I thought
it was inner-circle only
tonight?

17:03.107 --> 17:05.776
Joaquin's my boyfriend,
that makes him inner-circle.

17:05.985 --> 17:09.697
Uh-huh, well, I just came
from the most insane meeting
with my dad's lawyer.

17:09.905 --> 17:13.075
Between his upcoming hearing
and his potential involvement
in Jason's murder,

17:13.283 --> 17:15.411
not to mention my mom's,
I'm in a foul mood.

17:15.619 --> 17:16.745
Guys, they're really coming
this time.

17:16.954 --> 17:17.746
Everybody hide.

17:18.789 --> 17:20.124
Ugh, I'm so over this.

17:27.381 --> 17:30.342
Surprise!

17:30.551 --> 17:32.970
This is why we left
the double feature.

17:33.429 --> 17:34.596
Happy birthday, bro.

17:34.805 --> 17:36.015
You really shouldn't have.

17:37.141 --> 17:39.977
Ugh, you reek. Are you drunk?

17:40.352 --> 17:41.145
No.

17:43.647 --> 17:45.733
Thanks, Veronica.
Thanks, everyone.

17:46.400 --> 17:48.819
- Oh, it's Kevin!
- Happy birthday, bud.

17:49.028 --> 17:50.779
This is my boyfriend,
Joaquin.

17:50.988 --> 17:52.781
Hey, nice to meet you.

17:52.990 --> 17:55.409
Um, has anyone seen Betty?

18:20.392 --> 18:21.935
That was haunting, Betty.

18:23.729 --> 18:25.647
Blow out the candles
and make a wish.

18:27.900 --> 18:29.902
I wish it were just
the two of us right now.

18:35.949 --> 18:37.076
One blow!

18:40.621 --> 18:41.288
Veronica?

18:43.165 --> 18:44.708
The stuff with your dad?

18:44.917 --> 18:46.460
It's just the tip
of the iceberg.

18:46.668 --> 18:47.586
I don't want to talk about it.

18:47.795 --> 18:48.504
Okay.

18:50.214 --> 18:51.006
You want a drink?

18:51.215 --> 18:52.800
Isn't it the New York
sophisticate

18:53.008 --> 18:54.885
who's supposed to corrupt
the sweet small-town boy?

18:59.807 --> 19:01.141
My dad's visiting my mom.

19:02.684 --> 19:04.353
They're about to finalize
the divorce.

19:04.561 --> 19:07.106
God, Archie, if my mom had
anything to do with that...

19:07.314 --> 19:08.857
No. This was them.

19:09.650 --> 19:10.651
My mom wanted
to leave Riverdale,

19:10.859 --> 19:12.152
my dad wanted to stay.

19:13.070 --> 19:15.114
I had to choose,
and I chose my dad.

19:16.073 --> 19:18.826
Forget it. It's nothing
compared to what
you're going through.

19:21.495 --> 19:23.038
He threatened me, Archie.

19:24.081 --> 19:27.584
Said he would destroy my mom
if I didn't make a statement
on his behalf.

19:27.793 --> 19:29.962
Said she was just as guilty
as he was.

19:31.255 --> 19:33.215
And maybe he's lying
or maybe he isn't.

19:33.423 --> 19:35.884
And maybe he killed
Jason Blossom, and...

19:40.556 --> 19:41.431
Oh, sorry.

19:43.267 --> 19:45.060
Just coming to get
ice cream, so...

19:45.269 --> 19:46.311
Is everything okay?

19:46.520 --> 19:49.398
Yeah, no, I'm just not in a
party mood like I usually am.

19:49.606 --> 19:51.608
- That makes two of us.
- Whoa. Wait.

19:52.776 --> 19:55.279
You're not actually upset that
I threw you a party, are you?

19:55.487 --> 19:57.781
It is nice, Betty.
I appreciate it.

19:57.990 --> 19:59.408
It's just I would be happier

19:59.616 --> 20:01.243
if it was just the four of us
in a booth at Pop's.

20:01.451 --> 20:02.494
Yeah. But we always do that.

20:02.703 --> 20:04.163
I wanted to do
something special.

20:04.371 --> 20:05.956
"The road to hell is paved
with good intentions."

20:06.165 --> 20:08.625
Why is everything
so doom and gloom
with you, Jug?

20:08.834 --> 20:10.210
Why can't it just
be normal for once?

20:10.419 --> 20:13.422
I'm not normal,
I'm not wired to be normal.

20:16.717 --> 20:17.926
How many more people
did you invite to this thing?

20:18.135 --> 20:20.012
No one. Inner-circle only.

20:25.809 --> 20:27.269
Did you really think
you could have a party

20:27.477 --> 20:28.645
without inviting <i>moi?</i>

20:29.646 --> 20:30.772
Or me?

20:31.481 --> 20:32.399
Archie,
where do you want the kegs?

20:35.819 --> 20:37.779
Screw it! One in the kitchen,
one in the backyard.

21:04.598 --> 21:06.266
Why are they doing this?

21:06.475 --> 21:08.352
They're agents of chaos,
Kevin.

21:08.560 --> 21:09.686
They don't need a reason.

21:10.938 --> 21:14.233
But if I had to guess?
Payback.

21:17.444 --> 21:19.738
Dude, Valerie just got here.
You think she wants me back?

21:19.947 --> 21:20.948
Archie, as my blood-brother,

21:21.156 --> 21:22.866
it was your sole
responsibility

21:23.075 --> 21:25.661
to ensure that something
like this never happened
on my birthday.

21:25.869 --> 21:26.995
And now we're here.

21:27.204 --> 21:28.789
In the middle
of a Seth Rogen movie.

21:28.997 --> 21:30.916
This was Betty's idea, okay?
I just went along with it.

21:31.124 --> 21:32.876
- It's so not me.
- It doesn't matter, Jughead,

21:33.085 --> 21:34.127
you're her boyfriend now.

21:34.336 --> 21:35.629
- What does that mean?
- It means

21:35.837 --> 21:37.839
you're getting
your birthday party whether
you want one or not.

21:41.718 --> 21:43.595
Dad, hey.

21:44.179 --> 21:45.264
Happy birthday, Jughead.

21:47.182 --> 21:48.767
How are you, Mr. Jones?

21:49.393 --> 21:51.812
Happy to be here,
celebrating with my son.

21:54.815 --> 21:56.316
Didn't realize you had
so many friends.

21:56.525 --> 21:57.276
I don't.

21:58.527 --> 22:00.404
And fair warning.
You're the only adult here.

22:00.612 --> 22:01.613
So I gather.

22:02.572 --> 22:04.241
- Where can I put this?
- There's a table in the den.

22:06.159 --> 22:07.160
Dad.

22:09.329 --> 22:12.624
- Did Betty call you?
- Yeah, she came by too.

22:12.833 --> 22:14.459
She knows what she wants,
that one.

22:15.836 --> 22:16.503
I'll be back.

22:25.429 --> 22:26.930
Do you ever go down
to Sweetwater River?

22:27.139 --> 22:30.017
- To what, fool around?
- Yeah.

22:30.225 --> 22:32.477
- Do you?
- I've been once or twice.

22:35.939 --> 22:37.316
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

22:40.110 --> 22:42.821
You can cut the sexual tension
in here with a knife.

22:44.031 --> 22:45.407
What's up, Joaquin?

22:45.615 --> 22:46.700
Nothing.

22:46.908 --> 22:49.077
Kevin, you know FP,
Jughead's dad?

22:49.286 --> 22:50.412
Yeah, we've met.

22:50.620 --> 22:52.039
You kicked me out
of the Whyte Wyrm.

22:52.247 --> 22:54.207
Good times. Joaquin...

22:54.416 --> 22:56.001
You wanna show me
where the can is?

22:56.209 --> 22:57.461
- Yeah, it's right...
- Yeah, um...

22:57.669 --> 22:58.837
I'll show you.

23:19.566 --> 23:20.692
What is that
middle-aged Serpent

23:20.901 --> 23:22.235
doing at a high school kegger?

23:22.444 --> 23:23.487
Are you serious?
You don't know?

23:23.695 --> 23:25.030
Veronica,
that's Jughead's dad.

23:26.073 --> 23:27.324
- Really.
- Yeah.

23:28.367 --> 23:29.785
And the plot thickens.

23:41.129 --> 23:42.089
Betty.

23:43.090 --> 23:44.883
- You here to roofie me again?
- No, Chuck,

23:46.426 --> 23:47.969
I'm going to ask you to leave.

23:48.178 --> 23:50.138
- Nicely.
- Nicely?

23:50.347 --> 23:52.766
Because, what, you're back
to being the nice girl now?

23:52.974 --> 23:54.768
Betty, what you
and Veronica did

23:54.976 --> 23:56.728
when you guys got me kicked
off the football team,

23:56.937 --> 24:00.565
you ruined any chance I had
of playing for Notre Dame.

24:00.774 --> 24:02.275
Hell, for any good school.

24:02.484 --> 24:07.155
I'm sorry that after you
sexually harassed those girls,

24:07.364 --> 24:10.158
that there were
actual consequences, Chuck.

24:12.035 --> 24:13.453
That night,
I saw the real you.

24:18.166 --> 24:19.209
The dark you.

24:20.669 --> 24:21.962
The Betty
that I actually think about

24:22.170 --> 24:23.547
every night
when I'm laying in bed.

24:30.804 --> 24:33.473
You're the last person
I expected to see
at my son's birthday party.

24:33.682 --> 24:35.308
Just doing my job,
keeping my ear to the ground.

24:35.517 --> 24:37.727
And your tongue
in the Sheriff's kid's mouth.

24:38.812 --> 24:41.022
- Did you hear
anything interesting?
- Actually, yeah.

24:41.231 --> 24:42.691
Hiram Lodge's
daughter is here.

24:42.941 --> 24:45.569
She said something
about her father being
connected to Jason's murder.

24:47.154 --> 24:48.280
That is not good.

24:49.072 --> 24:50.490
Hiram and I had some business.

24:50.699 --> 24:51.950
What does your boyfriend
say about that?

24:52.159 --> 24:53.785
- His father, you mean?
- Yeah.

24:53.994 --> 24:55.829
- I'll find out.
- Yeah. You better.

24:56.037 --> 24:58.707
These kids are more
on the ball than the Sheriff.
Let's go.

25:01.918 --> 25:04.337
<i>You do know my dad
has a drinking problem, right?</i>

25:04.546 --> 25:05.505
Of course I do.

25:05.714 --> 25:07.299
I didn't think people
would be drinking tonight.

25:07.507 --> 25:09.968
I didn't plan
on Chuck and Cheryl,

25:10.177 --> 25:12.012
and the rest of the school
crashing, okay?

25:12.220 --> 25:13.763
This was supposed
to be just your friends.

25:13.972 --> 25:16.808
You and Archie
are my friends, okay?

25:17.767 --> 25:18.935
Everyone else,

25:19.561 --> 25:22.022
including Kevin,
including Veronica,

25:22.230 --> 25:23.607
are people that,
two months ago,

25:23.815 --> 25:25.859
- I would've actively shunned.
- Why?

25:26.067 --> 25:28.570
In case you haven't noticed,
I'm weird.

25:29.112 --> 25:30.447
I'm a weirdo.

25:30.655 --> 25:34.242
I don't fit in,
and I don't want to fit in.

25:34.868 --> 25:36.703
Have you ever seen me
without this stupid hat on?

25:36.912 --> 25:39.206
- That's weird.
- Why are you getting so upset?

25:39.873 --> 25:43.502
- It's just a party, Jug.
- It's not just a party.

25:43.710 --> 25:46.588
It's the fact that you
don't know or even care

25:46.796 --> 25:50.050
that this is the last thing
I would want.

25:50.258 --> 25:52.010
You did this for you.
To prove something.

25:52.219 --> 25:54.429
- To prove what?
- You're a great girlfriend.

25:54.638 --> 25:55.889
I don't know.

25:56.097 --> 25:58.225
Doesn't it ever
occur to you just how
different we are?

25:58.433 --> 26:01.686
Like on a cellular DNA
kind of level?

26:01.895 --> 26:03.063
You're a straight-A student,

26:03.230 --> 26:06.149
you're a cheerleader,
for God's sakes.

26:06.358 --> 26:08.401
You're the perfect
girl next door.

26:08.610 --> 26:09.486
I hate that word.

26:09.694 --> 26:12.322
I'm the damaged loner outsider

26:12.531 --> 26:14.366
from the wrong side
of the tracks.

26:14.908 --> 26:17.285
Betty, come on.

26:17.494 --> 26:18.620
Who are we kidding?

26:20.413 --> 26:21.915
We're on borrowed time.

26:22.123 --> 26:23.333
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

26:23.542 --> 26:27.295
Betty, I'm not one
of your projects, okay?

26:27.504 --> 26:28.922
Like solving Jason's murder...

26:29.130 --> 26:31.174
No. You're not a project,
you're my boyfriend.

26:31.383 --> 26:33.760
Until you're sick
of slumming it with me,

26:33.969 --> 26:35.720
or until Archie
changes his mind

26:35.929 --> 26:37.347
and says he wants
to be with you?

26:50.944 --> 26:52.404
Valerie, hey...

26:52.612 --> 26:54.489
- I'm looking for Melody.
- No, no, no, can we talk?

26:54.698 --> 26:56.825
I just wanted to say
what if... What if we made
a mistake?

26:57.033 --> 26:59.578
First of all,
we didn't do anything.

26:59.786 --> 27:01.830
I broke up with you
because I thought
you were a hot mess.

27:02.789 --> 27:03.748
Clearly, I was right.

27:04.958 --> 27:06.501
Wait, Valerie...

27:06.710 --> 27:08.253
What is your problem, Archie?

27:08.461 --> 27:10.255
You shut me out, remember?

27:10.463 --> 27:11.381
It's too late.

27:41.244 --> 27:43.538
<i>Archie,
everything all right?</i>

27:48.793 --> 27:50.545
- Jughead. Hey.
- Hey, Ethel.

27:50.754 --> 27:53.923
You didn't have
a piece of cake.
It's bad luck.

27:54.132 --> 27:55.967
This whole night
is bad luck.

27:57.969 --> 27:59.512
I'm ghosting.
I'll see you at school.

28:05.018 --> 28:06.019
Hey. Whoa.

28:06.227 --> 28:07.312
Where you going,
guest of honor?

28:08.980 --> 28:10.148
Get out of my way, Chuck.

28:10.357 --> 28:11.650
Oh, but you can't leave now.

28:13.360 --> 28:14.653
We haven't even
played our game yet.

28:15.862 --> 28:17.113
Listen up, party people.

28:18.531 --> 28:20.408
Everyone has their secrets.

28:20.617 --> 28:22.118
And we've all done
our fair share of sinning.

28:22.327 --> 28:24.496
That's one thing my dear
brother's death has revealed.

28:25.413 --> 28:27.832
So let's play a little game
to get those secrets
out in the open.

28:37.133 --> 28:39.135
What the hell
is Secrets and Sins?

28:39.344 --> 28:41.012
It's a variation
on Truth or Dare.

28:41.221 --> 28:43.723
In which we own our truths.

28:43.932 --> 28:45.141
By telling it like it is.

28:45.350 --> 28:47.852
I'll start the game
with Veronica Lodge.

28:48.061 --> 28:49.229
- Naturally.
- Let's begin

28:49.437 --> 28:51.648
with the day you and your
mob wife of a mother

28:51.856 --> 28:54.025
came to town
for a so-called "fresh start."

28:54.234 --> 28:55.735
Tell us, Veronica,
what's so fresh

28:55.944 --> 28:57.904
about defiling Archie Andrews
in a closet?

28:58.113 --> 28:59.739
- That was your doing.
- Moving on

28:59.948 --> 29:01.241
to dear Daddy Lodge...

29:01.449 --> 29:04.285
Isn't it true
that your father, from prison,

29:04.494 --> 29:06.579
illegally purchased
the drive-in land?

29:06.746 --> 29:07.997
Which makes me wonder.

29:08.206 --> 29:09.666
What else is he doing
from behind bars?

29:09.874 --> 29:11.543
Well,
I can't speak for my father,

29:11.751 --> 29:14.879
but I can think of someone
with a very dirty secret.

29:15.088 --> 29:18.007
Specifically, Cheryl killing
her very own brother.

29:18.216 --> 29:19.884
Everyone knows how much
I loved my brother.

29:20.093 --> 29:20.969
Exactly.

29:22.011 --> 29:23.388
But did you love him maybe

29:23.596 --> 29:25.682
in ways that a sister
shouldn't love a brother?

29:25.890 --> 29:29.978
And as you got older,
Jason started to think
it was strange, unnatural.

29:30.186 --> 29:32.272
So he chose Polly over you.

29:32.480 --> 29:33.940
So you shot him
between the eyes

29:34.149 --> 29:36.276
with one of your father's
many hunting rifles.

29:36.484 --> 29:39.195
This is riveting,
I can't breathe.

29:39.779 --> 29:40.905
This game is sick.

29:41.656 --> 29:44.033
- I wanna go next.
- That's the spirit, Doiley.

29:44.242 --> 29:46.035
What secrets do you have
to reveal to us?

29:46.244 --> 29:48.288
I saw Ms. Grundy's car

29:48.455 --> 29:51.207
by Sweetwater River,
the day Jason went missing.

29:51.416 --> 29:53.168
I told Betty and Jughead,

29:53.376 --> 29:54.919
and then,
Ms. Grundy quit her job

29:55.128 --> 29:57.380
and left Riverdale,
like, two days later.

29:57.589 --> 30:01.301
And let's not forget
that Archie was also at the
Sweetwater that morning.

30:01.509 --> 30:03.803
Oh, my God, color me shocked,
Archie Andrews.

30:04.012 --> 30:06.765
Is that why you became
a mediocre musician overnight?

30:06.973 --> 30:09.476
Because you and Ms. Foureyes
were pulling a Mary Kay
Letourneau?

30:09.684 --> 30:10.810
Don't say anything, Archie.

30:11.019 --> 30:12.270
Don't get in the gutter
with them.

30:12.479 --> 30:14.773
Wait, what?
Andrews was banging a teacher?

30:14.981 --> 30:16.399
Well, damn,
I wish I would have known.

30:16.608 --> 30:18.735
I would've added you
and Ms. Grundy to the
board of conquests.

30:18.943 --> 30:20.653
Classy, Chuck, as always.

30:20.862 --> 30:22.822
Wait a second,
that also explains

30:23.031 --> 30:25.325
why Archie can't seem to keep
a girlfriend to save his life.

30:25.533 --> 30:27.702
He's got serious
Mommy issues.

30:27.911 --> 30:29.662
Anything to say for yourself,
Arch?

30:29.871 --> 30:31.498
Were you victim
or perpetrator?

30:31.706 --> 30:33.166
Dilton Doiley plays with guns.

30:33.374 --> 30:34.125
Big whoop, Betty.

30:34.334 --> 30:37.170
So Doiley's a psychopath,
everyone knows that.

30:37.378 --> 30:39.130
Well, I guess
it's my turn now.

30:39.339 --> 30:43.343
Boy, do I have
a twisted secret to reveal.

30:43.510 --> 30:45.136
Starring Betty Cooper.

30:45.345 --> 30:46.346
Leave her
the hell alone, Chuck.

30:46.554 --> 30:47.722
Shut up, Andrews.

30:47.931 --> 30:49.933
Look, you may get a free
peepshow every night,

30:50.141 --> 30:51.309
but you do not know her.

30:51.976 --> 30:54.020
Hell, Betty doesn't
even know herself.

30:54.229 --> 30:56.022
Everybody knows
why I got suspended.

30:56.231 --> 30:58.191
But what you don't know...

30:58.399 --> 31:03.363
She dressed up like a hooker,
in a God-awful black wig,

31:03.530 --> 31:06.241
drugged me,
handcuffed me in the Jacuzzi,

31:06.449 --> 31:08.034
and I almost drowned

31:08.243 --> 31:10.870
until she got me to say
what she wanted to hear.

31:11.079 --> 31:13.206
And then she really lost it.

31:13.414 --> 31:15.416
She actually thought
she was Polly.

31:15.625 --> 31:18.044
But, hey, you knew
all about this, right,
Jughead?

31:22.674 --> 31:23.967
Enough! That's enough!

31:24.175 --> 31:25.552
Get your hands
off me, snake.

31:26.553 --> 31:27.554
Get out!

31:30.974 --> 31:32.016
Go on!

31:41.359 --> 31:43.570
What are you looking at?
The party's done.

31:45.363 --> 31:46.865
It's over! Go home!

31:51.578 --> 31:53.162
Whoa, where the hell
are you going?

31:53.371 --> 31:56.708
What, you want to give me
some advice on my right hook?

31:56.916 --> 31:58.626
I want you to go back inside
and talk to your girl.

31:58.835 --> 32:00.044
I don't think
it's gonna work out.

32:01.462 --> 32:03.256
Irreconcilable differences.

32:03.464 --> 32:06.467
Don't run away from it.
Don't run away.

32:06.676 --> 32:08.303
You've got something
good here.

32:08.511 --> 32:09.929
With her, with your friends.

32:10.138 --> 32:11.347
Something that...

32:11.556 --> 32:12.891
Something that we could
never give you.

32:14.475 --> 32:16.019
Also, man up.

32:16.227 --> 32:18.354
After what I just saw
in there, she needs you.

32:30.700 --> 32:32.619
FP.

32:32.827 --> 32:34.495
As block captain
of the Neighborhood Watch,

32:34.704 --> 32:35.914
I am obligated to ask you

32:36.122 --> 32:37.582
what you're doing
on this side of town.

32:37.790 --> 32:39.918
Don't act so high
and mighty, Alice.

32:40.126 --> 32:42.545
You may not live
on the Southside anymore,

32:42.754 --> 32:45.089
you may not dress like
you're from the Southside,

32:45.298 --> 32:47.133
but we both know the truth.

32:47.842 --> 32:49.594
Snakes don't shed
their skin so easily.

32:50.762 --> 32:51.930
Good night, FP.

32:52.138 --> 32:53.556
Now get the hell
out of my neighborhood.

32:53.765 --> 32:55.058
You're still hot, Alice.

32:55.266 --> 32:56.726
Too bad you're a stick
in the mud.

33:03.650 --> 33:06.361
And all this time,
I thought you were a lover,
not a fighter.

33:07.737 --> 33:08.738
I'm both.

33:09.572 --> 33:10.740
I've got layers.

33:12.951 --> 33:14.744
You were doing something nice,

33:15.328 --> 33:16.871
it's just that sometimes,

33:18.122 --> 33:20.875
when people do
nice things for me,
I short circuit.

33:21.084 --> 33:22.418
Maybe I'm not used to it.

33:22.627 --> 33:23.795
Maybe I'm scared.

33:26.005 --> 33:27.298
Of getting hurt.

33:28.132 --> 33:31.886
Or being rejected
for being myself.

33:34.514 --> 33:36.391
I should have told you
about Chuck.

33:38.017 --> 33:39.018
But I lied.

33:40.311 --> 33:44.524
And instead I threw you
this party that you
didn't even want.

33:46.025 --> 33:47.110
Why did you?

33:48.987 --> 33:53.700
Something is very,
very wrong with me.

33:54.450 --> 33:56.869
Like there's
this darkness in me

33:57.036 --> 33:59.330
that's overwhelming
sometimes,

33:59.539 --> 34:01.708
and I don't know
where it comes from.

34:01.916 --> 34:05.336
But I think that's what makes
me do these crazy things.
Like...

34:41.039 --> 34:43.541
How am I ever
gonna look anyone
in the eye ever again?

34:43.750 --> 34:45.960
By Monday,
this will all be but a dream.

34:46.961 --> 34:49.505
Trust me.
No one will remember anything.

34:49.714 --> 34:52.175
Except maybe that I accused
Cheryl of twincest.

34:56.262 --> 34:57.889
I drunk-dialed my dad, Ronnie.

34:58.097 --> 34:59.057
Archie.

35:00.767 --> 35:01.976
What did you say?

35:02.852 --> 35:04.896
I told him not to sign
the divorce papers.

35:06.189 --> 35:07.190
I don't even know why,

35:07.398 --> 35:09.067
it's not like I even want them
to get back together.

35:11.444 --> 35:13.279
Veronica,
why do I keep doing this?

35:13.488 --> 35:14.864
I keep wrecking things.

35:15.073 --> 35:16.240
Welcome to my life.

35:17.825 --> 35:21.162
Every day, I feel
like there's a new secret,

35:21.370 --> 35:23.247
a new lie
about my parents

35:23.456 --> 35:24.415
and what they've done.

35:27.293 --> 35:29.587
I don't want
my mom to be guilty, Archie.

35:30.713 --> 35:32.673
I really want that
to be a lie.

35:35.301 --> 35:36.427
Do you ever wonder...

35:38.513 --> 35:39.972
What if you had
done things differently,

35:40.181 --> 35:42.308
what if you had made
different choices?

35:42.517 --> 35:43.893
What do you mean,
different choices?

35:44.102 --> 35:45.436
Every day I wonder,

35:45.645 --> 35:47.772
what if I had left Riverdale
with my mom?

35:47.980 --> 35:48.940
Would things be...

35:50.650 --> 35:51.984
Would I be better off?

35:52.151 --> 35:54.237
I can't answer that, Archie,

35:54.445 --> 35:55.947
but we wouldn't have met,

35:56.155 --> 36:00.118
and that would've been
a tragedy of epic proportions.

36:02.328 --> 36:03.830
I'm messed up, Veronica...

36:04.038 --> 36:05.456
We all are, Archie.

36:06.749 --> 36:09.210
And, honestly,
you less than most.

37:34.712 --> 37:37.006
Veronica. Hey, good morning.

37:40.885 --> 37:42.553
Morning, Jughead.

37:46.224 --> 37:47.642
Um...

37:47.850 --> 37:48.726
So listen...

37:48.935 --> 37:52.063
Don't... Don't worry,
my lips are sealed.

37:52.647 --> 37:54.857
Okay. Cool.

37:57.735 --> 38:01.697
Smithers, you've known
my parents a very long time,
haven't you?

38:01.906 --> 38:04.242
Oh, my, yes, ages.

38:04.450 --> 38:09.163
And would you describe
my father as a good man?

38:10.456 --> 38:11.666
I'd rather not say, miss.

38:14.252 --> 38:16.379
And my mother, is she...

38:16.587 --> 38:18.130
Unequivocally good.

38:19.715 --> 38:21.133
No doubt in my mind
about that.

38:21.884 --> 38:23.010
Thank you, Smithers.

38:27.807 --> 38:30.518
- Veronica.
- I'm sorry I'm late.

38:32.979 --> 38:36.774
And thank you, Mom,
for not getting mad
that I slept over at Betty's.

38:37.775 --> 38:39.402
Thank you for coming.

38:39.610 --> 38:41.320
I believe in you, Mom.

38:46.367 --> 38:48.869
And I'm ready to go on record

38:49.078 --> 38:50.871
about how much
my mom and dad love me.

38:57.628 --> 38:59.672
Long night's journey into day?

39:05.011 --> 39:06.679
I can't face the music
right now.

39:06.887 --> 39:08.389
Yeah, I understand.

39:10.099 --> 39:11.600
So, you and Veronica...

39:13.769 --> 39:14.729
Yeah...

39:15.604 --> 39:17.273
- Jug...
- Don't worry.

39:17.481 --> 39:20.067
I'm never telling anyone
anything literally ever.

39:20.276 --> 39:21.277
Okay, good.

39:22.778 --> 39:24.280
Thanks. That's great.

39:30.953 --> 39:32.163
I brewed some High Point

39:32.371 --> 39:35.249
and brought you some aspirin
for the headache
I'm sure you have.

39:35.458 --> 39:36.500
Thanks, Mom.

39:39.378 --> 39:41.797
So I saw that you
invited Jughead's dad

39:42.006 --> 39:44.175
to your little
soiree last night.

39:44.383 --> 39:47.303
I did.
I thought it would be nice.

39:47.511 --> 39:51.140
And he was talking
to a long-haired delinquent
wearing a leather jacket.

39:51.349 --> 39:52.933
- You mean Joaquin?
- Is that his name?

39:53.142 --> 39:55.394
They know each other
through the Serpents.

39:55.603 --> 39:56.812
He's kind of dating Kevin.

39:57.021 --> 39:57.813
What?

39:58.564 --> 40:01.609
A Southside Serpent
dating the Sheriff's son?

40:02.943 --> 40:05.654
This is a small town,
but it's not that small.

40:11.327 --> 40:12.411
Hi there.

40:12.953 --> 40:17.166
Decaf skim latte
and a fresh scone.

40:17.875 --> 40:19.668
The last time
you brought me baked goods

40:19.877 --> 40:21.420
was because you kissed Archie.

40:26.884 --> 40:27.885
Betty...

40:28.761 --> 40:31.722
I just testified
on my father's behalf

40:31.931 --> 40:34.892
and helped his chances
of going free.

40:35.101 --> 40:37.144
That's good news, right?

40:38.354 --> 40:43.442
My dad hired Jughead's dad
to trash the drive-in.

40:43.651 --> 40:46.612
And given recent events,
it's not inconceivable

40:46.821 --> 40:50.408
that he might've hired him
to do other jobs.

40:51.409 --> 40:55.496
Like go after Jason
as payback for what
the Blossoms did to him.

40:59.708 --> 41:02.253
I want to help
with your investigation.

41:03.546 --> 41:04.630
I want the truth.

41:05.881 --> 41:06.882
Whatever it is.

41:08.926 --> 41:11.178
<i>Whether you believe
in order or chaos,</i>

41:11.387 --> 41:13.264
<i>in the end, it's the same...</i>

41:13.472 --> 41:15.266
<i>We are either
in control of our lives,</i>

41:15.474 --> 41:17.268
<i>or merely think we are.</i>

41:17.476 --> 41:18.394
Miss Veronica.

41:20.688 --> 41:21.856
Package arrived for you.

41:38.747 --> 41:41.000
Archie.

41:43.461 --> 41:44.170
We're home.

41:47.006 --> 41:47.965
Mom?

41:49.175 --> 41:50.050
Hi, honey.
