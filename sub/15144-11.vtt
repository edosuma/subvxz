Hey, guys.

00:10.125 --> 00:11.875
Check it out!

00:11.917 --> 00:14.417
Science Bob just sent us tickets

00:11.917 --> 00:14.417
for his live show, Friday night.

00:14.458 --> 00:15.917
I can't wait!

00:15.959 --> 00:19.625
Actually, you can wait.

00:15.959 --> 00:19.625
You just don't want to.

00:19.667 --> 00:23.792
It's a figure of speech, Ricky.

00:23.834 --> 00:26.041
- Ah, front row seats.

00:26.083 --> 00:28.875
We're Science B's VIPs.

00:28.917 --> 00:31.709
I hope he does that experiment

00:28.917 --> 00:31.709
where he turns olive juice

00:31.750 --> 00:35.166
into an olive,

00:31.750 --> 00:35.166
using muscular astronomy.

00:35.208 --> 00:39.834
Actually, it's molecular

00:35.208 --> 00:39.834
gastronomy.

00:39.875 --> 00:42.792
Which is the cooking

00:39.875 --> 00:42.792
or eating of fine food.

Whatever--as long as I get

00:44.959 --> 00:48.667
to eat that delicious olive.

00:48.709 --> 00:50.875
Technically

00:48.709 --> 00:50.875
if it's made of juice,

00:50.917 --> 00:51.875
you're drinking it.

[all sighing]

00:54.417 --> 00:57.667
Ricky, you don't have

00:54.417 --> 00:57.667
to be right all the time.

00:57.709 --> 01:00.250
Yeah, you're always

00:57.709 --> 01:00.250
correcting us.

01:00.291 --> 01:01.500
I don't always.

01:01.542 --> 01:03.041

Friday the 13th

01:22.417 --> 01:23.667
is just a day

01:23.709 --> 01:25.625

You really don't believe

01:25.667 --> 01:28.667
in silly superstitions, do you?

01:28.709 --> 01:31.917
No, not silly ones.

01:28.709 --> 01:31.917
Just real ones.

01:31.959 --> 01:34.875
Like Friday the 13th--

01:31.959 --> 01:34.875
It's bad luck.

01:34.917 --> 01:38.875
In reality, there's no such

01:34.917 --> 01:38.875
thing as bad luck.

01:38.917 --> 01:42.291
Friday the 13th is just

01:38.917 --> 01:42.291
a day like any other day.

01:42.333 --> 01:44.500
- Don't correct my friend.

- But you just said--

01:44.542 --> 01:46.542
Pipe down, friend.

You may know the answers

01:46.583 --> 01:48.875

but you can't know for sure

01:48.917 --> 01:53.208
superstitions aren't real.

02:59.166 --> 03:02.041
Yeah, and he does

02:59.166 --> 03:02.041
it to me all the time.

Like he's more

What if we prove

03:08.500 --> 03:11.667
superstitions are real?

03:11.709 --> 03:13.500
So you do think

03:11.709 --> 03:13.500
they're real?

[snorts] Of course not,

about superstitions

03:19.875 --> 03:22.625

07:56.667 --> 07:59.667
Phase two--Ricky drinks

07:56.667 --> 07:59.667
the spoiled milk

07:59.709 --> 08:00.875
to cool his mouth.

08:00.917 --> 08:03.500
Why would he drink

08:00.917 --> 08:03.500
spoiled milk?

08:03.542 --> 08:04.917
'Cause he doesn't know

08:03.542 --> 08:04.917
it's spoiled.

08:04.959 --> 08:06.166
Well then,

08:04.959 --> 08:06.166
who's gonna tell him?

08:06.208 --> 08:07.166
Nobody!

08:07.208 --> 08:08.458
We don't want him to know.

08:08.500 --> 08:10.500
The whole plan revolves

08:08.500 --> 08:10.500
around the element

08:10.542 --> 08:11.959
of not knowing.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.792
Oh, then I'm good.

08:16.041 --> 08:17.959
Now let's go get Ricky.

08:20.917 --> 08:23.083
Ah, looks like Nicky's

08:20.917 --> 08:23.083
been baking.

08:23.125 --> 08:25.583
And left a mess which,

08:23.125 --> 08:25.583
not to worry,

08:25.625 --> 08:27.625
I will clean up.

08:27.667 --> 08:30.792
Oh.

08:27.667 --> 08:30.792
[chuckles]

08:30.834 --> 08:32.583
But honey, I--

08:30.834 --> 08:32.583
I thought you said

08:32.625 --> 08:33.750
you were gonna clean up.

08:33.792 --> 08:36.041
I will.

08:33.792 --> 08:36.041
In Tom time.

08:37.208 --> 08:39.417
But ah--there's milk out.

08:39.458 --> 08:40.792
Noted.

08:42.792 --> 08:45.041
[stammers]

08:42.792 --> 08:45.041
But it's gonna spoil.

08:45.083 --> 08:46.917
You know what, I'm so sorry.

08:45.083 --> 08:46.917
Sorry.

08:46.959 --> 08:49.750
I will let you do it.

08:49.792 --> 08:52.208
But I can't live in Tom time!

08:54.959 --> 08:57.959
Honey,

08:54.959 --> 08:57.959
I said I'd do it!

08:58.000 --> 08:59.500
[sighs]

08:59.542 --> 09:01.667
Everything's gotta be done

08:59.542 --> 09:01.667
the Anne way.

09:03.417 --> 09:05.291
Oh, boy.

09:05.333 --> 09:07.417
Here, let me just--

09:07.458 --> 09:09.166
There we go.

09:09.208 --> 09:13.709
Good thing the floor

09:09.208 --> 09:13.709
is Tom clean.

09:13.750 --> 09:15.875
Well, it's not my hair.

09:18.792 --> 09:22.166
Ooh! Cream puffs!

09:22.208 --> 09:24.250
My favorite!

09:26.083 --> 09:27.500
Mmm...

09:27.542 --> 09:29.125
Mmm...

09:29.166 --> 09:30.625
Mmm...

09:30.667 --> 09:32.417
Uh-oh.

09:32.458 --> 09:35.208
Aaaah!

09:35.250 --> 09:36.667
Fridge!

09:45.667 --> 09:47.917
What the heck?

09:47.959 --> 09:50.917
Yuck. Looks like

09:47.959 --> 09:50.917
that milk is spoiled.

09:56.083 --> 09:58.375
But this one's

09:56.083 --> 09:58.375
fresh as a daisy.

09:58.417 --> 10:01.792
Looks like

09:58.417 --> 10:01.792
it's my lucky day.

10:03.583 --> 10:06.583
You said the good milk

10:03.583 --> 10:06.583
was in the fridge!

10:06.625 --> 10:07.959
It<i> was!</i>

10:08.000 --> 10:09.417
Well, how do you

10:08.000 --> 10:09.417
explain this?

10:09.458 --> 10:11.291
- I can't!

10:09.458 --> 10:11.291
- And the cream puff switch?

10:11.333 --> 10:12.750
- I can't!

10:11.333 --> 10:12.750
- And phase two happening

10:12.792 --> 10:14.041
before phase one?

10:14.083 --> 10:15.750
Okay, I already

10:14.083 --> 10:15.750
explained that.

10:15.792 --> 10:18.333
The rest I can't explain.

10:18.375 --> 10:20.750
Well, I can.

10:18.375 --> 10:20.750
It's bad luck from the ladder!

10:20.792 --> 10:22.834
No, it's not.

10:22.875 --> 10:26.083
Look, we just need

10:22.875 --> 10:26.083
to stick to the plan and

10:22.875 --> 10:26.083
convince Ricky superstitions are

10:22.875 --> 10:26.083
real.

10:26.125 --> 10:28.125
Look, I don't wanna

10:26.125 --> 10:28.125
tempt fate anymore.

10:28.166 --> 10:30.500
- I'm out.

10:28.166 --> 10:30.500
- No! Don't quit now!

10:30.542 --> 10:33.375
Look, we're so close to proving

10:30.542 --> 10:33.375
Ricky wrong about something.

10:33.417 --> 10:35.834
All we have to do

10:33.417 --> 10:35.834
is just come up with a plan

10:35.875 --> 10:38.417
that leaves nothing

10:35.875 --> 10:38.417
to chance.

10:38.458 --> 10:40.792
Our Cousin Chance

10:38.458 --> 10:40.792
from Idaho?

10:40.834 --> 10:43.208
Why would we

10:40.834 --> 10:43.208
leave it to him?

10:43.250 --> 10:46.041
He's a baby!

10:50.250 --> 10:52.000
I saw him go in.

10:52.041 --> 10:54.834
Operation Broken Bathroom

10:52.041 --> 10:54.834
is a go.

10:58.583 --> 11:00.709
Oh, no!

11:05.667 --> 11:07.750
Eew! Gross!

11:09.667 --> 11:11.709
Shoot!

11:16.000 --> 11:18.125
Aaah!

11:20.000 --> 11:23.125
Aaah!

11:23.166 --> 11:25.959
Ohh-- aah!

11:28.208 --> 11:29.875
[breathing hard]

11:29.917 --> 11:31.625
What the--

11:34.083 --> 11:36.709
There's no such thing

11:34.083 --> 11:36.709
as bad luck.

11:36.750 --> 11:38.750
There's no such

11:36.750 --> 11:38.750
thing as bad luck.

11:42.041 --> 11:44.375
There is such a thing

11:42.041 --> 11:44.375
as bad luck.

11:46.208 --> 11:47.917
Help!

11:47.959 --> 11:50.125
Let me outta here!

11:50.166 --> 11:53.417
If the door handle's

11:50.166 --> 11:53.417
broken, how's he gonna get out?

11:53.458 --> 11:56.208
I took the hinge pins

11:53.458 --> 11:56.208
out of the door, so one good

11:53.458 --> 11:56.208
push will make it--

11:56.250 --> 11:58.291
[loud thud,

11:56.250 --> 11:58.291
thumping]

12:02.875 --> 12:05.208
Bad luck is real!

12:07.125 --> 12:10.291
I thought you don't believe

12:07.125 --> 12:10.291
in that sort of thing.

12:10.333 --> 12:12.792
I didn't... but I walked

12:10.333 --> 12:12.792
under that ladder,

12:12.834 --> 12:17.166
and now... all these things...

12:12.834 --> 12:17.166
one after another...

12:17.208 --> 12:18.917
it can't be a coincidence.

12:18.959 --> 12:23.583
So you admit you were actually

12:18.959 --> 12:23.583
wrong about something?

12:23.625 --> 12:26.667
I... I guess I was.

12:26.709 --> 12:29.000
Oh, my gosh.

12:29.041 --> 12:31.250
Superstitions are real.

12:36.208 --> 12:38.083
Superstitions are real.

12:38.125 --> 12:39.834
I heard you!

12:39.875 --> 12:42.583
Superstitions are real!

12:42.625 --> 12:44.500
Uh-oh.

12:44.542 --> 12:47.000
Superstitions are real!

12:47.041 --> 12:49.375
I think we broke

12:47.041 --> 12:49.375
Ricky.

12:49.417 --> 12:52.834
Superstitions are real!

12:57.000 --> 12:58.750
[cheerful whistling]

12:58.792 --> 13:01.959
Well, we got

12:58.792 --> 13:01.959
the door fixed.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.041
Superstitions are real.

13:04.083 --> 13:05.750
Superstitions are real!

13:05.792 --> 13:07.792
But Ricky's

13:05.792 --> 13:07.792
still broken.

13:09.667 --> 13:12.709
Hey, buddy...

13:09.667 --> 13:12.709
you doing okay?

13:12.750 --> 13:16.125
I don't know.

13:12.750 --> 13:16.125
I don't know anything anymore!

13:16.166 --> 13:17.709
This is bad, Dawn.

13:17.750 --> 13:20.000
Don't worry.

13:17.750 --> 13:20.000
He'll bounce back.

13:20.041 --> 13:22.792
You know, ever since

13:20.041 --> 13:22.792
he walked under that ladder,

13:22.834 --> 13:25.333
strange, unexplainable

13:22.834 --> 13:25.333
things have been happening.

13:25.375 --> 13:26.667
They're not unexplainable.

13:26.709 --> 13:28.458
They may not have gone

13:26.709 --> 13:28.458
as we planned,

13:28.500 --> 13:30.375
but we set them all up.

13:30.417 --> 13:31.959
[static sizzle]

13:32.000 --> 13:34.291
What was that?

13:34.333 --> 13:36.959
Did you set that up too?

13:37.000 --> 13:38.458
No.

13:38.500 --> 13:40.166
[static sizzling]

13:40.208 --> 13:42.417
[all screaming]

13:42.458 --> 13:44.542
Guys, I'm sure there's

13:42.458 --> 13:44.542
an explanation for this.

13:44.583 --> 13:47.166
Don't freak out!

13:47.208 --> 13:49.125
Superstitions are real!

13:49.166 --> 13:51.250
Superstitions are real!

13:51.291 --> 13:54.458
Superstitions are real!

13:54.500 --> 13:57.083
And...now I broke everyone.

14:00.333 --> 14:03.625
So, hey, last night

14:00.333 --> 14:03.625
did you happen to run

14:03.667 --> 14:05.500
the dishwasher, vacuum,

14:03.667 --> 14:05.500
washer, and dryer

14:05.542 --> 14:07.041
all at the same time?

14:07.083 --> 14:09.083
Bingo! The big four.

14:09.125 --> 14:11.792
Well, you blew the big fuse.

14:09.125 --> 14:11.792
Everything stopped mid-cycle,

14:11.834 --> 14:13.250
and now nothing is clean.

14:13.291 --> 14:14.750
You mean

14:13.291 --> 14:14.750
it's not "Anne Clean."

14:14.792 --> 14:19.000
No, I mean it's not

14:14.792 --> 14:19.000
any kind of clean.

14:19.041 --> 14:21.875
Don't step on a crack.

14:21.917 --> 14:23.542
Don't step

14:21.917 --> 14:23.542
on a crack.

14:23.583 --> 14:25.166
I stepped on a crack!

14:25.208 --> 14:27.458
Quick! Spin around

14:25.208 --> 14:27.458
to undo the curse!

14:30.250 --> 14:33.083
Would you stop that?

14:33.125 --> 14:34.500
[sighs]

14:34.542 --> 14:36.834
- Where's Ricky?

14:34.542 --> 14:36.834
- I don't know.

14:36.875 --> 14:38.166
Last time I saw him,

14:38.208 --> 14:40.458
he was yelling

14:38.208 --> 14:40.458
at the map ball.

14:40.500 --> 14:42.542
You mean...

14:42.583 --> 14:44.959
the globe?

14:45.000 --> 14:46.458
Round.

14:46.500 --> 14:48.291
Flat.

14:48.333 --> 14:51.041
I don't know which one

14:48.333 --> 14:51.041
of you to believe anymore!

14:51.083 --> 14:52.542
Liars!

14:55.083 --> 14:57.166
This has gone

14:55.083 --> 14:57.166
too far.

14:57.208 --> 14:59.500
Ricky, superstitions

14:57.208 --> 14:59.500
aren't real.

14:59.542 --> 15:01.500
We were behind all the things

14:59.542 --> 15:01.500
that happened--

15:01.542 --> 15:02.959
the toothbrush,

15:01.542 --> 15:02.959
the shower curtain,

15:03.000 --> 15:04.834
the broken doorknob--

15:03.000 --> 15:04.834
all of it.

15:04.875 --> 15:06.500
But what about Dicky's chair

15:04.875 --> 15:06.500
breaking

15:06.542 --> 15:09.750
and Nicky's milk

15:06.542 --> 15:09.750
being spoiled?

15:09.792 --> 15:12.083
Those were supposed

15:09.792 --> 15:12.083
to happen to you.

15:12.125 --> 15:13.875
But they didn't.

15:13.917 --> 15:16.417
Yeah. They happened

15:13.917 --> 15:16.417
to us instead.

15:16.458 --> 15:18.667
Because of bad luck.

15:18.709 --> 15:20.417
It's not bad luck.

15:20.458 --> 15:21.917
Nicky didn't walk under

15:20.458 --> 15:21.917
the ladder,

15:21.959 --> 15:24.000
so why would he

15:21.959 --> 15:24.000
have bad luck?

15:24.041 --> 15:25.375
And why has nothing

15:24.041 --> 15:25.375
happened to me?

15:25.417 --> 15:27.875
Yeah. Why has nothing

15:25.417 --> 15:27.875
happened to you?

15:27.917 --> 15:30.041
But whenever

15:27.917 --> 15:30.041
we're around you,

15:30.083 --> 15:32.083
bad things happen to<i> us!</i>

15:32.125 --> 15:34.333
[Nicky]

15:32.125 --> 15:34.333
You made us tempt fate

15:32.125 --> 15:34.333
in the first place!

15:34.375 --> 15:35.625
Yeah!

15:35.667 --> 15:37.750
- Maybe you're the curse!

15:35.667 --> 15:37.750
- Yeah!

15:37.792 --> 15:40.458
Okay, that's absurd!

15:37.792 --> 15:40.458
I'm not the curse.

15:40.500 --> 15:43.208
Bad things don't happen to you

15:40.500 --> 15:43.208
just because I'm around!

15:43.250 --> 15:44.166
- Oh...

15:43.250 --> 15:44.166
- Uhh!

15:46.125 --> 15:47.375
It's the curse!

15:47.417 --> 15:49.208
How do you explain

15:47.417 --> 15:49.208
that we're down here

15:49.250 --> 15:51.834
and you're up there?

15:51.875 --> 15:53.875
I...

15:51.875 --> 15:53.875
[stammers]

15:55.291 --> 15:56.667
Tom...

15:56.709 --> 15:58.000
you didn't use

15:56.709 --> 15:58.000
furniture polish,

15:58.041 --> 15:59.750
hard wood wax,

15:58.041 --> 15:59.750
and Super Shine

15:59.792 --> 16:01.041
to clean the floors,

15:59.792 --> 16:01.041
did you?

16:01.083 --> 16:03.500
Bingo! The big three.

16:03.542 --> 16:04.917
Honey, you can't do that.

16:04.959 --> 16:06.875
It'll make the floors

16:04.959 --> 16:06.875
too slippery.

16:06.917 --> 16:09.250
I mean, I can't

16:06.917 --> 16:09.250
explain it,

16:09.291 --> 16:11.750
- but there's no way I'm the--

16:09.291 --> 16:11.750
[boys] Oh!

16:11.792 --> 16:15.583
Oh, my gosh!

16:11.792 --> 16:15.583
I am the curse!

16:19.625 --> 16:22.417
Our house has gone

16:19.625 --> 16:22.417
from bad to worse.

16:22.458 --> 16:25.500
So come on, sage,

16:22.458 --> 16:25.500
get rid of the curse!

16:27.542 --> 16:29.041
Keep your distance.

16:29.083 --> 16:31.083
Don't worry.

16:29.083 --> 16:31.083
We will.

16:31.125 --> 16:32.959
Is that my sage?

16:33.000 --> 16:36.250
Yes. I'm using it

16:33.000 --> 16:36.250
to get rid of the curse.

16:36.291 --> 16:37.417
[doorbell rings]

16:43.000 --> 16:44.917
[ding-dong]

16:44.959 --> 16:47.375
Fine. You can get it.

16:47.417 --> 16:48.667
- Whoa!

16:47.417 --> 16:48.667
- Oh!

16:50.208 --> 16:53.417
Just come in!

16:53.458 --> 16:56.750
Hey, guys.

16:53.458 --> 16:56.750
Happy Friday the 13th!

16:56.792 --> 16:57.792
[thwack]

16:57.834 --> 16:59.250
Ow!

17:01.542 --> 17:03.542
So you guys

17:01.542 --> 17:03.542
were totally right.

17:03.583 --> 17:07.625
I shouldn't let some

17:03.583 --> 17:07.625
silly superstition keep me from

17:03.583 --> 17:07.625
having a good time.

17:07.667 --> 17:10.208
So I'd love to go with you

17:07.667 --> 17:10.208
tonight to see Science Bob.

17:10.250 --> 17:11.709
I'm not going.

17:11.750 --> 17:13.250
I don't believe

17:11.750 --> 17:13.250
in science anymore.

17:13.291 --> 17:15.625
I never believed in science.

17:15.667 --> 17:16.959
You should get out of here,

17:15.667 --> 17:16.959
Mae,

17:17.000 --> 17:18.458
before something bad

17:17.000 --> 17:18.458
happens to you.

17:18.500 --> 17:20.083
Don't be crazy, Dawn!

17:20.125 --> 17:21.917
Run, Mae!

17:20.125 --> 17:21.917
Save yourself!

17:21.959 --> 17:24.250
- Dawn!

17:21.959 --> 17:24.250
- Go on, get outta here!

17:24.291 --> 17:26.917
- Get!

17:24.291 --> 17:26.917
- But my mom dropped me off--

17:24.291 --> 17:26.917
- I said git!

17:33.959 --> 17:35.583
[doorbell rings]

17:35.625 --> 17:37.458
[all]

17:35.625 --> 17:37.458
I'll get it!

17:40.834 --> 17:42.667
Hello!

17:44.125 --> 17:45.667
Science Bob?

17:45.709 --> 17:47.542
What are you

17:45.709 --> 17:47.542
doing here?

17:47.583 --> 17:49.083
I called him.

17:49.125 --> 17:50.834
I'm the one who got

17:49.125 --> 17:50.834
you guys freaked out

17:50.875 --> 17:53.917
about superstitions,

17:50.875 --> 17:53.917
so I asked Science Bob

17:53.959 --> 17:55.333
to help me set you straight.

17:55.750 --> 17:57.000
Kids, I want you to know,

17:57.041 --> 17:59.709
there's no such thing

17:57.041 --> 17:59.709
as bad luck or curses.

17:59.750 --> 18:01.750
Look, I'll prove it to you.

18:01.792 --> 18:03.166
I will stand next to Dawn,

18:03.208 --> 18:05.834
and you will see

18:03.208 --> 18:05.834
that nothing will happen.

18:05.875 --> 18:08.125
Because, as a celebrated

18:05.875 --> 18:08.125
science educator,

18:08.166 --> 18:10.500
- I can tell you beyond a--

18:08.166 --> 18:10.500
- Your coat!

18:12.959 --> 18:15.125
Oh, my gosh,

18:12.959 --> 18:15.125
my pen is leaking.

18:15.166 --> 18:18.166
That is so weird.

18:15.166 --> 18:18.166
I just bought that pen. Huh.

18:18.208 --> 18:21.458
That's okay-- luckily,

18:18.208 --> 18:21.458
I keep a spare coat in my bag.

18:21.500 --> 18:22.792
[ripping sound]

18:27.041 --> 18:30.166
Hopefully, I keep some

18:27.041 --> 18:30.166
spare pants in there as well.

18:30.208 --> 18:33.250
Ha. Science Bob's

18:30.208 --> 18:33.250
spare pants.

18:35.625 --> 18:38.500
Wow. That is so weird.

18:38.542 --> 18:41.792
Oh, my gosh.

18:38.542 --> 18:41.792
It's you...

18:41.834 --> 18:44.417
You are cursed!

18:44.458 --> 18:45.917
Bad luck is real!

18:45.959 --> 18:48.333
Yeah! It makes you

18:45.959 --> 18:48.333
question everything,

18:48.375 --> 18:50.250
like science.

18:50.291 --> 18:52.750
Yeah. I mean, if I was

18:50.291 --> 18:52.750
wrong about superstitions,

18:52.792 --> 18:54.667
what else might I be

18:52.792 --> 18:54.667
wrong about?

18:54.709 --> 18:56.959
Maybe science is all a lie!

18:57.000 --> 18:59.583
But Science Bob,

18:59.625 --> 19:03.417
you're Science Bob!

19:03.458 --> 19:05.291
Not anymore.

19:05.333 --> 19:08.583
From now on, I'm just Bob.

19:08.625 --> 19:12.000
Or maybe Barista Bob.

19:08.625 --> 19:12.000
Bob's got bills.

19:12.041 --> 19:16.291
Either way, I'm not gonna

19:12.041 --> 19:16.291
need this anymore.

19:16.333 --> 19:17.542
[kids gasp]

19:21.375 --> 19:22.583
Good job, guys.

19:22.625 --> 19:25.417
You broke Science Bob.

19:25.458 --> 19:26.834
Just Bob.

19:28.792 --> 19:31.500
I'll prove to you

19:28.792 --> 19:31.500
that science isn't a lie.

19:31.542 --> 19:34.417
Look, if we mix

19:31.542 --> 19:34.417
these two things--

19:34.458 --> 19:36.333
Stop!

19:34.458 --> 19:36.333
You can't mix those.

19:36.375 --> 19:39.250
I thought it would make

19:36.375 --> 19:39.250
a big, foamy snake thing.

19:39.291 --> 19:40.750
No...

19:44.000 --> 19:45.583
[glass clinking]

19:45.625 --> 19:48.083
If we want to make

19:45.625 --> 19:48.083
a big, foamy snake thing,

19:48.125 --> 19:52.291
you mix potassium iodide

19:48.125 --> 19:52.291
with hydrogen peroxide.

19:52.333 --> 19:53.291
Right, Bob?

19:53.333 --> 19:54.667
Whatevs.

19:54.709 --> 19:56.458
Watch.

20:04.166 --> 20:05.291
Whoa!

20:05.333 --> 20:06.959
- Cool!

20:05.333 --> 20:06.959
- Awesome!

20:07.000 --> 20:08.375
Big, foamy snake.

20:09.458 --> 20:10.709
That will happen

20:10.750 --> 20:13.041
every single time

20:10.750 --> 20:13.041
you mix them.

20:13.083 --> 20:15.709
It's almost like

20:13.083 --> 20:15.709
you can depend on it.

20:15.750 --> 20:18.000
So I guess in this case,

20:15.750 --> 20:18.000
science was right.

20:18.041 --> 20:19.583
I guess.

20:19.625 --> 20:22.375
I wonder what else

20:19.625 --> 20:22.375
science has been right about.

20:22.417 --> 20:25.625
Well, there's that cool

20:22.417 --> 20:25.625
olive trick Science Bob does.

20:25.667 --> 20:28.041
Science is always right

20:25.667 --> 20:28.041
about that.

20:28.083 --> 20:29.125
Exactly!

20:33.041 --> 20:35.875
Every time you add

20:33.041 --> 20:35.875
sodium alginate to olive juice

20:35.917 --> 20:38.875
and drop it in a calcium

20:35.917 --> 20:38.875
chloride solution,

20:38.917 --> 20:41.875
we know it always does this.

20:46.500 --> 20:51.000
And we know it will

20:46.500 --> 20:51.000
always be good eatin'!

20:52.458 --> 20:55.333
Technically,

20:52.458 --> 20:55.333
it's good drinking.

20:55.375 --> 20:58.041
You see, science can prove

20:55.375 --> 20:58.041
a lot of things,

20:58.083 --> 21:00.500
so you shouldn't

20:58.083 --> 21:00.500
give up on it.

21:02.500 --> 21:05.542
Which means... I probably

21:02.500 --> 21:05.542
shouldn't either.

21:05.583 --> 21:08.500
I guess there are some

21:05.583 --> 21:08.500
things we can know for sure.

21:08.542 --> 21:10.375
And some things

21:08.542 --> 21:10.375
we can't.

21:10.417 --> 21:17.166
Like... whether this guy's

21:10.417 --> 21:17.166
name is Bob or Just Bob.

21:17.208 --> 21:21.542
And it's actually okay to not

21:17.208 --> 21:21.542
have all the answers.

21:23.166 --> 21:24.583
Exactly.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.417
Wait a minute.

21:28.458 --> 21:29.458
Was this all a setup

21:29.500 --> 21:31.875
to trick us into

21:29.500 --> 21:31.875
feeling better?

21:31.917 --> 21:33.417
I'll never tell.

21:33.458 --> 21:35.166
But I will.

21:35.208 --> 21:36.750
We totally set it up!

21:39.291 --> 21:40.750
Look at this mess!

21:42.250 --> 21:44.959
This has "Tom Clean"

21:42.250 --> 21:44.959
written all over it.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.125
Coach is puttin' you in.

21:48.375 --> 21:50.625
But wh--what the heck

21:48.375 --> 21:50.625
happened here?

21:51.375 --> 21:52.375
Science.

21:53.834 --> 21:55.041
Science Bob?

21:56.250 --> 21:58.083
Are you responsible for this?

21:59.041 --> 22:01.041
