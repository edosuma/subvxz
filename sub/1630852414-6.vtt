WEBVTT

00:16.683 --> 00:18.810
Wait. What about your roomies?

00:18.893 --> 00:20.937
They went to the Timbiriche concert.

00:21.604 --> 00:23.356
Don't tell them I told you.

00:30.196 --> 00:31.156
Hang on.

00:33.074 --> 00:33.908
What's this?

00:33.992 --> 00:35.577
I just put Regina to sleep.

00:41.166 --> 00:42.459
-One second.
-What?

00:47.422 --> 00:48.506
Don't go anywhere.

01:08.485 --> 01:09.778
Did you miss me?

01:13.364 --> 01:14.199
Pablo?

01:29.923 --> 01:31.132
I like you.

01:33.093 --> 01:36.346
I have to pick up Regina.
She's at my mom's.

01:36.429 --> 01:39.057
I'm sorry. It's all part of being a mom.

01:39.933 --> 01:42.685
Wait, I could drive you

01:43.269 --> 01:44.437
and maybe meet Regina.

01:44.521 --> 01:46.106
No.

01:47.190 --> 01:48.066
Wow.

01:48.775 --> 01:49.651
So many nos.

01:49.734 --> 01:53.113
All I meant is it's not necessary.

01:54.405 --> 01:55.865
-I'll get a cab.
-You sure?

01:57.117 --> 01:58.743
-All right.
-Well…

02:01.955 --> 02:02.789
I have to run.

02:08.211 --> 02:09.045
Yeah.

02:11.047 --> 02:12.173
Come here.

02:17.220 --> 02:18.638
I also like you a lot.

02:20.640 --> 02:21.474
All right, bye.

02:23.309 --> 02:25.979
A NETFLIX SERIES

03:23.369 --> 03:26.539
A gap year? Are you crazy, Cecilia?

03:26.623 --> 03:30.335
I just don't want to rush into college
without knowing what I want.

03:30.418 --> 03:32.378
You got accepted into college.

03:32.462 --> 03:35.423
You'll fall behind
when it's time for your master's.

03:35.506 --> 03:37.091
I'm telling your dad.

03:37.175 --> 03:39.219
Maybe he'll talk sense into you.

03:39.302 --> 03:40.887
Tell her what Dad said.

03:40.970 --> 03:42.597
No. Better not tell me.

03:42.680 --> 03:43.932
Relax, Mom.

03:44.015 --> 03:46.184
I'm not the first or last teen

03:46.267 --> 03:48.770
to backpack through Europe
before going to college.

03:48.853 --> 03:51.481
Haven't you noticed
the state of the world lately?

03:51.564 --> 03:53.983
There's crime, violence, even terrorists.

03:54.067 --> 03:56.361
That's why Darío is going. To protect her.

03:56.444 --> 03:58.196
Is that what this is about?

03:58.279 --> 04:00.281
Going to Europe with your boyfriend?

04:00.365 --> 04:01.282
Sorry, miss.

04:01.366 --> 04:04.035
You're not ruining your future
over some guy.

04:04.118 --> 04:05.620
I'll discuss this with your dad.

04:08.748 --> 04:10.166
<i>It's no big deal?</i>

04:10.250 --> 04:13.044
Ceci wants to drop out
for a honeymoon with her boyfriend.

04:13.127 --> 04:15.380
You also went on a trip before college.

04:15.463 --> 04:17.799
I went to France for a summer
to learn French,

04:18.466 --> 04:19.634
not to follow some boy.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.262
<i>You and I need to be on the same page.</i>

04:22.929 --> 04:25.890
Am I playing the bad cop
to your good cop now?

04:25.974 --> 04:27.976
Okay, we're on the same page.

04:28.059 --> 04:28.935
<i>Thanks.</i>

04:29.018 --> 04:31.396
You should talk to Ceci, then.

04:31.479 --> 04:32.730
Why me?

04:33.439 --> 04:35.441
So you learn not to be a pushover.

04:35.525 --> 04:36.693
<i>I have to go now.</i>

04:37.193 --> 04:38.820
Let me know once you talk to her.

04:42.365 --> 04:43.950
Save it until you fall in love.

04:55.712 --> 04:58.298
-I don't get why we're here.
-What?

04:58.381 --> 04:59.632
We're working out, man.

04:59.716 --> 05:03.928
It's the best thing for depression,
and it boosts testosterone levels.

05:04.012 --> 05:06.639
Juanqui, we have to jump-start
your sex drive.

05:06.723 --> 05:09.183
My sex drive is fine, thank you.

05:09.267 --> 05:10.310
Yeah, right.

05:10.393 --> 05:12.103
Why don't you pick a class?

05:12.895 --> 05:13.896
Karate.

05:13.980 --> 05:14.897
Zumba.

05:14.981 --> 05:16.607
It's packed with women.

05:16.691 --> 05:19.527
Hitting the gym is step one
in getting over a divorce.

05:19.610 --> 05:21.362
I'm not divorced yet.

05:21.446 --> 05:23.489
Just do as I say. Trust me.

05:23.573 --> 05:24.741
Pick a class.

05:27.577 --> 05:28.453
Boxing.

05:29.120 --> 05:31.664
You don't get it. Look, Zumba.

05:32.498 --> 05:34.250
See? Zumba again.

05:34.334 --> 05:38.046
<i>We want to get to know</i>
<i>and connect with women.</i>

05:38.629 --> 05:41.215
We have developed a network--

05:41.299 --> 05:43.092
-Stop there.
-Now what?

05:43.176 --> 05:45.636
A good pitch is short and concise.

05:46.179 --> 05:48.556
You keep veering off-topic.

05:48.639 --> 05:49.849
You're too distracted.

05:50.641 --> 05:52.226
Are you thinking about a guy?

05:52.310 --> 05:53.144
Well…

05:53.644 --> 05:55.897
Are you going to tell me who he is?

05:55.980 --> 05:58.274
Ferrán, the owner of the co-work.

05:58.358 --> 05:59.442
I see.

06:00.109 --> 06:02.070
I've run into him a few times.

06:02.153 --> 06:03.029
So?

06:03.112 --> 06:06.574
I don't know. He's too flirty.
He flirts with everyone.

06:06.657 --> 06:08.284
I hadn't noticed.

06:08.368 --> 06:10.536
Of course you didn't.
You can't read people.

06:10.620 --> 06:13.831
That is a vital skill
in the art of pitching.

06:13.915 --> 06:16.250
You don't need to worry about that.

06:16.334 --> 06:18.211
I'm sure Ferrán is pretty cool.

06:18.294 --> 06:20.546
Cool isn't a good parameter

06:21.089 --> 06:22.799
when reading people.

06:22.882 --> 06:26.135
Why should I learn to pitch
when you're so good at it?

06:26.219 --> 06:28.429
Because all partners
must be ready for everything.

06:28.513 --> 06:30.348
I'm ready, don't worry.

06:30.431 --> 06:33.643
Did I tell you I won
a national speech contest?

06:33.726 --> 06:35.353
Back in elementary school.

06:35.937 --> 06:38.689
Even you were speech champ
back in elementary school.

06:39.524 --> 06:41.567
He's such a douchebag. Look.

06:42.318 --> 06:46.030
Look at the way he stands.
I'll unmask him.

06:46.114 --> 06:49.242
Guys like him are my specialty.
You'll see.

06:54.747 --> 06:56.749
Ferrán, hi.

06:56.833 --> 06:58.292
Ana, looking beautiful.

06:58.376 --> 07:01.879
Thanks. I haven't forgotten
we're due for a coffee.

07:02.547 --> 07:04.590
How about tomorrow at 8:00 p.m.?

07:04.674 --> 07:08.052
Sorry, I have an investor meeting.
It's going to run very long.

07:08.136 --> 07:09.387
You know how it is.

07:09.470 --> 07:10.972
How about Friday?

07:11.055 --> 07:13.182
It's poker night at the co-work.

07:13.266 --> 07:14.183
You should come.

07:14.267 --> 07:15.935
Ferrán, they're waiting.

07:16.018 --> 07:19.397
-Shoot, that's right. So are you coming?
-Yes.

07:19.480 --> 07:20.648
-Nice seeing you.
-Yes.

07:24.235 --> 07:25.278
Not a single word.

07:28.448 --> 07:31.659
If you want to be beautiful,
you've got to work those bodies!

07:31.742 --> 07:35.830
One, two, three, four!

07:36.330 --> 07:39.292
One, two, three, four…

07:39.375 --> 07:41.002
Sorry!

07:41.085 --> 07:42.336
No worries. I'm fine.

07:43.004 --> 07:45.923
Lift those arms! Show me your smiles!

07:50.761 --> 07:52.430
-Sorry!
-You know what?

07:52.513 --> 07:55.600
Just forget about the steps
and have fun with it.

07:55.683 --> 07:57.894
That's right.

08:07.153 --> 08:09.238
PABLO
ROMANTIC DATE, TONIGHT?

08:09.322 --> 08:11.491
CYNTHIA
MY PLACE? I'LL COOK FOR YOU.

08:14.744 --> 08:18.080
PABLO
YOU LOOKED BEAUTIFUL YESTERDAY.

08:19.665 --> 08:20.791
Tonight, my place?

08:21.709 --> 08:23.961
I can't. I have Regina.

08:24.045 --> 08:26.005
Why don't the three of us do something?

08:27.632 --> 08:30.092
You, Regina, and me?

08:30.176 --> 08:32.094
You seem so scared.

08:32.178 --> 08:35.890
No, it's just that she hasn't been
feeling well lately.

08:35.973 --> 08:38.893
In that case, I can help.
Anything you need.

08:38.976 --> 08:41.187
Thanks, but I've got it.

08:41.270 --> 08:42.230
Are you sure?

08:42.313 --> 08:43.523
Some other time.

08:43.606 --> 08:46.025
-All right.
-Yeah, okay.

08:51.614 --> 08:52.907
<i>Let me guess.</i>

08:52.990 --> 08:55.159
Recently divorced with teenage kids.

08:55.243 --> 08:56.244
How did you know?

08:56.744 --> 08:58.329
It's easy to tell around here.

08:58.412 --> 09:01.541
The longer they've been divorced,
the better shape they're in.

09:03.209 --> 09:04.043
Look.

09:04.585 --> 09:07.129
That guy there,
he's been divorced three years.

09:08.005 --> 09:10.841
That guy back there, maybe five years.

09:12.260 --> 09:14.637
That girl behind you? Two years.

09:14.720 --> 09:16.681
We all come here to reinvent ourselves.

09:16.764 --> 09:19.517
I guess you've been divorced
for many, many years.

09:21.143 --> 09:23.688
-Nice to meet you. I'm Fernanda.
-Juan Carlos.

09:24.814 --> 09:27.108
Working out isn't my thing.

09:27.191 --> 09:28.776
I'm dying for some chilaquiles.

09:28.859 --> 09:31.654
That's an easy fix.
Let's go get breakfast.

09:32.238 --> 09:34.407
I mean, unless you have to
watch your kids.

09:38.995 --> 09:42.164
-Speak of the devil.
-Please, answer it.

09:42.248 --> 09:45.835
But next time we see each other,
you'll take me to dinner, deal?

09:45.918 --> 09:47.336
It'll be a pleasure.

09:48.337 --> 09:49.255
See you around.

09:53.467 --> 09:54.969
Ceci, what's up?

09:55.886 --> 09:57.305
Yeah, your mom and I talked.

09:57.805 --> 09:59.599
<i>Didn't you say your dad was cool?</i>

09:59.682 --> 10:02.935
Well, yeah, but my mom got in his head.

10:03.019 --> 10:06.355
She's obsessed with me
getting a PhD before I'm 25.

10:07.023 --> 10:09.984
They won't give you permission or money?

10:10.860 --> 10:12.069
You're not underage.

10:12.153 --> 10:14.030
If you pay for the trip,

10:14.113 --> 10:15.573
they can't actually stop you.

10:16.741 --> 10:18.117
<i>I'm glad you're here.</i>

10:18.200 --> 10:20.036
What's this about poker night?

10:20.119 --> 10:22.580
-We do it once a month.
-What do I need to enter?

10:22.663 --> 10:24.081
Pay the buy-in,

10:24.165 --> 10:27.501
and show self-confidence
because you'll be up against Ferrán.

10:28.919 --> 10:30.546
He's on a three-month winning streak.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.923
<i>We won't have any competition.</i>

10:33.007 --> 10:35.426
Clay treatments are great,

10:35.509 --> 10:38.429
not just for the skin
but also for the soul.

10:38.512 --> 10:40.514
-Where are we testing these?
-In Valle de Bravo.

10:41.098 --> 10:42.683
I promise you'll love it.

10:42.767 --> 10:45.353
All right, I trust you.

10:46.145 --> 10:48.981
Cheers to a partner like no other.

10:50.274 --> 10:51.275
Cheers.

10:54.445 --> 10:55.655
Do you really trust me?

10:57.657 --> 10:58.866
100%.

11:07.333 --> 11:09.627
I think it's getting late.

11:09.710 --> 11:11.587
Yeah, I should get going.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.964
-Take care. We'll talk tomorrow.
-See you.

11:14.048 --> 11:15.633
-Sorry.
-No, it's fine.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.401
I forgot I had Regina tonight.

11:34.610 --> 11:35.444
Come in.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.532
I'm sorry. I feel…

11:41.617 --> 11:42.451
terrible.

11:42.952 --> 11:44.036
Don't worry.

11:46.539 --> 11:49.500
You look great in that outfit.

11:50.209 --> 11:51.085
Thanks.

11:51.585 --> 11:54.213
I better change
into something more appropriate.

11:57.758 --> 11:59.510
<i>My savings aren't enough.</i>

12:00.094 --> 12:01.679
No need to sell your clothes.

12:01.762 --> 12:04.265
Invest in Surfcoin.
You'd triple it in a month.

12:05.391 --> 12:07.226
What exactly is Surfcoin?

12:10.020 --> 12:11.439
It's cryptocurrency.

12:11.522 --> 12:14.358
Everyone is investing,
even Dad and Uncle Víctor.

12:14.442 --> 12:15.401
Really?

12:18.612 --> 12:21.323
I just want to make sure
your date doesn't run off.

12:21.407 --> 12:22.700
She's not "my date."

12:22.783 --> 12:24.326
We're just getting dinner.

12:25.369 --> 12:28.622
I can always tell her to bring a friend.
You need a girlfriend.

12:28.706 --> 12:29.582
Right, Matilde?

12:29.665 --> 12:31.959
-That's right, sir.
-Thanks for that.

12:32.042 --> 12:34.545
You know what?
You could use a fresh haircut.

12:34.628 --> 12:38.048
You also need new clothes
and some cologne.

12:38.132 --> 12:39.633
What's wrong with my cologne?

12:39.717 --> 12:43.012
-Do I smell bad?
-No, sir. Your cologne smells fine.

12:43.095 --> 12:45.806
-Thanks.
-Please, you smell like a baby.

12:45.890 --> 12:48.225
Sex appeal begins with your scent.

12:48.309 --> 12:50.394
-Isn't that right, Matilde?
-Yes, sir.

12:50.478 --> 12:51.645
Told you.

12:54.315 --> 12:56.400
I saw it and couldn't resist.

12:57.401 --> 12:58.486
Don't you love it?

12:58.569 --> 13:00.696
Regina is at a different stage.

13:00.780 --> 13:03.115
We're giving her simpler toys

13:03.199 --> 13:04.950
so she can focus better.

13:05.910 --> 13:06.786
Oh, I'm sorry.

13:07.369 --> 13:08.746
Maybe I can return it.

13:08.829 --> 13:12.583
No, we can just save it
for when she's older.

13:13.209 --> 13:14.335
Thank you so much.

13:16.128 --> 13:18.130
<i>I feel like I let you down.</i>

13:18.214 --> 13:19.882
I mixed up Regi's schedule again.

13:19.965 --> 13:21.383
Seriously, don't worry.

13:21.467 --> 13:23.552
I have to get back to the office.

13:24.094 --> 13:25.596
Besides, Regis needs you.

13:26.388 --> 13:28.974
Cynthia, I know
this must be difficult for you.

13:29.809 --> 13:32.978
I get it if you want
to reconsider all of this.

13:33.479 --> 13:34.605
Pablo, I don't--

13:37.441 --> 13:38.651
I'm sorry. I have to go.

13:40.861 --> 13:42.071
Hey, no.

13:42.863 --> 13:43.781
Let's go.

13:46.575 --> 13:49.620
We almost kissed. It was so wrong.

13:49.703 --> 13:53.207
I saw it coming miles away.
What's so bad about it?

13:53.290 --> 13:55.835
It would ruin my business

13:55.918 --> 13:58.170
and, even worse,
my relationship with Mariana.

13:58.254 --> 14:00.339
Mariana would understand.

14:00.422 --> 14:02.341
She won't be pleased with me

14:02.424 --> 14:05.219
dating Juan Carlos's brother.

14:05.302 --> 14:06.971
You can't spend your life

14:07.054 --> 14:09.431
trying to please others.

14:09.515 --> 14:13.269
She's not just anyone. She's my kid.
I don't want to mess things up again.

14:14.311 --> 14:16.021
I'm calling off the trip.

14:16.814 --> 14:18.274
No, Teresa.

14:18.858 --> 14:19.942
Look, darling.

14:20.025 --> 14:23.320
When you feel like
you can't hold back anymore,

14:23.404 --> 14:25.531
just stick this in there,

14:25.614 --> 14:26.907
and you'll be golden.

14:27.700 --> 14:28.909
What's this egg thing?

14:28.993 --> 14:31.245
A self-control crystal.

14:31.328 --> 14:34.498
It makes you less horny so you can focus.

14:34.582 --> 14:38.002
-No way, Mom.
-I'm speaking from experience.

14:38.085 --> 14:39.253
Of course you are.

14:47.177 --> 14:48.512
I'm all in.

14:51.724 --> 14:52.641
Same here.

15:02.568 --> 15:03.944
No, I fold.

15:06.530 --> 15:07.448
Two pair.

15:08.198 --> 15:09.325
Show your cards.

15:10.159 --> 15:11.160
I have nothing.

15:14.330 --> 15:15.331
Me neither.

15:15.414 --> 15:16.624
Mariana?

15:18.667 --> 15:20.294
-You could've won.
-Yeah.

15:20.794 --> 15:21.629
I was bluffing.

15:21.712 --> 15:24.506
See? You need to learn to read people.

15:24.590 --> 15:25.674
You're right.

15:26.175 --> 15:27.009
Now what?

15:27.092 --> 15:28.844
I signed us up for the tournament.

15:28.928 --> 15:30.220
No.

15:30.304 --> 15:33.015
I'll teach you all I know
about reading people.

15:33.098 --> 15:35.559
That way, you'll learn how to pitch,

15:35.643 --> 15:38.395
and you'll see I was right about Ferrán.

15:39.480 --> 15:42.024
He's my boss, and I love him,
but Ana is right.

15:42.107 --> 15:43.484
He's a shameless flirt.

15:46.320 --> 15:47.821
Take notes and learn.

15:47.905 --> 15:49.156
<i>Lesson number one.</i>

15:49.657 --> 15:51.659
<i>Human communication</i>

15:51.742 --> 15:54.036
<i>is 90% body language.</i>

15:54.119 --> 15:55.829
<i>The rest doesn't matter.</i>

15:55.913 --> 15:58.290
<i>Observation is key.</i>

15:58.374 --> 15:59.375
Hi.

15:59.458 --> 16:01.210
Did you know

16:01.293 --> 16:04.505
you frown a little
whenever you're worried?

16:04.588 --> 16:05.839
You look very handsome.

16:08.050 --> 16:09.510
<i>Lesson number two.</i>

16:09.593 --> 16:11.553
<i>There's no victory without strategy.</i>

16:11.637 --> 16:14.473
<i>In order to defeat your enemy,</i>
<i>prepare yourself</i>

16:14.974 --> 16:15.849
<i>and plan.</i>

16:17.101 --> 16:19.561
<i>Lesson number three. Know your enemy.</i>

16:20.145 --> 16:21.438
<i>Do your research</i>

16:21.939 --> 16:24.817
<i>and figure out</i>
<i>his strengths and weaknesses</i>

16:24.900 --> 16:26.193
<i>to gain an advantage.</i>

16:26.276 --> 16:27.111
That's my mom.

16:28.862 --> 16:30.572
You don't look like her.

16:31.198 --> 16:34.994
-Do you look more like your dad?
-I don't know. I've never met him.

16:35.828 --> 16:36.745
I see.

16:38.622 --> 16:40.207
<i>She's my partner.</i>

16:40.290 --> 16:43.836
Mixing love and business
is like adding milk to orange juice.

16:44.378 --> 16:47.089
What do you think?
I should cancel the trip, right?

16:47.172 --> 16:49.925
I'm not sure about that, sir.
Business is business.

16:50.426 --> 16:52.553
If I were you, I'd set clear boundaries.

16:54.680 --> 16:55.597
Here you go.

16:56.890 --> 16:58.976
I added a splash of whiskey.

17:00.477 --> 17:01.520
Think about it.

17:02.604 --> 17:03.856
Don't screw up.

17:05.774 --> 17:08.318
Thank you for watching her
on such short notice.

17:08.902 --> 17:11.196
Didn't you and Cynthia have plans?

17:11.280 --> 17:12.114
Not anymore.

17:12.197 --> 17:13.866
I don't think it's going to work.

17:14.408 --> 17:17.244
I know Cynthia
has been trying really hard, but…

17:18.912 --> 17:20.664
Listen, have you ever…

17:21.874 --> 17:23.083
Forget it.

17:24.460 --> 17:25.961
Have I ever what?

17:26.587 --> 17:29.423
Have you ever imagined
what it would be like

17:29.506 --> 17:32.176
if Regina had come
at a different stage in our lives?

17:32.259 --> 17:36.388
Many times. And to be honest,
it makes me feel like a terrible mom.

17:37.639 --> 17:38.766
That makes two of us.

17:38.849 --> 17:41.351
I think all parents feel this way.

17:41.435 --> 17:42.728
Especially at our age.

17:43.604 --> 17:44.813
You're right.

17:44.897 --> 17:45.939
Come here.

17:50.069 --> 17:53.030
It hasn't been easy for me
to start dating again either.

17:53.113 --> 17:56.033
I'm scared of bringing
someone new into Regina's life.

17:56.116 --> 17:59.244
I think the most important thing
in every new relationship

17:59.328 --> 18:01.413
is to figure out how to set boundaries.

18:04.166 --> 18:05.250
It's your size.

18:06.418 --> 18:08.420
Fine, but it's not my style.

18:08.504 --> 18:10.631
Speaking of style, how is Rorros going?

18:11.632 --> 18:13.217
You haven't told me much.

18:13.300 --> 18:14.718
Surfcoin just crashed!

18:16.303 --> 18:18.305
I didn't know
you were interested in crypto.

18:18.388 --> 18:21.225
-It was obvious it would crash.
-What?

18:27.606 --> 18:28.482
What?

18:29.108 --> 18:30.859
Okay, write this down.

18:30.943 --> 18:32.820
Rule number one. Be a little late.

18:32.903 --> 18:33.987
No.

18:36.740 --> 18:39.159
It's very important
that you choose the wine.

18:39.243 --> 18:40.911
It shows you're in control,

18:40.994 --> 18:42.704
and you know what you want.

18:42.788 --> 18:44.957
Don't talk about your ex.

18:45.040 --> 18:46.959
Avoid the subject completely.

18:47.709 --> 18:48.961
And most importantly,

18:49.461 --> 18:50.838
be self-confident.

18:51.421 --> 18:53.006
<i>I just lost everything!</i>

18:53.090 --> 18:55.634
-My trip is over because of you.
-I'm sorry, Ceci.

18:55.717 --> 18:57.803
I didn't want you to leave.

18:57.886 --> 19:01.014
Our family is a mess right now,
and I don't want to be alone.

19:01.765 --> 19:02.891
I need you.

19:11.024 --> 19:14.236
<i>Breathe, focus, and most of all,</i>

19:14.736 --> 19:15.988
<i>keep your eyes on him.</i>

20:03.577 --> 20:05.078
-Fold.
-Show your cards.

20:15.881 --> 20:16.965
Pair of aces wins.

20:22.596 --> 20:23.805
Congratulations.

20:25.015 --> 20:26.225
Thank you so much.

20:26.308 --> 20:29.603
That was so much fun.
I feel I know Ferrán a little better now.

20:29.686 --> 20:30.771
Excuse me.

20:31.355 --> 20:33.857
I'd like to congratulate my nemesis.

20:37.361 --> 20:40.239
Is she blind or what?
That douche got away with it.

20:40.739 --> 20:43.283
Either he's a great liar,
or he's actually nice.

20:43.367 --> 20:44.534
No, I don't think so.

20:45.535 --> 20:46.870
Dora told me something.

20:46.954 --> 20:49.998
It's not the first time
Ferrán's dated someone at the co-work

20:50.082 --> 20:52.709
and then coincidentally
been offered a partnership.

20:55.170 --> 20:56.463
That's interesting.

20:57.089 --> 20:59.383
You should figure things out

20:59.466 --> 21:01.093
and meet me there at some point.

21:01.176 --> 21:04.721
-Thanks for being supportive, Darío.
-All right, Ceci, I'm sorry.

21:04.805 --> 21:06.098
I was out of line.

21:06.598 --> 21:10.727
I'm just mad our plans are ruined
because of your little brother's tantrum.

21:10.811 --> 21:14.648
-You should go if you want to.
-The whole point was going together.

21:16.024 --> 21:18.568
I swear, I hate my mom.

21:18.652 --> 21:20.153
Talk to your dad.

21:20.237 --> 21:22.614
You said he was on board at first, right?

21:22.698 --> 21:25.617
Parents like it
when you talk to them face-to-face.

21:29.496 --> 21:32.082
Hey, I'd like to apologize.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.334
For winning at poker.

21:34.418 --> 21:37.462
I don't think I've been upfront
with the Regina stuff.

21:37.546 --> 21:40.048
I don't know if you've noticed--

21:40.132 --> 21:42.342
You don't want me to get close to Regina.

21:44.428 --> 21:47.097
I didn't really know how to tell you,

21:47.180 --> 21:50.851
but I'm a little scared of bringing
someone new into her life.

21:50.934 --> 21:53.729
I'm sorry if I pressured you.

21:54.771 --> 21:57.316
And I want you to know
that I'm okay with it.

21:57.899 --> 21:58.817
I know,

21:58.900 --> 22:00.569
but I do want you to meet her.

22:01.737 --> 22:05.699
As long as you accept my boundaries.

22:06.283 --> 22:07.367
Yes, anything.

22:07.868 --> 22:10.746
Let's start with you not buying her toys

22:10.829 --> 22:12.956
without consulting me first.

22:13.040 --> 22:14.833
I knew you didn't like that!

22:14.916 --> 22:16.668
Okay, you got it.

22:17.753 --> 22:20.380
So date for three? Tomorrow?

22:20.464 --> 22:21.506
I'm in.

22:21.590 --> 22:22.549
Great.

22:22.632 --> 22:25.469
-You didn't say it was for couples.
-I didn't know.

22:26.219 --> 22:27.220
Sorry.

22:27.304 --> 22:28.764
Close your eyes.

22:28.847 --> 22:32.517
Place your hand on your partner's chest.

22:32.601 --> 22:34.269
Feel their heartbeat.

22:36.480 --> 22:37.356
Don't worry.

22:38.940 --> 22:41.651
Good. Now take some clay.

22:42.319 --> 22:46.573
Place it on your partner's chest.

22:46.656 --> 22:49.534
Slowly spread the clay over their body.

22:49.618 --> 22:50.452
Oh shit.

23:04.800 --> 23:05.801
<i>Rule number one.</i>

23:05.884 --> 23:07.094
<i>Be a little late.</i>

23:08.720 --> 23:09.721
Hi, sorry.

23:09.805 --> 23:10.639
I'm so sorry.

23:10.722 --> 23:13.934
-My meeting ran long.
-It's fine. I just got here.

23:14.017 --> 23:16.311
-Good afternoon. Welcome.
-Thanks.

23:16.395 --> 23:17.771
Can I get you a drink?

23:18.397 --> 23:20.440
<i>It's very important</i>
<i>that you choose the wine.</i>

23:21.274 --> 23:22.609
May I?

23:23.110 --> 23:24.194
Sure.

23:25.737 --> 23:28.073
We'd like a bottle of Insignia.

23:28.156 --> 23:29.241
-Yes.
-Thank you.

23:30.534 --> 23:32.202
What do you do, Juan Carlos?

23:32.285 --> 23:34.996
I have a company
that sells precision screws.

23:35.497 --> 23:37.749
-How about you?
-I'm an architect.

23:38.750 --> 23:42.754
Sorry to be blunt,
but how long ago did you get divorced?

23:42.838 --> 23:46.007
<i>Don't talk about your ex.</i>
<i>Avoid the subject completely.</i>

23:46.091 --> 23:47.926
Why don't we order?

23:53.056 --> 23:55.267
Marcela has a good impression of you.

23:55.892 --> 23:57.936
She tells me you'd make a good partner.

23:58.019 --> 23:59.312
Partner?

23:59.396 --> 24:02.732
I'd like to give you another chance.

24:04.526 --> 24:06.236
Tomorrow night, my place?

24:06.319 --> 24:08.530
I'm busy tomorrow night, but…

24:08.613 --> 24:10.282
You're a businessman.

24:11.616 --> 24:14.703
Second chances don't come every day.

24:14.786 --> 24:16.496
Take it or leave it.

24:17.998 --> 24:18.832
I'll take it.

24:19.833 --> 24:22.836
Very well. I'll see you tomorrow, then.

24:22.919 --> 24:24.921
-I'll text you the location.
-Okay.

24:28.467 --> 24:30.760
I normally don't date guys from the gym.

24:30.844 --> 24:34.473
You never know what's behind
those leggings or muscles.

24:36.266 --> 24:37.601
But you're different.

24:38.101 --> 24:41.521
The way you speak,
the wine you like, the clothes you wear,

24:41.605 --> 24:42.981
your sense of humor.

24:43.607 --> 24:46.943
You don't talk about your past,
which means you're over it.

24:48.945 --> 24:49.779
So

24:50.614 --> 24:51.865
your place or mine?

24:55.118 --> 24:55.952
I'm sorry.

24:57.662 --> 24:59.039
-It's my daughter.
-Oh.

25:01.291 --> 25:02.959
-Ceci, what's up?
<i>-Dad?</i>

25:03.543 --> 25:05.545
<i>We need to talk. It's urgent.</i>

25:05.629 --> 25:08.798
<i>-Is something wrong?</i>
-No, I want to talk about my trip.

25:09.382 --> 25:12.385
-Ceci, we already talked about it.
-I need to talk in person.

25:12.469 --> 25:14.638
Okay, but not right now. I'm busy.

25:14.721 --> 25:16.681
It can wait until tomorrow.

25:16.765 --> 25:19.184
-No, but, Dad--
-Ceci, tomorrow.

25:20.936 --> 25:23.438
<i>And most importantly, be self-confident.</i>

25:28.235 --> 25:29.194
Your place.

25:34.574 --> 25:37.327
FLIGHTS
SEARCH

25:41.248 --> 25:42.791
Embrace your partner.

25:43.583 --> 25:47.212
Melt into their body as if you were one.

25:48.004 --> 25:49.673
Repeat after me.

25:50.715 --> 25:55.262
"Thank you for the intimacy
we have just shared."

25:56.429 --> 25:58.974
Thank you for the intimacy…

25:59.057 --> 26:00.976
…we've just shared.

27:00.118 --> 27:01.828
No, wait.

27:01.911 --> 27:03.788
-What?
-I can't. I'm sorry.

27:04.789 --> 27:07.751
Please, don't take this the wrong way.
You're a stunning woman, but

27:08.627 --> 27:09.669
I lied to you.

27:11.004 --> 27:12.756
I'm not over my ex.

27:13.256 --> 27:14.841
I'm not even divorced yet.

27:14.924 --> 27:17.093
My brother forced me to wear this shirt.

27:17.177 --> 27:19.387
The wine thing was true. I love wine.

27:20.889 --> 27:22.015
I'm so sorry.

27:23.308 --> 27:25.518
It's a shame because I like you a lot.

27:28.396 --> 27:29.939
Thanks for being honest,

27:30.565 --> 27:31.650
I guess.

27:35.820 --> 27:36.905
<i>I can't believe this.</i>

27:36.988 --> 27:38.990
You betrayed our trust, Ceci.

27:39.074 --> 27:41.743
-It was just for emergencies.
-This is an emergency.

27:42.327 --> 27:44.746
The tickets would've been
more expensive later.

27:44.829 --> 27:46.039
What was your plan?

27:46.122 --> 27:48.583
To call us from the plane or what?

27:48.667 --> 27:51.711
That's why I wanted to talk,
but you said you were busy.

27:53.004 --> 27:56.716
-Did you forget that we said no?
-Mom, I'm a legal adult.

27:56.800 --> 27:59.844
That's wonderful, missy.
In that case, you don't need this.

28:01.054 --> 28:02.555
You're paying for the tickets.

28:07.143 --> 28:08.269
Where were you?

28:09.396 --> 28:11.356
-Huh?
-She said you were busy, doing what?

28:12.273 --> 28:13.817
I was at the office.

28:13.900 --> 28:15.193
Outside office hours?

28:15.276 --> 28:16.611
Wait just a minute.

28:17.278 --> 28:20.156
You want space from me,
but I owe you explanations?

28:20.240 --> 28:22.575
When it comes to our kids, I think so.

28:25.829 --> 28:27.664
-You were with someone.
-No.

28:28.289 --> 28:29.124
Well, yeah.

28:29.708 --> 28:30.709
Nothing happened.

28:32.210 --> 28:33.253
I couldn't do it.

28:33.753 --> 28:35.422
Not even with a pill?

28:35.505 --> 28:38.591
That's not the point. I didn't dare.

28:38.675 --> 28:41.052
We're not divorced yet,
and you're already--

28:41.136 --> 28:42.011
Hang on.

28:42.095 --> 28:45.432
You didn't seem upset
when you threw yourself at Ferrán.

28:45.515 --> 28:47.642
Well, now we're even. Don't you think?

28:48.935 --> 28:50.353
I think I should leave.

28:55.692 --> 28:59.404
I'm sorry for canceling.
It's a last-minute thing.

28:59.487 --> 29:03.158
Isn't there any way for you
to reschedule your meeting?

29:03.241 --> 29:04.868
I had everything ready.

29:04.951 --> 29:07.370
I tried, but you know how Ana is.

29:08.371 --> 29:09.873
You have a meeting with Ana?

29:10.498 --> 29:11.458
And Marcela.

29:11.541 --> 29:13.418
They have a partnership proposal.

29:13.501 --> 29:15.336
-Didn't she mention it?
-Yeah.

29:15.420 --> 29:18.590
She told me about it.
It must've slipped my mind.

29:21.384 --> 29:23.344
I have an idea.

29:23.928 --> 29:24.804
What?

29:25.305 --> 29:28.224
Pablo, surprises make me really nervous.

29:28.308 --> 29:31.603
Cynthia, I really care about you,
and I don't want to lose you.

29:31.686 --> 29:34.606
I'll do everything I can
to make sure this works.

29:35.398 --> 29:36.274
Are you ready?

29:40.987 --> 29:42.655
Organization is key.

29:48.077 --> 29:50.538
I promise, no more mix-ups like last time.

29:51.164 --> 29:52.874
Last few times, actually.

29:54.584 --> 29:55.502
What?

29:55.585 --> 29:57.420
There's a little issue there.

29:58.421 --> 30:03.092
You can't drive Regina to daycare
while we're having breakfast.

30:03.176 --> 30:04.385
I'm such a moron.

30:05.011 --> 30:06.054
No.

30:07.013 --> 30:08.056
Don't worry.

30:08.139 --> 30:09.891
I have a master's in organization.

30:15.104 --> 30:15.939
Look.

30:16.439 --> 30:19.234
Red is Pablo and Regina time.

30:19.317 --> 30:21.945
Yellow is Pablo and Cynthia time.

30:22.028 --> 30:23.696
And blue is for us three.

30:23.780 --> 30:25.865
What time is it now?

30:39.379 --> 30:40.255
So?

30:40.755 --> 30:41.714
How did it go?

30:42.799 --> 30:44.592
It went well… It went bad.

30:45.635 --> 30:47.887
-We went back to her place.
-That's great!

30:47.971 --> 30:50.014
But then I told her I wasn't over Ana.

30:50.598 --> 30:52.851
-It was bad.
-Dude, I told you not to--

30:52.934 --> 30:55.103
Yeah, I know. It's just that--

30:56.938 --> 30:58.857
-I saw her.
-Who?

30:58.940 --> 30:59.941
I saw Ana!

31:01.150 --> 31:03.945
-What do you mean?
-I looked around, and she was there.

31:04.028 --> 31:05.363
Ana was there. I saw her!

31:05.989 --> 31:08.908
I think you only get to love
one person in your life.

31:09.617 --> 31:11.160
For me, that person is Ana.

31:12.370 --> 31:13.830
She'll never forgive me.

31:18.334 --> 31:19.252
Oh brother.

31:20.086 --> 31:21.170
You're an idiot.

31:21.963 --> 31:24.507
Now you have to win Ana back

31:25.091 --> 31:26.509
with all your dorkiness.

31:28.678 --> 31:30.305
What's up with you?

31:30.388 --> 31:31.347
Nothing.

31:32.557 --> 31:36.686
-Did your business trip to Valle go wrong?
-So much mud. I'll tell you later.

31:36.769 --> 31:38.062
Focus.

31:38.146 --> 31:41.482
Right now, you should be
coming up with a dorky idea

31:41.566 --> 31:44.068
because we're going
straight to Ana's house.

31:47.405 --> 31:49.449
I have the perfect thing.

31:58.666 --> 32:00.335
-Hello.
-Hi.

32:00.960 --> 32:03.963
I hope it's not a problem
that I invited myself.

32:04.047 --> 32:05.340
Not at all.

32:06.549 --> 32:09.344
I meant to invite you, actually.

32:09.427 --> 32:12.096
-But I thought you had Regina.
-I see.

32:13.014 --> 32:14.140
Please, come in.

32:14.223 --> 32:15.683
-Thanks.
-Excuse me.

32:22.523 --> 32:23.733
Please, have a seat.

32:23.816 --> 32:26.152
-Would you like some wine?
-Yeah.

32:26.235 --> 32:27.695
-Yes.
-Sure, thanks.

32:27.779 --> 32:28.655
All right.

32:31.783 --> 32:33.493
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

32:35.870 --> 32:39.374
-Is it me, or is Ana acting weird?
-Really weird.

32:41.793 --> 32:44.754
I don't think she's thrilled
about me being here.

32:48.758 --> 32:50.802
I'll go talk to her, okay?

32:50.885 --> 32:52.011
I'll wait outside.

32:52.553 --> 32:54.347
All right, yes.

32:54.430 --> 32:55.264
Thanks.

33:00.311 --> 33:01.229
Where's Ferrán?

33:01.896 --> 33:06.025
First, you don't trust Ferrán,
and now he's a possible partner?

33:06.109 --> 33:07.902
Well, I changed my mind.

33:07.986 --> 33:09.779
What's your deal with Ferrán?

33:16.160 --> 33:17.662
Okay, yes.

33:18.997 --> 33:22.125
All I wanted is for you to realize
he's a douchebag.

33:23.209 --> 33:26.379
He walks around the co-work
flirting with everyone

33:26.462 --> 33:29.549
and makes all women think
he's interested in them.

33:29.632 --> 33:31.092
It's him.

33:31.843 --> 33:36.014
He's the hot coworker
you wanted to ask out. It's him, right?

33:36.764 --> 33:40.727
At least I can say
I taught you how to read people.

33:40.810 --> 33:45.648
So you coached me to drive me away
from Ferrán and keep him for yourself?

33:45.732 --> 33:46.566
No.

33:46.649 --> 33:48.985
I won't deny

33:49.068 --> 33:51.195
it was nice to feel wanted.

33:51.779 --> 33:53.114
I've been such a fool.

33:53.614 --> 33:55.241
Hey, of course you haven't.

33:57.035 --> 33:59.412
Wanting to live life is never foolish.

33:59.495 --> 34:02.957
I just wanted to protect you
from heartbreak.

34:04.375 --> 34:06.502
I believe you, and thanks.

34:06.586 --> 34:09.338
But I can take care of myself, I promise.

34:10.006 --> 34:11.716
Next time, just tell me.

34:11.799 --> 34:15.928
We're friends. We don't need
to make things so complicated.

34:16.012 --> 34:17.221
One more thing.

34:18.890 --> 34:20.933
Find a better spot to hide your cameras.

34:26.939 --> 34:28.107
This way, guys.

34:29.275 --> 34:30.443
Hey.

34:30.943 --> 34:33.613
Hey, we'll walk quietly to the house.

34:33.696 --> 34:36.365
First song is "Sabor a Mí." Let's do it.

34:36.449 --> 34:38.451
Hang on. Who's that guy?

34:38.534 --> 34:39.660
What is he doing here?
