WEBVTT

00:10.301 --> 00:12.303
[theme music playing]

01:01.269 --> 01:02.979
[Paladins grunting]

01:13.782 --> 01:14.783
Whoa.

01:17.869 --> 01:19.370
[Hunk] Wait, where are we?

01:22.040 --> 01:23.374
[Alfor] On Daibazaal.

01:26.795 --> 01:28.338
It's pristine.

01:28.797 --> 01:31.508
Last we were here, all was decimated.

01:33.218 --> 01:37.055
The landscapes of her mind
must be made up of places from her past.

01:37.305 --> 01:38.264
Wait, hold up.

01:38.348 --> 01:40.809
If all this is a big, old Honerva
thought bubble,

01:40.892 --> 01:42.602
then wouldn't she know we're here?

01:43.228 --> 01:46.564
About 20 years ago, the Garrison
was able to map the human brain.

01:47.065 --> 01:48.983
They used a ventral metatronic reactor

01:49.067 --> 01:52.028
to read the thera-magnetic wave signatures
of each of the subjects.

01:52.112 --> 01:53.404
Get to the point, Pidge.

01:53.863 --> 01:59.119
A person's mind is an endless landscape
of constantly shifting thoughts and ideas.

01:59.452 --> 02:01.287
We must be hidden in the chaos.

02:01.913 --> 02:04.916
Do you know this for sure,
or is this just a theory?

02:04.999 --> 02:06.543
Well, it's a theory,

02:06.626 --> 02:08.753
but if Honerva finds out
we're in her mind,

02:08.837 --> 02:10.672
I have a feeling we'll know about it.

02:10.755 --> 02:14.050
-[Hunk] Good point.
-[Keith] Allura, where should we go next?

02:16.136 --> 02:18.638
[Allura] The entity wants us
to enter the palace.

02:33.069 --> 02:34.988
Allura, please listen to me.

02:35.572 --> 02:37.407
Alteans are life-givers.

02:37.824 --> 02:40.451
The entity you possess
is a dark, ancient evil.

02:40.535 --> 02:42.453
It is not the key to winning this war.

02:42.537 --> 02:44.747
I understand your concern,

02:44.831 --> 02:47.792
but the entity granted us access
to Honerva's mind.

02:48.251 --> 02:51.045
Without it,
your spirit would still be cursed.

02:51.462 --> 02:53.506
If you're looking for real power,

02:53.590 --> 02:56.843
the ability to become
a true Altean Alchemist,

02:56.926 --> 02:58.887
there is a place where you can train.

02:59.721 --> 03:01.389
Oriande. I know.

03:01.472 --> 03:04.642
I've been there
and passed the guardian's trials.

03:05.059 --> 03:06.853
That's wonderful news.

03:07.270 --> 03:09.814
You were able to gain
the power of Oriande.

03:10.106 --> 03:11.608
It isn't enough.

03:12.191 --> 03:14.903
That is why I must learn another method.

03:15.236 --> 03:18.156
The entity will guide us
toward the answers we seek.

03:19.282 --> 03:20.783
But at what cost?

03:23.286 --> 03:24.412
[crashing]

03:31.961 --> 03:33.212
[screaming]

03:36.341 --> 03:38.593
[snarls]

03:45.183 --> 03:46.184
[Lance] Whoa!

03:46.434 --> 03:49.687
-Where'd that thing come from?
-Guys, it's the monster from Arus!

03:49.854 --> 03:51.189
Form Voltron!

03:51.856 --> 03:53.358
[roars]

04:25.223 --> 04:26.057
[roars]

04:46.577 --> 04:48.162
Wait, where are the original Paladins?

04:55.503 --> 04:56.587
[all groan]

05:02.135 --> 05:03.428
What the heck was that?

05:03.511 --> 05:05.471
He couldn't do that
the last time we fought him!

05:05.555 --> 05:08.474
This is Honerva's mind!
Anything can happen.

05:08.558 --> 05:10.935
Wait, does this mean she knows we're here?

05:11.144 --> 05:14.272
[Allura] It appears she has guardians
to protect her thoughts and memories.

05:24.365 --> 05:26.868
[all shouting]

05:33.791 --> 05:37.462
The original Paladins,
they're still with us! [grunts]

05:38.004 --> 05:40.465
[all grunting]

05:50.183 --> 05:52.894
[Alfor] Voltron, keep going.
We'll hold off the beast.

06:01.194 --> 06:02.779
Thanks for the help, Paladins.

06:02.862 --> 06:05.782
-But where do we go?
-Any ideas, Allura?

06:09.994 --> 06:11.871
[wormhole whooshing]

06:14.165 --> 06:16.626
[Allura] Yes. I know what we must do.

06:21.672 --> 06:23.341
[zapping]

06:27.637 --> 06:30.681
[gasping]

06:32.100 --> 06:35.645
-[Keith] Is everyone okay?
-[Hunk] Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm good.

06:35.728 --> 06:37.355
[Pidge] Yeah, I'm all right.

06:37.438 --> 06:41.192
-[Allura panting] Just a bit shaken.
-[Lance] What the heck just happened?

06:41.943 --> 06:44.654
These are traps, just like that monster.

06:44.821 --> 06:47.615
They're fail-safes Honerva is using
to protect her secrets

06:47.698 --> 06:50.368
from any unwanted intruders-- us.

06:50.952 --> 06:51.828
What?

06:51.911 --> 06:54.497
I thought the entity
was supposed to be helping us.

06:54.831 --> 06:56.916
It's pulling us back to its source.

06:57.208 --> 06:59.877
Unfortunately, that source
is being protected.

07:00.211 --> 07:03.923
Great, so the thing that is guiding us
might get us killed.

07:04.674 --> 07:07.885
What we're looking for is in there.

07:24.235 --> 07:25.069
[girl laughs]

07:26.070 --> 07:27.572
[laughter echoing]

07:27.947 --> 07:29.532
-Honerva.
-[thunder booms]

07:33.661 --> 07:34.620
Father.

07:35.746 --> 07:37.248
These must be her memories.

07:57.852 --> 07:59.228
[screams]

08:05.568 --> 08:07.236
Where are the Lions?

08:07.570 --> 08:09.197
They've been destroyed.

08:09.780 --> 08:12.992
-[thunder booms]
-You dare lie to me?

08:13.701 --> 08:14.952
It's the truth.

08:15.453 --> 08:17.371
You'll never see your Lion again.

08:20.833 --> 08:22.627
Neither will you.

08:33.930 --> 08:34.764
She...

08:35.723 --> 08:37.099
She killed them.

08:38.226 --> 08:41.354
What she did to them was terrible.

08:42.730 --> 08:45.274
I always assumed
they sacrificed themselves,

08:45.358 --> 08:48.194
but I-- I didn't realize
what that entailed.

08:49.570 --> 08:52.573
That's how the original Paladins
ended up trapped here.

08:52.823 --> 08:54.575
She took their Quintessence,

08:54.909 --> 08:57.578
trapped their minds
inside her consciousness.

08:58.538 --> 08:59.789
It drove them mad.

09:01.082 --> 09:02.833
He was the leader of Voltron.

09:03.709 --> 09:06.295
And he just turned on them.

09:07.838 --> 09:11.050
-[thunder crashes]
-That is why we must destroy Honerva.

09:11.759 --> 09:13.135
[Lance] Allura, please.

09:13.761 --> 09:16.764
What we just saw,
it was all because of the entity.

09:17.306 --> 09:19.392
The same one that's inside you.

09:19.850 --> 09:21.310
You need to get rid of it.

09:21.602 --> 09:25.731
If Allura loses the entity,
then we lose our connection to Honerva.

09:46.252 --> 09:47.253
[Hunk] Aw...

09:48.045 --> 09:49.005
now where are we?

09:49.964 --> 09:50.923
Stand back.

09:59.724 --> 10:03.394
The deeper we get into her mind,
the more recent the memories.

10:04.395 --> 10:05.229
Good.

10:15.865 --> 10:17.867
[rumbling]

10:19.827 --> 10:20.786
[Honerva] Lotor.

10:22.913 --> 10:25.207
We'll all be together soon.

10:32.548 --> 10:35.468
Pidge, any idea what part of her brain
we're in now?

10:35.843 --> 10:37.678
No, I'm not sure.

10:37.762 --> 10:39.472
[Honerva] Wait... Voltron.

10:40.181 --> 10:41.515
-Voltron!
-[Paladins shout]

10:41.599 --> 10:43.976
My son... I will find you.

10:44.060 --> 10:46.395
This flame represents Lotor.

10:46.479 --> 10:47.813
Son, I will find you.

10:47.897 --> 10:50.274
The end for anyone who dares oppose me.

10:50.358 --> 10:51.901
Keith, grab my hand.

10:51.984 --> 10:54.654
[Honerva] Rise and avenge my son.

10:54.737 --> 10:57.239
-And my Altean...
-Hunk, over here!

10:58.240 --> 11:01.494
Everyone, feel the energy
of the entity within you.

11:02.286 --> 11:04.497
Don't fight it. Let it guide you.

11:04.580 --> 11:08.125
[Honerva] ...deeply coiled
in traditions of evil that tempt us.

11:08.209 --> 11:12.171
Voltron and Galra will pay
for what they did to my son.

11:15.132 --> 11:16.217
[groans]

11:16.759 --> 11:17.593
Huh?

11:18.677 --> 11:19.637
Oh, man.

11:19.970 --> 11:20.805
[groans]

11:21.389 --> 11:22.348
Oh, boy.

11:23.099 --> 11:24.266
Whoo, that was rough.

11:25.976 --> 11:26.811
Ah!

11:29.563 --> 11:30.648
[Allura] Altea!

11:32.149 --> 11:34.777
It looks different.

11:36.445 --> 11:39.740
This must be the way Honerva remembers it.

11:40.408 --> 11:42.368
It must be a place she holds dear.

11:43.077 --> 11:44.245
We should be close.

11:44.745 --> 11:48.833
[sighs] I wonder what kind of weird,
freaky thing is gonna attack us here.

11:49.959 --> 11:51.168
[all shout]

11:58.050 --> 12:00.469
Ah! Does that answer your question?

12:03.347 --> 12:05.558
Find safety! I'll distract it!

12:05.641 --> 12:06.934
What? No way!

12:07.017 --> 12:08.310
Just go!

12:11.397 --> 12:13.107
[Keith] You were their leader!

12:13.357 --> 12:16.444
They trusted you, and you betrayed them!

12:17.236 --> 12:19.405
You don't deserve the Black Lion!

12:29.039 --> 12:30.833
[roaring]

12:32.543 --> 12:35.254
[all roaring]

12:57.026 --> 12:59.403
[all shouting]

13:01.489 --> 13:03.908
Hunk, shoulder cannon!

13:04.450 --> 13:06.410
I can't! Ah!

13:25.721 --> 13:27.890
[all roaring]

13:58.087 --> 13:59.421
Form sword!

14:02.591 --> 14:05.177
[all shouting]

14:08.806 --> 14:10.224
[booming]

14:29.994 --> 14:32.204
Uh... guys?

14:47.386 --> 14:48.512
Zarkon?

15:11.869 --> 15:14.121
[Zarkon] Alfor. Blaytz.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.540
Gyrgan. Trigel.

15:20.377 --> 15:23.047
Melenor? What are you doing here?

15:23.964 --> 15:27.509
Melenor was my mother,
and you murdered her!

15:28.093 --> 15:29.678
You've killed millions!

15:30.512 --> 15:32.181
[Zarkon screaming]

15:32.765 --> 15:35.559
-[thunder booming]
-[Lance] Allura, what are you doing?

15:36.560 --> 15:39.313
Reminding him
of the suffering he's caused.

15:39.813 --> 15:41.774
[Zarkon grunting]

15:49.031 --> 15:51.784
[screaming]

15:57.331 --> 15:58.207
[booms]

16:08.926 --> 16:12.012
[screaming]

16:14.515 --> 16:15.516
[Zarkon] No.

16:17.643 --> 16:20.479
You did that. All of it!

16:21.063 --> 16:22.856
[Zarkon] I'm sorry, I...

16:23.482 --> 16:26.819
-I didn't realize what I--
-You knew exactly what you were doing.

16:27.361 --> 16:30.406
You deceived and betrayed
your friends and allies!

16:30.489 --> 16:31.782
[breathing heavily]

16:31.865 --> 16:33.158
The Quintessence...

16:34.076 --> 16:35.744
it blinded me.

16:36.537 --> 16:38.497
And you all suffered because of it.

16:38.789 --> 16:41.208
If you're truly sorry
for what you've done,

16:41.750 --> 16:43.460
then help us stop her.

16:44.044 --> 16:46.964
You must have been placed here
to protect something.

16:47.047 --> 16:47.881
What is it?

16:48.090 --> 16:50.259
I don't know. I...

16:51.176 --> 16:52.136
I'm sorry.

16:52.469 --> 16:54.054
What are you protecting?

16:54.847 --> 16:55.681
I don't...

16:59.643 --> 17:00.644
[Zarkon] That moon.

17:01.770 --> 17:03.647
It is a moon of Daibazaal.

17:05.441 --> 17:09.028
He's right, that moon is not of Altea.

17:09.862 --> 17:11.697
That is the source.

17:18.871 --> 17:20.831
-[roaring]
-[all grunt]

17:28.839 --> 17:30.299
[explosion]

17:58.494 --> 18:00.287
[baby crying]

18:06.293 --> 18:08.670
No. It's impossible.

18:08.754 --> 18:09.922
[young Lotor laughs]

18:10.839 --> 18:12.841
[Zarkon] They're her deepest desires.

18:13.759 --> 18:16.220
Everything she hopes to achieve.

18:17.096 --> 18:19.098
[laughing]

18:21.308 --> 18:23.727
How could she possibly achieve
any of this?

18:24.394 --> 18:27.397
Zarkon and Lotor are both gone.

18:28.565 --> 18:33.237
Unless she's going to use Lotor's ship
to pierce through realities

18:33.320 --> 18:36.240
and find the one
where she can live with her family.

18:36.490 --> 18:37.741
Is that even possible?

18:38.742 --> 18:42.579
Not without destroying
all other realities in the process.

18:49.253 --> 18:50.462
-[zaps]
-[all grunt]

18:50.546 --> 18:52.214
[wind howling]

18:55.134 --> 18:56.510
[Lance] What's going on?

18:56.760 --> 18:59.471
-[Zarkon] She knows you're here!
-How?

19:02.474 --> 19:04.434
[screaming]

19:04.518 --> 19:05.477
Allura!

19:05.811 --> 19:07.437
[Allura panting]

19:07.521 --> 19:08.647
-Allura?
-[whimpering]

19:09.022 --> 19:10.274
What's happening to her?

19:10.357 --> 19:12.734
[Zarkon] The princess holds
the entity within.

19:13.152 --> 19:14.903
Honerva controls it now.

19:19.158 --> 19:21.577
Everyone, get to your Lions!

19:27.916 --> 19:29.084
Where did they go?

19:29.668 --> 19:30.794
You're in her mind.

19:31.253 --> 19:33.172
She's more powerful here.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.802
[booming]

19:41.680 --> 19:42.764
What do we do?

19:43.265 --> 19:46.727
There's nothing you can do
but accept defeat.

19:47.603 --> 19:50.105
[Keith] No! We won't give up!

19:51.440 --> 19:53.025
That's your Galra lineage.

19:53.650 --> 19:56.278
It's what makes you
a great leader of Voltron.

19:56.820 --> 19:58.405
You and I share that trait.

19:59.823 --> 20:02.075
But look where it has led the two of us.

20:02.159 --> 20:04.328
My desire for unlimited Quintessence

20:04.411 --> 20:07.372
was the catalyst
for 10,000 years of destruction.

20:08.040 --> 20:11.835
Your quest to save the universe
took you into the mind of a psychopath.

20:12.586 --> 20:16.340
[Keith] Yes, to gain the knowledge
of what she's doing.

20:17.424 --> 20:18.467
And now we know.

20:19.468 --> 20:21.178
Yet you still don't know how!

20:21.845 --> 20:23.263
She's too powerful.

20:23.722 --> 20:27.726
Zarkon, Honerva may be more powerful
than each of us alone,

20:27.809 --> 20:30.354
but the strength of ten Paladins
working together as one

20:30.437 --> 20:32.606
is the strongest force in the universe.

20:32.981 --> 20:34.983
The Lions are gone, Alfor.

20:35.609 --> 20:37.986
Voltron is gone forever.

20:38.528 --> 20:41.198
No, Voltron isn't gone.

20:41.531 --> 20:44.201
Voltron is within
each and every one of us.

20:44.660 --> 20:47.329
We're bonded to it, and to each other.

20:47.788 --> 20:50.374
We have one last chance
to set things right,

20:50.457 --> 20:52.376
but we cannot do it without you.

20:52.751 --> 20:55.212
Ride with us one last time, Zarkon.

21:01.843 --> 21:03.845
[rumbling]

21:12.437 --> 21:14.523
Form Voltron!

21:51.810 --> 21:53.937
[Zarkon] Form Blazing Sword!

22:01.903 --> 22:04.323
[booster booming]

22:32.684 --> 22:34.478
[grunting]

22:35.729 --> 22:38.940
-We did it!
-Yes! Yes.

22:39.775 --> 22:41.068
[Keith] Nice work, team.

22:41.443 --> 22:43.153
Allura, are you okay?

22:43.862 --> 22:45.822
-[Hunk] Allura?
-[Lance] Allura?

22:46.782 --> 22:50.160
-[Pidge] Allura, are you okay?
-[Keith] Allura, do you copy?

22:51.369 --> 22:53.789
