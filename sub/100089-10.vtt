WEBVTT

00:02.176 --> 00:04.308
Oh, FYI,
the club is having

00:04.352 --> 00:06.484
a Twelve Days of Christmas-
themed dinner

00:06.528 --> 00:08.095
that'll knock
your socks off.
Ooh!

00:08.138 --> 00:10.749
Punishing amount of poultry.
Just brutal.

00:10.793 --> 00:12.316
Now, brutal
in a fun way

00:12.360 --> 00:14.318
or brutal in, like,
Rory's burn book way?

00:14.362 --> 00:17.321
That kid took us bothdown.I never wore sandals again.

00:17.365 --> 00:19.149
Hey, you ever think about
telling the kids about us?

00:19.193 --> 00:20.498
And say what?

00:20.542 --> 00:22.065
I mean, wehaven't
even labeled this.

00:22.109 --> 00:23.675
Whatever thisis.

00:23.719 --> 00:26.200
But if we werelabeling it,
what would it be?

00:26.243 --> 00:27.288
Snuggle buddies?

00:27.331 --> 00:29.072
Handsy carpoolers?

00:29.116 --> 00:30.247
Hot tub pals.

00:30.291 --> 00:32.249
Ooh! Or maybe --
maybe just "tubbers"?

00:32.293 --> 00:34.512
Oh, I love our workin the hot tub.

00:34.556 --> 00:38.777
But all this -- kids,having a conversation, words --

00:38.821 --> 00:40.649
feels likea 2020 problem to me.

00:40.692 --> 00:42.738
I'm so glad you said that,
'cause I just...

00:42.781 --> 00:45.306
you know, I like being
in our little bubble.

00:45.349 --> 00:46.524
So safe in here.
Yes!

00:46.568 --> 00:49.005
Just you and me,ignoring the needy screams

00:49.049 --> 00:51.442
of the children
we're hiding from.

00:51.486 --> 00:52.748
Uh-huh.

00:52.791 --> 00:55.011
Amy: Lights.Emma:
Watch the bulbs this time!

00:55.055 --> 00:57.231
Get off my ass,
will ya?!

01:01.583 --> 01:02.932
Look.

01:02.975 --> 01:05.152
I told you, I got it!

01:05.195 --> 01:06.240
No.

01:06.283 --> 01:07.676
Look.

01:10.200 --> 01:11.332
Aah!

01:12.855 --> 01:16.163
--Captions by VITAC--

01:18.208 --> 01:20.341
Gotta say, Angie,
I am very impressed

01:20.384 --> 01:22.386
with how you've uppedyour Christmas game this year.

01:22.430 --> 01:24.475
I see you hung
a Santa beard.

01:24.519 --> 01:26.216
You know, that's not normallya decoration,

01:26.260 --> 01:27.478
but still,I admire the effort.

01:27.522 --> 01:29.219
Oh!

01:29.263 --> 01:31.395
That's a beard.
I thought it was snow.

01:31.439 --> 01:32.527
Now that we're back
in the house,

01:32.570 --> 01:34.268
I just want to give Graham
the best Christmas ever.

01:34.311 --> 01:35.791
You know, it's been
a crazy couple months.

01:35.834 --> 01:38.359
Yeah, he lived in a sauna,like a human towel.

01:38.402 --> 01:39.925
And check it --

01:39.969 --> 01:41.797
this year, I'm gonna read
Graham's letter to Santa.

01:41.840 --> 01:43.146
You've never
read it before?

01:43.190 --> 01:45.235
And feel bad for all the crap
I can't afford to buy him?

01:45.279 --> 01:46.628
No, thank you.

01:46.671 --> 01:48.282
That blood's
on Santa's hands.

01:48.325 --> 01:49.805
This Christmas,
Graham is gonna get

01:49.848 --> 01:51.198
everything he asks for,
even if it means

01:51.241 --> 01:53.287
I have to max out
all my credit cards

01:53.330 --> 01:54.853
and sell my teeth and hair,
like in "Les Mis."

01:54.897 --> 01:56.333
You know,I actually played Cosette

01:56.377 --> 01:58.292
in a gender-bending production
of "Les Mis"

01:58.335 --> 02:00.729
at a junior collegewhere I was not enrolled.

02:00.772 --> 02:03.384
I...don't love
knowing that.

02:03.427 --> 02:06.300
Alright, kidoodle,time to hit the road.

02:06.343 --> 02:08.606
A-plus decking the halls,
Angie.

02:08.650 --> 02:10.347
You would never
be able to tell

02:10.391 --> 02:12.958
you burned down
your own house.

02:13.002 --> 02:15.265
And a merry Christmasto you, child.

02:16.614 --> 02:17.789
Graham: Here, Mom.

02:17.833 --> 02:20.183
For the mailbox
at the bottom of your purse.

02:20.227 --> 02:23.795
♪ We won't go
until we get some♪

02:23.839 --> 02:25.623
♪ We won't go
until we get some♪

02:30.280 --> 02:31.977
Graham: Hi, Santa.

02:32.021 --> 02:34.632
Based on what's been
under the tree lately,

02:34.676 --> 02:37.331
I suspect I may have
the wrong address.

02:37.374 --> 02:39.246
Have you switched Poles?

02:39.289 --> 02:41.465
Anywhoozle, this year,

02:41.509 --> 02:43.859
I only have two things
on my list.

02:43.902 --> 02:46.644
1, I want to see snow.

02:46.688 --> 02:49.038
2, I want to meet my dad.

02:51.519 --> 02:53.912
Oh, that's a punch in the butt.

02:56.393 --> 02:58.874
How long you plan on loitering
in front of my fireplace?

02:58.917 --> 03:00.658
Until I get
the perfect photo.

03:00.702 --> 03:03.705
You know how hard I work on myChristmas card/Instagram post

03:03.748 --> 03:05.272
'cause I don't knowwhere the stamp goes.

03:05.315 --> 03:07.491
Well, at least you know
that there arestamps,

03:07.535 --> 03:09.276
and that's more
than I'd expect.

03:09.319 --> 03:11.103
Hey, hey, Douglas,
I got a problem.

03:11.147 --> 03:12.931
Well, good luck with it.
And use coasters.

03:12.975 --> 03:14.498
No, no, no, no!
Listen, listen.

03:14.542 --> 03:16.457
So, I askedmy friend with bennies,

03:16.500 --> 03:17.849
Homily Pronstroller,

03:17.893 --> 03:19.634
to help me come upwith the dopest, freshest,

03:19.677 --> 03:22.158
most off-the-wall idea
for a card.

03:22.202 --> 03:23.507
I thought she wasthe coolest girl around,

03:23.551 --> 03:26.075
but she keeps pitching meall this lame stuff.

03:26.118 --> 03:27.903
Who's ready for photos?

03:27.946 --> 03:29.818
I got you
matching Christmas sweaters.

03:29.861 --> 03:32.037
Hey, you know,
when you get those printed, uh,

03:32.081 --> 03:33.387
I'll take two copies,
okay?

03:33.430 --> 03:34.649
Okay.
Right on that.

03:34.692 --> 03:36.390
Ugh. Yes.
Mm.

03:36.433 --> 03:38.130
I knew
you were a snowman guy.

03:38.174 --> 03:39.871
Jack, you're gonna look
so good in this!

03:39.915 --> 03:42.483
Miggy! Miggy!

03:42.526 --> 03:45.181
The twins came to me with
some...troubling information.

03:45.225 --> 03:46.400
We need
a third-party confirmation.

03:46.443 --> 03:47.531
Okay.

03:47.575 --> 03:48.402
Are my dad...

03:48.445 --> 03:49.751
And my darling mother...

03:49.794 --> 03:51.492
Boyfriend
and girlfriend?

03:51.535 --> 03:52.449
Oh, yeah.You guys didn't know?

03:52.493 --> 03:53.929
What?
Oh, my God.

03:53.972 --> 03:55.757
Girls, get the salts.

03:55.800 --> 03:57.628
I'm going down.

04:01.806 --> 04:03.330
Hey. Will.

04:03.373 --> 04:04.766
Remember when I said
that Graham was

04:04.809 --> 04:07.203
gonna get everything
on his list this year?

04:07.247 --> 04:08.944
That little dumb-dumb
asked for snow.

04:08.987 --> 04:10.554
Damn, girl, you dead.

04:10.598 --> 04:11.642
No. Not dead.

04:11.686 --> 04:14.341
I'm gonna drive north
until I hit the white stuff,

04:14.384 --> 04:17.866
maybe...I don't know,use that map thingy on my phone.

04:17.909 --> 04:19.781
Ew.
This cookie's trash.

04:21.043 --> 04:22.087
Your phone?

04:22.131 --> 04:23.350
Angie, you are standing

04:23.393 --> 04:25.439
in front of KZOP'spreeminent alternate weatherman.

04:26.614 --> 04:28.746
I'll find you snow.

04:28.790 --> 04:30.879
Isn't TV weather just
for entertainment purposes?

04:30.922 --> 04:32.446
Entertainment purposes?

04:32.489 --> 04:34.709
No.I am a professional.

04:34.752 --> 04:36.450
Let's see here.

04:36.493 --> 04:38.103
Ah ha ha ha!

04:38.147 --> 04:40.976
Looks like Lake Arrowhead
is expecting an onding.

04:41.019 --> 04:42.325
What's that, you ask?

04:42.369 --> 04:44.240
That's just
the 18th-century Scottish word

04:44.284 --> 04:45.372
for "heavy snowfall."

04:45.415 --> 04:47.330
Something that just came
from my mind.

04:47.374 --> 04:50.507
I'll go ahead
and book us a cabin.

04:50.551 --> 04:52.379
Really?

04:52.422 --> 04:54.163
Wow. Thanks, Will.

04:54.206 --> 04:55.251
You're the best.

04:55.295 --> 04:56.731
You owe me $200.Amazing.

04:56.774 --> 04:57.601
I'll Venmo you.

04:58.863 --> 05:00.778
Will you?Absolutely not.

05:05.783 --> 05:07.829
I mean, once you get pastthe insane height difference,

05:07.872 --> 05:09.352
this tracks.

05:09.396 --> 05:11.223
Mom's been acting
super-weird lately.

05:11.267 --> 05:14.444
Mom, Louisa's sleepover dresscode is "Titanic Steerage,"

05:14.488 --> 05:16.403
so, um...have you seenmy nightshirt?

05:16.446 --> 05:17.360
Mom?

05:17.404 --> 05:18.709
Mom?

05:18.753 --> 05:20.450
Poppy!
Oh, what? Yeah?

05:20.494 --> 05:22.626
She only busts out Cocoby Chanel on special occasions,

05:22.670 --> 05:25.281
and there has been a lotof special occasions lately.

05:25.325 --> 05:27.501
Our dad's been
sketchy as hell, too.

05:27.544 --> 05:29.503
Make it sing, Tony.

05:32.114 --> 05:33.637
Mm.

05:33.681 --> 05:36.423
Tony usually only does
the big shave on his birthday.

05:36.466 --> 05:38.816
He's been swinging that blade
every week.

05:38.860 --> 05:40.731
Right under our nosesthe entire time.

05:40.775 --> 05:42.167
Like Charles and Camilla.

05:42.211 --> 05:43.255
Hold up.

05:43.299 --> 05:44.605
But what does this mean?

05:44.648 --> 05:46.389
Are you going to be
our triplet?

05:46.433 --> 05:48.478
Listen,
Poppy's great.

05:48.522 --> 05:50.045
No disrespect.

05:50.088 --> 05:51.568
But the Fogertys
got a system.

05:51.612 --> 05:53.178
Yeah, it works.

05:53.222 --> 05:55.398
All this change
kind of makes me want to yarf.

05:55.442 --> 05:57.618
Okay.

05:57.661 --> 05:59.576
There is clearly
a lot of emotion here,

05:59.620 --> 06:01.448
but we can start working throughthat crap after Christmas.

06:01.491 --> 06:03.841
Right now,
we have the next 48 hours

06:03.885 --> 06:07.454
to use the info to get
as many presents as possible.

06:07.497 --> 06:09.499
Ooh, I love
an inside job.

06:09.543 --> 06:11.632
How are we gonna
get these suckers?

06:11.675 --> 06:14.069
When Mom was dating Mark Rush,
she felt super-weird about it

06:14.112 --> 06:16.419
and got me all of the celebrity
Barbies that I wanted --

06:16.463 --> 06:18.769
Ava DuVernay,
Tim McGraw and Faith Hill,

06:18.813 --> 06:20.031
Vitamin C --

06:20.075 --> 06:21.685
We gotta guilt them

06:21.729 --> 06:22.904
until the holiday
shipping window runs out.

06:22.947 --> 06:24.340
I want a baby hippo,

06:24.384 --> 06:25.863
and I'll just toss itwhen it gets too big.

06:25.907 --> 06:28.475
Who cares?
It's free.

06:28.518 --> 06:31.347
We're rich, you idiots.We're rich!

06:31.391 --> 06:32.609
Angie: Can you believe
I'm actually gonna pull off

06:32.653 --> 06:34.524
this snow-for-Christmas
thing?

06:34.568 --> 06:36.918
I'm such a good mom,
it's, like, obnoxious.

06:36.961 --> 06:38.615
We are 1,000 yards
away from snow.

06:38.659 --> 06:40.443
Yay!
Boy, oh, boy!

06:40.487 --> 06:42.271
Hey, how many times
do you think you could

06:42.314 --> 06:44.926
listen to this song on "repeat"
before you just ended it all?

06:44.969 --> 06:46.362
For me,
it would be four.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.495
Start practicing
your "brrr."

06:48.538 --> 06:50.061
Both: Brrr!

06:50.105 --> 06:52.542
♪ Deck the hallswith boughs of holly ♪

06:52.586 --> 06:54.152
All:
♪ Fa-la-la-la-la la-la-la

06:55.284 --> 06:56.416
I don't
see snow.

07:01.421 --> 07:03.510
Help me! Help me!My insides are drying!

07:03.553 --> 07:04.902
Here, here.

07:04.946 --> 07:06.513
So, I guess your prediction
was a little off.

07:06.556 --> 07:08.428
Oh. Wait.Is that a snowflake?

07:09.559 --> 07:10.821
Oh.

07:10.865 --> 07:12.301
No, it's just ash.

07:15.913 --> 07:17.611
Ugh!

07:17.654 --> 07:18.742
This is exactly
what I was talking about.

07:18.786 --> 07:20.831
Weathermen are
just like palm readers --

07:20.875 --> 07:23.617
fun, never right,
wear too much makeup.

07:23.660 --> 07:24.661
I am a scientist.

07:24.705 --> 07:26.489
I went to school
for meteorology.

07:26.533 --> 07:27.621
Oh, yeah?
And what were your classes?

07:27.664 --> 07:30.058
Looking Out the Window
101?

07:30.101 --> 07:32.626
Oh, and when did they teach you
to do this with your hands?

07:32.669 --> 07:34.410
Okay, now we are veeringinto hurtful territory.

07:34.454 --> 07:35.498
You said
you'd get me snow!

07:35.542 --> 07:37.500
Look, I knowthat Graham has had a hard year

07:37.544 --> 07:39.197
and you want to get himeverything on his list.

07:39.241 --> 07:40.764
Here.

07:40.808 --> 07:43.158
Read this!

07:44.594 --> 07:45.726
"I want to meet
my dad --"

07:45.769 --> 07:46.727
Oh.

07:46.770 --> 07:47.728
Ohhhh.

07:47.771 --> 07:48.946
Ohhh!

07:48.990 --> 07:50.861
Yeah, this is, uh...

07:50.905 --> 07:51.732
this is a toughie.

07:51.775 --> 07:53.429
Hmm. Yeah. Okay.

07:53.473 --> 07:54.778
Well, let me look around
for some "doy."

07:54.822 --> 07:56.650
Nope! No doy!

07:56.693 --> 07:57.912
Well, do you thinkthat he heard something

07:57.955 --> 07:59.174
about Derek showing up?

07:59.217 --> 08:01.089
No! I didn't
tell him anything.

08:01.132 --> 08:04.396
Graham knows zero percent
real things about his dad.

08:04.440 --> 08:06.137
When he was 4,
he started asking questions,

08:06.181 --> 08:07.530
and I panicked
and told him that his dad

08:07.574 --> 08:09.924
was a blueberry scientist
in Greece.

08:09.967 --> 08:11.795
'Cause you were eating blueberryGreek yogurt at the time?

08:11.839 --> 08:12.883
Obviously.

08:14.581 --> 08:18.759
Once I give Graham a dad,
he'll be in our lives forever.

08:18.802 --> 08:20.587
And if they meet...

08:20.630 --> 08:22.110
what if
it doesn't go well?

08:22.153 --> 08:23.677
Or what if it does?

08:23.720 --> 08:26.897
Or what if Graham hates Derek
or Derek hates Graham?

08:26.941 --> 08:29.683
Or what if they team up
and both decide they hate me?

08:29.726 --> 08:31.423
Just because thathappened at your bankand with your co-workers

08:31.467 --> 08:32.816
doesn't meanit'll happen with them.

08:32.860 --> 08:34.818
There are a million things
that could happen,

08:34.862 --> 08:36.341
and I-I can't control
any of them.

08:36.385 --> 08:39.170
And right now, I control
every part of Graham's life,

08:39.214 --> 08:42.739
right down to the fact thathis diet is 78% chicken fingers.

08:42.783 --> 08:45.046
Ang --
No!

08:45.089 --> 08:47.701
I am sensing some
real "open your heart"
vibes right now,

08:47.744 --> 08:48.832
and I don't want
to hear it.

08:48.876 --> 08:50.399
What are you doing?

You bought him a re-creationof the "Clueless" closet?

09:57.901 --> 09:59.642
What?I like that Paul Rudd.

09:59.686 --> 10:01.252
His skin doesn't age.

10:01.296 --> 10:03.864
It's not a re-creation, Douglas.
It is thecloset.

10:03.907 --> 10:05.648
Had it dug out
from a prop house

10:05.692 --> 10:07.824
and hired round-the-clock
coders in the Ukraine
to put Rory in it.

10:07.868 --> 10:08.782
See?

10:08.825 --> 10:10.218
Whoo!

10:12.873 --> 10:14.265
So cute.

10:14.309 --> 10:15.658
And so expensive.

10:15.702 --> 10:19.053
I've been going hard, too,with the presents for the girls.

10:19.096 --> 10:22.491
I made a down paymenton a fully operational crane.

10:22.534 --> 10:23.797
Yeah, the dealer hosed me,

10:23.840 --> 10:26.495
but at least it comeswith a 20-foot American flag.

10:26.538 --> 10:28.323
Oh! Emma and Amy
are gonna love that.

10:28.366 --> 10:30.325
Picking heavy stuff up,
putting heavy stuff down.

10:30.368 --> 10:31.543
Maybe I've gone soft,

10:31.587 --> 10:34.677
but I just can't resistthose big, blue peepers.

10:34.721 --> 10:37.854
Today, Emma says to me,"It's us against the world."

10:37.898 --> 10:39.247
Can you believe that?

10:39.290 --> 10:41.031
Wait a minute.

10:41.075 --> 10:43.338
Rory said the exact same thing
to metoday.

10:44.600 --> 10:45.514
Ohh.

10:45.557 --> 10:46.733
Ohh.

10:49.953 --> 10:51.868
Are we sure
this is the look?

10:51.912 --> 10:54.044
My parents would love
these pictures,

10:54.088 --> 10:56.090
and that's not
what I'm going for.

10:56.133 --> 10:57.395
Hey, maybe
we could mix it up.

10:57.439 --> 11:00.137
Miggy, do you knowanyone cooler than me?

11:00.181 --> 11:01.617
Where do I live?

11:01.661 --> 11:03.967
In an abandoned doll factory
downtown.

11:04.011 --> 11:05.708
Yeah.
I know what's hip.

11:05.752 --> 11:09.712
Now, uh, put your fistunder your chin like this.

11:09.756 --> 11:10.974
Oh, come on.
Just...

11:11.018 --> 11:12.584
Yeah. Yeah.

11:12.628 --> 11:13.324
Miggy.

11:13.368 --> 11:14.064
Miggy!

11:14.108 --> 11:15.196
Hey.

11:15.239 --> 11:16.545
Do the kids know
we're dating?

11:16.588 --> 11:17.589
Oh, yeah.You guys didn't know?

11:17.633 --> 11:19.504
Oh, my God.
Oh, my --

11:19.548 --> 11:21.419
Tony, enact the protocol.This is fine.

11:21.463 --> 11:22.986
Parents date.Enact the protocol!

11:23.030 --> 11:24.553
There's a red alert!

11:26.381 --> 11:29.079
I found a receipt
for a zero turn mower.

11:29.123 --> 11:31.212
The man's like
putty in our hands.

11:31.255 --> 11:34.519
I say we start thinkingeven bigger.

11:34.563 --> 11:35.651
Rory: Oh.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.131
We won't stop
until the three of us

11:37.174 --> 11:40.003
are sucking down Shirley T's
on the deck of a Disney Cruise.

11:43.790 --> 11:44.965
Mom.

11:45.008 --> 11:46.096
Ah. Look.

11:46.140 --> 11:47.881
It is
my beautiful mommy.

11:47.924 --> 11:49.186
I --

11:49.230 --> 11:50.318
I wuv you.

11:50.361 --> 11:51.667
Save it,
Rory Denzel Banks.

11:51.711 --> 11:53.016
We know what you kidshave been up to.

11:55.062 --> 11:56.019
After all we've done for you,

11:56.063 --> 11:57.455
and this is how you draw us?

11:59.806 --> 12:02.112
Why don't you children
take a seat?

12:06.813 --> 12:08.771
This place says they havefake snow on their website.

12:08.815 --> 12:10.599
Although,they did not advertise

12:10.642 --> 12:12.122
all the dirty underwear
in the parking lot.

12:12.166 --> 12:14.472
I mean, at this point, fake snowis better than no snow.

12:14.516 --> 12:16.039
And Graham was born
in Las Vegas.

12:16.083 --> 12:17.649
He was? Why?

12:17.693 --> 12:19.390
I was fat and bored
and didn't want to be

12:19.434 --> 12:21.175
the only person
throwing up on a sidewalk.

12:21.218 --> 12:23.220
Either way,
he won't know the difference.

12:23.264 --> 12:25.222
Hello.
Good holidays to you.

12:25.266 --> 12:27.268
We're visiting
from Los Angeles,

12:27.311 --> 12:28.835
and we're looking
for snow.

12:28.878 --> 12:30.706
Then why'd youcome to Arrowhead?It's hot as balls here.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.926
Because he is
a weatherman.

12:32.969 --> 12:35.624
A weatherman?That's a great scam, man!

12:35.667 --> 12:37.800
Huh. Wish I'd thought
of that one.

12:37.844 --> 12:39.454
Scam?

12:39.497 --> 12:41.021
Because of me, you know when
to put on a raincoat, bitch.

12:41.064 --> 12:42.457
Okay,
let's get down to it.

12:42.500 --> 12:44.198
Are you running
the snow machine today?

12:44.241 --> 12:45.590
Nope.Well,
what if we told you

12:45.634 --> 12:47.941
it'd make a young boy
very, very happy?

12:47.984 --> 12:50.030
He's not terminally ill,
but he canbe, if it helps.

12:50.073 --> 12:51.727
Mm.
No, doesn't help.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.294
It's so hot out,it's just gonna melt anyway.

12:53.337 --> 12:54.599
It's not worth my goo.

12:55.644 --> 12:57.211
Alright,
hey, hey, Angie.

12:57.254 --> 12:59.909
Do you think
maybe it might be time

12:59.953 --> 13:02.390
to consider giving Graham
the otherthing on his list?

13:02.433 --> 13:05.045
Oh, so we're just
handing out daddies
at Christmas now?

13:05.088 --> 13:06.742
And besides,
you hateDerek.

13:06.786 --> 13:07.917
I know.

13:07.961 --> 13:09.745
But you know who else
drives me nuts? Mia.

13:09.789 --> 13:11.747
But I'm still glad that
Sophie has a relationship
with her mother,

13:11.791 --> 13:13.880
because it adds
extra love to her life,

13:13.923 --> 13:15.838
and shouldn't Graham
have that, too?

13:15.882 --> 13:17.884
A dogcould be extra love.

13:17.927 --> 13:20.103
Or maybe a really heavy
weighted blanket.

13:20.147 --> 13:24.499
Angie, you can get Graham
snow or toys or vacations

13:24.542 --> 13:26.936
or a really high-quality
sweater shaver,

13:26.980 --> 13:28.720
which is what's on mylist
this year.

13:28.764 --> 13:31.549
But eventually, he is
gonna want to meet his dad,

13:31.593 --> 13:35.336
and if you want to control
when and where...

13:35.379 --> 13:37.425
now might not be
a bad time.

13:39.993 --> 13:41.124
Okay.

13:41.168 --> 13:42.256
Yeah.

13:42.299 --> 13:44.084
Message received.

13:44.127 --> 13:46.913
I just...need a minuteto marinate on it, okay?

13:46.956 --> 13:47.696
Of course.

13:49.132 --> 13:50.307
Hey, uh,
you like purple?

13:50.351 --> 13:52.309
'Cause, uh, if I don'tmove these trees,

13:52.353 --> 13:54.442
I'm gonna have toget back into gift card fraud.

13:54.485 --> 13:57.575
Unfortunately, I'm more ofa traditional greens guy myself.

13:57.619 --> 14:00.883
You know, I would loveto get into the weather racket.

14:00.927 --> 14:02.493
I mean,talk about easy cash.

14:02.537 --> 14:03.930
H-H-How do you
get into that game?

14:03.973 --> 14:06.019
I refuse to get in my secondfistfight ever during Christmas.

14:06.062 --> 14:08.456
Everybody! Get in!

14:08.499 --> 14:10.110
Wait!That's my snow machine!

14:10.153 --> 14:11.676
Mom's gone crazy!

14:11.720 --> 14:13.548
Does this count
as kidnapping?

14:13.591 --> 14:14.375
Angie, what the hell
are you doing?!

14:14.418 --> 14:15.332
Just get in!

14:15.376 --> 14:16.943
Diversion!

14:22.949 --> 14:24.385
Merry freakin' Christmas!

14:27.779 --> 14:28.911
Snow!

14:28.955 --> 14:30.173
Snow!

14:30.217 --> 14:31.696
Snow, damn it!

14:31.740 --> 14:34.047
Argh!

14:34.090 --> 14:35.178
Hey! Will, come on.

14:35.222 --> 14:37.093
Kick it.
Kick it for Graham.

14:37.137 --> 14:38.921
I'm not gonna kick it,
Angie.

14:38.965 --> 14:40.314
We are fugitives.

14:40.357 --> 14:42.751
Before today, my car has
only been used for good.

14:42.794 --> 14:43.926
You sullied the Honda.

14:43.970 --> 14:44.971
This is yourfault.

14:45.014 --> 14:46.711
You brought us here,

14:46.755 --> 14:48.409
and if this thing doesn't startpooping out snow soon,

14:48.452 --> 14:50.411
I'm not gonna pay you backfor the cabin.

14:50.454 --> 14:52.195
You already told me
you weren't.

14:52.239 --> 14:54.023
I'm gonna go wash down
this petty theft

14:54.067 --> 14:55.372
with some hot cocoa!

14:55.416 --> 14:57.070
Just because we're criminals
doesn't mean we can't be comfy.

14:57.113 --> 14:58.941
I'll take one.Do you want
marshmallows?

14:58.985 --> 15:00.334
Yes, please.
I'll be back!

15:01.683 --> 15:03.598
Mom?

15:03.641 --> 15:05.774
May I talk to you
for a second?

15:05.817 --> 15:08.516
Or are you too busy kicking
your stolen snow machine?

15:08.559 --> 15:09.952
Wha-- Stolen?

15:09.996 --> 15:11.606
This? Wha?

15:11.649 --> 15:14.565
You think I don't know
our house is full of hot goods?

15:14.609 --> 15:17.960
And it's clear
you read my letter to Santa.

15:19.570 --> 15:20.832
Busted.

15:23.400 --> 15:27.056
I-I just wanted to give youthe best Christmas ever, buddy.

15:27.100 --> 15:28.623
I get it.

15:28.666 --> 15:32.540
I mean...it's not like
we can rely on Santa.

15:32.583 --> 15:35.325
I ask him if I can meet my dad
every year,

15:35.369 --> 15:37.066
but it never happens.

15:38.024 --> 15:39.025
You do?

15:39.068 --> 15:40.809
You ask him every year?

15:40.852 --> 15:42.376
Yeah.

15:42.419 --> 15:44.682
Even Santa can't make my dad
want to meet me.

15:44.726 --> 15:46.249
No.

15:46.293 --> 15:48.208
Graham.

15:48.251 --> 15:51.385
I-I knowit may not seem like it,

15:51.428 --> 15:53.909
but your dad actually --

15:57.086 --> 15:58.044
Shedid it!

15:59.871 --> 16:02.135
How dare you three
manipulate us for presents!

16:02.178 --> 16:03.484
How dare us?

16:03.527 --> 16:06.139
How dare you!

16:06.182 --> 16:08.793
You've never kept a secretfrom us before, Dad.

16:08.837 --> 16:10.230
Oh,
that's what youthink.

16:10.273 --> 16:12.014
My dream is
that in your old age,

16:12.058 --> 16:13.798
you'll look at each other
and say,

16:13.842 --> 16:16.236
"In the end,
I knew nothing about that man."

16:16.279 --> 16:19.804
Well, we know you twowere kissing in our driveway.

16:19.848 --> 16:21.893
Okay, look, we don't have to
define our relationship

16:21.937 --> 16:23.417
for you guys, okay?

16:23.460 --> 16:25.158
We haven't even...
defined it for each other.

16:25.201 --> 16:26.376
That's right.

16:26.420 --> 16:28.900
We live in a bubble,
and it's very nice.

16:28.944 --> 16:30.250
A bubble?

16:30.293 --> 16:32.078
What kind of cop-out
is that?

16:33.775 --> 16:37.300
My mom deserves more
than some shadow relationship.

16:37.344 --> 16:38.432
Do you two love each other
or not?

16:44.351 --> 16:45.874
Hello?

16:45.917 --> 16:47.223
Okay. Yes.

16:47.267 --> 16:48.659
A shiv?

16:48.703 --> 16:49.660
Okay.

16:49.704 --> 16:51.662
W-- We'll be right there.

16:51.706 --> 16:53.621
Well, that's a callI always knew I would get.

16:53.664 --> 16:57.146
It's time to bailCooper and D'Amato out of jail.

16:57.190 --> 16:59.888
Move it!
Let's hustle.

16:59.931 --> 17:02.238
Okay, now let's get one
in front of my little buddies.

17:02.282 --> 17:04.719
No! I draw the line
at little buddies.

17:04.762 --> 17:06.242
Homily, this isn't me.

17:06.286 --> 17:07.896
I know you're the coolest chickon the planet,

17:07.939 --> 17:10.725
but your Christmas card ideasare corny as hell.

17:10.768 --> 17:11.943
Wow.

17:11.987 --> 17:13.641
Wow, Miggy.

17:13.684 --> 17:15.730
You know,
I have to say...

17:15.773 --> 17:17.253
it is really sexy

17:17.297 --> 17:19.168
that you stood up for yourself
just now.

17:19.212 --> 17:20.169
You're not mad?

17:20.213 --> 17:21.344
No, of course not.

17:21.388 --> 17:22.693
Art is subjective.

17:22.737 --> 17:24.260
That --
That is the whole point.

17:24.304 --> 17:26.132
Your pictures ain't art,
girl.

17:26.175 --> 17:27.698
Hey, where are
you guys going?

17:27.742 --> 17:29.178
Cooper and D'Amato
got locked up.

17:29.222 --> 17:30.310
Oh,
I am not missing this.

17:30.353 --> 17:31.267
Come on, come on.

17:33.617 --> 17:35.315
Oh, is it cool
if we bounce?
Yes. Have fun.

17:35.358 --> 17:37.273
I'll see you at my
Non-Denominational
Winter Cookie Party.

17:37.317 --> 17:38.057
Dope.

17:41.277 --> 17:42.887
Come on, little buddies.

17:42.931 --> 17:44.498
Let's take one with Mommy!

17:44.541 --> 17:47.370
Pronstroller. Get the hell
out of my house.

17:49.372 --> 17:51.157
I can't believe
to get the charges dropped,

17:51.200 --> 17:53.246
I had to buy two dozen
purple Christmas trees.

17:53.289 --> 17:54.595
I lovethem.

17:54.638 --> 17:56.510
They're the Rory
of trees.

17:56.553 --> 17:59.730
I gotta say,
mountain jail was kind of fun.

17:59.774 --> 18:03.169
I helped someone make a knife
out of a plastic fork.

18:03.212 --> 18:04.257
Terrific.

18:04.300 --> 18:05.388
Graham?

18:05.432 --> 18:06.520
Hey.

18:06.563 --> 18:08.261
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

18:08.304 --> 18:10.915
If it's about what I sawin the pokey,

18:10.959 --> 18:12.265
I'm processing it
pretty well.

18:12.308 --> 18:13.831
Even that pregnant lady.

18:13.875 --> 18:15.050
Oh. No.

18:15.094 --> 18:16.095
Uh...

18:18.401 --> 18:21.230
I just wanted
to let you know that...

18:21.274 --> 18:23.754
unlike
snow in California...

18:25.452 --> 18:28.150
...meeting your dad
isn't impossible.

18:29.760 --> 18:31.327
Yeah, right.

18:31.371 --> 18:33.155
No, Graham.

18:33.199 --> 18:35.940
It's not true that your dad
doesn't want to meet you.

18:35.984 --> 18:38.291
I've been in contact
with him lately,

18:38.334 --> 18:40.293
and it's actually
the opposite.

18:40.336 --> 18:41.642
Really?

18:41.685 --> 18:44.079
Yeah.

18:44.123 --> 18:46.255
So, when we get back,

18:46.299 --> 18:48.344
let's make a plan
for you two to meet.

18:50.477 --> 18:52.131
Thank you, Mom.

18:54.220 --> 18:55.612
Oh, man.

18:55.656 --> 18:57.223
I gotta practice
my Greek.

19:01.270 --> 19:02.967
Hey.

19:03.011 --> 19:04.186
Nice work.

19:04.230 --> 19:06.406
Welcome to
the terrifying world

19:06.449 --> 19:08.408
of not being the only adult
in your child's life.

19:08.451 --> 19:10.018
Thank you.

19:10.061 --> 19:11.889
Although, you'rean adult
in his life.

19:11.933 --> 19:14.675
And that's...been pretty great, actually.

19:15.850 --> 19:17.156
For both of us.

19:18.418 --> 19:20.028
Ditto.

19:20.071 --> 19:21.899
Oh, my God!
Snow!

19:24.293 --> 19:27.427
Oh, my God!
It's magical.

19:27.470 --> 19:28.428
Hello, old friend.

19:28.471 --> 19:30.125
Oh, that'ssnow.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.257
Let's get out there!

19:31.300 --> 19:32.214
Kids: Yeah!

19:35.522 --> 19:39.134
-You're gonna eat my snow!
-No, you're gonna
eat mysnow now!

19:39.178 --> 19:41.136
Oh, these L.A. kids
don't know snow.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.616
Every year in Buffalo,

19:42.659 --> 19:44.444
we'd lose at leastthree children in a drift.

19:44.487 --> 19:46.620
Now, thatwas snow.

19:46.663 --> 19:48.622
God, I love hearing
about your childhood.

19:51.494 --> 19:54.367
Hey, I hope the kids
didn't put you in your head.

19:54.410 --> 19:56.673
You know, how and when we chooseto define this relationship

19:56.717 --> 19:58.022
is completely up to us.

19:58.066 --> 19:59.633
We can stay
in the bubble --I love you.

20:04.986 --> 20:06.422
I love you, Poppy.

20:07.554 --> 20:11.166
And, uh...I think the kids are right.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.516
Because when you feel this way
about someone,

20:13.560 --> 20:15.649
you want the whole worldto be your bubble.

20:17.433 --> 20:20.480
I...

20:20.523 --> 20:22.133
I love you, too.

20:22.177 --> 20:23.178
Yeah?

20:23.222 --> 20:24.310
Yeah.

20:25.572 --> 20:26.529
Come here.

20:26.573 --> 20:28.488
Mm!

20:31.142 --> 20:33.710
Okay, so, is nobody
gonna thank me for this?

20:33.754 --> 20:36.539
Alright, well, how about
a quick 10-day forecast, then?

20:36.583 --> 20:38.280
Y'all are gonna be
kissing my butt on Monday,

20:38.324 --> 20:40.413
y'all are gonna be
kissing my butt on Tuesday,

20:40.456 --> 20:41.718
and you're gonna be
kissing my butt

20:41.762 --> 20:45.156
all the way through the weekend,because there's snow!

20:45.200 --> 20:48.334
Being a weatherman is the
closest thing to being a god.

21:00.346 --> 21:02.478
Hey, hey, everybody!
Circle up! Circle up!

21:06.003 --> 21:07.570
Thank you.

21:17.972 --> 21:19.452
Oh, yeah.

21:19.495 --> 21:20.670
That's the one.

21:20.714 --> 21:22.150
That's me.
