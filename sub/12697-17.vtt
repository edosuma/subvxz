00:02.102 --> 00:03.169
Hey, Carly. Hey, Sam.

00:03.235 --> 00:04.904
Watch me take off my glasses.

00:10.543 --> 00:11.845
Cool.

00:11.911 --> 00:13.380
I give "glasses with feet girl"
an eight.

00:13.446 --> 00:15.515
-I give her a nine.
-Seven.

00:15.582 --> 00:17.317
But I give Freddie
a negative 2.

00:17.384 --> 00:19.085
-For what?
-Just for being you.

00:20.120 --> 00:23.223
{\an8}You know, they say when a girl
constantly rips on a guy,

00:23.289 --> 00:26.025
{\an8}it really just means
she has a crush on him.

00:26.092 --> 00:28.161
{\an8}Yeah, but I wasn't rippin'
on a guy.

00:28.228 --> 00:30.296
{\an8}I was rippin' on you.

00:30.363 --> 00:31.664
{\an8}Oh, yeah?

00:31.731 --> 00:33.466
{\an8}-That's right.
-Hey, quit it, you two.

00:33.533 --> 00:34.768
{\an8}We gotta get through this
and pick videos

00:34.834 --> 00:36.002
{\an8}for our next webcast.

00:36.069 --> 00:37.470
{\an8}Okay.

00:37.537 --> 00:39.372
{\an8}Here's one from a kid named,
Andy, who has a turtle.

00:39.439 --> 00:41.374
{\an8}Playin'.

00:41.441 --> 00:43.510
{\an8}Hi, iCarly.
This is my pet turtle.

00:43.576 --> 00:45.645
{\an8}His name is Doctor Nub.

00:45.712 --> 00:47.013
{\an8}Doctor Nub?

00:47.080 --> 00:50.116
{\an8}No way that turtle
went to med school.

00:50.183 --> 00:51.785
Roll over, Doctor Nub.

00:51.851 --> 00:53.620
Come on, boy, roll over.

00:56.589 --> 00:57.590
Ta-da.

00:57.657 --> 00:58.658
-Zero.
-Lame.

00:58.725 --> 01:00.627
Negative nine.

01:00.693 --> 01:02.529
-Next.
-Okay.

01:02.595 --> 01:05.565
Here's one from two guys
both named Chris.

01:05.632 --> 01:07.167
What-up, Carly and Sam?

01:07.233 --> 01:08.435
What is up, yo?

01:08.501 --> 01:10.003
-I'm Chris.
-And I'm also Chris.

01:10.069 --> 01:12.705
-And we're best buds.
-BFBs.

01:12.772 --> 01:13.907
I like Chris,

01:13.973 --> 01:16.176
but Chris
kind of creeps me out.

01:16.242 --> 01:17.777
Not only are we best buds.

01:17.844 --> 01:22.015
We're also the world's
greatest meat drummers.

01:22.081 --> 01:23.583
Meat drummers?

01:30.156 --> 01:32.225
-Okay, this is great.
-Ten.

01:32.292 --> 01:33.593
-Ten.
-Ten.

01:33.660 --> 01:35.195
And the best friend
meat drummers

01:35.261 --> 01:36.463
get to be on iCarly.

01:36.529 --> 01:38.598
Yeah, meat drummers!

01:39.699 --> 01:41.201
Hey, speaking of best friends,

01:41.267 --> 01:42.602
you know what today is?

01:42.669 --> 01:43.870
-The 25th?
-Yup.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.839
-No way.
-What's the 25th?

01:45.905 --> 01:48.107
The five-year anniversary
of when Sam and I first met.

01:48.174 --> 01:49.476
Yup.

01:49.542 --> 01:52.278
I remember it like
it was only five years ago.

01:54.380 --> 01:55.582
Hey, I'm Sam.

01:55.648 --> 01:57.116
Hi, I'm Carly.

01:57.183 --> 01:58.384
Can I have that sandwich?

01:58.451 --> 02:00.220
No way, get your own.

02:01.955 --> 02:03.189
Ow!

02:12.665 --> 02:14.200
You're all right.

02:17.003 --> 02:17.737
Wow.

02:17.804 --> 02:19.072
So, even back then,

02:19.138 --> 02:21.007
you were obnoxious
and aggressive.

02:22.942 --> 02:24.844
Yeah.

02:24.911 --> 02:27.013
Can you believe we became
friends over a tuna sandwich?

02:27.080 --> 02:29.449
-And now, you hate tuna.
-No.

02:29.516 --> 02:30.683
I hate the way
that British chick

02:30.750 --> 02:31.851
in our history class says
"tuna."

02:31.918 --> 02:34.954
Oh, yeah. Tyooon-uh. Tyooon-uh.

02:36.022 --> 02:39.225
Oh, I just adore tyoooon-uh.

02:39.292 --> 02:40.560
Tyooon-uh.

02:40.627 --> 02:42.128
Yeah, don't play along,
all right?

02:44.297 --> 02:46.299
Anyway, since it's
our friendship anniversary,

02:46.366 --> 02:47.734
I got you a little somethin'.

02:47.800 --> 02:49.903
Wait, you got me a present?

02:49.969 --> 02:51.604
Ta-da.

02:51.671 --> 02:53.239
Oh, you shouldn't have gotten--
gimme it.

02:58.111 --> 03:00.179
Whoa, you got me
an iCarly T-shirt.

03:00.246 --> 03:02.181
Look on the back.

03:02.248 --> 03:03.383
Oh, it's our heads.

03:03.449 --> 03:04.817
In shirt form.

03:04.884 --> 03:07.487
-This is so insane.
-Oh, it's no big deal.

03:07.554 --> 03:09.322
Oh, please.
I love this.

03:09.389 --> 03:10.456
How great are you?

03:10.523 --> 03:11.891
I don't know. Very?

03:14.961 --> 03:15.995
Hey, you know
what I'm gonna get you?

03:16.062 --> 03:17.597
Oh, you don't have to get me--

03:17.664 --> 03:19.732
Tickets to the Cuddlefish
concert for next Friday night.

03:19.799 --> 03:21.401
-You and me, kid.
-Well, that'd be awesome.

03:21.467 --> 03:23.436
But that concert's
been sold out for months.

03:23.503 --> 03:25.004
You let me worry about that.

03:25.071 --> 03:26.940
I got ways, Carly Shay.

03:27.006 --> 03:27.974
And you know what else I got?

03:28.041 --> 03:29.742
Pimples on your butt?

03:36.382 --> 03:37.417

04:56.996 --> 04:58.631
Then I won't be needing this.

05:06.239 --> 05:08.174
I like this song.

05:08.241 --> 05:09.876
Pretty romantic, huh?

05:09.942 --> 05:11.577
You feelin' the mood?

05:11.644 --> 05:15.415
[toilet flushes]

05:15.481 --> 05:18.117
Yeah, I'm feeling the mood.

05:22.455 --> 05:25.024
I'm sad.

05:25.091 --> 05:25.825
Why?

05:25.892 --> 05:27.427
I was just at a funeral.

05:27.493 --> 05:29.629
-In the bathroom?
-Yeah.

05:29.696 --> 05:31.631
It's for my fish, Reggie.

05:31.698 --> 05:33.866
I loved that little guy.

05:33.933 --> 05:35.601
Even as I dropped
his lifeless carcass

05:35.668 --> 05:37.970
into the toilet.

05:38.037 --> 05:39.739
You forgot to feed him again,
didn't you?

05:39.806 --> 05:44.077
I'm not good with pets
that eat on a regular basis.

05:44.143 --> 05:46.212
You're lucky you know
how to use the microwave.

05:46.279 --> 05:49.415
I know, or else I'd be waving
goodbye from Spencer's toilet.

05:49.482 --> 05:50.550
All right. You just wait.

05:50.616 --> 05:52.051
I'm gonna prove to you

05:52.118 --> 05:53.686
that I can be a good,
responsible fish owner.

05:53.753 --> 05:55.555
No, you're not
getting another fish.

05:55.621 --> 05:56.889
All right.

05:56.956 --> 05:58.224
Starting right now.

05:58.291 --> 06:00.326
-I will not get another fish.
-Move.

06:00.393 --> 06:01.360
-Why?
-Move.

06:01.427 --> 06:02.662
I don't see--okay.

06:04.664 --> 06:06.365
You already bought
another fish.

06:07.734 --> 06:09.068
His name is Swimmy.

06:13.606 --> 06:16.809
[sneezes]

06:16.876 --> 06:18.377
Could you step back a few feet?

06:20.646 --> 06:22.348
I get asked that a lot.

06:26.586 --> 06:28.321
Hey, Rodney, can you hook me up
with somethin'?

06:28.387 --> 06:30.189
Sure, but I'm with a customer
right now,

06:30.256 --> 06:31.657
so you gotta wait.

06:32.558 --> 06:34.193
-Hurry.
-Ah.

06:36.195 --> 06:37.263
How about these?

06:37.330 --> 06:40.066
Whoa, Laotian tissues.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.002
They're made
from real peacock feathers.

06:43.069 --> 06:44.971
[sneezes]

06:45.037 --> 06:46.239
Peacocks.

06:47.507 --> 06:48.808
-Twenty bucks.
-Twenty?

06:48.875 --> 06:50.376
You care about your nose
or not?

06:51.677 --> 06:53.813
You swear they're Laotian?

06:53.880 --> 06:55.281
Guaranteed.

06:55.348 --> 06:56.649
I'll take 'em.

07:01.788 --> 07:03.923
Look at my foreign tissues.

07:03.990 --> 07:05.558
Yes, your snot is very lucky.

07:05.625 --> 07:06.859
Bye.

07:08.361 --> 07:09.729
So soft.

07:11.464 --> 07:13.366
Nice shirt. iCarly.

07:13.432 --> 07:14.834
-Awesome web show.
-Thanks.

07:14.901 --> 07:16.002
You guys sell those shirts?

07:16.068 --> 07:18.004
Nah, this is one of a kind.

07:18.070 --> 07:22.341
Listen, I need concert tickets.

07:22.408 --> 07:23.943
You came to the right place.

07:24.010 --> 07:28.848
I got Flaming Teeth,
Backflesh, Yellow Day.

07:28.915 --> 07:30.883
Cuddlefish. This Friday.

07:31.851 --> 07:32.952
That's a tough get.

07:33.019 --> 07:34.787
-How much?
-Hundred bucks.

07:34.854 --> 07:36.889
-A hundred?
-Each.

07:36.956 --> 07:39.659
Well, I see why they call you
Rip-Off Rodney.

07:39.725 --> 07:41.928
It's hurtful, yet appropriate.

07:43.596 --> 07:45.398
Whatever. Forget it.
I don't have 200 bucks.

07:45.464 --> 07:46.766
Wait.

07:47.667 --> 07:49.569
You up for a trade?

07:49.635 --> 07:50.603
What do you want?

07:50.670 --> 07:52.171
-That shirt.
-Why?

07:52.238 --> 07:54.407
'Cause iCarly's a hot web show.

07:54.473 --> 07:55.675
The more popular it gets,

07:55.741 --> 07:57.376
the more the shirt
will be worth.

07:58.544 --> 07:59.779
Trade?

08:06.819 --> 08:08.354
Spencer, have you seen Sam?

08:08.421 --> 08:10.056
We got eight minutes
'til show time.

08:10.122 --> 08:12.592
-I haven't seen her.
-Where is she?

08:12.658 --> 08:14.560
Ow, dang it.

08:14.627 --> 08:15.995
What are you doing?

08:16.062 --> 08:17.363
Well, since I keep forgetting
to feed my fish,

08:17.430 --> 08:19.232
I decided to use
my sculpting skills

08:19.298 --> 08:20.867
to build
an automatic fish feeder.

08:20.933 --> 08:22.635
Maybe now Swimmy
won't go hungry.

08:22.702 --> 08:23.803
Oh, no.

08:23.870 --> 08:25.471
Sadly Swimmy went very hungry.

08:25.538 --> 08:26.739
This is Brock.

08:27.707 --> 08:29.508
You only had Swimmy
for two days.

08:29.575 --> 08:31.043
His last two days, actually.

08:31.110 --> 08:32.778
But that's why I'm building
the fish feeder

08:32.845 --> 08:35.081
to avoid another fish-uneral.

08:37.015 --> 08:38.417
I'm here, I'm here.
Don't freak.

08:38.484 --> 08:40.219
Do you realize
the show starts in--

08:40.285 --> 08:41.520
Four minutes.

08:41.587 --> 08:43.389
I better go polish my lens.

08:44.957 --> 08:46.692
Where were you?
Why didn't you call?

08:46.759 --> 08:48.861
Why are you wearing that shirt?

08:48.928 --> 08:50.296
I am wearing
this hideous shirt

08:50.363 --> 08:52.498
because I got these.

08:52.565 --> 08:54.000
-Oh, my God.
-Yeah?

08:54.066 --> 08:56.302
-Cuddlefish tickets.
-Yeah, baby, let it out.

08:56.369 --> 08:58.170
[screams]

08:58.237 --> 09:00.039
Where'd you get these?
They're totally sold out.

09:00.106 --> 09:01.440
That guy Rodney from school,

09:01.507 --> 09:03.075
the dude who gets arrested
all the time.

09:03.142 --> 09:04.710
Oh, my God, he must have
charged you a fortune.

09:04.777 --> 09:06.279
Zero.

09:06.345 --> 09:08.814
I traded him the shirt
you gave me for the tickets.

09:08.881 --> 09:09.982
You traded the shirt?

09:10.049 --> 09:12.285
Yeah. Knuckle-touch.

09:16.355 --> 09:18.057
I'm not touching your knuckles.

09:18.124 --> 09:20.226
Why? They're clean.
I washed them yesterday, see?

09:22.595 --> 09:24.030
How could you trade the shirt

09:24.096 --> 09:26.065
that I made for you
to some sleazy kid?

09:26.132 --> 09:28.234
Two minutes, guys.

09:28.301 --> 09:29.235
Wait.

09:29.302 --> 09:31.003
I didn't just give it away.

09:31.070 --> 09:32.939
I traded the shirt
for something you really wanted

09:33.005 --> 09:34.140
and something
we can do together.

09:34.206 --> 09:35.875
But that shirt was special.

09:35.942 --> 09:38.210
It was the very first
iCarly T-shirt ever.

09:38.277 --> 09:40.012
You know, I spent, like,
two weeks making it for you?

09:40.079 --> 09:41.347
You said it was no big deal.

09:41.414 --> 09:42.715
Oh, that's just
something people say

09:42.782 --> 09:43.716
when they give you a present.

09:43.783 --> 09:44.850
"Oh, it's no big deal."

09:44.917 --> 09:46.786
It's always a big deal.

09:46.852 --> 09:48.054
Hey.

09:48.120 --> 09:49.755
You know that iCarly thing
we do?

09:49.822 --> 09:51.157
Yeah, it's time for that.

09:51.223 --> 09:53.259
-I can't believe you.
-Look,

09:53.326 --> 09:54.827
make me another shirt
if you wanna

09:54.894 --> 09:56.128
after we go
to the Cuddlefish concert.

09:56.195 --> 09:57.263
I'm not going to the concert
with you.

09:57.330 --> 09:58.864
Oh, now,
you're being ridiculous.

09:58.931 --> 10:00.533
Better than being
a gift-giver-awayer.

10:00.599 --> 10:01.834
-Just forget it.
-Fine.

10:01.901 --> 10:03.436
-Don't go to the concert.
-I won't.

10:03.502 --> 10:05.104
-I don't even care.
-I care way less than you care.

10:05.171 --> 10:06.472
You don't know
how much I don't care.

10:06.539 --> 10:08.240
Oh, all you ever think
about is ham.

10:08.307 --> 10:09.809
I'd rather have a shirt
made of ham.

10:09.875 --> 10:11.510
I can't believe
you just gave it away.

10:11.577 --> 10:13.379
I can't believe we're having
this stupid conversation.

10:13.446 --> 10:15.247
-Don't talk to me.
-I'm not talkin' to you.

10:15.314 --> 10:16.816
By saying you're talking to me,
you are talking to me.

10:16.882 --> 10:18.084
-It is not.
-Just don't talk to me.

10:18.150 --> 10:19.652
-Don't talk to me. Fine.
-Fine.

10:19.719 --> 10:21.087
-Whatever.
-Whatevs.

10:22.221 --> 10:23.389
Oh, why would I make you
another one?

10:23.456 --> 10:25.124
Good, 'cause I don't want
another one.

10:25.191 --> 10:26.425
I thought you said
you weren't gonna talk to me.

10:26.492 --> 10:27.760
I'll stop
when you stop talkin' to me.

10:27.827 --> 10:29.195
Don't you give me ultimatums.

10:29.261 --> 10:30.930
Don't use words
I can't understand.

10:32.331 --> 10:34.133
You clearly don't care
about my feelings.

10:34.200 --> 10:35.868
And you clearly
won't stop talkin' to me.

10:35.935 --> 10:37.670
Yeah, 'cause you keep sucking
me back into the conversation.

10:37.737 --> 10:39.372
Ten seconds.

10:39.438 --> 10:40.573
Why don't you just forget about
the shirt and the concert?

10:40.639 --> 10:41.874
Fine.

10:41.941 --> 10:43.042
Good 'cause I'm takin'
Melanie Katz

10:43.109 --> 10:44.677
to see Cuddlefish with me.

10:44.744 --> 10:46.379
Oh, like, you're such
good friends with Melanie Katz.

10:46.445 --> 10:48.147
That's right.
Melanie Katz is my best friend.

10:48.214 --> 10:49.815
Then you should know
she's been in the hospital

10:49.882 --> 10:51.150
since last Christmas.

10:51.217 --> 10:53.419
-So, I forgot.
-We're live.

10:53.486 --> 10:54.653
Hola, señors.

10:54.720 --> 10:55.788
And señoritas.

10:55.855 --> 10:56.956
Welcome to iCarly.

10:57.023 --> 10:58.057
Me llamo Carly.

10:58.124 --> 10:59.692
And you may-yammo me Sam.

10:59.759 --> 11:01.127
Arriba!

11:01.193 --> 11:04.597
[both laugh]
[both groan]

11:04.663 --> 11:05.931
Okay.

11:05.998 --> 11:07.633
Before we do our thing...

11:07.700 --> 11:09.502
We're startin' off the show
with a viewer-submitted video.

11:09.568 --> 11:11.771
Check out this clip
of a little girl giving her mom

11:11.837 --> 11:13.172
a big surprise.

11:16.342 --> 11:18.677
Okay, honey.
Open your next present.

11:18.744 --> 11:20.079
Oh, this is a big one.

11:21.447 --> 11:23.582
-Happy birthday, Mommy.
-[screams]

11:25.017 --> 11:27.920
Poor mom had no idea
that was comin'.

11:27.987 --> 11:29.688
-Heck of a birthday present.
-Yes.

11:29.755 --> 11:31.257
A present I'm sure
that little girl's mom

11:31.323 --> 11:32.892
wouldn't trade for anything

11:32.958 --> 11:35.327
since it came from someone
she cares about.

11:37.396 --> 11:39.465
Yeah, but I bet
if she traded it for something

11:39.532 --> 11:41.434
that they could
both do together,

11:41.500 --> 11:43.202
the daughter
would have been happy

11:43.269 --> 11:46.639
and not freaked out about it
like a psycho maniac.

11:46.705 --> 11:48.240
Maybe you should just do
the show without me.

11:48.307 --> 11:49.542
No, you do it without me.

11:49.608 --> 11:51.010
Don't you walk away
from me, Sam.

11:51.077 --> 11:52.511
Too late, I'm already leaving.

11:52.578 --> 11:53.779
Yeah, 'cause you know
what you did was wrong.

11:53.846 --> 11:54.880
Keep dreamin'.

11:54.947 --> 11:56.215
Why can't you ever just admit

11:56.282 --> 11:57.249
what you did was wrong
and apologize?

11:57.316 --> 11:58.451
Why don't you quit yappin'

11:58.517 --> 11:59.785
before you get
on my last nerve?

11:59.852 --> 12:01.487
You can never back down,
can you?

12:01.554 --> 12:02.721
-I got no reason to back down.
-What you did was horrible.

12:02.788 --> 12:03.756
Your attitude is horrible.

12:03.823 --> 12:05.257
-Oh, is it?
-Sure is.

12:05.324 --> 12:07.126
iCarly is experiencing
technical difficulties.

12:08.060 --> 12:12.531
[mimics static]

12:27.046 --> 12:29.515
Hey, Sam, love my shirt.

12:37.056 --> 12:38.624
Would you guys
just quit fighting

12:38.691 --> 12:39.758
and make up already?

12:39.825 --> 12:40.960
Sure.

12:41.026 --> 12:42.995
As soon as Sam apologizes.

12:43.062 --> 12:45.764
I've got nothing
to apologize for.

12:45.831 --> 12:47.466
And neither do I.

12:49.301 --> 12:50.603
Okay.

12:50.669 --> 12:53.439
Okay. Okay!

12:54.773 --> 12:57.776
This is so stupid.
You guys are best friends.

12:57.843 --> 12:58.944
Were best friends.

12:59.011 --> 13:00.579
-Bleh!
-Bleh!

13:00.646 --> 13:03.115
both: Bleh! Bleh! Bleh! Bleh!

13:03.182 --> 13:04.350
Hey!

13:06.519 --> 13:08.120
And what about iCarly?

13:08.187 --> 13:09.388
If you two hate each other,

13:09.455 --> 13:11.757
what's gonna happen
to the show?

13:11.824 --> 13:14.326
Think about our fans and me.

13:14.393 --> 13:16.595
Without iCarly,
I'm back to painting clay mugs

13:16.662 --> 13:19.064
with my mom at "Color Me Pot."

13:22.501 --> 13:24.503
Maybe Freddie is right.

13:24.570 --> 13:25.771
Yeah.

13:25.838 --> 13:28.307
Maybe things got
a little out of control.

13:28.374 --> 13:30.576
And this whole thing happened
'cause we were trying to do

13:30.643 --> 13:32.278
something nice for each other.

13:32.344 --> 13:33.746
So--

13:33.812 --> 13:35.481
If I say, "I'm sorry,"
will you?

13:35.548 --> 13:36.782
Sure.

13:36.849 --> 13:38.284
Look, Sam, I didn't mean
to say that--

13:38.350 --> 13:39.652
Oh, man, Sam,
thank you so much for taking me

13:39.718 --> 13:41.020
to the Cuddlefish concert.

13:41.086 --> 13:42.288
It was the most
awesome concert ever.

13:42.354 --> 13:44.056
Remember at the end
when they played

13:44.123 --> 13:45.191
"Rock Me, Love Me,"
and we held up our cell phones

13:45.257 --> 13:46.592
to illuminate the darkness?

13:46.659 --> 13:48.460
Whoa, I have to go
to algebra class. Bye.

13:51.564 --> 13:53.465
You went to the concert?

13:53.532 --> 13:54.767
And you took Tareen?

13:54.833 --> 13:56.368
Oh, no.

13:56.435 --> 13:57.603
You refused to go.

13:57.670 --> 13:58.904
I wasn't just gonna
waste the tickets.

13:58.971 --> 14:00.539
You got those for us.

14:00.606 --> 14:02.308
They were so close.

14:02.374 --> 14:04.109
You said you weren't gonna come

14:04.176 --> 14:06.312
right before you called me
a gift-giver-awayer.

14:06.378 --> 14:08.047
I can't believe
I almost made up with you.

14:08.113 --> 14:09.515
Back at you.

14:09.582 --> 14:11.083
You were about to hug.

14:19.358 --> 14:21.927
Why were you just slamming
those lockers?

14:21.994 --> 14:22.995
But I wasn't.

14:23.062 --> 14:24.697
You see it was that--

14:24.763 --> 14:27.933
-Come with me.
-Oh!

14:29.168 --> 14:32.371
[knock at door]

14:32.438 --> 14:34.707
-Hey, Spencer.
-Hey, Fred-o.

14:34.773 --> 14:36.375
-Carly's not home yet.
-I know.

14:36.442 --> 14:37.876
But can I still come in though?

14:37.943 --> 14:39.645
-Do you need to borrow money?
-No.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.480
Please come in.

14:48.220 --> 14:50.155
What's the matter?
You look glum.

14:50.222 --> 14:51.824
-I am glum.
-Why so glum?

14:51.890 --> 14:54.927
-Can we stop saying glum?
-Sure.

14:54.994 --> 14:56.495
Carly and Sam
are still fighting.

14:56.562 --> 14:58.297
Yeah, I've been worried
about Carly.

14:58.364 --> 15:01.133
She's been really glum--glumpy.

15:03.135 --> 15:04.503
Things haven't gotten better?

15:04.570 --> 15:06.772
They've gotten
the opposite of better.

15:06.839 --> 15:08.440
So worse.

15:09.975 --> 15:11.210
Uh-huh.

15:14.046 --> 15:15.781
And we have to do
the web show tonight.

15:15.848 --> 15:18.217
But they'll probably just
start screamin' at each other,

15:18.284 --> 15:19.852
and I'll have to fake
technical difficulties

15:19.918 --> 15:22.354
and go--
[mimics static]

15:22.421 --> 15:25.457
Again.

15:25.524 --> 15:27.993
Look, in my life,

15:28.060 --> 15:30.596
I've learned a thing
or two about girls.

15:30.663 --> 15:31.897
Like?

15:31.964 --> 15:34.266
Like when you break up
with them,

15:34.333 --> 15:37.503
they do not like it
when you ask out their sister.

15:37.569 --> 15:40.139
That'll get you a fork
in your arm.

15:40.205 --> 15:41.874
How does this help me?

15:41.940 --> 15:43.509
Look, when girls get mad
about something,

15:43.575 --> 15:45.277
they just wanna be told
they're right.

15:45.344 --> 15:46.979
Well, then,
that's a big problem,

15:47.046 --> 15:49.548
'cause Carly and Sam
can't both be right.

15:49.615 --> 15:51.950
Or can they?

15:52.017 --> 15:54.753
No, you're right, they can't.

15:54.820 --> 15:58.757
So do you have anything
helpful to say here?

15:58.824 --> 15:59.858
-Helpful?
-Yeah.

15:59.925 --> 16:01.760
No.

16:01.827 --> 16:04.963
But hey, you wanna check out
my automatic fish feeder?

16:05.030 --> 16:06.598
I'm making it
a lot more complicated

16:06.665 --> 16:07.666
than it needs to be.

16:07.733 --> 16:09.635
-Why?
-'Cause it's fun.

16:09.702 --> 16:13.305
It's not finished yet,
but check it out.

16:13.372 --> 16:14.540
Okay.

16:14.606 --> 16:16.275
This car is gonna go
around this track,

16:16.342 --> 16:18.377
hit this thing, hit that tank,
shoot at that target,

16:18.444 --> 16:19.878
spill fish flakes
into that bowl.

16:19.945 --> 16:21.413
Here we go.

16:22.948 --> 16:27.553
[whirring and beeping]

16:30.422 --> 16:31.790
Swimmy!

16:31.857 --> 16:32.991
I thought that was Brock.

16:33.058 --> 16:34.693
Brock!

16:41.066 --> 16:42.701
Oh, phew.

16:42.768 --> 16:44.570
That was close.

16:44.636 --> 16:45.804
Brock is okay.

16:45.871 --> 16:47.172
Okay.

16:47.239 --> 16:48.474
I'm gonna see
if I can think of a way

16:48.540 --> 16:49.908
to fix things
with Carly and Sam.

16:49.975 --> 16:51.477
Think well, Fred-o.

17:06.858 --> 17:08.727
I wanna start off
doin' my impression of a cat

17:08.794 --> 17:09.828
in a dishwasher.

17:09.895 --> 17:10.963
I told you, we're starting

17:11.029 --> 17:12.231
with the Mexican jump-rope bit.

17:12.297 --> 17:13.732
That bit stinks.

17:13.799 --> 17:15.334
Your attitude stinks
and I'm in charge

17:15.401 --> 17:16.667
of what we do on "iCarly."

17:16.734 --> 17:18.337
Well, I'm doin' the cat
in a dishwasher.

17:18.404 --> 17:19.805
Mexican jump-rope.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.205
Wrong, both of you.

17:21.272 --> 17:22.307
-Huh?
-What?

17:22.374 --> 17:23.474
Tonight, I'm in charge

17:23.541 --> 17:25.243
of how we're starting the show.

17:25.310 --> 17:26.712
Look, you just point
your little camera, tech boy.

17:26.779 --> 17:27.846
Yeah, don't tell us how--

17:27.913 --> 17:29.381
We start the show how I say,

17:29.448 --> 17:31.049
or you guys can get yourself
a new tech producer.

17:31.116 --> 17:33.085
-He's bluffin'.
-I don't bluff.

17:33.952 --> 17:35.921
Okay, I was bluffin'
when I said I don't bluff,

17:35.988 --> 17:38.891
but I'm serious about quittin'.

17:38.957 --> 17:40.259
Fine, what do you want us
to do?

17:40.325 --> 17:41.927
-Go put your hair in ponytails.
-Why?

17:41.994 --> 17:44.329
-Why do you want--
-Ponytails!

17:44.396 --> 17:45.697
Okay. We'll put our hair
in ponytails.

17:45.764 --> 17:48.267
-No need to be so assertive.
-Bossy.

17:51.437 --> 17:57.075
And in five, four, three, two.

17:57.142 --> 17:58.710
Hello, people of Earth
and beyond.

17:58.777 --> 18:01.513
This is a little web show
we like to call "iCarly."

18:02.781 --> 18:04.116
I'm Carly.

18:04.183 --> 18:05.784
And I'm Sam.

18:05.851 --> 18:07.219
And I'm Freddie.

18:07.286 --> 18:08.821
Now, usually,
I'm behind the camera.

18:08.887 --> 18:11.523
Where you should be.

18:11.590 --> 18:14.293
But tonight, we're gonna
shake it up a little bit.

18:14.359 --> 18:16.195
-Can't wait.
-Yay.

18:17.429 --> 18:19.531
See, Carly and Sam
are in a big fight.

18:19.598 --> 18:21.233
And both girls think
they're right.

18:21.300 --> 18:23.001
-I am right.
-You am wrong.

18:23.068 --> 18:25.003
You am obnoxious.

18:25.070 --> 18:26.338
See?

18:26.405 --> 18:27.673
But this fight
is gonna end tonight

18:27.739 --> 18:29.942
because you,
the fans of "iCarly,"

18:30.008 --> 18:31.276
are gonna decide who's right

18:31.343 --> 18:33.212
by voting online,
after the show,

18:33.278 --> 18:35.147
right here at iCarly.com.

18:35.214 --> 18:37.483
So what does this have to do
with tying up our ponytails?

18:37.549 --> 18:39.618
I was getting to that.

18:39.685 --> 18:42.154
Both girls are about to give
their sides of the story.

18:42.221 --> 18:44.122
But if either girl interrupts,

18:44.189 --> 18:46.225
says something insulting,
or yells,

18:46.291 --> 18:47.926
her ponytail will be yanked.

18:47.993 --> 18:49.328
Hard.

18:49.394 --> 18:51.864
-This is ridiculous.
-I ain't doin' this.

18:51.930 --> 18:54.666
-Ow!
-Ow!

18:54.733 --> 18:56.068
Very good.

18:56.134 --> 18:58.537
And now, the first girl
to speak will be Carly.

18:58.604 --> 19:00.038
<i>Boo.</i>

19:00.105 --> 19:01.807
She pressed the boo button.

19:01.874 --> 19:03.709
Ow!

19:03.775 --> 19:06.278
Drop the remote.

19:06.345 --> 19:08.647
-Carly, you may begin.
-Okay.

19:08.714 --> 19:10.649
It started when I gave Sam
an "iCarly" T-shirt

19:10.716 --> 19:12.618
that I worked so hard to make.

19:12.684 --> 19:14.253
It was a really special gift,

19:14.319 --> 19:16.388
and then she traded it
for concert tickets.

19:16.455 --> 19:18.257
You wanted to go
to that concert--ow!

19:18.323 --> 19:20.125
It's Carly's turn.

19:20.192 --> 19:22.327
But she--but I just--

19:22.394 --> 19:25.731
well, just let me say--
I'll be quiet.

19:25.797 --> 19:27.332
I put a lot of thought
into that gift

19:27.399 --> 19:29.234
and then Sam
just traded it away.

19:29.301 --> 19:31.870
And then she went
to the concert without me.

19:31.937 --> 19:34.406
-But--
-Ah!

19:34.473 --> 19:36.441
And Sam still hasn't apologized

19:36.508 --> 19:38.176
for trading away a present
that I made her.

19:38.243 --> 19:39.344
Mm-hmm.

19:39.411 --> 19:40.879
Very nice.

19:40.946 --> 19:43.582
Now Sam, you may give
your side of the story.

19:43.649 --> 19:45.083
Finally.

19:45.150 --> 19:47.653
Okay, first off, Carly said
the shirt was no big deal.

19:47.719 --> 19:49.388
And the tickets I got were
for Cuddlefish,

19:49.454 --> 19:51.456
a concert Carly told me
she was dying to go to.

19:51.523 --> 19:52.991
It's her favorite band.

19:53.058 --> 19:56.929
Let the record show that
Carly is fond of Cuddlefish.

19:56.995 --> 19:59.031
So, yeah, I traded the shirt,

19:59.097 --> 20:00.899
but it was to get something
Carly wanted a lot,

20:00.966 --> 20:02.801
something the two of us
could've done together.

20:02.868 --> 20:04.636
And Carly refused to go
to the concert so--

20:04.703 --> 20:06.805
I would've gone with you
if you'd just apologized.

20:06.872 --> 20:08.073
She interrupted me.

20:08.140 --> 20:09.141
Yank her ponytail.

20:09.207 --> 20:10.709
No, I'm gonna allow it.

20:11.743 --> 20:14.246
-Why?
-Because I love her.

20:14.313 --> 20:16.348
Give me the rope.

20:16.415 --> 20:18.483
Ow!
You're not the rope-keeper.

20:18.550 --> 20:20.986
-Ow!
-Ow!

20:21.053 --> 20:22.721
-It hurts.
-Stop.

20:22.788 --> 20:24.356
-You guys stop it.
-You stop.

20:24.423 --> 20:26.091
You're missing
the point of this activity.

20:26.158 --> 20:27.292
-Knock it off, you guys--
-Stop it.

20:27.359 --> 20:28.660
You're stressing
your ponytails.

20:31.797 --> 20:33.098
My hair feels like
it was attacked

20:33.165 --> 20:34.399
by a vacuum cleaner.

20:35.968 --> 20:38.070
Mine feels like it was yanked
by a Freddie.

20:39.237 --> 20:42.708
Could you please just hurry up
and count up the votes?

20:42.774 --> 20:43.675
Okay.

20:43.742 --> 20:45.344
Now before I tell you who won,

20:45.410 --> 20:47.346
do you guys promise
to accept the decision?

20:47.412 --> 20:48.513
Loser apologizes?

20:48.580 --> 20:49.982
-Sure.
-Okay.

20:50.048 --> 20:51.316
Then here we go.

20:51.383 --> 20:53.051
Sam, the number
of "iCarly" viewers

20:53.118 --> 20:55.454
who think you're right, 693.

20:55.520 --> 20:57.489
I got 693 votes.

20:57.556 --> 20:59.091
And how many votes did I get?

20:59.157 --> 21:00.359
Seven hundred and five.

21:00.425 --> 21:02.160
-Ha. Looks like--
-Wait.

21:02.227 --> 21:04.429
I put up a third option
for them to vote for.

21:04.496 --> 21:05.697
-Huh?
-What?

21:05.764 --> 21:07.566
First button says
Carly's right.

21:07.633 --> 21:09.301
Second button said Sam's right.

21:09.368 --> 21:10.869
The third button said,

21:10.936 --> 21:12.671
"Carly and Sam
are both acting dumb,

21:12.738 --> 21:15.007
"and they should just make up
and be friends again."

21:17.342 --> 21:18.944
How many people voted
for that one?

21:19.011 --> 21:22.080
253,719.

21:24.116 --> 21:26.551
Our fans don't like it
when best friends fight.

21:27.853 --> 21:29.087
Neither do I.

21:31.323 --> 21:33.792
-Aw, Sam, you're crying.
-No.

21:35.360 --> 21:37.329
Freddie is just such a dork,

21:37.396 --> 21:39.698
it makes me
emotional sometimes.

21:41.600 --> 21:44.770
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

21:54.112 --> 21:57.115
Oh, I see hugging.

21:58.684 --> 22:00.352
Does everyone
like each other again?

22:00.419 --> 22:02.020
-Yes.
-Excellent.

22:02.087 --> 22:04.489
I say this calls
for a lovely fish dinner.

22:04.556 --> 22:06.191
-You're cooking fish?
-No.

22:06.258 --> 22:08.694
We're feeding dinner to a fish.

22:08.760 --> 22:09.995
My fish.

22:10.062 --> 22:11.463
I run to the kitchen.

22:14.099 --> 22:17.736
See, I finished
my automatic fish feeder.

22:19.671 --> 22:21.006
Are you children ready?

22:21.073 --> 22:23.542
-Ready.
-Oh, yeah.

22:35.554 --> 22:39.057
[futuristic whirring]

22:41.126 --> 22:45.197
[all cheering]

22:45.263 --> 22:47.733
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you very much.

22:47.799 --> 22:50.736
And now, I shall never again
forget to feed my fish.

22:50.802 --> 22:52.637
But wait, don't you
still have to remember

22:52.704 --> 22:54.639
to put that ball back
at the top every day?

22:57.676 --> 22:59.010
I'm going to bed.

23:04.850 --> 23:06.284
{\an8}You're takin' him
back to the pet store?

23:06.351 --> 23:07.886
{\an8}Yep.

23:14.159 --> 23:15.360
Hi, Carly, Sam, and Freddie.

23:15.427 --> 23:17.028
These balls are for you.

23:28.406 --> 23:30.375
"iCarly" rocks.
