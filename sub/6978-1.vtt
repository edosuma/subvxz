<i>In the last year of the World War,
the Tomainian nation began to weaken.</i>

02:57.040 --> 02:58.957
<i>Behind her lines
revolution had broken out.</i>

02:59.042 --> 03:00.959
<i>Her diplomats were frantically
suing for peace...</i>

03:01.044 --> 03:03.212
<i>while at the front
Tomainia's army fought on...</i>

03:03.296 --> 03:05.214
<i>confident its war machine
was invincible...</i>

03:05.298 --> 03:07.966
<i>confident its war machine
would smash the enemy's lines.</i>

03:08.051 --> 03:10.969
<i>Big Bertha, a cannon that could
hurl a projectile a hundred miles...</i>

03:11.054 --> 03:13.639
<i>was this day to make
its first appearance on the Western Front...</i>

03:13.723 --> 03:16.391
<i>was this day to strike terror
into the hearts of the enemy.</i>

03:16.476 --> 03:20.812
<i>Seventy-five miles away was her target,
the cathedral of Notre Dame.</i>

03:23.566 --> 03:26.527
Range: 95,452!

03:26.611 --> 03:29.071
- Range: 95,452!
- Yes, sir!

03:29.155 --> 03:31.698
- Stand clear!
- Fire!

03:48.466 --> 03:50.717
Hey!
Stand by your trigger.

03:50.802 --> 03:52.344
Yes, sir.

03:52.428 --> 03:56.098
Range correction: 95,455!

03:56.182 --> 03:58.767
- Range: 95,455!
- Yes, sir!

03:59.644 --> 04:01.103
Breach secured!

04:01.187 --> 04:02.354
Stand clear!

04:02.438 --> 04:04.106
Ready! Fire!

04:19.956 --> 04:22.749
Defective shell.
We'll examine it. Come on.

04:22.834 --> 04:28.005
Come on.

04:32.760 --> 04:35.137
- We'd better check the fuse.
- Yes, check the fuse.

04:35.221 --> 04:37.222
Yes, sir. The fuse.

05:10.757 --> 05:13.258
Look out! Come on! Run!

05:28.232 --> 05:29.983
- What's that?
- An air raid!

05:30.068 --> 05:32.819
- They're after Big Bertha!
- Right! To the antiaircraft gun!

05:32.904 --> 05:34.571
- To the gun!
- Quick!

06:00.431 --> 06:02.766
Hey! Have you gone crazy?

06:02.850 --> 06:04.851
Come down out of there!

06:14.570 --> 06:16.405
Get up there, will you!

06:16.489 --> 06:18.907
What do you think you're doing?
Have you gone crazy?

06:18.991 --> 06:21.034
- Sorry, sir -
- Sir! Report from Captain Snout!

06:21.119 --> 06:23.161
The enemy have broken through!
Every man to the front!

06:23.246 --> 06:26.039
Muster the gun crew, quick!
You, report to Sergeant Bloom.

06:26.124 --> 06:27.624
- Come on!
- Yes, sir!

06:27.709 --> 06:30.252
Get your hand grenades there, soldiers.

06:30.336 --> 06:32.045
Come on there.
Get your hand grenades.

06:32.130 --> 06:34.548
Hey, soldier! Where's your hand grenade?
Hey, come here!

06:34.632 --> 06:36.550
- Where's your hand grenade?
- Haven't got any, sir.

06:36.634 --> 06:38.552
Give him a hand grenade.
Go on.

06:43.266 --> 06:45.183
Keep moving. Come along.
Move forward.

06:45.268 --> 06:47.269
Hurry it up.
Come along. Hurry up.

06:47.353 --> 06:49.771
Pardon me, sir, but to work this -
How do you -

06:49.856 --> 06:51.857
Pull the pin, count 10 and throw it.

07:03.828 --> 07:06.371
Let 'em have it!

07:17.675 --> 07:19.301
Hey, come on!

07:27.351 --> 07:29.352
Hey, this is no time to scratch.

07:33.691 --> 07:36.067
Here, pull yourself together.

07:36.152 --> 07:37.652
Take this.

07:38.696 --> 07:39.988
Forward!

07:40.990 --> 07:43.450
Hey, you men! Fall in here!

07:43.534 --> 07:46.077
Hey, you, come on!
Hurry it up there!

07:50.708 --> 07:52.417
Order! Arms!

07:54.879 --> 07:56.463
Prepare to attack!

07:56.547 --> 07:58.006
Forward!

08:11.562 --> 08:12.896
Captain!

08:22.073 --> 08:23.573
<i>Capitán!</i>

08:39.590 --> 08:41.842
There you are.

08:50.601 --> 08:52.185
Oh, excuse me!

08:52.270 --> 08:55.188
The enemy!
Come on, fellas! Let's get him!

09:02.196 --> 09:04.614
Good afternoon, sir. May I come in?

09:04.699 --> 09:06.783
- Who is it?
- Friend.

09:06.868 --> 09:08.535
Come in.

09:10.997 --> 09:12.372
- Sir.
- What division?

09:12.456 --> 09:13.874
21 st Artillery, sir.

09:13.958 --> 09:15.876
Take this. Hold 'em off.
And keep firing.

09:15.960 --> 09:17.961
- I'll be back in a moment.
- Yes, sir.

09:35.229 --> 09:37.647
Help! Comrade, help!

09:43.821 --> 09:45.739
- What is it?
- I'm exhausted.

09:45.823 --> 09:47.866
Quick! Help me to my plane!

09:47.950 --> 09:49.951
Yes, sir.

09:50.995 --> 09:52.621
- Thank you, my lad.
- Steady.

09:52.705 --> 09:54.956
I'll see you get
the Tomainian Cross for this.

09:55.041 --> 09:57.876
That's all right, sir.
I'm only too willing to oblige.

10:06.010 --> 10:08.303
Oh, you saved my life.

10:08.387 --> 10:10.472
- Thank you.
- I'll strap you in.

10:10.556 --> 10:12.724
I'm weak.
I can't make it alone.

10:12.808 --> 10:14.768
- You'll have to stay with me.
- All right, sir.

10:14.852 --> 10:17.145
- Can you fly a plane?
- I can try.

10:19.190 --> 10:22.943
Quick! Lift my hand to the stick.
I haven't the strength.

10:23.027 --> 10:26.112
- Take charge of that gun, Sergeant!
- Yes, sir!

10:26.197 --> 10:29.741
The enemy! They're coming!
Quick! Lift my hand to the throttle!

10:29.825 --> 10:32.869
We'll fool 'em!

10:54.308 --> 10:56.309
- Here. Hold on to these dispatches.
- Yes, sir.

10:56.394 --> 11:00.021
If we can deliver them to General Schmelloffel,
Tomainia may yet win the day!

11:02.400 --> 11:05.151
- I think I'm going to faint.
- Oh, don't say that.

11:05.236 --> 11:07.278
I'm sorry, old man.

11:07.363 --> 11:09.155
- Huh?
- I'm sorry.

11:09.240 --> 11:11.241
Oh, wait - Please! Hey!

11:11.325 --> 11:13.159
Hey, mister!

11:14.954 --> 11:16.871
- Hey!
- Where am I?

11:16.956 --> 11:19.165
- Don't you know me?
- Oh, yes. Of course.

11:19.250 --> 11:20.834
- Of course.
- Yes.

11:20.918 --> 11:23.003
Yes, I - I feel better now.

11:23.087 --> 11:25.547
- Ah.
- The blood's returning to my head.

11:25.631 --> 11:27.424
What's below?

11:27.508 --> 11:29.509
- Looks like the sun.
- The sun?

11:29.593 --> 11:32.303
- Seems to be shining upwards.
- Strange.

11:32.388 --> 11:35.015
- How's the gas?
- Terrible. It kept me awake all night.

11:35.099 --> 11:37.183
No, no, no!
The gasoline in the tank!

11:37.268 --> 11:39.352
Oh. Almost empty.

11:39.437 --> 11:42.355
We must be nearly there.
What time is it?

11:42.440 --> 11:43.815
Time?

11:43.899 --> 11:47.235
About, approximately, one minute to 12:00.

11:52.450 --> 11:53.950
Strange.

11:55.244 --> 11:56.870
Look at that.

12:00.416 --> 12:03.126
Seem to be defying
the laws of gravity.

12:08.215 --> 12:09.716
Water!

12:09.800 --> 12:11.217
- Huh?
- Quick! I'm going to faint!

12:11.302 --> 12:13.595
Uh, wait a while. Wait a wh -

12:13.679 --> 12:16.765
You'll get - We'll get into trouble
if you faint any more now.

12:16.849 --> 12:18.349
- Ohh. Ohh.
- Now be careful.

12:18.434 --> 12:19.726
- Here now. Just hold it.
- Quick.

12:19.810 --> 12:22.896
Hold it. Hold it. I think I can - We'll just see -

12:22.980 --> 12:25.356
Faint. Water.

12:27.443 --> 12:29.944
- What on -
- Oh, water.

12:30.029 --> 12:32.405
- Here, take it!
- Oh! Quick!

12:32.490 --> 12:34.574
There's something wrong.

12:34.658 --> 12:36.451
Oh, I can't reach it.

12:36.535 --> 12:39.162
Oh, water! Faint!

12:39.246 --> 12:41.247
Ah! Oh, it's all gone!

12:41.332 --> 12:43.041
What's the matter?

12:43.125 --> 12:45.293
- This belt is too tight.
- Well, loosen it.

12:45.377 --> 12:46.795
I'm trying to.

12:48.506 --> 12:50.423
We're upside down.

12:50.508 --> 12:52.425
- I know it.
- Give me that stick!

12:52.510 --> 12:53.760
Impossible.

12:53.844 --> 12:55.720
Oh. There it goes.

12:55.805 --> 12:57.514
We're out of gas.

12:57.598 --> 13:00.600
Well, I suppose this is the end.

13:00.684 --> 13:02.519
- Cigarette?
- Not now.

13:02.603 --> 13:04.604
Then I shan't need this anymore.

13:04.688 --> 13:06.272
What month is it?

13:06.357 --> 13:07.690
April.

13:07.775 --> 13:10.026
Spring in Tomainia.

13:10.111 --> 13:13.613
Hilda will be in the garden now
tending the daffodils.

13:13.697 --> 13:16.282
How she loves daffodils.

13:16.367 --> 13:19.494
She would never cut them
for fear of hurting them.

13:19.578 --> 13:23.206
It was like taking a life
to cut a daffodil.

13:23.290 --> 13:26.251
Sweet, gentle Hilda.

13:31.799 --> 13:34.008
A beautiful soul.

13:34.093 --> 13:36.177
And she loved animals.

13:36.262 --> 13:38.388
And little children too.

13:43.769 --> 13:45.937
We've landed! Dispatches!

13:46.021 --> 13:47.981
Comrade, where are you?

13:48.065 --> 13:49.399
Comrade!

13:54.572 --> 13:57.448
Comrade, the dispatches!
Tell me, where are they?

14:00.494 --> 14:02.745
- Are you hurt?
- Quick! Take me to General Schmelloffel!

14:02.830 --> 14:04.122
- What's that?
- Hurry, man!

14:04.206 --> 14:07.083
If I don't deliver these dispatches at once,
we're defeated!

14:07.168 --> 14:08.585
- Well, the war's over.
- What?

14:08.669 --> 14:10.461
- We lost.
- Lost?

15:05.559 --> 15:06.976
<i>Hynkel Party Takes Power!</i>

15:07.061 --> 15:09.979
<i>Meanwhile, the Jewish soldier,
ex-barber, veteran of the World War...</i>

15:10.064 --> 15:13.399
<i>suffered a loss of memory and remained an inmate
of the soldier's hospital for many years.</i>

15:13.484 --> 15:16.277
<i>He was ignorant of the profound change
that had come over Tomainia.</i>

15:16.362 --> 15:19.030
<i>Hynkel the dictator ruled the nation
with an iron fist.</i>

15:19.114 --> 15:21.699
<i>Under the new emblem of the Double Cross
liberty was banished...</i>

15:21.784 --> 15:23.243
<i>free speech was suppressed...</i>

15:23.327 --> 15:25.453
<i>and only the voice of Hynkel was heard.</i>

15:30.292 --> 15:32.001
<i>...und ze sauerkraut!</i>

15:48.394 --> 15:50.019

15:50.104 --> 15:53.106

16:09.790 --> 16:11.708
<i>Adenoid Hynkel has just said...</i>

16:11.792 --> 16:14.794
<i>yesterday Tomainia was down,
but today she has risen.</i>

16:32.104 --> 16:34.314
<i>Democratzy shtunk!</i>

16:34.398 --> 16:36.107
<i>Democracy is fragrant.</i>

16:38.193 --> 16:39.986
<i>Liberty is odious.</i>

16:42.573 --> 16:44.991
<i>Freedom of speech is objectionable.</i>

16:48.370 --> 16:50.496
<i>Tomainia has the greatest army in the world.</i>

16:52.583 --> 16:54.500
<i>The greatest navy in the world.</i>

16:58.839 --> 17:01.257
<i>But to remain great we must sacrifice.</i>

17:04.636 --> 17:06.554
<i>We must tighten our belts.</i>

17:06.637 --> 17:07.930
Hail Hynkel!

Ah, Herring.

21:38.827 --> 21:40.745
<i>Da banana!</i>

21:45.876 --> 21:47.460
<i>- Da banana!
- Da bitte booben!</i>

21:49.796 --> 21:51.797
<i>- Banana!
- Banana!</i>

21:51.882 --> 21:55.384
<i>Dein big booben!
Cheesen crackers!</i>

21:55.469 --> 21:56.886
<i>Banana.</i>

22:03.435 --> 22:05.353
Inside, da booben.

22:05.437 --> 22:07.938
You ride in the other car.

22:12.402 --> 22:14.070
Thank you, children.

22:15.989 --> 22:17.907
<i>His Excellency seems well pleased...</i>

22:17.991 --> 22:22.495
<i>as he's greeted by a committee
of Tomainian children and their mothers.</i>

22:22.579 --> 22:25.790
<i>Now he pauses
before a woman with a child.</i>

22:28.168 --> 22:30.002
Camera.

22:30.087 --> 22:32.004
<i>Even the baby is thrilled...</i>

22:32.089 --> 22:34.715
<i>and seems all smiles
at His Excellency's attention.</i>

22:57.322 --> 22:59.365
Hail Hynkel!

22:59.449 --> 23:01.784
<i>His Excellency leaves
the scene of his triumph...</i>

23:01.868 --> 23:04.787
<i>and will return to the palace along
Hynkelstrasse, the avenue of culture...</i>

23:04.871 --> 23:07.123
<i>where he will pass Tomainia's
modern masterpieces...</i>

23:07.207 --> 23:09.709
The Venus of Today
and The Thinker of Tomorrow.

23:18.677 --> 23:20.052
- How was it?
- The speech?

23:20.137 --> 23:22.304
- Yes.
- Oh, very good.

23:22.389 --> 23:25.641
Thought your reference to the Jews
might have been a little more violent.

23:25.726 --> 23:28.477
- What?
- You've got to rouse the people's anger.

23:28.562 --> 23:33.065
At this time, violence against the Jews
might take the public's mind off its stomach.

23:33.150 --> 23:35.067
Hmm. Perhaps you're right.

23:35.152 --> 23:37.737
Things have been quiet
in the ghetto lately.

24:01.511 --> 24:03.429
Good morning, Mr. Jaeckel.

24:03.513 --> 24:05.181
What's good about it?

24:05.265 --> 24:07.266
Well, conditions could be worse.

24:07.350 --> 24:10.770
If you think they could be worse,
you have a great imagination.

24:10.854 --> 24:13.063
Aha. You heard Hynkel's speech.

24:13.148 --> 24:16.400
I heard nothing.
I've got my own troubles.

24:16.485 --> 24:19.403
Well, you're better off
than a lot of other people.

24:19.488 --> 24:22.782
- What have you heard from the barber?
- Still in the hospital.

24:22.866 --> 24:25.534
Aye. Ever since the war
he's been there.

24:25.619 --> 24:26.869
Yep.

24:26.953 --> 24:29.580
Why don't you try and rent
his barbershop for him?

24:29.664 --> 24:31.624
He won't let me.

24:31.708 --> 24:34.460
Every few weeks
he writes to say he's coming back.

24:34.544 --> 24:37.630
It seems a pity it should be idle
all these years.

24:37.714 --> 24:39.632
Well, why worry?

24:39.716 --> 24:42.802
With the taxes the government
will soon take it away from him.

24:42.886 --> 24:44.595
Aye, perhaps you're right.

24:44.679 --> 24:46.806
It isn't such a good morning after all.

24:46.890 --> 24:48.891
Now you said it.

24:49.893 --> 24:52.645
- Hannah.
- Yes, Mr. Jaeckel?

24:52.729 --> 24:55.648
On the mantelpiece
you'll find my tobacco pouch.

24:55.732 --> 24:58.025
- Will you get it?
- All right, Mr. Jaeckel.

24:58.109 --> 25:01.153
Yeah, seems everyone
is full of troubles.

25:01.238 --> 25:02.988
Ah, everyone.

25:03.073 --> 25:04.990
Look at Hannah, poor girl.

25:05.075 --> 25:07.493
A hard worker.
Can't get a job.

25:07.577 --> 25:11.038
Father was killed in the war.
Mother died last year.

25:11.122 --> 25:14.667
Can't earn enough to pay the rent
for her room. What can I do?

25:14.751 --> 25:16.752
I can't throw her out.

25:25.136 --> 25:27.721
- You'll need some more tobacco.
- Where are you going?

25:27.806 --> 25:29.557
I'm delivering Mrs. Shoemaker's laundry.

25:29.641 --> 25:31.976
Oh, you'd better take the key.

25:32.060 --> 25:34.395
Mrs. Jaeckel and myself
are going out.

25:34.479 --> 25:36.397
I'm locking up all the doors...

25:36.481 --> 25:39.483
in case the storm troopers will start
their monkey business again.

25:51.872 --> 25:53.622
# The Aryan #

25:53.707 --> 25:57.126
<i># The Ary-Ary-Ary-Ary-Aryan #</i>

25:57.210 --> 26:00.462
# As we go marching by ##

26:01.298 --> 26:03.465
Look, fellas! Tomatoes!

26:03.550 --> 26:05.050
And potatoes!

26:07.554 --> 26:09.638
I think I'll take a box home.

26:09.723 --> 26:12.975
Mister, please, please.

26:13.059 --> 26:15.227
Hey, fellas, the truck!

26:15.312 --> 26:17.813
Hold it there, will ya!

26:19.399 --> 26:21.317
You have no right to do this.

26:21.401 --> 26:24.320
That's all right.
Just charge it to my account.

26:26.865 --> 26:28.782
Nice, ripe tomatoes, boys!

26:28.867 --> 26:33.245
Why don't some of you do something?
I wish I was a man. I'd show ya.

26:33.330 --> 26:35.581
Now what would you do,
my pretty maid?

26:35.665 --> 26:39.335
Ah, you're very brave all together, but not
one of ya got guts to stand up alone and fight.

26:39.419 --> 26:41.837
- Aw, shut up!
- Is that why you got a truck?

26:41.922 --> 26:44.840
- To run away in case somebody hits you back?
- Shut up, or we'll take you down.

26:44.925 --> 26:47.843
All right, come on and take me.
You'll get a lot of medals for it.

26:47.928 --> 26:50.763
That's all you can do is to pick on women
and rob defenseless people.

26:50.847 --> 26:54.266
Aw, don't rob the poor girl, boys.
Give her back her tomatoes.

26:54.351 --> 26:55.851
Here!

27:33.640 --> 27:37.309
Oh, I'll have to do it all over again.

27:39.562 --> 27:41.105
Pigs.

27:44.734 --> 27:47.403
<i>- Send in patient 33.
- Yes, sir.</i>

27:47.487 --> 27:49.071
Here's an interesting case.

27:49.155 --> 27:51.240
Amnesia. Jewish soldier.

27:51.324 --> 27:54.660
Been here since the war.
Has an idea he's been here only a few weeks.

27:54.744 --> 27:56.954
Has he any idea
what's happened in the meantime?

27:57.038 --> 27:58.455
Not the least.

27:58.540 --> 28:03.252
His one interest seems to be in his barbershop,
which he believes he left only a few weeks ago.

28:03.336 --> 28:05.754
Poor devil. He'll have
many surprises waiting for him.

28:05.839 --> 28:08.090
I'm afraid so.

28:08.174 --> 28:10.175
<i>- Yes?
- Number 33 is gone.</i>

28:10.260 --> 28:12.177
Gone?
But he was to be examined.

28:12.262 --> 28:15.180
<i>- I know, sir, but he disappeared.
- Disappeared?</i>

28:15.265 --> 28:18.517
Well, let him go.
It isn't a serious case.

28:18.601 --> 28:21.103
Besides, there's little more
we can do for him.

29:45.105 --> 29:47.689
Hey, go on.
Beat it up there.

29:47.774 --> 29:50.109
Come on! Get outta -
You! Go on!

30:14.968 --> 30:17.302
What do you think you're doing?

30:17.387 --> 30:20.139
- I really don't know.
- Well, you leave that alone.

30:21.391 --> 30:23.600
- Don't be silly.
- I'm not silly!

30:23.685 --> 30:25.102
I appreciate that.

30:25.186 --> 30:27.563
When you talk to me,
hail Hynkel and salute.

30:27.647 --> 30:29.148
Who are you anyway?

30:31.025 --> 30:33.068
I'll show you who I am.

30:33.153 --> 30:34.820
Come down to headquarters.

30:34.904 --> 30:37.823
- Say, that's my shop!
- I don't care if it is or not.

30:37.907 --> 30:40.659
- You leave me alone!
- Oh! Gonna put up a fight, are ya?

30:40.743 --> 30:43.829
Come on down, pal.
I'll show you.

30:43.913 --> 30:46.331
Now let me tell you something -

30:49.502 --> 30:52.588
Are you a policeman?
Arrest that man for assault.

30:52.672 --> 30:54.590
- Come here, you!
- Leave me alone!

30:54.674 --> 30:57.217
Attacking a storm trooper, huh?

30:57.302 --> 30:58.969
- Take him down!
- You'll hear from my lawyer!

30:59.053 --> 31:01.680
- Come on, you little -
- Why, you -

31:01.764 --> 31:04.808
Turn him around!

31:05.852 --> 31:07.186
He bit my finger!

31:41.429 --> 31:42.679
<i>Pardon.</i>

31:58.613 --> 32:01.114
Oh, I'm sorry, mister.
I didn't mean to hit you.

32:01.199 --> 32:03.158
You were wonderful.
I enjoyed that.

32:03.243 --> 32:06.078
- But don't stand there. You'd better beat it.
- No, I'll call a policeman.

32:06.162 --> 32:07.788
- No, no, don't do that.
- Why not?

32:07.872 --> 32:09.581
You crazy?

32:09.666 --> 32:11.583
- Look out. There's more coming.
- More what?

32:11.668 --> 32:13.377
Wait a minute!

32:19.175 --> 32:21.009
Come in here!

32:23.513 --> 32:26.431
What's wrong with you?
There's no use being foolhardy.

32:26.516 --> 32:28.183
- Who?
- Shh!

32:32.021 --> 32:33.897
Stop the car!

32:35.566 --> 32:38.443
Hello! What's this?
Who hit you?

32:38.528 --> 32:42.698
- I don't know. I think there were a gang of 'em.
- Here, you'd better go along, get fixed up.

32:42.782 --> 32:44.408
We'll investigate later.

32:44.492 --> 32:46.743
- What time is it?
- Come on. Get in.

32:55.461 --> 32:56.795
I don't see what is -

33:06.973 --> 33:09.141
It's all right now.
They've gone.

33:09.225 --> 33:10.809
Thanks, mister.

33:10.893 --> 33:13.020
That did me a lot of good.

33:15.648 --> 33:18.483
You sure got nerve,
the way you fought back.

33:18.568 --> 33:21.278
That's what we should all do -
fight back.

33:21.362 --> 33:24.781
We can't fight alone,
but we can lick 'em together.

33:26.367 --> 33:28.493
We didn't do so bad, did we?

33:28.578 --> 33:30.287
So long.

33:47.597 --> 33:49.097
Oh, excuse me.

33:49.182 --> 33:52.184
You're the barber,
the one that was in the hospital.

33:52.268 --> 33:56.480
Mr. Jaeckel's often talked about you.
We didn't think you were ever coming back.

33:58.441 --> 34:00.859
But the storm troopers,
they'll be looking for ya.

34:00.943 --> 34:02.194
Storm troopers?

34:02.278 --> 34:05.489
You'd better hide.
Wait. I'll get the key to the cellar.

34:13.581 --> 34:15.791
- Is this the man?
- That's him.

34:16.583 --> 34:18.043
Hail Hynkel.

34:18.127 --> 34:19.293
Who's he?

34:19.962 --> 34:23.047
Don't fool with me.
I said, hail Hynkel!

34:23.132 --> 34:25.300
- All right.
- Put out your hands.

34:25.385 --> 34:28.637
Just a moment. We won't put 'em on here.
Bring him outside.

34:28.721 --> 34:31.139
Yes. Come on, you.
Come on!

34:32.725 --> 34:35.726
Before we take you down
you'll finish this. Here.

34:37.438 --> 34:38.813
Go on. Paint that.

34:39.399 --> 34:41.149
Why, you -

34:52.911 --> 34:54.746
That's him!

35:17.812 --> 35:20.063
Wait a minute, boys! Wait a minute!

35:20.148 --> 35:22.607
I've got an idea.
A bright idea.

35:22.692 --> 35:25.026
Sure! That's it!

35:32.910 --> 35:37.289
- And... give it the works!
- Heave ho!

35:39.083 --> 35:40.792
Wait a minute! Commander Schultz!

35:41.544 --> 35:42.919
Attention!

35:46.757 --> 35:48.550
First in command.

35:49.844 --> 35:51.887
- Yes, sir.
- What the -

35:51.971 --> 35:53.889
Second in command.

35:55.099 --> 35:56.975
- Yes, sir.
- Oh, never mind.

35:57.059 --> 35:58.310
- You!
- Yes, sir.

35:58.394 --> 36:00.937
What the devil goes on here? And who
told you to hang people from lampposts?

36:01.022 --> 36:03.648
- No one, sir.
- My orders were to keep these streets tidy.

36:03.733 --> 36:06.193
- What was the trouble?
- A Jew was attacking storm troopers, sir.

36:06.277 --> 36:08.320
- Where is he?
- There.

36:08.404 --> 36:10.071
Break ranks.

36:12.325 --> 36:15.452
Oh, so there you are.
Stand him up.

36:16.120 --> 36:17.787
Get up.

36:23.377 --> 36:24.544
You!

36:25.546 --> 36:27.672
Don't you remember me?

36:27.757 --> 36:29.674
The war.
You saved my life.

36:29.759 --> 36:32.052
- Me?
- Strange.

36:32.136 --> 36:34.679
And I always thought of you as an Aryan.

36:34.764 --> 36:36.723
- I'm a vegetarian.
- Well, don't you remember?

36:36.807 --> 36:39.768
The enemy tried to capture us,
but we got away in my plane.

36:39.852 --> 36:41.269
Plane?

36:41.354 --> 36:43.939
And then we crashed.

36:44.023 --> 36:45.690
Cra -

36:48.277 --> 36:50.278
Oh, yes.

36:50.363 --> 36:52.030
Now I remember.

36:53.616 --> 36:56.159
- Well, how are you?
- What has my friend done?

36:56.244 --> 36:58.662
Our men were painting his windows,
Commander, and he resisted.

36:58.746 --> 37:00.747
Any brave man would resist.

37:00.831 --> 37:03.750
- I'm sorry this occurred.
- Oh. No harm.

37:03.834 --> 37:06.920
I'm sure that in the future
you will not be molested again.

37:07.004 --> 37:10.465
However, if you or your friends are ever
in any trouble, I hope you'll let me know.

37:13.135 --> 37:14.678
Who did that?

37:14.762 --> 37:17.806
Oh. One of my friends.

37:18.933 --> 37:21.268
Oh. Of course.

37:27.483 --> 37:30.402
<i>Hynkel's palace was
the center of a gigantic enterprise...</i>

37:30.486 --> 37:33.405
<i>an enterprise that would build
the world's greatest war machine.</i>

37:33.489 --> 37:36.408
<i>Behind this undertaking was
the dynamic energy of Adenoid Hynkel...</i>

37:36.492 --> 37:38.410
<i>whose amazing genius
ran the entire nation...</i>

37:38.494 --> 37:42.497
<i>whose ceaseless activity kept him
busily occupied every moment of the day.</i>

37:46.752 --> 37:48.253
Hup!

38:10.192 --> 38:11.818
<i>Marshal Herring is waiting,
Your Excellency.</i>

38:11.902 --> 38:13.194
Enough.

38:15.323 --> 38:16.573
Hail Hynkel.

38:16.657 --> 38:19.242
Your Excellency,
I believe we've got something now.

38:19.327 --> 38:22.621
A bulletproof uniform.
Material as light as silk.

38:22.705 --> 38:25.665
- Where is it?
- I've arranged for a demonstration in the anteroom.

38:25.750 --> 38:27.751
It will only take two minutes.

38:28.753 --> 38:30.420
I can spare one.

38:34.759 --> 38:37.302
- Professor Herr Kibitzen!
- Hail Hynkel!

38:37.386 --> 38:39.929
Your Excellency,
actions speak louder than words.

38:40.014 --> 38:43.433
- A bulletproof uniform!
- And 100% perfect!

38:45.061 --> 38:46.519
Shoot.

38:52.068 --> 38:53.652
Far from perfect.

39:31.107 --> 39:33.400
Zevell!

39:36.362 --> 39:38.780
- My secretary. Where is she?
- In the outer office, Your Excellency.

39:38.864 --> 39:40.198
- Call her.
- Yes, sir.

39:48.958 --> 39:50.792
Hail Hynkel.

39:52.461 --> 39:54.129
Take a letter.

40:08.686 --> 40:10.186
No! No, no!

40:19.655 --> 40:21.322
<i>- Hello?
- This is Field Marshal Herring.</i>

40:21.407 --> 40:23.908
<i>I'm in the Tower Room.
We've got something marvelous.</i>

40:23.993 --> 40:25.994
All right. I shall be up.

40:42.094 --> 40:43.762
- What is it?
- A parachute.

40:43.846 --> 40:47.432
The most compact in the world.
Worn like an ordinary hat.

40:49.602 --> 40:51.603
It will open in 25 feet.

40:51.687 --> 40:53.688
Demonstrate, Professor.

41:01.530 --> 41:02.947
Hail Hynkel!

41:13.459 --> 41:16.961
Herring, why do you
waste my time like this?

41:28.682 --> 41:30.183
Send Garbitsch here.

41:40.402 --> 41:42.987
<i>Herr Garbitsch is waiting, Your Excellency.</i>

41:43.072 --> 41:44.739
Enough.

41:48.536 --> 41:49.953
Hail Hynkel.

41:50.037 --> 41:52.038
Garbitsch, what's the meaning of this,
these appropriations?

41:52.122 --> 41:55.667
25 million for prison camps when we need
every penny for the manufacturing of munitions.

41:55.751 --> 41:58.169
- We've had to make a few arrests.
- A few? How many?

41:58.254 --> 41:59.921
Nothing astronomical.
Five or ten thousand.

42:00.005 --> 42:01.506
- Oh.
- A day.

42:01.590 --> 42:03.675
- A day?
- Just a few dissenters, that's all.

42:03.759 --> 42:06.886
- What do they dissent about?
- The working hours. The cut in wages.

42:06.971 --> 42:10.598
Chiefly, the synthetic food -
the quality of the sawdust in the bread.

42:10.683 --> 42:14.435
What more do they want? It's from
the finest lumber our mills can supply.

42:16.897 --> 42:19.524
Nevertheless,
the condition is getting dangerous.

42:19.608 --> 42:21.526
The people are overworked.
They need diversion.

42:21.610 --> 42:22.861
The people? Bah!

42:22.945 --> 42:26.155
We might go a little further with the Jews.
Burn down some of their houses.

42:26.240 --> 42:29.033
Spectacular assault on the ghetto now
might prove diverting.

42:29.118 --> 42:32.203
We must do something more dramatic.
Now is the time to invade Osterlich.

42:32.288 --> 42:34.706
- How soon can we be ready?
- According to Herring, three months.

42:34.790 --> 42:38.251
I can't wait that long. Besides, Napaloni's army
might invade Osterlich before me.

42:38.335 --> 42:39.711
We must strike now.

42:39.795 --> 42:41.838
In that case,
we should require foreign capital.

42:41.922 --> 42:44.716
- Borrow it. Borrow it.
- The bankers have all refused.

42:44.800 --> 42:47.677
But wait. There's one man
who might make us a loan - Epstein.

42:47.761 --> 42:50.013
Epstein?
He's a Jew, isn't he?

42:50.097 --> 42:51.890
Yes.

42:51.974 --> 42:55.476
Well, let's be big about it.
We'll borrow the money from Epstein.

42:56.645 --> 43:00.064
It might be difficult
in view of our policy towards his people.

43:00.149 --> 43:02.483
Very well then.
We'll change our policy towards his people.

43:02.568 --> 43:06.237
Tell Commander Schultz that in future
all persecution of the Jews must cease...

43:06.322 --> 43:09.699
at least until
we've negotiated this loan.

43:15.915 --> 43:17.498
I don't understand it.

43:17.583 --> 43:19.959
The whole ghetto is so quiet now.

43:20.044 --> 43:23.087
You can't imagine what was going on
while you were away.

43:23.172 --> 43:25.757
Oh, this Hynkel business.

43:25.841 --> 43:29.677
You weren't here.
You were in the hospital, unconscious.

43:29.762 --> 43:32.889
Believe me, you don't appreciate
what a good time you were having.

43:34.683 --> 43:37.769
Well, if things get worse
we can go to Osterlich.

43:37.853 --> 43:39.854
That's still a free country.

43:39.939 --> 43:42.774
Sooner or later we'll have to go.

43:42.858 --> 43:44.776
- Excuse me.
- Anyway...

43:44.860 --> 43:46.986
it's nice to see you back.

43:47.071 --> 43:48.988
It's like the old days again, eh?

43:49.073 --> 43:51.616
- Yes.
- How's business?

43:51.700 --> 43:53.660
Very slow. Very slow.

43:55.120 --> 43:58.289
Trouble is, the men
are all in concentration camps.

43:58.374 --> 44:01.125
You should go in
for fixing up the women.

44:01.210 --> 44:03.211
Nice money
in the beauty parlor business.

44:03.295 --> 44:06.214
You know anything about it?

44:09.218 --> 44:10.969
Me? No.

44:11.053 --> 44:13.012
Well, you can learn.

44:13.097 --> 44:14.597
You can practice on Hannah.

44:14.682 --> 44:16.349
Yes!

44:16.433 --> 44:19.352
Of course.
Hannah, get up in that chair.

44:19.436 --> 44:21.354
We are going to make you
look beautiful.

44:21.438 --> 44:23.106
Beautiful? What for?

44:23.190 --> 44:25.733
He's going to practice on you
for a beauty parlor.

44:28.487 --> 44:30.905
You're not gonna put mud
on my face, are you?

44:30.990 --> 44:33.324
Ah, we are going to take some off.

44:35.244 --> 44:36.953
Make me look beautiful?

44:37.037 --> 44:39.664
Sure. We can't make you
look any worse.

44:42.084 --> 44:45.336
- Hannah!
- Oh, there's Mrs. Shoemaker for the laundry.

44:45.421 --> 44:47.463
That's all right.
I'll give it to her.

44:47.548 --> 44:50.299
- You sit here and enjoy yourself.
- What?

44:50.384 --> 44:54.053
I know.
I've seen you making eyes.

44:56.056 --> 44:59.434
Don't pay any attention to Mr. Jaeckel.

45:02.104 --> 45:04.689
I like your shop since we fixed it up.

45:05.941 --> 45:08.026
I wish I had a business like this.

45:08.110 --> 45:10.486
There's no future in housework.

45:10.571 --> 45:13.489
Maybe if I save my money
I can have a barbershop someday.

45:13.574 --> 45:15.867
But I can never save.

45:15.951 --> 45:19.245
Money slips through my fingers
like that.

45:19.329 --> 45:22.540
Trouble is, I've always lived up
to every penny I've earned.

45:22.624 --> 45:26.294
Why shouldn't I? You're here today
and gone tomorrow. And then where are you?

45:28.047 --> 45:30.173
- Do you believe in God?
- Well -

45:30.257 --> 45:34.093
I do. But if there wasn't one,
would you live any different?

45:34.178 --> 45:38.347
I wouldn't. Life could be wonderful
if people'd leave you alone.

45:39.349 --> 45:41.392
Things are looking brighter now.

45:41.477 --> 45:45.146
Maybe you're the reason,
saving Commander Schultz's life.

45:45.230 --> 45:49.358
Funny how they've left us alone lately.
Seems too good to be true.

45:56.325 --> 45:58.242
Do you ever daydream?

45:58.327 --> 45:59.660
I do.

46:00.662 --> 46:04.499
That's the only time I'm really happy -
dreaming.

46:04.583 --> 46:06.084
Back.

46:08.378 --> 46:12.423
Sometimes I get so carried away I don't know
what I'm doing. Aren't you like that?

46:14.468 --> 46:16.594
- Do you know we're very much alike?
- Are we?

46:16.678 --> 46:18.262
Yeah.
We're both absentminded.

46:18.347 --> 46:19.972
- You think so?
- Yes.

46:24.019 --> 46:26.354
I like absentminded people.

46:31.193 --> 46:33.444
Do you know the story about the man
that put his watch in boiling water...

46:33.529 --> 46:34.946
and held the egg in his hand?

46:35.030 --> 46:36.781
No!

46:36.865 --> 46:39.325
Very good.

46:43.247 --> 46:45.164
They say all great men
are absentminded.

46:45.249 --> 46:48.084
It's a sign they're smart.

46:48.168 --> 46:50.169
My folks didn't think so.

46:53.173 --> 46:55.800
Of course there's an excuse for you.
You were injured in the war.

46:55.884 --> 46:58.553
I was born that way.

47:06.520 --> 47:08.437
Wonder why women
never grow whiskers.

47:08.522 --> 47:10.314
Hmm? What?

47:10.399 --> 47:11.899
I s -

47:14.903 --> 47:16.904
What -

47:18.115 --> 47:20.783
- Oh, my!
- Isn't that foolish of me!

47:20.868 --> 47:23.536
I could kick myself in the shins, I could.

47:24.746 --> 47:26.914
I'll give you a shampoo.

47:26.999 --> 47:28.499
That's good.

47:34.590 --> 47:35.923
Voilà.

47:40.095 --> 47:41.762
Gee.

47:42.806 --> 47:44.599
Ain't I cute!

47:47.060 --> 47:48.603
How'd you do it?

47:50.564 --> 47:53.191
You should try it on yourself.

47:53.275 --> 47:55.776
If you were fixed up,
you'd look handsome.

47:55.861 --> 47:57.737
- Yes?
- Yes!

47:59.781 --> 48:01.032
No.

48:01.116 --> 48:03.826
Four pecks a pound! New potatoes!

48:03.911 --> 48:07.121
There's the potato man.
I have to go.

48:10.876 --> 48:12.960
Potatoes!

48:13.045 --> 48:14.712
One, please!

48:20.886 --> 48:24.013
Take it easy there.

48:25.307 --> 48:27.308
Well, did you hurt yourself?

48:32.814 --> 48:35.066
- Careful next time.
- Here's another one.

48:38.987 --> 48:40.863
How do you do?

48:48.747 --> 48:52.416
Something's happened. I know it.
The storm troopers, they helped me up.

48:53.460 --> 48:55.878
Wouldn't it be wonderful
if they stopped hating us...

48:55.963 --> 48:59.590
if they'd leave us alone and let us
go about our business like we used to.

48:59.675 --> 49:03.177
Wouldn't it be wonderful if we didn't
have to leave and go to another country?

49:03.262 --> 49:08.307
I don't want to go away. With all the hardship
and the persecution, I love it here.

49:08.392 --> 49:10.977
Perhaps we don't have to go.

49:11.061 --> 49:14.897
Wouldn't it be wonderful
if they'd let us live and be happy again?

49:51.977 --> 49:53.894
Period.

49:58.734 --> 50:00.234
<i>Danke schoen.</i>

50:23.425 --> 50:26.052
Nothing works! Not a decent pen!
Not even a sharp pencil!

50:26.136 --> 50:29.638
I'm surrounded by nothing but incompetent,
stupid, sterile stenographers!

50:29.723 --> 50:32.224
- I'll get you a pen.
- Don't bother.

50:32.309 --> 50:34.226
I won't send it.

50:34.311 --> 50:36.312
Get out! Get out! Get out!

50:41.610 --> 50:46.113
We've just discovered the most wonderful,
the most marvelous poison gas!

50:47.532 --> 50:50.034
It will kill everybody!

50:50.118 --> 50:52.370
All right, later, later, later.

50:52.454 --> 50:54.372
<i>B-76 to see Herr Herring.</i>

50:54.456 --> 50:55.873
- Who's that?
- A lady.

50:55.957 --> 50:58.167
My secret agent.

50:58.251 --> 51:00.711
Your secret agent.
Tell her to come here.

51:00.796 --> 51:02.421
Have B-76 come right in.

51:03.423 --> 51:04.840
Hail Hynkel.

51:04.925 --> 51:07.343
- Oh, Garbitsch, what do you hear from Epstein?
- Most encouraging.

51:07.427 --> 51:11.806
Our agent reports that all the board of directors
are Aryans, so the loan is bound to go through.

51:11.890 --> 51:14.266
- Good.
- Hail Hynkel.

51:16.978 --> 51:18.479
Come here.

51:21.274 --> 51:23.901
- Well?
- The men are planning a strike at the arms factory.

51:23.985 --> 51:26.320
- Who's the leader?
- There were five of them.

51:26.405 --> 51:29.573
- Have them shot.
- They were, Your Excellency.

51:32.327 --> 51:35.830
- How many do you say were going on strike?
- The whole factory - 3,000 of them.

51:35.914 --> 51:39.041
Have them all shot. I don't want
any of my workers dissatisfied.

51:39.126 --> 51:41.293
But, Your Excellency,
these men are skilled craftsmen.

51:41.378 --> 51:44.338
Why not let them work till
they can train others, then shoot them?

51:44.423 --> 51:46.090
We cannot afford to be lenient!

51:46.174 --> 51:48.717
The whole rhythm of production
will be affected if you shoot them now.

51:48.802 --> 51:51.554
"Rhythm of production. "
All right, have your rhythms.

51:51.638 --> 51:55.516
You may instruct your operatives to spare
the strikers and permit them to return to work...

51:55.600 --> 51:57.685
but to mark them
for future reference.

51:58.687 --> 52:00.479
That is my department.
I'll attend to that.

52:00.564 --> 52:02.189
This way, madam.

52:06.945 --> 52:10.698
Strange. These strike leaders - they're
all brunettes. Not a blonde amongst them.

52:10.782 --> 52:12.741
Brunettes are troublemakers.
They're worse than the Jews.

52:12.826 --> 52:14.285
Then wipe them out.

52:14.369 --> 52:16.662
<i>Doucement.
Not so fast.</i>

52:16.746 --> 52:19.540
We get rid of the Jews first.
Then concentrate on the brunettes.

52:19.624 --> 52:23.085
We shall never have peace
until we have a pure Aryan race.

52:23.170 --> 52:24.462
How wonderful.

52:24.546 --> 52:27.465
Tomainia, a nation
of blue-eyed blondes.

52:27.549 --> 52:30.176
Why not a blonde Europe,
a blonde Asia, a blonde America?

52:30.260 --> 52:32.178
- A blonde world.
- And a brunette dictator.

52:32.262 --> 52:33.471
Dictator of the world.

52:33.555 --> 52:35.181
Why not?

52:35.265 --> 52:37.016
<i>Aut Caesar aut nulles.</i>

52:37.100 --> 52:39.393
The world is effete, worn-out, afraid.

52:39.478 --> 52:41.604
No nation would dare to oppose you.

52:41.688 --> 52:44.148
- Dictator of the world!
- It's your destiny.

52:44.232 --> 52:47.318
We'll kill off the Jews,
wipe out the brunettes.

52:47.402 --> 52:50.488
Then will come forth our dream -
a pure Aryan race.

52:50.572 --> 52:53.616
- Beautiful blonde Aryans.
- They will love you. They will adore you.

52:53.700 --> 52:56.952
- They will worship you as a god!
- No, no! You mustn't say it!

53:01.249 --> 53:03.250
You make me afraid of myself.

53:11.551 --> 53:13.761
Yes, dictator of the world.

53:13.845 --> 53:15.763
We'll start
with the invasion of Osterlich.

53:15.847 --> 53:17.765
After that we won't have to fight.
We can bluff.

53:17.849 --> 53:19.767
Nation after nation will capitulate.

53:19.851 --> 53:22.686
Within two years
the world will be under your thumb!

53:22.771 --> 53:26.065
Leave me.
I want to be alone.

53:56.471 --> 53:59.890
<i>Aut Caesar aut nulles.</i>

53:59.975 --> 54:02.560
Emperor of the world!

54:05.647 --> 54:08.065
My world.

55:59.594 --> 56:02.012
<i>This is the Happy Hour program.</i>

56:02.097 --> 56:05.015
<i>Make your work a pleasure.
Move with the rhythm of music.</i>

56:05.100 --> 56:08.060
<i>Our next selection:
Brahms' "Hungarian Dance No. 5."</i>

57:57.045 --> 57:58.754
Fifteen cents, please.

58:06.387 --> 58:08.639
<i>The Happy Hour program now signing off.</i>

58:08.723 --> 58:11.475
<i>At 6:00 all stations will carry
Adenoid Hynkel's address...</i>

58:11.559 --> 58:13.977
<i>to the sons and daughters
of the Double Cross.</i>

58:14.062 --> 58:16.313
Seems like the old days again,
don't it?

58:16.397 --> 58:18.649
I wonder how long
they are going to last.

58:18.733 --> 58:20.317
Don't you read the papers?

58:20.401 --> 58:23.487
It is rumored that Hynkel is going to
give the Jewish people back their rights.

58:23.571 --> 58:25.239
Hmm. Maybe.

58:25.323 --> 58:26.824
What do you want?

58:26.908 --> 58:30.577
Business is much better.
Nobody interferes with us anymore.

58:30.662 --> 58:32.871
Now don't that make you feel good?

58:32.956 --> 58:34.540
No, sir.

58:34.624 --> 58:39.086
The trouble, Mr. Jaeckel, is, you're so used
to bad times you're unhappy without them.

58:39.170 --> 58:42.297
Mary? Mary!
Get my Sunday shoes.

58:42.382 --> 58:45.175
- You'll find them on the window sill.
- All right.

58:45.260 --> 58:48.345
- I can't find the shawl.
- Don't bother. I've got the shawl.

58:48.429 --> 58:50.931
- What's going on upstairs?
- It's Hannah.

58:51.015 --> 58:53.267
They're dressing her up
to go out this evening.

58:53.351 --> 58:56.270
- Is that so?
- She's got a beau.

58:56.354 --> 58:58.480
- Who is it?
- The barber.

58:59.274 --> 59:01.441
Now turn around.

59:03.152 --> 59:05.112
Oh, my dear, those hands.

59:05.196 --> 59:08.782
- What's the matter with them?
- Those calluses - they're so rough.

59:08.867 --> 59:11.660
- Maybe I'd better not go.
- Don't be foolish.

59:11.744 --> 59:13.745
He knows you do housework.

59:13.830 --> 59:16.832
Wait a minute.
I'll get a pair of mittens from Mrs. Morris.

59:16.916 --> 59:20.544
- Mrs. Morris?
- Yes, Mrs. Jaeckel? Come in!

59:20.628 --> 59:23.088
Aggie.

59:23.172 --> 59:25.465
- Yeah?
- See if he's ready yet.

59:25.550 --> 59:27.801
All right.

59:39.981 --> 59:43.317
Not yet.
He's polishing a bald man's head.

59:50.241 --> 59:51.825
Bad news.

59:51.910 --> 59:53.952
The invasion of Osterlich
will have to be delayed.

59:54.037 --> 59:57.289
- What?
- Epstein refuses to lend us the money.

59:59.417 --> 01:00:01.376
Epstein refuses, huh?

01:00:05.715 --> 01:00:07.174
Send for Schultz!

01:00:08.259 --> 01:00:09.676
Commander Schultz.

01:00:09.761 --> 01:00:11.678
Epstein refuses!

01:00:14.766 --> 01:00:17.476
That contemptible Epstein!
What did he say?

01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:19.686
He complained
of the persecution of his people...

01:00:19.771 --> 01:00:23.690
and said under no circumstances would he
have any dealings with a medieval maniac.

01:00:23.775 --> 01:00:27.110
He'll deal with a medieval maniac
more than he thinks!

01:00:30.031 --> 01:00:32.699
First I shall deal with "his people. "

01:00:32.784 --> 01:00:34.326
Your Excellency?

01:00:34.410 --> 01:00:36.536
Schultz, call out the storm troopers.

01:00:36.621 --> 01:00:39.790
We're going to stage
a little medieval entertainment in the ghetto.

01:00:39.874 --> 01:00:42.876
At such a time, Your Excellency,
I think it's ill-advised.

01:00:42.961 --> 01:00:44.211
What?

01:00:44.295 --> 01:00:46.797
Demonstrations of this kind
are demoralizing the whole country.

01:00:46.881 --> 01:00:48.548
Indeed.

01:00:49.717 --> 01:00:52.636
And since when have you been
so concerned about the ghetto?

01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:56.014
I speak in the interests of our party
and for the cause of humanity.

01:00:57.892 --> 01:00:59.184
Schultz.

01:00:59.268 --> 01:01:01.144
You need a vacation.

01:01:02.230 --> 01:01:03.730
Fresh air.

01:01:06.275 --> 01:01:08.777
A little outdoor exercise.

01:01:10.071 --> 01:01:12.698
I shall send you
to a concentration camp.

01:01:13.574 --> 01:01:14.908
Guards!

01:01:15.702 --> 01:01:17.619
Place Commander Schultz under arrest.

01:01:17.704 --> 01:01:19.913
Very well,
but remember my words.

01:01:19.998 --> 01:01:24.835
Your cause is doomed to failure because it's built on
the stupid, ruthless persecution of innocent people.

01:01:24.919 --> 01:01:26.837
Your policy is worse than a crime.

01:01:26.921 --> 01:01:29.089
It's a tragic blunder.

01:01:29.173 --> 01:01:31.425
Traitor! Traitor!

01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:35.095
You're nothing
but a double-dyed democrat!

01:01:57.785 --> 01:02:01.288
Schultz, why have you forsaken me?

01:02:13.843 --> 01:02:16.928
Excellency, here are the notes
for your speech.

01:02:17.013 --> 01:02:18.680
Thank you.

01:02:29.734 --> 01:02:31.568
I'll not need them.

01:02:31.652 --> 01:02:35.530
What I say tonight will not be directed
to the sons and daughters of the Double Cross...

01:02:35.615 --> 01:02:39.409
but to the children of Israel.

01:03:10.525 --> 01:03:13.276
- Ah. Good evening.
- Good evening.

01:03:15.363 --> 01:03:16.905
Good night.

01:03:16.989 --> 01:03:18.490
Good night.

01:03:31.337 --> 01:03:34.714
Do you know, that Hynkel
isn't such a bad fella after all.

01:03:34.799 --> 01:03:36.591
Most amusing.

01:03:36.676 --> 01:03:38.802
Here you are.
Get a Hynkel button. Get a Hynkel button.

01:03:38.886 --> 01:03:41.179
A fine photo of the Phooey
on each and every button.

01:03:41.264 --> 01:03:43.515
<i>Two? Here you are, young man.</i>

01:03:43.599 --> 01:03:45.684
<i>... the double-crossin'!</i>

01:03:45.768 --> 01:03:48.228
But the Juden! The Juden!

01:04:11.169 --> 01:04:12.919
<i>...und the ghetto...</i>

01:04:13.004 --> 01:04:15.172
<i>The ghetto -</i>

01:04:29.353 --> 01:04:31.396
- We'd better go home.
- Yeah.

01:04:32.273 --> 01:04:33.815
Come on, let's hurry.

01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:35.442
Wait a minute. No!

01:04:40.364 --> 01:04:45.118
<i>...the Juden. The Juden -</i>

01:05:10.061 --> 01:05:13.980
<i>The Juden! The Juden!</i>

01:05:14.065 --> 01:05:16.066
<i>Hey.</i>

01:05:26.327 --> 01:05:28.245
What's that?

01:05:28.329 --> 01:05:30.330
Turn off the radio!

01:05:33.501 --> 01:05:34.459
Listen!

01:05:34.543 --> 01:05:36.836
# The Aryan, the Aryan #

01:05:36.921 --> 01:05:38.588
It's the storm troopers!

01:05:38.673 --> 01:05:40.715
No, no!

01:05:45.429 --> 01:05:48.848
<i># The Ary-Ary-Ary-Ary-Aryan #</i>

01:05:48.933 --> 01:05:50.642
Oh, come on! Get in!

01:05:50.726 --> 01:05:52.769
Come on! Come on! Get in!

01:05:52.853 --> 01:05:54.938
<i># The Ary-Ary-Ary-Ary-Aryan #</i>

01:05:55.022 --> 01:05:56.606
- Bar that door!
- Get some water!

01:05:56.691 --> 01:05:59.609
Mr. Jaeckel.
Mr. Jaeckel, Mr. Jaeckel, Mr. Jaeckel!

01:05:59.694 --> 01:06:01.945
Oh, my dear!

01:06:02.029 --> 01:06:03.280
What is it, dear?

01:06:03.364 --> 01:06:06.950
Mother, get the women and children up here.
Lock all the doors.

01:06:09.954 --> 01:06:12.539
Here. You men, stay right here.

01:06:12.623 --> 01:06:14.708
We've got to make a stand.

01:06:14.792 --> 01:06:18.336
We might as well die
as to go on living like this.

01:06:18.421 --> 01:06:20.797
<i># The Ary-Ary-Ary-Ary-Aryan #</i>

01:06:24.468 --> 01:06:28.138
Wait a minute!
We have a social call to make here!

01:06:36.188 --> 01:06:37.689
It's Hynkel!

01:06:39.233 --> 01:06:40.734
Wait a minute!

01:06:42.945 --> 01:06:44.446
What do you think you're doing?

01:06:44.530 --> 01:06:47.240
Commander Schultz gave strict orders
not to molest anyone in this court.

01:06:47.325 --> 01:06:49.034
These Jews were attacking storm troopers.

01:06:49.118 --> 01:06:51.536
I don't care what they were doing.
The orders were to keep out of here.

01:06:53.497 --> 01:06:55.832
There! You saw that for yourself!

01:06:55.916 --> 01:06:58.335
I can't help it.
Those are Commander Schultz's orders.

01:06:58.419 --> 01:06:59.919
Come on. Let's get going.

01:07:00.004 --> 01:07:01.504
Come on.

01:07:06.844 --> 01:07:10.597
<i># Aryan #</i>

01:07:10.681 --> 01:07:13.600
<i># The Ary-Ary-Ary-Ary-Aryan ##</i>

01:07:18.564 --> 01:07:21.274
Orders or no orders,
I'm gonna get that girl.

01:07:23.235 --> 01:07:28.323
Out.

01:07:28.407 --> 01:07:29.908
<i>Aww.</i>

01:07:41.045 --> 01:07:43.046
Extry! Paper!

01:07:43.130 --> 01:07:46.132
- Schultz arrested! Paper!
- Did you hear that?

01:07:46.217 --> 01:07:48.134
- He's arrested Commander Schultz.
- What?

01:07:48.219 --> 01:07:49.886
Commander Schultz
has been arrested!

01:07:49.970 --> 01:07:52.013
- TTroopers!
- Listen.

01:07:52.098 --> 01:07:55.350
- A Jew corrupted our commander!
- Let's kill the lot of them!

01:07:56.477 --> 01:07:58.728
Commander Schultz
is under arrest, accused of treason!

01:07:58.813 --> 01:08:03.400
And you know why. Schultz was a friend
of the ghetto, a friend of that barber!

01:08:03.484 --> 01:08:06.778
- Let's get the barber!
- We want the barber!

01:08:06.862 --> 01:08:08.405
We want the barber!

01:08:08.489 --> 01:08:10.365
- It's the storm troopers! They're after you!
- We want the barber!

01:08:10.449 --> 01:08:12.617
- You better get up on the roof.
- No. I'll stay here.

01:08:12.701 --> 01:08:14.202
Come on! They'll kill you!

01:08:14.286 --> 01:08:16.621
- No, I'll stay and fight!
- Don't be a fool!

01:08:16.705 --> 01:08:18.997
Do you want to be murdered?
Get on to the roof. Quick!

01:08:19.082 --> 01:08:21.917
- Come on! Come on!
- Agar, get inside.

01:08:22.002 --> 01:08:25.505
We want the barber!
We want the barber!

01:08:25.589 --> 01:08:27.173
We want the barber!

01:08:27.258 --> 01:08:30.343
All right, here we are!
Smash in the door! Come on!

01:08:32.263 --> 01:08:33.595
Come on, boys!

01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:36.224
Come on, boys!
We'll give the barber a haircut!

01:08:41.729 --> 01:08:44.149
- All right, where are the bombs?
- Come on. This way!

01:08:44.233 --> 01:08:45.859
Let 'er go!

01:08:47.987 --> 01:08:53.158
# Aryan, the Ary-Ary-Ary-Ary-Aryan #

01:09:02.334 --> 01:09:04.210
There goes the barbershop.

01:09:07.131 --> 01:09:09.299
Never mind. We can start again.

01:09:09.383 --> 01:09:12.635
We can go to Osterlich.
That's still a free country.

01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:15.054
Mr. Jaeckel says it's beautiful there.

01:09:15.139 --> 01:09:18.224
Wonderful green fields,
and they grow apples and grapes.

01:09:19.018 --> 01:09:21.560
Mr. Jaeckel's brother's got a vineyard
in Osterlich.

01:09:21.645 --> 01:09:25.106
And when Mr. Jaeckel goes there,
he said he'd take me with him.

01:09:25.191 --> 01:09:27.108
Now we can all go together.

01:09:27.943 --> 01:09:30.904
It'll be wonderful living in the country.

01:09:30.988 --> 01:09:33.948
Much better than a smoky old city.

01:09:34.658 --> 01:09:38.077
And if we work hard and don't eat much,
we can save money.

01:09:38.996 --> 01:09:41.247
We can buy a chicken farm.

01:09:42.457 --> 01:09:44.584
There's nice money
to be made in chickens.

01:10:07.483 --> 01:10:09.275
Look at that star.

01:10:11.195 --> 01:10:13.154
Isn't it beautiful?

01:10:16.617 --> 01:10:20.286
One thing - Hynkel with all his power
can never touch that.

01:10:22.957 --> 01:10:25.959
It's all right now.
The coast is clear. Listen.

01:10:26.043 --> 01:10:28.336
Commander Schultz escaped.
He's hiding in my cellar.

01:10:28.420 --> 01:10:29.379
What?

01:10:29.463 --> 01:10:33.049
He's holding a meeting at midnight
and he wants you to be there.

01:10:33.133 --> 01:10:34.884
Hannah, you too come down...

01:10:34.969 --> 01:10:36.719
and help Mrs. Jaeckel with the supper.

01:10:36.804 --> 01:10:38.304
All right. I'll be down.

01:10:42.977 --> 01:10:44.811
I don't understand it.

01:10:44.895 --> 01:10:47.480
This crazy midnight supper.

01:10:47.565 --> 01:10:50.400
What does this Commander Schultz
want of us?

01:10:50.484 --> 01:10:52.569
He wants us to blow up the palace.

01:10:52.653 --> 01:10:54.320
What?

01:10:54.405 --> 01:10:57.824
We Jewish people shouldn't
get mixed up in such a business.

01:10:57.908 --> 01:11:01.536
I know it, but Commander Schultz is such
a good talker, he has them all hypnotized.

01:11:01.620 --> 01:11:03.788
I knew he was up to some mischief.

01:11:03.872 --> 01:11:05.498
Sure, he is!

01:11:06.584 --> 01:11:08.209
I came in the kitchen this evening...

01:11:08.294 --> 01:11:11.004
and found him putting a coin
in one of your puddings.

01:11:11.088 --> 01:11:13.548
Putting a coin in one of the puddings?

01:11:13.632 --> 01:11:17.302
But don't worry. I've fixed everything.
Wait and see.

01:11:17.386 --> 01:11:22.098
Gentlemen, may I claim
your indulgence for a moment?

01:11:22.182 --> 01:11:26.603
We are here tonight
to rid the country of a tyrant.

01:11:27.438 --> 01:11:30.231
In order to carry out this plan,
one of us must die.

01:11:33.319 --> 01:11:36.696
In ancient times,
the Aryan tribe of Langobardians...

01:11:36.780 --> 01:11:39.657
made human sacrifice to the god Thor.

01:11:41.035 --> 01:11:43.953
At a feast by lottery
the victim was chosen.

01:11:44.038 --> 01:11:47.624
Tonight at this feast
one of you will be chosen.

01:11:51.629 --> 01:11:53.713
Each man will receive a pudding.

01:11:53.797 --> 01:11:56.257
Concealed in one of these is a coin.

01:11:56.342 --> 01:11:59.594
Whoever gets that coin must give up his life
for the liberation of his people.

01:11:59.678 --> 01:12:04.390
But he will join the long line
of history's noble martyrs...

01:12:04.475 --> 01:12:08.227
and will rid his country of a tyrant.

01:12:11.398 --> 01:12:12.398
Ooh!

01:12:19.281 --> 01:12:21.908
I know that it is the wish
of all of us...

01:12:21.992 --> 01:12:24.827
to be chosen this night
to die for Tomainia.

01:12:25.663 --> 01:12:28.581
Much as I should like
to participate in this ordeal...

01:12:28.666 --> 01:12:30.166
I cannot.

01:12:30.250 --> 01:12:31.751
Why?

01:12:34.797 --> 01:12:37.674
Don't you understand?
He's too well-known.

01:12:37.758 --> 01:12:40.426
It must be done by somebody like us.

01:12:40.511 --> 01:12:42.261
I can't see it like that.

01:12:42.346 --> 01:12:46.182
Gentlemen, if this is a question of my honor,
it's very embarrassing.

01:12:47.851 --> 01:12:51.145
Commander Schultz,
I apologize for my friend.

01:12:51.230 --> 01:12:54.607
And let me say on behalf
of myself and the others...

01:12:54.692 --> 01:12:58.528
that we consider it a great privilege
to die for our country.

01:12:59.530 --> 01:13:04.742
Very well then. Gentlemen, I shall now retire
until fate has chosen the liberator.

01:13:08.205 --> 01:13:10.623
Until then, hail Hynk -

01:13:10.708 --> 01:13:13.042
Oh, what am I saying?

01:13:13.127 --> 01:13:17.964
Gentlemen, we have pledged our honor.

01:13:18.048 --> 01:13:19.257
Proceed.

01:16:25.569 --> 01:16:28.237
Gentlemen, the coin is here.

01:16:34.661 --> 01:16:36.412
What's the meaning of all this?

01:16:36.496 --> 01:16:37.997
Somebody made a fool of us.

01:16:38.081 --> 01:16:40.166
- You're quite right. I did.
- What?

01:16:40.250 --> 01:16:42.293
I put a coin in every pudding.

01:16:45.422 --> 01:16:47.256
Mr. Jaeckel!

01:16:47.341 --> 01:16:52.303
Blowing up palaces and wanting to kill people.
We're in enough trouble as it is.

01:16:53.597 --> 01:16:57.099
Hannah's right.
We've all been foolish.

01:16:57.184 --> 01:17:00.686
Our place is at home,
looking after our own affairs.

01:17:00.771 --> 01:17:02.647
Good night.

01:17:02.731 --> 01:17:04.231
What's this?

01:17:04.316 --> 01:17:05.816
Good night.

01:17:10.447 --> 01:17:12.448
Good morning.

01:17:24.127 --> 01:17:27.046
By the papers they are saying Commander
Schultz may be hiding in the ghetto.

01:17:27.130 --> 01:17:29.465
Here it is. Read it for yourself.

01:17:30.634 --> 01:17:32.635
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:17:32.719 --> 01:17:34.845
Hannah, here. Read that.

01:17:34.930 --> 01:17:36.722
"Mystery still surrounds
the disappearance...

01:17:36.807 --> 01:17:38.057
of ex-Commander Schultz.

01:17:38.141 --> 01:17:41.686
At police headquarters it was believed that
the commander may be hiding in the ghetto.

01:17:41.770 --> 01:17:45.690
A certain Jewish barber,
reported to be a friend of Schultz...

01:17:45.774 --> 01:17:47.650
is also wanted for questioning. "

01:17:47.734 --> 01:17:48.734
Me?

01:17:48.819 --> 01:17:51.320
Well, if it's just for questioning,
it can't be serious.

01:17:51.405 --> 01:17:55.491
Meyerberg was only wanted for questioning,
and we never heard of him since.

01:17:55.575 --> 01:17:57.410
Shh!

01:18:06.169 --> 01:18:08.254
- Who is it?
- It's me - Mr. Mann.

01:18:11.758 --> 01:18:14.218
Hello, Jaeckel. How are you, Mr. Agar?

01:18:14.302 --> 01:18:16.595
- How are you, Mrs. Jaeckel?
- How do you do?

01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:18.514
Did you hear
what they're saying in the papers...

01:18:18.598 --> 01:18:20.266
about Commander Schultz
hiding in the ghetto?

01:18:20.350 --> 01:18:21.851
Oh, I know, I know.

01:18:21.935 --> 01:18:25.521
Well, don't you think that it's serious for you
if they find him here in the house?

01:18:25.605 --> 01:18:27.231
Shh!

01:18:27.315 --> 01:18:29.984
Don't you realize
there are spies everywhere?

01:18:30.068 --> 01:18:32.153
Spies?

01:18:33.864 --> 01:18:37.491
What's the matter with him?

01:18:37.576 --> 01:18:40.161
Didn't you read
he's wanted for questioning?

01:18:40.245 --> 01:18:42.079
Oy.

01:18:42.164 --> 01:18:43.497
Where's the commander?

01:18:43.582 --> 01:18:45.875
He's in the next room.

01:18:45.959 --> 01:18:47.460
Let me tell you.

01:18:47.544 --> 01:18:49.420
If Commander Schultz is found
in this house...

01:18:49.504 --> 01:18:54.091
we'll all go to the concentration camp for life
and get our heads cut off in the bargain.

01:18:54.176 --> 01:18:56.093
Am I giving you an argument?

01:18:56.178 --> 01:18:57.720
Then get rid of him.

01:18:57.804 --> 01:18:59.513
You can't throw him out.

01:18:59.598 --> 01:19:01.140
Of course not.

01:19:01.224 --> 01:19:04.977
But I should like to know,
how long is he going to stay here?

01:19:05.062 --> 01:19:06.145
That's all.

01:19:06.229 --> 01:19:08.647
Come. Your breakfast is on the table.

01:19:08.732 --> 01:19:11.484
- Mr. Mann?
- Thank you.

01:19:11.568 --> 01:19:13.402
I have breakfast waiting at home.

01:19:14.988 --> 01:19:17.281
Take the other side of the street
and search every house.

01:19:20.327 --> 01:19:21.869
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:19:21.953 --> 01:19:24.163
- What's wrong now?
- They're looking for Commander Schultz.

01:19:24.247 --> 01:19:27.166
- Commander Schultz?
- He's supposed to be hiding in one of those houses.

01:19:27.250 --> 01:19:29.585
Oh, they're always looking
for somebody.

01:19:42.682 --> 01:19:45.101
- Who is it?
- It's me. Let me in!

01:19:45.185 --> 01:19:47.561
- For heaven's sake, hurry up!
- Open the door.

01:19:52.109 --> 01:19:53.609
- They're coming this way.
- What?

01:19:53.693 --> 01:19:56.195
The storm troopers are searching
every house.

01:19:56.279 --> 01:19:57.863
Quick! Tell the commander.

01:20:05.038 --> 01:20:06.539
- Did you tell him?
- Yes.

01:20:06.623 --> 01:20:09.041
- What is it?
- The storm troopers, they're going to search the house.

01:20:09.126 --> 01:20:12.044
- What?
- You'd better get up on the roof. Quick! Both of you!

01:20:13.505 --> 01:20:14.797
Wait a minute!

01:20:14.881 --> 01:20:18.217
- We can't leave all these things about.
- That's right. All of you, pack my valises.

01:20:20.137 --> 01:20:21.846
You pack this valise.

01:20:30.564 --> 01:20:32.731
- Clear this shelf. Quickly.
- Oh, yes.

01:20:35.318 --> 01:20:37.403
Pack this and this.

01:20:37.487 --> 01:20:40.406
Oh, this mustn't be found here.
Open the door.

01:20:46.580 --> 01:20:49.665
Listen! They are here!
Get up on the roof. Quick!

01:20:49.749 --> 01:20:52.501
- I'll take this.
- Be sure they don't leave anything behind.

01:20:52.586 --> 01:20:54.587
- My golf clubs.
- The hatbox!

01:20:57.757 --> 01:21:00.009
- Here. Take this.
- Come on! Let's hurry!

01:21:00.093 --> 01:21:01.677
- Where are you going?
- I'm going with him.

01:21:01.761 --> 01:21:03.554
You stay here. You'll see him later.
Here. Take this.

01:21:03.638 --> 01:21:05.514
- I'll meet you on the roof tonight.
- All right.

01:21:05.599 --> 01:21:07.099
Oh, take this.

01:21:11.354 --> 01:21:13.272
Come on. Quick! Come on.

01:21:13.356 --> 01:21:16.358
Open in the name of Hynkel!

01:21:23.074 --> 01:21:25.075
Stop!

01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:27.286
- Look where you are.
- Look where?

01:21:27.370 --> 01:21:28.996
Look where you are.

01:21:29.080 --> 01:21:31.207
Wait, I can't - I can't see.
Wait a moment.

01:21:31.875 --> 01:21:35.878
- My bag! You've dropped it!
- No, it's right here. Here it is.

01:21:42.844 --> 01:21:45.554
Don't drop the other one!
Don't drop the other one!

01:21:45.639 --> 01:21:48.974
My golf clubs! Not my golf clubs!

01:21:49.643 --> 01:21:51.602
Come off of there. They'll see you.

01:21:52.979 --> 01:21:55.314
Quick! This way!

01:22:00.695 --> 01:22:02.821
Whoa! Steady!

01:22:02.906 --> 01:22:04.865
Now be careful.

01:22:04.950 --> 01:22:06.283
Yes, sir.

01:22:06.368 --> 01:22:08.410
You were lucky
you didn't break your neck.

01:22:08.495 --> 01:22:09.828
Yes, sir.

01:22:14.167 --> 01:22:15.668
You'll pardon me.

01:22:18.755 --> 01:22:19.838
Sorry.

01:22:22.175 --> 01:22:24.802
You guard the back -
Wait a minute.

01:22:24.886 --> 01:22:26.845
I'm sorry.
I shall have to bother you again.

01:22:28.098 --> 01:22:29.598
There he is!

01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:35.813
Well, good morning. How are you?

01:22:35.897 --> 01:22:37.690
Oh, so-so.

01:22:37.774 --> 01:22:39.566
Commander Schultz, who's your friend?

01:22:39.651 --> 01:22:41.944
Remember, your silence
will be appreciated.

01:22:42.028 --> 01:22:43.696
- Yes, sir.
- Take him down to the wagon.

01:22:43.780 --> 01:22:44.947
Come on.

01:22:57.794 --> 01:23:00.129
- Hey! Where you going?
- To the smoking room.

01:23:00.213 --> 01:23:02.381
Ah, come on! Down this way!

01:23:51.848 --> 01:23:53.349
Osterlich.

01:23:53.433 --> 01:23:54.433
<i>Ja.</i>

01:25:27.527 --> 01:25:29.194
Gentlemen, I am pleased to announce...

01:25:29.279 --> 01:25:32.781
that we are at last
ready to march on Osterlich.

01:25:32.866 --> 01:25:35.617
This was made possible
by the enterprise and genius...

01:25:35.702 --> 01:25:37.703
of Field Marshal Herring...

01:25:37.787 --> 01:25:40.622
upon whom I shall now pin
a token of my regard.

01:25:45.628 --> 01:25:50.549
<i>...der Wiener schnitzel -</i>

01:25:57.140 --> 01:26:00.058
...da genius.

01:26:05.398 --> 01:26:08.400
Turn around. No. Ah, yes.

01:26:21.164 --> 01:26:22.664
Gentlemen...

01:26:24.334 --> 01:26:26.919
to Field Marshal Herring.

01:26:27.003 --> 01:26:28.921
To the invasion of Osterlich.

01:26:45.688 --> 01:26:46.688
Elephant.

01:26:48.942 --> 01:26:52.194
Hello? Yes. Yes.

01:26:52.278 --> 01:26:53.278
Wait.

01:26:53.363 --> 01:26:55.614
Napaloni's mobilized his army
on the Osterlich front.

01:26:55.698 --> 01:26:57.115
What?

01:26:57.200 --> 01:26:59.618
Already 60,000 men are on the border.

01:26:59.702 --> 01:27:01.203
He's going to take Osterlich!

01:27:01.287 --> 01:27:03.080
I can't believe it.

01:27:05.124 --> 01:27:07.751
You can't believe it?

01:27:07.835 --> 01:27:10.462
But, Your Excellency, I -

01:27:10.547 --> 01:27:12.506
- You let him steal a march on us!
- No, I -

01:27:12.590 --> 01:27:15.092
You can't believe it?

01:27:15.176 --> 01:27:19.638
I did everything that was -

01:27:19.722 --> 01:27:23.475
I had the ground covered.

01:27:31.150 --> 01:27:33.318
Haven't you any brains?

01:27:33.403 --> 01:27:35.320
<i>..."pinheaden"...</i>

01:27:45.582 --> 01:27:47.249
No! No, no, no, no, no!

01:27:47.333 --> 01:27:49.501
No, no, no, no, no!

01:27:50.587 --> 01:27:52.921
No, no - No!

01:27:53.006 --> 01:27:55.340
- Declare war on Napaloni!
- Napaloni?

01:27:55.425 --> 01:27:59.761
Yes, Napaloni! Listen, you blockhead! Mobilize
every division of the army and the air force.

01:27:59.846 --> 01:28:02.764
- Proceed to Bacteria and attack at once!
- But war will be the end of us.

01:28:02.849 --> 01:28:04.016
- Do as I tell you.
- Madness.

01:28:04.100 --> 01:28:05.851
- Shut up!
- Very well. Will you sign this?

01:28:05.935 --> 01:28:08.186
- Yes, I'll - What is it?
- A declaration of war.

01:28:08.271 --> 01:28:09.938
I'll sign it. A pen.

01:28:10.023 --> 01:28:12.441
I'll sign it.

01:28:18.364 --> 01:28:19.615
A pen!

01:28:19.699 --> 01:28:21.867
I'll sign it! Napaloni.

01:28:21.951 --> 01:28:24.703
<i>Der grosser peanut!
Der cheesy ravioli!</i>

01:28:24.787 --> 01:28:26.330
There!

01:28:26.414 --> 01:28:28.081
Hello?

01:28:28.166 --> 01:28:30.208
- It's Napaloni.
- Wait a minute.

01:28:30.293 --> 01:28:32.210
Napaloni?

01:28:32.295 --> 01:28:34.963
- You talk to him.
- What shall I say?

01:28:35.048 --> 01:28:37.633
Be nice, affable, pleasant.

01:28:40.762 --> 01:28:41.803
Hello?

01:28:41.888 --> 01:28:44.306
Well, well, well. How are you?

01:28:44.390 --> 01:28:46.183
Fine.

01:28:46.267 --> 01:28:49.061
No, he hasn't been playing
very much lately.

01:28:49.145 --> 01:28:51.480
You went around in '92? Really?

01:28:53.399 --> 01:28:55.525
You want to speak to His Excellency?

01:29:00.406 --> 01:29:02.491
Just now he's a little hoarse.

01:29:02.575 --> 01:29:06.870
Hmm. No, no. I mean he can't talk.

01:29:06.954 --> 01:29:09.122
May I take a message?

01:29:09.874 --> 01:29:13.085
He says no doubt you've heard of the movement
of his troops on the Osterlich front...

01:29:13.169 --> 01:29:14.670
and he'd like to discuss
the matter with you.

01:29:14.754 --> 01:29:16.463
Ask him to come here.

01:29:16.547 --> 01:29:18.840
His Excellency would be delighted
to invite you to Tomainia...

01:29:18.925 --> 01:29:20.717
where you could discuss the matter.

01:29:21.844 --> 01:29:24.513
Very well.
I'll make the necessary arrangements.

01:29:24.597 --> 01:29:26.515
Good-bye, Your Excellency.

01:29:26.599 --> 01:29:27.849
He's coming.

01:29:27.934 --> 01:29:30.352
Good. We'll give him the works.

01:29:30.436 --> 01:29:32.771
We'll put on the greatest military show
the world has ever known!

01:29:32.855 --> 01:29:37.067
Convinced of my strength, Napaloni will
leave the invasion of Osterlich to me.

01:29:38.528 --> 01:29:40.028
What shall I do with this?

01:29:40.113 --> 01:29:42.322
- What is it?
- Your declaration of war.

01:29:45.493 --> 01:29:47.619
Peace is declared.

01:29:50.039 --> 01:29:54.459
<i>2,975,000 eager citizens
are massed in the station square...</i>

01:29:54.544 --> 01:29:57.129
<i>awaiting the arrival
of Benzine Napaloni.</i>

01:29:57.213 --> 01:30:01.299
<i>Entering the station is our beloved Phooey,
ready to greet his distinguished guest.</i>

01:30:01.384 --> 01:30:03.468
<i>This historic meeting
will cement a friendship...</i>

01:30:03.553 --> 01:30:07.556
<i>that has long existed between our Phooey
and the dictator of Bacteria.</i>

01:30:07.640 --> 01:30:08.974
Order... arms!

01:30:09.058 --> 01:30:12.477
<i>His Excellency is about to greet
the Bacterian ambassador.</i>

01:30:12.562 --> 01:30:14.646
- How do you do?
- Thank you, sir.

01:30:15.815 --> 01:30:17.065
Garbitsch.

01:30:18.901 --> 01:30:20.652
See about the photography.

01:30:22.321 --> 01:30:23.905
When Their Excellencies meet...

01:30:23.990 --> 01:30:26.283
tell the press to see that our Phooey
is well-photographed.

01:30:26.367 --> 01:30:28.160
- Full face, not the back of his head.
- Yes, sir.

01:30:28.244 --> 01:30:31.496
<i>Benzino Napaloni's private train
is now coming into the station.</i>

01:30:31.581 --> 01:30:33.665
<i>And from a pink and white car...</i>

01:30:33.750 --> 01:30:36.585
<i>- Napaloni and his wife will step onto a crimson carpet...
- Present arms!</i>

01:30:36.669 --> 01:30:39.254
<i>where Adenoid Hynkel will deliver
his address of welcome.</i>

01:30:51.017 --> 01:30:52.684
What's the matter with this stupid -

01:30:53.936 --> 01:30:55.604
Hey! What's all of this-a mix-up-a?

01:30:55.688 --> 01:30:57.522
Come on. They've gone too far.

01:30:59.025 --> 01:31:01.943
At ease! Bring along the carpet.

01:31:02.028 --> 01:31:04.196
Papa, why can't we get out here?

01:31:04.280 --> 01:31:06.948
- There is no carpet.
- Who cares about a carpet?

01:31:07.033 --> 01:31:10.535
Il Dig-a-Ditchy, me - Napaloni.
I never get out without a carpet.

01:31:16.209 --> 01:31:18.752
Come on.
Lay it down here. Quick.

01:31:18.836 --> 01:31:20.295
- Hurry up!
- It's going back again!

01:31:20.379 --> 01:31:21.505
What?

01:31:24.801 --> 01:31:27.928
What do you do? You salami?

01:31:30.139 --> 01:31:32.557
Let's get out!
Let's get out while it's stopping!

01:31:32.642 --> 01:31:34.059
Shut up!

01:31:37.772 --> 01:31:39.940
Hurry. Quick. Put it down.

01:31:41.234 --> 01:31:43.109
Take it away. Take it away.

01:31:43.194 --> 01:31:46.655
Stay here. Stay here
until they've made up their mind.

01:31:51.953 --> 01:31:54.746
You got-a the carpet?
Well, put 'em-a down!

01:31:55.581 --> 01:31:57.666
Hmm. Oh, come on, come on.

01:32:01.087 --> 01:32:03.004
Here he is.

01:32:04.340 --> 01:32:05.924
- My friend!
- Napaloni!

01:32:09.011 --> 01:32:11.346
- This is indeed a pleasure.
- Thank you.

01:32:11.430 --> 01:32:14.641
Welcome to Tomainia. This way.

01:32:14.725 --> 01:32:16.101
Pictures, Your Excellencies?

01:32:16.185 --> 01:32:18.520
Oh, sure. Salute!

01:32:18.604 --> 01:32:20.105
Another one, please.

01:32:20.189 --> 01:32:22.607
Ah, this is really a pleasure
to be here, my friend Hynkel.

01:32:23.359 --> 01:32:25.443
Oh, you want another picture?
Just a moment.

01:32:25.528 --> 01:32:26.528
There.

01:32:31.534 --> 01:32:33.785
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!
- My bambino!

01:32:33.870 --> 01:32:35.829
- All right. It's all right-a, Mama.
- Get rid of those men.

01:32:35.913 --> 01:32:37.038
- Where is my ambassador?
- Dismissed.

01:32:37.123 --> 01:32:38.874
- There you are. Hello, Spook.
- Your Excellency.

01:32:38.958 --> 01:32:41.710
How do you feel?
Good! Look after Mama.

01:32:41.794 --> 01:32:43.545
Oh, Hynkie, did you meet-a my wife?

01:32:43.629 --> 01:32:44.754
- Your wife?
- That's her.

01:32:44.839 --> 01:32:45.839
- I -
- Let's go.

01:32:47.300 --> 01:32:50.218
Tomainia! Very nice. Very nice.

01:32:51.971 --> 01:32:54.347
Present... arms!

01:32:54.432 --> 01:32:58.226
Napaloni! Napaloni!

01:33:09.906 --> 01:33:11.698
Clock is a-two minutes-a slow.

01:33:12.408 --> 01:33:13.825
This way.

01:33:27.423 --> 01:33:31.092
Napaloni! Napaloni!

01:33:31.177 --> 01:33:32.677
Napaloni!

01:33:37.683 --> 01:33:39.935
It's-a very nice-a people.

01:33:40.019 --> 01:33:43.772
- I say, the people are very nice.
- Oh, yes. Thank you.

01:33:45.691 --> 01:33:47.192
- He is my husband!
- Keep back!

01:33:47.276 --> 01:33:48.443
- You make a mistake!
- Let me go!

01:33:48.527 --> 01:33:50.195
- You make a big-a mistake-a!
- Get back!

01:33:50.279 --> 01:33:51.488
Please!

01:33:53.491 --> 01:33:55.700
At all costs, Napaloni shall not
invade Osterlich.

01:33:55.785 --> 01:33:57.369
That country belongs to me.

01:33:57.453 --> 01:34:00.580
At this meeting we shall not
discuss the Osterlich situation.

01:34:00.665 --> 01:34:04.042
This interview is solely to impress upon him
the force of your personality.

01:34:04.126 --> 01:34:07.295
- Hmm.
- To make him feel your superiority.

01:34:08.756 --> 01:34:10.924
This man Napaloni
is aggressive, domineering.

01:34:11.008 --> 01:34:13.301
Before we make our demands,
we must put him in his place.

01:34:13.386 --> 01:34:16.304
- Precisely. But how?
- By means of applied psychology.

01:34:16.389 --> 01:34:19.224
In other words,
by making him feel inferior.

01:34:19.308 --> 01:34:21.309
This can be done in many subtle ways.

01:34:21.394 --> 01:34:24.479
For instance, at this interview,
I have so arranged...

01:34:24.563 --> 01:34:26.940
that he will always be
looking up at you...

01:34:27.024 --> 01:34:28.650
you looking down at him.

01:34:28.734 --> 01:34:31.277
At all times his position
will be inferior.

01:34:31.362 --> 01:34:33.154
Mmm. Excellent.

01:34:33.239 --> 01:34:37.409
Then again, we shall seat him here
beside your bust...

01:34:37.493 --> 01:34:40.912
so that if you relax,
that will always be glaring at him.

01:34:40.997 --> 01:34:43.331
And?

01:34:43.416 --> 01:34:44.874
Where is he now?

01:34:44.959 --> 01:34:47.794
Resting.
When he arrives, I have arranged...

01:34:47.878 --> 01:34:50.755
that he shall enter
from the far end of the room.

01:34:50.840 --> 01:34:53.091
Another psychological triumph.

01:34:53.175 --> 01:34:56.594
He will have the embarrassment of walking
the entire length of the floor toward you.

01:34:56.679 --> 01:34:59.055
Very good.

01:35:01.392 --> 01:35:02.684
Yes?

01:35:02.768 --> 01:35:05.520
<i>His Excellency
Signor Napaloni is now leaving his room.</i>

01:35:05.604 --> 01:35:09.107
He's coming! He's coming!
Quick, get me a flower. A flower.

01:35:09.191 --> 01:35:11.443
Remember, at all times you must be
above him, before him.

01:35:11.527 --> 01:35:13.445
Entering or leaving,
you must be first.

01:35:19.869 --> 01:35:22.037
Hello, Hynkie!

01:35:22.121 --> 01:35:25.957
<i>Wie Gootz! Wie geht's!</i>

01:35:26.042 --> 01:35:28.001
How-a you feel?

01:35:31.464 --> 01:35:34.382
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Ah, my brother dictator!

01:35:35.176 --> 01:35:37.135
You are a nice little man, a-Hynkie!

01:35:37.219 --> 01:35:40.805
I'm so glad to see you again.

01:35:40.890 --> 01:35:43.475
And my friend the Garbitsch!
Hello!

01:35:44.643 --> 01:35:47.062
Ah, this is a lovely place.

01:35:47.146 --> 01:35:50.148
I feel-a fine.
I just had a nice-a cold shower.

01:35:50.232 --> 01:35:54.194
And that bathtub - as soon as you get
the plumbing fixed, it'll be in-a good-a shape.

01:35:55.571 --> 01:35:57.405
Your Excellency, won't you sit down.

01:35:57.490 --> 01:35:58.990
Oh, shoot, shoot.

01:36:20.471 --> 01:36:23.640
Well-a, Hynkie, my dictator friend, you -

01:36:28.771 --> 01:36:30.355
I must be-a growing.

01:36:32.024 --> 01:36:34.192
Not sure why they gave me
a baby stool.

01:36:42.868 --> 01:36:46.204
This-a stool is not for me.
I like it-a better up-a-stairs here.

01:36:46.288 --> 01:36:48.414
You know-a something, Garbitsch?
This is a lovely country.

01:36:48.499 --> 01:36:49.958
Very nice-a people.

01:36:50.042 --> 01:36:52.460
I thought the public extremely enthusiastic
on your arrival.

01:36:52.545 --> 01:36:54.879
Sure. They like to see new faces.

01:36:58.384 --> 01:37:02.095
I'm sorry for the mishap that occurred
to Madam Napaloni at the railroad station.

01:37:02.179 --> 01:37:04.013
What's that? What's that?

01:37:04.098 --> 01:37:08.059
I'm sorry for the Napaloni
that occurred at the - at the rail -

01:37:08.894 --> 01:37:11.146
Madam Napaloni at the railway station.

01:37:11.897 --> 01:37:15.316
Oh, she's not used to public life.
She can't take it.

01:37:15.401 --> 01:37:16.484
Match.

01:37:16.569 --> 01:37:18.319
Oh - I'm sorry. I'm -

01:37:18.404 --> 01:37:21.906
No, that's all right.
Don't apologize. I find-a one.

01:37:23.659 --> 01:37:26.911
I am simply crazy about this a-palace.

01:37:26.996 --> 01:37:29.914
Ivory and gold -
that makes a lovely combination.

01:37:29.999 --> 01:37:33.418
Gets away from that gingerbread idea.
Say, tell me something-a, Garbitsch.

01:37:34.503 --> 01:37:36.004
What's on the program?

01:37:36.088 --> 01:37:38.339
- There's the grand ball this evening.
- Grand ball?

01:37:38.424 --> 01:37:41.509
The grand ball. And this afternoon,
a review of the army.

01:37:41.594 --> 01:37:43.553
Review of the army?
Well, that won't take-a long.

01:37:43.637 --> 01:37:47.098
- I'm afraid it will.
- Oh? So you got a big army, huh?

01:37:47.183 --> 01:37:49.517
Modesty forbids.

01:37:50.436 --> 01:37:52.187
Yes, seems I've heard
something about it.

01:37:52.271 --> 01:37:54.606
If I'm gonna review the army,
I think I'll get me a shave.

01:37:54.690 --> 01:37:57.192
- We have a barbershop in the palace.
- Is that so?

01:37:58.110 --> 01:38:00.486
Hynkie, you look a little blue
under the gills.

01:38:00.571 --> 01:38:03.448
- What do you say we take a shave together?
- I should be delighted.

01:38:03.532 --> 01:38:05.491
- Good!
- Very well. This way.

01:38:15.377 --> 01:38:17.879
Ah, this is the barbershop.
I can-a smell 'em.

01:38:25.638 --> 01:38:27.555
Ah, now this is-a sweet -
a- very sweet.

01:38:27.640 --> 01:38:30.308
- Do you like it? It was the emperor's library.
- Makes a good a-barbershop.

01:38:30.392 --> 01:38:32.644
- Too old fashioned. I want something modern.
- Is that so?

01:38:32.728 --> 01:38:35.813
You see, when I get shaved, I'm very nervous.
I like something to look at.

01:38:35.898 --> 01:38:37.899
So I'm putting in glass walls and ceiling...

01:38:37.983 --> 01:38:40.818
so that when my head is turned this way,
I shall have a view of the mountains.

01:38:41.695 --> 01:38:44.322
And when it's tipped this way,
I shall have a view through the glass ceiling.

01:38:44.406 --> 01:38:46.199
- What's above-a the ceiling?
- The ballroom.

01:38:48.410 --> 01:38:50.912
Then in my summer palace
I have a barbershop.

01:38:52.748 --> 01:38:55.041
Is that so?

01:38:55.125 --> 01:38:56.542
Yes.

01:38:56.627 --> 01:38:58.670
That also has glass walls.

01:38:58.754 --> 01:39:00.255
You don't tell me.

01:39:00.339 --> 01:39:03.591
Oh, yes.
With goldfish swimming inside.

01:39:03.676 --> 01:39:05.593
Wait a minute.
Goldfish swimming inside-a the walls?

01:39:05.678 --> 01:39:07.345
- Mm-hmm.
- How do you feed 'em?

01:39:07.429 --> 01:39:10.932
You can't. They're all dead.
That's why I'm building a new barbershop.

01:39:13.852 --> 01:39:16.437
- Very interesting. Very interesting.
- Yes? Do you like it?

01:39:21.443 --> 01:39:23.027
<i>This is the Hynkel Stadium.</i>

01:39:23.112 --> 01:39:26.948
<i>Before a half million spectators, the greatest
display of arms the world has ever known...</i>

01:39:27.032 --> 01:39:29.033
<i>marches by in review.</i>

01:39:29.118 --> 01:39:31.119
<i>Our beloved Phooey
and Il Dig-a-Ditchy are seated...</i>

01:39:31.203 --> 01:39:34.414
<i>in the reviewing stand,
thrilled by this historic event.</i>

01:39:35.416 --> 01:39:36.416
What?

01:39:36.500 --> 01:39:38.126
Nothing. I'm just chewing.

01:39:39.962 --> 01:39:41.879
- Ah, yes.
- Would you care for some peanuts?

01:39:42.965 --> 01:39:46.301
- Thank you. I've had some.
- Oh. Good shape. Here you are, Spook.

01:39:46.385 --> 01:39:48.636
<i>Now passing -
Tomainia's heavy artillery.</i>

01:39:50.472 --> 01:39:51.973
It's all right.

01:39:52.057 --> 01:39:55.852
I want to show you my new bombing planes.
I just called up a half hour ago to start 'em over.

01:39:55.936 --> 01:39:57.562
- Where are they coming from?
- Aroma.

01:39:57.646 --> 01:39:59.314
Aroma? That's 400 miles away.

01:39:59.398 --> 01:40:02.025
That's right. They should be here now.
I don't know what's detaining them.

01:40:02.109 --> 01:40:04.861
<i>Now passing -
Tomainia's light artillery.</i>

01:40:09.658 --> 01:40:11.659
Hmm. That's very light.

01:40:11.744 --> 01:40:13.578
<i>And here come the armored tanks...</i>

01:40:13.662 --> 01:40:15.496
<i>the pride of Tomainia's army.</i>

01:40:15.581 --> 01:40:18.916
<i>The latest design,
the last word in modern warfare.</i>

01:40:19.918 --> 01:40:22.003
Wait a minute.
Where's the propellers?

01:40:22.087 --> 01:40:24.255
- Propellers?
- Sure. For going under the water.

01:40:24.340 --> 01:40:26.341
- Tanks that go under the water?
- Submarine work!

01:40:26.425 --> 01:40:30.094
You never heard of aero-marine tanks that
go under the water and then fly up-a-stairs?

01:40:30.179 --> 01:40:33.181
- What's that?
- Tanks that go under the water and fly in the air.

01:40:33.265 --> 01:40:35.433
Oh, yes. Those are obsolete now.

01:40:35.517 --> 01:40:37.769
We're concentrating
on flying dreadnoughts.

01:40:37.853 --> 01:40:40.229
Flying dreadnoughts.

01:40:45.361 --> 01:40:46.986
- What's that?
- My planes!

01:40:47.071 --> 01:40:50.448
<i>Now passing -
Hynkel's flying division number 34.</i>

01:40:50.532 --> 01:40:52.116
Our planes!

01:40:57.456 --> 01:40:59.832
You're right. They're yours.

01:41:24.983 --> 01:41:26.150
Ah, Garbitsch.

01:41:27.319 --> 01:41:29.237
The invasion of Osterlich.

01:41:29.321 --> 01:41:33.408
It's all so simple. Our troops, tanks
and guns will be hidden along the border.

01:41:33.492 --> 01:41:36.494
To disarm suspicion, you will go hunting -
duck shooting or something.

01:41:36.578 --> 01:41:39.247
At the appointed time, you will show up
at the village of Pretzelberg...

01:41:39.331 --> 01:41:43.167
meet the army, step into an automobile
and cross over into Osterlich.

01:41:43.252 --> 01:41:46.170
Herring and I will be waiting
at the capital to receive you.

01:41:46.255 --> 01:41:48.589
First, Napaloni must remove
his troops from the border.

01:41:48.674 --> 01:41:50.258
That question will be decided tonight.

01:41:50.342 --> 01:41:51.801
Where is Napaloni?

01:41:51.885 --> 01:41:53.970
I'll see if I can find him.
In the meantime...

01:41:54.054 --> 01:41:56.848
it might be advisable for you
to dance with Madam Napaloni.

01:41:58.517 --> 01:41:59.976
It'll carry weight.

01:42:00.060 --> 01:42:01.686
You mean I will carry weight.

01:42:05.732 --> 01:42:07.525
You find him. Let me know at once.

01:42:12.948 --> 01:42:16.117
- Madam Napaloni.
- Your Excellency.

01:42:16.201 --> 01:42:18.619
Why so triste?

01:42:18.704 --> 01:42:20.538
'Cause I no speak-a.

01:42:20.622 --> 01:42:22.790
No? May I have the pleasure
of this dance?

01:42:22.875 --> 01:42:24.167
Oh, yes.

01:42:24.251 --> 01:42:25.751
Allow me.

01:42:56.575 --> 01:42:59.827
Madam, your dancing was superb.

01:42:59.912 --> 01:43:01.204
Excellent.

01:43:01.288 --> 01:43:02.788
Very good.

01:43:02.873 --> 01:43:04.123
Good.

01:43:17.179 --> 01:43:18.930
- Ah, my dear Adenoid!
- Benzine!

01:43:19.014 --> 01:43:21.766
I've been-a looking for you all evening.
What do you say we have a sandwich...

01:43:21.850 --> 01:43:25.228
go to some quiet little place where we can
sit down and talk-a things over, huh?

01:43:25.312 --> 01:43:28.773
- As you wish.
- An excellent idea! Gentlemen, to the buffet.

01:43:28.857 --> 01:43:30.525
Of course. This way.

01:43:48.961 --> 01:43:50.628
There's an old Tomainian proverb.

01:43:55.551 --> 01:43:58.803
That's very funny! I wish I understand it.

01:43:58.887 --> 01:44:00.429
Now, about the border situation.

01:44:00.514 --> 01:44:02.723
- Ah, yes, yes. No problem.
- Oh, it should be no trouble at all.

01:44:02.808 --> 01:44:03.975
- Shh, shh.
- Not at all.

01:44:04.059 --> 01:44:05.226
- What's the matter?
- Wait.

01:44:05.310 --> 01:44:07.311
Out!

01:44:09.815 --> 01:44:11.899
You two, out!

01:44:16.280 --> 01:44:17.280
Out.

01:44:20.158 --> 01:44:22.577
- Out?
- Out.

01:44:22.661 --> 01:44:23.995
Out?

01:44:24.997 --> 01:44:26.163
Out.

01:44:28.750 --> 01:44:31.669
As I was saying, about the border question.

01:44:31.753 --> 01:44:35.214
- Ah, yes, yes, yes.
- Just a matter of detail. Mere formalities.

01:44:35.299 --> 01:44:36.382
Strawberries.

01:44:36.466 --> 01:44:38.134
Pardon me.
Have you English mustard?

01:44:38.218 --> 01:44:40.261
- English mustard, Your Excellency.
- That's the hot-a stuff?

01:44:40.345 --> 01:44:41.804
- Very hot.
- Ah, good shape, good shape.

01:44:41.888 --> 01:44:43.723
- Cream.
- Cream, Your Excellency.

01:44:43.807 --> 01:44:47.018
Now, Hynkie, as far as I'm concerned,
I'm gonna make this very simple.

01:44:47.102 --> 01:44:50.021
This is the treaty -
You agree not to invade Osterlich...

01:44:50.105 --> 01:44:51.731
I agree not to invade Osterlich.

01:44:51.815 --> 01:44:54.609
We sign-a the treaty,
then I remove-a my troops from the border.

01:44:54.693 --> 01:44:56.861
Good. In other words, when your troops
are off the border, I sign.

01:44:56.945 --> 01:44:58.112
- That's-a right.
- Very good.

01:44:58.196 --> 01:45:01.699
Oh, just a minute.
You don't understand.

01:45:01.783 --> 01:45:04.869
First we sign-a the treaty,
then I remove-a the troops.

01:45:04.953 --> 01:45:07.038
Precisely. I sign when your troops
are off the border.

01:45:07.122 --> 01:45:09.957
Just a minute.
Hey, Spook, treaty.

01:45:10.792 --> 01:45:12.084
Hold-a this.

01:45:12.169 --> 01:45:13.628
Now, look.

01:45:13.712 --> 01:45:15.880
You a-sign this-a treaty a-first...

01:45:15.964 --> 01:45:18.341
then I remove-a the troops after.

01:45:18.425 --> 01:45:21.385
- Well, what are we arguing about?
- You just said I remove-a the troops a-first.

01:45:21.470 --> 01:45:23.888
You don't expect me to sign
while your troops are there on the border?

01:45:23.972 --> 01:45:26.098
You don't expect me to remove-a
the troops until you sign?

01:45:26.183 --> 01:45:27.224
- Why not?
- Why should I?

01:45:27.309 --> 01:45:29.226
- Why shouldn't you? Osterlich is a free country.
- So?

01:45:29.311 --> 01:45:31.479
Your soldiers are there,
on the Osterlich border!

01:45:31.563 --> 01:45:33.939
And they'll stay there
until you sign this-a treaty!

01:45:34.024 --> 01:45:36.317
You'll take them off, or I'll blow them off!

01:45:36.401 --> 01:45:38.235
Gentlemen, this won't get us anywhere.

01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:40.571
Your Excellency, to quote
an old Latin phrase -

01:45:42.366 --> 01:45:44.075
He's a-right! Speak-a to him!

01:45:44.159 --> 01:45:45.159
Strawberries.

01:45:45.243 --> 01:45:47.495
Where's my-a sandwich?
Well, give me another one!

01:45:47.579 --> 01:45:49.830
- Can't we sit down and discuss this -
- I'm a guest-a here.

01:45:49.915 --> 01:45:52.083
Nobody talk to me in my own-a joint
like that!

01:45:52.167 --> 01:45:54.543
Can't we sit down and discuss this thing
without passion?

01:45:54.628 --> 01:45:57.004
I am not-a passionate.
I am-a just, that's all.

01:45:57.089 --> 01:45:59.590
I want him to sign-a the treaty.
I'll remove the troops.

01:45:59.675 --> 01:46:02.134
Can't you understand?
What would my people think...

01:46:02.219 --> 01:46:05.680
signing such a treaty when your soldiers
are there on the Osterlich border?

01:46:05.764 --> 01:46:07.807
I will not-a move a-soldiers
until you-a sign!

01:46:07.891 --> 01:46:10.768
Not until you clear that border
will I sign anything.

01:46:10.852 --> 01:46:13.187
- Then my soldiers remain!
- Then I kick them off!

01:46:13.271 --> 01:46:17.108
One move-a from you, Hynkie, and my artillery
take-a like this and blow you to pieces!

01:46:17.192 --> 01:46:20.903
Yes, and my aeroplanes will bomb
your artillery like that!

01:46:20.987 --> 01:46:23.030
You want to start a world-a war?
I'll get you one!

01:46:23.115 --> 01:46:25.366
You and the world!
I'll throw in the ocean!

01:46:25.450 --> 01:46:26.784
- Mmm!
- Gentlemen, please!

01:46:38.797 --> 01:46:43.342
I'm-a coming home!
I cannot talk to this ignoramus!

01:46:43.427 --> 01:46:44.385
Strawberries!

01:46:44.469 --> 01:46:46.804
Your Excellency,
we have a very important position...

01:46:46.888 --> 01:46:48.639
that I must urge upon you.

01:46:48.724 --> 01:46:51.142
I know what you must -

01:46:54.396 --> 01:46:58.190
If you would -

01:47:06.575 --> 01:47:08.409
What's wrong?

01:47:08.493 --> 01:47:10.995
I don't give a hoopy!
I got-a my guns here in the pass!

01:47:11.079 --> 01:47:13.664
If he start-a something,
I'll blow him to "passes!"

01:47:17.753 --> 01:47:20.421
Excellency, what's the matter?
What ails you? What has -

01:47:20.505 --> 01:47:23.591
- Your Excellency, this isn't like you.
- Hey! What is the matter?

01:47:23.675 --> 01:47:25.426
Hey, Garbitsch, come here!

01:47:25.510 --> 01:47:27.178
What is the matter with-a Hynkie?

01:47:27.262 --> 01:47:28.929
He's put mustard on his strawberries.

01:47:29.014 --> 01:47:31.932
Mustard -
What else-a can you expect from Hynkie?

01:47:36.188 --> 01:47:37.605
Il Dig-a-Ditchy!

01:47:37.689 --> 01:47:39.440
What? What's the matter? What?

01:47:39.524 --> 01:47:42.735
My little bambino!

01:47:56.124 --> 01:47:57.875
...the Bacterian -
... Tomainia -

01:47:59.795 --> 01:48:02.213
You cannot treat-a
the Bacterian people this way!

01:48:02.297 --> 01:48:05.883
I'll take the Bacterian people
and I'll tear them apart like this!

01:48:05.967 --> 01:48:08.177
- Excellency, please!
- Look! Look what he's-a doing!

01:48:08.261 --> 01:48:11.889
It's an insult to my people!

01:48:11.973 --> 01:48:14.517
Look, he's-a pulling spaghetti!
The spaghetti!

01:48:14.601 --> 01:48:16.852
He either sign-a the treaty,
or we have a war!

01:48:16.937 --> 01:48:18.437
- Ooh!
- Listen! Listen!

01:48:18.522 --> 01:48:21.690
Give me a-something! Quick!
Give me a-something! I want to -

01:48:25.403 --> 01:48:27.905
- But it's all right. I have an appointment.
- What's this?

01:48:27.989 --> 01:48:30.533
I'm from the international press.
How's the conference progressing?

01:48:30.617 --> 01:48:33.410
Very successfully. How did you get in?
Excuse me, will you?

01:48:34.663 --> 01:48:36.831
How did this man get in here?

01:48:36.915 --> 01:48:40.167
You know the regulations of the palace in
regard to reporters. Go down to Captain Block.

01:48:40.252 --> 01:48:42.837
Tell him not to allow anyone else to enter
the palace under any circumstances tonight.

01:48:42.921 --> 01:48:44.964
- You understand?
- Yes, sir.

01:48:48.176 --> 01:48:51.679
Of course, there are minor details
to be cleaned up, things that you must -

01:48:52.931 --> 01:48:54.598
Excuse me. We're very busy.

01:48:59.354 --> 01:49:01.480
- Oh!
- Gentlemen, please!

01:49:01.565 --> 01:49:03.983
The press are outside. The whole world
will know that we're fighting.

01:49:04.067 --> 01:49:06.610
- So what?
- Can't we come to some agreement?

01:49:06.695 --> 01:49:09.113
- Not until he-a signs!
- I sign nothing!

01:49:09.197 --> 01:49:11.282
Your Excellency,
I must speak to you alone.

01:49:11.366 --> 01:49:13.117
- Do you mind?
- Mind? I don't a-mind!

01:49:13.201 --> 01:49:15.452
- What is it?
- Sign. Sign.

01:49:15.537 --> 01:49:17.079
Why should he have the advantage?

01:49:17.163 --> 01:49:19.164
What does it matter,
a mere scrap of paper?

01:49:19.249 --> 01:49:21.166
The moment you sign,
he'll take his troops off the border.

01:49:21.251 --> 01:49:23.294
We can move in without losing a man.

01:49:24.713 --> 01:49:26.046
I'll sign.

01:49:26.131 --> 01:49:28.215
What?
Hold-a this!

01:49:28.300 --> 01:49:30.551
Ah, my little Hynkie!

01:49:30.635 --> 01:49:34.221
My-a dictator brother!
I knew we have-a no trouble!

01:49:39.978 --> 01:49:43.397
Two prisoners escaped in officers' uniforms!
Officers tied up in the guard room!

01:49:44.149 --> 01:49:46.483
Sound the alarm!
Two prisoners escaped! Come on!

01:50:05.003 --> 01:50:06.837
The planes are searching for us.

01:50:06.922 --> 01:50:08.255
Let's make for the woods.

01:50:08.340 --> 01:50:11.008
No. We must keep in the open.
The border's that way.

01:50:12.761 --> 01:50:14.845
The invasion of Osterlich.

01:50:16.097 --> 01:50:18.682
Now... or never.

01:50:24.481 --> 01:50:25.814
Ducks!

01:50:30.779 --> 01:50:32.529
Did you hear that?

01:50:32.614 --> 01:50:34.740
Came from over there. Come on.

01:50:45.710 --> 01:50:47.086
<i>Da Blitzen!</i>

01:50:50.090 --> 01:50:51.590
Cheese and crackers!

01:50:54.260 --> 01:50:55.761
<i>...da Blitzen!</i>

01:50:56.638 --> 01:50:59.431
A yodeler, huh?
Where'd you get that outfit?

01:50:59.516 --> 01:51:01.225
- What?
- Don't answer back!

01:51:03.687 --> 01:51:06.730
Where's your partner? Where's Schultz?
You won't talk, huh?

01:51:06.815 --> 01:51:09.650
- He'll talk when he gets into camp!
- Come on!

01:51:11.820 --> 01:51:15.406
There it is -
the village of Pretzelberg.

01:51:15.490 --> 01:51:17.157
Pretzelberg.

01:51:17.242 --> 01:51:20.077
If we can pass through there,
we're safe across the Osterlich border.

01:51:20.161 --> 01:51:22.079
- Couldn't we go through the woods?
- Of course not.

01:51:22.163 --> 01:51:24.832
The woods are swarming with soldiers.
They'd suspect us at once.

01:51:24.916 --> 01:51:28.460
We must face the music.
If you see anyone, don't look right or left.

01:51:28.545 --> 01:51:31.255
We must bluff our way through.
Remember, you're a storm trooper.

01:51:32.090 --> 01:51:33.590
Here they come.

01:51:42.267 --> 01:51:44.059
Can you see what they're doing?

01:51:47.188 --> 01:51:49.732
- They're looking this way.
- Well, pay no attention. Keep going.

01:51:52.861 --> 01:51:55.779
They're beginning to follow us.
Shall we run?

01:51:55.864 --> 01:51:57.364
Certainly not.

01:51:57.449 --> 01:51:59.616
- Just a little bit?
- Keep walking.

01:52:01.953 --> 01:52:04.705
We could walk a little faster.

01:52:04.789 --> 01:52:07.124
Hmm? Make up your mind.

01:52:18.219 --> 01:52:20.471
- Perhaps we'd better slow down.
- No, no. Keep going.

01:52:20.555 --> 01:52:22.222
- There's no hurry.
- Come on.

01:52:25.894 --> 01:52:27.061
- What is it?
- He's here!

01:52:27.145 --> 01:52:29.730
What? Bugler! Sound assembly!

01:52:39.491 --> 01:52:42.659
Company! Attention!

01:52:43.745 --> 01:52:46.246
Present... arms!

01:52:49.918 --> 01:52:53.128
- You don't want to change your mind and turn back?
- No, keep going. Keep going.

01:52:54.506 --> 01:52:57.007
- Hail Hynkel.
- Order... arms!

01:52:58.843 --> 01:53:01.678
Your Excellency will be pleased to know
that everything is under control.

01:53:01.763 --> 01:53:03.430
- Good.
- Good.

01:53:03.515 --> 01:53:06.934
I have been in continued communication
with Marshal Herring in Osterlich, sir.

01:53:07.018 --> 01:53:09.019
The route ahead of us is well-guarded.

01:53:09.104 --> 01:53:12.773
And at the back of us are 200 tanks,
50 armored cars and 500 machine guns.

01:53:12.857 --> 01:53:14.691
- Is that -
- Good.

01:53:14.776 --> 01:53:17.194
- Good.
- Are we ready to start?

01:53:17.278 --> 01:53:18.529
- Yes.
- Yes.

01:53:19.781 --> 01:53:21.156
Gentlemen.

01:53:27.705 --> 01:53:30.374
Schultz, I'm certainly happy
to see you with us again.

01:53:30.458 --> 01:53:31.792
Thank you.

01:53:38.883 --> 01:53:42.010
- Where are we going?
- You're invading Osterlich.

01:54:55.293 --> 01:54:58.128
Mr. Jaeckel! Mr. Jaeckel!

01:54:58.213 --> 01:55:01.298
- Hannah!
- Mr. Jaeckel, look, they're coming!

01:55:45.802 --> 01:55:47.678
Present... arms!

01:55:49.097 --> 01:55:51.098
Hail Hynkel!

01:55:51.182 --> 01:55:53.433
Hail Hynkel!

01:55:53.518 --> 01:55:55.727
Present... arms!

01:55:57.438 --> 01:56:00.774
Your Excellency,
the world awaits your word.

01:56:33.683 --> 01:56:35.726
What's happened to him?
He looks strange.

01:56:35.810 --> 01:56:37.686
And what's Schultz doing here?

01:56:37.770 --> 01:56:39.104
Pardoned, I suppose.

01:56:51.326 --> 01:57:04.254
Here.

01:57:06.382 --> 01:57:08.675
His Excellency, Herr Garbitsch...

01:57:08.760 --> 01:57:12.137
Secretary of the Interior,
Minister of Propaganda.

01:57:16.976 --> 01:57:19.019
<i>"Corona veniet delectis. "</i>

01:57:19.103 --> 01:57:21.313
"Victory shall come to the worthy. "

01:57:22.190 --> 01:57:27.402
Today, democracy, liberty and equality
are words to fool the people.

01:57:27.487 --> 01:57:30.197
No nation can progress
with such ideas.

01:57:30.281 --> 01:57:31.865
They stand in the way of action.

01:57:31.949 --> 01:57:33.867
Therefore, we frankly abolish them.

01:57:34.869 --> 01:57:39.539
In the future, each man will serve the interest
of the state with absolute obedience.

01:57:39.624 --> 01:57:41.666
Let him who refuses beware.

01:57:41.751 --> 01:57:46.129
The rights of citizenship will be taken away
from all Jews and other non-Aryans.

01:57:46.214 --> 01:57:49.549
They are inferior,
and therefore enemies of the state.

01:57:49.634 --> 01:57:53.053
It is the duty of all true Aryans
to hate and despise them.

01:57:54.263 --> 01:57:57.307
Henceforth, this nation is annexed
to the Tomainian Empire...

01:57:57.392 --> 01:58:01.186
and the people of this nation will obey
the laws bestowed upon us by our great leader...

01:58:02.563 --> 01:58:06.733
the dictator of Tomainia,
the conqueror of Osterlich...

01:58:06.818 --> 01:58:10.695
the future emperor of the world.

01:58:11.739 --> 01:58:13.448
You must speak.

01:58:14.450 --> 01:58:15.909
I can't.

01:58:15.993 --> 01:58:18.578
You must. It's our only hope.

01:58:21.374 --> 01:58:22.707
Hope.

01:59:10.548 --> 01:59:12.132
I'm sorry...

01:59:12.216 --> 01:59:14.134
but I don't want to be an emperor.

01:59:14.218 --> 01:59:16.303
That's not my business.

01:59:16.387 --> 01:59:18.889
I don't want to rule or conquer anyone.

01:59:18.973 --> 01:59:20.891
I should like to help everyone,
if possible -

01:59:20.975 --> 01:59:24.227
Jew, gentile, black man, white.

01:59:24.312 --> 01:59:27.898
We all want to help one another.
Human beings are like that.

01:59:27.982 --> 01:59:31.234
We want to live by each other's happiness,
not by each other's misery.

01:59:31.319 --> 01:59:33.737
We don't want to hate and despise
one another.

01:59:33.821 --> 01:59:36.990
In this world, there's room for everyone,
and the good earth is rich...

01:59:37.074 --> 01:59:38.992
and can provide for everyone.

01:59:39.076 --> 01:59:42.120
The way of life can be free and beautiful.

01:59:42.205 --> 01:59:44.247
But we have lost the way.

01:59:44.332 --> 01:59:46.875
Greed has poisoned men's souls...

01:59:46.959 --> 01:59:49.252
has barricaded the world with hate...

01:59:49.337 --> 01:59:52.255
has goose-stepped us
into misery and bloodshed.

01:59:52.340 --> 01:59:55.717
We have developed speed,
but we have shut ourselves in.

01:59:55.801 --> 01:59:58.845
Machinery that gives abundance
has left us in want.

01:59:58.930 --> 02:00:02.849
Our knowledge has made us cynical,
our cleverness hard and unkind.

02:00:02.934 --> 02:00:05.769
We think too much and feel too little.

02:00:05.853 --> 02:00:08.438
More than machinery,
we need humanity.

02:00:08.523 --> 02:00:12.108
More than cleverness,
we need kindness and gentleness.

02:00:12.193 --> 02:00:16.446
Without these qualities, life will be violent,
and all will be lost.

02:00:16.531 --> 02:00:19.241
The aeroplane and the radio
have brought us closer together.

02:00:19.325 --> 02:00:22.536
These very nature of these inventions
cries out for the goodness in men...

02:00:22.620 --> 02:00:26.039
cries out for universal brotherhood,
for the unity of us all.

02:00:26.123 --> 02:00:29.125
Even now, my voice is reaching
millions throughout the world...

02:00:29.210 --> 02:00:32.420
millions of despairing men,
women and little children...

02:00:32.505 --> 02:00:37.509
victims of a system that makes men torture
and imprison innocent people.

02:00:37.593 --> 02:00:40.971
To those who can hear me I say,
do not despair.

02:00:41.055 --> 02:00:44.224
The misery that is now upon us
is but the passing of greed...

02:00:44.308 --> 02:00:48.061
the bitterness of men who fear
the way of human progress.

02:00:48.145 --> 02:00:51.439
The hate of men will pass,
and dictators die...

02:00:51.524 --> 02:00:55.068
and the power they took from the people
will return to the people.

02:00:55.152 --> 02:00:58.947
And so long as men die,
liberty will never perish.

02:01:00.324 --> 02:01:02.993
Soldiers,
don't give yourselves to brutes...

02:01:03.077 --> 02:01:06.746
men who despise you, enslave you,
who regiment your lives...

02:01:06.831 --> 02:01:09.082
tell you what to do,
what to think and what to feel...

02:01:09.166 --> 02:01:13.503
who drill you, diet you, treat you like cattle,
use you as cannon fodder!

02:01:13.588 --> 02:01:16.172
Don't give yourselves
to these unnatural men -

02:01:16.257 --> 02:01:19.843
machine men with machine minds
and machine hearts!

02:01:19.927 --> 02:01:23.680
You are not machines!
You are not cattle! You are men!

02:01:23.764 --> 02:01:26.016
You have the love of humanity
in your hearts.

02:01:26.100 --> 02:01:28.435
You don't hate.
Only the unloved hate.

02:01:28.519 --> 02:01:30.437
The unloved and the unnatural.

02:01:30.521 --> 02:01:34.024
Soldiers, don't fight for slavery,
fight for liberty!

02:01:34.108 --> 02:01:36.151
In the 17th chapter of Saint Luke
it is written...

02:01:36.235 --> 02:01:37.861
"The kingdom of God is within man. "

02:01:37.945 --> 02:01:41.531
Not one man nor a group of men,
but in all men - in you!

02:01:41.616 --> 02:01:43.658
You the people have the power -

02:01:43.743 --> 02:01:46.745
the power to create machines,
the power to create happiness!

02:01:46.829 --> 02:01:50.373
You the people have the power
to make this life free and beautiful...

02:01:50.458 --> 02:01:52.709
to make this life a wonderful adventure.

02:01:52.793 --> 02:01:55.962
Then, in the name of democracy,
let us use that power!

02:01:56.047 --> 02:01:57.631
Let us all unite!

02:01:57.715 --> 02:02:01.134
Let us fight for a new world,
a decent world...

02:02:01.218 --> 02:02:02.969
that will give men a chance to work...

02:02:03.054 --> 02:02:06.056
that will give youth a future
and old age a security.

02:02:06.140 --> 02:02:09.100
By the promise of these things,
brutes have risen to power.

02:02:09.185 --> 02:02:13.063
But they lie. They do not fulfill that promise.
They never will!

02:02:13.147 --> 02:02:16.900
Dictators free themselves,
but they enslave the people.

02:02:16.984 --> 02:02:20.070
Now let us fight to fulfill that promise!

02:02:20.154 --> 02:02:22.405
Let us fight to free the world...

02:02:22.490 --> 02:02:26.076
to do away with national barriers,
to do away with greed...

02:02:26.160 --> 02:02:28.161
with hate and intolerance.

02:02:28.245 --> 02:02:32.832
Let us fight for a world of reason,
a world where science and progress...

02:02:32.917 --> 02:02:35.251
will lead to all men's happiness.

02:02:35.336 --> 02:02:39.673
Soldiers, in the name of democracy,
let us all unite!

02:03:04.782 --> 02:03:06.074
Hannah...

02:03:07.034 --> 02:03:08.535
can you hear me?

02:03:09.620 --> 02:03:13.206
<i>Wherever you are, look up, Hannah.</i>

02:03:14.041 --> 02:03:16.292
<i>The clouds are lifting.</i>

02:03:16.377 --> 02:03:18.378
<i>The sun is breaking through.</i>

02:03:18.879 --> 02:03:22.382
<i>We are coming out of the darkness
and into the light.</i>

02:03:22.466 --> 02:03:26.803
<i>We are coming into a new world,
a kindlier world...</i>

02:03:26.887 --> 02:03:29.139
<i>where men will rise above their hate...</i>

02:03:29.223 --> 02:03:31.891
<i>their greed and brutality.</i>

02:03:32.893 --> 02:03:34.561
<i>Look up, Hannah.</i>

02:03:34.645 --> 02:03:37.230
<i>The soul of man has been given wings...</i>

02:03:37.314 --> 02:03:40.316
<i>and at last he is beginning to fly.</i>

02:03:40.401 --> 02:03:42.652
<i>He is flying into the rainbow...</i>

02:03:42.737 --> 02:03:46.156
<i>into the light of hope,
into the future -</i>

02:03:46.240 --> 02:03:48.324
<i>the glorious future...</i>

02:03:48.409 --> 02:03:51.327
<i>that belongs to you, to me...</i>

02:03:51.412 --> 02:03:53.246
<i>and to all of us.</i>

02:03:53.330 --> 02:03:56.040
<i>Look up, Hannah. Look up.</i>

02:04:21.192 --> 02:04:24.360
Hannah, did you hear that?

02:04:26.530 --> 02:04:27.864
Listen.
