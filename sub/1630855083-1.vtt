He's here.

04:05.114 --> 04:07.377
Are your assignments ready?

04:08.465 --> 04:09.684
Yes.

04:11.120 --> 04:13.601
Ugh, that collar.

04:15.167 --> 04:17.039
It's okay.

No texting while he's here.

04:28.006 --> 04:29.660
I know, I know.

04:29.791 --> 04:31.923
You told me a million times.

04:35.579 --> 04:38.147
Assalamu alaikum, sister.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.889
Wa alaykumu s-salam,

04:41.019 --> 04:42.456
Hello, Mr. Hamadani.

04:42.586 --> 04:44.545
Hello, Lamya.

04:44.675 --> 04:46.111
Would you like some tea?

04:46.242 --> 04:48.244
I can only stay a minute.

04:48.375 --> 04:51.116
I have lots of Lamya's friends
to visit today.

04:51.247 --> 04:54.424
We are so grateful
that you are doing this.

04:54.555 --> 04:58.298
God willing, the schools
in Aleppo will reopen soon,

04:58.428 --> 05:00.343
and I know that
I can count on Lamya

05:00.474 --> 05:03.041
to help the students
who have fallen behind.

05:03.172 --> 05:06.523
She has the makings
to be a very good
teacher someday.

05:06.654 --> 05:08.699
I finished the book.

05:08.830 --> 05:10.745
[chuckles]
Hmm.

05:10.875 --> 05:13.008
I brought you a new one.

Hmm, very good.

06:11.632 --> 06:14.504
Excellent work, as always.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.554
Aha. Yes.

06:22.251 --> 06:26.386
Do you remember
the first word
of the Revelation?

06:26.516 --> 06:27.691
Mm-hmm.

06:27.822 --> 06:29.171
Hmm?

06:29.301 --> 06:30.781
"Read."

06:30.912 --> 06:33.610
That's right!
"Read."

06:33.741 --> 06:35.699
Our whole faith
is based on a book.

06:35.830 --> 06:39.355
A holy book.
Books are very important.

06:39.486 --> 06:43.403
That's why I only trust
my best students

06:43.533 --> 06:46.928
with books
from my personal library,

06:47.058 --> 06:48.495
like this one.

06:48.625 --> 06:50.018
[giggles]

06:50.148 --> 06:52.890
Do you know who Rumi is?

06:53.021 --> 06:54.457
Um...

06:55.589 --> 06:58.418
He lived a long time ago,
but millions of people

06:58.548 --> 07:00.768
around the world
are still inspired

07:00.898 --> 07:03.031
and helped by his words.

07:03.161 --> 07:05.860
I remember.
Jalal ad-Din Rumi.

07:05.990 --> 07:07.470
You told us about him.

07:07.601 --> 07:10.952
You said he wrote
25,000 lines of poetry.

07:11.082 --> 07:12.519
That's right!

07:12.649 --> 07:15.565
This book only has
a few of them,

07:15.696 --> 07:19.395
but it's special,
very special.

07:22.354 --> 07:24.444
When Rumi was a boy,

07:24.574 --> 07:28.186
he lived in a beautiful city
named Samarkand.

07:30.537 --> 07:35.672
Books flew from the pens
of scholars and poets.

07:35.803 --> 07:40.111
One of the greatest
religious scholars of the time
was his father.

07:40.242 --> 07:43.419
But then, a terrible thing
happened.

07:43.550 --> 07:47.467
A nation of conquerors
called the Mongols invaded.

07:47.597 --> 07:49.599
[men whooping, shouting]

07:53.821 --> 07:56.563
[Mr. Hamadani]
His beautiful city
was destroyed.

07:59.391 --> 08:02.220
He became a refugee.

08:06.137 --> 08:08.618
Here, read this one.

08:09.793 --> 08:13.536
"Listen to the reed
and the tale it tells.

08:13.667 --> 08:17.061
How it sings of separation.

08:17.192 --> 08:19.760
Since I was torn
from my reed bed,

08:19.890 --> 08:25.330
my song has been a strain
of love and pain.

08:25.461 --> 08:29.639
I long for someone
who understands the signs

08:29.770 --> 08:32.947
to mingle their heart
with mine.

08:33.077 --> 08:35.689
To heal a heart that bleeds,

08:35.819 --> 08:39.083
listen, listen to the reed."

08:41.825 --> 08:44.567
We'll discuss the poems
next time.

08:44.698 --> 08:47.222
Maybe you can share them
with some of your friends.

08:52.314 --> 08:54.359
-Good-bye.
-[Mother] Thank you so much.

Why are you burying your flute?

12:18.302 --> 12:19.826
The music was beautiful.

12:22.219 --> 12:25.353
I'm not burying it.
I'm trying to plant it.

12:25.483 --> 12:27.007
Plant it?

12:29.313 --> 12:31.751
It can't grow.

Oh, Jalal ad-Din.

Father?

16:23.895 --> 16:25.593
We have a long day ahead.

16:25.723 --> 16:27.029
Did you sleep well?

16:27.160 --> 16:28.552
[sighs]

16:28.683 --> 16:30.467
Another nightmare?

16:30.598 --> 16:32.121
The Mongols again?

16:32.252 --> 16:35.211
Why are we running, Father?
Why?

16:35.342 --> 16:36.647
We should fight them.

16:36.778 --> 16:38.519
Fight them?

16:38.649 --> 16:40.129
You're still a boy.

16:40.260 --> 16:41.870
What about your studies,
your poems?

16:42.001 --> 16:43.524
Poems?

16:43.654 --> 16:46.875
Forgive me, Father,
but who cares about
poems now?

-Jalal.

16:52.359 --> 16:54.578
My heart is too small.

16:54.709 --> 16:58.582
It can't carry so much sorrow
without fighting back.

16:58.713 --> 17:00.976
Your eyes are even smaller,

17:01.107 --> 17:04.675
yet they can take in
the whole world.

17:04.806 --> 17:07.678
I know it seems
hopeless, Jalal,

17:07.809 --> 17:09.593
but try to look
beyond this moment.

17:09.724 --> 17:13.641
You were made a writer
because someone somewhere

17:13.771 --> 17:15.382
needs your words.

17:15.512 --> 17:18.341
If not today, then tomorrow.

17:18.472 --> 17:22.215
If not here,
then perhaps in a place
you can hardly imagine.

17:23.259 --> 17:25.957
We live in one form
in this world...

17:26.784 --> 17:30.136

18:15.355 --> 18:16.791
Nothing's going to happen.

18:16.921 --> 18:19.663
[sighs] Not today, Lamya.

18:19.794 --> 18:21.665
I have a bad feeling.

18:21.796 --> 18:24.581
You always have
a bad feeling.

18:29.847 --> 18:32.589
I wish you tried this hard
to make Daddy stay home.

18:32.720 --> 18:33.895

-Go!

18:43.774 --> 18:45.602
I tried to stop him.

18:45.733 --> 18:47.343
I begged him not to go.

18:47.474 --> 18:49.345
You remember.

18:49.476 --> 18:52.479
He said that it was
just a demonstration

18:52.609 --> 18:55.134
and I was worrying
too much.

18:55.264 --> 18:56.613

Loss can destroy you,

23:01.249 --> 23:03.469
but it can also be
an opening

23:03.599 --> 23:06.733
to find the true source
of our being.

23:06.863 --> 23:11.564
Loss is the beginning
of all spiritual journeys.

23:11.694 --> 23:14.088
We can continue on this road,
always looking back,

23:14.218 --> 23:16.786
missing what is gone, or...

23:16.917 --> 23:21.617
we can turn our sights
in a better direction.

our brothers and sisters.

23:29.582 --> 23:32.541
The opening we need
might await us there.

23:33.760 --> 23:37.590
Let us declare our intention
to make the pilgrimage.

23:37.720 --> 23:40.027
Prepare yourself
and make ready.

you got there?

25:57.207 --> 25:59.775
Oh-oh, you mean this?

25:59.906 --> 26:02.996

How are we going
to get across the sea?

30:13.507 --> 30:15.901
We'll have to pay someone.

Lamya.

32:02.137 --> 32:03.312
You're leaving?

32:04.661 --> 32:06.533
You should come, too.

32:06.663 --> 32:09.579
There are still children
in Aleppo, Lamya.

32:09.710 --> 32:11.059
They need a teacher.

32:20.634 --> 32:22.853
I told you,
it's a very special book.

32:22.984 --> 32:24.377
A very old book, too.

32:24.507 --> 32:26.683

Let me pay them back with
something they understand.

defeat hate, my boy.

You went to the city?
Bassam, it's dangerous.

1:08:29.496 --> 1:08:31.063
What if you got caught?

1:08:32.020 --> 1:08:34.632
Pfft!
I'm too sneaky.

1:08:34.762 --> 1:08:38.331
Bassam,
you shouldn't steal.

1:08:38.462 --> 1:08:39.550

Everything.

1:09:20.678 --> 1:09:23.811
-Rice pudding.
-Huh?

1:09:23.942 --> 1:09:26.379

Arabic coffee?

1:09:36.520 --> 1:09:39.827
Silly, don't you know
that will give you
a mustache?

1:09:39.958 --> 1:09:41.307
Aw.

1:09:42.395 --> 1:09:44.441

1:10:40.366 --> 1:10:41.976
It fits you well.

1:10:42.107 --> 1:10:44.414
How can you help him?

1:10:44.544 --> 1:10:46.242
He is our enemy.

1:10:46.372 --> 1:10:49.680
He's a pilgrim, like us.

1:10:49.810 --> 1:10:52.857
He is not like us.

1:10:52.987 --> 1:10:55.425
He's a foreigner,
an invader.

1:10:55.555 --> 1:10:58.341
He doesn't deserve
to be here.

1:10:58.471 --> 1:11:01.257
They're all monsters, Father.

1:11:04.042 --> 1:11:08.264
The worst monsters
are the ones that live here.

1:11:09.308 --> 1:11:11.397
Before we are born,
a path is set

1:11:11.528 --> 1:11:14.487
that will lead to the people
who need us the most.

1:11:15.488 --> 1:11:18.535
This is the path of love,

1:11:18.665 --> 1:11:20.450
and you must stay on it.

1:11:26.978 --> 1:11:28.458
