YOU EVER HEARD OF
MY DAD AND VICTOR

14:15.771 --> 14:18.148
BEING IN SOME WEIRD
BAD GUYS CLUB?

14:18.232 --> 14:21.777
- WELL, DUH.
- WHAT?

14:21.860 --> 14:25.698
- COME ON, YOU MUST HAVE KNOWN.
DIDN'T FABIAN TELL YOU?

14:25.781 --> 14:25.864
- TELL WHO WHAT?

14:28.993 --> 14:33.163
- WAIT, SO YOU KNEW MY DAD WAS
PART OF SOME SECRET SOCIETY?

14:33.247 --> 14:34.456
- WE DIDN'T MENTION IT

14:34.540 --> 14:35.958
BECAUSE WE THOUGHT
IT WAS ANCIENT HISTORY.

14:36.041 --> 14:38.210
- YEAH, EDDIE,
WE DIDN'T MEAN TO--

14:38.294 --> 14:42.214
- AMBER, JUST DON'T, OKAY?

14:48.178 --> 14:50.889
- AND BE HONEST.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

14:52.725 --> 14:53.976

14:56.895 --> 14:58.063
YOU REALLY WANT TO GO TO
FASHION SCHOOL, DON'T YOU?

15:00.190 --> 15:02.109

WITH THE PEOPLE.

- OKAY, SO I FOUND SOME
OLD BOOKS IN THE ANTECHAMBER,

15:13.662 --> 15:16.332
AND YOU KNOW HOW I THOUGHT
THIS WAS THE SYMBOL FOR A HOUSE?

15:16.415 --> 15:18.500
WELL, THEN I REALIZED SOMETHING.

15:18.584 --> 15:20.878
THAT SYMBOL ONLY APPEARS
BEFORE THIS ONE.

15:20.961 --> 15:24.423
- LOOKS LIKE A SANDCASTLE.
- ALMOST.

15:24.506 --> 15:26.842
ANCIENT EGYPTIANS USED
TO BUILD TWO BIG TOWERS

15:26.925 --> 15:27.926

15:28.010 --> 15:29.303
IT WAS LIKE
A GATEWAY TO THE CITY.

15:29.386 --> 15:32.848
- SO IT'S A GATEWAY TO THE CITY
AND A HOUSE?

15:32.931 --> 15:36.268
- I'M MISSING THE PART
ABOUT A BREAKTHROUGH.

15:36.352 --> 15:38.520
- SHORTEN "GATEWAY" TO "GATE."

15:38.604 --> 15:42.399
- GATE, GATE, HOUSE...

15:42.483 --> 15:43.692
YOU MEAN GATEHOUSE!

15:43.776 --> 15:46.904
- A PARCEL ARRIVES FOR VICTOR
MENTIONING A GATEHOUSE.

15:46.987 --> 15:49.031
- THE ONE MISS DENBY LIVES IN.

15:49.114 --> 15:51.075
- IF WE WANT TO FIND OUT
WHAT THIS IS FOR,

15:51.158 --> 15:53.243

AT LUNCH.

16:31.281 --> 16:34.034
I WAS IN THE LIBRARY WITH
A PILE OF PAPERS FOR GRADING.

16:35.494 --> 16:38.997

WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

18:49.294 --> 18:50.128
YOU DON'T EVEN LIVE HERE.
