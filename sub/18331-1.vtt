-Because you left me at the airport.

How rude.

Was your plane late?

04:33.606 --> 04:35.358
No, I was right on time.

04:35.441 --> 04:37.735
I even put my bags in Kimmy's car.

04:38.569 --> 04:42.156
I went to move the luggage cart out of
the street and she drove off without me.

04:43.908 --> 04:46.244
I thought you were pretty quiet
on the ride home.

04:48.329 --> 04:50.748
Anyhoo, how was your summer in London?

04:50.832 --> 04:51.916
It was great.

You know, I went back to see
if my ex-boyfriend was really a jerk.

04:55.169 --> 04:56.087
He was.

04:56.713 --> 04:59.716
But I met one of those palace guards
with the big, fuzzy hats.

Looks like you had a fun summer.

05:19.610 --> 05:21.070
It was boring.

05:22.530 --> 05:25.325
Before you guys left,
there was so much going on.

05:25.783 --> 05:27.618
Mom was a Mexican wrestler,

05:28.411 --> 05:30.413
Hunter Pence came to our house,

05:31.289 --> 05:32.999
there was a cow in the kitchen.

05:34.542 --> 05:37.086
The last fun thing
was that ridiculous wedding

05:37.170 --> 05:39.547
where Kimmy decided not to marry Fernando.

05:40.965 --> 05:44.594

Fernando has returned!

While I was gone on the racing circuit,

06:11.037 --> 06:12.497
I forgot to pay my rent,

06:12.580 --> 06:14.540
so my landlord evicted me.

06:14.624 --> 06:15.833
So now...

06:16.459 --> 06:18.544
I will be moving in here!

06:18.628 --> 06:20.296
[laughs]

06:23.216 --> 06:25.635
Perhaps my story was not so funny?

06:27.386 --> 06:29.764
Perhaps you should have paid your rent?

06:32.517 --> 06:34.477
Oh, Max.

06:35.686 --> 06:37.188
I missed you least of all.

06:43.027 --> 06:46.030
No need to worry.
Fernando's only moving in temporarily.

when I tell them which one I wanna date.

Matt is insanely hot.

our lives and not wait around for you?

What did guys do to impress you
way back in the olden days?

13:04.450 --> 13:07.286
Well, you know,
they churned some buttermilk...

13:08.370 --> 13:09.580
raised a barn...

13:11.332 --> 13:15.169
Look, if this is about impressing Lola,
just be yourself. You're a great guy.

13:15.252 --> 13:18.088
[sighs] You're my mom. That means nothing.

13:19.465 --> 13:21.800
OK. How's this?

13:22.343 --> 13:24.512
Women love confidence.

13:24.595 --> 13:28.474
Oh, I used to love when Steve
would make a big confident entrance.

13:28.557 --> 13:31.227
He used to walk right in
and take what he wanted.

13:31.810 --> 13:33.020
From the refrigerator.

13:34.980 --> 13:36.857
Big confident entrance.

13:36.941 --> 13:38.067
I like that.

13:38.150 --> 13:42.071
Yeah. Hey, any girl would be lucky
to have a handsome young man like you.

13:43.239 --> 13:45.866
Thanks, Mom.
But once again, that means nothing.

13:51.914 --> 13:53.249
Kimberlina, mi amor.

13:55.543 --> 13:59.880
Finally, my endless summer
of endless loneliness has ended.

14:01.173 --> 14:02.341
Hold that thought.

14:02.424 --> 14:04.635
I promised DJ and Stephanie
I would talk to you

14:04.718 --> 14:06.762
about moving in without even asking.

14:11.600 --> 14:13.060
What are you doing?

14:13.894 --> 14:14.895
I'm wiggling.

14:16.981 --> 14:18.816
You know what that does to me.

14:19.817 --> 14:21.235
Now what are you doing?

14:21.318 --> 14:22.319
I'm nibbling.

14:24.071 --> 14:26.156
You're wiggling and nibbling?

14:26.240 --> 14:27.575
It's called wibbling.

14:29.451 --> 14:32.121
Well, your wibbling has me wobbling.
[giggles]

14:33.455 --> 14:35.124
Fernando, I'm serious.

14:35.207 --> 14:36.834
They don't want you moving in.

14:36.917 --> 14:39.587
In time, DJ and Stephanie
will grow to love me

14:39.670 --> 14:41.589
because I am an acquired taste.

14:43.424 --> 14:44.842
Like bleu cheese dressing.

14:46.135 --> 14:47.595
Or public television.

14:50.055 --> 14:51.432
Don't make me beg

14:51.515 --> 14:53.726
like a PBS pledge drive.

14:56.604 --> 14:57.980
This is so unfair.

14:58.606 --> 15:01.442
I have homework
and school doesn't start till Monday.

15:02.443 --> 15:04.737
Well, at least you got a summer break.

15:04.820 --> 15:07.323
I had to work all day every day,

15:07.406 --> 15:09.450
sometimes on the weekends.

15:09.533 --> 15:10.367
Mom.

15:10.451 --> 15:11.952
We're talking about me.

15:14.288 --> 15:15.247
Right.

15:15.706 --> 15:19.001
But, you know, Max,
this is a pretty cool project.

15:19.084 --> 15:22.212
It's called,
"One Kid Can Make a Difference."

15:22.296 --> 15:25.424
You're supposed to pick a problem
facing the world from this list

15:25.507 --> 15:26.550
and help solve it.

15:27.801 --> 15:32.389
So I have to get rid of global warming,
unsafe drinking water,

15:32.473 --> 15:36.226
plastic pollution,
government corruption...

15:38.187 --> 15:40.105

That was rad-adj.

16:00.334 --> 16:01.377
Rad-adj?

16:01.460 --> 16:02.962
As in rad-adjacent.

16:04.505 --> 16:08.342
Ah. Well, it's just a new tune I'm playing
around with. Kimmy's inside.

16:08.425 --> 16:11.387
"Kimmy's Inside"
is a terrible name for a song.

16:12.721 --> 16:14.890
But please, finish. You sound amazing.

16:15.557 --> 16:16.558

That's crazy.

16:57.891 --> 17:01.353
I mean, especially since I'm singing
a song called "Gotta Take Love Slow."

17:01.979 --> 17:05.315
I feel like your lips are like magnets
and I'm like a refrigerator.

17:09.987 --> 17:11.321
[both] Wow.

17:11.405 --> 17:12.948
[both] I know!

17:15.075 --> 17:15.909
Jimmy?

17:15.993 --> 17:18.620
-Yo-ho! Kimmy!
-Hey!

17:19.496 --> 17:22.458
[both] Five, six, seven, eight,
and sparkle, and sparkle,

17:22.541 --> 17:23.959
and spin, and spin,

17:24.043 --> 17:25.794
and spank, spank, spank, spank.

17:25.878 --> 17:27.296
-Yes!
-[Jimmy laughs]

17:27.379 --> 17:29.298
Wait, wait, wait...

17:29.381 --> 17:31.675
Why is he galloping like a Gibbler?

17:33.135 --> 17:34.720
Because all Gibblers gallop.

17:36.096 --> 17:37.681
This is my little brother, Jimmy.

17:40.684 --> 17:42.519
I just kissed a Gibbler?

17:44.730 --> 17:46.356
You just kissed a Tanner?

17:47.483 --> 17:48.567
[both] Ew!

17:49.735 --> 17:51.695
Why didn't you tell me
you were Kimmy's brother?

17:51.779 --> 17:55.991
Well, I just figured you remembered me.
I mean, who kisses a total stranger?

17:56.825 --> 17:57.785
Stephanie.

17:59.536 --> 18:02.706
I just, I haven't seen you
since you were a scrawny little kid.

18:02.790 --> 18:05.292
-I mean, you look completely different.
-Yeah.

18:05.375 --> 18:06.502
I got a haircut.

18:07.586 --> 18:09.713
Jimmy, what are you doing back in town?

18:09.797 --> 18:13.675
Well, I was driving the RV to Portland
and then I thought, "Why?"

18:14.593 --> 18:15.427
You know?

18:15.511 --> 18:17.346
And then I thought, "Man, I'm hungry."

18:17.429 --> 18:20.891
And then I thought, "I'm gonna stop
at the Tanners' and get some free food."

18:22.017 --> 18:23.519
That's the Gibbler way.

18:23.602 --> 18:25.729
-One more time!
-[both] Five, six, seven, eight...

18:25.813 --> 18:28.273
And sparkle, and sparkle,
and spin, and spin...

18:28.357 --> 18:30.776
-[Jimmy] Come on Stephanie, get in here!
-Spank, spank,...

18:30.859 --> 18:31.860
Oh, she's leaving.

18:31.944 --> 18:35.197
-Well, how's Uncle Andy been?
-He's still allergic to shrimp.

18:35.280 --> 18:38.408
That surprises me.
That's so shellfish of him.

18:38.492 --> 18:39.618
[laughs]

18:42.079 --> 18:44.790
Mini Bro, this is gonna blow your mind.

18:46.291 --> 18:50.212
Global warming will make the seas rise
and wipe out San Francisco.

18:50.295 --> 18:51.547
Our food is full of poison.

18:55.175 --> 18:58.637
There's an island of plastic trash
the size of Texas floating in the ocean.

19:02.015 --> 19:03.392
The world is falling apart!

19:08.605 --> 19:13.068
And not to make you feel bad, but
your disposable diapers aren't helping.

19:20.617 --> 19:23.579
Hey, you guys forgot to wear
your barbecue T-shirts.

19:25.497 --> 19:27.332
Sure, let's go with "Forgot."

19:28.625 --> 19:30.502
Hello, beautiful ladies.

19:31.253 --> 19:34.339
Oh, Kimmy, did you tell Fernando
that we don't want him living here?

19:35.632 --> 19:37.509
Hola, I am right here.

19:38.635 --> 19:40.637
Yes, that's the problem.

19:42.181 --> 19:44.016
Fernando is very useful.

19:44.099 --> 19:45.893
He can reach things on the top shelf.

19:47.144 --> 19:48.061
We have a ladder.

19:49.062 --> 19:51.273
I can fend off intruders.

19:52.357 --> 19:53.984
You're the intruder.

19:54.818 --> 19:55.736
[doorbell]

19:55.819 --> 19:56.778
-I'll get it.
-No.

19:56.862 --> 19:59.031
Someone who actually lives here
will get it.

20:02.201 --> 20:05.954
Hi, DJ, Kimmy. I want you guys
to meet my new girlfriend, Crystal.

20:06.038 --> 20:08.081
Oh, gosh, it's so nice meeting you.

20:08.165 --> 20:10.334
I've heard so many
good things about you from Matt.

20:10.417 --> 20:13.295
Oh, and I've heard nothing about you.

20:15.589 --> 20:18.508
Like how young and fit you are.

20:20.135 --> 20:20.969
Me?

20:21.053 --> 20:22.012
Look at you!

20:23.472 --> 20:25.891
But I could help your posture.

20:25.974 --> 20:28.477
If I could just organize your pubic bone.

20:28.560 --> 20:30.520
Oh, no, no. We just met. We just--

20:30.604 --> 20:32.105
[cracking]

20:32.189 --> 20:34.358
Oh, actually, that does feel better.

20:35.776 --> 20:36.985
Do me! Do me!

20:38.570 --> 20:41.198
Hey, DJ. Meet my girlfriend, CJ.

20:44.409 --> 20:45.953
Her name is CJ?

20:46.745 --> 20:48.080
What are the odds of that?

20:49.498 --> 20:52.584
My real name is Connie Jane,
but everyone calls me Ceej.

20:54.419 --> 20:55.712
Small world, huh, Deej?

20:56.755 --> 20:58.423
Do you mind if I give you a hug?

20:58.507 --> 21:00.384
I come from a family of huggers.

21:01.051 --> 21:03.220
OK, this is getting weird.

21:04.096 --> 21:06.306
You know what else is weird?
You guys are both doctors.

21:06.390 --> 21:09.768
Only you work on, you know, hamsters and
stuff and she works on real people, but...

21:11.270 --> 21:12.938
Steve, stop boasting.

21:13.021 --> 21:14.064
Holy Rolaids.

21:16.066 --> 21:17.609
Oh, Mylanta.

21:20.195 --> 21:23.073
Son of a Tums,
you both swear with antacids.

21:24.283 --> 21:25.826
You know, maybe I have a type.

21:28.245 --> 21:29.204
You think?

21:30.789 --> 21:32.958
Well, hey, as long as we're
getting to know each other,

21:33.041 --> 21:35.544
Crystal teaches something called
Cirque du Pilates.

21:35.627 --> 21:36.545
Show them.

21:36.628 --> 21:38.964
-Are you sure? I mean...
-Yeah, do your tricks.

21:39.047 --> 21:40.924
OK, it is really roomy in here.

21:43.969 --> 21:45.095
Oops...

21:45.762 --> 21:46.680
This is fun.

21:49.141 --> 21:50.350
She has a lot of energy.

21:51.893 --> 21:54.604
Well, I'd better get in there.
There's a lobster with my name on it.

21:54.688 --> 21:57.816
Literally, I wrote "Steve H" on its tail,
so everybody just back off.

21:57.899 --> 21:59.985
[CJ laughs]

22:00.861 --> 22:03.363
Oh. Hey, thank you for having me.

22:03.447 --> 22:06.366
I feel like we're gonna be great friends.

22:06.450 --> 22:08.035
[CJ laughs]

22:08.118 --> 22:11.246
[sighs] Sorry, I just...
I love to hug, Deej.

22:14.666 --> 22:19.838
[sighs] You know, I hate to say it,
but I really like their girlfriends.

22:19.921 --> 22:21.089
They're so nice.

22:21.173 --> 22:23.550
Well, they may be nice, but you're nicer.

22:24.760 --> 22:27.179
And they may be pretty,
but you're prettier.

22:27.763 --> 22:29.514
And they may be young, but you're...

22:32.768 --> 22:35.520
The truth is,
I just wish I had a boyfriend.

22:35.604 --> 22:37.355
At least for the next couple of hours.

22:37.439 --> 22:39.399
Well, I might be able to help with that.

22:39.483 --> 22:41.485
What? No, Kimmy, wait.
What are you thinking?

22:41.568 --> 22:42.861
-Just follow.
-Kimmy...

22:43.695 --> 22:46.281
[chattering]

22:46.907 --> 22:50.285
Hey, Jimmy. I want you
to pretend to be DJ's boyfriend.

22:51.870 --> 22:52.996
Whoa.

22:53.830 --> 22:55.123
That is not a good idea.

22:55.207 --> 22:57.209
You're right. It's a great idea.

22:58.418 --> 23:00.378
Look at those happy couples over there.

23:00.462 --> 23:03.381
So then I said,
"In that case, I'll take it to go!"

23:03.465 --> 23:04.966
[all laugh hysterically]

23:08.261 --> 23:11.807
Don't you deserve to pretend to be
as happy as those people actually are?

23:15.227 --> 23:16.228
OK, fine.

23:16.311 --> 23:19.189
I'll pretend that Jimmy is my boyfriend.

23:19.272 --> 23:20.899
But I really like Steph.

23:20.982 --> 23:23.819
I mean, what if you fall for me real hard?

23:26.279 --> 23:27.572
I think we're safe.

23:28.115 --> 23:29.741
Come with me.

23:29.825 --> 23:30.659
Come on.

23:31.785 --> 23:33.829
[Kimmy clears throat]

23:33.912 --> 23:35.038
Attention, everybody.

23:35.122 --> 23:37.749
DJ would like to introduce you
to her new boyfriend.

23:38.333 --> 23:39.417
DJ has a new boyfriend?

23:41.711 --> 23:44.881
Yeah, so I guess this is my new man,
Jimmy Gibbler.

23:47.092 --> 23:49.302
Let's give them a nice Bay Area welcome.

23:53.515 --> 23:55.892
Thank you, San Francisco.

23:57.144 --> 23:59.020
You're really dating a Gibbler?

23:59.104 --> 24:02.858
Hey, anyone would be lucky
to have a Gibbler.

24:04.818 --> 24:08.321
They are the sexiest creatures
to ever strut the Earth.

24:09.990 --> 24:10.824
It's true.

24:10.907 --> 24:13.535
Watch me walk past any construction site.

24:13.618 --> 24:14.911
Pandemonium.

24:16.746 --> 24:18.832
DJ and I love to scuba.

24:22.377 --> 24:24.713
Yes, we love to scuba.

24:25.213 --> 24:29.384
With the rubber suits and the...
Riding dolphins in the ocean.

24:29.885 --> 24:31.344
Right, big guy?

24:31.428 --> 24:32.929
You... You know it, big momma.

24:37.184 --> 24:39.477
Hey, look who's up from his nap?

24:40.061 --> 24:42.898
Stephanie, this is not what it looks like.

24:43.607 --> 24:45.859
Uh, well, it looks like a barbecue.

24:47.152 --> 24:50.864
DJ, I'm sorry.
It's been a beautiful two minutes.

24:50.947 --> 24:54.826
But I just... I feel like
we're drifting apart, you know?

24:54.910 --> 24:56.161
I have to break up with you.

24:56.912 --> 24:58.038
[all inhale with shock]

24:59.206 --> 25:01.917
Yes, people, it's true.
I'm crazy about Stephanie.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.376
[all inhale with shock]

25:04.544 --> 25:08.173
I've had a huge crush on you,
ever since we were little kids.

25:08.256 --> 25:10.383
I mean, one of my
all time favorite memories

25:10.467 --> 25:14.095
is you were playing guitar
and then I came into the back yard,

25:14.179 --> 25:15.597
and then we kissed.

25:16.264 --> 25:18.099
Uh, that was like half an hour ago.

25:19.601 --> 25:21.895
And I think about that moment
all the time.

25:22.771 --> 25:25.690
And if that's your baby,
I'll raise him as my own.

25:26.816 --> 25:28.485
Actually, that's my baby.

25:28.568 --> 25:30.195
[all inhale with shock]

25:30.278 --> 25:33.740
Oh, calm down, guys.
We already knew that.

25:37.702 --> 25:39.496
You poor thing.

25:39.829 --> 25:41.998
Your sister stole your man.

25:42.082 --> 25:45.085
So what? Does she look humiliated?

25:45.794 --> 25:47.045
Well, a little.

25:48.171 --> 25:49.172
But if I know DJ,

25:49.256 --> 25:52.592
she's on her way to the wharf right now
to pick up three new boyfriends.

25:54.970 --> 25:56.388
I'm standing right here.

25:58.139 --> 25:59.057
That's right.

25:59.140 --> 26:00.350
Make them come to you.

26:02.686 --> 26:07.107
OK, I'm just gonna take a break
and think about my poor life decisions.

26:07.190 --> 26:08.066
Good times!

26:13.405 --> 26:14.739
That's pretty uncool, man.

26:14.823 --> 26:16.283
Way uncool, man.

26:17.200 --> 26:18.118
I know.

26:18.201 --> 26:20.537
I wish I could go back in time
and change things,

26:20.620 --> 26:23.540
but that's not the way time works,
as I understand it.

26:27.919 --> 26:29.296
Hey, guys. What did I miss?

26:29.379 --> 26:32.882
Your uncle hooked up
with your mom's best friend,

26:32.966 --> 26:35.343
then left her for her sister,

26:35.427 --> 26:38.305
although, to be fair,
DJ never told him she had a baby.

26:39.889 --> 26:43.435
Hey, Lola! Here comes Action Jackson!

26:43.518 --> 26:45.520
[howls like Tarzan]

26:45.604 --> 26:47.689
Oh, oh, no. [screams]

26:52.319 --> 26:54.029
[Jackson] Don't worry, Lola. I'm OK.

26:54.112 --> 26:56.406
Lola left ten minutes ago.

26:58.116 --> 27:00.368
Yeah. It's probably for the best.

27:02.996 --> 27:05.999
Hey, Max. Why aren't you at the barbecue?

27:12.672 --> 27:14.716
[sadly] What's the point of a barbecue?

27:15.383 --> 27:16.885
What's the point of anything?

27:18.845 --> 27:20.096
What's wrong, buddy?

27:21.973 --> 27:23.391
Everything.

27:23.475 --> 27:26.019
How can one little kid make a difference

27:26.102 --> 27:27.937
when our problems are so big?

27:29.898 --> 27:31.358
We're doomed.

27:32.650 --> 27:38.239
The whole world is poisoned,
polluted and way too hot.

27:39.991 --> 27:41.493
Because we ruined it.

27:42.827 --> 27:44.204
Well, you ruined it.

27:45.872 --> 27:46.831
I'm only eight.

27:48.583 --> 27:50.585
Yeah, we did mess it up pretty good.

27:50.668 --> 27:53.463
But we could still make it better.

27:53.546 --> 27:57.217
You know, just because we made mistakes,
it doesn't mean we can't fix them.

27:58.009 --> 28:01.429
Unless, let's say, you spent
the whole summer obsessed with yourself,

28:01.513 --> 28:04.557
and let two great guys get away.

28:04.641 --> 28:09.396
[sighs] I'm never gonna find
anyone as good as Matt or Steve.

28:09.479 --> 28:12.065
I'm gonna be single
for the rest of my life.

28:12.565 --> 28:16.069
I might as well start adopting cats
and stop washing my hair.

28:17.821 --> 28:19.406
Worst pep talk ever.

28:22.784 --> 28:24.911
[Max] Mom. Tommy's walking.

28:25.537 --> 28:26.413
All by himself.

28:26.496 --> 28:27.330
[gasps]

28:28.915 --> 28:30.041
Tommy!

28:30.125 --> 28:32.335
You did it! Yes!

28:33.294 --> 28:34.295
Oh!

28:35.046 --> 28:36.089
Hey!

28:36.172 --> 28:37.465
[all] Hey.

28:39.050 --> 28:40.260
We wanted you to see this.

28:40.343 --> 28:42.137
Did you see that, Max?

28:42.220 --> 28:46.015
No matter how many times Tommy fell,
he never gave up.

28:46.099 --> 28:48.268
That right there is the human spirit.

28:48.351 --> 28:50.019
So we can't give up either.

28:50.103 --> 28:54.149
We have to keep searching
for ways to stop climate change and,

28:54.232 --> 28:55.442
and achieve world peace

28:55.525 --> 28:57.777
and plot my revenge
against Matt and Steve,

28:57.861 --> 28:59.320
and end poverty.

28:59.404 --> 29:02.991
And have universal healthcare
and fair elections.

29:03.074 --> 29:04.784
And have a relationship with Lola.

29:04.868 --> 29:06.786
And finally focus on my music career.

29:06.870 --> 29:08.747
And become a really awesome dancer.

29:09.289 --> 29:11.166
And figure things out with Fernando.

29:12.041 --> 29:15.628
And find a nice throw rug
that pulls my new room together.

29:17.255 --> 29:19.716
You don't officially live here.

29:20.675 --> 29:22.510
You know you love me.

29:23.511 --> 29:25.180
Everybody, group hug.

29:26.347 --> 29:27.348
And you're wet.
