WEBVTT

00:01.402 --> 00:03.471
It's time to take a stand
with The Gifted.

00:03.504 --> 00:06.006
-People need something
to believe in.
-Ahh!

00:06.040 --> 00:08.076
Catch all-new episodes Tuesdays.

00:08.109 --> 00:09.977
And check out
our other Fox programs--

00:10.010 --> 00:11.579
9-1-1, The Resident,

00:11.612 --> 00:12.880
and Lethal Weapon.

00:12.913 --> 00:15.749
-Hey, partner.
-Only on Fox.

00:17.017 --> 00:19.887
-(screaming)
-REEVA: We're disabling

00:19.920 --> 00:21.989
every collar at every prison.

00:22.022 --> 00:24.925
Today the uprising
truly begins.

00:26.427 --> 00:27.661
Evangeline, you got
to give me something.

00:27.695 --> 00:29.497
There is a mutant. Goes by Erg.

00:29.530 --> 00:30.731
Lives in the tunnels under D.C.

00:30.764 --> 00:32.533
You are welcome
to stay here, but

00:32.566 --> 00:34.535
you must take the mark.

00:34.568 --> 00:36.870
ECLIPSE:
Clarice and Erg--

00:36.904 --> 00:38.839
-I saw something between them.
-BLINK: Come on.

00:38.872 --> 00:40.007
You really think
I'm cheating on you?

00:40.040 --> 00:41.409
I don't know what I think
anymore.

00:41.442 --> 00:43.377
It's John--
the Purifiers took him.

00:43.411 --> 00:44.778
(grunting)

00:44.812 --> 00:46.580
JACE: We are gonna start
a citizen militia

00:46.614 --> 00:48.516
to take our safety
into our own hands.

00:48.549 --> 00:50.050
-(gun chamber clicks, gunshot)
-(grunting)

00:50.084 --> 00:52.086
(gunfire)

00:52.786 --> 00:53.954
(screaming)

00:53.987 --> 00:55.756
You ready to go home?

00:55.789 --> 00:57.925
LAUREN:
Think of everything

00:57.958 --> 00:59.460
Andrea and Andreas von Strucker
did as Fenris.

00:59.493 --> 01:02.062
The von Strucker twins
are murderers.

01:02.096 --> 01:03.397
That has nothing to do with you.

01:03.431 --> 01:04.632
I really hope so.

01:04.665 --> 01:07.235
This belonged
to Andrea von Strucker.

01:07.268 --> 01:09.803
I think you should have it.

01:13.607 --> 01:16.009
(door bell tinkles)

01:17.945 --> 01:20.148
(door creaks shut,
door bell tinkles)

01:20.181 --> 01:23.651
Picking up a custom order.
Andreas von Strucker.

01:23.684 --> 01:26.520
Mr. von Strucker. Of course.

01:28.689 --> 01:31.159
I was able to do the restoration

01:31.192 --> 01:34.662
and perform the...
modification you requested,

01:34.695 --> 01:37.465
but I'm wondering

01:37.498 --> 01:40.901
if I might be able to tempt you
into selling the instrument?

01:40.934 --> 01:43.971
This belonged to someone
who was very close to me,

01:44.004 --> 01:45.906
who I recently lost.

01:45.939 --> 01:48.909
It was like losing a piece
of my soul.

01:48.942 --> 01:50.978
All our dreams,

01:51.011 --> 01:54.448
everything we wanted
for our people are in that box.

01:54.482 --> 01:56.684
Mr. von Strucker...

01:56.717 --> 01:58.419
It's not for sale.

01:58.452 --> 02:00.288
Well...

02:00.321 --> 02:02.656
I had to try.

02:02.690 --> 02:05.159
The modification--
it's completed?

02:05.193 --> 02:07.127
Yes, it's quite remarkable.

02:07.161 --> 02:10.264
And I can assure you,
the secret is safe with me.

02:10.298 --> 02:12.366
Indeed.

02:27.248 --> 02:30.050
(Schubert's "Erlking" playing)

02:42.363 --> 02:44.732
Ever since we got back

02:44.765 --> 02:47.301
from rescuing John,
she's been like this.

02:47.335 --> 02:50.238
She's training and studying.

02:50.271 --> 02:52.340
Okay.

02:52.373 --> 02:54.375
Isn't that a good thing?

02:54.408 --> 02:56.577
She just seems different.

02:56.610 --> 02:58.312
I'm concerned that fighting

02:58.346 --> 03:00.981
alongside Andy
has affected her somehow.

03:01.014 --> 03:02.983
Of course it did.

03:03.016 --> 03:05.719
She saw him try
to kill somebody.

03:05.753 --> 03:08.689
It's not just that.

03:08.722 --> 03:10.824
She's obsessed
with that music box.

03:10.858 --> 03:13.527
-With Fenris.
-She'll be okay.

03:13.561 --> 03:17.431
Look, if-if we're really gonna
bring down the Inner Circle,

03:17.465 --> 03:19.066
she needs to be ready.

03:19.099 --> 03:20.934
Come on.

03:20.968 --> 03:22.970
Clarice and Marcos are waiting.

03:27.908 --> 03:30.911
ECLIPSE: We can't attack Reeva
right now.

03:30.944 --> 03:33.881
You all saw what the Inner
Circle is doing to our son.

03:33.914 --> 03:36.384
We have to stop them
before it's too late.

03:36.417 --> 03:38.719
You really think fighting them
is gonna bring him back?

03:39.953 --> 03:41.289
John's still sedated

03:41.322 --> 03:43.891
after taking a pound of buckshot
to the chest

03:43.924 --> 03:47.261
and you want to start a war?
Like, with the four of us?

03:47.295 --> 03:48.596
ECLIPSE:
No, Clarice is right.

03:48.629 --> 03:50.130
Security is insane.

03:50.163 --> 03:52.266
And the Frosts
can see us coming.

03:52.300 --> 03:53.967
And Reeva's powers alone will...

03:54.001 --> 03:56.770
-Okay, so we call for help.
-That might be hard to come by.

03:56.804 --> 03:58.939
The Inner Circle just freed
thousands

03:58.972 --> 04:00.474
of violent mutant criminals.

04:00.508 --> 04:01.909
People are scared.

04:01.942 --> 04:04.278
All the more reason to act now.

04:04.312 --> 04:06.614
Rally the Underground
before it's gone.

04:06.647 --> 04:08.882
Well, a lot of the stations
have gone dark.

04:08.916 --> 04:10.384
We haven't had contact in days.

04:10.418 --> 04:11.885
If they won't answer
their phones,

04:11.919 --> 04:13.621
we bang down their doors.

04:15.255 --> 04:19.493
Make them understand.

04:25.198 --> 04:26.834
Okay.

04:26.867 --> 04:29.136
I'll drive out to a couple
of stations tomorrow,

04:29.169 --> 04:30.671
see what I can turn up.

04:30.704 --> 04:32.673
None of us want to give up.

04:32.706 --> 04:34.842
We just need to be smart.

04:48.188 --> 04:50.190
(knocking)

04:51.291 --> 04:53.461
Hey. You got to check it out.

04:53.494 --> 04:55.529
Reeva's got some new people
down in the training room.

04:55.563 --> 04:57.097
New people?
What-what new people?

04:57.130 --> 04:59.132
I guess they were in prison,
and they escaped

04:59.166 --> 05:01.201
when we turned the collars off,
but they're badass.

05:01.234 --> 05:02.636
Come on,
they're about to start.

05:06.340 --> 05:08.376
REEVA:
You're not in prison anymore.

05:08.409 --> 05:11.645
We are offering you
an opportunity.

05:11.679 --> 05:13.547
To join us.

05:13.581 --> 05:16.684
To leave your past behind

05:16.717 --> 05:19.720
and become a part of something
much larger than yourselves.

05:19.753 --> 05:21.855
This is your opportunity

05:21.889 --> 05:24.825
to become the founders
of a nation,

05:24.858 --> 05:26.827
-to help to create...
-You know, there's nothing

05:26.860 --> 05:28.996
I like more
than a good civics lesson,

05:29.029 --> 05:31.098
but word is we're gonna be
getting our hands dirty.

05:34.502 --> 05:36.537
Close your eyes.

05:39.707 --> 05:43.911
Think of every human
who has ever done you wrong.

05:43.944 --> 05:46.079
I'm liking this so far.

05:46.113 --> 05:48.348
Now imagine the world
without them.

05:48.382 --> 05:50.250
HEATHER:
Sounds good to me, Max.

05:50.283 --> 05:51.585
When do we start?

05:51.619 --> 05:53.554
After your training.

05:53.587 --> 05:54.855
Training?

05:56.790 --> 05:58.392
Who needs training?

06:17.978 --> 06:21.715
(singing high tone)

06:34.762 --> 06:36.730
(laughs)

06:36.764 --> 06:38.198
I am sorry. (laughs)

06:38.231 --> 06:39.633
Let me be clear.

06:39.667 --> 06:41.234
This is my house.

06:41.268 --> 06:43.537
These are my rules.

06:43.571 --> 06:45.573
And what we're planning
requires far more

06:45.606 --> 06:48.275
than just... blowing up chairs.

06:48.308 --> 06:49.610
I need discipline.

06:49.643 --> 06:51.579
I need commitment.

06:51.612 --> 06:54.114
Unless you have other plans.

06:54.147 --> 06:55.983
Maybe you'd rather go back
to wearing a collar?

06:56.016 --> 06:57.785
Because that can be arranged.

07:03.957 --> 07:05.459
Beats prison.

07:05.493 --> 07:07.528
We're in.

07:17.137 --> 07:19.039
Did you see that?
That was awesome.

07:20.107 --> 07:22.109
I saw it.

07:25.045 --> 07:27.748
RYAN: Mutant apologists
want to gloss over

07:27.781 --> 07:29.282
the real danger these
escaped prisoners present.

07:29.316 --> 07:31.351
They're preying on our wives...

07:31.384 --> 07:33.353
Lorna. How are you?

07:33.386 --> 07:36.289
I need to talk to you
about these new recruits.

07:36.323 --> 07:38.358
Did you think
I wouldn't recognize them?

07:38.391 --> 07:41.194
This is the crew that took down
the Ignavus cruise ship.

07:41.228 --> 07:43.430
Thousands of people died.
They're mass murderers.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.866
RYAN: We can no longer
let political correctness

07:45.899 --> 07:48.168
trump the safety of decent,
hardworking human citizens.

07:48.201 --> 07:50.638
We must defend our right...

07:50.671 --> 07:52.706
How do you think
nations are founded?

07:52.740 --> 07:54.942
You took down that Trask plane.

07:54.975 --> 07:57.010
-You should understand.
-No. I...

07:58.712 --> 08:00.981
I understand collateral damage,

08:01.014 --> 08:03.383
but the thousands of people
on that ship, they were...

08:03.416 --> 08:06.386
-Innocent?
-RYAN: 330%.

08:06.419 --> 08:09.289
These animals--
and let's be honest, folks,

08:09.322 --> 08:11.491
that's exactly
what they are, animals--

08:11.525 --> 08:14.628
they're stalking our
neighborhoods, our streets.

08:14.662 --> 08:18.031
Membership in the Purifiers
is up over 70%.

08:18.065 --> 08:20.734
Every single person without
an X-Gene is a potential soldier

08:20.768 --> 08:25.505
in their army, and that is why
these new recruits are here.

08:25.539 --> 08:28.041
To hit the humans
with such force,

08:28.075 --> 08:31.378
so hard, that they will be
too scared to fight.

08:31.411 --> 08:33.480
And in the meantime,

08:33.513 --> 08:35.916
I'm out?

08:41.855 --> 08:44.024
You are royalty.

08:44.057 --> 08:47.327
Their job is to destroy.

08:47.360 --> 08:51.398
Yours is to build
from the ashes.

08:55.703 --> 08:57.838
You will see.

08:57.871 --> 08:59.907
Your time will come.

09:12.319 --> 09:14.454
I would never
advocate violence.

09:14.487 --> 09:16.857
But I will stand
for the rights of anyone

09:16.890 --> 09:19.226
who feels the need
to defend their lives

09:19.259 --> 09:22.362
or their family's lives
from a mutant attack.

09:22.395 --> 09:25.899
Until next time, friends,
stay vigilant.

09:25.933 --> 09:28.135
Stay safe.

09:30.738 --> 09:33.073
-(door opens)
-Mr. Turner,

09:33.106 --> 09:34.875
thank you for coming
to see me so quickly.

09:34.908 --> 09:37.244
Absolutely.
Listen, we need

09:37.277 --> 09:39.179
-to talk about what happened.
-In my office.

09:42.149 --> 09:44.752
JACE: The mutants that
supposedly died in Atlanta

09:44.785 --> 09:47.587
are alive. They're the ones that
attacked the Purifier compound.

09:47.621 --> 09:50.824
-We need to get it out there.
-This is our moment.

09:50.858 --> 09:52.492
We can't get distracted
by personal vendettas.

09:52.525 --> 09:54.061
No, it's...

09:54.094 --> 09:56.596
I just signed divorce papers
with my wife.

09:56.630 --> 09:58.966
She thought I was crazy
for thinking they were alive.

09:58.999 --> 10:00.467
I know you've sacrificed,
Turner.

10:00.500 --> 10:02.770
I want your sacrifice to matter.

10:02.803 --> 10:05.806
Americans are worried
about the 6,000 mutant criminals

10:05.839 --> 10:07.641
loose in their backyards.

10:10.343 --> 10:13.080
I'm offering you a chance
to be a hero.

10:13.113 --> 10:16.650
Make America safe.

10:16.684 --> 10:18.585
Isn't that what you want?

10:18.618 --> 10:20.587
Of course it is.

10:20.620 --> 10:23.523
Good. 'Cause we need to keep
the citizen militias out there,

10:23.556 --> 10:25.458
showing the people
that the Purifiers are

10:25.492 --> 10:27.094
part of the solution.

10:27.127 --> 10:29.763
Showing people they can stand up
to the mutant menace.

10:29.797 --> 10:32.332
Once we win over
America's hearts,

10:32.365 --> 10:34.868
then we can talk about Atlanta.

10:39.339 --> 10:41.308
(music box playing
the "Erlking")

10:44.344 --> 10:46.680
(sighs)

10:55.222 --> 10:57.224
(gunfire)

10:57.257 --> 10:59.259
(shouting in distance)

11:12.105 --> 11:13.540
(gunfire continues)

11:19.780 --> 11:22.082
-(gunshot)
-(gasps)

11:22.115 --> 11:23.250
Andrea!

11:23.283 --> 11:24.852
(groaning)

11:25.886 --> 11:28.521
Andreas.

11:30.123 --> 11:32.225
-(panting)

11:33.727 --> 11:34.895
Lauren?

11:34.928 --> 11:36.063
(grunts)

11:40.700 --> 11:43.436
(exhales)

11:43.470 --> 11:44.571
(gasps)

11:49.142 --> 11:50.610
(screaming)

11:54.714 --> 11:57.684
-(screams)
-Oh, God. It's all right.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.086
You're safe now.

11:59.119 --> 12:01.721
Just breathe.

12:01.755 --> 12:03.490
(exhales)

12:07.828 --> 12:09.196
CAITLIN:
Your heart rate's down.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.231
You sure you're not hurt?

12:12.265 --> 12:14.401
I'm fine. I promise.

12:14.434 --> 12:16.804
Never seen your powers
behave that way before.

12:16.837 --> 12:19.639
What you did to the dresser
and the lamp.

12:19.672 --> 12:21.308
In the dream, was Andy...

12:21.341 --> 12:24.778
It wasn't with Andy.

12:24.812 --> 12:28.748
Well, if it wasn't with Andy,
what was it?

12:32.185 --> 12:35.622
I... don't remember.

12:37.290 --> 12:39.659
(knocking)

12:41.261 --> 12:43.997
You guys stay here.
I'll get that.

12:46.834 --> 12:48.969
Hey. Mr. Rael.

12:49.002 --> 12:51.004
-Everything okay?
-You tell me.

12:51.038 --> 12:53.640
I got calls from your neighbors
about noise.

12:53.673 --> 12:55.075
Right.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.476
My-my daughter,

12:56.509 --> 12:57.777
she had a seizure.

12:57.811 --> 12:59.179
She's doing better now,

12:59.212 --> 13:00.680
but we'll try
and keep the noise down.

13:00.713 --> 13:02.615
-Okay, thanks.
-Could I...

13:02.649 --> 13:04.151
get a word, privately?

13:04.184 --> 13:06.219
Of course.

13:08.055 --> 13:11.024
This isn't the first time
we've had issues.

13:11.058 --> 13:13.160
I see the news,
and they are cracking down

13:13.193 --> 13:14.661
on landlords renting to...

13:14.694 --> 13:16.930
My daughter's sick, Art.

13:16.964 --> 13:18.131
That's all.

13:18.165 --> 13:20.133
I just...

13:20.167 --> 13:21.601
I need to be sure.

13:21.634 --> 13:22.802
I know.

13:22.836 --> 13:24.471
It's a scary time.

13:24.504 --> 13:26.373
-You have a nice day.
-All right.

13:26.406 --> 13:27.707
And tell, uh...

13:27.740 --> 13:28.708
Lila, right?

13:28.741 --> 13:30.643
My daughter? Lila, yeah.

13:30.677 --> 13:32.479
Well, tell Lila
I hope she feels better.

13:32.512 --> 13:33.513
Thanks. Thanks, Art.

13:41.721 --> 13:44.157
All right, a couple sightings
reported in Columbia Heights.

13:44.191 --> 13:45.492
-You guys head over there.
-MAN: What do you want us

13:45.525 --> 13:46.559
-to hit first?
-Jace.

13:46.593 --> 13:48.128
Check the churches

13:48.161 --> 13:49.162
and the shelters, all right?

13:49.196 --> 13:50.230
Keep your eyes and ears open.

13:50.263 --> 13:51.331
-Hey.
-MAN: All right, you heard him.

13:51.364 --> 13:52.332
Let's load it up.

13:52.365 --> 13:53.733
What's up, man?

13:53.766 --> 13:55.068
What the hell is going on?

13:55.102 --> 13:56.336
I had a little, uh...

13:56.369 --> 13:58.071
little chat with our friend.

13:58.105 --> 14:00.340
He wants us to hit the streets
right away.

14:00.373 --> 14:01.909
I introduced you to that friend.

14:01.942 --> 14:03.476
I built this chapter,

14:03.510 --> 14:04.978
-and all I get is a text?
-Okay, hold on,

14:05.012 --> 14:06.813
hold on, Ted.

14:06.846 --> 14:08.648
I'm not trying
to shut you out, man.

14:08.681 --> 14:11.084
And, you know, I know you got
hit pretty hard at the compound.

14:11.118 --> 14:13.053
Not just me, Jace.
Men died at that compound.

14:13.086 --> 14:14.587
Kyle may never walk again.

14:14.621 --> 14:16.089
And-and you just want
to rush right back out there.

14:16.123 --> 14:18.325
I know it's quick.
It was made very clear to me

14:18.358 --> 14:20.393
this is a top priority.
I had to move fast.

14:20.427 --> 14:22.362
I got a group
ready to go to Anacostia.

14:22.395 --> 14:23.730
There's some escaped mutants
out there.

14:23.763 --> 14:26.466
It would mean a lot to me
if you'd come.

14:28.902 --> 14:31.304
Come on.

14:37.978 --> 14:40.213
-How's he doing?
-I'm not exactly sure

14:40.247 --> 14:43.450
how he heals-- only that
it's faster than normal.

14:43.483 --> 14:45.718
I hoped he'd be better by now.

14:45.752 --> 14:47.587
(sighs)

14:47.620 --> 14:50.457
Hey, it's just taking some time.

14:50.490 --> 14:53.460
He'll be back out there
where we need him soon.

14:53.493 --> 14:56.096
Back out there
so he can get shot again.

14:56.129 --> 14:58.465
Great.

15:04.471 --> 15:08.775
When Reed first started out
as a prosecutor,

15:08.808 --> 15:12.445
he was put on
an organized crime case.

15:12.479 --> 15:14.114
And during the trial,

15:14.147 --> 15:16.216
one day,
his car wouldn't start.

15:16.249 --> 15:19.886
So, we called AAA.

15:19.919 --> 15:22.589
And they found a bomb.

15:23.856 --> 15:27.260
Basically, he... lived

15:27.294 --> 15:30.097
because he bought
a lousy car battery.

15:30.130 --> 15:32.832
Afterwards, I-I begged him
to go into private practice

15:32.865 --> 15:34.267
or just...

15:34.301 --> 15:36.503
transfer divisions, but...

15:37.537 --> 15:40.173
...he said he had to go back.

15:40.207 --> 15:43.243
Look, I have been married
for 20 years.

15:43.276 --> 15:45.645
People bend, they adapt,

15:45.678 --> 15:48.281
but...

15:48.315 --> 15:50.850
they don't change.

15:50.883 --> 15:53.486
This is who John is

15:53.520 --> 15:57.090
and who the world
needs him to be.

15:57.124 --> 15:59.993
Yeah, but what about
what I need him to be?

16:00.027 --> 16:02.629
You love each other.

16:02.662 --> 16:04.664
It's gonna be okay.

16:07.334 --> 16:10.003
(phone buzzing)

16:10.037 --> 16:11.704
Marcos.

16:11.738 --> 16:14.107
-How's it going?
-Well, not great.

16:14.141 --> 16:15.942
The leaders of the Dover station
fled for Canada.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.144
There's a couple
of mutants left,

16:17.177 --> 16:18.445
but they got no combat powers

16:18.478 --> 16:20.013
and even less interest
in fighting.

16:20.047 --> 16:21.648
It's not good,
but it's not over.

16:21.681 --> 16:23.450
-I've still got
a few more stops.
-All right.

16:23.483 --> 16:24.551
Be careful.

16:35.395 --> 16:37.397
(grunts)

16:37.430 --> 16:38.898
(chuckles)

16:38.931 --> 16:40.633
(squeaking)

16:40.667 --> 16:43.536
Yeah, you got to be kidding me.

16:59.052 --> 17:01.020
Lorna, what is this?

17:01.054 --> 17:03.090
I need your help.

17:03.123 --> 17:05.158
So you carjack me?

17:05.192 --> 17:06.493
-Okay, will you just listen?
-No, no,

17:06.526 --> 17:08.195
it's time that you listen!

17:08.228 --> 17:11.731
You decided to leave me
for the Inner Circle.

17:11.764 --> 17:13.400
And you decided
that I didn't get to be there

17:13.433 --> 17:14.767
when Dawn was born.

17:14.801 --> 17:17.670
And then you decided
to give her away.

17:17.704 --> 17:21.408
And then you decided
to kiss me out of nowhere

17:21.441 --> 17:24.611
and then leave again.

17:24.644 --> 17:26.613
Enough.

17:26.646 --> 17:29.182
-Lorna, enough.
-Look, I'm not here to talk

17:29.216 --> 17:31.684
about us, Marcos. I'm here
'cause I need your help. Please.

17:31.718 --> 17:33.853
I know how you feel.

17:33.886 --> 17:36.423
I know you hate me right now.

17:36.456 --> 17:38.057
It's Reeva, okay?

17:38.091 --> 17:40.793
She's planning something.
Something terrible.

17:40.827 --> 17:42.929
(chuckles)
Seriously?

17:42.962 --> 17:44.431
What, your, uh...

17:44.464 --> 17:46.433
your race war isn't turning out
like you'd hoped?

17:48.668 --> 17:50.270
Marcos, she has the team

17:50.303 --> 17:52.605
from the Ignavus
cruise ship massacre.

17:52.639 --> 17:54.974
They murdered thousands.

17:55.007 --> 17:58.411
I knew that a mutant homeland
would mean sacrifice,

17:58.445 --> 18:02.315
but I was willing to kill or die
for that dream.

18:02.349 --> 18:04.817
But there are lines.
There have to be.

18:04.851 --> 18:08.188
Marcos, these new recruits,
they killed families.

18:09.689 --> 18:11.958
Children.

18:11.991 --> 18:14.427
Reeva looked me in the eye
and told me that's why

18:14.461 --> 18:16.629
she needed them, because
she wants to do something

18:16.663 --> 18:19.466
so monstrous that it changes
the world forever.

18:19.499 --> 18:21.668
I need to stop her.

18:21.701 --> 18:25.338
I... I can't do that by myself.

18:29.209 --> 18:31.311
I'm sorry.

18:31.344 --> 18:34.981
Okay? I'm sorry.
How I treated you was wrong.

18:35.014 --> 18:37.517
And if you don't want
to forgive me, fine, don't.

18:37.550 --> 18:39.919
But you help me.
You help me, Marcos Diaz.

18:39.952 --> 18:43.356
You help me because you are too
good of a man to let people die

18:43.390 --> 18:46.326
just 'cause I suck at love.

18:57.170 --> 18:59.038
BLINK:
Wow.

18:59.071 --> 19:01.274
My mind
is completely blown.

19:01.308 --> 19:03.176
Lorna's actually turning
on the Inner Circle?

19:03.210 --> 19:05.945
Yeah. I know.
It was a leap for me, too.

19:05.978 --> 19:07.847
Do you want the understatement
of the year award

19:07.880 --> 19:10.550
-sent to your house?
-You know what scares me?

19:10.583 --> 19:14.153
Whatever Reeva's doing is bad
enough to change Lorna's mind.

19:16.055 --> 19:18.024
So what are we gonna do?

19:18.057 --> 19:20.727
I was thinking
we go to the Morlocks.

19:20.760 --> 19:23.963
Oh. This just keeps getting
better and better.

19:23.996 --> 19:25.665
You want to go to the Morlocks?

19:25.698 --> 19:27.367
The last I checked,
you called me a traitor

19:27.400 --> 19:28.835
-for even talking to them.
-We need to figure out

19:28.868 --> 19:30.537
what's happening
in the Inner Circle,

19:30.570 --> 19:32.539
and they have eyes
all over the city.

19:32.572 --> 19:33.973
They're the only ones.

19:34.006 --> 19:36.676
You're unbelievable.

19:37.910 --> 19:39.646
REED:
You saw what I saw.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.314
She's obsessed
with that music box.

19:41.348 --> 19:42.849
Her powers are changing.

19:42.882 --> 19:46.018
She's becoming more violent,
more powerful.

19:46.052 --> 19:48.421
Maybe that's not entirely bad.

19:48.455 --> 19:49.889
I-If Lauren's stronger...

19:49.922 --> 19:51.991
Andy went down this same path.

19:52.024 --> 19:55.562
He was obsessed with
my family history, the power.

19:55.595 --> 19:56.863
Andy was brainwashed.

19:56.896 --> 20:00.500
(sighs)

20:00.533 --> 20:03.270
The song that's playing
on the music box--

20:03.303 --> 20:05.004
it's called the "Erlking."

20:05.037 --> 20:08.741
It's about an evil force
that steals children...

20:11.110 --> 20:14.046
...and the parents
who ignore it.

20:16.916 --> 20:19.386
(scoffs)

20:22.289 --> 20:23.890
MAN:
Keep your eyes open.

20:23.923 --> 20:26.025
You two go ahead.

20:26.058 --> 20:29.061
-What is this place?
-It's a youth shelter.

20:29.095 --> 20:31.798
Got some reports about escaped
criminals posing as homeless.

20:31.831 --> 20:34.033
I'll be damned if I'm gonna
let 'em endanger kids.

20:34.066 --> 20:37.570
We got any hard intel?
I-If this is all just fishing...

20:37.604 --> 20:39.406
Hey, who doesn't love fishing?

20:39.439 --> 20:41.040
MAN 2:
I got eyes on 'em right here.

20:41.073 --> 20:42.742
This is a safe space for
homeless youth. You-you cannot

20:42.775 --> 20:45.077
-just barge in here.
-People saw some fugitives
around here.

20:45.111 --> 20:47.547
-We just need to take a look.
-Yeah. A bunch of guys
with guns?

20:47.580 --> 20:49.115
I-If you were cops
with a warrant,

20:49.148 --> 20:50.750
-maybe, but...
-WILSON: Hey-hey, slow down.

20:50.783 --> 20:53.219
I'm an off duty officer.
This is a public place.

20:53.252 --> 20:55.154
The guns are licensed.
We have every right to be here.

20:55.187 --> 20:57.089
Hey.

20:57.123 --> 20:58.558
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:58.591 --> 20:59.959
-Hey!
-ADMINISTRATOR:
You can't go up there.

20:59.992 --> 21:01.294
-Hey!
-BOY: What's going on?

21:01.328 --> 21:02.895
Those kids haven't done
anything wrong!

21:02.929 --> 21:04.130
Somebody call the cops!

21:05.498 --> 21:07.334
-That's my stuff, man.
-This way! Quick!

21:07.367 --> 21:09.469
(indistinct shouting)

21:11.771 --> 21:13.239
BOY:
Who are these people?

21:13.272 --> 21:15.241
-In here!
-Here!

21:15.274 --> 21:17.276
(residents shouting)

21:22.849 --> 21:25.618
No, no! You better hope your
power's faster than a bullet,

21:25.652 --> 21:27.019
'cause I will shoot you.

21:27.053 --> 21:28.254
Don't do anything stupid.

21:28.287 --> 21:29.922
We just have a few questions.

21:29.956 --> 21:32.425
JACE:
There you go.

21:32.459 --> 21:34.727
There you go.

21:38.631 --> 21:41.000
Any sense of when
I get to hear you admit

21:41.033 --> 21:42.369
you're the world's
biggest hypocrite?

21:42.402 --> 21:44.103
Look, what do you want me
to say?

21:44.136 --> 21:45.505
Feel free to make it your own,
but any version

21:45.538 --> 21:47.206
of "I was wrong, Clarice,

21:47.239 --> 21:49.208
I'm a total jerk"
would be great.

21:49.241 --> 21:51.110
We're trying to stop
a terror attack here, okay?

21:51.143 --> 21:52.845
So you can't even apologize?

21:52.879 --> 21:54.981
I mean, you love pointing out
everyone else's flaws.

21:55.014 --> 21:56.983
When you went
behind my back to John

21:57.016 --> 21:59.018
to talk about me
and this place...

22:00.252 --> 22:03.790
Damn, you hurt me.
And him.

22:03.823 --> 22:06.626
I'm sorry, Clarice. You know,
I've got my own issues.

22:06.659 --> 22:08.861
This whole thing with Lorna,
I'm-I'm really struggling

22:08.895 --> 22:10.329
to make sense of it.

22:13.165 --> 22:15.568
I am sorry.

22:17.169 --> 22:19.138
Apology accepted.

22:19.171 --> 22:20.573
(door opens)

22:20.607 --> 22:23.009
Now, suck it up.
It's game time.

22:23.042 --> 22:24.477
Got the message you were
coming down, Blink.

22:24.511 --> 22:25.712
What's going on?

22:25.745 --> 22:28.347
Uh, Blink?
You're Blink now?

22:28.381 --> 22:31.183
Yeah, I am, Eclipse.
Relax.

22:31.217 --> 22:33.986
-You brought him?
-I'm regretting it.

22:34.020 --> 22:35.187
I need to talk to you.

22:35.221 --> 22:36.255
I wouldn't come down here

22:36.288 --> 22:37.256
unless it was important.

22:37.289 --> 22:38.891
Please, just hear me out.

22:41.461 --> 22:42.529
Come.

22:43.763 --> 22:45.297
(Eclipse groans)

22:47.366 --> 22:48.835
Nice to see you again.

22:48.868 --> 22:52.772
You never call, you never text.

22:52.805 --> 22:54.507
I'm sorry.

22:54.541 --> 22:57.109
The service down here
is terrible.

22:57.143 --> 22:59.546
* Get read' to run
like a fugitive or pugilist *

22:59.579 --> 23:00.780
* Track with Thunny B... *

23:00.813 --> 23:03.683
Cheers, man.

23:03.716 --> 23:07.186
(sighs)

23:07.219 --> 23:09.756
Mm.

23:11.157 --> 23:14.126
Great work at training today.

23:14.160 --> 23:17.296
Oh, that?
Come on, that was nothing.

23:17.329 --> 23:19.732
You should have seen the boom
when I busted out of the joint.

23:19.766 --> 23:21.768
(imitates explosion)

23:23.770 --> 23:27.373
I'm still, uh,
still working the kinks out.

23:27.406 --> 23:28.575
Mm.

23:28.608 --> 23:30.977
You took down
the Ignavus cruise ship.

23:31.010 --> 23:33.713
So, that's... legendary.

23:33.746 --> 23:35.414
You're Lorna Dane, right?

23:35.448 --> 23:37.484
Yeah, your pops was,
like, my hero

23:37.517 --> 23:39.486
when I was a kid.
Now, that dude,

23:39.519 --> 23:41.387
that dude was an OG.

23:41.420 --> 23:45.224
Yeah. You probably knew him
better than I did, but thanks.

23:45.257 --> 23:47.894
So, what's Reeva got you doing?

23:47.927 --> 23:49.896
Well, Sentinel Services
had us in

23:49.929 --> 23:51.998
three separate hellholes.

23:52.031 --> 23:54.233
We haven't seen each other
in years.

23:54.266 --> 23:56.168
Just getting back in the groove.

23:56.202 --> 23:57.770
I mean, I'm just curious

23:57.804 --> 24:00.172
when I get to see the legend
in action.

24:00.206 --> 24:02.709
You must have some idea
of what you're hitting.

24:06.979 --> 24:09.616
Do you want to know the secret

24:09.649 --> 24:12.952
to my long
and illustrious career?

24:12.985 --> 24:15.187
As long as I get paid,

24:15.221 --> 24:18.224
I don't ask any questions.

24:23.663 --> 24:25.364
(sighs)

24:39.011 --> 24:40.713
(soft chuckle)

24:40.747 --> 24:44.216
Somebody steal our
bottle opener?

24:44.250 --> 24:47.820
Oh. Sorry, I know I shouldn't be
using my powers inside.

24:47.854 --> 24:50.356
Oh. Well, that's probably not
the best idea,

24:50.389 --> 24:53.626
but you're working on
getting better.

24:53.660 --> 24:56.262
It's pretty cool.

24:59.365 --> 25:02.334
Your father
is concerned about you.

25:05.404 --> 25:07.006
I know.

25:07.039 --> 25:08.541
I like getting stronger

25:08.575 --> 25:12.144
and learning
about my family, but...

25:12.178 --> 25:14.080
it's overwhelming sometimes.

25:14.113 --> 25:16.382
But I'm beginning to feel
if we're gonna win this fight,

25:16.415 --> 25:18.551
we can't take anything
off the table.

25:18.585 --> 25:20.252
-(engine revs)
-MAN: Completely spread out.

25:20.286 --> 25:21.320
(indistinct chatter)

25:21.353 --> 25:22.889
CAITLIN:
What is it?

25:22.922 --> 25:25.091
(siren whoops)

25:25.124 --> 25:26.392
(indistinct radio transmission)

25:26.425 --> 25:29.161
Watch your back, all right?

25:29.195 --> 25:30.362
It's the police.

25:35.534 --> 25:37.269
(indistinct chatter)

25:37.303 --> 25:39.205
Cait.
How many were there?

25:39.238 --> 25:40.539
Two came inside our building.

25:40.573 --> 25:42.208
(banging on door)

25:42.241 --> 25:44.110
-You go in the bedroom,
I'll handle it.
-No, Reed,

25:44.143 --> 25:46.412
if they see the destruction
in Lauren's room...

25:46.445 --> 25:47.847
-(banging on door)
-OFFICER: Police! Open the door!

25:47.880 --> 25:50.817
-Go. I'll take care of it.
-All right.

25:56.923 --> 25:58.390
Good afternoon, offic...

25:58.424 --> 25:59.859
-Palms and eyes to the ground.
-You can't just come...

25:59.892 --> 26:02.528
-Hands and palms
to the floor now.
-We got a report

26:02.561 --> 26:05.297
-of mutant activity in the area.
-Slowly and carefully
reach into your pocket

26:05.331 --> 26:06.465
-and hand us your ID.
-You can't just

26:06.498 --> 26:08.400
come into my home without
a search warrant.

26:08.434 --> 26:10.502
I can if I've got
probable cause.

26:13.606 --> 26:14.607
I just heard a crash.

26:16.776 --> 26:18.711
Get ready.

26:18.745 --> 26:20.046
There's nowhere to escape.

26:20.079 --> 26:21.914
Lauren, if it comes to it,
I need you to do

26:21.948 --> 26:23.950
whatever you can
to get us out of here.

26:23.983 --> 26:25.551
We are not leaving in cuffs.

26:25.584 --> 26:26.786
(indistinct chatter)

26:29.021 --> 26:31.090
Okay, I got an idea.

26:31.123 --> 26:32.825
Go out there and tell them that
you saw mutants in the street,

26:32.859 --> 26:34.426
that you think they're
going to attack.

26:34.460 --> 26:36.963
OFFICER:
Reach into your pocket
and show me your ID.

26:36.996 --> 26:38.464
REED:
It's right there on the table,
in my wallet.

26:38.497 --> 26:40.166
There, in the bowl.

26:40.199 --> 26:41.801
DISPATCHER:
Go ahead.

26:41.834 --> 26:44.270
Dispatch, I need you to run
an ID check for me.

26:44.303 --> 26:46.505
-What are you doing?
-Hands and eyes to the ground!

26:46.538 --> 26:48.675
-Honey, do what he says!
-No. He's in here

26:48.708 --> 26:52.611
harassing you while these muties
terrorize our neighborhood.

26:52.645 --> 26:54.814
-What are you talking about?
-Are you blind?

26:54.847 --> 26:56.783
There are mutants
out on the street right now,

26:56.816 --> 27:00.052
and you're in here pointing your
guns at innocent humans?

27:06.659 --> 27:08.127
POLICEMAN:
Look out!

27:10.963 --> 27:13.165
-Did you see where it came from?
-10-80-M.

27:13.199 --> 27:14.433
OFFICER:
I repeat, 10-80-M.

27:14.466 --> 27:16.202
Requesting
immediate assistance.

27:16.235 --> 27:18.270
There.
What did I tell you?

27:18.304 --> 27:20.873
-10-4. 20 on suspect?
-Negative. They're looking.

27:23.409 --> 27:25.211
-(glass shatters)
-Over there!

27:25.244 --> 27:27.479
(indistinct shouting)

27:27.513 --> 27:29.215
DISPATCH:
Suspect believed heading east

27:29.248 --> 27:30.482
down west alley. 11-99.

27:30.516 --> 27:33.352
10-4. En route.
Let's go.

27:36.856 --> 27:39.692
So, you're actually
enjoying this?

27:39.726 --> 27:42.461
Yeah. Been teaching
some of the kids.

27:42.494 --> 27:44.030
Feels good to be needed again.

27:45.431 --> 27:46.999
I'm getting used to it.

27:47.033 --> 27:48.835
-The mark.
-I'm sorry.

27:48.868 --> 27:51.470
I just feel bad for bringing you
down here and making you...

27:51.503 --> 27:55.174
Hey. You did so much.

27:55.207 --> 27:58.277
The sacrifices you make
to help mutants in trouble--

28:00.780 --> 28:02.014
Can I, uh...?

28:02.048 --> 28:04.683
Yeah.

28:26.438 --> 28:27.406
I'm sorry.

28:27.439 --> 28:29.909
I...

28:29.942 --> 28:31.277
(stifled laugh)

28:31.310 --> 28:34.013
It's your ex, isn't it?

28:34.046 --> 28:37.116
The one you told me about.
You still have feelings for her?

28:37.149 --> 28:39.852
Uh, it's-it's a lot more
complicated than that.

28:39.886 --> 28:43.422
No, I, uh...
She treated me like garbage,

28:43.455 --> 28:45.624
and she tore the world
to pieces,

28:45.657 --> 28:49.295
and now she's asking me to help
her put it back together.

28:49.328 --> 28:50.729
You know, when I think
about her, I just...

28:50.763 --> 28:54.300
I feel sad and... and angry.

28:54.333 --> 28:56.635
I, uh, I wish I was stronger.

28:56.668 --> 28:59.872
You can only be that angry
at someone you love.

28:59.906 --> 29:03.375
It doesn't take strength
to hate someone.

29:03.409 --> 29:04.844
It takes strength
to forgive them.

29:10.950 --> 29:13.319
-(kids laughing)
-BLINK: The Inner Circle's
up to something big.

29:13.352 --> 29:15.054
We need to know what.

29:15.087 --> 29:17.790
What you're asking--
it's no small thing.

29:17.824 --> 29:19.458
I know, I get that.

29:19.491 --> 29:21.727
You don't care about
the people up there...

29:21.760 --> 29:24.496
-Is that what you think?
That I don't care?
-Well, yeah.

29:24.530 --> 29:27.333
I mean, you're always talking
about "the people above."

29:27.366 --> 29:29.501
(laughs)

29:31.470 --> 29:33.505
I wasn't born in a tunnel.

29:35.808 --> 29:39.011
But when I came here, I made
a commitment to this place.

29:39.045 --> 29:42.815
My first priority
is to protect them.

29:44.616 --> 29:46.785
As I would protect you...

29:49.021 --> 29:51.457
...if you chose to join us.

29:55.527 --> 29:57.663
I-I can't.

29:57.696 --> 30:00.532
They need me up there.

30:00.566 --> 30:03.302
I won't let people die

30:03.335 --> 30:05.337
because I did nothing.

30:09.008 --> 30:11.410
I can't fight your war, Blink.

30:13.745 --> 30:16.382
But there is something
I can give you.

30:18.517 --> 30:21.653
So, what, you haven't
seen anything?

30:21.687 --> 30:24.623
Yes. I don't know anything
about no escaped mutants.

30:24.656 --> 30:26.558
All right.
Then why'd you run?

30:26.592 --> 30:28.160
You know who runs?

30:28.194 --> 30:29.962
People with something to hide.

30:29.996 --> 30:31.030
You're not the cops.

30:31.063 --> 30:33.632
-You can't tell me...
-Just... (sighs)

30:33.665 --> 30:36.035
Just tell me what I want to
know, and we can both move on...

30:36.068 --> 30:38.604
-I swear, I don't know anything.
-Then why did you run?

30:41.007 --> 30:42.574
Because you're Purifiers.

30:42.608 --> 30:44.243
Y'all are like the Klan.

30:44.276 --> 30:46.478
My granddaddy didn't need
a reason to run from the Klan.

30:46.512 --> 30:47.947
Neither did yours.

30:56.956 --> 30:59.591
Look, kid...

30:59.625 --> 31:01.727
this isn't about hate.

31:01.760 --> 31:03.495
I don't have a problem
with mutants

31:03.529 --> 31:04.997
if they're following the law.

31:05.031 --> 31:06.198
I don't.

31:06.232 --> 31:08.067
-I just...
-(gunshot)

31:10.402 --> 31:12.471
(kid gasping)

31:13.805 --> 31:15.107
What happened?

31:17.576 --> 31:18.844
Ted, what the hell happened?

31:18.877 --> 31:20.846
He was-he was using his powers.

31:20.879 --> 31:22.348
He-he-he lifted his hands.

31:22.381 --> 31:24.816
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

31:26.285 --> 31:28.054
We need an ambulance here now!

31:28.087 --> 31:29.488
Somebody call an ambulance!

31:45.171 --> 31:47.506
What did you do?

31:48.607 --> 31:49.908
Ted.

31:49.942 --> 31:52.244
What did you do?

31:52.278 --> 31:54.746
I don't know.

31:54.780 --> 31:56.548
It just happened.

31:56.582 --> 31:58.317
You shot a kid in the chest.
That doesn't just happen.

31:58.350 --> 32:00.419
I was afraid for my life.

32:00.452 --> 32:03.089
He came at me, and I-I...

32:03.122 --> 32:06.292
There's blood all over the back
of his chair, Ted.

32:06.325 --> 32:08.127
Like he was sitting down.

32:10.529 --> 32:12.231
Jace, I don't-I don't know
what to say.

32:12.264 --> 32:14.166
How did he come at you
if he was sitting down?

32:14.200 --> 32:15.834
I didn't even want to be here!

32:17.636 --> 32:20.306
(sirens approaching)

32:20.339 --> 32:21.740
I'm gonna be a cop in prison.

32:21.773 --> 32:24.376
Do you know what that means?

32:26.278 --> 32:28.247
JACE:
We had info that some
escaped fugitives

32:28.280 --> 32:30.816
came through here, so...

32:30.849 --> 32:34.453
I know why you're here.
I'm asking what happened.

32:34.486 --> 32:37.489
I got a dead kid,
a shooter who isn't talking.

32:37.523 --> 32:39.125
I need anything you can give me.

32:40.859 --> 32:43.162
(police radio chatter)

32:50.902 --> 32:52.971
Did you see anything or not?

33:00.346 --> 33:03.549
I heard a commotion, I came
in the room, I saw the kid...

33:05.551 --> 33:08.220
...looking like he was
ready to attack,

33:08.254 --> 33:11.590
and Officer Wilson
stood his ground.

33:14.760 --> 33:16.595
All right, then.

33:23.335 --> 33:24.403
Why were they here?

33:24.436 --> 33:25.737
Do you think
the building manager

33:25.771 --> 33:27.373
-said something?
-We'll get back to that.

33:27.406 --> 33:29.141
What matters right now
is that you used your powers

33:29.175 --> 33:30.742
and you could have been seen,
you could have been heard.

33:30.776 --> 33:32.378
I told her to do it, Reed.

33:32.411 --> 33:34.346
And it worked.

33:34.380 --> 33:35.547
So this was your idea?

33:35.581 --> 33:38.650
If they searched the apartment,
we would all be in jail.

33:38.684 --> 33:40.386
We talked about this.

33:40.419 --> 33:41.753
We talked about the music box,
we talked about all of it.

33:41.787 --> 33:43.655
I thought we were
on the same page here, Cait.

33:43.689 --> 33:47.393
No. You decided we needed
to be on your page.

33:47.426 --> 33:48.994
We are not holding Lauren back.

33:49.027 --> 33:50.262
Not now.

33:51.297 --> 33:53.432
There is too much at stake.

33:55.401 --> 33:57.136
I can handle this.

33:59.571 --> 34:01.107
(door opens)

34:01.140 --> 34:03.209
POLARIS:
I can only stay for a second.

34:03.242 --> 34:05.177
-They'll notice I'm gone soon.
-(door closes)

34:05.211 --> 34:07.713
Did you find out
what Reeva's planning?

34:07.746 --> 34:10.082
Not yet. Either no one knows
what the attack plan is,

34:10.116 --> 34:12.251
or no one's saying.

34:12.284 --> 34:15.421
What about you?

34:15.454 --> 34:16.922
I'm not sure.

34:17.956 --> 34:19.958
Well, what is it?
Did you find something?

34:19.991 --> 34:21.260
Clarice and I got a tip

34:21.293 --> 34:23.595
about something at a train yard.

34:23.629 --> 34:25.897
The Morlocks say someone swept
all of the security.

34:25.931 --> 34:27.699
It's probably nothing.

34:27.733 --> 34:28.934
I'll check it out

34:28.967 --> 34:30.369
-and I'll let you know.
-Wait.

34:30.402 --> 34:31.603
If there's something,
I should go.

34:31.637 --> 34:33.805
-Lorna, it's not...
-Look.

34:35.807 --> 34:38.744
We are in this situation
because of me.

34:41.413 --> 34:42.981
It's my fault.

34:45.016 --> 34:47.085
-I treated you terribly.
-(breath catches)

34:49.788 --> 34:51.390
Uh...

34:51.423 --> 34:54.593
I've been waiting so long
to hear those words.

34:56.027 --> 34:58.730
I've been so angry
for so long.

34:58.764 --> 35:01.333
About losing you, about...

35:01.367 --> 35:03.635
about losing our family.

35:03.669 --> 35:07.239
And I keep... wondering
when I'll crack.

35:07.273 --> 35:10.008
When I'll... when I'll give up.

35:13.845 --> 35:15.914
And then I don't.

35:15.947 --> 35:18.284
Why can't I?

35:18.317 --> 35:20.286
I don't know.

35:20.319 --> 35:23.121
I just want you to be safe.

35:25.724 --> 35:28.360
(cries softly)

35:30.796 --> 35:33.665
Look...

35:33.699 --> 35:35.467
all I ever wanted...

35:37.536 --> 35:40.105
...was a place for us.

35:40.138 --> 35:42.908
You, me...

35:43.975 --> 35:45.411
and Dawn.

35:49.215 --> 35:51.483
And I know-I know
you think I gave up on you.

35:51.517 --> 35:53.452
I understand why.

35:53.485 --> 35:56.622
But you have to know...

35:56.655 --> 35:58.089
you have to know that I never...

36:00.259 --> 36:01.527
...never did.

36:36.462 --> 36:37.996
RYAN: We're talking about
an incident today

36:38.029 --> 36:39.931
where our citizen militia
had to stop

36:39.965 --> 36:42.268
a dangerous mutant by force.

36:42.301 --> 36:44.069
Folks...

36:44.102 --> 36:45.904
this wasn't even
one of the escaped prisoners.

36:45.937 --> 36:49.007
This animal was in a homeless
shelter for children.

36:49.040 --> 36:51.176
What would have happened
if Jace Turner and Ted Wi...

36:51.209 --> 36:52.711
(TV clicks off)

36:56.282 --> 36:57.883
(phone vibrates)

37:07.493 --> 37:08.994
(clears throat)

37:12.798 --> 37:14.566
Paula.

37:14.600 --> 37:17.102
Hey, Jace.
Can you talk?

37:19.638 --> 37:23.442
Yeah... yeah.

37:23.475 --> 37:25.744
Well, um...

37:25.777 --> 37:27.479
well, I just felt, um...

37:27.513 --> 37:29.080
I-I had to call.

37:29.114 --> 37:30.616
I've been...

37:30.649 --> 37:32.951
watching The Ryan Hour.

37:32.984 --> 37:35.253
Really?

37:35.287 --> 37:37.255
I thought-I thought
you hated that show.

37:37.289 --> 37:40.526
What you did--
saving those kids...

37:43.094 --> 37:45.297
Grace would be proud of you.

37:45.331 --> 37:49.000
Yeah, I don't know
about that, baby, I'm...

37:49.034 --> 37:50.436
I don't know.

37:50.469 --> 37:52.438
I know it's hard.

37:52.471 --> 37:54.540
Maybe... if we saw each other?

37:56.608 --> 37:57.843
Paula.

38:00.712 --> 38:03.248
I love you.

38:03.281 --> 38:06.585
I love you... but I got to go.

38:06.618 --> 38:08.153
-Jace...
-(hangs up)

38:16.061 --> 38:18.430
I was out long enough
for you to learn how to cook?

38:18.464 --> 38:20.532
Long enough for me
to learn how to open a can.

38:20.566 --> 38:22.468
I don't know why
they just don't have lids

38:22.501 --> 38:24.636
like all the other containers.

38:24.670 --> 38:26.405
Be normal, cans.

38:28.474 --> 38:30.008
-(Zingo whines)
-Hey, um...

38:32.578 --> 38:35.080
...when I was in that room,
with the Purifiers...

38:37.015 --> 38:38.350
I kept thinking about you.

38:38.384 --> 38:41.887
What I said...
about you and Erg.

38:41.920 --> 38:44.556
-John, we don't have
to talk about this right now.
-No, no, okay?

38:44.590 --> 38:45.857
It's important, okay?

38:47.759 --> 38:50.328
I-I lost Pulse...

38:50.362 --> 38:52.731
and I lost Dreamer and...

38:52.764 --> 38:54.533
it's hard for me...

38:54.566 --> 38:56.735
to be this close with someone.

38:56.768 --> 38:58.670
I get scared...

39:00.706 --> 39:02.674
...to lose someone else
that I love.

39:06.745 --> 39:08.013
I, uh...

39:16.522 --> 39:20.158
John, I don't want
to lose you, too.

39:20.191 --> 39:22.027
I'm scared. It's...

39:23.562 --> 39:25.397
(phone vibrates)

39:26.932 --> 39:28.767
(sighs)

39:31.903 --> 39:33.539
-Hello.
-EVANGELINE: John.

39:33.572 --> 39:34.773
It's Evangeline.

39:34.806 --> 39:36.007
I'm gathering the regional
leaders of the

39:36.041 --> 39:38.477
-Underground for a meeting.
-Wh-When?

39:39.911 --> 39:41.947
We're working out the details.

39:41.980 --> 39:44.349
John, I should have listened
to you in Philadelphia.

39:44.382 --> 39:46.117
You were right.
The Underground is collapsing.

39:46.151 --> 39:47.619
We can't let that happen.

39:47.653 --> 39:50.656
I'm calling to tell you:
gather your people.

39:51.890 --> 39:53.391
Be ready.

39:55.393 --> 39:57.295
-What?
-It was Evangeline.

39:57.328 --> 39:59.598
She's gathering the Underground.

39:59.631 --> 40:01.433
To fight.

40:02.668 --> 40:04.002
(short chuckle)

40:16.347 --> 40:18.450
(energy whirring)

40:34.600 --> 40:36.602
(Andreas speaking German)

41:10.401 --> 41:11.837
(knocking)

41:14.005 --> 41:15.473
Lila.

41:15.507 --> 41:17.275
Nice to see
you're feeling better.

41:17.308 --> 41:19.645
What can I do for you?

41:19.678 --> 41:22.514
The police stopped by today.

41:22.548 --> 41:26.051
They've just been performing
random spot checks

41:26.084 --> 41:27.385
because of the prison breaks.

41:27.418 --> 41:29.555
They only came to our apartment.

41:31.489 --> 41:34.660
Maybe... one of the neighbors,
because of the noise.

41:37.195 --> 41:40.331
The neighbors who heard
the noise called you.

41:40.365 --> 41:43.902
I just wanted to make sure
there weren't mutants.

41:43.935 --> 41:47.505
Well, there are mutants,
Mr. Rael.

41:47.539 --> 41:49.007
Like me.

41:49.040 --> 41:50.542
And if you ever

41:50.576 --> 41:53.745
come after my family again...

41:55.581 --> 41:57.348
Oh, my Go...

42:00.185 --> 42:03.054
There will be consequences.

42:03.088 --> 42:05.256
And if you talk...

42:05.290 --> 42:07.192
to anyone...

42:07.225 --> 42:10.528
I-I won't say anything,
I swear to God!

42:10.562 --> 42:11.930
I know you won't.

42:11.963 --> 42:13.832
Because in this world,

42:13.865 --> 42:15.567
anyone could be a mutant.

42:15.601 --> 42:17.435
You don't know who they are.

42:17.468 --> 42:19.204
You're never...

42:20.872 --> 42:22.741
...safe.

42:22.774 --> 42:24.776
(train whistle blows)

42:26.712 --> 42:28.714
POLARIS:
We've been waiting
out here for hours.

42:28.747 --> 42:30.582
Do you think Erg
made a mistake?

42:30.616 --> 42:32.250
ECLIPSE:
He told Clarice someone wiped

42:32.283 --> 42:34.119
all the security in the area.

42:34.152 --> 42:35.887
This has got to be Reeva.

42:35.921 --> 42:37.522
I still don't get it.

42:37.555 --> 42:40.091
I mean, the Inner Circle
is the most secure place

42:40.125 --> 42:42.127
I've ever seen.

42:42.160 --> 42:44.395
There's no reason to come here.

42:44.429 --> 42:45.797
Unless Reeva's doing something

42:45.831 --> 42:47.498
she doesn't want
anyone else to know.

42:56.808 --> 42:58.076
Who is that?

43:08.654 --> 43:10.088
That's Benedict Ryan.

43:10.121 --> 43:11.456
From Hawk News.

43:11.489 --> 43:13.591
The anti-mutant crusader.

43:13.625 --> 43:15.426
What is Reeva doing
with Benedict Ryan?

43:24.770 --> 43:26.504
I don't know.

44:07.578 --> 44:09.547
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

44:11.883 --> 44:14.019
It's time to pick a side
on The Gifted.

44:14.052 --> 44:16.354
Here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

44:18.757 --> 44:20.558
Welcome to the galaxy.

44:21.760 --> 44:23.729
Should be fun. I'll lead.

44:25.563 --> 44:28.466
* We're breaking waves
Shooting stars *

44:28.499 --> 44:29.835
We're gonna make a run for it.

44:29.868 --> 44:31.069
* Live for glory, not forever *

44:31.102 --> 44:35.540
-Go!
-* Reach out *

44:35.573 --> 44:39.144
* Make this right here
Right now *

44:39.177 --> 44:42.914
* Stand up *

44:42.948 --> 44:45.717
-* Here right now *
-Now!
