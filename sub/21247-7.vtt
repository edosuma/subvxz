10:58.342 --> 11:01.376
Beshte!

11:02.279 --> 11:05.146
Beshte!

11:05.182 --> 11:07.315
Oh, yeah.
That's much less annoying.

11:07.351 --> 11:08.983
(SNIFFING)

11:09.019 --> 11:11.219
Beshte!

11:11.254 --> 11:13.188
Beshte!

11:17.094 --> 11:19.127
It don't matter what he says.

11:19.162 --> 11:22.163
You two always gotta
listen to me.

11:22.199 --> 11:23.998
You got it, boss.

11:24.034 --> 11:25.300
What'd he say?

11:25.335 --> 11:27.235
He said, listen to me.

11:27.270 --> 11:30.338
Uh, Cheezi?
I was listening to you.

11:30.374 --> 11:33.108
Not me-me. Him-me.

11:33.143 --> 11:34.209
Who me?

11:34.244 --> 11:36.177
So sad.

11:38.048 --> 11:40.115
Psst. Ushari!

11:40.450 --> 11:42.283
I'm right here.

11:42.319 --> 11:44.419
Yeah, well, I got a secret
you might wanna know.

11:44.454 --> 11:46.121
Secret?

11:46.156 --> 11:49.391
That hippo from the Lion Guard
is stuck in the Outlands.

11:49.426 --> 11:51.226
Alone.

11:51.261 --> 11:53.061
Is he, now?

11:53.096 --> 11:56.998
Shupavu's keeping an eye
on him right now.

11:57.033 --> 11:57.999
Who cares about a hippo?

12:00.370 --> 12:02.170
I care.

12:02.205 --> 12:04.939
Oh, yeah! Yeah! I care tons!

12:04.975 --> 12:06.408
Me, too!

12:06.443 --> 12:08.109
Uh... why do we care?

12:08.145 --> 12:14.082
Because if the Lion Guard's
strongest is alone
in the Outlands,

12:14.117 --> 12:18.286
it's the perfect opportunity
to eliminate him!

12:18.989 --> 12:20.121
Yes.

12:20.157 --> 12:22.290
It will weaken the Lion Guard.

12:22.325 --> 12:24.392
Correct, Ushari.

12:24.428 --> 12:30.265
And then you hyenas will get
to eat whatever you like
in the Pride Lands.

12:32.135 --> 12:35.003
Whatever we want?
Yum!

12:35.038 --> 12:37.305
First
we gotta take out Beshte.

12:37.340 --> 12:39.240
But he's the strongest.

12:39.276 --> 12:41.443
How are we supposed
to do that, boss?

12:41.478 --> 12:45.180
Don't call me "boss"
in front of the boss.

12:45.215 --> 12:48.082
In case
you fools haven't noticed,

12:48.118 --> 12:50.084
it's the dry season.

12:50.120 --> 12:53.321
Too much sun
makes hippos weak.

12:53.356 --> 12:57.091
Since Beshte already seems
to trust you skinks,

12:57.127 --> 12:59.961
we can use that
to our advantage.

12:59.996 --> 13:01.996
I have a plan.

13:02.032 --> 13:04.966
Listen to him, boys,
he has a plan.

13:05.001 --> 13:07.202
Him you? Or Him-him?

13:07.237 --> 13:09.137
Just listen.

13:09.172 --> 13:13.074
Scar always has a plan!
Big plans!

13:14.010 --> 13:17.946
Correct. Big plans indeed.

13:17.981 --> 13:21.349
Now, here's what I want
you to do.

13:26.289 --> 13:28.223
Thanks again
for finding me shade.

13:28.258 --> 13:31.326
The Pride Lands are
all the way on the other side
of Rocky Plateau.

13:31.361 --> 13:34.362
But I don't think
I can make it across
without getting burned.

13:34.397 --> 13:36.364
I got ya covered!

13:36.399 --> 13:39.100
Literally! I know a shortcut.

13:39.135 --> 13:41.302
Through the caves
under Rocky Plateau.

13:41.338 --> 13:42.403
You do?

13:42.439 --> 13:45.173
And you're sure that's
the right way to go?

13:45.208 --> 13:46.374
Sure I'm sure.

13:46.409 --> 13:49.444
It'll keep Beshte outta
the sun so he won't burn.

13:49.479 --> 13:51.179
Trust me.

13:51.214 --> 13:54.048
That'd be<i> Poa.</i> Let's go.

13:54.084 --> 13:56.217
The cave's this way.
Follow me.

13:56.253 --> 13:59.087
Who knew folks were so helpful
in the Outlands?

13:59.122 --> 14:03.057
Lucky I found you guys.
I mean, lucky you found me.

14:03.093 --> 14:05.126
Whew! Let's go.

14:06.029 --> 14:08.229
Yes. Totally lucky.

14:12.202 --> 14:13.268
This way.

14:20.243 --> 14:22.143
This plan's gonna
He's fwork out great.(LAUGHS)

14:23.013 --> 14:25.046
I dunno, Janja.

14:25.081 --> 14:27.982
Your plans don't usually
work out so good.

14:28.018 --> 14:31.252
This ain't my plan,
fur-brain, remember?
It's Scar's.

14:31.288 --> 14:33.955
Oh, yeah, right.

14:33.990 --> 14:35.990
Then maybe it will work.

14:36.059 --> 14:37.058
Exactly!

14:37.427 --> 14:39.093
Hey!

14:39.129 --> 14:41.162
(SIGHS) Never mind.

14:41.197 --> 14:44.299
Come on, fur-brains.
Let's get over
to Rocky Plateau.

14:44.334 --> 14:46.200
We got work to do.

14:46.236 --> 14:47.368
(LAUGHING)

14:48.305 --> 14:50.038
(SNIFFING)

14:52.275 --> 14:55.109
I thought I had him,
but...

14:55.145 --> 14:58.413
(SNIFFING) Yeah,
I'm not having much luck
tracking him either.

14:58.448 --> 15:01.049
It's hard to smell
somebody's scent

15:01.084 --> 15:03.284
when it's been washed away
by so much water.

15:03.320 --> 15:06.154
(SIGHS) I hope
Ono's having better luck.

15:09.259 --> 15:11.159
Come on, Beshte...

15:11.194 --> 15:12.293
Where did you go?

15:15.031 --> 15:17.332
Those look like
Hippo prints!

15:20.136 --> 15:24.205
Of course!
Beshte went into the cave
to get out of the sun!

15:24.240 --> 15:27.342
Kion! Kion!
I know where Beshte went!

15:27.377 --> 15:30.111
You found him?
Not exactly. Just follow me.

15:33.116 --> 15:34.382
His tracks lead in here.

15:34.417 --> 15:36.017
Nice work, Ono.

15:36.052 --> 15:37.285
Whoa! Look at that!

15:37.320 --> 15:38.353
What is it?

15:38.388 --> 15:41.155
Big B...
He has really big feet!

15:41.191 --> 15:43.291
Because he's
a hippo, Bunga.

15:43.326 --> 15:44.959
Oh, yeah.

15:44.995 --> 15:47.228
Beshte must have gone in
to get shelter from the sun.

15:47.263 --> 15:48.296
Come on!

15:54.170 --> 15:56.304
So are we getting close
to the end of the caves?

15:56.339 --> 15:59.974
Oh, we're getting close
to the end, all right.
(SNICKERS)

16:00.010 --> 16:01.275
You got a plan, right?

16:01.311 --> 16:02.343
Oh, yeah.

16:05.348 --> 16:07.181
Hurry up.

16:07.217 --> 16:08.349
(INHALES) Okay.

16:10.954 --> 16:12.053
(GRUNTS)

16:12.088 --> 16:15.289
Phew!
That was a tight squeeze.

16:15.325 --> 16:19.127
Uh-oh. Hey, little skinks?

16:19.162 --> 16:21.295
I think we made
a wrong turn somewhere.

16:21.331 --> 16:22.997
This is a dead end.

16:23.033 --> 16:24.198
JANJA: You got that right!
(LAUGHS)

16:24.234 --> 16:25.266
Janja!

16:27.137 --> 16:29.404
And us!
Hello!

16:29.439 --> 16:31.406
Skinks!
You gotta get outta here!

16:31.441 --> 16:33.141
Back the way we came,
before...

16:33.176 --> 16:35.009
Now!

16:35.045 --> 16:36.244
(CHUNGU AND CHEEZI GRUNTING)

16:36.279 --> 16:37.412
Little skinks! Look out!

16:42.085 --> 16:43.084
Uh-oh.

16:43.119 --> 16:44.952
That's right! You're trapped!

16:44.988 --> 16:47.221
And we got lots more rocks
up here!

16:47.257 --> 16:49.290
(LAUGHING)

16:49.325 --> 16:51.025
But not for long!

16:54.230 --> 16:56.197
At least those
little skinks got away safe.

16:56.232 --> 16:58.332
But I thought
the skinks was with us?

16:58.368 --> 17:00.168
The hippo don't know that!

17:00.203 --> 17:02.336
Come on,
we got more rocks to push!

17:03.239 --> 17:06.040
(GRUNTING)

17:06.076 --> 17:09.343
Oh, boy! I don't think
I want to be around
when that rock hits!

17:11.014 --> 17:13.081
I just gotta unblock
the entrance.

17:13.116 --> 17:15.149
<i> Twende Kibokoooo!</i>

17:15.185 --> 17:17.351
(ECHOING)<i> Twende Kiboko...</i>

17:17.387 --> 17:18.986
ALL: Beshte!

17:20.256 --> 17:21.255
(GRUNTING)

17:27.997 --> 17:29.297
Beshte!

17:29.332 --> 17:30.998
Bunga! Not helping!

17:31.367 --> 17:32.967
Bunga?

17:33.002 --> 17:34.202
It's not, huh?

17:34.237 --> 17:36.237
Beshte,
glad to hear you're okay.

17:36.272 --> 17:38.973
Thanks, Kion. But, uh...

17:39.008 --> 17:43.144
I've kind of got a "hyenas and
falling rock" situation here.

17:43.179 --> 17:47.215
They're pushing down rocks
from an opening
to Rocky Plateau.

17:47.250 --> 17:50.017
And I'm pretty sure
they're trying to hit me!

17:50.053 --> 17:51.185
I know where that is!

17:51.221 --> 17:53.221
I flew over it while
I was looking for Beshte.

17:53.256 --> 17:56.257
Hang in there, Beshte!
We'll handle those hyenas!

17:56.292 --> 17:57.325
Okay...

17:58.294 --> 17:59.327
But hurry.

17:59.362 --> 18:01.229
I'm runnin' outta places
to go!

18:01.264 --> 18:02.897
Let's go!

18:02.932 --> 18:04.198
Till the Pride Lands end...

18:04.234 --> 18:06.067
ALL: Lion Guard defend!

18:06.102 --> 18:07.235
This way!

18:09.239 --> 18:12.273
Ono, wait!
We can't just fly up there.

18:12.308 --> 18:16.010
You can't, but I can get
pretty close to flying.
<i> Huwezi!</i>

18:18.014 --> 18:19.080
Follow her.

18:26.189 --> 18:28.389
(LAUGHING) Heh-heh. That one
hit real loud. This is fun!

18:28.424 --> 18:30.158
This is fun.

18:30.193 --> 18:33.995
Who cares how loud it is,
fur-brain? Hit the hippo!

18:34.030 --> 18:36.130
We could if he'd stop moving.

18:37.967 --> 18:41.936
Hey, Beshte. Maybe you could
hold still a second?

18:41.971 --> 18:43.037
I don't think so.

18:46.009 --> 18:47.241
Ha! He's running outta room!

18:47.277 --> 18:49.110
Now for the big one.

18:51.347 --> 18:52.413
(GRUNTING)

18:55.385 --> 18:56.384
Uh-oh.

19:00.323 --> 19:02.089
(LAUGHING)

19:02.125 --> 19:04.926
One smooshed hippo, comin' up!

19:04.961 --> 19:07.328
Not so fast, Janja!

19:07.363 --> 19:10.164
Fuli! Try to keep
that rock from falling in!

19:10.200 --> 19:11.265
On it, Kion!

19:14.037 --> 19:15.069
Totally on it.

19:16.372 --> 19:19.106
(SNARLS) Back away, Janja.

19:19.142 --> 19:21.375
Hey! Stop with the pecking!

19:23.246 --> 19:24.212
(GRUNTING)

19:28.985 --> 19:31.018
(GRUNTING)

19:31.054 --> 19:32.220
Beshte! Get out of there!

19:34.290 --> 19:36.157
<i> Twende Kiboko!</i>

19:41.130 --> 19:44.098
Thought you could hurt one
of the Lion Guard, did you?

19:44.133 --> 19:47.068
Oh? Is the hippo down there
one of the Lion Guard?

19:47.103 --> 19:49.003
I had no idea.

19:49.038 --> 19:52.340
(FORCED LAUGH)
We were just havin' some fun.

19:55.378 --> 19:58.312
So I got nowhere to run,
eh, cub?

19:58.348 --> 20:02.149
Actually, you can have all
the room you need.

20:05.054 --> 20:06.087
(ROARS)

20:12.128 --> 20:14.195
I never get tired of that.

20:14.230 --> 20:16.364
No rain this time, though.
Oh, well.

20:16.399 --> 20:19.300
Least we got rid of the hyenas
and saved Big B.

20:21.437 --> 20:23.170
Bunga!
Beshte!

20:27.143 --> 20:28.242
Big B?

20:32.382 --> 20:35.449
BESHTE: Boy, that last rock
sure was a doozy, huh?

20:36.352 --> 20:38.019
(ALL SIGH)

20:38.054 --> 20:40.321
I thought
I was gonna have to
be Big B from now on.

20:40.356 --> 20:42.189
Nah... I'm still here.

20:43.126 --> 20:44.292
(YELLING)

20:46.029 --> 20:47.261
So much for that plan.

20:47.297 --> 20:50.331
I guess Scar's plan worked out
as good as one of yours.

20:50.366 --> 20:53.034
(LAUGHING) Huh, Janja?

20:53.069 --> 20:56.103
Think he's gonna be mad?

20:56.139 --> 20:59.473
You know, maybe we don't gotta
go right back to the volcano.

20:59.509 --> 21:02.143
USHARI: Janja? Hyenas?

21:02.178 --> 21:04.211
Scar wants to see you.

21:04.247 --> 21:05.379
Now.

21:05.415 --> 21:07.281
And he's not happy.

21:11.454 --> 21:14.121
(GULPS) Oh, boy.

21:17.260 --> 21:21.262
Beshte, I'm so sorry I got you
swept into the Outlands.

21:21.297 --> 21:24.398
That's okay, Kion. It's not
like you did it on purpose.

21:24.434 --> 21:26.167
You were helping the zebras.

21:26.202 --> 21:28.202
Yeah, and it all worked out
great.

21:28.237 --> 21:31.138
Plus, we got to see all
the hyenas go flying!

21:31.174 --> 21:32.206
(CHUCKLES)

21:32.241 --> 21:34.342
Yeah, and that never
would've happened

21:34.377 --> 21:36.344
if you guys hadn't come
to look for me.

21:36.379 --> 21:38.980
You can always
count on us, Beshte.

21:39.015 --> 21:40.247
You know it, Big B.

21:40.283 --> 21:42.149
Ow.

21:42.185 --> 21:45.052
Ooh. You really did get burned
out there.

21:45.088 --> 21:47.188
Yeah. It's good to be home.

21:47.223 --> 21:49.256
Where there's lots of shade.

21:49.292 --> 21:50.358
And mud!

21:51.260 --> 21:54.328
Oh, yeah! Gotta love it!

21:55.365 --> 21:57.131
(SIGHS) Do we?

21:57.166 --> 21:58.466
(LAUGHING)
