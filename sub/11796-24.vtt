( bell rings )

00:04.170 --> 00:06.639
<i>* When I wake up in the</i>
<i>morning and the alarm</i>
<i>gives out a warning</i>

00:06.673 --> 00:09.509
<i>* I don't think</i>
<i>I'll ever make it on time</i>

00:09.542 --> 00:12.445
<i>* By the time I grab my books</i>

00:12.479 --> 00:16.181

00:16.216 --> 00:21.588
<i>* It's all right</i>

00:21.621 --> 00:24.724
<i>* If the teacher pops a test</i>

00:24.758 --> 00:27.861

<i>* It's all right</i>

01:22.882 --> 01:25.618
- Mom, I'm home!
- Mom: Hi, honey!

01:25.652 --> 01:27.520
I just got what
I wanted for Christmas.

01:27.554 --> 01:30.657
- Jessie: What's that?
- Two weeks off from school.

01:30.690 --> 01:32.759
Screech: Does that mean
I don't have to
buy you a gift?

01:32.792 --> 01:34.694
- Think again.
- He doesn't think

01:34.728 --> 01:38.865
ever since he
looked up the chimney
and Santa stepped on his head.

01:41.234 --> 01:43.837
- Do I smell cookies?
- You certainly do, Kelly.

01:43.870 --> 01:46.673
Zack helped me bake them.

01:46.706 --> 01:49.709
- You baked?
- Yeah,
I made gingerbread women.

01:49.743 --> 01:52.278
Gingerbread chicks.
I like it.

01:53.513 --> 01:57.150
For you, they should have made
gingerbread pigs.

01:57.183 --> 01:59.619
Come on, help yourselves.

02:03.857 --> 02:05.792
Hey, don't you have
any more cookie women?

02:05.825 --> 02:10.697
Why? You need a date
for New Year's Eve?

02:10.729 --> 02:14.200
Now that school's out,
how do you all
plan to spend your holidays?

02:14.234 --> 02:17.604
I needed to buy gifts for
my sisters, so I got a job
at a men's store.

02:17.637 --> 02:20.340
I didn't know your sisters
wore men's clothes.

02:20.373 --> 02:22.909
I got a job at the mall,
in Gift Wrap.

02:22.942 --> 02:27.614
Gift Wrap? Isn't that
an MC Hammer Christmas song?

02:27.647 --> 02:31.751
Slater, you know, Gift Wrap
can get pretty hectic
this time of year.

02:31.785 --> 02:35.622
Don't worry about it, Mrs. M.
I'm good at everything I do.

02:35.655 --> 02:38.825
Yeah? Not according
to the girls I talked to.

02:41.961 --> 02:44.631
- What about you, Jessie?
- I'm working at a photo booth

02:44.664 --> 02:46.966
where kids get their pictures
taken with Santa.

02:47.000 --> 02:52.272
- I didn't know
you liked children.
- I don't. I like $8 an hour!

02:52.305 --> 02:54.808
I'm volunteering
at a hospital.
I want to help cheer up kids

02:54.841 --> 02:56.409
who can't go home
for Christmas.

02:56.443 --> 02:58.812
That's very
generous of you, Lisa.

02:58.845 --> 03:02.148
Sometimes the best gifts are
the ones you can't wrap.

03:02.182 --> 03:04.751
You guys, don't forget
you promised to buy gifts

03:04.784 --> 03:07.487
for the kids at our hospital
Christmas party.

03:07.520 --> 03:10.924
And Screech,
no gifts that breathe,
lay eggs or bite!

03:18.431 --> 03:19.899
There you are.

03:19.933 --> 03:23.603
I'm sure your daughter
will love
the champagne glasses.

03:25.572 --> 03:27.941
Oops. I guess
I forgot to tape the bottom.

03:27.974 --> 03:30.543
You klutz!

03:30.577 --> 03:33.713
Ma'am,
please try to stay calm.
It's my first day here

03:33.747 --> 03:36.249
and I don't want
it to be my last...
what are you doing?

03:36.282 --> 03:40.086
It was the only set of glasses
like that in the mall!

03:40.086 --> 03:42.489
Preppie, help!

03:42.522 --> 03:46.860
Ma'am, please. I'm sure this
gentleman will be very glad
to pay for them.

03:46.893 --> 03:49.095
- The money.
- Okay.

03:49.095 --> 03:52.265
I'm sorry about this.
There you go.

03:52.298 --> 03:54.334
( gasps )
Thank you.

03:54.367 --> 03:57.637
- You okay, buddy?
- Whoa, this is some job.

03:57.671 --> 03:59.606
I'm making $4 an hour,

03:59.639 --> 04:01.641
I'm spending $40.

04:01.675 --> 04:04.711
These are for
the kids at the hospital.
Wrap them better, okay?

04:04.744 --> 04:07.580
Kids just rip it apart anyway.

04:08.848 --> 04:10.750
Okay, Tommy,
smile for Santa.

04:10.784 --> 04:14.721
- I don't want to.
- Okay,
how about smiling for me?

04:14.754 --> 04:16.055
No!

04:16.956 --> 04:18.757
Tommy, if you don't smile,

04:18.791 --> 04:21.861
I'm gonna tell Santa
not to bring
you what you want.

04:21.894 --> 04:24.664
Ow!

04:24.698 --> 04:27.467
Santa's going to get you,
little brat!

04:27.500 --> 04:30.870
Keep spreading
that Christmas cheer, Jessie.

04:30.904 --> 04:32.372
Wait till you see what
I bought for the kids!

04:32.405 --> 04:36.076
- Go get a table.
- All right.

04:36.076 --> 04:38.078
- Ow! Jeez!
- Hey,
watch where you're going!

04:38.078 --> 04:42.682
Sorry, I didn't see you.
I'm sure glad l
bumped into you.

04:42.716 --> 04:46.653
- I'm Zack Morris.
- I'm... late for work.

04:46.686 --> 04:49.389
- My lunch.
- I'm sorry.

04:49.422 --> 04:51.524
An apple?
You call this lunch?

04:51.558 --> 04:53.793
- I'm on a diet.
- Why?

04:53.827 --> 04:56.763
- You look great to me.
- I do?

04:56.796 --> 04:59.332
Well, thank you.
I got to go.

04:59.366 --> 05:01.534
- Wait,
I didn't catch your name.
- Laura. Bye!

05:01.568 --> 05:03.737
Where are you going?

05:05.505 --> 05:09.442
I don't know what
it is, but there's
something different about her.

05:09.476 --> 05:12.946
No there isn't.
Every girl in LA is on a diet.

05:13.046 --> 05:15.048
You've got to
help me find her.
She works in the mall.

05:15.048 --> 05:17.784
Okay, but first,
check out this doll.

05:17.817 --> 05:20.553
- It's called
"Squeeze and Squirt."
- Very nice.

05:20.587 --> 05:22.655
- Just have Slater wrap it.
- Not yet.

05:22.689 --> 05:25.291
First, I want
to make sure it works.

05:29.062 --> 05:31.464
I think it works.

05:31.498 --> 05:33.500
Oh my gosh!
It won't stop!

05:33.533 --> 05:36.569
- What do I do?
- I don't know.

05:36.603 --> 05:39.339
How should I know?
Take it to the bathroom,
bathroom!

05:39.372 --> 05:41.374
Good idea!
Men's or ladies'?

05:41.408 --> 05:43.076
What? Go!

05:47.380 --> 05:49.949
Hurry up, Screech,
you've got to
help me find Laura.

05:49.983 --> 05:51.985
( toilet flushes )

05:56.756 --> 05:57.991
Why did you flush the toilet?

05:58.091 --> 06:00.860
She had to go to the bathroom.

06:06.633 --> 06:10.637
- Did you have an accident,
son?
- Oh. It's not what you think.

06:10.670 --> 06:13.506
I'm potty trained.
She isn't.

06:13.540 --> 06:15.642
You want to know how to get
your pants dry in a hurry?

06:15.675 --> 06:18.378
Please. Zack won't be seen
with me in public like this.

06:18.411 --> 06:21.047
Come on over here.
Stand underneath
this hand dryer.

06:21.047 --> 06:23.416
Point the nozzle down.

06:24.651 --> 06:26.553
- Thanks for the tip.
- That's okay.

06:26.586 --> 06:28.955
I've been caught in the rain
many times.

06:29.055 --> 06:31.057
Thanks, mister!
Nice guy, huh?

06:31.057 --> 06:33.059
Let's hurry up, man.

06:35.061 --> 06:38.565
- Screech, look.
- He's shaving.

06:38.598 --> 06:40.734
Don't stare!

06:40.767 --> 06:43.737
How can I look
if I don't stare, dummy?

06:47.907 --> 06:49.709
Excuse me, are you all right?

06:49.743 --> 06:52.612
I'll be okay.
I didn't eat breakfast today.

06:52.645 --> 06:54.848
You shouldn't leave your house
without breakfast.

06:54.881 --> 06:57.751
It's the most important
meal of the day!

06:57.784 --> 06:59.652
Screech,
I think he's homeless.

06:59.686 --> 07:03.590
- Then he should eat out.
- He doesn't have
a place to live!

07:03.623 --> 07:05.492
Oh.

07:05.525 --> 07:07.394
Both: Oh!

07:09.596 --> 07:11.698
Gee, mister, I didn't know.

07:11.731 --> 07:13.733
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

07:13.767 --> 07:16.569
I've got
a bigger bathroom here
than I even did at home.

07:16.603 --> 07:18.104
You live...

07:18.138 --> 07:22.042
what I mean is...
you live here in the mall?

07:22.042 --> 07:25.845
No, I just stopped in to do
a little Christmas shaving.

07:25.879 --> 07:28.848
Kinda makes me look
like Santa Claus,
don't you think?

07:28.882 --> 07:31.785
Nah. He's fat.
He eats breakfast.

07:33.820 --> 07:36.589
We've got to go
look for the girl.

07:45.765 --> 07:48.902
- There's money in here.
- Ooh, I got dibs on it...

07:48.935 --> 07:53.073
- Is it yours, mister?
- There's no
money in there, son.

07:53.073 --> 07:55.642
I'd check again.

07:55.675 --> 07:57.444
Merry Christmas.

08:02.148 --> 08:04.384
Thanks to you, son.

08:08.722 --> 08:10.824
So you're working
to buy Christmas gifts too?

08:10.857 --> 08:15.495
No, I... I just remembered
there's another box of
sweaters in the back.

08:19.833 --> 08:21.801
Hey, Kelly.
How's it going?

08:21.835 --> 08:25.171
- Fine. What's up?
- Well,
I'm looking for a girl.

08:25.205 --> 08:28.041
Zack,
we only sell clothes here.

08:28.074 --> 08:32.178
No, it's someone I met
then l lost in the crowd.

08:32.212 --> 08:35.048
- There she is!
- You mean Laura?

08:35.048 --> 08:36.783
- Hi!
- Hi.

08:36.816 --> 08:40.186
- I've been
looking all over for you.
- Me? Why?

08:40.220 --> 08:43.590
Because I want
to take you to lunch.

08:43.623 --> 08:46.926
Hi! Zack, I looked all over,
couldn't find Laura.

08:48.061 --> 08:50.530
- Keep looking.
- Right.

08:51.631 --> 08:53.933
So, can I take you to lunch?

08:53.967 --> 08:56.803
- I brought my lunch,
remember?
- You brought an apple.

08:56.836 --> 08:59.205
So is it a date?

08:59.239 --> 09:02.609
- We just met.
- You know, Zack is my friend.

09:02.642 --> 09:06.012
He's safe if you eat
near a security guard.

09:07.514 --> 09:11.017
Hey, Zack, there's
that homeless guy again.

09:11.017 --> 09:13.887
He's homeless?
The poor man.

09:13.920 --> 09:18.658
Of course, he's poor.
That's why he's homeless.

09:18.692 --> 09:21.494
I gave him some money.
I just hope he
spends it on food.

09:21.528 --> 09:24.597
- What do you mean by that?
- When you give
a guy a handout,

09:24.631 --> 09:28.735
you can't be sure if he's
really hungry,
or a wino, or worse.

09:28.768 --> 09:30.704
So, pick you up at 1 2:30?

09:30.737 --> 09:33.239
Forget it.
I just lost my appetite.

09:42.048 --> 09:43.950
Okay,
let me get this straight.

09:44.050 --> 09:47.253
The chick dumped you
before your first date?

09:47.287 --> 09:49.255
Well...

09:49.289 --> 09:51.291
yeah.

09:51.324 --> 09:53.059
That belongs in the
"Guinness Book of Records!"

09:53.093 --> 09:56.363
- Even Screech
does better than that!
- Thanks.

09:56.396 --> 09:59.099
Look, Zack, she's probably
playing hard to get.

09:59.132 --> 10:01.768
- You think so?
- Uh-huh,
and she's good at it too.

10:01.801 --> 10:06.406
You're sitting there with
your tongue hanging out
and no lollipop to lick!

10:12.712 --> 10:16.983
Hey, Lisa, guess what
I'm wearing!

10:17.017 --> 10:18.852
- Is that mistletoe?
- Yep.

10:18.885 --> 10:22.188
- Make you want
to do anything?
- Yeah, run away.

10:25.258 --> 10:27.460
- Hi, guys.
- Hey. What's up?

10:28.395 --> 10:30.130
Kelly, you go ahead and eat.

10:30.163 --> 10:31.831
- I'll be back later.
- Laura.

10:31.865 --> 10:34.267
I'm sorry if I offended you.

10:34.300 --> 10:36.703
I really don't know much
about the homeless people.

10:36.736 --> 10:40.874
In my neighborhood,
a poor family
is one who doesn't have cable.

10:40.907 --> 10:44.044
So... please stay.

10:44.077 --> 10:46.179
You know, Zack is a good guy.

10:46.212 --> 10:48.348
Yeah, give him a break.

10:49.382 --> 10:50.784
Laura...

10:50.817 --> 10:53.219
Christmas is supposed
to be a happy time,

10:53.253 --> 10:57.190
but ever since Zack thought
he hurt you,
he's been real sad.

10:57.223 --> 11:00.427
- Who are you?
- Screech his geeky sidekick.

11:01.761 --> 11:04.097
- You're a good friend.
- You think so?

11:04.130 --> 11:06.900
- Want to go out Saturday?
- Hey!

11:06.933 --> 11:09.069
I'm going to go
get some lunch.
Do you need anything?

11:09.069 --> 11:12.872
- No, thanks.
I'm not that hungry.
- I'm sorry about that.

11:14.140 --> 11:17.077
So, tell me about yourself.

11:17.110 --> 11:19.079
You live around here?

11:19.079 --> 11:22.449
- I live with my dad.
- Oh. Where?

11:22.482 --> 11:25.185
Actually, we're in
the process of moving.

11:25.218 --> 11:27.153
We move around a lot.
Could I have a chip?

11:27.187 --> 11:29.122
- Sure.
- Thanks.

11:30.390 --> 11:34.194
Does your dad travel a lot
in his business?

11:34.227 --> 11:36.996
He's between jobs right now.

11:40.233 --> 11:42.435
I thought you said
you weren't hungry.

11:42.469 --> 11:44.838
You know what
they say about chips.

11:44.871 --> 11:46.806
Oh sure.

11:46.840 --> 11:49.409
Bet you can't eat just 50.

11:53.313 --> 11:55.815
So, how's your ice cream?

11:55.849 --> 11:57.984
Just what I needed
after your burger.

11:58.018 --> 11:59.953
I guess I was hungrier
than I thought.

12:00.053 --> 12:02.422
Have you told Santa
what you want for Christmas?

12:02.455 --> 12:04.457
- Not yet.
- Then let's go do it!

12:04.491 --> 12:06.826
- You're crazy!
- Come on!

12:06.860 --> 12:09.396
Okay, who's next
for a picture with Santa?

12:09.429 --> 12:12.065
Tommy, you're back!
Why?

12:12.098 --> 12:14.968
My mom told me
to apologize to you.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.836
Tommy, that's nice.

12:16.870 --> 12:19.406
I'm sorry...
you ugly old bag!

12:21.508 --> 12:23.276
You little brat!

12:23.309 --> 12:25.879
And a Merry Christmas
to you, Jessie.

12:25.912 --> 12:28.848
- Jessie, this is Laura.
- Both: Hi.

12:28.882 --> 12:31.818
She has to be back at work,
so can we cut in?

12:31.851 --> 12:34.087
- I'm sorry, this is his idea.
- No, it's okay.

12:34.120 --> 12:36.356
As long as you don't
kick me or bite me.

12:36.389 --> 12:38.091
Come on!

12:42.896 --> 12:46.299
Santa, meet Laura. She's 17
and has been
a good girl all year.

12:46.332 --> 12:48.368
That's good, Laura.

12:48.401 --> 12:51.471
- And have you
been a good boy?
- ( scoffs ) Get real!

12:53.940 --> 12:57.110
Tell me, Laura,
what do you
want for Christmas?

13:00.613 --> 13:02.949
I don't know.

13:03.049 --> 13:06.052
Nobody's ever
asked me that before.

13:06.052 --> 13:08.088
But I'll try.

13:09.189 --> 13:11.057
Zack:
Thanks, Santa.

13:11.057 --> 13:13.526
- Thanks for squeezing us in.
- Here's your picture.

13:13.560 --> 13:16.529
- Jessie,
how much do we owe you?
- Uh...

13:18.298 --> 13:21.434
No charge.
Santa says it's on him.

13:23.837 --> 13:25.872
Hey, what did you say to him?

13:25.905 --> 13:28.375
- I can't tell you, Zack.
It's personal.
- What's important is

13:28.408 --> 13:32.078
that you have been
a good girl all year.
So this is for you.

13:32.112 --> 13:34.247
Luring girls with candy again?

13:34.280 --> 13:36.116
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, honey.

13:36.149 --> 13:39.085
- Mom, meet Laura.
- Watch out for my son.

13:39.085 --> 13:42.355
He starts with hard candy
then works up to
chocolate kisses.

13:42.389 --> 13:45.458
- That's how his dad got me.
- I'll be careful.

13:45.492 --> 13:47.527
Mom, Mom.

13:47.560 --> 13:50.096
- Is the play
set for Saturday?
- What play?

13:50.130 --> 13:52.399
"A Christmas Carol."
We'll do it right
here in the mall.

13:52.432 --> 13:55.268
I was just making
some last-minute arrangements.

13:55.301 --> 13:58.438
"A Christmas Carol"?
I've always loved that story.

13:58.471 --> 14:00.607
Would you like to be
in it with us?

14:00.640 --> 14:02.809
That'd be fun.
The whole gang's in it.

14:02.842 --> 14:05.045
I would love to...

14:05.045 --> 14:07.147
but it's my
first day on the job.

14:07.180 --> 14:09.916
Don't you think it's early
to ask for some time off?

14:09.949 --> 14:12.585
Not if you've worked
the whole morning.

14:12.619 --> 14:16.189
I'm sure most store owners
would love to have their
employees in the play.

14:16.222 --> 14:18.525
- It's good for business.
- You really
think it's all right?

14:18.558 --> 14:22.195
Yeah. Your boss is
letting Kelly off.
Why not you?

14:22.228 --> 14:25.265
All right, I'll ask.
It was nice to meet you, Mrs.
Morris.

14:25.298 --> 14:27.634
- You too.
- Bye, Zack.

14:29.269 --> 14:31.971
So do you know what you
want for Christmas yet?

14:32.072 --> 14:34.174
Oh yeah.

14:34.207 --> 14:37.410
I don't think I can find a box
big enough for her.

14:44.451 --> 14:46.519
Slater, will you hurry up?

14:46.553 --> 14:50.090
If you take any longer,
that blouse will
be out of style!

14:50.090 --> 14:52.659
I'm doing the best I can.

14:52.692 --> 14:55.528
Now, where did I put
that piece of tape?

14:55.562 --> 14:57.931
- It's on your nose.
- Huh?

14:57.964 --> 15:00.367
Ow!

15:00.400 --> 15:05.038
I hope Dancer and Prancer
drop a surprise on your car.

15:05.038 --> 15:07.073
- There, all done.
- Thank you.

15:07.107 --> 15:08.842
Wait, Lisa.

15:10.076 --> 15:11.945
Mind if I try?

15:12.045 --> 15:14.447
Don't worry, I wrap
a lot neater than I look.

15:14.481 --> 15:17.050
Is that okay with you, thumbs?

15:17.083 --> 15:19.352
Fine.

15:19.386 --> 15:22.222
I always did enjoy wrapping
Christmas presents.

15:22.255 --> 15:25.191
- I always enjoy getting them.
- Do you like giving too?

15:25.225 --> 15:28.194
Oh yeah.
She just gave me a headache.

15:29.329 --> 15:31.097
There you go.

15:31.131 --> 15:33.500
One Christmas bow
coming right up!

15:35.068 --> 15:37.504
It's beautiful!
Thank you, mister.

15:37.537 --> 15:41.274
- You're welcome.
- I'll see you at
the hospital at 6:00.

15:42.475 --> 15:45.512
Gift Wrap is not for me.
Thanks for helping.

15:45.545 --> 15:47.080
Now,
what can I do for you, sir?

15:47.080 --> 15:50.684
I was wondering if you'd give
me some of those scraps
you're throwing away.

15:50.717 --> 15:54.387
Tell you what,
I'll do better than that.

15:54.421 --> 15:57.691
- Here you go.
- Thanks,
but won't you get in trouble?

15:57.724 --> 16:01.895
Nah. I waste more than that
wrapping a ring!

16:01.928 --> 16:04.064
When you buy your gift,
I'll wrap it for you.

16:04.097 --> 16:06.566
Thanks, but I've
seen you in action.

16:11.438 --> 16:13.440
Hey,
come on, Slater, let's go.

16:13.473 --> 16:16.176
We have to pick up the girls
and meet Lisa at the hospital.

16:16.209 --> 16:18.044
I'll be on my five.

16:19.279 --> 16:21.147
- What's up, buddy?
- What's up?

16:21.181 --> 16:25.919
- Hey, guys, what's going on?
- I'm not sure.

16:25.952 --> 16:28.955
Wait. I think someone's
lying on the ground.

16:30.490 --> 16:32.258
- Guys, look who it is!
- Oh no!

16:32.292 --> 16:34.494
Come on, let's help him!
Excuse me. Back up.

16:34.527 --> 16:37.397
- Screech: Is he still alive?
- Are you okay?

16:37.430 --> 16:40.066
- Screech, call 911.
- Right. What's the number?

16:40.066 --> 16:42.969
Man! 911 is the number!
Call it quick!

16:43.069 --> 16:44.337
- Open it up.
- Okay.

16:44.371 --> 16:47.107
Put one hand under his neck
and left it gently.

16:47.140 --> 16:49.442
- Got it.
- Put your other
hand on his forehead

16:49.476 --> 16:52.545
- and push back
until his chin tilts up.
- Does this open his airway?

16:52.579 --> 16:54.314
I learned it
in lifeguard training.

16:54.347 --> 16:56.449
- ( wheezing )
- He's having
trouble breathing.

16:56.483 --> 16:59.352
Give me that mouth guard.
Move, I got it.

17:02.455 --> 17:04.656
( blows air )

17:21.040 --> 17:24.077
Well, I'm out of here
in five minutes.

17:28.248 --> 17:30.050
Thinking about Zack again?

17:30.050 --> 17:32.819
I can't believe he took me
to see Santa Claus.

17:32.852 --> 17:35.388
I'm surprised he didn't
make you sit on his knee!

17:35.422 --> 17:38.792
- He's really fun. Look.
- Both: How cute!

17:40.493 --> 17:44.064
Save the chatter
for your next pajama party!

17:44.064 --> 17:47.967
I'm sorry, Mr. Moody.
Laura was showing me
a picture of Santa Claus.

17:48.068 --> 17:50.070
The fat guy in red!

17:50.070 --> 17:52.806
He's got
a cholesterol problem.

17:52.839 --> 17:55.809
Mr. Moody, can l
ask you something?

17:55.842 --> 17:57.777
You just did.
Now get back to work.

17:57.811 --> 17:59.779
Please?

17:59.813 --> 18:04.184
I know I just started, but...
can l be in
the Christmas play too?

18:04.217 --> 18:08.021
No! You'll be working!

18:08.054 --> 18:12.826
Everyone wants
me to be generous
just because it's Christmas!

18:12.859 --> 18:14.427
Who needs to see
"A Christmas Carol"?

18:14.461 --> 18:17.063
We've got our
own Scrooge here!

18:20.433 --> 18:22.736
Hi, guys.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.371
Is something wrong?

18:24.404 --> 18:28.408
You know the homeless person
I met this morning?

18:28.441 --> 18:30.043
He passed out
in the mall today.

18:30.076 --> 18:31.711
What happened to him?
Is he okay?

18:31.745 --> 18:33.847
I don't know.
They took him to the hospital.

18:33.880 --> 18:35.849
We'd better get
there ourselves.

18:35.882 --> 18:38.685
Lisa's waiting
for us to give out gifts.

18:38.718 --> 18:40.820
- See you, Laura.
- Bye. I'll see you later.

18:40.854 --> 18:42.322
Bye.

19:01.474 --> 19:03.677
Would you like to hang
this star on top of the tree?

19:03.710 --> 19:05.845
I'm too small!

19:05.879 --> 19:08.381
Not anymore.
Hold this.

19:12.018 --> 19:15.021
Place it right on top.
There you go!

19:15.021 --> 19:17.157
I told you you could do it.

19:20.460 --> 19:23.029
You know something?
You're cute.

19:23.029 --> 19:25.465
So are you... for a girl.

19:29.169 --> 19:31.304
When is Santa coming?

19:31.338 --> 19:33.473
( bells ringing )

19:33.506 --> 19:35.909
I think that's him now.

19:35.942 --> 19:38.745
Santa:
Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas!

19:45.118 --> 19:48.254
Hi, Santa.
Is this Mrs. Claus?

19:48.288 --> 19:50.223
Yes, she wouldn't stay
at the North Pole

19:50.256 --> 19:52.192
when I told her I was
coming to California.

19:52.225 --> 19:56.429
As soon as this party's over,
I'm taking
the sleigh to the beach!

19:56.463 --> 19:58.298
- Hey, Rudolph.
- Hey, Lisa.

19:58.331 --> 20:00.867
Want to play
any reindeer games?

20:00.900 --> 20:04.270
What the heck?
It's Christmas.

20:04.304 --> 20:08.341
She kissed me!
Santa finally gave
me what I asked for!

20:08.375 --> 20:10.343
Thanks!

20:10.377 --> 20:14.114
- Merry Christmas!
- All: Merry Christmas!

20:15.281 --> 20:17.584
Kelly:
Who wants candy canes?

20:22.188 --> 20:23.990
All right!

20:24.357 --> 20:26.593
Here you go.

20:27.927 --> 20:30.063
Who wrapped this?

20:31.031 --> 20:33.333
Hey, it's what's inside
that counts.

20:33.366 --> 20:35.535
Oh. You wrapped it.

20:37.237 --> 20:39.305
Come here, kid.

20:44.244 --> 20:47.147
Kelly:
Is it a police car?
Vroom, vroom!

20:51.084 --> 20:53.019
Well, Lisa...
( laughs )

20:53.053 --> 20:55.055
your party is a big success.

20:55.088 --> 20:57.223
Our party.

20:57.257 --> 21:02.228
You know, Zack, I can't
remember a Christmas
where I've had more fun

21:02.262 --> 21:03.863
and didn't get a thing.

21:03.897 --> 21:06.199
Santa will fix that!

21:07.334 --> 21:10.870
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
It matches my uniform.

21:12.639 --> 21:14.474
- Hey, guys.
- Zack: Hey, buddy.

21:14.507 --> 21:16.943
- Let's go visit
that homeless guy.
- Yeah, good idea.

21:16.976 --> 21:19.079
- Screech:
We'll take him a present.
- Hey, Lisa,

21:19.079 --> 21:20.613
you know the room
number of the guy?

21:20.647 --> 21:24.250
No,
but Monique over there would.
She's in Admitting.

21:25.485 --> 21:27.854
Hi, Monique,
I'm looking for a man.

21:27.887 --> 21:31.091
So am l, but here
they're either
married or sick!

21:31.091 --> 21:33.326
I mean a homeless
guy who collapsed
in the Bayside mall today.

21:33.360 --> 21:36.396
Oh, him.
Nice, but too old for me.

21:36.429 --> 21:38.998
He's in the East wing,
room 306.

21:39.099 --> 21:42.635
- Thanks, Monique.
- Thank you.

21:42.669 --> 21:46.906
Well, kids,
Santa and his little helpers
have to be going now.

21:46.940 --> 21:49.009
There's a big
snowstorm coming.

21:49.109 --> 21:51.578
It never snows in Los Angeles!

21:52.245 --> 21:54.214
Says who?

21:56.583 --> 21:58.418
<i>* Dashing through the snow</i>

21:58.451 --> 22:00.954
<i>* In a one-horse open sleigh</i>

22:01.054 --> 22:03.056
<i>* Over the field we go</i>

22:03.089 --> 22:05.325
<i>* Laughing all the way...</i>
<i>ha ha ha!</i>

22:05.358 --> 22:07.594
<i>* Bells on bobtails ring</i>

22:07.627 --> 22:09.329
<i>* Making spirits bright</i>

22:09.362 --> 22:13.900
<i>* What fun it is</i>
<i>to ride and sing</i>
<i>a sleighing song tonight</i>

22:13.933 --> 22:16.603
<i>* Oh!</i>
<i>Jingle bells, jingle bells</i>

22:16.636 --> 22:19.072
<i>* Jingle all the way!</i>

22:19.072 --> 22:22.609
<i>* Oh what fun it is to ride</i>
<i>in a one-horse open sleigh</i>

22:22.642 --> 22:25.645
<i>* Hey!</i>
<i>Jingle bells, jingle bells</i>

22:25.679 --> 22:28.248
<i>* Jingle all the way... *</i>

22:33.153 --> 22:36.389
- I hope he's feeling better.
- Monique said he
was just run down.

22:36.423 --> 22:39.292
She's wrong.
There were no cars near him.

22:44.464 --> 22:47.300
Laura?
What are you doing here?

22:47.334 --> 22:49.636
Visiting.
He's my father.

22:59.346 --> 23:01.548
( instrumental music plays )
