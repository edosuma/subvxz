WEBVTT

00:01.919 --> 00:03.128
[Dwyer] Big game tonight, Jerry.

00:03.128 --> 00:04.296
New York's gonna show Boston
how it's really done.

00:04.296 --> 00:06.674
-Celtics are going to kill them.
-Want to make it interesting?

00:06.674 --> 00:08.133
All right, a hundred bucks?

00:08.133 --> 00:09.426
Nah, let's do an old school bet?

00:09.426 --> 00:10.886
The loser
is the winner's servant

00:10.886 --> 00:11.887
for a whole week.

00:11.887 --> 00:13.263
So you get my coffee,

00:13.263 --> 00:16.224
pick up my dry cleaning,
anything goes.

00:16.224 --> 00:17.810
All right, deal.

00:17.810 --> 00:19.603
Don't think I'm going to take
it easy on you when I win.

00:19.603 --> 00:21.814
-Haha.
-I'm going to own you.

00:21.814 --> 00:25.192
-[Dwyer] Okay, Gerry.
-That's Master Gerry to you.

00:25.192 --> 00:26.902
Knick's fans.

00:26.902 --> 00:28.988
When will you people learn?

00:31.740 --> 00:33.784
Well, that's coming along great.

00:33.784 --> 00:35.661
Nice work guys.

00:39.581 --> 00:42.125
Celtics are on the road.

00:42.125 --> 00:43.752
You idiot.

00:43.752 --> 00:44.419
Nooo.

00:45.796 --> 00:47.214

00:58.976 --> 01:01.144
Hey, sorry
for interrupting everyone.

01:01.144 --> 01:03.898
Gerry, do you have
my calculator?

01:03.898 --> 01:05.858
Nice try, I gave it
to you last week.

01:05.858 --> 01:07.943
[Simon] That calculator
was my graduation present.

01:07.943 --> 01:09.277
I want that back now.

01:12.865 --> 01:14.491
Look at that.

01:14.491 --> 01:15.743
Ah, you owe me money
'cause I had to put

01:15.743 --> 01:17.202
a new battery in it, sooo...

01:17.202 --> 01:19.038
What, no! I'm not paying you
for a new battery.

01:19.038 --> 01:21.164
-What are you talking about?
-I'm taking the battery out.

01:21.164 --> 01:22.332
No you're not, give me that.

01:22.332 --> 01:23.417
Give me that.

01:23.417 --> 01:24.752
Get your hands off of Janine.

01:24.752 --> 01:26.503
I should never have
let you borrow her.

01:26.503 --> 01:28.463
[Simon sighs]

01:28.463 --> 01:31.299
You're amazing.

01:31.299 --> 01:32.300
Bye, Mr. Hunt.

01:32.300 --> 01:34.053
[Girls giggle]

01:43.771 --> 01:44.855
What was, ah...

01:44.855 --> 01:45.856
what was going on there?

01:45.856 --> 01:46.774
Nothing.

01:46.774 --> 01:47.900
She has a crush on Mr. Hunt.

01:47.900 --> 01:49.359
So do you.

01:49.359 --> 01:50.819
[Gerry] What?

01:50.819 --> 01:53.280
Really? Mr. Hunt?

01:53.280 --> 01:54.907
All right, I was
in high school once too,

01:54.907 --> 01:57.743
so I get when you have
crushes on teachers.

01:57.743 --> 01:59.119
Not... ha...

01:59.119 --> 02:00.996
what I would have expected.

02:00.996 --> 02:03.164
But, everybody has
a different crush.

02:03.164 --> 02:05.208
A little inappropriate.

02:05.208 --> 02:07.252
When a teacher walks in
to do all that...

02:07.252 --> 02:08.629
hehehe.

02:08.629 --> 02:10.464
'Cause other's may have
crushes too, who cares?

02:10.464 --> 02:12.132
Some of you may
have a crush on...

02:12.132 --> 02:14.134
Mr. Chang.

02:14.134 --> 02:15.469
Mr. Chang?

02:15.469 --> 02:17.054
Birds of a feather, right?

02:17.054 --> 02:18.138
That's...

02:18.138 --> 02:21.266
-Mr. Dwyer.
-Mr. ah, hmmm.

02:22.851 --> 02:24.019
[Gerry sighs]

02:24.019 --> 02:25.062
Jane.

02:25.062 --> 02:26.521
Your parents have already

02:26.521 --> 02:28.649
chosen a husband for you.

02:28.649 --> 02:29.858
You have no say.

02:29.858 --> 02:31.276
So you having a crush

02:31.276 --> 02:33.904
on another man is inappropriate.

02:33.904 --> 02:35.447
Your husband has been chosen,

02:35.447 --> 02:36.490
he is out there.

02:36.490 --> 02:37.491
You have not met him,

02:37.491 --> 02:38.617
he may be gorgeous,

02:38.617 --> 02:39.952
he may be sinfully ugly.

02:39.952 --> 02:41.161
But when you meet him,

02:41.161 --> 02:43.288
you will love him.

02:46.125 --> 02:48.209
A lot of girls think
Mr. Fellows is cute.

02:48.209 --> 02:50.587
Mr. Fellows with the...

02:50.587 --> 02:51.964
with the... cleft?

02:51.964 --> 02:53.799
I hear people talking
about Mr. Bondi a lot.

02:53.799 --> 02:56.259
What?! Mist, mist,

02:56.259 --> 02:58.428
Mr. Bondi?

02:58.428 --> 02:59.638
You...

03:00.806 --> 03:03.058
all right, who else?

03:03.058 --> 03:05.978
Go ahead, give it.

03:05.978 --> 03:08.730
I know what's
coming here, girls.

03:08.730 --> 03:10.024
I get it.

03:10.024 --> 03:13.777
Last call
for crushes on teachers.

03:13.777 --> 03:17.447
Whether they are
in the room or not.

03:17.447 --> 03:19.282
All right...

03:19.282 --> 03:20.367
back to work.

03:20.367 --> 03:22.077
-Ms. Galka's pretty.
-Who?

03:22.077 --> 03:23.286
Ms. Galka.

03:25.080 --> 03:26.289
Is... what?

03:26.289 --> 03:28.249
Pretty pretty.

03:29.208 --> 03:30.752
Pretty pretty?

03:32.211 --> 03:33.588
Okay.

03:33.588 --> 03:34.923
[Cheeley]
I just don't understand

03:34.923 --> 03:36.008
why this can't wait.

03:36.008 --> 03:37.300
There's been a kidnapping.

03:37.300 --> 03:38.510
What?

03:39.553 --> 03:40.804
[Cheeley] Oh.

03:40.804 --> 03:42.556
The happy-go-lucky Wayne Leung

03:42.556 --> 03:44.432
that existed before
this was defaced

03:44.432 --> 03:45.976
has been taken.

03:45.976 --> 03:47.644
And I suggest expulsion.

03:47.644 --> 03:49.104
Oh, really? Of whom?

03:49.104 --> 03:51.398
-All of them.
-Wayne, come on.

03:51.398 --> 03:52.733
It's a joke.

03:52.733 --> 03:54.151
I think you're taking
the whole thing

03:54.151 --> 03:55.903
just a little bit too hard.

03:55.903 --> 03:59.156
I think you'll change your mind
when you see your picture.

04:01.449 --> 04:03.035
[Cheeley gasps]

04:03.035 --> 04:04.161
Why am I a rabbit?

04:04.161 --> 04:07.664
Because you're soft.

04:07.664 --> 04:10.792
I think I know exactly
who's responsible for this.

04:10.792 --> 04:12.460
That's more like it.

04:16.590 --> 04:19.134
Okay, and the centerpiece

04:19.134 --> 04:22.221
for Xavier's exciting
new recycling program

04:22.221 --> 04:24.973
is this six-bin system.

04:24.973 --> 04:26.016
So...

04:26.016 --> 04:27.434
thanks, Malik, thank you.

04:27.434 --> 04:30.187
Ah... let's save the planet,
right, guys?

04:30.187 --> 04:31.605
Thanks, Malik.

04:31.605 --> 04:32.981
When did we start doing this?

04:32.981 --> 04:34.775
It's the new recycling
program, Gerry.

04:34.775 --> 04:35.943
Where does this go?

04:35.943 --> 04:37.152
Okay, great. This is a great

04:37.152 --> 04:38.319
teaching opportunity.

04:38.319 --> 04:39.863
So, this gets separated.

04:39.863 --> 04:41.156
The lid goes into plastic...

04:41.156 --> 04:42.950
the sleeve and cup
goes into paper

04:42.950 --> 04:44.868
and then the teabag
goes into compost.

04:44.868 --> 04:47.162
-Easy.
-Oh, okay. That's, ah...

04:47.162 --> 04:48.455
you are crazy if you think

04:48.455 --> 04:49.497
I'm doing that every time

04:49.497 --> 04:50.457
I have garbage.

04:50.457 --> 04:51.708
Okay, it is not a lot to ask

04:51.708 --> 04:53.252
so that my kids can inherit

04:53.252 --> 04:54.377
a healthy planet, okay?

04:54.377 --> 04:55.462
-[Gerry] Your kids?
-Mmmhmm.

04:55.462 --> 04:56.463
Oh, you must have got

04:56.463 --> 04:57.881
artificially inseminated,

04:57.881 --> 04:59.382
'cause you don't have
a boyfriend anymore.

04:59.382 --> 05:00.425
Craig's gone.

05:00.425 --> 05:01.509
Shut it.

05:01.509 --> 05:03.178
So stop putting the cart

05:03.178 --> 05:05.180
before the hor...se.

05:05.180 --> 05:07.224
-Ge...! I...
-Put that away.

05:07.224 --> 05:08.308
Oh, my God.

05:08.308 --> 05:10.060
[Gerry] Hey, Simon?

05:10.060 --> 05:11.728
-Hey.
-I don't know if you know this,

05:11.728 --> 05:14.522
a couple girls in my class
have a little crush on you.

05:14.522 --> 05:16.984
Ahh, cheese whiz. Okay.

05:16.984 --> 05:19.278
I remember the first time that
happened to me. It's just...

05:19.278 --> 05:20.737
I wish this was the first time.

05:20.737 --> 05:22.823
It's getting really
out of hand, Gerry.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.407
Really out of hand.

05:24.407 --> 05:26.409
Oh, you know, just the notes,

05:26.409 --> 05:28.369
the compliments...

05:28.369 --> 05:30.831
little screams when
I'm walking down the hallway.

05:30.831 --> 05:33.208
Little yelps and screams.

05:33.208 --> 05:34.918
Had to pull a girl outside
the other day...

05:34.918 --> 05:36.503
had to sit her down
and tell her, you know

05:36.503 --> 05:39.380
your crush,
while understandable,

05:39.380 --> 05:40.257
not acceptable.

05:40.257 --> 05:41.675
-No. No.
-Not acceptable!

05:41.675 --> 05:43.135
I mean, what do these
girls think? You know?

05:43.135 --> 05:45.012
Do they think
they're ever going to date me?

05:45.012 --> 05:47.514
Not one of them
reminds me of my mother.

05:47.514 --> 05:48.765
You know what I mean?

05:48.765 --> 05:50.851
Yeah. Yes... I'm...

05:50.851 --> 05:52.853
probably going to... yeah.

05:52.853 --> 05:55.981
Hey, Simon. You're still doing
the teacher fashion show right?

05:55.981 --> 05:59.318
-Yeah, girl! Wouldn't miss that.
-Great.

05:59.318 --> 06:00.861
Gerry, do you want
to strut your stuff

06:00.861 --> 06:02.529
in the fashion show or what?

06:02.529 --> 06:03.947
Ahh, let me think.

06:03.947 --> 06:05.199
No. That may be

06:05.199 --> 06:06.950
the lamest thing
I've ever heard, so...

06:06.950 --> 06:08.702
-Right.
-I'm not desperate

06:08.702 --> 06:10.287
for attention like others.

06:10.287 --> 06:12.455
-No offense.
-Oh, lots taken.

06:12.455 --> 06:13.999
Thanks, Gerry.

06:13.999 --> 06:15.583
[bell rings]

06:16.710 --> 06:18.753
David Alexander.
Check his hands.

06:18.753 --> 06:20.797
What's goin' on, sir?

06:20.797 --> 06:22.757
-[Cheeley] How are they?
-Silky smooth.

06:22.757 --> 06:23.800
That's not what I was after.

06:23.800 --> 06:24.885
Is there any marker on them?

06:24.885 --> 06:26.178
No, they're clean.

06:26.178 --> 06:27.721
Okay, you know what?
It doesn't matter.

06:27.721 --> 06:29.890
We know you did this.

06:29.890 --> 06:31.266
So why don't you make
this easy on us

06:31.266 --> 06:34.102
and just come clean?

06:34.102 --> 06:35.478
I didn't do this, sir.

06:35.478 --> 06:37.272
[Leung] Damnit!

06:37.272 --> 06:38.732
Easy.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.067
Cartoons?

06:40.067 --> 06:42.069
Give me some credit,
that's baby stuff.

06:42.069 --> 06:44.071
Is it? Do you happen
to know the baby

06:44.071 --> 06:45.572
that did this then
if it wasn't you?

06:45.572 --> 06:46.573
Maybe,

06:46.573 --> 06:47.657
but I would never rat out

06:47.657 --> 06:48.742
my fellow student.

06:48.742 --> 06:51.286
Oh, you wouldn't?

06:51.286 --> 06:54.206
Not even for one
get-out-of-detention free card?

06:54.206 --> 06:56.208
[Leung quietly] Yeah.

06:56.208 --> 06:59.961
And I have nothing
of value to give you.

07:01.838 --> 07:04.216
All right, you got a deal.

07:04.216 --> 07:05.675
-[Lori] Hey, sir.
-Hey.

07:05.675 --> 07:07.219
I like your shirt.

07:08.511 --> 07:10.305
What was that?

07:10.305 --> 07:12.182
I like your shirt,
it looks nice on you.

07:12.182 --> 07:13.975
Okay, can I speak to you
for a second please?

07:13.975 --> 07:15.936
Yup.

07:15.936 --> 07:17.187
What's up, sir?

07:17.187 --> 07:19.940
Okay, what you said
back there...

07:19.940 --> 07:20.941
first of all...

07:20.941 --> 07:23.610
understand, I am not angry,

07:23.610 --> 07:25.237
but there are boundaries.

07:25.237 --> 07:26.529
Not angry about what?

07:26.529 --> 07:28.823
Okay... you want me
to spell this out.

07:29.950 --> 07:32.327
I've had crushes
on teachers before.

07:32.327 --> 07:33.703
I get it.

07:33.703 --> 07:35.122
I don't have a crush on you.

07:35.122 --> 07:36.331
Okay...

07:36.331 --> 07:39.126
you stick to that
and we're fine.

07:39.126 --> 07:41.795
Is this because I said
I liked your shirt?

07:41.795 --> 07:43.338
You kind of implied

07:43.338 --> 07:46.716
that you liked
what was in the shirt.

07:46.716 --> 07:47.968
Why would I have
a crush on you?

07:47.968 --> 07:49.970
Okay, no need to lash out

07:49.970 --> 07:51.138
and get angry here.

07:51.138 --> 07:52.347
I'm sorry sir, but I don't

07:52.347 --> 07:53.348
have a crush on you.

07:53.348 --> 07:54.724
You're not that cool,

07:54.724 --> 07:55.809
and you're not that young.

07:55.809 --> 07:58.270
Right, like Mr. Hunt?

07:58.270 --> 07:59.313
Like Mr. Dwyer.

07:59.313 --> 08:01.148
Ah, sorry, we are the same age.

08:01.148 --> 08:03.024
Okay, just cool then.
You're just not cool.

08:03.024 --> 08:04.276
[quietly] Just not cool.

08:04.276 --> 08:06.194
I mean, I'm sure
you used to be cool.

08:06.194 --> 08:07.321
When you were younger, I guess.

08:07.321 --> 08:09.072
Yeah, yes. Oh, thank you, Lori.

08:09.072 --> 08:10.573
-Can I go back?
-Yeah, you can go.

08:10.573 --> 08:12.159
-Go, go, go.
-Thanks.

08:12.159 --> 08:14.244
Why don't you
get to class, girls?

08:14.244 --> 08:16.579
Instead of hanging
out in the halls...

08:16.579 --> 08:18.415
hitting on teachers.

08:18.415 --> 08:19.624
Disgusting.

08:21.293 --> 08:23.753
So students don't have crushes
on you, what's the big deal?

08:23.753 --> 08:25.339
I didn't say it was a big deal,

08:25.339 --> 08:26.381
but it's a little bit flattering

08:26.381 --> 08:27.548
when you hear they do.

08:27.548 --> 08:28.967
And it's a sign of respect

08:28.967 --> 08:30.510
and that they look at you
like a role model.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.012
-That's all.
-Well, I don't know,

08:32.012 --> 08:33.305
I had a crush on Ms. Gleeson

08:33.305 --> 08:34.764
and it wasn't
for any of those reasons.

08:34.764 --> 08:36.183
Maybe you're just not as,

08:36.183 --> 08:37.684
you know, cool and young
as you think you are.

08:37.684 --> 08:39.478
No, that is not it, Bill.

08:39.478 --> 08:42.439
I think I'm actually
too hard on them.

08:42.439 --> 08:43.523
And they look at me...

08:43.523 --> 08:45.108
Yeah, that's probably it,

08:45.108 --> 08:46.276
-Amanda? Come here for a sec.
-What are you doing?

08:46.276 --> 08:47.735
-No, no don't...
-Amanda,

08:47.735 --> 08:48.987
this is my buddy, Gerry,
he's a teacher

08:48.987 --> 08:50.405
and Amanda
just finished high school.

08:50.405 --> 08:52.199
So, let me ask you,

08:52.199 --> 08:53.700
do you think you would
have had a crush on him?

08:53.700 --> 08:55.535
-[Gerry quietly] Yes.
-No.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.037
Right.

08:57.037 --> 08:58.705
But I've got an Aunt
who'd probably like you.

08:58.705 --> 09:00.874
Oh, yeah. Well,
I have an ugly friend

09:00.874 --> 09:02.792
that might like you, so...

09:02.792 --> 09:04.294
[Amanda] Why do you want
students to have

09:04.294 --> 09:05.628
-crushes on you anyway?
-[Gerry] Ugh.

09:05.628 --> 09:07.588
-That's pretty creepy.
-You're creepy.

09:07.588 --> 09:10.217
Okay, first of all,
she's the same age as us.

09:10.217 --> 09:12.844
So, you don't have crushes
on people at our age.

09:12.844 --> 09:15.638
-We are not the same age.
-Oh, give me a break.

09:15.638 --> 09:17.598
Bill, can I see you
later tonight?

09:17.598 --> 09:19.267
-All right.
-[Amanda] Cool.

09:20.894 --> 09:23.480
-See? That's a crush.
-Yeah, if ya like cougars.

09:27.608 --> 09:29.903
Look, I know it might take
a little bit more effort but...

09:29.903 --> 09:32.447
Little bit?
This is a bigger waste of time

09:32.447 --> 09:34.241
than most of my relationships.

09:34.241 --> 09:36.201
What happens if we put
something in the wrong bin?

09:36.201 --> 09:39.246
-I think we all die.
-Oh, come on, guys.

09:39.246 --> 09:41.289
God forbid
you should put a milk carton

09:41.289 --> 09:43.208
in the plastics bin.

09:44.251 --> 09:45.585
That is enough.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.879
Boobie do good things
and you cry.

09:47.879 --> 09:51.591
[Malik pretends to cry]

09:51.591 --> 09:53.009
Poor Trududy,

09:53.009 --> 09:54.428
Boobie make her save the planet.

09:54.428 --> 09:56.513
While Malik home country
fight hurricane

09:56.513 --> 09:58.056
and animals flying.

10:03.478 --> 10:07.607
Didn't realize he was such
a little firecracker.

10:07.607 --> 10:09.234
Wouldn't mind
having a little slice

10:09.234 --> 10:11.278
of that Life of Pi.

10:11.278 --> 10:13.447
No cool. Not cool Trudy.

10:13.447 --> 10:16.491
[music]

10:16.491 --> 10:18.743
This kid is a monster, okay?

10:18.743 --> 10:20.161
One tough nut to crack.

10:20.161 --> 10:21.538
So here's the strategy.

10:21.538 --> 10:22.789
I'll be the good cop and you...

10:22.789 --> 10:24.583
I'll be the cop
that's an alcoholic,

10:24.583 --> 10:25.959
his wife just left him.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.377
He's two days away
from retirement

10:27.377 --> 10:28.795
and he doesn't have
time for this.

10:28.795 --> 10:30.088
He lives on the beach

10:30.088 --> 10:31.881
in a trailer with his dog Rusty.

10:31.881 --> 10:33.300
That's good.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.051
Makes my guy seem
so boring all of a sudden.

10:35.051 --> 10:36.511
I'm sorry. You chose good cop.

10:36.511 --> 10:37.887
I know, but just
because he's the good cop

10:37.887 --> 10:39.139
doesn't mean... maybe he's not

10:39.139 --> 10:40.223
going through
a bad time or something.

10:40.223 --> 10:41.224
What do you want?

10:41.224 --> 10:43.059
-Prone to outbursts?
-Fine.

10:43.059 --> 10:45.770
-Unorthodox methods?
-No! No.

10:45.770 --> 10:47.606
Do you think a cop
that lives down by the beach

10:47.606 --> 10:49.608
with his dog is going
to play by the rules?

10:49.608 --> 10:52.902
He's tough.
This is not going to be easy.

10:52.902 --> 10:54.737
Nothing worth having ever is.

10:54.737 --> 10:55.780
Okay.

10:55.780 --> 10:57.115
Cagney.

10:57.115 --> 10:58.241
Tubs.

11:07.083 --> 11:09.210
So, Alex, before we begin

11:09.210 --> 11:10.337
anything you'd like to confess?

11:10.337 --> 11:11.546
Maybe something you did wrong?

11:11.546 --> 11:12.922
I didn't do anything wrong.

11:12.922 --> 11:14.633
[Leung] Hey, we'll be
the judge of that.

11:14.633 --> 11:16.343
-You're scaring me.
-Good,

11:16.343 --> 11:18.928
because day's about
to turn into night,

11:18.928 --> 11:21.014
young friend.

11:21.014 --> 11:24.476
-Mr. Leung, that's a bit much.
-[Leung quietly] What?

11:24.476 --> 11:26.436
Alex, we'd just like
to ask you a couple questions

11:26.436 --> 11:28.146
about a couple
of staff pictures.

11:28.146 --> 11:31.774
-Why? What happened to them?
-Oh, come on, Alex!

11:33.776 --> 11:36.488
Just fess up, bud.
We know you did it.

11:36.488 --> 11:38.490
Be honest,
it's the right thing to do.

11:38.490 --> 11:40.575
I haven't even seen
the pictures.

11:40.575 --> 11:42.285
Hey! You kiss your mother

11:42.285 --> 11:44.454
with that filthy lying mouth?

11:44.454 --> 11:46.581
[Alex starts to cry a bit]

11:46.581 --> 11:48.625
I swear, I didn't do anything.

11:48.625 --> 11:49.959
[Alex starts to cry a lot]

11:49.959 --> 11:50.877
Oh, dear.

11:50.877 --> 11:54.297
Please, let me go.

11:54.297 --> 11:57.467
-It's not your fault.
-Breathe, breathe.

11:57.467 --> 11:59.386
-[Cheeley] Calm down.
-[Leung] Calm, relax.

11:59.386 --> 12:00.719
-[Cheeley] Take a breath.
-Breathe.

12:00.719 --> 12:02.930
-[Cheeley] Yeah, sunshine.
-In, out.

12:04.432 --> 12:06.184
What the hell is going on here?

12:06.184 --> 12:08.395
Huh?

12:08.395 --> 12:09.604
[Alex continues to cry]

12:09.604 --> 12:11.022
[Callaghan] Alex?

12:11.022 --> 12:14.150
[Alex cries]

12:14.150 --> 12:15.694
What are you doing to this boy?

12:17.445 --> 12:18.613
Slow down, please.

12:21.115 --> 12:22.617
What's up, boss?

12:22.617 --> 12:23.618
Hey, Gerry. What's up?

12:23.618 --> 12:25.245
Not much, chillin'.

12:26.829 --> 12:28.498
Nice and slow. Thanks.

12:28.498 --> 12:29.999
-Hey, Mr. Hunt.
-Hey, Mr. Hunt.

12:29.999 --> 12:32.085
Hi, girls.

12:32.085 --> 12:34.629
What's so funny?
That wasn't funny.

12:34.629 --> 12:37.507
What are you doing
this weekend, Mr. Hunt?

12:37.507 --> 12:39.342
Ah, girls, I'm sorry,
it's not appropriate for me

12:39.342 --> 12:40.759
to discuss personal life.

12:40.759 --> 12:42.262
Yeah, girls.
That's not appropriate.

12:42.262 --> 12:43.762
There are boundaries.

12:43.762 --> 12:45.348
There are things
you don't ask us.

12:45.348 --> 12:46.641
-[Simon] Exactly.
-It's none of your business

12:46.641 --> 12:48.351
what Mr. Hunt does
on the weekend.

12:48.351 --> 12:49.936
-[Simon] Mmmhmm.
-Okay, if he's going home,

12:49.936 --> 12:52.105
where he lives...
with his mother

12:52.105 --> 12:53.565
to hang out with her,
what are you doing this weekend?

12:53.565 --> 12:55.483
Probably just going
to rent some movies.

12:55.483 --> 12:56.943
[girls] Cute.

12:56.943 --> 12:59.112
Okay, or if I'm going clubbing,
who cares.

12:59.112 --> 13:01.155
That's none of your business.
You can't come.

13:01.155 --> 13:03.032
I'm not telling you
what club I'm going to.

13:03.032 --> 13:04.659
You're not even old enough.

13:04.659 --> 13:06.953
So, enough with the questions
about what we're doing.

13:06.953 --> 13:08.496
-Yeah.
-Ya got it?

13:08.496 --> 13:09.664
Hey, you're in the fashion show

13:09.664 --> 13:10.789
Mr. Hunt, that's pretty cool.

13:10.789 --> 13:13.376
-That's cool?
-Really cool.

13:13.376 --> 13:14.793
-Bye, Mr. Hunt.
-Bye.

13:14.793 --> 13:15.962
Don't be telling everybody

13:15.962 --> 13:18.131
he lives with his mother!

13:18.131 --> 13:19.424
Please!

13:20.759 --> 13:22.302
Thanks for that.
But I think I'm gonna have

13:22.302 --> 13:25.430
to have a discussion
with those girls.

13:25.430 --> 13:26.598
See ya later.

13:27.682 --> 13:29.183
See ya later.

13:30.518 --> 13:32.395
That's all it is.

13:32.395 --> 13:34.063
All right, what's going on?

13:34.063 --> 13:36.065
Well, sir, we are very close

13:36.065 --> 13:37.692
to figuring out who did this.

13:37.692 --> 13:40.528
-Gawee.
-You think it was Gawee?

13:40.528 --> 13:42.697
He's not my biggest fan.
And you should hear

13:42.697 --> 13:44.741
the filthy things
he says about you.

13:44.741 --> 13:47.994
[Cheeley] Wayne, stop it.
It was David, he set us up.

13:47.994 --> 13:52.248
-David! Let's roll.
-Mr. Leung, sit down.

13:52.248 --> 13:55.752
Look, some kid drew
on your pictures, get over it.

13:55.752 --> 13:57.462
Go apologize to Alex

13:57.462 --> 13:58.630
and then drop this whole thing.

13:58.630 --> 13:59.964
Understood?

13:59.964 --> 14:02.091
Yes, but I really think

14:02.091 --> 14:03.510
if I could just
have five minutes

14:03.510 --> 14:06.012
-alone with David I could...
-Understood?

14:06.012 --> 14:08.348
-Yup.
-Understood.

14:10.517 --> 14:12.059
Do you want our badges?

14:13.269 --> 14:15.355
Lisa, can I still be
in the fashion show?

14:15.355 --> 14:16.773
You want to be
in the fashion show now?

14:16.773 --> 14:18.191
Yeah, that's what I just said.

14:18.191 --> 14:19.734
Oh, I thought you weren't lame

14:19.734 --> 14:21.027
and desperate for attention.

14:21.027 --> 14:22.445
Okay, can I be in it or not?

14:22.445 --> 14:24.197
Yes, but only because
somebody dropped out.

14:24.197 --> 14:26.658
Awesome. All right,
I usually wear something sporty.

14:26.658 --> 14:28.034
Or, ah, maybe something...

14:28.034 --> 14:30.036
Your outfit's already
picked out for you.

14:30.036 --> 14:31.871
All right, what is it?

14:31.871 --> 14:33.206
Tweed.

14:34.457 --> 14:35.834
I'm not wearing that.

14:35.834 --> 14:37.126
Why not? It's fine. This is what

14:37.126 --> 14:38.127
Callaghan was supposed to wear

14:38.127 --> 14:39.253
before he dropped out.

14:39.253 --> 14:40.213
I'm replacing Callaghan?

14:40.213 --> 14:42.465
Callaghan's twice my age.

14:42.465 --> 14:44.509
It's perfect
for your age range, Gerry.

14:44.509 --> 14:46.469
No, it's... we're not
in the same age range.

14:46.469 --> 14:50.181
You're on the lower end of it,
but yeah, totally.

14:51.808 --> 14:54.853
[music]

14:57.856 --> 15:00.316
Simon! What does Lisa
have you wearing?

15:00.316 --> 15:02.610
Oh, just some cool jeans
and a tight t-shirt that says...

15:02.610 --> 15:04.654
Switch! Switch with me.
Let me wear that.

15:04.654 --> 15:06.155
What? Why what are you wearing?

15:06.155 --> 15:08.324
What's the difference?
We'll just switch.

15:08.324 --> 15:09.492
You're right,
I can probably pull off

15:09.492 --> 15:10.785
-anything at this point.
-Thanks.

15:10.785 --> 15:13.663
I feel real confident
these days.

15:13.663 --> 15:18.167
Alex, the reason we brought you
in here is because we...

15:18.167 --> 15:19.544
want to apologize.

15:21.254 --> 15:22.797
Why am I here?

15:22.797 --> 15:25.091
Because you're going
to apologize to Alex as well.

15:25.091 --> 15:27.260
-For what?
-For lying to us.

15:27.260 --> 15:28.428
I didn't lie.

15:28.428 --> 15:29.888
Word around
the school was that

15:29.888 --> 15:32.265
Alex was the one who drew
on your pictures.

15:32.265 --> 15:34.100
Really? Because Alex told us

15:34.100 --> 15:36.977
he's never even seen
the pictures.

15:36.977 --> 15:39.689
-I think I'm going to cry again.
-Everything's fine.

15:39.689 --> 15:41.816
We believe you...

15:41.816 --> 15:43.735
and I'm sorry.

15:44.736 --> 15:46.696
Thank you.

15:46.696 --> 15:50.617
And I... was told
to apologize as well.

15:50.617 --> 15:51.743
Thanks.

15:54.579 --> 15:55.830
David?

15:55.830 --> 15:56.956
Uh... but...

15:56.956 --> 15:58.165
David!

15:59.542 --> 16:02.044
-I'm sorry.
-That's okay.

16:02.044 --> 16:03.713
I know you're just
doing your jobs.

16:03.713 --> 16:05.632
And I don't think
you look like a rabbit.

16:05.632 --> 16:07.007
And you're not the devil.

16:07.007 --> 16:09.302
Oh, thank you.

16:09.302 --> 16:10.553
Wait a second.

16:10.553 --> 16:12.931
