00:02.535 --> 00:04.970
Food has, just like,
grasp on me.

00:04.972 --> 00:08.107
<i>I think I lean on food more
than I did substances because</i>

00:08.109 --> 00:10.042
<i>when I eat food, I don't think
about the substances.</i>

00:16.383 --> 00:19.084
<i>[woman] Somewhere in me is
this little glimmer of hope.</i>

00:19.753 --> 00:22.121
<i>I just wanna be a normal person.</i>

00:23.056 --> 00:25.524
[breathing heavily]

00:32.966 --> 00:36.035
<i>[man] You can't do it and
then I just get mad.</i>

00:36.037 --> 00:37.936
<i>[woman 2] If I don't
make a change now,</i>

00:37.938 --> 00:39.471
<i>I'm scared it's
gonna be too late.</i>

00:43.610 --> 00:46.712
[groaning] It hurts.

00:46.714 --> 00:49.148
<i>[woman 3] I refuse
to stop fighting.</i>

00:49.150 --> 00:51.183
<i>I have to do this
for my children.</i>

00:57.891 --> 00:58.957
Can't even get my leg in.

00:58.959 --> 00:59.858
[grunts]

00:59.860 --> 01:01.460
[panting]

01:01.795 --> 01:04.263
[bleep] I hate this car.

01:46.473 --> 01:49.541
<i>[Ryan] The life that I am living
at the size that I am right now, is...</i>

01:49.543 --> 01:53.045
It's something that no one
should ever experience.

01:53.047 --> 01:55.047
It's not really a life.

01:56.816 --> 01:59.485
<i>Because I can't do
anything anymore, really.</i>

02:00.019 --> 02:01.052
<i>I'm too big.</i>

02:02.355 --> 02:05.090
I haven't slept on a bed,
a real bed, in probably,

02:05.125 --> 02:07.025
uh, eight years.

02:07.594 --> 02:09.795
<i>It's just too
hard to get in one.</i>

02:09.797 --> 02:13.532
<i>So I sit in this chair all day
long and try not to get up.</i>

02:13.534 --> 02:16.034
<i>But if I do, all the pain
that's pulling on me</i>

02:16.036 --> 02:17.870
<i>is excruciating.</i>

02:17.872 --> 02:20.072
<i>So I try not to
get up unless I have to.</i>

02:20.074 --> 02:23.208
<i>Usually I only do it
to use the bathroom.</i>

02:27.380 --> 02:29.781
<i>I still have some hardened
lymphedema on my leg</i>

02:29.783 --> 02:31.350
<i>that pulls on me</i>

02:31.352 --> 02:33.051
<i>and swings when I walk.</i>

02:33.053 --> 02:35.521
<i>It makes the
pain ten times worse.</i>

02:35.523 --> 02:37.189
<i>On some days, I can manage.</i>

02:37.191 --> 02:40.392
<i>Other days, it's horrible.
It hurts... significantly.</i>

02:40.793 --> 02:41.793
<i>And, uh,</i>

02:41.795 --> 02:44.062
<i>it's getting harder and harder</i>

02:44.064 --> 02:46.932
<i>to stay mobile and to
get around as I need.</i>

02:47.934 --> 02:50.736
<i>I can't even fit in normal
doorways anymore.</i>

02:50.738 --> 02:53.105
I have to turn sideways to get
through the bathroom door.

02:53.773 --> 02:55.908
<i>Once I make it
to the bathroom, I can't</i>

02:55.910 --> 02:58.110
<i>take too long.
Or I'll get too tired.</i>

02:58.112 --> 03:00.078
<i>And by the time I finish,</i>

03:00.213 --> 03:01.947
<i>I'm so exhausted.</i>

03:02.482 --> 03:04.616
<i>I get winded and out of breath.</i>

03:04.618 --> 03:08.253
<i>I just feel like I'm gasping
and sucking for air constantly.</i>

03:09.822 --> 03:12.524
<i>And I'm gonna have to
take my time getting back.</i>

03:12.526 --> 03:17.062
<i>Because I'm too weak
to walk fast without falling.</i>

03:17.064 --> 03:20.232
<i>So I have to be careful
making it back to my recliner.</i>

03:21.901 --> 03:23.835
<i>But even when I get there,</i>

03:23.837 --> 03:27.706
<i>at my size, it's just not as
simple as sitting back down.</i>

03:27.708 --> 03:30.909
<i>Because my knees can't hold
my weight bending down like that.</i>

03:30.911 --> 03:33.245
<i>So I come down
hard on it each time.</i>

03:33.247 --> 03:36.014
<i>And I know at some point
the recliner has to give.</i>

03:36.082 --> 03:37.716
<i>And if that happens,</i>

03:37.718 --> 03:39.484
<i>I'm scared I'm gonna
get seriously hurt.</i>

03:40.920 --> 03:43.021
<i>But this is the only
way I can manage.</i>

03:43.023 --> 03:44.289
<i>I can't lie down,</i>

03:45.158 --> 03:46.692
<i>or use a normal chair.</i>

03:46.694 --> 03:49.361
<i>So this is where I
stay just about all day.</i>

03:49.363 --> 03:52.197
<i>I even have to
clean myself here.</i>

03:52.199 --> 03:55.067
<i>Because I can't stand long
enough in the bathroom.</i>

03:55.868 --> 03:57.970
<i>Basically, all I can do</i>

03:57.972 --> 04:00.172
<i>is wipe down as best as I can.</i>

04:00.174 --> 04:01.673
<i>And my mom or Leroy,</i>

04:01.675 --> 04:03.809
<i>my mom's boyfriend,</i>

04:03.811 --> 04:05.744
<i>bring me some water
to help me do it.</i>

04:05.746 --> 04:07.412
<i>Most of the time, it's Leroy.</i>

04:09.849 --> 04:12.784
Hey, Leroy, can you please
bring down my towel, please?

04:12.786 --> 04:14.319
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

04:16.689 --> 04:18.290
<i>I let Leroy know that I'm ready</i>

04:18.292 --> 04:20.425
<i>for my bath water,
and he'll bring it down to me.</i>

04:25.265 --> 04:26.632
There you go.

04:26.634 --> 04:28.300
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

04:30.303 --> 04:31.837
<i>Then him and
my mom, if she's home,</i>

04:31.839 --> 04:34.740
<i>will wait upstairs to
give me some privacy.</i>

04:34.742 --> 04:37.009
<i>But I hate the whole
process of cleaning myself.</i>

04:43.883 --> 04:45.684
<i>Bathing myself, um,</i>

04:45.686 --> 04:48.453
it's just difficult because it's
hard to reach all the places.

04:48.455 --> 04:50.789
<i>I just can't reach around
my whole body anymore.</i>

04:50.791 --> 04:54.126
<i>It's not possible, so I'm
limited in what I can do.</i>

04:56.863 --> 04:58.997
Something that should
take three to five minutes,

04:58.999 --> 05:00.899
you know, takes 15 to 20
at times just because

05:00.901 --> 05:02.434
<i>my physical health.</i>

05:09.575 --> 05:11.877
<i>And, I always have
to stop before I finish.</i>

05:11.879 --> 05:13.945
<i>So I know that I could be
a lot cleaner than I am.</i>

05:13.947 --> 05:16.715
<i>But I just do the best
I can for as long as I can.</i>

05:16.717 --> 05:20.052
<i>Then I have to be done no
matter if I'm fully clean or not.</i>

05:23.189 --> 05:25.791
<i>Then after my bath, it's
my favorite part of the day.</i>

05:25.793 --> 05:28.060
<i>Because I get to
start doing what I love best.</i>

05:30.697 --> 05:32.698
<i>So I re-clothe myself and then</i>

05:32.700 --> 05:34.599
<i>I let them know that
it's safe to come down.</i>

05:34.601 --> 05:37.202
<i>And once I get situated
again, it's time to eat.</i>

05:37.204 --> 05:39.938
<i>So my mom will usually
start breakfast for me,</i>

05:39.940 --> 05:41.173
<i>and Leroy will get my drink.</i>

05:41.175 --> 05:44.042
Can you guys... Leroy, can
you come down and help me?

05:44.044 --> 05:45.344
[Leroy] Yeah.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.013
Can you put some
soda in there, please?

05:48.015 --> 05:48.947
Sure.

05:48.949 --> 05:49.948
<i>I don't usually
eat a big breakfast,</i>

05:49.950 --> 05:52.017
<i>so my drink is what
I really want most.</i>

05:52.752 --> 05:54.853
<i>That's one of the most
important things to me</i>

05:54.855 --> 05:56.555
<i>is to have my cup
filled with what I like.</i>

05:56.557 --> 05:58.023
<i>The soda I like.</i>

05:58.025 --> 06:01.226
<i>And I nurse that all day long
even when I'm not eating.</i>

06:01.228 --> 06:03.061
<i>But I can't get all that myself,</i>

06:03.063 --> 06:04.730
<i>so Leroy helps me a lot.</i>

06:04.732 --> 06:06.565
<i>He's almost the same age as me.</i>

06:06.567 --> 06:07.899
<i>He's just a little older.</i>

06:07.901 --> 06:09.668
<i>So I like hanging out
with him when we can.</i>

06:09.670 --> 06:12.137
<i>He and my mom are
basically my whole world now.</i>

06:12.139 --> 06:14.740
<i>Because all I do is sit
here and eat all day.</i>

06:14.742 --> 06:17.275
<i>But as long as I'm eating
and I have my drink, I'm happy.</i>

06:17.877 --> 06:19.778
- How are you?
- Good morning, Mom.

06:19.780 --> 06:22.180
What would you like
for breakfast, darling?

06:22.182 --> 06:24.916
Uh, couple of
breakfast burritos,

06:24.918 --> 06:27.052
some sausage and
bacon and a bagel.

06:27.820 --> 06:29.821
- Sausage and bacon?
- Yeah.

06:29.823 --> 06:31.423
- Bagel with cream cheese?
- Please.

06:32.492 --> 06:34.526
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

06:34.528 --> 06:36.528
Eating my favorite foods
make me feel great.

06:36.530 --> 06:37.729
It makes it to where I don't

06:37.731 --> 06:40.065
think about all the other
things that are going on.

06:44.337 --> 06:45.837
Bub, do you want your
meat in your eggs?

06:45.872 --> 06:47.472
Yes, please.

06:48.975 --> 06:51.877
<i>When I'm eating food, there's a
lot of comfort that I get from eating.</i>

06:51.879 --> 06:55.213
I just... don't think
about anything else

06:55.215 --> 06:58.016
and that's also, like--
So it's mind-numbing.

06:58.018 --> 07:00.552
And that's-- that's what I need.

07:01.854 --> 07:03.522
<i>So when I eat,
I never wanna stop.</i>

07:03.524 --> 07:04.990
<i>And I never feel like I have to.</i>

07:04.992 --> 07:08.794
<i>Because I've never really
felt... like I was full.</i>

07:08.796 --> 07:10.195
<i>That's a feeling I never get.</i>

07:10.197 --> 07:11.930
<i>So I only stop when I run out.</i>

07:11.932 --> 07:14.032
<i>But if I didn't, then...</i>

07:14.034 --> 07:15.467
I could keep eating,
and eating and eating.

07:18.004 --> 07:20.372
<i>By the time I finish
the meal that I'm eating,</i>

07:20.374 --> 07:22.340
<i>I'm already thinking
about the next meal.</i>

07:22.342 --> 07:25.043
<i>Like, when I'm eating breakfast, I ask
my mom what we're having for lunch.</i>

07:25.045 --> 07:27.512
I need to know what's
in line, and what's next.

07:28.815 --> 07:30.482
<i>Because I already
can't wait to eat again,</i>

07:30.484 --> 07:31.983
<i>even though I just did.</i>

07:31.985 --> 07:35.153
<i>So, my whole day basically revolves
around me eating and drinking</i>

07:35.155 --> 07:38.723
<i>and how I'm gonna get more
of it, and that's what drives me.</i>

07:38.725 --> 07:40.525
<i>And that's what
consumes my thoughts</i>

07:40.527 --> 07:43.462
<i>and what I do
all day and everyday.</i>

07:43.830 --> 07:45.864
<i>Eating is basically my life.</i>

07:45.866 --> 07:49.234
<i>And honestly, it's been that
way for me for a long time.</i>

07:53.206 --> 07:55.740
<i>My life has
always been a struggle.</i>

07:55.742 --> 07:57.309
<i>I never met my birth father.</i>

07:59.946 --> 08:01.680
<i>And as far as I'm concerned,</i>

08:01.682 --> 08:03.381
<i>all he was was a sperm donor.</i>

08:05.585 --> 08:08.854
<i>And he just didn't care
to stick around.</i>

08:08.856 --> 08:11.490
<i>But for most of my childhood,
I thought that my stepdad,</i>

08:11.492 --> 08:13.692
<i>Jeff, was my biological father.</i>

08:13.694 --> 08:15.660
<i>And so, I didn't
understand growing up</i>

08:15.662 --> 08:17.095
<i>why he never seemed to like me.</i>

08:17.097 --> 08:19.698
I was always seeking
attention from him.

08:19.700 --> 08:22.701
Trying to get him to
wanna do things with me.

08:22.703 --> 08:25.670
<i>But he never wanted to and
never treated me like he cared.</i>

08:25.672 --> 08:28.073
<i>He only cared about
my sister and my mom.</i>

08:28.075 --> 08:30.642
<i>I knew my sister was
his biological child.</i>

08:30.644 --> 08:32.811
<i>Because she was
born when I was three.</i>

08:32.813 --> 08:36.081
<i>But I didn't know I wasn't
Jeff's real son until later on.</i>

08:36.083 --> 08:37.749
<i>He always made
me feel like I was this</i>

08:37.751 --> 08:40.519
<i>burden or problem
he wanted gone.</i>

08:40.521 --> 08:42.888
<i>And then my choice from
that was to turn to food.</i>

08:42.890 --> 08:45.090
<i>Because it always made
me feel better, you know.</i>

08:45.092 --> 08:46.691
You feel bad you,
you eat a doughnut.

08:46.693 --> 08:48.960
And that's how I coped
with a lot of things.

08:48.962 --> 08:51.663
<i>Turned to food to get the
comfort that I was looking for.</i>

08:51.665 --> 08:55.066
<i>And it filled that void, so
food became my best friend.</i>

08:56.736 --> 08:59.504
<i>So I started to eat a lot and
I started gaining from that.</i>

09:00.239 --> 09:01.806
<i>At first, it was slow.</i>

09:01.808 --> 09:03.508
<i>It just seemed like I
was a little overweight.</i>

09:04.076 --> 09:05.710
<i>When I was 10 years old,</i>

09:05.712 --> 09:07.679
<i>I broke the 100-pound mark.</i>

09:07.681 --> 09:08.847
<i>And the difference in my size</i>

09:08.849 --> 09:11.149
<i>started to get hard to ignore.</i>

09:11.151 --> 09:14.753
<i>And I knew it was because
of how I ate, but I didn't care.</i>

09:14.755 --> 09:16.955
<i>Things got worse
with my stepdad.</i>

09:16.957 --> 09:18.757
<i>And I became the fat stepchild.</i>

09:18.759 --> 09:21.626
<i>The ultimate solution
was to get rid of me.</i>

09:21.628 --> 09:22.994
<i>So, as I was going
into middle school,</i>

09:22.996 --> 09:25.497
<i>I moved to be with
my grandparents.</i>

09:25.499 --> 09:28.233
<i>But I didn't mind because
I felt like they cared for me.</i>

09:28.235 --> 09:30.068
<i>When I lived at my
grandparents' house,</i>

09:30.070 --> 09:31.503
<i>my weight was pretty steady.</i>

09:31.637 --> 09:33.038
Because I wasn't

09:33.439 --> 09:34.906
seeking attention, you know, I
was getting attention at that time.

09:34.908 --> 09:38.043
My grandfather did stuff
with me and stuff like that.

09:38.045 --> 09:41.780
<i>And for the first time in my life,
I felt like I actually had a father,</i>

09:41.782 --> 09:43.882
<i>my grandfather.
I was happy.</i>

09:43.884 --> 09:46.117
<i>And things were
good for about a year.</i>

09:46.119 --> 09:48.720
<i>But a year into living with
them is when I found</i>

09:48.722 --> 09:50.221
<i>my dad wasn't my real dad.</i>

09:52.024 --> 09:54.025
<i>My real dad passed away.</i>

09:54.027 --> 09:56.127
<i>My grandparents
showed me the obituary.</i>

09:56.129 --> 09:58.463
<i>He had cancer, he was dead.</i>

09:58.465 --> 10:00.198
<i>And that's when
I ultimately knew that</i>

10:00.200 --> 10:03.602
<i>I would never have that relationship
that I was seeking as a child.</i>

10:03.604 --> 10:06.071
<i>So, I turned back to food</i>

10:06.073 --> 10:08.974
<i>to deal with that, because it
flipped my world to find that out.</i>

10:08.976 --> 10:10.909
<i>But then my grandpa got sick.</i>

10:10.911 --> 10:14.012
<i>As I started middle school,
he went to the doctor.</i>

10:14.014 --> 10:15.914
<i>That was on my 13th birthday.</i>

10:15.916 --> 10:18.316
<i>It happened so fast.</i>

10:18.318 --> 10:20.518
<i>He had cancer in
his foot and he was dead.</i>

10:20.886 --> 10:22.287
<i>It wasn't fair.</i>

10:22.755 --> 10:24.189
<i>From the day that they said</i>

10:24.191 --> 10:26.491
<i>he was terminal,
he lived six days.</i>

10:26.493 --> 10:28.193
<i>And it was over like that.</i>

10:28.195 --> 10:29.394
And that's...

10:30.096 --> 10:31.363
when everything changed.

10:32.098 --> 10:33.298
<i>I was devastated.</i>

10:33.300 --> 10:34.866
<i>I felt alone again.</i>

10:34.868 --> 10:36.134
<i>And what made it worse</i>

10:36.136 --> 10:38.970
<i>is that I had to go back
to living with my parents</i>

10:38.972 --> 10:41.573
<i>and sister and
be around Jeff again.</i>

10:41.575 --> 10:45.644
<i>So I just started eating a lot
again and I put on weight fast.</i>

10:45.646 --> 10:49.280
<i>I knew I did because, later that
year, I wanted to join the football team.</i>

10:51.050 --> 10:52.684
I had to take a
physical for football

10:52.686 --> 10:55.253
and I weighed in at 185.

10:55.255 --> 10:57.522
<i>But on top of that,
I wanted to be a running back.</i>

10:57.524 --> 11:00.692
<i>I wanted that position but
I couldn't run the ball.</i>

11:00.694 --> 11:03.061
<i>They told me,
"You're a lineman."</i>

11:03.063 --> 11:05.764
<i>And that stuck throughout
all my football years.</i>

11:05.766 --> 11:06.931
<i>But being labeled that</i>

11:06.933 --> 11:08.433
mentally destroyed me.

11:09.068 --> 11:11.770
<i>So that started me
on a downward spiral</i>

11:11.772 --> 11:13.672
<i>where I didn't really
wanna be around people.</i>

11:13.674 --> 11:15.974
<i>And all I did was
go home and eat.</i>

11:15.976 --> 11:19.177
<i>When I started partying, drugs
and alcohol with my friends,</i>

11:19.179 --> 11:22.013
<i>freshman and sophomore
year, I partied pretty hard.</i>

11:22.015 --> 11:24.516
I smoked a lot, I drank

11:25.051 --> 11:28.119
more than any
parent knows I did.

11:28.121 --> 11:30.755
<i>I was still
eating all the time, also.</i>

11:30.757 --> 11:33.925
<i>And that just got worse and
spiraled more out of control.</i>

11:33.927 --> 11:35.827
<i>By the time I was 17,</i>

11:35.829 --> 11:37.896
<i>I was already up to 300 pounds.</i>

11:37.898 --> 11:39.531
<i>But that was a bad year for me.</i>

11:39.533 --> 11:41.433
<i>Because that was my junior year,</i>

11:41.435 --> 11:45.837
<i>and I got caught with a
gram of marijuana at school.</i>

11:45.839 --> 11:48.373
<i>And that led to me getting
kicked off the football team.</i>

11:48.375 --> 11:50.975
<i>And that was the
icing on the cake.</i>

11:50.977 --> 11:53.144
<i>So that led me to
just keep spiraling.</i>

11:53.146 --> 11:55.146
<i>Where I just ate and
got high all the time.</i>

11:55.148 --> 11:57.515
<i>That's all I cared about, so...</i>

11:57.517 --> 11:59.117
<i>My weight continued to get worse</i>

11:59.119 --> 12:01.152
<i>and I continued using</i>

12:01.154 --> 12:03.955
<i>cocaine, other pills,
and opiates.</i>

12:03.957 --> 12:06.324
And then at that time is
was when I realized I

12:06.326 --> 12:08.293
really had a problem,
so I got clean

12:08.295 --> 12:10.061
and stopped using.

12:10.796 --> 12:12.997
<i>I was 18 then.</i>

12:12.999 --> 12:15.133
<i>And I knew things
were getting out of hand.</i>

12:15.135 --> 12:17.502
<i>So, I was headed in
a very bad direction.</i>

12:19.772 --> 12:22.474
<i>That's when I made
the huge choice to...</i>

12:24.810 --> 12:26.444
<i>To help change my environment...</i>

12:28.848 --> 12:32.150
<i>So when I was 18,
I quit school and</i>

12:32.152 --> 12:36.354
went to Job Corps in Yachats,
Oregon, to be a welder,

12:37.056 --> 12:39.090
and I excelled there.

12:39.092 --> 12:41.226
I got clean, 100%.

12:41.228 --> 12:43.628
<i>And, I ended up
being the dorm captain</i>

12:43.630 --> 12:46.865
<i>which was the highest ranked
student that you could be in the dorm.</i>

12:46.867 --> 12:48.800
<i>I was shop foreman
for the welding class.</i>

12:48.802 --> 12:50.034
<i>I was somebody there.</i>

12:50.036 --> 12:52.604
And that felt great, amazing.

12:52.606 --> 12:55.874
<i>But I was still eating
a lot and gaining a lot.</i>

12:55.876 --> 12:58.243
<i>That was the one thing
that never slowed down.</i>

12:59.979 --> 13:02.814
<i>So I was good until I
graduated the Job Corps</i>

13:02.816 --> 13:04.616
<i>and started looking
for a welding job.</i>

13:04.618 --> 13:06.751
<i>Because once I did, I realized</i>

13:06.753 --> 13:10.054
<i>there were already too
many unemployed wilders.</i>

13:10.056 --> 13:12.991
<i>And I just couldn't get work
to take care of myself then.</i>

13:21.133 --> 13:22.534
<i>I was 21 then,</i>

13:22.536 --> 13:23.968
<i>over 500 pounds,</i>

13:23.970 --> 13:26.471
<i>and I didn't wanna be in that
house with my stepfather.</i>

13:27.973 --> 13:29.274
<i>So every chance I could,</i>

13:29.276 --> 13:30.975
<i>I'd get out and get high,</i>

13:30.977 --> 13:32.310
<i>or go party.</i>

13:32.312 --> 13:34.112
<i>And I was more out
of control than ever.</i>

13:34.114 --> 13:35.479
<i>It was bad.</i>

13:37.216 --> 13:39.617
<i>Bad enough to where a
friend from high school, Jeremy,</i>

13:39.619 --> 13:41.019
<i>who lived in Montana,</i>

13:41.021 --> 13:44.389
<i>he'd see it over social media,
exactly what was going on.</i>

13:44.391 --> 13:45.957
<i>And he gave me a phone call</i>

13:45.991 --> 13:48.927
<i>and said, "Hey, man, I can get
you a job and I got a room for you.</i>

13:48.929 --> 13:51.362
Get over here."
And that's what we did.

13:51.964 --> 13:53.031
<i>Because I knew if I stayed,</i>

13:53.033 --> 13:55.099
<i>it could get even worse.</i>

13:55.101 --> 13:57.802
<i>And it gave me a chance to
get away from my stepfather.</i>

13:57.804 --> 14:00.038
<i>So I just told my mom that
I was moving to Montana.</i>

14:00.040 --> 14:01.940
<i>Got on a train, headed there</i>

14:01.942 --> 14:03.474
<i>to live with Jeremy
and his wife.</i>

14:05.544 --> 14:06.978
<i>And Jeremy was good to his word.</i>

14:06.980 --> 14:08.813
<i>So he got me a job
at a call center.</i>

14:08.815 --> 14:09.981
<i>And I was good at it.</i>

14:09.983 --> 14:11.950
<i>Being part of that
team felt great.</i>

14:11.952 --> 14:13.852
<i>And I felt good
about myself again.</i>

14:13.854 --> 14:16.054
<i>Like I did when
I was at Job Corps.</i>

14:16.056 --> 14:17.956
<i>And it was like that
for a few years.</i>

14:19.191 --> 14:20.859
<i>I was even able to save up</i>

14:20.861 --> 14:22.327
<i>and get a place on my own.</i>

14:22.329 --> 14:24.095
<i>And I felt independent again.</i>

14:24.230 --> 14:24.829
<i>So I was happy.</i>

14:24.831 --> 14:26.397
<i>But after a while,</i>

14:26.399 --> 14:29.534
<i>it just got to the point to where
they expected so much out of us,</i>

14:29.536 --> 14:32.003
<i>that we all got so stressed
out and overwhelmed.</i>

14:32.938 --> 14:34.906
<i>And that led me
to eating more again.</i>

14:34.908 --> 14:36.774
<i>So I gained even more weight.</i>

14:36.776 --> 14:37.876
<i>And when I was 25,</i>

14:37.878 --> 14:40.111
<i>I got to over 600 pounds.</i>

14:40.113 --> 14:42.447
<i>And I started to
struggle getting around.</i>

14:44.183 --> 14:47.118
<i>When one day, I was at
work and my boss came to me.</i>

14:47.120 --> 14:48.987
<i>And told me, I was
too fat to work for him</i>

14:48.989 --> 14:50.822
<i>and I couldn't come back to work</i>

14:50.824 --> 14:52.924
<i>until I got my
weight back closer</i>

14:52.926 --> 14:55.093
<i>to where it was
when I started, and...</i>

14:55.095 --> 14:58.029
I felt like I had just got
punched in the guts.

14:58.931 --> 15:01.099
<i>I was shocked
because all my hard work</i>

15:01.101 --> 15:04.302
<i>and all I had done for that
store meant nothing now.</i>

15:04.304 --> 15:07.005
<i>I mean, I felt like I lost.
I lost the battle.</i>

15:11.877 --> 15:13.378
<i>So what I did was</i>

15:13.380 --> 15:14.913
<i>I just stayed in my
place for a while</i>

15:14.915 --> 15:17.849
<i>and used all the money I
had saved up for food and rent.</i>

15:17.851 --> 15:20.184
<i>And just sat constantly
for a couple of years.</i>

15:21.787 --> 15:23.588
<i>So by the time I was around 28,</i>

15:23.590 --> 15:25.690
<i>I was over 700 pounds.</i>

15:25.692 --> 15:28.126
<i>And that is when I
started to become immobile.</i>

15:29.795 --> 15:32.864
<i>So my everyday life
was changed drastically.</i>

15:32.866 --> 15:36.000
<i>From, you know,
going outside and</i>

15:36.002 --> 15:40.104
<i>enjoying the outdoors to now
sitting in a chair and that's all I do.</i>

15:41.173 --> 15:42.540
<i>So I had gotten to a point where</i>

15:42.542 --> 15:46.044
<i>I couldn't take care of myself
anymore and I needed help.</i>

15:46.046 --> 15:48.613
<i>And I was also really worried
about my mom around then, too,</i>

15:48.615 --> 15:50.715
<i>because she finally got
the courage to leave Jeff.</i>

15:50.717 --> 15:52.617
<i>I was proud of
her for doing that.</i>

15:52.619 --> 15:55.453
<i>But I know it wasn't easy
for my mom to leave Jeff.</i>

15:56.722 --> 15:59.257
<i>But everything came
together when she met Leroy.</i>

15:59.259 --> 16:01.492
<i>Because he was able
to help provide for her,</i>

16:01.494 --> 16:03.461
<i>and in the end, me too.</i>

16:03.463 --> 16:06.698
<i>Because I was telling her I
didn't know what I was gonna do.</i>

16:06.700 --> 16:09.300
<i>And how I was gonna take care
of myself because of my size.</i>

16:09.302 --> 16:12.136
<i>And she said that she and
Leroy would move to Montana.</i>

16:12.371 --> 16:13.838
<i>So they moved up here,</i>

16:13.840 --> 16:16.841
<i>and I moved in with them so
they could help take care of me.</i>

16:16.843 --> 16:18.910

with my mom and Leroy</i>

depress me at times.</i>

<i>The fact that I'm 31 and
living with my mom. That's...</i>

16:51.377 --> 16:53.778
a pretty defeating feeling.

16:53.780 --> 16:55.480
<i>It's just like I failed.</i>

16:57.850 --> 17:00.885
<i>So I just eat to forget about
it and not think about it.</i>

17:00.887 --> 17:02.420
<i>But that's what's killing me,</i>

17:02.821 --> 17:04.522

be of that weight ever.</i>

<i>I could barely get around

17:21.807 --> 17:24.175
<i>So I'm just stuck in
this downward spiral</i>

17:24.177 --> 17:25.610

17:25.612 --> 17:27.345
<i>And how I can't give it up.</i>

17:28.313 --> 17:30.615
The relationship that
I have with food is

17:30.617 --> 17:33.985
kind of similar to the same
relationship I had with substances.

17:35.487 --> 17:38.423
<i>It's a way to escape, it's a
way to feel good for a moment.</i>

17:39.792 --> 17:43.061
<i>And it's an addiction like
other substances, but it's worse,</i>

17:43.929 --> 17:45.997
<i>because you can't completely
give up this addiction.</i>

17:45.999 --> 17:49.033
<i>No matter what,
you still have to eat.</i>

17:49.035 --> 17:51.969

to deal with, in my eyes.</i>

Food has, just like,
grasp on me.

17:57.042 --> 17:59.544
<i>And I think I lean on food
more than I did substances,</i>

17:59.546 --> 18:02.747
<i>because when I eat food, I
don't think about the substances.</i>

18:02.749 --> 18:06.017
<i>So, my food addiction helps
me resist other addictions.</i>

18:06.019 --> 18:08.719
So, it's one of those
addictions that I don't think

18:08.721 --> 18:10.221

20:31.063 --> 20:32.997
<i>How tall are you?</i>

20:32.999 --> 20:36.100
I'm six... 5'11" and
three quarters on paper.

20:36.835 --> 20:37.868
<i>Okay.</i>

20:37.870 --> 20:39.070
<i>Hmm, so,</i>

20:39.072 --> 20:41.973
<i>if all that information you
gave me is accurate,</i>

20:41.975 --> 20:44.976
<i>then your BMI is 103.</i>

20:44.978 --> 20:47.545
<i>Which is extremely
high and it means</i>

20:47.547 --> 20:50.014
<i>your body has
a lot of strain on it.</i>

20:50.016 --> 20:52.717
<i>And that it is a very
dangerous place for you to be.</i>

20:52.719 --> 20:55.953
<i>So how long have you
been overweight?</i>

20:55.955 --> 20:58.856
I've always been a
bigger kid my entire life,

20:58.858 --> 21:00.958
but when I turned 13--

21:00.960 --> 21:02.893
Was a day that a very tragic

21:02.895 --> 21:04.862
incident happened in my life and

21:04.864 --> 21:07.031
from 13 years old to now is when

21:07.033 --> 21:09.100
weight significantly
gotten worse.

21:09.102 --> 21:11.168
<i>You said something
tragic happened.</i>

21:11.170 --> 21:13.671
<i>Have you seen a
therapist for that?</i>

21:13.673 --> 21:15.940
Yeah, I have gotten help for it.

21:15.942 --> 21:19.944
<i>So, what seems to
be issue at this point?</i>

21:20.045 --> 21:21.512
I just think that

21:21.514 --> 21:23.848
moving to Montana was
one of the big things is

21:23.850 --> 21:25.149
I moved here and

21:25.151 --> 21:27.151
I don't have any friends here.

21:27.153 --> 21:29.654
Everything I've ever
had was in Oregon.

21:29.656 --> 21:31.122
My mom lives here now,

21:31.124 --> 21:33.824
so I'm just not nearly
as active as I once was.

21:33.826 --> 21:35.493
I used to go
hunting and fishing.

21:35.495 --> 21:36.927
And at least be out and about.

21:36.929 --> 21:40.698
You know, moving and Montana,

21:40.700 --> 21:42.500
you know, you have
snow on the ground

21:42.502 --> 21:44.068
five months out of the year.

21:44.070 --> 21:46.904
So there's that issues
from the fall factor

21:46.906 --> 21:50.541
and, uh, the last year prior
before reaching out to you,

21:50.543 --> 21:53.678
I just wasn't taking
care of myself

21:53.680 --> 21:56.180
and I let it get to where
it got out of hand

21:56.182 --> 22:01.052
and now I can't seem to get it
back under control by myself.

22:01.054 --> 22:02.987
<i>So long have you been
in Montana?</i>

22:02.989 --> 22:03.988
Five years.

22:03.990 --> 22:06.090
<i>So what brought you to Montana?</i>

22:06.092 --> 22:09.026
Uh, the friends that I was
hanging out with in Oregon

22:09.028 --> 22:12.196
decided to go down
a nasty dark path

22:12.198 --> 22:14.065
and I had the opportunity
to move over here

22:14.067 --> 22:14.832
with one of my friends

22:14.834 --> 22:16.801
that did here at the time.

22:16.803 --> 22:20.271
Um, so I wouldn't try
to follow them down that path.

22:20.273 --> 22:22.640
And so that's what I did.
I up and left Oregon,

22:22.642 --> 22:24.542
so I didn't make
the bad life decisions

22:24.544 --> 22:26.811
that my friends at the time
were making and came here.

22:26.813 --> 22:29.613
<i>So you moved
to Montana for friends?</i>

22:29.615 --> 22:32.283
<i>But now after five years,
you have no friends?</i>

22:32.285 --> 22:35.886
<i>And it snows a lot and you
overeat because of that?</i>

22:35.888 --> 22:37.922
I wouldn't say it like that.

22:37.924 --> 22:40.758
<i>However you say it, that's
what you're telling me.</i>

22:40.760 --> 22:41.726
<i>So it's concerning</i>

22:41.728 --> 22:44.895
<i>if you think those
are actual excuses.</i>

22:44.897 --> 22:47.932
My life's a lot harder
than you'd understand.

22:47.934 --> 22:51.535
<i>I heard that a lot of times.
But that's not the issue.</i>

22:51.537 --> 22:54.772
<i>The issue is whether you're
going to keep making excuses</i>

22:54.774 --> 22:58.542
<i>and blaming everything else
for your situation,</i>

22:58.544 --> 23:02.480
<i>or if you're ready to wake up
and get your life together.</i>

23:02.482 --> 23:05.316
I'm ready to do what I need
to get healthy, Dr. Now.

23:05.318 --> 23:08.953
<i>All right. So if food
is destroying your life,</i>

23:08.955 --> 23:12.823
<i>then what's seems to be
issues with your eating habit?</i>

23:12.825 --> 23:16.527
My eating habits now is,
just, I like pastas.

23:16.529 --> 23:17.895
It's a big--
Like, I say kryptonite,

23:17.897 --> 23:18.796
I guess I would say.

23:18.798 --> 23:20.731
I guess something
I have trouble with.

23:20.733 --> 23:24.435
I'm trying to wean off
of it and, uh, I eat late.

23:25.804 --> 23:27.738
So, I don't have a real schedule

23:27.740 --> 23:29.173
due to not being able to go out.

23:29.175 --> 23:32.076
So sometimes I eat
at six o'clock at night,

23:32.078 --> 23:34.011
sometimes I eat at midnight.

23:34.013 --> 23:35.679
And I know
that's a big part of it.

23:35.681 --> 23:37.181
<i>So what do you do all day?</i>

23:37.183 --> 23:39.984
Uh, usually I talk
to friends at home

23:39.986 --> 23:42.219
or play video games as of now.

23:42.854 --> 23:44.188
<i>Okay, and do you have any</i>

23:44.190 --> 23:46.056
<i>goal in your life?</i>

23:46.058 --> 23:47.992
Absolutely. I want
to get my life back.

23:47.994 --> 23:50.694
I want to loose weight
and be successful.

23:50.696 --> 23:54.832
Not have to rely on my mom
that I do now at 31 years old.

23:54.834 --> 23:57.968
And eventually, start my own
family and be independent.

23:57.970 --> 23:59.804
<i>All right.
So do you work?</i>

23:59.871 --> 24:00.938
As of now, no.

24:01.173 --> 24:04.141
I've been on disability.
But prior to that, I did work.

24:04.743 --> 24:05.809
<i>What did you do?</i>

24:05.844 --> 24:09.280
I was a wireless sales
consultant for cellphones.

24:09.915 --> 24:11.816
<i>And that was getting out
of the house</i>

24:11.818 --> 24:14.185
<i>and doing things
or was it online?</i>

24:14.187 --> 24:16.821
No, that was out of the house.
Eight hours a day.

24:16.823 --> 24:18.289
<i>So now you don't get out</i>

24:18.291 --> 24:20.558
<i>of the house
and you're on disability.</i>

24:20.560 --> 24:21.792
Yes.

24:21.794 --> 24:25.162
<i>So you are on disability
because of your weight</i>

24:25.164 --> 24:27.231
<i>or high blood pressure or what?</i>

24:27.233 --> 24:28.999
I'm on disability
because of my weight

24:29.001 --> 24:31.769
and being on high
blood pressure, yes.

24:31.771 --> 24:34.872
I can't stand for those long
periods of time anymore.

24:34.874 --> 24:36.907
<i>Okay. You sit at home
all day now?</i>

24:36.909 --> 24:38.008
Yes.

24:38.010 --> 24:41.045
<i>So who else is in the house
besides you?</i>

24:41.047 --> 24:44.181
There's me, my mom,
and my mom's boyfriend.

24:44.183 --> 24:47.318
<i>Okay, so is your mom working?</i>

24:47.320 --> 24:48.919
No, my mom is--

24:48.921 --> 24:50.120
She's always been
a stay-at-home mom,

24:50.122 --> 24:52.623
and her boyfriend
is also on disability.

24:52.625 --> 24:55.259
<i>So you all live off
of disability?</i>

24:55.261 --> 24:58.863
My mom is supported by her
ex-husband for alimony.

24:58.865 --> 25:01.999
<i>Okay, let's get back
to the goal in your life.</i>

25:02.001 --> 25:04.668
<i>You said you want to get
your life back and all that.</i>

25:04.670 --> 25:05.803
<i>Those are figure of speech.</i>

25:05.805 --> 25:09.507
<i>But what exactly you want to do</i>

25:09.509 --> 25:13.511
<i>or see yourself doing
10 years down the road?</i>

25:13.513 --> 25:14.778
Um, if I lost--

25:14.780 --> 25:16.413
Actually, I'm not
going to say "if."

25:16.415 --> 25:19.183
After, 'cause I'm committed
to this, I'll loose the weight

25:19.185 --> 25:20.985
and get back
to a healthy number.

25:20.987 --> 25:22.486
I want to be a fire fighter.

25:24.422 --> 25:26.056
<i>So you want to be
a fire fighter?</i>

25:26.058 --> 25:28.692
Yeah. That's my ultimate
dream, my overall goal.

25:28.694 --> 25:30.661
[sighs softly]

25:30.663 --> 25:33.230
<i>Okay. Well,
that's a good goal.</i>

25:33.232 --> 25:35.900
<i>But you obviously have
to get in shape for that.</i>

25:35.902 --> 25:37.167
I know. [sighs]

25:37.235 --> 25:40.037
<i>So for that, you're going
to have to do the hard work.</i>

25:40.039 --> 25:40.971
<i>You know that, right?</i>

25:40.973 --> 25:43.474
I do know that.
Yes, Dr. Now.

25:43.476 --> 25:48.212
<i>But still, what are willing
to do to get to that point?</i>

25:48.214 --> 25:52.550
I am as of now, I am willing to do
anything I have to do to get to that point.

25:53.251 --> 25:54.651
- I know...
<i>- Okay.</i>

25:54.653 --> 25:58.088
what's right around the corner
for me if I don't change my ways.

25:58.090 --> 26:03.027
And I-- That's-- I'm not
willing to die at my age

26:03.029 --> 26:05.262
so I'm willing to do
anything I can.

26:06.831 --> 26:10.734
<i>So you are committed
to make the changes</i>

26:10.736 --> 26:13.737
<i>to help your weight
and your health.</i>

26:13.739 --> 26:15.839
- Absolutely.
<i>- Okay.</i>

26:15.841 --> 26:19.176
<i>So what have you tried so far
that hasn't working?</i>

26:19.178 --> 26:22.913
Uh, I tried water aerobics
at one time to like--

26:22.915 --> 26:24.949
You know,
for the exercise aspect.

26:25.183 --> 26:26.951
And, um, that didn't work--

26:26.953 --> 26:28.852
I think what my
biggest problem is

26:28.854 --> 26:31.622
is I'm a very
goal-orientated person.

26:31.624 --> 26:33.057
So if I have someone telling me

26:33.059 --> 26:35.426
"Hey, Ryan,
you need to loose 10 pounds,

26:36.061 --> 26:38.963
you know, or this."

26:39.497 --> 26:42.399
But I've never
had the structure.

26:42.401 --> 26:44.101
I've always-- It's always been
like go do it on your own.

26:44.103 --> 26:46.870
I've never had a doctor tell me,

26:46.872 --> 26:47.938
"Hey Ryan,
you need to do this."

26:47.940 --> 26:49.540
I had a doctor here one time

26:49.542 --> 26:52.176
tell me that "Wow,
you're actually that big?

26:52.178 --> 26:54.979
Oh, you don't look that big.
I'm surprised."

26:54.981 --> 26:56.213
But that's no help.

26:56.915 --> 26:58.882
So, I just...

26:58.884 --> 27:01.919
I need to be accountable.
I just need to do it.

27:01.921 --> 27:04.722
<i>Okay. Well, Ryan you need</i>

27:04.724 --> 27:06.023
<i>to be under 200</i>

27:06.025 --> 27:08.626
<i>and you are over 500 pounds.</i>

27:08.628 --> 27:11.228
<i>And this extra 500 pounds,</i>

27:11.230 --> 27:15.165
<i>uh, is going to put a lot
of strain on your system.</i>

27:15.167 --> 27:17.935
<i>And most people at your weight,</i>

27:17.937 --> 27:19.703
<i>they don't survive too long.</i>

27:19.705 --> 27:20.938
<i>So can you tell me</i>

27:20.940 --> 27:22.172
<i>why haven't you done anything</i>

27:22.174 --> 27:24.141
<i>about it up to this point?</i>

27:24.809 --> 27:26.877
Well, I put myself on a diet

27:26.879 --> 27:27.878
that I'm on right now

27:27.880 --> 27:29.079
to loose weight.

27:29.081 --> 27:30.881
<i>So you're dieting right now?</i>

27:30.883 --> 27:31.882
Yes.

27:31.884 --> 27:33.117
<i>Okay. Is it working?</i>

27:33.119 --> 27:34.985
Yeah. It actually
has been working.

27:34.987 --> 27:37.888
I don't snack nearly
as much as I used to.

27:37.890 --> 27:41.959
<i>Well, if it is working and
you think you're losing weight,</i>

27:41.961 --> 27:44.795
<i>why did tell me you think
you're same weight</i>

27:44.797 --> 27:47.097
<i>as you were
a couple of months ago?</i>

27:47.966 --> 27:49.299
I'm just not sure
how much I lost.

27:49.734 --> 27:51.335
<i>Okay.</i>

27:51.337 --> 27:54.004
<i>So in a typical day,
what do you eat?</i>

27:54.006 --> 27:55.105
[Ryan exhales]

27:56.141 --> 27:57.041
Um, it really varies.

27:57.043 --> 27:59.309
Some days,
I'll personally order food

27:59.311 --> 28:01.979
like pizza or sandwiches
and have it delivered.

28:01.981 --> 28:03.113
And then other days,

28:03.115 --> 28:04.782
you know, my mom cooks.

28:04.784 --> 28:07.518
So eggs and sausages
is a big one for me.

28:07.520 --> 28:08.986
I like breakfast burritos,

28:08.988 --> 28:13.023
so I'll put eggs in it,
sausage in it, cheese in it.

28:13.525 --> 28:14.291
And I'll usually have

28:14.293 --> 28:15.826
two of those.

28:15.828 --> 28:18.929
And then dinner is chili,

28:18.931 --> 28:23.934
enchiladas, spaghetti,
like a lot of pastas, tacos.

28:23.936 --> 28:27.004
<i>All right.
So, do you snack?</i>

28:27.071 --> 28:28.906
Uh, I do still snack.

28:28.908 --> 28:32.509
Not nearly as much as I
was but I definitely snack.

28:32.511 --> 28:35.012
<i>But you cut back on the snacking</i>

28:35.014 --> 28:37.247
<i>because you're on
a diet you made up.</i>

28:37.515 --> 28:38.749
Yeah.

28:38.751 --> 28:39.817
<i>What do you snack on?</i>

28:39.819 --> 28:43.153
Crackers, uh, string cheese

28:43.155 --> 28:44.988
Any kind of popcorn.
It can be

28:44.990 --> 28:48.058
cheddar popcorn,
buttered, caramel.

28:48.827 --> 28:49.760
Anything like that.

28:49.762 --> 28:53.063
I chew on a lot of ice.
Like ice chips.

28:53.998 --> 28:56.200
Which isn't-- I'm sure
that's okay but--

28:56.202 --> 28:58.502
<i>You can have
all the ice you want</i>

28:58.504 --> 28:59.970
<i>but what else do you eat?</i>

28:59.972 --> 29:01.672
Um, some candy.

29:01.674 --> 29:02.940
I'm like-- I'm a sour guy.

29:02.942 --> 29:06.076
I like sour stuff so like
sometimes sour gummy bears,

29:06.078 --> 29:08.979
sour gummy worms,
or sour peak candy.

29:08.981 --> 29:10.948
<i>Okay.</i>

29:10.950 --> 29:13.117
<i>So you eat whatever
whenever, right?</i>

29:13.119 --> 29:14.017
Yeah.

29:14.019 --> 29:15.686
<i>Well, if you eat that,</i>

29:15.688 --> 29:18.055
<i>pretty soon you're gonna
hit 800 pounds.</i>

29:18.057 --> 29:20.958
<i>So with your stash,
who buys you those?</i>

29:20.960 --> 29:25.028
Uh, my mom and Leroy her
boyfriend go to the store for me.

29:25.030 --> 29:27.765
<i>So you give them the order
to buy what you want?</i>

29:27.767 --> 29:28.766
Yes, I do.

29:28.768 --> 29:31.769
<i>Okay. So can you
inform them</i>

29:31.771 --> 29:34.638
<i>that there'll be no
snacking from this point on?</i>

29:34.640 --> 29:36.240
Yes, I will definitely do that.

29:36.242 --> 29:38.709
<i>All right. Do you have any
brother or sister</i>

29:38.711 --> 29:40.144
<i>or anything like that?</i>

29:40.146 --> 29:42.913
I have a sister.
She still lives in Oregon.

29:42.915 --> 29:44.782
<i>Does she have any
weight problem?</i>

29:44.784 --> 29:46.150
No, she does not
have a weight issue.

29:46.152 --> 29:47.985
Her and I have different dads.

29:48.086 --> 29:49.920
My-- [exhales sharply]

29:49.922 --> 29:50.854
I don't want to make any excuse.

29:50.856 --> 29:51.889
A lot of my weight might be--

29:51.891 --> 29:54.124
My real dad when
he died at 40 years old,

29:54.126 --> 29:56.326
uh, was like over 800 pounds.

29:58.530 --> 30:02.099
<i>So you had one parent
that he was overweight.</i>

30:02.101 --> 30:03.534
- Yeah.
<i>- Right?</i>

30:03.536 --> 30:06.069
Yeah, and he had a heart
attack due to his health,

30:06.071 --> 30:07.704
like his being overweight.

30:07.706 --> 30:09.873
And then he also
had a drug problem.

30:09.875 --> 30:12.976
So those two went hand in hand
and he died at a young age.

30:12.978 --> 30:15.979
<i>How old was he when he deceased?</i>

30:15.981 --> 30:19.383
Uh, like, I think at 41.
Somewhere in there, 40-41.

30:20.318 --> 30:22.186
<i>So you're not too
far away from that, huh?</i>

30:22.188 --> 30:23.520
No. I'm not.

30:24.022 --> 30:25.055
<i>Okay, Ryan.</i>

30:25.057 --> 30:28.091
<i>If you want to make
any positive change,</i>

30:28.093 --> 30:29.927
<i>you're gonna have
to change your eating habit.</i>

30:29.929 --> 30:31.795
<i>You think you can do that?</i>

30:31.797 --> 30:34.097
I-- I definitely think
I can do that, Doc, yes.

30:34.099 --> 30:38.902
<i>Okay. All right, but let me make
something clear to you right now, Ryan.</i>

30:38.904 --> 30:41.805
<i>I can't magically
make you lose weight.</i>

30:41.807 --> 30:44.074
<i>You're gonna have to do
the hard work</i>

30:44.076 --> 30:46.043
<i>and change your eating habits.</i>

30:46.045 --> 30:48.178
<i>Because whatever
you are doing right now,</i>

30:48.180 --> 30:50.013
<i>clearly isn't working.</i>

30:50.015 --> 30:51.515
<i>So you think you can do that?</i>

30:51.517 --> 30:52.682
Absolutely.

30:52.684 --> 30:54.985
<i>All right. You need
to also understand</i>

30:54.987 --> 30:57.154
<i>that if you want
to do my program,</i>

30:57.156 --> 30:59.489
<i>you'll also need to move
out to Houston</i>

30:59.491 --> 31:00.624
<i>for at least a year.</i>

31:00.626 --> 31:04.895
Um, I am 100% willing
to transition. That's--

31:04.897 --> 31:06.930
Just to be honest with you
right now, that's a little bit--

31:06.932 --> 31:08.665
[exhales]

31:08.667 --> 31:11.501
Like I need a couple months to tie
up my loose ends here in Montana,

31:11.503 --> 31:15.739
but, uh, my family is on board with
me, as in my mom and her boyfriend.

31:15.741 --> 31:17.674
Um, we are ready to this.
They're more--

31:17.676 --> 31:19.943
They're 100% supportive
of me getting this help.

31:19.945 --> 31:23.046
So whatever has to happen,
I'm willing to do it.

31:23.048 --> 31:25.916
<i>Okay. Well, before you
come down here,</i>

31:25.918 --> 31:27.851
<i>I need to get
a current weight on you</i>

31:27.853 --> 31:29.119
<i>and get some tests done</i>

31:29.121 --> 31:30.787
<i>to see how your health is doing</i>

31:30.789 --> 31:33.223
<i>before you drive from Montana.</i>

31:33.225 --> 31:36.260
<i>So I will set up for you
to go a local clinic</i>

31:36.262 --> 31:37.861
<i>and let you know
when that will be.</i>

31:37.863 --> 31:39.696
<i>So we can do all that</i>

31:39.698 --> 31:42.866
<i>and then I'm gonna go ahead
and give you some instructions</i>

31:42.868 --> 31:46.003
<i>to start you on a diet
and exercise plan.</i>

31:46.005 --> 31:49.907
<i>We're gonna email you
some dietary instructions.</i>

31:49.909 --> 31:52.276
<i>So the first rule
we're gonna follow is</i>

31:52.278 --> 31:54.211
<i>that there'll be
no snacking, okay?</i>

31:54.213 --> 31:55.612
Okay.

31:55.614 --> 31:57.180
<i>So snacking is out.</i>

31:57.182 --> 31:59.249
<i>The second rule
I'm gonna follow is</i>

31:59.251 --> 32:01.184
<i>that you eat only
three times a day.</i>

32:01.186 --> 32:02.419
Okay.

32:02.421 --> 32:05.989
<i>And those three times,
400 calories per meal.</i>

32:05.991 --> 32:06.890
Okay.

32:06.892 --> 32:09.993
<i>There'll be no carb
on your diet.</i>

32:09.995 --> 32:12.462
<i>All is going to be
vegetable and protein.</i>

32:12.931 --> 32:14.131
<i>- Okay?
- Okay.</i>

32:15.099 --> 32:17.267
<i>Do you do any exercise?</i>

32:17.269 --> 32:19.069
Uh, no but I'm going to start.

32:19.071 --> 32:21.104
<i>All right.</i>

32:21.106 --> 32:22.439
<i>You think you can do that?</i>

32:22.441 --> 32:23.640
Yes, I do.

32:23.708 --> 32:27.010
<i>All right. So we're going
to email you all the stuff</i>

32:27.012 --> 32:29.680
<i>that you need,
and from this point,</i>

32:29.682 --> 32:32.115
<i>everything is going
to be up to you.</i>

32:32.117 --> 32:35.085
<i>And if you are motivated
to change your life,</i>

32:35.087 --> 32:37.020
<i>you're going
to be able to do this.</i>

32:37.022 --> 32:39.523
<i>But everything is going
to be up to you</i>

32:39.525 --> 32:40.724
<i>to make the changes</i>

32:40.726 --> 32:43.627
<i>and this is something
you need to understand.</i>

32:43.629 --> 32:46.063
<i>That you're in very
dangerous situation</i>

32:46.065 --> 32:48.198
<i>and your body's not
going to tolerate that.</i>

32:48.200 --> 32:49.132
<i>- Okay?
- Okay.</i>

32:49.134 --> 32:51.234
<i>If you're not able to do that,</i>

32:51.236 --> 32:52.936
<i>there is nothing
we can do for you.</i>

32:52.938 --> 32:55.138
<i>- Okay?
- Okay.</i>

32:55.140 --> 32:56.573
<i>I don't know how much you weigh</i>

32:56.575 --> 33:00.110
<i>but if you're about 700 pounds,</i>

33:00.112 --> 33:02.012
<i>if you stick with
the 1,200 calorie diet</i>

33:02.014 --> 33:03.981
<i>that we're going to send you,</i>

33:03.983 --> 33:06.249
<i>you're going to be
able to lose at least</i>

33:06.251 --> 33:08.018
<i>seventy pounds in one month.</i>

33:08.020 --> 33:09.186
<i>- Okay?
- Okay. Okay.</i>

33:09.188 --> 33:12.055
<i>So, at this point,
the starting point</i>

33:12.057 --> 33:14.057
<i>is going to be totally up to you</i>

33:14.059 --> 33:15.392
<i>to change your
eating habit, okay?</i>

33:15.394 --> 33:16.493
Okay.

33:16.728 --> 33:18.962
<i>So we'll set up somewhere
to get some tests done</i>

33:18.964 --> 33:20.430
<i>and check your weight</i>

33:20.531 --> 33:23.200
<i>and you can give me a call and
let me know how much you weigh.</i>

33:23.202 --> 33:24.901
<i>And then we're going to decide</i>

33:24.903 --> 33:26.103
<i>what will be the best
option for you.</i>

33:26.105 --> 33:27.904
<i>- Okay?
- Okay.</i>

33:27.906 --> 33:29.272
<i>All right, do you
have any questions?</i>

33:29.274 --> 33:31.274
No, that's--
No questions at this time.

33:31.276 --> 33:32.209
I'm just ready.

33:32.211 --> 33:34.711
I'm so ready to be able to

33:34.713 --> 33:36.980
walk and everything. [sighs]

33:36.982 --> 33:39.816
<i>Okay, well, what on earth
that happens</i>

33:39.818 --> 33:41.151
<i>is going to be all up to you.</i>

33:41.153 --> 33:41.952
<i>You got that?</i>

33:41.954 --> 33:43.053
Absolutely.

33:43.055 --> 33:45.989
<i>All right, Ryan,
it was nice talking to you</i>

33:45.991 --> 33:48.325
<i>and if you need anything</i>

33:48.327 --> 33:49.760
<i>before then, give me a call.</i>

33:49.762 --> 33:51.461
All right. Thank you
so much, Dr. Now.

33:52.430 --> 33:54.831
<i>You're welcome.
All right, bye now.</i>

33:54.833 --> 33:56.099
Bye-bye.

33:56.768 --> 33:57.701
[computer clicks]

33:57.703 --> 33:58.969

33:58.971 --> 34:01.038
<i>[Ryan] Dr. Now said
a lot of stuff,</i>

34:01.040 --> 34:02.873
<i>so I'm taking it
all in right now.</i>

34:02.875 --> 34:04.207
<i>I'm processing it.</i>

34:05.243 --> 34:07.044
<i>But I'm ready to do this.</i>

34:07.678 --> 34:09.012
<i>More than ready.</i>

34:09.014 --> 34:11.615
<i>Because I want
to get my life back.</i>

34:11.617 --> 34:15.619
<i>So no matter what it takes,
I'll move to Houston</i>

34:15.621 --> 34:19.289
<i>and show Dr. Now what he needs
so I can get on this program</i>

34:20.191 --> 34:22.526
<i>and change my life
before it's too late.</i>

34:43.147 --> 34:44.281
Hey, Leroy.

34:44.283 --> 34:45.449
[Leroy] Yeah.

34:46.350 --> 34:47.951
You about ready to go?

34:49.253 --> 34:50.921
Yup.

34:50.923 --> 34:52.689
I going to get my shoes on,

34:52.691 --> 34:54.157
but will you go warm up the car,

34:54.159 --> 34:56.026
'cause it looks
Arctic fresh out there.

34:56.028 --> 34:57.194
Yeah.

34:57.196 --> 34:59.029
And then I'll just
meet you out there.

I had a call with Dr. Now,</i>

to a clinic here in Montana...</i>

36:26.918 --> 36:28.451

36:34.826 --> 36:36.860

<i>And Leroy's driving me there
now to go do all that.</i>

36:40.932 --> 36:43.033
Is there any way that you can
put that heat on the floor, please,

36:43.035 --> 36:43.967
'cause I cannot feel my feet.

36:43.969 --> 36:45.335
Yeah.

36:47.605 --> 36:50.974
- Should I go around this way?
- Go right, yeah.

I'm good.
How are you?

37:29.514 --> 37:31.281
Good. I have an appointment

Okay.
Let's get you checked in.

Perfect.

I've got you checked in if you
want to have a seat over there.

37:40.826 --> 37:42.292

- Yeah.
- We're ready for you.

37:58.576 --> 37:59.976
- Perfect.
- I'm gonna have you come on back.

37:59.978 --> 38:02.279
- We're gonna get your weight.
- Thank you.

38:02.281 --> 38:03.546
- How are you today?
- Good. How are you?

38:03.548 --> 38:05.615
I am great.

38:05.617 --> 38:08.818
<i>I think the diet I put myself
on before talking to Dr. Now</i>

38:08.820 --> 38:11.054
<i>is gonna pay off
with the weight drop today,</i>

38:11.056 --> 38:14.024

a couple of months ago.</i>

38:14.026 --> 38:15.992

I'm less than that now.</i>

38:18.163 --> 38:20.163
Go ahead and step up for me.

38:20.898 --> 38:21.998
Perfect.

38:25.202 --> 38:29.673
Oh, I'm sorry, but it won't
read your weight today.

38:29.675 --> 38:30.974
I going to have you come in here

38:30.976 --> 38:32.942
and have a seat in these chairs.

38:32.944 --> 38:34.144
All right. Thank you.

in a couple of minutes

38:40.752 --> 38:42.819

vital signs. Okay?

38:42.821 --> 38:44.220

- You're welcome.

39:00.805 --> 39:02.205
Hello, Dr. Now.

39:02.207 --> 39:04.207
<i>Hi, Ryan.
How are you?</i>

39:04.209 --> 39:05.108
I'm good.
How are you?

39:05.110 --> 39:06.609
<i>I'm doing okay.</i>

39:06.611 --> 39:08.478
<i>So what's going on with you
and your weight?</i>

39:08.480 --> 39:11.981
Um, their scale cannot
read my weight.

39:11.983 --> 39:16.219
<i>The weight meter in the scale
they have seems to be 660 pounds.</i>

39:16.221 --> 39:17.987
<i>What we got is of your
exact weight.</i>

39:17.989 --> 39:20.390
<i>I'm gonna give you
the same goal.</i>

39:20.392 --> 39:24.794
<i>In two months, I want you
to get down to 650 pounds.</i>

39:24.796 --> 39:25.695
<i>You think you can do that?</i>

39:25.697 --> 39:26.930
Yeah, I think I can do that.

39:26.932 --> 39:30.166
<i>And if you stick
with a healthy you can</i>

39:30.168 --> 39:33.803
<i>lose that and easily get
under 650 in less than a month.</i>

39:33.805 --> 39:35.405
- Okay.
<i>- Okay?</i>

39:35.806 --> 39:39.709
<i>But if you still getting it wrong,
then you're likely in the low 700s.</i>

39:39.711 --> 39:41.611
<i>You are looking
at weight loss going off</i>

39:41.613 --> 39:45.248
<i>at around 60 to 70 pounds
over the next two months.</i>

39:45.250 --> 39:48.218
<i>You get to 650 and then we
can check your weight.</i>

39:49.120 --> 39:51.054
<i>So stick with the
healthy eating habit</i>

39:51.056 --> 39:53.289
<i>and do a diet and exercise.</i>

39:53.858 --> 39:54.924
<i>The diet and exercise</i>

39:54.926 --> 39:56.993
<i>three times a day, no snacking.</i>

39:56.995 --> 40:01.931
<i>And three times a day would
be about 400 calorie per meal.</i>

40:01.933 --> 40:04.167
<i>And we have protein, no carb.</i>

40:04.268 --> 40:05.735
- Okay?
- Okay.

40:05.737 --> 40:07.771
<i>And do some exercises</i>

40:07.773 --> 40:10.740
<i>an hour in the morning,
an hour in the afternoon</i>

40:10.742 --> 40:13.009
<i>and see if we can keep
your weight down</i>

40:13.011 --> 40:15.545
<i>as soon as possible to 650.</i>

40:15.547 --> 40:18.081
<i>And if you do that and
get to where your body</i>

40:18.083 --> 40:20.850
<i>can handle the trip
to over here to Houston,</i>

40:20.852 --> 40:22.452
<i>we'll set you on my program.</i>

40:22.454 --> 40:24.387
<i>- Okay?
- Okay.</i>

40:24.389 --> 40:27.824
<i>All right, Ryan, they're going to
try something new before you go,</i>

40:27.826 --> 40:31.761
<i>so we can see where you're at with
something and then you'll be done.</i>

40:31.763 --> 40:34.431
<i>But at this point, we need
to get your weight down,</i>

40:34.433 --> 40:37.734
<i>at least down to 650 pound.</i>

40:37.736 --> 40:39.002
All right.
That sounds good.

40:39.004 --> 40:41.838
<i>All right, Ryan, if you need
anything, give me a call.</i>

40:41.840 --> 40:45.642
<i>And start working hard on
your exercise and your diet.</i>

40:45.644 --> 40:49.112
<i>And see what kind of progress
you make in two months, okay?</i>

40:49.114 --> 40:51.147
All right, Dr. Now.
Thank you so much.

40:51.149 --> 40:53.450
<i>- All right. Bye now.
- Bye-bye.</i>

40:57.788 --> 40:59.522
<i>[Ryan] That's a big
amount to lose.</i>

40:59.524 --> 41:01.991
<i>So I feel like Dr. Now
is asking a lot from me,</i>

41:01.993 --> 41:03.760
<i>but I know I need this help</i>

41:03.762 --> 41:05.395
<i>and I have to change now.</i>

41:05.397 --> 41:07.197
<i>So I'm going to do it.</i>

41:07.199 --> 41:10.934
<i>Whatever it takes, I know I
have to do this and I can't fail.</i>

41:10.936 --> 41:13.369
<i>Because without this chance,
I have no hope at all.</i>

41:14.205 --> 41:17.240
<i>So I'll do what I have
to do to get it</i>

41:17.741 --> 41:19.209
<i>before my body gives up</i>

41:19.211 --> 41:21.177
<i>and something really
bad happens to me</i>

41:21.912 --> 41:23.813
<i>and I don't make it.</i>

41:23.815 --> 41:26.249
<i>Or I know something bad
is going to happen, too,</i>

41:27.051 --> 41:29.018
<i>and it's going to happen soon.</i>

41:34.492 --> 41:36.459
[mellow piano playing]

41:47.104 --> 41:50.273
<i>It's been a week since I
talked to Dr. Now the first time</i>

41:50.275 --> 41:52.509
<i>and started his diet
and exercise plan.</i>

41:53.677 --> 41:55.078
[coughing]

41:55.080 --> 41:57.514
<i>And I've been able to start
to make some of the changes</i>

41:57.516 --> 41:59.449
<i>to my diet, to eat healthier.</i>

42:19.837 --> 42:21.738
<i>But to say that there's
a lot of requirements</i>

42:21.740 --> 42:22.939
<i>and rules in what
Dr. Now sent</i>

42:22.941 --> 42:24.240
<i>would be an understatement.</i>

42:25.910 --> 42:29.245
<i>Because basically it's like
I can't eat anything anymore.</i>

42:29.847 --> 42:33.249
<i>Except meat, chicken,
fish and vegetables.</i>

42:34.652 --> 42:37.453
<i>And none of it can be made with
any thing that makes it taste good.</i>

42:38.656 --> 42:41.157
<i>No, butter or salt or anything.</i>

42:41.159 --> 42:43.059
<i>So basically I'm eating
like a rabbit.</i>

42:45.262 --> 42:46.563
<i>That's the diet.</i>

42:46.565 --> 42:48.965
<i>So that's not a simple
change for anyone.</i>

42:51.869 --> 42:53.703
<i>I think even someone
who's in perfect shape</i>

42:53.705 --> 42:55.004
<i>and always eats
healthy, they would</i>

42:55.006 --> 42:57.173
<i>have a hard time
with a diet like this.</i>

43:00.044 --> 43:02.045
<i>So I'm not doing it
perfectly right now,</i>

43:02.047 --> 43:03.713
<i>and I think that's
to be expected</i>

43:03.715 --> 43:05.448
<i>with something
as drastic as this.</i>

43:06.784 --> 43:07.817
<i>But I've made a lot of changes</i>

43:07.819 --> 43:10.053
<i>to how I eat that I'm proud of.</i>

43:10.055 --> 43:13.423
<i>Because even those have
taken a lot of will power to do.</i>

43:18.262 --> 43:20.997
<i>But that's how
committed I am to doing this.</i>

43:20.999 --> 43:22.599
<i>And I'm not
backing down from it,</i>

43:22.601 --> 43:24.334
<i>even though it's extreme.</i>

43:24.969 --> 43:28.771
<i>So I'm working on it
and I'm making progress.</i>

43:28.773 --> 43:31.975
<i>It's only been a week, but I'm
already feeling a little better.</i>

43:31.977 --> 43:34.210
<i>Like I have some
more energy when I get up.</i>

43:35.512 --> 43:37.847
<i>But I'm still not able
to be very active, yet.</i>

43:37.849 --> 43:40.583
<i>That's not my choice, though.</i>

43:40.585 --> 43:43.586
<i>That's because of the weather
and how much it has been snowing.</i>

43:43.588 --> 43:46.222
<i>And how that's iced over
the walkways and driveway.</i>

43:46.224 --> 43:48.591
<i>It's way too dangerous
for someone my size,</i>

43:48.593 --> 43:52.095
<i>to even attempt to try to walk
in these conditions.</i>

43:52.097 --> 43:55.064
<i>It could kill me because if I
slipped, it could take me out.</i>

43:55.499 --> 43:57.200
<i>And that'd be it for me.</i>

43:57.202 --> 43:59.969
<i>So I'm having to be safe
and wait to do the exercises</i>

43:59.971 --> 44:01.537
<i>until the weather improves.</i>

44:03.874 --> 44:06.242
<i>Because there's no room
to do it all, in here.</i>

44:06.810 --> 44:08.077
<i>The best I can do right now is</i>

44:08.145 --> 44:11.080
<i>I can manage to get on my
own feet, most of the time.</i>

44:11.082 --> 44:13.383
<i>So, I have to get up and
get some exercise then.</i>

44:14.985 --> 44:16.019
[clears throat]

44:18.055 --> 44:20.123
[coughs]

44:26.597 --> 44:27.897
<i>And I'm checking outside to see</i>

44:27.899 --> 44:30.667
<i>if the ice and snow
has gotten better.</i>

44:30.669 --> 44:34.937
<i>Because the second I am able
to safely walk outside, I'm doing it.</i>

44:36.073 --> 44:39.008
<i>But I feel here, how much I
am already doing on the roll.</i>

44:39.010 --> 44:41.110
<i>And my progress
I'm making because of that,</i>

44:41.112 --> 44:43.079
<i>even in just the first week.</i>

44:44.281 --> 44:45.782
<i>So, I have no doubt at all that,</i>

44:45.784 --> 44:47.216
<i>over the next couple of months,</i>

44:47.218 --> 44:50.286
<i>I'm gonna be able to get to
Dr. Now's goal on time.</i>

44:52.356 --> 44:53.990
<i>Even though it's a big one.</i>

44:53.992 --> 44:55.892
<i>So, me and my family
are making plans</i>

44:55.894 --> 44:57.493
<i>to move to Houston
in a few months.</i>

44:57.495 --> 45:00.663
<i>Because by then, I know
Dr. Now will have approved me.</i>

45:00.665 --> 45:04.867
<i>To go to Houston, and get weight
loss surgery, and do his program.</i>

45:04.869 --> 45:08.838
<i>I'm looking forward to that and all
the positive changes coming to me.</i>

45:08.840 --> 45:11.240
<i>Because I'm on a mission
to get my life back.</i>

45:11.242 --> 45:14.444
<i>And I'm not gonna back down
and rest until I do that,</i>

45:14.446 --> 45:15.978
<i>and succeed.</i>

45:31.895 --> 45:34.764
<i>[Ryan] It's been a month, since
I started Dr. Now's diet plan.</i>

45:34.766 --> 45:36.699
<i>Doing all that stuff
that he sent,</i>

45:36.701 --> 45:39.035
<i>to make progress,
and help me get to my goal.</i>

45:39.037 --> 45:41.771
<i>And I feel I've been
doing really well at it</i>

45:41.773 --> 45:43.806
<i>because I have made
a lot of changes,</i>

45:43.808 --> 45:45.241
<i>but my mom disagreed.</i>

45:45.743 --> 45:48.277
Ready for dinner?

45:48.279 --> 45:50.947
Yeah, can we have, like,
chicken and veggies, tonight?

45:50.949 --> 45:53.916
Yes, I can do it.
Are you gonna help?

45:53.918 --> 45:56.319
Yeah, I'll help you. Okay.

45:56.321 --> 45:58.821
<i>[Ryan] She thinks
I'm not doing enough.</i>

45:58.823 --> 46:00.923
<i>She told me that she thinks
I should be doing more,</i>

46:00.925 --> 46:03.226
<i>and I wasn't eating
healthy enough.</i>

46:03.228 --> 46:05.728
<i>So, she says that she's taking
control over some of my meals.</i>

46:05.730 --> 46:07.396
<i>So, I have healthier options.</i>

46:07.865 --> 46:12.101
<i>And she's making me help her, so I
have to get up to get some activity in.</i>

46:12.103 --> 46:15.371
<i>But most of what she's
prepared, hasn't been that great.</i>

46:15.373 --> 46:17.039
<i>So, I'm not really liking it,</i>

46:17.041 --> 46:21.043
<i>but I haven't complained because
I know this is what I have to do.</i>

46:21.045 --> 46:23.012
<i>No matter how bad
the food tastes.</i>

46:23.413 --> 46:24.614
<i>If I have to pick,</i>

46:24.616 --> 46:26.749
<i>I'd say that the grilled
chicken and vegetables</i>

46:26.751 --> 46:29.118
<i>as the meal I hate the least.</i>

46:29.120 --> 46:30.820
<i>It's not great
but it's not terrible.</i>

46:30.822 --> 46:33.756
I can use some of the
seasoning salt, right, a little bit?

46:33.758 --> 46:35.091
Instead of real salt?

46:35.093 --> 46:36.959
- [Ryan] Yeah.
- Okay.

46:36.961 --> 46:38.561
Okay, you got it.

46:38.563 --> 46:40.797
<i>[Ryan] My time on my feet
is still limited,</i>

46:40.799 --> 46:43.466
<i>because I still haven't been
able to do much of any exercising</i>

46:43.468 --> 46:45.601
<i>to build up my abilities.</i>

46:45.603 --> 46:48.538
<i>Even though it's not snowing,
it's hard, it's really cold outside.</i>

46:48.540 --> 46:51.407
<i>So, I still have to be safe
and careful about going out.</i>

46:52.810 --> 46:54.710
<i>So, I know I'm behind
with all that.</i>

46:54.712 --> 46:55.878
<i>And I still have
to take breaks from it,</i>

46:55.880 --> 46:58.815
<i>just to help with pain
and to catch my breath.</i>

46:58.817 --> 47:02.318
<i>But I can go for longer and I
think it's because I'm feeling lighter.</i>

47:03.620 --> 47:06.088
<i>What I had done before
my mom got involved,</i>

47:06.090 --> 47:08.658
<i>was I'd cut back from
my eating significantly.</i>

47:08.660 --> 47:11.527
<i>And then focused on things
like salads and stuff.</i>

47:11.529 --> 47:14.297
<i>I went through
all the to-go menus online.</i>

47:14.299 --> 47:16.833
<i>I made a list of all the healthy
options, so I could order.</i>

47:16.835 --> 47:18.367
<i>And I was the one
getting those meals</i>

47:18.369 --> 47:20.069
<i>for every meal,
everyday of the week.</i>

47:20.071 --> 47:22.305
<i>Except for Sunday.</i>

47:22.307 --> 47:23.840
<i>I was letting Sunday
be my cheat day,</i>

47:23.842 --> 47:28.277
<i>and I was researching how to
deal with all the drastic changes.</i>

47:28.279 --> 47:30.813
<i>And one of the articles that I
found, that was really helpful,</i>

47:30.815 --> 47:34.984
<i>suggested doing a cheat day, because
it helps to get over all your cravings.</i>

47:34.986 --> 47:37.787
<i>And stick to your diet, like,
the other 90% of the time.</i>

47:37.789 --> 47:39.455
<i>And I think, that has
helped me a lot,</i>

47:39.457 --> 47:42.091
<i>because I was completely sticking
to the diet the rest of the week.</i>

47:42.093 --> 47:45.494
<i>Without a single slip-up, and
I was making good progress.</i>

47:45.496 --> 47:48.664
<i>But I think my mom was just focusing
on what I was doing for my cheat day,</i>

47:48.666 --> 47:52.535
<i>and made a bunch of assumptions
that aren't right about how I'm doing,</i>

47:52.537 --> 47:55.538
<i>instead of understanding how much
I have cut back to change my diet</i>

47:55.540 --> 47:57.940
<i>and how well I've been doing
because of that.</i>

47:57.942 --> 47:59.709
<i>[Tammy] Is there
anything else you want, love?</i>

47:59.711 --> 48:01.944
No, that should be all right.
Thank you.

48:01.946 --> 48:03.579
<i>[Ryan] I can feel the progress
I've been making</i>

48:03.581 --> 48:05.081
<i>and I'm getting better</i>

48:05.083 --> 48:07.216
<i>so I know how I was doing it
is working.</i>

48:07.218 --> 48:09.252
<i>And that cheat day
actually helping.</i>

48:09.620 --> 48:11.254
<i>But she doesn't get that.</i>

48:11.256 --> 48:14.056
<i>And I know it's only because she
wants me to do good with all of this.</i>

48:14.058 --> 48:17.026
<i>So, I can do it my mom's way
for at least the next month.</i>

48:17.028 --> 48:19.061
<i>And I'm actually okay
with cutting back even more</i>

48:19.063 --> 48:20.329
<i>until my next weigh-in.</i>

48:20.331 --> 48:23.933
<i>Because I wanna make as much
progress as I can by then.</i>

48:23.935 --> 48:28.004
<i>So, I'm dealing with it all, I'm doing what
I need, to lose as much weight as I can.</i>

48:28.006 --> 48:29.939
<i>So, I figure, that's positive,</i>

48:29.941 --> 48:32.008
<i>because it shows
I'm making progress.</i>

48:32.010 --> 48:33.643
- Need a napkin or anything?
- No, this should be all right.

48:33.645 --> 48:34.777
- All right.
- Thank you.

48:34.779 --> 48:36.679
If you need anything,
holler at me.

48:36.681 --> 48:38.981
<i>[Ryan] So, I think if I keep
this up over the next month,</i>

48:38.983 --> 48:42.051
<i>I'll be ready to go show
Dr. Now my weight loss progress.</i>

48:42.053 --> 48:44.153
<i>And that I made it
to my goal in time,</i>

48:44.155 --> 48:45.855
<i>I know I'm on track to do that.</i>

48:45.857 --> 48:47.790
<i>So I'm feeling really good.</i>

48:47.792 --> 48:49.625
<i>And I'm fully confident
about how well I'm doing.</i>

48:49.627 --> 48:51.093
<i>I can feel it.</i>

48:51.095 --> 48:53.262
<i>So, there's no way I'm gonna
go back to the next appointment,</i>

48:53.264 --> 48:54.864
<i>and not have the result I need.</i>

48:54.866 --> 48:57.099
<i>That's not gonna be me.</i>

48:57.101 --> 48:59.035
<i>So, I'm actually looking
forward to next month</i>

48:59.037 --> 49:00.770
<i>and getting on the scale again</i>

49:00.772 --> 49:01.971
<i>to see all my hard work pay off.</i>

49:01.973 --> 49:04.874
<i>Because once
Dr. Now sees where I'm at,</i>

49:04.876 --> 49:06.776
<i>I'm gonna be able to take
a big step forward,</i>

49:06.778 --> 49:08.411
<i>to continue living
toward my goal.</i>

49:09.646 --> 49:11.314
<i>And make it to where I wanna be.</i>

49:22.059 --> 49:24.293
<i>I'm at the clinic again,
here in Montana,</i>

49:24.295 --> 49:25.895
<i>where Dr. Now has me going
to do my weight check.</i>

49:25.897 --> 49:29.131
[grunting]

49:29.133 --> 49:31.434
<i>The last couple of months,
got a little crazy for me.</i>

49:34.504 --> 49:37.273
[grunting] All right.

49:39.643 --> 49:42.511
<i>I have a friend, back in
Oregon, who's not doing well.</i>

49:42.513 --> 49:44.714
<i>And that's messed
with my vitality.</i>

49:44.716 --> 49:46.248
<i>It made me struggle a lot.</i>

49:50.120 --> 49:51.988
<i>[woman] Hi, Ryan,
how are you today?</i>

49:51.990 --> 49:54.690
- Good. How are you?
- We are good.

49:54.692 --> 49:55.791
- You're here for an appointment?
- Yes ma'am.

49:55.793 --> 49:58.127
Okay, I'll get you checked in.

49:58.129 --> 49:59.862
You wanna have a seat over
there, and we'll get you called back.

49:59.864 --> 50:02.231
All right. Thank you.

50:02.233 --> 50:05.768
<i>[Ryan] I know I've taken a
little longer to do my follow up.</i>

50:05.770 --> 50:08.804
<i>But it was hard for me
to justify focusing on me,</i>

50:08.806 --> 50:11.073
<i>when I have a friend,
who could be dying.</i>

50:12.142 --> 50:15.277
<i>But I've been trying and
working hard as much as I can.</i>

50:15.846 --> 50:18.047
<i>And I'm proud of
myself for doing that,</i>

50:18.049 --> 50:20.816
<i>despite what I've had to face
in my life, recently.</i>

50:20.818 --> 50:23.686
<i>I took something hard,
and didn't let it stop me.</i>

50:23.688 --> 50:26.789
<i>And I've even used it to
motivate myself even more.</i>

50:26.791 --> 50:28.624
<i>Because I wanna lose weight,
more than ever,</i>

50:28.626 --> 50:31.027
<i>so I can be there for them
other people I care about.</i>

50:31.029 --> 50:32.995
- Hi, Ryan. How are you doing?
- Hi. How are you?

50:32.997 --> 50:35.898
- I'm good. Things have been going good?
- Yeah.

50:35.900 --> 50:39.101
-You wanna come back with me? We'll get you back here.
-Absolutely.

50:39.103 --> 50:40.970
- Get your weight updated.
- [groans]

50:40.972 --> 50:42.071
[Ryan]
<i>And I think that alone shows,</i>

50:42.073 --> 50:43.806
<i>how committed I'm to this</i>

50:43.808 --> 50:45.508
<i>because it's been
a really hard time for me.</i>

50:45.510 --> 50:48.010
<i>And I've had to juggle a lot.</i>

50:48.012 --> 50:50.946
<i>But I'm still sticking with it
no matter how hard it's been,</i>

50:50.948 --> 50:51.747
<i>to resist the temptation,</i>

50:51.749 --> 50:54.216
<i>to just go to food for solace.</i>

50:54.218 --> 50:56.852
<i>So, I've done well, I'm just
hoping it all pays off now</i>

50:56.854 --> 50:59.021
<i>for the weight loss I need.</i>

50:59.023 --> 51:01.357
<i>So, I can keep moving forward,
and get my life back.</i>

51:13.437 --> 51:15.237
<i>I'm at a clinic here in Montana,</i>

51:15.239 --> 51:17.540
<i>to find out if I have lost what
Dr. Now wanted me to lose,</i>

51:17.542 --> 51:18.874
<i>to get to my goal.</i>

51:18.876 --> 51:21.610
<i>In my last appointment, the
scale couldn't read my weight</i>

51:21.612 --> 51:23.746
<i>because it has
a 660-pound limit.</i>

51:23.748 --> 51:25.915
<i>Dr. Now thinks
I was in the low 700's,</i>

51:25.917 --> 51:27.716
<i>because of
how I can get around still,</i>

51:27.718 --> 51:30.953
<i>but he gave me a goal,
to get down the 650.</i>

51:30.955 --> 51:32.655
<i>To make it safer for me
to travel to Houston.</i>

51:32.657 --> 51:35.324
<i>And so that the scale can
start to read my weight.</i>

51:35.326 --> 51:36.926
<i>And I think,
I've not only done that,</i>

51:36.928 --> 51:39.495
<i>but that I might even be much
lower than that today.</i>

51:43.200 --> 51:45.101
<i>[woman] We are going to
go right in this room here,</i>

51:45.103 --> 51:46.368
<i>and then let you have a seat.</i>

51:47.104 --> 51:48.070
[gasps]

51:48.072 --> 51:49.872
Take your time.

51:49.874 --> 51:50.906
[clears throat]

51:50.908 --> 51:52.108
[breathing heavily]

51:54.544 --> 51:55.978
[exhales]

51:56.813 --> 51:58.314
[Ryan]
<i>I don't understand that.</i>

51:58.316 --> 52:00.449
<i>I think the scale
is malfunctioning.</i>

52:00.750 --> 52:02.051
<i>It has to be,</i>

52:02.053 --> 52:04.086
<i>because I know
I've lost a lot of weight.</i>

52:04.088 --> 52:04.920
<i>So, that's not right.</i>

52:04.922 --> 52:06.956
<i>It can't be.</i>

52:06.958 --> 52:09.191
<i>But I don't know how Dr. Now
is gonna view this,</i>

52:09.193 --> 52:11.293
<i>and if he's gonna understand
how hard I worked.</i>

52:11.295 --> 52:13.229
<i>And how this can't be right.</i>

52:13.797 --> 52:15.164
[line ringing]

52:21.004 --> 52:22.271
Hello, Dr. Now.

52:22.273 --> 52:23.973
<i>[Dr. Now] Hey, Ryan,
how you doing?</i>

52:23.975 --> 52:25.141
I'm good. How are you?

52:25.143 --> 52:27.109
<i>I'm good. Thank you.</i>

52:27.111 --> 52:28.978
So, how's your weight
going today?

52:28.980 --> 52:30.513
I'm not sure.

52:30.515 --> 52:32.781
The scale's malfunctioning,
it won't give me a weight.

52:32.783 --> 52:34.683
<i>[Now] Is it malfunctioning</i>

52:34.685 --> 52:37.753
<i>or you are still over
the weight limit of the scale.</i>

52:37.755 --> 52:39.955
I know I made it
to the goal, Dr. Now.

52:39.957 --> 52:43.959
I worked hard. So, I'm at least
under 650 pounds right now.

52:43.961 --> 52:47.096
<i>So, you believe
you're under 650 pounds?</i>

52:47.098 --> 52:49.131
- That's correct.
- All right.

52:49.133 --> 52:51.267
<i>[Now] We will agree
to disagree then,</i>

52:51.269 --> 52:54.737
<i>because you don't know that you
have lost much weight since our last call.</i>

52:54.739 --> 52:56.772
<i>So, I think the issue is</i>

52:56.774 --> 53:00.976
<i>that you're still over the
660 pounds limit for the scale</i>

53:00.978 --> 53:02.811
<i>to be able to get your weight.</i>

53:02.813 --> 53:04.747
<i>So, whatever progress you made,</i>

53:04.749 --> 53:05.781
<i>it wasn't a lot.</i>

53:05.783 --> 53:07.082
<i>So, that's not good.</i>

53:07.084 --> 53:09.685
But the test we ran on you
last time

53:09.687 --> 53:12.154
showed that
it is safe for you to travel.

53:12.156 --> 53:13.889
So, you can make
the trip to Houston.

53:13.891 --> 53:15.925
So, just go ahead and...

53:15.927 --> 53:19.261
<i>See if you can come down
here soon and visit me here.</i>

53:19.263 --> 53:21.897
<i>We can check your weight
with our scale.</i>

53:21.899 --> 53:23.766
Okay. I can do that.

53:23.768 --> 53:28.003
<i>But it is still gonna be too much
for your body to go back and forth.</i>

53:28.005 --> 53:30.973
<i>So, if you come here,
you need to commit yourself</i>

53:30.975 --> 53:33.108
<i>to move down to Houston. Okay?</i>

53:33.110 --> 53:35.611
Yeah, I'm ready to move
to Houston, doc.

53:35.613 --> 53:38.280
<i>Okay. And you need
to also realize that,</i>

53:38.282 --> 53:40.749
<i>if you haven't lost
the weight by then,</i>

53:40.751 --> 53:43.085
<i>then we won't be moving
ahead with you.</i>

53:43.087 --> 53:44.386
<i>You understand that?</i>

53:44.388 --> 53:46.355
Completely, Dr. Now.

53:46.357 --> 53:49.491
<i>All right, we're still gonna set
appointments for you for two months,</i>

53:49.493 --> 53:52.061
<i>and you need to lose
another 60 pounds,</i>

53:52.063 --> 53:53.696
<i>to get under 600.</i>

53:53.698 --> 53:55.064
Okay. that sounds good.

53:55.066 --> 53:58.767
<i>So, you realize if you haven't
lost the weight like you think,</i>

53:58.769 --> 54:01.937
<i>that's gonna be a lot of
weight for you to lose by then.</i>

54:01.939 --> 54:03.906
I understand, Dr. Now.
And I'm gonna do it.

54:03.908 --> 54:06.275
<i>All right. See you then, okay.</i>

54:06.277 --> 54:08.310
All right. That sounds good.
Thank you so much.

54:08.545 --> 54:09.611
<i>And you may...</i>

54:09.613 --> 54:11.981
<i>I think, between
your diet and exercises,</i>

54:11.983 --> 54:15.284
<i>we're gonna get some
updated testing before you go,</i>

54:15.286 --> 54:18.821
<i>to make sure nothing has
changed in the past few months.</i>

54:18.823 --> 54:19.722
Okay.

54:19.724 --> 54:21.090
<i>And then let me know,</i>

54:21.092 --> 54:23.325
<i>when you plan
to come to Houston, okay?</i>

54:23.327 --> 54:25.060
I will, Dr. Now.

54:25.062 --> 54:27.730
<i>Don't take too long,
because if you do,</i>

54:27.732 --> 54:29.999
<i>then we're gonna need
to do another appointment,</i>

54:30.001 --> 54:31.834
<i>to do a self-testing,
to make sure</i>

54:31.836 --> 54:33.802
<i>you can still handle the trip.</i>

54:33.804 --> 54:36.939
<i>So, don't take too much time,
if you want to do this.</i>

54:36.973 --> 54:37.873
I won't, Dr. Now.

54:37.875 --> 54:39.775
I'm coming as soon as I can.

54:39.777 --> 54:42.011
Me and my family have already
been working on doing that

54:42.013 --> 54:44.947
so it won't be too hard to
figure out moving there soon.

54:44.949 --> 54:47.116
<i>Okay, so check your
eating habits</i>

54:47.118 --> 54:48.784
<i>and work hard</i>

54:48.786 --> 54:51.153
<i>and I'll see you when you
come down to Houston, okay?</i>

54:51.155 --> 54:53.522
That sounds good.
Thank you so much, Dr. Now.

54:53.524 --> 54:56.725
<i>All right. Stick with your
exercise and your diet, okay?</i>

54:56.727 --> 54:57.493
All right.

54:58.128 --> 54:59.962
<i>All right. We'll see you then.</i>

54:59.964 --> 55:01.497
All right. Thank you so much.
Bye-bye.

55:01.898 --> 55:03.232
<i>Bye bye.</i>

55:04.734 --> 55:06.602
<i>[Ryan] I was a little worried
before the call</i>

55:06.604 --> 55:09.004
<i>because I didn't know how
Dr. Now was gonna react.</i>

55:09.006 --> 55:10.906
<i>Or if he was gonna understand
how hard I've worked</i>

55:10.908 --> 55:13.042
<i>with the scale not showing it.</i>

55:13.044 --> 55:15.144
<i>So, I'm glad that he knows
I'm ready to go to Houston.</i>

55:15.146 --> 55:17.146
<i>Because I'm ready to
take some big steps</i>

55:17.148 --> 55:18.947
<i>to get closer to a better life.</i>

55:19.749 --> 55:21.317
- Hi.
- Hi.

55:21.319 --> 55:23.018
We're gonna get
your vitals here.

55:23.020 --> 55:24.787
Okay.

55:24.789 --> 55:26.555
<i>[Ryan] And I think,
once I get there to Houston,</i>

55:26.557 --> 55:28.891
<i>I'll be able to show
Dr. Now even more progress.</i>

55:28.893 --> 55:31.860
<i>So, I'm very excited
and I'm ready to do this.</i>

55:31.862 --> 55:34.963
Any changes in your overall
health? Any chest pain?

55:34.965 --> 55:37.633
- Nothing like that. No.
- Okay.

55:37.635 --> 55:39.735
<i>[Ryan] The new goal
he gave me is a lot.</i>

55:39.737 --> 55:41.503
<i>Bit I know
I can rise that challenge</i>

55:41.505 --> 55:42.871
<i>because I have so far.</i>

55:42.873 --> 55:45.107
<i>So, my plan is to keep doing,
what I'm doing,</i>

55:45.109 --> 55:46.408
<i>and make my progress.</i>

55:46.410 --> 55:47.843
<i>And me and
my family's gonna work</i>

55:47.877 --> 55:50.646
<i>on getting ready to move to
Houston as soon as possible.</i>

55:50.648 --> 55:52.715
<i>So, I can keep this
journey going.</i>

55:52.717 --> 55:55.084
<i>And lose even more weight
and get to where I wanna be.</i>

55:55.086 --> 55:56.885
<i>And I'm excited about that.</i>

55:56.887 --> 55:58.287
- Take care.
- You too.

56:02.158 --> 56:03.425
[exhales]

56:10.066 --> 56:11.667
[doorbell ringing]

56:11.669 --> 56:13.068
<i>[Ryan] After my appointment
yesterday,</i>

56:13.070 --> 56:15.771
<i>I came home and told my
mom and Leroy the good news,</i>

56:15.773 --> 56:18.040
<i>that Dr. Now says,
I'm ready to go to Houston.</i>

56:18.042 --> 56:20.075
<i>That we need to figure out
our move down there.</i>

56:20.077 --> 56:22.211
<i>Because I want to go
as soon as possible.</i>

56:22.213 --> 56:24.246
<i>So, we need to start
getting ready for that.</i>

56:25.014 --> 56:26.215
[man] Hey, how are you?

56:26.217 --> 56:27.983
Good. Thank you.

56:28.918 --> 56:30.652
<i>[Ryan] They said,
they were proud of me.</i>

56:30.654 --> 56:33.422
<i>And excited that I'm gonna be
able to get the help I need.</i>

56:34.891 --> 56:36.992
<i>So, it was a good day
and it felt really great too.</i>

56:36.994 --> 56:39.128
<i>I don't always see
all my hard work pay off,</i>

56:39.130 --> 56:41.330
<i>but tonight my mom
and Leroy were proud of me.</i>

56:43.566 --> 56:44.867
<i>So, the next step for me,</i>

56:44.869 --> 56:46.735
<i>is to decide one of
the apartment options</i>

56:46.737 --> 56:48.804
<i>in Houston, so that
we can move there.</i>

56:48.806 --> 56:50.839
<i>And to keep working hard
to lose the next goal amount</i>

56:50.841 --> 56:51.974
<i>that Dr. Now gave me.</i>

56:51.976 --> 56:54.343
<i>So, when I get there,
I'm down to 590.</i>

56:57.647 --> 56:59.515
<i>But now that I made it
to this point,</i>

56:59.517 --> 57:02.084
<i>I need to go back to
how I was doing the diet,</i>

57:02.086 --> 57:03.619
<i>before my mom intervened,</i>

57:03.621 --> 57:05.954
<i>where I had my cheat days.</i>

57:05.956 --> 57:08.624
<i>Because that got me through
the first month of doing this.</i>

57:08.626 --> 57:10.025
<i>And not being able to have that,</i>

57:10.027 --> 57:12.895
<i>made the last couple of months
way too hard.</i>

57:12.897 --> 57:15.364
<i>I invited myself to
go back to my way,</i>

57:15.366 --> 57:17.966
<i>and enjoy one day of week
with whatever I want.</i>

57:17.968 --> 57:19.601
<i>I just wanna enjoy something</i>

57:19.603 --> 57:21.637
<i>that tastes good
and makes me feel good.</i>

57:21.639 --> 57:23.238
<i>And that'll get me through
the rest of the week.</i>

57:23.240 --> 57:25.040
<i>I keep doing the diet
and stay on track,</i>

57:25.042 --> 57:27.509
<i>like I need to
get to my next goal.</i>

57:29.245 --> 57:31.313
<i>[Leroy] Honey,
better come and see this.</i>

57:36.686 --> 57:38.353
[Leroy] Right.

57:38.355 --> 57:40.689
<i>[Ryan] I didn't tell my mom because I
knew she wasn't gonna agree with me.</i>

57:40.691 --> 57:42.157
<i>And I didn't wanna argue.</i>

57:42.425 --> 57:45.227
<i>So, I waited until she and Leroy
told me they were taking a nap,</i>

57:45.229 --> 57:47.496
<i>and they wouldn't hear the
door. But, I guess, they weren't.</i>

57:49.098 --> 57:50.933
Ryan cheating?

57:50.935 --> 57:53.902
- What are you doing?
- I was just...

57:53.904 --> 57:56.038
- Eating some chicken.
- I'm making dinner!

57:56.040 --> 57:57.272
[exhales] Okay.

57:57.274 --> 58:00.442
So, the dogs will have chicken
for their dinner.

58:02.812 --> 58:04.246
This is not on your diet.

58:05.815 --> 58:07.015
[Ryan] Snitch.

58:07.017 --> 58:09.585
[Ryan]
<i>I'm a little frustrated.</i>

58:09.587 --> 58:11.954
<i>Because I don't think that
I'm doing anything wrong.</i>

58:15.091 --> 58:17.659
<i>I know what I'm doing,
and I'm doing good.</i>

58:17.661 --> 58:18.827
<i>My mom and Leroy
think they're helping.</i>

58:18.829 --> 58:20.929
<i>But they don't understand
how this works.</i>

58:20.931 --> 58:25.000
<i>And how I need to do this in a way
I can maintain for the rest of my life.</i>

58:25.002 --> 58:27.102
<i>Because cutting out
everything isn't sustainable.</i>

58:27.104 --> 58:29.104
<i>So, I have to find a balance.</i>

58:29.106 --> 58:31.139
I don't know what
we're gonna do about this.

58:31.808 --> 58:33.275
What can I do to help you?

58:33.843 --> 58:35.177
You know...

58:35.179 --> 58:37.279
If you do need help, it's okay.

58:37.281 --> 58:37.980
I know.

58:37.982 --> 58:39.815
I appreciate it.

58:39.817 --> 58:42.384
Every step back's like, you
gotta take five more steps forward,

58:42.386 --> 58:44.152
than you had to take before.

58:44.220 --> 58:46.021
I get it.

58:46.023 --> 58:48.056
Makes me worry about you more.

58:48.124 --> 58:50.259
I know, if I'm worried,

58:50.261 --> 58:52.528
you know,
your mom's falling apart.

58:55.532 --> 58:57.199
I get that.

58:57.201 --> 59:00.269
<i>It's a waste of time to argue,
so I don't waste my breath.</i>

59:01.905 --> 59:03.972
<i>But I'm committed to losing
the weight and getting healthy,</i>

59:03.974 --> 59:05.974
<i>so, I'll figure out
how to do this,</i>

59:05.976 --> 59:08.343
<i>in a way I can maintain,
so I can keep going.</i>

59:08.845 --> 59:10.178
<i>With how good I feel,</i>

59:10.180 --> 59:13.015
<i>I know I've made
a lot of progress already.</i>

59:13.017 --> 59:14.783
<i>And I'm not gonna mess it up.</i>

59:14.785 --> 59:15.884
The salad is good.

59:15.886 --> 59:17.986
But it's not a chicken strip.

59:17.988 --> 59:20.122
I understand
your cravings, but...

59:20.823 --> 59:22.190
We have a goal here.

59:23.059 --> 59:25.861
And we need to stick to it.

59:25.863 --> 59:26.929
<i>[Ryan] With how good I feel,</i>

59:26.931 --> 59:29.197
<i>I know I've made
a lot of progress already.</i>

59:29.199 --> 59:30.999
<i>And I'm not gonna mess it up.</i>

59:31.001 --> 59:32.100
<i>That's what they don't get,</i>

59:32.102 --> 59:33.902
<i>is that I'm not
gonna do anything</i>

59:33.904 --> 59:35.571
<i>to go back
in the wrong direction,</i>

59:35.573 --> 59:37.506
<i>and start gaining again.</i>

59:37.508 --> 59:39.675
<i>I'm proud of how I'm doing
and I wanna keep going</i>

59:39.677 --> 59:42.210
<i>to lose even more
and make it to my next goal,</i>

59:42.212 --> 59:44.513
<i>by the time we all
move to Houston.</i>

59:44.515 --> 59:47.115
<i>So, I'm just gonna focus
on doing that, the best I can.</i>

59:47.117 --> 59:49.918
I will help you however I can.

59:49.920 --> 59:52.321
I need to lock stuff
or whatever,

59:52.323 --> 59:53.522
I will do that.

59:53.723 --> 59:55.023
Okay.

59:55.025 --> 59:57.559
<i>And if I find some time to
get a cheat meal in, I will.</i>

59:57.561 --> 1:00:00.062
<i>Although as I'll do my best
to do it how my mom wants,</i>

1:00:00.064 --> 1:00:03.098
<i>only because I know,
she's just trying to help me.</i>

1:00:03.100 --> 1:00:04.833
This is actually really good,
Mom, thank you.

1:00:04.835 --> 1:00:06.768
You are very welcome.

1:00:06.770 --> 1:00:08.637
<i>[Ryan] We have more important
things to focus on,</i>

1:00:08.639 --> 1:00:09.671
<i>like our move to Houston.</i>

1:00:09.673 --> 1:00:11.506
<i>That's gonna take
a while for us to do.</i>

1:00:11.508 --> 1:00:13.575
<i>Because I have to pick a place
for us to live there.</i>

1:00:13.577 --> 1:00:16.044
<i>Then we have to pack all of
our stuff and move down there.</i>

1:00:16.046 --> 1:00:18.480
<i>So, I'm just gonna put my
energy towards doing all that,</i>

1:00:18.482 --> 1:00:19.948
<i>so I can keep moving forward.</i>

1:00:19.950 --> 1:00:22.951
<i>Do Dr. Now's program
and get weight loss surgery.</i>

1:00:22.953 --> 1:00:25.053
Now, we take it
one day at a time.

1:00:25.055 --> 1:00:27.889
Yeah. And we will
beat this thing.

1:00:27.891 --> 1:00:29.925
We will be in Cancun...
[mumbles]

1:00:29.927 --> 1:00:31.994
I sure hope so.

1:00:31.996 --> 1:00:32.861
<i>[Ryan] So, I'm gonna keep
working my hardest,</i>

1:00:32.863 --> 1:00:35.364
<i>and get over
how frustrated I feel.</i>

1:00:35.366 --> 1:00:38.333
<i>Because my priority is on getting
healthy and starting a new life.</i>

1:00:38.335 --> 1:00:39.501
[exhales]

1:00:40.169 --> 1:00:41.570
[grunts]

1:00:41.572 --> 1:00:44.373
<i>[Ryan] And doing whatever I
have to do to make it happen.</i>

1:00:57.887 --> 1:00:59.988
<i>My mom caught me trying to eat
another cheat meal.</i>

1:00:59.990 --> 1:01:01.890
<i>It wasn't even
a whole cheat day.</i>

1:01:01.892 --> 1:01:03.759
<i>It was just one meal,
and she got upset</i>

1:01:03.761 --> 1:01:05.527
<i>and we sort of
went at it for a bit.</i>

1:01:05.529 --> 1:01:07.129
<i>Because I don't think
any of this is fair.</i>

1:01:07.131 --> 1:01:09.097
<i>I told her I need
to do this diet in a way</i>

1:01:09.099 --> 1:01:11.066
<i>that works for me
to be successful.</i>

1:01:11.068 --> 1:01:12.668
<i>But she doesn't care.</i>

1:01:12.670 --> 1:01:14.569
<i>So, now she's decided
the best thing to do,</i>

1:01:14.571 --> 1:01:16.505
<i>is throw out anything
in the house,</i>

1:01:16.507 --> 1:01:20.108
<i>with carbs and sugar or anything
that's not on Dr. Now's diet.</i>

1:01:20.110 --> 1:01:21.810
<i>That's basically
everything in the house,</i>

1:01:21.812 --> 1:01:23.211
<i>and she's throwing it all away.</i>

1:01:23.213 --> 1:01:25.047
It's gonna be a lot of food.

1:01:25.049 --> 1:01:27.082
I hope this helps you, bub.

1:01:27.517 --> 1:01:29.517
There's a lot of stuff in here.

1:01:29.519 --> 1:01:32.387
<i>[Ryan] So, I'm frustrated right now, because
I don't think any of this is helpful.</i>

1:01:32.389 --> 1:01:34.890
<i>I know my mom thinks it is,
but she's wrong.</i>

1:01:34.892 --> 1:01:36.491
<i>It's gonna make this
harder for me.</i>

1:01:36.493 --> 1:01:37.993
<i>I guess I just have
to deal with it</i>

1:01:37.995 --> 1:01:40.395
<i>because I don't have
any other option right now.</i>

1:01:40.397 --> 1:01:42.197
[Tammy] None
of this stuff is mine.

1:01:42.199 --> 1:01:44.166
<i>[Ryan] But it's hard
for me to even watch.</i>

1:01:44.168 --> 1:01:45.734
Holy smokes,
that's a lot of food.

1:01:45.801 --> 1:01:47.569
I know.

1:01:47.571 --> 1:01:49.237
<i>[Ryan] Despite being forced
to doing this in a way,</i>

1:01:49.239 --> 1:01:50.906
<i>that makes it harder
than it should be,</i>

1:01:50.908 --> 1:01:51.840
<i>I'm sticking with it.</i>

1:01:51.842 --> 1:01:52.874
<i>I'm not going to argue with her.</i>

1:01:52.876 --> 1:01:54.810
<i>I'll just do it her way,
for now.</i>

1:01:54.812 --> 1:01:57.579
<i>But so far, I know I've made
some really good progress.</i>

1:01:57.581 --> 1:01:59.681
<i>And I know I'm gonna
make a lot more.</i>

1:01:59.683 --> 1:02:01.717
<i>So, I feel like I'm gonna be
able to get to my next goal</i>

1:02:01.719 --> 1:02:04.052
<i>by the time I go see
Dr. Now in Houston.</i>

1:02:04.054 --> 1:02:06.588
<i>My mom, Leroy and I are
working on moving our whole lives</i>

1:02:06.590 --> 1:02:09.257
<i>down to Houston,
in the next couple months.</i>

1:02:09.259 --> 1:02:11.460
<i>I wanted to do it sooner,
but it's just not feasible</i>

1:02:11.462 --> 1:02:13.261
<i>with everything that
we have to figure out.</i>

1:02:13.263 --> 1:02:15.997
<i>With getting everything wrapped
up here and then finding a place,</i>

1:02:15.999 --> 1:02:18.233
<i>and packing everything up
and taking it all to Houston,</i>

1:02:18.235 --> 1:02:19.701
<i>it's a lot.</i>

1:02:19.703 --> 1:02:21.770
<i>So, it's unrealistic of me to
think we could do that quickly.</i>

1:02:21.772 --> 1:02:25.140
<i>Because it's been tough, even
figuring out where we're gonna live.</i>

1:02:25.142 --> 1:02:28.410
<i>I've narrowed it down to the three
different apartments we can afford.</i>

1:02:28.412 --> 1:02:30.879
<i>But honestly,
none of them are my favorite.</i>

1:02:30.881 --> 1:02:33.014
<i>They seem to be crammed and I'm
worried about having enough space</i>

1:02:33.016 --> 1:02:34.049
<i>to get around in them.</i>

1:02:34.051 --> 1:02:35.851
<i>And I'm holding out
a little longer</i>

1:02:35.853 --> 1:02:37.919
<i>to see if we can find
something better for me.</i>

1:02:37.921 --> 1:02:40.355
<i>It'll just make it easier
on me in the end.</i>

1:02:40.357 --> 1:02:42.023
I got all the food wrapped.

1:02:42.025 --> 1:02:42.858
There you go.

1:02:42.860 --> 1:02:44.493
- Donate it.
- [Tammy] Yeah.

1:02:45.161 --> 1:02:46.995
Hopefully,
now you can start buying,

1:02:46.997 --> 1:02:48.964
like, better stuff for me.

1:02:49.999 --> 1:02:51.466
Will Dr. Now give you a list?

1:02:52.235 --> 1:02:54.136
- I'm hoping.
- Of something you can eat.

1:02:54.138 --> 1:02:54.870
Yeah. I'm hoping.

1:02:54.872 --> 1:02:56.772
Can we support that?

1:02:56.774 --> 1:02:59.541
I know that I can't snack or
anything. So, it's just gonna...

1:02:59.543 --> 1:03:01.743
Be chicken and veggies.

1:03:01.745 --> 1:03:04.246
So, I don't-- Really don't see why the
stuff won't go on the shelf from here on out

1:03:04.248 --> 1:03:06.081
In the end, it'll be good.

1:03:06.415 --> 1:03:08.150
Get you anything tonight?

1:03:08.152 --> 1:03:09.918
- You got water?
- Nothing else.

1:03:09.920 --> 1:03:11.353
Okay.

1:03:11.355 --> 1:03:13.989
<i>[Ryan] But overall, we're making
progress and we'll get it done.</i>

1:03:13.991 --> 1:03:15.857
<i>Because I'm determined
to keep moving forward,</i>

1:03:15.859 --> 1:03:17.692
<i>and my family wants
me to get this help,</i>

1:03:17.694 --> 1:03:19.861
<i>so I wanna get this all
figured out too.</i>

1:03:19.863 --> 1:03:22.998
Okay, if you need me,
just scream.

1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:24.366
- No. Thank you.
- Come on, baby girl.

1:03:24.368 --> 1:03:25.967
Zee, come.

1:03:25.969 --> 1:03:28.937
<i>[Ryan] I just wish while we're doing
all this, working out what we need,</i>

1:03:28.939 --> 1:03:31.173
<i>I didn't have to deal with
this stuff from my mom,</i>

1:03:31.175 --> 1:03:32.307
<i>which is making it
even harder for me.</i>

1:03:32.309 --> 1:03:33.942
<i>But I'm not gonna
let that discourage me</i>

1:03:33.944 --> 1:03:35.177
<i>or slow me down.</i>

1:03:39.282 --> 1:03:40.782
<i>I'm gonna keep working hard.</i>

1:03:40.784 --> 1:03:42.951
<i>And do what I have to do,
to make it to my goals</i>

1:03:42.953 --> 1:03:44.519
<i>and get to where I need.</i>

1:03:44.521 --> 1:03:47.122
<i>Because I'm dedicated to this
process, and doing whatever it takes,</i>

1:03:47.124 --> 1:03:49.224
<i>to lose the weight
and have a better life.</i>

1:03:49.592 --> 1:03:51.326
<i>No matter how hard it gets.</i>

1:04:04.874 --> 1:04:08.043
<i>I feel like the past months have
been really productive for me.</i>

1:04:08.045 --> 1:04:09.477
<i>Because I'm doing
well with my diet,</i>

1:04:09.479 --> 1:04:11.379
<i>and started
exercising a lot more.</i>

1:04:12.782 --> 1:04:14.983
<i>It's still a little too cold
outside to risk walking,</i>

1:04:14.985 --> 1:04:16.852
<i>so my mom and I
came up with the idea</i>

1:04:16.854 --> 1:04:17.853
<i>of doing chores
around the house,</i>

1:04:17.855 --> 1:04:21.489
<i>to get a lot of activity
I need, in.</i>

1:04:21.491 --> 1:04:23.892
<i>So, I'm getting up everyday
to do that and help out</i>

1:04:23.894 --> 1:04:26.494
<i>Mostly with stuff
like the laundry.</i>

1:04:26.496 --> 1:04:28.763
<i>I'm doing some sweeping
and vacuuming too.</i>

1:04:28.765 --> 1:04:29.998
<i>But that still takes
a lot out of me.</i>

1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:31.633
<i>So, helping with the laundry,</i>

1:04:31.635 --> 1:04:33.668
<i>is what I like to focus on
for my exercising.</i>

1:04:33.670 --> 1:04:36.705
<i>Because I can do some of it
sitting down and rest when I need to.</i>

1:04:36.707 --> 1:04:39.074
<i>Make sure I don't push
myself too hard.</i>

1:04:39.076 --> 1:04:42.110
<i>But I can already feel my stamina
and energy levels getting better,</i>

1:04:42.112 --> 1:04:43.812
<i>just from doing this
the past month.</i>

1:04:43.814 --> 1:04:46.481
<i>So, I'm feeling really good.</i>

1:04:46.483 --> 1:04:48.250
<i>And I feeling like I'm
getting a lot stronger too.</i>

1:04:48.252 --> 1:04:51.386
<i>Because I'm doing my upper
body exercising everyday, as well.</i>

1:04:57.193 --> 1:04:58.760
<i>I was really sore at first,</i>

1:04:58.762 --> 1:05:01.296
<i>but now doing all of this
doesn't even faze me.</i>

1:05:01.298 --> 1:05:03.865
<i>And I'm feeling muscle in my
arms I didn't even know I had.</i>

1:05:03.867 --> 1:05:05.667
<i>So, I know
I'm building muscle mass</i>

1:05:05.669 --> 1:05:07.035
<i>and improving my body like that.</i>

1:05:07.037 --> 1:05:08.770
<i>And I'm excited to keep doing it</i>

1:05:08.772 --> 1:05:10.105
<i>and getting even stronger.</i>

1:05:10.107 --> 1:05:12.240
<i>I'm even thinking
about joining a gym.</i>

1:05:15.544 --> 1:05:17.112
<i>I'm also sticking to my diet</i>

1:05:17.114 --> 1:05:19.047
<i>and doing it my mom's way,
with no cheat days.</i>

1:05:19.049 --> 1:05:20.782
<i>And I know I'm losing
a lot more weight</i>

1:05:20.784 --> 1:05:22.751
<i>because I can feel it
in my knees when I walk.</i>

1:05:22.753 --> 1:05:24.719
<i>So I should be on track
to hit my next goal</i>

1:05:24.721 --> 1:05:27.088
<i>by the time I go back
to see Dr. Now again.</i>

1:05:27.090 --> 1:05:29.457
<i>So, overall, I'm feeling
really good about this.</i>

1:05:30.559 --> 1:05:32.727
<i>The plan is to move down
to Houston next month,</i>

1:05:32.729 --> 1:05:34.162
<i>in time for my next
appointment with him.</i>

1:05:34.164 --> 1:05:35.830
<i>So that means we need to pack up</i>

1:05:35.832 --> 1:05:37.465
<i>and head there
in the next few weeks.</i>

1:05:38.167 --> 1:05:39.801
<i>Unfortunately, I didn't find</i>

1:05:39.803 --> 1:05:41.970
<i>a better apartment,
like I was hoping.</i>

1:05:41.972 --> 1:05:43.505
<i>So we're just moving
on the best option</i>

1:05:43.507 --> 1:05:44.773
<i>from what I have to pick from.</i>

1:05:44.775 --> 1:05:46.341
<i>And hope that it works out
like need.</i>

1:05:47.076 --> 1:05:48.710
<i>So everything
is coming together,</i>

1:05:48.712 --> 1:05:50.178
<i>and I'm making big strides,</i>

1:05:50.180 --> 1:05:52.314
<i>and I'm excited
to be doing this.</i>

1:05:52.316 --> 1:05:54.950
<i>I'm moving to Houston
to get the help I need.</i>

1:06:01.824 --> 1:06:04.359
[music playing]

1:06:12.969 --> 1:06:16.905
<i>[Ryan] My family and I need to move
down to Houston in the next week,</i>

1:06:16.907 --> 1:06:20.108
<i>if I'm gonna get there in time for
my next appointment with Dr. Now.</i>

1:06:20.110 --> 1:06:23.511
<i>It's in about nine days from
now and I don't wanna miss it,</i>

1:06:23.513 --> 1:06:25.246
<i>because I've been
working really hard,</i>

1:06:25.248 --> 1:06:27.682
<i>and I wanna show
Dr. Now how well I'm doing.</i>

1:06:27.684 --> 1:06:29.250
<i>But my mom and Leroy are saying</i>

1:06:29.252 --> 1:06:30.752
<i>they need more time
to get things ready.</i>

1:06:30.754 --> 1:06:32.787
<i>And so I've been
frustrated with them,</i>

1:06:32.789 --> 1:06:35.123
<i>because they knew I had
this appointment coming up.</i>

1:06:35.125 --> 1:06:36.791
<i>So, I told them,
one way or another,</i>

1:06:36.793 --> 1:06:37.959
<i>I'm getting down there.</i>

1:06:37.961 --> 1:06:39.861
<i>And I asked Leroy
to get me some boxes</i>

1:06:39.863 --> 1:06:41.830
<i>so I can start
packing up my stuff,</i>

1:06:41.832 --> 1:06:43.765
<i>because come hell or high water</i>

1:06:43.767 --> 1:06:46.167
<i>I'm gonna find a way
to get to Houston.</i>

1:06:46.169 --> 1:06:48.336
<i>With or without them,
if I have to.</i>

1:06:49.071 --> 1:06:50.572
<i>I moved to Montana on my own,</i>

1:06:50.574 --> 1:06:52.240
<i>so I can move to Texas
on my own.</i>

1:06:53.109 --> 1:06:55.877
<i>Especially with how much
progress I'm making.</i>

1:06:55.879 --> 1:06:58.680
<i>I'm getting healthier
and stronger everyday,</i>

1:06:58.682 --> 1:07:01.249
<i>and I'm rising
to the challenges I need.</i>

1:07:01.251 --> 1:07:03.818
<i>So if this is just one more
obstacle I have to overcome,</i>

1:07:03.820 --> 1:07:05.320
<i>then I will.</i>

1:07:08.457 --> 1:07:10.492
<i>But right now,
everything is up in the air.</i>

1:07:10.494 --> 1:07:13.061
<i>I'm pushing my mom and Leroy
to figure everything out,</i>

1:07:13.063 --> 1:07:14.929
<i>and take this more seriously</i>

1:07:14.931 --> 1:07:18.199
<i>because my whole life
is depending on this.</i>

1:07:18.201 --> 1:07:20.201
<i>And they know how
important this is to me,</i>

1:07:21.070 --> 1:07:23.204
<i>and how much I'm sacrificing.</i>

1:07:24.240 --> 1:07:26.408
<i>You know, my friend in Oregon,
who is sick,</i>

1:07:27.543 --> 1:07:29.744
<i>he's getting worse,</i>

1:07:29.746 --> 1:07:32.380
<i>and I've been ignoring them
to keep losing weight...</i>

1:07:33.516 --> 1:07:36.017
<i>And it's made me feel
like a horrible friend.</i>

1:07:36.919 --> 1:07:39.054
<i>That's how committed
I am to doing this,</i>

1:07:39.422 --> 1:07:40.989
<i>and getting life right.</i>

1:07:40.991 --> 1:07:44.292
<i>So if my mom and Leroy don't
come through like I need them to,</i>

1:07:45.061 --> 1:07:47.195
<i>then I plan to just
figure it out on my own</i>

1:07:47.197 --> 1:07:49.531
<i>because I'm ready to
do whatever it takes,</i>

1:07:49.533 --> 1:07:52.067
<i>to keep going
and do Dr. Now's program,</i>

1:07:52.134 --> 1:07:54.202
<i>with or without them.</i>

1:07:55.204 --> 1:07:58.173
<i>And I've already started
with back up options.</i>

1:07:58.175 --> 1:08:01.176
<i>I started calling friends to
come pick me up and take me.</i>

1:08:01.510 --> 1:08:02.944
<i>And I have someone that says</i>

1:08:02.946 --> 1:08:05.747
<i>that they'll drive me to
Houston if it comes down to that.</i>

1:08:05.749 --> 1:08:07.382
<i>So at least, I have a driver.</i>

1:08:10.052 --> 1:08:11.753
<i>I'll figure out
where I'm staying</i>

1:08:11.755 --> 1:08:13.955
<i>and everything else too
if I have to.</i>

1:08:16.025 --> 1:08:18.059
<i>I've come too far
and worked too hard</i>

1:08:18.061 --> 1:08:20.695
<i>to let things start to
get missed up now.</i>

1:08:20.697 --> 1:08:23.965
<i>So I don't know exactly
what I'm gonna do,</i>

1:08:23.967 --> 1:08:25.500
<i>or how I'm gonna
figure it all out.</i>

1:08:28.971 --> 1:08:32.807
<i>But what I do know is that I
will, no matter what it takes.</i>

1:08:32.809 --> 1:08:35.343
<i>Because I'm not missing my
next appointment and risking</i>

1:08:35.345 --> 1:08:37.345
<i>my only chance
to get my life back.</i>

1:08:38.647 --> 1:08:39.547
[sighs]

1:08:52.895 --> 1:08:54.496
[Dr. Now]
<i>Since my last call with Ryan</i>

1:08:54.498 --> 1:08:55.663
<i>a few months ago</i>

1:08:55.665 --> 1:08:57.866
he seemed to have fallen
off the map.

1:08:57.868 --> 1:08:59.734
<i>We set an appointment with him,</i>

1:08:59.736 --> 1:09:01.903
<i>here in Houston,
to see where his weight is,</i>

1:09:01.905 --> 1:09:05.006
<i>and if he is actually
losing like he said,</i>

1:09:05.008 --> 1:09:07.041
<i>but that was supposed to be
a month ago,</i>

1:09:07.043 --> 1:09:08.877
<i>and he never showed up.</i>

1:09:08.879 --> 1:09:10.979
And he hasn't been
answering my calls.

1:09:10.981 --> 1:09:13.214
<i>But my office finally
got hold of him</i>

1:09:13.216 --> 1:09:15.416
and set up a call
with him today.

1:09:15.418 --> 1:09:17.519
<i>So we'll see what he has to say</i>

1:09:17.521 --> 1:09:21.089
<i>because he has said he
was moving here to Houston</i>

1:09:21.091 --> 1:09:22.924
but that doesn't seem
to have happened

1:09:22.926 --> 1:09:25.660
<i>and we have to know
what's going on with him</i>

1:09:25.662 --> 1:09:29.130
<i>but so far it doesn't really
seem like he's very committed</i>

1:09:29.132 --> 1:09:31.232
<i>to doing what he needs
to get healthy</i>

1:09:31.234 --> 1:09:32.467
and save his life.

1:09:33.135 --> 1:09:33.968
[Skype ringing]

1:09:33.970 --> 1:09:34.903
[grunts]

1:09:34.905 --> 1:09:37.772
It looks like he's not answering

1:09:37.774 --> 1:09:40.241
and he's not
showing up on video.

1:09:40.243 --> 1:09:42.810
For past two months
every time we call him,

1:09:42.812 --> 1:09:44.946
he doesn't answer his call...

1:09:44.948 --> 1:09:49.150
And seems like he's not
serious about saving his life.

1:09:49.152 --> 1:09:54.789
So I'm not sure
where we go with Ryan.

1:09:54.791 --> 1:09:57.392
So I'm going to call him
on cell phone and see.

1:10:00.229 --> 1:10:02.530
[line ringing]

1:10:04.967 --> 1:10:06.201
Hello.

1:10:06.802 --> 1:10:09.003
<i>- [Ryan] Hello.
- Ryan?</i>

1:10:09.672 --> 1:10:11.072
<i>Yeah, Dr. Now,
how are you?</i>

1:10:11.074 --> 1:10:13.975
I'm doing okay.
How have you been?

1:10:14.810 --> 1:10:16.778
<i>All I'm doing,
right now I'm dealing</i>

1:10:16.780 --> 1:10:18.513
<i>with some family stuff
here in Oregon.</i>

1:10:18.515 --> 1:10:22.116
<i>Um, but-- We're dealing.</i>

1:10:22.518 --> 1:10:23.718
<i>What's going on?</i>

1:10:23.720 --> 1:10:27.255
Well, you haven't been
answering your calls

1:10:27.257 --> 1:10:31.025
so we haven't been
able to get in touch with you

1:10:31.027 --> 1:10:32.961
and see what's going on.

1:10:33.596 --> 1:10:36.064
<i>Yeah. This is the first time
I've seen you call</i>

1:10:36.066 --> 1:10:39.200
<i>'cause I have you
on my phone under Dr. Now so.</i>

1:10:39.202 --> 1:10:41.903
<i>I don't have any
missed calls from you.</i>

1:10:41.905 --> 1:10:45.440
Well, you missed a lot of
calls from me and my office.

1:10:45.442 --> 1:10:47.108
And so what's going on whit you?

1:10:47.110 --> 1:10:51.446
You were talking about coming
down to Houston a few months ago,

1:10:51.448 --> 1:10:54.082
but you missed the appointment
we had for you, last month

1:10:54.084 --> 1:10:55.950
and we haven't heard from you.

1:10:55.952 --> 1:10:58.920
What-- What happened with that?

1:10:58.922 --> 1:11:02.957
<i>Uh, I didn't-- My driver--
I ended up with another driver</i>

1:11:02.959 --> 1:11:04.492
<i>I got all taken care of now.</i>

1:11:05.027 --> 1:11:07.528
<i>Uh, I do have a driver now.</i>

1:11:07.530 --> 1:11:11.966
Okay. Uh, so are you
doing your diet?

1:11:11.968 --> 1:11:14.836
<i>Yeah. You know, I've got
a gym membership at home.</i>

1:11:14.838 --> 1:11:18.172
Gym is good but it's not
affecting your weight,

1:11:18.174 --> 1:11:20.675
your weight has to do
with your eating habits.

1:11:20.677 --> 1:11:23.511
Are you watching your diet?

1:11:23.513 --> 1:11:25.880
<i>Yep, I've been doing chicken
breast and, like, veggies.</i>

1:11:25.882 --> 1:11:30.818
<i>Um, it's almost too much
but I've stayed with it</i>

1:11:30.820 --> 1:11:35.056
<i>I-- I honestly follow
95% of the time.</i>

1:11:35.058 --> 1:11:36.491
<i>I follow my diet.</i>

1:11:37.826 --> 1:11:40.161
You feel like
you've lost any weight?

1:11:40.163 --> 1:11:42.030
<i>Oh, in my knees for sure.</i>

1:11:42.064 --> 1:11:43.197
<i>Absolutely.</i>

1:11:43.199 --> 1:11:45.633
So how much you think you lost?

1:11:45.635 --> 1:11:46.734
<i>Um, I don't know.</i>

1:11:46.736 --> 1:11:50.672
<i>I feel easily
40-50 pounds minimum.</i>

1:11:50.674 --> 1:11:54.842
On top of the weight you think
you lost already or total?

1:11:54.844 --> 1:11:55.877
<i>On top of how much I'd lost.</i>

1:11:55.944 --> 1:11:57.712
Okay.

1:11:57.714 --> 1:12:00.848
So when do you think
you're coming down to Houston?

1:12:00.850 --> 1:12:03.685
<i>So, ASAP if all goes well</i>

1:12:03.687 --> 1:12:08.523
<i>So hopefully by the beg--
End of this coming week</i>

1:12:08.525 --> 1:12:09.824
<i>or beginning
of the following week</i>

1:12:09.826 --> 1:12:11.859
<i>will be the worst case scenario</i>

1:12:11.861 --> 1:12:14.862
Okay. We'll set an
appointment for you to be here

1:12:14.864 --> 1:12:16.030
at the end of next week

1:12:16.032 --> 1:12:17.999
to give you time to come here,

1:12:18.001 --> 1:12:20.001
but before you do,
it's been do long

1:12:20.003 --> 1:12:21.703
since we had the tests done

1:12:21.705 --> 1:12:25.840
that we need to make
appointment at the clinic over there

1:12:25.842 --> 1:12:29.110
and get you over there
and check your weight and see

1:12:29.112 --> 1:12:30.645
what you progress is,

1:12:30.647 --> 1:12:32.113
and run some tests on you again

1:12:32.115 --> 1:12:34.749
to make sure there are
no issues with your health

1:12:34.751 --> 1:12:37.985
that will make it
unsafe for you to travel.

1:12:37.987 --> 1:12:40.788
<i>- Okay.
- But you need to stop giving me excuses</i>

1:12:40.790 --> 1:12:43.858
because saving your life
is more important

1:12:43.860 --> 1:12:47.128
than any other event
in your life.

1:12:47.130 --> 1:12:51.733
So this is something that
you need to be proactive for it.

1:12:51.800 --> 1:12:53.267
- And--
<i>- Mm-hm.</i>

1:12:53.802 --> 1:12:57.805
And it's not something that you
should play around and waste time on it

1:12:57.807 --> 1:13:00.108
because you don't
have much time.

1:13:00.110 --> 1:13:02.510
The way your body is built up

1:13:02.512 --> 1:13:03.711
and your weight and all,

1:13:03.713 --> 1:13:06.681
the strain you have
on your system.

1:13:06.683 --> 1:13:12.620
So the priority should be saving
your life and try to lose weight.

1:13:12.622 --> 1:13:16.691
And all these delays
that you're making...

1:13:16.693 --> 1:13:18.960
At some point, you're
going to run out of time

1:13:18.962 --> 1:13:21.162
if you don't take care
of yourself.

1:13:21.164 --> 1:13:24.632
So that's important
thing for you...

1:13:24.634 --> 1:13:27.135
priority should be
to saving your life

1:13:27.137 --> 1:13:31.606
and try to lose weight
and take care of yourself.

1:13:31.608 --> 1:13:35.042
And-- But you making
all these other priorities

1:13:35.044 --> 1:13:37.779
and you're putting
everything back on hold

1:13:37.781 --> 1:13:41.749
and that doesn't seem that
you're taking things seriously.

1:13:41.751 --> 1:13:43.718
<i>Oh, I'm-- I mean,
I'm taking it seriously</i>

1:13:43.720 --> 1:13:45.753
<i>it's just I did not
have a driver the first time</i>

1:13:45.755 --> 1:13:48.089
<i>so I'm taking
it serious, I mean...</i>

1:13:48.091 --> 1:13:49.957
<i>I'm coming there a 100%.</i>

1:13:49.959 --> 1:13:51.826
<i>It's just a couple of things
came up</i>

1:13:51.828 --> 1:13:53.828
<i>and I had to get those</i>

1:13:53.830 --> 1:13:55.863
<i>ducks on a row, so to speak,</i>

1:13:55.865 --> 1:13:58.065
<i>in order to even be able
to come there at all.</i>

1:13:58.534 --> 1:14:00.168
<i>- So...
- All right.</i>

1:14:00.836 --> 1:14:03.037
And you're doing your exercises?

1:14:03.405 --> 1:14:04.472
<i>Yeah. [clears throat]</i>

1:14:04.773 --> 1:14:06.407
Okay.

1:14:06.409 --> 1:14:09.944
So after they get your
current weight at the clinic.

1:14:09.946 --> 1:14:13.948
I want you to give me a call on
video and see how you look like.

1:14:14.149 --> 1:14:15.082
<i>Okay.</i>

1:14:15.084 --> 1:14:17.785
So we'll set that
appointment for you

1:14:17.787 --> 1:14:19.520
and then if everything
looks good

1:14:19.522 --> 1:14:21.289
with your weight and the tests

1:14:21.291 --> 1:14:24.759
I'll see you here in Houston
at the end of next week.

1:14:24.761 --> 1:14:25.927
<i>That sounds great.</i>

1:14:25.929 --> 1:14:27.962
All right. Talk to you later.

1:14:27.964 --> 1:14:29.831
<i>- All right, Bye bye.
- Bye bye.</i>

1:14:29.833 --> 1:14:31.165
[mellow music playing]

1:14:35.103 --> 1:14:36.771
[sighs]

1:14:36.773 --> 1:14:39.841
It looks like Ryan keeps
making excuses

1:14:39.843 --> 1:14:45.046
so I'm not sure where we
go with that, with Ryan.

1:14:46.982 --> 1:14:49.584
I think Ryan is intentionally

1:14:49.586 --> 1:14:52.153
avoiding video call with me.

1:14:52.155 --> 1:14:54.789
<i>So he either has not made
any more progress</i>

1:14:54.791 --> 1:14:56.190
<i>or put on some weight,</i>

1:14:56.192 --> 1:15:00.061
<i>because my guess is it's
likely he's still in the 700s</i>

1:15:00.063 --> 1:15:01.829
but hopefully
that's not the case

1:15:01.831 --> 1:15:03.698
and he's making progress

1:15:03.700 --> 1:15:06.033
<i>and hopefully Ryan
is telling me the truth</i>

1:15:06.035 --> 1:15:08.002
when he said
he's ready to do this.

1:15:08.004 --> 1:15:09.537
<i>But I am skeptical.</i>

1:15:09.539 --> 1:15:11.606
<i>We'll see where his weight is at</i>

1:15:11.608 --> 1:15:14.742
<i>and once we learn that,
that will tell me a lot.</i>

1:15:14.744 --> 1:15:17.912
Because, if the scale still
cannot read his weight,

1:15:17.914 --> 1:15:19.981
then he can't continue
with the argument

1:15:19.983 --> 1:15:21.949
that it is still malfunctioning.

1:15:21.951 --> 1:15:25.920
<i>But if he is still over
the weight limit of the scale,</i>

1:15:25.922 --> 1:15:28.089
then we will have to run
the test on him again.

1:15:28.091 --> 1:15:30.925
<i>Because he could be gaining,
and if that's the case,</i>

1:15:30.927 --> 1:15:34.729
then not only will I have
concern about him travelling

1:15:34.731 --> 1:15:38.232
<i>thousands of miles with all
that strain on his body,</i>

1:15:38.234 --> 1:15:39.867
but it will show me
he is not really

1:15:39.869 --> 1:15:43.838
taking his situation seriously
and he's playing games.

1:15:43.840 --> 1:15:48.543
And if that's the case, then there is
no point for him to come down here

1:15:48.545 --> 1:15:52.513
and put his body through all
that just to waste everyone's time.

1:15:52.515 --> 1:15:56.984
Because we're not moving ahead
with him until he proves to me

1:15:56.986 --> 1:16:00.221
he's ready to do what he needs
to succeed at this.

1:16:05.928 --> 1:16:07.428
[slow song fading]

1:16:14.136 --> 1:16:16.304
<i>Lately, it's been a really
hard time for me.</i>

1:16:17.406 --> 1:16:18.406
<i>I've been struggling a lot</i>

1:16:18.408 --> 1:16:21.375
<i>and that started about
a month and a half ago,</i>

1:16:21.377 --> 1:16:23.010
<i>when a lot of bad things
happened to me.</i>

1:16:23.012 --> 1:16:26.147
<i>First, my mom and Leroy decided
they weren't coming with me to Houston.</i>

1:16:26.149 --> 1:16:28.482
<i>And that they weren't
gonna move with me after all.</i>

1:16:28.484 --> 1:16:30.051
<i>Which hit me hard.</i>

1:16:30.053 --> 1:16:33.120
<i>'Cause I thought I had their
support and they'd be there for me.</i>

1:16:33.922 --> 1:16:35.423
Do you need anything else?

1:16:35.425 --> 1:16:37.858
- No, I'm good.
- You good? You sure?

1:16:37.860 --> 1:16:38.759
Yep.

1:16:38.761 --> 1:16:40.528
<i>I was wrong about that though.</i>

1:16:40.530 --> 1:16:42.930
<i>And that's been very hard
for me to accept.</i>

1:16:42.932 --> 1:16:44.231
Keep going.

1:16:44.233 --> 1:16:46.067
<i>[Ryan] Because I've been
really frustrated at them</i>

1:16:46.069 --> 1:16:47.034
<i>for doing that to me</i>

1:16:47.036 --> 1:16:49.503
<i>and making me feel
completely abandoned.</i>

1:16:50.639 --> 1:16:52.006
<i>But I wasn't gonna
let that stop me</i>

1:16:52.008 --> 1:16:54.141
<i>from getting help,
so I called some friends</i>

1:16:54.143 --> 1:16:56.043
<i>to see if someone
can take me to Houston</i>

1:16:56.045 --> 1:16:57.511
<i>and help get me there.</i>

1:16:57.513 --> 1:16:58.646
<i>And someone said they would.</i>

1:16:58.648 --> 1:17:00.815
<i>And the day before we were
gonna leave,</i>

1:17:00.817 --> 1:17:04.285
<i>he called and told me he had
to back out and couldn't do it.</i>

1:17:06.021 --> 1:17:08.489
<i>So, I was just left with
just no options at all.</i>

1:17:09.091 --> 1:17:11.759
<i>But I didn't give up even then.</i>

1:17:11.761 --> 1:17:13.461
<i>I kept calling around
to find someone</i>

1:17:13.463 --> 1:17:15.830
<i>who could take me,
but no one could.</i>

1:17:15.832 --> 1:17:18.833
<i>There was absolutely no one
I could go to in my life</i>

1:17:18.835 --> 1:17:20.968
<i>for any type of support.</i>

1:17:21.670 --> 1:17:24.005
<i>So, I'm completely alone
and on my own.</i>

1:17:24.007 --> 1:17:27.174
<i>And that alone was depressing.</i>

1:17:27.176 --> 1:17:29.343
<i>So I know I'd
shut down for a bit.</i>

1:17:30.145 --> 1:17:32.413
[line ringing]

1:17:34.983 --> 1:17:37.084
<i>[man] Hello.
How can I help you today?</i>

1:17:37.086 --> 1:17:40.554
Hi, I'd like to place an order
for delivery, please?

1:17:40.556 --> 1:17:42.890
<i>[man] All right, go ahead,
whatever you like.</i>

1:17:42.892 --> 1:17:46.060
Can I please get two Philly
steak and cheese sandwiches,

1:17:46.062 --> 1:17:47.795
an eight-piece order of wings,

1:17:47.797 --> 1:17:50.731
and a large cheese
curd with ranch?

1:17:50.733 --> 1:17:53.467
<i>- [man] What else can I get for you?
- Uh, that's it.</i>

1:17:53.469 --> 1:17:57.471
<i>Um, give us about 40 minutes
and we'll have that right on at ya.</i>

1:17:57.473 --> 1:18:00.274
- All right, thank you so much.
<i>- [man] I'll see you shortly.</i>

1:18:01.576 --> 1:18:03.944
<i>[Ryan] On top of losing my
mom and Leroy's support and help,</i>

1:18:03.946 --> 1:18:07.081
<i>recently, things got
even worse for me</i>

1:18:07.083 --> 1:18:09.950
<i>when I found out about my
friend back in Oregon who is sick,</i>

1:18:09.952 --> 1:18:12.186
<i>is practically gone
at this point.</i>

1:18:13.522 --> 1:18:16.323
<i>Their health is so bad
that they don't have long...</i>

1:18:16.325 --> 1:18:17.991
[clears throat]

1:18:17.993 --> 1:18:20.961
<i>and when I found that out, it
made me feel like such a horrible friend</i>

1:18:20.963 --> 1:18:23.998
<i>because I sacrificed
being there for them.</i>

1:18:24.000 --> 1:18:24.732
<i>To try and focus on me.</i>

1:18:24.734 --> 1:18:26.400
[knocking on door]

1:18:28.737 --> 1:18:32.473
<i>And it's hard not to feel like that
was not only completely selfish of me</i>

1:18:32.475 --> 1:18:34.809
<i>but that choice might
have stolen my last chance</i>

1:18:34.811 --> 1:18:37.812
<i>to be there for them
and see them.</i>

1:18:37.814 --> 1:18:41.082
<i>And that depressed me even more.</i>

1:18:41.084 --> 1:18:44.251
-[delivery man] Here it is.
-[Ryan] Thank you. Have a good one.

1:18:45.787 --> 1:18:46.887
[clears throat]

1:18:46.889 --> 1:18:49.790
<i>So, life has just been
a struggle for me lately.</i>

1:18:49.792 --> 1:18:52.126
<i>To where it feels like there's
just no one in my corner.</i>

1:18:52.128 --> 1:18:53.627
<i>And no matter what I do,</i>

1:18:53.629 --> 1:18:55.362
<i>I just can't get ahead.</i>

1:18:57.699 --> 1:19:00.101
<i>But despite all this
and all the setbacks,</i>

1:19:00.103 --> 1:19:02.703
<i>I haven't let that stop me
from doing what I need.</i>

1:19:02.705 --> 1:19:04.004
<i>I've still been
sticking to the diet</i>

1:19:04.006 --> 1:19:06.707
<i>and working hard
at my exercises.</i>

1:19:06.709 --> 1:19:09.276
<i>But the reason I've been
able to stick to it like I need</i>

1:19:09.278 --> 1:19:11.045
<i>is that I'm having
some cheat meals.</i>

1:19:11.047 --> 1:19:12.513
<i>Not whole cheat days,</i>

1:19:12.515 --> 1:19:13.681
<i>just a meal
once or twice a week.</i>

1:19:13.683 --> 1:19:15.249
That looks good.

1:19:15.251 --> 1:19:18.452
<i>Well, everything I eat doesn't
have to be something from the diet.</i>

1:19:19.755 --> 1:19:21.856
<i>I usually wait until
my mom and Leroy go out</i>

1:19:21.858 --> 1:19:24.125
<i>so I don't have them in my face.</i>

1:19:25.193 --> 1:19:26.660
<i>I don't know what my weight is,</i>

1:19:26.662 --> 1:19:29.130
<i>but I know it's a lot less
than it was.</i>

1:19:29.132 --> 1:19:31.932
<i>And probably in the 500s
at this point.</i>

1:19:31.934 --> 1:19:32.833
Perfect.

1:19:32.835 --> 1:19:34.034
<i>But I haven't been able</i>

1:19:34.036 --> 1:19:36.504
<i>to go back and get
my weight checked yet.</i>

1:19:38.106 --> 1:19:39.807
<i>I talked to Dr. Now
couple of weeks ago</i>

1:19:39.809 --> 1:19:43.511
<i>and he wanted me to go
back to the local clinic.</i>

1:19:43.513 --> 1:19:46.213
<i>But then right after
is when I found out</i>

1:19:46.215 --> 1:19:47.982
<i>what was going on
with my friend in Oregon</i>

1:19:47.984 --> 1:19:51.385
<i>and how bad off they were,
and I had to postpone</i>

1:19:52.888 --> 1:19:54.421
<i>just because
it wasn't a good time,</i>

1:19:54.423 --> 1:19:56.090
and I was too depressed.

1:19:58.794 --> 1:20:01.428
<i>And that also delayed
me going to Houston.</i>

1:20:02.531 --> 1:20:04.665
<i>But my plan is to
reach out to Dr. Now again</i>

1:20:04.667 --> 1:20:06.000
<i>here in a few weeks</i>

1:20:06.002 --> 1:20:08.335
<i>and get him to reschedule
the appointment here</i>

1:20:08.337 --> 1:20:10.004
<i>he wants me to have.</i>

1:20:10.205 --> 1:20:11.672
[clears throat]

1:20:11.674 --> 1:20:12.973
<i>And so, I can go
show him how I'm doing</i>

1:20:12.975 --> 1:20:14.942
<i>and so, I can
keep moving forward</i>

1:20:14.944 --> 1:20:17.444
<i>because I'm still just
as committed to doing this</i>

1:20:17.446 --> 1:20:19.814
<i>and getting healthy as I was
as when I started.</i>

1:20:19.816 --> 1:20:23.150
<i>It's just, life's been
throwing me some curve balls</i>

1:20:23.152 --> 1:20:26.253
<i>and I'm trying to figure it
all out as fast as I can.</i>

1:20:28.824 --> 1:20:31.258
<i>It's not ideal, but it's life.</i>

1:20:31.260 --> 1:20:32.860
<i>I can't control
when bad things happen.</i>

1:20:32.862 --> 1:20:35.229
<i>And it feels like
once there's one thing,</i>

1:20:35.231 --> 1:20:39.099
a ton of other issues and
problems are right behind it.

1:20:39.801 --> 1:20:40.634
[clears throat]

1:20:40.636 --> 1:20:41.702
<i>Not only have I had</i>

1:20:41.704 --> 1:20:44.605
<i>all the setbacks of moving in
with my friend,</i>

1:20:44.607 --> 1:20:47.074
<i>but because of the delay
in moving to Houston,</i>

1:20:47.076 --> 1:20:49.009
<i>I even lost the
apartment option I had.</i>

1:20:49.011 --> 1:20:49.910
[clears throat]

1:20:49.912 --> 1:20:51.812
<i>So, I have to figure that again</i>

1:20:51.814 --> 1:20:55.015
<i>and figure out how to move
down to Houston on my own.</i>

1:20:55.017 --> 1:20:58.085
<i>So, there's a lot that's
on me to figure out.</i>

1:20:58.087 --> 1:20:59.553
That was good.

1:21:04.893 --> 1:21:06.961
This is hard.

1:21:11.066 --> 1:21:16.003
<i>Some days, I'm so close
to quitting, it's ridiculous.</i>

1:21:18.273 --> 1:21:21.742
<i>But mama didn't raise
no quitter, so I can't.</i>

1:21:21.744 --> 1:21:23.110
<i>Just gonna keep going,</i>

1:21:23.112 --> 1:21:24.445
<i>gonna prove that I can do this.</i>

1:21:29.150 --> 1:21:30.484
[sighs]

1:22:27.309 --> 1:22:28.409
[chiming from laptop]

1:22:34.516 --> 1:22:35.983
Oh.

1:22:37.519 --> 1:22:41.288
Ryan had an appointment
and he's not showing up.

1:22:46.194 --> 1:22:48.162
I'm gonna call him on the phone.

1:22:49.064 --> 1:22:50.397
[number pad beeping]

1:22:58.506 --> 1:22:59.506
[line ringing]

1:23:06.348 --> 1:23:07.948
<i>Over the past few months,</i>

1:23:07.950 --> 1:23:10.117
<i>I have made
a number of appointments</i>

1:23:10.119 --> 1:23:11.986
<i>to make video calls with Ryan</i>

1:23:11.988 --> 1:23:14.221
<i>and he has missed all of them.</i>

1:23:14.889 --> 1:23:16.290
[continues ringing]

1:23:18.793 --> 1:23:21.161
I guess he's not
picking up the phone.

1:23:22.998 --> 1:23:26.834
<i>And it looks like he is
doing that again today.</i>

1:23:26.836 --> 1:23:28.836
<i>I had a call with him right now</i>

1:23:28.838 --> 1:23:30.404
and he's not picking up again.

1:23:30.972 --> 1:23:32.006
<i>So, it looks like</i>

1:23:32.008 --> 1:23:35.009
<i>he's been avoiding me
and playing games.</i>

1:23:35.011 --> 1:23:37.778
<i>In a few days,
after he misses each call,</i>

1:23:37.780 --> 1:23:40.647
<i>he sends me different excuses.</i>

1:23:40.649 --> 1:23:43.150
Once he said
he had moved to Oregon

1:23:43.152 --> 1:23:44.852
<i>to take care of a dying friend.</i>

1:23:44.854 --> 1:23:46.920
<i>And he's now living there</i>

1:23:46.922 --> 1:23:49.123
and has to prioritize
being a good friend

1:23:49.125 --> 1:23:51.291
<i>instead of doing the program.</i>

1:23:51.293 --> 1:23:52.926
<i>But I find it hard to believe</i>

1:23:52.928 --> 1:23:56.230
<i>at 700 lb. he is able
to take care of anyone.</i>

1:23:56.232 --> 1:23:59.233
Then he told me
he is still in Montana.

1:23:59.235 --> 1:24:00.834
<i>But that he is sick and dying</i>

1:24:00.836 --> 1:24:03.037
<i>and that he has a friend
of their family</i>

1:24:03.039 --> 1:24:05.773
<i>who is a doctor,
who is taking care of him</i>

1:24:05.775 --> 1:24:07.875
and he doesn't need
my help anymore.

1:24:07.877 --> 1:24:10.811
<i>But a couple weeks after that,
he sent me a message</i>

1:24:10.813 --> 1:24:12.746
<i>that he changed his mind</i>

1:24:12.748 --> 1:24:15.983
<i>and that he wants to come
to Houston and get my help.</i>

1:24:15.985 --> 1:24:17.184
<i>And then, this last month,</i>

1:24:17.186 --> 1:24:20.087
<i>he said he moved to Oregon again</i>

1:24:20.089 --> 1:24:22.723
<i>and he's helping his friend out.</i>

1:24:22.725 --> 1:24:24.158
But he won't talk to me

1:24:24.160 --> 1:24:26.994
any time I set a call with him.

1:24:26.996 --> 1:24:28.762
<i>Because if he doesn't pick up,</i>

1:24:28.764 --> 1:24:29.797
<i>so I think, at this point,</i>

1:24:29.799 --> 1:24:32.299
<i>Ryan has made his choice.</i>

1:24:32.301 --> 1:24:35.069
<i>He doesn't see the
urgency in his situation</i>

1:24:35.071 --> 1:24:37.104
<i>to do anything about his health</i>

1:24:37.106 --> 1:24:39.573
<i>and still thinks he
can continue to lie</i>

1:24:39.575 --> 1:24:41.775
<i>and manipulate
everybody around him</i>

1:24:41.777 --> 1:24:44.778
<i>to do whatever he wants,
whenever he wants.</i>

1:24:44.780 --> 1:24:48.749
So, at this point, there is
nothing more we can do for Ryan

1:24:48.751 --> 1:24:52.186
<i>and there is no point in
playing his game any longer.</i>

1:24:52.188 --> 1:24:55.022
<i>I think his motives
for reaching out to me</i>

1:24:55.024 --> 1:24:58.425
<i>were for other reasons
than to get the help he needs.</i>

1:24:58.427 --> 1:24:59.927
<i>Hopefully, he wakes up</i>

1:24:59.929 --> 1:25:02.996
<i>to start doing what he
needs before it's too late.</i>

1:25:02.998 --> 1:25:05.699
<i>And if he ever
decides to do that</i>

1:25:05.701 --> 1:25:08.035
<i>and actually starts
telling me the truth,</i>

1:25:08.037 --> 1:25:11.138
<i>and starts following through
with what he says,</i>

1:25:11.140 --> 1:25:14.608
<i>then I may consider him
at that point.</i>

1:25:14.610 --> 1:25:15.709
<i>But as of right now,</i>

1:25:15.711 --> 1:25:17.911
<i>we're not moving
forward with Ryan</i>

1:25:17.913 --> 1:25:21.381
because he has no intention
to comply with the program

1:25:21.383 --> 1:25:23.851
<i>and I'm not sure he ever did.</i>

1:25:23.853 --> 1:25:25.519
<i>So, I wish him the best</i>

1:25:25.521 --> 1:25:30.090
<i>and truly hope he can
turn his life around soon,</i>

1:25:30.092 --> 1:25:31.525
before it's too late for him.
