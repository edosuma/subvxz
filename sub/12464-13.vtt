tent our place.

we have bugs,

Oh, liv has an irrational
fear of bugs.

I read her the first

This happened.

06:19.179 --> 06:20.645
Turns out it wasn't
a ladybug.

06:20.647 --> 06:22.981
It was a jelly bean.

I'm going to stare
right into those

09:46.553 --> 09:48.353
Beautiful brown eyes
and say

09:48.355 --> 09:51.089
"diggie, s'up?"

09:55.494 --> 09:57.362
For my last day,
I'm gonna convince mom

09:57.364 --> 09:58.763
That I'm sick
so I can stay behind

09:58.765 --> 10:00.365
And say good-bye
to my childhood home.

10:02.234 --> 10:05.704
126.8.

10:05.706 --> 10:07.238
I'm lucky to be alive.

10:07.240 --> 10:08.473
( coughs )

10:10.876 --> 10:13.511
And that's why you never
floss in space.

10:14.580 --> 10:16.314
Think about it.

10:16.316 --> 10:18.850
( music playing
through phone )

10:24.223 --> 10:25.457
Rocketeers,

10:25.459 --> 10:27.325
Feast your eyes

10:27.327 --> 10:28.793
On my new rocket.

10:28.795 --> 10:32.497
The "artie is a wad-bag."

10:32.499 --> 10:33.832
( applause )

10:33.834 --> 10:35.634
You can't call
your rocket that.

10:35.636 --> 10:38.703
Well, I've made
a lot of rockets, artie.

10:38.705 --> 10:40.839
Could you say
the name out loud

10:40.841 --> 10:42.507
So I know which one
you're talking about?

10:42.509 --> 10:44.709
Nice try.

10:44.711 --> 10:46.645
But do you take me
for a fool?

10:46.647 --> 10:49.481
No. I take you
for a wad-bag.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.717
It's time we settle
who the rocket king is

10:52.719 --> 10:54.386
Once and for all.

10:54.388 --> 10:56.721
Speak forth your challenge!

10:56.723 --> 11:00.392
I'm speaking forth,
baby.

11:00.394 --> 11:02.694
The falcon 500

11:02.696 --> 11:04.496
Versus
"artie is a wad-bag"

11:04.498 --> 11:07.232
In a hallway
rocket chair race.

11:07.234 --> 11:10.301
I accept
your challenge.

11:10.303 --> 11:11.503
( squawks )

11:13.239 --> 11:14.305
Wait, when are
we doing this again?

11:14.307 --> 11:15.440
I'm a little
overscheduled today.

11:15.442 --> 11:16.841
Like 3:00?

11:16.843 --> 11:18.376
Does 3:30 work?

11:18.378 --> 11:19.444
3:30 by
the water fountain.

11:19.446 --> 11:22.213
- Or the one that works?
- The one that works, duh.

11:22.215 --> 11:23.548
- Well, I didn't know.
- Well, now you do.

11:23.550 --> 11:25.350
- Fine.  Challenge accepted.
- Great.

11:27.553 --> 11:29.721
Goodbye, old house.

11:29.723 --> 11:31.456
We just barely got
to know each other again

11:31.458 --> 11:33.625
And now
we're torn apart.

11:33.627 --> 11:35.326
Will you comfort me,
couch,

11:35.328 --> 11:37.295
Collector of
afternoon dreams

11:37.297 --> 11:38.496
And loose change?

11:40.566 --> 11:41.800
<i>( cellphone rings )</i>

11:43.703 --> 11:46.237
( groans )
facegabbing again, mom?

11:46.239 --> 11:47.505
( clears throat )

11:47.507 --> 11:50.542
Hey, pete.
It's care bear.

11:50.544 --> 11:53.244
I just saw you
walk down the hall.

11:53.246 --> 11:55.380
Those new jeans
are looking good.

11:55.382 --> 11:57.449
- ( grunts )
- ( phone beeps )

12:00.252 --> 12:02.554
And now I don't have to
pretend to be sick.

12:02.556 --> 12:04.723
( clears throat )

12:04.725 --> 12:08.326
Oh.  <i>Au revoir,</i>
<i>stained glass window.</i>

12:08.328 --> 12:09.928
You colored my world.
( chuckles )

12:09.930 --> 12:10.995
I remember when I was--

12:16.702 --> 12:18.369
Parker,
what are you doing?

12:18.371 --> 12:20.271
I'm filling in
my tunnels.

12:21.941 --> 12:24.442
Okay, perhaps I should have
been more specific.

12:24.444 --> 12:25.610
What?!

12:27.246 --> 12:28.646
I've been digging
an intricate

12:28.648 --> 12:30.315
Network of tunnels
around the house.

12:30.317 --> 12:32.383
At first, it was
an escape from the monotony

12:32.385 --> 12:33.451
Of everyday life,

12:33.453 --> 12:35.320
But then it became
an actual escape

12:35.322 --> 12:36.554
In case stuff got real.

12:39.391 --> 12:42.460
You've got a serious party
going on up there, don't you?

12:42.462 --> 12:44.596
Hey,
thanks to these tunnels,

12:44.598 --> 12:46.264
I can get from
my bedroom

12:46.266 --> 12:48.533
To the bathroom
in three steps.

12:48.535 --> 12:50.468
- Oh.
- Sometimes,

12:50.470 --> 12:51.970
Every second counts.

12:58.878 --> 13:00.612
I decided I should
write diggie a note,

13:00.614 --> 13:02.413
But I wanted
to do something memorable.

13:02.415 --> 13:04.115
<i>And he left his</i>
<i>basketball at my house,</i>

13:04.117 --> 13:05.917
<i>So I returned it</i>

13:05.919 --> 13:08.586
With the words
"I like you. - Maddie"

13:08.588 --> 13:11.055
Written on it.

13:11.057 --> 13:12.524
What?

13:12.526 --> 13:14.392
That's as sweet as
mad dog rooney gets.

13:15.327 --> 13:17.662
Whoo!  I gotta
shower, guys.

13:17.664 --> 13:19.063
I'm sweating like a pig.

13:19.065 --> 13:20.331
I'll see you later,
all right?

13:25.404 --> 13:28.773
Oh hey,
maddie returned my basketball.

13:28.775 --> 13:30.074
Okay.

13:30.076 --> 13:31.409
He's reading it.

13:34.079 --> 13:36.581
Oh man,
she got it all dirty.

13:36.583 --> 13:38.349
( clears throat )

13:40.553 --> 13:42.420
S'up, diggie.

13:42.422 --> 13:44.422
Oh, hey, rooney.

13:44.424 --> 13:46.391
So,

13:46.393 --> 13:48.059
I returned
your basketball.

13:48.061 --> 13:49.060
Did you see
what was on it?

13:49.062 --> 13:50.528
Oh, that?

13:50.530 --> 13:52.630
Who cares?

13:54.400 --> 13:55.400
What?

13:55.402 --> 13:56.534
Yeah, whatever.

13:56.536 --> 13:57.569
It's not
a big deal.

13:59.405 --> 14:00.471
Not a big deal?

14:01.640 --> 14:03.575
To me this was like
the biggest deal ever.

14:03.577 --> 14:05.643
Yeah,
you know what?

14:05.645 --> 14:07.579
This was a mistake.

14:10.082 --> 14:12.650
Wow.
What was that all about?

14:14.420 --> 14:15.587
Yeah, I'm talking
to myself in the hall.

14:15.589 --> 14:17.689
Baffling girl moment.
Move on.

14:27.132 --> 14:28.433
All right.

14:28.435 --> 14:30.068
Once around the hall.

14:30.070 --> 14:32.770
Winner is declared
now and forever

14:32.772 --> 14:34.405
The rocket king.

14:34.407 --> 14:35.640
Holla!

14:37.476 --> 14:39.611
And the loser
is declared joey.

14:39.613 --> 14:41.012
Burn!

14:42.014 --> 14:43.414
Hey, how about
we make things

14:43.416 --> 14:45.083
Even more interesting?

14:45.085 --> 14:46.751
Let's say the winner

14:46.753 --> 14:49.420
Gets to publicly
humiliate the loser

14:49.422 --> 14:51.556
For an entire week?

14:51.558 --> 14:53.825
Joke's on him because,
win or lose,

14:53.827 --> 14:55.894
Next week
I'll be in madison.

14:55.896 --> 14:57.629
Future burn.

14:59.431 --> 15:01.065
Yeah, he'll feel
that one tomorrow.

15:02.167 --> 15:05.169
Get ready to
eat my exhaust.

15:05.171 --> 15:07.171
You'll never
catch the falcon.

15:07.173 --> 15:08.806
( squawks )

15:10.409 --> 15:12.410
You'll never catch
the wad-bag.

15:12.412 --> 15:14.178
( brays )

15:16.415 --> 15:18.082
That's the sound
a wad-bag makes.

15:18.084 --> 15:19.550
Oh, wait.

15:19.552 --> 15:21.753
You already knew that.

15:30.429 --> 15:33.498
Why is everyone in
your family acting
so weird today?

15:33.500 --> 15:35.833
The rooneys are
moving to madison
tonight.

15:35.835 --> 15:37.735
You're moving?
What?

15:37.737 --> 15:38.836
Yeah, I know.

15:38.838 --> 15:40.438
I took it
pretty hard myself.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.040
But you have to
embrace it, diggie.

15:42.042 --> 15:44.442
<i>After all,</i>
<i>if nothing ever changed,</i>

15:44.444 --> 15:46.077
There would be
no butterflies.

15:48.013 --> 15:49.614
Yeah,
I'll miss you too, buddy.

15:52.818 --> 15:55.553
Let's light this candle.

16:10.903 --> 16:12.470
( beeps )

16:14.073 --> 16:16.140
( kids cheering )

16:29.121 --> 16:31.122
As I looked at
my fellow rocketeers,

16:31.124 --> 16:32.523
I realized

16:32.525 --> 16:33.958
If I became rocket king

16:33.960 --> 16:36.094
And left the next day,

16:36.096 --> 16:37.228
Who would lead them?

16:37.230 --> 16:39.764
I had to let artie win.

16:39.766 --> 16:41.566
He was my nemesis,

16:41.568 --> 16:44.502
But he was also
the club's best hope.

16:48.974 --> 16:50.274
( screams )

16:50.276 --> 16:52.010
-  <i>( crashing )</i>
<i>- all: Ooh!</i>

16:53.612 --> 16:55.780
Losing the race
bruised my pride.

16:55.782 --> 16:59.250
Smashing into the stairs
bruised my shoulder,

16:59.252 --> 17:01.185
My knees

17:01.187 --> 17:02.587
And my kidney.

17:06.025 --> 17:07.091
( cheering )

17:08.727 --> 17:11.062
Yeah!  Whoo!

17:11.064 --> 17:12.196
I won.

17:12.198 --> 17:15.600
I am the rocket king.

17:15.602 --> 17:19.237
Lead them well,
wad-bag.

17:19.239 --> 17:20.638
Lead them well.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.607
Whoo!  Yeah!

17:27.013 --> 17:32.116
Were you just gonna
move away without
saying goodbye?

17:32.118 --> 17:34.052
Well, I was
gonna tell you,

17:34.054 --> 17:35.253
But then I got
really hurt

17:35.255 --> 17:37.255
When you blew me off
after reading my note.

17:37.257 --> 17:40.258
The one that I wrote
on the basketball,

17:40.260 --> 17:42.193
Like one does
when one is terrified

17:42.195 --> 17:43.194
Of getting hurt,

17:43.196 --> 17:44.729
Like one did.

17:47.099 --> 17:51.769
I must have smudged it
with my basketball
pig sweat.

17:51.771 --> 17:53.771
What did it say?

17:56.141 --> 17:58.609
I like you, diggie.

18:00.579 --> 18:02.213
I like you too,
maddie.

18:02.215 --> 18:04.315
( chuckles )

18:04.317 --> 18:05.783
Coming through, people.

18:05.785 --> 18:08.319
Tunnels don't
fill themselves.

18:10.322 --> 18:11.789
Ignore him.
Stay focused.

18:11.791 --> 18:13.791
Okay.

18:13.793 --> 18:15.793
If you're moving,

18:15.795 --> 18:17.261
I want you
to have this.

18:17.263 --> 18:20.898
And not because
you're cold.

18:20.900 --> 18:22.266
But because...

18:22.268 --> 18:24.969
This means
something to me.

18:25.904 --> 18:27.772
Like you do.

18:34.746 --> 18:35.646
<i>Diggie!</i>

18:39.651 --> 18:42.120
I knew you'd come by.

18:42.122 --> 18:43.788
Couldn't let your
best pal leave town

18:43.790 --> 18:45.623
Without saying goodbye,
huh?

18:47.126 --> 18:48.259
( clears throat )

18:48.261 --> 18:50.261
( sighs )

18:50.263 --> 18:52.196
I really like you,
man.

18:57.836 --> 18:59.804
Oh.

18:59.806 --> 19:02.974
The doorjamb where
mom and dad marked our heights.

19:02.976 --> 19:04.475
I was always an eighth
of an inch taller than
maddie,

19:04.477 --> 19:07.411
Not that it matters...
But it does.

19:09.248 --> 19:10.915
Listen up!

19:10.917 --> 19:13.384
We have some big news.

19:14.319 --> 19:15.987
Maddie and diggie
are officially

19:15.989 --> 19:17.054
In like with each other.

19:17.056 --> 19:18.823
( squeals )
finally.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.391
The birth of miggie.

19:20.393 --> 19:22.994
Yeah, don't do that.

19:22.996 --> 19:24.795
Aw, I kind of
like it.

19:24.797 --> 19:26.797
I hate it.

19:26.799 --> 19:28.132
( chuckles )

19:28.134 --> 19:30.067
I'm so glad you guys
are finally together.

19:32.137 --> 19:33.671
( groans )
this is too much.

19:33.673 --> 19:35.006
I mean,
we can't leave.

19:35.008 --> 19:36.874
Our entire lives
are here.

19:36.876 --> 19:39.343
I don't care
what mom and dad say.

19:39.345 --> 19:42.280
I am staging
a live-in.

19:42.282 --> 19:43.381
Who's with me?

19:47.286 --> 19:49.187
Hey, kids.

19:52.291 --> 19:56.027
So I see
you guys have packed.

19:56.029 --> 19:58.029
We are not letting you
sell the house

19:58.031 --> 19:59.230
And move us
to madison.

19:59.232 --> 20:00.431
Sell the house?

20:00.433 --> 20:02.300
Where on earth
did you get that idea?

20:02.302 --> 20:04.001
From when you
facegabbed us.

20:04.003 --> 20:05.870
We heard your whole
devious plan.

20:06.838 --> 20:08.139
Yeah.

20:08.141 --> 20:09.807
And I heard you
talking about dad's new pants.

20:09.809 --> 20:12.410
( grunts )
gross!

20:14.013 --> 20:17.348
When your father looks
even remotely fashionable

20:17.350 --> 20:19.283
I have to
encourage that.

20:19.285 --> 20:21.819
It's true.

20:21.821 --> 20:23.387
It's like
training a seal.

20:24.756 --> 20:26.157
And second of all,

20:26.159 --> 20:27.291
I don't know what
you think you heard

20:27.293 --> 20:28.826
On facegab,

20:28.828 --> 20:30.161
But we are not
moving to madison.

20:30.163 --> 20:31.796
We're just going there
for the weekend.

20:32.898 --> 20:35.366
You mean I filled in
my tunnels for nothing?

20:36.835 --> 20:38.069
Tunnels?

20:39.304 --> 20:40.938
Stuff just got real.

20:44.409 --> 20:46.344
( gasps )

20:46.346 --> 20:48.379
Wait.

20:48.381 --> 20:50.414
You're saying I have to
go to school with artie

20:50.416 --> 20:52.350
On Monday?

20:54.019 --> 20:56.153
I will be upstairs
packing for madison...

20:56.155 --> 20:57.822
And crying.

20:57.824 --> 20:59.290
Mostly crying.

21:01.560 --> 21:03.928
Why were you keeping
this trip such a secret?

21:05.097 --> 21:07.298
All right.
Might as well come clean.

21:07.300 --> 21:09.767
Exterminators
are tenting our house.

21:09.769 --> 21:11.469
We're infested
with beetles.

21:11.471 --> 21:13.137
Bugs?

21:19.177 --> 21:21.245
Wait.  You can't
exterminate the beetles.

21:21.247 --> 21:25.416
I spent forever
breeding those suckers.

21:26.385 --> 21:28.953
This whole thing
is your fault?

21:28.955 --> 21:30.821
Don't blame me.
Blame the beetles.

21:30.823 --> 21:33.291
You know what?
I'm gonna go have
a word with them.

21:33.293 --> 21:36.961
Get out of that hole
right now.

21:38.163 --> 21:40.164
We need to talk,
young man!

21:40.166 --> 21:41.499
We know
you're in there.

21:44.336 --> 21:45.369
I'm going in.

21:49.408 --> 21:52.310
Wow.

21:52.312 --> 21:53.811
So...

21:53.813 --> 21:55.513
Looks like
you're staying.

21:58.183 --> 21:59.417
We've said
some things.

22:00.585 --> 22:01.952
We sure did.

22:03.455 --> 22:05.489
I guess things are
gonna be different
from now on?

22:05.491 --> 22:07.525
Yeah, I guess.

22:09.328 --> 22:11.495
So... S'up?

22:12.464 --> 22:13.464
Stuff.

22:13.466 --> 22:15.032
( chuckles )

22:15.034 --> 22:16.300
Bam, what?

22:16.302 --> 22:17.902
( giggles )

22:19.037 --> 22:20.504
Whoa.

22:22.140 --> 22:23.407
How did I get here?

22:26.311 --> 22:27.845
Joey rooney,

22:27.847 --> 22:31.315
As loser of the great
rocket chair race,

22:31.317 --> 22:34.518
Let the public shaming
begin.

22:34.520 --> 22:36.287
( cymbals crash )

22:39.858 --> 22:42.259
( students laughing )

22:45.397 --> 22:47.465
You have to
wear this all week.

22:47.467 --> 22:49.433
So remember to
keep it clean,
rooney.

22:53.305 --> 22:54.538
Oops.

22:54.540 --> 22:56.607
Chocolate burn.

23:00.445 --> 23:03.514
Well, there's no shame
in free pudding.

23:05.650 --> 23:07.385
<i>( school bell rings )</i>

23:13.125 --> 23:15.292
Tunnel #1 reopened.
