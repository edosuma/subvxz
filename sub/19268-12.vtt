Subtitles by CJ Entertainment

00:17.110 --> 00:20.350
Detective Min Ho sent something.

00:20.350 --> 00:23.270
Director Yeo!

00:23.270 --> 00:29.110
Find the real murderer of the Majang Room Salon case.

00:29.110 --> 00:32.870
If you fail to, I am dead.

00:32.870 --> 00:33.910
Director Yeo.

00:33.910 --> 00:36.110
Let's focus on one thing.

00:38.430 --> 00:40.980
Let's only focus on Min Ho.

00:50.240 --> 00:54.770
Help us find Min Ho or stay out of it.

00:54.770 --> 00:56.850
From now on,
I'm going to do whatever it takes.

00:56.850 --> 00:59.270
The suspect wore these kind of shoes as well.

01:00.460 --> 01:01.740
Prosecutor?

01:01.740 --> 01:07.060
Our business got shut down because of her.

01:07.060 --> 01:08.660
Mi Ho.

01:08.660 --> 01:11.810
She said she was living well with the money.

01:11.810 --> 01:15.120
Was this person someone who could've helped?

01:15.120 --> 01:16.660
Probably...

01:17.280 --> 01:18.520
He's a Detective.

01:21.200 --> 01:23.190
Are you out of your mind?

01:23.190 --> 01:26.360
Since when do we start shooting at suspects?

01:26.360 --> 01:28.360
Let go of me.

01:30.600 --> 01:32.850
What is this?

01:35.790 --> 01:37.370
Who is this bastard?

01:50.390 --> 01:51.790
Director Yeo,

01:52.900 --> 01:55.940
I think Min Ho's in danger.

01:55.940 --> 01:58.470
I'm not going to die there like that...

01:58.470 --> 02:01.240
I'm never going to die like that...

02:21.390 --> 02:22.450
Once again,

02:23.710 --> 02:25.390
I couldn't save him.

02:36.310 --> 02:39.250
All this pain started because of me.

02:43.150 --> 02:46.870
The pain is growing without my intentions.

02:49.910 --> 02:51.660
How can I...

02:54.090 --> 02:56.700
End this disaster?

02:58.550 --> 03:01.490
Final Episode

03:12.700 --> 03:15.990
Since it's midnight,
the investigation will take a while.

03:17.520 --> 03:21.120
This hill is bigger than it seems, so it'll be hard.

03:29.780 --> 03:31.020
Where are you going?

03:31.650 --> 03:34.200
I need to use the restroom.

03:46.780 --> 03:50.890
Min Ho...

04:00.860 --> 04:08.570
Ji Jin Hyuk,
I'm going to teach you a lesson.

04:28.600 --> 04:29.940
Hey,

04:29.940 --> 04:33.140
you know you aged so much in a year?

04:34.870 --> 04:38.130
Even if we die tomorrow,
let's smile today.

04:39.150 --> 04:42.200
So we will remember happy moments.

04:42.200 --> 04:44.010
Please smile.

04:45.940 --> 04:47.130
Like this.

05:09.140 --> 05:11.000
Now I know,

05:12.920 --> 05:15.130
no matter what happened,

05:16.270 --> 05:18.540
why you investigated "F"

05:19.220 --> 05:21.640
and that feeling of revenge

05:24.840 --> 05:28.620
because I'm feeling the same right now.

05:32.430 --> 05:35.200
A police officer kidnapped another officer,

05:35.200 --> 05:37.790
and there was a murder case with guns.

05:38.980 --> 05:40.970
Now,

05:40.970 --> 05:44.000
we will focus on getting Ji Jin Hyuk.

05:45.440 --> 05:47.150
This case,

05:47.670 --> 05:49.920
involving high profile information

05:49.920 --> 05:53.860
all started from false accusation of the murder.

06:00.530 --> 06:03.930
All the people who caused Min Ho's death

06:04.840 --> 06:07.000
will be found.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.990
Each and everyone of them

06:09.990 --> 06:12.410
will be responsible for this.

06:12.930 --> 06:14.780
This is our

06:15.760 --> 06:17.720
responsibility as a team.

06:18.370 --> 06:22.660
This is special investigation team's last will.

06:26.850 --> 06:28.840
Don't look at me.

06:28.840 --> 06:31.280
He has the right to the investigation.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.270
Last Quarter

07:09.730 --> 07:11.650
Did you draw the picture?

07:12.990 --> 07:16.020
Why did you want to kill Ji Jin Hyuk that much?

07:16.650 --> 07:17.860
Tell me.

07:22.090 --> 07:23.500
You don't want to?

07:26.350 --> 07:28.840
Tell me you bastard!

07:32.800 --> 07:34.530
Why did I do it?

07:45.260 --> 07:48.200
Please save m...
- Ryu Mi Ho -

07:53.820 --> 07:55.030
That bitch...

07:56.190 --> 07:59.260
I told her to ask him for help.

08:01.550 --> 08:04.220
The last text Mi Ho sent

08:04.220 --> 08:07.310
was to detective Ma Suk Ki asking for help?

08:08.670 --> 08:09.860
Yes.

08:12.880 --> 08:14.830
I lost touch with Mi Ho.

08:14.830 --> 08:17.820
You fools, what kind of trouble is it this time?

08:17.820 --> 08:19.500
It's not that...

08:19.940 --> 08:22.700
Mi Ho ran away with money...

08:22.700 --> 08:23.780
What money?

08:23.780 --> 08:25.120
I don't know.

08:25.790 --> 08:27.850
But she said she was being chased.

08:28.480 --> 08:31.460
Then why didn't you guys tell me in advance?!

08:31.460 --> 08:33.710
She said not the cops.

08:33.710 --> 08:35.710
It's...

08:35.710 --> 08:40.390
So I introduced her to a prosecutor who looked after me when I was on probation.

08:40.390 --> 08:43.130
But I think that was a mistake.

08:43.130 --> 08:47.870
She asked me to call you today.

08:58.900 --> 09:03.890
But I lost touch with her since another cop took her.

09:03.890 --> 09:05.360
A cop?

09:05.360 --> 09:06.680
Who was it?

09:06.680 --> 09:08.280
I don't know.

09:08.280 --> 09:12.540
When I went to her house,
her grandmother told me that a cop took her.

09:31.030 --> 09:32.850
48 and single.

09:32.850 --> 09:34.990
A regular cop with no special case.

09:34.990 --> 09:37.670
Just an ordinary cop for 24 years.

09:38.420 --> 09:41.230
Never been married or has a family.

09:57.390 --> 09:59.820
It's good for insomnia
- Ryu Mi Ho -

10:07.010 --> 10:10.140
Ever since, he constantly looked for her.

10:12.030 --> 10:17.760
Saying that the promise that he will protect can't be broken like this.

10:17.760 --> 10:20.050
He was determined to find her.

10:22.230 --> 10:24.280
She's only 18,

10:25.040 --> 10:27.530
yet to fulfill her dreams,

10:30.230 --> 10:31.480
just a young girl.

10:36.030 --> 10:37.260
But...

10:39.360 --> 10:41.320
Ji Jin Hyuk that bastard,

10:45.560 --> 10:48.290
I should've shot him earlier.

10:48.290 --> 10:53.470
I lost all those opportunities trying to find her body.

10:56.390 --> 10:58.230
And it's killing me.

11:02.940 --> 11:04.760
There is time for revenge.

11:07.080 --> 11:08.980
When you lose the chance...

11:11.100 --> 11:12.930
everything becomes more complicated.

11:25.280 --> 11:27.590
We are from the investigation team on the prosecutor's side.

11:29.930 --> 11:33.220
We have to take Ma Suk Ki with us.

11:34.210 --> 11:35.100
Take him.

12:14.020 --> 12:15.120
Hey!

12:16.030 --> 12:18.190
I'm so sorry, I didn't see you.

12:20.830 --> 12:21.720
Wait...

12:23.730 --> 12:24.650
Excuse me.

12:24.650 --> 12:26.410
Who are you?

12:30.770 --> 12:34.800
Ji Jin Hyuk started coming to Lee Byung Man's host bar?

12:35.730 --> 12:37.170
His head must've got big.

12:37.170 --> 12:38.150
Yes.

12:38.770 --> 12:40.500
What a reckless cop.

12:40.500 --> 12:43.420
He could've been Lee Byung Man's driver if he asked.

12:43.420 --> 12:48.760
Then Ji Jin Hyuk might have wanted Lee Byung Man dead, right?

12:48.760 --> 12:52.590
But everything changed recently.

12:52.590 --> 12:57.850
Ji Jin Hyuk was acting like a prince with his head up.

13:00.530 --> 13:03.750
Acting like he owns everything now...

13:05.260 --> 13:06.650
Since when?

13:07.580 --> 13:09.070
Not long ago.

13:09.070 --> 13:10.300
A week?

13:10.300 --> 13:17.590
So Lee Byung Man tried to stop him by going around and collecting $500,000.

13:17.590 --> 13:20.310
So all the host bars were out of cash.

13:20.310 --> 13:21.440
$500,000?

13:31.230 --> 13:34.060
Ji Jin Hyuk's Secret Agent
- Wee Soon Chul -

13:48.940 --> 13:50.170
Move your hand.

14:05.220 --> 14:06.220
Jordan?

14:09.700 --> 14:11.540
Where is this bastard?

14:11.540 --> 14:13.520
Really, where is he?

14:13.520 --> 14:17.500
I prepared his ID card and passport,

14:17.500 --> 14:19.530
but he disappeared without paying.

14:19.530 --> 14:21.410
I'm dying too.

14:25.440 --> 14:28.250
Didn't show up after all this preparation.

14:31.580 --> 14:34.090
I was wrong.

14:36.980 --> 14:38.650
This is something big.

14:41.360 --> 14:44.200
Host Bar Prince
- Lee Byung Mang's House -

14:55.620 --> 14:57.500
Internal Investigation for a year.

14:57.500 --> 15:00.340
Lee Byung Man was in hiding.

15:00.340 --> 15:04.030
All the call history contacts have been approved.

15:04.620 --> 15:08.660
The only exception is Ji Jin Hyuk's fake phone.

15:09.350 --> 15:10.660
And...

15:12.080 --> 15:13.590
114?

15:17.590 --> 15:18.780
I'll give you everything.

15:19.970 --> 15:23.230
All the investigation records for the past year,

15:23.730 --> 15:27.100
the list of people involved with Lee Byung Man,
and all the evidence.

15:31.430 --> 15:33.370
It seems like you came as the boss.

15:33.370 --> 15:35.250
What do we have to give you in return?

15:36.030 --> 15:39.100
The girl, Ryu Mi Ho, who was listed in probation

15:39.100 --> 15:42.910
and the killer, Ji Jin Hyuk.

15:44.730 --> 15:47.640
Do you have any evidence that Ji Jin Hyuk killed her?

15:48.700 --> 15:51.520
We tried but nothing came out.

15:51.520 --> 15:54.500
We're still searching for Ji Jin Hyuk.

15:55.860 --> 15:58.650
We were only able to locate her last place.

16:00.250 --> 16:01.660
Where is that?

16:02.930 --> 16:06.090
She was sent to be murdered.

16:06.090 --> 16:09.980
But they quickly closed it down.

16:09.980 --> 16:12.700
Even if you go,
there won't be anything.

16:14.330 --> 16:16.620
Finding out what you can't see is part of an investigation.

16:17.290 --> 16:20.660
Murder Agency
Fake HR Department

16:30.350 --> 16:35.800
They murder people leaving no traces of evidence.

16:35.800 --> 16:38.700
Do you think they would've left any evidence behind?

16:39.750 --> 16:42.850
They disappeared after killing an 18 year old...

16:43.520 --> 16:44.770
Wait.

16:45.590 --> 16:47.540
This is really strange.

16:47.540 --> 16:49.900
Whenever Lee Byung Man has someone killed,

16:49.900 --> 16:52.640
he sends them away to a different country.

16:52.640 --> 16:55.190
But just to kill a girl with so many people involved...

16:55.190 --> 17:00.300
Why did they do it here in Korea?

17:01.360 --> 17:05.030
It's because they can't kill multiple people at once.

17:13.460 --> 17:15.450
Lee Byung Man has a scar on his forehead.

17:15.450 --> 17:17.230
It's not a scar from hitting something.

17:17.230 --> 17:19.990
He must've been hit by something.

17:19.990 --> 17:22.440
So I called the hospital where he got treated,

17:22.440 --> 17:24.560
and they said he removed glass pieces.

17:24.560 --> 17:27.930
Thursday the 13th,
so a week ago.

17:27.930 --> 17:30.720
Someone hit the prince with a bottle.

17:37.900 --> 17:39.040
Hi.

17:39.040 --> 17:42.040
Did anybody else's fingerprints show up at Ji Jin Hyuk's house?

17:42.350 --> 17:43.200
No.

17:43.200 --> 17:46.950
Only Ji Jin Hyuk's fingerprints were there,
but they were all ruined.

17:46.950 --> 17:48.170
Ruined?

17:48.900 --> 17:49.680
Why?

17:50.370 --> 17:52.270
Someone wearing gloves must have been here.

17:52.920 --> 17:54.160
Okay, I understand.

17:56.270 --> 17:58.560
Someone else...

17:59.700 --> 18:02.490
The host bar murder was at 1 AM.

18:02.490 --> 18:04.130
Ji Jin Hyuk went home right away.

18:04.140 --> 18:06.230
Then the investigation team followed.

18:06.890 --> 18:11.050
3 hours later,
the police went to the site.

18:12.110 --> 18:15.200
He used the time in between to find something.

18:17.440 --> 18:18.990
What was he looking for?

18:21.980 --> 18:23.500
Director Yeo, I'm over there.

18:23.500 --> 18:25.340
There's something unusual.

18:26.350 --> 18:29.060
Something even bigger than what Ji Jin Hyuk imagined.

18:29.060 --> 18:31.970
Ji Jin Hyuk knew one of Lee Byung Man's flaws.

18:31.970 --> 18:36.740
They were going to do the trade,
but the murder case happened.

18:36.740 --> 18:38.350
What were they going to trade?

18:39.340 --> 18:40.220
$500,000...

18:42.680 --> 18:43.410
A flaw...

18:47.880 --> 18:49.590
As soon as Ji Jin Hyuk got involved,

18:50.390 --> 18:53.460
he kidnapped Min Ho and made us find the real killer.

18:54.520 --> 18:56.540
But he killed him now, which means...

18:57.870 --> 18:59.850
He has another way to live.

19:02.350 --> 19:04.030
So what Ji Jin Hyuk has is...

19:05.650 --> 19:06.750
The file.

19:09.970 --> 19:11.850
It was a report for a missing phone.

19:16.940 --> 19:18.560
Were you guys unable to find it?

19:19.160 --> 19:21.420
It shows that there was communication with 114.

19:21.420 --> 19:22.200
No,

19:22.200 --> 19:24.630
We found the phone after 2 days.

19:24.630 --> 19:26.230
But he never came to pick it up.

19:29.350 --> 19:33.420
He called every hour to ask about the phone.

19:33.420 --> 19:36.770
But why didn't he come pick it up?

19:37.270 --> 19:38.830
Why do you think he didn't come?

19:39.440 --> 19:40.560
Well...

19:41.030 --> 19:43.140
The SIM card was missing.

19:44.880 --> 19:46.330
SIM card...

19:48.040 --> 19:50.090
Where was the phone found?

19:50.640 --> 19:52.660
It was in Dong Jak Goong.

19:53.760 --> 19:55.360
Dong Jak Goong...

19:58.280 --> 19:59.530
Mi Ho's house...

20:04.700 --> 20:09.480
Lee Byung Man lost the phone right before Mi Ho went missing.

20:16.730 --> 20:18.780
Lee Byung Man's lost phone...

20:19.260 --> 20:21.410
Ryu Mi Ho stealing the money and goes missing...

20:21.410 --> 20:23.410
Lee Byung Man getting hit...

20:23.410 --> 20:25.250
All happened early last week.

20:26.740 --> 20:29.450
Mi Ho Stole Lee Byung Man's phone.

20:29.450 --> 20:33.570
She took the SIM card out near her house.

20:34.820 --> 20:37.430
The SIM card is the key.

20:38.420 --> 20:40.880
Ryu Mi Ho was trying to bring that into the office.

20:41.780 --> 20:42.870
That's it.

20:43.560 --> 20:46.090
Ji Jin Hyuk intercepted it in the middle,

20:46.090 --> 20:49.170
and Lee Byung Man tried to make a deal.

20:50.430 --> 20:51.880
Information was leaked.

20:53.990 --> 20:56.290
Now I get why he showed his face.

20:57.510 --> 20:59.420
When secrecy is the key,

20:59.910 --> 21:02.450
Lee Byung Man failed.

21:04.390 --> 21:05.810
Wait...

21:06.590 --> 21:13.610
Why did Ji Jin Hyuk kidnap Min Ho instead of using the SIM card.

21:16.950 --> 21:20.480
Maybe he didn't have the SIM card when he was running away.

21:22.050 --> 21:26.540
That's why he came back to Seoul.

21:26.540 --> 21:27.690
To find it.

21:28.390 --> 21:32.330
First, he used Min Ho to find the real murderer,

21:32.330 --> 21:34.680
then he was looking for the SIM card.

21:35.360 --> 21:38.110
And searching his own home means...

21:42.420 --> 21:44.440
it's still unfound.

21:47.420 --> 21:49.910
It's Ji Jin Hyuk's key to live,

21:49.910 --> 21:51.570
and for someone else,
it's the key for survival.

21:52.690 --> 21:54.870
There was a battle.

21:55.460 --> 21:58.690
We just need to know where it is.

21:59.990 --> 22:01.140
Where could it be?

22:05.300 --> 22:06.900
Where could he have put it?

22:08.770 --> 22:10.650
His house or...

22:12.640 --> 22:13.650
his car.

22:17.130 --> 22:22.350
Ji Jin Hyuk ran away barefoot,
so he didn't even take his phone.

22:35.110 --> 22:36.430
Hey, it's me.

22:36.430 --> 22:39.080
Where is Ji Jin Hyuk's car?

22:41.060 --> 22:42.150
Okay.

22:44.100 --> 22:45.970
It's in No Won parking lot.

22:46.350 --> 22:47.940
I'll request a team over there.

22:47.940 --> 22:48.860
No.

22:49.720 --> 22:52.210
If he sees police,
he will run away again.

22:55.750 --> 22:56.360
Hello.

22:56.360 --> 23:00.290
Director Baek, we got a report saying that he entered Seoul.

23:00.290 --> 23:01.610
He's in Seoul.

23:04.200 --> 23:05.180
Where is he?

24:05.380 --> 24:06.300
It's Ji Jin Hyuk!

24:10.790 --> 24:12.290
He's entering the parking lot.

24:27.260 --> 24:29.020
He's running away!

25:27.930 --> 25:29.860
Someone's taking the car!

25:34.520 --> 25:35.370
A ghost?

25:35.790 --> 25:36.580
A partner?

26:20.710 --> 26:21.650
He got away.

27:21.120 --> 27:22.170
Park Min Ho...

27:28.300 --> 27:29.350
Min Ho?

28:50.250 --> 28:53.130
I found something! Over here!

28:54.010 --> 28:55.650
Don't touch it!

29:01.760 --> 29:02.660
Where's the body?

29:03.030 --> 29:03.870
There isn't one.

29:15.210 --> 29:18.580
Detective Park Min Ho

29:25.600 --> 29:26.750
What are you going to do now?

29:27.460 --> 29:31.790
I'm already dead, there isn't even a place to hide.

29:32.890 --> 29:36.310
We're doing anything to live.

29:40.070 --> 29:41.250
Go in there.

30:10.410 --> 30:13.200
Listen to me carefully,
or else you're dead.

30:14.750 --> 30:17.230
We're going to look for something.

30:18.430 --> 30:21.280
Something that will save both of our lives.

30:24.540 --> 30:26.320
You want me to help a criminal?

30:26.920 --> 30:28.350
So you chose.

30:28.790 --> 30:34.230
Either you die here or live like an officer until the end.

30:41.740 --> 30:43.100
Park Min Ho you bastard.

30:49.250 --> 30:52.440
But why would he be helping Ji Jin Hyuk?

30:53.620 --> 30:54.710
I don't know.

30:56.720 --> 31:00.560
We have to believe in him for now.

31:03.420 --> 31:06.880
There is a high chance that he told Min Ho everything.

31:08.030 --> 31:09.920
Then probably asked him for help.

31:10.710 --> 31:13.960
Then he won't easily kill Min Ho.

31:15.250 --> 31:17.910
But as soon as he gets the SIM card...

31:19.470 --> 31:21.850
It's dangerous for 'ghosts'.

31:24.440 --> 31:28.740
From now on, he'll get more aggressive.

31:29.490 --> 31:34.170
That means Min Ho is going to be in more danger.

31:35.920 --> 31:36.940
This is going to be a problem.

31:38.710 --> 31:43.690
No matter what,
we have to find Ji Jin Hyuk first.

31:47.590 --> 31:49.970
What can Ji Jin Hyuk do next?

31:49.970 --> 31:53.660
Now that he got what he wanted,
his option is...

31:56.720 --> 31:57.950
only one thing.

32:15.270 --> 32:16.810
Hey, help me with this.

33:18.990 --> 33:20.600
You bastard.

33:20.600 --> 33:23.220
Ji Jin Hyuk has what he wanted,

33:23.220 --> 33:25.570
why is he still dragging Min Ho around?

33:26.210 --> 33:28.050
I don't know.

33:30.480 --> 33:32.050
It's Min Ho!

33:35.000 --> 33:39.140
The battery is at 70%.
We don't have time.

33:40.330 --> 33:43.270
Stop chasing me and save your fellow officer.

33:45.020 --> 33:47.430
Video phone call.
Only 2 hours.

33:47.430 --> 33:49.820
We need to hurry!
We don't have time!

34:20.650 --> 34:21.409
Director Yeo,

34:22.219 --> 34:24.920
we just located him.

34:25.360 --> 34:27.600
We're on our way. You?

34:27.600 --> 34:29.570
The prosecutors are searching for him.

34:30.100 --> 34:32.719
It might be faster to find Min Ho if we find Ji Jin Hyuk.

34:32.719 --> 34:34.670
Okay, we have to hurry.

34:34.670 --> 34:36.469
Min Ho is bleeding a lot right now.

34:40.820 --> 34:43.960
Ghost

37:15.440 --> 37:16.340
You bastard.

37:16.940 --> 37:17.830
Where's Mi Ho?

37:18.920 --> 37:19.770
Hey!

37:21.130 --> 37:23.080
Where's my Mi Ho?

37:23.560 --> 37:24.490
Hey!

37:24.740 --> 37:25.690
Hey!

37:26.990 --> 37:29.250
I said where's my Mi Ho?

37:30.840 --> 37:32.440
Mi Ho!

37:34.620 --> 37:35.890
Hey!

37:40.150 --> 37:41.410
You bastard!

37:43.450 --> 37:44.980
The ghost came by.

38:03.840 --> 38:04.790
Min Ho!

38:06.840 --> 38:07.770
Park Min Ho!

38:08.920 --> 38:09.840
Min Ho!

38:14.120 --> 38:15.110
Min Ho!

38:21.330 --> 38:22.840
Min Ho!

38:24.960 --> 38:26.280
Park Min Ho!

38:26.920 --> 38:28.600
I'll call for back up.

38:34.090 --> 38:36.370
Revenge is the purest emotion.

38:37.690 --> 38:40.980
If you have no feelings,
revenge won't exist.

38:41.850 --> 38:43.450
Or sadness...

38:43.450 --> 38:44.640
Or madness...

38:45.870 --> 38:47.880
Just cold metal.

38:49.180 --> 38:50.250
And that is...

38:52.090 --> 38:53.310
a ghost.

39:15.940 --> 39:17.050
Wait!

39:17.200 --> 39:18.630
Pay attention please.

39:21.270 --> 39:23.270
Thank you so much for coming out

39:24.180 --> 39:25.820
but please take out all your guns

39:29.770 --> 39:31.340
and put them in this truck.

39:31.340 --> 39:34.180
What kind of nonsense is that?

39:34.180 --> 39:35.300
I'm really sorry,

39:36.320 --> 39:38.000
but I can't trust anyone right now.

39:38.730 --> 39:40.980
Especially those with a police badge.

39:41.950 --> 39:44.890
Someone could just recklessly fire shots.

39:48.740 --> 39:50.090
Thank you.

40:41.570 --> 40:45.940
Min Ho! The battery...

40:47.370 --> 40:49.870
Min Ho!

40:58.470 --> 41:00.630
Park Min Ho!

41:32.030 --> 41:32.960
Pay attention!

41:34.280 --> 41:35.760
Everybody, please pay attention!

41:36.240 --> 41:38.880
Please find the container with lights coming out.

41:38.880 --> 41:40.900
Hurry up! Now!

41:41.820 --> 41:42.780
Light...

41:44.000 --> 41:45.020
That's right! Light!

42:03.050 --> 42:04.240
I found him!

42:11.040 --> 42:12.080
Min Ho!

42:14.210 --> 42:15.420
Get the medics!

42:15.420 --> 42:16.780
Get them now!

42:16.780 --> 42:17.960
Min Ho.

42:19.460 --> 42:20.330
Min Ho.

42:21.530 --> 42:22.330
Are you okay?

42:24.330 --> 42:25.190
Hey!

42:29.300 --> 42:30.660
Director...

42:40.820 --> 42:42.230
He's bleeding too much.

42:45.980 --> 42:49.030
Running away is too hard.

43:00.230 --> 43:05.880
Do you know what all the fuss over Ji Jin Hyuk was about?

43:13.730 --> 43:25.910
I had a feeling that he hid something big in his car.

44:25.990 --> 44:26.970
This job is...

44:32.060 --> 44:36.310
a pain in the ass until the end.

44:37.900 --> 44:38.970
Please be aware.

44:47.410 --> 44:49.210
Tell the medics to hurry up!

45:03.770 --> 45:04.700
What are you guys doing?

45:05.100 --> 45:06.760
Ji Jin Hyuk is dead.

45:06.760 --> 45:10.440
We need a word with Detective Park.

45:12.050 --> 45:15.060
Are you guys trying to kill him?

45:15.060 --> 45:16.220
Look at him.

45:16.920 --> 45:18.340
Let him get treated first.

45:18.340 --> 45:19.560
He won't run away.

45:23.730 --> 45:24.970
Then lets do this.

45:33.790 --> 45:34.940
Detective Park,

45:36.450 --> 45:38.470
by any chance,

45:39.540 --> 45:41.460
did Ji Jin Hyuk talk about Mi Ho?

45:43.080 --> 45:43.870
No.

45:44.750 --> 45:49.220
I was locked up for the most part.

45:49.220 --> 45:51.220
So we didn't talk much.

45:53.410 --> 45:54.930
You went through a lot.

46:00.480 --> 46:01.440
But,

46:03.550 --> 46:06.040
weren't you being investigated?

46:11.060 --> 46:13.050
There was no progress.

46:18.700 --> 46:20.380
What happened?

46:20.380 --> 46:23.240
Detective, what's going on?

46:24.780 --> 46:27.700
Shh!

46:29.390 --> 46:31.190
I knew this was going to happen.

46:32.810 --> 46:33.950
What's wrong?

46:34.240 --> 46:35.980
It's the ghost.

46:37.730 --> 46:39.340
What are you talking about?

46:39.340 --> 46:42.080
The people who are after that SIM card.

46:45.440 --> 46:46.410
Wait.

46:47.430 --> 46:48.410
You stay here.

46:52.710 --> 46:54.010
Detective!

47:23.360 --> 47:25.440
The thing that you have...

47:26.800 --> 47:27.950
What is it?

47:29.420 --> 47:30.640
It's...

47:30.640 --> 47:32.760
just a SIM card.

47:35.620 --> 47:37.650
You have it with you?

47:39.450 --> 47:40.390
Yes.

47:58.990 --> 48:00.220
What are you doing?

48:02.550 --> 48:03.600
Give it to me.

48:07.500 --> 48:08.610
Give it to me.

48:32.050 --> 48:33.410
Life is always like that.

48:34.390 --> 48:38.090
When everything seems right,
something goes wrong.

48:40.070 --> 48:42.340
Life is tiring.

48:42.340 --> 48:43.880
So don't feel bad.

48:45.140 --> 48:48.560
The innocent driver might die because of you.

50:09.690 --> 50:11.470
The ghost finally appears.

50:14.520 --> 50:16.850
Where is my Mi Ho!

50:30.870 --> 50:32.230
Mi Ho!

50:33.280 --> 50:34.690
Mi Ho!

50:36.930 --> 50:38.480
Mi Ho!

51:02.190 --> 51:05.030
Hey, Min Ho is okay.

51:29.220 --> 51:30.860
Ghosts never hide.

51:32.820 --> 51:34.750
They always stay near.

51:35.910 --> 51:37.540
But we fail to notice them.

51:40.410 --> 51:41.440
Like you.

51:56.310 --> 51:57.910
Take off your clothes.

51:57.910 --> 51:59.680
Are you serious?

52:01.900 --> 52:07.010
Okay... Please put that gun down.

52:56.210 --> 53:00.620
Please save m...

53:23.090 --> 53:26.360
I can give it back to you.

53:34.120 --> 53:37.760
What a useless life I have...

54:24.670 --> 54:26.730
How many time will I die in one day?

54:28.010 --> 54:33.170
The Majang Dong host bar murder case has been solved.

54:33.170 --> 54:38.370
40 of the former officers have been arrested.

54:38.370 --> 54:43.170
It has been discovered that the police have framed

54:43.170 --> 54:48.510
and falsely accused another officer for the murder.

54:48.510 --> 54:56.150
The former detective, Ma, has not formally made a statement yet.

54:58.800 --> 55:00.950
When you clean,

55:01.790 --> 55:03.620
you throw away trash,

55:05.260 --> 55:08.980
but sometimes we throw away something useful.

55:13.340 --> 55:14.820
In the end,

55:15.510 --> 55:19.320
I'll have to take off my uniform.

55:20.910 --> 55:23.680
The police has to be in business even without me.

55:25.780 --> 55:28.180
I had too many dangerous members.

55:29.020 --> 55:31.370
No matter how smart the dog is,

55:31.370 --> 55:33.210
if he doesn't know who's the owner,

55:33.210 --> 55:35.010
he's useless.

55:36.650 --> 55:38.090
Do you know what I'm talking about?

55:39.310 --> 55:40.420
Yes, I do.

55:44.220 --> 55:46.360
I'm going to die,

55:48.580 --> 55:51.620
but you have to live.

56:02.780 --> 56:05.270
It's not being able to recognize the owner.

56:06.670 --> 56:09.150
I didn't have an owner to being with.

56:34.760 --> 56:37.830
Detective Min Ho,
please don't get hurt anymore!
From Eun Jeong

56:47.150 --> 56:49.200
What brings you here?

56:49.200 --> 56:51.750
Just...

56:52.430 --> 56:55.400
I've just been thinking of you lately.

56:55.980 --> 56:58.020
I just came to see how you were doing.

57:00.660 --> 57:02.090
Are you okay?

57:02.650 --> 57:06.700
Yeah, the world is just a little scary.

57:09.110 --> 57:10.730
But,

57:10.730 --> 57:12.210
I'll be fine.

57:14.210 --> 57:15.300
How about you, dad?

57:16.760 --> 57:18.580
Well,

57:20.960 --> 57:24.250
I think I'll be fine from now on too.

57:25.690 --> 57:27.440
Because I have a good son.

57:36.420 --> 57:37.660
What brings you here?

57:39.950 --> 57:41.820
- Letter of Resignation -

57:42.490 --> 57:43.790
To say goodbye.

57:45.050 --> 57:46.960
Are you really quitting?

57:46.960 --> 57:49.560
We still have a lot to finish.

57:50.300 --> 57:52.420
Even without us, you're going to make another team anyways.

57:53.830 --> 57:57.520
Well, if there are qualified people, I sure would.

57:58.320 --> 58:01.630
Lower your standards because it'll be hard to find.

58:07.430 --> 58:08.470
I'll be leaving now.

58:11.630 --> 58:12.480
Hey.

58:16.560 --> 58:18.100
Please don't shut the door.

58:54.280 --> 58:56.750
You guys are no longer useful,

58:59.650 --> 59:01.160
so we'll get rid of the team.

59:04.760 --> 59:06.750
When I made the team,

59:07.800 --> 59:10.850
I had goals but they're no longer important.

59:13.650 --> 59:18.990
Those upset face are getting tiring as well.

59:22.360 --> 59:25.780
Your face was never full of happiness either.

59:34.530 --> 59:37.940
You guys can go back to your old selves.

59:37.940 --> 59:42.050
Also, please delete all the numbers you have.

59:44.110 --> 59:49.010
Nobody wants a drunk phone call.

59:51.900 --> 59:54.750
You're such an interesting person.

59:56.740 --> 01:00:00.000
Well it's a clean end.

01:00:04.750 --> 01:00:07.230
Okay.

01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:11.920
Since we've agreed that we won't see each other anymore,

01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:21.220
let's take a picture.

01:00:58.080 --> 01:00:59.440
Please smile.

01:01:14.150 --> 01:01:17.090
One, two, three.

01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:32.080
They say it's been 8 years.

01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:37.130
He's such a civil man, why is he here?

01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:39.490
He killed a man.

01:04:39.490 --> 01:04:40.900
Very violently.

01:04:41.930 --> 01:04:45.020
A normal man with a wife and kids.
