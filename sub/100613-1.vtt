00:05.056 --> 00:08.200
This, is Fairy Tale Island.

00:08.530 --> 00:11.780
A magical land of princes and princesses

00:12.281 --> 00:13.981
witches and monsters.

00:14.910 --> 00:19.330
Accidents and strange events
happen all the time.

00:19.500 --> 00:21.880
And that's when people call us.

00:22.250 --> 00:26.960
The Fearless Seven, the greatest
heroes on Fairy Tale Island.

00:27.008 --> 00:29.300
Especially me, Merlin.

00:30.008 --> 00:33.930
But everything changed
the day we defeated a dragon

00:34.140 --> 00:35.850
and saved a Princess.

00:37.520 --> 00:41.650
We thought we'd saved a witch,
so, we attacked her.

00:42.110 --> 00:44.860
But we were wrong.

00:45.270 --> 00:48.820
She wasn't a witch, she was a princess.

00:48.860 --> 00:51.200
The Fairy Princess!

00:51.530 --> 00:54.130
How were we supposed to know?
She looks like a witch,

00:54.131 --> 00:57.231
and everyone knows that a
princess doesn't look like a witch.

00:58.290 --> 01:02.830
Anyways, she wanted to teach us a lesson,
so she put a curse on us.

01:03.032 --> 01:05.000
And this was a nasty one.

01:05.170 --> 01:09.590
that turned us into little ugly green
monsters whenever people looked at us.

01:10.008 --> 01:11.880
And the only way to break the curse

01:11.930 --> 01:15.930
is to get a kiss from the
most beautiful woman in the world.

01:16.470 --> 01:18.270
Are you kidding me?

01:18.350 --> 01:20.016
With this face?

02:07.270 --> 02:08.860
Hello, your majesty.

02:08.979 --> 02:11.740
- Good morning ma'am.
- Good morning ma'am.

02:15.660 --> 02:19.620
Magic tree, magic tree...

02:19.870 --> 02:25.710
Let this morning be the time
that you perform your duty,

02:31.000 --> 02:39.000
of bringing me the shoes
of youthful eternal... beauty.

02:47.270 --> 02:48.270
Yes!

02:49.570 --> 02:51.280
Change me!

02:53.650 --> 02:55.110
Finally!

03:00.024 --> 03:02.160
Not again! How long must I wait?

03:02.290 --> 03:04.000
- No. - Clear these away.

03:04.001 --> 03:05.001
Uh-oh.

03:04.790 --> 03:05.580
Heads off.

03:05.750 --> 03:07.330
Pull yourself together.

03:11.130 --> 03:12.170
Here you are.

03:13.008 --> 03:15.130
Oh? Thanks!

03:38.570 --> 03:41.830
That wasn't here before.
What is she up to now?

04:01.631 --> 04:02.631
Huh?

04:23.370 --> 04:24.370
Huh?

04:28.210 --> 04:29.710
You weren't here before.

04:34.340 --> 04:35.340
Whatever.

04:39.970 --> 04:41.300
Oh! Oww!

04:45.470 --> 04:46.470
Yes!

04:49.600 --> 04:54.016
I can't believe my beloved daughter
Snow White has turned eighteen.

04:54.190 --> 04:59.900
I only wish her mother could see the kind of
smart and beautiful young woman she's become.

05:00.490 --> 05:03.370
Strange thing happened during the party.

05:03.570 --> 05:07.290
The castle guards brought in
a woman named Regina.

05:07.500 --> 05:13.290
They said she was a witch,
but she was too beautiful to be a witch.

05:13.380 --> 05:17.840
I have married Regina.
Everything feels so perfect!

05:18.420 --> 05:24.850
Except for Regina's strange looking mirror.
There's something not quite right.

05:25.470 --> 05:29.730
People around the castle have been
disappearing, one by one.

05:29.890 --> 05:32.520
Is it because of that peculiar mirror?

05:32.600 --> 05:37.570
I saw it with my own eyes,
Regina talking to a tree.

05:37.610 --> 05:39.940
She must be a witch!

05:40.440 --> 05:44.296
I should send Snow away to a safer place.

05:44.320 --> 05:49.540
My dear Snow, by the time you read this,
my fate will be uncertain.

05:49.870 --> 05:51.710
She's coming for me now.

05:51.830 --> 05:56.500
I only hope you can find the
Fearless Seven, and ask them for help.

05:58.170 --> 05:59.260
Apples...

05:59.340 --> 06:02.380
... the most suspicious of fruits.

06:04.007 --> 06:05.007
Oh,

06:05.008 --> 06:08.100
Papa, where are you?

06:11.810 --> 06:13.390
But they don't look dangerous.

06:30.580 --> 06:31.227
Regina?

06:31.251 --> 06:34.420
No, my shoes! Get her!

06:43.760 --> 06:45.106
- Can I borrow this?
- Okay.

06:45.130 --> 06:46.130
Thanks!

07:00.570 --> 07:01.730
What?

07:03.024 --> 07:05.400
Nooo!!!!!

07:12.950 --> 07:15.540
Short, chubby, and green.

07:16.790 --> 07:18.420
Green is like an ogre.

07:18.460 --> 07:21.670
Blue or yellow could've made us look cute.
And cuddly.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.550
Quit your complaining, Merlin!

07:24.670 --> 07:28.390
I'm figuring out how to take this curse
and kick it where the sun don't shine.

07:28.590 --> 07:33.016
Listen, we need to find the most
beautifullest princess to kiss us,

07:33.140 --> 07:35.048
and we've just about run out of options.

07:35.560 --> 07:40.110
How would a beautiful woman
even see you, Mister Invisible?

07:42.940 --> 07:45.110
- What was that?
- Some kind of bird?

07:49.870 --> 07:52.790
Magic mirror, full of wisdom,

07:52.910 --> 07:55.960
who's the fairest in the Kingdom?

07:56.290 --> 07:59.210
The woman who wears the red shoes.

08:01.290 --> 08:04.186
And side note, wisdom and
kingdom don't really rhyme.

08:04.210 --> 08:07.970
Cut the sass and tell me her name!

08:08.970 --> 08:10.840
How should I know?
I don't get out much.

08:10.930 --> 08:13.180
Well, you are the magic mirror.

08:13.350 --> 08:17.866
Magic is just my first name,
it's short for Magichard. Like Richard.

08:17.890 --> 08:20.310
What can you do then?

08:20.480 --> 08:24.900
I just reflect what I see,
the truth. The truth is,

08:24.980 --> 08:29.820
that you should see yourself right now.
Right now!

08:31.240 --> 08:32.320
Watch it.

08:32.950 --> 08:38.000
Distribute wanted posters to every town,
village, valley, forth and forge in the kingdom,

08:38.120 --> 08:39.830
and find her!

08:41.630 --> 08:43.340
I feel my power draining.

08:43.460 --> 08:47.300
I don't have much time.
The aging is accelerating.

08:47.590 --> 08:50.720
And only three bumbling
bits of kindling for help.

08:50.840 --> 08:54.930
Perhaps you should recruit another, someone
who stands to gain from your success.

08:54.970 --> 08:56.970
What about this fellow?

08:57.810 --> 09:00.016
Interesting.

09:00.520 --> 09:04.650
Tell me more, Magichard.

09:05.690 --> 09:07.836
Hey hey, Over here! Over here!

09:07.860 --> 09:09.360
See, see. Come! Very quick.

09:09.400 --> 09:10.860
Look at this. Look, look, look.

09:11.990 --> 09:12.990
What is it?

09:17.540 --> 09:19.710
I know a lot about silhouettes,

09:19.910 --> 09:22.096
and I think this shape is a witch.

09:22.120 --> 09:25.540
Let's not jump to conclusions.
Yes, it could be a witch.

09:25.630 --> 09:26.500
...Or

09:26.630 --> 09:27.500
Ya. It's a witch

09:27.630 --> 09:29.590
The witch who cursed us?

09:29.670 --> 09:31.680
Let's catch her and make
her break the spell!

09:50.570 --> 09:51.001
En garde!

09:51.025 --> 09:52.950
Wands where I can see 'em, witch!

10:01.959 --> 10:02.959
Fraulein!

10:02.960 --> 10:04.000
No No No! Stop!

10:04.032 --> 10:06.340
I get you some revenge!

10:10.210 --> 10:11.300
Beautiful!

10:11.630 --> 10:14.470
I didn't know anyone could be so beautiful.

10:14.550 --> 10:16.100
How did she end up with us?

10:23.520 --> 10:27.336
Hello, dear lady. Welcome to my
home slash command post.

10:27.360 --> 10:29.980
I have six room mates
but my name's on the lease.

10:30.024 --> 10:31.440
I pay the rent.

10:31.650 --> 10:36.056
Your home? Oh my gosh,
I am... I am so sorry.

10:36.200 --> 10:37.966
I was starving and...

10:37.990 --> 10:39.990
No need to apologize.

10:40.240 --> 10:42.886
We didn't mean to interrupt
your stolen meal.

10:42.910 --> 10:46.106
If you're still hungry,
I can whip up something simple.

10:46.130 --> 10:48.226
- You see I, marinate the solution and...

10:48.250 --> 10:49.380
Who is that?

10:50.709 --> 10:51.709
Uhh...

10:51.710 --> 10:52.970
Who?

10:59.760 --> 11:02.930
Wow. I look so different.

11:03.270 --> 11:05.980
I mean, my face, and my waist,
and my waist and...

11:06.016 --> 11:07.100
My waist?

11:07.730 --> 11:10.730
Oh my gosh! What happened to me?

11:15.780 --> 11:20.280
Oh, I must've gotten up so
quickly my back is killing me.

11:21.200 --> 11:23.032
You mean your head, right?

11:23.580 --> 11:27.000
- Do you need help?
- No, I'm fine.

11:30.590 --> 11:34.800
Is that really what I look like?
In the mirror? Do you see the same thing?

11:34.970 --> 11:36.630
You're beautiful, miss.

11:36.760 --> 11:38.340
Like an angel!

11:38.510 --> 11:39.510
Really?

11:40.640 --> 11:41.810
Could it be?

11:42.008 --> 11:43.946
Excuse me, but who are you?

11:43.970 --> 11:45.480
Oh... I'm Snow...

11:45.730 --> 11:46.600
Snot?

11:46.690 --> 11:48.230
No no no no no no.

11:49.690 --> 11:51.520
My name is...

11:52.320 --> 11:53.690
R-Red Shoes.

11:55.110 --> 11:57.990
Yep. It's me. Red Shoes.

11:58.056 --> 12:02.620
Cool name, but, by any chance
would that be Princess Red Shoes?

12:02.660 --> 12:04.426
Of course, she's a princess!

12:04.450 --> 12:07.436
How could she be so beautiful if she weren't?

12:07.460 --> 12:09.370
Obviously! Right, miss?

12:09.460 --> 12:12.420
Obviously, I mean I am a princess.

12:13.550 --> 12:14.920
Who are you guys?

12:14.960 --> 12:17.040
I'm Merlin.

12:17.130 --> 12:19.610
Part time hero, full time romantic.

12:20.470 --> 12:23.736
And this is Jack, Hans, Arthur,
Pino, Noki and Kio.

12:23.760 --> 12:27.350
No way, your names are
the same as the F-Seven.

12:27.480 --> 12:30.206
The Fearless Seven.
I'm looking for them.

12:30.230 --> 12:33.016
Let me guess,
Merlin's your favourite?

12:33.900 --> 12:36.024
No, not really.

12:36.056 --> 12:38.240
No, that Merlin's not your type.

12:38.320 --> 12:41.240
You seem like a Prince Arthur fan to me.

12:41.370 --> 12:44.910
Honestly, none of them are
really my type.

12:46.659 --> 12:47.659
Oh.

12:47.660 --> 12:49.580
Well. That's fine.

12:49.750 --> 12:53.008
Because we're not them, we're
actually completely different people.

12:53.032 --> 12:57.816
In no way are we the same guys, put under
a curse, and changed into different forms.

12:57.840 --> 13:01.016
But only if someone looks at us,
It's very complicated.

13:01.040 --> 13:02.080
Right. We're all clear.

13:03.140 --> 13:05.810
So how can I assist you, my fair lady?

13:06.100 --> 13:07.810
I need to find my father,

13:07.930 --> 13:09.810
and I know that the F-Seven can help.

13:10.480 --> 13:14.820
We know the F-Seven very well,
and their schedule is fully booked.

13:14.980 --> 13:17.820
Leave it to me,
I'll find your father within the month.

13:17.860 --> 13:19.466
I can do it in one week.

13:19.490 --> 13:21.216
- Four days! - Three days!

13:21.240 --> 13:22.530
- Two days! - One!

13:22.610 --> 13:23.507
Oomph!

13:23.531 --> 13:25.740
I already found your
father like, two weeks ago.

13:25.830 --> 13:26.910
Really?

13:26.990 --> 13:29.976
I just need a few days
to get him across state lines.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.009
I seriously need to find my dad.

13:32.033 --> 13:36.460
Hold on. Nobody has seen the F-Seven
in over a year, right?

13:36.590 --> 13:39.920
You're not going to find them now,
we're your best bet.

13:41.300 --> 13:44.680
Wow. No-ones offered to
help me for such a long time.

13:45.680 --> 13:46.826
You guys are awesome

13:46.850 --> 13:50.180
Really? You think we are awesome?

13:50.230 --> 13:55.536
Yeah, you guys are caring, and sweet, and...

13:55.560 --> 13:58.400
And not completely hideous to look at?

13:58.570 --> 14:01.780
No, you guys are totally adorable.

14:01.820 --> 14:03.700
I think I hit her too hard.

14:03.740 --> 14:06.620
But she is beautiful.

14:07.780 --> 14:10.250
She can help me break the curse.

14:15.250 --> 14:18.500
Who is coming to my birthday party?

14:18.590 --> 14:20.486
Has Ariel RSVP'd?

14:20.510 --> 14:23.196
She says she can't make it, sir.
She has to wax her legs.

14:23.220 --> 14:24.510
But she's a mermaid!

14:24.590 --> 14:25.736
What about Sleeping Beauty?

14:25.760 --> 14:26.984
Doctor's appointment.

14:27.008 --> 14:29.156
- Is she sick?
- Says she has insomnia.

14:29.180 --> 14:31.456
If she's not gonna sleep,
she can come to our party.

14:31.480 --> 14:32.496
What about Rapunzel?

14:32.520 --> 14:35.666
And don't tell me she's
getting her hair done.

14:35.690 --> 14:38.900
Nope. It's something called, uh, book.

14:38.980 --> 14:39.957
Princess Cruise?

14:39.981 --> 14:41.126
That's a ship, sir.

14:41.150 --> 14:41.837
Princess Leia?

14:41.861 --> 14:43.032
She's a general!

14:43.056 --> 14:45.780
I demand glorious guests!

14:45.990 --> 14:49.256
How can I be any more unpopular!

14:49.280 --> 14:51.950
And I don't understand, why?

14:54.460 --> 14:57.266
Greetings, Prince Average.

14:57.290 --> 14:59.840
It's pronounced Avv-vous-rarge.

14:59.960 --> 15:01.340
Sure it is.

15:01.630 --> 15:05.236
If you're here for the 'We Love
Our Peasants' group giveaway,

15:05.260 --> 15:08.140
that motion is ended.
Grab your wrinkles and go.

15:08.300 --> 15:09.300
Move along.

15:13.560 --> 15:17.166
Do you think that people would respect you,

15:17.190 --> 15:24.056
if you celebrated your birthday with
a beautiful woman on your arm?

15:24.360 --> 15:27.546
Finally, someone talking sense!

15:27.570 --> 15:29.426
This horrible crone gets it!

15:29.450 --> 15:32.120
May I suggest inviting

15:32.490 --> 15:34.710
this young lady?

15:35.790 --> 15:38.556
She's beautiful, when can she get here?

15:38.580 --> 15:40.420
Well, that's up to you.

15:40.540 --> 15:44.130
You see, she's stolen something from me.

15:44.340 --> 15:50.220
You find her, bring her along with you,
and you won't look like such a loser,

15:50.390 --> 15:53.520
and I get my shoes back.

15:53.680 --> 15:55.706
Fear not, loyal hag.

15:55.730 --> 15:57.850
I, Prince Average,

15:57.980 --> 16:01.860
shall find this fugitive,
and make her pay for her crimes,

16:01.980 --> 16:04.024
by making her attend my birthday party.

16:05.150 --> 16:07.570
There shall be balloons!

16:07.650 --> 16:11.056
I just thought of it.
Let's have a lot of balloons!

16:11.370 --> 16:13.240
What a buffoon.

16:21.840 --> 16:23.800
It looks just like papa.

16:29.630 --> 16:31.220
Papa won't recognise me.

16:37.140 --> 16:41.560
Why won't... why won't these
shoes just come off?

16:48.200 --> 16:50.910
Yes, this is me.

16:59.210 --> 17:02.880
Would you like to join me
in a moisturising mask?

17:03.032 --> 17:06.000
Oh, thanks, oh. But I am...

17:06.919 --> 17:07.919
Oh!

17:07.920 --> 17:08.976
So tired.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.300
Are you sure?

17:10.470 --> 17:13.276
It's very important to take
care of your skin.

17:13.300 --> 17:14.300
Positive.

17:16.430 --> 17:19.810
But this is the finest French
recipe meant to hydrate skin.

17:20.230 --> 17:22.520
It is made of French poopee!

17:23.859 --> 17:24.859
Papa?

17:26.016 --> 17:30.360
Hmm. A spell that makes you fall in love.

17:30.650 --> 17:32.110
Oh, there it is.

17:32.450 --> 17:34.740
Merlin! Have you seen my cook book?

17:34.780 --> 17:36.990
Have you checked in the kitchen?

17:37.160 --> 17:40.540
Ah, silly me! The kitchen. Of course!

17:43.032 --> 17:44.960
Now, where was I?

17:45.750 --> 17:48.000
Merlin, have you seen my moisturizer?

17:49.590 --> 17:50.985
- It's nowhere to be... - No!

17:51.009 --> 17:54.196
Whatever it is, I haven't seen it.
Now please, go away.

17:54.220 --> 17:56.300
Someone's got anger management issues.

18:00.390 --> 18:02.980
Getting a kiss was never
a problem with this face.

18:05.810 --> 18:06.820
Red Shoes?

18:08.860 --> 18:10.190
Papa?

18:10.860 --> 18:12.610
Papa? Are you there?

18:13.530 --> 18:14.570
Papa?

18:37.510 --> 18:41.810
Boys! I'm telling you. Sweet treats are
the way to a woman's heart.

18:44.140 --> 18:47.336
It works! I call it, an auto portrait.

18:47.360 --> 18:48.992
I call it, the duplicatertron.

18:49.016 --> 18:50.506
I call it, selfie!

18:50.530 --> 18:52.216
Red Shoes must love it!

18:52.240 --> 18:53.716
Monsieur, monsieur.

18:53.740 --> 18:56.410
She doesn't want sweets and selfies.

18:56.570 --> 18:58.910
Women want diamonds.

18:59.160 --> 19:00.160
Merlin?

19:06.420 --> 19:10.210
The Book of Spells To Make You Fall In Love?

19:14.340 --> 19:18.016
Okay, big, terrifying, wooden bunny.

19:18.040 --> 19:19.510
You're a nice bunny.

19:20.310 --> 19:22.520
You're a Vegan bunny, right?

19:26.100 --> 19:28.480
What was that? Lightning?

19:28.610 --> 19:31.110
Actually, it's called magic. I do it.

19:31.150 --> 19:33.400
Really? Then do some!

19:34.440 --> 19:36.150
¶ Darling...

19:37.570 --> 19:41.200
¶ Wish you could see what can I see

19:41.740 --> 19:45.500
¶ Miles ahead just you and me

19:45.870 --> 19:48.880
¶ To infinity

19:54.130 --> 19:56.976
Keep running, and whatever
you do, don't look back.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.300
But I can't leave without you.

19:58.550 --> 20:00.800
You're looking back. Don't do that.

20:01.040 --> 20:02.040
But...

20:02.760 --> 20:04.640
Hate to zap you longears,

20:04.850 --> 20:07.310
But I need to impress a beautiful woman.

20:07.480 --> 20:09.666
Big, scary bunny! Over here!

20:09.690 --> 20:11.690
Red! Stop putting yourself in...

20:13.900 --> 20:15.570
...danger...

20:35.340 --> 20:37.040
Arthur! I got you.

20:37.300 --> 20:39.776
It's no use, Red Shoes.

20:39.800 --> 20:43.486
I'm slippin' away. Not much time...

20:43.510 --> 20:46.656
Just... need to... use that core of mine...

20:46.680 --> 20:49.190
I see the light at the end of the funnel.

20:49.440 --> 20:52.916
Time for me to kick the bucket

20:52.940 --> 20:54.956
I had a good run. I was God blessed.

20:54.980 --> 20:58.990
Oh, I used to be able to bench two fifty!

20:59.200 --> 21:02.386
Before I go, how about a farewell kiss?

21:02.410 --> 21:05.450
Red Shoes! Thank goodness you're safe.

21:05.700 --> 21:08.436
Do you need CPR? I'm basically an expert.

21:08.460 --> 21:10.726
And don't worry, I brushed my teeth.

21:10.750 --> 21:13.000
No, No, No. I'm fine, but Arthur, he's stuck.

21:13.032 --> 21:14.516
He tried to save me and...

21:14.540 --> 21:16.000
Would you get up?

21:16.420 --> 21:18.040
What? He's not hurt?

21:18.210 --> 21:20.630
- Only his pride.
- Seriously Arthur?

21:20.760 --> 21:23.180
You need to find a better
way to hit on girls.

21:32.520 --> 21:35.400
Stand back! I may have to risk my life.

21:44.700 --> 21:46.580
Someone call for three inventors?

21:46.740 --> 21:48.200
For three geniuses?

21:48.790 --> 21:50.290
That sounds like us!

21:51.540 --> 21:55.008
Everyone came runnin' to help,
great, just great.

21:55.032 --> 21:56.776
Everyone except Merlin, that is.

21:56.800 --> 21:59.000
Ah! Super, there he is now.

21:59.630 --> 22:00.527
Where have you been?

22:00.551 --> 22:03.316
Something awful could've happened
to Red if I hadn't shown up.

22:03.340 --> 22:04.430
You?

22:05.180 --> 22:07.390
Don't even go there!

22:07.760 --> 22:09.930
I saved her first.

22:11.048 --> 22:12.980
- Right?
- I was worried about you.

22:13.100 --> 22:15.048
I was worried about me too.

22:15.360 --> 22:18.206
- But mostly you.
- No-one needs to worry.

22:18.230 --> 22:20.490
Arthur's here. Please, my lady.

22:20.610 --> 22:21.900
Um... Okay.

22:31.160 --> 22:33.250
You shouldn't go into the
forest by yourself.

22:33.460 --> 22:38.500
It's a nightmarish landsacpe, fit only for
bloodthirsty warriors like myself.

22:38.920 --> 22:40.040
...And squirrels.

22:40.210 --> 22:41.920
I thought I saw my father.

22:42.590 --> 22:45.340
Turned out, just to be that big bunny.

22:45.510 --> 22:49.510
Well, if you ever make such a dangerous
and weird mistake again,

22:49.680 --> 22:51.850
just know that I can protect you.

22:52.350 --> 22:53.666
This's very kind.

22:53.690 --> 22:58.310
And if you really want to express
your gratitude, you can...

23:00.110 --> 23:02.586
Oh, I am so sorry.

23:02.610 --> 23:07.910
This was much slappier than
I intended it to be.

23:08.280 --> 23:10.700
Oh! It happens. No problem.

23:11.410 --> 23:13.660
Maybe an apology kiss then?

23:16.290 --> 23:17.710
Bravo mon ami!

23:18.210 --> 23:19.590
Nice try.

23:20.250 --> 23:21.800
Red Shoes.

23:26.550 --> 23:30.040
Gentlemen, to break this curse, we're going
to have to work as a tightly knit team.

23:30.140 --> 23:32.048
Which means, you do everything I say.

23:32.140 --> 23:33.706
- Excuse? - Huh? - What? - No.

23:33.730 --> 23:34.497
You got to be kidding.

23:34.521 --> 23:36.770
Hans and Jack will search around the Dismal Lake.

23:36.850 --> 23:39.730
Triplets! You search the Caves Of Despair.

23:39.860 --> 23:42.900
Red Shoe and I, will go to Golden Goose Avenue.

23:43.024 --> 23:47.700
Golden Goose Avenue, which happens
to be your go to place for dates.

23:47.820 --> 23:50.056
We are going to focus on the mission.

23:50.200 --> 23:52.490
And then see where the evening takes us.

23:52.790 --> 23:56.960
The only thing you're going to shop for
on Golden Goose Avenue, is rejection.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.670
And you can't even afford that.

23:58.830 --> 24:01.436
I like my odds. You saw what she did.

24:01.460 --> 24:03.800
An expression of affection.

24:03.960 --> 24:05.800
Every woman shows it differently.

24:05.920 --> 24:07.446
You took your shot. You got slapped.

24:07.470 --> 24:08.526
May I remind you

24:08.550 --> 24:12.430
that this is the closest thing to a
kiss anyone's had since the curse.

24:13.520 --> 24:17.116
Let's work together to guide
Red Shoes' feelings towards me

24:17.140 --> 24:18.992
so we can break the curse.

24:19.016 --> 24:20.310
What about the rest of us?

24:20.360 --> 24:22.860
After I resume my princely form,

24:23.016 --> 24:25.490
the word about F-Seven will be out.

24:25.530 --> 24:29.280
Ladies will be begging to kiss your green mugs.

24:29.360 --> 24:31.160
- Really?
- Sounds reasonable.

24:31.240 --> 24:32.756
I'll bring the gelato!

24:32.780 --> 24:35.370
Getting one kiss sure is easier
than getting seven.

24:35.450 --> 24:38.346
This is not a plan,
he's just out for himself!

24:38.370 --> 24:40.396
A half baked plan is better than none.

24:40.420 --> 24:44.000
Don't worry Merlin,
I have a big assignment for you.

24:44.670 --> 24:46.260
Big assignment?

24:46.590 --> 24:48.760
Here you go. I drew these up last night.

24:49.130 --> 24:52.510
I can't tell if this drawing is terrible, or

24:53.140 --> 24:54.850
really avant garde.

24:54.970 --> 24:57.180
Oh, my neighbor's a great art teacher.

24:57.350 --> 24:58.746
Pablo Picassover?

24:58.770 --> 25:02.560
One thing's for sure,
daddy's on the big side...

25:03.150 --> 25:04.730
...of big.

25:05.900 --> 25:07.320
You must take after your mother.

25:07.530 --> 25:08.780
No, I look a lot like papa...Oh!

25:09.780 --> 25:16.032
Yeah, my mother. Gosh! We... exactly! Twins!

25:16.870 --> 25:19.726
Alright. You know the plan. Let's move.

25:19.750 --> 25:22.540
Deploy! Thunderdwarfs are go!

25:25.000 --> 25:26.500
And where d'ya think you're going?

25:26.840 --> 25:28.550
Your post is right there.

25:28.630 --> 25:31.220
You'll watch the savage monster.
I call him Vicious!

25:31.260 --> 25:32.800
I call him Woodbottom.

25:32.890 --> 25:35.330
Do not worry Merlin. We'll make
sure you get kissed too.

25:35.560 --> 25:36.760
Eventually.

25:38.350 --> 25:39.576
We'll split up here.

25:39.600 --> 25:41.350
Alright, see you later.

25:42.230 --> 25:45.190
I know exactly where we should
look to find your father.

25:45.440 --> 25:46.940
Really? Where?

25:54.990 --> 25:56.120
Daddy!

25:56.409 --> 25:57.409
Wow!

25:58.410 --> 25:59.596
Is this what I think it is?

25:59.620 --> 26:05.670
I present Excalibur, the legendary
sword trapped in this rock for centuries.

26:06.032 --> 26:09.436
Waiting for a man of great
strength to release it.

26:09.460 --> 26:12.720
It says 'Do not attempt to remove by force'.

26:12.800 --> 26:15.300
... Oh, right. I guess. Ahem.

26:15.640 --> 26:21.730
The truth is, I realized you were the woman
of my destiny the first time I saw you.

26:22.048 --> 26:24.770
I thought if I could show you my strength

26:25.016 --> 26:27.230
I would be worthy of your affections.

26:31.149 --> 26:32.149
Oh!

26:32.650 --> 26:34.636
Oops, I'll put it back.

26:34.660 --> 26:36.320
No No No! Can I have it?

26:46.710 --> 26:49.880
Oh, Arthur, it's just beginner's luck.

26:50.210 --> 26:52.470
You want me to, maybe pull
it out for you again?

26:52.720 --> 26:54.970
No, I'm not humiliated at all.

26:55.760 --> 26:56.800
Let's go.

27:06.400 --> 27:10.150
Don't look at me like that,
I'm the real prisoner here.

27:10.400 --> 27:12.490
What? You hungry?

27:13.950 --> 27:15.530
And fetch!

27:23.500 --> 27:25.250
Hop along, big guy!

27:25.460 --> 27:28.210
There's no way Arthur is
breaking this curse alone!

27:45.180 --> 27:46.270
Woah!

27:48.048 --> 27:49.810
Arthur, where're you going?

27:53.056 --> 27:54.056
Okay.

27:54.650 --> 27:55.780
See you later.

27:56.950 --> 27:57.950
Hi.

27:58.870 --> 28:00.780
Oh, look at what you made me do!

28:00.870 --> 28:01.910
You...

28:02.120 --> 28:03.330
I'm sorry.

28:03.540 --> 28:05.540
...made me make it perfect.

28:06.000 --> 28:07.000
Thank you.

28:07.501 --> 28:08.501
Woah!

28:09.580 --> 28:11.396
I'm so sorry.

28:11.420 --> 28:14.340
No, don't be. I am sorry.

28:14.670 --> 28:16.000
Are you alright?

28:16.129 --> 28:17.129
And...

28:17.130 --> 28:18.930
...don't worry about this.

28:22.180 --> 28:22.850
What?

28:23.048 --> 28:24.430
Ta-da!

28:26.850 --> 28:29.166
Excuse me, have you seen this man?

28:29.190 --> 28:31.690
¶ I'm feeling good today

28:32.440 --> 28:35.690
¶ And nothing standing in my way

28:35.860 --> 28:38.056
¶ I wouldn't change a thing

28:38.320 --> 28:41.910
¶ I must have been walking in a dream

28:42.200 --> 28:45.120
¶ Everybody wants to stop and stare

28:45.410 --> 28:48.460
¶ People talk but I don't care

28:48.620 --> 28:51.790
¶ Everybody wants to stop and stare

28:51.880 --> 28:54.880
¶ People talk but I don't care

28:55.000 --> 28:58.000
¶ Don't matter what you think or see

28:58.020 --> 29:00.520
¶ There's no-one I would rather be

29:00.930 --> 29:03.970
¶ Take me as I am this is me

29:04.140 --> 29:07.350
¶ There's no-one I would rather be

29:07.849 --> 29:09.149
¶ It don't matter

29:09.850 --> 29:12.270
¶ It don't matter to me

29:13.060 --> 29:14.860
¶ It dont matter

29:15.440 --> 29:18.490
¶ Take me as I am this is me

29:31.710 --> 29:34.516
Arthur, I was thinking.

29:34.540 --> 29:37.276
What if I just pull out the Excalibur for you?

29:37.300 --> 29:38.800
Our secret.

29:39.550 --> 29:41.736
Really? We have a secret now?

29:41.760 --> 29:42.367
Yeah.

29:42.391 --> 29:45.016
I like a girl who can keep things classified.

29:45.040 --> 29:47.310
Let's find your pops, friend.

29:47.520 --> 29:48.520
'Bye guys.

29:52.600 --> 29:53.600
What?

29:54.980 --> 29:56.940
Hey, you.

29:57.320 --> 29:58.440
No.

29:59.650 --> 30:00.650
Hey!

30:01.280 --> 30:02.280
Stop!

30:08.200 --> 30:09.200
Come on!

30:36.560 --> 30:38.770
Oh, you guys don't have to help.

30:38.900 --> 30:41.000
That's not her. Come on.

30:41.024 --> 30:42.056
Sorry miss.

30:45.820 --> 30:48.506
Red Shoes! Where has she gone?

30:48.530 --> 30:50.306
Where's Red Shoes?

30:50.330 --> 30:52.000
That's what I'd like to know.

30:52.500 --> 30:53.790
Wait a minute.

30:53.920 --> 30:55.476
Who said you could leave your post?

30:55.500 --> 30:57.540
I'm just walking the bunny.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.380
Red Shoes, where are you?

31:02.550 --> 31:04.760
Hey, have you seen this girl?

31:10.430 --> 31:11.656
Look what I found

31:11.680 --> 31:14.980
Oh, those're mine.
Can I, actually have my shoes back?

31:17.810 --> 31:20.126
No way. You're not serious, are you?

31:20.150 --> 31:23.900
I'm really not in the mood,
Can you just, please give them back to me?

31:24.740 --> 31:26.426
Ha! They won't even fit on you.

31:26.450 --> 31:28.546
They're gonna fit me better
than they fit you.

31:28.570 --> 31:29.570
Hey!

31:30.580 --> 31:31.660
Red Shoes!

31:31.790 --> 31:33.580
Guys! Guys, I'm here.

31:37.170 --> 31:40.250
- Red Shoes!
- Red Shoes! Where are you?

31:41.550 --> 31:44.170
Even the hideous dwarfs won't help you.

31:46.720 --> 31:49.470
Those dwarfs are not hideous.

31:49.600 --> 31:52.220
And I don't need anyone to help me.

31:54.230 --> 31:56.116
Freeze! Put the shoes down.

31:56.140 --> 31:58.706
Get on your knees and put
your hands behind your head.

31:58.730 --> 32:00.536
On second thought, they're yours.

32:00.560 --> 32:03.690
There's no need to push me in a corner

32:03.900 --> 32:05.780
Super scary.

32:16.410 --> 32:18.210
Your red shoes, milady.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
Thank you.

32:20.210 --> 32:22.880
Excuse me, miss, have we met?

32:24.260 --> 32:26.720
Well, that's kind of a complicated question.

32:26.840 --> 32:28.220
Red Shoes!

32:28.840 --> 32:31.390
Gotta go. Be safe.

32:51.620 --> 32:52.620
Guys!

32:55.160 --> 32:56.750
Where has she gone?

32:57.910 --> 32:59.170
Red Shoes!

32:59.580 --> 33:00.580
Stop!

33:03.460 --> 33:04.460
Hold on!

33:08.040 --> 33:09.040
Wait a minute.

33:10.220 --> 33:12.390
Gotcha now, don't we?

33:13.300 --> 33:14.310
I don't get it.

33:17.890 --> 33:20.440
Now we know how fast a
bunny can hop in a pinch.

33:20.690 --> 33:22.230
Thank you for helping me, Merlin.

33:22.400 --> 33:23.810
A pleasure, milady.

33:24.230 --> 33:26.320
But I also did it for us.

33:27.150 --> 33:29.740
By the way, what is this?

33:30.860 --> 33:32.820
Gosh, it seems silly but...

33:33.490 --> 33:34.950
... It's my shoes

33:35.910 --> 33:38.370
- They're magical.
- I know, they're fabulous.

33:38.500 --> 33:39.976
But why're they after you?

33:40.000 --> 33:44.316
No, my shoes, they're actually made of magic.

33:44.340 --> 33:45.670
Red Shoes!

33:45.960 --> 33:47.000
Are you a criminal?

33:47.340 --> 33:49.130
No, of course not.

33:49.760 --> 33:52.970
I knew a girl this pretty couldn't
possibly be a criminal.

33:53.180 --> 33:56.510
Look, we should head out now,
there could be more guards around any minute.

33:56.760 --> 33:59.640
Don't worry about them,
I've got these bad boys.

34:00.016 --> 34:02.940
This is gonna make it so much
harder to find my dad.

34:06.900 --> 34:07.940
I have an idea!

34:10.610 --> 34:15.024
¶ What a sight what I feel
when I'm looking at you

34:15.159 --> 34:18.989
¶ Like I see in the sky for
the very first time

34:19.032 --> 34:26.170
¶ And I want you to know that I've
never seen something so beautiful

34:27.550 --> 34:32.219
¶ In the stars it's a sign that
our worlds could collide

34:32.800 --> 34:36.007
¶ You and I, side by side

34:36.139 --> 34:43.139
¶ And I want you to know that I've
never seen something so beautiful

34:43.690 --> 34:44.900
Ta-da!

34:45.650 --> 34:47.770
Oh wow!

34:52.320 --> 34:53.320
What do you think?

34:53.780 --> 34:56.489
That is amazing.

34:58.024 --> 34:58.830
Thank you.

34:58.910 --> 35:03.620
¶ This is the start of something so right

35:03.830 --> 35:08.630
¶ Suddenly all of the stars have aligned

35:09.000 --> 35:12.510
¶ In the right place at the right time

35:15.840 --> 35:18.866
You had a thing on your cheek.

35:18.890 --> 35:19.970
Alright, let's go.

35:39.780 --> 35:43.200
- We've been walking for hours.
- And we'll keep walking 'till we find them.

35:50.000 --> 35:51.750
Now we got her.

35:53.260 --> 35:55.630
- Are they gone?
- Shh. Who cares? -

35:55.840 --> 35:57.340
C'mon. Let's go see.

35:58.300 --> 35:59.390
Look at that.

36:00.389 --> 36:01.389
- Wow!
- Wow!

36:01.390 --> 36:02.430
Awsome!

36:02.560 --> 36:03.497
Who's that?

36:03.521 --> 36:04.890
It's the girl's father.

36:05.048 --> 36:06.350
But where's the girl?

36:06.520 --> 36:09.520
It says to go to Risky Rock,
so she must be there.

36:10.016 --> 36:11.400
Why Risky Rock?

36:11.520 --> 36:12.756
We should ask the girl.

36:12.780 --> 36:15.150
Perfect! Where's the girl?

36:15.400 --> 36:18.740
It says to go to Risky Rock,
so she must be there.

36:19.056 --> 36:21.330
But, why Risky Rock?

36:21.490 --> 36:22.870
We should ask the girl.

36:22.739 --> 36:23.739
Umm...

36:23.740 --> 36:24.926
Where's the girl?

36:24.950 --> 36:27.556
It says to go to Risky Rock,
so she must be there.

36:27.580 --> 36:29.830
But, why Risky Rock?

36:30.032 --> 36:31.250
We should ask the girl.

36:42.588 --> 36:47.188
¶ This is the start of something so right

36:47.189 --> 36:51.189
¶ Suddenly all of the stars have aligned

36:51.289 --> 36:52.089
Oww!

36:52.690 --> 36:53.820
What was that for?

36:53.860 --> 36:56.876
You, sir, are sabotaging my
relationship with Red Shoes.

36:56.900 --> 36:59.176
What relationship are
you talking about?

36:59.200 --> 37:01.756
Red Shoes and I share a secret.

37:01.780 --> 37:04.740
I would tell you what it is,
but it's a secret.

37:04.870 --> 37:08.290
While you're busy keeping secrets,
I'm going to break my curse.

37:08.370 --> 37:10.596
You're nothing without
your spells, magic boy.

37:10.620 --> 37:13.130
And you're nothing without Excalibur.

37:13.880 --> 37:17.736
You're not waiting for someone to
pull it out for you, are you?

37:17.760 --> 37:18.800
How did you know?

37:18.920 --> 37:20.000
Is it true?

37:35.110 --> 37:36.690
Hans, you shouldn't have.

37:36.820 --> 37:39.650
Something sweet, for someone sweeter.

37:41.910 --> 37:43.256
This is spectacular!

37:43.280 --> 37:45.993
Oh, it's nothing.
Just let me know what you want.

37:46.017 --> 37:49.330
Any time, for the rest of your life.
Do you like fondue?

37:49.370 --> 37:54.590
Behold! Carved by the finest jewellers
out of all the jewellers I know

37:54.880 --> 37:56.130
which is a lot.

37:57.500 --> 37:57.977
Pretty.

37:58.001 --> 38:02.590
And it's yours, Miss Shoes,
yours in exchange for nothing.

38:02.680 --> 38:03.590
Make it a kiss.

38:03.680 --> 38:06.720
That's really sweet Jack,
but I can't accept it.

38:06.970 --> 38:09.786
I don't want your jewells,
only your good intentions.

38:09.810 --> 38:13.230
My intentions are more than good,
they're super bonne.

38:13.310 --> 38:14.400
Testing one, two.

38:14.480 --> 38:17.230
Testing one... no, I'm pushing it, you dolt.

38:17.270 --> 38:19.466
Attention! Hideous trolls!

38:19.490 --> 38:22.676
Is it dwarfs with an 'f',
or dwarves, with a 'v'?

38:22.700 --> 38:24.240
I want to use whatever's more offensive.

38:24.280 --> 38:26.330
Oh, it's that loser, Prince Average.

38:26.410 --> 38:28.596
I heard that! It's Avv-vous-rarge!

38:28.620 --> 38:29.557
Oh, please.

38:29.581 --> 38:34.976
Inside your amateurs attempt at a facade
of a sham of a travesty of a veneer of a castle

38:35.000 --> 38:38.130
is a gorgeous wanted criminal.

38:38.210 --> 38:42.760
I hereby command that all of you exit
the premises and surrender post haste.

38:42.880 --> 38:46.850
Fail to comply, and you will
never see these two again.

38:47.100 --> 38:48.720
You have until three.

38:49.008 --> 38:50.008
One.

38:52.230 --> 38:53.016
Two.

38:53.190 --> 38:54.560
I lied. Charge!

39:15.210 --> 39:16.606
Am I the person you want?

39:16.630 --> 39:18.460
Yes, yes you are.

39:18.670 --> 39:22.210
Though I don't know if you're a person
or a vision of beauty, some kind of angelic

39:22.550 --> 39:26.220
thing with wings. Angelic wing things?

39:26.590 --> 39:30.048
I will come with you,
but only after you release my friends.

39:30.260 --> 39:31.270
Do it. Do it!

39:33.310 --> 39:36.048
Now, here's the good news.
It's my birthday!

39:36.190 --> 39:39.650
And you are going to be
the belle of the ball.

39:39.690 --> 39:43.440
The invitation sounds great,
really. But...

39:43.530 --> 39:45.780
It wasn't an invitation,
more of an order.

39:45.900 --> 39:46.886
Prepare the lady's carriage.

39:46.910 --> 39:49.466
She said she doesn't want to go, Average.

39:49.490 --> 39:52.410
Avv-vous-rarge!

39:52.540 --> 39:54.160
Don't troll me, Troll.

39:54.540 --> 39:55.686
Ah! So rude.

39:55.710 --> 39:57.976
I couldn't agree more.
Subjects these days.

39:58.000 --> 39:59.130
Now. Shall we?

40:07.720 --> 40:08.720
Get her!

40:08.970 --> 40:10.656
You hold off the guards, and
I'll get her out of here.

40:10.680 --> 40:13.720
No, I'm faster. You stay
here and buy us time.

40:22.056 --> 40:22.860
Here's a thought.

40:23.056 --> 40:25.240
Stop fighting and fight!

40:26.780 --> 40:27.820
What's the plan?

40:28.860 --> 40:30.346
Rescue Red Shoes.

40:30.370 --> 40:32.280
Like the old days, guys.

41:07.280 --> 41:08.280
Arthur!

41:14.280 --> 41:16.450
Can we get this over with?
They're just dwarfs!

41:28.760 --> 41:31.220
Did you guys hear something?

41:40.270 --> 41:41.270
Come on!

42:01.670 --> 42:02.670
Duck!

42:08.840 --> 42:11.130
Hi, guards, are we taking a break?

42:11.220 --> 42:12.356
... well, FYI

42:12.380 --> 42:14.640
They're getting away!

42:21.541 --> 42:22.641
No!

42:28.650 --> 42:30.990
Who's throwin' vegetables?

42:35.530 --> 42:38.410
Yeah! You just got Merlined!

42:46.590 --> 42:47.590
Run!

42:49.000 --> 42:50.000
Jack!

43:00.720 --> 43:01.720
Duck!

43:06.650 --> 43:08.400
I'm so sorry. You alright?

43:08.520 --> 43:10.780
No. I'm not.

43:16.490 --> 43:19.490
Gentlemen, he surrenders.

43:19.700 --> 43:20.700
What?

43:50.730 --> 43:52.150
Engines. Full power.

43:52.230 --> 43:53.230
Shields up.

43:54.190 --> 43:55.740
Turn on the mini frizzer.

44:14.510 --> 44:16.000
Superhero landing!

44:16.170 --> 44:17.130
Hooray for us!

44:17.180 --> 44:19.550
- We did it!
- It was mostly me.

44:19.599 --> 44:20.599
Yeah!

44:21.100 --> 44:22.100
What?

44:25.560 --> 44:26.810
You've got to be kidding.

44:26.890 --> 44:29.400
Finally the big guns, thank you.

44:29.650 --> 44:30.650
Fire!

44:38.950 --> 44:39.950
Fire!

44:45.870 --> 44:47.410
Ooh, close.

44:47.750 --> 44:49.540
The cannonball. Not you.

44:50.250 --> 44:52.590
timeout, timeout.
Everyone, timeout.

44:52.960 --> 44:56.276
You almost blew her up, and she can't
come to my party if you blow her up.

44:56.300 --> 44:57.420
Sorry, sir.

44:57.800 --> 44:59.260
Alright. Time back in.

45:00.260 --> 45:01.470
Surrender monsters!

45:01.510 --> 45:02.680
No! Wait!

45:35.210 --> 45:36.550
Oh. That's pretty cool.

45:44.430 --> 45:46.350
Everyone inside. And hurry!

46:00.320 --> 46:02.740
You messed with the wrong prince.

46:02.910 --> 46:05.580
There is nothing average about Avv-vous-rarge.

46:05.780 --> 46:09.032
I shall return!

46:09.250 --> 46:10.187
On Tuesday.

46:10.211 --> 46:12.556
No, wait. I'll check my calendar...

46:12.580 --> 46:16.670
Thursday, I shall return Thursday!

46:18.040 --> 46:19.300
We'll be ready.

46:19.340 --> 46:20.130
And waiting.

46:20.220 --> 46:21.196
Arrivederci!

46:21.220 --> 46:22.220
Ciao for now!

46:22.300 --> 46:23.040
Bye bye!

46:23.180 --> 46:24.800
You just got dwarfed!

46:24.930 --> 46:26.970
Is that better? I think Merlined is better.

46:43.200 --> 46:47.740
You should have seen the look on his big
ugly face when bunny came running at him.

46:48.790 --> 46:50.976
That's how you see everything, isn't it?

46:51.000 --> 46:52.290
With my eyes?

46:52.500 --> 46:55.380
You always talk about
what someone looks like.

46:55.460 --> 46:57.960
I do? I wouldn't say that.

46:58.032 --> 47:00.590
But I can't wait for you
to see the real me.

47:00.880 --> 47:02.760
What kind of Merlin is the real you?

47:02.970 --> 47:04.380
You might not believe it,

47:04.470 --> 47:08.040
but the real me is famous,
handsome, and even popular.

47:08.180 --> 47:11.140
Not short, stumpy and green.

47:11.270 --> 47:14.576
Yeah, you're short, stumpy and green, but

47:14.600 --> 47:17.536
you're also a wonderful and charming person.

47:17.560 --> 47:19.056
I'm not explaining it right.

47:19.150 --> 47:22.740
If you saw the real me,
you'd know exactly what I mean.

47:23.570 --> 47:25.530
I think I can see the real you.

47:26.160 --> 47:29.370
And I like you, just as you are.

47:31.240 --> 47:32.540
That's hilarious.

47:32.830 --> 47:36.670
Here, close your eyes,
and imagine the real me.

47:37.170 --> 47:39.670
I guarantee you, it'll be different.

47:41.340 --> 47:44.970
I do feel something different ..

47:45.180 --> 47:46.180
Really?

47:46.380 --> 47:48.600
But eyes opened or closed

47:48.680 --> 47:50.930
to me you're still Merlin.

47:52.310 --> 47:56.850
Now tell me, who am I to you?

47:57.440 --> 47:58.980
You're a gift.

47:59.110 --> 48:03.320
A gift that'll transform me
into someone amazing.

48:04.024 --> 48:06.110
Just like you're amazing.

48:14.370 --> 48:17.420
Actually, I want to show you something too.

48:22.000 --> 48:23.420
You need a hand?

48:23.550 --> 48:26.930
Hold on. Nope. Stand back. I got this.

48:27.550 --> 48:29.116
...One...

48:29.140 --> 48:30.890
Two, yeah, okay, I need help.

48:49.199 --> 48:50.699
Woah. Woah woah woah.

48:50.700 --> 48:52.490
No thankyou.

48:58.580 --> 49:01.750
You know what the weird thing is?
They're super comfortable.

49:04.000 --> 49:07.356
Y'know, I'm just saying. Where were
you when the facade was falling?

49:07.380 --> 49:09.510
I mean, that was terrifying.

49:11.340 --> 49:12.430
What're you doing here?

49:14.430 --> 49:16.350
I have come for my shoes.

49:16.640 --> 49:21.016
Well, I had them. I mean I saw them.
But those dwarfs!

49:21.048 --> 49:23.570
It's dwarves with a 'v'.
So you failed?

49:24.270 --> 49:28.280
I did not fail, I took a timeout.

49:28.360 --> 49:30.386
Yeah. This is a calculated timeout.

49:30.410 --> 49:32.530
I'm going to return on Thursday,
we all pencilled it in.

49:32.660 --> 49:33.660
Silence!

49:33.950 --> 49:35.450
Have a bite.

49:36.000 --> 49:37.450
For strength.

49:38.120 --> 49:42.306
Apples, the most suspicious of fruits.

49:42.330 --> 49:45.000
I don't have much time, Prince.

49:45.300 --> 49:49.300
You could still have the
best birthday ever,

49:49.470 --> 49:50.946
But remember...

49:50.970 --> 49:57.600
What's bad for me,
will be very bad for you.

50:03.690 --> 50:04.690
She's gone.

50:05.900 --> 50:08.190
Ah! What's the worst that could happen.

50:12.240 --> 50:13.240
It's kind of sweet.

50:29.510 --> 50:30.510
Don't move.

50:30.630 --> 50:31.197
Okay.

50:31.221 --> 50:33.316
Pino, Noki Kio, show us what you got.

50:33.340 --> 50:34.276
Okey doky!

50:34.300 --> 50:35.117
Here we go!

50:35.141 --> 50:36.260
Our pleasure.

50:43.520 --> 50:46.024
... here we go, yeah, a little

50:46.048 --> 50:47.190
Oooh a little over here!

51:03.920 --> 51:05.726
Now that looks like a real home.

51:05.750 --> 51:07.710
Yep. I could get used to that.

51:07.920 --> 51:09.130
Uh uh. I cannot.

51:12.800 --> 51:15.800
It's a perfect copy of my drawing.
That's incredible.

51:17.140 --> 51:18.390
Let me try.

51:19.560 --> 51:21.920
This will definitely make it easier to
find your dad.

51:21.980 --> 51:24.286
Unfortunately, this thing aint flying.

51:24.310 --> 51:25.167
It's grounded.

51:25.191 --> 51:26.206
Why does it need to fly?

51:26.230 --> 51:28.980
The posters are no good if we
can't distribute them fast.

51:29.230 --> 51:33.150
Guys, thankyou so much for
everything you're doing.

51:33.651 --> 51:35.651
- My pleasure.
- It's nice.

52:45.230 --> 52:46.270
Opening doors!

53:02.330 --> 53:05.540
You know Merlin, I feel so
lucky that I've met you.

53:06.250 --> 53:08.120
I feel the same way.

53:08.540 --> 53:11.880
I feel like anything is possible.

53:13.210 --> 53:14.687
¶ Darling

53:16.380 --> 53:20.220
¶ Come on out there and take my hand

53:20.550 --> 53:24.350
¶ I will show you that I'm your man

53:24.430 --> 53:27.350
¶ Is that okay

53:28.140 --> 53:30.270
Merlin! Watch out!

53:41.280 --> 53:42.700
Merlin.

53:44.530 --> 53:45.580
Merlin.

53:46.870 --> 53:47.870
Merlin!

53:48.290 --> 53:49.790
Everything okay?

53:50.210 --> 53:51.420
Of course! Sure!

53:52.210 --> 53:53.476
Nothing to be embarrassed about.

53:53.500 --> 53:57.736
So why are we even talking about
that when we should be going...

53:57.760 --> 53:58.760
this direction.

53:58.920 --> 53:59.920
Hey wait!

54:03.640 --> 54:06.560
So, about these magic shoes.

54:06.720 --> 54:07.946
Why, are they still bothering you?

54:07.970 --> 54:09.980
What kind of magic do
those shoes have?

54:10.350 --> 54:13.350
Well .. how do I put this.

54:13.560 --> 54:17.320
Merlin, I used to be strong, really strong.

54:17.730 --> 54:19.966
And, I was always proud of that.

54:19.990 --> 54:25.056
But, the shoes magic, umm,
it made me a little dainty?

54:25.160 --> 54:26.216
Sorry to hear.

54:26.240 --> 54:30.540
The shoes made me lose
a little bit of weight.

54:30.750 --> 54:31.976
It could be worse.

54:32.000 --> 54:33.330
..Okay.

54:34.330 --> 54:35.920
- A lot of weight.
- Ah.

54:37.000 --> 54:41.130
Well, I know what it's like to look different on
the outside from what you feel on the inside.

54:45.800 --> 54:49.850
Merlin, I'd like to give you a
token of my appreciation.

54:51.270 --> 54:53.270
Oh, here, hand me one of your spells.

54:53.480 --> 54:53.993
Why?

54:54.017 --> 54:56.650
Oh, come on. I'm not going to zap you.

54:57.860 --> 54:58.860
Give me a second.

55:11.290 --> 55:15.170
There. Consider it your good luck charm.

55:18.630 --> 55:19.710
Thank you.

55:26.260 --> 55:30.048
Merlin, do you think we'd be happier

55:30.350 --> 55:32.560
if we were our old selves again?

55:32.730 --> 55:35.480
Yep. Yep, yep. Definately we would.

55:35.650 --> 55:36.900
I don't know.

55:38.016 --> 55:39.610
I like how we are.

55:40.360 --> 55:43.740
Right here, just, right now.

55:44.400 --> 55:48.120
Even if I'm an ugly green monster?

55:49.620 --> 55:53.200
I don't care about your height
or what colour you are.

55:54.120 --> 55:57.670
And that's the way you feel about me, right?

55:57.790 --> 56:00.920
Yes, of course. I mean, duhh!

56:02.590 --> 56:06.380
I think we're both just trapped
under the same spell.

56:22.650 --> 56:28.780
Wait. Keep your eyes closed
and don't open them until I say.

56:28.950 --> 56:31.024
When you open your eyes there will be...

56:31.240 --> 56:33.926
a handsome man in front of you.

56:33.950 --> 56:35.436
Someone worthy of you.

56:35.460 --> 56:37.670
Someone you'd be proud to be seen with.

56:38.880 --> 56:40.032
I think you're right.

56:40.130 --> 56:42.670
Ready? And...

56:43.000 --> 56:46.170
Oh, it's such a good day to break a curse!

56:48.680 --> 56:49.680
Now!

56:50.140 --> 56:51.300
Ta-da!

56:51.470 --> 56:54.470
You just got Merlined!

56:54.680 --> 56:55.850
What do you think?

56:56.270 --> 56:59.520
Mission impossibly handsome, right?

57:01.270 --> 57:04.650
Oh, it's okay,
I know this is a lot to take in.

57:04.980 --> 57:07.546
But you can let your happiness flag fly.

57:07.570 --> 57:11.490
This, this is the real me.

57:12.410 --> 57:14.490
- It's stupid.
- What?

57:15.660 --> 57:16.870
Wait a minute!

57:17.330 --> 57:19.870
My hands are still green sausages.

57:21.000 --> 57:23.170
No! I look the same.

57:23.420 --> 57:25.960
Yes, impossibly handsome.

57:26.008 --> 57:28.170
This doesn't make sense.

57:28.300 --> 57:31.300
You're the most beautiful woman in
the world, why do I look the same?

57:31.510 --> 57:33.446
What're you talking about, Merlin?

57:33.470 --> 57:34.890
Do I need a longer kiss?

57:35.350 --> 57:36.350
Two kisses?

57:37.230 --> 57:38.810
Let's try again.

57:39.349 --> 57:40.349
Umm.

57:40.350 --> 57:41.770
You're not making any sense.

57:51.024 --> 57:52.024
Hurry!

57:54.000 --> 57:55.000
What is that?

57:55.280 --> 57:57.870
This kingdom has a serious
monster problem.

58:13.760 --> 58:14.327
Are you alright?

58:14.351 --> 58:16.260
No. I'm not.

58:24.770 --> 58:25.400
Thank you.

58:25.440 --> 58:26.690
Pleasure, milady.

58:29.056 --> 58:30.056
Watch out!

58:47.670 --> 58:49.710
Ha-hah! Yes!

58:55.800 --> 58:58.286
What do they want,
besides smashing us?

58:58.310 --> 58:59.310
I don't know!

59:08.320 --> 59:09.860
The old me would've nailed that.

59:18.370 --> 59:19.740
You just got Merlined!

59:30.710 --> 59:31.710
Hurry!

59:47.100 --> 59:48.586
Red, close your eyes.

59:48.610 --> 59:50.456
This is no time for kissing, Merlin.

59:50.480 --> 59:52.610
Trust me. Close your eyes.

59:53.820 --> 59:55.490
Please, close them!

01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:01.580
That was too close.

01:00:02.370 --> 01:00:03.790
Don't look at me.

01:00:03.950 --> 01:00:05.976
You see that tree on the
other side of the bridge?

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:06.597
Yeah.

01:00:06.621 --> 01:00:09.646
On my signal, run towards
it as fast as you can.

01:00:09.670 --> 01:00:11.170
No, I can't leave you here.

01:00:11.340 --> 01:00:14.550
You have to.
And don't look back, okay?

01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:17.120
Look right at that tree until I say it's safe.

01:00:17.220 --> 01:00:18.816
Promise you won't look.

01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:21.310
Okay. I promise.

01:00:21.890 --> 01:00:22.890
Now!

01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:55.396
What?

01:00:55.420 --> 01:00:57.720
You just got Merlined?
Oh. Yes you did.

01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:28.460
Hey! Locate!

01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:31.250
Hey, locate here!

01:01:31.540 --> 01:01:34.590
You're even more of a blockhead
than Prince Average.

01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:39.260
Avv-vous-rarge!

01:01:39.550 --> 01:01:41.040
Prince Average?

01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:58.860
You just got Merlined.

01:02:02.450 --> 01:02:03.780
Take a look, Red Shoes.

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:04.677
Merlin!

01:02:04.701 --> 01:02:07.160
I have triumphantly saved the day.

01:02:08.330 --> 01:02:09.330
Merlin, no!

01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:13.032
Merlin!

01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:19.170
Merlin!

01:03:23.990 --> 01:03:25.490
Snow White?

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.670
Snow White?

01:03:37.032 --> 01:03:39.880
The thief was Snow White
this whole time?

01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:43.470
Interesting. She could remove the shoes.

01:03:45.260 --> 01:03:47.720
You're going after her yourself?

01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:49.350
What? Were you going to go?

01:03:50.048 --> 01:03:52.560
I get it! I don't have legs.

01:03:55.140 --> 01:03:58.520
So, here I am.

01:03:59.610 --> 01:04:00.770
All the real me.

01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:03.820
I bet you're disappointed, huh?

01:04:04.024 --> 01:04:07.086
You're the girl from Golden Goose Avenue.

01:04:07.110 --> 01:04:07.677
Red Shoes!

01:04:07.701 --> 01:04:11.032
That's not my name, it's Snow White.

01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:13.676
Princess Snow White? So your father is...

01:04:13.700 --> 01:04:16.120
King White, yeah.

01:04:16.460 --> 01:04:20.032
By the time I figured out his
new wife Regina was a witch

01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:22.880
he'd already disappeared.

01:04:23.420 --> 01:04:25.946
And the monsters who attacked us

01:04:25.970 --> 01:04:29.970
were sent by my stepmother
to get these shoes.

01:04:31.260 --> 01:04:34.220
I guess being beautiful is really
worth that much to her.

01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:37.480
Have you thought about
just giving them back?

01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:40.110
And give up their magic?

01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:44.900
If I'd given up their magic, you wouldn't
have helped me find my father, would you?

01:04:45.860 --> 01:04:47.200
Would you?

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.480
I thought we were both
under the same spell.

01:04:54.700 --> 01:04:58.000
But I see now that I was wrong.

01:04:58.420 --> 01:05:03.920
Listen, I can't get into all the details,
but I'm under a curse too.

01:05:04.340 --> 01:05:06.260
You still don't get it, Merlin.

01:05:07.470 --> 01:05:09.970
I'm not talking about our curses.

01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:13.470
Merlin, I'm talking about
the kind of spell

01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:16.770
you never want to break.

01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:07.990
He likes you more than he likes me.

01:06:39.890 --> 01:06:43.230
What would've happened if she'd taken
off her shoes that day in the barn?

01:06:43.270 --> 01:06:44.690
You think that's important?

01:06:47.270 --> 01:06:49.032
I just wonder,

01:06:49.056 --> 01:06:52.024
what I would've done if I'd
seen the real Snow White.

01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:53.660
Seriously?

01:06:53.740 --> 01:06:56.024
It's still all about appearance for you.

01:06:56.240 --> 01:06:58.950
No! Not exactly.

01:06:59.950 --> 01:07:02.790
But I can't live looking like
you for the rest of my life

01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:07.250
Kind of proving my point, other me.
Alright. Let's try this.

01:07:07.750 --> 01:07:10.420
Who do you like more,
Snow White or Red Shoes?

01:07:10.590 --> 01:07:12.510
Easy, it's Red Shoes.

01:07:12.670 --> 01:07:15.340
Now, which of us do you
think Red Shoes likes more?

01:07:15.430 --> 01:07:17.140
Easy, it's me!

01:07:19.048 --> 01:07:21.680
Wait. No.

01:07:22.270 --> 01:07:23.440
It's...

01:07:23.810 --> 01:07:24.850
you.

01:07:46.330 --> 01:07:51.670
¶ You came in my life in a high flash of lightning

01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:56.720
¶ I covered my eyes but there's no use in hiding

01:07:56.800 --> 01:08:00.890
¶ This feeling has stuck and I couldn't say

01:08:00.970 --> 01:08:02.220
You're a gift.

01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:04.222
A gift that'll transform me

01:08:04.246 --> 01:08:06.576
into someone amazing.

01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:11.320
¶ This is the start of something so right

01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:16.359
¶ Suddenly all of the stars have aligned

01:08:16.700 --> 01:08:21.410
¶ In the right place at the right time

01:08:21.700 --> 01:08:26.750
¶ This is the start of something so right

01:08:27.580 --> 01:08:31.550
Well, I know what it's like to look different on
the outside to what we feel on the inside.

01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:37.000
¶ This is the start of something so right

01:08:42.008 --> 01:08:49.689
¶ This is the start of something so right

01:08:51.359 --> 01:08:52.520
Look at that!

01:08:57.200 --> 01:09:00.256
The shoes. You're wearing them.

01:09:00.279 --> 01:09:01.990
I thought you left.

01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:03.740
You should take them off again.

01:09:09.032 --> 01:09:10.032
I can't.

01:09:10.830 --> 01:09:13.800
You just had to make things complicated.

01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:16.220
Maybe this will help.

01:09:16.420 --> 01:09:18.776
Eat the apple, and they'll slide right off.

01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:19.930
Where did you get that?

01:09:20.220 --> 01:09:22.510
I want to help you, Snow White.

01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:23.760
Please.

01:09:30.439 --> 01:09:31.439
Red Shoes?

01:09:32.015 --> 01:09:33.015
Merlin?

01:09:33.939 --> 01:09:34.939
Merlin?

01:09:37.779 --> 01:09:40.240
What terrible timing you have.

01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:45.240
We're gonna have to do this the hard way.

01:09:45.950 --> 01:09:46.950
Regina?

01:09:50.370 --> 01:09:53.340
Such a tender family reunion.

01:09:53.670 --> 01:09:55.800
So sad we can't stay!

01:09:56.630 --> 01:09:57.710
Red Shoes!

01:10:00.180 --> 01:10:02.116
Come on, let's go, longears.

01:10:02.140 --> 01:10:03.696
Hey! Wait for us!

01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:05.760
How 'bout you go back
and get the others?

01:10:05.930 --> 01:10:07.890
And make lots of copies of this.

01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:09.480
Let's go!

01:10:11.980 --> 01:10:13.336
We can do this.

01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:14.360
Yeah!

01:10:16.780 --> 01:10:19.240
Your power my lady. It has drained you.

01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:23.200
You think? I don't need
you to tell me how I look.

01:10:23.370 --> 01:10:25.596
I'm a mirror. It's what I do.

01:10:25.620 --> 01:10:28.516
M - I - R - O - R.
I can't spell.

01:10:28.540 --> 01:10:29.540
Enough.

01:10:30.710 --> 01:10:31.960
Bind her.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.130
It's snack time.

01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:40.970
How can you sleep at
a time like this?

01:10:42.630 --> 01:10:45.326
I'm not supposed to talk
when I have this on,

01:10:45.350 --> 01:10:48.770
but I got to ask.
Do you think they've kissed yet?

01:10:48.850 --> 01:10:49.850
I hope so,

01:10:49.930 --> 01:10:52.890
because it'll feel better to
punch Merlin when he's pretty.

01:10:54.100 --> 01:10:57.296
We've been waiting for a...
Where have you been?

01:10:57.320 --> 01:10:58.336
Did you break the curse yet?

01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:00.024
Merlin, are you hungry?

01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:01.360
Those are bears.

01:11:01.399 --> 01:11:02.399
Ah...

01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:05.280
Hi? This is from Merlin.

01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:25.640
Wow! This is so cool.

01:11:29.510 --> 01:11:30.890
Okay, sword.

01:11:31.048 --> 01:11:35.850
If you think you've humiliated, embarrassed,
and otherwise frustrated me,

01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:37.520
you're right.

01:11:38.016 --> 01:11:41.690
But that ends now!

01:11:51.290 --> 01:11:53.330
Oh, zut alors. Please end this.

01:12:04.970 --> 01:12:09.076
Hey! Wait! You're running the wrong way.

01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:10.430
The castle's over there.

01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:28.360
Sit.

01:12:40.032 --> 01:12:43.840
Eat this darling, and you'll
get your freedom.

01:12:44.008 --> 01:12:45.340
Where is my father?

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:50.040
Royal loyal little girl,
pining for her papa?

01:12:50.430 --> 01:12:54.720
This is getting a little boring, so I need
you to take a bite, and I'll tell you.

01:12:54.850 --> 01:12:56.270
I won't let you win.

01:12:56.690 --> 01:13:00.150
You've torn apart my family,
and you will not get away with it, Regina.

01:13:01.190 --> 01:13:04.056
Ooh, I'm so scared, Snow.

01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:07.280
Very well. A different approach.

01:13:15.950 --> 01:13:16.950
- Merlin!
- No!

01:13:17.410 --> 01:13:19.960
Eat the apple, or watch him die.

01:13:20.130 --> 01:13:21.009
That's your choice.

01:13:21.033 --> 01:13:22.936
Don't do it. No!

01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:24.840
No!

01:13:26.299 --> 01:13:27.299
Red Shoes!

01:13:27.300 --> 01:13:29.550
Promise to me, you'll let him go.

01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:33.040
Oh absolutely.
When the third bell chimes,

01:13:33.220 --> 01:13:36.140
everything will be just
like it used to be.

01:13:36.270 --> 01:13:38.560
No! No no no.

01:13:40.770 --> 01:13:42.560
Save my papa for me.

01:13:53.039 --> 01:13:54.539
Red Shoes!

01:14:09.340 --> 01:14:13.970
A legendary handsome knight,
fearless rescuer of princesses.

01:14:14.100 --> 01:14:19.180
Sitting in a tree,
not getting K - I - S - I - N - G - D.

01:14:20.350 --> 01:14:22.016
Burn. I can't spell.

01:14:24.360 --> 01:14:25.836
You don't have to do this.

01:14:25.860 --> 01:14:27.940
Just take the shoes and let us go.

01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:31.150
I wish. They're made of pure magic apple.

01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:34.296
The fruit of temptation and want.
They feed on your desires

01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:38.790
Once they give you what you desire,
the bond is permanent.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.250
That's not true. She took
them off in the river.

01:14:41.330 --> 01:14:43.008
That doesn't make any sense.

01:14:43.032 --> 01:14:47.670
How could she possibly want to save you
more than she wanted to be beautiful?

01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:50.008
What did you do to her?

01:14:50.260 --> 01:14:52.180
Did you cast a spell?

01:14:54.300 --> 01:14:55.866
What's going to happen to her?

01:14:55.890 --> 01:15:00.826
Well, once she eats the apple, its magic
will turn her into a magic apple tree.

01:15:00.850 --> 01:15:03.940
The first bell, nothing really happens,
but very dramatic.

01:15:04.150 --> 01:15:06.456
The tree bears fruit,
and the second bell...

01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:08.690
Oh! Excitement mounts!

01:15:08.940 --> 01:15:10.900
The morning sun touches the fruit

01:15:11.056 --> 01:15:13.636
turning it into a new
pair of red shoes

01:15:13.660 --> 01:15:16.620
And number three, the circle of life!

01:15:16.990 --> 01:15:17.990
And then what?

01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:21.620
Regina will be the most
beautiful person in the kingdom.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:22.937
Forever.

01:15:22.961 --> 01:15:25.830
I don't care about her,
what about Snow White?

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:30.236
The tree withers and dies,
and so does Snow White.

01:15:30.260 --> 01:15:32.040
No!

01:15:32.170 --> 01:15:33.880
Yes!

01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:38.430
Oh, I'm rotten! I'm dying.

01:15:55.320 --> 01:15:58.160
Why don't you come back and play?

01:16:04.500 --> 01:16:05.870
Not so fast.

01:16:15.630 --> 01:16:16.760
It's gonna hurt.

01:16:20.430 --> 01:16:23.480
Oh yeah! Stretch it out.

01:16:35.079 --> 01:16:36.279
Uh-oh.

01:16:40.580 --> 01:16:41.740
Smoke! Smoke!

01:16:41.950 --> 01:16:43.926
We're here, bitch. Are you okay?

01:16:43.950 --> 01:16:45.410
Yeah.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
I never thought I'd say this,

01:16:48.710 --> 01:16:51.000
but I'm so glad to be chubby
and green again.

01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:55.008
Seven to one.
I like those odds.

01:16:55.220 --> 01:16:56.260
Let's go.

01:16:58.220 --> 01:17:00.220
We like those odds even better.

01:17:03.048 --> 01:17:04.810
Are you up to this, muchacho?

01:17:05.980 --> 01:17:08.350
You finally pulled out Excalibur.

01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:12.626
Oh, yes, yes. I did it.
That's exactly how it went down.

01:17:12.650 --> 01:17:14.900
Here you go Merlin.
You're gonna need these.

01:17:14.940 --> 01:17:15.940
Thanks.

01:17:21.660 --> 01:17:23.950
Here comes the sun.

01:17:24.410 --> 01:17:26.250
Now let's all get dwarfed.

01:17:30.170 --> 01:17:34.670
Ah, this is where your
fairy tale ends, trolls.

01:17:39.300 --> 01:17:40.300
You missed.

01:18:17.170 --> 01:18:18.920
Au revoir, mirror!

01:18:34.016 --> 01:18:35.270
Finally.

01:18:43.950 --> 01:18:46.660
It's a good day to break a curse.

01:18:48.330 --> 01:18:50.540
Eternal Beauty.

01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:04.760
I'm sorry

01:19:05.300 --> 01:19:06.640
Snow White.

01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:12.940
Ahhh!

01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:42.670
Extraordinary! No more carrots for me.

01:19:49.048 --> 01:19:50.025
Woah! We're back!

01:19:50.049 --> 01:19:51.100
Yippee!

01:20:01.530 --> 01:20:02.530
Papa?

01:20:12.660 --> 01:20:14.032
Snow White?

01:20:16.330 --> 01:20:17.420
Oh papa!

01:20:17.540 --> 01:20:18.540
Snow!

01:20:23.800 --> 01:20:24.800
Wait.

01:20:24.970 --> 01:20:26.220
Where's Merlin?

01:20:26.340 --> 01:20:28.008
I'm so sorry.

01:20:28.470 --> 01:20:32.430
He sacrificed himself to stop Regina.

01:20:32.890 --> 01:20:34.560
Merlin, no!

01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:39.150
Merlin!

01:21:39.670 --> 01:21:41.290
I thought you were gone.

01:21:42.130 --> 01:21:46.420
You're the most beautiful
woman in the world.

01:21:48.260 --> 01:21:50.760
With my eyes open

01:21:52.510 --> 01:21:53.970
or closed.

01:22:05.270 --> 01:22:06.270
No.

01:22:23.670 --> 01:22:25.500
I got Merlined.

01:22:50.700 --> 01:22:52.320
You're a prince, Merlin.

01:22:59.910 --> 01:23:02.580
Yeah, that Merlin.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:06.000
The one who's not really your type.

01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:12.340
I kind of liked the short
and green Merlin.

01:23:14.760 --> 01:23:17.310
But I'm still that Merlin inside.

01:23:18.390 --> 01:23:21.016
Yes, yes you are.

01:23:39.580 --> 01:23:41.200
Any idea who that girl is?

01:23:53.001 --> 01:23:55.201
¶ I'm feeling good today

01:23:56.402 --> 01:23:58.902
¶ Aint nothing standing in my way

01:23:58.903 --> 01:24:01.103
¶ I wouldn't change a thing

01:24:01.104 --> 01:24:04.604
¶ I must get hot walking in a dream

01:24:04.605 --> 01:24:08.105
¶ Everybody wants to stop and stare

01:24:08.106 --> 01:24:11.106
¶ People talk but I don't care

01:24:11.107 --> 01:24:14.607
¶ Everybody wants to stop and stare

01:24:14.608 --> 01:24:17.608
¶ People talk but I don't care

01:24:17.609 --> 01:24:20.609
¶ Don't matter what you think or see

01:24:20.610 --> 01:24:23.610
¶ There's no-one I would rather be

01:24:23.611 --> 01:24:26.611
¶ Take me as I am this is me

01:24:26.612 --> 01:24:29.612
¶ There's no-one I would rather be

01:24:30.613 --> 01:24:32.413
¶ It don't matter

01:24:33.414 --> 01:24:35.614
¶ It don't matter to me

01:24:36.515 --> 01:24:38.315
¶ It don't matter

01:24:38.316 --> 01:24:41.316
¶ Take me as I am this is me

01:24:41.317 --> 01:24:43.317
¶ I learned to let it go

01:24:44.418 --> 01:24:46.218
¶ 'Cause I'm comfortable

01:24:47.219 --> 01:24:49.019
¶ In my own skin

01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:52.520
¶ I learned to dance in the suits I'm in

01:24:52.521 --> 01:24:56.021
¶ Everybody wants to stop and stare

01:24:56.022 --> 01:24:59.022
¶ People talk but I don't care

01:24:59.023 --> 01:25:02.223
¶ Everybody wants to stop and stare

01:25:02.224 --> 01:25:05.224
¶ People talk but I don't care

01:25:05.225 --> 01:25:08.225
¶ Don't matter what you think or see

¶ I'm comfortable...

01:25:54.436 --> 01:25:55.636
Huh?

01:26:05.537 --> 01:26:07.737
Ooh. Not Again!
