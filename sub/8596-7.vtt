WEBVTT

00:01.086 --> 00:03.755
Previously on "The 100"...

00:04.130 --> 00:06.633
Her actions show us
a promise for a new future.

00:06.841 --> 00:09.719
Bellamy,
it's a trap!

00:15.725 --> 00:18.770
I've been looking for
something for a long time.

00:18.979 --> 00:21.147
I believe that version two
of my code is somewhere

00:21.356 --> 00:23.233
in the computer system
of the ark.

00:23.441 --> 00:24.693
Why did there need
to be a version two?

00:24.901 --> 00:25.860
Was there something
wrong with you?

00:26.069 --> 00:27.028
No. Nothing
was wrong with her.

00:27.237 --> 00:28.488
Listen to me, OK?

00:28.697 --> 00:30.198
I don't know anything more
about Clarke, all right?

00:30.407 --> 00:32.993
Forget about Clarke.
Tell me about this.

00:33.201 --> 00:35.245
I remain certain
that Becca went into space.

00:35.453 --> 00:36.955
Unfortunately,
it appears that she

00:37.163 --> 00:39.082
wasn't on any
of the 12 stations

00:39.290 --> 00:40.208
that made up
the ark.

00:40.417 --> 00:41.668
But there were
supposed to be 13.

00:41.876 --> 00:43.044
Oh! Aagh!

00:44.170 --> 00:46.339
- Tell me more.
- I wish I could.

00:46.548 --> 00:48.216
All I know is
that it happened,

00:48.425 --> 00:50.760
that it was
called Polaris.

00:50.969 --> 00:53.471
Aah! Stop! Aah!

01:44.272 --> 01:45.690
Now you've had time
to think,

01:45.899 --> 01:48.777
shall we continue our
conversation about this?

01:48.985 --> 01:50.570
I already told you
everything I know

01:50.779 --> 01:52.363
the first 10 times
you asked me.

01:52.572 --> 01:54.365
What you told me
doesn't make any sense.

01:54.574 --> 01:57.243
How did a sky person
come to be in possession

01:57.452 --> 01:59.829
of our most holy
symbol?

02:00.038 --> 02:02.957
Holy? It's a
corporate logo.

02:04.959 --> 02:06.961
Wrong.

02:07.170 --> 02:08.880
This is the sacred symbol
of the commander

02:09.089 --> 02:11.424
to whom I've
dedicated my life.

02:11.633 --> 02:13.635
Now, how did
you get it?

02:13.843 --> 02:17.555
Again, Jaha
gave it to me.

02:19.307 --> 02:21.392
This would be
chancellor Jaha.

02:21.601 --> 02:23.353
Yes. He told me
it was the key

02:23.561 --> 02:26.147
to the city of light
and that if I swallowed it,

02:26.356 --> 02:27.982
the woman in red
would take me there.

02:28.191 --> 02:29.567
The woman
who's not a woman.

02:29.776 --> 02:30.985
Yeah. That's right.

02:31.194 --> 02:32.362
She's a computer
program, but I get

02:32.570 --> 02:33.822
that's hard
for you to grasp,

02:34.030 --> 02:36.449
considering you pray
to garbage,

02:36.658 --> 02:38.535
no offense,
obviously.

02:41.996 --> 02:43.915
Tell me more
about this

02:44.124 --> 02:46.209
computer program
that ended the world.

02:46.417 --> 02:48.586
Come on. I don't have
any details, OK?

02:48.795 --> 02:49.629
On the ark,
they just told us

02:49.838 --> 02:53.007
it was countries,
politics.

02:53.216 --> 02:55.885
Big surprise,
they were wrong.

03:02.225 --> 03:04.561
Science log, day 128.

03:04.769 --> 03:09.065
The a.I. Basal control module
continues to malfunction.

03:11.901 --> 03:13.403
Twitching again.

03:13.611 --> 03:15.655
I thought I had that
under control.

03:15.864 --> 03:17.991
The neural interface is
the key to everything.

03:18.199 --> 03:19.576
If we don't crack that,
then we might as well

03:19.784 --> 03:22.120
go back to the Alie code
and start again.

03:22.328 --> 03:24.080
We can always
ask her.

03:25.623 --> 03:26.666
Becca, it's an emergency.

03:26.875 --> 03:28.459
I need to talk to you
right now.

03:28.668 --> 03:29.627
Speak
of the devil.

03:29.836 --> 03:32.046
Becca,
I need to talk to you.

03:32.255 --> 03:34.465
Becca, she got through
the black ice encryption...

03:34.674 --> 03:36.217
OK, Chris.
Slow down.

03:36.426 --> 03:38.678
I'm locking in
the signal.

03:38.887 --> 03:40.889
And now she's out
of the Faraday cage.

03:41.097 --> 03:42.682
It's Alie.
She got out.

03:42.891 --> 03:45.351
She's on the grid.
She's cracking systems.

03:45.560 --> 03:47.645
She just got
through portal security

03:47.854 --> 03:50.023
for Stratcom
in Omaha.

03:50.231 --> 03:51.441
What is she
doing?

03:51.649 --> 03:53.526
She's hacking
nuclear launch codes.

03:53.735 --> 03:55.862
Why?

03:56.070 --> 03:58.364
"Too many people."

03:58.573 --> 04:01.492
Send Alie's poison pill
virus through the web.

04:01.701 --> 04:03.620
Do it now.
Kill her.

04:03.828 --> 04:05.580
I did that
10 minutes ago.

04:05.788 --> 04:07.957
She's locked me
out of everything.

04:08.166 --> 04:09.667
Chris, get to
the lighthouse bunker.

04:09.876 --> 04:12.128
Do it now.

04:12.337 --> 04:15.632
Doctors, there's a
situation on the ground.

04:15.840 --> 04:18.760
27 ICBMs have been
launched from China.

04:18.968 --> 04:21.888
No one knows why,
but it's real.

04:22.096 --> 04:25.683
They're headed for
the United States.

04:27.644 --> 04:29.562
Open the window.

04:34.651 --> 04:37.237
I've told the crew to
contact their families.

04:37.445 --> 04:40.323
If there's anyone
you need to talk to--

04:49.332 --> 04:50.875
Commander, we
finally got a hold of your wife.

04:51.084 --> 04:53.461
I'm here.
Patch her through.

04:53.670 --> 04:55.004
- Cole?
- Emily?

04:55.213 --> 04:56.381
I'm here.

04:56.589 --> 04:57.840
Oh, thank God.
Is Sarah with you?

04:58.049 --> 04:59.259
She's here, too.

04:59.467 --> 05:00.885
Is it true, what they're
saying on the news?

05:01.094 --> 05:02.845
Yes. It's true.

05:03.054 --> 05:05.014
Hey, can you put her
on the phone with us?

05:05.223 --> 05:08.142
I want her to hear
my voice. Please.

05:08.351 --> 05:10.812
Yes.
Here she is.

05:11.020 --> 05:12.397
Daddy?

05:12.605 --> 05:13.898
Hey, baby girl.

05:14.107 --> 05:15.358
Poppy got me a bike.

05:15.566 --> 05:16.776
Can you teach me
how to ride it?

05:16.985 --> 05:18.027
Of course.

05:18.236 --> 05:19.362
I'll teach you to ride
it as soon as we--

05:22.073 --> 05:24.075
Signal lost.

05:35.461 --> 05:38.047
What have I done?

06:41.611 --> 06:44.364
We gather here
on this ascension day

06:44.572 --> 06:47.492
to honor the commanders
that came before me,

06:47.700 --> 06:50.411
those who live on within me

06:50.620 --> 06:53.790
as I will live on
within one of you.

07:03.716 --> 07:05.510
Titus, what is this?

07:05.718 --> 07:08.054
Something you
need to hear, Heda.

07:10.598 --> 07:12.975
Ahh...

07:13.184 --> 07:15.269
Mm!

07:15.478 --> 07:17.355
Octavia.

07:48.594 --> 07:52.890
What crimes?
What happened?

07:53.099 --> 07:55.268
Skaikru attacked
their village.

07:55.476 --> 07:58.604
Because their warriors
were lost when your people

07:58.813 --> 08:02.275
massacred the army we
had sent to protect you,

08:02.483 --> 08:06.028
their village
was defenseless.

08:22.628 --> 08:26.132
How dare you bring this
to me on ascension day?

08:26.340 --> 08:28.634
I did not bring
this here, Heda.

08:28.843 --> 08:30.595
You did.

08:30.803 --> 08:33.973
Against my advice,
you made Skaikru the 13th clan.

08:34.182 --> 08:37.810
They rejected this, murdering
hundreds of your people,

08:38.019 --> 08:40.021
and yet on the very
field where they died,

08:40.229 --> 08:42.148
you decided to
forgive the killers,

08:42.356 --> 08:44.358
but his provocation
is proof.

08:44.567 --> 08:46.652
Blood must not
have blood has failed.

08:46.861 --> 08:49.363
All that can stop
this now is war.

08:52.074 --> 08:53.576
Clarke?

08:53.784 --> 08:56.329
Clarke's opinion in this matter
is not exactly unbiased.

09:00.374 --> 09:01.459
Titus is right.

09:02.210 --> 09:04.212
I would do anything
to save my people.

09:04.420 --> 09:08.966
You know that,
but I know them.

09:09.175 --> 09:11.260
Not everyone agrees
with chancellor pike.

09:11.469 --> 09:13.346
Kane doesn't.
Octavia doesn't.

09:13.554 --> 09:15.264
Your people
did not vote for Kane.

09:15.473 --> 09:17.058
Some of them did.

09:17.266 --> 09:18.601
We need to give them
time to see that

09:18.809 --> 09:21.020
they made the wrong
choice and fix it.

09:21.229 --> 09:23.439
And you believe
your people

09:23.648 --> 09:26.984
will take him out
themselves.

09:27.193 --> 09:30.571
If they don't,
if instead they use this time

09:30.780 --> 09:35.117
to plan their next attack,
we must act now, Heda.

09:35.326 --> 09:38.454
Make an example
of the 13th clan.

09:38.663 --> 09:40.456
Show the other 12 what
happens when they defy you.

09:40.665 --> 09:42.250
You got them back when
you killed the ice queen,

09:42.458 --> 09:44.001
but the coalition
is still fragile.

09:44.210 --> 09:46.170
If you don't act now--

09:50.633 --> 09:53.719
Today I call upon the armies
of the 12 clans

09:53.928 --> 09:56.430
to march on Arkadia.

09:59.684 --> 10:03.563
Not to attack,
but to contain.

10:06.857 --> 10:09.402
We will blockade
the 13th clan.

10:09.610 --> 10:12.029
We will keep them from the lands
they wish to possess.

10:12.238 --> 10:14.824
We will give them time
to take out their leaders

10:15.032 --> 10:17.451
from within.

10:18.786 --> 10:20.788
Once they rise up
against them,

10:20.997 --> 10:24.792
then we will welcome them back
as one of us.

10:30.631 --> 10:33.551
You heard the commander.
Send riders.

10:33.759 --> 10:37.013
Tell your armies to set up
a buffer zone around Arkadia.

10:37.221 --> 10:41.392
5 Miles should be enough to keep
them away from our villages.

10:41.601 --> 10:43.519
What are
their orders, Heda?

10:51.027 --> 10:52.695
Any Skaikru caught
across the line

10:52.903 --> 10:54.614
will be subject
to a kill order.

10:56.824 --> 10:58.784
Heda,
I do not understand.

10:58.993 --> 11:00.911
How is this
vengeance?

11:01.120 --> 11:03.289
It is not vengeance,
my brother.

11:03.497 --> 11:04.749
It is justice.

11:04.957 --> 11:06.834
Skaikru killed
my sons

11:07.043 --> 11:09.503
and my brother
and my wife.

11:09.712 --> 11:11.380
If the spirit of the
commander will not

11:11.589 --> 11:13.758
protect us,
then what will?

11:13.966 --> 11:17.720
You mind yourself,
Semet.

11:21.724 --> 11:24.310
Rrgh!

11:24.518 --> 11:25.311
Agh!

11:25.519 --> 11:27.146
Huh!

11:42.995 --> 11:45.581
Blood must have blood.

11:56.509 --> 11:59.178
Uh! Uh! Uh!

12:03.307 --> 12:05.142
Uh!

12:13.651 --> 12:15.111
Uh!

12:26.497 --> 12:28.666
This will do. Uh!

12:35.548 --> 12:36.882
"Polis."

12:49.812 --> 12:52.273
Polaris.

13:39.153 --> 13:41.322
Step away from your
instruments right now.

13:41.530 --> 13:43.032
I own this space station,
commander.

13:43.240 --> 13:44.700
You don't
give me orders.

13:44.909 --> 13:45.993
I do now
that I know

13:46.202 --> 13:47.536
the nature of
your research.

13:50.247 --> 13:51.665
You told him?

13:51.874 --> 13:53.709
The people of the ark
deserve to know

13:53.918 --> 13:56.545
what we're working on
before we bring it on board.

13:56.754 --> 13:58.130
Today is unity day.

13:58.339 --> 13:59.548
Listen to your
assistant, doc.

13:59.757 --> 14:01.592
OK. No. Please just
stay out of this, commander.

14:01.801 --> 14:03.135
Stay out of this?

14:03.344 --> 14:04.970
For two years, I've done
everything humanly possible

14:05.179 --> 14:07.181
to keep this boat alive,
and now I find out

14:07.389 --> 14:09.058
that not only did
an artificial intelligence

14:09.266 --> 14:10.976
that you designed
end the world,

14:11.185 --> 14:13.479
but you're still
working on it.

14:13.687 --> 14:16.398
Listen to me, doctor,
and listen good.

14:16.607 --> 14:19.819
We're set to begin docking
maneuvers in two hours,

14:20.027 --> 14:21.862
13 space stations
becoming one,

14:22.071 --> 14:23.531
possibly the greatest
feat of engineering

14:23.739 --> 14:25.908
in human history,
all designed to ride out

14:26.116 --> 14:27.618
the nightmare
that you created.

14:27.827 --> 14:29.578
I understand the stakes,
commander.

14:29.787 --> 14:31.163
- Do you?
- Yes.

14:31.372 --> 14:32.790
Good. Then you'll
understand why

14:32.998 --> 14:35.251
there's no way in hell
I'm giving a potentially

14:35.459 --> 14:38.254
genocidal a.I. Access to
what's left of the human race.

14:38.462 --> 14:39.630
I agree with him.

14:39.839 --> 14:42.466
We can't join the ark
until that thing is--

14:42.675 --> 14:47.096
that thing
is what will save us.

14:47.304 --> 14:50.015
Alie 1
didn't understand

14:50.224 --> 14:51.559
what it meant
to be human, yes,

14:51.767 --> 14:53.978
but Alie 2 will.

14:54.186 --> 14:56.272
It's designed to
interface with humanity

14:56.480 --> 14:58.148
on a biological level.

14:58.357 --> 15:00.192
It will understand
the value of life

15:00.401 --> 15:03.779
by coexisting
with us.

15:03.988 --> 15:07.116
OK, commander.
Let me ask you this.

15:07.324 --> 15:09.368
Do you honestly believe
that there are enough

15:09.577 --> 15:12.162
smart people
on these 13 stations

15:12.371 --> 15:15.374
to save us, that their
calculations are right,

15:15.583 --> 15:18.878
that there is enough air
to last two centuries,

15:19.086 --> 15:20.796
enough food?

15:21.005 --> 15:23.465
Alie 2 will run all
the possibilities.

15:23.674 --> 15:26.677
She'll see the mistakes
before we ever make them.

15:26.886 --> 15:28.470
It will know
our wants and needs

15:28.679 --> 15:32.641
because they're its
wants and needs.

15:32.850 --> 15:35.895
The code is in
that crystal matrix.

15:36.103 --> 15:37.271
No. No. No.

15:37.479 --> 15:39.982
- Hey--
- please. Please.

15:40.190 --> 15:43.819
Killing it
is killing us.

15:45.571 --> 15:47.114
We will need
the prototypes

15:47.323 --> 15:49.241
and the system's
hard drives, too.

15:49.450 --> 15:51.243
Gather it up.

15:51.452 --> 15:54.705
I'll be right back with
something to float it in.

15:58.417 --> 16:00.669
Get the hell out
of my lab.

16:00.878 --> 16:01.921
Becca, come on.

16:02.129 --> 16:04.173
Get out!

16:05.466 --> 16:08.177
Joining the ark
is our last hope.

16:08.385 --> 16:11.096
You can't stop this.

16:11.305 --> 16:15.017
Listen, Becca.
Becca, what are you doing?

16:15.225 --> 16:16.268
Security protocol
initiated.

16:16.477 --> 16:18.103
Door sealed.

16:18.312 --> 16:20.189
Override clearance
activated.

16:38.457 --> 16:40.918
No wonder you
wanted to stay.

16:41.126 --> 16:44.797
Stop. You know
why I'm here.

16:49.093 --> 16:51.095
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, fine.

16:51.303 --> 16:53.639
I saw Indra
in the crowd.

16:53.847 --> 16:55.474
Why wasn't she
with Lexa?

16:55.683 --> 16:58.644
Indra's not doing
so well, Octavia.

16:58.852 --> 17:01.146
We can't deal
with that right now.

17:01.355 --> 17:04.316
OK, so what
do we do?

17:05.776 --> 17:07.152
I have to talk
to Lexa.

17:07.361 --> 17:08.779
You just did that
and came out

17:08.988 --> 17:11.240
with a kill order
on all of us.

17:11.448 --> 17:14.451
That's the second time
that she left us all to die.

17:14.660 --> 17:19.415
The 12 clans want a war.
You know that.

17:19.623 --> 17:21.083
Lexa's just trying
not to wipe us out.

17:21.291 --> 17:24.294
Why am I not surprised that
you're still defending her?

17:24.503 --> 17:26.630
I'll see
what I can do.

17:26.839 --> 17:28.173
Stay here.

17:33.637 --> 17:36.348
Yeah, right.

17:48.902 --> 17:51.113
Someone tried
to kill you today.

17:51.321 --> 17:53.407
How are you
this calm?

17:56.243 --> 17:58.495
You're angry about
the kill order.

17:59.830 --> 18:01.874
Yes.

18:02.082 --> 18:05.044
How else would you have me
enforce a blockade?

18:07.921 --> 18:10.466
So when do we
have to leave?

18:15.679 --> 18:17.598
We may be
drawing a line,

18:17.806 --> 18:21.101
but who's to say
you can't choose

18:21.310 --> 18:23.479
to stay on this
side of it?

18:27.816 --> 18:30.069
I know someone
who might.

18:36.784 --> 18:38.202
Wanheda,

18:38.410 --> 18:40.037
blockade goes
into effect at dawn.

18:40.245 --> 18:41.830
I've made
arrangements for you

18:42.039 --> 18:43.582
to take one of
our fastest horses.

18:43.791 --> 18:45.250
Thank you.

18:45.459 --> 18:48.128
Actually, I've asked Clarke
to stay in Polis as my guest.

18:50.005 --> 18:52.257
Clarke, will you
excuse us?

19:07.439 --> 19:11.151
On this sacred day,
I beg you

19:11.360 --> 19:13.570
to remember
my teachings.

19:16.281 --> 19:19.284
Love is weakness.

19:19.493 --> 19:21.745
To be commander
is to be alone.

19:21.954 --> 19:23.205
I will not
hear this again.

19:23.413 --> 19:24.957
Yes, you will.

19:25.165 --> 19:27.793
Your feelings for Clarke
put both of you in danger.

19:29.128 --> 19:32.297
Your kill order must
be fully enforced.

19:32.506 --> 19:34.591
If you care for Clarke,
you will send her home.

19:34.800 --> 19:37.719
It is the only way
that she will be safe.

19:37.928 --> 19:40.013
Don't make her pay
the price for your mistakes

19:40.222 --> 19:42.391
as Costia did.

19:44.184 --> 19:46.645
My mistakes?

19:46.854 --> 19:49.606
Azgeda cut off
Costia's head

19:49.815 --> 19:52.568
and delivered it
to my bed,

19:52.776 --> 19:55.821
and still I let them
into my alliance.

19:56.029 --> 19:58.699
I'm more than capable
of separating feelings

19:58.907 --> 20:00.909
from duty.

20:02.536 --> 20:05.831
I'm sorry, Lexa.
I didn't mean to offend you.

20:06.039 --> 20:07.374
Yes, you did...

20:09.168 --> 20:11.795
But you also
mean well,

20:12.004 --> 20:15.299
and I know that,
teacher.

20:17.885 --> 20:20.679
May I make arrangements
for Clarke's departure?

20:20.888 --> 20:23.724
That's up to Clarke.

20:23.932 --> 20:26.602
I know where
you stand, Titus.

20:50.751 --> 20:53.003
You waste your time.

20:59.676 --> 21:01.595
Go away.

21:03.055 --> 21:05.891
I need the woman
I served as second.

21:06.099 --> 21:08.227
I need the warrior who
taught me to be who I am.

21:08.435 --> 21:11.772
I said, get out
of here, sky girl.

21:11.980 --> 21:13.065
Indra, please.

21:13.273 --> 21:14.650
I'm going back
to fight my own people,

21:14.858 --> 21:17.361
the people who
did this to you.

21:17.569 --> 21:19.029
I will fight my own
brother if I have to,

21:19.238 --> 21:21.406
but I can't
do it alone.

21:21.615 --> 21:24.284
One word from you,
and Trikru will--

21:26.411 --> 21:28.997
aah! You see?

21:29.206 --> 21:31.917
Even someone as slow
and as weak as you

21:32.125 --> 21:35.087
can put me
on my back.

21:35.295 --> 21:38.257
I should have died
on that field.

21:38.465 --> 21:40.759
We all die.

21:40.968 --> 21:42.678
You can either
do that here

21:42.886 --> 21:44.805
feeling sorry
for yourself

21:45.013 --> 21:48.767
or you come back with me
and get your revenge.

21:52.938 --> 21:54.815
The choice is yours.

22:20.549 --> 22:22.634
Rrgh!

22:36.398 --> 22:39.067
Ugh...

22:39.276 --> 22:42.612
No, no.
Hey, hey, listen.

22:42.821 --> 22:43.989
I'll tell you what
you want to know

22:44.197 --> 22:46.241
about the chip, OK,
please, but you think

22:46.450 --> 22:48.076
it has something to do
with Polaris, right?

22:48.285 --> 22:50.037
It's the space station
it came down from.

22:50.245 --> 22:51.288
I could show you.

22:52.581 --> 22:55.709
Please. I could
show you. Please

23:15.479 --> 23:17.147
I'm guessing you
think it's "Polis"

23:17.356 --> 23:19.024
because the "a"
and the "r,"

23:19.232 --> 23:20.442
they burned off
during re-entry.

23:20.650 --> 23:23.153
You see? OK.
You see that?

23:25.864 --> 23:29.201
All I see is a man who'd
say anything not to die.

23:29.409 --> 23:32.496
That may be true,
but so is this.

23:32.704 --> 23:35.123
Polaris, that's part
of our story, too.

23:35.332 --> 23:37.334
It was our
13th station.

23:37.542 --> 23:40.837
My faith has got nothing
to do with yours.

23:41.046 --> 23:45.008
Trust me, I have
no faith, but look.

23:45.217 --> 23:47.636
I can prove it to you.

23:50.055 --> 23:53.975
The end of the world,
the mushroom cloud.

23:54.184 --> 23:55.519
It's why we had
to stay in space.

23:55.727 --> 23:57.854
You guys call us
Skaikru, right?

23:58.063 --> 23:59.689
That's why.

24:01.608 --> 24:03.276
Polaris, as the story
goes, was the only

24:03.485 --> 24:05.278
station that
wouldn't join Skaikru,

24:05.487 --> 24:07.114
so they blew it up.

24:07.322 --> 24:10.492
That's a novel concept.
Continue.

24:10.700 --> 24:13.245
Anyway, I'm thinking
that maybe this person,

24:13.453 --> 24:15.622
she somehow got out
in time, right,

24:15.831 --> 24:17.124
because--look--
here she is again.

24:17.332 --> 24:19.000
She's there surrounded
by all those--

24:19.209 --> 24:20.377
I don't know.

24:20.585 --> 24:21.837
Uh, I don't really know
what those are.

24:22.045 --> 24:23.588
The first Natblida.

24:23.797 --> 24:26.091
Natblidas, and
there--there she is,

24:26.299 --> 24:28.051
this woman who fell
out of the sky, right?

24:28.260 --> 24:31.430
I mean, that's--
that's just like us.

24:31.638 --> 24:34.224
It's nothing
like you.

24:44.192 --> 24:47.654
Becca,
I need you to listen to me.

24:49.156 --> 24:50.657
I just received
an emergency message

24:50.866 --> 24:53.368
from the American station.

24:53.577 --> 24:55.328
Both the Russian and Chinese
are threatening

24:55.537 --> 24:57.998
to stop docking maneuvers
because we have.

25:00.876 --> 25:03.587
Becca,
are you listening to me?

25:08.508 --> 25:11.178
Alpha station
is threatening to open fire

25:11.386 --> 25:14.639
if we don't get back in line
in the next 60 seconds.

25:14.848 --> 25:17.225
They will make
an example of us.

25:17.434 --> 25:19.978
Commander, if you
don't want them to fire,

25:20.187 --> 25:21.855
then begin
the maneuvers.

25:22.063 --> 25:23.398
We've been through this.

25:23.607 --> 25:24.983
The moment we dock,
your a.I.

25:25.192 --> 25:26.151
Infects the other
12 stations.

25:26.359 --> 25:28.153
That's not
going to happen.

25:28.361 --> 25:30.989
One way or another,
that thing dies today.

25:31.198 --> 25:33.200
Now open the damn door
so we can float

25:33.408 --> 25:36.912
this thing and get on
with saving the human race.

25:37.120 --> 25:39.498
I am saving
the human race.

25:39.706 --> 25:40.874
Woman, on intercom:
Becca, please.

25:41.082 --> 25:42.167
What are you doing?

25:42.375 --> 25:45.545
I know you want penance
for what Alie did,

25:45.754 --> 25:48.173
but this is not
the way to get it.

25:48.381 --> 25:50.842
You're right.

25:51.051 --> 25:54.137
I do have a lot
to make up for.

25:55.847 --> 25:57.641
Let me save us.

25:57.849 --> 25:59.559
Man, on speaker:
Polaris, this is Alpha station.

25:59.768 --> 26:02.562
Last warning--
you have 20 seconds to comply,

26:02.771 --> 26:04.564
or you will be
fired upon.

26:04.773 --> 26:08.360
Tell Commander McAdams
to start the maneuvers.

26:08.568 --> 26:10.820
This is his call...

26:12.322 --> 26:13.865
Not mine.

26:14.074 --> 26:16.576
10 seconds,
Polaris. Begin those maneuvers.

26:16.785 --> 26:18.828
Becca, you already have the
blood of billions on your hands.

26:19.037 --> 26:22.541
Is it worth risking the rest of
us just to prove you're right?

26:22.749 --> 26:25.252
I'm sorry.

26:25.460 --> 26:28.296
This is not
what I wanted.

26:28.505 --> 26:31.633
6, 5...

26:31.841 --> 26:32.717
Becca, what
are you doing?

26:32.926 --> 26:35.554
- 4...
- She's taking the pod.

26:35.762 --> 26:37.514
As soon as it's away,
initiate maneuvers.

26:37.722 --> 26:39.266
2...

26:39.474 --> 26:40.767
Man, on intercom:
The pod's away, sir.

26:40.976 --> 26:42.018
Alpha station,
this is Polaris.

26:42.227 --> 26:43.353
We're commencing
docking maneuvers.

26:43.562 --> 26:44.771
Man, on speaker:
Negative, Polaris.

26:44.980 --> 26:46.356
If we're gonna
survive up here,

26:46.565 --> 26:48.441
extreme measures
will be required.

26:48.650 --> 26:51.319
Let this be a lesson
to all federation stations.

26:52.445 --> 26:54.906
God rest your souls.

26:55.115 --> 26:56.950
May God help ours.

27:27.230 --> 27:30.066
She told you you
can stay, didn't she?

27:31.610 --> 27:34.112
What did you say?

27:34.321 --> 27:36.489
Nothing.

27:36.698 --> 27:38.074
Clarke, we both
know that pike

27:38.283 --> 27:40.452
won't obey
the blockade.

27:40.660 --> 27:41.870
We need to stop him
before more

27:42.078 --> 27:43.997
of our people
get killed.

27:44.205 --> 27:45.582
What if I can do
more for them

27:45.790 --> 27:46.791
by just
staying here?

27:47.000 --> 27:49.377
You can't, Clarke.

27:49.586 --> 27:51.504
We don't have
time for this.

27:56.426 --> 28:00.513
Look. We need you.

28:02.390 --> 28:05.727
The kill order goes
into effect at dawn.

28:05.935 --> 28:10.357
You have an hour
to say your good-byes.

28:19.449 --> 28:22.369
If you're not there,

28:22.577 --> 28:26.289
you're not the person
I thought you were.

28:51.356 --> 28:53.733
When do you leave?

28:55.944 --> 28:57.487
Now.

29:04.411 --> 29:07.747
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

29:07.956 --> 29:10.875
You have to go back.
They're your people.

29:12.794 --> 29:14.003
That's why I--

29:17.924 --> 29:20.051
that's why
you're you.

29:24.764 --> 29:26.683
Maybe someday
you and I will owe

29:26.891 --> 29:28.810
nothing more
to our people.

29:32.230 --> 29:34.065
I hope so.

29:42.741 --> 29:45.493
May we meet again.

30:44.052 --> 30:45.678
If Octavia and I
are gonna get

30:45.887 --> 30:47.305
behind the blockade
by dawn--

30:47.514 --> 30:49.432
shh...

30:56.397 --> 30:59.317
This is beautiful.

30:59.526 --> 31:03.029
I got it on
my ascension day,

31:03.238 --> 31:06.366
a circle for every
nightblida that died

31:06.574 --> 31:08.576
when the commander
chose me.

31:08.785 --> 31:10.870
7 circles.

31:11.079 --> 31:12.247
I thought you said
there were

31:12.455 --> 31:14.207
9 novitiates
at your conclave.

31:14.415 --> 31:16.751
There were.

31:16.960 --> 31:20.171
What happened
to number 8?

31:25.885 --> 31:30.223
Can we talk about
something else?

31:30.431 --> 31:33.434
We don't have
to talk at all.

31:57.542 --> 31:58.835
Murphy?

32:01.838 --> 32:05.300
He's alive.

32:07.176 --> 32:09.429
What did you do
to my friend?

32:09.637 --> 32:11.139
Your friend was
caught stealing

32:11.347 --> 32:13.474
from people on their way
to the Polis market.

32:13.683 --> 32:15.268
Hey,
you're OK.

32:15.476 --> 32:17.353
Please don't do that.

32:21.941 --> 32:23.651
Titus,
what is this about?

32:23.860 --> 32:25.987
I'm sorry it had to come
to this, Clarke.

32:26.195 --> 32:27.530
Truly I am.

32:27.739 --> 32:30.241
Look. I'm leaving right now.
Octavia's waiting for me.

32:30.450 --> 32:32.201
Just let me take Murphy,
and we'll go.

32:32.410 --> 32:34.037
Wish I could.

32:34.245 --> 32:35.955
Lexa will never
execute her duty

32:36.164 --> 32:37.248
while you live.

32:37.457 --> 32:39.125
Titus, think.
She's gonna know it was you.

32:39.334 --> 32:41.169
She'll think
it was him,

32:41.377 --> 32:42.962
Skaikru weapon
in the hands

32:43.171 --> 32:44.505
of a Skaikru thief.

32:44.714 --> 32:47.300
She might even be angry
enough to declare war!

32:53.389 --> 32:54.557
- Huh!
- Lexa.

33:00.647 --> 33:01.522
Heda...

33:04.943 --> 33:06.611
No. No.

33:10.198 --> 33:11.449
Help me get her
to the bed.

33:15.578 --> 33:17.997
What have I done?

33:18.206 --> 33:20.750
I need something
to stop the bleeding.

33:20.959 --> 33:22.585
You'll be OK.
Just lie still, OK?

33:22.794 --> 33:23.753
Lie still.

33:25.630 --> 33:27.382
Don't be afraid.

33:27.590 --> 33:31.177
You're gonna be fine.
Just stay still.

33:50.863 --> 33:53.449
She's losing
too much blood.

33:55.535 --> 33:57.954
Stay with me.

34:05.253 --> 34:07.088
What the hell is that?

34:07.296 --> 34:10.675
Titus, what
are you doing?

34:15.054 --> 34:18.725
I will fix you.
Just stay with me.

34:18.933 --> 34:21.227
Oh, no.
Get away from her.

34:24.856 --> 34:27.191
Forgive me, Heda.

34:58.056 --> 35:01.851
Hey, Heda, don't
you dare give up.

35:02.060 --> 35:04.729
I'm not.

35:04.937 --> 35:07.690
My spirit
will live on.

35:07.899 --> 35:11.527
No. I'm not
letting you die.

35:13.488 --> 35:15.656
There's nothing
you can do now.

35:17.867 --> 35:20.787
The next commander
will protect you.

35:20.995 --> 35:24.665
I don't want
the next commander.

35:28.211 --> 35:30.254
I want you.

35:48.397 --> 35:50.650
Okteivia
kom Skaikru.

36:16.467 --> 36:18.553
I'm ready, Heda.

36:32.567 --> 36:34.193
Clarke...

36:34.402 --> 36:35.987
I'm here.

36:41.909 --> 36:45.204
No. No.
I won't accept that.

36:47.748 --> 36:50.126
You were right,
Clarke.

36:53.254 --> 36:56.507
Life is about more
than just surviving.

36:56.716 --> 36:58.467
Oh...

37:10.062 --> 37:12.690
In peace may you
leave the shore.

37:16.235 --> 37:19.197
In love may you find
the next.

37:22.366 --> 37:25.703
Safe passage
on your travels...

37:27.246 --> 37:30.625
Until our final journey
on the ground.

37:30.833 --> 37:33.753
May we meet again.

37:57.860 --> 37:59.320
Ohh...

38:15.628 --> 38:19.048
I must complete
the ritual.

38:20.466 --> 38:22.176
Please.

38:22.385 --> 38:26.430
The commander's spirit
must be passed on.

38:26.639 --> 38:29.517
This is my purpose.

38:29.725 --> 38:33.479
You must allow me
to complete the task.

38:33.688 --> 38:35.856
It is what
the commander wanted.

38:39.443 --> 38:40.444
Come on. We
should go. OK?

38:40.653 --> 38:41.529
No.

38:57.837 --> 38:59.797
What are
you doing?

39:06.345 --> 39:07.972
The sacred symbol.

39:20.401 --> 39:24.030
Suit breach.
Suit breach.

39:24.238 --> 39:30.828
Suit breach. Suit breach.
Suit breach.

39:31.037 --> 39:33.456
Radiation level--critical.

39:33.664 --> 39:36.250
Radiation level--
critical.

39:59.732 --> 40:02.068
I'm here to help.

40:18.626 --> 40:20.294
What are you doing?

40:30.346 --> 40:34.266
Oh, my God.

40:34.475 --> 40:35.976
What the hell?

40:54.120 --> 40:55.704
What is that?

41:00.501 --> 41:02.837
It's an a.I.

41:03.045 --> 41:04.463
Wrong.

41:04.672 --> 41:06.590
It's the spirit
of the commander.

41:39.206 --> 41:42.585
May her spirit choose wisely.
