00:36.119 --> 00:38.539
[Rm]

01:03.605 --> 01:05.107
[Crowd chattering]

01:09.361 --> 01:11.441
Bob [over radio]:
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

01:11.572 --> 01:14.366
This is Bob Walker
speaking from Dallas love field...

01:14.533 --> 01:17.119
Where a large crowd has gathered
to await the appearance...

01:17.286 --> 01:20.247
Of president and Mrs.
John Fitzgerald Kennedy...

01:20.414 --> 01:23.792
Who have arrived from
carswell air force base in fort worth.

01:23.959 --> 01:26.920
Woman:
Lyndon, stop looking at that. Honestly.

01:28.338 --> 01:31.633
Mr. Vice president, we'll be in
the third car, the gray Lincoln.

01:32.843 --> 01:34.803
What's the word on yarborough?

01:34.970 --> 01:37.306
The president told the senator
he rides with you...

01:37.472 --> 01:39.808
Or he could walk
through downtown Dallas.

01:39.975 --> 01:43.478
Oh, isn't that sweet? Thank you, honey.

01:43.645 --> 01:46.023
Bob: Yes. Yes, it is the first lady.
Woman: Jackie!

01:46.940 --> 01:49.192
[Crowd cheering]

01:50.694 --> 01:53.572
The youthful Mrs. Kennedy
looking beautiful in her pillbox hat...

01:53.739 --> 01:56.408
And matching pink outfit.

01:58.535 --> 02:00.412
Mrs. Kennedy is followed
by the president...

02:00.579 --> 02:02.956
- Hello. You look lovely.
- Of the United States.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.291
Thank you so much.

02:04.458 --> 02:06.752
- Hi, Jackie.
- Hi, lady bird. It's good to see you.

02:06.918 --> 02:08.336
- Mr. President.
- Lyndon.

02:08.502 --> 02:10.422
- How are you?
- Good.

02:10.589 --> 02:12.424
Mrs. Johnson. Lovely as always.

02:12.591 --> 02:14.051
- Nellie: Lyndon.
- Hi, Nellie.

02:14.217 --> 02:17.471
Followed by Texas senator
Ralph yarborough.

02:17.638 --> 02:18.722
Good morning to you.

02:21.099 --> 02:22.899
Man:
This will be your vehicle, Mr. President.

02:23.060 --> 02:26.021
Bob: The crowd is jockeying
for a better look at the president.

02:26.772 --> 02:29.358
Wait, no. The president has
walked past the motorcade...

02:29.524 --> 02:32.778
And he's making his way
towards the crowd.

02:34.196 --> 02:36.490
-How are you? Jackie: Hello.

02:36.657 --> 02:39.159
- Shaking hands with people.
- John: Thanks for coming out.

02:39.326 --> 02:41.203
- Thank you.
- Some have cameras...

02:41.370 --> 02:44.289
To capture this historic moment.
Jackie: Thank you.

02:44.456 --> 02:47.042
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- Real pleasure.

02:47.209 --> 02:50.879
They didn't expect to be shaking hands
with the president of the United States.

02:51.046 --> 02:55.425
This is quite a thrill for the people
who have waited here all morning.

02:55.592 --> 02:58.637
And once the motorcade departs,
it will head through the city...

02:58.804 --> 03:02.099
Where crowds are waiting for a view
of their president and his wife.

03:02.265 --> 03:04.385
- Lady bird: Thank you.
- Thousands will be on hand...

03:04.434 --> 03:07.813
For that motorcade, which
will move through downtown Dallas.

03:07.979 --> 03:10.816
Don't you just love Texas?

03:11.525 --> 03:14.027
Is there anywhere else you'd rather be?

03:15.904 --> 03:17.197
[Sighs]

03:21.535 --> 03:23.370
Walter:
This is regarding the farm bill

03:23.537 --> 03:26.123
we wanna vote in less than an hour.

03:26.289 --> 03:28.649
Get back to the leader.
Tell him people are still undecided.

03:28.792 --> 03:31.044
We wanna push this through
in the next half hour.

03:31.211 --> 03:34.423
Because I'm not general custer,
and this ain't little fucking bighorn.

03:34.589 --> 03:36.091
So if you have any objections...

03:36.258 --> 03:39.845
Tell me now before I head to the floor
of the United States senate.

03:40.011 --> 03:42.139
We got Cannon. Senator yarborough.

03:42.305 --> 03:44.725
- I'll be right with you.
- Juanita: Senator Mansfield, sir.

03:44.891 --> 03:48.270
- Mike. What's the number?
- About 48.

03:49.020 --> 03:51.732
"About 48" is not a number.

03:51.898 --> 03:53.817
Closest approximation I could get.

03:54.401 --> 03:57.821
Mike, I want you to imagine...

03:57.988 --> 04:01.366
Putting your little 2-inch pecker
on the edge of this table.

04:01.533 --> 04:03.994
Now, I grab a hatchet, and I tell you...

04:04.161 --> 04:07.831
That I'm gonna swing it down
about 2 inches from the edge.

04:07.998 --> 04:09.541
- Would you be nervous?
- Mm-hm.

04:09.708 --> 04:13.920
Well, that's how I feel when you tell me
that the count is "about 48."

04:14.087 --> 04:16.714
Now, what good is a whip
that doesn't know how to count?

04:16.882 --> 04:20.218
Go back out there
and get me an actual number!

04:20.385 --> 04:21.553
Juanita, dear?

04:21.720 --> 04:23.560
- Juanita: Yes, sir?
- Call dirksen's office...

04:23.597 --> 04:27.392
And tell him I'd like to speak
to the senator at his earliest convenience.

04:27.559 --> 04:30.771
- Yes, sir.
- George, get my tailor on the phone.

04:31.313 --> 04:32.731
Who is Mike Taylor?

04:32.898 --> 04:36.651
Who...? No, not "Mike Taylor." My tailor.

04:36.818 --> 04:40.447
The guy who makes my fucking clothes.
Get him on the phone now.

04:40.989 --> 04:42.574
- Senator yarborough.
- Mr. Leader...

04:42.741 --> 04:44.785
- I still don't take a drink.
- No?

04:44.951 --> 04:49.414
Now if you've called me in here to ask me
about my vote on the farm bill...

04:49.581 --> 04:53.001
I should tell you I have not changed
my position in the slightest.

04:53.168 --> 04:54.753
No problem. No problem at all.

04:55.629 --> 04:58.340
But, listen, while I got you here,
there is one question...

04:58.507 --> 05:00.550
I've been meaning to ask you.

05:00.717 --> 05:02.719
Have you got shit for brains?

05:03.553 --> 05:06.056
What the hell is your problem
with this farm bill?

05:06.223 --> 05:09.476
We should be doing a heck of a lot more
for the people who have less.

05:10.018 --> 05:14.981
The only thing more irritating
than a liberal is a liberal from Texas.

05:15.148 --> 05:16.388
[Whispers] The senator is here.

05:16.525 --> 05:19.277
- [Whispers] Bring him in.
- What my constituents want is...

05:19.444 --> 05:21.725
[In normal voice]
Your constituents are my constituents...

05:22.072 --> 05:26.076
And just because after three failed
attempts at the governor's mansion...

05:26.243 --> 05:28.829
You finally managed
to win an election...

05:28.995 --> 05:32.165
Hardly makes you an expert
on Texas voters.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.543
- Juanita: Sir?
- Don't tell me what they want.

05:34.709 --> 05:36.545
Senator dirksen is on the phone.

05:36.711 --> 05:38.380
I've got your tailor as well.

05:38.547 --> 05:42.175
You realize that juanita managed to get
the minority leader of the senate...

05:42.342 --> 05:45.554
Quicker than you could locate
a man who sews for a living?

05:45.720 --> 05:47.514
Hello, Everett, this is lyndon.

05:47.681 --> 05:52.352
We wanna bring this thing to the floor,
but can we do it without our two parties...

05:52.519 --> 05:56.398
Nipping at each other
like a pack of rabid dogs?

05:59.109 --> 06:02.863
Well, much appreciated,
as always, senator.

06:03.029 --> 06:04.197
-Juanita? Juanita: Yes, sir?

06:04.364 --> 06:06.449
Send dirksen a box of havanas.

06:06.616 --> 06:10.161
Walter, get ready to move on it.
You know, this could be your lucky day.

06:10.328 --> 06:13.039
You might be able to vote
your conscience on the farm bill.

06:13.206 --> 06:16.126
I like to think that is the only way
that I ever vote.

06:16.501 --> 06:18.920
Spoken like a true one-term senator.

06:19.796 --> 06:22.340
Means why haven't you
endorsed me for president?

06:22.883 --> 06:24.050
You haven't announced.

06:24.217 --> 06:25.468
Beside the point.

06:25.635 --> 06:28.430
- I like to hope that...
- You like Kennedy.

06:30.015 --> 06:33.393
Senator Kennedy and I,
we share many principles.

06:33.560 --> 06:37.314
You know, you got your show horses
and your workhorses.

06:37.480 --> 06:40.442
Now, Kennedy's a show horse:
Easy on the eyes...

06:40.609 --> 06:44.696
But when you need your field plowed,
he won't leave the barn.

06:44.863 --> 06:46.340
Ihearyou,
but what is most important...

06:46.364 --> 06:47.365
[Phone rings]

06:47.574 --> 06:49.075
- To me...
- Hold that thought.

06:49.242 --> 06:51.077
Hello there, this is lyndon Johnson.

06:51.244 --> 06:55.165
Now, you all made me
some real lightweight slacks...

06:55.332 --> 06:57.459
About three, four months ago.

06:57.626 --> 07:02.505
Kind of a light brown and light green.
Rather, soft green and soft brown.

07:02.672 --> 07:05.592
Like powder on a lady's...

07:05.967 --> 07:09.179
Face, and now,
I'm what they call "well-endowed"...

07:09.346 --> 07:11.723
So you give me
the average man's pants...

07:11.890 --> 07:16.895
I get all bunched up,
you know, like riding a wire fence.

07:17.062 --> 07:20.774
So give me another couple of inches
from where my nuts hang down...

07:20.941 --> 07:24.694
Round to the back of my bunghole.

07:24.861 --> 07:26.947
All right. Thank you very much.

07:28.490 --> 07:31.409
- You were saying?
- What is important to me...

07:31.576 --> 07:34.871
- Sir, that just put us over the top.
- Call for unanimous consent.

07:35.038 --> 07:37.082
Show horses, workhorses.

07:37.248 --> 07:39.125
You only get one.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.503
Go vote your conscience.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.217
[Rm]

07:47.425 --> 07:49.427
[People cheering]

07:54.099 --> 07:55.725
Nice of you to join us.

07:55.892 --> 07:59.604
Well, I heard there was a seat available.

08:00.897 --> 08:02.857
Bob: And as the motorcade makes
its departure...

08:03.024 --> 08:06.277
The presidential car is followed
by the secret service vehicle...

08:06.444 --> 08:09.739
Which is followed by vice president
and Mrs. Johnson.

08:11.700 --> 08:13.159
Oh. Heh.

08:13.326 --> 08:15.996
No, I'm... I'm perfectly fine.

08:16.705 --> 08:19.457
Guessing you Kennedys don't do
a lot of deer hunting.

08:19.624 --> 08:23.586
Well, when Kennedys fire weapons,
it's usually at Nazis.

08:23.753 --> 08:26.756
Lot of Nazis in hyannis port?

08:28.466 --> 08:30.719
We need to know if you're running.

08:31.386 --> 08:35.056
Quite comfortable in my post
as majority leader.

08:35.222 --> 08:37.851
Then perhaps you'd consider
endorsing my brother?

08:38.018 --> 08:41.312
I'll endorse whoever wins
our party's nomination.

08:41.479 --> 08:44.190
And there's no chance
that'll be you, correct?

08:44.357 --> 08:46.818
How many different ways
you want me to answer that?

08:46.985 --> 08:48.903
One would suffice.

08:49.279 --> 08:53.908
I have zero intention
of running for president.

08:55.160 --> 08:59.205
Johnson: I wanna know
why you're putting these signs up.

09:00.081 --> 09:05.628
For starters, Johnson has not said
that he's running for president.

09:06.379 --> 09:09.424
The reason I know is
because I'm fucking him!

09:11.301 --> 09:14.471
No, I'm not fucking him, I am him!

09:15.764 --> 09:18.244
Newscaster [on TV]:
His victory today was bolstered, in part...

09:18.391 --> 09:21.478
By the large catholic presence
in Wisconsin.

09:21.644 --> 09:24.856
- Up next, will be Illinois, New Jersey...
- What?

09:25.023 --> 09:27.025
Sir, I think it's time you announce.

09:27.192 --> 09:30.111
The next real test for Mr. Kennedy
will be in West Virginia...

09:30.278 --> 09:31.863
I haven't made up my mind yet.

09:32.030 --> 09:34.032
Connally:
Then tell me why I came all the way...

09:34.199 --> 09:36.910
From Texas to run a campaign
that doesn't have a candidate?

09:37.077 --> 09:40.371
Well, John, I imagine, to bask
in the pleasure of my company.

09:40.872 --> 09:44.125
Sir, I have been on the phone
all evening with delegates.

09:44.292 --> 09:47.796
Every one of whom is for Kennedy today
and would be yours tomorrow...

09:47.962 --> 09:51.800
- If you just announce you were running.
- A catholic won in a catholic state.

09:51.966 --> 09:55.220
Big fucking deal. You think
he could do that in West Virginia?

09:55.386 --> 09:59.265
This country is not gonna elect
a catholic president.

09:59.432 --> 10:01.351
He's starting to run away
from the pack.

10:01.518 --> 10:05.396
Nominations are not won
on the campaign trail.

10:05.563 --> 10:08.108
They are won on the convention floor.

10:13.696 --> 10:15.740
Bird, get me a drink, will you?

10:15.907 --> 10:17.617
Lady bird: All right.

10:18.785 --> 10:20.745
[Rm]

10:21.621 --> 10:23.873
He better decide if he wants this.

10:24.040 --> 10:26.501
He's never wanted anything more
in his whole life.

10:26.668 --> 10:28.461
- He'll run.
- It'd be too late.

10:28.628 --> 10:31.840
He's the best senate majority leader
this country's ever had.

10:32.006 --> 10:34.384
He works harder
than the other 99 senators combined.

10:34.551 --> 10:37.137
He doesn't understand
why he's not the party's favorite.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.931
He doesn't understand
why they don't just hand it to him.

10:40.098 --> 10:43.268
Nobody gets handed the presidency.

10:43.434 --> 10:45.520
Why won't he commit?

10:46.521 --> 10:48.940
- That's complicated.
- He's afraid.

10:49.107 --> 10:50.191
Of what?

10:50.358 --> 10:53.528
Hell, every politician's afraid
people won't vote for him.

10:53.695 --> 10:56.406
He's afraid people won't love him.

10:59.784 --> 11:01.984
Bob [over radio]:
All eyes are on West Virginia today...

11:02.120 --> 11:05.623
As voters cast their votes
in the state's primary election.

11:05.790 --> 11:06.916
In a surprising upset...

11:07.083 --> 11:10.295
Senator John Kennedy has won
the West Virginia primary.

11:11.045 --> 11:13.965
Many believed the issue
of his religion was insurmountable...

11:14.132 --> 11:17.177
But here is what senator Kennedy
had to say about it:

11:17.343 --> 11:20.180
I appreciate that question,
and I'll tell you when any man...

11:20.346 --> 11:24.517
Stands on the steps of the capitol and
takes the oath of office of president...

11:24.684 --> 11:28.897
He puts one hand on the Bible
and raises the other hand to god...

11:29.063 --> 11:32.442
As he takes his oath.
Now, if he... if he breaks his oath...

11:32.609 --> 11:36.738
I've never seen
a politician look that good on TV.

11:36.905 --> 11:38.948
Oh, angel, he's not that handsome.

11:39.115 --> 11:42.076
- I, John Fitzgerald Kennedy...
- Johnson: I've never seen a movie star...

11:42.243 --> 11:44.621
- Look that good on TV.
- Heh, heh.

11:45.163 --> 11:47.832
The office of president
of the United States...

11:47.999 --> 11:52.962
And will, to the best of my ability,
preserve, protect and defend...

11:53.129 --> 11:55.798
The constitution of the United States,
so help me, god.

11:55.965 --> 11:59.302
Jesus, he just swore himself in.

11:59.469 --> 12:01.389
Newscaster:
What's Jack got the rest haven't got?

12:01.554 --> 12:03.640
The "matinee" face?
The Kennedy name?

12:04.140 --> 12:05.183
The Kennedy fortune...

12:05.350 --> 12:06.601
[Television turns off]

12:07.644 --> 12:09.020
[Sighs]

12:10.396 --> 12:12.440
Lyndon, honey.

12:12.774 --> 12:14.651
Do you want this?

12:21.074 --> 12:22.492
[Rm]

12:22.784 --> 12:25.119
Do you know why I married you?

12:27.372 --> 12:30.959
I had other offers, but I chose you.

12:31.125 --> 12:34.712
- Do you know why?
- I have no earthly idea.

12:34.879 --> 12:35.922
[Clears throat]

12:36.798 --> 12:38.216
Because you asked.

12:39.717 --> 12:42.470
On our first date, when other boys...

12:42.637 --> 12:46.641
Would be thinking about
how to steal a kiss...

12:47.183 --> 12:49.811
You asked me to marry you.

12:51.479 --> 12:54.190
You didn't answer right away, though.

12:54.357 --> 12:55.733
Well, it hit me like a whammy.

12:55.900 --> 12:58.027
I'd only known you
for about 20 minutes.

12:59.362 --> 13:03.616
Ample time to fall in love with me.

13:06.119 --> 13:08.746
When father first met you, he said:

13:08.913 --> 13:14.002
"Daughter, you brought home
a lot of boys.

13:14.669 --> 13:17.630
This time, you brought home a man."

13:20.383 --> 13:23.344
At least he liked me right away.

13:24.220 --> 13:27.015
Angel, my point is...

13:27.515 --> 13:29.892
You knew what you wanted...

13:30.810 --> 13:32.687
And you got it.

13:33.938 --> 13:38.609
And I couldn't have said "yes"
if you hadn't asked.

13:52.874 --> 13:55.114
Newscaster [on TV]:
Convention fever grips Los Angeles...

13:55.251 --> 13:56.669
Where the democrats convene.

13:56.878 --> 13:59.922
Partisans of senator Kennedy radiate
the cheer and confidence...

14:00.089 --> 14:03.343
Of the powerful front-runner,
who is clearly the man to beat.

14:03.509 --> 14:06.512
The only major threat to Kennedy's hopes
among the declared candidates...

14:06.679 --> 14:09.140
Is senate majority leader
lyndon Johnson.

14:09.307 --> 14:14.103
Chairman: The convention of the
Democratic party of the United States...

14:14.270 --> 14:16.522
Is now called in session.

14:19.359 --> 14:21.444
Rowe: You need to go see
the Wyoming delegates.

14:21.611 --> 14:25.114
Why the hell are we still fighting
over western states?

14:25.281 --> 14:28.117
Their delegates are meeting
with Kennedy right now.

14:28.284 --> 14:30.078
Jack or Bobby?

14:30.244 --> 14:32.038
Teddy, sir.

14:32.205 --> 14:35.291
Christ, this place is infested.

14:47.303 --> 14:49.806
Bobby: "I have zero intention
of running for president"?

14:50.640 --> 14:53.935
I had a change of heart.

14:54.102 --> 14:56.687
Can't believe you'd look another man
in the eye and lie.

14:56.854 --> 14:59.494
Next one of you who says
a disparaging thing about Jack's health...

14:59.649 --> 15:01.359
I'll personally knock his teeth out.

15:01.526 --> 15:05.696
You said he's never felt better.
That wouldn't be a lie now, would it?

15:06.823 --> 15:08.908
Balloting starts in two hours.

15:09.075 --> 15:12.036
You don't take me down
in the first two rounds...

15:12.203 --> 15:15.039
- I'm gonna beat you.
- There won't be a second round.

15:15.206 --> 15:16.791
You seem awful confident.

15:16.958 --> 15:18.918
I can count.

15:20.461 --> 15:22.088
[Rm]

15:22.672 --> 15:29.303
Chairman: They will receive the call
of the roll of state, of voting...

15:29.470 --> 15:34.183
For the nomination of president
of the United States.

15:34.350 --> 15:37.520
Mr. Chairman,
Wyoming's vote will make...

15:37.687 --> 15:41.232
A majority for senator Kennedy.

15:41.983 --> 15:44.152
[Cheering on TV]

16:02.712 --> 16:05.047
Chairman:
Can we get the vote from Wyoming?

16:05.214 --> 16:09.635
First-round knockout, boys.
Just like rocky marciano.

16:09.802 --> 16:11.053
The times wants a comment.

16:11.220 --> 16:14.307
Tell them there's a new heavyweight
champion. His name is Kennedy.

16:14.474 --> 16:17.161
- How's the acceptance speech coming?
- Easiest speech I've ever had to write.

16:17.185 --> 16:20.730
Bobby, we're getting 20 calls a minute
about the vp. Everyone wants a name.

16:20.897 --> 16:22.732
First, we have to pick a name.

16:24.192 --> 16:26.319
[Telephone ringing]

16:33.618 --> 16:35.411
Hello?

16:38.247 --> 16:39.790
Lyndon.

16:40.458 --> 16:42.293
Lyndon, honey, wake up.

16:42.460 --> 16:44.420
- Wake up.
- What's the matter, bird?

16:44.587 --> 16:46.631
It's John Kennedy.

16:47.632 --> 16:49.425
[Rm]

16:50.551 --> 16:52.929
This is lyndon Johnson.

16:56.516 --> 17:00.686
Walter, order a fresh pot of coffee,
please. I have to get dressed.

17:00.853 --> 17:02.271
Yes, ma'am.

17:02.438 --> 17:07.234
Oh, yes. Yes, honey,
the red tie is so much better.

17:07.401 --> 17:09.487
Thanks, sweetheart.

17:10.238 --> 17:12.281
- Love... yeah, just fix it now a little.
- Yep.

17:12.823 --> 17:15.117
- Okay?
- Yep.

17:24.377 --> 17:25.836
[Knock on door]

17:31.259 --> 17:34.971
- Lyndon.
- Hi, Jack. Come on in.

17:35.471 --> 17:37.014
Thank you.

17:40.851 --> 17:44.146
Make sure symington, Humphrey
and Stevenson are all near their phones.

17:44.313 --> 17:46.524
We'll make our choice today.

17:46.691 --> 17:47.900
What's wrong?

17:48.067 --> 17:50.361
You're not gonna believe
where your brother is.

17:51.112 --> 17:55.283
Lyndon, you have more experience
and more talent, more wisdom.

17:55.449 --> 17:59.912
Unfortunately, this is politics,
and none of that matters.

18:00.329 --> 18:01.581
The better man won.

18:01.747 --> 18:03.165
I'm not better.

18:03.666 --> 18:05.376
Better-looking, maybe.

18:05.543 --> 18:06.544
[Chuckles]

18:06.711 --> 18:09.463
Yeah, if! Had some
of those Kennedy genes...

18:09.630 --> 18:12.258
I might've got some
of the Kennedy delegates.

18:12.425 --> 18:14.260
I think the press was too hard on you.

18:14.427 --> 18:17.555
Well, I could walk
on the potomac river, and next day...

18:17.722 --> 18:20.891
The headlines would read:
"Johnson can't swim."

18:26.188 --> 18:28.774
You mind if I ask you a question,
lyndon?

18:29.775 --> 18:31.215
Bobby:
You're out of your mind, Jack!

18:31.360 --> 18:33.338
You couldn't have made a worse choice
if you tried.

18:33.362 --> 18:35.242
- I spoke with dad. He agreed.
- Spoke with dad?

18:35.323 --> 18:38.451
- If we wanna win, we need Johnson.
- Why didn't you consult with me?

18:38.618 --> 18:40.762
We also agreed we'd never
convince you it was a good idea.

18:40.786 --> 18:42.204
Maybe because it isn't.

18:42.371 --> 18:44.540
Johnson and his men spent
the last 72 hours...

18:44.707 --> 18:47.269
Trying to convince the entire delegation
you have Addison's disease.

18:47.293 --> 18:48.419
I do have Addison's disease.

18:48.586 --> 18:50.588
- That's not the point.
- Labor hates him.

18:50.755 --> 18:52.965
Civil rights leaders hate him.
Liberals hate him.

18:53.132 --> 18:57.553
Kenny, we will win the liberal vote anyway.
We need southerners. We need Texas.

18:57.720 --> 19:00.348
The only person Johnson will
ever be loyal to is Johnson.

19:00.514 --> 19:03.726
Bobby, I'd rather him serve
under me as vice president...

19:03.893 --> 19:07.355
Than fight for control of the government
as leader of the senate.

19:07.521 --> 19:10.024
We can't be the only ones
who think this is a bad idea.

19:10.191 --> 19:13.694
Well, as it turns out, you might not be
because he hasn't accepted it yet.

19:15.988 --> 19:17.365
[Knock on door]

19:17.573 --> 19:19.992
George, look into this, will you?

19:20.159 --> 19:21.744
Yes, sir.

19:22.244 --> 19:25.206
Yeah. Hello there.
Is majority leader here?

19:25.373 --> 19:27.041
- Sir?
- Gentlemen...

19:27.208 --> 19:29.543
Can you give us a minute?

19:33.547 --> 19:34.799
[Bobby clears throat]

19:36.384 --> 19:38.052
Listen, I...

19:38.219 --> 19:40.805
I think you should decline the offer.

19:41.931 --> 19:46.227
Say it was an honor to be considered,
but your duty is to the senate.

19:47.812 --> 19:51.023
I think we could have a much more
effective partnership with you...

19:51.190 --> 19:53.818
In your role as majority leader.

19:53.984 --> 19:56.445
Is this what your brother thinks?

19:56.612 --> 19:59.615
Do you really want this job?
It's too small for you.

19:59.782 --> 20:02.326
Did senator Kennedy ask you
to relay this message?

20:02.493 --> 20:04.412
No, sir, I am here on my own.

20:04.578 --> 20:08.791
Okay, well,
I will take that tidbit of wisdom...

20:08.958 --> 20:11.085
Under advisement.

20:13.629 --> 20:15.881
[Rm]

20:17.383 --> 20:19.343
Thank you, Bobby.

20:23.472 --> 20:26.100
- What'd he want?
- What do you think he wanted?

20:26.267 --> 20:27.476
He may be right.

20:27.643 --> 20:30.980
If you run with Kennedy and lose,
you're giving up your senate seat too.

20:31.147 --> 20:32.898
- No, he won't.
- What do you mean?

20:33.065 --> 20:34.525
He can run for both offices.

20:34.692 --> 20:36.485
Not at the same time.

20:36.652 --> 20:38.571
- We changed the law.
- When?

20:39.071 --> 20:42.950
- When I asked them to.
- I have that number for you, sir.

20:43.951 --> 20:47.246
- What'd you find out?
- Ten of 36.

20:48.414 --> 20:50.583
Okay, talk to me.

20:52.835 --> 20:54.503
It's a thankless job.

20:54.670 --> 20:58.841
Yeah, well, so is being school teacher
in blanco county, Texas.

21:01.135 --> 21:03.179
Of the 36 men
who have been vice president...

21:03.345 --> 21:06.599
10 have gone on to become president.

21:06.766 --> 21:11.312
Kennedy loses, the majority leader will be
the most powerful democrat in the country.

21:11.479 --> 21:13.439
Kennedy wins,
the majority leader will still be...

21:13.606 --> 21:16.150
The most powerful democrat
in congress.

21:16.317 --> 21:19.111
There's just no power
in the vice presidency.

21:22.072 --> 21:24.992
Walter, how long you been with me?

21:26.202 --> 21:27.578
Twenty-one years.

21:28.579 --> 21:34.418
And in 21 years, can you think of a time
that I have taken over a new office...

21:34.585 --> 21:38.589
And not made it 100 times
more powerful than when I got there?

21:40.090 --> 21:41.133
No, sir.

21:41.717 --> 21:45.012
Power is where power goes.

Man: Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

22:11.163 --> 22:13.666
- Yes, sir.
- Johnson: They love him.

22:13.833 --> 22:16.085
They believe in him.

22:16.252 --> 22:18.963
They know
the president's civil rights law...

22:19.129 --> 22:21.090
Is gonna change everything.

22:21.549 --> 22:23.634
The president doesn't have
a civil rights law.

22:23.801 --> 22:25.761
He has a civil rights bill.

22:25.928 --> 22:28.430

of the United States:

22:56.375 --> 22:57.835
John Fitzgerald Kennedy.

here is President John F. Kennedy...

Delivering his inaugural address.

23:04.425 --> 23:09.930

- Nor in the life...

- Of this administration.

23:18.772 --> 23:23.319
Nor even perhaps in our lifetime
on this planet.

23:23.485 --> 23:25.404

23:26.113 --> 23:28.490
- Juanita, dear?
- Yes, sir?

23:28.657 --> 23:29.950
I wanna write a letter.

"I hereby request
that the state department...

23:33.078 --> 23:36.290
The defense department
and the central intelligence agency...

23:36.457 --> 23:38.459
Cooperate fully
with the vice president."

23:38.626 --> 23:39.960
Lyndon did not write that.

23:40.127 --> 23:43.088
- That's his signature right there.
- Ha, ha, ha.

23:43.255 --> 23:46.675
Oh, what, NASA too? He even requested
oversight of the space program?

23:46.842 --> 23:49.136
Wants control of everything
from here to the moon.

23:49.303 --> 23:51.764
I say we send it
to the Washington post, right?

23:53.724 --> 23:57.811
Last month, Johnson was the most
powerful democrat in all of Washington.

23:57.978 --> 24:01.482
Now he answers to my kid brother
and his Harvard roommate.

24:01.649 --> 24:04.360
Nobody's gonna do anything
to embarrass my vice president.

24:04.526 --> 24:06.807
- He embarrasses himself.
- Started calling himself lbj...

24:06.946 --> 24:09.740
After fdr was elected.
Thought it sounded more presidential.

24:09.907 --> 24:11.951
Bobby:
Well, he's no fdr, and he's no jfk.

24:12.117 --> 24:15.120
He's lyndon "I'll never be president
in a million years" Johnson.

24:15.287 --> 24:18.540
I'm aware of your feelings. That's why
I'm putting Kenny in charge of him.

24:21.502 --> 24:22.920
What?

24:23.087 --> 24:25.767
Congratulations, Kenny. You're
my new liaison to the vice president.

24:28.300 --> 24:30.886
I'm sorry,
am I being punished for something?

24:31.053 --> 24:33.430
He's a sensitive man
with an enormous ego.

24:33.806 --> 24:35.349
Your job is to placate him.

24:35.516 --> 24:39.478
Now, I don't care if you have to kiss
his ass all over town in order to do it.

24:39.645 --> 24:41.772
I can't have him
causing problems for me.

24:41.939 --> 24:46.193
I'm sure we can find something
to keep him occupied.

24:46.360 --> 24:49.279
Johnson:
What the fuck is the pceeo?

24:49.446 --> 24:53.033
It's the "president's committee
on equal employment opportunity."

24:53.200 --> 24:55.786
The president wants to ensure
all government agencies...

24:55.953 --> 25:00.332
And contractors exercise
fair hiring practices with regards to race.

25:00.499 --> 25:02.835
It's his first major initiative
in civil rights.

25:03.002 --> 25:05.129
Our southern democrats
are gonna hate this.

25:05.295 --> 25:08.716
No shit, and when this
trumped-up committee inevitably...

25:08.882 --> 25:12.845
Fails to address
this country's civil rights problems...

25:13.012 --> 25:15.681
Well, the rest of the democrats
are gonna hate that.

25:17.016 --> 25:20.519
So why the fuck am I busy alienating...

25:20.686 --> 25:25.441
Every son of a bitch
in my party when...

25:25.983 --> 25:28.110
If I'm gonna make a run in '68...

Well, I'm gonna need people
to fucking like me!

25:51.425 --> 25:53.677

when I was 13 years old...

25:53.844 --> 25:58.599
I was driving home with my daddy,
and I made some smart-ass comment...

25:58.766 --> 26:00.851
Pissed him off,
he slammed on the brakes...

26:01.018 --> 26:03.687
Tossed me out the truck,
told me I was walking home.

26:03.854 --> 26:07.941
Well, it was hot as Hades,
six, seven miles to go...

26:08.108 --> 26:13.072
So I was feeling real bad for myself...

26:13.238 --> 26:19.453
When I look up, and I see
this old Chevy kicking up dust.

26:19.620 --> 26:22.915
Pulls to a stop in front of me,
and this beautiful woman...

26:23.082 --> 26:29.338
With curly red hair, leans out
the window, smiles and says:

26:29.505 --> 26:31.799
"Need a ride, son?"

26:32.591 --> 26:34.218
Oh, yeah.

26:34.635 --> 26:37.012
She had the biggest titties I ever saw...

26:37.179 --> 26:42.768
And I stared at them
the whole ride home.

26:43.477 --> 26:46.939
And I never would have seen them
if my daddy hadn't...

26:47.106 --> 26:48.649
Punished me to begin with.

26:50.275 --> 26:52.194
So, what are you saying?

26:52.361 --> 26:54.905
When life gives you lemons,
you make lemonade?

26:55.697 --> 27:01.036
No, George, I'm saying, sometimes,
you think the lord is giving you lemons...

27:01.203 --> 27:04.456
And, in fact, he's giving you
big, beautiful titties.

27:04.832 --> 27:08.585
So there's an upside to you being
appointed chairman to this committee?

27:08.752 --> 27:12.798
Well, this damn civil rights issue is
gonna tear the democrats in two.

27:12.965 --> 27:16.593
We got rival camps
that are never gonna see eye to eye.

27:16.760 --> 27:19.930
But as long as they're sitting
at the table...

27:20.097 --> 27:22.766
They're gonna need an interpreter.

27:22.933 --> 27:27.062
And Kennedys don't speak southern.
Southerners don't speak Kennedy.

27:27.229 --> 27:30.983
I'm the only man who's fluent
in both languages.

27:31.150 --> 27:32.401
Which side are you on?

27:32.568 --> 27:34.403
You're missing the point.

27:34.570 --> 27:39.825
As long as neither side declares
all-out war, both sides need me.

27:39.992 --> 27:44.955
The best thing that can happen for me is
this civil rights debate goes on forever.

27:45.122 --> 27:47.124
And how do we make that happen, sir?

27:47.875 --> 27:49.835
Compromise, boys.

27:50.210 --> 27:52.671
Endless compromise.

27:53.088 --> 27:57.342
Russell: So chairman of the equal
employment opportunities committee.

27:57.509 --> 27:59.344
Boy, those Kennedys
must really hate you.

27:59.511 --> 28:01.013
-Ha-ha-ha. Johnson: Yeah, yeah.

28:01.180 --> 28:04.141
- I drew the short straw on this one.
- I wouldn't worry about it.

28:04.308 --> 28:07.019
I don't imagine that committee's
gonna be around very long.

28:07.186 --> 28:08.228
Don't be so sure.

28:09.062 --> 28:11.064
Never underestimate
southern delegation.

28:11.231 --> 28:14.109
My army may be small,
but our cause is mighty.

28:14.276 --> 28:18.447
Am I talking to senator Richard Russell
or general stonewall Jackson?

28:18.614 --> 28:21.950
No, you're talking to the man
who defeated three presidents on this.

28:22.117 --> 28:23.577
I'll defeat a fourth.

28:23.744 --> 28:27.456
What did Abe Lincoln say
after he woke up from a three-day drunk?

28:27.623 --> 28:29.625
- I don't know.
- "I freed the what?"

28:29.833 --> 28:31.543
[Both laughing]

28:31.710 --> 28:34.338
- Thank you, Eddie.
- Yeah, thank you, Eddie.

28:37.257 --> 28:40.010
Government has a $1 billion contract
to build a new plane.

28:40.177 --> 28:42.262
I know exactly
where that contract should go.

28:42.429 --> 28:44.473
I bet you do, and I want nothing more...

28:44.640 --> 28:47.601
Than to see that lockheed plant
in Georgia get this contract.

28:47.768 --> 28:51.271
Glad to hear it. You convince that
committee of yours to go along with it.

28:51.438 --> 28:53.941
I will. I will.

28:54.107 --> 28:58.570
After you convince lockheed
to make some changes at the plant.

29:02.658 --> 29:04.159
Not making any changes.

29:05.535 --> 29:08.789
Why don't those Kennedys
just leave these niggers alone?

29:08.956 --> 29:11.500
- They were happy.
- Come on, dick.

29:11.667 --> 29:16.046
I can't have signs all over the plant
saying "colored" this and "white" that.

29:16.213 --> 29:18.632
Now you don't like
separate drinking fountains?

29:18.799 --> 29:21.969
Oh, lord. All right, fine.
I'll bring in paper cups.

29:22.135 --> 29:24.429
I'm not saying
that you're not right about this...

29:24.596 --> 29:28.642
But you need to do
a little bit more on this one.

29:28.809 --> 29:31.103
You're gonna have to hire some nigras.

29:31.770 --> 29:33.772
Well, who do you think mops the floors?

29:33.939 --> 29:36.400
I'm not talking aboutjanitors.

29:36.566 --> 29:40.904
I'm talking about engineers,
skmedlabon

29:41.071 --> 29:42.447
show me a skilled one first.

29:43.365 --> 29:46.493
Government's got no business
telling employers who they should hire.

29:46.660 --> 29:50.414
It's the government's billion dollars.
I'm guessing we got some right.

29:50.580 --> 29:52.791
Forced hiring's a stone's throw away
from forced labor.

29:52.958 --> 29:56.336
- Last I heard, we were against that here.
- You don't have to convince me.

29:56.503 --> 29:59.006
I'm the one going 15 rounds
with the Kennedys on this.

29:59.172 --> 30:01.049
Those Harvard boys not gonna tell us...

30:01.216 --> 30:04.344
- How to run the state of Georgia.
- Of course not.

30:04.511 --> 30:08.724
But the Kennedy did get elected
by appealing to the colored man.

30:08.890 --> 30:11.852
Now, if we play this right,
we're gonna have those nigras...

30:12.019 --> 30:14.229
Voting democrat the next 200 years.

30:14.396 --> 30:16.398
You want me to surrender?
What are you doing?

30:16.565 --> 30:20.736
No. I am asking you...
I'm begging you...

30:20.902 --> 30:25.782
To give these Kennedys
a little something just to quiet them down.

30:25.949 --> 30:29.328
It ain't gonna make any difference,
but if we don't move at all...

30:29.494 --> 30:32.205
Their allies are gonna line up
against us...

30:32.372 --> 30:36.376
And there's gonna be no way to put
the brake on all sorts of wild legislation.

30:36.543 --> 30:40.630
- It'll be reconstruction all over again.
- Well, let them try. Just let them try.

30:40.797 --> 30:43.508
I'll use every means at my disposal
to defend this cause...

30:43.675 --> 30:46.094
Till the last breath of air
escapes my lungs.

30:46.261 --> 30:48.096
Keep the air in your lungs, dick.

30:48.263 --> 30:51.099
I'm... I'm gonna get you
what you want...

30:51.266 --> 30:55.270
But just help me out a little bit here.

30:58.398 --> 31:01.068
Newscaster [on TV]:
Since the 1954 supreme court ruling...

31:01.234 --> 31:03.779
In brown v. The board of education...

31:03.945 --> 31:07.491
The issue of civil rights has
taken hold throughout the nation.

31:08.158 --> 31:10.702
Last year,
in greensboro, north Carolina...

31:10.869 --> 31:15.290
Four negro college students staged
a sit-in at a whites-only lunch counter...

31:15.457 --> 31:20.087
Sparking a wave of similar
demonstrations in other states.

31:21.046 --> 31:22.589
And earlier this spring...

31:22.756 --> 31:24.549
A group known
as the freedom riders...

31:24.716 --> 31:27.052
Began their voyage
throughout the south.

31:27.219 --> 31:31.098
They have been met by cameras
and, at times, by mobs.

31:31.807 --> 31:33.850
This week in Jackson, Mississippi...

31:34.017 --> 31:37.479
Highway patrol officers
and national guardsmen kept the peace.

31:37.646 --> 31:38.939
But this much is clear:

31:39.815 --> 31:43.485
The cause of integration is
a national issue.

31:44.444 --> 31:46.029
[Chattering]

31:47.239 --> 31:48.365
Man 1: Sir. Man 2: Sir.

31:52.202 --> 31:53.412
Please take your seats.

31:58.917 --> 32:02.379
By presidential order, this committee
on equal-employment opportunity...

32:02.546 --> 32:05.382
Is to be comprised of:

32:07.384 --> 32:09.469
"Four members of the cabinet...

32:09.636 --> 32:12.764
Four heads of agencies
and secretaries...

32:12.931 --> 32:15.892
The army, Navy and air force."

32:16.893 --> 32:20.522
Out of curiosity, who the hell are all you?

32:23.650 --> 32:26.903
We got the undersecretary of state,
the undersecretary of defense.

32:27.070 --> 32:29.030
We got Nick katzenbach.
What's the matter?

32:29.197 --> 32:32.742
Bobby Kennedy too busy
to join us today?

32:32.909 --> 32:34.911
Sir, the Attorney General had a previous...

32:35.078 --> 32:37.956
Despite the fact that none
of your bosses are here...

32:38.123 --> 32:43.879
There is one person on this long list
that did, in fact, show up.

32:44.045 --> 32:47.591
And it is the vice president.
So let's get this thing started.

32:48.216 --> 32:51.887
First order of business,
$1 billion contract...

32:52.053 --> 32:54.264
To build a new transport airplane.

32:54.431 --> 32:57.809
Senator Russell seems to think
the contract is going to Georgia.

32:59.853 --> 33:01.605
That's because it is.

33:01.771 --> 33:05.817
That lockheed plant's record
on civil rights is disgraceful.

33:08.862 --> 33:10.071
How old are you?

33:12.699 --> 33:15.577
- Thirty-two. Sir.
- Mm.

33:15.744 --> 33:19.623
Richard Russell is the leader
of the southern Democratic caucus...

33:19.789 --> 33:22.459
And chairman
of the armed services committee.

33:22.626 --> 33:25.420
We are gonna work
with senator Russell on this.

33:26.046 --> 33:31.218
Better to have him inside the tent
pissing out than outside pissing in.

33:31.384 --> 33:33.720
Sir, I know I speak for my boss
when I say...

33:33.887 --> 33:36.765
That this is a fight
in which we should not give an inch.

33:36.932 --> 33:40.602
The secretary of labor's drafted a list of
demands that he would like addressed...

33:40.769 --> 33:43.188
Before we award the contract
to any plant.

33:43.355 --> 33:45.941
We need to use this opportunity
to demonstrate the full power...

33:46.107 --> 33:47.567
Of this committee.

33:48.735 --> 33:52.614
If your boss wants to make demands,
tell him to deliver them to me in person.

33:53.406 --> 33:56.326
And, son,
if this committee had any real power...

33:56.493 --> 34:00.705
The man you work for would be sitting
at this table instead of you.

34:01.206 --> 34:02.791
This meeting is adjourned.

34:08.170 --> 34:11.007
[Rm]

34:13.635 --> 34:15.971
Man: Mr. President, over here!

34:46.167 --> 34:47.293
[Gunshot]

34:48.712 --> 34:49.795
[Gunshot]

34:50.338 --> 34:52.090
Get down. Get down! Go, go, go!

34:52.257 --> 34:53.800
[Gunshot]

34:53.967 --> 34:55.552
I'm switching to Charlie frequency.

34:55.719 --> 34:57.137
Stay with him.

34:57.304 --> 34:59.306
Stay down, stay down! Go, go, go!

35:15.905 --> 35:18.617
[Laughing]

35:18.825 --> 35:20.827
[Rm]

35:21.745 --> 35:23.163
[Babbling]

35:31.296 --> 35:34.007
- Good morning, Mrs. Lincoln.
- Good morning, Mr. Kennedy.

35:34.174 --> 35:36.343
- Mr. Bobby.
- Bobby: Hi, Caroline. How are you?

35:36.509 --> 35:37.761
Here you go.

35:37.927 --> 35:39.304
- Hi, Caroline.
- Come on, hon.

35:39.471 --> 35:40.639
John: Good morning, lyndon.

35:40.805 --> 35:44.142
- Oh, hello, Mr. President.
- Sorry to keep you waiting.

35:44.309 --> 35:46.561
- How you getting along?
- John: Busy morning.

35:47.270 --> 35:50.649
How are we doing on this committee?

35:50.815 --> 35:51.941
Fine, Mr. President.

35:52.359 --> 35:55.153
Need to make sure
that this lockheed contract conforms...

35:55.320 --> 35:57.572
- To the committee's purpose.
- Well, ahem...

35:57.739 --> 36:00.158
Senator Russell has assured me that...

36:00.325 --> 36:04.120
We can expect to see
some significant changes in that plant.

36:04.537 --> 36:06.081
That's not what I hear.

36:07.415 --> 36:10.794
If you're concerned,
you should come to one of our meetings.

36:10.960 --> 36:13.213
If you'd like me
to express my dissatisfaction...

36:13.380 --> 36:16.257
In front of the entire committee,
that could be arranged.

36:16.424 --> 36:18.760
John: Lyndon, we're not awarding
a government contract...

36:18.927 --> 36:20.887
To a plant that violates civil rights.

36:21.054 --> 36:24.432
And you might remind senator Russell
that we don't need his help on this.

36:24.599 --> 36:27.560
We've got a lockheed plant
in California happy to build planes.

36:27.727 --> 36:31.356
With all due respect,
if you take that contract from Russell...

36:31.523 --> 36:34.109
All it will show is
that you can't make him do...

36:34.275 --> 36:36.444
One damn thing
that he doesn't wanna do.

36:37.737 --> 36:39.531
Now, you have to understand
his thinking.

36:39.698 --> 36:42.117
It's straight out of the last century.

36:42.283 --> 36:44.911
He's never gonna be
a progressive like us.

36:45.078 --> 36:46.621
[John chuckles]

36:48.289 --> 36:50.959
Why should we be working
with him on this, then?

36:51.126 --> 36:53.753
Because you don't wanna make
an enemy of Richard Russell.

36:53.920 --> 36:57.632
He'll put the brakes on every legislation
we're trying to move through congress.

36:57.799 --> 37:00.468
We're not gonna let
one senator hold us hostage.

37:00.635 --> 37:04.931
I suggest you don't wanna find out
how powerful that one senator can be.

37:05.098 --> 37:08.643
I need this committee to show
a strong record right from the start.

37:09.144 --> 37:12.355
Something that demonstrates
concrete changes on civil rights.

37:12.522 --> 37:16.276
We can't do that if we're giving
a huge contract to a discriminatory plant.

37:16.443 --> 37:19.154
On the contrary, I think we can, sir.

37:19.612 --> 37:23.241
If we send that contract to Georgia...

37:23.408 --> 37:27.829
Then I can get Russell to make
that plant hire a number of negros.

37:27.996 --> 37:30.957
And then, we can have
white men and black men...

37:31.124 --> 37:33.877
Working side by side
in the deep south...

37:34.043 --> 37:36.755
Building america's newest airplane.

37:36.921 --> 37:41.593
This can be one hell of a victory
for this administration.

37:48.308 --> 37:50.435
All right, lyndon, but...

37:50.894 --> 37:52.687
You're gonna have to move Russell.

37:53.688 --> 37:54.856
Thank you, Mr. President.

37:55.023 --> 37:59.444
Oh, and if! May, there'sjust
one other item I'd like to discuss.

37:59.611 --> 38:02.238
What's happening with Sarah Hughes?

38:02.405 --> 38:03.823
The judge from Dallas?

38:05.909 --> 38:09.204
You haven't responded
to my recommendation to nominate her.

38:09.370 --> 38:11.956
It's not your place
to make that recommendation.

38:12.123 --> 38:14.375
She'd make a damn fine judge.

38:14.542 --> 38:17.712
- She's too old.
- To you, everybody's too old.

38:18.129 --> 38:19.339
[John chuckles]

38:20.632 --> 38:22.967
Senators make those recommendations.
You know that.

38:23.134 --> 38:26.346
I promised Sarah Hughes
that appointment.

38:26.513 --> 38:28.932
It's Ralph yarborough's
recommendation to make.

38:30.099 --> 38:34.229
How's it gonna look to my state
if I can't get a federal judge appointed?

38:34.395 --> 38:38.191
I understand your frustration, lyndon,
but this is how it's gotta be done.

38:38.358 --> 38:41.986
We'll give Sarah Hughes a look
next time. Thanks for stopping by.

38:49.994 --> 38:52.455
Russell:
She'll be ready to take off this summer.

38:52.622 --> 38:54.499
Record time.

38:55.208 --> 38:57.418
Johnson:
Are you sure that big bitch will fly?

38:57.585 --> 39:00.672
Russell: She'll fly all right.
Built by Georgia's finest.

39:01.756 --> 39:03.508
Half of them, anyway.

39:04.551 --> 39:05.802
Thanks to you.

39:05.969 --> 39:07.595
[Chuckles]

39:10.390 --> 39:13.059
Jesus, lyndon.
God, put that thing away.

39:13.768 --> 39:15.812
Look at that.
Number-two man in Washington.

39:15.979 --> 39:18.189
Attorney generals
don't become president.

39:18.356 --> 39:22.694
There's a lot of things these Kennedy
boys do that no one else has done.

39:22.861 --> 39:24.904
He is a nice-looking boy.

39:30.159 --> 39:31.703
You know, I've been...

39:31.870 --> 39:35.290
Hearing disturbing news about
some goddamn civil rights bill.

39:37.750 --> 39:41.004
Yeah, I'm afraid
I've been hearing the same thing.

39:41.170 --> 39:43.732
I hope you're impressing on the president
the severity of the moment.

39:43.756 --> 39:48.136
Well, I have, but, unfortunately,
he doesn't answer to me or you.

39:50.513 --> 39:54.642
80 Kennedy won the presidency
by a fraction of a percent.

39:54.809 --> 39:57.562
Do you recall my margin of victory
that very same year? Ha-ha-ha.

39:58.104 --> 40:00.106
Mmm. Hang on, dick.

40:01.774 --> 40:05.445
- Yeah, I believe you were unopposed.
- That's right. I was. Unopposed.

40:05.612 --> 40:07.614
Six years before that too.

40:07.780 --> 40:10.283
And six years before that.
And you know what?

40:11.034 --> 40:14.454
Six years before that.
Are you plodding toward a point?

40:14.996 --> 40:19.542
I may not be president, but neither
am I ever in jeopardy of losing my job.

40:20.209 --> 40:23.046
So if the president sends
a civil rights bill to congress...

40:23.212 --> 40:27.050
It'll be my distinct pleasure
to see it die a painful death.

40:27.216 --> 40:29.552
And I'll kill every
other bill along the way.

40:29.719 --> 40:32.013
I don't care
if it costs my party the white house.

40:32.180 --> 40:36.684
I'm sure we can all sit down and come
to an agreement that we can all live with.

40:36.851 --> 40:40.396
It seems like every time we do that,
I'm the only one giving something up.

40:40.563 --> 40:43.441
And I'm about running out of things
that I can live without.

40:43.608 --> 40:48.112
Dick, you didn't have to give up
your billion-dollar airplane, did you?

40:48.905 --> 40:53.743
I'm not saying lay down and die,
but this train is leaving the station.

40:53.910 --> 40:57.538
So you can stand there
and watch it roll on by...

40:57.705 --> 41:01.793
Or you can hop on it with me
and try to slow the damn thing down.

41:10.510 --> 41:12.053
[Rm]

41:12.220 --> 41:13.888
[Sirens wailing]

41:16.808 --> 41:18.810
Guard: Move, move, move!

41:18.977 --> 41:20.019
Stay back! Stay back.

41:20.186 --> 41:22.386
Youngblood: We're not stopping
for anything, understand?

41:22.522 --> 41:24.962
- You bet, partner. You ready, bird?
- Youngblood: Here we go.

41:25.108 --> 41:26.901
- Let's move.
- Guard: Everybody back!

41:28.027 --> 41:29.445
Everyone back.

41:29.612 --> 41:30.780
Keep that area clear.

41:30.947 --> 41:33.032
Keep the area clear!

41:33.950 --> 41:35.618
Man 1: What's going on?
Man 2: Move!

41:36.411 --> 41:39.539
We're going right through
this door right here, sir. Here we go.

41:40.456 --> 41:41.499
Man 2: Copy that.

41:41.666 --> 41:43.126
Youngblood:
Get them out of here.

41:43.292 --> 41:45.503
- Back in the corner. Here we go.
- Woman: Sorry?

41:45.670 --> 41:46.713
Guard 1: Here you go.

41:47.296 --> 41:50.842
Nobody comes in unless he's got
a damn good reason to be here.

41:51.009 --> 41:53.886
- He wants you to call Washington.
- I'm not leaving this man.

41:54.053 --> 41:57.056
The president and governor connally
suffered gunshot wounds.

41:57.223 --> 42:00.309
I don't know the governor's condition,
but the president...

42:00.476 --> 42:01.644
It's bad.

42:02.478 --> 42:04.897
We need to get you to Washington
as soon as possible.

42:05.064 --> 42:06.482
I'm not leaving here.

42:07.108 --> 42:09.902
Mr. Vice president, safest place
for you is the white house.

42:10.069 --> 42:13.614
It would be unthinkable for me
to leave president Kennedy...

42:13.781 --> 42:16.242
While he fights for his life.

42:17.577 --> 42:19.037
Gentlemen...

42:19.203 --> 42:22.373
This is a time for prayer
if ever there was one.

42:31.007 --> 42:33.384
Newscaster [on TV]:
In another current trouble spot:

42:33.551 --> 42:35.136
Plaquemine, Louisiana.

42:35.303 --> 42:37.180
Mounted state troopers and police...

42:37.346 --> 42:40.099
Used tear gas
and high-pressure water hoses...

42:40.266 --> 42:43.561
In plaquemine last night to break up
a civil rights demonstration...

42:43.728 --> 42:45.897
That almost erupted into a race riot.

42:46.064 --> 42:50.026
How many more demonstrations do we
have to look at with hoses and dogs?

42:50.193 --> 42:52.737
I'm running out of ways
to explain to the press corps...

42:52.904 --> 42:54.590
Why the civil rights bill
isn't being sent to congress.

42:54.614 --> 42:56.574
I'm running out of ways
to explain it to congress.

42:56.616 --> 43:00.036
You take legislative action now,
all you'll do is fan the flames.

43:00.203 --> 43:01.871
We made promises
during the campaign.

43:02.038 --> 43:04.319
We sit on this bill,
our supporters will never forgive us.

43:04.373 --> 43:05.917
It is also the right thing to do.

43:06.084 --> 43:08.920
- It's the wrong time to do it.
- The wrong time?

43:09.087 --> 43:11.923
We've got kids in the street
getting their heads busted open.

43:12.090 --> 43:14.425
And how does sending
what will surely be...

43:14.592 --> 43:16.636
A failed bill to congress help kids?

43:16.803 --> 43:19.514
Well, burying our head in the sand
is not a solution.

43:19.680 --> 43:22.517
Neither is getting your ass handed
to you by Richard Russell.

43:22.683 --> 43:25.561
- I am so tired...
- Forget about the demise of the bill.

43:25.728 --> 43:27.772
What do you think
he'll do to your budget?

43:27.939 --> 43:30.441
Do you believe
they'll hold the budget bill hostage?

43:30.608 --> 43:33.236
To block civil rights,
they'll hold everything hostage.

43:33.402 --> 43:35.863
- To hell with Russell. We'll go around him.
- You can't.

43:36.030 --> 43:37.657
Then we'll go through him.

43:37.824 --> 43:41.702
We've got Martin Luther King writing
letters from jail. It's an embarrassment.

43:41.869 --> 43:44.997
- What are we waiting for?!
- Mr. President...

43:45.164 --> 43:47.458
I may not be the smartest man
in this room.

43:47.625 --> 43:51.587
Hell, I may not be as smart
as any man in this room.

43:51.754 --> 43:55.049
But I know the congress
of the United States.

43:55.216 --> 43:58.344
And if you submit
this civil rights bill now...

43:58.511 --> 44:00.429
It will never become law.

44:04.016 --> 44:05.059
Thank you, gentlemen.

44:17.780 --> 44:20.283
- What do you think?
- The time for negotiation is over.

44:20.449 --> 44:23.369
- What about southern democrats?
- You never had their support.

44:23.536 --> 44:26.080
This is one of those times
to draw a line in the sand.

44:26.247 --> 44:28.624
We could get to them through lyndon.
Send a message.

44:28.791 --> 44:31.294
They might listen to a southerner
who's on our side.

44:31.460 --> 44:33.713
What makes you think he's on our side?

44:34.839 --> 44:36.215
Kenny...

44:36.382 --> 44:38.384
Can we get this bill passed?

44:41.137 --> 44:43.097
I don't know, sir.

44:43.264 --> 44:45.433
It's not gonna be easy.

44:49.896 --> 44:53.232
Well, we don't do these things
because they're easy.

44:54.609 --> 44:56.110
We do them because they're hard.

44:58.863 --> 45:00.531
What do you want me to tell lyndon?

45:00.698 --> 45:02.742
He's no longer a part of this discussion.

45:03.326 --> 45:05.953
Russell: The Kennedys attended
private schools their entire lives.

45:06.120 --> 45:08.372
Now they wanna talk about equality.

45:08.539 --> 45:11.542
Voluntary integration is one thing,
but don't you think that I...

45:11.709 --> 45:14.837
As an American citizen,
shouldn't be forced to eat a hamburger...

45:15.004 --> 45:18.257
Next to someone in a restaurant
I don't wanna bump elbows with?

45:18.424 --> 45:21.052
Dick, I think it is unconscionable...

45:21.219 --> 45:24.722
That you, as an American citizen,
should ever...

45:24.889 --> 45:27.475
Be forced to eat a hamburger.

45:28.017 --> 45:29.477
Don't be a wisea... lyndon.

45:29.685 --> 45:30.686
[Chuckles]

45:30.895 --> 45:32.688
I don't find this topic amusing.

45:32.855 --> 45:35.274
Well, here's where I get confused.

45:35.441 --> 45:37.443
A baby calf is born.

45:37.610 --> 45:40.905
It grows into a cow,
lives on a farm, gets slaughtered...

45:41.072 --> 45:44.200
Butchered, packaged,
shipped, cooked...

45:44.367 --> 45:46.327
And finally served to you.

45:46.494 --> 45:51.374
Most, if not all, those steps required
the hands of black men.

45:51.540 --> 45:53.960
Why is it that
when it comes time to eat it...

45:54.126 --> 45:58.297
You can't stomach the notion of sitting
next to a black man while you chew?

45:58.464 --> 46:00.258
- If those...
- May I clear your plate?

46:00.424 --> 46:02.051
Oh, yes, Zephyr. Delicious.

46:02.218 --> 46:04.595
"If the law can compel me
to hire a negro...

46:04.762 --> 46:06.639
It can compel a negro
to work for me.

46:06.806 --> 46:09.934
And such a law would do nothing more
than enslave a minority."

46:10.393 --> 46:14.230
And that's what one senator had to say
about civil rights legislation. Thank you.

46:14.397 --> 46:17.566
That's probably strom thurmond.
He's an asshole and a moron.

46:17.733 --> 46:19.402
No, it was you.

46:20.820 --> 46:24.657
1949, your first speech
on the senate floor. Ha.

46:24.824 --> 46:29.078
You spoke for over an hour in opposition
to a civil rights bill just like this one.

46:29.912 --> 46:32.206
I remember watching you speak,
thinking to myself:

46:32.373 --> 46:34.333
"This young man's the future
of the south."

46:34.500 --> 46:35.960
[Johnson sighs]

46:37.211 --> 46:39.463
The best leaders of the time...

46:39.630 --> 46:43.509
From both our states,
voted for secession.

46:43.676 --> 46:48.055
And they were great men
who nearly destroyed america.

46:48.222 --> 46:51.267
I don't ever want a history book
to say that about me.

46:56.731 --> 46:58.733
Let me ask you something.

46:59.191 --> 47:01.551
[Whispering] When was the last time
you had a meal with her?

47:03.195 --> 47:05.281
[Whispering]
She's an employee...

47:05.448 --> 47:08.492
But if you think
that I would have any objection...

47:08.659 --> 47:11.579
Of breaking bread with her,
then you are a fool.

47:11.746 --> 47:13.622
So you're telling me she's your equal?

47:14.123 --> 47:18.169
That woman spends more time in
this house than anyone except lady bird.

47:18.336 --> 47:20.338
She is family.

47:20.504 --> 47:22.548
I don't know
how I missed the resemblance.

47:24.008 --> 47:26.927
Look, what I'm talking about here
is freedom.

47:27.386 --> 47:29.764
I'm talking about the preservation
of a way of life.

47:29.930 --> 47:33.517
A way of life
that you and I both grew up with.

47:33.684 --> 47:35.186
There's nothing wrong with that.

47:36.645 --> 47:39.106
Then why are we whispering?

47:40.358 --> 47:43.402
John [on TV]: One hundred years
of delay have passed...

47:43.569 --> 47:45.738
Since President Lincoln freed
the slaves.

47:46.113 --> 47:49.909
Yet their heirs, their grandsons,
are not fully free.

47:50.785 --> 47:54.288
They are not yet freed
from the bonds of injustice.

47:54.455 --> 47:57.666
They are not yet freed from social
and economic oppression.

47:58.167 --> 47:59.543
And this nation...

47:59.710 --> 48:03.089
For all its hopes and all its boasts...

48:03.255 --> 48:07.259
Will not be fully free
until all its citizens are free.

48:07.843 --> 48:11.097
Next week, / shall ask the congress
of the United States to act...

48:11.263 --> 48:14.308
To make a commitment
it has not fully made in this century...

48:14.475 --> 48:16.352
To the proposition that race...

48:16.519 --> 48:20.189
Has no place
in American life or law.

48:22.024 --> 48:26.320
Good morning, Mrs. Lincoln.
I'd like a moment with the president.

48:28.823 --> 48:32.660
Sir, vice president Johnson is here.
What shall I tell him?

48:33.661 --> 48:35.287
You can go in.

48:35.454 --> 48:37.081
Thank you.

48:45.381 --> 48:46.799
Good morning, Mr. President.

48:46.966 --> 48:49.927
- How you getting along?
- You're up early, lyndon.

48:51.345 --> 48:55.307
No, the president hasn't arrived yet,
but what do you need?

48:58.436 --> 49:00.396
It can wait.

49:00.938 --> 49:02.565
What's on your mind?

49:05.943 --> 49:11.031
I wanna know
the president's intentions for '64.

49:11.490 --> 49:14.952
Does he wanna keep me on the ticket?

49:16.120 --> 49:19.206
Dropping you from the ticket
would be more trouble than it's worth.

49:19.373 --> 49:21.500
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I was on my way.

49:22.334 --> 49:23.377
Bobby.

49:28.424 --> 49:30.134
Why don't you like me?

49:31.469 --> 49:32.845
Your brother likes me.

49:33.012 --> 49:34.680
Your father likes me.

49:34.847 --> 49:37.224
What is it makes you hate me so much?

49:38.142 --> 49:40.978
I don't hate you. I just... I...

49:41.145 --> 49:43.063
We see the world in very different ways.

49:44.857 --> 49:46.817
Then why do you keep me around?

49:46.984 --> 49:49.361
I was in congress 24 years...

49:49.528 --> 49:53.365
But you never asked for my help
in legislative issues.

49:53.532 --> 49:55.159
I'm from the south...

49:55.326 --> 49:58.746
But when you need help down there,
you go to other southerners.

49:58.913 --> 50:01.332
Why don't you just...

50:01.499 --> 50:03.083
Put me out to pasture?

50:03.250 --> 50:07.922
You've worked overtime
making sure I'm politically through.

50:08.088 --> 50:11.509
I can never run for elected office again.

50:11.675 --> 50:16.639
Hell, I don't even know
if I can help the president out in '64.

50:23.604 --> 50:26.690
This isn't about '64, is it?

50:27.441 --> 50:28.984
[Nt]

50:29.235 --> 50:31.403
It's about '68.

50:32.363 --> 50:36.659
You don't wanna bring in someone new.
You keep me here precisely because...

50:36.825 --> 50:40.538
You've made me politically irrelevant.

50:41.622 --> 50:44.250
That way, in '68...

50:47.586 --> 50:51.465
The vice president isn't
the presumptive nominee.

50:51.632 --> 50:53.425
You are.

50:55.219 --> 50:57.263
You think I'd be that calculating?

50:58.138 --> 51:00.266
I know I would be.

51:00.474 --> 51:02.476
[Nt]

51:26.458 --> 51:30.212
If either of you get a betterjob offer,
I suggest you take it.

51:30.379 --> 51:33.048
My future is behind me.

51:37.761 --> 51:40.139
[Nt]

51:56.280 --> 51:57.656
He's gone.

52:19.470 --> 52:21.138
Mr. President?

52:42.868 --> 52:46.330
Sir, I need to announce
the death of president Kennedy.

52:47.956 --> 52:50.834
Ahem. I want you to hold off
on that, Malcolm.

52:51.001 --> 52:54.588
Rufus, get some cars set up and let
the drivers know we're ready to move.

52:54.755 --> 52:58.717
Emery, have your people
locate luci and Lynda bird.

52:58.884 --> 53:01.762
I want my daughters to meet us
when we arrive in Washington.

53:01.929 --> 53:06.517
Also, have McNamara, rusk and the rest
of the cabinet on the ground at Andrews.

53:06.684 --> 53:09.019
Rusk and five cabinet members
are on a plane to Japan.

53:09.186 --> 53:11.188
Turn it around.

53:11.355 --> 53:14.024
I need you to tell Mrs. Kennedy
it's time to go.

53:14.191 --> 53:15.901
Mrs. Kennedy won't leave
without the body.

53:16.068 --> 53:18.612
Well, we won't leave here
without Mrs. Kennedy.

53:18.779 --> 53:21.824
- Sir, we need to get you in the air.
- Not without Jackie.

53:21.990 --> 53:24.702
- Then let's wait for her at the plane.
- Fine.

53:24.868 --> 53:27.287
Cliff, I need people I know close by.

53:28.122 --> 53:30.874
Congressmen, I want you
flying back to Washington with me.

53:31.041 --> 53:32.751
-Yes, sir. Kilduff: Sir...

53:32.918 --> 53:36.588
The American people need to know
that president Kennedy has died.

53:39.800 --> 53:42.052
On April 14th, 1865...

53:42.219 --> 53:45.472
Two men attempted to kill
secretary of state William seward...

53:45.639 --> 53:47.725
Stabbing him in his home.

53:47.891 --> 53:50.269
At the same time,
another assassin was on his way...

53:50.436 --> 53:53.647
To take the life
of vice president Andrew Johnson.

53:53.814 --> 53:55.899
This was the same night...

53:56.066 --> 53:58.485
That John wilkes booth
shot Abraham Lincoln.

53:58.652 --> 54:03.824
We don't know the extent
of this conspiracy or who's behind it.

54:03.991 --> 54:06.702
Malcolm, you're to announce
president Kennedy's death...

54:06.869 --> 54:09.705
Only after the rest of us
are safely on board that plane.

54:09.872 --> 54:12.291
Otherwise, you're gonna make
these boys' jobs...

54:12.458 --> 54:14.626
A whole hell of a lot harder.
Youngblood: Sir.

54:21.008 --> 54:23.844
[Chattering indistinctly]

54:33.896 --> 54:36.148
It was only on October the 24th...

54:36.315 --> 54:39.526
That our ambassador
to the United Nations, adlai Stevenson...

54:39.693 --> 54:43.697
Was assaulted in Dallas,
leaving a dinner meeting there.

54:46.366 --> 54:49.828
From Dallas, Texas,
the flash, apparently official...

54:49.995 --> 54:55.000
President Kennedy died
at 1 pm. Central standard time...

54:55.667 --> 54:58.754
2 o'clock eastern standard time...

54:58.921 --> 55:01.507
Some 38 minutes ago.

55:03.133 --> 55:04.927
[Nt]

55:06.136 --> 55:10.265
Vice president lyndon Johnson
has left the hospital in Dallas...

55:10.432 --> 55:14.019
But we do not know
to where he has proceeded.

55:14.186 --> 55:17.856
Presumably, he will be taking
the oath of office shortly...

55:18.023 --> 55:23.195
And become the 36th president
of the United States.

55:23.695 --> 55:26.406
Johnson: I wanna thank everybody
for getting here so quickly.

55:26.573 --> 55:30.786
And I'm gonna need your help
back in Washington.

55:30.953 --> 55:33.497
- Marie, can you join me in the next room?
- Yes, sir.

55:33.664 --> 55:35.165
- Excuse me.
- At Dallas airport...

55:35.332 --> 55:38.335
Was cheerful, waving...

55:41.505 --> 55:43.382
[Nt]

56:02.192 --> 56:04.361
This is lyndon Johnson.

56:06.738 --> 56:09.074
I need you to take notes.

56:10.492 --> 56:12.953
Guthman: Sir, I got lyndon Johnson
on the phone.

56:18.959 --> 56:20.002
Hello, lyndon.

56:21.128 --> 56:23.422
Bobby, I am...

56:23.589 --> 56:26.300
So sorry for your loss.

56:26.967 --> 56:28.635
Words cannot express...

56:28.802 --> 56:31.263
The whole country mourns with you.

56:32.306 --> 56:34.558
- Thank you.
- Listen, Bobby...

56:34.725 --> 56:37.728
I need your opinion about something.

56:37.895 --> 56:40.522
People down here are saying that I...

56:40.689 --> 56:44.359
I should take the oath of office
as soon as possible...

56:44.776 --> 56:46.695
Before we depart.

56:46.862 --> 56:49.114
What do you think about that?

56:50.282 --> 56:52.784
Well, I think it would be nice
for president Kennedy...

56:52.951 --> 56:54.912
To return to Washington as president.

56:55.746 --> 56:59.416
Well, I understand that. I do.

56:59.583 --> 57:03.337
But we got confusion down here,
and it's liable to turn into panic.

57:03.503 --> 57:06.673
I think it would put
a lot of people at ease...

57:06.840 --> 57:11.553
If I was to take the oath right now.

57:12.638 --> 57:14.973
What's the matter?
You afraid you'll arrive...

57:15.140 --> 57:17.059
And the white house won't be here?

57:17.893 --> 57:20.604
I think it's important
that the world knows...

57:20.771 --> 57:25.359
That the American government is
functioning and someone's in charge.

57:25.525 --> 57:27.611
Well, I don't know what the hurry is...

57:27.778 --> 57:30.739
But if you're so insistent
on taking the oath, take the oath.

57:31.198 --> 57:34.201
Okay, Bobby, then I'll take the oath.

57:34.368 --> 57:35.410
Fine, lyndon.

57:35.577 --> 57:38.205
Now, we have
to be absolutely certain that...

57:38.372 --> 57:39.748
We do this the right way.

57:39.915 --> 57:43.168
So I need you to get me
the precise wording.

57:43.669 --> 57:46.880
- Is that all?
- One last thing.

57:47.047 --> 57:48.757
Who do we need to administer it?

57:49.174 --> 57:50.425
Any judge can do it.

57:50.842 --> 57:52.719
Okay, well, thank you, Bobby.

57:52.886 --> 57:54.596
God bless.

57:55.973 --> 57:57.391
Get me Sarah Hughes.

57:58.183 --> 57:59.893
I do solemnly swear...

58:00.060 --> 58:01.395
I do solemnly swear...

58:01.561 --> 58:03.605
That I will faithfully execute...

58:03.772 --> 58:05.983
That I will faithfully execute...

58:06.149 --> 58:08.443
The office of president
of the United States...

58:08.944 --> 58:11.363
The office of president
of the United States...

58:11.530 --> 58:14.574
And will, to the best of my ability...

58:14.741 --> 58:17.411
And will, to the best of my ability...

58:17.577 --> 58:20.038
- Preserve, protect...
- Preserve, protect...

58:20.205 --> 58:22.082
- And defend...
- And defend...

58:22.249 --> 58:25.210
The constitution of the United States.

58:25.377 --> 58:28.922
- The constitution of the United States.
- 80 help me god.

58:29.965 --> 58:32.009
80 help me god.

58:33.468 --> 58:34.928
[Rm]

58:35.178 --> 58:38.724
Newscaster [on radio]: At 3:39 pm,
the machinery of our government...

58:38.890 --> 58:41.977
Conferred the unique powers
and awesome responsibilities...

58:42.144 --> 58:45.689
Of the presidency
upon lyndon baines Johnson.

58:45.856 --> 58:50.235
There is, in the urgent necessity
of this continuity of presidential power...

58:50.402 --> 58:53.030
A reassurance
that the government will function...

58:53.196 --> 58:56.783
The nation endure,
no matter how great the tragedy...

58:56.950 --> 58:58.869
No matter how grievous the shock.

58:59.036 --> 59:00.412
Welcome back, sir.

59:00.579 --> 59:02.998
- Mrs. Johnson.
- Glad you're safe, sir.

59:03.165 --> 59:06.293
Early reports said you'd been shot
or that you'd had a heart attack.

59:06.460 --> 59:09.046
Agent youngblood
took excellent care of us.

59:09.212 --> 59:10.255
- Bird?
- Yes?

59:10.422 --> 59:14.176
Can you get your good stationery? I'd like
to write letters to Caroline and John.

59:14.342 --> 59:15.635
- Juanita.
- Yes, sir?

59:15.802 --> 59:18.638
- Come with me. I need to make calls.
- Yes, sir.

59:19.139 --> 59:22.934
Yes, it has been a shocking day.

59:23.977 --> 59:25.979
Well, I...

59:26.938 --> 59:29.900
You know,
I feel inadequate to the task.

59:30.067 --> 59:33.987
And I'm gonna be relying
on your good, sound judgment.

59:34.154 --> 59:35.655
And...

59:36.490 --> 59:37.657
[Sighs]

59:38.241 --> 59:39.326
[Clears throat]

59:39.493 --> 59:41.703
I'll be calling on you...

59:41.870 --> 59:44.206
To get your advice.

59:44.372 --> 59:48.251
You know how much
I've admired you over the years.

59:48.710 --> 59:52.255
Well, please give my love
to Mrs. Eisenhower.

59:52.422 --> 59:53.507
No, no, no.

59:53.673 --> 59:57.052
Anything Harry Truman has to say,
I'm all ears.

59:57.219 --> 59:59.846
I'm gonna be calling on you real soon.

01:00:00.013 --> 01:00:03.350
J. Edgar, you are not just
the head of the federal bureau...

01:00:03.517 --> 01:00:05.852
You're as close
as "close" can be to me.

01:00:06.019 --> 01:00:10.524
Now, let's just try to put
our country at close ranks...

01:00:10.690 --> 01:00:15.445
And pull ourselves out of this
terrible situation we find ourselves in.

01:00:15.612 --> 01:00:18.990
Nellie, how's our boy?
Is he in a lot of pain?

01:00:19.449 --> 01:00:21.243
Well, tell John I'm praying for him...

01:00:21.409 --> 01:00:25.247
And bird and I are sending you both
a big hug and a kiss.

01:00:25.413 --> 01:00:28.333
Pierre, it makes no sense
to be jumping ship now...

01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:30.544
When we're all
on the same fucking ocean.

01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:32.462
[Whispers]
I'm going to bed, dear.

01:00:32.629 --> 01:00:33.922
Okay, baby.

01:00:34.089 --> 01:00:37.300
Now, I need you now
more than he ever did.

01:00:38.009 --> 01:00:41.721
Johnson: Lady bird and I will remain
at the elms for the foreseeable future.

01:00:41.888 --> 01:00:44.850
And Jackie can stay at the white house
for as long as she likes.

01:00:45.016 --> 01:00:48.645
George: Bundy said you and your staff
should move to the oval office tomorrow.

01:00:48.812 --> 01:00:50.272
Johnson: Fine.

01:00:50.438 --> 01:00:52.149
Ted sorensen?

01:00:52.315 --> 01:00:53.942
It's lyndon Johnson.

01:00:54.943 --> 01:00:56.361
Hello, Mr. President.

01:00:56.528 --> 01:00:58.029
I'm glad I tracked you down.

01:00:58.196 --> 01:01:01.241
Sir, senator Russell's
pulled up to the house.

01:01:02.909 --> 01:01:06.413
Listen, I know how much
you loved president Kennedy.

01:01:07.164 --> 01:01:08.540
And he loved you too.

01:01:08.707 --> 01:01:11.543
You were a trusted servant,
loyal to the end.

01:01:13.003 --> 01:01:16.840
Ted, I need you now
more than he ever did.

01:01:17.007 --> 01:01:19.217
How many senators
did Russell bring with him?

01:01:19.384 --> 01:01:21.428
Looks like the entire southern delegation.

01:01:21.595 --> 01:01:23.013
Any idea what they want?

01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:25.682
Russell said they just wanted
to wish you well.

01:01:25.849 --> 01:01:28.977
No. They could've done that
over the phone.

01:01:30.437 --> 01:01:32.022
[Applause]

01:01:37.944 --> 01:01:39.946
Mr. President.

01:01:42.532 --> 01:01:44.201
Mr. President.

01:01:45.035 --> 01:01:47.162
In this dark hour
of our nation's history...

01:01:47.329 --> 01:01:49.915
We must remember
to give thanks for our blessings.

01:01:51.291 --> 01:01:56.296
Because out of the despicable ashes
of a presidential assassination...

01:01:58.798 --> 01:02:01.468
A new leader has emerged.

01:02:01.635 --> 01:02:04.679
And we're all here to offer our support.

01:02:04.846 --> 01:02:06.181
Man: Yes, sir.

01:02:06.348 --> 01:02:11.061
After a century of persecution,
a century of being treated as inferior...

01:02:11.228 --> 01:02:14.022
After 100 long years...

01:02:14.189 --> 01:02:16.733
We finally have one of our own
leading this nation.

01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:21.321
America has a southern president.

01:02:22.739 --> 01:02:25.951
And we could think
of no finer representative for our people.

01:02:28.745 --> 01:02:29.871
Dear lord...

01:02:31.248 --> 01:02:34.334
Continue to watch over our president...

01:02:34.501 --> 01:02:37.545
And fill him with the strength...

01:02:37.712 --> 01:02:41.841
And wisdom as he works to do
the same for all your children.

01:02:42.676 --> 01:02:44.427
-Amen. All: Amen.

01:02:47.138 --> 01:02:48.932
Thank you, dick. Gentlemen.

01:02:55.689 --> 01:02:57.107
Johnson:
Good morning, gentlemen.

01:02:57.274 --> 01:02:58.876
O'brien: Mr. President.
O'Donnell: Mr. President.

01:02:58.900 --> 01:03:01.403
I'm pleased to see you
back at work already.

01:03:02.028 --> 01:03:05.615
The constitution put me
in the white house...

01:03:05.782 --> 01:03:10.078
But there's no law
to make you stay here with me.

01:03:11.746 --> 01:03:15.625
Now, I know you loved
president Kennedy...

01:03:15.792 --> 01:03:19.629
But I need you now
more than he ever did.

01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:23.258
Not that I loved Caesar less...

01:03:23.425 --> 01:03:26.094
But that I loved Rome more.

01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:36.187
- I can't believe he quoted Shakespeare.
- Can't believe he quoted brutus.

01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:38.523
Johnson:
Good morning, Mrs. Lincoln.

01:03:38.898 --> 01:03:40.608
Good morning.

01:03:41.735 --> 01:03:44.237
Now, I have an 11:30 appointment.

01:03:44.404 --> 01:03:46.781
Can I get my girls
in the office by then?

01:03:48.158 --> 01:03:50.076
I'll do the best I can.

01:03:52.412 --> 01:03:54.414
I know you will.

01:04:13.683 --> 01:04:16.144
Walter: Mrs. Kennedy
had the new carpet installed...

01:04:16.311 --> 01:04:17.645
When everybody went to Texas.

01:04:19.481 --> 01:04:22.108
Oh. Strange choice.

01:04:25.570 --> 01:04:27.489
What's going on?

01:04:28.823 --> 01:04:29.949
[Clears throat]

01:04:30.617 --> 01:04:35.705
Mr. Johnson told me
to clear everything out immediately.

01:04:40.502 --> 01:04:42.837
You don't waste any time,
do you, lyndon?

01:04:43.004 --> 01:04:45.423
- Excuse me?
- It's going to take some doing to get...

01:04:45.590 --> 01:04:48.885
All of president Kennedy's
belongings packed and relocated.

01:04:49.511 --> 01:04:51.638
I was told to use this office.

01:04:51.805 --> 01:04:54.641
Just like you were told
to take the oath in Dallas?

01:04:56.309 --> 01:04:57.727
[Whispering] Bobby...

01:04:57.894 --> 01:05:00.230
I'm not trying
to shove myself anywhere.

01:05:00.397 --> 01:05:04.484
In fact, I told Jackie she could stay
in the east wing as long as she needs.

01:05:04.651 --> 01:05:08.530
Well, that's not really the part of the
building that you're interested in, is it?

01:05:09.114 --> 01:05:11.574
I'm just trying to do my job.

01:05:11.991 --> 01:05:16.162
My brother's coffin is down the hall.
This is not where our attention should be.

01:05:20.667 --> 01:05:23.962
We all mourn for your brother.

01:05:24.129 --> 01:05:27.590
But somebody has to tend
to the business of the country.

01:05:27.757 --> 01:05:30.677
Mourning for my brother is
the business of the country.

01:05:33.346 --> 01:05:35.765
We can come back later
after my cabinet meeting.

01:05:36.391 --> 01:05:38.226
Your cabinet...

01:05:45.942 --> 01:05:47.527
Bobby...

01:05:47.694 --> 01:05:49.863
I know you've got a lot on your mind.

01:05:51.030 --> 01:05:54.117
But I want you to stand with me
as Attorney General.

01:05:54.617 --> 01:05:58.121
You've already got one photograph
with a grieving Kennedy at your side.

01:05:58.288 --> 01:05:59.706
Do you really need another?

01:06:00.999 --> 01:06:03.084
[Rm]

01:06:04.544 --> 01:06:07.213
I'd appreciate it if you kept me
apprised of any...

01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:09.007
Change in plans you might have.

01:06:09.174 --> 01:06:10.675
Okay.

01:06:10.842 --> 01:06:12.594
Yeah, I know where to find you.

01:06:18.183 --> 01:06:20.185
[Rm]

01:06:28.359 --> 01:06:32.822
Cronkite: People gathered outside
the grounds of the white house today...

01:06:32.989 --> 01:06:36.367
Watching the dignitaries
and government officials...

01:06:36.534 --> 01:06:38.703
And representatives
of foreign governments...

01:06:38.870 --> 01:06:41.998
Come through the gates
and go to pay last respects...

01:06:42.165 --> 01:06:46.044
To president Kennedy, lying in
the east room of the white house.

01:06:46.211 --> 01:06:50.298
Our reporter, David schumacher,
was outside the white house...

01:06:50.465 --> 01:06:54.177
And talked to some of those people.
Let's look at that film now.

01:06:54.344 --> 01:06:59.390
Just word... just... I just can't describe
just how I feel at this time.

01:06:59.557 --> 01:07:00.975
It just seems empty.

01:07:01.142 --> 01:07:05.522
It just doesn't seem like anybody else
could fill the place the way he did.

01:07:05.897 --> 01:07:08.149
Sir, we need to discuss
your address to congress.

01:07:08.316 --> 01:07:10.401
Man: It's unreal.
This can't happen in our country.

01:07:10.568 --> 01:07:13.071
Woman:
I feel the profound grief that...

01:07:13.238 --> 01:07:15.740
I'm not ready for that yet.

01:07:16.866 --> 01:07:19.536
Walter: Well, with all due respect,
you better get ready.

01:07:19.702 --> 01:07:22.205
President Kennedy's burial
has been set for Monday.

01:07:22.372 --> 01:07:25.041
Thursday being Thanksgiving,
we don't have much of a window.

01:07:25.208 --> 01:07:29.837
Thinking that, possibly,
the only thing we could do is to...

01:07:30.004 --> 01:07:33.800
Pray that lyndon Johnson
can carry on.

01:07:35.885 --> 01:07:39.013
Johnson gave Pierre the "I need
you more than he needed you" speech.

01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:40.223
What did you tell him?

01:07:40.390 --> 01:07:43.351
Salinger: I told him I'd stay as press
secretary as long as he needed me.

01:07:43.851 --> 01:07:44.936
Till Tuesday.

01:07:45.103 --> 01:07:46.312
[All laugh]

01:07:46.479 --> 01:07:49.774
Johnson's not gonna be satisfied till
every one of us promises to serve him.

01:07:49.941 --> 01:07:51.526
So, what are we doing here?

01:07:52.777 --> 01:07:54.862
Schlesinger:
In his inaugural address...

01:07:55.029 --> 01:07:56.990
President Kennedy declared that...

01:07:57.156 --> 01:08:01.119
The torch had been passed
to a new generation ofamericans.

01:08:01.286 --> 01:08:03.538
The question before us now is:

01:08:03.705 --> 01:08:05.832
Who should be the custodian
of that torch?

01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:07.083
[Rm]

01:08:07.250 --> 01:08:09.836
The constitution may say
that the vice president...

01:08:10.003 --> 01:08:14.257
Is the next in the line of succession,
but does anyone here believe...

01:08:14.424 --> 01:08:18.303
That lyndon Johnson is
the man to carry that torch?

01:08:18.845 --> 01:08:20.846
O'brien:
So, what are you suggesting?

01:08:21.014 --> 01:08:23.515
I didn't come to Washington
just to work for John Kennedy.

01:08:24.142 --> 01:08:26.978
I came here to work
for what John Kennedy believed in.

01:08:28.062 --> 01:08:29.689
There is unfinished business.

01:08:30.023 --> 01:08:33.234
Right now our only hope of completing it
is by serving his successor.

01:08:33.401 --> 01:08:35.194
Man 1:
That's not true. There are other ways.

01:08:35.361 --> 01:08:37.529
O'brien: We've come too far
to put everything on hold.

01:08:37.697 --> 01:08:41.367
So you think that Johnson will continue
the work of president Kennedy?

01:08:42.035 --> 01:08:45.912
This is a man who has fought against
every piece of civil rights legislation...

01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:48.374
For the last 20 years.

01:08:48.541 --> 01:08:50.667
How do you honor Kennedy
by working for Johnson?

01:08:50.835 --> 01:08:52.127
You're looking at it wrong.

01:08:52.295 --> 01:08:56.174
Even if Johnson believed in what
we believe in, and that is up for debate...

01:08:56.341 --> 01:08:58.421
How much do you think
he'd accomplish in one year?

01:08:58.551 --> 01:08:59.636
Man 2: Good point.

01:08:59.801 --> 01:09:01.679
Galbraith:
Could we mount a campaign by then?

01:09:01.845 --> 01:09:05.265
Salinger: Bobby is more powerful and
more popular than any other democrat...

01:09:05.433 --> 01:09:07.060
Including lyndon Johnson.

01:09:07.225 --> 01:09:10.729
The men in this room all want to see
a president, a president Kennedy...

01:09:10.897 --> 01:09:14.359
Deliver this world to a better place.
So do the people of this country.

01:09:14.524 --> 01:09:15.526
O'Donnell: Hear, hear.

01:09:15.693 --> 01:09:18.363
Sorenson: What are you
asking us to do? Quit?

01:09:18.529 --> 01:09:20.281
- Betra y lyndon Johnson?
- O'Donnell: No.

01:09:20.448 --> 01:09:22.950
No, no, no. No one is being asked
to sabotage anything.

01:09:23.117 --> 01:09:27.162
No one is calling for a mass exodus,
and this certainly is not a coup d'Ã©tat.

01:09:28.956 --> 01:09:31.501
Johnson needs to make his case
to the American people.

01:09:31.667 --> 01:09:34.252
He needs to prove
that he's worthy of this job.

01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:36.756
And if he stumbles...

01:09:38.091 --> 01:09:39.550
If he should fall...

01:09:40.968 --> 01:09:43.429
We need to be prepared
to challenge him.

01:09:44.805 --> 01:09:46.432
And it will be Bobby's time.

01:09:53.523 --> 01:09:56.150
George: We can't just sweep
the rest of the agenda under the rug.

01:09:56.317 --> 01:09:59.445
Fortas: Yes. He has to make
some progress on civil rights.

01:09:59.612 --> 01:10:02.615
George: Some. We need to be realistic.
Johnson: Howdy, Zephyr.

01:10:02.782 --> 01:10:04.617
- Evening, sir.
- Walter: Good evening, sir.

01:10:04.784 --> 01:10:07.745
Hear anything back
from the Kennedy men?

01:10:07.912 --> 01:10:10.707
Well, two nights ago,
they had a meeting...

01:10:10.873 --> 01:10:15.294
And I... I think we're gonna
hear something soon.

01:10:15.795 --> 01:10:17.964
How they going in there?

01:10:18.798 --> 01:10:20.550
It's going.

01:10:20.717 --> 01:10:23.177
Humphrey: We can't just keep doing
the same thing.

01:10:23.344 --> 01:10:26.222
George: The best thing we can do is
show some progress in civil rights.

01:10:26.389 --> 01:10:28.391
Humphrey:
"Some progress" is not enough.

01:10:28.558 --> 01:10:31.561
The civil rights bill was the cornerstone
of Kennedy's presidency.

01:10:31.728 --> 01:10:33.646
Even Kennedy was gonna have
to compromise.

01:10:33.813 --> 01:10:35.106
Exactly.

01:10:35.273 --> 01:10:38.234
And nobody expects Johnson
to be John Kennedy.

01:10:40.695 --> 01:10:43.030
[Rm]

01:11:30.495 --> 01:11:33.414
Do our daughters know I love them?

01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:36.876
Of course they do, lyndon. Why?

01:11:39.212 --> 01:11:41.464
I didn't always know.

01:11:41.923 --> 01:11:44.300
Rebekah loved you.

01:11:47.136 --> 01:11:49.514
Some days, she...

01:11:51.265 --> 01:11:54.685
Made me feel like a prince, but...

01:11:57.146 --> 01:11:59.273
Some days...

01:12:02.151 --> 01:12:03.736
Lyndon.

01:12:03.903 --> 01:12:05.154
Honey?

01:12:05.321 --> 01:12:07.907
You're not supposed to have that.

01:12:10.618 --> 01:12:12.286
[Grunts]

01:12:13.538 --> 01:12:16.123
Now, what's this all about?

01:12:21.796 --> 01:12:23.965
From the time I was a boy, I...

01:12:24.131 --> 01:12:26.551
I had this dream...

01:12:32.598 --> 01:12:35.643
I'd rather not have it
than have it this way.

01:12:36.936 --> 01:12:39.939
Oh, my poor darling.

01:12:45.862 --> 01:12:48.739
They don't... they want...

01:12:49.824 --> 01:12:51.701
They want Jack. They love Jack.

01:12:51.868 --> 01:12:54.662
They love Bobby. They...

01:12:56.330 --> 01:12:58.624
They don't even like me.

01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:08.926
Lyndon...

01:13:09.260 --> 01:13:13.890
Your mother didn't turn her back on you
because she didn't love you.

01:13:14.891 --> 01:13:18.978
She just couldn't stand to see you
when you weren't at your best.

01:13:21.689 --> 01:13:24.525
She wouldn't wanna see me now.

01:13:36.954 --> 01:13:39.415
Lady bird:
You're gonna be all right

01:13:39.749 --> 01:13:43.294
you're a good man in a tight spot

01:13:44.545 --> 01:13:48.674
president Kennedy did
wonderful things for america.

01:13:48.841 --> 01:13:54.221
Not the least of which was choosing you
to be his successor.

01:13:56.641 --> 01:13:59.810
He was a man of great ideas.

01:14:00.519 --> 01:14:03.314
Now the country needs a man...

01:14:03.481 --> 01:14:05.608
Who can deliver.

01:14:12.198 --> 01:14:15.076
Valenti: If we don't do anything
about civil rights...

01:14:15.242 --> 01:14:17.828
We'll face a challenge
at the convention.

01:14:17.995 --> 01:14:19.997
- From Bobby?
- From someone.

01:14:20.164 --> 01:14:21.415
Valenti: The question is:

01:14:21.582 --> 01:14:24.961
What's the minimum we need
to accomplish in order to win reelection?

01:14:25.127 --> 01:14:28.214
Which provisions in Kennedy's bill
can we live without?

01:14:28.381 --> 01:14:30.758
Are you saying weaken the bill
right out of the gate?

01:14:30.925 --> 01:14:33.970
We can't risk everything
chasing ambitious goals.

01:14:34.136 --> 01:14:36.180
Then what the hell's the presidency for?

01:14:42.269 --> 01:14:45.314
It can't be about a shiny airplane
or a room with no corners.

01:14:45.481 --> 01:14:49.026
Surely, we can aspire
to something greater.

01:14:49.193 --> 01:14:51.445
You wanna back
Kennedy's civil rights bill?

01:14:51.612 --> 01:14:54.115
The entire goddamn thing.

01:14:54.907 --> 01:14:56.867
Are you even in favor of it?

01:15:02.248 --> 01:15:03.958
You know, about a...

01:15:04.417 --> 01:15:06.293
Year ago...

01:15:06.460 --> 01:15:10.423
My private cook Mrs. Wright,
who you know...

01:15:10.589 --> 01:15:14.593
Was driving from here
down to the ranch in Texas.

01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:17.847
So I asked her if she would mind...

01:15:18.014 --> 01:15:21.350
Bringing my dog,
little beagle Johnson, with her...

01:15:22.018 --> 01:15:25.730
In order that he could be there
when I got home.

01:15:25.896 --> 01:15:29.650
Mrs. Wright respectfully declined.

01:15:29.817 --> 01:15:31.777
She said it is hard enough...

01:15:31.944 --> 01:15:34.864
For a black woman driving
through the south...

01:15:35.031 --> 01:15:37.450
Without having a dog to worry about.

01:15:37.992 --> 01:15:42.329
Finding a place to eat,
to sleep, to use the restroom.

01:15:42.496 --> 01:15:47.752
The personal cook of the vice president
of the United States...

01:15:47.918 --> 01:15:51.338
Has to drive through towns
without stopping...

01:15:51.505 --> 01:15:55.259
Then squat to pee
by the side of the road.

01:15:56.552 --> 01:15:58.679
Hundred years ago,
she would've been a slave.

01:15:58.846 --> 01:16:03.559
Hundred years from now, hell,
she might be president.

01:16:03.768 --> 01:16:04.810
[Rm]

01:16:04.977 --> 01:16:06.771
But today...

01:16:07.897 --> 01:16:11.817
We live in a time
of too much uncertainty.

01:16:11.984 --> 01:16:14.737
Where can she eat?
Where can she sleep?

01:16:14.904 --> 01:16:16.030
Can she vote?

01:16:16.197 --> 01:16:19.241
And if she does, will she be harassed
for casting that vote?

01:16:19.408 --> 01:16:22.369
Can she attend school?
If so, which school?

01:16:22.536 --> 01:16:26.540
Can she travel the cities
and towns of this land...

01:16:26.707 --> 01:16:30.252
Without fearing for her safety?

01:16:31.295 --> 01:16:35.841
What rights that belong
to the men in this room...

01:16:36.008 --> 01:16:38.511
Should not be afforded to her?

01:16:38.677 --> 01:16:42.473
Sir, you're gonna lose the support of
the people who've always had your back.

01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:47.019
And if you aren't successful, you're never
gonna earn the support of anyone else.

01:16:47.186 --> 01:16:51.232
Four other presidents have fought
congress on this and failed.

01:16:57.238 --> 01:16:59.990
There will be no compromise.

01:17:00.157 --> 01:17:02.618
There will be no negotiation.

01:17:02.785 --> 01:17:05.704
And there will be no failure.

01:17:05.871 --> 01:17:08.666
This time,
congress is not fighting a president.

01:17:08.833 --> 01:17:10.668
It's fighting two.

01:17:10.835 --> 01:17:14.046
Never underestimate
the intensity of a martyr's cause...

01:17:14.213 --> 01:17:19.593
Or the size of a texan's balls.

01:17:23.222 --> 01:17:24.932
[Chattering indistinctly]

01:17:29.103 --> 01:17:30.604
Good morning, Mr. President.

01:17:31.188 --> 01:17:33.149
Good morning, juanita.

01:17:37.695 --> 01:17:40.114
[Rm]

01:18:52.561 --> 01:18:57.066
Ted, we have scheduled a speech before
a joint session of congress tomorrow.

01:18:57.775 --> 01:18:59.151
I've heard.

01:18:59.318 --> 01:19:01.028
I'd like you to write it.

01:19:01.195 --> 01:19:02.446
Mr. President...

01:19:02.905 --> 01:19:05.783
I don't know
that I'll be coming back to work.

01:19:13.916 --> 01:19:15.459
Ted...

01:19:18.754 --> 01:19:23.092
The voice of John Kennedy rings
throughout our land.

01:19:23.259 --> 01:19:26.887
You gave words to that voice.

01:19:27.054 --> 01:19:29.056
I need those words now.

01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:30.766
Mr. President, I...

01:19:30.933 --> 01:19:34.937
We are moving ahead full tilt
with his civil rights bill.

01:19:35.104 --> 01:19:37.773
His entire agenda.

01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:42.152
This is about making
president Kennedy's vision...

01:19:42.319 --> 01:19:44.029
A reality.

01:19:51.245 --> 01:19:53.289
Just checking to see
if you need anything.

01:19:53.455 --> 01:19:55.624
I don't understand
what you want this to be.

01:19:55.791 --> 01:19:57.293
Is it supposed to be a speech...

01:19:57.459 --> 01:19:59.003
- Or a eulogy...?
- Both.

01:19:59.378 --> 01:20:01.672
A country's final goodbye
to president Kennedy...

01:20:01.839 --> 01:20:04.383
And its first introduction
to president Johnson.

01:20:04.550 --> 01:20:06.552
It's a eulogy,
it's an opening statement...

01:20:06.719 --> 01:20:09.888
It's a state of the union,
it's an inaugural address.

01:20:10.055 --> 01:20:12.891
And you have less
than 21 hours to write it

01:20:14.601 --> 01:20:16.854
do you really believe
he can accomplish all this?

01:20:17.396 --> 01:20:18.564
I do.

01:20:18.731 --> 01:20:20.107
How can he?

01:20:20.274 --> 01:20:22.359
The same way he always has.

01:20:22.526 --> 01:20:27.489
You are as worthless as porkless pig.
Now get me the goddamn list!

01:20:27.656 --> 01:20:30.242
Senator dirksen's office
said he can stop by.

01:20:30.409 --> 01:20:32.494
- I'll go to him.
- McNamara: Mr. President...

01:20:32.661 --> 01:20:34.705
I need to know
your thinking on Vietnam.

01:20:34.872 --> 01:20:38.167
My thinking on Vietnam is that
I don't wanna think about Vietnam.

01:20:39.626 --> 01:20:43.339
You stayed on the line to wait for me
to hang up on you?

01:20:44.298 --> 01:20:47.718
- Rusk needs 10 minutes.
- He can have them in 20.

01:20:47.885 --> 01:20:50.846
- There's gonna be a southern filibuster.
- What's the count on cloture?

01:20:51.013 --> 01:20:53.891
- About 56.
- You can leave about now.

01:20:55.642 --> 01:20:57.061
Trust me, Bob.

01:20:57.227 --> 01:21:02.649
I am not gonna be the president to let
Southeast Asia fall to the communists.

01:21:02.816 --> 01:21:06.153
When I ask for a number,
I need a goddamn number.

01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:10.574
Senator dirksen,
this civil rights bill will have its day.

01:21:10.741 --> 01:21:12.785
Oh, it's gonna have more than its day, sir.

01:21:12.951 --> 01:21:15.371
There's going to be all-out war,
and I need men.

01:21:15.537 --> 01:21:17.915
Men with principle.

01:21:18.082 --> 01:21:20.918
Because the southerners in my party,
most of them anyway...

01:21:21.085 --> 01:21:23.670
Are gonna rise up against us.

01:21:23.837 --> 01:21:26.507
Now, senator yarborough,
are you up for that?

01:21:26.673 --> 01:21:30.177
It is my sincere hope
that the Republicans...

01:21:30.344 --> 01:21:32.513
The party of Lincoln...

01:21:32.679 --> 01:21:34.473
Fire the final shot.

01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:36.934
Sir, I serve at your pleasure.

01:21:39.728 --> 01:21:41.730
[Rm]

01:21:53.867 --> 01:21:57.413
This is your fucking mess
I'm cleaning up.

01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:05.003
Good to see you, dick.

01:22:06.130 --> 01:22:08.048
How you getting along?

01:22:09.758 --> 01:22:11.844
Why don't we have a drink?

01:22:15.139 --> 01:22:17.975
No, I... I think
I'm done drinking with you.

01:22:19.935 --> 01:22:22.771
You hurt the very people
who made you who you are.

01:22:22.938 --> 01:22:24.731
And for what?

01:22:25.274 --> 01:22:28.652
Civil rights is an idea
whose time has come.

01:22:28.819 --> 01:22:30.863
This will define your presidency.

01:22:32.030 --> 01:22:34.158
I can only hope.

01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:38.537
You're willing to hitch your wagon
to the outcome of this bill?

01:22:39.163 --> 01:22:44.042
We've been talking about this forever,
and we never say a damn thing.

01:22:44.209 --> 01:22:46.420
Well... what...?
What do you wanna say?

01:22:46.587 --> 01:22:48.380
That you're gonna turn
your back on me?

01:22:48.547 --> 01:22:50.966
That you don't care about
everything I've done for you?

01:22:51.133 --> 01:22:55.471
- That you're willing to betray me?
- That you're a racist.

01:22:57.097 --> 01:23:01.852
All your talk about the southern way of
life and loving the negra as your brother...

01:23:02.019 --> 01:23:06.732
And all the while, you plot against him
like he is a sworn enemy.

01:23:06.899 --> 01:23:08.567
I don't care where we're standing.

01:23:08.734 --> 01:23:10.819
No man is gonna talk to me like that.

01:23:10.986 --> 01:23:13.238
You are a good man, dick.

01:23:13.405 --> 01:23:14.781
World-class.

01:23:14.948 --> 01:23:18.118
I admire you more than any man alive.

01:23:18.285 --> 01:23:21.163
But you are wrong on this.
You are just plain wrong.

01:23:22.206 --> 01:23:25.626
I'm gonna fight you
with everything that I have.

01:23:25.792 --> 01:23:27.878
Fine. Fight me.

01:23:28.045 --> 01:23:29.505
But not in here.

01:23:29.671 --> 01:23:33.467
And not in backrooms
in hushed conversation.

01:23:33.634 --> 01:23:36.094
Fight me on the floor
of the United States senate...

01:23:36.261 --> 01:23:38.305
In front of the entire world.

01:23:38.472 --> 01:23:40.432
And on that battlefield...

01:23:40.599 --> 01:23:43.727
Let each man write his own legacy.

01:23:45.062 --> 01:23:47.564
[Rm]

01:24:07.125 --> 01:24:08.252
Time to go.

01:24:14.132 --> 01:24:16.134
[Rm]

01:24:28.313 --> 01:24:29.898
[Sighs]

01:24:36.196 --> 01:24:39.491
Try not to look at the southern caucus
when talking about civil rights.

01:24:39.658 --> 01:24:41.451
How will he know
where they're sitting?

01:24:41.618 --> 01:24:42.995
Don't worry. I'll spot them.

01:24:43.161 --> 01:24:45.747
They'll be the ones not clapping.

01:24:57.384 --> 01:24:59.386
Miller: Are you ready, sir?

01:25:10.314 --> 01:25:12.149
Mr. Speaker.

01:25:12.316 --> 01:25:15.611
The president of the United States.

01:25:15.777 --> 01:25:17.779
[Applause]

01:25:54.316 --> 01:25:55.776
Good, Mr. President.

01:25:56.193 --> 01:25:57.819
Mr. President.

01:26:07.329 --> 01:26:08.830
Mr. Speaker.

01:26:08.997 --> 01:26:10.957
Mr. President.

01:26:11.375 --> 01:26:14.086
Members of the house,
members of the senate...

01:26:14.544 --> 01:26:16.755
My fellow Americans.

01:26:21.093 --> 01:26:26.515
I would have given gladly
not to be standing here today.

01:26:28.016 --> 01:26:30.977
The greatest leader of our time...

01:26:31.144 --> 01:26:33.313
Has been struck down...

01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:37.317
By the foulest deed of our time.

01:26:37.776 --> 01:26:39.569
Today...

01:26:39.736 --> 01:26:43.198
John Fitzgerald Kennedy lives on.

01:26:44.157 --> 01:26:48.328
He lives on in the mind
and memories of mankind.

01:26:48.912 --> 01:26:53.208
He lives on in the hearts
of his countrymen.

01:26:53.875 --> 01:26:57.587
No words are sad enough...

01:26:58.213 --> 01:27:01.258
To express our sense of loss.

01:27:01.425 --> 01:27:04.845
No words are strong enough...

01:27:05.011 --> 01:27:08.223
To express our determination...

01:27:08.390 --> 01:27:10.225
To continue...

01:27:10.392 --> 01:27:12.686
The forward thrust...

01:27:12.853 --> 01:27:15.689
Of america that he began.

01:27:16.732 --> 01:27:21.403
An assassin's bullet
has thrust upon me...

01:27:21.570 --> 01:27:24.573
The awesome burden
of the presidency.

01:27:25.574 --> 01:27:27.909
And in this critical moment...

01:27:28.076 --> 01:27:29.745
It is our duty...

01:27:29.911 --> 01:27:32.414
Yours and mine...

01:27:32.581 --> 01:27:35.041
As the government
of the United States...

01:27:35.208 --> 01:27:40.338
To do away with uncertainty
and doubt and delay...

01:27:40.505 --> 01:27:45.135
And to show that we are capable
of decisive action.

01:27:45.510 --> 01:27:49.389
That from the brutal loss
of our leader...

01:27:50.056 --> 01:27:53.351
We will derive not weakness...

01:27:53.518 --> 01:27:55.020
But strength.

01:27:55.437 --> 01:28:01.067
John Kennedy's death commands
what his life conveyed:

01:28:01.234 --> 01:28:05.155
That america must move fonnard.

01:28:05.322 --> 01:28:07.949
The time has come...

01:28:08.116 --> 01:28:12.162
For Americans of all races and creeds...

01:28:12.662 --> 01:28:14.790
And political beliefs...

01:28:14.956 --> 01:28:17.167
To understand...

01:28:17.334 --> 01:28:19.419
And to respect one another.

01:28:19.878 --> 01:28:22.339
So let us put an end to the teaching...

01:28:22.506 --> 01:28:27.010
And the preaching of hate and evil...

01:28:27.177 --> 01:28:29.262
And violence.

01:28:29.846 --> 01:28:32.265
I profoundly hope...

01:28:32.432 --> 01:28:37.229
That the tragedy and the torment
of these terrible days...

01:28:37.395 --> 01:28:40.899
Will bind us together
in new fellowship...

01:28:41.066 --> 01:28:45.779
Making us one people
in our hour of sorrow.

01:28:45.946 --> 01:28:48.949
So let us, here, highly resolve...

01:28:49.115 --> 01:28:52.410
That John Fitzgerald Kennedy
did not live...

01:28:52.577 --> 01:28:55.914
Or die in vain.

01:28:56.498 --> 01:29:01.545
No memorial oration or eulogy
could more eloquently honor...

01:29:01.711 --> 01:29:04.047
President Kennedy's memory...

01:29:04.214 --> 01:29:08.802
Than the earliest possible passage
of the civil rights bill...

01:29:08.969 --> 01:29:11.429
For which he fought so long.

01:29:11.638 --> 01:29:13.223
[Rm]

01:29:13.390 --> 01:29:18.353
We have talked long enough
in this country about equal rights.

01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:22.607
We have talked for 100 years or more.

01:29:23.108 --> 01:29:26.820
It is time now to write
the next chapter...

01:29:26.987 --> 01:29:29.614
And to write it in the books of law.

01:29:39.666 --> 01:29:44.379
On the 20th day of January,
in 19 and 61...

01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:48.341
John F. Kennedy told his countrymen...

01:29:48.508 --> 01:29:50.802
That our national work...

01:29:50.969 --> 01:29:55.015
Would not be finished
in the first thousand days...

01:29:55.181 --> 01:29:57.809
Nor in the life of this administration.

01:29:58.852 --> 01:30:03.148
Nor even perhaps
in our lifetime on this planet.

01:30:05.901 --> 01:30:08.069
"Let us begin."

01:30:08.486 --> 01:30:09.905
Today...

01:30:10.071 --> 01:30:13.199
In this moment of new resolve...

01:30:13.366 --> 01:30:16.453
I would say
to all my fellow Americans:

01:30:17.203 --> 01:30:20.373
Let us continue.

01:30:21.541 --> 01:30:23.585
[Rm]

01:30:53.406 --> 01:30:56.534
Walter: Sir, we need to move beyond
civil rights and start thinking about...

01:30:56.701 --> 01:30:59.329
Whatever else it is that we aim to do.

01:30:59.704 --> 01:31:02.707
Well, if we've learned anything
from president Kennedy...

01:31:02.874 --> 01:31:07.545
It's that life is precious
and time is fleeting.

01:31:07.712 --> 01:31:10.590
And I don't intend to waste either.

01:31:11.132 --> 01:31:14.970
Mistakes will be made,
but inaction won't be one of them.

01:31:15.595 --> 01:31:18.723
John Kennedy gave people hope.

01:31:19.140 --> 01:31:23.186
Now we are gonna give them results.

01:31:24.479 --> 01:31:26.356
Let's get to work.

01:31:26.731 --> 01:31:29.109
- Walter: Thank you, Mr. President.
- Thank you.

01:31:29.275 --> 01:31:33.238
Sir, I have the request from McNamara.
Can I get your signature right there?

01:31:37.325 --> 01:31:40.328
Excuse me, Mr. President.
This is the brief...

01:31:41.246 --> 01:31:43.039
[Chattering indistinctly]

01:32:43.808 --> 01:32:47.771
[Rm]
