00:01.283 --> 00:03.395
Traditional "first day
of school" pancakes.

00:03.397 --> 00:06.498
- Whipped-cream smile?
- Dad, I'm in High School now.

00:06.498 --> 00:08.032
Just put it in my mouth.

00:08.475 --> 00:09.880
Okay, that's disgusting.
Stop it.

00:09.880 --> 00:11.393
Hey, save some of that
bossing people around

00:11.394 --> 00:12.822
for the office, lady.

00:13.649 --> 00:15.272
After a 20-year vacation,

00:15.273 --> 00:17.073
Claire is rejoining
the work force.

00:17.074 --> 00:17.751
Not a vacation.

00:17.751 --> 00:20.830
But I am starting a job
at my dad's closet company.

00:20.832 --> 00:22.630
He's kind of grooming me
to take over.

00:22.630 --> 00:24.043
I have a background in marketing.

00:24.043 --> 00:25.438
I'm so proud of her.

00:25.438 --> 00:28.020
Oh, uh, speaking of marketing --
we're out of milk.

00:29.085 --> 00:30.393
I'm actually kind of nervous.

00:30.395 --> 00:30.936
You're gonna be great.

00:30.938 --> 00:32.171
And remember,
if you get into a jam,

00:32.173 --> 00:34.136
just do the impression
I taught you.

00:34.137 --> 00:38.460
Hey. You can hang
your clothes in me.

00:38.462 --> 00:40.193
Christopher walk-in closet.

00:40.494 --> 00:41.891
I'm not doing that.

00:41.976 --> 00:44.497
Okay, relax, mom.
You're working for grandpa.

00:44.498 --> 00:45.495
It's not even a real job.

00:45.495 --> 00:47.191
It's like that summer
when I worked for dad.

00:47.193 --> 00:49.145
He was just trying to make me
feel good about myself.

00:49.147 --> 00:50.330
He didn't really need my help.

00:50.331 --> 00:50.910
That's not true.

00:50.910 --> 00:52.918
I needed your help
distributing all those fliers.

00:52.920 --> 00:55.639
And I did.
Wink, wink.

00:56.212 --> 00:58.055
How are you already
doing homework?

00:58.056 --> 01:00.546
It's junior year.
I have to get good grades.

01:00.547 --> 01:01.900
Don't you know how
competitive it is out there?

01:01.900 --> 01:03.185
Stop pressuring me!

01:03.187 --> 01:04.288
You know, this is
what happens to kids

01:04.290 --> 01:05.775
when they're not sexually active.

01:05.776 --> 01:07.412
Don't you have some studying to do?

01:07.412 --> 01:08.760
Please, it's community college.

01:08.761 --> 01:10.746
They tell you to bring a glue stick.

01:14.865 --> 01:15.721
Hello.

01:16.318 --> 01:19.089
Yes, this is he -- him -- me.

01:19.090 --> 01:20.256
Right the first time.

01:20.257 --> 01:21.305
I'll be right there.

01:21.305 --> 01:22.346
Mitchell, that was it.

01:22.347 --> 01:23.785
That was the call. I'm going in.

01:23.787 --> 01:26.660
Due to budget cuts, my position
as middle-school music teacher

01:26.660 --> 01:27.714
has been eliminated,

01:27.714 --> 01:30.625
so I've been working as
a high-school sub.

01:30.625 --> 01:31.580
Ka-ching!

01:31.582 --> 01:34.358
I never know when I'll be
summoned to swoop into action.

01:34.358 --> 01:35.893
I'm kind of like Batman.

01:35.894 --> 01:38.357
But except for a bat-signal,
I get a phone call.

01:38.358 --> 01:40.297
Yeah, you found
the one difference.

01:40.803 --> 01:41.987
I hate to miss her first day,

01:41.989 --> 01:43.820
but do you mind
taking Lily to school?

01:43.822 --> 01:44.647
Oh, Cam, today?

01:44.648 --> 01:46.225
I got to prep
for my meeting with Charlie.

01:46.226 --> 01:47.181
I only get him for an hour

01:47.182 --> 01:49.423
between his vacations
in Aspen and Cabo.

01:49.425 --> 01:50.738
Okay, you need to confront him.

01:50.740 --> 01:52.690
And tell him his pathetic
little midlife crisis

01:52.691 --> 01:55.400
is making it impossible
for you to do your job.

01:55.402 --> 01:57.487
Because he responds
so well to criticism.

01:57.487 --> 01:59.483
No, he'll fire me,
and then we'll end up

01:59.483 --> 02:01.233
having to get married
in your family's barn.

02:01.234 --> 02:02.552
Oh, well, we need to book that soon.

02:02.553 --> 02:03.809
Because spring is hoedown season,

02:03.809 --> 02:05.329
and then you get right
into summer stock, so...

02:05.330 --> 02:05.940
I don't believe any of that.

02:05.940 --> 02:07.642
All right, if I'm gonna take Lily,
I need to hurry.

02:07.643 --> 02:10.127
Lily, sweetheart,
let's get you dressed.

02:10.127 --> 02:11.744
Hey, I've been dressed for an hour.

02:11.745 --> 02:14.579
Come on, I can't be late.
I'll fall behind.

02:14.579 --> 02:16.782
Sometimes I forget
to factor in the Asian.

02:30.428 --> 02:32.729
Buddy, I know
a new school can be scary,

02:32.730 --> 02:33.822
so a little advice --

02:33.823 --> 02:37.172
every time you meet someone new,
pay them a compliment.

02:37.174 --> 02:37.992
Hey.

02:37.993 --> 02:40.937
Like, um, "I love your hair."

02:40.938 --> 02:44.048
"Awesome kicks."
"You have a beautiful smile."

02:44.048 --> 02:45.977
Okay, dad, I'll tell
that big guy over there

02:45.978 --> 02:47.417
that he's got a beautiful smile.

02:47.418 --> 02:50.058
Fine. Skin, cheekbones,
make it your own.

02:50.060 --> 02:52.689
Um, could you maybe
not walk me all the way in?

02:52.690 --> 02:53.242
What?

02:53.243 --> 02:55.187
- I've got it from here.
- Oh.

02:55.188 --> 02:58.159
Sure. Yeah. Okay.
Give your dad a --

02:58.890 --> 03:00.598
Off you go. Alex!

03:00.599 --> 03:01.431
Hey.

03:03.950 --> 03:05.636
Ay, Manny,
why are you so quiet?

03:05.637 --> 03:08.329
Are you nervous because
of your first day in High School?

03:08.331 --> 03:11.131
Mom, after spending a summer
in Colombia, I'm a changed man.

03:11.132 --> 03:12.699
Oh, my God,
what did you see?!

03:12.701 --> 03:15.246
Nothing, but I am
an international jet-setter now.

03:15.248 --> 03:16.186
I'm sophisticated.

03:16.187 --> 03:18.741
And you think that the girls
are gonna pick up on this?

03:18.743 --> 03:20.981
If not, I still have
my "unaccompanied minor" sign.

03:20.982 --> 03:22.411
Ay, I cannot believe

03:22.412 --> 03:25.045
that my little baby's going
to the High School.

03:25.046 --> 03:28.025
- Mom, stop. You're embarrassing me.
- Ohh.

03:29.763 --> 03:32.580
It's my first day, too.
I could use a hug.

03:32.581 --> 03:33.688
Go!

03:33.689 --> 03:35.753
- Hey, Gloria.
- Hi, Phil.

03:35.754 --> 03:37.348
First day of High School, huh?

03:37.524 --> 03:38.541
Is Manny excited?

03:38.542 --> 03:41.369
Ay, he was up at 5:00
in the morning, ironing.

03:41.370 --> 03:43.988
Oh. Ay, but he does that,
too, when he's depressed,

03:43.989 --> 03:45.435
so now I don't know.

03:45.738 --> 03:46.775
How was Luke?

03:46.775 --> 03:49.287
Great. Yeah, he had
a hard time saying goodbye.

03:49.287 --> 03:52.800
But, um, anyway, I think
I'm gonna go get a cup of coffee.

03:53.078 --> 03:55.377
- Can I go with you?
- Yeah.

03:55.378 --> 03:58.419
Dude, I'm kind of
working something here.

04:02.002 --> 04:03.609
How many trucks would that take?

04:03.734 --> 04:05.062
Uh-huh.
Give me a minute, Fred.

04:05.063 --> 04:06.540
New girl just walked in.

04:07.116 --> 04:08.878
That's disgusting.
She's my daughter.

04:09.293 --> 04:11.236
Sweetheart, you look terrific.

04:11.236 --> 04:11.934
Are you sure?

04:11.935 --> 04:14.182
'Cause I have another
blouse in -- in here.

04:14.183 --> 04:16.237
It's the only thing in here,
that and a pair of glasses.

04:16.237 --> 04:18.327
In case I need to read something
or look smarter.

04:18.327 --> 04:19.353
Relax.

04:19.355 --> 04:20.428
- It's your first day.
- Mm-hmm.

04:20.428 --> 04:23.322
Impossible to blow it.
What are those?

04:23.322 --> 04:24.786
Oh, cookies --
I made them for the office.

04:24.788 --> 04:26.731
Huge mistake.
Fred, two more seconds

04:26.731 --> 04:29.511
I got a situation here.
Put the cookies down.

04:29.513 --> 04:31.232
- Why?
- You're management.

04:31.232 --> 04:32.609
Makes you look desperate.

04:32.609 --> 04:34.300
Makes you look like you
want everyone to like you.

04:34.300 --> 04:35.411
I do want everyone to like me.

04:35.411 --> 04:36.795
You want everyone to respect you.

04:36.795 --> 04:38.509
You got to be tough.
Keep your distance.

04:38.510 --> 04:41.008
Well, maybe we are
different kinds of managers.

04:41.010 --> 04:43.515
Yeah, I'm yours.
Just leave the cookies.

04:45.727 --> 04:47.997
Look at you, my big first-grader.

04:47.997 --> 04:49.545
All right, I want you
to make so many friends

04:49.545 --> 04:50.792
and have so much fun.

04:50.792 --> 04:53.569
Got to go! I can't wait to learn!

04:53.570 --> 04:55.383
- Be careful!
- What?

04:56.918 --> 04:57.883
Nothing.

05:01.564 --> 05:04.738
Please do not be late.
Let's go. Looking good.

05:04.738 --> 05:05.933
Uh, uh, Principal Brown?

05:05.935 --> 05:07.135
Yes. Hi. I'm Cameron Tucker.

05:07.137 --> 05:08.339
I was called in to sub today.

05:08.339 --> 05:10.616
Oh, yeah, you're in
for Mrs. Hurley. Hello.

05:10.616 --> 05:13.373
- Hello. - She has come down
with a sudden case of rehab.

05:13.373 --> 05:14.500
- Oh.
- So do a good job

05:14.501 --> 05:15.835
'cause this could be
a permanent position.

05:15.837 --> 05:17.581
Well, prepare to feel
like an old denim vest.

05:17.581 --> 05:19.773
Because I'm about
to "be-dazzling" you.

05:20.389 --> 05:22.368
I don't know what
that means, but okay.

05:23.575 --> 05:24.700
So, what am I teaching?

05:24.700 --> 05:26.116
A.P. History.

05:27.079 --> 05:27.995
Oh.

05:28.236 --> 05:29.643
I desperately wanted that job.

05:29.645 --> 05:30.729
There was just one problem --

05:30.730 --> 05:32.091
I don't know much about history.

05:32.093 --> 05:33.376
Hmm.
Do you know much biology?

05:33.378 --> 05:33.955
Not now, Mitchell.

05:33.956 --> 05:36.199
What about your science book
or the French you took?

05:36.199 --> 05:37.076
You're lucky I love you.

05:37.077 --> 05:38.810
And I know that
if you love me, too...

05:38.810 --> 05:41.532
â™ª What a wonderful world this would be â™ª

05:41.532 --> 05:43.867
- I really was in a jam, though.
- Yeah.

05:46.730 --> 05:48.877
My dad thinks that he
can motivate his workers

05:48.877 --> 05:51.860
by being a cold,
distant authority figure.

05:51.862 --> 05:55.744
Well, if his style is so effective,
riddle me this --

05:56.101 --> 05:57.729
why didn't I listen to him?

05:59.420 --> 06:00.302
Hey.

06:00.632 --> 06:02.382
Hi. Sorry. I'm Claire.

06:02.384 --> 06:05.224
It's my first day,
so I thought I'd say hi.

06:05.226 --> 06:07.166
- Oh. Hey.- Hi.
- Amazing.

06:07.166 --> 06:10.898
You guys are actually hanging out
by the water cooler.

06:10.900 --> 06:13.701
I have xerostomia.
It's chronic dry mouth.

06:13.701 --> 06:14.847
I'm -- I'm so sorry.

06:14.847 --> 06:18.581
I-I-I-I was just doin' a thang,
you know, like...

06:19.697 --> 06:21.743
Anyway, um...

06:21.860 --> 06:25.183
My door's always open...
to everyone.

06:25.183 --> 06:26.592
That's Pritchett's daughter.

06:27.183 --> 06:29.617
Um, yeah, but I don't want you
to think of me like that.

06:29.617 --> 06:32.934
I'm -- I'm a friend. I'm a colleague.

06:32.934 --> 06:33.896
I'm just like you.

06:33.896 --> 06:36.959
I'm Claire, you know --
worker bee, just...

06:41.951 --> 06:42.585
Great to meet you.

06:42.587 --> 06:44.972
Sorry to interrupt,
and see you around.

06:45.653 --> 06:48.320
I do -- I got to do this one.

06:48.397 --> 06:49.373
Who am I?

06:51.098 --> 06:53.739
You can hang your clothes in me.

06:53.741 --> 06:55.777
Christopher walk-in closet.

07:03.927 --> 07:04.916
What is this?

07:05.214 --> 07:07.645
Oh, sorry, folks. It's closed.
We're shooting a commercial.

07:07.647 --> 07:08.857
So annoying.

07:08.859 --> 07:10.465
Listen, we just want
to get a cup of coffee.

07:10.467 --> 07:12.396
Actually, we're short
a couple of extras.

07:12.396 --> 07:14.857
How would you two like to be in it?

07:14.905 --> 07:16.890
- Yes!
- That sounds amazing.

07:16.945 --> 07:19.157
Hey, um, I see
a couple of old people.

07:19.159 --> 07:21.190
This isn't one of those
catheter commercials, is it?

07:21.192 --> 07:22.358
'Cause if it gets too descriptive,

07:22.359 --> 07:23.607
I'm gonna squirm.

07:23.623 --> 07:25.191
I just did it to myself.

07:26.610 --> 07:28.237
I did my best
to cram for my lecture.

07:28.237 --> 07:30.125
On the revolutionary war,
but, ugh.

07:30.670 --> 07:33.672
All those names and dates --
it's all so dry.

07:34.135 --> 07:35.616
Where's the drama?

07:41.211 --> 07:42.102
Good morrow!

07:42.305 --> 07:42.963
Oh, boy.

07:42.963 --> 07:46.492
Oh, what is all this
strange garb you adorn?

07:46.494 --> 07:49.755
Are you trappers from
the Canadian provinces?

07:49.757 --> 07:52.029
Are you here to sell your beavers?

07:52.212 --> 07:53.381
Who are you?

07:53.383 --> 07:55.792
The 64-pence question.

07:56.581 --> 08:00.608
I crossed the Delaware
during the revolutionary war.

08:00.755 --> 08:05.304
I spent a brutal winter
in valley forge.

08:05.335 --> 08:06.284
Who am I?

08:06.792 --> 08:08.092
I-I have no idea.

08:08.092 --> 08:09.965
I-I swear I don't know
who this man is.

08:09.965 --> 08:13.312
I'm George Washington,
of course.

08:13.312 --> 08:15.434
Our syllabus says we're supposed
to cover native Americans

08:15.435 --> 08:16.925
on the Eve of colonization.

08:16.927 --> 08:20.111
Yes. Native Americans. Indians!

08:20.113 --> 08:22.188
A majestic, peaceful people,

08:22.188 --> 08:25.396
who lived off the land and
cried when they saw litter.

08:25.396 --> 08:27.869
The textbook says many tribes
were often at war,

08:27.870 --> 08:29.178
with allegiances shifting
all of the ti--

08:29.180 --> 08:30.478
Shifting all the time!

08:31.471 --> 08:34.975
So, were the Indians friends
with the colonists or not?

08:34.976 --> 08:36.004
Ah! Yes.

08:36.005 --> 08:37.745
I know one Indian who was friends

08:37.746 --> 08:41.014
with a construction worker,
biker, and traffic cop.

08:41.921 --> 08:42.950
Uh, do y-- nothing?

08:42.951 --> 08:44.010
Seriously, nothing?

08:44.010 --> 08:46.488
Okay, your parents
are gonna love that joke.

08:48.425 --> 08:51.170
Okay, Pritchett, I'm here.
You got a half-hour.

08:51.171 --> 08:53.479
I have my helicopter
standing by on the roof.

08:53.480 --> 08:54.597
Is it even built for that?

08:54.599 --> 08:56.432
No. That's why you only
have a half-hour.

08:56.433 --> 08:57.744
Well, I'm not sure
that's gonna be enough time.

08:57.744 --> 08:58.586
We have a ton to cover.

08:58.586 --> 09:00.728
We need to talk about
new lease agreements

09:00.730 --> 09:02.044
and the workers' comp package.

09:02.044 --> 09:04.734
29 minutes. I think I hear creaking.

09:05.082 --> 09:07.680
- Daddy, I'm bored.
- Whoa.

09:08.203 --> 09:08.790
Me, too.

09:08.790 --> 09:10.891
This is why I shouldn't come
into work between vacations.

09:10.892 --> 09:12.051
Why don't you sit
at Natalie's desk

09:12.052 --> 09:14.036
and pretend to be
my assistant, sweetie?

09:14.044 --> 09:17.092
Sorry about that.
My niece is coming to pick her up.

09:17.093 --> 09:19.348
Lily had an incident
at school today where she --

09:19.349 --> 09:21.532
Hey, Pritchett, you're not
some hot single mom

09:21.532 --> 09:22.374
I'm trying to seduce,

09:22.375 --> 09:23.773
so I don't need
to hear about your kid.

09:23.774 --> 09:25.753
Fair enough.
So, lease agreements.

09:25.754 --> 09:29.017
Okay, I'm getting some push-back
on the Miami location.

09:29.018 --> 09:32.156
Mr. Pritchett, I have
a Haley here to see you.

09:32.247 --> 09:33.054
Oh. Okay.

09:33.055 --> 09:34.953
- Hi.
- Hi, sweetheart.

09:34.954 --> 09:36.718
I'm in the middle
of a meeting with my boss,

09:36.718 --> 09:38.531
but thank you so much
for helping me out.

09:38.532 --> 09:39.280
No problem.

09:39.281 --> 09:40.704
My last class is a pass/fail.

09:40.705 --> 09:43.128
And it's community college,
so it's pass.

09:43.129 --> 09:45.353
Hi. Charlie Bingham.

09:45.354 --> 09:46.912
Wow. Look at your eyes.

09:46.913 --> 09:48.488
Oh. I-I can't.

09:50.266 --> 09:51.398
I like you.

09:51.399 --> 09:52.855
What do you think of these pants?

09:52.856 --> 09:54.182
It's part of our new collection.

09:54.182 --> 09:56.169
It's, uh, a lot of zippers.

09:56.171 --> 09:56.944
It's too many, right?

09:56.946 --> 09:59.399
And they poke into my thigh
when I'm in my helicopter.

09:59.400 --> 10:01.034
'Cause I have a helicopter.
It's not a big deal.

10:01.035 --> 10:02.345
Okay, so, anyway, thank you.

10:02.346 --> 10:04.054
You seem to know
a lot about fashion.

10:04.055 --> 10:05.920
I'd like to get your opinion
on a few things.

10:05.921 --> 10:06.958
- Sure.
- Yeah?

10:06.959 --> 10:09.679
- Yeah. - Actually, no, she --
she needs to stay and watch Lily.

10:09.680 --> 10:10.971
Yeah, you can do that.

10:11.404 --> 10:13.354
Hey, princess. Hey.

10:13.560 --> 10:14.666
I love kids.

10:17.114 --> 10:18.682
Daddy's office.

10:19.866 --> 10:22.234
You sound like a little girl.

10:25.506 --> 10:26.559
Hey, you wanted to see me?

10:26.561 --> 10:28.341
Thanks for "bzzzing" by.

10:28.342 --> 10:30.053
I hope you weren't
in the middle of a "thang."

10:30.054 --> 10:32.087
Okay, that did get
a little away from me.

10:32.087 --> 10:34.458
But to be fair, I broke the ice.

10:34.458 --> 10:35.973
Everybody thinks you're a dummy.

10:35.974 --> 10:37.689
Not everybody.
No, as a matter of fact,

10:37.689 --> 10:39.649
one of the guys in the break room
asked me to lunch.

10:39.650 --> 10:40.870
- Don't say Todd.
- His name is Todd.

10:40.871 --> 10:41.459
Oh, no.

10:41.459 --> 10:43.291
You cannot go to lunch with Todd.

10:43.292 --> 10:43.850
Why not?

10:43.852 --> 10:45.988
You can't be associated with him.

10:45.989 --> 10:48.411
Up until an hour ago,
he was the office weirdo.

10:48.412 --> 10:49.537
But he was nice to me,

10:49.538 --> 10:50.738
and he helped me
set up my computer.

10:50.739 --> 10:53.176
Yeah, that's his job. For now.

10:53.177 --> 10:54.009
What does that mean?

10:54.010 --> 10:56.073
I'm firing him as soon as
I can find an I.T. guy

10:56.075 --> 10:59.157
who shows up on time and
doesn't creep out the office.

10:59.158 --> 11:01.480
I can't cancel on the one person
who was nice to me.

11:01.481 --> 11:03.217
You can, but you won't,
'cause you're the type of person

11:03.217 --> 11:05.147
who brings cookies to the office.

11:05.150 --> 11:05.760
Where are they?

11:05.761 --> 11:07.157
Okay, we're done here.

11:07.685 --> 11:10.929
Okay, folks, you're just having
a normal conversation,

11:10.930 --> 11:12.667
a typical day
in a coffee shop, all right?

11:12.668 --> 11:13.827
Roger that.

11:14.931 --> 11:16.157
Here we go, guys.

11:16.157 --> 11:19.881
And... action!

11:20.037 --> 11:21.267
How have you been, Roy?

11:21.268 --> 11:23.158
Ah, a little down.

11:23.269 --> 11:25.096
Helen and I really miss the kids,

11:25.097 --> 11:27.680
but we just can't afford
to visit them right now.

11:27.682 --> 11:30.429
- Have you considered a reverse mortgage?
- What's that?

11:30.430 --> 11:32.731
- Well, you have equity in your home, right?
- Mmm, this coffee is delicious!

11:32.732 --> 11:35.353
All right, you two in the back,
we can hear you,

11:35.354 --> 11:36.605
so just mime your conversation.

11:36.607 --> 11:37.887
Mime -- mime -- I knew that.

11:37.887 --> 11:39.493
I was already doing that,
so just follow my lead.

11:39.494 --> 11:40.922
Okay, sorry, sorry.
We'll do it again.

11:40.924 --> 11:43.214
But everything else is okay?

11:43.839 --> 11:45.182
You haven't done anything else.

11:45.183 --> 11:47.889
- So, yeah?
- Back to one, guys.

11:48.688 --> 11:49.623
Action.

11:50.063 --> 11:51.370
How have you been, Roy?

11:51.371 --> 11:53.047
Ah, a little down.

11:53.048 --> 11:54.603
Helen and I really miss the kids,

11:54.605 --> 11:56.935
but we just can't afford
to visit them right now.

11:56.937 --> 11:58.886
Have you considered
a reverse mortgage?

11:58.887 --> 11:59.904
What's that?

11:59.905 --> 12:01.789
Well, you have equity
in your home, right?

12:01.790 --> 12:03.006
- Sure, we do.
- What are they doing?

12:03.007 --> 12:04.680
Is she answering
an imaginary phone?

12:04.681 --> 12:05.583
But you still get to live there.

12:05.584 --> 12:07.126
Oh, that sounds
too good to be true.

12:07.127 --> 12:08.412
Don't take my word for it.

12:08.414 --> 12:10.325
Here's Henry Winkler
to tell you more.

12:10.325 --> 12:11.310
Okay, cut.

12:12.825 --> 12:14.047
Couple in the back.

12:14.047 --> 12:16.418
Yep. No, I know.
I know. Bigger?

12:17.302 --> 12:18.936
The native Americans
and the settlers.

12:18.937 --> 12:22.554
Had two completely different
ideas of land ownership.

12:22.556 --> 12:25.987
Eventually, these differences
would lead to war.

12:26.722 --> 12:29.208
Oh. Look, goose bumps.

12:30.964 --> 12:34.112
Okay, yes.
Uh, class dismissed.

12:35.852 --> 12:36.527
We did it!

12:36.527 --> 12:39.473
Thank you so much for stepping in.
Oh, and I promise,

12:39.474 --> 12:41.834
tomorrow, I will do my best
to be more prepared.

12:41.835 --> 12:43.611
Tomorrow? Why won't
Mrs. Hurley be back?

12:43.613 --> 12:45.258
Well, I don't want to be indelicate,

12:45.258 --> 12:48.085
but the good news is, is I might be
your permanent teacher.

12:48.085 --> 12:50.508
- I don't want you to be my
permanent teacher. - Oh, what?

12:50.509 --> 12:51.975
You'd rather have a raging alcoholic?

12:51.976 --> 12:52.740
Listen to me.

12:52.741 --> 12:55.182
I've worked nonstop to build
the perfect academic record,

12:55.183 --> 12:56.973
and I'm not going to let you
screw it up now.

12:56.974 --> 13:01.125
I have an P.P. test in 160 days,
and I need to ace it.

13:01.387 --> 13:03.232
Can you get me there or not?

13:03.862 --> 13:06.780
I can rally like
the brave men of the Alamo.

13:06.781 --> 13:08.783
You do realize that all the men
of the Alamo died?

13:08.785 --> 13:09.580
They all died!

13:13.887 --> 13:16.158
Ruthie's older,
so she thinks she's the boss.

13:16.159 --> 13:18.867
- Mm-hmm.
- But for a little guy, Stu holds his own.

13:19.447 --> 13:20.323
They can be a handful.

13:20.324 --> 13:23.673
But, God, they make me laugh
so hard, you know?

13:23.674 --> 13:26.810
Wow. I did not know you could even
tell the gender of a turtle.

13:26.812 --> 13:27.443
Oh, yeah.

13:27.444 --> 13:30.728
It's called "sexing the turtle,"
and it's an eight-step process.

13:30.728 --> 13:32.708
Now, let's pretend
your hand is a turtle.

13:32.709 --> 13:33.984
- Okay.
- What you do is you flip it over.

13:33.986 --> 13:35.810
- Mm-hmm.
- And then you have to look right into --

13:35.811 --> 13:38.072
Oh, okay. I get it. I get it.
I think I get it.

13:38.074 --> 13:39.995
Oh. I know.
I'm droning on, aren't I?

13:40.454 --> 13:42.426
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah...

13:42.426 --> 13:44.337
- Please, stop. Please stop!
- Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

13:44.339 --> 13:45.238
You're not. You're not.

13:45.239 --> 13:47.357
I am.
But enough about my family.

13:47.359 --> 13:48.315
Tell me about yours.

13:48.316 --> 13:50.521
All right, well,
my husband Phil's a realtor.

13:50.523 --> 13:52.358
That's funny. I'm buying a house.

13:52.360 --> 13:53.741
Why? When?

13:53.742 --> 13:55.727
Actually, we have the final
walk-through today,

13:55.728 --> 13:56.995
sign the papers tomorrow.

13:56.996 --> 13:59.713
Hmm. Th-that's
a really big deal, Todd.

13:59.714 --> 14:01.934
Yeah, and it's a bit
of a stretch for us, too,

14:01.935 --> 14:04.213
but, uh, no, the time is right.

14:04.214 --> 14:05.339
We're just -- we're gonna do it.

14:05.339 --> 14:07.869
"We" is you and the turtles?

14:08.056 --> 14:10.005
No, me and my wife.

14:10.312 --> 14:11.046
A w-- I'm sorry.

14:11.047 --> 14:12.307
You didn't mention your wife.
That's great.

14:12.309 --> 14:15.648
I bet she's got a big, fancy,
high-paying job, right?

14:15.649 --> 14:17.255
Uh, she's getting her master's.

14:17.256 --> 14:18.861
- In?
- Latin.

14:19.639 --> 14:21.251
Oh, Todd.

14:22.725 --> 14:26.425
This may not be the best time
to buy a house.

14:26.426 --> 14:28.510
I hate to be the one
to break this to you --

14:28.511 --> 14:29.837
Oh. No, no, no, no, I got this.

14:30.540 --> 14:31.754
No, you don't.

14:34.059 --> 14:35.310
Stand by, everyone.

14:36.618 --> 14:38.725
I really felt like I nailed
that last one.

14:39.240 --> 14:40.479
I still feel so stiff.

14:40.479 --> 14:42.606
I don't know what
to pretend saying.

14:42.608 --> 14:45.242
You're thinking too much.
Just draw from your own life.

14:45.244 --> 14:46.924
Like, how was your day today?

14:46.926 --> 14:50.191
Lousy. My own son
didn't want to hug me.

14:50.331 --> 14:51.805
Okay, so use that.

14:51.807 --> 14:53.722
My character,
Dr. Stephen Wilson,

14:53.722 --> 14:56.800
is also sad because his son
wouldn't take his advice.

14:57.034 --> 14:59.635
And he wanted to be dropped off
a block away from school.

15:00.161 --> 15:01.680
He expected that
from his daughters.

15:01.680 --> 15:03.504
But thought his son
would be different.

15:04.036 --> 15:05.137
That's so sad.

15:05.138 --> 15:07.297
But Dr. Stephen Wilson
is not going to let that ruin

15:07.298 --> 15:08.864
breakfast with his mistress.

15:11.071 --> 15:14.428
You know, maybe
it's just time for us to --

15:14.782 --> 15:17.213
to accept that
we have to let them go.

15:19.033 --> 15:20.249
Maybe it is.

15:21.448 --> 15:24.420
Okay, everyone, here we go.
We're rolling.

15:25.003 --> 15:27.166
And action!

15:27.266 --> 15:28.620
How have you been, Roy?

15:28.621 --> 15:29.983
A little down.

15:29.984 --> 15:31.533
Helen and I really miss the kids,

15:31.535 --> 15:34.107
but we just can't afford
to visit them right now.

15:34.828 --> 15:37.110
Have you considered
a reverse mortgage?

15:37.111 --> 15:38.264
What's that?

15:38.741 --> 15:41.278
Uh, you have equity
in your home, right?

15:41.278 --> 15:42.247
- Sure, we do.
- Please, no crying.

15:42.248 --> 15:43.904
You're gonna make me cry, too.

15:43.917 --> 15:46.417
Well, essentially
the bank buys your house.

15:46.418 --> 15:48.155
But you still get to live in it.

15:48.639 --> 15:50.156
That sounds too good
to be true.

15:50.158 --> 15:51.607
Don't take my word for it.

15:51.836 --> 15:54.072
Here's Henry Winkler
to tell us more.

15:54.760 --> 15:58.026
I don't want the Fonz
to see me like this.

15:59.484 --> 16:01.341
It's a prototype.
It can withstand

16:01.343 --> 16:03.114
the most extreme
temperatures on the planet.

16:03.115 --> 16:05.844
It's waterproof,
and it wicks sweat.

16:05.845 --> 16:07.190
It also repels women.

16:07.191 --> 16:09.056
I know. I hate it.
I'll burn it tonight!

16:09.057 --> 16:11.022
Aah! Actually, it doesn't burn.

16:11.023 --> 16:13.995
Anyway, if we could get back
to the lease agreements here.

16:13.996 --> 16:15.992
You're amazing.
How would you fix it?

16:15.994 --> 16:17.167
It's too boxy.

16:17.168 --> 16:19.044
Probably have to take it in here...

16:19.045 --> 16:20.198
- Right.
- ...and here.

16:20.198 --> 16:22.252
Yeah, I probably overdo it
in the gym.

16:22.298 --> 16:24.535
Stupid 7% body fat.

16:24.536 --> 16:25.949
Okay, so getting back to work.

16:25.950 --> 16:27.704
We are working.
Why are we working?!

16:27.704 --> 16:31.370
I got to go to Cabo.
Hey, you want to come with me?

16:31.372 --> 16:33.177
Oh, I've, uh, never been to Cabo.

16:33.179 --> 16:35.412
Yeah, she's not going to Cabo
'cause she's half your age.

16:35.412 --> 16:36.819
- How old are you?
- Who cares?

16:36.820 --> 16:38.283
Pretty soon, I'm gonna look 20.

16:38.283 --> 16:40.721
I've been meditating in one
of those pressurized eggs.

16:40.722 --> 16:41.635
Well, if I went to Cabo,

16:41.636 --> 16:43.881
what would the sleeping
situation be?

16:43.971 --> 16:44.603
Not much.

16:44.605 --> 16:46.819
Okay, no, that is enough!
No! No!

16:46.821 --> 16:48.135
She is my niece!

16:48.135 --> 16:49.081
Okay?

16:49.105 --> 16:50.867
This pathetic
midlife crisis of yours

16:50.867 --> 16:52.138
is -- is hurting the company,

16:52.140 --> 16:54.784
and I'm getting so sick
of cleaning up your messes.

16:54.785 --> 16:57.687
Y-you need to focus and
you need to start acting your age --

16:57.689 --> 17:01.248
your -- your real age,
not your egg age.

17:01.841 --> 17:02.691
Huh.

17:03.619 --> 17:07.521
Normally, if someone talked to me
that way, I'd fire him.

17:08.747 --> 17:12.166
But I respect your honesty.
I respect your passion.

17:12.981 --> 17:15.112
It's like me.
I'm a very passionate man.

17:15.113 --> 17:15.682
Just focus.

17:15.684 --> 17:17.719
You're right. You're right.
You're right. You're right.

17:18.373 --> 17:19.704
What's that creaking?

17:22.737 --> 17:24.446
Hut! Hike!

17:24.448 --> 17:26.194
Oh, hey, you're going
the wrong way!

17:26.195 --> 17:27.705
That's the wrong way! No!

17:27.707 --> 17:29.425
Wait. I'm sorry. You're right.

17:30.199 --> 17:32.285
Uh, excuse me, Principal Brown.

17:32.434 --> 17:35.414
Yikes. You know,
most subs just play a movie.

17:35.415 --> 17:37.242
All right, do something different, guys.

17:37.243 --> 17:39.875
Uh, listen, I-I can't be
your history teacher.

17:39.875 --> 17:43.222
Those kids work so hard,
and they deserve someone

17:43.223 --> 17:47.071
who knows the material
and can inspire them, so...

17:47.334 --> 17:48.460
If you say so.

17:48.968 --> 17:49.587
Hey, I was wondering,

17:49.587 --> 17:50.880
what kind of play was that
you were running?

17:50.881 --> 17:52.079
Was that supposed to be a slant?

17:52.079 --> 17:53.473
Our freshman coach quit.

17:53.473 --> 17:55.281
I'm just a glorified babysitter.

17:55.443 --> 17:57.346
Well, your receiver needs
to learn to run his routes,

17:57.347 --> 17:58.830
or the quarterback's never
gonna be able to hit him.

17:58.830 --> 18:00.955
- I-I played in college.
- Oh. Okay.

18:00.955 --> 18:03.087
Hey, Tyler, you need to learn
to run your routes.

18:03.263 --> 18:04.383
What routes?

18:05.241 --> 18:06.964
- Yeah, what routes?
- Um...

18:07.632 --> 18:09.466
Well, you're gonna line up here.

18:09.802 --> 18:10.851
Take three steps.

18:10.851 --> 18:12.671
One, two, three -- plant right,

18:12.672 --> 18:14.640
open left 45 degrees up the field.

18:14.640 --> 18:16.074
Okay, why don't we try it again?

18:16.075 --> 18:17.303
Try it again! Tip!

18:17.304 --> 18:19.027
Put some zip on the ball, 18!

18:19.028 --> 18:20.815
Hut, hut, hike!

18:21.791 --> 18:22.741
Hit him!

18:23.077 --> 18:26.895
Better. Better. Good job.
Circle back up.

18:26.896 --> 18:28.841
All right, anyway,
thank you for the opportunity.

18:28.842 --> 18:30.942
Hey, hey, how would you like
to take over this team?

18:31.270 --> 18:33.364
Well, well,
that's an interesting offer.

18:33.365 --> 18:34.737
- How much does it pay?
- Nothing.

18:34.738 --> 18:35.521
Are you firm on that?

18:35.522 --> 18:37.643
Yeah, but there's a gym-teacher
position available.

18:37.643 --> 18:39.609
- It's all yours if you coach.
- Can I wear shorts?

18:39.610 --> 18:40.872
Yeah, and you get a whistle, too.

18:40.873 --> 18:42.843
Oh, I always get a whistle
when I wear shorts.

18:43.063 --> 18:44.924
I humbly accept your offer.

18:45.036 --> 18:47.531
Huddle up, boys!
Let's go! Hustle!

18:47.532 --> 18:49.733
Do you know what hustle means, 10?!

18:49.780 --> 18:50.984
It really wasn't bad.

18:50.985 --> 18:53.359
Todd is a very interesting guy
when you get to know him.

18:53.360 --> 18:56.014
Did he tell you about his turtles,
little Lulu and Stan?

18:56.015 --> 18:58.352
Ruthie and Stu.
That's the name he picks?

18:58.353 --> 19:00.753
"Turtle stew"? Idiot!

19:00.771 --> 19:02.946
Well, there was one
little situation that came up,

19:02.946 --> 19:04.738
but I think I handled it
pretty well.

19:04.739 --> 19:06.299
- He's about to make, um, kind of a big --
- Hold on.

19:06.300 --> 19:08.531
Margaret, why can't I log in here?

19:09.830 --> 19:11.115
What's wrong with my computer?

19:11.117 --> 19:12.589
The whole system's down.

19:12.590 --> 19:15.686
No one can access files.
We can't get online.

19:15.687 --> 19:16.314
Where's Todd?

19:16.314 --> 19:19.516
We can't find him anywhere,
and his Yaris is gone.

19:19.517 --> 19:21.595
- Where are my files?!
- What the hell?

19:21.613 --> 19:24.667
I-I might know a little
something about this.

19:25.469 --> 19:26.788
What did you do?

19:27.912 --> 19:30.438
Kind of told Todd that
you were gonna fire him.

19:30.439 --> 19:31.588
- What?!
- I had to.

19:31.589 --> 19:33.072
Dad, he's about to buy a house.

19:33.073 --> 19:34.275
But he was fine with it.

19:34.276 --> 19:35.407
He hugged me and thanked me

19:35.409 --> 19:37.980
and told me that it gave him
time to make a plan.

19:39.464 --> 19:40.415
Oh.

19:42.445 --> 19:45.576
Gentlemen, today
is a new beginning.

19:46.529 --> 19:47.985
And that can be scary.

19:49.569 --> 19:52.153
How did it go, Mr. Jet-setter?

19:52.154 --> 19:53.791
Good. Really good.

19:54.628 --> 19:56.195
Do you want to talk about it?

19:56.196 --> 19:57.039
No.

20:00.772 --> 20:03.843
I'm gonna ask things of you that
may not make sense right now.

20:03.844 --> 20:04.641
See you tomorrow, Luke.

20:04.642 --> 20:06.189
Not if I see you first.

20:06.220 --> 20:08.672
There it is!
There's that smile.

20:10.100 --> 20:11.181
But they will.

20:11.182 --> 20:12.900
- Hey, dad.
- Hey, buddy.

20:16.686 --> 20:18.368
- We're at school.
- Yep.

20:19.013 --> 20:20.777
Success is not guaranteed.

20:22.411 --> 20:24.019
It is not handed to you.

20:25.065 --> 20:26.378
Success is earned.

20:29.173 --> 20:30.721
How's that data entry going?

20:30.893 --> 20:33.126
Good. I am up to 1998.

20:33.127 --> 20:36.488
Ah, that's when I'd already
been doing the job 20 years.

20:36.617 --> 20:38.675
So maybe I should listen to you?

20:38.778 --> 20:40.117
Get you home a lot earlier.

20:40.118 --> 20:41.311
Thanks, boss.

20:42.330 --> 20:45.839
Today, we are forging
a new path, people!

20:46.282 --> 20:49.675
The only thing we have
to fear is fear itself!

20:49.675 --> 20:50.532
Wrong president.

20:50.533 --> 20:52.831
- Just keep pushing!
- Okay.
