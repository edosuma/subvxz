We gotta go, your momma
is gonna kill me!

00:20.333 --> 00:21.800
Don't worry, I texted Mom.

00:21.900 --> 00:23.167
That mean you covered for me?

00:23.267 --> 00:24.733
No, I covered for me.

Hey, having a dad's not all
it's cracked up to be.

01:47.300 --> 01:48.700
Look at mine.

01:48.800 --> 01:50.400
Ever since I snuck out
to the Party Break show...

01:50.500 --> 01:51.633
he says I'm not allowed out...

01:51.733 --> 01:53.633
without a "responsible adult
chaperone."

01:53.733 --> 01:55.333
Maybe my mom could chaperone?

01:55.433 --> 01:56.767
I love your mom...

01:56.867 --> 01:59.833
but she's an unwed mother
living in sin...

with her unemployed beefcake
boyfriend.

We don't need someone
to actually go with us...

Nice to meet you.

Really inspiring sermon today.

02:37.100 --> 02:38.533
I know you're probably
pretty upset...

02:38.633 --> 02:40.100
but it's not what it looks like.

02:40.200 --> 02:42.267
Looks like you're pretending
to be a preacher.

02:42.367 --> 02:44.067
That's pretty much it.

02:44.167 --> 02:45.633
But you gotta understand...

I gotta make enough money to pay
your mom that child support.

02:48.067 --> 02:49.367
Oh, so this is my fault?

02:49.467 --> 02:50.733
I didn't say that.

02:50.833 --> 02:52.667
Although, if you look
at it objectively--

Look, save the excuses, Vern.
I don't need a dad.

to go over there...

what I was actually doing.

criminal to catch a criminal.

I'm not gonna do that!

09:56.600 --> 09:58.367
I told you, babe, I'll get
'em to move it...

09:58.467 --> 10:01.700
as soon as I'm done
with my show... jeez.

10:01.800 --> 10:03.133
Whoa! Y'all weren't filming
that, were you?

10:03.233 --> 10:04.433
( PHONE RINGING )

10:04.533 --> 10:06.200
I told you there
was viewers, babe!

10:06.300 --> 10:09.100
Caller, you are "onboard"
with your Captain Ronnie!

10:09.200 --> 10:10.700
CALLER (OVER PHONE):
Yeah, hi, Ronnie.

10:10.800 --> 10:11.967
I'm a big fan of the show,
doing a great job.

10:12.067 --> 10:13.700
Mm-hm.

10:13.800 --> 10:15.200
Listen, you were talking about
the 27' Fountain Fever earlier.

10:15.300 --> 10:16.833
That's right.
I was wondering...

10:16.933 --> 10:18.700
if you've got a 540-injected
engine on that...

10:18.800 --> 10:21.433
how many idiots does it take
to host a cable-access show...

10:21.533 --> 10:23.300
out of his girlfriend's
basement?

10:23.400 --> 10:24.667
Argh! Damn you! Who are you?

10:24.767 --> 10:26.133
I'm coming after you!

10:26.233 --> 10:28.533
Still here, Ronnie.
Argh!

10:28.633 --> 10:30.267
Thank you.

10:30.367 --> 10:31.867
I don't even want to know.

10:31.967 --> 10:35.733
Excuse me... we're interested
in the "lunch special?"

10:36.700 --> 10:38.000
Follow me.

10:38.100 --> 10:41.667
What happens if someone really
wants to hear the lunch special?

10:41.767 --> 10:44.367
Beats me, but check out
this guy.

10:44.467 --> 10:46.300
Classic bad-guy booth.

10:46.400 --> 10:49.800
Excuse me, word on the street
is you have a "product"...

10:49.900 --> 10:51.833
we might be "in the market" for.

10:51.933 --> 10:56.233
I'm afraid I can't help you. I'm
just a small-time businessman.

10:56.333 --> 10:58.833
But what you're into sounds
dangerous.

10:58.933 --> 11:00.867
I'd be careful if I were you.

11:00.967 --> 11:04.333
What if what we're into is
"the lunch special?"

11:04.433 --> 11:06.533
Don't happen to have catfish on
the menu, do you?

11:06.633 --> 11:08.700
No idea. I ordered the lobster.

11:08.800 --> 11:11.500
Did you know that lobsters
are autotomous?

11:11.600 --> 11:17.267
Meaning they can regenerate body
parts, unlike human beings.

11:18.733 --> 11:20.633
Did you know there's a species
of crustaceans...

11:20.733 --> 11:22.200
called gribbles,
that lives on wood...

11:22.300 --> 11:24.567
and has actually sunk
pirate ships?

11:24.667 --> 11:26.167
Psst... hey!

11:26.267 --> 11:29.167
I told you to follow me.
We're going out back.

11:29.267 --> 11:31.200
Why does this always happen?

11:31.300 --> 11:34.167
And please receive Kevin into
thy loving arms...

11:34.267 --> 11:39.067
as he's sacrificed his life that
we might enjoy his savory hocks.

11:39.100 --> 11:40.767
Amen.

11:40.867 --> 11:42.600
Amen.
Amen.

11:42.700 --> 11:44.600
Just follow my lead,
so we can get out of here.

11:44.700 --> 11:47.833
So, Pastor Johnson, what led you
to do the Lord's work?

11:47.933 --> 11:49.367
Hm.

11:52.567 --> 11:56.367
These biscuits are delicious.

11:56.467 --> 11:58.833
We were delighted to hear that
Charlotte had a father...

11:58.933 --> 12:00.333
who's also a pastor.
Mm-hm.

12:00.433 --> 12:02.067
And why haven't we heard
about you?

12:02.167 --> 12:03.900
Uh, the reason you've never
heard about my father...

12:04.067 --> 12:05.133
before is because...

12:05.233 --> 12:07.167
We just met.
he's been traveling.

12:07.267 --> 12:08.233
And... we just met.

12:08.333 --> 12:10.100
I was traveling... on the road.

12:10.200 --> 12:11.267
Uh, doing missionary work.

12:11.367 --> 12:12.300
Mm-hm, yeah.

12:12.400 --> 12:16.900
Healing, preaching... uh--

12:17.067 --> 12:19.067
Food.
Feeding... feeding.

12:19.133 --> 12:20.700
Yeah, feeding the needy.

12:20.800 --> 12:23.433
Yeah, and boy, I'll tell you,
there was some needy ones.

12:23.533 --> 12:24.967
Sometimes they'd come back
for seconds...

12:25.067 --> 12:27.300
and I'd be like, whoa,
that is one needy m--

12:27.400 --> 12:29.300
Anyway, he didn't even know
he had a daughter...

12:29.400 --> 12:30.833
until a couple weeks ago.

12:30.933 --> 12:34.533
Yeah, when I met her mom,
I was on a different path.

12:34.633 --> 12:39.533
A lot of booze, drugs, liquor,
women... more booze.

12:40.933 --> 12:43.333
I mean, it was a time period
in my life...

12:43.433 --> 12:44.800
where I made a lot of mistakes.

12:44.900 --> 12:49.733
Well, God forgives, Pastor.
We all make mistakes.

12:57.733 --> 12:58.800
Hm.

12:58.900 --> 13:01.633
Anyway, I guess without
those wrong turns...

13:01.733 --> 13:03.367
I wouldn't have this
little lady here...

13:03.467 --> 13:07.733
and that'd be the biggest
mistake of all.

13:07.833 --> 13:11.067
Sweetheart, you haven't even
tried your Kevin.

13:11.100 --> 13:12.633
He was my friend, Dad...

13:12.733 --> 13:14.700
not just some slaughter pig.

13:14.800 --> 13:17.467
All pigs are slaughter pigs,
honey.

13:20.233 --> 13:21.933
You want the rest of my Kevin?

13:22.067 --> 13:23.900
I'm okay.

13:28.500 --> 13:30.833
you might not like what
you smell.

13:32.433 --> 13:34.367
What's going on? Who is that?

13:34.467 --> 13:36.467
A dishwasher and a busboy.

13:36.567 --> 13:38.067
The busboy is holding a dead
catfish.

13:38.100 --> 13:40.933
You two don't seem like
the fireworks type.

13:41.067 --> 13:42.433
What makes you say that?

13:42.533 --> 13:44.233
Well, he's blind... for one.
You listen here--

13:44.333 --> 13:46.333
I see what I need to see!

13:46.433 --> 13:48.667
Someone you sold fireworks to...

13:48.767 --> 13:50.667
made a mess of my church
mailbox.

13:50.767 --> 13:53.233
And no one messes
with my church mailbox.

13:53.333 --> 13:56.067
So, you can make it right and
never see us again...

13:56.133 --> 13:58.733
or I'm gonna run your ass
clean out of town.

13:58.833 --> 13:59.867
Got it?

14:03.233 --> 14:04.200
Got it?

14:04.300 --> 14:05.500
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we got it.

14:05.600 --> 14:07.667
See ya round, fellas.

14:07.767 --> 14:10.200
Yeah, see you around, fellas.

14:10.300 --> 14:11.633
What happened?

14:11.733 --> 14:13.700
You were supposed to slap him
with the catfish.

14:13.800 --> 14:15.567
That was the entire reason
we brought it.

14:15.667 --> 14:18.500
He really has been phoning
it in lately.

14:18.600 --> 14:21.433
Agh, that took forever.

14:21.533 --> 14:23.933
I hope the band is still on.

14:25.833 --> 14:29.100
All right, I want to make it
clear, lying is wrong.

14:29.200 --> 14:30.600
You should never lie.

14:30.700 --> 14:32.933
Unless it's to save someone
else's feelings.

14:33.067 --> 14:34.933
Or it helps you get
what you want.

14:35.067 --> 14:38.133
Or it just makes things easier
for you in one way or another.

14:38.233 --> 14:39.633
Otherwise, it's wrong.

14:39.733 --> 14:42.267
Okay, great life lesson! You can
pick us up in a few hours.

14:42.367 --> 14:44.700
Thanks for the ride,
Mr-- Vernon.

14:44.800 --> 14:47.200
Uh, what are you doing?

14:47.300 --> 14:48.633
I'm coming in to hear the band.

14:48.733 --> 14:50.300
You, uh, really don't
have to do that.

14:50.400 --> 14:52.233
Aw, have to? I want to!

14:52.333 --> 14:54.900
Plus, I can help you pass out
your little magazine things.

14:55.067 --> 14:59.867
They're called zines, and I just
leave them for people to grab.

15:00.067 --> 15:02.200
Holy crap, man, I can't
believe you wrote this.

15:02.300 --> 15:03.500
That's a helluva lotta words!

15:03.600 --> 15:06.067
Uh, yeah, well, uh...
we gotta pee!

15:06.167 --> 15:07.933
Hey, but nobody's ever gonna
read these...

15:08.067 --> 15:09.967
if you just leave 'em
laying here!

15:10.067 --> 15:11.833
Here, man, check this out.
You'll love it.

15:11.933 --> 15:14.167
Read this... it's very cool.

15:14.267 --> 15:18.900
( HUMMING )

15:19.067 --> 15:22.267
Did you get them to move
that boat?

15:22.367 --> 15:26.933
Ronnie, if I look out the
window, am I gonna see a boat?

15:27.067 --> 15:29.633
Hm? Hm.

15:31.533 --> 15:33.067
Damn it! He's outside now!

15:33.100 --> 15:36.067
[DEBBIE] Will you get over there
and tell him to move the boat?

15:38.633 --> 15:40.233
Stan, I want to talk about--

15:40.333 --> 15:42.533
That's right, you tell him!

15:42.633 --> 15:44.500
I saw a squirrel over there!
He ran over here!

15:44.600 --> 15:46.200
Under your beautiful boat,
which I love...

15:46.300 --> 15:47.533
which you keep nice and clean...

15:47.633 --> 15:48.833
then he ran to the top
of the tree...

15:48.933 --> 15:50.400
and then all these nuts
started coming down.

15:50.500 --> 15:52.433
He's crushing nuts to the left,
crushing nuts to the right.

15:52.533 --> 15:55.067
Crushing all the nuts!

15:56.967 --> 15:59.633
That's really something.
Would you like a beer?

15:59.733 --> 16:01.100
I would love to have a beer,
Stan!

16:01.200 --> 16:03.333
But I can't have one,
now can I?

16:07.567 --> 16:09.133
[RONNIE] Hey!

16:12.567 --> 16:13.800
Watch out.

16:13.900 --> 16:15.567
Hey!
Hey, what's up, what's up!

16:15.667 --> 16:17.533
Hey, like, what's up,
what's up, what's up?

16:17.633 --> 16:18.533
Dude, why are you so sweaty,
man?

16:18.633 --> 16:20.133
What? Oh, because--

16:20.233 --> 16:21.767
Well, you guys left before
I was done getting ready...

16:21.867 --> 16:23.267
so I just ran down.

16:23.367 --> 16:25.933
Go stand over there... until
you're not so gross.

16:26.067 --> 16:27.800
Okay, I'll just-- I'll be
over here.

16:27.900 --> 16:30.100
You gotta take one of these
zines, they're incredible.

16:30.200 --> 16:33.333
Hey! You've got my face
on your chest!

16:33.433 --> 16:35.100
Excuse me?

16:35.200 --> 16:36.733
That picture, that's me!

16:36.833 --> 16:40.067
Oh, yeah, I got this
at a thrift store, it's retro.

16:40.100 --> 16:41.367
If you want me to sign it,
I will.

16:41.467 --> 16:43.467
Oh, God... no, no--

16:43.567 --> 16:46.067
Guys, check it out!
It's Burnin' Vernon!

16:46.133 --> 16:48.900
We used to get so baked to your
song back in middle school.

16:49.067 --> 16:51.067
Take a picture, will you?

16:51.100 --> 16:54.067
I'm totally winning Instagram
with this.

16:57.733 --> 17:00.433
Great shot.

17:00.533 --> 17:02.500
Comes with the territory.

17:02.600 --> 17:04.367
Do you know this guy?

17:04.467 --> 17:05.800
Uh--

17:05.900 --> 17:07.900
Uh, no, I was just so excited
about these zines.

17:08.067 --> 17:09.500
Thought everybody should
read one.

17:09.600 --> 17:13.367
Anyway, I gotta get going,
young lady who I don't know.

17:21.467 --> 17:23.900
Here you go, last one left,
your lucky day.

17:24.067 --> 17:26.733
Hey, wait up, I know you!
You're Burnin' Vernon.

17:26.833 --> 17:28.400
Yep, that's me... the "guy
from the nineties"...

17:28.500 --> 17:30.067
sang "that one song."

17:30.167 --> 17:32.533
Hey, "that one song" may have
been the only one to chart...

17:32.633 --> 17:34.367
but your whole album
was pretty solid.

17:34.467 --> 17:36.700
Wait a minute, you heard my
whole album?

17:36.800 --> 17:39.667
I've heard all your stuff.
I'm a fan.

17:39.767 --> 17:41.467
I'm also a bit of the music
geek.

17:41.567 --> 17:42.833
I work for Nashville Scene.

17:42.933 --> 17:45.867
No offense, but I thought
you were dead.

17:45.967 --> 17:49.100
Seems to be a common
misconception.

17:49.200 --> 17:49.967
What's this?

17:50.067 --> 17:51.367
Oh, my daughter wrote it.

17:51.467 --> 17:53.600
Local bands she's listening to,
stuff like that.

17:53.700 --> 17:55.067
It's good, too.

17:55.167 --> 17:57.633
So I guess a love of music
runs in the family, huh?

17:57.733 --> 17:59.200
I guess it does.

17:59.300 --> 18:01.967
Well, if she is anywhere near
as talented as you are...

18:02.067 --> 18:04.467
I'm gonna check it out.

18:04.567 --> 18:07.867
Lotta things being checked out
right now, honey.

18:13.933 --> 18:15.233
So, this is my studio...

18:15.333 --> 18:17.333
and I thought we could do
the photo in here.

18:17.433 --> 18:19.500
Sorry, babe, if you want,
I'll march over there...

18:19.600 --> 18:22.967
steal the keys and move it
myself... in two minutes.

18:23.067 --> 18:25.500
Oh, don't worry, I told
him to move the boat.

18:25.600 --> 18:27.967
They acted like they didn't even
know what I was talking about.

18:28.067 --> 18:30.067
( ENGINE STARTING )
( HORN HONKING )

18:30.167 --> 18:32.900
Where are you--
My boat!

18:33.067 --> 18:38.200
What did you do to me, woman?
My boat! No!

18:38.300 --> 18:40.100
My boat!

18:41.633 --> 18:44.800
Well, look at this. I guess
Catfish is a man of his word.

18:44.900 --> 18:47.067
What is it?
You know I can't see.

18:47.167 --> 18:49.100
Mailbox has been replaced.

18:49.200 --> 18:53.067
There's a box inside
with a note.

18:53.167 --> 18:57.400
Sorry for the inconvenience,
enjoy a big bang on me.

18:59.467 --> 19:01.200
Huh?

19:01.300 --> 19:04.567
Are you Charlotte?
Did you write this?

19:04.667 --> 19:07.667
Yes, I am.
I mean, I did. Both.

19:07.767 --> 19:10.933
You know, it's funny, I never
pick these things up...

19:11.067 --> 19:13.333
but this one was handed to me.

19:13.433 --> 19:16.733
Oh, God, I'm sorry. I told him
nobody ever does that.

19:16.833 --> 19:19.133
Don't worry, my dad embarrasses
me, too.

19:19.233 --> 19:21.167
At least yours is kind
of charming.

19:21.267 --> 19:23.167
I'm Allison, I work
at Nashville Scene.

19:23.267 --> 19:24.133
Oh.

19:24.233 --> 19:26.600
I gotta say...
this is really good.

19:26.700 --> 19:28.067
Wow, thanks.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.367
Who are you listening
to right now?

19:29.467 --> 19:31.667
Natural Child are great,
so is Faux Ferocious.

19:31.767 --> 19:34.167
And right now, Party Break
are my current favorite.

19:34.267 --> 19:35.867
Well, I'll look forward to
reading about them...

19:35.967 --> 19:37.333
in your next zine.

19:37.433 --> 19:40.400
You should send me a copy,
if you get a chance.

19:40.500 --> 19:41.467
Thanks.

19:41.567 --> 19:43.133
Hey, I heard you talking
about Party Break.

19:43.233 --> 19:45.700
I'm the keyboardist
from Party Break, I'm Val!

19:45.800 --> 19:47.367
I got a solo show coming up!

19:47.467 --> 19:50.433
If you're with the Nashville
Scene, you should... just go.

19:53.733 --> 19:55.500
Hey, my eyes are up here.

19:55.600 --> 19:56.867
My eyes are down there.

19:56.967 --> 19:59.567
Damn, I was a good-looking
sonuvabitch.

20:01.333 --> 20:04.333
One summer when I was a kid, I
got holda some bottle rockets.

20:04.433 --> 20:07.267
I'd fire them suckers
off all night.

20:07.367 --> 20:09.733
Meemaw said, "Boy, them bottle
rockets are dangerous!"

20:09.833 --> 20:13.733
But pride got the better of me
and I just wouldn't listen.

20:13.833 --> 20:15.800
And that's how you lost
your eyesight.

20:15.900 --> 20:17.500
What? No, uh-uh.

20:17.600 --> 20:20.567
Burned my thumb bad, though.

20:20.667 --> 20:25.167
You know, Curtis, I think we
made a pretty good team today.

20:26.700 --> 20:32.067
It's too bad all this evidence
is gone up in smoke.

20:32.167 --> 20:33.967
That's a pretty good one.

20:34.067 --> 20:36.767
Now go on and clean this mess
up, convict.

20:36.867 --> 20:38.400
Right.

20:49.267 --> 20:50.700
Aw.

20:52.067 --> 20:53.300
Oh, man!

20:53.400 --> 20:56.433
Ronnie, you're in every one?

20:56.533 --> 20:58.600
Oh, come on, you gotta
be kidding me!

20:58.700 --> 21:01.433
( REVERSE BEEPING )
( SHRUBBERY CRUNCHING )

21:05.167 --> 21:06.500
All right.
