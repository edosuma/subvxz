WEBVTT

00:05.533 --> 00:07.401
Awkward silence.

00:07.403 --> 00:08.685
Sheldon on his phone.

00:08.687 --> 00:09.720
No touching.

00:09.722 --> 00:13.123
Somebody's having date night.

00:13.125 --> 00:15.209
It's actually steamier
than it looks.

00:15.211 --> 00:18.078
Sheldon's looking up the phallic
symbolism of root vegetables

00:18.080 --> 00:19.797
in Renaissance paintings.

00:19.799 --> 00:21.448
Oh, no, I got bored
with that.

00:21.450 --> 00:25.419
I'm just browsing
cuticle scissors on Amazon.

00:26.371 --> 00:28.005
How do you
not tear off his clothes

00:28.007 --> 00:30.557
and take him right here
on this table?

00:30.559 --> 00:33.260
If you do that, I'll scream.

00:36.431 --> 00:38.632
Sheldon, I have some
exciting news to tell you.

00:38.634 --> 00:39.783
That makes two of us.

00:39.785 --> 00:41.268
My new cuticle scissors
will be here

00:41.270 --> 00:43.153
in one to two business days.

00:43.155 --> 00:45.722
Come on, one.

00:45.724 --> 00:47.825
I've been invited to
consult on an experiment

00:47.827 --> 00:50.194
at your university
for a few months.

00:50.196 --> 00:51.328
Isn't that great?

00:51.330 --> 00:52.913
We could have lunch together.

00:52.915 --> 00:54.315
We could carpool.

00:54.317 --> 00:56.467
You know, riding with Leonard

00:56.469 --> 00:58.736
has gotten
a little tedious lately.

00:58.738 --> 01:02.206
Th-The only car game he ever
wants to play is the Quiet Game.

01:02.208 --> 01:03.307
And he's terrible at it.

01:03.309 --> 01:05.459
I always win.

01:06.845 --> 01:08.729
So, you're okay with this?

01:08.731 --> 01:10.397
Well, why wouldn't I be?

01:10.399 --> 01:12.433
Well, this project
would have us working

01:12.435 --> 01:14.468
in close proximity
to one another.

01:14.470 --> 01:15.969
And there's the vulgar adage

01:15.971 --> 01:19.640
that one should not
defecate where one eats.

01:19.642 --> 01:21.975
My father used to say
that all the time.

01:21.977 --> 01:25.162
That and, um, "Who does one
have to orally gratify

01:25.164 --> 01:27.881
to get a drink around here?"

01:29.234 --> 01:31.719
But what does that have to do

01:31.721 --> 01:33.637
with you working
at the university?

01:33.639 --> 01:36.240
Sheldon, "Don't defecate
where you eat,"

01:36.242 --> 01:38.275
means don't have a
romantic relationship

01:38.277 --> 01:39.877
in the workplace.

01:41.079 --> 01:43.063
Really?

01:45.767 --> 01:47.384
Yes.

01:47.386 --> 01:48.469
Huh.

01:48.471 --> 01:50.788
Yeah, I always
took it literally.

01:50.790 --> 01:53.623
That's why I have never
once moved my bowels

01:53.625 --> 01:55.993
in this or any restaurant.

01:55.995 --> 01:57.945
Hmm.

01:57.947 --> 01:59.980
I'm relieved that you
don't have a problem

01:59.982 --> 02:01.265
with us working together.

02:01.267 --> 02:03.517
Not as relieved
as I'm about to be.

02:04.519 --> 02:06.754
It's a brave new world,
little lady.

02:37.819 --> 02:39.386
Are you crazy?

02:39.388 --> 02:40.437
You don't want

02:40.439 --> 02:42.306
your girlfriend
at work with you.

02:42.308 --> 02:45.008
Hell Clam.

02:45.010 --> 02:46.527
Why not?

02:46.529 --> 02:49.113
Hairy Fairy.

02:49.115 --> 02:50.681
I think it could be romantic.

02:50.683 --> 02:52.650
You know, my parents met
at his place of work.

02:52.652 --> 02:55.686
Your father's a gynecologist.

02:55.688 --> 02:56.870
I know.

02:56.872 --> 02:59.823
What started as a pap smear
turned into a date.

03:01.293 --> 03:02.676
Which turned
into her working there,

03:02.678 --> 03:04.645
which turned into marriage,
which then turned into hatred,

03:04.647 --> 03:07.197
which continues to this day.

03:07.299 --> 03:10.067
Two-Eyed Cyclops.

03:10.069 --> 03:12.903
Would you please tell him
this isn't a good idea?

03:12.905 --> 03:14.271
No, no, I think it'll be great.

03:14.273 --> 03:15.889
Maybe next time he gets
conjunctivitis at work,

03:15.891 --> 03:19.943
she can hold his head and try
to put the drops in his eyes.

03:19.945 --> 03:22.429
Giant baby.

03:22.431 --> 03:24.281
That's a Raging Ogre.

03:24.283 --> 03:26.517
Yeah, I know.

03:28.520 --> 03:30.687
I'm just saying, I'd never want
to work with Bernadette.

03:30.689 --> 03:32.656
Can you imagine seeing
someone all day long

03:32.658 --> 03:34.124
and then you're
supposed to hang out

03:34.126 --> 03:35.826
with them after work, too?

03:35.828 --> 03:37.494
Hold on. We do
that all the time.

03:37.496 --> 03:39.229
You and I work together
and play together.

03:39.231 --> 03:42.883
Yeah, I know, and it drove me
into the arms of another woman.

03:44.702 --> 03:46.720
Bipolar Bear.

03:46.722 --> 03:49.606
Well, I appreciate your concern,

03:49.608 --> 03:52.810
but I won't be seeing any more
of Amy than I already do.

03:52.812 --> 03:55.095
I assume we'll deduct
any extra time we spend together

03:55.097 --> 03:57.965
at work from our weekly quota.

03:59.884 --> 04:02.553
Please let me be there
when you tell her that.

04:03.521 --> 04:05.689
Why? So you can see the
look on Amy's face

04:05.691 --> 04:07.991
when she hears
my top-notch idea?

04:07.993 --> 04:10.577
Please, oh, please,
just let me be there.

04:12.547 --> 04:15.682
So, Amy, what are you gonna
be working on at Caltech?

04:15.684 --> 04:17.468
I'm leading a study to see

04:17.470 --> 04:19.369
if deficiency of the
monoamine oxidase enzyme

04:19.370 --> 04:21.445
leads to paralyzing
fear in monkeys.

04:21.470 --> 04:22.340
Oh.

04:22.341 --> 04:25.159
If they're anything like humans,
the answer's yes.

04:25.161 --> 04:27.578
Wait, you've-you've done
this experiment on humans?

04:27.580 --> 04:30.264
You mean like death row inmates
with nothing to lose?

04:30.366 --> 04:33.083
No, that would be unethical.

04:34.619 --> 04:36.587
You know,
not a lot of people know this,

04:36.589 --> 04:37.838
but the monoamine oxidase enzyme

04:37.840 --> 04:39.790
was discovered by a woman,
Mary Bernheim.

04:42.277 --> 04:43.543
That's right.

04:43.545 --> 04:46.546
My phone is just
as smart as you guys.

04:48.317 --> 04:49.449
Amy, Bernadette, Penny.

04:49.451 --> 04:51.151
Amy, Bernadette,
Penny.

04:51.153 --> 04:53.537
Amy, Bernadette, Penny.

04:53.539 --> 04:56.306
He's never gonna
stop doing that, is he?

04:56.308 --> 04:57.441
I don't mind.

04:57.443 --> 04:59.109
I'm hoping to put
his love of repetition

04:59.111 --> 05:00.861
to good use someday.

05:03.247 --> 05:05.232
Hi. Um...

05:05.234 --> 05:06.400
I've reconsidered.

05:06.402 --> 05:07.901
Uh, you can't work
where I work.

05:07.903 --> 05:09.269
Enjoy the rest
of your evening.

05:09.271 --> 05:10.904
Sheldon.

05:10.906 --> 05:13.123
I-I already signed
the contract.

05:13.125 --> 05:14.524
I cashed a check.

05:14.526 --> 05:16.576
Mmm... you are not going

05:16.578 --> 05:18.428
to come out of
this looking good.

05:18.430 --> 05:19.663
Sheldon,
I don't understand.

05:19.665 --> 05:21.581
I thought you said
you were fine with it.

05:21.583 --> 05:22.699
Well, I was.

05:22.701 --> 05:24.334
But that was before
Howard explained to me

05:24.336 --> 05:26.470
how awful it would be
if he had to work

05:26.472 --> 05:28.138
with his significant other.

05:28.140 --> 05:30.724
He said what?

05:30.726 --> 05:32.676
Now, don't be insulted.

05:32.678 --> 05:36.897
He just thinks too much of you
would be mind-numbingly tedious.

05:36.899 --> 05:40.067
Excuse me, I need to have
a chat with my husband.

05:40.069 --> 05:41.902
Yeah, well, now,
well... keep it short.

05:41.904 --> 05:45.439
Fr-From what I gather,
brevity is your friend.

05:46.574 --> 05:48.742
So, are we good here?

05:48.744 --> 05:50.327
No, we're not good here.

05:50.329 --> 05:51.828
I am working on this project.

05:51.830 --> 05:54.081
Yeah, and you can't tell her
what she can and cannot do.

05:54.083 --> 05:56.099
Last week, you told Leonard
he couldn't wear

05:56.101 --> 05:58.301
his Wookiee jacket
out in public.

05:58.303 --> 05:59.519
That's different.

05:59.521 --> 06:01.455
I'm not going to the mall
with someone dressed

06:01.457 --> 06:03.540
dumb space bear.

06:05.576 --> 06:07.627
Sheldon, you don't have to worry
about me bothering you.

06:07.629 --> 06:08.879
I'll be in a different building.

06:08.881 --> 06:10.747
And we don't even have
to have lunch together.

06:10.749 --> 06:11.865
Really?

06:11.867 --> 06:14.518
Yes. Before all things,
I'm a scientist.

06:14.520 --> 06:16.970
I'm just there to do my work
and, with a little luck,

06:16.972 --> 06:19.606
scare the living crap
out of some monkeys.

06:19.608 --> 06:23.143
Hmm.

06:23.145 --> 06:25.812
You sure your mothlike
personality won't be drawn

06:25.814 --> 06:28.565
to this blazing fire
that is myself?

06:31.536 --> 06:33.787
More and more sure.

06:33.789 --> 06:36.873
Well, then, you
have my permission.

06:36.875 --> 06:37.958
I didn't ask
for your permission.

06:37.960 --> 06:39.159
Too late. No backsies.

06:41.612 --> 06:44.414
No, no, listen to me.
Sheldon misunderstood.

06:44.416 --> 06:45.382
What I meant was,

06:45.384 --> 06:46.449
if we worked together,

06:46.451 --> 06:48.118
there'd be too much
of me for you,

06:48.120 --> 06:50.253
not the other way around.

06:50.255 --> 06:52.723
Howard, if you're going
to lie to your wife,

06:52.725 --> 06:55.325
don't start the sentence
with "Sheldon misunderstood."

06:56.878 --> 06:58.011
That's a dead giveaway.

06:58.013 --> 06:59.930
Well?

06:59.932 --> 07:01.131
Okay, fine.

07:01.133 --> 07:02.899
I did say that,
and I think it's true.

07:02.901 --> 07:05.018
I think if we worked together
and lived together,

07:05.020 --> 07:06.520
we'd get sick of each other.

07:06.522 --> 07:08.105
Yeah, but to be fair,
he only said the part

07:08.107 --> 07:09.189
about him
getting sick of you.

07:09.191 --> 07:11.024
For the love of God, why?!

07:15.213 --> 07:17.864
What exactly do you
think you'd get sick of?

07:17.866 --> 07:20.016
His only options here
are to fake a heart attack

07:20.018 --> 07:22.385
or have a real one.

07:22.387 --> 07:25.655
It-it's nothing
in particular. I...

07:25.657 --> 07:27.824
Is it my voice?
Am I too bossy?

07:27.826 --> 07:28.959
What...?

07:28.961 --> 07:31.878
My arm is feeling numb.

07:32.797 --> 07:35.782
Nailed it.

07:35.784 --> 07:39.386
That's the wrong arm for
a heart attack, doofus.

07:41.222 --> 07:44.357
My point is, I'm sure
there are things about me

07:44.359 --> 07:46.643
that would drive you crazy
if you had to deal

07:46.645 --> 07:48.395
with them all day long.

07:48.397 --> 07:50.597
Like looking me in the
eye and lying to me?

07:50.599 --> 07:52.149
Oh, well, come on, I just...

07:52.151 --> 07:55.402
Where am I supposed to
look when I lie to you?

07:55.404 --> 07:57.754
Find somewhere else
to sleep tonight.

07:57.756 --> 07:59.906
Oh, Bernie...

08:06.864 --> 08:10.467
If it makes you feel any better,
Amy and I are fine.

08:13.070 --> 08:15.238
I mean, really good.

08:17.475 --> 08:19.843
So, boys, how was
the pajama party?

08:19.845 --> 08:23.730
You guys jump on the bed
and sing into hair brushes?

08:23.732 --> 08:25.932
It wasn't a pajama party.

08:25.934 --> 08:28.435
It was just a couple of bros
hanging out, giggling,

08:28.437 --> 08:31.521
eating cookie dough
and watching <i>Princess Bride.</i>

08:33.073 --> 08:34.607
Please, stop talking.

08:36.244 --> 08:38.861
As you wish.

08:42.667 --> 08:44.734
I mean, you know, Sheldon,
none of this would've happened

08:44.736 --> 08:46.203
if I hadn't tried
to help you.

08:46.205 --> 08:48.788
Uh, it also wouldn't
have happened

08:48.790 --> 08:50.290
if, in the early universe,

08:50.292 --> 08:53.793
hydrogen was a little more
common or a little less common.

08:53.795 --> 08:56.279
This is fun. Your turn.

08:57.265 --> 08:58.598
Gentlemen.
Hey, Amy.

08:58.600 --> 09:00.283
Hello.

09:00.285 --> 09:01.685
That was kind of icy.

09:01.687 --> 09:03.336
You two okay?

09:03.338 --> 09:04.354
Oh, we're fine.

09:04.356 --> 09:05.772
As Howard advised,

09:05.774 --> 09:07.974
she's merely respecting our
professional boundaries.

09:07.976 --> 09:08.942
Smart.

09:08.944 --> 09:10.544
Take relationship advice
from a man

09:10.546 --> 09:12.963
who spent last night
braiding Raj's hair.

09:15.432 --> 09:18.451
Yeah, you make
a good point.

09:18.453 --> 09:20.654
It would appear
I was worried for nothing.

09:20.656 --> 09:22.205
Look at her, desperately wishing

09:22.207 --> 09:24.157
she was over here
at the cool table.

09:26.577 --> 09:28.328
Don't worry, little moth.

09:28.330 --> 09:30.630
The flame will come to you.

09:32.833 --> 09:34.568
Oh, uh...

09:34.570 --> 09:36.386
on the off chance that
Bernadette doesn't call back

09:36.388 --> 09:37.771
and apologize,
how do you feel

09:37.773 --> 09:39.673
about Mexican food
for dinner tonight?

09:39.675 --> 09:41.841
I-I don't know.
Sounds kind of heavy.

09:41.843 --> 09:44.811
That's 'cause you always
fill up on chips.

09:44.813 --> 09:47.480
And this is Dr. Gunderson
from Stockholm.

09:47.482 --> 09:49.032
Ah, Sweden.

09:49.034 --> 09:50.734
Yeah, home of my favorite Muppet

09:50.736 --> 09:53.720
and, uh,
second favorite meatball.

09:57.141 --> 10:01.344
Okay, the Nordic reputation for
lack of humor is well-founded.

10:02.813 --> 10:05.582
Boy, is his name Gunderson
or No-Funderson?

10:06.834 --> 10:09.069
Where are we going
with this, Dr. Cooper?

10:09.071 --> 10:11.104
Oh, please, I'm your boyfriend.

10:11.106 --> 10:13.556
You call me Sheldon.

10:13.558 --> 10:16.159
That's right,
I am in a boy-girl relationship

10:16.161 --> 10:18.929
with this cute little
lump of wool.

10:18.931 --> 10:20.046
Sheldon...

10:20.048 --> 10:21.765
It's a physical
relationship, too.

10:21.767 --> 10:25.518
Hand-holding, hugging...
even on hot days.

10:25.520 --> 10:27.387
Ow.

10:28.172 --> 10:29.539
Okay, here's a new one.

10:29.541 --> 10:31.141
Apparently now
we kick each other

10:31.143 --> 10:32.776
in the shin under the table.

10:34.478 --> 10:37.013
How do you like it
when I do it to you?

10:38.399 --> 10:41.067
Not so much, huh?

10:43.000 --> 10:49.074

10:53.499 --> 10:55.884
Test subject D7,

10:55.886 --> 10:58.536
aka Betsy, fear response study.

10:58.538 --> 11:02.390
Image number one: Frenchman
on bicycle carrying baguettes.

11:05.394 --> 11:08.396
No visible reaction.

11:08.398 --> 11:10.765
Image number two: sousaphone.

11:13.235 --> 11:14.736
Still no reaction.

11:14.738 --> 11:15.737
Okay.

11:15.739 --> 11:17.372
Let's kick things up a notch.

11:17.374 --> 11:20.091
Image number three: crocodile
with a mouthful of monkeys.

11:24.079 --> 11:27.132
Okay, now we're talking.

11:27.134 --> 11:29.067
Dr. Fowler?

11:29.069 --> 11:31.136
What do you want, Sheldon?

11:31.138 --> 11:33.221
Well, I'm done
with work, so...

11:34.424 --> 11:36.358
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

11:36.360 --> 11:39.093
Sorry. Uh...

11:39.095 --> 11:40.528
Better?

11:40.530 --> 11:41.696
Oh, baguettes.

11:41.698 --> 11:43.898
Yes, I like baguettes.

11:43.900 --> 11:46.100
What exactly
are you doing?

11:46.102 --> 11:48.536
Determining baseline fear levels
in capuchin monkeys

11:48.538 --> 11:50.872
by measuring their response
to visual stimuli.

11:50.874 --> 11:52.340
So, goofing off.

11:54.910 --> 11:57.579
As I was saying, I'm done
with work and Leonard's not.

11:57.581 --> 12:00.215
So good news,
you get to take me home.

12:00.217 --> 12:01.249
Play your cards right,

12:01.251 --> 12:02.751
I'll let you drive me

12:02.753 --> 12:05.837
past the lot
where the buses park at night.

12:05.839 --> 12:07.639
I can't leave now, Sheldon.

12:07.641 --> 12:08.757
I'm very busy.

12:08.759 --> 12:10.558
Besides, why would I want
to do you a favor

12:10.560 --> 12:12.577
after the way you treated
me in the cafeteria?

12:12.579 --> 12:15.129
Image number four:
boa constrictor.

12:18.968 --> 12:21.936
What on earth
are you talking about?

12:21.938 --> 12:23.488
My behavior
in the cafeteria

12:23.490 --> 12:25.306
was delightful.

12:25.308 --> 12:27.492
Maybe your friend
Gunderson needs

12:27.494 --> 12:29.444
to head over
to IKEA and assemble

12:29.446 --> 12:32.380
a sense of humor.

12:32.382 --> 12:34.365
You embarrassed me
in front of my colleagues

12:34.367 --> 12:35.983
on my first day here.

12:36.685 --> 12:37.786
Image number five:

12:37.788 --> 12:39.187
kitten in a teacup.

12:39.189 --> 12:41.389
Oh.

12:44.960 --> 12:47.529
Oh... embarrassed you?
You know what?

12:47.531 --> 12:50.432
I don't have time for this.
Find another way home.

12:50.434 --> 12:53.451
I'm starting to get the sense
that you're angry with me.

12:53.453 --> 12:55.002
Really?
What tipped you off?

12:55.004 --> 12:56.054
Couple things, actually.

12:56.056 --> 12:57.171
Your tone of voice,
your body language...

12:57.173 --> 12:58.807
Get out.
Well, now, that.

13:00.676 --> 13:03.311
Image number six:
woman giving birth.

13:12.571 --> 13:14.188
It's 9:00.
Where you been?

13:14.190 --> 13:17.308
Oh, I had to take
the bus home.

13:17.310 --> 13:20.845
Fell asleep and missed my stop.

13:20.847 --> 13:22.647
Oh, no.

13:22.649 --> 13:26.634
Did you know that Los Angeles
has a Little Sri Lanka?

13:26.636 --> 13:28.987
I did not.

13:28.989 --> 13:31.005
Well, I do... now.

13:31.007 --> 13:33.708
They're a lovely people.

13:33.710 --> 13:37.378
Although terrifying when you
wake up face-to-face with them.

13:38.380 --> 13:39.647
If you're hungry, I brought home

13:39.649 --> 13:41.633
some mutton and coconut milk.

13:41.635 --> 13:43.618
Why'd you get that?
You hate lamb.

13:43.620 --> 13:45.687
I was asking for directions.

13:45.689 --> 13:49.207
Apparently, there was
a communication problem.

13:49.209 --> 13:52.327
I thought Amy was gonna
drive you home.

13:52.329 --> 13:53.611
Yeah, I thought so, too,

13:53.613 --> 13:55.780
but she's acting very strangely.

13:55.782 --> 13:58.783
I was discussing it with
a Sri Lankan fellow on the bus,

13:58.785 --> 14:01.870
and he hypothesized
that a tiger may have

14:01.872 --> 14:04.055
recently run across her shadow.

14:05.908 --> 14:08.343
Although he may have just been
trying to drum up business

14:08.345 --> 14:11.346
for his brother-in-law's
witch doctor practice.

14:14.266 --> 14:16.835
Okay, Sheldon, what happened
between you and Amy?

14:16.837 --> 14:20.572
Well, can you believe
she said I embarrassed her?

14:20.574 --> 14:22.657
Yeah.

14:22.659 --> 14:25.443
But you didn't
even hear the details.

14:25.445 --> 14:27.478
Sheldon...

14:29.248 --> 14:31.866
I've known you
a long time,

14:31.868 --> 14:33.284
and I'm going
to tell you this

14:33.286 --> 14:37.155
with all the love
I can possibly muster.

14:37.157 --> 14:38.156
Amy's right.

14:38.158 --> 14:39.607
You're wrong.

14:40.459 --> 14:41.659
But you don't even know...

14:41.661 --> 14:43.077
Doesn't matter.

14:43.079 --> 14:45.697
But, now, but in my defense...
Doesn't matter.

14:45.699 --> 14:47.932
You're not listening
to my side of it.

14:47.934 --> 14:50.268
Okay, fine, Sheldon.
What is your side?

14:50.270 --> 14:52.286
Well...

14:52.288 --> 14:54.789
Nope, got to go with
Amy on this one.

15:00.630 --> 15:01.679
Shrimp was spicy.

15:01.681 --> 15:03.114
You want a TUMS?

15:03.116 --> 15:04.432
You got
the tropical fruit kind?

15:04.434 --> 15:06.951
No, if I buy those, I just
go through them like candy.

15:06.953 --> 15:08.386
Tell me about it.

15:08.388 --> 15:11.105
One time, I swear
I pooped out a stick of chalk.

15:13.142 --> 15:15.360
I'll get it.
Thanks.

15:17.279 --> 15:18.363
Hi.

15:18.365 --> 15:19.530
Oh, hi.

15:19.532 --> 15:21.699
I may have overreacted.

15:21.701 --> 15:25.620
Yeah, well, I didn't
handle it so great, either.

15:25.622 --> 15:28.039
It's just sometimes I feel
like you enjoy spending time

15:28.041 --> 15:30.091
with your friends
more than with me.

15:30.093 --> 15:31.910
That's not true.
It's not?

15:31.912 --> 15:33.595
You spend all day
together at work,

15:33.597 --> 15:35.713
and then you all hang out
at night playing games,

15:35.715 --> 15:37.231
going to the comic book store.

15:37.233 --> 15:39.851
Last week, you two got
a couples massage.

15:42.488 --> 15:45.056
So, when you said you wouldn't
want to spend that much time

15:45.058 --> 15:48.026
with me, it really
hurt my feelings.

15:48.028 --> 15:49.644
Oh, wow.

15:49.646 --> 15:50.979
Yeah, no, I get that.

15:50.981 --> 15:52.113
I'm so sorry.

15:52.115 --> 15:54.866
Starting tomorrow, I am
turning over a new leaf.

15:54.868 --> 15:57.986
Time with you is my
number one priority.

15:59.990 --> 16:01.689
Why tomorrow?

16:03.191 --> 16:05.510
Well, we're real close
to finishing off

16:05.512 --> 16:07.378
the new Batman game.

16:08.514 --> 16:11.666
It is awesome.

16:13.969 --> 16:16.004
Uh, you should probably
go after her.

16:16.006 --> 16:17.755
Should I go after you?

16:17.757 --> 16:19.924
No!

16:21.593 --> 16:24.095
Thanks for getting me
in trouble.

16:26.899 --> 16:28.266
Amy.

16:29.068 --> 16:30.284
Amy.

16:31.070 --> 16:33.104
Amy.

16:34.723 --> 16:37.325
Sheldon, what are you
doing here so late?

16:37.327 --> 16:39.193
I couldn't sleep
because I kept thinking

16:39.195 --> 16:41.446
about what happened
earlier between us.

16:42.247 --> 16:45.616
Also, I had one heck
of a bus nap.

16:46.752 --> 16:47.902
Oh, speaking of which,

16:47.904 --> 16:50.788
do you want some mutton
and coconut milk?

16:50.790 --> 16:51.856
No.

16:51.858 --> 16:54.625
Well, I cannot give
this stuff away.

16:54.627 --> 16:57.078
What do you want?

16:57.080 --> 17:00.648
Amy, this isn't easy to say.

17:01.767 --> 17:04.752
All relationships are difficult,

17:04.753 --> 17:07.689
but even more so
when you're in one

17:07.691 --> 17:09.523
with a person who struggles

17:09.526 --> 17:11.858
with everyday
social interactions.

17:11.861 --> 17:13.528
And frankly...

17:13.530 --> 17:15.146
who can strike some people

17:15.147 --> 17:17.665
as being kind of a weirdo.

17:17.666 --> 17:19.650
Sheldon...

17:19.652 --> 17:21.652
you're not a weirdo.

17:21.654 --> 17:24.271
I wasn't speaking about me.

17:26.308 --> 17:28.442
I mean, honestly,
there's no telling

17:28.444 --> 17:30.078
what will set you off.

17:30.080 --> 17:32.296
You know, introducing
myself as your boyfriend.

17:32.298 --> 17:35.550
Giving you the opportunity
to drive me home.

17:35.552 --> 17:37.618
Breaking the ice
with your colleagues

17:37.620 --> 17:40.788
using ethnic humor,
the funniest kind of humor.

17:42.558 --> 17:44.225
What's your point?

17:44.227 --> 17:46.627
My point is, we're a couple.

17:46.629 --> 17:48.362
And...

17:48.364 --> 17:50.481
I like you for who you are.

17:50.483 --> 17:52.366
Quirks and all.

17:54.103 --> 17:55.653
I like you, too.

17:55.655 --> 17:58.189
Well, I should hope so.

17:58.191 --> 18:00.324
I don't see anyone else
banging on this door

18:00.326 --> 18:02.827
to put up with your nonsense.

18:06.982 --> 18:09.584
Not even a good-bye?

18:09.586 --> 18:11.085
You see,
that's the kind of thing

18:11.087 --> 18:13.621
that makes people
think you're weird.

18:13.623 --> 18:15.423
Poor kid.

18:15.425 --> 18:17.508
She just doesn't see it.

18:27.609 --> 18:28.692
I'm not apologizing
to Howard.

18:28.694 --> 18:30.343
He can come beg me
on his knees.

18:30.345 --> 18:31.695
Sheldon, too.

18:31.697 --> 18:34.197
If I see him at work,
I'm just going to ignore him.

18:34.199 --> 18:36.033
All right, don't worry.
I talked to Leonard.

18:36.035 --> 18:38.802
He is gonna sit the guys down
and set them straight.

18:38.804 --> 18:40.821
Laser's warmed up.

18:40.897 --> 18:41.929
