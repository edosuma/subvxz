00:48.924 --> 00:50.631
Hail Mary, full of grace.

00:50.717 --> 00:52.003
The Lord is with thee.

00:52.094 --> 00:53.460
Blessed art thou amongst women,

00:53.554 --> 00:55.841
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

00:56.390 --> 00:58.131
Holy Mary, Mother of God,

00:58.225 --> 00:59.136
pray for us sinners,

00:59.226 --> 01:01.934
now and at the hour of our death, Amen.

01:02.020 --> 01:03.977
Hail Mary, full of grace,

01:04.063 --> 01:05.474
The Lord is with thee.

01:05.566 --> 01:07.603
Blessed art thou amongst women,

01:07.693 --> 01:10.310
blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

01:10.404 --> 01:12.191
Holy Mary, Mother of God,

01:12.281 --> 01:13.362
pray for us sinners,

01:13.448 --> 01:15.155
now and at the hour of our death.

01:15.242 --> 01:17.154
Amen.

01:53.322 --> 01:54.312
Hello?

01:57.409 --> 01:58.399
Hey.

02:00.746 --> 02:02.408
There's a switch right behind your head

02:02.497 --> 02:03.704
- if you want...
- Switch?

02:03.790 --> 02:04.871
The switch for the light.

02:04.958 --> 02:06.324
It's right behind your head
if you want to...

02:06.418 --> 02:08.785
Oh. I'm good.

02:09.880 --> 02:10.791
Okay.

02:16.845 --> 02:18.802
- Whenever you're ready.
- Okay.

02:18.889 --> 02:22.098
Aren't you supposed to, like,
ask me for a sin list

02:22.184 --> 02:24.346
and call me a child
or a lamb or some shit?

02:25.020 --> 02:28.058
Thing. Something. Sorry.

02:28.899 --> 02:30.106
It's your first time?

02:30.192 --> 02:31.308
How did you guess?

02:33.236 --> 02:34.818
There aren't any real rules to this.

02:35.280 --> 02:36.316
I'm just here to help.

02:36.907 --> 02:38.569
With what, exactly?

02:38.659 --> 02:40.116
Your relationship with God.

02:40.202 --> 02:42.410
Oh...

02:43.747 --> 02:44.658
Sorry.

02:45.082 --> 02:46.539
Again.

02:46.625 --> 02:48.241
Don't apologize. This is for you.

02:51.421 --> 02:52.332
Okay.

02:53.715 --> 02:56.253
Well, thing is...

02:57.010 --> 02:58.000
I'm dying.

03:03.141 --> 03:04.052
I'm sorry.

03:05.435 --> 03:06.721
You're probably thinking,

03:07.145 --> 03:09.933
this chick's trying to clear the deck
at the last minute or whatever,

03:10.023 --> 03:13.858
you know, hit the redo button
on the way out, but...

03:13.944 --> 03:15.105
I'm not here to judge you.

03:15.195 --> 03:17.232
And that's great, and everything,

03:17.322 --> 03:19.359
but I'm really not here
to save my own ass.

03:19.449 --> 03:22.567
I'm here for a practical reason
as opposed to spiritual.

03:22.661 --> 03:23.492
What would that be?

03:23.578 --> 03:24.614
Funeral arrangements.

03:25.080 --> 03:26.742
This isn't usually how that...

03:26.832 --> 03:29.370
I'm sure you've got a guy
I'm supposed to call...

03:30.168 --> 03:32.956
or maybe a website.

03:33.672 --> 03:35.504
I just... I don't know
how much time I have left,

03:35.590 --> 03:39.004
and I really don't want to spend it
planning an event

03:39.094 --> 03:40.881
I'm not even going to be able to attend.

03:43.598 --> 03:45.180
I want a nice casket.

03:47.519 --> 03:51.729
Nothing too over the top,
but not boring either.

03:54.985 --> 03:56.977
The kind of casket
that makes people think,

03:57.863 --> 04:00.731
"Wow, it's a shame she died so young."

04:02.909 --> 04:04.775
But I don't want it to elicit tears.

04:05.120 --> 04:06.031
Just enough...

04:07.414 --> 04:08.325
you know...

04:09.249 --> 04:10.410
whatever you call it...

04:10.751 --> 04:12.413
so they'll miss me in that, um...

04:13.420 --> 04:16.083
that fond memory kind of way.

04:20.969 --> 04:22.210
I really am sorry.

04:23.972 --> 04:24.883
Thank you.

04:26.016 --> 04:27.302
I may have needed this.

04:30.812 --> 04:32.474
Definitely needed something.

04:37.736 --> 04:38.852
This is what I do.

04:39.988 --> 04:43.572
Yeah, well,
this seems to be what I do, too.

04:44.409 --> 04:45.900
As far as pallbearers go,

04:45.994 --> 04:46.984
are those included

04:47.078 --> 04:49.195
or should I make a list of ex-boyfriends

04:49.289 --> 04:50.951
with decent upper-body strength?

04:51.041 --> 04:51.952
Um, I...

04:52.667 --> 04:54.499
- I think that you should probably...
- Screw it.

04:54.586 --> 04:55.576
I'll do cremation.

04:56.421 --> 04:57.457
Thanks again for listening.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.381
You sound nice.

07:19.522 --> 07:21.730
I keep hearing some sort of reverb.

07:21.816 --> 07:23.557
Reverb's not the problem.

07:23.652 --> 07:24.893
It's like a flange or...

07:24.986 --> 07:26.898
- I'm-I'm hearing something.
- There's no flange.

07:27.322 --> 07:28.654
Do you even know what a flange is?

07:28.740 --> 07:32.233
Maybe the problem is that our equipment

07:32.327 --> 07:36.162
happens to amplify
your vocal imperfections.

07:36.247 --> 07:39.661
Full disclosure. I haven't had an
opportunity to read the manual

07:39.751 --> 07:42.960
but I don't think
this piece of equipment comes

07:43.046 --> 07:45.333
with a setting for drowning out jealousy

07:46.091 --> 07:48.048
because I think you're jealous,

07:49.052 --> 07:50.213
is what I'm trying to say.

07:53.515 --> 07:55.051
Of... Of my singing.

08:30.051 --> 08:30.962
Was I flat again?

08:37.017 --> 08:37.928
Hmm.

09:01.458 --> 09:03.324
<i>Death is everywhere.</i>

09:03.418 --> 09:05.000
<i>We can try to run from it,</i>

09:05.086 --> 09:06.327
<i>deny it,</i>

09:06.421 --> 09:07.707
<i>hide away</i>

09:07.797 --> 09:10.540
<i>in the most articulate,
philosophical explanations</i>

09:10.633 --> 09:12.670
<i>that man has been coming up with
since, well...</i>

09:13.636 --> 09:14.547
<i>man.</i>

09:14.929 --> 09:16.761
The Bible certainly has
a lot to say about it.

09:16.848 --> 09:19.591
Trust me, I know. I've skimmed
the book more than a few times.

09:24.814 --> 09:25.804
The truth is...

09:27.901 --> 09:29.984
is that the more I think about death,

09:30.070 --> 09:32.062
the less I seem to really understand it.

09:33.907 --> 09:34.818
And guess what.

09:36.868 --> 09:37.779
That's okay.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.697
Because knowing
that our time here is limited,

09:43.083 --> 09:44.949
that's what makes it matter so much.

09:46.127 --> 09:47.163
Good, Daniel.

09:50.131 --> 09:51.372
Most inspiring one yet.

09:52.634 --> 09:54.000
You don't think it was a little dark?

09:54.511 --> 09:56.423
Well, Matthew made it dark.

09:56.721 --> 09:58.883
You're just commenting on the writing.

09:59.891 --> 10:01.007
You got a gift.

10:02.310 --> 10:05.803
It reminds me
of a younger version of myself.

10:05.897 --> 10:09.311
It doesn't mean they'll laugh
at the Bible skimming bit.

10:09.400 --> 10:10.311
Well, I just thought that...

10:10.401 --> 10:13.644
You thought that it was funny enough
for a laugh pause.

10:13.738 --> 10:17.072
I mean, maybe a slight smile,

10:18.034 --> 10:19.821
a courtesy chuckle,

10:20.328 --> 10:21.318
but a laugh pause?

10:21.412 --> 10:22.619
What if I work on the timing...

10:22.705 --> 10:27.325
I've only been
with this parish for 30 years,

10:27.418 --> 10:29.330
and you, just-just over one.

10:31.464 --> 10:33.706
I'm sure going with your gut
is the right call.

10:37.512 --> 10:39.469
Oh, come on, come on.

10:39.556 --> 10:40.842
What, Father?

10:40.932 --> 10:44.596
Why... even the Franciscans have...
have some rules about... this.

10:45.645 --> 10:46.726
Let me check, Father.

10:49.274 --> 10:50.560
And cometh game day,

10:50.650 --> 10:52.266
'tis okay to go forth

10:52.360 --> 10:55.068
in the colors of thine chosen team

10:55.155 --> 10:57.021
unless thine chosen team

10:57.115 --> 11:00.199
is the Purdue Boilermakers
or the Kentucky Wildcats.

11:01.494 --> 11:02.405
God is good.

11:03.037 --> 11:05.450
Tip off's in five minutes.
I'm making my nachos.

11:07.709 --> 11:10.702
You never told me
how the Friday-night confession went.

11:13.464 --> 11:15.706
Oh, it was... fine.

11:15.800 --> 11:16.711
There was uh...

11:17.552 --> 11:18.463
It was nothing.

11:18.803 --> 11:19.714
It was fine.

11:21.181 --> 11:22.046
Daniel?

11:22.140 --> 11:25.178
Oh, the game's about to start.

11:25.268 --> 11:26.429
I should probably...

11:27.187 --> 11:29.224
He would have been proud
of who you've become.

11:30.064 --> 11:30.975
Your dad.

11:34.694 --> 11:35.901
Have a good night, Father.

11:43.995 --> 11:44.951
Hmm.

11:49.292 --> 11:50.373
Skimmed the book.

11:56.799 --> 11:58.756
<i>Rivers crosses over...</i>

11:59.928 --> 12:02.636
Are you serious? Did you see that?

12:02.722 --> 12:03.929
- Come on!
- Did you see that?

12:04.015 --> 12:07.429
- Shoot the... three pointer.
- For the Love of God.

12:07.518 --> 12:10.135
Basket. Dunk.

12:11.314 --> 12:15.433
Father, you're from here, yes?

12:15.526 --> 12:17.939
- Yeah.
- How do you not love basketball?

12:18.029 --> 12:20.521
I think it's definitely a b...
a good way of...

12:20.615 --> 12:22.652
Okay, okay, okay, okay, tell me this.

12:22.742 --> 12:23.778
W- What's-What's your thing?

12:23.868 --> 12:25.325
- My thing?
- You know, your thing,

12:25.411 --> 12:27.949
like I... I played
third string power forward

12:28.039 --> 12:29.530
on myjunior high basketball team.

12:29.624 --> 12:33.208
I went on to never actually make
another squad after that,

12:33.294 --> 12:36.458
so that now I live through them.

12:36.547 --> 12:38.914
Delusional hoop dreams and saturated fat...

12:39.008 --> 12:40.795
that's my thing. What's yours?

12:40.885 --> 12:43.593
Uh, I... Yeah, I guess, I mean... God.

12:46.474 --> 12:48.306
- God what?
- God's my thing.

12:49.102 --> 12:50.684
What?

12:50.770 --> 12:52.762
- No.
- Why is that... What no?

12:52.855 --> 12:55.814
Look, you gotta... you gotta find
something of your own,

12:55.900 --> 12:58.563
something selfish and stupid and...

12:59.696 --> 13:00.561
human.

13:00.655 --> 13:03.648
Otherwise you just might wind up
like Victor.

13:05.076 --> 13:05.987
What's wrong with that?

13:06.953 --> 13:08.364
He wears his collar to Target.

13:08.454 --> 13:10.320
I mean, he literally puts on his collar

13:10.415 --> 13:12.907
to buy Honey Nut Cheerios
and toilet paper.

13:13.001 --> 13:13.957
Now, that's weird.

13:14.460 --> 13:15.371
That's weird.

13:16.879 --> 13:18.745
Don't... Don't be weird.

13:18.840 --> 13:20.923
And don't bring that shit in the lane!

13:21.009 --> 13:22.966
Oh, do not bring that shit in the lane!

13:23.052 --> 13:24.293
Do not bring that shit in the lane.

13:24.387 --> 13:27.255
- Yeah!
- That's what I am talking about. Okay.

13:27.348 --> 13:28.259
Mm.

13:29.100 --> 13:30.386
Welcome to Hoosier Basketball.

13:31.477 --> 13:32.388
All the best, Father.

15:02.068 --> 15:03.149
Am I late?

15:05.113 --> 15:07.400
I'm sorry, are you lost or...

15:07.490 --> 15:09.152
This is Saint Martin's, right?

15:09.826 --> 15:10.737
Mark's.

15:11.077 --> 15:11.988
I'm Jane.

15:12.286 --> 15:14.619
No, it's Saint Marks. The church.

15:15.623 --> 15:18.331
I'm still Jane. The person.

15:19.419 --> 15:21.206
Daniel. Father Daniel.

15:21.295 --> 15:24.003
- Nice to meet you, Father Daniel.
- Nice to meet you...

15:24.841 --> 15:25.752
Jane.

15:28.052 --> 15:30.920
We're very far apart.

15:34.058 --> 15:35.970
Permission to approach the priest?

15:36.060 --> 15:39.394
Uh, well, you don't really need
to ask permission, but...

15:39.480 --> 15:41.267
it's... okay.

15:41.357 --> 15:43.019
So what's the verdict, Father?

15:43.109 --> 15:44.099
Verdict?

15:44.193 --> 15:45.354
Is it too late?

15:45.445 --> 15:47.186
- For...
- Confession.

15:47.280 --> 15:48.646
- Oh.
- You guys are open late

15:48.739 --> 15:49.570
on Fridays, now, right?

15:49.657 --> 15:52.616
You were the... uh, one from last week.

15:52.702 --> 15:53.613
No.

15:54.370 --> 15:55.281
Yeah.

15:56.247 --> 15:57.158
Maybe.

15:58.416 --> 15:59.327
Yeah.

16:00.376 --> 16:01.366
I recognize your voice.

16:01.461 --> 16:03.953
Distinctive, right? I'm a singer. I sing.

16:04.046 --> 16:05.878
No big deal. I'm good, though.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.501
But let's not make
a whole thing out of it...

16:07.592 --> 16:08.833
Confession was supposed to end
at 2:00 and...

16:08.926 --> 16:10.792
- I can go.
- No, it's just we're very...

16:11.929 --> 16:14.012
- very big on rules around here.
- It's cool. Really.

16:14.098 --> 16:15.805
- And so I think...
- I'll just order some absolution

16:15.892 --> 16:17.975
- with my Taco Bell.
- I meant... Wait, I... I...

16:18.978 --> 16:21.686
I can... I mean, we can...

16:22.482 --> 16:23.518
Thanks, Father.

16:25.860 --> 16:26.771
Daniel.

16:27.487 --> 16:28.648
Can I call you Daniel?

16:31.908 --> 16:33.615
- Uh...
- We'll figure it out in there.

16:52.220 --> 16:54.553
So... maybe we should start talking...

16:54.639 --> 16:56.255
I can't do cremation, Daniel.

16:56.849 --> 16:57.760
I just can't.

16:58.851 --> 17:00.558
I thought about it, and it's like...

17:02.313 --> 17:03.724
what the hell was I thinking?

17:05.775 --> 17:09.644
- Maybe we should start with who your...
- Who's gonna dress me?

17:09.904 --> 17:10.815
What?

17:11.531 --> 17:13.568
Now that we're back
to the standard funeral,

17:13.657 --> 17:15.319
I've got to think about who, you know...

17:16.577 --> 17:19.069
No way I'm letting a creepy funeral-y guy

17:19.163 --> 17:21.576
put me in some kind of sad death smock.

17:21.665 --> 17:23.531
And if my mom got involved...

17:24.752 --> 17:25.663
my God.

17:26.503 --> 17:28.587
She drives one of those Mary Kay cars,

17:28.965 --> 17:30.172
you know, those pink atrocities

17:30.258 --> 17:33.501
they only give
their most celebrated salespeople?

17:35.346 --> 17:38.214
She'd have me wearing a floral pants suit,

17:39.183 --> 17:41.721
and she'd splash so much paint on my face

17:41.811 --> 17:45.350
that I'd look like a transvestite,

17:45.439 --> 17:48.102
prostitute version of Blanche DuBois...

17:48.192 --> 17:49.524
- Why are you here?
- What?

17:51.195 --> 17:53.812
I'm sorry, but last week,

17:53.906 --> 17:55.772
tonight, why?

17:58.244 --> 17:59.075
What do you mean?

17:59.161 --> 18:00.777
Is this really about funeral arrangements?

18:03.249 --> 18:04.615
You don't believe I'm dying?

18:04.709 --> 18:06.291
Wha... that's not what I... I mean...

18:09.964 --> 18:10.875
Are you?

18:13.134 --> 18:14.841
This was a stupid idea.

18:14.927 --> 18:16.384
- Jane...
- I should go.

18:18.931 --> 18:20.342
You came here for a reason.

18:20.766 --> 18:21.677
Here.

18:23.978 --> 18:24.889
Why?

18:34.363 --> 18:35.353
You were open.

18:38.784 --> 18:41.367
And no, I'm not lost,
in case you're wondering.

18:41.454 --> 18:43.320
I'm just... I'm done with it.

18:45.458 --> 18:46.369
I'm done.

18:50.087 --> 18:51.248
Everything around me...

18:51.964 --> 18:52.875
I see it...

18:54.508 --> 18:55.669
and it's all the same.

18:58.888 --> 19:00.220
Nothing.

19:03.267 --> 19:05.975
And it's not that I don't give a shit,
or that I'm giving up.

19:06.937 --> 19:07.848
It's just...

19:08.981 --> 19:10.062
It's disappointing.

19:11.651 --> 19:12.767
No...

19:16.739 --> 19:17.729
heartbreaking.

19:20.826 --> 19:22.237
And there aren't enough cat videos

19:22.328 --> 19:24.820
or fucking TED talks on YouTube
to make up for that.

19:27.875 --> 19:28.865
So when...

19:29.543 --> 19:32.035
faced with all the possible
things left to contemplate...

19:33.381 --> 19:37.842
death feels like one of the
last remaining ideas we have

19:37.927 --> 19:39.884
to... to remind us of...

19:42.098 --> 19:43.009
- of...
- Life?

19:52.024 --> 19:53.856
That light you have outside...

19:53.943 --> 19:54.979
What?

19:55.069 --> 19:56.901
The one over the front door of the church.

19:58.572 --> 20:00.905
It was on when I happened
to walk by last week.

20:00.991 --> 20:01.981
That's why I'm here.

20:10.376 --> 20:12.163
- What about a photo?
- What?

20:12.586 --> 20:13.497
For the funeral.

20:14.338 --> 20:15.920
Sort of a template

20:16.006 --> 20:17.998
for what it is you kind of
want to look like.

20:18.092 --> 20:19.958
- Now, that's not a bad idea.
- Yeah.

20:21.262 --> 20:22.924
You don't think that's too stagey?

20:23.013 --> 20:25.972
Well, the Catholic Church has never
shied away from a little pageantry.

20:26.058 --> 20:27.048
Yeah...

20:27.143 --> 20:29.009
I've seen the crucifix.

20:29.103 --> 20:30.685
- That's not really what I was referring...
- Too soon?

20:32.481 --> 20:33.688
That was kind of too soon.

20:35.609 --> 20:37.942
You gotta wait till at least 3,000 years.

20:38.779 --> 20:41.146
But, I mean, come on.
They put makeup on Jesus.

20:41.574 --> 20:42.815
- No, they don't.
- Yeah, they do.

20:42.908 --> 20:43.944
When do they put makeup on Jesus?

20:44.034 --> 20:45.650
Have you looked at any of the crucifixes

20:45.745 --> 20:46.826
where he's got kind, like, blush on

20:46.912 --> 20:48.198
and some eyeliner?

20:48.289 --> 20:49.825
It's hot in the sun.

20:49.915 --> 20:50.746
Um, no.

20:50.833 --> 20:52.449
They're making him look pretty.

20:52.543 --> 20:55.126
He looks like a woman in some of those.

20:55.463 --> 20:57.125
Which is not all that weird

20:57.214 --> 20:59.126
because, you know, maybe... who knows?

20:59.550 --> 21:01.462
"Hey-soos" would be glad
that you figured it out.

21:01.552 --> 21:03.088
That's how you say His name in Spanish...

21:12.897 --> 21:15.310
"He... He answereth and saith unto them,

21:15.399 --> 21:19.564
"'Let him that hath two coats impart
to him that hath none.

21:19.653 --> 21:21.940
And let him that hath meat...'"

21:22.782 --> 21:24.114
baby, do the same.

21:24.533 --> 21:25.649
Luke 3:11.

21:26.494 --> 21:27.530
How do you like me now?

21:29.121 --> 21:30.032
Father.

21:30.623 --> 21:31.659
Father.

21:35.878 --> 21:37.085
No run today?

21:37.588 --> 21:38.544
I guess I slept in.

21:39.048 --> 21:40.835
- Is everything okay?
- Y-Yeah, yeah.

21:40.925 --> 21:42.632
No, yeah. Just tired.

21:44.178 --> 21:45.089
Victor...

21:46.013 --> 21:47.800
surely you have a verse in there

21:47.890 --> 21:49.597
about the evils of hitting
the snooze button.

21:49.683 --> 21:52.676
Mm-hm. Are the late Fridays
a bit too much?

21:52.770 --> 21:55.183
- No, not at all.
- I'll talk to the Bishop.

21:55.272 --> 21:57.184
No, I-I... you were right.

21:57.274 --> 21:58.981
It's been... It's been really...

21:59.068 --> 22:01.025
It's good. It's very good.

22:01.111 --> 22:02.022
For me.

22:02.822 --> 22:04.154
- Daniel...
- You know, we get to reach out

22:04.240 --> 22:05.356
to different, uh...

22:06.867 --> 22:07.823
So yeah.

22:09.537 --> 22:10.448
Yeah.

22:15.000 --> 22:15.911
Okay.

22:21.215 --> 22:23.548
My problem is that he'll tell his mother

22:23.634 --> 22:25.546
every little detail about our life.

22:25.636 --> 22:29.425
But with me,
it's just I think that he has a problem

22:29.515 --> 22:30.551
with communication.

22:30.641 --> 22:32.883
And that
is what he really needs to work on.

22:32.977 --> 22:34.138
And he knows that already

22:34.228 --> 22:35.639
because I tell him all the time,

22:35.729 --> 22:38.392
but he just goes about his day
like he doesn't even hear me,

22:38.482 --> 22:40.940
which, you can imagine, doesn't feel good

22:41.026 --> 22:43.439
when I'm trying to express my feelings,

22:43.529 --> 22:47.523
which I believe is at the core
of the problem with the marriage,

22:47.616 --> 22:49.653
not to say
that we don't have a good marriage,

22:49.743 --> 22:51.109
because we do.

22:51.203 --> 22:55.163
It's just I thought that if we talked
to someone within the Church,

22:55.249 --> 22:58.538
it might better open up
the lines of communication between...

22:59.378 --> 23:00.494
- Father!
- Yes.

23:01.589 --> 23:02.750
Yes what?

23:07.511 --> 23:09.377
Yes, what he said. Yes.

23:14.977 --> 23:16.388
Yes, I apologized.

23:17.354 --> 23:19.061
I listened to her for another hour...

23:19.148 --> 23:20.184
without interruption...

23:21.191 --> 23:23.524
and of course I assured her
that it would never happen again.

23:24.278 --> 23:25.564
This is not like you.

23:26.322 --> 23:27.358
I know.

23:28.449 --> 23:33.160
We've discussed the importance of detail.

23:35.289 --> 23:38.077
It's the reason why I do even this,

23:38.167 --> 23:41.877
instead of letting
some sacristan housewife...

23:42.796 --> 23:43.707
God bless them...

23:44.340 --> 23:47.549
improperly dress my alter.

23:47.635 --> 23:48.751
I'm sorry, Father.

23:49.553 --> 23:51.215
Do you feel His presence, Daniel?

23:51.972 --> 23:53.884
Yes, of course. Always.

23:56.810 --> 23:57.971
It's okay to say no.

23:58.896 --> 23:59.807
Yeah, I know.

24:03.442 --> 24:04.978
Wait a minute. How is it okay?

24:05.069 --> 24:06.651
This isn't magic.

24:06.737 --> 24:07.693
We are not special.

24:07.780 --> 24:12.024
Nor do we have
some privileged access to God.

24:13.410 --> 24:16.528
We are men who chose to serve.

24:17.665 --> 24:20.829
Whether or not we see

24:21.210 --> 24:23.668
or hear or feel Him

24:23.754 --> 24:26.087
at any given time is not the point.

24:27.091 --> 24:29.754
Our job is to be ever present for him.

24:31.178 --> 24:32.259
The day to day,

24:32.888 --> 24:34.095
the minute to minute.

24:35.182 --> 24:36.093
This moment.

24:37.267 --> 24:38.178
Now.

24:38.769 --> 24:39.680
The details?

24:40.437 --> 24:41.427
Exactly.

24:44.984 --> 24:45.895
Do you?

24:46.902 --> 24:47.813
Do I what?

24:48.988 --> 24:50.149
See God?

24:51.865 --> 24:52.776
Yes.

24:55.077 --> 24:56.067
Sometimes.

25:39.121 --> 25:40.453
- A-2.
- Miss.

25:40.539 --> 25:41.780
Really?

25:42.541 --> 25:43.702
I don't cheat at Battleship,

25:43.792 --> 25:45.033
and if I was going to start,

25:45.127 --> 25:46.663
it wouldn't be in this building.

25:47.421 --> 25:48.878
Oh, and, um...

25:50.174 --> 25:52.962
C-6, by the way.

25:55.304 --> 25:57.091
You sunk my battleship.

25:57.181 --> 26:00.174
Oh, three losses in a row.

26:00.684 --> 26:01.720
Ouch.

26:02.227 --> 26:03.559
I wasn't really counting.

26:04.146 --> 26:06.684
Not to be, you know, but I'm...

26:07.608 --> 26:09.816
I'm totally dominating this confession.

26:14.364 --> 26:15.275
What?

26:16.408 --> 26:17.489
You haven't really...

26:18.911 --> 26:22.279
I mean, I don't feel like
I'm really doing my job here.

26:22.372 --> 26:23.829
I know I'm not, actually.

26:23.916 --> 26:25.282
Do you want me to confess something?

26:25.375 --> 26:26.286
No.

26:27.377 --> 26:29.084
I mean, not unless you want to.

26:29.171 --> 26:31.083
I don't want you to feel
like it's required.

26:31.173 --> 26:33.256
There is something.

26:33.550 --> 26:34.461
What?

26:38.764 --> 26:39.845
You can say anything.

26:39.932 --> 26:40.922
I know, but...

26:42.226 --> 26:43.933
I'm just afraid that if I tell you,

26:44.019 --> 26:46.432
I don't know, things might change.

26:46.522 --> 26:48.479
- What things?
- Just... things...

26:48.732 --> 26:49.643
between us.

26:53.112 --> 26:54.023
Jane...

26:55.280 --> 26:57.067
Promise you won't hate me?

26:59.284 --> 27:00.195
I promise.

27:01.328 --> 27:02.239
Thing is...

27:03.956 --> 27:05.538
I've been trying to find a way
to say this all night.

27:05.624 --> 27:07.035
I just... Oh, I don't know.

27:08.168 --> 27:09.079
I...

27:10.546 --> 27:11.457
I...

27:13.423 --> 27:15.335
I totally cheated.

27:17.636 --> 27:18.547
What?

27:19.096 --> 27:20.587
The first game was actually close,

27:20.681 --> 27:22.968
and I just... I lied a bit.

27:23.934 --> 27:26.267
Didn't even place my ships
in the next two.

27:28.689 --> 27:29.679
You hate me?

27:30.524 --> 27:31.435
Why would I hate you?

27:31.733 --> 27:34.851
Just seems like I'm always sitting
on my... you know...

27:35.737 --> 27:38.195
sinner half and...

27:38.991 --> 27:40.402
you have to listen to all of my...

27:42.161 --> 27:43.072
What about you?

27:43.370 --> 27:44.281
Me?

27:45.289 --> 27:46.746
You ever get a chance to sit on this side?

27:46.832 --> 27:48.323
You know, get stuff off your chest?

27:48.959 --> 27:50.666
Priests go to confession, too.

27:51.128 --> 27:54.292
But you only confess
to other priests, right?

27:54.840 --> 27:56.172
That's sort of how it works.

27:56.258 --> 27:58.875
Well, what if you wanted to confess
to someone else?

27:59.720 --> 28:00.676
I don't know what you mean.

28:00.762 --> 28:02.845
To me, for example.

28:03.765 --> 28:06.599
I... don't think that's a very good idea.

28:06.685 --> 28:09.177
It doesn't have to be juicy or anything.

28:09.271 --> 28:10.853
Just something real.

28:12.524 --> 28:15.688
To a normal, non-priesty person.

28:19.281 --> 28:21.068
- Might be good for you.
- I don't think that...

28:21.158 --> 28:23.115
Awesome. Switch me.

28:23.535 --> 28:25.276
Jane? Jane? Jane.

28:30.292 --> 28:31.123
What is this?

28:31.210 --> 28:32.121
It's a gift.

28:32.252 --> 28:33.163
Me to you.

28:33.962 --> 28:34.998
I don't understand.

28:35.088 --> 28:36.295
You go in there, you know,

28:36.965 --> 28:37.796
on the sinner side,

28:37.883 --> 28:40.250
and just for a few minutes
you get to be a normal person,

28:40.344 --> 28:42.427
not somebody
who's gotta do everything right.

28:42.512 --> 28:46.256
not somebody who's supposed to have
any sort of profound existential insights,

28:46.350 --> 28:48.933
and certainly not someone
who's gotta listen to me ramble on

28:49.019 --> 28:49.930
about my...

28:50.771 --> 28:51.761
dying stuff.

28:52.314 --> 28:53.225
Just be you...

28:54.858 --> 28:55.769
Daniel...

28:58.403 --> 28:59.814
with all your Daniel junk.

29:01.865 --> 29:02.776
Come on.

29:04.534 --> 29:05.445
Let's go.

29:40.529 --> 29:41.440
Hmm.

29:43.699 --> 29:48.034
Was kind of hoping that you guys
would have the upgraded side.

29:49.663 --> 29:51.780
Maybe a Tempur-Pedic chair...

29:53.333 --> 29:54.449
flat-screen.

29:55.335 --> 29:57.452
Would it kill you to get
some reading material in here?

29:57.546 --> 29:59.458
- This was a mistake.
- No, it isn't.

30:01.049 --> 30:01.960
Relax.

30:03.552 --> 30:04.463
Relax.

30:06.471 --> 30:08.258
You don't look relaxed. Relax. Breathe.

30:11.643 --> 30:12.633
Good job.

30:13.520 --> 30:14.431
So?

30:16.732 --> 30:17.643
So?

30:19.901 --> 30:20.857
You're gonna make me explain

30:20.944 --> 30:21.809
- this process to you?
- No, I just...

30:21.903 --> 30:22.939
I don't...

30:26.616 --> 30:28.403
- Now, Daniel.
- Hmm.

30:29.494 --> 30:31.360
- My child.
- Mm-hmm.

30:31.455 --> 30:32.445
My lamb.

30:33.457 --> 30:34.573
My lambchop child.

30:37.377 --> 30:38.458
Unburden yourself.

30:40.797 --> 30:41.708
Get absolved.

30:43.925 --> 30:44.836
Speak.

30:45.844 --> 30:46.834
Whatever you want to say.

31:03.320 --> 31:04.231
I don't see.

31:05.447 --> 31:06.733
You don't see?

31:09.576 --> 31:10.487
No.

31:11.870 --> 31:13.987
You don't see what?

31:20.295 --> 31:21.206
God.

31:23.757 --> 31:25.589
God... what?

31:33.809 --> 31:35.516
I don't see God.

31:44.528 --> 31:46.064
I don't think I ever have.

31:54.996 --> 31:56.032
My, uh...

32:01.545 --> 32:02.752
My dad died...

32:04.714 --> 32:06.205
last year, and, uh...

32:09.636 --> 32:12.754
he always liked the idea
of having a priest as a son.

32:13.974 --> 32:16.011
I mean, I liked the idea, too.
Don't get me wrong.

32:16.101 --> 32:18.138
It wasn't like he forced me
into it or anything.

32:18.228 --> 32:19.139
It was just...

32:21.815 --> 32:22.931
just made sense.

32:24.151 --> 32:25.062
You know?

32:27.529 --> 32:29.065
Some kids want to grow up and...

32:29.948 --> 32:32.281
pitch game seven at Yankee Stadium...

32:33.285 --> 32:34.617
give an Oscar speech...

32:35.328 --> 32:38.116
fight fires or terrorists or...

32:39.082 --> 32:39.993
whatever.

32:40.542 --> 32:43.285
I wanted to wear the fancy robes
on Sundays...

32:45.130 --> 32:47.998
give homilies
to captive audiences every week.

32:55.265 --> 32:57.257
Help people.

33:13.867 --> 33:15.654
He never missed a single mass.

33:18.622 --> 33:19.783
Even when he got sick.

33:29.591 --> 33:31.378
He used to tell people that...

33:33.303 --> 33:35.340
he wasn't afraid of death because...

33:38.266 --> 33:40.223
my Danny's got it in with the Big Guy.

33:46.816 --> 33:48.853
Truth is he was never worried though.

33:51.154 --> 33:52.395
He saw Him every day.

33:55.492 --> 33:56.403
But you don't.

33:57.035 --> 33:57.946
No.

34:00.622 --> 34:02.033
So why do you do this?

34:10.422 --> 34:13.916
Because if God ever does show up, I...

34:17.304 --> 34:18.261
I don't want to miss it.

34:31.235 --> 34:34.195
I was sort of hoping for impure thoughts
about the organ lady.

34:34.281 --> 34:35.897
Um...

34:35.991 --> 34:36.902
but...

34:37.909 --> 34:38.820
this'll do.

34:43.665 --> 34:44.576
So what now?

34:47.627 --> 34:49.083
Uh, well...

34:49.963 --> 34:51.670
I guess you could give me a penance.

34:51.755 --> 34:52.667
- Really?
- Yeah.

34:53.507 --> 34:54.543
Nice.

34:55.260 --> 34:56.341
Um...

34:57.596 --> 34:58.962
five Hail Marys,

35:00.181 --> 35:02.844
three Our Fathers...

35:04.394 --> 35:05.475
two...

35:08.690 --> 35:10.556
20 pushups.

35:10.650 --> 35:13.734
And you have to come
to my show next weekend.

35:14.154 --> 35:14.985
Show?

35:15.071 --> 35:17.404
I'm huge in this town.

35:18.325 --> 35:20.658
I'm surprised you're not already
familiar with my music,

35:20.744 --> 35:22.701
but I guess this'll give you a chance

35:22.787 --> 35:25.325
to get hip to what the kids
are into these days.

35:25.415 --> 35:27.372
- Um, I don't...
- Oh, you're totally coming.

35:27.459 --> 35:29.200
I'll save you a seat up front.

35:29.294 --> 35:32.082
I can comp you, but you gotta buy
some coffee or something,

35:32.172 --> 35:33.538
or the owner's gonna get pissy.

35:33.632 --> 35:35.248
- Okay?
- I really don't think this...

35:35.342 --> 35:39.586
Great. I'll give you the details
at our next confession slash date.

35:39.679 --> 35:42.046
Jane. Jane.

35:42.557 --> 35:43.513
Jane!

35:43.600 --> 35:46.308
Yes, you can buy merch from me
directly after the show.

35:46.394 --> 35:48.135
- Jane, I...
- Autographs are fine,

35:48.229 --> 35:50.266
but, please, no photos.

36:16.633 --> 36:17.965
Miss your run again?

36:22.889 --> 36:23.800
Want a muffin?

36:24.683 --> 36:25.639
They're minis, so...

36:26.309 --> 36:28.301
you can have, like, 30 of them,
and they're still not that bad for you.

36:33.274 --> 36:34.435
Why do you do this?

36:40.365 --> 36:41.981
I'm addicted to refined sugar.

36:42.075 --> 36:44.533
It just tastes so darn good on everything,

36:44.619 --> 36:47.111
and if that's a sin, I just figure
I'll work it out on the other side,

36:47.205 --> 36:48.616
but Adam had his apple, and I...

36:50.041 --> 36:51.202
truth be told,

36:51.292 --> 36:54.160
I'm just looking
for one guilt-free sleeve of Oreos,

36:54.254 --> 36:55.711
and I don't think that's too much to ask.

36:57.966 --> 36:59.707
- That's not what I meant.
- I know.

37:03.722 --> 37:04.803
So what...

37:05.390 --> 37:06.301
what's going on with you?

37:07.726 --> 37:08.716
I don't know.

37:08.810 --> 37:12.099
But you're hoping I can offer you

37:12.188 --> 37:14.646
some sort of divine nugget of wisdom

37:14.733 --> 37:17.191
that'll make all the pieces
add up together for you?

37:18.111 --> 37:19.318
What's the story?

37:19.404 --> 37:23.023
Having a crisis of faith or...
something else?

37:23.450 --> 37:24.440
I have faith.

37:27.787 --> 37:31.622
Yippee! Good for you, Father Jamieson.

37:32.167 --> 37:33.078
I just...

37:33.293 --> 37:34.204
I mean, I'm...

37:35.587 --> 37:37.078
I'm just trying to figure it out,

37:37.172 --> 37:38.162
and you...

37:40.467 --> 37:41.298
Forget it.

37:41.384 --> 37:42.374
Did you do the last rights?

37:43.136 --> 37:44.047
What?

37:47.432 --> 37:48.388
When your dad died.

37:50.685 --> 37:52.472
Were you the one
who gave him his last rights?

37:52.562 --> 37:53.518
Yes.

37:55.148 --> 37:56.434
And how did that feel?

37:59.444 --> 38:00.730
He told me it was worth it...

38:02.071 --> 38:03.027
dying...

38:04.616 --> 38:06.482
in order for me to be
the one to anoint him.

38:08.578 --> 38:09.534
What about you, though?

38:13.249 --> 38:14.205
How did you feel?

38:16.169 --> 38:17.330
Gracious?

38:17.420 --> 38:18.410
Did you feel...

38:19.547 --> 38:20.458
blessed?

38:24.719 --> 38:25.630
Just sad.

38:32.519 --> 38:33.851
Go ahead and have a seat, will ya?

38:39.150 --> 38:40.391
Go ahead and take the whole box.

38:42.946 --> 38:44.027
Yeah, they're gluten free.

38:44.948 --> 38:45.904
Organic.

38:49.410 --> 38:50.617
Mostly locally sourced.

38:53.414 --> 38:56.578
Not quite farm to table, but...

38:56.668 --> 38:59.126
...pretty good.

39:07.720 --> 39:10.053
So I've got the second Sunday mass,

39:10.139 --> 39:12.426
a baptism on Saturday afternoon,

39:12.517 --> 39:14.554
and the Monday-morning confession.

39:15.019 --> 39:16.260
Wednesday choir practice

39:16.354 --> 39:18.141
and the Saturday-evening mass.

39:18.231 --> 39:20.097
Oh, and this is pretty fun:

39:20.483 --> 39:22.975
The kids from Sunday school
have asked me to...

39:23.862 --> 39:25.103
to come in and teach a lesson.

39:26.531 --> 39:27.442
You?

39:27.907 --> 39:28.943
Yeah.

39:29.826 --> 39:30.737
It's strange.

39:30.994 --> 39:32.781
It turns out that they find some people

39:32.871 --> 39:35.955
a little more relatable than others.

39:36.040 --> 39:37.872
Well, they're only eight years old, so...

39:39.711 --> 39:41.748
And I will be spending quite a bit of time

39:41.838 --> 39:42.954
over at Ronnie's.

39:43.047 --> 39:44.254
Why not the hospital?

39:45.008 --> 39:46.499
No, that stubborn son of a bitch,

39:46.593 --> 39:47.674
he just refuses to...

39:49.137 --> 39:50.048
let go.

39:51.139 --> 39:53.973
They have moved him home.
He is strictly hospice now.

39:54.559 --> 39:55.800
He's really still alive?

39:56.811 --> 39:57.722
Well, I'll tell you what, Father.

39:58.479 --> 40:01.392
I will let him know that
his selfish need to cling to life

40:01.482 --> 40:03.439
is disrupting your schedule.
How's that sound?

40:03.902 --> 40:05.894
Hmm. How's your week looking?

40:06.613 --> 40:08.104
It's pretty much the same as the last,

40:08.197 --> 40:10.154
except for a few adjustments.

40:10.241 --> 40:11.607
Uh, n-not so fast.

40:12.327 --> 40:15.286
You'll be happy to know that I talked to
the bishop,

40:15.371 --> 40:19.081
and he agreed to drop
the Friday night confessions.

40:19.876 --> 40:23.369
I... It... I just think
that maybe we should...

40:23.463 --> 40:26.376
Well, the church
is going back to normal hours.

40:26.883 --> 40:28.499
Building will close at night.

40:29.385 --> 40:30.501
End of story.

40:31.429 --> 40:32.340
Okay?

40:32.805 --> 40:33.716
Okay.

40:42.231 --> 40:44.769
<i>No, Mom, they don't call mourning
"morning"</i>

40:44.859 --> 40:46.270
<i>because it's supposed to happen every day.</i>

40:46.361 --> 40:47.568
<i>Who told you that?</i>

40:51.699 --> 40:52.610
<i>I know.</i>

40:54.202 --> 40:55.113
<i>I know.</i>

40:57.747 --> 40:59.113
<i>But I don't let it take over.</i>

41:00.333 --> 41:01.949
<i>He wouldn't have wanted us to...</i>

41:04.379 --> 41:06.211
<i>Everything happens for a reason.</i>

41:10.510 --> 41:11.626
<i>I love you too, Mom.</i>

41:13.304 --> 41:14.215
<i>God bless.</i>

43:40.284 --> 43:41.900
One was I couldn't sing harmony,

43:41.994 --> 43:44.611
and the other problem was
I couldn't sing melody.

43:44.705 --> 43:46.241
- So...
- This is me.

43:47.708 --> 43:50.291
Oh... nice.

43:50.378 --> 43:52.370
- Nice.
- Weird, right?

43:52.463 --> 43:53.374
Hmm?

43:53.714 --> 43:55.000
I actually live somewhere.

43:56.717 --> 43:58.003
Now I'm real, too.

43:59.887 --> 44:01.128
Thanks for walking me home.

44:01.430 --> 44:03.342
I always wanted a priest as a bodyguard.

44:04.142 --> 44:05.132
You don't really strike me

44:05.226 --> 44:07.183
as the type of person
that needs protection.

44:07.270 --> 44:08.431
We all need it, Daniel.

44:09.355 --> 44:11.096
The world kinda sucks.

44:11.440 --> 44:12.271
You don't believe that.

44:12.358 --> 44:13.189
No, you don't,

44:13.276 --> 44:14.266
which is why I like you,

44:14.360 --> 44:16.101
but you're also, you know...

44:17.155 --> 44:18.066
you.

44:19.949 --> 44:21.861
Again, confirming my world view.

44:21.951 --> 44:23.067
What's that supposed to mean?

44:23.494 --> 44:24.530
Oh, nothing.

44:24.996 --> 44:27.909
Nothing here. Just a lovely friendship.

44:27.999 --> 44:28.989
What's wrong with that?

44:29.083 --> 44:32.326
Nothing. You're a priest. I'm dying.

44:33.421 --> 44:34.332
I get it,

44:34.589 --> 44:36.706
but in different circumstances,

44:36.799 --> 44:38.210
we're totally dating right now.

44:38.301 --> 44:39.587
No. No, I...

44:41.095 --> 44:43.212
- No.
- Wow, Father,

44:43.681 --> 44:45.673
you really know
how to make a girl feel special.

44:45.766 --> 44:47.428
No, I mean...

44:47.518 --> 44:48.850
this isn't...

44:48.936 --> 44:50.802
I- I... We're...

44:50.897 --> 44:52.229
I... I wouldn't say that...

44:52.315 --> 44:53.726
that... I mean, we're not.

44:53.816 --> 44:55.557
I- I'm not. You know?

44:55.818 --> 44:57.059
No, I don't,

44:57.153 --> 44:59.065
but I'd be happy to give feedback

44:59.155 --> 45:01.317
if you feel compelled to articulate

45:01.407 --> 45:02.648
an entire thought.

45:10.124 --> 45:12.207
I am committed to God.

45:14.086 --> 45:15.873
That means that any...

45:17.131 --> 45:20.215
emotional connection,

45:20.760 --> 45:21.841
that is...

45:21.928 --> 45:23.965
other than friendship,

45:24.055 --> 45:26.172
which... which is
what I think that we have...

45:26.265 --> 45:27.176
friendship.

45:27.642 --> 45:29.133
You know? A really strong...

45:30.311 --> 45:32.849
But anything more than that

45:32.939 --> 45:35.977
is obviously not allowed.

45:36.067 --> 45:37.729
I mean, it goes against everything...

45:37.818 --> 45:39.605
uh... everything...

45:42.198 --> 45:43.564
that I am, so...

45:46.244 --> 45:48.782
How do you expect to get laid
if you keep saying that kind of stuff?

45:52.458 --> 45:54.074
That was a joke. Relax.

45:57.129 --> 46:00.167
Well, you're probably going
to hell because of it,

46:00.258 --> 46:01.965
so I really hope it was worth it.

46:07.556 --> 46:09.218
I really can't tell jokes, can I?

46:12.019 --> 46:12.930
Come on.

46:13.938 --> 46:14.928
No, man, sorry.

46:17.483 --> 46:20.817
But you did really sell the whole
humorless, stodgy priest thing

46:20.903 --> 46:21.768
- Yeah.
- ...there.

46:21.862 --> 46:24.570
We work on it in seminary, for years.

46:25.449 --> 46:26.815
Yeah, that and thurible swinging.

46:27.702 --> 46:29.238
- Thurible swinging?
- Yeah.

46:30.663 --> 46:31.744
Sounds dirty.

46:33.624 --> 46:34.785
Uh, well...

46:35.751 --> 46:37.788
Sorry. It's late.

46:37.878 --> 46:38.789
You're cute.

46:39.964 --> 46:40.920
I'm human.

46:41.674 --> 46:44.382
Can I... ask you a question?

46:44.468 --> 46:45.379
Maybe.

46:47.763 --> 46:48.594
The whole dying thing.

46:48.681 --> 46:50.217
- No.
- What?

46:50.308 --> 46:51.640
- Let's not.
- Come on.

46:52.268 --> 46:54.806
You've got off-limits, you know, stuff.
So do I.

46:54.895 --> 46:57.387
- Well, we both know that you're not...
- Daniel.

46:57.481 --> 46:58.938
I mean, you don't even look sick.

46:59.942 --> 47:00.932
Like at all.

47:03.738 --> 47:05.445
It's late. I should go inside.

47:05.531 --> 47:06.521
Jane.

47:07.742 --> 47:08.903
Thanks for walking me home.

47:09.869 --> 47:11.451
I didn't mean to...

47:12.371 --> 47:13.282
It's just...

47:15.249 --> 47:19.209
I don't know why we have to keep up
with the, you know, charade.

47:19.295 --> 47:20.251
Charade?

47:20.838 --> 47:21.954
No, that's not what I...

47:22.173 --> 47:23.129
I- I just mean...

47:23.841 --> 47:25.673
you don't...

47:26.344 --> 47:27.880
- I mean, you look...
- How?

47:28.471 --> 47:29.382
What?

47:32.850 --> 47:33.761
How do I look?

47:35.561 --> 47:37.769
Well, no, I just...

47:40.441 --> 47:41.682
I don't look frail...

47:43.694 --> 47:44.605
helpless?

47:51.160 --> 47:52.742
I seem a bit too healthy?

47:54.538 --> 47:59.875
Well, I guess that's a testament
to my formidable spirit.

48:03.589 --> 48:06.423
Good night, friend.

48:48.634 --> 48:50.546
There's a decent case for blasphemy
here...

49:02.648 --> 49:06.983
You see? Keep missing your morning jogs,

49:07.069 --> 49:08.651
breaking your routine,

49:09.572 --> 49:10.653
that's your future.

49:17.621 --> 49:18.532
What?

49:19.331 --> 49:20.242
Nothing.

49:21.584 --> 49:22.574
Daniel, say it.

49:22.668 --> 49:23.658
He's happy.

49:24.336 --> 49:25.247
What?

49:25.421 --> 49:29.290
I know that you take some issue
with Father Ollie's eccentricities, but...

49:30.801 --> 49:32.133
He treats this like a joke.

49:33.053 --> 49:33.964
But look at him.

49:56.619 --> 49:57.905
That's what I'm talking about.

49:58.496 --> 50:00.078
Good, good, good, good, good.

50:00.331 --> 50:02.448
Lost your snare at the bridge, Keyshawn...

50:02.541 --> 50:04.954
He's wearing basketball shoes.

50:05.461 --> 50:06.451
under his habit.

50:06.545 --> 50:07.877
You know what I mean.

50:07.963 --> 50:10.205
I'm not so sure... actually.

50:12.968 --> 50:13.879
Never mind.

50:14.303 --> 50:15.293
Doug?

50:17.640 --> 50:18.721
Were you lip syncing?

50:19.725 --> 50:21.091
- No.
- Doug.

50:22.269 --> 50:23.350
- No.
- Doug.

50:27.483 --> 50:28.519
And I broke Doug.

50:29.318 --> 50:30.274
That's on me.

50:30.861 --> 50:31.772
That's my bad.

50:33.489 --> 50:35.401
- Daniel...
- I should probably go get some work done.

50:35.824 --> 50:36.735
- Doug, come.
- Sit.

50:37.952 --> 50:38.783
Come here. Come here.

50:38.869 --> 50:40.826
Come here. C'mere, c'mere, c'mere...

50:40.913 --> 50:43.121
Doug, sing these...

50:48.212 --> 50:49.293
Bring your air down lower.

50:56.303 --> 50:59.171
And you're back. I'm so proud of you.

50:59.265 --> 51:01.348
- That's the way to...
- What's going on here?

51:03.143 --> 51:04.054
What is it?

51:04.436 --> 51:05.347
I met someone.

51:06.063 --> 51:07.179
You met someone?

51:07.898 --> 51:08.809
Yes.

51:11.485 --> 51:12.441
What does that mean?

51:13.153 --> 51:14.109
A person.

51:14.488 --> 51:16.650
I met a person.
There was a person, and I met her.

51:17.992 --> 51:18.903
Her?

51:19.660 --> 51:20.571
Yes.

51:23.497 --> 51:24.408
Hmm.

51:25.624 --> 51:26.535
I see.

51:27.876 --> 51:28.866
No big deal.

51:28.961 --> 51:30.668
And that's what happens

51:30.754 --> 51:32.620
when you apply
a little bit of enthusiasm...

51:35.718 --> 51:36.708
Doug!

51:38.220 --> 51:39.961
Now you're embarrassing yourself

51:40.514 --> 51:41.755
in a place of worship.

51:42.391 --> 51:43.302
Take a knee.

51:44.268 --> 51:46.305
You will not be in this rehearsal
until I tell you.

51:47.104 --> 51:50.268
So it wasn't just someone you met.

51:50.357 --> 51:52.895
You... You met her.

51:53.861 --> 51:56.478
A... female someone.

51:57.156 --> 51:58.397
I didn't do anything, Father.

51:59.241 --> 52:00.072
No one says you did.

52:00.159 --> 52:01.991
- Because I didn't.
- Okay.

52:02.077 --> 52:04.820
So it doesn't matter
if it was a female someone or a her

52:04.913 --> 52:06.825
if I didn't do anything,
which I didn't, so it doesn't...

52:07.583 --> 52:08.494
matter.

52:09.084 --> 52:10.416
- Great.
- Terrific.

52:11.378 --> 52:12.289
Glory be.

52:23.849 --> 52:25.306
I didn't do anything, Father.

52:28.312 --> 52:32.022
Well, that's between you and God,
now, isn't it?

52:32.316 --> 52:33.807
Let's go one more time. Let's feel it.

52:34.151 --> 52:35.938
Practice makes perfect.

53:09.311 --> 53:10.677
B-4.

53:14.066 --> 53:16.228
Bingo Thursdays with Edith and Ruth.

53:17.611 --> 53:18.567
And Jane.

53:18.654 --> 53:20.020
G-51.

53:20.614 --> 53:21.946
Oh! G-51.

53:26.537 --> 53:28.244
When you're blessed, you're blessed.
Am I right?

53:30.207 --> 53:31.118
Yeah?

53:32.209 --> 53:33.120
No?

53:35.421 --> 53:36.411
Okay.

53:36.797 --> 53:38.254
<i>I-17.</i>

53:41.719 --> 53:43.836
Nope. No I-17.

53:44.638 --> 53:45.549
I-16.

53:45.889 --> 53:47.596
I-18 would've done it. But no.

53:52.146 --> 53:53.057
This is fun.

53:53.480 --> 53:55.096
Let me know when you really wanna talk.

53:57.651 --> 53:58.607
Jane.

53:59.027 --> 53:59.938
<i>E-7.</i>

54:03.115 --> 54:04.105
I got you something.

54:05.868 --> 54:07.825
- What is it?
- Open it.

54:08.662 --> 54:10.073
I wasn't expecting you'd...

54:12.040 --> 54:13.156
You've been holding out on me.

54:14.710 --> 54:16.918
I don't know what to say.

54:18.756 --> 54:22.466
I'm pleasantly... Surprised.

54:25.095 --> 54:26.176
Is this a joke?

54:26.555 --> 54:29.172
- What do you mean?
- I don't understand.

54:30.768 --> 54:32.009
<i>E-46.</i>

54:35.814 --> 54:37.100
Don't do this Daniel.

54:37.816 --> 54:38.727
Please.

54:39.359 --> 54:42.648
You of all people. I'm not letting you
turn out to be a disappointment too.

54:44.865 --> 54:46.072
<i>O-68.</i>

54:48.744 --> 54:51.487
Please, just... take that.

54:51.997 --> 54:52.908
For your sake.

54:55.751 --> 54:56.662
For my sake?

54:57.753 --> 54:58.664
See you around.

54:59.129 --> 55:00.040
Father.

55:03.175 --> 55:04.837
<i>I-43.</i>

55:06.470 --> 55:07.506
Where are we?

55:10.682 --> 55:11.593
Why are we here?

55:12.142 --> 55:13.349
No, no no, don't.

55:13.936 --> 55:17.179
Don't try to answer. Just maybe give that
some thought for a second or two.

55:20.192 --> 55:21.182
Why are we here?

55:21.985 --> 55:23.601
I mean, I can tell you for a fact

55:23.695 --> 55:26.403
I'm only here
for the free communion wafers.

55:26.490 --> 55:28.231
Course that's just me.
But the rest of you.

55:29.701 --> 55:30.612
Why?

55:32.204 --> 55:36.289
And I, I don't mean philosophically.

55:37.209 --> 55:40.293
I mean right now. In this exact moment.

55:41.255 --> 55:43.463
What brought you into this building?

55:44.424 --> 55:45.335
Guilt?

55:45.884 --> 55:46.795
Fear?

55:47.553 --> 55:52.093
Obligation? Perhaps you aren't even
into the big radio hits.

55:52.182 --> 55:54.925
And you're more of a deep track,
B- side kind of guy.

55:55.018 --> 55:59.012
So, are you looking for
a sense of community?

56:00.357 --> 56:01.893
A moment of reflection?

56:03.861 --> 56:04.897
An escape?

56:07.531 --> 56:08.863
You can do a lot worse.

56:10.617 --> 56:13.530
This really is a beautiful building.

56:14.788 --> 56:16.450
Oh my goodness.

56:18.125 --> 56:19.036
But...

56:19.585 --> 56:20.496
But...

56:21.545 --> 56:23.002
If what brought you here

56:23.672 --> 56:28.337
doesn't at least have something to do
with compassion,

56:30.470 --> 56:32.052
Well then, that's all there really is.

56:32.139 --> 56:33.050
Huh?

56:34.683 --> 56:35.594
A building.

56:38.770 --> 56:39.681
Compassion.

56:40.522 --> 56:41.603
Oh, what a concept.

56:42.482 --> 56:45.145
I mean, we all like to think
that we are...

56:45.611 --> 56:46.818
Compassionate.

56:47.154 --> 56:48.270
Hope you feel better.

56:48.906 --> 56:51.569
Thoughts and prayers.
I'm so very sorry for your loss.

56:54.494 --> 56:56.577
But it's a funny thing though.

56:58.457 --> 57:02.451
Because when you find out where the word
compassion comes from, it's real...

57:03.128 --> 57:04.118
origin.

57:04.963 --> 57:06.955
It turns out the word actually means

57:09.426 --> 57:10.667
to suffer with.

57:11.303 --> 57:18.301
Not to pity. Not to feel sorry for not
to send hugs to somebody's Facebook wall.

57:20.562 --> 57:21.848
But to suffer with.

57:25.067 --> 57:26.433
And are you capable

57:26.818 --> 57:28.059
of suffering with

57:29.571 --> 57:30.482
someone else?

57:31.782 --> 57:32.818
To...

57:35.327 --> 57:36.693
take on their pain.

57:38.789 --> 57:40.826
And carry it around with you for a while.

57:43.710 --> 57:44.666
Someone

57:48.131 --> 57:49.042
hurting.

57:50.467 --> 57:51.378
Someone

57:55.097 --> 57:56.178
completely lost.

57:57.891 --> 57:58.802
Someone

58:00.811 --> 58:02.177
with less than you.

58:02.562 --> 58:03.473
Less

58:04.064 --> 58:07.523
money. Less stuff. Yeah, whatever.
But what about less freedom?

58:09.903 --> 58:10.893
Less choice.

58:10.988 --> 58:11.899
Less...

58:13.156 --> 58:14.067
privilege.

58:16.493 --> 58:18.029
Less basic human rights.

58:23.291 --> 58:25.248
Are you truly able to suffer with,

58:28.380 --> 58:29.291
others?

58:32.384 --> 58:33.340
But,

58:36.263 --> 58:37.174
will you?

58:43.687 --> 58:44.677
How much I owe you?

58:53.113 --> 58:55.526
Good run? Good, yeah. Very good.

58:56.199 --> 58:57.110
Very focused.

58:57.826 --> 58:58.737
Good.

58:59.161 --> 59:00.447
It was great, actually.

59:00.537 --> 59:01.448
It was,

59:01.747 --> 59:02.658
Great.

59:02.956 --> 59:03.867
Great.

59:04.207 --> 59:06.073
I would definitely classify that run
as great.

59:06.460 --> 59:08.747
If I were to classify it.
Which apparently I am. So...

59:09.713 --> 59:13.252
Yep. I could file it under G for great.

59:18.847 --> 59:19.758
How's scripture?

59:20.140 --> 59:21.051
Wonderful.

59:21.349 --> 59:22.260
It is.

59:23.101 --> 59:24.637
Always wonderful. Scripture.

59:30.817 --> 59:33.651
I'm just going to go ahead
and opt out of this conversation.

59:43.705 --> 59:44.866
How's it going?

59:47.876 --> 59:48.912
'Kay, I'm on my way.

59:50.087 --> 59:51.077
Everything okay?

59:51.421 --> 59:53.128
It's Ronnie. He's on his way out.

59:53.215 --> 59:54.706
Well, perhaps you should allow
the family to...

59:54.800 --> 59:55.711
He asked for me.

59:56.009 --> 59:58.797
- Oh. You've spent so much time...
- He asked for me, Victor.

01:00:02.432 --> 01:00:03.343
Of course.

01:00:04.059 --> 01:00:06.927
If one of you could cover
my 10:00am confession, that'd be ter...

01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:08.602
- Can I go with you?
- No.

01:00:09.314 --> 01:00:11.601
- What if, uh
- We'll finish in the car.

01:01:52.876 --> 01:01:54.117
So, dying sucks.

01:01:57.297 --> 01:01:58.208
You okay?

01:01:59.299 --> 01:02:01.586
Yeah. I didn't really know him, so...

01:02:01.885 --> 01:02:03.046
Well, that's not what I asked.

01:02:05.889 --> 01:02:07.005
I'm fine.

01:02:11.728 --> 01:02:13.219
It's awfully easy to forget, but,

01:02:16.233 --> 01:02:19.476
we're pretty damn lucky to be able to do
what we do.

01:02:21.363 --> 01:02:22.274
Priests?

01:02:25.283 --> 01:02:26.194
Humans.

01:02:30.830 --> 01:02:34.323
What do you say? Wanna crush
a little Arby's on the way home?

01:02:44.803 --> 01:02:45.714
Thank you.

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:49.548
You know, it's fans like you that really
make it all worth-while.

01:02:51.393 --> 01:02:54.761
You see, that was actually funny because
you guys aren't being supportive.

01:02:55.188 --> 01:02:56.099
At all.

01:02:56.314 --> 01:02:57.270
Is why it's funny.

01:02:57.983 --> 01:02:58.939
What I just said.

01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:03.231
Okay.

01:03:10.203 --> 01:03:11.114
I cheered.

01:03:11.955 --> 01:03:14.163
Probably couldn't hear me because
I was standing outside the door.

01:03:14.249 --> 01:03:15.160
What do you want?

01:03:15.959 --> 01:03:16.995
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

01:03:17.544 --> 01:03:19.251
For the other day and the bible.

01:03:19.713 --> 01:03:20.703
Just say being a dick.

01:03:21.256 --> 01:03:22.963
- What?
- I'm sorry for being a dick.

01:03:23.508 --> 01:03:24.589
That should cover everything.

01:03:27.512 --> 01:03:30.050
- I'm sorry for...
- Yes Daniel, you can take me home.

01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:31.472
But please no funny business.

01:03:31.808 --> 01:03:33.800
I'm saving myself for the right clergyman.

01:03:43.028 --> 01:03:44.018
You want something to drink?

01:03:44.946 --> 01:03:45.857
Uh, yeah.

01:03:46.573 --> 01:03:48.530
I have...

01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:52.068
Water. And... Water.

01:03:53.246 --> 01:03:54.157
And...

01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:55.951
Well, water.

01:03:57.292 --> 01:03:58.783
Water would be great.

01:03:59.544 --> 01:04:00.455
Great.

01:04:01.838 --> 01:04:03.124
Make yourself at home.

01:04:35.205 --> 01:04:36.821
It's amazing. Isn't it?

01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:41.746
Jane.

01:04:42.087 --> 01:04:43.123
- No.
- What?

01:04:43.755 --> 01:04:45.963
You said Jane like, Jane.

01:04:46.049 --> 01:04:46.960
What does that mean?

01:04:47.509 --> 01:04:49.045
- That tone.
- I had a tone?

01:04:49.135 --> 01:04:50.592
Um, yeah. That, you know...

01:04:51.304 --> 01:04:53.045
- That, eat your vegetables tone.
- Jane.

01:04:54.015 --> 01:04:54.926
Don't do it.

01:04:55.225 --> 01:04:56.341
- I, can we just...
- Don't.

01:04:56.434 --> 01:04:58.141
- I just wanna ask...
- We had a good thing.

01:04:58.895 --> 01:04:59.931
Why would you wanna mess that...

01:05:00.021 --> 01:05:01.637
Do you even know
what it is that I'm gonna ask?

01:05:02.273 --> 01:05:03.184
- Yeah.
- Really.

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:04.766
- Yeah.
- So?

01:05:04.859 --> 01:05:05.815
So, what?

01:05:06.444 --> 01:05:07.400
Eh-tell me.

01:05:07.654 --> 01:05:10.988
Why would I say something out loud that
I'm practically begging you not to ask?

01:05:11.074 --> 01:05:13.361
Because you realize that I'm asking you
a real question.

01:05:13.660 --> 01:05:16.118
You Miss, uh, I-Sing.

01:05:17.205 --> 01:05:19.538
And-I'm-Emotionally-Fearless.

01:05:20.125 --> 01:05:21.741
And-I-Do-Really-Weird-Things-To-My-Hair.

01:05:22.043 --> 01:05:24.581
To-Try-And-Make-It-Less-Attractive-
But-It-Always-Makes-It-More-Attractive.

01:05:29.759 --> 01:05:32.843
You're afraid to let somebody know
who you are.

01:05:38.268 --> 01:05:40.180
- You think this makes me more attractive?
- Okay.

01:05:48.695 --> 01:05:51.733
You were going to ask me
about the whole death thing. Again.

01:05:55.201 --> 01:05:56.191
I told you I knew.

01:05:59.706 --> 01:06:00.822
Do you get that a lot?

01:06:01.499 --> 01:06:02.410
Yeah.

01:06:04.878 --> 01:06:06.619
Right before I never see someone again.

01:06:17.056 --> 01:06:18.046
I'm not going anywhere.

01:06:18.391 --> 01:06:19.347
Yeah well...

01:06:19.976 --> 01:06:21.342
You're not the one I'm worried about.

01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:26.430
I'm not crazy.

01:06:27.150 --> 01:06:28.357
In case you were wondering.

01:06:30.778 --> 01:06:33.020
I mean, yeah. But no.

01:06:33.656 --> 01:06:34.567
Not really.

01:06:46.461 --> 01:06:47.702
It started off as a joke.

01:06:48.963 --> 01:06:50.625
But just, saying it,

01:06:51.382 --> 01:06:52.372
I'm dying.

01:06:52.926 --> 01:06:53.837
Finite.

01:06:55.011 --> 01:06:56.798
It gave things a sense of urgency.

01:06:59.807 --> 01:07:01.423
And sometimes it doesn't work.

01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:04.142
Well, most of the time.

01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:08.271
But there are days,

01:07:09.150 --> 01:07:11.107
if I really let myself buy into it,

01:07:12.278 --> 01:07:16.192
where I can actually see the beauty
of how little time we actually have.

01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:21.781
And lately,

01:07:23.331 --> 01:07:25.573
that only seems to be happening
when I'm with you.

01:07:56.614 --> 01:07:57.980
What the hell are we?

01:08:00.493 --> 01:08:01.404
I don't know.

01:08:04.622 --> 01:08:05.578
I think that's okay.

01:08:07.292 --> 01:08:08.203
Me too.

01:08:09.294 --> 01:08:10.910
But we should make some rules.

01:08:11.337 --> 01:08:13.124
- Rules?
- Yeah.

01:08:13.423 --> 01:08:17.258
If we're gonna proceed with this whole,
star-crossed, platonic,

01:08:17.551 --> 01:08:19.544
G- rated, tragicomedy

01:08:20.345 --> 01:08:21.336
of ours,

01:08:21.889 --> 01:08:25.256
we should be very clear on what we can
and can't do.

01:08:25.350 --> 01:08:26.432
That's actually not a bad idea.

01:08:26.519 --> 01:08:29.307
Which makes sense,
'cause I only have good ones. So... What?

01:08:29.856 --> 01:08:30.812
Rule number one:

01:08:31.858 --> 01:08:33.895
- Nothing sexual and...
- Yep. Agreed.

01:08:33.984 --> 01:08:36.318
- I wasn't finished.
- I am sorry.

01:08:37.196 --> 01:08:38.778
Nothing sexual in nature.

01:08:39.657 --> 01:08:44.903
Although, I mean.
I can't just turn off my natural appeal.

01:08:45.121 --> 01:08:46.032
I mean...

01:08:46.538 --> 01:08:47.529
There's a lot going on here.

01:08:47.624 --> 01:08:49.911
And you're just gonna have to learn
to view it as a work of art

01:08:50.001 --> 01:08:53.118
in a museum that you can view
and appreciate but you know never...

01:08:53.212 --> 01:08:55.420
And you, quite frankly... I'm sorry.

01:08:55.506 --> 01:08:58.214
Are gonna have to stop dressing
so suggestively.

01:08:58.301 --> 01:08:59.212
I know.

01:09:00.636 --> 01:09:02.970
- Rule number two...
- Uh-uh my turn.

01:09:03.055 --> 01:09:05.890
- But I...
- I get to make some rules.

01:09:05.975 --> 01:09:07.432
Okay, but mine was gonna be good.

01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:10.932
Rule number two:

01:09:12.732 --> 01:09:16.270
we let ourselves be friends.

01:09:18.529 --> 01:09:19.609
Without shame.

01:10:26.848 --> 01:10:28.134
<i>Could be a bit tight.</i>

01:10:28.933 --> 01:10:32.973
But for having three baptisms in a week,
I think we found a really nice job.

01:10:33.062 --> 01:10:34.018
What about Friday?

01:10:34.397 --> 01:10:35.308
Friday?

01:10:35.565 --> 01:10:36.681
Yeah. Night.

01:10:37.442 --> 01:10:40.776
If I have this correct I think we should
all be free at that time.

01:10:41.654 --> 01:10:43.145
- For what?
- Dinner.

01:10:43.823 --> 01:10:48.534
No offense, but we already eat together
like 15 times a week.

01:10:49.871 --> 01:10:53.740
I also have a reservation for the Golden
Corral, which I'm not gonna miss.

01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:55.286
They take reservations?

01:10:56.502 --> 01:10:58.835
No. No Daniel, they don't.

01:11:00.131 --> 01:11:01.167
What's going on Friday?

01:11:01.883 --> 01:11:04.842
I just thought that we could all have
dinner. Together. At the rectory.

01:11:04.927 --> 01:11:07.044
- Oh yeah, no problem.
- With a friend of mine.

01:11:09.515 --> 01:11:10.426
A friend?

01:11:11.642 --> 01:11:14.726
If this friend is as fun as you two,

01:11:15.813 --> 01:11:16.724
well, count me in.

01:11:16.814 --> 01:11:18.931
She is fun. Great.

01:11:19.692 --> 01:11:20.603
Fun and great.

01:11:22.612 --> 01:11:23.523
She?

01:11:24.947 --> 01:11:26.108
She. Yes.

01:11:26.365 --> 01:11:29.699
She's a she. Jane is her name.
It's a female name.

01:11:30.077 --> 01:11:33.115
Which she has because she's a girl. Woman.

01:11:36.501 --> 01:11:38.493
Well, to be clear,

01:11:40.963 --> 01:11:43.706
I'm definitely available
for this dinner now.

01:12:10.493 --> 01:12:11.483
I like the bread.

01:12:12.578 --> 01:12:14.365
- Thanks.
- Yes, Daniel.

01:12:15.289 --> 01:12:16.245
Bread is quite good.

01:12:16.833 --> 01:12:17.744
It's brioche.

01:12:17.875 --> 01:12:19.082
I didn't realize you baked.

01:12:19.377 --> 01:12:21.164
Oh no. I bought it.

01:12:21.379 --> 01:12:22.586
Well, it's really good.

01:12:23.047 --> 01:12:23.958
Still.

01:12:24.048 --> 01:12:26.791
For store bought it's really good.

01:12:27.343 --> 01:12:28.424
Pasta's good too.

01:12:29.512 --> 01:12:31.424
You bought the pasta as well?

01:12:31.514 --> 01:12:33.426
Nope. Nope. I made that, myself.

01:12:33.975 --> 01:12:36.388
- Old family recipe.
- Oh.

01:12:37.603 --> 01:12:38.514
Ollie.

01:12:39.522 --> 01:12:44.859
You being a connoisseur of all things,
remotely edible,

01:12:45.653 --> 01:12:49.021
I'd love to have your expert opinion
on the meal.

01:12:50.658 --> 01:12:52.194
- It's hilarious.
- I'm sorry?

01:12:54.245 --> 01:12:57.909
Very good. It's delicious.
Excellent effort. I'm proud of you.

01:12:57.999 --> 01:12:58.864
Thank you.

01:12:58.958 --> 01:13:00.995
I always felt like I should cook more,
you know?

01:13:01.210 --> 01:13:03.293
I agree. And the best part
of cooking more,

01:13:05.631 --> 01:13:06.712
is more dinner guests.

01:13:07.341 --> 01:13:09.674
Umm... Thanks.

01:13:10.177 --> 01:13:11.293
No. Thank you.

01:13:13.180 --> 01:13:16.799
And thank you for introducing us to Jenny.

01:13:17.894 --> 01:13:18.805
Jane.

01:13:19.645 --> 01:13:20.726
What did I say?

01:13:21.564 --> 01:13:22.520
Not Jane.

01:13:24.442 --> 01:13:28.527
Strawberry shortcake for dessert.
So, you know, gotta save room.

01:13:30.990 --> 01:13:33.232
- And ice cream.
- Sponge or pound?

01:13:33.492 --> 01:13:34.403
What?

01:13:35.411 --> 01:13:37.949
Sponge cake or pound cake as the base?

01:13:38.247 --> 01:13:40.239
You know,
it's called strawberry short cake,

01:13:40.333 --> 01:13:42.996
but I never really considered
strawberry shortcake

01:13:43.085 --> 01:13:46.203
unless it has a pound cake
or a sponge cake as the base.

01:13:46.672 --> 01:13:48.379
Not that biscuit thing

01:13:48.466 --> 01:13:51.209
that my grandmother used to always
try to pass off as dessert.

01:13:52.511 --> 01:13:54.173
Well, traditionally speaking,

01:13:54.597 --> 01:14:00.264
shortcake is really supposed to be
more savory, less sweet.

01:14:01.646 --> 01:14:06.391
A fun fact. Especially if you decide
you want to do your own baking.

01:14:07.151 --> 01:14:08.938
I definitely prefer sponge cake.

01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:10.231
Oh.

01:14:10.488 --> 01:14:11.899
That's your God given right.

01:14:12.698 --> 01:14:13.905
And there is um...

01:14:14.367 --> 01:14:16.859
certainly others who feel that it's

01:14:17.495 --> 01:14:21.455
less, uh, substantive. Empty.

01:14:22.249 --> 01:14:23.160
Fleeting.

01:14:23.668 --> 01:14:25.000
But it tastes better.

01:14:25.503 --> 01:14:26.493
Amen, sister.

01:14:27.088 --> 01:14:30.832
And sure it might be wrapped in
cheap cellophane, shelf stable for like,

01:14:31.550 --> 01:14:32.461
a hundred years.

01:14:33.010 --> 01:14:37.050
Sadly placed somewhere between Little
Debbie's and generic Twinkies on the shelf

01:14:37.139 --> 01:14:38.425
but at the end of the day,

01:14:38.808 --> 01:14:41.095
if it tastes better
than your other options,

01:14:41.686 --> 01:14:42.597
what can you do?

01:14:44.981 --> 01:14:46.188
Have better taste.

01:14:47.024 --> 01:14:48.481
Oh, man. I forgot.

01:14:49.318 --> 01:14:51.435
There is no cake.

01:14:53.114 --> 01:14:54.696
There's no sponge cake.
There's no pound cake.

01:14:54.782 --> 01:14:56.114
There's no shortcake. There's no cake.

01:14:58.995 --> 01:15:01.612
Got caught up in the strawberries I guess.

01:15:02.915 --> 01:15:06.283
Yeah, but... Anyway, there is ice cream,

01:15:06.377 --> 01:15:09.495
which everyone seems to enjoy so...
- Vanilla or chocolate?

01:15:09.588 --> 01:15:11.124
Can we just talk about dinner?

01:15:11.507 --> 01:15:13.043
- The flavor...
- Just for right now?

01:15:13.467 --> 01:15:14.674
Please. Thank you.

01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:15.671
That'd be great.

01:15:15.928 --> 01:15:18.762
So, Jane. Did I say it right this time?

01:15:22.852 --> 01:15:23.763
Yes.

01:15:24.353 --> 01:15:25.889
Hmm. What do you do, Jane?

01:15:26.397 --> 01:15:27.933
Like, for a living?

01:15:28.983 --> 01:15:29.894
Sure.

01:15:30.443 --> 01:15:31.433
I'm a musician,

01:15:32.153 --> 01:15:33.234
mostly at a coffee shop,

01:15:33.821 --> 01:15:35.653
where I also sometimes work...

01:15:36.449 --> 01:15:37.940
because I'm a musician.

01:15:38.325 --> 01:15:40.317
- Mostly at a coffee shop.
- Well would you say that,

01:15:40.619 --> 01:15:42.030
music is your passion?

01:15:42.913 --> 01:15:46.156
- Um, yeah. I mean, it's a passion.
- Yeah. She's really good.

01:15:47.001 --> 01:15:47.912
Pretty great.

01:15:48.461 --> 01:15:50.498
We should go check her out sometime.

01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:52.291
What does that mean?

01:15:52.506 --> 01:15:53.337
What does what mean?

01:15:53.424 --> 01:15:55.256
A... passion.

01:15:56.218 --> 01:15:57.129
I mean,

01:15:57.678 --> 01:15:59.840
a person can have more than one passion.

01:16:00.306 --> 01:16:02.172
- Right?
- You tell me.

01:16:03.768 --> 01:16:04.758
I think I just did.

01:16:07.772 --> 01:16:10.515
- Daniel.
- Um, yeah. I think that...

01:16:11.984 --> 01:16:15.193
I think passion has several different,
uh...

01:16:17.281 --> 01:16:18.237
Like Father Ollie.

01:16:18.991 --> 01:16:21.153
He likes carbohydrates.

01:16:21.827 --> 01:16:22.908
Uh, basketball.

01:16:22.995 --> 01:16:25.453
IU basketball, specifically.

01:16:25.539 --> 01:16:28.873
Thank you very much. You can forget about
the rest of Division I.

01:16:28.959 --> 01:16:31.952
- See? And I really enjoy running, and...
- So.

01:16:32.296 --> 01:16:33.207
The...

01:16:33.839 --> 01:16:35.751
Passion of Christ

01:16:36.884 --> 01:16:38.091
or a...

01:16:38.969 --> 01:16:39.880
passion

01:16:40.387 --> 01:16:41.343
of Christ...

01:16:42.556 --> 01:16:43.512
are interchangeable.

01:16:46.393 --> 01:16:48.931
I think it's different
than what we're talking about.

01:16:49.021 --> 01:16:49.932
Simple question.

01:16:56.362 --> 01:16:57.273
No.

01:16:59.824 --> 01:17:01.190
Obviously not.

01:17:02.827 --> 01:17:03.783
So, Daniel.

01:17:05.579 --> 01:17:08.162
So your new friend could,

01:17:08.833 --> 01:17:11.746
understand
where you're really coming from.

01:17:13.420 --> 01:17:14.706
What is your passion?

01:17:18.926 --> 01:17:20.042
Do you have many passions...

01:17:21.178 --> 01:17:22.089
spread out...

01:17:22.930 --> 01:17:23.841
scattered...

01:17:24.849 --> 01:17:26.841
as Jane seems to.

01:17:29.019 --> 01:17:30.635
Or would you say you have a...

01:17:31.230 --> 01:17:34.348
overriding passion in your life...

01:17:36.235 --> 01:17:38.773
that you have made a serious...

01:17:39.655 --> 01:17:41.487
all-encompassing commitment to.

01:17:43.826 --> 01:17:48.036
I mean, you speak of Ollie's quirks as if,
uh...

01:17:49.206 --> 01:17:50.117
Have you,

01:17:50.708 --> 01:17:52.825
ever, at your worst,

01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:57.412
even considered making God second?

01:17:59.508 --> 01:18:03.047
Have you ever considered
not being such an assface?

01:18:03.304 --> 01:18:04.590
Yes or no?

01:18:04.972 --> 01:18:05.803
Father,

01:18:05.890 --> 01:18:08.303
I think this is something we can more
appropriately address

01:18:08.392 --> 01:18:11.851
- once our guest has...
- Yes or no?

01:18:12.438 --> 01:18:13.349
No...

01:18:13.856 --> 01:18:14.767
dick.

01:18:19.278 --> 01:18:23.272
So, Daniel. We're not quivering
over semantics, or are we

01:18:24.241 --> 01:18:27.279
trying to compare our hobbies

01:18:27.953 --> 01:18:29.160
with our purpose.

01:18:31.248 --> 01:18:32.159
What...

01:18:33.125 --> 01:18:34.036
is...

01:18:34.376 --> 01:18:35.287
your...

01:18:35.878 --> 01:18:36.789
passion?

01:18:37.796 --> 01:18:39.662
- I'm gonna go.
- Afraid of the answer?

01:18:39.965 --> 01:18:41.297
Not half as much as you are.

01:18:41.759 --> 01:18:42.840
It was nice to meet you.

01:18:43.469 --> 01:18:44.710
- Jane you don't have to...
- Let her go.

01:18:47.097 --> 01:18:49.965
Was that supposed to have
some sort of deeper meaning?

01:18:50.059 --> 01:18:50.970
In our work,

01:18:51.268 --> 01:18:53.760
everything has some sort of
deeper meaning.

01:18:54.396 --> 01:18:55.307
Sure.

01:18:58.442 --> 01:18:59.353
See you around.

01:19:01.403 --> 01:19:02.610
God bless, Jessica.

01:19:02.821 --> 01:19:03.982
Eat a dick, father.

01:19:17.294 --> 01:19:18.580
Is there really no cake?

01:19:26.845 --> 01:19:27.756
Really?

01:19:28.347 --> 01:19:29.588
What do you want me to say?

01:19:30.307 --> 01:19:31.923
Can we please talk about this
anywhere else?

01:19:32.017 --> 01:19:33.258
Talk about what? Please?

01:19:33.352 --> 01:19:34.934
Talk about what, Daniel?

01:19:36.397 --> 01:19:38.138
- It's just... She's.
- Us.

01:19:41.318 --> 01:19:42.229
Us?

01:19:43.070 --> 01:19:44.311
I think she means them.

01:19:44.738 --> 01:19:46.445
- Is there something you want to say to me?
- No.

01:19:46.532 --> 01:19:47.443
Bullshit.

01:19:47.533 --> 01:19:48.694
- Nothing happened.
- Bullshit.

01:19:48.784 --> 01:19:50.525
Daniel. Nothing.

01:19:50.619 --> 01:19:51.530
Enough!

01:19:55.833 --> 01:19:56.914
This is not a game.

01:19:58.919 --> 01:20:02.913
You're not trying this out to see if maybe
you're able to make a commitment to God.

01:20:05.551 --> 01:20:06.917
This is how you breathe...

01:20:07.428 --> 01:20:09.841
eat, live, love, everything.

01:20:12.683 --> 01:20:13.594
This is you.

01:20:15.269 --> 01:20:17.135
Father Daniel Jameson.

01:20:19.106 --> 01:20:21.018
I don't know what's going on
between you two.

01:20:23.319 --> 01:20:25.777
- And it sounds like you don't either.
- Nothing.

01:20:31.785 --> 01:20:32.696
It was nothing.

01:21:15.496 --> 01:21:16.407
You're human.

01:21:17.331 --> 01:21:18.242
We all are.

01:21:19.166 --> 01:21:20.407
This is...

01:21:23.921 --> 01:21:25.002
These things happen.

01:21:26.173 --> 01:21:28.711
I'm not asking questions.

01:21:29.802 --> 01:21:30.713
I'm not...

01:21:32.346 --> 01:21:34.713
Whatever happened. Whatever it was,

01:21:35.599 --> 01:21:37.135
all that matters is this:

01:21:37.476 --> 01:21:38.762
What do you believe?

01:21:39.937 --> 01:21:41.348
What do you want, Daniel?

01:21:41.438 --> 01:21:42.849
I want to be a man of God.

01:21:42.940 --> 01:21:44.021
That's all I ever wanted.

01:21:44.358 --> 01:21:46.350
And that's enough, Daniel. That's enough.

01:21:47.653 --> 01:21:48.643
It'll be okay.

01:21:51.281 --> 01:21:52.738
You haven't lost faith, have you?

01:21:55.494 --> 01:21:56.405
No.

01:22:00.207 --> 01:22:01.118
I never had it.

01:22:03.252 --> 01:22:04.493
Until I met her.

01:22:23.355 --> 01:22:24.687
Everything will be okay.

01:22:26.567 --> 01:22:27.774
It's just, we have to...

01:22:29.653 --> 01:22:32.270
It has to be. It has to be.

01:22:36.076 --> 01:22:37.658
Because that's what people say.

01:22:42.791 --> 01:22:43.827
We say that because...

01:22:46.628 --> 01:22:47.618
we think that it will be.

01:22:50.215 --> 01:22:51.126
<i>Think...</i>

01:22:52.468 --> 01:22:53.379
<i>Know...</i>

01:22:54.887 --> 01:22:56.219
<i>hope.</i>

01:23:01.143 --> 01:23:02.634
<i>Because nobody knows, Mom.</i>

01:23:04.104 --> 01:23:05.060
<i>Nobody knows.</i>

01:23:07.858 --> 01:23:09.269
<i>That's why it's called faith.</i>

01:23:15.616 --> 01:23:18.780
I don't. I don't know what you want me to
uh...

01:23:19.745 --> 01:23:21.486
Its... it's not magic.

01:23:22.289 --> 01:23:23.279
It's not magic.

01:23:23.999 --> 01:23:25.410
We're just people. We just...

01:23:26.835 --> 01:23:27.996
<i>We try to be...</i>

01:23:29.087 --> 01:23:31.374
<i>You know, we make choices that, uh...</i>

01:23:34.092 --> 01:23:35.424
<i>We just try to help people.</i>

01:23:49.566 --> 01:23:50.647
I miss him too.

01:23:56.657 --> 01:23:59.365
I know.

01:24:04.998 --> 01:24:06.614
Yeah. Yeah.

01:24:13.924 --> 01:24:14.835
Okay.

01:24:21.223 --> 01:24:22.134
Okay.

01:24:26.311 --> 01:24:27.427
I love you too.

01:25:49.811 --> 01:25:51.973
God is in the details.

01:25:54.941 --> 01:25:57.058
I've hear the same about the devil.

01:26:06.703 --> 01:26:10.322
I suppose it depends on what details
you're focusing on.

01:26:10.707 --> 01:26:11.618
Sorry.

01:26:12.918 --> 01:26:15.956
- We all said things last night that...
- No. For everything.

01:26:18.131 --> 01:26:19.622
It's been a rough year.

01:26:21.968 --> 01:26:22.879
And, uh...

01:26:23.845 --> 01:26:25.211
I just thought that I could...

01:26:28.100 --> 01:26:29.966
That I could... you know I just...

01:26:30.977 --> 01:26:33.094
I don't know. I don't know.

01:26:35.899 --> 01:26:37.310
Oh, bullshit.

01:26:37.401 --> 01:26:38.232
Daniel.

01:26:38.318 --> 01:26:40.810
No. I know exactly what I've been...
I've been.

01:26:42.197 --> 01:26:43.813
You get... lost.

01:26:45.992 --> 01:26:48.700
Just. Everything is about...

01:26:49.871 --> 01:26:51.908
You get caught up in yourself, and uh...

01:26:52.749 --> 01:26:56.208
And I just... Somewhere along the way it
just all became about me.

01:26:56.962 --> 01:26:57.873
And...

01:26:58.797 --> 01:26:59.708
I felt...

01:27:01.925 --> 01:27:02.836
empty...

01:27:04.052 --> 01:27:04.963
spent.

01:27:07.472 --> 01:27:09.805
And I just... I tried.

01:27:11.768 --> 01:27:12.849
But she...

01:27:14.646 --> 01:27:16.137
made me forget about all that.

01:27:17.149 --> 01:27:18.060
You know, she...

01:27:19.067 --> 01:27:20.979
made sense when nothing really did.

01:27:22.279 --> 01:27:26.489
But see that's just me thinking about me
about what I want, and about...

01:27:27.784 --> 01:27:29.320
what makes me feel like I,

01:27:30.620 --> 01:27:31.531
what makes me...

01:27:33.749 --> 01:27:34.785
feel.

01:27:36.293 --> 01:27:39.206
I... I... I don't mean that...
it's not that...

01:27:41.798 --> 01:27:44.381
I made a promise...

01:27:45.135 --> 01:27:49.049
a commitment to something that is bigger
than myself

01:27:49.556 --> 01:27:53.220
and, I can't break that to just...

01:27:56.104 --> 01:27:59.313
- ease my mind. Or my fears. My...
- love

01:28:07.699 --> 01:28:09.281
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

01:28:13.288 --> 01:28:14.199
And I'm back.

01:28:17.417 --> 01:28:18.373
God bless.

01:28:20.545 --> 01:28:21.456
God bless.

01:28:26.176 --> 01:28:27.132
Before you go,

01:28:29.679 --> 01:28:30.669
think I could run

01:28:31.765 --> 01:28:33.256
part of my homily by you?

01:28:33.683 --> 01:28:34.764
You want my feedback?

01:28:38.396 --> 01:28:39.307
Okay.

01:28:39.898 --> 01:28:42.436
Have you been reading much, John lately?

01:28:43.193 --> 01:28:48.359
Yeah. Well, I'm a little bit more of a
Ringo man myself. But...

01:28:50.951 --> 01:28:53.364
- Sorry.
- Laugh pause.

01:28:54.788 --> 01:28:57.201
That actually was pretty funny.

01:28:59.501 --> 01:29:00.412
Trust yourself.

01:29:05.632 --> 01:29:08.124
No one has ever seen God.

01:29:10.345 --> 01:29:12.803
But, if we love each other,

01:29:14.182 --> 01:29:15.718
God lives in us.

01:29:17.686 --> 01:29:18.597
John

01:29:19.312 --> 01:29:20.223
4-12.

01:29:21.314 --> 01:29:24.853
I probably read that over 100 times
in my life.

01:29:25.235 --> 01:29:26.601
I thought I knew what it meant

01:29:27.487 --> 01:29:30.230
but it turns out I never really understood

01:29:31.616 --> 01:29:32.732
much about it at all.

01:29:34.786 --> 01:29:36.527
Seeing God.

01:29:37.581 --> 01:29:40.039
It's not that I don't see him.

01:29:41.334 --> 01:29:42.245
I do.

01:29:43.420 --> 01:29:47.084
It's just that I've always assumed
that it could be done only one way,

01:29:49.009 --> 01:29:50.716
through prayer,

01:29:51.219 --> 01:29:52.175
through faith,

01:29:52.512 --> 01:29:55.471
through the perfect ritual of mass.

01:29:56.474 --> 01:29:57.590
If it worked for me,

01:29:58.435 --> 01:29:59.767
why not everyone else?

01:30:03.940 --> 01:30:06.182
If we love each other,

01:30:08.028 --> 01:30:09.564
God lives in us.

01:30:11.364 --> 01:30:13.105
What does that really mean?

01:30:14.618 --> 01:30:17.406
love itself cannot be defined or...

01:30:19.414 --> 01:30:20.450
understood, or...

01:30:20.832 --> 01:30:21.993
Quantified...

01:30:23.710 --> 01:30:24.621
denied.

01:30:28.340 --> 01:30:31.378
If God is a mystery,

01:30:32.385 --> 01:30:34.251
love probably is as well.

01:30:36.431 --> 01:30:38.423
Because, at the end of the day,

01:30:39.684 --> 01:30:42.643
after a lifetime of theological study,

01:30:44.230 --> 01:30:47.064
my knowledge of love and God

01:30:48.068 --> 01:30:52.233
amounts to little more
than these two truths:

01:30:54.491 --> 01:30:55.402
One:

01:30:56.493 --> 01:30:57.734
they both exist.

01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:00.156
And two:

01:31:01.164 --> 01:31:05.158
when it comes to the matters of God
and the matters of love,

01:31:08.254 --> 01:31:10.246
I can no longer tell the difference.

01:31:12.884 --> 01:31:14.091
And for this,

01:31:16.179 --> 01:31:17.511
I feel blessed.
