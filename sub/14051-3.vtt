WEBVTT

00:48.400 --> 00:50.280
RICHARD: So, morning team briefing.

00:50.320 --> 00:53.080
I thought we should sharpen things up a little and start

00:50.320 --> 00:53.080
each day as we...

00:54.280 --> 00:55.480
...mean to go on.

00:56.360 --> 00:57.360
Fidel?

01:02.280 --> 01:03.320
Oh.

01:05.080 --> 01:07.080
FIDEL: Sorry, chief.

01:07.120 --> 01:12.040
It's just that Crazy Ally was throwing a Full Moon party

01:07.120 --> 01:12.040
last night and, well...

01:12.080 --> 01:15.760
Yeah, your self destructive link to the lunar cycle

01:15.800 --> 01:19.920
is well documented so, er, let's just leave it there, shall we?

01:19.960 --> 01:21.040
All of it.

01:22.560 --> 01:25.040
You think it'll be quiet here again today?

01:25.080 --> 01:27.160
The phone hardly rang at all yesterday.

01:27.200 --> 01:30.920
It's too hot. No-one's got enough energy

01:27.200 --> 01:30.920
to break the law.

01:36.680 --> 01:38.400
Ms Smythe.

01:38.440 --> 01:41.160
Carlton. Lovely day.

02:47.680 --> 02:51.240
So, er, what do we know about this place?

02:51.280 --> 02:54.400
The Jacaranda Clinic. Specialises in

02:51.280 --> 02:54.400
cosmetic procedures.

02:56.720 --> 02:58.480
Well, you book in for a face lift,

02:58.520 --> 03:00.360
then spend the next two weeks sitting by the pool.

03:00.400 --> 03:03.560
By which time all trace of the surgeon's knife

03:00.400 --> 03:03.560
has disappeared.

03:03.600 --> 03:06.960
And the secret of your eternal youth is safe for another year.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.320
The clinic is owned by an English surgeon,

03:07.000 --> 03:10.320
Jeremy Tipping.

03:10.360 --> 03:11.880
He's been on the island for years.

03:11.920 --> 03:14.560
Got the big yacht in the harbour and everything.

03:14.600 --> 03:17.480
A real beauty. Even has a Jacuzzi!

03:17.520 --> 03:20.120
Police. We've come about the corpse?

03:26.040 --> 03:27.560
Impressive. Mm.

03:28.440 --> 03:31.400
I meant the ambience. Clearly.

03:31.440 --> 03:34.840
-Well, it gives me the creeps.

03:31.440 --> 03:34.840
It's so impersonal. They all arrive in their big

03:34.880 --> 03:38.280
black cars and then just disappear again.

03:38.320 --> 03:41.120
I doubt if anyone here sees anything of the island.

03:41.160 --> 03:43.560
It's just like they've never actually been here at all.

03:43.600 --> 03:45.480
Ah! Inspector?

03:47.920 --> 03:48.960
This way.

03:55.160 --> 03:57.760
No, I haven't had a face lift, Inspector.

03:57.800 --> 04:00.520
I come here for physiotherapy. An old sports injury.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.120
Mala. My physiotherapist.

04:05.160 --> 04:06.440
Beautiful hands.

04:10.560 --> 04:12.680
Her name was Valerie Dupree.

04:13.480 --> 04:14.960
French.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.760
Apparently her husband had just left her for a younger woman.

04:17.800 --> 04:21.400
So, the staff and I think it's a simple case of suicide.

04:21.440 --> 04:23.480
-Yes.

04:23.520 --> 04:26.360
I understand she swam most evenings.

04:26.400 --> 04:28.680
How sad you must be to take your own life.

04:28.720 --> 04:30.880
RICHARD: Well, let's not jump to conclusions.

04:30.920 --> 04:32.440
Selwyn!

04:32.480 --> 04:34.280
-Hello! -Jeremy.

04:34.320 --> 04:38.040
This is Detective Inspector Richard Poole, Sergeant Bordey.

04:38.080 --> 04:40.880
A pleasure. I'm sorry we're not meeting in better circumstances.

04:40.920 --> 04:43.520
Quite. And Mrs Dupree was last seen alive when?

04:43.560 --> 04:46.360
Erm, I understand her nurse saw her yesterday evening.

04:46.400 --> 04:47.800
And the body was discovered?

04:47.840 --> 04:51.360
First thing this morning. One of our guests found her.

04:51.400 --> 04:54.360
We will try to keep the disruption to

04:51.400 --> 04:54.360
a minimum, Jeremy.

04:55.400 --> 04:57.000
Isn't that right, Inspector?

04:59.560 --> 05:01.640
Yes. Absolutely.

05:01.680 --> 05:04.080
Good. Well I'll just go and get dressed.

05:17.640 --> 05:20.080
Er, the ambulance has been held up,

05:20.120 --> 05:22.920
so Dwayne and Fidel are moving the body inside.

05:22.960 --> 05:25.280
-Out of sight.

05:25.320 --> 05:27.440
Oh right, yeah.

05:28.400 --> 05:30.680
You know this pot's been moved.

05:30.720 --> 05:32.880
And, er, it's been chipped. Look.

05:34.600 --> 05:37.000
This is just awful. The poor woman.

05:37.040 --> 05:40.200
I was just in town, I just got back.

05:40.240 --> 05:42.960
Sorry, erm, I'm Anna Jones. Erm, Doctor Anna Jones.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.120
-Yes, I'm the general manager.

05:46.160 --> 05:48.240
-Of psychology.

05:48.280 --> 05:51.440
Oh? Part of my job is that I screen the clients.

05:51.480 --> 05:54.080
CAMILLE: Oh, so, you must have examined Mrs Dupree?

05:54.120 --> 05:55.840
Yeah, I did.

05:55.880 --> 05:58.840
Erm, which I'm not feeling particularly comfortable

05:55.880 --> 05:58.840
with right now.

05:58.880 --> 06:01.760
She was clearly depressed.

06:01.800 --> 06:05.080
Her husband of 25 years had just started divorce proceedings.

06:05.120 --> 06:08.600
But I, I honestly thought that the cosmetic procedure

06:08.640 --> 06:13.160
would give her a fresh start, you know, help her feelings

06:08.640 --> 06:13.160
of low self esteem.

06:15.560 --> 06:16.960
Sorry, I'm so sorry.

06:19.640 --> 06:20.960
Hello?

06:21.000 --> 06:24.440
Hi, yes, Mrs Katzenburg. Mm-hmm, yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:24.480 --> 06:28.040
Can I call you back? Yes, in five minutes.

06:24.480 --> 06:28.040
Thank you. Okay, bye.

06:29.800 --> 06:31.680
Is there anything else I can help you with?

06:31.720 --> 06:34.000
If we could just see Mrs Dupree's room?

06:34.040 --> 06:37.400
-Then we can get out of your way.

06:34.040 --> 06:37.400
-Yes, absolutely. It's this way.

06:39.440 --> 06:41.880
-Hmm, yes, yeah.

06:42.680 --> 06:43.840
Coming.

06:47.280 --> 06:49.400
Erm, Carlton here took care of her,

06:49.440 --> 06:52.320
-so he can show you everything you need.

06:49.440 --> 06:52.320
-Thank you.

06:52.360 --> 06:54.720
-Oh, sorry about this.

06:55.320 --> 06:56.560
Erm, yes?

06:57.200 --> 06:59.120
Right, aha.

06:59.160 --> 07:01.920
So, how well did you know Mrs Dupree?

07:01.960 --> 07:03.680
It was her first visit here.

07:04.800 --> 07:06.280
And you last saw her, when?

07:07.320 --> 07:09.920
Drug round. 'Bout 9.30pm?

07:09.960 --> 07:13.440
All the patients get heparin, Mr Tipping is very insistent.

07:13.480 --> 07:14.640
Heparin?

07:14.680 --> 07:17.120
An injectable anticoagulant.

07:17.160 --> 07:20.640
Enables wound-healing by preventing

07:17.160 --> 07:20.640
blood clot formation.

07:20.680 --> 07:21.680
Right.

07:22.800 --> 07:26.280
So you gave her the injection as normal?

07:27.200 --> 07:28.600
Sure.

07:28.640 --> 07:30.240
<i>Same as every night.</i>

07:34.160 --> 07:36.120
Did you speak to her?

07:36.160 --> 07:38.200
Dr Jones is very particular.

07:38.240 --> 07:41.360
She doesn't encourage conversation with the clients.

07:41.400 --> 07:44.680
So, assuming she died some time that night,

07:44.720 --> 07:47.800
you may well be the last person to see her alive?

07:47.840 --> 07:49.320
I couldn't say.

07:49.360 --> 07:51.200
She was my last patient on the round.

07:51.240 --> 07:53.480
I just give her the injection and go straight home.

07:55.640 --> 07:58.800
CAMILLE: All right, thank you. We'll be fine from here.

08:06.640 --> 08:07.680
No note?

08:10.080 --> 08:11.640
Do you know what this is?

08:11.680 --> 08:14.480
Er, hmm, tea?

08:15.320 --> 08:16.520
Not any old tea.

08:17.320 --> 08:19.240
This is Da Hong Pao.

08:19.280 --> 08:20.680
CAMILLE: Hmm.

08:20.720 --> 08:22.840
You know, gram for gram this is more expensive than gold.

08:26.040 --> 08:27.160
Hmm?

08:28.520 --> 08:31.200
Camellia sinensis, if I recall correctly.

08:32.680 --> 08:34.520
You know when Nixon visited China,

08:35.920 --> 08:38.000
they gave him two ounces of this as a gift.

08:38.640 --> 08:40.800
Two ounces! Imagine.

08:44.840 --> 08:46.280
It's half empty.

08:48.960 --> 08:52.680
Well you go to the trouble of making yourself a cup of the

08:48.960 --> 08:52.680
most expensive tea in the world.

08:52.720 --> 08:55.080
-Oh, I love this bag! -Ahem!

08:55.120 --> 08:58.960
You go to the trouble of making yourself a cup of the most

08:55.120 --> 08:58.960
expensive tea in the world

08:59.000 --> 09:02.640
and then halfway through, you put down the cup, go out to

08:59.000 --> 09:02.640
the pool and drown yourself?

09:02.680 --> 09:05.320
People can be spontaneous. They do strange things.

09:06.200 --> 09:08.160
I disagree.

09:08.200 --> 09:12.120
You know, throughout my career I've found them to

09:08.200 --> 09:12.120
be surprisingly predictable,

09:12.160 --> 09:15.280
provided you truly understand their motives, of course.

09:15.320 --> 09:18.680
So, why drink only half a cup of tea?

09:18.720 --> 09:21.560
Maybe she used it to wash down the rest of these?

09:27.960 --> 09:29.720
-Diazepam. -Mm-hmm.

09:30.560 --> 09:32.000
Sleeping tablets.

09:32.040 --> 09:36.240
Tea or no tea, the truth is that this woman felt so alone,

09:36.280 --> 09:38.760
so miserable, that she'd take her own life.

09:38.800 --> 09:41.000
While I disapprove of assumptions in principle,

09:41.040 --> 09:42.600
in this case, you may be right. There's nothing here. Let's go.

09:52.200 --> 09:54.040
I know what you're thinking, Sergeant Bordey,

09:54.080 --> 09:56.440
but this is very probably the last thing she drank

09:56.480 --> 09:59.640
before she committed suicide and, as such, we should test it.

09:59.680 --> 10:01.320
You mean you should test it?

10:02.120 --> 10:03.240
Absolutely.

10:10.080 --> 10:12.720
I'm surprised they don't get that fixed, the money

10:10.080 --> 10:12.720
they charge.

10:12.760 --> 10:16.200
Must be like being pushed around on a supermarket trolley.

10:16.240 --> 10:19.280
We found this in her dressing gown pocket, sir. Nothing else.

10:19.320 --> 10:21.320
Well, see what you can recover from it.

10:21.360 --> 10:23.160
Last calls, surviving prints.

10:23.200 --> 10:26.000
We may at least be able to determine time

10:23.200 --> 10:26.000
of death for the coroner.

10:26.040 --> 10:27.080
Sure.

10:32.840 --> 10:34.720
Well, team

10:36.880 --> 10:38.720
Most likely suicide.

10:38.760 --> 10:40.640
So, just as I said?

10:40.680 --> 10:42.520
-Yes. -Apart from the tea.

10:45.080 --> 10:48.720
-Yes, Valerie Dupree made

10:45.080 --> 10:48.720
herself an expensive pot of tea,

10:48.760 --> 10:49.880
yet failed to drink it.

10:55.480 --> 10:59.600
There are some important people at the clinic, Inspector.

10:59.640 --> 11:01.960
Rich people with great influence.

11:02.000 --> 11:06.120
All of whom we want to welcome to the island with open arms.

11:07.080 --> 11:09.000
I'm sure you understand me?

11:10.520 --> 11:11.680
Yes, sir.

11:27.320 --> 11:29.360
Liming?

11:29.400 --> 11:31.200
-Of course it is.

11:31.240 --> 11:34.680
It means hanging out with your friends and having a beer.

11:34.720 --> 11:37.840
-You know, taking it easy, relaxing.

11:34.720 --> 11:37.840
Mm.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.560
Liming.

11:44.480 --> 11:46.960
The pathologist's report on the suicide lady.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.040
-Seems so.

11:50.080 --> 11:53.720
Cause of death, hypoxia, cardiac arrest.

11:53.760 --> 11:55.440
Chlorinated water found in lungs,

11:55.480 --> 11:59.040
correlates with suicide by drowning, no sign of trauma.

11:59.080 --> 12:00.320
Apart from...

12:02.200 --> 12:06.040
Recent surgery to the face, thought

12:02.200 --> 12:06.040
to be cosmetic in nature.

12:06.080 --> 12:08.760
Blood tests showed traces of glycosaminoglycan,

12:08.800 --> 12:12.280
which tallies with reported anticoagulant

12:08.800 --> 12:12.280
unfractionated heparin.

12:12.720 --> 12:13.760
That's it.

12:14.840 --> 12:16.000
What about the diazepam?

12:16.840 --> 12:18.400
Sir?

12:18.440 --> 12:19.960
In her blood.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.760
There's no sign of that here.

12:21.800 --> 12:24.720
But we found an empty bottle of diazepam in her room.

12:24.760 --> 12:26.280
That's what we assumed she took.

12:26.320 --> 12:28.320
Well, there's nothing here.

12:28.360 --> 12:30.280
It could have worked its way through her system?

12:30.320 --> 12:32.800
Not a dose big enough to knock her out.

12:32.840 --> 12:34.120
What about her medical records?

12:34.160 --> 12:36.960
Any history of blackouts, fainting?

12:37.000 --> 12:38.440
No.

12:38.480 --> 12:42.240
Any long term medical condition at all Seizures?

12:42.280 --> 12:44.880
-No, nothing. -Maybe she just slipped

12:42.280 --> 12:44.880
and fell?

12:44.920 --> 12:48.080
Then where's the trauma Broken skin?

12:48.600 --> 12:50.920
There isn't any.

12:50.960 --> 12:56.280
So, a reasonably fit and able swimmer, Valerie Dupree,

12:56.320 --> 12:59.560
makes herself a very expensive cup of tea,

12:59.600 --> 13:02.280
then takes barely a single sip

13:02.320 --> 13:03.920
before leaving her room

13:03.960 --> 13:08.440
and walking to the swimming pool and throwing herself in.

13:08.480 --> 13:11.480
Then, using nothing more than her own willpower,

13:11.520 --> 13:15.360
she holds herself down under the water until she drowns.

13:15.400 --> 13:17.920
So you're saying it wasn't a suicide?

13:17.960 --> 13:20.400
And it couldn't have been an accident?

13:20.920 --> 13:22.320
Which means?

13:22.360 --> 13:25.600
Somehow, as unlikely as it seems...

13:27.160 --> 13:28.280
...I think she was murdered.

13:33.560 --> 13:36.400
Well, the pathologist's report was clear.

13:36.440 --> 13:39.520
There were no other factors in her death, she drowned.

13:40.200 --> 13:42.160
How can that be?

13:42.200 --> 13:44.680
Maybe someone held her in the pool.

13:44.720 --> 13:47.040
The only logical explanation. And yet...

13:47.760 --> 13:48.960
What?

13:49.000 --> 13:50.960
Well, imagine you're taking a midnight swim

13:51.000 --> 13:52.360
and I decide to drown you.

13:53.120 --> 13:54.280
What do you do?

13:58.840 --> 14:00.560
Okay, let me rephrase that.

14:00.600 --> 14:02.880
-You're not a trained police officer.

14:02.920 --> 14:06.840
No, you're a depressed woman with no apparent aptitude

14:02.920 --> 14:06.840
for self defence.

14:06.880 --> 14:12.120
Oh, okay, all right. Well, then, I'm drowning,

14:06.880 --> 14:12.120
struggling for air,

14:12.160 --> 14:13.240
I guess I'd struggle.

14:15.040 --> 14:17.440
Yet the victim showed no signs of restraint bruising

14:17.480 --> 14:19.240
to the neck or shoulders.

14:19.280 --> 14:22.880
No hyoid bone fracture, you know.

14:22.920 --> 14:26.160
Try and subdue her and her characteristic

14:22.920 --> 14:26.160
injury patterns

14:26.200 --> 14:28.240
would be impossible to avoid.

14:28.280 --> 14:31.480
Well, what if it was just a little push down in

14:28.280 --> 14:31.480
the back of the...

14:31.520 --> 14:33.160
No, you don't, no, you don't.

14:33.200 --> 14:35.400
No, I mean, whichever way you do it, I think

14:33.200 --> 14:35.400
we've established

14:35.440 --> 14:37.920
it's impossible to hold someone down, under water,

14:37.960 --> 14:39.320
without giving them so much as a bruise.

14:41.840 --> 14:43.440
And then there's the tea conundrum.

14:44.440 --> 14:45.680
Detective inspector.

14:47.160 --> 14:49.680
-I'm afraid there is.

14:49.720 --> 14:51.320
Perhaps you could enlighten me.

14:51.360 --> 14:55.400
We're no longer sure that Valerie Dupree's

14:51.360 --> 14:55.400
drowning was a suicide.

14:55.440 --> 14:57.680
I don't... I don't think I understand.

14:57.720 --> 14:59.800
You're suggesting it was some kind of accident?

14:59.840 --> 15:01.160
I'm suggesting she was murdered.

15:03.400 --> 15:04.880
Well, that's nonsense.

15:04.920 --> 15:06.880
We're going to need a complete list of your staff and clients.

15:06.920 --> 15:10.240
But just hang on a minute, what are you basing this

15:06.920 --> 15:10.240
assertion on?

15:10.280 --> 15:11.680
Well, that's a police matter.

15:11.720 --> 15:13.560
If you could just provide me with what I've asked for.

15:13.600 --> 15:16.120
Absolutely not. That's confidential information.

15:16.160 --> 15:19.240
Sorry, but as I'm now treating this as a murder

15:16.160 --> 15:19.240
enquiry, I must insist.

15:19.280 --> 15:21.080
We can always get a warrant.

15:21.120 --> 15:23.600
And until the investigation is complete, I'm going to

15:21.120 --> 15:23.600
have to request

15:23.640 --> 15:26.080
that you close the clinic, temporarily.

15:26.120 --> 15:28.400
No-one enters, no-one leaves.

15:28.440 --> 15:29.840
And we'll be confiscating passports.

15:29.880 --> 15:31.480
You're imprisoning my clients?

15:31.520 --> 15:33.720
Just until the interviews have been completed

15:33.760 --> 15:36.520
and they've been eliminated from our enquiries.

15:42.880 --> 15:48.520
I mean, the poor woman was just floating there. Face down!

15:48.560 --> 15:51.200
Can I ask you how well you knew Mrs Dupree?

15:51.240 --> 15:53.000
Oh, not at all, really. I mean, we just passed

15:53.040 --> 15:54.800
the time of day.

15:54.840 --> 15:56.960
Her husband was rich, I know that.

15:57.960 --> 15:59.440
She was a feisty one.

15:59.480 --> 16:01.480
You should have heard her on the phone to him.

16:01.520 --> 16:04.480
Well, one assumes it was her husband.

16:04.520 --> 16:07.040
<i>One couldn't help overhearing.</i>

16:07.080 --> 16:09.520
<i>She was quite animated</i> <i>about something.</i>

16:09.560 --> 16:12.440
Would you say she was angry or upset?

16:12.480 --> 16:14.080
I'd say both.

16:14.120 --> 16:18.440
I mean, everyone divorces in the same language,

16:14.120 --> 16:18.440
don't they?

16:18.480 --> 16:22.080
Besides, after three useless husbands, one learns the signs.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.840
So you're not married now?

16:24.880 --> 16:26.400
I was. Yes.

16:27.600 --> 16:29.920
Three tries to finally get it right

16:29.960 --> 16:33.000
and then my darling number four goes and dies on me.

16:34.520 --> 16:35.600
You must miss him.

16:37.680 --> 16:38.920
Yes, I do.

16:40.120 --> 16:41.800
We just had so much fun together.

16:41.840 --> 16:44.160
Well, if you want to have some fun,

16:44.200 --> 16:46.960
maybe you should see some more of our island.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.040
Why come all this way and not experience it?

16:49.080 --> 16:52.760
Well, because everything I need is right here.

16:52.800 --> 16:57.400
If you change your mind and want to see more

16:52.800 --> 16:57.400
of the real Saint Marie,

16:57.440 --> 16:58.840
this is my mother's bar.

16:58.880 --> 17:02.760
Oh, thank you. That's very kind.

17:02.800 --> 17:04.040
My pleasure.

17:04.960 --> 17:06.880
Okay, I think we're done here.

17:06.920 --> 17:10.880
So if you think there is anything else

17:06.920 --> 17:10.880
might be important?

17:12.280 --> 17:15.320
Well, since you ask.

17:16.800 --> 17:21.400
Now, I'm not one to gossip, but I had started to wonder

17:21.440 --> 17:26.000
whether she wasn't one of those older women

17:21.440 --> 17:26.000
who prey on younger men.

17:26.040 --> 17:27.520
-Oh. -Sexually.

17:27.560 --> 17:30.800
Yes. Anyone in particular?

17:30.840 --> 17:31.960
Ah.

17:34.240 --> 17:37.080
I think they were having some kind of lover's tiff.

17:38.360 --> 17:41.440
I couldn't hear what was being said

17:41.480 --> 17:43.400
but it all sounded terribly passionate.

17:50.920 --> 17:52.640
I appreciate you've got more questions,

17:52.680 --> 17:54.760
but my patient's already on the table.

17:54.800 --> 17:57.720
Well, quite frankly, as head of this establishment,

17:57.760 --> 18:00.000
I would hope that I could count on your cooperation.

18:00.880 --> 18:05.720
Yes, yes, well, quite right.

18:05.760 --> 18:08.920
Look, why don't we both act like proper Englishmen

18:05.760 --> 18:08.920
and compromise?

18:08.960 --> 18:10.600
Come and join me in theatre

18:10.640 --> 18:12.640
-and I'll do my best to answer your questions there.

18:12.680 --> 18:16.520
Actually, it'll be nice to have some time to chew the fat

18:12.680 --> 18:16.520
with a fellow countryman.

18:17.360 --> 18:18.920
Changing room's this way.

18:21.280 --> 18:23.160
So you weren't in a relationship with her?

18:23.200 --> 18:24.760
Absolutely not.

18:24.800 --> 18:27.120
-In my room.

18:27.160 --> 18:29.440
-Yeah. Worse luck.

18:30.040 --> 18:32.080
Hmm.

18:32.120 --> 18:33.600
Is there anything else I can help you with?

18:33.640 --> 18:35.840
Yes. I'd like your passport.

18:44.320 --> 18:47.760
JEREMY: Can we get some more light here, please?

18:44.320 --> 18:47.760
I can't see a thing.

18:47.800 --> 18:51.840
It's like trying to operate in The Black Hole of Calcutta.

18:51.880 --> 18:54.000
Oh, slightly better.

18:57.440 --> 18:59.480
RICHARD: Ah, you're operating on her...

19:00.600 --> 19:02.560
Right. Good.

19:02.600 --> 19:05.120
Not sure this is quite the...

19:05.160 --> 19:07.520
Beautiful woman, perfectly equipped.

19:07.560 --> 19:09.240
Now, you tell me,

19:09.280 --> 19:11.000
are these too small?

19:11.040 --> 19:12.080
Well, I wouldn't...

19:13.080 --> 19:14.400
Hold this for me, would you?

19:18.920 --> 19:21.240
I did what I always do.

19:21.280 --> 19:24.120
Worked until ten and then I went home, took the phone

19:21.280 --> 19:24.120
off the hook.

19:25.560 --> 19:27.720
With a job like this, you need your downtime.

19:27.760 --> 19:29.440
Clients can be pretty demanding.

19:30.720 --> 19:34.240
I can imagine. And Dr Tipping?

19:34.280 --> 19:35.400
Mr.

19:35.440 --> 19:39.240
He's a surgeon. They're always a Mr.

19:39.280 --> 19:41.800
Don't forget it. It's guaranteed to set him off.

19:41.840 --> 19:44.320
So, he can be difficult?

19:44.360 --> 19:45.920
He has a temper.

19:45.960 --> 19:48.680
But he's an artist, a perfectionist,

19:48.720 --> 19:50.920
and people like that need everything to be just so.

19:50.960 --> 19:53.440
I spent the night on my yacht.

19:53.480 --> 19:56.040
Caught up on a bit of correspondence,

19:56.080 --> 19:59.240
polished off the last of the single malt

19:56.080 --> 19:59.240
and then turned in.

19:59.280 --> 20:01.880
And can anyone confirm that or...

20:01.920 --> 20:03.560
You could take my word for it.

20:04.840 --> 20:07.480
Failing that, the harbour master should back me up.

20:07.520 --> 20:10.080
Our clientele are rich, important people.

20:10.120 --> 20:13.600
You can understand why they insist on total discretion.

20:13.640 --> 20:17.000
Which is why you discourage your nurses from even

20:13.640 --> 20:17.000
talking to them?

20:17.040 --> 20:19.400
We're a sanctuary, Detective Bordey.

20:19.440 --> 20:21.880
There's no autographs, no chit-chat.

20:21.920 --> 20:24.080
Our staff are paid well to obey the rules.

20:24.120 --> 20:26.440
-This is a business first and a hospital second.

20:26.480 --> 20:28.000
Oh, sorry.

20:28.040 --> 20:30.240
Hello? Uh-huh.

20:30.280 --> 20:33.520
Okay, yeah, tell her I can deal

20:30.280 --> 20:33.520
with it right away.

20:33.560 --> 20:36.720
Look, I have to deal with this. If there's anything else

20:33.560 --> 20:36.720
I can help you with?

20:43.600 --> 20:46.160
Could you... Finger should do it.

20:53.080 --> 20:56.200
To tell the truth, economic meltdown

20:53.080 --> 20:56.200
and all that, we were,

20:56.240 --> 20:57.840
we were struggling.

20:57.880 --> 21:00.360
Anna came along with a new marketing strategy,

20:57.880 --> 21:00.360
encouraged me

21:00.400 --> 21:02.240
to push the whole privacy thing.

21:02.280 --> 21:06.760
Top class clients, total discretion assured.

21:06.800 --> 21:10.560
And now here we are, one big, happy family.

21:10.600 --> 21:12.960
Light! I need light for God's sake!

21:16.080 --> 21:18.880
Well, I'm glad you find it amusing, I could be

21:16.080 --> 21:18.880
scarred for life.

21:21.680 --> 21:25.720
Mrs Dupree was last seen around 9.30pm by her nurse,

21:21.680 --> 21:25.720
Carlton Reynolds.

21:25.760 --> 21:27.720
He gave her medication of heparin.

21:27.760 --> 21:31.680
Dr Jones finished work and left the clinic shortly after 10pm

21:31.720 --> 21:33.480
and spent the evening alone at home.

21:33.520 --> 21:35.880
Mr Tipping says he was on his boat.

21:35.920 --> 21:39.320
The harbour master confirms he saw lights on the boat,

21:39.360 --> 21:41.680
of course, that doesn't mean he was actually there.

21:41.720 --> 21:43.800
One thing did come up, though, Jayne Smythe thought

21:43.840 --> 21:47.400
that Mrs Dupree may have had a lover's tiff with one

21:43.840 --> 21:47.400
of the other guests.

21:47.440 --> 21:50.880
-Paul Vincent.

21:47.440 --> 21:50.880
He denies the liaison.

21:50.920 --> 21:53.680
Says he's having a...blepharoplasty?

21:53.720 --> 21:56.240
Eyelid tuck, from the Greek. And do you believe him?

21:56.840 --> 21:57.880
About Mrs Dupree?

21:58.440 --> 22:01.360
Oh, yes, I do.

22:01.400 --> 22:06.200
Chief! The Commissioner's at the station,

22:01.400 --> 22:06.200
he's looking for you.

22:06.240 --> 22:07.600
He doesn't seem very happy.

22:22.080 --> 22:24.720
I thought I made it perfectly clear.

22:24.760 --> 22:28.480
Any disruption at the clinic was to be kept to

22:24.760 --> 22:28.480
an absolute minimum.

22:29.840 --> 22:33.400
Next you're confiscating passports?

22:33.440 --> 22:36.280
Then you announce it's no longer a suicide,

22:36.320 --> 22:38.800
but a full blown murder enquiry.

22:38.840 --> 22:41.360
Yes, well, there were significant inconsistencies.

22:41.400 --> 22:43.320
Inconsistencies?

22:45.880 --> 22:48.120
Well, we were led to believe that Valerie Dupree

22:48.160 --> 22:51.680
drowned despite being fit, healthy and a competent swimmer.

22:54.080 --> 22:57.760
We found an empty pill bottle in her room, but no

22:54.080 --> 22:57.760
sign of that medication

22:57.800 --> 23:00.080
in her bloodstream and, and finally,

23:00.120 --> 23:03.160
she makes herself a very expensive cup of tea

23:03.200 --> 23:06.520
and walks out and kills herself halfway through drinking it.

23:07.560 --> 23:09.120
The tea conundrum.

23:10.960 --> 23:15.600
Tell me, at least you've managed to establish

23:10.960 --> 23:15.600
some kind of motive.

23:15.640 --> 23:19.080
A reason anyone would have wanted her dead?

23:19.120 --> 23:20.200
Well, we're working on that, sir.

23:21.280 --> 23:22.320
All right.

23:24.200 --> 23:27.400
Talk me through the murder. How was she killed?

23:30.760 --> 23:34.080
-Well, we're working on that, too, sir.

23:40.200 --> 23:45.360
So the sum total of the evidence that led you

23:40.200 --> 23:45.360
to put this island's

23:45.400 --> 23:50.040
most wealthy and most influential people under

23:45.400 --> 23:50.040
virtual house arrest

23:50.080 --> 23:56.400
consists of a few inconsistencies and a half-drunk

23:50.080 --> 23:56.400
cup of tea.

24:27.240 --> 24:29.520
I'm going to let you run with this...

24:29.560 --> 24:31.280
...for now.

24:31.320 --> 24:34.240
Not because I think you're right,

24:34.280 --> 24:40.720
but simply because there is something I've always wanted

24:34.280 --> 24:40.720
to say since I joined the force.

24:40.760 --> 24:43.640
You've got 24 hours to solve this case.

24:45.160 --> 24:46.920
Do we understand each other?

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
Yes, sir. Sir.

25:01.640 --> 25:02.640
Commissioner.

25:09.280 --> 25:11.120
He says he has every faith in us.

25:11.160 --> 25:12.480
So let's set up the board.

25:13.080 --> 25:15.120
-Dwayne. -Chief.

25:15.160 --> 25:18.160
Go through the passports, I want full background checks

25:15.160 --> 25:18.160
on everyone at the clinic,

25:18.200 --> 25:19.800
-staff and guests. -I'm on it.

25:19.840 --> 25:21.080
-Fidel. -Sir.

25:21.120 --> 25:23.400
The victim was seen angry during a phone call.

25:23.440 --> 25:26.480
Everyone assumes it was with her wayward husband,

25:23.440 --> 25:26.480
let's double check.

25:26.520 --> 25:28.080
-Sir. -Camille.

25:28.120 --> 25:30.880
I want you to have another crack

25:28.120 --> 25:30.880
at this Paul Vincent.

25:30.920 --> 25:32.960
We have a witness saying they'd had a disagreement.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.720
If they weren't having an affair, what were

25:33.000 --> 25:35.720
they talking about?

25:35.760 --> 25:37.800
Threaten to arrest him for wasting police time.

25:37.840 --> 25:39.040
It will be my pleasure.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.920
I thought we'd done this. I told you, I hardly knew

25:42.000 --> 25:44.920
the woman.

25:44.960 --> 25:47.120
Yeah, I believe you weren't having an affair.

25:47.160 --> 25:50.000
But we still have a witness who saw an argument.

25:50.040 --> 25:51.160
We weren't arguing.

25:51.200 --> 25:52.840
-Look...

25:55.280 --> 25:57.000
How about we make a deal?

25:57.040 --> 26:01.360
I'll answer your questions if you give me my passport back.

26:01.400 --> 26:03.320
I run my own business and our biggest client

26:03.360 --> 26:06.600
is on the verge of switching to a rival supplier.

26:06.640 --> 26:08.080
What kind of business?

26:08.120 --> 26:09.720
Flowers.

26:09.760 --> 26:11.480
So you're a florist?

26:11.520 --> 26:12.960
It's the perfect product.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.440
Perishable, constant demand.

26:15.480 --> 26:18.680
I built the firm up from nothing and now we've got 20 people

26:15.480 --> 26:18.680
on the payroll.

26:18.720 --> 26:22.840
And if I don't get back to talk to my clients in person,

26:18.720 --> 26:22.840
we'll all be out of a job.

26:24.800 --> 26:27.320
Okay, we can do a deal.

26:27.360 --> 26:30.760
You answer my questions and maybe I won't arrest you.

26:31.440 --> 26:33.280
Look.

26:33.320 --> 26:39.040
I tried my best to be nice, but she just wouldn't take

26:33.320 --> 26:39.040
no for an answer.

26:39.080 --> 26:42.680
In the end, I had to make my feelings clear.

26:42.720 --> 26:46.240
-That's it.

26:42.720 --> 26:46.240
She didn't like it.

26:46.280 --> 26:49.320
I didn't want a big drama so I went back to my room

26:46.280 --> 26:49.320
and stayed there.

26:49.360 --> 26:52.480
Ah, which means you still have no alibi.

26:52.520 --> 26:56.440
So business or not, there's no way I can sanction

26:52.520 --> 26:56.440
you leaving the island.

26:56.480 --> 26:58.560
What if someone could prove where I was?

27:02.440 --> 27:05.640
So you don't deny you spent the whole night

27:02.440 --> 27:05.640
in Paul Vincent's room?

27:05.680 --> 27:08.280
-No. -Then why lie

27:05.680 --> 27:08.280
and say you went home?

27:08.320 --> 27:11.600
I forbid my staff from even starting conversations

27:08.320 --> 27:11.600
with the clients.

27:11.640 --> 27:15.360
So how would it look if they knew I was

27:11.640 --> 27:15.360
sleeping with one of them?

27:15.400 --> 27:18.000
You know, I can't imagine what Mr Tipping would do.

27:19.320 --> 27:21.320
What time did you go and meet him?

27:21.360 --> 27:26.240
So I went after I finished work and Carlton, he was leaving.

27:26.280 --> 27:27.800
CAMILLE:<i> And what time</i> <i>was that?</i>

27:27.840 --> 27:29.920
ANNA:<i> Ten, maybe a few</i> <i>minutes afterwards.</i>

27:34.520 --> 27:36.360
<i>Paul was waiting for me.</i>

27:38.040 --> 27:40.720
I know that it was a stupid thing to do,

27:40.760 --> 27:45.240
but Paul can be a very determined man and that

27:40.760 --> 27:45.240
can be hard to resist.

27:47.800 --> 27:49.160
Aren't you going to get that?

27:49.200 --> 27:53.720
No, no, it's fine. That's not important.

27:53.760 --> 27:56.200
Look, Paul and I spent the entire night together.

27:56.240 --> 27:58.600
There is no way he could have killed anyone.

27:58.640 --> 28:01.880
And career or no career, if I have to, I will swear

27:58.640 --> 28:01.880
to that in court.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.200
So am I in the clear?

28:11.240 --> 28:12.960
Dr Jones has confirmed your alibi.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.800
So when can I have my passport back?

28:14.840 --> 28:18.080
All papers will be returned the moment the case

28:14.840 --> 28:18.080
is officially closed.

28:18.120 --> 28:19.280
But if I'm no longer a suspect...

28:19.320 --> 28:21.640
Hey, she backed you up. She didn't have to.

28:21.680 --> 28:22.960
Tyre pas trop sur la corde. Don't push your luck.

28:42.360 --> 28:43.560
Oh!

29:20.480 --> 29:23.240
RICHARD: The pot was moved, damaged in the process

29:23.280 --> 29:27.120
then put back in the wrong place, leaving a ring.

29:27.160 --> 29:29.400
Now, you've seen the clinic, it's spotless.

29:29.440 --> 29:33.960
So the cleaner would have cleaned the ring on the floor

29:29.440 --> 29:33.960
during the daily round.

29:34.000 --> 29:38.360
So we can infer the damage was done the previous night.

29:38.400 --> 29:42.400
-We know there wasn't

29:38.400 --> 29:42.400
a struggle, she had no injuries.

29:42.440 --> 29:45.400
What if she knocked it on the way to the pool?

29:45.440 --> 29:48.160
A suicidal woman carefully replaces a damaged pot

29:48.200 --> 29:51.400
before lowering herself silently into the water?

29:51.440 --> 29:54.840
Now, the tea. The tea has to hold the key.

29:54.880 --> 29:58.600
If it didn't poison her, why prepare it and only

29:54.880 --> 29:58.600
drink half a cup?

29:58.640 --> 30:01.040
She was disturbed. By her killer.

30:01.080 --> 30:04.600
Carlton Reynolds was the last person to see her.

30:04.640 --> 30:07.920
-Yes, it's here.

30:07.960 --> 30:09.920
She saw Carlton last night, didn't she?

30:09.960 --> 30:13.840
Yes. She said it was past ten.

30:13.880 --> 30:17.400
Yes, but he told us he went home around 9.30.

30:17.440 --> 30:20.560
Which gives him 30 minutes to have murdered Valerie Dupree.

30:26.760 --> 30:28.640
Come. Let's see where he's off to.

30:28.680 --> 30:30.200
But the inspector said to bring him in.

30:30.240 --> 30:32.800
Ah, it's called initiative.

30:32.840 --> 30:36.440
Yeah, it's also called disobeying a direct order

30:32.840 --> 30:36.440
from a senior officer.

30:36.480 --> 30:38.640
Dwayne, and now he's getting away, look.

30:40.720 --> 30:42.400
Come on, baby.

30:44.360 --> 30:46.600
Ah, good girl.

31:06.160 --> 31:08.040
FIDEL: What's he doing? DWAYNE: I don't know.

31:13.280 --> 31:15.160
You know there's absolutely no point in running.

31:18.760 --> 31:20.120
Hey!

31:21.640 --> 31:24.160
You see that? Watch and learn.

31:30.960 --> 31:34.280
That's the fourth time you've tested that tea.

31:34.320 --> 31:35.880
One can't be too thorough, sergeant.

31:39.280 --> 31:40.320
CAMILLE: Fidel.

31:43.880 --> 31:45.040
He hit me.

31:48.360 --> 31:52.120
It's a free clinic. No-one pays a penny.

31:52.160 --> 31:54.320
I only take what's about to expire,

31:54.360 --> 31:57.080
half-opened boxes, ready to be disposed of.

31:57.120 --> 32:00.760
Perfectly good medication thrown away? It's crazy.

32:00.800 --> 32:04.040
So when you told us you left the clinic at 9.30?

32:04.080 --> 32:05.920
I stop off at the pharmacy.

32:05.960 --> 32:08.400
<i>I just take a few</i> <i>things each time.</i>

32:08.440 --> 32:10.680
That way, no-one notices.

32:10.720 --> 32:14.280
When I have enough, I advertise a clinic.

32:14.320 --> 32:17.280
It's mostly women, children, mothers.

32:17.320 --> 32:21.000
People who need help but can't afford the doctor's bills.

32:21.040 --> 32:26.040
So you've been running an unlicensed clinic

32:21.040 --> 32:26.040
with stolen medication?

32:27.840 --> 32:29.400
Why run, then?

32:29.440 --> 32:31.240
You assaulted a police officer.

32:31.280 --> 32:33.520
CARLTON: I thought Dr Jones had sent you.

32:33.560 --> 32:36.320
I guess I just reacted.

32:36.360 --> 32:38.040
I'm sorry about your nose.

32:38.080 --> 32:41.000
I'd be happy to take a look at it?

32:41.040 --> 32:43.760
What's your relationship with Valerie Dupree?

32:43.800 --> 32:45.560
I was her nurse.

32:45.600 --> 32:48.400
When Mrs Dupree arrived, she was heartbroken.

32:48.440 --> 32:50.400
She just wanted to talk.

32:50.440 --> 32:52.080
Her husband had had an affair.

32:53.000 --> 32:54.080
A younger woman.

32:55.600 --> 32:58.440
She panicked, ran out and arranged to have surgery.

32:58.480 --> 33:00.800
But now she was here, nothing had changed.

33:02.640 --> 33:05.560
She was scared and lonely.

33:06.680 --> 33:08.240
I listened to her. That's all. You say Valerie was scared.

33:11.880 --> 33:15.360
That sounds like an unusual emotion.

33:15.400 --> 33:18.360
Her world had just caved in around her.

33:18.400 --> 33:19.960
Her husband doesn't love her.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.560
No children, friends taking sides

33:22.600 --> 33:25.360
and now a face she don't even recognise.

33:25.400 --> 33:27.800
Wouldn't you be afraid to face the world again?

33:27.840 --> 33:30.080
You think she was unhappy with her surgery?

33:30.120 --> 33:31.800
I know she was.

33:31.840 --> 33:33.960
She had already contacted her lawyer.

33:36.160 --> 33:40.880
Listen, that night, when I was with her,

33:40.920 --> 33:42.640
I knew she wanted to talk,

33:43.480 --> 33:45.400
wanted someone to listen.

33:45.440 --> 33:46.440
But I was tired.

33:47.560 --> 33:49.000
It'd been a long day.

33:50.200 --> 33:51.560
So I walked away.

33:53.720 --> 33:55.440
I could have helped her

33:55.480 --> 33:57.480
and I just walked away.

33:57.520 --> 34:00.640
And that's something I have got to live with

33:57.520 --> 34:00.640
for the rest of my life.

34:03.760 --> 34:05.560
Thank you. You've been most helpful.

34:07.080 --> 34:08.680
I think we have all we need here.

34:09.440 --> 34:11.480
So am I free to go?

34:11.520 --> 34:14.160
Unless Officer Best wishes to make a complaint?

34:16.720 --> 34:18.120
I guess we both made a mistake.

34:20.080 --> 34:21.120
Thank you.

34:24.960 --> 34:28.560
Dwayne, see that nurse Reynolds gets his property back.

34:34.360 --> 34:35.360
Sir.

34:36.640 --> 34:38.160
The phone company.

34:38.200 --> 34:41.360
Yes. Valerie Dupree made three phone calls

34:38.200 --> 34:41.360
on the day she died.

34:41.400 --> 34:42.800
All to the same number in Paris.

34:42.840 --> 34:45.400
I just checked it out. It was a French lawyer.

34:45.440 --> 34:48.200
She was going to make a complaint about the clinic.

34:48.240 --> 34:50.240
I think we may have found our motive.

34:53.520 --> 34:56.040
Sorry, sorry. I was held up in surgery.

34:56.080 --> 34:58.920
Well, I assume your presence here means

34:56.080 --> 34:58.920
we're making progress?

34:58.960 --> 35:00.600
Possibly.

35:00.640 --> 35:02.920
Did you know that Valerie Dupree

35:00.640 --> 35:02.920
made three calls

35:02.960 --> 35:06.400
to a firm of personal injury lawyers the same day she died?

35:07.320 --> 35:08.320
Please.

35:12.840 --> 35:16.600
You're implying I murdered her because she threatened legal

35:12.840 --> 35:16.600
action against my clinic?

35:16.640 --> 35:19.240
People have been killed for less.

35:19.280 --> 35:23.600
Do you recognise the name of this lawyer?

35:23.640 --> 35:26.080
No, I've never heard of him.

35:26.120 --> 35:30.680
Good, because that's my shopping list,

35:26.120 --> 35:30.680
it says bananas and sun block.

35:30.720 --> 35:32.760
Your eyesight's failing, isn't it, Mr Tipping?

35:32.800 --> 35:35.800
Why else would you keep complaining about

35:32.800 --> 35:35.800
the light in the theatre?

35:35.840 --> 35:37.320
Yet if you were just short sighted,

35:37.360 --> 35:39.560
why not wear glasses or contact lenses?

35:39.600 --> 35:44.280
It all suggests to me this is more than a simple

35:39.600 --> 35:44.280
refractive problem.

35:46.800 --> 35:48.400
It started about a year ago.

35:48.440 --> 35:51.800
I thought it was just old age, that I needed glasses. But...

35:53.720 --> 35:55.600
...things got worse.

35:55.640 --> 35:59.560
In the end, I got on a plane and went to see an old colleague

35:55.640 --> 35:59.560
back at Moorfields.

35:59.600 --> 36:01.400
Turns out I'm a bit of a rarity.

36:02.280 --> 36:04.880
I have retinitis pigmentosa.

36:04.920 --> 36:08.240
The sight fades, day by day.

36:08.280 --> 36:10.640
I think the word he used was inexorable.

36:12.080 --> 36:13.600
There is no treatment.

36:13.640 --> 36:15.200
I'll end up blind.

36:15.240 --> 36:17.800
And yet you continue to operate?

36:17.840 --> 36:20.000
Well, what I do here isn't real surgery.

36:20.040 --> 36:23.400
Besides, most of the procedures I could do with my bloody eyes

36:20.040 --> 36:23.400
closed anyway.

36:24.720 --> 36:25.760
Look, Inspector...

36:27.880 --> 36:29.720
I'm a surgeon, this...

36:32.120 --> 36:33.680
...is my life.

36:33.720 --> 36:35.120
I thought I could cope,

36:35.160 --> 36:38.080
that I had another maybe 12 months.

36:39.360 --> 36:40.400
But...

36:42.040 --> 36:45.640
Valerie Dupree's face simply wasn't up to snuff.

36:45.680 --> 36:48.640
Her scars were going to be visible, she had every right

36:45.680 --> 36:48.640
to complain.

36:49.520 --> 36:51.200
But I never...

36:51.240 --> 36:55.480
I never imagined that it would make her take her own life.

36:55.520 --> 36:57.880
You still believe she committed suicide?

36:57.920 --> 37:00.480
Yes, I do. I'm not proud of what happened, Inspector.

37:00.520 --> 37:02.760
I'm prepared to take my share of the blame.

37:02.800 --> 37:05.040
I shouldn't have operated on her.

37:05.080 --> 37:06.560
But that doesn't make me a murderer.

37:21.240 --> 37:22.320
Morning, Chief.

37:38.240 --> 37:39.240
Anything?

37:47.520 --> 37:48.760
Honore police station.

37:49.880 --> 37:51.880
Ah, yes, hold on one moment, please.

37:51.920 --> 37:54.320
Sir, it's the Commissioner.

37:56.520 --> 38:00.280
He says your 24 hours are up, we need to return the passports

37:56.520 --> 38:00.280
to the clinic guests.

38:11.240 --> 38:12.760
So that's it, I can go?

38:12.800 --> 38:16.000
That's it. You can get back to running your floral empire.

38:16.040 --> 38:20.520
-Yes, I can. -You never mentioned

38:16.040 --> 38:20.520
you were born on Saint Marie.

38:20.560 --> 38:23.520
I read your paper, it says you were born here in Honore.

38:23.560 --> 38:28.280
Sure. My parents moved off the island when I was ten. So...

38:28.320 --> 38:31.880
When I saw the clinic was here, I had to give them a call.

38:31.920 --> 38:33.120
You can't fight fate.

38:34.960 --> 38:36.000
I got to go.

38:48.240 --> 38:50.520
I just thought it was strange, that's all.

38:50.560 --> 38:53.400
When I was at the clinic earlier, I spoke

38:50.560 --> 38:53.400
to him in French.

38:53.440 --> 38:57.000
At the time, I thought he just hadn't heard me, but how is it

38:53.440 --> 38:57.000
that someone

38:57.040 --> 38:59.800
who'd have gone to school here doesn't know a word of French?

38:59.840 --> 39:03.640
Well, I know plenty of people who went to school in England

38:59.840 --> 39:03.640
who can't speak English.

39:03.680 --> 39:07.800
Mama, do you remember a boy called Paul Vincent?

39:09.240 --> 39:12.520
Late 1970s, local family.

39:12.560 --> 39:16.560
No. I knew the Vincent family, but they had two girls.

39:16.600 --> 39:20.080
No, wait, they had a son who died very young.

39:20.120 --> 39:21.760
It was so sad.

39:21.800 --> 39:24.080
I think his name was Paul.

39:24.120 --> 39:25.600
But maybe I'm wrong.

39:26.880 --> 39:28.080
FIDEL: Miss Smythe looks happy.

39:30.120 --> 39:32.880
How do you know? She can't smile.

39:32.920 --> 39:34.400
In fact, she's had so much work done,

39:34.440 --> 39:35.880
I'm surprised she can move a muscle.

39:43.040 --> 39:45.040
She didn't drink it because she couldn't drink it.

39:45.080 --> 39:48.040
The answer's been staring me in the face. Quite literally.

39:48.080 --> 39:50.560
ANNA:<i> Our clientele are rich,</i> <i>important people.</i>

39:50.600 --> 39:51.720
Yes?

39:51.760 --> 39:55.000
<i>They insist</i> <i>on total discretion.</i>

39:55.040 --> 39:57.520
<i>This is a business first</i> <i>and a hospital second.</i>

40:01.120 --> 40:04.240
-Fidel, I need a list of all the clients in the clinic.

40:01.120 --> 40:04.240
-You've had it, sir. Not the ones there now, well,

40:04.280 --> 40:07.400
those too, but going back, say, two years.

40:07.440 --> 40:09.600
And cross-check with the immigration records,

40:09.640 --> 40:11.600
when they arrived in Saint Marie and when they left.

40:11.640 --> 40:14.160
Dwayne, get everyone together, Commissioner included.

40:14.200 --> 40:16.360
I'll be at the clinic in an hour.

40:18.680 --> 40:21.960
The public records office and then the graveyard,

40:18.680 --> 40:21.960
obviously.

40:23.320 --> 40:24.400
Bye.

40:41.600 --> 40:43.120
Chief!

40:43.160 --> 40:45.040
Paul Vincent has left the clinic.

40:45.080 --> 40:48.560
Cab driver said he's gone down to the marina. Come!

40:49.040 --> 40:50.600
Toss a coin?

40:50.640 --> 40:53.000
No way, it plays havoc with my hair.

41:04.280 --> 41:05.320
Whoa!

41:11.240 --> 41:12.320
That way!

41:29.480 --> 41:32.200
Dwayne! Dwayne!

41:55.760 --> 41:56.960
Not on my watch.

42:02.600 --> 42:03.720
Aargh!

42:11.440 --> 42:13.440
I honestly didn't expect that to work.

42:25.840 --> 42:27.680
This had better be good.

42:27.720 --> 42:30.480
No. It had better astound me.

42:38.200 --> 42:43.360
I've called you all here because Valerie Dupree

42:44.080 --> 42:47.400
did not commit suicide.

42:47.440 --> 42:53.720
Every murder investigation has to focus on three things,

42:47.440 --> 42:53.720
means, motive and opportunity.

42:53.760 --> 42:56.120
Usually those things all point towards one person.

42:56.160 --> 42:59.240
However, in this case, only nurse Carlton Reynolds,

42:59.280 --> 43:03.960
the last person to see the victim alive seems to

42:59.280 --> 43:03.960
have the opportunity.

43:04.000 --> 43:07.240
On the night of the murder, you thought she wanted

43:04.000 --> 43:07.240
to tell you something.

43:07.280 --> 43:09.760
You said she seemed frightened, wanted to leave the clinic.

43:10.160 --> 43:11.400
Yes.

43:11.440 --> 43:15.000
You assumed it was fear of the future, however,

43:15.040 --> 43:17.520
I now believe she was afraid for her life.

43:19.000 --> 43:23.760
The Jacaranda Clinic prides itself on absolute discretion.

43:24.640 --> 43:27.280
Clients quietly come and go.

43:29.640 --> 43:31.400
As Sergeant Bordey said,

43:31.440 --> 43:34.120
it's like they've never actually been here at all.

43:35.560 --> 43:38.040
And that's the whole point, isn't it, Dr Jones?

43:41.400 --> 43:42.680
Please, can I have your phone?

43:48.400 --> 43:49.520
Thank you.

43:50.520 --> 43:51.600
And the other one?

44:01.320 --> 44:05.320
I thought having two phones was strange, but I dismissed it.

44:05.360 --> 44:07.440
That was a mistake.

44:07.480 --> 44:11.320
Because once I realised that the white one

44:07.480 --> 44:11.320
was for the legitimate clinic

44:11.360 --> 44:14.160
and the black one was for some kind of illegal operation...

44:14.200 --> 44:15.280
Yes.

44:15.320 --> 44:16.960
...everything started to fit together.

44:17.840 --> 44:22.400
White for good, black for bad.

44:22.440 --> 44:26.120
Your own private joke at everyone else's expense.

44:26.160 --> 44:29.880
Because it's essential you know exactly who's

44:26.160 --> 44:29.880
ringing you, isn't it?

44:32.960 --> 44:36.360
You told me that the clinic was losing money

44:32.960 --> 44:36.360
until Dr Jones arrived.

44:36.400 --> 44:41.280
You explained how she'd turned the place around

44:36.400 --> 44:41.280
with a new marketing strategy.

44:41.320 --> 44:44.120
You didn't restructure the existing business

44:41.320 --> 44:44.120
at all, did you?

44:44.160 --> 44:47.080
You simply used it as cover for another one.

44:47.120 --> 44:49.760
Helping criminals begin new lives.

44:49.800 --> 44:52.280
By finding someone of a similar age to them

44:52.320 --> 44:54.640
who died young and stealing their details.

44:54.680 --> 44:58.760
You provided new faces and new identities.

44:58.800 --> 45:00.680
St Marie is the perfect location.

45:00.720 --> 45:02.480
No electronic records

45:02.520 --> 45:06.960
means it's almost impossible for police and borders

45:02.520 --> 45:06.960
to cross-check.

45:07.000 --> 45:10.160
You know, I have absolutely no idea who this gentleman is,

45:10.200 --> 45:13.480
but I do know he is not Paul Vincent.

45:13.520 --> 45:17.280
The real Paul Vincent died over 35 years ago

45:13.520 --> 45:17.280
as a small child.

45:17.320 --> 45:20.160
Absolute rot! Selwyn?

45:20.200 --> 45:21.760
Carry on, Inspector.

45:21.800 --> 45:24.600
You can't make these allegations without proof!

45:25.640 --> 45:27.360
Records.

45:27.400 --> 45:30.000
Of clients who have stayed at the clinic over

45:27.400 --> 45:30.000
the past two years.

45:30.040 --> 45:35.240
Among them, you'll find 18 people also

45:30.040 --> 45:35.240
recorded as deceased.

45:35.280 --> 45:38.760
I understand your medical prowess may be on the wane,

45:38.800 --> 45:42.800
but even in your heyday, I doubt you could resurrect the dead.

45:42.840 --> 45:49.000
No, the clinic was being used as a one-stop shop

45:42.840 --> 45:49.000
for identity theft

45:49.040 --> 45:53.200
with the occasional spot of cosmetic surgery

45:49.040 --> 45:53.200
when needed,

45:53.240 --> 45:56.040
as in Mr Vincent's case, to finish the job.

45:56.080 --> 46:00.480
All run by Dr Jones, under everyone's nose.

46:00.520 --> 46:04.600
We've already established Valerie Dupree was frightened

46:00.520 --> 46:04.600
the night that she died.

46:04.640 --> 46:07.320
We also have a witness who saw her clearly uncomfortable

46:07.360 --> 46:10.280
in the presence of the man we know as Paul Vincent.

46:10.320 --> 46:13.800
JAYNE:<i> I think they were having</i> <i>some kind of lover's tiff.</i>

46:13.840 --> 46:16.800
RICHARD: Things weren't quite as they seemed.

46:16.840 --> 46:19.840
I now believe Valerie Dupree had somehow discovered

46:19.880 --> 46:24.720
the truth behind what Dr Jones and her special

46:19.880 --> 46:24.720
clients were up to.

46:24.760 --> 46:28.320
She was, in fact, petrified of Mr Vincent.

46:28.360 --> 46:32.640
So he's the murderer

46:32.680 --> 46:34.360
This man is undoubtedly a criminal,

46:34.400 --> 46:37.040
but he is not, as far as I'm aware, a murderer.

46:37.840 --> 46:39.600
Then who is?

46:39.640 --> 46:43.520
Valerie Dupree's life was taken by the only person who had

46:39.640 --> 46:43.520
the opportunity.

46:43.560 --> 46:44.680
Carlton Reynolds.

46:44.720 --> 46:46.840
No! I swear!

46:46.880 --> 46:48.240
I didn't do it!

46:50.840 --> 46:54.760
The first thing that bothered me about this case

46:50.840 --> 46:54.760
was a simple cup of tea.

46:54.800 --> 46:59.680
Why go to the trouble of making an expensive pot of tea

46:54.800 --> 46:59.680
yet fail to drink it?

46:59.720 --> 47:01.360
Unless you were disturbed.

47:02.600 --> 47:04.880
In this case, by their killer.

47:04.920 --> 47:09.600
Valerie Dupree was killed by the most powerful toxin

47:04.920 --> 47:09.600
known to man,

47:09.640 --> 47:12.120
a substance this clinic uses every day,

47:12.160 --> 47:15.360
yet which no lab would ever find unless they

47:12.160 --> 47:15.360
were looking for it,

47:15.400 --> 47:17.280
botulinum toxin.

47:17.320 --> 47:20.400
Harmless enough when used to remove wrinkles,

47:20.440 --> 47:23.040
yet fatal in the hands of a killer.

47:23.080 --> 47:26.920
<i>Administered unwittingly</i> <i>by Carlton Reynolds...</i>

47:30.320 --> 47:34.080
...but prepared very deliberately

47:30.320 --> 47:34.080
by Dr Anna Jones.

47:40.160 --> 47:44.440
You waited for the moment that Valerie's Heparin injection

47:40.160 --> 47:44.440
was ready to be administered

47:44.480 --> 47:48.280
and then you swapped it for a massive overdose

47:44.480 --> 47:48.280
of botulinum toxin.

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
<i>Carlton continued his rounds,</i>

47:52.040 --> 47:55.920
<i>not knowing he was now carrying</i> <i>a lethal syringe.</i>

47:55.960 --> 47:58.760
RICHARD: What happened

47:58.800 --> 48:02.280
Perhaps to tell you she had called her lawyer

47:58.800 --> 48:02.280
and was going to complain?

48:02.320 --> 48:04.880
Whatever she was planning, she never got that far, did she?

48:04.920 --> 48:10.920
Instead, I think she overheard exactly what was going on

48:04.920 --> 48:10.920
at the Jacaranda.

48:10.960 --> 48:15.200
An illegal identity fraud racket involving some

48:10.960 --> 48:15.200
very unpleasant people.

48:17.040 --> 48:19.040
You knew you had to silence her.

48:19.080 --> 48:21.400
And that what you'd added to her medication would paralyse

48:21.440 --> 48:24.960
every muscle in Valerie Dupree's body within minutes.

48:25.000 --> 48:28.360
<i>With her lungs paralysed</i> <i>and unable to breathe,</i>

48:28.400 --> 48:31.200
<i>Valerie died in her own bed.</i>

48:31.240 --> 48:36.840
You then simply moved her, silent and unseen, on a trolley

48:31.240 --> 48:36.840
like any other patient.

48:36.880 --> 48:41.320
Yet the trolley had a bent wheel, making

48:36.880 --> 48:41.320
it difficult to manoeuvre.

48:41.360 --> 48:46.360
Which was why you knocked into a terracotta

48:41.360 --> 48:46.360
plant pot by the pool.

48:47.800 --> 48:51.480
<i>Then you slid the body</i> <i>of Valerie Dupree into the pool</i>

48:51.520 --> 48:54.480
<i>to make it look like</i> <i>she'd drowned herself.</i>

48:59.360 --> 49:03.280
All so that your criminal endeavours weren't exposed.

49:03.320 --> 49:05.880
Valerie felt she'd lost her beauty as well as her husband,

49:05.920 --> 49:08.080
but you took away the most precious thing of all,

49:08.680 --> 49:09.680
her life.

49:12.160 --> 49:13.240
Lock her up.

49:25.360 --> 49:28.120
My dear fellow, it seems I may have

49:25.360 --> 49:28.120
been a little harsh

49:28.160 --> 49:30.280
on the phone the other day.

49:30.320 --> 49:32.680
What can I do to make it up to you?

49:40.600 --> 49:42.240
Oh.

49:49.760 --> 49:54.880
It seems our mysterious Mr Vincent's real name

49:49.760 --> 49:54.880
is Emilio Suarez.

49:54.920 --> 49:59.240
Big time drug runner. Wanted in Florida

49:54.920 --> 49:59.240
and five other states.

49:59.280 --> 50:01.200
With a bit of luck, they'll throw away the key.

50:01.240 --> 50:04.120
I couldn't agree more. Anything else come in?

50:04.160 --> 50:07.000
Nothing. It's still quiet.

50:07.040 --> 50:12.440
Right, well, in that case, I suppose we should just,

50:07.040 --> 50:12.440
you know, lime?

50:12.480 --> 50:15.440
Fidel. You're in the hot seat.

50:15.480 --> 50:19.000
Professor Plum, in the dining room,

50:15.480 --> 50:19.000
with the lead piping?

50:19.720 --> 50:21.080
Is that wrong?

50:21.120 --> 50:23.080
I think we've established Professor Plum

50:23.120 --> 50:25.760
was nowhere near the piping, lead or otherwise.

50:25.800 --> 50:27.200
Okay. Dwayne?

50:27.240 --> 50:30.440
This is it

50:30.480 --> 50:32.480
Okay, another pass. Camille?

50:32.520 --> 50:34.600
Can we please play something else?

50:34.640 --> 50:35.920
Like what?

50:35.960 --> 50:39.360
I don't know. Twister?

50:39.400 --> 50:40.480
Hide and seek?

50:40.520 --> 50:41.840
Don't be so childish. Come on.

50:42.400 --> 50:43.480
Right.

50:44.360 --> 50:46.240
-No.

50:46.280 --> 50:49.320
Miss Scarlet. I told you, you can't keep shouting

50:46.280 --> 50:49.320
out names,

50:49.360 --> 50:50.560
it doesn't work like that.

50:50.600 --> 50:52.440
Reverend Green. -No!

50:52.480 --> 50:54.000
Well, one of them must be right!

50:54.040 --> 50:55.680
Yes, but that's hardly the point, is it?

50:55.720 --> 50:58.040
-No.

50:59.600 --> 51:01.400
DWAYNE: This is the game

51:05.440 --> 51:09.440
Ah. Jayne Smythe looks ten years younger.

51:09.480 --> 51:11.400
Amazing what love can do.

51:11.440 --> 51:12.760
This is it?

51:12.800 --> 51:14.560
Sergeant Bordey, I'm going to count down from five

51:14.600 --> 51:18.240
and then, by the officially ratified Poole family

51:14.600 --> 51:18.240
rules of Cluedo,

51:18.280 --> 51:19.560
you miss your turn.

51:19.600 --> 51:21.440
Five, four...

51:21.480 --> 51:25.200
You should try it you know, love.

51:25.240 --> 51:28.040
-All I'm saying is...

51:28.080 --> 51:30.240
RICHARD: Right. Fine, you win. Game over.
