OLDER TED: You know how Aunt Robin's
a big fan of Halloween?

00:18.485 --> 00:20.578
Always dressing up in crazy costumes?

00:21.154 --> 00:22.883
Well, she wasn't always that way.

00:22.989 --> 00:25.389
Back in 2005, she thought she was
too cool for Halloween.

00:26.793 --> 00:28.226
<i>Unlike Aunt Lily,</i>

00:28.962 --> 00:31.522
- Guess what came in the mail today?
- Our costumes?

00:31.631 --> 00:33.189
- Do they rule?
- They rule.

00:33.299 --> 00:34.766
And yours is 100% wool,

00:34.868 --> 00:37.735
so you won't get hypothermia
like last year.

00:37.937 --> 00:40.269
Tarzan nipple blue.

00:41.474 --> 00:42.736
You know what I love about Halloween?

00:42.842 --> 00:46.710
It's the one night of the year chicks use
to unleash their inner ho-bag.

00:47.213 --> 00:50.011
If a girl dresses up as a witch,
she's a slutty witch.

00:50.150 --> 00:52.641
If she's a cat, she's a slutty cat.

00:53.053 --> 00:55.578
- Lf she's a nurse...
- Wow. We get it.

00:56.523 --> 00:58.491
She's a slutty nurse.

00:58.858 --> 01:00.120
Robin, what are you doing for Halloween?

01:00.226 --> 01:01.523
Oh, I don't know.

01:01.628 --> 01:04.119
Probably hanging out with Mike,
this guy I've been seeing.

01:04.230 --> 01:06.130
Mike? There's a Mike?

01:06.232 --> 01:08.325
You have a boyfriend
and you haven't told us?

01:08.435 --> 01:09.629
No. I mean, he's not my boyfriend.

01:09.736 --> 01:12.762
He's just this guy I've been seeing
for a couple of weeks.

01:12.872 --> 01:13.839
Boyfriend.

01:13.940 --> 01:15.407
So why haven't we met him?

01:15.508 --> 01:18.136
We're not really ready to go public yet.

01:18.244 --> 01:19.734
Married.

01:20.880 --> 01:22.905
How about we go
on a Halloween double-date?

01:23.016 --> 01:24.984
I don't know, we were kind of thinking
about staying at home

01:25.085 --> 01:27.383
and dressing up as naked people.

01:28.688 --> 01:30.918
Come on, Robin, trot out your new fella.

01:31.024 --> 01:33.151
Let us judge and evaluate him
behind your back.

01:33.259 --> 01:34.692
It'll be fun.

01:35.595 --> 01:36.960
Hey, Ted, you'll never guess
what happened?

01:37.063 --> 01:39.156
- Your costumes came?
- Our costumes... Yes.

01:39.265 --> 01:41.529
That is why we're best friends.

01:41.701 --> 01:43.225
Hey, Ted,
what are you doing for Halloween?

01:43.336 --> 01:45.167
- Well...
- What?

01:45.472 --> 01:48.168
Every Halloween,
Ted waits for the slutty pumpkin.

01:48.274 --> 01:49.241
That's right.

01:49.342 --> 01:50.468
What's the slutty pumpkin?

01:50.577 --> 01:52.943
You mean, "Who is the slutty pumpkin?"

01:53.079 --> 01:54.774
It was four years ago.

01:55.148 --> 01:57.412
<i>TED; I was at this Halloween party</i>
<i>up on the roof of our building,</i>

01:57.517 --> 01:59.849
<i>about to call it an early night,</i>
<i>when out of nowhere</i>

01:59.953 --> 02:03.150
<i>appeared this girl</i>
<i>in the sexiest pumpkin costume,</i>

02:04.190 --> 02:06.886
Wait, how can a pumpkin costume
be sexy?

02:07.060 --> 02:09.324
It was carved in strategic places.

02:09.996 --> 02:12.430
<i>TED; So, we're at the bar and I see her mix</i>

02:12.532 --> 02:14.124
- Kahlúa and...
- Kahlúa and root beer.

02:14.234 --> 02:15.963
A cocktail she invented herself.

02:16.069 --> 02:17.900
- And she...
- And she called it the Tootsie Roll.

02:18.004 --> 02:18.993
- Because...
- ALL: Because it tastes

02:19.105 --> 02:20.504
like an alcoholic Tootsie Roll.

02:20.607 --> 02:22.905
Hey, can I please tell the story?

02:23.009 --> 02:24.738
So we had this instant connection.

02:24.844 --> 02:26.436
She gave me her number. But then...

02:26.546 --> 02:28.241
ALL: Something went terribly wrong.

02:28.348 --> 02:29.406
Guys!

02:30.617 --> 02:32.141
Something went terribly wrong.

02:33.052 --> 02:34.610
Happy Halloween.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.384
Sonny, where's Cher?

02:37.490 --> 02:39.685
- Cher.
- Right here, babe.

02:41.895 --> 02:43.624
I just met the perfect woman.

02:43.730 --> 02:47.131
She's funny, she's beautiful,
she loves <i>Star Wars,</i>

02:47.233 --> 02:49.133
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's her take on Ewoks?

02:49.235 --> 02:50.759
- Loves them.
- Oh, good.

02:50.870 --> 02:52.735
I don't know why people
are so cynical about Ewoks.

02:52.839 --> 02:55.307
The Rebellion would've failed
without the Ewoks.

02:55.441 --> 02:56.931
And get this. She's a marine biologist.

02:57.043 --> 02:58.977
She spent a year in Antarctica
studying penguins.

02:59.078 --> 03:00.477
Oh, penguins are cool.

03:00.580 --> 03:03.276
Kind of like black-and-white Ewoks.
I approve.

03:04.150 --> 03:06.380
Hey, where's my Kit Kat?
I put it right here on this table.

03:06.486 --> 03:08.477
I don't know,
but we have plenty of chocolate here.

03:08.588 --> 03:10.920
No, no, no, you don't understand.
I need that Kit Kat.

03:11.024 --> 03:13.254
She wrote her number on that wrapper.
Where is it?

03:13.359 --> 03:14.326
Uh-oh.

03:16.696 --> 03:19.426
Hey, Dracula, come on. Give me the candy.
Give me it!

03:23.102 --> 03:26.003
Where's the Kit Kat? Where's the Kit Kat?

03:26.973 --> 03:29.669
Never found her number.
Never saw her again.

03:29.809 --> 03:31.401
But every year
they have a Halloween party

03:31.511 --> 03:33.445
up on the roof, so that's where I'll be.

03:33.546 --> 03:35.275
You know, Ted, it's been four years.

03:35.381 --> 03:37.645
She could be engaged, or married,

03:37.750 --> 03:40.275
or, God forbid, fat.

03:41.788 --> 03:43.255
I don't know, I got a feeling.

03:43.356 --> 03:44.482
This could be the year.

03:44.591 --> 03:46.957
Halloween is a night of wonder and magic.

03:47.994 --> 03:50.258
All right, bring the mockery.
Fine. I can take it.

03:50.363 --> 03:51.853
Come on,
wouldn't it be the coolest story ever

03:51.965 --> 03:54.763
if the slutty pumpkin turned out
to be my future wife?

03:55.768 --> 03:57.929
Oh, on the off chance that
that could happen,

03:58.037 --> 04:00.972
maybe we should stop calling her
the slutty pumpkin.

04:02.141 --> 04:03.165
Good idea.

04:33.539 --> 04:34.665
$100.

What are you going as?
Oh, like I even need to ask.

04:42.415 --> 04:44.440
Hey, I want the slutty pumpkin
to recognize me,

04:44.550 --> 04:47.519
and she knows me as a hanging chad.

04:48.888 --> 04:50.321
What? She thought it was hilarious.

04:50.423 --> 04:51.822
Yeah, four years ago.

04:51.924 --> 04:55.087
But nobody remembers
what the hell a hanging chad is.

04:55.194 --> 04:57.890

on our national attention span,

in our political history.

Do you like Mike?

11:08.167 --> 11:09.930
Of course I do. Why?

11:10.136 --> 11:11.694
It just doesn't seem like it.

11:11.804 --> 11:14.170
You won't share your food,
you won't wear a costume.

11:14.273 --> 11:17.868
Oh, Lily, you know me.
I'm just not into all that coupley stuff.

11:17.977 --> 11:21.037
Okay, I know that stuff
looks dumb from the outside.

11:21.514 --> 11:24.972
But it's kind of the greatest thing
in the world when you're a part of it.

11:25.084 --> 11:27.450
If you just gave it a chance,
you might like it.

you're gonna lose him.

for a night.

Okay. Well, what am I supposed to do?

11:44.036 --> 11:46.732
Buy him a giant teddy bear or something?

11:47.039 --> 11:49.906
How about you start by sharing dessert.

11:51.110 --> 11:52.407
I can share dessert.

11:52.511 --> 11:53.569
Good.

11:54.580 --> 11:56.377

in case I strike out
with the hottest girl at the party.
