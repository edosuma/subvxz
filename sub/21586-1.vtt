02:59.512 --> 03:00.680
Too late, called you first.

03:01.347 --> 03:02.307
Whoa.

03:02.807 --> 03:03.683
"Whoa"?

03:05.184 --> 03:06.185
What do you mean, whoa?

03:06.686 --> 03:07.645
Nothing.

03:07.937 --> 03:08.938
I meant, nothing.

03:09.564 --> 03:11.274
You said "whoa" when
you answered my call.

03:11.399 --> 03:15.278
I just, I didn't realize,
you just look super different.

03:15.904 --> 03:17.363
I hope that's a good thing.

03:17.447 --> 03:20.158
Yeah, I mean,
you're totally...

03:22.577 --> 03:23.620
You grew up too.

03:26.748 --> 03:28.249
What grade are you in?

03:28.416 --> 03:29.834
I'm in your grade, duh.

03:30.293 --> 03:31.127
Right.

03:31.210 --> 03:32.462
How'd you find me?

03:35.173 --> 03:37.008
I was just looking through...

03:37.300 --> 03:38.676
Are you stalking me?

03:39.427 --> 03:41.471
No, no, no, no,
I wasn't, I wasn't.

03:41.554 --> 03:42.513
I was just kidding!

03:43.306 --> 03:45.391
T, come on, let's
skip the awkwardness.

03:45.683 --> 03:46.559
What's your deal?

03:47.727 --> 03:48.645
My deal?

03:49.062 --> 03:50.313
Yeah, what's your deal?

03:51.648 --> 03:54.567
Well, I guess
I'm still stuck in Michigan,

03:54.651 --> 03:56.945
I hate school,
and my parents suck.

03:57.362 --> 03:59.280
That's true
for like everybody.

03:59.656 --> 04:01.157
Not everybody
lives in Michigan.

04:01.741 --> 04:02.575
Har har.

04:04.118 --> 04:05.703
So you still like comic books?

04:06.871 --> 04:07.705
Oh.

04:09.249 --> 04:10.917
Yeah, I guess I do.

04:11.042 --> 04:12.085
That's awesome.

04:12.919 --> 04:14.045
No, it is.

04:14.128 --> 04:15.046
I'm in choir.

04:15.546 --> 04:17.005
They wanted me to join
the school musical

04:17.089 --> 04:18.800
but you'd have
to be there like every night

04:18.882 --> 04:20.760
and I'm way too busy, so.

04:20.843 --> 04:22.428
My school's doing this
Bye Bye Birdie year.

04:22.512 --> 04:24.389
I was gonna
audition but then...

04:27.642 --> 04:28.601
What are you doing tonight?

04:30.061 --> 04:30.937
Nothing.

04:31.020 --> 04:32.855
Just probably
playing video games.

04:33.356 --> 04:34.357
Nothing?

04:34.440 --> 04:35.275
It's a Saturday night,

04:35.358 --> 04:36.651
you're not going out
with your friends?

04:37.860 --> 04:41.489
I would, but they
just...

04:42.865 --> 04:44.158
couldn't tonight.

04:44.867 --> 04:46.035
Come on,
T, shake it up.

04:46.119 --> 04:47.120
You gotta live a little.

04:47.203 --> 04:48.079
Yeah.

04:48.162 --> 04:50.331
I usually... I...

04:50.581 --> 04:52.083
Hey, T, you know
what, I gotta go.

04:52.166 --> 04:53.543
My friend's gonna
be here in like a minute

04:53.626 --> 04:55.837
and if I don't get downstairs,
my dad's gonna get to her

04:55.920 --> 04:57.672
and he gets all weird
and flirty, so...

04:57.839 --> 04:59.340
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

04:59.841 --> 05:02.552
Can we talk again sometime?

05:03.094 --> 05:05.221
I don't know,
I've got a killer schedule.

05:05.805 --> 05:06.973
Okay, totally.

05:08.641 --> 05:09.517
- You know, I was just thinking...
- -Hey, T, you know what?

05:10.560 --> 05:11.602
She's actually here,
I gotta go.

05:11.686 --> 05:12.520
Bye.

05:14.188 --> 05:15.023
Bye.

05:55.063 --> 05:55.980
Teel!

05:56.606 --> 05:57.648
Hi, Teel!

05:58.399 --> 05:59.484
This is Sophie.

05:59.567 --> 06:01.819
Oh, oh, no, Sophie, no.

06:01.903 --> 06:03.196
We ignore Sophie right now.

06:03.279 --> 06:05.031
No, don't ignore me!
Here, take a jello shot.

06:05.114 --> 06:06.532
Stop, stop, no.

06:06.616 --> 06:08.826
- Okay, you drink it then.
- No, Sophie, no.

06:08.910 --> 06:11.329
- They're nonalcoholic.
- Okay, fine.

06:11.412 --> 06:12.872
- I promise!
- Fine, okay.

06:12.955 --> 06:13.790
- I promise.
- Okay.

06:13.873 --> 06:16.709
Okay. Okay,
I'm putting this down.

06:17.877 --> 06:19.879
I thought that you
might be bored tonight

06:19.962 --> 06:22.507
so I brought you
to Becky's party.

06:22.590 --> 06:23.883
- Oh yeah.
- Looks like fun.

06:26.761 --> 06:27.595
What?

06:27.678 --> 06:28.846
Seems fun.

06:29.764 --> 06:32.058
Oh, we're gonna be here
until, like, super late.

06:33.184 --> 06:35.144
- Okay, so here's the deal.
- What?

06:35.228 --> 06:37.355
I've been flirting with Cole McCovey all night
but apparently he would rather play with Ella.

06:39.732 --> 06:41.734
Ping pong, of all things.

06:42.360 --> 06:43.486
What's ping pong?

06:43.569 --> 06:44.654
What?

06:44.737 --> 06:45.696
What's ping pong?

06:47.198 --> 06:49.283
Like, ping pong,
table tennis?

06:49.575 --> 06:50.576
You know, the game?

06:50.660 --> 06:52.703
Oh, you actually
mean, like, ping pong.

06:52.787 --> 06:54.956
Okay, so here's Cole.

06:56.874 --> 06:57.750
Isn't he cute?

06:57.834 --> 06:59.210
- I guess.
- And here's Ella.

06:59.961 --> 07:02.755
I do not
like her at all.

07:03.673 --> 07:05.341
So I wanted Sophie's
help with this

07:05.424 --> 07:09.345
but she, as you can
see, is gone.

07:09.804 --> 07:11.681
So I turn to you, okay?

07:11.889 --> 07:12.849
See this guy over here?

07:14.225 --> 07:15.351
His name is John Dixon

07:15.685 --> 07:18.771
but we call him Dix because
he literally is, you know,

07:19.021 --> 07:20.106
- with that.
- Right.

07:20.314 --> 07:23.151
So if I can get him
to kiss me in front of Cole,

07:23.234 --> 07:25.278
maybe I can make Cole
jealous and have him want

07:25.361 --> 07:26.404
to play ping pong with me.

07:27.155 --> 07:28.072
What do you think?

07:28.156 --> 07:29.615
I... It doesn't sound
like the best...

07:29.699 --> 07:30.658
I'll take that as a yes.

07:30.783 --> 07:32.076
Okay, just wait here.

07:34.704 --> 07:35.705
Hey, Dix.

07:35.788 --> 07:36.747
Don't call me that.

07:36.831 --> 07:37.832
What you playing?

07:37.915 --> 07:38.833
What are you playing?

07:38.916 --> 07:40.293
Hey, I was just about
to beat my high score!

07:40.376 --> 07:41.919
Candy Crush.
High score?

07:42.628 --> 07:44.922
Would you rather score
on this or score with me?

07:45.131 --> 07:45.965
I...

07:59.228 --> 08:00.354
Whoa, hey.

08:00.730 --> 08:02.148
You guys, why don't
you get a room?

08:03.232 --> 08:05.067
Hey, hey, horndog!

08:06.402 --> 08:07.236
T!

08:07.320 --> 08:08.529
Get the hell off of her!

08:08.613 --> 08:10.114
You watching us,
you little perv?

08:10.198 --> 08:11.073
Hey!

08:11.199 --> 08:12.033
Stop!

08:13.576 --> 08:15.119
Oh, you are such a bitch!

08:15.203 --> 08:17.371
- Oh my god, oh my god!
- Whoa!

08:17.455 --> 08:18.331
Mad...

08:18.539 --> 08:19.749
- Mad.
- It did not go well.

08:26.255 --> 08:27.089
Sophie! Mad...

08:32.428 --> 08:33.888
Teel, hey!

08:34.138 --> 08:35.264
Take a look!

09:28.568 --> 09:29.443
Come on!

10:20.786 --> 10:22.163
T, I was supposed to call you.

10:22.246 --> 10:23.164
Are you okay?

10:23.247 --> 10:24.874
Yeah, the party was insane.

10:24.957 --> 10:26.751
That Dix guy is a dick.

10:26.834 --> 10:27.668
Right?

10:27.752 --> 10:29.253
Don't worry, my friends
pushed him into the pool too

10:29.337 --> 10:32.965
and he tried to dunk me, but
I was on the swim team, so...

10:33.341 --> 10:35.343
It was good because I had
beer all over my shirt,

10:35.426 --> 10:37.803
so I totally rinsed it out
and Cole came out to watch.

10:39.096 --> 10:40.765
I guess as long
as Cole was there.

10:41.098 --> 10:42.600
Isn't it like 4:30 your time?

10:43.142 --> 10:45.853
Yeah, but I'm up, so whatever.

10:46.187 --> 10:47.188
You're a night owl. Don't
you have a curfew?

10:49.982 --> 10:51.567
11:30.

10:52.234 --> 10:54.028
But my dad goes
to bed at, like, 10:00, so.

10:54.487 --> 10:55.696
He doesn't check up on you?

10:56.113 --> 10:56.989
No.

10:57.490 --> 10:58.324
He trusts me.

10:58.407 --> 10:59.450
I'm totally trustworthy.

10:59.575 --> 11:01.077
Yeah, I can see that.

11:01.952 --> 11:03.537
T, it's a party.

11:03.621 --> 11:05.373
It's all part of the fun,
you gotta loosen up

11:05.456 --> 11:06.457
if you want friends. I have friends.

11:09.251 --> 11:11.545
I have, like, tons of friends.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.923
I'm just saying, it doesn't
seem like you go out that much.

11:14.006 --> 11:15.883
No, my friends
and I go out all the time,

11:15.966 --> 11:16.926
they just couldn't tonight.

11:17.009 --> 11:18.052
Okay.

11:19.762 --> 11:21.806
Besides, you know, sometimes
I like having a night

11:21.889 --> 11:23.224
to myself every
once in a while.

11:23.307 --> 11:26.227
Sometimes it's nice to just
decompress, do some gaming,

11:26.435 --> 11:27.520
listen to some music.

11:28.604 --> 11:30.189
Yeah, no, I get it.

11:30.815 --> 11:31.649
I just...

11:32.608 --> 11:33.692
Wait, I think I hear my dad.

11:39.073 --> 11:40.116
Bye.

11:44.829 --> 11:46.205
My dad took my phone.

11:47.081 --> 11:48.124
What, why?

11:48.207 --> 11:49.208
I'm grounded for two weeks.

11:49.291 --> 11:51.043
He found out that
I missed curfew.

11:51.127 --> 11:52.086
How?

11:52.169 --> 11:53.879
He came in here,
like, at midnight

11:53.963 --> 11:55.798
and I guess I wasn't
in here, obviously.

11:56.090 --> 11:57.633
WTF, this is my room.

11:57.716 --> 11:59.051
That's a total
invasion of privacy.

11:59.135 --> 12:00.928
I don't want him in
here touching my stuff,

12:01.011 --> 12:02.555
sniffing through my
underwear drawer.

12:03.222 --> 12:04.265
Okay.

12:05.099 --> 12:06.851
Wait, I thought he goes
to bed at, like, 10:00.

12:07.393 --> 12:08.227
Yeah, usually.

12:08.310 --> 12:09.728
But lately
he's all freaked out

12:09.812 --> 12:11.564
because he's retiring
in a few weeks.

12:11.647 --> 12:13.566
He just roams the halls
drinking nightcaps.

12:13.649 --> 12:14.692
What's he freaked
out for though?

12:14.775 --> 12:16.152
'Cause isn't that good news?

12:16.235 --> 12:17.153
You'd think.

12:17.236 --> 12:20.030
But he, like, doesn't know what
to do with himself now, so.

12:20.197 --> 12:21.157
What about your mom?

12:21.991 --> 12:24.452
My mom died seven years
ago, so she's not much help.

12:24.952 --> 12:26.120
Oh my god, I'm so sorry.

12:26.203 --> 12:27.121
I didn't know.

12:27.371 --> 12:28.205
Whatever.

12:29.206 --> 12:31.625
I'm over it, but my dad
needs to find a new hobby

12:33.002 --> 12:34.420
because this
is getting ridiculous.

12:34.753 --> 12:35.713
Sugar free.

12:35.796 --> 12:36.630
Wait,
if you're grounded,

12:36.714 --> 12:37.673
then how are you
talking to me?

12:39.008 --> 12:40.176
Oh, he didn't
take my computer.

12:40.259 --> 12:42.761
He thinks I'm doing homework
on it, which is you.

12:42.845 --> 12:44.889
So I guess I'll be doing
you every day after school.

12:46.265 --> 12:47.266
Whoa.

12:47.850 --> 12:49.393
Mind out of the gutter,
little man.

12:49.727 --> 12:50.811
You're the one who said it.

12:51.228 --> 12:52.897
Girls are allowed to have
their mind in the gutter.

12:52.980 --> 12:53.939
It's sexy.

12:54.023 --> 12:55.774
When guys do it,
it's just, it's gross.

12:55.983 --> 12:57.443
I wasn't aware of that rule.

12:58.694 --> 12:59.612
Stick with me.

12:59.862 --> 13:00.696
You'll learn.

13:00.779 --> 13:01.864
Hey, sweetie?

13:02.156 --> 13:03.949
Hon, you've been up
here quite a while.

13:04.033 --> 13:05.201
You been playing video games?

13:05.284 --> 13:06.118
What?

13:06.202 --> 13:07.953
No, I'm talking
to my friend Madison.

13:08.454 --> 13:09.455
Hon, please don't.

13:09.872 --> 13:11.123
What?
I'm telling the truth!

13:11.707 --> 13:14.752
You know what Dr. Thomas said
about you making things up.

13:14.835 --> 13:16.253
Hi, Mrs. Johnson!

13:16.378 --> 13:19.340
Oh my, I'm sorry
I didn't realize.

13:19.548 --> 13:21.050
Madison Daniels,
do you remember me?

13:21.133 --> 13:22.927
I used to live down
the street from you.

13:23.427 --> 13:25.346
Madison, what a surprise.

13:25.846 --> 13:27.264
Madison Daniels,
of course I remember.

13:27.348 --> 13:29.183
You didn't tell me you were
talking to Madison Daniels.

13:29.266 --> 13:30.518
Yeah, actually, Mom, I did.

13:30.601 --> 13:33.479
Well, that's great,
that is just great!

13:33.938 --> 13:36.232
I won't interrupt you.

13:36.565 --> 13:37.816
Nice to see you again.

13:37.900 --> 13:39.193
You too, Mrs. Johnson.

13:40.110 --> 13:41.695
Madison Daniels, huh.

13:45.407 --> 13:46.242
See?

13:46.325 --> 13:47.576
My parents suck.

13:48.118 --> 13:49.328
She seems nice.

13:49.995 --> 13:51.622
You have no idea.

13:52.122 --> 13:53.499
You might think that
your parents suck,

13:53.582 --> 13:56.627
but that is just
a teenage syndrome

13:56.710 --> 13:58.796
that distorts your perception,

13:58.879 --> 14:03.509
when in actual scientifical
fact, they are perfectly legit.

14:04.093 --> 14:05.803
Who says I'm being
scientific about it?

14:06.470 --> 14:08.639
No, I'm just saying,
I need more proof

14:08.722 --> 14:09.848
before I accept your assertion.

14:10.558 --> 14:11.517
What are you, a lawyer?

14:11.976 --> 14:12.851
I'm gonna be.

14:13.769 --> 14:14.645
So pony up. Okay.

14:18.524 --> 14:22.194
My parents, every year,
make me try out for sports,

14:22.403 --> 14:24.613
even though I don't have
any talent or inclination

14:24.697 --> 14:26.949
or even the slightest
interest in the jock arts.

14:27.116 --> 14:28.409
Eh, wrong answer.

14:28.492 --> 14:30.035
They're just trying to make
sure that you're well rounded.

14:30.369 --> 14:31.579
Which is actually
the distinctive trait

14:31.662 --> 14:32.705
of a loving parent.

14:33.205 --> 14:37.334
Last year, I auditioned, or
tried out for the track team

14:37.585 --> 14:39.169
and I deliberately
ran as slow as I could

14:39.253 --> 14:40.546
so that I would get
cut from the team.

14:41.213 --> 14:42.339
Totally reasonable.

14:42.673 --> 14:45.342
Right, but then my mom
read the school guidelines

14:45.551 --> 14:47.595
and she discovered that
technically the coach isn't allowed

14:47.678 --> 14:48.679
to cut anybody
from the team.

14:48.804 --> 14:50.180
It's a little known secret.

14:50.264 --> 14:51.932
So she forced him
to let me run.

14:52.391 --> 14:54.810
It was like a whole
to do at my school

14:54.894 --> 14:58.147
and then finally we came up
with this shoddy compromise

14:58.230 --> 15:00.232
that kept me on the team as the mascot.

15:02.443 --> 15:03.652
What's the mascot?

15:13.454 --> 15:14.622
Oh no!

15:17.249 --> 15:18.083
Yeah.

15:18.792 --> 15:21.545
So now I'm at all
the track meets,

15:21.629 --> 15:23.297
which no one even goes
to in the first place,

15:23.380 --> 15:25.257
and I'm stuck wearing
this ratty old costume

15:25.341 --> 15:28.802
that hasn't seen the light
of day since like 1992.

15:30.095 --> 15:32.473
I think they just wanted
me to kind of get involved

15:32.556 --> 15:35.726
and make friends, but it
really just made me a target

15:35.809 --> 15:38.187
for the coach's kid who kept
kicking me in the shins.

15:38.979 --> 15:42.274
Okay, although misguided,
it came out of concern

15:42.358 --> 15:43.400
for your well being.

15:44.151 --> 15:45.694
They tried to get me to go
out for football this year,

15:45.778 --> 15:47.780
Mad, and I had to pretty
convincingly sprain an ankle

15:47.863 --> 15:48.864
to get out of that.

15:49.156 --> 15:51.742
Yes, okay, all dads want
their kids to play sports.

15:51.951 --> 15:54.536
That's like a primal instinct
from our hunter-gatherer days.

15:55.287 --> 15:57.206
It's not my dad,
it's my mom.

15:58.165 --> 15:59.083
Unexpected.

15:59.625 --> 16:01.168
Yeah, it's like
she's on this mission

16:01.251 --> 16:02.711
to keep me from becoming...

16:02.795 --> 16:03.629
A dweeb? Thanks.

16:07.216 --> 16:08.300
You'll survive.

16:09.426 --> 16:10.344
It gets worse.

16:11.303 --> 16:12.137
Always.

16:13.138 --> 16:14.515
You remember how I
said I wanted to audition

16:14.598 --> 16:15.516
<i>for Bye Bye Birdie? You did?</i>

16:17.601 --> 16:19.061
Yeah, I told you that
the first night we talked.

16:20.562 --> 16:21.605
Yeah, yeah.

16:21.689 --> 16:22.564
Bye Bye, yeah.

16:22.648 --> 16:23.565
Right.

16:23.649 --> 16:25.109
Well, I had
to miss the auditions

16:25.192 --> 16:28.070
because my mom decided we
should take a spontaneous trip

16:28.153 --> 16:29.279
to visit my grandma.

16:29.363 --> 16:30.406
Thank you, Mom.

16:31.031 --> 16:32.282
Family's important.

16:32.491 --> 16:34.368
Yeah, but grandma didn't
even want us to come.

16:34.535 --> 16:37.162
So not only did she
force us on grandma,

16:37.246 --> 16:40.082
probably just to ruin the long
weekend that she had planned

16:40.165 --> 16:41.959
with her man that
she's been seeing

16:42.167 --> 16:43.627
who's like 15 years
younger than her

16:43.711 --> 16:45.504
and totally just wants
her for her money,

16:45.587 --> 16:47.131
but that we should butt out of

16:47.214 --> 16:50.050
because it's grandma's only
source of happiness right now.

16:50.300 --> 16:52.845
But she also deliberately
ruined any chance that I had

16:52.928 --> 16:54.138
of being in the show.

16:55.305 --> 16:57.307
I don't know, the jury's still out on this
one. And she took grandma's car away from her

17:00.561 --> 17:02.187
because she's not
allowed to drive anymore,

17:02.271 --> 17:04.272
so now it's just sitting in
our garage instead of hers.

17:04.606 --> 17:06.525
And you're
complaining about what?

17:06.608 --> 17:08.193
She just scored you a car!

17:08.277 --> 17:09.528
Mad, I can't even drive it.

17:09.611 --> 17:10.779
She won't let me
get my license.

17:10.945 --> 17:12.531
"My mom won't let
me get my license."

17:13.323 --> 17:15.200
No wonder you're
grounded, you're mean.

17:15.284 --> 17:16.201
Nuh-uh.

17:16.535 --> 17:17.536
And manipulative.

17:17.618 --> 17:18.537
What?

17:18.619 --> 17:20.497
That poor Dix guy didn't
know what he had coming.

17:20.580 --> 17:21.707
Uh, wow.

17:21.790 --> 17:23.500
Where's all this
animosity coming from?

17:23.584 --> 17:25.502
I don't know, I'm just
calling it as I see it.

17:26.170 --> 17:28.547
Is this because I said
you don't have any friends?

17:30.758 --> 17:32.217
What? No.

17:33.010 --> 17:34.553
'Cause it's nothing to be ashamed of.

17:34.887 --> 17:35.888
I'm not ashamed of it.

17:36.472 --> 17:37.389
So you admit it!

17:38.057 --> 17:39.767
No, I don't...

17:40.350 --> 17:43.103
You are a devil woman.

17:46.607 --> 17:47.441
What?

17:50.527 --> 17:52.738
I'm gonna help you.

17:52.988 --> 17:53.947
I don't need help.

17:54.865 --> 17:55.866
Fine, not help.

17:55.949 --> 17:56.784
Coaching.

17:56.867 --> 17:59.078
No, I don't want
to be your project.

17:59.411 --> 18:00.871
Okay, okay.

18:00.954 --> 18:01.997
I'll be your friend.

18:02.122 --> 18:03.999
What is this,
second grade, Mad?

18:04.083 --> 18:06.376
And as your friend, I'm gonna
help you get more friends.

18:06.835 --> 18:08.837
I cannot believe we're
having this conversation.

18:09.588 --> 18:10.923
Okay, who's your best friend?

18:11.006 --> 18:12.382
I'm not answering
that question.

18:12.466 --> 18:13.467
Do you have a best friend?

18:15.803 --> 18:17.137
Who are your friends?

18:18.889 --> 18:20.599
Come on, Teel, just
give me some names.

18:22.726 --> 18:23.894
Do you have any friends?

18:23.977 --> 18:24.812
No!

18:26.271 --> 18:27.689
You don't have any friends?

18:28.232 --> 18:29.066
No.

18:32.152 --> 18:34.988
Not even people at school
that you casually talk to?

18:35.072 --> 18:36.115
Not really.

18:37.032 --> 18:39.660
I mostly just try to look
like I'm running late

18:39.743 --> 18:42.246
so nobody realizes I don't
have anybody to talk to.

18:45.290 --> 18:46.125
Wow.

18:48.127 --> 18:49.503
That's...

18:50.170 --> 18:51.213
really sad.

18:53.382 --> 18:56.051
Yeah. Well, that's kind
of why I wanted to try out

18:56.135 --> 18:58.053
<i>for Bye Bye Birdie, because I
thought I could at least fit in</i>

18:58.137 --> 18:59.304
with the theater geeks.

18:59.721 --> 19:00.681
What about Facebook?

19:01.682 --> 19:02.933
What about Facebook?

19:03.267 --> 19:04.685
Do you have any
friends on Facebook?

19:08.772 --> 19:10.315
Are you not on Facebook?

19:11.066 --> 19:12.484
You mean Fakebook?

19:12.693 --> 19:14.695
Okay, not everyone
on Facebook is fake.

19:15.028 --> 19:18.323
It's like,
it's like Clark Kent.

19:19.116 --> 19:20.826
How is it like Clark Kent?

19:21.201 --> 19:23.954
Clark Kent has a secret
identity and a public identity.

19:24.037 --> 19:25.706
You need your public identity.

19:26.957 --> 19:28.750
I just, I don't like
where this is headed.

19:28.834 --> 19:29.835
Okay, by the end
of the year,

19:29.918 --> 19:32.296
you're gonna have
150 Facebook friends.

19:32.546 --> 19:33.505
That is a promise.

19:34.631 --> 19:36.133
- Come on, it'll be easy!
- I think I'm gonna hurl.

19:36.216 --> 19:37.676
You don't even have to
talk to anyone face to face,

19:37.759 --> 19:39.720
you just have to add
them and that's it.

19:39.803 --> 19:41.555
- You need a Facebook
profile page.

19:44.183 --> 19:46.435
Okay, Madison, that
is a great idea.

19:46.518 --> 19:48.270
Thank you so much, yeah.

19:48.353 --> 19:51.440
"Yes, Madison,
that is a great idea."

19:52.524 --> 19:54.443
What is the worst
that can happen?

19:54.693 --> 19:56.445
I could find out
nobody likes me.

19:56.737 --> 19:58.447
How is that any
different from right now?

19:59.239 --> 20:00.282
Shut up.

20:01.158 --> 20:02.242
No, you shut up.

20:02.659 --> 20:03.785
Talk to the hand.

20:05.579 --> 20:07.706
So Sophie just told me
that fricking Ella Wilson

20:07.789 --> 20:08.874
is moving in on Cole.

20:08.957 --> 20:10.459
So while I'm stuck
here grounded,

20:10.542 --> 20:11.835
she's flirting her
ass off with him.

20:11.919 --> 20:13.712
And I do mean
her ass right off.

20:13.795 --> 20:17.424
She's super slutty but it
doesn't help that she's kinda hot

20:17.507 --> 20:19.259
in like a trashy sort of way.

20:20.385 --> 20:22.804
I mean, I can still flirt with
him in Earth Science and Math

20:22.888 --> 20:24.514
but she's in those
classes too!

20:25.265 --> 20:27.559
I do get Ella-free lunches
though, Tuesday and Thursday,

20:27.643 --> 20:29.353
because she goes
to talk time with my dad.

20:29.436 --> 20:30.270
Still.

20:30.354 --> 20:31.271
Wait, with your dad?

20:31.605 --> 20:33.649
Yeah, my dad's
my school principal

20:33.732 --> 20:36.568
and he's trying this
whole "You can talk to me,

20:36.652 --> 20:37.986
I'm one of you" thing.

20:38.070 --> 20:40.781
But really it's a bunch
of desperate girls clamoring

20:40.864 --> 20:42.532
for attention,
it's disgusting.

20:42.866 --> 20:44.868
I've forbidden
Sophie from going.

20:45.077 --> 20:45.953
Hey, Mad? What?

20:47.996 --> 20:49.539
I made a Facebook page.

20:49.748 --> 20:51.416
No, you didn't!

20:52.125 --> 20:53.752
Let me see.

20:57.589 --> 20:59.007
Oh!

20:59.258 --> 21:01.385
Oh, you're a handsome devil.

21:01.468 --> 21:02.344
Very funny.

21:02.427 --> 21:03.929
No, I'm serious,
you're really cute

21:04.012 --> 21:06.556
in, like, a Rhett
and Link sort of way.

21:06.765 --> 21:08.267
Yeah, well, there it is.

21:08.350 --> 21:10.477
Another reminder that
I have zero friends.

21:11.061 --> 21:11.895
Uh-uh.

21:12.771 --> 21:14.690
Not after you accept
my friend request.

21:15.565 --> 21:16.775
I don't know if I
should accept requests

21:16.858 --> 21:17.818
from just anybody.

21:17.901 --> 21:18.944
Har har.

21:21.321 --> 21:22.155
Fine.

21:23.365 --> 21:24.283
Accepted.

21:24.449 --> 21:25.993
What do you think
of my new profile pic?

21:26.618 --> 21:27.828
Where's the rest
of your skirt?

21:28.495 --> 21:31.081
Hey, if you got it,
you flaunt it.

21:34.334 --> 21:35.711
Hey, Facebook friends!

21:35.794 --> 21:37.004
Blam!

21:37.462 --> 21:38.880
That's amazing.

21:38.964 --> 21:40.215
And I want to get
Sophie to add you too,

21:40.299 --> 21:41.800
so that'll make it nine.

21:41.883 --> 21:43.552
They said it couldn't be done.

21:45.387 --> 21:46.221
Wait.

21:47.639 --> 21:48.515
What?

21:48.974 --> 21:50.726
None of these friends
go to your school!

21:51.226 --> 21:52.185
I thought we went over that.

21:52.269 --> 21:53.437
I don't have any
friends at school,

21:53.520 --> 21:55.230
so why would I
friend them online?

21:56.565 --> 21:57.733
Who's Parthoran?

21:58.066 --> 22:00.527
Is that his real name? He's just
a guy I met at the Akron Fanboy Expo.

22:04.114 --> 22:06.116
You talked
to someone you didn't know?

22:06.199 --> 22:09.077
It's way easier when
you're wearing a costume.

22:09.161 --> 22:10.787
Well,
what's his name?

22:10.871 --> 22:12.205
He goes by Parthoran.

22:12.706 --> 22:13.707
Where does he live?

22:14.124 --> 22:15.208
British Colombia.

22:16.209 --> 22:19.129
Teel, don't you want
friends from your own school?

22:19.379 --> 22:21.423
Yeah, but you have to have
at least some small reason

22:21.506 --> 22:22.716
to friend them, right?

22:23.842 --> 22:24.676
No.

22:24.760 --> 22:25.719
People are friend whores.

22:25.802 --> 22:27.304
I just don't know
if I want to be that.

22:28.138 --> 22:30.390
Will you just
join this century?

22:30.766 --> 22:31.683
Seriously.

22:31.892 --> 22:33.852
What about other people
from elementary school

22:33.935 --> 22:36.104
that you used to be friends
with but lost touch?

22:36.354 --> 22:37.189
Maybe.

22:39.107 --> 22:39.941
Such as? Teel!

22:43.070 --> 22:43.904
Sonny.

22:43.987 --> 22:45.322
Sonny Denbrowski.

22:45.864 --> 22:46.907
Sonny, there you go.

22:47.324 --> 22:49.117
But he's like
a jock boy tool now.

22:49.743 --> 22:51.203
Beggars can't be choosers.

22:57.876 --> 22:59.503
Cole joined choir!

23:00.212 --> 23:01.505
Can you believe it?

23:01.838 --> 23:04.508
Sophie and I have been
working on him for weeks

23:04.591 --> 23:05.926
and he finally caved.

23:06.343 --> 23:08.261
I think we're gonna survive
the Ella Wilson attacks.

23:08.345 --> 23:09.805
She only has two
classes with him now

23:09.888 --> 23:12.015
and now I have four,
including Health

23:12.099 --> 23:14.976
and next week we're doing
the unit on human sexuality,

23:15.060 --> 23:18.063
so I can say a whole bunch
of accidentally dirty comments

23:18.146 --> 23:19.606
and get him
in the right frame of mind.

23:19.689 --> 23:20.565
Gross.

23:21.191 --> 23:23.401
Oh, and I have Sophie
running interference for me,

23:23.485 --> 23:24.736
while I'm grounded.
So her instructions

23:24.820 --> 23:26.863
are to interrupt
all conversations

23:26.947 --> 23:30.408
between Ella and Cole and to
never, ever let them touch.

23:30.575 --> 23:31.993
Which is gonna be
quite a project

23:32.077 --> 23:33.620
because Ella is super grabby.
Wait, when did you go to the beach?

23:35.539 --> 23:37.374
I thought you were grounded.

23:37.874 --> 23:39.084
Oh, no.

23:39.209 --> 23:41.128
The internet doesn't need
to know that I'm grounded.

23:41.294 --> 23:43.004
These are old,
from the summer.

23:43.713 --> 23:44.714
Don't I look hot?

23:45.340 --> 23:47.092
If you mean sweaty,
then yeah.

23:48.218 --> 23:49.344
That's my beach glow.

23:49.970 --> 23:51.012
I'm not a slut.

23:51.471 --> 23:52.472
I didn't say that.

23:52.597 --> 23:54.141
Then why are
you criticizing my pictures?

23:54.432 --> 23:55.684
I'm not criticizing them.

23:55.809 --> 23:57.102
First my skirt is too short

23:57.185 --> 23:59.187
and now you think that
I'm some sweaty whore?

23:59.938 --> 24:01.690
You don't look like a...

24:01.773 --> 24:02.858
Look, I can post
whatever I want.

24:02.941 --> 24:04.067
I don't need your opinion.

24:04.276 --> 24:05.235
You asked me!

24:05.318 --> 24:07.529
Yeah, learn to spot when
a girl wants a compliment.

24:08.113 --> 24:09.030
Okay, I'm sorry.

24:09.114 --> 24:10.699
I didn't mean it,
I was just like...

24:14.244 --> 24:15.162
You look hot.

24:15.245 --> 24:16.955
You look totally hot.

24:17.289 --> 24:18.331
You don't mean that.

24:18.665 --> 24:19.499
Yeah, I do.

24:19.583 --> 24:22.127
I just felt weird saying
it to you because...

24:23.837 --> 24:24.921
I don't know.

24:26.840 --> 24:27.883
What's wrong?

24:28.550 --> 24:29.384
Nothing.

24:31.303 --> 24:32.762
- Are you sure?
- I have to go.

24:32.846 --> 24:33.847
Wait, Mad! Did you friend Sonny?

24:40.687 --> 24:42.147
Uh, hi, Madison.

24:42.230 --> 24:43.523
Are you feeling better?

24:43.815 --> 24:44.941
Yes, did you friend him?

24:45.233 --> 24:46.067
Yeah.

24:47.027 --> 24:49.237
Are we gonna talk
about yesterday or?

24:49.404 --> 24:50.989
Live in the now.
What happened?

24:51.448 --> 24:53.366
He accepted my request.

24:53.533 --> 24:57.412
Your first
Facebook friend at school.

24:57.913 --> 24:59.247
Yeah, it's all very good

24:59.331 --> 25:00.916
but it's not like
it means anything.

25:01.208 --> 25:02.167
Why not?

25:02.250 --> 25:03.919
Because he just
sits there on a list.

25:04.211 --> 25:05.086
So?

25:05.587 --> 25:07.088
Then look at his feed.

25:07.380 --> 25:08.632
Learn something about him.

25:08.715 --> 25:10.508
Maybe you can start
a conversation that way.

25:11.009 --> 25:11.927
Maybe.

25:12.010 --> 25:13.428
And you gotta post
stuff too, okay?

25:13.511 --> 25:14.471
You're in the game now.

25:14.721 --> 25:16.598
No, Mad, I hate
all that stuff!

25:16.681 --> 25:20.018
It's all like
"Oh, I'm playing my Xbox.

25:20.143 --> 25:21.144
Look at me play fast.

25:21.228 --> 25:22.354
Look at me play slow.

25:22.437 --> 25:24.022
Look at me play boring."

25:24.105 --> 25:25.941
Okay, then we'll post
something interesting

25:26.024 --> 25:27.734
and somebody might
be interested.

25:28.026 --> 25:29.027
I doubt it.

25:29.611 --> 25:31.821
T, sometimes
it's just for you.

25:32.739 --> 25:33.949
I talked to Sonny today.

25:34.032 --> 25:34.950
Amazing!

25:35.242 --> 25:36.117
Let's hear.

25:36.493 --> 25:37.702
It's nothing.

25:37.786 --> 25:39.621
We just had this
biology test today

25:39.704 --> 25:41.498
and he sits right
behind me in class.

25:41.748 --> 25:44.292
So I was like
"You ready for the test?"

25:44.376 --> 25:46.544
And he was like
"Not even close."

25:47.045 --> 25:49.005
And then we took the test.

25:52.300 --> 25:53.426
Oh, okay, yeah.

25:53.677 --> 25:54.511
Awesome.

25:56.054 --> 25:56.972
Yay.

25:57.806 --> 25:58.765
No girls.

25:58.932 --> 26:00.350
What do you mean no girls?

26:00.433 --> 26:03.895
I mean, no, I don't have my
eye on any girls right now.

26:03.979 --> 26:05.605
Not even your
peripheral vision?

26:06.982 --> 26:08.566
Look, I'm sorry...

26:08.650 --> 26:09.901
The connection...

26:09.985 --> 26:10.819
Failure...

26:12.362 --> 26:14.364
Teel, come on!

26:14.781 --> 26:16.449
You're telling me there's
not a single pretty girl

26:16.533 --> 26:18.535
at your school that you think
about more than the others?

26:18.618 --> 26:20.453
There are lots of pretty
girls at my school, Mad,

26:20.537 --> 26:22.038
but most of them
are stuck up bitches

26:22.122 --> 26:23.290
so I'm not really interested.

26:23.748 --> 26:25.250
But you're such a flirt!

26:25.667 --> 26:27.127
I am not a flirt.

26:27.294 --> 26:28.795
Yes, you are!

26:28.962 --> 26:31.548
You flirt with me every
single time we talk.

26:32.507 --> 26:34.259
You're telling none of
that raw charm is spent

26:34.342 --> 26:35.427
on any other girl?

26:35.552 --> 26:37.804
I think you think I live
in a very different world

26:37.887 --> 26:38.972
than I think I live in.

26:39.222 --> 26:40.890
I think you
think I think that.

26:41.474 --> 26:42.392
Shut up.

26:43.810 --> 26:44.978
I'm just saying!

26:45.145 --> 26:46.479
"I'm just saying."

26:47.689 --> 26:48.606
Oh.

26:49.399 --> 26:50.233
Oh, I see.

26:50.984 --> 26:51.860
What?

26:51.943 --> 26:52.902
No, it's cool.

26:52.986 --> 26:53.820
I get it.

26:54.070 --> 26:55.989
- What?
- Nothing, I just...

26:56.072 --> 26:57.532
No need to say another word.

26:58.074 --> 26:59.868
What are
you talking about?

27:00.160 --> 27:02.245
I see who you're saving
the good stuff for.

27:04.456 --> 27:05.332
What?

27:05.415 --> 27:06.750
What good stuff?

27:08.335 --> 27:09.419
Seriously, what?

27:09.753 --> 27:12.130
Screen tells me
all I need to know.

27:14.883 --> 27:16.968
He accused me of cheating.

27:17.344 --> 27:18.928
Not like I was cheating
off of someone else

27:19.012 --> 27:21.222
because he knows I got like
the best grade in the class,

27:21.598 --> 27:23.892
but apparently the second
half of Sonny's scantron

27:23.975 --> 27:25.268
was, like, identical to mine.

27:25.352 --> 27:27.395
So now Mr. Hanson thinks I
was just holding up my test

27:27.479 --> 27:29.314
so Sonny could look
over my shoulder.

27:29.647 --> 27:31.900
But why would I help him, Mad?

27:31.983 --> 27:34.944
He's a macho jackass
who I only friended

27:35.028 --> 27:36.154
because you made me.

27:36.696 --> 27:38.782
He just sat there the
whole time with this, like,

27:38.865 --> 27:41.576
tight shirt on and all
the girls in the hallway

27:41.659 --> 27:43.244
were creaming their pants.

27:44.287 --> 27:47.874
T, I'm very sorry, but
I've got a situation here.

27:48.333 --> 27:50.085
Bigger than a cheating scandal?

27:50.710 --> 27:51.961
Yeah, actually.

27:52.045 --> 27:53.046
Two words.

27:53.338 --> 27:54.631
Retardedment party.

27:55.715 --> 27:56.841
Offensive much?

27:57.509 --> 27:59.719
Just because he's retiring,
the school board

27:59.803 --> 28:02.180
and the booster club want
to throw my dad a party.

28:02.263 --> 28:03.848
Well, that's according to him.

28:04.099 --> 28:06.976
So my dad thought
"Oh, I can't use

28:07.060 --> 28:09.521
the school board's resources
for nonessential purposes.

28:09.604 --> 28:11.648
Why doesn't my daughter
throw the party?"

28:12.148 --> 28:14.109
So now I'm stuck
planning the party

28:14.192 --> 28:16.152
that the school board
wants to throw for my dad

28:16.236 --> 28:18.655
and I have to do all this
crap like invitations,

28:18.738 --> 28:21.116
decorations,
food, invitations.

28:21.199 --> 28:22.409
You said invitations twice.

28:22.826 --> 28:24.911
Not to mention
the doppelganger cake.

28:25.453 --> 28:27.080
Clarification please?

28:27.455 --> 28:29.874
That's the exact replica
of Mrs. Spiceman's cake

28:29.958 --> 28:32.127
that I have to bake
because hers will be

28:32.210 --> 28:35.046
positively unpalatable and
probably give everyone the runs

28:35.130 --> 28:36.965
- if it's anything
like last year's.

28:37.298 --> 28:38.800
T, don't laugh!

28:38.883 --> 28:40.719
My dad's actually
making me do this!

28:41.177 --> 28:43.179
Can't you just ask
her not to bake one?

28:43.430 --> 28:46.474
No, she's like the school
board's biggest donor

28:46.558 --> 28:47.392
or something.

28:48.143 --> 28:49.185
Truth comes out.

28:49.978 --> 28:51.980
And now he's gonna
be home all the time

28:52.063 --> 28:53.606
and I'm gonna have to wife
it up for him even more

28:53.690 --> 28:54.899
than I already do.

28:54.983 --> 28:57.152
That man can't, like,
do anything for himself.

28:57.318 --> 28:59.696
I'm gonna have to make his
food and change his diaper

28:59.779 --> 29:02.073
and god knows what else
now that he doesn't have

29:02.157 --> 29:03.867
an administrative assistant.

29:04.242 --> 29:06.077
You're trying to win.

29:07.078 --> 29:07.912
What?

29:08.329 --> 29:11.499
Yeah, you're trying to win
the sucky parent contest.

29:12.751 --> 29:13.710
Whatever.

29:14.002 --> 29:15.587
You love planning parties.

29:15.670 --> 29:19.883
Even mentally challenged
parties for your dad.

29:20.425 --> 29:22.302
I bet you're telling all
your friends about this

29:22.385 --> 29:24.387
and relishing every
minute of extra attention

29:24.471 --> 29:25.847
that you get
for your suffering.

29:25.930 --> 29:27.056
Okay, no, I'm not.

29:27.140 --> 29:29.559
And also, by the way,
if you enjoy the suffering

29:29.642 --> 29:31.895
caused by your parents,
then that negates the suckage

29:31.978 --> 29:34.314
and instantly disqualifies
you from the contest.

29:34.397 --> 29:37.692
Okay, first of all,
there is no contest.

29:37.776 --> 29:40.945
And even if there was,
trust me, I would win.

29:44.866 --> 29:45.992
Who's here?

29:53.082 --> 29:54.083
It's Sonny.

29:54.375 --> 29:55.210
Wait, Sonny?

29:55.293 --> 29:56.336
The Sonny?

29:56.961 --> 29:57.796
Yeah.

29:58.922 --> 30:00.423
What the hell is he doing here?

30:02.050 --> 30:02.884
I don't know.

30:02.967 --> 30:04.177
What are you waiting for?

30:05.136 --> 30:06.137
Go!

30:06.221 --> 30:07.180
T, go!

30:07.639 --> 30:08.723
Okay, okay.

30:10.016 --> 30:10.850
- T!
- What,

30:10.934 --> 30:11.810
what?

30:11.893 --> 30:12.936
Take me with you!

30:13.144 --> 30:14.354
Okay, I'm bringing...

30:15.146 --> 30:16.147
What do I say to him?

30:16.356 --> 30:17.857
Jesus, T, it's like
your first day as a human!

30:17.941 --> 30:19.067
Well, I don't
know what he wants.

30:19.234 --> 30:20.860
He's the same guy you
hung out with before.

30:21.152 --> 30:23.071
- No, he's not,
not even close.

30:25.573 --> 30:26.449
Let me see!

30:26.533 --> 30:27.617
He's just standing there.

30:27.784 --> 30:30.286
Wait, T, I lost the picture.

30:30.662 --> 30:31.496
T!

30:31.579 --> 30:32.956
Do I open the door?

30:33.122 --> 30:34.123
Yes, open the door!

30:34.207 --> 30:35.124
Okay.

30:37.418 --> 30:38.336
Hey.

30:38.503 --> 30:39.879
Sonny, what's up?

30:39.963 --> 30:40.797
Hey.

30:40.880 --> 30:42.423
Oh, he is scrumptious.

30:42.507 --> 30:45.093
My mom said I should
apologize to you for cheating

30:45.176 --> 30:46.302
off you in class today.

30:46.678 --> 30:47.762
T, I can't see.

30:48.012 --> 30:48.930
What?

30:49.305 --> 30:52.600
I can't see why you'd
feel like you'd have to.

30:52.892 --> 30:55.019
It's totally cool,
I understand.

30:55.311 --> 30:56.396
Thanks for stopping by.

30:56.479 --> 30:57.647
What are you doing?

30:57.730 --> 30:59.107
What is that?

30:59.566 --> 31:02.277
Oh, it's nothing, I was just on
the phone with my friend and...

31:02.360 --> 31:04.279
Hey, Sonny,
I thought that was you.

31:04.362 --> 31:06.447
Come in, come in, come
in for a few minutes.

31:06.531 --> 31:09.450
I could scoop you and
Terrance some ice cream.

31:09.534 --> 31:10.743
Like old times.

31:10.827 --> 31:12.245
Sure, that sounds great.

31:12.328 --> 31:13.162
Wait.

31:13.246 --> 31:14.330
Who's Terrance?

31:15.707 --> 31:17.458
Shut up.

31:18.918 --> 31:20.962
Well, hello there, Terrance.

31:21.462 --> 31:23.006
Ha, very funny.

31:23.131 --> 31:24.215
Why didn't you call me?

31:24.507 --> 31:26.009
I wanted to know what happened!

31:26.092 --> 31:27.552
I don't know, I
just didn't feel like it.

31:27.635 --> 31:29.470
I texted you like six times.

31:29.554 --> 31:30.680
I noticed.

31:30.889 --> 31:33.182
Well, I saw those mean
posts on your Facebook.

31:33.266 --> 31:34.767
I wanted to know
what's going on.

31:35.476 --> 31:36.853
Why is your camera not on?

31:38.855 --> 31:39.898
Must be broken.

31:39.981 --> 31:42.066
Okay, that is the stupidest
lie I've ever heard.

31:42.150 --> 31:44.944
Seriously, it must
be like a bug or something.

31:45.278 --> 31:46.529
Whatever, turn it on.

31:47.739 --> 31:49.073
Can we just
talk like this today?

31:49.157 --> 31:50.241
No, why?

31:50.325 --> 31:51.743
To keep up the mystery.

31:51.826 --> 31:53.328
Shut up and turn it on.

31:53.661 --> 31:54.537
I can't.

31:55.413 --> 31:56.581
Are you naked or something?

31:56.831 --> 31:57.665
No.

31:58.708 --> 31:59.626
Then turn it on!

31:59.709 --> 32:00.919
Or I'm hanging up.

32:01.252 --> 32:02.712
Wait, wait,
please don't hang up.

32:03.254 --> 32:04.172
T.

32:04.255 --> 32:06.382
Okay, seriously, I got
my life back today.

32:06.466 --> 32:08.635
I am officially ungrounded and
I may never talk to you again

32:08.718 --> 32:10.011
so this might
be your last chance.

32:10.303 --> 32:11.804
Okay.

32:16.517 --> 32:17.518
Oh my god.

32:18.978 --> 32:20.355
T, what happened?

32:21.272 --> 32:22.273
Nothing, I just fell.

32:23.316 --> 32:24.400
On your face?

32:24.817 --> 32:25.818
Repeatedly?

32:26.319 --> 32:29.614
I was
playing some sports.

32:29.739 --> 32:30.740
Some sports?

32:31.449 --> 32:32.283
Yeah.

32:33.868 --> 32:35.328
T, did you get in a fight?

32:36.037 --> 32:36.871
No.

32:38.456 --> 32:40.333
What else would
make your face look like that?

32:42.293 --> 32:45.421
A fight implies that I
was an active participant.

32:47.131 --> 32:48.049
You got beat up?

32:50.343 --> 32:51.177
By who?

32:52.011 --> 32:53.554
Just a bunch of ass cavities.

32:53.638 --> 32:54.639
At your school?

32:55.098 --> 32:56.057
Yeah.

32:56.307 --> 32:57.392
Did you tell someone?

32:57.809 --> 32:58.726
No.

32:59.769 --> 33:01.354
What did you
tell your parents?

33:01.437 --> 33:03.189
Could we talk about
something else, please?

33:03.272 --> 33:05.525
No, your face literally
looks like a hamburger.

33:05.608 --> 33:07.777
Mad, can we please talk
about something else?

33:07.986 --> 33:08.945
Okay.

33:09.278 --> 33:10.196
Terrance.

33:10.738 --> 33:11.823
And not that either.

33:11.906 --> 33:12.865
I don't like it.

33:13.449 --> 33:16.160
Come on, Terrance, I need
to know your origin story.

33:16.244 --> 33:17.078
Please?

33:18.746 --> 33:19.998
I'm gonna keep
calling you Terrance.

33:20.248 --> 33:21.624
You're so annoying.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.626
That's not very nice, Terrance.

33:25.003 --> 33:25.837
Fine.

33:27.797 --> 33:31.009
My dad started calling me
Teel when I was a little kid

33:31.092 --> 33:33.177
because I would always
run around the house

33:33.261 --> 33:36.597
wearing, like, a cape yelling
"I'm the Man of Teel!"

33:37.181 --> 33:39.058
I couldn't
pronounce my Ss yet.

33:39.142 --> 33:39.976
Oh!

33:40.435 --> 33:43.312
Yeah, so now my mom is the
only one who calls me Terrance

33:43.396 --> 33:44.439
and I hate it.

33:44.856 --> 33:47.275
My name is Teel and that's
what you should call me.

33:47.483 --> 33:48.901
I can't call you T anymore?

33:51.446 --> 33:53.406
T is... T is fine.

33:54.949 --> 33:56.951
Okay, so I need to hurry
because Cole's performing

33:57.035 --> 33:58.327
at the school
talent show tonight

33:58.411 --> 34:01.247
and my dad's giving, like, his last
speech as principal or whatever.

34:01.330 --> 34:02.331
He's all freaked out.

34:02.415 --> 34:04.125
He just walked in on me
while I was showering.

34:04.292 --> 34:06.878
He couldn't wait ten minutes
to borrow my shaving cream?

34:06.961 --> 34:08.755
I was all like "Dad, get out!"

34:08.838 --> 34:11.257
And he's all like "Nothing
I've never seen before."

34:11.340 --> 34:12.175
Whatever.

34:12.257 --> 34:14.635
I don't even care though
because tonight I'm a free woman.

34:15.344 --> 34:17.388
I am ungrounded!

34:17.972 --> 34:21.391
Mad, I think you
wear too much makeup.

34:22.851 --> 34:24.312
That's not insulting.

34:24.395 --> 34:26.313
No, no, don't
freak out, please.

34:27.231 --> 34:29.775
I just think you look better
without makeup than with.

34:30.234 --> 34:32.027
You've never seen
me without makeup on!

34:32.110 --> 34:33.154
Actually, I have.

34:33.237 --> 34:35.489
It was the accidental
pool party?

34:35.572 --> 34:36.491
That night?

34:37.074 --> 34:37.949
Okay, so?

34:38.909 --> 34:41.579
So I just think when you
put on all that makeup,

34:41.913 --> 34:45.083
it hides everything that's
beautiful about your face.

34:45.458 --> 34:46.833
T, I have to wear some.

34:47.168 --> 34:48.210
No, no, I know.

34:48.668 --> 34:49.879
I just think you
should wear less.

34:50.505 --> 34:52.882
So we see more of you.

34:53.466 --> 34:55.592
T, you can't do
this to me right now!

34:55.676 --> 34:57.053
Cole's gonna be there!

34:57.345 --> 34:59.555
I know, I know,
that's why I'm telling you.

34:59.764 --> 35:02.058
I was already freaking
out about seeing him.

35:02.683 --> 35:04.060
And now you drop this on me?

35:04.519 --> 35:05.520
I know.

35:05.770 --> 35:07.730
Just let me help you.

35:08.189 --> 35:09.273
What do you mean?

35:09.649 --> 35:11.067
Let me help you
put on your makeup.

35:11.651 --> 35:12.610
No!

35:13.027 --> 35:15.488
Just try it for one
day and if you don't like it,

35:15.571 --> 35:17.240
then you can go back
to your old way.

35:17.323 --> 35:18.449
What do you know
about makeup?

35:19.117 --> 35:21.410
My mom's a hairdresser
who also does makeup,

35:21.494 --> 35:24.122
so I've been watching her since
I was literally a little kid.

35:24.205 --> 35:25.498
I can do this.

35:25.832 --> 35:26.749
Fine.

35:27.125 --> 35:27.959
"Fine"?

35:29.460 --> 35:30.503
Fine!

35:32.255 --> 35:33.089
Okay, good.

35:34.257 --> 35:35.591
Now just look right
into the camera

35:35.675 --> 35:36.843
and I'll tell you
what to do.

35:37.510 --> 35:39.220
No, like right into the camera.

35:40.847 --> 35:41.889
Okay!

35:42.348 --> 35:43.182
Good. T!

35:46.310 --> 35:47.228
Okay, okay.

35:49.605 --> 35:51.274
Start with powder.

35:51.440 --> 35:53.025
"Powder"? I don't have
any foundation on.

35:53.484 --> 35:54.652
You don't need it.

35:54.735 --> 35:56.612
Yes, I do.
I am way too pale.

35:56.988 --> 35:59.448
No, you don't,
your skin is like flawless,

35:59.532 --> 36:01.325
it's the best feature of your face.
Plus, it's a good thing to be pale.

36:03.411 --> 36:04.370
How?

36:04.495 --> 36:05.788
You ever heard of Snow White?

36:05.997 --> 36:07.790
You are such a nerd!

36:07.874 --> 36:10.042
Trust me, less is more.

36:20.469 --> 36:21.345
Good.

36:21.971 --> 36:23.514
Now eyes.

36:24.390 --> 36:25.808
Just a little shadow.

36:35.902 --> 36:36.944
That's good, that's good.

36:38.321 --> 36:39.322
Now mascara.

36:39.447 --> 36:40.531
No, uh-uh. I need eyeliner.

36:41.908 --> 36:42.950
I have bug eyes.

36:43.159 --> 36:45.328
Fine, fine, but it has to be
the lightest brown you have.

36:45.912 --> 36:46.913
Why would I use brown?

36:47.371 --> 36:48.623
And it needs to be razor thin,

36:48.706 --> 36:50.249
so we don't even
know we're seeing it.

36:59.759 --> 37:00.593
Good. Good.

37:12.647 --> 37:13.856
And mascara?

37:15.316 --> 37:16.567
Unless you
want to skip it.

37:16.943 --> 37:17.818
No.

37:30.206 --> 37:31.457
Okay, that's plenty.

37:32.166 --> 37:33.209
What color blush do you have?

37:33.834 --> 37:35.336
I use this one.

37:36.212 --> 37:38.047
No, that's way
too orange for you.

37:38.339 --> 37:39.882
You want your cheeks
to look like apples.

37:40.716 --> 37:41.884
What about the red one?

37:42.260 --> 37:43.094
This one?

37:43.177 --> 37:44.095
Yeah.

37:44.553 --> 37:45.846
So I can look like a whore?

37:46.472 --> 37:47.807
You won't
look like a whore,

37:47.890 --> 37:49.183
just don't put so much on.

37:50.893 --> 37:52.853
You just brush it on
really lightly, yeah.

38:02.154 --> 38:02.989
Good.

38:04.073 --> 38:04.907
Now lips.

38:05.616 --> 38:06.701
Not your usual red.

38:07.493 --> 38:10.705
We're going regular lip gloss.

38:12.915 --> 38:14.542
You are killing me.

38:14.959 --> 38:16.711
Something shiny
but without color.

38:16.961 --> 38:18.379
Your lips are already perfect.

38:21.757 --> 38:22.925
Yeah, that's great.

38:33.602 --> 38:35.438
Now let me just look
at you for a second.

38:44.822 --> 38:47.241
Don't look at me like that,
you're making me nervous!

38:47.825 --> 38:51.120
Now I dare you to not look in
the mirror for the whole day

38:51.203 --> 38:52.913
and just notice how
people react to you.

38:57.543 --> 38:58.544
Okay.

38:59.086 --> 39:00.463
You look beautiful.

39:04.467 --> 39:05.301
Shut up.

39:06.761 --> 39:07.803
T!

39:11.223 --> 39:12.850
Forward to
tonight's performances.

39:13.100 --> 39:14.560
As many of you know...

39:14.643 --> 39:15.603
It's my dad.

39:15.686 --> 39:18.022
- I'll be retiring in a few weeks.
- Droning on.

39:18.272 --> 39:19.482
You're thrilled, I know.

39:20.524 --> 39:23.110
I've spent time getting to
know each and every one of you.

39:23.194 --> 39:24.236
It's Cole.

39:24.445 --> 39:27.073
- That means you, Chad Mendez.
- Isn't he yummy?

39:28.157 --> 39:30.034
I've always told
you to look in the now.

39:30.159 --> 39:32.787
- Oh, shut up.
- But I want you to know that after...

40:04.485 --> 40:05.486
Oh my god.

40:10.574 --> 40:11.700
Okay, okay, okay.

40:11.784 --> 40:12.743
I'm gonna do it.

40:14.161 --> 40:15.246
There she goes.

40:20.334 --> 40:21.293
Cole?

40:21.710 --> 40:24.338
You were, like, amazing.

40:24.547 --> 40:25.381
Thanks.

40:25.464 --> 40:26.590
These are for you.

40:28.676 --> 40:29.677
You were amazing.

40:29.844 --> 40:31.303
I just sang what
I felt, you know?

40:31.387 --> 40:32.263
Yeah, totally.

40:32.638 --> 40:33.848
Yeah, totally.

40:36.308 --> 40:37.977
Wow, flowers.

40:38.060 --> 40:38.894
Yeah.

40:43.065 --> 40:46.026
Well, you look,
you know, like.

40:47.445 --> 40:48.446
Thank you.

40:50.906 --> 40:52.575
Hey, you know, it sucks
that your dad's retiring

40:52.658 --> 40:55.453
because he's like,
he's the best.

40:55.703 --> 40:57.705
Oh, no, that's 'cause
he's not your dad.

40:57.955 --> 41:00.082
- But you know.
- You still grounded and stuff?

41:00.166 --> 41:01.041
No.

41:01.375 --> 41:02.918
Well, my parents
aren't home tonight

41:03.085 --> 41:06.213
and I wanted to know
if you want to come over.

41:07.756 --> 41:08.716
Yeah.

41:08.799 --> 41:10.009
Yeah, yeah.

41:10.551 --> 41:13.304
Yeah, I could
make time, yeah.

41:13.846 --> 41:15.014
- Cool, I'll text you.
- Okay.

41:15.431 --> 41:16.307
- Okay.
- Bye.

41:21.812 --> 41:22.730
T!

41:23.272 --> 41:24.899
You are a genius!

41:25.441 --> 41:27.026
Oh, easy now.

41:27.776 --> 41:30.029
Okay, Mr. Fashion Consultant.

41:30.279 --> 41:32.364
You have to help me choose
what to wear to Cole's

41:32.448 --> 41:33.407
for the big night.

41:33.991 --> 41:35.826
You really think
tonight's the big night?

41:36.118 --> 41:36.952
Duh.

41:37.369 --> 41:38.579
Didn't you hear that song?

41:38.662 --> 41:40.456
It was totally about me.

41:40.789 --> 41:42.249
We could do,

41:43.083 --> 41:44.502
this shirt with jeans.

41:45.002 --> 41:46.420
But then I'd have
to wear a thong.

41:47.171 --> 41:48.464
T, help!

41:48.839 --> 41:50.049
What about the dress?

41:50.799 --> 41:51.759
"The dress"?

41:52.134 --> 41:53.010
The dress?

41:53.093 --> 41:54.178
What am I, like 30?

41:54.470 --> 41:55.846
At least try it on for me?

41:58.224 --> 41:59.058
Okay.

42:01.977 --> 42:03.145
Whoa, wait, whoa.

42:03.270 --> 42:04.396
What are you doing?

42:04.647 --> 42:06.023
A little shy, Mr. T?

42:06.357 --> 42:07.233
No.

42:07.900 --> 42:10.194
T, okay, when you
have a girlfriend

42:10.444 --> 42:12.154
and you're gonna want
to have sex with her,

42:12.238 --> 42:13.531
you're gonna have
to see her naked.

42:14.114 --> 42:16.951
Okay, well, for now can
you please just go off screen

42:17.034 --> 42:17.868
or something?

42:18.786 --> 42:19.745
Okay.

42:19.828 --> 42:21.288
But you don't know
what you're missing!

42:38.597 --> 42:39.431
Wear that.

42:39.974 --> 42:40.933
Really?

42:41.016 --> 42:42.017
Yes, really.

42:42.101 --> 42:44.019
It's ridiculously
gorgeous, wear it.

42:44.520 --> 42:47.314
I'm sorry, T, I'm gonna have
to use my veto power here.

42:48.023 --> 42:50.109
This shows more skin.

42:52.820 --> 42:55.406
T, I can't believe
this is happening.

42:55.864 --> 42:57.366
Please be careful, Mad.

42:57.825 --> 42:59.076
Okay, Dad.

43:00.911 --> 43:01.870
Who else is here?

43:01.954 --> 43:02.788
I hear music.

43:08.669 --> 43:10.004
Mad, you made it! - Hi.
- Hi.

43:17.303 --> 43:18.554
I guess it could
have been worse.

43:19.555 --> 43:20.598
It was worse.

43:20.681 --> 43:21.682
Oh yeah. Oh yeah,

43:21.765 --> 43:24.226
I forgot, Cole
and Sophie, they had sex.

43:24.893 --> 43:26.645
With Sophie Sophie?

43:27.021 --> 43:28.439
Are you effing kidding me?

43:28.897 --> 43:29.815
How convenient, right?

43:29.898 --> 43:31.442
Apparently after
they dropped me off,

43:31.525 --> 43:33.068
they went back to his
house and had sex.

43:33.235 --> 43:35.154
Big fat betrayal sex.

43:36.488 --> 43:37.448
How do you know?

43:38.574 --> 43:40.284
Oh, it's all over Facebook.

43:40.367 --> 43:41.910
And when I tried to
talk to her about it,

43:41.994 --> 43:43.829
she full on lies to my face.

43:49.084 --> 43:50.961
You know, Mad,
I think it's for the best.

43:53.088 --> 43:54.089
How?

43:54.214 --> 43:55.382
Because you don't
want your first time

43:55.466 --> 43:57.426
to be some hookup at a party.

43:57.926 --> 43:59.803
It was not a hookup!

43:59.887 --> 44:01.096
It was Cole.

44:01.430 --> 44:04.391
And besides, it was not my, no.

44:05.434 --> 44:06.268
What?

44:11.148 --> 44:13.859
It wasn't... what?

44:16.445 --> 44:17.863
Your first time?

44:21.075 --> 44:23.744
Madison, are you
keeping secrets?

44:24.995 --> 44:26.080
Madison!

44:27.998 --> 44:29.333
Oh.

44:29.541 --> 44:30.459
How could you...

44:31.043 --> 44:32.711
How could you not tell me that?

44:33.045 --> 44:34.046
Who did you have sex with?

44:34.254 --> 44:35.756
I can't do this!

44:36.215 --> 44:37.299
I can't do this!

44:37.383 --> 44:39.927
I keep trying and I keep
messing it up!

44:40.344 --> 44:41.387
I'm sure they're fine.

44:41.470 --> 44:42.930
No, they're not,
they're not fine!

44:43.013 --> 44:44.682
They're not fine,
they have to be perfect!

44:44.765 --> 44:47.184
My dad is gonna see them
and they have to be perfect.

44:48.018 --> 44:49.436
He's not gonna mind.
No, it has to be perfect!

44:51.021 --> 44:53.440
I'm...
starting over.

44:54.733 --> 44:55.901
Hey, look, Mads.

44:55.984 --> 44:56.860
Stop.

44:57.361 --> 44:58.278
Let me see.

44:59.696 --> 45:00.531
Let me see. What?

45:04.284 --> 45:06.036
It has a smudge right there!

45:06.120 --> 45:07.162
It looks great.

45:08.080 --> 45:09.665
No, they don't.

45:15.921 --> 45:17.798
Mad, Cole's an idiot.

45:19.466 --> 45:21.844
I can't imagine what
he was thinking.

45:22.302 --> 45:24.471
You're so much
prettier than Sophie.

45:24.555 --> 45:25.514
I'm not pretty.

45:27.891 --> 45:29.893
You're right, you're not
pretty, you're beautiful.

45:31.437 --> 45:32.354
Shut up.

45:32.438 --> 45:33.313
I mean it.

45:33.730 --> 45:36.483
You're intelligent
and beautiful...

45:37.234 --> 45:39.528
You're an intelligent
and beautiful girl.

45:40.988 --> 45:41.905
Woman.

45:42.406 --> 45:44.575
Woman, even, Mad.

45:45.159 --> 45:48.412
You're an intelligent and
beautiful woman who's fun

45:48.495 --> 45:53.375
and funny and interesting
and mysterious.

45:53.750 --> 45:54.751
And beautiful.

45:54.835 --> 45:56.170
You said that three times.

45:56.420 --> 45:57.629
It was four.

46:07.055 --> 46:10.309
By the way, I have
37 Facebook friends.

46:11.351 --> 46:12.269
That's great.

46:16.106 --> 46:17.441
I have an audition this week.

46:18.192 --> 46:19.318
You didn't tell me that.

46:19.485 --> 46:20.986
It's not really a big deal.

46:21.945 --> 46:24.198
No spontaneous
trips to grandma's house?

46:24.490 --> 46:25.908
I found a way around that.

46:26.658 --> 46:27.493
How?

46:27.618 --> 46:29.828
I'm not going to tell my mom.

46:30.496 --> 46:31.455
What's the part?

46:31.747 --> 46:32.581
Romeo.

46:36.585 --> 46:37.794
That's a big part.

46:38.712 --> 46:39.838
Sure you can handle that?

46:41.006 --> 46:43.800
Well, you know,
I memorized the speech

46:43.884 --> 46:45.677
but I don't really
know what else to do.

46:48.013 --> 46:48.847
You... show me.

46:52.768 --> 46:53.644
No.

46:54.186 --> 46:55.020
Oh yeah.

46:56.480 --> 46:58.148
After my whole
ordeal with Cole,

46:58.232 --> 47:00.317
you don't think I deserve
some entertainment?

47:02.528 --> 47:03.362
Come on.

47:06.615 --> 47:07.699
Fine.

47:08.700 --> 47:10.327
You and your ways.

47:11.620 --> 47:15.874
Okay, but for tonight's
performance of Romeo and Juliet,

47:16.500 --> 47:18.877
the role of Juliet
will be played

47:18.961 --> 47:23.632
by the lovely and talented
Miss Madison Daniels.

47:23.966 --> 47:24.800
Okay.

47:33.225 --> 47:35.602
Oh, and I figure the scene
is more funny than serious

47:35.686 --> 47:37.604
because he's not like
this big romantic,

47:37.688 --> 47:40.023
he's just horny and wants
to see Juliet's boobs.

47:41.191 --> 47:42.025
Wow.

47:43.235 --> 47:44.278
Okay.

47:49.741 --> 47:50.576
Here goes.

47:57.040 --> 47:58.542
But soft!

47:59.793 --> 48:01.753
What light through
yonder window breaks?

48:04.131 --> 48:05.632
It is the east

48:06.258 --> 48:08.302
and Juliet is the sun.

48:10.345 --> 48:13.724
Arise, fair sun,
and kill the envious moon

48:13.807 --> 48:16.518
who is already sick
and pale with grief

48:16.602 --> 48:20.272
that thou her maid art
far more fair than she!

48:21.565 --> 48:24.318
Be not her maid,
since she is envious!

48:25.110 --> 48:28.071
Her vestal livery
is but sick and green

48:28.155 --> 48:30.157
and none but fools do wear it.

48:33.118 --> 48:34.119
Cast it off!

48:35.120 --> 48:36.288
It is my lady.

48:40.459 --> 48:42.169
It is my love!

48:46.256 --> 48:49.343
See how she leans her
cheek upon her hand.

48:52.387 --> 48:54.765
Oh, but I were a glove
upon that hand

48:56.141 --> 48:58.518
that I might touch that cheek.

49:05.609 --> 49:06.443
That's it.

49:07.486 --> 49:09.112
So did it suck that bad?

49:10.238 --> 49:11.198
No.

49:11.531 --> 49:12.658
That didn't suck.

49:14.076 --> 49:15.410
That didn't suck at all.

49:27.422 --> 49:28.256
It's late.

49:28.340 --> 49:29.466
Why are you calling me?

49:29.633 --> 49:30.676
Were you asleep?

49:31.718 --> 49:32.636
Yeah.

49:33.136 --> 49:34.471
Do you know what time it is?

49:35.430 --> 49:37.516
Well, wake up, because I
have something to show you.

49:40.060 --> 49:42.312
I'm up, I just can't
promise I'll stay up.

49:42.979 --> 49:44.523
I think
I can keep you up.

49:45.565 --> 49:46.608
We'll see.

49:47.275 --> 49:48.485
We will see.

49:52.280 --> 49:53.699
So, what?

49:54.533 --> 49:55.826
T, don't rush me.

49:57.411 --> 49:58.370
Mad, I'm really tired.

49:58.453 --> 49:59.496
I want to go back to bed.

49:59.996 --> 50:00.997
You wish. You're being weird.

50:02.582 --> 50:03.625
Good night.

50:03.709 --> 50:04.876
No, T, wait, wait!

50:04.960 --> 50:06.044
T, give me a sec.

50:07.963 --> 50:09.715
I'm just gonna put my
head down right here.

50:16.012 --> 50:18.932
So I've been thinking.

50:22.310 --> 50:24.771
I've been thinking
a lot about what you said.

50:25.897 --> 50:28.316
Whatever it was,
it sure was brilliant.

50:29.484 --> 50:34.614
How I shouldn't try
to have sex with idiots,

50:35.240 --> 50:36.575
especially Cole.

50:37.159 --> 50:38.827
It's good to be idiot-free.

50:39.578 --> 50:40.412
I agree.

50:44.207 --> 50:46.168
I was also thinking about you.

50:48.545 --> 50:49.504
I'm flattered.

50:50.213 --> 50:54.092
I was thinking
about you a lot.

50:55.051 --> 50:57.721
And how you're not

50:58.054 --> 50:58.930
an idiot.

51:00.307 --> 51:01.141
So... This...

51:08.565 --> 51:09.566
Is for you.

51:11.943 --> 51:14.780
Uh, what are you doing?

51:20.994 --> 51:22.245
Seriously, Mad.

51:22.329 --> 51:23.330
Just enjoy it.

51:28.877 --> 51:29.795
Do you like it?

51:30.378 --> 51:31.213
Uh...

51:32.005 --> 51:33.215
I'll take that as a yes.

51:37.093 --> 51:38.178
Madison, don't.

51:39.054 --> 51:40.263
Don't be a prude.

51:40.430 --> 51:42.140
Mad, Mad, stop, seriously.

51:42.224 --> 51:43.725
This is not,
I'm not watching this!

51:43.809 --> 51:44.976
I'm not watching.

51:45.477 --> 51:46.478
Why not?

51:46.853 --> 51:48.897
Because it's weird
and desperate.

51:48.980 --> 51:50.398
"Weird and desperate"?

51:50.482 --> 51:51.525
Yeah.

51:52.400 --> 51:53.693
You're an ass!

51:53.777 --> 51:54.653
What?

51:54.736 --> 51:56.363
I'm trying to give
you something!

51:56.780 --> 51:58.573
My own personal
internet porn?

51:59.032 --> 52:00.158
Is that what this is?

52:00.450 --> 52:01.952
Well, Mad, that's
what it feels like.

52:02.035 --> 52:03.203
So I disgust you.

52:03.286 --> 52:05.539
No, no, you don't disgust me.

52:05.622 --> 52:06.540
Then what?

52:06.623 --> 52:08.708
We're friends and you
wanna stay friends?

52:09.584 --> 52:11.086
Well, yeah.

52:14.256 --> 52:15.465
- Fuck you.
- Wait.

52:18.343 --> 52:19.177
What?

52:58.425 --> 52:59.301
What?

52:59.593 --> 53:00.552
I'm sorry.

53:00.969 --> 53:01.887
Okay.

53:02.220 --> 53:05.265
I'll hold onto that while
I cry myself to sleep.

53:06.099 --> 53:06.933
I mean it.

53:07.017 --> 53:08.977
I didn't even know
you liked me.

53:10.103 --> 53:11.104
Yeah, right.

53:11.688 --> 53:13.148
Mad, I'm serious.

53:13.231 --> 53:14.357
I figured you'd be out

53:14.441 --> 53:17.193
chasing all
the gorgeous popular guys.

53:17.527 --> 53:19.571
T, you're gorgeous.

53:19.863 --> 53:20.989
No, I'm not.

53:21.281 --> 53:22.532
T, yes, you are.

53:23.074 --> 53:24.034
And you're...

53:24.784 --> 53:25.911
You're sweet.

53:26.661 --> 53:29.080
And you actually
listen to what I say.

53:30.040 --> 53:31.124
What did you expect?

53:32.042 --> 53:32.876
I don't know.

53:33.710 --> 53:35.337
First you
internet stalk me,

53:35.670 --> 53:37.589
then you have all these
deep conversations with me,

53:37.672 --> 53:40.133
then you're all like "You're
beautiful and intelligent

53:40.216 --> 53:41.426
and Cole's an idiot."

53:41.509 --> 53:42.677
He is an idiot.

53:42.928 --> 53:44.304
Yeah, well, you are too.

53:45.972 --> 53:47.140
Yeah, I guess I am.

53:47.557 --> 53:49.225
Then why do I
feel like the idiot?

53:49.726 --> 53:53.438
Look, Mad, I've been
driving around all night

53:53.521 --> 53:55.440
trying to decide whether
to tell you this.

53:55.523 --> 53:56.650
Wait, driving?

53:57.525 --> 53:59.152
My mom's afraid
to practice with me,

53:59.235 --> 54:01.529
so sometimes when I can't
sleep, I take my grandma's car

54:01.613 --> 54:02.614
around the neighborhood.

54:04.324 --> 54:05.158
Rebel.

54:09.287 --> 54:11.039
I don't really like girls.

54:15.210 --> 54:16.419
I'm hanging up now.

54:16.670 --> 54:18.088
No, no, wait,
Mad, I mean it.

54:18.171 --> 54:19.214
You don't get it.

54:20.131 --> 54:21.967
I don't really like
any girls that way.

54:24.094 --> 54:24.928
Because...

54:27.889 --> 54:29.182
Oh, crap.

54:32.310 --> 54:35.230
I like boys.

54:36.523 --> 54:37.357
What? Yeah.

54:40.276 --> 54:44.364
I think I might...
be, you know.

54:48.785 --> 54:50.036
That's convenient.

54:50.120 --> 54:51.621
Mad, I mean it.

54:51.913 --> 54:53.623
You're the first
person I've ever told.

54:54.666 --> 54:55.542
Wait, really?

54:57.460 --> 54:58.294
Really.

54:59.629 --> 55:01.715
I've been wanting to tell you
for like a really long time

55:01.798 --> 55:04.009
but I didn't know when
or how to bring it up.

55:04.926 --> 55:06.511
Well, this was perfect timing.

55:07.303 --> 55:08.304
I'm sorry. Are you...

55:11.057 --> 55:12.058
Are you sure?

55:12.726 --> 55:15.061
I'm not really
sure about anything.

55:15.979 --> 55:17.105
Then how do you know?

55:18.273 --> 55:21.484
Well, I mean,
there aren't really girls

55:21.568 --> 55:24.696
that I think about more than
any others except for you.

55:24.779 --> 55:27.157
But then I just think
about, you know,

55:27.240 --> 55:29.701
what we're going to talk about
next time we see each other.

55:29.951 --> 55:31.786
Not other stuff.

55:32.871 --> 55:34.289
Do you think about

55:35.373 --> 55:37.167
other stuff with boys?

55:37.375 --> 55:40.503
Yeah, kind of...
all the time.

55:41.755 --> 55:42.589
Oh.

55:43.673 --> 55:44.966
Like...

55:45.258 --> 55:46.217
you know.

55:46.634 --> 55:47.469
Sonny.

55:48.470 --> 55:49.596
Wait, him?

55:50.764 --> 55:51.723
Yeah.

55:52.265 --> 55:53.141
Him.

55:53.808 --> 55:54.851
A lot.

55:56.102 --> 55:57.520
I can see why.

55:58.521 --> 56:01.566
Me and him used to be such
good friends when we were kids.

56:02.067 --> 56:03.943
But then we both
changed so much

56:04.027 --> 56:05.820
and he became really
good at sports

56:07.489 --> 56:10.575
and I became really good
at watching him play sports.

56:14.287 --> 56:15.121
T.

56:16.456 --> 56:17.916
Is this why they beat you up?

56:19.250 --> 56:20.126
Yeah.

56:20.877 --> 56:22.712
Well, yes and no.

56:23.421 --> 56:24.506
What do you mean?

56:25.757 --> 56:27.383
Well, it was because of Sonny.

56:28.051 --> 56:29.302
Wait, he beat you up?

56:29.719 --> 56:31.971
No, no, no, no,
it was his friends.

56:32.555 --> 56:33.598
He didn't.

56:34.766 --> 56:35.892
W- Well...

56:39.562 --> 56:42.190
You remember when he
came over to my house

56:42.273 --> 56:43.691
after I helped him cheat?

56:44.526 --> 56:45.652
You said you didn't.

56:46.736 --> 56:48.863
Yeah, that's what I said.

56:49.656 --> 56:50.532
Okay.

56:51.324 --> 56:54.744
Well, ice cream with my
mom was perfectly...

56:55.245 --> 56:56.246
awkward.

56:57.038 --> 56:59.666
But then we started talking
about this card game

56:59.749 --> 57:02.085
that we used to play
when we were kids, Magic?

57:03.086 --> 57:05.630
And it turned out,

57:05.922 --> 57:07.674
that he was still
really bummed

57:07.757 --> 57:11.469
about this card he traded
me, like, years ago.

57:12.178 --> 57:14.305
And so I told him
that I still had it.

57:14.722 --> 57:16.808
And we went up to my room

57:17.642 --> 57:19.185
and I gave it back to him.

57:20.937 --> 57:23.690
And then we started looking
at all the other cards

57:25.692 --> 57:27.318
and kind of looking at each one

57:27.652 --> 57:29.779
and reliving some
of our old battles.

57:32.449 --> 57:36.619
And then I honestly don't
know how it happened

57:37.829 --> 57:39.247
but there was this, like,

57:40.498 --> 57:43.209
tingly electric gravity

57:43.293 --> 57:46.296
between us and it
kept pulling us closer

57:46.379 --> 57:47.964
and closer together.

57:49.299 --> 57:52.760
And then suddenly
we were kissing.

57:55.138 --> 57:58.850
I know, I was, like,
shocked too.

58:00.101 --> 58:02.937
It was literally like
every fantasy I ever had

58:03.021 --> 58:06.608
was coming true in one
simultaneous moment.

58:07.984 --> 58:11.029
And so we kept kissing
for like five minutes

58:11.112 --> 58:13.114
and then, you know,

58:13.198 --> 58:14.908
both of us getting
more and more into it.

58:16.367 --> 58:19.579
And then really suddenly,
he pulled away.

58:19.662 --> 58:20.622
Like super abruptly.

58:21.498 --> 58:23.833
And he got out of there as fast as he could.
He didn't say anything to me as he was leaving,

58:26.920 --> 58:30.256
but, Mad, for those
five minutes,

58:31.216 --> 58:33.092
it was like magic.

58:33.801 --> 58:34.636
T!

58:37.639 --> 58:39.098
So what happened though?

58:40.016 --> 58:42.143
He completely ignored
me the next day at school,

58:42.519 --> 58:43.728
so I tried texting him.

58:43.811 --> 58:46.773
But he was just like "Who is
this, how'd you get my number?"

58:48.024 --> 58:52.237
So, I mustered up the courage
to go talk to him after school.

58:56.824 --> 58:59.244
Well, I wasn't
gonna show you this,

59:01.913 --> 59:02.914
but whatever.

59:04.415 --> 59:05.250
Here.

59:12.298 --> 59:14.300
<i>Hey, Mad, I know you're
in school right now</i>

59:14.384 --> 59:16.302
<i>but I wanted to show
you my latest triumph.</i>

59:16.928 --> 59:19.514
<i>I think I'm gonna go try
to talk to Sonny again.</i>

59:23.142 --> 59:24.227
<i>Wish me luck.</i>

59:38.575 --> 59:39.409
<i>Hey. Hey.</i>

59:42.996 --> 59:44.497
<i>So biology sucked today, huh?</i>

59:46.207 --> 59:47.041
<i>Yeah.</i>

59:49.586 --> 59:50.962
<i>Listen, I gotta go.</i>

59:51.045 --> 59:52.463
<i>I was actually
wondering if maybe we could...</i>

59:52.547 --> 59:54.799
<i>Hey, that that fag
you were talking about?</i>

59:56.718 --> 59:57.552
<i>Yeah.</i>

59:57.969 --> 59:59.887
<i>I don't know what he wants,
but he's not gonna find it here.</i>

59:59.971 --> 01:00:01.264
<i>- I think I know what he wants.
- Can we go somewhere and talk?</i>

01:00:03.057 --> 01:00:04.183
<i>We have nothing to talk about.</i>

01:00:04.642 --> 01:00:06.019
<i>- I just was...
- Whoa!</i>

01:00:06.144 --> 01:00:06.978
<i>Get away!</i>

01:00:07.645 --> 01:00:08.605
<i>Get away, assbag.</i>

01:00:08.896 --> 01:00:09.897
<i>Get off of me!</i>

01:00:10.148 --> 01:00:11.065
<i>That was a mistake.</i>

01:00:11.357 --> 01:00:12.358
<i>Get off!</i>

01:00:12.984 --> 01:00:14.485
<i>Like that?</i>

01:00:17.071 --> 01:00:20.992
<i>Oh, Sonny, Sonny,
I want you so bad!</i>

01:00:32.253 --> 01:00:33.087
T. Yeah.

01:00:37.258 --> 01:00:39.052
T, I can't believe they would do that.
Is this gonna be weird now?

01:00:44.724 --> 01:00:45.558
Us? Yeah.

01:00:47.185 --> 01:00:48.144
No, T.

01:00:48.770 --> 01:00:50.313
Yeah, it's gonna
be totally weird.

01:00:50.396 --> 01:00:51.898
This is why I didn't tell
you for so long, Mad,

01:00:51.981 --> 01:00:53.733
because I knew things
would get all weird.

01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:55.151
No.

01:00:55.234 --> 01:00:56.444
No, they're not weird.

01:00:56.986 --> 01:00:58.988
Yeah, well, if you say so.

01:00:59.739 --> 01:01:01.115
T, I'm serious.

01:01:01.741 --> 01:01:03.284
You gotta give me a break.

01:01:03.368 --> 01:01:05.620
I just found out tonight
while I was in my underwear.

01:01:15.254 --> 01:01:16.923
T, wake up.
I have an idea.

01:01:17.131 --> 01:01:18.424
Don't you ever sleep?

01:01:18.966 --> 01:01:22.303
What if you start a gay-straight
alliance at your school?

01:01:22.970 --> 01:01:23.805
No way.

01:01:25.098 --> 01:01:26.766
I looked and there
aren't any in your area.

01:01:26.849 --> 01:01:28.726
You could connect to other
gay kids at your school.

01:01:28.810 --> 01:01:30.353
You could maybe
even help them out.

01:01:30.978 --> 01:01:32.605
Yeah, help them get
the crap kicked out of them.

01:01:33.147 --> 01:01:34.732
No, T, that's
the whole point of GSA,

01:01:34.816 --> 01:01:35.983
so that wouldn't happen.

01:01:36.317 --> 01:01:38.027
I'm sorry, not interested.

01:01:39.070 --> 01:01:40.279
T, you need support.

01:01:40.947 --> 01:01:43.825
Look, I really appreciate
what you're trying to do

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:46.536
but I'm not ready for that.

01:01:48.079 --> 01:01:49.956
T, you can't just
sit there and suffer.

01:01:50.915 --> 01:01:51.874
All by yourself. Yeah, I can.

01:01:54.669 --> 01:01:56.462
No, T, you need to
tell someone.

01:01:57.004 --> 01:01:58.005
I did.

01:01:58.089 --> 01:01:59.549
No, someone other than me.

01:01:59.632 --> 01:02:01.551
People need to know
so that they can help you.

01:02:01.884 --> 01:02:03.052
They're the ones
who need help. Fine.

01:02:04.762 --> 01:02:06.597
Fine, then make
them deal with you.

01:02:06.681 --> 01:02:08.683
Mad, stop pushing me, okay?

01:02:08.933 --> 01:02:10.226
I'm not pushing you.

01:02:10.309 --> 01:02:12.270
I don't want to be your
cause anymore.

01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:14.605
You're not my cause,
you're my friend.

01:02:14.814 --> 01:02:16.691
Then stop
friending me so hard.

01:02:17.316 --> 01:02:20.236
T, just look at the
website I'm sending to you.

01:02:26.951 --> 01:02:29.120
You just posted
that on my wall.

01:02:30.037 --> 01:02:31.038
So what?

01:02:31.122 --> 01:02:33.124
So now everyone's
gonna think I'm gay.

01:02:33.291 --> 01:02:34.959
No, T,
it's just a link.

01:02:35.042 --> 01:02:37.420
It's a link
to a gay website, Mad!

01:02:38.212 --> 01:02:39.964
It's for straight people too.

01:02:40.214 --> 01:02:42.258
You don't, you don't
send that to someone

01:02:42.341 --> 01:02:43.801
unless you
think they're gay!

01:02:44.177 --> 01:02:45.386
You are gay.

01:02:45.470 --> 01:02:47.847
Well, I'm sorry if I don't
want to flaunt my sexuality

01:02:47.930 --> 01:02:49.849
all over the internet
like some people I know.

01:02:51.392 --> 01:02:52.977
Why are you being such a jerk?

01:02:53.478 --> 01:02:56.105
Because you just outed
me to all my friends!

01:02:56.439 --> 01:02:57.732
What friends, T?

01:02:58.983 --> 01:03:01.152
You have like 78
acquaintances on Facebook

01:03:01.235 --> 01:03:02.111
who don't even see your feed

01:03:02.195 --> 01:03:03.613
because you
don't post anything.

01:03:08.493 --> 01:03:09.327
T.

01:06:17.848 --> 01:06:20.643
<i>Here we are at my dad's retirement party.
Wow, look at those amazing decorations.</i>

01:06:24.063 --> 01:06:25.982
<i>Aren't they incredible?
Oh, but the cake.</i>

01:06:26.482 --> 01:06:28.693
<i>Oh yeah, the cake, yummy.</i>

01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:30.319
<i>I wonder who made it?</i>

01:06:31.070 --> 01:06:32.822
<i>Shh, I won't
tell if you don't.</i>

01:06:33.614 --> 01:06:35.700
<i>Obviously, all these
people are here</i>

01:06:35.783 --> 01:06:38.661
<i>because of my expertly
designed invitations.</i>

01:06:38.744 --> 01:06:40.913
<i>Well, almost everybody.</i>

01:06:40.997 --> 01:06:42.957
<i>I wish my friend
Teel was here.</i>

01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:45.209
<i>But we can't have
it all now, can we?</i>

01:07:55.362 --> 01:07:56.363
Hey.

01:08:11.545 --> 01:08:13.047
What's with the cards?

01:08:27.269 --> 01:08:28.104
Okay.

01:08:36.821 --> 01:08:37.822
It's all right.

01:08:41.783 --> 01:08:43.160
There's a smudge on that one.

01:08:54.546 --> 01:08:56.506
Mad, you don't
need to be fixed.

01:09:14.066 --> 01:09:16.569
Mad, really, it's all right.

01:09:20.906 --> 01:09:21.740
Yeah. Yeah.

01:09:32.459 --> 01:09:34.044
You used to make me
climb around the back

01:09:34.127 --> 01:09:36.796
because supposedly
the front was being guarded.

01:09:37.339 --> 01:09:39.716
I'd get all these
scratches all over my arms

01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:40.718
from the bark.

01:09:51.060 --> 01:09:51.895
Me too.

01:09:55.441 --> 01:09:56.525
Yeah, I know.

01:10:27.097 --> 01:10:28.182
What do you mean?

01:10:36.607 --> 01:10:37.942
Maddie, it's almost nine!

01:10:38.651 --> 01:10:39.610
Okay, Daddy!

01:10:41.570 --> 01:10:42.780
Wait, what
are you talking about?

01:10:44.573 --> 01:10:45.574
Keep watching what?

01:10:49.620 --> 01:10:50.663
Madison.

01:10:52.581 --> 01:10:53.999
Okay, I promise.

01:11:04.927 --> 01:11:07.012
You're kinda starting
to freak me out.

01:11:08.555 --> 01:11:09.515
Madison.

01:11:10.057 --> 01:11:10.891
Madison!

01:13:34.827 --> 01:13:36.912
Okay, okay.

01:13:47.548 --> 01:13:48.382
Stop. Stop.

01:14:22.124 --> 01:14:24.585
Hi, I'd like to report a crime.

01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:39.892
You shouldn't have done that.

01:14:39.975 --> 01:14:40.976
Are you okay?

01:14:41.059 --> 01:14:42.102
What happened,
did the cops come?

01:14:42.186 --> 01:14:43.729
Did they arrest him?

01:14:44.354 --> 01:14:45.481
Yeah, they came.

01:14:45.564 --> 01:14:46.732
And my dad cleared things up.

01:14:46.815 --> 01:14:48.192
It was all a misunderstanding.

01:14:48.650 --> 01:14:50.068
What do you mean,
cleared it up?

01:14:50.194 --> 01:14:51.153
Didn't you tell them?

01:14:51.528 --> 01:14:53.363
I told them
that I made it up.

01:14:53.655 --> 01:14:54.573
What?

01:14:55.157 --> 01:14:59.620
T, I don't think we should
be talking anymore, okay?

01:15:00.412 --> 01:15:01.538
Madison, what the hell?

01:15:02.122 --> 01:15:04.041
I have to be there
for my dad right now.

01:15:04.374 --> 01:15:05.876
He's going through
a lot, so...

01:15:05.959 --> 01:15:06.793
No, no, Madison.

01:15:06.877 --> 01:15:08.045
You need to do something.

01:15:08.212 --> 01:15:09.505
Good luck with the show.

01:15:10.047 --> 01:15:11.215
Wait, Madison!

01:15:11.298 --> 01:15:12.132
Madison!

01:15:19.097 --> 01:15:20.474
Alack, there lies more peril...

01:15:21.058 --> 01:15:22.100
Alack, there lies more...

01:15:22.309 --> 01:15:24.603
Alack, there lies more
peril in thine eye...

01:15:57.636 --> 01:15:58.720
- Hey, sweetie.
- Mom.

01:15:58.804 --> 01:15:59.846
Sorry, knock knock.

01:15:59.930 --> 01:16:01.056
You need a ride to rehearsal?

01:16:01.139 --> 01:16:02.683
No, Karina and Sydney
are picking me up.

01:16:03.016 --> 01:16:05.185
Also I think everyone's
going to go out afterwards,

01:16:05.269 --> 01:16:06.478
so I might be home late.

01:16:08.105 --> 01:16:10.566
You know, grandma's coming
to your opening tomorrow.

01:16:10.774 --> 01:16:11.608
Okay.

01:16:12.818 --> 01:16:14.152
I'm very proud of you.

01:16:14.278 --> 01:16:15.946
Mom, gotta run my lines.

01:16:16.029 --> 01:16:17.030
Okay, I'm going.

01:16:25.831 --> 01:16:30.043
Alack, there
lies more peril in thine eye

01:16:30.752 --> 01:16:32.212
than in 20 of their swords.

01:17:00.949 --> 01:17:02.951
<i>Obviously all
these people are here</i>

01:17:03.035 --> 01:17:06.121
<i>because of my expertly
designed invitations.</i>

01:17:06.246 --> 01:17:08.415
<i>Well, almost everybody.</i>

01:17:08.498 --> 01:17:10.250
<i>I wish my friend Teel was here.</i>

01:17:10.334 --> 01:17:11.793
<i>But...</i>

01:17:12.669 --> 01:17:14.588
<i>I wish my friend Teel was here.</i>

01:17:15.172 --> 01:17:17.215
<i>I wish my friend Teel was here.</i>

01:17:17.299 --> 01:17:19.384
<i>But we can't have
it all now, can we?</i>

01:18:04.471 --> 01:18:05.389
Hey, Mad!

01:18:06.181 --> 01:18:08.725
Right now I am on the run.

01:18:10.352 --> 01:18:13.480
I stole my grandma's car
and a bunch of money

01:18:13.563 --> 01:18:14.981
from my dad's sock drawer

01:18:15.065 --> 01:18:17.067
and I told my director
a whole story

01:18:17.150 --> 01:18:18.944
about having, like,
a dire family emergency

01:18:19.027 --> 01:18:20.112
and he bought the whole thing.

01:18:20.195 --> 01:18:21.905
It turns out I'm
a pretty good actor.

01:18:22.698 --> 01:18:24.950
And now here
I am on the road.

01:18:25.951 --> 01:18:29.079
I know
it's a little bit extreme,

01:18:30.706 --> 01:18:31.998
but you're not taking my calls.

01:18:33.667 --> 01:18:34.835
So California here I come.

01:18:39.172 --> 01:18:41.591
Apparently there are nothing
but trees in Illinois.

01:18:43.176 --> 01:18:44.302
Oh, look, a field.

01:18:48.807 --> 01:18:49.808
I guess that's
the end of that...

01:18:49.891 --> 01:18:51.351
Oh my god, a field!

01:18:52.978 --> 01:18:54.062
Mad, if you don't pick up,

01:18:54.146 --> 01:18:56.022
I'm gonna be forced
to do something drastic.

01:19:00.235 --> 01:19:02.112
Oh man, it's so pretty.

01:19:03.572 --> 01:19:06.158
Hey, Mad, really wish you
would talk to me right now.

01:19:06.241 --> 01:19:08.034
I'm trying to stay
awake over here.

01:19:11.121 --> 01:19:13.373
Nothing a caffeinated
beverage can't fix.

01:19:21.381 --> 01:19:23.258
Oh, it's my mom.

01:19:24.551 --> 01:19:25.594
She's probably freaking out.

01:19:25.677 --> 01:19:27.262
I bet she's called
the cops like three times.

01:19:28.263 --> 01:19:30.766
This could be
a very pointless trip.

01:19:36.062 --> 01:19:38.982
Nineteen messages from
my mom, six from my dad.

01:19:39.065 --> 01:19:40.609
And yes, they have
called the cops,

01:19:40.692 --> 01:19:41.777
so congratulations, Mad.

01:19:41.860 --> 01:19:43.737
You've officially turned
me into a fugitive.

01:19:44.196 --> 01:19:45.238
Morning, Mad!

01:19:45.655 --> 01:19:46.823
I hope you're seeing this.

01:19:48.325 --> 01:19:50.243
I never knew it would
be so beautiful.

01:20:16.228 --> 01:20:17.062
Hey, Mad.

01:20:17.145 --> 01:20:18.355
Just got here.

01:20:18.438 --> 01:20:21.233
The GPS sent me on kind
of a wild goose chase

01:20:21.316 --> 01:20:23.401
and then I realized that
you're on South Maple

01:20:23.485 --> 01:20:26.071
and not North Maple, and those
are very different addresses.

01:20:27.155 --> 01:20:28.156
Oh, you're calling me.

01:20:29.032 --> 01:20:30.742
- Guess where I am right now...
- T, you shouldn't have come here!

01:20:31.409 --> 01:20:32.369
Go home!

01:20:32.911 --> 01:20:34.120
I figured you
might say that, but...

01:20:34.204 --> 01:20:35.831
My dad is right downstairs!

01:20:36.164 --> 01:20:37.833
Don't worry,
I'm coming around the back.

01:20:45.507 --> 01:20:46.633
What are you doing?

01:20:46.716 --> 01:20:47.717
I'm coming up. No!

01:20:48.885 --> 01:20:49.719
T!

01:20:51.429 --> 01:20:52.389
Oh my god.

01:20:53.181 --> 01:20:54.641
Oh my god, T, no.

01:20:54.933 --> 01:20:55.767
T! No!

01:21:02.107 --> 01:21:02.941
Shh!

01:21:03.024 --> 01:21:04.150
Oh my god, T.

01:21:06.278 --> 01:21:07.487
T, no way.

01:21:08.572 --> 01:21:10.031
T, you're gonna kill yourself.

01:21:10.115 --> 01:21:10.949
What else is new?

01:21:11.032 --> 01:21:12.909
Oh my god, no.

01:21:14.119 --> 01:21:15.036
Hey.

01:21:15.328 --> 01:21:16.913
If my dad sees you,
he will kill you.

01:21:16.997 --> 01:21:18.665
Alack, there lies
more peril in thine eye

01:21:18.748 --> 01:21:20.959
- than in 20 of their swords.
- You have to leave.

01:21:21.042 --> 01:21:22.711
Oh, will thou leave
me so unsatisfied?

01:21:22.794 --> 01:21:23.712
What do you want?

01:21:23.795 --> 01:21:25.964
The exchange of thy love's
faithful vow from mine.

01:21:26.047 --> 01:21:27.048
Maddie?

01:21:28.008 --> 01:21:29.467
I'll be right down, Dad!

01:21:31.303 --> 01:21:32.888
I had to see you in person.

01:21:32.971 --> 01:21:33.847
No, T.

01:21:34.389 --> 01:21:36.224
I already told you that I
can't talk to you anymore.

01:21:36.308 --> 01:21:37.976
No, we can go to the police
again and tell them everything.

01:21:38.059 --> 01:21:39.811
No, they won't believe me, no.

01:21:39.895 --> 01:21:40.812
- They'll believe me.
- No.

01:21:40.896 --> 01:21:42.272
- I'll be with you the whole time.
- I said no.

01:21:42.397 --> 01:21:43.273
Why?

01:21:44.107 --> 01:21:44.941
Madison.

01:21:46.192 --> 01:21:48.403
Look, he's not a monster, okay?

01:21:48.486 --> 01:21:50.322
- Yes, he is.
- No, he's not, you don't know him!

01:21:50.405 --> 01:21:52.115
- You don't know him!
- Okay, okay. Okay, okay, Mad.

01:21:52.198 --> 01:21:53.700
- No, I can't. I...
- Mad, Mad, okay.

01:21:53.783 --> 01:21:54.910
I can't, okay?

01:21:55.368 --> 01:21:58.204
I can't turn him in, I can't.

01:21:58.288 --> 01:22:00.081
I just need you to come with
me so we can find some help.

01:22:00.165 --> 01:22:02.584
No. He will send the National
Guard, you don't get it.

01:22:02.667 --> 01:22:04.002
He shouldn't be
doing that to you.

01:22:04.085 --> 01:22:06.338
Better that I learn from him

01:22:06.421 --> 01:22:09.716
than some jerk off boy
who doesn't love me!

01:22:09.799 --> 01:22:11.593
- He doesn't love you.
- Yes, he does!

01:22:12.594 --> 01:22:14.179
Do you remember
how you helped me?

01:22:15.722 --> 01:22:17.390
When I didn't have any friends?

01:22:17.974 --> 01:22:18.934
You remember that?

01:22:19.309 --> 01:22:21.728
Now I have
142 Facebook friends.

01:22:21.853 --> 01:22:24.439
Mad, can you believe that?

01:22:25.398 --> 01:22:27.442
I never could have been
able to do that without you.

01:22:30.070 --> 01:22:31.613
Do you know what
I was doing on the first night

01:22:31.696 --> 01:22:32.614
that I called you?

01:22:34.032 --> 01:22:35.700
I was planning
to commit suicide.

01:22:37.661 --> 01:22:40.538
Right after you left, I took an
entire bottle of acetaminophen.

01:22:42.165 --> 01:22:43.458
And then you called back.

01:22:44.250 --> 01:22:45.168
You remember that?

01:22:46.002 --> 01:22:47.462
You called me back
from the party

01:22:47.545 --> 01:22:50.340
because you thought
I was lonely or something.

01:22:51.549 --> 01:22:52.425
And then,

01:22:52.717 --> 01:22:55.470
suddenly I had one
friend and that was enough.

01:22:56.429 --> 01:22:57.931
T, I had no idea.

01:22:58.098 --> 01:23:00.850
Well, I didn't want you
to know that it was that bad.

01:23:01.017 --> 01:23:03.520
I was mostly just
so amazed that you,

01:23:03.603 --> 01:23:05.814
this beautiful, brave, smart girl wanted
to talk to me.

01:23:09.901 --> 01:23:11.820
You helped me so much.

01:23:12.821 --> 01:23:14.447
It's okay to need help.

01:23:15.782 --> 01:23:17.617
142 Facebook friends?

01:23:17.701 --> 01:23:18.910
Acquaintances.

01:23:20.453 --> 01:23:22.122
I wish we'd made it to 150.

01:23:24.833 --> 01:23:25.750
We gotta go.

01:23:27.961 --> 01:23:29.504
Maddie, what's going on
in there?

01:23:30.296 --> 01:23:32.007
Nothing, Dad.

01:23:32.090 --> 01:23:33.383
Why's the door locked?
- It's locked?

01:23:33.466 --> 01:23:34.509
You gotta
come with me, Mad.

01:23:34.718 --> 01:23:35.885
- I can't.
- Madison,

01:23:35.969 --> 01:23:37.012
- is there a boy in there?
- Yes, you can.

01:23:37.345 --> 01:23:38.888
No, Dad, no!

01:23:38.972 --> 01:23:40.724
Open the goddamn door!

01:23:41.057 --> 01:23:42.517
- He's gonna kill you.
- I'm not afraid.

01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:43.435
Madison!

01:23:43.518 --> 01:23:44.978
Dad, stop, please!

01:23:45.270 --> 01:23:46.896
- Oh my god.
- Open this door immediately.

01:23:46.980 --> 01:23:48.690
- No, I can't go. I can't do this.
- You can do this.

01:23:48.773 --> 01:23:49.816
It's okay.

01:23:49.899 --> 01:23:50.734
You can.

01:23:51.693 --> 01:23:52.527
No, T.

01:23:52.610 --> 01:23:53.653
You're my best friend.

01:23:56.072 --> 01:23:57.699
Madison!

01:24:07.125 --> 01:24:07.959
Hey. Hi.

01:24:09.586 --> 01:24:10.462
How you doing?

01:24:11.921 --> 01:24:12.839
I'm okay.

01:24:14.424 --> 01:24:17.469
Today's been one
of the better days.

01:24:18.178 --> 01:24:19.012
Good. Yeah.

01:24:20.346 --> 01:24:21.389
How's your audition?

01:24:22.390 --> 01:24:27.187
Some are born great,
some achieve greatness,

01:24:27.562 --> 01:24:30.899
and some have greatness
thrust upon them.

01:24:30.982 --> 01:24:32.776
You are such a drama queen.

01:24:34.110 --> 01:24:35.320
Hey, where are you right now?

01:24:36.029 --> 01:24:36.863
Don't be nosy.

01:24:38.823 --> 01:24:39.783
Close your eyes.

01:24:41.284 --> 01:24:42.243
Why?

01:24:42.911 --> 01:24:43.828
Just close your eyes.

01:24:45.288 --> 01:24:46.122
Okay. Tada!

01:25:07.018 --> 01:25:07.977
What is it?

01:25:08.394 --> 01:25:09.562
What does it look like?

01:25:10.688 --> 01:25:11.523
It's a cape.

01:25:13.900 --> 01:25:15.819
Oh my god.

01:25:15.985 --> 01:25:17.320
That is amazing.

01:25:17.612 --> 01:25:19.114
Where were you
when I was seven?

01:25:21.324 --> 01:25:22.158
T.

01:25:23.660 --> 01:25:26.371
I... just wanted
to say thank you.

01:25:27.789 --> 01:25:28.915
To you and your parents

01:25:29.749 --> 01:25:32.752
for being there for me
these past few months, I...

01:25:33.211 --> 01:25:34.420
through the courts and... Mad, you don't
have to say that.

01:25:35.797 --> 01:25:36.881
Just let me finish. You saved me.

01:25:45.723 --> 01:25:47.058
You're my Man of Teel.

01:25:49.435 --> 01:25:50.478
Mad.

01:25:51.855 --> 01:25:53.815
I don't know what to say.

01:25:53.898 --> 01:25:54.774
Don't say anything.

01:25:56.943 --> 01:25:58.778
Just... pose.

01:26:08.037 --> 01:26:09.455
- Oh no.
- No!

01:26:10.290 --> 01:26:11.916
You're not actually
gonna post that, are you?

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:12.834
No.

01:26:14.294 --> 01:26:15.712
This one's just for us.
