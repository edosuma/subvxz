00:01.610 --> 00:03.003
<i>Previously on</i> Will Trent...

00:03.003 --> 00:04.569
I can't believe you have
a college-aged son.

00:04.569 --> 00:06.006
- How old are you?
- How old is your mom?

00:06.006 --> 00:07.572
You are 18 years old.

00:07.572 --> 00:09.357
That is not even close to old
enough to be in this club.

00:09.357 --> 00:11.141
Weren't you doing a lot worse?
I mean, you had a kid!

00:11.141 --> 00:13.187
I've known you
your entire life.

00:13.187 --> 00:15.015
I have high expectations
for you.

00:15.015 --> 00:17.582
Jeremy's grown now.
What's your next move?

00:17.582 --> 00:19.410
Why is the Georgia
Bureau of Investigation

00:19.410 --> 00:21.021
getting involved
in a homicide?

00:21.021 --> 00:22.674
Victim's grandfather's
a billionaire.

00:22.674 --> 00:24.502
He called the governor,
who then called me.

00:24.502 --> 00:26.374
Oh. The governor.
That's right.

00:26.374 --> 00:29.855
You have
an unreasonable boss, too.

00:29.855 --> 00:33.076
That's your new dog walker.
Nico. Sweet kid. Runaway.

00:33.076 --> 00:35.687
You're here because someone
sold you to that freak.

00:35.687 --> 00:37.341
I can help you.

00:37.341 --> 00:38.690
Hey, what was that
tattoo your girl had on her?

00:38.690 --> 00:40.605
That's Zero Mile.
That's the trafficking ring

00:40.605 --> 00:42.346
that Vice has been after
for years.

00:42.346 --> 00:44.435
This girl's my shot.

00:44.435 --> 00:46.046
I know that I can get her
to turn witness.

00:48.613 --> 00:50.441
Just leave it!
We gotta go!

00:50.441 --> 00:51.790
Oh, my God!
Please hurry!

00:58.406 --> 01:01.104
What about your mom's?
Come on. We can go there.

01:01.104 --> 01:02.801
We're not getting her
involved in this!

01:02.801 --> 01:05.239
We're not getting anyone else
involved in this!

01:06.718 --> 01:07.763
Hide.

01:15.597 --> 01:17.860
Oh, come on. Please.

01:18.991 --> 01:20.123
Please.

01:29.437 --> 01:31.221
The Governor's been on my ass

01:31.221 --> 01:33.223
to-- to buy you
a steak and martini,

01:33.223 --> 01:36.226
ever since your team solved
the Campano kidnapping.

01:36.226 --> 01:38.402
Not necessary,
but always appreciated.

01:41.144 --> 01:45.322
Amanda, would you ask me
about the damn rumor already?

01:45.322 --> 01:47.194
Fine. What is it?

01:49.544 --> 01:50.371
I'm retiring.

01:51.981 --> 01:54.201
And I think you should be
my replacement.

01:58.205 --> 02:00.946
Wow. I'm honored.

02:00.946 --> 02:02.078
And I agree.

02:03.645 --> 02:06.996
Statewide Director of the GBI
is, uh, a beast of a gig.

02:06.996 --> 02:08.780
No time for field work

02:08.780 --> 02:11.653
and more handshakes
with Georgia's elite.

02:13.481 --> 02:15.657
Handshakes
won't be a problem, sir.

02:17.876 --> 02:18.964
<i>Salut.</i>

02:31.238 --> 02:33.805
Why are you still here?
It's late.

02:33.805 --> 02:35.155
We were having fun.

02:36.504 --> 02:38.506
At least one of us was.

02:38.506 --> 02:39.855
[sighs] All right.

02:41.117 --> 02:43.293
Where's the mozzarella
that was in here?

02:43.293 --> 02:44.642
Oh.

02:44.642 --> 02:47.297
Betty and I played a game
called "find the cheese"

02:47.297 --> 02:48.994
where I hide
a piece of cheese

02:48.994 --> 02:51.562
somewhere in the house
and Betty finds it,

02:51.562 --> 02:54.304
and if she doesn't find it,
I eat it.

02:54.304 --> 02:57.220
Oh. Guess I'm not having
my caprese pasta.

02:57.220 --> 02:58.917
But I'll make a--
I don't know--

02:58.917 --> 03:00.354
carrot and farro salad,
I guess.

03:00.354 --> 03:01.833
Oh. Uh...

03:01.833 --> 03:03.879
After we played
find the cheese,

03:03.879 --> 03:05.489
I got worried
she'd get diarrhea,

03:05.489 --> 03:07.491
so we played
"find the carrot."

03:07.491 --> 03:11.060
Okay. Thai takeout.
You want to stay?

03:11.060 --> 03:14.672
I'm pretty full from all
the cheese and carrots.

03:14.672 --> 03:15.717
See you tomorrow.

03:24.856 --> 03:26.554
Okay, then.

03:27.468 --> 03:29.034
- I'm not co-signing this.
- Why not?!

03:29.034 --> 03:32.037
Oh, I don't know, because
wandering around Mexico

03:32.037 --> 03:33.691
taking a semester off
to smoke pot is just--

03:33.691 --> 03:35.040
I'm studying
coral reefs.

03:35.040 --> 03:37.869
Oh. Pah! Okay, yeah.
Coral reefer.

03:37.869 --> 03:40.698
You are supposed to be
going to college.

03:40.698 --> 03:42.700
Do you have any idea
how hard it is to save,

03:42.700 --> 03:43.962
as a single mother--

03:45.747 --> 03:46.922
Did you hear that?

03:46.922 --> 03:48.358
I don't know.

03:53.929 --> 03:55.060
What are you doing
with that?

03:55.060 --> 03:56.453
I'm helping.

04:06.420 --> 04:08.073
- Don't move!
- No, no, no!

04:08.073 --> 04:09.249
Don't shoot
don't shoot, don't shoot!

04:09.249 --> 04:11.729
Charles?!
What the hell?!

04:11.729 --> 04:13.253
Dad?

04:13.253 --> 04:14.993
Faith, I'm being followed.

04:14.993 --> 04:16.604
I need your help.

04:20.303 --> 04:22.262
Look, I'm-- I'm sorry
for letting myself in.

04:22.262 --> 04:24.264
I didn't want to risk
waiting outside.

04:24.264 --> 04:26.744
And you still keep your key
in the-- the rafters, so...

04:26.744 --> 04:28.833
So you think
you're being followed?

04:28.833 --> 04:31.271
Yeah. I first noticed the car
a couple days ago.

04:31.271 --> 04:32.794
It was a silver Lexus.

04:32.794 --> 04:34.317
But this morning,
it passed by me three times.

04:34.317 --> 04:36.276
Are you sure they weren't
just looking for parking?

04:36.276 --> 04:39.191
Faith, the same car was outside
my work when I got off,

04:39.191 --> 04:40.845
and then
it followed me home.

04:40.845 --> 04:42.934
Charles, why would somebody
be following you?

04:42.934 --> 04:44.458
I don't know!

04:44.458 --> 04:46.198
Okay. Did you get
a plate number?

04:46.198 --> 04:47.417
No, it didn't have plates.

04:47.417 --> 04:49.114
- That's pretty creepy.
- Shh.

04:49.114 --> 04:50.855
And then someone tried
to reset the password

04:50.855 --> 04:52.422
on my e-mail account, too.

04:52.422 --> 04:53.641
Yeah, that happens to me
about once a month.

04:55.643 --> 04:57.906
You think I'm crazy, don't you?

05:00.256 --> 05:02.127
Are you taking your meds?

05:02.127 --> 05:05.174
Yes. And I've been going to
my veterans group twice a week.

05:05.174 --> 05:06.871
Maybe I am crazy.
I don't know.

05:06.871 --> 05:08.351
But tonight I saw
the same car parked

05:08.351 --> 05:10.005
a block away
from my place!

05:11.572 --> 05:15.793
Faith, you're the most
sane person I've ever met.

05:15.793 --> 05:18.318
Please, if you take a look
and it's nothing,

05:18.318 --> 05:20.320
we can go get
an emergency prescription

05:20.320 --> 05:21.973
of antipsychotics
right now.

05:21.973 --> 05:23.540
Please.

05:23.540 --> 05:25.542
And you're still working
at the hotel?

05:25.542 --> 05:27.892
Yes. The Cavinridge.
Five years this May.

05:31.418 --> 05:33.898
Okay. We'll swing by your place
and check it out.

05:33.898 --> 05:35.160
Okay.

05:35.160 --> 05:36.988
- Not you.
- Nuh-unh.

05:36.988 --> 05:39.339
Eat your pizza and go back
to your dorm. We got this.

05:44.213 --> 05:46.520
All right. I drove around
the block. No silver sedans.

05:46.520 --> 05:48.478
Thanks for coming, Will.
This is Charles.

05:48.478 --> 05:50.262
- He's Jeremy's father.
- Hey.

05:53.744 --> 05:55.355
Great to meet you.

05:55.355 --> 05:57.182
Um, let's check out your place.
Is it...?

05:57.182 --> 05:58.488
Uh, no, uh, that's me.

05:58.488 --> 06:00.577
I rent the room
over the garage.

06:00.577 --> 06:03.363
Oh, an ADU?
How many square feet?

06:03.363 --> 06:05.408
Okay, can we geek out about
home improvements later?

06:05.408 --> 06:07.236
I'm missing <i>The Bachelorette</i>
for this.

06:07.236 --> 06:08.368
Wow.

06:11.240 --> 06:12.415
Bathroom's clear.

06:12.415 --> 06:14.286
Anything out of place?

06:14.286 --> 06:16.724
No, it looks okay.

06:16.724 --> 06:19.117
You typically leave the blinds
closed all day?

06:19.117 --> 06:22.251
No, I-I leave it open
so the plants can get light.

06:22.251 --> 06:25.689
You seem like a tidy person.
There's dirt on the floor.

06:25.689 --> 06:28.126
No, that's-- that's not right.
I-I just vacuumed this morning.

06:28.126 --> 06:30.259
Well, somebody
was in here.

06:30.259 --> 06:32.522
And they were standing
right here.

06:32.522 --> 06:34.524
What do you see
from there?

06:34.524 --> 06:36.178
Just the house below.

06:37.353 --> 06:38.572
Who lives there?

06:38.572 --> 06:40.269
Sally and Kevin,
my landlords.

06:41.575 --> 06:43.490
Maybe whoever was here
wasn't here for you after all.

06:45.579 --> 06:47.102
Let's go check on
Sally and Kevin.

06:53.717 --> 06:54.892
- Oh, my God.
- Charles!

06:54.892 --> 06:56.154
Charles!

06:56.154 --> 06:57.808
Oh, my God.

07:04.554 --> 07:06.121
She had your card on her.

07:07.383 --> 07:09.994
Yep, she's testifying for us
against a sex trafficker--

07:09.994 --> 07:11.561
Matty Ellwood.
What happened?

07:11.561 --> 07:13.607
Picked her up trying
to make a heroin buy.

07:13.607 --> 07:15.565
But she told me not to call you
because you

07:15.565 --> 07:17.001
"ruin lives
for sick thrills."

07:17.001 --> 07:18.742
"Sick" thrills?

07:18.742 --> 07:21.266
Hurtful, I know.

07:21.266 --> 07:22.485
Can I release her
in your custody?

07:22.485 --> 07:25.793
Thanks, Wirth.

07:25.793 --> 07:27.577
Katie.

07:27.577 --> 07:29.449
Do you know how many days
it's been?

07:29.449 --> 07:31.451
You left me to rot.

07:31.451 --> 07:34.018
That is a nice safehouse.
All the good junk food.

07:34.018 --> 07:36.194
Everything you could want--
except heroin, I guess.

07:36.194 --> 07:37.848
Well, the heroin's
important, actually.

07:37.848 --> 07:39.459
That's why Matty
gave it to me.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.678
Yeah, you know what? I know
that it's important, actually.

07:41.678 --> 07:43.506
I do. I get it.
Are you making it to meetings?

07:43.506 --> 07:45.813
- Every day.
- Yeah?

07:45.813 --> 07:47.858
Leaves me with the other 23
hours to sit around and think.

07:47.858 --> 07:49.991
Hey. Think about this.
Think about this.

07:49.991 --> 07:52.472
What you're doing matters.
You are putting Matty in jail.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.474
Your testimony,
you and me,

07:54.474 --> 07:57.041
we are taking a sex trafficker
off the streets.

07:57.041 --> 07:58.390
Think about that.

08:01.002 --> 08:02.656
There's this girl, Jade.

08:02.656 --> 08:06.311
And before I knew
how bad my situation was,

08:06.311 --> 08:09.010
I convinced Jade that she should
hang out with Matty, too.

08:10.533 --> 08:13.231
And I can't stop thinking
about how she's still out there.

08:13.231 --> 08:14.624
And I don't know

08:14.624 --> 08:16.321
- how I'm supposed to go on.
- I know.

08:16.321 --> 08:18.149
I don't know how I'm
supposed to do-- do this.

08:18.149 --> 08:20.325
I know. I get it.
It's hard.

08:20.325 --> 08:22.414
She's really young.

08:23.285 --> 08:24.721
How young?

08:24.721 --> 08:26.375
She said she was 15.

08:27.942 --> 08:30.335
I-I need--
I need Jade to be safe.

08:30.335 --> 08:31.902
That's the only way
I can do this,

08:31.902 --> 08:34.209
is if you promise me
that Jade will be safe.

08:35.297 --> 08:36.907
I will go get her.

08:38.126 --> 08:40.563
I promise. Okay?

08:42.652 --> 08:45.089
Charles, why would
somebody be after you?

08:45.089 --> 08:46.351
There has to be a reason.

08:46.351 --> 08:47.570
They were following me.

08:47.570 --> 08:49.050
Sally and Kevin are dead
because of me.

08:50.704 --> 08:53.881
Okay. Okay. Come here.

08:55.447 --> 08:57.188
You're okay.

08:59.930 --> 09:02.890
Big, big mess here.

09:02.890 --> 09:04.282
The perp had been
following Charles,

09:04.282 --> 09:05.849
who was living
in their garage.

09:05.849 --> 09:07.677
Something caused the perp
to switch his focus

09:07.677 --> 09:09.853
- to the two of them.
- Want me to tell you what I see,

09:09.853 --> 09:12.552
or would you like
to do the thing you do?

09:14.902 --> 09:18.470
Just the single shot
for the two of them?

09:18.470 --> 09:21.691
And, uh... no signs
of sexual assault, right?

09:21.691 --> 09:23.040
Nope.

09:23.040 --> 09:25.086
All right.

09:29.960 --> 09:33.268
They were packing their bags
to get out of town.

09:33.268 --> 09:34.574
They knew
they were in trouble.

09:34.574 --> 09:35.792
We're not getting her
involved in this!

09:37.707 --> 09:39.100
Hide.

09:42.582 --> 09:43.713
Come on.

09:43.713 --> 09:45.715
- Perp came in.
- Please.

09:45.715 --> 09:46.977
Shot him right away.

09:49.545 --> 09:50.894
Then he tied her up.

09:52.243 --> 09:53.723
Judging by the state
of the house,

09:53.723 --> 09:56.465
he was looking
for something.

09:56.465 --> 09:59.163
He hurt her to try
to get her to talk.

09:59.163 --> 10:01.122
You think she gave up what
the perp was looking for?

10:04.734 --> 10:06.997
Nah.

10:06.997 --> 10:09.739
If she had, he would've finished
her off with a gunshot.

10:09.739 --> 10:12.524
She bled out.

10:12.524 --> 10:15.919
What was she protecting
that was worth dying for?

10:15.919 --> 10:18.966
Maybe she knew she was
gonna die no matter what.

10:18.966 --> 10:21.577
Still took a lot of guts
to keep quiet.

10:23.405 --> 10:24.928
That's strange.

10:24.928 --> 10:26.321
Her hand's pretty clean
aside from the blood

10:26.321 --> 10:27.496
on her fingertip.

10:31.674 --> 10:33.545
Maybe she was trying
to tell us something.

10:38.942 --> 10:41.815
Sally drew this star
with her own blood.

10:43.033 --> 10:44.556
What do you think
it means?

10:44.556 --> 10:47.168
She wanted us to find it.
That's all I know.

10:48.996 --> 10:50.998
So Charles just breezes
back into your life

10:50.998 --> 10:52.782
and drops a dead body
at your feet, huh?

10:52.782 --> 10:54.654
Two, actually.

10:54.654 --> 10:56.220
It's always something
with this guy.

10:56.220 --> 10:58.658
Amanda. It's been 19 years.
Can you give it a rest?

10:59.746 --> 11:02.531
However we got here,
we have a double homicide.

11:02.531 --> 11:04.968
The intruder was after Charles'
landlord, Sally Wallace.

11:04.968 --> 11:08.319
She's a software engineer
at the tech company Selantus.

11:08.319 --> 11:09.669
Selantus?
You're kidding.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.671
Why does that sound
so familiar?

11:11.671 --> 11:13.498
They design and manage all
of our electronic systems.

11:13.498 --> 11:16.719
Case files, suspect database.
They even run our payroll.

11:16.719 --> 11:19.417
We should, uh, poke around
Selantus, ask some questions.

11:19.417 --> 11:21.550
Maybe "star" was a project
Sally was working on.

11:21.550 --> 11:22.899
Yeah,
but tread carefully.

11:22.899 --> 11:24.074
They're important partners
for us.

11:24.074 --> 11:25.119
Always.

11:26.424 --> 11:27.687
So, where's
Charles staying?

11:27.687 --> 11:29.253
With me.

11:29.253 --> 11:32.256
In Jeremy's old room.
Until I figure all this out.

11:32.256 --> 11:34.519
- Well, that's convenient.
- What does that mean?

11:34.519 --> 11:36.173
It means you just got
one kid out of the house.

11:36.173 --> 11:37.697
Don't let him
put another baby in you.

11:37.697 --> 11:38.741
Amanda, why don't you
mind your business?!

11:38.741 --> 11:40.395
Come on.
We're leaving.

11:42.266 --> 11:44.834
Ohh!
What is wrong with her?!

11:44.834 --> 11:46.749
I mean, where do you
want to start?

11:46.749 --> 11:49.273
I was 15 years old.
We both were.

11:49.273 --> 11:50.622
And if I hadn't
made that mistake,

11:50.622 --> 11:52.102
then I wouldn't
have had Jeremy.

11:52.102 --> 11:54.539
Do you think Jeremy
is a mistake?!

11:54.539 --> 11:57.194
- I support all your choices.
- Thank you.

11:57.194 --> 11:58.848
You wanna know who doesn't
support my choices?

11:58.848 --> 12:01.024
My mother.
And "Auntie Mandy."

12:01.024 --> 12:02.547
Mandy?

12:02.547 --> 12:04.767
That two-headed
terrifying cop monster.

12:04.767 --> 12:06.116
That's why
I didn't tell them

12:06.116 --> 12:08.728
until I was
seven months pregnant.

12:11.600 --> 12:12.644
Is there something
I should be saying right now,

12:12.644 --> 12:14.037
or do you need me
to just listen?

12:14.037 --> 12:16.561
Where do they get off
criticizing Charles?

12:16.561 --> 12:18.868
She and my mom were the ones
who told him to leave me alone,

12:18.868 --> 12:20.000
and that is why
he enlisted.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.653
That's why he went
to Afghanistan...

12:21.653 --> 12:23.743
...and that is why he has PTSD.

12:26.789 --> 12:29.531
Well, uh, seemed like
a great guy to me.

12:31.446 --> 12:33.274
Should we go solve this thing
so he can get on with his life?

12:33.274 --> 12:35.667
Yes. Great idea.
Thank you.

12:43.240 --> 12:45.416
This is Selantus?

12:45.416 --> 12:48.289
They trying to keep people out
or in?

12:55.078 --> 12:57.602
Special Agents Trent
and Mitchell with the GBI.

12:57.602 --> 12:59.822
We have a warrant to search
the workspace of Sally Wallace.

12:59.822 --> 13:03.130
Hi. Uh, Vince Arrigotti,
Head of Software.

13:03.130 --> 13:04.784
Did I hear you say
you're GBI?

13:04.784 --> 13:06.133
That's right.

13:06.133 --> 13:07.787
Is everything okay
with Sally?

13:07.787 --> 13:09.614
She didn't show up
for work this morning.

13:09.614 --> 13:12.748
Sally was killed last night
in a home invasion.

13:14.010 --> 13:14.968
What?

13:16.665 --> 13:18.145
Sally was
one of the best.

13:18.145 --> 13:20.147
Terrific coder.
Friendly face.

13:24.934 --> 13:27.284
Sorry.
I'm-- I'm just--

13:27.284 --> 13:29.330
I'm just still trying
to process all this.

13:29.330 --> 13:31.288
It's shocking.
I know.

13:31.288 --> 13:33.551
Well, she kept things orderly.

13:33.551 --> 13:35.466
Yeah, our-- our cleaning crew
comes through every weeknight.

13:35.466 --> 13:36.946
They're very thorough.

13:36.946 --> 13:39.644
She, uh, didn't carry
any notebooks?

13:39.644 --> 13:41.646
No binders or folders?

13:41.646 --> 13:44.301
No. Our entire office went
paperless a few years ago.

13:44.301 --> 13:46.303
That's a whole lot of pens
for someone with no paper.

13:46.303 --> 13:48.349
Then we'll need a copy
of her e-mail box

13:48.349 --> 13:50.655
and any internal messaging
systems you may have.

13:50.655 --> 13:52.962
Anything you need,
we'll get it for you.

13:52.962 --> 13:55.138
I'm Reese Fox,
Selantus CEO.

13:55.138 --> 13:57.575
Reese, this is Will Trent
and Faith Mitchell.

13:57.575 --> 13:59.403
They're from the GBI.

13:59.403 --> 14:01.884
If there are any questions
we can answer about Sally

14:01.884 --> 14:04.887
or whatever you're looking for,
please fire away.

14:04.887 --> 14:07.411
No, we're good for now. Thanks.

14:07.411 --> 14:10.023
They were trying to
figure out what we knew.

14:10.023 --> 14:11.676
I don't like this place
at all.

14:11.676 --> 14:13.896
Yeah, me neither.
But you got to hand it to 'em.

14:13.896 --> 14:16.507
That software is so much nicer
than APD's.

14:16.507 --> 14:18.161
It's like if
a Swedish design firm

14:18.161 --> 14:19.989
decided to make life easier
for cops.

14:19.989 --> 14:21.034
- Can I get two bananas?
- Yeah.

14:21.034 --> 14:22.339
- You have matcha?
- Mnh-mnh.

14:22.339 --> 14:23.863
Just the bananas.

14:23.863 --> 14:26.256
That guy Vince knew our full
names. We never told him.

14:26.256 --> 14:27.997
You think Amanda
gave them the heads-up?

14:27.997 --> 14:29.694
Without running it
by us first?

14:29.694 --> 14:31.914
It would've given them time
to clean up Sally's desk,

14:31.914 --> 14:33.785
but what would they
be hiding?

14:33.785 --> 14:36.527
You do not need to
babysit my diabetes.

14:36.527 --> 14:38.355
I had breakfast this morning
and everything.

14:38.355 --> 14:39.835
You want the free banana
or not?

14:41.097 --> 14:42.925
Huh.

14:42.925 --> 14:44.231
That's disappointing.

14:48.452 --> 14:49.627
Hey, Will?

14:49.627 --> 14:51.194
What is it?

14:51.194 --> 14:52.717
Tech conference
last weekend.

14:52.717 --> 14:54.545
Selantus was a sponsor.

14:54.545 --> 14:57.287
Will, it was held
at the Cavinridge Hotel.

14:57.287 --> 14:58.767
That's where
Charles works.

15:01.596 --> 15:04.425
Yeah, uh, Charles' key card
was used during the conference.

15:04.425 --> 15:06.731
I already talked to the GBI
about this.

15:06.731 --> 15:08.385
No, you didn't.
We're the GBI.

15:08.385 --> 15:10.387
Uh, yes, I did.

15:10.387 --> 15:12.433
Someone called wanting to know
what staff key card was used

15:12.433 --> 15:14.391
to open the room
during the conference.

15:14.391 --> 15:16.263
I gave them Charles' name.

15:16.263 --> 15:18.091
- That wasn't the GBI.
- Yes, it was.

15:18.091 --> 15:20.745
And I remember because
I was saying, "FBI?"

15:20.745 --> 15:22.269
And he said, "No. GBI."

15:22.269 --> 15:23.661
Well, you were lied to.

15:24.793 --> 15:27.230
Okay, Charles was
out of town last weekend,

15:27.230 --> 15:28.579
so he couldn't have used
his key card.

15:28.579 --> 15:29.580
Do you have video?

15:29.580 --> 15:31.626
Uh, yeah.

15:31.626 --> 15:33.671
Someone's
impersonating us now.

15:33.671 --> 15:35.238
Yeah, I'm flattered.

15:36.631 --> 15:38.676
Here we are.

15:38.676 --> 15:40.678
That's Sally.

15:40.678 --> 15:42.985
She must have stolen Charles'
card while he was out of town.

15:42.985 --> 15:44.856
Whose room is that?

15:44.856 --> 15:46.467
Well, it was part
of a block of rooms

15:46.467 --> 15:49.861
for the conference
booked by...

15:49.861 --> 15:51.298
Selantus Security.

15:53.648 --> 15:56.607
Well, whatever Sally took,
that's what they're looking for.

15:56.607 --> 15:57.826
Mm-hmm.

16:06.226 --> 16:08.576
<i>♪ Yeah, yeah, baby, baby♪</i>

16:08.576 --> 16:11.840
See, I used to work the griddle.
Great skill to have.

16:11.840 --> 16:13.494
And soothing, too,
when the world goes to hell.

16:13.494 --> 16:15.452
Yeah, I can make a good
frozen burrito, so...

16:15.452 --> 16:17.193
Oh, okay.

16:17.193 --> 16:19.065
Well, a kid your age should
know how to make five meals.

16:19.065 --> 16:20.805
- I can teach you.
- Yeah!

16:20.805 --> 16:22.285
- Yeah?
- That'd be dope.

16:22.285 --> 16:24.418
- All right, man.
- Hey, there.

16:25.636 --> 16:27.856
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

16:27.856 --> 16:31.903
Uh, I hope you don't mind,
uh, breakfast for dinner.

16:31.903 --> 16:33.209
I do not mind.

16:34.080 --> 16:35.472
The kitchen looks good.

16:35.472 --> 16:37.866
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
I-I-I cleaned.

16:37.866 --> 16:40.434
So, any leads?

16:40.434 --> 16:42.262
<i>♪ Trust me you haven't lived♪</i>

16:42.262 --> 16:44.829

16:47.658 --> 16:48.790

16:48.790 --> 16:50.487

16:50.487 --> 16:52.402
All right.

16:52.402 --> 16:54.839
<i>♪ Until you love somebody♪</i>

16:54.839 --> 16:57.059

16:58.452 --> 16:59.714
Oh, uh...

16:59.714 --> 17:01.803
nice, um, space.

17:01.803 --> 17:03.283
You should get a plant.

17:03.283 --> 17:05.633
Maybe some art.
A few more square feet.

17:05.633 --> 17:08.027
Well, I have Tim's
gross microwave he left behind.

17:08.027 --> 17:10.594
Man liked to reheat
a lot of soup, apparently.

17:10.594 --> 17:12.596
So, did you, uh,
ask Charles about the star?

17:12.596 --> 17:14.685
Yeah. He can't think of
anything it can mean.

17:14.685 --> 17:17.558
But get this. You know how
he was out of town last weekend?

17:17.558 --> 17:19.429
It was because Kevin
gave him tickets

17:19.429 --> 17:21.388
to a music festival
for his birthday.

17:21.388 --> 17:22.606
Kevin arranged for
Charles to be gone

17:22.606 --> 17:24.608
so that he and Sally
could use the hotel key.

17:24.608 --> 17:26.523
Do we think Kevin
put her up to it?

17:26.523 --> 17:28.743
The analyst pool is putting
together a Kevin profile,

17:28.743 --> 17:31.398
but Charles says he's just a guy
who works at a coffee shop.

17:31.398 --> 17:32.964
Sally had the career.
Kevin just liked

17:32.964 --> 17:34.792
- to hang out and read.
- Hmm.

17:34.792 --> 17:36.577
Good morning, Special Agents!

17:36.577 --> 17:38.709
Sorry.

17:38.709 --> 17:41.582
Uh, hi.
I am Rocky Angelina.

17:41.582 --> 17:44.063
I'm with digital forensics.
I've been assigned to your case.

17:44.063 --> 17:45.803
I was able to extract

17:45.803 --> 17:47.414
a digital backup
of your victim's cellphone.

17:47.414 --> 17:49.416
Let me show you.

17:49.416 --> 17:51.418
Okay.

17:51.418 --> 17:53.811
So, here,
you have texts, contacts,

17:53.811 --> 17:55.030
browsing history--
you name it.

17:55.030 --> 17:56.423
Can you search
the word "star"?

17:56.423 --> 17:57.554
You bet.

17:59.556 --> 18:02.255
Okay. Over 10,000 hits.

18:02.255 --> 18:05.649
How about the, um,
star symbol thing?

18:05.649 --> 18:07.303
I think he means
the emoji.

18:07.303 --> 18:08.522
- Yeah.
- Right.

18:09.914 --> 18:12.917
Ooh. Good instinct.
Look at this.

18:12.917 --> 18:14.180
One of Sally's contacts

18:14.180 --> 18:15.877
is just the star emoji
and a phone number.

18:15.877 --> 18:17.052
Let's call it.

18:24.451 --> 18:28.237
Hello? This is Special Agent
Will Trent with the GBI.

18:28.237 --> 18:29.847
<i>Who's this?</i>

18:31.110 --> 18:32.981
Whoa!

18:32.981 --> 18:34.504
Who was that?

18:34.504 --> 18:36.332
Who indeed, Rocky?

18:38.378 --> 18:39.553
You're not in Vice
anymore, Ang.

18:39.553 --> 18:41.163
Why don't you just
let them handle it?

18:41.163 --> 18:43.731
Vice is six weeks backlogged,
and this is time-sensitive.

18:43.731 --> 18:45.515
We could lose this case
against this dude

18:45.515 --> 18:47.169
that is trafficking
both of these girls.

18:47.169 --> 18:49.345
"Matty"?
That's a red flag right there.

18:49.345 --> 18:50.868
Even I knew
when to give up "Mikey."

18:50.868 --> 18:52.479
You could still
pull off "Mikey."

18:52.479 --> 18:54.133
I don't know if you mean that
in a good way.

18:54.133 --> 18:57.484
Listen. I got a tip. I know
where she's being pimped out of.

18:57.484 --> 18:59.268
Come on. Let's just go
do this ourselves.

18:59.268 --> 19:02.315
You got a warrant? What,
is she on a wire or something?

19:02.315 --> 19:04.186
Nope.

19:04.186 --> 19:06.623
So... what? We just come up with
an excuse to knock on the door?

19:06.623 --> 19:08.190
Yup.

19:08.190 --> 19:09.409
And whatever happens
happens?

19:09.409 --> 19:10.888
Yup.

19:10.888 --> 19:12.194
Okay. I'm in.

19:16.590 --> 19:18.418
Check this out.
I taught Betty a new trick.

19:18.418 --> 19:20.898
It's called The Moment.

19:20.898 --> 19:22.900
Hey, Betty,
are you the moment?

19:25.425 --> 19:27.644
Yes!
She is the moment!

19:27.644 --> 19:30.560
Wow, Betty.
Stunning as always.

19:30.560 --> 19:33.955
Nico, did you take $20
from my wallet?

19:33.955 --> 19:35.652
What? No.

19:35.652 --> 19:38.916
Two days ago,
I had $74 in my wallet.

19:38.916 --> 19:40.701
Three 20s, one 10,
and four singles,

19:40.701 --> 19:42.311
all facing
the same direction.

19:42.311 --> 19:46.315
It's compulsive, I know.
But you can't steal from me.

19:46.315 --> 19:48.012
I know where everything
in this house is.

19:48.012 --> 19:50.493
Now, I'm gonna
ask you again.

19:50.493 --> 19:52.321
Did you take $20
out of my wallet?

19:55.890 --> 19:58.719
Whatever.
You can afford it.

19:58.719 --> 20:02.201
Nico, if you need money,
just ask.

20:03.898 --> 20:05.073
What's going on?

20:07.293 --> 20:09.120
I don't need any favors.

20:09.120 --> 20:12.123
I didn't ask
for this job.

20:12.123 --> 20:14.256
Let's just make
this easy.

20:14.256 --> 20:16.258
I quit.

20:32.231 --> 20:34.450
Yeah. Rough.

20:39.586 --> 20:41.718
Okay. Don't freak out.

20:41.718 --> 20:43.329
What is it?

20:43.329 --> 20:45.722
I took him to Piedmont Park
just to, like, walk around,

20:45.722 --> 20:47.115
you know, touch grass.

20:47.115 --> 20:48.943
- I-It was good, but--
- What?

21:00.084 --> 21:01.434
Charles?

21:01.434 --> 21:02.913
Are you okay?

21:05.089 --> 21:06.613
Someone was here.

21:06.613 --> 21:08.571
What makes you say that?

21:08.571 --> 21:10.356
It's off. The house.
It-- It--

21:10.356 --> 21:13.141
I can't explain it.
It just smells different.

21:14.142 --> 21:15.274
Did you
notice anything?

21:15.274 --> 21:17.798
It smells normal to me.

21:17.798 --> 21:20.409
All right. All right.

21:20.409 --> 21:22.629
Let's clear the house,
and if we need to,

21:22.629 --> 21:24.195
I will have APD come
and send a patrol car

21:24.195 --> 21:27.024
to watch the front door.

21:27.024 --> 21:27.851
Okay?

21:27.851 --> 21:29.636
Mm-hmm.

21:50.309 --> 21:51.788
Faith, I'm sorry.

21:51.788 --> 21:53.181
I just don't know what's real
and what's not anymore.

21:53.181 --> 21:55.488
You're good.

22:11.242 --> 22:12.635
<i>Yeah?</i>

22:12.635 --> 22:16.465
We're okay, but somebody
broke into my house.

22:16.465 --> 22:17.901
Someone's following me.

22:17.901 --> 22:19.338
<i>What?
Where are you?</i>

22:19.338 --> 22:20.556
I'll call you back.

22:30.218 --> 22:31.393
Hey!

22:34.309 --> 22:36.398
Why are you
following me?!

22:36.398 --> 22:39.140
Jess Noonan. I'm a reporter
for the <i>Atlanta Star Standard.</i>

22:39.140 --> 22:40.707
You're star.

22:40.707 --> 22:42.578
Can we go somewhere
to talk?

22:53.415 --> 22:56.679
You have to promise me that
you tell no one about this.

22:56.679 --> 22:58.725
Not your therapist,
not your mom,

22:58.725 --> 23:02.511
and, for sure, no case notes--
not until this is over.

23:02.511 --> 23:04.208
Unless you want another
dead body to clean up.

23:04.208 --> 23:06.994
Okay.
Talk to us about Sally.

23:06.994 --> 23:08.125
She was
a whistleblower?

23:09.475 --> 23:11.433
Sally and I went
to college together.

23:11.433 --> 23:12.869
I hadn't seen her
in a while,

23:12.869 --> 23:15.829
but she came to me
a few weeks ago with a tip.

23:17.352 --> 23:19.485
There is a back door
in the software

23:19.485 --> 23:21.530
that Selantus designed
for the GBI.

23:21.530 --> 23:23.489
Record searches,
logged evidence,

23:23.489 --> 23:25.665
house calls, case notes.

23:25.665 --> 23:28.102
They're spying on you.

23:28.102 --> 23:30.147
That would explain why they knew
we were coming to their office.

23:30.147 --> 23:31.714
Who's using this?

23:31.714 --> 23:33.629
Look up the investors
for Selantus.

23:33.629 --> 23:37.198
It's every inner-circle old boy
in Atlanta.

23:37.198 --> 23:38.939
So you're saying that people
are paying to find out

23:38.939 --> 23:40.723
what the GBI knows
and when?

23:40.723 --> 23:42.725
It's incredibly valuable information.

23:42.725 --> 23:43.900
Does anyone know
about you?

23:43.900 --> 23:46.163
I haven't told anyone
at the paper.

23:46.163 --> 23:48.078
Reese Fox,
CEO of Selantus?

23:48.078 --> 23:51.125
She donates to my editor's
cancer charity. They brunch.

23:51.125 --> 23:54.041
So, what were you gonna do
with Sally's information?

23:54.041 --> 23:57.348
I told her she had to get me
the actual code on a hard drive,

23:57.348 --> 24:00.743
something that no one could
deny, then I would publish.

24:00.743 --> 24:03.224
The next time
that I heard from her

24:03.224 --> 24:05.356
was when she mailed me
this key with a note

24:05.356 --> 24:08.142
that said she'd call me
to tell me what it opens.

24:08.142 --> 24:10.013
But someone
got to her first.

24:10.013 --> 24:12.451
We knew Selantus would
want the hard drive back.

24:15.192 --> 24:18.065
But I never thought that
they would murder her for it.

24:18.065 --> 24:19.458
If what you're saying
is true

24:19.458 --> 24:21.677
and Selantus is selling
GBI intelligence,

24:21.677 --> 24:24.550
then they would need
to protect their clients.

24:24.550 --> 24:25.725
And the only way we can prove
that you're right

24:25.725 --> 24:27.683
is with that hard drive,
but we don't know

24:27.683 --> 24:30.207
where Sally hid it
or what that key goes to.

24:30.207 --> 24:32.645
- You have to find out.
- Here's what we're gonna do.

24:32.645 --> 24:35.474
We're gonna take you to the GBI,
where we can keep you safe.

24:35.474 --> 24:38.041
You think that
the GBI is safe?

24:38.041 --> 24:39.739
Belly of the beast.

24:39.739 --> 24:41.784
I can take care of myself.

24:41.784 --> 24:43.830
Don't use your computer
or your phone,

24:43.830 --> 24:45.745
anything with Selantus software installed.

24:45.745 --> 24:48.312
If you want to stay alive...

24:48.312 --> 24:49.662
trust no one.

24:55.102 --> 24:56.669
<i>♪ Give me the night♪</i>

24:59.062 --> 25:01.021
<i>♪ Give me the night♪</i>

25:06.940 --> 25:08.637
What the hell happened?

25:08.637 --> 25:10.552
Give me your phone.

25:12.162 --> 25:14.208
Why'd you just put my phone
in a dirty microwave?

25:14.208 --> 25:17.124
- This is a clean room.
- Should I go get my tinfoil hat?

25:17.124 --> 25:18.691
Selantus is wiretapping
the GBI

25:18.691 --> 25:20.344
with the software
they made for us.

25:20.344 --> 25:23.043
D-Do you have proof?

25:23.043 --> 25:25.045
We have the dead body of
the reporter who was working

25:25.045 --> 25:26.612
with Sally, the whistleblower,
who is also dead.

25:26.612 --> 25:28.396
We also have
a threatening note

25:28.396 --> 25:29.789
that someone left
in my house last night.

25:29.789 --> 25:31.138
Selantus knew we were
coming to their office.

25:31.138 --> 25:32.574
They've been one step ahead.

25:32.574 --> 25:34.968
Someone's even impersonating
the GBI on the phone.

25:36.447 --> 25:38.580
- Guys--
- Rocky, come in. Close the door.

25:38.580 --> 25:40.887
Sorry to be rude. I-I've
been calling over and over.

25:40.887 --> 25:43.150
- This is a clean room.
- Cool.

25:43.150 --> 25:45.108
I want to let you know
someone is doing maintenance

25:45.108 --> 25:46.240
on the computer servers,

25:46.240 --> 25:47.589
- and it's fishy.
- Fishy how?

25:47.589 --> 25:49.330
Well, I talked to everyone
who's on duty with IT,

25:49.330 --> 25:51.724
and no one knows who's doing it.
That's weird.

25:51.724 --> 25:53.029
Selantus is
scrubbing the code.

25:53.029 --> 25:54.901
They're covering their tracks.
Thanks, Rocky.

25:54.901 --> 25:56.946
Amanda, you got to
shut it down.

25:56.946 --> 25:59.427
Okay, listen. Let me talk
to Director Armstrong.

25:59.427 --> 26:00.907
I've got to give him
a heads-up.

26:00.907 --> 26:03.083
No. Absolutely not.
He might be a part of this.

26:03.083 --> 26:04.693
- Excuse me?
- You can't trust him, okay?

26:04.693 --> 26:06.608
The guys on that level, they're
all playing the same game.

26:06.608 --> 26:08.044
What if I'm on that level
someday, Will?

26:08.044 --> 26:09.872
I-Is this what you're
gonna think of me?

26:09.872 --> 26:12.440
Is that what this is about?
Protecting your final promotion?

26:12.440 --> 26:14.921
Whoa, guys! Same team. We got to
figure out a call here.

26:15.922 --> 26:18.011
Hi. Um, ma'am...

26:18.011 --> 26:19.926
Director Armstrong
is in your office.

26:21.884 --> 26:24.583
I'm gonna go talk
to my boss.

26:24.583 --> 26:26.541
Caroline, will you please get
my phone out of the microwave?

26:27.977 --> 26:30.327
Uh, Special Agent Mitchell,
Charles is on his way up.

26:30.327 --> 26:33.113
And, um, Special Agent Trent,
I had someone pick up

26:33.113 --> 26:34.549
a fresh suit for you,
as you requested.

26:34.549 --> 26:36.943
Thank you, Caroline.

26:36.943 --> 26:38.988
You had Caroline send
someone to your house?

26:38.988 --> 26:40.990
You have a really unhealthy
attachment to your suits.

26:40.990 --> 26:42.905
- You know that?
- Yes. I do.

26:42.905 --> 26:45.081
Hm.

26:45.081 --> 26:47.736
I pulled the case file.

26:47.736 --> 26:49.564
Your people think
last night's shooting

26:49.564 --> 26:51.653
is linked to the Selantus
home invasion?

26:51.653 --> 26:53.699
My people think Selantus
is doing the shooting.

26:53.699 --> 26:55.265
Amanda, that's insane.

26:55.265 --> 26:56.919
There has to be something else
going on here.

26:56.919 --> 26:59.269
- Who's telling you this?
- I've got Trent on it.

26:59.269 --> 27:01.620
And you support
what he's saying?

27:01.620 --> 27:05.058
Sir, do you remember how
I investigated Lorne Renfield

27:05.058 --> 27:06.799
for fraud
a few years ago?

27:06.799 --> 27:08.844
He's on the Board
of Selantus.

27:08.844 --> 27:11.107
Do you have a question
for me?

27:11.107 --> 27:12.500
His defense against
my investigation

27:12.500 --> 27:14.458
was the most impressive
I'd ever seen.

27:14.458 --> 27:15.938
It was as though
he knew my playbook

27:15.938 --> 27:17.984
the minute I put it out
on the server.

27:17.984 --> 27:20.987
Let it go.
You didn't have a case.

27:20.987 --> 27:22.902
Maybe he got
a little greedy,

27:22.902 --> 27:25.208
cut a corner
on his quarterly filings,

27:25.208 --> 27:27.036
but he didn't break
any laws.

27:27.036 --> 27:29.386
And now he knows
that you're watching him.

27:29.386 --> 27:31.693
Well, I'd say
we're watching each other.

27:31.693 --> 27:32.868
It's checks and balances.

27:32.868 --> 27:34.304
The system of
law enforcement

27:34.304 --> 27:37.307
works exactly
how it was designed to.

27:40.833 --> 27:43.357
Of course.
You're right.

27:43.357 --> 27:44.619
Good.

27:55.586 --> 27:58.328
- So?
- This is Sally's P.O. box key.

27:58.328 --> 28:00.679
I checked it a few times for her
when she went on vacation.

28:00.679 --> 28:02.681
That's where she hid the hard
drive. We need to get to it.

28:02.681 --> 28:04.117
Oh, I can send you
the box number.

28:04.117 --> 28:06.075
If they're wiping the computers,
that hard drive

28:06.075 --> 28:08.512
is the only remaining evidence
that a back door ever existed.

28:08.512 --> 28:10.471
What are you doing?!

28:10.471 --> 28:12.516
I just e-mailed you
the box number.

28:12.516 --> 28:14.475
Why did he have a cellphone?
This is a clean room.

28:14.475 --> 28:15.737
What's a clean room?

28:15.737 --> 28:17.304
You think Selantus
is reading our e-mails?

28:17.304 --> 28:18.784
Jess specifically said
not to use our cellphones.

28:18.784 --> 28:20.699
We should assume
they can see everything.

28:20.699 --> 28:22.526
We need to get to that
mailbox before they do.

28:22.526 --> 28:24.746
Hey! What's going on?
My computer stopped working!

28:24.746 --> 28:27.793
I believe you. Now go solve this
thing before we lose our jobs.

28:27.793 --> 28:29.229
Try rebooting your system.

28:38.542 --> 28:40.240
So, Katie says
the way this works

28:40.240 --> 28:42.459
is that Matty says he's gonna
introduce the girl

28:42.459 --> 28:44.548
to his "producer" friend,

28:44.548 --> 28:46.768
and then he leaves them alone,
and some amazing role

28:46.768 --> 28:48.465
rests on what she's
willing to do with him.

28:48.465 --> 28:49.292
Ah, that seems legit.

28:51.512 --> 28:53.253
You sure
you wanna do this?

28:53.253 --> 28:55.081
The girl doesn't talk, this
guy's gonna have us by the ass.

28:55.081 --> 28:56.778
I will get her to talk.
I will.

29:03.698 --> 29:05.047
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, APD.

29:05.047 --> 29:06.527
We were passing by
and heard a scream.

29:06.527 --> 29:09.182
What? No.
Wasn't from in here.

29:09.182 --> 29:10.444
Try next door.
They do waxing.

29:10.444 --> 29:11.662
You know what?

29:11.662 --> 29:13.055
We're gonna need
to take a look around.

29:13.055 --> 29:14.187
We'll be out of your hair
in two minutes.

29:14.187 --> 29:15.492
No! Get a warrant!

29:15.492 --> 29:17.364
Nah, we have probable cause.

29:17.364 --> 29:19.845
This is a Fourth Amendment
violation. There was no scream.

29:19.845 --> 29:22.238
You sure? You have a security
camera you can check?

29:22.238 --> 29:24.153
Dang it. Looks like
this is the only one.

29:24.153 --> 29:25.894
What do you use
this puppy for, huh?

29:25.894 --> 29:28.027
- Where's Jade?
- Hey, that's a private office!

29:28.027 --> 29:30.029
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

29:34.120 --> 29:36.818
Hey! Yo! Get off of her.
Get the hell off of her!

29:36.818 --> 29:38.341
Let's go.

29:38.341 --> 29:41.388
This is a casting session.
We're talking about a role.

29:41.388 --> 29:43.738
Jade.
Your name is Jade, right?

29:43.738 --> 29:45.827
I'm Angie Polaski. I'm APD.
I want to help you.

29:45.827 --> 29:47.960
Matty said
this is my big break.

29:49.439 --> 29:51.441
All right.
Arms up, please.

29:56.359 --> 29:58.318
Courtesy of Matty, right?

29:58.318 --> 30:00.276
Listen. I don't want
to take you in for this.

30:00.276 --> 30:01.408
I don't want to
take you in at all.

30:01.408 --> 30:03.453
I want you to leave, willingly.

30:06.892 --> 30:09.198
Everyone is gonna be
so pissed at me.

30:09.198 --> 30:10.765
Matty's going to jail.

30:10.765 --> 30:12.419
Your friend Katie's
gonna make sure of it.

30:12.419 --> 30:14.421
She just wanted you
to be safe first.

30:14.421 --> 30:16.466
Guess she's jealous.

30:16.466 --> 30:18.033
I will sue the department!
Who's your captain?

30:18.033 --> 30:21.254
Get your hand off that phone,
sit down, and shut up!

30:21.254 --> 30:23.125
Listen to me.

30:23.125 --> 30:25.432
Matty is lying.
He's not an agent.

30:25.432 --> 30:26.912
He's not legit.

30:26.912 --> 30:29.653
He sold Katie.

30:29.653 --> 30:33.309
He sold her to
a violent sex offender,

30:33.309 --> 30:35.442
and he's gonna do
the same thing to you next.

30:36.486 --> 30:38.924
Did he give you
a tattoo?

30:38.924 --> 30:40.316
He gives them
to all his girls.

30:42.057 --> 30:43.493
Let me see.

30:46.932 --> 30:48.716
I've seen a lot of these.

30:49.891 --> 30:52.111
Not on actors or models.

30:52.111 --> 30:56.115
The last one I saw was
on an O.D. at the morgue.

30:56.115 --> 31:01.250
Please.
Just tell me.

31:01.250 --> 31:04.427
Is Matty forcing you
to have sex with these men?

31:06.908 --> 31:07.953
I'm an actress.

31:11.217 --> 31:12.827
I'm gonna be famous.

31:12.827 --> 31:14.873
Not like this.

31:16.570 --> 31:17.963
Not like this.

31:19.225 --> 31:21.618
Just tell me, Jade.

31:21.618 --> 31:23.794
Is he forcing you?
Yes or no?

31:26.797 --> 31:28.582
Yeah? Okay.

31:28.582 --> 31:31.063
Okay. Thank you.

31:34.631 --> 31:37.025
Let's get you out of here.
Come on.

31:56.305 --> 31:58.046
Silver Lexus.

31:59.787 --> 32:01.876
Just help me.
Help me help you.

32:01.876 --> 32:03.051
I'm just trying
to get into this box.

32:03.051 --> 32:04.792
It's Vince.

32:04.792 --> 32:06.663
- Freeze! GBI!
- Oh, my God!

32:06.663 --> 32:07.969
- He's got a gun!
- Get down!

32:10.841 --> 32:12.800
Find the box.
Can you open this door?

32:12.800 --> 32:14.367
- Yeah, yeah.
- Got it.

32:16.021 --> 32:18.110
- Everybody get down!
- He has the hard drive.

32:21.983 --> 32:23.985
Move! Move!

32:30.818 --> 32:32.907
Vince,
you don't have to do this.

32:32.907 --> 32:34.865
Give us the hard drive,
and we can end this.

32:39.566 --> 32:41.263
- That didn't work.
- Yeah, no.

32:45.789 --> 32:47.356
Your computers
will be operational again

32:47.356 --> 32:49.663
once we know
the situation is secure.

32:49.663 --> 32:53.449
Amanda, you cannot unilaterally
shut down the GBI.

32:53.449 --> 32:55.669
- Sir--
- Frankly, I'm shocked

32:55.669 --> 32:57.627
that you'd jeopardize
your future.

32:57.627 --> 32:59.760
What does my future
have to do with this?

32:59.760 --> 33:02.067
You're not taking this
personally, are you?

33:02.067 --> 33:03.633
Just fix it.

33:08.334 --> 33:10.075
Come here!
Come here! Come here!

33:10.075 --> 33:11.772
No!

33:11.772 --> 33:13.643
Open it. Open the door!
Open the door!

33:18.953 --> 33:22.000
Stay down! Stay down!

33:22.000 --> 33:24.132
Vince, we know you were
spying on the GBI, all right?

33:24.132 --> 33:26.265
There's no hiding it.

33:27.353 --> 33:28.702
You don't know anything.

33:29.920 --> 33:31.661
What I do know is whatever
Selantus promised you

33:31.661 --> 33:33.315
is not worth dying for.

33:56.121 --> 33:58.775
You're under arrest.

33:59.776 --> 34:01.517
We were able to tie
Vince Arrigotti's gun

34:01.517 --> 34:03.258
to each of the crime scenes.

34:03.258 --> 34:04.738
He killed three people.

34:04.738 --> 34:07.088
And now he's in a jail cell
refusing to talk,

34:07.088 --> 34:09.003
hiding behind
the best lawyers in Georgia.

34:09.003 --> 34:11.353
So who told Vince to tamper
with the GBI code?

34:11.353 --> 34:13.964
<i>With due respect, Vince was
stealing secrets, yes,</i>

34:13.964 --> 34:15.966
<i>but they were our secrets.</i>

34:15.966 --> 34:18.621
<i>We looked into it, and we found
that Vince was stealing</i>

34:18.621 --> 34:20.493
<i>the code that made
our GBI operating system</i>

34:20.493 --> 34:23.191
<i>so fast and easy to use.</i>

34:23.191 --> 34:24.801
<i>We think he was selling it
to one of our competitors.</i>

34:24.801 --> 34:26.107
Are you kidding me?

34:26.107 --> 34:27.239
You think
he killed three people

34:27.239 --> 34:29.284
over the secret
of your pretty software?

34:29.284 --> 34:30.938
He was accessing
GBI case data

34:30.938 --> 34:32.766
and selling it
to the highest bidder.

34:32.766 --> 34:35.160
<i>Vince had a background
in Army Intelligence.</i>

34:35.160 --> 34:38.032
<i>Sometimes, that experience
can desensitize people.</i>

34:38.032 --> 34:40.295
- You are full of--
- Faith.

34:40.295 --> 34:43.168
Reese, we'll need to complete
our own forensic analysis

34:43.168 --> 34:45.953
of the GBI system
to confirm your findings.

34:45.953 --> 34:48.390
<i>- Of course, Director Armstrong.</i>
- You won't find anything.

34:48.390 --> 34:50.479
That's what the server
maintenance was about, right?

34:50.479 --> 34:51.785
They cleaned up
all their tracks.

34:51.785 --> 34:53.569
The only proof we had
of a back door

34:53.569 --> 34:56.094
evaporated when Vince destroyed
that hard drive.

34:56.094 --> 34:58.531
<i>That's offensive speculation,
Special Agent Trent.</i>

34:58.531 --> 35:02.230
- So shoot me.
- I think we're done here.

35:02.230 --> 35:04.102
This has been
a very unfortunate chapter

35:04.102 --> 35:05.842
for your company, Reese.

35:05.842 --> 35:07.931
There will have to be consequences.

35:07.931 --> 35:10.760
<i>We'll be tightening hiring
practices, background checks--</i>

35:10.760 --> 35:13.285
I think what the director means
is that the GBI

35:13.285 --> 35:14.895
is severing its relationship
with Selantus,

35:14.895 --> 35:17.245
effective immediately.

35:17.245 --> 35:20.683
<i>Is that what you meant,
Director Armstrong?</i>

35:22.294 --> 35:26.080
If Wagner's assessment is that
the trust has been broken--

35:26.080 --> 35:27.299
It is.

35:29.475 --> 35:32.042
Then, yes,
we will have to move on.

36:10.951 --> 36:12.474
Yeah, feels like

36:12.474 --> 36:14.128

- Yeah.

36:14.128 --> 36:18.088
Oh, and I talked Jeremy
out of the semester in Mexico.

36:18.088 --> 36:19.481
How did you do that?

36:19.481 --> 36:22.223
Oh, we-- we made plans.
You know?

36:22.223 --> 36:25.966

No. No.
Are you crazy?

36:44.680 --> 36:46.247
No. We were young.

36:46.247 --> 36:48.728
You were young.
I was young.

36:48.728 --> 36:52.558
And to be honest, I thought
your family was doing me a favor

36:52.558 --> 36:55.256
by telling me
to stay away.

36:55.256 --> 36:58.128
It was only when I joined up
that I...

36:58.128 --> 37:01.654
I started realizing
what I was missing.

37:01.654 --> 37:03.003
Yeah.

Hey. I thought you were

Made you look.

38:10.897 --> 38:13.639
- What happened?
- Nico got into a fight.

38:13.639 --> 38:15.249
Or more like they got
their ass handed to them.

38:15.249 --> 38:16.424
You should see
the other guy.

38:16.424 --> 38:19.384
It's like he just got out
of a day spa.

38:40.318 --> 38:44.017
You should know
that my record

38:44.017 --> 38:48.630
for waiting for a suspect
to talk is 23 hours.

38:48.630 --> 38:50.893
I got nothing but time.

38:50.893 --> 38:52.286
Not true.

38:52.286 --> 38:54.375
You've got one hour till Betty
poops on your rug.

38:55.985 --> 38:58.336
I'll buy another rug.

38:58.336 --> 39:00.903
Unless you stole more money
from me on your way out.

39:06.474 --> 39:09.042
What's going on, Nico?

39:09.042 --> 39:11.958
Does this have anything to do
with why you needed money?

39:11.958 --> 39:13.525
Who beat you up?

39:15.657 --> 39:18.268
Nico,
you can talk to me.

39:20.445 --> 39:22.403
Guy named Troy.

39:22.403 --> 39:24.057
I'm not kidding.

39:24.057 --> 39:26.059
That's his name.

39:26.059 --> 39:28.409
Troy.

39:28.409 --> 39:31.107
He lives downstairs.

39:31.107 --> 39:33.762
Simple extortion situation.

39:33.762 --> 39:36.417
20 bucks buys me 24 hours.

39:36.417 --> 39:39.638
What's Troy's last name?

39:39.638 --> 39:41.988
You know,
we're not close.

39:41.988 --> 39:43.642
What's his story?

39:43.642 --> 39:45.687
What else is he involved in?

39:45.687 --> 39:47.776
Can we move on from Troy?

39:47.776 --> 39:50.649
All you had to do
was tell me.

39:54.696 --> 39:57.656
Seems like you need to get out
of your living situation.

39:57.656 --> 40:00.049
That's a great idea.

40:00.049 --> 40:02.704
I think I'll rent
a penthouse in Buckhead.

40:02.704 --> 40:04.837
I have another idea.

40:09.624 --> 40:11.887
I'm sorry.
W-What's an ADU?

40:11.887 --> 40:13.846

40:15.151 --> 40:16.370
