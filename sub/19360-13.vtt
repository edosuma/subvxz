Shane Smith:
<i>This week on</i> Vice:

00:08.861 --> 00:11.928
<i>The final battle against ISIS
in Mosul.</i>

00:19.238 --> 00:21.772
Aris Roussinos: We're now
in the suburbs of Mosul,

00:21.807 --> 00:24.440
<i>which is, today,
a huge battlefield.</i>

00:24.476 --> 00:28.545
Smith: <i>And then, a lost
generation of Iraqi youth.</i>

00:28.580 --> 00:30.180
Isobel Yeung: Oh, my God.
What's that?

00:31.916 --> 00:34.584
Yeung: You don't mind your son
having these photos on his phone?

00:46.430 --> 00:47.796
Yeung:
Go, go, go!

00:50.701 --> 00:52.133
Refugee:
We are not animals!

01:03.413 --> 01:06.280
For over six months,
the fight against ISIS in Iraq

01:06.316 --> 01:08.249
has been reaching
its tipping point,

01:08.284 --> 01:12.220
<i>with a massive operation to regain
control of the city of Mosul.</i>

01:13.455 --> 01:15.922
Three years ago,
US trained coalition forces

01:15.957 --> 01:19.292
surrendered Iraq's second-largest
city to ISIS fighters,

01:19.328 --> 01:24.130
<i>and it's been the epicenter of the militant
group's operations in Iraq ever since.</i>

01:24.165 --> 01:27.367
To see what the battle against ISIS
looks like on the front lines,

01:27.402 --> 01:30.603
we sent Aris Roussinos
to embed with Iraqi forces

01:30.638 --> 01:35.006
as they began their assault on
ISIS's last stronghold in Iraq.

01:53.793 --> 01:55.760
Dawn's breaking,
and the long-awaited offensive

01:55.795 --> 01:57.662
to liberate Mosul
has just begun.

01:57.697 --> 01:59.464
The Peshmerga
are pushing through the berm

01:59.499 --> 02:01.466
<i>that separates their territory
from that of ISIS.</i>

02:01.501 --> 02:06.270
<i>The plan is to push ahead, liberate
a few villages on the road there.</i>

02:06.305 --> 02:09.339
Roussinos: <i>The offensive continues
a grueling two-year campaign</i>

02:09.375 --> 02:11.007
<i>by Iraqi and Kurdish troops</i>

02:11.042 --> 02:13.410
<i>that stretched hundreds
of miles northwest</i>

02:13.445 --> 02:16.580
<i>from the suburbs of Baghdad
to surround Mosul.</i>

02:17.816 --> 02:20.517
Fire!

02:24.622 --> 02:27.156
<i>As soon as
the offensive started,</i>

02:27.191 --> 02:30.225
<i>ISIS sent suicide bombers
to target Iraqi forces,</i>

02:30.261 --> 02:34.697
<i>and set oil reserves aflame in an attempt
to defend their hold on the city.</i>

02:41.638 --> 02:44.572
<i>We followed along with the Iraqi
Army's 9th Armored Division,</i>

02:44.608 --> 02:48.109
<i>as it assaulted ISIS-held
villages on their path.</i>

02:55.384 --> 02:58.585
The Iraqi Army have been held up at this
village for the past couple of days.

02:58.621 --> 03:01.121
They were complaining about the lack
of air support from the coalition,

03:01.156 --> 03:03.490
but since we've been here,
within in the past 10 minutes,

03:03.526 --> 03:06.327
two Iraqi Air Force helicopters,
helicopter gunships, have come in,

03:06.362 --> 03:08.595
and it's been hammering
the village with rockets.

03:08.631 --> 03:11.064
Roussinos: <i>But
ISIS counterattacked,</i>

03:11.099 --> 03:13.199
<i>exploding a mortar
just a few feet away from us</i>

03:13.234 --> 03:17.002
<i>and striking a BMP vehicle with a
missile, killing one of its crew.</i>

03:18.973 --> 03:22.809
We're up at the forwardmost front-line position
facing ISIS on the road towards Mosul.

03:22.844 --> 03:25.010
Man: Get down!

03:25.046 --> 03:26.646
Roussinos:
<i>The situation remained tense</i>

03:26.681 --> 03:28.715
<i>as the unit faced
constant gunfire</i>

03:28.750 --> 03:31.550
<i>and debated whether or not their
captive was an ISIS fighter.</i>

03:45.799 --> 03:47.565
Roussinos: <i>One of the
soldiers blamed the prisoner</i>

03:47.600 --> 03:48.899
<i>for the death of his friend,</i>

03:48.934 --> 03:52.135
<i>and he was taken away for
interrogation, away from the cameras.</i>

04:01.414 --> 04:04.054
Roussinos: <i>Despite the confident
tone and modern American weaponry,</i>

04:04.082 --> 04:08.084
<i>the Iraqi Army appeared poorly
organized for the battle ahead.</i>

04:21.298 --> 04:23.465
Roussinos: <i>As the Iraqi
Army pushed forward,</i>

04:23.501 --> 04:25.768
<i>they began stabilizing
the retaken area.</i>

04:25.803 --> 04:27.936
Roussinos: Since we've been
here, the Iraqi armored units

04:27.971 --> 04:30.238
have been able to take towns
and villages but not hold them.

04:30.274 --> 04:31.907
They need an infantry
to do that.

04:33.477 --> 04:36.678
<i>Tasked with securing
the retaken town of Qaraqosh,</i>

04:36.714 --> 04:38.846
<i>Colonel Omar Ali
allowed us to follow,</i>

04:38.882 --> 04:41.315
<i>as the army took stock
of the destruction.</i>

05:14.949 --> 05:16.882
This is the... the main
church, the cathedral.

05:18.453 --> 05:22.755
<i>Prior to the ISIS takeover, this
church was the largest in Iraq,</i>

05:22.790 --> 05:25.724
<i>summoning over 3,000 Christians
to mass every Sunday.</i>

05:25.760 --> 05:28.726
This is the altar of the cathedral.
You can see an icon there.

05:28.762 --> 05:31.696
They've obviously replaced it in the
past few days since they recaptured it.

06:01.794 --> 06:04.360
Roussinos: <i>But while some were
celebrating their return home,</i>

06:04.395 --> 06:06.596
<i>many more were still
fleeing the violence.</i>

06:08.399 --> 06:11.667
<i>Colonel Ali and his troops
move north to Karemlash,</i>

06:11.703 --> 06:15.838
<i>continuing their mission of securing
sites recaptured from ISIS.</i>

07:09.424 --> 07:11.990
Roussinos: <i>ISIS dug a vast web
of interconnecting tunnels</i>

07:12.026 --> 07:14.626
<i>to hide from air strikes
and surprise Iraqi forces,</i>

07:14.662 --> 07:18.163
<i>a strategy that allowed them to hold
the region for as long as they did.</i>

07:20.267 --> 07:23.435
You can see they've actually got a
professional boring machine hidden away here

07:23.470 --> 07:26.371
that ISIS have used to dig this
extensive network of tunnels

07:26.406 --> 07:28.806
that crisscrosses
the entire front line.

07:52.363 --> 07:53.863
Roussinos:
It all looks quite chaotic,

07:53.899 --> 07:55.498
but it's actually
deadly serious work.

07:55.533 --> 07:57.734
We don't know
if the excavator is mined.

07:57.769 --> 08:01.571
What's obvious when you see this is the
level of sophistication of these tunnels,

08:01.606 --> 08:03.338
of the equipment ISIS are using.

08:03.373 --> 08:06.809
The closer we get to Mosul, the more
sophisticated the tunnels will be

08:06.844 --> 08:09.044
and the longer it will take
to clear them.

08:20.456 --> 08:25.093
We just arrived in the recently recaptured
village of Ali Rash, just outside Mosul,

08:25.128 --> 08:27.428
with one of the generals
commanding this division.

08:27.463 --> 08:30.531
It's a bit of a press tour.
Most of the Iraqi TV crews

08:30.566 --> 08:32.767
are being taken
on a kind of PR tour.

08:41.376 --> 08:43.576
There's a few ISIS bodies
scattered around.

08:43.611 --> 08:48.148
An Iraqi media officer
is leading Iraqi journalists

08:48.183 --> 08:50.517
on a tour of ISIS corpses,

08:50.552 --> 08:53.819
uh, rotting around the courtyard
of a school here.

09:17.678 --> 09:20.511
Roussinos: <i> We're now in the
suburbs of Mosul.</i>

09:20.547 --> 09:23.882
You can hear an exchange of
fire, incoming and outgoing.

09:28.654 --> 09:30.954
Okay.

09:32.925 --> 09:35.192
Uh, when... Man: Whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

09:35.227 --> 09:36.727
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:36.762 --> 09:37.928
Ah-ah-ah.

09:37.963 --> 09:40.764
So, this is pretty much
the first house in Mosul

09:40.800 --> 09:42.332
to be taken over
by the Iraqi Army.

09:42.367 --> 09:44.667
The civilian inside has been
living here the whole time.

09:44.703 --> 09:46.836
He doesn't want to be interviewed
because he says his family

09:46.871 --> 09:50.339
still live just further on inside
what is still ISIS territory.

09:52.177 --> 09:53.676
<i>As troops closed in on the city,</i>

09:53.712 --> 09:57.446
<i>it became clear that the situation
was more precarious than expected.</i>

09:57.481 --> 09:59.082
<i>Districts they had claimed
to have liberated</i>

09:59.117 --> 10:02.684
<i>were still vulnerable
to ISIS counterattacks.</i>

10:02.720 --> 10:06.922
<i>It didn't take long until we found
ourselves in a similar situation.</i>

10:06.957 --> 10:08.656
We came under heavy ISIS fire
and we've basically

10:08.692 --> 10:10.458
been trapped here
for the past few hours.

10:16.834 --> 10:18.999
It's getting dark now,
our press trip to the front line

10:19.035 --> 10:22.002
has basically gone wrong.
We're still trapped here.

10:22.038 --> 10:23.704
The generals
are also trapped here,

10:23.740 --> 10:27.174
uh, trying to work out how we're
going to get out, essentially.

10:27.210 --> 10:28.943
It's not an ideal situation.

10:32.181 --> 10:36.950
<i>Ultimately, the generals decided to wait for
the cover of night to attempt to retreat.</i>

10:36.985 --> 10:39.352
We're making a mad dash
through the desert,

10:39.387 --> 10:41.320
lights off,
bumper-to-bumper,

10:41.356 --> 10:43.422
just trying
to not attract ISIS fire

10:43.458 --> 10:47.393
as we crawl our way back to the
relative safety of Ali Rash.

10:53.500 --> 10:56.534
<i>On the road back, we came across
an encampment of Mosul residents,</i>

10:56.570 --> 10:59.772
<i>fleeing the violence and desperate
for an end to the conflict.</i>

10:59.807 --> 11:04.109
<i>Hundreds of thousands have been displaced
since the offensive began in October.</i>

11:18.624 --> 11:21.558
Roussinos: <i>As coalition forces
make gains in liberating Mosul,</i>

11:21.594 --> 11:23.261
<i>and pushing ISIS out of Iraq,</i>

11:23.296 --> 11:25.996
<i>the looming question is,
"What will be left behind?"</i>

11:26.031 --> 11:29.732
<i>The toll on the nation's decimated
infrastructure and weakened state</i>

11:29.768 --> 11:33.403
<i>has ensured Iraq will remain
unstable for the foreseeable future.</i>

11:36.975 --> 11:38.341
The battle for Mosul

11:38.376 --> 11:40.710
and the purging
of the Islamic State from Iraq,

11:40.745 --> 11:44.046
<i>brings up the question of what the
country will actually look like</i>

11:44.081 --> 11:45.580
<i>fully liberated.</i>

11:45.616 --> 11:49.018
Now, Iraq has one of the youngest
populations of any country in the world,

11:49.053 --> 11:52.054
<i>with 50 percent
of Iraqis under 19.</i>

11:52.089 --> 11:54.957
<i>That means that the majority of
the people living there today</i>

11:54.992 --> 11:57.226
<i>have grown up
knowing nothing but war</i>

11:57.261 --> 12:00.761
<i>and the chaos that followed the
ousting of Saddam Hussein.</i>

12:00.797 --> 12:05.300
<i>This exact situation brought about the
growth of the Islamic State in Iraq</i>

12:05.335 --> 12:06.667
<i>in the first place.</i>

12:06.703 --> 12:08.937
So we sent Isobel Yeung
to Baghdad

12:08.972 --> 12:10.738
to find out what the future
looks like

12:10.773 --> 12:13.507
for a lost generation
of young Iraqis.

12:33.762 --> 12:35.895
What's it like to drive a bus
around Baghdad?

12:44.572 --> 12:46.138
Yeung:
Did you go to school?

12:48.709 --> 12:52.344
Yeung: <i>Sixteenyear-old Haider
works part-time as a bus driver,</i>

12:52.379 --> 12:54.846
<i>even though he doesn't yet
have his license.</i>

12:54.882 --> 12:57.115
And you've been driving since you were 15?
No one's stopped you?

13:01.654 --> 13:04.655
It sounds quite risky. What's the point?
Why are you still doing it?

13:14.733 --> 13:17.067
Yeung:
<i>Iraq's economy is in shambles.</i>

13:17.103 --> 13:18.468
<i>When Haider isn't driving a bus,</i>

13:18.504 --> 13:21.872
<i>he's doing what hundreds of
thousands of young Iraqi men</i>

13:21.908 --> 13:24.375
<i>wind up doing: Fighting.</i>

13:24.410 --> 13:28.177
<i>For the last two years, Haider has
fought with a local Shia militia</i>

13:28.213 --> 13:29.645
<i>against IS.</i>

13:29.680 --> 13:32.348
<i>And he's about to head
back out to the front lines.</i>

13:32.384 --> 13:33.516
Yeung:
This is your room?

13:35.020 --> 13:37.520
It's not what I imagined for
a fighter's room.

13:37.555 --> 13:40.489
I love your little
Care Bears up here.

13:40.525 --> 13:42.057
Do you miss it
when you're not here?

13:48.399 --> 13:50.265
Have you ever killed someone?

13:58.642 --> 14:00.241
Have you lost any friends?

14:13.522 --> 14:15.489
Yeung: Oh, this is
your friend who died?

14:16.891 --> 14:19.059
How do you feel
looking at these photos?

14:25.400 --> 14:26.732
Hmm.

14:26.768 --> 14:27.667
Wow.

14:27.702 --> 14:29.836
Oh, my God.
What's that?

14:32.974 --> 14:36.275
Why do you like to take
photos of the heads?

14:38.279 --> 14:41.480
Oh, my God.
That's pretty gruesome.

14:46.387 --> 14:48.354
Why did you take this photo?

14:53.626 --> 14:56.594
You don't mind your son having
these photos on his phone?

15:24.188 --> 15:26.355
Yeung: Do you feel like he's
missing out on anything

15:26.391 --> 15:28.524
by going off to fight
at such a young age?

15:40.371 --> 15:42.837
Yeung: <i>One of the country's
most tragic casualties</i>

15:42.872 --> 15:43.838
<i>to the disruption of war</i>

15:43.873 --> 15:47.175
<i>is the nation's once-thriving
education system.</i>

15:48.145 --> 15:50.111
<i>Under the dictatorship
of Saddam,</i>

15:50.147 --> 15:51.846
<i>schools were secular and free.</i>

15:51.881 --> 15:55.016
<i>Primary school enrollment
was nearly a hundred percent.</i>

15:56.253 --> 15:58.618
<i>But since the fighting began
in 2003,</i>

15:58.654 --> 16:00.554
<i>there have been
tens of thousands</i>

16:00.589 --> 16:02.256
<i>of education-related attacks,</i>

16:02.291 --> 16:06.626
<i>forcing one out of
every five schools to close.</i>

16:06.662 --> 16:09.530
<i>Over the last 15 years,
the city of Fallujah</i>

16:09.565 --> 16:12.499
<i>has seen some of the worst
violence in Iraq.</i>

16:12.535 --> 16:15.734
<i>We went there to see one of the
only schools that's been reopened</i>

16:15.770 --> 16:18.504
<i>since the area was reclaimed
from Islamic State.</i>

16:23.010 --> 16:24.444
Iraq used to have
one of the best

16:24.479 --> 16:26.645
education systems
in the Arab world,

16:26.681 --> 16:29.782
and now over a third of the kids
in the country are out of school

16:29.817 --> 16:31.350
and not receiving
any education at all.

16:31.386 --> 16:33.618
This is actually one of the
more fortunate schools.

16:33.653 --> 16:36.054
You can see, it's still
been pretty badly hit.

16:36.090 --> 16:37.822
There are hundreds of students
studying here,

16:37.857 --> 16:40.092
crammed into tiny
little classrooms.

16:40.127 --> 16:42.294
The teachers are saying that they
don't have enough text books,

16:42.329 --> 16:44.396
they don't have enough chairs
for the kids to sit on,

16:44.431 --> 16:47.132
and then they haven't received any
government support or funding.

16:49.502 --> 16:52.703
<i>As more and more students show
up at what's left of the school,</i>

16:52.738 --> 16:56.173
<i>the headmistress is scrambling to
accommodate as many as she can.</i>

17:20.031 --> 17:21.564
Yeung: Is it good to
be back at school?

17:24.901 --> 17:26.167
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:28.872 --> 17:30.972
Yeung: <i>More than a million
school-age children</i>

17:31.008 --> 17:34.109
<i>have been displaced since the
rise of the Islamic State.</i>

17:34.145 --> 17:35.910
How long have you been
at this school for?

17:37.648 --> 17:39.414
Why did you have to leave
this town?

18:16.116 --> 18:17.983
Yeung: <i>Even for the students
who are lucky enough</i>

18:18.018 --> 18:19.951
<i>to get some form
of an education,</i>

18:19.987 --> 18:23.055
<i>there are few opportunities
once they finish school.</i>

18:23.090 --> 18:28.093
<i>For younger adults, the unemployment
rate is estimated at almost 40 percent.</i>

18:28.128 --> 18:31.029
<i>Iraqi youth are so disillusioned
with the situation,</i>

18:31.065 --> 18:34.332
<i>that thousands have taken
to the streets in protest.</i>

18:34.367 --> 18:38.836
<i>In 2016, demonstrators stormed the
heavily guarded government green zone,</i>

18:38.871 --> 18:40.471
<i>demanding reforms.</i>

18:42.576 --> 18:46.744
<i>Months later, the protests in
Baghdad are still going on.</i>

18:52.351 --> 18:55.252
We're just in Tahrir Square,
where, for years now,

18:55.287 --> 18:56.820
hundreds, if not thousands,
of protesters

18:56.855 --> 18:58.755
have been showing up
every single Friday

18:58.790 --> 19:01.057
to express their dissatisfaction

19:01.093 --> 19:03.727
with corruption,
with lack of jobs,

19:03.762 --> 19:05.328
with a million different
grievances

19:05.363 --> 19:08.097
that young people
here in Iraq have.

20:06.220 --> 20:09.622
Yeung: <i> Billions of dollars have
disappeared from Iraq's economy</i>

20:09.658 --> 20:12.992
<i>due to corruption under Prime
Minister Nouri Al-Maliki,</i>

20:13.027 --> 20:15.226
<i>who the US helped put in power.</i>

20:15.262 --> 20:19.230
<i>Even now that Maliki's gone, the
economy is in worse shape than ever,</i>

20:19.266 --> 20:21.633
<i>and corruption is still rampant.</i>

20:21.669 --> 20:25.637
<i>To find out how top officials are
answering to these youth-led protests,</i>

20:25.673 --> 20:28.206
<i>we met with Iraq's
minister of youth.</i>

20:28.241 --> 20:32.209
Every Friday still, hundreds of
protesters gather in Tahrir Square.

20:32.244 --> 20:34.478
There's so much anger
amongst young people

20:34.514 --> 20:36.280
towards politicians
like yourself.

20:36.316 --> 20:39.417
Do you feel at all guilty that
you're sat here on this throne,

20:39.452 --> 20:41.719
earning one of the best
salaries in the country?

21:13.083 --> 21:14.683
What's at stake here
if the situation

21:14.719 --> 21:16.385
doesn't turn around
for young people in Iraq?

21:16.420 --> 21:18.487
What does the future
of the country look like?

21:38.940 --> 21:41.975
Yeung: <i>But there are certain
groups who have something to gain</i>

21:42.010 --> 21:45.111
<i>from the discontent
sweeping across Iraq.</i>

21:45.146 --> 21:48.982
<i>Sectarian militias, divided across
religious and political lines,</i>

21:49.017 --> 21:52.486
<i>are recruiting
at an alarming rate.</i>

21:52.521 --> 21:54.888
<i>We went to one front line
with a Suni militia leader,</i>

21:54.923 --> 21:58.591
<i>whose ranks are filled
with disenfranchised young men,</i>

21:58.626 --> 22:01.326
<i>eager to join the fight
against ISIS.</i>

22:01.362 --> 22:03.228
What's happening?

22:20.714 --> 22:22.947
Yeung: Woo! Yeah.

22:22.982 --> 22:24.215
Did that feel good?

22:27.153 --> 22:31.121
Do you often shoot the river?

22:41.867 --> 22:43.967
What were you doing before that?

22:46.771 --> 22:48.905
What would you be doing
if you weren't fighting?

22:51.175 --> 22:53.976
So you never went to school?

22:54.011 --> 22:56.446
How much longer do you think
you'll be fighting for?

22:58.382 --> 23:01.216
What do you think your country
will be like once ISIS has left?

23:06.757 --> 23:09.190
Do you guys fight
with any Shia militia?

23:18.902 --> 23:20.634
The sheikh doesn't agree?

23:35.150 --> 23:36.684
Yeung: Some of these
men are pretty young.

23:36.719 --> 23:38.585
What were you doing
when you were their age?

23:41.623 --> 23:44.423
Quite a different life to the
life that these young guys have.

23:44.459 --> 23:46.425
You've only recently
recruited these men.

23:46.461 --> 23:49.529
Was it easy to encourage
them to join up?

24:05.412 --> 24:08.113
Once ISIS is eradicated, do
you think that that's it?

24:08.148 --> 24:12.850
Or do you think that there might be more
tension between Shia and Sunni militias?

24:31.503 --> 24:34.137
Yeung: <i>It would seem that
the stage is already set</i>

24:34.172 --> 24:36.139
<i>for the next sectarian war,</i>

24:36.174 --> 24:38.374
<i>once Islamic State is gone.</i>

24:38.410 --> 24:39.576
<i>To make matters worse,</i>

24:39.611 --> 24:43.046
<i>religious leaders on both sides
are escalating the call to war</i>

24:43.081 --> 24:46.415
<i>amongst ever-younger
and impressionable kids.</i>

24:46.450 --> 24:49.652
<i>In 2014, Shia religious
clerics issued fatwas</i>

24:49.687 --> 24:54.623
<i>that made it a religious duty for
even children to take up arms.</i>

24:58.863 --> 25:00.829
<i>We met with one of the clerics
responsible</i>

25:00.865 --> 25:02.864
<i>in the Shia city of Najaf.</i>

25:03.833 --> 25:05.533
You yourself have issued a fatwa

25:05.569 --> 25:07.501
to encourage young men
to go and fight.

25:07.537 --> 25:09.904
Some of the people
who are going off to fight

25:09.940 --> 25:12.006
are just boys.
I've seen some of them.

25:12.042 --> 25:14.308
Do you think that they
can fully comprehend

25:14.343 --> 25:17.445
the magnitude of what they're
getting themselves into?

25:32.728 --> 25:35.062
You say it's easy for you,
but I also met the families

25:35.097 --> 25:38.197
of young boys
who are heading out to fight,

25:38.232 --> 25:40.432
and I don't think it would be
easy for them.

25:49.077 --> 25:52.044
You are talking about young people
like they're almost disposable.

25:52.080 --> 25:55.146
Is any age too young to go
and fight, do you think?

26:05.125 --> 26:07.525
Do you have any sons?

26:07.560 --> 26:10.894
Do they fight?

26:10.930 --> 26:14.231
It's quite convenient, though, that you
are asking other people's children

26:14.266 --> 26:16.700
to go and fight
and not asking your own.

26:33.118 --> 26:36.686
Yeung: <i> While more and more discontented
youth pour into the militias,</i>

26:36.721 --> 26:39.856
<i>the toll has already been
staggering.</i>

26:39.891 --> 26:42.258
<i>Some estimate that more
than a million Iraqis</i>

26:42.293 --> 26:44.793
<i>have been killed since 2003.</i>

26:45.929 --> 26:47.663
We're just in Najaf's cemetery,

26:47.698 --> 26:50.565
which is one of the largest
cemeteries in the world.

26:50.600 --> 26:53.869
Literally, as far as you can see,
it's just millions of graves.

26:53.904 --> 26:56.838
Looking at these photos,
everyone is so young.

26:56.874 --> 27:01.676
This whole area is cordoned off
for volunteers like Haider.

27:01.711 --> 27:04.779
Several of his friends
are buried here.

27:04.814 --> 27:07.682
<i>We visited the grave
of Haider's friend, Alawi,</i>

27:07.717 --> 27:10.217
<i>who was recently killed
in battle.</i>

27:25.934 --> 27:27.533
How old was he when he died?

27:32.240 --> 27:34.340
How many of your friends
are buried here?

27:43.851 --> 27:47.352
And how many more of your friends
do you think you'll be burying?

28:08.407 --> 28:11.341
Do you ever wish that you
grew up somewhere else

28:11.376 --> 28:15.078
and you didn't have to
go and fight in Iraq?
