00:00.970 --> 00:03.465
<i>Previously on Hell's Kitchen...</i>

00:03.466 --> 00:05.167
The final four
were all business...

00:05.168 --> 00:07.068
So close, I can taste it!

00:07.069 --> 00:09.805
When chef Ramsay
tested their creativity...

00:09.806 --> 00:11.706
Each of you will be given $15.

00:11.707 --> 00:13.742
In the "Profit Margin"
challenge.

00:13.743 --> 00:15.677
Good luck. Why don't they move
that fast at service?

00:15.678 --> 00:17.345
Dana proved quality...

00:17.346 --> 00:19.381
Five ounces
of halibut, please...

00:19.382 --> 00:21.283
Is a lot more
important than quantity.

00:21.284 --> 00:22.517
How much would you pay?

00:22.518 --> 00:25.023
<i>I would spend $32.
$32.</i>

00:25.024 --> 00:26.154
$38 would be what
I would pay for it.

00:26.155 --> 00:27.622
Dana, congratulations.

00:27.623 --> 00:29.291
Thank you.
Thank you.

00:29.292 --> 00:30.859
Yeah!

00:30.860 --> 00:33.161
In the most
crucial dinner service yet...

00:33.162 --> 00:35.096
Tonight we separate
the cooks from the chefs.

00:35.097 --> 00:37.632
Chef Ramsay tested
the chefs' leadership abilities.

00:37.633 --> 00:39.134
<i>Each of you will have a turn</i>

00:39.135 --> 00:41.870
running the pass.

00:41.871 --> 00:44.306
Justin took
control of the kitchen early.

00:44.307 --> 00:45.874
Let's go, VIP table!

00:45.875 --> 00:47.642
Entree... two bass,
two Wellington, two strip!

00:47.643 --> 00:49.544
Two Wellington,
two strip, heard!

00:49.545 --> 00:51.079
But was frustrated by Dana.

00:51.080 --> 00:52.547
Where's those bass?
Three minutes.

00:52.548 --> 00:54.082
I need it now.
We're dying.

00:54.083 --> 00:56.117
It's gonna be ready
when it's ready.

00:56.118 --> 00:57.252
<i>Dana, answer me!</i>

00:57.253 --> 00:59.554
Justin's being so annoying.

00:59.555 --> 01:01.156
How long?
Six minutes!

01:01.157 --> 01:03.158
Dana's dragging on fish
and doesn't care.

01:03.159 --> 01:04.426
When it was Dana's turn...

01:04.427 --> 01:05.961
Order in!

01:05.962 --> 01:07.863
She successfully
pushed food out to the diners.

01:07.864 --> 01:09.297
Coming down.
Cod is going.

01:09.298 --> 01:10.632
Service, please.

01:10.633 --> 01:12.334
But she had a setback

01:12.335 --> 01:13.802
with one of her
quality-control tests.

01:13.803 --> 01:15.437
Stop. Taste that.

01:15.438 --> 01:17.105
Oh. Yeah, it's made
with sugar.

01:17.106 --> 01:19.107
I'm an idiot.
I should have tasted it.

01:19.108 --> 01:20.742
Barbie got off
to an unusual start...

01:20.743 --> 01:22.777
Order in!
One risotto, one scallop!

01:22.778 --> 01:25.614
Barbie, we can't hear you
when you're not looking at us!

01:25.615 --> 01:26.848
I'm so confused.

01:26.849 --> 01:29.718
And had difficulty
gaining control of the kitchen.

01:29.719 --> 01:31.419
I need a salad from you,
and I need scallops from you.

01:31.420 --> 01:32.854
Yes.
What the hell?

01:32.855 --> 01:34.322
Train wreck.

01:34.323 --> 01:35.357
Train wreck!

01:35.358 --> 01:36.625
I need those scallops!

01:36.626 --> 01:38.460
They're coming right now!

01:38.461 --> 01:40.195
During Christina's
turn at the pass...

01:40.196 --> 01:41.596
Dana, is your fish
looking okay?

01:41.597 --> 01:43.531
<i>Give me two minutes, please.
Dana, come on, buddy.</i>

01:43.532 --> 01:45.233
Her friendship
with Dana was tested.

01:45.234 --> 01:46.835
Forget the friendship.
Let's go.

01:46.836 --> 01:48.036
Dana, push that.
I need 60 seconds!

01:48.037 --> 01:49.771
<i>Hurry up!
Make it 45, Dana, come on!</i>

01:49.772 --> 01:51.039
Walking with cod!

01:51.040 --> 01:53.041
This is a competition.
I want to win.

01:53.042 --> 01:55.543
At elimination,
chef Ramsay surprised everyone.

01:55.544 --> 01:57.579
The next service
in Hell's Kitchen...

01:57.580 --> 01:59.614
Is the final.

01:59.615 --> 02:01.950
Tonight two of you
are going home.

02:01.951 --> 02:04.019
The first chef to leave was...

02:04.020 --> 02:05.654
Barbie, please give me
your jacket.

02:05.655 --> 02:07.856
And then chef Ramsay was faced

02:07.857 --> 02:10.625
with his most important
and difficult decision yet.

02:10.626 --> 02:13.695
There's a fraction separating
all three of you.

02:13.696 --> 02:16.431
Find out right
now who the finalists are...

02:16.432 --> 02:17.666

02:17.667 --> 02:19.534

02:19.535 --> 02:21.069
<i>to the Hell's Kitchen final...</i>

02:21.070 --> 02:22.203
Is...

02:22.204 --> 02:24.005
As the finale to decide

02:24.006 --> 02:26.007
<i>who will be the winner
of Hell's Kitchen begins</i>

<i>And now the
continuation of Hell's Kitchen.</i>

03:30.406 --> 03:33.408
<i>When I look
at the three of you,</i>

03:33.409 --> 03:35.276
this is where it gets
really hard,

03:35.277 --> 03:36.678
<i>really difficult,</i>

03:36.679 --> 03:39.314
<i>because there's a fraction</i>

And, honestly, I could see
all three of you

03:44.053 --> 03:45.353
<i>in Hell's Kitchen final.</i>

03:47.957 --> 03:50.091
But there can only be two.

03:55.631 --> 03:57.098
Holy .

04:01.137 --> 04:03.671
The first chef going through

04:03.672 --> 04:05.407
<i>to the Hell's Kitchen final</i>

04:05.408 --> 04:07.342
is...

04:10.324 --> 04:12.514
Christina.
Congratulations.

04:12.515 --> 04:14.182
Congratulations, Chris.

04:14.183 --> 04:15.683
Oh, my God.
Thanks, man.

04:15.684 --> 04:17.385
Thank you, chef.
Oh, my God.

04:17.386 --> 04:19.220
Thank you.

04:19.221 --> 04:21.122
Congratulations.
Good job.

04:21.123 --> 04:22.557
Thank you.
Great job.

04:22.558 --> 04:23.725
<i>Oh, wow.</i>

04:23.726 --> 04:24.893
<i>Congratulations.</i>

04:28.130 --> 04:29.497
Justin and Dana...

04:29.498 --> 04:31.066
Yes, chef.
Yes, chef.

04:31.067 --> 04:33.168
Both of you have had
great accomplishments

04:33.169 --> 04:35.170
<i>in this competition.</i>

04:35.171 --> 04:37.539
But there's only one spot left.

04:39.275 --> 04:40.875
The second person...

04:40.876 --> 04:43.311
<i>Going through to the final
of Hell's Kitchen...</i>

04:46.215 --> 04:47.949

04:51.880 --> 04:54.923
Justin.
Congratulations.

04:54.924 --> 04:56.958
<i>Chef.
Well done.</i>

04:56.959 --> 04:58.226
Well done, well done.

04:58.227 --> 05:00.929
I love you, buddy.
Love you.

05:00.930 --> 05:02.497
Sorry, Dana.
I'm sorry.

05:02.498 --> 05:03.865
Good luck.
Thank you.

05:03.866 --> 05:05.066
Come here, you.

05:05.067 --> 05:07.569
You hold that head up high.

05:07.570 --> 05:09.938
<i>You have
an extraordinary palate.</i>

05:09.939 --> 05:11.673
<i>But you're not ready
right now...</i>

05:11.674 --> 05:13.241
Yes, chef.
To become the chef

05:13.242 --> 05:15.643
at Gordon Ramsay Steak
in Vegas.

05:15.644 --> 05:16.945
Do me a big favor.

05:16.946 --> 05:18.113
Keep that jacket.

05:18.114 --> 05:19.114
Thank you, chef.

05:19.115 --> 05:20.115
Okay?
Thank you.

05:20.116 --> 05:21.282
Well done.

05:21.283 --> 05:22.917
Well done, well done,
well done.

05:22.918 --> 05:24.452
I mean, really good job.
Thank you.

05:24.453 --> 05:26.321
Great job, Dana.
Good job, buddy.

05:26.322 --> 05:28.223
<i>I love you so much.
Good luck, guys.</i>

05:28.224 --> 05:29.557
<i>Well done, Dana...</i>

05:29.558 --> 05:30.925
Thank you, chef.

05:30.926 --> 05:32.961
<i>Hell's Kitchen has been
so much harder</i>

05:32.962 --> 05:35.396
than I ever thought
it was gonna be.

05:35.397 --> 05:37.098
It's like canned soup.

05:37.099 --> 05:40.001
But I have to say that
I think I did pretty well.

05:40.002 --> 05:42.137
I think I'm gonna go
with the meatballs.

05:42.138 --> 05:43.705
<i>Congratulations, Dana.
There you go, Dana.</i>

05:43.706 --> 05:45.907
I have Michelin starred chefs

05:45.908 --> 05:47.575
who have tasted my dishes...

05:47.576 --> 05:49.277
It was great.
Everything on the dish works.

05:49.278 --> 05:51.246
And told me how amazing
they are.

05:51.247 --> 05:52.814
And, you know, I can leave here

05:52.815 --> 05:54.315
and say I got to serve
David Beckham.

05:54.316 --> 05:55.550
Dana and Clemenza,
congratulations.

05:55.551 --> 05:56.885
Yes!
Aah!

05:56.886 --> 05:58.720
These are all moments
that are priceless,

05:58.721 --> 06:00.054
and I'm just gonna
take these away.

06:00.055 --> 06:01.823
<i>And even though
I'm leaving Hell's Kitchen,</i>

06:01.824 --> 06:03.525
I'm leaving
with my head held high.

06:03.526 --> 06:05.093
And I know one thing,

06:05.094 --> 06:06.861
and that's
I'll never stop cooking.

06:06.862 --> 06:08.530
You've made it!

06:08.531 --> 06:09.864
Congratulations to you both.

06:09.865 --> 06:11.032
Thank you, chef.

06:11.033 --> 06:12.901
Yeah, final two!

06:12.902 --> 06:16.137
I wanted to jump on the tables,
just like...Aah!

06:16.138 --> 06:17.205
Oh, my God.

06:17.206 --> 06:19.307
<i>One of you will be</i>

06:19.308 --> 06:21.876
the head chef
at Gordon Ramsay Steak.

06:21.877 --> 06:24.812
For these next 48 hours,
it's gonna be huge.

06:24.813 --> 06:27.015
Tonight I want you both
to start thinking

06:27.016 --> 06:28.183
of your menu...

06:28.184 --> 06:29.884
a winning menu...
Yes, chef.

06:29.885 --> 06:30.985
Yes, chef.

06:30.986 --> 06:33.188
With four stunning appetizers,

06:33.189 --> 06:35.523
four stunning entrees,

06:35.524 --> 06:37.492
and three desserts.

06:37.493 --> 06:39.928
Now...
Start those menus.

06:39.929 --> 06:41.429
You got it, chef.
Thank you, chef.

06:41.430 --> 06:43.031
Come on, buddy.
Let's do it.

06:43.032 --> 06:45.133
Can't believe it...
final two, man.

06:47.136 --> 06:49.804
16 gone, done,
see you later...

06:49.805 --> 06:51.139
only two left.

06:51.140 --> 06:53.208
Justin, holy .
I can't believe it.

06:53.209 --> 06:54.976
I just have one person to beat,

06:54.977 --> 06:56.678
and I'm the new chef
at Gordon Ramsay Steak...

06:56.679 --> 06:59.180
Las Vegas, baby.

06:59.181 --> 07:01.849
We knocked out 16 people!

07:01.850 --> 07:03.284
16!

07:03.285 --> 07:05.753
What a ride, man.

07:05.754 --> 07:07.589
Cheers, buddy.
Cheers, man.

07:07.590 --> 07:10.325
Take 'em to flavor country.

07:11.827 --> 07:13.494
With the biggest
dinner service of their lives

07:13.495 --> 07:14.829
ahead of them,

07:14.830 --> 07:16.798
Justin and Christina
get straight to work

07:16.799 --> 07:18.800
on their menus.

07:18.801 --> 07:21.569
My father's gonna be
so proud of me.

07:21.570 --> 07:23.104
It's crazy.

07:23.105 --> 07:25.306
When I was deciding
that I wanted to be a chef,

07:25.307 --> 07:27.108
being that my father's a chef,
he always doubted me.

07:27.109 --> 07:28.810
He was always like,
"this is not for you."

07:28.811 --> 07:30.278
You know, now that I'm
in the final two,

07:30.279 --> 07:31.779
you know, I want to show him
what I made of myself.

07:31.780 --> 07:34.015
That's really important to me.

07:34.016 --> 07:36.884
I definitely want to see myself
represented in my menu.

07:36.885 --> 07:38.586
I cooked, basically,
my whole life.

07:38.587 --> 07:40.188
For years, it was me, my mom,

07:40.189 --> 07:41.656
and my grandmother
in the kitchen.

07:41.657 --> 07:43.391
I learned a lot from them,

07:43.392 --> 07:45.226
and I just need to put my heart
out on those plates

07:45.227 --> 07:47.128
and, um, let it pay off.

07:47.129 --> 07:49.464
Cheers to you again, buddy.
Night, Chris.

07:49.465 --> 07:52.133
After a late night
working on their menus...

07:55.904 --> 07:58.273
Both chefs are up early...

07:58.274 --> 08:00.508
We have a lot
of work ahead of us.

08:01.944 --> 08:03.511
And eager to
get into the kitchen.

08:07.082 --> 08:08.650
<i>Hello?
I need to see you</i>

08:08.651 --> 08:10.718
and Justin
in my office, please.

08:10.719 --> 08:13.454
But chef Ramsay
has other plans for them.

08:13.455 --> 08:15.390
We have to go to chef's office.

08:15.391 --> 08:17.825
Chef Ramsay's office?
Yeah, that was chef Ramsay.

08:17.826 --> 08:19.727
When I get that phone
call, I'm a little bit nervous.

08:19.728 --> 08:21.496
We have a lot of work to do

08:21.497 --> 08:23.965
to get our menu ready
for service tomorrow.

08:23.966 --> 08:26.501
And you never know
what's behind any doors here.

08:26.502 --> 08:27.869
<i>Oh, wow.
Come in.</i>

08:27.870 --> 08:29.203
Right, good morning.
How are you?

08:29.204 --> 08:30.638
Good morning, chef.
Great.

08:30.639 --> 08:32.073
<i>Are you well?
Yes, thank you.</i>

08:32.073 --> 08:33.174
Well rested? Please take a seat.
Yes, chef.

08:33.174 --> 08:34.174
So...

08:34.176 --> 08:36.644
Today it was absolutely crucial

08:36.645 --> 08:38.145
that you go through
every little detail

08:38.147 --> 08:39.681
with your sous chefs

08:39.682 --> 08:41.482
in order to get ahead
of tomorrow night's service.

08:41.482 --> 08:43.083
Yes, chef.
Yes, chef.

08:43.085 --> 08:44.786
There's only problem.

08:44.787 --> 08:47.488
Unfortunately...

08:47.489 --> 08:49.590
Andi and Scott are not here.

08:49.591 --> 08:51.693
Oh, man.

08:51.694 --> 08:53.628
I don't even know what to say.
I don't know what to do.

08:53.629 --> 08:55.063
It's like a blow
to the stomach.

08:55.064 --> 08:56.898
They're waiting for you.

08:57.933 --> 08:59.167
<i>Where?
Where?</i>

09:08.757 --> 09:10.891
Less than 48 hours away

09:10.892 --> 09:13.794
from the biggest dinner service
of Christina and Justin's lives,

09:13.795 --> 09:15.830
chef Ramsay...
There's only one problem.

09:15.831 --> 09:17.631
Has some interesting news
for the finalists.

09:17.632 --> 09:19.300
Andi and Scott are not here.

09:22.104 --> 09:24.205
They're waiting for you.

09:24.206 --> 09:25.906
Where?

09:25.907 --> 09:27.108
Where?

09:27.109 --> 09:28.943
Poolside, Las Vegas.

09:28.944 --> 09:31.112
Ohh!

09:31.113 --> 09:33.147
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

09:33.148 --> 09:35.049
We're going to Vegas?
This is crazy.

09:35.050 --> 09:37.017
I've arranged for you to have
a day of pampering,

09:37.018 --> 09:40.087
but there's still meetings
with Scott and Andi.

09:40.088 --> 09:42.156
But, hey, you'll be
doing those meetings poolside

09:42.157 --> 09:43.290
in your private cabanas.

09:43.291 --> 09:45.059
Thank you so much, chef.

09:45.060 --> 09:47.128
I need a day of relaxation
more than anything in the world.

09:47.129 --> 09:48.596
I really haven't been able
to sit back

09:48.597 --> 09:49.997
and just take it all in

09:49.998 --> 09:51.665
and think about
where I am right now,

09:51.666 --> 09:52.500
and this is the perfect day
to do that.

09:52.501 --> 09:53.934
Now, get packed,

09:53.935 --> 09:56.704
'cause our private plane
is literally wheels up...

09:56.705 --> 09:58.339
Okay.
In 60 minutes.

09:58.340 --> 09:59.840
Off you go.
Let's go.

09:59.841 --> 10:01.976
<i>I'm going to Vegas, baby.
Adios.</i>

10:07.215 --> 10:08.916
Holy .

10:08.917 --> 10:10.885
<i>Justin, Christina, welcome.</i>

10:10.886 --> 10:12.086
Jump on board.

10:12.087 --> 10:14.221
<i>Your VIP day
starts here.</i>

10:14.222 --> 10:15.456
<i>Let's go.</i>

10:15.457 --> 10:17.091
Good morning,
and welcome aboard.

10:18.727 --> 10:20.094
Cheers.
Congratulations.

10:20.095 --> 10:21.428
Thank you very much.
Well done.

10:21.429 --> 10:22.763
It's so amazing...
the jet, the champagne,

10:22.764 --> 10:24.465
the time with chef Ramsay,
the finals.

10:24.466 --> 10:25.866
I feel on top of the world.

10:25.867 --> 10:27.501
<i>Enjoy this moment...</i>

10:27.502 --> 10:29.470
<i>Yeah.
'Cause you've earned it.</i>

10:29.471 --> 10:31.372
<i>Think of the journey.
It's starting to sink in,</i>

10:31.373 --> 10:33.107
<i>is it?
Exactly how far we've come</i>

10:33.108 --> 10:34.608
and how much
that fight is worth.

10:34.609 --> 10:36.610
I've come a long way
to get here.

10:36.611 --> 10:38.879
And I've been through
a pretty bad drama

10:38.880 --> 10:40.047
from day one.

10:40.048 --> 10:41.482
Get the out of my face!

10:41.483 --> 10:43.050
I'm not getting in your face!

10:43.051 --> 10:44.285
Stupid bitch! Don't even
get me ghetto, Kimmie!

10:44.286 --> 10:45.953
Stop. Stop.

10:45.954 --> 10:47.721
You know, I had to really
just put my heart

10:47.722 --> 10:49.089
out on the plate every time.

10:49.090 --> 10:50.257
You cooked
a lobster beautifully.

10:50.258 --> 10:51.392
Bravo.
It was delicious.

10:51.393 --> 10:52.660
Yay!

10:52.661 --> 10:54.061
Our first three-star...
Christina, great job.

10:54.062 --> 10:55.062
Thank you, chef.

10:55.063 --> 10:56.497
But, uh, it's made me stronger,

10:56.498 --> 10:57.865
it's made me better
as a leader.

10:57.866 --> 10:59.500
Barbie, how long do you need?

10:59.501 --> 11:01.035
Two minutes.
Dana, I'll see you in 2 1/2 minutes!

11:01.036 --> 11:02.903
Finally, a voice
on the ...

11:02.904 --> 11:04.738
I'm glad that I just
kept that fight alive,

11:04.739 --> 11:06.140
and here I stand.

11:06.141 --> 11:08.008
So I got one more
present for you.

11:10.145 --> 11:12.046
Oh, .

11:12.047 --> 11:13.514
Christina, this is yours.

11:13.515 --> 11:14.682
<i>Justin, that's yours.</i>

11:14.683 --> 11:15.950
Thank you, chef.

11:15.951 --> 11:17.218
And something
that I think will be

11:17.219 --> 11:18.419
<i>fitting for tomorrow night.</i>

11:19.988 --> 11:21.822
Ohh...
Wow. Wow.

11:21.823 --> 11:23.991
It means the world to me
to get that jacket.

11:23.992 --> 11:25.426
<i>Hell's Kitchen has been</i>

11:25.427 --> 11:27.061
a life-changing experience
for me.

11:27.062 --> 11:28.996
In the beginning, my strategy
was just to remain focused.

11:28.997 --> 11:31.031
Chef, filet coming at you
right now, chef!

11:31.032 --> 11:33.000
Head down and just do
what I do best and cook.

11:33.001 --> 11:34.668
<i>Here's your filet, chef.</i>

11:34.669 --> 11:36.670
Thank you. Those filet
were cooked beautifully.

11:36.671 --> 11:38.372
Every challenge I won,
I started to feel

11:38.373 --> 11:40.074
more confident
about my ability.

11:40.075 --> 11:42.075
Tastes nice.
You've nailed the seasoning.

11:42.677 --> 11:43.677
Sunchoke.

11:43.678 --> 11:44.912
Yeah!

11:44.913 --> 11:46.981
You have
an extraordinary palate.

11:46.982 --> 11:48.482
It took a little
while, but I found my voice.

11:48.483 --> 11:49.750
She can't drive it.
Can you drive it?

11:49.751 --> 11:51.619
Yes, chef.
How long for those tables?

11:51.620 --> 11:52.953
Five minutes on that next table...
Thank you.

11:52.954 --> 11:54.521
After this one goes out first.
Finally.

11:54.522 --> 11:55.923
I've been fighting
as hard as I possibly can

11:55.924 --> 11:58.559
every single day,
and I got a lot more in me.

11:58.560 --> 12:00.427
One more question...
Who's gonna win?

12:00.428 --> 12:01.495
I am, chef.
I am.

12:01.496 --> 12:04.298
That was a draw.

12:04.299 --> 12:06.433
Welcome to Vegas.

12:13.141 --> 12:14.441
Oh, boy.

12:15.810 --> 12:17.645
With less than 40 hours

12:17.646 --> 12:19.713
until the stressful
final dinner service,

12:19.714 --> 12:21.949
chef Ramsay has arranged
for Christina and Justin

12:21.950 --> 12:23.984
to have a little
relaxing time...

12:23.985 --> 12:25.619
I'm loving it.
That's awesome.

12:25.620 --> 12:27.187
And enjoy the rewards

12:27.188 --> 12:29.156
<i>of being Hell's Kitchen finalists.
Yeah, I'm happy.</i>

12:29.157 --> 12:31.292
I'm glad my hands are getting
a little bit of love today.

12:31.293 --> 12:32.493
They're gonna be
busy as hell tomorrow.

12:32.494 --> 12:34.228
Justin, how are you?

12:34.229 --> 12:36.263
<i>Hey, chef, how are you?
I'm doing really well.</i>

12:36.264 --> 12:37.331
I'm sorry I'm gonna
have to interrupt this.

12:37.332 --> 12:38.766
We have a little bit
of work to do.

12:38.767 --> 12:40.367
Chef Scott rolls
into my cabana,

12:40.368 --> 12:41.735
and it was
a really awkward moment.

12:41.736 --> 12:43.003
I'm sitting there in a robe

12:43.004 --> 12:44.672
in front of my chef,
who's wearing his whites.

12:44.673 --> 12:45.706
Sorry about being in a robe.
It's a little awkward.

12:45.707 --> 12:47.207
Yeah, it is a little weird.

12:47.208 --> 12:48.776
Little awkward right now,
honestly, I'm not gonna lie.

12:48.777 --> 12:50.177
At least you're wearing shorts.

12:50.178 --> 12:51.779
Can we get down to business?

12:51.780 --> 12:53.781
Are you guys all set?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:53.782 --> 12:55.783
As Justin and Christina
transition from relaxation...

12:55.784 --> 12:56.951
Are you ready?

12:56.952 --> 12:58.485
To preparation...

12:58.486 --> 13:00.254
I need you to take me
through menu items.

13:00.255 --> 13:02.222
Dover sole... I mean, that's
the king of all fish to me.

13:02.223 --> 13:03.958
Chef Scott and chef Andi

13:03.959 --> 13:05.225
advise them on where
to play it safe...

13:05.226 --> 13:07.594
So the first one
was boneless beef short ribs.

13:07.595 --> 13:09.296
This is more, like,
heavy, like, you...

13:09.297 --> 13:10.998
kind of like, you know,
east coaster.

13:10.999 --> 13:12.700
You know, obviously,
I want to see myself in it.

13:12.701 --> 13:14.468
And where to take risks.

13:14.469 --> 13:16.003
I wanted to do lamb,
but I'm really...

13:16.004 --> 13:17.571
I'm really scared to do it.

13:17.572 --> 13:18.939
The short ribs
are almost like a cop-out.

13:18.940 --> 13:20.323
You're not really going
balls to the wall.

13:20.324 --> 13:21.719
You're not really putting
yourself on the line.

13:21.720 --> 13:23.948
You ultimately have the control
over the quality too.

13:23.949 --> 13:24.894
Don't forget that.

13:24.895 --> 13:26.347
So I think I'll go with rack of lamb,
for sure.

13:26.348 --> 13:28.549
And it's more me.
All right, man.

13:28.550 --> 13:29.883
Well, best of luck to you.
All right, chef. Thank you very much.

13:29.884 --> 13:30.884
Thank you.

13:33.488 --> 13:35.222
With their menus in order...

13:35.223 --> 13:37.524
Now that all
that work's done...

13:37.525 --> 13:39.493
Chef Ramsay has a special
treat in store for the finalists.

13:39.494 --> 13:41.362
One more little surprise.
You hungry?

13:41.363 --> 13:42.730
Yes, chef.
Yes, chef.

13:42.731 --> 13:44.064
This place is famed
for its food.

13:44.065 --> 13:46.000
Let's go.
Okay.

13:46.001 --> 13:48.502
Gentlemen, please.
Thank you.

13:48.503 --> 13:50.104
Aah! Ha ha!

13:51.339 --> 13:52.840
Chef Ramsay pulls
the curtain back,

13:52.841 --> 13:54.174
and I saw my mother
and my father.

13:54.175 --> 13:55.743
I couldn't believe it.
It was like a mirage.

13:55.744 --> 13:56.744
Then it really hit me
that they were here.

13:56.745 --> 13:58.212
They were in Vegas with me.

13:58.213 --> 13:59.580
You know, it's a great feeling.

13:59.581 --> 14:01.515
You surprised?
Yeah, very. Very.

14:02.617 --> 14:03.951
Hi, mama!

14:03.952 --> 14:05.953
Having my mom and my girl
there for lunch,

14:05.954 --> 14:07.921
it's exactly what I needed.

14:07.922 --> 14:10.357
Uh, right, Justin, Christina,
nice surprise?

14:10.358 --> 14:12.559
Yes, I'm so surprised.
Absolutely, chef. Thank you very much.

14:12.560 --> 14:14.061
I look forward
to seeing you later,

14:14.062 --> 14:15.729
where you've got
VIP tickets

14:15.730 --> 14:17.164
for the most amazing show.

14:17.165 --> 14:19.099
But now just sit back
and relax.

14:19.100 --> 14:20.267
I'll relax if you relax.

14:20.268 --> 14:21.969
I'll try my hardest.

14:21.970 --> 14:23.837
To see my in the final two
means the world to my family,

14:23.838 --> 14:25.372
especially my father...
knowing the business

14:25.373 --> 14:26.440
and knowing what I've been
through my whole life

14:26.441 --> 14:27.408
of how much I worked.

14:27.409 --> 14:28.909
So proud, Josh.
Thank you.

14:28.910 --> 14:31.645
They're so proud.
You know, it's amazing.

14:31.646 --> 14:33.380
<i>It's really been a long road,
and it's been a struggle,</i>

14:33.381 --> 14:34.748
<i>but, really,</i>

14:34.749 --> 14:36.617
you know, it goes to show you
who you are

14:36.618 --> 14:38.152
and what you're made of
and how much you can handle,

14:38.153 --> 14:39.920
<i>how much you can take.
Mm-hmm.</i>

14:39.921 --> 14:41.121
It's unreal.

14:41.122 --> 14:42.689
Cheers, mama.
I'm in the finals.

14:42.690 --> 14:44.758
I don't know if you
know this or not.

14:44.759 --> 14:47.061
This is such a nice break,
being able to sit down in Vegas

14:47.062 --> 14:48.429
with my mom and Sara.

14:48.430 --> 14:50.064
I'm reminded of what I left,

14:50.065 --> 14:51.932
and I got a whole new
fight inside of me.

14:51.933 --> 14:53.434
And I'm ready
to win this thing.

14:53.435 --> 14:54.535
Here we go.
To the finals.

14:54.536 --> 14:55.869
Finally, the finals.

14:55.870 --> 14:57.604
Yeah.

15:04.612 --> 15:06.580
The entire day has been great.

15:06.581 --> 15:08.649
I've gotten to have this time
with my family.

15:08.650 --> 15:11.952
We're going to a Vegas show
but I can't stop thinking,

15:11.953 --> 15:13.821
"is this really happening
right now?"

15:13.822 --> 15:16.623
Like, chef rarely
makes it easy for us.

15:16.624 --> 15:19.293
I've got the most amazing seats

15:19.294 --> 15:21.228
to see this amazing show...
Penn & Teller.

15:22.764 --> 15:24.698
Sit back, relax,
and enjoy the show.

15:24.699 --> 15:27.835
<i>And I'll see you
after the show for a drink.</i>

15:27.836 --> 15:30.237
Ladies and gentlemen,
lease give a warm welcome

15:30.238 --> 15:33.107
to Las Vegas magicians
and Rio headliners

15:33.108 --> 15:34.308
Penn & Teller!

15:36.077 --> 15:38.011
I would love to
be happy and enjoy myself,

15:38.012 --> 15:39.847
<i>but this is Hell's Kitchen.</i>

15:39.848 --> 15:41.715
There's no such thing
as chilling out and relaxing.

15:41.716 --> 15:43.050
The minute you start to relax
for a second, boom...

15:43.051 --> 15:44.818
you get nailed with something.

15:44.819 --> 15:46.553
<i>Good evening!</i>

15:46.554 --> 15:48.722
Chef Ramsay... I know that he has
a trick up his sleeve.

15:48.723 --> 15:52.826
Now, if I asked all of you to
name one of the effects in magic

15:52.827 --> 15:54.394
that you'd like to see,

15:54.395 --> 15:58.398
certainly one
of the iconic images of magic

15:58.399 --> 16:01.602
is sawing a human being
in half.

16:01.603 --> 16:03.437
That's it.
That's the surprise.

16:03.438 --> 16:05.372
We're gonna get sawed in half.

16:05.373 --> 16:07.407
<i>But we're also gonna
show you how it's done</i>

16:07.408 --> 16:08.675
so you can do it
when you get home

16:08.676 --> 16:10.377
<i>at parties.</i>

16:13.248 --> 16:16.717
Oh, yeah.
Oh, I hit a good part there.

16:16.718 --> 16:17.818
<i>Separated</i>

16:17.819 --> 16:20.154
into two pieces right there.

16:20.155 --> 16:22.055
Two halves...
teller is separated.

16:22.056 --> 16:26.593
That is sawing a human being
into halves.

16:26.594 --> 16:28.428
<i>Now, if you want
to do this at home,</i>

16:28.429 --> 16:30.030
when you build the rig,

16:30.031 --> 16:32.566
just make sure you build
the top box big enough

16:32.567 --> 16:34.368
<i>for your partner to fit in.</i>

16:34.369 --> 16:36.470
And this is the important part.

16:36.471 --> 16:37.971
You find someone backstage

16:37.972 --> 16:41.275
who's not doin' nothin'.

16:41.276 --> 16:42.976
Ah, yeah!

16:42.977 --> 16:44.711
And you ask him

16:44.712 --> 16:48.048
if he could play the part
of the feet.

16:48.049 --> 16:49.683
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
Gordon Ramsay!</i>

16:49.684 --> 16:51.418
<i>Hell's Kitchen right there!</i>

16:52.720 --> 16:54.521
Ladies and gentlemen,
Penn & Teller!

16:54.522 --> 16:55.956
<i>Incredible!</i>

16:55.957 --> 16:59.626
Right now I would like to turn
the spotlight...

17:02.797 --> 17:06.233
<i>On our two
Hell's Kitchen finalists...</i>

17:06.233 --> 17:07.634
Whoa, what the
is going on?

17:07.635 --> 17:09.670
<i>Because right now</i>

17:09.671 --> 17:11.672
it's time...

17:11.673 --> 17:13.339
For their final challenge.

17:13.340 --> 17:14.441
No way.

17:15.877 --> 17:17.844
Please, please, chef,

17:17.845 --> 17:19.479
don't let us be cooking
our menu right here, right now.

17:19.480 --> 17:20.881
I'm dying here.

17:20.882 --> 17:23.550
Christina and Justin,
please come up here!

17:23.550 --> 17:24.685
<i>.
Let's go!</i>

17:26.186 --> 17:28.355
This sucks.
Chef Ramsay's out of his mind.

17:28.356 --> 17:29.456
I do not want to go
on that stage right now...

17:29.457 --> 17:31.792
no way.

17:39.710 --> 17:41.645
After a whirlwind day in Vegas,

17:41.646 --> 17:44.414
Justin, Christina, and
their families take in a show

17:44.415 --> 17:46.416
starring magicians
Penn & Teller.

17:46.417 --> 17:49.853
But chef Ramsay
has a few tricks of his own.

17:49.854 --> 17:51.554
I would like to turn
the spotlight...

17:55.693 --> 17:58.762
<i>On our two
Hell's Kitchen finalists.</i>

17:58.763 --> 18:01.231
It's time for their
final challenge.

18:01.232 --> 18:03.099
<i>.
Christina and Justin,</i>

18:03.100 --> 18:05.602
please come up here!
Let's go.

18:05.603 --> 18:08.204
I don't know what
idiot pill I took this morning,

18:08.205 --> 18:11.241
but to think that chef Ramsay
was actually gonna give us

18:11.242 --> 18:12.976
a day off...
I should have known.

18:12.977 --> 18:14.477
I definitely
should have known better.

18:15.980 --> 18:17.414
Christina, Justin,
did you honestly think

18:17.415 --> 18:18.481
you'll come to Vegas
just for fun?

18:18.482 --> 18:19.883
I was hoping.
Yes.

18:21.385 --> 18:22.886
Unfortunately, you didn't
realize you are the show!

18:22.887 --> 18:23.887
Ohh.

18:25.556 --> 18:27.791
For your final challenge,

18:27.792 --> 18:30.393
<i>I have put together
an esteemed group of judges.</i>

18:30.394 --> 18:31.895
And they're gonna be judging
both of you

18:31.896 --> 18:33.630
on five stunning dishes.

18:33.631 --> 18:35.532
Five dishes, that's no joke.

18:35.533 --> 18:37.367
There's no turning back
right now... let's do it.

18:37.368 --> 18:39.102
I suggest you
get your jackets on,

18:39.103 --> 18:41.037
get yourselves to the kitchen,
and off you go.

18:41.038 --> 18:43.506
One hour...
it starts now!

18:43.507 --> 18:45.308
Off you go!
Yes, chef.

18:45.309 --> 18:48.111
I can feel the blood
rushing to my face.

18:48.112 --> 18:52.015
That nervousness is starting
to turn into competitiveness.

18:52.016 --> 18:54.851
And there's no way
I want to lose this challenge.

18:54.852 --> 18:56.419
Hi, chef.
Hey, chefs.

18:56.420 --> 18:58.221
For this final challenge,

18:58.222 --> 19:01.091
Christina and Justin must create
their unique take

19:01.092 --> 19:03.560
on five different types
of dishes

19:03.561 --> 19:05.662
that could appear on
the Gordon Ramsay Steak menu...

19:05.663 --> 19:08.131
a salad, a seafood appetizer,

19:08.132 --> 19:11.434
a rib eye, a filet,
and a fish entree.

19:11.435 --> 19:12.769
Okay, .

19:12.770 --> 19:14.704
This is the final challenge.

19:14.705 --> 19:16.606
I know Justin's gonna come
with everything he has.

19:16.607 --> 19:18.408
He wants this as badly as I do.

19:18.409 --> 19:21.511
I usually just use
the actual fat and toss it.

19:21.512 --> 19:23.113
I'm trm trying
to keep it simple.

19:23.114 --> 19:24.981
Sometimes you stick
with the dishes

19:24.982 --> 19:26.683
that are close to your heart,
and it's all you need.

19:26.684 --> 19:28.585
What do you need?
White wine.

19:28.586 --> 19:30.453
Christina's flavors are
definitely different from mine.

19:30.454 --> 19:32.088
She does simple dishes,
but that's not me, man.

19:32.089 --> 19:33.656
I don't do simple dishes.

19:33.657 --> 19:35.358
Say again.
I like going balls to the wall.

19:35.359 --> 19:37.827
Justin! Justin!

19:37.828 --> 19:41.531
Christina! Christina!
Christina!

19:41.532 --> 19:43.400
Okay, so you said
a little bit of mint

19:43.401 --> 19:45.268
<i>and a little bit
of cilantro in here?</i>

19:45.269 --> 19:46.870
Yes.
Mm, make sure you like that.

19:46.871 --> 19:48.338
Cilantro is cilantro.

19:48.339 --> 19:49.806
It's a strong flavor,

19:49.807 --> 19:51.941
and it can sometimes
be overwhelming.

19:51.942 --> 19:53.410
But I got to trust my gut here

19:53.411 --> 19:54.911
and just stand behind it.

19:54.912 --> 19:56.546
I'm gonna plate
this salad here, chef.

19:56.547 --> 19:58.047
I feel pretty
good about my salad...

19:58.048 --> 19:59.449
compressed watermelon,
charred tomato,

19:59.450 --> 20:01.284
feta cheese, tomato syrup.

20:01.285 --> 20:03.153
You know how many different
techniques there are

20:03.154 --> 20:03.953
just to make those four things?

20:03.954 --> 20:05.221
Dover in.

20:05.222 --> 20:07.524
Justin! Justin! Justin!

20:07.525 --> 20:08.825
Justin!

20:08.826 --> 20:11.127
Christina! Christina!

20:11.128 --> 20:12.962
Come on, baby!

20:12.963 --> 20:14.164
Christina, Justin,

20:14.165 --> 20:15.231
<i>15 minutes to go.</i>

20:15.232 --> 20:16.332
Yes, chef!

20:16.333 --> 20:18.935
Yes, chef.
Pushin' hard now.

20:18.936 --> 20:21.371
With my filet,
I want it to be rich.

20:21.372 --> 20:23.139
I really want that to just...

20:23.140 --> 20:24.974
Oh, kind of melt in your mouth.

20:24.975 --> 20:27.610
I think that my strongest dish
out of the five dishes

20:27.611 --> 20:28.978
is definitely the rib eye.

20:28.979 --> 20:30.613
That's gonna rest perfectly.

20:30.614 --> 20:32.482
Charred rib eye,
beer-battered onion rings,

20:32.483 --> 20:33.850
chorizo cream sauce,

20:33.851 --> 20:35.251
creamed nettles
mixed with spinach.

20:35.252 --> 20:37.687
Justin! Justin! Justin!

20:37.688 --> 20:40.223
Christina! Christina!

20:40.224 --> 20:41.791
Last minute, guys.
Yes, chef.

20:41.792 --> 20:43.092
Behind, behind.

20:43.093 --> 20:44.994
Justin is a maniac
in the kitchen...

20:44.995 --> 20:46.963
Behind you. Running around
like a headless chicken.

20:46.964 --> 20:47.964
me.

20:47.965 --> 20:49.265
I got to make it difficult.

20:49.266 --> 20:50.533
If I don't challenge myself,

20:50.534 --> 20:51.901
then I'm not doing myself
any justice.

20:51.902 --> 20:52.902
15 seconds.

20:56.207 --> 20:57.540
Five...

20:57.541 --> 20:58.575
Four...

20:58.576 --> 20:59.843
Three...

20:59.844 --> 21:00.844
Two...

21:00.845 --> 21:02.045
One...Stop.

21:02.046 --> 21:03.613
<i>You're good? Yeah.</i>

21:05.249 --> 21:07.183
With the cooking complete...

21:07.184 --> 21:09.319
Please welcome back
Christina and Justin!

21:10.921 --> 21:13.456
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

21:13.457 --> 21:15.692
It's now time
for Christina and Justin's

21:15.693 --> 21:18.695
steak house menus
to go head-to-head.

21:18.696 --> 21:21.898
The first dish is
the most amazing salad.

21:21.899 --> 21:23.933
To judge the salad round

21:23.934 --> 21:26.703
is a world-renowned chef.

21:26.704 --> 21:29.305
He's opened restaurants
in New York...

21:29.306 --> 21:30.874
Japan, Korea...

21:30.875 --> 21:32.775
And here in Las Vegas...

21:32.776 --> 21:35.044
Chef Francois Payard.

21:35.045 --> 21:36.713
Excellent.

21:40.451 --> 21:41.885
Wow. Really?

21:41.886 --> 21:44.254
Chef Payard, you're gonna
eat my food right now?

21:44.255 --> 21:46.756
That's comparable to being
a high-school basketball player

21:46.757 --> 21:49.292
that's really good
and meeting Michael Jordan.

21:49.293 --> 21:50.994
Chef, what I did
for you today was

21:50.995 --> 21:52.795
<i>heirloom tomatoes...
charred...</i>

21:52.796 --> 21:54.163
<i>feta cheese crumble,
compressed watermelon,</i>

21:54.164 --> 21:55.899
and a little bit
of banyuls vinaigrette.

21:55.900 --> 21:56.966
I have a lot of finesse
in my food.

21:56.967 --> 21:58.635
That's just my style.

21:58.636 --> 22:00.637
I think it's a very fresh salad,
very good for summer.

22:00.638 --> 22:02.438
Very nice.
Thank you, chef.

22:05.342 --> 22:08.978
Christina, explain your dish
to chef Francois, please.

22:08.979 --> 22:10.980
<i>Here we have grilled asparagus,</i>

22:10.981 --> 22:12.749
<i>fried-egg salad,
and, uh, baby arugula</i>

22:12.750 --> 22:14.350
<i>with fresh-shaved pecorino.</i>

22:14.351 --> 22:15.852
It's very nice, very simple.

22:15.853 --> 22:17.787
Little bit...
a lot of vinegar for me.

22:17.788 --> 22:19.322
Mm-hmm, a little bit
too much vinegar?

22:19.323 --> 22:20.790
Yeah.

22:20.791 --> 22:22.859
Chef Payard, is it the salad

22:22.860 --> 22:24.360
from Christina's or Justin's?

22:24.361 --> 22:25.428
Which one would you prefer?

22:25.429 --> 22:27.430
Um...

22:27.431 --> 22:29.098
I'm gonna go with Justin.

22:33.871 --> 22:35.371
Boom, beautiful.

22:35.372 --> 22:37.607
One up on Christina.
Hell, yeah.

22:37.608 --> 22:40.777
Next up, to judge
our seafood appetizer,

22:40.778 --> 22:42.545
<i>the chef/owner
of the new restaurant Central</i>

22:42.546 --> 22:45.214
here in Caesar's Palace,

22:45.215 --> 22:47.450
please welcome Michel Richard.
Excellent.

22:50.821 --> 22:53.189
Oh, my God.

22:53.190 --> 22:56.225
Michel Richard...
he is an idol of mine.

22:56.226 --> 22:57.794
And I'm definitely nervous

22:57.795 --> 22:59.862
when he steps up
to the judging table.

22:59.863 --> 23:02.398
Here I have
a coconut shrimp ceviche.

23:02.399 --> 23:04.400
<i>I steeped the coconut milk
with some ginger,</i>

23:04.401 --> 23:05.902
jalapeno, cilantro,
let it cool down and...

23:05.903 --> 23:08.004
Cilantro?
Oh, no.

23:08.005 --> 23:09.906
<i>I hate cilantro.
I'm sorry.</i>

23:09.907 --> 23:11.774
It's not too heavy.
I apologize, chef.

23:11.775 --> 23:13.242
Great.
Love my life right now.

23:13.243 --> 23:14.677
Oh, my gosh.

23:16.814 --> 23:18.581
That looks great.
Let me taste that.

23:21.051 --> 23:22.051
Well-seasoned...

23:22.052 --> 23:23.252
you're a great chef.

23:23.253 --> 23:25.488
Excellent.
Good start.

23:25.489 --> 23:27.423
Thank God.
I'm still in it.

23:27.424 --> 23:30.627
Justin, please be so kind
to explain your dish to chef.

23:30.628 --> 23:32.195
So, chef, what I prepared
for you is, uh,

23:32.196 --> 23:33.696
Ecuadorian-style ceviche,

23:33.697 --> 23:35.264
<i>where they poach
the shrimp first</i>

23:35.265 --> 23:37.000
<i>and they use that liquid
to make</i>

23:37.001 --> 23:38.501
the ceviche mixture,
which is ketchup,

23:38.502 --> 23:40.770
<i>orange juice, and the poaching
liquid from the shrimp.</i>

23:40.771 --> 23:42.605
And there's no cilantro
for you, chef.

23:44.174 --> 23:45.508
This is delicious.

23:45.509 --> 23:46.809
Thank you, chef.

23:46.810 --> 23:48.478
<i>So, chef, if you had to choose</i>

23:48.479 --> 23:50.413
between Christina's
seafood appetizer

23:50.414 --> 23:52.148
<i>or Justin's, who would it be?</i>

23:52.149 --> 23:54.917
Christina! Christina!

23:57.688 --> 24:00.790
Justin!

24:00.791 --> 24:02.492
Thank you very much.

24:02.493 --> 24:03.860
Chef, it's an honor.

24:03.861 --> 24:05.995
Oh...My God.

24:05.996 --> 24:07.463
It's okay.

24:07.464 --> 24:09.832
Justin's beating my ass
in front of an idol of mine.

24:09.833 --> 24:11.934
Ladies and gentlemen...
Thank you, chef.

24:11.935 --> 24:13.036
2-0, man... I might
just make a run for it.

24:13.037 --> 24:14.237
I win one more, it's over.

24:14.238 --> 24:17.140
<i>Justin gets
this right, it's over.</i>

24:23.347 --> 24:26.215
It's the final
challenge on the main stage

24:26.216 --> 24:27.516
at Paris Las Vegas,

24:27.517 --> 24:30.486
and Justin
leads Christina 2-0.

24:30.487 --> 24:31.687
Okay, to judge

24:31.688 --> 24:33.022
<i>the fish entree...</i>

24:33.023 --> 24:34.757
This man is the executive chef

24:34.758 --> 24:37.026
of two Michelin star
restaurant Picasso.

24:37.027 --> 24:38.661
Julian Serrano.

24:38.662 --> 24:40.162
Excellent.

24:41.698 --> 24:43.432
In order to stay in the game,

24:43.433 --> 24:45.801
Christina must score
with her halibut entree.

24:45.802 --> 24:47.503
Christina, why don't you
explain your dish, please,

24:47.504 --> 24:48.938
to chef?
Thank you.

24:48.939 --> 24:51.440
<i>Chef, today I have
a pan-seared halibut.</i>

24:51.441 --> 24:53.976
It's got purple Peruvian
potato puree

24:53.977 --> 24:55.444
and some grilled spinach.

25:02.586 --> 25:04.153
Wow. Okay, great.

25:04.154 --> 25:06.222
Good. Now, Justin,
if you can, please,

25:06.223 --> 25:07.890
to explain your dish.

25:07.891 --> 25:09.859
Duck fat fingerling potatoes.
Dover sole meuniere,

25:09.860 --> 25:13.329
and, uh, wild asparagus
with a little olive oil

25:13.330 --> 25:14.530
<i>and lemon juice on top.</i>

25:22.339 --> 25:23.439
Damn.

25:26.977 --> 25:28.577
Like, come on, Christina,

25:28.578 --> 25:29.679
here's your chance.

25:29.680 --> 25:30.980
You need to get a point.

25:30.981 --> 25:33.115
Just a get a point
on the board.

25:33.116 --> 25:36.118
Chef, is it the fish entree
from Christina,

25:36.119 --> 25:37.887
or it's Justin?

25:39.656 --> 25:41.324
I have to go with Christina.

25:44.528 --> 25:46.195
Yeah, baby!

25:46.196 --> 25:47.263
Yeah!

25:47.264 --> 25:49.365
This is kind of
that first swing

25:49.366 --> 25:51.133
in my fight back here
in this challenge.

25:51.134 --> 25:52.535
Okay, so it's 2-1.

25:52.536 --> 25:54.270
Two to Justin
and one to Christina.

25:54.271 --> 25:56.272
Next...

25:56.273 --> 25:59.041
To judge the rib eye round,
ladies and gentlemen...

25:59.042 --> 26:01.110
This man
is my right-hand man,

26:01.111 --> 26:03.612
and he'll be overseeing
the opening

26:03.613 --> 26:06.682
of Gordon Ramsay Steak
here in Vegas.

26:08.352 --> 26:11.087
Please welcome
chef Stuart Gillies.

26:14.057 --> 26:16.425
If Justin can
win the rib eye round,

26:16.426 --> 26:18.427
he will clinch the challenge.

26:18.428 --> 26:20.396
But first up, chef Gillies

26:20.397 --> 26:22.832
samples Christina's
port wine rib eye.

26:25.469 --> 26:27.336
Nice...
And visually good.

26:27.337 --> 26:29.171
I mean, if you want steak
and you go to a steak house,

26:29.172 --> 26:30.840
<i>that's what you want to see.
Mm-hmm.</i>

26:30.841 --> 26:33.075
<i>You want to see
something like that.</i>

26:33.076 --> 26:35.211
Christina's dish is just
steak on a plate.

26:35.212 --> 26:36.846
I just think
it's so old school.

26:36.847 --> 26:38.714
I'm completely
not about that at all.

26:38.715 --> 26:41.350
Chef Stuart we have a charred
piedmontese rib eye

26:41.351 --> 26:42.852
with an anson mills grits

26:42.853 --> 26:44.387
and beer-battered
onion rings, chef.

26:44.388 --> 26:45.921
That's the food that I put out.

26:45.922 --> 26:47.656
That's me on a plate right now.

26:47.657 --> 26:48.891
I don't know how the
she could beat me.

26:48.892 --> 26:50.359
The cooking's good.

26:50.360 --> 26:51.660
Charred it well.

26:51.661 --> 26:53.329
And the combination
of nettles, chorizo

26:53.330 --> 26:54.730
with the steak
and onion rings...

26:54.731 --> 26:55.831
It's good... well done.

26:55.832 --> 26:58.100
<i>Excellent.</i>

26:58.101 --> 26:59.602
Two very accomplished dishes.
Mm.

26:59.603 --> 27:02.338
<i>Christina or Justin?</i>

27:02.339 --> 27:04.106
Whoo!

27:07.477 --> 27:09.211
<i>Justin!
You know...</i>

27:09.212 --> 27:10.780
You have to remember,

27:10.781 --> 27:13.282
it's about a steak,
and it's about a steak house.

27:13.283 --> 27:14.683
It's got to be Christina.

27:21.558 --> 27:23.993
We have a tie at 2-2.

27:23.994 --> 27:25.428
Unbelievable.

27:25.429 --> 27:26.629
I went from 2-0 to 2-2.

27:26.630 --> 27:28.130
But I'm not nervous at all.

27:28.131 --> 27:29.365
I really feel confident
in my last dish.

27:29.366 --> 27:30.833
This is gonna be good.

27:30.834 --> 27:32.301
It all comes down
to this final dish...

27:32.302 --> 27:33.569
<i>Go, Christina!</i>

27:33.570 --> 27:34.970
The filet.

27:34.971 --> 27:36.605
And our final judge...

27:36.606 --> 27:37.973
<i>A living legend.</i>

27:37.974 --> 27:40.176
He has six restaurants here.

27:40.177 --> 27:41.343
That's just in Las Vegas.

27:42.813 --> 27:43.913
It's a great honor,
ladies and gentlemen,

27:43.914 --> 27:44.980
to welcome...

27:44.981 --> 27:46.916
Chef Wolfgang Puck.

27:46.917 --> 27:48.284
Yes.

27:50.020 --> 27:52.188
Welcome. Good to see you.
Thank you.

27:52.189 --> 27:54.023
I couldn't believe my eyes.
I couldn't believe my ears.

27:54.024 --> 27:55.191
Here comes Wolfgang Puck.

27:55.192 --> 27:56.992
You ask anybody in the world

27:56.993 --> 27:58.828
who Wolfgang Puck is,
they know.

27:58.829 --> 28:01.063
Chef, what you have
is a charred filet mignon,

28:01.064 --> 28:03.866
a butter-poached lobster,
and a glazed carrot.

28:05.302 --> 28:06.836
Good job.
I like it.

28:06.837 --> 28:08.604
<i>Yes?
Yep.</i>

28:08.605 --> 28:10.906
<i>Great stuff.
I'm glad you're happy.</i>

28:10.907 --> 28:13.442
Oh, man, I need
chef Puck to love my dish.

28:13.443 --> 28:15.377
Not even like it...
I need him to love it.

28:15.378 --> 28:17.513
<i>What I have here
is a pan-roasted filet.</i>

28:17.514 --> 28:20.015
Hercovair and gorgonzola
mashed potatoes.

28:21.485 --> 28:22.751
Mmm.

28:22.752 --> 28:24.053
Not bad.

28:24.054 --> 28:25.788
Mmm!

28:27.691 --> 28:30.126
I think both of you did
a fantastic job...

28:30.127 --> 28:32.228
<i>two excellent dishes.</i>

28:32.229 --> 28:34.997
I know you like them both,
and I know how hard this is,

28:34.998 --> 28:38.134
but we're tied at 2-2..

28:38.135 --> 28:39.935
Look at that plate... which one
do you want in a restaurant?

28:39.936 --> 28:40.736
Come on, give it to me.

28:40.737 --> 28:42.037
You have to choose one.

28:42.038 --> 28:44.573
Please, chef!
Please!

28:47.444 --> 28:49.245
Well...

28:52.916 --> 28:54.416
<i>Then I will have to go with...</i>

29:02.617 --> 29:04.452
With the
score tied at two apiece

29:04.453 --> 29:06.053
in the steak house challenge,

29:06.054 --> 29:08.255
it all comes down
to the final judge,

29:08.256 --> 29:09.690
Wolfgang Puck.

29:09.691 --> 29:12.259
I think both of you
did a fantastic job.

29:12.260 --> 29:15.763
But chef Puck is
having difficulty deciding

29:15.764 --> 29:19.033
between Justin's charred filet
with butter-poached lobster

29:19.034 --> 29:20.534
and Christina's
pan-roasted filet

29:20.535 --> 29:22.236
with veal bone marrow.

29:22.237 --> 29:24.338
I know you like them both,
and I know how hard this is.

29:24.339 --> 29:27.041
But we're tied at 2-2.
You have to choose one.

29:27.042 --> 29:29.443
Well, for
the presentation alone,

29:29.444 --> 29:31.846
I would probably go
with Justin.

29:31.847 --> 29:34.014
<i>But the taste...
I would go for Christina.</i>

29:34.015 --> 29:35.349
Wow.

29:35.350 --> 29:36.517
<i>So...</i>

29:36.518 --> 29:37.885
You have to choose one.

29:39.788 --> 29:40.921
<i>Well...</i>

29:40.922 --> 29:43.124
Then I will have to go
for the taste.

29:43.125 --> 29:44.358
It's Christina.

29:47.462 --> 29:49.530
Thank you, chef.

29:49.531 --> 29:50.965
Ha ha ha.

29:50.966 --> 29:52.566
I'm really, really great.

29:52.567 --> 29:55.169
Christina! Christina!

29:55.170 --> 29:56.971
But, uh, it's not over yet...

29:56.972 --> 29:58.939
biggest battle of my life
coming up.

29:58.940 --> 30:02.176
I need to wake up tomorrow
and go back to business

30:02.177 --> 30:04.378
and literally have
the service of my life.

30:04.379 --> 30:07.014
You know we have a lot of work
to do back in Hell's Kitchen.

30:07.015 --> 30:08.716
Ladies and gentlemen,
give them a big send-off

30:08.717 --> 30:10.084
and wish them all the best.

30:10.085 --> 30:11.685
Congratulations,
Christina and Justin.

30:11.686 --> 30:13.320
This is like preseason
right now.

30:13.321 --> 30:14.922
Tomorrow's where
it really happens.

30:14.923 --> 30:16.624
Christina should
definitely watch out.

30:16.625 --> 30:18.259
<i>I'm going to win Hell's Kitchen.
I have what it takes.</i>

30:18.260 --> 30:19.393
I've never been so determined
in my life.

30:19.394 --> 30:20.461
Thank you, guys.
Thank you.

30:23.465 --> 30:25.800
With the final
challenge complete...

30:25.801 --> 30:28.002
Hey.
Ah, the finalists.

30:28.003 --> 30:30.070
Christina and Justin are eager

30:30.071 --> 30:32.239
to head back
to Hell's Kitchen, but...

30:32.240 --> 30:35.009
There's one more thing we need
to do before we get back to L.A.

30:36.077 --> 30:37.578
Please, please, chef.

30:37.579 --> 30:40.714
Please don't let it be
anything too crazy.

30:40.715 --> 30:44.553
It's time to choose
your brigade!

30:46.121 --> 30:48.222
<i>And here they are!</i>

30:48.223 --> 30:50.057
Dana! Welcome back.

30:50.058 --> 30:52.326
We're getting ready
to pick our brigade.

30:52.327 --> 30:54.261
And this is definitely
the hardest decision

30:54.262 --> 30:56.230
I've had to make so far.

30:56.231 --> 30:59.233
My team could really sink me
if they're not on point.

30:59.234 --> 31:00.701
And they could, you know,

31:00.702 --> 31:02.503
help push me to victory
if they are.

31:02.504 --> 31:04.071
<i>Robyn, welcome back!</i>

31:04.072 --> 31:05.773
Yay, Robyn!
What up, Robyn?

31:05.774 --> 31:07.908
I'm literally trying
to get myself in the zone

31:07.909 --> 31:10.077
to make the biggest decision
of my life.

31:10.078 --> 31:12.279
Rahr!

31:12.280 --> 31:14.181
You don't want to pick
someone who's tired

31:14.182 --> 31:15.850
or mad or just doesn't even
want to do it.

31:15.851 --> 31:17.418
And I'm looking
at every single one of them,

31:17.419 --> 31:18.519
just thinking to myself,

31:18.520 --> 31:20.054
"who is really gonna help me

31:20.055 --> 31:21.622
to have a successful
service tomorrow?"

31:21.623 --> 31:23.057
<i>What's up, pat?
Patrick!</i>

31:23.058 --> 31:26.427
Look at that shirt. Wow!
You look rested.

31:26.428 --> 31:27.928
First of all, all of you,
welcome back.

31:27.929 --> 31:29.029
Good to see you.

31:29.030 --> 31:30.531
Thank you, chef.

31:30.532 --> 31:32.099
Happy to be back?
Yes, chef!

31:32.100 --> 31:35.069
As you know, you're back
for one major service.

31:35.070 --> 31:36.337
<i>Only this time,</i>

31:36.338 --> 31:37.972
it's not me relying on you.

31:37.973 --> 31:40.074
It's Christina and Justin.

31:40.075 --> 31:42.176
Their future lies in your hands.

31:42.177 --> 31:44.144
When I saw Justin and
Christina in the final round,

31:44.145 --> 31:45.646
it did not surprise me at all.

31:45.647 --> 31:48.082
But I'm not gonna ...
"Whoo!"

31:48.083 --> 31:49.917
I'm not gonna jump
up and down, no.

31:49.918 --> 31:51.619
Christina, Justin...
Yes, chef.

31:51.620 --> 31:54.154
<i>With so much riding on this,</i>

31:54.155 --> 31:56.190
choose wisely.

31:56.191 --> 31:59.193
Christina, you won
the final challenge.

31:59.194 --> 32:00.761
You have...

32:00.762 --> 32:02.663
<i>The most amazing advantage.</i>

32:02.664 --> 32:04.899
You get to pick first.

32:04.900 --> 32:07.534
Having first pick
is definitely crucial to me,

32:07.535 --> 32:10.204
because it also means
that I don't have last pick.

32:10.205 --> 32:12.606
I won't be stuck
with whoever's left.

32:12.607 --> 32:14.008
I'm picking this person

32:14.009 --> 32:16.043
because I'm gonna go
balls to the wall

32:16.044 --> 32:18.545
<i>and, uh, put scallops
on my menu.</i>

32:18.546 --> 32:19.613
I'm taking Dana.

32:19.614 --> 32:20.648
<i>Dana, wow.</i>

32:20.649 --> 32:22.316
Love it!
Nice.

32:22.317 --> 32:24.084
Great choice.

32:24.085 --> 32:26.320
Christina picks
me first, obviously.

32:26.321 --> 32:28.489
We're only, like, best friends.

32:28.490 --> 32:30.190
<i>I just feel like now,</i>

32:30.191 --> 32:31.458
like, I have you,

32:31.459 --> 32:33.394
and, like, I have nobody else.

32:33.395 --> 32:35.629
I'm right here, girl.
I'm not going anywhere.

32:35.630 --> 32:37.932
She's awesome,
and I'm awesome.

32:37.933 --> 32:39.934
So, not surprising.
Thank you, Christina.

32:39.935 --> 32:41.068
Justin.

32:41.069 --> 32:43.704
I got to have my meats
and my lambs

32:43.705 --> 32:45.506
<i>together tomorrow, 100%.</i>

32:45.507 --> 32:46.774
I got to ride on the person
that's been rockin' out meat

32:46.775 --> 32:47.908
like crazy.

32:47.909 --> 32:49.209
I got to go with Barbie, chef.

32:49.210 --> 32:50.744
<i>Barbie, wow.</i>

32:50.745 --> 32:52.479
That's a very big surprise
to me.

32:52.480 --> 32:54.481
But I have no hard feelings
whatsoever.

32:54.482 --> 32:56.483
I'm just happy
to be here.

32:56.484 --> 32:58.686
Surprising pick, but, yeah.
That's where it's got to be.

32:58.687 --> 33:01.488
It's me!
I'm not surprised.

33:01.489 --> 33:03.190
I'm the best person
that's been on meats.

33:03.191 --> 33:04.692
Two pork, chef.

33:05.994 --> 33:08.095
The pork and the Wellington
were cooked perfectly!

33:08.096 --> 33:09.563
<i>Thank you, chef!
Keep it going.</i>

33:09.564 --> 33:10.898
Okay, right.
Christina.

33:10.899 --> 33:13.467
Um...

33:14.703 --> 33:16.804
Right off the bat,
Christina's going Dana.

33:16.805 --> 33:18.372
Justin's going Barbie.

33:18.373 --> 33:20.374
And I get it, but I know
I'm the best chef left.

33:20.375 --> 33:21.408
Like, come on.

33:21.409 --> 33:23.143
I'm gonna take Patrick.

33:23.144 --> 33:24.912
<i>Thank you, Christina.
Patrick, wow.</i>

33:24.913 --> 33:26.814
Patrick...
like, you never worked with him.

33:26.815 --> 33:30.184
I want to know
the thought process behind that.

33:30.185 --> 33:31.952
Congratulations.
Thank you, buddy.

33:31.953 --> 33:34.288
I chose Patrick
because I think that he's

33:34.289 --> 33:35.689
a natural born leader.

33:35.690 --> 33:36.824
Chef, we're gonna
redeem ourselves.

33:36.825 --> 33:37.858
You're gonna what?

33:37.859 --> 33:39.460
Redeem ourselves, chef.

33:39.461 --> 33:41.695
So we got the 20 tarts up.
Risotto's going up.

33:41.696 --> 33:43.530
See the salad now?

33:43.531 --> 33:45.766
Uh, Justin.

33:46.835 --> 33:48.202
<i>I need someone</i>

33:48.203 --> 33:51.138
that could definitely
help me 100%.

33:51.139 --> 33:53.007
And for that reason,
I'm going with Brian.

33:53.008 --> 33:55.776
Wow. Good choice.
Thanks.

33:55.777 --> 33:59.013
I came in wanting to be
on Justin's team.

33:59.014 --> 34:01.281
Scallops and then
a little lobster.

34:01.282 --> 34:03.217
<i>And I pipe it
into the squash blossom.</i>

34:03.218 --> 34:04.718
I do like it.

34:04.719 --> 34:06.253
Me and Justin are completely
on the same page.

34:06.254 --> 34:07.321
We get each other.

34:07.322 --> 34:09.356
Great job today, buddy.

34:09.357 --> 34:11.358
I'm ready to battle.

34:14.496 --> 34:17.898
Okay, Christina,
look at the field.

34:17.899 --> 34:19.666
Look at what Justin's got.

34:22.437 --> 34:24.004
It's gonna be
a heavy meat night,

34:24.005 --> 34:26.206
and I got to go with Memphis.

34:26.206 --> 34:27.708
<i>Memphis girl, bring it on.</i>

34:27.708 --> 34:29.243
I kind of thought, you know,

34:29.244 --> 34:30.710
I would definitely be picked
over Kimmie.

34:30.712 --> 34:32.446
But I've been the outcast
since day one.

34:32.447 --> 34:33.847
But I'm not gonna change
who I am.

34:33.848 --> 34:35.014
Nice, nice!

34:35.016 --> 34:36.583
I chose Kimmie on meats

34:36.583 --> 34:38.452
because I know that
that's something she has

34:38.453 --> 34:40.521
probably
the most experience with.

34:40.522 --> 34:43.090
Are the rib eye coming?
Behind you, chef.

34:43.091 --> 34:44.992
<i>Kimmie!
That's beautifully cooked.</i>

34:44.993 --> 34:46.460
Awesome.

34:46.460 --> 34:47.828
<i>Okay, Justin...</i>

34:47.829 --> 34:49.730
Three left.

34:49.731 --> 34:51.331
Ten seconds, please, chef.

34:56.371 --> 34:58.005
I'm sorry, chef.
It's a really hard decision.

34:58.006 --> 34:59.640
<i>I-I know it's hard.</i>

34:59.641 --> 35:01.475
This is critical.

35:01.476 --> 35:03.544
Dude, come on.
I'm the best chef left.

35:03.545 --> 35:05.679
It's an easy choice.

35:05.680 --> 35:07.314
This is really tough.

35:08.650 --> 35:10.350
<i>You know, I love Clemenza,</i>

35:10.351 --> 35:12.019
but I see that look
in Royce's eyes right now,

35:12.020 --> 35:14.388
<i>and I got to go with Royce.
Royce. Wow.</i>

35:14.389 --> 35:16.723
You're winning this bitch.
Wow, wow, wow.

35:16.724 --> 35:18.258
I don't know what the
thought process is anymore.

35:18.259 --> 35:19.293
And at this point,
I'm completely lost.

35:19.294 --> 35:20.961
You're winning.

35:20.962 --> 35:22.830
I feel Royce had a
little bit of a tough time

35:22.831 --> 35:23.931
<i>here at Hell's Kitchen,
you know?</i>

35:23.932 --> 35:26.233
Royce, one of the toughest.

35:26.234 --> 35:27.701
Raw and perfect.

35:27.702 --> 35:28.936
<i>Rolls Royce,</i>

35:28.937 --> 35:30.504
off.

35:30.505 --> 35:32.506
So I think that he
has something to prove.

35:32.507 --> 35:33.974
You know, he's got that shine.
He's not smiling.

35:33.975 --> 35:35.609
He's not giggling.
He's serious.

35:35.610 --> 35:37.644
<i>Christina,
here's the good news.</i>

35:37.645 --> 35:39.179
You had the first.
You get the last pick.

35:39.180 --> 35:41.348
But you're now choosing
for both teams.

35:42.650 --> 35:44.351
I got a tough decision

35:44.352 --> 35:45.886
with Robyn and Clemenza.

35:45.887 --> 35:48.322
With Robyn,
the drama's been there

35:48.323 --> 35:49.723
basically from day one.

35:49.724 --> 35:51.358
You called me
a bitch today!

35:51.359 --> 35:52.659
And you want me to keep
my mouth shut?

35:52.660 --> 35:54.461
Hit me, hit me.

35:54.462 --> 35:56.330
Because I ain't
a child like you!

35:56.331 --> 35:58.999
But just watching Clemenza
kind of mosey around...

35:59.000 --> 36:00.534
cooking quickly and efficiently

36:00.535 --> 36:02.069
might not be his strong point.

36:05.440 --> 36:07.207
He's got to go faster now.

36:07.208 --> 36:08.609
Let's go, Clemenza, come on!

36:08.610 --> 36:10.077
Yes, chef!

36:10.078 --> 36:11.778
<i>Think.
Have a look down the line.</i>

36:11.779 --> 36:13.313
And look what you've got.

36:13.314 --> 36:16.383
Maybe why you're choosing
him or her for Justin.

36:16.384 --> 36:18.519
<i>Um...
Let's go!</i>

36:18.520 --> 36:20.454
The last pick really
makes me nervous,

36:20.455 --> 36:21.555
because that could drive
Robyn onto my team,

36:21.556 --> 36:23.390
and that's not gonna work.

36:23.391 --> 36:24.992
I don't need that kind of
disruption on my team at all.

36:24.993 --> 36:26.493
Um...

36:26.494 --> 36:28.462
Hurry up.
Make your decision.

36:35.873 --> 36:38.208
Justin and Christina's teams

36:38.209 --> 36:39.676
are almost complete.

36:39.677 --> 36:42.412
But there is one
critical pick left.

36:42.413 --> 36:43.980
Um...

36:43.981 --> 36:46.516
I'm hoping that
Christina's gonna pick Robyn.

36:46.517 --> 36:49.552
I really don't want her.
I really don't want her.

36:49.553 --> 36:52.055
At this point, I'm left
with Robyn and Clemenza.

36:52.056 --> 36:54.624
With Robyn, the drama's been
there from day one.

36:54.625 --> 36:56.326
And Clemenza is sloppy.

36:56.327 --> 36:58.261
I'm... I'm at a loss
right now.

36:58.262 --> 37:00.630
Um...

37:00.631 --> 37:02.799
I'm bringing Robyn back
with, uh, Kimmie.

37:02.800 --> 37:04.367
<i>Wow.</i>

37:04.368 --> 37:06.302
Gonna see what's out there.
Wow, wow, wow.

37:06.303 --> 37:08.238
Come on, for real?
Like, really?

37:08.239 --> 37:10.740
The last one? How am I supposed
to be a team player.

37:10.741 --> 37:12.342
You know, I know
I'm a good chef.

37:12.343 --> 37:14.244
You don't like me,
you.

37:14.245 --> 37:16.312
I don't think it's a good idea
that we waste

37:16.313 --> 37:18.681
one more second in Vegas

37:18.682 --> 37:20.517
'cause we got
some serious work to do.

37:20.518 --> 37:22.419
<i>Yes, chef.
Let's get back.</i>

37:22.420 --> 37:24.287
Jump on. All on the plane...
let's go.

37:24.288 --> 37:25.688
Well done, Christina.
Well done, Justin.

37:25.689 --> 37:26.823
With the brigades picked...

37:26.824 --> 37:28.793
Clemenza, I didn't expect you
to be last.

37:28.794 --> 37:29.909
And some feelings bruised...

37:31.497 --> 37:33.398
The finalists and their teams

37:33.399 --> 37:35.033
<i>head back to Hell's Kitchen.</i>

37:35.034 --> 37:36.634
<i>We're back!</i>

37:36.635 --> 37:39.370
And get straight to work.
Oh, yeah.

37:39.371 --> 37:41.306
<i>Remember all this, guys?
Come on, now.</i>

37:41.307 --> 37:42.340
Good luck, guys.

37:42.341 --> 37:43.675
Good luck.
Good luck.

37:43.676 --> 37:45.209
And by "good luck," I mean...

37:45.210 --> 37:46.578
"I hope you lose."

37:48.647 --> 37:50.448
Let's sit on the couch.

37:50.449 --> 37:52.350
<i>Sit on the couch?</i>

37:52.351 --> 37:55.286
I have a lot
to talk to my team about.

37:55.287 --> 37:56.821
They need to know I'm putting
a lot of faith

37:56.822 --> 37:58.189
in everybody right now.

37:58.190 --> 38:00.224
I mean, I'm putting my life
in their hands.

38:00.225 --> 38:01.793
I got a feeling inside of me
that they're gonna have my back,

38:01.794 --> 38:03.227
and they're gonna shine
tomorrow.

38:03.228 --> 38:05.663
I'm very happy
with my team right now.

38:05.664 --> 38:07.365
Let's do it.

38:07.366 --> 38:09.634
It's four apps,
four entrees, three desserts.

38:09.635 --> 38:11.636
<i>I have a grilled peach salad</i>

38:11.637 --> 38:14.072
<i>with, um, a whipped peppered
goat cheese.</i>

38:14.073 --> 38:15.673
<i>And then...</i>

38:15.674 --> 38:17.342
I wanted to challenge myself.

38:17.343 --> 38:18.576
We're gonna have scallop...

38:18.577 --> 38:20.111
scallop app...

38:20.112 --> 38:21.212
With?

38:21.213 --> 38:23.681
With risotto.

38:23.682 --> 38:25.083
Seriously, dude?

38:25.084 --> 38:27.518
We have enough trouble
with scallops alone

38:27.519 --> 38:28.753
and risotto alone!

38:28.754 --> 38:30.288
Now we have them all in one!

38:30.289 --> 38:32.857
A seared scallop
and risotto dish?

38:32.858 --> 38:34.959
<i>A little bit of risotto,
not a lot, like...</i>

38:34.960 --> 38:36.861
like, half of a portion
of what we usually make.

38:36.862 --> 38:40.765
This menu is going to be
a lot of work.

38:40.766 --> 38:43.501
<i>For entrees, okay, uh...</i>

38:43.502 --> 38:45.503
<i>Entree.
Bone-in veal chop.</i>

38:45.504 --> 38:47.305
<i>Nice.</i>

38:47.306 --> 38:49.807
I asked for, like,
a 14-ounce bone-in.

38:49.808 --> 38:51.476
Holy .

38:51.477 --> 38:53.811
Uh, Christina,
what are you thinking?

38:53.812 --> 38:56.114
That's enormous. Like, that's
a little scary,

38:56.115 --> 38:57.949
since I'm on meats.

38:57.950 --> 39:00.284
<i>First, I was like, "oh,
that's easy, that's easy."</i>

39:00.285 --> 39:02.120
And then I'm like,
"whoa, that's getting hard."

39:02.121 --> 39:03.955
It's a little intense

39:03.956 --> 39:05.857
knowing that my fate rests
on their ability

39:05.858 --> 39:07.558
to turn out this menu.

39:07.559 --> 39:10.762
But, you know, I trust...
I trust my team can turn it out.

39:10.763 --> 39:12.497
Dude, I'm thinking about Vegas.

39:12.498 --> 39:15.266
Like, what the
do you want from me?

39:17.636 --> 39:19.303
<i>So start off with a...</i>

39:19.304 --> 39:21.339
a piedmontese 12-ounce
bone-out rib eye.

39:21.340 --> 39:23.041
Say that one more time.

39:23.042 --> 39:24.609
Piedmont... well, just
12-ounce bone-out rib eye.

39:24.610 --> 39:26.044
<i>The first fish,</i>

39:26.045 --> 39:27.512
I went straight classic...

39:27.513 --> 39:28.780
<i>sauteed dover sole.</i>

39:28.781 --> 39:31.082
What's... what's... what?

39:31.083 --> 39:32.483
I'm going over the menu,

39:32.484 --> 39:34.085
and Clemenza's
just not listening.

39:34.086 --> 39:35.953
You know, this is it right now.

39:35.954 --> 39:37.722
This is the most important
service of my life.

39:37.723 --> 39:39.257
This is gonna be the most
important day of my life.

39:39.258 --> 39:41.459
<i>So I originally chose
just a microgreen salad,</i>

39:41.460 --> 39:43.828
<i>but I'm thinking I want to add
a little frisee to that</i>

39:43.829 --> 39:45.229
<i>just to have it hold up
on top of the crab cake.</i>

39:45.230 --> 39:46.698
The little pieces.

39:46.699 --> 39:48.132
Well, and also, it gives it
height as well.

39:48.133 --> 39:49.667
<i>Exactly.
Yeah.</i>

39:49.668 --> 39:51.903
The next app...
Clemenza, pay attention to this.

39:51.904 --> 39:53.504
The next app is truffle
edamame ravioli.

39:53.505 --> 39:55.506
<i>So, essentially,</i>

39:55.507 --> 39:56.774
<i>it's a ravioli,</i>

39:56.775 --> 39:59.544
but it's done in wonton skins.

39:59.545 --> 40:01.779
They've got to know that menu
inside out.

40:01.780 --> 40:03.614
And I need Clemenza
to stay focused.

40:03.615 --> 40:05.283
I need him to keep
his head in the game.

40:05.284 --> 40:07.151
I need to know
that he has my back 100%.

40:07.152 --> 40:08.453
Listen, I just want to know,

40:08.454 --> 40:10.138
<i>and I want a real answer,</i>

40:10.139 --> 40:12.040
<i>who the is here,
really, to be here,</i>

40:12.041 --> 40:13.508
and who really wants to
get back in that kitchen

40:13.509 --> 40:15.176
and has something to prove?

40:15.177 --> 40:16.811
I'm going into it tomorrow
with more pressure

40:16.812 --> 40:18.246
than you could ever imagine.

40:18.247 --> 40:20.181
<i>And I want you to just
get your head</i>

40:20.182 --> 40:21.382
right where it needs to be.

40:21.383 --> 40:22.850
Like, what the ?

40:22.851 --> 40:24.919
<i>Who the do you
think you're talking to?</i>

40:24.920 --> 40:26.687
<i>I'm taking this
100% serious, man.</i>

40:26.688 --> 40:28.189
<i>This is the most
important day of my life.</i>

40:28.190 --> 40:30.291
I get it. Here's my thing...
I'm proud of what I did.

40:30.292 --> 40:32.060
I'm happy in my accomplishment.

40:32.061 --> 40:33.795
<i>I don't got anything
to prove to anybody.</i>

40:33.796 --> 40:34.962
Clemenza,
shut the up, please.

40:34.963 --> 40:36.697
Clemenza's a disaster
right now.

40:36.698 --> 40:38.132
He's got to pull
his together.

40:38.133 --> 40:39.400
I need him to step up
and get it done.

40:39.401 --> 40:41.169
I need you to be 100% focused.

40:41.170 --> 40:43.104
Drill me as hard
as you want.

40:43.105 --> 40:44.872
And it's all .
Doesn't matter to me.

40:44.873 --> 40:46.240
Clemenza's dead weight.

40:46.241 --> 40:48.976
Justin's got to cut the fat
where the fat needs to be cut.

40:48.977 --> 40:51.212
Like, honestly, to me,
it's my life right now.

40:51.213 --> 40:52.680
I need you to do it for me,

40:52.681 --> 40:54.282
but I want you
to do it for yourself.

40:54.283 --> 40:56.384
Dude, get off my back.
I don't care. I'm done.

40:56.385 --> 40:57.919
You want to be the leader?
You're gonna be in command?

40:57.920 --> 40:59.954
You know what?
You're gonna sink quick.

40:59.955 --> 41:01.556
Stand back, 'cause I'll
roll over you like no tomorrow.

41:01.557 --> 41:04.025
If you don't feel
what I feel right now,

41:04.026 --> 41:05.993
<i>that you want to win,
then you got a problem.</i>

41:05.994 --> 41:08.129
You should just go
