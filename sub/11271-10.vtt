00:04.212 --> 00:07.545
HOW DO I LOVE THEE,
LET ME CALL YOU BACK

00:07.712 --> 00:09.755
A gift.

00:10.421 --> 00:13.547
- Who's it for?
- It's for Harry.

00:13.714 --> 00:16.966
Why are you giving a gift
to that conman?

00:17.132 --> 00:22.760
To pay him back for conning us. Coach
found a trick wallet in a novelty shop.

00:22.927 --> 00:28.720
What you do is you open it up
and flames come right up to your face.

00:28.887 --> 00:33.514
- Isn't this a little crueI?
- It's harmless, really.

00:33.681 --> 00:36.556
That's why we didn't give it to you.

00:36.723 --> 00:39.349
He's coming. Here he comes.

00:43.267 --> 00:46.519
- Am I glad to see you, Harry.
- You are?

00:46.686 --> 00:51.145
Are you kidding me?
You are a valued customer and a friend.

00:51.312 --> 00:56.315
I was feeling bad about all the times
I kicked you out of here.

00:56.482 --> 00:59.400
- It's from all of us.
- For me?

00:59.565 --> 01:02.817
Gosh,
I never expected anything like this.

01:02.983 --> 01:08.653
No one's ever given me anything
voluntarily. Shall I save it for Christmas?

01:08.819 --> 01:12.529
No. Please, Harry. Open it now.
It's a hot one.

01:17.280 --> 01:20.365
- A wallet!
- It's just a little gesture.

01:20.532 --> 01:23.950
- It's beautifuI.
- I can't wait.

01:24.117 --> 01:27.368
I'm so touched.

01:27.535 --> 01:29.577
Don't mention it.

01:29.744 --> 01:33.079
- Aren't you going to open it?
- Sure.

01:33.246 --> 01:36.956
Back from your face a little,
so we can all see.

01:42.165 --> 01:46.792
- It was funnier in the store.
- There must be 60 bucks here.

01:46.959 --> 01:51.670
You guys are too much.
I'll never forget this. Thanks a lot.

01:54.920 --> 01:59.005
Did that wallet look familiar to anybody?

02:00.673 --> 02:03.465
- Give me the beer!
- Don't you dare.

02:05.000 --> 02:11.074

03:14.618 --> 03:19.244
Come on. My boyfriend has been
dying to see this Hagler fellow

03:19.411 --> 03:23.162
and how is a waitress like me
going to get $200?

03:23.329 --> 03:27.123
I don't care.
We can scout the tickets at the arena.

03:27.290 --> 03:30.790
OK. I'll pay. I'll pay the $200.

03:30.957 --> 03:35.585
Give me my purse.
It's still exorbitant for a prizefight.

03:35.751 --> 03:40.003
It's Marvin Hagler.
It's the prizefight of the year.

03:40.920 --> 03:43.337
I assume that a cheque will do.

03:44.213 --> 03:49.214
Anything. Make it out to PhiI Keppler,
MedicaI Corporation.

03:51.716 --> 03:56.134
I thought I recognised
that naturaI compassion, Doctor.

04:03.137 --> 04:09.556
He's a lucky man. By the way, I could
remove that little thing in 30 minutes.

04:20.517 --> 04:23.686
Surprise.

04:24.770 --> 04:29.813
Don't tell me. The exhibit
of Norwegian wood cuts is back in town.

04:31.647 --> 04:34.648
- Holy moly.
- What is it, Sam?

04:34.815 --> 04:37.316
- Look at this.
- Holy moly.

04:37.482 --> 04:41.818
- Surely it's not that big a thing.
- Are you kidding? Look.

04:41.985 --> 04:44.111
Holy moly.

04:44.277 --> 04:48.863
- How'd you do it?
- It wasn't easy.

04:49.029 --> 04:54.324
They belonged to two young men,
but after I finished waiting on them...

04:54.490 --> 04:56.699
...they were two old men.

04:59.575 --> 05:02.201
They succumbed to my charms.

05:02.368 --> 05:04.702
They were two blind men.

05:06.453 --> 05:12.080
Thank you so much. Later on, you can
redeem that for a reaI thank you.

05:12.246 --> 05:16.498
You know what I mean? Let's go.
We don't have much time.

05:16.665 --> 05:22.709
There's one proviso. You do not take me
with you, or tell me about it later.

05:22.876 --> 05:26.127
OK. I wonder who I should take.

05:34.005 --> 05:40.382
I gotta change. Figure it out amongst
yourselves. I'm going to the Hagler fight.

05:42.383 --> 05:44.467
I love you.

05:47.260 --> 05:50.636
- What are we going to do?
- I got a great idea.

05:50.803 --> 05:55.055
I think of a number from one to ten.
The closest gets to go.

05:55.221 --> 05:57.097
Fair enough.

05:58.140 --> 06:00.265
- Seven.
- Nine.

06:00.432 --> 06:03.641
- Two.
- I'll say three.

06:06.059 --> 06:10.019
Wait. You can't say anything.
You know what it is.

06:10.185 --> 06:12.520
- It's six.
- Why say three?

06:12.687 --> 06:15.855
Three's my lucky number.

06:16.021 --> 06:18.814
Coach, I want in on this, too.

06:26.776 --> 06:32.402
I don't know about this cologne you
bought me. Two showers and it's gone.

06:38.489 --> 06:42.907
Sam, I want you to know
that what you just said out there

06:43.072 --> 06:47.241
just now set my heart to pounding.

06:48.325 --> 06:53.578
I think I know myself, but
my preconceptions fly out the window

06:53.744 --> 06:57.454
when the man in my life says,
"I love you. "

06:57.621 --> 06:59.662
Who said that?

07:01.747 --> 07:05.789
- You did.
- Hey, honey, don't worry about that.

07:05.956 --> 07:08.583
That doesn't mean anything.

07:12.126 --> 07:16.836
- It doesn't?
- I've used that as a line on 100 girls.

07:20.046 --> 07:25.381
- You've never said it to me.
- I wouldn't waste a line on you.

07:26.340 --> 07:31.549
Now, what I mean by that is you're not
the kind of girI to use a line on.

07:31.716 --> 07:35.426
You're the kind of girI
that falls for sincerity.

07:35.593 --> 07:41.596
I don't mean that either. It's something
I say. I say it to Coach all the time.

07:41.763 --> 07:47.306
I say it to anybody who gets me tickets
to the Hagler fight. I just say it.

07:47.473 --> 07:50.307
Sam, get back in here.

07:52.517 --> 07:55.226
I think I know what you're saying.

07:55.392 --> 08:00.395
When I and everyone else
in the world say I love you,

08:00.561 --> 08:04.230
we are opening up
the very core of our being.

08:06.231 --> 08:08.273
When you say it,

08:08.440 --> 08:12.273
- you're just clearing your throat.
- Well put.

08:13.816 --> 08:18.068
I'm confused. You gave me
tickets to a fight I want to see

08:18.235 --> 08:22.487
and now you won't let me see it.
Is this some kind of test?

08:22.654 --> 08:27.821
- What does our relationship mean?
- It means a lot.

08:29.739 --> 08:32.740
- Go on.
- Thank you.

08:32.907 --> 08:35.323
Sam, stop!

08:35.491 --> 08:39.368
I have spent three months
writing in my journaI,

08:39.534 --> 08:42.953
filling pages with
thoughts concerning us.

08:43.119 --> 08:49.455
I have consumed entire weekends trying
to discover what our relationship means.

08:49.622 --> 08:53.289
And what do I get from you?
"It means a lot. "

08:53.456 --> 08:55.500
Can you see why I'm furious?

08:55.666 --> 08:59.626
Sure. You work at it for months
and I get it like that.

08:59.793 --> 09:04.087
- If you leave, we're through.
- I hate ultimatums.

09:04.252 --> 09:07.504
You give me an ultimatum
and we're through.

09:07.671 --> 09:09.797
- What?
- That's better.

09:12.172 --> 09:16.632
- Guess who got the extra ticket.
- Come on, Harry.

09:17.716 --> 09:20.968
Please, don't get us in trouble tonight.

09:21.134 --> 09:24.678
Come on. I'll be good. In fact, I'm driving.

09:24.843 --> 09:27.553
What kind of car do you want to take?

09:38.349 --> 09:43.101
<i>She aches just like a woman</i>

09:44.936 --> 09:49.395
<i>Queen Mary, she's my friend...</i>

09:52.646 --> 09:56.647
Come on, Diane. I know you're up.
Your candles are on.

09:59.274 --> 10:03.275
- What do you want?
- I want to come in, I think.

10:08.944 --> 10:11.152
Insy-daisy.

10:17.072 --> 10:21.074
- You're drunk.
- You're stupid.

10:25.867 --> 10:28.285
I'll be sober in the morning.

10:33.745 --> 10:37.913
- What are we drinking here?
- Vino.

10:38.956 --> 10:44.125
Listen, I know why you're doing this.
It's my fault and I'm sorry.

10:44.291 --> 10:46.333
Don't flatter yourself.

10:46.500 --> 10:51.128
My walking out in the middle
of an argument wasn't exactly...

10:51.294 --> 10:55.920
When I was a kid, I had
nightmares about places like this.

10:56.087 --> 10:58.255
Do you think you could...

10:59.547 --> 11:02.048
No bats!

11:04.757 --> 11:11.093
Listen. I came over here for a reason.
I brought you this. It's a present. Open it.

11:13.177 --> 11:16.679
- You bought it at this hour?
- What's time?

11:16.846 --> 11:21.097
When your lady's owed a present,
she gets a present.

11:28.559 --> 11:32.269
- What is it?
- It's a boxing-glove purse.

11:36.103 --> 11:38.645
How much did you pay for this?

11:38.812 --> 11:42.772
- Price is no object.
- Obviously.

11:44.105 --> 11:48.357
Big shot. Big athlete shot.

11:49.650 --> 11:53.025
You really are gone. I'll get some coffee.

11:53.192 --> 11:55.651
I am bombed.

11:55.818 --> 12:01.821
But I have been doing
some very clear thinking tonight...

12:01.988 --> 12:04.655
about us.

12:05.823 --> 12:12.492
I have decided that if it isn't
worth examining what we have,

12:12.659 --> 12:16.118
maybe we don't have anything.

12:16.285 --> 12:20.078
Come on.
You're not thinking about ending it?

12:22.412 --> 12:26.330
I'll have you know
that when I was in high schooI,

12:26.497 --> 12:30.915
I was voted the girI most likely
to marry into old money.

12:33.416 --> 12:37.710
- Drink this. It'll make you feeI better.
- Nothing will.

12:37.877 --> 12:41.962
- But this will make me feeI better.
- Wait a minute.

12:42.128 --> 12:48.380
Now, you're upset about my not thinking
about our relationship. Am I right?

12:50.632 --> 12:52.757
Yes, sir.

12:52.924 --> 12:58.801
I will think about our relationship.
Maybe we should take time off.

12:58.968 --> 13:04.345
Not see each other for a while.
That way, I'll have one thing on my mind.

13:04.512 --> 13:07.096
One more than you usually have.

13:07.263 --> 13:11.556
Not now.
Listen, how long should we take?

13:15.141 --> 13:18.392
I don't know. A week would be nice.

13:19.810 --> 13:26.437
All right. We'll split up for a week, get
back together and we'll compare thinks.

13:26.604 --> 13:28.562
Yes, sir. Fine.

13:31.273 --> 13:33.523
However, I must warn you,

13:33.690 --> 13:38.191
if you come up with nothing
and I come up with nothing...

13:38.358 --> 13:43.776
Come on. Don't worry about that.
I'll come up with something. I promise.

13:45.778 --> 13:49.487
Are you sure you're going to be all right?

13:51.238 --> 13:57.241
I'm not going to waste any time at all.
I'm going to start thinking right now.

14:04.910 --> 14:07.161
That's my girI.

14:18.081 --> 14:20.874
I thought I was a disgusting drunk.

14:28.819 --> 14:32.070
- What a night!
- It's not over yet.

14:32.237 --> 14:35.446
Step into Clifford's poker emporium.

14:35.612 --> 14:39.948
I can't remember
my last all-night poker game.

14:40.115 --> 14:46.159
These cards you bought at the strip joint,
the sexy ladies are wearing bikinis.

14:46.325 --> 14:50.452
That's right.
You've got to rub it off with a dime.

14:51.703 --> 14:54.120
Let me see, will you, Cliff?

14:56.288 --> 15:01.747
- I can't get the bikini off my girI.
- Story of your life.

15:04.915 --> 15:08.625
That's my first time
in the Combat Zone sober.

15:08.792 --> 15:13.419
It shows you can still
have a good time without drinking,

15:13.586 --> 15:19.713
as long as you're surrounded by naked
broads shaking their wallies in your face.

15:19.880 --> 15:23.214
- Words to live by.
- We did have a good time.

15:23.381 --> 15:27.258
Thanks to our leader,
who won the chugging contest,

15:27.425 --> 15:31.301
yelled at the strippers
and punched some bouncers.

15:31.468 --> 15:35.386
- Where is our leader?
- There she is right now.

15:39.637 --> 15:41.889
You left these in the car.

15:44.390 --> 15:49.017
- Why did the stripper throw 'em at you?
- I attract women.

15:49.183 --> 15:52.934
Like moths to a flame.
Like honey bees to a flower.

15:53.101 --> 15:55.394
Like flies to a road apple.

16:01.354 --> 16:05.064
Carla, how do you know
about the Combat Zone?

16:05.231 --> 16:10.066
My ex always used to take me there.
He loved the theatre.

16:11.774 --> 16:16.777
We were there for the premiere
of "College Girls Totally Nude".

16:16.943 --> 16:24.196
It's terrific. Nothing against Diane. It
feels so good to get out with the guys.

16:25.489 --> 16:29.198
You made a mistake telling Diane,
"I love you. "

16:29.365 --> 16:35.367
Say it to a girI, they make a big deaI out
of it. To a guy it doesn't mean anything.

16:35.534 --> 16:39.786
- Go ahead. Say it to me, for example.
- Norm, I love you.

16:40.703 --> 16:42.746
I was wrong.

16:45.455 --> 16:51.874
Time's running out. What are you going
to tell Diane about your thinking fest?

16:52.041 --> 16:56.667
I thought about it a million times
and I came up with nothing.

16:56.834 --> 17:01.628
I don't need a week. What was I known
for when I was playing ball?

17:01.794 --> 17:05.671
- Giving up home runs.
- Chasing anything in a skirt.

17:05.838 --> 17:11.089
- Drinking yourself senseless.
- Coming through in the clutch.

17:13.507 --> 17:17.760
No. I need the pressure.
Slugger at the plate.

17:17.925 --> 17:24.470
Bases loaded. Thousands of fans
chanting, "Mayday". You'll see.

17:24.637 --> 17:30.764
- Tomorrow will come and I'll be there.
- Tomorrow's today. It's past midnight.

17:30.930 --> 17:34.098
She won't come now.
No one's that crazy.

17:34.265 --> 17:36.391
Evening, everyone.

17:37.892 --> 17:42.393
- I'm back.
- Mayday.

17:47.687 --> 17:54.273
I couldn't wait to see you after a week
of deep and torturous souI searching.

17:54.440 --> 17:58.067
But I don't want to get in the way
of your fun times.

17:58.233 --> 18:02.610
You're right. It's a victory party.
You see, I got it.

18:02.777 --> 18:05.819
- You got what?
- Our relationship.

18:05.986 --> 18:11.738
Tonight, it came perfectly clear
and I decided to celebrate there.

18:11.905 --> 18:14.739
Sam, that's wonderfuI. Tell me.

18:14.906 --> 18:20.909
I can't wait to tell you, but I just need
a couple of minutes to polish it up.

18:21.076 --> 18:25.035
It's pretty good,
but I need to rearrange the words.

18:26.118 --> 18:28.827
- Two minutes.
- Of course.

18:30.953 --> 18:33.163
Stall.

18:38.415 --> 18:41.666
You go anywhere?

18:43.250 --> 18:47.877
Well, I spent some time at Cape Cod.
I love it in winter.

18:49.669 --> 18:55.088
I have a theory about how Cape Cod
was formed, geologically speaking.

18:56.047 --> 18:58.090
Excuse me.

18:59.672 --> 19:02.382
Well?

19:04.050 --> 19:06.092
Mayday!

19:07.384 --> 19:11.636
You surprised me.
I forgot what I was gonna say.

19:12.637 --> 19:18.097
Sorry. I'm excited. You have things
to tell me. I have things to tell you.

19:18.263 --> 19:20.556
Tons.

19:23.140 --> 19:25.558
So?

19:26.642 --> 19:31.144
One of the things I've discovered
is I'm a very shy person.

19:31.311 --> 19:35.562
- Do you mind going first?
- Of course not.

19:36.646 --> 19:39.272
- Great insight.
- Thank you.

19:41.773 --> 19:45.900
This is the way
I describe our relationship.

19:46.066 --> 19:48.317
It's more than like.

19:49.400 --> 19:52.026
Beyond fondness.

19:53.069 --> 19:56.779
Verging on deep affection.

19:58.362 --> 20:04.365
There's a vitaI physicaI component,
bordering on the passionate.

20:05.698 --> 20:09.950
However, it has not reached the leveI

20:10.116 --> 20:16.869
at which we will abandon reservations
about a complete commitment.

20:19.538 --> 20:21.579
That's how I see things.

20:33.793 --> 20:35.584
Ditto.

20:43.421 --> 20:45.881
Ditto?

20:46.048 --> 20:49.965
You're telling me
I waited a week for "ditto"?

20:50.131 --> 20:52.467
You took my answer.

20:54.759 --> 20:56.927
All right, I'm sorry.

20:57.927 --> 21:01.928
No more stalling.
I'll just tell you right here.

21:06.681 --> 21:12.975
I couldn't come up with anything.
I'm sorry. I really wanted to do this.

21:13.140 --> 21:19.561
I don't understand. I'm usually so good
under pressure, but I just drew a blank.

21:21.811 --> 21:27.064
Honey,
I have no idea why we're together.

21:32.899 --> 21:35.316
Neither do I.

21:37.317 --> 21:40.193
- You don't?
- I don't have a clue.

21:40.360 --> 21:44.612
- What about what you just said?
- I read it in a book.

21:45.987 --> 21:49.239
It sounded nice, but it's not us.

21:50.322 --> 21:54.031
- Is it?
- I don't know. I wasn't listening.

21:56.450 --> 22:01.451
Please, whatever we do right now,
don't say, "What are we doing?"

22:01.618 --> 22:05.411
What are we doing
that I can't say what are we doing?

22:05.577 --> 22:09.037
I was going to say
that it's totally hopeless,

22:09.204 --> 22:12.247
that I can't make sense
of our relationship.

22:12.414 --> 22:15.374
Why do we have to make sense of it?

22:15.540 --> 22:21.543
Think about it and it loses its sense. The
reason I'm with you is because I lo...

22:24.335 --> 22:27.128
What, Sam?

22:27.294 --> 22:31.005
I said the reason
why I'm with you is cos I lo...

22:32.171 --> 22:36.882
- You lo...?
- You know what I mean.

22:37.049 --> 22:41.550
- What's the matter? Can't you say it?
- Of course. I lo...

22:44.552 --> 22:50.095
Don't you see? That phrase
that you throw around so casually

22:50.262 --> 22:52.971
is now impossible for you to say.

22:53.138 --> 22:57.848
Why can't you say it?
Because with me, it's no longer casuaI.

22:58.932 --> 23:02.642
I'm important to you. I matter.

23:03.975 --> 23:08.686
This is silly. I can say Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers.

23:08.853 --> 23:11.395
A peck of pickled peppers
did Peter Piper pick.

23:11.562 --> 23:14.855
- OK. Now, say the other thing.
- I lo...

23:18.356 --> 23:22.566
Hey, everybody.
Sam can't say he loves me.

23:24.400 --> 23:26.192
Who can?

24:01.248 --> 24:02.248
English

24:03.305 --> 24:09.881
