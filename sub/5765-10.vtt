WEBVTT

00:01.800 --> 00:03.222
ALICIA:
Simple assault.

00:03.270 --> 00:04.589
MAN:
Six months' detention,

00:04.630 --> 00:05.767
three years' probation.

00:05.800 --> 00:07.768
Two years' probation,
no jail time.

00:07.800 --> 00:09.768
(chuckles):
You do know it's called
bargaining, right?

00:09.810 --> 00:11.766
Why am I the only one
making concessions?

00:11.810 --> 00:14.028
I just gave you
an extra year
on probation.

00:14.080 --> 00:15.775
You're not giving me
anything on detention.

00:15.810 --> 00:17.471
Because my client
doesn't deserve it--

00:17.510 --> 00:19.410
he's a 98-pound
wallflower.

00:19.450 --> 00:21.543
Who clocked a classmate
with an algebra textbook.

00:21.580 --> 00:23.138
Because he was
being bullied.

00:23.190 --> 00:26.455
19 stitches, a
cracked eye socket.

00:26.490 --> 00:29.653
So what's someone from
Stern, Lockhart domg In
juvenile court, anyway?

00:29.690 --> 00:30.725
God's work.

00:30.760 --> 00:34.423
One of our big clients;
it's his housekeeper's son.

00:34.460 --> 00:37.759
Let him plead no contest;
three years probation.

00:37.800 --> 00:39.165
(scoffs):
Come on.

00:39.200 --> 00:41.634
I make that deal,
I'm looking for a job.

00:41.670 --> 00:43.763
No. You have
the flexibility
to go to zero,

00:43.810 --> 00:45.368
or you would have
made a call.

00:45.410 --> 00:48.732
So your husband
told you all our secrets?

00:48.780 --> 00:50.577
Some.

00:50.610 --> 00:53.317
Look, my client is
a straight-A student.

00:53.350 --> 00:56.319
Never had a bad day before,
never have a bad day again,

00:56.350 --> 00:58.147
unless you
incarcerate him.

00:59.420 --> 01:02.787
One year probation,
200 hours community service,

01:02.830 --> 01:05.458
and he takes responsibility
in open court.

01:05.490 --> 01:07.822
N0 "bully did this,
I did that."

01:07.860 --> 01:10.192
Thank you.

01:10.230 --> 01:12.198
Go and sin no more.

01:15.900 --> 01:17.231
We've been watching you.

01:18.240 --> 01:19.207
(chuckles)

01:19.240 --> 01:20.798
Now, that sounds sinister.

01:20.840 --> 01:23.604
I know how you
hate praise, Diane,

01:23.650 --> 01:26.210
so please, forgive us.

01:26.250 --> 01:27.842
What you have done for women,

01:27.880 --> 01:31.509
through example,
encouragement and
perseverance,

01:31.550 --> 01:33.814
is truly unparalleled.

01:33.860 --> 01:35.418
Your work on
EMILY's List,

01:35.460 --> 01:37.223
your mentoring of young lavwers,

01:37.260 --> 01:39.194
your shattering
of the glass ceiling...

01:39.230 --> 01:40.697
I have a feeling
we're coming

01:40.730 --> 01:42.425
to a very
significant "but."

01:42.470 --> 01:43.698
MAN:
No, a small one.

01:48.640 --> 01:50.767
we want you to be a judge.

01:52.640 --> 01:54.198
No!

01:54.240 --> 01:55.207
Yes.

01:55.240 --> 01:57.401
MAN; We're here
as representatives

01:57.450 --> 01:59.441
of the Democratic ward
and committee chairs,

01:59.480 --> 02:02.688
and we would like to slate you
for the upcoming election.

02:02.720 --> 02:05.188
I-I...

02:05.220 --> 02:06.551
I'm startled.

02:06.590 --> 02:08.649
WOMAN:
We need more women
judges, DIane.

02:08.690 --> 02:10.578
We need better judges.

02:10.630 --> 02:13.394
Right now we have two lifeguards
for every swimmer--

02:13.430 --> 02:16.228
two judges who
understand the law

02:16.270 --> 02:17.567
for everyone who doesn't--

02:17.600 --> 02:19.932
and we need to
maintain that ratio.

02:19.970 --> 02:22.234
Well, I hope I'm a lifeguard.

02:22.270 --> 02:23.828
That's the reason we're here.

02:27.240 --> 02:28.832
And my firm?

02:28.880 --> 02:30.541
You'll have to divest,

02:30.580 --> 02:31.808
of course.

02:31.850 --> 02:33.545
We don't do the smoke-filled
rooms anymore, Diane,

02:33.580 --> 02:35.719
but we do manage
the primary ballot.

02:35.750 --> 02:37.217
So if you agree,

02:37.250 --> 02:38.842
you'll be the
only woman slated,

02:38.890 --> 02:40.289
and thus, a shoo-in.

02:40.320 --> 02:42.686
That's how I became
chief justice.

02:42.730 --> 02:46.188
But it means leaving
all this behind.

02:46.230 --> 02:48.198
I, um...

02:48.230 --> 02:49.925
I don't know what to say.

02:49.970 --> 02:52.530
Say yes.

02:52.570 --> 02:54.231
Can I take a few days?

02:54.270 --> 02:57.307
You can take a week.

02:57.340 --> 02:59.535
You've done well, Diane.

02:59.580 --> 03:01.605
Claim your prize.

03:04.280 --> 03:06.510
You want Ter_rance
to plead gurlty?

03:06.550 --> 03:08.916
I want him to go home--
the plea is just

03:08.950 --> 03:10.588
a formality, Thalia,
that's all.

03:10.620 --> 03:12.588
And it's just a
minor misdemeanor.

03:12.620 --> 03:14.508
But he'll have
a crImInal record.

03:14.560 --> 03:15.959
That will be expunged

03:15.990 --> 03:17.787
when his
probation's
finished.

03:17.830 --> 03:18.979
He's not a criminal.

03:19.030 --> 03:20.657
I know.

03:20.700 --> 03:22.691
What do you
think, Terrance?

03:22.730 --> 03:24.960
I don't know.
Do you think
you could go

03:25.000 --> 03:28.333
in front of a judge,
tell him what you did
and apologize for it?

03:28.370 --> 03:30.258
I guess.

03:30.310 --> 03:32.301
I am sorry.

03:32.340 --> 03:33.898
I know.

03:33.940 --> 03:36.477
GRACE (over phone):
Hey, Mom, pick up the phone.
Hey, Mom, pick up the phone.

03:36.510 --> 03:37.977
I-It's my daughter.
I'll just be a minute.

03:38.010 --> 03:40.717
Hi, Grace.
Is everything okay?

03:40.750 --> 03:41.819
Yeah, everything's good.

03:41.850 --> 03:43.545
So, can Shannon
come over today?

03:43.590 --> 03:44.545
Who's Shannon?

03:44.590 --> 03:45.943
She's a girl in my class.

03:45.990 --> 03:47.309
How old are you?
13.

03:47.360 --> 03:48.611
She's 13, too.

03:48.660 --> 03:50.321
My mom said I can go.

03:50.360 --> 03:51.725
Her mom says it's okay.

03:51.760 --> 03:52.954
ALICIA:
Is it all right
with Jackie?

03:53.000 --> 03:54.251
Yeah, she said it's fine.

03:54.300 --> 03:56.029
She just wanted me
to ask you first.

03:56.060 --> 03:56.958
Okay, then,

03:57.000 --> 03:58.820
uh, just help Grandma
with any cleanup.

03:58.870 --> 03:59.837
Yeah.

03:59.870 --> 04:01.269
Oh... guess what, Mom?

04:01.300 --> 04:02.267
What?

04:02.310 --> 04:03.368
Her dad's in prison, too.

04:04.810 --> 04:06.437
I'll see you tonight.

04:06.480 --> 04:07.572
(both giggle)

04:10.480 --> 04:12.744
Six months' probation,
a hundred hours'

04:12.780 --> 04:13.849
community service.

04:13.880 --> 04:15.814
You're lucky it's
Christmastime,
Mr. Thompson.

04:15.850 --> 04:17.488
Defecate again
in your neighbor's closet,

04:17.520 --> 04:18.942
I won't be so jolly.

04:18.990 --> 04:21.458
And who's our next
contestant, Danny?

04:21.490 --> 04:23.424
Terrance Ramsay,
Your Honor.

04:23.460 --> 04:25.428
Young Master

04:25.460 --> 04:27.018
Terrance Ramsay.

04:27.060 --> 04:28.459
Where are his glasses?

04:28.500 --> 04:29.728
Oh, he's fine
without them.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.294
No, just, can
I have them?

04:31.330 --> 04:32.661
Where's your counselor,
young man?

04:32.700 --> 04:33.769
Here, Your Honor.

04:33.800 --> 04:34.596
Oh, good!
Shall we all gather

04:34.640 --> 04:36.562
around the campfire
here, Counselor?

04:36.610 --> 04:38.566
I understand you've
reached a plea agreement,

04:38.610 --> 04:39.804
Mr. Richardson?

04:39.840 --> 04:41.034
Yes, Your Honor.
Mr. Ramsay

04:41.080 --> 04:43.048
has agreed to plead guilty
to simple assault.

04:43.080 --> 04:44.604
Is that correct,
Mr. Ramsay?

04:44.650 --> 04:45.742
You're ready to plead guilty?

04:45.780 --> 04:47.077
Yes, sir.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.678
Mr. Ramsay,
you understand

04:48.720 --> 04:51.041
that you have
the right...

04:51.090 --> 04:54.810
Is there a problem, Counselor?

04:54.860 --> 04:56.088
No, Your Honor.
Does Mr. Ramsay

04:56.120 --> 04:58.384
need his glasses to see me?

04:58.430 --> 04:59.692
Ms...?

04:59.730 --> 05:00.958
Florrick, Your Honor.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.399
Florrick.

05:02.430 --> 05:03.829
Wow.

05:03.870 --> 05:05.497
Well, we're in for a treat
today, aren't we, Danny?

05:05.530 --> 05:06.690
Some good old

05:06.740 --> 05:07.866
Florrick magic.

05:07.900 --> 05:09.436
Why don't you take
off those glasses

05:09.470 --> 05:10.539
and put them
in your pocket, son.

05:10.570 --> 05:12.504
To the charge

05:12.540 --> 05:14.405
of simple assault,

05:14.440 --> 05:16.032
how do you plead,
Mr. Ramsay?

05:16.080 --> 05:17.547
Guilty, Your Honor.

05:17.580 --> 05:19.514
And in your own words,
why don't you

05:19.550 --> 05:20.710
tell us what happened?

05:21.880 --> 05:23.541
At lunch, Reggie said

05:23.590 --> 05:26.616
he was gonna beat me up
after school.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.719
He called me
a little bitch.

05:28.760 --> 05:30.387
A-And he said
he was gonna

05:30.430 --> 05:32.398
break my glasses.

05:32.430 --> 05:35.058
He scared me,
and I threw my book at him.

05:35.100 --> 05:36.590
And the State's recommendation?

05:36.630 --> 05:40.088
One year probation
and 200_ hours _of
community serVIce.

05:40.140 --> 05:43.109
Mm-hmm.

05:43.140 --> 05:44.107
(Judge sighs loudly)

05:44.140 --> 05:46.677
Yo_u_ca_used some serious
Injuries, Mr. Ramsay.

05:46.710 --> 05:49.076
Broken eye socket,
stitches. . .

05:49.110 --> 05:51.544
The other child is recovering
quite well, Your Honor.

05:51.580 --> 05:53.047
Break a nose,

05:53.080 --> 05:54.775
and your punishment
is picking up trash?

05:55.980 --> 05:57.789
What's the
lesson there?

05:57.820 --> 05:59.412
Your Honor, I would
just like to say--

05:59.460 --> 06:00.757
The agreement
that you have,

06:00.790 --> 06:03.156
Mr. Ramsay, is between
you and the government,

06:03.190 --> 06:05.158
and as such, I am not party
to that agreement

06:05.190 --> 06:06.623
and can impose
a harsher sentence.

06:06.660 --> 06:07.991
Do you
understand that?

06:08.030 --> 06:09.918
Mr. Ramsay...

06:09.970 --> 06:12.165
I am sentencing you
to nine months' detention.

06:12.200 --> 06:14.668
You will receive
the gundance you need

06:14.700 --> 06:15.962
to be_com_e_a
productive cntlzen,

06:16.000 --> 06:17.137
and come to
understand

06:17.170 --> 06:19.707
that actions have consequences.

06:19.740 --> 06:22.174
No, Your Honor...
This will be the best thing
for you, I promise.

06:22.210 --> 06:24.542
Your Honor, I'm sorry,
but we had an agreement:
no jail time.

06:24.580 --> 06:25.842
(bangs gavel)
Next contestant.

06:25.880 --> 06:26.847
No, wait!

06:26.880 --> 06:28.541
Mom!
Terrance?

06:28.580 --> 06:30.719
What the hell
is going on here?

06:30.750 --> 06:32.456
JUDGE: Young Master
Marcus Townsend.
TERRANCE:
Mom!

06:32.490 --> 06:33.684
Terrance?

06:40.860 --> 06:44.864
Captioning sponsored by
CBS TELEVISION

06:54.210 --> 06:57.179
(low, indistinct
conversation)

07:01.220 --> 07:03.780
This where you
come to celebrate?

07:03.820 --> 07:06.459
Your_ boss wanted
SIX months.

07:06.490 --> 07:07.479
You got nine.

07:07.520 --> 07:10.648
Florrick is not the most
popular name around here.

07:10.690 --> 07:12.453
Oh, that is not
what this is about.

07:12.500 --> 07:13.455
That was a
bait-and-switch.

07:13.500 --> 07:14.649
Oh, come on.

07:14.700 --> 07:17.225
A judge has indigestion,
you get six months;

07:17.270 --> 07:19.636
he has a good meal,
someone goes free.

07:19.670 --> 07:21.592
It balances itself out.
Not for Terence Ramsay.

07:21.640 --> 07:23.232
Then what do
you want to do?

07:23.270 --> 07:27.639
You act like this
isn't the water we're
both SWImmIng In?

07:28.880 --> 07:30.848
Baxter is well-liked,

07:30.880 --> 07:33.678
but he's all over _
the map With sentencmg.

07:35.120 --> 07:37.441
Someone just complained
last week.

07:39.190 --> 07:41.715
You think your kid got screwed,

07:41.760 --> 07:44.581
talk to Howard Brightman
at Legal Aid.

07:47.230 --> 07:49.118
SHANNON: That's not
the entrance.

07:49.160 --> 07:50.798
I think that's
for the guards.

07:50.830 --> 07:52.024
So, how often do you go?

07:52.070 --> 07:53.537
To see my dad?

07:53.570 --> 07:54.730
Every month.

07:54.770 --> 07:56.533
It's far.

07:56.570 --> 07:57.798
What's yours?

07:57.840 --> 07:59.637
Tamms Minimum.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.238
So, what'd your dad do?

08:01.280 --> 08:02.542
Nothing.

08:02.580 --> 08:04.548
I mean, he says
he didn't,

08:04.580 --> 08:06.571
but they say
he sold drugs.

08:06.620 --> 08:08.918
Crystal.

08:09.950 --> 08:11.508
Wow.
That's not bad.

08:11.550 --> 08:13.154
So, what did he
say happened?

08:13.190 --> 08:14.714
He was set up.

08:14.760 --> 08:16.113
(laughs)

08:16.160 --> 08:17.081
Yeah, my dad, too.

08:17.130 --> 08:20.520
I think your dad's prison
is nicer than mine.

08:20.560 --> 08:22.892
(both laugh, knock at door)

08:22.930 --> 08:24.124
Thought I'd make

08:24.170 --> 08:26.593
some snacks _
for you young ladies.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.596
What are we looking at here?

08:28.640 --> 08:29.902
Nothing. Thanks, Grandma.

08:29.940 --> 08:31.862
We're comparing
prisons.

08:31.910 --> 08:33.775
I don't
understand.

08:33.810 --> 08:35.607
Shannon's joking.

08:35.640 --> 08:36.800
We're fine. Thanks.

08:36.850 --> 08:39.671
So, Shannon, is your mother
picking you up?

08:39.720 --> 08:40.744
No. I have my bike.

08:40.780 --> 08:43.089
Your bike? Where do you live?

08:43.120 --> 08:45.008
Garfield Park, on Lake.

08:45.050 --> 08:46.654
I think I should
phone your mother.

08:46.690 --> 08:47.679
No. We're fine.

08:47.720 --> 08:48.414
Thanks, Grandma.

08:48.460 --> 08:50.587
We have to do
homework now. Bye.

08:52.360 --> 08:54.157
So she's the one
who took you there?

08:54.200 --> 08:56.293
It's like she thinks
he's staying at a country club.

08:56.330 --> 08:57.661
Not a good one.

08:57.700 --> 08:59.930
(laughing):
Definitely not.

08:59.970 --> 09:01.995
ALICIA:
Thanks for agreeing to meet,
Mr. Brightman.

09:02.040 --> 09:03.564
Howie.

09:03.610 --> 09:05.339
So, do you always

09:05.370 --> 09:07.600
put out a buffet
like that?

09:07.640 --> 09:08.629
Oh, would you
like something?

09:08.680 --> 09:09.578
A muffin or
something?

09:09.610 --> 09:10.804
No, no. I'm fine.

09:10.850 --> 09:12.613
So, yeah, um...

09:12.650 --> 09:14.845
you're interested in my client,
Damien Harkin?

09:14.880 --> 09:15.869
Mm-hmm.

09:15.920 --> 09:17.649
Kid stole a chicken
from Costco.

09:17.690 --> 09:18.987
Richardson agreed
to a plea

09:19.020 --> 09:21.318
of simple theft,
and supervised release,

09:21.360 --> 09:23.885
but Judge Baxter
gave him nine months.

09:23.930 --> 09:25.352
And you filed a
motion to reconsider.

09:25.390 --> 09:26.698
You bet I did.

09:26.730 --> 09:27.754
Baxter denied it.

09:27.800 --> 09:29.597
On what grounds?

09:29.630 --> 09:31.097
_ Sentence
Within gUIdelines,

09:31.130 --> 09:32.734
judicial discretion.

09:32.770 --> 09:35.193
So, every day,
they just put out all that food?

09:35.240 --> 09:36.969
Every day.

09:37.010 --> 09:38.602
Why don't you...

09:38.640 --> 09:40.301
No, no.
I had lunch.

09:40.340 --> 09:42.740
Baxter is a bipolar sentencer,
but nobody wants

09:42.780 --> 09:45.874
to confront him because we all
gotta go back there.

09:45.910 --> 09:48.071
You're looking to file
a motion to reconsider?
I am.

09:49.650 --> 09:52.778
Last year, we started
segregating cases by judges.

09:52.820 --> 09:55.983
These are all
Baxter cases.

09:56.990 --> 09:59.322
Maybe I'll just grab one.

09:59.360 --> 10:00.896
Please.

10:30.060 --> 10:32.051
*

10:42.470 --> 10:44.700
Wow.

10:44.740 --> 10:46.367
Yes.

10:47.410 --> 10:48.434
Your Honor.

10:48.480 --> 10:50.675
(both chuckling)

10:52.750 --> 10:55.014
It's not a given.
Sure it is.

10:55.050 --> 10:57.348
Cook County Democrats say
you're a judge, you're a judge.

10:57.390 --> 10:58.743
Vote's a formality.

10:58.790 --> 10:59.859
So you think I should.

10:59.890 --> 11:01.357
I think you'd be
crazy not to.

11:01.390 --> 11:03.187
These chances
don't come along every day.

11:03.230 --> 11:04.788
And the firm?

11:06.490 --> 11:08.094
We survived losing Stern.

11:08.130 --> 11:10.928
We'll... survive losing you.

11:10.970 --> 11:12.164
And my people?

11:12.200 --> 11:14.168
Your people?

11:14.200 --> 11:15.838
The lawyers
who came over with me.

11:15.870 --> 11:16.802
That's funny,

11:16.840 --> 11:18.137
I thought they
were our people.

11:18.170 --> 11:20.172
Isn't that what we said
the first day-- no fiefdoms?

11:20.210 --> 11:22.303
We also said we wouldn't
stab each other in the back.

11:22.340 --> 11:24.808
Oh, and we didn't.

11:24.850 --> 11:26.772
Stern left
of his own free will.

11:29.380 --> 11:31.086
Just promise me
you won't clean house.

11:31.120 --> 11:33.714
Diane...

11:33.760 --> 11:35.751
If it were the reverse,

11:35.790 --> 11:38.088
would you promise me?

11:45.870 --> 11:47.861
Congratulations, Diane.

11:55.380 --> 11:58.201
Ah...

11:58.250 --> 11:59.979
CARY:
So, aren't you

12:00.020 --> 12:02.079
lead attorney
on Sheffrin-Marks?

12:02.120 --> 12:03.439
Why are we doing this?

12:03.490 --> 12:04.787
This is Sheffrin-Marks.

12:04.820 --> 12:05.787
Well, Sheffrin, anyway.

12:05.820 --> 12:08.118
He asked us to take care
of his housekeeper's kid

12:08.160 --> 12:11.789
and Alicia promptly went out
and got him locked up.

12:11.830 --> 12:13.229
Sorry.

12:13.260 --> 12:15.251
These are all
from Legal Aid.

12:15.300 --> 12:16.426
Baxter's cases.

12:16.460 --> 12:18.428
On this side, everybody
got probation.

12:18.470 --> 12:20.461
On that, jail time.

12:20.500 --> 12:22.809
So you're filing a motion
to reconsider, based on what?

12:24.140 --> 12:26.904
He's a racist.

12:26.940 --> 12:28.828
I'd take this up to Will,
get his advice.

12:28.880 --> 12:30.438
No. You're barking
up the wrong tree.

12:30.480 --> 12:32.539
Baxter's old-school liberal,
Million Man March, all that.

12:32.580 --> 12:35.845
And, of course,
liberals can't be racists.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.848
Hey, I'm just...

12:37.890 --> 12:39.778
20 cases doesn't mean anything.

12:39.820 --> 12:42.050
We need to know the race of
everyone else Baxter sentenced,

12:42.090 --> 12:43.250
and then do _
a regressmn analy5is

12:43.290 --> 12:45.258
to look at other variables
that could explain the pattern.

12:47.860 --> 12:51.523
So, Kalinda, you, uh,
help Alicia with the hard data

12:51.570 --> 12:54.266
for her motion,
and use Mr. Statistics here.

12:54.300 --> 12:55.790
He has nothing
better to do.

12:55.840 --> 12:58.001
Who says I got
nothing better to do?

12:58.040 --> 13:00.304
(laughing)
I do.

13:00.340 --> 13:01.534
All right.
Thanks, man.

13:01.580 --> 13:03.309
Hey, one thing.
I wouldn't go to Will.

13:03.350 --> 13:04.476
Why?

13:04.510 --> 13:06.000
He's best buds
with Baxter.

13:06.050 --> 13:07.039
How do you know?

13:07.080 --> 13:08.843
I researched all
the partners.

13:08.880 --> 13:10.086
Didn't you?

13:10.120 --> 13:12.042
Thanks.

13:23.400 --> 13:25.595
ALICIA: I could be wrong.
It's a small sampling.

13:25.630 --> 13:26.767
Get a larger one.

13:26.800 --> 13:29.963
So you think I should pursue
the biased sentencing charge?

13:30.010 --> 13:31.034
What else do you have?

13:31.070 --> 13:33.607
Mitigation.
Or withdraw the plea.

13:33.640 --> 13:36.473
Argue that Baxter didn't
properly admonish Terrance.

13:36.510 --> 13:37.579
Maybe on an appeal,

13:37.610 --> 13:40.977
but you have to get back
to Baxter with this motion.

13:41.020 --> 13:43.909
When Illinois still
had the death penalty,

13:43.950 --> 13:45.838
juries were ten
times more likely

13:45.890 --> 13:48.415
to sentence an African-
American than a white one.

13:48.460 --> 13:51.054
I challenged three death
sentences with that argument.

13:51.090 --> 13:53.194
And did _it work?
TWIce.

13:53.230 --> 13:55.221
Judges should know
they can't get away

13:55.260 --> 13:57.091
with bias in
sentencmg.

13:57.130 --> 13:59.166
But _I don't want
to fight a cause

13:59.200 --> 14:00.861
at the expense
of a client.

14:00.900 --> 14:02.094
You won't.

14:02.140 --> 14:03.903
Get a larger sampling.

14:03.940 --> 14:06.465
Don't make your argument
specific to Baxter.

14:06.510 --> 14:08.034
Throw in a few
other judges, too.

14:08.080 --> 14:10.048
If Baxter is smart,

14:10.080 --> 14:11.968
h_e'll read between the
lines and reconSIder.

14:12.010 --> 14:14.012
You know Judge Baxter
is a friend of Will's?

14:14.050 --> 14:15.915
I don't see
the relevance.

14:15.950 --> 14:17.178
This isn't personal.

14:17.220 --> 14:19.984
A judge's job is to be
an impartial arbiter.

14:20.020 --> 14:22.250
Two lifeguards
to every swimmer.

14:25.090 --> 14:27.297
If Baxter fails, it's
in everybody's interest

14:27.330 --> 14:28.456
to make that known.

14:28.500 --> 14:30.889
Thank you.
No problem.

14:30.930 --> 14:33.194
You should knock on my
door more often, Alicia.

14:33.240 --> 14:34.992
I will.

14:35.040 --> 14:36.928
You're doing a good job.

14:38.410 --> 14:41.504
My apologies if I haven't
told you that until now.

14:43.950 --> 14:45.941
Thank you.

14:50.420 --> 14:52.980
Her name is Shannon.
She rode her bike here.

14:53.020 --> 14:54.954
She wouldn't let me
phone her mother.

14:54.990 --> 14:56.389
Mm-hmm?

14:56.420 --> 15:00.925
Well, I-I just think she's
a little mature for Grace.

15:00.960 --> 15:02.928
_ Her father's
in prison, you know.

15:02.970 --> 15:04.619
Jackie, your
son's in prison.

15:04.670 --> 15:06.695
Well, yes, but he's not
in Statesville.

15:06.730 --> 15:09.198
(laughs quietly)

15:09.240 --> 15:11.936
What?

15:11.970 --> 15:13.232
I wish I could laugh about it.

15:13.280 --> 15:14.304
I'm not laughing
about it.

15:14.340 --> 15:15.637
I'm laughing about you.

15:15.680 --> 15:19.241
Oh, well, yes, that
would be me-- figure of fun.

15:19.280 --> 15:23.216
Look, I'm just glad
that Grace has a friend.

15:23.250 --> 15:25.582
She's been slow to
make friends at school.

15:25.620 --> 15:28.009
(scoffs)

15:28.060 --> 15:29.709
Then let me introduce her

15:29.760 --> 15:32.149
to some friends at the DLC.

15:32.190 --> 15:33.589
Oh, no, Jackie,
not the debutante stuff.

15:33.630 --> 15:35.450
Well, it's not
the way it used to be.

15:35.500 --> 15:37.320
You know, there are
black cotillions,

15:37.370 --> 15:38.496
Mexican cotillions;

15:38.530 --> 15:41.328
the girls work
in soup kitchens.

15:41.370 --> 15:42.496
(uncomfortable sigh)

15:42.540 --> 15:43.666
Jackie, why...

15:43.710 --> 15:46.508
why don't we just let Gracie
pick her own friends, okay?

15:48.580 --> 15:50.548
Have you even asked Grace

15:50.580 --> 15:52.707
what her friend's father
is in prison for?

15:52.750 --> 15:54.968
D-Don't you think we should
at least find that out?

15:55.020 --> 15:56.339
What if it's
something bad?

15:56.380 --> 15:58.018
What if it is?

15:58.050 --> 15:59.449
She's not her father.

15:59.490 --> 16:01.151
(phone ringing)

16:01.760 --> 16:03.421
Hello?

16:03.460 --> 16:05.018
Much as I hate
to admit it,

16:05.060 --> 16:06.186
Stat Boy may
have something.

16:06.230 --> 16:08.050
We looked at all the kids

16:08.100 --> 16:10.193
Baxter sent to detention,
sorted by date.

16:10.230 --> 16:11.561
The racial pattern
didn't exist before--

16:11.600 --> 16:15.195
The racial pattern didn't
exist before June 2008.

16:15.240 --> 16:16.195
Why?

16:16.240 --> 16:18.060
I still don't_know
if it's raCIsm

16:18.110 --> 16:19.236
or if it's
something else.

16:19.270 --> 16:21.238
Do you want to
talk to her?
Nah.

16:21.280 --> 16:22.679
KALINDA:
Look, we don't know,

16:22.710 --> 16:25.508
but something in June
changed for Baxter.

16:25.550 --> 16:26.676
What?

16:26.710 --> 16:29.178
I don't know.

16:29.220 --> 16:30.289
Can you find out?

16:30.320 --> 16:33.118
Oh, yeah.

16:38.430 --> 16:40.227
Went for it, huh?

16:40.260 --> 16:41.488
I had to.

16:48.200 --> 16:50.065
It's a beautiful day
today, isn't it, Danny?

16:51.310 --> 16:53.073
So let's all
take a short break, shall we?

16:53.110 --> 16:54.236
Everybody get
some sunshine.

16:54.280 --> 16:56.430
Counselor-- in chambers.

16:58.280 --> 17:00.043
Not you,
Mr. Richards.

17:13.430 --> 17:15.751
Have some birthday cake?

17:15.800 --> 17:17.688
No, thank you,
Your Honor.

17:17.730 --> 17:19.197
Happy Birthday.

17:19.230 --> 17:22.131
It's not mine.
Court reporter.

17:28.210 --> 17:30.075
(Baxter groans)

17:33.320 --> 17:35.675
So...

17:35.720 --> 17:38.416
I'm biased against
African-Americans, huh?

17:38.450 --> 17:40.759
Your Honor, we looked
at five years of--
Who's that?

17:42.160 --> 17:43.479
President Obama,

17:43.530 --> 17:45.122
Senator Burris...

17:45.160 --> 17:47.196
I don't think I need to take
lessons from you, ma'am.

17:47.230 --> 17:48.652
I didn't think I was
trying to teach you any--

17:48.700 --> 17:50.292
What was your husband's
record on racial issues?

17:50.330 --> 17:51.820
I mean,
before he went to prison?

17:51.870 --> 17:53.690
Your Honor, this isn't
about my husband.

17:53.740 --> 17:55.731
You're damn right
it's not; it's about me.

17:55.770 --> 17:57.237
You sentenced
Terrance Ramsay too har--

17:57.270 --> 17:59.135
Do not interrupt me!

17:59.170 --> 18:01.229
Who the hell are you?

18:01.280 --> 18:03.202
I'm a lawyer
in your court, sir.

18:03.250 --> 18:05.445
I'm a lawyer who
filed a motion to...

18:05.480 --> 18:08.142
Did you consider the education
of the defendant

18:08.180 --> 18:10.239
in your little
statistical jeremiad?

18:10.290 --> 18:12.212
Did you consider
family structure,

18:12.250 --> 18:14.411
community services,
quality of representation?

18:14.460 --> 18:16.416
No.

18:16.460 --> 18:18.325
You went right to race,
didn't you?

18:20.260 --> 18:21.898
My motion didn't
single you out, sir.

18:21.930 --> 18:23.295
And how clever
was that?

18:23.330 --> 18:25.628
Nice one. Warning shot.

18:25.670 --> 18:27.160
Send Mr. Ramsay
home or else.

18:27.200 --> 18:28.792
That's not what
I was trying to do.

18:28.840 --> 18:30.330
I was trying
to point out a pattern

18:30.370 --> 18:31.735
that you might not
be aware of.

18:31.770 --> 18:33.135
Look, here's the thing:

18:33.180 --> 18:35.637
I don't respond well
to being threatened,

18:35.680 --> 18:38.171
Mrs. Florrick,

18:38.210 --> 18:40.314
so why don't you
withdraw this motion

18:40.350 --> 18:42.238
before it becomes a
part of the record?

18:42.280 --> 18:44.748
Withdraw it.

18:46.690 --> 18:48.487
Are we understood?

18:51.330 --> 18:52.627
We're understood.

18:59.200 --> 19:00.758
All your cell phones.
Come on, let's go.

19:00.800 --> 19:03.234
I didn't even know Alicia
had a case before you.

19:03.270 --> 19:05.306
Pretty sure she
doesn't anymore.

19:05.340 --> 19:08.309
Ah... guess he's back
already for another lesson.

19:08.340 --> 19:10.240
Huh?

19:10.280 --> 19:11.247
How's His Honor today?

19:11.280 --> 19:13.339
His Honor's getting ready
to skywalk your ass.

19:13.380 --> 19:14.517
(laughs)

19:14.550 --> 19:16.313
How they treating
you in kiddie court?

19:16.350 --> 19:18.215
They love me.

19:18.250 --> 19:20.957
There you go, Judge.

19:20.990 --> 19:22.719
So how long's she
been at the firm?

19:22.760 --> 19:24.284
A few months.

19:24.330 --> 19:25.228
What's the case?

19:25.260 --> 19:26.887
Run of the mill.

19:26.930 --> 19:29.694
Of course, she treated it like
a matter for the Supreme Court--

19:29.730 --> 19:31.527
precedents from
death row appeals,

19:31.570 --> 19:33.765
Constitutional
references on every page.

19:33.800 --> 19:35.768
You know,
rookie mistakes.

19:35.800 --> 19:38.200
Her heart's in the right place.
She'll get there.

19:38.240 --> 19:39.832
Her heart's in
the right place?!

19:39.870 --> 19:43.545
That used to be the
quickest way to get
fired from your firm.

19:43.580 --> 19:45.571
Are you sleeping with her?

19:49.520 --> 19:51.715
Fingers crossed that
Florrick loses his appeal?

19:51.750 --> 19:53.980
Nope.

19:54.020 --> 19:55.954
Wow! You look serious.

19:55.990 --> 19:57.355
Just not sleeping with her.

19:57.390 --> 19:59.381
Not even a little bit?

20:01.460 --> 20:03.894
Not even in
your head?

20:03.930 --> 20:06.467
Hey, about this case?

20:06.500 --> 20:08.365
Do your girlfriend a favor.

20:08.400 --> 20:09.936
Tell her
to move on.

20:17.040 --> 20:18.507
What happened?

20:18.550 --> 20:20.347
They called.
They said Terrance got hurt.

20:20.380 --> 20:22.416
Now they won't
let me see him.

20:22.450 --> 20:24.338
Visiting hours
are over, ma'am.

20:24.390 --> 20:25.448
Her son got hurt.

20:25.490 --> 20:26.741
Yeah-- she can come
back tomorrow.

20:26.790 --> 20:28.610
She works and it's
an hour's drive.

20:28.660 --> 20:30.525
Could you make
an exception?
No visitors,

20:30.560 --> 20:32.027
except between
11:00 and 2:00.

20:32.060 --> 20:34.449
Could I speak
to your supervisor?
Sure.

20:34.500 --> 20:36.491
He'll be in at
9:00 tomorrow.

20:45.010 --> 20:47.308
I let him keep
the lights on at home.

20:47.340 --> 20:50.605
He's scared
of the dark.

20:50.650 --> 20:52.948
You think they let him
keep a light on in there?

20:54.380 --> 20:56.314
I don't know.

20:58.620 --> 21:01.851
I baby him too much.

21:01.890 --> 21:03.289
No matter how old,

21:03.330 --> 21:05.423
they're always
our babies.

21:05.460 --> 21:07.428
I hoped he wouldn't have
to face things like this.

21:08.700 --> 21:10.691
Just thought
ifI watched him real close...

21:13.370 --> 21:15.361
(walking away)

21:19.470 --> 21:21.335
CARY:
So, what's this?

21:21.380 --> 21:22.779
KALINDA:
Baxter's old house.
I'm meeting a friend.

21:22.810 --> 21:24.505
So don't talk,
all right?

21:24.550 --> 21:26.745
I used to work
with this guy.

21:26.780 --> 21:28.748
What's that
supposed to mean?

21:32.420 --> 21:35.309
Don't move an inch.

21:35.360 --> 21:37.453
Hey, Frank.
Kay.

21:37.490 --> 21:39.424
You bring a friend?

21:39.460 --> 21:41.098
I come in peace.

21:41.130 --> 21:45.419
Colleague.
Not my decision.

21:45.470 --> 21:47.062
What's your beef
with Judge Baxter?

21:47.100 --> 21:48.465
I don't think
I have one.

21:48.500 --> 21:49.364
Then why'd you
want to meet?

21:49.400 --> 21:51.106
I came across a crime report

21:51.140 --> 21:53.062
with your
name on it.

21:53.110 --> 21:54.429
You mind walking me
through it, Frank?

21:56.640 --> 21:58.471
Burglar broke in here.

21:58.510 --> 22:00.068
Back window.
Flipped the lock.

22:00.110 --> 22:02.647
The judge wasn't home.
Only his wife.

22:02.680 --> 22:05.046
No warning from
the security system?

22:05.090 --> 22:07.581
Mm-mm.
And what did the guy want?

22:07.620 --> 22:09.815
Mrs. Baxter
said it was robbery.

22:09.860 --> 22:11.487
Said?

22:11.530 --> 22:12.679
She was pretty
shaken up.

22:12.730 --> 22:14.425
She had a cut on her cheek,

22:14.460 --> 22:16.655
wrist looked like somebody
had been handling her.

22:16.700 --> 22:17.724
Rape.

22:17.770 --> 22:20.898
CARY: Why lie about
being raped?

22:20.940 --> 22:22.862
Cary, want to go
and sit in the car?

22:25.410 --> 22:26.468
I couldn't find

22:26.510 --> 22:28.137
a case file
in the S.A.'s office.

22:28.180 --> 22:29.408
You never caught the guy.

22:29.440 --> 22:30.543
Bad description?

22:30.580 --> 22:31.842
No, good description.

22:31.880 --> 22:34.474
His Honor phoned later.

22:34.520 --> 22:36.442
Said his wife
just wanted to drop it.

22:36.480 --> 22:38.846
She happen to mention
the race of the perp?

22:40.490 --> 22:41.457
Yeah.
African-American.

22:41.490 --> 22:42.718
Why?

22:44.830 --> 22:46.957
And this happened
in the summer of 2008.

22:46.990 --> 22:50.460
Yep.

22:50.500 --> 22:51.694
June.

22:53.570 --> 22:55.561
I don't believe it.

22:55.600 --> 22:56.828
People aren't
that simple.

22:56.870 --> 22:58.508
People are
exactly that simple.

22:58.540 --> 22:59.837
Before the assault,

22:59.870 --> 23:01.576
Baxter's sentencing is
race-neutral.

23:01.610 --> 23:02.634
After, it's not.

23:02.680 --> 23:04.102
Yeah, but that
could be anything.

23:04.150 --> 23:05.344
People do things
for a hundred reasons.

23:05.380 --> 23:08.178
No, people like to think
they do things for
a hundred reasons.

23:08.220 --> 23:09.972
They do things
for one reason.

23:10.020 --> 23:11.112
For what reason?

23:11.150 --> 23:13.653
Come on, Yoda--
what reason?

23:13.690 --> 23:16.750
Sex, money, hatred, love.

23:16.790 --> 23:18.655
You want to make people
mysterious.

23:18.690 --> 23:19.850
People aren't mysterious.

23:19.890 --> 23:21.755
Okay, then the same
thing goes for you.

23:21.800 --> 23:23.051
You're not mysterious.

23:23.100 --> 23:25.193
By the same logic,
you're completely knowable.

23:25.230 --> 23:26.697
Sure.

23:26.730 --> 23:28.197
Okay, so then hit me.

23:28.240 --> 23:30.708
I want to know.

23:30.740 --> 23:32.503
Go ahead.

23:32.540 --> 23:39.139
Cary, you and I have
nothing in common

23:39.180 --> 23:41.045
'cause you and I are
from different worlds.

23:41.080 --> 23:42.513
And it's not just

23:42.550 --> 23:46.919
Mars and Venus,
it's spaghetti and hydrogen.

23:46.950 --> 23:49.714
We're different categories.

23:49.760 --> 23:52.627
I'm knowable,
but just not to you.

23:56.730 --> 23:59.460
GRACE:
I just want things
to be normal.

23:59.500 --> 24:01.195
Everybody else's dads
are normal.

24:01.240 --> 24:03.708
Maybe nothing's normal.

24:03.740 --> 24:05.503
I mean,

24:05.540 --> 24:07.474
maybe we decide what's normal.

24:07.510 --> 24:09.068
(scoffs)
You and me?

24:09.110 --> 24:10.236
Yeah!

24:10.280 --> 24:13.511
Okay, what do you want
to be normal?

24:13.550 --> 24:15.518
Oh, I don't know--
eating dessert for breakfast?

24:15.550 --> 24:17.780
Okay, that's normal now.

24:17.820 --> 24:19.515
(laughs)

24:19.550 --> 24:20.756
No school on Thursdays.

24:20.790 --> 24:21.916
No, Mondays.

24:21.960 --> 24:23.109
Those are really bad.

24:23.160 --> 24:25.754
Living in Chicago is abnormal.

24:25.790 --> 24:28.497
(doorbell rings)
Yeah, really abnormal.

24:30.600 --> 24:31.794
Hi, I'm Shannon's mother.

24:31.830 --> 24:33.559
Oh, hello.

24:33.600 --> 24:34.635
Nice to meet you.

24:34.670 --> 24:37.559
Ijust... um... I'm sorry.

24:37.610 --> 24:39.635
I need to take Shannon home now.

24:39.670 --> 24:41.103
Oh, I'm glad you came.

24:41.140 --> 24:43.677
I was worried about Shannon
riding her bike home.

24:43.710 --> 24:46.178
Please come in.

24:46.210 --> 24:47.677
Actually, no, I can't.
I'm sorry.

24:47.720 --> 24:48.869
We have to...

24:48.920 --> 24:51.809
We're in a bit of a rush.

24:51.850 --> 24:54.114
Grace...

24:54.160 --> 24:56.720
Shannon,
your mother's here!

24:56.760 --> 24:58.978
So you live in Garfield Park.

24:59.030 --> 25:00.657
Yes.

25:00.700 --> 25:02.019
GRACE:
Yeah? What?

25:02.060 --> 25:03.925
"Yes," what.

25:03.970 --> 25:05.892
Shannon's mother's here.

25:05.930 --> 25:08.091
Hey, Mom.
Uh, this is Grace.

25:08.140 --> 25:09.562
Hi. I'm sorry.

25:09.600 --> 25:11.204
We have to go.

25:11.240 --> 25:12.730
Do you have your homework?

25:15.280 --> 25:16.304
See you tomorrow.

25:16.340 --> 25:17.568
Bye.

25:21.720 --> 25:23.142
What'd you say to her?

25:23.180 --> 25:24.989
Nothing.

25:29.690 --> 25:31.624
Baxter should
have disclosed this.

25:31.660 --> 25:32.820
KALIN DA:
They arrested a guy

25:32.860 --> 25:34.794
who fit the description
Mrs. Baxter gave them,

25:34.830 --> 25:36.821
but she wouldn't come in to ID.

25:36.860 --> 25:38.020
Wasn't up to it.

25:38.070 --> 25:39.924
Baxter asked them
to let it go.

25:39.970 --> 25:41.289
What can I do with this?

25:41.340 --> 25:42.762
Not much.

25:42.800 --> 25:44.131
Judges are human.

25:44.170 --> 25:45.660
How's your
kid doing?

25:45.710 --> 25:46.631
My kid?

25:46.670 --> 25:47.830
Oh, Terrance.

25:47.880 --> 25:49.700
Fractured arm, some bruises.

25:49.740 --> 25:51.708
He's recovering.
He's still in the infirmary?

25:51.750 --> 25:54.674
He goes back into general
population in two days.

25:54.720 --> 25:56.142
Not a lot of time to work with.

25:56.180 --> 25:58.080
The way I see it,
it doesn't make sense

25:58.120 --> 25:59.940
to go back to Baxter
with the same motion.

25:59.990 --> 26:02.049
We should try to take the cases
away from him.

26:02.090 --> 26:04.923
File a motion
to substitute for cause.

26:04.960 --> 26:09.795
Let me try a more direct route.

26:09.830 --> 26:13.732
And Sheffrin-Marks--
that's your client or Will's?

26:13.770 --> 26:14.964
Both of ours.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.297
But he brought
it in.

26:16.340 --> 26:18.137
Uh, yes. Why?

26:18.170 --> 26:20.229
We would rather
it not be you.

26:20.270 --> 26:21.771
It doesn't look good

26:21.810 --> 26:23.277
representing
a pharmaceutical company

26:23.310 --> 26:25.346
against 300 working-class
plaintiffs.

26:25.380 --> 26:26.699
And your name,
"Lockhart."

26:26.750 --> 26:27.500
That's an English name?

26:27.550 --> 26:29.347
We don't need to
bring that up now.

26:29.380 --> 26:30.642
What's wrong with my name?

26:30.690 --> 26:32.646
Well, the electorate
is 19% Irish.

26:32.690 --> 26:34.658
They go for
an Irish name.

26:35.820 --> 26:38.653
I know-- the things
we have to think about.

26:38.690 --> 26:40.658
I think a speech

26:40.700 --> 26:44.625
to the Irish-American Heritage
Center handles the problem.

26:48.270 --> 26:50.033
Could you give us a minute?

26:55.280 --> 26:56.804
What's wrong?

26:57.810 --> 26:59.346
Do you know a Henry Baxter?

26:59.380 --> 27:00.745
Yes.

27:00.780 --> 27:01.815
Juvenile court?

27:01.850 --> 27:04.683
Yes, I know.

27:04.720 --> 27:07.211
You have a junior associate
accusing him of racism.

27:07.250 --> 27:10.754
No-- biased sentencing.

27:10.790 --> 27:13.020
I'm glad you brought
this up, Diane.

27:13.060 --> 27:15.426
That's what I like about you--

27:15.460 --> 27:17.189
very direct.

27:17.230 --> 27:19.369
I was gonna talk
to you about it.

27:19.400 --> 27:20.992
You need to talk to her.

27:21.040 --> 27:23.702
. Who? .
Your junior assoaate.

27:23.740 --> 27:25.298
Ask her to apologize
to Baxter.

27:25.340 --> 27:26.409
You're kidding.

27:26.440 --> 27:28.328
No.

27:30.080 --> 27:32.105
You said you wanted
to get rid of the swimmers.

27:32.150 --> 27:33.105
More lifeguards.

27:33.150 --> 27:34.879
Yes.

27:34.920 --> 27:37.787
Baxter is a lifeguard.

27:40.390 --> 27:44.781
I... But he acts
in contravention to the law.

27:44.830 --> 27:46.024
Well,
that's a matter of opinion.

27:46.060 --> 27:48.051
No, it's not.
It's a fact.

27:50.230 --> 27:53.791
Judges don't go up
against each other, Diane.

27:53.840 --> 27:56.729
You can't question
a sitting judge.

27:56.770 --> 27:57.930
Yes, but you can.

27:58.970 --> 28:00.870
You're the
chief justice.

28:00.910 --> 28:03.845
I want to know that you're
serious about running, Diane.

28:03.880 --> 28:06.348
I've told you I am.
Yes.

28:06.380 --> 28:07.847
Now you have to act

28:07.880 --> 28:09.768
like you are.

28:13.290 --> 28:15.212
Talk to your junior associate.

28:15.260 --> 28:19.026
It's one kid sentenced--
that's all.

28:19.060 --> 28:20.823
Don't turn over
the apple cart

28:20.860 --> 28:22.054
because of one kid.

28:26.200 --> 28:28.259
(door shuts firmly)

28:38.310 --> 28:39.379
No continuance.

28:42.850 --> 28:43.817
Excuse me, Your Honor?

28:43.850 --> 28:45.943
I said no continuance.
We're gomg to trial.

28:45.990 --> 28:47.958
Your Honor, I...

28:47.990 --> 28:51.528
The plaintiff has acquiesced
to our request.

28:51.560 --> 28:54.199
Yes, and the bench
has not.

28:54.230 --> 28:56.323
What is so hard
to understand here, Mr. Gardner?

28:56.360 --> 28:58.294
You asked for_
a continuance, I said no.

28:58.330 --> 29:00.992
Next motion.

29:06.440 --> 29:09.329
Ant that, young sir,
is called a tax.

29:09.380 --> 29:11.803
You complained about Baxter

29:11.850 --> 29:13.909
to the chief justice?

29:13.950 --> 29:15.178
Yes.
What is this,

29:15.220 --> 29:17.347
some last parting gift
to the firm?

29:17.380 --> 29:18.984
Baxter's wife was
assaulted,

29:19.020 --> 29:20.817
and he's been sentencing
from his bias ever since.

29:20.860 --> 29:21.815
You don't know that.

29:21.860 --> 29:23.851
You don't know why
anybody decides anything.

29:23.890 --> 29:24.925
I have eyes.

29:24.960 --> 29:25.858
And you'd
have them, too,

29:25.890 --> 29:26.982
if he weren't a friend.

29:27.030 --> 29:28.827
And what?
Seriously, what?

29:28.860 --> 29:29.997
You gonna recall
ajudge?

29:30.030 --> 29:31.122
Let's figure out
how that works

29:31.170 --> 29:32.990
'cause I'd love
to see that plan.

29:33.030 --> 29:33.837
Anybody can fight city hall.

29:33.870 --> 29:35.462
What they can't fight
are judges.

29:35.500 --> 29:37.934
_ There's a kid
in prison right now.
Come on, Diane.

29:37.970 --> 29:40.109
You don't even know
his name.

29:40.140 --> 29:42.199
This stopped being
about a kid a while ago.

29:51.120 --> 29:53.111
JACKIE:
Grace?

29:54.120 --> 29:56.088
Where's Shannon?

29:56.120 --> 29:57.587
I don't know.

29:57.620 --> 29:59.588
I thought she was coming
home with you.

29:59.630 --> 30:01.052
Yeah, I thought so, too.

30:01.100 --> 30:03.921
But I guess whatever you
told her mom worked.

30:03.970 --> 30:05.926
I-I never said anything
to her mom.

30:16.010 --> 30:17.307
(sighs anxiously)

30:18.980 --> 30:21.016
(doorbell rings)

30:22.920 --> 30:24.182
(sighs anxiously)

30:28.160 --> 30:30.378
Hello?
Hello.

30:30.420 --> 30:31.921
We met yesterday.

30:31.960 --> 30:33.928
I'm Jackie,
Grace's grandmother.

30:33.960 --> 30:35.359
I'm here to pick up Grace.

30:35.400 --> 30:37.925
She's not here.
Really?

30:37.970 --> 30:40.939
She said she'd be coming here
right after school--

30:40.970 --> 30:43.461
her best friend's house.

30:43.500 --> 30:46.060
Mom?

30:46.110 --> 30:48.078
It's okay, Shannon.

30:51.210 --> 30:53.201
What do you want?

30:53.250 --> 30:55.218
I want to know why
you're doing this.

30:55.250 --> 30:56.649
I don't need
to talk to you.

30:56.680 --> 30:57.988
You're wasting water.

30:58.020 --> 30:59.009
You should turn
that off.

30:59.050 --> 31:00.540
Get off my property.

31:00.590 --> 31:04.981
Your husband is in a much worse
prison than my son.

31:05.030 --> 31:07.487
We should be worried
about you, not you us.

31:07.530 --> 31:10.226
Okay, you want to know why?

31:10.260 --> 31:13.229
Because your son
put my husband in prison.

31:13.270 --> 31:15.090
He did not.
He was the state's
attorney.

31:15.140 --> 31:17.438
My husband never
sold a drug a day in his life,

31:17.470 --> 31:20.007
and your son put him
in prison for ten years

31:20.040 --> 31:21.371
for something
he didn't do.

31:21.410 --> 31:23.139
You're a very gullible woman.

31:23.180 --> 31:24.169
And you're a bitch!

31:26.180 --> 31:28.148
My son is an honorable man.

31:28.180 --> 31:31.240
If he put your husband
in prison, he deserved it.

31:31.290 --> 31:33.281
Go to hell.

31:35.120 --> 31:37.111
Leave it alone.

31:39.060 --> 31:41.995
(gasping)

31:49.140 --> 31:51.131
We got a problem.
Really?

31:51.170 --> 31:52.967
Stat Boy says
we have a problem.

31:53.010 --> 31:56.434
Blacks go to detention,
whites go home, right?

31:56.480 --> 31:57.629
Question is why.

31:57.680 --> 31:59.079
We know why.

31:59.110 --> 32:00.077
An African-American man

32:00.110 --> 32:02.146
assaults Baxter's wife,
he starts meteing out

32:02.180 --> 32:04.319
harsher sentences to
blacks-- but look--

32:04.350 --> 32:06.318
I analyzed his sentences

32:06.350 --> 32:08.159
using two nonracial
factors.

32:08.190 --> 32:10.010
First, his family
structure.

32:15.030 --> 32:16.622
Single parent homes,

32:16.660 --> 32:17.456
two parent homes.

32:17.500 --> 32:19.559
The racial makeup
stays the same.

32:19.600 --> 32:21.295
Now, age.

32:26.010 --> 32:28.035
Under 14, over 14.

32:28.080 --> 32:29.604
The racial makeup--

32:29.640 --> 32:31.176
it's the same.

32:31.210 --> 32:33.178
There was no change in
sentencing in June of 2008?

32:33.210 --> 32:34.017
No, there is a change.

32:34.050 --> 32:35.142
It was a drastic change.

32:35.180 --> 32:36.477
But it wasn't
because of race.

32:36.520 --> 32:37.669
ALICIA:
Well, if it wasn't race,

32:37.720 --> 32:39.540
what was it?
I don't know.

32:39.590 --> 32:41.217
I'm telling you
what it's not,

32:41.260 --> 32:43.012
I can't tell you
what it is.

32:43.060 --> 32:46.052
So, the assault of Baxter's
wife is irrelevant

32:46.090 --> 32:47.352
to his change in
sentencing.

32:47.390 --> 32:48.618
No.

32:48.660 --> 32:51.458
We know it's relevant
because, in June of 2008,

32:51.500 --> 32:53.024
he started handing out
harsher sentences.

32:53.070 --> 32:55.129
But we just don't know why.

33:02.380 --> 33:04.769
We need to talk.

33:04.810 --> 33:07.108
Tomorrow.
I'm late for lunch.

33:07.150 --> 33:08.515
Henry Baxter.

33:08.550 --> 33:09.517
No.

33:09.550 --> 33:10.517
Everyone out there

33:10.550 --> 33:11.619
is pussyfooting around you

33:11.650 --> 33:12.639
because you're his friend.

33:12.690 --> 33:14.180
I said no.

33:14.220 --> 33:16.108
Look, I know
you're my boss

33:16.160 --> 33:17.787
and you can tell me
get lost when you want,

33:17.820 --> 33:18.787
but something happened.

33:18.830 --> 33:20.127
Henry is not a racist.

33:20.160 --> 33:22.151
You have any idea
what a charge

33:22.200 --> 33:23.656
like that does to somebody
in Chicago?

33:23.700 --> 33:26.123
I know he's not a racist.

33:26.170 --> 33:27.592
But something did happen, Will.

33:29.640 --> 33:33.269
He started sentencing
more harshly last June.

33:33.310 --> 33:35.699
You're his best friend.

33:35.740 --> 33:37.435
So help me.

33:37.480 --> 33:39.277
What happened?

33:41.320 --> 33:42.639
I don't know.

33:42.680 --> 33:44.511
But you suspect.
No.

33:44.550 --> 33:47.087
He borrowed some money,
that's all.

33:47.120 --> 33:48.485
How much?

33:48.520 --> 33:50.215
About $120,000.

33:50.260 --> 33:53.229
He said he was
in a tight spot.

33:53.260 --> 33:54.397
Gambling.

33:54.430 --> 33:56.159
But he was gonna make it right.

33:56.200 --> 33:57.656
Did he pay it back?

33:57.700 --> 34:00.362
Some.

34:00.400 --> 34:04.803
Say anything about an enforcer
visiting his house?

34:04.840 --> 34:06.398
A bookie's enforcer?

34:06.440 --> 34:07.759
No. Why?

34:07.810 --> 34:11.109
That's why
he dropped the charges.

34:11.150 --> 34:13.573
It wasn't rape,
he knew the attacker.

34:16.450 --> 34:18.315
What?

34:21.490 --> 34:22.809
(whispers):
Damn.

34:22.860 --> 34:24.418
What?

34:26.230 --> 34:29.290
MAN:
So you have a client
who might be sent here?

34:29.330 --> 34:31.594
_ _Yeah. He's in
juvenile court right now,

34:31.630 --> 34:33.621
but his family's really worried.

34:33.670 --> 34:35.729
Well, first of all,
I'm sorry.

34:35.770 --> 34:38.102
And second,
we're a private facility.

34:38.140 --> 34:40.301
All we do is handle
the overflow

34:40.340 --> 34:42.171
of juveniles
sentenced to Cook County.

34:42.210 --> 34:45.247
So we are very safe here.

34:45.280 --> 34:47.407
One guard to every 20 inmates.

34:47.450 --> 34:48.678
Oh, thank goodness.

34:48.720 --> 34:51.644
Then they pay you.

34:51.690 --> 34:53.317
The county does.

34:53.350 --> 34:54.214
Yes.

34:54.260 --> 34:56.353
For every juvenile,
we get a stipend.

34:56.390 --> 34:57.687
That's how it works.

34:57.720 --> 34:59.449
And how do you know
Henry Baxter?

35:00.860 --> 35:02.589
Judge Baxter?

35:02.630 --> 35:04.166
Yes.
He's a friend.

35:04.200 --> 35:05.224
You guys met, right?

35:05.270 --> 35:07.591
Sorry, he told me,
but I forgot.

35:08.640 --> 35:09.891
Through our wives.

35:09.940 --> 35:11.259
You know Ellen?
Yes.

35:11.310 --> 35:12.436
Wonderful tennis player.

35:12.470 --> 35:13.732
Yes.

35:13.770 --> 35:15.237
We went sailing.

35:15.280 --> 35:16.474
Last June?

35:16.510 --> 35:18.171
Around there.

35:18.210 --> 35:19.177
Oh, will you excuse me?

35:19.210 --> 35:20.404
This way to the exit.

35:22.450 --> 35:25.442
So is that when you
arranged the kickbacks?

35:27.420 --> 35:28.614
The...?

35:28.660 --> 35:31.481
The money you gave Henry
for sending kids to you.

35:31.530 --> 35:33.623
Whose idea was it,

35:33.660 --> 35:36.151
yours or his?

35:36.200 --> 35:38.668
Officer Michael, could
you show these two out?

35:38.700 --> 35:40.395
Come on, was it yours or his?!

35:40.430 --> 35:41.897
You better
start looking

35:41.940 --> 35:44.135
for a good defense
attorney, pal!

35:48.840 --> 35:50.307
You look good in action.

35:50.340 --> 35:52.399
(scoffs)

35:54.250 --> 35:55.376
How does this happen?

35:55.420 --> 35:57.342
It happens.

35:57.380 --> 35:59.211
So what's the solution?

35:59.250 --> 36:00.444
Don't trust anybody?

36:00.490 --> 36:02.378
Works for me.

36:11.430 --> 36:12.727
Hey.

36:14.770 --> 36:17.295
Okay, what'd I do now?

36:17.340 --> 36:18.864
Just give me an
explanation, Henry.

36:18.910 --> 36:21.674
Even a half-ass
one Will do.

36:21.710 --> 36:23.678
Okay...

36:23.710 --> 36:25.473
Thought we were working
the zone defense.

36:27.350 --> 36:29.170
Spent the morning
with your ex.

36:30.980 --> 36:32.186
Ellen.

36:33.920 --> 36:35.410
Really.

36:35.460 --> 36:37.883
So how's she doing?

36:37.920 --> 36:40.480
I asked her about
your gambling.

36:40.530 --> 36:41.827
So What is this,
an intervention?

36:41.860 --> 36:44.727
No; I Wish we had
done that a year ago.

36:44.770 --> 36:48.297
People are filling your
head With nonsense, Will.

36:48.340 --> 36:49.295
What nonsense?

36:49.340 --> 36:51.706
Like you being in debt,
your sudden interest in

36:51.740 --> 36:52.900
sending kids
to Palgrave Academy?

36:52.940 --> 36:56.000
You, my friend, are in thrall
to your junior associate.

36:56.040 --> 36:58.406
She wandered out on
some Wild tangent,

36:58.450 --> 37:00.441
and now you're
following her out there?

37:00.480 --> 37:03.347
How much does Palgrave
pay you per kid? How much?

37:03.380 --> 37:04.745
Ellen doesn't know what the
hell she's talking about.

37:04.790 --> 37:06.314
Okay? She's ill.

37:06.350 --> 37:07.248
You know that, Will.

37:07.290 --> 37:09.485
Did you even just
say the words to yourself

37:09.520 --> 37:10.418
to see how they sounded?

37:10.460 --> 37:13.623
"I'm sending kids to prison
to make money."

37:13.660 --> 37:15.298
It's not even about doing good.

37:15.330 --> 37:17.958
Nobody here is
helping orphans, but this,

37:18.000 --> 37:20.218
how can you even
live a day with this?

37:22.070 --> 37:25.528
Palgrave is a good place
for rehabilitation.

37:25.570 --> 37:27.800
These kids are
better off there.

37:27.840 --> 37:29.330
Come on.

37:29.380 --> 37:30.870
How bad do you have to behave

37:30.910 --> 37:32.343
before you start
acknowledging it.

37:32.380 --> 37:33.608
Don't you dare judge me.

37:33.650 --> 37:35.413
You--

37:35.450 --> 37:39.409
the litigator Who
whored himself out
to the lowest scum.

37:39.450 --> 37:41.350
Don't you dare judge me.

37:41.390 --> 37:44.257
You're going to jail.

37:45.930 --> 37:48.490
What?!

37:48.530 --> 37:50.259
Hey!

37:53.400 --> 37:54.992
(pop music playing faintly)

37:55.040 --> 37:57.031
(computer beeping)

38:09.980 --> 38:12.483
Your grandmother's crazy.

38:13.490 --> 38:15.481
I told you.

38:15.520 --> 38:17.454
My mother was gonna sue.

38:17.490 --> 38:19.549
I thought you weren't supposed
to be talking to me.

38:19.590 --> 38:21.820
So... let's not talk.

38:21.860 --> 38:23.725
I won't if you won't.
(laughs)

38:23.760 --> 38:26.467
So does your mom know
your grandma's crazy?

38:26.500 --> 38:28.934
She suspects it but...

38:28.970 --> 38:30.938
Wait, so,
what did your mom do?

38:30.970 --> 38:35.532
Well, she freaked out,
like, off the wall.

38:35.580 --> 38:38.799
She, like, came into the house,
head-to-toe soaking wet,

38:38.850 --> 38:42.445
like as if she, like, took a
bath or like, went for a swim.

38:42.480 --> 38:44.311
(laughing):
I'm so sorry!

38:51.790 --> 38:53.485
How you doing, Terrance?

38:53.530 --> 38:54.952
I'm okay.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.389
ADLER:
Hello.

38:57.430 --> 38:59.523
I'm Chief Justice Adler.

38:59.570 --> 39:01.629
Yes, I'm Thalia Ramsay.

39:04.970 --> 39:07.006
ADLER: And this
must be Terrance.

39:07.040 --> 39:08.405
Yes, ma'am.

39:08.440 --> 39:12.672
That judge worked
for me, Terrance.

39:12.710 --> 39:15.076
I share responsibility
for what he did.

39:15.120 --> 39:16.747
I'm very sorry.

39:16.780 --> 39:18.111
It's okay.

39:24.660 --> 39:26.628
Thank you.

39:26.660 --> 39:29.697
You don't know
how much this...

39:35.840 --> 39:38.638
It's proving more difficult
to overcome than we'd like.

39:41.510 --> 39:42.602
My English surname.

39:42.640 --> 39:44.540
Well, that
never helps.

39:44.580 --> 39:46.468
But your client roster.

39:46.510 --> 39:47.841
I'm sorry.

39:50.650 --> 39:51.912
I could still run.

39:51.950 --> 39:53.508
Yes, you could.

39:53.550 --> 39:56.587
We'd send in a ringer
to undercut your support.

39:56.620 --> 39:58.156
It wouldn't be pretty.

39:58.190 --> 39:59.680
Might still be fun.

40:00.860 --> 40:02.088
Better to wait.

40:02.130 --> 40:06.021
Let us see how you do here
the next few years.

40:06.070 --> 40:08.630
Try not to cause
any more ripples.

40:10.670 --> 40:13.798
You're filled with water
metaphors, aren't you?

40:16.880 --> 40:18.848
Again...

40:18.880 --> 40:20.507
I'm sorry
this didn't work out.

40:29.590 --> 40:31.524
Was that the kiss-off?

40:31.560 --> 40:32.982
Yep.

40:33.030 --> 40:34.827
How'd you handle it?

40:36.530 --> 40:39.021
With grace and a hint of anger.

40:39.070 --> 40:41.163
I always liked that about you.

40:41.200 --> 40:42.565
His name
was Terrance.

40:42.600 --> 40:43.862
VVho?

40:43.900 --> 40:45.538
The kid.

40:45.570 --> 40:47.765
Terrance Ramsay.

40:47.810 --> 40:49.903
He's home with
his mother now.

40:51.780 --> 40:54.647
And happiness rules.
