00:36.020 --> 00:40.650
We must begin our story, sad to say,
with an empty chair.

00:41.780 --> 00:45.280
If it were not empty,
we would not have a story.

00:45.530 --> 00:50.330
But it is, and we do, and
it is time to tell it.

01:14.640 --> 01:17.060
This is the story of my family,

01:17.310 --> 01:20.400
of my seven children,
who are all very clever

01:20.650 --> 01:24.360
but all very, very, very naughty.

01:29.700 --> 01:31.740
This is Nanny Whetstone,

01:31.990 --> 01:35.080
the 17th nanny I had hired
to look after my children.

01:35.330 --> 01:38.290
She was the strictest, the toughest

01:38.540 --> 01:42.130
and the most fearless
nanny in all the land.

01:44.130 --> 01:47.050
As I went to work that day
at the funeral parlour,

01:47.300 --> 01:49.760
I was confident in the knowledge...

01:49.890 --> 01:52.850
that there was nothing,
absolutely nothing

01:53.100 --> 01:57.060
that my children could do to upset her.

01:57.310 --> 01:59.310
They've eaten the baby!

02:00.400 --> 02:01.860
Except that.

02:16.160 --> 02:18.580
- Quick! He's coming!
- Hide!

02:18.830 --> 02:20.790
- Quiet!
- Stop it!

02:38.350 --> 02:41.110
Children, where's Aggy?

02:56.950 --> 02:58.500
Look at you.

02:58.750 --> 03:00.790
You're all cabbagey.

03:01.040 --> 03:04.590
Oh...and you're all gravy-y.

03:04.840 --> 03:09.510
As was your intention, Nanny Whetstone
has resigned from her post.

03:09.760 --> 03:13.550
I shall go to the agency this afternoon
and hire a new nanny.

03:13.800 --> 03:18.350
You will not drive her away
as you have done with her predecessors.

03:21.770 --> 03:22.730
Papa.

03:23.650 --> 03:26.070
Can't catch me out.
That showed 'em who's boss.

03:30.490 --> 03:33.620
Three days, eight hours and 47 minutes.

03:33.870 --> 03:36.080
So that got rid of her...

03:36.330 --> 03:39.160
23 hours and 13 minutes
quicker than the last one.

03:39.410 --> 03:43.920
I think the turning point was definitely
eating the baby. Well done, Eric.

03:45.040 --> 03:47.840
Mr Brown, are you all right?

03:48.090 --> 03:49.920
I'm perfectly all right.

03:50.170 --> 03:55.510
Evangeline, could you let Cook know
that the new nanny has had to leave

03:55.720 --> 03:58.720
and I'm off to the agency
to find a new one?

04:06.230 --> 04:09.320
Good. I'll just...

04:23.710 --> 04:26.500
- Mrs Partridge?
- We're closed.

04:26.750 --> 04:29.050
- There's been a tiny hiccup.
- We're not here.

04:29.300 --> 04:31.590
- Please, let me in...
- Go away.

04:31.840 --> 04:35.260
Listen, they didn't eat the baby.
It was a chicken, actually.

04:35.510 --> 04:39.060
There's no more nannies!
You've had the lot.

04:48.400 --> 04:52.320
The person you need is Nanny McPhee.

04:52.570 --> 04:54.820
Is that you, Mrs Partridge?

04:55.870 --> 05:00.700
The person you need is Nanny McPhee.

05:00.950 --> 05:04.620
I need her to start right away.
I'm late for a vital tea dance.

05:04.870 --> 05:07.540
Nanny McPhee is not on our books.

05:07.790 --> 05:11.630
Nanny McPhee is not on anyone's books.

05:13.720 --> 05:15.430
Nanny Whetstone's gone.

05:15.680 --> 05:19.760
There's a surprise.
Hurry it up there. Spuds.

05:20.010 --> 05:24.980
Mr Brown's gone to the agency.
I said the children'll be fine with us.

05:25.230 --> 05:27.270
They won't be fine with me.

05:27.480 --> 05:30.780
I won't have them dirty blighters
in my kitchen, and that is that!

05:31.030 --> 05:34.700
I have it in writing. In writing!

05:38.370 --> 05:41.790
- Well, that's the final straw.
- Pa!

05:42.040 --> 05:44.080
There are no more nannies.

05:44.330 --> 05:47.630
None. All over, finished.

05:47.880 --> 05:51.130
I've had to cancel my appointment
and that will cause trouble.

05:51.380 --> 05:56.340
- I told them not to. It wasn't my idea.
- Don't look at me! It's not my fault.

05:56.590 --> 05:59.390
Well, you seem intent
on distressing me...

05:59.640 --> 06:02.850
Er...don't do that, darling, please.
That's my sore bit.

06:04.520 --> 06:07.650
You seem intent on distressing me,
so I'm going to distress you.

06:07.900 --> 06:11.770
You are to...to go to bed immediately.

06:12.020 --> 06:14.690
Before supper?

06:17.280 --> 06:19.370
Without supper.

06:20.570 --> 06:23.240
Did he say without supper?

06:23.450 --> 06:25.870
Never mind that.

06:26.120 --> 06:29.500
There's no more nannies.

06:29.750 --> 06:32.960
Poor him...and poor them.

06:33.210 --> 06:35.550
Poor them, my Aunt Fanny.

06:35.800 --> 06:38.550
They're the worstest,
nastiest, horriblest...

06:38.800 --> 06:42.050
It'll be snow in August
before this family's straightened out.

06:42.300 --> 06:46.310
"Dear Nanny Whetstone,
I'm so very sorry."

06:46.560 --> 06:48.980
"My children..."

06:49.230 --> 06:52.440
Eric, give it back to her!
Give it back now! Stop it!

06:52.690 --> 06:54.190
My children.

06:56.820 --> 06:59.780
Eric! Eric, that's my teddy!

07:00.030 --> 07:03.240
- Eric, stop doing this!
- Give it back!

07:05.240 --> 07:08.410
- Stop fighting!
- Oi, you lot!

07:08.660 --> 07:11.500
Quiet!

07:11.750 --> 07:16.340
You're driving your poor father
to distraction. Stop it.

07:17.470 --> 07:20.800
Lily, what's this word?

07:21.050 --> 07:24.510
Lovingly."He took her
lovingly by the hand."

07:24.760 --> 07:26.310
What's your book about, Evangeline?

07:26.560 --> 07:30.770
It's about the daughter of a nice man
who remarries after his wife dies

07:31.020 --> 07:32.770
and the stepmother's horrid to her.

07:33.020 --> 07:35.400
Why doesn't the man
stop her being horrid?

07:35.650 --> 07:38.570
Fathers all turn bad
once their wives die.

07:38.650 --> 07:40.360
They don't care any more.

07:40.610 --> 07:43.820
Simon. Yours does.

07:44.080 --> 07:45.790
No, he doesn't.

07:46.040 --> 07:50.960
Does he read to Chrissie
or play cricket with us like he used to?

07:51.210 --> 07:54.500
He doesn't even sing Loola-bye to Aggy.
We hardly see him.

07:54.750 --> 07:59.720
He loves you, Simon. You know that.
He's just had a lot on his mind since...

07:59.970 --> 08:02.340
Since Mother died.

08:09.140 --> 08:11.690
You used to be as close as anything.

08:11.940 --> 08:16.770
Not any more. All he cares about now
is getting himself a nice new wife.

08:19.280 --> 08:23.280
Well... I don't know
if that's true or not,

08:23.530 --> 08:25.910
but it might be nice
to have a new mother.

08:26.160 --> 08:29.080
Don't you know anything about the world?

08:29.330 --> 08:32.789
Whoever he marries will be vile
and treat us like slaves.

08:33.039 --> 08:36.590
- You don't know that.
- Plenty of hard evidence for it.

08:36.840 --> 08:41.799
There isn't one stepmother in there
who's even halfway decent.

08:42.049 --> 08:46.720
They're an evil breed. Anyway,
who ever likes other people's children?

08:46.970 --> 08:48.720
I like you.

08:48.970 --> 08:52.270
Yes, but you're a servant.
You're paid to like us.

08:52.520 --> 08:54.520
That doesn't count.

08:57.900 --> 09:01.150
I've got my work to be getting on with.

09:04.570 --> 09:06.570
I really am hungry, Evangeline.

09:06.820 --> 09:10.700
Could you maybe bring me
some secret toast and jam?

09:10.950 --> 09:14.290
All right, forget the jam.
Just some secret toast.

09:25.050 --> 09:28.180
Shall I plump the cushion
on Mrs Brown's chair?

09:28.430 --> 09:31.020
I know you like to plump it yourself
sometimes.

09:31.270 --> 09:35.310
Oh, no, that's...that's all right.
You plump away, Evangeline. Thank you.

09:41.940 --> 09:46.160
I was wondering if I might make
Master Sebastian a piece of toast.

09:46.410 --> 09:49.620
Yes, I should think...
Er...no, under no circumstances. No.

09:49.830 --> 09:51.700
I could do it secret-like.

09:51.910 --> 09:55.500
No, they'll hear him chewing
and then we're done for.

09:56.710 --> 09:58.210
No, they get nothing.

09:58.420 --> 10:00.250
Righto, Mr Brown.

10:03.260 --> 10:07.050
The person you need is Nanny McPhee.

10:09.260 --> 10:11.010
Nanny McPhee.

10:20.310 --> 10:22.270
No supper.

10:22.530 --> 10:25.690
Discipline. That's more like it.

10:50.930 --> 10:54.390
Now, you listen here,
you pustular tykes.

10:54.600 --> 10:57.690
You ain't allowed in this kitchen,
not now, not ever.

10:57.940 --> 10:59.600
I have it in writing.

11:00.940 --> 11:05.030
Well, dear, the agency
has closed its doors.

11:05.280 --> 11:08.530
What am I to do? Aunt Adelaide says...

11:08.780 --> 11:10.990
Your children are out
of control, Cedric.

11:11.240 --> 11:13.450
And there was that thing she said...

11:13.530 --> 11:16.250
about their needing a
female influence. I...

11:17.370 --> 11:20.080
You know what she's like.
She'll stop the allowance

11:20.330 --> 11:25.300
unless I marry again and give them
a new mother within the month.

11:25.550 --> 11:30.800
A month. I mean, it's unbearable.
But l... I had to... I had to promise.

11:33.350 --> 11:38.430
Remember we talked about
what would happen without her money.

11:38.680 --> 11:40.980
The bank will take the house.

11:41.230 --> 11:45.440
There'll be debtors' prison for me,
workhouse for the older children.

11:45.690 --> 11:48.860
Goodness only knows
what'll happen to little Chrissie.

11:49.110 --> 11:51.200
And as for Aggy...

11:51.450 --> 11:53.740
it's unimaginable.

12:01.370 --> 12:05.380
Where are you? You mewling half-bakes!

12:05.630 --> 12:08.130
I'm ready for you. And I'm hard!

12:15.930 --> 12:17.930
This is fun!

12:19.100 --> 12:20.430
We got Cook!

12:20.680 --> 12:25.110
The person you need is Nanny McPhee.

12:25.360 --> 12:28.190
Jump!

12:28.440 --> 12:31.200
Eric, you're not making another bomb,
are you?

12:33.820 --> 12:37.030
McPhee...

12:37.280 --> 12:39.450
Jump!

12:39.700 --> 12:42.040
- Oh!
- Jump!

12:44.380 --> 12:49.710
- They're in the kitchen.
- No! No! You took them down for toast!

12:49.960 --> 12:52.760
I never did!
You sent them to bed with no dinner.

12:53.010 --> 12:54.390
- That's what done it!
- Don't tell...

13:04.190 --> 13:05.690
- I'll, er...
- Why don't you...?

13:05.940 --> 13:07.570
- I'll go.
- No, I'd better...

13:07.820 --> 13:10.610
- Well, no, I can...
- You, erm... I'll...

13:10.860 --> 13:14.660
- I'll be off, then.
- Yes, you... I'll just...

13:44.940 --> 13:48.810
Good evening, Mr Brown.
I am Nanny McPhee.

13:50.360 --> 13:53.570
Oh, you're... Er...of course.

13:53.820 --> 13:56.070
Good heavens. I suppose the agency...

13:56.320 --> 14:00.660
I do not belong to any agency, Mr Brown.
I am a government nanny.

14:00.910 --> 14:03.700
A government nanny? How...

14:05.250 --> 14:06.420
.. unusual.

14:06.670 --> 14:08.250
May I come in?

14:08.500 --> 14:11.840
Yes, by all means, do...do come in.

14:16.300 --> 14:20.430
I understand you have
extremely ill-behaved children.

14:20.680 --> 14:24.480
No. No, no. No.
No... Good grief, what a suggestion.

14:27.140 --> 14:29.150
- Playful.
- Shut up!

14:29.400 --> 14:31.320
What are your main concerns?

14:31.570 --> 14:32.690
Concerns?

14:32.940 --> 14:35.740
Mm. Do they go to bed when they're told?

14:35.990 --> 14:38.410
Well, no, not, er... No.

14:38.660 --> 14:42.660
- Do they get up when they're told?
- Er...well, no, not exactly.

14:42.910 --> 14:46.500
- Get dressed when they're told?
- Now, that's a good question.

14:46.750 --> 14:51.590
- Do they say "please" and "thank you"?
- In what context?

14:51.840 --> 14:55.300
That will do to be going on with.

14:55.550 --> 14:59.390
Your children need me.

14:59.640 --> 15:03.430
I'll go and make sure everything's
in order before I introduce you.

15:03.680 --> 15:06.480
I shall introduce myself.

15:06.730 --> 15:10.100
Please, Mr Brown,
go back to your newspaper.

15:31.790 --> 15:33.340
Oh, look.

15:35.550 --> 15:38.220
The door's open and
there's nobody there.

15:41.640 --> 15:43.600
I am here.

15:43.850 --> 15:46.220
I am Nanny McPhee.

15:46.470 --> 15:49.140
Oh, did...did somebody speak?

15:49.350 --> 15:53.400
- I didn't hear anything.
- That's because nobody's there.

15:56.570 --> 15:59.990
Then listen carefully
and try to hear this.

16:00.240 --> 16:03.490
Stop what you are doing,
put the kitchen to rights

16:03.740 --> 16:05.490
and go upstairs to bed.

16:09.370 --> 16:13.130
- Did you hear what I said?
- I've just had an idea.

16:13.380 --> 16:17.760
Why don't we play here
in the kitchen all night long?

16:18.010 --> 16:20.220
Let's, let's!

16:22.800 --> 16:26.600
- Excellent notion.
- Tomatoes!

16:26.850 --> 16:30.480
Jump! Jump, jump! Jump!

16:30.730 --> 16:34.480
Jump, jump, jump, jump!

16:34.730 --> 16:37.570
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!

16:37.820 --> 16:40.110
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!

16:40.360 --> 16:43.280
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump...jump...

16:43.530 --> 16:46.240
jump.

17:03.880 --> 17:05.640
Government nanny?

17:08.930 --> 17:10.140
What's she done?

17:10.390 --> 17:14.440
- She's done something to us!
- They went in the pot!

17:14.690 --> 17:16.150
I can't stop!

17:16.400 --> 17:17.940
She banged her stick!

17:18.190 --> 17:20.150
I'm going to be sick!

17:24.950 --> 17:28.410
- It must be magic!
- What's happening?

17:32.870 --> 17:35.370
- Please, Simon, let's stop!
- We've got to stop!

17:35.620 --> 17:38.170
- Let's stop!
- Let's stop!

17:41.710 --> 17:44.380
- Well, stop if you want, then!
- We can't!

17:44.630 --> 17:45.840
It's her fault!

17:46.090 --> 17:47.930
It started when she banged the stick!

17:48.180 --> 17:51.720
- I can't stop!
- Slow down!

17:52.390 --> 17:53.770
Simon!

17:54.020 --> 17:57.480
Come on, whoever you are!
Let's stop this and go to bed!

17:59.440 --> 18:02.230
- Say "please".
- I never say "please".

18:02.490 --> 18:03.530
Very well.

18:03.780 --> 18:06.110
- Please!
- Please!

18:06.360 --> 18:09.120
- Don't touch Aggy!
- Wait!

18:09.330 --> 18:11.040
Say it!

18:11.290 --> 18:14.460
Actually, Simon, would you,
because this baby's gonna blow!

18:14.710 --> 18:18.670
- And Aggy's gonna go in the stockpot!
- Put her back, Chrissie!

18:20.000 --> 18:22.380
Oh, for goodness' sake! Please, then!

18:24.970 --> 18:28.050
Take Aggy off me!

18:28.300 --> 18:31.180
Please, Nanny McPhee.

18:33.220 --> 18:34.600
Chrissie, don't!

18:35.850 --> 18:39.150
- Say it!
- Take Aggy out!

18:39.400 --> 18:42.070
- No, Lily!
- Say it!

18:42.320 --> 18:43.980
Simon!

18:44.240 --> 18:47.990
I can't stop myself!

18:48.240 --> 18:50.620
Please, Nanny McPhee.

18:51.580 --> 18:53.910
I'm going to jump!

18:54.160 --> 18:55.500
Too late!

19:10.140 --> 19:12.260
Blimey.

19:12.510 --> 19:14.600
Up to bed, please.

19:27.530 --> 19:30.780
Goodnight, Mrs Blatherwick.
Goodnight, Evangeline.

19:31.030 --> 19:33.370
Goodnight, Nanny McPhee.

19:34.490 --> 19:38.710
When Mr Brown said no dinner,
I thought they'd be down in a trice.

19:38.960 --> 19:40.580
They've been ever so quiet.

19:40.830 --> 19:44.710
Don't you fret.
They don't dare come in this kitchen.

19:44.960 --> 19:47.550
I have it in writing.

19:51.680 --> 19:53.470
Be careful, Aggy.

19:53.720 --> 19:55.180
It's Mama's rattle,

19:55.260 --> 19:58.600
and it's the only thing
we've got of hers.

20:01.440 --> 20:04.520
- What on earth are you doing?
- Getting ready for bed.

20:04.770 --> 20:08.780
- What she told us to do.
- Since when did we do what we're told?

20:08.990 --> 20:11.820
Since we nearly got Cook blown up
and Aggy boiled.

20:13.780 --> 20:18.660
May I just remind you of something?
We got rid of the last 17 nannies.

20:18.870 --> 20:21.080
We're getting rid of this one too.

20:23.750 --> 20:26.050
Fine! Be brave, then!

20:26.300 --> 20:31.300
Yes, well, I nearly got blown up!
And anyway, l...

20:37.810 --> 20:39.180
Hm.

20:56.530 --> 21:00.500
You must feel at such a disadvantage,
Nanny McPhee.

21:00.750 --> 21:01.910
In what way?

21:02.160 --> 21:05.040
We know your name
but you don't know ours.

21:07.960 --> 21:10.840
Pleased to meet you.
I'm Oglington Fartworthy.

21:19.430 --> 21:22.440
How do you do?

21:24.310 --> 21:26.650
That's F-A-R-T.

21:26.900 --> 21:30.610
Fartworthy.

21:32.530 --> 21:35.200
Booger McHorsefanny.

21:35.450 --> 21:37.660
Knickers O'Muffin.

21:37.870 --> 21:39.120
Sandra.

21:39.370 --> 21:40.410
Bum.

21:40.660 --> 21:42.830
I'm Bum!

21:43.080 --> 21:44.830
Oh. Bosoms.

21:48.540 --> 21:49.630
Bum.

21:49.880 --> 21:54.220
You can't be Bum, Aggy.
Sebastian's Bum. You're Poop.

21:54.470 --> 21:55.760
Poop Bum.

21:56.010 --> 21:58.100
You can't be Poop and Bum.

22:18.780 --> 22:20.910
Goodnight, Agatha.

22:28.380 --> 22:30.840
Goodnight, Sebastian.

22:31.050 --> 22:33.130
Goodnight, Tora.

22:33.380 --> 22:35.420
Goodnight, Christianna.

22:37.010 --> 22:38.970
Goodnight, Lily.

22:39.220 --> 22:41.100
Goodnight, Eric.

22:44.600 --> 22:46.690
Goodnight, Simon.

22:52.440 --> 22:56.860
There is something you should understand
about the way I work.

22:57.110 --> 23:01.490
When you need me but do not want me,
then I must stay.

23:01.740 --> 23:07.870
When you want me but no longer need me,
then I have to go.

23:12.290 --> 23:15.210
It's rather sad,
really, but there it is.

23:16.380 --> 23:19.260
We will never want you.

23:20.760 --> 23:22.970
Then I will never go.

23:28.020 --> 23:30.900
Goodnight, children.

23:34.230 --> 23:37.740
How did she know our names?
No one ever knows our names.

23:37.990 --> 23:39.780
- Magic.
- Witchcraft.

23:40.030 --> 23:43.870
It doesn't matter.
We're getting rid of her tomorrow.

23:52.840 --> 23:57.720
What? Wha... What? What?

23:57.970 --> 23:59.930
I did knock.

24:00.180 --> 24:03.930
Of course. You weren't just
creeping up on me. What a suggestion.

24:04.180 --> 24:07.180
The children are
all in bed and asleep.

24:07.270 --> 24:08.180
Good. Really?

24:08.430 --> 24:10.140
Hm.

24:11.400 --> 24:14.770
- Good grief.
- I shall see myself to my room.

24:15.020 --> 24:16.860
Goodnight, Mr Brown.

24:21.860 --> 24:23.780
No, wait.

24:25.080 --> 24:28.120
What do you... I mean, how...
What are your terms?

24:29.830 --> 24:32.960
Your children require five lessons.

24:33.210 --> 24:37.300
Lesson one, to go to bed
when they're told, is complete.

24:37.550 --> 24:41.840
As for my terms,
I take Sunday afternoons off.

24:42.970 --> 24:45.300
Goodnight.

24:47.260 --> 24:48.560
Interesting.

25:03.860 --> 25:05.700
Time to get up.

25:06.910 --> 25:09.040
No.

25:11.910 --> 25:15.380
Hm. I shall give you
half an hour to be up,

25:15.630 --> 25:19.130
washed, dressed, teeth
cleaned, beds made

25:19.380 --> 25:20.760
and out into the garden...

25:20.880 --> 25:23.090
for healthful fresh
air before breakfast.

25:23.340 --> 25:28.010
Lessons start at nine...sharp.

25:30.430 --> 25:34.730
I don't know about you lot,
but I want to stay in bed.

25:34.980 --> 25:38.610
Sebastian, run the thermometer
under the hot tap.

25:38.860 --> 25:42.490
Chrissie, chalk. Eric,
crayons. Lily, pepper.

25:42.740 --> 25:45.780
How do you know
she won't do something horrid to us?

25:46.030 --> 25:47.490
I worked it out.

25:47.740 --> 25:52.000
She's a trained hypnotist.
That's how she made us do those things.

25:52.250 --> 25:55.120
Don't look directly at her
and she can't hypnotise us.

25:56.880 --> 25:58.090
- Morning, Mr Brown.
- Morning.

25:58.340 --> 26:01.090
I'm off to work early.
We're busy at the mortuary.

26:01.340 --> 26:03.630
Some bout of influenza at Archway...

26:03.760 --> 26:06.720
is carrying off all the
old folks... Ah-ah-ah!

26:06.970 --> 26:10.260
Still, what's bad for them
is good for us.

26:10.510 --> 26:12.310
Poor things.

26:12.560 --> 26:15.230
Well, I know. That, too. Of course.

26:18.400 --> 26:21.900
Odd. She normally says,
"Have a nice day,"

26:22.150 --> 26:25.240
or "Don't forget your
jacket" if it's cold out.

26:25.490 --> 26:28.530
Very odd. Most peculiar.

26:30.660 --> 26:33.080
Hm.

26:34.210 --> 26:37.790
- I did knock.
- Did you? I didn't hear.

26:38.040 --> 26:39.630
I was talking to...

26:42.300 --> 26:44.130
Never mind.

26:44.380 --> 26:47.300
I believe the children
will be staying in bed today.

26:47.550 --> 26:50.350
The children? What, all day?
Are they ill? What's wrong?

26:50.600 --> 26:54.060
Nothing. I know precisely what to do.
Please leave it to me.

26:54.310 --> 26:56.600
You managed them splendidly last night.

26:56.850 --> 26:58.560
If they are under the weather,

26:58.810 --> 27:01.980
give them what they want,
ice-cream and jelly and suchlike.

27:02.230 --> 27:05.400
My late wife was very particular.
If ever they were ill,

27:05.650 --> 27:08.110
she used to wait on
them hand and foot...

27:08.240 --> 27:10.160
even if they weren't ill at all.

27:10.410 --> 27:14.750
I shall be sure to give them
exactly what they need.

27:15.000 --> 27:19.540
Excellent. Excellent.
Well, I'll just be off to work, then.

27:31.140 --> 27:32.810
She's coming!

27:33.060 --> 27:36.020
Remember, everyone,
don't look in her eyes.

27:40.560 --> 27:41.860
Dear me.

27:42.110 --> 27:46.240
We can't get up. We're ill.

27:46.490 --> 27:48.610
Colds in our doses.

27:48.860 --> 27:50.360
And kemperakurk.

27:50.610 --> 27:53.200
We think it bight be the beasles.

27:53.450 --> 27:54.950
Got measig.

27:55.200 --> 27:57.790
Good heavens.

27:58.040 --> 28:01.210
Then there is of course
no question of your getting up.

28:01.460 --> 28:06.960
I'm very sorry to have to tell you all
that you'll have to stay in bed.

28:11.010 --> 28:12.140
Hm.

28:31.360 --> 28:34.370
- Ah.
- I don't feel well.

28:34.620 --> 28:39.250
- I think I've got a temperature.
- Don't be daft.

28:41.830 --> 28:43.670
Simon, I can't get up.

28:43.920 --> 28:46.960
- You must have looked at her, then.
- I did not look.

28:47.210 --> 28:51.840
I was under the covers the whole time,
Simon. I can't get up either.

28:52.090 --> 28:54.970
- I can't get up!
- I'm stuck like glue!

28:55.220 --> 28:56.810
I'm stuck, too!

28:58.770 --> 29:02.810
Hypnosis, eh? Bang goes that theory.

29:07.110 --> 29:08.820
Good morning.

29:17.370 --> 29:20.040
Morning, Mr B!

29:20.250 --> 29:22.710
Good morning, Mr Jowls, Mr Wheen.

29:22.960 --> 29:26.630
- Thought we'd get you that time.
- No, not this time.

29:26.880 --> 29:31.260
- Nice tea dance, Mr B?
- Ooh, lovely, I shouldn't wonder.

29:31.510 --> 29:34.800
No. I didn't even get there. Disaster.
Children, you know.

29:35.050 --> 29:37.640
- We do know.
- We've said it before.

29:37.890 --> 29:41.230
It's not funerals
you should be in the business of.

29:41.480 --> 29:43.770
It's christenings.

29:52.450 --> 29:56.620
Good morning.
Just excuse me a moment, would you?

29:56.870 --> 29:59.160
Cedric,
let me not beat about the bush.

29:59.410 --> 30:01.040
Your children are out of control.

30:01.290 --> 30:04.750
You need a wife
and your children need a mother.

30:05.000 --> 30:08.420
If you do not remarry by
the end of the month,

30:08.540 --> 30:10.590
steps will have to be taken.

30:10.840 --> 30:13.800
Oh, dear. Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.

30:15.720 --> 30:18.470
What's your wife like?

30:18.720 --> 30:23.270
Never mind. Less than a month to go.
There's nothing for it.

30:23.520 --> 30:27.610
It'll have to be that woman...
the dreadful one.

30:28.860 --> 30:33.190
Mr Jowls, do you recollect
that...enthusiastic lady?

30:33.440 --> 30:38.030
Mrs Swiftly, was it? Or was it
Mrs Thadius something last year?

30:38.280 --> 30:41.200
- Mrs Thadius Quickly?
- Oh, don't.

30:41.450 --> 30:46.290
"Oh, Mr Brown, you are a saint. You have
a lovely look of kindness about you."

30:46.540 --> 30:52.090
What I wouldn't give for a man like you,
Mr Brown, in my hour of need.

30:53.630 --> 30:55.550
- That one?
- Yes, that one.

30:55.800 --> 30:58.300
We buried Mr Quickly last autumn.
Poor devil.

30:58.550 --> 31:02.180
- He was happy to go.
- He was her third.

31:02.430 --> 31:06.190
You don't happen to know
if... if she ever...ever, erm...

31:06.440 --> 31:08.900
remarried? You know, number four?

31:09.150 --> 31:11.400
Mr Brown, you're not
thinking what I think...

31:11.520 --> 31:13.280
you're thinking, are you, Mr Brown?

31:14.740 --> 31:17.280
Good grief, no! No, no. No. No.

31:17.530 --> 31:21.580
No. No, no... no. What
a thought. No. No.

31:24.410 --> 31:26.750
What's that?

31:27.000 --> 31:30.460
Measle medicine,
to be administered once an hour.

31:30.710 --> 31:33.170
Actually, I'm not sure it is measles.

31:33.420 --> 31:36.380
How can it be anything other?

31:36.630 --> 31:39.300
The chalky-white faces, the livid spots,

31:39.550 --> 31:43.010
the temperatures of 120 degrees.

31:43.260 --> 31:46.430
I've seen it time and again. Measles.

31:47.940 --> 31:49.980
Definitely.

31:57.570 --> 32:01.990
- Open.
- Simon, don't!

32:02.240 --> 32:04.540
I'm not taking that.

32:04.790 --> 32:07.370
Then you will not get any better.

32:07.620 --> 32:09.330
Believe me.

32:09.580 --> 32:11.960
It's moving!

32:13.420 --> 32:15.800
Open wide.

32:17.970 --> 32:19.590
Wider.

32:36.230 --> 32:38.530
Simon, spit it out!

32:38.780 --> 32:41.200
You'll have to swallow
it sooner or later,

32:41.280 --> 32:43.240
so I suggest you get it over with.

32:49.410 --> 32:52.880
Very good. Who's next?

32:54.090 --> 32:55.420
"Took..."

32:55.670 --> 32:57.300
"He..."

32:57.550 --> 33:00.420
"He took her lovingly..."

33:00.670 --> 33:05.510
"He took her lovingly
by the...the hand."

33:05.760 --> 33:10.560
Oh! Nanny McPhee, you startled me.

33:10.810 --> 33:12.230
It was that quiet.

33:12.480 --> 33:16.820
I just got to practising my sounds.
Lily's teaching me to read.

33:17.070 --> 33:18.360
That is good.

33:18.610 --> 33:22.780
They're all good... underneath it all.

33:24.160 --> 33:28.620
- A favourite of yours?
- Don't know.

33:28.870 --> 33:30.910
I haven't finished it yet.

33:31.160 --> 33:34.460
The stepmother's a
bit of a horror, though.

33:34.580 --> 33:35.330
Oh, indeed.

33:35.580 --> 33:38.090
It's a pity stories
aren't about real people.

33:38.340 --> 33:42.300
This one seems a farm girl,
but I'll bet a pound to a penny

33:42.550 --> 33:46.350
he finds out she's
really an educated lady.

33:46.600 --> 33:48.890
And then he falls for her.

33:49.140 --> 33:51.230
You must read it and find out.

33:51.480 --> 33:54.350
He wouldn't love her
if she couldn't read.

33:54.600 --> 33:57.770
He'd think her stupid

33:58.020 --> 34:02.070
and worthless and beneath him.

34:02.320 --> 34:03.400
Hm.

34:18.750 --> 34:23.130
Buttered spuds for lunch
with boiled beef, apple pie and custard.

34:23.380 --> 34:25.630
Hm.

34:27.300 --> 34:31.560
I think the children will be requiring
something a little more...

34:31.810 --> 34:33.679
austere today.

34:33.929 --> 34:35.600
'Orse what?

34:35.850 --> 34:39.730
The children are not quite themselves,
Mrs Blatherwick.

34:39.980 --> 34:42.030
God! That means jellies and ice-cream,

34:42.150 --> 34:44.400
raspberry cordial and
God knows what else.

34:44.650 --> 34:47.199
Well, I'd better get cracking, then.

34:47.449 --> 34:49.580
Evangeline!

34:49.830 --> 34:52.040
Where is that lump?

34:52.290 --> 34:53.580
It'll be snow in August...

34:53.659 --> 34:55.790
before that one's there
when you need her.

34:56.040 --> 35:00.880
Calm yourself, Mrs Blatherwick.
I'm in charge today.

35:01.130 --> 35:05.470
I understand that you were once
in the armed forces.

35:08.010 --> 35:12.100
I was that. Cooked at a training camp
in Gloucestershire.

35:12.350 --> 35:14.480
Kept those boys strong, I did.

35:14.730 --> 35:20.310
I'm sure you did. Perhaps a broth
of some sort for the children.

35:20.560 --> 35:22.650
You must be an expert.

35:22.900 --> 35:25.740
Best thin potato gruel with peelings in?

35:25.990 --> 35:28.530
That always got 'em groaning
but kept 'em strong.

35:28.780 --> 35:30.870
Are you well supplied with peelings?

35:36.370 --> 35:38.460
These'll do. Only a day old.

35:44.840 --> 35:48.260
A bit of gristle for
flavour. Ever so tasty.

35:50.390 --> 35:51.760
Get that down you.

35:51.890 --> 35:55.270
There's a lot of goodness
in a turkey neck.

35:55.520 --> 35:57.640
That'll put the hairs
back on your chest.

35:57.890 --> 35:59.150
Smell that.

35:59.230 --> 36:04.230
That is the smell that
forged this empire.

36:04.440 --> 36:08.740
That pong is the pong of conquerors.

36:08.990 --> 36:12.120
All right, men. As you were.

36:13.870 --> 36:16.700
They actually are starving us.

36:16.950 --> 36:20.210
I wonder how long it will
take for us all to die.

36:36.390 --> 36:39.230
Quickly...

36:39.440 --> 36:42.860
Quickly, Quickly, Quickly...

36:43.060 --> 36:45.650
Mrs Selma Quickly.

36:51.740 --> 36:54.830
Have you lazy lot been in bed all day?

36:55.030 --> 36:56.870
Evangeline.

36:57.120 --> 36:59.290
You've been doing measles, haven't you?

36:59.540 --> 37:01.790
The situation's very simple, Evangeline.

37:02.040 --> 37:05.210
The nanny, who in my opinion is a witch,

37:05.460 --> 37:08.170
made us ill and fed
us boiled-down toads.

37:08.420 --> 37:12.300
Nanny McPhee is not a witch, Eric.
You're very naughty to say so.

37:12.550 --> 37:14.760
I'm sure she knew what she was doing.

37:15.010 --> 37:18.720
- She must be fully trained.
- Yes, but as what?

37:18.970 --> 37:21.520
I'm unbelievably hungry, Evangeline.

37:21.770 --> 37:26.270
Can you please get us
something decent to eat?

37:26.520 --> 37:28.820
Did you just say "please"?

37:29.070 --> 37:31.200
Please, please, Evangeline!

37:33.030 --> 37:36.490
Well, children,
I hear you've been in bed all day

37:36.740 --> 37:38.330
but that you're better now.

37:38.580 --> 37:40.790
It wasn't our fault.

37:41.040 --> 37:44.960
I'm sure it wasn't anybody's fault.
You can't help it if you're ill.

37:45.210 --> 37:47.000
But you're better now.

37:59.810 --> 38:01.180
- Papa?
- Yes, Chrissie?

38:01.430 --> 38:04.560
Now that we're better, can we get up?

38:04.810 --> 38:07.770
Can we get up, please?

38:17.410 --> 38:19.580
Of course you can.

38:19.830 --> 38:21.450
Read to us.

38:21.700 --> 38:25.000
I, erm... I have my
letter-writing to do. I...

38:26.710 --> 38:30.920
I'll read to you tomorrow.
Goodnight, my dears.

38:36.680 --> 38:37.720
Evangeline,

38:37.970 --> 38:41.850
please ask Cook to make the children
scrambled eggs on toast.

38:42.100 --> 38:44.980
I'm sure they'd like supper
now they're feeling better.

38:45.230 --> 38:48.360
I'll do it myself, Nanny McPhee.

38:56.490 --> 38:58.530
Didn't she have two bumpy things?

38:58.780 --> 39:00.830
The word is "wart".

39:01.080 --> 39:04.660
Traditionally associated with witches,
as it happens.

39:04.870 --> 39:07.250
Well, one of 'em's gone.

39:18.970 --> 39:20.970
I did knock.

39:21.220 --> 39:23.180
Of course you did.

39:23.430 --> 39:27.440
Lesson two, to get up when they're told,
is complete.

39:27.690 --> 39:29.770
Of course. Very good. Thank you.

39:30.020 --> 39:32.110
Goodnight, Mr Brown.

39:33.650 --> 39:36.150
- Nanny McPhee...
- Yes, Mr Brown?

39:36.400 --> 39:38.660
Didn't you used to have two...

39:40.780 --> 39:43.160
w...w...?

39:46.250 --> 39:49.250
Never mind. It's, er...
it's my imagination.

39:58.800 --> 40:01.550
There was a telegram, Mr Brown.

40:09.980 --> 40:12.310
Oh, my... Oh, my goodness.

40:15.780 --> 40:17.780
- Ah, Nanny McPhee.
- Pa!

40:18.030 --> 40:21.700
Good, good, good.
All right, I have an announcement.

40:21.950 --> 40:23.370
Yes...

40:23.580 --> 40:26.660
Your Great-Aunt Adelaide
is coming for tea today.

40:28.500 --> 40:31.210
- No!
- Aunt Adelaide is vile and vicious.

40:31.420 --> 40:32.500
She's blind as a bat.

40:32.630 --> 40:34.880
And we are convalescing,
for heaven's sake!

40:35.090 --> 40:37.170
That's enough. I don't want to hear...

40:37.300 --> 40:39.550
anything bad about her.
She pays the rent.

40:39.760 --> 40:43.220
- She scares me.
- She's only coming for tea.

40:43.430 --> 40:45.770
You'll all put your best clothes on

40:45.970 --> 40:48.480
and Nanny McPhee will keep you in order.

40:48.730 --> 40:53.020
I shall do my best, sir,
considering that today is Sunday

40:53.270 --> 40:55.360
and I am off duty this afternoon.

40:55.610 --> 40:57.280
Off duty?

40:59.650 --> 41:02.110
You're off duty when...?

41:02.370 --> 41:05.280
You can't be off duty.
I need you. They need you.

41:05.530 --> 41:07.450
I shall be leaving at noon.

41:07.700 --> 41:10.370
Thereafter, I'm sure
the children will do...

41:10.460 --> 41:13.210
exactly as they're told.
Won't you, children?

41:14.960 --> 41:18.050
Listen to this, dear.
Aunt Adelaide says,

41:18.300 --> 41:20.800
"l am coming with the express intention

41:21.050 --> 41:24.010
of easing your financial burden."

41:24.260 --> 41:28.350
Maybe she's thought the better
of my having to remarry.

41:28.600 --> 41:31.350
Perhaps I won't have
to go through with it.

41:48.290 --> 41:51.620
I hate my best clothes.
They're itchy.

41:51.870 --> 41:53.870
Well, we promised, so that's that.

41:55.000 --> 41:58.170
Tora's right.
We should do exactly as we're told.

41:58.420 --> 42:02.510
We've been told to put
our best clothes on, haven't we? Right.

42:02.760 --> 42:07.850
Well, I'm going to put
my best clothes on...the pig.

42:08.100 --> 42:09.350
Simon, no.

42:09.600 --> 42:13.190
- Yeah, the pig!
- Oh, please, don't!

42:20.690 --> 42:23.900
- Aunt Adelaide, welcome back.
- Where are you?

42:24.160 --> 42:27.410
- Here I am, Aunt Adelaide.
- Oh! Don't crowd me so.

42:27.660 --> 42:31.790
You're looking very peely-wally.
Where's my tea? I must have tea.

42:32.040 --> 42:33.660
Of course. This way. At once.

42:35.370 --> 42:36.830
I smell damp.

42:37.040 --> 42:40.760
No, no... At least not noticeably.

42:41.010 --> 42:43.510
Damp in the house.
Hence your pallid complexion.

42:43.760 --> 42:44.720
Lovely hat.

42:44.970 --> 42:48.760
A gift from the Duchess of Kent.
She has taste.

42:49.010 --> 42:52.020
I've always hated this room.

42:52.270 --> 42:53.770
- Milk?
- Certainly not.

42:54.020 --> 42:56.310
Filthy stuff. Most unhealthy.

42:56.560 --> 42:58.860
- Sugar?
- Six, if you please.

42:59.110 --> 43:00.610
Six.

43:00.860 --> 43:05.910
Let me not beat about the bush, Cedric.
You have too many children.

43:06.160 --> 43:08.530
- Ah, that.
- Don't interrupt.

43:08.780 --> 43:14.040
Your wife, my poor, weak-minded niece,
had no sense of proportion.

43:14.290 --> 43:19.380
However, I know where my duties lie.
I gave her my word that I would help.

43:19.630 --> 43:22.760
As you know, Cedric, my word is my law.

43:22.960 --> 43:25.380
I now propose to help you further.

43:25.630 --> 43:28.720
Oh, thank you, Aunt
Adelaide. Thank you.

43:28.840 --> 43:30.720
Don't interrupt. Sit down.

43:30.970 --> 43:33.560
This is my proposal.

43:33.810 --> 43:37.440
I shall relieve you of
one of your children...

43:38.560 --> 43:41.520
and give it a home with
me at Stitch Manor.

43:47.030 --> 43:50.160
It will require sacrifice on my part.
I realise that.

43:50.410 --> 43:56.330
But as my sainted father always said,
"Duty, Adelaide, always duty."

43:56.580 --> 44:00.130
- You mustn't. I can't possibly...
- Thank me enough. I know.

44:00.380 --> 44:04.090
You must feel quite overwhelmed
by the benefits of such a plan.

44:04.340 --> 44:05.970
Your fortunate daughter,

44:06.170 --> 44:09.760
for it must be a girl
and not one of those other things,

44:10.010 --> 44:13.890
will receive private tuition
in literature, history, deportment

44:14.140 --> 44:17.390
and above all, elocution.

44:17.640 --> 44:22.980
If there's one thing I won't stand for,
it's loose vowels.

44:24.440 --> 44:28.740
What did Papa say? He must have
told her not to even think of it.

44:28.990 --> 44:31.410
He didn't say anything.

44:34.990 --> 44:38.330
Come on. Let's find the others.

44:38.540 --> 44:42.130
I must be frank.
There is no question of your taking...

44:42.380 --> 44:45.670
Hush now! I'm used to
taking responsibility...

44:45.800 --> 44:47.760
for other people's mistakes.

44:48.010 --> 44:52.600
Now, where is the bulk
of your offspring?

44:59.060 --> 45:03.020
Ah. Here we are.

45:08.400 --> 45:11.610
- It was a bee. A big bee. Erm...
- Good heavens!

45:13.780 --> 45:15.870
Gone now. Phew.

45:16.080 --> 45:19.250
- Hm.
- You're not well, Cedric.

45:19.500 --> 45:22.880
The sooner you find a
good wife, the better.

45:23.130 --> 45:26.920
This'll put her off
wanting any of you girls.

45:27.170 --> 45:30.050
Speak up, girl!

45:30.300 --> 45:34.010
Oh! What an unfortunate face.

45:34.260 --> 45:37.220
All those bristles.

45:37.470 --> 45:40.770
It might be very hard
to get her decently betrothed.

45:43.310 --> 45:45.730
Do you not have a more comely girl?

45:51.650 --> 45:55.030
Perhaps round the front of the house.

45:58.790 --> 46:02.250
Chrissie, hurry up!

46:04.710 --> 46:07.210
Tie it, Chrissie.

46:07.460 --> 46:10.380
Eric, stop her!

46:10.630 --> 46:12.550
- Chrissie, stop! She'll see you!
- Papa!

46:12.800 --> 46:16.050
Cedric, I had no idea
that you had produced such a...

46:16.300 --> 46:19.770
such an unattractive batch of females.

46:20.020 --> 46:23.890
I shall leave directly. Get my hat.

46:24.150 --> 46:26.730
Your hat? So soon?

46:26.980 --> 46:29.860
- Really? No, you can't... I'll get it.
- Hewitt!

46:32.700 --> 46:34.240
No!

46:38.870 --> 46:42.790
Oh, yes. You'll do perfectly.

46:43.040 --> 46:47.920
A little timid, perhaps,
but we'll soon knock that out of you.

46:48.170 --> 46:51.380
Come on, come on. It
can't do any harm to try.

46:51.630 --> 46:54.430
I can't find your... What are you doing?

46:54.680 --> 46:56.970
- This is the chosen one. Get her ready.
- Papa, help!

46:57.220 --> 46:59.010
Chrissie? You're not listen...

46:59.100 --> 47:01.310
Shut up, Cedric, and do as you're told!

47:01.560 --> 47:04.810
Nanny McPhee, we need you.

47:05.060 --> 47:10.650
Nanny McPhee, please, we need you.

47:10.900 --> 47:14.860
Where is my hat?

47:17.280 --> 47:18.660
Hide!

47:24.580 --> 47:26.500
My hat!

47:26.750 --> 47:29.920
How dare you!

47:39.600 --> 47:43.810
- Oh, my, what a merry game.
- Yoo-hoo!

47:44.060 --> 47:46.600
My, my, what a pretty girl you are.

47:54.150 --> 47:56.650
Oh, this is the girl for me.

47:58.200 --> 47:59.700
Run.

47:59.950 --> 48:03.160
Such poise, such gaiety.

48:03.410 --> 48:06.410
- Ah, there you are, staff.
- Yes, madam.

48:06.660 --> 48:10.710
I'm taking this child
with me. Get her ready.

48:17.840 --> 48:19.300
Very well, madam.

48:19.550 --> 48:21.890
Sherry time.

48:24.640 --> 48:28.640
Do not forget that someone
has to go with your great-aunt

48:28.890 --> 48:31.360
and it cannot be the donkey, can it?

48:41.700 --> 48:44.910
Well, I'm the eldest girl. I'll go.

48:45.160 --> 48:50.120
No. I've always known
I was destined for tragedy. I'll go.

48:50.370 --> 48:52.170
Aggy go.

48:52.420 --> 48:55.960
Don't be silly, Aggy.
You're not even a whole girl yet.

48:57.170 --> 49:00.260
No. She wanted me. I'll go.

49:00.510 --> 49:02.600
You can't all go.

49:13.980 --> 49:16.730
Well, I am entirely satisfied.

49:16.980 --> 49:21.490
I will keep my word, Cedric,
if you will keep yours.

49:21.740 --> 49:25.370
You must give those children a mother
before the month is out.

49:25.620 --> 49:26.990
No.

49:28.910 --> 49:30.120
What?

49:30.370 --> 49:34.630
You cannot order me around. And you
certainly can't take any of my children.

49:34.880 --> 49:36.420
l...

49:36.670 --> 49:40.380
Your carriage awaits, madam.

49:40.630 --> 49:42.680
Is the chosen one seated?

49:42.930 --> 49:46.010
- lndeed she is.
- Good.

49:46.260 --> 49:49.850
- All is prepared.
- Which chosen one? What's prepared?

49:50.100 --> 49:52.850
Cedric, in view of this afternoon's
happy outcome,

49:53.100 --> 49:56.730
I am willing to overlook
that last unattractive outburst.

49:56.980 --> 49:59.400
- Nanny McPhee.
- Off we go, Hewitt.

49:59.650 --> 50:02.490
- What have you done?
- I have done nothing, sir.

50:02.740 --> 50:05.200
The children have decided
amongst themselves.

50:05.450 --> 50:07.580
Decided what? What do you mean?

50:07.830 --> 50:09.830
There you are, dear.

50:10.080 --> 50:13.250
Not little Chrissie.

50:14.420 --> 50:16.040
Chrissie!

50:19.550 --> 50:20.920
Chrissie!

50:22.220 --> 50:23.340
Yah!

50:25.090 --> 50:26.470
Chrissie!

50:31.270 --> 50:34.230
Now, then, you'd better
tell me your name, little girl.

50:38.320 --> 50:39.280
Christianna!

50:39.360 --> 50:42.280
Don't be shy, my dear.
What is your name?

50:46.370 --> 50:49.080
Sit up straight and tell me your name.

50:51.450 --> 50:53.500
No!

50:54.830 --> 50:56.750
- Christianna!
- Papa!

50:57.000 --> 50:59.750
Papa! Papa!

51:02.510 --> 51:05.380
Oh!

51:09.350 --> 51:10.890
Then...then who...?

51:14.730 --> 51:18.480
Evangeline. My name's Evangeline.

51:26.950 --> 51:30.950
And what a pretty name it is, too.

51:34.250 --> 51:36.420
Evangeline...

51:38.130 --> 51:39.630
Oh.

52:02.190 --> 52:04.610
Time for bed.

52:04.820 --> 52:08.660
- Thank you for saving me, Nanny McPhee.
- Hm.

52:10.490 --> 52:13.290
Yes. Thank you.

52:13.490 --> 52:15.710
Thank you.

52:15.910 --> 52:18.250
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

52:34.720 --> 52:36.180
Hm.

52:38.390 --> 52:41.190
Papa was going to let her take me.

52:41.400 --> 52:46.240
No, Christianna.
Your father would never have allowed it.

52:54.040 --> 52:57.830
- Goodnight, children.
- Goodnight, Nanny McPhee.

53:02.290 --> 53:04.590
She hasn't got any warts at all now.

53:04.800 --> 53:07.670
Do you think she's using
some sort of cream?

53:35.830 --> 53:39.330
Thank you, Nanny McPhee.
You were a tremendous help.

53:39.540 --> 53:40.830
Not at all.

53:41.040 --> 53:43.130
You will find that lesson three,

53:43.330 --> 53:46.750
to get dressed when they're told,
is complete.

53:46.960 --> 53:49.340
Just to get dressed when they're told?

53:49.420 --> 53:52.180
They've learned a great
deal more than that.

53:53.800 --> 53:55.970
I have five lessons to teach.

53:56.180 --> 54:00.730
What lessons they learn is entirely
up to them. Goodnight, Mr Brown.

54:00.940 --> 54:04.860
- Nanny McPhee...
- Yes, Mr Brown?

54:05.060 --> 54:09.440
She will be all right, won't she?
Evangeline, I mean.

54:10.990 --> 54:14.120
I can't help being concerned.

54:14.320 --> 54:18.370
Aunt Adelaide can be so, erm...
Well, you saw.

54:18.580 --> 54:21.080
She will certainly be all right.

54:21.290 --> 54:23.830
Good.

54:24.040 --> 54:26.420
I suppose she volunteered
to go, did she?

54:26.540 --> 54:29.000
Couldn't wait to be
shot of us, I imagine.

54:29.210 --> 54:31.050
Not quite.

54:31.260 --> 54:32.800
It was Simon's idea.

54:33.010 --> 54:35.510
He knew Evangeline
might like to educate herself

54:35.720 --> 54:38.890
and that her going
would save Christianna.

54:39.100 --> 54:40.890
He's a very clever boy.

54:41.100 --> 54:43.060
Good heavens. Simon, eh?

54:43.140 --> 54:46.690
Well, good for him.
Quick...quick thinking.

54:46.900 --> 54:49.190
Goodnight, Mr Brown.

55:03.580 --> 55:06.170
So that's it, then.

55:06.380 --> 55:09.340
I shall have to marry...Quickly.

56:02.140 --> 56:05.480
Children, your father
has asked me to tell you

56:05.680 --> 56:09.560
there's a Mrs Quickly
coming for tea tomorrow.

56:10.650 --> 56:14.570
- Nanny McPhee?
- Yes, sweetheart?

56:14.780 --> 56:19.160
Can you stop Papa
from marrying a horrible stepmother?

56:21.280 --> 56:22.990
I'm afraid not.

56:23.200 --> 56:28.540
- Even if you wanted to?
- Even if I wanted to.

56:28.750 --> 56:33.630
I cannot interfere with
affairs of the heart.

56:41.140 --> 56:43.600
Perhaps Simon could
talk to him about it.

56:43.810 --> 56:46.020
He won't listen.

56:57.610 --> 56:59.860
You have a visitor, Mr Brown.

57:00.070 --> 57:03.660
An especially eager visitor, Mr Brown.

57:13.130 --> 57:16.590
Quickly by name...

57:16.800 --> 57:17.920
Oh!

57:18.130 --> 57:20.300
Simon, my boy.

57:20.510 --> 57:22.760
Well, come in.

57:22.970 --> 57:24.930
Come on, I won't bite.

57:27.980 --> 57:32.020
- Father, we want to ask you something.
- Well, of course.

57:32.230 --> 57:34.270
Of course. Anything at all. Ask away.

57:34.480 --> 57:37.190
Who is Mrs Quickly?

57:38.740 --> 57:42.570
Good heavens, such a face. She's, er...

57:42.780 --> 57:45.530
She's...she's a friend.
She's...a friend.

57:45.740 --> 57:47.660
Just a friend?

57:47.870 --> 57:48.580
Well, my boy,

57:48.660 --> 57:51.250
it's not exactly any of
your business, is it?

57:51.460 --> 57:53.710
It is if she's to be our new mother.

57:53.920 --> 57:55.710
Who said anything about that?

57:55.920 --> 57:58.840
It is true? You are going to marry her?

58:00.510 --> 58:02.260
You go too far, Simon.

58:02.470 --> 58:04.970
- You must not question...
- I didn't.

58:05.180 --> 58:06.890
- Don't contradict me!
- I'm not!

58:07.100 --> 58:10.020
You do not understand the adult world.

58:10.230 --> 58:13.190
You know, there are
certain things that...

58:13.400 --> 58:16.110
certain things...

58:16.320 --> 58:18.690
You will leave me this instant. Go home!

58:21.450 --> 58:23.490
You never listen!

58:52.980 --> 58:54.980
Nanny McPhee?

58:57.860 --> 58:59.980
Nanny McPhee?

01:00:04.550 --> 01:00:06.930
Hello, Simon.

01:00:07.130 --> 01:00:08.720
Can I help you?

01:00:08.930 --> 01:00:11.060
I did knock.

01:00:11.260 --> 01:00:14.480
I know. I heard you.

01:00:18.060 --> 01:00:20.480
May I be of assistance?

01:00:24.190 --> 01:00:27.410
We need you to, erm...

01:00:27.610 --> 01:00:30.030
I mean...you saved Chrissie.

01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:32.950
And so...

01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:36.040
You're on our side, is what I mean.

01:00:36.250 --> 01:00:38.210
Aren't you?

01:00:38.420 --> 01:00:43.130
You saved Chrissie, and
I do not take sides.

01:00:45.010 --> 01:00:51.220
I...we... need you to help us
get rid of this woman, Mrs Quickly.

01:00:51.430 --> 01:00:56.980
It will not surprise you to hear
that I cannot agree to that, Simon.

01:00:57.180 --> 01:01:01.110
Then let us do whatever
we have to do to get rid of her.

01:01:01.310 --> 01:01:05.150
Are you prepared to accept
the consequences?

01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:06.740
Yes.

01:01:06.940 --> 01:01:10.910
- You promise?
- Yes. Yes, absolutely, I promise.

01:01:14.370 --> 01:01:20.370
Then I will, as you put it,
let you do whatever you have to do.

01:01:20.580 --> 01:01:22.380
Thank you.

01:01:24.170 --> 01:01:26.670
Thank you.

01:01:29.180 --> 01:01:33.600
Look at them! Will
you just look at them?

01:01:35.810 --> 01:01:39.980
The little, small things.

01:01:41.150 --> 01:01:43.560
Children, this is, er... Mrs Quickly.

01:01:43.770 --> 01:01:45.780
Oh, you mustn't be so formal.

01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:50.450
You must call me Auntie Selma.

01:01:50.650 --> 01:01:54.410
Oh, dear me, one does work up
such a thirst in this heat.

01:01:55.740 --> 01:01:58.160
Oh. Tea, of course. Do
go through. I'll...

01:01:58.370 --> 01:02:02.420
And leave these dear creatures?
How can you ask it of me?

01:02:04.460 --> 01:02:07.840
- Oh, the heart of the house.
- Yes, yes.

01:02:08.050 --> 01:02:10.300
- The old bachelor's den.
- Mm.

01:02:10.510 --> 01:02:13.720
- Well, l...
- lsn't it enchanting?

01:02:13.930 --> 01:02:16.220
Ooh! Have you read all those books?

01:02:16.430 --> 01:02:18.470
- Well, l, er...
- Clever.

01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:22.900
- Take my chair. It's more comfortable.
- Thank you. Ooh!

01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:25.900
Well, what have we here?

01:02:26.110 --> 01:02:29.190
I see there is already
provision for a lady.

01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:30.900
How thoughtful you are.

01:02:31.110 --> 01:02:33.160
What a gentleman.

01:02:35.070 --> 01:02:39.080
Wait! Er...just let me
make it, er...comfy for you.

01:02:39.290 --> 01:02:40.870
Too, too precious.

01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:44.830
Here in the centre of the male dominion,

01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:48.420
..an oasis of feminine
charm and elegance.

01:02:48.630 --> 01:02:53.010
There, just as I thought. It's dusty.
It just needs a good old thump.

01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:56.300
There. All thumped and ready to go.

01:02:56.510 --> 01:03:00.850
There you go again.
Nothing is too much trouble for you.

01:03:02.060 --> 01:03:06.860
I observed that very characteristic
on the sad day we buried Mr Quickly.

01:03:07.060 --> 01:03:10.530
Even in my demented grief,
I said to my friend Letitia Carter...

01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:15.280
Remember her? A pinker complexion
than my own. She takes too much sun.

01:03:15.490 --> 01:03:19.490
I said, "Kindness seems to be
second nature to him."

01:03:19.700 --> 01:03:21.700
"He is a perfect gentleman."

01:03:21.910 --> 01:03:25.920
"There's something so masculine
and yet retiring in his manner..."

01:03:26.130 --> 01:03:27.960
Mr Brown!

01:03:33.470 --> 01:03:35.510
Un moment, I pray you.

01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:37.680
I don't know what came over me.

01:03:37.890 --> 01:03:42.140
I do. I understand. I
never took you for such.

01:03:42.350 --> 01:03:47.150
But now I see it.
Passion is clearly your nature, too.

01:03:47.350 --> 01:03:52.490
I feel it. Who would have thought
we were such kindred spirits?

01:03:52.690 --> 01:03:54.240
Passion is my life.

01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:57.870
In fact, Mr Brown, what
is life without it?

01:03:58.820 --> 01:04:02.660
A grey wheel of habit, spinning idly on.

01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:14.670
This is no time for
food, Mrs Quickly...

01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:15.300
Selma.

01:04:15.510 --> 01:04:18.300
I couldn't possibly swallow it
under the circumstances.

01:04:18.510 --> 01:04:20.930
You are tempestuous, Mr Brown.

01:04:22.140 --> 01:04:25.350
- Tea?
- Yes, tea.

01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:29.270
We must blanket the raw impulse
with that reliable beverage.

01:04:32.650 --> 01:04:35.320
That's a nice bit of
porcelain. Is that Spode?

01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:37.280
I like a bit of Spode. Tasteful.

01:04:37.490 --> 01:04:41.120
Anyway, so essential
for upholding the normal...

01:04:41.330 --> 01:04:44.750
- You don't want that.
- How right you are.

01:04:44.950 --> 01:04:47.620
You see into my inmost self.

01:04:47.830 --> 01:04:52.630
What is tea when we can drink
from the nectar of our emotions?

01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:54.670
Let the common herd drink tea.

01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:58.630
Our souls need a more divine libation!

01:05:03.220 --> 01:05:06.430
Oh! You mad fool! I say.

01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:09.480
No, no, not here amongst the cutlery.

01:05:09.690 --> 01:05:11.980
I say!

01:05:13.610 --> 01:05:17.030
I must go before my reputation
is in tatters on this rug.

01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:19.450
Lovely rug. Is it Chinese silk?

01:05:19.660 --> 01:05:22.240
Must escape before all is lost.

01:05:22.450 --> 01:05:23.780
Wait!

01:05:23.990 --> 01:05:28.460
Heavens to Betsy! You are inflamed!

01:05:28.660 --> 01:05:33.340
How does a lonely widow best you?
What defences does she have?

01:05:35.090 --> 01:05:38.010
All it takes is one question, Cedric,
and I'm yours.

01:05:38.220 --> 01:05:43.510
- Ask me or you'll lose me forever.
- Oh, no... Absolutely.

01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:46.310
Say it. Say it.

01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:50.350
- Say it. Say it.
- No!

01:05:51.060 --> 01:05:55.570
Oh! No! This is too much, sir!

01:05:56.940 --> 01:05:59.070
You are a cad!

01:06:00.950 --> 01:06:04.200
A bounder and a cad!

01:06:04.990 --> 01:06:07.830
Yeah!

01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:09.910
Papa's coming.

01:06:21.590 --> 01:06:24.430
She's gone.

01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:29.100
The only person in the whole world
who stands between all of us

01:06:29.310 --> 01:06:31.980
and total ruin...

01:06:32.190 --> 01:06:35.060
and she's gone.

01:06:36.610 --> 01:06:38.730
What's ruin?

01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:44.870
There's no time to mince words.
I can't support my own family.

01:06:45.070 --> 01:06:48.660
I never have been able to.
There are so many of you.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.040
But you're all so delicious.

01:06:52.250 --> 01:06:55.670
When Aggy came along
and your mother was so ill, I said,

01:06:55.880 --> 01:07:00.210
"We may have to stop now, dear,"
and she said...

01:07:00.420 --> 01:07:02.930
She said, "l know."

01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:13.690
The fact of the matter is,
your Great-Aunt Adelaide

01:07:13.890 --> 01:07:17.820
has been supporting us for years
with a monthly allowance.

01:07:18.020 --> 01:07:20.440
A little while ago, she told me

01:07:20.650 --> 01:07:23.820
that I had to remarry
or the allowance would stop.

01:07:24.030 --> 01:07:27.030
This woman today was my last chance.

01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:29.370
Our last chance.

01:07:29.580 --> 01:07:31.330
Ours?

01:07:32.790 --> 01:07:36.460
When the money stops,
the house will be taken.

01:07:36.670 --> 01:07:40.090
Some of you will perhaps
be put into the workhouse.

01:07:40.300 --> 01:07:44.840
Some will be put into the care...
into the care of others.

01:07:45.930 --> 01:07:49.760
I don't know how many of you
will be allowed to stay together.

01:07:56.650 --> 01:07:58.690
I'm sorry to have failed you, children.

01:08:02.740 --> 01:08:05.320
You deserve so much better.

01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:14.330
- Do something.
- What would you suggest?

01:08:14.540 --> 01:08:19.460
Change what happened.
Bang your stick. Make it undo itself.

01:08:19.670 --> 01:08:21.880
I cannot. These were your actions.

01:08:22.090 --> 01:08:25.760
Simon promised that you would
accept the consequences.

01:08:25.970 --> 01:08:29.430
What shall we do?
Help us. Tell us what to do.

01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:34.229
- You must undo it for yourselves.
- How? How?

01:08:34.430 --> 01:08:36.770
Think.

01:08:36.979 --> 01:08:39.810
You are very clever, children.

01:08:40.020 --> 01:08:41.609
Think.

01:08:45.279 --> 01:08:46.649
So, 'e was keen?

01:08:46.740 --> 01:08:49.990
Oh, Letty, he was in
a maddened condition.

01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:53.370
He couldn't keep his hands off me.
But I held firm.

01:08:53.580 --> 01:08:58.420
I said, "Shedric..." I mean, "Cedric,
I have my reputation to uphold."

01:08:58.620 --> 01:09:01.540
"It's marriage or nothing.
What do you take me for?"

01:09:01.750 --> 01:09:03.050
"Some common...?"

01:09:03.250 --> 01:09:05.880
- Tart?
- Not for me. I'm bloated.

01:09:06.090 --> 01:09:08.470
No."Some common tart." You said...

01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:11.470
Who's that knocking?

01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:13.720
It might be him.

01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:18.890
If you've come to fumble
with my fastenings... Oh.

01:09:20.479 --> 01:09:23.149
Mrs Quickly, we're very
sorry about the tea...

01:09:23.229 --> 01:09:24.609
you had with our father.

01:09:24.819 --> 01:09:27.240
Typical of a man, sending
his little ones...

01:09:27.359 --> 01:09:28.490
to do the dirty work.

01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:31.240
No. He doesn't know we're...

01:09:31.450 --> 01:09:33.950
I mean, he very much wants to marry you.

01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:38.210
I know what he wanted.
No wonder there's so many of you!

01:09:38.410 --> 01:09:42.920
Wait. Father wasn't being rude.
No one on earth could be less rude.

01:09:43.130 --> 01:09:46.380
He was protecting you from
the naughty things we were doing.

01:09:46.590 --> 01:09:49.720
- The toad in the teapot.
- And the wormy sandwiches.

01:09:49.930 --> 01:09:53.390
That was my idea! I mean, my fault.

01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:56.600
I have no idea to what
you can be referring.

01:09:56.810 --> 01:10:00.940
Don't try to make excuses for him.
He's a flounder and a gad.

01:10:01.150 --> 01:10:04.650
He's not. He's a good man.
He was just trying to save us.

01:10:04.860 --> 01:10:07.400
If he doesn't marry,
all the money will go.

01:10:07.490 --> 01:10:09.700
We'll be thrown out onto the streets.

01:10:09.900 --> 01:10:13.780
- Money? What money?
- Our Great-Aunt Adelaide's money.

01:10:13.990 --> 01:10:16.490
Lady Adelaide Stitch.

01:10:16.700 --> 01:10:19.410
Lady? Ooh!

01:10:20.710 --> 01:10:22.670
- Mr Brown.
- Mrs Quickly.

01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:26.130
- Your children have explained it all.
- Explained?

01:10:26.340 --> 01:10:28.630
That their tricks during
tea was a result...

01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:30.300
of their motherless condition,

01:10:30.510 --> 01:10:33.140
that they need a woman's presence
to calm them,

01:10:33.340 --> 01:10:36.100
and that you could benefit
from that presence,

01:10:36.310 --> 01:10:38.470
pathetic and lonely as you are.

01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:44.730
And all it takes is one
little question, Cedric.

01:10:47.190 --> 01:10:50.360
Oh. Oh, y... er...yes, of course.

01:10:50.570 --> 01:10:52.950
Erm...just give me...Yes.

01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:56.240
- Mrs Quickly...
- Selma.

01:10:56.450 --> 01:10:58.330
Yes, I mean Selma.

01:10:58.540 --> 01:11:02.710
Would you do me the honour
of becoming my...

01:11:05.330 --> 01:11:08.210
- ..of becoming my...
- Wife.

01:11:08.420 --> 01:11:13.720
- Exactly. Wife. That's the word.
- Yes. Oh, yes, Cedric.

01:11:19.350 --> 01:11:22.140
Off you go now, dears.

01:11:22.350 --> 01:11:25.690
Let Daddy have a little
moment to himself...

01:11:25.770 --> 01:11:27.270
with your new mummy.

01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:34.280
A bit big for this nightie, aren't...

01:11:34.410 --> 01:11:36.870
you, sweetheart? We'll
have a new one made.

01:11:46.710 --> 01:11:48.750
I'm sorry.

01:11:51.090 --> 01:11:54.590
I should have told you.
I can see that now.

01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:58.680
If I'd discussed it with you before,
we wouldn't be in this mess.

01:12:00.310 --> 01:12:03.270
No, it was our fault.

01:12:05.730 --> 01:12:09.610
We should have known you had
a good reason for getting married.

01:12:09.820 --> 01:12:13.030
At least this way,
we'll all be together.

01:12:13.110 --> 01:12:16.160
That's what matters most, isn't it? Hm?

01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:19.740
I promise I'll never hide anything
that affects us from you again.

01:12:19.950 --> 01:12:23.040
I see you're more than capable
of understanding it.

01:12:24.580 --> 01:12:27.500
- Papa?
- Yes, my boy?

01:12:27.710 --> 01:12:31.960
Do you think Mama still thinks about us
where she is?

01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:37.010
I'm sure she does.

01:12:38.890 --> 01:12:41.010
I know she does.

01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:50.650
Now, Chrissie,
why don't you choose us a story?

01:12:52.730 --> 01:12:55.320
# Tiptoe by

01:12:55.530 --> 01:12:59.070
- # Where my babies lie...
- Lesson four is complete.

01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:02.740
# In your tiny silver shoon...

01:13:02.950 --> 01:13:05.370
Lesson four?

01:13:06.750 --> 01:13:09.290
To listen.

01:13:12.290 --> 01:13:13.920
Well done.

01:13:14.130 --> 01:13:19.680
# Will you watch over, please

01:13:19.890 --> 01:13:23.100
# My wee ones

01:13:23.310 --> 01:13:26.730
# My lambkins

01:13:26.930 --> 01:13:32.900
# My sweet chick-a-chickadees

01:13:33.860 --> 01:13:39.780
# Loola-bye, oh, loola-bye

01:13:40.870 --> 01:13:53.500
# In your tiny silver shoon #

01:13:58.340 --> 01:14:01.340
The big day.
I do love my weddings.

01:14:01.550 --> 01:14:04.140
Mr Brown. What's he really like?

01:14:04.350 --> 01:14:07.060
No idea. Keen as mustard
to tie the knot, though.

01:14:07.270 --> 01:14:11.020
Had to sort this out quick.
Only got the sheep dipped yesterday.

01:14:11.230 --> 01:14:15.070
But he's easily controlled,
unlike his nasty little brood.

01:14:15.270 --> 01:14:17.780
However will you manage them, Selma?

01:14:17.990 --> 01:14:20.910
I've got a few tricks up my sleeve.
Never you mind.

01:14:21.110 --> 01:14:24.080
I started off by giving
them a good clean-up.

01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:26.540
Oh, don't they look lovely?

01:14:28.450 --> 01:14:31.250
Sebastian, your top button is undone.

01:14:31.460 --> 01:14:35.800
Lily, you have a little hair caught
in your crook. Eric, help her, please.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.840
Your father will be down in a moment.

01:14:39.050 --> 01:14:43.720
Now, that is an improvement.
Letty, go and keep a lookout.

01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:46.890
I say, whatever your name is,

01:14:47.100 --> 01:14:50.230
give me a second on my own
with the little darlings?

01:14:55.230 --> 01:15:00.070
Now, my dears, there's going to be
some changes made round here.

01:15:01.740 --> 01:15:04.070
I'm in charge of this household now

01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:08.790
and while I'm in charge,
you children will behave.

01:15:08.990 --> 01:15:12.750
Do you hear? Behave.

01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:17.340
Behave.

01:15:19.670 --> 01:15:22.510
And we're not having any
of that nasty noise...

01:15:22.630 --> 01:15:24.800
all the way through my nice wedding.

01:15:25.010 --> 01:15:29.930
Shut her up.

01:15:31.890 --> 01:15:33.560
Naughty.

01:15:33.770 --> 01:15:36.060
It's our mother's rattle. Give it back.

01:15:36.270 --> 01:15:38.440
I'm your mother now.

01:15:44.070 --> 01:15:46.160
Time to adapt.

01:15:55.500 --> 01:15:57.590
Papa, Mrs Quickly...

01:15:57.790 --> 01:15:59.960
Yoo-hoo, Cedric.

01:16:00.170 --> 01:16:03.720
I realise the bride and groom
shouldn't meet until the ceremony,

01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:06.800
but you and I are old hands at this.

01:16:07.010 --> 01:16:11.140
She's here! Lady Stitch!

01:16:11.350 --> 01:16:13.020
Selma, there's footmen.

01:16:15.020 --> 01:16:18.690
Oi, make way!

01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:23.820
Where's the woman?

01:16:24.030 --> 01:16:27.450
- Aunt Adelaide...
- Shut up! Where's the woman, Cedric?

01:16:27.660 --> 01:16:30.370
May I present my...fiancee,
Selma Quickly.

01:16:30.490 --> 01:16:32.200
Selma, this is Lady Stitch.

01:16:32.410 --> 01:16:36.290
Your Ladyness. Welcome,
if I may be so bold,

01:16:36.500 --> 01:16:39.090
to our humble, nay, lowly festivities.

01:16:39.290 --> 01:16:42.510
You shower glory upon us from above.

01:16:42.710 --> 01:16:46.550
The very air about you shines with...

01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:50.930
with...with aboveness.

01:16:51.140 --> 01:16:55.310
A gracious welcome, I must say.
Rise, my dear.

01:16:55.520 --> 01:16:58.310
Here are the children
in their, erm...shepherdess outfits.

01:16:58.520 --> 01:17:02.690
Well, that's the girls.
The boys... I'm not sure what they are.

01:17:02.900 --> 01:17:04.940
But, erm...anyway, you can see.

01:17:05.150 --> 01:17:07.320
Oh, keep up, will you?

01:17:26.590 --> 01:17:28.590
Who's that?

01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:32.890
- It's a princess.
- A fairy princess.

01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:37.310
It's Evangeline.

01:17:40.060 --> 01:17:43.980
Straight back. Remember your vowels.

01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:50.660
May I present my adopted daughter,
Miss Evangeline Stitch.

01:17:54.700 --> 01:17:58.330
What are we doing milling about
in this dreary vestibule?

01:17:58.540 --> 01:18:00.670
Sherry this instant.

01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:05.380
Might I beg the honour of pouring
the privileged schooners myself?

01:18:06.590 --> 01:18:09.720
Delectable to see you again, madam.

01:18:09.930 --> 01:18:12.090
Blinkin' hell!

01:18:14.310 --> 01:18:17.180
And how nice to see the young people.

01:18:17.390 --> 01:18:21.520
Welcome back, Evangeline.
You look well. Are you well?

01:18:21.730 --> 01:18:24.730
I am most content.

01:18:26.030 --> 01:18:29.820
You must be very happy
to be marrying again.

01:18:30.860 --> 01:18:35.790
Oh, yes, I'm... I'm...
How did you put it? Most content.

01:18:35.990 --> 01:18:38.870
Of course. Good grief.

01:18:40.500 --> 01:18:42.540
I am so glad.

01:18:42.750 --> 01:18:44.920
Evangeline!

01:18:45.130 --> 01:18:47.710
Pray excuse me.

01:18:50.130 --> 01:18:54.390
Are you sure it's Evangeline?
It doesn't look anything like her.

01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:57.470
Nonsense. She's always looked like that.

01:19:29.210 --> 01:19:32.760
What can we do?
There has to be another way.

01:19:32.970 --> 01:19:36.180
- Behave.
- Beehive.

01:19:36.390 --> 01:19:38.260
You must do as you're told.

01:19:38.470 --> 01:19:40.810
- Behave.
- Beehive.

01:19:41.020 --> 01:19:45.980
Lesson number five, Simon.
You must do exactly as you're told.

01:19:54.990 --> 01:19:56.740
Beehive.

01:19:56.950 --> 01:19:58.330
Beehive?

01:19:58.530 --> 01:20:00.240
Please be seated.

01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:04.370
There isn't a beehive. What do you mean?

01:20:07.630 --> 01:20:12.130
Dearly beloved, we are
gathered here together

01:20:12.340 --> 01:20:17.180
in the sight of God
and in the face of this congregation

01:20:17.390 --> 01:20:21.680
to join together this man and this woman

01:20:21.890 --> 01:20:24.850
in holy matrimony,

01:20:25.060 --> 01:20:30.400
which is an honourable estate
instituted of God

01:20:30.610 --> 01:20:33.570
in the time of man's innocence...

01:20:36.070 --> 01:20:38.700
..and commended of St Paul...

01:20:38.910 --> 01:20:42.240
..to be honoured among all men.

01:20:42.450 --> 01:20:44.120
Get off!

01:20:44.330 --> 01:20:46.960
- And is therefore...
- Get off!

01:20:47.170 --> 01:20:50.670
- .. not by any man to be enterprised...
- There's one on you!

01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:56.380
.. nor taken in hand unadvisedly,
lightly, wantonly...

01:20:57.300 --> 01:21:01.810
- There's one on your back!
- ..to satisfy man's carnal lusts...

01:21:02.010 --> 01:21:05.600
It's the flowers on her dress!
They're attracting them!

01:21:05.810 --> 01:21:08.810
- I hate bees. I'm allergic.
- There aren't any bees, you fool!

01:21:09.020 --> 01:21:11.770
No, truly, I swell up.

01:21:11.980 --> 01:21:13.360
They're trying to ruin...

01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:15.900
my lovely wedding. Nasty,
vicious creatures.

01:21:16.110 --> 01:21:18.740
Do something!

01:21:20.450 --> 01:21:23.990
Cedric, look at me. Do you see any bees?

01:21:31.960 --> 01:21:36.760
I said, look at me!
Do you see any bees? Do you?

01:21:36.970 --> 01:21:39.390
- Do you?
- I do.

01:21:39.590 --> 01:21:44.270
It's all right. I've
got the little bugger.

01:21:44.470 --> 01:21:47.020
It's on me!

01:21:47.230 --> 01:21:52.150
Lord love a duck! I'm
so dreadfully sorry!

01:21:54.860 --> 01:21:56.570
No, no, no, no, no...

01:21:59.950 --> 01:22:03.410
Oh, my Lord. Your Higherness!

01:22:32.940 --> 01:22:36.070
- Don't touch the cake!
- Get the tarts!

01:22:36.280 --> 01:22:38.820
- Not me good ones!
- Ow, he hit me!

01:22:39.900 --> 01:22:41.910
Attack!

01:22:43.700 --> 01:22:46.040
Not the cake! Not the cake!

01:22:47.950 --> 01:22:50.710
Right! I'll have the lot of you!

01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:53.580
Simon, bowling practice.

01:23:23.910 --> 01:23:26.490
Evangeline, where are your manners?

01:23:26.700 --> 01:23:28.490
Sod my manners, you old trout.

01:23:28.700 --> 01:23:31.790
This is the first fun I've had in weeks!

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:36.710
- Oh, Lord.
- Letty, my hair. Where is it?

01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:41.010
"Look at them, the
little, small things."

01:23:41.220 --> 01:23:46.470
That's it! You dreadful, awful,
monstrous creatures!

01:23:46.680 --> 01:23:48.930
Take your hands off my children!

01:23:49.140 --> 01:23:53.480
Cedric, it's over! I won't spend
another minute with this rabble

01:23:53.690 --> 01:23:56.980
and I don't care how much
the old hag is giving you.

01:23:57.190 --> 01:23:59.820
Letty, the lambs!

01:24:03.740 --> 01:24:06.570
- This dress is ruined!
- Absolute carnage!

01:24:06.780 --> 01:24:10.580
A nice choice for a
wife, I must say, Cedric.

01:24:10.790 --> 01:24:13.660
I'm sorry. You gave me no time
to find anyone else.

01:24:13.870 --> 01:24:16.420
As for your children, a lengthy spell...

01:24:16.540 --> 01:24:19.340
in a corrective institution
is long overdue.

01:24:19.550 --> 01:24:22.050
And you, Evangeline, I can see...

01:24:22.130 --> 01:24:25.260
that you are as wild
as the rest of them.

01:24:25.470 --> 01:24:28.010
And proud to be. I love
them, Lady Stitch,

01:24:28.140 --> 01:24:29.680
which is more than you do.

01:24:29.890 --> 01:24:31.770
Insolence!

01:24:31.970 --> 01:24:33.810
I'd leave you here to rot,

01:24:33.930 --> 01:24:36.850
but I gave my word
that I would raise you

01:24:37.060 --> 01:24:41.070
and I never, ever, break my word.
Come away now.

01:25:07.130 --> 01:25:08.970
Wait, Aunt Adelaide! Wait!

01:25:10.350 --> 01:25:12.640
You agreed. You gave your word

01:25:12.850 --> 01:25:15.640
that if our father remarried this month,
you'd support us.

01:25:15.850 --> 01:25:17.520
I did.

01:25:17.730 --> 01:25:20.900
So if he marries today,
you'll have to keep your word.

01:25:21.110 --> 01:25:23.650
- Oh, you're wasting my time!
- No.

01:25:23.860 --> 01:25:26.700
No. No, I'm not.

01:25:28.070 --> 01:25:30.120
- He will marry today.
- What?

01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:31.450
- What?
- What?

01:25:31.660 --> 01:25:32.660
What?

01:25:32.870 --> 01:25:37.420
- Who?
- He'll marry Evangeline.

01:25:46.420 --> 01:25:48.880
Incest?

01:25:49.090 --> 01:25:53.060
No! No, Aunt Adelaide.
Evangeline isn't our sister.

01:25:53.260 --> 01:25:55.810
- Not your sister?
- Of course she's not our sister.

01:25:57.270 --> 01:25:59.400
Well, who is she, then?

01:26:02.900 --> 01:26:05.360
I'm his scullery maid.

01:26:05.570 --> 01:26:06.780
What?

01:26:06.990 --> 01:26:10.320
Evangeline, do you love Papa?

01:26:12.830 --> 01:26:17.330
Of course not. I know my place.
That wouldn't be right. I mean...

01:26:19.250 --> 01:26:20.750
Yes.

01:26:27.470 --> 01:26:29.470
Papa, do you love Evangeline?

01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:31.890
What? That would be totally improper.

01:26:32.090 --> 01:26:35.180
A thing like that
could...could never happen.

01:26:35.310 --> 01:26:36.640
I mean, obviously...

01:26:42.440 --> 01:26:44.150
Yes.

01:26:47.820 --> 01:26:51.320
He's marrying the scullery maid?

01:26:51.530 --> 01:26:52.820
Oh!

01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:45.170
It's snowing!

01:27:45.380 --> 01:27:48.130
Well, I never! Snow!

01:27:48.340 --> 01:27:50.800
Snow in August!

01:28:11.820 --> 01:28:14.450
I take it, then, Mr Brown,

01:28:14.660 --> 01:28:18.240
that the young lady
is not in fact the fruit of your loins?

01:28:18.450 --> 01:28:23.870
Because the Church would have to take
a rather dim view of it if she were.

01:28:24.080 --> 01:28:28.250
No. What happened was my son Simon
is a very clever boy.

01:28:28.460 --> 01:28:30.000
Evangeline...

01:28:30.210 --> 01:28:31.010
for the record,

01:28:31.130 --> 01:28:33.510
whatever I may have
said about stepmothers,

01:28:33.720 --> 01:28:35.680
that whole "evil breed" moment,

01:28:35.890 --> 01:28:39.470
most emphatically does not apply to you.

01:28:44.100 --> 01:28:46.230
This way.

01:28:46.440 --> 01:28:52.400
Jolly good. If I may then invite you all
to join us once more.

01:28:52.610 --> 01:28:54.110
Hallelujah.

01:28:54.320 --> 01:28:58.870
Oh, Nanny McPhee... I'm so nervous.

01:28:59.080 --> 01:29:01.200
Deep breaths.

01:29:02.370 --> 01:29:05.460
I don't look much like a bride, do l?

01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:09.340
You will.

01:30:01.760 --> 01:30:04.180
How's the reading coming along?

01:30:04.390 --> 01:30:06.680
It's much better.

01:30:06.890 --> 01:30:09.980
But I still haven't got to the end
of that story.

01:30:10.190 --> 01:30:14.900
No need. You are the end of the story.

01:30:41.840 --> 01:30:45.770
Dearly beloved, we are gathered together

01:30:45.970 --> 01:30:49.850
to join together this man and this woman

01:30:50.060 --> 01:30:53.270
in holy matrimony.

01:30:58.990 --> 01:31:01.820
Make a loud noise and rejoice

01:31:02.030 --> 01:31:04.240
and sing praise.

01:31:20.630 --> 01:31:21.970
There is something...

01:31:22.050 --> 01:31:24.800
you should understand
about the way I work.

01:31:25.010 --> 01:31:30.060
When you need me but do not want me,
then I must stay.

01:31:30.270 --> 01:31:34.190
When you want me but no longer need me,

01:31:34.400 --> 01:31:36.520
then I have to go.

01:34:04.130 --> 01:34:06.010
Yoo-hoo!

01:35:06.690 --> 01:34:06.010
