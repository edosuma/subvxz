Stan, what are you doing home?

00:35.667 --> 00:37.000
It's only 4:00.

00:37.041 --> 00:38.000
They all went bowling.

00:38.041 --> 00:38.917
Who did?

00:38.959 --> 00:40.208
Bullock and his
Inner Circle.

00:40.250 --> 00:42.834
Well, why don't you ask to be
in the Inner Circle?

00:42.875 --> 00:44.000
I did.

00:44.750 --> 00:45.750
Sir?

00:48.125 --> 00:49.875
Smith, what are you doing here?

00:49.917 --> 00:51.583
Can I be in the
Inner Circle?

00:51.625 --> 00:53.542
No! And shut the door.

00:53.583 --> 00:57.166
Taxpayers are paying top dollar
for this wind.

00:57.208 --> 00:59.166
All the agents in
the Inner Circle

00:59.208 --> 01:00.875
were flying like
birds, Francine,

01:00.917 --> 01:02.875
and I was just standing
there on the ground,

01:02.917 --> 01:04.083
like a stupid mammal.

01:04.125 --> 01:06.291
Well, I don't think
you're a mammal.

01:06.333 --> 01:07.375
Morning, guys.

01:07.417 --> 01:08.875
Morning? You
better be talking

01:08.917 --> 01:10.875
about former Charlotte
Hornet Alonzo Mourning,

01:10.917 --> 01:12.208
because it's 4:00
in the afternoon.

01:12.250 --> 01:13.875
You can't possibly
just be getting up.

01:13.917 --> 01:15.000
Whatevs.

01:15.041 --> 01:17.834
Mom, hands, eggs, make.

01:17.875 --> 01:19.000
You, hold it right there.

01:19.041 --> 01:20.542
You, make your own eggs.

01:20.583 --> 01:22.792
You, stay beautiful.

01:22.834 --> 01:24.583
I don't know how
to make eggs.

01:24.625 --> 01:26.208
Mom always makes
my breakfast.

01:26.250 --> 01:27.375
Oh, my God.

01:27.417 --> 01:29.333
You can't make food,
you sleep all day,

01:29.375 --> 01:30.917
you barely form
complete sentences.

01:30.959 --> 01:32.417
What are you talking me at?

01:32.458 --> 01:34.208
You have no survival skills.

01:34.250 --> 01:36.166
Oh, don't be
so overdramatic.

01:36.208 --> 01:38.250
Someday, we are
gonna die, Francine.

01:38.291 --> 01:39.583
You sooner than
me, probably,

01:39.625 --> 01:40.959
with all that string
cheese you eat,

01:41.000 --> 01:42.917
but we're both gonna go,
and when we do,

01:42.959 --> 01:45.667
this girl right here is not
qualified to be anything

01:45.709 --> 01:47.625
other than a stripper
or a crack whore

01:47.667 --> 01:49.333
or a-a...

01:49.375 --> 01:51.041
Oh, I was sure
there was a third.

01:51.083 --> 01:55.417
Uh, stripper, crack
whore, grocery bagger?

01:55.458 --> 01:57.375
No, no, that's a
noble profession.

01:57.417 --> 01:58.875
I have plenty
of survival skills.

01:58.917 --> 02:00.792
The prove it.
Effective immediately,

02:00.834 --> 02:03.250
you are gonna start paying
rent around here, young lady.

02:03.291 --> 02:04.667
How am I supposed
to afford that?

02:04.709 --> 02:07.208
You've got survival
skills; figure it out.

02:07.250 --> 02:09.792
Go be something other than
a stripper or a crack whore

02:09.875 --> 02:11.500
or a-a... or a...

02:11.542 --> 02:13.083
Oh, God, that is
so annoying.

02:13.125 --> 02:15.208
Uh, stay-at-home mom.

02:15.250 --> 02:17.625
It was right in front
of me the whole time.

02:21.458 --> 02:23.375
Thanks for the bartending job,
Roger.

02:23.417 --> 02:25.709
My dad is insisting
I pay rent.

02:25.750 --> 02:26.834
I don't blame him.

02:26.875 --> 02:28.458
Somebody's got to pay
for all this neon,

02:28.500 --> 02:29.750
and it's not gonna be me.

02:29.792 --> 02:32.125
All my money goes to
experimental VD treatments.

02:32.166 --> 02:33.917
Anyway, now that
you're a bartender,

02:33.959 --> 02:36.000
people are gonna share a
lot of things with you,

02:36.041 --> 02:38.458
and the better listener you are,
the better tips you'll get.

02:38.500 --> 02:39.792
Except for Carlos.

02:39.834 --> 02:41.667
He's gonna offer you a tip.

02:41.709 --> 02:42.834
You don't want that tip.

02:42.875 --> 02:46.041
That tip is connected
to his body.

02:46.083 --> 02:49.500
I am so excited
to share Das Boot with you.

02:49.542 --> 02:52.583
This is the greatest
German movie of all time.

02:52.625 --> 02:55.542
If you don't count
the Hindenburg footage.

02:59.125 --> 03:01.125
What's so funny?
They're just eating dinner.

03:01.166 --> 03:05.041
It's a reference to Das Kleines
Madchen und Der Zwergenhafter.

03:05.083 --> 03:07.417
The Little Girl
and the Little Person?

03:07.458 --> 03:08.333
No idea.

03:08.375 --> 03:09.583
What?

03:09.625 --> 03:12.125
You don't know
the famous German fairy tale

03:12.166 --> 03:14.792
The Little Girl
and the Little Person?

03:16.458 --> 03:18.000
You can't fully
appreciate this movie

03:18.041 --> 03:19.667
without knowing
this story.

03:21.291 --> 03:24.041
Once upon a time,
there was a little girl

03:24.083 --> 03:28.041
with hair as golden
as sauerkraut.

03:28.083 --> 03:30.875
Das Madchen was taking
her beloved schnauzer

03:30.917 --> 03:32.583
for a walk one day,

03:32.625 --> 03:34.917
when she came
upon a little person

03:34.959 --> 03:36.375
toiling in the fields.

03:36.417 --> 03:37.792
Why am I the little girl?

03:37.834 --> 03:39.250
And why am I
the little person?

03:39.291 --> 03:41.375
Because German kinder
do what they're told!

03:41.417 --> 03:42.625
Now shut up and listen!

03:42.667 --> 03:45.625
Suddenly, the little person
saw an eagle

03:45.667 --> 03:47.417
soaring overhead.

03:47.458 --> 03:49.333
Achtung, an eagle.

03:49.375 --> 03:50.834
The little girl cowered,

03:50.875 --> 03:53.583
since we all know
what natural sworn enemies

03:53.625 --> 03:55.041
schnauzers and eagles are.

03:55.083 --> 03:56.834
Wait, why schnauzers and eagles

03:56.875 --> 03:58.875
be natural sworn enemies?

03:58.917 --> 04:00.041
What?

04:00.083 --> 04:02.375
You don't know the
story of the schnauzer

04:02.417 --> 04:05.041
who stole the eagle's worm?

04:05.083 --> 04:07.000
Well, now I have to tell
you that story first,

04:07.041 --> 04:08.834
because you can't
get the other story

04:08.875 --> 04:10.291
without knowing this story.

04:11.959 --> 04:14.917
Once upon a time...

04:16.709 --> 04:18.583
Oh, God.

04:22.458 --> 04:24.667
Stan,
I know you want Hayley

04:24.709 --> 04:26.291
to learn to take care
of herself,

04:26.333 --> 04:28.041
but is Roger's bar

04:28.083 --> 04:29.875
the healthiest environment
for her?

04:29.917 --> 04:32.083
Will you go up there
and see if she's okay?

04:32.125 --> 04:33.834
Spy on Hayley? Sure.

04:33.875 --> 04:35.667
It's been years
since I've gone undercover.

04:35.709 --> 04:38.041
Let me refresh myself
on my special skills.

04:41.583 --> 04:43.291
Oye, dis'll be as easy

04:43.333 --> 04:46.792
as rolling a spliff
in Kingston Town, mon.

04:46.834 --> 04:49.083
♪ ♪

05:02.834 --> 05:05.417
How do you do that, man?

05:16.500 --> 05:18.333
Good Lord, Francine is right.

05:18.375 --> 05:20.083
I can't let Hayley work here.

05:20.125 --> 05:22.375
Want to know
what I really think?

05:22.417 --> 05:25.166
Agents don't have
any style anymore.

05:25.208 --> 05:29.208
If some agent today were
to have the sense of élan

05:29.250 --> 05:33.750
to walk into my office
wearing a pocket square,

05:33.792 --> 05:36.041
what I wouldn't do for that man.

05:36.083 --> 05:39.166
Maybe even let him
into the Inner Circle?

05:40.000 --> 05:41.417
I'll have another.

05:41.458 --> 05:43.291
And pour one for yourself.

05:43.333 --> 05:44.834
Sorry, on the clock.

05:44.875 --> 05:47.000
Ah, but I insist.

05:47.041 --> 05:49.166
Okay, why not?

05:52.041 --> 05:53.625
Don't get too drunk, Avery.

05:53.667 --> 05:55.583
I know you're a guy
with a lot of secrets,

05:55.625 --> 05:57.125
and, you know, loose lips.

05:57.166 --> 05:58.375
You're my bartender.

05:58.417 --> 06:01.041
If I can't share
with you, who can I?

06:01.083 --> 06:04.500
I might even tell you
my favorite animal.

06:04.542 --> 06:05.792
I'll give you a hint.

06:05.834 --> 06:08.375
Meow.

06:10.375 --> 06:12.208
Francine, what the hell
is a pocket square?

06:12.250 --> 06:13.917
What?
It's a decorative kerchief.

06:13.959 --> 06:15.125
Who cares?

06:15.166 --> 06:16.291
How was the bar?

06:16.333 --> 06:18.500
Is Hayley gonna be okay
working up there?

06:18.542 --> 06:19.875
Huh? Oh, oh, great bar.

06:19.917 --> 06:21.125
Great bar, classy bar.

06:25.250 --> 06:27.792
Free drinks for everyone
who saw him threaten me.

06:28.792 --> 06:29.959
Great bar.

06:34.667 --> 06:36.625
All right, pocket square,

06:36.667 --> 06:38.667
time to work your magic.

06:38.709 --> 06:40.542
This is Rihanna.

06:40.583 --> 06:42.291
This is Katy Perry.

06:42.333 --> 06:44.500
This is Selena Gomez.

06:44.542 --> 06:47.417
All right, that completes
today's hotties.

06:47.458 --> 06:48.417
Smith,

06:48.458 --> 06:49.959
this meeting
doesn't concern you.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.333
If we need...

06:55.125 --> 06:56.417
I'm sorry.

06:56.458 --> 06:59.250
I didn't mean to use
a harsh tone there.

06:59.291 --> 07:02.875
Would you step
into my office, please?

07:02.917 --> 07:04.792
We're not to be disturbed.

07:06.208 --> 07:08.875
Unless you see something
funny on YouTube.

07:08.917 --> 07:13.333
Smith, I had no idea you
rock it in the pocket.

07:13.375 --> 07:14.709
Feast your eyes.

07:17.875 --> 07:19.625
You like
pocket squares, too?

07:19.667 --> 07:21.125
I do. In fact,

07:21.166 --> 07:22.500
the first time I wore one,

07:22.542 --> 07:24.875
I was at Buzz Aldrin's
bachelor party.

07:24.917 --> 07:28.417
Oh, you're not in
the Inner Circle,

07:28.458 --> 07:29.834
but keep up the good work.

07:29.875 --> 07:30.959
Sir, come quick.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.417
Some frat boys put sunglasses
on a bulldog,

07:33.458 --> 07:36.291
and he's walking around
to "Bad to the Bone."

07:36.333 --> 07:38.583
They're pulling him
in a wagon now!

07:43.917 --> 07:45.959
Hayley?

07:46.000 --> 07:47.959
Hey, button-nose,
time to get up.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.417
Got to get ready for work.

07:49.458 --> 07:51.041
Not feeling so good.

07:51.083 --> 07:52.417
So, listen,
I couldn't help but notice

07:52.458 --> 07:54.166
that Bullock was in the bar
last night.

07:54.208 --> 07:55.542
Any fun stories or anything?

07:55.583 --> 07:57.417
Dad, I can't
tell you that.

07:57.458 --> 07:58.792
Bartender's code.

07:58.834 --> 07:59.750
Oh, no, no, of course.

07:59.792 --> 08:01.291
You don't need to tell me
about codes.

08:01.333 --> 08:03.291
Morse, da Vinci,
I follow them all.

08:03.333 --> 08:04.625
Now get up.

08:04.667 --> 08:06.625
Important people need
to unload their secrets on you.

08:06.667 --> 08:08.750
But I'm-I'm just
so hungover.

08:08.792 --> 08:10.375
Bullock's there every night,

08:10.417 --> 08:12.583
and he always insists
that I drink with him.

08:12.625 --> 08:15.000
Oh, maybe I should just
get a different job.

08:15.041 --> 08:16.458
What? Oh, no, no, no.

08:16.500 --> 08:17.959
Come on now,
that's where you're working.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.542
Now, let's not have
any silly talk

08:19.583 --> 08:21.083
of you quitting that job.

08:21.125 --> 08:22.542
Quitting is for Realtors

08:22.583 --> 08:23.875
before they become Realtors.

08:23.917 --> 08:26.041
I'll leave you with that.

08:30.291 --> 08:33.583
And so the Frog King said
to the Burgermeister...

08:33.625 --> 08:35.625
At long last,
Herr Frederick,

08:35.667 --> 08:37.417
what gift have you
brought for me?

08:37.458 --> 08:40.125
The only gift I have,
mein King,

08:40.166 --> 08:43.500
is the gift of Liebenspiel.

08:43.542 --> 08:44.875
The end.

08:44.917 --> 08:46.875
I know I'm gonna regret this,

08:46.917 --> 08:49.834
but what exactly
is Liebenspiel?

08:49.875 --> 08:51.083
What?

08:51.125 --> 08:53.750
You don't know the
meaning of Liebenspiel?

08:53.792 --> 08:55.500
Stop asking questions!

08:55.542 --> 08:57.917
We've been listening
to these stupid stories forever.

08:57.959 --> 09:00.917
I can't take another day
off school.

09:03.500 --> 09:06.333
Hey, button-nose.
Now, don't worry.

09:06.375 --> 09:08.667
I'm not gonna ask you to
break the bartender's code.

09:08.709 --> 09:10.375
I just thought I'd
bring you some flowers

09:10.417 --> 09:11.625
to show how proud I am of you.

09:11.667 --> 09:13.333
Don't water these.

09:13.375 --> 09:15.166
Aw, thank you.

09:15.208 --> 09:16.959
That's very
thoughtful of you.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.750
Hayley, are you drunk?

09:18.792 --> 09:20.917
Hey, I'm just doing
what you told me to do.

09:20.959 --> 09:22.125
I'm doing my job.

09:22.166 --> 09:23.417
Well,
maybe your mother's right.

09:23.458 --> 09:25.250
Maybe this isn't the healthiest
environment for you.

09:25.291 --> 09:26.333
You should quit.

09:26.375 --> 09:27.875
Hello.

09:29.917 --> 09:32.250
But you're clearly
too legit to quit.

09:32.291 --> 09:33.917
Hey, hey!

09:37.041 --> 09:39.166
Barkeep, line them up.

09:39.208 --> 09:41.166
Hayley, did I ever tell you

09:41.208 --> 09:45.333
about the time I murdered
the entire Bolshoi ballet?

09:45.375 --> 09:49.667
It was also the weekend
I discovered Crocs.

09:52.625 --> 09:54.875
♪ ♪

10:10.875 --> 10:13.125
♪ ♪

10:19.709 --> 10:21.959
♪ ♪

10:38.959 --> 10:40.166
And now I'd like to welcome

10:40.208 --> 10:42.583
the newest member
of our Inner Circle,

10:42.625 --> 10:44.458
Stan Smith.

10:46.500 --> 10:49.000
That means you're out,
Quackenbush.

10:50.875 --> 10:53.291
Well, we got the chair right.

10:53.333 --> 10:56.333
There's just the small matter
of the ceiling.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.792
Hayley?

11:07.834 --> 11:09.625
I knew this was
a mistake.

11:09.667 --> 11:11.000
Hayley, get up!

11:11.041 --> 11:13.834
I am showing Dad
I'm responsible.

11:14.875 --> 11:16.542
When did I eat vomit?

11:16.583 --> 11:18.583
Hayley, you have
a problem!

11:18.625 --> 11:20.166
Oh, you want
to go, bitch?

11:20.208 --> 11:21.458
Let's go!

11:23.000 --> 11:24.500
Ooh, shiny!

11:24.542 --> 11:27.041
Hey, that's
my badass Stingray!

11:27.083 --> 11:28.458
Hayley, are you okay?!

11:28.500 --> 11:29.458
Lucky she's drunk.

11:29.500 --> 11:31.000
When you're drunk,
your body goes limp

11:31.041 --> 11:33.625
so you don't get hurt
when you fall.
Really?

11:33.667 --> 11:36.125
Oh, yeah, that's how Gary Busey
did all his own stunts.

11:37.125 --> 11:40.458
Hayley, stop!
Please come back!

11:45.375 --> 11:48.208
Nice...
Nice...

11:54.583 --> 11:57.083
My bumper car's not working.

11:57.125 --> 11:58.333
Lucky you were drunk.

11:58.375 --> 12:00.125
When you're drunk,
your body goes limp

12:00.166 --> 12:02.083
and you don't get hurt
when you crash.

12:02.125 --> 12:03.041
Really?

12:03.083 --> 12:05.959
Yeah, that's how
I did my stunts.

12:09.875 --> 12:13.041
Hey, you stepped in
something, Quackenbush!

12:15.500 --> 12:16.500
Hello?

12:16.542 --> 12:18.291
Stan, Hayley's in rehab.

12:18.333 --> 12:20.500
Hayley's in rehab?! Hold on.

12:20.542 --> 12:21.792
I'm in the Inner Circle,

12:21.834 --> 12:23.375
Hayley's out of the house.

12:23.417 --> 12:24.458
There's no downside.

12:24.500 --> 12:25.834
Wait-- whose car did she crash?

12:25.875 --> 12:27.083
Roger's.
Great, bye.

12:27.125 --> 12:31.333
Rehab, eh?

12:33.792 --> 12:36.208
Hey, we'd like
to rent Das Boot.

12:36.250 --> 12:38.000
Whoa! That's so weird.

12:38.041 --> 12:39.542
Some orange dude
just came in here

12:39.583 --> 12:42.417
and rented
our last two copies.

12:43.625 --> 12:46.250
Klaus! We just wanted
to watch the movie

12:46.291 --> 12:49.125
without having to listen
to all your Germanic folktales.

12:49.166 --> 12:52.375
Yes, you two always try
to take the easy way out.

12:52.417 --> 12:56.291
Just like the story of
Die Krankenschwester
und Der Augenblick.

12:56.333 --> 12:57.625
What's that story?

12:57.667 --> 12:59.083
What?

12:59.125 --> 13:00.875
Stoner video clerk,

13:00.917 --> 13:02.667
you don't know
the story of

13:02.709 --> 13:05.041
Die Krankenschwester
und Der Augenblick?

13:06.625 --> 13:09.458
Bro. Bro, bro,
bro, bro...

13:09.500 --> 13:11.000
are you Nemo?

13:11.041 --> 13:13.959
People are looking
for you, bro.

13:17.166 --> 13:18.875
Attention, Inner Circle.

13:18.917 --> 13:21.208
Hayley Smith has
just entered rehab.

13:21.250 --> 13:22.375
This is her.

13:22.417 --> 13:24.000
She has classified intel.

13:24.041 --> 13:26.709
I have no idea
how she obtained it,

13:26.750 --> 13:28.667
but as part of her treatment,

13:28.709 --> 13:30.709
she'll no doubt be forced
to open up

13:30.750 --> 13:32.792
to a bunch
of loose-lipped drunks.

13:32.834 --> 13:35.667
Therefore,
she must be eliminated.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.250
Oh, right, Smith.

13:38.291 --> 13:40.792
Still not used to you being
in the Inner Circle.

13:42.083 --> 13:44.333
Of course we won't be
killing your daughter.

13:44.375 --> 13:46.333
Just a little joke there.

13:46.375 --> 13:49.458
But seriously, could
you leave the room?

13:49.500 --> 13:50.959
Uh... sure.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.667
No problem.

13:53.542 --> 13:55.417
I was joking
about joking.

13:55.500 --> 13:58.625
The killing of Hayley Smith
is very much on.

13:58.667 --> 14:01.208
I'll tell you what
else is still on...

14:01.250 --> 14:04.250
our afternoon
pants trading.

14:04.291 --> 14:06.291
Gentlemen?

14:07.667 --> 14:09.500
Can I get
your underpants, too?

14:09.542 --> 14:11.834
Mine are... kinda gross.

14:17.917 --> 14:19.000
I need to see my daughter!

14:19.041 --> 14:20.291
I'm sorry, sir,

14:20.333 --> 14:22.083
I'm afraid it's patients only
beyond this point.

14:22.125 --> 14:23.417
Oh, what am I
talking about?

14:23.458 --> 14:25.750
I don't have a daughter.
I'm drunk! I need help!

14:25.792 --> 14:27.583
There's no way I should
be behind the wheel!

14:27.625 --> 14:30.500
Listen to how I'm
slurring my words.

14:30.542 --> 14:32.625
Sir, that's
not convincing at all.

14:32.667 --> 14:34.583
I'm telling you,
I'm a menace!

14:34.625 --> 14:35.917
Argh!

14:36.000 --> 14:37.750
Sir, now you're
just doing a pirate.

14:37.792 --> 14:39.041
Damn it!

14:57.750 --> 14:58.834
That's it!

14:58.875 --> 15:01.625
Now get in there,
ya drunk son of a bitch!

15:05.166 --> 15:07.333
Hey, aren't you
The Most Interesting
Man in the World?

15:07.375 --> 15:08.667
What are you doing here?

15:08.709 --> 15:10.375
I don't always drink beer,

15:10.417 --> 15:13.417
but when I do,
I drink to excess.

15:13.458 --> 15:15.542
Dad?
Hayley?

15:15.583 --> 15:17.208
Oh, my God!
I just remembered
why I'm here!

15:17.250 --> 15:20.291
Oh, good. Then perhaps you could
share it with the rest of us.

15:20.333 --> 15:22.083
Dr. Penguin?
What are you doing here?

15:22.083 --> 15:23.291
I run this group.

15:23.333 --> 15:24.959
I've had my own issues
with substance abuse,

15:25.000 --> 15:27.291
and the cash I make
from this gig helps me

15:27.333 --> 15:28.500
to continue to have them.

15:28.542 --> 15:31.000
So... Stan,
why are you here?

15:31.041 --> 15:33.625
Because my daughter knows all
these secrets about the CIA,

15:33.667 --> 15:35.500
and they're sending people
to have her killed!

15:35.542 --> 15:36.959
What?
That's right!

15:37.000 --> 15:37.959
We have to get you
out of here!

15:38.000 --> 15:40.583
Stan, look at me.
Why are you here?

15:40.625 --> 15:41.542
I just told you!

15:41.583 --> 15:44.375
Stan...
why are you here?

15:49.333 --> 15:50.542
Because I'm no good.

15:50.583 --> 15:53.125
I pushed my daughter
to become a drunk

15:53.166 --> 15:55.667
just so I could
get ahead at work.

15:55.709 --> 15:57.750
And I didn't even prepare
her for life.

15:57.792 --> 15:59.625
She can't even take care
of herself!

15:59.709 --> 16:03.583
I'm a terrible father!

16:03.625 --> 16:05.709
There we go.

16:05.750 --> 16:07.750
Dad, that's not true.

16:07.792 --> 16:09.375
You're a great father.

16:09.417 --> 16:12.125
Oh, you're just saying that
because you're so stupid.

16:13.417 --> 16:14.542
See, people?

16:14.583 --> 16:16.792
We're all about
breaking down walls here.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.250
Go, go, go!

16:19.291 --> 16:20.834
No, stop, stop, stop!

16:20.875 --> 16:24.125
Tell me, friend,
how did breaking down
that wall make you feel?

16:24.166 --> 16:26.458
Sir, I don't have time for...

16:30.250 --> 16:34.166
If only I could have broken down
the wall between me and my ex,

16:34.208 --> 16:36.792
I might still see my kids!

16:38.166 --> 16:39.125
Oh, God.

16:39.166 --> 16:41.834
They call Ron "Dad".

16:41.875 --> 16:44.125
This is good.
This is healthy.

16:44.166 --> 16:45.542
I'm creating
a connection.

16:45.583 --> 16:46.709
And a diversion.

16:46.750 --> 16:48.917
Run, you idiot!

16:48.959 --> 16:52.834
♪ ♪

17:02.458 --> 17:03.750
This way!

17:09.959 --> 17:11.083
Hayley, what did you do?

17:11.125 --> 17:12.166
We have nowhere to go!

17:12.208 --> 17:14.542
Yes, we do.
We're gonna drink this,

17:14.583 --> 17:16.083
and then we're gonna
jump off the roof,

17:16.125 --> 17:18.333
but we're gonna be fine,
because our bodies'll go limp.

17:18.375 --> 17:19.667
This is a terrible idea.

17:19.709 --> 17:22.875
Drink, drink,
drink, drink, drink!

17:24.875 --> 17:27.542
This was, this was
a great idea!

17:27.583 --> 17:29.542
I know, right?

17:36.917 --> 17:39.125
Ooh, grab-grab that cab.

17:43.750 --> 17:45.750
Hey, so what's the
craziest thing you ever...

17:45.792 --> 17:47.792
has ever happened
in this cab?

17:47.834 --> 17:50.375
So-so how many
hours did...? Sir?

17:50.417 --> 17:53.125
How many, how long ago
when your shift...?

18:00.625 --> 18:02.291
Did the cabbie survive?

18:02.333 --> 18:06.333
No. The damn fool
was driving sober!

18:07.792 --> 18:09.959
We gotta find
a place to hide!

18:10.000 --> 18:11.375
We-we need a parade.

18:11.417 --> 18:12.875
When-when's
Chinese New Year?

18:12.917 --> 18:15.583
Or we could just go
in that Dumpster.

18:20.792 --> 18:22.709
Mmm, do you smell that?

18:22.750 --> 18:25.333
Oh, my God,
this must be the Dumpster

18:25.375 --> 18:27.625
for a pancake house.

18:28.625 --> 18:30.750
Mmm. How good are these?

18:30.792 --> 18:31.959
So... good.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.583
Oh, my God, I had...

18:33.625 --> 18:35.375
My friend went
to Vegas once,

18:35.417 --> 18:37.291
and he said
that he has found,

18:37.333 --> 18:41.125
he found a place with, that has,
like, the best pancakes.

18:43.083 --> 18:45.583
Hey, it's the guys
from your office!

18:45.625 --> 18:47.500
Oh, right!

18:50.875 --> 18:53.125
Leave it!
We don't have time!

19:01.000 --> 19:02.750
You know what's crazy?

19:02.792 --> 19:06.333
This already happened
for people in Europe.

19:09.375 --> 19:10.709
We're trapped!

19:10.750 --> 19:12.333
I'm really scared.

19:12.375 --> 19:15.375
See, this is why you should
never eat lobsters.

19:15.417 --> 19:16.750
Why?

19:16.792 --> 19:20.583
'Cause-'cause they get,
they get caught in a trap.

19:20.625 --> 19:23.041
I'm sorry it had
to come to this, Smith.

19:23.083 --> 19:24.709
All right, Hayley,
where do you want it?

19:24.750 --> 19:26.667
In the face.
Yeah!

19:26.709 --> 19:29.917
But before you do this,
you might be interested

19:29.959 --> 19:33.333
to know that I wrote down
all those dirty little secrets

19:33.375 --> 19:35.333
that you told me at the bar:

19:35.375 --> 19:39.000
the Nepal slaughter,
the Copenhagen incident,

19:39.041 --> 19:41.083
the nuclear war in Chicago.

19:41.125 --> 19:43.041
We can't let that get out!

19:43.083 --> 19:46.500
It's all in a manila envelope
with strict instructions

19:46.542 --> 19:48.333
that if anything happens to me,

19:48.375 --> 19:52.250
it will be released to every
major newspaper in America!

19:52.291 --> 19:53.166
So?

19:53.208 --> 19:54.208
And to the Internet.

19:58.709 --> 20:01.041
Well played,
young Smith.

20:01.083 --> 20:02.625
As for you, old Smith,

20:02.667 --> 20:04.500
you're out
of the Inner Circle.

20:04.542 --> 20:06.875
Please forget
the Wi-Fi password.

20:08.792 --> 20:10.375
That was amazing!

20:10.417 --> 20:12.959
Hayley, do you realize
what this means?

20:13.000 --> 20:16.125
It means you can
take care of yourself!

20:16.166 --> 20:18.208
You're gonna be just
fine after all!

20:18.250 --> 20:19.417
I told you!

20:19.458 --> 20:21.125
Ah, button-nose.

20:22.208 --> 20:23.625
You ready to go home?

20:23.667 --> 20:25.000
You bet.

20:34.166 --> 20:35.792
Hi, I'm Nicholas
Vanderbilt,

20:35.834 --> 20:37.291
the actor who plays
Stan Smith.

20:37.333 --> 20:39.417
And I'm Kate Fagan,
aka Hayley.

20:39.458 --> 20:40.875
You know, we've had
some fun tonight

20:40.917 --> 20:42.709
suggesting drunken people
are less likely

20:42.750 --> 20:44.625
to be injured
in falls and crashes.

20:44.667 --> 20:46.917
The dark reality is
that alcohol makes

20:46.959 --> 20:49.500
each of these far more
likely... and deadly.

20:49.542 --> 20:51.625
So, please, if you're going
to crash a car

20:51.709 --> 20:53.834
or jump off a building,
do it sober.

20:53.875 --> 20:54.875
Hang in there.

20:54.875 --> 20:56.750
You are loved and
you are special.

20:56.792 --> 20:58.000
Good night.

21:07.500 --> 21:08.834
That was amazing!

21:08.875 --> 21:10.250
And so much more
meaningful

21:10.291 --> 21:11.834
with all the
cultural references.

21:11.875 --> 21:12.917
I told you.

21:12.959 --> 21:15.500
There's only one thing
I don't understand.

21:15.542 --> 21:17.500
Why were they all fighting
in the first place?

21:17.542 --> 21:19.583
Yeah. What-what was
that all about?

21:19.625 --> 21:22.000
What? You don't know why

21:22.041 --> 21:25.667
the Americans and Germans were
fighting in World War II?

21:28.542 --> 21:30.166
Nobody knows.

21:30.208 --> 21:32.083
Bye! Have a beautiful time.
