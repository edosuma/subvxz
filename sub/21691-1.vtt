Karen:
<i> Hey, Dean, it's mom.</i>

03:24.972 --> 03:27.239
<i> I just wanted to tell you</i>
<i> your dad and I had</i>

03:27.241 --> 03:30.242
<i> the best time with you</i>
<i> and Michelle last night.</i>

03:30.244 --> 03:32.778
<i> It was so fun visiting</i>
<i> you guys in Brooklyn.</i>

03:32.780 --> 03:36.215
<i> Anyway, I'll talk to you soon</i>
<i> and love you, bye.</i>

03:39.320 --> 03:40.786

Robert: <i> Hi, it's your dad.</i>

03:42.389 --> 03:45.224
<i> I'm, uh, hoping you're alive.</i>

03:45.226 --> 03:49.261
<i> If so, call me because</i>
<i> I have some important news.</i>

03:49.263 --> 03:52.231
Voice mail: <i> Message erased.</i>

Dean: <i> My father's always been</i>
<i> full of important news.</i>

03:55.002 --> 03:57.269
<i> This week's important news?</i>

03:58.806 --> 04:00.839
<i> He got a new pair of jeans.</i>

04:02.809 --> 04:05.010
<i> Dad's an engineer,</i>
<i> so, to him,</i>

04:05.012 --> 04:08.413
<i> life is basically a series</i>
<i> of problems to be solved,</i>

04:08.415 --> 04:11.450
<i> and his approach to grieving</i>
<i> has been no exception.</i>

04:11.452 --> 04:14.820
<i> Thanks to his therapist, Tim,</i>
<i> dad is taking walks,</i>

04:14.822 --> 04:17.822
<i> reading books,</i>
<i> watching DVDs.</i>

04:17.825 --> 04:20.926
<i> Everything is about taking</i>
<i> productive steps forward</i>

04:20.928 --> 04:22.794
<i> even if he isn't</i>
<i> totally ready.</i>

04:22.796 --> 04:25.564
And this dinosaur
no longer roams the earth.

04:25.566 --> 04:27.866
- Really? Since when?
- About eight years ago.

04:29.302 --> 04:31.536
I can set you up with basically
an updated version of that

04:31.538 --> 04:32.971
which is this one right here.

04:32.973 --> 04:35.307
- Do you watch TV?
- Yeah, I watch TV.

04:35.309 --> 04:37.809
You can watch TV
on the phone.

04:37.811 --> 04:39.778
I'll just watch it
on my TV.

04:43.816 --> 04:45.984
Dean: <i> I, on the other hand,</i>
<i> have been focusing less</i>

04:45.986 --> 04:49.554
<i> on moving forward</i>
<i> and more on</i>

04:49.556 --> 04:52.357
<i> just sitting around,</i>

04:52.359 --> 04:53.792
<i> thinking.</i>

04:54.894 --> 04:57.296
<i> Work hasn't been going</i>
<i> too well, either.</i>

04:57.298 --> 04:59.364
<i> I just missed</i>
<i> the third official</i>

04:59.366 --> 05:01.466
<i> final deadline for my book.</i>

05:01.468 --> 05:03.969
<i> My first book</i>
<i> did pretty well, actually.</i>

05:03.971 --> 05:06.571
<i> One critic said it was,</i>
<i> quote, "full of whimsy."</i>

05:06.573 --> 05:08.073
<i> I'll take it.</i>

05:08.075 --> 05:09.508
<i> I'm excited about</i>
<i> the new book,</i>

05:09.510 --> 05:10.876
<i> but, I don't know,</i>

05:10.878 --> 05:12.878
<i> I guess I've just hit a wall.</i>

05:12.880 --> 05:14.880
<i> It's not that I can't come up</i>
<i> with new drawings,</i>

05:14.882 --> 05:17.582
<i> it's more that they all seem</i>
<i> to be about one subject.</i>

05:21.521 --> 05:23.555
<i> On top of that,</i>
<i> an uninvited guest</i>

05:23.557 --> 05:25.924
<i> has started to show up</i>
<i> in my work.</i>

05:25.926 --> 05:28.327
<i> And he won't seem to leave.</i>

05:32.498 --> 05:35.534
<i> Meanwhile, dad has now</i>
<i> entered what seems to be</i>

05:35.536 --> 05:38.470
<i> some sort of cross-training</i>
<i> phase of grief.</i>

05:40.907 --> 05:43.608
<i> I can't say I understand</i>
<i> what he's doing,</i>

05:43.610 --> 05:45.410
<i> but we've never really</i>
<i> understood each other,</i>

05:45.412 --> 05:46.945
<i> so why start now?</i>

05:51.117 --> 05:52.617
When are you gonna get
a haircut?

05:52.619 --> 05:54.486
I have not seen
your forehead in 15 years.

05:54.488 --> 05:56.621
- With the hair again?
- You're living in the '60s.

05:58.925 --> 06:01.960
What is that?
Are those the '60s?

06:01.962 --> 06:03.929
- Yeah.
- Oh.

06:03.931 --> 06:05.430
- It's done.
- I'm in a conga line,

06:05.432 --> 06:06.531
and I'm playing
a slide whistle.

06:06.533 --> 06:07.933
That wasn't a conga line.

06:07.935 --> 06:09.434
I was doing
the hare krishna thing.

06:09.436 --> 06:11.403
- Looks like a conga line.
- I see.

06:13.539 --> 06:16.541
Look, I'm--

06:16.543 --> 06:19.111
I'm going to talk to you
about, uh, some news.

06:19.113 --> 06:22.414
Mm-hmm?

06:22.416 --> 06:25.584
I'm gonna sell the house.

06:25.586 --> 06:28.453
- What are you talking about?
- I'm selling the house.

06:28.455 --> 06:31.656
You're just out of the blue
gonna sell our house?

06:31.658 --> 06:33.425
It's not out of the blue.

06:33.427 --> 06:36.428
I've given it
some thought, okay?

06:36.430 --> 06:38.630
I can't live there.
It's ridiculous.

06:38.632 --> 06:40.432
It makes no sense for me
to stay there.

06:40.434 --> 06:42.000
- It's too big.
- It's too big?

06:44.103 --> 06:45.570
- Yeah.
- Could you just, like,

06:45.572 --> 06:46.938
not use all the rooms
or something?

06:46.940 --> 06:48.540
Maybe you could, like,
i don't know,

06:48.542 --> 06:50.575
cover up the furniture in some
of the rooms with sheets.

06:50.577 --> 06:54.413
- Just don't go in there.
- Wha-- like I'm a countess?

06:54.415 --> 06:57.115
I don't know.
I just think this is hasty.

06:57.117 --> 06:59.050
You know,
we need to talk about this.

06:59.052 --> 07:00.185
I grew up there.

07:00.187 --> 07:01.653
I don't wanna just
sell our house.

07:01.655 --> 07:04.723
- Dean, it--

07:07.994 --> 07:10.095
oh, my god,
that's my phone.

07:10.097 --> 07:12.130
That's my new phone.
Sorry.

07:12.132 --> 07:13.899
Here we go.

07:13.901 --> 07:16.034
Um, I can't talk now.

07:16.036 --> 07:19.004
I'm with my son.
You see, I'm busy?

07:19.006 --> 07:21.473
It can't see you.
It's more of a voice thing.

07:21.475 --> 07:23.608
Oh, you think it can't see me?
Yeah, dream on.

07:23.610 --> 07:26.044
They know what's going on
at the other end of this thing.

07:26.046 --> 07:27.479
- There.

07:27.481 --> 07:28.213
Oh! I just took a picture
of my sandwich.

07:28.215 --> 07:29.614
Okay, hang on.
Hang on.

07:29.616 --> 07:31.149
Come on.

07:31.151 --> 07:33.452
Oh, good.

07:33.454 --> 07:35.754
- Smooth.
- You know, speaking of Tim,

07:35.756 --> 07:37.622
I really think you should
give him another chance.

07:37.624 --> 07:39.658
- He's really helped me a lot.
- I appreciate it, dad,

07:39.660 --> 07:42.527
but I'm more of, like,
a self-help kind of guy

07:42.529 --> 07:45.764
- than the guidance
and the exercises and...
- Yeah.

07:45.766 --> 07:47.132
The books and all that stuff,

07:47.134 --> 07:48.500
it's just--
that doesn't help me.

07:48.502 --> 07:50.035
- Mm-hmm.
- You know--

07:50.037 --> 07:51.636
and Michelle,
that's got nothing to do with

07:51.638 --> 07:52.971
losing your mom?

07:52.973 --> 07:55.540
It's more complicated
than that.

07:55.542 --> 07:58.210
I always liked Michelle.
You guys were good together.

07:58.212 --> 08:00.245
Yeah, I know.

08:00.247 --> 08:01.680
You should see us
apart, though.

08:01.682 --> 08:03.081
We're really great.

08:09.255 --> 08:11.056
- I don't need it back.

08:11.058 --> 08:13.158
I don't want it back.
It's yours.

08:13.160 --> 08:14.993
- Tell me, what am i
supposed to do with it?
- Do what you want with it.

08:14.995 --> 08:17.095
You can put it on a bracelet
maybe like as a charm?

08:17.097 --> 08:19.264
Oh, wow.

08:19.266 --> 08:20.699
Why don't we think of it
as a keepsake?

08:20.701 --> 08:23.034
Oh, yeah, that's a great idea.
"Oh, this?

08:23.036 --> 08:24.736
This is just my former
engagement ring.

08:24.738 --> 08:27.072
Oh, well, see,
when I got un-proposed to,

08:27.074 --> 08:29.074
I decided to turn it
into a charm."

08:29.076 --> 08:31.209
- Okay.
- "So I could always remember
that time I didn't get married."

08:31.211 --> 08:32.677
That's a really great idea.

08:32.679 --> 08:34.746
I did not
unpropose to you.

08:34.748 --> 08:36.681
Our relationship...

08:36.683 --> 08:39.150
Kind of eroded over time.

08:39.784 --> 08:41.753
Like...

08:41.755 --> 08:42.787
Like a coastline.

08:42.789 --> 08:45.790
Or, like, some rocks.

08:45.792 --> 08:49.094
So... I'm sand?

08:52.598 --> 08:54.299
We both are,

08:54.301 --> 08:56.067
if you think about it.

08:59.105 --> 09:02.574
Dean: <i> Never speak of a woman</i>
<i> in geological terms.</i>

09:02.576 --> 09:05.110
<i> That was Brett's takeaway</i>
<i> from the whole relationship.</i>

09:05.112 --> 09:06.711
<i> This was the kind of advice</i>
<i> that comes from a man</i>

09:06.713 --> 09:08.713
<i> who had recently</i>
<i> walked into scaffolding</i>

09:08.715 --> 09:10.849
<i>because he was googling himself</i>
<i> on his new face gear.</i>

09:10.851 --> 09:12.183
Can you take those things off,
by the way?

09:12.185 --> 09:13.818
- I just-- I can't.
- These?

09:13.820 --> 09:16.021
- Yeah.
- Why?

09:16.023 --> 09:17.556
They're so comfortable.
It's the--

09:17.558 --> 09:18.823
I feel like
you're flying something.

09:18.825 --> 09:20.559
Just take them off.

09:20.561 --> 09:22.260
Dean: <i> Miraculously,</i>
<i> Brett is getting married,</i>

09:22.262 --> 09:24.696
<i> and I'm gonna be</i>
<i> his best man.</i>

09:24.698 --> 09:26.831
<i> Well, one of them.</i>

09:26.833 --> 09:29.601
<i> The other one is Kevin,</i>

09:29.603 --> 09:31.636
<i> his new business partner</i>

09:31.638 --> 09:33.338
<i> who I guess needs</i>
<i> a best friend or something</i>

09:33.340 --> 09:35.140
<i> 'cause he's moving in on mine.</i>

09:35.142 --> 09:37.576
<i> Anyway, I'm really happy</i>
<i> for Brett.</i>

09:37.578 --> 09:39.144
<i> His fianc√©e's great.</i>

09:39.146 --> 09:39.144
<i> They're getting a new place</i>
<i> on the upper West Side,</i>

09:39.146 --> 09:43.682
<i> and, you know, his life</i>
<i> is really coming together.</i>

09:45.785 --> 09:47.152
<i> And me?</i>

09:47.154 --> 09:49.254
<i> Well, yesterday I drew this.</i>

09:52.124 --> 09:55.660
Truth is, I don't know
if I've ever met anyone else
who's quite like Michelle.

09:55.662 --> 09:58.296
Maybe I made a mistake,
you know?

09:58.298 --> 10:00.165
Maybe we should give it
another shot.

10:00.167 --> 10:02.167
- I don't know.
- What are you talking about?

10:02.169 --> 10:04.636
- We had a lot of good memories.
- Whoa, whoa, stop.

10:04.638 --> 10:06.738
Look at me.
Focus.

10:06.740 --> 10:09.741
You need to take some time alone
to deal with some things.

10:09.743 --> 10:11.676
- I am alone.
- Well, all the stuff that you

10:11.678 --> 10:13.178
and your dad are going
through right now,

10:13.180 --> 10:14.879
the answer's not a woman,
Dean.

10:14.881 --> 10:17.115
It's you.

10:17.117 --> 10:19.384
Yeah.

10:19.386 --> 10:20.719
You just read that
off the Internet?

10:20.721 --> 10:22.387
Yeah, just now.
You like that?

10:22.389 --> 10:24.889
- Yeah, very wise.
- Thank you very much, yeah.

10:24.891 --> 10:26.725
Wise guy.

10:42.141 --> 10:43.908
- Robert: Ah, uh, Patrick?
- Patrick: Yes.

10:43.910 --> 10:45.810
- Robert? Yes, yes, hi.
- Yes? Yeah, good.

10:45.812 --> 10:47.145
- Nice to meet you.
- Good to meet you in person.

10:47.147 --> 10:48.813
- Hey, uh, this is Carol.
- Oh.

10:48.815 --> 10:51.149
Carol: Sorry, I was just
checking out your veranda.

10:51.151 --> 10:52.350
Oh, fantastic.
Good. Hi.

10:52.352 --> 10:53.785
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

10:53.787 --> 10:55.820
- Nice to meet you.
- Carol, it is?

10:55.822 --> 10:57.255
- Carol, yes.
- Carol, okay.

10:57.257 --> 10:58.890
Well, this is it.

10:58.892 --> 11:01.693
This is the whole.
This is the, uh...

11:01.695 --> 11:05.130
- This is the family room.
- Carol: Oh, uh...

11:05.132 --> 11:06.831
- Patrick: Carol.
- Carol: No, i--

11:06.833 --> 11:09.701
sometimes I react without--
but--

11:09.703 --> 11:12.237
- no, no.
- No, this is a great house.

11:12.239 --> 11:15.240
I've kind of let it
get away from me a bit.

11:15.242 --> 11:17.242
Perhaps for the open house
we could do

11:17.244 --> 11:20.879
- with a little bit of staging.
- Yeah, maybe a new sofa?

11:20.881 --> 11:22.914
- Oh.
- Carol: Definitely a new sofa.

11:22.916 --> 11:24.983
- Okay.
- Cat?

11:24.985 --> 11:27.686
Robert: Oh, no, that's--
that's my son.

11:27.688 --> 11:29.454
My son, yeah.
He's, uh,

11:29.456 --> 11:32.891
he's an adult now,
at least numerically,

11:32.893 --> 11:34.459
and completely housetrained.

11:34.461 --> 11:35.860
- Oh.
- That's great.

11:35.862 --> 11:38.263
It's like my nephew.

11:38.265 --> 11:40.331
My sister's got him
on one of those leashes,

11:40.333 --> 11:41.933
which I'm sure

11:41.935 --> 11:44.803
is not gonna add
to any weird issues later on.

11:44.805 --> 11:46.337
Oh, yeah.

11:46.339 --> 11:48.907
But he's really good
at chasing balls.

11:48.909 --> 11:51.810
- Patrick: Does he live nearby?
- Robert: Uh...

11:51.812 --> 11:54.713
- Patrick: Your son?
- Robert: No, uh, yeah,
he's in Brooklyn now.

11:54.715 --> 11:57.949
No, but I work in the city,
so I see him whenever
he needs something.

11:57.951 --> 12:01.953
- So you live here alone?
- Yes, uh, since my wife died.

12:01.955 --> 12:03.354
It's just me.

12:03.356 --> 12:06.725
- Oh, I'm sorry, Robert.
- No, no, it's okay.

12:06.727 --> 12:08.960
I've got a terrific therapist.

12:08.962 --> 12:11.029
I'm reading all the books
you're supposed to read, so...

12:12.898 --> 12:18.002
- Yeah, there you go.
- Let me just, uh,
show you the kitchen.

12:18.004 --> 12:20.438
Uh, hold my calls.

12:20.440 --> 12:22.373
This way.

13:34.413 --> 13:36.314
Man, I haven't seen you
in a long time.

13:36.316 --> 13:39.384
Yeah, I got to fly
all the way to Brett's wedding
to see my friend?

13:39.386 --> 13:41.820
- What the hell is that?
- I know.

13:41.822 --> 13:44.989
You have got to be
the oldest ring bearer
I've ever seen in my life.

13:44.991 --> 13:47.559
Yeah, I'm not the ring bearer.
I'm the best man, but...

13:47.561 --> 13:49.394
Sorry you didn't make
the cut, buddy.

13:50.496 --> 13:53.898
I'm pretty sure Kevin
was the best man, right?

13:53.900 --> 13:55.133
Yeah, he's one of them.

13:55.135 --> 13:57.836
There are two of us,
so it was kind of a tie.

13:57.838 --> 13:59.404
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

13:59.406 --> 14:01.940
So you were
the second-best man?

14:01.942 --> 14:04.475
- Okay.
- No, I'm best-also.

14:04.477 --> 14:07.111
Brett has two best men.
We're both his best men.

14:09.014 --> 14:10.882
It just looked like
Kevin was standing

14:10.884 --> 14:10.882
- closer to Brett...
- Okay, dude, listen.

14:10.884 --> 14:13.852
- We're both--
- I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

14:13.854 --> 14:16.354
- Joking around, just a bit.
- Oh, okay.

14:16.356 --> 14:18.156
- Thank you.
- Thanks, man.

14:18.158 --> 14:20.024
- You do bits now, huh?
- Yeah.

14:20.026 --> 14:21.893
Is that what they do
in Hollywood?
They do bits?

14:21.895 --> 14:24.462
Well, I don't live in Hollywood.
I live in echo park.

14:24.464 --> 14:27.165
Echo park?
That sounds very empty.

14:27.167 --> 14:28.132
You don't know
what you're missing, man.

14:28.134 --> 14:30.435
There are so many hot women,

14:30.437 --> 14:32.036
and a lot of them
are desperate,

14:32.038 --> 14:34.606
which is really nice.

14:34.608 --> 14:36.641
- You should come visit.
- Yeah, I don't know.

14:36.643 --> 14:36.641
Actually,
this ad agency out there,

14:36.643 --> 14:40.011
they wanna use my illustrations
in one of their campaigns.

14:40.013 --> 14:41.913
And they were like,
"hey, we'll fly you out,

14:41.915 --> 14:41.913
and you can do some concepting
with our creatives."

14:41.915 --> 14:46.451
- But I can't do it.
- That-- what, are you too busy?

14:46.453 --> 14:48.486
I just-- I can't bring myself
to work with people

14:48.488 --> 14:50.121
who call themselves
"creatives."

14:50.123 --> 14:51.656
Oh, you're a creative?

14:51.658 --> 14:53.191
Ah, you must be
very creative.

14:53.193 --> 14:55.159
I can tell by the name
you gave yourself.

14:55.161 --> 14:57.195
It's very creative.

14:57.197 --> 14:59.097
Hey, guys, photo,
come on.

14:59.099 --> 15:00.598
Oh, yeah.
Here we go.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.567
Come on, get in here.
All right.

15:02.569 --> 15:04.969
Just the roommates.
Ready?

15:04.971 --> 15:07.038
Oh, and Kevin.
Kev!

15:07.040 --> 15:07.038
- Get in here, man.
- No, come on, let's grab one.

15:07.040 --> 15:09.040
Let's grab one.
Let's grab one.

15:09.042 --> 15:10.475
- Come on.
- Yeah.

15:10.477 --> 15:12.010
- We got it. We got it.
- K-dog, get in here.

15:12.012 --> 15:13.378
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Ready? Ready?

15:13.380 --> 15:16.915
- One, two, three.

15:18.952 --> 15:20.051
- Brett: Love these things.
- That's awesome.

15:20.053 --> 15:21.486
- Hi, guys.
- Michelle, hey.

15:21.488 --> 15:22.687
- Hey, how are you?
- Hi, good to see you.

15:22.689 --> 15:24.489
- Good to see you.
- You look so handsome.

15:24.491 --> 15:24.489
- Thank you.
- You all do.

15:24.491 --> 15:26.190
- Thank you.
- Hi.

15:26.192 --> 15:28.559
Hey. Hey.

15:31.031 --> 15:33.064
Eric: How you holding up?

15:33.066 --> 15:34.432
- Brett: He's good, right?
- Yeah, I'm good, yeah.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.100
Michelle I'm more
worried about.

15:39.538 --> 15:42.941
Whew.
She is beautiful.

15:43.509 --> 15:46.511
- Until one of them gets fat.

15:46.513 --> 15:49.113
And that is how my boy Brett

15:49.115 --> 15:52.083
bagged that hottie you see
right next to him right now.

15:52.085 --> 15:54.052
They're one cute ass couple,
huh? No homo.

15:54.054 --> 15:55.520
No homo.

15:55.522 --> 15:58.022
Dad, you know what
I'm talking about.

15:58.024 --> 16:00.625
Seriously, though, man...

16:00.627 --> 16:02.593
You're my best bud.

16:02.595 --> 16:04.963
We're one the same.
Mano a mano.

16:05.998 --> 16:06.731
To Brett and Wendy.

16:09.635 --> 16:11.235
May you have a long
and happy marriage

16:11.237 --> 16:13.104
and an even longer
and happier life.

16:13.106 --> 16:14.572
Woman: Aww.

16:14.574 --> 16:14.572
Ladies and gentlemen,
your second-best man,

16:14.574 --> 16:18.242
- aka the ring dropper.

16:21.046 --> 16:23.014
- Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa.
- Oh, excuse me.

16:23.016 --> 16:24.749
- Excuse me.

16:27.152 --> 16:28.987
Okay, okay, hello, test.

16:31.558 --> 16:34.158
Thank you, Kevin, for that--
that heartfelt,

16:34.160 --> 16:36.561
uh, toast-slash-rap,
i guess that was?

16:36.563 --> 16:36.561
- Whatever you were doing.
- Ha-ha!

16:36.563 --> 16:40.732
By the way, I'm-- if anybody's
the actual best man tonight,

16:40.734 --> 16:42.266
you know, it's me.

16:42.268 --> 16:44.035
I've been friends with Brett
for a long time.

16:44.037 --> 16:46.070
We go way back.
We were roommates in college.

16:46.072 --> 16:48.573
He's my best friend.

16:48.575 --> 16:50.508
Um, he actually
met his wife, Wendy,

16:50.510 --> 16:53.144
through me and my ex,

16:53.146 --> 16:55.146
who's here tonight,
Michelle.

16:55.148 --> 16:57.548
She's brought her friend.
Hey, man, cheers.

16:57.550 --> 17:00.018
Uh, which I'm totally
fine with.

17:00.020 --> 17:01.285
Good-good
seeing you guys.

17:01.287 --> 17:03.488
Anyways, the point is
it's not a competition.

17:03.490 --> 17:05.089
We're all here to have fun.

17:05.090 --> 17:07.724
Just wanted to clear the air
a little bit, um...

17:07.727 --> 17:10.595
Kevin: Jesus Christ.

17:10.597 --> 17:13.064
- Are we okay?
- Are we? I don't know.

17:13.066 --> 17:15.199
You did your thing,
whatever that was, and...

17:15.201 --> 17:17.300
- Oh, yeah.
- I'm gonna try to say something

17:17.303 --> 17:19.103
- actually from the heart here.
- Wrap it up.

17:19.105 --> 17:21.638
Yeah, wrap it up.
Is that with a "w" or an "r"?

17:21.641 --> 17:23.241
What'd you just say?

17:24.609 --> 17:27.811
It's a play on words.
There's homonyms or homophones.

17:27.814 --> 17:30.581
- You just call me a homophobe?
- Hold on, hold on.

17:30.583 --> 17:31.749
Hey, kev.

17:31.751 --> 17:34.552
- Hey, you got a problem?

17:34.554 --> 17:35.820
- Brett: Come on.
- Kevin: Right now!

17:35.822 --> 17:37.822
- You want to go with me?
- Man: Come on, guys.

17:37.824 --> 17:38.756
Kevin: You want to go with me?
You know what? Forget it.

17:38.758 --> 17:40.625
Forget it. Forget it.

17:42.227 --> 17:44.195
I'm good.
I'm fine.

17:45.230 --> 17:47.765
Come on, it's a party.
Let's-- let's have a good time.

18:05.651 --> 18:08.119
- Hey, dad.
- I can't believe you picked up.

18:08.121 --> 18:10.755
- Yeah, what's going on?
- Listen, we need to get rid

18:10.757 --> 18:13.791
of some things to make
the house more... sellable.

18:13.793 --> 18:13.791
So I need you to come up

18:13.793 --> 18:17.795
<i> and clear out some</i>
<i> of your stuff from your room.</i>

18:17.797 --> 18:19.664
Wait, what are you
talking about?

18:19.666 --> 18:22.166
<i> I've been asking you to clear</i>
<i> that stuff out for years.</i>

18:22.168 --> 18:25.269
You know, your stuff.
All your...

18:25.271 --> 18:27.138
Detritus.

18:27.140 --> 18:28.739
I think we should
just talk about

18:28.741 --> 18:30.374
what we're gonna
do with the house.

18:30.376 --> 18:32.677
We haven't made a decision yet.

18:32.679 --> 18:34.278
Right?
We have to decide together.

18:35.347 --> 18:38.683
- How's Friday?
- What, to decide?

18:38.685 --> 18:41.219
-<i> Mm-hmm.</i>
- Oh, yeah,

18:41.221 --> 18:43.221
I can't do Friday.

18:43.223 --> 18:45.289
- Why?
-<i> Well, because</i>
<i> I'm swamped with my book.</i>

18:45.291 --> 18:46.657
In fact, I was just
working on it now.

18:46.659 --> 18:48.659
I'm really busy.

18:48.661 --> 18:48.659
<i> Okay, no, no. No, no.</i>

18:48.661 --> 18:52.597
We'll just leave it like this,
and then you'll be happy

18:52.599 --> 18:54.599
to know it will never be sold.

18:54.601 --> 18:54.599
Dad, come on.
That's not what I'm saying.

18:54.601 --> 18:56.868
I'm saying let's...

18:56.870 --> 18:59.904
Talk about it
and make a decision together.

18:59.906 --> 19:01.372
All right, how about Saturday?

19:01.374 --> 19:02.807
Yeah, Saturday's bad, too.

19:02.809 --> 19:05.176
I'm not available.

19:05.178 --> 19:06.878
Okay, well,
what are you doing,

19:06.880 --> 19:08.713
if you don't mind my asking?

19:08.715 --> 19:11.449
Um, I'm, uh...

19:14.353 --> 19:15.720
I'm, uh...

19:19.425 --> 19:21.792
I'm going away, actually.

19:21.794 --> 19:23.394
I'm going to California...

19:24.730 --> 19:26.397
To meet with some creatives.

20:36.802 --> 20:39.837
Trevor: Yup, it's all good.
It's all good.

20:40.839 --> 20:43.374
All right, see you.

20:44.276 --> 20:47.345
Yes, I love it. Love you.
Love it. All right.

20:47.347 --> 20:49.013
Peace.

20:49.015 --> 20:51.816
Sorry about that.
Just making money.

20:51.818 --> 20:53.818
- There he is.
- What up?

20:53.820 --> 20:55.419
This is Chad.
He's our co-creative director.

20:55.421 --> 20:56.520
What's up, brother?
How are you?

20:56.522 --> 20:57.888
How you doing?

20:57.890 --> 20:59.724
You want some
almond water, bro?

20:59.726 --> 21:01.859
- Uh, no, I'm allergic.
- You're allergic to water?

21:01.861 --> 21:03.027
No, to almonds.

21:04.496 --> 21:06.897
Huh, nuts.

21:07.366 --> 21:08.766
Yeah.

21:10.402 --> 21:13.437
Okay, so I don't know how much
you know about appar@us.

21:13.439 --> 21:15.406
Uh, a little bit.
I checked out your website.

21:15.408 --> 21:17.441
Appar@us is a creative company,

21:17.443 --> 21:18.943
and what we're doing
is building

21:18.945 --> 21:18.943
- a digital audience, okay?

21:18.945 --> 21:21.812
- Yeah.
- Basically, we sprinkle our

21:21.814 --> 21:24.315
- love of good storytelling...

21:24.317 --> 21:27.018
...into brand management,
brand entertainment,

21:27.020 --> 21:29.320
loyalty branding,
and what we're doing is

21:29.322 --> 21:29.320
- building a digital audience.

21:29.322 --> 21:33.858
We've won awards from cannes,
one show, best show.

21:33.860 --> 21:36.861
We won a couple clios,
omma awards, webbys,

21:36.863 --> 21:39.497
and some from ad age,
digital age, digital ad age.

21:39.499 --> 21:41.465
- - Oh, uh-oh.

21:44.003 --> 21:46.070
Both: Wow.

21:47.339 --> 21:49.040
Trevor: This is great.

21:57.015 --> 21:59.583
That moment you land
a huge account.

22:01.487 --> 22:03.421
- Congrats. That's awesome.
- Trevor: Thank you so much.

22:03.423 --> 22:04.889
Yeah, it's a blessing.

22:04.891 --> 22:07.024
So let me cut to the chase.
We like your drawings.

22:07.026 --> 22:10.528
They're, um...
They're simple.

22:10.530 --> 22:13.030
- It's like a kid did them.
- Trevor: It's insane.

22:13.032 --> 22:13.030
Yeah, and we want to use
your drawings

22:13.032 --> 22:17.034
for this new viral campaign
that we've got.

22:17.036 --> 22:19.503
- It's body spray.
- It's gonna be epic.

22:19.505 --> 22:21.372
Directly targeted
at tween boys.

22:21.374 --> 22:25.076
We're gonna use your drawings
for our hero, so to speak,

22:25.078 --> 22:27.878
although he's definitely
not a hero.

22:27.880 --> 22:29.914
- He's a nerd.
- Total loser, you know?

22:29.916 --> 22:31.582
No friends at all,
spends all his time alone,

22:31.584 --> 22:33.951
just drawing in his little
notebook or whatever.

22:33.953 --> 22:35.986
He's got his dick in his hand.

22:35.988 --> 22:37.822
Yeah,
but then check this out.

22:37.824 --> 22:39.590
With the help
of blade boy body spray...

22:39.592 --> 22:41.459
- Mm-hmm.
- ...He gets
all these "shorties"

22:41.461 --> 22:43.928
on his jock
like flies on shit,

22:43.930 --> 22:46.597
and he absolutely
transformifies,

22:46.599 --> 22:49.934
and so do his doodles.

22:49.936 --> 22:52.937
Chad: We already hired
this other dope artist

22:52.939 --> 22:54.839
for those drawings
that he was talking about,

22:54.841 --> 22:56.440
- so that--
- yeah, he's gonna do sort of,

22:56.442 --> 22:57.875
- the badass ones, when, like...
- Uh-huh.

22:57.877 --> 23:00.010
...the transformation
takes place, okay?

23:00.012 --> 23:01.645
He's from Japan.

23:01.647 --> 23:03.047
Trevor:
And those are gonna be insane.
They're awesome.

23:03.049 --> 23:03.047
Chad: We already
locked him up for those.

23:03.049 --> 23:05.850
Can you guys just...
Excuse me for a second?

23:05.852 --> 23:07.885
Just for one second, thanks.
Thank you.

23:07.887 --> 23:10.020
- Thanks. I'm sorry.
- What's up?

23:13.959 --> 23:16.927
All right, well,
we'll just copy his style.

23:16.929 --> 23:18.662
Cool. I'll just get Nick
to do it.

23:18.664 --> 23:19.897
- That's chill.
- All right.

23:22.968 --> 23:25.469
Voice mail: <i> First voice message.</i>

23:25.471 --> 23:27.104
Eric: <i> Dean, what up?</i>
<i> It's, uh, Eric.</i>

23:27.106 --> 23:29.039
<i> Love that you're in L.A.,</i>
<i> I can't hang out tonight</i>

23:29.041 --> 23:29.039
<i> 'cause I'm doing something</i>
<i> with my roommate Nicholas,</i>

23:29.041 --> 23:32.543
<i> but I can definitely</i>
<i> hang out tomorrow night,</i>

23:32.545 --> 23:34.445
<i> and we definitely should.</i>

23:34.447 --> 23:35.980
<i> Love you, dude.</i>

23:35.982 --> 23:35.980
<i> I don't know why I said love--</i>

23:35.982 --> 23:38.983
voice mail: <i> Next message.</i>

23:38.985 --> 23:40.985
Paul: <i> Hey, man, it's Paul.</i>
<i> Uh, got your message.</i>

23:40.987 --> 23:42.887
<i> I'm out of town,</i>
<i> unfortunately,</i>

23:42.889 --> 23:44.555
<i> but let me know next time</i>
<i> you're in L.A.</i>

23:44.557 --> 23:47.992
Voice mail: <i> Next saved message.</i>

23:47.994 --> 23:49.560
Karen: <i> Hey, honey, it's mom.</i>

23:49.562 --> 23:52.463
<i> I love the drawings you sent,</i>

23:52.465 --> 23:54.064
<i> and I know that</i>
<i> it's a lot of work,</i>

23:54.066 --> 23:55.666

23:55.668 --> 23:58.502
<i> Call me if you need</i>
<i> a pep talk, okay?</i>

23:58.504 --> 24:00.738
<i> I miss you. Bye.</i>

24:00.740 --> 24:03.073
Voice mail: <i> Message saved.</i>

25:11.744 --> 25:13.511
Becca: <i> Hey, Dean.</i>

25:13.513 --> 25:15.045
<i> Blast from the past.</i>
<i> It's Becca.</i>

25:15.047 --> 25:15.045
<i> I'm sorry I missed your call.</i>

25:15.047 --> 25:18.782
<i> I just got out of</i>
<i> a pretty intense audition.</i>

25:18.784 --> 25:21.051
<i> Give me a ring.</i>

25:21.053 --> 25:23.220
I'm so sorry to hear about
you and Michelle.

25:23.222 --> 25:25.556
- That sucks.
- Yeah, thanks.

25:25.558 --> 25:28.559
That sucks, but I actually--
i totally relate to that.

25:28.561 --> 25:30.561
I'm actually kind of
going through something

25:30.563 --> 25:32.096
kind of similar.

25:32.098 --> 25:34.765
I'm, like, still in
the middle of it, actually.

25:34.767 --> 25:36.800
But not to name any names,

25:36.802 --> 25:40.104
but give you a hint,
he's starring on a, like,

25:40.106 --> 25:43.107
a ridiculously popular
vampire series.

25:43.109 --> 25:44.608
Well, that narrows it down
quite a bit.

25:44.610 --> 25:47.311
It's, like,
all the rage right now.

25:47.313 --> 25:50.114
Vampires are so in,
and I just don't get it.

25:50.116 --> 25:52.716
It's like, I would pick
mummies if I had my way.

25:52.718 --> 25:55.185
Yeah, he likes to, uh...

25:55.187 --> 25:56.820
He likes
to play with people,

25:56.822 --> 25:59.223
but me, you know, I don't...

25:59.225 --> 26:00.824
I don't play.

26:00.826 --> 26:03.661
Never.
Do you like vampires?

26:03.663 --> 26:06.597
- Uh, no.
- Okay.

26:18.143 --> 26:20.644
Becca: Needless to say, it's
been a whole shitload of drama,

26:20.646 --> 26:22.146
but, you know,
i think I've found something

26:22.148 --> 26:24.748
that is pretty
amazing for me.

26:24.750 --> 26:26.884
- Oh, yeah?
- Improv.

26:28.286 --> 26:30.287
- Comedy.
- Ah.

26:30.289 --> 26:32.323
- Improv comedy. Yeah.
- Right, that kind, yeah.

26:32.325 --> 26:34.792
Improv comedy.

26:34.794 --> 26:36.627
- Dean: Oh, yeah.
- Becca: It's like, um,

26:36.629 --> 26:38.596
where you make stuff
up off the top of your head

26:38.598 --> 26:40.731
and just, like, say shit
for no reason.

26:40.733 --> 26:43.067
- It's amazing.
- Dean: Yeah.

26:43.069 --> 26:45.769
"Yes, and," is, like, the...

26:45.771 --> 26:47.705
The philosophy, you know?

26:47.707 --> 26:49.106
And it's starting to,
like, open me up

26:49.108 --> 26:52.142
in auditions a lot,
and also...

26:52.144 --> 26:54.078
I feel more open,
like, in life.

26:54.080 --> 26:55.879
- Mmm.
- You know?

26:55.881 --> 26:57.681
- I don't know if you can tell
how different I am?
- Oh, yeah.

26:57.683 --> 26:59.383
I was gonna say back there
you're very spontaneous.

26:59.385 --> 27:02.319
Yes. Yes, exactly.

27:02.321 --> 27:04.388
And also my hair.
My hair's also different.

27:04.390 --> 27:06.256
Yes, and lighter.

27:07.926 --> 27:09.360
I just made it darker,
actually.

27:10.295 --> 27:13.797
- There she is.
- Oh, hey, vagsicles.

27:13.799 --> 27:15.332
I am what I eat.

27:15.334 --> 27:18.202
- He said as he quivered.
- Becca: Oh, god.

27:18.204 --> 27:19.837
These guys are in
my improv troupe.

27:19.839 --> 27:21.205
- Noah: Yeah, yeah.
- Guys, this is Dean.

27:21.207 --> 27:22.906
- Hey.
- Dean the Dean

27:22.908 --> 27:24.675
of the university
of first names.

27:24.677 --> 27:26.210
Look at his face.

27:26.212 --> 27:28.112
- Oh...
- You do have, like,

27:28.114 --> 27:30.848
- a funny look, man, like...
- Becca: Funny in, like,
a good way.

27:30.850 --> 27:33.117
- All: Yeah.
- Yeah, it's good.

27:33.119 --> 27:34.785
- It's, like, a hilarious face.
- It is.

27:34.787 --> 27:36.220
- Dean: Thank you.
- Kip: Yeah, it would work good

27:36.222 --> 27:38.288
- on stage, I think.
- Hmm.

27:40.925 --> 27:42.793
Fine.

27:42.795 --> 27:44.795
- Get out of here.
- We reserved this.

27:44.797 --> 27:46.730
- We reserved it for an hour.
- Get out of here.

29:32.871 --> 29:35.506
- Woman: Hey, there.
- Hi.

29:35.508 --> 29:37.441
Hi. Are you okay?

29:37.443 --> 29:39.476
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.
Are you talking about that?

29:39.478 --> 29:41.945
- Uh, yeah.
- No, I just tripped.

29:41.947 --> 29:43.981
- It's no big deal.
- No, don't underplay it.

29:43.983 --> 29:46.450
You really ate it back there.
I saw the whole thing.

29:46.452 --> 29:49.386
Well, thank you. I appreciate
you coming up to let me know.

29:49.388 --> 29:50.921
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you for--

29:50.923 --> 29:53.357
yeah, that was me.

29:53.359 --> 29:55.559
No, I was feeling a little
too comfortable at the party,

29:55.561 --> 29:57.961
and I saw you,
so I figured,

29:57.963 --> 29:59.830
"why don't I eat shit
in the kitchen?"

29:59.832 --> 30:02.966
Oh, good save.
So how do you know Tony?

30:02.968 --> 30:05.803
Uh, Tony?

30:05.805 --> 30:07.271
The owner of the house.

30:07.273 --> 30:09.406
Oh, uh, I saved his life
a while back

30:09.408 --> 30:10.374
and then after that
we just kind of clicked.

30:10.376 --> 30:12.376
Hmm.

30:12.378 --> 30:13.577
- I'm Dean, by the way.
- Hi.

30:13.579 --> 30:18.048
- Hey.
- Uh, Todd's outside,
and he's here with Jeremy.

30:19.317 --> 30:21.385
- I got to go.
Lovely meeting you.
- Oh, yeah, you, too.

30:21.387 --> 30:23.487
Those guys are here,
so you should go.

30:23.489 --> 30:25.389
Yeah.

30:25.391 --> 30:27.057
- Hi.
- I'm poor. You're rich.

30:27.059 --> 30:29.059
Where I'm falling, remember,
i saw your boobs?

30:29.061 --> 30:30.561
We saw y--
we both saw your boobs.

30:30.563 --> 30:32.296
- It was so good.
- I don't like you

30:32.298 --> 30:33.897
saying that when there's other--
they didn't see my...

30:33.899 --> 30:35.499
- Kip: This is a scene.
- Noah: We're doing scenes.

30:35.501 --> 30:38.035
- Becca: We're doing improv.
- Kip: We're doing scenes.

31:04.429 --> 31:06.897
Woman:
Hey, you didn't have to leave.

31:06.899 --> 31:09.633
Just...
Call me later, okay?

31:09.635 --> 31:11.635
Bye.

31:13.137 --> 31:15.873
- Hey.
- Hi.

31:15.875 --> 31:17.007
- Hey.
- Hello.

31:18.142 --> 31:19.943
You never told me
your name.

31:19.945 --> 31:23.347
Oh, well, it starts with an "n,"
and it ends with "icky."

31:23.349 --> 31:25.649
Hmm. You're very cryptic,

31:25.651 --> 31:27.551
like sudoku.

31:27.553 --> 31:29.586
Yeah, I like to
cultivate an air of
mystery around myself.

31:30.955 --> 31:33.457
I do something
very similar with deodorant.

31:33.459 --> 31:35.459
- Hmm.
- Not in a gross way.

31:35.461 --> 31:37.594
I, you know, I don't need
to wear a lot of deodorant.

31:37.596 --> 31:39.563
I don't, you know,
smell that bad or anything.

31:40.565 --> 31:43.166
- Mmm.
- Good, nice, huh?

31:43.168 --> 31:44.201
Which part of Brooklyn
are you from?

31:44.203 --> 31:46.470
It's that obvious?

31:46.472 --> 31:49.172
Yeah, you have a certain just-
off-the-subway quality to you.

31:49.174 --> 31:51.174
Thank you.

31:51.176 --> 31:52.943
You could just say immigrant.
It's cool.

31:52.945 --> 31:54.945
That's not what I meant.

31:54.947 --> 31:57.080
You don't look lobotomized
like the rest of the guys
at this party.

31:57.082 --> 32:00.417
Yeah, I saw a couple
walking head shots downstairs.

32:00.419 --> 32:03.387
Um, so where'd you grow up?

32:03.389 --> 32:05.188
- Nicky, we got to go.
- Oh, okay.

32:05.190 --> 32:07.691
Uh, Dean, this is Jill.
Jill, Dean.

32:07.693 --> 32:10.093
Jill, hey, my best friend
in high school was--

32:10.095 --> 32:12.162
I'm sure it's a great story, but
we're late for a surprise party,

32:12.164 --> 32:13.664
- so I'll just
see you in the car?
- Nicky: Okay.

32:13.666 --> 32:16.166
- Nicky: Okay.
- Well, you just told me, so...

32:17.001 --> 32:18.568
Well, good luck
in L.A., Dean,

32:18.570 --> 32:20.504
and watch out
for kitchen floors.

32:20.506 --> 32:22.139
I will.

32:23.508 --> 32:27.978
Hey, um, you want to, like,
trade emails or something?

32:27.980 --> 32:27.978
I'm gonna be in town,
i don't know, just for
a couple days, but...

32:27.980 --> 32:31.682
- Why don't you just
give me your number?
- Okay.

32:34.686 --> 32:37.220
No, it's cool,
i got a pen and paper.

32:37.222 --> 32:39.556
I'll just write it out,

32:39.558 --> 32:40.724
20th century style.

32:41.659 --> 32:43.093
Tiny, little pad.

32:43.095 --> 32:45.262
Yeah, for just little drawings
or phone numbers.

32:45.264 --> 32:47.731
It's, like, a mini pad...

32:47.733 --> 32:50.534
- As opposed to a maxi pad.

32:50.536 --> 32:52.502
- That was good, right?
- That was good.

32:55.106 --> 32:57.441
Dean: Is this the way
back to my hotel?

32:57.443 --> 33:00.243
Becca:
I don't know. Is it?

33:07.151 --> 33:09.252
So where are we?

33:09.254 --> 33:11.555
This is my place.

33:11.557 --> 33:13.023
- Oh.
- Look, I know you want to

33:13.025 --> 33:15.058
come up and everything,
but you can't.

33:15.060 --> 33:16.560
I'm sorry.

33:16.562 --> 33:17.661
Oh, okay.

33:17.663 --> 33:18.729
I'm sorry if I gave you
that impression.

33:18.731 --> 33:21.164
Yeah,
i have a boyfriend, so...

33:21.166 --> 33:25.235
- Yeah, I know, the vampire.
- Shh.

33:26.771 --> 33:30.173
Look, what you think
is gonna happen right now

33:30.175 --> 33:32.709
is not gonna happen
right now unless...

33:34.312 --> 33:36.246
You can keep a secret.

33:37.115 --> 33:39.049
I'm not good
at keeping secrets.

33:39.051 --> 33:42.552
Ow.
That really hurt.

33:42.554 --> 33:44.554
Don't pretend you didn't
fucking love that.

33:44.556 --> 33:46.056
I'm not pretending.

33:46.058 --> 33:48.158
Come here.
Look at me.

33:49.327 --> 33:51.728
Oh, my god, not like that.
Don't look at me like that.

33:51.730 --> 33:54.031
Okay, hey, Becca,
you're scaring me.

33:54.033 --> 33:56.600
I know.
I'm scaring myself.

33:56.602 --> 33:59.069
But you can't look at me
like that, okay?

33:59.071 --> 34:01.071
You don't get to
look at me like that.

34:01.073 --> 34:03.240
Okay, but you're
hurting my neck.

34:03.242 --> 34:06.309
Oh, my god, it's part of it.

34:07.311 --> 34:09.545
- Ow.
- You got to go, okay?

34:09.547 --> 34:11.214
You just got to go.

34:11.216 --> 34:12.748
Yeah, I should get back.

34:12.751 --> 34:14.650
Yeah.
You need to leave.

34:16.587 --> 34:18.621
- Oh. Can I get a ride?
- Get out of my car.

34:18.623 --> 34:21.224
- No, you can't get a ride.
- Okay.

34:21.226 --> 34:24.293
- Okay.
- After that you want a ride?

34:24.295 --> 34:25.661
Okay, good seeing you.

34:25.664 --> 34:27.264
- Good night.

34:49.853 --> 34:53.255
- Carol?
- Hey.

34:53.257 --> 34:54.757
Oh, hi.

34:56.793 --> 34:58.728
I thought I was
in the wrong house.

35:00.665 --> 35:02.399
Is it okay?
Has everyone left?

35:02.401 --> 35:05.669
Carol: Uh, yeah, yeah, all gone.
Coast is clear.

35:05.671 --> 35:08.138
How did we do?
Did any-- we did okay?

35:08.140 --> 35:11.708
Yeah, we do have
two very serious

35:11.710 --> 35:13.877
- potential buyers.
- Wow.

35:13.879 --> 35:16.713
Yeah, I think your home
is gonna sell a lot faster
than I thought.

35:18.182 --> 35:20.283
- Wow. Great.
- Yeah.

35:20.285 --> 35:22.419
Well,
it'll be thanks to you.

35:22.421 --> 35:24.254
Where do you find
all this stuff?

35:24.256 --> 35:26.790
It's, like, do you--
do you and Patrick travel a lot?

35:27.692 --> 35:30.827
- Patrick?
- Your husband.

35:30.829 --> 35:33.230
No, um, he is not my husband.

35:33.232 --> 35:36.199
- He's my colleague.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

35:36.201 --> 35:39.136
- You thought, uh...
- I assume everyone's married.

35:39.138 --> 35:40.837
- No. No, no, no, no, no.
- If they're together...

35:40.839 --> 35:42.706
- Stupid. Sorry.
- Um, no.

35:42.708 --> 35:43.874
No, it's...
No, it's fine.

35:43.876 --> 35:47.310
Um, well, let's see
if we got any more,

35:47.312 --> 35:48.612
uh, potential bidders.

35:48.614 --> 35:51.148
Wait, wait, wait,
what was that?

35:51.150 --> 35:52.449
- That looked like you.
- Uh, you don't want to--

35:52.451 --> 35:54.751
that's embarrassing.

35:54.753 --> 35:57.888
- What is that?
- My charming sister

35:57.890 --> 36:01.391
decided to create an online
dating profile for me,

36:01.393 --> 36:04.361
and I spent, um,
much of yesterday

36:04.363 --> 36:06.463
trying to take
a usable photo

36:06.465 --> 36:08.899
to throw myself
at strangers online.

36:08.901 --> 36:11.301
I'm just curious.
"I like listening to jazz--"

36:11.303 --> 36:14.671
oh, sophisticated.
"Taking long walks..."

36:14.673 --> 36:18.441
Forests, one of
your interests is "forests"?

36:18.443 --> 36:20.343
- I've-- well, I like--
- you're interested in forests?

36:20.345 --> 36:22.746
Well, I like nature and trees
and, like, being out in nature.

36:22.748 --> 36:24.281
Oh, I see. Yeah, of course.
Well, sure.

36:24.283 --> 36:26.750
- Does that sound weird?
- No, i-i just don't--

36:26.752 --> 36:30.287
- should I just have said trees?
- No, no, forests-- I see.

36:30.289 --> 36:31.955
I just did-- you--
the wording.

36:31.957 --> 36:35.225
You don't want to attract, like,
a lumberjack or a hermit or a...

36:35.227 --> 36:36.860
A lumberjack
who's online dating?

36:36.862 --> 36:38.728
I don't think I have
to worry about that.

36:38.730 --> 36:42.232
If you said, "i like
taking long, shady walks,"

36:42.234 --> 36:44.267
- that implies forests.
- That sounds threatening,

36:44.269 --> 36:47.237
like I'm a mugger
or something.

36:47.239 --> 36:48.471
I think I'm gonna
sell your house

36:48.473 --> 36:51.241
and leave the online dating
to someone else.

36:51.243 --> 36:52.742
I'm sorry.

36:52.744 --> 36:54.444
Let me see if we got you
any more offers or...

36:54.446 --> 36:56.780
- Okay.
- ...Interests or calls.

36:58.449 --> 37:00.784
Dean: Look, it was a free trip,
so I sat through one meeting.

37:00.786 --> 37:02.485
Eric:
Exactly, free day in L.A.

37:02.487 --> 37:04.521
You've got me as your guide.

37:04.523 --> 37:06.489
We're gonna do some cool shit.
I got some plans.

37:06.491 --> 37:07.490
Cool.

37:07.492 --> 37:09.726
Have you had smoothie king?

37:10.895 --> 37:13.296
Huh?

37:13.298 --> 37:15.699
- It's funny.
It's always a king.
- What?

37:15.701 --> 37:18.335
You know, smoothie king,
burger king, mattress king.

37:18.337 --> 37:20.537
If you're selling something,
it has to be a king.

37:20.539 --> 37:22.806
Smoothie Duke?
Nope.

37:22.808 --> 37:24.841
Burger prime minister?
You can't do it.

37:25.876 --> 37:28.278
What about dairy queen?
That works.

37:28.280 --> 37:30.814
Yeah, okay, that's one.

37:30.816 --> 37:33.316
Hold up.
I left my phone in the car.

37:33.318 --> 37:36.253
- So?
- I want to get my phone.

37:36.255 --> 37:38.822
Yeah, we're going in here for,
like, ten minutes.

37:38.824 --> 37:39.923
Yeah,
i want to get my phone.

37:39.925 --> 37:41.758
I need it.

37:42.827 --> 37:46.763
- Great, great, let's do that.
- Thank you.

37:49.400 --> 37:50.900
Heads up.

37:52.370 --> 37:53.503
Thanks, asshole.

37:53.505 --> 37:57.407
Would it kill you to be present
for, like, 30 seconds?

37:57.409 --> 37:58.908
Uh-huh.

38:02.847 --> 38:05.482
Oh, there she is,
coming back.

38:09.487 --> 38:10.954
Oh, fuck.

38:10.956 --> 38:12.322
Waiting for party girl
to call?

38:12.324 --> 38:12.322
No.

38:12.324 --> 38:15.325
It's not gonna happen, man.
You screwed up.

38:15.327 --> 38:17.294
- She'll call me.
- No, she won't.

38:17.296 --> 38:19.462
Shithead.

38:19.464 --> 38:21.965
You gave her your number
instead of getting her number,

38:21.967 --> 38:24.034
so now she has all the power,
she gets to mess with your head

38:24.036 --> 38:25.035
- instead of you
messing with her.
- Yeah, right.

38:25.037 --> 38:26.603
- Uh-huh.
- Right?

38:26.605 --> 38:28.438
You're leaving tomorrow anyway,
so who gives a shit?

38:28.440 --> 38:31.608
You leave tomorrow anyways,
so let's just put her aside.

38:31.610 --> 38:33.076
You and me,
tonight, we go out,

38:33.078 --> 38:35.345
and I show you what
you've missed in Brooklyn.

38:35.347 --> 38:37.347
What's that, bar, club?

38:37.349 --> 38:38.882
- A club, yes.

38:38.884 --> 38:40.517
I can't, man.
I got plans.

38:41.886 --> 38:43.086
- Doing what?
- I'm supposed to be--

39:24.628 --> 39:26.863
Dean: Hi.

39:28.999 --> 39:30.367
Bye.

39:30.369 --> 39:33.403
I like that shirt.
It's really brave.

39:33.405 --> 39:35.638
Brave?
What does that mean?

39:35.640 --> 39:38.074
Well, I mean, it's just not the
most flattering shirt on you,

39:38.076 --> 39:39.943
but I think it's really cool

39:39.945 --> 39:40.643
that you don't care
about that kind of thing.

39:40.645 --> 39:42.412
It's awesome.

39:42.414 --> 39:44.013
Yeah, it gives you
bigger hips, a little bit.

39:44.015 --> 39:46.549
He's kidding. He's joking.

39:47.651 --> 39:49.419
A joke.

39:49.421 --> 39:50.653
- Shut up.

39:50.655 --> 39:53.857
Both: Wow.

39:53.859 --> 39:56.626
Yeah. Okay.

39:56.628 --> 39:58.094
- Hey.
- Hi.

39:58.096 --> 40:00.029
- How are you?
- Really good.

40:00.031 --> 40:01.097
- Cool.
- Yeah.

40:01.099 --> 40:03.099
Your hair looks
a little weird.

40:03.101 --> 40:04.667
Excuse me?

40:04.669 --> 40:06.636
- Excuse me?
- My--

40:06.638 --> 40:10.673
has anybody ever told you that
you look very attracted to me?

40:10.675 --> 40:14.110
No, not yet.

40:14.112 --> 40:16.579
Well, they have now.
Just did.

40:16.581 --> 40:18.982
- Yeah, you did.
- Cheers.

40:18.984 --> 40:20.650
- Oh, cheers, yeah.
- Cheers.

40:20.652 --> 40:22.018
What are you guys
doing after this?

40:22.020 --> 40:25.488
Um, I don't think--
i don't know.

40:25.490 --> 40:28.525
- After party at our place?
- Who are you doing after this?

40:28.527 --> 40:31.094
- Who are you doing after this?
- What?

40:32.696 --> 40:34.030
Nothing.

40:40.905 --> 40:42.705
Listen, I just want
to apologize again for...

40:42.707 --> 40:45.008
What?

40:45.010 --> 40:47.477
- You know, the ladies.
- Oh, shut up. You're fine.

40:49.013 --> 40:51.014
You're in a funk right now.
I get it, you know?

40:51.016 --> 40:54.184
- I've been there.
I can spot it.
- Yeah.

40:54.186 --> 40:56.186
And, honestly, I think
you're over-thinking it.

40:56.188 --> 40:58.021
You just got to do
something spontaneous.

40:58.023 --> 40:59.722
Be a spontaneous person.
Get out of it.

40:59.724 --> 41:01.224
Okay, you know what?

41:02.626 --> 41:04.594
Let me make it up to you.

41:04.596 --> 41:06.663
Why don't I take you out?

41:06.665 --> 41:08.465
- Okay?
- Okay.

41:08.467 --> 41:09.566
Where do you want to go?

41:10.734 --> 41:13.036
You know what we could do?

41:13.038 --> 41:15.071
We could drive
to Vegas right now.

41:15.073 --> 41:16.506
Okay.

41:16.508 --> 41:17.774
- Yeah? You want to do this?
- Yeah. Yeah.

41:17.776 --> 41:20.009
- You're into going to Vegas?
- Totally.

41:20.011 --> 41:20.009
'Cause I'm down.

41:20.011 --> 41:23.213
I'm not saying it like,
"hey, let's just talk about it."

41:23.215 --> 41:24.948
I'm saying let's go and do it.

41:24.950 --> 41:26.249
- We're going to Vegas.
- We're going to Vegas.

41:26.251 --> 41:27.617
- We'll get there.
- Okay.

41:27.619 --> 41:29.652
- I'll show you the ropes.
- All right.

41:29.654 --> 41:31.254
- I'm gonna lay it out there.
You'll see what's going on.
- All right.

41:31.256 --> 41:33.056
- You know Vegas?
- Of course I know Vegas.

41:33.058 --> 41:34.524
It's the best.
I love it.

41:36.660 --> 41:38.127
It's just such a hassle.

41:38.129 --> 41:40.630
I mean, it's
four-and-a-half hours away.

41:40.632 --> 41:42.599
Yeah. Want to
get some sleep?

41:44.768 --> 41:46.970
Yeah.

41:46.972 --> 41:49.506
Hey, man, it was
great seeing you.

41:49.508 --> 41:51.808
- Cheers, buddy.
- Cheers.

42:08.093 --> 42:10.693
You going home or on a trip?

42:10.695 --> 42:13.029
- I'm going home.
- Oh, me too, thank god.

42:13.031 --> 42:14.264
- You live in the city?
- Brooklyn.

42:14.266 --> 42:16.766
Oh, good.

42:16.768 --> 42:20.103
I'm on dekalb and Washington.
I love it.

42:20.105 --> 42:23.306
- Yeah, I'm ready to get back.
- I really love it, though.

42:23.308 --> 42:26.809
New York's the best, period.
No contest.

42:26.811 --> 42:28.711
Even queens.

42:28.713 --> 42:30.647
Yeah, I think I've seen enough
of L.A. to last me for--

42:30.649 --> 42:33.116
oh...

42:33.118 --> 42:35.051
I'm never going back
to L.A. again.

42:35.053 --> 42:36.619
No, no, no, I can't.
For my health, I can't.

42:37.755 --> 42:40.123
Okay. I'm gonna try
to take a nap.

42:40.125 --> 42:42.158
- I'm pretty tired.
- Oh, yeah.

42:42.160 --> 42:44.327
Naomi.
I'm Naomi, by the way.

42:44.329 --> 42:47.130
Before you, you know.

42:47.132 --> 42:49.832
Good to meet you, Naomi.
Take a nap.

42:49.834 --> 42:52.802
- Your name would be?
- I'm Dean.

42:52.804 --> 42:54.837
Dean.

42:54.839 --> 42:57.774
Put her there.
Yeah.

42:57.776 --> 43:00.143
- Sleep tight.
- Thanks.

43:00.145 --> 43:02.278
I should be sleeping.

43:02.280 --> 43:03.279
I'm exhausted.

43:03.281 --> 43:05.748
I'm so wired
from the anxiety,

43:05.750 --> 43:08.851
from the trauma of Los Angeles
that I can't sleep.

43:08.853 --> 43:11.220
I'm not myself.

43:12.723 --> 43:15.291
So what do you do...

43:15.293 --> 43:16.225
For work?

43:17.661 --> 43:19.195
I'm a...

43:21.065 --> 43:23.132
- Speech therapist.
- Oh.

43:23.134 --> 43:24.867
Yeah.
I work with animals.

43:24.869 --> 43:27.303
Mmm. Communication.

43:27.305 --> 43:29.772
How to listen,
how to communicate,

43:29.774 --> 43:32.108
- reading signals.
- Yeah.

43:32.110 --> 43:33.710
- 'Cause they can speak.
- They can communicate.

43:33.712 --> 43:35.178
It's been proven
time and time again.

43:35.180 --> 43:37.780
They are communicating,
but we're so blocked.

43:37.782 --> 43:39.716
Animals, no subtlety.

43:41.353 --> 43:43.653
- It's crass.

43:46.323 --> 43:47.924
- You texting?
- I am.

43:47.926 --> 43:49.325
- Excuse me, excuse me.
- Yeah.

43:49.327 --> 43:51.127
Get in these last moments
while you can

43:51.129 --> 43:52.328
- before she comes around...

43:52.330 --> 43:54.263
...and gets ya.

43:57.235 --> 43:59.335
- Sir?
- Yeah.

43:59.337 --> 44:00.737
You have to turn that off.

44:02.906 --> 44:05.141
- Sir?
- Um...

44:54.325 --> 44:56.259
I'm a scientist.

45:38.001 --> 45:40.436
- Hi.
- Hey.

45:40.438 --> 45:42.505
You are a little late,
mister.

45:42.507 --> 45:45.308
- Yeah.
- And you brought a suitcase.

45:45.310 --> 45:48.211
Yeah, actually, I was on
my plane and I got your text.

45:48.213 --> 45:50.279
You just, you know,
hopped off the plane

45:50.281 --> 45:51.380
and ran straight over here?

45:51.382 --> 45:52.915
I usually have
that effect on people.

45:52.917 --> 45:54.450
Yeah, yeah.
No, I'm kidding.

45:54.452 --> 45:56.853
Really,
what's with the suitcase?

45:56.855 --> 45:59.322
No, I was staying with
my friend Eric, and--

45:59.324 --> 45:59.322
I'm gonna stay with Eric.

45:59.324 --> 46:02.925
I was staying at a hotel
and going from my hotel

46:02.927 --> 46:04.794
to my friend Eric's place,
and he's still at work,

46:04.796 --> 46:05.995
so I ended up
with all my stuff.

46:05.997 --> 46:07.396
- I'm kind of stranded.
- Oh.

46:07.398 --> 46:09.265
Uh, volleyball gear,
you know.

46:09.267 --> 46:11.801
So, uh, is this yours?

46:11.803 --> 46:14.337
- Yeah.
- Cool.

46:14.339 --> 46:17.340
Are you fishing
for a ride right now?

46:17.342 --> 46:19.342
Oh, I'm not fishing,
but now that you mention it,

46:19.344 --> 46:20.409
- that would work for me.
- Okay.

46:20.411 --> 46:21.811
- Cool. Great.
- Okay.

46:21.813 --> 46:23.279
- Sure.
- Awesome.

46:23.281 --> 46:25.348
- Um, you gonna drive?
- No, I'm not gonna drive.

46:25.350 --> 46:26.883
- Okay.
- I was just, you know,
being polite.

46:26.885 --> 46:28.317
Thanks.

46:49.573 --> 46:50.973
Nicky: You want the story
for real?

46:50.975 --> 46:52.008
Dean: Yeah, I'm curious.

46:52.010 --> 46:53.810
All right, I was in college.

46:53.812 --> 46:56.846
I came up with
this natural beauty product,

46:56.848 --> 46:59.115
and I ended up
dropping out

46:59.117 --> 47:01.017
'cause I was
tinkering with it.

47:01.019 --> 47:02.852
First, I started
giving it to my friends.

47:02.854 --> 47:04.821
Then I started selling it,
and then this

47:04.823 --> 47:06.989
big cosmetics brand
actually bought it,

47:06.991 --> 47:09.392
um, but that was
a couple of years ago,

47:09.394 --> 47:11.961
- so nothing really since.
- Wow.

47:11.963 --> 47:13.095
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

47:13.097 --> 47:14.897
Wow.

47:14.899 --> 47:16.999
- So you have, like,
a patent and everything?
- Yeah.

47:17.001 --> 47:18.434
So you're an inventor?

47:18.436 --> 47:20.403
I think of myself more of,
like, a chef

47:20.405 --> 47:21.571
'cause I came up with,
you know,

47:21.573 --> 47:23.005
a few recipes
that actually worked.

47:23.007 --> 47:25.341
- That's amazing.

47:25.343 --> 47:27.109
Seriously. You know,
when I'm drawing,

47:27.111 --> 47:28.911
sometimes I'll come up with,
like, an invention or something

47:28.913 --> 47:30.413
and I'll just do a sketch.

47:30.415 --> 47:32.048
- Really? Like what?
- But nothing like that.

47:32.050 --> 47:33.482
Um, let's see.

47:34.384 --> 47:36.419
- So you're on a plane, right?
- Mm-hmm.

47:36.421 --> 47:38.421
This happens a lot.
Plane's packed.

47:38.423 --> 47:40.356
There's a baby that's
crying super loud.

47:40.358 --> 47:42.391
It's bothering everybody.
How do you get that baby quiet?

47:43.126 --> 47:44.994
Baby silencer.

47:44.996 --> 47:46.562
All right, it's a funnel.

47:46.564 --> 47:48.431
You put it over the baby's
nose and mouth

47:48.433 --> 47:51.067
with a tube, like,
a little kind of tube,

47:51.069 --> 47:53.436
and it goes to headphones
that go to the baby's own ears,

47:53.438 --> 47:55.438
so when the baby's crying
just like,

47:55.440 --> 47:58.441
"wah, wah!" Really loud,
it's contained into the tubes,

47:58.443 --> 48:00.343
and then just like,
"ow, ow, that hurts.

48:00.345 --> 48:01.944
Hello? Wah.
Uh, who is that?

48:01.946 --> 48:03.379
That's me.
I should stop."

48:03.381 --> 48:03.379
Baby silenced.

48:03.381 --> 48:08.384
So what you have is something
that will silence the baby

48:08.386 --> 48:10.987
and also teach the baby
about self-awareness

48:10.989 --> 48:12.588
and cause and effect, so...

48:12.590 --> 48:14.657
You know,
i would make sure

48:14.659 --> 48:16.592
that there's adequate
breathing apparatus

48:16.594 --> 48:16.592
and, you know,
holes in it and stuff,

48:16.594 --> 48:19.929
so I'm not gonna do
anything crazy to the baby.

48:19.931 --> 48:22.064
Do you think that that would
actually work for adults

48:22.066 --> 48:24.367
with helping them
develop self-awareness?

48:24.369 --> 48:26.469
Perhaps you could
send the sound of them

48:26.471 --> 48:28.938
pitching an invention
straight into their own ears?

48:28.940 --> 48:30.206
Like in a restaurant
or something?

48:30.208 --> 48:32.408
- Yeah.

48:57.935 --> 48:59.602
- Thank you for dinner.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

48:59.604 --> 49:00.970
No, it was my pleasure.

49:00.972 --> 49:02.238
- That was fun.
- Yeah.

49:02.240 --> 49:04.240
- I had a good time.
- Me, too.

49:04.242 --> 49:05.975
- And thanks for the ride.
- You're welcome.

49:06.677 --> 49:09.612
Um, okay,
so just to be clear.

49:09.614 --> 49:10.713
Mm-hmm?

49:19.990 --> 49:21.157
- Okay.
- Okay.

49:21.658 --> 49:24.961
- I'll get my stuff. All right.
- Okay.

49:24.963 --> 49:26.529
Whoa, okay.

49:30.968 --> 49:32.635
- Dean: Hello.
- All right.

49:32.637 --> 49:35.237
There he is.

49:35.239 --> 49:37.106
So this is it.

49:37.108 --> 49:39.108
Um, that's the couch.
That's gonna be, uh...

49:39.110 --> 49:40.543
- All yours.
- Wow.

49:40.545 --> 49:43.145
Assuming that's okay
with tobes.

49:43.147 --> 49:45.548
Totally, no problem.

49:45.550 --> 49:47.683
- Heard you're here
stalking some girl.
- What?

49:47.685 --> 49:49.752
Yeah, my friend
stalked a girl once.

49:49.754 --> 49:51.253
She lived in China,

49:51.255 --> 49:53.456
so I'm not sure if it
counted as stalking per se

49:53.458 --> 49:56.158
'cause he was
in San Diego.

49:56.160 --> 49:57.693
I contended that
it was more like

49:57.695 --> 50:00.196
keeping tabs on her
from that distance.

50:00.198 --> 50:02.498
- Yeah,
I'm not stalking anybody.
- That's exactly what he said.

50:02.500 --> 50:05.735
- Yeah, but I'm not.
- Agree to disagree.

50:11.708 --> 50:15.111
Damn it.

50:15.113 --> 50:17.580
- What did you tell him?
- What? Don't worry about Toby.

50:17.582 --> 50:20.149
He's his own thing, man.
So tell me about this girl.

50:20.151 --> 50:23.119
Oh, well, she drove me back
from the-- whoa!

50:23.121 --> 50:25.187
- What the hell is this?
- What?

50:26.591 --> 50:28.491
I have a cat.
You know that.

50:28.493 --> 50:31.127
No, I did not know that.
I do now, though.

50:31.129 --> 50:32.628
And I'll never forget it.

50:32.630 --> 50:34.296
Yeah, I share my room
with Nicholas.

50:34.298 --> 50:37.233
- He loves this shit.

50:38.035 --> 50:39.502
Anyways, the girl,
what's going on?

50:39.504 --> 50:41.203
Uh, yeah, so we, uh--

50:41.205 --> 50:43.172
I'm sorry, i--

50:45.042 --> 50:47.076
- when did you get into cats?
- All right, come on, enough.

50:47.078 --> 50:48.310
- All right.
- I have a cat.
Let's move on.

50:48.312 --> 50:50.579
Okay, okay.

50:50.581 --> 50:52.114
Yeah, it went
really well, and, uh,

50:52.116 --> 50:53.249
we're gonna get
together on Tuesday.

50:53.251 --> 50:55.184
- That's great. Day or night?
- Day.

50:55.186 --> 50:57.086
- Day? That's not good.
- Yeah.

50:57.088 --> 50:58.354
- Night. Night.
- What?

50:58.356 --> 50:59.755
You want night time, late.

50:59.757 --> 51:02.091
Her defenses are down.
She's kind of tired.

51:02.093 --> 51:04.293
Okay, I don't want to kill her.
I want to date her.

51:04.295 --> 51:07.630
Date her?
Let's slow down, 1955, okay?

51:07.632 --> 51:09.098
Let's just try
to sleep with her first.

51:09.100 --> 51:11.700
Yeah, I mean, that, too.
That's what I meant.

51:13.770 --> 51:16.372
Here, bud.

51:16.374 --> 51:18.307
- You okay, man?
- Yeah.

51:18.309 --> 51:21.110
- Like, things are okay?
- Yeah, things are great.

51:21.112 --> 51:22.845
Okay.

51:42.133 --> 51:45.134
Do a little bunny hop.
Ahh!

51:49.172 --> 51:51.807
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm good. I'm good.

51:51.809 --> 51:53.676
I'll be honest,
i didn't mean to fall,

51:53.678 --> 51:56.679
but I did mean
to take the risk, okay?

51:56.681 --> 51:59.682
- And that's how you ride.
- You're the man.

52:02.253 --> 52:04.220
- I feel amazing.
- Race?

52:04.222 --> 52:06.355
Yeah, let's go.

53:16.193 --> 53:18.327
- Hey, dad.
- Oh, you're there.

53:18.329 --> 53:20.329
- Are you back?
- Dean: <i> No, I'm still in L.A.</i>

53:20.331 --> 53:23.232
<i>I decided to stay a bit longer.</i>

53:23.234 --> 53:25.768
- What are you doing out there?
- Just working on my tan.

53:25.770 --> 53:27.436
I was gonna maybe get
my chest waxed.

53:27.438 --> 53:29.205
<i> You are?</i>

53:29.207 --> 53:31.307
<i> No, I'm just</i>
<i> catching up with Eric</i>

53:31.309 --> 53:33.342
<i>and just trying to take a little</i>
<i> break, since I'm out here.</i>

53:33.344 --> 53:34.843
A break from what?

53:34.845 --> 53:36.378
Dean: <i> You know,</i>
<i> just everything at home.</i>

53:36.380 --> 53:37.780
<i> Things are kind of heavy.</i>

53:37.782 --> 53:38.914
<i> I just want to get</i>
<i> a little breather.</i>

53:38.916 --> 53:41.250
I see.
No, it's a good idea.

53:41.252 --> 53:43.686
- Why don't you go on to Hawaii?
- Okay, I'm not on vacation.

53:43.688 --> 53:45.221
I'm still working on my book.

53:45.223 --> 53:46.689
You know, I can do that
from here, too.

53:46.691 --> 53:48.791
<i> I need to talk to you</i>
<i> about the house.</i>

53:48.793 --> 53:51.760
Okay, okay, right, yeah.
Let's talk about the house.

53:51.762 --> 53:53.796
We had an open house and--

53:53.798 --> 53:55.397
<i> whoa, wait, wait.</i>
<i>We were gonna make the decision</i>

53:55.399 --> 53:58.334
-<i> about the house together.</i>
- Yeah, we did. I did.

53:58.336 --> 54:00.502
And i--
since you decided to run away.

54:00.504 --> 54:02.338
<i> Okay, I didn't run away.</i>

54:02.340 --> 54:03.973
<i> I came out to meet</i>
<i> those ad people.</i>

54:03.975 --> 54:06.742
Can we just not do anything
with the house until I get back?

54:06.744 --> 54:08.477
<i> Okay?</i>

54:08.479 --> 54:10.346
Okay.

54:11.348 --> 54:12.948
Carol: Well, you know,
you had a really good realtor.

54:12.950 --> 54:16.919
- Yes, well done.
- To full asking price.

54:16.921 --> 54:19.955
Oh, full asking price,
yes.

54:19.957 --> 54:22.424
Now how do I break
the news to my son?

54:22.426 --> 54:24.360
Mmm.

54:25.295 --> 54:28.364
Well, we could ask for some
extra time before closing.

54:28.366 --> 54:30.432
People are understanding
about that.

54:30.434 --> 54:34.403
He's just been at loose ends,
kind of, you know,

54:34.405 --> 54:36.538
missing in action
for a while.

54:36.540 --> 54:38.507
Now he's in L.A.

54:38.509 --> 54:39.975
I don't know
what he's doing.

54:39.977 --> 54:41.777
I keep thinking he's gonna
come home with a mohawk

54:41.779 --> 54:44.546
and face piercings.

54:44.548 --> 54:46.849
People still get mohawks?

54:46.851 --> 54:49.485
Oh, if Dean thought it would
help him not get a job,

54:49.487 --> 54:51.420
he'd get two mohawks.

54:51.422 --> 54:53.856
How do you--

54:53.858 --> 54:56.058
how do you get two mohawks?
I--

54:56.060 --> 54:57.860
you put two mohawks
together, and you...

54:57.862 --> 55:00.429
I don't know.

55:00.431 --> 55:03.866
It'd be sort of an "x,"
look like a heliport.

55:03.868 --> 55:06.902
Maybe he's just trying
to figure himself out.

55:06.904 --> 55:09.371
Yeah, he's been
trying for a while.

55:09.373 --> 55:11.874
I'm sorry, I shouldn't
be talking about this.

55:11.876 --> 55:13.876
- I don't want
to cross any lines.
- Don't be silly.

55:13.878 --> 55:16.412
You've already
crossed those lines,

55:16.414 --> 55:18.914
and that's okay.

55:20.350 --> 55:21.850
Okay.

55:22.986 --> 55:26.889
Mmm, why don't I look
for some listings,

55:26.891 --> 55:30.526
and we'll maybe look at
some places later this week?

55:30.528 --> 55:32.594
- All right, sounds good.
- Yeah?

55:32.596 --> 55:34.530
- It's a date.

55:37.067 --> 55:38.801
- Hi.
- Dean: Hey.

55:38.803 --> 55:40.903
- Hi.
- How are you?

55:40.905 --> 55:40.903
- It's good to see you. Hey.
- Hi, you, too.

55:40.905 --> 55:44.606
Um, you remember my friend Jill
from the party the other night?

55:44.608 --> 55:45.941
- Yeah, hey, Jill.
- Jill: Hey.

55:45.943 --> 55:48.010
Hey. Okay.

55:48.012 --> 55:50.045
- She wanted to see
the show too, so...
- Cool.

55:50.047 --> 55:51.947
- So...
- You were wearing
that same outfit

55:51.949 --> 55:54.116
- the last time I saw you.
- Yes, I was.

55:54.118 --> 55:56.385
Thank you for pointing
that out, I appreciate that.

55:56.387 --> 55:58.020
We need to find a restroom,
like, right now.

55:58.022 --> 56:00.422
Oh, yeah, uh,
number one only.

56:12.535 --> 56:14.536
- Hey.
- Hi.

56:14.538 --> 56:17.139
- So I'm gonna go.
- Okay, bye.

56:17.141 --> 56:18.674
- Yeah, I got to go.
- Really?

56:18.676 --> 56:20.142
That's the game
you're gonna play?

56:20.144 --> 56:23.445
- Oh, I'm not playing a game.
- Oh, aren't you?

56:23.447 --> 56:25.547
- I can stay for a few.
- Thanks.

56:25.549 --> 56:28.550
- So, okay, the artist--
- Jill: Nicky, come look
at this.

56:28.552 --> 56:30.619
- Oh, okay.
- Jill: Yeah.

56:52.642 --> 56:55.444
Oh, yeah, hey, uh--
just a sec.

56:55.446 --> 56:57.413
Yeah, I can be there in,
like, ten minutes.

56:57.415 --> 56:58.680
Yeah, totally.

57:02.585 --> 57:05.687
Weird reception out here.
Yeah, in your face so hard.

57:05.689 --> 57:07.423
I was just doing a bit.

57:07.425 --> 57:09.024
Are you gonna stay,
or are you gonna go?

57:09.026 --> 57:11.126
Um, I'll stay.

57:11.128 --> 57:14.029
- Phew, what a relief.
- Yeah.

57:14.031 --> 57:17.533
Uh, so Jill's, like,
your best friend?

57:17.535 --> 57:19.635
- Is that the deal?
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

57:19.637 --> 57:20.702
And you guys just
do everything together?

57:20.704 --> 57:22.471
A lot of stuff.

57:22.473 --> 57:24.139
You show up everywhere with her?
That's normal?

57:24.141 --> 57:26.041
Do you have a best friend?

57:26.043 --> 57:28.610
Um, kind of.
Former, I'd say.

57:28.612 --> 57:31.013
- He ditched you?
- He got married.

57:31.015 --> 57:33.549
But... we weren't romantic.
It's not like that.

57:33.551 --> 57:35.017
- No, I get it.
- Yeah.

57:35.019 --> 57:36.718
But you're a little sad
about it.

57:36.720 --> 57:39.621
- Mmm, no, I think I'm--
- Jill: Nicky...

57:39.623 --> 57:42.157
Look at this one.

57:42.159 --> 57:45.027
Isn't his work powerful?

57:45.029 --> 57:46.562
I want to put it
above my bed.

57:46.564 --> 57:48.096
Becca: Dean?

57:48.731 --> 57:49.998
Dean: Hey.

57:51.734 --> 57:54.503
Jill: Is that that guy
from that vampire show?

57:54.505 --> 57:56.738
- Man: That's Dean, huh?
- Yeah.

57:56.740 --> 57:59.241
- Dean: Hey, Becca.
- Hi.

58:01.011 --> 58:02.644
I thought you went
back to New York.

58:02.646 --> 58:05.614
I extended my trip
a little bit.

58:05.616 --> 58:07.649
- Why don't you just
get back to New York now?
- Yeah.

58:07.651 --> 58:09.585
- I'm pretty sure she doesn't
want to see you ever again.
- I don't.

58:10.687 --> 58:13.222
Just so you know...

58:13.224 --> 58:16.058
- We're done.
- Done.

58:16.060 --> 58:16.058
- Me and you?
- Becca: Mm-hmm.

58:16.060 --> 58:19.561
- Okay, yeah, I'm pretty
sure we never started.
- Oh, my god.

58:19.563 --> 58:22.064
All right, well, let's make
things real simple here, okay?

58:22.066 --> 58:23.699
Why don't you just end
whatever you had going on

58:23.701 --> 58:26.268
and just agree to
never talk to her again?

58:28.171 --> 58:31.540
- Okay.
- Don't say another word
to her

58:31.542 --> 58:33.542
starting now.

58:33.544 --> 58:36.144
- Okay.
- Ah! Not one more word.

58:39.215 --> 58:40.782
- He got it.
- I'm sorry.

58:40.784 --> 58:42.985
What was that?

58:42.987 --> 58:45.053
- I just heard something.
- Let's go.

58:45.055 --> 58:45.053
- Nicky: Okay, okay, okay.
- You want it on the other side
of the face?

58:45.055 --> 58:45.053
- Becca: Oh, my god.
- You're in an art gallery
right now.

58:45.055 --> 58:45.053
- No, come on, you--
- I think he's really sorry

58:45.055 --> 58:50.192
and he's not gonna say
another word.

58:50.194 --> 58:52.561
- Hey, look at me. Come here.
- What?

58:52.563 --> 58:54.096
- I'm sorry. I'm good, yeah?
- Look at me.

58:54.098 --> 58:57.232
Oh, my god,
I'm-- oh, yeah, yeah.

58:57.234 --> 58:59.701
- Yeah.
- Becca: Uh-huh.

59:05.642 --> 59:07.843
- Are you okay?
- I am, thank you.

59:07.845 --> 59:09.545
Thanks.
I appreciate that.

59:09.547 --> 59:11.780
That fake vampire, he's just
lucky I didn't lose my shit.

59:11.782 --> 59:14.182
- Oh.
- Could kill a man, you know?

59:14.184 --> 59:16.084
I took kendo
in high school, so...

59:18.121 --> 59:20.222
Is that--
does that require sticks?

59:21.190 --> 59:22.224
Not the way I do it.

59:24.661 --> 59:26.128
By the way, Becca--

59:26.130 --> 59:28.263
I mean...
There's nothing there.

59:28.265 --> 59:30.232
- I don't know what she's--
- oh, you don't have to explain
anything to me.

59:30.234 --> 59:31.733
- I--
- no, I know, I know.

59:31.735 --> 59:34.069
I know, I just-- I figured
I'd just let you know.

59:34.071 --> 59:35.737
You know,
it's not like we're...

59:35.739 --> 59:37.573
- Yeah, I mean, we're just--
- yeah, we're hanging out.

59:37.575 --> 59:39.141
- It's fine, yeah.
- I mean, you're visiting.

59:39.143 --> 59:41.176
- Yeah, yeah.
- And I'm going out of town
this weekend...

59:41.178 --> 59:42.811
- Yeah.
- ...So it's not even
like I'm around.

59:42.813 --> 59:44.246
- You going out of town?
- Yeah.

59:44.248 --> 59:46.648
Jill and I are gonna
drive up to San Francisco.

59:46.650 --> 59:49.084
Cool.
That's nice, yeah.

59:49.086 --> 59:50.152
It's funny, my friend Eric
and I were actually

59:50.154 --> 59:51.286
gonna head out of town
this weekend.

59:51.288 --> 59:53.755
He was gonna show me
the bay area.

59:53.757 --> 59:55.290
- Really?
- Yeah, some of the sights.

59:55.292 --> 59:57.726
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

59:57.728 --> 01:00:00.629
Well, I mean,
i guess the four
of us could...

01:00:00.631 --> 01:00:01.730
- Yeah.
- ...Go together.

01:00:01.732 --> 01:00:03.298
- Yeah.
- If that's not too weird.

01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:03.298
No, no, I think that's cool
if it's cool with you guys.

01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:06.301
- Yeah.
- You know, it was
gonna be a guys' trip,

01:00:06.303 --> 01:00:08.170
but, um,
I'll check with him.

01:00:08.172 --> 01:00:10.105
- Hey.
- Hey, Jill, this is Eric,

01:00:10.107 --> 01:00:11.373
- Dean's friend.
- Hey.

01:00:11.375 --> 01:00:12.808
Uh, well, actually,
Dean's my friend.

01:00:12.810 --> 01:00:14.810
I'm kind of, like,
the main dude, I guess.

01:00:14.812 --> 01:00:16.645
Right, we got it.

01:00:16.647 --> 01:00:18.246
Oh, yeah?

01:00:18.248 --> 01:00:21.817
Well, okay, cool.
Are you guys doing good?

01:00:21.819 --> 01:00:23.218
Jill, you okay?

01:00:24.754 --> 01:00:26.321
Excuse me?

01:00:26.323 --> 01:00:26.321
I just, you know,
i didn't know.

01:00:26.323 --> 01:00:29.391
It seems like you're kind of,
like, upset or maybe,

01:00:29.393 --> 01:00:32.361
like, stressed out
about something, you know?

01:00:32.363 --> 01:00:33.862
No.

01:00:33.864 --> 01:00:35.864
Oh, oh, are you, like,

01:00:35.866 --> 01:00:38.200
one of those, like,
pickup artist dudes?

01:00:38.202 --> 01:00:40.202
Like, you're gonna,
like, take me down a peg,

01:00:40.204 --> 01:00:42.204
and then say
something like,

01:00:42.206 --> 01:00:45.207
"oh, that's so cool
how you're comfortable
being fat,"

01:00:45.209 --> 01:00:47.209
or something, and then
I'll feel bad about myself

01:00:47.211 --> 01:00:48.877
and sleep with you,
or something stupid?

01:00:50.246 --> 01:00:53.215
- Uh...
- No, he's--

01:00:53.217 --> 01:00:54.383
he's on the spectrum,
actually.

01:00:54.385 --> 01:00:56.818
He's got asperger's

01:00:56.820 --> 01:00:59.221
and he's not that great
at reading other people, so...

01:00:59.223 --> 01:01:01.723
Asper-- do I?

01:01:01.725 --> 01:01:04.226
He can't even read
himself, actually.

01:01:04.228 --> 01:01:06.228
It's okay, man.
Sorry.

01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:09.231
No, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

01:01:09.233 --> 01:01:12.234
I didn't mean
to just attack
you like that.

01:01:12.236 --> 01:01:14.202
I'm just-- I'm really
sick of guys trying to

01:01:14.204 --> 01:01:15.837
insecurize me into sleeping
with them, so I just--

01:01:15.839 --> 01:01:17.939
- yeah.
- I hear you.

01:01:17.941 --> 01:01:21.376
Yeah. Cool.

01:01:21.378 --> 01:01:23.378
Remember to make
eye contact if you can.

01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:24.913
- Thanks.
- Sure.

01:02:11.894 --> 01:02:14.296
Dean: All right.

01:02:14.298 --> 01:02:17.332
- So this is nature.
- Jill: Mm-hmm.

01:02:17.334 --> 01:02:17.332
Dean: All right, so let's talk
about our game plan.

01:02:17.334 --> 01:02:22.304
Nicky: All right. Um, I think
we're gonna go on a hike.

01:02:22.306 --> 01:02:25.273
- So what does that entail?

01:02:25.275 --> 01:02:27.242
Um, walking
along this trail?

01:02:27.244 --> 01:02:28.310
Ah, yeah,
now I can feel it.

01:02:28.312 --> 01:02:30.479
Hey, Toby. What?

01:02:32.448 --> 01:02:33.448
Well, what happened?

01:02:33.450 --> 01:02:35.751
Oh, Jesus.

01:02:35.753 --> 01:02:36.785
God.

01:02:38.488 --> 01:02:40.756
Toby knocked a bookshelf
on top of Nicholas,

01:02:40.758 --> 01:02:41.990
and he's in
critical condition.

01:02:41.992 --> 01:02:43.425
- Nicky: Oh, my god.
- Jill: Who's Nicholas?

01:02:43.427 --> 01:02:46.294
- It's his cat.
- He's not just a cat, okay?

01:02:46.296 --> 01:02:48.463
- Okay.
- You know he's not just a cat.

01:02:48.465 --> 01:02:50.766
- All right.
- Look, I'm sorry.

01:02:50.768 --> 01:02:52.334
I have to go to the airport
right now, okay?

01:02:52.336 --> 01:02:54.803
- I'm sorry.
- Dean: Eric?

01:02:54.805 --> 01:02:56.338
- No, just stay with him, okay?
- Hey.

01:02:56.340 --> 01:02:58.473
- I'm on my way.

01:02:58.475 --> 01:03:00.342
Eric: Guys,
i got to go now. I'm sorry.

01:03:00.344 --> 01:03:01.476
All right, all right,
all right.

01:03:01.478 --> 01:03:03.378
Dean:
<i> Hey, you've reached Dean.</i>

01:03:03.380 --> 01:03:03.378
<i> - I can't come to</i>
<i> my phone right now.</i>
- Thank you.

01:03:03.380 --> 01:03:06.548
<i> But here's my best</i>
<i> robot impression:</i>

01:03:06.550 --> 01:03:09.284
- - Hi, it's your dad.

01:03:09.286 --> 01:03:12.053
Um, please call me.
It's important.

01:03:12.055 --> 01:03:14.356
<i> I have some news.</i>

01:03:19.796 --> 01:03:21.363
- Whoa, whoa, hold on, hold on.
- What? What?

01:03:21.365 --> 01:03:22.898
Just take a breath.

01:03:22.900 --> 01:03:25.867
- He's gonna be okay.

01:03:25.869 --> 01:03:28.370
It's okay.
He's gonna be fine.

01:03:28.372 --> 01:03:30.438
I don't know what
I'm gonna do if he dies, okay?

01:03:31.407 --> 01:03:33.074
- He's not gonna die.
- Okay.

01:03:33.076 --> 01:03:35.377
All right?
Cats are resilient.

01:03:35.379 --> 01:03:36.845
Yeah, you're right.
You're right.

01:03:36.847 --> 01:03:39.381
Especially Nicholas.
He's got such a strong spirit.

01:03:39.383 --> 01:03:41.883
Yeah, yeah,
i got that from him.

01:03:41.885 --> 01:03:43.885
Yeah.
What about you?

01:03:43.887 --> 01:03:45.887
Um, you know,
i haven't gotten to know

01:03:45.889 --> 01:03:49.524
- Nicholas that well, but, yeah.
- No, no, I mean you and her.

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:55.397
Nicky?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

01:03:55.399 --> 01:03:58.033
All right, just be slow
and be cool, okay?

01:03:58.035 --> 01:04:00.335
Yeah.

01:04:00.337 --> 01:04:01.503
- All right?
- Yeah, I'll be cool.

01:04:01.505 --> 01:04:04.039
- All right, come here.
- All right.

01:04:04.041 --> 01:04:06.341
Take care of yourself, man.

01:04:22.325 --> 01:04:24.893
Sorry that you
can't crash with us.

01:04:24.895 --> 01:04:26.862
Jill's mom is really weird
about having guys over.

01:04:26.864 --> 01:04:29.431
No, it's fine, I wouldn't
want me over there anyway.

01:04:29.433 --> 01:04:30.899
Oh, yeah?
Why's that?

01:04:30.901 --> 01:04:33.335
I'm a bed-wetter.

01:04:33.337 --> 01:04:35.437
- Really?
- Yeah. I don't pee in the bed.

01:04:35.439 --> 01:04:36.938
It's more into it
from a short distance,

01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:38.440
but it's kind of
the same thing.

01:04:38.442 --> 01:04:40.375
- You're such a dork.
- I thought that was funny.

01:04:41.143 --> 01:04:42.911
It was okay.

01:04:45.382 --> 01:04:47.148
Thank you, Jill.
Thank you for that.

01:04:47.150 --> 01:04:50.051
Drive safely.

01:04:50.053 --> 01:04:52.487
I'll be thinking of you
as I pee into my bed tonight.

01:04:53.956 --> 01:04:55.423
Ladies.

01:05:10.673 --> 01:05:12.674
Robert: <i> Hello,</i>
<i> you have reached Robert.</i>

01:05:12.676 --> 01:05:14.476
<i> Sorry I missed your call.</i>

01:05:14.478 --> 01:05:16.478
<i> Please leave a message,</i>
<i> and I'll do my best</i>

01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:17.946
<i> to return it as soon as I can.</i>

01:05:23.153 --> 01:05:24.986
Yes?

01:05:27.623 --> 01:05:29.925
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:05:29.927 --> 01:05:31.559
- What are you doing here?
- Well...

01:05:31.561 --> 01:05:33.094
I was on my way to Jill's
and I realized

01:05:33.096 --> 01:05:36.097
- that I forgot something.
- You forgot something?

01:05:36.099 --> 01:05:37.666
Sorry,
I'm not very good at improv.

01:05:37.668 --> 01:05:39.567
No, it was really sexy.

01:05:42.471 --> 01:05:44.039
- Come on in.
- Okay.

01:05:45.041 --> 01:05:46.708
Oh, look at this
disgusting place.

01:05:46.710 --> 01:05:48.944
Dean: Pretty gross, huh?

01:05:48.946 --> 01:05:50.679
What about that play?
What'd you think?

01:05:52.615 --> 01:05:54.582
It was so great.

01:05:54.584 --> 01:05:55.717
- Wasn't it?
- Thank you.

01:05:55.719 --> 01:05:58.153
Yeah, it was--
it was, uh...

01:05:58.155 --> 01:06:01.523
- Very complex and interesting.
- The performances were amazing.

01:06:01.525 --> 01:06:02.691
- Great performances.
- Wow.

01:06:02.693 --> 01:06:04.559
Yup, yup.

01:06:04.561 --> 01:06:07.529
Good production.

01:06:07.531 --> 01:06:10.565
- Worth that money.

01:06:10.567 --> 01:06:13.001
Yeah.

01:06:13.003 --> 01:06:14.669
Okay, I have
a confession to make.

01:06:14.671 --> 01:06:17.605
I didn't understand
most of what we saw
in that theater.

01:06:17.607 --> 01:06:19.107
- I'm sorry.
- Oh.

01:06:19.109 --> 01:06:20.575
I looked over at you,
and you looked like

01:06:20.577 --> 01:06:22.110
- you were utterly engrossed.
- I know, I'm sorry.

01:06:22.112 --> 01:06:26.748
- I just-- I didn't get it. I--
- well...

01:06:26.750 --> 01:06:29.551
I didn't understand a thing.

01:06:29.553 --> 01:06:31.019
- Really?
- Not a thing.

01:06:31.021 --> 01:06:32.754
What? Were they--

01:06:32.756 --> 01:06:35.056
- what was that?
- Was it about time travel?

01:06:35.058 --> 01:06:37.692
No, that--
those, I think,
were flashbacks.

01:06:37.694 --> 01:06:40.161
That was her
as a younger woman.

01:06:40.163 --> 01:06:42.197
- That was the same?
- Yes, that was the same woman.

01:06:42.199 --> 01:06:44.466
Ah, that doesn't help.

01:06:44.468 --> 01:06:45.700
It was fun.
I'm glad we went.

01:06:45.702 --> 01:06:48.570
It was an incredible
production of just a...

01:06:48.572 --> 01:06:50.572
- Of a crazy...
- ...Terrible, terrible play.

01:06:50.574 --> 01:06:52.741
- ...crazy-ass play, yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

01:06:52.743 --> 01:06:55.276
Well...

01:07:06.188 --> 01:07:07.722
Well, good night.

01:07:07.724 --> 01:07:10.158
Would you like to
come up for a coffee?

01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:12.560
Yes. I'd love to.

01:07:15.064 --> 01:07:16.131
Oh, man.

01:07:16.133 --> 01:07:20.135
Okay, you're not allowed
to judge my apartment.

01:07:20.137 --> 01:07:21.603
I didn't know
you were coming in,

01:07:21.605 --> 01:07:23.605
and there's papers
all over the table, so...

01:07:23.607 --> 01:07:25.640
Sure.

01:07:31.714 --> 01:07:34.149
I-I'm sorry. I, um...

01:07:36.620 --> 01:07:39.754
I'm sort of stuck here.
I don't think I can...

01:07:39.756 --> 01:07:42.624
I shouldn't have, uh,

01:07:42.626 --> 01:07:44.225
made the first move.

01:07:44.227 --> 01:07:46.194
I think I was too forward.

01:07:46.196 --> 01:07:47.595
No, no, no, no, no.

01:07:47.597 --> 01:07:49.130
I, uh,
i don't know what it is,

01:07:49.132 --> 01:07:51.666
but it's...

01:07:51.668 --> 01:07:53.334
I really like you.

01:07:53.336 --> 01:07:55.336
No, and...

01:07:55.338 --> 01:07:56.771
But?

01:08:00.109 --> 01:08:02.677
But--
well, truth is...

01:08:06.782 --> 01:08:09.617
I don't quite know who I am.

01:08:11.187 --> 01:08:13.088
You know, since...

01:08:16.759 --> 01:08:19.694
Since my...
My wife, uh...

01:08:21.663 --> 01:08:23.631
- Oh.
- Do you understand?

01:08:25.267 --> 01:08:26.701
- I mean...
- It's okay.

01:08:26.703 --> 01:08:28.368
It seemed like
such a good idea.

01:08:28.371 --> 01:08:30.270
- Of course.
- Um...

01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:32.874
- I get it.
- Um...

01:08:34.376 --> 01:08:36.644
That is just my luck, man.

01:08:38.214 --> 01:08:41.149
I finally meet a guy
i really like

01:08:41.151 --> 01:08:44.652
and turns out
he's married.

01:08:47.389 --> 01:08:48.890
I guess that's it, yeah.

01:08:53.328 --> 01:08:54.796
Good night, Robert.

01:09:26.162 --> 01:09:28.296
Nicky?

01:09:28.298 --> 01:09:30.430
- Hmm?
- You awake?

01:09:30.433 --> 01:09:32.433
Mm-hmm.

01:09:32.435 --> 01:09:34.669
Oh, okay.

01:09:38.908 --> 01:09:40.274
Hey.

01:09:42.211 --> 01:09:44.746
I was just realizing
that I, um...

01:09:44.747 --> 01:09:46.481
I forgot to mention
something to you...

01:09:47.883 --> 01:09:49.484
That I probably
should have told you.

01:09:50.352 --> 01:09:51.452
What?

01:09:52.921 --> 01:09:54.221
Um...

01:09:56.358 --> 01:09:57.825
I was engaged.

01:09:59.461 --> 01:10:01.462
Yeah, not anymore.

01:10:01.464 --> 01:10:03.698
We broke up
a few months ago, but...

01:10:04.767 --> 01:10:07.335
I realized I never said
anything to you about it,

01:10:07.337 --> 01:10:10.238
so I figured I should
tell you, you know?

01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:13.775
My mom was sick,
and I guess I wanted her

01:10:13.777 --> 01:10:15.877
to know that
i found my person.

01:10:15.879 --> 01:10:18.279
So I think if my mom
hadn't gotten sick,

01:10:18.281 --> 01:10:20.782
then Michelle and I

01:10:20.784 --> 01:10:22.250
probably wouldn't have
even gotten engaged.

01:10:22.252 --> 01:10:23.985
We probably would have
broken up a while ago,

01:10:23.987 --> 01:10:26.487
but I thought
i should just tell you.

01:10:26.489 --> 01:10:28.790
Is your mom okay now?

01:10:30.459 --> 01:10:31.793
Uh...

01:10:32.494 --> 01:10:33.761
No.

01:10:34.863 --> 01:10:37.498
No, she's not, but...

01:10:39.501 --> 01:10:42.804
- I'm so sorry.
- Oh, no, no, it's...

01:10:42.806 --> 01:10:44.505
I'm fine, thanks.
I appreciate it.

01:10:46.342 --> 01:10:47.508
Yeah, I haven't really
wanted to talk about it

01:10:47.510 --> 01:10:49.744
so much since she died,

01:10:49.746 --> 01:10:52.247
but I don't know.

01:10:52.249 --> 01:10:55.016
I feel like
i can talk to you.

01:10:55.018 --> 01:10:57.418
It's funny, I didn't even want
to come out to California,

01:10:57.420 --> 01:10:59.954
and then I met you,

01:10:59.956 --> 01:11:02.824
and now I feel like it
kind of makes sense,

01:11:02.826 --> 01:11:06.027
like, why I ended up out
here in the first place.

01:11:07.896 --> 01:11:09.764
I'm glad I met you.

01:11:14.436 --> 01:11:15.837
You know,
while we're talking,

01:11:15.839 --> 01:11:17.905
I probably should
tell you one other thing.

01:11:20.476 --> 01:11:22.910
I'm pretty sure I'm falling
in love with you.

01:11:26.548 --> 01:11:28.916
What?

01:11:28.918 --> 01:11:30.351
I said-- I mean...

01:11:32.988 --> 01:11:35.590
- I think you're great.
- Uh...

01:11:35.592 --> 01:11:37.458
Okay, well-well,
thank you.

01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:38.459
- That's...
- Sure.

01:11:38.461 --> 01:11:39.861
That's a really...

01:11:39.863 --> 01:11:41.529
...that's a really
lovely thing to say.

01:11:48.904 --> 01:11:51.439
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:12:33.382 --> 01:12:35.883
Okay, you ready?

01:12:36.618 --> 01:12:38.653
- Yeah.
- Good.

01:12:38.655 --> 01:12:40.822
How do I look?

01:12:40.824 --> 01:12:43.925
Um, you look a little stiff.

01:12:43.927 --> 01:12:45.393
It's okay,
just take a deep breath.

01:12:45.395 --> 01:12:46.894
- Yeah, thanks.
- Take a deep breath, okay?

01:12:49.599 --> 01:12:51.899
Okay, well, my mom's
gonna be really excited.

01:12:51.901 --> 01:12:51.899
Yeah.

01:12:51.901 --> 01:12:54.669
My dad says she's having
a good day today.

01:12:54.671 --> 01:12:56.971
- I thought I heard voices.
- Michelle: Hello.

01:13:00.075 --> 01:13:02.643
- Hey.
- Hi. You need a haircut.

01:13:02.645 --> 01:13:05.680
Oh, Michelle brought
your favorite flowers.

01:13:05.682 --> 01:13:09.851
And she's got something
on her finger.

01:13:09.853 --> 01:13:13.588
- Yup. All right, let's...

01:13:13.590 --> 01:13:15.957
- Hi.
- Michelle: Hello.

01:13:15.959 --> 01:13:19.160
Dean: Happy birthday.
How are you?

01:13:38.647 --> 01:13:40.715
Sir? You have a note.

01:13:41.683 --> 01:13:43.184
Thanks.

01:13:48.424 --> 01:13:49.991
Nicky: <i> Dear Dean,</i>

01:13:49.993 --> 01:13:49.991
<i> I didn't want to wake you</i>
<i> up this morning,</i>

01:13:49.993 --> 01:13:54.495
<i> so I thought I'd leave you</i>
<i> a note, 20th century style.</i>

01:13:55.697 --> 01:13:58.900
<i>I realized I haven't been</i>
<i> completely honest</i>

01:13:58.902 --> 01:13:58.900
<i> with you, either.</i>

01:13:58.902 --> 01:14:02.603
<i> Last night</i>
<i> when we were talking in bed</i>

01:14:02.605 --> 01:14:05.473
<i> there was something</i>
<i> I should have told you.</i>

01:14:05.475 --> 01:14:08.476
<i> The truth is, I'm married.</i>

01:14:10.212 --> 01:14:13.147
<i> It looks weird even writing it</i>
<i> because we're separated</i>

01:14:13.149 --> 01:14:15.716
<i> and have been for some time,</i>

01:14:15.718 --> 01:14:18.686
<i> but it's still something</i>
<i> we're trying to figure out.</i>

01:14:18.688 --> 01:14:21.756
<i> The night that I met you,</i>
<i> my husband Jeremy</i>

01:14:21.758 --> 01:14:23.491
<i> actually came to that party.</i>

01:14:23.493 --> 01:14:25.460
Uh, Todd's outside,
and he's here with Jeremy.

01:14:25.462 --> 01:14:27.528
I'm sorry. I got to go.
It was lovely meeting you.

01:14:27.530 --> 01:14:30.164
Yeah, those guys are here,
so you should go.

01:14:32.468 --> 01:14:34.035
Nicky:
<i> I enjoyed hanging out with you</i>

01:14:34.037 --> 01:14:36.938
<i> and didn't think</i>
<i> much beyond that,</i>

01:14:36.940 --> 01:14:39.173
<i> and then things just happened.</i>

01:14:41.043 --> 01:14:43.945
<i>Along the way Jill kept telling</i>
<i> me I should talk to you.</i>

01:14:43.947 --> 01:14:46.047
<i> She felt like</i>
<i> I was leading you on,</i>

01:14:46.049 --> 01:14:49.083
<i> but I couldn't find</i>
<i>the right moment to bring it up.</i>

01:14:50.652 --> 01:14:52.186
<i> For what it's worth,</i>

01:14:52.188 --> 01:14:54.655
<i> I thought we were</i>
<i> just having fun.</i>

01:14:54.657 --> 01:14:56.524
<i> I guess I was</i>
<i> trying to run away</i>

01:14:56.526 --> 01:14:58.759
<i> from all the heaviness</i>
<i> in my life.</i>

01:14:58.761 --> 01:15:00.995
<i> I hope that makes sense.</i>

01:15:03.065 --> 01:15:05.166
<i> I just have a lot</i>
<i> I still need to deal with.</i>

01:15:07.202 --> 01:15:09.036
<i> Maybe we both do.</i>

01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:14.208
<i> I hope you find</i>
<i> what you're looking for.</i>

01:15:14.210 --> 01:15:16.277
<i> Let me know when you do.</i>

01:15:16.279 --> 01:15:18.613
<i> Maybe we'll be on</i>
<i> the same road by then.</i>

01:15:18.615 --> 01:15:21.148
<i> Either way,</i>
<i> I'm still glad I met you.</i>

01:15:22.551 --> 01:15:25.987
<i> Take care of yourself, Nicky.</i>

01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:54.609
I just don't know
what you're doing.

01:16:58.347 --> 01:17:00.247
What am I supposed to be doing?

01:17:01.683 --> 01:17:04.619
I just took a trip,
and now I'm here.

01:17:04.621 --> 01:17:06.787
Even when you're here,
you're not here.

01:17:06.789 --> 01:17:10.257
Wherever you are,
i need you to come back.

01:17:11.761 --> 01:17:14.895
Okay, um, to where?

01:17:14.897 --> 01:17:16.764
Should I come home maybe?

01:17:16.766 --> 01:17:20.201
Oh, I forgot.
You sold our house.

01:17:20.203 --> 01:17:23.304
You sold mom's house while
i was away, so that's gone.

01:17:23.306 --> 01:17:25.906
Oh, I see.
I get it.

01:17:25.908 --> 01:17:27.642
I see the problem.

01:17:27.644 --> 01:17:29.343
What exactly
did you want me to do?

01:17:29.345 --> 01:17:31.912
Just go on
living there alone?

01:17:33.215 --> 01:17:35.149
No, I don't know
what I want you to do.

01:17:35.151 --> 01:17:38.219
I just-- I want to stop
living under this cloud.

01:17:38.221 --> 01:17:40.688
I want to stop talking
about life and death

01:17:40.690 --> 01:17:42.690
and how I'm not
grieving right.

01:17:42.692 --> 01:17:45.926
We're not helping each other,
so why don't we just stop?

01:17:45.928 --> 01:17:47.395
Okay.

01:17:47.397 --> 01:17:49.764
No, I think that
sounds very healthy.

01:17:49.766 --> 01:17:51.899
I'm glad we had this talk.

01:18:21.229 --> 01:18:22.863
Dean: Listen,
i wanted to apologize

01:18:22.865 --> 01:18:23.964
for my performance
at your wedding.

01:18:23.966 --> 01:18:25.833
Brett: Oh, dude, stop.

01:18:25.835 --> 01:18:27.268
No, I feel like I was a little
out of control there,

01:18:27.270 --> 01:18:29.737
and seeing Michelle
kind of threw me,

01:18:29.739 --> 01:18:33.741
and I don't know.
I'm sorry.

01:18:33.743 --> 01:18:35.476
- Thanks.
- Don't worry about it.

01:18:38.747 --> 01:18:41.415
- Hey, how's your dad doing?
- He's okay, I guess.

01:18:41.417 --> 01:18:42.717
We don't talk much
these days, but,

01:18:42.719 --> 01:18:44.919
you know,
he's got his therapist,

01:18:44.921 --> 01:18:46.020
so I guess he's fine.

01:18:49.291 --> 01:18:50.491
Yeah, I remember
after my dad died.

01:18:52.761 --> 01:18:55.496
My whole family practically,
you know, disintegrated,

01:18:55.498 --> 01:18:57.364
and I was just...

01:18:57.366 --> 01:18:59.834
I think a year after

01:18:59.836 --> 01:19:02.002
was somehow harder
than right after.

01:19:02.004 --> 01:19:04.305
Yeah, definitely.

01:19:05.807 --> 01:19:07.308
You know, people...

01:19:07.310 --> 01:19:09.777
They don't think about it
when they see you,

01:19:09.779 --> 01:19:11.345
don't ask how you're doing
or think that you might

01:19:11.347 --> 01:19:13.380
actually feel worse now
than you did then.

01:19:14.783 --> 01:19:16.417
You realize the world
just keeps on going.

01:19:17.986 --> 01:19:19.954
It doesn't really care.

01:19:19.956 --> 01:19:21.355
What about now?

01:19:24.326 --> 01:19:26.026
I don't know.
I mean, it was so long ago now.

01:19:28.296 --> 01:19:30.464
Sometimes I'll fantasize
about it, you know?

01:19:30.466 --> 01:19:32.366
What would it be like
if he hadn't died?

01:19:34.770 --> 01:19:38.038
We're never gonna
not miss them, you know?

01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:40.374
First big thing
in your life that
you're never gonna get over.

01:19:42.410 --> 01:19:45.012
- It sucks.
- It sucks.

01:19:46.047 --> 01:19:47.948
Yeah.

01:19:47.950 --> 01:19:49.850
Look, man,

01:19:49.852 --> 01:19:52.086
whatever's going on
with you and your dad,

01:19:52.088 --> 01:19:55.422
just remember to go easy
on each other, okay?

01:20:01.429 --> 01:20:03.497
You hungry?

01:20:03.499 --> 01:20:05.399
- Not really.
- Yeah, me neither.

01:20:07.369 --> 01:20:09.470
- Want to eat?
- Yeah.

01:20:09.472 --> 01:20:10.871
Okay, let's go.

01:20:19.381 --> 01:20:22.082
Voice mail: <i> Next saved message.</i>

01:20:22.084 --> 01:20:24.318
Karen: <i> Hey, honey, mom here.</i>

01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:26.387
<i> I just got your message,</i>
<i> and i--</i>

01:20:26.389 --> 01:20:28.088
<i> I just want to say</i>
<i> don't worry.</i>

01:20:28.090 --> 01:20:30.057
<i> Take a deep breath.</i>

01:20:30.059 --> 01:20:31.826
<i> I know you can do it.</i>

01:20:31.828 --> 01:20:34.461
<i> Oh, and don't forget to eat.</i>
<i> Okay, love you.</i>

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:20.234
Dean: So have you met
your neighbors?

01:22:21.102 --> 01:22:22.937
No, not officially,

01:22:22.939 --> 01:22:25.639
but, uh, a lot of
their dogs have,

01:22:25.641 --> 01:22:27.141
uh, become acquainted
with my crotch.

01:22:29.244 --> 01:22:31.045
I always liked that picture
of you and mom.

01:22:31.713 --> 01:22:33.180
Yeah, me, too.

01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:40.220
Nice view.

01:22:40.222 --> 01:22:42.056
Yeah, yeah.

01:22:42.058 --> 01:22:43.657
And if you put your cheek
against the window,

01:22:43.659 --> 01:22:44.725
you can see central park.

01:22:48.997 --> 01:22:52.066
Yeah, that's nice.

01:22:52.068 --> 01:22:54.268
Yeah, leaves will be
changing soon.

01:22:59.541 --> 01:23:02.609
Uh, dad,
i wanted to talk to you.

01:23:04.746 --> 01:23:06.580
About the house?

01:23:06.582 --> 01:23:08.682
No.

01:23:08.684 --> 01:23:10.217
You were right.

01:23:10.219 --> 01:23:13.087
I... I disappeared
there for a while.

01:23:13.089 --> 01:23:15.255
It's okay.
You don't need to apologize.

01:23:16.191 --> 01:23:17.291
No, I do.

01:23:17.293 --> 01:23:19.626
I was running
and I'm sorry.

01:23:20.628 --> 01:23:22.129
I just...

01:23:32.173 --> 01:23:34.508
You know, I think
about mom every day.

01:23:34.510 --> 01:23:36.577
I'll pass that bookstore
where we used to meet up,

01:23:36.579 --> 01:23:40.147
or smell her perfume,
or just...

01:23:40.149 --> 01:23:42.282
It's just...

01:23:42.284 --> 01:23:44.518
She's everywhere,
you know?

01:23:46.054 --> 01:23:47.287
No matter what I do,

01:23:47.289 --> 01:23:49.323
I just keep thinking
about her every day.

01:23:51.292 --> 01:23:52.760
Even when I try not to.

01:23:55.130 --> 01:23:58.132
So many things remind me
of her, and, uh...

01:23:59.134 --> 01:24:02.603
Dad, I can't even imagine
what you've been going through.

01:24:02.605 --> 01:24:05.539
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

01:24:05.541 --> 01:24:08.342
- It's okay. I know. I know.

01:24:09.177 --> 01:24:10.310
- It's okay.
- I'm sorry.

01:24:10.312 --> 01:24:11.678
No. No, no.

01:24:17.286 --> 01:24:18.819
Sit down.

01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:26.560
I'm worried about you.

01:24:27.762 --> 01:24:29.696
I know you are,

01:24:29.698 --> 01:24:32.166
but don't worry
about me.

01:24:32.168 --> 01:24:33.333
I'm gonna be fine.

01:24:34.669 --> 01:24:36.236
I'm not sure when,

01:24:36.238 --> 01:24:38.639
but I'm sure
I'm gonna be fine.

01:24:38.641 --> 01:24:42.242
- Yeah.
- I miss your mom...

01:24:42.244 --> 01:24:44.144
A lot.

01:24:44.146 --> 01:24:46.346
That's not gonna stop,

01:24:46.348 --> 01:24:49.650
but I can't tell you
how lucky I feel

01:24:49.652 --> 01:24:51.718
that I got to be with her
as long as I did.

01:24:53.154 --> 01:24:55.856
- Yeah.
- And how lucky I feel
that we had you.

01:24:57.659 --> 01:24:59.593
It's good
to have you back.

01:25:02.664 --> 01:25:04.665
Don't you disappear
on me, okay?

01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:07.234
I won't.

01:25:08.803 --> 01:25:10.671
You, too.

01:25:10.673 --> 01:25:12.873
- Oh, I'm not gonna disappear.
- Okay.

01:25:13.775 --> 01:25:15.676
You know where to find me.

01:25:15.678 --> 01:25:18.645
- I'm here. It's a deal.
- Okay.

01:25:23.384 --> 01:25:24.685
And, um...

01:25:27.188 --> 01:25:29.389
Let me share
something with you.

01:25:34.395 --> 01:25:36.697
Dean: <i> Dear Eric,</i>

01:25:36.699 --> 01:25:38.799
<i> I'm so sorry for your loss.</i>

01:25:38.801 --> 01:25:41.235
<i> I know Nicholas</i>
<i> was more than a cat,</i>

01:25:41.237 --> 01:25:43.170
<i> he was a good friend</i>

01:25:43.172 --> 01:25:45.205
<i> and he offered you</i>
<i> great support.</i>

01:25:45.207 --> 01:25:48.275
<i> Losing him probably feels like</i>
<i> losing a part of yourself.</i>

01:25:48.277 --> 01:25:50.677
<i> I've been there.</i>

01:25:50.679 --> 01:25:52.613
<i> In the coming months,</i>
<i> you might feel</i>

01:25:52.615 --> 01:25:54.681
<i> more lost than you do now</i>

01:25:54.683 --> 01:25:54.681
<i> and you might feel like</i>
<i> you need to run away</i>

01:25:54.683 --> 01:25:58.418
<i> from all the heaviness</i>
<i> for a while.</i>

01:25:58.420 --> 01:26:01.722
<i> Maybe you'll fly across</i>
<i>the country to escape the pain,</i>

01:26:01.724 --> 01:26:04.725
<i> and maybe while you're away</i>
<i> your dad will go and sell</i>

01:26:04.727 --> 01:26:06.727
<i> all of your cat furniture,</i>

01:26:06.729 --> 01:26:09.863
<i> the last real link you thought</i>
<i> you had to Nicholas.</i>

01:26:09.865 --> 01:26:11.698
<i> It might be hard</i>
<i> to understand now,</i>

01:26:11.700 --> 01:26:13.734
<i> but maybe your dad did it</i>

01:26:13.736 --> 01:26:16.370
<i> because he just needed</i>
<i> to do it to move forward.</i>

01:26:18.339 --> 01:26:20.174
<i> I wish there was something</i>
<i> I could say</i>

01:26:20.176 --> 01:26:21.742
<i> that would make you</i>
<i> feel better,</i>

01:26:21.744 --> 01:26:24.378
<i> but the hard truth</i>
<i> is that Nicholas is gone,</i>

01:26:24.380 --> 01:26:26.280
<i> and there's nothing</i>
<i> that will bring him back.</i>

01:26:26.282 --> 01:26:29.216
<i> Not old cat furniture,</i>
<i> personal belongings,</i>

01:26:29.218 --> 01:26:31.785
<i> or even voice messages</i>
<i> from him</i>

01:26:31.787 --> 01:26:33.387
<i> that you've carefully saved.</i>

01:26:35.323 --> 01:26:38.292
<i> Nothing can replace him,</i>

01:26:38.294 --> 01:26:40.427
<i> but that doesn't mean</i>
<i> you won't be okay again.</i>

01:26:42.764 --> 01:26:45.199
<i> You know,</i>
<i> when you lose someone,</i>

01:26:45.201 --> 01:26:47.701
<i> it can make you</i>
<i> feel so alone...</i>

01:26:49.771 --> 01:26:50.837
<i> But there's one thing</i>
<i> I've learned...</i>

01:26:53.741 --> 01:26:57.311
<i> If you really love them,</i>
<i> you never lose them.</i>

01:27:00.315 --> 01:27:02.783
<i> Especially if they had</i>
<i> a strong spirit.</i>

01:27:05.753 --> 01:27:09.389
<i> Anyway, here's a copy</i>
<i> of my new book.</i>

01:27:09.391 --> 01:27:10.924
<i> I can't say</i>
<i> it holds any answers,</i>

01:27:10.926 --> 01:27:12.926
<i> but maybe</i>
<i> it'll give you a laugh</i>

01:27:12.928 --> 01:27:14.494
<i> and that's worth something.</i>

01:27:15.697 --> 01:27:17.497
<i> Take care of yourself, buddy.</i>

01:27:17.499 --> 01:27:19.533
<i> Your friend, Dean.</i>
