Could somebody shut off those rats?

02:35.030 --> 02:39.524
Oh, no, no, they're not rats.
They're meerkats and they are so cute!

- Uh... it is 6:47.

You listen to their assessment

05:26.493 --> 05:28.279
Pidge said I needed some drama on my face.

05:28.370 --> 05:31.954
It was this or mascara, and I don't like
shit around my eyes 'cause I got allergies

05:32.040 --> 05:34.532

one of them girls who cry.

- Oh, it's good. Yeah, cute.
- Yeah, mmm-hmm.

05:36.878 --> 05:38.414
Uh, I'm totally liking it.

05:39.172 --> 05:42.415
You should try doing the prune lips
like an Olsen twin does.

05:42.509 --> 05:43.670
[Flaca] Mmm.

05:43.760 --> 05:46.092

05:51.893 --> 05:55.636
Well, if you don't like my face,
maybe you'll like this! [chuckling]

05:55.730 --> 05:58.893
[Maritza] Oh, my God!
Shit.

05:58.984 --> 06:02.818

children or naked buttholes.

Why are you walking like you're 90?

06:09.119 --> 06:12.783
[Piper] Because we slept in
a digger bucket, and I can't feel my neck.

06:12.873 --> 06:17.117
I once dated a girl named Digger.
Her parents ran a cemetery.

06:17.210 --> 06:18.826
She stole me a ring off a corpse.

06:18.920 --> 06:22.663
How romantic.
Illegal and creepy, but very romantic.

06:22.757 --> 06:24.623
She left me
for a professional water-skier.

06:24.718 --> 06:27.460
She said she was the only woman
who ever looked hot in a life vest.

06:27.554 --> 06:28.589
How do you fight that?

06:28.680 --> 06:31.342
I think we need more padding.
Like a base layer.

06:31.433 --> 06:34.767
You know, like a...
like a tarp or something.

06:34.853 --> 06:36.514
Whoa. I didn't even ask you
to move in, Pipes.

06:36.605 --> 06:38.892
That's, uh... that's pretty presumptuous.

06:38.982 --> 06:42.771
Alex Vause,
may I put my prison-issue mattress

06:42.861 --> 06:48.573
next to your bulldozer scoopie thingy,
and ride out a nightmare with you?

06:48.658 --> 06:49.819
You may.

06:54.873 --> 06:56.739
Will I not like you
when you get very angry?

06:56.833 --> 06:57.823
[Alex] I'm repurposing.

06:59.419 --> 07:00.500
Huh.

07:01.880 --> 07:04.713
Do you want me to help you
rip off the other one?

07:04.799 --> 07:06.836
Is it driving you crazy?

07:06.927 --> 07:08.042
No.

07:09.596 --> 07:11.587
Yes.
You know that I need symmetry!

07:11.681 --> 07:14.343
- It's hard to look at, huh?
- Now you're just being a bully.

07:15.101 --> 07:19.516
Okay, fine.
This is a gift for you.

07:19.606 --> 07:21.438
It's no corpse ring, but it'll have to do.

07:25.612 --> 07:29.822
Daya!
Hey, I've been looking for you.

07:29.908 --> 07:31.490
You found something to eat okay?

07:31.576 --> 07:33.362
Why, you wanna jack me for my Pop-Tart?

07:33.453 --> 07:36.161
Hey. I know you don't understand
what I did or why I did it, but--

07:36.247 --> 07:37.658
You're right.
I don't understand.

07:37.749 --> 07:40.161
This whole fucking time
you didn't say nothing.

07:40.251 --> 07:42.913
And you fucking hit me in my head.
I could have a football injury.

07:43.004 --> 07:45.541
- I got a wicked headache.
- You shot a guard.

07:45.632 --> 07:47.794
You weren't acting
like a responsible gun owner.

07:47.884 --> 07:49.466
I don't care.

07:49.552 --> 07:51.042
- I don't care if he dies.
- And I do?

07:51.137 --> 07:52.969
We all think about
taking down these cabrones,

07:53.056 --> 07:56.299
but we don't act on it
'cause we got things to live for.

07:56.393 --> 07:58.509
You gotta get outta here
and see your girl.

07:58.603 --> 07:59.638
[Dayanara huffs]

07:59.729 --> 08:02.437
[mimics Dayanara] Look at me. Hey.

08:04.734 --> 08:07.396
You need to take a timeout, okay?

08:07.487 --> 08:10.070
Why don't you help me clean up?
We could do it together.

08:10.156 --> 08:12.488
Busy hands could help
clear your head, huh?

08:13.535 --> 08:15.947
My head hurts, all right?

08:16.037 --> 08:18.404
I want nothing to do with you.

08:19.416 --> 08:20.872
Maybe your shadow
can help you play cleanup.

08:21.668 --> 08:24.126
- My what?
- Good morning.

08:24.212 --> 08:25.202
What's for breakfast?

08:28.008 --> 08:29.339
You're looking at it.

08:29.426 --> 08:32.214
Um, no. I'm not.

08:32.303 --> 08:36.011
Breakfast is supposed to be served
between 4:30 and 7:00.

08:36.099 --> 08:39.091
Today's offerings should include
a hot grits,

08:39.184 --> 08:42.678
a whole wheat bread or coffee cake,
a margarine pat and skim milk.

08:42.772 --> 08:46.356
- Sometimes there's a surprise, like--
- Okay, yeah. Breakfast is canceled.

08:51.364 --> 08:53.901
Breakfast is canceled...

08:56.119 --> 08:57.109
Fine.

09:06.963 --> 09:09.580
Breakfast, okay?

09:09.674 --> 09:12.883
Oh! Thank you! [chuckles]

09:12.969 --> 09:14.551
This is the surprise, for sure.

09:14.637 --> 09:18.301
Um, by any chance,
will there be a spoon made available?

09:19.809 --> 09:21.140
[sighs]

09:23.605 --> 09:26.848
Yeah, I'll get one.
Sit down.

09:41.706 --> 09:42.741
[grunts]

09:44.042 --> 09:45.123
Oh, what the hell.

09:50.840 --> 09:53.252
Okay. Pick a color.
You want gel?

09:53.343 --> 09:55.209
Uh, no. Um...

09:56.513 --> 09:58.800
- I want to apply for a job here.
-[woman] Hmm?

09:58.890 --> 10:02.053

- It's meter parking, yeah.

10:02.143 --> 10:03.929
No. [chuckles]

10:04.020 --> 10:07.388
I want to work here.
Do nails.

10:08.358 --> 10:10.315
I do manicures.
I did these.

10:11.361 --> 10:12.726
Oh.

10:14.030 --> 10:17.898
Exacfly.
I'm a fuckin' artist with this shit.

10:17.992 --> 10:20.825
I did my toes, too.
See that?

10:20.912 --> 10:24.121
Cheetah.
You know... [roars]

10:24.207 --> 10:25.447
Yes. Good.

10:25.542 --> 10:28.910
- Great. So how much you paying me?
- Twenty dollars a day.

10:29.003 --> 10:30.960
What? Uh-uh.

10:31.047 --> 10:32.663
- That's way too low.
- No, no, no.

10:32.757 --> 10:35.340
You pay me to train.

10:35.426 --> 10:36.882
- To train?
- Mmm-hmm.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.381
In what?

10:38.471 --> 10:40.303
I'd buff circles
around these sashimi bitches.

10:42.058 --> 10:44.095
Two weeks train, or you go now.

10:45.603 --> 10:49.096
You know what, you can shit up a rope
with your $20 a day.

10:49.190 --> 10:50.646
And it's your loss.

10:50.733 --> 10:53.191
I would have had this place packed,
with lines out the door.

10:53.278 --> 10:55.019
Charging people to work?

10:55.113 --> 10:58.777
This is America, lady.
Slavery ain't legal here!

11:06.958 --> 11:09.871
Mei... are you in here against your will?

11:14.048 --> 11:16.540
[Sankey] Come on, slave!
We're hangry!

11:16.634 --> 11:20.127
How long does it take to fry,
poach and scramble some damn eggs?

11:20.221 --> 11:23.805
Ladies, I am moving as fast as I can.
You know, all I have is powdered eggs.

11:23.892 --> 11:25.724
Did we say you could talk?

11:25.810 --> 11:27.721
Yeah, just make it rain, King.

11:27.812 --> 11:29.223
What the fuck did y'all do?

11:29.314 --> 11:31.931
Did y'all see the news?
They think y'all terrorists!

11:32.025 --> 11:33.311
We know. We saw.

11:33.401 --> 11:34.812
And they had no right
to call us bin Ladens

11:34.903 --> 11:36.610
without checking who we were
under those Ewok hats.

11:36.696 --> 11:38.778
- The whole thing's totally offensive.
- Fuckin' media.

11:38.865 --> 11:42.483
What's offensive is that a photograph
of two idiots wearing hijabs

11:42.577 --> 11:44.443
automatically gets labelled as terrorism.

11:44.537 --> 11:46.448
[Black Cindy] Hey, do I smell eggs?

11:46.539 --> 11:49.406
Ooh! Let me get one of them over easy, JK!

11:49.500 --> 11:51.958
No way, she's our slave.

11:52.045 --> 11:54.503
And over easy's nasty.
All that egg slime.

11:54.589 --> 11:56.250
Bitch, egg snot the best part.

11:56.341 --> 11:58.332
-[scoffs] Splooge-y.
-[Black Cindy] Y'all crazy.

11:58.426 --> 12:00.337
Over easy's the only way to cook an egg.

12:00.428 --> 12:02.044
Ain't that right, Jude?

12:02.138 --> 12:04.675
Over medium is considered
the gold standard.

12:04.766 --> 12:07.007
-[laughing]
- In your face!

12:07.101 --> 12:10.639
Shocking. The white lady backs up
the other whites about egg whites.

12:10.730 --> 12:13.893
Look, we need to borrow
D-list Martha Stewart for a while.

12:13.983 --> 12:16.896
We need to show the media that
she ain't locked up in a closet

12:16.986 --> 12:19.648
with a bag over her head
and jumper cables on her nips.

12:19.739 --> 12:22.026
-[all] Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
- What the fuck?

12:22.116 --> 12:24.653
She's our property
and we're not in the lending business.

12:24.744 --> 12:25.734
That's Jews.

12:25.828 --> 12:29.537
Yeah, maybe you didn't hear her.
We taking the bitch, so excuse us.

12:29.624 --> 12:32.457
Oh, so this is communism now?
We give you whatever for free?

12:32.543 --> 12:35.752
No, our whole lives is
you people takin' from us for free.

12:35.838 --> 12:39.752
If you want her,
you gotta buy her, like an American.

12:39.842 --> 12:41.173
That's the deal.

12:44.472 --> 12:45.962
[sighs]

12:48.726 --> 12:49.966
What do you want for her?

12:50.687 --> 12:51.893
What VOu got?

12:51.980 --> 12:55.393
Aw, shit!
You seeing this?

12:55.483 --> 12:57.645
[young <i>Janae] Yes.
And I disagree.</i>

12:57.735 --> 13:01.649
I think Bods giving tree actually does
more takin' away than giving.

13:01.739 --> 13:04.356
- How so?
- The tree's a sign of goodness.

13:04.450 --> 13:05.736
But when it gets filled with cement,

13:05.827 --> 13:09.240
the tree symbolizes what's been taken
from Scout, her innocence.

13:09.330 --> 13:12.197
- Plus, she's got that dumb name.
-[students laugh]

13:12.292 --> 13:13.453
[school bell rings]

13:13.543 --> 13:15.375
Okay, permission slips, people!

13:15.461 --> 13:18.328
I need them
before we get on the bus tomorrow.

13:18.423 --> 13:20.539
Uh, Janae, I'd like to speak with you.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.840
Ooh. Watson getting called out.

13:22.927 --> 13:24.167
Yeah, right.
For what?

13:27.807 --> 13:30.094
- Here, I got my permission slip.
- Ah, excellent.

13:30.184 --> 13:33.017
I want to make sure
you're coming tomorrow. You excited?

13:33.104 --> 13:34.686
- Yeah. I guess.
- I'm excited for you.

13:35.398 --> 13:38.015
Doors are gonna open
if you keep working hard, Janae.

13:38.109 --> 13:39.816
I want you to see
what's behind some of those doors.

13:39.902 --> 13:42.735
Okay. Great.
See you tomorrow.

13:46.784 --> 13:48.775
Okay. So after flossing my teeth,

13:48.870 --> 13:51.532
and doing that under-eye cream
we talked about,

13:51.622 --> 13:55.115
I go to here, Spanish Harlem.

13:55.209 --> 13:57.041
I know it looks messy and everything,

13:57.128 --> 13:59.540
but it's because we have
that protest and everything.

13:59.630 --> 14:05.171
My bunk is over there, and right here,
we have Pidge and Ouija.

14:05.261 --> 14:07.548
Or Peejee.
Say hi, you guys!

14:07.638 --> 14:10.881
- No one calls us that.
- I didn't sign a release.

14:13.102 --> 14:16.345
Okay, so over here, we have Maria.

14:16.439 --> 14:20.774
I made this selfie stick
out of a plunger and duct tape.

14:20.860 --> 14:24.228
Look at the link below
if you want directions.

14:26.240 --> 14:29.858
And over here,
we have my best friend, Maritza.

14:29.952 --> 14:31.863
- Say <i>hi, chiquita.
- No! Go</i> away!

14:31.954 --> 14:33.661
I already took my face off
from this morning.

14:33.748 --> 14:36.206
- I gotta put a new one on.
- No. This is a day in the life.

14:36.292 --> 14:37.453
For the people.

14:37.543 --> 14:40.285
Tell them what you're doing.
Come on.

14:40.380 --> 14:43.543
[sighs] Okay, fine. [clears throat]

14:44.592 --> 14:46.549
Hi, everybody!

14:46.636 --> 14:50.049
Okay, so what I'm doing now
is contour and highlight.

14:50.139 --> 14:51.220
When I wasn't in prison,

14:51.307 --> 14:55.517
I would do this with a MAC Pro Palette
and a #19 fan brush.

14:55.603 --> 14:59.892
But in here, I use three spices
that you can find in any kitchen.

14:59.982 --> 15:02.394
- Okay.
- Cinnamon...

15:02.485 --> 15:04.067
cumin...

15:04.153 --> 15:05.735
and SazÃ©n Goya.

15:05.822 --> 15:09.281
Yes, your face will smell
like your abuela's pork.

15:09.367 --> 15:14.487
But listen, you gotta make sacrifices
if you wanna look DIY fly like me.

15:14.580 --> 15:16.070
[chuckles]

15:16.165 --> 15:18.702
First... contour.

15:23.506 --> 15:24.996
[groaning]

15:27.009 --> 15:28.295
[Angie groans]

15:31.681 --> 15:33.217
Where's the cheese?

15:34.684 --> 15:37.176
[retches and grunts]

15:38.354 --> 15:39.344
Fuck.

15:40.231 --> 15:42.939
[grunts] What cheese? [sighs]

15:43.025 --> 15:46.268
- I had cheese, didn't I?
-[retches]

15:46.362 --> 15:47.397
[groans]

15:47.488 --> 15:49.445
[chuckling] VVhQa!

15:49.532 --> 15:52.149
[laughing] Check it out.
Your puke is purple.

15:52.243 --> 15:54.826
Yeah, 'cause the cough syrup's red...

15:54.912 --> 15:57.449
[sniffs] and something was blue.

15:59.584 --> 16:00.665
[grunts]

16:03.880 --> 16:04.995
Hey!

16:08.050 --> 16:09.256
[softly] Someone stole the fucking gun.

16:11.554 --> 16:14.296
[chuckles] No, they didn't.
We hid it, remember?

16:15.224 --> 16:17.465
- We did?
- In the secret place!

16:18.936 --> 16:22.850
[gasps] Oh, yeah. The secret place
where no one else would ever find it.

16:30.990 --> 16:33.652
[Pidge] I'm from Hebei province in China,

16:33.743 --> 16:38.032
56 years old, 108 pounds, and--

16:38.122 --> 16:40.238
I'm annoying as fuck?
Who is Mei Chang?

16:40.917 --> 16:43.124
- Damn, Ouij!
- Stop pitching me softies. Come on.

16:44.086 --> 16:45.121
All right.

16:46.088 --> 16:47.078
All right.

16:47.798 --> 16:48.879
Okay-

16:50.009 --> 16:56.597
I'm from Omaha, Nebraska,
46 years old, 130 pounds,

16:56.682 --> 17:01.677
ashy-blonde hair
and I'm doing nine for media piracy.

17:01.771 --> 17:03.637
- Who is White Cindy?
- Seriously?

17:03.731 --> 17:06.393
Yo! My ass was just on the news!

17:06.483 --> 17:07.815
Yo, we're all on the news, dumb-ass.

17:07.902 --> 17:11.065
It's good 'cause people need to
start taking us serious--

17:11.155 --> 17:15.319
No, my actual ass.
See.

17:15.409 --> 17:17.570
-[Pidge] Yo.
-[chuckles]

17:18.746 --> 17:19.827
[Pidge] on...

17:19.914 --> 17:21.951
Really?
Way to keep it classy, perra.

17:22.040 --> 17:25.159
- That hoo-ha out, too? Shit.
-[Zirconia chuckles] I put it all out.

17:25.252 --> 17:26.914
[scattered chuckling]

17:29.048 --> 17:30.880
Um, can I help you with something?

17:30.967 --> 17:33.925
Where's Caputo? He's not in the pen
with the other little piggies.

17:34.011 --> 17:35.342
Nah, we put him in the Poo.
Why?

17:35.429 --> 17:37.796
I'm going to rip his balls off.

17:39.976 --> 17:41.091
[Zirconia] Oh, shit.

17:41.811 --> 17:42.846
[banging on window]

17:42.937 --> 17:46.305
Oh, this fucking guy again.
All morning, "I gotta go, I gotta go."

17:46.399 --> 17:47.560
Need to go to the bathroom!

17:47.650 --> 17:49.561
I think he gotta go big bathroom.

17:49.652 --> 17:52.861
[Maria] I think that
you need to shut the fuck up.

17:52.947 --> 17:55.780
We gave you a bucket.
Use the bucket.

17:55.866 --> 17:57.732
[Stratman] A bucket is not a toilet.

17:57.827 --> 18:00.694
Stratman, use the bucket.
You're gonna get us all killed.

18:00.788 --> 18:02.870
You don't understand.
[stutters] I can't.

18:02.957 --> 18:06.621
I mean, I can't
when there's other people around me.

18:06.711 --> 18:09.248
Since I was a kid.
I need total and utter privacy.

18:10.756 --> 18:13.498
- Please! Please let me out!
-[guards yelling]

18:14.427 --> 18:15.417
I don't know.

18:16.804 --> 18:18.841
God. Hey, does anyone here
know the brown note?

18:18.931 --> 18:20.171
[groans]

18:20.266 --> 18:21.722
Is that that jazz club in Harlem?

18:22.643 --> 18:23.758
What?

18:23.853 --> 18:25.343
No, it's the sound frequency

18:25.438 --> 18:27.850
that makes your bowls vibrate
and release automatically.

18:27.940 --> 18:30.773
- I saw it on <i>Brain</i> Buzzer.
- That's not a reputable source.

18:30.860 --> 18:31.895
Hey, Stratman...

18:32.903 --> 18:34.860
[humming low note]

18:37.867 --> 18:39.107
[grunts]

18:39.994 --> 18:42.486
[continues humming]

18:42.580 --> 18:44.116
[Stratman coughs]

18:44.206 --> 18:45.571
- Fuck. Nothing?
-[Blake] Keep going, keep going.

18:45.666 --> 18:48.533
-[humming continues]
-[Stratman] No, no, no. Oh, God.

18:50.796 --> 18:54.790
[grunts] Oh, stop, stop.
Stop. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.

18:54.884 --> 18:56.500
[cell phone ringing]

18:59.889 --> 19:01.755
Yeah?
Who's this?

19:01.849 --> 19:03.635
<i>[Gloria] Aleida?</i>

19:03.726 --> 19:05.137
Oh, my God, Gloria?

19:05.227 --> 19:07.969
<i>- What</i> the fuck number's <i>this?</i>
- I found a cell phone. [chuckles]

19:08.064 --> 19:09.646
<i>You found a cell phone
and you're calling me?</i>

19:09.732 --> 19:12.315
Damn, woman.
Ain't you got no real friends?

19:12.401 --> 19:14.984
We were only prison gay.
Minus the gay part.

19:15.071 --> 19:16.482
[chuckles]

19:16.572 --> 19:18.188
Yeah, what can I say?
I missed you.

19:18.824 --> 19:19.859
How's everything out there?

19:22.036 --> 19:25.245
I'm good.
Gettin' mad job offers.

19:26.207 --> 19:28.574
You know, different nail salons.

19:28.668 --> 19:32.127
After they seen my cheetah toes,
everybody been fightin' over me.

19:32.213 --> 19:34.671
- You see? I told you you'd kill it.
- Yeah.

19:35.925 --> 19:37.131
You called it.

19:38.469 --> 19:41.006
<i>How about you?
Same shit, same day?</i>

19:42.014 --> 19:44.927
Yeah.
Something like that. [chuckles]

19:45.810 --> 19:48.723
You all right, girl?
You sound funny.

19:50.064 --> 19:52.431
Listen, I gotta tell you something.

19:55.444 --> 19:58.357
<i>What?
What is it?</i>

20:00.116 --> 20:02.198
[sighs] Nothing.

20:04.286 --> 20:08.405
[sighs] I feel like I'm, you know,
losing my mind in here.

20:09.750 --> 20:11.206
My grip on things.

20:14.422 --> 20:15.753
You gotta do you, girl.

20:17.383 --> 20:20.296
<i>You seen that sign on the subway?
"See Something, Say Something"?</i>

20:20.386 --> 20:24.550
Do the opposite of that shit.
Say nothing, do nothing.

20:24.640 --> 20:26.802
Keep your chin down, do your fucking time,

20:26.892 --> 20:28.929
and don't take care
of nobody but yourself.

20:29.019 --> 20:30.134
[chuckles]

20:31.564 --> 20:33.271
Oh, thanks.
That's some good advice.

20:33.357 --> 20:35.519
<i>And Daya, of course.</i>

20:35.609 --> 20:38.727
Don't you be no self-centered bitch
when it comes to her.

20:38.821 --> 20:40.437
<i>She doin' all right?</i>

20:41.490 --> 20:42.821
Fine.
She's a good kid.

20:42.908 --> 20:45.616
<i>Well, tell her I'm busting my ass
out here, trying to get us set up,</i>

20:45.703 --> 20:49.196
so she better not be pullin' shit.
You tell her that from me.

20:49.290 --> 20:51.998
- Yeah, I'll tell her.
- All right.

20:53.085 --> 20:54.075
[cell phone beeps]

20:57.506 --> 20:58.746
[Pennsatucky grunts]

21:00.801 --> 21:01.916
Mmm. Don't touch.

21:02.011 --> 21:04.469
What, you don't like it when I...
when I brush your cheek like that?

21:04.555 --> 21:05.761
No, I like it just fine.

21:05.848 --> 21:08.761
You're just not supposed
to be doing anything that I don't say.

21:08.851 --> 21:10.467
- That's the rules.
- I'm sorry.

21:10.561 --> 21:12.268
- You gonna let me lead or not?
- Yes.

21:12.354 --> 21:13.890
- Okay.
- I'm sorry.

21:15.191 --> 21:16.352
[Pennsatucky moans]

21:20.696 --> 21:22.357
Keep telling me
what you want me to do. I...

21:23.365 --> 21:25.732
I wanna do to you
what the vibrating phone did.

21:26.535 --> 21:28.196
Seeing you get turned on, it was...

21:29.371 --> 21:32.159
- It was so hot. I wanna turn you on.
-[chuckles]

21:32.833 --> 21:35.040
- You do? Well, then do it.
- Uh-huh.

21:37.963 --> 21:40.000
[Big Boo] You have got to
fucking be kidding me, Doggett.

21:40.090 --> 21:41.876
- What?
- Get the fuck outside.

21:46.180 --> 21:48.763
Quick, hide.
You have to hide.

21:48.849 --> 21:50.965
- Where?
<i>- I'll</i> show you where.

21:51.060 --> 21:53.802
- You can hide in here. Get... get in.
- What?

21:53.896 --> 21:54.977
[Pennsatucky] Trust me, I've seen it done.

21:55.064 --> 21:56.680
-[Coates] Seriously?
- People fit. Just get in.

21:56.774 --> 21:58.765
Get the fuck in there.

21:58.859 --> 22:00.896
Don't close it all the way. Shhh!

22:02.530 --> 22:04.567
-[inmates clamoring in the distance]
- Hey.

22:04.657 --> 22:07.149
Let me give you a little preview
of how this thing's gonna end.

22:07.243 --> 22:09.450
See, any minute now,
your boyfriend will be captured,

22:09.537 --> 22:12.199
taken to the bubble, where he will be
forced to shit in a bucket.

22:12.289 --> 22:14.781
And you'll be lucky if you're not tossed
in there right behind him.

22:14.875 --> 22:17.913
Is that what you want? Really?
To hold hands over a shit bucket?

22:20.005 --> 22:20.995
I don't know.

22:22.091 --> 22:23.547
What could you possibly not know?

22:23.634 --> 22:26.877
I don't know...
because it's chemical, Boo.

22:26.971 --> 22:29.759
Okay? It's like when
I used to cook meth, okay?

22:29.849 --> 22:31.760
I can't control the chemicals.

22:31.851 --> 22:33.808
I had to respect the chemicals.

22:33.894 --> 22:37.353
No matter how much I wanted different,
I had to respect the chemicals.

22:38.357 --> 22:41.600
Because lye doesn't feel anything
until it touches ephedrine.

22:41.694 --> 22:43.059
You know what I mean?

22:45.406 --> 22:46.396
[sighs]

22:47.491 --> 22:51.655
Have you ever...
wanted somebody that you shouldn't?

22:53.038 --> 22:54.995
Of course.

22:55.082 --> 22:56.368
It's called masturbating.

22:56.458 --> 23:00.122
Now, say goodbye
and walk the fuck away, son.

23:01.881 --> 23:04.794
God. God damn it.

23:07.511 --> 23:09.843
Now the EstÃ©e Lauder
makeup bag is our final offer

23:09.930 --> 23:14.470
and if you act now we'll throw in,
uh, lightly used lnvisalign braces.

23:14.560 --> 23:16.972
-[scoffs]
- Oh, wait. For what size mouth?

23:17.062 --> 23:18.848
Mmm. They might work for you, gappy.

23:18.939 --> 23:20.350
Hey, my gap is awesome.

23:20.441 --> 23:22.523
I just wanna fix my left pointy tooth
'cause it's a little twisty.

23:22.610 --> 23:26.604
No! We didn't get
into the slave business for braces.

23:26.697 --> 23:28.904
We want land. Turf.

23:28.991 --> 23:31.904
The Latinas got a dorm.
Blacks are all over the offices.

23:31.994 --> 23:34.531
- What do the white people have? Nothing.
- Everything.

23:34.622 --> 23:37.330
Territory is off-limits.

23:38.667 --> 23:39.748
Then you ain't gettin' King.

23:41.170 --> 23:45.755
And... we're taking our stock public.

23:45.841 --> 23:47.752
- Who wants to buy Judy King?
-[inmates clamoring]

23:47.843 --> 23:49.754
- Selling to the highest bidder.
- I do.

23:49.845 --> 23:51.461
[clamoring continues]

23:51.555 --> 23:54.798
Damn, JK!
Lotta people hate you.

23:56.143 --> 23:58.225
Or want you,
depending how you wanna look at it.

23:58.312 --> 24:01.805
All right, folks, we got
a fine-lookin' piece of chattel up here.

24:01.899 --> 24:03.856
A fine-looking piece of chattel.

24:03.943 --> 24:05.604
Cooking skills.
Strong backside.

24:05.694 --> 24:09.813
Go on, girl, show 'em your teeth.
Lotta gold in there, folks. Lotta gold.

24:09.907 --> 24:13.320
- How do you know how to auctioneer?
- Ain't it genetic for her type?

24:13.452 --> 24:16.114
I've got an EstÃ©e Lauder
makeup bag high bidder, EstÃ©e Lauder high.

24:16.205 --> 24:18.196
- Do I hear higher?
- Uh, does she cuddle?

24:18.290 --> 24:19.872
Does she know how to dress wounds?

24:19.959 --> 24:21.791
- I've got a phone charger!
-[Judy] That is my charger!

24:21.877 --> 24:22.912
Stifle it, meat!

24:23.003 --> 24:25.870
I've got a phone charger money bidder,
folks, phone charger money bidder.

24:25.965 --> 24:28.753
And... and five ramen noodle packets!

24:28.842 --> 24:30.879
-[Brandy] Charger and five, do I hear ten?
-[inaudible]

24:30.970 --> 24:32.927
Would ya give ten? Would ya bid ten?
Do ya give ten?

24:33.013 --> 24:34.253
Ten cans of tuna!

24:34.348 --> 24:37.557
Ten tuna can money.
Ten tuna money. Do I hear 15?

24:37.643 --> 24:41.932
Uh, 15 AA batteries. That's AA,
which is radio and vibrator size.

24:42.022 --> 24:43.512
- I got 20 bottles of beer.
-[Brandy] Excellent!

24:43.607 --> 24:45.518
Twenty bottles of beer high bidder.
Twenty bottles of beer--

<i>[all] âª Take one down, pass it around... âª</i>

24:52.241 --> 24:55.324
Okay! I got one boom box
from Caputo's office.

24:55.411 --> 24:59.370
Plug in it and everything.
And I'll add some white boy CDs.

24:59.456 --> 25:01.447
[Janae] Man,
what we need this white lady for?

25:01.542 --> 25:04.876
We wanna go to the press?
We should do it ourselves.

25:04.962 --> 25:07.545
Look, you've seen the news.
They think we're torturing hostages.

25:07.631 --> 25:10.419
How are we supposed to
get our demands met, and justice for P,

25:10.509 --> 25:11.965
if they think we a bunch of animals?

25:12.052 --> 25:14.669
No, they're gonna think
that we're animals no matter what.

25:14.763 --> 25:15.969
Don't you know that?

25:16.056 --> 25:19.594
Yo. I got an autographed copy
of <i>Rich</i> Dad Poor Dad.

25:19.685 --> 25:21.346
A Debbie Gibson
<i>Electric</i> Youth cassette tape.

25:21.437 --> 25:22.518
[inmate] Potato chips!

25:22.604 --> 25:25.016
Lisa Frank rainbow unicorn stickers.

25:25.107 --> 25:29.476
I got an Anne Geddes
babies calendar from 2007. Huh?

25:29.570 --> 25:31.436
[Suzanne] Ooh!

25:31.530 --> 25:33.316
And sold, to the big black one,

25:33.407 --> 25:35.648
for the Anne Geddes
baby calendar and the other stuff!

25:35.743 --> 25:38.201
What? Why do we need
a calendar full of fat babies

25:38.287 --> 25:40.699
posing with pumpkins and fruit and shit?

25:40.789 --> 25:42.279
Unicorn stickers.

25:42.374 --> 25:44.456
It's art.
Art is always a sound investment.

25:44.543 --> 25:48.411
[sighs] Come on, JK.
You ours now.

25:48.505 --> 25:49.791
Oh, thank you, Cindy.

25:49.882 --> 25:53.170
Oh, I guess it just shows you should
stay friends with your exes, right?

25:53.260 --> 25:55.001
Do you mind taking this collar
off me right now?

25:55.095 --> 25:59.339
Bitch, please! The past is the past,
and I ain't Oskar Schindler.

25:59.433 --> 26:00.423
Now get down!

26:01.435 --> 26:03.176
[clicks tongue] Heel!

26:03.270 --> 26:04.635
[Black Cindy chuckles]

26:09.693 --> 26:12.776
- Shit, we at the White House?
- Sure ain't no Black House.

26:14.656 --> 26:16.488
Uh, Janae!
Over here.

26:20.079 --> 26:23.071
This is Courtney, your buddy for the day.
Courtney, Janae.

26:23.165 --> 26:25.076
We are so glad to have you here.

26:25.167 --> 26:27.033
Come on!
I'll give you the tour.

26:31.715 --> 26:33.706
Is this your first time in Riverdale?

26:33.801 --> 26:36.418
I mean, it's not like
I've ever been to the South Bronx.

26:36.512 --> 26:39.345
Although, my dad did once take me
to Arthur Avenue

26:39.431 --> 26:42.014
to buy some
crazy Italian espresso machine.

26:42.101 --> 26:44.388
He's got this, like,
whole coffee thing going on.

26:44.478 --> 26:49.143
This is the south lawn, by the way.
Out here we do botany and painting.

26:49.233 --> 26:51.440
And the garden, obviously.

26:51.527 --> 26:54.019
We harvested a whole bunch of stuff
on Community Day

26:54.113 --> 26:56.229
and made this giant salad for the PTO.

26:57.324 --> 26:59.065
This is Rocawear, right? [chuckles]

26:59.159 --> 27:02.652
I love it. I have the same exact one
at home. Come on.

27:02.746 --> 27:05.909
Running hurts my boobs,
but it burns so many calories.

27:05.999 --> 27:07.865
Maybe I just need a better bra.

27:07.960 --> 27:12.204
We're doing Faulkner. As <i>I</i> Lay Dying.
Isn't it so aptly named?

27:13.465 --> 27:18.426
[sighs] Oh, so, this is the reading room.
We do SAT prep in here and other stuff.

27:23.016 --> 27:24.381
<i>[news anchor] ...in the courts.</i>

27:24.476 --> 27:27.810
<i>There's the question of how many
correctional officers, staff members...</i>

27:27.896 --> 27:31.059
Sorry. The fucking 6 train wasn't running
between fuck and east fuck,

27:31.150 --> 27:33.141
so I had to walk up 163rd Street,

27:33.235 --> 27:35.351
where I saw not one, not two,
but three dicks.

27:35.445 --> 27:37.903
One peeing, one masturbating
and one homeless.

27:37.990 --> 27:39.355
Aleida, you seen this?

27:40.617 --> 27:41.732
It's all over the news.

27:41.827 --> 27:44.239
<i>You have to keep in mind,
a lot of these women are mentally ill,</i>

27:44.329 --> 27:47.412
<i>sent to prisons because so many of
the state facilities have been shut down.</i>

27:47.499 --> 27:49.456
<i>- They talkin' 'bout Litchfield?

27:49.543 --> 27:51.830
<i>on the breaking news story

27:51.920 --> 27:54.457
<i>where a violent uprising
broke out late last night.</i>

27:54.548 --> 27:59.918
Nah. I just spoke to my girl in there.
She didn't say shit about this.

28:00.012 --> 28:02.424
Maybe the riot hadn't started yet?

28:02.514 --> 28:05.176
Ain't you listening?
It started yesterday.

28:05.267 --> 28:08.851
She was lying
through her fucking teeth. [grunts]

28:08.937 --> 28:10.894
[voicemail message in Mandarin plays]

28:12.191 --> 28:13.272
Fuck!

28:14.610 --> 28:15.771
Where is she?

28:16.945 --> 28:20.188
<i>[news anchor] ...often affiliated
with gangs and prone to violence.</i>

28:20.282 --> 28:24.196
<i>They have no intention
of rejoining polite society.</i>

28:24.286 --> 28:28.245
I feel like I'm seeing you naked...
but it's your face.

28:28.332 --> 28:31.165
If and when we storm
and there's hand-to-hand combat,

28:31.251 --> 28:36.087
I didn't want any of them
to have anything to grab on to.

28:36.173 --> 28:38.130
Still, extreme. [chuckles]

28:38.217 --> 28:39.548
- It was a safety issue.
-[siren blares]

28:40.302 --> 28:41.292
[horn honks]

28:42.012 --> 28:43.002
Finally.

28:43.096 --> 28:45.508
We can send these jokers back to Max
and get the job done.

28:47.434 --> 28:49.300
[indistinct chatter]

28:51.939 --> 28:53.475
- You Piscatella?
- I am, sir, yes.

28:53.565 --> 28:54.726
- How can I--
- Well, you can start

28:54.816 --> 28:56.853
by finding the owner
of this purple PT Cruiser

28:56.944 --> 28:59.106
and telling her to move her car.
We need this whole area clear.

28:59.196 --> 29:02.484
Cavalo, Reed, let's get the schematics
and assign positions.

29:02.574 --> 29:03.905
And when we get the cars out of here,

29:03.992 --> 29:06.324
we got a shit-ton of press
and civilians to contain.

29:06.411 --> 29:07.901
- I have schematics for you, sir.
-[officer] Yes, sir!

29:07.996 --> 29:10.579
And what I was thinking is, we'd... we...

29:11.833 --> 29:15.042
Need help, Desi?
Finding the owner of the vag car?

29:20.342 --> 29:21.503
<i>VoilÃ .</i>

29:21.593 --> 29:23.049
Your reading nook.

29:25.305 --> 29:27.171
Oh.

29:27.266 --> 29:29.382
- Huh.
- What's "Oh, huh" about it?

29:29.476 --> 29:30.966
Well, I thought we talked
about the reading nook

29:31.061 --> 29:34.179
being a bit more about reading
and less about... clutter.

29:34.273 --> 29:36.059
I like having things around, Piper.

29:36.149 --> 29:38.356
It comforts me.
I'm a collector.

29:38.443 --> 29:41.401
Why don't you go over there
and sit on your dirty yoga mat

29:41.488 --> 29:45.322
and admire your... collections.

29:45.409 --> 29:47.571
Do you not want me to be comfortable
in our dirt home?

29:47.661 --> 29:51.700
I'm simply asking you
if these items spark joy.

29:52.874 --> 29:55.457
<i>According to
The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up,</i>

29:55.544 --> 29:59.663
you should only have items
in your home that... spark joy.

29:59.756 --> 30:01.838
- You know what would bring me joy?
- Hmm?

30:01.925 --> 30:05.964
- Smacking you.
- Open hand only and just on my butt.

30:06.054 --> 30:08.671
Larry got off target once,
and I did not enjoy it.

30:08.765 --> 30:10.551
- So, hard limit.
- Funny.

30:13.770 --> 30:14.760
Fuck!

30:14.855 --> 30:17.563
What are all these people doing here?

30:17.649 --> 30:19.890
Maybe they like sleeping alfresco, too.

30:22.654 --> 30:24.190
Maybe they're playing follow the leader.

30:24.281 --> 30:25.521
Shut up.

30:44.092 --> 30:47.084
Caputo, you son of a bitch!

30:47.179 --> 30:49.466
How do you sleep at night,
knowing that that m0ther--

30:49.556 --> 30:50.887
[Chang] Wrong toilet.

30:50.974 --> 30:53.261
- Oh, sorry. Caputo.
- Leave me alone!

30:53.352 --> 30:56.936
-[Red] Caputo!
-[sighs] Red, over here.

30:58.148 --> 31:00.139
{pounding on door]
- Hey!

31:02.444 --> 31:07.314
You knew what Piscatella was
and you let that beast work here?

31:07.407 --> 31:08.989
In a women's prison?

31:09.076 --> 31:11.408
[Caputo] Hey. Hey!

31:11.495 --> 31:14.908
No kicking!
I am very close to an overflow issue here!

31:14.998 --> 31:19.083
[Red] He murdered an inmate!
And I know you know.

31:19.169 --> 31:21.285
-[speaks Russian]
-[in English] Red, please.

31:21.380 --> 31:24.418
You have no idea how hot it is in here.

31:24.508 --> 31:27.921
And the smell.
I can barely breathe.

31:28.011 --> 31:30.218
[Red] Oh, is it hot?
Is it so hot? Oh!

31:30.305 --> 31:33.468
But at least
you're not being boiled alive!

31:33.558 --> 31:35.925
You don't think I've been trying
to get rid of this guy, too?

31:36.019 --> 31:39.557
I've been fishing around that same file.
That's why it was in my office.

31:39.648 --> 31:41.855
But there was no charges
pressed against him.

31:41.942 --> 31:44.479
It went through arbitration.
It was...

31:44.569 --> 31:46.059
[sighs]

31:46.154 --> 31:48.236
A guard's word against a dead inmate's.

31:48.323 --> 31:51.065
But where there is guilt,
there's recourse.

31:51.159 --> 31:54.743
There's always pins
that can be pushed under fingernails.

31:54.830 --> 31:58.824
How do you plan on getting to his fingers
when you're in here, in a riot,

31:58.917 --> 32:01.579
and he's out there,
with no charges against him?

32:01.670 --> 32:03.252
Maybe, if you wish hard enough,

32:03.338 --> 32:08.458
he'll suddenly decide to sit down
and write a confession called "I did it."

32:10.011 --> 32:12.969
[softly] Yes... that's good.

32:13.974 --> 32:15.965
- But that's good...
- No, that's not good.

32:16.059 --> 32:19.723
Red, let's make a deal.
If you help me out of this,

32:19.813 --> 32:23.226
I will write you a glowing commendation
for your file.

32:23.316 --> 32:26.604
You helped a warden in a time of crisis.

Hey, Ruiz!
Please!

32:38.415 --> 32:41.077
- He's hyperventilating.
-[Luschek] He's not hyperventilating.

32:41.168 --> 32:43.535
He can't breathe
and he's humming Sound of <i>Music</i> songs.

32:43.628 --> 32:46.086
-[Stratman humming]
- Maybe that's normal for him.

32:46.173 --> 32:48.540
- Part of his process.
- Stratman?

- It's Donuts.

Oh, come on.
I've eaten rabbits bigger than him.

33:45.148 --> 33:46.684
For real.
There was this weird chemical

33:46.775 --> 33:48.516
in the runoff water
that ran near our farm.

33:48.610 --> 33:50.942
My guinea pig got too big to pick up.

- Let's dunk this donut.
- One, two, three.

34:05.377 --> 34:08.039
You're our hostage now,
you squirmy little donut fucker.

34:08.129 --> 34:10.370
Donut fucker!

34:10.465 --> 34:12.331
- I could totally see him doing that.
-[chuckles]

34:12.425 --> 34:13.835
Hey, Penn, look!
We're capturers!

34:13.927 --> 34:17.511
[chuckling] I see that.
Wow! Good work.

34:17.597 --> 34:19.257
Why are you guys down here?

34:19.349 --> 34:23.467
Well, we were looking for the gun,
but instead, we found a giant rabbit pig.

34:23.562 --> 34:25.599
[Leanne and Angie chuckling]

34:25.688 --> 34:27.179
[Leanne] Prison heroes, two days in a row.

34:27.274 --> 34:29.060
Come on, help us take him to the bubble.

34:29.150 --> 34:32.859
Okay. Ooh, I have a better idea.
Let's lock him in Poo instead.

34:32.946 --> 34:35.062
And show him how
he's really done people wrong.

34:35.156 --> 34:38.399
But then, no one would see
our victory parade to the bubble.

34:38.493 --> 34:40.860
Damn, I wish we had the gun for that.

34:40.954 --> 34:42.536
Show 'em our colors don't run.

34:42.621 --> 34:43.578
You know, I have a really good idea.

34:43.665 --> 34:46.657
Why don't you two stay here
and look for the gun,

34:46.751 --> 34:49.583
-and I'll fucking take care of him?
- No way!

34:49.670 --> 34:51.786
You wanna steal our thunder!
Thunder thief.

34:51.880 --> 34:54.213
- Come on. Bubble.
-[Leanne] Let's go. [grunts]

34:54.301 --> 34:58.169
No, wait. No, you guys, I don't want
to steal your thunder or your lightning.

34:58.263 --> 35:01.255
[stutters] I just wanna see justice.

35:02.892 --> 35:06.601
All right, I'll...
I'll cover you guys from behind, then.

35:06.688 --> 35:08.144
What do you mean "which guy"?

35:08.231 --> 35:11.474
The fucking guy you got on your channel
right now talking bullshit

35:11.568 --> 35:13.855
<i>about "the gang politics of riots."</i>

35:13.945 --> 35:15.652
<i>- Talking out his ass.
-[sighs] Uh-huh.</i>

35:15.739 --> 35:19.528
Yeah, saying that all the inmates
at Litchfield are dangerous?

35:19.618 --> 35:21.234
That they don't want to be rehabilitated?

35:21.328 --> 35:24.116
<i>Everyone I know in there
wants to be rehabilitated.</i>

35:24.205 --> 35:26.287
<i>- Okay. [sighs]
- You're supposed to be</i> a <i>producer?</i>

35:26.374 --> 35:29.992
'Cause I'm giving you pro tips here.
I just got out that dump.

35:31.046 --> 35:32.787
Wait, you were an inmate?
At--

35:32.881 --> 35:37.000
Litchfield! Yes.
That's what I been trying to say, pendeja.

35:37.093 --> 35:38.254
My daughter's still in there.

35:38.345 --> 35:41.633
To confirm,
you were in prison with Judy King?

35:41.723 --> 35:43.885
Judy King was in prison with me.

35:45.352 --> 35:47.810
Miss Diaz, can we send a town car for you?

35:47.896 --> 35:49.637
You're willing to go on air
with us, right?

35:52.400 --> 35:53.515
Yeah.

35:53.610 --> 35:55.192
[Black Cindy humming]

35:59.199 --> 36:00.940
[Judy hissing]

36:02.202 --> 36:03.988
- Ouch!
-[sighs]

36:04.079 --> 36:07.322
[grunts] I said square shape.

36:07.415 --> 36:11.374
Only Rihanna can rock the round toes.
Don't forget it.

36:12.504 --> 36:14.791
It's like sawing through an elm.

36:14.881 --> 36:16.417
What was that?

36:16.508 --> 36:21.218
Uh, I said I love working on your feet,
Bitch Goddess of Litch.

36:22.013 --> 36:24.050
That's what I thought you said.

36:25.350 --> 36:29.389
[sighs] Don't worry.
I'll free ya someday, Jude.

36:29.479 --> 36:32.938
Just as soon as
you work off your debts, hmm?

36:33.942 --> 36:38.561
Though... you never did pay me for them
Us <i>Weekly</i> photos, now did you?

36:38.655 --> 36:42.068
- Oh, no. [groans]
-[stutters] Mmm-mmm.

36:42.158 --> 36:44.024
So, it's gonna be a while.

36:45.745 --> 36:50.034
All right, spa time is over.
Judy need to do her consult with PR.

36:50.125 --> 36:51.206
Oh, hell no!

36:51.292 --> 36:54.205
We ain't even done
my asshole hair trimming yet!

36:54.295 --> 36:57.287
Look, I got to spread my cheeks
and she gotta get up in there.

36:57.382 --> 37:00.340
Okay. Well, your wild booty hair gonna
have to wait.

37:00.427 --> 37:03.920
'Cause Judy need to talk to the press
'fore things swell up out there

37:04.013 --> 37:06.254
and he gonna massage her talking points.

37:06.349 --> 37:07.839
Yes, he is.

37:07.934 --> 37:11.723
[Judy] Now, wait. You expect me
to go speak with the public?

37:11.813 --> 37:15.101
I thought you meant that I could write
a statement through my people.

37:15.191 --> 37:18.934
I can't go out there like this!
No. I mean, you can't be serious.

37:19.028 --> 37:20.518
Watson, are we serious?

37:25.493 --> 37:27.905
- What's your name, son?
- Josh.

37:27.996 --> 37:30.237
- Uh, big fan, Miss King. It's an honor.
-[Taystee sighs]

37:30.331 --> 37:32.288
Thanks, darling.
Thanks for watching.

37:32.375 --> 37:34.332
- Now, what's the take?
- We got three talking points for you.

37:34.419 --> 37:36.376
- You just gonna wanna stick to the points.
- Okay.

37:36.463 --> 37:39.421
"I am not a hostage.
I am a participant.

37:39.507 --> 37:42.124
I want justice for Poussey.

37:42.218 --> 37:44.255
I want our demands met."

37:44.345 --> 37:45.380
- That's right.
-[Judy] All right.

37:45.472 --> 37:48.134
Now, do you want me to be off-book,
or should I go out with this?

37:48.224 --> 37:49.259
[Josh] Oh, you can have it with you.

37:49.350 --> 37:51.591
And we all think that
you should get back in uniform.

37:51.686 --> 37:52.972
- So you look more united.
- Yeah.

37:53.062 --> 37:56.430
And so, what do I say when they ask me,
"Why were you on the roof with idiots?"

37:56.524 --> 37:58.765
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't answer any questions.

37:58.860 --> 38:01.522
Anything they ask, you say,
"That's a great question.

38:01.613 --> 38:06.323
But the bigger question is,
what is going on in this prison system?"

38:06.409 --> 38:08.616
- Oh, he is good.
-[Black Cindy] Mmm.

38:08.703 --> 38:12.617
Oh, and I personally think it might
be helpful if you shared some sort of, um,

38:12.707 --> 38:14.823
relatable tribulations
from your time in here.

38:14.918 --> 38:18.536
Some painful experiences,
uh, injustices...

38:21.341 --> 38:22.297
Uh...

38:23.218 --> 38:24.379
Um...

38:26.679 --> 38:28.841
- We could also lie.
-[stutters] I am game to lie.

38:28.932 --> 38:32.175
All right, so now, ladies,
what would you like me to say?

38:32.268 --> 38:34.134
[sighs] We get thrown
into the SHU arbitrarily.

38:34.229 --> 38:37.472
We're denied proper health care, dental.

38:37.565 --> 38:38.896
I saw a girl with a tooth gone septic,

38:38.983 --> 38:41.270
and they still didn't take her
to the doctor.

38:41.361 --> 38:42.977
We get beat for no reason.

38:43.071 --> 38:45.984
We get cavity searched for no reason.

38:46.074 --> 38:49.487
We stuffed four in a bunk
like we factory chickens.

38:49.577 --> 38:53.241
We can't get clean half the time
'cause there ain't enough bathrooms.

38:53.331 --> 38:54.571
We fed slop.

38:54.666 --> 38:58.000
We don't get paid for our labor.
We denied education.

38:58.086 --> 39:01.078
We're denied the chance
to breastfeed our babies.

39:01.172 --> 39:03.584
We're denied basic humanity.

39:04.717 --> 39:07.835
And we get killed in the cafeteria
for no reason.

39:11.015 --> 39:13.177
- You got a pen?
- Yeah.

39:21.442 --> 39:23.149
You can't let
this white woman speak for us.

39:23.236 --> 39:24.943
She needs to take our stories
out her mouth.

39:25.071 --> 39:29.030
Come on, man. I know you saw them people
out there with them Judy King signs.

39:29.117 --> 39:30.949
They want to hear from her.

39:31.035 --> 39:33.993
And it would be smart of us
if we put her out there.

39:34.080 --> 39:37.823
They'll hear more of what we saying
if it comes from her mouth.

39:37.917 --> 39:41.160
Yeah, but she's never been
a real prisoner a day in her life.

39:41.254 --> 39:43.621
She ain't in mourning.
She ain't outraged.

39:43.715 --> 39:45.046
[Josh speaking indistinctly]

39:45.133 --> 39:47.249
This is our fight, T.

39:47.343 --> 39:49.334
Ours and Poussey's.

39:49.429 --> 39:53.343
And you're gonna let some fuckin'
white woman, like, karaoke our song.

39:53.433 --> 39:55.219
That's fucked. [grunts]

39:55.310 --> 39:56.516
I got this.

39:57.812 --> 39:59.394
<i>[young Janae] We get to keep the laptops?</i>

39:59.480 --> 40:02.563
No, we keep them during the year
and then we return them

40:02.650 --> 40:05.608
so that they can update
or replace them over the summer.

40:05.695 --> 40:07.277
Oh, so what did you think of class?

40:07.363 --> 40:10.355
I'm sorry we spent so much time
on citations.

40:10.450 --> 40:14.569
Erik thinks we need to know
MLA, APA and Chicago Manual.

40:14.662 --> 40:16.198
Yeah.

40:16.915 --> 40:18.280
One of these is my brother's. [chuckles]

40:18.374 --> 40:20.490
For chess.
He's a total nerd.

40:20.585 --> 40:22.326
He's at Carnegie Mellon now.

40:24.339 --> 40:27.047
Oh, my God!
Do you like musical theater?

40:27.133 --> 40:29.420
Because I have something amazing
to show you.

40:29.510 --> 40:33.219
<i>[woman] âª All you've gotta do is dream âª

40:33.306 --> 40:35.343

40:38.603 --> 40:40.594

- Yeah.

My parents saw the original production
on Broadway.

Okay. Effie.

40:55.161 --> 40:57.323
Let's go to your solo, second bridge.

40:58.206 --> 41:00.618
You need to give this
a lot more soul here, honey.

41:00.708 --> 41:04.451
Channel your inner Aretha
and let those "No's" rip.

All these comments are about you, though.

42:51.611 --> 42:53.318
No, they're not.
Go back.

"Flaca looks like a beaner Cher."

43:15.093 --> 43:16.208
Come on!

43:16.302 --> 43:19.511
Cher's awesome.
And you do like beans.

43:19.597 --> 43:22.009
Who gives a shit
what some Internet troll says?

43:22.100 --> 43:24.182
It's stupid.
I'm gonna put it on airplane mode.

"Hashtag, show your tits, Maritz."

43:52.171 --> 43:53.502
I have sensitive cochlea!

That's right.
What'd you call me, huh? Huh?

44:08.062 --> 44:11.805
You call me what?
Go, go. Now, come on.

44:11.899 --> 44:14.106
[panting] Oh, thank God.

44:14.193 --> 44:16.855

44:47.810 --> 44:49.596
- Please.
- No can do.

44:49.687 --> 44:52.270
[Caputo] You know there will be
severe consequences for this.

44:52.356 --> 44:55.519
You know that, Ruiz?
Riots end, and inmates go to Max

44:55.610 --> 44:57.271
with years added to their sentence.

44:58.154 --> 45:00.737
If you help me, I will help you.

45:02.074 --> 45:05.066
That's what everyone
that's ever fucked me over has said.

45:05.161 --> 45:06.993
[Caputo] What about your kid, Ruiz?

45:07.079 --> 45:08.285
Think about her.

45:09.290 --> 45:13.909
If you help me, I can make sure
your sentence doesn't get extended.

45:14.003 --> 45:15.493
Hey, no kicking!

45:15.588 --> 45:17.750
Piscatella already put five more years
on my sentence

45:17.840 --> 45:19.422
for no fucking reason, all right?

45:19.508 --> 45:22.045
My daughter won't even know my name
by the time I get out anyway.

45:22.136 --> 45:23.968
Ruiz, are you sure he put time on you?

45:24.055 --> 45:26.046
'Course I'm sure!

45:26.140 --> 45:28.552
[Caputo] You... you had a hearing already?

45:28.643 --> 45:31.556
-[sighs] No.
-[Caputo] Then it's not a done deal.

45:31.646 --> 45:34.058
And with the speed
paperwork moves around Litchfield,

45:34.148 --> 45:35.388
I wouldn't be surprised

45:35.483 --> 45:38.350
if his recommendation
is not even in your file yet.

45:39.111 --> 45:40.476
Have you seen your file?

45:42.406 --> 45:46.195
Piscatella, he's a... monster.

45:46.285 --> 45:50.529
He should never have been working here
in the first place, and that's my fault.

45:50.623 --> 45:56.915
But you do not have to become the monster
he's making you out to be.

45:57.004 --> 46:00.122
I've seen you with the other inmates.

46:01.509 --> 46:02.999
They look up to you.

46:04.011 --> 46:06.548
Huh? Ruiz?

46:07.473 --> 46:08.713
[Stratman farts and groans]

46:10.768 --> 46:12.725
-[Stratman grunts]
- Stratman?

46:12.812 --> 46:14.268
[panting]

46:15.189 --> 46:16.771
[sighing]

46:17.858 --> 46:18.848
Oh, fuck.

46:19.944 --> 46:21.776
[indistinct chatter]

46:33.374 --> 46:36.583
Okay, enough.
You have to tell me what's going on.

46:36.669 --> 46:38.455
What?

46:38.546 --> 46:42.710
Why there is an army of lemmings
dressed like you, moving out here.

46:45.428 --> 46:48.591
- You sound insane.
- I am not insane!

46:48.681 --> 46:50.843
You're gaslighting me right now.

46:50.933 --> 46:52.298
- And technically...
-[Alex sighs]

46:52.393 --> 46:53.599
...do you know that's emotional abuse?

46:53.686 --> 46:55.768
Do you know
how I know that's emotional abuse?

46:55.896 --> 47:00.106
I read it in an online quiz once,
called "Are You Being Emotionally Abused?"

47:04.655 --> 47:06.487
Okay, I may have shared some...

47:07.408 --> 47:11.276
some things in my history
with a few inmates and it resonated.

47:11.370 --> 47:14.579
- They think I stand for something.
- What things from your history?

47:15.541 --> 47:16.997
That I killed Aydin.

47:18.085 --> 47:19.541
You told them that you killed Aydin?

47:19.628 --> 47:22.165
I didn't say Aydin specifically.

47:23.215 --> 47:25.252
I just shared my...

47:25.343 --> 47:27.835
I don't know, status as a...
as a murderess.

47:27.928 --> 47:29.293
I don't know, it just came out.

47:29.388 --> 47:30.924
We were supposed to take that
to the grave.

47:31.015 --> 47:33.052
I went to Von Barlow and I begged her

47:33.142 --> 47:35.304
-to keep it a secret--
- I didn't ask you to do that.

47:35.394 --> 47:36.976
So, what?
Do you not want a future with me?

47:37.063 --> 47:38.269
Do you not want a real house?

47:38.356 --> 47:41.849
It's not a real house if I can't carry
my truth inside it, Piper.

47:41.942 --> 47:43.478
And now you sound
like a fucking E.E. Cummings poem.

47:43.569 --> 47:44.730
I'm not sorry.

47:44.820 --> 47:48.688
Yeah, it sucks that they turned it into
some symbol of the resistance or whatever,

47:48.783 --> 47:51.445
but I am glad I said it out loud.

47:51.535 --> 47:54.323
Now, I want to lay down
in my tchotchke nook

47:54.413 --> 47:57.781
and I wanna relax
until this whole thing blows over.

47:58.834 --> 48:01.121
They heard what they wanted to.

48:02.004 --> 48:04.041
They turned it
into some kind of a symbol.

48:05.299 --> 48:09.964
What you do and what you say
affects people, Alex.

48:10.888 --> 48:12.720
-[sighs]
- It affects me.

48:14.683 --> 48:19.393
And if you do not curate your shit,
you are not a collector.

48:19.480 --> 48:21.767
- You're a hoarder.
- Okay, great.

48:21.857 --> 48:24.064
Very mature. Where're you...
Where are you going?

48:24.151 --> 48:25.687
I am going to the guest room.

48:25.778 --> 48:26.813
Oh.

48:28.739 --> 48:32.232
I'm from Fresno, California,
46 years old, Puerto Rican,

48:32.326 --> 48:34.408
-doing 11 years for armed robbery--
- Who's Rosalita Pontz?

48:34.495 --> 48:36.361
[inmates murmuring]

48:37.206 --> 48:41.120
I'm from North Philly,
5'9", 285 pounds.

48:41.210 --> 48:42.917
I got no identifying marks, and--

48:43.003 --> 48:44.869
Who's Jodi Winkler?

48:44.964 --> 48:46.170
[inmate] What?

48:46.257 --> 48:47.668
She's like Rain Man.

48:48.717 --> 48:50.549
Yo, you idiots got my file?

48:53.305 --> 48:54.670
Who's Maria Ruiz?

48:58.477 --> 48:59.638
[sighs]

49:02.398 --> 49:05.607
[Pidge] I'm from Kingston, New York.
5'4", 180 pounds.

49:05.693 --> 49:07.229
I got a rose tattoo.

49:07.319 --> 49:09.401
-[continues indistinctly]
-[Ouija] Jessie...

49:09.488 --> 49:11.104
-[Pidge grunts]
-[inmate] Whoo!

49:12.825 --> 49:16.284
"This prison has put me through
unimaginable suffering,

49:16.370 --> 49:18.281
and I am not a victim of this riot.

49:18.372 --> 49:20.830
I am an active participant.

49:20.916 --> 49:23.999
Together, we stand united, protesting..."

49:24.086 --> 49:26.874
No. Uh, should it be "united we stand"?

49:26.964 --> 49:30.207
- Like the Pledge of Allegiance?
- No. "We stand united."

49:30.301 --> 49:33.919
"Protesting how unfair this system is."

49:34.013 --> 49:35.879
"How unfair this system is."

49:35.973 --> 49:38.590
No, no.
"How unfair this system is."

49:38.684 --> 49:41.392
Yes, yes, that's it.
And punch the words. Don't forget.

49:41.479 --> 49:44.847
- You think this is gonna work?
-[Alison] This gotta work.

49:44.940 --> 49:47.147
- It's the only play we got.
-[crowd chanting] Free Judy King!

49:47.234 --> 49:50.067
They sure ain't chanting for Poussey
out there. Are they, T?

49:50.154 --> 49:55.866
"The waiter served a dinner roll
to the woman that was well buttered."

49:55.951 --> 49:57.066
Come on, guys.

49:57.161 --> 50:00.028
Who can fix the misplaced modifier
in that sentence?

50:00.956 --> 50:01.946
Anyone?

50:04.627 --> 50:05.617
Janae?

50:08.380 --> 50:12.840
"The waiter served a dinner roll
that was well buttered to the woman."

50:12.927 --> 50:14.213
Everyone?

50:15.221 --> 50:16.757
Do we see why?

50:17.890 --> 50:18.925
[school bell ringing]

50:20.434 --> 50:21.799
Okay, we'll pick up here tomorrow

50:21.894 --> 50:24.010
and then we'll move on
to dangling modifiers.

50:24.104 --> 50:26.766
Janae?
A word, please.

50:33.531 --> 50:36.694
I need your mom to sign this,
so she knows you got a D.

50:36.784 --> 50:39.651
It's hard for me to write grades
like this on your work, Janae.

50:39.745 --> 50:41.611
I know what you're capable of.

50:41.705 --> 50:44.413
Whatever.
Not like it's a real paper.

50:44.500 --> 50:45.615
What do you mean?

50:45.709 --> 50:49.498
I mean, we ain't quoting secondary sources
using APA or MLA,

50:49.588 --> 50:52.250
and we ain't studying SAT words
or growing salad,

50:52.341 --> 50:53.831
and we don't even
have a library in this school

50:53.926 --> 50:56.463
'cause it got made into a nursery
for our fucking hood rat babies!

50:56.554 --> 50:57.544
Janae.

50:57.638 --> 51:00.551
Two zip codes from here
they got laptops and art galleries.

51:00.641 --> 51:03.474
They got so much culture, they ain't
even knowin' they stealin' ours.

51:03.561 --> 51:05.143
It's a load of shit.

51:08.065 --> 51:09.146
You're right.

51:11.318 --> 51:13.559
I wish you weren't, but it's true.

51:13.654 --> 51:16.396
The Thurston students are
privileged and advantaged,

51:16.490 --> 51:19.448
and sometimes you feel like you have to
work twice as hard to get half as far,

51:19.535 --> 51:21.697
but that doesn't mean you shouldn't do it.

51:21.787 --> 51:23.698
Okay?
You belong with the brightest--

51:23.789 --> 51:26.281
But why even bother
playin' a game that's rigged?

51:26.375 --> 51:27.865
Courtney's going
to a science camp this summer

51:27.960 --> 51:30.418
that cost more than my dad makes
in three months.

51:30.504 --> 51:31.994
How could I ever compete?

51:34.049 --> 51:35.835
I'll see ya, Miss Fowler.

51:43.517 --> 51:44.507
[Pennsatucky] I don't know, you guys.

51:44.602 --> 51:46.559
I just think that we should have
a little bit of fun with him,

51:46.645 --> 51:48.511
you know, like, torture him.

51:48.606 --> 51:50.563
One by one.
I'll go first.

51:50.649 --> 51:52.139
[Coates panting]

51:54.695 --> 51:57.813
Nah, I don't like that show.
Change the channel.

51:57.906 --> 52:00.147
-[panting]
{grunts}

52:00.242 --> 52:01.698
These guard uniforms are itchy.

52:04.580 --> 52:07.447
Maybe we should change them
after we dump him?

52:07.541 --> 52:09.498
[Leanne] Yeah!
Let's wear bedsheet togas and trip again.

52:09.585 --> 52:10.996
Mmm, yeah!

52:11.086 --> 52:12.872
Oh, yeah.
And maybe we'll find the gun that way.

52:12.963 --> 52:15.295
'Cause we'll go, like, full circle
and remember where we put it.

52:15.382 --> 52:16.372
[Leanne] Yeah.

52:16.467 --> 52:17.548
[Pennsatucky] Freeze!

52:17.635 --> 52:20.172
Put your hands up!
Put your hands up! Get over there.

52:20.262 --> 52:24.096
- You stole our gun?
- No, it was in her belt.

52:24.183 --> 52:26.971
- Angie, are you fucking kidding me?
- What?

52:27.061 --> 52:28.927
You put it on your belt!

52:29.021 --> 52:31.012
[sighs] I didn't even know
I was wearing a belt.

52:31.940 --> 52:33.726
I must have put it on
when I was fucked up.

52:33.817 --> 52:38.152
Which is weird, because I hate belts.
They give me camel toe.

52:38.238 --> 52:39.444
[sighs]

52:39.531 --> 52:43.320
Intake is your best bet out, okay?
But be really careful in the hallways.

52:43.410 --> 52:44.445
Here, take it.

52:45.329 --> 52:46.410
[grunts]

52:46.497 --> 52:47.987
Oh, shit!

52:48.082 --> 52:49.197
- What the fuck!
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

52:49.291 --> 52:50.326
Shit. I'm sorry! It was...

52:50.417 --> 52:52.158
-[Leanne] Shut the fuck...
- It was an accident.

52:52.252 --> 52:54.584
You shot my favorite finger,

52:54.672 --> 52:56.583
-you fucking asshole!
- Go.

52:56.674 --> 52:58.665
- But I can't leave you.
- You have to go, okay?

52:58.759 --> 52:59.920
Just go. Hurry.

53:00.010 --> 53:01.967
- Ooh... fuck. [groans]
-[Angie] Oh, my God.

53:02.054 --> 53:03.715
-[groaning] Fucker!
- Are you gonna die?

53:05.015 --> 53:07.177
- You are so gonna pay for this.
-[groans]

53:08.519 --> 53:09.975
- Get her!
-[Angie] Bitch!

53:24.785 --> 53:27.243
What? No...
No, I gotta do the PR.

53:28.122 --> 53:29.237
[inmates gasping]

53:40.134 --> 53:41.920
-[reporters clamoring]
-[reporter] Judy. Judy King.

53:42.010 --> 53:43.921
Judy King, are you a Muslim now?

53:44.012 --> 53:47.050
Judy. Judy King.
Are you a Muslim now?

53:47.141 --> 53:48.256
[clamoring continues]

53:48.350 --> 53:50.887
You want me to talk first
or make an introduction?

53:50.978 --> 53:52.560
-[crowd chanting] Judy!
- No, I'll start.

53:52.646 --> 53:53.886
[reporter] Did they hurt you at all?

53:53.981 --> 53:56.063
- Are you in anyjeopardy?
-[chanting continues]

53:56.150 --> 53:57.390
[crowd quiets down]

53:58.610 --> 54:00.851
[Taystee] Good morning.
My name...

54:01.864 --> 54:05.823
is Tasha Jefferson
and I'm an inmate here at Litchfield.

54:05.909 --> 54:08.071
Two days ago,

54:08.162 --> 54:12.747
our friend and fellow inmate,
Poussey Washington,

54:12.833 --> 54:14.949
was murdered by a prison guard.

54:15.043 --> 54:17.034
[camera shutters clicking]

54:17.129 --> 54:18.494
Poussey Washington.

54:19.381 --> 54:23.340
And I'm sayin' her name again
because it can't ever be said enough.

54:24.845 --> 54:28.258
Now, as you can see,
Judy King ain't injured

54:28.348 --> 54:30.339
and she ain't a hostage.

54:31.226 --> 54:34.969
And she has a statement
that she'd like to make at this time.

54:35.939 --> 54:38.271
[Judy] And good morning,
my fellow Americans.

54:39.318 --> 54:43.312
"This prison has put me
through unimaginable suffering.

54:43.405 --> 54:47.649
- And I am not a victim of this riot--"
- No, [stutters] she will not--

54:47.743 --> 54:50.030
She is not gonna be making a statement.

54:51.038 --> 54:52.620
Sorry.

54:52.706 --> 54:54.697
She will not be speaking for us

54:54.792 --> 54:59.787
because Judy King can't speak
for the inmates of this prison.

54:59.880 --> 55:01.996
She was kept separate from us,

55:02.090 --> 55:06.379
held in a private room
with better treatment and a seltzer-maker.

55:06.470 --> 55:11.215
And moments after our friend,
Poussey Washington,

55:11.308 --> 55:15.347
was murdered by a guard
for doin' nothin' wrong,

55:15.437 --> 55:19.647
Judy King was packing her bags
to go home on early release.

55:20.651 --> 55:25.566
Because she's rich and white and powerful.

55:26.573 --> 55:28.655
[camera shutters clicking]

55:28.742 --> 55:32.360
Now, our fight is not with Judy King.

55:32.454 --> 55:36.493
Our fight is with a system
that don't give a damn

55:36.583 --> 55:42.295
about poor people and brown people
and poor brown people.

55:43.257 --> 55:44.713
[sobbing] Our fight...

55:46.009 --> 55:47.420
is with the folks...

55:48.804 --> 55:52.513
who hold our demands in their hands.

55:53.684 --> 55:55.766
Which you people need to read,
by the way,

55:55.853 --> 55:59.437
and stop watching this fool shit
comin' out of here online

55:59.523 --> 56:05.644
and get a hold of our demand list because
those demands are fair and necessary,

56:05.737 --> 56:09.571
and show that we intend
to keep this demonstration

56:09.658 --> 56:13.196
peaceful and focused on change.

56:14.955 --> 56:18.038
Now, Judy King is free to leave.

56:18.125 --> 56:20.332
She's not a hostage
and you can have her back.

56:20.419 --> 56:22.626
Judy, get the hell out of here.

56:23.547 --> 56:25.379
[reporters clamoring]

56:29.261 --> 56:31.673
