  you've been in the presence of

42:20.272 --> 42:23.439

I drew my life
as an illustrator.

42:33.218 --> 42:35.318
- Frye, this is excellent.

You know, if <i> Curse of the Lost</i>

42:38.189 --> 42:40.456
which it is sure to,
perhaps you could draw

42:40.458 --> 42:42.858
   some of the scenes for it.
          - All right.

      But I don't work for free.

42:48.199 --> 42:50.199

  there will be no more trouble.

  - You must be proud of him.
         - Yes, I am.

43:05.317 --> 43:07.817
I'd be a lot prouder of him
if he wasn't a policeman.

43:07.885 --> 43:09.819
He's capable
of so much more.
