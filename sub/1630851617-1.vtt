00:56.833 --> 01:09.208
sincerely

02:12.625 --> 02:14.708
It was quite sudden.

02:15.167 --> 02:18.542
If she wasn't feeling well,
she should have called us.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.917
I bet she didn't say anything
because she thought you were busy.

02:26.708 --> 02:30.708
Grandma was always like that.
You know that, right?

02:30.792 --> 02:31.625
Daisy.

02:32.250 --> 02:33.250
Are you blaming…

02:36.083 --> 02:37.000
me for this?

02:39.625 --> 02:40.500
Not really.

02:41.000 --> 02:41.833
I just think…

02:42.333 --> 02:44.958
Grandma must have wanted to see you more.

02:46.083 --> 02:49.000
She must have wanted to see you more.

02:50.833 --> 02:51.708
Because…

02:52.333 --> 02:53.292
Grandma…

02:54.417 --> 02:56.083
she loved you so, Mom.

02:59.000 --> 02:59.875
She…

03:00.833 --> 03:03.708
lost her own mother
when she was still young.

03:18.792 --> 03:19.625
Letters?

03:22.083 --> 03:26.875
Those are the letters Grandma received
from Great-Grandma after she died.

03:27.375 --> 03:29.792
Letters from someone who had died?

03:30.292 --> 03:32.208
She asked a doll to be her scribe,

03:32.292 --> 03:36.583
so Grandma would receive a letter
every year on her birthday,

03:36.667 --> 03:38.083
even after she was gone.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.208
A doll? Are there dolls
who can write letters?

03:42.792 --> 03:47.333
A long time ago, there was a man
who made a typewriter for his blind wife.

03:47.917 --> 03:51.375
He called the machine
an "auto memory doll."

03:51.875 --> 03:57.208
Later, people began using the word "doll"
to refer to women who worked as scribes.

03:57.708 --> 04:00.792
Scribes?
They wrote letters for other people?

04:00.875 --> 04:01.708
Yes.

04:01.792 --> 04:06.333
Back then, many people
couldn't read and write.

04:07.208 --> 04:11.458
Later, more people learned how to write
and telephones became common.

04:12.042 --> 04:14.167
Fewer people send letters now.

04:14.250 --> 04:17.208
That job probably doesn't exist anymore.

04:18.417 --> 04:22.458
Back then, when a person wanted
to write something special or difficult,

04:22.542 --> 04:24.167
they'd ask a doll to do it.

04:28.042 --> 04:31.958
Grandma really treasured
those letters very much.

04:33.833 --> 04:34.667
I see.

04:44.583 --> 04:47.875
We have to go back now.
Our patients are waiting.

04:53.750 --> 04:54.583
Yes.

04:55.083 --> 04:56.333
You too, Daisy.

04:57.083 --> 05:00.000
I'm going to stay here a while longer.

05:01.042 --> 05:03.542
Grandma would be lonely
without anyone here

05:04.375 --> 05:05.958
after the funeral, right?

05:07.125 --> 05:07.958
Daisy.

05:08.667 --> 05:10.458
Why don't you leave, Mom?

05:11.250 --> 05:14.833
You always put your job before family.

05:16.500 --> 05:17.542
That's not true.

05:19.292 --> 05:21.042
I care about Grandma.

05:21.125 --> 05:24.125
I care about the both of you a lot!

05:30.208 --> 05:32.333
Come, I'll take you to the station.

05:34.625 --> 05:35.458
Daisy.

05:36.042 --> 05:38.750
We'll come back after work.

05:53.250 --> 05:54.083
Grandma.

05:54.833 --> 05:57.500
I said an awful thing to Mom again.

05:59.167 --> 06:00.833
Though I know…

06:00.917 --> 06:03.625
Mom has a really hard job.

06:23.208 --> 06:26.417
"Ann, happy eighth birthday."

06:27.792 --> 06:29.792
<i>Many sad things may be happening.</i>

06:30.833 --> 06:33.708
<i>And you might be feeling</i>
<i>overwhelmed right now.</i>

06:33.792 --> 06:35.042
<i>But don't lose hope.</i>

06:35.125 --> 06:38.458
<i>Even if you're sad and feel like crying…</i>

06:38.958 --> 06:39.958
<i>don't forget:</i>

06:41.125 --> 06:44.458
<i>Your mother loves you very much.</i>

07:01.875 --> 07:05.042
<i>Ann, happy tenth birthday.</i>

07:05.875 --> 07:08.833
<i>You must have grown up quite a bit.</i>

07:10.125 --> 07:13.542
<i>But I'm sure you still love</i>
<i>reading and dancing.</i>

07:14.583 --> 07:17.125
<i>Have you outgrown riddles and bugs?</i>

07:19.625 --> 07:21.833
<i>Happy 18th birthday.</i>

07:23.208 --> 07:24.708
<i>You're grown up now.</i>

07:25.667 --> 07:27.208
<i>Are you in love?</i>

07:28.583 --> 07:30.542
<i>I can't give you love advice.</i>

07:31.417 --> 07:35.583
<i>But I'm sure whomever you choose</i>
<i>is a wonderful person.</i>

07:40.625 --> 07:42.375
<i>Happy birthday, Ann.</i>

07:43.708 --> 07:45.500
<i>You've lived for 20 years now.</i>

07:45.583 --> 07:46.667
<i>That's amazing.</i>

07:47.375 --> 07:51.042
<i>But remember, even adults</i>
<i>are allowed to complain sometimes.</i>

07:51.875 --> 07:55.250
<i>Whenever you're feeling down,</i>
<i>remember that I am with you.</i>

07:57.542 --> 07:58.375
<i>Ann.</i>

08:00.542 --> 08:01.667
<i>I will always…</i>

08:02.167 --> 08:03.000
<i>always…</i>

08:04.042 --> 08:05.542
<i>be watching over you.</i>

08:07.792 --> 08:08.625
<i>Ann.</i>

08:16.958 --> 08:20.250
She received a letter like this…

08:21.542 --> 08:23.208
every year on her birthday?

08:27.958 --> 08:28.958
Great-Grandma<i>…</i>

08:29.958 --> 08:33.375
must have been really worried
about Grandma.

08:44.875 --> 08:46.542
A newspaper clipping?

08:48.583 --> 08:49.750
Who is this person?

09:27.917 --> 09:29.542
<i>Those letters were written…</i>

09:30.458 --> 09:33.833
<i>by a doll who was very famous back then.</i>

09:38.583 --> 09:41.208
<i>She wrote a love letter</i>
<i>for a princess once.</i>

09:43.625 --> 09:48.542
<i>She also wrote the lyrics for an opera</i>
<i>performed by a popular singer.</i>

09:54.625 --> 09:59.875
<i>And she even wrote the script</i>
<i>for a play of a famous playwright.</i>

10:02.792 --> 10:05.583
<i>She worked for a postal company in Leiden.</i>

10:06.083 --> 10:08.875
<i>But she quit when she turned 18.</i>

10:09.375 --> 10:11.875
<i>Afterwards, there was no news about her.</i>

10:13.417 --> 10:14.958
<i>The name of that doll was…</i>

10:21.875 --> 10:31.833
VIOLET EVERGARDEN

10:37.792 --> 10:40.083
I picked her up on the northern front.

10:40.583 --> 10:42.000
She doesn't have a name.

10:47.458 --> 10:49.500
Hey! Say hello!

10:50.208 --> 10:53.333
You can't treat a child like that!

10:55.042 --> 10:55.875
Gil.

10:56.375 --> 10:58.000
She's no child.

10:58.917 --> 11:00.250
She's a weapon.

11:01.208 --> 11:03.750
Just a tool, a tool of war.

11:09.542 --> 11:12.333
Would it be okay if I gave you a name?

11:14.125 --> 11:14.958
Violet.

11:16.500 --> 11:17.333
Violet.

11:18.333 --> 11:23.000
I have a feeling you'll grow
into the name when you're older.

11:23.583 --> 11:25.000
Don't be a tool.

11:25.792 --> 11:27.792
Be a person who embodies her name.

11:34.500 --> 11:36.500
<i>Violet Evergarden.</i>

11:53.875 --> 11:54.750
Come forward.

12:10.792 --> 12:13.833
The writer of this year's hymn to the sea…

12:14.667 --> 12:18.375
will now present the hymn
to this year's goddess of the sea,

12:18.458 --> 12:20.167
Ms. Ilma Felice.

13:28.458 --> 13:32.000
The hymn to the sea was very good.

13:32.083 --> 13:32.917
Violet.

13:33.417 --> 13:35.875
You must have truly worked hard on it.

13:36.542 --> 13:37.417
Violet.

13:38.542 --> 13:39.375
Yes.

13:40.750 --> 13:43.000
It was different from a normal letter.

13:43.875 --> 13:45.458
The sea is boundless.

13:47.042 --> 13:48.875
It is home to many organisms.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.042
It is abundant and beautiful.

13:54.042 --> 13:56.583
However, it doesn't have

13:56.667 --> 13:59.375
achievements, status, or personality.

14:00.125 --> 14:02.250
It was hard to write praises for it.

14:04.708 --> 14:05.708
Well…

14:07.500 --> 14:08.583
Okay!

14:08.667 --> 14:10.375
I'll write it next year!

14:10.875 --> 14:15.458
You can't write the hymn to the sea
unless you're selected to do it.

14:16.208 --> 14:19.583
I'm gonna start writing
lots of great letters

14:19.667 --> 14:21.375
and make sure they choose me!

14:21.458 --> 14:22.458
Right, Violet?

14:24.208 --> 14:26.500
Yes. I hope they choose you.

14:28.042 --> 14:28.958
Leave it to me!

14:29.625 --> 14:30.458
Yes.

14:31.292 --> 14:32.792
Violet Evergarden.

14:37.750 --> 14:39.708
Mr. Mayor… and the mayor's wife.

14:41.917 --> 14:45.250
Violet, this is the Mayor of Leiden

14:45.333 --> 14:46.542
and his wife.

14:54.083 --> 14:56.417
I am pleased to make your acquaintance.

14:59.125 --> 15:02.250
If it is your wish, I will travel
anywhere to meet your request.

15:03.083 --> 15:05.000
Auto memory doll…

15:06.458 --> 15:08.542
Violet Evergarden, at your service.

15:11.875 --> 15:16.000
You're so beautiful.
You really do look just like a doll.

15:16.083 --> 15:17.000
Yes.

15:17.667 --> 15:20.458
I've heard so much about you.

15:21.375 --> 15:24.000
It was I who recommended you to be

15:24.083 --> 15:27.083
the person to write the hymn for the sea

15:27.167 --> 15:29.958
for the Festival of Thanksgiving.

15:30.667 --> 15:33.208
The public oath you wrote for King Damian…

15:34.292 --> 15:38.583
of the Kingdom of Flugel
was a kind of public love letter.

15:39.292 --> 15:41.708
It was quite beautiful,

15:41.792 --> 15:44.583
as beautiful as you are.

15:48.375 --> 15:50.792
When I wrote the oath for the coronation,

15:50.875 --> 15:55.333
all I did was put the visions and
aspirations of the king into words.

15:56.042 --> 15:58.333
Although you describe me as beautiful,

15:59.042 --> 16:03.625
there is no correlation
between the words I write and myself.

16:04.542 --> 16:05.625
I mean no offense.

16:10.292 --> 16:12.708
Violet, in other words…

16:13.292 --> 16:17.292
In other words,
I am giving you a compliment.

16:17.917 --> 16:20.958
Right now, you are a doll,
but before that,

16:21.042 --> 16:26.792
you were a brave soldier
who saved Leidenschaftlich.

16:39.375 --> 16:41.500
I didn't save Leidenschaftlich.

16:42.083 --> 16:44.542
It was the countless soldiers who fought.

16:44.625 --> 16:49.000
But… the war claimed so many other lives.

16:50.125 --> 16:51.625
I too took many lives.

16:52.333 --> 16:53.250
Therefore…

16:55.208 --> 16:58.958
I am not a person who deserves praise.

17:12.625 --> 17:13.708
Should we eat?

17:14.500 --> 17:15.625
I want yakisoba.

17:16.208 --> 17:18.083
Try something else for a change.

17:18.167 --> 17:19.458
Okay.

17:58.417 --> 17:59.333
Violet.

18:03.208 --> 18:04.167
Erica.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.333
It's been a while.

18:06.417 --> 18:09.000
Hey, you look like you're doing well!

18:09.083 --> 18:09.917
Yes.

18:10.417 --> 18:12.375
President, it's been a long time.

18:12.458 --> 18:14.708
How's being the playwright's assistant?

18:15.375 --> 18:18.667
The same playwright that
Violet scribed for, right?

18:19.333 --> 18:20.167
Yes.

18:20.875 --> 18:25.292
I introduced Erica to him
after we went to see his play.

18:30.125 --> 18:33.542
I asked if I could be his apprentice.

18:40.083 --> 18:43.000
He writes and rewrites things all day.

18:43.583 --> 18:45.875
It's hard keeping up with the typing.

18:47.042 --> 18:48.417
But I'm learning a lot.

18:51.458 --> 18:53.250
Do you want some yakisoba?

18:53.333 --> 18:56.250
Benedict, we're trying
to have a conversation.

18:56.750 --> 18:59.375
Don't talk to me like that.
You're so mean.

19:00.250 --> 19:03.292
Would you like to walk around
the festival with us?

19:03.375 --> 19:04.625
I'm sorry.

19:04.708 --> 19:06.750
Thank you for inviting me.

19:07.417 --> 19:11.458
But we have a rehearsal
for next month's play.

19:14.083 --> 19:15.833
Did you write the script!

19:15.917 --> 19:17.000
Yeah.

19:17.083 --> 19:20.083
It's a small play we'll do
at the community theater.

19:20.583 --> 19:21.833
But please come see it.

19:24.167 --> 19:25.458
I'll be going now.

19:27.083 --> 19:28.542
See you later.

19:31.083 --> 19:31.917
Okay.

19:39.542 --> 19:43.083
It goes to show, anything's possible
if you wish hard for it.

19:47.833 --> 19:50.333
Not everything
no matter how hard you wish.

19:51.792 --> 19:53.250
What should you do then?

19:58.125 --> 20:00.042
I'm going to excuse myself too.

20:01.083 --> 20:04.208
I have a lot of work to do.

20:04.292 --> 20:06.042
You can take the day off.

20:06.125 --> 20:07.417
It's the festival!

20:09.625 --> 20:10.750
No.

20:10.833 --> 20:14.333
It'll interfere
with my planned work schedule.

20:14.833 --> 20:15.875
I'll go back now.

21:11.708 --> 21:12.542
Major.

21:21.250 --> 21:22.083
Major?

21:37.042 --> 21:37.917
Save yourself.

21:38.750 --> 21:39.750
Leave me here.

21:40.708 --> 21:41.917
You have to run.

22:09.958 --> 22:11.208
I won't let you!

22:11.292 --> 22:13.792
I won't let you die, Major!

22:18.000 --> 22:19.167
Stop!

22:22.292 --> 22:24.042
Just stop!

22:29.000 --> 22:30.333
You have to live.

22:34.208 --> 22:35.458
Violet.

22:36.750 --> 22:39.208
You have to live.

22:40.125 --> 22:41.917
Be free.

22:48.042 --> 22:49.333
With all my heart.

22:55.417 --> 22:56.583
I love you.

23:32.417 --> 23:34.708
<i>Dearest Major Gilbert,</i>

23:36.000 --> 23:39.875
<i>I had a flashback about you today.</i>

23:41.250 --> 23:43.917
<i>No matter what I see,</i>
<i>and no matter what I do…</i>

23:45.000 --> 23:47.708
<i>my memories are connected to you.</i>

23:49.000 --> 23:50.208
<i>As time passes…</i>

23:51.000 --> 23:52.458
<i>and the past fades away…</i>

23:53.708 --> 23:57.833
<i>my memories of the time</i>
<i>we spent together still come back to life.</i>

23:58.458 --> 24:00.458
<i>You kept me by your side.</i>

24:01.042 --> 24:05.333
<i>When I was unable to do anything,</i>
<i>you taught me how to live.</i>

24:06.833 --> 24:07.917
<i>And you gave me…</i>

24:09.417 --> 24:10.417
<i>the words…</i>

24:15.208 --> 24:16.375
<i>"I love you"…</i>

24:18.000 --> 24:19.667
<i>for the first time.</i>

24:21.333 --> 24:25.083
<i>That's why I can't help writing</i>
<i>to you again like this.</i>

24:29.042 --> 24:29.875
<i>I hope…</i>

24:30.583 --> 24:32.750
<i>this letter will reach you someday.</i>

24:34.375 --> 24:36.792
<i>And I pray that my wishes will come true.</i>

25:03.792 --> 25:07.042
<i>That comes out to three Corse in change.</i>

25:10.625 --> 25:12.250
Thank you very much.

25:12.333 --> 25:16.458
It weighs 1,2 Leib.
That will be 11 Corse, please.

25:24.917 --> 25:27.042
Hello. This is the CH Postal Company.

25:27.125 --> 25:30.250
If it is your wish, I will travel anywhere
to meet your request.

25:30.333 --> 25:33.792
Auto memory doll,
Iris Cannary, at your service.

25:35.417 --> 25:36.250
Yes.

25:37.500 --> 25:38.417
She's here.

25:46.708 --> 25:48.417
Thank you for waiting.

25:48.500 --> 25:53.083
The schedule of the doll you requested
is booked for the next three months.

25:53.750 --> 25:55.333
Could I help you instead?

25:59.000 --> 26:00.708
Oh… I see.

26:01.458 --> 26:02.542
I understand.

26:03.042 --> 26:06.375
I'll make your reservation
for three months from today.

26:07.625 --> 26:09.458
Yes… that's right.

26:10.292 --> 26:11.125
Goodbye.

26:12.417 --> 26:13.792
Iris.

26:13.875 --> 26:16.833
Don't give the customers that attitude.

26:16.917 --> 26:19.458
They can't see my attitude
over the telephone.

26:19.542 --> 26:21.708
Your emotions show in your voice.

26:25.083 --> 26:26.333
All right.

26:27.625 --> 26:30.542
You have lots of reservations too, right?

26:31.125 --> 26:32.875
Not as many as you, Cattleya.

26:34.667 --> 26:38.292
At this rate, I'll never move up
from third place around here.

26:44.625 --> 26:46.208
Thanks for your hard work.

26:46.875 --> 26:49.333
Oh, president, good evening.

26:50.208 --> 26:54.833
This week has been busy, right? I hope
you get some rest over the weekend.

26:54.917 --> 26:58.042
I'm going on a business trip this weekend.

26:59.167 --> 27:03.625
I've been asked to be the secretary
for the commerce treaty with Gardarik.

27:04.208 --> 27:05.375
Oh, that's right.

27:06.417 --> 27:09.292
I'm planning to attend
the mayor's wife's party.

27:09.792 --> 27:12.125
I'm going to look for new customers.

27:13.292 --> 27:15.708
You all work too hard.

27:16.708 --> 27:18.875
I recently took up tennis.

27:18.958 --> 27:21.542
I was looking
for someone to play with me.

27:22.542 --> 27:24.708
Don't you have any sense of crisis?

27:25.542 --> 27:27.750
We must work hard while we still can.

27:30.500 --> 27:35.208
People will stop sending letters someday
all because of that horrible machine.

27:50.417 --> 27:53.417
They'll finish building
that radio tower soon.

27:54.208 --> 27:57.792
When that happens,
everyone is going to get a telephone.

28:00.500 --> 28:01.458
You're right.

28:02.708 --> 28:04.875
A lot of things are going to change.

28:05.792 --> 28:08.875
Our postal company
will gradually change as well.

28:09.958 --> 28:13.750
Someday, a doll's job will be considered…

28:14.375 --> 28:15.208
old-fashioned.

28:17.042 --> 28:21.083
It will become obsolete and disappear.

28:23.000 --> 28:26.875
That's exactly why
we must work while we still can!

28:29.667 --> 28:32.417
Violet, are you going to the party too?

28:33.458 --> 28:35.083
No… I…

28:35.167 --> 28:37.667
Don't make me bring my rival to the party!

28:37.750 --> 28:38.583
Yes.

28:39.333 --> 28:40.708
Don't make her do that.

28:41.667 --> 28:44.208
I have my own plans for the weekend.

28:51.083 --> 28:51.917
All right!

28:54.917 --> 28:57.917
Come on! Why can't you hit less hard!

28:58.500 --> 29:01.083
I would if I were playing with a girl,

29:01.167 --> 29:02.792
but it's just you today.

29:02.875 --> 29:04.667
Everyone's so busy.

29:05.292 --> 29:07.417
Even Violet turned me down.

29:08.042 --> 29:11.583
I think it's nice
she's going out for a change.

29:12.125 --> 29:14.292
But it's nice having her around.

29:14.375 --> 29:16.792
It helps me get attention from girls.

29:17.417 --> 29:19.542
When I'm out delivering, people ask me,

29:19.625 --> 29:21.750
"Are you from the CH Postal Company?

29:21.833 --> 29:25.250
Where the doll named Violet works?
Introduce me to her."

29:26.458 --> 29:30.000
Don't use Violet
for your own dirty motives!

29:31.083 --> 29:31.917
But…

29:34.042 --> 29:35.917
I wonder where she went today.

29:40.042 --> 29:41.542
You're so overprotective.

30:08.417 --> 30:09.250
Captain.

30:11.167 --> 30:12.292
So it was you…

30:12.875 --> 30:15.875
who's been leaving flowers
for my mother every month.

30:16.708 --> 30:20.083
I should've come tomorrow,
on the anniversary of her death,

30:20.167 --> 30:22.375
but your other relatives might come.

30:25.750 --> 30:28.000
Did I trouble you?

30:30.000 --> 30:30.833
No.

30:32.042 --> 30:35.250
But you didn't need to come all this way.

30:35.833 --> 30:37.250
It's your day off today.

30:38.667 --> 30:41.250
I was able to come
because it's my day off.

30:44.375 --> 30:46.125
Are you here on his behalf?

30:50.500 --> 30:54.000
I'm not doing this
on behalf of the major.

30:55.458 --> 30:58.500
I came of my own free will.

31:02.458 --> 31:05.583
How many years have gone by
since the end of the war?

31:06.667 --> 31:08.000
You understand, right?

31:08.750 --> 31:09.625
He's not…

31:13.042 --> 31:14.292
Forget Gilbert.

31:14.958 --> 31:15.875
Forget him.

31:19.042 --> 31:19.875
It is…

31:20.417 --> 31:22.250
too difficult to forget.

31:24.042 --> 31:25.292
As long as I'm alive…

31:27.542 --> 31:29.042
I can't forget him.

31:47.958 --> 31:48.792
Hey!

32:04.792 --> 32:05.625
Violet.

32:07.500 --> 32:10.292
No. That flower is not a violet.

32:10.375 --> 32:11.708
It's called a pansy.

32:12.792 --> 32:13.625
I see.

32:14.500 --> 32:16.000
You know a lot.

32:22.042 --> 32:23.875
<i>Even if I never see him again.</i>

32:24.500 --> 32:25.875
"I can't…

32:25.958 --> 32:27.250
forget him."

33:08.042 --> 33:08.958
My ribbon.

33:19.583 --> 33:21.167
Hello. CH Postal Company.

33:21.250 --> 33:23.583
<i>Um… Can I speak to a doll?</i>

33:24.667 --> 33:26.250
I'm a doll.

33:26.333 --> 33:29.333
<i>Really? I have a job for you.</i>

33:30.417 --> 33:32.250
<i>Can you come to my place?</i>

33:33.500 --> 33:35.792
Our company is closed today.

33:35.875 --> 33:37.375
<i>What? Really?</i>

33:38.500 --> 33:39.333
<i>I see…</i>

33:40.083 --> 33:44.333
Pardon me, but by the sound
of your voice, you sound quite young.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.875
What does age have to do
with writing letters?

33:47.958 --> 33:50.958
Don't dolls go wherever you ask them to?

33:51.042 --> 33:51.875
Is that a lie?

33:54.083 --> 33:55.958
No. It's not a lie.

33:56.042 --> 33:57.083
<i>Then come over!</i>

34:18.417 --> 34:19.583
Who is it?

34:19.667 --> 34:22.250
I'm the doll from the CH Postal Company.

34:23.000 --> 34:24.750
Oh, come in!

34:25.333 --> 34:26.208
Excuse me.

34:38.875 --> 34:40.375
I am pleased to meet you.

34:41.375 --> 34:45.000
If it is your wish, I will travel anywhere
to meet your request.

34:45.958 --> 34:50.250
Auto memory doll
Violet Evergarden at your service.

34:55.667 --> 34:56.792
You really came.

34:57.667 --> 34:59.417
I came as you requested.

35:02.917 --> 35:05.000
You look young. Are you up to it?

35:06.917 --> 35:08.458
I'll do my best.

35:09.042 --> 35:09.875
Yuris!

35:10.458 --> 35:11.417
Brother!

35:11.500 --> 35:12.542
We're here!

35:12.625 --> 35:13.542
We're coming in!

35:14.875 --> 35:15.958
Just a moment!

35:17.958 --> 35:19.458
Hide! Hurry!

35:20.250 --> 35:21.333
Hurry!

35:26.542 --> 35:27.667
Brother!

35:29.375 --> 35:31.583
Yuris, was someone just here?

35:31.667 --> 35:32.500
No.

35:33.208 --> 35:36.208
Oh, really? I thought
I heard someone talking.

35:37.875 --> 35:39.125
How are you feeling?

35:40.708 --> 35:43.125
Stop asking me the same thing every day.

35:45.042 --> 35:45.875
Are you okay?

35:47.750 --> 35:49.875
If I were okay, I wouldn't be here.

35:51.792 --> 35:52.625
Forgive me.

35:55.417 --> 35:57.750
Brother!

35:57.833 --> 36:00.583
I'll read you my story book!

36:00.667 --> 36:03.500
I don't read story books.
That's so stupid.

36:09.250 --> 36:11.792
Your brother isn't feeling well.

36:13.167 --> 36:14.625
It's worse than that.

36:15.083 --> 36:18.875
I had three surgeries and been
in the hospital for a whole year.

36:20.417 --> 36:24.333
Yuris, Lucas said
he wanted to come visit you.

36:24.833 --> 36:26.500
He said he wants to see you.

36:27.583 --> 36:28.792
I don't want him to.

36:29.292 --> 36:31.583
Why not? You two were so close--

36:31.667 --> 36:33.500
I said I don't want to see him!

36:35.125 --> 36:36.125
What's this?

36:37.292 --> 36:38.125
It's so old--

36:38.208 --> 36:40.667
No! Don't touch that, stupid!

36:43.542 --> 36:44.375
It…

36:44.458 --> 36:46.125
belongs to someone…

36:46.208 --> 36:48.917
who came to visit
the person in the next room.

36:49.583 --> 36:51.500
I'm just holding on to it a bit.

36:55.292 --> 36:56.958
I'm tired now!

37:00.667 --> 37:01.958
Sorry.

37:02.042 --> 37:04.500
We're going for a walk now.

37:05.583 --> 37:06.417
Good idea.

37:07.042 --> 37:08.542
You get some sleep now.

37:10.875 --> 37:11.917
We'll come again.

37:21.917 --> 37:22.750
Sorry.

37:25.042 --> 37:26.708
May I come out now?

37:32.000 --> 37:34.458
Would you please explain…

37:34.958 --> 37:36.583
why I had to stay hidden?

37:37.083 --> 37:38.083
Young master.

37:40.167 --> 37:41.833
You can call me Yuris.

37:43.292 --> 37:44.667
All right, Yuris.

37:46.792 --> 37:51.292
I want to write something without my mom,
dad, and brother knowing about it.

37:53.375 --> 37:54.792
Write a letter?

37:56.042 --> 37:56.875
Yeah.

37:57.625 --> 37:59.417
Letters for the three of them.

38:00.917 --> 38:04.333
Letters for them to read after I'm gone.

38:06.583 --> 38:10.083
So I want you to hold onto them
for a while after we finish.

38:10.958 --> 38:12.583
Don't send them right away.

38:14.208 --> 38:15.125
All right.

38:15.792 --> 38:18.625
You know what I mean?
Can you do stuff like that?

38:21.500 --> 38:23.042
It's not a problem.

38:24.000 --> 38:27.625
I handled a similar request in the past.

38:29.750 --> 38:33.042
There was a girl who was
a little younger than you.

38:33.750 --> 38:36.042
Her mother wrote letters to her…

38:36.875 --> 38:39.208
so that she'd receive a letter from her…

38:39.708 --> 38:43.542
every year on her birthday
for 50 years even after she was gone.

38:44.167 --> 38:47.500
For 50 years?
Does that mean there were 50 letters?

38:48.750 --> 38:49.583
Yes.

38:51.208 --> 38:56.417
Even now, she still receives
one of those letters every year.

39:01.250 --> 39:04.167
I'm sorry but I can't afford that many.

39:05.458 --> 39:08.792
My money's in that tin.
Write as many as it will pay for.

39:13.583 --> 39:15.375
So how many can you write?

39:16.208 --> 39:20.583
If it's three letters… I can write
around 20 characters per letter.

39:21.375 --> 39:22.667
Just 20 characters?

39:23.708 --> 39:24.625
"Dear Mom…

39:25.667 --> 39:26.792
Take care.

39:27.375 --> 39:28.625
Yuris."

39:28.708 --> 39:31.958
That's so short!
Even I can write that much!

39:32.042 --> 39:33.083
I need…

39:33.167 --> 39:36.583
I want the letters to make

39:36.667 --> 39:39.250
my mom, dad, and brother feel better

39:39.333 --> 39:41.333
after reading them!

39:49.375 --> 39:50.208
Yuris.

39:50.833 --> 39:53.458
That is the standard fee.

39:54.042 --> 39:57.917
My company
has a special discount for children.

39:59.542 --> 40:03.167
Therefore, the money
in your tin will be enough

40:03.250 --> 40:06.250
to pay for any letter
you want me to write.

40:06.333 --> 40:07.583
Is that really true!

40:07.667 --> 40:08.833
It's true.

40:09.375 --> 40:10.792
You're making it up!

40:11.500 --> 40:13.583
I didn't make it up.

40:16.458 --> 40:18.917
This special provision was created

40:19.000 --> 40:22.292
so we can perform our duties
during times of emergency.

40:23.958 --> 40:25.958
It's our emergency provision.

40:29.250 --> 40:30.708
I don't really get it.

40:31.958 --> 40:33.917
But… It sounds cool!

40:37.833 --> 40:39.292
It means "good!"

40:40.833 --> 40:42.625
All right, let's get started!

40:56.583 --> 40:57.417
Your hand.

40:59.625 --> 41:01.167
I lost it in the war.

41:02.042 --> 41:04.833
I was also in a hospital a few years ago.

41:05.875 --> 41:07.917
Can you write letters with it?

41:09.250 --> 41:13.417
It took a while to learn
how to use this artificial hand.

41:14.333 --> 41:15.917
But I can use it fine now.

41:16.875 --> 41:19.917
I can even do gestures like this.

41:23.042 --> 41:24.708
You're kind of funny.

41:25.458 --> 41:27.292
People always just say to me:

41:27.375 --> 41:30.333
"How are you feeling?"
"Are you okay?" "Go to sleep."

41:30.417 --> 41:33.667
You're different from Mom,
Dad, and the nurses.

41:36.625 --> 41:38.167
How am I different?

41:38.250 --> 41:41.875
People are always worrying
about me, feeling sorry for me…

41:43.625 --> 41:45.125
and being overprotective.

41:45.750 --> 41:49.167
You know, I'm tired of that stuff.

41:51.583 --> 41:56.167
Understood. I will try to eliminate
those three elements from my emotions.

41:58.000 --> 41:59.375
You really are funny.

42:00.167 --> 42:01.917
All right. Well…

42:04.042 --> 42:05.250
Write me a letter.

42:08.167 --> 42:09.583
Write one to my father.

42:12.167 --> 42:13.125
Your father?

42:14.333 --> 42:15.208
Yeah.

42:15.292 --> 42:17.583
My father went off to the war.

42:17.667 --> 42:20.000
He went to a country
called Leidenschaftlich.

42:21.375 --> 42:25.042
He said he'd come back soon,
but he hasn't returned yet.

42:26.833 --> 42:31.750
That's why I want to tell him that I,
my brother, and my mother are all safe.

42:32.458 --> 42:35.000
Can you write me a letter?

42:42.208 --> 42:45.000
Let's invite Violet out for dinner.

42:46.083 --> 42:48.042
Okay. Let's go to that one place.

42:48.125 --> 42:49.083
That restaurant…

42:49.958 --> 42:53.125
we all went to when Violet first got here.

42:58.167 --> 42:59.000
It's you.

42:59.667 --> 43:01.000
Captain Dietfried.

43:02.292 --> 43:04.000
Lt. Colonel Hodgins.

43:04.083 --> 43:06.083
No, I should call you president.

43:06.583 --> 43:09.875
I always forget that the war has been over

43:09.958 --> 43:11.542
for many years now.

43:13.167 --> 43:14.375
What do you want?

43:17.042 --> 43:17.875
Well…

43:37.292 --> 43:38.208
Violet!

43:41.125 --> 43:41.958
Captain.

43:44.958 --> 43:46.708
Please excuse my…

43:46.792 --> 43:47.625
impertinence.

43:48.875 --> 43:50.500
No. Don't worry about it.

43:51.583 --> 43:52.417
Here.

43:56.667 --> 43:58.583
Is that my…

43:58.667 --> 44:00.958
Did you come to give that back to me?

44:01.708 --> 44:03.667
I noticed you dropped it.

44:07.542 --> 44:11.458
So the place that Violet went to was…

44:12.708 --> 44:13.667
The graveyard…

44:14.333 --> 44:16.417
where the major's mother is buried.

44:19.250 --> 44:20.083
Captain.

44:20.750 --> 44:21.750
Thank you.

44:23.833 --> 44:25.125
All right, then.

44:25.208 --> 44:27.417
Let's dump our stuff and go eat!

44:28.167 --> 44:29.083
Good idea.

44:30.167 --> 44:31.958
Violet, will you join us?

44:32.625 --> 44:33.458
Okay.

44:42.167 --> 44:43.000
Hey!

44:46.000 --> 44:50.792
My family has decided
to get rid of the boat we owned.

44:52.375 --> 44:53.667
The boat?

44:54.583 --> 44:55.417
Yeah.

44:56.833 --> 44:57.667
My brother…

44:58.375 --> 45:00.917
sailed in it many times
when he was a child.

45:02.167 --> 45:06.708
It contains many of his books
and the toys he played with.

45:06.792 --> 45:09.125
If there's anything you want…

45:11.625 --> 45:13.833
Could I have them?

45:15.708 --> 45:17.333
It's a bunch of junk, really.

45:17.417 --> 45:18.458
I'm going!

45:18.542 --> 45:21.208
I'm going wherever the boat is docked!

45:26.167 --> 45:30.083
I didn't know
you went to her grave every month.

45:30.917 --> 45:32.792
Should I have told you?

45:33.292 --> 45:34.333
No.

45:34.417 --> 45:35.708
You don't have to.

45:36.583 --> 45:39.375
You're free to do
as you like in your free time.

45:40.833 --> 45:41.667
You're going…

45:42.625 --> 45:43.708
to visit the boat?

45:44.333 --> 45:46.125
I'll tell you when I go.

45:46.208 --> 45:48.167
I said you don't have to tell us.

45:49.000 --> 45:49.833
Violet.

45:52.500 --> 45:53.708
Shall I go with you?

45:54.292 --> 45:55.250
I'll be fine.

45:55.917 --> 46:01.958
You may eliminate your pity, concern,
and overprotectiveness of me.

46:17.417 --> 46:21.458
-She said she'll be fine.
-Shut up! Just be quiet and eat!

46:22.958 --> 46:25.125
Violet's right.

46:25.208 --> 46:27.625
You can't worry about her all the time.

46:28.208 --> 46:30.333
Of course I'm worried.

46:30.417 --> 46:32.667
Dietfried, that bastard.

46:32.750 --> 46:35.375
He's playing on Violet's broken heart.

46:35.958 --> 46:39.292
He could be good for Violet.

46:39.917 --> 46:42.583
They can share
their memories of the major.

46:42.667 --> 46:45.625
That man took advantage
of Violet being an orphan

46:45.708 --> 46:48.333
and used her as a tool during the war.

46:50.333 --> 46:52.875
Is that why he shouldn't talk to her?

46:52.958 --> 46:55.042
Even if he's not like that anymore?

46:58.042 --> 47:01.375
Are you saying they should lick
each other's wounds?

47:01.458 --> 47:03.625
Would that be such a bad thing?

47:04.250 --> 47:07.750
Violet still has feelings for the major.

47:08.542 --> 47:13.250
I'm worried she's going to be crushed
by those feelings unless we do something.

47:14.167 --> 47:15.292
The captain may…

47:16.542 --> 47:19.083
bring comfort to her
in a way that we can't.

47:23.375 --> 47:24.208
You know…

47:25.083 --> 47:28.042
if I ever have kids someday,

47:28.125 --> 47:29.750
I hope it's a boy.

47:30.542 --> 47:33.000
My nerves won't be able to handle a girl!

47:50.167 --> 47:53.083
This is one of the books
he was crazy about.

47:54.667 --> 47:56.833
He played many games with our father.

48:00.542 --> 48:02.625
Did this belong to the major?

48:03.292 --> 48:04.125
No.

48:04.208 --> 48:05.208
That's mine.

48:08.792 --> 48:09.958
Excuse me.

48:12.000 --> 48:13.708
You don't have to be so formal.

48:14.292 --> 48:15.125
Yes.

48:17.583 --> 48:19.958
You and the major must have sailed…

48:20.708 --> 48:23.125
this ship often when you were children.

48:24.250 --> 48:25.417
Yeah.

48:25.500 --> 48:26.958
Our father took us out.

48:27.792 --> 48:30.917
My father was devoted to the military,

48:31.000 --> 48:33.167
but he liked sailing as well.

48:35.417 --> 48:37.917
That's the only thing
I inherited from him.

49:01.875 --> 49:03.583
This is our family's flower.

49:19.250 --> 49:20.667
What does it matter?

49:23.667 --> 49:24.500
What?

49:25.125 --> 49:26.583
What did you just say?

49:28.250 --> 49:30.833
That's what you wanted to show us, right?

49:32.542 --> 49:36.583
You wanted to show us this,
so you could tell us to become like you.

49:37.375 --> 49:38.208
Brother.

49:39.625 --> 49:41.833
You just wanted to show us…

49:42.708 --> 49:44.333
that this is our only choice!

49:44.417 --> 49:45.458
Brother!

49:46.042 --> 49:50.708
You, your father, and all of us
in the Bougainvillea family

49:50.792 --> 49:53.125
have no choice but to join the military!

49:58.125 --> 49:59.833
Father, stop!

49:59.917 --> 50:01.583
Don't hit Brother!

50:03.917 --> 50:05.125
I'll do it!

50:05.875 --> 50:07.875
I'll grow up to be like you!

50:10.458 --> 50:12.625
Since I was so rebellious…

50:13.792 --> 50:17.083
Gil had no choice
but to listen to our father.

50:19.208 --> 50:22.417
It's my fault.
He couldn't choose his own life.

50:23.292 --> 50:27.042
But I still treated him horribly.

50:28.458 --> 50:31.792
I have… no siblings in my family,

50:31.875 --> 50:33.750
so I don't entirely understand.

50:35.875 --> 50:37.542
However, I can understand…

50:38.667 --> 50:40.208
how someone could…

50:41.083 --> 50:42.625
have complicated feelings…

50:43.792 --> 50:45.750
for someone they're close to.

50:47.250 --> 50:50.208
You understand how other people feel?

50:52.042 --> 50:54.167
Sorry, I wasn't trying to be sarcastic.

50:55.292 --> 50:56.292
I know.

51:01.458 --> 51:04.875
Is it okay if I keep the book
and this board game?

51:07.417 --> 51:08.250
Yes.

51:15.958 --> 51:16.875
Let's go now.

51:29.750 --> 51:30.750
Are you okay?

51:35.000 --> 51:36.250
Thank you.

51:39.167 --> 51:41.250
We've both lost something important.

51:42.000 --> 51:43.000
Both you…

51:43.625 --> 51:44.458
and I.

51:47.458 --> 51:48.917
Sorry about the other day.

51:50.208 --> 51:54.792
For saying you'll never see him again,
and telling you to forget him.

51:55.958 --> 51:58.125
I can't forget him either.

51:59.917 --> 52:01.167
After all…

52:02.000 --> 52:04.208
he's my little brother.

52:07.333 --> 52:08.167
Yes.

52:11.333 --> 52:14.833
If I could see him again…
I would apologize for many things.

52:15.625 --> 52:18.167
And many things I would talk to him about.

52:20.625 --> 52:21.458
Yes.

52:27.208 --> 52:29.208
Next, the letter for my brother.

52:29.292 --> 52:33.417
I wonder what
I should write to him, though.

52:33.500 --> 52:35.375
Sion's still only five.

52:36.167 --> 52:40.042
Why don't you tell him how you felt

52:40.125 --> 52:41.667
when he was born?

52:41.750 --> 52:42.667
Yeah.

52:44.250 --> 52:46.208
I was so happy when he was born.

52:47.958 --> 52:51.833
He was so warm and soft,
like a freshly baked loaf of bread.

52:55.333 --> 52:56.167
But then…

52:57.708 --> 53:01.708
Did you start to feel like
he stole your parents from you?

53:06.083 --> 53:09.917
Did you feel jealous when your parents
praised him instead of you?

53:10.958 --> 53:11.792
You're right.

53:12.792 --> 53:16.417
But you thought he was adorable
whenever he chased you.

53:19.333 --> 53:20.917
How did you know that?

53:24.083 --> 53:26.292
I've heard other people talk about it.

53:32.042 --> 53:34.583
Okay. After you write that, add this next:

53:36.042 --> 53:38.000
"Live a full life in my place.

53:38.958 --> 53:42.792
And in my place
be good to Mom and Dad.

53:46.833 --> 53:47.875
Have Mom and Dad…

53:49.333 --> 53:51.833
spoil you in my place."

53:55.958 --> 53:59.625
To me, it seems like
you're saying things you don't mean.

54:00.417 --> 54:04.333
What you really want
is for your father and mother

54:04.417 --> 54:05.750
to spoil you yourself.

54:09.708 --> 54:10.917
You know everything.

54:12.875 --> 54:15.000
I've written a lot of letters.

54:17.792 --> 54:22.083
Words, attitudes, and feelings
all have an outside and an inside.

54:23.792 --> 54:26.958
I've begun to understand
that what you see…

54:27.917 --> 54:29.833
on the surface isn't everything.

54:31.292 --> 54:33.542
And sometimes you have to tell people…

54:35.042 --> 54:38.375
your true feelings, or they'll never know.

54:45.167 --> 54:46.000
Look.

54:46.083 --> 54:47.417
How is this?

54:51.708 --> 54:52.875
Thank you.

55:05.667 --> 55:10.792
I'll hold on to the three letters
and keep them safe.

55:14.875 --> 55:19.250
Give them the letters
on the day I go to heaven.

55:20.750 --> 55:24.292
I'll ask the hospital
to inform the post office.

55:26.917 --> 55:27.750
Yes.

55:30.083 --> 55:32.000
Hey, can you do a pinky swear?

55:33.542 --> 55:34.708
A pinky swear?

55:34.792 --> 55:35.708
Yeah.

55:35.792 --> 55:37.125
You link pinkies…

55:38.250 --> 55:39.167
with each other.

55:39.708 --> 55:40.708
And you swear…

55:41.333 --> 55:43.875
to keep your promise.

55:52.125 --> 55:53.000
Thank you.

56:00.750 --> 56:02.167
Your finger is so cold.

56:04.542 --> 56:06.167
Even through my glove.

56:09.750 --> 56:13.042
I'll probably go cold
before the winter comes.

56:17.792 --> 56:18.625
Still.

56:20.583 --> 56:22.500
I think your letters will warm…

56:24.000 --> 56:27.542
the hearts of your parents and brother.

56:30.542 --> 56:33.292
I'll make sure I give them your letters.

56:44.708 --> 56:47.292
Well, then, I've fulfilled my duties.

57:00.333 --> 57:01.167
Wait!

57:04.292 --> 57:05.458
There's one more…

57:06.375 --> 57:07.750
letter I want to write.

57:09.958 --> 57:11.333
Is it for Lucas?

57:13.208 --> 57:15.292
I was listening from under the bed.

57:21.083 --> 57:25.500
If there's something you want to tell him,
it's best to do it while you can.

57:26.708 --> 57:27.583
You think so?

57:28.250 --> 57:29.083
Yes.

57:30.167 --> 57:31.000
I was…

57:31.500 --> 57:35.083
unable to ask and say everything I wanted.

57:37.500 --> 57:38.333
To whom?

57:39.583 --> 57:40.417
The person…

57:40.917 --> 57:42.833
who gave me "I love you."

57:44.250 --> 57:46.417
Did that person die?

57:48.375 --> 57:49.208
I believe…

57:49.875 --> 57:52.083
that he's still alive somewhere.

57:55.250 --> 57:57.708
What did you want to tell him?

58:00.667 --> 58:01.667
That I understand…

58:03.125 --> 58:04.833
what "I love you" means.

58:04.917 --> 58:06.583
You understand? Is that all?

58:21.542 --> 58:23.583
Lucas said…

58:25.500 --> 58:27.125
he wanted to visit me.

58:28.542 --> 58:29.875
But I told him not to.

58:31.958 --> 58:35.083
Lucas and I have been close
since we were little kids.

58:36.125 --> 58:37.917
We always played together.

58:39.333 --> 58:40.167
But then…

58:41.042 --> 58:42.000
my arms and legs…

58:42.792 --> 58:43.750
began…

58:45.083 --> 58:46.250
to wither.

58:47.375 --> 58:48.375
I don't want him…

58:49.000 --> 58:50.500
to see me like this.

58:53.042 --> 58:54.125
I'll put…

58:54.208 --> 58:55.292
those feelings…

58:55.958 --> 58:57.292
in the letter for you.

58:58.542 --> 58:59.667
As for the fee…

59:10.792 --> 59:11.750
Yuris!

59:15.000 --> 59:16.167
I'll get the nurse!

59:16.750 --> 59:19.583
Let's leave the letter
to Lucas for next time.

59:22.708 --> 59:23.708
Sorry.

59:26.417 --> 59:27.292
No problem.

1:00:15.167 --> 1:00:17.375
Are these all the "lost letters"?

1:00:18.792 --> 1:00:21.083
I took them from Roland.

1:00:22.167 --> 1:00:25.375
I thought I'd return the letters
whose senders we know.

1:00:26.583 --> 1:00:29.958
So? Are you asking me
to help you since I'm the president?

1:00:30.708 --> 1:00:33.917
Young people these days
don't like working overtime.

1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:37.792
Look how hard I'm working.
You should make me the vice president.

1:00:40.875 --> 1:00:43.417
You should go to accounting school first.

1:00:44.958 --> 1:00:48.000
Our vice president
must understand the account books.

1:00:48.083 --> 1:00:51.125
Whoa! Now, I know how to get promoted!

1:00:51.917 --> 1:00:53.833
Then I might get serious.

1:00:57.083 --> 1:00:57.917
Isn't this…

1:01:00.417 --> 1:01:01.542
Yeah.

1:01:01.625 --> 1:01:04.875
This is the shelf
where we keep recent mail.

1:01:07.708 --> 1:01:09.000
This handwriting…

1:01:09.833 --> 1:01:10.667
What's wrong?

1:01:11.583 --> 1:01:12.417
No.

1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:17.333
The sender's address
is on the Island of Ecarte.

1:01:17.417 --> 1:01:21.792
That island
used to be occupied by Gardarik.

1:01:22.667 --> 1:01:24.958
It gained independence after the war.

1:01:29.625 --> 1:01:31.583
Why did you want to meet with me?

1:01:31.667 --> 1:01:33.292
President.

1:01:35.917 --> 1:01:36.750
The other day…

1:01:36.833 --> 1:01:39.500
Is it about that doll
who works at your place?

1:01:41.250 --> 1:01:42.625
Did she say something?

1:01:44.208 --> 1:01:45.042
No.

1:01:45.792 --> 1:01:46.708
Don't worry.

1:01:47.625 --> 1:01:49.458
She left after she visited the boat.

1:01:49.542 --> 1:01:52.292
She said that you'd be worried about her.

1:01:54.625 --> 1:01:57.542
She said she'd tell me before she went.

1:01:58.875 --> 1:02:00.875
You're not her guardian.

1:02:02.875 --> 1:02:04.917
You have no right to control her.

1:02:11.417 --> 1:02:13.792
You bastard! How dare you say that!

1:02:19.875 --> 1:02:20.875
Sorry.

1:02:22.083 --> 1:02:23.125
I was wrong.

1:02:27.667 --> 1:02:31.208
This is the only way I know how to talk.

1:02:32.250 --> 1:02:35.292
I didn't come today talk about Violet.

1:02:42.917 --> 1:02:44.167
Isn't this…

1:02:44.792 --> 1:02:46.083
Can you look into it?

1:03:00.125 --> 1:03:01.042
President.

1:03:02.042 --> 1:03:03.750
Sorry to disturb you so late.

1:03:04.625 --> 1:03:06.875
I need to talk to you about something.

1:03:15.375 --> 1:03:16.250
What is it?

1:03:18.833 --> 1:03:21.750
I… haven't confirmed it yet.

1:03:23.750 --> 1:03:24.667
But…

1:03:25.792 --> 1:03:27.250
it's possible I'm wrong.

1:03:35.875 --> 1:03:36.792
The major?

1:03:36.875 --> 1:03:38.625
Is it the major?

1:03:42.250 --> 1:03:43.083
Yeah.

1:03:49.792 --> 1:03:51.083
Have you news of him?

1:03:53.542 --> 1:03:55.458
Have you received new information…

1:03:56.250 --> 1:03:57.625
about Major Gilbert?

1:04:31.375 --> 1:04:32.792
Are you going to go now?

1:04:33.333 --> 1:04:34.333
Yeah.

1:04:34.417 --> 1:04:36.792
It might be someone else, but I'm going.

1:04:37.667 --> 1:04:40.875
All right! We'll take care of things here!

1:04:43.333 --> 1:04:45.458
Violet… Are you okay?

1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:49.125
Am I okay?

1:04:50.750 --> 1:04:53.333
Is it okay if I see the major?

1:04:54.125 --> 1:04:56.625
Is there anything wrong with me?

1:04:57.417 --> 1:04:59.375
It's been so many years.

1:05:00.375 --> 1:05:03.000
Do you think the major will recognize me?

1:05:03.083 --> 1:05:04.000
Come on.

1:05:04.625 --> 1:05:05.792
Violet.

1:05:05.875 --> 1:05:09.667
What should I say when I see him?

1:05:09.750 --> 1:05:11.208
Tell him how I'm doing now?

1:05:11.958 --> 1:05:14.500
Or tell him my feelings?

1:05:14.583 --> 1:05:17.125
Will I be able to articulate it?

1:05:19.542 --> 1:05:20.875
Am I being foolish?

1:05:24.250 --> 1:05:25.083
Violet.

1:05:30.583 --> 1:05:32.917
It's going to be a long journey, right?

1:05:33.750 --> 1:05:36.125
Why not write a letter on the way there?

1:05:48.292 --> 1:05:50.125
We're back, Daisy.

1:05:50.208 --> 1:05:52.083
Sorry for being so late.

1:05:54.625 --> 1:05:55.542
Daisy?

1:06:12.667 --> 1:06:16.792
"I am going to Leiden for a while."

1:06:45.125 --> 1:06:47.542
<i>The country eventually nationalized…</i>

1:06:48.375 --> 1:06:51.125
<i>all the postal companies.</i>

1:06:51.208 --> 1:06:54.667
<i>The one she worked for</i>
<i>was turned into a museum.</i>

1:07:12.833 --> 1:07:17.417
<i>I wonder where she went after she quit.</i>

1:07:17.500 --> 1:07:20.042
Please take your time looking around.

1:07:21.250 --> 1:07:23.542
I'm sorry. I didn't notice you there.

1:07:24.292 --> 1:07:25.583
No problem.

1:07:25.667 --> 1:07:30.792
If you have any questions, please ask me.

1:07:31.458 --> 1:07:32.542
Okay.

1:07:36.667 --> 1:07:42.292
Actually, I used to work here
a long time ago as a receptionist.

1:07:43.583 --> 1:07:44.792
Oh, really?

1:07:47.667 --> 1:07:48.667
Yes.

1:08:05.792 --> 1:08:06.625
Excuse me.

1:08:07.583 --> 1:08:08.875
What's this stamp?

1:08:11.750 --> 1:08:13.292
Oh, yes.

1:08:14.167 --> 1:08:19.542
This stamp is only issued
on the island of Ecarte.

1:08:24.958 --> 1:08:26.375
The island of Ecarte?

1:08:31.917 --> 1:08:35.458
Did you say you used to work here?

1:08:36.167 --> 1:08:37.000
Yes.

1:08:41.667 --> 1:08:43.542
<i>Oh, sea of blessing</i>

1:08:44.542 --> 1:08:46.958
<i>Sea that connects to the entire world</i>

1:08:48.500 --> 1:08:51.333
<i>The seagulls dance, in your skies</i>

1:08:52.625 --> 1:08:56.167
<i>The fish swim, in your midst</i>

1:08:57.958 --> 1:09:02.375
<i>The shellfish burrow, in your bottom</i>

1:09:02.458 --> 1:09:04.417
<i>You give light</i>

1:09:06.750 --> 1:09:08.667
<i>You nurture life</i>

1:09:10.208 --> 1:09:12.167
<i>You pour out love</i>

1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:16.000
<i>We continue to live close to you</i>

1:09:19.167 --> 1:09:20.083
<i>Until we cease</i>

1:09:23.042 --> 1:09:26.167
<i>We entrust our bodies to you</i>

1:09:26.750 --> 1:09:28.667
<i>In the present</i>
<i>In the past</i>

1:09:28.750 --> 1:09:29.750
<i>And in the future</i>

1:09:59.125 --> 1:10:03.333
It's supposed to be a ritual
for giving thanks to the sea.

1:10:04.917 --> 1:10:09.917
But it's become a day
to mourn those who didn't return.

1:10:13.667 --> 1:10:16.417
No one returned from the war.

1:10:17.167 --> 1:10:20.375
The only people left on the island

1:10:20.458 --> 1:10:23.833
are the old, the women, and the children.

1:10:25.542 --> 1:10:28.667
They died at war instead of at sea.

1:10:29.792 --> 1:10:32.708
I must apologize to our ancestors.

1:10:33.333 --> 1:10:37.625
Our fathers were killed
by those Leiden soldiers, right?

1:10:38.958 --> 1:10:39.833
Yes.

1:10:40.625 --> 1:10:43.708
I wish everyone in Leiden would die!

1:10:45.375 --> 1:10:47.250
The hymn they just read

1:10:47.333 --> 1:10:51.125
was dedicated at the Festival
of Thanksgiving in Leiden.

1:10:52.000 --> 1:10:54.708
They say it was written by a famous doll.

1:10:56.875 --> 1:11:00.208
Violet Evergarden was her name.

1:11:03.458 --> 1:11:04.292
Everyone!

1:11:05.208 --> 1:11:07.000
Come! It's time to eat!

1:11:11.875 --> 1:11:13.375
Come on. Let's go!

1:11:24.583 --> 1:11:25.625
Let's go!

1:11:28.208 --> 1:11:29.042
Teacher!

1:11:29.667 --> 1:11:30.833
I love you!

1:11:33.708 --> 1:11:34.583
Let's go!

1:11:35.542 --> 1:11:36.417
Come on!

1:11:46.292 --> 1:11:47.250
<i>Major.</i>

1:11:47.958 --> 1:11:49.958
<i>It's been such a long time.</i>

1:11:50.708 --> 1:11:52.167
<i>I've thought about you…</i>

1:11:53.000 --> 1:11:54.375
<i>every single day,</i>

1:11:54.458 --> 1:11:57.708
<i>every single day while I couldn't see you.</i>

1:11:59.417 --> 1:12:02.750
<i>I hope that my prayers will be answered…</i>

1:12:03.458 --> 1:12:05.167
<i>that my wish will be granted…</i>

1:12:06.333 --> 1:12:08.000
<i>and that I can see you again…</i>

1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:09.875
<i>someday.</i>

1:13:18.208 --> 1:13:19.750
Violet.

1:13:20.458 --> 1:13:23.292
Can you wait here for a while?

1:13:24.708 --> 1:13:25.667
I'm going too!

1:13:28.417 --> 1:13:29.250
If…

1:13:29.708 --> 1:13:31.042
Gilbert really is…

1:13:31.542 --> 1:13:32.833
here now…

1:13:34.167 --> 1:13:37.125
We don't know his current situation.

1:13:38.250 --> 1:13:40.000
-So--
-I don't care!

1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:45.000
You may not care.

1:13:47.750 --> 1:13:49.125
I don't know about him.

1:13:51.083 --> 1:13:54.000
I heard he's not using his real name here.

1:13:55.208 --> 1:13:56.625
It's a small island.

1:13:57.375 --> 1:13:59.750
He likely doesn't want to spread rumors.

1:14:04.083 --> 1:14:05.500
Can you wait here?

1:14:08.375 --> 1:14:09.208
I'll wait.

1:14:10.917 --> 1:14:12.833
If I can see him again,

1:14:13.500 --> 1:14:15.208
I'll wait as long as it takes.

1:14:21.375 --> 1:14:25.583
It's your first time here.
Why don't you take a look around?

1:14:31.667 --> 1:14:32.667
Understood.

1:15:39.542 --> 1:15:41.125
I don't know who he is.

1:15:44.917 --> 1:15:45.833
Hello!

1:15:49.667 --> 1:15:50.625
Hello.

1:15:51.292 --> 1:15:54.292
-Whose father are you?
-I'm not…

1:15:54.375 --> 1:15:57.083
-Then who are you?
-You look creepy.

1:15:57.167 --> 1:16:00.292
No. I'm from the postal company.

1:16:00.375 --> 1:16:03.042
Oh! Then are you here to deliver a letter?

1:16:05.000 --> 1:16:06.042
Yes.

1:16:06.125 --> 1:16:08.542
Look! I've got something for you!

1:16:12.250 --> 1:16:13.500
He's scared!

1:16:14.208 --> 1:16:15.083
Let's go back!

1:16:19.208 --> 1:16:21.792
I don't think I can handle a boy either.

1:16:28.000 --> 1:16:29.500
Are you someone's sister?

1:16:34.167 --> 1:16:36.417
-I'm--
-Are you a post-person?

1:16:38.125 --> 1:16:39.792
Yes. That's right.

1:16:39.875 --> 1:16:41.000
I knew it!

1:16:42.125 --> 1:16:43.083
This is for you!

1:16:44.125 --> 1:16:45.000
Here!

1:16:46.333 --> 1:16:47.167
An insect.

1:16:48.375 --> 1:16:49.333
A praying mantis.

1:16:50.000 --> 1:16:51.500
Aren't you scared?

1:16:52.917 --> 1:16:53.750
It's missing…

1:16:55.000 --> 1:16:56.333
one of its front legs.

1:16:57.500 --> 1:16:59.333
Just like Teacher Gilbert.

1:17:02.542 --> 1:17:03.708
Is he also missing…

1:17:06.375 --> 1:17:07.250
his right eye?

1:17:07.917 --> 1:17:09.125
You know a lot!

1:17:10.375 --> 1:17:11.708
He's your teacher?

1:17:12.708 --> 1:17:14.417
He's your teacher, right?

1:17:15.542 --> 1:17:16.375
That's right.

1:17:21.500 --> 1:17:22.458
Is your teacher…

1:17:26.125 --> 1:17:27.125
doing well?

1:17:28.417 --> 1:17:32.625
Yeah! He has no right hand
but plays the bars with his left.

1:17:32.708 --> 1:17:36.500
-And he can run really fast!
-Yeah! He's really fast!

1:17:36.583 --> 1:17:37.542
Right?

1:17:46.542 --> 1:17:47.375
Can you…

1:17:48.292 --> 1:17:50.333
please tell me more about him?

1:17:51.333 --> 1:17:52.667
About your teacher?

1:17:52.750 --> 1:17:53.583
Okay!

1:17:54.333 --> 1:17:57.625
Our teacher… he's really nice!

1:17:57.708 --> 1:18:01.042
He explains things over and over
if you don't understand!

1:18:48.417 --> 1:18:49.375
Who is it?

1:18:58.875 --> 1:18:59.792
Come in.

1:19:14.667 --> 1:19:17.167
If there's something you don't understand…

1:19:19.917 --> 1:19:21.417
I never thought that…

1:19:24.500 --> 1:19:25.542
You survived.

1:19:26.958 --> 1:19:27.792
Gilbert.

1:19:32.167 --> 1:19:35.083
I go by the name "Jilbert" here.

1:19:36.250 --> 1:19:37.083
I see.

1:19:39.250 --> 1:19:41.375
Sorry for visiting you so suddenly.

1:19:42.458 --> 1:19:43.667
How did you find me?

1:19:45.000 --> 1:19:47.125
You wrote a letter for a kid, right?

1:19:50.000 --> 1:19:53.625
All the undeliverable letters
get returned to the post office.

1:19:54.583 --> 1:19:58.833
We check them a final time
before returning them to the sender.

1:20:00.417 --> 1:20:02.833
I came across your letter by chance.

1:20:05.833 --> 1:20:06.667
Why…

1:20:07.917 --> 1:20:08.917
are you here?

1:20:15.917 --> 1:20:17.208
<i>After the battle…</i>

1:20:19.125 --> 1:20:21.917
<i>I awoke lying in a hospital bed.</i>

1:20:23.333 --> 1:20:27.958
<i>I didn't have my ID tags, so they sent me</i>
<i>to a hospital run by a monastery.</i>

1:20:33.583 --> 1:20:36.208
<i>I worked at the hospital for a while.</i>

1:20:47.208 --> 1:20:50.625
<i>Then instead of returning home,</i>
<i>I roamed around for a time.</i>

1:20:53.667 --> 1:20:54.500
<i>I came here…</i>

1:20:55.583 --> 1:20:56.417
<i>a year ago.</i>

1:20:59.250 --> 1:21:04.208
I wrote letters at the children's request,
and started teaching<i> </i>at this school.

1:21:05.750 --> 1:21:08.292
I know my duty was to notify the military.

1:21:09.375 --> 1:21:10.750
That doesn't matter.

1:21:12.292 --> 1:21:15.208
Did you know that Violet is alive?

1:21:18.792 --> 1:21:19.625
Yeah.

1:21:20.333 --> 1:21:23.833
Then why didn't you come see her!

1:21:23.917 --> 1:21:25.208
Violet!

1:21:28.708 --> 1:21:30.708
She's been waiting this whole time!

1:21:30.792 --> 1:21:33.417
I made her unhappy!

1:21:36.042 --> 1:21:36.875
She's…

1:21:38.208 --> 1:21:40.292
better off without me.

1:21:44.750 --> 1:21:45.625
She's here…

1:21:46.667 --> 1:21:47.500
as well.

1:21:50.875 --> 1:21:53.000
She's waiting outside right now.

1:21:55.125 --> 1:21:58.125
Do you have any idea how much
she wanted to see you?

1:22:03.833 --> 1:22:04.833
I can't see her.

1:22:05.583 --> 1:22:06.583
Gilbert.

1:22:07.208 --> 1:22:08.167
I can't see her.

1:22:09.167 --> 1:22:10.333
Never again.

1:22:13.167 --> 1:22:14.000
My friend…

1:22:14.083 --> 1:22:15.167
He's dead.

1:22:16.792 --> 1:22:19.125
Gilbert Bougainvillea is dead.

1:22:20.167 --> 1:22:21.875
That's what everyone thought.

1:22:22.542 --> 1:22:26.333
And as the years went by,
everyone accepted it.

1:22:27.500 --> 1:22:30.625
Therefore… let me live a different life.

1:22:31.875 --> 1:22:33.125
-Gilbert--
-We're…

1:22:34.167 --> 1:22:36.708
in the middle
of the grape harvest season.

1:22:37.875 --> 1:22:39.708
I'm going to help them.

1:22:40.917 --> 1:22:43.917
All the men on this island left for war.

1:22:45.625 --> 1:22:47.333
And none of them returned.

1:22:49.125 --> 1:22:49.958
Hodgins.

1:22:50.583 --> 1:22:51.417
Please.

1:22:52.375 --> 1:22:53.208
Leave.

1:23:00.917 --> 1:23:01.750
I'll return.

1:23:03.125 --> 1:23:04.083
I'll come back.

1:23:27.958 --> 1:23:28.833
Do you…

1:23:30.875 --> 1:23:32.583
Do you hate me?

1:23:35.667 --> 1:23:37.625
I don't understand your question.

1:23:38.292 --> 1:23:40.417
Have I failed you in some way?

1:23:41.583 --> 1:23:45.500
If there's something I'm doing wrong,
I'll fix it! Please tell me!

1:23:47.208 --> 1:23:48.042
No.

1:23:49.125 --> 1:23:50.083
That's not true.

1:23:51.750 --> 1:23:54.125
It's my fault. I said you're not a tool.

1:23:55.208 --> 1:23:56.042
But I still…

1:23:56.792 --> 1:23:59.333
I still… used you.

1:24:00.000 --> 1:24:03.292
Of course you can use me! I'm your weapon!

1:24:04.417 --> 1:24:06.958
The battle is turning against us!

1:24:07.042 --> 1:24:08.417
What should I do next?

1:24:09.292 --> 1:24:11.500
Major! Give me your orders!

1:24:30.583 --> 1:24:31.667
President!

1:24:42.417 --> 1:24:43.917
It's him!

1:24:44.000 --> 1:24:45.875
It's really him!

1:24:46.500 --> 1:24:48.375
I talked to the children.

1:24:53.625 --> 1:24:56.708
Did you not see him?

1:24:57.750 --> 1:24:58.583
I did.

1:25:01.000 --> 1:25:04.458
Was he hurt anywhere
besides his arm and eye?

1:25:05.917 --> 1:25:06.875
No.

1:25:06.958 --> 1:25:07.792
Then…

1:25:08.542 --> 1:25:10.250
I can see him, right!

1:25:14.375 --> 1:25:15.500
He said…

1:25:16.375 --> 1:25:17.500
he can't see you.

1:25:23.292 --> 1:25:25.917
Is he still working?

1:25:27.292 --> 1:25:29.542
I'll wait until he's finished.

1:25:29.625 --> 1:25:30.833
That's not it.

1:25:31.500 --> 1:25:34.625
-Then I'll wait until nighttime.
-Violet!

1:25:37.000 --> 1:25:37.833
Then…

1:25:38.542 --> 1:25:39.750
then tomorrow.

1:25:43.458 --> 1:25:44.292
Right.

1:25:45.792 --> 1:25:48.792
I'll go see him tomorrow
and try to talk to him.

1:25:50.625 --> 1:25:51.500
He must…

1:25:52.000 --> 1:25:54.000
he has to see you.

1:25:57.375 --> 1:25:58.208
Does…

1:25:59.125 --> 1:26:00.708
that mean…

1:26:00.792 --> 1:26:02.458
not that he can't see me?

1:26:03.792 --> 1:26:05.500
But that he doesn't…

1:26:06.042 --> 1:26:07.250
want to see me?

1:26:11.000 --> 1:26:11.917
Why not?

1:26:14.583 --> 1:26:16.125
I can't really explain it.

1:26:17.500 --> 1:26:19.917
He said it's better that way for you both.

1:26:21.167 --> 1:26:22.167
It can't be.

1:26:23.667 --> 1:26:24.500
I…

1:26:25.250 --> 1:26:26.083
I…

1:26:27.667 --> 1:26:28.583
Violet.

1:26:31.042 --> 1:26:31.875
Violet!

1:26:47.000 --> 1:26:51.417
Once you're done, it'll be easy
to move the grapes to the top.

1:26:53.333 --> 1:26:56.000
You've been a big help.

1:27:05.542 --> 1:27:08.500
It looks like we'll have heavy rain.

1:27:09.333 --> 1:27:10.167
Major!

1:27:17.083 --> 1:27:17.917
Major!

1:27:35.042 --> 1:27:35.875
I found him.

1:28:05.042 --> 1:28:05.875
Major.

1:28:10.083 --> 1:28:10.917
Major.

1:28:14.458 --> 1:28:15.292
Major!

1:28:16.000 --> 1:28:16.917
Major!

1:28:17.667 --> 1:28:18.583
Major!

1:28:38.125 --> 1:28:39.458
I'm sorry I came…

1:28:40.667 --> 1:28:41.708
to your house.

1:28:43.958 --> 1:28:44.792
Major.

1:28:45.792 --> 1:28:47.458
If you've been alive…

1:28:47.542 --> 1:28:49.833
why haven't you contacted me<i>?</i>

1:28:51.167 --> 1:28:53.167
Why didn't you come to see me?

1:28:56.792 --> 1:28:57.625
I want to…

1:28:58.250 --> 1:28:59.750
Major, I want to see you.

1:29:00.833 --> 1:29:03.458
I want to continue talking
where we left off.

1:29:05.208 --> 1:29:06.708
I've begun to understand…

1:29:08.375 --> 1:29:10.625
the meaning of "I love you."

1:29:15.417 --> 1:29:16.500
Go away.

1:29:20.583 --> 1:29:21.542
Go away!

1:29:35.917 --> 1:29:36.750
I'll wait.

1:29:37.583 --> 1:29:39.042
I'll wait here…

1:29:41.375 --> 1:29:42.667
until I can see you.

1:29:45.000 --> 1:29:45.958
You don't…

1:29:46.583 --> 1:29:48.083
need me now.

1:29:50.417 --> 1:29:51.458
And…

1:29:52.375 --> 1:29:53.292
if I'm with you…

1:29:53.833 --> 1:29:55.208
I will remember…

1:29:57.208 --> 1:30:00.292
taking you to the battlefield
when you were so young…

1:30:01.958 --> 1:30:02.792
how you…

1:30:04.583 --> 1:30:06.625
lost both of your arms…

1:30:08.417 --> 1:30:10.167
because of my orders.

1:30:24.000 --> 1:30:24.875
Major.

1:30:26.083 --> 1:30:27.750
Do you regret…

1:30:30.708 --> 1:30:32.083
that I exist?

1:30:34.208 --> 1:30:35.042
It must be…

1:30:35.750 --> 1:30:36.583
that I am…

1:30:39.083 --> 1:30:40.458
causing you pain.

1:30:44.583 --> 1:30:45.708
I can understand…

1:30:46.917 --> 1:30:49.125
how you must feel now, Major.

1:30:50.833 --> 1:30:52.708
I don't understand everything.

1:30:54.792 --> 1:30:55.792
But I understand…

1:30:56.792 --> 1:30:57.667
a little.

1:31:22.583 --> 1:31:27.375
You idiot!

1:32:47.000 --> 1:32:48.667
You can have these.

1:32:50.000 --> 1:32:51.292
We are grateful.

1:32:52.500 --> 1:32:55.375
There was nowhere else for us to stay.

1:32:55.458 --> 1:32:58.625
It's a small island.
We don't even have an inn.

1:32:59.750 --> 1:33:04.625
Violet said this lighthouse
functions as a post office as well.

1:33:12.958 --> 1:33:14.042
<i>I see…</i>

1:33:15.000 --> 1:33:18.208
<i>how the season has come again</i>
<i>with the bloom of this flower.</i>

1:33:27.875 --> 1:33:31.250
"The prince's eyes
were like blue sapphires.

1:33:31.333 --> 1:33:35.125
The sword at his side was decorated
with sparkling red rubies."

1:33:41.042 --> 1:33:43.375
You've gotten pretty good at reading.

1:33:44.917 --> 1:33:45.792
Violet.

1:33:53.167 --> 1:33:54.542
Stay by my side.

1:33:55.500 --> 1:33:58.375
Stay by my side at all times, Violet.

1:34:01.708 --> 1:34:02.833
Okay.

1:34:18.917 --> 1:34:21.458
Are you from the Leiden postal company?

1:34:22.875 --> 1:34:23.958
Yes.

1:34:25.542 --> 1:34:28.667
Is Violet Evergarden the girl

1:34:28.750 --> 1:34:30.667
who was with you just now?

1:34:34.292 --> 1:34:37.500
Your postal company
got a call from the hospital.

1:34:39.292 --> 1:34:42.292
There's a boy named Yuris
who is in critical condition.

1:34:43.083 --> 1:34:44.167
Yuris?

1:34:45.042 --> 1:34:46.708
-Who's that?
-He's one of my…

1:34:49.375 --> 1:34:50.292
customers.

1:34:56.000 --> 1:34:59.917
Give them the letters
on the day I go to heaven.

1:35:01.167 --> 1:35:02.000
Yes.

1:35:23.333 --> 1:35:24.250
I'm going back.

1:35:26.167 --> 1:35:27.917
I'm going back to Leiden.

1:35:28.500 --> 1:35:29.417
Violet!

1:35:30.250 --> 1:35:33.042
You can't go back
in the middle of a storm!

1:35:33.792 --> 1:35:37.167
The boats can only leave
tomorrow morning at the earliest.

1:35:39.542 --> 1:35:40.708
You'll see Gilbert.

1:35:43.125 --> 1:35:43.958
Right?

1:35:49.958 --> 1:35:51.042
I want to see him.

1:35:53.875 --> 1:35:55.250
I want to see him!

1:35:56.875 --> 1:35:57.708
But!

1:35:59.542 --> 1:36:00.958
I made a pinky promise!

1:36:03.375 --> 1:36:04.333
Yuris.

1:36:05.250 --> 1:36:06.542
I promised him.

1:36:09.917 --> 1:36:14.583
And there's still one letter
I haven't written yet.

1:36:19.500 --> 1:36:22.917
But it's going to take you
at least three days to get back.

1:36:40.667 --> 1:36:43.875
-Can't you go faster!
-I'm going as fast as I can!

1:36:53.833 --> 1:36:59.000
Benedict and Iris left for the hospital
to deliver the letters you were keeping.

1:37:00.375 --> 1:37:01.208
Good.

1:37:17.292 --> 1:37:18.208
Excuse me.

1:37:31.042 --> 1:37:31.875
Yuris.

1:37:32.958 --> 1:37:34.667
The doll is here.

1:37:37.333 --> 1:37:39.583
You want her to write a letter, right?

1:37:44.333 --> 1:37:46.375
Vio… let?

1:37:48.042 --> 1:37:49.708
I'm Iris. I came instead.

1:37:50.750 --> 1:37:53.083
Violet is somewhere far away right now.

1:37:54.125 --> 1:37:56.958
She is reuniting
with the one who's dear to her.

1:37:59.458 --> 1:38:00.458
Is it the person…

1:38:01.583 --> 1:38:03.250
who taught her "I love you"?

1:38:06.125 --> 1:38:07.000
That's right.

1:38:08.583 --> 1:38:10.167
He's still alive.

1:38:13.208 --> 1:38:14.250
Good.

1:38:19.542 --> 1:38:20.917
I've heard about you.

1:38:22.333 --> 1:38:24.708
You want to write Lucas a letter, right?

1:38:26.083 --> 1:38:26.917
Yeah.

1:38:28.375 --> 1:38:30.083
What do you want me to write?

1:38:35.333 --> 1:38:36.750
Yuris!

1:38:36.833 --> 1:38:37.667
Yuris!

1:39:01.125 --> 1:39:01.958
Yuris.

1:39:03.625 --> 1:39:04.833
You'll be okay.

1:39:58.042 --> 1:40:00.292
Yes! Please connect me!

1:40:00.375 --> 1:40:01.292
Please!

1:40:06.458 --> 1:40:07.500
Yuris.

1:40:08.083 --> 1:40:08.917
It's Lucas.

1:40:16.542 --> 1:40:17.958
What am I supposed to do

1:40:18.042 --> 1:40:19.083
<i>with this?</i>

1:40:23.125 --> 1:40:24.167
You say, "Hello."

1:40:27.583 --> 1:40:28.417
<i>Yuris!</i>

1:40:29.167 --> 1:40:30.000
Yeah.

1:40:30.625 --> 1:40:31.542
<i>Hello.</i>

1:40:33.042 --> 1:40:34.000
Lucas.

1:40:34.833 --> 1:40:35.667
Yeah!

1:40:36.958 --> 1:40:40.833
<i>Lucas, I'm sorry I told you not to come.</i>

1:40:42.917 --> 1:40:45.000
And that I didn't want to see you.

1:40:53.708 --> 1:40:54.542
Sorry.

1:40:56.208 --> 1:40:57.417
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1:41:02.125 --> 1:41:03.875
Why are you apologizing!

1:41:05.750 --> 1:41:06.583
I…

1:41:07.583 --> 1:41:10.750
<i>I was sad when I heard</i>
<i>you didn't want to see me.</i>

1:41:11.167 --> 1:41:14.875
<i>But I thought it was what you wanted.</i>

1:41:14.958 --> 1:41:16.042
<i>So I tried hard.</i>

1:41:18.167 --> 1:41:19.000
But…

1:41:19.542 --> 1:41:21.417
I couldn't help myself.

1:41:22.250 --> 1:41:24.500
And I went to the hospital many times.

1:41:28.542 --> 1:41:32.375
And I saw your face
in the window a little.

1:41:36.542 --> 1:41:37.375
Sorry…

1:41:38.000 --> 1:41:39.500
for saying something…

1:41:40.292 --> 1:41:41.583
so mean.

1:41:41.667 --> 1:41:42.958
<i>No.</i>

1:41:43.667 --> 1:41:44.500
I'm not…

1:41:45.125 --> 1:41:47.083
mad at you at all.

1:41:47.917 --> 1:41:48.750
Yuris.

1:41:51.250 --> 1:41:53.708
We've always been friends, right?

1:41:54.667 --> 1:41:58.292
Let's continue being friends forever.

1:42:05.500 --> 1:42:06.458
Good.

1:42:08.542 --> 1:42:09.542
Thank you.

1:42:36.875 --> 1:42:39.667
That horrible device
comes in handy sometimes.

1:42:45.750 --> 1:42:46.667
Yuris!

1:42:47.875 --> 1:42:49.042
Yuris!

1:42:50.875 --> 1:42:52.292
Yuris!

1:43:24.958 --> 1:43:27.458
She wasn't… able to write the letter.

1:43:33.917 --> 1:43:35.417
But he was able to speak…

1:43:36.458 --> 1:43:38.833
with Lucas on the telephone one last time.

1:43:39.750 --> 1:43:40.667
And tell him…

1:43:42.000 --> 1:43:43.333
what he wanted to say.

1:43:44.667 --> 1:43:45.500
"I'm sorry."

1:43:46.875 --> 1:43:47.708
"Thank you."

1:43:53.417 --> 1:43:56.125
And they delivered the letters you wrote…

1:43:56.667 --> 1:43:59.417
for his parents and brother.

1:44:17.708 --> 1:44:18.625
"Mom,

1:44:19.417 --> 1:44:20.250
Your…

1:44:21.125 --> 1:44:23.583
pancakes were so delicious.

1:44:25.208 --> 1:44:28.292
If I had eaten more vegetables,

1:44:29.458 --> 1:44:32.125
I could have… made you happier."

1:44:36.250 --> 1:44:37.083
"Dad,

1:44:37.917 --> 1:44:41.417
It was fun going fishing and camping.

1:44:42.917 --> 1:44:44.500
Mom… Dad,

1:44:44.583 --> 1:44:45.542
I'm so glad…

1:44:46.542 --> 1:44:48.333
I was born as your son.

1:44:52.083 --> 1:44:53.208
I love you.

1:44:55.625 --> 1:44:56.458
Yuris."

1:45:10.083 --> 1:45:12.708
There's also a letter
for his little brother<i>.</i>

1:45:13.958 --> 1:45:14.917
Me?

1:45:18.333 --> 1:45:19.417
"Sion.

1:45:20.208 --> 1:45:23.750
Sorry for the times
I got mad at you or was mean to you.

1:45:24.625 --> 1:45:27.417
But… I was really happy

1:45:28.083 --> 1:45:29.708
when you were born."

1:45:32.583 --> 1:45:36.417
"Thanks for letting me
become an older brother.

1:45:37.875 --> 1:45:39.792
Live a full life in my place.

1:45:41.500 --> 1:45:42.333
And take care…

1:45:42.917 --> 1:45:45.917
of Mom and Dad in my place.

1:45:48.333 --> 1:45:49.375
Have fun with them.

1:45:51.292 --> 1:45:52.708
And have them spoil you…

1:45:54.000 --> 1:45:55.667
my dear brother.

1:45:59.625 --> 1:46:01.125
From your older brother."

1:46:09.792 --> 1:46:11.917
Thank you, brother!

1:46:12.500 --> 1:46:13.750
I'm so happy!

1:46:14.250 --> 1:46:16.667
Mom and Dad are you happy too?

1:46:18.333 --> 1:46:19.167
Yeah.

1:46:22.167 --> 1:46:23.000
Yes.

1:46:27.625 --> 1:46:28.500
Thank you.

1:46:30.500 --> 1:46:31.333
Yuris.

1:46:38.250 --> 1:46:41.542
They said Yuris was glad
you were able to meet the person…

1:46:42.792 --> 1:46:44.000
who is dear to you.

1:46:53.667 --> 1:46:56.792
Let's visit him again in the morning.

1:46:57.667 --> 1:47:01.042
If he doesn't come out,
I'll kick down his door

1:47:01.125 --> 1:47:03.125
and give him a good thrashing!

1:47:03.208 --> 1:47:04.042
No.

1:47:08.125 --> 1:47:09.458
If he's to be struck…

1:47:10.458 --> 1:47:11.542
then I'll do it.

1:47:13.583 --> 1:47:14.917
-What?
-I'm kidding.

1:47:17.083 --> 1:47:19.583
I'm going back to the postal company…

1:47:21.458 --> 1:47:22.500
on the next boat.

1:47:25.250 --> 1:47:27.167
I'll return to writing letters.

1:47:28.375 --> 1:47:30.208
There is much work I have left.

1:47:33.875 --> 1:47:34.875
Violet.

1:47:36.917 --> 1:47:39.667
The major is alive and safe.

1:47:40.833 --> 1:47:43.167
I thought I'd never see him again.

1:47:45.833 --> 1:47:48.125
But I was… able to hear his voice.

1:47:53.375 --> 1:47:54.292
I'm…

1:47:56.750 --> 1:47:57.583
That's…

1:48:04.833 --> 1:48:06.292
enough for me.

1:49:11.500 --> 1:49:13.625
All right, give it a try.

1:49:38.583 --> 1:49:40.417
There it is! It's coming up!

1:49:41.333 --> 1:49:42.708
That's amazing.

1:49:43.375 --> 1:49:45.792
This will make things a lot easier.

1:49:47.042 --> 1:49:50.167
It's the old man and the girl
from the postal company!

1:49:50.667 --> 1:49:51.542
Old man?

1:49:52.167 --> 1:49:55.917
Hey! Our teacher made that machine!

1:49:58.167 --> 1:49:59.458
Isn't it great?

1:50:02.125 --> 1:50:04.458
-Look, there's a lot!
-Can it hold more?

1:50:05.500 --> 1:50:06.708
It's great!

1:50:07.208 --> 1:50:08.958
Awesome! I wanna try it.

1:50:10.417 --> 1:50:11.250
Right?

1:50:11.750 --> 1:50:13.042
It's amazing, right?

1:50:18.000 --> 1:50:18.833
Yes.

1:50:33.083 --> 1:50:33.958
Will you…

1:50:34.792 --> 1:50:36.750
please give this to your teacher?

1:50:41.208 --> 1:50:43.458
Okay! I'll make sure I give it to him!

1:50:44.875 --> 1:50:45.708
Bye!

1:51:15.042 --> 1:51:17.542
It's not your burden to bear alone.

1:51:19.250 --> 1:51:23.208
All the young men from our island left.

1:51:24.000 --> 1:51:27.250
And lots of people died in the war.

1:51:28.125 --> 1:51:30.583
We're probably all to blame.

1:51:31.417 --> 1:51:33.833
We all thought our lives would be better…

1:51:34.917 --> 1:51:37.042
once we won the war.

1:51:38.958 --> 1:51:43.167
We all hated the people
from Leidenschaftlich.

1:51:45.042 --> 1:51:45.875
But…

1:51:47.333 --> 1:51:49.875
we all suffered in the end.

1:51:53.292 --> 1:51:54.292
All of us.

1:51:59.250 --> 1:52:01.667
If you have a home somewhere else

1:52:01.750 --> 1:52:03.458
you should go back.

1:52:06.292 --> 1:52:07.125
No.

1:52:08.125 --> 1:52:09.125
I'm staying here.

1:52:10.833 --> 1:52:11.875
Staying forever.

1:52:15.375 --> 1:52:17.750
Having you here is a big help to us all.

1:52:36.875 --> 1:52:37.708
Hey!

1:52:45.042 --> 1:52:49.500
Have you finally been able to choose
your own path on this island?

1:52:53.292 --> 1:52:55.417
It sure looks like a nice place.

1:53:00.875 --> 1:53:01.958
Brother.

1:53:02.708 --> 1:53:04.792
You've been living a carefree life.

1:53:06.250 --> 1:53:09.083
And you didn't even come
to our mother's funeral.

1:53:10.792 --> 1:53:14.458
They were fond of you, unlike me.

1:53:16.042 --> 1:53:16.875
Sorry.

1:53:20.583 --> 1:53:24.875
Meanwhile, Violet has been visiting
our mother's grave in your place.

1:53:25.583 --> 1:53:28.292
She still visits every month even now.

1:53:31.500 --> 1:53:32.333
I was…

1:53:32.875 --> 1:53:34.708
planning on apologizing to you…

1:53:36.000 --> 1:53:37.583
if I ever saw you again.

1:53:40.042 --> 1:53:40.875
But right now…

1:53:42.292 --> 1:53:44.167
I ought to stuff you in a sack…

1:53:44.792 --> 1:53:47.667
and drag you off to see Violet!

1:53:53.500 --> 1:53:54.500
I shouldn't have…

1:53:56.208 --> 1:53:57.833
taken her in back then.

1:54:00.250 --> 1:54:02.708
Then what did you really want to do?

1:54:05.500 --> 1:54:07.042
I wanted her to have…

1:54:08.875 --> 1:54:11.333
fun while she was young…

1:54:14.250 --> 1:54:15.625
to be able to enjoy…

1:54:16.583 --> 1:54:17.750
pleasant things…

1:54:22.625 --> 1:54:23.875
to allow her heart…

1:54:25.792 --> 1:54:26.750
to be inspired…

1:54:27.625 --> 1:54:28.667
by beauty.

1:54:31.917 --> 1:54:32.750
I wanted…

1:54:33.792 --> 1:54:35.875
to provide her with that.

1:54:39.167 --> 1:54:40.000
But I…

1:55:06.667 --> 1:55:07.625
It's for you.

1:55:08.875 --> 1:55:09.708
Read it.

1:55:32.042 --> 1:55:34.375
<i>Dearest Major Gilbert,</i>

1:55:35.500 --> 1:55:38.375
<i>Please forgive me</i>
<i>for visiting you so suddenly.</i>

1:55:40.667 --> 1:55:41.500
<i>This is…</i>

1:55:42.125 --> 1:55:43.375
<i>my last letter…</i>

1:55:44.167 --> 1:55:45.333
<i>to you.</i>

1:55:48.167 --> 1:55:49.083
<i>The reason…</i>

1:55:50.292 --> 1:55:51.375
<i>I'm alive today…</i>

1:55:52.208 --> 1:55:54.125
<i>and learned how to love others</i>…

1:55:55.500 --> 1:55:56.750
<i>is all thanks to you.</i>

1:55:59.958 --> 1:56:00.792
<i>For…</i>

1:56:01.625 --> 1:56:03.000
<i>accepting me…</i>

1:56:03.750 --> 1:56:05.167
<i>I thank you.</i>

1:56:07.250 --> 1:56:08.917
<i>Thank you for reading to me.</i>

1:56:10.667 --> 1:56:14.083
<i>For teaching me how to read,</i>
<i>and showing me many things…</i>

1:56:15.458 --> 1:56:16.792
<i>I thank you.</i>

1:56:23.667 --> 1:56:25.292
<i>For the brooch you gave me…</i>

1:56:27.583 --> 1:56:28.875
<i>I thank you.</i>

1:56:31.875 --> 1:56:32.833
<i>For always…</i>

1:56:33.917 --> 1:56:35.833
<i>always keeping me by your side…</i>

1:56:37.917 --> 1:56:39.208
<i>I thank you.</i>

1:56:47.000 --> 1:56:48.083
With all my heart…

1:56:54.667 --> 1:56:56.875
<i>For giving me "I love you"…</i>

1:56:58.708 --> 1:56:59.917
<i>I thank you.</i>

1:57:04.917 --> 1:57:07.375
<i>Hearing you tell me "I love you"…</i>

1:57:08.417 --> 1:57:10.917
<i>has been like a guiding light in my life.</i>

1:57:14.708 --> 1:57:17.917
<i>Since I've learned</i>
<i>what "I love you" means…</i>

1:57:19.583 --> 1:57:21.833
<i>I wanted to tell you that I love you.</i>

1:57:32.292 --> 1:57:33.125
<i>Major.</i>

1:57:35.542 --> 1:57:36.833
<i>I thank you.</i>

1:57:40.292 --> 1:57:41.125
<i>Thank you.</i>

1:57:44.500 --> 1:57:46.500
<i>I thank you for everything.</i>

1:58:19.208 --> 1:58:20.167
We all struggle…

1:58:21.000 --> 1:58:23.667
with being true to ourselves.

1:58:38.000 --> 1:58:40.500
I will carry
the Bougainvillea family name.

1:58:41.333 --> 1:58:43.625
You may be free.

1:58:51.583 --> 1:58:52.417
Go.

2:00:12.958 --> 2:00:14.083
Violet!

2:00:19.333 --> 2:00:21.833
Violet!

2:00:30.875 --> 2:00:32.292
Major?

2:00:37.958 --> 2:00:38.875
Gilbert.

2:01:01.417 --> 2:01:02.250
Major!

2:01:04.083 --> 2:01:04.917
Violet!

2:02:04.500 --> 2:02:05.333
Major.

2:02:10.917 --> 2:02:11.750
Violet.

2:02:12.667 --> 2:02:16.083
I'm not your master
or your superior officer anymore.

2:02:19.667 --> 2:02:21.292
I hurt you.

2:02:22.708 --> 2:02:23.542
I'm not…

2:02:24.750 --> 2:02:26.625
the man you think I am.

2:02:29.750 --> 2:02:31.167
I'm not a good master…

2:02:32.208 --> 2:02:33.625
or a good person.

2:02:37.958 --> 2:02:38.792
I don't…

2:02:40.458 --> 2:02:42.000
deserve you.

2:02:50.042 --> 2:02:51.000
But even now…

2:02:59.750 --> 2:03:00.583
Still…

2:03:01.583 --> 2:03:02.417
Still I…

2:03:05.833 --> 2:03:06.708
I love you.

2:03:12.125 --> 2:03:12.958
I…

2:03:18.208 --> 2:03:19.833
I want you to stay with me.

2:03:21.125 --> 2:03:22.000
Violet.

2:03:26.417 --> 2:03:27.292
I…

2:03:33.000 --> 2:03:33.833
Major.

2:03:40.042 --> 2:03:40.875
Major.

2:03:43.167 --> 2:03:44.083
I…

2:03:51.375 --> 2:03:52.500
Violet.

2:03:53.792 --> 2:03:54.625
Don't cry.

2:03:56.917 --> 2:03:57.875
You see?

2:03:58.417 --> 2:03:59.250
I'm…

2:04:00.250 --> 2:04:01.667
I'm about to cry too.

2:04:05.458 --> 2:04:07.333
I want to wipe away your tears.

2:04:10.000 --> 2:04:10.833
Please.

2:04:11.542 --> 2:04:12.708
Lift your face.

2:04:18.792 --> 2:04:19.833
I…

2:04:23.667 --> 2:04:24.500
Major…

2:04:31.792 --> 2:04:32.667
Major…

2:05:02.083 --> 2:05:02.917
I love you…

2:05:04.250 --> 2:05:05.083
Violet.

2:05:08.208 --> 2:05:10.042
I've always wanted to do this.

2:08:51.458 --> 2:08:54.708
<i>After wrapping up her remaining work…</i>

2:08:56.417 --> 2:08:58.750
<i>she quit her job at the postal company…</i>

2:09:00.875 --> 2:09:04.667
<i>and took over the postal service</i>
<i>at the lighthouse on the island.</i>

2:09:07.167 --> 2:09:12.667
<i>Afterwards, the post office moved</i>
<i>to the main street.</i>

2:09:29.542 --> 2:09:34.042
<i>Once telephones became common,</i>
<i>the dolls ceased their work.</i>

2:09:37.042 --> 2:09:39.375
<i>But I'm sure she wrote many letters…</i>

2:09:40.625 --> 2:09:45.000
<i>for the people who lived on the island.</i>

2:09:50.833 --> 2:09:51.875
<i>Meanwhile…</i>

2:09:55.417 --> 2:09:59.833
This stamp was issued by the CH
Postal Company Memorial Foundation,

2:09:59.917 --> 2:10:03.083
and is only sold on this island.

2:10:05.042 --> 2:10:07.500
The island holds the record

2:10:07.583 --> 2:10:10.750
for the most letters
sent each year per person.

2:10:12.375 --> 2:10:15.958
A long time ago, it used to be a job
done by women called dolls.

2:10:16.958 --> 2:10:22.208
There was a popular doll who lived
on this island and who everyone loved.

2:10:30.875 --> 2:10:32.292
Her name was…

2:10:32.917 --> 2:10:34.625
Violet Evergarden.

2:10:39.917 --> 2:10:44.583
She had also written letters
which my grandmother received.

2:11:01.083 --> 2:11:03.042
<i>If there's something I can't say…</i>

2:11:04.042 --> 2:11:06.167
<i>maybe I could tell them in a letter.</i>

2:11:09.208 --> 2:11:11.792
<i>I want to tell them my true feelings.</i>

2:11:14.458 --> 2:11:16.500
<i>The people I want to tell my feelings…</i>

2:11:19.042 --> 2:11:22.167
<i>are... only here in this moment.</i>

2:11:38.667 --> 2:11:39.500
Dad.

2:11:42.208 --> 2:11:43.042
<i>Mom.</i>

2:11:48.292 --> 2:11:49.208
<i>Thank you.</i>

2:11:53.750 --> 2:12:03.458
I LOVE YOU

2:12:29.792 --> 2:12:42.292
VIOLET EVERGARDEN

2:19:55.917 --> 2:19:58.958
