WEBVTT

00:12.186 --> 00:13.100
Previously.

00:13.143 --> 00:14.753
I'm texting with Agent Tenant.

00:14.797 --> 00:17.060
A missing witness from an old
case of mine might've turned up

00:17.104 --> 00:18.844
in Oahu, and she's checking it
out for me.

00:18.888 --> 00:21.673
This is about a munitions
explosion in Afghanistan.

00:21.717 --> 00:24.676
Actually Director, since this is
still my case I would like to

00:24.720 --> 00:27.070
put this one to bed myself.
>We don't know this witness.

00:27.114 --> 00:29.464
And Torres does, woudn't hurt to
have him.

00:29.507 --> 00:31.640
You don't get it, if you guys
found me that means they found

00:31.683 --> 00:32.902
me too.
>As long as- [gunshots]

00:38.516 --> 00:40.040
[Torres coughing]

00:42.172 --> 00:43.956
Tennant, you hit?TENNANT: No.

00:44.000 --> 00:44.522
You?

00:44.566 --> 00:45.741
I'm good.

00:45.784 --> 00:47.525
Can't say
the same for him.

00:47.569 --> 00:48.700
[gunfire]

00:53.270 --> 00:54.445
We got to make a move.

00:54.489 --> 00:55.620
Okay.

00:55.664 --> 00:57.274
[exhales]
Queen of the Castle.

00:57.318 --> 00:59.363
I'm down. Three, two, go.

01:05.326 --> 01:06.370
Go!

01:12.507 --> 01:14.552
TORRES:
Tennant, you.

01:23.735 --> 01:25.215
Reloading.Well,

01:25.259 --> 01:27.087
Your Majesty, they took
cover behind that structure.

01:30.002 --> 01:31.526
[quietly]: Go.

01:36.618 --> 01:38.794
Clear.Clear here, too.

01:42.493 --> 01:44.147
TORRES:
Who the hell were those guys?

01:44.191 --> 01:45.322
I haven't been
ambushed in a while.

01:45.366 --> 01:46.584
You've been here
for three hours.

01:46.628 --> 01:48.064
Well, I'm an acquired taste.[chuckles]

01:50.022 --> 01:52.590
Hey, Jesse.
We just got hit on Kam Highway.

01:52.634 --> 01:55.463
Two gunmen, they fled.
One dead body.

01:55.506 --> 01:57.595
Tennant? Strike that.

01:57.639 --> 01:58.814
Jennings is gone.

01:58.857 --> 02:00.729
Hang on.

02:09.172 --> 02:11.174
â™ª

02:19.878 --> 02:21.750
[indistinct radio chatter]

02:21.793 --> 02:24.361
TENNANT: Our missing victim
is Kyle Jennings.

02:24.405 --> 02:28.626
Former employee of Fortress,
a war-zone private contractor.

02:28.670 --> 02:30.193
Any idea who hit you?

02:30.237 --> 02:32.369
Best guess,
two to three-man team.

02:32.413 --> 02:34.110
Two men came,
drew us from the car,

02:34.154 --> 02:36.286
someone came and took the body.

02:36.330 --> 02:37.722
You get anything else?

02:37.766 --> 02:39.724
Well, yes and no.

02:39.768 --> 02:40.943
I mean, no fingerprints,

02:40.986 --> 02:43.380
no blood trail, so...

02:43.424 --> 02:45.774
A professional crew,
highly trained.

02:45.817 --> 02:47.341
Yeah, and highly
motivated,

02:47.384 --> 02:49.821
going after federal
agents in broad daylight.

02:49.865 --> 02:52.128
They must have left
something behind.

02:52.172 --> 02:54.478
Well, we're scouring the area.
If it's here, we'll find it.

02:55.784 --> 02:57.046
He okay over there?

03:09.276 --> 03:10.407
You good, Nick?

03:10.451 --> 03:12.583
Yeah, it's just, uh,

03:12.627 --> 03:15.325
this is the most beautiful place
I've ever been shot at.

03:18.894 --> 03:21.505
These views
never get old.

03:21.549 --> 03:23.115
You know, I wish
I had a few more days,

03:23.159 --> 03:25.248
just so I can have
the full Hawai'i experience.

03:25.292 --> 03:27.598
Snorkeling,
sunsets by the beach,

03:27.642 --> 03:29.774
one too many Mai Tais at a luau.

03:29.818 --> 03:31.341
Full tourist mode.

03:31.385 --> 03:34.214
Yeah, it doesn't
seem likely now.

03:34.257 --> 03:36.825
Well, you never know.

03:36.868 --> 03:39.219
Would help if we had a
little more information.

03:39.262 --> 03:41.656
Our suspects got
a clean getaway.

03:43.614 --> 03:45.268
Not totally clean.

03:48.880 --> 03:50.578
TENNANT:
Tire tracks.

03:50.621 --> 03:54.103
It's time for me to read the
rest of the team in on this.

03:55.191 --> 03:58.020
Marine Corporal Daniel Menlo.

03:58.063 --> 04:00.544
Died in a munitions blast
five years ago in Afghanistan.

04:00.588 --> 04:03.286
Private war-zone contractor.

04:03.330 --> 04:04.853
Fortress took
responsibility.

04:04.896 --> 04:06.289
TORRES:
Claimed it was an accident.

04:06.333 --> 04:07.725
Improper grenade storage.

04:07.769 --> 04:09.466
Big companies don't
usually admit fault

04:09.510 --> 04:11.120
for stuff like that.

04:11.163 --> 04:12.600
Yeah, not without pointing
the finger at someone.

04:12.643 --> 04:14.123
Mm-hmm.

04:14.166 --> 04:16.952
Greg Winslow,
a Fortress munitions specialist.

04:16.995 --> 04:19.171
Fortress claims he improperly
stored the grenades.

04:19.215 --> 04:20.825
They apologized, paid a fine,

04:20.869 --> 04:22.740
and...KAI: Let me guess.

04:22.784 --> 04:24.264
Fired Greg Winslow.

04:25.482 --> 04:27.136
Since Corporal Menlo
was based in Quantico,

04:27.179 --> 04:29.094
I went to Afghanistan
to investigate.

04:29.138 --> 04:30.313
You speak to Winslow?

04:30.357 --> 04:31.880
He'd already been
sent stateside.

04:31.923 --> 04:33.577
Died in a single-car accident
a week later.

04:33.621 --> 04:35.100
Drove his SUV into the Potomac.

04:35.144 --> 04:37.146
And they pinned it all on him.

04:37.189 --> 04:39.061
But there was one piece missing.

04:40.367 --> 04:41.542
TENNANT: Kyle Jennings.

04:41.585 --> 04:43.370
Another Fortress operator.

04:43.413 --> 04:45.154
Stationed in Afghanistan.

04:45.197 --> 04:46.851
And the only survivor
of the munitions blast.

04:46.895 --> 04:48.723
He also went missing
before I could question him.

04:48.766 --> 04:49.941
TENNANT: Fortress claims

04:49.985 --> 04:51.073
he fled from the accident

04:51.116 --> 04:52.292
and never reported in.

04:52.335 --> 04:54.294
He's been M.I.A. for five years.

04:54.337 --> 04:56.121
So, how'd you track
him to Hawai'i?

04:56.165 --> 04:58.341
I've been receiving
anonymous tips for years.

04:58.385 --> 05:00.430
A city, a motel name,

05:00.474 --> 05:02.867
photos of Jennings
in iconic locations.

05:02.911 --> 05:05.305
By the time I ran them,
Jennings would be gone.

05:05.348 --> 05:07.002
TENNANT: Until two days ago.

05:07.045 --> 05:09.352
Torres received this selfie
of Jennings on the North Shore.

05:09.396 --> 05:11.049
We went and picked him up
before he could flee.

05:11.093 --> 05:12.877
Then you got attacked.

05:14.052 --> 05:16.664
Now Jennings is dead
and his body is gone.

05:16.707 --> 05:18.535
Could the anonymous source
be the one

05:18.579 --> 05:21.930
who organized the attack?

05:21.973 --> 05:23.540
Used you to smoke him out?

05:23.584 --> 05:25.325
Someone inside Fortress?

05:25.368 --> 05:26.717
Both possible.

05:26.761 --> 05:28.240
Yeah, but why take the body?

05:28.284 --> 05:29.285
Add that the list of things

05:29.329 --> 05:30.286
we got to figure out.

05:30.330 --> 05:31.374
Ernie is trying to track down

05:31.418 --> 05:32.636
whoever's sending the tips.

05:32.680 --> 05:34.899
Hopefully, we can
narrow down that list.

05:34.943 --> 05:35.944
All right, well,
we'll keep working on finding

05:35.987 --> 05:36.988
the men who attacked you.

05:37.032 --> 05:38.381
Hey, if I may...

05:38.425 --> 05:40.035
If I can just...

05:40.078 --> 05:43.081
I'd like to address the
elephant in the room.

05:43.125 --> 05:44.822
I know there's all these
rumors going around

05:44.866 --> 05:48.043
about what happened with
Tennant and I back in Orlando,

05:48.086 --> 05:49.261
but I just wanted to say,

05:49.305 --> 05:51.612
it was just a conference,
all right?

05:51.655 --> 05:52.874
Like, nothing happened,

05:52.917 --> 05:54.571
all right? Everything
was purely professional.

05:54.615 --> 05:58.314
This-this T'N'T nickname--

05:58.358 --> 05:59.924
come on, man, there's...

05:59.968 --> 06:02.840
there's no secret
meaning behind it, okay?

06:08.237 --> 06:10.195
Yeah.

06:10.239 --> 06:11.762
They didn't know.

06:12.981 --> 06:14.330
Hmm.

06:14.374 --> 06:16.288
[phone vibrates]

06:16.332 --> 06:17.420
Ernie's got something.

06:17.464 --> 06:18.726
Mm.

06:21.163 --> 06:22.425
Where's my backpack?

06:22.469 --> 06:23.731
It's right...Can you... Sure.

06:26.516 --> 06:27.604
T'N'T?

06:27.648 --> 06:28.779
Okay, what happened in Orlando?

06:28.823 --> 06:31.391
I have so many questions.

06:34.132 --> 06:35.569
Okay.

06:36.613 --> 06:38.572
T'N'T, huh?

06:38.615 --> 06:40.051
Tennant and Torres.

06:40.095 --> 06:42.227
Of course they texted you
immediately.

06:42.271 --> 06:44.186
Hey, don't get me wrong.
A solid nickname.

06:44.229 --> 06:46.231
But matching tattoos?Where'd you get that?

06:46.275 --> 06:47.668
Nowhere. Just fishing.

06:47.711 --> 06:48.930
Okay, moving on.

06:48.973 --> 06:50.540
Right, right.

06:50.584 --> 06:52.673
Anonymous source sending
you leads on Kyle Jennings.

06:52.716 --> 06:54.109
That would be nice.

06:54.152 --> 06:55.415
I got nothing.

06:55.458 --> 06:56.764
Series of encrypted
IP addresses

06:56.807 --> 06:58.330
bouncing back and forth.

06:58.374 --> 07:00.332
Torres' people in D.C.
didn't have any luck, either.

07:00.376 --> 07:02.683
You know I don't
believe in luck.

07:03.858 --> 07:05.599
Meaning you found
something else?

07:05.642 --> 07:07.862
Just info on your tire tracks.

07:10.212 --> 07:13.650
Based on the tread depth, size
and pattern, we're looking

07:13.694 --> 07:15.435
for a rear-engine
four-wheel drive vehicle

07:15.478 --> 07:16.740
capable of off-roading.

07:16.784 --> 07:20.048
Specifically,
a cream-colored VW Vanagon.

07:20.091 --> 07:21.179
You got all that
from tire tracks?

07:21.223 --> 07:23.051
I got some of that
from the tracks.

07:23.094 --> 07:25.357
The vehicle itself I got from
traffic cams along your route.

07:25.401 --> 07:27.751
Vanagon followed you
to the ambush.

07:27.795 --> 07:29.144
BOLO out?
Yep.

07:29.187 --> 07:31.015
But I'm not done.

07:31.059 --> 07:33.844
Forensics found trace
amounts of pollen

07:33.888 --> 07:37.239
inside your tracks,
from a Selenicereus pteranthus.

07:37.282 --> 07:38.762
That's the Latin name for...

07:38.806 --> 07:40.068
Princess of the Night.

07:41.199 --> 07:42.244
It's a night-blooming cactus.

07:42.287 --> 07:43.419
Pretty rare.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.943
Oh, you got mad botany skills.

07:45.987 --> 07:47.945
Only one place
on this island

07:47.989 --> 07:50.339
where you can camp
that has these.

07:50.382 --> 07:51.949
Lulumahu Botanical Garden.

07:51.993 --> 07:53.429
How many campsites?

07:53.473 --> 07:54.648
31.All right.

07:54.691 --> 07:55.736
Looks like Torres might get

07:55.779 --> 07:56.867
some sightseeing in after all.

07:56.911 --> 07:58.652
T'N'T is back, baby.

07:58.695 --> 08:00.305
[scoffs]

08:03.744 --> 08:05.702
[door opens]

08:05.746 --> 08:08.270
TORRES:
You know, when I vacation
with this much sunshine,

08:08.313 --> 08:11.012
I'm kind of a sit-by-the-pool
kind of guy.

08:11.055 --> 08:12.535
Well, quicker
we find our suspects,

08:12.579 --> 08:14.406
the sooner we'll make
that a reality.

08:14.450 --> 08:16.713
I think there's
another campsite

08:16.757 --> 08:19.716
just around that
monkeypod tree.

08:22.980 --> 08:24.895
I'm impressed, Torres.Oh, don't be.

08:24.939 --> 08:27.071
I saw a sign back there.

08:27.115 --> 08:30.074
No, I mean, I'm impressed
you stuck with this case

08:30.118 --> 08:33.600
even after it seemed
wrapped up.

08:33.643 --> 08:35.297
Not everyone would.

08:35.340 --> 08:38.866
Well, I flew back with
Corporal Menlo's, uh, body.

08:38.909 --> 08:41.738
I met his family
on the tarmac.

08:41.782 --> 08:46.134
And I promised them
I, I'd find answers.

08:46.177 --> 08:48.136
Technically
there wasan answer.

08:48.179 --> 08:50.225
Mm, yeah.

08:50.268 --> 08:52.488
"Accident" didn't
ring true to me.

08:52.532 --> 08:55.970
Plus, I felt like I left
a mess in Afghanistan.

08:56.013 --> 08:57.798
So you needed to clean it up.

08:57.841 --> 08:59.713
Rule 45.Rule 45.

09:10.898 --> 09:12.552
Take the right.

09:22.823 --> 09:24.085
GREG:
Special Agent Torres.

09:28.655 --> 09:30.091
We meet at last.

09:31.309 --> 09:33.921
I'm sorry.

09:33.964 --> 09:35.923
I have no idea who you are.

09:35.966 --> 09:36.967
Really?

09:38.273 --> 09:39.927
But I do need you
to lower that weapon.

09:39.970 --> 09:42.016
Please and thank you.

09:46.281 --> 09:47.456
You really don't know who I am?

09:47.499 --> 09:49.501
Of course I know who you are.

09:49.545 --> 09:51.155
You're Greg Winslow.

09:51.199 --> 09:54.115
Fortress operator who drove
his car into the Potomac.

09:54.158 --> 09:55.290
[handcuffs click]

09:55.333 --> 09:56.726
Not so dead after all.

10:06.954 --> 10:08.825
[Greg sighs]

10:08.869 --> 10:11.611
Relax, Greg. You're
surrounded by federal agents.

10:11.654 --> 10:14.962
[scoffs] Five years anticipating
a sniper's bullet.

10:15.005 --> 10:16.398
Hard habit to break.

10:16.441 --> 10:17.834
TORRES:
Well, you're safe.

10:17.878 --> 10:19.749
And we have some questions.[chuckles]

10:19.793 --> 10:21.664
I promise, whatever you believe
happened isn't what happened.

10:21.708 --> 10:23.666
So you didn't fake
your own death,

10:23.710 --> 10:25.581
follow us and kill Jennings?

10:25.625 --> 10:27.061
Well, you got that
only partly wrong.

10:27.104 --> 10:29.541
Two out of three,
67% or rather 66.6%.

10:29.585 --> 10:31.674
Focus.[exhales]

10:31.718 --> 10:35.243
I did fake my own death
and I was following you,

10:35.286 --> 10:37.593
but I didn't kill Jennings.
That was Fortress.

10:37.637 --> 10:40.074
Well, why did Fortress
want Jennings dead?

10:40.117 --> 10:41.858
Because you
finally caught him.

10:41.902 --> 10:44.208
They needed to close the loop.

10:44.252 --> 10:45.819
[softly]: Because the
explosion in Afghanistan

10:45.862 --> 10:46.863
was no accident.

10:47.908 --> 10:49.126
[whispers]:
It was intentional.

10:49.170 --> 10:50.693
Yeah, we know.

10:52.042 --> 10:53.217
You do?

10:53.261 --> 10:55.132
Question is, why?

10:55.176 --> 10:56.656
Oh, no clue.

10:56.699 --> 10:58.005
All I know is,
Jennings was the last one

10:58.048 --> 10:59.789
near the depot
before the big kaboom.

10:59.833 --> 11:02.444
What is Jennings' connection
with Corporal Menlo?

11:02.487 --> 11:04.272
Look, I worked for Fortress.

11:04.315 --> 11:05.708
But I-I just managed
munitions depots.

11:05.752 --> 11:07.492
I wasn't out doing stuff.

11:07.536 --> 11:09.364
But Jennings was.

11:09.407 --> 11:11.061
Doing stuff?

11:11.105 --> 11:12.715
Yeah, he was working
in concert with the Marines.

11:12.759 --> 11:15.457
Securing villages
cleared of bad actors.

11:15.500 --> 11:17.589
Did he ever work directly
with Corporal Menlo?

11:17.633 --> 11:18.678
Well, the percentage
chance would...

11:19.722 --> 11:21.768
[sighs]
I don't know.

11:21.811 --> 11:23.552
You don't know much.

11:23.595 --> 11:27.208
You sure faking your own death
wasn't an overreaction?

11:27.251 --> 11:30.820
I know one thing.
I didn't blow up the depot.

11:30.864 --> 11:33.562
But Fortress framed me, fired
me and was gonna kill me,

11:33.605 --> 11:35.085
so I did it first,
and then I made it my mission

11:35.129 --> 11:36.913
to find Jennings.

11:36.957 --> 11:39.307
You're the one who's been
giving Torres anonymous tips.

11:39.350 --> 11:41.788
GREG:Well, thankfully,
he acted on them.

11:41.831 --> 11:43.572
Torres is the Batman
to my Robin.

11:43.615 --> 11:44.834
Hmm?

11:44.878 --> 11:45.966
The Sherlock
to my Watson. The, uh...

11:46.009 --> 11:47.271
All right, I get the metaphor.

11:47.315 --> 11:49.273
Can I just say
that this is nice?

11:49.317 --> 11:51.667
The banter, you know,
sitting on a bench.

11:51.711 --> 11:53.060
Haven't had a real conversation
in years.

11:53.103 --> 11:54.626
Okay. Look, if Fortress

11:54.670 --> 11:56.280
tried to kill you
and actually killed Jennings,

11:56.324 --> 11:58.195
there's got to be a reason.Yeah.

11:58.239 --> 12:00.110
Kind of hoping
you guys can find out why.

12:05.376 --> 12:07.161
LUCY:
What do y'all know

12:07.204 --> 12:09.598
about BASE jumping?

12:09.641 --> 12:11.078
Enough not to do it.

12:11.121 --> 12:13.384
Think it's possible to BASE jump
off Cinderella's Castle?

12:14.777 --> 12:17.084
Tennant and Torres?Mm-hmm.

12:17.127 --> 12:19.826
Spoke to a friend at the field
office in Jacksonville.

12:19.869 --> 12:21.392
And they told you that our boss

12:21.436 --> 12:23.743
was BASE jumping
in an amusement park?

12:23.786 --> 12:27.224
Said it was a series of dares
and they never actually jumped.

12:27.268 --> 12:29.313
You hear the words
coming out of your mouth?

12:29.357 --> 12:32.708
I do. Just vetting it.

12:32.752 --> 12:34.231
Well, how about we vet
Greg Winslow's story first?

12:34.275 --> 12:36.103
He says that Jennings
was responsible

12:36.146 --> 12:37.626
for the explosion. Why?

12:37.669 --> 12:39.846
If it was money,
would have been cash.

12:39.889 --> 12:41.978
I pulled Jennings' financials--

12:42.022 --> 12:43.937
not a dollar in or out
since he ran.

12:43.980 --> 12:46.548
The guy disappeared
after the explosion.

12:46.591 --> 12:48.463
On and off the radar
for five years.

12:48.506 --> 12:49.986
I mean, he clearly
had resources.

12:50.030 --> 12:51.596
LUCY:
And motivation.

12:51.640 --> 12:54.512
Didn't want to be found
by Torres or Fortress.

12:54.556 --> 12:56.123
He knew something
and got killed for it.

12:56.166 --> 12:58.386
Yeah, but they didn't
just kill him.

12:58.429 --> 13:00.257
I mean, they took his body.

13:00.301 --> 13:01.563
If it was just
about what he knew,

13:01.606 --> 13:03.434
why make his body disappear?

13:03.478 --> 13:08.004
Seems like the body itself
was important.

13:08.048 --> 13:09.005
Maybe his body was evidence.

13:09.049 --> 13:10.050
Exactly.

13:10.093 --> 13:12.704
Oh, creepy. But interesting.

13:12.748 --> 13:15.403
So, how do you make a body
totally disappear?

13:15.446 --> 13:16.404
You dump it in the ocean.

13:16.447 --> 13:18.058
Coast Guard and HPD

13:18.101 --> 13:19.363
have been searching waterways.

13:19.407 --> 13:21.452
Nothing yet.You burn it.

13:21.496 --> 13:24.064
Nothing to find if it's ashes.

13:24.107 --> 13:25.413
All right, let's find
local incinerators.

13:25.456 --> 13:26.849
Places that our suspects

13:26.893 --> 13:28.851
could get access.

13:28.895 --> 13:30.810
Hey, hey, Ernie?

13:30.853 --> 13:32.637
That still leaves the question

13:32.681 --> 13:35.684
of why our suspects went
to all this trouble.

13:35.727 --> 13:38.513
Well, D.C. sent us
the original case file.

13:38.556 --> 13:40.515
Maybe there's
something we missed.

13:42.473 --> 13:43.953
[inhales sharply]

13:43.997 --> 13:45.302
[door beeps, opens]

13:46.347 --> 13:47.870
So...

13:52.048 --> 13:54.094
You see her, too, right?Yeah. Yeah, I do.

13:54.137 --> 13:55.312
Uh, I-I'm sorry.

13:55.356 --> 13:58.054
Hi. You are...?

13:58.098 --> 14:00.665
Special Agent
Jessica Knight.

14:00.709 --> 14:03.625
Legend of the REACT team,
expert negotiator,

14:03.668 --> 14:05.105
general badass.

14:07.716 --> 14:08.978
I read the newsletter.

14:09.022 --> 14:10.414
Parker sent me,

14:10.458 --> 14:12.329
along with the Afghanistan
case files.

14:12.373 --> 14:15.376
And to make sure Torres comes
home without any bullet wounds.

14:15.419 --> 14:17.900
My team has gone through
enough personnel changes.

14:17.944 --> 14:20.033
Hmm. Well,
I'm Special Agent Tara.

14:20.076 --> 14:21.469
This is Ernie.

14:21.512 --> 14:23.950
Hi.Uh, he doesn't really like it

14:23.993 --> 14:25.777
when people are sitting
in his chair.

14:25.821 --> 14:26.909
ERNIE:
Uh, Lucy, hush, hush.

14:26.953 --> 14:28.868
It's-it's okay.

14:31.044 --> 14:32.480
Well, I'm not sure you're
gonna be enlightened

14:32.523 --> 14:34.482
by this case file,
it is pretty thin.

14:34.525 --> 14:37.311
But I also bring
expertise with Fortress.

14:37.354 --> 14:38.747
They've tried recruiting me
over the years,

14:38.790 --> 14:41.184
offering big money,
big benefits.

14:41.228 --> 14:43.360
Ugh. Who'd want that?ERNIE:
That makes sense.

14:43.404 --> 14:45.754
Overpaying for talent
is sort of their thing.

14:45.797 --> 14:47.887
Along with disregard
for moral and ethical lines.

14:47.930 --> 14:51.412
Can't think of anyone better
suited to make a body disappear.

14:51.455 --> 14:53.849
What-what do we have
in the case file?

14:53.893 --> 14:56.156
Fortress was trying
to put this to bed quickly, so,

14:56.199 --> 14:58.332
not much.
Um, can I sit?

14:58.375 --> 15:00.595
Yes, yes.Okay. Um...

15:00.638 --> 15:03.250
So we've got some

15:03.293 --> 15:05.643
video footage of the explosion.

15:05.687 --> 15:07.645
Been trying to put it up on
your monitor, but I can't seem

15:07.689 --> 15:09.169
to figure out
your clicker situation.

15:09.212 --> 15:10.605
Oh, sorry.

15:10.648 --> 15:13.173
Sorry. That's for my jellyfish.

15:15.479 --> 15:17.394
Groovy, huh?

15:17.438 --> 15:18.918
Totally.
Yeah.

15:21.355 --> 15:23.270
Here you go.

15:25.968 --> 15:27.927
LUCY:
Well,

15:27.970 --> 15:29.406
that tells us nothing.

15:29.450 --> 15:31.408
Not enough to prove
it was intentional.

15:31.452 --> 15:33.149
Uh, not enough
to prove it wasn't.

15:33.193 --> 15:36.326
So, what do we do?

15:36.370 --> 15:38.676
We recreate it.

15:38.720 --> 15:40.896
You can do that?

15:40.940 --> 15:43.943
I can do many things, milady.

15:49.731 --> 15:51.385
What?

15:51.428 --> 15:53.387
Oh, nothing.

15:53.430 --> 15:55.911
[quietly]:
You got a type.

15:56.912 --> 15:59.045
[sighs]

16:00.568 --> 16:02.570
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down there, buddy.

16:02.613 --> 16:04.354
It's just so good.

16:04.398 --> 16:06.008
Tastes of the island.

16:06.052 --> 16:08.054
Mm.It's from a local place.

16:08.097 --> 16:09.316
It was actually meant
for the both of you.

16:11.057 --> 16:12.536
Sorry, dude.
You want in on this?

16:12.580 --> 16:13.842
Nah, I'm good.

16:13.885 --> 16:15.278
All I've been eating are MREs

16:15.322 --> 16:17.019
and day-old taquitos
from 7-Eleven.

16:17.063 --> 16:19.021
Well, someone needs
to learn about takeout.

16:19.065 --> 16:21.023
We'll get more.

16:21.067 --> 16:24.722
I take it since I'm back in
gen pop, you believe my story?

16:24.766 --> 16:26.289
Looking into it.

16:26.333 --> 16:28.857
But as a colleague of ours
likes to say,

16:28.900 --> 16:31.729
"If it seems
someone's out to get you..."

16:31.773 --> 16:33.688
"They usually are."

16:33.731 --> 16:35.472
We have more questions.

16:35.516 --> 16:37.561
I've told you everything I know.You haven't told us

16:37.605 --> 16:39.476
how you managed to get intel
on Jennings' movements

16:39.520 --> 16:41.087
when no one else could.

16:41.130 --> 16:44.177
Well, that's easy. Darlene.TORRES:Darlene?

16:44.220 --> 16:45.743
What's that? Is that, like,

16:45.787 --> 16:47.745
a computer program?
Some kind of, uh,

16:47.789 --> 16:50.226
Fortress
whistleblower?It's Jennings' mom.

16:50.270 --> 16:51.662
She's a lovely woman.

16:51.706 --> 16:53.099
TENNANT:
Okay. I'm sorry.

16:53.142 --> 16:55.536
You're in contact
with Jennings' mother?

16:55.579 --> 16:57.668
We became friends
on social media.

16:58.713 --> 17:01.542
I used an alias, of course.
Um...

17:01.585 --> 17:03.152
[snaps fingers]
Rick from Roanoke.

17:03.196 --> 17:06.503
Former school teacher and
avid antiquer, just like her.

17:06.547 --> 17:08.244
You know, I, too,
don't understand

17:08.288 --> 17:10.681
why people buy jeans
with holes already in them.

17:10.725 --> 17:13.423
So you got Darlene chatting
about her son?

17:13.467 --> 17:15.077
Well, he never called
or visited,

17:15.121 --> 17:17.079
but he did send postcards

17:17.123 --> 17:19.212
from whatever exotic locale
he was in.

17:19.255 --> 17:21.475
It's the one mistake
Jennings made.

17:21.518 --> 17:24.217
TORRES:When you go
off the grid...

17:26.306 --> 17:28.960
...you can't keep in touch
with anyone.

17:31.702 --> 17:34.357
I have a sister in Albuquerque
who thinks I'm dead.

17:35.967 --> 17:37.491
You know how many times

17:37.534 --> 17:39.710
I've wanted to call
and tell her I'm not?

17:44.846 --> 17:47.153
Look, you've known
Tennant the longest.

17:47.196 --> 17:48.676
What do you think
happened in Orlando?

17:48.719 --> 17:51.548
I don't do gossip,
especially about our boss.

17:51.592 --> 17:53.550
Plus, I already know
what happened.

17:53.594 --> 17:56.510
Wait. Want to give me a hint?

17:56.553 --> 17:58.077
I'll tell you this.

17:58.120 --> 18:01.167
It involved a crashed wedding,
a stolen pontoon boat

18:01.210 --> 18:04.257
and a, uh, adolescent alligator.

18:04.300 --> 18:06.781
Are you...

18:08.913 --> 18:10.480
Excuse me.

18:10.524 --> 18:11.916
Closed today.

18:11.960 --> 18:14.354
NCIS Agents Boone
and Holman.

18:14.397 --> 18:16.138
Anyone going in or out?

18:16.182 --> 18:18.314
No, 'cause we're closed.

18:18.358 --> 18:21.143
Well, maybe you noticed
something unusual?

18:21.187 --> 18:23.928
I don't usually have cops
asking me questions.

18:23.972 --> 18:25.582
We were just wondering

18:25.626 --> 18:29.238
if someone maybe got
access to the facility.

18:29.282 --> 18:31.675
Been here all day.
No one's come by.

18:31.719 --> 18:33.634
All day?

18:33.677 --> 18:34.983
Yeah. Why?

18:35.026 --> 18:36.376
Well, last I checked,

18:36.419 --> 18:37.986
Whaler's Sound
doesn't deliver.

18:40.293 --> 18:42.251
Ugh. Fine. You got me.

18:42.295 --> 18:44.775
I ran around the corner for some
shrimp, but the gate's locked.

18:44.819 --> 18:46.429
See?

18:46.473 --> 18:48.344
You said today was an off day?

18:48.388 --> 18:49.737
Uh-huh.

18:49.780 --> 18:52.392
Why is there smoke coming
from that chimney?

19:01.792 --> 19:03.838
Shut it down!

19:03.881 --> 19:05.231
[alarm sounding]

19:05.274 --> 19:06.319
[groans]

19:22.378 --> 19:24.467
Not much left, is there?

19:24.511 --> 19:25.773
Lucky we got anything at all.

19:25.816 --> 19:26.817
Yeah, a few more minutes

19:26.861 --> 19:28.341
in the incinerator,

19:28.384 --> 19:30.212
it would have
been all ash.That's actually a myth.

19:30.256 --> 19:31.387
Contrary to popular belief,

19:31.431 --> 19:33.476
burning a body
does not turn it to ash.

19:33.520 --> 19:35.565
You get more of a coarse sand

19:35.609 --> 19:37.350
with bone fragments,
sometimes teeth.

19:37.393 --> 19:38.873
That's, uh...

19:38.916 --> 19:41.180
good to know. [sniffles]

19:41.223 --> 19:43.573
Lye, gentlemen,
heated to 300 degrees.

19:43.617 --> 19:45.836
Soak a body for three hours.

19:45.880 --> 19:47.925
All that's left
is liquid.

19:47.969 --> 19:49.579
Or so I'm told.

19:49.623 --> 19:51.233
And the identity?

19:51.277 --> 19:53.714
Well, based off DNA
and the medical records,

19:53.757 --> 19:56.586
this is Kyle Jennings.

19:56.630 --> 19:58.588
Assuming you can't
tell us much more about him.

19:58.632 --> 20:00.808
As I said, you didn't give me
much to work with.

20:00.851 --> 20:02.462
But I can get a lot
from very little.

20:02.505 --> 20:04.942
Is there something specific
you're looking for?

20:04.986 --> 20:07.336
We believe Jennings
was incinerated

20:07.380 --> 20:09.120
because there may be
something on his body

20:09.164 --> 20:10.687
connected
to a cold case.

20:10.731 --> 20:13.386
Well, I did find high levels
of aluminum powder

20:13.429 --> 20:15.388
in the bone fragments.

20:15.431 --> 20:17.303
Oh, from the bullets
that killed him?No. Bullets are made

20:17.346 --> 20:19.305
of copper, lead
and steel, not aluminum.

20:19.348 --> 20:20.828
Yeah, quite right.

20:20.871 --> 20:22.656
Aluminum powder is
more often found in explosives.

20:22.699 --> 20:24.266
I took the liberty
of flipping through

20:24.310 --> 20:27.226
our victim's medical records
and found this chestnut.

20:27.269 --> 20:29.489
Dr. Eric Cutter,
trauma Surgeon.

20:29.532 --> 20:32.709
Last name's a bit on the nose
and also misleading,

20:32.753 --> 20:34.189
since he's pioneering
the use of magnets

20:34.233 --> 20:36.278
to remove shrapnel
from deep tissue.

20:36.322 --> 20:37.714
This report is
four years old.

20:37.758 --> 20:39.281
Apparently,
Jennings had a fragment

20:39.325 --> 20:41.327
lodged in his upper back.

20:41.370 --> 20:43.285
Dr. Cutter was prepared
to operate.

20:43.329 --> 20:45.200
Jennings disappeared
before he could.

20:45.244 --> 20:46.941
So we were right.

20:46.984 --> 20:49.030
Jennings was
the evidence.

20:50.901 --> 20:52.338
[lock beeps]

20:52.381 --> 20:55.428
All that food upstairs
made me want to order lunch.

20:56.864 --> 20:59.345
It looks like y'all already did.

20:59.388 --> 21:01.434
What? Oh, yeah.
We're good, Luce.

21:01.477 --> 21:03.784
Get anythingfor me?

21:06.961 --> 21:09.006
Ew.

21:11.226 --> 21:12.836
So what are you all doing?

21:12.880 --> 21:16.100
Computer simulation of
the munitions explosion.

21:16.144 --> 21:18.407
Lets us see
how accidental it was.

21:18.451 --> 21:20.235
If you'll do the honors.

21:20.279 --> 21:22.672
Mm. Thank you, my lad.

21:26.459 --> 21:28.461
Well,

21:28.504 --> 21:30.027
there you have it.

21:30.071 --> 21:31.464
I told you
we'd learn something.

21:31.507 --> 21:33.683
What did we learn?

21:33.727 --> 21:36.860
Munitions depot stored mainly
small arms ammunition.

21:36.904 --> 21:39.210
If the explosion had been
initiated by a faulty grenade,

21:39.254 --> 21:41.561
the blast would have
had a chain effect.

21:41.604 --> 21:43.606
A series of
smaller explosions.

21:43.650 --> 21:45.129
But this was a-a big boom.

21:45.173 --> 21:47.131
Initiated by some kind of

21:47.175 --> 21:49.743
primary charge
setting off high explosives.

21:49.786 --> 21:51.614
BOTH:
C-4.

21:54.835 --> 21:58.404
Okay, well,
C-4 wasn't on the inventory.

21:58.447 --> 22:00.623
Means someone
must have planted it.

22:00.667 --> 22:02.364
TENNANT:
We know the explosion

22:02.408 --> 22:04.671
of the munitions dump
was intentional.

22:04.714 --> 22:06.368
Set off
with some kind of IED

22:06.412 --> 22:08.283
that led to the death
of Corporal Menlo.

22:08.327 --> 22:10.241
And since Jennings was
the last man standing

22:10.285 --> 22:11.591
before the explosion...

22:11.634 --> 22:13.680
And had a piece of shrapnel
lodged in his back

22:13.723 --> 22:15.334
that was likely
part of the device...

22:15.377 --> 22:17.727
Looks like
he set the bomb.

22:17.771 --> 22:20.034
Okay, but why?

22:20.077 --> 22:22.166
It all comes back to Fortress.

22:22.210 --> 22:24.952
What do we know about them?

22:24.995 --> 22:28.042
Five years ago, they were
the plucky underdogs

22:28.085 --> 22:30.566
of the private contractor set.
Lean, mean,

22:30.610 --> 22:32.394
willing to handle security
in the hottest zones.

22:32.438 --> 22:34.440
No job too dirty.

22:34.483 --> 22:36.311
And it paid off.

22:36.355 --> 22:39.793
They've grown ten-fold over
the last few years, taking on

22:39.836 --> 22:42.099
multiple government
contracts with operations

22:42.143 --> 22:44.232
in a dozen locations,
including a training facility

22:44.275 --> 22:45.886
here on Oahu.

22:45.929 --> 22:48.105
All because of their CEO,
Brent Spooner.

22:48.149 --> 22:50.586
Mm. Another plucky underdog.

22:50.630 --> 22:52.675
Started as an operator
for Fortress

22:52.719 --> 22:54.416
and rose through the ranks

22:54.460 --> 22:56.200
to take over.

22:56.244 --> 22:58.246
SPOONER:
These are uncertain times.

22:58.289 --> 23:01.336
Security in the 21st century
requires complex response.

23:01.380 --> 23:03.425
How do we protect ourselves?

23:03.469 --> 23:05.862
Well, the answer is Fortress.

23:05.906 --> 23:08.387
Our personnel are highly-trained
and highly-motivated

23:08.430 --> 23:12.173
to assess threats
and implement harm reduction.

23:12.216 --> 23:14.393
Your security is our priority.

23:15.568 --> 23:16.917
Charming.

23:16.960 --> 23:19.746
In a post-apocalyptic,
paramilitary sort of way.

23:19.789 --> 23:21.487
All right.
What else do we know about him?

23:21.530 --> 23:24.141
He ran the Fortress mission
in Afghanistan

23:24.185 --> 23:25.926
when the explosion happened.

23:25.969 --> 23:28.450
He and his men were providing
ground security in the region.

23:28.494 --> 23:30.800
You think he was involved?JESSE:
I think he knows more

23:30.844 --> 23:32.411
than he said back then.

23:32.454 --> 23:34.369
I mean, whoever killed Jennings
had resources.

23:34.413 --> 23:35.805
Where is he now?

23:35.849 --> 23:37.372
KAI:
Fortress global headquarters
in Virginia.

23:37.416 --> 23:39.243
Torres could have
his team question him.

23:39.287 --> 23:41.245
We need to learn more
about him.

23:41.289 --> 23:42.725
And what Fortress was
into in Afghanistan.

23:42.769 --> 23:44.553
Easier said than done.

23:44.597 --> 23:46.425
They have thousands of employees

23:46.468 --> 23:48.209
working alongside military

23:48.252 --> 23:50.385
across the country,
including Pearl Harbor.

23:50.429 --> 23:51.778
What's your point?

23:51.821 --> 23:53.823
If they're willing
to ambush two federal agents

23:53.867 --> 23:55.651
and steal a body, they could
impede the investigation

23:55.695 --> 23:57.740
in other ways, too.

23:57.784 --> 24:00.482
I mean, it could be... could be
floating nearby right now.

24:00.526 --> 24:02.179
TENNANT:
Okay, a little paranoid,

24:02.223 --> 24:04.181
but point taken.

24:04.225 --> 24:06.096
Ernie, check badge swipes.

24:06.140 --> 24:08.577
See if anyone pops up
with a connection to Fortress.

24:08.621 --> 24:10.623
Kai?Yeah.

24:10.666 --> 24:12.668
Let's visit
their training facility.

24:12.712 --> 24:14.496
See what services they have.

24:14.540 --> 24:17.151
We just gonna walk in there
and announce ourselves?

24:17.194 --> 24:19.675
That's exactly
what we're gonna do.

24:20.850 --> 24:23.505
Sort of like
crashing a wedding, right?

24:23.549 --> 24:25.638
Don't know what you mean,
but sure.

24:26.900 --> 24:30.469
You got no game
at all, dude. [laughs]

24:33.776 --> 24:35.212
[overlapping chatter]

24:35.256 --> 24:36.910
HOLT:
Fortress Oahu is the premiere

24:36.953 --> 24:39.347
military training facility
in the Western hemisphere.

24:39.390 --> 24:41.218
We offer conditioning,
advanced tactics,

24:41.262 --> 24:43.264
and, of course,
SERE courses that rival

24:43.307 --> 24:45.005
any Tier One training.

24:45.048 --> 24:47.007
Impressive campus.

24:47.050 --> 24:48.530
Well, Brent had a vision.

24:48.574 --> 24:50.532
The Future of The
Future of Security.

24:50.576 --> 24:53.753
Sounds better when
Brent says it. [laughs]

24:53.796 --> 24:55.102
KAI:
The future

24:55.145 --> 24:57.060
of the future
looks expensive, Ms. Holt.

24:57.104 --> 24:58.845
Please, call me Tessa.

24:58.888 --> 25:00.934
You've come
at an exciting time.

25:00.977 --> 25:02.979
We're about to go public.
Brent's making

25:03.023 --> 25:04.764
the IPO announcement today.

25:04.807 --> 25:06.722
So the question is,

25:06.766 --> 25:09.420
how can Fortress enhance
your tactical requirements?

25:09.464 --> 25:12.293
Well, NCIS is looking
to outsource some assets

25:12.336 --> 25:14.774
for a sensitive
overseas operation.

25:14.817 --> 25:16.645
What kind of operation?

25:17.820 --> 25:19.256
Or can you not say?

25:19.300 --> 25:21.128
Let's keep it vague.

25:21.171 --> 25:23.957
But it's high risk, high reward.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.916
And we're particularly
interested in operators

25:26.960 --> 25:28.527
with experience in Afghanistan.

25:28.570 --> 25:31.834
I did a tour with the Marines
out of Bagram.

25:31.878 --> 25:34.489
I worked with some...
some top-notch

25:34.533 --> 25:36.186
Fortress guys
in the Central Highlands

25:36.230 --> 25:38.449
about five years ago, and I
would love to connect with them,

25:38.493 --> 25:40.103
since we have a shorthand.

25:40.147 --> 25:41.583
Do you have names?

25:41.627 --> 25:43.019
Kind of work we were doing,

25:43.063 --> 25:44.804
names didn't really come
into play.

25:44.847 --> 25:46.327
Understood.

25:46.370 --> 25:48.111
TENNANT: Can we get
a list of personnel

25:48.155 --> 25:50.244
who worked
the Central Highlands then?

25:50.287 --> 25:52.115
I'm sure you understand

25:52.159 --> 25:53.856
that discretion is one of the
founding principles at Fortress.

25:53.900 --> 25:55.815
Discretion is important
to us, too.

25:55.858 --> 25:58.600
Keeping the Navy's
secrets and all.

25:58.644 --> 26:01.560
We're not supposed to disclose
the names of employees.

26:01.603 --> 26:04.345
TENNANT:
I'll be honest.

26:04.388 --> 26:07.827
We're going on a limb bringing
in outside specialists for this,

26:07.870 --> 26:09.045
but it's for national security.

26:09.089 --> 26:11.265
Mm, big game hunting, Tessa.

26:11.308 --> 26:12.527
How big?

26:12.571 --> 26:15.138
The future of the future
depends on it.

26:23.016 --> 26:24.887
[exhales]

26:27.063 --> 26:29.588
This is every Fortress operator

26:29.631 --> 26:31.633
who worked in Afghanistan
five years ago.

26:31.677 --> 26:34.462
What am I supposed
to do with it?TORRES: Look through them.

26:34.505 --> 26:37.334
Find anyone you recognize
from munitions depot.

26:40.120 --> 26:42.165
[sighs]

26:44.820 --> 26:46.866
Uh...

26:47.867 --> 26:49.651
We were in-country.

26:49.695 --> 26:51.087
Beards and camo. These...

26:51.131 --> 26:52.611
These guys look
like Boy Scouts.

26:52.654 --> 26:54.308
Well, then, imagine them
with beards.

26:54.351 --> 26:55.614
This is your best shot?

26:55.657 --> 26:57.703
TENNANT:You were there, Greg.
We weren't.

26:57.746 --> 27:01.663
You'reour best shot at
identifying any other suspects.

27:01.707 --> 27:03.970
It was five years ago, and...

27:04.013 --> 27:06.059
I was a glorified
supply specialist.

27:06.102 --> 27:08.148
I can't just pick
'em out of a hat.

27:09.845 --> 27:11.891
You got to try.

27:12.935 --> 27:15.416
I literally gave up my life
to give you Jennings.

27:15.459 --> 27:17.984
He's all I had.
This is a waste of time!

27:18.027 --> 27:20.508
Wasn't for you,
there'd be no case.

27:20.551 --> 27:22.989
Corporal Menlo
would be forgotten.

27:23.032 --> 27:24.991
And now, because of you,

27:25.034 --> 27:27.950
two teams of
NCIS agents are going

27:27.994 --> 27:29.996
to bring his killers
to justice.

27:30.039 --> 27:31.998
And they're gonna give you
your life back.

27:33.652 --> 27:35.654
Greg.

27:40.528 --> 27:43.574
You got to just keep
pushing a little more.

27:43.618 --> 27:45.664
Look through the photos.

27:47.666 --> 27:49.885
TORRES:
And this time,

27:49.929 --> 27:52.235
we got you three lunches.

27:53.236 --> 27:54.760
[door closes]

27:54.803 --> 27:56.762
Okay.

27:56.805 --> 27:59.721
Give me some time.

28:01.070 --> 28:03.725
Boom-Boom's on assignment,
so I'm flying solo here.

28:03.769 --> 28:05.205
What's a Boom-Boom?

28:05.248 --> 28:07.163
He defies categorization, but

28:07.207 --> 28:09.209
I did do research on

28:09.252 --> 28:11.733
aluminum compounds used
in incendiary devices.

28:11.777 --> 28:13.909
Actually, not necessary.

28:13.953 --> 28:15.911
The history of priming
charges is fascinating.

28:15.955 --> 28:18.044
You know, Kasie is sort of

28:18.087 --> 28:19.872
a savant when it comes to...

28:19.915 --> 28:21.787
They're unique from the primers
used in firing pins

28:21.830 --> 28:23.745
or to initiate a rocket launch.

28:23.789 --> 28:26.879
Ernie...I get a little confused with

28:26.922 --> 28:28.619
time fuses versus
command fuses...

28:28.663 --> 28:29.925
[air horn blows]

28:31.884 --> 28:33.842
What was that for?

28:33.886 --> 28:37.846
Well, just making sure you got
your listening ears on, Burt.

28:37.890 --> 28:40.109
It's Ernie, and I was
just trying to...

28:40.153 --> 28:41.894
Demolition-splain.

28:41.937 --> 28:44.810
But there's no need to, 'cause
we already got the answer.

28:46.028 --> 28:48.030
Well, why didn't
you say so?

28:48.074 --> 28:50.990
The metal compound you retrieved
from Jennings' remains

28:51.033 --> 28:53.601
contains an aluminum base
which we know

28:53.644 --> 28:55.995
can conduct electrical current
to a primary charge.

28:56.038 --> 28:58.040
Common in most detonators.

28:58.084 --> 28:59.346
But what's less common

28:59.389 --> 29:01.348
is the gold nanoparticles

29:01.391 --> 29:03.045
I found in my analysis.

29:03.089 --> 29:04.786
Well, gold as in gold?

29:04.830 --> 29:07.049
It's malleable and ductile,

29:07.093 --> 29:10.574
making it extremely practical
in all kinds of engineering.

29:10.618 --> 29:12.272
Including bomb-making.

29:12.315 --> 29:14.665
Mm-hmm. It also reacts favorably

29:14.709 --> 29:16.972
to an optical
initiation device,

29:17.016 --> 29:19.105
which I'm fairly certain
you have here.

29:19.148 --> 29:23.022
Amazing, isn't it?This-this...
it's amazing.

29:23.065 --> 29:24.980
Uh, let's-let's pretend

29:25.024 --> 29:26.416
I still don't get it.

29:26.460 --> 29:28.418
Every bomb has a signature,

29:28.462 --> 29:30.725
and every bomb maker leaves
identifying factors

29:30.769 --> 29:32.292
in his or her design.

29:32.335 --> 29:35.034
And an optical
initiation device...

29:35.077 --> 29:36.557
Is very rare.

29:36.600 --> 29:39.995
Making it easier for us
to figure out who made the bomb.

29:40.039 --> 29:44.565
If we confirm this detonator
came from a Fortress operator...

29:44.608 --> 29:46.219
We can tie them

29:46.262 --> 29:48.177
to the murder of Corporal Menlo.

29:48.221 --> 29:50.136
We have one of their
munitions experts upstairs.

29:50.179 --> 29:51.964
Maybe ask him.

29:52.007 --> 29:54.662
And here I thought
Burt was the smart one.

29:57.099 --> 29:59.754
Do you think Greg
will be able to ID

29:59.798 --> 30:01.538
what kind of detonator
Fortress uses?

30:01.582 --> 30:03.584
Well, according to his file,
he helped design them.

30:03.627 --> 30:05.238
Nice to officially
meet you, by the way.

30:05.281 --> 30:07.109
Torres tells me
good things.

30:07.153 --> 30:09.242
What kind of things?

30:09.285 --> 30:10.809
Work things.

30:10.852 --> 30:12.462
I swear.

30:14.160 --> 30:16.336
Where is he?
Restroom?

30:16.379 --> 30:18.991
Kitchen?

30:19.034 --> 30:21.863
Tennant, do you have the
authority to lock down the base?

30:21.907 --> 30:23.822
Yeah.

30:23.865 --> 30:25.824
You might want to do it now.

30:25.867 --> 30:27.390
Fortress got to him.

30:27.434 --> 30:29.392
He's gone.

30:37.531 --> 30:38.793
What do we know about Greg?

30:38.837 --> 30:40.577
He used a phone in the bullpen
and made a call

30:40.621 --> 30:42.057
to his sister's house
in New Mexico.

30:42.101 --> 30:44.494
90 seconds later,
slipped out of the building.

30:44.538 --> 30:45.844
And do we know
who delivered that food?

30:45.887 --> 30:47.149
We're working
on finding out.

30:47.193 --> 30:49.238
Tell me
Greg is still on the base.

30:49.282 --> 30:50.718
Best we figure,

30:50.761 --> 30:52.720
he joined a tour group
that was leaving.

30:52.763 --> 30:54.983
Torres is trying
to track the group down.

30:55.027 --> 30:56.680
We need the Albuquerque police
to check in on Greg's sister.

30:56.724 --> 30:58.291
Already did.

30:58.334 --> 31:00.989
She's not at her house.
No idea where she went.

31:01.033 --> 31:03.774
It's Fortress, right?
They got to his sister.

31:03.818 --> 31:05.211
They compelled him to leave.

31:05.254 --> 31:07.169
Probably gave him instructions
on where to meet.

31:07.213 --> 31:08.997
Wherever it is,
he's walking into a trap.

31:09.041 --> 31:11.304
Greg left us something
before he disappeared.

31:11.347 --> 31:14.829
These are the Fortress operators
in Afghanistan five years ago.

31:14.873 --> 31:16.875
He circled three photos.

31:20.835 --> 31:22.793
KNIGHT:Honestly, Nick,
we're just in the basement.

31:22.837 --> 31:24.143
You couldn't walk
a flight of stairs?

31:24.186 --> 31:27.059
Relax. I'm still
at the guard gate waiting

31:27.102 --> 31:28.930
for info on the tour group
that Greg left with.

31:28.974 --> 31:30.845
What do we know
about the men he ID'd?

31:30.889 --> 31:33.761
Uh, they worked directly with
Kyle Jennings five years ago.

31:33.804 --> 31:36.807
All part of a security mission
in the Central Highlands.

31:36.851 --> 31:38.722
Marine Recon unit
was clearing out local militias

31:38.766 --> 31:40.376
from the provinces.

31:40.420 --> 31:42.683
These guys were securing
the villages afterwards.

31:42.726 --> 31:44.990
Corporal Menlo's unit?ERNIE: Yes.

31:45.033 --> 31:46.730
They cleared and secured
a dozen villages,

31:46.774 --> 31:48.732
but one stands out.

31:48.776 --> 31:50.473
Took down a militia stronghold.

31:50.517 --> 31:52.388
Found a cache of
stolen U.S. currency.

31:52.432 --> 31:54.869
Wait. I can't see.
What are we looking at?

31:54.913 --> 31:56.871
A crapload of cash.

31:56.915 --> 31:58.133
If I'm eyeballing it...

31:58.177 --> 31:59.918
$75 million?

31:59.961 --> 32:02.355
I guessed 72.[gasps] Hey.

32:02.398 --> 32:03.617
[laughing]:
Hey to you, too.[laughs]

32:03.660 --> 32:05.967
But according
to the official records,

32:06.011 --> 32:08.404
only 30 million was delivered
to the Bagram Air Base.

32:08.448 --> 32:10.754
You want to guess whose job
it was to deliver the money?

32:10.798 --> 32:12.495
Fortress.

32:12.539 --> 32:14.367
Kyle Jennings and his three
buddies are in this photo.

32:14.410 --> 32:16.064
Corporal Menlo, too.

32:16.108 --> 32:18.066
Menlo realizes
these guys stole the money,

32:18.110 --> 32:19.502
but before he can report it,

32:19.546 --> 32:21.765
they sabotage
the munitions depot.

32:21.809 --> 32:24.420
Yeah. Jennings set up the bomb,
but got caught up in the blast.

32:24.464 --> 32:26.205
He was a loose end.

32:26.248 --> 32:28.424
And that leaves Greg, and
he's still nowhere to be found.

32:28.468 --> 32:31.036
Stealing 40 million in cash and
getting out of Afghanistan--

32:31.079 --> 32:32.689
that requires
a lot of logistics.

32:32.733 --> 32:35.779
Along with making sure the bomb
looked like an accident.

32:35.823 --> 32:39.044
One other person of note
is in this photo.

32:41.089 --> 32:43.352
Brent Spooner,

32:43.396 --> 32:44.963
Fortress's CEO.

32:45.006 --> 32:47.966
And he was personally
responsible

32:48.009 --> 32:50.446
for getting the cash
back to Bagram.

32:50.490 --> 32:51.839
Yeah. All right, thanks.

32:51.882 --> 32:53.754
All three
of our Fortress operators

32:53.797 --> 32:55.451
are here on the island.

32:55.495 --> 32:57.453
They arrived within
a couple of hours of Torres.

32:57.497 --> 32:59.151
Oh, they were monitoring me
somehow.

32:59.194 --> 33:01.109
And by now, they'll have Greg,
and try to figure out

33:01.153 --> 33:03.546
how much he told us,
then kill him.

33:03.590 --> 33:05.984
Oh. Where would they take him?

33:06.027 --> 33:07.724
KAI:
It's got to be somewhere safe

33:07.768 --> 33:10.727
from prying eyes
where they can interrogate him.

33:10.771 --> 33:13.034
Fortress compound
is a perfect spot.

33:13.078 --> 33:14.514
It's remote, secure.

33:14.557 --> 33:15.994
And it's empty.

33:16.037 --> 33:18.039
The entire Fortress
organization will be

33:18.083 --> 33:20.041
at the viewing of Brent
Spooner's IPO announcement.

33:20.085 --> 33:21.956
Lucy and Knight
are already on their way.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.305
Let's go meet 'em.

33:24.306 --> 33:26.743
Listen, Torres?Mm.

33:26.787 --> 33:28.745
I promised Knight I wouldn't
let you get shot at again.

33:28.789 --> 33:30.399
Oh, it's all good.

33:30.443 --> 33:32.445
I'll just hide
behind your tall one.

33:32.488 --> 33:34.316
Not all good for me.

33:34.360 --> 33:35.970
Through the entirety
of history,

33:36.014 --> 33:39.060
civilization has needed
stalwart defenders.

33:39.104 --> 33:43.238
The Spartan hoplite, the Roman
centurion, the Japanese samurai.

33:43.282 --> 33:47.199
Today, Fortress take its place
amongst this noble tradition,

33:47.242 --> 33:49.070
offering superior stability

33:49.114 --> 33:51.725
at an unprecedented
market share.

33:51.768 --> 33:54.728
Because we are going public.

33:54.771 --> 33:57.383
And the world will never
be the same.

33:57.426 --> 33:59.037
Kai, Lucy, heading
into the training area.

33:59.080 --> 34:00.212
Interrogation chambers are

34:00.255 --> 34:01.735
on the far end of the grounds.

34:01.778 --> 34:03.432
Copy that, boss.
Got you covered.

34:14.052 --> 34:16.315
Just saw one
of our suspects go in.

34:16.358 --> 34:18.317
[whispering]:
Let's go.

34:40.556 --> 34:43.603
What's our move here, boss?

34:43.646 --> 34:44.734
Guess I'll just hide behind you

34:44.778 --> 34:46.562
for a while, like Torres said.

34:46.606 --> 34:48.608
[laughs breathlessly]

34:48.651 --> 34:51.959
Kai, shooter's
on the far right ridge.

34:54.831 --> 34:56.137
LUCY:
Got him.

34:56.181 --> 34:57.704
Heading in.

34:57.747 --> 35:00.446
You know, you could, uh,
tell me what really happened

35:00.489 --> 35:02.274
in Orlando
to pass the time.

35:02.317 --> 35:04.363
[rapid gunfire]

35:06.669 --> 35:11.109
Torres, Greg's in the chamber
with at least one suspect.

35:12.197 --> 35:14.155
I'm all over it.

35:14.199 --> 35:16.114
Federal agents!

35:18.072 --> 35:20.553
Shooter down. We're clear.

35:20.596 --> 35:22.555
Get back!

35:31.346 --> 35:33.087
[laughing]

35:34.741 --> 35:36.960
What's so funny?

35:37.004 --> 35:39.920
[laughs softly]
Batman.

35:43.576 --> 35:46.753
[grunting]

35:55.718 --> 35:57.372
You guys good?

35:57.416 --> 35:59.592
That's a good shot.Yeah. Thanks for that.

35:59.635 --> 36:01.246
Where's Torres?

36:01.289 --> 36:03.552
[grunting]

36:05.380 --> 36:08.644
[loud grunting]

36:13.258 --> 36:14.824
Whoa! Sorry.

36:14.868 --> 36:16.435
Gonna need you alive.

36:19.612 --> 36:22.354
[handcuffs clicking]

36:22.397 --> 36:24.878
That was awesome.You doing all right, Greg?

36:24.921 --> 36:28.273
Um, you know, definitely not.

36:28.316 --> 36:30.797
Plus,
they gave me a lot of drugs.

36:30.840 --> 36:33.103
Well, we're gonna
get you out of here.

36:33.147 --> 36:35.149
Hey, my sister--

36:35.193 --> 36:37.195
what about her?TENNANT:
Don't worry.

36:37.238 --> 36:39.197
We have contacts in New Mexico.

36:39.240 --> 36:40.981
We're gonna find her.

36:41.024 --> 36:42.461
[sighs]

36:45.420 --> 36:47.466
TORRES:
Let's go.

36:50.991 --> 36:52.993
TENNANT: Here we are.

36:53.036 --> 36:54.647
SUSPECT: What is this?

36:54.690 --> 36:56.083
This is your
crossroads.

36:56.126 --> 36:57.258
You're about to make
the biggest choice of your life.

36:57.302 --> 36:58.999
You choose to talk,

36:59.042 --> 37:01.262
tell us everything about
Corporal Menlo's murder,

37:01.306 --> 37:03.917
the cash you stole,
Kyle Jennings,

37:03.960 --> 37:06.136
Brent Spooner's
role in all this.

37:07.312 --> 37:09.618
I got nothing to say.Mm.

37:09.662 --> 37:13.840
Or you can choose
not to talk.

37:13.883 --> 37:17.626
We uncuff you, let you go.

37:20.586 --> 37:22.152
He's wondering
what the catch is.

37:22.196 --> 37:23.589
Just give him a beat.
He hasn't worked it out yet.

37:23.632 --> 37:24.764
Mm-hmm.

37:26.679 --> 37:28.289
You'll toss me off the cliff?

37:28.333 --> 37:29.638
TORRES:
Mm.
No.

37:29.682 --> 37:31.640
No. No, sir.

37:31.684 --> 37:33.686
We're gonna let you go.

37:33.729 --> 37:35.470
Because there's absolutely
nothing worse

37:35.514 --> 37:36.950
that we can do to you

37:36.993 --> 37:38.647
than what Spooner will

37:38.691 --> 37:40.867
when he finds out
you're free.

37:40.910 --> 37:43.130
He's gonna assume you talked.TORRES:
Or he's gonna assume

37:43.173 --> 37:44.610
we're following you,
and at that point,

37:44.653 --> 37:46.220
it will be too risky
to let you live.

37:46.264 --> 37:48.222
You'll end up like Jennings
and Greg, living in the shadows,

37:48.266 --> 37:50.268
always looking
over your shoulder.TORRES: Yeah.

37:50.311 --> 37:52.226
With a big target on your back
the rest of your life.

37:52.270 --> 37:54.402
Which won't be much.No, I mean,

37:54.446 --> 37:56.709
I'd give him about a month
before he gets tracked down.

37:56.752 --> 37:57.710
Nah.

37:57.753 --> 37:59.494
I feel less optimistic.Less?

37:59.538 --> 38:01.104
Mm-hmm.No.

38:01.148 --> 38:02.976
Yeah.All right, well,
let's take

38:03.019 --> 38:05.370
those cuffs off, and you know,
maybe you can prove us wrong.

38:05.413 --> 38:07.328
Wait. Wait.

38:08.982 --> 38:11.419
I'll talk.That's a good choice.

38:23.344 --> 38:24.867
[grunts]

38:24.911 --> 38:26.869
Get me to the airfield now.

38:26.913 --> 38:28.306
Yeah.

38:29.307 --> 38:30.351
Yeah, I need you to clear
my schedule

38:30.395 --> 38:31.657
for the rest of the week.

38:31.700 --> 38:33.006
Yeah,
I know we're booked solid.

38:33.049 --> 38:34.486
Just do it.

38:34.529 --> 38:36.879
Make sure
the jet's ready to go.

38:36.923 --> 38:38.881
Yeah, I'll tell the pilot the
destination when I get there.

38:38.925 --> 38:40.405
I'm thinking

38:40.448 --> 38:42.058
one of the Gulf states.

38:42.102 --> 38:45.497
Uh, Saudi Arabia is nice
this time of year, maybe Brunei.

38:45.540 --> 38:47.934
Neither one has, uh,
extradition to the U.S.

38:47.977 --> 38:49.414
Uh, who the hell are you?

38:49.457 --> 38:51.285
Honestly, though,

38:51.329 --> 38:53.113
that dry heat is gonna be
brutal on the pores.

38:53.156 --> 38:55.289
Maybe the Ivory Coast
instead. I don't know.

38:55.333 --> 38:57.900
I'm just spitballing here.

38:57.944 --> 38:59.946
Let me out of the car.

38:59.989 --> 39:01.991
Uh, kind of a moot point
now, since, uh,

39:02.035 --> 39:04.254
there's been a change
in your itinerary.

39:04.298 --> 39:06.561
Where are you taking me?

39:06.605 --> 39:08.476
NCIS Headquarters.

39:08.520 --> 39:11.305
[laughs]

39:11.349 --> 39:13.568
What... what-what is this?

39:13.612 --> 39:16.441
This is what happens
when you steal $40 million

39:16.484 --> 39:19.182
from the U.S. government
and kill a Marine.

39:21.533 --> 39:23.796
Oh, no, I know that look.

39:23.839 --> 39:26.189
You feel like
the best day

39:26.233 --> 39:29.323
in your life just turned
into the worst, but

39:29.367 --> 39:33.414
I promise you...

39:33.458 --> 39:35.460
there are worse days to come.

39:41.117 --> 39:43.206
You can get out now.

39:44.207 --> 39:45.557
[doors unlock]

39:51.737 --> 39:53.695
Just talked to the
Albuquerque police.

39:53.739 --> 39:56.045
Your sister got grabbed
off the street by a couple

39:56.089 --> 39:57.482
of Fortress operators,

39:57.525 --> 39:59.397
locked in a roadside motel.

39:59.440 --> 40:01.573
TORRES:The cops found her
safe and sound.

40:01.616 --> 40:04.967
Obviously, a little shaken up
when she heard that, uh,

40:05.011 --> 40:07.405
you were still alive.

40:08.928 --> 40:10.843
She's waiting for you back home.

40:10.886 --> 40:12.410
So, that-that means...

40:12.453 --> 40:13.976
TORRES:
No more running.

40:14.020 --> 40:16.326
No more campsites.

40:16.370 --> 40:17.763
[sobs]

40:17.806 --> 40:20.418
You're free
to be alive again.

40:22.289 --> 40:25.379
I-I don't know how
to thank you. Um...

40:25.423 --> 40:28.034
Listen...

40:28.077 --> 40:30.166
we're the ones
that should thank you, Greg.

40:31.907 --> 40:34.257
You kept this case alive.

40:34.301 --> 40:36.477
I have an agent outside who will
help set up your travel.

40:38.087 --> 40:39.524
Thank you.

40:44.224 --> 40:47.140
[laughing]:
Okay. Okay.

40:47.183 --> 40:48.837
All right, man.

40:48.881 --> 40:50.622
You better go.

40:55.975 --> 40:58.064
Guess you got to go, too.

40:59.065 --> 41:01.633
Yeah, I think so.

41:03.199 --> 41:04.984
But two things.

41:05.027 --> 41:08.640
One-- sorry about that
T'N'T thing out there. Mm.

41:08.683 --> 41:10.119
[chuckles softly]

41:10.163 --> 41:13.601
And two-- uh,

41:13.645 --> 41:15.603
that was fun.

41:15.647 --> 41:17.605
Almost getting
killed together?

41:17.649 --> 41:19.607
Twice?

41:19.651 --> 41:22.131
Well, I mean, it's not
getting trapped on the top

41:22.175 --> 41:25.526
of the Citrus Tower for a night,
but, uh, hey, it'll do.

41:28.224 --> 41:30.575
Listen.

41:30.618 --> 41:32.577
What happened in Orlando...

41:32.620 --> 41:34.666
It will stay in Orlando.

41:36.842 --> 41:38.539
See ya, Nick.

41:42.891 --> 41:44.937
See you, Jane.

41:52.031 --> 41:54.381
All right, you have
my work cell, my personal cell

41:54.424 --> 41:56.470
and my other cell here.Got it.

41:56.514 --> 41:59.299
And you still owe me
that five-layer dip recipe.

41:59.342 --> 42:01.693
Oh, it's so bad,
but it's so good.

42:01.736 --> 42:03.869
JESSE:All right, wrap it up.
We got a schedule

42:03.912 --> 42:06.088
to keep here.Oh. Flight's not
for a few hours.

42:06.132 --> 42:07.916
Yeah, we have a bit
of a detour.

42:07.960 --> 42:09.527
Want to make sure
you get the most

42:09.570 --> 42:11.616
out of your Hawai'i experience.

42:11.659 --> 42:13.400
Well,
from what I've seen so far,

42:13.443 --> 42:15.054
it is mostly government
buildings and shoot-outs.

42:15.097 --> 42:16.708
LUCY:Mm-hmm.

42:16.751 --> 42:18.492
But totally cool. [laughs]

42:18.536 --> 42:20.538
Well, that is gonna change.

42:20.581 --> 42:22.452
Yeah, we're gonna give you
the nickel tour.

42:22.496 --> 42:24.019
All right,
but we better move fast

42:24.063 --> 42:25.499
if we want to catch sunset
on the beach.

42:25.543 --> 42:26.979
Ah.

42:27.022 --> 42:29.068
