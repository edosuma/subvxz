(laughs)
Like a rat to the bait, Freeman.

09:58.556 --> 10:01.475
Predictable as always.
(laughs)

10:01.559 --> 10:03.644
-Who is this marauder, Captain?
-I don't know.

10:03.728 --> 10:07.023
I am Vindicta,
vengeance personified!

10:07.106 --> 10:08.816
At last, Freeman.

10:08.899 --> 10:11.235
I will bathe in your blood.

10:11.319 --> 10:13.529
Oh, boy, somebody's
really laying it on thick.

10:13.612 --> 10:16.532
Behold my three henchmen
of the apo...

10:16.615 --> 10:18.409
of the Vin-pocalypse.

10:18.492 --> 10:21.370
Tendi, my savage warrior queen

10:21.454 --> 10:26.167
who comes from a long line
of thieving Orion pirates.

10:26.250 --> 10:28.627
(clears throat)
Yeah, nobody messes with Orions.

10:28.711 --> 10:31.714
I'll steal from anyone
and never give it back. Theft!

10:31.797 --> 10:33.215
And, uh,

10:33.299 --> 10:34.592
B-Bionic 5,

10:34.675 --> 10:37.678
half man-meat,
half robot-meat, all pain.

10:37.762 --> 10:39.889
100% pain.

10:39.972 --> 10:44.018
Tremble at the sight
of the great Vindicta!

10:44.101 --> 10:45.728
And Shempo.

10:45.811 --> 10:48.898
I'm Shempo. I was supposed
to be played by Boimler.

10:48.981 --> 10:50.733
Okay, come on.
I don't sound like that.

10:50.816 --> 10:53.361
I love my captain, and I don't
want to be doing this.

10:53.444 --> 10:55.112
All right,
that's not too far off.

10:55.196 --> 10:57.365
You're posing as Starfleet. Why?

10:57.448 --> 10:59.950
Because I do what I want!
Ugh, you're a jerk, Freeman.

11:00.034 --> 11:02.203
You're nothing
but a propped up errand girl,

11:02.286 --> 11:05.706
blindly licking Starfleet's boot
and begging for heel.

11:05.790 --> 11:07.792
Oh! Vindicta got your ass.

11:07.875 --> 11:10.252
Look, there's no need
for theatrics, all right?

11:10.336 --> 11:13.255
-I'm sure you're a reasonable...
-Shempo got you tea, master.

11:13.339 --> 11:15.591
This is coffee!

11:15.674 --> 11:17.426
I was Shempo.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.095
-(all gasp)
-That poor Shempo!

11:19.178 --> 11:21.430
You didn't have to do that.
Are you out of your mind?

11:21.514 --> 11:23.641
Freeman, you disgust me.

11:23.724 --> 11:25.893
You're a coward
who hides behind rank.

11:25.976 --> 11:27.269
You can't even appreciate

11:27.353 --> 11:29.021
your most valuable,
creative thinkers.

11:29.105 --> 11:31.273
I am Vindicta! Today you die.

11:31.357 --> 11:33.442
This Vindicta
is all over the place.

11:33.526 --> 11:35.444
"Hell is empty,
and all the devils are here.

11:35.528 --> 11:37.863
Our revels now are ended."

11:37.947 --> 11:39.907
Wait,
is she quoting The Tempest?

11:43.536 --> 11:45.454
"Hell is empty,
and all the devils are...

11:45.538 --> 11:47.123
"Hell is empty,
and all the devils

11:47.206 --> 11:48.457
-are here."
-FREEMAN: Wait,
this is a recording.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.126
It's a distraction.

11:50.209 --> 11:51.585
(gasps)
Winger?

11:51.669 --> 11:53.254
Hi. I'm Lieutenant Lemonts.

11:53.337 --> 11:55.673
Your one-man show
took my breath away.

11:55.756 --> 11:57.091
(chuckles)
Thank you. Thank...

11:57.174 --> 11:58.259
(screams)

12:00.719 --> 12:01.762
(laughs)

12:01.846 --> 12:02.805
(screams)

12:02.888 --> 12:05.307
Freeman! Bring me Free...

12:06.350 --> 12:08.853
-(alarm blaring)
-God, these stupid capes.
So much fabric.

12:08.936 --> 12:10.396
(grunting)

12:12.523 --> 12:15.276
Bring me Freeman,
and I'll let you live.

12:15.359 --> 12:16.610
Never, witch!

12:16.694 --> 12:18.279
(grunting)

12:18.362 --> 12:19.655
RUTHERFORD:
Wow.

12:19.738 --> 12:20.948
Boimler did a good job.

12:21.031 --> 12:22.324
Chief Lundy's accent
was spot-on.

12:22.408 --> 12:24.160
Yeah, and the way his face
was all blotchy?

12:24.243 --> 12:26.662
-Wait, do you think
Billups is in here?
-Eh, probably.

12:26.745 --> 12:28.998
So I can say
whatever I want to my boss

12:29.081 --> 12:30.875
with no consequences?

12:30.958 --> 12:33.002
(laughing)

12:33.085 --> 12:35.629
-Hey, wait! We have to hench!
-Tendi, come on.

12:35.713 --> 12:37.131
Pirate it up. Take some slaves.

12:37.214 --> 12:40.301
Oh, uh, you know the whole
"Orions taking slaves" thing?

12:40.384 --> 12:42.344
It's not something
I really like to...

12:42.428 --> 12:44.013
-Dirty Orion.
-(Tendi gasps)

12:44.096 --> 12:45.014
Lundy!

12:45.097 --> 12:48.225
-(screams)
-(laughs)

12:48.309 --> 12:51.020
Give me Freeman!
(laughs)

12:51.103 --> 12:53.522
Attack formation Raptor.

12:53.606 --> 12:55.357
This isn't my first
overpowered space warlord,

12:55.441 --> 12:57.359
and it won't be my last.

12:57.443 --> 12:59.361
(grunting)

12:59.445 --> 13:01.655
(laughs) Ransom,
you think you're better than me?

13:01.739 --> 13:03.699
Better at being
the captain's little dick wig.

13:03.782 --> 13:05.868
You can talk the talk,
but can you... Ow!

13:05.951 --> 13:07.536
-(Mariner laughing)
-Walk the walk! She can do both!

13:07.620 --> 13:09.538
-Oh, she's walkin' and talkin'.
-Sir, quick,

13:09.622 --> 13:11.707
-what's the captain's
favorite type of cookie?
-What?!

13:11.790 --> 13:13.417
Tell me
before you succumb to the pain.

13:13.501 --> 13:14.710
If I were to bake her cookies,

13:14.793 --> 13:16.879
-what would be my best bet?
-(coughs)

13:16.962 --> 13:19.256
Cap's got a sweet tooth.
Cookies are a good move.

13:19.340 --> 13:21.383
I've done it myself.
But watch out.

13:21.467 --> 13:23.385
She's allergic to...
(grunts)

13:23.469 --> 13:24.678
(laughs)

13:24.762 --> 13:26.180
Allergic to what? Ransom!

13:26.263 --> 13:28.766
Allergic to what?!

13:28.849 --> 13:30.184
At your stations, people.

13:30.267 --> 13:31.560
This is not a drill.

13:31.644 --> 13:34.438
Billups! Show yourself!

13:34.522 --> 13:35.689
Sir, get down!
(grunts)

13:35.773 --> 13:37.775
(panting, grunting)

13:39.985 --> 13:41.028
Engineering, evacuate!

13:44.114 --> 13:45.866
Andy Billups!

13:45.950 --> 13:48.911
You think you're
the best engineer in the fleet.

13:48.994 --> 13:50.579
Well, I've wanted
to say something to you

13:50.663 --> 13:52.957
for a long time.

13:53.040 --> 13:54.833
You are the best engineer
in the fleet!

13:54.917 --> 13:57.253
-Huh?
-I love how
you program subroutines.

13:57.336 --> 13:58.420
It's breathtaking.

13:58.504 --> 14:00.714
It feels so good to say it.

14:00.798 --> 14:02.716
COMPUTER:
Warning. Hydron levels critical.

14:02.800 --> 14:04.260
Damn it!
We don't have much time.

14:04.343 --> 14:06.595
Rerouting the vent system
would take a whole team.

14:06.679 --> 14:08.097
If we bypass the indacontrols

14:08.180 --> 14:09.223
and suppress the sativents,

14:09.306 --> 14:10.599
it should function as a...

14:10.683 --> 14:12.434
BOTH:
Rudimentary plasma filter.

14:12.518 --> 14:15.563
(laughs) Wow,
for a random space marauder,

14:15.646 --> 14:17.648
you really know your way
around a starship.

14:17.731 --> 14:19.066
Aw, thanks.

14:20.067 --> 14:21.819
SHAXS:
Intruder!

14:22.820 --> 14:24.113
When you get to hell,

14:24.196 --> 14:26.115
tell the Pah-wraiths
that Shaxs sent you!

14:26.198 --> 14:28.951
Special delivery
straight from Bajor!

14:29.994 --> 14:31.120
Ah, shut up.

14:37.209 --> 14:38.961
(grunts)

14:39.044 --> 14:40.963
(groans)
Borg head?

14:41.046 --> 14:43.340
-Designation: explosive.
-(beeping)

14:44.341 --> 14:46.468
(groans)

14:46.552 --> 14:48.137
-(whimpers)
-Oh, look!

14:48.220 --> 14:50.347
Oh, Shaxs's earring.
You have to wear it.

14:50.431 --> 14:52.016
-Come here. Come here.
-Uh, I-I don't know.

14:52.099 --> 14:53.309
Isn't there, like,
religious significance?

14:53.392 --> 14:55.102
I mean,
some of his ear's still on it.

14:55.185 --> 14:56.937
Come on, dude.
Orions are pirates!

14:57.021 --> 14:57.938
Pillaging's your whole thing.

14:58.022 --> 15:00.816
Okay, stop!
It is not my whole thing.

15:00.899 --> 15:03.152
And for your information,
many Orions haven't been pirates

15:03.235 --> 15:04.945
for over five years!

15:05.029 --> 15:08.157
Okay, sorry. Look, you can just
be my generic warrior henchman.

15:08.240 --> 15:10.326
Come on! Come on,
let's go torture the cat doctor.

15:10.409 --> 15:11.910
Like, really torture
the hell out of her.

15:11.994 --> 15:13.454
Her name is Dr. T'Ana.

15:13.537 --> 15:16.123
You're way too into this.
This is messed up.

15:16.206 --> 15:18.000
MARINER:
It's the holodeck.
It's not real.

15:18.083 --> 15:20.002
-(man screams)
-Die! Die!

15:20.085 --> 15:21.795
(both grunt)

15:21.879 --> 15:24.548
What is with you today?
This is not healthy.

15:24.632 --> 15:26.175
-Can we stop the movie?
-No!

15:26.258 --> 15:27.676
No, I'm fine.
This is feeling good.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.011
Come on, let me
just take down the captain,

15:29.094 --> 15:30.012
and then we can grab tacos.

15:30.095 --> 15:32.181
I don't want to watch you
phaser the captain.

15:32.264 --> 15:34.016
Phaser?
(laughs)

15:34.099 --> 15:37.227
Oh, it's going to be way worse
than that.

15:37.311 --> 15:39.647
I am out of here. Arch.

15:39.730 --> 15:41.523
MARINER:
Hey, come on.

15:41.607 --> 15:43.150
This isn't you.

15:43.233 --> 15:44.610
It is, too!

15:45.611 --> 15:48.030
(shouts)

15:48.113 --> 15:50.741
Ransom. Shaxs. Anyone, come in.

15:50.824 --> 15:52.493
(man screams)

15:52.576 --> 15:55.537
No one left to hide behind,
Captain.

15:55.621 --> 15:58.374
It's just me and you.

15:58.457 --> 15:59.833
And-and these guys.

15:59.917 --> 16:01.919
(both scream)

16:04.213 --> 16:05.589
You'll never take my ship.

16:05.673 --> 16:07.216
I don't want your ship.

16:07.299 --> 16:09.218
I want you to stop treating me

16:09.301 --> 16:10.761
like I'm the bad guy
all the time.

16:10.844 --> 16:12.054
You are the bad guy.

16:12.137 --> 16:14.723
No, I'm not.
Why don't you ever side with me?

16:14.807 --> 16:16.183
I don't even know you.

16:16.266 --> 16:17.726
Exactly!

16:17.810 --> 16:20.396
Oh, my God. You're-you're crazy.

16:20.479 --> 16:23.273
-No, this is crazy.
-(beeping)

16:23.357 --> 16:25.067
Sir, her ship.

16:25.150 --> 16:27.277
-The warp core's gone critical.
-Brace for impact!

16:29.279 --> 16:30.572
(laughs)

17:01.019 --> 17:02.604
-(alarm blaring)
-COMPUTER: Warning. Warning.

17:02.688 --> 17:06.275
-(groans)
-The ship has crashed. Warning.

17:11.697 --> 17:13.949
(grunts)
Oh, damn it.

17:14.032 --> 17:16.201
-(electrical crackling)
-(groans)

17:16.285 --> 17:18.787
All surviving crew,
emergency evacuation protocol:

17:18.871 --> 17:20.789
Delta Echo.

17:20.873 --> 17:23.167
I'll keep systems functional
for as long as possible.

17:23.250 --> 17:25.919
You can do this.
We can do this.

17:26.003 --> 17:27.629
-Cerritos strong! (groans)
-(loud crackling)

17:27.713 --> 17:29.423
Oh, when are you going
to give up

17:29.506 --> 17:31.633
-the "loving captain" act?
-It's not an act!

17:31.717 --> 17:33.510
I'm overflowing
with love and affection!

17:33.594 --> 17:35.512
-Oh, shut up!
-You shut up!

17:37.890 --> 17:39.433
Sir, are you okay?

17:39.516 --> 17:40.809
I'll live,

17:40.893 --> 17:43.145
-but the rest of the crew...
-Will be fine.

17:43.228 --> 17:45.939
I initiated a rapid repeating
emergency transport sequence

17:46.023 --> 17:47.983
and beamed the entire crew
before we crashed.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.443
What? But that's not possible.

17:49.526 --> 17:50.944
No, it's a movie.
You can beam whatever you want.

17:51.028 --> 17:52.780
You can do all sorts
of beaming stuff in a movie!

17:52.863 --> 17:54.323
What?! That is amazing!

17:54.406 --> 17:56.617
-I learned it from you, sir.
-Uh... okay.

17:56.700 --> 18:00.162
(grunting)

18:00.245 --> 18:02.122
-(laughing)
-(groaning)

18:05.793 --> 18:07.669
What is your problem?!

18:07.753 --> 18:09.338
You've been a jerk
since I was eight!

18:09.421 --> 18:11.465
Why do you have
to be so hard on me?!

18:11.548 --> 18:13.509
What? I don't know you!

18:13.592 --> 18:16.345
(grunting)

18:16.428 --> 18:18.305
(growling)

18:19.473 --> 18:21.517
(both grunting)

18:26.188 --> 18:28.148
(groaning)

18:34.571 --> 18:36.240
(laughing)

18:39.535 --> 18:42.663
Get off my mom, you bitch.

18:42.746 --> 18:45.541
-(both grunting)
-Oh! Wait. What?

18:45.624 --> 18:48.252
You simulated me in here, too?
Not cool, man!

18:48.335 --> 18:50.546
I got private stuff
in those logs!

18:50.629 --> 18:53.215
Emergency transport
on signal now!

18:53.298 --> 18:54.591
Beckett, no!

18:56.134 --> 18:57.886
Oh, great.
Well, now it's just us.

18:57.970 --> 18:59.638
Yeah, thanks for ruining
the awesome captain-murder

18:59.721 --> 19:01.390
this was all building to.

19:01.473 --> 19:03.851
We were supposed to fight
on a rickety metal catwalk.

19:03.934 --> 19:05.519
Oh. Let me make it up to you.
Double punch!

19:05.602 --> 19:07.271
-(grunting)
-Double block.

19:07.354 --> 19:09.439
-Whoa. How did you...?
-I know all your moves

19:09.523 --> 19:11.358
-and everything about you.
-(both grunting)

19:11.441 --> 19:13.735
I know you dressed up
like Toby Targ every Halloween,

19:13.819 --> 19:17.906
even when you were too old.
(laughs)

19:17.990 --> 19:20.367
And I know
you actually love the warp core!

19:20.450 --> 19:22.160
Take that back.
The warp core's lame!

19:22.244 --> 19:24.913
(both grunting)

19:24.997 --> 19:26.582
You only break rules
because you know

19:26.665 --> 19:29.418
that's what everyone expects
you to do!

19:29.501 --> 19:30.794
If you really were a badass,

19:30.878 --> 19:32.588
you'd do the hard thing
and just be

19:32.671 --> 19:34.089
a good officer.

19:34.173 --> 19:37.092
(panting)

19:37.175 --> 19:39.887
They're not casting you
as the villain. You are!

19:39.970 --> 19:41.972
(grunts)

19:46.184 --> 19:48.979
Hey, I know you might be
a psychotic space raider

19:49.062 --> 19:50.939
whose boss
just destroyed my ship,

19:51.023 --> 19:53.901
but you...
are all right in my book.

19:53.984 --> 19:56.695
That's a book
I'd read cover to cover.

19:56.778 --> 19:59.781
Sir, you're the only person
who can see past my mask,

19:59.865 --> 20:01.783
and knows deep down,
I just want

20:01.867 --> 20:04.745
to replace a toranium ops module
with ionizing subcircuits.

20:04.828 --> 20:06.955
I know this is crazy, but do you
want to just-- I don't know--

20:07.039 --> 20:08.957
run away together,
and we could get our own ship,

20:09.041 --> 20:10.792
and we can buffer the phase coil
whenever we want

20:10.876 --> 20:13.170
or... or realign the matrix.

20:13.253 --> 20:16.506
We can fix the warp engines
on our time.

20:16.590 --> 20:18.342
It would be an honor, sir.

20:19.593 --> 20:23.305
Godspeed, you crazy (bleep).

20:23.388 --> 20:25.098
Ugh. Cap'n, I know
you've been through a lot today,

20:25.182 --> 20:26.975
but I made you a platter
of chocolate chip cookies,

20:27.059 --> 20:28.810
and I just want to know
what you think before I give it

20:28.894 --> 20:30.687
to the real you in real life,
so if you could... (whimpers)

20:30.771 --> 20:33.023
The captain's allergic
to chocolate. Assassin!

20:34.566 --> 20:36.026
-Great work, Jet!
-(whimpering)

20:36.109 --> 20:37.486
That's the kind
of assassin-tackling

20:37.569 --> 20:39.029
that'll land you a promotion.

20:39.112 --> 20:40.489
MAN:
Oh, hell yeah, Jet!

20:40.572 --> 20:42.157
Wait, wait. Cap'n, Cap'n,
where do you want me

20:42.240 --> 20:43.867
to see myself in five years?

20:43.951 --> 20:45.619
Don't answer that, Captain.
He's playing mind games!

20:45.702 --> 20:46.787
You're the man, Jet.

20:46.870 --> 20:48.455
-Get him out of here.
-Let's go.

20:48.538 --> 20:49.998
How can I be the man, Cap'n?

20:50.082 --> 20:51.500
I want to be the man!

20:51.583 --> 20:54.461
-(crackling)
-(gasps softly)

20:54.544 --> 20:56.505
(grunts)

20:56.588 --> 20:58.507
(both grunting)

20:58.590 --> 21:00.759
(grunts, laughs)

21:00.842 --> 21:02.552
-That's it. Keep up the act.
-(coughing)

21:02.636 --> 21:05.180
(laughing):
Oh, you know so much about me,

21:05.263 --> 21:07.849
but you missed one big thing.

21:07.933 --> 21:10.811
Oh, yeah, here we go-- time
for one of your snarky jokes.

21:10.894 --> 21:12.854
(coughs)
Yeah, I may hate protocol,

21:12.938 --> 21:15.065
but I don't hate this ship.
(coughs)

21:15.148 --> 21:16.692
I don't hate the crew.
I work with my best friends.

21:16.775 --> 21:19.861
The captain's my mom.
I would do anything for her.

21:19.945 --> 21:21.530
Oh, come on.
No, you hate the captain.

21:21.613 --> 21:23.031
You complain about her nonstop.

21:23.115 --> 21:24.491
It's like your whole thing!

21:24.574 --> 21:26.326
Yeah, I mean,
she's hard on me, right?

21:26.410 --> 21:28.161
She's the captain,
and I'm a pain in the ass.

21:28.245 --> 21:29.705
But if she kicked me off
the Cerritos,

21:29.788 --> 21:31.498
(coughs)
I would be done in Starfleet.

21:31.581 --> 21:33.834
She's watching out for me
the only way she knows how:

21:33.917 --> 21:36.044
in a (bleep) up,
overbearing, mom way.

21:36.128 --> 21:38.547
Oh, please. The only person
you care about is yourself.

21:38.630 --> 21:41.008
(cackles, whoops)

21:41.091 --> 21:42.884
Okay, well, then
why did I let you kick my ass

21:42.968 --> 21:44.553
to buy time for everyone
to get off the ship

21:44.636 --> 21:47.389
before the self-destruct
timer went off?

21:47.472 --> 21:49.766
-Wait. What?
-(laughs)

21:49.850 --> 21:51.935
♪ ♪

21:54.146 --> 21:57.065
No, no, no, no.
No, no, no! Aah!

21:57.149 --> 21:59.192
-No!
-(chime)

22:02.821 --> 22:05.574
Wow. I can't believe I just
got my ass kicked by myself

22:05.657 --> 22:07.242
and just... Wait.

22:07.325 --> 22:08.869
I guess I like working
on the ship and...

22:08.952 --> 22:12.122
Oh, my God. Therapy works.
Guys, therapy works!

22:15.459 --> 22:17.586
Honestly,
that was way more therapeutic

22:17.669 --> 22:19.254
than I thought it would be.
I worked through a lot.

22:19.337 --> 22:21.465
I feel great, too.
I just wish

22:21.548 --> 22:23.341
I could tell the real Billups
how I feel about him.

22:23.425 --> 22:24.968
Why don't you, man?
He's right there.

22:25.052 --> 22:27.137
Nah, I wouldn't want
to bother him. I mean,

22:27.220 --> 22:32.100
look at him.
Dude's a stone-cold badass.

22:32.184 --> 22:34.895
Hey, T.
I owe you an apology.

22:34.978 --> 22:36.980
The whole Orions-pirate thing.

22:37.064 --> 22:39.441
I-I feel really bad. I'm sorry
if I put you in a weird spot.

22:39.524 --> 22:41.943
Thanks. I appreciate it,
and the truth is,

22:42.027 --> 22:44.654
a lot of Orions are capitalist,
hyper-libertarian,

22:44.738 --> 22:46.948
gangster pirates,
just not this one.

22:47.032 --> 22:48.575
-That's why I'm here.
-Oh, well, thanks

22:48.658 --> 22:50.660
for having my back in there.
I owe you one.

22:50.744 --> 22:52.788
Um, so, do you want
to maybe go sit

22:52.871 --> 22:54.164
and look at the warp core
with me?

22:54.247 --> 22:56.249
Wow, so lame.
Yes. Let's do it.

22:56.333 --> 22:58.752
We talking warp core?
Ooh, baby, I'm in.

22:58.835 --> 23:02.631
(laughter)

23:02.714 --> 23:05.342
-Mariner.
-Hey, Cap.
Sorry about earlier today.

23:05.425 --> 23:07.636
I was way out of line.
Thanks for looking out.

23:08.678 --> 23:09.888
Later, skater.

23:11.723 --> 23:14.142
"Later skater"?
I know she's up to something!

23:14.226 --> 23:15.477
What did she tell you?

23:15.560 --> 23:17.104
Captain, you know I can't share

23:17.187 --> 23:18.480
what your crew tells me.

23:18.563 --> 23:20.482
That'd be a real ethical pickle.

23:20.565 --> 23:21.858
What?!
If she's planning something,

23:21.942 --> 23:23.860
-I have a right to know.
-Carol,

23:23.944 --> 23:25.487
you're being a pineapple
right now.

23:25.570 --> 23:28.323
Ugh! Stop referencing foods!

23:30.283 --> 23:31.827
Okay. No more distractions.
I just need to know

23:31.910 --> 23:33.286
what to wear to the interview.
(clears throat)

23:33.370 --> 23:34.663
-Computer, continue program.
-(chime)

23:34.746 --> 23:36.373
Hey, Cap'n,
do you like turtlenecks

23:36.456 --> 23:38.667
-or just standard uniform?
-Against insurmountable odds.

23:38.750 --> 23:40.418
Oh, sorry. You got something
going on here. I'll wait.

23:40.502 --> 23:43.171
As captain, it was an honor
serving beside her.

23:43.255 --> 23:46.675
As a mother, it was a privilege
to call Mariner my daughter.

23:46.758 --> 23:48.802
-Wait. What?
-That's right.

23:48.885 --> 23:50.554
Mariner was my daughter
the whole time.

23:50.637 --> 23:52.681
It's a secret
we didn't want anyone to know.

23:52.764 --> 23:54.349
-Uh, uh... (whimpers)
-And if someone had ever

23:54.432 --> 23:55.642
found out she was my baby girl,

23:55.725 --> 23:57.936
I don't know
what I would have done.

23:58.019 --> 23:59.813
Probably
kicked them off the ship,

23:59.896 --> 24:01.690
maybe even court-martialed them
right out of Starfleet.

24:01.773 --> 24:03.191
(laughing):
I was being crazy.

24:03.275 --> 24:04.693
-(whimpers)
-Thank goodness

24:04.776 --> 24:07.028
-nobody ever found out.
-Computer, end program!

24:07.112 --> 24:09.656
-(chime)
-(panting)

24:09.739 --> 24:11.700
Ooh! (shrieks)

24:11.783 --> 24:13.368
Hey, nerd, we're going
to go stare at the warp core.

24:13.451 --> 24:15.370
You want to...?
Whoa. You okay?

24:15.453 --> 24:17.873
-(high-pitched): Yeah.
-All right, whatevs. Hey.

24:17.956 --> 24:19.875
Good luck with the interview.
You're gonna do great.

24:19.958 --> 24:22.836
(whimpers)

24:22.919 --> 24:24.254
-(whimpering)
-So, you're interested

24:24.337 --> 24:26.006
in the advanced
diplomacy workshop.

24:26.089 --> 24:28.717
Where do you see yourself
negotiating peace in five years?

24:28.800 --> 24:30.719
I... uh...

24:30.802 --> 24:33.680
Just take a breath and say the
first thing that comes to mind.

24:33.763 --> 24:35.390
-Mariner. (groans)
-Mariner what?!

24:35.473 --> 24:38.393
-Uh... is hot?
-Excuse me?!

24:38.476 --> 24:41.563
Uh, I don't know! She's not hot!
She's nasty! (whimpers)

24:41.646 --> 24:43.231
(yells, cries)

24:43.315 --> 24:45.275
(door whooshes open, shut)

24:45.358 --> 24:49.779
Ensign Boimler didn't bother to
prepare for interview. Terrible.

25:02.167 --> 25:04.544
Revenge!

25:04.628 --> 25:06.421
-(grunts)
-Not-a today.

25:06.504 --> 25:09.716
Not-a on-a da Vinci's watch.
