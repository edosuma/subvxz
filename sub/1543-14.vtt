WEBVTT

00:03.737 --> 00:04.841
What's your sin?

00:06.707 --> 00:08.914
I was a horrible mother.

00:09.076 --> 00:11.682
You are shamelessly sucking up
so that I'll free you...

00:11.845 --> 00:14.758
...so you can run amok
and gum up my operation once again.

00:14.915 --> 00:17.225
Who is there left for you to trust?

00:18.552 --> 00:20.225
You and I are very much alike.

00:20.387 --> 00:21.923
Except I didn't kill my brother.

00:22.089 --> 00:24.899
The mark can be transferred
to someone who's worthy.

00:25.058 --> 00:27.664
But when I call you, use the blade on me.

00:27.828 --> 00:31.901
Don'! you think if Cain knew how
to remove the mark, he'd have done it?

00:32.064 --> 00:34.602
- I'm done trying to find a cure.
- Cass is so close.

00:34.768 --> 00:38.341
Maybe Cass is onto something with Cain,
but the answer is not out there.

00:38.505 --> 00:39.575
It's with me.

00:39.740 --> 00:42.778
So I'm gonna fight it
till I can't fight it anymore.

01:02.296 --> 01:03.400
Lights out in five.

01:04.730 --> 01:07.143
Hey, any mail?

01:07.935 --> 01:11.405
Oh, the usual.
Postcards from anti-penalty folk.

01:12.139 --> 01:14.244
Proposals from your lady admirers.

01:14.641 --> 01:16.484
You said you were done with those.

01:19.112 --> 01:21.422
Hey, how's your wife, by the way?

01:21.582 --> 01:23.493
Amanda.

01:24.551 --> 01:25.996
That's her name, isn't it?

01:30.958 --> 01:33.404
You know, I killed an Amanda once.

01:35.329 --> 01:37.002
My fourth.

01:42.002 --> 01:44.778
I'd do your wife the same, buddy.

01:45.439 --> 01:47.976
Only slower.

01:48.141 --> 01:50.417
Two weeks from Tuesday, Tommy.

01:53.513 --> 01:55.186
Let's do it.

01:55.349 --> 01:58.023
Let's do it now! Hey!

02:30.017 --> 02:32.691
Tolliver giving you the usual grief? Heh.

02:32.853 --> 02:34.230
Nothing new.

02:50.737 --> 02:52.580
I can't wait till he's gone.

03:15.762 --> 03:17.105
Who the hell are you?

03:17.698 --> 03:21.373
- How'd you get in here?
- I've gone by many names in this life.

03:22.035 --> 03:24.037
The Father of Murder's one of them.

03:27.874 --> 03:32.289
And by the state's count,
you've taken six lives yourself, Tommy.

03:33.380 --> 03:37.055
Although by my count, it's nine.

03:37.751 --> 03:39.788
Oh, come on.

03:39.953 --> 03:43.628
You aren't one of those
"it wasn't me" -type fellas, are you?

03:44.791 --> 03:47.533
Because I know you're a killer...

03:47.694 --> 03:49.469
...just like me.

03:51.298 --> 03:54.472
Yeah, I did it.

03:55.068 --> 03:57.912
Honesty. That's good.

04:00.140 --> 04:01.983
That's the spirit.

04:08.548 --> 04:11.893
Now, I bet you're wondering
what I'm doing here.

04:12.052 --> 04:15.158
Did I come to punish you or save you?

04:15.989 --> 04:17.468
Well...

04:18.825 --> 04:20.964
...the truth is, Tommy...

04:22.062 --> 04:23.666
...I'm here to do both.

04:42.015 --> 04:44.359
- The Zodiac.
- Seven victims.

04:44.518 --> 04:46.862
- Dahmer.
- Seventeen.

04:47.020 --> 04:49.694
That's some freaky stuff, man.
It's a whole new side of you.

04:49.856 --> 04:51.858
It's called true crime, Dean. It's a hobby.

04:52.025 --> 04:55.472
No, bass-fishing, needlepoint,
that's a hobby, okay?

04:55.629 --> 04:57.666
Collecting serial-killer stats, that's...

04:57.831 --> 05:00.107
- That is an illness.
- Heh.

05:00.267 --> 05:02.645
- Got your badge?
- Yeah.

05:08.942 --> 05:10.944
State the nature of your visit.

05:11.111 --> 05:15.651
From the office of the Inspector General.
Got an appointment with the warden.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.659
Thank you. Parking is to the left.

05:17.818 --> 05:20.128
Look for visitor parking only.

05:21.221 --> 05:25.192
All right, so, what are the stats
on this, uh, vanishing act here?

05:25.358 --> 05:28.805
Tommy Tolliver was convicted
of six murders back in '09.

05:28.962 --> 05:31.067
But those are just the ones that stuck.

05:31.231 --> 05:34.804
According to the news, he escaped
from a locked cell on death row.

05:34.968 --> 05:37.915
This inexplicable Houdini-esque escape.

05:39.005 --> 05:41.986
What do we think? It's some sort
of a mass-murdering magician?

05:42.142 --> 05:46.420
A teleporting demon, or a who-knows-what
that can walk through superman walls.

05:47.414 --> 05:50.588
- Could be in our wheelhouse.
- Pfft. Yeah, your wheelhouse.

05:50.750 --> 05:52.388
A hobby.

05:58.892 --> 06:00.530
Warden Skeefe?

06:00.927 --> 06:03.601
Uh, Inspectors Moore and Ranaldo.
We spoke on the phone.

06:03.763 --> 06:06.744
Yeah. Welcome to death row.

06:06.900 --> 06:08.004
Have a look.

06:09.436 --> 06:13.509
But good luck finding anything
out of TDCJ compliance.

06:19.079 --> 06:21.389
So why don't you tell me what happened?

06:22.082 --> 06:25.461
The night Tolliver disappeared,
our little ship was run as tight as ever.

06:25.619 --> 06:27.428
And I got documentation to prove it.

06:27.587 --> 06:29.589
You stand by what the press is saying?

06:29.756 --> 06:32.737
Locked cell, no security breach,
no guard misconduct?

06:32.893 --> 06:34.463
Which press?

06:34.628 --> 06:38.132
Mainstream media's calling for my head,
said I was grossly incompetent.

06:38.298 --> 06:41.074
- But the tabloids, they're saying...
- They say it's magic. Heh.

06:41.234 --> 06:44.647
That Tommy pulled off
some dark miracle to escape.

06:46.139 --> 06:49.382
- You saying you believe that?
- There was some kind of magician...

06:49.542 --> 06:52.079
...on the block last night,
but it wasn't Tommy.

06:55.282 --> 06:57.728
That's right before Tolliver vanished.

07:00.987 --> 07:04.491
- A brownout?
- That was my thought, but then...

07:08.662 --> 07:10.300
- Is that one of the guards?
- Nope.

07:11.464 --> 07:15.776
But I don't know who he is, how he got in,
or how he and Tolliver got out.

07:15.936 --> 07:17.438
Can you zoom in on that?

07:17.604 --> 07:20.744
Can and have. Too dark
to make out much of anything.

07:20.907 --> 07:22.511
Do it.

07:25.011 --> 07:26.251
Freeze it.

07:27.847 --> 07:29.349
Blow it up.

07:45.865 --> 07:47.970
Gonna answer that?

07:48.134 --> 07:49.670
Not at this moment.

07:51.204 --> 07:54.378
You're wasting your time.

07:54.541 --> 07:56.817
I told you, I don't know where he is.

07:58.211 --> 08:00.384
Me and Cain ain't friends.

08:00.547 --> 08:03.892
He kills demons.
Low-level guys like me keep our distance.

08:05.552 --> 08:07.691
You sure about that?

08:08.388 --> 08:10.664
All right, all right.

08:16.162 --> 08:21.168
He's been seen the past few months
making passes through Bogsmarsh...

08:21.534 --> 08:23.514
...one county over.

08:24.404 --> 08:26.577
No one knows why, what for.

08:26.740 --> 08:29.550
Like I said, we keep our distance.

08:33.480 --> 08:35.015
And that's all you know?

08:36.349 --> 08:37.760
Yes.

08:38.385 --> 08:40.365
Yes, I swear.

08:46.092 --> 08:47.571
Okay.

08:54.834 --> 08:58.748
Eighty-six last quarter,
but I only got credit for 48.

08:58.905 --> 09:03.115
And I was working with Alban
on nearly all of those soul jobs.

09:03.610 --> 09:07.922
If you don't arrive at a point within
the next 10 seconds, so help me I'll...

09:08.081 --> 09:12.689
As a crossroads demon, I have received less
credit than I am due for soul collections...

09:14.454 --> 09:15.899
...my King-

09:20.126 --> 09:22.299
So you're looking for a promotion?

09:22.462 --> 09:24.567
No, I'm just asking...

09:26.766 --> 09:30.873
I'm merely suggesting that I get credit
for the work that I did beside Alban.

09:31.404 --> 09:33.406
Equal credit for equal work.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.985
- Fine, you can have your credit.
- Thank you.

09:36.142 --> 09:38.554
The nerve of the wee man. Ugh.

09:40.480 --> 09:45.623
Mother, you have an opinion
you'd like to share with the room?

09:46.453 --> 09:48.660
Oh, no. Private thought.

09:48.822 --> 09:52.793
Nothing to do with you
or the affairs of the court.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.637
It's just not what I would do.

09:58.798 --> 10:00.334
Oh, enlighten us all.

10:00.500 --> 10:03.606
What would you do?

10:05.305 --> 10:09.776
This demon asks you to equalize credit
for his and another's work.

10:10.477 --> 10:12.684
Split the baby, if you will.

10:12.846 --> 10:15.190
Well, heh...

10:15.348 --> 10:19.490
...then I would well and
truly split the baby.

10:22.322 --> 10:28.830
I'd cut this pulling, pathetic,
grade-grubbing git in two...

10:28.995 --> 10:30.201
...literally.

10:30.363 --> 10:33.105
Then I'd nail his bloody halves
to the doors of the court...

10:33.266 --> 10:37.715
...a reminder to all
not to waste the king's time.

10:39.005 --> 10:42.885
Whiners beget whiners.
You can't reward behavior like that.

10:43.042 --> 10:46.216
Why I never gave in
when you asked for sweeties as a child...

10:46.379 --> 10:49.053
...no matter how much you cried.

10:50.316 --> 10:53.354
Well, you were a very...

10:54.687 --> 10:58.362
...chunky child, darling. Bit of a bloater.

10:58.525 --> 10:59.868
That's enough.

11:08.334 --> 11:10.336
What'll it be, sir?

11:17.977 --> 11:20.014
Let's do...

11:21.080 --> 11:22.218
...what she said.

11:23.516 --> 11:26.986
Wha...? No, no, no. No, no!

11:27.153 --> 11:29.360
No, no, come on!

11:30.256 --> 11:32.258
That's my boy.

11:38.264 --> 11:41.040
- So?
- Cass is still not answering.

11:41.201 --> 11:43.613
Great. Well, I have been looking
into Tommy Tolliver...

11:43.770 --> 11:47.377
...seeing if I can figure out why Cain went
to the trouble of springing him.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.383
- And?
- Still pretty unclear.

11:49.542 --> 11:53.456
I did find this blotter out of Orlando
about his dad, Leon Tolliver.

11:53.613 --> 11:54.921
Uh, like father, like son.

11:55.381 --> 11:57.952
Convicted felon, fresh warrant
for an assault charge.

11:58.117 --> 12:01.189
But he's gone missing.
Hasn't been seen in a week.

12:01.354 --> 12:02.958
You think the two are connected?

12:03.122 --> 12:06.069
I mean, police just assumed
he'd fled the warrant...

12:06.226 --> 12:09.799
...but if Cain took Tommy,
it might not be a coincidence.

12:10.430 --> 12:13.138
So, what, Cain's got a vendetta
against the entire family?

12:14.033 --> 12:15.034
Maybe.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.642
It's Cass.

12:21.941 --> 12:23.943
- Hey, where you at?
- Illinois.

12:24.110 --> 12:25.714
Hey, Cass, we got a lead.

12:25.878 --> 12:29.792
Cain abducted a Texas death-row inmate
named Tommy Tolliver.

12:32.118 --> 12:33.825
- He's dead.
- What?

12:33.987 --> 12:36.968
- How do you know?
- Call it an educated guess.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.930
Cain has been very busy.

12:43.630 --> 12:46.110
Okay, where are you? We'll come to you.

12:49.068 --> 12:51.309
I'll call you back.

13:02.849 --> 13:05.125
Hello, Castiel.

13:10.823 --> 13:12.530
What have you done?

13:12.692 --> 13:14.433
These bodies?

13:15.295 --> 13:18.708
Just cleaning up a mess
I made a long time ago.

13:18.865 --> 13:21.869
Cain, I know what you were.

13:22.635 --> 13:25.946
- But you'd resisted for so long.
- What can I say?

13:26.105 --> 13:27.812
I got the taste back.

13:29.309 --> 13:33.519
With Abaddon's army gunning for me,
I had to take up arms again.

13:34.380 --> 13:35.882
I liked how it felt.

13:36.883 --> 13:39.557
Those were demons. These...

13:40.953 --> 13:42.660
Humans.

13:42.822 --> 13:46.235
Well, the mark thirsts for all kinds.

13:46.726 --> 13:48.171
This is a massacre.

13:50.229 --> 13:51.640
Yes.

13:52.732 --> 13:54.575
And soon it'll be a genocide.

13:57.570 --> 14:02.246
My children, my whole poisoned issue.

14:03.843 --> 14:05.413
A lot of them out there right now.

14:06.079 --> 14:09.151
Killers, fighters, thieves.

14:09.749 --> 14:11.524
Some more peaceful than others.

14:11.918 --> 14:14.091
But they still carry it...

14:14.520 --> 14:16.431
...the disease.

14:16.589 --> 14:18.694
If the mark wants blood, I'll give it mine.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.496
You'll kill them all?

14:20.660 --> 14:24.198
You are Adam and Eve's firstborn.

14:24.731 --> 14:26.677
Your descendants are legion.

14:27.066 --> 14:28.909
Most I'm culling...

14:29.435 --> 14:30.709
...one in 10.

14:31.204 --> 14:33.275
- Of everyone?
- I've got time.

14:35.274 --> 14:37.117
How's Dean, by the way?

14:37.276 --> 14:40.689
I hear he did good. He took Abaddon down.

14:43.783 --> 14:45.387
He's not well?

14:48.187 --> 14:50.463
Even with the first blade hidden...

14:50.790 --> 14:54.397
...Dean is losing his
fight against the mark.

14:54.560 --> 14:57.302
- If we don't find a cure...
- There is no cure.

14:57.463 --> 14:59.204
I'm living proof of that.

15:00.266 --> 15:01.802
But don't worry about Dean.

15:01.968 --> 15:04.972
I'll get to him in due time.

15:09.742 --> 15:11.619
Sorry, Castiel.

15:12.111 --> 15:13.988
You're not on my list.

15:21.621 --> 15:23.498
Crowley.

15:23.823 --> 15:26.497
Long day. I'm sure you must be tired.

15:26.659 --> 15:29.435
- But I've had a wee idea.
- Yes?

15:29.595 --> 15:34.510
The name Olivette means little to you.
High-ranking member of the Grand Coven.

15:34.667 --> 15:36.510
The one who led the charge against me.

15:37.270 --> 15:40.342
Really, it's a grudge, I
won't even deny it...

15:40.506 --> 15:44.818
...but she's just come back to the States,
and I thought...

15:44.977 --> 15:50.950
...if you in your kingly beneficence
would be so kind as to assist me...

15:51.684 --> 15:54.790
...now would be an
excellent time to strike.

15:58.324 --> 16:00.031
Well done, Mother.

16:00.860 --> 16:03.204
Next time you run a long con...

16:03.362 --> 16:09.711
...let more than a few hours of suspicious,
entirely uncharacteristic usefulness pass...

16:09.869 --> 16:11.871
...before making your ask.

16:12.038 --> 16:14.712
You think I had an ulterior motive?

16:14.874 --> 16:17.047
That I've been manipulating you?

16:17.210 --> 16:19.622
You couldn't be more transparent.

16:19.779 --> 16:22.851
Heh. Well, duh.

16:23.015 --> 16:25.621
Of course I was manipulating you.

16:25.785 --> 16:27.890
I am your mother, after all.

16:28.788 --> 16:31.735
Manipulation's who we are.

16:32.191 --> 16:33.670
Oh.

16:33.826 --> 16:35.999
My wee sausage.

16:36.996 --> 16:39.203
What matter is it that I had a motive?

16:39.365 --> 16:41.572
We had fun today, didn't we?

16:42.502 --> 16:43.742
It was fine.

16:43.903 --> 16:45.974
We could have more.

16:46.138 --> 16:51.087
Get out of this dump,
a break from these foul-smelling suck-ups.

16:51.244 --> 16:54.088
Flex our muscles in the real world.

16:54.247 --> 16:57.228
And in the process
take out a miserable old witch...

16:57.383 --> 17:00.887
...who's been standing in my way
for centuries.

17:02.321 --> 17:03.891
What do you say?

17:14.599 --> 17:16.910
I'm sorry I couldn't
bring better news, Dean.

17:17.069 --> 17:19.242
- It's not your fault, Cass.
- Thank you.

17:19.405 --> 17:22.784
Sheriff gave me a few more names,
some preliminary IDs on the bodies.

17:22.942 --> 17:25.444
- And?
- And it seems to fit Case's story.

17:25.611 --> 17:28.683
I mean, there's no way
to tell the relation to Cain, obviously...

17:28.848 --> 17:31.624
...but he's wiping out entire families,
one after another.

17:31.784 --> 17:34.560
So who's next?
Is he done with the Tollivers?

17:34.720 --> 17:38.099
I think so. Leon didn't have
any siblings or any other children...

17:38.257 --> 17:40.635
...and Tommy was never married, so...

17:41.093 --> 17:43.130
Oh, come on. Damn it.

17:44.263 --> 17:47.767
- What?
- Tommy did have a son. Estranged.

17:47.934 --> 17:50.312
Lives with his mother in Ohio.

17:50.469 --> 17:53.814
- Uh, Austin Reynolds, 12 years old.
- Ls the kid still alive?

17:57.944 --> 18:00.754
As of an hour ago,
yeah, he updated his status.

18:03.950 --> 18:06.328
But it's a kid.
You don't really think Cain would...?

18:06.485 --> 18:08.260
Yes, he would.

18:08.421 --> 18:11.095
There were old men
in those graves, Sam, women.

18:11.257 --> 18:15.000
I mean, you heard Cass.
It's a fire sale. Everyone must go.

18:16.495 --> 18:17.997
Where you going?

18:19.498 --> 18:21.000
We know where Cain's gonna be.

18:23.469 --> 18:25.449
The kid's in danger.

18:26.505 --> 18:30.783
Okay, so, what, we track him down to Ohio,
and then what?

18:33.980 --> 18:36.153
Then I'll do what I have to do.

18:39.819 --> 18:41.492
I'll kill Cain.

18:55.334 --> 18:59.441
When he gave me the mark,
Cain said that this day would come.

19:00.039 --> 19:03.885
That after I killed Abaddon,
I would have to come and put him down.

19:04.510 --> 19:07.889
- Great, you're taking orders from a madman?
- No, he wasn't mad then.

19:09.048 --> 19:11.551
Cain resisted the mark for a long time.

19:12.151 --> 19:14.392
Then I came kicking up trouble
about the blade.

19:14.553 --> 19:16.999
I sent him down this path. This is on me.

19:17.156 --> 19:19.534
- Doesn't mean you have to go after him.
- It does.

19:20.059 --> 19:22.562
There's only one thing that can kill him.

19:23.729 --> 19:24.833
The blade.

19:25.898 --> 19:27.571
Dean's right.

19:30.736 --> 19:35.481
Dean, wielding the blade
against Cain himself...

19:37.476 --> 19:39.251
...win or lose...

19:39.412 --> 19:42.052
...you may never come back from that fight.

19:48.721 --> 19:50.200
I know.

19:51.590 --> 19:54.434
I'll need a demon force
to get us past her security.

19:54.593 --> 19:56.664
Two units of 10 should suffice.

19:56.829 --> 20:00.242
Once we're inside,
we'll want to throw her off guard...

20:00.399 --> 20:03.539
...mess with her head a little bit,
so I thought...

20:04.770 --> 20:06.249
...Rune of Amaranth.

20:06.772 --> 20:09.446
Illusion work. Smart.

20:10.943 --> 20:13.287
Excuse me. I'll be right back.

20:14.380 --> 20:16.087
Well, well, well, if it isn't...

20:16.248 --> 20:17.750
Cain's back.

20:17.917 --> 20:19.760
He's gone dark, and I need the blade.

20:19.919 --> 20:21.921
Why would I do that for you?

20:22.088 --> 20:25.399
Because you have as much reason
to want Cain off the board as anyone.

20:25.791 --> 20:29.034
Cain has a kill list, and you're on it.

20:37.136 --> 20:38.945
What do you say, Crowley, you in?

20:40.639 --> 20:43.483
- Yes.
- Good, I'll text you the location.

20:45.611 --> 20:50.651
Once she's well-flustered, I've got an
especially nasty spell to finish her off with.

20:50.816 --> 20:52.386
Mother, it's not happening.

20:52.551 --> 20:53.962
- What?
- Not today.

20:54.120 --> 20:56.100
- Where are you going?
- Something's come up.

20:56.255 --> 20:59.168
Olivette can wait. This can't.

21:00.826 --> 21:02.635
Is that what I think it is?

21:02.795 --> 21:05.969
- Not that it's any of your business.
- Let me guess.

21:06.132 --> 21:09.238
Bringing it to your wee pal,
the Winchester boy.

21:09.401 --> 21:12.905
You'd give that to the one person
who can harness its power against you.

21:13.072 --> 21:16.918
- He's a threat to you.
- We've a common enemy, a bigger threat.

21:17.076 --> 21:21.024
Well, if he's not a threat to your life,
he's certainly a threat to your credibility.

21:21.180 --> 21:23.683
We've talked about what this does
to your reputation.

21:23.849 --> 21:25.954
We're not having this conversation.

21:26.118 --> 21:28.621
Consorting with hunters.

21:28.788 --> 21:30.358
Oh, me, oh, my.

21:30.523 --> 21:35.029
You honestly believe that they're your
friends, that they care about you?

21:39.598 --> 21:42.374
- The kid here?
- He's nearby.

21:42.802 --> 21:46.545
Upstairs in the barn.
He's playing with a basketball.

21:47.873 --> 21:51.719
Cain will strike soon.
Maybe tonight, maybe tomorrow, but soon.

21:51.877 --> 21:53.220
- And when he does...
- I got it.

21:53.379 --> 21:56.019
You charge in with the blade, solo.

21:57.049 --> 22:00.189
And the kid? What, we just watch and wait
until Cain attacks?

22:00.352 --> 22:04.061
- I thought this was a rescue mission.
- We save the kid after Cain shows.

22:04.223 --> 22:07.067
We know what Cain's after.
That's our only advantage.

22:07.226 --> 22:09.399
We wanna trap Cain, we use it.

22:09.562 --> 22:12.406
Twelve-year-old as bait.
I can't believe what I'm hearing.

22:12.565 --> 22:13.908
Neither can I.

22:17.203 --> 22:19.911
What's the matter, Crowley,
you suddenly grow a conscience?

22:20.072 --> 22:23.679
- Too good to put a minor in danger?
- Don't give a damn about the kid.

22:23.843 --> 22:26.050
I'm talking about the risk to us.

22:26.212 --> 22:27.247
There is no us.

22:28.547 --> 22:31.255
You're here for one reason,
that's to hand me the blade.

22:31.417 --> 22:33.260
Yeah, about that.

22:33.419 --> 22:36.195
Seeing as this is shaping up to be one...

22:36.355 --> 22:40.235
...of those two-step,
capture-then-kill kind of deals...

22:40.392 --> 22:44.397
...I think your buddies would agree it's
better to keep the blade out of your hands...

22:44.563 --> 22:47.669
...until we've got Cain sewn up,
just to be safe.

22:53.439 --> 22:56.113
Now, back to this plan of yours.

23:13.626 --> 23:15.128
So...

23:16.095 --> 23:20.202
...if this works and we capture Cain...

23:21.567 --> 23:23.046
...then what?

23:23.636 --> 23:27.209
We'll cross that bridge when we...
If we come to it.

23:31.543 --> 23:35.252
You know last week when I said that I would
go down swinging when the time came?

23:36.916 --> 23:39.624
I meant that I was at peace with that.

23:41.253 --> 23:44.097
I just didn't realize
the time would come so soon.

23:44.790 --> 23:46.633
Like right now.

23:56.835 --> 23:59.008
I'm scared, Sam.

24:16.655 --> 24:18.293
Someone there?

24:25.464 --> 24:26.966
Hello, Austin.

24:27.866 --> 24:29.641
What are you doing here?

24:30.803 --> 24:32.805
I'm here to kill you.

24:33.672 --> 24:35.310
No, you won't.

24:35.474 --> 24:37.044
Run.

24:39.211 --> 24:40.815
You can't stop me.

25:22.187 --> 25:24.724
Don't. Please, don't.

25:34.333 --> 25:38.839
- Illusion spell.
- Oh, yeah, real Austin is long gone.

25:40.672 --> 25:42.618
Eighteenth-century magic.

25:42.775 --> 25:46.382
If I had to hazard a guess,
Rune of Amaranth.

25:46.545 --> 25:50.049
Good eye. Something I picked up
from my mother.

25:52.951 --> 25:55.522
Well, I know you fear me.

25:56.221 --> 25:58.030
So I can only assume...

26:01.593 --> 26:03.800
Ah. Clever.

26:05.597 --> 26:07.201
Won't hold me for long, you know.

26:08.200 --> 26:09.975
Won't need to.

26:23.816 --> 26:26.296
Cass. Hey.

26:26.452 --> 26:27.590
- You okay?
- Fine.

26:29.121 --> 26:30.600
It worked?

26:31.123 --> 26:32.295
Yeah.

26:33.759 --> 26:35.932
- My turn.
- Dean, look, we wanna help.

26:36.095 --> 26:37.301
No.

26:37.463 --> 26:39.500
No, with you in the ring...

26:39.665 --> 26:41.110
...you'd just be a liability.

26:41.266 --> 26:44.440
- Dean... - I'd be worried about
what he could do to you.

26:45.104 --> 26:46.674
Or what I could.

26:49.508 --> 26:53.820
Plus I need you three out here
to take out whatever comes out of there.

26:55.848 --> 26:58.658
And I'm serious.
I mean, whatever comes out.

27:01.587 --> 27:02.691
Happilly.

27:15.701 --> 27:19.774
What guarantee do I have
that you'll give it back when you're done'?

27:20.839 --> 27:24.446
I survive and I come out of there
and I don't give it back...

27:25.043 --> 27:27.683
...you'll all have a much bigger problem
on your hands.

27:39.224 --> 27:40.703
Dean?

27:47.866 --> 27:49.174
I'm good.

28:35.614 --> 28:37.389
Hello, Dean.

28:41.920 --> 28:44.059
At a loss for words, my son'?

28:44.590 --> 28:46.592
Allow me.

28:47.626 --> 28:51.972
This is the part where you tell me
it's not too late...

28:52.130 --> 28:53.973
...that I can lay down arms.

28:55.434 --> 28:57.607
Abandon my mission.

28:57.769 --> 28:59.646
We don't have to fight.

29:01.406 --> 29:03.647
I'll spare us the formalities.

29:05.277 --> 29:07.416
You're past talking down.

29:08.113 --> 29:09.456
Cain, you're fully mental.

29:09.615 --> 29:11.959
Oh, I prefer to think I've
finally gotten clear.

29:12.618 --> 29:16.156
When I made my bargain with Lucifer,
killed Abel...

29:17.089 --> 29:19.831
...I released a stain upon the earth.

29:20.826 --> 29:24.899
A stain deeper and far more lasting
than mere precedence.

29:26.064 --> 29:28.305
Your bloodline is tainted.

29:28.467 --> 29:31.175
- So you say.
- So I know.

29:33.005 --> 29:36.612
Not all killers are my descendants
and not all my descendants are killers...

29:36.775 --> 29:37.810
...but enough are.

29:38.277 --> 29:41.986
Enough for me to know that extinguishing
them is the least I owe this world.

29:42.848 --> 29:44.691
Can you honestly tell me...

29:44.850 --> 29:49.094
“that humanity's not better off
with fewer Tommys and fewer Leons?

29:49.855 --> 29:51.198
Fewer yous?

29:54.192 --> 29:55.330
And what about the kid?

29:56.595 --> 29:58.700
He could go either way.

29:58.864 --> 30:00.434
I prefer to be thorough.

30:03.201 --> 30:04.703
How's it feel, Dean...

30:05.837 --> 30:07.874
...holding the blade again?

30:12.044 --> 30:14.650
It feels like a means to an end.

30:29.561 --> 30:31.370
Then do it.

31:34.393 --> 31:38.307
That seems a bit weaker than I would expect
from you with the blade.

31:40.465 --> 31:42.069
I think you can do better.

31:46.271 --> 31:48.251
- Unless...
- Ungh!

31:53.545 --> 31:54.922
...you're holding back.

31:58.650 --> 32:02.757
What is it, Dean? Do you think if you
hold back just enough, you won't succumb?

32:02.921 --> 32:06.391
That you'll leave this fight
the same as you entered?

32:07.893 --> 32:10.339
Look to my example, boy!

32:10.495 --> 32:13.499
There is no resisting
the mark or the blade.

32:13.665 --> 32:16.305
There is only remission and relapse!

32:26.011 --> 32:28.252
You told me...

32:28.413 --> 32:30.484
...that this day would come.

32:32.451 --> 32:34.954
You told me that I would have to kill you.

32:35.587 --> 32:37.464
Is that so?

32:44.029 --> 32:46.771
I'm afraid you've misunderstood
my intentions here, Dean.

32:48.366 --> 32:52.781
When your pet angel found my burial site,
I thought about ending him...

32:52.938 --> 32:55.350
...and swatting him like a fly.

32:56.441 --> 32:58.148
But then I thought about you.

32:58.310 --> 33:02.781
Your biggest weakness,
the thing I noticed the moment I met you...

33:02.948 --> 33:04.393
...your courage...

33:04.549 --> 33:06.893
...your reckless bravado.

33:07.853 --> 33:11.665
I let him go knowing
that he would report back to you...

33:11.823 --> 33:15.737
...knowing you would bring into battle
the one thing that can kill me.

33:16.628 --> 33:19.507
The one thing I truly want.

33:32.410 --> 33:35.516
Oh, it's been too long.

33:37.048 --> 33:39.153
That old feeling.

33:39.317 --> 33:42.230
Makes me wonder how
I ever had the strength to resist.

33:45.690 --> 33:48.864
This may be hard to believe
in light of what I'm about to do to you...

33:49.027 --> 33:50.904
...but I care about you, Dean.

33:51.062 --> 33:52.097
I truly do.

33:52.597 --> 33:55.441
But I know I'm doing you a favor.

33:55.600 --> 33:57.079
I'm saving you.

33:58.336 --> 33:59.940
Saving me from what?

34:00.605 --> 34:01.845
From your fate.

34:04.543 --> 34:06.216
Has it never occurred to you?

34:06.778 --> 34:10.418
Have you never mused upon the fact
that you're living my life in reverse?

34:11.283 --> 34:13.889
My story began when I killed my brother...

34:14.052 --> 34:16.931
...and that's where your story
inevitably will end.

34:17.956 --> 34:19.958
No, never.

34:20.625 --> 34:23.469
- Ungh!
- It's called the Mark of Cain for a reason.

34:24.563 --> 34:28.636
First, first you'd kill Crowley. There'd be
some strange mixed feelings on that one...

34:28.800 --> 34:32.407
...but you'd have your reason.
You'd get it done, no remorse.

34:32.571 --> 34:36.542
And then you'd kill the angel, Castiel.
Now, that one...

34:36.708 --> 34:40.485
...that, I suspect,
would hurt something awful.

34:40.645 --> 34:44.320
And then, then would come the murder
you'd never survive.

34:45.150 --> 34:49.826
The one that would finally turn you
into as much of a savage as it did me.

34:49.987 --> 34:52.092
- No.
- Your brother, Sam.

34:52.724 --> 34:57.969
The only thing standing between you
and that destiny is this blade.

34:59.931 --> 35:02.138
You're welcome, my son.

35:24.990 --> 35:26.833
What's the matter?

35:33.264 --> 35:35.972
Tell me I don't have to do this.

35:38.503 --> 35:40.107
Tell me that you'll stop.

35:42.540 --> 35:44.281
Tell me that you can stop.

35:46.211 --> 35:48.384
I will never stop.

36:54.612 --> 36:55.955
Dean.

36:57.849 --> 36:59.192
Dean.

37:00.118 --> 37:01.620
The blade.

37:30.482 --> 37:32.223
You lied to me.

37:34.586 --> 37:36.156
It's not the first time today.

37:39.324 --> 37:40.496
Cain's list?

37:42.093 --> 37:43.470
You weren't on it.

37:51.136 --> 37:53.173
Hey, hey, hey.

37:54.239 --> 37:55.741
You did it.

37:58.176 --> 38:00.019
Dean, you did it.

38:24.702 --> 38:25.840
Fergus...

38:26.004 --> 38:29.542
I don't wanna hear it, the I-told-you-so's.

38:29.707 --> 38:30.708
Not now.

38:35.180 --> 38:36.716
What are you doing?

38:37.215 --> 38:40.059
What's it look like? I'm leaving.

38:40.218 --> 38:43.062
Another petty manipulation.

38:45.056 --> 38:47.900
- No.
- Then what, Mother?

38:48.059 --> 38:49.902
What do you want from me?

38:52.063 --> 38:57.570
You can't understand
my disappointment or my pride.

38:58.703 --> 39:03.584
You don't know this, but after I left you,
after I was forced to leave you...

39:04.242 --> 39:07.587
...I heard of your death,
your mortal death.

39:07.912 --> 39:09.914
I thought you were gone to me forever.

39:11.049 --> 39:14.223
Then, hundreds of years later...

39:14.385 --> 39:16.865
...and thousands of miles away...

39:17.021 --> 39:18.591
...I find you.

39:18.756 --> 39:21.930
The King of Hell.

39:22.560 --> 39:25.700
And not by luck or accident.

39:25.864 --> 39:27.741
You made that happen.

39:29.234 --> 39:31.236
All by yourself.

39:32.737 --> 39:36.617
You're not a mother. You can't know
what that pride felt like.

39:36.774 --> 39:38.378
How huge it was.

39:39.944 --> 39:43.790
But can you try to imagine, for me?

39:45.416 --> 39:49.023
Now do you understand
why it breaks my heart...

39:49.187 --> 39:52.691
...to see what a colossal numbnut
you've become?

39:54.125 --> 39:57.595
You've got the crown,
but you're no ruler, not really.

39:58.129 --> 40:01.076
A sad, bored, wee boy on a throne...

40:01.232 --> 40:04.406
...who'll flop ass-up
the second those Winchesters...

40:04.569 --> 40:08.949
...hunters who'd as soon see you dead
as have you to tea, ask you to.

40:09.807 --> 40:12.549
You're no king. Not anymore.

40:19.784 --> 40:21.889
You're their bitch.

40:41.406 --> 40:42.441
Dean, um...

40:43.508 --> 40:45.954
...you know, what you did back there...

40:47.111 --> 40:48.249
...it was incredible.

40:49.681 --> 40:54.824
You know, if you can do that
without losing yourself...

40:55.353 --> 40:58.357
...that's cause for hope,
even without a cure.

40:59.857 --> 41:03.862
Yeah, maybe.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.503
So where's the blade?

41:13.004 --> 41:14.449
Somewhere safe.

41:15.940 --> 41:16.975
Good.

41:19.477 --> 41:23.448
Well, if you guys will excuse me, I think
I'm gonna go sleep for about four days.

41:24.615 --> 41:25.889
Of course.

41:39.530 --> 41:41.066
How is he?

41:44.669 --> 41:46.580
- Sam?
- Cass.

41:48.740 --> 41:50.651
Dean's in trouble.
