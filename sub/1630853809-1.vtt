No, I'm not okay with this at all.

-Uh, Nora, Frankie. Frankie, Nora.
-Nice to meet you.

04:19.041 --> 04:21.958
Nora, they're in The Loyal with me.
Frankie, we grew up together,

04:22.041 --> 04:23.958
and I was his babysitter.

04:24.041 --> 04:25.083
Okay. Okay.

04:25.166 --> 04:28.166
-Don't say that in front of everybody.
-Baby-faced Frankie.

04:28.250 --> 04:30.041
-You see what you did?

04:30.125 --> 04:32.916
Cassie was just telling me
how much she loves military boys.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.041
-Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Mmm.

04:35.125 --> 04:38.041
Uh, these are the guys.
We've two weeks 'til we ship out to Iraq.

04:38.125 --> 04:40.166
-We're still in Iraq?
-Not out yet.

04:40.250 --> 04:43.083

04:43.166 --> 04:44.750
-First one's on the house.
-Thank you.

04:44.833 --> 04:46.083
-Hey!
-Tequila?

04:46.166 --> 04:48.958
-Does he look old enough to drink tequila?
-Absolutely not.

04:49.041 --> 04:50.333
-Double that.
-Copy that.

04:50.416 --> 04:52.291
-I'll have a Coke.
-Mmm. Okay.

04:52.375 --> 04:54.166
-My kinda guy.
-Hell, yeah.

04:54.250 --> 04:56.166
Could you throw in
some lemon slices with that?

04:56.250 --> 04:58.375
How about you pace yourself, bro?

04:59.791 --> 05:01.208
Whoa!

05:01.291 --> 05:02.958
She's into you, bro.

05:05.458 --> 05:06.333
No.

05:06.916 --> 05:09.583
Okay? Just no.
It's not gonna happen, never.

05:09.666 --> 05:11.041
Just let it go, cheekbones.

05:11.625 --> 05:14.708
-What? You two?
-No, she's like an older sister to me.

05:14.791 --> 05:16.791
Uh, Cassie has
a "no soldiers" policy, sorry.

05:16.875 --> 05:19.125
-We're marines.
-What's that about?

05:19.208 --> 05:21.375
-Well, that means more of us for you then.
-Oh.

05:21.458 --> 05:22.958
-Tempting.

05:23.041 --> 05:24.833
-Let me check with my girlfriend.

05:24.916 --> 05:27.000
Uh, three tequilas and a coke.

05:27.083 --> 05:30.083
So we're good enough to fight
for your ass, but not enough to touch it?

05:30.166 --> 05:32.000
-Excuse me?
-Okay.

05:32.083 --> 05:34.541
I'll excuse you, this time.

05:34.625 --> 05:36.625
I can't with this.

05:36.708 --> 05:39.208
-Real smooth.
-What the hell? Come on. Bro.

05:41.541 --> 05:42.750
Let me see what I can do.

05:42.833 --> 05:45.125
Good luck, behave yourself.
Don't do what he did.

05:45.208 --> 05:47.166
Dude has
a perfect track record.

05:52.166 --> 05:56.375
Hey, I just wanted to apologize
for our friend. He's a bit…

05:57.875 --> 05:59.666
-Okay.

05:59.750 --> 06:02.541
Uh, I'm Luke, by the way.
What's your name?

06:04.000 --> 06:07.208
Your waitress/bartender.
Have a fun night, Luke.

06:11.541 --> 06:14.166
-You know, we're not all alike.
-Oh, really?

06:14.250 --> 06:15.250
Yeah.

06:15.333 --> 06:18.333
Because your friend is talking
about his right to touch my ass.

06:18.416 --> 06:20.875
Which apparently,
you also feel entitled to.

06:20.958 --> 06:23.375
Okay, we're just blowing off some steam.

06:23.458 --> 06:25.583
It's, uh…
It's actually a pretty big night.

06:25.666 --> 06:28.208
Last night on leave.
We ship off in a few weeks.

06:28.291 --> 06:31.958
I get it, but, uh, not really
an excuse for casual misogyny though.

06:32.041 --> 06:34.250
-You're cute and everything, but…

06:35.500 --> 06:37.916
Okay, all right. I, uh… I get this.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.125
What do you get?

06:39.208 --> 06:40.750
You. Yeah.

06:40.833 --> 06:41.666
-Me?
-Yeah, yeah.

06:41.750 --> 06:45.208
You're kind of predictable.
I've… I've met your type before. Yeah.

06:45.291 --> 06:46.791
Oh. Do tell.

06:46.875 --> 06:50.958
Drive a Lexus that your parents paid for,
but it's a hybrid, so it's okay.

06:51.041 --> 06:53.625
You… You probably tweet a lot
about other people's rights,

06:53.708 --> 06:54.916
but when it comes down--

06:55.000 --> 06:58.375
Sorry, it's just fascinating to me.
Do you have a PhD in mansplaining?

06:58.458 --> 07:00.625
When it actually comes down
to fighting for these rights,

07:00.708 --> 07:03.833
you don't wanna do anything, right?
'Cause guns are mean. You're a pacifist.

07:03.916 --> 07:07.750
I guess it's our job to go off
and fight those battles for you, right?

07:08.458 --> 07:11.500
I bet you have a little "peace-dove"
tattoo on your back to prove it.

07:11.583 --> 07:14.750
On my ass, actually.
Which you can't touch, but you can kiss.

07:15.541 --> 07:17.875
-Nailed it.

07:20.041 --> 07:22.583
Or they'll skip straight to chaotic evil.

07:22.666 --> 07:24.166
-Come back.

07:24.250 --> 07:26.458
You see the guy
that looks like he's 12 years old?

07:26.541 --> 07:28.666
He told me that I should reconsider
my stance on men,

07:28.750 --> 07:32.000
because if I marry him,
I would get incredible health insurance.

07:32.083 --> 07:34.125
Wow. Health insurance.

07:34.208 --> 07:36.541
-That's some dirty talk right there.
-So hot.

07:38.541 --> 07:41.541
-Where's that coming from?
-Mine. Made it annoying to not ignore it.

07:41.625 --> 07:42.583
Yes.

07:45.916 --> 07:47.750
Uh, hey, can you cover me for, like, five?

07:47.833 --> 07:50.125
-Yeah. You okay?
-You know.

08:27.666 --> 08:29.208
Shit.

08:43.875 --> 08:45.666
-Oh, it looks like

08:45.750 --> 08:49.333
I can't refill your prescription
for another four days.

08:51.083 --> 08:52.541
Uh, okay. Uh…

08:53.791 --> 08:56.416
I… I can't really wait four days. Um…

08:57.208 --> 09:01.125
Look, I'm out of my long-acting
and my short-acting insulin,

09:01.208 --> 09:04.166
and my reserve vial is basically gone,

09:04.250 --> 09:07.458
and it's just… it's really dangerous
for me not to have this.

09:07.541 --> 09:10.583
I mean, I can give you
a refill of your prescription

09:10.666 --> 09:12.166
if you wanna do it out of pocket.

09:12.250 --> 09:13.500
I don't think you understand--

09:13.583 --> 09:16.666
No, your insurance
is not renewed, so I cannot refill it.

09:16.750 --> 09:18.750
So, if you wanna do it out of pocket,
we can do that.

09:20.541 --> 09:23.208
And, um… how much is that?

09:24.750 --> 09:28.125
Three hundred for
the long-acting, 220 for the short-acting.

09:28.208 --> 09:30.500
So, a little over $500.
What do you wanna do?

09:30.583 --> 09:32.916
-Come on.
-I'm so sorry. I'll be right with you.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
-Ma, nothing.

09:35.083 --> 09:37.333
Check out in the other line.
This line already hates me.

09:37.416 --> 09:39.041
Do you wanna
step aside while…

09:39.125 --> 09:41.458
Can… you just give me a second?

09:45.833 --> 09:48.291
She speaks English too, thank you.

09:48.375 --> 09:49.208
Cassie!

09:51.500 --> 09:53.083
You take my cash. I'll do credit.

09:55.583 --> 09:57.458
-Ma!
-Always health first.

10:00.458 --> 10:01.583
Gracias.

10:01.666 --> 10:03.166
Okay, that worked out.

10:04.791 --> 10:06.041
Do you wanna fill this, hon?

10:08.416 --> 10:09.375
Oh.

10:12.500 --> 10:14.500
That is…

10:14.583 --> 10:15.458
Shoot.

10:15.541 --> 10:18.708
Guess I'll try
to make it to Friday without it.

10:20.416 --> 10:22.125
Thanks. Go Big Pharma.

10:34.875 --> 10:36.458
-What the hell?

10:39.875 --> 10:41.583
-Watch it!

10:54.000 --> 10:54.916
Shit.

11:11.083 --> 11:13.958
Hey, hey, hey! Get out of the way, "J."

11:14.958 --> 11:18.166
Yo! Those were some obstacle course moves
right there, kid. Whoop!

11:18.250 --> 11:20.500
-What the hell, Johnno?
-So is true, huh?

11:20.583 --> 11:22.625
I heard you joined the Marines.

11:23.625 --> 11:24.708
And I was like,

11:25.208 --> 11:28.958
"There's no way
that dude will pass a piss test."

11:34.208 --> 11:35.625
Right this way, soldier.

11:37.416 --> 11:38.791
Hop in, bro. Let's chill.

11:38.875 --> 11:41.166
-I got some good shit in my car.
-Nah. I can't.

11:41.250 --> 11:42.583
No. I'm, uh… I'm clean now.

11:42.666 --> 11:45.166
-You know, I gotta--
-Be a good boy for Uncle Sam.

11:45.250 --> 11:47.291
-Well, it seems like…

11:47.375 --> 11:51.500
…your life's in ship shape.
Except, uh, you owe me 15 grand.

11:52.666 --> 11:53.875
So, there's that.

11:55.041 --> 11:56.750
I need that money, bro.

11:56.833 --> 11:58.291
Don't worry, Johnno.

11:58.791 --> 12:01.166
I deploy next week.
So I'll get you something by then.

12:01.250 --> 12:03.458
Whew. Okay, that's good, bro. That's good.

12:03.541 --> 12:06.583
'Cause, uh…
'Cause if you're not good for it,

12:08.041 --> 12:09.791
I know where your family is.

12:10.625 --> 12:11.916
Arrgh!

12:19.125 --> 12:21.541
I'm playing with you, bro.

12:25.791 --> 12:27.791
-See you soon.

12:29.666 --> 12:31.375
-Shit!

12:36.958 --> 12:38.375
-Oh, good.
-Mm-hmm.

12:38.458 --> 12:41.625
-Cassie, you got a letter.
-Mom, don't open that.

12:43.250 --> 12:45.875
-Cass, you didn't pay your rent?
-I said don't open that.

12:47.541 --> 12:50.416
Your place is falling apart.
How can you live like this?

12:50.500 --> 12:53.750
Yeah, well, I'm busy, and the little
details aren't really a priority for me.

12:53.833 --> 12:57.625
-You cannot not pay your rent, Cassie.
-Well, I'm paying. I'm just paying late.

12:58.333 --> 13:00.500
I'm giving the landlord's daughter
free piano lessons.

13:00.583 --> 13:02.458
They're not going
to throw me out on the street.

13:03.333 --> 13:05.541
Why don't you move back with me?
You can share my bedroom.

13:05.625 --> 13:07.375
-Ma!
-Like when you were little.

13:07.458 --> 13:09.291
No, I'm not 12. I can't go backwards.

13:11.083 --> 13:14.666
Yes, but diabetes wasn't
really in the budget, okay?

13:14.750 --> 13:17.083
I'm so worried. Why are you laughing?

13:20.625 --> 13:23.291
You're not taking this seriously.
You could die at any moment.

13:23.375 --> 13:25.208
Mom! I know.

13:25.291 --> 13:27.416
I'm fine. I'm doing everything right.

13:27.500 --> 13:31.375
I'm bartending,
and delivering food, and playing gigs,

13:31.458 --> 13:33.750
and teaching piano on my spare time.

13:33.833 --> 13:36.333
And I'm constantly exhausted

13:36.416 --> 13:39.791
and running late, and I can't sleep
because I have this medical debt

13:39.875 --> 13:42.208
that just grows
like some mold in a basement.

13:42.291 --> 13:45.833
So, please, please just be kind to me.

13:52.500 --> 13:53.416
Okay. Fine.

13:53.500 --> 13:54.708
Ma.

13:54.791 --> 13:56.291
I'm okay. I know.

13:56.375 --> 13:57.416
I'm sorry.

13:57.500 --> 13:59.791
I should be able to provide for you.

13:59.875 --> 14:02.708
Mommy, I love you so much.
I don't want you to worry.

14:02.791 --> 14:05.541
You know me.
I'm just on my own weird journey,

14:05.625 --> 14:07.958
and it's… it's a little bumpy, but…

14:09.250 --> 14:10.375
…I love it.

14:12.041 --> 14:13.250
Thanks.

14:13.333 --> 14:14.250
I'm sorry.

14:14.333 --> 14:15.416

16:08.333 --> 16:09.375

16:09.458 --> 16:11.666

-Thank you.

16:31.208 --> 16:32.375
Oh my God.

16:34.500 --> 16:35.625
Get it together, Cass.

16:54.541 --> 16:55.541
Hello?

16:56.458 --> 16:57.958
-Frankie?

16:59.750 --> 17:02.708
Oh. Hello, you're not Frankie.

17:03.416 --> 17:07.083
So, what happens to the men in the future?
Is it a plague? Robot wars?

17:07.166 --> 17:09.958
Do you really wanna know?
It doesn't end well for the bros.

17:11.291 --> 17:12.791
Is that your car?

17:12.875 --> 17:14.583
My Lexus? Yeah.

17:15.500 --> 17:17.583
-Hi. Dude, the banners.
-Come on in.

17:17.666 --> 17:20.375
-Your parents are so proud.
-You know my momma.

17:24.375 --> 17:26.083
Would you mind giving us a minute?

17:27.958 --> 17:29.583
-Thanks.
-Of course.

17:30.166 --> 17:31.125
Aw.

17:31.208 --> 17:34.166
Hey. Yeah, uh, Mom's going
a little crazy with the goodbyes.

17:34.250 --> 17:36.375
Leave's over.
We're headed to base camp today.

17:36.458 --> 17:38.666
-Hey, you hungry? Want something?
-No, I'm good.

17:38.750 --> 17:40.708
So, what's the big question, girl?

17:40.791 --> 17:44.000
It's, uh… It's gonna sound a little crazy.

17:44.708 --> 17:45.583
I'm ready.

17:46.375 --> 17:47.791
I was wondering…

17:49.708 --> 17:52.583
I was hoping
that you might marry me.

17:52.666 --> 17:55.750
-What?
-I'm serious.

17:58.916 --> 18:00.000
Are you okay?

18:01.000 --> 18:02.875
Not exactly. Um…

18:04.333 --> 18:07.166
I found out six months ago
that I have diabetes.

18:07.250 --> 18:08.791
Type 1. And, uh…

18:08.875 --> 18:10.750
Get this. Uh, the insurance I have

18:10.833 --> 18:13.375
doesn't actually cover
the insulin that I need

18:14.208 --> 18:15.916
to like, live.

18:16.541 --> 18:19.166
So, I can either pay off my debt,

18:19.250 --> 18:21.125
or pay my rent, but I just…

18:22.208 --> 18:24.291
-I can't do both.
-I'm so sorry.

18:24.375 --> 18:27.458
And I'm like,
there's gotta be another way, right?

18:28.541 --> 18:30.958
Turns out there is.

18:31.041 --> 18:33.625
Your friend gave me the idea
when you guys came to the bar.

18:34.916 --> 18:36.875
Marine spouses get full health benefits.

18:36.958 --> 18:39.083
And we get extra pay
just for being married.

18:39.166 --> 18:41.125
Like basic housing allowance
and separation pay,

18:41.208 --> 18:42.833
which adds up to be pretty decent,

18:42.916 --> 18:45.875
and we could split it,
and everybody wins. What do you think?

18:47.583 --> 18:49.166
Take your time.

18:49.750 --> 18:51.000
I'm sorry.

18:51.083 --> 18:53.333
-My dad's a retired MP.
-Excuse me. Private discussion.

18:53.416 --> 18:55.583
MP is the Military Police.

18:55.666 --> 18:57.416
Frankie, this is a common scam.

18:57.500 --> 18:59.333
They kick the tires on these things,

18:59.416 --> 19:01.541
and if they find out
it's not real, it's fraud.

19:01.625 --> 19:03.916
Come on, man.
I mean, you're better than this.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.416
Okay, no one asked you, so could you not?

19:06.500 --> 19:10.375
-And why wouldn't this be a real marriage?
-I don't know, because you're not in love?

19:10.458 --> 19:13.708
Uh-- But we respect each other.
We're not in love, but we love each other.

19:13.791 --> 19:16.125
-We'd be able to sleep with other people,

19:16.208 --> 19:18.250
which sounds like
the healthiest marriage ever.

19:18.333 --> 19:19.750
You'd be ripping off the government.

19:19.833 --> 19:21.708
-I'd be ripping off the government?
-Yeah.

19:21.791 --> 19:24.625
The government that made
my mom pay taxes for ten years

19:24.708 --> 19:27.041
before giving her the right to vote?
That government?

19:27.125 --> 19:28.958
So your mom was living here
illegally then?

19:29.041 --> 19:31.583
Don't tell me you're
a resident of Southern California

19:31.666 --> 19:35.208
that does not see how this state was built
off the backs of illegal immigrants.

19:35.291 --> 19:38.625
Like my mom, who crossed that border,
lived here for ten years,

19:38.708 --> 19:43.708
worked their asses off for ten years,
paying taxes for your government,

19:43.791 --> 19:45.875
and were treated like less than citizens.

19:45.958 --> 19:49.000
Yeah, I will proudly
rip off the government.

19:49.583 --> 19:51.583
You got anything else to say, Commando?

19:51.666 --> 19:53.416
Dude, this is a trap.

19:54.541 --> 19:56.916
This will not end well for you.

20:00.250 --> 20:02.166
-I was just trying to help.
-Mmm.

20:03.166 --> 20:04.416
Thanks for your help.

20:08.500 --> 20:11.083
-Why is he even here?
-He's my bunkmate, okay?

20:12.666 --> 20:14.708
He's got nowhere else to stay
while we are on leave.

20:14.791 --> 20:16.000
Please play nice.

20:18.125 --> 20:18.958
So?

20:20.125 --> 20:21.208
Cass, I can't.

20:22.750 --> 20:24.291
Okay? I'm… I'm sorry.

20:25.500 --> 20:29.333
Plus, I don't think my girlfriend's
gonna understand me having a wife.

20:30.041 --> 20:31.833
What? You got back together with Riley?

20:33.041 --> 20:35.750
Yeah. Yeah. I'm… I'm all in.

20:35.833 --> 20:38.291
I remember when you met her,
like, in fifth grade.

20:38.875 --> 20:39.708
That's great.

20:42.708 --> 20:45.208
Well, that was crazy.

20:45.291 --> 20:46.500
I should go.

20:47.708 --> 20:51.041
There are tourists to be shuttled
and food to be delivered.

20:51.125 --> 20:53.708
-Cass, you know if I had the money--
-No, Frankie, stop.

20:53.791 --> 20:54.916
I'll figure it out.

20:58.500 --> 21:00.708
-Stay safe, okay?
-Yeah, you too.

21:00.791 --> 21:01.958
-Bye.

21:03.541 --> 21:04.708
Her parents can't help?

21:05.583 --> 21:06.458
Yeah, um…

21:07.250 --> 21:10.500
Her mom's a nursing assistant, so it's
not like there's anything extra leftover.

21:10.583 --> 21:13.416
Dad dipped out when she was born.
Sounds like he was a bad dude.

21:13.500 --> 21:15.166
-That explains a lot.

21:15.250 --> 21:18.958
-Hey! Are you trying to sneak up on me?

21:19.041 --> 21:20.250
Gonna make my going-away plate.

21:20.333 --> 21:23.041
-Let's go get some food!

21:42.416 --> 21:44.500
Come here. Give me a kiss. Bye.

21:44.583 --> 21:45.666
All right, see ya.

21:47.666 --> 21:49.416
Bye, Grandpa.

21:55.041 --> 21:56.708
-Love you.

22:00.500 --> 22:02.625
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:07.333 --> 22:10.583
-Uncle Luke? What are you doing?

22:10.666 --> 22:12.333
-Think fast.
-Yeah, you are.

22:12.416 --> 22:13.500
You ready? You ready?

22:14.416 --> 22:15.666
Give me the ball.

22:17.458 --> 22:19.375
-No, me. No, me. No, me.
-Me.

22:21.458 --> 22:23.625
Mom, I found Uncle Luke hiding.

22:23.708 --> 22:25.083
-Oh my… Luke?
-Busted.

22:25.166 --> 22:27.375
We didn't think
we'd see you before deployment.

22:27.458 --> 22:30.041
-What?
-Hi, Hailey.

22:30.125 --> 22:32.916
Wow. It's like hugging
a tree trunk.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.458
I didn't think it was possible
to get so buff in eight months.

22:35.541 --> 22:37.791
What do you think, Spence?
Should I join the Marines?

22:37.875 --> 22:40.250
-Yeah. Yes.
-Should I get all ripped like Uncle Luke?

22:40.333 --> 22:42.250
-Yes!

22:49.083 --> 22:50.500
You, uh…

22:51.791 --> 22:54.250
-You look just like Dad with that haircut.

22:55.208 --> 22:56.166
Gimme a hug.

22:56.916 --> 22:59.000
-Bring it in.
-Good to see you, man.

23:00.875 --> 23:02.000
Where's he been?

23:03.041 --> 23:05.833
You know, Dad's off for the day,
so you can breathe.

23:09.708 --> 23:12.875
I think he doesn't wanna see me
even more than I don't wanna see him.

23:12.958 --> 23:15.083
The man would have to express
some kinda emotion

23:15.166 --> 23:16.833
for me to know how he's feeling about you.

23:16.916 --> 23:19.750
-He made it clear when he cut me off.
-Come on, Luke.

23:19.833 --> 23:22.750
Dad had to draw the line somewhere.
You were so out of control.

23:22.833 --> 23:23.666
Yeah.

23:31.625 --> 23:32.958
What's going on, Luke?

23:38.875 --> 23:40.125
I owe some money.

23:45.166 --> 23:47.291
We've been here before, and you know…

23:48.208 --> 23:49.416
You know I can't help you.

23:49.500 --> 23:51.625
Yeah. No, no, I… I know.

23:51.708 --> 23:54.291
Is it that
piece of shit Johnno, again?

23:54.375 --> 23:57.208
-What happens if you don't pay?
-Not paying isn't an option.

23:57.750 --> 24:00.083
-He better not come near my family.
-I'm sorry.

24:00.166 --> 24:02.000
-I'm just in a bad spot.
-Mm-hmm.

24:21.416 --> 24:24.166
I… I just got my pay,
so this isn't everything.

24:24.750 --> 24:27.500
-But I'll get the rest to you soon.
-Like when?

24:28.250 --> 24:29.708
I'm losing my patience.

24:29.791 --> 24:31.958
I waited for you
through your stupid rehab,

24:32.041 --> 24:33.458
and now you're shipping out of town,

24:33.541 --> 24:36.875
showing up with a coupla hundred bucks
when you owe me 15 grand?

24:36.958 --> 24:39.875
-I think I've got a plan.
-You better explain.

24:42.375 --> 24:44.208
Just take it easy, man.

24:44.291 --> 24:46.625
Don't make me use this. You gotta pay me.

24:46.708 --> 24:48.125
Hear me out. I'm gonna pay you.

24:48.208 --> 24:49.708
-I… I know how.
-How?

24:49.791 --> 24:51.708
I met this girl
who needs health insurance.

24:51.791 --> 24:54.458
And if we get married, I get extra money
each month from the military.

24:54.541 --> 24:55.833
I'll give you my cut. Okay?

24:55.916 --> 24:59.041
-You sure?
-Yeah, I'm sure. It's gonna be fine.

24:59.125 --> 24:59.958
So be smart.

25:00.041 --> 25:01.375
This better work.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.250
Enjoy your honeymoon.

25:20.541 --> 25:21.500
Hi.

25:21.583 --> 25:23.208
-Hi.
-Thanks for meeting with me.

25:23.958 --> 25:26.708
Is your dad in the parking lot
waiting to cuff me?

25:26.791 --> 25:28.333
Funny.

25:33.791 --> 25:35.541
You're acting kinda sus.

25:35.625 --> 25:38.208
Yeah. Well, if we do this, if…

25:38.291 --> 25:41.875
We need to be very careful.
All right? We need a story.

25:41.958 --> 25:44.000
You and I didn't get along
at the bar the other night.

25:44.083 --> 25:46.208
The others saw that, but the next night,

25:46.291 --> 25:50.125
I was very charming and persistent,
and I convinced you to go out with me.

25:50.208 --> 25:51.208
-You did?
-Mm-hmm.

25:51.291 --> 25:53.833
Was it hot?
When you asked me out?

25:53.916 --> 25:54.750
Very.

25:56.833 --> 25:58.916
I'm sorry. I'm just gonna
need you to explain yourself,

25:59.000 --> 26:02.625
because a week ago you were lecturing me
on how this is fraud, so…

26:02.708 --> 26:06.083
-It is fraud. I don't wanna do this.
-Okay, so… don't.

26:06.166 --> 26:08.541
Believe me. If I had
any other choice, I wouldn't be.

26:08.625 --> 26:12.083
Marriage should be for love.
And where I come from, it's for life.

26:13.083 --> 26:15.583
Do you come from a fantasy land?

26:15.666 --> 26:20.083
Because, where I come from
in reality, marriage is really just

26:20.166 --> 26:24.041
a pointless legal arrangement
that turns lovers into enemies, so…

26:24.916 --> 26:27.375
-Why don't you have another choice?
-How's that your business?

26:27.458 --> 26:30.458
Kind of is. I am possibly
about to marry you. Why?

26:31.458 --> 26:33.583
I need the extra
two grand a month married guys get.

26:33.666 --> 26:36.208
That's it?
And I'm supposed to trust you here?

26:36.291 --> 26:38.875
Trust me? Okay. Look, if I can trust a lib

26:38.958 --> 26:41.666
who doesn't give a shit about the law
or the military, I can sure--

26:41.750 --> 26:44.750
I have an ethical code
that doesn't include blind obedience,

26:44.833 --> 26:47.833
and I desperately need this
to literally survive.

26:47.916 --> 26:50.166
Whereas you could be, I don't know,

26:50.250 --> 26:52.750
stockpiling supplies for your bro-militia.

26:52.833 --> 26:55.875
I'm leaving.
This was a mistake. "Bro-militia."

26:55.958 --> 26:58.125
-Luke. Luke.
-Liberal nut.

26:58.208 --> 26:59.375
What?

26:59.458 --> 27:01.125
-Look, I don't like you.

27:01.208 --> 27:02.041
No shit.

27:02.125 --> 27:04.958
But you seem solid. So…

27:06.625 --> 27:08.250
I'm sorry, okay?

27:08.333 --> 27:09.375
Please.

27:15.208 --> 27:18.250
Listen. I need you to know
what you're getting yourself into.

27:18.333 --> 27:20.291
If we're caught, I get court-martialed.

27:20.875 --> 27:23.416
As in, arrested and maybe doing time.

27:23.500 --> 27:24.583
Okay.

27:24.666 --> 27:27.041
Look, this is already gonna be
a shotgun wedding.

27:27.125 --> 27:28.416
We're gonna be on their radar.

27:28.500 --> 27:31.000
So, once I get over there, to Iraq,

27:32.416 --> 27:35.291
we've… we've got to just, like,
set up consistent times

27:35.375 --> 27:36.750
where we are gonna speak, okay?

27:36.833 --> 27:38.833
We gotta make this look normal,
like a real marriage.

27:38.916 --> 27:41.958
We'd have to write some romantic emails
in case somebody reads them.

27:42.041 --> 27:44.291
We just have to keep it tight for my tour.

27:44.375 --> 27:46.250
And once I'm back here,
we file for divorce.

27:46.333 --> 27:49.333
And that gives you
a year of free health insurance.

27:49.416 --> 27:51.666
And we can split the cash down the middle.

27:51.750 --> 27:52.750
-Yeah?
-Great.

27:54.458 --> 27:58.000
And one more small thing.
I deploy Friday morning.

27:58.083 --> 28:00.083
We'd also have to go out with my company.

28:01.375 --> 28:03.500
Act like we…

28:03.583 --> 28:05.333
-Like we like each other.

28:06.083 --> 28:09.083
Yeah, more than that.
Like, love each other.

28:09.666 --> 28:11.375
And, um…

28:13.125 --> 28:16.166
So, all married couples spend the night
at this motel near base.

28:16.250 --> 28:18.708
-It means we would have to.
-Super.

28:21.333 --> 28:24.666
So, are we out of "if" territory?

28:26.583 --> 28:27.541
Are we doing this?

28:28.416 --> 28:29.250
Yeah.

28:30.666 --> 28:31.833
Yeah, we're doing this.

28:31.916 --> 28:34.000
But you can't tell anybody
that doesn't need to know.

28:34.083 --> 28:35.208
You have to promise.

28:35.875 --> 28:36.958
I promise.

28:37.625 --> 28:38.625
In fact,

28:39.125 --> 28:40.375
I pinky swear.

28:41.791 --> 28:44.541
-No, I'm not doing that.
-We're getting married, man.

28:55.125 --> 28:55.958
I'll text you.

29:39.833 --> 29:40.916
-No.
-What?

29:41.000 --> 29:42.375
You can't wear that.

29:42.458 --> 29:44.708
-Why?
-Because we're taking wedding photos.

29:44.791 --> 29:46.833
You have to dress a certain way.

29:46.916 --> 29:48.583
-Really?
-No. I'm coming up.

29:52.833 --> 29:55.625
There's no fluffy virgin
white wedding dress in there, Commando.

29:55.708 --> 29:56.583
Stop calling me that.

30:08.833 --> 30:10.375
Make yourself comfortable.

30:19.583 --> 30:20.666
Do you play?

30:22.000 --> 30:23.583
No, it's just to impress guys.

30:26.416 --> 30:27.583
I'm a musician.

30:27.666 --> 30:28.666
It's what I do.

30:28.750 --> 30:31.916
My band and I have been
working at it for like, five years.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.375
That's gotta be rough.

30:33.458 --> 30:36.083
Rough would be punching the clock
at some soul-sucking job

30:36.166 --> 30:38.125
while I'm just making the rich richer.

30:38.208 --> 30:40.250
I'd rather hustle for my art any day.

30:44.666 --> 30:47.333
-Uh…
-Uh, hi.

30:49.125 --> 30:50.875
So, what does the tattoo say?

30:50.958 --> 30:53.333
-"Socialism Now"?

30:53.416 --> 30:54.791
You're really clever.

30:54.875 --> 30:57.333
No, it says…

30:57.416 --> 31:00.916
-Someone, something, I--
-Risk nothing, gain nothing.

31:01.000 --> 31:05.000
It's something my grandma said to my mom
when she moved to America.

31:05.791 --> 31:07.041
Hello, my prince.

31:07.125 --> 31:10.375
Today is the day that our credit scores
shall become intertwined.

31:29.750 --> 31:31.625
You know, you really look the part.

31:31.708 --> 31:34.583
-What does that mean?
-You look pretty.

31:35.083 --> 31:37.833
Your blushing bride.

31:38.666 --> 31:41.500
Ahh! You look so beautiful!
Congratulations.

31:41.583 --> 31:43.500
-Thank you.
-Come on, give me a hug.

31:43.583 --> 31:45.041
We're so proud of you.

31:45.125 --> 31:47.125
This is the best day of my life.

31:47.208 --> 31:50.083
Oh my goodness. This is so exciting.

31:56.041 --> 31:57.750
Hi. Thank you for coming.

31:57.833 --> 31:58.875
Of course.

31:59.708 --> 32:00.666
Oh, did you get rings?

32:01.291 --> 32:02.333
-Uh…
-Here.

32:08.083 --> 32:10.000
Oh my God, you bought a real ring?

32:10.875 --> 32:12.000
-Well--
-Me.

32:12.541 --> 32:13.375
I did.

32:14.458 --> 32:16.000
-What?
-I got it for Riley.

32:17.208 --> 32:19.625
-I've been saving up since I enlisted.
-Frankie.

32:21.791 --> 32:23.333
No, I can't accept this.

32:23.916 --> 32:26.458
I didn't wanna ask her now
and then just ship out.

32:26.541 --> 32:28.916
Like, I wanna be her husband.

32:29.583 --> 32:30.791
You know, do it right.

32:31.375 --> 32:34.750
And… And Mom wants me to wait 'til I'm 21,
when I get back, so, uh…

32:35.375 --> 32:37.000
Just keep it warm for me.

32:38.916 --> 32:41.000
Luke Morrow and Casandra Salazar.

32:43.458 --> 32:44.375
Shit.

32:59.750 --> 33:01.708
We are gathered here today

33:01.791 --> 33:04.750
to join you two together
in lawful matrimony.

33:05.333 --> 33:07.083
And your witness today?

33:07.166 --> 33:08.250
Frankie.

33:08.333 --> 33:10.291
That's me. How ya doing?

33:10.375 --> 33:12.041
-Hi, Frankie.
-Hiya.

33:12.125 --> 33:14.625
Luke Morrow, do you pledge
to love this woman,

33:14.708 --> 33:16.375
to be true and loyal to her,

33:16.458 --> 33:19.125
and to comfort and keep her
in sickness and in health?

33:19.708 --> 33:20.541
I do.

33:22.333 --> 33:25.166
Casandra Salazar, do you pledge
to love this man,

33:25.250 --> 33:27.000
to be true and loyal to him,

33:27.083 --> 33:30.208
and to comfort and keep him
in sickness and in health?

33:31.458 --> 33:32.375
I do.

33:35.125 --> 33:38.041
By the power vested in me
by the great State of California,

33:38.125 --> 33:41.208
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

33:45.750 --> 33:47.458
You may kiss the bride.

33:52.291 --> 33:53.708
Congratulations.

33:54.916 --> 33:58.666
Drink up, boys!
Here's to the second platoon, baby!

33:58.750 --> 34:01.375
-Shipping out tomorrow.

34:01.458 --> 34:03.333
-On one!
-Click it! Get in there.

34:03.416 --> 34:04.333
No shit!

34:10.375 --> 34:11.750
-Whoo!
-Wait, wait, wait!

34:11.833 --> 34:14.666
-And to the newlyweds!
-Adorable.

34:14.750 --> 34:15.833
Ah!

34:15.916 --> 34:18.833
-Considering you hated each other.
-Look at you, guys.

34:18.916 --> 34:20.708
-Thank you.

34:20.791 --> 34:23.625
-Newlyweds!

34:23.708 --> 34:25.583
Dude,
I can't believe you married her,

34:25.666 --> 34:27.541
and you're shipping out the next day.

34:28.125 --> 34:29.583
How are you doing?

34:30.416 --> 34:32.791
-You know, a-about them leaving so soon?

34:32.875 --> 34:36.333
I'm… kind of freaking out.

34:36.416 --> 34:37.875
Yeah, it's, um…

34:39.333 --> 34:40.791
it's extremely surreal.

34:40.875 --> 34:42.541
I'm gonna miss him so much.

34:42.750 --> 34:44.541
I know Frankie's nervous.

34:44.625 --> 34:48.291
So I'm trying really hard to be brave.
But he's my favorite person.

34:48.375 --> 34:50.875
-That's the problem.
-Oh. Uh…

34:50.958 --> 34:53.166
Sorry.

34:54.875 --> 34:56.000
-I'm a mess.

34:56.083 --> 34:58.208
Come on, get 'em up.
I'd like to make another toast.

34:58.291 --> 35:01.416
-This one is to life, love,

35:01.500 --> 35:04.625
and hunting down some goddamn Arabs, baby!

35:04.708 --> 35:06.333
-Whoo!

35:06.916 --> 35:08.708
Really? Oh boy.

35:09.875 --> 35:10.958
Yeah!

35:13.916 --> 35:15.375
You got a problem with that?

35:16.916 --> 35:17.875
Yeah, you.

35:18.916 --> 35:20.750
It's just--

35:22.500 --> 35:25.375
Arab is an ethnicity,
and you're making it sound

35:25.458 --> 35:27.958
like you're hunting down
everyone of a certain ethnicity.

35:28.041 --> 35:30.291
-Which sounds kind of problematic.
-Yeah, Cassie.

35:30.375 --> 35:32.208
He gets it. He's just stirring the pot.

35:32.791 --> 35:35.541
Thank you
for the sensitivity training. All right?

35:35.625 --> 35:37.625
I'm out here serving my country.
What are you doing?

35:37.708 --> 35:39.750
I don't know.
Apparently, I'm telling a marine

35:39.833 --> 35:41.541
he shouldn't be hunting down Arabs.

35:41.625 --> 35:42.916
-Okay. No, no.
-Let it go.

35:43.000 --> 35:44.791
And what exactly
would you like us to do, huh?

35:44.875 --> 35:46.791
Go over there and teach them pronouns?

35:50.208 --> 35:53.791
How about starting with knowing
who your actual enemy is,

35:53.875 --> 35:56.416
and not making disturbing generalizations.
How about that?

35:56.500 --> 35:58.208
You watch your tone. Luke, get your girl.

35:58.291 --> 35:59.833
-Stop.
-Excuse me?

35:59.916 --> 36:01.916
-He doesn't "get" me.
-Yeah, he does.

36:02.000 --> 36:03.666
That's enough! Both of you.

36:05.208 --> 36:06.583
Sit down.

36:06.666 --> 36:08.208
Do what the man says.

36:08.791 --> 36:10.000
Now.

36:14.791 --> 36:16.791
-Thank you.
-You too, man.

36:19.875 --> 36:23.125
God, I just love
nuanced conversations like these.

36:34.583 --> 36:36.333
I should go check on my husband.

36:37.583 --> 36:41.916
-What the hell?
-Oh, man. Those two are fiery.

36:43.208 --> 36:45.458
-You're this mad, really?
-Yeah.

36:46.125 --> 36:47.500
You know what he meant.

36:48.083 --> 36:50.083
Okay, it's all bullshit bravado.

36:50.166 --> 36:52.250
And look, Armando is a dick.

36:52.750 --> 36:56.875
But I… I don't think you understand what
we're preparing ourselves to go and do.

36:56.958 --> 36:59.250
Is it really worth
ruining everybody's night for?

36:59.333 --> 37:01.166
I'm sure I wasn't the one
who ruined the night.

37:01.250 --> 37:03.750
I'm sure it was your friend
shouting, "Kill all Arabs."

37:03.833 --> 37:06.666
What, 'cause you were gonna have
the best night if he didn't say that?

37:06.750 --> 37:09.291
Sitting at a table
full of people you feel superior to.

37:09.375 --> 37:12.125
Not being a racist troll
is kinda superior though, isn't it?

37:12.208 --> 37:13.916
Okay, yeah, but without guys like Armando,

37:14.000 --> 37:16.875
do you really think this country
would be safe from terrorists?

37:16.958 --> 37:19.666
No, look, and you preach,
"The future is female."

37:19.750 --> 37:21.458
How do you think those women feel in Iraq?

37:21.541 --> 37:22.500
You live in this bubble.

37:22.583 --> 37:24.458
-I can't stand it.
-No, you're right.

37:24.541 --> 37:28.916
Because the obvious solution is guns.
Send over a bunch of men with guns!

37:29.000 --> 37:31.541
Wow,
they're off to a great start.

37:31.625 --> 37:33.458
-Perfect. Guns. What?
-They see us. Come here.

37:33.541 --> 37:35.458
-I said they can see us, come here.
-Okay.

37:35.541 --> 37:39.041
-Yeah, well, couples fight, dude--
-You are so goddamn stubborn, just…

37:46.208 --> 37:48.291
Working through our differences.

37:49.916 --> 37:51.416
-Okay?

37:51.916 --> 37:53.541
-Still looking.
-Mm-hmm.

37:57.750 --> 37:58.583
Yeah.

37:58.666 --> 38:00.791
-Keep holding me.

38:01.625 --> 38:02.833
So in love.

38:06.166 --> 38:08.833
See? They're hugging.
They're fine now.

38:10.791 --> 38:11.666
We're good.

38:12.875 --> 38:13.708
Yep.

38:15.666 --> 38:16.583
Good.

38:24.416 --> 38:26.583
-Last night, baby!

38:26.666 --> 38:28.333
Ah, make it count, fellas!

38:28.416 --> 38:30.708
-Let's go big tonight!
-In bed! Whoo!

38:30.791 --> 38:31.833
I love you, girl!

38:33.458 --> 38:35.541
Giddy up! Giddy up!
Come on!

38:38.833 --> 38:40.750
-Good night.
-Night.

38:40.833 --> 38:42.625
Have fun in the honeymoon suite!

38:45.583 --> 38:47.500
-Nice one.

38:50.208 --> 38:54.458
-Huh. I… I asked for two beds.
-Mm-hmm.

38:55.791 --> 38:56.958
Sure.

38:57.750 --> 38:58.833
Sure you did.

39:00.666 --> 39:03.125
All right, 'cause, what?
Y-You think I'm into you?

39:03.208 --> 39:04.541
Maybe a little.

39:04.625 --> 39:06.875
-Just breathe, dude.
-Well, 'cause I'm not.

39:06.958 --> 39:09.500
-All I know is you're a hot mess.
-What is that supposed to mean?

39:09.583 --> 39:13.250
I don't know, because a normal person
would just admit that they're scared.

39:13.333 --> 39:15.458
I'm not scared. I'm not scared.

39:15.541 --> 39:17.791
Okay. Well then,
what's with the tough guy act?

39:17.875 --> 39:20.541
You're bossing me around,
telling me to sit down.

39:20.625 --> 39:22.125
Please, stop.

39:22.208 --> 39:24.875
I can't do this.
I'm not doing this. Big mistake.

39:25.000 --> 39:26.916
You're right.

39:29.500 --> 39:30.625
I'm scared.

39:31.250 --> 39:36.000
Between the marriage and Iraq,

39:36.083 --> 39:37.583
I'm kind of losing it.

39:41.500 --> 39:42.541
Uh…

39:46.000 --> 39:47.208
I'm sorry.

39:52.208 --> 39:55.541
Hey, you'd be
absolutely crazy if you weren't.

39:59.375 --> 40:01.541
That was really brave.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.166
I should wash up.

40:17.500 --> 40:18.875
Cassie…

40:39.625 --> 40:40.791
Is this okay?

40:42.000 --> 40:43.041
Yes.

41:39.916 --> 41:42.791
-How long have you been up?
-Since- 00 a.m.

41:42.875 --> 41:44.083
I went for a run.

41:44.166 --> 41:46.375
You went for a run
at three in the morning?

41:46.458 --> 41:48.625
-I couldn't sleep.
-What?

41:48.708 --> 41:51.166
You heard me.
I… I couldn't sleep at all.

41:51.250 --> 41:53.875
So, I went for a run. That's what I do.

41:55.625 --> 41:56.833
So, you're that guy?

41:58.416 --> 42:00.333
Pretend-it-didn't-happen guy.

42:00.416 --> 42:03.125
I don't know what you want from me.
I just have a lot on my mind.

42:03.208 --> 42:04.875
-Okay.
-We've gotta go to deployment.

42:04.958 --> 42:06.250
So I'll take you to base.

42:07.000 --> 42:08.125
Great.

42:19.916 --> 42:23.333
I've lived in Oceanside my whole life,
and I've never been on base.

43:28.500 --> 43:30.041
Hey, I love you, man.

43:39.041 --> 43:40.125
I gotta go.

43:41.291 --> 43:44.583
Hey, Cassie, anything happens to me,
you're my next of kin, okay?

43:44.666 --> 43:48.083
You can call my brother.
Tell him about our deal.

43:48.166 --> 43:50.166
You'll have to make up a story for my dad.

43:50.250 --> 43:53.000
But please, my dad
cannot know about this. All right?

43:53.083 --> 43:53.958
Okay.

43:54.041 --> 43:56.000
Lance Corporal Morrow,
congratulations.

44:00.708 --> 44:03.375
Remember, from here on out,
we're being watched, all right?

44:03.958 --> 44:06.208
Emails, video calls, everything.

44:16.833 --> 44:19.958
-NCOs, move those men. Let's go!

44:32.250 --> 44:34.875
Hey guys, one more time for the newlyweds!

44:34.958 --> 44:37.708
Hey! Come here, girl!
Let's get her. Let's get her.

44:37.791 --> 44:39.833
-Come on, one last one.

44:39.916 --> 44:41.916
-Pick her up.

44:42.000 --> 44:43.416
Oh, oh, oh!

44:47.916 --> 44:49.666
-Here we go.

44:49.750 --> 44:50.875
There we go.

44:50.958 --> 44:52.583
Come get your bride!

44:52.666 --> 44:53.916
I'm sorry.

44:54.000 --> 44:58.166
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

44:58.250 --> 45:01.166
-Come on, get in there, Luke.
-Kiss! Kiss!

45:07.458 --> 45:09.416
That's your last one
for a long time.

45:09.500 --> 45:10.916
Okay.

45:11.000 --> 45:13.250
All right, love birds.
Let's go.

45:13.333 --> 45:14.375
Let's move it.

45:17.500 --> 45:19.166
Take care of yourself, okay?

45:19.250 --> 45:21.500
I want a hit record
when I come back, all right?

45:21.583 --> 45:22.708
-Yep.
-Just for you.

45:22.791 --> 45:26.000
Bravo Company, on the bus! Let's move!

45:27.833 --> 45:29.041
Congratulations.

45:29.625 --> 45:30.458
Thanks.

45:39.541 --> 45:41.250
This doesn't even feel real.

46:32.583 --> 46:33.666
Dear Luke.

46:34.458 --> 46:36.375
We fell in love so quickly.

46:37.791 --> 46:39.958
I figured I'd write you
and fill in the gaps

46:40.041 --> 46:42.166
that we didn't have time to fill.

46:43.250 --> 46:44.708
So…

46:45.458 --> 46:47.375
Here's what you need to know about me.

46:47.458 --> 46:49.083
-Oh!

46:50.291 --> 46:51.583
♪ Hoping… ♪

46:51.666 --> 46:52.833
Music is…

46:52.916 --> 46:54.750
♪ Come back home… ♪

46:54.833 --> 46:55.791
…my everything.

46:55.875 --> 46:57.416
♪ Come back home ♪

46:57.500 --> 46:59.875
♪ Come back home ♪

46:59.958 --> 47:05.041
I started as a kid just singing to myself
to drown out what was going on at home.

47:05.541 --> 47:07.666
My mom had a string
of boyfriends from the base

47:07.750 --> 47:09.708
who did nothing but make her miserable.

47:09.791 --> 47:15.083
We didn't talk about it. She, uh…
She thought I didn't notice, but I did.

47:15.166 --> 47:17.791
So while most people learn
to speak their feelings out loud

47:17.875 --> 47:22.000
or write them into a journal,
I learned to make mine into music.

47:22.083 --> 47:24.458
My whole life, I've loved to sing,

47:24.541 --> 47:28.125
but I'm kind of terrified
to sing what I have to say.

47:28.208 --> 47:29.583
-…feel a squeeze.

47:30.583 --> 47:33.708
So I sing covers. I hide behind
someone else's words instead.

47:33.791 --> 47:37.291
Ironic since I have been told
I'm more than opinionated.

47:37.375 --> 47:40.750
It's just every time I sit down
to write something original,

47:40.833 --> 47:43.625
making a living and all my medical
problems get in the way.

47:43.708 --> 47:46.291
Maybe that's a cop-out,
but I guess now that we're married,

47:46.375 --> 47:47.416
I'll find out.

47:49.375 --> 47:51.916
Dear Cassie,
here's what you should know about me.

47:52.416 --> 47:54.916
I'm a third-generation marine.

47:55.500 --> 47:57.458
My grandpa fought
in the battle of Iwo Jima,

47:57.541 --> 47:59.041
and my dad got a Purple Heart

47:59.125 --> 48:01.750
for being injured in combat
in Desert Storm.

48:02.541 --> 48:05.500
After high school, I kind of spun out.

48:06.500 --> 48:09.333
I thought that by enlisting,
I could earn back my dad's respect.

48:09.416 --> 48:11.416
But now, that I'm actually here,

48:11.500 --> 48:13.541
I'm starting to understand
I'm not doing it for him.

48:13.625 --> 48:15.041
I'm doing it for me.

48:15.125 --> 48:18.166
To serve my country
and to, uh, be a better man.

48:20.291 --> 48:23.250
Hey, Luke, it's your boy, Johnno.
I got last week's deposit.

48:23.333 --> 48:26.291
Keep faking that marriage.
That shit's crazy.

48:26.375 --> 48:29.083
Anyway, get me this week's.
Keep 'em coming.

48:30.208 --> 48:33.083
You know those freak thunderstorms
they get by the beach?

48:33.166 --> 48:35.625
-They used to scare the shit out of me.

48:36.750 --> 48:39.208
My dad was a hard-ass about it,

48:39.291 --> 48:42.333
but I remember once,
he let my brother and me

48:42.416 --> 48:45.541
bring our sleeping bags in
and crash on the floor.

48:45.625 --> 48:48.916
Our family like that, all together,
when it was storming out,

48:49.500 --> 48:50.625
it's one of my best memories.

48:51.291 --> 48:53.333
Not long after that, my mom got sick,

48:53.416 --> 48:56.458
and my dad retired from the Corps
to take care of her.

48:56.541 --> 48:58.875
He went to every single one
of her chemo appointments.

48:59.791 --> 49:03.166
Sat up all night by her bed
when she went to the hospital at the end.

49:03.791 --> 49:06.000
Hmm. That's what love means to me.

49:08.083 --> 49:09.750
I guess that's what I want for us.

49:09.833 --> 49:11.500
My dear husband.

49:11.583 --> 49:13.250
Car ride over plane ride.

49:13.333 --> 49:16.750
Breakfast tacos over late-night tacos,
with lots of hot sauce.

49:16.833 --> 49:18.291
Lots of it.

49:18.375 --> 49:21.833
I've never left California,
but my dream is to circle the globe

49:21.916 --> 49:23.500
with my band someday.

49:23.583 --> 49:26.083
If I were home more,
I'd have a pet iguana.

49:26.166 --> 49:28.416
Shut up. They're highly intelligent.

49:28.916 --> 49:31.000
My darling wife.

49:31.083 --> 49:35.208
Nothing ruins a taco more than hot sauce.
It totally kills the flavor.

49:35.291 --> 49:38.291
Someday I'm going to run a marathon
in every major city.

49:38.375 --> 49:40.333
That's how I'm going to see the world.

49:40.416 --> 49:45.041
And I don't mean to burst your bubble,
but an iguana isn't in the cards for us.

49:47.500 --> 49:51.416
The only pet I've ever had
was a goldfish I won at the state fair.

50:01.416 --> 50:02.750
Hey, can you, uh…

50:02.833 --> 50:05.458
-Can you see me?
-Yeah. Uh, can you see me?

50:06.125 --> 50:08.166
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

50:08.666 --> 50:09.583
Hi.

50:10.333 --> 50:11.166
Hi.

50:12.541 --> 50:14.666
Oh, your, uh, your best friend is here.

50:15.375 --> 50:17.333
-You remember my wife?
-Yeah.

50:17.416 --> 50:19.583
I remember. The love birds.

50:21.333 --> 50:22.458
Hi!

50:22.541 --> 50:24.458
-Riley says, "What's up?"
-Hi, Riley.

50:24.541 --> 50:26.125
-Hey, Cassie.
-How is it?

50:26.208 --> 50:28.583
Uh, you know,
I got sand in my butt crack, so.

50:31.166 --> 50:32.166
Sounds fantastic.

50:33.416 --> 50:36.625
So, how was your day, babe?

50:37.500 --> 50:39.000
Uh, it was fine.

50:39.916 --> 50:40.916
Babe.

50:41.000 --> 50:42.250
I, um…

50:42.916 --> 50:44.208
I worked,

50:44.291 --> 50:47.250
and I started to write a song.

50:47.333 --> 50:49.708
Wait, you just wrote a song?
Like, just like that?

50:49.791 --> 50:51.916
-Hey, Cassie, play it for us!
-Play it for us!

50:52.000 --> 50:53.458
Play it! Play it!

50:53.541 --> 50:54.666
-Play it!

50:54.750 --> 50:56.166
-Play it! Play it!
-Come on!

50:56.250 --> 50:58.125
I mean, it's not… it's not finished.

50:58.208 --> 50:59.208
Play it for us!

50:59.291 --> 51:00.375
-Please.
-Come on!

51:00.458 --> 51:03.541
Look, I'm hoping the song will be finished
in, like, a week.

51:04.833 --> 51:05.875
Come on.

51:05.958 --> 51:07.333
-Okay, okay.

51:07.416 --> 51:10.250
I promise. Guys,
I promise I'll sing it for you guys then.

51:10.833 --> 51:14.666

54:18.791 --> 54:19.708
I think we needed that.

54:19.791 --> 54:21.625
Be safe out there, guys.

54:24.333 --> 54:25.708
What's happening with the demo?

54:25.791 --> 54:28.208
I posted it, and

54:28.791 --> 54:31.500
I sent it to, like, a dozen small labels.

54:31.583 --> 54:33.583
-Okay. They're gonna love it.
-Actually…

54:33.666 --> 54:37.250
this, um, indie music site did a review
of one of our last gigs

54:37.333 --> 54:41.541
that was just, like, insanely positive,
and I guess this booker read it.

54:42.166 --> 54:45.958
And now, we have a slot
at the Oceanside Alt-Fest.

54:46.041 --> 54:47.250
What?

54:47.333 --> 54:50.583
Like, the Oceanside Alt-Fest!

54:50.666 --> 54:52.833
That's crazy! You…
You're doing the damn thing.

54:52.916 --> 54:56.833
Wait, so does this mean
that I'm, like, your muse? No?

54:56.916 --> 54:59.166
Really? Let me think about it.

55:00.625 --> 55:02.000
Okay, maybe just a little.

55:02.083 --> 55:04.416
Good luck at the concert. Bye.

55:05.875 --> 55:08.666
-

55:08.750 --> 55:10.500
Oceanside Alt-Fest fans,

55:10.583 --> 55:14.291
the musical lineup will be starting
on the main stage in just a moment.

55:15.625 --> 55:17.833
Ladies and gentlemen,
put your hands together

55:17.916 --> 55:23.291
for Oceanside's very own
Cassie Salazar and The Loyal.

55:23.375 --> 55:26.041
-How we feeling, Oceanside?

55:27.000 --> 55:28.125
Oh my God!

55:29.708 --> 55:31.583
God! This is unreal.

55:31.666 --> 55:33.708
-Hi!
-Whoo!

55:33.791 --> 55:36.083
To all the brave men and women
who are serving our country

55:36.166 --> 55:37.750
on the other side of the world.

55:38.291 --> 55:39.291
Thank you.

Get hold of your gear.
Make sure you have your magazines loaded.

57:52.833 --> 57:54.666
-Make sure your gear is prepped.

57:54.750 --> 57:56.708
Tomorrow we're going on patrol.

57:56.791 --> 57:59.708
And I want everything ready for tomorrow.
Everybody understands?

58:00.291 --> 58:01.625
Yes, sir.

58:01.708 --> 58:04.541
All of ya,
I need your head on a swivel tomorrow.

58:04.625 --> 58:06.250
-No messing around.

58:26.458 --> 58:29.625
Luke, I tried you three times.
What's going on?

58:29.708 --> 58:31.750
You have reached Luke. Leave a message.

58:31.833 --> 58:32.666
Okay. Uh…

58:33.166 --> 58:37.166
Hi. So I posted one of the tracks
from my Oceanside Alt-Fest show,

58:37.250 --> 58:39.166
the one that I played for you on Spotify,

58:39.250 --> 58:41.541
and it got picked up
for the Road Trip playlist,

58:41.625 --> 58:44.458
and now it has over 200,000 plays.

58:45.041 --> 58:49.166
Luke, the song you may or may not
have influenced has literally gone viral.

58:49.833 --> 58:52.833
That's it. Bye, muse.

58:58.083 --> 58:59.958
-Whoo! Yeah!
-Hi, sir!

59:00.041 --> 59:01.583
-Lovely day, right?
-Yeah.

59:02.166 --> 59:03.791
It's a great day today!

We are so famous.

59:45.916 --> 59:48.208
-Eddie?

59:48.291 --> 59:50.500
Oh my God, Cass, your phone is blowing up.

59:50.583 --> 59:53.291
-What?

59:54.333 --> 59:55.416
Germany?

59:57.333 --> 59:58.875
This is amazing, you guys.

1:00:01.250 --> 1:00:02.958
Sorry, guys, I gotta take this.

1:00:03.041 --> 1:00:04.583
-Who is it?
-Don't know.

1:00:04.666 --> 1:00:07.625
-Just like five minutes, okay?
-Better be a record deal.

1:00:10.708 --> 1:00:11.750
Hello?

1:00:11.833 --> 1:00:13.916
Yes.
Is this Casandra Salazar?

1:00:15.125 --> 1:00:16.125
Yes.

1:00:16.208 --> 1:00:18.000
Yes, ma'am,
this is Captain Curtis,

1:00:18.083 --> 1:00:20.541
Rear Detachment Commander
for the 1st Battalion, 1st Marines.

1:00:20.625 --> 1:00:24.083
Ma'am, I'm calling because your husband
has been wounded in action.

1:00:24.166 --> 1:00:26.875
He's going to be transferred from Germany

1:00:26.958 --> 1:00:29.416
to the Naval Medical Center in San Diego.

1:00:30.625 --> 1:00:31.666
Is he okay?

1:00:32.250 --> 1:00:35.291
His legs were injured
during an IED detonation.

1:00:35.375 --> 1:00:36.750
He's currently undergoing surgery.

1:00:36.833 --> 1:00:38.291
No, this isn't happening.

1:00:38.375 --> 1:00:40.375
Sorry, but I'm having
a hard time understanding you.

1:00:45.208 --> 1:00:46.041
Shit!

1:01:02.291 --> 1:01:03.375
Jacob Morrow.

1:01:05.208 --> 1:01:06.875
Jacob Morrow.

1:01:08.125 --> 1:01:09.833
Luke's brother, I'll find you.

1:01:52.000 --> 1:01:52.916
Can I help you?

1:01:54.666 --> 1:01:56.833
-I'm looking for Jacob Morrow.
-You found him.

1:02:00.375 --> 1:02:03.333
Is Luke's brother here by any chance?
It's important.

1:02:03.416 --> 1:02:05.750
I'm Luke's father. What's he done?
What's he done now?

1:02:07.250 --> 1:02:09.625
-I really need to talk to his brother.
-Stop.

1:02:10.875 --> 1:02:12.708
Cut the shit. What do you want?

1:02:12.791 --> 1:02:15.833
Is Luke in jail? He owe you money? What?

1:02:16.958 --> 1:02:18.708
Luke was wounded in combat.

1:02:20.166 --> 1:02:22.375
Sir. He's in Iraq.

1:02:22.458 --> 1:02:24.416
-Or he was in Iraq.
-Wh--

1:02:24.500 --> 1:02:27.333
-He deployed a couple of months ago.
-Hang on.

1:02:27.416 --> 1:02:29.583
I didn't even know he had enlisted.

1:02:31.916 --> 1:02:33.916
-How bad is he?
-I haven't seen him.

1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:37.083
The Marines called me last night,
and they said that…

1:02:38.250 --> 1:02:41.666
…that his legs had been shattered,
uh, by some kind of IED.

1:02:41.750 --> 1:02:42.958
Ah, Jesus.

1:02:43.041 --> 1:02:44.375
And that he would be here

1:02:45.166 --> 1:02:47.166
in a couple of days.

1:02:48.291 --> 1:02:51.333
-I'm so sorry.
-Why'd they call you?

1:02:57.375 --> 1:02:58.750
I'm his wife.

1:03:04.041 --> 1:03:05.208
Surprise.

1:03:07.041 --> 1:03:08.541
I'm sorry, come on in.

1:03:22.208 --> 1:03:23.875
Lance Corporal Morrow?

1:03:23.958 --> 1:03:26.125
Back to U.S. soil.
You look a little dizzy.

1:03:26.208 --> 1:03:28.083
Lance Corporal Morrow?

1:03:28.166 --> 1:03:30.416
So, your skin grafts
were successful,

1:03:30.500 --> 1:03:33.208
but I'm gonna keep you on this wound vac
for a week to help you heal.

1:03:33.291 --> 1:03:34.791
Right now, your family's here.

1:03:34.875 --> 1:03:37.541
You lean on them,
you'll be on the mend before you know it.

1:03:40.416 --> 1:03:41.541
Right over here.

1:03:46.666 --> 1:03:47.500
Luke.

1:03:52.791 --> 1:03:53.875
Dad?

1:03:53.958 --> 1:03:56.375
Oh my God. Jeez, man,
we could have lost you.

1:03:56.916 --> 1:03:59.541
You could've told us
you got married.

1:03:59.625 --> 1:04:01.458
Yeah, congratulations.

1:04:01.541 --> 1:04:03.000
-Thanks.

1:04:05.916 --> 1:04:06.791
Hi.

1:04:07.666 --> 1:04:08.916
-Hi, babe.
-Hi.

1:04:15.583 --> 1:04:17.833
I'm… I'm so sorry, honey.

1:04:17.916 --> 1:04:20.416
I never thought I'd see you
in the Corps.

1:04:20.500 --> 1:04:22.791
I hear you're getting a Purple Heart.

1:04:22.875 --> 1:04:25.041
-Yeah.
-That's an honor.

1:04:25.750 --> 1:04:28.000
You told Jake not to tell me you enlisted.

1:04:29.166 --> 1:04:32.500
Why? Why did you have to lie to me again?

1:04:35.250 --> 1:04:37.375
You'd have said I didn't think it through.

1:04:40.041 --> 1:04:42.208
I hope to get the chance
to prove you wrong.

1:04:42.708 --> 1:04:44.083
Yeah, me too.

1:04:47.791 --> 1:04:50.958
So, how we doing?
Give me the rundown, Doctor.

1:04:52.083 --> 1:04:55.500
Look, this is going to be a long rehab,
and he's starting from zero.

1:04:55.583 --> 1:04:58.916
-Doctor, will he be able to run again?
-It's combat medicine, you know.

1:04:59.000 --> 1:05:01.500
Let's get you walking first.
Then we can talk about running.

1:05:01.583 --> 1:05:02.708
Thank you.

1:05:03.750 --> 1:05:05.166
Well, your mom would, uh…

1:05:06.958 --> 1:05:09.625
Your mother would've been heartbroken
to see you like this.

1:05:16.250 --> 1:05:18.416
Hey. Let's give them a minute.

1:05:18.500 --> 1:05:19.791
Yes, sir.

1:05:19.875 --> 1:05:20.791
Thanks.

1:05:28.583 --> 1:05:31.083
-I, uh…

1:05:32.916 --> 1:05:34.708
I went to the wrong Jacob Morrow.

1:05:34.791 --> 1:05:37.666
I'm so sorry.
I… I was just scared for you--

1:05:37.750 --> 1:05:39.291
You've got to be kidding me, Cassie.

1:05:39.375 --> 1:05:42.166
What were you thinking?
We are totally screwed.

1:05:42.250 --> 1:05:43.833
I told you he was Military Police.

1:05:43.916 --> 1:05:45.708
You failed to mention
your dad and your brother

1:05:45.791 --> 1:05:47.416
have the same frickin' name, Luke.

1:05:47.500 --> 1:05:50.708
-It's fine. It's fine.

1:05:50.791 --> 1:05:54.000
We'll just get a divorce,
and you'll never have to see me again.

1:05:54.083 --> 1:05:57.625
No, no, no, he doesn't trust me already.
He's already watching us.

1:05:57.708 --> 1:06:00.958
-No, he won't turn in his own son.
-You have no idea.

1:06:01.708 --> 1:06:04.250
Even though he's retired,
he still acts like a cop.

1:06:04.333 --> 1:06:06.958
Gotta keep it together. A couple months
until I get back on my feet.

1:06:07.041 --> 1:06:10.041
We'll live together
just till I'm done with supervised PT.

1:06:10.125 --> 1:06:11.916
W-We'll be off the radar. All right?

1:06:12.000 --> 1:06:15.458
Until then, we have to make them believe
this is a real marriage.

1:06:15.541 --> 1:06:17.416
-Luke, a couple of months?

1:06:17.875 --> 1:06:19.041
Wha-- I don't--

1:06:19.125 --> 1:06:21.833
-What… What does that mean exactly?
-We act like married people.

1:06:21.916 --> 1:06:22.875
Pretend.

1:06:22.958 --> 1:06:25.416
All right?
You can do that. You can do that.

1:06:25.500 --> 1:06:26.750
Pretend, all right?

1:06:34.708 --> 1:06:38.083
-It's gonna be fine.
-It is. We're gonna play house.

1:06:42.000 --> 1:06:45.416
Is Frankie gonna laugh or cry
when he finds out about this?

1:06:49.666 --> 1:06:50.583
Shit.

1:06:52.875 --> 1:06:53.875
What?

1:06:54.583 --> 1:06:56.375
-No one told you?
-What?

1:06:59.208 --> 1:07:00.791
Frankie, he's, um…

1:07:02.666 --> 1:07:04.500
The same mission as this. He, uh…

1:07:06.000 --> 1:07:07.375
He didn't make it, Cassie.

1:07:07.458 --> 1:07:08.541
No.

1:07:11.625 --> 1:07:13.916
I'm sorry, I--

1:07:14.416 --> 1:07:15.791
I can't be here.

1:07:23.666 --> 1:07:26.166
Local Oceanside resident
Frankie Mubuthia

1:07:26.250 --> 1:07:28.375
has been killed in the line of duty.

1:07:28.458 --> 1:07:30.583
He was 20 years old.

1:07:31.250 --> 1:07:35.166
His family says that they are proud
of his heroism and sacrifice

1:07:35.250 --> 1:07:36.791
in the name of freedom.

1:07:36.875 --> 1:07:40.250
His funeral will be held
at Fort Rosecrans in San Diego.

1:08:03.875 --> 1:08:06.208
-Aim. Fire.

1:08:06.291 --> 1:08:07.208
Aim.

1:08:56.833 --> 1:08:58.500
-Hi.

1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:00.833
The service was beautiful.

1:09:07.291 --> 1:09:09.708
Frankie bought this for you.

1:09:14.083 --> 1:09:16.291
He was waiting to propose
until he came home,

1:09:16.375 --> 1:09:18.583
and he asked me to keep it safe.

1:09:20.958 --> 1:09:23.708
But I know that he really
would have wanted me to give this to you.

1:09:28.041 --> 1:09:29.416
It fits you perfectly.

1:09:32.583 --> 1:09:34.083
He loved you so much.

1:10:01.625 --> 1:10:03.041
Hospital staff…

1:10:07.958 --> 1:10:10.541
-What's he doing here?
-I have no idea.

1:10:11.083 --> 1:10:12.833
Lance Corporal Morrow, congratulations.

1:10:12.916 --> 1:10:15.416
Sounds like y'all are headed home.
Y'all live near the base?

1:10:15.500 --> 1:10:16.416
Oh. Uh…

1:10:16.500 --> 1:10:19.250
It all happened so fast
we didn't really get a chance--

1:10:19.333 --> 1:10:21.500
-We didn't really live together. Yeah.
-Yeah.

1:10:21.583 --> 1:10:23.833
Oh boy. Well, you will now.

1:10:25.541 --> 1:10:26.375
Yeah.

1:10:27.250 --> 1:10:28.625
Yeah.

1:10:29.291 --> 1:10:30.166
Yeah.

1:10:30.250 --> 1:10:33.333
I'll be taking care of you.

1:10:33.416 --> 1:10:35.250
Cassie, listen. I'll swing by the house,

1:10:36.500 --> 1:10:38.791
pick Luke up,
and take him to PT two times a week.

1:10:38.875 --> 1:10:40.708
-Oh-- Yeah.
-Oh. No, you don't have to do that.

1:10:40.791 --> 1:10:42.958
Come on. It'll be great
to reconnect with my son.

1:10:43.041 --> 1:10:45.250
Hear all about your whirlwind romance.

1:10:47.666 --> 1:10:50.708
-Wow.
-You really, really don't have to do that.

1:10:50.791 --> 1:10:52.291
I heard you the first time.

1:10:53.333 --> 1:10:55.708
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

1:10:58.833 --> 1:11:00.000
I'll see you soon.

1:11:06.500 --> 1:11:08.458
Good lord.

1:11:12.750 --> 1:11:14.791
Nice and easy. Easy, buddy.

1:11:14.875 --> 1:11:16.541
-Hold up for a second.
-Is it okay?

1:11:17.708 --> 1:11:18.958
Home sweet home, bro.

1:11:19.041 --> 1:11:21.916
-You're living in a three-story walk-up.
-Is there an elevator?

1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:24.916
-Ah, nope.
-Lance Corporal Morrow. Here we go.

1:11:25.000 --> 1:11:26.875
I'm gonna get one step ahead of you.

1:11:28.083 --> 1:11:30.291
You're gonna need our help
with the stairs for sure.

1:11:30.375 --> 1:11:33.875
Yep. We'll invite you in
next time. Thank you all so much. Bye.

1:11:45.750 --> 1:11:47.166
Oh.

1:11:47.250 --> 1:11:48.875
You're a runner too, huh?

1:11:48.958 --> 1:11:50.500
It's a glucose gel.

1:11:51.250 --> 1:11:54.583
I have diabetes, remember?
The reason we're married.

1:11:54.666 --> 1:11:58.125
Oh, speaking off,
our wedding night was memorable,

1:11:58.208 --> 1:12:00.125
but we gotta set some boundaries here.

1:12:00.708 --> 1:12:01.625
Got it.

1:12:04.833 --> 1:12:05.875
I'll take the couch.

1:12:14.791 --> 1:12:17.625
I think there's
some leftover Thai food in the fridge.

1:12:17.708 --> 1:12:19.291
I can't guarantee that it won't kill you.

1:12:19.375 --> 1:12:21.791
Oh, and I should warn you
I'm not gonna be cooking for you--

1:12:21.875 --> 1:12:23.916
-You're freaking out.
-Oh, what? And you're not?

1:12:24.000 --> 1:12:25.916
I mean, I've never even lived
with a guy before.

1:12:26.000 --> 1:12:27.666
Oh, no, no, no. I'm… I'm feeling super.

1:12:27.750 --> 1:12:29.583
Stuck in a wheelchair three stories up.

1:12:29.666 --> 1:12:32.666
Well, is this what's happening? Right now?
Like, we're just living together?

1:12:32.750 --> 1:12:35.083
With your dad coming
in and out of my apartment

1:12:35.166 --> 1:12:37.333
judging if I pass the wife test?

1:12:37.416 --> 1:12:40.083
Because this isn't
what we agreed to.

1:12:40.166 --> 1:12:42.958
Well, I'm sorry that my injury
is inconveniencing you.

1:12:43.041 --> 1:12:46.375
-It must be so, so hard for you.
-Don't put this on me, Luke.

1:12:46.458 --> 1:12:48.333
You can't be happy about this.

1:12:48.416 --> 1:12:51.500
Like, am I really the person
you want taking care of you right now?

1:12:51.583 --> 1:12:54.083
No, no, no, you are not
taking care of me. Please, don't.

1:12:54.166 --> 1:12:57.166
-Well, you're living with me!
-To avoid a court-martial!

1:12:57.250 --> 1:13:00.458
What don't you understand about that?
You could be charged too.

1:13:02.583 --> 1:13:04.041
Jesus!

1:13:07.250 --> 1:13:08.541
Let's just get through this.

1:13:09.416 --> 1:13:10.375
Super.

1:13:10.958 --> 1:13:12.083
Super.

1:13:21.416 --> 1:13:23.625
Jake just said that
Dad's gonna be here in 20.

1:16:54.208 --> 1:16:57.083
That's a sweet beach house
you and your fake wife got.

1:16:57.833 --> 1:16:59.541
Is that why you haven't been paying me?

1:17:00.416 --> 1:17:01.791
'Cause, uh, since you're married,

1:17:01.875 --> 1:17:04.416
technically your wife,
she owes me now too.

1:17:12.458 --> 1:17:13.750
Yeah, Cass!

1:17:23.041 --> 1:17:24.458
-Hi.

1:17:25.458 --> 1:17:26.875
You're back early.

1:17:26.958 --> 1:17:27.916
Yeah.

1:17:28.000 --> 1:17:30.583
-Okay, well, I'm, uh… I'm almost done.
-No rush.

1:17:34.416 --> 1:17:36.541
Look at you.
Doing so much better.

1:17:36.625 --> 1:17:38.791
Yeah.

1:17:39.625 --> 1:17:40.666
Slowly, slowly.

1:17:42.750 --> 1:17:45.166
-Hold up, girl.

1:17:45.250 --> 1:17:46.583
Hey, Jake, you get a dog?

1:17:47.291 --> 1:17:48.416
You crazy?

1:17:49.125 --> 1:17:50.125
She's for you.

1:17:50.916 --> 1:17:53.458
Her name is Peaches
because she's from Georgia.

1:17:56.250 --> 1:17:57.625
Peaches, hi!

1:17:58.208 --> 1:17:59.750
Sit.

1:17:59.833 --> 1:18:02.041
Paw! Good girl!

1:18:02.125 --> 1:18:04.458
See? We got training
and everything already done for you.

1:18:05.041 --> 1:18:07.458
We read that dogs can be really helpful

1:18:07.541 --> 1:18:09.916
for guys like you,
healing from injuries like yours.

1:18:10.000 --> 1:18:12.000
-Oh, really?
-I read it.

1:18:12.833 --> 1:18:16.708
-Then she texted me.
-I don't need you plotting behind my back.

1:18:18.500 --> 1:18:21.208
Well, too bad, because it's good for you.

1:18:27.416 --> 1:18:29.416
Guys like me?

1:18:30.958 --> 1:18:33.166
Guys like me. What? Like a cripple?

1:18:33.250 --> 1:18:35.166
I don't need your pity.

1:18:35.250 --> 1:18:36.791
All right, have it your way!

1:18:36.875 --> 1:18:39.000
Listen, I know what's good for me.

1:18:39.083 --> 1:18:41.041
I can make decisions for myself.

1:18:42.958 --> 1:18:44.833
People don't say
"cripple" anymore.

1:18:44.916 --> 1:18:45.916
This is bullshit.

1:18:46.000 --> 1:18:47.958
You know, it's okay
to accept help sometimes.

1:18:48.041 --> 1:18:49.291
What the hell, Luke?

1:18:50.708 --> 1:18:53.666
-See? Peaches gets it.

1:18:53.750 --> 1:18:56.791
-Fine, I'll take her.

1:18:56.875 --> 1:18:59.541
-Good girl, Peaches. Good girl.

1:19:14.916 --> 1:19:17.833
Luke? Hey, Peaches, where's Luke?

1:19:19.208 --> 1:19:20.375
Hello?

1:19:20.958 --> 1:19:21.958
-Luke?

1:19:25.833 --> 1:19:27.041
Oh my God.

1:19:27.583 --> 1:19:29.125
-You're walking.
-Barely.

1:19:30.333 --> 1:19:32.833
Hurts like a bitch.

1:19:33.416 --> 1:19:36.208
-You know, apparently, I'm a psychic.
-Oh yeah?

1:19:36.291 --> 1:19:39.208
Because though I would usually
just get myself breakfast tacos.

1:19:39.291 --> 1:19:42.833
This morning I woke up, and I thought,
"I wonder if Luke deserves one?"

1:19:42.916 --> 1:19:44.625
-Oh. One?
-Oh, calm down.

1:19:44.708 --> 1:19:46.333
I got way too many.

1:19:46.416 --> 1:19:48.916
I even got our dog a taco.

1:19:49.000 --> 1:19:50.541
-Right, Peaches. Yeah.

1:19:55.791 --> 1:19:57.291
Did you fix the doorknob?

1:19:57.916 --> 1:19:58.916
Mm-hmm.

1:20:02.208 --> 1:20:03.791
Thanks, I guess.

1:20:03.875 --> 1:20:07.166
You know you can let a guy help you
and still be a feminist, right?

1:20:07.250 --> 1:20:11.708
I'd rather have a broken knob
than have you lecture me on feminism.

1:20:11.791 --> 1:20:14.416
Oh, okay, so you wanna live
on an island of broken doorknobs?

1:20:14.500 --> 1:20:16.375
Why don't you say, "Luke, you're wrong."

1:20:16.458 --> 1:20:18.583
-"You don't understand me."
-Luke, you're wrong.

1:20:18.666 --> 1:20:20.375
-You don't understand me.
-I'm not.

1:20:20.458 --> 1:20:23.041
Really? Well, I'm doing okay on my own.

1:20:23.125 --> 1:20:27.041
Maybe I don't need the chaos
of someone having my heart or whatever.

1:20:27.125 --> 1:20:28.250
Hmm.

1:20:31.250 --> 1:20:33.250
Oh no. No more tacos if you do that.

1:20:35.500 --> 1:20:37.583
-Do what?
-"Hmm."

1:20:37.666 --> 1:20:38.916
Just say the damn thing.

1:20:41.416 --> 1:20:44.958
Okay. The same reason you and I
wouldn't work. You don't believe in love.

1:20:46.875 --> 1:20:51.083
Wow, I had no idea that Psych 101
was part of basic training.

1:20:51.166 --> 1:20:55.416
Well, you realize I'm a marine, right?
So, the training is not exactly basic.

1:20:55.500 --> 1:20:56.833
Oh yeah, I've seen the movies.

1:20:56.916 --> 1:20:59.916
I've done my homework.
I'm a proud military wife, after all.

1:21:00.000 --> 1:21:03.291
You don't wanna date
a guy that you actually like

1:21:03.375 --> 1:21:05.833
because that would mean, you know,
you'd have to give up control

1:21:05.916 --> 1:21:06.750
and let someone in.

1:21:06.833 --> 1:21:08.958
Okay, yeah.
Well, maybe having control issues

1:21:09.041 --> 1:21:10.583
just means that I'm being smart.

1:21:10.666 --> 1:21:13.208
So maybe you don't know
what you're talking about.

1:21:13.291 --> 1:21:15.500
Mmm, that's fake news.

1:21:15.583 --> 1:21:19.208
Because when it comes
to control issues, I'm self-taught.

1:21:19.291 --> 1:21:20.625
You?

1:21:20.708 --> 1:21:22.041
You seem so chill.

1:21:22.125 --> 1:21:25.041
Listen, it's this,
or I'm breaking six laws,

1:21:25.125 --> 1:21:28.666
going 120 down the 405
with no pants on. So…

1:21:31.625 --> 1:21:33.000
Metaphorically?

1:21:36.375 --> 1:21:37.958
Hard to picture.

1:21:39.750 --> 1:21:42.333
Not that I'm picturing it.

1:21:42.416 --> 1:21:43.375
Okay.

1:21:45.666 --> 1:21:48.125
What kind of freak
skips out on the Tapatío?

1:21:48.208 --> 1:21:49.958
-Wow.

1:21:50.041 --> 1:21:54.625
You know, you snowflakes
are just-- You're so judgy.

1:21:55.666 --> 1:21:57.458
-Don't start this.

1:21:58.083 --> 1:22:01.041
-Okay, control freak, you ready to let go?

1:22:01.125 --> 1:22:02.708
-Hell yeah.
-Drive on the wild side?

1:22:02.791 --> 1:22:04.125
-Bring it on.
-Pants down?

1:22:04.208 --> 1:22:06.541
-Are you ready for this?
-Yeah.

1:22:08.333 --> 1:22:10.166
Bring it on.

1:22:12.833 --> 1:22:14.166
-Ready?
-Yeah.

1:22:14.250 --> 1:22:15.208
On three.

1:22:15.291 --> 1:22:18.041
One. Two. Three.

1:22:23.541 --> 1:22:25.958
Do you wanna spit it out?

1:22:26.041 --> 1:22:27.958
It's not spicy.

1:22:35.916 --> 1:22:36.875
Oh my G--

1:22:38.375 --> 1:22:39.375
Can't breathe.

1:22:39.458 --> 1:22:40.958
No, I'm totally fine.

1:22:41.541 --> 1:22:42.750
-I go--
-Spit it out!

1:22:43.875 --> 1:22:45.458
-No!
-You're gonna lose.

1:22:47.583 --> 1:22:49.291
Okay, I can't.

1:22:49.375 --> 1:22:50.375
-Agh!

1:22:50.458 --> 1:22:52.208
-Victory is mine!
-Oh my God.

1:22:52.291 --> 1:22:54.625
I'm bleeding from my eyes.
I'm bleeding from--

1:22:55.833 --> 1:22:57.041
Yes!

1:22:57.125 --> 1:22:59.500
-Oh wow.

1:22:59.583 --> 1:23:00.916
I won.

1:23:01.000 --> 1:23:02.750
-You lost.
-I got something for you.

1:23:02.833 --> 1:23:06.041
It's in my back pocket.
Gimme one second. Here it is, right there.

1:23:06.125 --> 1:23:07.416
-Ah!

1:23:07.500 --> 1:23:11.125
-I'm in pain. I'm in so much pain.

1:23:11.208 --> 1:23:13.708
-You are sweating. Here.

1:23:13.791 --> 1:23:15.083
Oh.

1:23:15.166 --> 1:23:16.791
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

1:23:18.083 --> 1:23:20.833
Why would anyone do that to themselves?
I don't understand.

1:23:21.375 --> 1:23:23.750
-You're sweating too.
-No.

1:23:24.375 --> 1:23:26.333
This isn't sweat. This is a glow.

1:23:32.416 --> 1:23:34.916
Maybe we should watch
a movie or something.

1:23:35.000 --> 1:23:39.000
I can smell the jalapeños
coming out of your pores. So, uh…

1:23:39.083 --> 1:23:41.333
Maybe you take a shower first.

1:23:43.083 --> 1:23:44.000
Well…

1:23:44.750 --> 1:23:47.708
Getting in the shower means
standing up for a long period of time,

1:23:47.791 --> 1:23:50.333
which means radiating pain.

1:23:50.416 --> 1:23:52.791
Okay, then take a bath?

1:23:52.875 --> 1:23:56.416
-It's gonna just make you feel better.
-Getting in the tub is also a nightmare.

1:24:19.666 --> 1:24:20.666
Here.

1:24:43.958 --> 1:24:44.916
It's not pretty.

1:24:53.000 --> 1:24:56.083
-I can do that myself.
-Just let me.

1:25:05.083 --> 1:25:07.333
I see how hard
you've been working at it,

1:25:07.416 --> 1:25:10.041
and you'll run again, Luke.

1:25:11.416 --> 1:25:12.916
I believe in you.

1:25:27.666 --> 1:25:29.791
Why don't you sleep in the bed tonight?

1:25:54.958 --> 1:25:56.041
Hi, Peaches.

1:25:58.166 --> 1:26:00.750
-Hi, good girl.
-Hey, baby. Okay.

1:26:00.833 --> 1:26:03.583
Yeah, you wanna go that way,
all right.

1:26:04.875 --> 1:26:07.041
God, I haven't been back here
in so long.

1:26:07.125 --> 1:26:09.291
Remember, my dad doesn't trust me.

1:26:09.375 --> 1:26:11.583
-He's gonna be watching everything.
-Dude, don't worry.

1:26:11.666 --> 1:26:15.416
I mean, look at us. We're so cute
and suburban, it's disgusting.

1:26:15.500 --> 1:26:16.791
Come on, Peaches!

1:26:18.333 --> 1:26:21.583
Okay, guys, I want you to listen
to a song. All right, ready for this?

1:26:27.000 --> 1:26:29.041
She's my new favorite artist.

1:26:29.125 --> 1:26:31.125
-I hate you.
-What?

1:26:31.208 --> 1:26:33.958
-I like this song.
-Uncle Luke, play football with me.

1:26:34.041 --> 1:26:35.708
-You bossing me around?
-Yeah.

1:26:35.791 --> 1:26:37.500
-Okay.
-Come on, Uncle Luke.

1:26:37.583 --> 1:26:40.291
No, he's got an injury, little man.
Let your uncle take it easy.

1:26:40.375 --> 1:26:42.375
-Take it easy?
-Uncle Luke's hurt.

1:26:42.458 --> 1:26:44.250
Take it easy?
Oh, heck, no. All right.

1:26:44.333 --> 1:26:46.250
-You sure?
-You're my walking stick.

1:26:46.333 --> 1:26:47.833
-Be careful.
-She's right.

1:26:47.916 --> 1:26:49.875
-Yeah.
-Hey, let me see that ball.

1:26:50.375 --> 1:26:51.750
-Oh! Nice throw!
-Oh!

1:26:51.833 --> 1:26:54.875
-I guess we're doing this. Yeah.

1:26:54.958 --> 1:26:56.708
Are y'all thinking about having kids?

1:26:58.166 --> 1:26:59.041
Uh…

1:26:59.125 --> 1:27:03.583
Hey, Hailey, let her be
a rock star first, okay?

1:27:04.125 --> 1:27:05.000
Kids later.

1:27:05.083 --> 1:27:07.375
-♪ You can try to hide it ♪
-Well…

1:27:07.458 --> 1:27:09.875
He… He's really great with kids.

1:27:09.958 --> 1:27:11.500
-No, me!
-Look at him.

1:27:11.583 --> 1:27:12.458
-Who first?
-Me!

1:27:12.541 --> 1:27:14.458
-Here you go, Luke. Oh!
-All right. Oh!

1:27:14.541 --> 1:27:15.833
You throw it back.

1:27:15.916 --> 1:27:17.791
-Twenty-two! Hut!

1:27:17.875 --> 1:27:20.750
I love the way you look at him.
It's just so real.

-Who's this?
-This is Cassie's mother.

1:27:59.166 --> 1:28:00.625
Where is Cassie? I cannot reach her.

1:28:00.708 --> 1:28:03.375
She… She's at work.
Is everything okay?

1:28:07.208 --> 1:28:08.458
-Marisol?
-Huh?

1:28:08.541 --> 1:28:10.666
Hi, I'm Luke Morrow.
I'm Cassie's friend. You all right?

1:28:10.750 --> 1:28:12.666
-Yeah, I'm fine.
-Okay, what happened?

1:28:12.750 --> 1:28:16.875
Uh, uh, I don't know. Someone broke
the door and broke the window, I think.

1:28:16.958 --> 1:28:18.500
There's glass everywhere and-- Oh!

1:28:18.583 --> 1:28:20.791
-I… I thought you had a show.
-Thank you for coming.

1:28:22.583 --> 1:28:24.583
It's been 30 minutes
since I called the police.

1:28:24.666 --> 1:28:26.666
-They don't rush for this neighborhood.
-Oh, come on.

1:28:26.750 --> 1:28:28.250
-Welcome to the ugly truth.
-Ma'am.

1:28:28.333 --> 1:28:30.041
Give me your keys. I'm gonna check it out.

1:28:30.125 --> 1:28:32.208
-There could be someone in there.
-It's gonna be fine.

1:28:32.291 --> 1:28:34.541
Cassie, you stay with your mom. All right?

1:29:20.000 --> 1:29:21.833
I just watched you
introduce yourself

1:29:21.916 --> 1:29:23.375
to your own mother-in-law.

1:29:23.458 --> 1:29:26.708
Man, you have no idea how much evidence
I have to turn your ass in.

1:29:26.791 --> 1:29:28.291
-Pay me.

1:29:36.291 --> 1:29:37.500
Are you okay?

1:29:53.583 --> 1:29:55.833
Hi. Why did you wait up?

1:29:55.916 --> 1:29:57.250
I couldn't get to sleep.

1:30:03.666 --> 1:30:04.833
What did the cops say?

1:30:06.083 --> 1:30:07.250
Um…

1:30:07.333 --> 1:30:09.791
We'll get back to you… blah, blah, blah.

1:30:10.416 --> 1:30:11.500
Oh.

1:30:12.083 --> 1:30:14.708
I can't believe
I have this show tomorrow.

1:30:14.791 --> 1:30:18.125
-Tonight.
-You don't look great, Cass. You okay?

1:30:18.208 --> 1:30:20.541
-No, I'm fine.
-When was the last time you ate?

1:30:20.625 --> 1:30:21.791
Um…

1:30:25.250 --> 1:30:26.291
I don't know.

1:30:28.583 --> 1:30:30.083
-Whoa, whoa. Hey.

1:30:30.166 --> 1:30:32.750
-Yeah.

1:30:32.833 --> 1:30:36.041
We're going to the couch.
Put your weight on me. Yup.

1:30:36.125 --> 1:30:37.958
-Okay.

1:30:38.041 --> 1:30:40.583
All right, let me just-- Okay.
All right, hang on to me.

1:30:40.666 --> 1:30:41.958
Hang on to me.

1:30:42.041 --> 1:30:43.333
Okay.

1:30:44.500 --> 1:30:46.666
-All right. Glucose?
-It's in my purse.

1:30:46.750 --> 1:30:47.791
Purse.

1:30:49.916 --> 1:30:52.000
-Purse, purse.

1:30:52.083 --> 1:30:54.625
-Easy, Peaches.

1:30:57.375 --> 1:30:58.958
Okay. Okay.

1:30:59.041 --> 1:31:01.250
I want you to grab a hold of me.
Grab a hold of me. Yeah.

1:31:01.333 --> 1:31:04.875
Yup, yup, yup, yup.
Okay, come up. All right.

1:31:04.958 --> 1:31:07.750
-Okay. Okay. Open, open.

1:31:08.541 --> 1:31:10.875
There you go. All right.

1:31:11.541 --> 1:31:13.583
-Okay? Enough? All right.
-Mmm. Mmm.

1:31:14.875 --> 1:31:16.833
-Okay.

1:31:19.375 --> 1:31:20.875
How long does it take to work?

1:31:21.750 --> 1:31:25.000
-Like, 20 minutes.
-Twenty minutes. Okay.

1:31:25.083 --> 1:31:26.458
All right.

1:31:26.541 --> 1:31:27.958
Relax, it's gonna be fine.

1:31:28.041 --> 1:31:29.666
-Yeah.

1:31:40.541 --> 1:31:42.458
Your heart is going crazy.

1:31:44.791 --> 1:31:46.708
That's because it's scary, dammit.

1:31:49.750 --> 1:31:50.666
See?

1:31:51.625 --> 1:31:53.125
I'm letting you help me.

1:32:37.375 --> 1:32:38.875
-Ahh!

1:32:38.958 --> 1:32:43.041
If you mess with that woman again,
and you so much as look at my wife,

1:32:43.125 --> 1:32:43.958
I will kill you.

1:32:44.041 --> 1:32:46.583
-Do you understand me?

1:32:46.666 --> 1:32:48.500
-Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

1:33:05.708 --> 1:33:07.625
This is everything I owe you.

1:33:07.708 --> 1:33:08.708
We're done.

1:33:55.416 --> 1:33:57.208
I miss you like hell, man.

1:34:01.041 --> 1:34:02.375
I hope you know that.

1:34:43.333 --> 1:34:44.583
Hey, Frankie…

1:34:45.208 --> 1:34:47.333
…you wanna
hear something crazy?

1:34:51.250 --> 1:34:53.625
I think Cassie Salazar's my best friend.

1:34:56.958 --> 1:34:57.791
I do.

1:35:05.333 --> 1:35:06.583
I love you.

1:35:18.708 --> 1:35:19.708
Hi.

1:35:25.875 --> 1:35:26.791
What's going on?

1:35:28.333 --> 1:35:29.708
I just spoke to my mom.

1:35:29.791 --> 1:35:31.500
Oh. How's she doing?

1:35:34.458 --> 1:35:37.416
She called because she was freaking out.

1:35:37.500 --> 1:35:39.458
She was trying
to get into her car just now,

1:35:39.541 --> 1:35:42.166
and some guy with blood on his shirt

1:35:42.250 --> 1:35:44.666
rolled up, wanting to talk about you.

1:35:46.250 --> 1:35:47.166
Oh.

1:35:47.250 --> 1:35:50.458
About you and me,
and how we're in a fake marriage.

1:35:50.541 --> 1:35:52.250
-Threatening to turn us in.

1:35:52.333 --> 1:35:55.125
She'll understand why though, right?

1:35:57.333 --> 1:35:59.291
Why aren't you asking me who it was?

1:36:00.916 --> 1:36:02.958
Fuck you, Luke. Fuck you!

1:36:03.041 --> 1:36:04.708
-I'm sorry.
-You owe him money?

1:36:04.791 --> 1:36:08.125
This guy said. And that
he sent you a message last night?

1:36:08.208 --> 1:36:10.125
I'm sorry. Okay? I'm so sorry.

1:36:10.208 --> 1:36:12.291
They broke into my mother's house, Luke!

1:36:12.375 --> 1:36:14.875
-I… I am so sorry.
-Did you know?

1:36:16.000 --> 1:36:18.750
You must have, right? That's why
you said you'd pay for the damages.

1:36:18.833 --> 1:36:20.375
-Can you let me explain?
-Yes!

1:36:20.458 --> 1:36:22.041
I'm an addict.

1:36:23.291 --> 1:36:24.375
I'm clean now.

1:36:24.458 --> 1:36:28.375
-Two years sober, okay?
-And what? This guy was your dealer?

1:36:30.708 --> 1:36:32.583
That's why your dad
stopped talking to you.

1:36:32.666 --> 1:36:34.083
Because you were using.

1:36:34.166 --> 1:36:35.708
When my mom died, I, uh…

1:36:37.208 --> 1:36:39.250
I got into her medication just to cope.

1:36:39.833 --> 1:36:42.916
But when I ran out,
Johnno was right there to help me.

1:36:43.000 --> 1:36:46.250
-What does that have anything to do--

1:36:46.333 --> 1:36:49.041
I stole a $50,000 car from my dad.

1:36:49.125 --> 1:36:50.583
A classic Corvette.

1:36:50.666 --> 1:36:53.375
He was rebuilding it
for one of his biggest customers.

1:36:53.458 --> 1:36:54.708
And I broke in.

1:36:55.291 --> 1:36:57.416
I was out of my mind, and…

1:36:59.541 --> 1:37:00.625
I was desperate.

1:37:01.625 --> 1:37:03.708
I was gonna sell it, and instead, I just…

1:37:05.583 --> 1:37:07.666
took it on the freeway, and I totaled it.

1:37:08.250 --> 1:37:10.166
And he said
if I didn't pay that customer back,

1:37:10.250 --> 1:37:11.666
he'd turn me in himself.

1:37:12.250 --> 1:37:13.500
You weren't kidding about him.

1:37:13.583 --> 1:37:16.791
Whatever I didn't have,
I borrowed from Johnno.

1:37:17.666 --> 1:37:19.750
This is why you needed to marry me.

1:37:20.625 --> 1:37:21.583
Yeah.

1:37:23.083 --> 1:37:24.291
Yeah, but look.

1:37:24.375 --> 1:37:25.500
I dealt with him.

1:37:26.083 --> 1:37:28.708
-Okay? I paid him. It's done.

1:37:28.791 --> 1:37:32.166
They could have hurt her,
and she's the only thing that I have.

1:37:32.250 --> 1:37:35.166
-I know, Cassie. I know, I know.
-No. No.

1:37:36.208 --> 1:37:38.583
Don't… Don't just walk away.

1:37:39.166 --> 1:37:40.125
Okay, I'm sorry.

1:37:40.208 --> 1:37:43.416
Not every man you let into your life
is a bad guy that you can't trust.

1:37:43.500 --> 1:37:45.250
Really, Luke? What are you?

1:37:45.333 --> 1:37:47.250
I am someone
who shows up when you need me.

1:37:47.333 --> 1:37:49.375
I don't need you.

1:37:50.541 --> 1:37:51.666
I don't need you.

1:37:52.916 --> 1:37:55.291
Just listen, okay?

1:37:56.041 --> 1:37:57.541
I am so sorry.

1:37:57.625 --> 1:38:00.458
-I messed up.
-Go stay at your dad's or your brother's.

1:38:01.625 --> 1:38:03.291
And tell them that we're getting divorced.

1:38:05.333 --> 1:38:07.041
I'm gonna go to my show tonight,

1:38:07.125 --> 1:38:09.833
but when I come back tomorrow,
I want you gone.

-We played so hard. What did you do?

1:41:39.125 --> 1:41:41.291
I've never seen you play like that
in your life!

1:41:41.375 --> 1:41:45.041
I know a bunch of those people out there.
They're freaking out.

1:41:45.125 --> 1:41:47.458
Marina, promoter from The Hollywood Bowl,
wants you to open

1:41:47.541 --> 1:41:49.333
for Florence and the Machine
in a couple weeks.

1:41:49.416 --> 1:41:50.250
What?

1:41:50.333 --> 1:41:52.083
The Loyal
and Florence and the Machine.

1:41:52.166 --> 1:41:53.750
-What?
-This is massive!

1:41:55.333 --> 1:41:57.166
Hollywood Bowl!

1:42:07.791 --> 1:42:11.291
Lance Corporal Morrow,
I need you to return to base with me.

1:42:12.333 --> 1:42:14.583
I'll give you a few minutes
to grab your gear.

1:42:53.125 --> 1:42:53.958
Hello?

1:42:54.041 --> 1:42:57.500
Luke wants you to know that
he's been charged with fraud and detained.

1:42:57.583 --> 1:43:00.833
They've said you two have a fake marriage
in order to get benefits.

1:43:00.916 --> 1:43:01.916
Is this true?

1:43:02.000 --> 1:43:03.166
Wait, where is Luke?

1:43:03.250 --> 1:43:05.125
I'm headed to base to see him now.

1:43:05.208 --> 1:43:06.833
There's gonna be a trial in a few weeks.

1:43:06.916 --> 1:43:09.875
Then you'll also be hearing from
the police about your role in all this.

1:43:09.958 --> 1:43:11.833
-Was it all an act?
-Uh…

1:43:13.250 --> 1:43:14.208
No.

1:43:14.291 --> 1:43:15.750
Not… Not all of it.

1:43:16.958 --> 1:43:18.916
Even I thought you were good for him.

1:43:21.041 --> 1:43:23.291
I thought you were bringing
my son back to me.

1:44:37.125 --> 1:44:38.125
Hi.

1:44:41.875 --> 1:44:42.916
All rise.

1:44:50.791 --> 1:44:52.541
Good morning. Be seated.

1:44:54.833 --> 1:44:57.125
We're here today for a hearing in the case

1:44:57.208 --> 1:44:59.916
of Lance Corporal Luke A. Morrow.

1:45:00.500 --> 1:45:02.791
Lance Corporal Morrow stands accused

1:45:02.875 --> 1:45:07.666
of entering into a fraudulent marriage
in order to collect BAH

1:45:07.750 --> 1:45:14.291
and FSA pay in violation
of article 132 of the UCMJ.

1:45:14.875 --> 1:45:18.708
We have a signed affidavit
from Jonathan Deluca's testimony

1:45:18.791 --> 1:45:21.041
of the fraudulent marriage.

1:45:21.583 --> 1:45:25.750
Lance Corporal Morrow's wife,
Miss Salazar, is a civilian.

1:45:25.833 --> 1:45:28.583
So, her case will be referred
to state authorities,

1:45:28.666 --> 1:45:32.250
and they may pursue criminal charges.

1:45:33.500 --> 1:45:37.125
They will have access
to the transcripts of these proceedings.

1:45:44.750 --> 1:45:47.500
-I wanna make a statement.
-Lance Corporal, I can't advise that.

1:45:47.583 --> 1:45:50.000
If you don't say anything,
we have a good chance of winning.

1:45:50.083 --> 1:45:51.833
Tell the judge
I'd like to make a statement.

1:45:51.916 --> 1:45:54.708
Lance Corporal Morrow, how do you plead?

1:45:56.250 --> 1:45:59.041
Your Honor,
my client wishes to speak.

1:46:00.041 --> 1:46:01.041
What?

1:46:01.125 --> 1:46:02.458
-Luke.

1:46:05.416 --> 1:46:06.750
You may proceed.

1:46:14.041 --> 1:46:14.916
Sir.

1:46:18.000 --> 1:46:20.250
I coerced Miss Salazar into marrying me.

1:46:21.791 --> 1:46:25.208
Um, she didn't know
that it violated military law.

1:46:25.291 --> 1:46:27.041
-I assured her it didn't.
-No.

1:46:27.625 --> 1:46:29.000
I bear full responsibility,

1:46:29.083 --> 1:46:31.583
and I'm prepared
to face the consequences of my actions.

1:46:37.166 --> 1:46:38.125
Very well.

1:46:39.000 --> 1:46:41.083
-Then I find you guilty.

1:46:45.541 --> 1:46:47.083
Lance Corporal Morrow,

1:46:47.166 --> 1:46:51.000
upon completion of your sentence,
you'll be discharged for bad conduct.

1:46:51.083 --> 1:46:53.208
You will report
for your six-month sentence

1:46:53.291 --> 1:46:55.416
tomorrow at 1700 hours.

1:46:55.500 --> 1:46:58.125
Given the outcome of this trial,
this court will not

1:46:58.208 --> 1:47:00.916
refer Miss Salazar's case
to the local authorities.

1:47:04.791 --> 1:47:06.625
Do you pledge to love this man?

1:47:07.208 --> 1:47:09.250
To be true and loyal to him

1:47:09.333 --> 1:47:11.375
and to comfort and keep him

1:47:11.458 --> 1:47:13.416
in sickness and in health.

1:47:15.208 --> 1:47:16.041
I do.

1:47:16.125 --> 1:47:19.250
By the power vested in me
by the great State of California,

1:47:19.916 --> 1:47:21.750
it is my honor to pronounce you

1:47:22.333 --> 1:47:23.958
husband and wife.

1:47:24.041 --> 1:47:25.416
You may kiss the bride.

1:47:35.041 --> 1:47:37.583
Oh my God,
it is so full out there.

1:47:37.666 --> 1:47:39.625
-Please take your seats.
-Whew.

1:47:42.416 --> 1:47:44.375
Ladies and gentlemen,

1:47:44.458 --> 1:47:49.375
introducing Cassie Salazar and The Loyal.

1:47:49.458 --> 1:47:51.041
-Hi.

1:47:55.500 --> 1:47:57.375
-Right there? Thank you.
-Yeah. Right here.

1:48:02.250 --> 1:48:03.250
Hi, Billy.

1:48:05.291 --> 1:48:07.583
How we doing, Hollywood Bowl?

1:48:07.666 --> 1:48:09.833
Hey, Luke, you ready?

1:48:09.916 --> 1:48:12.083
I'm sorry to say, but it's time.

1:48:17.625 --> 1:48:19.875
I didn't know I'd still get this.

1:48:26.791 --> 1:48:28.708

Thank you.

1:51:53.000 --> 1:51:55.833
That was amazing.
I love you guys. I have to go.

1:51:55.916 --> 1:51:57.208
-See ya.
-Goodbye.

1:52:04.625 --> 1:52:05.458
Thank you.

1:52:11.583 --> 1:52:12.666
Good luck!

1:52:31.583 --> 1:52:33.333
Call Luke Morrow.

1:52:50.541 --> 1:52:52.250
Come on. Pick up, pick up, pick up.

1:52:52.333 --> 1:52:53.958
Pick up, please.

1:52:57.916 --> 1:52:58.958
Just give me a minute.

1:53:06.500 --> 1:53:07.583
We'll see you soon.

1:53:10.916 --> 1:53:12.125
I love you, Brother.

1:53:12.791 --> 1:53:14.291
Damn it, Luke.

1:53:14.375 --> 1:53:16.791
-Now, you be good, huh?

1:53:17.375 --> 1:53:18.375
-You be good.

1:53:18.458 --> 1:53:20.458
Don't you worry.
We'll take good care of her.

1:53:20.541 --> 1:53:21.750
I'm gonna miss you.

1:53:25.208 --> 1:53:26.291
Come here.

1:53:28.000 --> 1:53:29.375
You're gonna be okay.

1:53:29.958 --> 1:53:31.166
I'm proud of you, Son.

1:53:37.875 --> 1:53:39.583
-Love y'all.
-Get out of here.

1:53:43.000 --> 1:53:44.458
Oh. Oh, thank God.

1:53:54.916 --> 1:53:56.083
-Hi.

1:53:59.916 --> 1:54:03.041
-I heard about the record deal, that's--

1:54:03.125 --> 1:54:05.541
-That's really something, Cassie.
-Thank you.

1:54:10.583 --> 1:54:12.791
-We don't have much time, do we?

1:54:13.375 --> 1:54:15.166
No. No, we don't.

1:54:16.250 --> 1:54:17.625
Okay. Um…

1:54:18.708 --> 1:54:21.083
-Then here's what I have to say.

1:54:21.916 --> 1:54:24.875
We vowed to
take care of each other.

1:54:25.833 --> 1:54:29.416
In sickness and in health,
and… and we did that.

1:54:32.458 --> 1:54:34.416
And I think this is a real marriage.

1:54:37.166 --> 1:54:39.291
I think this is
the realest thing I've ever been in.

1:54:39.375 --> 1:54:42.000
-I'm going away for six months.
-I wanna wait for you.

1:54:42.750 --> 1:54:45.166
And I wanna sleep on the floor with you

1:54:45.250 --> 1:54:46.625
when it's storming out.

1:54:48.041 --> 1:54:50.750
And I want you to hear my songs first.

1:54:53.333 --> 1:54:56.166
And I wanna watch you
put on your running shoes,

1:54:56.250 --> 1:54:57.750
go out running,

1:54:57.833 --> 1:55:00.500
and I wanna be the one
that you run back to.

1:55:02.458 --> 1:55:03.916
Because I love you.

1:55:18.125 --> 1:55:20.083
I love you too, Cassie Salazar.

1:55:30.583 --> 1:55:32.708
Whoo!

1:55:58.083 --> 1:56:00.875
You take good care
of this for me, you hear me?

1:56:01.458 --> 1:56:02.833
Because it's real now.

1:56:29.500 --> 1:56:31.083
I love you!

1:56:33.250 --> 1:56:36.333
-Did you hear that? I love you!
