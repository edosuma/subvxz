00:17.184 --> 00:18.784
<i>Clone forces rally!</i>

00:19.664 --> 00:21.743
<i>As the war escalates
in the Outer Rim,</i>

00:21.824 --> 00:24.463
<i>the Jedi knights
are spread thinly across the galaxy.</i>

00:25.423 --> 00:29.262
<i>Many new clones are rushed into service
to support their Jedi generals.</i>

00:29.422 --> 00:32.301
<i>Unfortunately, because of
the relentless demands of battle,</i>

00:32.381 --> 00:34.461
<i>many young clones
must join the struggle</i>

00:34.621 --> 00:37.181
<i>before their intensive training
has been completed.</i>

00:37.301 --> 00:40.220
<i>These clones, manning
a vital network of tracking stations,</i>

00:40.300 --> 00:43.659
<i>are all that stand
between the Republic and invasion.</i>

00:51.658 --> 00:53.898
This is the deck officer checking in.
Nothing going on.

00:54.697 --> 00:55.657
<i>As usual.</i>

00:56.537 --> 00:59.576
<i>You're listening to the grand army
of the Republic broadcast,</i>

00:59.736 --> 01:01.576
<i>the voice of the Outer Rim.</i>

01:01.736 --> 01:05.334
<i>This next one goes out
to the med-jumpers of the 224th.</i>

01:05.495 --> 01:07.175
<i>"Smugging it out on Membom. "</i>

01:07.335 --> 01:10.134
<i>Keep your heads down
and your seals tight, boys.</i>

01:12.854 --> 01:13.574
Yes!

01:14.894 --> 01:16.213
Who's next? Fives?

01:17.013 --> 01:19.093
Shouldn't you be
watching your scope, Hevy?

01:19.172 --> 01:20.373
Let's take a look.

01:21.333 --> 01:23.572
What do you know, all clear.

01:23.732 --> 01:25.812
Just like the last hundred times
I looked at it.

01:26.132 --> 01:28.371
Personally,
I like that it's so quiet out here.

01:28.451 --> 01:29.971
I can catch up on the rig manuals.

01:30.211 --> 01:31.970
Echo, what is wrong with you?

01:32.050 --> 01:34.850
We should be out on the front lines,
blasting droids.

01:35.010 --> 01:37.729
Leave him alone. They kept him
in his girl's chart too long.

01:38.049 --> 01:39.009
Yeah.

01:40.049 --> 01:42.528
You may not realize it yet, Fives,

01:42.928 --> 01:46.047
but you landed on the most boring post
in the Outer Rim.

01:46.447 --> 01:48.048
And one of the most important.

01:50.447 --> 01:52.206
Attention! Sergeant on deck!

01:53.407 --> 01:54.606
At ease!

01:54.766 --> 01:57.325
Even though you're all new here,
I shouldn't have to remind you

01:57.486 --> 01:59.565
that this quadrant is
key to the Outer Rim.

01:59.805 --> 02:03.405
If the droids get past this station,
they can surprise-attack the facilities

02:03.565 --> 02:05.884
where we were born
on our home world of Kamino.

02:06.364 --> 02:07.964
There are some officers on the way,

02:08.122 --> 02:10.523
so I want everything squared away
for inspection.

02:10.842 --> 02:12.522
- Understood?
- Sir, yes, sir!

02:27.397 --> 02:28.836
Still here, Anakin.

02:29.077 --> 02:30.837
When was the last time you slept?

02:30.957 --> 02:33.076
I'll sleep
after we find General Grievous.

02:33.636 --> 02:36.036
Clone intelligence spotted him
in the Balmorra system.

02:36.115 --> 02:37.475
That was weeks ago.

02:37.555 --> 02:38.995
Since then, he vanished.

02:39.155 --> 02:42.674
Well, unlike you, maybe he's
getting some much-needed rest.

02:45.194 --> 02:48.353
Excuse me, General. Incoming
transmission from Commander Cody.

02:49.793 --> 02:51.233
<i>General Kenobi, General Skywalker.</i>

02:51.553 --> 02:53.392
Cody.
How goes the inspections?

02:53.872 --> 02:56.111
<i>The tracking station in Pastil
is fully operational.</i>

02:56.271 --> 02:59.151
<i>Captain Rex and I are proceeding
to the outpost in the Rishi system.</i>

02:59.311 --> 03:01.470
Good.
Report back once you've arrived.

03:01.551 --> 03:02.351
<i>Copy that.</i>

03:02.511 --> 03:03.471
<i>Cody out.</i>

03:04.270 --> 03:06.990
Good man, that Cody.
Don't worry, Anakin.

03:07.070 --> 03:10.909
If General Grievous comes anywhere near
this quadrant, we'll know about it.

03:16.348 --> 03:18.828
- Sir, incoming meteor shower.
- Raise the shield.

03:21.787 --> 03:23.306
You wanted excitement, Hevy.

03:23.387 --> 03:24.347
Right.

03:25.386 --> 03:26.666
Meteor shower.

03:49.811 --> 03:50.852
What the...?

04:07.729 --> 04:10.448
- Get these doors open.
- Roger, roger.

04:14.205 --> 04:15.724
CT-327, report in.

04:15.964 --> 04:18.923
- Sentry, do you copy?
- Interference from the meteors?

04:19.004 --> 04:22.123
- I don't see him down there, Sarge.
- You two, go find him.

04:29.081 --> 04:29.802
Droids!

04:38.920 --> 04:39.840
Sound the alarm!

04:44.199 --> 04:45.999
They've disabled the beacon.

04:47.878 --> 04:50.278
Get a message to the fleet!
We have to warn...

04:53.318 --> 04:54.037
Sarge!

05:02.356 --> 05:03.955
That should slow those buckets down.

05:06.195 --> 05:08.675
- This way. Hurry!
- No, we can...

05:09.394 --> 05:10.753
There's too many.

05:25.521 --> 05:27.534
Four clones escaped, Captain.

05:27.727 --> 05:28.974
They don't matter.

05:29.071 --> 05:33.290
Hard-wire the all-clear signal
and contact General Grievous.

05:39.329 --> 05:41.009
<i>The outpost is secure, General.</i>

05:41.449 --> 05:44.929
<i>We shut down the alarm
and turned on the all-clear signal.</i>

05:45.088 --> 05:46.048
Excellent.

05:46.208 --> 05:47.728
Keep that signal alive.

05:48.208 --> 05:51.727
I don't want the Republic
to find out we're coming.

05:51.888 --> 05:54.607
General, our spy on Kamino
is making contact.

05:55.407 --> 05:57.326
<i>All the preparations
for your invasion</i>

05:57.486 --> 05:58.686
<i>are in order.</i>

05:59.006 --> 05:59.966
Good.

06:00.606 --> 06:02.766
Our fleet is approaching the system.

06:03.006 --> 06:05.725
We are almost
at the rendezvous point.

06:06.125 --> 06:07.484
<i>Very good, my lord.</i>

06:08.205 --> 06:09.724
<i>I will await your arrival.</i>

06:10.204 --> 06:12.204
The destruction of Kamino

06:12.284 --> 06:16.043
will stop their production of clones
for good.

06:20.682 --> 06:23.322
Rishi outpost, this is Commander Cody.
Do you copy?

06:23.882 --> 06:25.561
<i>Rishi outpost, please respond.</i>

06:26.841 --> 06:28.600
Open...
Open...

06:28.761 --> 06:30.520
Open comlink channel.

06:31.320 --> 06:32.440
Rishi outpost, come in.

06:32.920 --> 06:34.520
Rishi outpost, come in.

06:34.759 --> 06:35.959
<i>Sorry, Commander.</i>

06:36.119 --> 06:39.398
<i>We're experiencing
technical difficulties.</i>

06:39.879 --> 06:41.318
This is the inspection team.

06:41.559 --> 06:43.797
<i>Inspection?
Negative, negative.</i>

06:43.958 --> 06:46.437
<i>We do not require an inspection.</i>

06:46.597 --> 06:48.436
<i>Everything is fine here.
Thank you.</i>

06:48.917 --> 06:51.636
We'll be the judge of that.
Prepare for our arrival.

06:52.196 --> 06:53.316
<i>Roger, roger.</i>

06:54.516 --> 06:56.356
Something's not right here.

06:57.155 --> 06:59.795
Well, good luck.
I'm putting you in charge of this one.

07:22.350 --> 07:24.270
What do we do without the sarge?

07:24.351 --> 07:26.830
- The reg manual says the next...
- Wait. Wait.

07:27.310 --> 07:30.109
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah, what is that?

07:30.349 --> 07:32.188
It doesn't sound like droids.

07:35.308 --> 07:37.468
Don't forget about those giant eels.

07:37.868 --> 07:39.148
I've never seen...

07:40.747 --> 07:41.707
Cutup!

07:46.666 --> 07:48.265
What the hell was that?!

07:48.505 --> 07:49.706
That was an eel.

07:49.866 --> 07:52.425
Now, that's why we have the regulation
not to go outside.

07:52.585 --> 07:54.584
Let's move before it comes back.

07:54.744 --> 07:55.864
Poor Cutup.

07:58.344 --> 08:00.104
Look! It's Commander Cody.

08:00.183 --> 08:01.943
It's the inspection team.

08:13.781 --> 08:16.980
This is not good.
I don't see the deck officer anywhere.

08:18.180 --> 08:19.620
These boys are sloppy.

08:19.779 --> 08:22.259
There should always be
an officer on duty.

08:23.219 --> 08:25.779
We have to warn them.
Get on the comlink.

08:29.618 --> 08:31.938
I have a bad feeling about this.

08:32.256 --> 08:34.017
Welcome to Rishi, Commander.

08:34.177 --> 08:37.535
As you can see, the outpost is
operating at peak efficiency.

08:38.417 --> 08:40.976
Thank you for visiting,
and have a safe trip back.

08:43.056 --> 08:45.135
We need to inspect the base
just the same.

08:46.254 --> 08:47.614
There is no need.

08:47.774 --> 08:50.094
Everything is fine
and fully operational.

08:55.134 --> 08:57.853
It's no good. Their comlinks
are on a different scramble set.

08:57.932 --> 08:59.612
I'll signal them with this flare.

08:59.772 --> 09:01.612
Take us to the sergeant in command.

09:02.172 --> 09:03.291
Roger, roger.

09:06.051 --> 09:07.531
A droid attack flare?

09:08.971 --> 09:10.730
Rex!
What the heck are you doing?

09:11.850 --> 09:12.770
Relax.

09:14.570 --> 09:15.889
Just as I thought.

09:16.169 --> 09:18.328
Looks like one of those
new commando droids.

09:18.409 --> 09:20.728
That flare must have come
from the survivors.

09:22.488 --> 09:23.448
Ambush!

09:32.997 --> 09:34.997
Those clankers have tough armor.

09:42.265 --> 09:43.426
We're cut off.

09:47.425 --> 09:48.672
Off the platform!

09:50.144 --> 09:51.144
Copy that.

10:02.422 --> 10:05.422
No sign of them.
They must have been pulverized.

10:06.061 --> 10:07.821
Resume defensive posts.

10:19.018 --> 10:21.818
Well, that sure complicates things,
Commander.

10:21.898 --> 10:25.258
- No worse than that time on Tibrin.
- We had Jedi with us on Tibrin.

10:25.418 --> 10:26.418
They helped.

10:29.977 --> 10:32.857
Hands above your heads.
Take your sun bonnets off.

10:33.257 --> 10:35.176
- Sir?
- Take 'em off! Now!

10:49.413 --> 10:50.373
Nice shot.

10:50.773 --> 10:51.812
The name's Rex.

10:52.772 --> 10:54.933
But you'll call me "Captain",
or "sir".

10:55.332 --> 10:56.532
Sir, yes, sir!

10:57.332 --> 10:59.491
I'm Commander Cody, your new boss.

11:00.131 --> 11:02.930
My designation is trooper 27-5555, sir.

11:03.251 --> 11:05.170
We call him Fives.
I'm Hevy.

11:05.491 --> 11:06.610
This is Echo.

11:07.010 --> 11:08.370
Where's your sergeant?

11:08.529 --> 11:10.690
Dead, sir.
We're all that's left.

11:11.009 --> 11:13.809
Looks like we got ourselves
a batch of shinies, Commander.

11:14.568 --> 11:16.609
- Shinies, sir?
- That's right.

11:17.088 --> 11:19.087
Your armor, it's shiny and new...

11:19.407 --> 11:20.527
just like you.

11:21.647 --> 11:22.527
Sir,

11:22.687 --> 11:25.006
me and my batchers
are trained and ready.

11:25.087 --> 11:27.486
We'll take back our post,
shiny or not.

11:28.046 --> 11:29.726
There's hope for you yet, rookie.

11:33.949 --> 11:35.789
Commander Cody, do you copy?

11:36.748 --> 11:38.428
Captain Rex, please respond.

11:38.828 --> 11:41.708
They should have checked in
from the Rishi station hours ago.

11:41.868 --> 11:44.507
It appears your captain follows orders
as well as you do.

11:45.162 --> 11:48.682
Perhaps Cody is boring Rex
with standard procedures and protocol.

11:49.082 --> 11:51.721
We need to work on our own
boring procedures

11:51.881 --> 11:54.201
and figure out a strategy
to find Grievous.

11:54.841 --> 11:57.800
Right. Admiral, let me know
if you hear from Rex.

12:04.519 --> 12:05.799
Look sharp, rookies.

12:05.879 --> 12:07.958
As long as those tweezers
occupy this post,

12:08.119 --> 12:10.358
our home planet of Kamino
is at risk.

12:10.598 --> 12:13.638
- But there's so many of them.
- Doesn't matter, kid.

12:13.717 --> 12:17.236
We have to retake this base,
so we will retake this base.

12:19.557 --> 12:23.076
How do you propose we get through
those blast doors, Rex, old boy?

12:23.155 --> 12:24.995
I have a few ideas.

12:28.514 --> 12:29.634
What is that?

12:33.794 --> 12:35.953
Unit 2-6, is that you?

12:38.512 --> 12:39.553
<i>Roger, roger.</i>

12:40.032 --> 12:41.392
You sound strange.

12:41.712 --> 12:43.632
Is something wrong
with your vocabulator?

12:44.912 --> 12:47.071
- Roger, roger.
- Take off your helmet.

12:47.151 --> 12:48.751
Let me see your faceplate.

12:49.470 --> 12:50.671
<i>Roger, roger.</i>

12:54.590 --> 12:56.270
This is never gonna work.

13:00.109 --> 13:01.868
- Clones!
- Roger, roger.

13:04.508 --> 13:05.787
Right. Let's move.

13:10.615 --> 13:13.894
- Permission to take point, sir?
- I'm always first, kid.

13:24.165 --> 13:26.213
- Fives!
- He's okay. Focus on the battle.

13:37.250 --> 13:38.131
I got one!

13:38.291 --> 13:41.489
- Sorry, Echo. I jumped that one.
- Like hell you did.

13:45.134 --> 13:48.011
Not so tough now,
are ya, Sparky?

13:50.044 --> 13:51.164
Get to the window.

13:51.244 --> 13:53.484
It looks like we have
more visitors.

13:58.762 --> 14:00.842
It looks like a Separatist fleet.

14:03.482 --> 14:05.481
That's why they commandeered
the outpost.

14:05.562 --> 14:07.481
They're mounting
a full-scale invasion.

14:07.561 --> 14:09.241
We have to warn command.

14:10.840 --> 14:13.880
The Republic base is still transmitting
the all-clear signal,

14:13.959 --> 14:17.079
but for some reason, our commando
droids are not responding.

14:17.080 --> 14:19.382
We can leave nothing to chance.

14:19.508 --> 14:23.268
That base cannot be allowed
to alert the Jedi that we're coming.

14:23.987 --> 14:26.547
Send down reinforcements
to investigate.

14:28.467 --> 14:30.306
Those clankers sabotaged
our transmitter,

14:30.387 --> 14:32.946
and they hard-wired the all-clear signal.
It'll take time to repair.

14:33.106 --> 14:34.945
- We don't have time.
- Look.

14:40.624 --> 14:44.224
Well, buddy, you always said
you wanted to be on the front lines.

15:03.420 --> 15:06.219
We can't protect the outpost long
against that army of clankers.

15:06.620 --> 15:09.299
Then we'll destroy the outpost instead.

15:09.939 --> 15:13.538
But, sir, our mission is to defend
this facility at all costs.

15:13.698 --> 15:16.058
We have to warn the Republic
about the invasion.

15:16.178 --> 15:18.417
They'll take notice
when the all-clear signal stops.

15:18.857 --> 15:19.857
That's right.

15:19.937 --> 15:22.097
When they stop receiving our beacon,

15:22.217 --> 15:24.096
they'll get the message
something's wrong.

15:24.216 --> 15:26.456
We'll need every thermal detonator
in the inventory.

15:26.535 --> 15:29.575
It'll take more than a few detonators
to destroy this outpost.

15:29.695 --> 15:31.055
We can use the LT.

15:31.174 --> 15:33.374
This moon freezes
for over half the year.

15:33.414 --> 15:35.894
We use liquid tibanna as fuel
to heat the base.

15:36.054 --> 15:39.173
- Liquid tibanna... highly explosive.
- Good.

15:39.573 --> 15:42.053
Bring the tanks here
and prime the detonators.

15:50.531 --> 15:51.651
All right, listen up.

15:51.811 --> 15:55.090
There's only one target of interest
in this sector: Kamino.

15:55.250 --> 15:57.330
It's the closest thing
we clones have to a home.

15:57.490 --> 15:59.329
Today we fight
for more than the Republic.

15:59.410 --> 16:01.809
Today we fight for all our brothers
back home.

16:01.969 --> 16:03.808
- Understood?
- Sir, yes, sir!

16:11.487 --> 16:13.807
I think we can even the odds a bit,
Commander,

16:13.966 --> 16:16.046
especially since they don't know
we're here.

16:16.206 --> 16:17.647
This one here is mine.

16:18.606 --> 16:20.606
Big gun doesn't make a big man.

16:26.285 --> 16:28.044
- Reinforcements reporting.
- Open up.

16:31.484 --> 16:33.083
Didn't say "please. "

16:35.243 --> 16:36.602
Clones! Get 'em!

16:45.481 --> 16:47.401
We could use a Jedi about now.

16:51.880 --> 16:53.160
Captain Rex, come in.

16:53.239 --> 16:55.159
Commander Cody, are you there?

16:56.279 --> 16:58.039
General, there's still no response.

16:58.599 --> 17:01.878
How about the all-clear signal?
Is the base still transmitting?

17:01.957 --> 17:02.838
Yes, sir.

17:02.917 --> 17:05.317
If something were wrong,
Cody would contact us.

17:05.477 --> 17:07.077
What is the status of the base?

17:08.276 --> 17:10.195
We've run into some difficulties.

17:10.277 --> 17:12.596
There seem to be
a few clones left, sir.

17:12.675 --> 17:14.116
Then wipe them out.

17:14.276 --> 17:17.234
We can't let a few puny clones
stop us.

17:24.287 --> 17:26.207
Fall back to the op center.
Move!

17:31.645 --> 17:34.124
<i>- Rex, time's wasting.
- Almost ready.</i>

17:36.363 --> 17:39.163
The handset isn't linking up
with the detonator.

17:40.256 --> 17:41.655
- Hevy.
- Yes, sir.

17:41.815 --> 17:43.895
- This detonator isn't working.
- I'll take care of it.

17:43.959 --> 17:46.119
It'll be fixed in no time.
You guys get out of here.

17:46.199 --> 17:49.158
Just make it fast.
Those droids are getting close.

17:55.237 --> 17:57.476
There.
That should fix it.

18:02.276 --> 18:03.515
This isn't good.

18:04.036 --> 18:05.956
There's got to be another way.

18:20.320 --> 18:22.000
The base is ours again, sir.

18:22.159 --> 18:24.079
- The clones are fleeing.
- Cowards.

18:24.200 --> 18:25.119
Secure the area.

18:31.103 --> 18:32.462
Hevy, hit the...

18:32.542 --> 18:34.462
<i>- Where's Hevy?
- I'm on it, sir.</i>

18:35.022 --> 18:36.781
Hevy, get out of there.

18:36.941 --> 18:39.500
The remote isn't working.
I have to detonate it manually.

18:39.821 --> 18:41.900
Hold on there.
Blast him!

18:43.340 --> 18:45.419
We've got to get up there.
Back to the maintenance pipe.

18:45.500 --> 18:48.059
- Let's move.
- It's no use. I know what I have to do.

18:49.819 --> 18:51.898
I don't like your tone, rookie.

18:57.258 --> 18:58.377
<i>Soldier, come in.</i>

18:58.537 --> 18:59.657
<i>Are you there?</i>

19:06.456 --> 19:09.399
<i>Soldier, come in!
Respond!</i>

19:09.783 --> 19:11.030
<i>Talk to us!</i>

19:26.929 --> 19:29.026
Hevy, come in.
Come in, Hevy!

19:29.794 --> 19:30.944
<i>Hevy, come in!</i>

19:33.105 --> 19:34.945
Do we take prisoners?

19:35.744 --> 19:36.784
I don't.

19:52.789 --> 19:55.212
Hevy always did hate that place.

19:59.100 --> 20:00.939
The all-clear signal
has been disabled?

20:01.099 --> 20:02.779
The Rishi base has
stopped transmitting.

20:03.124 --> 20:05.403
- Grievous.
- Sound the invasion alarm.

20:05.563 --> 20:07.402
Let's get the fleet under way.

20:09.882 --> 20:12.361
I didn't tell them
to blow up the station.

20:12.729 --> 20:14.920
But isn't it good
that the base is destroyed?

20:15.001 --> 20:15.961
Idiot!

20:17.481 --> 20:19.000
The Republic fleet.

20:19.120 --> 20:21.360
We're outgunned.
Get us out of here.

20:31.718 --> 20:33.558
We've got those tinnies on the run.

20:33.637 --> 20:34.877
Thanks to Hevy.

20:35.141 --> 20:36.181
Gunships.

20:36.470 --> 20:38.004
Getting off this crater, boys.

20:54.964 --> 20:56.484
On behalf of the Republic,

20:56.499 --> 20:58.698
we thank you
for your valiant service,

20:58.858 --> 21:01.258
and we honor
your comrade's sacrifice.

21:02.537 --> 21:04.737
Your new unit is lucky to have you.

21:05.497 --> 21:08.296
I'd be proud to fight
beside you anytime, anywhere.

21:12.736 --> 21:14.055
Congratulations.

21:14.295 --> 21:16.055
You're not shinies anymore.

21:17.615 --> 21:20.214
With all due respect, sir,
we failed our mission.

21:20.374 --> 21:22.014
We don't deserve this honor.

21:22.134 --> 21:25.413
No. If it weren't for you,
the Republic wouldn't have learned

21:25.493 --> 21:28.133
of the Separatists' invasion
until it was too late.

21:28.253 --> 21:29.972
You showed me something today.

21:30.252 --> 21:33.371
You're exactly the kind of men
I need in the 501st.

21:34.012 --> 21:35.331
Sir, yes, sir!
