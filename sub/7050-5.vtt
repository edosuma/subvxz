WEBVTT

00:02.086 --> 00:03.544
Previously on Justified...

00:03.629 --> 00:05.922
Arlo didn't say anything
about the ID or the bag?

00:06.006 --> 00:08.132
Just got him to admit
he knew it was hidden in the wall.

00:08.258 --> 00:09.634
Why would your father do that?

00:09.760 --> 00:12.136
You could ask him.
I get the feeling he ain't gonna say much.

00:12.262 --> 00:15.848
Drew Thompson was wanted
in a sealed federal witness warrant.

00:15.933 --> 00:17.308
- What'd he witness?
- Well, I don't know.

00:17.434 --> 00:18.768
That's what "sealed" means.

00:18.852 --> 00:23.356
Drew saw Theo Tonin
murder a government informant.

00:23.440 --> 00:25.608
We've got to assume
Barnes told Theo everything we know.

00:25.693 --> 00:27.318
He's gonna send an army after Drew.

00:27.444 --> 00:29.028
I'm not looking for a partner.

00:29.113 --> 00:30.488
I was the heir apparent.

00:30.614 --> 00:33.950
Boyd has never been
nothing but a thorn in his daddy's fat ass.

00:34.034 --> 00:35.868
What if I were to help you kill him?

00:36.036 --> 00:38.079
Shit. Look what the cat drug in.

00:38.163 --> 00:40.206
Ellen May. What are you doing here?

00:40.290 --> 00:41.874
It'll be quick, Ava.

00:42.668 --> 00:45.336
One minute, she's here,
and the next, she's gone.

00:45.504 --> 00:48.506
- I got to take a piss. You pump, I'll pay.
- Okay.

00:53.971 --> 00:55.304
Oh, shit.

00:56.140 --> 00:57.724
Shit! Shit!

00:58.809 --> 00:59.851
Shit!

01:01.019 --> 01:02.520
Oh, Ellen May.

01:08.569 --> 01:10.027
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:10.154 --> 01:12.447
I noticed you have some
security cameras outside.

01:12.531 --> 01:13.573
I guess.

01:13.657 --> 01:16.284
Well, I was here with a young lady,
and I went to take a leak.

01:16.368 --> 01:18.870
I went back to the truck, and she was gone.

01:18.996 --> 01:20.913
So I'd like to look at that video
and see where she went.

01:21.331 --> 01:23.374
Oh, I'm not allowed to
let anybody back there.

01:24.501 --> 01:25.585
Come on, man.

01:25.669 --> 01:27.503
No. No exceptions.

01:29.506 --> 01:31.174
You don't need to do that.

01:33.927 --> 01:37.013
Come on.
Get your hand out from under there.

01:38.682 --> 01:40.683
No, sir. I don't think so.

01:43.520 --> 01:44.729
I want to show you something.

01:45.355 --> 01:47.398
- Hey, I got a gun here.
- Hey, hey, relax.

01:47.608 --> 01:49.025
Relax.

01:57.534 --> 01:59.243
I'm military police.

02:03.040 --> 02:04.373
All right?

02:05.709 --> 02:07.585
I shouldn't be telling you this.

02:07.711 --> 02:10.295
But that girl, she ran out
before her hitch was up,

02:10.380 --> 02:13.090
and I am just trying
to get her back to Fort Knox.

02:15.886 --> 02:17.220
Can you help me out?

02:19.556 --> 02:21.224
Yeah, yeah, okay.

02:31.443 --> 02:33.611
Girl, where'd you go to?

02:34.112 --> 02:35.696
Is there another camera?

02:35.781 --> 02:37.740
Just the one works.

02:41.453 --> 02:42.954
Wait. Hold up.

02:59.304 --> 03:00.471
You're here!

03:00.597 --> 03:03.266
Yeah, I've been here, 15 minutes.

03:03.475 --> 03:06.227
Oh, well, I don't know.
You weren't here for the last two, so...

03:06.311 --> 03:09.063
Brought you some coffee.
Might be a little cold.

03:09.147 --> 03:10.481
Decaf?

03:15.779 --> 03:18.197
- You look fantastic.
- Thank you. Thanks. I feel good.

03:18.282 --> 03:19.365
Yeah, you look great.

03:19.449 --> 03:21.534
Thank you. Now that
I'm not throwing up all the time,

03:21.618 --> 03:24.745
I even managed to pick up some work doing
freelance depositions and stuff.

03:24.830 --> 03:25.955
You don't have to do that.

03:26.790 --> 03:29.125
I've been making extra money
doing some side jobs.

03:29.543 --> 03:30.960
Okay.

03:31.044 --> 03:33.004
Art's okay with you doing side jobs now?

03:33.130 --> 03:34.338
I'll tell you what Art's done.

03:34.464 --> 03:38.217
He's put me in charge of what could be
the biggest case in our office's history.

03:38.343 --> 03:39.844
You gonna tell me the particulars?

03:39.970 --> 03:42.054
Well, can't really talk about that.

03:42.139 --> 03:45.725
But I'm serious,
it could be a real game-changer.

03:46.977 --> 03:48.436
- What?
- The baby's kicking.

03:48.520 --> 03:49.854
You want to feel it?

03:51.648 --> 03:54.483
- Yeah. Here?
- No, down here.

03:58.906 --> 04:01.032
- Does that hurt?
- No.

04:05.370 --> 04:07.872
Hey, little one. You got to lose the tail.

04:07.998 --> 04:09.749
Come out and read about
your daddy in the paper.

04:10.834 --> 04:12.251
Yeah? What section?

04:15.547 --> 04:18.673
- The job is still the job, you know.
- Yeah.

04:19.343 --> 04:22.386
Well, this baby lost its tail a little while ago,
just so you know.

04:24.556 --> 04:26.515
Well, I'm a little behind on my homework.

04:26.600 --> 04:29.268
But the point is,
I'm gonna be here for you and the baby.

04:31.063 --> 04:32.396
That's really great.

04:33.231 --> 04:35.107
You know, when you didn't respond
to my text

04:35.192 --> 04:37.526
telling you that the appointment
had changed, I thought

04:37.611 --> 04:39.862
you just weren't gonna show up again.

04:41.031 --> 04:43.074
When did you change it?

04:43.200 --> 04:45.242
You didn't get my text.

04:46.411 --> 04:48.245
So, if you didn't get my text, you're not...

04:48.580 --> 04:51.999
You're not early.
You are about a half-hour late.

04:52.084 --> 04:54.710
Shit. I got to call the office.

04:56.046 --> 04:57.964
- Hey, Raylan?
- Yeah?

04:58.423 --> 05:00.257
You're not staying
for the appointment, are you?

05:01.259 --> 05:03.386
- This is Raylan.
- How quickly can you be here?

05:03.470 --> 05:06.263
- For what?
- Rachel. Come on.

05:06.390 --> 05:08.724
Just get here, now.

05:54.479 --> 05:55.896
Files over here.

05:55.981 --> 05:58.482
They can go right over in here. Thank you.

06:00.318 --> 06:02.236
- Vasquez.
- Agent Barkley.

06:02.320 --> 06:05.072
What in the hell is going on?
Why do you have all my case files?

06:05.157 --> 06:07.783
Well, it's simple, really. We petitioned DOJ

06:07.868 --> 06:10.494
- to turn the Drew Thompson case over to us.
- On what grounds?

06:10.620 --> 06:13.122
Your guy as much as admitted
he worked for the Detroit outfit

06:13.206 --> 06:14.915
just before he blew his brains out.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.419
We were on to Agent Barnes.
I had opened up an investigation on him.

06:18.503 --> 06:20.254
The suicide taints the case.

06:20.338 --> 06:23.966
Look, Barkley, it's done.
The Marshals are running it.

06:24.801 --> 06:26.886
...turn over my life work so the Marshals...

06:26.970 --> 06:29.555
Looks like we've got them all spun up.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.141
They want this so bad, they can taste it.

06:33.685 --> 06:36.520
But if you were to be
incapacitated for some reason,

06:36.646 --> 06:39.273
they might use it
as a pretext to nullify the deal.

06:39.357 --> 06:42.485
So it would be in your best interest
to tell me the name, as well.

06:42.694 --> 06:46.197
I hope you understand
this isn't just some fugitive hunt, Chief.

06:46.740 --> 06:50.951
This is a major criminal investigation that
has been going on for decades!

06:51.036 --> 06:53.329
We'll appreciate any help you can provide.

06:53.413 --> 06:58.167
Well, it's all in the case files.
Anything you need from me, get a subpoena.

07:01.838 --> 07:03.047
Givens.

07:05.175 --> 07:08.219
My guess is, you're the one
who's behind all this, huh?

07:08.345 --> 07:09.428
What the hell are you talking about?

07:09.513 --> 07:12.807
I'm talking about payback
from when I was coming after you.

07:12.891 --> 07:14.225
And I still think you're dirty.

07:15.018 --> 07:16.393
Kiss my ass.

07:17.854 --> 07:19.605
- Agent Barkley.
- What?

07:19.898 --> 07:21.732
A receipt for your files.

07:26.029 --> 07:28.697
- What the hell is going on?
- Well, not much.

07:28.782 --> 07:30.908
Barkley's pissed off
we took his case away from him.

07:31.034 --> 07:32.576
Not with him, with him.

07:34.913 --> 07:36.747
You want to tell him, or should I?

07:37.791 --> 07:39.375
You're not gonna like this.

07:42.295 --> 07:45.923
Mr Vasquez, here, brought your dad in
to make a deal with him.

07:46.216 --> 07:47.800
What's he want, free cable?

07:48.385 --> 07:50.302
He's gonna hand over Drew Thompson.

07:51.054 --> 07:53.889
And in return, we're gonna let him walk.

07:57.936 --> 08:02.648
If Drew Thompson is alive,
and your daddy insists that he is,

08:02.732 --> 08:05.526
then his testimony
could bring down Theo Tonin.

08:05.610 --> 08:08.654
Yeah, and if we got a shot
at Theo Tonin, we got to take it, right?

08:22.919 --> 08:24.461
It makes sense.

08:27.591 --> 08:29.633
Fact that he killed a cop,

08:30.343 --> 08:32.595
it's upsetting and all, but,

08:33.471 --> 08:34.972
yeah, I get it.

08:35.265 --> 08:36.890
Well, we don't have a lot of time

08:36.975 --> 08:39.143
to wait and see if Barnes
is the only bad apple,

08:39.269 --> 08:41.270
so we got to get
to Drew Thompson before Detroit does.

08:42.147 --> 08:43.480
How much time I got?

08:43.815 --> 08:45.399
What do you mean, how much time you got?

08:45.483 --> 08:48.777
To find Drew Thompson
and make sure my daddy dies in prison.

08:48.862 --> 08:50.487
Well, once we have a deal,

08:50.614 --> 08:53.532
we still need written approval
from Washington, so,

08:53.617 --> 08:54.825
that will give you 24 hours.

08:57.162 --> 08:58.412
Where you goin'?

08:58.496 --> 09:00.247
Well, I figured
I'd go back to where it started,

09:00.332 --> 09:01.832
Harlan County.

09:10.675 --> 09:12.009
Any cats?

09:14.679 --> 09:16.472
Do you see any cats?

09:17.891 --> 09:19.058
No.

09:20.977 --> 09:22.186
We're clear.

09:23.813 --> 09:26.106
Welcome to Kentucky, Mr Tonin.

09:26.191 --> 09:28.192
That's not Mr Tonin.

09:29.569 --> 09:30.945
What's up, man? Hey!

09:31.029 --> 09:32.988
- Oh, come on!
- What is that?

09:33.073 --> 09:34.323
Get that!

09:35.533 --> 09:36.742
Nick Augustine.

09:37.244 --> 09:38.661
Wynn Duffy.

09:39.329 --> 09:41.163
You can stay. Your guys got to wait outside.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.760
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you again.

09:54.844 --> 09:56.971
Yeah, he tell you
we grew up together in the projects?

09:57.055 --> 09:58.847
- No.
- Yeah, long time ago.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.349
- Long time.
- Yeah, he went to law school.

10:00.433 --> 10:01.976
I went to work for the Tonins.

10:02.060 --> 10:03.811
Found myself in a little situation.

10:03.895 --> 10:05.688
Yeah, he walks into a setup.

10:05.772 --> 10:07.147
I hear "FBI. Nobody move."

10:07.232 --> 10:09.149
Yeah, so the genius, he takes off running.

10:09.234 --> 10:11.485
I run out the building.
I go into another building.

10:11.569 --> 10:12.820
I'm looking for somewhere to hide.

10:12.904 --> 10:15.614
I find the bathroom.
I'm hiding on the toilet, and I hear footsteps.

10:15.699 --> 10:16.949
Bam! I come in.

10:17.033 --> 10:19.076
I say, "Hey, man, get off of the shitter.
It's just me."

10:19.202 --> 10:20.411
I've never been so relieved in my life.

10:20.537 --> 10:22.538
And I've been protecting you ever since.

10:22.872 --> 10:25.708
Even so, Drew Thompson's alive.

10:26.626 --> 10:27.876
How'd you miss that, buddy?

10:28.712 --> 10:32.715
No, Nicky, Nicky, you got to know,
everybody missed that.

10:32.966 --> 10:36.385
I mean DEA, state police,
local police, all missed it.

10:37.262 --> 10:39.555
Point is, Theo, is he upset?

10:40.807 --> 10:43.225
Theo's talking to the ear. You tell me.

10:44.311 --> 10:48.314
Bottom line,
I don't think any of this is gonna pan out.

10:48.398 --> 10:51.108
I mean, the old man, Arlo Givens, is crazy.

10:51.234 --> 10:53.569
Okay, but if it does pan out,
you got it handled?

10:53.653 --> 10:55.029
It's handled.

10:55.113 --> 10:57.614
I mean, we get a name,
I am the first one in that door,

10:57.741 --> 10:59.116
and bam, it's done.

10:59.242 --> 11:02.578
I'll just say he reached for a weapon.
Problem solved.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.538
Theo wants him alive.

11:04.622 --> 11:06.874
No, no, Nicky, no.

11:06.958 --> 11:08.542
That's not the way it works.

11:08.626 --> 11:10.127
How's it work?

11:11.296 --> 11:14.298
Once he is in custody, that's it.

11:14.424 --> 11:17.801
I mean, it's not like I could be checking him
out like a book at the library.

11:17.927 --> 11:22.806
Drew Thompson shot Theo in the eye
and left him for dead on a runway in Panama.

11:22.932 --> 11:25.434
He stole $2 million worth
of cocaine from the outfit.

11:25.769 --> 11:29.438
Losing that cocaine put Theo in a jam
with some very nasty people.

11:29.522 --> 11:33.108
But you know what really hurt?
Getting shot in the eye.

11:33.485 --> 11:34.693
He wants him alive.

11:34.778 --> 11:36.987
I don't mean to intrude,

11:37.697 --> 11:40.240
but I know the Crowders. I know Arlo Givens.

11:40.325 --> 11:42.159
If there's anything I can do...

11:42.285 --> 11:44.870
As a matter of fact, Wynn,
that's what Theo wanted me to...

11:44.954 --> 11:47.831
Hey, hey, hey, wait...
Wait a minute. I can handle this.

11:48.958 --> 11:51.168
- Jerry, are you sure?
- I'm sure.

11:52.295 --> 11:53.545
Just gonna be expensive.

11:53.630 --> 11:55.464
All right. How expensive?

11:56.800 --> 11:58.300
Two hundred fifty.

12:00.512 --> 12:01.970
Jerry, really?

12:03.306 --> 12:04.932
Is that really the price?

12:05.016 --> 12:07.309
Or are you just thinking
about taking off with the money?

12:08.853 --> 12:09.978
Jesus, Nicky.

12:10.063 --> 12:11.772
What the hell kind of a question is that?

12:11.856 --> 12:12.898
Fair.

12:12.982 --> 12:15.984
I mean, I've always been protecting you.
I mean, we're friends.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.319
We are.

12:18.905 --> 12:23.075
But I heard the FBI doesn't even have the
case any more. The Marshals are running it.

12:23.159 --> 12:24.785
Where you hear that?

12:24.869 --> 12:27.871
Do you really think that you're the only guy
Theo's got left in the FBI?

12:33.670 --> 12:35.921
Mr Tonin would like you
to find Drew Thompson.

12:37.215 --> 12:38.715
Not a problem.

12:44.556 --> 12:47.141
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I'm Colton Rhodes.

12:47.225 --> 12:49.601
- I work for Boyd Crowder.
- I know.

12:50.395 --> 12:52.938
One of your deputies
picked up a girl last night.

12:53.022 --> 12:55.732
Name's Ellen May.
She works for Ava Crowder.

12:56.401 --> 12:58.402
Let me check the blotter.

13:08.621 --> 13:11.290
I've got a drunk-and-disorderly and...

13:11.374 --> 13:14.209
Kid on meth tried to stick up
a hardware store.

13:14.294 --> 13:16.587
- That's it.
- No.

13:17.422 --> 13:19.339
- One of your boys took her.
- You sure about that?

13:19.424 --> 13:20.924
Yeah, I'm sure about that.

13:21.050 --> 13:23.051
He picked her up at the Reliable gas station.

13:26.723 --> 13:28.724
No, I got nothing on that.

13:30.059 --> 13:31.852
All right, look, man,

13:31.936 --> 13:35.147
I just thought you might appreciate me
giving you the heads-up. That's all.

13:35.231 --> 13:37.316
You know, he's got me
out there looking for her.

13:37.400 --> 13:39.443
Well, if I find anything out,

13:39.569 --> 13:42.154
should I call you at the bar? Or Audrey's?

13:42.238 --> 13:45.574
Well, not unless you want Boyd knowing
how bad your guys screwed this up.

13:49.078 --> 13:50.537
I'll call you.

13:50.622 --> 13:52.122
Whatever you say.

13:52.415 --> 13:53.916
Line me up!

13:54.000 --> 13:56.126
- We open yet?
- Just about.

13:56.252 --> 13:57.920
Well, if there ain't a line
around the block, don't.

13:58.004 --> 14:02.299
We got a visitor coming by.
A man from Frankfort gonna be here in five.

14:03.426 --> 14:05.177
- Wynn Duffy?
- The same.

14:05.637 --> 14:08.680
- What the hell's he want?
- Well, I know what I want him to want.

14:10.433 --> 14:13.769
Dixie Mafia just shows up like that
out of the blue,

14:13.853 --> 14:15.437
maybe he's not coming here to talk.

14:15.522 --> 14:16.897
Well, in that eventuality,

14:16.981 --> 14:19.316
make sure that
sawed-off behind the bar is close at hand.

14:20.860 --> 14:23.445
- You got my back, cousin Johnny.
- Always.

14:24.489 --> 14:26.615
Wynn Duffy! Come on in.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.868
Hey. This a holiday?

14:31.621 --> 14:34.122
Well, not the man I was
looking for, but it'll do.

14:34.832 --> 14:36.959
I want you to have a seat.

14:38.461 --> 14:39.920
Where the hell you been all night?

14:40.004 --> 14:42.673
Sorry. I had my phone off. I had to sleep.

14:43.508 --> 14:45.467
I feel like I'm catching something.

14:45.969 --> 14:49.137
Well, I'll ask about your cold once you tell
me how it went with Ellen May.

14:51.307 --> 14:52.891
- It's done.
- Where'd you do it?

14:53.977 --> 14:56.645
In the woods, about a half-mile off the main.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.147
What time?

14:59.649 --> 15:02.359
- A little before midnight.
- Where'd you put the body?

15:05.530 --> 15:07.364
In the slurry, like you told me to.

15:10.493 --> 15:12.160
What were her last words?

15:14.038 --> 15:15.205
"I'm cold."

15:20.044 --> 15:22.296
Next time I reach out to you,

15:22.380 --> 15:25.882
I don't care if it's a smiley face.
You text me back.

15:26.509 --> 15:28.844
Now, stand over by that bar and look mean.

15:33.099 --> 15:34.850
- Mr Duffy.
- Mr Crowder.

15:34.934 --> 15:37.060
Well, I believe you know everybody here.

15:38.104 --> 15:39.938
I should hope we're old friends by now.

15:40.023 --> 15:42.482
Cousin Johnny,
pour these two gentlemen a drink.

15:42.567 --> 15:45.736
What a good idea. But first, we need to talk.

15:48.072 --> 15:49.698
Well, follow me.

15:52.869 --> 15:55.078
Please, have a seat.

15:56.539 --> 15:58.040
Thank you, sir.

15:59.375 --> 16:01.543
And here I thought we'd begun

16:02.420 --> 16:04.463
to establish a basis of trust.

16:04.547 --> 16:06.590
Well, Mr Duffy, we are not trustworthy men.

16:06.716 --> 16:10.385
There's no reason we can't work together
to build a brighter future.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.638
Remember glasnost?

16:12.930 --> 16:15.223
Well, perestroika happened at the same time.

16:15.642 --> 16:17.392
Now, you know what I want.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.728
Question is, what do you want?

16:25.401 --> 16:28.070
Well, what precipitated
the change in your weather vane?

16:29.322 --> 16:31.615
I need you to help me find someone.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.419
- Yeah, I got her.
- Good.

16:44.504 --> 16:48.215
Yeah, she tried to run off
and didn't get too far with that boot on.

16:48.299 --> 16:50.175
Yeah, lucky you stabbed her last time, then.

16:50.259 --> 16:52.928
- Thinking ahead.
- Hey, hey, Raylan, come here.

16:54.013 --> 16:56.306
When I caught up with her,
you know what that little girl did?

16:57.350 --> 17:00.686
She offered to give me a blowjob.
Can you believe that?

17:03.481 --> 17:04.856
You didn't take her up on it?

17:04.941 --> 17:06.566
No! What... What...

17:06.651 --> 17:08.777
- Raylan, I'm just saying...
- You're just saying.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.362
Yeah, exactly.

17:14.450 --> 17:15.534
How's the foot?

17:17.453 --> 17:18.537
What do you think?

17:19.622 --> 17:20.789
Hurts.

17:22.125 --> 17:24.792
Had my braces tightened,
and my mouth hurts, too.

17:25.294 --> 17:28.255
Well, neither one of us
gonna ask you to use it much.

17:28.339 --> 17:29.589
Just tell me the truth.

17:29.674 --> 17:32.926
You and your boyfriend went into Arlo's.
You put one hole in the wall.

17:33.010 --> 17:35.220
Who told you the bag would be there?

17:36.139 --> 17:37.556
- Your dad.
- You don't know Arlo.

17:37.640 --> 17:40.225
- Arlo don't know you.
- You better tell him, girl.

17:41.519 --> 17:42.936
I do, and he'll kick my ass.

17:43.020 --> 17:46.148
Delicate little flower like you,
who'd do such a thing?

17:47.734 --> 17:49.067
All right.

17:49.861 --> 17:51.236
Josiah sent us.

17:51.863 --> 17:54.156
- Josiah?
- It's her step daddy.

17:54.240 --> 17:57.075
It's the one they strip metal for. Huh?

17:57.160 --> 17:58.368
He lives just up the road.

17:59.162 --> 18:00.203
He there now?

18:00.329 --> 18:01.705
I guarantee it.

18:01.914 --> 18:03.457
Josiah got a last name?

18:03.541 --> 18:04.708
Cairn.

18:05.710 --> 18:08.044
Josiah Cairn is your step daddy?

18:11.758 --> 18:15.385
I know him. Say no more.
And, yeah, he might kick your ass.

18:15.511 --> 18:18.430
- Well, wait. What am I supposed to do?
- Wait here with her till I get back.

18:18.514 --> 18:20.265
And both of you, keep your clothes on.

18:33.863 --> 18:34.905
Josiah Cairn.

18:35.865 --> 18:37.282
Who the hell are you?

18:37.408 --> 18:39.993
Oh, come on, man. I haven't forgotten you.

18:40.077 --> 18:42.788
- Made an impression, did I?
- You could say that.

18:43.372 --> 18:46.875
That bullshit you tried
pulling after the mine explosion in '85.

18:47.418 --> 18:50.504
Taking money from the widows
to try to prove it was the mine's fault,

18:50.588 --> 18:53.590
then taking money from the mine
to try to cover it up.

18:53.716 --> 18:55.383
Surprised to hear you're still in the game.

18:55.718 --> 18:57.886
You're Arlo's boy, Marshal.

18:58.095 --> 19:01.223
You knew that soon as you saw me.
Just like you know why I'm here.

19:01.307 --> 19:03.433
Take your hands out of your pockets.

19:04.769 --> 19:07.979
I ain't got a clue. I'm retired.

19:08.064 --> 19:09.564
Is that right?

19:10.149 --> 19:12.108
It was the young people drove me out.

19:13.444 --> 19:14.903
No values no more.

19:15.655 --> 19:16.905
Now I just

19:17.907 --> 19:21.243
sit out in the sun,
warm my belly like an old dog.

19:21.744 --> 19:23.411
See you even got a collar.

19:25.623 --> 19:28.124
And most of my teeth,
you come close enough.

19:29.961 --> 19:33.255
But you can check with the troopers.
I ain't left this property in months.

19:33.339 --> 19:34.548
Oh, no need to.

19:34.632 --> 19:37.801
Send your little girl
and her boyfriend out to do your dirty work.

19:37.927 --> 19:40.220
Now, where'd you get that idea?

19:40.304 --> 19:44.015
She said Arlo asked you to go in the house
and pull that bag out of the wall.

19:44.267 --> 19:45.433
Bag?

19:45.685 --> 19:47.561
I don't have time for this shit, Josiah.

19:47.645 --> 19:48.854
Ain't got time for what shit?

19:51.649 --> 19:53.859
How about you and me go for a drive?

19:54.485 --> 19:56.611
- You can't do this!
- Sure I can.

19:56.696 --> 19:59.573
- Long as I got gas.
- No! I mean, this ain't legal!

19:59.657 --> 20:02.200
Well, neither is impeding
a federal investigation.

20:02.285 --> 20:03.743
God damn it! Slow down!

20:03.828 --> 20:07.747
Soon as we get past your tether line
or you tell me something worth hearing.

20:07.832 --> 20:09.207
All right, fine. I'll tell you where he's at.

20:09.292 --> 20:11.001
- Who's that?
- Drew Thompson.

20:11.127 --> 20:12.294
That's why you're here, ain't it?

20:14.630 --> 20:15.714
I'm listening.

20:17.049 --> 20:18.300
Just let me catch my breath.

20:19.343 --> 20:22.387
All right, fine, asshole!
He's with the hill people!

20:25.182 --> 20:27.142
- Bullshit.
- No! It ain't!

20:27.310 --> 20:28.393
Now, look.

20:28.644 --> 20:32.105
Drew threw this fella out of a plane
to fake his own death.

20:32.189 --> 20:34.441
- I know that part.
- Yeah, but when Drew jumped out,

20:34.525 --> 20:36.318
he busted both of his legs.

20:36.402 --> 20:39.946
Now, he got word to Bo and Arlo,
and they made a deal.

20:40.031 --> 20:41.323
They got the cocaine,

20:41.407 --> 20:44.159
and he got a place
to hide out and get doctored.

20:44.243 --> 20:45.952
I don't know. It sounds iffy.

20:46.037 --> 20:47.495
No! It ain't!

20:48.372 --> 20:52.042
Look, the man was on the run.
Where else could they take him?

20:52.168 --> 20:55.253
Now, them hill people patched him up,
but he never did heal right.

20:55.338 --> 20:57.380
He's still up there with them,
as one of their own.

21:01.677 --> 21:03.219
- The hills, huh?
- Yeah.

21:04.764 --> 21:07.599
If ol' Drew's still alive,
that's where you'll find him.

21:09.560 --> 21:14.397
If I come down that mountain without him,
you're gonna be my first stop.

21:20.947 --> 21:22.197
...and I just want my stuff.

21:22.281 --> 21:23.531
- Oh, your keepsakes?
- Yeah.

21:23.616 --> 21:25.033
They're in the back of my car,
where you left them.

21:25.117 --> 21:26.910
You can go, by the way.

21:27.620 --> 21:29.287
Are you sure you want to do this?

21:29.538 --> 21:31.081
Where Josiah says he is.

21:32.208 --> 21:33.917
Yeah, unless...

21:34.293 --> 21:35.710
Unless what?

21:36.921 --> 21:38.463
Unless they ate him.

21:38.923 --> 21:41.758
- What?
- Raylan, you know they do that.

21:42.635 --> 21:44.386
That's an old wives' tale, Bob.

21:44.929 --> 21:47.055
Well, look, at least take my go bag.

21:47.598 --> 21:50.725
If it's all the same to you, I'll just take this.

21:52.061 --> 21:54.437
Well, good luck.

21:54.563 --> 21:56.940
- See ya, Bob.
- Not likely.

21:57.483 --> 21:58.733
No, sir.

21:59.652 --> 22:01.319
Nice knowing you, Raylan.

22:29.598 --> 22:31.099
Appreciate you coming down.

22:31.684 --> 22:34.394
Last chance to change your mind.
I'm wearing my walking shoes.

22:34.478 --> 22:36.813
Well, these people don't take to outsiders.

22:36.939 --> 22:38.773
I reckon this is about
as far as you should go.

22:38.941 --> 22:41.109
I knew I should have brought my book.

22:41.277 --> 22:43.570
Is it the one with the monsters
and magic wands?

22:43.654 --> 22:46.865
No, it's a Native American princess who
controls invisible forest animals.

22:46.991 --> 22:48.283
Ain't you too old for those?

22:48.784 --> 22:51.953
I don't know. I was probably too young
to be blowing the head off Taliban.

22:52.038 --> 22:53.163
Guess it all evens out.

22:54.373 --> 22:58.126
If I ain't back by nightfall,
call in some of those ranger friends of yours.

22:58.377 --> 23:01.588
They sound cooler than they are.
How about the 101st Airborne?

23:01.672 --> 23:04.632
- Death from above. There ya go.
- Or maybe I'll just call Art.

23:06.635 --> 23:07.844
Perfect.

23:17.313 --> 23:19.564
- What do you want?
- Johnny wants you.

23:19.648 --> 23:21.649
Well, tell him you can't find me.

23:21.734 --> 23:25.153
Come on, Ava.
Don't make a liar out of my girl.

23:25.571 --> 23:28.490
Jesus, Teri. You could have told
me he was right behind you.

23:29.575 --> 23:32.160
I'll meet you back in your trailer in five.

23:36.165 --> 23:37.832
You always that rough on her?

23:39.210 --> 23:41.961
Johnny, I don't mind you
playing Easy Riderwith one of my girls,

23:42.046 --> 23:44.339
but don't tell me how to run the place.

23:45.508 --> 23:47.634
You packing up Ellen May's things?

23:47.718 --> 23:49.844
Waste of time now, ain't it?

23:50.179 --> 23:51.846
Other girls don't know.

23:52.348 --> 23:54.057
I got to make a show about what I promised.

23:55.851 --> 23:59.187
Put all the stuff in a damn box
and send it to Alabama.

23:59.271 --> 24:02.690
Boyd tell you he's working for Duffy,
some secret mission?

24:02.775 --> 24:04.275
He tell you anything about that?

24:05.027 --> 24:06.236
I got no idea.

24:07.363 --> 24:10.323
Man tries to blow him up,
and now he's got Boyd running around

24:10.407 --> 24:11.741
doing his errands.

24:13.452 --> 24:15.537
You afraid Boyd can't handle himself?

24:16.539 --> 24:19.541
No, I am afraid that
Duffy's gonna come in here

24:19.625 --> 24:21.709
and get us all keeping secrets.

24:21.794 --> 24:24.087
Get us all pinned up against each other.

24:24.547 --> 24:27.132
Look, if Boyd wanted you to know,
I think he would have told you.

24:30.302 --> 24:32.095
That's right, Ava.

24:32.221 --> 24:33.596
You're right.

24:33.722 --> 24:35.974
I'm just forgetting my place.

25:26.275 --> 25:30.820
My name is Raylan Givens.
I come alone and with peaceful intent.

25:35.451 --> 25:36.784
Get up.

25:48.005 --> 25:49.214
Hello, Raylan.

26:01.810 --> 26:05.104
I don't suppose you've been up
to see Josiah Cairn recently?

26:05.189 --> 26:06.731
That guy's an asshole.

26:07.900 --> 26:11.486
Did he tell you he's just an old
dog sitting on a porch now?

26:11.862 --> 26:13.071
He scratched himself.

26:13.155 --> 26:15.573
Said kids today have no values.

26:15.908 --> 26:18.826
You know, he sends his stepdaughter out
to steal copper wire

26:18.911 --> 26:20.578
so she can pay for her own braces.

26:20.663 --> 26:22.080
Well, I'll be.

26:22.248 --> 26:24.290
Still, I can see him
sending you up to an early end,

26:24.375 --> 26:25.708
you being who you are,

26:26.543 --> 26:29.003
but I thought he and I
were better friends than that.

26:29.088 --> 26:30.421
Why's that?

26:30.506 --> 26:33.341
You got that
"honour amongst dumbass thieves" thing?

26:33.425 --> 26:37.011
"Dumbass"? Coming from the
man sitting tied up next to me?

26:41.392 --> 26:47.021
So, Arlo takes the fall for you,
and this is how you repay him, huh?

26:47.731 --> 26:50.024
Go out, look for Drew,
try to screw up his deal?

26:50.359 --> 26:53.653
Whole world's a tree, Raylan.
I'm just a squirrel trying to get a nut.

26:53.737 --> 26:58.116
Maybe you're just a puppet
working for the Frankfort boys.

26:58.200 --> 27:00.285
Is that what you are now, a puppet?

27:00.953 --> 27:02.704
You want to start a fight, Raylan?

27:03.038 --> 27:05.790
Nine times out of 10,
I'd be more than happy to accommodate.

27:06.125 --> 27:09.711
But right now,
I think we got more pressing concerns.

27:38.073 --> 27:39.407
Nice boots.

27:44.413 --> 27:45.872
Where'd you serve?

27:48.542 --> 27:51.127
Hey... Hey, fellas?

27:51.754 --> 27:53.379
You guys are out there, right?

27:53.714 --> 27:57.800
I got a photograph here
I think is gonna sort this whole thing out.

27:57.926 --> 28:00.303
- Got to wait for Cope.
- Who's Cope?

28:00.429 --> 28:02.263
Cope gonna decide how you die.

28:02.723 --> 28:04.057
Shut up, Daniel!

28:05.601 --> 28:07.685
It's a picture of my mama as a little girl.

28:07.770 --> 28:11.022
And the girl standing next to her
is one of yours.

28:11.106 --> 28:12.940
Cousin Mary, my mama called her.

28:13.067 --> 28:15.193
If you like, I can poke my head in there
with my rifle,

28:15.277 --> 28:16.402
let you jump me.

28:16.987 --> 28:19.155
I'll stick it through the door if you like.

28:19.281 --> 28:20.615
I ain't stupid.

28:20.741 --> 28:22.241
No, I'm not saying you are.

28:22.576 --> 28:24.118
Look, it's Daniel, right?

28:26.288 --> 28:27.455
Daniel, come over here.

28:35.297 --> 28:36.631
I don't like your plan, Raylan!

28:44.473 --> 28:45.765
You were gonna jump me.

28:47.643 --> 28:48.893
How about you jump me now?

28:48.977 --> 28:53.106
Well, it don't seem quite fair.
My hands tied and you with that rifle.

28:56.693 --> 28:58.528
About as fair as it's gonna get.

29:11.542 --> 29:14.001
No! Cope! Cope!

29:14.711 --> 29:16.379
You better drop that rifle, boy!

29:18.006 --> 29:19.674
Stop! Stop it!

29:20.050 --> 29:21.342
Hey! Hey!

29:21.635 --> 29:23.386
You better drop that rifle, boy!

29:24.847 --> 29:26.722
Hey! Hey!

29:36.066 --> 29:37.316
No, sir.

29:38.068 --> 29:39.485
I'm sorry, Cope.

29:39.987 --> 29:42.822
It's all right, boy. I'm here now.

29:42.906 --> 29:46.075
All right, listen. I don't want to kill you.

29:46.201 --> 29:48.369
And you don't want to be dead.

29:48.662 --> 29:50.580
We're just looking for Drew Thompson.

29:50.706 --> 29:52.832
That ain't what Josiah told me
when he called.

29:53.542 --> 29:54.542
He called?

29:54.668 --> 29:57.253
Ain't the darkest of Africa. We got a phone.

29:57.838 --> 29:58.963
Well, you know Josiah,

29:59.047 --> 30:00.882
then you ought to know
whatever comes out of his mouth

30:01.008 --> 30:02.550
is half-truth at best.

30:03.051 --> 30:05.595
I do some trading with the man.
Barely know him.

30:06.013 --> 30:07.346
Still better than I know you.

30:07.514 --> 30:09.557
Sir, I'm a deputy US Marshal.

30:09.683 --> 30:11.726
Josiah said you'd say that, too.

30:12.352 --> 30:15.938
Daniel, how about you just
hum your tune now, boy?

30:18.108 --> 30:20.735
What a fellowship

30:20.861 --> 30:23.196
What a joy divine

30:23.405 --> 30:28.201
Leaning on the everlasting arms

30:30.245 --> 30:32.371
Rock fell on Daniel when he was a boy.

30:32.915 --> 30:35.374
Now, I love him in spite,

30:36.627 --> 30:38.920
but I would never give him a working gun.

30:40.881 --> 30:42.423
It's got no firing pin.

30:52.059 --> 30:54.143
For the record,
wasn't Daniel who let us loose.

30:54.269 --> 30:56.771
That other one let us out,
keen on knocking us around.

30:56.897 --> 30:58.064
He tried to trick us.

30:58.148 --> 31:00.566
This one here tried to tell us
he's related to Mary.

31:01.151 --> 31:02.443
It wasn't a trick.

31:02.611 --> 31:03.903
Hold up! Stop!

31:05.781 --> 31:07.573
You claiming kinship now, are ya?

31:07.658 --> 31:09.242
Yes, sir. I am.

31:09.409 --> 31:12.578
Mary's your kin?
My guess is, you know her pap's name?

31:14.122 --> 31:16.290
Old Caleb White. God rest his soul.

31:16.416 --> 31:17.542
You see, I had a photograph...

31:17.626 --> 31:21.462
Maybe you know the unusual circumstances
to Mary's uncle Lidon's demise.

31:21.672 --> 31:23.464
Everybody what's kin knows that story.

31:24.258 --> 31:25.299
Can't say I do.

31:25.425 --> 31:26.801
Ever hear of Sanderson B?

31:26.927 --> 31:31.138
I've heard of Sanderson B. I know him.
We played pee-wee football together.

31:31.348 --> 31:34.308
There are mines up here been
abandoned since 'fore I was born.

31:34.601 --> 31:37.436
Sanderson B shaft is one of them.

31:37.980 --> 31:40.147
171 -foot vertical entry.

31:40.857 --> 31:42.817
That's gonna be your final resting place.

31:43.026 --> 31:46.445
Well, hold on, now! We can talk about this.

31:48.490 --> 31:51.117
Now, keep in mind, there's another Marshal
at the bottom of this mountain.

31:51.201 --> 31:53.995
- Yeah, he long-hair or the short-hair?
- What are you talking about?

31:54.121 --> 31:56.205
We'll take care of him if he come up here.

31:56.331 --> 31:59.125
Not that US currency has any value up here,

31:59.209 --> 32:02.044
but if you'd be inclined to take it,
I'd be more than happy to provide it...

32:02.170 --> 32:03.838
You can stop talking now!

32:04.131 --> 32:05.631
Poking around for Drew.

32:06.216 --> 32:08.843
- He'd have killed you his own self.
- You saying he's here?

32:09.511 --> 32:10.970
- Not here.
- Hereabouts?

32:11.305 --> 32:12.555
Harlan County?

32:12.889 --> 32:14.348
Raylan Givens?

32:18.020 --> 32:20.646
Daniel, did you fetch her?

32:21.023 --> 32:22.148
Brought this to me.

32:27.571 --> 32:28.821
I see Frances in you.

32:31.325 --> 32:32.491
You're Mary?

32:32.993 --> 32:34.577
Josiah said we best kill both of 'em.

32:35.203 --> 32:36.996
Not my cousin's boy.

32:39.333 --> 32:40.374
What about that one?

32:41.168 --> 32:42.335
You can have him.

32:42.878 --> 32:46.047
Well, now, hold on a second!
Raylan? Raylan!

32:46.173 --> 32:49.008
Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait, Mary!

32:51.178 --> 32:54.096
Me being Marshal service,
sworn to uphold the law and all,

32:54.264 --> 32:55.848
I get to the bottom of this mountain,

32:56.016 --> 32:58.017
I'll be compelled to report
what happened up here.

32:58.560 --> 33:00.895
If you kill him, it could be bad for you.

33:01.897 --> 33:03.731
So, we're back to killing both of 'em?

33:06.026 --> 33:09.362
I say most expedient path
would be to let 'em both go.

33:13.033 --> 33:15.076
Man you're looking for ain't here.

33:15.911 --> 33:17.411
Was a time I thought he'd stay.

33:18.372 --> 33:21.415
Him near-helpless,
me nursing him back to health.

33:22.250 --> 33:24.251
I woke up one day, he's gone.

33:24.711 --> 33:26.921
The way Cope said it,
sounded like he didn't go far.

33:27.047 --> 33:28.464
Oh, said that, did he?

33:28.590 --> 33:31.926
A fella with that much
cocaine could parlay it into a lot of money,

33:32.052 --> 33:34.095
make him a very powerful man.

33:34.763 --> 33:37.598
Your daddies took all that
cocaine for themselves.

33:37.724 --> 33:40.267
'Course they did. That's another
reason we're so proud of them.

33:40.769 --> 33:43.646
I don't know why Josiah told you
Drew's still up here.

33:45.565 --> 33:47.900
Only time I seen him
since he left was near 10 years ago

33:47.984 --> 33:49.735
at the bluegrass festival,

33:50.320 --> 33:52.863
rubbing shoulders with the mayor,
judge executive.

33:52.948 --> 33:55.574
All them rich Clover Hill folks.

33:56.576 --> 33:57.785
Didn't seem to notice me.

33:58.954 --> 34:00.287
Or didn't care to.

34:02.749 --> 34:04.458
You're looking for Drew Thompson.

34:08.922 --> 34:10.589
You're on the wrong hill.

34:11.757 --> 34:14.217
I never knew you had hills
in your blood, Raylan.

34:14.302 --> 34:15.469
I do.

34:15.594 --> 34:17.596
I'd whistle the theme song
to Deliverance if I thought

34:17.681 --> 34:18.931
you had a better sense of humour.

34:19.933 --> 34:23.436
My mama was never embarrassed by it,
but Arlo didn't like her talking about it.

34:23.603 --> 34:25.271
Came in handy, though, didn't it?

34:25.355 --> 34:28.482
- For our daddies 30 years ago, for us today.
- Yep. Now here we are.

34:28.608 --> 34:31.610
Both in pursuit of a man
our daddies went to great pains to hide.

34:31.695 --> 34:32.987
Well,

34:34.322 --> 34:37.783
I guess this is where we say,
"May the best man win."

34:38.368 --> 34:39.493
Should we shake on it?

34:47.460 --> 34:49.462
What are you talking about,
no sense of humour?

34:49.545 --> 34:52.172
This is funny. I know I'm laughing.

34:53.132 --> 34:54.884
I've come to a conclusion.

34:55.177 --> 34:56.802
I don't like you, Raylan.

34:57.137 --> 34:59.138
Never liked you much neither, Boyd.

35:05.604 --> 35:10.107
Well, it's a lot like here, if you think about it.
Bunch of clans led by guys with beards,

35:10.192 --> 35:12.610
running around shooting
at each other all the time.

35:12.778 --> 35:16.363
- Except here, they're not speaking Pashto.
- They might as well be, though. Sometimes.

35:18.116 --> 35:20.284
Let me ask you,
you being with the Marshal service and all,

35:20.368 --> 35:23.162
you're really good
at, like, finding people, right?

35:23.830 --> 35:24.955
- I hope so.
- All right.

35:25.040 --> 35:26.373
Where do you start?

35:27.125 --> 35:30.503
Let's say someone just ups and disappears.

35:30.879 --> 35:32.046
Poof!

35:32.339 --> 35:33.672
And they don't want to be found.

35:34.549 --> 35:38.135
You're interested, the Marshal service
hires a lot of former military.

35:38.220 --> 35:40.054
An MP would be a prime candidate.

35:40.180 --> 35:43.891
If you got a phone number or an address,
I can send you some information.

35:44.017 --> 35:45.392
Nah, I don't think so.

35:48.980 --> 35:51.315
Tim! Get to Vasquez.

35:51.399 --> 35:53.734
Tell him to put a hold on that Arlo deal.

35:53.819 --> 35:56.654
We got a line on Drew. He's here in Harlan.

35:56.738 --> 36:00.074
You telling me, in a matter of hours,
you narrowed down this guy's location

36:00.158 --> 36:01.909
from anywhere in the world to one county?

36:02.244 --> 36:04.995
Well, it wasn't as easy as it sounds.

36:07.040 --> 36:08.332
You waiting for Boyd?

36:09.501 --> 36:11.585
He's up the trail about a mile or so.

36:12.045 --> 36:13.170
You got a saw?

36:14.548 --> 36:15.923
You're gonna need a saw.

36:22.931 --> 36:24.265
What I found out today,

36:24.391 --> 36:26.767
I expect I have your man Drew
within the week.

36:26.893 --> 36:28.602
That's impressive work, Mr Crowder.

36:28.728 --> 36:31.605
Not as impressive as
what I'm about to ask for.

36:32.399 --> 36:33.774
Is that right?

36:33.859 --> 36:35.609
The new price for Drew is,

36:36.027 --> 36:38.904
I get half the heroin business
in the state of Kentucky.

36:39.573 --> 36:43.409
Really? And I thought 20,000 was generous.

36:43.743 --> 36:45.369
And I thought you were
serious about finding a man

36:45.453 --> 36:48.414
who's evaded the FBI for
the better part of 30 years.

36:49.916 --> 36:52.626
Oh, Mr Crowder, you are tenacious.

36:52.711 --> 36:54.378
I hate that in a person.

36:54.921 --> 36:56.088
You have a deal.

36:56.464 --> 36:58.966
Well, it's a pleasure doing
business with you, Wynn!

36:59.301 --> 37:00.467
Yeah.

37:01.720 --> 37:04.138
Well, hey, what the hell?
I thought we had a deal.

37:09.102 --> 37:10.477
Mr Crowder,

37:10.979 --> 37:14.440
I can promise him
a rocket ship and a goddamn unicorn.

37:15.150 --> 37:18.110
The point is, once he brings me Drew,
he and I are done.

37:19.279 --> 37:21.572
And you're free to kill him.

37:29.289 --> 37:30.998
- Evening.
- Where's Ellen May?

37:31.791 --> 37:33.709
You all right, son?
You want to come in, have a bite to eat?

37:33.793 --> 37:35.336
No, I just want the girl!

37:35.420 --> 37:37.880
Well, I talked to all of my deputies,
and it wasn't one of them.

37:37.964 --> 37:40.299
Yeah, bullshit. Someone's lying.

37:40.383 --> 37:43.761
I saw a sheriff's car on the security tape.

37:43.845 --> 37:46.972
That's right.
One of my deputies was there last night,

37:47.432 --> 37:50.643
and he saw a girl
who fits Ellen May's description

37:50.727 --> 37:52.436
get waved over to an 18-wheeler.

37:53.313 --> 37:55.731
Said she seemed
to recognise the man driving.

37:55.815 --> 37:56.982
Said she climbed right in.

37:57.400 --> 37:59.818
- Which way did they go?
- That, I don't know.

38:00.403 --> 38:02.071
He thinks it had Tennessee plates.

38:02.155 --> 38:04.615
Lot of good that'll do
with a long-haul trucker.

38:05.784 --> 38:07.201
Shit.

38:07.786 --> 38:08.953
Shit!

38:09.037 --> 38:11.455
I could check the weigh stations.
Maybe get lucky.

38:11.539 --> 38:13.332
No, don't do anything yet.

38:13.833 --> 38:15.501
I will tell you if I need you.

38:17.420 --> 38:20.255
And don't bother Boyd with this.

38:20.340 --> 38:23.509
If you find something, talk to me.
I'll handle it.

38:24.928 --> 38:26.762
- Are we clear?
- I understand.

38:44.364 --> 38:46.073
You believe me now?

38:47.617 --> 38:51.036
Boyd and Ava intended that man to kill you.

38:53.123 --> 38:56.375
The way Boyd had me press
that preacher's sister, I figure,

38:57.210 --> 38:59.837
you must know something
that could hurt him real bad.

39:01.923 --> 39:04.800
But you invited him in here.

39:08.096 --> 39:10.472
What if he did come in and see me?

39:11.349 --> 39:12.516
I'd have shot him.

39:14.394 --> 39:16.562
I ain't gonna let anybody hurt you, Ellen May.

39:17.897 --> 39:19.106
But I got a job to do.

39:20.191 --> 39:21.859
And I can't do it alone.

39:22.652 --> 39:24.236
If you're willing,

39:26.740 --> 39:29.825
maybe you can help me
bring down Boyd Crowder.

39:32.746 --> 39:34.455
I was disappointed to hear about this deal

39:34.539 --> 39:36.999
Arlo's poised to make
to give him his freedom.

39:37.751 --> 39:40.294
Disappointed? I don't understand.

39:40.378 --> 39:42.337
Well, disappointed I didn't hear it from you.

39:42.589 --> 39:45.257
I am Arlo Givens' attorney.

39:45.341 --> 39:46.842
On my dime.

39:48.803 --> 39:52.389
Colleague of mine some time ago
had a man come into his office,

39:52.474 --> 39:55.893
lay down money in front of him,
get him to break confidentiality.

39:56.269 --> 39:59.521
Soon as he did, 10 federal agents
busted in and carted him off.

40:00.899 --> 40:03.150
Well, Miss Gable, that is very good to hear.

40:04.110 --> 40:05.360
What is?

40:05.445 --> 40:07.946
That the only thing you're concerned about...

40:10.158 --> 40:11.784
Is getting caught.

40:16.623 --> 40:18.665
Now, that's for getting Arlo that deal.

40:21.127 --> 40:22.461
And that

40:24.005 --> 40:26.006
is for shutting that deal down.

40:53.618 --> 40:56.411
Josiah! It's Raylan Givens.

40:56.996 --> 40:58.664
Back for another chat.

41:02.293 --> 41:06.046
I've already been shot at through
a door once today, thank you.

41:06.131 --> 41:07.756
Best not make it twice.

41:18.351 --> 41:19.935
How the hell did you do that?

41:38.371 --> 41:40.455
Well, my goodness.
