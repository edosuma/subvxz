WEBVTT

00:01.930 --> 00:03.363
Previously on "Salem"...

00:03.400 --> 00:05.618
The terror gutside drives
refugees Into Salem,

00:05.670 --> 00:08.366
where soon they all,
including my dear father,

00:08.400 --> 00:12.370
will be with the burning candles
that ignite my inauguration.

00:12.410 --> 00:14.674
_ Serve him
In the most minimal of ways,

00:14.710 --> 00:16.200
and he will allow you
and my sister

00:16.250 --> 00:17.569
to live happily ever after.

00:17.610 --> 00:18.975
Say the wrong thing
and you will die.

00:19.010 --> 00:20.819
CO'I'I'ON: Little Sibley
is dedicated

00:20.850 --> 00:25.480
to growing and rebuilding Salem
until it truly is Jerusalem!

00:25.520 --> 00:27.078
It is one thing
to lay low.

00:27.120 --> 00:29.350
It is something else
to do the devil's work for him.

00:29.390 --> 00:31.858
I am now as always
serving God.

00:31.890 --> 00:33.426
Do you ever think
you knew a man,

00:33.460 --> 00:35.121
come to find out you didn't know
what he was at all?

00:36.130 --> 00:38.098
What have you done to me?

00:38.130 --> 00:39.563
I think we're
being followed.

00:39.600 --> 00:42.535
I saved her
from that ogress Mercy Lewis.

00:42.570 --> 00:44.106
Now I can't shake her.

00:44.140 --> 00:46.700
I still have friends
in this town.

00:46.740 --> 00:49.675
I told them one night
I'd call for them.

00:49.710 --> 00:52.076
If you want to save
the life of your love,

00:52.120 --> 00:53.417
you must kill your son.

00:53.450 --> 00:56.214
Mother! Please!
(gasps)

00:56.250 --> 00:59.356
Mother, you failed
my final test.

00:59.390 --> 01:02.450
(gagging)

01:12.270 --> 01:16.366
Why did God
ever place an immortal soul

01:16.410 --> 01:19.709
into such a fragile vessel?

01:19.740 --> 01:23.107
A mayfly in the face
of eternity.

01:23.150 --> 01:24.401
BOY: Release her.

01:31.820 --> 01:33.310
(moans)

01:33.360 --> 01:36.158
Is this the mighty
Angel of Death?

01:36.190 --> 01:38.658
When did you ever
spare a life?

01:38.690 --> 01:40.226
This life is precious
to me.

01:40.260 --> 01:43.388
Has that tiny
meat suit corrupted you?

01:43.430 --> 01:48.788
This human body is a pitiful sac
of blood, piss, and water.

01:48.840 --> 01:52.105
I fear in your case,
mostly piss.

01:52.140 --> 01:54.802
She is my mother --

01:54.840 --> 01:56.444
a love you know nothing of.

01:56.480 --> 01:58.300
Do not be blinded
by mother love.

01:58.350 --> 01:59.612
Or mother lust.

01:59.650 --> 02:02.289
You cannot_ let this
go unpunIshed.

02:02.320 --> 02:04.845
There are punishments
far worse than death.

02:04.890 --> 02:06.482
Trust me.

02:10.190 --> 02:13.421
I did. Once.

02:13.460 --> 02:16.520
I persuaded a full legion
of our brothers to follow you

02:16.570 --> 02:18.868
and throw God,
that ungrateful tyrant,

02:18.900 --> 02:20.367
from His celestial throne.

02:20.400 --> 02:23.938
Our fellow fallen
still pay the price.

02:23.970 --> 02:28.179
Can you not hear their cries
echoing from hell?

02:28.210 --> 02:31.270
Rest assured.

02:31.310 --> 02:36.111
Our brothers will be freed
and our tyrant father will weep.

02:36.150 --> 02:39.586
But I would have my mother
beside me then.

02:40.860 --> 02:43.328
Beside you?

02:43.360 --> 02:45.282
Or beneath you?

02:45.330 --> 02:49.494
Just what exactly do you plan
to have her with?

02:49.530 --> 02:52.169
That boy's tiny member?

02:52.200 --> 02:54.794
Or will one of
your wretched witches

02:54.840 --> 02:57.138
snatch a grown man's --

02:57.170 --> 02:58.831
Oh! (groans)

02:58.870 --> 03:02.033
These suits of meat
are capable

03:02.080 --> 03:05.971
of the most exquisite pain.

03:06.010 --> 03:08.843
(gasps, sighs)

03:11.920 --> 03:14.115
Pleasure, too.

03:18.790 --> 03:20.519
Try it.

03:20.560 --> 03:22.494
They make delightful drinks

03:22.530 --> 03:26.398
that go far to relieve some of
the pain of incarnation.

03:29.200 --> 03:32.829
There is not one I would rather
have fight beside me.

03:32.880 --> 03:35.599
But an army may only
have one leader --

03:35.640 --> 03:38.848
else,
like a two-headed snake,

03:38.880 --> 03:42.611
it may strike itself
with its own fangs.

03:45.720 --> 03:51.124
Now, place my mother somewhere
secure to await her reckoning.

03:53.900 --> 03:55.390
(glass thuds lightly)

04:08.940 --> 04:10.407
(strains)

04:10.450 --> 04:12.042
Good.
You're awake.

04:12.080 --> 04:13.069
(moans)

04:13.120 --> 04:14.542
I am no incubus

04:14.580 --> 04:17.811
that takes pleasure
in the sleeping.

04:17.850 --> 04:20.978
I would have your spirit sharp
when I teach you

04:21.020 --> 04:23.784
just how foul and helpless
your body is.

04:26.930 --> 04:30.422
Not worth the pathetic strength
that remains.

04:30.470 --> 04:32.665
You are not my master.

04:32.700 --> 04:34.065
I know.

04:34.100 --> 04:37.001
IfI were,
you would no longer draw breath.

04:52.220 --> 04:54.450
You surprise me, servant.

04:54.490 --> 04:58.779
I expected some dark, damp,
mildewing dungeon.

04:58.830 --> 05:00.923
No need.

05:00.960 --> 05:03.667
I built this place.

05:03.700 --> 05:08.034
Not this house,
but the world.

05:08.070 --> 05:10.834
Helped forge
its geometries.

05:10.870 --> 05:12.872
(mechanical whirring)

05:19.250 --> 05:25.610
(distorted voice)
And I retain all the keys to all
the locks on all the doors --

05:25.650 --> 05:28.653
(normal voice) so I may make
a dungeon in a grain of sand

05:28.690 --> 05:32.126
(distorted voice) large enough
to contain your soul.

05:32.160 --> 05:33.195
(panﬁng)

05:33.230 --> 05:36.051
You bastard!

05:36.100 --> 05:38.796
(pounding)

05:38.830 --> 05:40.934
("Cupid Carries a Gun" plays)

05:46.510 --> 05:49.206
* Pound me the witch drums

05:49.240 --> 05:50.468
* Witch drums

05:50.510 --> 05:54.514
* Pound me the witch drums

05:54.550 --> 05:57.314
* Pound me the witch drums

05:57.350 --> 05:58.715
* The witch drums

05:58.750 --> 06:01.355
* Better pray for hell

06:01.390 --> 06:06.623
* Not hallelujah

06:24.650 --> 06:27.813
(indistinct conversations)

06:28.450 --> 06:31.908
(thinking) Take a hair
of the witch that bit you...

06:34.060 --> 06:36.119
Add bear's breech,

06:36.160 --> 06:38.526
columbine, henbane, hyacinth,

06:38.560 --> 06:41.051
larkspur, mandrake, mugwort,
and nettle.

06:41.100 --> 06:43.421
Suspended in potent spirits.

06:58.180 --> 07:00.216
Mm.

07:00.250 --> 07:04.380
Only one way to destroy
a familiar.

07:04.420 --> 07:06.479
From within.

07:07.520 --> 07:08.953
Remember the list.

07:08.990 --> 07:10.548
Write nothing down.

07:10.590 --> 07:12.319
Bear's breech, columbine,

07:12.360 --> 07:14.225
henbane, hyacinth, larkspur,

07:14.260 --> 07:16.148
mandrake, mugwort, and nettle.

07:16.200 --> 07:17.428
Again.

07:17.470 --> 07:19.165
Bear's breech, columbine,

07:19.200 --> 07:21.088
henbane, hyacinth, larkspur,

07:21.140 --> 07:24.439
mandrake, mugwort, and nettle.

07:24.470 --> 07:27.405
But even if I find
the necessary herbs,

07:27.440 --> 07:30.876
I must have strong drink
to fire it in my belly.

07:33.280 --> 07:35.145
(groaning)

07:40.490 --> 07:43.323
What is happening to me?

07:45.560 --> 07:48.757
MERCY: Your body dies
inch by inch.

07:48.800 --> 07:52.258
And as your tongue rots inside
your mouth,

07:52.300 --> 07:55.394
you'll soon lose the power
of speech.

07:58.310 --> 08:01.871
So I advise you, waste
no time in questions.

08:01.910 --> 08:04.208
(moans)

08:04.250 --> 08:07.469
All fours now.

08:07.520 --> 08:09.579
Like a dog.

08:18.330 --> 08:20.719
Show me that vestige
of a tongue

08:20.760 --> 08:24.321
before there isn't enough left
of it to please me.

08:28.540 --> 08:31.407
Ahhhh.

08:33.010 --> 08:34.500
(makes guttural sound)

08:43.050 --> 08:45.211
(breathing sharply)

08:48.790 --> 08:50.451
Thank God.

08:52.060 --> 08:53.596
Thank God.

08:53.630 --> 08:54.892
Ohh!

08:54.930 --> 08:57.194
No. You thank me.

08:57.230 --> 09:00.233
(exhales slowly)

09:03.770 --> 09:05.704
(groans)

09:05.740 --> 09:08.334
See (laughs)

09:08.380 --> 09:12.612
the ability to stop you
is one of my gifts.

09:12.650 --> 09:15.039
And you'll come to
enjoy it, too.

09:15.080 --> 09:21.087
It can be used to prolong things
in a most delightful way.

09:21.120 --> 09:24.055
What do you want?

09:24.090 --> 09:29.118
At first,
I wanted revenge.

09:29.160 --> 09:32.561
Revenge on your contempt
for women,

09:32.600 --> 09:36.263
exceeded only by your desire
to just use them.

09:39.780 --> 09:41.338
But then I...

09:43.750 --> 09:46.241
...I saw something in you.

09:48.950 --> 09:53.057
Something that looked
much like...

09:53.090 --> 09:54.955
me.

09:59.260 --> 10:01.990
Unloved creatures...

10:02.030 --> 10:06.262
both, who have clawed out of
the dark corners.

10:06.300 --> 10:09.235
Self-made and on the make.

10:09.270 --> 10:12.774
You see...

10:12.810 --> 10:16.940
the poison I gave you
is quite permanent.

10:16.980 --> 10:21.849
And the remedy is
very, very temporary.

10:23.820 --> 10:27.278
This pain...

10:27.320 --> 10:28.617
will return?

10:28.660 --> 10:30.287
(shudders)

10:30.330 --> 10:33.754
Stop. Stop it. Stop.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.495
But I will be here...

10:35.530 --> 10:37.691
nightly...

10:42.300 --> 10:45.838
...with your portion
of relief.

10:45.870 --> 10:48.031
(sighs)

10:50.150 --> 10:52.175
So, come.

10:54.250 --> 10:56.514
Come.

10:56.550 --> 11:00.589
Put that restored tongue to
better use than talking.

11:09.060 --> 11:10.698
(bird chirping)

11:18.240 --> 11:20.834
Cotton?

11:24.080 --> 11:26.674
What are you doing
out here?

11:40.600 --> 11:42.397
(chuckles)

11:47.270 --> 11:49.363
Tonight was...

11:49.400 --> 11:53.678
everything I dreamt
our first time would be.

11:53.710 --> 11:56.531
You were so tender...

11:56.580 --> 11:58.673
and so fierce.

11:58.710 --> 12:01.747
Cotton...

12:01.780 --> 12:06.513
I feel like I already have
our future growing inside me.

12:06.550 --> 12:10.486
It's too soon to tell,
but I hope --

12:15.500 --> 12:21.234
Faith, hope, and charity.

12:21.270 --> 12:24.899
And the greatest of these
is hope.

12:24.940 --> 12:29.274
Who am I to correct the great
Reverend Cotton Mather?

12:29.310 --> 12:33.269
But I believe the Bible says the
greatest of these is charity.

12:33.320 --> 12:36.710
Holding you, I believe
that the Bible was wrong.

12:36.750 --> 12:38.945
(explosion)

12:38.990 --> 12:41.584
(screaming and dog barking
in distance)

12:44.430 --> 12:46.921
ISAAC:
What in God's name?

12:55.840 --> 12:58.161
It ain't safe for you to be
following me about.

12:58.210 --> 13:02.203
Just be gone by the time
I get back.

13:05.810 --> 13:07.641
(indistinct conversations)

13:18.460 --> 13:21.122
(dog barking)

13:40.520 --> 13:42.738
Is it the end of the world?

13:44.490 --> 13:47.709
No doubt the end
of someone's world.

13:49.930 --> 13:53.320
JOHN: It had the ring
of a cannon.

13:53.360 --> 13:57.490
Or a thousand cannons_ shot
at exactly the same time.

14:42.410 --> 14:44.947
JOHN: The explosion
came from Deerfield.

14:44.980 --> 14:46.845
I was just
at the barricade.

14:46.880 --> 14:50.611
A rider arrived like one of the
four horsemen, covered In ash.

14:50.650 --> 14:54.518
He said the sky above Deerfield
was blood red.

14:54.560 --> 14:56.357
(people murmuring loudly)

14:56.390 --> 14:58.858
Every settlement between there
and here is being emptied out,

14:58.890 --> 15:01.029
and the people are coming here
for refuge.

15:01.060 --> 15:02.357
So I need to take my men --

15:02.400 --> 15:03.719
TREASURER PUTNAM:
Leave us unarmed?

15:03.770 --> 15:05.624
There could be women
and children there,

15:05.670 --> 15:07.092
too injured to leave.

15:07.140 --> 15:08.630
What about our women
and children?

15:08.670 --> 15:09.864
(people murmuring agreement)

15:09.900 --> 15:11.606
Mr. Hathorne,
would you put the safety

15:11.640 --> 15:12.800
of strangers before our own?

15:12.840 --> 15:14.102
Of course not,
Mr. Putnam.

15:14.140 --> 15:16.028
While we argue,
people are dying.

15:16.080 --> 15:19.470
The militia would be better used
clearing those already here.

15:19.510 --> 15:21.273
If you think
there aren't enough militia

15:21.320 --> 15:22.810
to defend this town,
try using them

15:22.850 --> 15:24.818
to force out nearly a third
of the population.

15:24.850 --> 15:26.647
It'll be total chaos!

15:26.690 --> 15:27.816
(people murmur agreement)

15:27.860 --> 15:29.487
People, please. Please.

15:29.520 --> 15:34.799
_ Let us not allow these
Irrational fears to mate us.

15:34.830 --> 15:37.162
We shall save any decision
until this evening

15:37.200 --> 15:39.122
when calmer heads may prevail.

15:39.170 --> 15:41.559
Today or tonight --
no matter.

15:41.600 --> 15:43.158
I will demand a vote.

15:43.210 --> 15:47.909
Clear the town of heretic
and refugee scum.

15:47.940 --> 15:50.340
Then seal Salem.

15:50.380 --> 15:52.075
Protect ourselves.

15:52.110 --> 15:54.476
I need to know what's out there
to know what we face.

15:54.520 --> 15:57.341
No. I order you to remain here
with your men.

15:57.390 --> 15:58.789
(chuckling) Fine.

15:58.820 --> 16:02.916
I'll leave the men behind.
I'll take one.

16:02.960 --> 16:05.781
I'll take...

16:05.830 --> 16:07.252
him.

16:07.300 --> 16:10.497
A man and a boy
against the French army

16:10.530 --> 16:12.521
and those demonic natives?

16:12.570 --> 16:13.696
(scoffing) Fine.

16:13.740 --> 16:16.163
Let it be your death,
not ours.

16:16.200 --> 16:18.065
I ain't afraid.

16:21.540 --> 16:22.905
Come on.

16:25.750 --> 16:27.240
(indistinct talking)

16:29.150 --> 16:31.118
(chatter)

16:31.150 --> 16:33.983
Please, people, stay calm.

16:34.020 --> 16:35.612
There will be
a meeting tonight,

16:35.660 --> 16:37.059
and a decision
WIll be made.

16:37.090 --> 16:38.227
Keep calm.

16:38.260 --> 16:39.454
We need to hear,
our lordship.

16:39.490 --> 16:42.095
Later. Please.
Stay calm.

16:47.070 --> 16:49.698
I know who killed
that man in Knockers Hole.

16:49.740 --> 16:52.732
Isaac -- for God's sake,
look around you.

16:52.770 --> 16:54.909
Salem is turned
upSIde down.

16:54.940 --> 16:57.204
War rages outside
in the woods.

16:57.250 --> 16:58.979
We're overrun
WIth strangers.

16:59.010 --> 17:02.571
Who cares for one more dead
wastrel In Knockers Hole?

17:02.620 --> 17:06.488
I can't do anything
about the war out there.

17:06.520 --> 17:08.715
But I can do this one thing.

17:08.760 --> 17:11.320
I can prove that you can't
just kill someone

17:11.360 --> 17:12.554
and get away with it.

17:12.590 --> 17:14.091
I know who done it.

17:14.130 --> 17:18.521
One bad man kills another --
eIther way we WIn.

17:18.570 --> 17:22.836
This ain't no bad man.

17:22.870 --> 17:24.929
It ain't a man.

17:24.970 --> 17:27.530
And she's killed before.

17:27.580 --> 17:29.275
It's Mercy Lewis.

17:29.310 --> 17:31.801
And she's running
that new brothel.

17:38.650 --> 17:40.459
You know_this
for certaIn?

17:40.490 --> 17:41.752
Oh, I seen her.

17:41.790 --> 17:47.626
The mind, Isaac,
plays tricks.

17:47.660 --> 17:51.027
Especially a mind that has
suffered as much as you have.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.061
No, I ain't imagined it.

17:53.100 --> 17:55.034
She killed that man.
I know it.

17:55.070 --> 17:56.958
Just like she killed
my Dollie.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.037
Ah -- so that's
what this is about.

18:00.070 --> 18:02.300
Justice for Dollie.

18:02.340 --> 18:04.103
No, I'm sorry, Isaac.

18:04.150 --> 18:08.314
That_ is the sacrifice that we
pubIIc servants must make.

18:08.350 --> 18:13.151
To put public safety over and
above our own private vendettas.

18:13.190 --> 18:14.316
I know --

18:14.360 --> 18:15.987
I'm telling you
here and now,

18:16.020 --> 18:19.626
if you can't let it go,
you're off the Night Watch.

18:19.660 --> 18:20.991
Understood?

18:35.110 --> 18:38.102
CHILDREN:
* Sickened on a Friday

18:38.150 --> 18:41.074
* Died on Saturday

18:41.120 --> 18:44.146
* Buried on Sunday

18:44.190 --> 18:46.818
* Married on Wednesday

18:46.850 --> 18:49.512
* Buried on Thursday

18:49.560 --> 18:52.324
* Sickened on Friday

18:52.360 --> 18:55.329
* Died on Saturday

18:55.360 --> 18:58.227
* Buried on Sunday

19:02.740 --> 19:04.867
BILLY: (laughs)

19:04.910 --> 19:06.537
If looks could burn,

19:06.570 --> 19:09.835
I do believe that house
would be on fire.

19:09.880 --> 19:12.542
My father always said stay away
from the big houses.

19:12.580 --> 19:13.877
The bigger the house,

19:13.920 --> 19:15.876
the smaller the hearts
that live in it.

19:15.920 --> 19:19.640
You ever been
in the Sibley house?

19:19.690 --> 19:21.954
Smart man, your daddy.

19:21.990 --> 19:24.356
Know what mine taught me?

19:24.390 --> 19:27.359
Never miss an opportunity
to keep your mouth shut.

19:29.860 --> 19:31.191
Let's go.

19:31.230 --> 19:33.698
MAN:
Very good. Very good.

19:33.740 --> 19:35.367
(indistinct talking)

19:44.110 --> 19:46.340
(sinister music plays)

20:04.370 --> 20:07.339
(thinking) Let my
red knock open this lock.

20:07.370 --> 20:10.533
Let this blood key
set me free.

20:10.570 --> 20:12.106
(rumbling)

20:21.650 --> 20:26.440
Stop. Let me out of here!
Please, let me out of here!

20:26.490 --> 20:28.310
Mary?

20:32.830 --> 20:35.253
(breathing heavily)

20:35.300 --> 20:36.927
What have you done to her?!

20:36.960 --> 20:40.430
'Tis what she's doing to herself
you should wonder at.

20:42.300 --> 20:44.530
Forgive me, I...

20:44.570 --> 20:47.607
...have revealed
your true weakness.

20:49.910 --> 20:52.378
I am astounded
at the power

20:52.410 --> 20:55.573
this pale twig has
over all of you.

20:58.350 --> 21:00.489
Do you love her?

21:00.520 --> 21:03.887
Ahh...

21:03.930 --> 21:06.251
I see you do.

21:08.430 --> 21:10.318
Be careful.

21:14.800 --> 21:16.165
Have you seen it
for yourself?

21:16.200 --> 21:18.304
I was told_
not to open It.

21:18.340 --> 21:20.570
And you always do
as you are told?

21:20.610 --> 21:22.134
Rarely.

21:22.180 --> 21:25.570
But when it is Him telling,
I do my best.

21:25.610 --> 21:27.874
Take a look.

21:31.490 --> 21:33.458
Know what it is?

21:33.490 --> 21:35.754
I know what it can do.

21:35.790 --> 21:39.453
Your alchemists
call it Red Mercury.

21:39.490 --> 21:42.823
We call it Angel's Tears,

21:42.860 --> 21:45.090
for the pain it causes us
to make it

21:45.130 --> 21:48.691
and the remorse we felt
when we had to use it.

21:48.740 --> 21:53.165
When we were sent to slaughter
the Canaanites, we wept.

21:53.210 --> 21:56.532
When we delivered the plagues,
we wept.

21:56.580 --> 21:58.377
But beware.

21:58.410 --> 22:01.516
For Samael, that boy,

22:01.550 --> 22:06.783
when he killed every firstborn
of every mother in Egypt,

22:06.820 --> 22:11.029
his eyes were as dry
as the desert.

22:11.060 --> 22:15.292
Keep your feelings
to yourself,

22:15.330 --> 22:17.890
and attend_ to
your next deIIvery.

22:20.500 --> 22:22.968
And...

22:23.000 --> 22:24.729
and Mary?

22:24.770 --> 22:26.704
The Mary you have known,

22:26.740 --> 22:28.605
you'll never see again.

22:36.720 --> 22:39.587
Still awake in there,
I hope.

22:42.520 --> 22:43.521
(loud knock)

22:43.560 --> 22:45.152
(moans)

22:45.190 --> 22:48.159
(distorted voice) All our
true fun has yet to begin.

22:48.200 --> 22:50.691
No. No!

22:50.730 --> 22:52.527
(clanging)

22:59.540 --> 23:01.337
...think my favorite
is the one

23:01.380 --> 23:02.836
about how you faced down
that wolf pack up in
the White Mountains.

23:02.880 --> 23:04.507
Wolf pack?

23:04.550 --> 23:06.370
There was only one.

23:06.410 --> 23:08.514
He was weaker and hungrier
than me.

23:08.550 --> 23:10.711
No, I remember it well.

23:10.750 --> 23:12.183
* Alden swung it
off his back *

23:12.220 --> 23:14.051
* But as he slew
the mIghty beast *

23:14.090 --> 23:16.615
* Three more leapt from out
the night to rend his flesh *

23:16.660 --> 23:18.719
* And on it feast

23:18.760 --> 23:20.728
What the hell is that?

23:20.760 --> 23:24.366
The Ballad of
Captain John Alden.

23:24.400 --> 23:25.958
A ballad?

23:28.940 --> 23:30.908
About me?

23:30.940 --> 23:34.376
Sure. In the northland
you're a regular hero --

23:34.410 --> 23:39.541
like Pilgrim or Cromwell
or Robin Hood.

23:39.580 --> 23:43.619
If it smells like bullshit,
it is bullshit.

23:43.650 --> 23:46.687
And if it don't, it's bullshit
wearing French perfume.

23:50.160 --> 23:52.685
BILLY: What about
all the other stories?

23:55.130 --> 23:56.722
When you've tasted war,

23:56.760 --> 23:59.866
you'll know the difference
between battles and ballads.

24:05.840 --> 24:07.569
Slow down.

24:07.610 --> 24:09.931
Oh, so not only aren't you
half the man the ballads say,

24:09.980 --> 24:11.902
you're old and slow.

24:11.950 --> 24:13.440
Hey.

24:13.480 --> 24:16.142
Animals are better hunters
and trackers than we are.

24:16.180 --> 24:17.511
And you know why?

24:17.550 --> 24:20.951
Because they know
how to stop.

24:20.990 --> 24:23.754
You ever see a hawk hover
5b” In the sky?

24:23.790 --> 24:25.781
Or a wolf pause
to catch a scent?

24:25.830 --> 24:28.424
You are trampling
more signs

24:28.460 --> 24:32.794
than you can see by thundering
ahead like a blind bear.

24:40.210 --> 24:42.132
(indistinct talking)

24:44.980 --> 24:48.677
We must find a way
to help these poor refugees.

24:48.720 --> 24:50.347
Why?

24:50.380 --> 24:55.283
They will all die anyway in your
master's infernal plan.

24:55.320 --> 24:58.289
We are not yet certain
what will happen.

24:58.330 --> 25:00.218
I still hope --

25:00.260 --> 25:01.659
Again, hope.

25:01.700 --> 25:04.567
You are so filled with it.

25:04.600 --> 25:08.661
They should have named you Hope
instead of Anne.

25:08.700 --> 25:12.739
Perhaps if we have
a girl child, then we will.

25:12.770 --> 25:15.307
Herbs! Fresh herbs!

25:15.340 --> 25:17.069
Cotton.

25:17.110 --> 25:19.999
I have just spoken with
the Baron Von Marburg.

25:20.050 --> 25:22.518
He has made clear to me
the po|Icy he WIshes --

25:22.550 --> 25:26.042
that we remain open to those
desperate arrivals --

25:26.090 --> 25:29.184
and he and the Sibley fortune
will back it.

25:29.220 --> 25:32.678
But now, with
this latest atrocity,

25:32.730 --> 25:35.551
the temperament among the people
is running very high.

25:35.600 --> 25:40.025
I fear they may demand swift
and harsh measures.

25:40.070 --> 25:43.164
There _is even talk about
gatherIng an armed mob

25:43.200 --> 25:45.532
to drive the refugees
back into the forest.

25:45.570 --> 25:46.867
Why, they wouldn't!

25:46.910 --> 25:49.401
I need you,
at the inn tonight,

25:49.440 --> 25:51.044
to discuss the matter
with the Selectmen.

25:51.080 --> 25:53.002
-At the inn?
-The inn? Absolutely not.

25:53.050 --> 25:55.268
And why ever not, Madame?

25:55.320 --> 25:58.118
The best hope that we can offer
these poor people

25:58.150 --> 26:01.278
is to stop them from being
driven out of town to starve.

26:01.320 --> 26:02.787
Pleading their case,

26:02.820 --> 26:05.323
I would merely be doing
exactly what you wanted.

26:08.900 --> 26:10.765
Very well, husband.

26:17.670 --> 26:19.638
(chuckles)

26:19.670 --> 26:21.228
I must say, Mather,

26:21.280 --> 26:27.298
I could never allow a woman
to control me |Ike that.

26:27.350 --> 26:30.740
You're gathering
the Selectmen at Lamb's?

26:30.790 --> 26:33.611
I was hoping a few drinks
might calm them,

26:33.660 --> 26:38.552
leave them more susceptible
to your persuasion.

26:38.590 --> 26:40.990
That should do the trick.

26:53.710 --> 26:56.304
Bear's breech,
columbine, henbane,

26:56.340 --> 26:58.171
hyacinth, larkspur, mandrake,

26:58.210 --> 26:59.802
mugwort, and nettle.
Please.

27:02.820 --> 27:04.310
(whispering) Quickly!

27:09.790 --> 27:11.655
Reverend Mather.

27:11.690 --> 27:13.749
You're the only one
who can help me.

27:13.800 --> 27:17.258
You're the only one knows
the truth about witches.

27:17.300 --> 27:19.188
Let us have no talk
of witches, Isaac.

27:19.230 --> 27:21.266
But, sir, I am certain
that Mercy --

27:21.300 --> 27:23.165
Listen and believe me
when I tell you --

27:23.200 --> 27:25.259
stay away from witches.

27:25.310 --> 27:27.335
At all costs.

28:04.180 --> 28:05.545
-(shrieks)
-(gasps)

28:06.780 --> 28:09.078
I did not summon you, Hag,

28:09.120 --> 28:11.042
and you will not ride
your own mistress.

28:11.090 --> 28:12.489
Now begone!

28:12.520 --> 28:14.511
(groans)

28:52.830 --> 28:54.297
There is nothing
to be done here.

28:54.330 --> 28:56.491
But...we gotta bury them.

28:58.470 --> 29:00.768
There's nothing to bury here.

29:00.800 --> 29:02.791
But, we can't --
(horse neighs)

29:02.840 --> 29:04.967
(men speaking French)

29:08.180 --> 29:09.602
Hide.

29:11.410 --> 29:13.401
(speaking in French continues)

29:31.470 --> 29:33.165
(snarls)

29:41.210 --> 29:42.768
(horse snorts)

29:55.520 --> 29:57.511
Et Voila.

29:59.460 --> 30:02.190
On pourrait

30:02.230 --> 30:05.688
dtruire tout un monde avec
assez de cela.

30:05.730 --> 30:10.531
Quel monde voulez-vous
que nous dtruire prochaine?

30:10.570 --> 30:12.868
Salem, bien sur.

30:12.910 --> 30:15.037
Mais pas encore.

30:15.080 --> 30:16.809
(speaks French)

30:39.670 --> 30:42.059
(insects chirping)

30:42.100 --> 30:45.035
(indistinct conversations)

30:49.340 --> 30:50.477
(man laughs)

30:50.510 --> 30:52.205
WOMAN: Oh, yes.

30:52.250 --> 30:54.741
MAN: You tart!

30:54.780 --> 30:55.917
(laughs)

30:55.950 --> 30:57.577
MAN #2: Gimme that!

30:57.620 --> 30:59.349
Help, please!

30:59.390 --> 31:02.314
Stop! Stop!

31:02.360 --> 31:03.850
Stop!

31:10.530 --> 31:12.862
Isaac the Fornicator.

31:15.400 --> 31:17.493
The Truth Teller.

31:17.540 --> 31:19.838
Magistrate named it so.

31:19.870 --> 31:22.077
Just like he named me
Night Watch.

31:22.110 --> 31:26.945
Heard you been asking questions
about Mercy Lewis.

31:26.980 --> 31:28.743
What if I have?

31:30.480 --> 31:34.382
If you like your tongue,
never say that name again.

31:34.420 --> 31:36.149
(grunting)

31:49.440 --> 31:52.204
There ain't no Mercy Lewis.

31:52.240 --> 31:53.935
Get it?

31:59.010 --> 32:00.978
Fornicator.

32:09.460 --> 32:11.621
There was nothing
left alive.

32:11.660 --> 32:14.891
Not even a blade of grass.
Just dust and death.

32:14.930 --> 32:16.989
Yes.

32:17.030 --> 32:19.760
What a lovely thought.

32:22.370 --> 32:25.567
The French only await
my word to strike here next.

32:25.610 --> 32:28.579
The French have done
their job.

32:28.610 --> 32:30.669
Filled our pot
with frightened meat.

32:30.710 --> 32:33.144
SENTINEL: And when Salem
is obliterated,

32:33.180 --> 32:34.909
they will take the blame.

32:34.950 --> 32:37.009
This will be the spark
that ignites a war

32:37.050 --> 32:39.143
that shall not cease
for a hundred years.

32:39.190 --> 32:41.954
_ All this
just to start a war?

32:41.990 --> 32:46.279
Not just any war --
total war.

32:46.330 --> 32:48.696
Give a man
enough blood-thirst,

32:48.730 --> 32:52.860
and he will kill God by
the simple device of unbelief.

32:52.900 --> 32:56.290
_I can see
somethIng concerns you.

32:59.040 --> 33:01.201
What shall become of Mary?

33:01.240 --> 33:03.105
Nothing.

33:03.140 --> 33:05.040
And everything.

33:05.080 --> 33:08.516
Her reckoning.

33:10.050 --> 33:12.189
I should be present
at this reckoning.

33:12.220 --> 33:13.448
No.

33:13.490 --> 33:15.617
Your sister will witness.

33:15.660 --> 33:17.184
A reminder of the vital need

33:17.220 --> 33:19.859
to keep a very tight leash
on her pet Puritan.

33:19.890 --> 33:21.050
But I --

33:21.100 --> 33:23.352
I may not command
your heart,

33:23.400 --> 33:26.221
but I will command
your loyalty.

33:28.340 --> 33:31.059
The good men of Salem debate
their future.

33:31.110 --> 33:34.409
You must help Mr. Hathorne
squash any change.

33:34.440 --> 33:37.136
Does Hathorne know
what we do?

33:37.180 --> 33:39.546
Hathorne knows
only one thIng --

33:39.580 --> 33:44.449
which side of the bread
his butter is on.

33:45.950 --> 33:47.588
_MAN:
We are Ill-prepared --

33:47.620 --> 33:50.214
What would you have me do,
cast them out?

33:50.260 --> 33:52.148
(men clamoring)

33:52.190 --> 33:56.559
Send women and children
from the safety of our town

33:56.600 --> 34:00.764
to be torn apart in the woods
by beasts,

34:00.800 --> 34:03.598
scalped by Indians,

34:03.640 --> 34:06.006
and slaughtered
by the French?

34:06.040 --> 34:10.932
If our lives
and our |Ive|Ihoods,

34:10.980 --> 34:14.609
which in truth are the same
thing, depend on it --

34:14.650 --> 34:16.709
then yes.

34:16.750 --> 34:18.411
(men shout agreement)

34:18.450 --> 34:21.556
Salem's coffers empty
while the town fills

34:21.590 --> 34:25.128
with this human
flotsam and jetsam!

34:25.160 --> 34:28.049
(indistinct murmuring
and shouting)

34:30.830 --> 34:33.628
Gentlemen!
Gentlemen, please.

34:33.670 --> 34:35.194
Please.

34:35.240 --> 34:37.936
Let me remind you that
the combined wealth

34:37.970 --> 34:41.701
of the Sibleys, the Marburgs,
the Mathers,

34:41.740 --> 34:44.538
and the Hales all
stand behind Salem

34:44.580 --> 34:46.707
as long as Salem
does the right thing.

34:46.750 --> 34:48.718
TREASURER PUTNAM:
The right thing for who?

34:48.750 --> 34:50.718
What is it you really want,
Marburg?

34:50.750 --> 34:53.139
I want what we all want.

34:53.190 --> 34:56.114
For Salem to be what your
founders intended it to be --

34:56.160 --> 34:57.650
the new Jerusalem.

34:57.690 --> 35:00.989
Not the new Sodom,
which as I recall,

35:01.030 --> 35:04.488
was destroyed by God for
its treatment of strangers.

35:04.530 --> 35:07.624
Is that not correct,
Reverend Mather?

35:07.670 --> 35:10.332
Quite so.

35:10.370 --> 35:14.978
Very easy for such
as yourself, Baron,

35:15.010 --> 35:18.639
to be so
generously minded.

35:18.680 --> 35:20.170
But who will protect
the rest of us?

35:20.210 --> 35:21.643
(men shout agreement)

35:21.680 --> 35:26.481
Who will protect our wives
and our daughters...

35:26.520 --> 35:28.659
(shouting continues)

35:28.690 --> 35:30.988
(room quiets)

35:31.020 --> 35:33.124
(gurgling and rumbling)

35:39.400 --> 35:41.868
(gurgling and rumbling
conﬁnue)

35:41.900 --> 35:44.835
Good Mr. Putnam...

35:47.070 --> 35:50.608
...do you not know...

35:50.640 --> 35:54.371
we are all strangers.

35:54.420 --> 35:57.378
All of us.

35:57.420 --> 36:01.959
Refugees fleeing
a lost Eden

36:01.990 --> 36:06.484
and washed up
on an alien shore.

36:08.030 --> 36:10.157
You are quite right
that the world is filled

36:10.200 --> 36:11.622
with the most terrible dangers.

36:11.670 --> 36:14.833
So how is it that man
has surVIved

36:14.870 --> 36:16.997
in this terrible world?

36:20.610 --> 36:22.339
Love.

36:22.380 --> 36:25.679
God's love.

36:25.710 --> 36:29.714
And God does not grant us love
so that we may love Him alone.

36:29.750 --> 36:32.344
No. It's so that
we may love each other!

36:32.390 --> 36:37.987
Empires vaster and -- and
greater than ours have fallen.

36:38.020 --> 36:39.726
(stomach rumbles)

36:41.530 --> 36:43.327
Fallen more times than I...

36:43.360 --> 36:45.089
(chuckling)
emptied a glass tonight.

36:45.130 --> 36:47.394
(light laughter)

36:47.430 --> 36:50.729
Fallen because God's love
was WIthdrawn.

36:53.540 --> 36:56.373
Do not, in your haste
to make yourselves safe,

36:56.410 --> 36:59.174
commit the very act
that will so offend God

36:59.210 --> 37:00.746
that He withdraws His love

37:00.780 --> 37:03.943
and unleashes
a terrible wrath!

37:06.820 --> 37:12.087
HATHORNE: In the light of such
charitable and fluid wisdom,

37:12.130 --> 37:15.588
I believe it is beneath
the assembly

37:15.630 --> 37:17.757
to even call for a vote.

37:21.230 --> 37:24.734
(gurgling and rumbling)

37:24.770 --> 37:27.034
Are you quite all right?

37:27.070 --> 37:30.039
Simply -- simply too long
since I've indulged.

37:30.080 --> 37:31.707
Forgive me.

37:31.750 --> 37:36.039
I must, um, take refuge
of my own between my sheets.

37:36.080 --> 37:37.172
(grunts)

37:44.460 --> 37:46.348
(vomits)

37:55.040 --> 37:56.439
(vomiting)

38:03.340 --> 38:05.604
(gagging and thudding)

38:11.790 --> 38:13.439
(rat squeaking)

38:25.830 --> 38:28.025
(squeaking continues)

38:28.070 --> 38:29.560
(grunting)

38:36.580 --> 38:38.502
(yells)

38:38.550 --> 38:40.245
(squeaking stops)

38:43.320 --> 38:45.345
(laughs triumphantly)

39:12.380 --> 39:14.541
ISAAC: You.

39:14.580 --> 39:16.912
What are you
still doing here?

39:18.620 --> 39:22.181
I don't need charity!

39:29.900 --> 39:32.027
(crying)

39:38.070 --> 39:41.608
You saved my life.

39:41.640 --> 39:44.973
Was that charity?

39:47.650 --> 39:50.574
I just wanted to stop

39:50.620 --> 39:52.781
anyone else
from getting hurt.

39:52.820 --> 39:54.344
I know.

39:54.390 --> 39:56.381
You will.

39:58.660 --> 40:01.128
Will I?

40:01.160 --> 40:05.722
You think anyone wants help
from "Isaac the Fornicator?"

40:14.440 --> 40:16.806
"F."

40:16.840 --> 40:18.307
For Fearless.

40:43.300 --> 40:45.165
(light creak)

40:59.450 --> 41:01.589
Well, Mother...

41:01.620 --> 41:04.919
are you ready
for your reckoning?

41:04.960 --> 41:07.588
I will not beg
for my life.

41:07.630 --> 41:09.120
Not from you.

41:09.160 --> 41:11.355
Go on. Kill me.

41:11.400 --> 41:13.368
(scoffs)
Do me the favor.

41:13.400 --> 41:17.336
So that I might never again see
the atrocity I gave birth to.

41:17.370 --> 41:20.339
Ki|| you?

41:20.370 --> 41:22.804
Never, Mother dearest.

41:22.840 --> 41:24.137
Neven

41:24.180 --> 41:25.374
SENTINEL:
We will take something

41:25.410 --> 41:27.048
more precious to you
than your life.

41:27.080 --> 41:29.947
Something you have entirely
forgotten how to live without.

41:29.980 --> 41:31.845
Something you came to
think of as your own --

41:31.890 --> 41:33.118
nay -- was -- you.

41:33.150 --> 41:35.152
But it was never yours.

41:35.190 --> 41:38.648
Only lent to you
by your betters.

41:38.690 --> 41:41.158
I know what you are.

41:41.190 --> 41:42.794
You're nothing.

41:42.830 --> 41:45.298
Nothing
but common thieves,

41:45.330 --> 41:49.391
liars, traitors,
rapists, murderers.

41:49.440 --> 41:53.831
But worse than that,
you're cry babies.

41:53.870 --> 41:58.569
Poor, proud, pitiful things.

41:58.610 --> 42:00.805
I've seen you --

42:00.850 --> 42:02.738
and the best and worst
men can be.

42:02.780 --> 42:04.077
And I assure you --

42:04.120 --> 42:06.543
even the lowest of human
has more heart,

42:06.590 --> 42:08.581
more soul than you two.

42:10.060 --> 42:12.984
Take what you will.
I want nothing of you or yours.

42:13.030 --> 42:14.759
Get your hands off me!

42:26.310 --> 42:30.701
I see you don't even remember
who you were.

42:30.740 --> 42:32.503
What you were...

42:32.550 --> 42:34.279
when I first came to you.

42:34.310 --> 42:37.609
In the depth of your need,
you called upon me,

42:37.650 --> 42:39.208
and I gave you power.

42:39.250 --> 42:43.118
The power to survive
this world of shit God gave you.

42:43.160 --> 42:45.583
You cannot.

42:45.630 --> 42:48.599
I gave you my soul.
We have a contract.

42:48.630 --> 42:50.848
Had a contract.

42:50.900 --> 42:56.532
I now declare that contract
null and void.

42:56.570 --> 43:01.269
Here, now, and forever.

43:01.310 --> 43:04.404
Aaah!

43:04.440 --> 43:08.001
(moaning)

43:11.350 --> 43:15.650
And now I take from you
every power I gave.

43:15.690 --> 43:19.854
I take from you
the power of Earth.

43:45.050 --> 43:47.280
(gasping)

43:55.160 --> 43:57.151
No, you little bastard.

43:57.200 --> 43:58.224
Leave me my breath --

44:17.980 --> 44:23.054
Now give up
your waters, woman.

44:42.610 --> 44:46.842
Earth, air, water.

44:46.880 --> 44:51.249
That leaves but one precious
elemental power.

44:51.280 --> 44:53.544
No. That is mine.

44:53.590 --> 44:57.686
That fire is mine, and it was
there long before I --

45:18.480 --> 45:22.974
I have killed the elemental
powers WIthIn you.

45:24.150 --> 45:29.053
I have killed the witch in you
and left nothing.

45:29.090 --> 45:31.854
Nothing but a woman.

45:31.890 --> 45:33.881
Weep, woman. Weep.

45:33.930 --> 45:37.388
The tears are all
we have left you.

45:37.430 --> 45:40.888
(rat squeaking)

45:56.950 --> 45:59.510
(gasping)
