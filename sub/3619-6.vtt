WEBVTT

00:07.833 --> 00:09.096
Ooh.

00:09.270 --> 00:11.446
Any idea what this
meeting's all about?

00:11.620 --> 00:14.405
Oh, probably something
to do with the kids.

00:14.579 --> 00:16.233
Why? Did
something happen?

00:16.407 --> 00:18.453
Oh, I'm sure
they've gotten kidnapped

00:18.627 --> 00:20.107
by the latest demon
or something.

00:20.281 --> 00:22.805
Paige, that is so not funny.

00:22.979 --> 00:25.416
You get so emotional
when you're PMS.

00:25.590 --> 00:27.288
Yeah, and you get mean.

00:27.462 --> 00:28.680
I do not get mean!

00:28.854 --> 00:30.073
I'm above it all.

00:30.247 --> 00:31.640
Nothing happens to me.

00:31.814 --> 00:32.858
All righty then.

00:33.033 --> 00:34.077
[gasps]

00:34.251 --> 00:35.513
[groans]

00:35.687 --> 00:37.254
Oh. Right, nothing
happens to you.

00:37.428 --> 00:38.690
You're above it all.

00:38.864 --> 00:40.562
Fine. So I get a little jumpy.

00:40.736 --> 00:42.520
And I get a little pissy,
so watch it.

00:42.694 --> 00:43.478
BOTH:
We know.

00:43.652 --> 00:44.914
The good news is,

00:45.088 --> 00:46.568
we all get over it
at the same time.

00:46.742 --> 00:48.700
As long as we don't
kill each other in the process,

00:48.874 --> 00:51.007
which brings me
to what we need to talk about.

00:51.181 --> 00:52.530
Oh, that sounds serious.

00:52.704 --> 00:55.533
That calls for ice cream
with three spoons.

00:57.144 --> 00:58.928
Ah, ah, ah.
Personal gain.

00:59.102 --> 01:01.017
I know, but screw it.

01:01.191 --> 01:03.280
It's too good.

01:03.454 --> 01:05.587
PIPER:
Anyway, I've been wanting to
tell you guys something

01:05.761 --> 01:07.850
for a while, um...

01:08.024 --> 01:09.939
I just didn't know
how to say it.

01:10.113 --> 01:11.549
Oh, my God,
are you pregnant again?

01:11.723 --> 01:12.724
[groans]

01:12.898 --> 01:14.596
No. This is not

01:14.770 --> 01:16.293
a good thing.

01:16.467 --> 01:19.253
Do you guys remember
Zola, the Elder who disappeared?

01:19.427 --> 01:20.471
Yeah.

01:20.645 --> 01:21.951
Well, he didn't
disappear.

01:22.125 --> 01:23.605
He was killed.

01:23.779 --> 01:24.910
Leo killed him.

01:25.085 --> 01:26.738
Leo killed him?

01:26.912 --> 01:27.739
Aah!

01:27.913 --> 01:29.437
It-It was an accident.

01:29.611 --> 01:30.786
He didn't mean to.

01:30.960 --> 01:32.222
I mean, he was tricked.

01:32.396 --> 01:34.572
You might want
to tell that to Zola.

01:34.746 --> 01:36.748
[screaming,
glass tinkling]

01:37.619 --> 01:39.099
[sizzling]

01:39.273 --> 01:40.317
[gasps]

01:46.454 --> 01:47.629
Hey, hey, what was that?

01:47.803 --> 01:49.718
I was angry.

01:49.892 --> 01:51.415
PAIGE:
Uh, yeah, but

01:51.589 --> 01:53.591
you blew it up
without even looking at it.

01:53.765 --> 01:55.767
Well, our emotions are tied
to our powers,

01:55.941 --> 01:57.552
so, apparently,
I'm feeling a little weird.

01:57.726 --> 01:59.249
Okay, but...

01:59.423 --> 02:01.208
I was just looking
for a little understanding.

02:01.382 --> 02:02.557
That's all.

02:02.731 --> 02:03.949
I know. We're sorry.

02:04.124 --> 02:05.734
It's just, we're
not big fans

02:05.908 --> 02:07.388
of the Elders right now.

02:07.562 --> 02:09.477
PAIGE:
I mean, plus, it's not
like Leo could really

02:09.651 --> 02:10.826
hurt anybody anyway--
we don't believe

02:11.000 --> 02:12.523
that he could
actually do that.

02:12.697 --> 02:14.003
Well, unfortunately,
the Elders don't think that way.

02:14.177 --> 02:16.223
And if they can prove
that he did do it,

02:16.397 --> 02:18.138
they won't think
he did it by accident.

02:20.575 --> 02:22.577
Sorry to interrupt,
but I have to tell you something

02:22.751 --> 02:23.882
that you're probably
not gonna like.

02:24.056 --> 02:25.449
Did you kill anybody else?

02:27.277 --> 02:29.323
I'm sorry.
You told them?!

02:29.497 --> 02:31.455
Well, I had to.
It effects them, too.

02:31.629 --> 02:32.543
More than you know.

02:32.717 --> 02:33.892
They want to
assign you

02:34.066 --> 02:35.459
a new whitelighter
because of it.

02:35.633 --> 02:37.113
What?!
They're getting
more suspicious

02:37.287 --> 02:38.636
about what happened.

02:38.810 --> 02:39.768
They want to make sure
you're protected.

02:39.942 --> 02:42.423
Protected from what? You?

02:42.597 --> 02:43.946
They're out of their minds.

02:44.120 --> 02:45.295
Still, he's gonna
be sent here tomorrow.

02:45.469 --> 02:46.818
Well, I hope
I don't blow him up.

02:46.992 --> 02:49.734
Piper, you can't blow up
a whitelighter.

02:49.908 --> 02:52.302
Why not? She blows
you up all the time.

02:52.476 --> 02:54.043
PIPER:
Look, we have enough people
orbing in and out

02:54.217 --> 02:56.132
of here on a daily basis,
and we don't need another.

02:56.306 --> 02:57.916
[explosive pop and sizzling]

02:58.090 --> 03:00.745
Got it.

03:00.919 --> 03:04.445
That was a great toaster.

03:18.589 --> 03:20.678
You know,
you probably

03:20.852 --> 03:22.550
shouldn't be doing that
out in the open?

03:22.724 --> 03:25.030
Oh, please. Nobody's here.
It's midnight.

03:25.205 --> 03:26.815
Besides...[clears throat]

03:26.989 --> 03:28.904
I would have sensed
if anybody was coming.

03:29.078 --> 03:30.558
You didn't sense me.

03:30.732 --> 03:33.517
You're an Elder,
or at least you used to be.

03:33.691 --> 03:35.650
You know, I'm just
here to tell you that

03:35.824 --> 03:38.479
maybe you don't want to go by
the sisters' house tomorrow.

03:38.653 --> 03:39.828
Just a friendly warning.

03:40.002 --> 03:41.743
Oh, yeah?

03:41.917 --> 03:44.528
Did you warn Zola, too, before
something happened to him?

03:44.702 --> 03:46.443
You see, the word's out, Leo.

03:46.617 --> 03:48.924
Nobody knows which side
you're on anymore,

03:49.098 --> 03:50.534
which is precisely why

03:50.708 --> 03:52.014
I amgoing
to the sisters' tomorrow.

03:52.188 --> 03:54.538
It's a dream job
for any whitelighter.

03:54.712 --> 03:56.236
Now if you'll excuse me...

03:56.410 --> 03:57.498
[clears throat]

03:57.672 --> 03:59.369
...I need to prepare myself.

Great.

Now not only am I exhausted,
but I'm starving.

Oh, I see you're exhausted,
and you're starving,

06:38.789 --> 06:41.226

you bloated.

Eh! No weeping,
you promised.

06:47.624 --> 06:49.931
Wait, have you guys seen
the new whitelighter yet?

06:50.105 --> 06:51.802
No, Leo. You probably
scared him off.

06:51.976 --> 06:54.109
No, that's the thing--
I didn'tscare him off.

06:54.283 --> 06:55.893
He should have been here by now.

06:56.067 --> 06:58.069
I'll be right back.

06:58.243 --> 06:59.593
Better not be
with that whitelighter.

06:59.767 --> 07:01.333
Did anyone else have
weird dreams last night?

07:01.508 --> 07:02.639
PAIGE:
No. You?

07:02.813 --> 07:04.032
Yeah, and they were

07:04.206 --> 07:05.947
really violent
and, like, painful.

Hey, um, you want
to go somewhere with me?

07:08.123 --> 07:09.341
PHOEBE:
Where?

07:09.516 --> 07:11.648
I have to go over
to Agent Brody's place,

07:11.822 --> 07:14.999
and, uh, try to snoop around,
find out if he's a demon or not.

07:15.173 --> 07:16.523
You think
he's a demon?

07:16.697 --> 07:18.525
No, I don't,
but Piper does.

07:18.699 --> 07:20.396
I don't know what he is,

07:20.570 --> 07:22.659
but more importantly, we need
to find out what he wants.

07:22.833 --> 07:24.574
We have enough to worry
about around here

07:24.748 --> 07:26.228
without having to worry
about him, too,

07:26.402 --> 07:28.099
so can you go
with Miss Jumpy here

07:28.273 --> 07:30.101
and make sure she
doesn't orb out
in front of him

07:30.275 --> 07:32.452
just in case he is a Fed
and nothing else?

07:32.626 --> 07:34.105
I can control myself.I can't go anyway.

I have to go to work.

I thought you weren't going back
in for a couple of days.

07:38.806 --> 07:40.982
I'm not, but that's when
Les leaves, and I just...

07:41.156 --> 07:43.419
I have this feeling that
he's pulling away from me.

07:43.593 --> 07:45.073
Hey, maybe he's
pulling away from you

07:45.247 --> 07:46.727
because he's, uh,
I don't know... leaving?

07:46.901 --> 07:47.641
[chuckles]

07:47.815 --> 07:49.251
That might be true.

07:49.425 --> 07:51.775

just please be careful

07:51.949 --> 07:54.212
around Brody? And we'll
talk about Leo moving in

08:09.401 --> 08:11.795

You don't know?

No, I don't know.

What, you think I did this?We don't know what to think,

08:19.673 --> 08:21.544
except that he was supposed
to report to the Charmed Ones,

08:21.718 --> 08:22.719
and you didn't want him to.

08:22.893 --> 08:23.981
So that makes me guilty?

08:24.155 --> 08:25.156
How do you know

08:25.330 --> 08:26.680
a darklighter didn't do this?

08:26.854 --> 08:28.290
Does it look
like a darklighter did that?

08:28.464 --> 08:30.901
You were the last one
to see him, Leo.

08:31.075 --> 08:32.860
Just like you were
the last one to see Zola.

08:33.034 --> 08:35.297
It wasn't me.

to you for a sec?

What about?

08:54.621 --> 08:56.013
Uh, well, it's about Leo.

08:56.187 --> 08:57.319
You know, moving back in?

08:57.493 --> 08:58.363
Is there a problem?

Well, you know, we love,

08:59.930 --> 09:01.410
loveLeo, but, uh...

09:01.584 --> 09:02.890
But?

09:03.064 --> 09:04.892
Are you sure this is
a good time for this?

09:05.066 --> 09:06.589
I mean, like you said,

09:06.763 --> 09:08.504
it's really crazy,
so much is going on.

And, um...

he does hear voices.

09:13.944 --> 09:15.946
We allhear voices sometimes.

09:17.034 --> 09:18.906
Yeah, we might
hear voices,

09:19.080 --> 09:21.299
but we don't see
little floating heads
going along with them.

09:21.473 --> 09:24.346

be here where he is safe.

the boys?

09:26.174 --> 09:27.479

Well, aren't you afraid
they'll be in danger?

From who, Leo?
That's ridiculous.

09:30.787 --> 09:32.615
No, not from Leo.
Whoever's after Leo.

it through?

my family back.

with our powers lately?

he's never going
to talk to me again.

19:54.671 --> 19:56.499
Got to go.You better be home
before the moon rises.

19:56.673 --> 19:59.763
And stay away from red meat.

20:06.466 --> 20:09.599
I thought you were supposed
to trap them?

20:09.773 --> 20:11.601
They kind of caught us
by surprise, you know.

20:11.775 --> 20:13.386
Did you see what
they look like?
Were they demons?

20:13.560 --> 20:15.388
It was night.

20:15.562 --> 20:17.607
We have to find out
who did this, and vanquish them

20:17.781 --> 20:18.913
before they attack us.

20:19.087 --> 20:20.654
I'm ordering a lockdown

20:20.828 --> 20:22.482
on all whitelighters
until we catch these beasts.

20:22.656 --> 20:25.267
Beasts-- that's a harsh word
don't you think?

20:25.441 --> 20:27.269
At least
you've been exonerated.

20:27.443 --> 20:28.401
I'm, uh...

20:28.575 --> 20:29.793
sorry I doubted you.

20:29.967 --> 20:31.926
So am I.

20:32.100 --> 20:33.493
We have a lot of healing

20:33.667 --> 20:35.582
to do, Leo, I admit.

20:35.756 --> 20:38.280
But forgiveness must prevail
if we're to work together.

20:38.454 --> 20:41.022
Now this new power
that we're sensing,

20:41.196 --> 20:44.243
it is coming closer
and it's more threatening.

20:44.417 --> 20:46.245
Okay, new power,
what new power?

20:46.419 --> 20:47.811
We don't know exactly.

20:47.985 --> 20:50.118
But, if it's responsible
for this attack,

20:50.292 --> 20:52.033
Elders could be next.

20:52.207 --> 20:53.948
Help us, Leo.

20:59.301 --> 21:01.825
Okay, I have to
find Agent Brody.
Why?

21:01.999 --> 21:04.393
Because he-he talked about
that new power thing.

21:04.567 --> 21:06.177
So he must know
something about it.

21:06.352 --> 21:08.832
All right, but be careful.
Watch out for those beasts.

21:09.006 --> 21:10.486
About those beasts.

21:10.660 --> 21:11.792
That would be us.

21:11.966 --> 21:12.923
What are you talking about?

21:13.097 --> 21:14.403
Those funky powers,

21:14.577 --> 21:16.492
the sharp fangs, the claws.

21:16.666 --> 21:19.234
We are the ones who have been
attacking the whitelighters,

21:19.408 --> 21:21.715
something is
transforming us.

21:21.889 --> 21:24.283
It may not be this blue
moon thing after all.

21:25.632 --> 21:27.590
I have to go.

21:39.950 --> 21:41.952
PHOEBE [screaming]:
Leslie!

21:42.126 --> 21:45.434
Hi. I am so sorry.

21:45.608 --> 21:46.957
But I'm here now.

21:47.131 --> 21:48.829
Things got a little wild
back at the house.

21:49.003 --> 21:50.483
Phoebe, it's a
quarter to 10:00.

21:50.657 --> 21:52.485
I know and I would have
called but I-I just...

21:52.659 --> 21:54.965
Leslie, please,
I-I said I was sorry.

21:55.139 --> 21:56.010
Yeah, I know you are.

21:56.184 --> 21:57.185
You always are.

21:57.359 --> 21:58.621
Don't be mad at me.

21:58.795 --> 22:00.754
Come on, I really wanted
to be here, I did.

22:00.928 --> 22:02.799
W-Wait, let me guess.
something came up, right?

22:02.973 --> 22:04.671
Yes, something came up.But you can't tell me
what it is,

22:04.845 --> 22:06.368
just like you never can.Right,

22:06.542 --> 22:07.761
and it's not because I
don't want to, it's just...

22:07.935 --> 22:09.763
It's complicated,
yeah, I-I know.

22:09.937 --> 22:12.548
Would you stop finishing
my sentences, please?

22:12.722 --> 22:14.811
Well, why not?
They all end the same way.

22:18.815 --> 22:23.254
Look, I'm... I'm sorry,
it's just I... I'm frustrated.

22:25.256 --> 22:27.563
I guess I didn't think I was
going to like you this much.

22:29.609 --> 22:31.306
Yeah, I know the feeling.

22:34.962 --> 22:37.356
I got to go to work.

22:37.530 --> 22:39.706
Wouldn't want to be late
on my last day.

22:45.364 --> 22:46.626
[knocking at door]

22:51.848 --> 22:53.459
Paige.

22:53.633 --> 22:56.766
Since when do
you use doors?

22:56.940 --> 22:59.116
Look, I need to talk to you.

22:59.290 --> 23:01.597
Great, don't tell me
I didn't check out.

23:01.771 --> 23:03.294
What? No.

23:03.469 --> 23:04.557
You checked out,
you knew you would.

23:04.731 --> 23:06.559
I'm here because I need
to talk to you

23:06.733 --> 23:08.778
about the whole New Power thing
you were telling me about.

23:08.952 --> 23:10.127
What, did something happen?

23:10.301 --> 23:12.478
I'm not sure,
but let's just say

23:12.652 --> 23:15.263
that you aren't the only one
who's concerned about them.

23:15.437 --> 23:17.091
Well, did you see 'em,
did they attack, what?

23:17.265 --> 23:19.746
Just curious, how do you
even know about themanyway?

23:19.920 --> 23:22.357
That's a, that's a long story.

23:22.531 --> 23:23.706
Why don't you give me
the short version?

23:23.880 --> 23:25.273
Look,

23:25.447 --> 23:27.101
you said you wanted my help,
didn't you?

23:27.275 --> 23:29.233
No, I said that you
would need mine.

23:31.279 --> 23:34.543
Please, will you just
tell me what you know?

23:34.717 --> 23:36.240
I just know they're coming.

23:36.415 --> 23:38.373
That's why I'm here.

23:38.547 --> 23:40.201
I-I don't know,
everything seemed to fit

23:40.375 --> 23:42.159
a-a certain pattern.

23:42.333 --> 23:44.466
Pattern, what pattern?

23:44.640 --> 23:46.686
[sighs]

23:46.860 --> 23:49.689
All I know is that they
come from ancient times.

23:49.863 --> 23:50.994
When they were in power,

23:52.648 --> 23:54.302
I'm not sure why,
but something happened

23:54.476 --> 23:56.043
and then they went away, and now
they're trying to come back.

23:56.217 --> 23:58.611
They've been trying to
come back for some time.

23:58.785 --> 24:03.529
And to do that, they need power.

24:03.703 --> 24:05.792
And that's the pattern.

24:05.966 --> 24:07.924
I mean, they're always after it.

24:08.098 --> 24:09.099
It won't be long

24:09.273 --> 24:10.753
before they come
after yours.

24:10.927 --> 24:13.452
I think they may have
already tried.

24:14.496 --> 24:16.803
You can't let them.

24:16.977 --> 24:19.066
Paige, you got to do everything
that you can to stop them.

24:19.240 --> 24:20.154
Otherwise...

24:20.328 --> 24:21.285
Otherwise what?

24:21.460 --> 24:23.244
They're going to kill you.

24:24.767 --> 24:26.769
Just like they
killed my parents.

24:35.735 --> 24:40.174
I was, uh...
five when it happened.

24:42.916 --> 24:46.876
No one knew who did it.

24:47.050 --> 24:49.400
That's why I became a cop--
to find out.

24:51.446 --> 24:53.579
I never would have imagined
that it would have

24:53.753 --> 24:57.800
brought me to here, but it has.

24:57.974 --> 25:01.674
I am not leaving this city
until I prove it.

25:17.864 --> 25:20.562
You're certain
he's the most powerful?

25:20.736 --> 25:21.607
He's their leader.

25:21.781 --> 25:22.738
Wastheir leader.

25:27.874 --> 25:29.919
You're not going anywhere.

25:30.093 --> 25:31.181
Why are you doing this?

25:31.355 --> 25:32.748
Who are you?

25:32.922 --> 25:34.489
I still think
a direct approach is best.

25:34.663 --> 25:36.491
We tried that,
it's not working.

25:36.665 --> 25:39.625
Leo's being drawn back
to his family, back to Good.

25:39.799 --> 25:42.758
But he's not there yet.

25:42.932 --> 25:44.804
We must drive him away,

25:44.978 --> 25:49.373
make them afraid of him
if we're to succeed.

25:51.332 --> 25:55.205
And you're going to
help us do exactly that.

25:57.251 --> 25:58.600
[cracks neck]

26:02.604 --> 26:03.866
PIPER:
This one should work

26:04.040 --> 26:05.389
if the beasts are
just possessing us.

26:05.564 --> 26:06.956
This one should work
if the last one doesn't.

26:07.130 --> 26:09.002
It should knock out
about ten of 'em.

26:09.176 --> 26:10.917
This one, well, this one--

26:11.091 --> 26:14.311
only use if you really,
really have to.

26:14.485 --> 26:15.748
Why, what is it?

26:15.922 --> 26:18.185
A little bit of everything,
just in case.

26:18.359 --> 26:20.622
Piper, I'm not
using these on you.

26:20.796 --> 26:22.102
You might have to.

26:22.276 --> 26:24.017
Look, it's the last night
of a blue moon.

26:24.191 --> 26:26.497
All we have to do is
wait until it passes.

26:26.672 --> 26:28.761
Unless it's not the blue moon
that's doing this to us.

26:28.935 --> 26:29.892
Now Paige said that...

26:30.066 --> 26:31.720
The New Power.
I know.

26:31.894 --> 26:33.722
If it's only after power, why
would it be doing all this?

26:33.896 --> 26:34.767
It doesn't
make any sense.

26:34.941 --> 26:36.072
Better safe than sorry.

26:36.246 --> 26:37.291
Now, Paige and Phoebe
are coming home

26:37.465 --> 26:38.640
in a couple of minutes,

26:38.814 --> 26:40.163
we need to get
the cage ready.

26:40.337 --> 26:42.035
Piper, I know you're scared.

26:42.209 --> 26:43.514
I'm not scared.

26:43.689 --> 26:45.125
I'm worried we're
going to kill somebody.

26:45.299 --> 26:46.343
You're not going
to kill anybody.

26:46.517 --> 26:47.518
I promise.

26:48.998 --> 26:51.392
Look, you already saved me,
now let me save you,

26:51.566 --> 26:55.091
and then maybe... it'll be time
for me to move back in again.

26:56.092 --> 26:57.398
It already is.

26:58.660 --> 27:01.141
Grab those.

27:09.279 --> 27:12.935
Who are you?
Actually, I'm
about to be you.

27:14.023 --> 27:15.329
PIPER:
Are you coming?

27:15.503 --> 27:16.591
I'll be right there.

27:16.765 --> 27:18.941
[cracks neck]

27:22.075 --> 27:24.773
Do you think we should put
some snacks in the cage?

27:24.947 --> 27:26.296
Like what, a wildebeest?

27:26.470 --> 27:27.254
Please don't say "beast."

27:27.428 --> 27:28.777
No, I'm just saying

27:28.951 --> 27:31.040
we don't know how long
we're going to be in here.

27:31.214 --> 27:32.781
What if I get hungry?

27:32.955 --> 27:34.348
Well, then, we'll have Leo
throw us a whitelighter.

27:34.522 --> 27:35.610
Don't worry about it.

27:35.784 --> 27:38.482
Well, I doworry about it.

27:38.657 --> 27:41.268
I just don't like
not knowing what's going on.

27:41.442 --> 27:43.226
Leo thinks it's the
blue moon for sure,

27:43.400 --> 27:45.489
so what we have to do
is make it until morning

27:45.664 --> 27:47.753
without eating anyone
and we'll be fine.

27:47.927 --> 27:49.624
What if Leo's wrong?

27:49.798 --> 27:51.452
You know, I mean, it's not
like he's been himself lately.

27:51.626 --> 27:52.627
We've been
through this.

27:52.801 --> 27:54.281
No we haven't,
not enough.

27:54.455 --> 27:56.022
Look, you guys.

27:56.196 --> 27:58.198
Trust me, we don't have to
worry about him anymore.

27:58.372 --> 27:59.982
Talking about me?

28:01.244 --> 28:02.811
Where are the potions?

28:02.985 --> 28:04.465
Potions?

28:04.639 --> 28:06.989
Oh, I think I left them
in the kitchen.

28:07.163 --> 28:08.251
[cracks neck]

28:08.425 --> 28:10.253
What was that?

28:10.427 --> 28:12.081
What was what?

28:12.255 --> 28:15.694
Okay, uh, I'll get them
from the kitchen.

28:15.868 --> 28:18.044
So keep your eye on us
after we transform

28:18.218 --> 28:20.089
and make sure we don't move
any of the crystals.

28:20.263 --> 28:21.917
Oh, no, I-I don't want
Leo here,

28:22.091 --> 28:23.484
in case we attack him.

28:23.658 --> 28:25.225
[doorbell rings]

28:25.399 --> 28:27.618
Who could that be?Oh, I think I know.

28:27.793 --> 28:30.099
I'll take care of it.Well, you better hurry.

28:31.144 --> 28:32.798
Why would you attack me?

28:32.972 --> 28:35.801
Well, technically,
you're still an Elder

28:35.975 --> 28:37.803
and we feel the same way
about Elders

28:37.977 --> 28:40.675
as we do whitelighters,
so... just to be safe.

28:40.849 --> 28:43.373
So you view me as a threat?

28:44.418 --> 28:45.854
Probably.

28:47.464 --> 28:48.552
[cracks neck]

28:53.601 --> 28:55.908
Hi.
Leslie, hey.

28:56.082 --> 28:57.300
Let me guess, bad time?

28:57.474 --> 28:58.780
Actually...Look, I-I just wanted

28:58.954 --> 29:00.434
to apologize.For what?

29:00.608 --> 29:02.958
Well, for the way I
acted earlier. I was...

29:03.132 --> 29:04.743
I was just so...

29:05.874 --> 29:07.528
Yeah, really upset,
I know.

29:07.702 --> 29:09.835
Well now who's finishing
whose sentences?

29:10.009 --> 29:12.446
Yeah.Look, I-I just didn't want to
leave it like that, that's all.

29:12.620 --> 29:15.188
And I don't either, uh,
but is it possible

29:15.362 --> 29:16.755
that I could maybe
call you tomorrow?

29:16.929 --> 29:19.061
W-We're running
out of tomorrows.

29:19.235 --> 29:20.584
[glass breaks]Uh.

29:20.759 --> 29:22.151
Yeah, I know, uh...

29:22.325 --> 29:24.066
I'm going to call you
tomorrow, I promise.

29:24.240 --> 29:25.764
'Kay.
But...

29:29.419 --> 29:30.812
Leo, what are
you doing?

29:30.986 --> 29:32.901
Television!

29:33.075 --> 29:34.773
[television crashes]

29:35.774 --> 29:37.471
Piper, you okay?

29:37.645 --> 29:39.038
No.

29:39.212 --> 29:41.040
Still think Leo's fine?That wasn't Leo.

29:41.214 --> 29:43.869
He was possessed
or something.

29:44.043 --> 29:45.174
Again?

29:45.348 --> 29:47.046
Well, it seems
to happen an awful lot.

29:47.220 --> 29:48.482
PHOEBE:
And if it did
happen again,

29:48.656 --> 29:50.092
it can't be connected
to the blue moon

29:50.266 --> 29:52.181
'cause it's not up yet.

29:52.355 --> 29:54.749
Maybe it's the whole
New Power thing.

29:54.923 --> 29:55.924
Maybe that's
who's setting Leo up.

29:56.098 --> 29:57.317
But why? For what?

29:57.491 --> 30:01.712
Well, if Agent Brody's
right, for power.

30:11.113 --> 30:12.941
Oh, okay,
now what?Throw the potion.

30:13.855 --> 30:15.074
[screams]

30:17.511 --> 30:18.817
Hey.

30:18.991 --> 30:20.166
Over here.

30:22.690 --> 30:24.474
Piper.

30:28.522 --> 30:30.002
You have betrayed us. Again!

30:30.176 --> 30:32.308
What are you doing?

30:32.482 --> 30:34.267
I'm warning you.
Stay out of this.

30:34.441 --> 30:35.964
Oh no, Piper, do not.

30:36.138 --> 30:37.487
You will be stopped.

30:46.322 --> 30:48.281
[beasts roaring]

31:13.088 --> 31:14.307
Oh, what happened?

31:14.481 --> 31:16.309
You attacked us.
Oh, really?

31:16.483 --> 31:18.180
Then how come I'm the
one with the headache?

31:18.354 --> 31:20.052
We were forced
to defend ourselves.

31:21.357 --> 31:22.358
Where's Leo?

31:22.532 --> 31:23.707
I sent him away.

31:23.882 --> 31:24.795
Away where?

31:24.970 --> 31:26.449
That's none of your concern now.

31:27.276 --> 31:28.582
You attempted to save him.

31:28.756 --> 31:30.889
You failed. That's that.

31:31.063 --> 31:32.064
The hell it is.

31:32.238 --> 31:35.284
He tried to kill
two more Elders.

31:35.458 --> 31:36.546
PAIGE:
No, he was possessed.

31:36.720 --> 31:38.418
You just didn't see it.

31:38.592 --> 31:40.681
No, what I saw was something
I never would have imagined.

31:40.855 --> 31:43.249
The Charmed Ones
turning into demons.

31:43.423 --> 31:45.773
No, that wasn't
demonic, that was...

31:45.947 --> 31:47.296
you know, that
time of the month.

31:47.470 --> 31:49.211
No, it was a blue moon.

31:49.385 --> 31:52.040
The point is we didn't have
a choice; we can't control it.

31:52.214 --> 31:53.520
Which is why
I'm keeping you here

31:53.694 --> 31:54.738
until we figure out
what to do with you.

31:54.913 --> 31:56.610
What to do with us?

31:56.784 --> 31:58.568
You need to let us go so we can
find out who the real demon is.

31:58.742 --> 31:59.961
Out of the question.

32:00.135 --> 32:01.267
Then, I guess
you won't be finding out

32:01.441 --> 32:02.442
about that New Power.

32:03.965 --> 32:05.706
Only they could have sent
the demon after Leo.

32:05.880 --> 32:08.665
You said yourself they may be
coming after the Elders next.

32:09.797 --> 32:11.451
But what
if you turn back into...

32:11.625 --> 32:13.279
Oh, that was just the blue moon.

32:13.453 --> 32:14.715
It won't happen
for another 50 years.

32:14.889 --> 32:16.238
PIPER:
Yeah, and by that time,

32:16.412 --> 32:17.631
we'll just be a menace
to our rest home,

32:17.805 --> 32:18.806
so I think you're safe.

32:19.763 --> 32:20.764
Very well.

32:20.939 --> 32:21.983
See what you can find out.

32:22.157 --> 32:23.811
No, not without Leo first.

32:23.985 --> 32:24.812
He can't be trusted.

32:24.986 --> 32:25.987
He wouldn't be

32:26.161 --> 32:27.597
vulnerable to possession if...

32:27.771 --> 32:29.512
You can give us Leo now

32:29.686 --> 32:31.950
or you can find your own damn
connection to the New Power.

32:37.259 --> 32:39.044
What's going on?

32:39.218 --> 32:41.524
You're about to be
exonerated, again.

32:42.482 --> 32:44.919
Book of Shadows.

32:50.011 --> 32:52.709
What else do you want from me?

32:52.883 --> 32:54.189
I did what you asked.

32:54.363 --> 32:55.712
[cracks neck]

32:55.886 --> 32:57.192
You gotta protect me.

32:57.366 --> 32:58.367
They'll find me.

32:58.541 --> 32:59.978
PIPER:
We already have.

33:04.199 --> 33:06.680
Who were you talking to?

33:10.510 --> 33:12.512
What happened?

33:12.686 --> 33:13.730
Did you just freeze me?

33:13.904 --> 33:15.254
She asked you a question.

33:17.473 --> 33:18.779
Would you rather I blew you up?

33:18.953 --> 33:21.869
Wait, don't.

33:22.043 --> 33:24.828
If I tell you, they'll kill me.

33:25.003 --> 33:26.526
If you don't tell us,
we'll kill you.

33:26.700 --> 33:28.658
You may want to
pick your poison.

33:31.705 --> 33:33.359
They're more powerful
than anything you've ever seen.

33:33.533 --> 33:34.490
Who is?

33:35.578 --> 33:37.841
No!

33:41.367 --> 33:43.108
Well, I guess Leo

33:43.282 --> 33:44.544
wasn't seeing
things after all.

33:44.718 --> 33:47.503
Can we get out
of here now please?

33:47.677 --> 33:49.505
Whoever you are,

33:49.679 --> 33:51.986
stay away from my husband.

34:11.614 --> 34:13.573
[phone rings]

34:17.533 --> 34:18.621
Brody.

34:18.795 --> 34:20.014
Paige, hey.

34:20.188 --> 34:21.233
I was getting worried.

34:21.407 --> 34:22.930
Yeah, I know.

34:23.104 --> 34:24.758
That's why I wanted to call you

34:24.932 --> 34:26.412
to let you know I was okay.

34:26.586 --> 34:28.675
Um, I'm glad you did.

34:28.849 --> 34:30.068
So what happened?

34:30.242 --> 34:31.678
This New Power
wasn't really after you?

34:31.852 --> 34:33.114
No, it, um...

34:33.288 --> 34:36.900
was actually
after something else.

34:37.075 --> 34:40.687
Oh... I mean that's, uh...

34:40.861 --> 34:42.297
that's good obviously.

34:44.473 --> 34:46.084
I was just hoping to,
you know...

34:46.258 --> 34:47.955
get a lead out of this,
that's all.

34:48.129 --> 34:50.175
If it makes you feel any better,

34:50.349 --> 34:51.698
they were
after my brother-in-law.

34:51.872 --> 34:53.613
Brother-in-law?

34:53.787 --> 34:54.788
Yeah, well, not directly.

34:54.962 --> 34:56.268
They actually used a demon

34:56.442 --> 34:58.618
to get to him.What, a demon?

34:58.792 --> 35:00.924
Well, he's fine now, though,
you know, we dispossessed him...

35:01.099 --> 35:02.361
Wait, you did what?

35:02.535 --> 35:04.406
Well, we got rid of the demon.

35:04.580 --> 35:06.582
We get possessed all the time,
it's no big deal.

35:06.756 --> 35:08.584
[chuckles]

35:08.758 --> 35:10.804
Hello?

35:10.978 --> 35:13.328
Um... yeah, sorry.

35:13.502 --> 35:16.592
I guess I'm just a little
new at this stuff.

35:16.766 --> 35:19.117
I thought you said
you knew about demons?

35:19.291 --> 35:20.944
Uh, no.

35:21.119 --> 35:23.338
I said I knew
a lot about witches.

35:23.512 --> 35:26.646
The rest are just,
um... theories.

35:28.126 --> 35:29.388
That is, until I met you.

35:29.562 --> 35:32.434
Well, be careful
what you wish for.

35:32.608 --> 35:34.001
What do you mean?

35:34.175 --> 35:35.655
What you don't know can't
hurt you, right?

35:35.829 --> 35:37.961
Well, it's already hurt me,
that's why I'm here.

35:40.964 --> 35:42.314
I'm glad you're okay, Paige.

35:43.837 --> 35:45.447
Thanks.

35:47.536 --> 35:49.451
Bye.

35:49.625 --> 35:51.584
Yeah.

35:52.976 --> 35:54.978
[phone beeps off]

35:58.939 --> 36:00.941
[phone ringing,
indistinct office chatter]

36:08.688 --> 36:09.254
Hey.

36:11.734 --> 36:13.345
Hey.

36:14.433 --> 36:15.869
Packing up?

36:16.913 --> 36:18.393
Yep, packing up.

36:18.567 --> 36:20.090
I left all your stuff
in the bottom cabinet.

36:20.265 --> 36:21.614
I can... I can put it back
if you want.

36:21.788 --> 36:23.224
No, that's okay. I can do it.

36:26.619 --> 36:27.794
So what time's your flight?

36:29.143 --> 36:30.318
Noon.

36:32.407 --> 36:33.887
So you ready to come back?

36:34.061 --> 36:35.105
More than you know.

36:36.542 --> 36:38.065
Thanks to you.

36:38.239 --> 36:41.068
Me? No, I didn't do anything.

36:41.242 --> 36:43.375
I just kept
the seat warm for you.

36:43.549 --> 36:45.681
You did more than that.

36:45.855 --> 36:47.074
And you know it.

36:50.338 --> 36:52.645
When I first met you, I was...

36:54.429 --> 36:56.953
...totally lost.

36:57.127 --> 37:00.522
That's why I needed to get away
from all of this, you know?

37:00.696 --> 37:02.785
I couldn't

37:02.959 --> 37:04.874
give advice.

37:05.048 --> 37:06.615
Especially not about love.

37:08.443 --> 37:10.402
And I realized that...

37:13.318 --> 37:14.884
...I was just afraid.

37:17.844 --> 37:19.411
But I'm not afraid anymore.

37:32.424 --> 37:33.642
Thank you.

37:33.816 --> 37:36.254
You're welcome.

37:38.734 --> 37:40.823
I guess it just wasn't
meant to be, huh?

37:40.997 --> 37:42.085
You and me?

37:42.260 --> 37:44.566
Maybe not right now.

37:46.655 --> 37:49.789
But I do think our signs
are compatible, so...

38:14.161 --> 38:16.163
See you.

38:17.164 --> 38:19.166
See you.

38:30.525 --> 38:32.484
[exhales]

38:35.138 --> 38:37.140
[door closes]

38:39.012 --> 38:40.840
Where were you?
I was worried?

38:41.014 --> 38:43.408
I was just...
checking on the boys.

38:44.539 --> 38:46.019
Uh, we found the
possessor demon

38:46.193 --> 38:47.499
right where you
said he'd be.

38:47.673 --> 38:48.978
Did you vanquish him?

38:49.152 --> 38:52.765
No, uh... but some
creature head thing did.

38:52.939 --> 38:53.766
You saw him?

38:53.940 --> 38:55.289
Yeah, we saw it.

38:55.463 --> 38:57.247
And I don't think we've
seen the last of it.

38:57.422 --> 38:59.467
That's what I'm worried about.

39:02.557 --> 39:03.602
Come on, let's go home.

39:03.776 --> 39:05.473
I can't.

39:07.388 --> 39:09.651
Well, the Elders said
you were free to go.

39:09.825 --> 39:12.872
It's not the Elders
I'm worried about, Piper.

39:13.046 --> 39:15.744
I'm worried about you,
I'm worried about everybody.

39:16.963 --> 39:18.486
Look, the Elders
were right.

39:18.660 --> 39:21.228
This New Power
was after me

39:21.402 --> 39:22.882
because I was vulnerable.

39:23.056 --> 39:25.145
You know, vulnerable enough
to put my family at risk.

39:26.973 --> 39:28.409
Piper...

39:28.583 --> 39:29.976
you were almost killed
because of me,

39:30.150 --> 39:31.499
because of what
they did to me

39:31.673 --> 39:33.414
and I can't let
that happen.

39:33.588 --> 39:35.503
I won't.
Leo,

39:35.677 --> 39:37.723
I know you've been
through a lot, I do.

39:37.897 --> 39:39.812
But you fought so hard.

39:39.986 --> 39:41.422
And the boys
need you.

39:41.596 --> 39:43.511
I need you.

39:44.599 --> 39:46.732
It's too dangerous.

39:48.168 --> 39:50.039
I have to stay away from you

39:50.213 --> 39:51.606
for your own sake.

39:51.780 --> 39:53.521
I'm sorry.
