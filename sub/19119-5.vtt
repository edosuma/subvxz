00:01.001 --> 00:04.038
-Previously on Outsiders...
-Get down!

00:04.038 --> 00:07.208
-Nice write-up here about
you arresting that Farrell.

00:07.208 --> 00:08.642
-What's this?
-We got the guy.

00:08.642 --> 00:10.078
-I mean, I certainly wanna
catch the person

00:10.078 --> 00:11.212
who killed my brother-in-law,

00:11.212 --> 00:13.614
but I'd like it to be the person
who actually killed him.

00:14.682 --> 00:16.284
-Hasil Farrell.
-I'm Butch.

00:16.284 --> 00:17.618
Say, Hasil, you need money?

00:17.618 --> 00:20.154
-I need that money
to go on a date.

00:20.154 --> 00:22.056
-I told you I ain't got it.

00:22.056 --> 00:23.391
-Get the hell outta here.

00:25.559 --> 00:26.560
-I'm pregnant.

00:28.329 --> 00:30.598
-Oh, hell.
-Butch, I need your help.

00:30.598 --> 00:32.733
-I am Morgan
and we are the Kinnah.

00:32.733 --> 00:35.236
-Banishment's the proper
sentence for what you done.

00:35.236 --> 00:36.570
Only the mountain
already banished you.

00:36.570 --> 00:38.839
(gun firing)

00:38.839 --> 00:41.509
-Put you through some kind of
hell down there.

00:41.509 --> 00:43.111
-Stitch him up.

00:43.111 --> 00:44.212
(screaming)

00:44.212 --> 00:45.446
-And then brought you back.

00:47.281 --> 00:50.118
-You go outside
and you run as far as you can.

00:50.118 --> 00:51.752
And don't you
never come back.

01:00.261 --> 01:02.163
(screaming)

01:07.435 --> 01:08.769
-(knock on door)
-Oh!

01:10.304 --> 01:12.306
(knocking on door)

01:12.306 --> 01:14.108
(groans)

01:21.315 --> 01:22.316
Hey!

01:22.316 --> 01:23.751
Oy! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:23.751 --> 01:26.120
What the hell you think
you're doin', huh?

01:26.120 --> 01:28.389
That's my generator.
That's my generator.

01:28.389 --> 01:30.224
My...

01:30.224 --> 01:31.359
You get English?

01:31.359 --> 01:32.760
My generator!

01:39.400 --> 01:42.736
Oh. All right, go on.

01:42.736 --> 01:43.737
Git.

01:45.339 --> 01:46.874
Git.

02:02.190 --> 02:03.891
(country blues music)

02:05.726 --> 02:06.627
* The dawn is up *

02:06.627 --> 02:09.763
* There's fire on the mountain *

02:09.763 --> 02:13.834
* They'll have to answer
for their crooked claim *

02:13.834 --> 02:17.405
* The hollows
they'll surround them *

02:17.405 --> 02:19.773
* And they'll go running back *

02:19.773 --> 02:22.843
* To the wretched realm
they came *

02:25.479 --> 02:31.785
* Nor will the dogs of hell
refrain *

02:31.785 --> 02:37.325
* And the land will suffer
those who came. *

02:43.897 --> 02:45.933
VIDEO GAME: Round one, fight!

02:45.933 --> 02:47.201
-Yeah!

02:47.201 --> 02:49.670
(video game sound effects)

02:49.670 --> 02:50.838
I wanted to play last night.

02:50.838 --> 02:52.573
Y'all were crashed out
on my couch.

02:52.573 --> 02:54.242
(screaming on video game)

02:54.242 --> 02:55.576
Couldn't wait no mo'.

02:55.576 --> 02:57.311
Need to get my game on.

02:59.313 --> 03:00.481
Yeah!

03:00.481 --> 03:01.915
Y'all said just one night,
right?

03:01.915 --> 03:03.784
-(sighs)

03:03.784 --> 03:07.421
It, uh, may be a little bit
longer 'n that.

03:07.421 --> 03:09.357
-You know you broke his nose?

03:09.357 --> 03:12.693
I had to hold an ice pack to it
for two hours.

03:12.693 --> 03:14.295
-Yeah, right
'til the swelling went down.

03:14.295 --> 03:15.563
-Yeah, that's right.

03:15.563 --> 03:19.700
-I give you my full sorry for
butting heads with you, Butch.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.935
All right?
I truly feel bad about it.

03:23.737 --> 03:25.473
-You're only sorry
'cause you need to be.

03:30.311 --> 03:31.879
-Look, please.

03:31.879 --> 03:34.315
We're kinda stuck
without a place to go.

03:34.315 --> 03:36.817
If you just let us stay here
a couple more days

03:36.817 --> 03:40.321
'til we figure things out,
we'd appreciate it.

03:42.356 --> 03:43.457
-Y'all are pregnant.

03:47.027 --> 03:48.028
-That true?

03:48.028 --> 03:50.764
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

03:50.764 --> 03:53.267
-And it's a good thing you know
because other than Sally-Ann,

03:53.267 --> 03:56.904
you're the closest thing I got
to a friend down here, Butch.

03:56.904 --> 03:58.472
-(chuckles)

04:01.275 --> 04:04.345
(sighs)

04:04.345 --> 04:05.346
-Peace pipe.

04:07.715 --> 04:08.816
-Be in the kitchen.

04:08.816 --> 04:10.684
-(coughing)

04:13.387 --> 04:14.988
-Can I help?

04:17.057 --> 04:19.760
-Well, might need
to fry up some more eggs

04:19.760 --> 04:21.895
now that you're eating for two.

04:24.665 --> 04:26.500
-God!
-Yeah!

04:26.500 --> 04:28.402
-Men are such boys.

04:28.402 --> 04:30.671
Best pray for a little girl.

04:30.671 --> 04:32.606
-Yeah.

04:32.606 --> 04:35.075
How'd you, uh... how'd you know?

04:35.075 --> 04:37.678
-Well, you didn't drink
any beer last night.

04:37.678 --> 04:39.647
You're avoiding the bong smoke
like it's the plague,

04:39.647 --> 04:42.583
and you're doing a lot of this.

04:42.583 --> 04:45.553
Plus, I'm a little bit psychic.

04:45.553 --> 04:47.488
Gonna be a mother myself
one day.

04:49.390 --> 04:50.624
-That's great.

04:52.726 --> 04:55.629
Can you...?

04:55.629 --> 04:57.865
-Yeah, this kitchen
didn't come with no oven,

04:57.865 --> 05:03.604
but there's always adoption
or surrogacy, you know?

05:03.604 --> 05:05.906
Once that boy in there
decides to become a man.

05:07.708 --> 05:08.709
-Yeah!

05:08.709 --> 05:10.344
(laughing)
Did you see that?

05:12.012 --> 05:13.381
-Mm-hmm.

05:19.487 --> 05:20.488
-Oh!
-Sheriff.

05:20.488 --> 05:21.589
-Hi, Don, you're back.

05:21.589 --> 05:24.358
-I'm just picking up
a couple things I left behind.

05:24.358 --> 05:25.693
Coffee mug.

05:25.693 --> 05:27.127
Wife made it for me.

05:27.127 --> 05:29.062
Prison's always short
on coffee cups so--

05:29.062 --> 05:30.898
-Hmm.
How's Tri-County treatin' you?

05:30.898 --> 05:32.500
-Eh, uh, you know,

05:32.500 --> 05:33.867
they tell you
be careful what you wish for.

05:33.867 --> 05:38.572
-Yeah. Hey, uh, Don,
how's that Farrell doing?

05:38.572 --> 05:40.908
-Not too good.
Tried to escape the other day.

05:40.908 --> 05:42.843
Took about a half dozen men
to bring him down,

05:42.843 --> 05:45.846
stuff him in a restraint chair
and stuck him in SA.

05:45.846 --> 05:47.815
-In solitary, is he?

05:47.815 --> 05:49.383
-He's back in gen pop now.

05:51.719 --> 05:52.720
FOSTER:
They're lackies.

05:52.720 --> 05:55.055
They don't wash themselves
without her order.

05:55.055 --> 05:57.591
She told 'em
to take my generator.

05:57.591 --> 05:58.859
And don't you deny it.

05:58.859 --> 06:00.060
-I shan't deny it.

06:00.060 --> 06:02.162
I ordered my Kinnah
to remove the machine.

06:02.162 --> 06:04.665
FOSTER: Well, the penalty
for thieving is the box.

06:04.665 --> 06:06.900
Bren'in, how many days
will you give this cutpurse?

06:06.900 --> 06:08.936
-I asked her to do it.

06:08.936 --> 06:10.604
-Okay, well,
I must be hearing voices

06:10.604 --> 06:12.940
'cause I thought
I heard you just say

06:12.940 --> 06:14.808
that you asked for this.

06:14.808 --> 06:16.544
-Generators run on fry oil.

06:16.544 --> 06:17.511
-So?

06:17.511 --> 06:20.080
-So the people below
are fencing us up here.

06:20.080 --> 06:21.515
We need to conserve
our resources

06:21.515 --> 06:23.484
and not waste fuel
on generators.

06:23.484 --> 06:27.187
-Chasing weak modernity
puts your clan in danger.

06:27.187 --> 06:29.056
The demons below
want to possess thee.

06:29.056 --> 06:31.158
They want you to bring their
poisonous practices up here

06:31.158 --> 06:33.594
'til all that makes the mountain
pure will be put to ruin.

06:33.594 --> 06:37.130
-Oh, aren't you
the cock of the walk.

06:37.130 --> 06:39.767
You and your group of mutes,
strolling in there,

06:39.767 --> 06:41.134
doing what you please,
and you let her.

06:41.134 --> 06:42.936
-These are my decisions.

06:42.936 --> 06:44.438
And I've decided
that all generators,

06:44.438 --> 06:45.673
not just yours, be removed.

06:45.673 --> 06:46.974
-Ah, well, I don't know how,

06:46.974 --> 06:49.443
but somehow
this is all to her benefit.

06:49.443 --> 06:51.044
Just like her torching
the smokehouse.

06:51.044 --> 06:53.046
-Foster--
-There's no way, no how,

06:53.046 --> 06:55.516
Hezzy would ever let it burn.

06:55.516 --> 06:57.985
He cared for that smokehouse
like it was his home.

06:57.985 --> 06:59.953
That fire, it was set.

06:59.953 --> 07:01.689
Sure as shit.

07:01.689 --> 07:03.791
MORGAN:
We're of a like mind on that.

07:03.791 --> 07:05.526
But by whose hand?

07:05.526 --> 07:07.628
Most like by yours,
don't you think, Bren'in?

07:07.628 --> 07:09.062
-Aye,
she knows I didn't do it.

07:09.062 --> 07:10.631
So you shut your yap.

07:10.631 --> 07:11.431
-Enough!

07:13.567 --> 07:15.603
Lil Foster's
been gone a week now.

07:15.603 --> 07:17.004
You wanted to
look for him before.

07:17.004 --> 07:18.672
Now's your time.

07:18.672 --> 07:23.711
-Well, there is nothing
that I want more, my queen.

07:23.711 --> 07:26.547
But them ashes, they've cooled,

07:26.547 --> 07:28.148
and we owe Hezzy
a sacred obligation

07:28.148 --> 07:29.783
to fetch his remains for burial.

07:29.783 --> 07:31.685
-I am aware of our obligations,
Foster,

07:31.685 --> 07:33.220
and they will be seen to.

07:33.220 --> 07:34.622
Go fetch your son.

07:37.825 --> 07:39.159
-As you want it.

07:55.776 --> 07:58.178
-There any particular reason
you're in my office?

07:58.178 --> 08:00.681
-Uh, yeah, please, have a seat.

08:00.681 --> 08:02.215
-I would, but my chair's taken.

08:02.215 --> 08:04.718
(sighs)

08:04.718 --> 08:07.621
-Oh, yeah. (chuckles)
Let's switch.

08:07.621 --> 08:08.956
(clears throat)

08:08.956 --> 08:12.560
I got a call from
County Supervisor Adams.

08:12.560 --> 08:13.961
You know what department
he oversees?

08:13.961 --> 08:15.128
-Uh, yeah, Corrections.

08:15.128 --> 08:17.731
-Yeah, of course you know,
you called him this morning,

08:17.731 --> 08:19.299
asked him
to pull a few strings,

08:19.299 --> 08:21.234
tried to get that Farrell
transferred to county jail.

08:21.234 --> 08:24.905
See, that costs money,
and I had told the supervisors

08:24.905 --> 08:27.975
that any expenditures needed
my approval first.

08:27.975 --> 08:30.143
-Well, my batting average
isn't so good

08:30.143 --> 08:33.747
when it comes to
coming to you for help.

08:33.747 --> 08:36.083
Tri-County's
maximum security.

08:36.083 --> 08:37.551
He's a first-time offender.

08:37.551 --> 08:39.653
-Uh, first-time murderer,
remember?

08:39.653 --> 08:41.054
(knocks) We got the guy.

08:41.054 --> 08:42.756
-Yeah, see, we're playing
this kind of tug-o'-war

08:42.756 --> 08:44.191
where, you know,
you're convinced

08:44.191 --> 08:47.995
that you got the right guy
and I'm not.

08:47.995 --> 08:50.063
And pretty soon,
one of us is gonna end up

08:50.063 --> 08:52.132
lying face-down in the mud

08:52.132 --> 08:55.235
or you could show some decency
and move him over to County

08:55.235 --> 08:56.536
where he's gonna be safe.

08:58.939 --> 09:00.340
-Yeah.
County's overcrowded.

09:00.340 --> 09:01.975
-Yeah, well, then you put
a bed in the hall.

09:01.975 --> 09:03.176
It's been done before.

09:06.279 --> 09:09.349
-You know, I checked up on you
before I came here.

09:09.349 --> 09:10.951
-Oh, yeah?

09:10.951 --> 09:13.020
-Yeah.

09:13.020 --> 09:14.955
What is it with you
and your weird fascination

09:14.955 --> 09:16.657
with the Farrells?

09:16.657 --> 09:18.659
-Seems they got a raw deal
around here, that's all.

09:18.659 --> 09:20.661
-Okay, but we have other
pressing issues too.

09:20.661 --> 09:22.162
Like, two fence guards
gone missing.

09:22.162 --> 09:23.230
WADE:
Oh, yeah? Who's that?

09:23.230 --> 09:24.998
-Mike Miller
and Luke Wainwright.

09:24.998 --> 09:27.768
-Wow. Oh, that's your fault then
for hiring untrained guys.

09:27.768 --> 09:28.636
I know those two.

09:28.636 --> 09:29.870
They're gonna be
on a bender somewhere.

09:29.870 --> 09:31.739
You'll find 'em in two days.

09:31.739 --> 09:34.241
They'll be sleepin' it off,
pukin' it up somewhere.

09:34.241 --> 09:36.343
Now, listen,
this Farrell guy, we gotta--

09:36.343 --> 09:38.779
-Oh, forget about
the goddamn Farrells!

09:44.618 --> 09:46.053
Look, Wade.

09:46.053 --> 09:47.821
My door is always open, okay?

09:47.821 --> 09:50.758
We can talk about family,
sports, movies, politics.

09:50.758 --> 09:51.591
I'm well read.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.961
But we don't discuss
the Farrells.

09:53.961 --> 09:55.395
From now on,
that's off the board.

09:55.395 --> 09:56.630
Are you okay with that,
Sheriff?

09:56.630 --> 09:57.831
-Yeah, that's fine by me.

09:57.831 --> 09:59.700
-Great, great.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.201
So, I'm gonna go now,

10:01.201 --> 10:04.838
and you get back to serving
and protecting, okay?

10:04.838 --> 10:06.840
-(clears throat)

10:08.408 --> 10:10.610
(birds chirping)

10:35.302 --> 10:36.970
-This is our table, Sasquatch.

10:38.739 --> 10:40.073
-Hmm.

10:40.073 --> 10:42.810
-For the privilege of using
our tables,

10:42.810 --> 10:44.945
everyone pays his tribute.

10:44.945 --> 10:49.382
Commissary, cigarettes,
special favors, whatever.

10:49.382 --> 10:52.319
-Ah, well.
I ain't got nothin' to give.

10:52.319 --> 10:54.054
-You don't need it.

10:54.054 --> 10:56.790
'Cause you're our honored guest.

10:56.790 --> 10:59.259
-And why's that?

10:59.259 --> 11:01.261
-Tell me your name
and I'll tell you why.

11:03.130 --> 11:04.732
-Foster Farrell VIII.

11:04.732 --> 11:06.900
(laughing) I knew it!

11:08.435 --> 11:10.337
A real live Farrell.

11:13.106 --> 11:14.708
Tobias Jager.

11:14.708 --> 11:16.176
Deeply honored.

11:16.176 --> 11:17.177
-Hmm.

11:18.946 --> 11:23.116
-Heard you dragged a dozen hacks
a whole cell block.

11:23.116 --> 11:25.753
-I don't know about that.

11:25.753 --> 11:28.021
-I have a thought, brothers.

11:28.021 --> 11:32.225
Strong Farrell like this
could be most valuable.

11:32.225 --> 11:35.796
So, Foster Farrell VIII...

11:37.798 --> 11:39.767
...care to be
part of our family?

11:42.736 --> 11:44.304
-I already got a family.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.010
-Lemme tell you
how things work.

11:52.012 --> 11:54.481
Any thug here
will mollywhop you

11:54.481 --> 11:57.985
every single day
just for your soap bar.

11:57.985 --> 12:01.321
Worse yet, lights out,
you go to bed and never wake up

12:01.321 --> 12:04.324
'cause you caught
a shiv in your sleep.

12:04.324 --> 12:08.996
Now that don't happen if
you got us watchin' your back.

12:08.996 --> 12:10.197
-Yeah, well.

12:10.197 --> 12:13.033
Think I can take care
of myself.

12:20.974 --> 12:22.242
-That's our food.

12:26.313 --> 12:28.081
-Your food tastes like shit.

12:44.031 --> 12:46.533
Swear, you'd lose your head
if it weren't screwed on.

12:46.533 --> 12:47.567
-Freda.

12:47.567 --> 12:48.936
-Hasil.

12:48.936 --> 12:51.238
-Hey, y'all seen my little
dub sacks?

12:51.238 --> 12:53.306
They're like little miniature
sandwich baggies.

12:55.508 --> 12:56.543
Have you seen 'em?

12:56.543 --> 12:58.411
-Uh-uh.

12:58.411 --> 13:00.480
-Hmm, never mind.

13:02.482 --> 13:06.419
-I need prenatal vitamins,
and I need to get to a doctor

13:06.419 --> 13:08.321
at least once a month
for the first eight months

13:08.321 --> 13:10.457
and then once a week
for the last month.

13:12.525 --> 13:14.027
-Sure, we can do that.

13:14.027 --> 13:16.296
-And it'll probably be
around $10,000.

13:18.265 --> 13:19.599
-And that's a lot.

13:19.599 --> 13:22.402
-It is a lot.

13:22.402 --> 13:24.304
And I don't have insurance,
so...

13:24.304 --> 13:25.906
-What is that?

13:25.906 --> 13:29.076
-It pays for most of
the doctor's bills.

13:29.076 --> 13:31.178
-(sighs)

13:31.178 --> 13:33.847
Up on the mountain,
all you do is you go into a tent

13:33.847 --> 13:36.149
with the midwife and
you come out with the baby.

13:36.149 --> 13:37.484
I mean--

13:37.484 --> 13:40.453
-Are you saying that you
want the baby up there?

13:40.453 --> 13:44.224
-Mm-mm. It's just sometimes,
up there, things...

13:44.224 --> 13:46.359
you know,
things are easier, that's all.

13:46.359 --> 13:48.395
-Yeah.

13:48.395 --> 13:50.197
-All right, c'mon.

13:50.197 --> 13:52.232
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon,
c'mon, c'mon.

13:52.232 --> 13:54.401
(kisses) C'mon.

13:54.401 --> 13:56.136
Look at me.

13:57.370 --> 14:00.207
How we gonna do this? Mm?

14:00.207 --> 14:04.111
What about if I get me
one of them, one of them jobs?

14:04.111 --> 14:07.514
-Well, as much as I would
appreciate it, Hasil Farrell,

14:07.514 --> 14:09.249
you don't have
a Social Security number.

14:09.249 --> 14:12.352
-I don't know what that is.
What kind of number?

14:12.352 --> 14:14.888
-Proves who you are so you can
get paid for your work.

14:14.888 --> 14:16.256
-C'mon, why do I need to prove
who I am?

14:16.256 --> 14:19.159
All I do is I walk up,
I say, "Hello." -Hello.

14:19.159 --> 14:22.996
-"My name is Hasil Farrell,"
and that should be enough.

14:24.397 --> 14:26.333
-Should be enough, but...

14:28.501 --> 14:30.603
I don't wanna sound mean or--

14:32.139 --> 14:33.941
What skills do you have?

14:33.941 --> 14:35.608
-Down here?

14:35.608 --> 14:37.577
(sighing)

14:37.577 --> 14:38.645
-Listen, it's fine.

14:38.645 --> 14:40.580
I'm happy to be the one
that works.

14:40.580 --> 14:44.217
As long as I have you with me,
it's fine.

14:45.418 --> 14:47.287
-Mm.
-Mm-mm.

14:51.324 --> 14:54.127
-Past couple o' days right after
I'd fill up Hank's bowl,

14:54.127 --> 14:55.462
he'd be howlin' for more.

14:55.462 --> 14:57.164
So I put his food out
this morning

14:57.164 --> 15:00.233
and I watched from my window
yonder, and I saw him

15:00.233 --> 15:03.070
crawl out from under there
and steal it.

15:03.070 --> 15:04.071
(dog barks)

15:06.106 --> 15:07.507
-Yeah, okay.

15:11.178 --> 15:13.580
Hi, there.

15:13.580 --> 15:17.217
I'm the sheriff,
and my name's Wade Houghton.

15:17.217 --> 15:19.219
You wanna come out
from the dirt?

15:24.091 --> 15:25.125
There you go.

15:25.125 --> 15:27.127
(dog barking)

15:32.265 --> 15:34.234
-You wanna keep coming
or are you happy there?

15:34.234 --> 15:35.402
-I'm good here.

15:38.338 --> 15:39.472
-What's your name?

15:39.472 --> 15:40.974
-Samuel.

15:40.974 --> 15:43.043
-Samuel, okay.

15:43.043 --> 15:44.577
Well, what's your last name?

15:44.577 --> 15:46.113
-I dunno.

15:46.113 --> 15:47.314
-Everybody got a last name.

15:47.314 --> 15:49.316
-Oh, he's-- he's traumatized,
Sheriff.

15:49.316 --> 15:50.383
Probably can't remember goin'--

15:50.383 --> 15:52.152
-Annette, just go over there

15:52.152 --> 15:55.222
and you feed your goddamn dog
before he chews his paws off.

16:00.293 --> 16:02.695
Well, how about an easy one
then? How old are you?

16:07.200 --> 16:09.469
You're eight years old?
That's the same age as my boy.

16:09.469 --> 16:11.104
Hey, you wanna come see
if you can show me

16:11.104 --> 16:12.272
where your parents' house is?

16:14.774 --> 16:17.377
How about you ride up
the front of the police car,

16:17.377 --> 16:19.479
you can play the siren
and when we see it,

16:19.479 --> 16:20.547
you can point it out?

16:22.715 --> 16:24.084
C'mon.

16:25.585 --> 16:27.354
-You'll get more answers
out of Hank.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.390
Hank! Hank!

16:30.390 --> 16:32.392
(men chattering)

16:47.074 --> 16:48.508
(groans)

16:53.646 --> 16:55.582
-Yo, man. What the hell
are you lookin' at?

16:55.582 --> 16:58.185
-I was lookin' at that.
How many stone is it?

16:58.185 --> 16:59.486
-You hear this fool?

16:59.486 --> 17:01.154
Stones.
There ain't no stones here.

17:01.154 --> 17:02.155
What you mean, stones?

17:02.155 --> 17:03.823
-I meant, it looks heavy.

17:03.823 --> 17:06.159
Surprised you can lift it.

17:06.159 --> 17:07.494
-Oh, you callin' me weak?

17:07.494 --> 17:11.531
-No, I didn't mean
any disrespect.

17:11.531 --> 17:12.799
Sorry for interrupting you.

17:12.799 --> 17:15.268
-Mm-mm.
Damn straight you're sorry.

17:15.268 --> 17:16.569
Punk-ass bitch.

17:17.604 --> 17:18.605
-Hey!

17:20.207 --> 17:21.241
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

17:25.278 --> 17:27.714
-Yeah, run and hide
behind them crackers.

17:34.754 --> 17:35.988
This ain't over.

17:35.988 --> 17:40.360
I'm gonna shove my katana up
your dumb, hillbilly, hick ass!

17:40.360 --> 17:41.361
I'll see you soon.

17:58.645 --> 18:01.114
-You got boulders on your backs?
Quit your lagging.

18:02.782 --> 18:03.683
-You said to Bren'in

18:03.683 --> 18:05.618
you wanted us to look for
Lil Foster.

18:05.618 --> 18:07.887
-Yeah.
What I wanna find right now

18:07.887 --> 18:10.357
is a way to get
them Kinnah gone.

18:10.357 --> 18:13.293
'Til that happens
I ain't leaving.

18:13.293 --> 18:15.828
Then I wanna find
what's left of Hezzy.

18:15.828 --> 18:17.230
So get to it.

18:23.303 --> 18:27.740
-So that fire,
that burned hottest right here.

18:30.743 --> 18:32.745
So it started right here.

18:36.283 --> 18:38.285
*

19:05.912 --> 19:07.914
*

19:26.466 --> 19:28.335
-You sure you can't get
any more of that shine?

19:28.335 --> 19:29.569
We'd make a killing.

19:29.569 --> 19:31.204
-Yeah, I'm sure.

19:31.204 --> 19:33.573
-All right.
She ain't gonna like this.

19:33.573 --> 19:35.208
-She gonna get me paper?

19:35.208 --> 19:37.410
-Yeah.
-Then it doesn't matter.

19:47.220 --> 19:48.388
-This where jobs are at?

19:48.388 --> 19:50.390
-Yeah, but not here.

19:50.390 --> 19:51.658
You gotta go
way over there.

19:56.263 --> 19:57.964
-Need two guys
work the parking lot.

19:57.964 --> 19:58.998
C'mon, it'll take all day.

19:58.998 --> 20:00.300
C'mon, let's go.

20:03.503 --> 20:05.272
-Hang on, hang on.
What happened there?

20:05.272 --> 20:07.540
-Job yesterday. Some klutz
dropped a brick on my foot.

20:07.540 --> 20:08.975
I'm fine, I can work.
-No, no, stop, stop, fella.

20:08.975 --> 20:10.410
I can't have a bad foot
slowing me down.

20:10.410 --> 20:11.811
You, skinny, you wanna work?

20:11.811 --> 20:12.912
-Yeah.
-Get in the back.

20:12.912 --> 20:14.247
Hurry, truck's moving.

20:14.247 --> 20:15.648
On our way. Here we go.

20:17.917 --> 20:19.519
-Want me turn here?

20:21.521 --> 20:23.022
D'you want me turn here?
-Maybe.

20:23.022 --> 20:24.757
-Are we at least
in the right neighborhood?

20:24.757 --> 20:26.659
-(mumbles "I don't know")

20:26.659 --> 20:28.027
-Which school do you go to?

20:28.027 --> 20:29.529
-I don't go to school.

20:31.764 --> 20:33.566
-What's the name of your street?

20:33.566 --> 20:35.935
-(mumbles "I don't know")

20:35.935 --> 20:38.738
-Listen, my little boy Caleb,
he ran off once.

20:38.738 --> 20:40.607
And when I found him,

20:40.607 --> 20:44.577
he thought I was gonna be
real mad at him, but I wasn't.

20:44.577 --> 20:48.014
I was just happy to see him.

20:48.014 --> 20:51.651
And... well, that's how
your parents are gonna be.

20:51.651 --> 20:53.486
They're just gonna be happy.

20:55.422 --> 20:57.357
-I remember Bear.

20:57.357 --> 20:59.626
-Bear? What's that there?

20:59.626 --> 21:02.595
Like, that's the name
of your street?

21:02.595 --> 21:04.397
Like, like Bear Run Road?

21:04.397 --> 21:05.465
-I think.

21:06.999 --> 21:08.935
-Bear Run Road?

21:08.935 --> 21:10.036
-Can I play the lights?

21:10.036 --> 21:11.438
-Yeah, go ahead.

21:11.438 --> 21:12.572
Turn that little thing
up there.

21:14.641 --> 21:17.644
(emergency siren)

21:22.549 --> 21:24.083
-I thought you were looking
for Lil Foster.

21:24.083 --> 21:25.818
-I was on my way,

21:25.818 --> 21:28.588
but I stopped
to get Hezzy's bones first.

21:28.588 --> 21:31.924
Faster we got them,
faster his spirit could rest.

21:31.924 --> 21:33.726
Don't you agree?

21:33.726 --> 21:37.430
-You think this is enough
to accuse a Kinnah of murder?

21:37.430 --> 21:39.098
They were there, watching
the fire, same as all of us.

21:39.098 --> 21:40.299
-Well, yeah.

21:40.299 --> 21:42.835
You see any of them on the
other side of the smokehouse?

21:44.371 --> 21:47.374
No, neither did I.

21:47.374 --> 21:49.909
Well, leastways, it's enough
to get Morgan on in here.

21:49.909 --> 21:51.744
Ask her some things.

21:51.744 --> 21:53.346
-I know what's happening.

21:53.346 --> 21:55.014
She angers you,
so now you're gonna spout

21:55.014 --> 21:56.549
false accusations about her.

21:56.549 --> 21:59.786
-No. That's the new way
of the world.

21:59.786 --> 22:03.590
You siding with that quail-pipe
over me.

22:03.590 --> 22:06.559
I consider myself to be
your most trusted counsel.

22:06.559 --> 22:08.861
-(scoffs)
Considering your history,

22:08.861 --> 22:11.764
I can't say your counsel's
most trusted.

22:11.764 --> 22:14.066
-Oh, well, I trust you,

22:14.066 --> 22:16.703
even being you sought to put me
in the ground.

22:19.506 --> 22:21.774
-You forgave that.

22:21.774 --> 22:24.010
Even though I never asked
for your forgiveness.

22:24.010 --> 22:27.614
-And I get it.
I'm far from a perfect man.

22:27.614 --> 22:30.750
But the day I returned,
I said that I love you.

22:32.385 --> 22:33.720
And I meant it.

22:33.720 --> 22:35.788
And before,
when you said you loved me,

22:35.788 --> 22:37.557
you spoke out of one side
of your mouth

22:37.557 --> 22:39.659
and you spat poison
out the other.

22:39.659 --> 22:42.429
-Loving the clan more
meant I had to do what I did.

22:43.663 --> 22:45.131
-Loving the clan more?

22:47.767 --> 22:50.470
Loving 'em more than what?

22:50.470 --> 22:51.738
Who more than who?

22:56.008 --> 22:57.644
-Since the day you returned,

22:57.644 --> 22:59.412
nothing you say can erase
the memory

22:59.412 --> 23:01.448
of your loving hand
squeezing the life out of me.

23:01.448 --> 23:02.782
-Oh, goddamn it.

23:02.782 --> 23:04.016
(glass breaking)

23:05.985 --> 23:08.455
-What the hell
do you want from me?

23:08.455 --> 23:10.923
Everything I'm doin'
is to help you.

23:10.923 --> 23:12.792
How much longer
are you gonna punish me?

23:12.792 --> 23:14.527
-You say you love me,

23:14.527 --> 23:16.729
but there's a struggle
inside of you.

23:16.729 --> 23:18.431
I am not all you crave.

23:18.431 --> 23:21.734
No, and I don't know which one's
gonna win out in the end.

23:21.734 --> 23:25.905
-Those, those...

23:25.905 --> 23:27.674
are her words.

23:27.674 --> 23:31.578
Oh, I see it now,
full-on clear.

23:33.112 --> 23:36.449
You blindly follow her
like a bootlicker.

23:36.449 --> 23:37.950
You hang on every word,

23:37.950 --> 23:40.920
lettin' her do as she pleases
just so you don't have to

23:40.920 --> 23:43.656
undertake any
difficult decisions yourself.

23:43.656 --> 23:45.157
-She gives sound counsel.

23:45.157 --> 23:46.959
-Okay, well,
the wisdom she spouts

23:46.959 --> 23:48.528
comes from a venomous tongue.

23:48.528 --> 23:49.896
You continue on this path

23:49.896 --> 23:52.465
and you won't be
much longer Bren'in.

23:52.465 --> 23:54.233
-Now, there's your truth.

23:54.233 --> 23:55.768
You know,
a grizzly without its claws,

23:55.768 --> 23:56.869
it remains a grizzly.

23:56.869 --> 24:00.039
-Oh, that is not what I want.

24:00.039 --> 24:01.941
I'm tryin' to guide you!

24:03.743 --> 24:05.578
You're just too bull-headed
to realize it.

24:05.578 --> 24:07.847
-I'd rather not be with those
who guide with one hand

24:07.847 --> 24:09.816
while reaching for the oak
with the other.

24:16.523 --> 24:18.157
-We'll see how you do
without me.

24:28.167 --> 24:29.168
(door closes)

24:49.556 --> 24:50.857
-Break time, fellas.

25:00.232 --> 25:01.233
-Hey.

25:02.635 --> 25:04.003
-Nah, I'm good.

25:19.318 --> 25:21.554
-What you think?

25:21.554 --> 25:23.322
-Sorry, Wade,
don't recognize him.

25:23.322 --> 25:25.758
-Yep. -And I know all the kids
around these parts.

25:25.758 --> 25:27.760
-Yeah. -Bunch of little
pain in the asses,

25:27.760 --> 25:29.996
always runnin' around yelling.
-Okay, thank you.

25:29.996 --> 25:32.565
Been to almost every single
house on goddamn Bear Run Road,

25:32.565 --> 25:35.001
not a single person knows you.

25:35.001 --> 25:36.002
This ain't your street.

25:37.269 --> 25:38.605
BRIAN:
Sheriff?

25:38.605 --> 25:41.073
WADE:
Oh, hi, Brian. How ya doin'?

25:41.073 --> 25:43.843
You still driving this
ol' hunk o' junk?

25:43.843 --> 25:45.311
-I wouldn't have to
if I wasn't unemployed

25:45.311 --> 25:47.079
goin' on two years now.

25:47.079 --> 25:49.616
-Been that long, has it, yeah?
Times are tough.

25:49.616 --> 25:51.884
-Yeah, well, been made tougher
by that sister of yours

25:51.884 --> 25:53.720
and her gang of bitches.

25:53.720 --> 25:57.990
Next time, chain 'em up,
or better yet, shoot 'em.

26:02.228 --> 26:03.696
-He was mean.

26:03.696 --> 26:05.164
-What?

26:05.164 --> 26:08.100
You wanna see mean?
You wanna see mean?

26:08.100 --> 26:09.836
Why you doin' this to me?

26:09.836 --> 26:11.170
This was supposed to be easy.

26:11.170 --> 26:12.371
You were supposed to
tell me where you live,

26:12.371 --> 26:13.906
I'll take you there.

26:19.646 --> 26:22.081
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Sam.
I didn't mean to yell.

26:22.081 --> 26:23.950
I just--I'm gettin'
a little tired.

26:25.785 --> 26:27.119
What do you want?
Do you wanna--

26:28.187 --> 26:29.255
(quietly) Goddamn.

26:29.255 --> 26:32.091
Take you out and get some food,
somethin' to eat?

26:32.091 --> 26:33.125
Yeah?

26:36.295 --> 26:38.197
That's the first thing
you've been sure about all day.

26:40.933 --> 26:41.934
Okay.

26:44.336 --> 26:47.373
(door opens)

26:47.373 --> 26:49.241
(clears throat)

26:49.241 --> 26:50.843
-Thank you, Annalivia.

26:50.843 --> 26:53.079
Morgan, thanks for coming.

26:53.079 --> 26:54.747
Always happy to see your face.

26:54.747 --> 26:55.915
-And I yours.

26:58.350 --> 27:01.353
I wish to thank you
for siding with me today.

27:01.353 --> 27:03.890
I know it did not come simply.

27:03.890 --> 27:07.727
A voice that speaks loudest
typically gets its desire.

27:09.829 --> 27:13.132
-The voice that speaks loudest
is very angry.

27:13.132 --> 27:14.967
-I'm not surprised.

27:14.967 --> 27:17.036
He sees the bond
you and I share.

27:17.036 --> 27:19.371
(kettle whistling)

27:19.371 --> 27:22.141
Allow me.

27:24.210 --> 27:28.214
-Your faith heartens me
for the future,

27:28.214 --> 27:32.752
that we can, as one,
work to preserve this clan.

27:36.789 --> 27:38.858
-It's why I summoned you.

27:38.858 --> 27:41.761
If we're to work together,
we should confide in each other,

27:41.761 --> 27:44.296
tell all that's in our minds,
hold nothing back.

27:44.296 --> 27:45.732
Don't you agree?

27:45.732 --> 27:46.866
-Of course.

27:46.866 --> 27:49.101
-It heartens me to hear that.

27:49.101 --> 27:52.805
I need to share something that's
been gnawing at me fierce.

27:52.805 --> 27:54.373
-Consider me your confidante.

28:00.813 --> 28:02.882
-I can't control Big Foster.

28:05.017 --> 28:06.853
As Bren'in,
I shouldn't have these doubts.

28:06.853 --> 28:09.455
I should be sure of my feelings.

28:09.455 --> 28:12.458
-By your own admission,
this man hurt you.

28:12.458 --> 28:14.193
And he hurt this clan.

28:14.193 --> 28:17.764
He must be handled
with a heavy hand.

28:17.764 --> 28:20.066
-It's a bit more complicated.

28:21.300 --> 28:22.835
There is good in him.

28:24.503 --> 28:25.938
It's still a--

28:29.809 --> 28:34.413
He continues to accuse you
for the smokehouse fire.

28:34.413 --> 28:36.415
He even brought me this.

28:36.415 --> 28:39.351
Things they found by the ashes.

28:39.351 --> 28:41.187
It's flimsy proof, I know,

28:41.187 --> 28:45.191
but I'd just feel better
if you told me it wasn't you.

28:59.872 --> 29:03.175
-The fire was by Kinnah hand.

29:03.175 --> 29:07.279
Your game was ill-gotten,
tainted and impure.

29:07.279 --> 29:10.449
Animals that are killed by
modern tools of destruction.

29:12.218 --> 29:14.020
-Y-Your game was destroyed too.

29:14.020 --> 29:15.855
Were they not purely killed?

29:15.855 --> 29:17.556
-The impure poisons the pure.

29:17.556 --> 29:21.093
Your game poisoned,
polluted ours.

29:21.093 --> 29:23.429
It all required purification
by fire.

29:24.931 --> 29:27.333
-You killed a man.

29:27.333 --> 29:29.068
-An unfortunate accident.

29:29.068 --> 29:31.037
It was not mine intent.

29:34.373 --> 29:36.442
-Leave. Now.

29:36.442 --> 29:39.511
-I only desire
for this mountain to survive,

29:39.511 --> 29:41.080
for this clan to survive.

29:41.080 --> 29:43.549
-Same as you.
-No, we are nothing of the same.

29:43.549 --> 29:45.451
-We have not the time
for conflict!

29:45.451 --> 29:48.387
-Hear me.
-No, get out! Now!

29:50.256 --> 29:53.860
-I yearned for us to preserve
this mountain together.

29:55.494 --> 29:58.965
Now it must be done with
nothing but mine own hand.

30:02.001 --> 30:04.403
(door opens, closes)

30:09.475 --> 30:12.578
-Eight hours, $10 an hour.

30:12.578 --> 30:14.046
There you go, my man.

30:20.619 --> 30:22.288
-That's it?
-That's it.

30:24.590 --> 30:26.893
-Why'd I get less?

30:26.893 --> 30:28.494
-You had three waters,
$5 each.

30:28.494 --> 30:30.462
You had three piss breaks,
$5 each.

30:30.462 --> 30:32.131
Hell, lunch was $10.

30:32.131 --> 30:33.465
So the charge is $40.

30:33.465 --> 30:36.468
$80 minus $40 equals them
two twenties.

30:36.468 --> 30:38.370
-Well, why didn't you tell me
that beforehand?

30:38.370 --> 30:40.372
-Well, just remember it
for next time.

30:55.955 --> 30:58.958
(rap music playing)

30:58.958 --> 31:00.459
-Whew, you smell like
oily turds.

31:00.459 --> 31:03.162
-That job was shit.

31:03.162 --> 31:05.431
Now even I know this ain't
nothing but a pittance.

31:07.399 --> 31:09.068
-Told you
you wasn't gonna like it.

31:09.068 --> 31:11.971
You said, "It don't matter."
Exact words.

31:15.241 --> 31:17.977
Look, man, I'm selling tonight.

31:17.977 --> 31:20.212
You don't need to help
with that, but...

31:20.212 --> 31:21.580
it's a crowded place.

31:21.580 --> 31:23.449
I could use someone
to watch my back.

31:25.952 --> 31:27.153
I'll kick you a couple bucks.

31:27.153 --> 31:28.320
Easy money. What do you say?

31:31.590 --> 31:33.159
-Fine.
-All right.

31:35.461 --> 31:37.629
But you gotta use soap first,
man, please.

31:37.629 --> 31:38.630
(coughs)

31:44.103 --> 31:45.437
-What you think?

31:47.673 --> 31:49.208
You like it?

31:51.710 --> 31:53.245
-Never had
"spasghetti" before.

31:53.245 --> 31:55.948
-Yeah, it's pretty good.
What you eat at home?

31:55.948 --> 31:57.216
-Soup.

31:57.216 --> 31:58.684
-What, just soup? Is that it?

31:58.684 --> 32:00.486
You have anything else?
Just soup?

32:00.486 --> 32:02.621
-Mostly.
-Huh.

32:02.621 --> 32:05.524
-Well, let me tell you
something, Sam.

32:05.524 --> 32:08.694
If my folks only gave me
soup to eat,

32:08.694 --> 32:10.696
I'd probably
wanna run away too.

32:12.498 --> 32:14.400
That why you run away?

32:15.701 --> 32:17.303
-Why'd you run away then?

32:17.303 --> 32:18.704
-I did bad.

32:18.704 --> 32:21.307
(door opens, closes)

32:21.307 --> 32:23.375
-Hi, Sheriff.
I'm Karen with Social Services.

32:23.375 --> 32:25.511
-Hi, Karen.
I'm Wade Houghton.

32:25.511 --> 32:29.015
This is my friend Sam
I told you about on the phone.

32:29.015 --> 32:30.716
-Who's that?
-Sam, this is Karen.

32:30.716 --> 32:32.618
She's a really sweet person,

32:32.618 --> 32:35.121
and she's gonna find you
a place to stay tonight, okay?

32:35.121 --> 32:36.989
No, I'm staying with you.

32:36.989 --> 32:40.126
-Uh... Yeah, um...
you can't stay with me, Sam,

32:40.126 --> 32:42.128
'cause there's rules
about that in this town.

32:42.128 --> 32:44.430
-(yelling) No!
-Sheriff, don't worry. -Okay.

32:44.430 --> 32:47.066
-Sheriff, I'll take it
from here. Okay.

32:47.066 --> 32:48.567
-Okay.

32:48.567 --> 32:51.603
Sam, she's-- I promise you,
she's really--

32:51.603 --> 32:53.372
she's gonna look after you,
okay?

32:53.372 --> 32:56.042
-I'm here to help. Okay?
-WADE: I'm really sorry.

32:56.042 --> 32:58.710
I gotta go, Sammy, okay?

32:58.710 --> 33:00.646
-It's okay.

33:02.514 --> 33:04.616
Okay?

33:04.616 --> 33:05.651
(crowd clamoring nearby)

33:05.651 --> 33:07.786
-Hey, Butch, what's up?

33:07.786 --> 33:11.290
-How you doing, Butch?

33:11.290 --> 33:13.292
-What up?

33:14.593 --> 33:16.395
-How you doing, man?

33:18.364 --> 33:20.366
-Hey, Christie.
-Hi, Butch.

33:24.236 --> 33:26.205
(man groaning)

33:26.205 --> 33:27.806
-What's up, my man?
-Hi, bro.

33:27.806 --> 33:30.209
-How you doing?
-He's cool. He's with me.

33:30.209 --> 33:32.144
-Go on in.

33:32.144 --> 33:33.445
-(crowd clamoring)
-(rap music playing)

33:33.445 --> 33:35.447
-Hey! What's happening?

33:46.292 --> 33:48.294
(crowd cheering)

33:54.533 --> 33:55.634
(whistle blows)

34:01.107 --> 34:02.474
-Bitches, leave.

34:02.474 --> 34:04.210
Out!

34:04.210 --> 34:07.513
Hustle, ladies, c'mon!
This ain't a health spa.

34:07.513 --> 34:09.315
Step lively, ladies, c'mon.

34:13.119 --> 34:16.455
-Not you, mountain man.

34:16.455 --> 34:17.723
Got something for you.

34:21.527 --> 34:23.562
Eye for an eye.

34:23.562 --> 34:27.299
A gift from the brotherhood.

34:27.299 --> 34:31.203
That shitskin called you
a dumb hillbilly hick.

34:31.203 --> 34:33.872
Tried to crack your skull open.

34:33.872 --> 34:36.175
He will try to kill you again.

34:36.175 --> 34:39.378
Only way to prevent that,
beat him to it.

34:41.447 --> 34:43.449
-Yeah, I'll take my chances.

34:43.449 --> 34:46.352
-He don't think of you
as a person.

34:46.352 --> 34:50.389
He'd gladly use this on you,
given the chance.

34:52.124 --> 34:53.359
You may be a good citizen

34:53.359 --> 34:55.361
up there on the mountain,
Farrell.

34:55.361 --> 34:56.862
But you're down here
in the hole now.

34:59.565 --> 35:02.801
Even Lucifer was an angel
'til he went to hell.

35:04.536 --> 35:06.338
-(muffled grunting)

35:06.338 --> 35:07.606
-(laughing)

35:08.640 --> 35:10.542
Hey, listen to him beg.

35:10.542 --> 35:13.345
That's a good scream.

35:13.345 --> 35:15.281
Don't that get
the juices flowin', huh?

35:15.281 --> 35:17.683
You sure you don't want
first shot at this animal?

35:17.683 --> 35:19.751
C'mon, try it.
It's easy.

35:19.751 --> 35:21.487
You just hold up hammer.

35:21.487 --> 35:22.488
Swing hammer.

35:23.489 --> 35:24.890
Okay.

35:24.890 --> 35:25.924
(yells)

35:25.924 --> 35:28.494
-(grunts)
-(laughs)

35:28.494 --> 35:30.396
See, told you it was easy.

35:30.396 --> 35:31.897
Pick up hammer,
swing that hammer.

35:31.897 --> 35:35.334
-Yeah.
Let me get that thing there.

35:36.735 --> 35:42.174
-I knew
there was that fire in ya.

35:42.174 --> 35:45.177
-Smash his skull
like a watermelon.

35:45.177 --> 35:46.812
That's it, brother.

35:46.812 --> 35:48.847
(clatters)

35:53.819 --> 35:56.788
You don't fool me, Farrell.

35:56.788 --> 36:00.459
There's a bloodthirsty
lion in you.

36:00.459 --> 36:02.294
I'll wager my life on it.

36:09.768 --> 36:12.504
-(thud)
-All right.

36:12.504 --> 36:15.607
Ho, ho, ho, ho.

36:15.607 --> 36:16.608
All right.

36:18.977 --> 36:20.546
(grunts)

36:21.713 --> 36:24.916
(chuckles) Bring me wine.

36:26.685 --> 36:28.820
Hey.

36:28.820 --> 36:33.592
-You think maybe you might wanna
make this the last one?

36:33.592 --> 36:37.396
-Thanks.
I already got a wife.

36:37.396 --> 36:38.630
And I love her.

36:40.232 --> 36:41.333
Goddamn me.

36:43.735 --> 36:46.672
Oh, it's like a trap.

36:46.672 --> 36:49.308
I know it's out there
and I just-- I keep...

36:50.476 --> 36:51.777
fallin' in it.

36:51.777 --> 36:55.414
-I am sure she loves you, too,
Foster.

36:55.414 --> 36:57.949
(laughter)

36:57.949 --> 36:59.318
-What the hell you know?

37:01.653 --> 37:03.422
Huh?

37:03.422 --> 37:05.624
What d'you know?

37:05.624 --> 37:10.028
More I do for her,
more she pushes me away.

37:10.028 --> 37:16.034
Hell, I wanted to go
and look for Lil Foster

37:16.034 --> 37:17.636
but I stayed here!

37:17.636 --> 37:21.340
I stayed here for her.

37:23.342 --> 37:25.311
For her.

37:25.311 --> 37:26.312
(frustrated yell)

37:26.312 --> 37:28.314
All right?

37:29.648 --> 37:31.450
Oh, shove it!

37:31.450 --> 37:34.753
I'm gonna... I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go find my son.

37:36.755 --> 37:37.756
-It's okay. He's--

37:37.756 --> 37:39.558
-It's pitch black!

37:39.558 --> 37:41.693
You're gonna kill yourself
going down.

37:47.299 --> 37:49.601
-He should sleep it off.

37:49.601 --> 37:50.636
C'mon.

38:23.502 --> 38:25.971
(glass breaking)

38:55.967 --> 38:58.970
*

39:18.156 --> 39:19.758
(crowd noise)

39:37.809 --> 39:40.045
Yeah, big boy! Come here.

39:40.045 --> 39:41.413
The winner!

39:41.413 --> 39:42.614
Yeah!

39:42.614 --> 39:43.649
-Good job, boy!

39:43.649 --> 39:45.951
-Yeah, all right!

39:45.951 --> 39:48.687
-Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo!

39:48.687 --> 39:52.558
Thank you all for coming
out to another fantastic night

39:52.558 --> 39:56.194
of the best freelance fightin'
in all of Eastern Kentucky.

39:56.194 --> 39:57.796
Now, remember to check
your texts

39:57.796 --> 40:00.031
for the date and location
of our next event.

40:00.031 --> 40:02.568
Until then...
(punching noises)

40:02.568 --> 40:05.437
Keep swinging, y'all.

40:05.437 --> 40:06.672
Pay up, boys.

40:06.672 --> 40:07.706
Here we go.

40:07.706 --> 40:09.708
(rap music playing)

40:16.147 --> 40:18.517
-You ready?

40:18.517 --> 40:19.718
-I can do that.

40:22.488 --> 40:23.522
-Now you're talkin'.

40:29.027 --> 40:30.829
-Dad!
-Caleb!

40:33.031 --> 40:36.868
Hey, Cay, Cay.
You okay?

40:36.868 --> 40:38.737
-Something bad
happened to Kitty.

40:38.737 --> 40:40.939
-No, no, no, no.
Come here.

40:42.173 --> 40:43.575
You just had a bad dream.

40:43.575 --> 40:44.710
It's okay.

40:44.710 --> 40:46.812
You wanna know a secret?

40:46.812 --> 40:49.047
I know how to get rid
of bad dreams.

40:49.047 --> 40:50.816
You ready?

40:50.816 --> 40:52.551
Come here.

40:52.551 --> 40:54.185
Now, you stay very still.

40:54.185 --> 40:57.523
(grunts softly)

40:58.924 --> 40:59.991
There we go.

41:01.860 --> 41:04.229
(gulps)

41:04.229 --> 41:07.999
See, so it's pretty much gone,
yeah?

41:07.999 --> 41:10.869
Just close your eyes,
it's okay.

41:10.869 --> 41:12.203
It's all right.

41:12.203 --> 41:13.772
I love you, buddy.

41:56.181 --> 41:57.916
-Hello?
Sheriff's Department.

41:59.718 --> 42:01.052
Sheriff's Department.

42:09.127 --> 42:11.763
(sniffing loudly)

42:14.566 --> 42:17.102
(gasping)

42:31.082 --> 42:32.083
-Where you been?
-(groans)

42:33.251 --> 42:34.653
I been looking for you
all night.

42:34.653 --> 42:35.654
I heard you weren't here
so I waited--

42:35.654 --> 42:37.088
-Slow down.

42:37.088 --> 42:39.024
I got enough pounding
in my head.

42:39.024 --> 42:39.891
What's happened?

42:39.891 --> 42:43.194
-Morgan killed Hezzy.
You were right.

42:43.194 --> 42:45.631
It took me most of the night
screwing up my pride

42:45.631 --> 42:46.798
to come get you.

42:46.798 --> 42:49.134
But she's up to something.
She's gotta go.

42:51.737 --> 42:53.071
I need you by my side.

42:53.071 --> 42:56.374
-Where I should have been
all this time.

42:56.374 --> 42:57.643
-Will you help me?

42:59.711 --> 43:00.979
-Always.

43:19.698 --> 43:20.899
-Good morrow.

43:20.899 --> 43:23.802
-Go back to the shadow side,
Morgan.

43:23.802 --> 43:24.903
-Anon.

43:24.903 --> 43:27.038
(Big Foster groans)

43:27.038 --> 43:28.273
-After tomorrow's moon,

43:28.273 --> 43:29.875
my Kinnah and I will be gone
from this place.

43:29.875 --> 43:32.010
-No, you and your skags,
you pack up now.

43:32.010 --> 43:33.645
Where are they?

43:33.645 --> 43:35.346
-'Tis joyous that
the old Bren'in will be here

43:35.346 --> 43:36.915
for what is to come.

43:36.915 --> 43:38.083
To see how the mountain
be preserved

43:38.083 --> 43:39.685
by one with true wisdom.

43:39.685 --> 43:41.720
-Yeah? Well, your Bren'in
gave you a command.

43:41.720 --> 43:44.055
Get the hell outta here!

43:51.429 --> 43:55.767
-Thou art not our Bren'in
for we are not Farrell.

43:59.337 --> 44:00.906
(shrill cry)

44:19.891 --> 44:21.059
(gun firing)

44:21.059 --> 44:24.062
(screaming)

44:27.833 --> 44:30.702
-No, no, no.

44:30.702 --> 44:32.771
-(speaking native language)

44:32.771 --> 44:33.805
(suspenseful music)
