01:26.000 --> 01:27.080
Morning.

01:27.216 --> 01:29.877
Lovely morning.
- Not bad

01:30.811 --> 01:32.785
Banks never on time, are they?

01:33.010 --> 01:35.661
No, no, they're desperate.
Desperate.

01:36.923 --> 01:38.062
Desperate altogether.

01:38.065 --> 01:39.920
Try another branch.

01:46.348 --> 01:49.032
Morning.
Like to make a withdrawal, please.

02:02.891 --> 02:05.062
Harrison will defend
the bail application,

02:05.322 --> 02:06.948
maybe even take the trial.

02:07.210 --> 02:10.788
But he insists on
two thousand pounds in cash.

02:10.858 --> 02:12.068
For a morning's work?

02:12.170 --> 02:14.177
Up front.
As in now, before we go in.

02:14.281 --> 02:15.940
I see, he doesn't trust me.

02:16.619 --> 02:19.105
Here he is now,
Michael, he's worth it.

02:21.533 --> 02:23.660
Morning.
- Morning

02:23.850 --> 02:25.736
It's nearly time.

02:25.800 --> 02:27.142
Are we in funds?

02:27.945 --> 02:28.893
Huh?

02:28.968 --> 02:32.481
Oh, the cash.
Just been to the bank.

02:32.585 --> 02:36.195
No... not here, Mr. Lynch.

02:36.295 --> 02:40.124
And you will be taking that off
in court, won't you?

02:40.231 --> 02:42.980
The prosecution's claim that
they fear my client

02:43.078 --> 02:44.289
might leave this country
while on bail,

02:44.390 --> 02:48.862
is completely and totally
without foundation.

02:48.933 --> 02:51.868
Especially when Mr. Lynch's
lovely little daughter, Breda

02:51.942 --> 02:54.276
is having her
first Holy Communion soon

02:54.374 --> 02:57.188
and it would be tragic

02:57.253 --> 03:01.115
if her father were not
to be with her on that day.

03:01.220 --> 03:02.497
So, Your Honour,

03:02.564 --> 03:07.321
the State can find no course
in law or in justice

03:07.397 --> 03:11.652
why this clean-living unassuming --

03:11.749 --> 03:14.431
teetotaler should have
his bail rescinded.

03:14.532 --> 03:16.604
Mr. Lynch may remain on bail

03:16.707 --> 03:19.390
until his trial commences
two weeks on Monday.

03:19.491 --> 03:22.337
Mr. Lynch, how does it feel to be
the most wanted man in Ireland?

03:22.434 --> 03:24.671
Do you think
you'll get a fair trial?

03:24.931 --> 03:27.581
Mr. Lynch, you enjoy making
the Gardai look thick, don't you?

03:27.811 --> 03:30.231
Hold... a minute, lads...

03:30.305 --> 03:31.865
don't ever think the Gardas
are thick, you'd be wrong.

03:31.937 --> 03:36.160
It'd be a big mistake.
The Gardas are anything but thick.

03:36.417 --> 03:37.911
In fact, I think the Gardas are
very, very clever.

03:38.018 --> 03:39.098
Is your name Michael Patrick Lynch?

03:39.330 --> 03:41.304
You see, right there,
an example of brains. You see?

03:41.410 --> 03:42.686
Excuse me, I am Mr. Lynch's attorney
and I object very much...

03:42.753 --> 03:45.174
I'm detaining you on suspicion of
possessing illegal substances,

03:45.280 --> 03:47.517
under the Misuse of Drugs Act.

03:47.617 --> 03:48.926
I know what you want to do.

03:49.025 --> 03:51.032
You want to strip search me,
don't you?

03:51.136 --> 03:53.240
Please, let go of him.
This man is my client.

03:53.343 --> 03:55.066
Oh, I see, you think
you'll humble me, do you?

03:55.167 --> 03:57.557
Oh, no...! Look at them!
Look at what I have to put up with!

03:57.665 --> 03:59.803
Look at what they do
to innocent people.

03:59.871 --> 04:02.653
Trying to grab a feel.
Trying to grab me balls, you queer.

04:02.720 --> 04:05.207
You dirty perverts,
trying to get your rocks off.

04:05.311 --> 04:06.653
Drugs? What drugs?

04:06.751 --> 04:09.019
I've never done drugs in me life
and everyone knows it.

04:09.118 --> 04:10.711
Show them your credentials, Mike.

04:10.942 --> 04:11.891
Find the drugs.

04:11.998 --> 04:14.137
Give us a look, get them off.

04:16.285 --> 04:19.132
Find the drugs. Come on,
put your fucking hand up my hole,

04:19.197 --> 04:19.961
you poofters.

04:20.060 --> 04:21.206
Come on.

04:22.430 --> 04:23.541
Show 'em your credentials, Michael.

04:23.645 --> 04:25.979
Hey, you fucking faggots.
What are you afraid of?

04:26.044 --> 04:28.695
You do it in private,
but not here, you fuckers.

04:33.723 --> 04:35.130
Do you want any more, love?

04:35.195 --> 04:38.043
I'm grand unless there's dessert?

04:38.107 --> 04:39.154
Of course there is.

04:39.227 --> 04:42.041
Is that you in the newspaper da?

04:44.922 --> 04:45.870
Oh, can I finish that?

04:45.978 --> 04:47.700
Yeah, waste not, want not. Thanks.

04:47.769 --> 04:50.486
Oh, God, Michael, give it to me.
Give it to me.

04:50.585 --> 04:53.651
You know the way
all that red meat makes him hyper.

04:53.754 --> 04:55.160
Sorry, sorry wasn't thinking.

04:55.256 --> 04:56.685
Your father first.
Who earns the money in this house?

04:56.952 --> 04:57.999
Da does.

04:58.104 --> 04:59.282
They're all grand.
There's enough for everyone.

04:59.384 --> 05:00.977
They have to learn.

05:01.081 --> 05:02.804
you just better go to bed
when you're told tonight.

05:02.904 --> 05:04.081
Okay, mum.

05:07.896 --> 05:09.456
Have you got Lynch with you, lads?

05:09.560 --> 05:10.835
Check. We have him in our sights.

05:10.934 --> 05:12.428
Clothes on or off today?

05:12.502 --> 05:13.712
Fuck off.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.341
She's great.

05:19.477 --> 05:21.997
Say hello to your da.
Go on. Found him.

05:22.101 --> 05:22.995
Is that them, huh?

05:23.061 --> 05:24.141
Is that the two sisters?

05:24.245 --> 05:25.838
Oh, that's them all right, boy.

05:25.941 --> 05:28.755
Bet he was glad he didn't have to
choose between them, huh?

05:29.172 --> 05:32.019
Why choose
when you can have both, boy?

05:32.084 --> 05:33.710
Mind your mothers now.
Do what they tell you.

05:33.813 --> 05:35.055
See you tonight.

05:35.699 --> 05:36.560
See you.

05:37.044 --> 05:38.932
I'll call round later,
collect the kids, yeah?

05:40.756 --> 05:42.664
Hey, Tommy, get off the bleeding
bike, come on.

05:42.771 --> 05:43.502
Oh, come on, can I stay on?

05:43.603 --> 05:45.294
You know I can't take you
without a helmet.

05:45.395 --> 05:47.762
Please Auntie Lisa...
Come on, just one go.

05:47.860 --> 05:48.907
Come on then,
say goodbye to your da.

05:49.011 --> 05:50.287
Bye, da.

05:50.354 --> 05:52.558
Wave him goodbye.

05:56.178 --> 05:59.755
Look at daddy
going round and round.

05:59.825 --> 06:01.614
Say goodbye.

06:05.105 --> 06:08.846
Jesus, there's no way he can
shake us off, not out here anyway.

06:08.944 --> 06:10.853
So what's the point?

06:22.415 --> 06:25.862
Jesus. We're running very low
on petrol, Barry.

06:26.478 --> 06:28.071
Control where's
the nearest service station?

06:28.142 --> 06:30.597
Con's very worried about
the petrol situation.

06:30.703 --> 06:31.564
He's getting out.

06:31.663 --> 06:32.939
Okay, lads,
I'll be right back to you.

06:33.038 --> 06:34.565
We're off.

06:38.030 --> 06:40.331
Right, lads,
the nearest petrol station's

06:40.557 --> 06:41.767
a good ten miles away, maybe more.

06:41.837 --> 06:42.731
Oh, Jesus.

06:42.797 --> 06:44.968
North east of the Bray Road.
Turn left for Bray.

06:45.069 --> 06:47.818
There's an Esso on the left,
about three miles outside the town.

06:47.884 --> 06:48.866
Keep in touch.

06:49.100 --> 06:50.791
I don't believe this.

06:51.052 --> 06:55.143
Ah for fuck, I told you
stop for petrol, didn't I?

06:55.211 --> 06:57.764
But, no, you said,
''We're fine, Con''.

06:57.867 --> 07:00.682
Look at him.
Sure, give him a wave, you wander.

07:31.368 --> 07:33.026
Where would you be
without the social welfare, huh?

07:33.287 --> 07:35.491
I couldn't agree more, Michael.
A vital few bob.

07:35.591 --> 07:36.867
Tony Brady.

07:37.127 --> 07:39.396
It's the difference between eating
and not eating sometimes.

07:39.464 --> 07:42.146
You said it, Tony. Good luck.

07:43.303 --> 07:44.830
Later.

07:45.255 --> 07:47.622
Michael Lynch.
And how are you today?

07:47.719 --> 07:48.188
Fine thanks.

07:55.462 --> 07:56.029
There you go.

07:56.262 --> 07:57.471
You're a gentleman
do you know that?

07:57.541 --> 07:58.556
Thank you.

07:58.662 --> 08:01.083
It's fellas like you
make the world go around.

08:06.052 --> 08:08.321
Right, we've caught up with Lynch.

08:08.420 --> 08:11.649
Told you he wouldn't miss out
on collecting his precious dole.

08:11.972 --> 08:13.051
Well, don't lose him this time.

08:13.155 --> 08:15.043
Oh, don't worry,
we're up his hole, Control.

08:15.139 --> 08:16.513
And we've a full tank

08:16.611 --> 08:18.618
Mr. Lynch won't be getting away
from us again today.

08:18.723 --> 08:20.609
Right, lads, keep in touch.

08:23.362 --> 08:26.297
I'll say one thing for him,
he sticks to the speed limit.

08:42.688 --> 08:43.799
Don't fuck about.

08:43.904 --> 08:45.693
Yeah, no problem, Michael.

08:46.848 --> 08:48.637
You're a mess, little brother.

09:00.030 --> 09:01.755
Relax, we're just passing through!

09:01.855 --> 09:02.870
Fucking hell!

09:02.943 --> 09:03.891
Excuse me, ladies...

09:03.999 --> 09:06.300
say hello to my little friend.

09:28.412 --> 09:32.851
Ho... here we go. He's off.
Put your foot down there, Con.

09:33.115 --> 09:34.228
Something happening, Control.

09:34.331 --> 09:37.146
You're telling me. There's a report
of a robbery at the dole office.

09:37.211 --> 09:40.025
Oh, for fuck's sake, we're just
at the fucking dole office.

09:40.090 --> 09:40.592
What?

09:40.858 --> 09:42.713
Fuck it! What do we do now?

09:48.569 --> 09:49.878
I never promised you a story.

09:49.977 --> 09:50.642
You did!

09:50.746 --> 09:51.477
I did not.

09:51.577 --> 09:52.560
You did so, da!

09:52.634 --> 09:53.779
What did I tell you about lying?

09:53.882 --> 09:56.248
To lie to everyone
except you and ma.

09:56.313 --> 09:58.223
And us.

09:58.745 --> 10:00.371
Oh, yeah, and Auntie Lisa.

10:00.473 --> 10:03.406
And the whole family. You never
lie to anyone in the family.

10:05.240 --> 10:07.858
Tell us the story
about The Mansions, da.

10:07.960 --> 10:11.123
Yeah, da,
tell us about The Mansions.

10:12.951 --> 10:13.933
Fair enough.

10:14.039 --> 10:14.868
Do you want to hear
the whole thing?

10:14.967 --> 10:15.796
From the start.

10:15.895 --> 10:17.356
Okay.

10:18.007 --> 10:20.624
Long, long ago,
years ago before you were born

10:20.726 --> 10:23.214
and your ma and me and Auntie Lisa
were very young

10:23.318 --> 10:25.554
we all lived in a place
called The Mansions.

10:25.622 --> 10:28.076
All our grannies and grand-dads
and brothers

10:28.181 --> 10:31.214
and sisters and all our pals.
It was brilliant.

10:31.317 --> 10:33.935
It was like a big hotel...

10:34.037 --> 10:36.621
built specially for us
and all our mates.

10:37.172 --> 10:38.666
And when I was young,

10:38.772 --> 10:41.707
I used to think
God was smiling down on us.

10:41.813 --> 10:45.073
Putting a special glow around us
so we could do as we pleased.

10:45.140 --> 10:48.587
Go about our business with
no-one getting in our way.

10:48.660 --> 10:50.961
And that it would never change.

10:51.059 --> 10:52.881
Tell us about the bailiffs, da.

10:54.771 --> 10:56.080
All right, so.

10:57.203 --> 10:58.577
Do you know what bailiffs are?

10:58.642 --> 11:00.878
They're just like gods
but they're worse.

11:00.978 --> 11:02.538
Much worse.

11:04.594 --> 11:08.204
So... one day...
this was before you were born.

11:08.273 --> 11:11.339
I was coming home
after working hard all day.

11:11.921 --> 11:15.881
And I saw them -- the bailiffs
attacking our homes.

11:15.984 --> 11:19.083
Big bastards with hammers and
knives and all sorts of things.

11:19.183 --> 11:21.071
But that didn't stop me
when I saw what they were at.

11:21.168 --> 11:22.574
I went for them.

11:22.670 --> 11:23.947
We fought for hours.

11:24.431 --> 11:25.992
But there was too many altogether.

11:26.095 --> 11:27.950
So, your ma and me and Lisa

11:28.047 --> 11:30.729
we barricaded ourselves in
and we wouldn't come out.

11:30.798 --> 11:33.067
You're need gonna take our homes
away from us.

11:33.134 --> 11:34.660
And they couldn't get in,
no matter how hard they tried.

11:34.893 --> 11:37.991
They huffed and they puffed,
but it was no use.

11:39.117 --> 11:40.939
And all around us...

11:41.004 --> 11:42.892
we could hear
the screaming and wailing

11:42.957 --> 11:44.648
of our friends and neighbors

11:44.717 --> 11:47.585
as they tore their houses
to little pieces.

11:47.660 --> 11:49.733
Like savages they were.

11:50.380 --> 11:51.907
They tried everything

11:52.171 --> 11:53.731
but they didn't know me.

11:53.835 --> 11:55.461
I wouldn't budge.

11:55.563 --> 11:57.702
No matter if they brought the
whole place down around our ears.

11:57.931 --> 11:59.208
And then the Mayor came!

11:59.308 --> 12:01.063
That's right.

12:01.131 --> 12:03.749
They were so pissed off
they couldn't get the better of me

12:03.851 --> 12:07.647
the Lord Mayor of Dublin himself
come out to see your da.

12:08.011 --> 12:09.188
Mr. Lynch.

12:11.178 --> 12:12.126
Michael!

12:12.842 --> 12:17.477
Michael! Michael, please,
if you'll just hear me.

12:17.545 --> 12:19.105
Michael...

12:21.224 --> 12:23.080
Get on your knees!

12:23.145 --> 12:24.225
I'm pleading with you!

12:24.330 --> 12:25.987
I personally have been authorized

12:26.089 --> 12:29.766
to offer you these keys
to two houses.

12:29.833 --> 12:31.655
One for us and one for Auntie Lisa.

12:31.753 --> 12:33.475
And I made him promise...

12:33.576 --> 12:36.805
that no-one could ever take
our homes away from us again.

12:37.480 --> 12:39.171
And the Mayor said...

12:39.272 --> 12:43.646
Yes, I promise!

12:43.751 --> 12:46.817
So, I graciously
accepted their offer.

12:47.303 --> 12:50.171
I won. I beat them all.

12:50.246 --> 12:53.093
The bailiff and the Mayor
and the law.

12:53.157 --> 12:56.833
I was loyal.
And that's why I won.

12:57.477 --> 12:59.517
You see, the thing is...

12:59.589 --> 13:01.247
they'll never beat you...

13:01.349 --> 13:05.057
if you stick together
and stay loyal.

13:17.988 --> 13:19.929
Are they asleep?

13:22.147 --> 13:25.278
It's time
for the tickle man.

13:30.433 --> 13:31.382
See you tomorrow.

13:32.290 --> 13:33.238
'Night.

13:52.318 --> 13:53.180
Hiya, Michael.

13:53.278 --> 13:54.588
Hey, Shaun.

14:04.127 --> 14:05.076
You're late.

14:05.183 --> 14:06.710
Sorry, bedtime stories.

14:06.814 --> 14:08.952
God! The Mansions again.

14:09.054 --> 14:11.225
I bet that put 'em to sleep.

14:21.085 --> 14:22.514
Christine asked me to ask you

14:22.780 --> 14:25.747
would you mind looking
after Tom and Shane tomorrow.

14:25.852 --> 14:28.219
She has to go into town to
get Breda her first communion gear.

14:28.476 --> 14:29.883
No problem.

14:34.619 --> 14:35.764
Are you ready for this?

14:35.866 --> 14:37.328
Oh yeah.

14:40.282 --> 14:42.137
I missed you.

14:56.631 --> 14:59.152
Fuck them! Don't answer!

15:03.223 --> 15:06.419
No, gotta call Billy,
tell him what's happening.

15:07.542 --> 15:08.949
Jesus! Fuck 'em!

15:13.622 --> 15:14.963
Who was with you at the bank?

15:15.030 --> 15:16.240
It was Stevie.

15:16.502 --> 15:18.922
No, no. Did Stevie drive the car?

15:18.997 --> 15:20.884
Stevie drove the car, right?

15:20.949 --> 15:21.897
That's right.

15:22.165 --> 15:23.594
And Tony Brady was with you, yeah?

15:23.700 --> 15:25.489
You see,
we know what you did, Lynch,

15:25.557 --> 15:27.563
doing jobs
while you're out on bail.

15:27.636 --> 15:29.523
And we have proof boy.

15:31.156 --> 15:37.265
All you have to do is say,
''Yes, that's just the way it was''.

15:39.411 --> 15:40.938
You drove to the courts
on a motorbike

15:41.042 --> 15:43.463
and then you switched
at the last moment, right?

15:43.538 --> 15:46.288
Fifteen minutes,
that's easy on a bike, Lynch.

15:46.706 --> 15:47.819
Give us an answer,
you fucking gobshite!

15:48.051 --> 15:49.992
All right, Con. Take it easy.

15:50.098 --> 15:52.912
Shall we start all over again,
shall we?

15:53.009 --> 15:55.879
You weren't with either of
your two wives Monday night

15:55.985 --> 15:57.195
we know that much.

15:57.297 --> 16:00.744
So, Michael, if you weren't
with the two ugly sisters

16:00.848 --> 16:04.077
don't tell me you were off
banging some other old slag?

16:29.645 --> 16:31.718
I realize you're not a golfing man,
Detective Sergeant

16:31.821 --> 16:35.052
but...
the Association of Inspectors

16:35.119 --> 16:37.256
and Superintendents Annual
Four Ball

16:37.325 --> 16:38.307
had to be cancelled today.

16:38.414 --> 16:41.261
Now, why do you think
it had to be cancelled?

16:41.357 --> 16:43.048
Well, I did mention to you, sir,

16:43.118 --> 16:44.939
that things like this usually
happen when we try to inter...

16:45.037 --> 16:46.946
Don't be the smart Alec with me,
Noel.

16:47.053 --> 16:48.231
I haev to tell you,

16:48.461 --> 16:50.632
there's a lot of very unhappy
golfers here today.

16:50.700 --> 16:53.699
This is vital rest and recreation
for senior officers.

16:53.804 --> 16:56.389
Do you understand the importance
of this, Detective Sergeant?

16:56.459 --> 16:57.539
Well I do now, sir.

16:57.612 --> 17:00.100
Are you trying to tell me
''I told you so''?

17:00.524 --> 17:03.043
I'll tell you someting,
Detective Sergeant...

17:03.146 --> 17:05.896
I will not have
the reputation of the Garda...

17:05.962 --> 17:09.823
brought into disrepute
by these shenanigans.

17:09.930 --> 17:13.474
We will not be intimidated
by the likes of Michael Lynch.

17:13.578 --> 17:16.359
Are you listening to me now?

17:16.457 --> 17:17.602
Christine wasn't upset, was she?

17:17.673 --> 17:19.266
No, no, she's fine.

17:20.680 --> 17:22.108
You see, every time
you go out on the road

17:22.217 --> 17:23.263
there's dangers out there

17:23.368 --> 17:26.271
bits of glass lying in wait nails,
pot-holes.

17:26.376 --> 17:28.067
So you have to watch out,
watch your every move

17:28.169 --> 17:32.292
coos otherwise they'll get you.

17:32.551 --> 17:33.861
Who?

17:34.471 --> 17:36.032
The bits of glass and that.

17:36.135 --> 17:38.819
Sooner or later,
if you're not careful

17:38.888 --> 17:41.538
and then you get a puncture
and then you're fucked.

17:41.607 --> 17:43.200
And then you fix it for me.

17:43.302 --> 17:46.750
Yeah, I do.
Aren't you a clever little shite.

17:47.527 --> 17:49.915
Can I put the patch on now?

17:49.990 --> 17:51.419
Don't wrinkle it.

17:51.525 --> 17:53.314
Job's worth doing.

17:55.781 --> 17:58.846
If a job's worth doing,
it's worth doing well.

17:59.493 --> 18:01.347
That's right... cool.

18:10.179 --> 18:11.390
That'll be the best way to park.

18:11.491 --> 18:13.312
Fucking brilliant parking that was.

18:13.410 --> 18:16.061
Shit!
A beaut.

18:16.163 --> 18:18.618
Hey, Tony, you drive like
a bleeding old woman.

18:24.769 --> 18:28.248
Fucking comedian...

18:28.353 --> 18:30.142
Mad fuck.

18:40.959 --> 18:42.105
Michael...

18:42.944 --> 18:45.463
...the new fella, Shay Kirby...

18:45.567 --> 18:47.127
doesn't bother you
he used to be in the IRA?

18:47.391 --> 18:48.984
Nah, he's out a couple of years.

18:49.055 --> 18:50.778
A bit doggy though, isn't it?

18:50.846 --> 18:51.892
Look, why are you bringing him in?

18:52.157 --> 18:54.262
He's the inside man on the job
I'm gonna tell you about.

18:54.366 --> 18:56.122
Look, I understand.

18:56.222 --> 18:58.360
While I'm talking I'll make
some crack about the Provos,

18:58.462 --> 18:59.508
you watch how he reacts.

18:59.613 --> 19:01.303
Tommy, come on, we're going.

19:01.404 --> 19:02.298
Say goodbye to daddy.

19:02.397 --> 19:03.160
Bue-bye, da.

19:03.261 --> 19:04.155
By, chicken.

19:04.221 --> 19:05.235
Bye lads.

19:05.340 --> 19:06.748
Bye.

19:06.846 --> 19:08.055
Bye, da.

19:09.244 --> 19:10.870
All right, sitting down, lads.

19:11.580 --> 19:12.474
One more round, Michael?

19:12.540 --> 19:13.850
Little fella, sit down.

19:13.948 --> 19:15.289
All right...

19:16.540 --> 19:19.027
First, you've all met Shay Kirby.

19:19.131 --> 19:20.243
How's it going?

19:21.531 --> 19:22.959
Now, as you know...

19:23.067 --> 19:26.995
I may be a bit occupied in the
Four Courts come Monday week.

19:27.099 --> 19:29.073
Now, should go okay,
but you never know.

19:29.179 --> 19:30.901
So I thought maybe now is the time

19:31.001 --> 19:32.179
for a job I've been thinking about
the last few months.

19:32.281 --> 19:34.616
One of those impossible ones.

19:34.713 --> 19:37.364
Now, this is one the IRA
had their piggy little eyes on

19:37.433 --> 19:39.505
but even they thought
it couldn't be done.

19:39.577 --> 19:42.326
Well, lads, when I heard that
I thought to myself,

19:42.424 --> 19:44.661
we're gonna have to show
those dozy fuckers a thing or two

19:44.729 --> 19:48.306
about robbing
O'Donnell's jewellery factory.

19:48.376 --> 19:49.303
Jesus Christ, Michael.

19:49.367 --> 19:50.960
Bollocks, man!

19:51.063 --> 19:52.852
What I was thinking was...

19:52.951 --> 19:56.945
we wouldn't actually try to
break into the factory itself

19:57.047 --> 20:01.423
but we'd sort of drop in.

20:09.973 --> 20:12.078
Fuck. Jesus Christ!

20:22.101 --> 20:25.582
And then sort of camp
out in the yard

20:25.685 --> 20:29.645
until someone arrives to let us
in the next morning.

20:29.749 --> 20:30.993
And that someone...

20:31.092 --> 20:33.067
is Mr. Fintan Doorley
the General Manager.

20:33.172 --> 20:36.237
Like myself, very precise man.

20:36.339 --> 20:39.754
Fintan arrives
at five-to-eight every morning.

20:39.860 --> 20:42.761
Now, as a man
who likes and needs routine

20:42.835 --> 20:45.835
he will probably be
a bit surprised at what he sees.

20:53.682 --> 20:56.333
Good morning, Mr. Doorley.
We're here to steal your gold.

20:56.434 --> 20:57.840
Meet our esteemed leader.

20:57.938 --> 20:59.083
Good morning, staff.

20:59.185 --> 21:01.290
Identify yourselves.

21:05.232 --> 21:07.534
Once inside
they'll meet Tony, Tom and Billy

21:07.632 --> 21:09.836
who'll invite them
to step into the marquee.

21:09.936 --> 21:12.325
And lads... Politely, okay?

21:12.400 --> 21:13.741
As long as
they're doing us no harm,

21:13.808 --> 21:15.334
we won't do them any harm.

21:15.407 --> 21:17.382
Stop mucking around.
Do as you're told!

21:17.488 --> 21:19.048
You got that, Billy?

21:19.119 --> 21:19.947
What?

21:20.047 --> 21:21.061
Just get the people inside.

21:21.166 --> 21:23.076
Blow up the air bed, love,
I'l be in in a minute.

21:23.182 --> 21:24.110
That's enough out of you, Billy.

21:24.207 --> 21:25.613
Give us a kiss,
you big ride, you.

21:26.254 --> 21:27.912
Yeah, yeah. Okay, Michael.

21:38.668 --> 21:41.734
So that at quarter-to-nine,
we all drive back out again.

21:41.964 --> 21:43.371
And we can all relax

21:43.468 --> 21:46.728
because it will be some time before
anyone gets to call the Gardai.

21:49.291 --> 21:52.138
Now does everyone have a picture
of that in their minds?

21:53.098 --> 21:56.808
Because, lads, I promise...

21:56.874 --> 22:01.477
that's just the way
it's gonne be easy as pie.

22:04.489 --> 22:06.212
What age are you, Alec?

22:06.313 --> 22:08.417
What, ten years younger than me?

22:08.521 --> 22:09.765
Big difference.

22:10.152 --> 22:12.672
Then Tony and Michael,
add another ten years on to that.

22:13.065 --> 22:14.974
Now, when they were kids
they had fuck all.

22:15.080 --> 22:16.486
Ain't that right, Michael?

22:16.583 --> 22:17.183
We had each other.

22:17.415 --> 22:18.659
True.

22:19.847 --> 22:22.236
Now, I'm that much younger
so I got some stuff,

22:22.343 --> 22:24.131
but it was never the right stuff.

22:24.231 --> 22:25.376
What are you
shitting on about, man?

22:25.447 --> 22:27.235
Billy, Billy knows
what I'm talking about, don't you?

22:27.334 --> 22:28.678
No.

22:28.936 --> 22:30.277
For fuck's sake.

22:30.376 --> 22:32.797
What was the big thing
when you were eight, say?

22:32.872 --> 22:34.814
''Star Wars'', I suppose.
Is that what you mean?

22:34.919 --> 22:35.901
''Star Wars''.

22:36.008 --> 22:38.113
Now, I bet you got the proper
''Star Wars'' stuff.

22:38.215 --> 22:40.669
You know, the real toys.
What were they called?

22:40.774 --> 22:42.749
Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader,
I had all that shite, man.

22:42.854 --> 22:44.709
And it was the proper thing, yeah?
The official stuff?

22:44.774 --> 22:46.301
Yeah, so what?

22:46.406 --> 22:47.650
So, I never got that.

22:48.517 --> 22:50.241
But, sure, me da probably robbed
the fucking things anyway.

22:50.341 --> 22:51.454
It doesn't matter!

22:52.005 --> 22:54.307
My ma and da couldn't even rob
the proper thing.

22:55.780 --> 22:57.689
That's a fucking tragedy, Stevie.

22:58.756 --> 23:00.283
It is a fucking tragedy.

23:00.388 --> 23:03.868
Fellas your age,
you got the proper thing.

23:03.971 --> 23:06.841
And now my kids want
every fucking thing that's going.

23:06.947 --> 23:08.289
And you're gonna use
all your money

23:08.388 --> 23:09.697
to make sure they get it.
Fair play to you.

23:09.763 --> 23:11.137
In me hole.

23:13.122 --> 23:15.227
I'm gonna make up for all the stuff
I missed out on.

23:15.330 --> 23:18.364
I'm gonna enjoy myself.

23:26.434 --> 23:27.862
Go ahead Tom.

23:29.313 --> 23:30.261
Right, Michael.

23:31.457 --> 23:33.846
Now, the depth of this door
is just right.

23:35.136 --> 23:38.365
Now, once that panel is removed
the bars sit in there,

23:38.432 --> 23:40.407
nice and snug.

23:40.512 --> 23:42.781
Now, if you have enough of them,
they don't rattle around.

23:45.311 --> 23:47.199
And you don't even notice
the extra weight

23:47.295 --> 23:49.531
when you're opening
and closing the door.

23:51.454 --> 23:54.487
Now this couple I've lined up
they're complete innocents

23:54.590 --> 23:55.800
that's the beauty of it

23:55.902 --> 23:57.625
no extra splits.

23:57.726 --> 23:59.580
They're just
old friends of me da's.

23:59.677 --> 24:02.841
Couple in their fifties
Mr. and Mrs. Harmless.

24:02.909 --> 24:04.185
And you know Customs...

24:04.253 --> 24:08.278
while they're busy searching
bearded ex-hippies in their 2CVs

24:08.380 --> 24:11.131
they'll be tipping
their hats at our pair

24:11.229 --> 24:12.658
as they chugger, chugger through

24:12.733 --> 24:14.391
at their usual
twenty-five miles an hour.

24:14.492 --> 24:16.859
Then they drive all the way over
to the Cotswolds.

24:16.956 --> 24:19.290
They've told me all about
this lovely hotel

24:19.356 --> 24:22.226
it's so quiet and peaceful that
they always go back every year.

24:24.603 --> 24:26.545
This is how I see it all happening,
Michael.

24:26.971 --> 24:30.004
It's not too far from Birmingham,
right,

24:30.075 --> 24:31.700
so I can fly in be at their hotel
inwhat, half an hour.

24:31.802 --> 24:35.152
They'll be there taking afternoon tea
completely unaware

24:35.227 --> 24:36.853
that they've a couple of
hundred thousand quids'

24:36.956 --> 24:39.027
worth of gold
sitting outside in the car.

24:44.666 --> 24:47.513
There'll be no more than,
what a dozen cars parked there

24:47.609 --> 24:50.097
no security, so getting
at the car'll be no problem.

24:50.169 --> 24:52.144
Bing, bang, boom. Get the gold

24:52.249 --> 24:53.143
bring it to the fence.

24:53.241 --> 24:55.379
Tom, it all sounds fine.

24:55.640 --> 24:57.582
I'll see you when you get back, so.

24:58.584 --> 25:02.412
Don't worry about it, Michael.
You can trust me.

25:06.519 --> 25:08.112
Hi, Uncle Billy.

25:09.559 --> 25:12.405
Come here to me, chicken.
Come here to me.

25:14.806 --> 25:15.788
Oh, look at you.

25:15.862 --> 25:17.966
My God,
are you an angel or a princess?

25:18.069 --> 25:18.931
Isn't she gorgeous?

25:19.029 --> 25:21.931
Come here to me. Tell me this would
that buy a few rosary beads eh?

25:23.573 --> 25:25.362
Come here.
What do you say to Mr. Higgins?

25:25.461 --> 25:25.929
Thank you.

25:26.036 --> 25:27.018
No problem, love.

25:27.252 --> 25:28.299
Good girl, good girl.
Now, come here to me, listen.

25:28.372 --> 25:29.201
Go on uupstairs, right,

25:29.300 --> 25:30.248
and I'll be with you
in a few minutes.

25:30.356 --> 25:31.152
All right, chicken, go on.

25:31.252 --> 25:33.227
Save us a dance, love,
will you?

25:36.019 --> 25:37.513
Who's your man there
with Billy?

25:37.619 --> 25:38.961
Higgins is his name.

25:39.411 --> 25:42.639
Grew up around here all right.
Went to college, you know.

25:42.706 --> 25:44.615
IRA I heard.

25:44.690 --> 25:48.105
Funny thing, he looks more like you
than your brother does.

25:48.178 --> 25:49.519
Same haircut anyway.

25:49.617 --> 25:50.828
Yeah, yeah.

25:53.330 --> 25:54.279
I'm telling you.

25:54.354 --> 25:56.110
Yeah, I know, I'm not gonna
fuck it up all right?

25:58.193 --> 25:59.272
Thanks for the lift.

25:59.345 --> 26:01.866
Da, da, look what granny gave me.

26:01.937 --> 26:03.082
What is it, chicken?

26:03.185 --> 26:06.567
It's a holy book
with lots of pictures.

26:06.672 --> 26:08.233
Oh, isn't that brilliant?

26:08.496 --> 26:10.187
What I'd give to
have a present like that.

26:12.112 --> 26:13.769
That's what I'd like to know
where did you come from?

26:13.871 --> 26:14.951
Guess.

26:15.215 --> 26:19.755
Mickey, you know that job that
Tom was doing for you in England?

26:20.015 --> 26:21.509
Yeah.

26:21.582 --> 26:24.038
What I mean, Mike,
even though I always knew that

26:24.109 --> 26:26.892
Tom was a bit of a fucking eject
you know, he was sound.

26:26.989 --> 26:29.803
I mean, if you'd asked me
that's what I'd have told you.

26:32.109 --> 26:35.338
Looks like
he's done a runner and...

26:35.405 --> 26:37.477
there's no car and there's no gold.

26:37.580 --> 26:39.271
Yeah.

26:40.365 --> 26:41.609
So what do you wanna do?

26:42.221 --> 26:44.609
Why the fuck did he think
he could get away with it?

26:44.684 --> 26:46.178
It's not like him,
I'll say that for him.

26:46.636 --> 26:49.157
And mind you, can you ever
trust anyone these days?

26:49.260 --> 26:51.649
Yeah, you can.
That's what it's all about.

26:51.724 --> 26:54.090
Wouldn't have asked him to
do the job if I didn't trust him.

26:56.683 --> 26:57.632
What now?

26:57.739 --> 26:59.495
You go find him. Bring him back.

26:59.595 --> 27:01.187
Okay.

27:01.290 --> 27:01.857
Tony...

27:01.962 --> 27:02.725
Yeah?

27:02.794 --> 27:04.801
You can finish your dinner first.

27:15.337 --> 27:17.508
Jesus, are you gonna queue up?

27:17.576 --> 27:20.609
I'll have to, won't I
unless you've any better ideas?

27:20.712 --> 27:23.046
Well, I can get you in there
no bother. Private tour.

27:23.304 --> 27:25.758
No, thanks,
I'll try the front door.

27:25.863 --> 27:27.423
Fair enough.
Listen, I've gotta go.

27:27.527 --> 27:29.731
Got this stupid fucking court thing
in half-an-hour.

27:29.799 --> 27:30.748
Enjoy yourself.

27:31.016 --> 27:32.869
I will.
You'll be all right, will you?

27:32.967 --> 27:34.211
Course.

27:40.710 --> 27:43.579
My Lord, may I request
an adjournment of proceedings

27:43.686 --> 27:44.579
until Wednesday?

27:44.678 --> 27:46.434
Application refused.

27:46.534 --> 27:47.809
but, my Lord, Mr. Harrison...

27:47.909 --> 27:53.092
the prosecution is ready,
the jury is ready, I am ready.

27:53.189 --> 27:57.498
Your client cannot avoid
the process of law indefinitely.

27:57.572 --> 28:00.801
Mr. McHale, are you ready to begin?

28:00.900 --> 28:02.209
Certainly, my Lord.

28:05.091 --> 28:08.058
Almost two years ago
on the nineteenth of February

28:08.323 --> 28:11.007
the defendant, Michael Lynch
and an unknown associate

28:11.234 --> 28:14.234
entered the premises of Superex
a video game company.

28:14.338 --> 28:16.313
They were armed and dangerous.

28:16.386 --> 28:18.590
They threatened the life
of a member of staff

28:18.690 --> 28:21.559
and stole over
thirty-two thousand pounds in cash.

28:23.905 --> 28:24.798
Listen, Michael...

28:26.689 --> 28:28.095
See this?

28:29.568 --> 28:30.461
Yeah?

28:31.008 --> 28:32.502
Can I hang it up in our room?

28:32.608 --> 28:34.364
What do you want
a holy picture for?

28:34.720 --> 28:36.922
It's not a holy picture,
it's a Caravaggio.

28:37.182 --> 28:38.426
He's about as holy as you are.

28:38.527 --> 28:39.989
Well, it looks like
a holy picture to me.

28:40.095 --> 28:41.557
Can I hang it up, or can't I?

28:42.175 --> 28:42.644
Of course.

28:42.910 --> 28:44.284
And you wont' be
slagging me about it?

28:44.350 --> 28:45.757
I promise.

28:46.527 --> 28:47.672
Grand.

28:51.038 --> 28:52.696
Can I go to the toilet, da?

28:52.797 --> 28:53.910
Of course.

28:55.390 --> 28:57.757
Do you get the feeling
I don't believe you, Tom?

28:58.556 --> 29:02.713
Please, Michael... please!
I swear...

29:02.813 --> 29:04.406
I mean, even if it is true,
these old ones

29:04.509 --> 29:06.483
got their car door
ripped off by a passing Land Rover

29:06.556 --> 29:08.596
and then left it abandoned
on the side of the road.

29:08.859 --> 29:11.314
I searched, Michael.
I drove up and down.

29:11.387 --> 29:14.551
I found the car and I even
put a new door on it an' all.

29:14.652 --> 29:19.027
I fucked up, you know,
and I was, I was afraid.

29:19.100 --> 29:21.783
So you don't think
I'm a fair man then, Tom?

29:22.523 --> 29:23.450
No.

29:23.866 --> 29:26.649
No, it's not, it's not that,
Michael, it's...

29:28.379 --> 29:33.047
Please, Michael...
I'm sorry, please.

29:34.202 --> 29:35.958
What did you do with the gold?

29:36.058 --> 29:37.781
Oh, God...

29:39.033 --> 29:41.007
I did nothing!

29:41.113 --> 29:43.862
I never got it, I never!

29:44.409 --> 29:47.223
It's gone. You have to believe me.

29:47.767 --> 29:49.077
But you ran away, Tom.

29:49.560 --> 29:51.981
Only scumbags run away.

29:52.088 --> 29:53.996
You can't trust someone
who does that, can you?

29:54.103 --> 29:55.564
I mean, would you trust them, Tom?
Would you?

29:55.831 --> 29:57.936
No, no, I wouldn't.

30:08.374 --> 30:11.221
So you see why this is a problem
I have to deal with, don't you?

30:11.286 --> 30:13.555
I mean, I can't leave it
hanging around, can I?

30:13.654 --> 30:14.636
Yeah, I know...

30:14.741 --> 30:16.083
Where's the gold?

30:16.182 --> 30:17.555
I don't know.

30:22.037 --> 30:23.411
What do you think?

30:23.636 --> 30:26.057
I don't know, Michael, I...

30:27.827 --> 30:31.472
I'm not certain...
or anything like...

30:31.540 --> 30:32.849
I'd nearly believe him, Michael.

30:32.948 --> 30:33.895
Yeah, I think you're right.

30:34.163 --> 30:37.163
His story is so stupid
it's probably true.

30:37.651 --> 30:39.178
All rigth, let him down.

30:42.770 --> 30:45.356
I'm sorry, Tom.
I believe your story now.

30:45.617 --> 30:47.919
Tony'll take you to the hospital.

30:48.626 --> 30:49.737
Oh, you're on the medical card,
aren't you?

30:49.808 --> 30:51.816
I mean this won't
cost you anything, will it?

30:51.889 --> 30:52.620
No.

30:52.689 --> 30:54.991
Grand, night. Lads.

30:58.737 --> 31:00.231
And will the accused sit up

31:00.305 --> 31:03.621
and let us see his face, please!

31:05.328 --> 31:08.110
The accused is a very clever man.

31:08.176 --> 31:10.893
But the extraordinary thing
about him

31:10.992 --> 31:13.096
is that he seems unable to resist

31:13.198 --> 31:16.581
letting the rest of the world
know how clever he is.

31:16.686 --> 31:18.574
sometimes I think
he's not a real criminal at all,

31:18.671 --> 31:21.125
he's just a big show-off.

31:33.196 --> 31:34.211
How are things, Michael?

31:34.316 --> 31:35.527
Fair, Shay.
What'll you have?

31:35.628 --> 31:36.838
No, I'm grand.

31:39.436 --> 31:40.897
Is everything all right,
Michael?

31:42.316 --> 31:43.876
Yeah, fine.

31:44.683 --> 31:49.669
Oh, it's just this...
there's this judge...

31:49.930 --> 31:51.785
he's getting on my nerves.

31:51.883 --> 31:55.265
He's prejudiced, you know.

31:55.337 --> 31:56.101
Is that right?

31:59.146 --> 32:02.822
That's his daughter's car.
Do you think you could find it?

32:03.849 --> 32:05.409
Consider it done.

32:08.200 --> 32:10.720
Trial's supposed to end
on Thursday

32:10.984 --> 32:13.886
will that give you enough time
to send them a bit of a message?

32:14.312 --> 32:15.327
A ''frightener''?

32:15.431 --> 32:19.074
It has to be timed just right.

32:19.878 --> 32:21.252
Give me the keys, love.

32:21.927 --> 32:23.007
Thanks for the lunch, sir...

32:23.110 --> 32:24.833
and a very stimulating
conversation.

32:28.262 --> 32:30.880
Bye, dad. Hope we didn't
outstay our welcome.

32:31.142 --> 32:32.385
Not at all, Moira.

32:32.485 --> 32:34.373
Mind you, he does like the osund of
his own voice, doesn't he?

32:34.437 --> 32:39.194
You're one to talk.

32:42.757 --> 32:44.546
In conclusion...

32:44.613 --> 32:46.849
whatever the jury's feelings
may be...

32:46.949 --> 32:51.999
as to what seems
the just conclusion to draw...

32:52.260 --> 32:54.333
I must remind you that...

32:54.435 --> 32:59.421
if the available evidence is not
sufficient for a conviction

32:59.524 --> 33:01.793
then...

33:02.787 --> 33:05.634
you must not convict.

33:08.898 --> 33:11.450
This is another disaster
for the Gardai, isn't it?

33:11.554 --> 33:13.081
Mr. Lynch has been found not guilty.

33:13.345 --> 33:15.233
That is not to say that the Gardai

33:15.330 --> 33:19.158
are pursuing anyone else
in connection with this crime.

33:19.265 --> 33:20.410
It's also not to say that

33:20.481 --> 33:22.335
the Gardai will
cease its investigations

33:22.401 --> 33:23.677
in the activities
of Mr. Michael Lynch.

33:24.257 --> 33:26.167
Do you think the justice system is
too soft on criminals, Michael?

33:26.273 --> 33:28.028
Michael, how can you afford such
an expensive legal team, Mr. Lynch?

33:28.129 --> 33:29.339
Are you back on the dole, Michael?

33:29.441 --> 33:31.896
Now that you're innocent,
can you show us your face?

33:31.969 --> 33:32.951
Daddy.

33:33.025 --> 33:34.454
There's daddy
with the black hood on him.

33:34.559 --> 33:35.639
That's right.

33:35.711 --> 33:36.889
Da, why are you wearing
a black hood?

33:36.991 --> 33:38.333
Cos, I don't want them to see me.

33:38.432 --> 33:41.149
...that Mr. Michael Lynch
is not a funny man.

33:41.216 --> 33:42.709
All right, now, kids, who is he?

33:42.782 --> 33:44.059
A Garda.

33:44.158 --> 33:45.086
Is he a pig, da?

33:45.183 --> 33:46.328
You're both right,
but you never call him a pig.

33:46.430 --> 33:47.324
Pay attention to him,
call him a Garda

33:47.423 --> 33:49.245
and never trust him
or anyone like him.

33:49.343 --> 33:51.447
Come on, play it, Michael.
Are me and Lisa in it?

33:51.710 --> 33:53.051
It's just a little bit
you have to watch

33:53.118 --> 33:53.979
it's in the, the beginning...

33:54.046 --> 33:55.901
Hey, that's us.We're famous.

33:55.966 --> 33:57.941
We're not the stars of the show,
of course.

33:58.045 --> 33:59.637
We'd only be like extras, you know.

34:00.924 --> 34:02.517
Will you go and play outside,
please.

34:02.621 --> 34:03.482
Are you going home?

34:03.581 --> 34:04.857
We've gotta go home in a minute.

34:05.116 --> 34:06.043
All right, come on,
we'll watch it again in a while.

34:06.139 --> 34:08.027
Get your coats.

34:13.978 --> 34:16.696
But it does seem that the Gardai
just can't control

34:16.795 --> 34:18.137
the spiral of crime
in the city right now.

34:18.203 --> 34:19.185
Does it?

34:32.538 --> 34:33.431
Billy.

34:34.106 --> 34:35.315
Billy!
How are youse?

34:35.418 --> 34:37.391
Billy, how are you?

34:37.849 --> 34:39.190
God, you're looking well tonight.

34:39.288 --> 34:41.110
I like the suit there, big fella.
Thanks. How are you doing?

34:41.208 --> 34:43.150
Right, fine.
How are you, Michael?

34:43.416 --> 34:45.139
Lisa and Christine, isn't it?

34:45.400 --> 34:47.636
Sorry, I'm not sure which is which.
Dark, you know.

34:47.735 --> 34:48.717
Who's that?

34:48.822 --> 34:51.125
It's Jerome Higgins.
He wants to talk to you.

34:51.190 --> 34:53.132
Jerome Higgins?

34:53.525 --> 34:55.981
Since when yhave you become
the messenger boy for the IRA,

34:56.087 --> 34:56.882
little fella?

34:56.983 --> 34:57.844
Talk to him, will you?

34:57.943 --> 34:59.797
A few minutes,
that's all, honestly,

34:59.894 --> 35:00.843
it's no trouble or anything.

35:03.798 --> 35:05.008
What's the problem, Michael?

35:05.078 --> 35:07.533
I don't like being told what to do,
that's the problem.

35:11.285 --> 35:12.529
It's grand.

35:14.677 --> 35:16.400
I won't be long. Okay?

35:16.468 --> 35:18.191
Billy.

35:20.147 --> 35:21.838
Conversing with the riff-raff.

35:22.515 --> 35:24.206
Glad our man, Shay Kirby,

35:24.307 --> 35:26.249
was able to help you out
with that Judge, Michael.

35:26.354 --> 35:27.783
Shay doesn't work with you
any more.

35:27.859 --> 35:30.793
But his training, Michael.
His methods.

35:30.898 --> 35:31.978
What are you looking for?

35:32.082 --> 35:33.456
Well, I was just saying
to Billy there

35:33.554 --> 35:35.212
that I think
there could be a lot of merit

35:35.313 --> 35:36.874
in a bit of co-operation
between us.

35:37.745 --> 35:39.174
Well, I don't.

35:39.249 --> 35:41.004
Billy wouldn't agree with you there

35:41.104 --> 35:43.493
and we've done a few favours
for your Billy.

35:43.569 --> 35:44.397
Now, I suppose you know that

35:44.496 --> 35:47.180
we had our eye on
O'Donnells Jewellery as well.

35:48.687 --> 35:49.319
Tough shite.

35:49.391 --> 35:52.173
Because we thought a reasonable
cut from the what?

35:52.239 --> 35:56.102
Two million, I believe, would be
a nice gesture to us, Michael.

35:56.368 --> 35:58.604
Call it a symbol
of future collaboration.

35:58.672 --> 36:01.606
How about a symbol
of future fuck all?

36:01.712 --> 36:03.272
You've neither the fucking brains

36:03.343 --> 36:04.292
or the gumption
to do your own robbing

36:04.366 --> 36:06.090
so you think
you can come around here

36:06.190 --> 36:07.336
and squeeze an ordinary
decent criminal, like me,

36:07.438 --> 36:09.260
who knows something about his job.

36:09.327 --> 36:12.325
Fuck off and double fuck off,
Jerome.

36:13.709 --> 36:14.986
Night, little fella.

36:15.661 --> 36:16.609
Excuse me.

36:18.669 --> 36:20.578
Oh, and,
no hard feelings by the way.

36:20.684 --> 36:21.862
God loves a trier

36:21.965 --> 36:23.623
and keep your eye on the papers,
Higgins...

36:23.725 --> 36:25.797
cos that'll be the first place
you hear about my next job

36:25.868 --> 36:27.210
when it's all over the front pages.

36:27.277 --> 36:29.481
The biggest yet.
Way out of your league.

36:29.580 --> 36:30.857
What job are you talking about,
Michael?

36:30.924 --> 36:32.331
Don't ask me, I'm making it up
as I go along.

36:49.675 --> 36:51.366
M, it's me.

36:56.427 --> 36:57.375
Hi, Michael.

36:58.410 --> 37:00.929
Look, I'm really sorry about that
you know. Look, I'm really...

37:01.033 --> 37:02.691
Christine!

37:03.785 --> 37:07.461
So, you got caught dealing and
now you're in hock to the IRA.

37:08.968 --> 37:10.626
You fucking spaz.

37:10.728 --> 37:12.616
I want you out of Dublin, fast,
little fella.

37:12.713 --> 37:14.535
England, the States,
I don't care where.

37:14.633 --> 37:17.218
But keep away from them
and keep away from me.

37:23.719 --> 37:25.508
I'm sorry, Michael.

37:59.236 --> 38:01.625
Mostly he enede up
doing religious painting

38:01.701 --> 38:04.482
but that's only cos that's
where the money was in those days.

38:04.580 --> 38:07.362
Cardinals and Bishops were
always hiring artists

38:07.460 --> 38:08.387
to paint scenes from the Bible.

38:08.643 --> 38:12.122
And Lords, of course, trying to
show of how holy they were.

38:12.611 --> 38:15.840
He had to do a runner out of Rome
for killing some fella in a fight.

38:15.906 --> 38:17.881
Bit of a fucking headcase,
do you know.

38:20.449 --> 38:22.271
Michael, this isn't right.

38:22.625 --> 38:25.494
Excuse me, my, my wife,
she needs to...

38:46.238 --> 38:47.765
See Jesus and Judas...

38:47.998 --> 38:51.259
Caravaggio used fellas
off the street as his models.

38:51.358 --> 38:53.845
He hung around bars and
whorehouses all the time

38:53.949 --> 38:57.364
picked out someone interesting
to be Jesus or whoever.

38:57.948 --> 38:59.803
I think he got a kick out of that,
you know...

38:59.901 --> 39:02.748
having Cardinals on their knees...

39:02.844 --> 39:05.843
praying away to some painting
of a murderer or something.

39:06.747 --> 39:08.602
What are you laughing at?

39:09.275 --> 39:10.420
Oh, nothing.

39:11.995 --> 39:14.001
I was just thinking about
what lasts, you know,

39:14.106 --> 39:14.934
and who gets the benefit.

39:15.898 --> 39:17.043
I mean, your man who painted this

39:17.114 --> 39:19.668
he never saw any of the money
it's supposed to be worth, right?

39:20.027 --> 39:21.652
But he gets the reputation though

39:21.723 --> 39:23.894
I mean, people remember who he is.

39:23.962 --> 39:25.904
And that's the thing, isn't it?

39:26.523 --> 39:28.857
You're afraid no-one'll
remember you after you're dead?

39:29.913 --> 39:31.735
I think
you should take up painting.

39:31.833 --> 39:33.491
Why? So I'll be remembered?

39:33.594 --> 39:35.186
Nah. So you could do the kitchen.

39:53.846 --> 39:54.774
Hello, yeah?

39:54.870 --> 39:56.146
Father Grogan?

39:56.246 --> 39:57.588
Paul Grogan, yes, that's me.

39:57.686 --> 39:59.345
My name's Christine.

39:59.446 --> 40:01.169
I phoned you about the Caravaggio.

40:01.269 --> 40:02.546
Oh, yes, of course.

40:02.613 --> 40:04.239
Come in, you're welcome.

40:04.821 --> 40:08.619
Oh, the painting was hanging
right down here for years

40:08.694 --> 40:11.214
looking down at everyone
having their supper

40:11.477 --> 40:14.477
and no-one took any notice of it.

40:14.581 --> 40:17.449
Getting dirtier and dirtier.

40:17.844 --> 40:23.561
Then one day I was celebrating Mass
in our little chapel upstairs

40:23.668 --> 40:26.034
remind me to show it to you
before you go.

40:26.131 --> 40:31.052
Anyway, this morning
it was Luke's wonderfully moving

40:31.155 --> 40:33.739
account of Veronica
washing the face of Jesus.

40:33.842 --> 40:38.032
And I thought, we must have
that beautiful painting cleaned.

40:38.290 --> 40:40.591
No idea
what was about to be uncovered

40:40.690 --> 40:42.380
a Caravaggio...

40:42.481 --> 40:44.139
I mean, a priceless original.

40:44.241 --> 40:46.096
It was a pity for us in a way,
of course,

40:46.193 --> 40:48.396
because it was lovely to
have it there.

40:48.464 --> 40:51.760
But, well...
as soon as we knew its value

40:51.856 --> 40:54.092
we knew it couldn't stay here.

40:54.160 --> 40:57.454
I mean any half decent thief
could just walk in.

40:57.519 --> 40:59.941
The gallery made us
that very fine copy though.

41:00.048 --> 41:01.095
Same size and all?

41:01.328 --> 41:03.270
Oh, yes, an absolute replica.

41:03.792 --> 41:05.646
Oh, I couldn't tell the difference.

41:05.711 --> 41:07.685
What about an art expert?

41:07.759 --> 41:10.345
Well, he or she
would spot it in seconds.

41:10.448 --> 41:12.039
If it really is
worth thirty million

41:12.110 --> 41:13.801
why didn't you sell it
to the gallery

41:13.870 --> 41:14.885
rather than giving it to them?

41:14.990 --> 41:18.220
Well, not blowing
our own trumpets now

41:18.318 --> 41:23.336
but I suppose we just thought
it was the right thing to do.

41:41.228 --> 41:43.170
Won't be long,
about ten minutes I suspect.

41:43.276 --> 41:44.802
Okay, lads, good luck.

42:22.087 --> 42:23.973
What the bloody hell's he doing?

43:01.219 --> 43:02.113
Get out of the car.

43:02.179 --> 43:03.804
Get out of the fucking car!

43:15.265 --> 43:16.858
Yes!

43:16.961 --> 43:18.716
Did you see their fucking faces?

43:20.352 --> 43:21.661
Raferty van, that's it, that's it.

43:21.728 --> 43:23.517
Get after him, Con.
Turn the car around, get her round!

43:23.584 --> 43:24.893
Shut up. I'm, like, doing it.

43:25.152 --> 43:26.809
Oh their tail.
We'll lose them, hurry up!

43:27.071 --> 43:28.664
Would you, for fuck's sake,
just shut up!

43:46.654 --> 43:47.865
Okay, we're up on them.

43:48.125 --> 43:49.686
Right, steady as you go, Con,
steady as you go now.

43:49.789 --> 43:50.356
Nice and handy.

43:50.461 --> 43:51.573
Fuck!

43:51.677 --> 43:53.532
The door's open, now's your chance.

43:53.629 --> 43:55.353
What's the fucking matter with you?
It's only a picture!

43:55.421 --> 43:58.169
Jesus Christ!
Come on.

44:07.322 --> 44:09.941
I knew we were a country
that respects art.

44:10.587 --> 44:12.496
Yes.

44:13.275 --> 44:15.576
You never mind if there's bastards
out there trying to get you.

44:15.642 --> 44:17.552
They're only satisfied
when they can grind you down,

44:17.626 --> 44:19.731
keep you poor, put you away.

44:19.801 --> 44:22.136
They don't count. Not with us.

44:22.202 --> 44:24.341
In fact, I think we can give them
the run around any time we like

44:24.601 --> 44:25.845
cos they're only eejits.

44:25.913 --> 44:27.474
Mentioning no names like.

44:27.578 --> 44:30.479
And this thing of me becoming
a bit of a TV star lately

44:30.585 --> 44:32.014
I want you all to know

44:32.280 --> 44:36.372
it's not gonna change me
one little bit.

44:36.761 --> 44:38.647
Come on,
I wanna show you something.

44:39.192 --> 44:40.883
We're top of the ratings, lads.

44:40.984 --> 44:42.129
They might even give us
our own series.

44:42.231 --> 44:46.867
...valuable painting Caravaggio,
''The Taking of Christ''

44:46.967 --> 44:47.250
was stolen in broad daylight

44:47.319 --> 44:50.865
by an unknown criminal gang
posing as American tourists.

44:50.967 --> 44:54.544
And none of them have
a fucking clue as to who did it.

44:56.246 --> 44:57.707
Oh, you wanna see the bum shot?

44:58.390 --> 45:00.463
What the fuck is a bum shot?

45:02.933 --> 45:04.559
Oh, Jesus.

45:06.325 --> 45:08.942
Look at that arse on you, man.

45:09.044 --> 45:10.986
Michael, the painting,
how are we gonna get rid of it?

45:11.092 --> 45:13.481
It's all sussed.

45:13.588 --> 45:15.082
Alec is going to Amsterdam
next week to see a fence.

45:15.348 --> 45:16.460
Let him make us an offer.

45:16.563 --> 45:19.912
But the crack is, in the meantime
while we're waiting for all of that

45:20.178 --> 45:22.251
we can just sit back
and watch the Gardai

45:22.355 --> 45:23.337
make a pig's mickey of it.

45:23.410 --> 45:25.319
I'll drink to that.

45:25.394 --> 45:28.460
Michael, any idea how much we'll
get for this holy picture here?

45:28.561 --> 45:30.765
Like, just cos
it's valued at thirty million.

45:30.833 --> 45:32.774
We'll get enough to get rich,
don't worry.

45:32.881 --> 45:35.052
The point is, we've won.

45:35.153 --> 45:38.449
I mean, you see ths,
you see all this?

45:38.513 --> 45:40.552
Think about what it means.

45:41.713 --> 45:44.266
We're number one,
not the Gardai

45:44.337 --> 45:46.758
not the IRA, not anyone else.

45:47.025 --> 45:49.609
The whole country is in awe of us.

45:49.712 --> 45:51.534
Because of a little divine
intervention here from...

45:51.632 --> 45:53.519
we're bigger than Riverdance.

45:55.120 --> 45:57.737
One day at a time...

45:57.807 --> 46:04.430
sweet Jesus,
that's all I'm asking of you

46:04.495 --> 46:12.164
Just give me the strength to
do everything that I have to do

46:12.238 --> 46:16.995
Yesterday's gone sweet Jesus

46:17.069 --> 46:21.673
And tomorrow may never be mine

46:28.460 --> 46:29.704
I think this is the signal.

46:29.772 --> 46:30.601
Watch... see?

46:30.699 --> 46:32.739
Spot on.

46:32.812 --> 46:34.983
Well, it's the signal itself
that got to me, sir.

46:35.051 --> 46:36.457
Well, you're right,
he's giving a signal but...

46:36.523 --> 46:38.345
he's imitating the painting, sir.

46:38.443 --> 46:40.330
Same as your man Judas there.

46:40.395 --> 46:41.737
Oh, right, very clever, but...

46:41.803 --> 46:43.689
Yeah, it's smart.

46:43.754 --> 46:47.463
Obviously someone that likes a gag.
Someone that likes a joke.

46:47.562 --> 46:49.831
That's what made me realise
it's Michael Lynch.

46:49.930 --> 46:51.970
We can't get a positive ID
from that picture, sir,

46:52.233 --> 46:55.430
but I did body size and shape
comparisons with Lynch and Brady.

46:55.498 --> 46:57.603
Heads, heights, everything,
they match.

46:57.706 --> 46:59.679
Very interesting, Noel, well doen.

47:00.137 --> 47:02.308
Good to see the gizmos being
put to use and so on,

47:02.376 --> 47:04.351
but it's a coincidence.

47:04.456 --> 47:06.049
Your nose alone
should tell you that

47:06.153 --> 47:08.224
Lynch is not capable of
this kind of thing.

47:08.295 --> 47:10.499
I went back over
some of the security videos

47:10.567 --> 47:11.495
from the art gallery, sir.
I found this.

47:11.560 --> 47:15.334
Lynch and his wife Christine
on a day out.

47:15.399 --> 47:16.741
I know it's not
evidence of anything, sir

47:16.807 --> 47:19.196
but what the fuck
is Michael Lynch doing

47:19.271 --> 47:20.961
at a seventeenth century
Italian art exhibition?

47:21.063 --> 47:23.233
My wife went to that exhibition!

47:23.334 --> 47:25.822
I'm sorry, but we'd look like fools

47:25.925 --> 47:28.129
presenting that idea
to the top lads in Interlope.

47:28.230 --> 47:30.847
If my training with the FBI
has taught me anything,

47:30.949 --> 47:32.542
it's these specialist robberies

47:32.644 --> 47:34.554
are the preserve of
a few international gangs.

47:34.660 --> 47:38.620
Germans, Dutch, art thieves that
really know their business.

47:38.724 --> 47:39.934
Come on, Noel, admit it.

47:40.164 --> 47:42.499
Lynch just isn't in that league.

47:48.003 --> 47:48.931
Behave yourself.

47:54.755 --> 47:56.664
Oh, charge it to room 764, please.

47:56.771 --> 47:59.869
No... Peter. In fairness you've
travelled a long way to meet us.

47:59.939 --> 48:01.465
You have to let me pay this time.

48:01.571 --> 48:03.544
Hey, you know it's no problem.

48:03.650 --> 48:04.632
You'll be paying
the hotel bill anyway.

48:04.706 --> 48:05.469
Hey, Alec, he's right.
He's fucking right.

48:05.537 --> 48:06.715
So we will.

48:06.818 --> 48:09.273
Hey, I like your style, Peter.

48:09.377 --> 48:11.199
Smart fella there.
I like that.

48:11.296 --> 48:12.889
Oh phone call. Won't be long.

48:12.993 --> 48:15.414
Hey, Peter, I think that slapper
over there has her eye on you.

48:15.488 --> 48:16.317
What's a slapper?

48:16.417 --> 48:19.165
Yeah... no, yeah, no,
half eleven's fine, yea...

48:19.231 --> 48:20.638
No... I'll be there, yeah...

48:20.735 --> 48:23.801
It's certainly not the MO
of any gang that we know.

48:23.871 --> 48:25.878
Which suggests very strongly that

48:25.950 --> 48:28.569
it's a very clever
local Irish operation.

48:28.670 --> 48:32.019
You've probably come to that
conclusion yourselves already.

48:32.095 --> 48:34.199
Oh yes, oh, indeed, aye.

48:35.422 --> 48:38.237
Well, of course we're
pretty confident at this stage

48:38.334 --> 48:41.333
that this is the work of
a gang led by Michael Lynch.

48:41.597 --> 48:43.801
Now, I'm personally familiar
with Lynch's MO

48:43.901 --> 48:46.683
and though normally art theft
isn't really histhing,

48:46.781 --> 48:49.627
this particular robbery seems to
have his mark on it all right.

48:51.259 --> 48:52.536
If you know who you're dealing with

48:52.636 --> 48:55.319
it will make a recovery operation
much easier.

48:56.892 --> 48:59.924
We know that someone here in Dublin

49:00.027 --> 49:02.929
has made contact with a fence
in Amsterdam.

49:03.003 --> 49:04.563
Let us call him Peter.

49:04.635 --> 49:06.227
Peter had made contact with us

49:06.490 --> 49:08.464
to offer his co-operation.

49:34.039 --> 49:35.762
Good afternoon, lads.

49:35.832 --> 49:36.333
All set?

49:36.440 --> 49:37.235
All ready, sir.

49:37.303 --> 49:38.317
Noel...

49:38.390 --> 49:39.601
Yes, sir?

49:40.151 --> 49:40.817
Get to work.

49:41.078 --> 49:42.006
Right away, sir.

49:48.950 --> 49:49.997
Whatever you do,

49:50.103 --> 49:51.215
don't say anything to him
about where you're taking him,

49:51.318 --> 49:52.910
or mention anything
about the painting at all.

49:53.014 --> 49:53.875
Okay.

49:53.942 --> 49:55.404
Not a word.

49:55.510 --> 49:56.458
I mean it. Good luck.

49:56.566 --> 49:57.744
See you there, Michael.

49:58.965 --> 50:01.234
Do you like art, generally?

50:01.301 --> 50:03.635
What do you think of the painting?

50:03.733 --> 50:07.115
Oh, I couldn't give a shite, man,
to be honest with you.

50:07.221 --> 50:10.351
Well, it's a beautiful Caravaggio,
isn't it?

50:12.468 --> 50:14.257
Well, of course I realize,

50:14.356 --> 50:17.617
well, I suppse that
money is your main interest.

50:20.435 --> 50:22.377
I can tell you,
you don't like to talk,

50:22.484 --> 50:24.458
you have no interest
in conversation.

50:24.562 --> 50:27.148
Not true. I love a good chat, man.

50:29.235 --> 50:31.919
So, these are the beautiful
Dublin mountains.

50:32.019 --> 50:33.098
Spotter plane.

50:33.202 --> 50:34.412
They've got it, sir.

50:35.090 --> 50:36.039
All right.

50:37.266 --> 50:38.990
Let's hope
the weather remains fine,

50:39.091 --> 50:40.878
especially if
we have to view outdoors.

50:49.201 --> 50:50.128
Where do you want it?

50:50.321 --> 50:51.433
The Caravaggio?

50:51.537 --> 50:52.617
Upright somewhere.

50:52.720 --> 50:53.614
Lean it against the tree there.

50:53.680 --> 50:55.142
It's so strange to be standing on
a wooded mountain top

50:55.248 --> 51:00.266
looking at one of the great
marvels of Renaissance art.

51:00.368 --> 51:02.921
''The Taking Of Christ'',
by Caravaggio.

51:07.696 --> 51:09.452
What are you shouting for?

51:13.422 --> 51:14.535
Oh, sorry, was I?

51:15.535 --> 51:19.113
A little excited perhaps.
After all, this is a...

51:23.021 --> 51:25.923
Right. So, tell me, are you happy
with your examination?

51:26.030 --> 51:28.549
Yes, very happy.

51:28.973 --> 51:32.518
Right then, lads, follow me.

51:34.221 --> 51:35.649
Back to Roundwood okay?

51:36.748 --> 51:38.657
Roundwood. Got him.

51:38.764 --> 51:40.520
Units 2,3 and 6, Roundwood.

51:40.619 --> 51:45.059
I want a complete roadblock.
All roads in. All roads out.

51:46.666 --> 51:48.935
All units to Roundwood...

51:49.866 --> 51:51.840
Copy that, control.
Unit 6 on our way to Roundwood.

51:52.906 --> 51:55.327
Unit 5, how far away are you?

51:55.401 --> 51:57.889
Isn't the scenery around here
only fantastic Peter?

51:58.122 --> 52:01.416
Of course, you've no mountains
in Holland, sure you haven't.

52:01.961 --> 52:04.099
No, very flat Holland.

52:07.399 --> 52:09.374
I love your country very much.

52:10.151 --> 52:11.296
Same here, Peter.

52:11.560 --> 52:13.862
Ireland's a great place to live,
do you know that?

52:14.440 --> 52:15.780
Are we near Roundwood yet?

52:16.359 --> 52:17.504
About half a mile.

52:17.958 --> 52:19.868
As soon as we get off this road
we're as good as there.

52:19.943 --> 52:22.114
Fantastic.
We might stop for a pint, will we?

52:22.182 --> 52:23.490
Are you thirsty?

52:23.589 --> 52:25.411
The cheek of the man.

52:28.965 --> 52:29.980
Are they in position yet?

52:30.085 --> 52:32.451
I want that roadlock rock solid
do you hear me?

52:32.708 --> 52:34.880
Mothing repeat,
nothing is to get through.

52:35.268 --> 52:37.243
Unit 6, call in, where are you?

52:37.796 --> 52:40.730
I know the very best pub
for you, Peter.

52:40.835 --> 52:44.218
Lovely log fire.
Irish music sessions

52:44.323 --> 52:45.666
and they serve a great pint.

52:46.564 --> 52:48.287
Are you sure he said Roundwood?

52:48.355 --> 52:50.592
Sir, the surveillance plane can't
spot the subjects

52:50.852 --> 52:51.517
anywhere near Roundwood.

52:51.587 --> 52:52.569
What?

52:52.836 --> 52:53.763
He says they're not in the area.

52:53.859 --> 52:54.807
Well, they have to be.

52:54.914 --> 52:56.223
Are you sure it's Roundwood?
Over.

52:56.323 --> 52:57.981
Maybe they're not
out of the woods yet.

53:01.602 --> 53:04.416
Here we go. That's Roundwood
up ahead there, Peter.

53:04.513 --> 53:07.546
Supposed to be the highest village
in Ireland.

53:07.649 --> 53:09.504
Wouldn't mind living aroung here,
I can tell you.

53:09.569 --> 53:11.640
A lovely quiet spot.

53:11.744 --> 53:13.981
Yes, yes, very tranquil.

53:14.368 --> 53:16.026
They're just
coming into Roundwood now.

53:16.384 --> 53:19.732
Well, the surveillance plane
still can't spot them.

53:19.839 --> 53:21.879
Well, what's going on?

53:21.951 --> 53:24.985
Oh, fuck... God forgive me.

53:25.087 --> 53:27.574
No sign of them. Nothing at all.

53:37.695 --> 53:40.150
What an awful
waste of taxpayers' money.

53:40.254 --> 53:42.042
What's he talking about now?

53:42.142 --> 53:44.825
I hope the Government will pay
for your funeral, Peter.

53:44.893 --> 53:46.103
It's the least they can do.

53:46.173 --> 53:47.897
Please, don't.

53:48.413 --> 53:50.965
Jesus Christ, Michael,
that was fucking amazing.

53:51.037 --> 53:53.939
Here, Tony, Stevie,
wasn't that the business?

53:54.204 --> 53:55.731
I bet the Gardas are sitting there
thinking,

53:55.804 --> 53:58.170
''What the fuck are we
after letting ourselves in for?''

53:58.235 --> 54:00.571
''There is no way
we can get all these fuckers''

54:00.637 --> 54:02.546
''they're untouchable.''

54:32.729 --> 54:35.184
You knew all along, didn't you?

54:35.673 --> 54:37.014
How do you mean?

54:37.113 --> 54:38.520
Like, explain it to me.

54:38.584 --> 54:40.886
What the fuck
did we go through all that for

54:41.144 --> 54:43.032
if you knew Peter was a fake?

54:43.128 --> 54:45.942
They're gonna feel so stupid.

54:46.039 --> 54:49.388
The Gardas are gonna think
they'll never get the better of us.

54:50.135 --> 54:52.045
Yeah, maybe.

54:52.151 --> 54:54.703
I just wouldn't try that one
with stevie right now.

54:54.774 --> 54:57.458
Stevie? Fuck him
if he's got no sense of humor.

55:34.321 --> 55:36.208
On the night, He was betrayed.

55:36.305 --> 55:39.621
He took bread and gave you thanks

55:39.696 --> 55:43.657
and praise. He broke the bread
gave it to his disciples and said

55:43.728 --> 55:48.517
''Take this all of you nd eat it
this is my body''

55:48.623 --> 55:50.663
''which will be given up for you.''

56:11.054 --> 56:13.955
May He make us an everlasting gift
to you

56:14.221 --> 56:17.603
and enable us to share
in the inheritance of your Saints

56:17.677 --> 56:21.091
with Mary,
The Virgin Mother of God

56:21.196 --> 56:22.538
with the Apostles...
the Martyrs...

56:45.417 --> 56:47.784
Right, Michael,
we're up your arse now.

56:50.217 --> 56:52.005
Michael...

56:52.105 --> 56:53.599
Take a look at
what's happening outside.

56:53.672 --> 56:54.173
What?

56:54.408 --> 56:55.902
Look!

57:00.520 --> 57:01.797
What the fuck...

57:19.814 --> 57:20.894
Hi, cunts.

57:20.966 --> 57:22.874
Shut your fucking mouth,
you little toerag.

57:22.981 --> 57:24.868
What the fuck are you
gonna do about it?

57:25.125 --> 57:26.751
I'll fucking shut it for you.

57:26.853 --> 57:29.603
Alec, come here. I'll fucking
shut it for you, you runt.

57:37.028 --> 57:38.969
Lads. It's Christine.

57:39.075 --> 57:40.766
How are you all?

57:42.787 --> 57:44.031
Bastards.

57:45.059 --> 57:48.736
Come on. Let's see what they're at.
Thisi s something new...

57:48.803 --> 57:50.712
we just ignore 'em,
no matter what they do.

57:50.819 --> 57:52.575
Right, lads?

57:52.643 --> 57:53.471
Alec...
What?

57:53.571 --> 57:54.464
They don't exist.

57:54.530 --> 57:55.839
I wouldn't fucking touch them.

57:55.938 --> 57:57.847
Then again I might have to
give someone a good kicking.

57:59.906 --> 58:02.294
Your escorts. Here boys,
we'll look after you.

58:02.561 --> 58:04.154
You fucking wanker,
get out of my way.

58:04.225 --> 58:07.771
That baldy fuck's supposed to be
a mastermind criminal?

58:07.873 --> 58:09.302
You must be joking

58:09.409 --> 58:10.968
just a thick gobshite
who got lucky I'd say.

58:11.232 --> 58:12.344
Well, he's fucked now.

58:12.448 --> 58:14.271
Hey, Lynch,
are you listening to me?

58:14.337 --> 58:16.192
Can you feel it, can you?

58:16.257 --> 58:17.337
You might as well give up now.

58:17.408 --> 58:19.383
Cos we're gonna be glues
to your arse from now on.

58:19.457 --> 58:21.944
Yeah, like flies on shite.

59:08.346 --> 59:10.713
Hey, girls, you got a minute?

59:10.810 --> 59:11.704
What's up with you?

59:11.802 --> 59:12.913
Oh, nothing.

59:12.985 --> 59:15.920
Fucking Gardas, you know,
getting on me nerves.

59:15.993 --> 59:18.513
Listen, I need one of you
to drive me later on.

59:18.905 --> 59:19.985
So where are the Gardas gonna be?

59:20.249 --> 59:22.190
Are you gonna fucking hlep me
or not?

59:22.776 --> 59:23.637
Yeah.

59:25.528 --> 59:26.673
Keep your hair on.

59:38.135 --> 59:40.109
Why can't you cops
leave people alone?

59:40.375 --> 59:42.764
How can they keep this up?
This is harassment.

59:42.871 --> 59:43.918
How many of them are there?

59:44.182 --> 59:46.451
How are we supposed to work
with the cops all over us?

59:46.518 --> 59:48.078
I don't recognize any of them.

59:48.182 --> 59:50.603
Would somebody call the Gardas,
sort out this mess?

59:50.710 --> 59:52.235
They're never around
when you need them.

59:52.341 --> 59:54.894
It's just no fun any more,
is it, Lisa?

59:55.285 --> 59:57.652
time's up and I think you know it.

59:57.972 --> 59:59.860
I've had a contact about
the painting, Michael.

59:59.956 --> 01:00:00.784
Yeah?

01:00:00.851 --> 01:00:02.859
An offer. From the IRA
a hundred grand.

01:00:02.964 --> 01:00:05.299
Not great, I know,

01:00:05.396 --> 01:00:06.705
but it's better than
letting the thing just rot away.

01:00:06.772 --> 01:00:08.625
Their man Higgins said,
if you did the deal

01:00:08.691 --> 01:00:10.098
it would be okay about Billy.

01:00:10.195 --> 01:00:10.827
Sorry?

01:00:11.091 --> 01:00:13.164
Like, if he comes to Dublin,
there'd be no hassle.

01:00:13.267 --> 01:00:15.089
You talked to Higgins about Billy?

01:00:15.155 --> 01:00:16.233
Look, let's do the deal

01:00:16.338 --> 01:00:18.127
so thowe fuckers go after the IRA
and let us alone.

01:00:18.226 --> 01:00:20.845
Fucking sure anyway, it's not
our kind of stuff, you know

01:00:20.947 --> 01:00:21.776
this art shite.

01:00:21.843 --> 01:00:22.988
Let the IRA deal with it, man.

01:00:23.091 --> 01:00:25.643
Look at all these Gardas...
look what we've done to them,

01:00:25.746 --> 01:00:27.437
we've dragged them
down to our level.

01:00:27.538 --> 01:00:28.912
They're acting like criminals now.

01:00:29.010 --> 01:00:30.897
I'm their worst fucking nightmare.

01:00:31.154 --> 01:00:32.779
And now you're telling me
you want to get rid of the painting

01:00:32.881 --> 01:00:35.183
the thing we'll be remembered for.

01:00:36.241 --> 01:00:37.288
You think
he'll give you a hundred grand?

01:00:37.393 --> 01:00:38.091
Yeah.

01:00:38.193 --> 01:00:39.598
Like fuck he will.

01:00:40.144 --> 01:00:41.868
Can't you see
what Higgins is up to?

01:00:41.968 --> 01:00:43.878
It's not about the money,
it's not about the painting.

01:00:43.984 --> 01:00:45.293
It's about splitting us.

01:00:45.552 --> 01:00:48.202
Michael, we're robbers.
We rob for a living.

01:00:48.463 --> 01:00:49.892
I'm not making a living any more.

01:00:49.999 --> 01:00:53.894
Yeah, I know, you need things.
You want money, I know.

01:00:53.999 --> 01:00:55.722
Michael, they're coming.

01:00:55.821 --> 01:00:58.277
Will you have a think about it
what we've been saying?

01:00:58.350 --> 01:00:59.691
Will you, Michael?

01:01:01.006 --> 01:01:03.274
Tell Higgins I'll let him know.

01:01:03.341 --> 01:01:04.835
And I'll let him know too.

01:01:04.941 --> 01:01:06.796
And I hope we're talking about
the same thing.

01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:09.992
See you later, Michael.

01:01:11.469 --> 01:01:12.843
D'you fancy a pint, copper?

01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:23.078
Look at the time,
I'll be late picking up me kids.

01:01:31.275 --> 01:01:33.664
Michael Lynch.
And how are you today?

01:01:35.594 --> 01:01:36.838
What's this?

01:01:37.770 --> 01:01:41.599
Your benefits have been rescinded.

01:01:42.249 --> 01:01:43.361
Try that one again.

01:01:43.721 --> 01:01:45.477
It's the Government.

01:01:45.577 --> 01:01:46.657
I just got the order.

01:01:46.921 --> 01:01:50.335
You see,
they've cut off your payments.

01:01:58.056 --> 01:01:59.997
So I have to...

01:02:00.103 --> 01:02:01.597
you know, I, I, I can't...

01:02:01.702 --> 01:02:03.491
You think
you can break me like this?

01:02:03.559 --> 01:02:06.875
You're off your fucking head.

01:02:07.846 --> 01:02:10.115
Would you stop for a minute
and listen.

01:02:10.214 --> 01:02:12.286
Can't you see
where it's all heading, Michael?

01:02:12.357 --> 01:02:13.601
Only the one way...

01:02:13.829 --> 01:02:15.716
You've been prison twenty years

01:02:15.781 --> 01:02:16.796
Me, Lisa, the kids...

01:02:16.901 --> 01:02:18.974
No, no, I wouldn't
let it fucking happen...

01:02:19.076 --> 01:02:22.905
Michale Lynch, Norman here, good morning

01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:25.850
Tell you the news about donor

01:02:25.956 --> 01:02:28.378
I'd say
Christine's very pissed off.

01:02:28.485 --> 01:02:30.655
You ugly bag os shite.

01:02:32.548 --> 01:02:35.963
You're losing it, Lynch, so fast.

01:02:36.388 --> 01:02:37.217
As long as you live...

01:02:37.315 --> 01:02:38.972
Stop it...

01:02:39.075 --> 01:02:40.701
we'll be here watching you.

01:02:40.771 --> 01:02:41.883
No escape.

01:02:41.987 --> 01:02:43.775
Fuck off, Michael.

01:02:43.875 --> 01:02:46.973
Christine, did we wake you?

01:02:47.906 --> 01:02:49.499
Do you really think they'll ever
let you get away, Michael...

01:02:49.601 --> 01:02:50.300
All right.

01:02:50.401 --> 01:02:51.296
after all you did?

01:02:51.362 --> 01:02:52.256
All right, you're right,

01:02:52.322 --> 01:02:53.402
but they're never gonna
fucking put me away,

01:02:53.474 --> 01:02:55.416
you hear me, no matter
what they fucking do. Never.

01:02:55.522 --> 01:02:56.634
They're out to get you.
What can you do it?

01:02:56.706 --> 01:02:57.567
What can I do about it?

01:02:57.633 --> 01:02:59.576
I'll tell you
what I'll fucking do about it...

01:02:59.842 --> 01:03:01.532
Christine...

01:03:02.209 --> 01:03:04.314
Sorry for the disturbance,
Christine.

01:03:11.616 --> 01:03:12.477
Bastards.

01:03:17.438 --> 01:03:19.446
I never thought
they'd get this close.

01:03:26.302 --> 01:03:27.676
Hey, Lynch...

01:03:27.774 --> 01:03:29.301
What's so, what?

01:03:29.565 --> 01:03:30.842
Show us your ugly mug.

01:03:30.942 --> 01:03:33.079
If they were me down,
then it was all worth nothing.

01:03:33.148 --> 01:03:35.003
I'll lose everything.

01:03:36.445 --> 01:03:39.794
You... Lisa... the kids.

01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:53.529
What about the painting?
If we got some money...

01:03:53.628 --> 01:03:55.155
I wasn't in it for the money.

01:03:55.420 --> 01:03:57.753
In it for the crack.

01:03:57.850 --> 01:03:59.639
I got a few good laughs
out of it.

01:04:02.683 --> 01:04:05.399
You know what you are?

01:04:06.393 --> 01:04:07.637
That good, yeah?

01:04:08.090 --> 01:04:11.286
Wouldn't be everyone's cup of tea,
but it suits me.

01:04:33.337 --> 01:04:34.863
That is disgusting.

01:04:34.969 --> 01:04:36.757
Hey, keep the noise down, Lynch.

01:05:16.083 --> 01:05:18.025
How are you, Michael?

01:05:18.451 --> 01:05:20.393
You got me offer?

01:05:20.498 --> 01:05:22.320
So what do you think?

01:05:23.281 --> 01:05:25.932
Last time we spoke
I told you to go fuck yourself.

01:05:26.962 --> 01:05:29.548
Things have changed a bit
since then, haven't they?

01:05:29.649 --> 01:05:30.664
That's right, Michael.

01:05:30.769 --> 01:05:32.940
I mean, all these lads, following
it's not good, you know?

01:05:33.201 --> 01:05:34.695
one has to face facts.

01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:36.655
You cut your cloth, Michael.

01:05:37.041 --> 01:05:38.666
So I suppose
it'll come as a bit of a shock

01:05:38.736 --> 01:05:40.874
when I tell you
to go fuck yourself again.

01:05:40.944 --> 01:05:42.886
I'd tear up that painting
and wipe me hole with it

01:05:42.991 --> 01:05:44.398
before I let you near it.

01:05:46.096 --> 01:05:47.404
It's too late for you, Michael.

01:05:47.663 --> 01:05:50.532
There's no Lord Mayors begging to
do you favours any more.

01:05:50.607 --> 01:05:52.712
That's long gone.

01:05:52.815 --> 01:05:53.676
I've a picture in me head of you

01:05:53.775 --> 01:05:55.945
sitting with your grandchild
on your knee.

01:05:56.046 --> 01:05:58.566
A bit of drool
coming slowly down your chin.

01:05:58.638 --> 01:06:00.678
Talking shite.

01:06:00.750 --> 01:06:02.277
Michael who?

01:06:23.180 --> 01:06:25.416
We have a show. Tony.

01:06:33.643 --> 01:06:34.177
Michael.

01:06:34.282 --> 01:06:35.558
Tony.

01:06:36.778 --> 01:06:38.502
I've been fucking you around,
haven't I?

01:06:39.851 --> 01:06:41.607
Yeah, you have, Michael.

01:06:42.665 --> 01:06:43.778
I'm sorry.

01:06:44.681 --> 01:06:47.332
Well, it's to be expected
with all this shite going on.

01:06:47.434 --> 01:06:48.994
Yeah, but whatever Stevie's up to,

01:06:49.065 --> 01:06:50.624
he's gonna make things worse.
You know that, don't you?

01:06:50.888 --> 01:06:52.863
No, I don't
He's only trying to sort things.

01:06:52.968 --> 01:06:54.245
Get us back to where we were.

01:06:54.345 --> 01:06:56.003
Oh, you think that's what
Higgins wants? You believe that?

01:06:56.104 --> 01:06:57.991
What choice do we have?
You're not helping.

01:07:01.576 --> 01:07:03.748
Do you think
any of these fellas can lip-read?

01:07:04.361 --> 01:07:06.880
You'd be amazed the skills
the Gardas have these days.

01:07:11.111 --> 01:07:13.446
You're fantastic lads.

01:07:14.982 --> 01:07:17.371
Do you know that?

01:07:17.478 --> 01:07:19.071
He's got a crack.

01:07:19.463 --> 01:07:21.666
For Christ sake, Michael.

01:07:21.734 --> 01:07:25.247
Tell me then. What's next?

01:07:26.053 --> 01:07:28.901
Stevie's gonna try to get
the painting to Higgins, isn't he?

01:07:28.966 --> 01:07:30.372
With or without me.

01:07:32.324 --> 01:07:35.172
Come on, we all know that, Tony.

01:07:35.269 --> 01:07:37.243
So how's he gonna
get away from the Gardas?

01:07:39.651 --> 01:07:41.756
It's a good plan.
I think it'll work.

01:07:41.859 --> 01:07:44.893
Fair enough.
Tell it to me then.

01:07:46.306 --> 01:07:48.575
Come on, trust me with it,
will you?

01:07:50.210 --> 01:07:51.934
You know Copeland Grove?

01:07:52.034 --> 01:07:52.863
Yeah.

01:07:52.930 --> 01:07:54.621
It's a cul-de-sac, right.
With the steps at the end.

01:07:54.723 --> 01:07:55.933
Yeah, leading up to Summerhill.

01:07:56.162 --> 01:07:57.820
You're gonna drive up there.

01:07:58.371 --> 01:08:00.193
How? All together?
One car's no good.

01:08:00.291 --> 01:08:01.664
No.

01:08:01.729 --> 01:08:03.933
No... a car each,
so you could block the road.

01:08:04.001 --> 01:08:05.856
Not bad, if you can pull it off.

01:08:05.954 --> 01:08:07.328
Don't see why we can't.

01:08:07.425 --> 01:08:08.702
A car will be waiting for you?

01:08:08.801 --> 01:08:09.815
Van.

01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:11.164
Of course, for the painting.
No, that's not bad.

01:08:11.264 --> 01:08:14.079
Alec can move that out
lively enough.

01:08:14.656 --> 01:08:16.859
Yeah. Once we get shot of
the Gardass... all we have...

01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:18.170
Hold on a minute.

01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:20.094
That's where it'll happen.

01:08:20.158 --> 01:08:21.533
What?

01:08:22.207 --> 01:08:23.636
Oh, you'll get rid of the Gardas
all right.

01:08:24.926 --> 01:08:25.657
Easily.

01:08:27.390 --> 01:08:29.179
Cos I think they'll be tipped off.

01:08:30.014 --> 01:08:31.258
Which is better for Higgins?

01:08:31.359 --> 01:08:32.787
To buy some painting
he can't get rid of

01:08:32.862 --> 01:08:34.770
or to get all of Michael Lynch's
gang arrested in one go?

01:08:34.845 --> 01:08:37.845
Leaving just me for him to
come after in his own good time.

01:08:38.461 --> 01:08:39.475
Think about it...

01:08:40.604 --> 01:08:41.946
Higgins or Stevie...

01:08:42.555 --> 01:08:44.497
who would the smart money be on?

01:08:50.203 --> 01:08:53.203
Look, all I'm saying...
whatever happens...

01:08:53.276 --> 01:08:56.721
I promise... I'll be waiting.

01:09:14.232 --> 01:09:16.055
Come and get me.

01:09:24.470 --> 01:09:26.707
oh, you'll get rid of
the Gardas all right.

01:09:27.224 --> 01:09:28.564
Easily.

01:09:28.630 --> 01:09:30.518
Cos Higgins will
have tipped them off.

01:09:30.582 --> 01:09:32.109
The way me and Higgins see it is,

01:09:32.214 --> 01:09:34.582
if we're reasonable,
we can divide the work.

01:09:34.679 --> 01:09:37.100
Co-operate, let each other know
what we're doing,

01:09:37.206 --> 01:09:39.028
that kind of thing, so as we
don't get in each other's way.

01:09:39.126 --> 01:09:39.792
Yeah.

01:09:39.863 --> 01:09:41.171
While the cops are looking for us,

01:09:41.270 --> 01:09:43.245
Higgins is robbing the bank
on Dame Street.

01:09:43.350 --> 01:09:44.779
I can't believe what I'm hearing.
Stevie,

01:09:44.853 --> 01:09:46.413
I thought we were doing one thing...

01:09:46.517 --> 01:09:47.946
unloading the painting

01:09:48.054 --> 01:09:49.298
to try and get everything
back to normal Persuade...

01:09:49.366 --> 01:09:52.332
Yeah, normal that means no Michael.

01:09:52.404 --> 01:09:54.127
Cos he's not normal any more,
is he?

01:09:54.228 --> 01:09:56.170
Alec, pull up here.

01:09:56.533 --> 01:09:59.914
If anything goes against us...
It'll be nothing to do with me.

01:10:03.091 --> 01:10:03.855
Yeah?

01:10:03.923 --> 01:10:05.930
It's Tony, you were right, Michael.

01:10:06.036 --> 01:10:07.213
Stevie's gone over to Higgins.

01:10:07.282 --> 01:10:09.105
Okay... Are you free?
Anyone on to you?

01:10:09.202 --> 01:10:11.341
Nah, not a Garda in sight.

01:10:11.443 --> 01:10:12.555
Jesus, yes. Right.

01:10:12.626 --> 01:10:14.731
Liten, have you found out anything?

01:10:14.834 --> 01:10:15.913
Where's Higgins picking up
the painting?

01:10:16.145 --> 01:10:17.770
It's Stevie
who's doing the pick-up.

01:10:18.033 --> 01:10:20.270
Apparently while he's
collecting the painting...

01:10:20.338 --> 01:10:22.542
Higgins is planning to rob a bank.

01:10:22.641 --> 01:10:25.162
I think it's some plan
to confuse the Gardas.

01:10:26.098 --> 01:10:27.025
Do you know where?

01:10:27.121 --> 01:10:29.543
The Metro Bank in Dame Street,
Stevie said.

01:10:29.617 --> 01:10:31.177
Jut before mid-day.

01:10:32.016 --> 01:10:33.161
All right, here's what you do...

01:10:33.424 --> 01:10:34.853
you get there now, fast,
to check it out.

01:10:34.929 --> 01:10:35.911
And make sure
you're not being followed.

01:10:36.016 --> 01:10:36.616
Yeah.

01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:37.702
Ring me in fifteen minutes.

01:10:37.809 --> 01:10:38.702
Okay.

01:10:38.799 --> 01:10:40.621
Oh, and Tony...
Yeah?

01:10:40.719 --> 01:10:42.280
What are you wearing by the way?

01:10:46.256 --> 01:10:47.182
Well?

01:10:47.982 --> 01:10:48.549
What?

01:10:48.782 --> 01:10:50.212
Have you two kissed and made up?

01:10:50.767 --> 01:10:52.872
Me and Tony? Oh, yeah, sure.

01:10:52.943 --> 01:10:53.772
Good.

01:10:53.871 --> 01:10:55.845
Can't be falling out with friends
like him.

01:11:02.541 --> 01:11:04.614
Listen girls...

01:11:05.389 --> 01:11:07.528
I think I'm gonna be able to
fix things, you know

01:11:07.629 --> 01:11:10.084
so you wont' be
walking the streets begging.

01:11:10.157 --> 01:11:12.741
Tony and me have come up
with something...

01:11:12.812 --> 01:11:15.912
something very tasty.
Like this...

01:11:17.645 --> 01:11:19.051
Listen, I gotta go, okay?

01:11:19.116 --> 01:11:20.709
Don't worry. It's grand, Michael.

01:11:21.517 --> 01:11:23.721
Go on so.
Get out from under our feet.

01:11:23.820 --> 01:11:27.529
Wish me luck, girls, there's
a lot of bad people out there.

01:11:29.707 --> 01:11:30.568
Hi, da.

01:11:30.667 --> 01:11:31.877
Nothing yet, Michael.

01:11:31.947 --> 01:11:32.896
Maybe Stevie was bullshitting.

01:11:32.971 --> 01:11:35.426
I don't thinkso.
I think we're in business, Tony.

01:11:35.498 --> 01:11:36.775
All right, now are you listening?
Yeah.

01:11:36.875 --> 01:11:38.729
Here's how it's gonna happen.

01:11:38.826 --> 01:11:42.720
You hang around inside the bank.
I'll be outside.

01:11:51.592 --> 01:11:53.479
There'll be the usual Gardas
in attendance.

01:11:53.545 --> 01:11:55.235
But not so many.

01:11:55.336 --> 01:11:57.921
Remember...
Higgins will betray Stevie...

01:11:58.023 --> 01:12:00.227
At last we can make
some fucking money on this thing.

01:12:00.327 --> 01:12:01.887
So most of the armed units

01:12:01.959 --> 01:12:03.934
will be chasing him and Alec
to get the painting.

01:12:11.783 --> 01:12:15.131
Now once Higgins' boys arrive...
we're off and running.

01:12:34.563 --> 01:12:36.636
I'm disappointed in you, Shay.

01:12:37.634 --> 01:12:39.041
Mother of Christ.

01:12:42.914 --> 01:12:44.256
That's Shay Kirby.

01:12:44.898 --> 01:12:46.010
Let's check it out.

01:12:48.033 --> 01:12:49.975
Good morning.
I'd like to apply for a loan.

01:12:53.824 --> 01:12:54.751
Thank you.

01:12:55.424 --> 01:12:56.440
How's it going, Shay?

01:12:56.546 --> 01:12:57.494
Put it down. Drop it.

01:12:57.601 --> 01:12:58.747
Put it down, now. Drop it.

01:12:58.818 --> 01:13:00.159
Take it easy, Shay.

01:13:00.257 --> 01:13:02.361
Put it down!
Now!

01:13:02.464 --> 01:13:06.392
Put it down!
Do it. Nice and easy.

01:13:06.497 --> 01:13:08.765
Stand up! Turn around!

01:13:08.863 --> 01:13:09.911
Against the wall.

01:13:10.015 --> 01:13:11.160
Fuck!

01:13:12.959 --> 01:13:15.545
Alec, watch the fucking painting.
Jesus Christ.

01:13:17.822 --> 01:13:21.400
Don't move a fucking muscle.

01:13:21.470 --> 01:13:23.641
Fuck me. What the fuck
are we gonna do, man?

01:13:23.742 --> 01:13:25.977
Right,
keep the fucking painting up...

01:13:26.077 --> 01:13:27.571
Right, right,
we keep behind the painting.

01:13:27.677 --> 01:13:28.276
Why?

01:13:28.381 --> 01:13:29.363
Keep behind the fucking painting!

01:13:29.469 --> 01:13:30.484
Right, right.
Come on, back we go then.

01:13:30.589 --> 01:13:31.418
Right.

01:13:31.517 --> 01:13:32.760
Shite!

01:13:36.028 --> 01:13:37.108
Go...
Fucking back up.

01:13:40.923 --> 01:13:42.035
Drop the guns!

01:13:44.731 --> 01:13:45.811
Drop the guns!

01:13:47.644 --> 01:13:48.570
What the fuck are we gonna do?

01:13:48.667 --> 01:13:50.074
Drop the fucking picture!

01:14:12.696 --> 01:14:16.405
Everybody...
On your knees now.

01:14:20.855 --> 01:14:22.317
Get down.

01:14:23.159 --> 01:14:25.876
You're a fucking arsehole.
What the fuck are we gonna do?

01:14:25.975 --> 01:14:27.632
Michael would never have gotten us
into this fucking mess.

01:14:27.702 --> 01:14:30.353
Cara-fucking-vaggio.

01:14:40.214 --> 01:14:41.741
Fuck art!

01:14:46.293 --> 01:14:47.275
All right, Liam, he's safe.

01:14:47.541 --> 01:14:48.490
We need back-up.

01:14:48.821 --> 01:14:50.031
This is foxtrot one calling...

01:14:50.101 --> 01:14:52.042
we request immediate
armed assistance.

01:14:52.308 --> 01:14:53.453
We've got a situation here.

01:14:53.524 --> 01:14:55.215
All armed units are
chasing that painting!

01:14:55.316 --> 01:14:56.625
Fucking bollocks!

01:14:57.652 --> 01:14:59.244
What the fuck are you looking at?

01:14:59.347 --> 01:15:00.624
All right let's move.

01:15:01.235 --> 01:15:02.348
Right, stay there.

01:15:04.372 --> 01:15:05.965
You'll have to sign for that boys.

01:15:14.067 --> 01:15:16.238
Drop the gun.

01:15:19.250 --> 01:15:20.428
Don't... don't fucking shoot me!

01:15:20.498 --> 01:15:24.174
Drop the gun.
Nice and easy.

01:15:24.241 --> 01:15:27.241
Michael Lynch is involved. This is
a highly dangerous situation.

01:15:27.345 --> 01:15:30.127
We're doing our best, but we've
no armed units right now.

01:15:30.193 --> 01:15:32.941
For fuck's sake,
we need armed units, now!

01:15:39.663 --> 01:15:41.289
Holy shit.

01:15:41.391 --> 01:15:43.758
Hope they dont' take that
out of your wages, boss.

01:15:44.719 --> 01:15:46.606
Sorry, Noel,
we've got urgent calls.

01:15:46.702 --> 01:15:49.517
There's an armed robbery going on
in the Metro Bank in Dame Street.

01:15:49.582 --> 01:15:52.266
They're still inside,
and apparently one of the's Lynch.

01:15:56.493 --> 01:15:57.475
Fuck!

01:15:58.829 --> 01:15:59.974
How the fuck did he...

01:16:00.077 --> 01:16:01.932
I've no idea.

01:16:03.916 --> 01:16:05.443
Tell them to keep him there.

01:16:05.548 --> 01:16:06.660
Whatever they do, keep him there.

01:16:06.732 --> 01:16:07.626
Right, Noel.

01:16:07.692 --> 01:16:09.186
Come on, lads, out of here.
Come on, move.

01:16:09.292 --> 01:16:13.000
Luke, get on to Control.
I want cars down there now.

01:16:13.067 --> 01:16:14.474
And get those guys out of the bank.

01:16:16.075 --> 01:16:18.115
Michael Lynch talking.
Do you hear me?

01:16:18.219 --> 01:16:21.634
I'm coming out.
I'm giving myself up. Okay?

01:16:22.891 --> 01:16:23.971
What do you want me to do?

01:16:24.075 --> 01:16:25.668
Die, you motherfucker.

01:16:25.739 --> 01:16:29.218
Put your hands clearly in the air
and come out slowly.

01:16:29.322 --> 01:16:32.257
Okay. Here I come, lads.

01:16:34.281 --> 01:16:37.096
Keep walking towards us
until we tell you to stop.

01:16:37.161 --> 01:16:39.812
You fellas are gonna be famous
do you know that?

01:16:40.297 --> 01:16:41.725
Shoot the fucker.

01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:43.010
Put your gun down.

01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:48.486
Walk away from it.

01:16:48.552 --> 01:16:51.006
You're dead, Lynch,
so's your fucking family.

01:16:51.270 --> 01:16:52.383
Shut up.

01:16:56.391 --> 01:16:58.943
All right, everyone stand up.
Up, up, now.

01:16:59.046 --> 01:17:01.054
Go, move...

01:17:01.158 --> 01:17:02.173
What the...?

01:17:02.278 --> 01:17:03.904
How are you doing?

01:17:07.909 --> 01:17:09.698
Shoot the fucker!

01:17:11.750 --> 01:17:12.698
Get down...

01:17:12.806 --> 01:17:14.299
Lynch is still in there.

01:17:19.108 --> 01:17:21.311
Keep Lynch there
whatever happens.

01:17:21.379 --> 01:17:23.070
Repeat, keep Lynch there.

01:17:23.140 --> 01:17:24.417
What the fuck now?

01:17:27.780 --> 01:17:29.601
Lynch, come out.

01:17:32.035 --> 01:17:33.529
Lynch!

01:17:43.586 --> 01:17:45.112
Rifle.

01:17:53.536 --> 01:17:54.681
What's going on?

01:17:55.008 --> 01:17:56.186
Haven't a clue.

01:17:56.448 --> 01:17:58.357
But Lynch is still in there.

01:17:58.432 --> 01:17:59.480
Good.

01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:06.429
Are you out there, Noel?

01:18:06.528 --> 01:18:09.342
I know I've been messing
with your lads

01:18:09.439 --> 01:18:12.286
and they're probably a bit annoyed.

01:18:12.383 --> 01:18:14.008
But this is it.

01:18:14.111 --> 01:18:16.696
You have me for real this time.

01:18:17.214 --> 01:18:18.490
I'm coming out.

01:18:22.974 --> 01:18:24.761
Put the gun down.

01:18:27.421 --> 01:18:29.308
Put the fucking weapon down.

01:19:03.066 --> 01:19:06.032
Noel... that's it?

01:19:06.681 --> 01:19:08.753
Tell his wife to come
and identify the body.

01:19:08.857 --> 01:19:09.937
Okay.

01:19:27.127 --> 01:19:28.784
Where's Michael?

01:19:29.975 --> 01:19:31.436
Tony?

01:20:00.179 --> 01:20:02.994
Are you Michael Lynch's wife
Christine?

01:20:07.379 --> 01:20:12.365
And you are his sister-in-law
Lisa?

01:20:14.642 --> 01:20:15.819
Right.

01:20:18.834 --> 01:20:20.743
Would you formally
identify this body

01:20:20.850 --> 01:20:23.216
as that of your husband
Michael Lynch?

01:20:25.649 --> 01:20:27.242
A nod'll do.

01:20:31.856 --> 01:20:33.383
Oh God.

01:20:41.103 --> 01:20:43.973
Sure they'd never recognise him
with his head in that state.

01:20:45.839 --> 01:20:46.766
I think they will.

01:20:46.862 --> 01:20:48.291
What?

01:20:54.086 --> 01:20:55.809
Oh yes, of course, right enough.

01:21:00.998 --> 01:21:03.168
So, is that him then, girls?

01:21:09.509 --> 01:21:13.916
Yes...
this is the body of my husband.

01:21:26.275 --> 01:21:27.769
Right...

01:21:27.843 --> 01:21:30.593
it's over... well done.

01:21:40.802 --> 01:21:42.229
Take it

01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:54.167
Give me the fucking mask

01:22:07.005 --> 01:22:08.566
Good morning, Jero

01:22:10.845 --> 01:22:12.274
Before we go our separate ways,

01:22:12.382 --> 01:22:14.836
let us take leave of
our brother Michael.

01:22:14.909 --> 01:22:18.040
May our farewell express
our affection for him.

01:22:18.109 --> 01:22:21.654
May it ease our sadness
and strengthen our hope.

01:22:24.412 --> 01:22:26.779
Lynch would love this send off.

01:22:28.379 --> 01:22:30.266
He's probably up there somewhere

01:22:30.331 --> 01:22:33.048
having a good laugh at the idea
of us protecting him now.

01:22:52.024 --> 01:22:54.227
It was the right thing to do, Noel.

01:22:54.328 --> 01:22:57.197
Fuck it, he's dead.

01:23:00.151 --> 01:23:03.184
Something between me and him, Ger.

01:23:03.767 --> 01:23:06.069
It's the way
these things usually end up.

01:23:10.774 --> 01:23:12.498
Now, that's what your mummy
sent you for.

01:23:12.567 --> 01:23:13.745
Yeah, she'll pay you tomorrow.

01:23:13.846 --> 01:23:15.734
Grand. Mind yourself
crossing that road now.

01:23:15.830 --> 01:23:16.495
Okay.

01:23:16.566 --> 01:23:17.297
Bye.

01:23:17.366 --> 01:23:18.478
Bye.

01:23:19.190 --> 01:23:20.172
Hiya.

01:23:20.277 --> 01:23:24.433
Hello there.
Lovely day for it huh?

01:23:24.693 --> 01:23:26.580
It certainly is.

01:23:28.052 --> 01:23:29.100
And how are you today?

01:23:30.006 --> 01:23:32.722
Well, now...

01:23:32.788 --> 01:23:34.828
Let's see now.

01:23:35.349 --> 01:23:37.236
Is that tins of corned beef
you have there?

01:23:37.333 --> 01:23:41.260
Yep, ''John West''.
Do you want one?

01:23:41.620 --> 01:23:44.205
I'll tell you what,
can you hang on to it for me?

01:23:44.307 --> 01:23:45.769
I'll collect it
later on me way back.

01:23:45.875 --> 01:23:48.143
Save me lugging it
around on the bike.

01:23:48.210 --> 01:23:51.756
Well, of course.
That's a grand bike you have.

01:23:51.859 --> 01:23:53.997
I wish I had your speed.

01:23:55.826 --> 01:23:57.931
Well, gets me around, you know.

01:24:02.579 --> 01:24:03.952
Good luck.

01:24:04.402 --> 01:24:05.514
Bye.

01:25:00.236 --> 01:25:03.618
Michael, you just can't live
without us, can you?

01:25:29.896 --> 01:25:31.283
Bless us, oh, Lord.

01:25:31.287 --> 01:25:33.999
And these thy gifts,
which of thy bounty,

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:38.465
we are about to receive
through Christ our Lord, amen.
