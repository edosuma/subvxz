TRYING TO KILL YOU,

05:53.930 --> 05:55.270
WHY DON'T YOU JUST

07:56.810 --> 07:58.930
IT'S KIND OF LIKE A
SECURITY DETAIL THING.

07:58.980 --> 08:00.180
[DES] CARL MAHER?

08:00.230 --> 08:02.140
YOU KNOW I CAN'T
SEE DEAD PEOPLE, RIGHT?

08:02.190 --> 08:03.560
[JAKE] OKAY, JUST SHUT UP.

08:03.600 --> 08:04.860
I'LL TEXT YOU THE LOCATION.

08:04.900 --> 08:06.440
TELL NO ONE, ALRIGHT?

08:06.480 --> 08:07.570
[DES] OKAY.

08:07.610 --> 08:08.900
[DES] UH, I'M REALLY SORRY.

08:08.940 --> 08:11.070
I, UM... I GOTTA GO.

08:11.110 --> 08:13.280
CAN WE MAYBE TALK LATER
THOUGH, OR SOMETHING?

08:13.320 --> 08:14.620
[CHANDRA] UH... IT'S... YEAH,

08:14.660 --> 08:16.740
IT'S FINE. I--
I GOTTA STUDY ANYWAY, SO...

08:16.780 --> 08:18.740
[DES] THAT'S HOT.
I MEAN, YOU--

08:18.790 --> 08:20.450
YOU ARE HOT. I MEAN, YES!

08:20.500 --> 08:21.540
[CHANDRA]&lt; LAUGHS &gt;

08:21.580 --> 08:22.580
[DES] YOU-- YOU--
YEAH, YOU ARE HOT.

08:22.620 --> 08:24.330
YOU LOOK GOOD.

08:24.380 --> 08:25.670
[CHANDRA] GET OUTTA HERE.

08:25.710 --> 08:27.380
[DES] OKAY.&lt; LAUGHS &gt;

08:27.420 --> 08:29.050
[JAKE] SO CARL THINKS HIS WIFE
TRIED TO KILL HIM.

08:29.090 --> 08:30.460
REALLY, IT'S A MATCH
MADE IN HEAVEN.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.300
[MAL] LET'S JUST TALK TO HER,
FEEL HER OUT.

08:32.340 --> 08:33.470
[JAKE] WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

08:33.510 --> 08:34.550
[MAL] ERIN AND BERT.

08:34.590 --> 08:35.760
[BERT] I TOLD YOU TO
GIVE IT A FEW DAYS.

08:35.800 --> 08:37.140
[ERIN] WHILE WE WATCH
THE WHOLE BUSINESS GO UNDER?

08:37.180 --> 08:38.810
I THOUGHT OLIVE
WOULD BE GLAD TO SELL.

08:38.850 --> 08:40.810
[BERT] YOUR LITTLE GIFT
FOR OLIVE
DIDN'T SOFTEN HER STANCE.

08:40.850 --> 08:42.600
BUT I'LL PUT IT TO GOOD USE.

08:42.640 --> 08:43.810
[ERIN] BERT, GIVE ME--
GIVE ME THAT!

08:43.850 --> 08:45.150
YOU'VE BEEN SOBER THREE YEARS.

08:45.190 --> 08:46.230
[BERT] WELL, PERFECT.

08:46.270 --> 08:47.570
IT'LL GIVE ME
A REASON TO CELEBRATE!

08:47.610 --> 08:49.690
I HATED CARL
WHEN HE WAS ALIVE,

08:49.730 --> 08:50.570
AND NOW EVEN FROM THE GRAVE

08:50.610 --> 08:51.990
HE'S MAKING MY LIFE
A LIVING HELL.

08:52.820 --> 08:53.910
[JAKE] GUESS WHAT?

08:54.530 --> 08:55.820
[BERT] DON'T--

08:56.530 --> 09:00.290
[♪]

09:02.790 --> 09:04.500
&lt; DOOR SHUTTING &gt;

09:04.540 --> 09:06.290
&lt; KNOCKING &gt;

09:06.790 --> 09:08.540
[JAKE] HI, OLIVE.

09:09.590 --> 09:11.340
[OLIVE] WHO ARE YOU?

09:11.380 --> 09:13.590
DID THEY SEND YOU TO GET ME
TO SIGN THE BUSINESS OVER?

09:13.630 --> 09:16.340
BECAUSE IF THEY DID
I ALREADY GAVE YOU MY ANSWER.

09:16.390 --> 09:17.800
[MAL] NO, NO, NO. WE'RE

09:17.850 --> 09:19.560
PRIVATE INVESTIGATORS,
ACTUALLY.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.180
WE WANTED TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT THE

09:21.220 --> 09:23.180
CIRCUMSTANCES
SURROUNDING YOUR HUSBAND'S...

09:24.020 --> 09:25.230
DEATH.

09:25.270 --> 09:27.860
[OLIVE] WHO HIRED YOU?
CRYSTAL?

09:27.900 --> 09:29.940
SHE THINKS I KILLED HIM.
AND I DIDN'T.

09:29.980 --> 09:31.190
IT'S HARD ENOUGH
LIVING WITH HER.

09:31.230 --> 09:32.440
THE WOMAN'S A MANIAC!

09:32.490 --> 09:33.650
[JAKE] IT'S NOTHING LIKE THAT.

09:33.690 --> 09:35.610
WE'RE JUST FRIENDS OF CARL'S,

09:35.650 --> 09:39.620
AND, UM, WE'RE JUST
LOOKING FORA LITTLE INSIGHT.

09:39.660 --> 09:42.660
[OLIVE] I'M SORRY. IT'S JUST,
IT'S BEEN A TRYING DAY.

09:47.500 --> 09:50.710
[OLIVE] CARL WENT
DIVING ON HIS OWN,

09:50.750 --> 09:52.590
WHICH I BEGGED HIM NOT TO DO.

09:52.630 --> 09:55.590
SOMETIMES YOU JUST COULDN'T
TELL HIM ANYTHING.

09:55.630 --> 09:57.590
[JAKE] IT'S NO SECRET
THAT CARL...

09:58.760 --> 10:00.550
WELL, THAT HE
HAD A LOT OF MONEY.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.140
[OLIVE] YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHO GOT HIS MONEY?

10:02.180 --> 10:03.560
YOU SHOULD TALK TO CRYSTAL.

10:03.600 --> 10:04.850
HE GAVE HER ALL THE CASH

10:04.890 --> 10:06.940
AND LEFT ME HALF OF
A PAVING COMPANY

10:06.980 --> 10:08.650
THAT'S BEEN LOSING MONEY
FOR MONTHS.

10:08.690 --> 10:11.070
BUT HONESTLY,
MONEY DOESN'T MATTER.

10:11.110 --> 10:13.320
WITHOUT CARL,
IT'S NOT WORTH ANYTHING.

10:13.360 --> 10:14.360
NONE OF IT.

10:15.990 --> 10:17.780
[OLIVE] IF YOU'LL
SEE YOURSELVES OUT,

10:17.820 --> 10:19.450
I'M GOING TO TRY TO GET A
MINUTE OF SLEEP

10:19.490 --> 10:21.120
WHILE CRAZY CRYSTAL'S
OUT OF THE HOUSE.

10:21.910 --> 10:23.740
LOCK THE DOOR BEHIND YOU.

10:23.790 --> 10:25.000
[MAL] SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.

10:28.330 --> 10:30.670
[JAKE] SHE'S OBVIOUSLY NOT
A FAN OF CRYSTAL'S.

10:30.710 --> 10:32.040
[MAL] TAKE THAT AS A WARNING.

10:32.090 --> 10:33.300
I KNOW SHE DRUGGED US,

10:33.340 --> 10:35.630
AND A NORMAL MAN WOULDN'T
SEE THAT AS A TURN-ON,

10:35.670 --> 10:36.800
BUT WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT YOU, REMEMBER?

10:36.840 --> 10:38.050
&lt; PHONE RINGING &gt;

10:38.090 --> 10:39.840
[MAL] I'M GONNA TRACK DOWN
THE BUSINESS PARTNERS,

10:39.890 --> 10:41.760
HAVE A CHAT. SEE YOU LATER.

10:41.800 --> 10:43.720
[JAKE] HELLO?

10:43.760 --> 10:45.520
[KATHLEEN] JAKE, THIS IS
KIND OF AN EMERGENCY, OKAY?

10:45.560 --> 10:47.060
DO YOU HAVE ROSE'S
CELL PHONE NUMBER?

10:47.100 --> 10:48.730
[JAKE] OH, GREAT.

10:48.770 --> 10:49.810
WHAT DID YOU DO?

10:49.850 --> 10:51.560
[KATHLEEN] JUST GIVE ME THE
NUMBER AND DON'T BE A BRAT.

10:51.610 --> 10:53.730
[JAKE] WELL, THE NUMBER
IS ON A PIECE OF PAPER

10:53.770 --> 10:56.030
STUCK TO THE FRIDGE,
BUT I WANT TO KNOW,

10:56.070 --> 10:57.360
WHAT ARE YOU
INTO HERE, KATHLEEN?

10:57.400 --> 10:58.780
[KATHLEEN] YOU KNOW WHAT,
I'M NOT INTO ANYTHING, OKAY?

10:58.820 --> 10:59.860
AND I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

10:59.910 --> 11:00.910
[JAKE] RIGHT.

11:02.740 --> 11:04.450
&lt; ROSE'S CELL PHONE RINGING &gt;

11:05.450 --> 11:06.660
[JAKE] WHAT WAS THAT? HELLO?

11:07.660 --> 11:08.660
KATHLEEN?

11:10.580 --> 11:11.960
[JAKE] KATHLEEN?

11:12.960 --> 11:15.380
[KATHLEEN] CRAP.
YEAH, I GOTTA GO.

11:15.960 --> 11:17.380
[JAKE] KA--

11:17.420 --> 11:18.720
&lt; SEAGULLS &gt;

11:19.470 --> 11:21.720
&lt; CONSTRUCTION NOISES &gt;

11:21.760 --> 11:23.930
[ERIN] BERT AND I HAVE BEEN
TRYING TO BUY OUT CARL'S SHARE

11:23.970 --> 11:24.850
FOR OVER A YEAR.

11:24.890 --> 11:26.890
BUT NOW OLIVE REFUSES TO SELL.

11:26.930 --> 11:28.480
WE'RE BARELY
STAYING AFLOAT HERE.

11:28.520 --> 11:30.940
IF SHE TIES UP THE BUSINESS
LIKE THIS, WE ARE SUNK.

11:30.980 --> 11:32.190
[MAL] WHY WON'T SHE SELL?

11:32.230 --> 11:35.190
[ERIN] IT'S BEYOND ME.
SHE'S GOT NO INTEREST
IN THE PAVING BUSINESS.

11:35.230 --> 11:38.440
AND, TO BE FRANK,
I'M NOT SURE SHE WAS VERY
INTERESTED IN CARL EITHER.

11:38.490 --> 11:39.530
[MAL] IS THAT A FACT?

11:39.570 --> 11:40.950
[ERIN] NO, IT'S NOT.

11:40.990 --> 11:43.160
BUT IF YOU ASK ME,
I WOULD TELL YOU THAT

11:43.200 --> 11:44.620
OLIVE ONLY MARRIED
CARL FOR HIS MONEY.

11:45.330 --> 11:47.080
[BERT] WE GOTTA TALK. NOW.

11:47.120 --> 11:48.830
[MAL] HEY BERT. HOW YA DOING?

11:48.870 --> 11:49.790
[BERT] I KNOW YOU?

11:49.830 --> 11:50.960
[MAL] MALACHY DOYLE.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.920
[ERIN] MALACHY IS
INVESTIGATING CARL'S DEATH.

11:52.960 --> 11:54.170
[BERT] GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

11:56.880 --> 11:58.960
[ERIN] HE'S JUST TICKED OFF.

11:59.010 --> 12:00.550
WITH CARL DEAD,
THE WHOLE THING'S A MESS.

12:01.050 --> 12:02.760
EXCUSE ME.

12:02.800 --> 12:03.760
&lt; ENGINE STARTING &gt;

12:06.260 --> 12:07.970
[DES]&lt; SIGH &gt;

12:08.020 --> 12:10.770
I'M ABOUT TO ENTER THE HIDEOUT
OF ONE CARL MAHER.

12:10.810 --> 12:12.390
OH, AND IN CASE
ANYTHING SHOULD HAPPEN TO ME,

12:12.440 --> 12:14.150
I'D LIKE TO LEAVE ALL OF
MY WORLDLY POSSESSIONS

12:14.190 --> 12:15.310
TO A CHARITY...

12:15.360 --> 12:16.570
OF TINNY DOYLE'S CHOICE.

12:18.820 --> 12:20.070
[DES] OH, AND JAKE?
COULD YOU, UM,

12:20.110 --> 12:21.820
COULD YOU ERASE ALL OF MY
INTERNET HISTORY

12:21.860 --> 12:22.780
AND THE CACHE FROM MY LAPTOP?

12:22.820 --> 12:24.780
I JUST THINK SOME THINGS
COULD BE MISINTERPRETED

12:24.820 --> 12:25.910
GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

12:27.280 --> 12:28.660
OH, AND IN CASE ANYONE
WAS WONDERING,

12:28.700 --> 12:29.950
I'VE BEEN MURDERED
BY CARL MAHER.

12:32.040 --> 12:33.710
[♪]

12:34.120 --> 12:35.540
&lt; BUZZ &gt;

12:37.090 --> 12:38.500
[CARL] WHO ARE YOU?

12:38.550 --> 12:39.630
[DES] UH, UH, I'M DES.

12:39.670 --> 12:40.800

12:41.920 --> 12:43.430
[DES] I'M DES.

12:43.470 --> 12:45.010
[CARL] ARE YOU DES
OR ARE YOU NO ONE?

12:45.050 --> 12:46.680
[DES] I'M DES. JAKE SENT ME.

12:46.720 --> 12:48.640
[CARL] FINE.
COME ON INSIDE, THEN.

12:48.680 --> 12:49.770
&lt; CLICK &gt;

12:50.100 --> 12:51.140

12:57.230 --> 12:59.280
[CARL] OH, MY SON,
YOU SHOULD SEE YOUR FACE.
IT'S PRICELESS.

12:59.320 --> 13:00.730
[DES] JAKE WANTED ME TO...

13:00.780 --> 13:02.700
[CARL] BABYSIT THE DEAD MAN.
YES, I KNOWS, B'Y, I KNOWS.

13:02.740 --> 13:03.950
JUST YANKING YOUR CHAIN.
GET UP, GET UP.

13:06.990 --> 13:08.580
[CARL] YOU LIKE GUNS?

13:08.990 --> 13:10.410
[DES] SURE.

13:10.450 --> 13:12.040
[CARL] COME ON.

13:12.080 --> 13:13.460
[♪]

13:17.920 --> 13:19.670
[KATHLEEN] YEAH, ROSE
JUST LEFT HER PHONE BEHIND

13:19.710 --> 13:21.050
AND I THOUGHT MAYBE SHE
WAS OUT WITH YOU, SO,

13:21.090 --> 13:22.130
YEAH, I'LL JUST,

13:22.170 --> 13:23.970
I'LL JUST TRY
SOMEONE ELSE. THANKS.

13:24.010 --> 13:26.390
[JAKE] YOU WANNA TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON?

13:26.430 --> 13:28.850
[KATHLEEN] YOU KNOW WHAT?
MY PRADA PURSE IS MISSING,

13:28.890 --> 13:30.600
AND I THINK ROSE TOOK IT.

13:30.640 --> 13:32.180
[JAKE] YOU THINK THAT ROSE
STOLE YOUR PURSE?

13:32.220 --> 13:33.810
WHAT ARE YOU, A LUNATIC?

13:33.850 --> 13:35.980
[KATHLEEN] NO, I KNOW ROSE
DIDN'T STEAL MY PURSE,
ARSEHOLE,

13:36.020 --> 13:37.690
I THINK SHE
TOOK IT BY MISTAKE.

13:37.730 --> 13:38.940
[JAKE] SO WHAT IF SHE DID?

13:41.110 --> 13:43.030
[KATHLEEN] I HAVE DRUGS
IN THE PURSE, OKAY?

13:43.070 --> 13:45.650
YEP. THREE GRAMS OF HASH OIL.

13:45.700 --> 13:47.240
[JAKE] CAN YOU STILL
GET HASH OIL?

13:47.280 --> 13:48.820
[KATHLEEN] JAKE,
THIS IS REALLY SERIOUS.

13:50.410 --> 13:51.660
[JAKE] THREE GRAMS
OF HASH OIL.

13:51.700 --> 13:53.200
LOOK, I-- I'M SURE IT'S FINE,

13:53.250 --> 13:55.620
OKAY? ROSE IS
NO PRUDE, BELIEVE ME.

13:55.660 --> 13:56.870
[KATHLEEN] I GUESS I JUST
DON'T WANT HER THINKING

13:56.920 --> 13:58.080
I'M SOME SORT OF CRIMINAL,
YOU KNOW?

13:58.130 --> 13:59.210
&lt; CELL PHONE RINGING &gt;

13:59.250 --> 14:01.500
[JAKE] LOOK, RELAX, OKAY?

14:13.350 --> 14:14.890
I MAY END UP DEAD, JAKE.
DO YOU WANT THAT?

14:19.980 --> 14:21.110
[JAKE] ALRIGHT, I GOTTA GO.

FOUL PLAY WAS RULED OUT.

15:09.990 --> 15:11.820
THE DIVING TANKS AND GEAR

17:22.330 --> 17:24.460
[JAKE] WELL, I THOUGHT SOMEONE

17:24.500 --> 17:25.960
MAN, YOU MAHER'S...

17:26.000 --> 17:28.210
YOU'RE CERTAINLY GOOD
AT FAKING YOUR OWN DEATHS.

17:28.250 --> 17:29.750
[CRYSTAL] I GUESS I JUST
NEEDED YOUR ATTENTION.

17:29.800 --> 17:33.010
I WAS LONELY.
IS THAT SO BAD, JAKEY?

17:33.920 --> 17:35.220
[JAKE] WHERE'S OLIVE?

17:35.260 --> 17:36.760
[CRYSTAL] AH, DON'T WORRY.

17:36.800 --> 17:38.760
OLIVE IS OUT.

17:38.800 --> 17:40.100
IT'S JUST YOU...

17:41.810 --> 17:42.810
AND ME.

17:46.940 --> 17:48.230
[JAKE] GREAT.

ABOUT MY BROTHER.

17:53.900 --> 17:55.400
[JAKE] WELL,
AT LEAST YOU KNOW HE'S ALIVE.

17:55.450 --> 17:57.780
THERE MUST BE SOME
COMFORT IN THAT.

17:57.820 --> 17:59.320
[CRYSTAL] CARL THOUGHT OLIVE
WAS RUNNING AROUND

17:59.370 --> 18:01.160
WITH THAT ACCOUNTANT, BERT.

18:01.200 --> 18:02.240
[JAKE] REALLY?

18:02.290 --> 18:04.120
[CRYSTAL] HE THINKS THAT'S WHY
SHE WAS TRYING TO KILL HIM.

18:06.210 --> 18:07.960
[CRYSTAL] SO SHE AND
BERT COULD BE TOGETHER.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.840
[JAKE] YOU THINK THAT CARL
FAKED HIS OWN DEATH

18:09.880 --> 18:11.960
SO HE COULD EXACT...
REVENGE ON BERT.

18:13.880 --> 18:15.470
[CRYSTAL] HE'S GOT
A WICKED TEMPER.

18:15.510 --> 18:17.180
[JAKE] INDEED HE DOES.

18:17.220 --> 18:19.090
[CRYSTAL] CARL CHANGED
HIS WILL.

18:19.140 --> 18:20.800
HE LEFT ALL HIS MONEY TO ME.

18:21.970 --> 18:23.220
AS A SAFETY PRECAUTION.

18:23.270 --> 18:24.310
[JAKE] WELL...
[CRYSTAL]&lt; KISS &gt;

18:24.350 --> 18:25.890
[JAKE] I MEAN...

18:25.930 --> 18:27.690

18:27.730 --> 18:31.150
ISN'T HE WORRIED THAT
MAYBE YOU'LL SPEND IT ALL?

18:31.190 --> 18:33.110
[CRYSTAL] I'D HAVE TO
FIND IT FIRST.

18:33.150 --> 18:36.110
CARL DON'T BELIEVE IN BANKS.
GOD KNOWS WHERE IT'S STASHED.

18:36.150 --> 18:39.870
SO I WAS THINKING,
MAYBE YOU'D HELP A GIRL OUT.

18:41.490 --> 18:42.990
[JAKE] WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

18:43.040 --> 18:45.160
YOU WANT ME TO
ROB YOUR BROTHER

18:45.200 --> 18:47.040
WITH A SLEDGEHAMMER?

18:47.080 --> 18:48.750
[CRYSTAL] IT'S GOTTA BE
AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE.

18:48.790 --> 18:51.290
50-50, YOU AND ME.
OR WE COULD MAKE IT

18:51.340 --> 18:53.090
A PERMANENT PARTNERSHIP
AND RUN AWAY TOGETHER.

18:54.500 --> 18:56.760
[JAKE] OKAY, ISN'T THIS PLACE
LIKE FULL OF CAMERAS?

18:56.800 --> 18:58.260
[CRYSTAL] I WALK
AROUND NAKED...

19:00.260 --> 19:01.680
A LOT.
[JAKE] OKAY.

19:01.720 --> 19:03.640
[CRYSTAL] HE TURNS
THE CAMERAS OFF,

19:03.680 --> 19:06.770
SO WE CAN DO WHATEVER WE WANTS
AND NO ONE WILL SEE US.

19:07.940 --> 19:09.270
[JAKE/CRYSTAL]&lt; KISSING &gt;

19:09.310 --> 19:10.190
[JAKE] I MEAN...

19:10.230 --> 19:13.070
YOU BETRAYING YOUR BROTHER,
IT'S KIND OF ROTTEN.

19:13.110 --> 19:14.570
[CRYSTAL] DON'T MAKE
IT SOUND SO DIRTY.

19:15.530 --> 19:16.900
[MAL] AM I
INTERRUPTING SOMETHING?

19:16.940 --> 19:18.450
[JAKE] NO.

19:27.250 --> 19:30.370
[DES] AT FIRST, I THOUGHT CARL

19:30.420 --> 19:32.210
OR WHATEVER
WEIRD THING HE DOES, BUT UM--

19:32.250 --> 19:33.380

[JAKE] SO WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

20:18.510 --> 20:20.010

AN UNDEAD FUGITIVE FOREVER.

20:20.050 --> 20:21.260
[MAL] CARL THINKS
OLIVE AND BERT

20:21.300 --> 20:22.340
WERE HAVING AN AFFAIR.

[ROSE] YEAH, AND THIS.

24:59.740 --> 25:00.830
[JAKE] CARL.

25:00.870 --> 25:02.290
[CARL] WHAT?

25:02.330 --> 25:03.580
[JAKE] DID YOU KILL BERT?

25:03.620 --> 25:04.670
[CARL] NO.

25:04.710 --> 25:05.960
[JAKE] YOU SURE?
YOU TOLD US

25:06.000 --> 25:08.090
YOU THOUGHT THAT HE AND YOUR
WIFE WERE, YOU KNOW...

25:09.590 --> 25:11.090
[CARL] IF I WAS YOU, I'D BACK
RIGHT OFF, SIR.

25:11.130 --> 25:13.720
[MAL] COME ON CARL.
WE NEED TO KNOW.

25:13.760 --> 25:15.550
DID YOU THINK BERT AND
OLIVE WERE HAVING AN AFFAIR?

25:16.050 --> 25:17.550
&lt; PAPER CRINKLING &gt;

25:21.600 --> 25:23.640
[JAKE] WELL, THAT'S CLEARLY
HIM AND YOUR WIFE.

25:23.690 --> 25:27.940
[MAL] SO SHE LIED TO US WHEN
WE ASKED IF SHE SAW BERT
BEFORE HIS MURDER.

25:27.980 --> 25:29.770
[JAKE] CARL, YOU'RE A PRETTY
EXCITABLE GUY.

25:29.820 --> 25:31.440
I MEAN, I CAN SEE
YOU KILLING A FELLOW

25:31.480 --> 25:32.610

25:32.650 --> 25:33.860
[CARL] YEAH, YEAH. YEAH.

25:34.820 --> 25:37.450
YES. BUT I HAD NO PROOF.

25:37.490 --> 25:39.200
NOT ENOUGH TO KILL HIM.

25:39.240 --> 25:40.950
I WISH I WAS REALLY DEAD NOW.

25:40.990 --> 25:44.250
[MAL] CARL, WE'RE GOING TO
GO TO YOUR HOUSE,

25:44.290 --> 25:46.080
TALK TO OLIVE,
GET SOME CLARITY ON THIS.

25:46.120 --> 25:48.380
BUT CARL,
WE NEED YOU TO STAY HERE.

25:48.420 --> 25:49.750
[JAKE] UH, DAD?

25:50.250 --> 25:52.090
ALL DUE RESPECT, I MEAN,

25:52.130 --> 25:53.510
DO YOU REALLY THINK
THAT DES THERE,

25:53.550 --> 25:55.180
WE CAN COUNT
ON HIM TO KEEP CARL?

25:55.220 --> 25:56.380
[DES] AW.

25:56.630 --> 25:58.760

25:58.800 --> 26:00.890
[DES] NOW JAKE SAID TO STAY
IN THE VAN,

26:00.930 --> 26:02.470
AND STAY OUT OF HIS WAY.

26:02.520 --> 26:04.850
BECAUSE IF ANYONE SEES
YOU ALIVE, CARL MAHER,

26:04.890 --> 26:06.190
THEN THE JIG...

26:06.230 --> 26:07.310

26:07.350 --> 26:08.980
[CARL] OH.

26:09.020 --> 26:10.440

"YOU GOT IT SKIPPER."

26:10.480 --> 26:12.110
AND HE SAID,
"STOP CALLING ME THAT."

26:12.150 --> 26:15.650
AND I SAID, "JAKEY-BOY,
LITTLE JAKEY,WHY DON'T YOU
STOP WITH THE AGRO?".

26:15.700 --> 26:16.990
[CARL] REALLY?
[DES] YEAH.

26:17.030 --> 26:19.620
[CARL] DID YOU SAY THAT?
[DES] AFTER HE LEFT, I SAID...

26:19.660 --> 26:20.830
RIGHT AFTER... RIGHT AFTER...

26:20.870 --> 26:22.160
YOU WANT TO START THIS OFF?

26:22.200 --> 26:24.120
[DES] THAT STUFF IS VERY,
VERY BAD FOR YOUR BRAIN, CARL.

26:24.160 --> 26:25.710
[CARL] SO IS ALMOST
GETTING KILLED.

26:28.710 --> 26:30.000

27:03.790 --> 27:05.160
[MAL] OLIVE, WHAT DO YOU
KNOW ABOUT BERT'S DEATH?

27:05.200 --> 27:06.500
[OLIVE] BERT WAS A FRIEND.

27:06.540 --> 27:07.660
[CRYSTAL] WHAT KIND
OF A FRIEND?

27:07.710 --> 27:08.750
[OLIVE] OH, DON'T USE
THAT TONE WITH ME.

27:08.790 --> 27:10.000
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE IMPLYING.

27:10.040 --> 27:11.790
A MAN'S DEAD,
MY FRIEND IS DEAD,

27:11.840 --> 27:13.000

27:17.010 --> 27:18.680
[JAKE] OKAY, OLIVE,

TO SEE BERT ALIVE.

27:18.720 --> 27:20.680
[OLIVE] NO, I WASN'T.
I HAVEN'T SEEN BERT

27:20.720 --> 27:22.470
SINCE THIS MORNING WHEN HE
CAME BY WITH ERIN.

27:22.510 --> 27:23.760
[CRYSTAL] I WILL HIT YOU!

27:23.810 --> 27:25.140
[JAKE] YOU SURE
IT WASN'T LATER,

27:25.180 --> 27:26.730
WHEN YOU MET HIM
AT THE PAVING OFFICE?

27:26.770 --> 27:28.440
[OLIVE] ALL OF YOU
JUST LEAVE ME ALONE.

27:30.940 --> 27:32.400
[JAKE] WOULD YOU
GIVE ME THAT HAMMER?

27:32.440 --> 27:34.230
[CRYSTAL] DAMMIT JAKE,
I AM ENTITLED TO WHATEVER
IS IN THIS SAFE.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.710
THERE'S NO MONEY, NOTHING!

27:59.920 --> 28:02.470
HA! EXCEPT THIS.

28:05.100 --> 28:07.890
[JAKE] IT'S AN OPEN-ENDED
AIRLINE TICKET
IN CARL MAHER'S NAME.

28:07.930 --> 28:09.350
[MAL] HE'S PLANNING
A GET-AWAY.

28:09.390 --> 28:11.190
[CRYSTAL] SEE. I TOLD YOU.

THAT'S AN EXCELLENT CHOICE OF
WORDS, CARL. A FIRE.

29:28.470 --> 29:29.850
[CARL] THERE'S A FIRE IN HERE.

29:29.890 --> 29:31.390
[DES] IN MY HEART

29:31.430 --> 29:32.600
YEAH, YEAH, THERE'S FIRE.

29:44.950 --> 29:46.490
HOW DO YOU OPEN IT?

[JAKE] WELL, I THINK THAT
CARL'S CRAZY, OKAY?

31:02.480 --> 31:03.650
[KATHLEEN] DEAL.

31:05.860 --> 31:06.990
[KATHLEEN] UH, EXCUSE ME?
[WAITRESS] YEAH?

31:07.030 --> 31:08.570
[ROSE] VODKA. LOTS OF IT.
[WAITRESS] OKAY.

31:09.070 --> 31:10.620
[♪]

31:10.660 --> 31:12.870
[MAL] THAT VAN COST A LOT OF
MONEY.

31:12.910 --> 31:14.950
NOT TO MENTION THE FACT
THAT YOU ALMOST KILLED DES.

31:14.990 --> 31:16.750
[CARL] DES IS FINE.
[DES] NO, I'M NOT.

31:16.790 --> 31:19.250
[CARL] BESIDES, WAS I
CONTRACTED YOU TWO

31:19.290 --> 31:20.580
TO FIND OUT WHO WAS
TRYING TO KILL ME,

31:20.630 --> 31:22.250
AND THEY ALMOST SUCCEEDED
RIGHT UNDER YOUR NOSE.

31:22.290 --> 31:25.380
[JAKE] OR YOU'RE JUST A STONED
IDIOT WHO BLEW UP OUR VAN.

31:28.170 --> 31:29.430
[CARL] 75 GRAND, LOVE.

31:33.180 --> 31:34.010
[CARL] GO ON.
GO BUY A VAN NOW.

31:35.600 --> 31:36.720
ON ME.

31:36.770 --> 31:38.140
[JAKE] SO THAT'S WHERE
YOU'RE STASHING IT.

31:38.180 --> 31:40.100
YOU MIGHT WANT TO
TELL YOUR SISTER
AND SAVE HER THE TROUBLE.

31:40.140 --> 31:41.560
[CARL] WHAT'S THAT
S'POSED TO MEAN?

31:41.600 --> 31:43.940
[MAL] SHE'S BEEN SCOURING YOUR
HOUSE LOOKING FOR YOUR STASHED
MONEY, CARL.

31:43.980 --> 31:46.070
[CARL] YOU NEVER MIND
ABOUT MY SISTER.
WHY DON'T YOU DO YOUR JOB?

31:46.110 --> 31:48.440
[DES] JAKE!
I FEEL REALLY FUNNY.

31:48.490 --> 31:50.490
UH, I THINK CARL DRUGGED ME.

31:50.530 --> 31:52.370
I AM STARVING,
BUT I FEEL LIKE MY HANDS

31:52.410 --> 31:54.830
ARE TOO BIG TO GO INSIDE
A BAG OF CHIPS.

31:54.870 --> 31:56.080
HOW COULD THAT HAPPEN?

31:56.120 --> 31:58.290
I-- I DON'T DESERVE TO
FEEL THIS WAY.

31:58.830 --> 31:59.870
[CARL] DES.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.460
[JAKE] &lt; SIGH &gt;

32:02.500 --> 32:06.670
DO YOU EVER THINK MAYBE
NO ONE'S TRYING TO KILL YOU?

32:06.710 --> 32:08.380
[CARL] SO I IMAGINED
THIS WHOLE THING?

32:08.420 --> 32:10.050
[MAL] BE AN INTERESTING WAY
TO KILL BERT

32:10.090 --> 32:12.510
AND MAKE A CLEAN GETAWAY,
AND, UH,

32:12.550 --> 32:15.010
WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH
AN OPEN-ENDED AIRLINE TICKET?

32:15.050 --> 32:17.350
[CARL] BACK UP PLAN,
IN CASE YOU FOUND OUT THAT
OLIVE WAS THE ONE

32:17.390 --> 32:19.140
WHO WAS TRYING TO KILL ME,
I WAS GOING TO DISAPPEAR.

32:19.180 --> 32:22.310
[JAKE] ALRIGHT.
SAY YOU DIDN'T KILL BERT.

32:22.350 --> 32:24.610
I THINK IT'S SAFE TO
SAY WHOEVER DID

32:24.650 --> 32:26.190
IS THE ONE WHO'S AFTER YOU.

32:26.230 --> 32:29.190
I'LL GO DIG AROUND IN BERT'S
THINGS, SEE WHAT I CAN'T FIND.

32:29.240 --> 32:30.860
[MAL] I'LL STAY HERE
WITH CHEECH AND CHONG,

32:30.900 --> 32:32.700
MAKE SURE THEY DON'T
BURN DOWN THE OFFICE TOO.

32:34.120 --> 32:35.160
[JAKE] DES.&lt; SNAP &gt;

32:35.200 --> 32:36.450
[DES] WHA?

32:38.410 --> 32:39.830
WHA'S GOIN' ON?

32:39.870 --> 32:41.120
[JAKE] JUST COOL DOWN.
[DES] OKAY.

32:41.160 --> 32:42.960
[JAKE] I NEED YOU TO TAP INTO
CARL'S SECURITY CAMERAS.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.170
[DES] BUT JAKE, MY HANDS.

32:48.840 --> 32:50.210
[♪]

32:59.430 --> 33:01.060
&lt; DOOR SHUTTING &gt;

33:03.480 --> 33:05.190
[♪]

33:07.230 --> 33:09.280
[JAKE] BERT,
YOU'RE DRINKIN' AGAIN.

33:13.860 --> 33:15.990
[JAKE] "SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS,
ERIN AND BERT".

33:19.950 --> 33:21.120
&lt; CAR ENGINE &gt;

33:23.330 --> 33:25.420
[JAKE] OKAY, IT'S TIME THAT
YOU CAME CLEAN WITH ME.

33:25.460 --> 33:27.540
IF YOU WERE HAVING AN AFFAIR
WITH BERT AND,

33:27.590 --> 33:31.090
AND CARL FINDS OUT, HE'LL KILL
YOU AND HIMSELF.

33:31.840 --> 33:33.010
[OLIVE] CARL'S DEAD.

33:34.260 --> 33:36.050
[JAKE] NO, I KNOW THAT.
I MEAN...

33:36.090 --> 33:39.180
IF HE WAS ALIVE, HE'D BE
CAPABLE OF KILLING YOU
AND HIMSELF.

33:39.220 --> 33:41.970
[OLIVE] AND I WOULD
NEVER BETRAY HIM.
I LOVED HIM.

33:42.020 --> 33:44.140
[JAKE]&lt; SIGH &gt;OLIVE. LOOK.

33:46.770 --> 33:49.270
I KNOW YOU MET WITH BERT
JUST BEFORE HE DIED.

33:52.740 --> 33:54.900
[OLIVE] OKAY. I MET WITH HIM,

33:54.950 --> 33:56.660
BUT ONLY TO TELL HIM
TO BACK OFF.

33:56.700 --> 33:59.280
HE WAS PESTERING ME ABOUT
SELLING HIM MY SHARE
OF THE BUSINESS.

33:59.330 --> 34:01.540
[JAKE] SO WHY DIDN'T YOU
JUST SELL IT?

34:01.580 --> 34:03.290
[OLIVE] BECAUSE
SOMETHING FELT WRONG.

34:03.330 --> 34:05.330
I JUST-- IT WAS LOSING
ALL THAT MONEY,

34:05.370 --> 34:07.040
WHY WOULD HE WANT IT
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

34:07.750 --> 34:09.210
SO I LOOKED INTO IT...

34:10.460 --> 34:11.590
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

34:13.630 --> 34:16.760
BERT LIED. THE COMPANY
WAS MAKING A FORTUNE.

34:16.800 --> 34:19.100
AND HE WAS HIDING IT
FROM... CARL.

34:22.060 --> 34:23.430
[JAKE] WELL, NOW.

34:23.470 --> 34:25.480
[OLIVE] I JUST WISH I COULD...

34:25.520 --> 34:28.150
SEE CARL ONE MORE TIME,
YOU KNOW?

34:28.190 --> 34:29.440
I JUST WANTED HIM
SAFE AND HAPPY.

34:31.820 --> 34:33.280
[MAL] YOU KNOW, CARL...

34:34.860 --> 34:36.950
YOU GOT SOMETHING VERY FEW
PEOPLE EVER GET.

34:37.700 --> 34:38.780
[CARL] AND WHAT'S THAT?

34:38.820 --> 34:40.530
[MAL] A SECOND CHANCE
TO DO THINGS RIGHT.

34:41.950 --> 34:44.500
TAKE IT FROM SOMEONE WHO WAS
AS CLOSE TO DEATH AS YOU.

34:44.540 --> 34:45.960
[CARL] I DON'T THINK I LIKE
WHERE THIS IS GOING.

34:46.000 --> 34:50.250
[MAL] I'M JUST SAYING,
WHATEVER HAPPENS BETWEEN
YOU AND OLIVE,

34:50.290 --> 34:53.170
YOU JUST GOTTA MOVE ON WITH
LIFE, WITH OR WITHOUT HER.

34:53.210 --> 34:55.840
[CARL] I LOVE OLIVE.

34:55.880 --> 34:58.220
THE BUSINESS AND THE MONEY
AND ALL THAT, IT'S...

34:59.340 --> 35:01.930
IT JUST, IT DON'T MEAN NOTHING
UNLESS I GOT HER.

35:01.970 --> 35:03.930
SO I FIND OUT
SHE WAS BEHIND THIS...

35:05.140 --> 35:07.140
I MIGHT AS WELL
STAY DEAD, YOU KNOW?

35:07.180 --> 35:08.100
[JAKE] GOOD NEWS.

35:09.480 --> 35:11.150
YOUR BUSINESS
IS WORTH A FORTUNE.

35:11.190 --> 35:14.860
THE BAD NEWS, BERT'S BEEN
STEALING FROM YOU FOR YEARS,

35:14.900 --> 35:16.400
AND HE'S BEEN HIDING IT
IN THE PAPER WORK.

35:19.320 --> 35:20.570
[CARL] WHERE'D YOU GET THIS?

35:20.620 --> 35:22.280
[JAKE] OLIVE GAVE IT TO ME.

35:22.660 --> 35:23.870
[CARL] WHAT?

35:23.910 --> 35:26.080
[JAKE] SHE FOUND OUT THAT BERT
WAS RIPPING YOU OFF, MAN.

35:27.330 --> 35:28.710
[♪]

35:35.550 --> 35:37.590
[CARL] I GUESS IT'S TIME THAT
I BECAME UNDEAD THEN, RIGHT?

35:38.550 --> 35:40.840
I GOTTA GO SEE
MY WIFE, BOYS. WHA?

35:40.890 --> 35:42.600
COME ON, WE GO
AND SEE MY WIFE, COME ON.

35:43.680 --> 35:44.810
COME ON!

35:44.850 --> 35:45.930
HERE WE GOES.

35:46.390 --> 35:47.640
[♪]

35:52.560 --> 35:54.070
[CARL] WAIT A MINUTE...

35:55.320 --> 35:56.440
WAIT A MINUTE.
SOMETHING'S WRONG HERE.

35:56.480 --> 35:58.690
[MAL] KEEP QUIET. WE DON'T
WANT TO SCARE HER TO DEATH.

36:00.320 --> 36:02.700
[JAKE] OLIVE? IT'S JAKE.

36:02.740 --> 36:04.370
JAKE DOYLE.

36:04.410 --> 36:06.330
[LESLIE] JAKE, MALACHY,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

36:06.370 --> 36:07.450
[JAKE] WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

36:07.500 --> 36:09.620
[LESLIE] WE GOT A CALL.
OLIVE'S MISSING.

36:09.660 --> 36:10.960
[CARL] MY WIFE'S MISSING?
WHERE IS SHE?

36:12.710 --> 36:14.000
[LESLIE] CARL MAHER?

36:15.040 --> 36:16.750
[♪]

36:20.510 --> 36:21.800
[CARL] WHAT?

36:22.260 --> 36:24.550
[♪]

36:26.310 --> 36:29.020
[LESLIE] FAKING YOUR OWN DEATH
IS A SERIOUS OFFENSE,
MR. MAHER.

36:29.060 --> 36:30.730
AND YOU CROWD
ARE ALL ACCESSORIES.

36:30.770 --> 36:32.140
[CARL] I DON'T CARE ABOUT ME.

36:32.190 --> 36:33.230
YOU CAN LOCK ME UP
IF YOU WANTS,

36:33.270 --> 36:35.360
BUT IF MY WIFE'S MISSING
YOU GOTTA GO FIND HER.

36:35.400 --> 36:37.440
[LESLIE] MAYBE SHE
RAN OFF INTO THE SUNSET,

36:37.480 --> 36:38.730
AFTER SHE KILLED BERT ANTLE.

36:38.780 --> 36:40.400
[CARL] THE MOUTH ON YOU!

36:40.440 --> 36:44.240
[LESLIE] LISTEN, SINCE YOU
DECIDED TO PLAY DEAD,
YOU'VE LOST ALL CREDIBILITY.

36:44.280 --> 36:45.910
[MAL] CARL THINKS SOMEONE
IS TRYING TO KILL HIM.

36:45.950 --> 36:48.040
[JAKE] HE DECIDED TO PRETEND
THAT THEY SUCCEEDED

36:48.080 --> 36:50.580
UNTIL WE COULD FIGURE OUT
WHO WAS ACTUALLY
TRYING TO KILL HIM.

36:50.620 --> 36:52.210
[LESLIE] SO WHO IS IT?

36:52.250 --> 36:54.960
[JAKE] WE HAVEN'T...
FIGURED THAT OUT YET.

36:55.000 --> 36:57.800
[LESLIE] ALRIGHT. WELL, THAT'S
A BRILLIANT STRATEGY THEN.

36:57.840 --> 36:59.800
[MAL] BUT WHOEVER IT WAS,
THEY COULD HAVE TAKEN OLIVE.

36:59.840 --> 37:01.260
[CARL] THAT'S RIGHT.
SHE'S IN DANGER.

37:01.300 --> 37:03.380
[LESLIE] I SAID, WE'RE GOING
TO LOOK INTO IT.

37:03.430 --> 37:05.640
[CARL] SERGEANT,
I SWEAR ON A STACK OF BIBLES

37:05.680 --> 37:07.220
THAT THEM TWO HAD
NOTHING TO DO WITH IT,

37:07.260 --> 37:09.220
SO LET THEM GO AND FIND
MY WIFE, WOULD YA?

37:11.730 --> 37:13.810
[LESLIE] GO ON.
GET OUT OF HERE.

37:13.850 --> 37:15.400
NOW!

37:16.440 --> 37:19.360
[CARL] BOYS, YOU FIND OLIVE,
AND YOU MAKE SURE SHE'S ALIVE.

37:19.400 --> 37:20.780
AND YOU TELL HER I'M SORRY.

37:20.820 --> 37:21.900
AND THAT I LOVES HER.

37:21.940 --> 37:22.950
[LESLIE] TIME TO GO.

37:24.780 --> 37:25.950
[JAKE] LET'S GO.

37:25.990 --> 37:27.240
&lt; CAR ENGINE STARTING &gt;

37:27.580 --> 37:28.830
[♪]

37:31.410 --> 37:33.460
[JAKE] HEY THERE, UH, ERIN.

37:33.500 --> 37:34.370
[ERIN] WHY? WHY WOULD
HE DO THAT,

37:34.420 --> 37:36.420
PRETEND TO BE DEAD LIKE
THAT? IT'S HORRIBLE.

37:36.460 --> 37:38.210
[MAL] HE WAS TRYING TO FIGURE
OUT WHO TRIED TO KILL HIM.

37:38.250 --> 37:41.300
[ERIN] I'M... JUST SO GLAD
HE'S ALIVE.

37:42.340 --> 37:43.420
CAN'T WAIT TO SEE HIM.

37:45.970 --> 37:47.180
[JAKE] HEY!

37:47.220 --> 37:48.430
HOOD! HOOD!

37:49.850 --> 37:50.970
HEY, HOW YOU DOING?

37:51.020 --> 37:52.390
LISTEN, HATE TO BOTHER YOU.

37:52.430 --> 37:56.150
WE JUST REALLY WANT
TO SEE BERT ANTLE'S
TOXICOLOGY REPORT.

37:56.190 --> 37:59.020
[HOOD] AND I WANT BANGS,
BUT THAT AIN'T GONNA HAPPEN.

37:59.070 --> 38:00.360
[MAL] IT'S A BIT OF AN
EMERGENCY, DAN.

38:01.570 --> 38:03.320
[HOOD] FOR YOU, MAL.

38:03.360 --> 38:06.570
HE WAS POISONED. SOME WEIRD
CONCOCTION OF NARCOTICS.

38:06.610 --> 38:07.780
DROPPED HIM LIKE AN ELEPHANT.

38:09.370 --> 38:11.040
[JAKE] UH, THANKS A LOT, HOOD.

38:12.410 --> 38:15.120
[MAL] CRYSTAL MAHER WAS PRETTY
HANDY WITH THAT SYRINGE.

38:15.160 --> 38:16.290
[JAKE] LET'S GO.

38:17.710 --> 38:19.340
&lt; CAR ENGINE &gt;

38:19.380 --> 38:20.420

38:25.880 --> 38:27.550
[MAL] HEADING ON VACATION?

38:27.590 --> 38:30.260
MOST HOTELS
COME FURNISHED, FYI.

38:30.300 --> 38:31.600
[CRYSTAL] JUST TAKING
MY INHERITANCE.

38:31.640 --> 38:34.560
[JAKE] YOU DO KNOW THAT
HE'S REALLY ALIVE, RIGHT?

38:34.600 --> 38:36.690
[CRYSTAL] SO DOES EVERYONE,
THANKS TO THE TWO OF YOU.

38:36.730 --> 38:38.940
I GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE
BEFORE THE COPS THINK
I'M AN ACCESSORY.

38:38.980 --> 38:40.310
[JAKE] OR A MURDERER.

38:40.360 --> 38:41.360
[CRYSTAL] WHAT?

38:41.400 --> 38:43.230
[JAKE] BERT WAS POISONED.
NOW DAD, WHO DO WE KNOW

38:43.280 --> 38:47.110
THAT LOOKS REALLY GOOD
IN A BLUE DRESS AND
LIKES TO PLAY CHEMIST?

38:47.150 --> 38:48.780
[MAL] YOU DRUGGED
US UP PRETTY GOOD.

38:48.820 --> 38:50.370
[CRYSTAL] WHAT?
YOU DON'T THINK...

38:52.990 --> 38:55.750
[CRYSTAL] I DIDN'T KILL
ANYONE... YET.

38:55.790 --> 38:58.250
BUT IF YOU FOLLOW ME,
THAT MIGHT CHANGE.

38:59.000 --> 39:00.580
[♪]

39:03.630 --> 39:04.760
&lt; PHONE RINGING &gt;

39:04.800 --> 39:05.800
[JAKE] NOW WHAT?

39:08.680 --> 39:10.800
[DES] YO, JAKE-O, SKIPPER-O.

39:10.850 --> 39:12.510
I THINK I FOUND OUT
SOMETHING FOR YA.

39:12.560 --> 39:13.600
[JAKE] WHAT?

39:13.640 --> 39:16.180
[DES] CARL MAHER WAS
RELEASED ON BAIL.

39:16.230 --> 39:18.770
[JAKE] OKAY, GOOD. DID YOU TAP
INTO CARL'S SECURITY CAMERAS?

39:18.810 --> 39:20.400
[DES] SO I TAPPED INTO
CARL'S SECURITY FOOTAGE.

39:21.060 --> 39:22.440
[JAKE] AND?

39:22.480 --> 39:24.070
[DES] THAT MISSUS, ERIN,

39:24.110 --> 39:26.570
SHE'S AT CARL'S BUNKER
WITH CARL.

39:27.530 --> 39:28.610
[JAKE] OKAY, GOOD.

39:28.650 --> 39:29.910
[DES] WAIT, NO, NO, NO.

39:29.950 --> 39:31.870
BUT OLIVE IS WITH THEM,
AND THEY'RE ALL
TIED UP AND STUFF.

39:34.160 --> 39:35.290
[MAL] WHAT?

39:35.330 --> 39:37.200
[JAKE] WE GOTTA GO.

39:37.250 --> 39:39.250
[ERIN] I DIDN'T MEAN
FOR ANY OF THIS TO HAPPEN.

39:39.290 --> 39:40.830
I DIDN'T. IT ALL JUST...

39:40.880 --> 39:42.590
SPUN OUT OF CONTROL.

39:43.420 --> 39:45.300
[CARL] ERIN, MY DUCKY,

39:45.340 --> 39:46.710
JUST LET HER GO. ALRIGHT?

39:46.760 --> 39:48.550
YOU CAN DO WHATEVER
YOU WANT WITH ME. C'MON.

39:48.590 --> 39:50.430
[OLIVE] NO.
WE ARE GOING OUT
OF HERE TOGETHER.

39:50.470 --> 39:52.090
[ERIN] I'M NOT LETTING
EITHER OF YOU GO.

39:53.720 --> 39:55.260
[CARL] WHY'RE YOU DOING THIS?

39:55.310 --> 39:56.890
[ERIN] LOOK, EVERYTHING
WAS FINE

39:56.930 --> 39:58.930
UNTIL WE THOUGHT
YOU WERE DEAD, CARL.

39:58.980 --> 40:00.850
YOU WERE JUST ABOUT TO
SELL TO BERT AND ME.

40:00.900 --> 40:02.610
[OLIVE] SO YOU DIDN'T
TRY TO KILL CARL?

40:02.650 --> 40:04.650
[ERIN] NO. I HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH THAT.

40:04.690 --> 40:06.190
[CARL] SO WHY'RE YOU
TRYING TO KILL ME NOW?

40:06.230 --> 40:08.070
