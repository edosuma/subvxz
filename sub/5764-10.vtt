00:01.939 --> 00:03.973
Hi! am i late?

00:04.041 --> 00:06.375
No, i was early. hi.
sorry!

00:06.443 --> 00:09.045
Chief resident let me get
out a couple hours before.

00:09.113 --> 00:11.280
Well, i would have
been here sooner,

00:11.348 --> 00:12.782
But i couldn't get
out of the house.

00:12.850 --> 00:14.650
I just kept
going back
for one more hug.

00:14.718 --> 00:15.952
You know,
it's the first time

00:16.018 --> 00:17.386
We've left aiden
since...

00:17.454 --> 00:20.223
I know,
since he went missing.

00:20.290 --> 00:23.226
But a little
separation anxiety,
that's normal, right?

00:23.293 --> 00:24.727
Absolutely normal.
he'll be fine.

00:24.795 --> 00:26.429
Especially
with delia sitting.

00:26.497 --> 00:29.365
It's...
[sighs[

00:31.201 --> 00:33.469
I know that the shadows
haven't been back.

00:33.537 --> 00:35.338
Just--

00:35.405 --> 00:36.906
I don't know,
i keep thinking

00:36.974 --> 00:38.941
Maybe they're
waiting for us
to let our guard down.

00:39.009 --> 00:40.743
Honey, that's not
going to happen.

00:40.811 --> 00:42.645
It'll be fine.

00:42.713 --> 00:45.615
So, aiden.
any separation anxiety
on his side?

00:45.682 --> 00:46.749
No.

00:46.817 --> 00:48.784
He couldn't wait
for me to leave

00:48.852 --> 00:50.553
So that he could
show his aunt delia
his magic tricks.

00:50.621 --> 00:53.523
That's because
he's like his mother--

00:53.590 --> 00:55.525
Gifted and resilient.

00:55.592 --> 00:58.361
Where is eli?

00:58.428 --> 01:00.263
I don't care.

01:00.330 --> 01:02.231
oh.

01:02.299 --> 01:05.635
Hi, eli. we were
just wondering
where you are.

01:05.702 --> 01:07.103
sorry.

01:07.171 --> 01:08.704
The behaviorists got into it
with the freudians

01:08.772 --> 01:10.273
At the faculty meeting.

01:10.340 --> 01:11.741
It wasn't pretty.

01:11.808 --> 01:13.876
I'll be right there.

01:13.944 --> 01:16.012
Uh-oh,
i spoke too soon.

01:16.079 --> 01:17.113
What do you mean?

01:17.181 --> 01:18.714
I'm being busted
by the five-oh.

01:18.782 --> 01:19.982
What?!

01:20.050 --> 01:21.417
Smokey's on my tail.

01:21.485 --> 01:23.686
You're getting
pulled over?

01:23.754 --> 01:25.454
ok,
you know what,

01:25.522 --> 01:26.822
It's probably
your tail light.

01:26.890 --> 01:29.192
i'll never
survive in prison.

01:29.259 --> 01:30.326
I've been
telling you
for a week

01:30.394 --> 01:31.527
To get that
thing fixed.

01:31.595 --> 01:33.763
Please tell me
you'll visit me
in the pokey.

01:33.830 --> 01:35.598
Eli, you're not
going to jail.

01:35.666 --> 01:37.500
You're just
getting a ticket.

01:37.568 --> 01:39.202
ringside seats.

01:39.269 --> 01:40.670
Fantastic.

01:40.737 --> 01:42.205
Yeah.

01:42.272 --> 01:45.408

cbs studios, inc.

01:54.351 --> 01:56.185
You know why
i stopped you?

01:56.253 --> 01:58.521
If it's about
the coffee filters
i stole from work,

01:58.589 --> 01:59.589
I'll bring 'em back,
i swear.

01:59.656 --> 02:01.357
No, sir,
it's your taillight.

02:01.425 --> 02:04.060
I know. coffee filters
thing was a joke.

02:04.127 --> 02:05.761
You think
this is funny?

02:05.829 --> 02:07.096
A little.

02:07.164 --> 02:08.396
No?

02:08.465 --> 02:10.098
No.

02:10.167 --> 02:11.434
Step out
of the vehicle.

A field sobriety test?
is he drunk?

02:24.414 --> 02:25.348
No.

02:25.415 --> 02:27.483
He's just eli.

02:30.621 --> 02:34.290
Oh, i would give anything
to know what he's saying
to that cop.

02:36.059 --> 02:40.396
I would like to know
what that cop has
a ghost in his backseat.

02:41.665 --> 02:43.466
Be right back.

02:45.802 --> 02:48.237
So did i pass, or...

02:48.305 --> 02:51.474
I'm writing you a ticket
for your taillight.

02:51.541 --> 02:53.276
seriously?

02:53.343 --> 02:54.443
You can't just
give me a warning

02:54.511 --> 02:55.444
And let me be on
my merry way?

02:55.512 --> 02:56.545
Tell him
to shut up.

02:56.613 --> 02:59.282
Who?
me?

03:00.651 --> 03:02.184
What are you doing?

03:04.121 --> 03:06.222
Uh...

03:06.290 --> 03:08.691
I'm friends
with dr. james.

03:08.759 --> 03:11.627
Step back.

03:11.695 --> 03:13.062
This doesn't concern you.

03:14.264 --> 03:15.298
Do what he says.

03:16.767 --> 03:19.335
He's a killer
with a badge.

03:26.543 --> 03:28.611
Child, whispering:
can you see us?

03:28.612 --> 03:35.612
Sync by honeybunny
www.addic7ed.com

03:58.079 --> 03:59.546
Thanks for coming in.

04:05.418 --> 04:06.652
Let me guess--

04:06.669 --> 04:09.037
Detective blair wouldn't
take care of your ticket.

04:09.105 --> 04:11.340
Can you believe it?
she wouldn't even
come down on the price.

04:11.407 --> 04:13.108
She actually
told me i should
cut officer ramsey

04:13.176 --> 04:14.710
Some slack 'cause
he's been through
a lot lately.

04:14.777 --> 04:16.678
Meaning the shooting
he was involved in.

04:16.745 --> 04:18.512
Is that
what it was?

04:18.581 --> 04:19.880
Blair didn't
give me any details.

04:19.949 --> 04:20.983
She just said
he was on a leave
of absence.

04:21.050 --> 04:22.251
How'd you find out?

04:22.318 --> 04:23.452
I called the station
and asked

04:23.519 --> 04:26.054
If he'd ever killed anybody
in the line of duty.

04:26.122 --> 04:28.023
Just like that?

04:28.091 --> 04:29.191
Jeez.
mm-hmm.

04:29.259 --> 04:30.892
Blair's been
holding out on me.

04:30.960 --> 04:33.962
And here i thought
we bonded because i told
her about our gift.

04:34.030 --> 04:36.999
Anyway, ramsey
didn't kill anyone
but his partner did,

04:37.066 --> 04:38.934
And he just happened
to be there when it happened.

04:39.002 --> 04:40.836
This guy, todd moresco.

04:40.903 --> 04:42.337
He's our ghost?

04:42.405 --> 04:43.705
Well, i didn't get
a good enough look at him,

04:43.773 --> 04:45.240
But he's definitely
in the running.

04:45.308 --> 04:47.242
"meth addict shot during
routine traffic stop.

04:47.310 --> 04:49.811
"officer luis simon shot
and killed todd moresco

04:49.879 --> 04:52.080
When the suspect turned
a gun on his partner,
officer ramsey."

04:52.148 --> 04:53.248
Whoa.

04:53.316 --> 04:55.951
Yeah, ramsey went on
a six-month leave of absence.

04:56.019 --> 04:57.819
You think he did
something wrong
during the shooting?

04:57.887 --> 04:59.254
The ghost does.
either way,

04:59.322 --> 05:00.956
He's only been back to work
for a few of weeks.

05:01.024 --> 05:02.557
Ok, well,
if moresco's our ghost,

05:02.625 --> 05:05.661
Why is he haunting
ramsey and not
the guy who shot him?

05:05.728 --> 05:07.462
Maybe he's haunting them both.

05:09.332 --> 05:11.099
It's so nice of you
to do this.

05:11.167 --> 05:12.501
You know what,
it's not a problem.

05:12.568 --> 05:14.536
We usually have a bunch
of these neighborhood
watch packets,

05:14.604 --> 05:15.704
But i guess
we ran out.

05:15.805 --> 05:18.206
Oh. it's a dangerous world,
even here.

05:18.274 --> 05:20.175
Well, we have to keep
grandview safe.

05:20.243 --> 05:22.110
And we appreciate it.

05:22.178 --> 05:24.813
Oh.

05:24.881 --> 05:26.782
Officer simon.

05:26.849 --> 05:30.252
I'm sorry. i didn't
recognize your name
from the paper.

05:30.320 --> 05:32.220
The drug addict,
the one that you...

05:32.288 --> 05:34.623
Well, you shot him,

05:34.691 --> 05:36.958
Right? and he died?

05:37.026 --> 05:39.661
That's right.

05:40.897 --> 05:42.764
Must be hard
to move past
something like that.

05:42.832 --> 05:44.299
Well, it is what it is,
you know?

05:44.367 --> 05:47.069
I don't like to second guess
decisions i make on the job.

05:47.136 --> 05:49.604
So you're not
haunted by it?

05:49.672 --> 05:51.873
No, i'm not.

05:51.941 --> 05:53.809
Well, i'm sure during
the investigation

05:53.876 --> 05:55.977
They figured out
that you didn't do
anything wrong.

05:56.045 --> 05:57.346
Well, my partner and i
were both cleared.

05:57.413 --> 05:58.380
It was a righteous shoot.

05:58.448 --> 06:00.515
Your partner, he took
a leave of absence.

06:00.583 --> 06:02.284
He did, but it wasn't
a disciplinary move.

06:02.352 --> 06:03.618
It was personal,
you know.

06:03.686 --> 06:05.354
He had a hard time
dealing with what happened.

06:05.421 --> 06:07.556
Harder than you?
different.

06:07.623 --> 06:08.924
See, i didn't
have a choice.
i had to shoot.

06:08.991 --> 06:11.493
Moresco had a gun
pointed at my partner's head.

06:11.561 --> 06:12.994
But for doug,
it was different.

06:13.062 --> 06:14.730
It was his gun.

06:14.797 --> 06:16.798
I didn't know that.

06:16.866 --> 06:18.567
It all happened so quick.

06:18.634 --> 06:20.569
You know, one second
he's telling this junkie
to get out of the car.

06:20.636 --> 06:22.804
The next thing you know,
the guy's got doug's gun.

06:22.872 --> 06:24.806
I can't imagine it.

06:24.874 --> 06:27.008
It's the worst thing
that can happen to a cop.

06:27.076 --> 06:28.744
Having his gun
turned on him?

06:28.811 --> 06:29.778
Especially a guy like doug.

06:29.846 --> 06:31.880
He's tough,
always in control.

06:31.948 --> 06:33.982
You know, he prided
himself on the fact

06:34.050 --> 06:35.817
He never fired his weapon
in the line of duty.

06:35.885 --> 06:39.855
The fact that it was his gun
that forced me to fire...

06:42.158 --> 06:44.092
Look, everything's here.

06:44.160 --> 06:46.895
You're all set to go.

06:46.963 --> 06:48.597
Thank you.
yeah.

06:48.664 --> 06:50.532
Hey, anne-marie.

06:50.600 --> 06:52.567
How are you?
i didn't realize

06:52.635 --> 06:53.835
It was so late.

06:53.903 --> 06:55.604
Where's doug?

06:55.671 --> 06:58.707
Your father went to get
a ballistics report
at the lab.

06:58.775 --> 07:00.075
He should have
been back there
a half hour ago.

07:00.143 --> 07:01.843
But he'll be here
any minute.

07:01.911 --> 07:03.245
Great.

07:03.312 --> 07:06.548
You're not an officer
here, too, are you?

07:07.617 --> 07:10.018
I'm in high school.

07:10.086 --> 07:12.087
This is anne-marie ramsey.

07:12.155 --> 07:14.022
It's my partner's daughter.

07:14.090 --> 07:16.091
Oh, hi.
i'm melinda gordon.

07:18.494 --> 07:20.595
Ok, so,
if we're done here,
why don't we just--

07:20.663 --> 07:21.863
You know, it's just
really nice

07:21.931 --> 07:24.199
That you come by
and visit your father
after school.

07:24.267 --> 07:25.801
More like
report to.

07:25.868 --> 07:28.370
Nice would be
sipping a skinny
vanilla latte

07:28.438 --> 07:30.405
On the square
with my friends.

07:31.507 --> 07:35.110
Oh. well.

07:35.178 --> 07:36.344
Bye.

07:46.189 --> 07:47.722
Take it to the impound,
thanks.

07:47.790 --> 07:49.324
Will do, officer.

07:53.296 --> 07:54.296
Hey!

07:55.898 --> 07:57.065
Hey!

07:57.133 --> 07:59.000
No, no, no! wait!

07:59.068 --> 08:00.302
Wait, that's my car!

08:00.369 --> 08:01.503
Please!

08:03.005 --> 08:04.172
That's my car!

08:06.075 --> 08:08.176
?but tonight,
can't i go... ?

08:08.244 --> 08:09.478
Mmm.

08:09.545 --> 08:10.879
Don't worry
about the car.

08:10.947 --> 08:11.913
I'll go down
to the impound lot

08:11.981 --> 08:13.382
And straighten out
as much as i can.

08:13.449 --> 08:15.283
It just must've been
some sort of mix-up,

08:15.351 --> 08:17.185
Because it said
that my tags had expired,

08:17.253 --> 08:18.220
But i always renew.

08:18.287 --> 08:19.688
You know,
i remember

08:19.756 --> 08:21.490
That the registration
stickers came in the mail

08:21.557 --> 08:22.691
And i thought
i left them on
the kitchen counter.

08:22.759 --> 08:24.826
Maybe i tossed them
by mistake.

08:24.894 --> 08:26.194
I don't know.

08:26.262 --> 08:27.929
It's just weird to see
your car like that,
you know?

08:27.997 --> 08:28.930
And then,
i almost missed it

08:28.998 --> 08:30.999
Because officer ramsey
was talking

08:31.067 --> 08:32.501
To the tow truck driver.

08:32.568 --> 08:33.602
Ramsey was there?

08:33.669 --> 08:35.837
Yeah, why?

08:35.905 --> 08:37.139
Nothing. it's
probably just--

08:37.206 --> 08:38.673
Just a coincidence.

08:38.741 --> 08:39.908
What do you mean?

08:39.976 --> 08:41.710
Well, don't you think
it's a little strange,

08:41.778 --> 08:43.044
You're asking questions
about a cop

08:43.111 --> 08:44.413
And then that
very same cop shows up

08:44.480 --> 08:46.448
When the car gets towed?

08:46.516 --> 08:49.184
What? you think
officer ramsey's trying
to send me a message?

08:49.252 --> 08:51.753
I think most cops
are hard-working guys
with a tough job,

08:51.821 --> 08:54.389
But there is
the occasional bad egg.

08:56.626 --> 08:57.559
You know
what i'm saying.

08:57.627 --> 08:59.294
Yeah.

08:59.362 --> 09:00.796
Yeah, i'll be careful.

09:25.688 --> 09:27.656
Officer ramsey:
hey, what the hell
is wrong with you?!

09:27.723 --> 09:29.925
Get back here!

09:32.261 --> 09:34.930
whoo! yeah!

09:45.107 --> 09:47.175
You're not
todd moresco.
who are you?

09:54.116 --> 09:55.851
He wanted revenge

09:55.918 --> 09:57.586
And he got it.

10:12.246 --> 10:14.147
oh! you are the best.

10:14.214 --> 10:16.182
Ah, it's the least
i could do after
hijacking your car

10:16.250 --> 10:17.483
For the whole day.
thank you.

10:17.551 --> 10:19.686
Besides, i need your
help with something.

10:19.753 --> 10:20.820
I found my ghost.

10:20.888 --> 10:22.989
His name is
dylan hale.

10:23.057 --> 10:26.859
Oh, that's the kid
from grandview high
who died last month.

10:26.927 --> 10:27.994
You're sure it's him?

10:28.062 --> 10:29.729
Positive. he gave me
a vision last night.

10:29.797 --> 10:31.631
And you know
he was admitted here
before he died.

10:31.699 --> 10:33.499
Of course, which is
why i need you
to ask around,

10:33.567 --> 10:34.834
And find out
what really
happened to him.

10:34.902 --> 10:36.769
Skateboarding accident.
hit his head.

10:36.837 --> 10:38.538
There was no
skateboarding
in my vision.

10:38.606 --> 10:40.239
What did you see?

10:40.307 --> 10:41.841
Dylan was in a car.

10:41.909 --> 10:44.177
He was driving past
officer ramsey's house.

10:44.244 --> 10:48.114
Ramsey was angry, and i
mean, really angry.

10:48.182 --> 10:49.215
And i'm just
starting to wonder

10:49.283 --> 10:50.717
If the skateboarding
story is a cover up.

10:50.784 --> 10:52.418
For what?

10:52.486 --> 10:53.753
I don't know,
but if ramsey's the guy

10:53.821 --> 10:55.021
Who brought that kid
into the er,

10:55.089 --> 10:56.723
Then maybe we're taking
the wrong person's word

10:56.790 --> 10:58.091
For what
really happened.

10:58.158 --> 10:59.092
Whoa, whoa.

10:59.159 --> 11:00.893
You think a cop
hurt this kid?

11:00.961 --> 11:02.395
Dylan seems to.

11:02.463 --> 11:03.496
I mean,
he's a cop, right?

11:03.564 --> 11:04.864
They--they're
people.

11:04.932 --> 11:05.965
There can be good
ones, bad ones.

11:06.033 --> 11:07.600
Yeah, but, i mean,
killing a kid?

11:07.668 --> 11:10.236
Look, he went
back to work right
before dylan died.

11:10.304 --> 11:11.771
Maybe he went back
too soon.

11:12.773 --> 11:13.840
You're thinking ptsd?

11:13.907 --> 11:15.441
That would make
a man volatile.

11:15.509 --> 11:18.111
I just want to know
where that skateboarding
story came from.

11:19.780 --> 11:22.215
Ok, i will find out
as much as i can.

11:22.282 --> 11:23.349
Thank you.

11:23.417 --> 11:25.518
After i get
your car outta hock.

11:32.626 --> 11:34.193
Hey, uh, buddy.

11:34.261 --> 11:36.562
Um, i've been waiting,
like, 20 minutes
for this car to come out.

11:36.630 --> 11:38.297
Do you think--
you should talk to him.

11:38.365 --> 11:40.633
Sorry. thanks.

11:40.701 --> 11:42.802
Hey.
hey.

11:44.038 --> 11:46.773
Don't tell me.
you couldn't find the car.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.808
No, we found it.

11:48.876 --> 11:51.344
Good. thanks.

11:51.412 --> 11:54.313
Thing is, your car
was accidentally tagged
for a drug search.

11:54.381 --> 11:56.449
What?

11:56.517 --> 11:58.484
It kinda got stripped.

11:58.552 --> 11:59.585
Down to the frame.

11:59.653 --> 12:01.654
What do you mean,
down to the frame?

12:01.722 --> 12:03.523
You know your
steering wheel,

12:03.590 --> 12:04.891
Seats, stereo
system, stuff
like that?

12:04.958 --> 12:05.892
Right.

12:05.959 --> 12:08.061
They're
pretty much gone.

12:08.128 --> 12:09.429
Tell me you're kidding.

12:09.496 --> 12:11.097
Sorry, bro,
it's no joke.

12:11.165 --> 12:14.100
But it was totally
our bad, so you will
get reimbursed.

12:14.168 --> 12:15.101
Yeah.

12:15.169 --> 12:17.036
You know, my wife
really liked this car.

12:17.104 --> 12:19.572
At least she'll
get to go shopping
for a new one.

12:21.308 --> 12:22.475
All right, thanks.
yeah.

12:22.543 --> 12:24.210
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

12:24.278 --> 12:26.713
You said
that someone told you

12:26.780 --> 12:29.148
Accidentally to strip
my wife's car?

12:29.216 --> 12:30.149
Yeah.

12:30.217 --> 12:31.451
Who?

12:31.518 --> 12:33.586
That, i don't know.

12:33.654 --> 12:35.154
There's no paperwork
on it,

12:35.222 --> 12:36.556
Which is one
of the reasons

12:36.623 --> 12:37.824
Why we realized
it was a mistake.

12:39.126 --> 12:41.494
A mistake, huh?
yeah.

12:41.562 --> 12:42.695
All right.

12:42.763 --> 12:44.397
Thanks.

12:44.465 --> 12:45.765
Yeah.

12:50.904 --> 12:52.805
he made a mistake?

12:52.873 --> 12:55.208
So, he killed my car?

12:56.410 --> 12:57.977
All right. you know
what? that's personal.

12:58.045 --> 13:00.379
I just think you need
to be more careful,
that's all.

13:00.447 --> 13:01.514
Melinda, on phone:
don't worry about it.

13:01.582 --> 13:03.583
I know how
to handle this guy.

13:08.288 --> 13:09.388
Phew.

13:11.525 --> 13:13.259
Officer ramsey?

13:13.327 --> 13:14.727
Hi. melinda gordon.

13:14.795 --> 13:16.462
We met over there
the other night.

13:16.530 --> 13:18.498
Did dr. james get
his tail light fixed?

13:18.565 --> 13:20.133
Oh, you scared him
straight.

13:20.200 --> 13:21.300
You have a knack
for that.

13:21.368 --> 13:22.902
Good to know.

13:22.970 --> 13:24.804
Which is what i'm hoping
that you will do

13:24.872 --> 13:26.472
With the skateboarders
around here,

13:26.540 --> 13:28.474
'cause they're always
in front of my store.

13:28.542 --> 13:30.109
Mostly kids, teenagers.

13:30.177 --> 13:31.410
And you're
concerned about?

13:31.478 --> 13:32.812
Safety.

13:32.880 --> 13:34.747
Especially after that--

13:34.815 --> 13:37.016
That young kid died
in a skateboarding accident.

13:37.084 --> 13:38.951
I don't think
most skateboarding
accidents

13:39.019 --> 13:39.952
Are that serious.

13:40.020 --> 13:41.954
Still.

13:42.022 --> 13:43.256
How's his family doing?

13:43.323 --> 13:44.457
I wouldn't know.

13:44.525 --> 13:46.259
That death wasn't
a police matter.

13:46.326 --> 13:47.460
It was an accident,
not a crime.

13:47.528 --> 13:49.662
No, no, right.

13:49.730 --> 13:51.063
Right. it's just
i had--i had heard

13:51.131 --> 13:52.865
That he was in trouble
with the law?

13:52.933 --> 13:54.534
Not that i know of.

13:54.601 --> 13:56.469
Not here in
grandview anyway.

13:56.537 --> 13:58.604
And not that
it makes his death
any less tragic.

13:58.672 --> 14:01.207
No, i--i didn't
mean that.

14:05.846 --> 14:08.214
Ms. gordon.

14:08.282 --> 14:11.484
I've been patrolling
the square for almost
a month now

14:11.552 --> 14:13.452
And i haven't noticed
any skateboarders.

14:20.494 --> 14:22.228
Ahh! that is
a sandwich.

14:24.064 --> 14:25.364
Eli, come right in.

14:25.432 --> 14:27.033
Hello.

14:27.100 --> 14:29.769
Well, since i figured
you're a one-car household

14:29.837 --> 14:31.204
And i just happened
to be passing by,

14:31.271 --> 14:33.072
I wanted to see
if you needed a ride
back to the hospital.

14:33.140 --> 14:34.207
Oh, thanks.

14:34.274 --> 14:36.042
I'm working a double.
it's the worst.

14:36.109 --> 14:39.345
I was going to ride
my bike, but since
you were, um,

14:39.413 --> 14:41.247
Just passing by?

14:41.315 --> 14:42.815
My wife put you up
to this, didn't she?

14:42.883 --> 14:45.017
She felt bad
about monopolizing your car.

14:45.085 --> 14:46.919
You heard what happened,
didn't you?

14:46.987 --> 14:48.321
They didn't
just tow her car.

14:48.388 --> 14:49.522
They trashed it.

14:49.590 --> 14:51.557
I know. who knew
mistakes like that
could happen?

14:51.625 --> 14:54.327
I don't think
anybody made
a mistake.

14:54.394 --> 14:55.628
What do you mean?

14:56.964 --> 14:59.732
I don't want to sound
like i'm overreacting,

14:59.800 --> 15:01.567
But you stirred
something up.

15:01.635 --> 15:03.236
Me?

15:03.303 --> 15:04.237
You and melinda.

15:04.304 --> 15:05.738
Well, that's
kinda what we do.

15:05.806 --> 15:07.940
We stir things up
and then cross them over.

15:08.008 --> 15:08.941
Something like that.

15:09.009 --> 15:10.376
Eli, i'm serious, ok?

15:10.444 --> 15:11.577
I used to be
a paramedic.

15:11.645 --> 15:13.713
I know a little bit
about cops and how
they work.

15:13.780 --> 15:15.781
Any way you slice this,
there could be trouble.

15:15.849 --> 15:17.617
Ramsey's haunted
for a reason.

15:17.684 --> 15:19.118
Well, let me try
to say it simply.

15:19.186 --> 15:20.887
If ramsey's a good cop,

15:20.954 --> 15:22.822
He's gonna do
a lot to protect his
reputation, all right?

15:22.890 --> 15:23.923
If he's bad cop--

15:23.991 --> 15:25.658
Who might have
possibly killed a kid.

15:25.726 --> 15:27.093
A high school kid.
right.

15:27.160 --> 15:29.428
I hear you.
i'm not saying
stand by and do nothing.

15:29.496 --> 15:31.564
No, you're saying
just don't play games
with my wife's safety.

15:31.632 --> 15:33.532
Yeah, yeah.
i am saying that.

15:37.037 --> 15:38.304
I worry about her, ok?

15:38.372 --> 15:39.705
So do i.

15:41.508 --> 15:42.541
I know.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.277
No, listen. jim.
melinda's my best friend.

15:44.344 --> 15:45.544
I know.

15:45.612 --> 15:46.612
No, you don't.

15:48.949 --> 15:51.884
I haven't had a friend
like that since i was
12 years old.

15:51.952 --> 15:53.219
Someone who
i've looked up to

15:53.287 --> 15:55.421
And i can learn
things from.

15:55.489 --> 15:57.723
I don't want
anything bad to happen
to her, either.

15:57.791 --> 16:00.793
Well then,
hurry up and figure out
what this ghost wants.

16:00.861 --> 16:03.729
Because if this
car thing's a message
from ramsey,

16:03.797 --> 16:05.431
He's on to her.

16:05.499 --> 16:06.666
And you.

16:08.769 --> 16:11.270
He didn't even
bat an eye when i
mentioned dylan.

16:11.338 --> 16:12.338
And this was
after my car

16:12.406 --> 16:13.739
Was mysteriously
destroyed.

16:13.807 --> 16:15.274
I mean, he is
one cool customer.

16:15.342 --> 16:17.343
Maybe he's
not a cool customer.

16:17.411 --> 16:18.711
Maybe he's just innocent.

16:18.779 --> 16:20.012
Seriously?

16:20.080 --> 16:22.248
Since when did
you become a fan
of officer ramsey's?

16:22.316 --> 16:23.716
Since never.

16:23.784 --> 16:24.917
But it's possible
he was telling
the truth

16:24.985 --> 16:27.053
About dylan not having
a juvie record.

16:27.120 --> 16:29.255
So, maybe they didn't
know each other.

16:29.323 --> 16:30.456
Look.

16:30.524 --> 16:32.758
I just talked
to detective blair
10 minutes ago.

16:32.826 --> 16:34.327
She told me
off the record.

16:34.394 --> 16:36.095
Whatever happened
between them,

16:36.163 --> 16:37.129
It's personal.

16:37.197 --> 16:38.531
That's why dylan
was at his house

16:38.598 --> 16:40.833
And that's why
he said that ramsey is
out for revenge.

16:40.901 --> 16:42.201
Were they neighbors?

16:42.269 --> 16:43.402
Lots of neighbors
hate each other.

16:43.470 --> 16:44.971
No, i checked.

16:45.038 --> 16:46.839
And they lived across
town from each other.

16:46.907 --> 16:48.574
Well, maybe it was
some sort of family feud.

16:48.642 --> 16:50.209
Family feud?

16:50.277 --> 16:52.078
Yeah.

16:52.145 --> 16:53.546
Wait a minute. family.

16:53.613 --> 16:56.282
He has a daughter.
she's in high school.

16:56.350 --> 16:57.550
What if she and dylan
were dating

16:57.617 --> 16:59.452
And that's how he got
on ramsey's bad side?

16:59.519 --> 17:01.253
And then some.

17:01.321 --> 17:03.823
Wow. so,
hats off to dylan.

17:03.890 --> 17:06.325
It takes a lot of cojones
to date a cop's daughter.

17:11.631 --> 17:13.933
Ok, i'll call
you later.

17:14.001 --> 17:14.934
Hi.

17:15.002 --> 17:16.902
Hi. uh, i'm melinda gordon.

17:16.970 --> 17:19.204
Yeah, we met down
at the station.

17:19.271 --> 17:21.140
I didn't think i made
a very good impression.

17:21.208 --> 17:22.540
Sorry about that.

17:22.608 --> 17:24.542
That place
kinda brings out
the worst in me.

17:24.611 --> 17:25.944
It's ok.

17:27.580 --> 17:29.648
Sometimes my dad
just gets to me.

17:29.716 --> 17:32.918
He's way overprotective,
you know?

17:32.986 --> 17:35.855
My dad wasn't exactly
the hands-on type, so.

17:35.922 --> 17:37.023
Lucky you.

17:37.090 --> 17:39.492
If dad could have me
home-schooled,
he would.

17:39.559 --> 17:41.227
Thankfully he works,
and my mom,

17:41.294 --> 17:42.928
She took off
a long time ago,

17:42.996 --> 17:44.463
So he's got no choice.

17:44.531 --> 17:46.499
He has to uncage me
for school.

17:48.201 --> 17:50.803
Did you need directions
to the main office
or anything?

17:50.871 --> 17:52.471
No, actually, i was
hoping to run into you,

17:52.539 --> 17:54.173
'cause i wanted
to talk to you.

17:54.241 --> 17:56.308
Yeah? what about?

17:56.376 --> 17:57.510
Dylan hale.

17:57.577 --> 18:00.079
The kid who died
in the skateboarding accident?

18:01.448 --> 18:03.749
What? why?

18:03.817 --> 18:05.718
Did you know him?

18:05.786 --> 18:06.886
Everybody did.

18:06.953 --> 18:08.421
It's not exactly
a big school.

18:10.323 --> 18:11.957
Anne-marie,
i understand.

18:12.025 --> 18:13.059
About your dad.

18:13.126 --> 18:14.226
Being on your case
all the time.

18:14.294 --> 18:16.162
It had to have
been hard on you.

18:16.229 --> 18:17.329
Both of you.

18:17.397 --> 18:18.697
I don't know
what you're
talking about.

18:18.765 --> 18:20.199
Were you and dylan dating?

18:20.267 --> 18:21.834
No.

18:21.902 --> 18:23.102
Look, i gotta go.

18:24.704 --> 18:26.806
Ok, look. wait.

18:29.076 --> 18:30.776
This is going to sound
really strange,

18:30.844 --> 18:33.045
But i have a gift.

18:33.113 --> 18:34.513
I see ghosts.

18:34.581 --> 18:36.415
And i've seen
dylan's.
what?

18:36.483 --> 18:37.817
He doesn't
belong here

18:37.884 --> 18:39.418
And there is a reason
that he can't move on,

18:39.486 --> 18:40.786
And i think you know
what it is.

18:40.854 --> 18:43.022
Stop it.
please. he needs
your help.

18:43.090 --> 18:45.591
I told you.

18:45.659 --> 18:47.526
I don't know what you're
talking about.

19:27.094 --> 19:28.294
I mean,
she couldn't wait
to get away from me.

19:28.362 --> 19:29.495
That's when
she dropped it.

19:29.563 --> 19:31.263
You think dylan
gave her this thing?

19:31.331 --> 19:32.798
It has to have
some significance.

19:32.866 --> 19:34.300
I mean, i saw him get
clubbed in the head.

19:34.368 --> 19:35.601
It was so violent.

19:35.669 --> 19:37.002
You're sure it was
a cop's nightstick?

19:37.070 --> 19:38.537
Well, i mean, it all
happened so fast,

19:38.605 --> 19:39.772
But that's what
it looked like.

19:39.840 --> 19:41.273
But you didn't see
officer ramsey's face.

19:41.341 --> 19:42.441
No. just the stick.

19:42.509 --> 19:44.176
I just wish i knew
where to go from here.

19:44.244 --> 19:45.277
I checked around,
and it turns out

19:45.345 --> 19:46.846
One of his friends
brought dylan into the e.r.

19:46.913 --> 19:48.381
A kid named jake olmstead.

19:48.448 --> 19:50.516
Yeah, he's the one
who said it was
a skateboarding accident?

19:50.584 --> 19:52.184
That's what he said.
he just wiped out
at the park.

19:52.252 --> 19:53.886
What about dylan,
what'd he say?

19:53.954 --> 19:54.954
Nothing.

19:55.021 --> 19:56.622
He was barely conscious
before he died.

19:56.690 --> 19:59.792
Why would his friend
lie to protect
officer ramsey?

19:59.860 --> 20:00.993
Look, i don't know, honey.

20:01.061 --> 20:02.762
Now, i know you really want
to help this ghost,

20:02.829 --> 20:04.864
But i really
don't want you to take
unwarranted risks.

20:04.931 --> 20:06.799
And if this guy ramsey
killed a kid,

20:06.867 --> 20:08.067
And he's already trashed
your car--

20:08.135 --> 20:09.535
I'll stay
out of trouble.

20:09.603 --> 20:11.170
Don't i always?

20:14.541 --> 20:15.808
Not really.

20:17.310 --> 20:19.111
Dr. james, come in.

20:19.179 --> 20:20.546
Thanks for calling.

20:20.614 --> 20:22.181
I've been reading
your work.

20:22.249 --> 20:23.682
Didn't know i had fans.

20:23.750 --> 20:25.184
Eh.

20:25.252 --> 20:28.654
I've been studying
how adolescents process
the death of a peer.

20:28.722 --> 20:30.689
Well, how're
the students
handling the loss?

20:30.757 --> 20:33.058
Eh, a lot of them
are struggling.

20:33.126 --> 20:34.827
Some come for help.
others...

20:34.895 --> 20:37.530
Wouldn't step a foot
through the door.

20:37.597 --> 20:41.133
What about the kids
who knew dylan well?
you know?

20:41.201 --> 20:43.769
Like his friend
who was with him when
the accident happened.

20:43.837 --> 20:45.771
Jake olmstead. right.

20:45.839 --> 20:47.873
Uh, checking in
with jake's still on
my to do list.

20:47.941 --> 20:49.141
Were they tight?

20:49.209 --> 20:51.243
No, actually.

20:51.311 --> 20:54.113
Jake and dylan
were on opposite ends
of the social hierarchy,

20:54.181 --> 20:55.648
With dylan pretty much
at the bottom.

20:55.715 --> 20:57.950
So dylan was
a shoved-in-your-
own-locker kind of kid?

20:58.018 --> 20:59.485
Not quite, no.

20:59.553 --> 21:00.586
He was a loner.

21:00.654 --> 21:02.621
Troubled family life.

21:02.689 --> 21:05.124
Acted out.
spent a lot of time
in the principal's office.

21:05.192 --> 21:06.392
And jake?

21:07.461 --> 21:08.494
Straight arrow.

21:08.562 --> 21:10.496
Baseball jock,
but with a brain.

21:10.564 --> 21:13.499
Plus, everyone likes him.

21:13.567 --> 21:15.634
How about dylan's
girlfriend?

21:15.702 --> 21:17.169
How's she dealing
with this?

21:17.237 --> 21:19.338
He had a girlfriend?

21:19.406 --> 21:21.607
Well, weren't he
and anne-marie
ramsey an item?

21:21.675 --> 21:23.008
You know anne-marie?

21:23.076 --> 21:25.177
I kinda know her dad.

21:25.245 --> 21:27.947
Huh.

21:28.014 --> 21:29.415
You got me.

21:29.483 --> 21:31.750
It's hard to keep track
of the hook-ups.

21:31.818 --> 21:33.652
Don't think
i ever saw her
with dylan, though.

21:33.720 --> 21:34.687
Jake, sometimes.

21:34.754 --> 21:36.655
But not dylan.

21:38.492 --> 21:39.725
You know, i don't mean
to overstep,

21:39.793 --> 21:44.163
But if you could
use a hand,

21:44.231 --> 21:46.198
I'd be more than happy
to donate my therapy
services

21:46.266 --> 21:47.399
For a couple of hours
a week, you know?

21:47.467 --> 21:48.901
Just until
things calm down.

21:50.270 --> 21:51.770
I'd need to clear it
with the administration,

21:51.838 --> 21:52.872
But of course.

21:52.939 --> 21:54.139
That's very generous.

21:54.207 --> 21:56.475
I could start by talking
to jake olmstead.

21:56.543 --> 21:57.610
Great.

22:01.414 --> 22:02.648
that's him.

22:02.716 --> 22:04.283
I recognize him
from the team photo.

22:08.922 --> 22:10.422
Jake, right?

22:10.490 --> 22:12.424
I'm dr. eli james.
and this is
melinda gordon.

22:16.329 --> 22:17.630
What do you want?

22:17.697 --> 22:19.331
I'm working
with mitch larson.

22:19.399 --> 22:20.366
I'm a psychologist.

22:20.433 --> 22:21.534
A grief counselor.

22:21.601 --> 22:22.768
I don't need a shrink.

22:22.836 --> 22:24.036
You sure about that?

22:24.104 --> 22:25.571
Weren't you
with dylan hale
the night he died?

22:27.207 --> 22:28.140
Who told you that?

22:28.208 --> 22:30.309
It was in
the hospital records.

22:30.377 --> 22:32.411
Losing a friend can
be very traumatic.

22:32.479 --> 22:33.879
It helps
to talk about it.

22:33.947 --> 22:35.347
Look, i don't want
to talk to you.

22:38.451 --> 22:39.385
I'm fine.

22:39.452 --> 22:41.854
And i'm late
for practice.

22:44.925 --> 22:46.425
I can see why
he's so popular.

23:07.080 --> 23:09.315
You just got something
off that car, didn't you?

23:09.382 --> 23:11.183
Good car.

23:11.251 --> 23:13.419
I think those kids
are harassing
officer ramsey.

23:13.486 --> 23:15.254
You're sure it's not
the other way around?

23:15.322 --> 23:16.622
How can they harass him?

23:16.690 --> 23:17.990
Vandalism.

23:18.058 --> 23:20.225
And i'm not just
talking about,
like, tping trees.

23:20.293 --> 23:21.827
It was vicious.

23:21.895 --> 23:23.128
They tore apart
his house.

23:23.196 --> 23:24.196
Wow.

23:24.264 --> 23:25.965
Take one cop feeling shamed
and powerless

23:26.032 --> 23:27.433
After a shooting incident,

23:27.500 --> 23:29.234
Add a little ptsd,

23:29.302 --> 23:30.736
And pow!

23:30.804 --> 23:33.138
Vandalism like that
could've pushed him
over the edge.

23:41.815 --> 23:44.149
You're late.

23:44.217 --> 23:46.719
Where the hell
have you been?

23:46.786 --> 23:48.621
What difference
does it make?

23:48.688 --> 23:50.189
I'm your father.

23:52.826 --> 23:53.759
Who you been with?

23:53.827 --> 23:55.060
None of your
damn business.

23:55.128 --> 23:56.562
Don't talk to me
like that.

23:56.630 --> 23:58.831
You want to know
where i was so bad?

23:58.898 --> 24:01.734
I was at
a candlelight vigil
for dylan hale.

24:01.801 --> 24:03.702
Now, why would you
do that?

24:03.770 --> 24:04.937
You didn't even know him.

24:05.005 --> 24:06.572
Everybody was there.

24:06.640 --> 24:07.840
It would have looked
weird if i didn't go.

24:07.907 --> 24:10.709
I don't care
what it looks like.

24:10.777 --> 24:12.177
I saw you talking
to that woman.

24:12.245 --> 24:13.178
What woman?

24:13.246 --> 24:14.947
Melinda gordon.

24:15.015 --> 24:16.248
What'd you say to her?

24:16.316 --> 24:17.916
It's none
of your business.

24:20.920 --> 24:22.788
It is my business.

24:22.856 --> 24:24.690
You are my business.

24:24.758 --> 24:26.759
I didn't
say anything.

24:26.826 --> 24:28.193
Now, leave me alone.

24:30.997 --> 24:32.131
Who's out there?

24:32.198 --> 24:34.667
Which one of your idiot
friends is outside?

24:41.007 --> 24:42.374
Dylan?

24:45.011 --> 24:46.178
What did you say?

24:46.246 --> 24:48.480
What's the difference?

24:48.548 --> 24:50.949
It's done.

24:51.017 --> 24:52.551
Nothing will
bring him back.

24:55.722 --> 24:58.624
Hey.

24:58.692 --> 25:01.260
Gotta watch your
step now more than
ever, anne-marie.

25:03.296 --> 25:05.731
I don't want
my little girl
getting hurt.

25:14.951 --> 25:16.651
Pb & j, your favorite.

25:16.719 --> 25:17.986
No trading, ok?

25:18.054 --> 25:20.522
Not even if abby
has maple syrup?

25:20.590 --> 25:22.691
Maple syrup?
for lunch?

25:22.759 --> 25:24.226
What is that?

25:24.293 --> 25:25.727
That's my sticker book.

25:27.096 --> 25:28.830
Aiden!

25:28.898 --> 25:29.931
Those are
mommy's car tags.

25:29.999 --> 25:31.266
Where did you
get these?

25:31.334 --> 25:33.902
From daddy. he left them
on the counter for me.

25:33.970 --> 25:35.604
He knows i like
shiny stickers.

25:35.671 --> 25:37.105
Aren't they cool?

25:37.173 --> 25:39.941
Yes, very cool.

25:40.009 --> 25:41.843
All right, out
to the bus stop.
come on.

25:41.911 --> 25:43.078
I'm gonna hold on
to that.

25:45.181 --> 25:46.281
There you go.

25:46.349 --> 25:48.717
All right?
let me see you.

25:48.785 --> 25:49.751
Mwah. handsome.

25:49.819 --> 25:51.987
Knock 'em dead,
big guy.
you, too.

25:52.054 --> 25:52.988
I'll walk you to the bus
in a second, honey.

25:53.055 --> 25:53.989
Ok, mommy.

25:54.056 --> 25:55.991
Eli the chauffeur,
at your service.

25:56.058 --> 25:59.027
Look where
the registration tags
for my car have been,

25:59.095 --> 26:00.028
Aiden's sticker book.

26:00.096 --> 26:01.430
So they really
were expired?

26:01.497 --> 26:03.732
Yeah, and i thought
ramsey had had
my car got towed.

26:03.800 --> 26:05.233
Well, he's still the reason
it got shredded.

26:05.301 --> 26:07.202
I'm not sure about that.

26:07.270 --> 26:09.571
'cause jim said
that he was poking
around the hospital,

26:09.639 --> 26:11.206
Asking a bunch of
questions about dylan,

26:11.274 --> 26:13.575
And if he had done
something, wouldn't
he have known?

26:13.643 --> 26:14.910
Could be he's trying
to figure out

26:14.977 --> 26:16.211
If anyone knew
he was involved.

26:16.279 --> 26:17.412
Yeah, i don't know
about that.

26:17.480 --> 26:18.680
Didn't you get
my text?

26:18.748 --> 26:20.081
I hadn't checked today.

26:20.149 --> 26:22.083
Oh, well,
jim also found out

26:22.151 --> 26:24.186
That ramsey came
to pick up
dylan's things.

26:24.253 --> 26:25.821
His clothes,
skateboard.

26:25.888 --> 26:27.456
Anything that he had
brought with him
at the hospital.

26:27.523 --> 26:28.690
Wait. dylan's parents
didn't do that?

26:28.758 --> 26:30.559
Apparently not.

26:30.626 --> 26:33.028
What if he's getting rid
of incriminating evidence?

26:33.095 --> 26:34.796
Look, weeks
after the accident?

26:34.864 --> 26:36.198
Look, remember,
i told you

26:36.265 --> 26:38.433
I didn't actually
see ramsey hit him
with the nightstick.

26:41.971 --> 26:42.971
Dylan.

26:43.039 --> 26:44.372
Why don't you
believe it? he did it.

26:44.440 --> 26:45.974
He's guilty.

26:46.042 --> 26:47.809
I just think
there's more to
the story than that.

26:47.877 --> 26:49.144
You don't understand.

26:49.212 --> 26:51.413
You vandalized
his house.
you tormented him.

26:51.481 --> 26:52.714
He had it coming.

26:52.782 --> 26:55.417
No one has the right
to come between people
like he did.

26:55.485 --> 26:57.185
Not when they're in love.

26:59.689 --> 27:01.089
Hello?

27:01.157 --> 27:02.390
Hey, mitch.

27:02.458 --> 27:03.658
Yeah, of course,
i remember you.

27:03.726 --> 27:05.861
You're my newest--
well, maybe my only--fan.

27:05.928 --> 27:08.663
No, i haven't had a chance
to talk to her yet. why?

27:10.099 --> 27:12.067
Ok, thanks.

27:12.134 --> 27:13.535
Anne-marie hasn't been
to school in 2 days.

27:15.404 --> 27:16.872
Has anyone talked
to her father?

27:16.939 --> 27:19.541
They called the house,
no answer. why?

27:19.609 --> 27:20.842
hopefully nothing,

27:20.910 --> 27:22.143
Except he saw me
talking to her

27:22.211 --> 27:23.678
And he didn't
look pleased.

27:28.117 --> 27:29.551
Give me a second.

27:34.724 --> 27:36.625
Ms. gordon, i don't
have time right now --

27:36.692 --> 27:37.926
I don't want
to start any trouble,

27:37.994 --> 27:39.127
But it's about
your daughter.

27:39.195 --> 27:40.195
What about her?

27:40.263 --> 27:42.130
She's missed school
2 days in a row.

27:42.198 --> 27:43.632
You're tracking my kid's
whereabouts now?

27:43.699 --> 27:45.867
I just want
to make sure she's ok.

27:45.935 --> 27:47.836
I'll deal with it.

27:50.006 --> 27:51.473
Look, she's troubled
about something

27:51.541 --> 27:52.574
And i think i can help.

27:52.642 --> 27:54.643
I don't. now if
you'll excuse me,

27:54.710 --> 27:56.111
I'm in the middle
of an investigation.

27:56.178 --> 27:58.280
Yeah, is that why
you have dylan's things?

27:58.347 --> 28:00.015
Last time
i asked you about him

28:00.082 --> 28:02.450
You said that his death
was an accident, not a crime.

28:02.518 --> 28:04.553
You said that you
didn't know anything.

28:11.294 --> 28:12.928
You need to leave.

28:14.830 --> 28:17.198
Yeah, ok.

28:17.266 --> 28:18.266
Sorry.

28:20.002 --> 28:22.170
Eli, on phone:
what do you mean,
it wasn't a nightstick?

28:22.238 --> 28:23.638
It looked like a nightstick,

28:23.706 --> 28:25.173
But it was actually
a baseball bat.

28:25.241 --> 28:27.375
Ramsey beat dylan's head
in with a baseball bat?

28:27.443 --> 28:29.110
Melinda, on phone:
not ramsey. jake.

28:29.178 --> 28:31.079
Clean-cut
jock jake? why?

28:31.147 --> 28:32.080
I don't know.

28:32.148 --> 28:33.582
The ghost said
something about

28:33.649 --> 28:34.583
If people
love each other,

28:34.650 --> 28:35.817
They should be together.

28:35.885 --> 28:37.018
Eli, on phone:
you're thinking

28:37.086 --> 28:38.219
This is how jake
stopped their romance?

28:38.287 --> 28:41.022
By whacking
his competition
in the skull?

28:41.090 --> 28:42.991
It seems unlikely,
i know.

28:43.059 --> 28:46.428
And if that's true,
why has dylan been
blaming officer ramsey?

28:46.495 --> 28:47.796
I don't know, and i'd like
to talk to jake,

28:47.863 --> 28:49.664
But i don't have a car.

28:49.732 --> 28:51.566
I'll come by the store
after my next class.

28:51.634 --> 28:53.234
Teach quick. bye.

28:53.302 --> 28:54.569
Surprise!
surprise!

28:56.973 --> 28:58.139
Hi!

28:58.207 --> 28:59.441
Oh, my gosh.

28:59.508 --> 29:01.743
check--
check it out, mom.

29:01.811 --> 29:04.212
It's an acadia.

29:04.280 --> 29:05.213
Oh, my goodness.

29:05.281 --> 29:06.481
It's got a remote.

29:06.549 --> 29:08.283
And a camera
so you won't
back into anything.

29:08.351 --> 29:10.051
Nice.

29:10.119 --> 29:11.753
it's got
3 rows of seats, too.

29:11.821 --> 29:14.689
So we can carpool with
my whole soccer team.

29:14.757 --> 29:15.724
Oh, great.

29:15.791 --> 29:17.425
Yeah.

29:17.493 --> 29:18.760
come on in.

29:18.828 --> 29:20.128
I know how much
you loved that old car,

29:20.196 --> 29:22.397
But i just remember
it took you about
a year to pick it,

29:22.465 --> 29:23.598
So, i hope you
don't mind if we --

29:23.666 --> 29:24.933
Mind? why
would i mind?

29:25.001 --> 29:26.635
And i love you.

29:26.702 --> 29:28.103
Both of you.

29:28.170 --> 29:30.138
I'm sorry
about your old car.

29:30.206 --> 29:32.107
I didn't know they were
stickers for grown-ups.

29:32.174 --> 29:33.608
It's ok.

29:33.676 --> 29:34.643
We did good?

29:34.710 --> 29:35.944
You did great.

29:36.012 --> 29:37.412
Listen, tonight,
when i get home,

29:37.480 --> 29:38.847
We'll all
take a drive
together, ok?

29:38.914 --> 29:41.716
For now,
there's somebody
i need to talk to.

29:41.784 --> 29:42.751
Go crazy.

29:42.818 --> 29:44.052
Yay!
all right.

29:44.120 --> 29:45.186
I love you,
i love you.
i love you.

29:45.254 --> 29:46.888
Ooh, i can't believe
this is for me!

29:46.956 --> 29:48.490
Here, pal.
hang on to that.

29:51.127 --> 29:52.093
Ok.

29:52.161 --> 29:53.762
i'm excited!

29:53.829 --> 29:55.730
I love you both.

29:55.798 --> 29:57.132
Good-bye.
love you.

30:03.072 --> 30:04.072
Well?

30:04.140 --> 30:05.507
We did good.

30:07.476 --> 30:08.443
Looks like
we're walking, pal.

30:08.511 --> 30:10.478
Ok.
come on.

30:21.090 --> 30:23.191
Hi. um, my name
is melinda gordon,

30:23.259 --> 30:24.592
I'm looking
for jake.

30:24.660 --> 30:25.760
He's not home yet.

30:25.828 --> 30:28.196
But i'm bonnie, his mom.
can i help you?

30:32.535 --> 30:33.935
I think i've seen you
at the school before.

30:34.003 --> 30:35.470
You're one of the moms,
aren't you?

30:37.139 --> 30:38.707
Is that how
you knew dylan?

30:38.774 --> 30:40.408
I've only
met him recently.

30:40.476 --> 30:41.443
His death was
a shock.

30:41.510 --> 30:44.345
Oh, i know.
it was awful.

30:44.413 --> 30:45.480
His parents
still haven't come

30:45.548 --> 30:46.948
For the last
of his things.

30:47.016 --> 30:47.949
His things?

30:48.017 --> 30:49.250
He'd been
living with us.

30:49.318 --> 30:50.518
After his parents
kicked him out.

30:50.586 --> 30:52.420
Oh. i had no idea.

30:52.488 --> 30:55.223
I didn't even know
he and jake
were friends.

30:55.291 --> 30:57.092
They were
and they weren't.

30:57.193 --> 30:58.126
They used
to play together

30:58.194 --> 31:00.328
Because i was friends
with his mom.

31:00.396 --> 31:02.464
When did they start
growing apart?

31:02.531 --> 31:04.766
I suppose
that was my doing.

31:04.834 --> 31:05.767
His father drank,

31:05.835 --> 31:07.435
And when he did,
he was abusive.

31:07.503 --> 31:08.536
To dylan?

31:08.604 --> 31:10.672
I think so.

31:10.740 --> 31:12.273
Dylan started
acting out.

31:12.341 --> 31:15.610
I couldn't blame him,
and i couldn't fix
his situation at home,

31:15.678 --> 31:18.279
But i could keep it away
from my child.

31:18.347 --> 31:19.914
So you pulled away.

31:19.982 --> 31:21.916
And jake stayed away.
he got good grades,

31:21.984 --> 31:23.151
He got into sports.

31:23.219 --> 31:25.220
And dylan...

31:25.287 --> 31:27.021
Fell off the map.

31:27.089 --> 31:29.958
But i guess
he remembered us
being kind to him.

31:30.025 --> 31:31.259
Jake, too.

31:31.327 --> 31:33.261
Because when jake learned
he needed a place to crash,

31:33.329 --> 31:35.363
He invited dylan here,
and he accepted.

31:35.431 --> 31:37.599
That must've meant
a lot to him.

31:37.666 --> 31:39.267
So, how did they do
living together?

31:39.335 --> 31:40.602
Good, i guess.

31:40.669 --> 31:42.070
At first i was worried

31:42.138 --> 31:43.738
Dylan was going to be
a bad influence,

31:43.806 --> 31:46.908
Especially
when jake came home
with speeding tickets.

31:46.976 --> 31:49.944
But it turns out that
was my fault, not dylan's.

31:50.012 --> 31:51.246
What do you mean?

31:51.313 --> 31:53.414
Jake was getting serious
about a girl.

31:53.482 --> 31:55.283
And i didn't realize
how serious

31:55.351 --> 31:58.052
Until i found a box
of condoms in his room.

31:58.120 --> 32:00.955
Unopened, but still.

32:01.023 --> 32:03.591
So i called
the girl's dad.

32:03.659 --> 32:04.726
Maybe it
would've gone better

32:04.794 --> 32:05.860
If i could've talked
to her mom,

32:05.928 --> 32:07.195
But her mom's
not around, so--

32:07.263 --> 32:09.197
The girl was
anne-marie ramsey?

32:09.265 --> 32:10.298
You know her?

32:10.366 --> 32:11.900
Her father, too.

32:11.967 --> 32:13.601
Hmm. yes, well,
he threatened to have

32:13.669 --> 32:17.138
Jake up on statutory rape
charges if he ever even
looked at anne-marie again.

32:19.642 --> 32:23.344
Then jake got
9 speeding tickets
in 2 weeks.

32:23.412 --> 32:24.612
So then
what happened?

32:24.680 --> 32:26.781
Jake and anne-marie
stopped seeing each other.

32:26.849 --> 32:29.384
Were they ok
with that?

32:29.451 --> 32:30.819
Jake wasn't.

32:30.886 --> 32:32.253
I don't know
about anne-marie.

32:32.321 --> 32:34.689
And what about--
what about dylan?

32:34.757 --> 32:35.723
Were they friends?

32:35.791 --> 32:37.759
They were, but after
she and jake broke up,

32:37.827 --> 32:39.661
I didn't see her
around here anymore.

32:39.728 --> 32:42.330
Jake must've been
upset with the way
things ended.

32:42.398 --> 32:43.464
He was hurt.

32:43.532 --> 32:44.465
And being a teenager,

32:44.533 --> 32:46.000
He took it out
on his dad and me.

32:46.068 --> 32:47.769
And dylan?

32:48.971 --> 32:50.872
Him, too.

33:06.055 --> 33:07.388
Just tell me
what happened.

33:07.456 --> 33:08.857
No, there's no time.

33:08.924 --> 33:10.158
We have to get
rid of it right now.

33:10.226 --> 33:11.726
My dad never
goes up there.

33:11.794 --> 33:14.329
It's not your dad, ok?
it's that lady.
uh, melinda whatever.

33:14.396 --> 33:16.898
She was just at my house.
she's figuring it out.

33:18.701 --> 33:20.468
You have to hurry.
my dad's on
his way home.

33:25.140 --> 33:27.242
Dylan must've known
anne-marie when he was
living with jake.

33:27.309 --> 33:28.710
You think he started
crushing on her?

33:28.777 --> 33:30.311
Melinda, on phone:
or maybe she fell
for him, too.

33:30.379 --> 33:31.312
That's why
he's so angry

33:31.380 --> 33:32.647
About lovers
being apart.

33:32.715 --> 33:34.315
Jake must've been pissed
when he found out.

33:34.383 --> 33:36.417
yeah,
especially after
he'd taken dylan in.

33:36.485 --> 33:37.485
Hmm.

33:37.553 --> 33:39.387
A lovers' triangle
gone bad.

33:39.455 --> 33:41.022
Geometry can be so cruel.

33:41.090 --> 33:42.423
But that
still doesn't explain

33:42.491 --> 33:44.692
Why dylan blames ramsey
for what happened.

33:44.760 --> 33:47.028
Or why anne-marie
was keeping jake's secret.

33:47.096 --> 33:48.730
Yeah, she's the key
to all of this.

33:54.303 --> 33:55.370
it's my dad.

33:55.437 --> 33:56.905
You have to get
out of here.

34:00.409 --> 34:02.210
Hold on!

34:02.278 --> 34:03.311
What the hell
are you doing here?

34:03.379 --> 34:05.146
Dad, please.
don't.

34:05.214 --> 34:06.814
Didn't i tell you
to leave my daughter alone?

34:06.882 --> 34:07.916
Just back off.

34:07.983 --> 34:09.417
Daddy, no.

34:11.820 --> 34:13.121
Is that blood?

34:14.822 --> 34:16.757
What the hell did you do?

34:18.627 --> 34:19.960
Don't come any closer.

34:20.029 --> 34:22.230
Put that thing down.

34:22.297 --> 34:23.264
Tell me what you've done.

34:23.331 --> 34:24.599
I said back off!

34:24.667 --> 34:28.036
Daddy, no!

34:28.103 --> 34:29.270
Daddy, no.

34:31.572 --> 34:33.074
Stop, both of you!

35:01.008 --> 35:02.742
Hey, what the hell
is wrong with you?

35:02.809 --> 35:04.043
Get back here!

35:04.111 --> 35:06.612
Whoo, yeah!

35:18.759 --> 35:19.692
Put it down!

35:19.760 --> 35:20.693
stay away from me!

35:20.761 --> 35:22.762
Officer ramsey:
drop the bat, jake.

35:22.829 --> 35:23.796
Jake, please!

35:23.864 --> 35:24.930
Give me the bat, jake.

35:24.998 --> 35:26.298
You're in enough
trouble already.

35:26.366 --> 35:28.234
Stay away from me!
melinda: hey, jake.

35:28.301 --> 35:29.702
Ms. gordon, please!
jake,

35:29.770 --> 35:30.970
You don't have
to do this, ok?

35:31.038 --> 35:32.271
It was an accident.

35:32.339 --> 35:33.406
Give me that!

35:36.043 --> 35:37.209
Did you kill that boy?

35:37.277 --> 35:39.078
What the hell
did you kids do?

35:39.146 --> 35:40.746
It wasn't just us.

35:40.814 --> 35:42.081
If it was an accident,

35:42.149 --> 35:43.416
You've got to stop
lying about it.

35:43.483 --> 35:45.651
Whatever you did,
i'll help you.

35:45.719 --> 35:47.853
Anne-marie, you have
to tell your father
what happened.

35:51.792 --> 35:54.226
Somebody tell me
what's going on.

35:58.365 --> 35:59.498
You think you have
everyone's number,

35:59.566 --> 36:01.534
But you don't know
anything.

36:01.601 --> 36:04.904
Dylan was the one
who was smashing
your mailbox, daddy.

36:04.971 --> 36:06.539
It was dylan.
why?

36:06.606 --> 36:09.241
See? you have no clue
about that, either.

36:10.277 --> 36:11.777
Did you know
what dylan was doing?

36:11.845 --> 36:13.446
No. i had no idea.

36:13.513 --> 36:16.115
We only just
found out about it
the night he died.

36:18.852 --> 36:20.586
dylan and me,
we didn't really
hang out at school,

36:20.654 --> 36:21.987
Even when he was staying
with me, but...

36:23.590 --> 36:25.157
Dylan! come on, man, need
a ride? hop in. come on.

36:25.225 --> 36:27.626
That night, we were
all at a party together,

36:27.694 --> 36:29.528
So we gave him a ride.

36:29.596 --> 36:32.264
All right, let's go.

36:32.332 --> 36:34.567
i was complaining
about my dad.

36:34.634 --> 36:35.668
That's when
dylan told us

36:35.736 --> 36:36.902
It was him
and his friends

36:36.970 --> 36:39.071
Who were playing
mailbox baseball
at our house.

36:39.139 --> 36:41.440
Dude, really?
what the hell?

36:41.508 --> 36:43.509
Why?

36:43.577 --> 36:45.778
Why'd you do it?

36:45.846 --> 36:47.646
I never asked him to do it.

36:47.714 --> 36:49.482
No, but he
did it for you

36:49.549 --> 36:52.084
Because he knew
how ramsey was
harassing you.

36:52.152 --> 36:53.352
Yeah.

36:53.420 --> 36:54.987
He said,

36:55.055 --> 36:56.989
"i've got
your back, man."

36:57.057 --> 36:58.524
Ok, so, then
what happened?

36:58.592 --> 37:00.326
I wanted jake
to do it.

37:00.393 --> 37:02.228
Smash the mailbox.

37:02.295 --> 37:05.631
It would make my dad
so mad, and i wanted
to make him mad.

37:05.699 --> 37:08.200
And it was
just a mailbox.

37:08.268 --> 37:10.236
At first,
jake didn't want to.

37:10.303 --> 37:11.871
Get it, come on, baby,
get it! let's go!
let's do this, hit it!

37:11.938 --> 37:14.106
I had to drive around
the block 5 times.

37:15.709 --> 37:16.909
But eventually...

37:16.977 --> 37:18.577
Yeah!

37:24.050 --> 37:26.519
Oh, no!

37:28.321 --> 37:29.889
What did you do
to the mailbox?

37:29.956 --> 37:32.658
I needed
the vandalism to stop.

37:32.726 --> 37:33.859
That's all i wanted.

37:33.927 --> 37:35.561
It happened 5 times.
whoo, yeah!

37:35.629 --> 37:38.130
They'd come by,
smash the mailbox
and drive away.

37:39.299 --> 37:41.367
I was already
feeling like

37:41.434 --> 37:43.369
I couldn't
control anything.

37:43.436 --> 37:45.070
The things
i see at work,
you wouldn't believe.

37:47.340 --> 37:49.775
If i couldn't keep
a mailbox on a post,

37:49.843 --> 37:52.845
How was i supposed
to keep my family safe?

37:52.913 --> 37:54.914
When did you realize
what had happened?

37:54.981 --> 37:56.382
The next night.

37:56.449 --> 37:58.484
Jake drove me home.

37:58.552 --> 38:01.554
That's when i saw
the mailbox wasn't
even dented.

38:01.621 --> 38:05.090
Then i saw the concrete

38:05.158 --> 38:06.859
And i lost it.

38:06.927 --> 38:08.894
So that vandalism
was you?

38:08.962 --> 38:12.398
Not dylan? you caused
all that damage?

38:12.465 --> 38:13.566
It was me.

38:13.633 --> 38:15.267
I had no idea.

38:15.335 --> 38:18.037
And you were acting
so strangely.

38:18.104 --> 38:20.005
And then you
started asking
these questions,

38:20.073 --> 38:22.474
I thought
you did something.

38:22.542 --> 38:24.276
I did, dad.

38:24.344 --> 38:26.846
But it was
an accident.

38:26.913 --> 38:29.882
I never wanted
anybody to get hurt.

38:29.950 --> 38:32.585
I just wanted
to feel like i
could protect you.

38:32.652 --> 38:34.720
I never asked
for your protection,

38:34.788 --> 38:36.222
And i don't want it.

38:36.289 --> 38:38.390
Tell her she's wrong.

38:38.458 --> 38:39.491
And so was i.

38:39.559 --> 38:41.961
Wrong about what?

38:42.028 --> 38:43.662
He's nothing like
my father, is he?

38:43.730 --> 38:45.831
No.

38:45.899 --> 38:48.000
No, she means
everything to him.

38:48.068 --> 38:50.236
And he would never
do anything to hurt her.

38:50.303 --> 38:52.471
Dylan's here.

38:54.307 --> 38:55.608
He's with us now?

38:56.643 --> 38:58.777
Oh, my god. dylan.

39:00.046 --> 39:02.381
Is that why
you punished him?

39:02.449 --> 39:03.983
'cause you wanted
to punish your father?

39:06.953 --> 39:08.654
I made a mistake.

39:10.223 --> 39:11.657
The anger that he had
toward his father,

39:11.725 --> 39:13.926
He took it out on you.

39:13.994 --> 39:15.027
But he's sorry.

39:16.663 --> 39:18.297
I'm sorry, too.

39:18.365 --> 39:19.965
Will you tell
him that?

39:20.033 --> 39:21.300
He can hear you.

39:23.103 --> 39:24.770
Dylan, man.

39:27.073 --> 39:28.941
I can't believe it.
i feel horrible.

39:29.009 --> 39:30.009
I...

39:32.579 --> 39:34.813
I killed you.

39:35.882 --> 39:37.349
Don't say that.

39:37.417 --> 39:39.051
It's not like you meant
for it to happen.

39:39.119 --> 39:41.954
He doesn't blame you.

39:42.022 --> 39:43.055
It was an accident.

39:43.123 --> 39:46.358
All he was doing
was being my friend.

39:46.426 --> 39:47.626
I'll never
forget that.

39:47.694 --> 39:50.362
All that he cares about
is that you were
his friend.

39:50.430 --> 39:52.097
He's gonna
always remember that.

39:52.165 --> 39:54.400
Nothing else matters.

39:55.835 --> 39:57.202
How is dylan?

39:57.270 --> 39:59.505
Can he move on now?

40:02.142 --> 40:04.376
She was my friend, too,

40:04.444 --> 40:06.011
And i don't want her
to end up like me.

40:06.079 --> 40:08.547
He's worried.

40:08.615 --> 40:10.549
That the two of you
will end up like
he and his dad.

40:10.617 --> 40:14.053
No. god,
please no.

40:14.120 --> 40:17.656
Look, baby,

40:17.724 --> 40:20.092
I know i've made
a lot of mistakes.

40:21.094 --> 40:22.094
I know it's
not enough

40:22.162 --> 40:23.629
Just to say i was
protecting you.

40:23.697 --> 40:25.698
No, it's not.

40:25.765 --> 40:29.268
I guess...

40:29.336 --> 40:31.370
I guess i'm gonna
have to give you
some freedom,

40:31.438 --> 40:34.073
And trust you.

40:34.140 --> 40:35.674
It's just,
when i think
of you getting hurt.

40:36.843 --> 40:39.211
I don't want you
to get hurt either, daddy.

40:39.279 --> 40:40.713
But it happens.

40:40.780 --> 40:43.515
Bad stuff happens.
you can't stop it.

40:43.583 --> 40:47.619
No, you can't.

40:47.687 --> 40:50.823
But you can
be there for people
when they need you.

40:50.890 --> 40:51.957
Sometimes that's enough.

40:52.025 --> 40:53.592
Sometimes it has to be.

40:55.595 --> 40:59.031
So you just want me
to "be there"?

40:59.099 --> 41:00.566
And that's all?

41:02.302 --> 41:03.836
Sometimes a hug is good.

41:18.618 --> 41:20.652
Will you tell them
i said good-bye?

41:23.456 --> 41:25.457
I will, i promise.

41:40.340 --> 41:42.141
What happened?

41:42.208 --> 41:44.476
You helped him
find the light.

41:46.146 --> 41:48.013
He's gone.

41:48.081 --> 41:50.149
He said to tell you good-bye.

42:09.969 --> 42:11.503
Did you have
a hard day?

42:12.505 --> 42:14.440
it was ok.

42:14.507 --> 42:16.542
Long, but ok.

42:16.609 --> 42:19.044
Can i do anything
to help?

42:21.648 --> 42:23.515
Sometimes
a hug is good.

42:31.958 --> 42:34.560
Mommy, you can
let go now.

42:36.329 --> 42:38.964
I will, baby.

42:39.032 --> 42:41.733
One of these days,
i will.
