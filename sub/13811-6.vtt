{\an1}What's
the problem, Reg?

01:24.667 --> 01:27.670
The anniversary issue
of the <i> Zine</i> is coming up

01:27.754 --> 01:30.089
and I want it to be
something special.

01:30.173 --> 01:32.592

{\an1}REGGIE:
Wait a minute.

01:46.940 --> 01:49.067
That's a great idea, Otto.

01:49.150 --> 01:51.277
I can select
the top extreme athlete

01:51.361 --> 01:52.654
in all of Ocean Shores

01:52.737 --> 01:55.031
and I'll put him on the cover

athletes out there, Ottoman.

Maybe you'll make it,
maybe you won't.

I hate to disagree
with you, brother

{\an1}but asparagus
has no place on pizza.

02:12.549 --> 02:13.508

Okay, see,
Raymundo and I

on the best topping ever.

to do that, little cuz?

favorite pineapple in the field.

02:34.863 --> 02:37.073
Don't worry, Tito.

02:37.156 --> 02:38.992
I'm going to be totally fair
and objective.

Then maybe you
can tell Tito here

02:40.910 --> 02:42.620
fairly and objectively

02:42.704 --> 02:47.125
that peanut butter and sardine
is an excellent pizza topping.

Whoo! Yeah.

03:05.018 --> 03:06.769
Ha, ha, ha. Whoa.

03:06.853 --> 03:08.271
Yeah, Ottoman.

03:08.354 --> 03:09.522
Great. Whoo.

to be on the list

You won't try mine.

10:17.116 --> 10:17.992
You won't try mine.

10:18.075 --> 10:19.618
Hey, look.

10:19.702 --> 10:21.662
Maybe the reason there are
so many pizza toppings

10:21.746 --> 10:23.789
is 'cause people like
to pick their own.

10:23.873 --> 10:25.207
Right!

10:25.291 --> 10:28.294
So we can have people vote
for their favorite topping.

10:28.377 --> 10:30.254
Let the people decide!

10:30.338 --> 10:33.132
Yeah, let the people decide.

10:33.215 --> 10:35.509
Great idea!

10:36.385 --> 10:37.678
SAM:
This is exciting.

10:37.762 --> 10:40.973
Who do you think it's
going to be, Otto?

10:41.057 --> 10:43.142
{\an1}Whoever gave her
the best gift. Duh!

10:43.225 --> 10:45.853
{\an5}EDDIE:
You guys didn't give her
anything good.

10:45.936 --> 10:48.230
I gave her
a Dark Dominion video game.

10:48.314 --> 10:50.816
Thanks for coming,
everybody.

10:50.900 --> 10:52.610
As you know, this is
supposed to be the day

10:52.693 --> 10:55.196
that I announce
the <i> Zine's</i> choice

10:55.279 --> 10:57.239
for Ocean Shores'
most extreme athlete.

10:57.323 --> 10:58.908
But because of the way I acted

10:58.991 --> 11:02.536
people started thinking
that the only way to get picked

11:02.620 --> 11:04.497
was to do me favors
or give me stuff.

11:04.580 --> 11:06.791
So, I'm giving everything back

11:06.874 --> 11:10.836
and I won't be picking
the best athlete.

11:10.920 --> 11:11.253
What?

11:11.337 --> 11:13.172
{\an3}No way.

11:13.255 --> 11:14.757
What?

11:14.840 --> 11:17.426
Instead, I'm going to
let the readers decide.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.095
Everybody take one.

11:19.178 --> 11:20.596
One vote per person.

11:20.679 --> 11:21.138
Your vote counts.

11:21.222 --> 11:23.099
Way to go, Reg.

11:23.182 --> 11:24.475
You did the right thing.

11:24.558 --> 11:26.018
Thanks, Sammy.

11:26.102 --> 11:27.728
Do you think
I have a chance?

11:27.812 --> 11:30.106
You've got my
vote, Squid.

11:30.189 --> 11:31.440
Ah, that's my girl.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.317
I knew she could handle it.

11:33.401 --> 11:37.530
The question is, brother, how is
Ottoman going to handle it?

11:37.613 --> 11:38.697
Otto Rocket.
Vote for me.

11:38.781 --> 11:39.782
The name's Otto.
Love to have your vote.

11:39.865 --> 11:42.326
You might sn me
at Madtown.

11:42.410 --> 11:44.370
{\an5}OTTO:
Rocket Boy's my nickname.

11:44.453 --> 11:45.454
Yeah, Otto.

11:45.538 --> 11:47.123
Yeah, yeah, right.

11:47.206 --> 11:48.624
Ask all your friends.

11:48.707 --> 11:49.625
Don't forget--

11:49.708 --> 11:50.000
TITO:
boy, people's power...

12:42.094 --> 12:43.179
{\an8}There it is, gang:

12:43.262 --> 12:44.138
{\an7}The Catalina Classic
Paddleboard Race.

12:44.221 --> 12:45.306
{\an8}That's right,
little cousins

12:45.389 --> 12:46.098
{\an8}32 miles of glorious
open-sea paddling

12:46.182 --> 12:47.558
{\an8}using nothing but these.

12:47.641 --> 12:48.517
{\an8}It's just too bad
<i>they</i> have never
helped you beat me

12:48.601 --> 12:49.185
{\an8}my-good-but-slow-paddling
friend.

12:49.268 --> 12:50.144
{\an7}(<i> laughs</i> )

12:50.227 --> 12:50.978
{\an8}You are mistaken, brother.

12:51.061 --> 12:51.854
{\an8}<i>I</i> always beat <i> you.</i>

12:51.937 --> 12:53.063
What? You have never beat me.

12:53.147 --> 12:54.023
You know, we could help
you settle this argument

12:54.106 --> 12:54.774
if you ever let us
go along.

12:54.857 --> 12:55.483
Yeah, Dad, come on.

12:55.566 --> 12:56.692
We can handle it.

12:56.775 --> 12:57.568
{\an1}You think <i> you</i> could handle
the Catalina Classic?

12:57.651 --> 12:58.694
Totally, Raymundo.

12:58.777 --> 12:59.570
The point is, Raymundo,
you tell us every year

12:59.653 --> 13:00.571
we'll be ready next year.

13:00.654 --> 13:01.280
Well, this year, we <i> are</i> ready.

13:01.363 --> 13:01.697
Totally ready.

13:02.323 --> 13:03.157
Hmm... all right.

13:03.240 --> 13:04.033
You talked me into it.

13:04.116 --> 13:06.035
{\an4}Why not?

13:04.116 --> 13:06.035
Why not? We can...

13:06.118 --> 13:06.535
We can... (<i> gasps</i> )

13:06.619 --> 13:08.412
We can go?!

13:08.496 --> 13:10.164
You mean it, Raymundo?!

13:10.247 --> 13:13.209
I already cleared it with Paula
and Twister's folks.

13:13.292 --> 13:14.585
You can all go.

13:14.668 --> 13:16.337
But not on paddleboards.

13:16.420 --> 13:19.465
You guys can follow along
on your sea kayaks.

13:19.548 --> 13:20.716
{\an3}Awesome!

13:19.548 --> 13:20.716
{\an1}Radical!

13:20.799 --> 13:22.218
On one condition:

13:22.301 --> 13:25.221
you kids do
exactly what I tell you.

13:25.304 --> 13:26.889
Do I have your word?

13:26.972 --> 13:27.890
You got it!

13:27.973 --> 13:28.849
Of course!

13:28.933 --> 13:29.391
{\an4}You bet!

13:28.933 --> 13:29.391
{\an3}Sure thing!

13:29.475 --> 13:32.102
Then it's a deal.

13:32.186 --> 13:33.270
(<i> cheering</i> )

13:33.354 --> 13:35.481
{\an5}Catalina, here we come.

13:33.354 --> 13:35.481
Yay, finally.

13:35.564 --> 13:37.942
(<i> seagull screeching</i> )

13:39.818 --> 13:42.196
RAY:
Now remember, gang

13:42.279 --> 13:44.031
in the open ocean there are
currents

13:44.114 --> 13:45.449
the weather can change

13:45.533 --> 13:47.743
{\an1}and you certainly want to stay
clear of the shipping lanes.

13:47.826 --> 13:49.995
We got it, Raymundo.
No worries.

13:50.079 --> 13:53.749
{\an1}And most important, you're not,
under any circumstance

13:53.832 --> 13:56.293
{\an1}to leave the paddleboarders,
got it?

13:56.377 --> 13:59.922
I dub thee the <i> Shred-tanic.</i>
Yeah!

14:00.005 --> 14:03.592
Tito, why do I get the feeling

14:03.676 --> 14:05.177
no one ever listens to me?

14:05.261 --> 14:07.429
Tito?

14:07.513 --> 14:08.264
(<i> kissing sounds</i> )

14:08.347 --> 14:11.100
What? You say something,
brother?

14:11.183 --> 14:12.935

(<i> whistle blows</i> )

14:29.034 --> 14:31.704
See you at the
finish line, kids.

14:31.787 --> 14:36.542
Ha! That's if you make it
to the finish line, brother.

14:36.625 --> 14:38.210
Let's go, dudes!

14:38.294 --> 14:41.046
Last one to Ocean Shore is
a kwimbie.

14:47.303 --> 14:49.305
I don't see Ray and Tito.

14:49.388 --> 14:52.182
They're probably way up ahead
in first place.

14:52.266 --> 14:54.602
Or not.

14:54.685 --> 14:58.606
(<i> both grunting</i> )

15:00.357 --> 15:04.820
No offense, Otto, but Raymundo
and Tito are kind of slow.

15:04.903 --> 15:06.822
Tell me about it.

15:06.905 --> 15:08.949
What do you say we liven things
up till they get here.

15:09.033 --> 15:12.202
How about a race to that buoy
over there.

15:12.286 --> 15:13.203
(<i> dinging</i> )

15:13.287 --> 15:14.622
Maybe we sh-shouldn't.

15:14.705 --> 15:15.748
Remember what your dad said.

15:15.831 --> 15:18.959
{\an1}He said stay close
to the paddleboarders

15:19.043 --> 15:20.836
and, duh, most of them
are way up there.

15:20.919 --> 15:23.297
(<i> buoy dinging</i> )

15:23.380 --> 15:24.840
I don't know, Otto.

15:24.923 --> 15:27.426
Come on. What are you, afraid?

15:27.509 --> 15:30.387
{\an1}Yeah, I'm afraid of what losing
would do to you.

15:30.471 --> 15:32.640
Let's bust, Sammy.

15:38.312 --> 15:42.066
Tito, you must be paddling
too slow.

15:42.149 --> 15:44.610
The kids are getting
a little far ahead.

15:45.944 --> 15:47.196
(<i> panting</i> ):
Funny.

15:47.279 --> 15:50.783
I was worrying about you
falling too far behind.

15:50.866 --> 15:52.076
(<i> laughing</i> )

15:52.159 --> 15:55.371
The only thing you should be
worried about

15:55.454 --> 15:57.414
is finishing in last place.

15:57.498 --> 15:59.792
Oh, no.
That belongs to you, brother.

15:59.875 --> 16:01.293
{\an5}(<i> grunting</i> )

15:59.875 --> 16:01.293
Yeah?

Yeah, man.

16:08.342 --> 16:09.051
Way to go, Otto Man.

16:09.134 --> 16:12.888
Oh, pul-eeze. We may have lost

16:12.971 --> 16:15.516
but at least we're dry.

16:21.522 --> 16:23.190
(<i> shouting and laughing</i> )

16:23.273 --> 16:25.693
Watch out, Twist!

Get 'em! Splash 'em!

16:27.444 --> 16:29.613
{\an3}Yeah!

16:29.697 --> 16:32.574
Guys, we're getting pretty far
away from the paddleboarders.

16:32.658 --> 16:33.617
We should paddle back.

16:33.701 --> 16:35.994
Otherwise, Raymundo will
chew us out, royal.

16:36.078 --> 16:38.122
That is if we don't get
chewed up first.

16:39.581 --> 16:41.875
ALL:
Shark!

16:45.546 --> 16:47.172

16:59.184 --> 17:00.436
(<i> coughing</i> )

17:00.519 --> 17:03.772
{\an1}Whoa, we were
almost shark food.

17:03.856 --> 17:04.857
(<i> squeaking</i> )

17:04.940 --> 17:06.650
Don't you mean <i> dolphin</i> food.

17:06.733 --> 17:09.319
Pacific bottle-nosed dolphin
to be precise.

17:09.403 --> 17:12.030
(<i> laughter</i> )

17:18.369 --> 17:21.330
Whoa! Major backside air!

17:21.415 --> 17:22.374
(<i> squeaking</i> )

17:22.458 --> 17:24.667
{\an1}Ha, that must be
the Squid dolphin.

17:24.752 --> 17:28.172
(<i> laughing</i> )

17:46.523 --> 17:48.275
This is intensely not good.

17:48.358 --> 17:49.610
I cannot see the paddleboarders.

17:49.693 --> 17:52.321
We better head back.

17:52.404 --> 17:54.406
Guys, it's this way.

17:54.490 --> 17:56.992
Wrong, Reg, it's this way.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.786
I think Otto's right;
it's this way.

17:58.869 --> 18:01.330
You always think Otto's right.

18:01.413 --> 18:04.166
You'd go along with him
if he went off a cliff.

18:04.249 --> 18:05.667
No, I wouldn't.

18:05.751 --> 18:06.543
Oh, yeah.

18:06.627 --> 18:10.255
{\an1}Just like that time
on Mt. Shasta.

18:10.339 --> 18:12.341
You know, simply by using
the sun for navigation

18:12.424 --> 18:16.470
we should be able to find
which way it is to shore.

18:16.553 --> 18:19.014
Way to go, Squid!

18:20.390 --> 18:20.974
{\an1}Oh, no...

18:21.058 --> 18:23.477
This is completely bogus.

18:23.560 --> 18:24.770
We're caught in fog.

18:24.853 --> 18:26.688
A marine layer if you want to be
technical.

18:26.772 --> 18:28.690
Now what do we do?

18:28.774 --> 18:29.358
Hello?!

18:29.441 --> 18:31.985
Can anybody hear us?!

(<i> panting</i> )

18:39.159 --> 18:41.161
Tito, I'm worried.

18:41.245 --> 18:44.957
That your arms are
going to fall off?

18:45.040 --> 18:47.376
Not me. I-I feel great.

18:47.459 --> 18:50.879
(<i> gasping</i> ):
No, the kids, I can't see them.

18:50.963 --> 18:53.382
Oh, I hear you, brother.

18:53.465 --> 18:56.051
{\an1}Come on, let's dig in
and hope the little cousins

18:56.134 --> 18:57.177
are up ahead.

18:57.261 --> 19:00.180
Dude, we've been
floating like this

19:00.264 --> 19:01.139
like <i> forever.</i>

19:01.223 --> 19:03.976
{\an1}It's only been
a couple hours, dude.

19:04.059 --> 19:06.061
{\an1}We're going to be fine,
right, Reg?

19:06.144 --> 19:07.437
You got it, Otto.

19:07.521 --> 19:08.564
No worries.

19:08.647 --> 19:09.398
(<i> nervous laugh</i> )

19:09.481 --> 19:10.899
Excuse me!

19:10.983 --> 19:14.695
Does anyone else notice
that we're lost at sea?

19:14.778 --> 19:17.865
{\an5}Shh! Do you hear something?

19:14.778 --> 19:17.865
(<i> engine rumbling</i> )

19:17.948 --> 19:19.825
Yeah. What is it?

19:25.831 --> 19:26.206
(<i> all screaming</i> )

19:36.341 --> 19:39.428
(<i> screaming</i> )

19:41.930 --> 19:45.267
(<i> screaming</i> )

19:51.732 --> 19:53.775
(<i> both gasping</i> )

19:53.859 --> 19:54.610
Quick get in.

19:54.693 --> 19:57.654
Here, grab my hand.

19:59.072 --> 20:02.910
That was... not fun.

20:02.993 --> 20:05.120
{\an1}I thought you said
we were going to be fine.

20:05.203 --> 20:06.955
I didn't say that,
Reggie did

20:07.039 --> 20:09.291
just before Squid
sank the kayak.

20:09.374 --> 20:12.794
Hey, I didn't sink the kayak.

20:12.878 --> 20:13.879
Knock it off, you guys.

20:13.962 --> 20:16.882
The only way we're going to get
out of this

20:16.965 --> 20:18.967
is if we calm down
and work together.

20:19.051 --> 20:19.843
{\an1}Calm down?

20:19.927 --> 20:22.596
We're stuck on one kayak

20:22.679 --> 20:25.140
{\an1}in the middle
of the shipping lane!

20:25.223 --> 20:27.017
Shipping lane?
That's it!

20:27.100 --> 20:29.770
If we follow that
tanker's trail

20:29.853 --> 20:30.896
it should bring us to shore.

20:30.979 --> 20:33.273
Reg, you're
a genius.

20:33.357 --> 20:36.652
(<i> horn sounding</i> )

20:36.735 --> 20:39.071
(<i> all grunting</i> )

20:39.696 --> 20:41.990
Um, guys...

20:42.074 --> 20:44.326
what if that tanker was going
out to sea instead?

20:44.409 --> 20:47.871
Then we'd kind of be going
the wrong way.

20:47.955 --> 20:50.040
Oh!

20:50.123 --> 20:51.708
{\an1}(<i> mockingly</i> ):
"Wait to go, Reg.

20:51.792 --> 20:53.293
You're a genius."

20:53.377 --> 20:55.629
{\an5}I don't hear <i> you</i>
coming up with
any bright ideas

20:55.712 --> 20:57.798
Mr. Let's-race-to-the-buoy-
and-get-us-totally-lost!

20:57.881 --> 21:00.175
That's right!

21:00.259 --> 21:02.052
If it wasn't for you,
we would be in this mess!

21:02.135 --> 21:03.136
I didn't hear you
complaining

21:03.220 --> 21:06.139
when we went after
those dolphins.

21:06.223 --> 21:08.266
"Specific bottle-nosed
dolphins

21:08.350 --> 21:09.518
to be precise."

21:09.601 --> 21:10.936
You mean "Pa-cific."

21:11.019 --> 21:15.107
Stop fighting. It's bad enough
that Dad's going to agro

21:15.190 --> 21:16.858
when he finds us.

21:16.942 --> 21:17.901
<i>If</i> he finds us.

21:17.985 --> 21:21.029
If anybody ever finds us.

21:22.072 --> 21:24.741
Oh, no! Here we ago again!

21:24.825 --> 21:26.034
{\an1}Paddle!

21:26.118 --> 21:28.954
(<i> helicopter whirring</i> )

21:29.037 --> 21:31.289
(<i> all yelling</i> )

21:33.709 --> 21:35.919
(<i> screaming</i> )

21:37.963 --> 21:40.382
It's got me!

21:40.465 --> 21:42.592
(<i> screaming</i> )

21:44.594 --> 21:46.930
{\an1}Raymundo?!

21:52.894 --> 21:53.437
(<i> grunts</i> )

21:57.816 --> 22:00.068
The little cousins got
to work in The Shack

22:00.152 --> 22:00.819
for a <i> whole</i> month
huh, brother.

22:00.902 --> 22:03.155
That's right, Tito.

22:03.238 --> 22:04.156
{\an1}They didn't listen to me
like they said they would.

22:04.239 --> 22:06.700
{\an1}Besides, those
kayaks weren't cheap.

22:06.783 --> 22:09.661
Right, gang?

22:09.745 --> 22:12.122
(<i> all agreeing</i> )

22:12.205 --> 22:14.124
Look at the bright
side, brother

22:14.207 --> 22:16.960
{\an1}they did save you from
another humiliating defeat.

22:17.044 --> 22:17.711
(<i> kissing sounds</i> )

22:17.794 --> 22:19.629
{\an1}Defeat?

22:19.713 --> 22:20.964
I was the one in the lead

22:21.048 --> 22:23.133
when we flagged down
the lifeguard boat.

22:23.216 --> 22:24.259
I must still have
saltwater in my ears.

22:24.342 --> 22:26.970
Did you say <i> you</i> were
in the lead?

22:27.054 --> 22:28.972
{\an1}The paddleboards are
right here, muscle-bound.

22:29.056 --> 22:31.475
Anytime, anyplace.

22:31.558 --> 22:33.602
First one around
the pier and back.

22:33.685 --> 22:35.896
You're on!

22:35.979 --> 22:37.189
{\an3}Go Tito!

22:37.272 --> 22:38.690
All right!

22:38.774 --> 22:39.983
{\an1}Go Tito!

22:40.067 --> 22:41.610
Wait a minute!

22:41.693 --> 22:44.780
Uh, we're going to watch
from shore, right?

22:44.863 --> 22:45.781
{\an1}Of course.

22:45.864 --> 22:47.949
Solid ground.

22:48.033 --> 22:49.451
You better believe it.

22:49.534 --> 22:50.702
(<i> relived sigh</i> )

22:50.786 --> 22:51.953
Cool.

22:52.037 --> 22:54.414
(<i> kids cheering</i> )
