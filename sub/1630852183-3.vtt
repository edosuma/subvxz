WEBVTT

00:13.180 --> 00:15.141
[Camille] Across all cultures,

00:15.141 --> 00:18.811
mating is very often
a dance of deception.

00:18.811 --> 00:22.064
In the name of sex, love,
and everything in between,

00:22.064 --> 00:24.024
perceptions are played with

00:24.024 --> 00:28.904
in order to enhance
or hide certain realities.

00:36.120 --> 00:38.831
Camille, I'm engaged.

00:41.959 --> 00:44.962
and I hate it...

00:44.962 --> 00:47.256
- Pretty girl at the party.
- Mira.

00:47.256 --> 00:48.966
That's her name, but yeah.

00:48.966 --> 00:51.802
I just...I was waiting
for the right time to tell you.

00:51.802 --> 00:53.012
Before you kissed me
would have been great.

00:53.012 --> 00:54.430
Well, I mean, you kissed me.

00:54.430 --> 00:55.806
Really?

00:55.806 --> 00:58.017
You're looking
for a technicality?

00:58.017 --> 00:59.393
Okay, fine. Yeah.

00:59.393 --> 01:01.437
I leaned in first,
but you didn't pull away.

01:01.437 --> 01:03.689
And only one of us
knew about the engagement.

01:03.689 --> 01:05.274
- Yes, it was a mistake.
- You think?

01:05.274 --> 01:07.985
Look, Camille,
I feel bad about this.

01:07.985 --> 01:09.862
I feel...

01:11.947 --> 01:13.491
...like an idiot.

01:13.491 --> 01:14.909
Come on, Camille.

01:14.909 --> 01:16.410
No, please don't.

01:16.410 --> 01:20.414
outside baby, yeah...

01:20.414 --> 01:22.166
Goodbye, Ian.

01:41.477 --> 01:43.562
- Told y'all.
[both] Damn.

01:43.562 --> 01:46.273
Guys, I'm fine!
I'm seriously fine.

01:46.273 --> 01:47.691
Girl, you know
we don't believe you, right?

01:47.691 --> 01:49.819
You have rainbow sprinkles
in your hair.

01:49.819 --> 01:52.154
Guys, this is
completely normal.

01:52.154 --> 01:55.032
In all ancient cultures,
they would feast after death.

01:55.032 --> 01:56.992
And I think getting this close
to a promotion

01:56.992 --> 01:58.994
when Robin is fired
is exactly the kind of grief

01:58.994 --> 02:00.496
that deserves a sundae in bed.

02:00.496 --> 02:01.997
- Mm-mm.
- Okay.

02:01.997 --> 02:05.000
Girl, all this
ain't just about work.

02:05.000 --> 02:09.255
And you are giving me
serious 2016 déjà vu.

02:09.255 --> 02:11.423
And we're not gonna let you
disappear for weeks over Ian

02:11.423 --> 02:12.675
like you did the last time.

02:12.675 --> 02:15.719
Nope! Out of bed.
We're going out.

02:15.719 --> 02:18.389
You guys don't understand.
I was this close to full-time.

02:18.389 --> 02:20.015
Which means benefits
and a nice raise.

02:20.015 --> 02:21.725
And I was finally on track
for tenure.

02:21.725 --> 02:25.980
And yes, fine, Ian being
engaged was a surprise too.

02:25.980 --> 02:29.525
When you saw her at the party,
did she look pregnant?

02:29.525 --> 02:31.902
- No, Angie. What the fuck?
- Why would you ask that?

02:31.902 --> 02:33.279
Why else do people get married?

02:33.279 --> 02:34.780
Because they love each other?

02:34.780 --> 02:36.448
Ooh. Okay, that's worse.

02:36.448 --> 02:39.326
You know, I prefer my ex
marry some ho he knocked up

02:39.326 --> 02:41.704
rather than know
he for real fell in love

02:41.704 --> 02:43.581
with someone who isn't me.

02:43.581 --> 02:44.832
- She's not helping.
- I know.

02:44.832 --> 02:46.375
Never.

02:46.375 --> 02:48.669
I ended things with Ian so that
I could focus on my career,

02:48.669 --> 02:50.170
and that just blew up.

02:50.170 --> 02:52.006
[sighs] Do you guys think
if I went with him to Paris,

02:52.006 --> 02:53.173
that'd be me instead?

02:53.173 --> 02:55.050
Oh, honey,
you cannot think that.

02:55.050 --> 02:56.760
Yes. You chose you.

02:56.760 --> 03:00.139
Men do that shit all the time
with no regrets.

03:00.139 --> 03:01.807
But what if I do have regrets?

03:01.807 --> 03:02.850
When we kissed...

03:02.850 --> 03:03.976
- [Quinn gasps]
- [Tye] What?

03:03.976 --> 03:07.062
Hold up. He's engaged
and he kissed you?

03:07.062 --> 03:09.607
I know. I know.
But it was like what you said.

03:09.607 --> 03:10.858
It felt like...

03:10.858 --> 03:12.735
like the universe
wants us together.

03:12.735 --> 03:14.153
So win him back.

03:14.153 --> 03:16.488
Call ICE on that British bitch.

03:16.488 --> 03:17.823
No, it's not even about her.

03:17.823 --> 03:19.575
It's just, I had a plan

03:19.575 --> 03:21.994
and none of this
is a part of it.

03:21.994 --> 03:23.495
Fuck.

03:23.495 --> 03:25.247
[sighs] Just fuck!

03:27.124 --> 03:30.044
[Quinn] Oh, no. Baby. Come on.
[Angie] No!

03:30.044 --> 03:31.420
[Tye] What do you
want to do, Camille?

03:31.420 --> 03:32.963
We don't have to go out.

03:32.963 --> 03:35.090
I...I have my Forbes interview
tomorrow anyway, so...

03:35.090 --> 03:37.718
Oh, she went five minutes
without saying Forbes.

03:37.718 --> 03:39.136
Excuse me for being proud.

03:39.136 --> 03:41.597
I think fresh air
will help, won't it?

03:41.597 --> 03:42.765
[Angie] Yeah, Camille.

03:42.765 --> 03:44.433
I cleared my schedule...

03:44.433 --> 03:45.476
Of what?

03:45.476 --> 03:47.227
Ain't no magazine
interviewing you.

03:47.227 --> 03:48.646
Okay, unnecessary shade.

03:48.646 --> 03:50.689
- No, because you started it.
- No, you started it.

03:50.689 --> 03:53.692
Okay, we all started it,
and now we're going to end it.

03:53.692 --> 03:55.444
[all] No!

03:55.444 --> 03:57.154
& TT The "Go Bananas"]

03:57.154 --> 03:58.113
[Quinn] See, Camille?

03:58.113 --> 04:00.491
Doesn't it feel better
to be out?

04:00.491 --> 04:01.492
Sure.

04:01.492 --> 04:02.868
The ride is nice.

04:02.868 --> 04:04.620
Thanks for getting
the Uber, Ang.

04:04.620 --> 04:06.747
Uber Black, bitch.
And you're welcome.

04:06.747 --> 04:07.998
Wait, how can you afford that?

04:07.998 --> 04:09.249
Did you get back on my account?

04:09.249 --> 04:10.918
Quit putting my business
in these streets.

04:10.918 --> 04:12.920
- I thought you got a new job.
- Fuck no.

04:12.920 --> 04:15.005
I can't take that wack part
in that wack show.

04:15.005 --> 04:16.215
I'm aiming higher.

04:16.215 --> 04:18.968
In show business,
perception is reality.

04:18.968 --> 04:22.054
If I say yes to being
in the background of Get Out,

04:22.054 --> 04:23.764
then I remain
in the background.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.891
Yes, but where are you now,
except in my Uber?

04:25.891 --> 04:27.142
Uber Black.

04:31.438 --> 04:32.815
[sighs]

04:32.815 --> 04:35.818
Oh, my God, Daniel just texted
that he misses me.

04:35.818 --> 04:37.987
Oh, shit.
I'm sorry, Camille.

04:37.987 --> 04:39.655
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't...don't do that.

04:39.655 --> 04:40.739
You deserve love.

04:40.739 --> 04:42.032
If this is gonna be fun,

04:42.032 --> 04:43.492
you can't keep
checking in with me.

04:43.492 --> 04:45.494
Do we know who Daniel is?

04:45.494 --> 04:47.746
He's the guy that I met
on this Prestige app.

04:47.746 --> 04:50.416
I still don't see how she got
accepted and I got kicked off.

04:50.416 --> 04:51.709
[Tye] Kicked off?
- Why?

04:51.709 --> 04:54.044
They said my profile pic
was too "vulgar."

04:54.044 --> 04:55.879
Honey, it is called Prestige.

04:55.879 --> 04:58.090
What's more prestigious
than my tits?

04:58.090 --> 05:00.592
Look, look, look, look.
Look how cute he is.

05:00.592 --> 05:02.428
Ooh, girl, he is so fine.

05:02.428 --> 05:04.555
He has an MBA from Wharton.

05:04.555 --> 05:06.807
We text all day.

05:06.807 --> 05:08.517
Mm-hmm, y'all
been texting forever.

05:08.517 --> 05:10.144
Why haven't you seen him
in person yet?

05:10.144 --> 05:12.688
Because he says that
anticipation is old-fashioned.

05:12.688 --> 05:13.897
Convenient.

05:13.897 --> 05:15.274
Okay, can we just
fast-forward to the part

05:15.274 --> 05:17.234
where we find out
you got catfished?

05:17.234 --> 05:19.194
I'm sorry.
That sounded bitter.

05:19.194 --> 05:20.821
We were all thinking it,
though.

05:20.821 --> 05:21.864
[gasps]

05:21.864 --> 05:23.032
[dramatic music playing]

05:23.032 --> 05:24.658
- [applause]
- [weakly] Yay.

05:24.658 --> 05:27.202
Let's go, ladies!

05:28.871 --> 05:32.124
Ladies,
this isn't black magic.

05:32.124 --> 05:34.043
This is Black Girl Magic!

05:34.043 --> 05:35.419
[laughs evilly]

05:35.419 --> 05:36.879
Quinn, what is this?

05:36.879 --> 05:38.756
It was 10% off at Groupon.

05:38.756 --> 05:40.799
Black girl magic.

05:40.799 --> 05:42.634
Black girl magic.

05:42.634 --> 05:45.054
Black girl magic.

05:45.054 --> 05:46.638
Let's light this up!

05:48.098 --> 05:49.433
- Oh.
- Oh!

05:49.433 --> 05:51.769
"Shake What Ya Momma Gave Ya"]

06:00.778 --> 06:03.072
doo-doo brown...

06:03.072 --> 06:05.741
And now the human chandelier.

06:09.328 --> 06:10.579
The fuck?

06:12.956 --> 06:14.666
Black girl ma...[screams]

06:14.666 --> 06:17.711
[all scream]

06:17.711 --> 06:20.422
I can't decide if that show
made me feel better or worse.

06:20.422 --> 06:22.132
I already forgot what we saw.

06:22.132 --> 06:25.052
Aw, you guys, Daniel
just texted me good night.

06:25.052 --> 06:26.762
Mm, dick pic.

06:26.762 --> 06:28.138
Ew. No.

06:28.138 --> 06:30.474
- No, I just got a dick pic.
- Oh.

06:30.474 --> 06:32.184
And look at this brother's
ashy knees.

06:32.184 --> 06:34.603
If you got one
hanging this long,

06:34.603 --> 06:35.938
moisturize
your motherfucking knees

06:35.938 --> 06:38.107
or, you know,
crop the shit out.

06:38.107 --> 06:40.567
Okay, that's my cue
to leave.

06:40.567 --> 06:42.611
Oh, but the food
hasn't even come yet.

06:42.611 --> 06:44.905
I know, but I need
to get a good night's sleep

06:44.905 --> 06:47.366
- before my...
[all] Forbes interview.

06:47.366 --> 06:48.742
[laughter]

06:48.742 --> 06:50.285
Well, call us after.

06:50.285 --> 06:52.412
- I shall.
- Break legs, bitch.

06:52.412 --> 06:53.664
[Quinn] Proud of you.
- Mwah!

06:53.664 --> 06:55.249
Our girl's gon' be in Forbes.

06:55.249 --> 06:57.292
I'ma be in Forbes.
I'ma be in Forbes.

06:57.292 --> 06:59.044
[all cheer]

06:59.044 --> 07:01.130
[laughter]

07:01.130 --> 07:03.215
See, here I am sad about an ex.

07:03.215 --> 07:04.466
What happened to me?

07:04.466 --> 07:06.552
I did better when
I wasn't thinking about men.

07:06.552 --> 07:08.428
Preach. Fuck Ian.

07:08.428 --> 07:09.721
Keep doing you.

07:09.721 --> 07:11.557
You're right. [scoffs]

07:11.557 --> 07:12.599
Ian who?

07:12.599 --> 07:14.977
I'm about work.
I'm about career.

07:14.977 --> 07:16.562
And tomorrow,
I'm gonna introduce myself

07:16.562 --> 07:17.688
to the new department head

07:17.688 --> 07:19.148
and make her
fall in love with me.

07:19.148 --> 07:20.649
- Yes.
[Angie] Yes!

07:20.649 --> 07:21.733
That's my baby!

07:21.733 --> 07:22.818
See?

07:22.818 --> 07:24.111
I've been healed
by Black girl magic.

07:24.111 --> 07:26.321
- Yay!
- Oh, gosh.

07:26.321 --> 07:27.698
[laughter]

07:27.698 --> 07:30.701
[upbeat music]

07:32.286 --> 07:34.246
Oh, my God.

07:34.246 --> 07:35.622
Dr. Pruitt?

07:35.622 --> 07:36.540
From Yale?

07:36.540 --> 07:37.958
You're the new department head?

07:37.958 --> 07:39.751
I'm such a fan of your work.

07:39.751 --> 07:41.879
I've read all three of your
books at least a dozen times.

07:41.879 --> 07:44.756
I quoted your research heavily
in my dissertation.

07:44.756 --> 07:45.924
Wow!

07:45.924 --> 07:47.092
Um, I'm one
of the adjunct professors,

07:47.092 --> 07:48.552
Camille Parks.

07:48.552 --> 07:50.637
I'm teaching Anthropology
of Sex and Love this semester.

07:52.723 --> 07:54.141
Can I call you back?

07:54.141 --> 07:55.225
[caller] Yeah, that's fine,
Dr. Pruitt.

07:55.225 --> 07:56.435
I'll talk to you later.

07:56.435 --> 07:57.477
- Sorry.
[Dr. Pruitt] Thanks.

07:57.477 --> 07:58.353
Sorry I just
kind of bust in here.

07:58.353 --> 07:59.813
I was excited.

07:59.813 --> 08:02.774
Yes, you did, Camille Parks.

08:02.774 --> 08:04.526
I've heard a lot about you.

08:04.526 --> 08:07.446
It's nice to put a face
to the reputation.

08:09.198 --> 08:10.449
Uh, reputation?

08:10.449 --> 08:13.785
Do you mean, like, good or...

08:13.785 --> 08:14.912
not bad?

08:14.912 --> 08:17.456
Did you come in here
for a reason?

08:17.456 --> 08:20.834
Yes, um, to, uh, say hello.

08:20.834 --> 08:22.044
Hello. [chuckles]

08:22.044 --> 08:23.378
Hello.

08:24.922 --> 08:26.965
Take care.

08:26.965 --> 08:28.634
Right.

08:28.634 --> 08:31.386
Yes, um, you...you take care.

08:31.386 --> 08:34.681
Um, and if you need anything,
I'm here. I'm your girl.

08:34.681 --> 08:37.017
- Are you free this afternoon?
- Yes.

08:37.017 --> 08:39.603
Yes, I am definitely free
this afternoon.

08:39.603 --> 08:41.521
And even if I wasn't,
I would change my schedule

08:41.521 --> 08:43.023
because I've given up dating
and I really want

08:43.023 --> 08:44.441
to hone in on my career goals.

08:44.441 --> 08:46.026
Um, I really want
to make it about...

08:46.026 --> 08:47.527
- Camille.
- Yes?

08:47.527 --> 08:50.906
- I'm a big fan of boundaries.
- Okay.

08:50.906 --> 08:53.992
So I need you
to just press pause

08:53.992 --> 08:57.079
and come by my house for tea.

08:57.079 --> 08:58.455
- And we'll talk then.
[Camille] Okay.

08:58.455 --> 09:00.082
That sounds like fun.

09:00.082 --> 09:01.500
Great.

09:01.500 --> 09:04.211
Uh, well, I'm gonna go.

09:04.211 --> 09:06.463
Um, I will see you later.

09:06.463 --> 09:08.966
Um, yeah, okay.
Well, I will see you later.

09:08.966 --> 09:10.550
- See you later.
[Camille] Okay.

09:18.558 --> 09:19.810
- Quinn?
- Yes.

09:19.810 --> 09:21.144
That is the name
on the account,

09:21.144 --> 09:22.854
so that is me, Quinn.

09:22.854 --> 09:24.690
Your chariot awaits.

09:24.690 --> 09:26.275
Let's get you to the ball.

09:28.235 --> 09:31.780
Or, uh, Duane Reade in Tribeca.

09:33.657 --> 09:37.536
So we're gonna pass, like,
50 Duane Reades on the way.

09:37.536 --> 09:39.204
I don't like those ones.

09:39.204 --> 09:41.915
The one by me
never has blue Gatorade.

09:41.915 --> 09:44.001
The one on Lennox's lights
don't work in the back,

09:44.001 --> 09:45.502
and that's just rape-y.

09:45.502 --> 09:49.589
Oh, and someone said something
bad about Obama in that one.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.967
The one on, uh,
129th and ACP...

09:51.967 --> 09:53.468
[both]
Smells like mop water.

09:53.468 --> 09:55.679
[laughter]

09:55.679 --> 09:57.514
Girl, you something else.

09:57.514 --> 09:59.933
Oh, you don't know the half.

10:01.268 --> 10:03.603
Anna Sharpe
from Forbes is here.

10:03.603 --> 10:04.855
Send her in.

10:07.607 --> 10:10.485
You are the boss, bitch.

10:10.485 --> 10:11.695
You got this.

10:14.823 --> 10:16.491
[both] Oh.

10:16.491 --> 10:18.035
[both moaning]

10:19.995 --> 10:24.791
[both chuckle awkwardly]

10:24.791 --> 10:26.710
Please, take a seat.

10:30.464 --> 10:32.132
Don't worry.
This isn't awkward at all.

10:32.132 --> 10:33.508
Did you know who I was when...

10:33.508 --> 10:35.010
Of course not.

10:35.010 --> 10:37.137
I'm freelance, last-minute
filling in for the usual guy.

10:37.137 --> 10:38.138
Oh, okay.

10:38.138 --> 10:40.140
Well, we fucked.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.308
- [awkward laughter]
- No biggie.

10:41.308 --> 10:42.726
Let's just
keep it professional.

10:42.726 --> 10:43.935
Of course.

10:43.935 --> 10:45.270
So...

10:45.270 --> 10:47.606
what was the drive
behind creating your app, Q?

10:47.606 --> 10:49.316
I saw a hole, and I filled it.

10:49.316 --> 10:50.567
It's pretty hard to believe

10:50.567 --> 10:52.152
that before Q,
there hasn't been a dating app

10:52.152 --> 10:54.654
specifically dedicated
to the queer POC population.

10:54.654 --> 10:56.031
But there is a demand?

10:56.031 --> 10:58.784
The over $5 million invested
should answer that question.

10:58.784 --> 11:00.619
We're using Camrose,

11:00.619 --> 11:02.954
the most advanced
programming language out there.

11:02.954 --> 11:05.957
We took the most accurate
personality tests--

11:05.957 --> 11:09.211
Myers-Briggs, Love Language,
Fisher Temperament--

11:09.211 --> 11:12.881
all to guarantee
the most precise matches.

11:12.881 --> 11:15.592
Yes, the app's tagline
is "Love guaranteed."

11:15.592 --> 11:17.135
That's a bit misleading,
isn't it?

11:17.135 --> 11:18.804
- How so?
[Anna] For one,

11:18.804 --> 11:20.847
it's hard to guarantee
someone finds love.

11:20.847 --> 11:23.642
Even harder when you eliminate
an entire demographic of people

11:23.642 --> 11:25.227
from your app.
How do you justify that?

11:25.227 --> 11:28.355
I justify it because QPOC
are the most vulnerable

11:28.355 --> 11:29.564
and overlooked markets.

11:29.564 --> 11:31.942
And they need to feel safe
when dating.

11:31.942 --> 11:34.111
Have you ever had
a relationship with a non-POC?

11:34.111 --> 11:36.071
In the past.

11:36.071 --> 11:37.739
Would you say you're against
interracial dating?

11:37.739 --> 11:39.408
No, not at all.
People can do what they want.

11:39.408 --> 11:41.076
But you yourself
are uninterested

11:41.076 --> 11:42.661
in dating a non-POC?

11:43.703 --> 11:45.122
I'll rephrase.

11:45.122 --> 11:48.125
Let's say you and I met
at a bar, had a great time,

11:48.125 --> 11:50.127
and I asked you out on a date.

11:50.127 --> 11:51.169
What would you say?

11:51.169 --> 11:53.380
I am currently not interested

11:53.380 --> 11:56.591
in pursuing relationships
with non-POC folks.

11:56.591 --> 11:58.260
But given your history,
you are interested

11:58.260 --> 12:00.887
in having sex with non-POC.

12:00.887 --> 12:02.597
It's a bit hypocritical,
don't you think?

12:02.597 --> 12:04.015
Excuse me?

12:04.015 --> 12:06.226
If I were to say
I were only interested

12:06.226 --> 12:07.936
in having sex
with people of color

12:07.936 --> 12:09.980
but uninterested
in anything romantic,

12:09.980 --> 12:12.190
one might call that
a fetishization.

12:12.190 --> 12:13.608
Wouldn't you?

12:13.608 --> 12:17.112
I'm sorry.
What was the question again?

12:17.112 --> 12:19.448
[Angie] I have to go get
fake smart girl glasses

12:19.448 --> 12:20.615
for an audition.

12:20.615 --> 12:23.201
- Ah, you're an actor?
- I'm a legend.

12:23.201 --> 12:25.454
Sometimes I sing,
and sometimes I act.

12:25.454 --> 12:26.580
[laughs]

12:26.580 --> 12:28.665
So we both paint pictures
with words.

12:28.665 --> 12:30.000
I'm a...a poet.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.336
I thought poets were old.

12:33.336 --> 12:35.797
More Love Jones,
less Langston Hughes.

12:35.797 --> 12:37.466
Hmm.

12:37.466 --> 12:39.176
An ad agency wanted
to hire me, but...

12:39.176 --> 12:40.719
I don't use my art
for capitalism.

12:40.719 --> 12:44.264
Capitalism is bullshit.
That's why I don't do jobs.

12:44.264 --> 12:46.141
Yeah, gotta stay true
to the art.

12:46.141 --> 12:47.642
Yes! You get it.

12:47.642 --> 12:49.603
So I was offered
this shitty role

12:49.603 --> 12:51.062
in Get the Musical.

12:51.062 --> 12:52.606
So I had to turn it down.

12:52.606 --> 12:54.483
It just wasn't inspired.

12:54.483 --> 12:57.861
A true artist will never
compromise her soul.

12:57.861 --> 13:00.405
Mm. That's deep.

13:01.948 --> 13:03.241
Hey, hey, you know what?

13:03.241 --> 13:05.744
Um, I'ma head back uptown
after I drop you off.

13:05.744 --> 13:07.329
- Mm-hmm.
- [Emmanuel] If you want,

13:07.329 --> 13:09.664
I can keep this carriage
waiting for you.

13:09.664 --> 13:10.790
My treat.

13:10.790 --> 13:13.460
Oh, I would like that
very much.

13:13.460 --> 13:17.964
[hip-hop music]

13:17.964 --> 13:19.382
Verdict?

13:19.382 --> 13:21.760
[Quinn gasps] Oh, my God.
Girl, you look good.

13:21.760 --> 13:25.388
Okay, like Black Chyna
going to court good.

13:25.388 --> 13:27.307
I'm gonna change.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.893
But you know what?
Honestly, I feel good.

13:29.893 --> 13:32.187
The new anthropology head?
A sista.

13:32.187 --> 13:33.939
No. Oh, my God,
that's amazing.

13:33.939 --> 13:35.482
Yes, girl.
She is Black.

13:35.482 --> 13:37.692
And she's already
invited me over for tea.

13:37.692 --> 13:38.944
[Tye] That's what's up!

13:38.944 --> 13:41.154
You see, we need
to pull each other up.

13:41.154 --> 13:43.782
That's what all these dudes
are doing in tech.

13:43.782 --> 13:46.284
Yesterday,
I was so down, you know?

13:46.284 --> 13:47.410
I mean, you saw me.

13:47.410 --> 13:49.246
- Oh, we did.
- Tragic.

13:49.246 --> 13:50.455
I thought that
losing Robin meant

13:50.455 --> 13:52.165
that I had to start
all over again,

13:52.165 --> 13:54.918
but having Dr. Pruitt
as a mentor

13:54.918 --> 13:56.294
is, like, a game-changer.

13:56.294 --> 13:57.712
I mean, having her cosign

13:57.712 --> 14:00.131
is pretty much
being guaranteed tenure.

14:00.131 --> 14:02.425
You see?
Girl, I don't know.

14:02.425 --> 14:04.678
Maybe Ian coming back in town
might have been good luck.

14:04.678 --> 14:06.429
[Camille scoffs] I'm not even
thinking about him.

14:06.429 --> 14:07.847
I'm all about work now.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.432
[Tye] Ha! Sure, you are.

14:09.432 --> 14:10.684
Okay, I think
that this one

14:10.684 --> 14:14.312
is perfect
for tea with the doctor.

14:14.312 --> 14:17.107
Y'all don't think mine
is too swaggy for Forbes?

14:17.107 --> 14:18.984
[Quinn] Honey, no!
- No.

14:18.984 --> 14:21.403
Stop playing.
Please look at yourself.

14:21.403 --> 14:23.655
Okay?
Look, this is a photo shoot.

14:23.655 --> 14:26.408
You're supposed to be the
swaggier version of yourself.

14:26.408 --> 14:28.577
I mean, look, this jacket
is making a statement.

14:28.577 --> 14:30.537
- Mm-hmm.
- Is it a statement?

14:30.537 --> 14:32.998
Or is it more
of a confused question?

14:32.998 --> 14:35.125
I want to look professional.

14:35.125 --> 14:37.127
Since when did you
care so much about that?

14:37.127 --> 14:38.545
Since Forbes!

14:38.545 --> 14:40.422
And since
I fucked the interviewer.

14:40.422 --> 14:41.756
You fucked on the record?

14:41.756 --> 14:42.799
Before.

14:42.799 --> 14:44.175
Y'all remember
that thirsty chick

14:44.175 --> 14:46.219
from the club who ate my food?

14:46.219 --> 14:47.846
- [gasps] Wait!
- No!

14:47.846 --> 14:49.389
That girl writes for Forbes?

14:49.389 --> 14:51.808
Who would have
expected that shit?

14:51.808 --> 14:53.727
I mean, she was cool at first,

14:53.727 --> 14:57.063
and then she started asking me
all kinds of shady questions.

14:57.063 --> 14:58.857
Is this gonna go bad?

14:58.857 --> 15:00.734
I don't need any bad press,
not right now.

15:00.734 --> 15:02.152
- No.
- No, no, no. It's okay.

15:02.152 --> 15:04.321
It's okay. You know what?
You just reach back out to her.

15:04.321 --> 15:06.865
You know, me and Dr. Pruitt
got off on a really weird foot,

15:06.865 --> 15:08.450
but then I fixed it.

15:08.450 --> 15:10.368
And then
she invited me over for tea.

15:10.368 --> 15:12.912
Okay, so like an interview
part two.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.664
- Yes!
- The remix.

15:14.664 --> 15:16.666
- Yes!
- [cell phone ringing]

15:16.666 --> 15:18.543
Oh, my God!

15:18.543 --> 15:19.628
It's Daniel.

15:19.628 --> 15:20.920
- Remind me...Daniel?
- Who?

15:20.920 --> 15:23.381
Daniel. Wharton.
Entrepreneur.

15:23.381 --> 15:26.635
We talked about him last night.
The guy from Prestige.

15:26.635 --> 15:29.512
[both]
Oh, that catfish nigga.

15:29.512 --> 15:30.930
Okay, I've never seen him
before in real life,

15:30.930 --> 15:32.307
so I mean, how do I look?

15:32.307 --> 15:34.559
- You look ama...
- Hey, Daniel!

15:34.559 --> 15:36.770
Wow, you are
even more beautiful

15:36.770 --> 15:38.271
- than your pictures.
- Thank you.

15:38.271 --> 15:40.899
And you are
the same man in yours.

15:40.899 --> 15:42.192
What? Did you think

15:42.192 --> 15:43.693
I was catfishing you
or something?

15:43.693 --> 15:45.236
- No.
- [both] Yup.

15:45.236 --> 15:46.738
[Daniel] Well, I think
it's time for a face-to-face.

15:46.738 --> 15:48.823
- Are you free...
- Yes!

15:48.823 --> 15:51.409
- I mean, when?
[Daniel] Tonight,00 p.m.

15:51.409 --> 15:54.537
- Uh, do you like...
- Yes. I mean...

15:54.537 --> 15:56.790
- I mean, what?
[Daniel] Lobster?

15:56.790 --> 15:59.668
Yes. I love lobster!

15:59.668 --> 16:01.795
Great. I will see you tonight
at00.

16:01.795 --> 16:03.046
[Daniel] Cool.
Cool. Cool. Cool.

16:03.046 --> 16:05.006
- I'll text you the address.
- Okay.

16:05.006 --> 16:06.424
[Daniel] Okay.
- Okay.

16:06.424 --> 16:07.842
[Daniel] Okay, bye.
- Bye.

16:07.842 --> 16:10.887
- [line chimes]
- [squeals shrilly]

16:10.887 --> 16:12.597
Yes! He is real!

16:12.597 --> 16:14.766
He is real!
Oh, my God!

16:14.766 --> 16:16.935
Yes! Quinn is back, bitches!

16:16.935 --> 16:19.270
Y'all better
hurry the fuck up.

16:19.270 --> 16:21.189
I got a date.

16:21.189 --> 16:23.358
Congrats?

16:23.358 --> 16:25.860
I mean, he did seem real.

16:25.860 --> 16:27.612
It's a sad day for society

16:27.612 --> 16:30.782
when all a man has to do
is exist.

16:30.782 --> 16:32.617
Touché, my sista.

16:32.617 --> 16:33.702
Mm.

16:36.329 --> 16:38.081
And I thought she was
allergic to lobster.

16:38.081 --> 16:39.541
You know that bitch is.

16:39.541 --> 16:41.626
a new grill...

16:41.626 --> 16:43.336
[Emmanuel] You are not
auditioning for them.

16:43.336 --> 16:44.879
They're auditioning for you.

16:44.879 --> 16:46.339
That's not really how it works.

16:46.339 --> 16:47.590
Yes, it is.

16:47.590 --> 16:48.883
You said no to that other part

16:48.883 --> 16:50.051
so you can get this one.

16:50.051 --> 16:51.761
And if not this part,

16:51.761 --> 16:53.471
then it'll be the next one.

16:53.471 --> 16:55.890
Even on the cloudiest day,

16:55.890 --> 16:59.436
the sun is also above you
in the sky somewhere.

16:59.436 --> 17:02.689
You got some pretty words,
Emmanuel.

17:02.689 --> 17:04.441
Thank you, Quinn.

17:04.441 --> 17:06.067
[Amine]

17:19.539 --> 17:21.916
Wait! I didn't get your number.

17:24.252 --> 17:26.588
Fuck.

17:26.588 --> 17:27.881
What do you bring to tea?

17:27.881 --> 17:29.674
I mean, if I bring flowers,
is it gonna seem

17:29.674 --> 17:30.884
like I feel like
we're on a date?

17:30.884 --> 17:32.177
I just want her to like me.

17:32.177 --> 17:33.970
She's Black. You're Black.
She has to like you.

17:33.970 --> 17:35.388
- That's the rule.
- Is it?

17:35.388 --> 17:37.015
Because there's definitely some
Black people we don't like.

17:37.015 --> 17:38.391
Ooh, French cuisine.

17:38.391 --> 17:40.560
- Fuck that noise!
- I mean fuck that noise.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.771
[Tye] I can't believe
they did this to Ray's.

17:42.771 --> 17:43.938
That was our spot.

17:43.938 --> 17:45.190
[Camille] It's all white.

17:45.190 --> 17:47.484
That's the new soul?

17:47.484 --> 17:49.486
Oh, yeah. There's definitely
gonna be a protest.

17:49.486 --> 17:50.820
Oh, hell yeah.
There needs to be.

17:50.820 --> 17:52.030
Should we go?

17:52.030 --> 17:53.323
[both] Uh...
- My grandmother is sick.

17:53.323 --> 17:56.618
I can't really be marching.
My knees are bad.

17:56.618 --> 17:59.829
[Quinn] But you should go.
You have a voice, Camille.

17:59.829 --> 18:02.123
And you're really passionate
about this kind of stuff.

18:02.123 --> 18:05.376
Yeah, but I mean, I do my thing
on the intellectual side

18:05.376 --> 18:06.836
with my research and writing.

18:06.836 --> 18:08.296
That's true.
That's true.

18:08.296 --> 18:10.215
[Camille] I mean, you start
talking in front of a crowd,

18:10.215 --> 18:11.591
the next thing you know,
you're fired.

18:11.591 --> 18:13.510
- I mean, look at Robin.
- I don't know, girl.

18:13.510 --> 18:14.886
I mean, I feel like
Black people are

18:14.886 --> 18:15.762
a little bit more forgiving.

18:15.762 --> 18:17.180
- Um...
- Look at Kanye.

18:17.180 --> 18:18.515
He's out here wearing MAGA hats

18:18.515 --> 18:20.391
and then he's ranting
incomprehensibly

18:20.391 --> 18:22.393
about Star Wars
housing for the homeless.

18:22.393 --> 18:24.521
And we still let him
preach in church.

18:24.521 --> 18:25.730
Nah, Quinn.

18:25.730 --> 18:28.525
Black Twitter,
Instagram, NewsOne,

18:28.525 --> 18:31.861
the Breakfast Club,
all of them will drag your ass.

18:31.861 --> 18:33.613
We can't have our girl Camille
canceled

18:33.613 --> 18:35.031
before she even gets started.

18:35.031 --> 18:36.991
Yeah, and I don't want
to be labeled

18:36.991 --> 18:39.452
the Uncle Tom bed-wench who
brought kale to the cookout.

18:39.452 --> 18:41.287
- Ooh, no.
- What's wrong with kale?

18:41.287 --> 18:43.331
Were her parents the only
Black people she grew up with?

18:43.331 --> 18:44.958
No, girl.
You add a little bit of garlic,

18:44.958 --> 18:46.793
some butter, girl,
you add some bacon.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.211
Ah-ha! It's poppin'.

18:48.211 --> 18:50.213
- Bitch, that ain't kale.
- That's greens.

18:50.213 --> 18:52.257
- Is it?
- Yeah.

18:52.257 --> 18:53.842
[Tye laughs]

18:53.842 --> 18:55.969
So it's a work in progress,

18:55.969 --> 18:59.305
but, see, the front
is all Michelle Obama.

18:59.305 --> 19:01.015
Good, strong girl vibes, right?

19:01.015 --> 19:04.978
But spin around,
and the back screams...

19:04.978 --> 19:07.522
Hell yes, I'll blow you in
the coat closet before dessert.

19:07.522 --> 19:09.691
Oh, my God, no, I was just
going for a little sexy.

19:09.691 --> 19:11.734
I don't blow in a coat closet
or eat dessert.

19:11.734 --> 19:13.736
Should I put on something else?
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

19:13.736 --> 19:15.280
Okay, makeup.

19:15.280 --> 19:16.656
Eye shadow, lipstick.

19:16.656 --> 19:19.742
Does it say future CEO's wife
or basketball wife?

19:20.827 --> 19:22.787
Angie, what's wrong?

19:22.787 --> 19:24.831
I met a guy who gets me.

19:24.831 --> 19:26.708
Like, really gets me.

19:26.708 --> 19:29.043
Oh, my God, honey.

19:29.043 --> 19:30.503
This is amazing.

19:30.503 --> 19:32.255
You deserve a good guy.

19:32.255 --> 19:33.548
Just like my Daniel.

19:33.548 --> 19:35.592
Sure, except my guy's,
like, you know, real.

19:35.592 --> 19:37.302
Bitch, Daniel is real.

19:37.302 --> 19:38.761
He is video-verified.

19:38.761 --> 19:39.929
Until he's not.

19:39.929 --> 19:41.472
Please, just support me.

19:41.472 --> 19:43.391
I do. But, girl, come on.

19:43.391 --> 19:45.226
Your dates are
never just dates.

19:45.226 --> 19:46.227
They always come
with some fucking

19:46.227 --> 19:47.979
weird asterisks or caveat.

19:47.979 --> 19:49.480
[groaning] I know!

19:49.480 --> 19:50.940
And I hate it, okay?

19:50.940 --> 19:53.067
God, I just want simple.

19:53.067 --> 19:54.360
I just want sweet.

19:54.360 --> 19:56.404
I have been looking for love,

19:56.404 --> 19:58.698
real love, for so long.

19:58.698 --> 20:01.367
And it has to be my turn.

20:01.367 --> 20:04.078
Universe, hear me manifest.

20:04.078 --> 20:06.706
Daniel is the one.

20:06.706 --> 20:09.083
Okay. Daniel is the one.

20:09.083 --> 20:11.044
Maybe my guy is too.

20:11.044 --> 20:12.420
If I ever find him.

20:12.420 --> 20:13.713
Why wouldn't you find him?

20:13.713 --> 20:16.549
'Cause he was a driver
in a...subway...

20:16.549 --> 20:18.217
subway driver.

20:18.217 --> 20:20.428
And he was an artist also,
like me.

20:20.428 --> 20:22.764
And we vibed so hard.

20:22.764 --> 20:25.475
And now I am kicking myself
for not getting his number

20:25.475 --> 20:28.519
before he drove...
I stepped off the train.

20:28.519 --> 20:31.981
Girl, so?
You know the train.

20:31.981 --> 20:33.733
Go back to that train again

20:33.733 --> 20:35.360
and again

20:35.360 --> 20:38.446
and again until you find him.

20:38.446 --> 20:39.948
Oh, my God!
[squeals]

20:39.948 --> 20:41.532
This is like a real meet-cute,

20:41.532 --> 20:44.035
like out of a Kate Hudson film
or something.

20:44.035 --> 20:46.704
I don't know who that is,
but it sounds lovely.

20:46.704 --> 20:48.373
Thank you, Quinny.

20:48.373 --> 20:51.084
Girl, go find your man.
Go find him.

20:51.084 --> 20:53.336
- And you claim yours.
- I will.

20:53.336 --> 20:54.963
[giggles]

20:56.089 --> 20:58.800
Oh wait, hold up.
Makeup?

20:58.800 --> 21:01.135
Yes to the eyes.
Hard no for the lips.

21:01.135 --> 21:02.553
- Yeah. I can do that.

21:07.517 --> 21:09.268
Come on, Emmanuel.

21:09.268 --> 21:10.645
See me.

21:10.645 --> 21:11.896
Cancel.

21:11.896 --> 21:14.774
Request.

21:14.774 --> 21:16.109
Cancel.

21:16.109 --> 21:17.860
Request.

21:17.860 --> 21:21.239
Okay, this is the one.

21:21.239 --> 21:23.449
Come on, God.
Work with me.

21:23.449 --> 21:25.410
Bring me Emmanuel.

21:27.745 --> 21:29.372
Fuck no.

21:29.372 --> 21:30.665
Request.

21:30.665 --> 21:32.125
Cancel.

21:32.125 --> 21:33.584
Request.

21:33.584 --> 21:34.585
Cancel.

21:34.585 --> 21:36.504
I just want love too!

21:36.504 --> 21:38.131
Okay, request.

21:38.131 --> 21:39.841
Come on, Emmanuel.
Come on, Emmanuel.

21:39.841 --> 21:41.050
[groans] Cancel.

21:41.050 --> 21:44.429
[whimpers]
Oh, maybe.

21:44.429 --> 21:45.430
No.

21:45.430 --> 21:48.433
[gentle jazz music playing]

21:53.521 --> 21:55.481
[light chatter]

22:05.116 --> 22:07.660
- Professor Parks.
- Nora. Hi.

22:07.660 --> 22:09.203
What...what are you doing here?

22:09.203 --> 22:11.330
Dr. Pruitt wanted someone
to show her around campus,

22:11.330 --> 22:13.249
and I guess they were like,
"Nora Longbone because

22:13.249 --> 22:15.001
she's always available,"
because I don't have a life.

22:15.001 --> 22:16.794
- Oh.
[Nora] Anyways,

22:16.794 --> 22:19.380
she sent me the e-vite
as a thank-you.

22:19.380 --> 22:21.174
- There was an e-vite?
[Nora] Mm-hmm.

22:21.174 --> 22:23.259
This place is so cool.

22:23.259 --> 22:25.720
The bathroom has
a porcelain bidet.

22:25.720 --> 22:27.638
Um, do you think
she actually uses it?

22:27.638 --> 22:29.432
Or is it just for show?

22:29.432 --> 22:32.518
I have no idea, Nora.
Excuse me.

22:34.187 --> 22:35.480
[Dr. Pruitt] My appointment
here at Columbia

22:35.480 --> 22:37.982
could not have come
at a better time.

22:37.982 --> 22:40.526
You know, I've just started
a new project

22:40.526 --> 22:44.614
involving the thriving
free Black settlement

22:44.614 --> 22:49.786
that was destroyed in 1850s
to make room for Central Park.

22:49.786 --> 22:51.704
Oh, Seneca Village.

22:51.704 --> 22:54.082
That is so interesting,
Dr. Pruitt.

22:54.082 --> 22:55.208
Enlighten me.

22:55.208 --> 22:57.168
Camille.

22:57.168 --> 22:59.295
Cam...Camille Parks.
We met...met this morning.

22:59.295 --> 23:01.839
Ah, yes.
The one that loves to tweet.

23:01.839 --> 23:05.343
[clears throat] I actually did
my thesis on gentrification.

23:05.343 --> 23:07.011
And Seneca Village
could be considered

23:07.011 --> 23:10.139
one of the first gentrified
Black urban sites in New York.

23:10.139 --> 23:12.642
So if you are looking
for a research assistant...

23:12.642 --> 23:15.103
Then I am available
to start ASAP.

23:15.103 --> 23:16.646
[Dr. Pruitt] Okay.

23:16.646 --> 23:18.731
Well, thank you both.

23:18.731 --> 23:22.902
It's just, as the other
Black woman in the department,

23:22.902 --> 23:25.321
um, it's such a...such
a personal subject to me...

23:25.321 --> 23:27.031
[Nora] Exactly, Camille,
and when I think

23:27.031 --> 23:29.951
of the sacrifice
my people made in this city...

23:29.951 --> 23:32.578
- Aren't you from Oklahoma?
- I'm Lenape.

23:32.578 --> 23:34.247
My people were forced
to relocate

23:34.247 --> 23:36.040
from New York to Oklahoma.

23:36.040 --> 23:39.210
We truly thank you
for your ancestors' sacrifice.

23:39.210 --> 23:41.295
You know, recently,
I did a 23andMe

23:41.295 --> 23:44.048
and discovered
I'm 3.6% Japanese.

23:44.048 --> 23:45.550
I used to wonder
why I gravitated

23:45.550 --> 23:47.593
toward sushi and calligraphy.

23:47.593 --> 23:49.220
And it all made sense.

23:49.220 --> 23:52.473
Really gives new meaning
to the word "Caucasian."

23:52.473 --> 23:55.810
That's a lot to unpack.
[chuckles]

23:55.810 --> 23:56.936
Right?

23:56.936 --> 23:58.104
It's crazy.

24:01.023 --> 24:02.108
I heard you have a bidet.

24:06.904 --> 24:09.657
Thank you so much
for coming back.

24:09.657 --> 24:11.701
Okay.
I thought we covered everything

24:11.701 --> 24:13.244
pretty well
the last time I was here.

24:13.244 --> 24:14.745
No. Get your
little recorder thing out.

24:14.745 --> 24:16.080
I want this on record.

24:17.248 --> 24:18.541
Mm-hmm.

24:20.042 --> 24:25.173
Okay, so your "fetish" argument
doesn't work in the reverse.

24:25.173 --> 24:26.382
This may come as a shocker,

24:26.382 --> 24:28.259
but as a white woman
on a dating app,

24:28.259 --> 24:30.178
you're not a part
of the vulnerable class.

24:30.178 --> 24:33.347
You're actually the most
highly desired and sought-after

24:33.347 --> 24:35.933
of all ethnic groups,
straight or queer.

24:35.933 --> 24:38.019
And regardless
of who I may sleep with

24:38.019 --> 24:39.729
or have relationships with,

24:39.729 --> 24:43.274
this app is necessary
for the thousands of people

24:43.274 --> 24:46.110
who want to date
without having to explain why.

24:46.110 --> 24:49.071
Today people still
shouldn't be wearing blackface

24:49.071 --> 24:52.533
on Halloween or answering
ignorant-ass messages

24:52.533 --> 24:55.745
from people who just "have such
a thing for Black women."

24:56.954 --> 24:58.414
Now, off the record,

24:58.414 --> 25:01.292
you're the one who left
in the middle of the night.

25:01.292 --> 25:02.668
You didn't text.

25:02.668 --> 25:04.420
And you ate
my beef and broccoli.

25:04.420 --> 25:06.380
I don't know which one
I'm more upset about.

25:06.380 --> 25:08.674
Still off the record,
I didn't think we needed

25:08.674 --> 25:11.385
to pretend it was
anything more than it was.

25:11.385 --> 25:14.388
You weren't exactly sending
"let's do this again" vibes.

25:14.388 --> 25:16.891
Now, on the record,

25:16.891 --> 25:18.434
you're absolutely right.

25:18.434 --> 25:19.769
Your app is necessary.

25:19.769 --> 25:21.062
But I'm a journalist.

25:21.062 --> 25:24.398
And it's my job
to ask the tough questions.

25:24.398 --> 25:28.069
Like, might you be willing
to let this non-POC woman

25:28.069 --> 25:29.028
take you out?

25:29.028 --> 25:30.696
Off the record.
On a date.

25:30.696 --> 25:32.156
What?

25:32.156 --> 25:34.867
Well, at the very least,
I owe you a beef and broccoli.

25:37.995 --> 25:40.164
That, you do.

25:44.126 --> 25:46.671
Ah, you must be Quinn.

25:46.671 --> 25:47.922
Daniel's expecting you.

25:47.922 --> 25:49.340
Please come in.

25:49.340 --> 25:52.969
Oh. Um, are...are we...
are we having dinner here?

25:52.969 --> 25:54.720
Yes, food is provided.

25:58.891 --> 26:01.644
Perfect timing, Quinn.
We're just getting started.

26:05.523 --> 26:07.483
Help yourself
to a lobster roll.

26:07.483 --> 26:08.818
Okay.

26:10.778 --> 26:13.155
Now, what if I told you
that in just one year,

26:13.155 --> 26:17.493
you could all own
a Park Avenue penthouse?

26:17.493 --> 26:21.247
Well, when you sign up to be
an Herbal Wonderkind sales rep,

26:21.247 --> 26:25.376
you are taking a step closer
to that dream.

26:25.376 --> 26:27.920
- Thank you, Pam.
[Pam] You're welcome, Daniel.

26:27.920 --> 26:29.880
- Isn't this exciting, ladies?
[Quinn] Oh, my God.

26:29.880 --> 26:34.427
Are you fucking kidding me?
A pyramid scheme?

26:34.427 --> 26:37.596
Does the date happen
after this?

26:37.596 --> 26:39.598
Oh, sweetie.

26:42.727 --> 26:45.313
Dr. Pruitt.

26:45.313 --> 26:47.189
Before I go,
I just wanted to say

26:47.189 --> 26:49.525
I'm so very happy
that you're here.

26:49.525 --> 26:51.402
You know, honestly,
this is my first opportunity

26:51.402 --> 26:54.155
to work with a Black woman
since I got here six years ago.

26:54.155 --> 26:56.324
To have someone like you
mentor me,

26:56.324 --> 26:59.118
I mean, someone who really
understands my struggle, girl?

27:00.619 --> 27:02.455
Enlighten me, Camille.

27:02.455 --> 27:07.877
You tweet witty barbs
about injustice all day long.

27:09.337 --> 27:11.422
What struggle?

27:12.923 --> 27:15.509
- Um, well, I...
- It's a rhetorical question.

27:15.509 --> 27:16.594
Yeah, yeah.

27:16.594 --> 27:19.096
It's called social media
for a reason,

27:19.096 --> 27:22.433
'cause it's a great place
for people to come and talk.

27:22.433 --> 27:24.226
But let's be clear:

27:24.226 --> 27:26.854
that's all it is.

27:26.854 --> 27:30.316
Now, if you want
to talk about struggle,

27:30.316 --> 27:34.320
you got to get off your phone
and get out into the field,

27:34.320 --> 27:37.907
because to study culture
is to be in it.

27:37.907 --> 27:40.409
Not to observe it
from the outside

27:40.409 --> 27:42.578
but to actually live in it.

27:42.578 --> 27:44.955
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

27:44.955 --> 27:46.916
Yeah. Yeah.

27:46.916 --> 27:49.168
Good.
Good night.

27:52.880 --> 27:55.925
We have a protest
coming up, actually.

27:55.925 --> 27:57.927
- I mean, I...I do.
- By yourself?

27:57.927 --> 28:01.389
No, I am a part
of the GentriWhy movement.

28:01.389 --> 28:02.640
It's a coincidence.

28:02.640 --> 28:05.017
I was thinking that I need
to do more in-person work,

28:05.017 --> 28:09.146
so that's why...um, yeah,
that's why it's happening.

28:09.146 --> 28:11.607
Well, great.
And good night.

28:11.607 --> 28:13.401
And I'm giving a speech.
A great speech.

28:13.401 --> 28:14.985
It's gonna be so good.

28:14.985 --> 28:17.154
I hope it goes well.

28:19.115 --> 28:20.574
- This is your coat, right?
- Yeah.

28:23.452 --> 28:26.038
- [door slams]
- Shh, I'm sleeping.

28:26.038 --> 28:27.915
Oh, my God.
I am so sorry.

28:27.915 --> 28:29.458
It's just that it's Quinn.

28:29.458 --> 28:32.211
Your best friend who managed
to hit an all-time low

28:32.211 --> 28:33.879
in her tragic dating history.

28:33.879 --> 28:36.132
Only to wait for the A-train
for maybe an hour

28:36.132 --> 28:37.633
before they said
it wasn't running.

28:37.633 --> 28:41.804
And then I got ignored by
every single cab on the street.

28:41.804 --> 28:44.765
So I got to enjoy a brisk walk

28:44.765 --> 28:46.809
all the way home
in freezing rain

28:46.809 --> 28:48.769
because my Uber account
has been suspended

28:48.769 --> 28:50.229
due to excessive
cancellation fees.

28:50.229 --> 28:52.690
Would you happen to know
why that is, Angie?

28:52.690 --> 28:54.233
Yes.

28:54.233 --> 28:56.819
But it's your fault
for giving me love advice

28:56.819 --> 28:59.530
from a woman who sells
overpriced yoga pants.

28:59.530 --> 29:00.906
- What?
[Angie] Yes, bitch.

29:00.906 --> 29:03.367
I looked her up.
Kate Hudson movies lie.

29:03.367 --> 29:05.953
There is no meet-cute
in real life

29:05.953 --> 29:07.872
for a Brown girl in Manhattan.

29:07.872 --> 29:08.914
Amen.

29:08.914 --> 29:10.666
- [doorbell rings]
- Oh, good!

29:10.666 --> 29:13.169
Those are the cookies
that I ordered on my walk home.

29:13.169 --> 29:14.503
I thought
you didn't eat dessert.

29:14.503 --> 29:16.964
Bitch, new me.
Just answer the door.

29:16.964 --> 29:18.674
[Emmanuel] Insomnia cookies.

29:23.679 --> 29:26.599
- [squeals] Emmanuel!
- Quinn!

29:26.599 --> 29:27.850
[Quinn] Angie?

29:27.850 --> 29:29.768
I thought your name was Quinn.

29:29.768 --> 29:32.146
- What's going on?
- I'll explain later.

29:32.146 --> 29:34.565
- [grunts]
[Angie] How are you here?

29:34.565 --> 29:36.484
Postmates.
I brought your cookies.

29:36.484 --> 29:39.528
It's fate.
I can have a meet-cute too.

29:39.528 --> 29:41.071
I feel like Kate Hudson.

29:41.071 --> 29:42.573
Ooh, Quinn.

29:42.573 --> 29:44.992
It's my poet from Uber.

29:44.992 --> 29:47.786
Okay, great.
Can he get my account unlocked?

29:47.786 --> 29:49.497
Maybe if he unlocks me first.

29:51.123 --> 29:54.043
[Angie moaning]

29:56.462 --> 29:59.173
- [gasps] Hoo!
- Fuck!

29:59.173 --> 30:01.675
Oh, that was amazing.

30:01.675 --> 30:04.178
And unexpected.

30:04.178 --> 30:05.513
I just couldn't wait.

30:05.513 --> 30:08.474
So can we go to your place now
and fuck like adults?

30:08.474 --> 30:10.601
Oh, we're here.

30:10.601 --> 30:12.186
I know.

30:12.186 --> 30:13.771
I mean can we go up
to your place

30:13.771 --> 30:16.690
and, you know,
finish what we started?

30:16.690 --> 30:20.945
No, I mean this is my place.

30:20.945 --> 30:23.072
You live in your car?

30:23.072 --> 30:24.532
Like, you live in this car

30:24.532 --> 30:25.824
we've been riding around in
all day?

30:25.824 --> 30:27.368
Like, this is your home?

30:27.368 --> 30:29.954
Well, uh, poetry
doesn't really pay.

30:29.954 --> 30:32.665
And I mean, you get it.
We're artists.

30:32.665 --> 30:34.500
- Jesus.
- We don't chase coin.

30:34.500 --> 30:36.043
We chase inspiration.

30:36.043 --> 30:38.295
Mm, sure.
In theory.

30:38.295 --> 30:39.922
But no, fuck that.

30:39.922 --> 30:43.008
An artist also needs to eat.

30:43.008 --> 30:44.260
We are not the same.

30:44.260 --> 30:47.096
I don't even have a car
to live out of.

30:47.096 --> 30:50.391
Shit!
I have to call that director.

30:50.391 --> 30:53.102
I am doing Get Out.
I fucked up.

30:53.102 --> 30:54.436
I can't do this.

30:54.436 --> 30:57.523
[all] GentriWhy! GentriWhy!

30:57.523 --> 31:00.109
GentriWhy! GentriWhy!

31:00.109 --> 31:02.820
Oh, God, please don't
let this get crazy.

31:02.820 --> 31:05.864
The Black man invented food

31:05.864 --> 31:09.743
when we were pharaohs
in Africa.

31:09.743 --> 31:12.246
And now the white man thinks
he can come to Harlem

31:12.246 --> 31:14.039
and teach us how to eat?

31:14.039 --> 31:15.916
[crowd] No!
- What in the hotep?

31:15.916 --> 31:18.794
To that, I say, "Why?"

31:18.794 --> 31:21.380
[all] GentriWhy! GentriWhy!

31:21.380 --> 31:23.215
Now I'd like
to turn the mic over

31:23.215 --> 31:26.093
to Miss Dr. Camille Parks...

31:26.093 --> 31:27.428
"Miss Doctor"?

31:27.428 --> 31:30.514
...who's got a few
educated words to say.

31:30.514 --> 31:33.517
[cheers and applause]

31:38.480 --> 31:40.274
Uh...

31:40.274 --> 31:43.152
thank you, DaKwame.

31:43.152 --> 31:46.071
Um, maybe I should clear up
a...a few things first.

31:46.071 --> 31:50.242
Uh, all humans ate food.

31:50.242 --> 31:55.289
And, uh, most Black Americans
did not descend from pharaohs.

31:55.289 --> 31:57.625
We are West African.

31:57.625 --> 32:00.586
Uh...what else?

32:00.586 --> 32:02.046
Um...

32:02.046 --> 32:07.051
did you know that pharaohs
used to marry their sisters?

32:07.051 --> 32:10.512
It was crazy, right?

32:10.512 --> 32:12.222
Um...

32:14.600 --> 32:17.561
Sometimes with deceptions
in the name of love,

32:17.561 --> 32:19.188
we can lose ourselves,

32:19.188 --> 32:21.649
forget who we actually are.

32:21.649 --> 32:24.318
If you're here today,

32:24.318 --> 32:28.906
it's because Ray's meant
something to you, to Harlem.

32:28.906 --> 32:33.535
And it meant a lot
because it was ours.

32:33.535 --> 32:36.997
And, for real, we don't have
a lot that's ours.

32:36.997 --> 32:39.917
So when it's gone,

32:39.917 --> 32:42.544
a piece of us goes too.

32:42.544 --> 32:46.840
So I stand here today
not to say "GentriWhy"

32:46.840 --> 32:49.468
but "GentriWho."

32:49.468 --> 32:53.013
- Not us. Not anymore.
- [crowd cheering]

32:53.013 --> 32:56.558
So stand with me, Harlem,
as we boycott Chalmette

32:56.558 --> 32:58.727
and let them know, not us.

32:58.727 --> 33:02.523
- Not anymore.
- [crowd cheering]

33:02.523 --> 33:05.025
[all] GentriWho! GentriWho!

33:05.025 --> 33:07.861
GentriWho! GentriWho!

33:07.861 --> 33:10.322
GentriWho!
- Right on, Miss Doctor.

33:12.241 --> 33:14.034
[Camille] But eventually,
we find our way back...

33:14.034 --> 33:14.993
Thank you.

33:14.993 --> 33:16.328
...for better or for worse,

33:16.328 --> 33:17.496
to the truth.

33:17.496 --> 33:19.790
- Hi.
- What the fuck, Camille?

33:19.790 --> 33:21.458
- What?
- Come here.

33:26.839 --> 33:28.257
I'm the head chef here.

33:28.257 --> 33:29.800
What the fuck?

33:29.800 --> 33:32.803
[hip-hop music]
