WEBVTT

00:06.640 --> 00:09.473
- What a great day. Cliff.
- Sammy.

00:09.600 --> 00:10.953
How you doing?

00:15.240 --> 00:16.434
Something funny?

00:16.560 --> 00:20.189
A salesman came by this morning
with these new napkins.

00:20.320 --> 00:22.311
Read that one. It's terrific.

00:22.440 --> 00:25.113
- This isn't funny.
- That's not the funniest.

00:25.240 --> 00:27.231
Read some of the others.

00:27.360 --> 00:29.078
- What others?
- Here.

00:29.200 --> 00:31.873
I bought 30 gross. Take your pick.

00:32.880 --> 00:36.668
30 gross of two hunters saying,
"Did I hear a buck snort?"

00:36.800 --> 00:40.839
No. They're all different, Sam.

00:45.320 --> 00:47.072
Well, I'll be darned.

00:49.320 --> 00:51.072
That salesman.

00:52.680 --> 00:55.831
But two bucks snorting
is funny every time.

00:57.680 --> 00:59.750
You should've asked me first.

00:59.880 --> 01:04.953
Sorry. I was sure you'd love 'em.
These are real conversation starters.

01:05.080 --> 01:07.275
No, this is not
a conversation starter.

01:07.400 --> 01:09.868
- Seen these awful napkins?
- Yeah. They stink.

01:10.480 --> 01:13.074
See what I mean?
The place is a-buzz.

<i>The Sox need a rally, they have</i>
<i>two out in the bottom of the ninth.</i>

02:33.080 --> 02:36.914
<i>The Yanks may have it sewn up</i>,
<i>as they lead 5-0. The pitch.</i>

02:37.040 --> 02:42.512
- Here's your drinks. Go, Red Sox!
- Miss, which drink is which here?

02:42.640 --> 02:45.677
What does this look like,
the Pepsi Challenge?

02:46.680 --> 02:48.750
Carla's getting her drinks mixed up

02:48.880 --> 02:51.110
because she's watching
that silly game.

02:51.240 --> 02:53.231
Snitch face!

02:54.200 --> 02:57.351
If you'd tried that
at St Clete's School for Girls,

02:57.480 --> 03:00.597
we'd have given you a pink belly
that glowed in the dark.

03:01.960 --> 03:03.951
I'd kinda like to see that.

03:05.400 --> 03:08.790
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm.

03:08.920 --> 03:11.480
- Norman.
- How you doing, Norm?

03:11.600 --> 03:13.795
Cut the small talk
and give me a beer.

03:15.440 --> 03:16.793
How come you're late?

03:16.920 --> 03:20.151
The boss kept me after.
I got chewed out a bit.

03:20.280 --> 03:21.793
Yeah? What for?

03:21.920 --> 03:24.912
I don't know.
Guess he doesn't have a dog.

03:25.040 --> 03:28.476
Alright. Our prayers are answered.
Normie, babe.

03:28.600 --> 03:32.434
- Yastrzemski's up with a man on.
- The fountain of youth. C'mon.

03:32.560 --> 03:35.393
- Now we'll get something going!
- C'mon now.

03:35.520 --> 03:42.073
- You and me, Yaz. My hero. My man.
- Popped it up! Sox lose again.

03:42.200 --> 03:44.077
You old fossil!

03:44.200 --> 03:45.758
That's it. That does it.

03:45.880 --> 03:49.509
May I have your attention?
I have an announcement to make.

03:49.640 --> 03:55.112
As of right now, Carla Tortelli
is no longer a Red Sox fan.

03:57.320 --> 04:00.835
No, really, I mean it this time.

04:02.760 --> 04:05.797
Now stop that, OK?

04:06.400 --> 04:08.277
Have I said that before?

04:09.200 --> 04:11.270
Give everybody a drink on me, Sam.

04:13.880 --> 04:17.394
- What's the occasion, Fred?
- My sister, Louise, died.

04:20.200 --> 04:22.919
Congratulations.
Just in the nick of time.

04:23.040 --> 04:25.679
Yeah, I was getting
pretty low on funds.

04:25.800 --> 04:27.791
What's going on?

04:27.920 --> 04:31.230
Fred here is the youngest
of 12 brothers and sisters

04:31.360 --> 04:34.557
- of a very wealthy family.
- I never cared for any of 'em.

04:34.680 --> 04:38.958
Every time one of them dies,
Fred here inherits their money.

04:39.800 --> 04:41.392
I think that's ghoulish.

04:41.520 --> 04:43.829
So did we,
the first six or seven times.

04:45.440 --> 04:49.194
Remember the night two of 'em
drove off the cliff in the fog?

04:49.320 --> 04:51.675
- Talk about a party.
- Yeah.

04:51.800 --> 04:53.199
OK, how we doing here?

04:53.320 --> 04:56.357
Yeah, another one, Sam,
but hold the napkin.

04:59.600 --> 05:02.034
What do we have here?
A Red Sox bar?

05:02.160 --> 05:06.392
Sorry about that, fans.
Another tough one in the loss column.

05:09.120 --> 05:10.394
We're closed.

05:10.520 --> 05:15.150
I just came from a classic massacre
of Boston by the Yankees.

05:15.280 --> 05:18.955
Tonight on the news,
you can watch the lowlights.

05:20.520 --> 05:24.513
You know, I can't see
why you people are such bad losers.

05:24.640 --> 05:27.154
You've had so much experience.

05:28.600 --> 05:33.390
- Who do you like, the Yankees?
- Another swift Bostonian.

05:33.520 --> 05:35.112
Yeah, I'm a Yankee fan.

05:35.240 --> 05:37.959
Back in the real city,
they call me Big Eddie.

05:38.080 --> 05:39.513
Pig Eddie?

05:41.480 --> 05:46.873
You made good time getting here.
I still hear the TV tubes cooling.

05:47.000 --> 05:51.278
I left right after the Red Sox fans
had their seventh-inning wretch.

05:53.760 --> 05:57.275
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, gimme a draught.

06:01.480 --> 06:04.313
You know, Big Ed,
the Sox are doing OK.

06:04.440 --> 06:11.790
Yeah? Since 1918, the Yankees
have won 23 world championships.

06:11.920 --> 06:14.115
And the Sox, zip.

06:15.320 --> 06:19.950
Want to talk about major poets from
New England as opposed to New York?

06:20.080 --> 06:23.356
Want to talk about
Nobel Prize winners in medicine?

06:23.480 --> 06:25.232
No.

06:27.440 --> 06:29.192
Philistines.

06:29.320 --> 06:33.472
- Fred, another round for everybody?
- No, Louise didn't have much money.

06:33.600 --> 06:34.794
But I'll be back.

06:34.920 --> 06:37.832
My 90-year-old brother, Bob,
is so wired up,

06:37.960 --> 06:40.679
you can get the Super Station on him.

06:40.800 --> 06:43.758
- Alright.
- So long, Freddie!

06:43.880 --> 06:47.350
We'll be thinking of him
during the next electrical storm.

06:48.200 --> 06:50.077
- Bye.
- Night, Freddie.

06:52.720 --> 06:55.029
- You homesick for the Bronx?
- Yeah.

06:55.160 --> 06:56.798
Here.

06:59.480 --> 07:04.190
You'll have to forgive Carla,
she gets overemotional at times.

07:04.320 --> 07:07.995
But bear in mind,
you are in an alien camp.

07:08.120 --> 07:11.396
Tact is perhaps
your wisest recourse.

07:11.520 --> 07:14.512
What did you get,
a vocabulary for Christmas?

07:14.640 --> 07:18.269
How'd you like to take a flying leap
up a knuckle sandwich?

07:19.880 --> 07:22.030
You gather my inference.

07:23.880 --> 07:28.317
C'mon, everybody, take it easy.
We're trying to run a friendly bar.

07:28.440 --> 07:31.876
Everybody sit back, relax.
Read a napkin.

07:35.560 --> 07:36.913
Great shot, kid.

07:37.040 --> 07:39.759
Well, you must admit,
the man's a jackal.

07:42.840 --> 07:44.831
I know you.

07:44.960 --> 07:46.996
- What's your name?
- Sam Malone.

07:47.160 --> 07:50.675
- Yeah, that's it.
- Yeah, I usually get it right.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.595
You used to be a relief pitcher
for the Boston Red Sox.

07:55.720 --> 07:58.518
- That's right.
- Hey, you didn't stink.

07:58.640 --> 07:59.789
Thanks.

07:59.920 --> 08:02.992
As I recall,
you had a darned good hard slider.

08:03.120 --> 08:05.031
And you're schlepping drinks?

08:05.160 --> 08:07.469
The great Sam "Maybe" Malone.

08:08.440 --> 08:09.953
That is "Mayday".

08:10.960 --> 08:13.110
- Let me buy you a drink.
- No, thanks.

08:13.240 --> 08:16.152
I didn't mean all that stuff.
C'mon, have a drink.

08:16.280 --> 08:19.397
- I don't drink.
- A ball player that don't drink?

08:19.520 --> 08:21.590
He doesn't drink any more.

08:22.280 --> 08:26.637
That's what happened.
And I thought you just lost it.

08:28.320 --> 08:31.039
He licked his booze problem
three years ago.

08:31.160 --> 08:34.708
What was it like pitching
at two guys at the same time?

08:35.919 --> 08:40.515
What was it like coming in
with bases loaded, and so were you?

08:53.400 --> 08:57.029
- Easy. I got her.
- It's OK, everybody, I'm fine.

08:58.200 --> 09:02.159
Sammy, you get a minute,
you wanna put a head on this here?

09:03.840 --> 09:08.311
- You alright?
- I'd better get this looked at.

09:08.440 --> 09:11.876
Right. There's a doctor
lives right near here.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.788
No, I was thinking
more on the lines of an attorney.

09:15.920 --> 09:17.592
Here's a guy, he's excellent.

09:17.720 --> 09:19.312
Coach.

09:19.440 --> 09:22.557
No, thanks, I got my own,
and he's damn good.

09:22.680 --> 09:26.514
You're legally responsible
for the actions of your employees.

09:26.640 --> 09:30.599
- You know that?
- It was a stupid mistake. I'm sorry.

09:30.720 --> 09:33.871
Mistake? That was an assault
in front of witnesses.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.515
I didn't see anything. I still don't.

09:38.160 --> 09:41.436
Sam, I ain't got nothing
against you, you run a clean bar.

09:41.560 --> 09:44.199
Fire her
and I'll forget the whole thing.

09:44.320 --> 09:47.232
There must be
some other way to settle this.

09:47.360 --> 09:49.510
Yeah? What d'you suggest?

09:50.280 --> 09:53.272
Well, certainly,
an apology's in order. Carla.

09:53.400 --> 09:55.356
I'm willing to listen.

09:57.280 --> 10:02.149
Listen, Sam, you fire her,
or I'm gonna take everything you got.

10:06.720 --> 10:09.598
Well, that's it, happy hour is over.

10:16.680 --> 10:21.151
- What you did was reprehensible.
- You do what you can.

10:22.400 --> 10:25.756
- You talked to your lawyer?
- Yeah, I finally got through.

10:25.880 --> 10:28.235
- What did he say?
- If he's worth a dime,

10:28.360 --> 10:31.670
he said by statute and precedence
this would be a tort.

10:31.800 --> 10:34.712
And there is substantial grounds
for cause of action.

10:38.800 --> 10:42.793
- How did you know that?
- Well, I picked it up in pre-law.

10:42.920 --> 10:45.036
I thought you were an English major?

10:45.160 --> 10:49.438
That was after art
and before psychology.

10:51.880 --> 10:54.348
Is there anything
you weren't in college?

10:54.480 --> 10:56.277
Blonde.

10:59.040 --> 11:03.477
- Check the yearbook, Carla.
- Don't. Just stop.

11:03.600 --> 11:05.158
Sam.

11:07.280 --> 11:13.071
Look, I'm sorry I got you in trouble.
I promise it won't happen again.

11:13.200 --> 11:15.475
How am supposed to I believe that?

11:15.600 --> 11:17.830
You've flown off the handle
too often.

11:17.960 --> 11:19.313
When?

11:19.440 --> 11:24.036
You don't remember throwing a man's
change at him from across the bar?

11:24.160 --> 11:26.116
The correct change.

11:27.640 --> 11:32.760
Carla, look,
you have a history of being...

11:32.880 --> 11:36.350
- ...abusive with customers.
- I'll handle this.

11:38.840 --> 11:42.230
A history of being
abusive with customers.

11:44.080 --> 11:45.991
Sam, he was insulting you.

11:46.120 --> 11:48.793
You don't know
when you're being insulted?

11:48.920 --> 11:53.710
I appreciate you defending me,
but I'm used to people riding me.

11:53.840 --> 11:57.310
In Yankee Stadium
I had to face 50,000 Eddies.

11:57.440 --> 12:00.876
I can defend myself without
having to call in Spider Lady.

12:02.960 --> 12:05.758
I did make a couple of nice moves.
Like when I...

12:05.880 --> 12:08.872
Carla, sit down. Look.

12:11.240 --> 12:13.435
I'm your friend and I like you.

12:14.280 --> 12:19.035
But I'm also a businessman, and
as such I don't like what you did.

12:19.160 --> 12:24.314
Look, I could get tough. My lawyer
wants me to do what Eddie asked.

12:24.440 --> 12:25.998
Fire me?

12:29.960 --> 12:32.349
C'mon. That's crazy.

12:32.480 --> 12:35.995
Carla, I could lose the bar.

12:37.040 --> 12:43.479
Sam, you can't fire me.
I need this job. Think of my kids.

12:43.600 --> 12:47.434
If I didn't have this job,
I'd have to stay home with them.

12:50.800 --> 12:53.997
Sam, you're not actually
thinking about it, are you?

12:54.120 --> 12:57.999
- This is Carla we're talking about.
- I know it's Carla!

12:58.120 --> 13:01.112
Excuse me.
May I make a suggestion?

13:01.240 --> 13:03.151
Sure, honey, go ahead. What?

13:03.280 --> 13:07.114
Well, I have a close friend
who is a clinical psychologist.

13:07.240 --> 13:10.550
- That could work.
- What could work?

13:10.680 --> 13:13.911
Well, I don't know,
give the kid a chance to talk.

13:15.200 --> 13:19.955
This friend mentioned to me one time
that he has a therapy group

13:20.080 --> 13:23.356
for people who,
I hope you'll forgive me,

13:23.480 --> 13:26.040
for people who can't control
their tempers.

13:26.160 --> 13:30.312
- You think I'm wacko.
- Nobody used the word "wacko".

13:30.440 --> 13:34.069
You don't have to be wacko
to see a psychologist.

13:34.200 --> 13:38.637
Perfectly normal, happy people
consult psychologists.

13:38.760 --> 13:40.990
In fact, get ready to laugh,

13:41.120 --> 13:44.192
I have consulted him
professionally myself.

13:48.640 --> 13:51.108
Are you one of his better jobs?

13:53.720 --> 13:55.631
I'm trying to help you.

13:55.760 --> 13:58.035
Carla, it might do you a lot of good.

13:58.160 --> 14:00.071
Now you think I'm crazy.

14:00.200 --> 14:03.158
I think you're a person
with a lot of anger inside.

14:03.280 --> 14:05.236
Yeah? Well, stick it!

14:06.680 --> 14:08.910
C'mon, would you?

14:09.040 --> 14:14.398
Look, I grew up on Federal Hill
with six older brothers and sisters.

14:16.880 --> 14:20.555
I mean, I worked all my life
to get this mean.

14:20.680 --> 14:23.399
Now you're telling me
I have to learn nice?

14:23.520 --> 14:26.318
I'm giving you one more chance.
Take it.

14:30.320 --> 14:32.311
OK.

14:32.440 --> 14:38.276
Look, if I go see Whitey's shrink,
will you let me stay on?

14:39.280 --> 14:42.909
Show me you're serious,
get some help, and I'll keep you on.

14:43.040 --> 14:44.598
Thanks, Sam.

14:47.080 --> 14:49.469
- Come on, let's go home.
- This is great!

14:49.600 --> 14:53.673
Just great. A minute ago,
everything seemed so hopeless.

14:53.800 --> 14:56.394
We were gonna lose Carla forever.

14:56.520 --> 14:58.954
It's all turned around.
I feel wonderful.

14:59.080 --> 15:01.913
All we need worry about now
is Eddie taking my bar.

15:02.040 --> 15:03.996
That didn't last long.

15:05.000 --> 15:09.710
I'm sorry, pre-law was after
literature and before psycho...

15:09.840 --> 15:13.355
No, wait. Indian studies
totally slipped my mind.

15:13.480 --> 15:16.278
How could I forget that?
It changed my life.

15:23.120 --> 15:25.953
Fine, Eddie. Yeah.
See you in 15 minutes.

15:27.360 --> 15:30.193
- So, Ed's coming over?
- Yeah, he's on his way.

15:30.320 --> 15:32.311
When was he last here, Sam?

15:32.440 --> 15:33.714
Three weeks.

15:34.320 --> 15:36.788
Gee, then he's seen the napkins.

15:39.040 --> 15:40.393
Ed?

15:40.520 --> 15:43.432
You mean that swineherd Ed
that's suing you?

15:43.560 --> 15:44.993
Yeah, that's the one.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.911
I see what you're doing.

15:50.040 --> 15:52.998
You're taking advantage
of Carla's day off

15:53.120 --> 15:57.910
to bring Ed in and fool him
into thinking you've fired Carla.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.598
It's a crass ploy.

16:00.920 --> 16:04.993
I'm gonna tell him Carla's in therapy
and ask him to understand.

16:05.120 --> 16:06.678
My way's better.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.309
That Ed is not my favourite person.

16:12.440 --> 16:16.718
He's a big pansy making
a big fuss over some intense pain.

16:16.840 --> 16:18.831
How many times did you play hurt?

16:18.960 --> 16:22.555
- Now and then.
- I must've got hit by 100 fastballs.

16:22.680 --> 16:27.800
- In fact, it was my specialty.
- You specialised in getting hit?

16:27.920 --> 16:31.799
- Yeah.
- He led the league in HBPs twice.

16:31.920 --> 16:33.717
Hit By Pitches.

16:33.840 --> 16:37.549
I perfected it
when I was with the St Louis Browns.

16:37.680 --> 16:40.353
I could get to first base
on any pitch.

16:40.480 --> 16:45.190
What I'd do was, I'd get up there
and lean my body into the pitch.

16:45.320 --> 16:47.993
Sometimes I took one
right in the old melon.

16:48.120 --> 16:51.430
But I really
made a science out of it.

16:51.560 --> 16:53.278
I became a master.

16:53.400 --> 16:55.436
Here, try to miss me.

16:57.680 --> 16:58.874
Diane, stand there.

16:59.000 --> 17:02.709
Now, I got the batter's box
marked off back there

17:02.840 --> 17:04.830
at exactly 50 feet, six inches.

17:04.960 --> 17:07.520
You ready? OK, here we go.

17:08.520 --> 17:11.478
- Has he done this before?
- Lots.

17:12.760 --> 17:17.753
Diane, in those days, we didn't wear
batting helmets either.

17:18.240 --> 17:19.673
This is ridiculous.

17:19.800 --> 17:22.553
He'll stay there all night
unless you throw.

17:22.680 --> 17:25.319
OK, honey, I'm ready. Let her rip!

17:25.440 --> 17:29.115
- Come on, baby.
- Alright!

17:29.240 --> 17:32.630
- I won't get it anywhere near him.
- That's the whole point.

17:39.880 --> 17:41.916
I'm on my way to first.

17:42.920 --> 17:46.151
Way to hum, girl.
Right on the old honeydew.

17:46.280 --> 17:50.114
I really had to dive for that one,
but I still got the old touch.

17:50.840 --> 17:52.193
Hi, everybody.

17:53.720 --> 17:55.039
Carla. Hi.

17:55.160 --> 17:57.469
It's Carla. And Ed's on his way over.

17:57.640 --> 17:59.676
Thanks for reminding me.

17:59.800 --> 18:03.679
Carla. What the hell are you
doing here on your day off?

18:03.800 --> 18:09.113
I brought my shrink to meet you all.
He wanted to put names with faces.

18:09.240 --> 18:10.958
Dr Graham, this is my boss, Sam.

18:11.080 --> 18:12.479
- How do you do?
- Hi.

18:12.600 --> 18:18.311
- And this is Coach Pantusso.
- Hi. So you're a psychologist?

18:18.440 --> 18:20.237
Our jobs are a lot alike.

18:20.360 --> 18:23.432
Because we both listen
to people's problems all day?

18:23.560 --> 18:25.630
Well, there's that, too.

18:28.600 --> 18:30.830
It's really nice to meet you, Doctor.

18:30.960 --> 18:34.157
- Hello, Doctor.
- Hello, Diane. How are you?

18:34.280 --> 18:38.398
- In what sense?
- Pardon me?

18:39.120 --> 18:44.069
You mean, "How are you?",
not "How are you?"

18:44.200 --> 18:46.998
- If that's what you meant, I'm fine.
- Good.

18:47.120 --> 18:50.430
It's good to see you,
but I should get back to work.

18:50.560 --> 18:53.597
Nothing personal,
I'm just a hard worker.

18:53.720 --> 18:57.713
- Not that I'm obsessed with work.
- Diane, get some pretzels.

18:59.040 --> 19:00.393
Hi, Sam.

19:02.880 --> 19:04.438
What's she doing here?

19:04.880 --> 19:08.111
Ed, why don't you sit down
way over there?

19:09.400 --> 19:14.554
Listen, I asked you over here
to talk about Carla tonight.

19:14.680 --> 19:16.272
She's still working here.

19:16.400 --> 19:20.393
I thought my attorney
made my position clear on that.

19:20.520 --> 19:22.317
Well, yes, he did.

19:22.440 --> 19:24.192
Table for one. Sit down.

19:25.120 --> 19:30.433
See, Carla is seeing a therapist.
She's trying to work things out.

19:30.560 --> 19:35.270
She wants to be the kind of waitress
that you'd enjoy being waited on by.

19:35.960 --> 19:39.589
You just ended that sentence
with two prepositions.

19:39.720 --> 19:42.109
Don't you have customers
to deal with?

19:42.240 --> 19:44.435
That ended with a preposition, too.

19:44.560 --> 19:48.030
Don't you have customers
to deal with, mullet-head?

19:49.040 --> 19:50.393
Look...

19:55.480 --> 19:57.357
So, you're in therapy?

19:58.720 --> 20:00.438
Yes.

20:14.800 --> 20:17.917
I've come a long way, though.

20:18.480 --> 20:23.156
Well, I don't believe it,
and I want you outta here.

20:26.520 --> 20:29.273
Ed? It's a long process.

20:29.400 --> 20:30.628
- Sometimes...
- Sam?

20:36.080 --> 20:38.878
Ed, gimme a break.

20:39.720 --> 20:44.350
I've been working damn hard
and I'm better.

20:44.480 --> 20:47.119
- Yeah?
- Yes.

20:48.320 --> 20:51.039
Boston... stinks.

20:57.480 --> 21:01.598
- This bar stinks.
- No, it's alright.

21:04.720 --> 21:06.711
You're a crummy waitress.

21:06.840 --> 21:08.478
- Wait a minute.
- Let it go.

21:08.600 --> 21:11.239
- You're doing wonderfully.
- Hang in there.

21:14.040 --> 21:15.996
You're short.

21:20.560 --> 21:22.755
You're obnoxious.

21:25.880 --> 21:29.270
- You're a terrible dresser!
- That's low.

21:37.000 --> 21:40.675
Sam Malone was a terrible pitcher!

21:41.520 --> 21:44.432
Ted Williams was overrated!

21:45.800 --> 21:50.715
- Bobby Orr was a wimp!
- Eddie, I'd stay away from hockey.

21:52.880 --> 21:55.110
I hit a soft spot, huh?

21:55.240 --> 21:56.639
OK.

21:57.280 --> 22:05.039
The Bruins are a bunch
of ugly, stupid sissies!

22:05.960 --> 22:08.599
C'mon, Ed,
how much more do you need?

22:10.760 --> 22:13.558
OK, Sam.
I'm gonna drop the whole thing.

22:15.800 --> 22:18.598
Working here is punishment enough.

22:20.720 --> 22:23.280
I wish you hadn't said that
about the Bruins.

22:23.400 --> 22:25.118
Why, you a Bruins fan?

22:25.240 --> 22:27.390
No.

22:27.520 --> 22:29.829
I'm a Bruin.

22:31.720 --> 22:33.711
Let me walk you to your car.

22:36.880 --> 22:41.032
I wanna show you some of those
sissy things I got suspended for.

22:43.600 --> 22:45.511
Alright!

22:45.640 --> 22:49.918
- Carla, that was wonderful.
- I'm so proud of you.

22:50.040 --> 22:52.474
- A new woman.
- My psychologist...

22:52.600 --> 22:54.397
Carla, how did you do it?

22:54.520 --> 22:58.069
Nothing to it. I've been working
on this, haven't I, Doc?

22:58.200 --> 23:02.796
We had some great sessions. I just
used this trick Dr Graham taught me.

23:02.920 --> 23:06.230
I imagined a small point
way off in the distance...

23:06.360 --> 23:10.114
- Carla. Where's that beer?
- Shut up! We're celebrating!

23:10.240 --> 23:14.472
I just kept thinking of that point.
He never fazed me, I'm telling you.

23:14.600 --> 23:16.909
With a little deep breathing...
