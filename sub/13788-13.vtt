WEBVTT

00:06.087 --> 00:08.929
WHAT DID YOU DO
TO CHARLIE POTATOES?

00:08.929 --> 00:11.722
OH, RIGHT.

00:11.722 --> 00:14.135
THAT IS ACTUALLY
A REALLY FUNNY STORY,

00:14.135 --> 00:16.057
IF YOU'RE NOT
CHARLIE POTATOES.

00:16.057 --> 00:18.309
LAST NIGHT,
YOU HAD PIZZA,

00:18.309 --> 00:20.641
SO CHARLIE SMELLED LIKE
CHEESE AND PEPPERONI.

00:20.641 --> 00:22.983
ONE THING LED TO ANOTHER,
I CHEWED ON HIM,

00:22.983 --> 00:25.856
FELL ASLEEP, HAD THAT DREAM
ABOUT A CAR CHASING ME...

00:25.856 --> 00:28.529
( laughs )

00:28.529 --> 00:30.651
...WHICH IS ALL SORTS
OF IRONIC

00:30.651 --> 00:33.914
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT...
AND AREN'T MAD.

00:33.914 --> 00:37.498
CUDDLING CHARLIE POTATOES
IS HOW I GET TO SLEEP,

00:37.498 --> 00:38.829
AND I NEED TO SLEEP

00:38.829 --> 00:40.871
SO I CAN DREAM ABOUT
FAIRIES AND UNICORNS.

00:40.871 --> 00:43.164
I DON'T GET TO SEE THOSE
IN THE DAYTIME.

00:43.164 --> 00:45.506
WOW, I REALLY FEEL
TERRIBLE, CHLOE.

00:45.506 --> 00:47.718
WHAT CAN I DO
TO MAKE IT UP TO YOU?

00:47.718 --> 00:50.671
I'LL TAKE YOUR FAVORITE
TOY... ROBERT.

00:50.671 --> 00:52.763
( laughs )

00:52.763 --> 00:55.556
THAT'S FUNNY BECAUSE...
ROBERT, HIDE!

00:57.138 --> 01:00.181
I FELT REALLY BAD
ABOUT CHARLIE POTATOES.

01:00.181 --> 01:03.063
I'M SURE CHLOE WAS JUST JOKING
ABOUT ROBERT, THOUGH.

01:03.063 --> 01:05.566
BUT JUST TO BE SAFE, HE'S GONNA
LAY LOW WITH SOME FRIENDS

01:05.566 --> 01:07.738
TILL THE HEAT'S OFF.

01:25.626 --> 01:28.379
DID YOU GUYS HEAR
WHAT THE THEME IS FOR
THE EIGHTH GRADE DANCE?

01:28.379 --> 01:30.971
IT'S "AVERY HASN'T BEEN
ASKED YET," THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

01:30.971 --> 01:32.973
NO, I THINK IT'S
"UNDER THE SEA."

01:32.973 --> 01:35.426
I KNOW IT'S
"UNDER THE SEA."

01:35.426 --> 01:38.179
THE POINT IS,
I HAVE NO ONE TO GO WITH.

01:38.179 --> 01:40.221
I'M GONNA LOOK RIDICULOUS
IN MY MERMAID COSTUME

01:40.221 --> 01:41.852
WITHOUT A SAILOR
ON MY ARM.

01:41.852 --> 01:43.604
YOU KNOW IT'S NOT
A COSTUME DANCE.

01:43.604 --> 01:45.816
I AM REALLY GLAD
WE HAD THIS CONVERSATION.

01:45.816 --> 01:47.938
I HATE DANCES.

01:47.938 --> 01:50.191
I'M WAITING FOR A GUY
WHO HATES DANCES, TOO,

01:50.191 --> 01:51.992
TO ASK ME SO WE CAN
SPEND THE NIGHT GOING,

01:51.992 --> 01:54.195
"UGH, I HATE DANCES...

01:54.195 --> 01:56.947
"AND ORGANIZED SPORTS,
AND MUSICAL THEATER.

01:56.947 --> 01:59.740
WE HAVE SO MUCH
IN COMMON."

01:59.740 --> 02:01.702
WHAT WAS I THINKING,
BREAKING UP WITH TONY

02:01.702 --> 02:03.244
RIGHT BEFORE THE DANCE?

02:03.244 --> 02:05.005
I WAS THINKING, I CANNOT
SPEND ANOTHER MINUTE

02:05.005 --> 02:07.208
WITH SOMEONE WHO CALLS
HOT CHOCOLATE "HOT CHOCKY."

02:07.208 --> 02:09.550
PARDON ME. I COULDN'T
HELP OVERHEARING,

02:09.550 --> 02:12.713
BECAUSE I WAS EAVESDROPPING;
THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT.

02:12.713 --> 02:14.845
I AM PREPARED TO ESCORT
ANY ONE OF YOU TO THE DANCE.

02:14.845 --> 02:16.717
IT MATTERS NOT WHICH.

02:16.717 --> 02:19.260
I UNDERSTAND YOU'VE
NEVER ASKED ANYONE OUT BEFORE,

02:19.260 --> 02:22.062
BUT HAVE YOU AT LEAST
SEEN IT IN A MOVIE?

02:22.062 --> 02:26.437
I REALIZE I CAN BE
STRONG COFFEE,

02:26.437 --> 02:28.769
BUT IN AN EFFORT
TO MAKE FRIENDS,

02:28.769 --> 02:30.651
I WILL ENDEAVOR
TO AMELIORATE THAT.

02:30.651 --> 02:32.443
WHY DO YOU SUDDENLY
WANNA MAKE FRIENDS?

02:32.443 --> 02:34.615
FOR THE SAME REASON
EVERYONE DOES.

02:34.615 --> 02:36.487
TO HAVE SOMEONE SAY
"HOW TERRIBLY DROLL"

02:36.487 --> 02:39.330
WHEN I TOSS OF
A WITTY BON MOT.

02:39.330 --> 02:41.452
THAT'S NOT WHY
MOST KIDS
WANT FRIENDS.

02:41.452 --> 02:43.704
WELL, THE MASSES
ARE WRONG AGAIN.

02:43.704 --> 02:44.995
QUELLE SURPRISE!

02:46.337 --> 02:47.838
OH, MY GOSH.

02:47.838 --> 02:49.920
WHAT IF KARL IS
THE BEST WE CAN DO?

02:49.920 --> 02:52.463
THEN WE'D HAVE TO CUE
SOME TEEN MOVIE
MAKEOVER MUSIC,

02:52.463 --> 02:55.676
AND TURN THAT ZERO TO HERO.
GIRLS, ARE YOU WITH ME?
ON THREE.

02:55.676 --> 02:57.678
I'M TOTALLY KIDDING.

02:57.678 --> 03:00.351
LINDSAY, PULL
YOUR HAIR BACK.

03:02.513 --> 03:05.806
ALL RIGHT, BENNETT,
UPTON CARRIAGE HOUSE IS ON.

03:05.806 --> 03:07.398
YOU READY TO WATCH
OUR SHOW?

03:07.398 --> 03:09.940
YOU ALWAYS SAY
WE HAVE TO WATCH IT TOGETHER,

03:09.940 --> 03:12.733
AND THEN YOU FALL ASLEEP
WITHIN THE FIRST FIVE MINUTES.

03:12.733 --> 03:14.615
I REALLY WANNA FIND OUT
WHY LADY KENSINGTON

03:14.615 --> 03:16.907
WASN'T WEARING
HER WHITE GLOVES
AT HIGH TEA.

03:16.907 --> 03:18.949
IT SENT SHOCK WAVES
THROUGH THE CARRIAGE HOUSE.

03:18.949 --> 03:21.161
WELL, EXCUSE ME
IF I'M TIRED

03:21.161 --> 03:23.784
AFTER TAKING CARE OF
THE HOUSE AND KIDS ALL DAY.

03:23.784 --> 03:25.666
I SHOULD HAVE A STAFF
OF MAIDS AND BUTLERS

03:25.666 --> 03:27.828
CATERING TO
MY EVERY WHIM.

03:27.828 --> 03:29.710
I KNOW IF I TRACE
MY ANCESTRY BACK FAR ENOUGH,

03:29.710 --> 03:31.922
I'D FIND ROYALTY.
WHY ELSE DO I HAVE
THIS INSTINCT

03:31.922 --> 03:33.504
TO LOOK DOWN MY NOSE
AT COMMONERS?

03:33.504 --> 03:36.547
LOOK, I JUST WANNA WATCH
OUR SHOW TOGETHER.

03:36.547 --> 03:38.799
OTHERWISE,
IT'S JUST MY SHOW.

03:38.799 --> 03:41.972
AND IF IT WERE
MY SHOW, IT'D BE SPORTS.

03:43.554 --> 03:45.766
MOMMY, DADDY.

03:45.766 --> 03:47.848
I CAN'T SLEEP
WITHOUT CHARLIE POTATOES.

03:47.848 --> 03:49.940
CAN ONE OF YOU
COME LAY DOWN WITH ME?

03:49.940 --> 03:51.692
I'LL LAY DOWN
WITH YOU, SWEETIE,

03:51.692 --> 03:53.113
EVEN THOUGH IT'S
PROBABLY BENEATH MY STATION.

03:53.113 --> 03:55.115
IT'S FINE, IT'S FINE.

03:55.115 --> 03:56.987
BENNETT, DON'T WATCH
WITHOUT ME,

03:56.987 --> 03:59.410
OR WE'RE GETTING SEPARATE DVR's.
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT LEADS TO.

03:59.410 --> 04:01.822
OH, YEAH, BEING ABLE
TO RECORD WHAT I WANT

04:01.822 --> 04:05.245
AND WATCH WHEN I WANT.
OOH, WHAT A NIGHTMARE.

04:05.245 --> 04:07.628
HEY, GREAT NEWS, DAD.

04:07.628 --> 04:10.581
I'M GONNA BE DEEJAYING
THE EIGHTH GRADE DANCE
ON FRIDAY.

04:10.581 --> 04:13.083
IT'S GONNA BE MY FIRST
PAYING DEEJAY GIG.
I HOPE IT GOES WELL.

04:13.083 --> 04:16.797
GOES WELL? AREN'T YOU JUST
PLUGGING INTO YOUR EQUIPMENT
AND PRESSING PLAY?

04:16.797 --> 04:18.759
YOU'RE MAKING DEEJAYING
SOUND WAY EASIER

04:18.759 --> 04:20.801
THAN IT ACTUALLY IS.

04:20.801 --> 04:22.723
THERE'S A WHOLE ART
TO BENDING PITCH,

04:22.723 --> 04:24.685
MATCHING BEATS, AND CREATING
A SONIC LANDSCAPE.

04:24.685 --> 04:26.647
PLUS, I PUT MY HANDS
IN THE AIR,

04:26.647 --> 04:28.849
AND WAVE 'EM
LIKE I JUST DON'T CARE.

04:28.849 --> 04:30.651
THE TRUTH IS,
I DO CARE A LITTLE,

04:30.651 --> 04:32.853
AND THAT'S
THE HARD PART.

04:32.853 --> 04:34.445
( snoring )

04:34.445 --> 04:37.027
OH, I GUESS YOUR MOM'S
DOWN FOR THE NIGHT.

04:37.027 --> 04:39.069
AND I CAN'T WATCH
UPTON CARRIAGE HOUSE.

04:39.069 --> 04:41.201
I GUESS YOU AND I
COULD SIT AND TALK

04:41.201 --> 04:42.993
FOR A WHILE, HUH?

04:42.993 --> 04:44.665
OKAY.

04:53.213 --> 04:55.295
- GOOD NIGHT, SON.
- GOOD NIGHT, DAD.

04:57.878 --> 05:00.761
HEY, I OVERHEARD ABOUT
THE DEEJAY GIG, TY.

05:00.761 --> 05:02.513
VERY COOL.

05:02.513 --> 05:04.475
SO WHO REPPED YOU
IN THE NEGOSH?

05:04.475 --> 05:06.727
THAT'S MUSIC BIZ LINGO
FOR NEGOTIATION.

05:06.727 --> 05:09.600
BIZ IS SHORT FOR
BYZANTIUM... I THINK.

05:09.600 --> 05:11.692
PRETTY SURE.

05:11.692 --> 05:13.524
MIGHT HAVE TO
LOOK THAT UP.

05:13.524 --> 05:14.895
WHAT NEGOTIATION?

05:14.895 --> 05:16.987
THEY OFFERED ME $20
TO PLAY THE DANCE.

05:16.987 --> 05:18.739
I SAID, ARE YOU KIDDING?
I'D DO IT FOR FREE.

05:18.739 --> 05:20.611
SO YOU'RE DOIN' IT
FOR FREE.

05:20.611 --> 05:22.653
I'M ALSO PAYING FOR
MY OWN TICKET.

05:22.653 --> 05:24.745
YOU SEE, THIS IS WHY
YOU NEED ME

05:24.745 --> 05:26.707
TO STEP IN
AS YOUR MANAGER.

05:26.707 --> 05:28.749
I'LL GET YOU
A BETTER "D,"

05:28.749 --> 05:30.621
WHICH IS SHORT FOR
"DEALIE-O,"

05:30.621 --> 05:32.453
WHICH IS LONG FOR
"DEAL."

05:34.715 --> 05:36.877
SO I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE
WITH THE ASSISTANT PRINCIPAL,

05:36.877 --> 05:39.089
AND THE GOOD NEWS IS,

05:39.089 --> 05:41.762
YOU'RE NOT WORKING FOR
LOW MONEY, AND YOU
DON'T HAVE TO BUY

05:41.762 --> 05:43.053
- YOUR OWN TICKET
TO THE DANCE.
- YES!

05:43.053 --> 05:45.636
THE BAD NEWS IS,
YOU'RE FIRED,

05:45.636 --> 05:48.348
AND I LIED TO YOU ABOUT
NOT HAVING TO BUY YOUR
OWN TICKET TO THE DANCE.

05:48.348 --> 05:49.770
WHAT?

05:49.770 --> 05:51.271
DON'T BLAME YOURSELF.

05:51.271 --> 05:52.733
COULD'VE HAPPENED TO ANYONE.

05:52.733 --> 05:55.065
BUT I MIGHT HAVE TO
DROP YOU AS A CLIENT. TOOTS.

05:55.065 --> 05:56.647
IS THAT SHORT FOR
"TOODLE-OO"?

05:56.647 --> 05:58.689
NO, I FARTED.

06:00.941 --> 06:02.743
LINDSAY, CONGRATULATIONS.

06:02.743 --> 06:04.825
I HEARD THAT
PETER MURPHY
ASKED YOU TO THE DANCE.

06:04.825 --> 06:06.827
OH, YEAH, BUT THEN
I BROKE UP WITH HIM.

06:06.827 --> 06:08.659
HE'S REALLY CUTE,
BUT HE'S ALWAYS
DOING CARTWHEELS,

06:08.659 --> 06:10.250
AND HE'S NOT EVEN
ON THE GYMNASTICS TEAM.

06:10.250 --> 06:13.834
- YES, HE IS.
- OH. WELL, EVEN SO.

06:13.834 --> 06:15.546
SO WORD ON THE RUMOR MILL

06:15.546 --> 06:17.458
IS WES IS GOING TO ASK
YOU TO THE DANCE.

06:17.458 --> 06:20.841
I'VE BEEN WANTING HIM
TO ASK ME OUT FOR MONTHS.

06:20.841 --> 06:22.713
WHAT IF HE DOES?
WHAT WOULD I SAY?

06:22.713 --> 06:24.845
I'D SAY YES,
BUT HOW WOULD I SAY IT?

06:24.845 --> 06:26.967
"WES, WOULD I?

06:26.967 --> 06:30.270
YES. OH, MY GOSH, YES!
YES, YES, YES!"

06:31.351 --> 06:33.564
TOO BIG?

06:33.564 --> 06:35.646
YOU MAY WANNA LEAVE
YOURSELF SOME HEAD ROOM

06:35.646 --> 06:37.227
IN CASE YOU WIN
THE LOTTERY.

06:38.228 --> 06:39.610
HEY, AVERY.

06:39.610 --> 06:40.941
- SUPER CASUAL.
- WHAT?

06:40.941 --> 06:43.193
THAT WAS MORE FOR ME.
I MEANT, HEY, WES.

06:44.364 --> 06:45.986
WOULD YOU GUYS
LIKE TO GET GOING?

06:45.986 --> 06:47.618
WOULD I? YES.

06:47.618 --> 06:49.910
OH, MY GOSH,
YES, YES, YES, YES.

06:51.952 --> 06:55.375
AVERY, WOULD YOU LIKE
TO GO TO THE DANCE WITH ME?

06:55.375 --> 06:57.207
YES! SUPER CASUAL.

06:57.207 --> 07:00.130
- SURE.
- GREAT. I'M LOOKING
FORWARD TO IT.

07:00.130 --> 07:02.633
ME, TOO. EVERYONE'S
MEETING AT MY HOUSE
BEFOREHAND.

07:02.633 --> 07:05.345
I'LL SEE YOU THERE.
I HOPE YOU LIKE DANCING
AS MUCH AS I DO.

07:07.468 --> 07:09.550
IT'S A LITTLE BETTER
TO MUSIC.

07:09.550 --> 07:12.312
YEAH, IT WAS STILL
PRETTY GOOD.

07:12.312 --> 07:15.315
I'D SHOW YOU MY MOVES,
BUT I'M A LITTLE EXHAUSTED.

07:15.315 --> 07:17.648
LAST NIGHT,
MY CREW AND I

07:17.648 --> 07:20.060
WERE DANCE BATTLING
TO SAVE A LOCAL REC CENTER.

07:20.060 --> 07:22.152
THIS IS GONNA BE FUN.
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

07:23.694 --> 07:26.366
DID YOU GUYS SEE THAT?
HE LOVES TO DANCE.

07:26.366 --> 07:28.699
YOU KNOW I CAN'T DANCE.

07:32.993 --> 07:34.495
SORRY, MISTER...

07:34.495 --> 07:37.498
- Both: HAYDEN.
- HAYDEN.

07:37.498 --> 07:40.631
THAT WAS THE BEST
I'VE EVER DANCED.

07:40.631 --> 07:42.342
I FINALLY HAVE
MY FIRST DATE WITH WES,

07:42.342 --> 07:44.464
AND I'M GONNA MAKE
A TOTAL FOOL OUT OF MYSELF.

07:44.464 --> 07:46.547
I THOUGHT WE WERE JUST
GONNA HANG OUT BY
THE SNACKS AND TALK.

07:46.547 --> 07:48.138
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

07:48.138 --> 07:50.140
YOU HAVE TIME TO PRACTICE.

07:50.140 --> 07:53.143
AND A PLACE TO PRACTICE
NOW THAT YOU AND YOUR CREW
SAVED THE REC CENTER.

07:57.648 --> 07:59.810
WELL, I GOT MY GIG BACK.

07:59.810 --> 08:01.862
YES! AS YOUR NEW
CO-DEEJAY,

08:01.862 --> 08:03.694
I COULD NOT BE
MORE THRILLED.

08:03.694 --> 08:05.155
YOU'RE NOT MY CO-DEEJAY.

08:05.155 --> 08:06.987
I GUESS YOU DIDN'T
READ THE FINE PRINT

08:06.987 --> 08:08.699
WHEN YOU SIGNED
THOSE MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS.

08:08.699 --> 08:10.110
I DIDN'T SIGN ANYTHING.

08:10.110 --> 08:13.163
ARE YOU SAYING
THIS ISN'T YOUR SIGNATURE?

08:13.163 --> 08:14.705
THAT'S YOUR PAW PRINT.

08:14.705 --> 08:16.787
OF COURSE IT IS.

08:16.787 --> 08:19.169
YOU GAVE ME POWER OF ATTORNEY
WHEN YOU SIGNED THIS.

08:19.169 --> 08:21.421
SO... FOR COSTUMES,
WHAT DO YOU THINK,

08:21.421 --> 08:23.503
SEQUINS OR LIGHTNING BOLTS?

08:23.503 --> 08:25.295
- WHAT?
- I'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

08:25.295 --> 08:26.677
I'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

08:28.799 --> 08:31.722
( dance music playing )

08:41.141 --> 08:42.773
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

08:42.773 --> 08:45.525
I'M JUST TRYING
TO DANCE LIKE YOU.

08:45.525 --> 08:47.357
YOU'RE DANCING LIKE WHEN
I WAS TWO,

08:47.357 --> 08:49.409
AND I HAD TO GO
TO THE BATHROOM.

08:49.409 --> 08:51.782
AND EVEN WITH A FULL DIAPER,
I WAS BETTER THAN THAT.

08:51.782 --> 08:54.284
TYLER, THIS DANCE IS GONNA BE
MY FIRST DATE WITH WES.

08:54.284 --> 08:56.326
I CAN'T EMBARRASS MYSELF.

08:56.326 --> 08:58.538
YOU HAVE TO TEACH ME
TO DANCE.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.871
I DON'T DANCE.
I ROCK OUT.

09:00.871 --> 09:02.422
YOU DON'T TEACH THAT,
IT JUST HAPPENS.

09:02.422 --> 09:04.625
TEACH ME HOW TO MAKE IT
JUST HAPPEN.

09:04.625 --> 09:06.667
I'M PRETTY SURE
THAT WOULD INVOLVE YOU

09:06.667 --> 09:09.630
LIVING YOUR ENTIRE
LIFE UP TO NOW
COMPLETELY DIFFERENTLY.

09:09.630 --> 09:11.842
EXCUSE ME.
I WAS LYING IN WAIT,

09:11.842 --> 09:13.383
SO I COULDN'T
HELP OVERHEARING.

09:13.383 --> 09:15.175
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE, KARL?

09:15.175 --> 09:18.098
I HEARD MUSIC, AND I ASSUMED
YOU WERE HAVING A PARTY

09:18.098 --> 09:20.641
AND DIDN'T INVITE ME,
SO I CAME.

09:20.641 --> 09:24.024
LOOKING FOR SOMEONE
TO TEACH YOU TO DANCE?
CHECK THIS.

09:32.613 --> 09:34.404
KARL FINALLY DID IT.

09:34.404 --> 09:36.827
HE BUILT A ROBOT THAT
LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE HIM,

09:36.827 --> 09:38.829
AND PROGRAMMED
HIM TO DANCE.

09:38.829 --> 09:40.661
NOW YOU'VE HURT MY FEELINGS.

09:40.661 --> 09:42.412
OH, MY GOSH.
IT'S SELF-AWARE.

09:44.044 --> 09:46.627
I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT
I'M ABOUT TO SAY THESE WORDS,

09:46.627 --> 09:49.469
BUT, KARL, CAN YOU
TEACH ME TO DANCE LIKE YOU DO?

09:49.469 --> 09:51.802
FOR A PRICE.
I UNDERSTAND
YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS

09:51.802 --> 09:54.014
ARE GOING TO THE DANCE
AS A GROUP.

09:54.014 --> 09:57.177
AS I TOLD YOU,
I AM SEEKING FRIENDSHIP
SO I WISH TO BE INCLUDED.

09:57.177 --> 09:59.680
- YOU WANNA BE OUR FRIEND?
- OH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

09:59.680 --> 10:01.521
I WANNA BE SEEN AS
GOOD FRIEND MATERIAL

10:01.521 --> 10:03.523
TO ATTRACT OTHERS
BETTER THAN YOU.

10:03.523 --> 10:06.026
I REQUIRE NOTHING MORE
THAN FOR YOU TO
CIRCLE AROUND ME

10:06.026 --> 10:08.689
AS THOUGH I'M
THE CENTER OF YOUR UNIVERSE

10:08.689 --> 10:10.781
- AND FOR YOU TO HANG ON
TO MY EVERY WORD.
- THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

10:10.781 --> 10:13.233
CAN I STILL PLEASE
GO WITH YOU GUYS?

10:13.233 --> 10:14.614
FINE.

10:14.614 --> 10:15.946
YOU KNOW, KARL,

10:15.946 --> 10:17.698
INSTEAD OF HAVING TO
MAKE DEALS LIKE THIS,

10:17.698 --> 10:18.869
YOU CAN JUST BE NICE
AND CHILL,

10:18.869 --> 10:20.831
AND PEOPLE WOULD
LIKE YOU.

10:20.831 --> 10:24.244
I ENVY HOW EASILY
THE BASER SKILLS
COME TO SIMPLE MINDS.

10:24.244 --> 10:25.625
IT IS PRETTY GREAT.

10:27.457 --> 10:29.049
THIS COFFEE
IS NOT ENOUGH.

10:29.049 --> 10:31.171
I BARELY SLEPT LAST NIGHT
IN CHLOE'S ROOM.

10:31.171 --> 10:33.714
HER BED WAS SO SMALL,
I SLEPT ON THE FLOOR.

10:33.714 --> 10:35.095
I WOKE UP WITH
CARPET FACE.

10:35.095 --> 10:37.718
WHEN WILL IT GO AWAY?

10:37.718 --> 10:40.851
SO WE'RE NOT WATCHING
UPTON CARRIAGE HOUSE?

10:40.851 --> 10:42.723
NO, WE'RE GOING
TO WATCH IT.

10:42.723 --> 10:44.815
I'M STAYING UP;
I AM DETERMINED.

10:53.734 --> 10:56.076
( snoring )

10:57.037 --> 10:58.739
HONEY.

10:58.739 --> 11:00.781
HONEY!

11:01.782 --> 11:03.784
( snorts )

11:07.247 --> 11:10.380
- MOMMY.
- YES, SWEETIE,
WHAT IS IT?

11:10.380 --> 11:12.672
I CAN'T SLEEP
WITHOUT YOU.

11:12.672 --> 11:14.715
YOU'RE MY NEW
CHARLIE POTATOES.

11:14.715 --> 11:17.557
COME SLEEP WITH ME,
MOMMY POTATOES.

11:20.300 --> 11:22.562
OKAY, SWEETIE,

11:22.562 --> 11:24.264
DADDY'S GONNA WATCH
UPTON CARRIAGE HOUSE

11:24.264 --> 11:25.726
WHILE YOU CURL UP
NEXT TO MOMMY

11:25.726 --> 11:27.147
AND GET SOME
SLEEP, OKAY?

11:27.147 --> 11:28.939
YAY!

11:31.691 --> 11:34.945
OH, I AM GONNA PAY
FOR WATCHING THIS
WITHOUT HER.

11:34.945 --> 11:37.908
BUT, LIKE DEREK,
THE BOLD UPTON STABLE BOY,

11:37.908 --> 11:40.490
I'M GONNA LIVE
FOR TODAY.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.744
( horse neighing )

11:43.744 --> 11:45.375
( thud )

11:45.375 --> 11:47.377
OH, DEREK!

11:48.538 --> 11:50.710
THIS DOES NOT
BODE WELL FOR ME.

11:55.095 --> 11:57.097
HELLO, FRIEND.
CAN I CALL YOU THAT?

11:57.097 --> 11:58.799
I'M TRYING TO MAKE
NEW FRIENDS,

11:58.799 --> 12:00.600
AND HOPING TO TRADE
ON YOUR POPULARITY.

12:02.052 --> 12:04.434
PERHAPS I CAN BE
THE FRIEND WHO
TELLS IT LIKE IT IS.

12:04.434 --> 12:06.476
THAT BAND ON YOUR SHIRT
IS PASSE.

12:06.476 --> 12:09.149
AREN'T I JUST
A BREATH OF FRESH AIR?

12:09.149 --> 12:11.852
YOU'RE AVERY'S
NEIGHBOR, RIGHT?

12:11.852 --> 12:13.854
OH, AVERY AND I ARE
MORE THAN NEIGHBORS,
ESPECIALLY LATELY,

12:13.854 --> 12:16.156
SINCE I'VE BEEN GOING
TO HER HOUSE EVERY EVENING

12:16.156 --> 12:18.278
AND... I'M NOT SURE
IF SHE WANTS ME TO SAY.

12:18.278 --> 12:20.781
ARE YOU GUYS
STUDYING TOGETHER?

12:20.781 --> 12:22.823
STUDYING? NO.

12:22.823 --> 12:25.245
LET'S JUST SAY YOU MAY
HAVE A SURPRISE IN STORE
COME DANCE NIGHT.

12:25.245 --> 12:27.747
I'VE SAID TOO MUCH.

12:27.747 --> 12:30.921
I WAS JUST THINKING THAT
ABOUT TWO SECONDS AFTER
YOU SAT DOWN.

12:30.921 --> 12:32.923
NOW THAT WE'RE FRIENDS,

12:32.923 --> 12:35.375
MAYBE YOU CAN TELL SOME PEOPLE
HOW NICE AND CHILL I AM.

12:35.375 --> 12:37.337
OH, AND TELL PEOPLE I'M
GOING TO THE DANCE WITH AVERY.

12:37.337 --> 12:39.339
THAT'LL HELP
MY POPULARITY, TOO.

12:39.339 --> 12:42.222
POUND IT OUT...
AMONGST YOURSELVES.
I DON'T TOUCH.

12:45.806 --> 12:47.227
Stan:
OKAY, YOU READY?

12:47.227 --> 12:48.979
I'M READY. WHAT DO
YOU GUYS WANNA SHOW ME?

12:53.063 --> 12:56.396
SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF OUR DEEJAY COSTUMES?

12:56.396 --> 12:57.988
YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU'RE FIGHTING CRIME

12:57.988 --> 12:59.449
IN A 1970's
ROLLER RINK.

12:59.449 --> 13:01.611
NAILED IT!

13:01.611 --> 13:03.994
TOUGH AND GROOVY.
THAT'S WHAT I WAS GOING FOR.

13:03.994 --> 13:06.286
WHY DO YOU THINK I HAD IT
SEWN ON TO OUR BUTTS?

13:09.619 --> 13:11.671
WHY DOES MY BUTT
HAVE TO BE GROOVY?

13:11.671 --> 13:14.714
BECAUSE MY BUTT IS TOUGH.

13:14.714 --> 13:16.837
STAN, COME UP WITH
SOMETHING ELSE.

13:16.837 --> 13:18.548
ALL RIGHT,
WE CAN SWITCH,

13:18.548 --> 13:20.220
BUT I DON'T THINK
YOU'LL FIT IN MY PANTS.

13:20.220 --> 13:23.683
MY BUTT IS
ALSO TINY!

13:23.683 --> 13:25.345
WHY DID I SIGN
THOSE PAPERS?

13:26.636 --> 13:28.428
STAN, I'M SO NERVOUS.

13:28.428 --> 13:29.890
IF TOMORROW'S DANCE
DOESN'T GO WELL,

13:29.890 --> 13:32.062
WES AND I WILL NEVER
END UP TOGETHER.

13:32.062 --> 13:34.104
I'LL GROW OLD AND LONELY.

13:34.104 --> 13:35.856
A DESPERATE LIBRARIAN WITH
ONE OF THOSE PIXIE HAIRCUTS

13:35.856 --> 13:38.358
THAT JUST PUSHES
MEN AWAY.

13:38.358 --> 13:40.901
AS ONE HALF OF
A VERY POPULAR DEEJAY DUO,

13:40.901 --> 13:42.903
I HAVE TO SAY,

13:42.903 --> 13:45.035
DANCE LIKE
NO ONE'S WATCHING,

13:45.035 --> 13:47.077
SING LIKE
NO ONE'S LISTENING,

13:47.077 --> 13:50.000
AND REPEAT CLICHES
LIKE NO ONE'S ORIGINAL.

13:51.251 --> 13:53.543
KNOCKETY-KNOCKETY.

13:53.543 --> 13:55.876
OH, LOOK, YOUR DOG
IS WEARING AN EXACT REPLICA

13:55.876 --> 13:57.757
OF MOTHER'S OLD
ROLLER DERBY COSTUME.

13:57.757 --> 13:59.629
SHE WAS KNOWN AS
QUEEN KONG,

13:59.629 --> 14:01.671
DUE BOTH TO HER
MUSCULAR BULK,

14:01.671 --> 14:04.304
AND THE FACT THAT
SHE ONCE SCALED
A SKYSCRAPER.

14:04.304 --> 14:06.846
IT'S NOT WEIRD.

14:06.846 --> 14:09.309
I'M PRETTY SURE IF YOU
IMAGE-SEARCHED "WEIRD,"

14:09.309 --> 14:11.811
A PICTURE OF THAT
WOULD COME UP.

14:11.811 --> 14:13.143
TOOTS.

14:14.774 --> 14:16.977
NOW CAN WE PLEASE
GET STARTED ON MY LESSON?

14:16.977 --> 14:18.899
THE DANCE IS
TOMORROW NIGHT,
AND I'M SO NERVOUS.

14:18.899 --> 14:23.693
OH, AVERY, YOU HAVE
EVERY REASON TO BE.

14:24.784 --> 14:26.406
LET'S SEE YOUR PROGRESS.

14:26.406 --> 14:28.748
( dance music plays )

14:44.714 --> 14:46.636
WELL, I DIDN'T
AVERT MY EYES

14:46.636 --> 14:48.929
AND EXPERIENCE
A SENSATION OF NAUSEA.

14:48.929 --> 14:52.012
THERE'S A THRESHOLD
I DIDN'T THINK WE'D CROSS.

14:52.012 --> 14:55.725
NOW THE ONE SUBJECT
WE HAVEN'T COVERED YET
IS SLOW DANCING.

14:55.725 --> 14:57.607
( both shudder )

14:59.109 --> 15:01.901
( slow music plays )

15:06.236 --> 15:08.368
THAT KARL GUY SAID HE'S
GOING TO THE DANCE WITH AVERY,

15:08.368 --> 15:10.830
AND APPARENTLY,
HE TELLS IT LIKE IT IS.

15:12.702 --> 15:14.584
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON.

15:14.584 --> 15:16.796
I'M JUST GONNA TALK TO HER
AND CLEAR THE AIR.

15:20.670 --> 15:23.673
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T THINK I NEED TO.

15:30.680 --> 15:32.812
BENNETT, THANK YOU
FOR BEING SO PATIENT

15:32.812 --> 15:34.814
WAITING FOR ME TO WATCH
UPTON CARRIAGE HOUSE.

15:34.814 --> 15:36.606
I PROMISE TONIGHT,
I WILL STAY AWAKE.

15:36.606 --> 15:38.728
PREDICTION: DEREK
THE STABLE BOY

15:38.728 --> 15:40.020
IS GONNA MARRY
LADY ELIZABETH.

15:41.231 --> 15:42.902
COULD HAPPEN.

15:42.902 --> 15:45.275
YOU WATCHED WITHOUT ME?!

15:45.275 --> 15:46.326
WHAT GAVE ME AWAY?

15:46.326 --> 15:48.068
"COULD HAPPEN."

15:49.069 --> 15:50.240
HOW COULD YOU WATCH AHEAD?

15:50.240 --> 15:52.572
I CAN CATCH YOU UP

15:52.572 --> 15:55.625
ON EVERYTHING YOU MISSED
IN THE FIRST FOUR EPISODES.
EVERYONE DIES.

15:55.625 --> 15:57.957
EVERYONE DIES?
OF WHAT?

15:57.957 --> 16:00.460
CONSUMPTION, DROPSY,
SHIPWRECKS, BAD GOOSE,

16:00.460 --> 16:02.672
DIRIGIBLE MISHAPS,
SCURVY, STAIRS, WAR.

16:02.672 --> 16:06.756
OH, AND THE SWITCHOVER
FROM HORSES TO CARS
IS JUST A BLOODBATH.

16:07.847 --> 16:09.759
SPEAKING OF BLOODBATHS,
BENNETT,

16:09.759 --> 16:11.091
HOW ARE YOU GONNA
MAKE THIS UP TO ME?

16:11.091 --> 16:12.892
TELL YOU WHAT.

16:12.892 --> 16:14.594
WHY DON'T YOU WATCH THE FIRST
FOUR EPISODES TOMORROW,

16:14.594 --> 16:16.556
AND I WILL DO
ALL OF YOUR HOUSEWORK.

16:16.556 --> 16:18.768
HUH? THAT WAY, YOU CAN
BE ALL CAUGHT UP,

16:18.768 --> 16:20.480
AND YOU WON'T BE TIRED.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.522
AND THEN, WE CAN WATCH
EPISODE FIVE TOGETHER.

16:22.522 --> 16:24.984
REALLY? YOU WOULD
DO THAT FOR ME?

16:24.984 --> 16:26.986
THAT DOES MAKE UP FOR A LOT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH, HONEY.

16:26.986 --> 16:29.069
YOU'RE WELCOME.

16:29.069 --> 16:32.452
SO EXACTLY WHAT DO YOU
DO AROUND HERE?

16:32.452 --> 16:35.075
I'M READY TO GO
TO SLEEP WITH YOU.

16:35.075 --> 16:36.956
SWEETIE, WE HAVE TO TALK.

16:36.956 --> 16:38.668
YOU'RE GETTING TO BE
A BIG GIRL.

16:38.668 --> 16:41.501
THIS ISN'T ABOUT
GETTING A BRA, IS IT?

16:41.501 --> 16:44.124
NO, WE'RE A FEW YEARS
AWAY ON THAT ONE.

16:44.124 --> 16:46.676
WHAT MOMMY IS SAYING
IS THAT IT'S TIME FOR YOU

16:46.676 --> 16:48.928
TO GO TO SLEEP
LIKE A BIG GIRL--

16:48.928 --> 16:51.681
WITHOUT MOMMY OR DADDY
AND WITHOUT CHARLIE POTATOES.

16:51.681 --> 16:53.893
BUT LAST NIGHT WAS
FUN ON THE COUCH,

16:53.893 --> 16:55.765
EXCEPT FOR WHEN
DADDY STARTED CRYING.

16:55.765 --> 16:58.558
WHO'S DEREK, AND WHY DID HE
HAVE SO MUCH TO LIVE FOR?

16:58.558 --> 17:01.481
YOU'LL GET
THROUGH THIS, CHLOE.

17:01.481 --> 17:03.353
WHEN YOU FACE
NEW CHALLENGES,

17:03.353 --> 17:05.405
THAT'S HOW YOU GROW
AND GET STRONGER.

17:05.405 --> 17:07.487
NOW IT'S NEW CHALLENGES
THAT MAKE ME GROW

17:07.487 --> 17:08.818
AND GET STRONGER?

17:08.818 --> 17:10.650
YESTERDAY,
IT WAS VEGETABLES.

17:10.650 --> 17:12.742
YOU CAN'T SAY THAT
FOR EVERYTHING.

17:15.915 --> 17:17.657
HEY, IS WES HERE?

17:17.657 --> 17:18.708
NO, BUT KARL FINK IS.

17:18.708 --> 17:20.330
HE WANTS US TO ENTER THE DANCE

17:20.330 --> 17:22.622
ENCIRCLING HIM
AND GIGGLING GIRLISHLY.

17:22.622 --> 17:24.924
I DON'T GIGGLE.
I HAVE A HEARTY DEEP LAUGH.

17:24.924 --> 17:26.756
I DON'T USE IT,
BUT I HAVE IT.

17:26.756 --> 17:29.008
BE NICE TO KARL.

17:29.008 --> 17:30.800
HE'S THE REASON THAT,
TONIGHT,

17:30.800 --> 17:32.672
I'M GONNA BE DANCING
WITH THE BOY OF MY DREAMS.

17:34.934 --> 17:36.346
IT HAPPENED, MOTHER.

17:36.346 --> 17:38.228
AVERY CALLED ME
THE BOY OF HER DREAMS.

17:38.228 --> 17:39.769
THE CONVIVIALITY OF
OUR DANCE LESSONS

17:39.769 --> 17:41.681
HAS CAUSED HER TO FALL
HOPELESSLY IN LOVE WITH ME,

17:41.681 --> 17:43.563
JUST AS YOU PREDICTED.

17:43.563 --> 17:46.065
WELL, WE GOTTA GET
DOWN TO THE DANCE.
WE'RE MISSING STUFF.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.817
LOOK AT THIS PICTURE
ON BUDDY BOP.

17:47.817 --> 17:50.190
PETER MURPHY
AND HIS CARTWHEELS.

17:50.190 --> 17:53.032
I DID NOT MAKE A MISTAKE.

17:53.032 --> 17:56.826
WAIT A MINUTE, IS THAT WES?
WHY IS HE ALREADY THERE?

17:56.826 --> 17:58.748
HE PROBABLY JUST THOUGHT
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO MEET THERE.

17:58.748 --> 18:00.370
YEAH. COME ON,
LET'S GO.

18:00.370 --> 18:02.622
ALL RIGHT, MOTHER,
WE'RE LEAVING NOW.

18:02.622 --> 18:04.664
DON'T WORRY,
I'LL LET HER DOWN EASY,

18:04.664 --> 18:06.336
MUCH AS YOU DID
THAT FERRIS WHEEL YOU CAUGHT

18:06.336 --> 18:08.668
WHEN IT BROKE FREE
FROM ITS BASE.

18:18.718 --> 18:20.640
WE ARE KILLIN' IT.

18:20.640 --> 18:22.021
YEAH, WE'RE AWESOME.

18:22.021 --> 18:24.144
ACTUALLY, YOU'RE AWESOME.
I'M COOL.

18:25.895 --> 18:29.149
COULDN'T FIT "AWESOME"
ON MY BUTT. TINY!

18:29.149 --> 18:31.030
THERE HE IS.

18:34.284 --> 18:36.075
WHY DIDN'T HE WAVE BACK?

18:36.075 --> 18:37.327
DIDN'T HE SEE ME?

18:37.327 --> 18:39.038
AVERY!

18:39.038 --> 18:41.411
YOU MUSTN'T FALL FOR ME.

18:41.411 --> 18:43.623
OKAY.

18:43.623 --> 18:45.745
THAT'S RIGHT, GIRL.

18:45.745 --> 18:47.797
WALK AWAY BRAVELY.

18:47.797 --> 18:51.671
- HEY, WES.
- AVERY.

18:51.671 --> 18:53.843
UM, I GUESS MAYBE
YOU THOUGHT WE WERE
SUPPOSED TO MEET HERE,

18:53.843 --> 18:55.635
AND NOT AT MY HOUSE.

18:55.635 --> 18:58.057
OR MAYBE I DECIDED
TO GO WITH SOMEONE ELSE

18:58.057 --> 18:59.759
AND DIDN'T EVEN TELL YOU,

18:59.759 --> 19:01.721
SO WHEN YOU FINALLY
FOUND OUT, IT WOULD
HURT MORE.

19:01.721 --> 19:03.142
WES...

19:03.142 --> 19:05.104
HOW WOULD THAT FEEL, AVERY?

19:05.104 --> 19:06.436
BAD, WOULDN'T IT?

19:12.151 --> 19:14.774
HARD, MOTHER.
SHE'S TAKING IT HARD.

19:14.774 --> 19:16.736
WHAT DID YOU
DO TO AVERY?

19:16.736 --> 19:19.739
I'VE BEEN TO DETENTION.
I'M NOT AFRAID TO GO BACK.

19:23.743 --> 19:25.785
THIS IS THE WORST
NIGHT OF MY LIFE.

19:25.785 --> 19:28.838
BRA STUFF, HUH?

19:28.838 --> 19:31.551
LIFE WAS SO MUCH EASIER
BEFORE I LIKED BOYS.

19:31.551 --> 19:35.505
IT WAS SO MUCH EASIER
BEFORE I LOST CHARLIE POTATOES.

19:35.505 --> 19:37.797
I FEEL LIKE I JUST
GOT MY HEART RIPPED OUT.

19:37.797 --> 19:41.761
CHARLIE POTATOES DID GET
HIS HEART RIPPED OUT.

19:41.761 --> 19:43.643
I JUST THOUGHT WES
WAS SO PERFECT.

19:43.643 --> 19:45.725
I CAN'T BELIEVE
HE'S SUCH A JERK.

19:45.725 --> 19:47.227
I NEVER WANNA
SEE HIM AGAIN.

19:47.227 --> 19:49.309
- ( doorbell rings )
- IS THAT WES?

19:50.610 --> 19:52.312
IT'S PROBABLY
NOT EVEN WES.

19:52.312 --> 19:53.773
I'M CRAZY.

19:53.773 --> 19:55.655
( gasps )
IT'S WES.

19:55.655 --> 19:57.657
WAIT, HE'S SUCH A JERK.
WHAT AM I DOING?

20:01.451 --> 20:02.782
I'M SUCH A JERK.

20:02.782 --> 20:05.285
HEY, AVERY, THAT'S WHAT
YOU JUST CALLED HIM.

20:05.285 --> 20:08.748
CHLOE, WHY DON'T YOU
GO UPSTAIRS AND PLAY
IN YOUR ROOM?

20:08.748 --> 20:12.292
UPSET MY SISTER AGAIN,
AND YOU'LL BE SLEEPING
WITH CHARLIE POTATOES.

20:17.006 --> 20:18.968
I'M SO SORRY.

20:18.968 --> 20:20.970
I THOUGHT YOU BLEW ME OFF
AND WENT TO THE DANCE
WITH KARL.

20:20.970 --> 20:23.393
IS THAT WHY YOU BLEW ME OFF
AND WENT WITH ANOTHER GIRL?

20:23.393 --> 20:24.724
I DIDN'T GO WITH
ANOTHER GIRL.

20:24.724 --> 20:25.935
I DIDN'T GO WITH KARL.

20:25.935 --> 20:28.147
I KNOW THAT NOW.
YOUR FRIENDS TOLD ME.

20:28.147 --> 20:32.151
WELL, LINDSAY TOLD ME.
MAX JUST STOOD THERE GROWLING.

20:32.151 --> 20:34.404
WHY DIDN'T WE JUST
TALK TO EACH OTHER?

20:34.404 --> 20:37.196
I HAVE ABSOLUTELY
NO IDEA.

20:37.196 --> 20:38.908
I REALLY LIKE YOU, AVERY.

20:38.908 --> 20:42.031
I REALLY LIKE YOU, TOO.

20:42.031 --> 20:44.324
SO WHY DOES THIS ALL
HAVE TO BE SO CONFUSING?

20:44.324 --> 20:48.288
- I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA.
- CAN WE JUST START OVER?

20:48.288 --> 20:52.332
AVERY, WOULD YOU LIKE
TO GO TO THE DANCE WITH ME?

21:04.644 --> 21:06.225
MAX?

21:06.225 --> 21:08.097
IT'S NOT WEIRD.

21:09.849 --> 21:12.652
SEEING AVERY SO HAPPY
JUST MAKES ME WANNA CRY.

21:12.652 --> 21:14.694
( sobbing )

21:16.486 --> 21:19.819
UM, 'CAUSE THAT'S HOW
A BROTHER FEELS.

21:19.819 --> 21:21.901
UH, FAST SONG.

21:36.295 --> 21:38.378
I AM EXHAUSTED.

21:38.378 --> 21:40.179
AFTER DOING YOUR
HOUSEWORK ALL DAY,

21:40.179 --> 21:42.842
I FINALLY UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU'RE ALWAYS SO TIRED,

21:42.842 --> 21:44.974
AND WHY YOUR HANDS
ARE SO DRY.

21:46.686 --> 21:48.848
I DID EVERYTHING TODAY.
WHY ARE YOU TIRED?

21:48.848 --> 21:50.229
BECAUSE AFTER YOU
DID EVERYTHING,

21:50.229 --> 21:52.812
I HAD TO GO BACK
AND DO IT THE RIGHT WAY.

21:52.812 --> 21:55.775
BUT WE ARE GONNA GET THROUGH
THIS EPISODE TONIGHT.

21:55.775 --> 21:57.817
YES, WE ARE.

22:04.994 --> 22:06.786
FINALLY, I CAN BLOG.

22:08.708 --> 22:10.910
I WAS REALLY PROUD OF AVERY

22:10.910 --> 22:13.503
FOR GROWING UP A LITTLE BIT
THIS WEEK.

22:13.503 --> 22:15.084
AND CHLOE, TOO.

22:15.084 --> 22:16.956
SHE EVEN FOUND SOMETHING ELSE
TO HELP HER FALL ASLEEP.

22:19.258 --> 22:20.630
AND THE BEST PART IS,

22:20.630 --> 22:23.383
SHE'S LETTING ME
BORROW HER PAJAMAS.

22:25.515 --> 22:28.518
OH, ROBERT,
YOU'RE BACK EARLY.

22:28.518 --> 22:32.562
OKAY, A WEEK IN TEXAS
DOES NOT MAKE YOU A COWBOY.
