bonzer! Look what we have here.

00:03.204 --> 00:06.338
It's the
healthtron 2000xl!

00:06.340 --> 00:10.875
Two thousand times the power
of the healthtron 1.0!

00:10.911 --> 00:13.178
This bad
boy does it all.

00:13.180 --> 00:14.780
If you drop your
keys in there,

00:14.849 --> 00:16.849
Kiss them g'day, mate.

00:16.851 --> 00:20.586
But we're going to find out
if it's good enough at making...

00:20.721 --> 00:23.121
- Ultimate thick milkshakes.
- (crowd cheering)

00:23.190 --> 00:24.923
Let's get started!

00:24.925 --> 00:26.425
Banana. Milk.

00:26.560 --> 00:28.894
Choco syrup. Choco chips.

00:28.896 --> 00:30.729
What brings this boy
to the yard?

00:30.864 --> 00:32.664
Triple-churn ice cream,

00:32.666 --> 00:34.132
- That's what.
- Cartoon voice: Yummy!

00:34.168 --> 00:35.867
Let's give it a go.

00:35.936 --> 00:37.603
(record scratching,
booming)

00:37.605 --> 00:39.671
It's real loud!

00:39.673 --> 00:41.340
That's the sound
of health!

00:44.779 --> 00:49.147
Are you using my setup to
film fake infomercials again?

00:49.183 --> 00:51.550
You know the rules.

00:51.619 --> 00:52.884
(in australian accent)
add brownies

00:52.953 --> 00:57.556
For a delish bulking agent!

00:57.625 --> 01:00.092
Crikey!
That's bonzer!

01:00.227 --> 01:02.694
Ripper! Just
one more test.

01:02.730 --> 01:06.331
We need to see if its thick
enough for the ultimate flip.

01:06.333 --> 01:10.235
♪

01:10.237 --> 01:12.037
(in normal voice) oh, get
the spoons! Get the spoons!

01:12.106 --> 01:13.372
Andrew: (in normal voice) not
enough bulking agents!

01:13.374 --> 01:14.506
Camille:
Too much milk!

01:18.779 --> 01:20.445
How could they do
that, dad?

01:20.448 --> 01:22.380
What the f?
It's an outrage.

01:22.450 --> 01:24.583
Can you get over that
spider-man already?

01:24.585 --> 01:26.485
They did auntie may dirty.
I'll never forgive.

01:26.620 --> 01:29.121
- But it's not that.
- Culturefest got cancelled!

01:29.256 --> 01:30.989
What? Why?

01:30.991 --> 01:32.591
Probably because
bob hates me.

01:32.660 --> 01:34.526
This year, it just
happens to land on tet,

01:34.595 --> 01:36.794
And he cancels?
Convenient.

01:36.831 --> 01:40.132
I've been working my butt off on
my presentation about vietnam.

01:40.134 --> 01:41.867
I wanted ong
noi to see it!

01:41.936 --> 01:43.435
Bummer. I was going
to bless the community

01:43.504 --> 01:44.970
With my chicken curry.

01:45.105 --> 01:49.474
Dad, can't you do something
about it? Please?

01:49.510 --> 01:52.077
Oh, buddy, you
don't got to milk

01:52.212 --> 01:54.613
The last drops of your
baby face cuteness for me.

01:54.615 --> 01:57.549
I'm on it. Someone's getting
a phone call

01:57.684 --> 01:59.417
During office
hours tomorrow!

02:01.956 --> 02:03.488
I'm talking about bob.

02:03.491 --> 02:04.956
Nobody was confused.

02:09.497 --> 02:11.429
Man on phone: You've reached
robert "bob" boberts,

02:11.465 --> 02:13.031
Community development

02:13.033 --> 02:14.566
Please leave a

02:14.701 --> 02:16.034
Thank you. Beep!

Oh! Hi, bob.

02:18.005 --> 02:19.371
It's andrew pham.

02:19.506 --> 02:21.439
You remember me?

02:21.475 --> 02:22.841
You cancelling
culturefest

02:22.976 --> 02:25.043
Is like you cancelling
cultural christmas,

02:25.045 --> 02:27.646
Which makes you
a culture grinch.

02:27.648 --> 02:28.947
Culture grinch.

02:29.016 --> 02:30.582
Oh, that is rich.

02:30.717 --> 02:32.284
You faked your voicemail?

02:32.419 --> 02:33.652
Bob:
It's my vetting system.

02:33.654 --> 02:35.520
Why'd you cancel
culturefest?

02:35.556 --> 02:37.055
On lunar new
year, no less?

02:37.057 --> 02:39.123
I reallocated the funds
into a donor dinner

02:39.160 --> 02:40.459
For the country club.

02:40.461 --> 02:41.727
We had donairs.

02:41.862 --> 02:43.662
You had a donair
donor dinner?

02:43.731 --> 02:45.263
Mm-hmm. Clever, right?

02:45.332 --> 02:47.299
Culturefest
is important!

02:47.301 --> 02:50.269
Representation matters
in our community.

02:50.404 --> 02:53.305
It brings people together...
In togetherness!

02:53.374 --> 02:56.141
Look. I've been doing
culturefest for 20 years.

02:56.143 --> 02:58.610
If people are not
cultured enough by now,

02:58.679 --> 03:01.512
That is on them!

03:01.549 --> 03:03.382
- I can't believe that guy.
- You know, this is

03:03.384 --> 03:05.116
- Right in your ballpark.
- What? Fighting

03:05.152 --> 03:06.752
With crusty
municipal officials?

03:06.887 --> 03:10.155
No, man. No one can pull
together people in togetherness

03:10.290 --> 03:11.656
Like you!

03:11.692 --> 03:13.358
You should run culturefest.

03:13.427 --> 03:15.227
(sighing) I would do
a better job than bob.

03:15.362 --> 03:17.095
We need you, man.

03:17.231 --> 03:19.097
Have you read the neighbourhood
group chats lately?

03:19.099 --> 03:20.432
Oh, I had to
put it on mute

03:20.501 --> 03:22.100
To avoid spoilers to
celebrity cobbler.

03:22.169 --> 03:24.636
Everyone's sad that
culturefest is cancelled.

03:24.672 --> 03:26.271
Is it even a year if
it doesn't happen?

03:27.575 --> 03:28.773
You know what?

03:30.911 --> 03:32.177
I can do it.

03:32.179 --> 03:33.911
I could totally pull
this off.

03:33.948 --> 03:36.648
That's the positive affirmations
I'm talking about, man.

03:40.454 --> 03:41.886
Stephanie, are you
kidding me?

03:41.922 --> 03:44.723
Of course. Alright.
I appreciate this deal.

03:44.725 --> 03:47.025
Thank you so much.
Alright. Bye.

03:47.094 --> 03:49.761
Just locked in
the legion-- for free.

03:49.896 --> 03:51.663
Me and hudson will have to do
their books for a year,

03:51.798 --> 03:53.865
But that's the
barter life, baby!

03:53.934 --> 03:56.534
That's huge. And sebastian
confirmed he will donate

03:56.570 --> 03:58.803
Tables, chairs, and two
pallets of dish soap?

03:58.872 --> 04:00.539
Are you sure he
actually has them?

04:00.674 --> 04:02.540
I asked him to send photos.
Looked like he was in a bunker.

04:02.610 --> 04:04.710
- I did not ask questions.
- Yeah.

04:04.845 --> 04:06.044
How's the event
post doing, khia?

04:06.080 --> 04:07.812
Great. A lot of
people want booths.

04:07.881 --> 04:09.681
Ah, it's all
coming together.

04:09.717 --> 04:11.617
I'm proud of me. No!

04:11.752 --> 04:14.052
I'm proud of us.

04:14.121 --> 04:16.321
Okay. How about
this as the theme?

04:17.491 --> 04:19.091
Togetherness.

04:19.093 --> 04:20.358
- Camille: It's okay.
- Khia: Kind of corny.

04:20.394 --> 04:21.359
I like it.

04:21.495 --> 04:22.560
Camille:
Mm.

04:22.630 --> 04:27.632
(man singing in
foreign language)

04:27.635 --> 04:28.900
Together in
togetherness!

04:29.036 --> 04:29.968
(camera snapping)

04:30.103 --> 04:31.269
Woman:
Andrew!

04:36.577 --> 04:39.043
- Ba, you look so good.
- Rock and roll.

04:39.079 --> 04:40.578
Ma, did you bring any
spring rolls?

04:40.648 --> 04:43.014
There's two coolers
full in the car.

04:43.083 --> 04:46.184
But those are for our
tet celebration at home later.

04:46.253 --> 04:47.853
I made cà ri gà
for my booth.

04:47.988 --> 04:50.255
Actually, some others
also made curry chicken.

04:50.324 --> 04:51.857
Vietnamese style?

04:51.992 --> 04:53.925
You know what, ma?
You do you.

04:53.927 --> 04:55.694
I was going to.

04:55.763 --> 04:59.131
Where's leo? I promised
I'd helped him with his phrases.

04:59.133 --> 05:00.932
Oh, uh, he's around.

05:00.934 --> 05:03.535
Ba, no swear words.

05:03.537 --> 05:06.104
(snapping)

05:06.239 --> 05:08.139
Okay. What are you doing?
Why are you being so weird?

05:08.208 --> 05:13.211
♪

05:13.280 --> 05:16.081
I found a receipt for a
horse carriage ride.

05:16.150 --> 05:18.083
Super problematic
for horses.

05:18.152 --> 05:21.386
- Okay.
- But super romantic.

05:21.455 --> 05:23.121
I think nikhil's going
to propose.

05:23.190 --> 05:25.590
What? That's amazing!

05:25.726 --> 05:28.626
No! I was planning to
propose on valentine's day.

05:28.696 --> 05:30.829
Aw! Since when
are you romantic?

05:30.831 --> 05:33.131
- Since I fell in love, stupid.
- You're stupid.

05:33.167 --> 05:34.499
You're stupid.
Stop it.

05:34.568 --> 05:35.834
I can't let
him beat me to it.

05:35.903 --> 05:37.969
Why are you two so
competitive?

05:38.105 --> 05:40.171
I'm still traumatized
from our last games night.

05:40.207 --> 05:41.540
Because it's our
thing and it's hot.

05:41.542 --> 05:42.841
Okay. I love love, but
that's gross.

05:42.843 --> 05:44.409
- You're gross.
- You're gross.

05:44.411 --> 05:46.978
Stop. Just find out when
he's planning on asking me,

05:47.014 --> 05:48.713
And then I
can ask him first.

05:48.716 --> 05:49.981
Yeah. Okay.

05:50.117 --> 05:52.250
- Say it like you mean it!
- Ow! Okay!

05:52.252 --> 05:54.319
So, I saw an open browser
on carol's laptop

05:54.454 --> 05:56.755
For engagement
rings... For men.

05:56.890 --> 05:58.456
- For me.

05:58.492 --> 06:00.458
Oh, my god.
Wow! That's so great!

06:00.594 --> 06:02.194
I didn't know you
two were there yet.

06:02.196 --> 06:04.129
She can't propose
to me. I have to do it.

06:04.198 --> 06:05.564
Isn't that a bit outdated?

06:05.699 --> 06:07.865
Oh, no, no, no.
It's not that. It--

06:07.901 --> 06:10.935
I'm already planning to
propose on valentine's day.

06:11.004 --> 06:13.004
- Oh.
- Yeah. Horse carriage ride,

06:13.006 --> 06:15.340
Flowers, the whole thing.

06:15.475 --> 06:18.109
Right, right, and
you have to beat her to it

06:18.178 --> 06:19.411
So she doesn't
steal your thunder.

06:19.413 --> 06:20.812
- Exactly.
- Hmm.

06:20.947 --> 06:23.548
Yeah. Carol's competitive
about everything,

06:23.584 --> 06:25.183
Especially sex.

06:25.252 --> 06:28.687
That's a team sport,
but, uh I see you.

06:28.689 --> 06:30.388
It's the principle
of it, right?

06:30.523 --> 06:31.823
- Yeah.
- I'll find out

06:31.859 --> 06:33.091
When she's
planning to do it.

06:33.093 --> 06:34.892
Ah. You're the best.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.299
Both:
Shh! Shh! Shh!

06:41.435 --> 06:44.936
Omg. They both want to
propose on valentine's day?

06:45.071 --> 06:47.772
- It's so cliché and exciting!
- (camille squealing)

06:47.775 --> 06:49.874
Does this mean we'll
be more related?

06:49.910 --> 06:53.311
Probably, but not
in a gross way.

06:53.313 --> 06:54.512
(in raspy voice)
family.

06:54.581 --> 06:56.080
Yeah! (squealing)

06:56.116 --> 06:57.282
- Chill.
- Be cool. Be cool. Be cool.

06:57.417 --> 06:58.316
Be cool.

06:58.385 --> 07:01.319

07:01.321 --> 07:02.387
Ow!

07:02.389 --> 07:05.089
(music continuing to play)

07:05.159 --> 07:07.258
Oh, those are
some lovely aromatics.

07:07.294 --> 07:08.627
Oh. Thank you.

07:08.629 --> 07:10.328
And, uh, what do
you got over there?

07:10.330 --> 07:12.631
Oh, I got some,
uh, curry chicken.

07:12.633 --> 07:13.799
Oh.

07:18.138 --> 07:20.905
- Is that chicken curry, linh?
- Yes.

07:20.974 --> 07:22.307
There's a vietnamese
curry chicken?

07:22.442 --> 07:25.543
- The best kind.
- Hmm. Looks like we all brought

07:25.579 --> 07:27.312
Chicken curry.

07:27.447 --> 07:30.348
Oh, but no, no, no, no, no, no.
I brought curry chicken.

07:30.417 --> 07:31.550
That's the way you're
supposed to say it.

07:31.685 --> 07:32.884
Is that right?

07:32.920 --> 07:34.252
Mm-hmm, and it's not
just a dish.

07:34.387 --> 07:35.987
(in jamaican accent)
it's a lifestyle.

07:35.989 --> 07:37.455
(in normal voice) no.
Seriously, it takes a long time

07:37.491 --> 07:39.257
To marinate the meat.
Next-level stuff, so...

07:39.259 --> 07:42.460
(chuckling) you're saying
that to an indian woman. Yeah.

07:42.463 --> 07:44.896
I got the og
chicken curry.

07:44.965 --> 07:47.432
So many spices blended
together perfectly,

07:47.434 --> 07:49.166
It'll make
your taste buds spin.

07:49.203 --> 07:51.903
(stammering) oh,
might be og,

07:51.939 --> 07:53.504
But we perfected
it, so...

07:53.540 --> 07:55.373
Please, don't fight.

07:55.375 --> 07:57.442
They both look and
smell terrible.

07:57.577 --> 07:59.343
Mine's better.

07:59.379 --> 08:00.645
Well, it looks like
we have ourselves

08:00.647 --> 08:01.846
A chicken curry
competition.

08:01.882 --> 08:03.982
No, a curry chicken
competition.

08:03.984 --> 08:06.450
You two don't
stand a chance.

08:09.289 --> 08:11.056
- (unclear), move.
- (hudson panting)

08:11.058 --> 08:12.724
Why?

08:12.726 --> 08:15.192
Whoa! Smells
amazing.

08:18.631 --> 08:20.632
- What's going on?
- It's a chicken curry showdown!

08:20.701 --> 08:23.668
- Curry chicken!
- Son, I'm about to destroy

08:23.704 --> 08:26.137
- Your wife and best friend.
- Why so violent?

08:26.273 --> 08:27.472
Did you know they
were making the same thing?

08:27.607 --> 08:29.140
I didn't think
it'd be a problem.

08:29.176 --> 08:30.408
It's not, because my
curry's going to put theirs

08:30.544 --> 08:31.643
- To shame.
- Oh, yeah? Try me.

08:31.778 --> 08:33.511
Hudson:
Yeah. You're going down.

08:33.514 --> 08:34.880
- Camille: You're going down.
- You're going down down.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.547
Camille: No. You're
going to go way down.

08:36.583 --> 08:38.215
- Babe, togetherness.
- Hudson: You're going so down.

08:38.252 --> 08:39.751
Yeah. These meat and potatoes
together in this pot.

08:39.753 --> 08:41.052
Well, the spices
together in this pot.

08:44.057 --> 08:45.823
Hey, everyone.

08:45.859 --> 08:49.694
I just want to thank you so
much for all of your hard work.

08:49.696 --> 08:50.996
By the end of this,

08:51.131 --> 08:53.865
We are going to feel
more together than ever,

08:53.934 --> 08:57.736
And that is
the pham guarantee.

08:57.738 --> 09:01.372
(music playing,
cheering)

09:01.408 --> 09:03.275
Okay. Time for the magic.

09:03.410 --> 09:06.010
Doors to culturefest

09:21.862 --> 09:25.063
Bob. I thought you washed your
hands of culturefest.

09:25.132 --> 09:26.765
I never wash my hands.

09:26.900 --> 09:29.467
Just came by to see your work.

09:29.536 --> 09:31.269
You need permits for
all of this.

09:31.404 --> 09:34.139
- Oh, do I?
- Mm-hmm.

09:34.141 --> 09:38.075
Got them!
Respect to barb.

09:38.111 --> 09:40.544
It's my classic
culturefest configuration.

09:40.581 --> 09:42.981
I see my influence
weighs heavy around here.

09:43.116 --> 09:44.849
Yeah. That's just what you do
with tables and chairs.

09:44.885 --> 09:47.819
Well, ip infringement aside,

09:47.888 --> 09:50.021
I don't see a
lot of togetherness.

09:50.090 --> 09:53.525
Mostly just conflicting
curry smells.

09:53.660 --> 09:57.562
The togetherness is going to
be coming... Together.

09:57.697 --> 09:59.764
- Bob: Mm.
- Why don't you just, uh,

09:59.766 --> 10:01.232
Enjoy yourself, bob?

10:01.234 --> 10:02.700
That's what today
is all about.

10:02.769 --> 10:07.505
Oh. I certainly
will... Enjoy myself.

♪

10:14.014 --> 10:16.981
I cannot believe bob had
the nerve to show up.

10:17.017 --> 10:18.316
He just came
to stir up trouble.

10:18.451 --> 10:20.185
Don't let him
get under your skin.

10:20.187 --> 10:22.187
Speaking of stirring,
can you help out?

10:22.322 --> 10:23.855
Nikhil's
too distracted!

10:23.857 --> 10:25.657
Babe, no.

10:25.659 --> 10:28.193
Please cool it with the
competitiveness.

10:28.328 --> 10:29.460
Set the example!

10:29.529 --> 10:30.862
The example of failure?

10:30.931 --> 10:32.497
- (andrew sighing)
- sebastian: Hey, buddy.

10:32.499 --> 10:34.598
Some numpty's trying
to hook up their deep fryer

10:34.635 --> 10:36.134
For the curry cook-off,

10:36.203 --> 10:37.669
And I'm no hvac narc,

10:37.671 --> 10:39.671
But I don't think that's
up to code.

10:39.673 --> 10:40.939
Seriously?

10:44.411 --> 10:47.612
I loves a curry
cook-off! (laughing)

10:47.747 --> 10:49.147
(crosstalking indistinctly)

10:49.216 --> 10:51.415

Try mine. It's (unclear).

10:51.451 --> 10:53.150
(crosstalking indistinctly)

10:53.186 --> 10:54.619
You need to have it
with the naan, though.

10:54.754 --> 10:58.556
(speaking vietnamese) this
isn't a curry cook-off!

10:58.625 --> 11:00.425
So, next Saturday,

11:00.494 --> 11:02.026
How about we go
to the observatory

11:02.062 --> 11:03.828
For the meteor shower?

11:03.830 --> 11:05.463
Eh. I was thinking,

11:05.532 --> 11:08.266
Saturday, we would take
a day trip to bimini cliffs.

11:08.335 --> 11:09.533
Where we had our first date?

11:09.569 --> 11:11.702
Oh, did we? Weird.

11:13.840 --> 11:14.973
(whimpering)

11:19.746 --> 11:22.780
Fun fact: The term "curry" was
coined by the british

11:22.816 --> 11:24.982
As a blanket term
for indian cuisine.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.384
Not sure how
that's fun exactly,

11:26.519 --> 11:29.720
But my curry chicken
was voted by my granny

11:29.756 --> 11:32.857
As second
best next to hers!

11:32.893 --> 11:34.525
Oh, and if you
knew granny June,

11:34.561 --> 11:35.927
You know how
impressive that is.

11:35.929 --> 11:37.328
Oh, I do know granny June,

11:37.330 --> 11:39.264
And I'm still not
that impressed.

11:39.266 --> 11:42.333
Well, looks like we've got, uh,
quite the competition.

11:42.335 --> 11:43.902
How you going
to decide who wins?

11:43.904 --> 11:47.005
- I win.
- No. No. We just--

11:47.007 --> 11:48.473
We haven't figured that
part out yet.

11:48.542 --> 11:50.408
Yeah. We're really focused
on the trash talk.

11:50.543 --> 11:53.210
Well, allow me
to be of service.

11:53.246 --> 11:55.012
Camille:
No, no. Uh-uh-uh.

11:55.014 --> 11:56.747
What? You just always have
a spoon on you?

11:56.783 --> 11:59.216
I refuse to lick ice
cream off a cone.

11:59.252 --> 12:01.219
Okay. Well, you
shouldn't even be here,

12:01.288 --> 12:04.021
- So can you please leave?
- Okay. I'll mark you three down

12:04.023 --> 12:05.557
As not participating.

12:05.559 --> 12:07.158
I'm going to go try
the pakistani chicken curry.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

12:10.063 --> 12:13.898
Curry chicken, and bob,
how about you try some of mine?

12:13.900 --> 12:15.233
- Sure.
- Right? Mannix, let's-- let's--

Yeah.

12:16.570 --> 12:17.768

12:21.608 --> 12:24.441
Wow. That has
quite a kick to it.

12:24.478 --> 12:25.910
(chuckling) the
secret ingredient

12:25.912 --> 12:27.444
Is four different peppers.

12:27.481 --> 12:30.915
Well, if you're looking
for flavour and not flames,

12:30.917 --> 12:33.451
You should try mine. (chuckling)

12:33.586 --> 12:35.720
It's got fresh curry leaves,

Overcompensating.

Leo: On wikipedia, it says
he's born in the usa,

14:34.307 --> 14:38.375
But in an interview, he says
he was reborn in vietnam.

14:38.411 --> 14:41.246

about the war.

show him something

That wasn't a white
saviour movie?

14:47.888 --> 14:49.787
- There aren't any.
- Okay.

my boy, leo pham!

18:33.847 --> 18:34.745
Man:
Yeah, leo!

18:34.881 --> 18:38.782
(crowd cheering)

18:38.818 --> 18:40.885
First off, I
just want to say,

18:40.954 --> 18:43.287
Chuck norris
is not vietnamese.

18:43.289 --> 18:44.422
- Whoo!
- Yes.

18:46.626 --> 18:49.627
Though it's hard for
me to talk about vietnam,

18:49.629 --> 18:51.462
It makes me proud these kid

18:51.464 --> 18:53.364
Want to learn about
their culture.

18:53.499 --> 18:56.300
It's a great gift.

18:56.369 --> 18:59.170
My ong noi taught me a song he
used to sing with my dad

18:59.172 --> 19:01.038
When he was little.

19:01.107 --> 19:02.907
Come on. Come.

19:03.042 --> 19:04.308
(shouting in vietnamese)

19:04.310 --> 19:05.943
Okay. (clearing throat)

19:07.380 --> 19:09.179
(speaking vietnamese)

19:09.215 --> 19:14.118
(singing in vietnamese to
the tune of "frère jacques")

19:14.253 --> 19:19.189
(continuing to sing)

19:20.259 --> 19:23.961
(continuing to sing)

19:23.997 --> 19:25.730
(crowd applauding)

19:25.865 --> 19:28.399
Yeah! Rock and roll!

19:28.468 --> 19:31.134
(cheering)

19:34.807 --> 19:37.475
Maybe competing
was silly.

19:37.610 --> 19:39.410
Yeah. Of course we
think ours is the best.

19:39.479 --> 19:41.646
- It connects us to home.
- And we can be proud of that

19:41.781 --> 19:43.714
Without having to take away
from anyone else.

19:43.849 --> 19:46.317
Yeah. Three-way tie?

19:46.452 --> 19:47.284
Yes.

19:47.320 --> 19:49.754
(hudson laughing)

19:49.889 --> 19:52.423
Nah, man. I still need to
know who bob picked.

19:52.425 --> 19:53.857
Where is that
man? Bob?

19:53.927 --> 19:56.360
I'll be right
back, mannix. Bob!

19:56.429 --> 19:58.162
- Hi!
- Hi.

19:58.231 --> 20:01.432
So, I remember how much you
used to like my mom's cooking.

20:01.501 --> 20:02.767
Saved you some.

20:02.769 --> 20:05.436
Thanks. I, uh,
saved you some, too.

20:05.571 --> 20:08.606
Cool. Thanks.

20:08.741 --> 20:13.144
So, do you,
uh, maybe want to--

20:13.279 --> 20:15.579
Khia, come

20:16.916 --> 20:19.182

20:20.753 --> 20:21.985
Bye.

20:23.356 --> 20:24.522
Andrew?

20:24.657 --> 20:26.791
Oh, hey, robin.
Thanks for coming.

20:26.793 --> 20:29.594
- I hope you had a good time.
- Just to be clear,

20:29.729 --> 20:33.130
Bob had absolutely nothing to do
with organizing this, did he?

20:33.266 --> 20:36.834
(sighing) no. No,
he didn't.

20:36.903 --> 20:38.335
Huh.

20:38.371 --> 20:39.537
Man: (distantly)
I hate-- I hate wasting food.

20:39.672 --> 20:43.207
(chattering indistinctly)

20:43.342 --> 20:44.909
Oh, yeah.
Great. Yes.

20:44.911 --> 20:46.410
(stomach gurgling)

20:46.446 --> 20:48.479
Hudson: Bob! You liked my
curry, bob, right? Bob!

20:48.614 --> 20:50.815
Who won, bob? Bob!

20:50.817 --> 20:53.684
I would say that today
was a huge success,

20:53.753 --> 20:56.153
And sorry for going
into beast mode. (chuckling)

20:56.222 --> 20:58.556
It's okay. I just let bob
get under my skin,

20:58.691 --> 21:00.825
But what's important is that
everyone had a good time.

21:00.960 --> 21:02.559
Togetherness.

21:02.629 --> 21:04.061
(gasping)
oh, babe. Look!

21:04.063 --> 21:05.229
Andrew:
Oh, oh, oh.

21:07.967 --> 21:10.634
Both:
Yes! Ah!

21:10.637 --> 21:15.605
(relatives screaming, cheering)

21:18.478 --> 21:20.377
You both won!

21:20.413 --> 21:23.180
Rock and roll!
