WEBVTT

00:33.104 --> 00:36.167
Oh, my god.

00:41.242 --> 00:43.574
(Cell phone rings)

00:46.777 --> 00:50.180
(Ring)

00:50.181 --> 00:51.551
(Instrument clatters)

00:51.552 --> 00:52.822
(Snaps glove)

00:52.823 --> 00:57.127
(Ring)

00:57.128 --> 00:58.628
(Sighs)

00:58.629 --> 00:59.759
Hey, lace.

00:59.760 --> 01:02.162
(Distorted male voice) Dr. Hunt?

01:02.163 --> 01:03.533
Who is this?

01:03.534 --> 01:05.495
You've stuck your nose
where it doesn't belong.

01:05.496 --> 01:07.066
Now I have your daughter,

01:07.067 --> 01:10.501
and you're gonna do exactly
what I say or else she dies.

01:20.811 --> 01:23.613
Did you sign my permission
slip for the field trip this week?

01:23.614 --> 01:24.784
'Cause I can't find it.

01:24.785 --> 01:26.156
It's right here,
in front of you.

01:26.157 --> 01:27.658
Oh. Thanks.

01:29.660 --> 01:31.161
(Chuckles)

01:31.162 --> 01:33.193
Mom? Uh-huh?

01:33.194 --> 01:34.564
You look great. (Shoe thuds)

01:34.565 --> 01:35.625
Huh.

01:35.626 --> 01:37.527
Not nervous at all.

01:37.528 --> 01:38.668
I'm not nervous.

01:38.669 --> 01:40.130
Are you sure you're
ready to go back?

01:40.131 --> 01:41.601
Oh, I am ready.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.233
It's the three months
leave that's been torture.

01:43.234 --> 01:44.734
(Under breath) For
you and me both.

01:44.735 --> 01:46.676
(Sighs) I heard that.

01:46.677 --> 01:48.378
(Curtis) So what kind of
experience do you have?

01:48.379 --> 01:49.779
I worked at a funeral
home in buck's county

01:49.780 --> 01:52.682
and then as an autopsy
assistant at a coroner's office.

01:52.683 --> 01:54.144
So I've seen just
about everything.

01:54.145 --> 01:55.645
That may be so,

01:55.646 --> 01:58.218
but Dr. Hunt is
an acquired taste.

01:58.219 --> 02:00.490
That's right. You
know, she's like grappa.

02:00.491 --> 02:02.121
You know, at first she'll
tear your throat out,

02:02.122 --> 02:04.224
but eventually
you're gonna like it.

02:04.225 --> 02:05.395
Grappa?

02:05.396 --> 02:06.696
I spent the summer in Florence.

02:06.697 --> 02:08.628
Eh, digestivo italiano.

02:08.629 --> 02:09.799
(Speaks Italian)

02:09.800 --> 02:11.601
Stick to the facts,

02:11.602 --> 02:13.633
take lots of pictures,
and don't get discouraged.

02:13.634 --> 02:15.765
It'll take her some
time to warm up to you.

02:15.766 --> 02:17.267
Mm, why?

02:17.268 --> 02:18.768
What happened to the last m.I.?

02:18.769 --> 02:20.310
Really?

02:20.311 --> 02:23.674
Three months ago?
You don't read the paper?

02:30.651 --> 02:31.622
(Bell dings)

02:31.623 --> 02:33.554
(Doors open)

02:34.685 --> 02:37.688
(People speaking indistinctly)

02:42.693 --> 02:44.494
It's Dr. Hunt.

02:44.495 --> 02:45.635
Dr. Hunt!

02:45.636 --> 02:47.667
Wow!

02:47.668 --> 02:48.838
You look great.

02:48.839 --> 02:50.370
I mean, not that you
didn't always look...

02:50.371 --> 02:51.941
But you... you look more great.

02:51.942 --> 02:53.473
(Curtis) It's the haircut.

02:53.474 --> 02:56.446
I swear they took some
of his brain along with it.

02:56.447 --> 02:57.677
I missed you guys.

02:57.678 --> 02:58.649
Really?

02:58.650 --> 02:59.909
No. Who's that?

02:59.910 --> 03:02.552
Charlotte tilney.
She's starting today.

03:02.553 --> 03:03.713
As what?

03:03.714 --> 03:05.455
Uh, medicolegal investigator.

03:05.456 --> 03:06.756
I am so excited
to work with you.

03:06.757 --> 03:08.658
I've read some of your cases.

03:08.659 --> 03:10.560
Like, the one where you
found the guy inside the wall.

03:10.561 --> 03:13.564
I thought that was
really interesting.

03:15.496 --> 03:18.469
(Sighs deeply)

03:23.574 --> 03:24.934
(Peter and Wilson grunting)

03:24.935 --> 03:26.707
(Glass shatters)

03:29.710 --> 03:30.880
(Sighs)

03:30.881 --> 03:32.982
Peter! (Exhales sharply)

03:32.983 --> 03:35.646
Peter. Come on.
It's gonna be okay.

03:42.293 --> 03:44.254
(Knocks on door)

03:44.255 --> 03:45.456
(Sighs)

03:46.697 --> 03:47.897
Welcome back.

03:47.898 --> 03:49.659
What's with the
shrine in the lobby?

03:49.660 --> 03:51.631
Hello to you, too.

03:51.632 --> 03:53.403
Love the new pillows.

03:53.404 --> 03:55.965
Coffee table? Eh, not so much.

03:55.966 --> 03:57.637
Yeah, I...

03:57.638 --> 03:58.908
Wanted to switch
you to a different office,

03:58.909 --> 04:00.870
but Richard advised against it.

04:00.871 --> 04:01.941
Richard?

04:01.942 --> 04:03.473
Yeah, that would
be the grief counselor

04:03.474 --> 04:05.745
I've been asking you to
see for the last three months.

04:05.746 --> 04:07.777
Megan, you've been
through a trauma, okay?

04:07.778 --> 04:10.480
And believe me, I
know what that's like.

04:10.481 --> 04:13.584
You can't just brush this off
like you do everything else.

04:14.725 --> 04:16.726
Bud went to the
grief counselor...

04:16.727 --> 04:18.428
Retired to take
care of his baby.

04:18.429 --> 04:19.729
Sam went to the
grief counselor...

04:19.730 --> 04:21.631
Moved to Virginia
to join the FBI.

04:21.632 --> 04:24.634
I do not want to brush it off.

04:24.635 --> 04:25.865
I wanna get back to work.

04:25.866 --> 04:28.267
And after sitting on my
ass for three months,

04:28.268 --> 04:29.870
I'd like to get started, okay?

04:32.773 --> 04:34.003
Okay.

04:34.004 --> 04:36.946
(Sighs) Hmm.

04:36.947 --> 04:38.678
Transient male found facedown,

04:38.679 --> 04:40.450
coffee ground emesis,

04:40.451 --> 04:41.781
blood and smell of alcohol.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.853
You want me to start
on a dead alcoholic?

04:43.854 --> 04:47.857
I want you to start off slowly
and ease your way back in.

04:47.858 --> 04:50.360
Oh, and you will be working
with a new homicide team.

04:50.361 --> 04:52.993
Please try to start off
on the right foot this time.

04:54.465 --> 04:55.825
(Door opens)

04:55.826 --> 04:57.567
(Door closes)

04:57.568 --> 04:58.868
(Charlotte) After
the coroner's office,

04:58.869 --> 04:59.869
I worked as a lab tech in
the pathology department

04:59.870 --> 05:01.070
of a teaching hospital,

05:01.071 --> 05:02.832
and then as a forensic
autopsy technician.

05:02.833 --> 05:04.634
What did Curtis and
Ethan tell you about me?

05:04.635 --> 05:06.776
That you're a wonderful boss,
totally committed to your job.

05:06.777 --> 05:07.907
You can stop sucking up.

05:07.908 --> 05:10.009
They told me the last
m.I. You worked with

05:10.010 --> 05:11.681
was killed trying
to save your life...

05:11.682 --> 05:12.942
(Clicks seat belt release)

05:12.943 --> 05:13.983
And you were forced to
take a leave of absence,

05:13.984 --> 05:15.485
and that it was
your first day back,

05:15.486 --> 05:17.817
and it's a good bet that
you might have some...

05:17.818 --> 05:20.089
Transitioning... issues.

05:20.090 --> 05:24.394
Dr. Hunt?

05:24.395 --> 05:25.755
Have you had breakfast yet?

05:25.756 --> 05:27.026
What? Me neither.

05:27.027 --> 05:29.399
I would like a gruyere omelet,

05:29.400 --> 05:31.461
uh, Turkey bacon, coffee black.

05:31.462 --> 05:32.632
But i...

05:32.633 --> 05:34.864
Oh, and take your
time. Got this covered.

05:34.865 --> 05:36.936
Wait. Dr. Hunt!

05:36.937 --> 05:39.709
So I'll meet you
back at the scene?

05:39.710 --> 05:40.870
(Police radio chatter)

05:40.871 --> 05:43.573
(Camera shutter
clicking, flash buzzing)

05:43.574 --> 05:46.345
Yo, what is she doing?
You let her in? Hey!

05:46.346 --> 05:47.647
(Clicking continues)

05:47.648 --> 05:49.379
(Buzzing continues)

05:49.380 --> 05:52.121
Excuse me? Are you
the medical investigator?

05:52.122 --> 05:54.524
It's called medicolegal
investigator.

05:54.525 --> 05:55.725
And, no, I'm not.

05:55.726 --> 05:56.956
Well, I'm detective
Lucas. You can't be here.

05:56.957 --> 05:59.128
See that? Spider angioma.

05:59.129 --> 06:01.431
Lady, get away
from the body now.

06:01.432 --> 06:03.863
When blood and stomach
acid mix, they oxidize.

06:03.864 --> 06:05.765
We call it coffee ground emesis.

06:05.766 --> 06:07.897
He's got a hole in his stomach
or a tear in his esophagus.

06:07.898 --> 06:09.739
Either way, you've
wasted your time.

06:09.740 --> 06:12.371
It's not a homicide. This
guy drank himself to death.

06:12.372 --> 06:13.703
(Man) That's what we figured,

06:13.704 --> 06:15.845
but thought we'd
wait for the m.E.

06:15.846 --> 06:18.708
(People speaking indistinctly)

06:18.709 --> 06:20.710
Adam, say hello
to Dr. Megan hunt.

06:20.711 --> 06:22.652
(Adam) Hello.

06:22.653 --> 06:23.813
Tommy.

06:23.814 --> 06:24.785
Megan.

06:24.786 --> 06:26.956
You two know each other.

06:26.957 --> 06:28.118
(Thud)

06:32.723 --> 06:34.063
(Lowered voice) You
have five seconds to tell me

06:34.064 --> 06:35.825
what you're doing here.

06:35.826 --> 06:38.528
Well, I did my 20
years in New York.

06:38.529 --> 06:39.829
I needed a change of scenery.

06:39.830 --> 06:41.901
You always told me
how great it was here.

06:41.902 --> 06:43.002
Oh, it's just a
coincidence you're here?

06:43.003 --> 06:45.635
You just happened
to get this detail?

06:45.636 --> 06:47.406
No. There was an
opening. I took it.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.178
It's never gonna work.

06:49.179 --> 06:50.910
Why? We're both adults.

06:50.911 --> 06:52.682
(Laughs) No, that's
the problem, Tommy.

06:52.683 --> 06:54.144
You were never an adult.

06:55.686 --> 06:58.448
You actually thought
this was a good idea?

06:58.449 --> 07:02.692
I didn't say it was a good
idea, but... I did it anyway.

07:02.693 --> 07:06.626
Whatever you thought was
gonna happen between us?

07:06.627 --> 07:08.127
(Whispers) It's not.

07:08.128 --> 07:11.831
I didn't think anything was
going to happen between us...

07:11.832 --> 07:14.133
Today, except both of
us acting professional

07:14.134 --> 07:16.065
and getting the job done.

07:16.066 --> 07:17.436
I'm not going anywhere, Megan.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.068
Not talking to me
is not an option.

07:19.069 --> 07:21.011
Watch me.

07:23.073 --> 07:24.714
(Sighs deeply)

07:24.715 --> 07:26.877
(Sighs)

07:30.450 --> 07:32.522
Okay, look, I know
it's gotta be a shock,

07:32.523 --> 07:33.683
me showing up outta
nowhere like this.

07:33.684 --> 07:35.454
Shut up, you ass.

07:35.455 --> 07:36.727
(Sniffs)

07:38.789 --> 07:39.959
What's behind this building?

07:39.960 --> 07:41.131
No idea.

07:42.793 --> 07:44.463
Where you going?

07:44.464 --> 07:47.598
(People continue
speaking indistinctly)

07:49.069 --> 07:51.771
So what exactly is
it we're looking for?

07:51.772 --> 07:52.902
Drunk hasn't been
dead long enough

07:52.903 --> 07:55.805
to have a maggot
near him. (Sniffs)

07:55.806 --> 07:57.878
There's something else in here.

07:59.710 --> 08:01.782
(Sniffs)

08:03.684 --> 08:04.914
(Hinges squeak)

08:04.915 --> 08:06.687
(Sniffs)

08:09.790 --> 08:12.161
(Megan) We need to see
what's behind that door.

08:12.162 --> 08:14.694
I'll call in a warrant.

08:14.695 --> 08:15.866
No door, no warrant.

08:17.568 --> 08:18.728
Whoa.

08:18.729 --> 08:19.700
Ugh. (Coughs)

08:19.701 --> 08:21.771
Mnh. (Groans)

08:21.772 --> 08:23.133
(Coughs)

08:24.875 --> 08:26.577
God almighty.

08:30.711 --> 08:34.545
♪♪♪

08:43.153 --> 08:45.154
(Elevator bell dings)

08:45.155 --> 08:46.997
(Doors close)

08:48.228 --> 08:50.730
So this, uh, Dr. Megan hunt...

08:50.731 --> 08:52.862
Are you gonna tell me what's
going on between you two?

08:52.863 --> 08:54.003
Nothing.

08:54.004 --> 08:55.905
(Chuckles) Then
why are you primping?

08:55.906 --> 08:57.136
Primping?

08:57.137 --> 08:58.307
That's right. Primping.

08:58.308 --> 08:59.969
So what is she, an
ex-girlfriend, ex-wife?

08:59.970 --> 09:01.941
Don't tell me you don't
have a history. (Chuckles)

09:01.942 --> 09:04.574
Okay. Listen, you're my partner.

09:04.575 --> 09:06.716
You walk into a
room, I got your back.

09:06.717 --> 09:08.217
Somebody pulls a gun
on you, I shoot him dead.

09:08.218 --> 09:10.980
You say "primping"
to me again, I'll kill you.

09:10.981 --> 09:12.982
(Ding)

09:12.983 --> 09:14.954
How about fussing? And posing?

09:14.955 --> 09:16.926
Preening? I-I can keep going.

09:16.927 --> 09:18.087
(Megan) I've done
you guys the favor

09:18.088 --> 09:19.959
of keeping the rest
of them in their bags.

09:19.960 --> 09:21.961
All five have multiple
deep lacerations

09:21.962 --> 09:23.132
from a large knife.

09:23.133 --> 09:25.835
All five have sharp
force trauma to the neck.

09:25.836 --> 09:27.637
Yeah, so much for
easing your way back in.

09:27.638 --> 09:28.798
We have I.D.S?

09:28.799 --> 09:30.099
Got hits from a.F.I.S.

09:30.100 --> 09:31.671
They're veterans...

09:31.672 --> 09:34.774
Sergeant vilmar brazas,

09:34.775 --> 09:35.945
specialist Douglas Kessler,

09:35.946 --> 09:37.977
staff sergeant Vincent morgado,

09:37.978 --> 09:41.080
corporals Joel moskowitz,
and Caleb witsman.

09:41.081 --> 09:43.653
So we got a serial
killer targeting veterans.

09:43.654 --> 09:44.854
Yeah. The press'll
be all over this.

09:44.855 --> 09:46.916
Not just veterans.

09:46.917 --> 09:49.288
You see this fragment?
That's shrapnel.

09:49.289 --> 09:50.289
He's got half his
shoulder blown off.

09:50.290 --> 09:51.821
They're combat veterans.

09:51.822 --> 09:54.063
And according to
their files at the v.A.,

09:54.064 --> 09:56.125
they're all being
treated for p.T.S.D.

09:56.126 --> 09:57.667
All right, I want Curtis
in charge of bugs

09:57.668 --> 09:59.128
for time of death.

09:59.129 --> 10:00.900
I want Ethan in charge of
trace and fluids through the lab.

10:00.901 --> 10:03.032
They're already on it.
Do you have any leads?

10:03.033 --> 10:04.904
Well, the building's been
abandoned for over a year.

10:04.905 --> 10:06.235
We're tracking down the owner.

10:06.236 --> 10:09.278
Any interest in knowing who
the next victim's gonna be?

10:09.279 --> 10:10.881
Why? You got a name for us?

10:14.184 --> 10:15.284
All five men are roughly

10:15.285 --> 10:17.917
the same height,
age, and weight.

10:17.918 --> 10:20.249
And according to the different
stages of decomposition,

10:20.250 --> 10:21.620
they were killed sequentially.

10:21.621 --> 10:22.952
If I were you,

10:22.953 --> 10:25.324
I would head to the v.A. And
find a matching description.

10:25.325 --> 10:27.026
Whoever did this

10:27.027 --> 10:31.300
seems to lose interest in
one and move on to the next.

10:31.301 --> 10:32.962
(Kate) Did you find something?
You know what I was thinking?

10:32.963 --> 10:34.664
Maybe we should call the v.A...

10:34.665 --> 10:36.836
And see if we get anybody
that matches that description.

10:36.837 --> 10:37.967
You know, just in case.

10:37.968 --> 10:38.968
Just in case.

10:38.969 --> 10:40.910
(Tommy) We would've
done it anyway.

10:40.911 --> 10:42.141
Detectives?

10:42.142 --> 10:43.813
(Adam and Tommy) Yeah?

10:43.814 --> 10:45.975
They've all had their
spleens removed.

10:45.976 --> 10:47.747
You mean, like organ harvesting?

10:47.748 --> 10:49.148
We can live just fine
without our spleens.

10:49.149 --> 10:50.780
Nobody transplants spleens.

10:50.781 --> 10:51.951
Not to mention they
wouldn't remove them

10:51.952 --> 10:53.753
with the kind of
knife that did all this.

10:53.754 --> 10:55.055
(Cell phone rings)

10:57.287 --> 11:00.289
They just picked up
the building owner.

11:00.290 --> 11:02.331
You'll let us know if
anything else comes up?

11:02.332 --> 11:04.033
Of course.

11:04.034 --> 11:06.696
All right, keep me updated on
everything to do with this case.

11:06.697 --> 11:08.397
Got it?

11:08.398 --> 11:10.169
Don't I always?

11:10.170 --> 11:11.340
(Chuckles)

11:11.341 --> 11:15.044
♪ Come to dinner,
little buddies ♪

11:15.045 --> 11:16.846
♪ a-nibble nibble, yum yum ♪

11:16.847 --> 11:18.347
♪ a-nibble nibble, hoo ♪

11:18.348 --> 11:20.049
Singing again?

11:20.050 --> 11:21.450
Sometimes I think you like
bugs more than you like me.

11:21.451 --> 11:23.182
Because they
actually do their job

11:23.183 --> 11:24.884
and help me
estimate time of death.

11:24.885 --> 11:27.186
Ohh! Don't move!

11:27.187 --> 11:28.387
I'm working here,
man! Don't move!

11:28.388 --> 11:30.860
Excuse me, guys?

11:30.861 --> 11:31.961
Oh, hey...

11:31.962 --> 11:33.122
(Snaps fingers)

11:33.123 --> 11:34.363
Charlotte. Charlotte.

11:34.364 --> 11:36.967
Where is Dr. Hunt?

11:52.342 --> 11:55.714
Dr. Hunt? I've
got your breakfast.

11:55.715 --> 11:57.086
Stop!

11:57.087 --> 12:00.090
No food in the autopsy.
You, get it out of here.

12:02.052 --> 12:03.993
(Sighs) Okay. That's my bad.

12:03.994 --> 12:07.226
I'm just not used to
fetching my m.E. Breakfast.

12:07.227 --> 12:08.998
I'm not a gofer.
I'm a trained...

12:08.999 --> 12:10.199
What does this look like to you?

12:10.200 --> 12:12.802
Um... tissue paper?

12:12.803 --> 12:13.963
Taken from the wall
of a retroperitoneum?

12:13.964 --> 12:14.935
I don't think so.

12:14.936 --> 12:16.105
(Instrument clatters)

12:16.106 --> 12:17.807
Want to try again?

12:17.808 --> 12:19.068
A suture.

12:19.069 --> 12:21.470
And from the color and
texture, we can tell what?

12:21.471 --> 12:23.112
(Sighs) Um...

12:23.113 --> 12:25.915
It's a drug-eluting suture.
And what does that tell us?

12:25.916 --> 12:27.516
Um...

12:27.517 --> 12:28.949
Look at the body.

12:30.080 --> 12:32.882
I don't know. What
does that tell you?

12:32.883 --> 12:34.824
It tells me that you worked
in a teaching hospital

12:34.825 --> 12:36.155
and didn't learn a
damn thing. (Clatters)

12:36.156 --> 12:39.088
Somewhere behind all of
this violence is a surgeon.

12:39.089 --> 12:40.259
Start taking pictures

12:40.260 --> 12:41.791
and send them to
my office immediately.

12:41.792 --> 12:44.133
And then ask yourself
how much more of this

12:44.134 --> 12:45.966
you really want to take.

12:47.798 --> 12:50.369
(People speaking indistinctly)

12:50.370 --> 12:51.871
Five people, Mr. Foster,

12:51.872 --> 12:54.103
all dead, in your building.

12:54.104 --> 12:56.946
The place has been
vacant for over a year.

12:56.947 --> 13:00.049
I don't know anything. I swear.

13:00.050 --> 13:01.811
When was the last
time you were there?

13:01.812 --> 13:02.982
A month.

13:02.983 --> 13:04.984
No, uh, two months.

13:04.985 --> 13:06.485
The economy's in the crapper.

13:06.486 --> 13:08.157
I can't get anyone to bite.

13:08.158 --> 13:09.488
You got a record.

13:09.489 --> 13:10.890
Who, me?

13:10.891 --> 13:12.391
Assault with a deadly weapon.

13:12.392 --> 13:15.024
What? No, that was...

13:15.025 --> 13:17.126
It was a beer bottle, okay?

13:17.127 --> 13:18.968
And I was just fighting back.

13:18.969 --> 13:21.530
Those cops were
disrupting a peaceful rally.

13:21.531 --> 13:23.572
Antiwar rally. (Knock on glass)

13:23.573 --> 13:25.034
What's that got to
do with anything?

13:25.035 --> 13:28.007
(Knock)

13:28.008 --> 13:30.410
(Sighs)

13:33.483 --> 13:35.014
Flattered,

13:35.015 --> 13:37.046
but I'm in the middle
of an interrogation.

13:37.047 --> 13:38.447
You would think
this is about you.

13:38.448 --> 13:40.119
Are you just in the
habit of interrupting?

13:40.120 --> 13:41.450
I don't work for you, Megan.

13:41.451 --> 13:43.893
This is my investigation.
It's my interrogation.

13:43.894 --> 13:45.925
You don't pull me out
of there for any reason.

13:45.926 --> 13:48.157
Hey, you're the new guy
here. I come and go as I please.

13:48.158 --> 13:50.159
How'd you like to get arrested?
How'd you like to solve the case?

13:50.160 --> 13:52.001
Gee, guys.

13:52.002 --> 13:53.362
People will start to talk.

13:53.363 --> 13:54.934
She was just leaving.

13:54.935 --> 13:56.866
Is that the guy who
owns the building?

13:56.867 --> 13:58.537
Yeah, why? He's not the killer.

13:58.538 --> 14:00.169
How do you know?

14:00.170 --> 14:02.271
Because all five men had
their spleens removed surgically.

14:02.272 --> 14:03.442
But I thought your
colleague said...

14:03.443 --> 14:04.944
I know what she said,
but the knife wounds

14:04.945 --> 14:07.046
were made to disguise
the surgical incisions.

14:07.047 --> 14:09.548
The cavities were
pretty hacked up, too.

14:09.549 --> 14:12.051
But I managed to
find a couple of things

14:12.052 --> 14:13.923
that the killer left behind.

14:13.924 --> 14:15.985
That is a drug-eluting suture.

14:15.986 --> 14:17.256
It releases a
combination of antibiotics

14:17.257 --> 14:20.029
at the point of incision
to prevent infection.

14:20.030 --> 14:22.061
So he's removing an
organ you say nobody needs

14:22.062 --> 14:23.963
and keeping them alive
just to kill them later.

14:23.964 --> 14:24.994
Exactly.

14:24.995 --> 14:26.865
And that particular
suture technique

14:26.866 --> 14:29.939
is most commonly
found in plastic surgery.

14:29.940 --> 14:32.071
So you're saying our
killer is a plastic surgeon?

14:32.072 --> 14:34.403
I'm saying that unless this guy

14:34.404 --> 14:36.645
has had ten years
of medical training,

14:36.646 --> 14:38.148
he's not the killer.

14:41.281 --> 14:44.213
(Man grunts and pants)

14:44.214 --> 14:48.317
(Monitor beeping rhythmically)

14:48.318 --> 14:52.222
(Grunting)

14:54.064 --> 14:55.995
(Muffled voice) No!

14:55.996 --> 14:58.968
(Groaning)

14:58.969 --> 15:01.931
No! No! Aah!

15:01.932 --> 15:03.203
(Groans)

15:19.389 --> 15:21.090
Dr. Hunt,

15:21.091 --> 15:23.292
preliminary times of
death are consistent

15:23.293 --> 15:25.294
with a 48-hour interval
between each murder.

15:25.295 --> 15:27.396
Working back from
the most recent one,

15:27.397 --> 15:29.198
he's killed 'em
all at lunchtime.

15:29.199 --> 15:30.429
Any word on that foreign matter

15:30.430 --> 15:31.961
I took off the retroperitoneum?

15:31.962 --> 15:33.302
Uh, not yet,

15:33.303 --> 15:35.234
but we caught a break
on the drug-eluting suture.

15:35.235 --> 15:38.107
It's proprietary and currently
in use in a medical study.

15:38.108 --> 15:40.669
There's only one medical center
in the city approved to use it,

15:40.670 --> 15:42.041
and guess what.

15:42.042 --> 15:43.172
Plastic surgery practice.

15:43.173 --> 15:44.513
You're welcome.

15:44.514 --> 15:45.944
Thank you. Mm-hmm.

15:45.945 --> 15:48.117
(Indistinct conversations)

15:48.118 --> 15:49.178
Hey, Ethan.

15:49.179 --> 15:50.349
Hmm?

15:50.350 --> 15:52.051
Aww, poor Cheryl.

15:52.052 --> 15:54.423
Charlotte.

15:54.424 --> 15:56.485
Damn, that was fast.

15:56.486 --> 15:58.027
What did I tell you?

15:58.028 --> 15:59.288
Dr. Hunt's like grappa.

15:59.289 --> 16:01.231
She'll tear your throat out.

16:02.592 --> 16:04.133
You wanted to see me?

16:04.134 --> 16:05.364
Yeah, how's it
going with Charlotte?

16:05.365 --> 16:06.535
Great.

16:06.536 --> 16:08.967
Really? That's strange,
because she quit.

16:08.968 --> 16:11.170
And don't think I'm gonna
let you browbeat the next one.

16:11.171 --> 16:12.102
I don't need an m.I.

16:12.103 --> 16:13.302
Damn it, Megan.

16:13.303 --> 16:15.744
You and I both know
what this is about, all right?

16:15.745 --> 16:17.106
You don't want
to let go of Peter,

16:17.107 --> 16:18.307
and you're taking it
out on his replacement.

16:18.308 --> 16:19.478
She was a moron.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.410
It was her second day.

16:21.411 --> 16:23.452
And you were supposed
to be her mentor.

16:23.453 --> 16:25.454
Do you remember
when Peter first started?

16:25.455 --> 16:27.456
Yeah, and I wanted
to fire him, too.

16:27.457 --> 16:29.119
And you know what?

16:30.690 --> 16:33.423
I wish to god I had.

16:35.165 --> 16:38.097
His splenic artery
was transected.

16:38.098 --> 16:40.999
You called 9-1-1.
You attempted c.P.R.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.301
There is not a
surgeon in the world

16:42.302 --> 16:44.134
who could've saved his life.

16:46.176 --> 16:48.738
I have a lead on our
killer, so if you don't mind...

16:51.211 --> 16:54.383
So how do you plan
on identifying this guy?

16:54.384 --> 16:57.015
By examining his handiwork.

16:57.016 --> 16:59.017
The suturing was left-handed.
The knot was distinctive.

16:59.018 --> 17:00.389
It's a kind of signature.

17:00.390 --> 17:01.750
Hold on. We can't just
walk around asking women

17:01.751 --> 17:03.152
to lift up their shirts, can we?

17:03.153 --> 17:05.424
You can't.

17:05.425 --> 17:09.058
(People speaking indistinctly)

17:09.059 --> 17:10.199
Hello, I am Dr. Hunt.

17:10.200 --> 17:12.161
I'm with the medical
examiner's office.

17:12.162 --> 17:15.234
Would you mind if I took
a look at your incisions?

17:15.235 --> 17:17.507
Thank you.

17:21.611 --> 17:23.613
Uh-huh.

17:26.476 --> 17:29.149
Hello. Dr. Hunt.

17:32.222 --> 17:34.423
Nice.

17:34.424 --> 17:36.085
Who's your surgeon?

17:36.086 --> 17:38.427
(People speaking indistinctly)

17:38.428 --> 17:39.588
Uh, can I help you?

17:39.589 --> 17:40.790
Yeah, do you... do you...

17:42.832 --> 17:44.563
Do you work for Dr. Wallace?

17:44.564 --> 17:46.195
I'm his chief nurse.

17:46.196 --> 17:47.396
Mm-hmm. You keep his schedule?

17:47.397 --> 17:48.667
Yes, of course.

17:48.668 --> 17:49.838
Okay, I'm gonna
need to see that.

17:49.839 --> 17:51.540
Yvonne, what's going on?

17:51.541 --> 17:54.104
Dr. Wallace, we're gonna
need to speak with you.

17:55.445 --> 17:56.706
(Adam) Uh, you, too, Yvonne.

17:58.108 --> 18:01.280
(Tommy) What do you got
against veterans, doctor?

18:01.281 --> 18:03.282
Wh... i-i have nothing
against veterans.

18:03.283 --> 18:05.114
What are you talking about?

18:05.115 --> 18:07.216
You got divorced
about a year ago, right?

18:07.217 --> 18:09.418
Your daughter's living
with your ex-wife now.

18:09.419 --> 18:11.120
Yeah. That's right.

18:11.121 --> 18:13.162
Yeah, I'm sorry to hear
that. That's gotta be tough.

18:13.163 --> 18:14.493
But to deal with it,
you took a little trip,

18:14.494 --> 18:15.664
and not just any trip.

18:15.665 --> 18:17.166
You went to that
middle eastern paradise

18:17.167 --> 18:18.167
called Afghanistan.

18:18.168 --> 18:19.668
That was a humanitarian mission.

18:19.669 --> 18:20.829
Right.

18:20.830 --> 18:23.172
It's good of you to give back.

18:23.173 --> 18:24.573
And while there,

18:24.574 --> 18:26.575
you were repairing the
faces of these Afghan kids

18:26.576 --> 18:28.577
who were disfigured in
the U.S. drone strikes.

18:28.578 --> 18:30.239
Mm-hmm.

18:30.240 --> 18:32.481
Yeah, be enough to turn anybody
against our troops, wouldn't it?

18:32.482 --> 18:34.683
(Adam) You met
Dr. Wallace through

18:34.684 --> 18:36.185
this humanitarian mission?

18:36.186 --> 18:37.516
That's right.

18:37.517 --> 18:39.188
And he relies on you.
He trusts you, right?

18:39.189 --> 18:40.689
Yes, of course.

18:40.690 --> 18:42.151
And forgive me, Yvonne,
but the problem I'm having is,

18:42.152 --> 18:44.153
how come you can't
account for his whereabouts

18:44.154 --> 18:46.626
every time one of these
men has been killed?

18:48.328 --> 18:50.128
I... (Megan) If it wasn't you,

18:50.129 --> 18:52.161
then explain your
fancy stitch work...

18:52.162 --> 18:55.164
On all of our victims

18:55.165 --> 18:59.208
or the eluting suture coated
in rifampin and minocycline

18:59.209 --> 19:01.870
that your medical practice
is the only one in the city

19:01.871 --> 19:03.712
approved to use.

19:03.713 --> 19:05.274
No. There's a...

19:05.275 --> 19:07.816
There's a... there's
a secondary market

19:07.817 --> 19:09.548
for medical supplies.

19:09.549 --> 19:11.580
Any surgeon could get his hands
on this suture if he wanted to.

19:11.581 --> 19:14.223
And most surgeons
mimic the closing technique

19:14.224 --> 19:16.225
of the surgeons
they trained under.

19:16.226 --> 19:17.886
Since I went to
medical school here,

19:17.887 --> 19:19.428
I'm sure that there are
plenty of others in the area.

19:19.429 --> 19:21.190
A-As a former surgeon,
I'm frankly surprised

19:21.191 --> 19:22.491
you need to be told any of this.

19:22.492 --> 19:25.765
Now am I under arrest
or am I free to go?

19:27.537 --> 19:28.697
(Adam) Come on, Yvonne.

19:28.698 --> 19:30.168
Are you telling me
you haven't noticed

19:30.169 --> 19:31.900
anything strange about
his behavior, his attitude?

19:31.901 --> 19:33.543
I don't know anything.

19:35.375 --> 19:38.877
You're trembling, Yvonne.

19:38.878 --> 19:41.410
Why don't I believe you?

19:41.411 --> 19:44.953
My husband died in Afghanistan.

19:44.954 --> 19:46.955
That's why I volunteered
for Dr. Wallace's mission.

19:46.956 --> 19:49.288
I just... i cannot believe
that he would ever,

19:49.289 --> 19:52.291
ever do something like this.

19:52.292 --> 19:53.823
(Sniffles)

19:55.895 --> 19:57.426
(People speaking indistinctly)

19:57.427 --> 19:58.928
Thank you, Yvonne.

20:01.301 --> 20:02.931
So Yvonne's on our side.

20:02.932 --> 20:05.203
She said she'll call
if she finds anything.

20:05.204 --> 20:07.506
Finds anything? What
more do you need?

20:07.507 --> 20:09.438
I just handed you
a guy with means,

20:09.439 --> 20:10.909
motive, and opportunity...
(Elevator bell dings)

20:10.910 --> 20:12.241
And...

20:12.242 --> 20:13.412
You're letting him go.

20:13.413 --> 20:14.583
You didn't give us anything.

20:14.584 --> 20:16.385
He explained away
all the evidence.

20:16.386 --> 20:19.288
Did you see the way
he was acting in there?

20:19.289 --> 20:20.619
That may be enough for
the court of Megan hunt,

20:20.620 --> 20:22.220
but not enough for us.

20:22.221 --> 20:24.323
Put a tail on him.

20:24.324 --> 20:25.824
Sure. (Chuckles)

20:25.825 --> 20:27.356
Right after we play our hand,

20:27.357 --> 20:28.827
he's gonna lead
us to his next victim.

20:28.828 --> 20:30.659
The guy's a butcher, Tommy.

20:30.660 --> 20:32.020
Are you just gonna
let this guy go?

20:44.474 --> 20:46.515
(Kate) They're all
combat veterans.

20:46.516 --> 20:48.347
We're not sure why
they were targeted,

20:48.348 --> 20:50.879
but we believe the
killer may be a surgeon.

20:50.880 --> 20:53.282
I understand Dr. Hunt
is on the case.

20:53.283 --> 20:56.285
Didn't she just come back
from a forced leave of absence?

20:56.286 --> 20:57.926
Are you questioning
my judgment, Dan?

20:57.927 --> 21:00.559
No. I'm just telling you
the stakes are higher now.

21:00.560 --> 21:03.292
It's been quite a
year for you, Kate...

21:03.293 --> 21:04.593
The marburg outbreak,

21:04.594 --> 21:06.665
putting your life on the line.

21:06.666 --> 21:08.867
It's been noticed
in certain circles.

21:08.868 --> 21:09.998
Circles that would be helpful

21:09.999 --> 21:12.000
if you were interested
in elected office.

21:12.001 --> 21:14.303
And why would you think that?

21:14.304 --> 21:15.444
Because you've been talking to

21:15.445 --> 21:16.905
the same consultants
I've been talking to.

21:16.906 --> 21:18.347
(Chuckles)

21:18.348 --> 21:19.378
We both know the second
congressional district

21:19.379 --> 21:20.649
is up for grabs next year.

21:20.650 --> 21:22.911
Let's not be coy
with each other.

21:22.912 --> 21:24.413
(People speaking indistinctly)

21:24.414 --> 21:26.455
Well, then let's not
be disingenuous either.

21:26.456 --> 21:27.956
You're the district attorney.

21:27.957 --> 21:29.788
You've publicly expressed
your interest in that seat.

21:29.789 --> 21:31.790
Publicly, yes.
Privately, not anymore.

21:31.791 --> 21:33.692
If I'm to play a
role in the election,

21:33.693 --> 21:36.695
I'd like it to be backing
someone I believe in.

21:36.696 --> 21:39.067
So why should I back you, Kate?

21:39.068 --> 21:41.670
Because I'm the best
person for the job.

21:41.671 --> 21:43.001
I'm smart, telegenic,

21:43.002 --> 21:45.474
and I care about this
city and its suburbs.

21:45.475 --> 21:48.036
And if this year has
taught me anything,

21:48.037 --> 21:50.038
it's to take advantage
of your moment

21:50.039 --> 21:52.041
before it's gone.

21:54.844 --> 21:56.645
Then here's what
you need to do...

21:56.646 --> 21:59.418
Spend the next six
months building yourself up,

21:59.419 --> 22:00.919
taking the lead on
high-profile cases,

22:00.920 --> 22:02.491
honing your image
as a public servant.

22:02.492 --> 22:03.952
I think I can do that.

22:03.953 --> 22:06.054
That you will shine on
camera, I have no doubt.

22:06.055 --> 22:09.528
But there will be times
when your future interests

22:09.529 --> 22:10.999
will conflict with your
current responsibilities.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.701
Now how you handle that

22:12.702 --> 22:15.063
will tell me all I need to know.

22:15.064 --> 22:16.665
Sorry. I have to run.

22:16.666 --> 22:19.468
Stay on top of this
serial killer case.

22:19.469 --> 22:23.543
Someone hacking up veterans
is bad press for all concerned.

22:29.078 --> 22:30.449
(Phone rings) (Sighs)

22:30.450 --> 22:31.620
(Tommy) Yeah.

22:31.621 --> 22:32.781
You miss me already?

22:32.782 --> 22:34.122
Wallace said that everyone

22:34.123 --> 22:36.425
he trained with would use
the same suturing technique,

22:36.426 --> 22:37.756
right?

22:37.757 --> 22:38.927
Well, I am looking

22:38.928 --> 22:41.129
at the penn hill
medical school web site,

22:41.130 --> 22:43.061
and none of his fellow residents

22:43.062 --> 22:45.694
are currently working
within the area.

22:45.695 --> 22:47.095
It's still not enough
to arrest him.

22:47.096 --> 22:49.798
No, but it's enough to get
you off your ass and watch him.

22:49.799 --> 22:51.369
Well, it just so happens
that Dr. Wallace

22:51.370 --> 22:52.871
went straight
back to his office,

22:52.872 --> 22:54.903
and he hasn't been out since.

22:54.904 --> 22:56.905
I thought you weren't
putting a tail on him.

22:56.906 --> 22:58.046
Of course I put a tail on him.

22:58.047 --> 22:59.377
He's the only lead we have.

22:59.378 --> 23:00.749
Then why'd you give
me such a hard time?

23:00.750 --> 23:01.910
I don't know.

23:01.911 --> 23:03.552
Why can't the eagles
win a super bowl?

23:03.553 --> 23:05.984
You really are an
ass, you know that?

23:05.985 --> 23:07.516
Boy, you got a mouth on you.

23:07.517 --> 23:09.017
As soon as he leaves,

23:09.018 --> 23:11.820
I want to know where he goes.

23:11.821 --> 23:13.862
Why don't you go to the academy

23:13.863 --> 23:15.994
earn your badge, make captain?

23:15.995 --> 23:17.496
Then you can tell me what to do.

23:17.497 --> 23:19.067
How about this?

23:19.068 --> 23:21.670
Wallace has violated everything
there is to being a doctor.

23:21.671 --> 23:23.031
All right, I promise you,

23:23.032 --> 23:24.533
if Wallace leads
us to another victim,

23:24.534 --> 23:26.004
I'll be way too
busy to call you,

23:26.005 --> 23:28.437
but you'll be in my thoughts.

23:28.438 --> 23:30.078
(Dial tone drones,
knock on door)

23:30.079 --> 23:32.110
(Curtis) Megan. What?

23:32.111 --> 23:33.482
I got a bug.

23:33.483 --> 23:34.943
It's one of hundreds
pulled off the victims

23:34.944 --> 23:36.485
to establish time of death.

23:36.486 --> 23:38.947
At first, I thought it was
one of my regular domestics,

23:38.948 --> 23:40.919
but its lifecycle is anomalous.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.090
So what is it?

23:42.091 --> 23:43.151
That's the thing...
I don't know.

23:43.152 --> 23:44.923
I've never seen the
damn thing before.

23:44.924 --> 23:46.925
Then go find out. What
are you waiting for?

23:46.926 --> 23:49.758
What do you... (Sighs) Ooh.

23:49.759 --> 23:51.700
(Sighs)

23:51.701 --> 23:54.062
(Keyboard keys click)

23:54.063 --> 23:56.965
Megan really pushes
your buttons, doesn't she?

23:56.966 --> 23:58.607
We push each other's buttons.

23:58.608 --> 24:00.068
I'm still waiting
for the reason why.

24:00.069 --> 24:01.910
Oh, are you?

24:01.911 --> 24:04.543
(Cell phone rings)

24:04.544 --> 24:06.815
(Rings and beeps) Yeah, Lucas.

24:06.816 --> 24:10.078
Oh, really?

24:10.079 --> 24:12.120
You sure about that?

24:12.121 --> 24:14.923
Huh. Okay, thank you.

24:14.924 --> 24:16.154
(Beep)

24:16.155 --> 24:19.828
So remember that list we
requested from the v.A...

24:19.829 --> 24:21.830
Veterans with the
same height, same age?

24:21.831 --> 24:24.993
Well, two weeks ago, someone
requested the exact same list.

24:24.994 --> 24:26.995
How many on the list?

24:26.996 --> 24:28.597
Ten.

24:28.598 --> 24:29.938
(Blows air)

24:29.939 --> 24:32.942
(People speaking indistinctly)

24:34.073 --> 24:35.905
(Sighs)

24:48.117 --> 24:50.720
(Exhales)

24:53.693 --> 24:54.863
Hi, mom.

24:54.864 --> 24:57.095
Hey.

24:57.096 --> 24:58.597
What are you doing here?

24:58.598 --> 25:00.629
I had to give you
this permission slip

25:00.630 --> 25:02.000
for the field trip tomorrow.

25:02.001 --> 25:03.672
Didn't I already sign this?

25:03.673 --> 25:05.133
Yeah, but this one will let me go
straight home from the museum

25:05.134 --> 25:06.635
instead of having to schlep
all the way back to school.

25:06.636 --> 25:08.277
Ah.

25:10.780 --> 25:11.941
(Clicks pen)

25:13.012 --> 25:14.512
How are you doing, mom?

25:14.513 --> 25:15.845
Fine.

25:17.146 --> 25:19.088
Are you sure you're
ready to be back?

25:21.951 --> 25:23.752
Let me see your pump.

25:23.753 --> 25:24.993
What?

25:24.994 --> 25:26.725
Your pump. Your cartridge
looked low yesterday.

25:26.726 --> 25:27.896
You're changing the subject.

25:27.897 --> 25:29.027
Let me see it.

25:29.028 --> 25:31.159
(Sighs) Okay.

25:31.160 --> 25:33.001
Okay, I'll make you a deal.

25:33.002 --> 25:35.233
I promise to stop asking

25:35.234 --> 25:36.935
if you promise to sound
super-duper happy

25:36.936 --> 25:38.166
the next time I talk to you.

25:38.167 --> 25:39.167
Okay?

25:39.168 --> 25:40.538
(Chuckles)

25:40.539 --> 25:42.271
Super-duper.

25:43.673 --> 25:46.575
(Knock on door)

25:46.576 --> 25:49.247
Mr. Simmons, your name's
on a list used to target veterans.

25:49.248 --> 25:50.619
Target them for what?

25:50.620 --> 25:52.180
Well, so far, of the
ten names on the list,

25:52.181 --> 25:54.182
five are confirmed
dead, one's missing.

25:54.183 --> 25:55.684
Look, we don't know who's
doing the killing or why.

25:55.685 --> 25:57.826
We're just here to tell
you, you may be in danger,

25:57.827 --> 25:59.027
offer you police protection.

25:59.028 --> 26:01.560
I'll be fine.

26:05.935 --> 26:08.036
I got my own protection.

26:08.037 --> 26:10.138
Whoa, whoa! Put the gun down.

26:10.139 --> 26:12.671
Put it down, Mr. Simmons.

26:12.672 --> 26:13.873
(Clicks gun)

26:15.074 --> 26:19.077
You got a license
for that gun, I assume.

26:19.078 --> 26:20.949
Oh, yeah.

26:20.950 --> 26:22.781
It's funny, though, you
checking on my paperwork,

26:22.782 --> 26:24.082
'cause the whole
reason I joined the army

26:24.083 --> 26:26.755
was to protect my country

26:26.756 --> 26:29.187
from people nobody
bothered checking on.

26:29.188 --> 26:31.289
Look, we appreciate
your service, Mr. Simmons.

26:31.290 --> 26:33.591
We're just asking
you to be careful.

26:33.592 --> 26:36.094
Let us handle the bad guys.

26:36.095 --> 26:37.796
Oh, let you handle the bad guys?

26:37.797 --> 26:39.728
What, you mean, like,
read them their rights,

26:39.729 --> 26:43.101
or give them civilian trials

26:43.102 --> 26:46.605
or apologize every time
somebody sneezes on the koran?

26:47.877 --> 26:49.607
(Exhales deeply)

26:49.608 --> 26:52.310
Every week, I see
guys like me at the v.A...

26:52.311 --> 26:55.644
P.t.s.d., verge of suicide...

26:55.645 --> 26:58.016
Just wishing our government
cared as much about their rights

26:58.017 --> 27:00.318
as they do about
the bad guy's rights.

27:00.319 --> 27:03.091
If this guy comes
anywhere near me,

27:03.092 --> 27:04.793
I'll do the handling.

27:04.794 --> 27:07.195
Oh, that would
be a very bad idea.

27:07.196 --> 27:09.758
Maybe not.

27:09.759 --> 27:10.929
We know this guy
is targeting veterans,

27:10.930 --> 27:12.101
your name is on the list.

27:14.904 --> 27:17.706
You can use me as bait?

27:17.707 --> 27:19.708
Officially, we can't
ask you to do that.

27:19.709 --> 27:21.710
Who's asking? I'm there.

27:21.711 --> 27:23.171
Just put me in front
of the son of a bitch.

27:23.172 --> 27:25.114
I'll show you what a vet can do.

27:27.276 --> 27:29.377
Got a cheesesteak,

27:29.378 --> 27:32.120
extra cheesy steak, pizza steak.

27:32.121 --> 27:33.281
There you go. Thank you.

27:33.282 --> 27:36.154
You guys hungry? I'll
spring for both of you.

27:36.155 --> 27:39.858
Gotta spend my
discharge money somehow.

27:39.859 --> 27:41.159
No, thanks, Karl. We're good.

27:41.160 --> 27:43.161
Let's keep an eye out, okay?

27:43.162 --> 27:45.293
You gotta love this guy, huh?

27:45.294 --> 27:47.435
You're awful quiet.

27:47.436 --> 27:49.237
We're using a paranoid
vet with p.T.S.D.

27:49.238 --> 27:50.939
As bait for a serial killer.

27:50.940 --> 27:52.801
There's not much
else to say, is there?

27:52.802 --> 27:53.902
I improvised.

27:53.903 --> 27:55.004
Oh, right.

27:57.276 --> 27:58.446
Oh, I forgot.

27:58.447 --> 28:00.048
Dr. Hunt called for you earlier.

28:00.049 --> 28:01.750
Oh, yeah. What did she say?

28:01.751 --> 28:03.281
She said you wanted
to get married, have kids,

28:03.282 --> 28:04.783
but, you know, it was too soon.

28:04.784 --> 28:07.155
She was so young. You
were so poor. It was so sad.

28:07.156 --> 28:09.057
Yeah? Yeah.

28:09.058 --> 28:12.161
You know I'm not gonna
stop until you tell me, right?

28:14.393 --> 28:17.766
20 years ago, I was
working vice undercover.

28:17.767 --> 28:19.768
I ended up getting shot.
Megan was a resident.

28:19.769 --> 28:22.070
She stitched me up.

28:22.071 --> 28:23.271
And?

28:23.272 --> 28:24.973
We had a thing.

28:24.974 --> 28:26.234
Just a thing?

28:26.235 --> 28:29.838
Or a crazy, mind-blowing,
once-in-a-lifetime thing?

28:29.839 --> 28:31.009
What happened?

28:31.010 --> 28:32.210
I screwed it up.

28:32.211 --> 28:34.142
She packed her bags,
just went back to Philly.

28:34.143 --> 28:35.483
Now you want her back.

28:35.484 --> 28:36.785
I didn't say that.

28:36.786 --> 28:38.086
Oh, I would have to
be one lame detective

28:38.087 --> 28:39.247
if you had to.

28:39.248 --> 28:42.320
(Mouth full) Oh, guys.

28:42.321 --> 28:46.124
You gotta taste this
thing. It's... it's awesome.

28:46.125 --> 28:47.255
You know, I gotta get a...

28:47.256 --> 28:49.057
(static crackles)

28:49.058 --> 28:50.359
Karl, you all right?

28:54.163 --> 28:55.804
Karl! Karl!

28:55.805 --> 28:56.905
Karl!

28:56.906 --> 28:58.437
Karl?

29:16.986 --> 29:18.957
Wallace went to a movie,

29:18.958 --> 29:20.989
slipped out the back.

29:20.990 --> 29:23.862
Our guys didn't get ahold
of it till after midnight.

29:23.863 --> 29:25.093
Check with nurse Yvonne?

29:25.094 --> 29:27.265
Yeah, she hasn't
heard from him all night.

29:27.266 --> 29:29.297
C.s.u.'s got zilch
off the tire marks.

29:29.298 --> 29:31.139
No traffic camera
in either direction.

29:31.140 --> 29:33.372
I served up Karl to this
guy on a silver platter.

29:36.305 --> 29:38.247
(Trash can clatters)

29:51.160 --> 29:53.422
Where the hell are you at?

29:57.466 --> 30:01.230
What's your name,
you little suckers?

30:04.033 --> 30:05.874
The khapra beetle.

30:05.875 --> 30:09.277
'Bout time I found your ass.

30:09.278 --> 30:11.980
"Eats dried plant
and animal matter,

30:11.981 --> 30:13.541
"including dried blood.

30:13.542 --> 30:15.313
"Native to India.

30:15.314 --> 30:16.484
"On the department
of agriculture's

30:16.485 --> 30:19.547
"100 most invasive species list.

30:19.548 --> 30:21.850
Shipments from infested
countries"... (Elevator bell dings)

30:21.851 --> 30:24.152
"Are subject to customs
search and quarantine."

30:24.153 --> 30:26.354
Hot damn.

30:26.355 --> 30:28.456
(Clicks keyboard keys)

30:28.457 --> 30:30.328
Megan.

30:30.329 --> 30:31.499
Have you been here all night?

30:31.500 --> 30:33.532
I know where your killer is.

30:38.467 --> 30:40.169
(Tires squeal)

30:44.143 --> 30:46.575
(Tires squeal)

30:48.617 --> 30:51.951
(Tires squeal)

30:54.223 --> 30:57.285
Curtis said a shipment came
in from India two weeks ago.

30:57.286 --> 30:59.187
They quarantined
containers in berth 23.

30:59.188 --> 31:00.388
Where are you going?

31:00.389 --> 31:02.230
Berth twenty... oh. Whoa.

31:02.231 --> 31:04.162
No, no. You stay here.

31:04.163 --> 31:05.934
Don't you even try
to tell me what to do.

31:05.935 --> 31:07.365
Megan, you're not
armed, you're not a cop.

31:07.366 --> 31:08.866
You take one more step, i'm
gonna handcuff you to that pole,

31:08.867 --> 31:10.038
and you know I'll do it.

31:10.039 --> 31:11.339
Yeah? Is that what
you're into these days?

31:11.340 --> 31:13.201
Sit tight, Megan. I'll call
you when I need you.

31:13.202 --> 31:15.044
That's an order.

31:24.353 --> 31:26.054
(Footsteps approach)

31:26.055 --> 31:28.056
What did I tell you?

31:28.057 --> 31:29.217
Stuff it, Tommy.

31:29.218 --> 31:31.560
(Bird wings flapping)

31:43.102 --> 31:46.235
(Flapping)

31:48.637 --> 31:50.638
Megan.

31:50.639 --> 31:54.142
(Monitor beeping rhythmically)

31:54.143 --> 31:56.484
He's dead.

31:56.485 --> 31:58.016
This one's alive.

31:58.017 --> 31:59.447
It's Karl.

31:59.448 --> 32:01.519
This guy's gonna bleed
out if I don't close him up.

32:01.520 --> 32:03.621
I'm gonna need some help here.

32:03.622 --> 32:04.993
You're a surgeon, aren't you?

32:04.994 --> 32:06.294
I'm not an anesthesiologist.

32:06.295 --> 32:07.996
(Object clatters)
Tommy. Tommy, let's go.

32:07.997 --> 32:09.327
Do your best.

32:09.328 --> 32:11.030
Tommy. (Huffs)

32:19.268 --> 32:22.171
Get down! Philly p.D.

32:35.054 --> 32:38.487
(Monitor beeping rhythmically)

33:00.309 --> 33:01.550
(Grunts)

33:10.259 --> 33:13.621
(Sizzling)

33:13.622 --> 33:15.394
(Monitor beeps rhythmically)

33:19.028 --> 33:20.468
(Monitor emitting
continuous tone)

33:20.469 --> 33:21.699
Ah. B.P.'S crashing.

33:21.700 --> 33:24.203
Don't you dare die on me.

33:27.076 --> 33:28.706
(Wallace grunts)

33:28.707 --> 33:31.239
(Adam) Just stay calm. (Wallace)
I'll stay calm! You don't move!

33:31.240 --> 33:32.310
(Tommy) Hey!

33:32.311 --> 33:33.381
Drop it! Drop your weapon!

33:33.382 --> 33:35.413
It's over, doc.
There's nowhere to go.

33:35.414 --> 33:37.115
You don't understand.
They made me do it.

33:37.116 --> 33:39.187
I didn't want to
help them. I had to.

33:39.188 --> 33:41.390
Now drop your gun
or I'm gonna kill him!

33:46.455 --> 33:48.097
Yeah.

33:51.460 --> 33:54.302
Whoa. Whew. Whew.

33:54.303 --> 33:56.064
(Pants)

33:56.065 --> 33:57.205
You okay?

33:57.206 --> 33:58.366
Huh?!

33:58.367 --> 33:59.707
I told you, somebody
pulls a gun on you,

33:59.708 --> 34:01.209
I'm gonna shoot 'em dead.

34:01.210 --> 34:03.241
(Pants)

34:03.242 --> 34:06.074
Well, you could've missed.

34:06.075 --> 34:07.616
I never miss.

34:11.280 --> 34:13.381
Early this morning,
Philadelphia police launched

34:13.382 --> 34:16.724
a daring raid to apprehend
Dr. Harvey Wallace,

34:16.725 --> 34:20.228
a man suspected of at
least six serial murders.

34:20.229 --> 34:22.590
Wallace was killed
in the operation,

34:22.591 --> 34:26.264
but police managed to
save the life of his next victim,

34:26.265 --> 34:28.096
army staff sergeant
Karl Simmons,

34:28.097 --> 34:31.469
a veteran of the
war in Afghanistan.

34:31.470 --> 34:34.473
(People speaking indistinctly)

34:42.151 --> 34:48.357
(Starts engine)

34:50.159 --> 34:51.660
(Ship's horn blows)

34:54.092 --> 34:56.364
(Camera shutter clicking)

34:56.365 --> 34:57.825
Congratulations.

34:57.826 --> 35:00.368
I'm impressed.
You saved Karl's life.

35:00.369 --> 35:01.629
Yeah.

35:01.630 --> 35:02.800
(Clicking continues)

35:02.801 --> 35:04.172
I'm giving you a
compliment here,

35:04.173 --> 35:06.804
and not even in
an obnoxious way.

35:06.805 --> 35:08.706
Did Wallace say anything

35:08.707 --> 35:10.808
before you shot him?

35:10.809 --> 35:13.341
The usual. "It wasn't
me, they made me do it."

35:13.342 --> 35:15.413
They? Who's they? I don't know.

35:15.414 --> 35:17.785
Little green men, voices
in his head... who knows?

35:17.786 --> 35:20.548
There's no way one person
could run those machines

35:20.549 --> 35:23.321
and perform surgery
at the same time.

35:23.322 --> 35:25.553
Then there's this.

35:25.554 --> 35:27.255
Surgical mesh.

35:27.256 --> 35:30.428
It's used for organ
repair, not organ removal.

35:30.429 --> 35:31.559
I don't follow.

35:31.560 --> 35:33.231
Why hack up the bodies
to hide the incisions?

35:33.232 --> 35:35.132
What didn't he want us to know?

35:35.133 --> 35:36.804
That he's a lunatic.

35:36.805 --> 35:38.436
Come on, Megan.

35:38.437 --> 35:40.208
For once in your life,
don't overthink this. I...

35:40.209 --> 35:44.173
(Camera shutter clicking)

35:56.154 --> 35:57.825
(Engine revs)

35:57.826 --> 35:59.558
(Tires squeal)

36:02.561 --> 36:04.362
(Cries)

36:04.363 --> 36:06.494
(Coughs and whimpers)

36:06.495 --> 36:07.695
Ah!

36:07.696 --> 36:09.397
(Grunts)

36:09.398 --> 36:11.869
(Crying) Stop! No! Stop!

36:11.870 --> 36:13.741
Don't worry.

36:13.742 --> 36:15.172
(Continues crying)

36:15.173 --> 36:17.445
You won't feel a thing.

36:17.446 --> 36:19.278
(Crying stops)

36:23.212 --> 36:24.352
(Elevator bell dings)

36:24.353 --> 36:27.256
(Indistinct conversations)

36:29.218 --> 36:30.388
Hey, Dr. Hunt.

36:30.389 --> 36:32.220
I finally identified
that foreign matter

36:32.221 --> 36:34.222
you removed from the
wall of the retroperitoneum.

36:34.223 --> 36:35.323
It's poly...

36:35.324 --> 36:36.464
Polytetrafluoroethylene.

36:36.465 --> 36:37.925
Why do you always do that?

36:37.926 --> 36:41.229
I mean, can't you just let
me give you the answer one...

36:41.230 --> 36:43.471
Okay. I get it.

36:43.472 --> 36:45.833
You know, but why use
surgical mesh to remove organs?

36:45.834 --> 36:50.438
And why were they
saturated in potassium?

36:50.439 --> 36:51.579
Doesn't make any sense.

36:51.580 --> 36:53.711
What?

36:53.712 --> 36:55.714
What is it, this? What?

36:57.816 --> 36:59.517
Well, thank you for the
congratulations, Dan,

36:59.518 --> 37:01.389
but it was my team, not me.

37:01.390 --> 37:04.952
A statement? Yeah, I think i'm
way ahead of you on that one.

37:04.953 --> 37:06.454
Well, let's just
say if you tune in

37:06.455 --> 37:07.925
in about 15 minutes,

37:07.926 --> 37:09.727
you'll see what shining
on camera looks like.

37:09.728 --> 37:11.399
All right. Bye.

37:11.400 --> 37:13.401
I strongly advise you
not to talk to the press

37:13.402 --> 37:15.863
until we find out what's
happening with those bodies.

37:15.864 --> 37:17.365
(Indistinct conversations)

37:17.366 --> 37:19.567
Okay, the police got their man.

37:19.568 --> 37:21.369
You performed lifesaving
emergency surgery

37:21.370 --> 37:22.870
on his next victim.

37:22.871 --> 37:24.512
The press is beating
down my door.

37:24.513 --> 37:26.244
What else could be happening?

37:27.416 --> 37:28.776
Surgical mesh.

37:28.777 --> 37:30.478
Their spleens were removed

37:30.479 --> 37:33.250
so something else could
be put in their place...

37:33.251 --> 37:34.752
Something requiring
surgical mesh

37:34.753 --> 37:36.754
to attach it to the
abdominal wall,

37:36.755 --> 37:38.756
something that leaked potassium

37:38.757 --> 37:40.658
in high enough
levels to kill them.

37:40.659 --> 37:43.331
I checked. They
all had high levels.

37:43.332 --> 37:44.762
Okay, you know
that potassium levels

37:44.763 --> 37:46.394
spike after death.

37:46.395 --> 37:49.297
That's why it's so hard to
tell if somebody dies from it.

37:49.298 --> 37:50.838
(Knock on door)

37:50.839 --> 37:52.500
Dr. Murphy, they're
ready whenever you are.

37:52.501 --> 37:53.702
Thank you.

37:55.804 --> 37:57.705
Kate, come on.

37:57.706 --> 38:00.778
Are you that eager to get
in front of the cameras?

38:00.779 --> 38:03.511
You're a doctor.
You're not a politician.

38:03.512 --> 38:05.453
It's not that black-and-white.

38:05.454 --> 38:07.055
Yes, it is.

38:08.457 --> 38:10.057
Peter's death...

38:10.058 --> 38:13.421
Affected all of us in
different ways, okay?

38:13.422 --> 38:15.993
I love my job. I'm
proud of what I do.

38:15.994 --> 38:17.495
But is there more
for me out there?

38:17.496 --> 38:19.727
Could I contribute
in a bigger way?

38:19.728 --> 38:21.069
I think so.

38:24.973 --> 38:26.835
You're running for office.

38:30.379 --> 38:32.480
Do you have any solid proof

38:32.481 --> 38:34.382
that this guy was sewing
something into the bodies?

38:34.383 --> 38:35.543
You're holding it.

38:35.544 --> 38:37.515
Okay. Then I think I'm
on pretty solid ground.

38:37.516 --> 38:40.819
They died when a madman
slit their throats. Case closed.

38:46.395 --> 38:49.326
The other body.

38:49.327 --> 38:50.498
Thank you.

38:50.499 --> 38:51.829
I've prepared a brief statement,

38:51.830 --> 38:54.402
and afterward, I will open
it up for your questions.

38:54.403 --> 38:55.703
(Camera shutter clicks)

38:55.704 --> 38:57.765
Recent media reports have
focused on the discovery

38:57.766 --> 39:00.508
of multiple bodies
of combat veterans

39:00.509 --> 39:03.511
who apparently fell
victim to a serial killer.

39:03.512 --> 39:07.044
Needless to say, this has
been my office's highest priority

39:07.045 --> 39:08.746
since the discovery was made.

39:08.747 --> 39:11.018
And I am proud to announce
that, with the cooperation

39:11.019 --> 39:13.421
of the Philadelphia
police department,

39:13.422 --> 39:16.724
the killer has been identified
as a Dr. Harvey Wallace,

39:16.725 --> 39:18.426
who perished in a
shootout with police

39:18.427 --> 39:20.788
before he was able
to kill his next victim.

39:20.789 --> 39:22.630
That victim, by
the way, is alive

39:22.631 --> 39:24.632
and recovering from his wounds

39:24.633 --> 39:27.435
thanks to the efforts of
members of this office.

39:27.436 --> 39:32.139
We mourn the deaths
of Dr. Wallace's victims.

39:32.140 --> 39:34.542
But mourning them isn't enough.

39:34.543 --> 39:37.505
I personally call on our
veterans administration

39:37.506 --> 39:40.077
and our local members
of congress to do more

39:40.078 --> 39:43.551
to safeguard our brave soldiers
lucky enough to return alive

39:43.552 --> 39:45.413
from the field of battle.

39:45.414 --> 39:46.984
Thank you very much.

39:46.985 --> 39:48.155
(Camera shutters clicking)

39:48.156 --> 39:49.487
(Woman) Dr. Murphy.

39:49.488 --> 39:50.488
(Woman) Yes.

39:52.390 --> 39:54.391
(Ethan speaks indistinctly)

39:54.392 --> 39:58.796
You missed another
rousing press conference.

39:58.797 --> 40:00.428
Who's that?

40:00.429 --> 40:03.130
Dr. Wallace's last victim.

40:03.131 --> 40:04.872
You need help?

40:04.873 --> 40:06.404
I got it.

40:51.119 --> 40:53.922
(Whispers) Oh, my god.

40:56.955 --> 40:58.927
(Grunts)

41:07.836 --> 41:11.239
Bomb?

41:13.171 --> 41:16.173
(Cell phone rings)

41:16.174 --> 41:19.176
(Ring)

41:19.177 --> 41:20.478
(Instrument clatters)

41:22.681 --> 41:24.081
(Ring)

41:24.082 --> 41:25.613
(Sighs)

41:25.614 --> 41:27.184
Hey, lace.

41:27.185 --> 41:29.186
(Distorted male voice) Dr. Hunt?

41:29.187 --> 41:30.758
Who is this?

41:30.759 --> 41:32.960
You've stuck your nose
where it doesn't belong.

41:32.961 --> 41:34.522
Now I've got your daughter,

41:34.523 --> 41:38.496
and you're gonna do exactly
what I say or else she dies.
