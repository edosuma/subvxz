<i>Crime fighting gets an upgrade</i>

00:03.838 --> 00:05.838
- So, are you impressed?
- Wow.

00:05.840 --> 00:08.674
<i>Catch all-new episodes mondays.</i>
<i>And check out our</i>

00:08.676 --> 00:11.810
Bones, sleepy hollow

00:11.812 --> 00:14.546
- Why does it need to be you?
- I'm the only one I can trust.

00:14.548 --> 00:15.748
<i>Only on fox.</i>

00:16.951 --> 00:18.450
<i>A Maverick billionaire...</i>

00:18.452 --> 00:20.352
<i>My name is gideon Reeves.</i>

00:20.354 --> 00:24.156
<i>I built an empire making
rockets, computers, robots...</i>

00:24.158 --> 00:26.125
<i>Made over $100 billion.</i>

00:26.127 --> 00:27.226
<i>Know how I did it?</i>

00:27.228 --> 00:29.028
I'm an engineer.

00:29.030 --> 00:30.863
<i>...Touched by tragedy...</i>

00:30.865 --> 00:33.065
The money!
- No!

00:33.067 --> 00:34.666
<i>My friend has been shot!</i>

00:34.668 --> 00:36.535
Where the hell are you people?!

00:40.474 --> 00:41.874
I want justice
for Elliot James Sully.

00:41.876 --> 00:44.643
Give me the 13th district
to run.

00:44.645 --> 00:47.246
A civilian can't take over
a police district.

00:47.248 --> 00:49.214
They can, with a special
appointment from this committee.

00:49.216 --> 00:52.484
<i>...To revolutionize
a police force...</i>

00:52.486 --> 00:54.553
Technology doesn't
solve cases, cops do.

00:54.555 --> 00:56.155
You haven't met
my technology.

01:00.061 --> 01:01.060
Wow.

01:01.062 --> 01:02.761
<i>...And save a city.</i>

01:02.763 --> 01:05.230
You guys are my partners.

01:05.232 --> 01:06.465
We're gonna change the world.

01:07.601 --> 01:10.069
<i>No, first you make me dinner,</i>

01:10.071 --> 01:12.738
<i>then we get comfortable.</i>

01:12.740 --> 01:15.040
Yeah, I'll be over in a second.

01:15.042 --> 01:16.442
Uh-huh.

01:16.444 --> 01:18.343
Okay. Love you, too.

01:18.345 --> 01:19.912
All right, bye.

02:06.660 --> 02:08.092
The mayor's
office asked me

02:08.095 --> 02:10.662
to do a comprehensive legal
review of all of your cases.

02:10.663 --> 02:12.664
I have to say, I see
a lot of problems there.

02:12.666 --> 02:14.399
No. Check the paper.
Did you mean a lot of success?

02:14.401 --> 02:16.068
Crime is down
across the district.

02:16.070 --> 02:17.269
It's true.

02:17.271 --> 02:18.971
We're down eight percent.
Well, anybody can

02:18.973 --> 02:20.906
generate good numbers
if they want to break the rules.

02:20.908 --> 02:22.774
Break the rules?
How are we br... what?

02:22.776 --> 02:24.009
Did you even consult a lawyer

02:24.011 --> 02:25.744
before you shot a man
with a drone?

02:25.746 --> 02:27.779
Or before you set up
a completely unorthodox

02:27.781 --> 02:28.847
surveillance system?

02:28.849 --> 02:31.283
We're doing things better.

02:31.285 --> 02:33.452
We're making the city safer.

02:33.454 --> 02:35.020
Safer. Oh.

02:35.022 --> 02:37.122
What about the giant
explosion in the middle

02:37.124 --> 02:38.457
of the city last week?

02:38.459 --> 02:39.858
Was that safer?

02:39.860 --> 02:42.161
That's a matter of perspective.

02:42.163 --> 02:43.529
Hmm.
- Look,

02:43.531 --> 02:47.032
we both know that this is
as much about the fact

02:47.034 --> 02:49.668
that your ex-wife works here
than it is about

02:49.670 --> 02:51.703
anything that I'm doing.

02:51.705 --> 02:53.772
My marriage has nothing
to do with this.

02:55.509 --> 02:57.543
This is about your blatant
disregard for the law.

02:57.545 --> 02:59.545
Oh, and, Mr. Reeves,

02:59.547 --> 03:02.047
I'll see you at the
mayor's office on Thursday.

03:02.049 --> 03:04.783
We'll determine which of
those cases will be dismissed.

03:04.785 --> 03:06.885
I suggest you come prepared.

03:10.324 --> 03:12.958
Oh, you've stepped
in it now.

03:14.728 --> 03:16.228
I just... oh, my...

03:16.230 --> 03:17.663
This is...

03:17.665 --> 03:19.298
They're seriously
gonna let bad guys go

03:19.300 --> 03:20.566
for the sake of politics?

03:22.703 --> 03:25.704
You embarrassed the mayor
when you took over the district.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.339
He wants payback.

03:27.341 --> 03:30.008
I've been around a long time,
and I'm telling you

03:30.010 --> 03:32.411
there's only one way out
of a situation like this.

03:32.413 --> 03:33.845
Is it a killer robot?

03:33.847 --> 03:36.081
Tell me it's a killer robot.
I'll build one.

03:36.083 --> 03:38.650
No. Bottom line is,
we need a win.

03:38.652 --> 03:41.720
Something big enough
that the Asa and the mayor

03:41.722 --> 03:44.790
can't take the political hit
and use it against us.

03:54.868 --> 03:56.935
Yeah, he didn't
take anything.

03:56.937 --> 03:59.905
Seems crazy. I mean, what's
a guy like that thinking?

03:59.907 --> 04:02.574
Yo, gideon, we
need your help.

04:02.576 --> 04:05.077
Boy, if I had a dollar
for every time I heard that,

04:05.079 --> 04:06.945
I'd be a... oh, that's right.
I already am.

04:06.947 --> 04:08.847
Got a case that
came in last night.

04:08.849 --> 04:10.215
A weird one.
- Yeah.

04:10.217 --> 04:13.885
Some nutjob shot up an atm
last night about 8:00.

04:13.887 --> 04:15.454
Alarm goes off, we respond.

04:15.456 --> 04:16.688
He's just standing there,

04:16.690 --> 04:20.024
waiting, gun on
the ground, hands up.

04:20.027 --> 04:22.127
All right,
don't take this the wrong way.

04:22.129 --> 04:24.062
Sounds like a case
where you <i> don't</i> need my help.

04:24.064 --> 04:26.231
- I think he did it.
- Yeah, we got that.

04:26.233 --> 04:29.534
The thing is, he says he was
trying to get our attention,

04:29.536 --> 04:31.370
'cause he needs to talk to you.

04:31.372 --> 04:33.372
He made
over 50 apb calls,

04:33.374 --> 04:34.706
but they all got dispatched
to the 21st district.

04:34.708 --> 04:36.642
They ignored 'em.
He called here

04:36.644 --> 04:39.778
a bunch, too, but the desk
wouldn't connect him.

04:39.780 --> 04:41.113
Guess he figured
committing a crime

04:41.115 --> 04:43.015
in the 13th was
the only way.

04:49.723 --> 04:51.723
Mr. Reeves.

04:51.725 --> 04:53.158
Thanks for coming.

04:53.160 --> 04:54.826
Hello.

04:54.828 --> 04:56.395
Mr. Reeves, you've been
an inspiration to me.

04:56.397 --> 04:57.396
Oh.

04:57.398 --> 04:59.431
Um...

04:59.433 --> 05:01.466
An inspiration to shoot an atm?

05:02.903 --> 05:06.772
Yeah, I'm, uh... I'm sorry
about that. I just, um...

05:06.774 --> 05:08.573
I just didn't
know what to do.
- Okay.

05:08.575 --> 05:11.943
Then why exactly
did you need to talk to me?

05:11.945 --> 05:15.647
Well, it's my daughter, Maya.

05:15.649 --> 05:19.318
She was a student
at the university of Chicago.

05:19.320 --> 05:22.154
And last year, she started
to experiment with drugs.

05:22.156 --> 05:24.189
And we tried
to intervene,

05:24.191 --> 05:26.191
but, uh, she
had a stroke.

05:26.193 --> 05:27.793
She survived,

05:27.795 --> 05:29.928
but she's just, um...

05:29.930 --> 05:32.030
She's learning
how to talk again.

05:32.032 --> 05:34.766
I'm so sorry. Um, uh...

05:34.768 --> 05:36.702
I still don't understand,
though. Why...

05:36.704 --> 05:38.770
I just felt like I
had to do something.

05:38.772 --> 05:40.439
Right?

05:40.441 --> 05:42.374
She o.D.'D on a drug
called hi-town.

05:42.376 --> 05:45.310
It's a synthetic heroin
and methamphetamine.

05:45.312 --> 05:47.713
The doctors said that
that particular combination

05:47.715 --> 05:50.182
causes accidental overdoses
all the time.

05:50.184 --> 05:51.483
Yeah, it's true.

05:51.485 --> 05:53.352
The meth keeps the kids up
and doing more.

05:53.354 --> 05:56.221
The opiates kick in,
knocks 'em to their knees,

05:56.223 --> 05:58.657
but no one's sure who deals it.
And that's what I
wanted to find out.

05:58.659 --> 06:01.793
I want to stop the guy who
gave this drug to my daughter

06:01.795 --> 06:04.563
before he hurts
someone else's kid.

06:04.565 --> 06:07.332
And then I saw what you
did for your friend,

06:07.334 --> 06:09.501
and how you
found his killer.

06:09.503 --> 06:11.570
I went to mit, too.

06:11.572 --> 06:13.905
Class of '90.

06:13.907 --> 06:16.174
I don't know. I
guess I just, um...

06:16.176 --> 06:18.176
Wanted to do the same thing.

06:18.178 --> 06:20.412
Yeah. I'm not quite
the engineer you are,

06:20.414 --> 06:22.481
certainly not
a billionaire.

06:22.483 --> 06:24.716
All I got for my
trouble was a-a beating

06:24.718 --> 06:26.551
from some
street dealers.

06:26.553 --> 06:28.987
Look, I know I'm gonna go to
prison for what I did yesterday.

06:28.989 --> 06:31.823
I'm okay with that,
but I, um, uh...

06:31.825 --> 06:34.259
I'm asking you, please,
just-just go to my home.

06:34.261 --> 06:37.996
I've got files.
I've got evidence.

06:37.998 --> 06:41.566
Just please,
just take a look.

06:44.171 --> 06:46.605
Rookie, you write
this many moving violations,

06:46.607 --> 06:49.074
I'll give you
a police medal myself.

06:49.076 --> 06:51.443
Don't. Don't
encourage him, Bernie.

06:51.445 --> 06:52.844
Come on.
What was that?

06:52.846 --> 06:55.113
What was what? I was
getting us ticket books.

06:55.115 --> 06:57.716
You take four,
they expect you to fill four.

06:57.718 --> 06:59.351
Cobb! Reyes!

06:59.353 --> 07:00.919
Yeah.

07:00.921 --> 07:02.854
What beat are you guys
working today?

07:02.856 --> 07:04.122
Uh, we're on
a traffic car.

07:04.124 --> 07:05.624
I have a special
assignment for you.

07:05.626 --> 07:07.526
Our tact team's been
running down some leads

07:07.528 --> 07:10.028
on possible fugitives
in the district.

07:10.030 --> 07:11.630
What do you need us for?

07:11.632 --> 07:13.298
Ada here's got a new way
to skin the cat.

07:13.300 --> 07:15.400
So I programmed a way to cross-
check records and find people

07:15.402 --> 07:17.569
who've been changing aliases to
stay out of federal databases.

07:17.571 --> 07:18.537
Okay.

07:18.539 --> 07:20.138
Well, which means what?

07:21.375 --> 07:23.442
Probable fugitives.
We got a hit in the district,

07:23.444 --> 07:25.811
a Reggie Walker
on 51st and damen.

07:25.813 --> 07:28.747
According to our records,
he's only existed for

07:28.749 --> 07:30.315
the past seven years.

07:30.317 --> 07:32.984
I'm gonna send his info
to your squad car now.

07:32.986 --> 07:34.286
He dangerous?

07:34.288 --> 07:36.321
Yeah, there a chance
this guy eats people or what?

07:36.323 --> 07:39.391
He's not hiding from the FBI
because he's an angel.

07:39.393 --> 07:40.926
Look, I'm gonna level with you.

07:40.928 --> 07:43.328
The district could use
a little good publicity.

07:43.330 --> 07:44.729
You guys reel in a big fish,

07:44.731 --> 07:46.264
it gives the mayor
something to brag about

07:46.266 --> 07:48.600
and leave us all alone.
- Okay.

07:48.602 --> 07:50.335
But if the guy turns out
to be a cannibal,

07:50.337 --> 07:51.570
I'm feeding him
the rookie here first.

07:57.444 --> 07:59.511
<i>Thank you for coming.</i>

07:59.513 --> 08:01.480
I'm so sorry for any
trouble Robert caused.

08:01.482 --> 08:03.515
He didn't tell me what
he was going to do.
Oh, that's all right.

08:03.517 --> 08:06.117
We've all wanted
to shoot an atm at some point.

08:06.119 --> 08:07.819
Is this everything?

08:07.821 --> 08:09.688
Um, I think so, yes.

08:09.690 --> 08:12.357
It was all printed out and
organized just in case you came.

08:12.359 --> 08:15.927
I have to ask... was your husband
ever violent before this?

08:15.929 --> 08:18.363
Oh, God, no. Robert...

08:18.365 --> 08:21.099
He was always in his head,
always inventing things,

08:21.101 --> 08:24.035
and fiddling around on
his computer, and, well...

08:24.037 --> 08:26.638
And the apple didn't
fall far from the tree.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.340
Those are all of Maya's
science fair awards.

08:30.844 --> 08:33.477
We were both so proud. I...

08:33.480 --> 08:36.313
The man who gave
her those drugs...

08:36.316 --> 08:37.549
He broke our
little girl.

08:39.385 --> 08:40.719
Since the stroke,

08:40.721 --> 08:42.153
she hasn't said a word.

08:42.155 --> 08:43.355
I just don't know

08:43.357 --> 08:45.223
how it all went so wrong.

08:45.225 --> 08:47.492
Well...

08:47.494 --> 08:50.195
That's exactly what
we're gonna try to figure out.

08:57.371 --> 08:59.571
<i>Let me just get this straight.</i>

08:59.573 --> 09:01.973
You want to take on
a shot-in-the-dark drug case

09:01.975 --> 09:04.209
for a vigilante now?

09:04.211 --> 09:07.045
Well, there might be
more positive ways of put...

09:07.047 --> 09:08.413
Yeah, that sounds about right.

09:08.415 --> 09:11.149
Look, we found
some evidence from Mr. ruiz.

09:11.151 --> 09:12.584
Not a lot, but he did find

09:12.586 --> 09:14.085
the major points of sale
for hi-town.

09:14.087 --> 09:15.253
I mean, it's a start.

09:15.255 --> 09:17.923
A start? Remember our talk about

09:17.925 --> 09:20.091
doing something to make
us popular at city hall?

09:20.093 --> 09:21.493
Any of that ring a bell?

09:21.495 --> 09:25.230
That sounds familiar, yes,
but this...

09:25.232 --> 09:26.598
People are dying, captain.

09:26.600 --> 09:28.767
This hi-town stuff...
It's poison.

09:28.769 --> 09:30.535
I know that. But Murphy,

09:30.537 --> 09:33.838
you know that trying to hit
a major drug dealer is tough

09:33.840 --> 09:35.273
under the best

09:35.275 --> 09:36.942
of circumstances,
and this is

09:36.944 --> 09:38.944
far from the best circumstances.

09:38.946 --> 09:40.779
Didn't jfk say something

09:40.781 --> 09:42.948
about doing things
because they're hard?

09:42.950 --> 09:44.849
And it didn't end well for him,
either, as I recall.

09:44.851 --> 09:47.452
I said we needed a win,
not an uphill battle.

09:47.454 --> 09:49.621
But how hard can it be?

09:49.623 --> 09:50.956
They're selling the stuff.

09:50.958 --> 09:52.424
Someone has money,
someone has drugs.

09:52.426 --> 09:53.625
They trade the money
for the drugs, and then

09:53.627 --> 09:55.293
we catch somebody,
and then we work our way up.

09:55.295 --> 09:57.128
Oh.

09:57.130 --> 09:58.730
Is that all there is to it?

09:58.732 --> 10:00.732
Murphy, maybe you should

10:00.734 --> 10:04.035
give Mr. Reeves here a little
lesson in the local drug trade.

10:04.037 --> 10:05.837
I'm on it, captain.

10:13.747 --> 10:15.747
<i>Seriously, I don't see</i>

10:15.749 --> 10:17.282
why this is necessary.

10:17.284 --> 10:19.818
I know. That's
why we're here.

10:19.820 --> 10:22.220
What are we even
looking for, urban blight?

10:22.222 --> 10:23.455
Yeah, I-I see it.

10:23.457 --> 10:24.756
It's-it's an American tragedy.

10:24.758 --> 10:27.292
Can you just shut up?

10:27.294 --> 10:28.627
All right, right there.

10:28.629 --> 10:29.761
That car...

10:29.763 --> 10:32.130
That's the buyer.

10:32.132 --> 10:33.398
How can you tell?

10:33.400 --> 10:34.933
'Cause she's not driving
five Miles an hour

10:34.935 --> 10:37.335
just to take in the
beautiful scenery.

10:37.337 --> 10:38.670
Okay, that guy...
He's the lookout.

10:38.672 --> 10:40.305
<i>He watches out for the cops.</i>

10:40.307 --> 10:42.173
And that one
right there...

10:42.175 --> 10:44.275
He steers the buyer
to the banker.

10:45.278 --> 10:47.145
That's the banker?

10:47.147 --> 10:50.448
<i>That's quite a title for a guy
with such ill-fitting pants.</i>

10:50.450 --> 10:52.817
<i>The banker never touches
the drugs, just the money.</i>

10:53.820 --> 10:55.887
That's the slinger.

10:57.691 --> 10:59.557
He handles the drugs.

11:03.664 --> 11:05.664
What is he, 12?

11:05.666 --> 11:07.265
Probably younger.

11:07.267 --> 11:09.601
Okay. So now who
do you arrest?

11:09.603 --> 11:12.303
The banker for taking cash
from a guy at a car?

11:12.305 --> 11:13.972
Or the little kid with
$30 worth of drugs?

11:13.974 --> 11:15.473
Well, there has
to be more drugs.

11:15.475 --> 11:17.008
Sure, under a rock
somewhere in this lot.

11:17.010 --> 11:18.677
Even if you do
manage an arrest,

11:18.679 --> 11:21.046
good luck getting any
of these guys to talk.

11:21.048 --> 11:23.181
Those guys aren't afraid
of jail. They're planning on it.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.517
There has to be some connection
to the higher-ups,

11:25.519 --> 11:26.885
some way...
They're not here.

11:26.887 --> 11:28.486
They're at home,
counting their cash.

11:32.059 --> 11:33.725
But they do touch the cash.

11:33.727 --> 11:37.095
Yeah. But, I mean, good luck
trying to trace it back to them.

11:39.232 --> 11:41.066
All right, challenge accepted.

11:46.339 --> 11:50.008
Says here Mr. Reggie Walker
lives in number 2.

11:50.010 --> 11:51.810
Sounds about right.

11:51.812 --> 11:54.579
So we really don't have
any idea what this guy did?

11:54.581 --> 11:56.581
No. Just that he's living
under a fake name.

11:56.583 --> 11:58.883
The idea is we're gonna
find the guy, talk to him,

11:58.885 --> 12:00.151
find out what he's done.

12:00.153 --> 12:02.087
Or we'll just find out
that the guy's got

12:02.089 --> 12:03.421
a typo on his driver's license.

12:03.423 --> 12:05.757
I don't know.
Looks pretty official to me.

12:05.759 --> 12:08.526
Yeah. So did the warrant
that I had to serve

12:08.528 --> 12:11.496
on a six-year-old last year
for reckless driving.

12:11.498 --> 12:13.898
Trust me, nothing screws
up like a computer.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.700
We're not gonna find
any bad guys.

12:15.702 --> 12:17.268
Mr. Walker!

12:18.872 --> 12:21.372
Reggie Walker! Cpd!

12:21.374 --> 12:23.374
We got a workplace listed.
We could check that out.

12:23.376 --> 12:24.943
Shut up.
Hey, just 'cause I'm new...

12:24.945 --> 12:25.944
No, shut up.

12:25.946 --> 12:27.078
Do you hear that?

12:33.553 --> 12:34.619
No! Stop!

12:34.621 --> 12:35.620
Stop!

12:35.622 --> 12:36.755
Police!

12:37.290 --> 12:38.556
1312 emergency.

12:38.558 --> 12:40.391
Black male, white t-shirt,
blue jeans,

12:40.393 --> 12:41.626
heading southbound
on damen.

12:44.097 --> 12:46.064
Suspect is crossing 51st!

13:00.147 --> 13:04.149
1312, uh, we lost him
down the alley by 52nd.

13:05.152 --> 13:07.385
Sure looked like
a bad guy to me.

13:08.922 --> 13:10.822
I've been going through the
stuff that we got from ruiz.

13:10.824 --> 13:12.824
He's been able to ID some
of the smaller dealers,

13:12.826 --> 13:15.059
but there's nothing we can
really build a case on.

13:15.061 --> 13:16.561
Well, as long as we know
who's selling,

13:16.563 --> 13:18.830
I think we're
in business.

13:18.832 --> 13:22.333
So you said the higher-ups
aren't touching the drugs,

13:22.335 --> 13:24.169
but the cash finds
its way to them.

13:24.171 --> 13:25.170
Yeah, but, I mean...

13:25.172 --> 13:26.671
All right, Pete,
show her the money.

13:26.673 --> 13:28.339
Mm-hmm.

13:28.341 --> 13:31.676
So, the idea...

13:31.678 --> 13:35.113
Is to dust each bill

13:35.115 --> 13:37.182
with this ultra-fine
tracing powder.

13:38.685 --> 13:40.018
That way,

13:40.020 --> 13:42.353
anyone who touches the money
will also get

13:42.355 --> 13:43.354
the dust on themselves.

13:43.356 --> 13:44.756
And then
we trace the cash,

13:44.758 --> 13:46.791
figure out exactly
where it's going.

13:46.793 --> 13:50.195
Yeah, I get it. I mean, trace
powder's been around for years.

13:50.197 --> 13:51.629
We can't exactly put
the whole entire district

13:51.631 --> 13:53.198
under a black light.
Don't need to.

13:53.200 --> 13:55.133
You don't see this powder
with a black light.

13:55.135 --> 13:58.169
You see it with these.

14:00.207 --> 14:01.806
Goggles?
- No.

14:01.808 --> 14:04.943
Augmented reality glasses,

14:04.945 --> 14:06.878
thank you very much.
We use them

14:06.880 --> 14:07.979
in materials science

14:07.981 --> 14:09.647
to check for uv radiation leak.

14:09.649 --> 14:12.717
But, as in most cases, I have
something much cooler in mind.

14:12.719 --> 14:13.785
Try those on.

14:16.723 --> 14:18.790
Cool. Now,
that camera

14:18.792 --> 14:20.825
right there picks up
light wavelengths

14:20.827 --> 14:22.827
that your eye
can't see.

14:22.829 --> 14:26.731
And we process
the image

14:26.733 --> 14:30.535
and project it
into the goggles.

14:31.571 --> 14:32.637
Wow.

14:37.677 --> 14:39.477
What do you think?

14:41.248 --> 14:44.649
I think we're gonna catch
some bad guys.

14:45.585 --> 14:47.252
<i>All right,</i>

14:47.254 --> 14:48.586
listen up.

14:48.588 --> 14:50.822
Our c.I.S are out
now, buying hi-town

14:50.824 --> 14:53.191
from all the known drug
dealers in the district.

14:53.193 --> 14:55.593
I want everyone to remember
we are just surveilling.

14:55.595 --> 14:57.929
No arrests, no chasing,

14:57.931 --> 15:01.599
nothing to interrupt the
normal flow of business.

15:01.601 --> 15:04.402
So, we see some scumbag
just out in the open selling,

15:04.404 --> 15:06.437
they're supposed to get a pass?

15:06.439 --> 15:07.939
Right now, we're just
after the big fish.

15:07.941 --> 15:11.342
Our job is to watch and learn,
with these.

15:11.344 --> 15:13.344
I don't need those.

15:13.346 --> 15:16.948
You do, because they're
gonna be feeding data

15:16.950 --> 15:18.950
back to the station.

15:18.952 --> 15:21.853
The more that you guys see,
the more that we learn.

15:21.855 --> 15:22.921
And the closer we get

15:22.923 --> 15:23.922
to putting a heartless

15:23.924 --> 15:25.189
son of a bitch out of business.

15:27.294 --> 15:29.294
They're serious
with these things?

15:29.296 --> 15:30.762
Yeah.

15:37.470 --> 15:38.836
Do I look like Bono
in these?

15:39.973 --> 15:41.773
Not even in your wildest dreams.

15:44.244 --> 15:46.978
Uh, hey, squad, 1305.

15:46.980 --> 15:48.646
I am wearing
the glasses.

15:48.648 --> 15:49.981
<i>There a problem?</i>

15:49.983 --> 15:51.983
<i>Just not seeing
anything special.</i>

15:51.985 --> 15:53.318
<i>Think they're broken.</i>

15:53.320 --> 15:56.254
Well, try turning
onto Fowler street.

15:56.256 --> 15:58.056
<i>And, ada,</i>

15:58.058 --> 15:59.824
show officer Brandt the light.

15:59.826 --> 16:01.759
Whoa.

16:04.064 --> 16:06.497
Nice.

16:07.834 --> 16:09.500
Are we tripping?

16:09.502 --> 16:11.269
It sure as hell looks like that.

16:11.271 --> 16:13.671

Okay, everybody ready?

16:39.632 --> 16:41.766
We've been gathering data
since the bills went out,

16:41.768 --> 16:43.701
and this is what we've got.

16:43.703 --> 16:47.105
These are all the locations
where the dye has been spotted.

16:47.107 --> 16:49.007
We've narrowed it down
to some major focal points.

16:49.976 --> 16:52.110
Some of these are nightclubs,

16:52.112 --> 16:53.378
where the dealers
are doing business.

16:53.380 --> 16:55.813
Others are flophouses,
where the dealers are crashing.

16:55.815 --> 16:57.648
But it's looking
more and more like

16:57.650 --> 16:59.984
the center of the money
and the headquarters for hi-town

16:59.986 --> 17:01.052
is at this house

17:01.054 --> 17:02.120
in bridgeport.

17:04.790 --> 17:05.890
Who lives there?

17:05.892 --> 17:06.891
Marcos Cruz.

17:06.893 --> 17:08.960
Priors for possession.

17:08.962 --> 17:11.863
Indicted twice for drug
trafficking, never convicted.

17:14.300 --> 17:16.901
Ladies and gentlemen,

17:16.903 --> 17:17.969
we have a loser.

17:28.181 --> 17:30.181
Uh, Mr. ruiz.

17:30.183 --> 17:33.017
So I have some news.

17:33.019 --> 17:34.752
We believe we
found the man

17:34.754 --> 17:36.854
who's been selling the drug
that hurt your daughter.

17:36.856 --> 17:40.591
His name is marcos Cruz,
and he's a dealer in bridgeport.

17:40.593 --> 17:42.593
We're planning
the bust now.

17:44.831 --> 17:46.898
I knew, I knew you could do it.

17:46.900 --> 17:48.399
I just, I...

17:48.401 --> 17:50.401
I knew it.

17:50.403 --> 17:52.437
Mr. Reeves, you have no idea
what it's like

17:52.439 --> 17:54.939
when the police tell you that
there's nothing they can do.

17:54.941 --> 17:57.942
Oh, don't be too hard on them.
You know, it's a tough job.

17:57.944 --> 18:00.845
So, I also want
to talk about you.

18:00.847 --> 18:04.615
Um, cook county savings
is very upset about their atm.

18:04.617 --> 18:07.185
What I did was
wrong. I just...

18:07.187 --> 18:08.586
I didn't know
what else to do.

18:08.588 --> 18:10.955
Well, it helps that
you didn't steal any money.

18:10.957 --> 18:14.792
Also helps that I have a, uh,
very large account there, so...

18:14.794 --> 18:17.361
They're not going to be
pressing any charges.

18:17.363 --> 18:18.362
Really?

18:18.364 --> 18:20.465
Yes. If you pay a fine

18:20.467 --> 18:21.866
and take
an anger management class,

18:21.868 --> 18:25.036
where I guess they...
Teach you not to shoot at atms.

18:25.038 --> 18:28.139
All right, the desk officer
will let you out shortly.

18:28.141 --> 18:29.140
Mr. Reeves,

18:29.142 --> 18:30.975
um, at mit,

18:30.977 --> 18:33.411
d-did you take, uh, principles
of engineering practice

18:33.413 --> 18:35.313
with Professor vickers?

18:35.315 --> 18:37.482
Of course. First class.

18:37.484 --> 18:39.150
Remember what the Professor
used to say:

18:39.152 --> 18:42.153
Define the problem properly
and the solution...

18:42.155 --> 18:44.155
Will present itself.

18:44.157 --> 18:46.090
Words to live by.

18:46.092 --> 18:47.125
Yeah.

18:47.127 --> 18:49.093
I was beginning
to lose faith in that.

18:49.095 --> 18:51.295
So, thank you.

19:01.341 --> 19:03.841
We got
the search warrant.

19:03.843 --> 19:05.143
Tact team's
suiting up now.

19:05.145 --> 19:07.512
Well, then I believe
we have a drug dealer to arrest.

19:07.514 --> 19:08.646
Shall we?

19:13.920 --> 19:17.121
So this is Reggie Walker's
place of employment?

19:17.123 --> 19:19.924
What kind of criminal
works at a medical clinic?

19:19.926 --> 19:21.993
Well, I'm just guessing here,
but, you know,

19:21.995 --> 19:23.661
probably the kind
that steals drugs.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.196
Did you graduate
from the academy

19:25.198 --> 19:26.364
or am I just being punk'd?

19:26.366 --> 19:27.365
Well, actually,
at the academy,

19:27.367 --> 19:29.367
they told us
to explore every theory.

19:29.369 --> 19:31.435
Well, I'm gonna give you
a little lesson

19:31.437 --> 19:32.770
that you-you didn't
pick up there.

19:32.772 --> 19:34.705
It's called
how my dad died, okay?

19:34.707 --> 19:36.274
He was in a nursing home.

19:36.276 --> 19:38.376
It was, like, about
a half-step up from this one.

19:38.378 --> 19:41.112
And that was all
I could afford.

19:41.114 --> 19:42.547
Place was a scam, basically.

19:42.549 --> 19:44.382
They'd just stick people
in beds to die,

19:44.384 --> 19:46.217
while the staff got high
in the back.

19:46.219 --> 19:49.020
Pops died of an infection
within six months.

19:50.523 --> 19:53.324
There's a special place in hell
for people who prey on the sick.

19:53.326 --> 19:56.360
And I think that this son
of a bitch is gonna burn in it.

19:58.331 --> 20:00.898
<i>Uh, this is a copy
of Reggie's work ID.</i>

20:00.900 --> 20:03.634
Uh, it's the only photo
we have.

20:03.636 --> 20:05.136
He mostly kept
to himself.

20:05.138 --> 20:07.171
We were really surprised
he didn't come in today.

20:07.173 --> 20:08.673
I don't think he's ever
missed a day of work.

20:08.675 --> 20:10.007
Well, we think
he might have fled.

20:10.009 --> 20:11.309
Do you know
where he might be?

20:11.311 --> 20:12.910
Not really.

20:12.912 --> 20:14.579
I think he's from Texas.

20:14.581 --> 20:15.980
Somewhere down South.

20:15.982 --> 20:18.416
Uh, you know, he was
kind of a quiet type, so...

20:18.418 --> 20:19.984
Yeah, I bet he was.

20:19.986 --> 20:23.254
Okay, uh, well,
if you can think of anything,

20:23.256 --> 20:24.689
just give us a call.

20:24.691 --> 20:26.691
You know, actually,
there's one thing.

20:26.693 --> 20:28.726
He used to feed the homeless
down under the "l"

20:28.728 --> 20:31.262
at, uh, Douglas park,
uh, three times a week.

20:31.264 --> 20:33.598
Good to know.

20:33.600 --> 20:35.433
Thank you.

20:35.435 --> 20:37.935
Hey, do you think
that's something?

20:37.937 --> 20:40.238
Do I think it's something?
Yes, I think it's something.

20:40.240 --> 20:41.839
There are drug addicts
in Douglas park,

20:41.841 --> 20:43.341
to whom he might be
selling drugs.

20:43.343 --> 20:47.011
Have you ever just, like,
watched a cop show on TV?

20:47.013 --> 20:48.512
Anything? Nothing?

20:49.682 --> 20:52.283
Let's stay safe
and secure the house

20:52.285 --> 20:54.018
as quickly as we can.
I don't want any drugs

20:54.020 --> 20:55.553
going down the toilet
or the garbage disposal.

20:55.555 --> 20:58.289
<i>And make sure
that the tact team is briefed</i>

20:58.291 --> 20:59.557
<i>on the breaching device.</i>

20:59.559 --> 21:01.359
All right? That
thing packs a punch.

21:01.361 --> 21:03.628
<i>Don't worry. We're gonna
play nice with your toys.</i>

21:03.630 --> 21:05.696
<i>Okay, let's do this.</i>

21:23.650 --> 21:24.649
Fire in the hole!

21:24.651 --> 21:26.050
Breaching! Clear!

21:31.557 --> 21:33.491
<i>Chicago police!</i>

21:33.493 --> 21:34.492
<i>Upstairs clear!</i>

21:34.494 --> 21:35.626
<i>Kitchen clear!</i>

21:40.500 --> 21:42.099
Get your hands up!

21:42.101 --> 21:43.567
Hands where I can see them!
I'm unarmed.

21:43.569 --> 21:45.102
Get on the ground!

21:45.104 --> 21:47.238
Go ahead, get
on the ground.

21:49.842 --> 21:51.008
Get...

21:51.010 --> 21:52.943
On the ground.

21:52.945 --> 21:54.578
<i>Now!</i>

21:57.150 --> 21:59.417
<i>You know, you're making
a big mistake.</i>

21:59.419 --> 22:00.851
<i>Cuff him.</i>

22:00.853 --> 22:02.887
<i>I'm gonna check the house.</i>

22:09.095 --> 22:10.528
No hi-town in the house.

22:10.530 --> 22:11.696
Anything here?

22:11.698 --> 22:14.332
Just about to check.

22:15.301 --> 22:17.034
Care to join?

22:37.857 --> 22:39.557
Hey, murph.

22:39.559 --> 22:41.158
<i>Looks like we hit the jackpot.</i>

22:41.160 --> 22:42.393
<i>How much?</i>

22:42.395 --> 22:44.962
There's 50, 60 kilos.

22:44.964 --> 22:46.063
Whoa.

22:46.065 --> 22:47.965
What's the jail time on that?

22:47.967 --> 22:51.068
I'd say marcos is gonna spend
a long time in a little room.

22:51.070 --> 22:52.470
<i>Detective.</i>

22:54.407 --> 22:56.140
I hope you got a warrant
for that property.

22:56.142 --> 22:57.408
What the hell
are you talking about?

22:57.410 --> 22:58.809
- The shed...
- Ada.

22:58.811 --> 23:00.911
...belongs to my neighbor.
No, that-that...

23:00.913 --> 23:02.646
That can't be right.

23:06.319 --> 23:08.018
No, he's right.

23:08.020 --> 23:10.588
According to the county,
that's across the property line.

23:10.590 --> 23:12.590
<i>So if you see anything in there
you don't like,</i>

23:12.592 --> 23:14.225
you're probably gonna
have to talk to him.

23:17.563 --> 23:19.230
<i>'Cause it ain't mine.</i>

23:23.336 --> 23:26.504
Mr. Murphy, is there any way
you can work with us on this?

23:26.506 --> 23:28.672
We're talking about
a major drug dealer.

23:28.674 --> 23:31.008
Captain, I'm sorry, but
there's nothing I can do here.

23:31.010 --> 23:32.176
The neighbor's 90.

23:32.178 --> 23:33.577
He called the shed

23:33.579 --> 23:36.013
"a little house that showed up
in his backyard one day."

23:36.015 --> 23:37.415
It's on his property,
in his name.

23:37.417 --> 23:39.216
Okay, let me
get this straight.

23:39.218 --> 23:41.619
You think that Mr. Leeds,
in between eating oatmeal

23:41.621 --> 23:44.789
and tending to his giant
collection of old newspapers,

23:44.791 --> 23:48.759
is also Chicago's biggest dealer
of a synthetic designer drug?

23:48.761 --> 23:50.094
Come on, Scott,

23:50.096 --> 23:52.763
are you really gonna get hung up
on a few inches of property?

23:52.765 --> 23:55.132
You know he did it.
Help us out.

23:55.134 --> 23:56.634
Okay, legally there's
nothing we can do here,

23:56.636 --> 23:58.469
because you had no warrant
for Mr. Leeds' property.

23:58.471 --> 23:59.970
He even said the shed is his.

23:59.972 --> 24:01.806
So you're letting marcos walk?

24:01.808 --> 24:03.240
No, no,<i> you're</i> letting him walk,

24:03.242 --> 24:04.809
because you went in there
and you went off half-cocked.

24:04.811 --> 24:06.143
How is this justice?

24:06.145 --> 24:08.112
I know that you want to score
a win with the mayor,

24:08.114 --> 24:09.647
embarrass this district
in front of the city...

24:09.649 --> 24:11.649
He's got you making
false accusations now, too, huh?

24:11.651 --> 24:14.718
Maybe we should stop arguing
and try to find a damn solution.

24:15.488 --> 24:16.821
Like it or not...

24:16.823 --> 24:18.689
And believe me, I don't...

24:19.759 --> 24:20.925
...if Scott needs
a stronger case,

24:20.927 --> 24:22.326
it's up to us

24:22.328 --> 24:23.561
to give it to him.

24:28.668 --> 24:30.634
I can't believe this.

24:30.636 --> 24:32.770
I just, I can't believe it.

24:32.772 --> 24:34.004
He had the drugs.

24:34.006 --> 24:35.172
Well, and he knew

24:35.174 --> 24:36.774
how to work the system,
you know?

24:36.776 --> 24:38.342
Use our rules against us.

24:38.344 --> 24:40.478
I'm afraid that...

24:40.480 --> 24:44.315
The law is not engineered
to catch guys like marcos Cruz.

24:45.918 --> 24:47.751
So this is all for nothing.

24:47.753 --> 24:49.753
Hey, we're
not giving up.

24:49.755 --> 24:51.322
But for now, uh...

24:51.324 --> 24:53.023
You did what you could.

24:53.025 --> 24:54.692
Thank you.

25:14.213 --> 25:16.280
Unbelievable.

25:16.282 --> 25:17.648
What?

25:17.650 --> 25:19.550
Any decent person

25:19.552 --> 25:21.952
looks around here,
they see a tragedy, right?

25:21.954 --> 25:24.321
And then there's
Reggie Walker,

25:24.323 --> 25:26.624
who sees a business opportunity.

25:26.626 --> 25:29.727
Doesn't seem like
the crowd for prescription meds.

25:29.729 --> 25:31.328
Are you kidding me?

25:31.330 --> 25:32.963
If you're sleeping
in a cardboard box

25:32.965 --> 25:35.900
and somebody comes along,
offers you a chemical vacation

25:35.902 --> 25:37.301
from your crappy life,

25:37.303 --> 25:39.303
I don't care what it is,
you're gonna take it.

25:41.507 --> 25:43.240
What do we got here?

25:44.243 --> 25:46.844
This, my friend,
is Reggie Walker

25:46.846 --> 25:48.846
and a big fat dope arrest.

25:48.848 --> 25:51.081
Let's go.

25:51.083 --> 25:53.817
Here you go, man.

26:03.696 --> 26:04.595
Walker?

26:08.768 --> 26:11.669
Yeah, I suggest you stick around
unless you want to get tased.

26:11.671 --> 26:13.370
Please, I didn't do anything.
You didn't do anything?

26:13.372 --> 26:14.538
You're just that
innocent kind of guy

26:14.540 --> 26:16.273
who walks away from
the police, right?

26:16.275 --> 26:17.408
Just check the bag, will you?

26:18.511 --> 26:20.277
What's your name, man?

26:20.279 --> 26:21.712
Reggie Walker.

26:21.714 --> 26:23.380
Your real name, buddy.

26:23.382 --> 26:26.116
We found you
in our database.

26:26.118 --> 26:27.952
My name is Todd Washington.

26:27.954 --> 26:29.453
I'm a physician.

26:29.455 --> 26:31.722
I was indicted in 1995
for stealing medicine.

26:31.724 --> 26:33.791
There it is. See, reyes?
The guy's been dealing.

26:33.793 --> 26:35.025
No, it's not
what you think.

26:35.027 --> 26:37.027
It was expired aids medication.

26:37.029 --> 26:39.029
The hospital was just
gonna throw it away,

26:39.031 --> 26:41.632
so I broke in
and gave them to the patients.

26:41.634 --> 26:43.467
Wait, what?

26:43.469 --> 26:45.302
It's Insulin.

26:45.304 --> 26:47.972
And sandwiches.

26:47.974 --> 26:50.174
I like the ham.

26:51.310 --> 26:53.944
Please, could you just
at least let me finish up here

26:53.946 --> 26:55.212
before you arrest me?

26:55.214 --> 26:56.880
These guys won't get
their meds otherwise.

26:56.882 --> 26:57.982
You mean the evidence.

26:57.984 --> 26:59.316
All right,
check the top pocket...

26:59.318 --> 27:01.352
I've got every last receipt.

27:02.321 --> 27:04.588
Look, I know
what's on my record.

27:04.590 --> 27:06.657
I also know what's not on it.

27:06.659 --> 27:08.759
I'm not a criminal.

27:08.761 --> 27:10.694
I'm just trying
to help people.

27:18.170 --> 27:20.971
Hey, bud, come here.

27:20.973 --> 27:23.007
Mom wants another hug.

27:23.009 --> 27:24.975
Mwah! You have
any more homework?

27:24.977 --> 27:26.076
A little.

27:26.078 --> 27:27.845
All right, well,
why don't you go back,

27:27.847 --> 27:30.247
mm-hmm.
And I want you to work
until you got none.

27:30.249 --> 27:31.548
Okay.

27:32.685 --> 27:35.352
That smile doesn't fool me.
What's wrong?

27:35.354 --> 27:38.055
Nothing. It's just a long day.

27:41.293 --> 27:43.594
It's Scott, okay?

27:43.596 --> 27:45.796
I feel like...
I feel like

27:45.798 --> 27:47.798
he's using his position
to get back at me.

27:47.800 --> 27:49.366
Get back at you how?

27:49.368 --> 27:51.869
By investigating the 13th
for misconduct.

27:51.871 --> 27:54.838
Look, I know it's his job,
I just feel like, I don't know,

27:54.840 --> 27:55.973
he's making it personal.

27:55.975 --> 27:57.708
<i>Qué idiota.</i>

27:57.710 --> 28:00.477
What does gideon

28:00.479 --> 28:02.379
have to say about it?
- Gideon?

28:02.381 --> 28:04.782
You're calling him gideon?

28:04.784 --> 28:06.383
He's not <i> my</i> boss.

28:06.385 --> 28:08.786
Also, he likes my cooking.
That makes us friends.

28:09.722 --> 28:10.788
Well?

28:10.790 --> 28:13.724
Gideon has his own battles
to fight.

28:13.726 --> 28:16.427
Then he's lucky
to have you by his side.

28:17.797 --> 28:19.063
<i>Mi cubanita fuerte.</i>

28:26.072 --> 28:27.504
Detective Murphy.

28:27.506 --> 28:29.640
<i>Detective,
it's Diana ruiz, Robert's wife.</i>

28:29.642 --> 28:30.874
<i>Something's happened.</i>

28:30.876 --> 28:32.676
<i>He went out, left me a message</i>

28:32.678 --> 28:34.144
<i>saying if anything
happened to him</i>

28:34.146 --> 28:35.913
that he loved me,
that I should kiss Maya for him.

28:35.915 --> 28:37.081
<i>Where is he now?</i>

28:37.083 --> 28:38.682
I don't know.
That's why I called.

28:38.684 --> 28:39.917
<i>Okay, I'm on my way.</i>

28:42.054 --> 28:43.220
<i>Murphy.</i>

28:43.222 --> 28:45.756
Gideon, it's me.
We have a problem.

28:45.758 --> 28:47.458
I'll be back.

28:50.062 --> 28:51.395
<i>Thank you so much for coming.</i>

28:51.397 --> 28:54.164
Did he tell you anything else,
anything that might help us?

28:54.166 --> 28:56.066
No. He was in here
before he left.

28:56.068 --> 28:57.434
He was on the computer.

28:57.436 --> 28:59.236
Yes, which is
password-protected.

28:59.238 --> 29:01.271
Can you, I don't
know, hack it?

29:01.273 --> 29:02.840
Well, man as smart as Robert,

29:02.842 --> 29:04.274
that's, uh, not that simple.

29:04.276 --> 29:05.442
Please. I know him.

29:05.444 --> 29:06.610
He was talking
like he's desperate.

29:06.612 --> 29:08.445
We need to do something.

29:08.447 --> 29:09.847
I know, I know, I know that.

29:09.849 --> 29:12.683
C-could I take
this computer?
- Yes.

29:12.685 --> 29:14.451
Ada, I need you to get
down to the station now,

29:14.453 --> 29:16.787
with Pete and,
uh... computers.

29:16.789 --> 29:18.689
Which computers?
All the computers.

29:18.691 --> 29:21.625
I need to bypass some
pretty serious encryption. Go.

29:21.627 --> 29:23.594
Gideon, we let
him out of jail.

29:23.596 --> 29:26.096
If anything happens...
I know. Just drive.

29:34.740 --> 29:37.474
Bernie, my love, can you
connect me to Conrad, please?

29:37.476 --> 29:41.378
<i>Captain's busy.
Something I can do for you?</i>

29:41.380 --> 29:42.913
No. It's-it's important.

29:42.915 --> 29:45.215
He's got us working this
federal fugitive thing.

29:45.217 --> 29:48.152
You want me to leave him
another message?

29:48.154 --> 29:49.486
No, I have to talk to somebody.

29:49.488 --> 29:50.988
Well, you can either schedule
an appointment

29:50.990 --> 29:53.724
to talk with a shrink, or you
can keep talking. I'm all ears.

29:54.560 --> 29:56.160
All right.
The thing is,

29:56.162 --> 29:57.995
we found the guy,
and we-we thought

29:57.997 --> 30:00.264
he was kind of this,
you know, drug trafficker,

30:00.266 --> 30:01.799
but it turns out he was...

30:01.801 --> 30:03.834
He was stealing aids drugs
for poor people.

30:03.836 --> 30:05.169
That's his story?

30:05.171 --> 30:06.837
<i>Yeah. We checked it out.</i>

30:06.839 --> 30:08.939
I mean, he was in Texas,
he hit some hospital,

30:08.941 --> 30:10.440
took, like, 400 grand
worth of meds.

30:10.442 --> 30:12.176
People were dying.
They were just gonna throw

30:12.178 --> 30:13.443
those drugs away...
That's enough.

30:13.445 --> 30:15.646
Anyway, the guy's been
working at this clinic

30:15.648 --> 30:17.247
for, like, ten years.

30:17.249 --> 30:19.516
He's changing bedpans
and stuff, no problems.

30:19.518 --> 30:22.186
I-I guess we can bring
the guy in. It's just...

30:22.188 --> 30:24.254
<i>Captain tell you
to bring him in?</i>

30:25.357 --> 30:26.523
Yes.

30:26.525 --> 30:27.991
Then bring him in.

30:36.635 --> 30:37.968
Just thinking,

30:37.970 --> 30:39.803
I know I'm a rookie
and all, but...

30:39.805 --> 30:41.939
Maybe we should do
a perimeter check.

30:46.545 --> 30:48.745
Good call, rook.

30:50.282 --> 30:52.382
He's running an aes
256-bit. We can't get in

30:52.384 --> 30:54.117
this way unless you have
a friend at the NSA.

30:54.119 --> 30:55.719
Gideon, do you think...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, working on it.

30:55.721 --> 30:59.623
If the front door's locked,
might as well try the back.

30:59.625 --> 31:01.491
There's no fde
on his backup drive,

31:01.493 --> 31:03.794
so a regex scan
of the plaintext,

31:03.796 --> 31:05.562
it might turn up
the crypto-key.
- No.

31:05.564 --> 31:06.797
It might turn up the cryp...

31:06.799 --> 31:08.332
Check it out!
- Okay, fine.

31:08.334 --> 31:09.833
Oh, wait, you're right.

31:09.835 --> 31:11.068
It unlocked the encryption.

31:11.070 --> 31:12.069
Sorry for yelling.

31:12.071 --> 31:13.403
Ooh, yeah, looks like

31:13.405 --> 31:15.405
he got a lot of his information
from us here.

31:15.407 --> 31:16.740
Police scanner.

31:16.742 --> 31:18.075
Probably the smart move.

31:18.077 --> 31:19.476
He also put a tracking device
on Cruz's car.

31:19.478 --> 31:21.912
There's a lot of GPS data here.
Cool.

31:21.914 --> 31:23.914
Put it up on the board.
Okay, this data's a mess.

31:23.916 --> 31:25.682
I'm trying to piece it together.

31:25.684 --> 31:27.684
Well, maybe you should
invent digital duct tape.
"Maybe you should..."

31:27.686 --> 31:29.253
Actually,
that's a pretty good idea.

31:29.255 --> 31:30.420
Okay.

31:30.422 --> 31:31.755
There. That's where
the path stops.

31:31.757 --> 31:32.890
That's where he stopped tracking

31:32.892 --> 31:34.524
and he shut down
around 35 minutes ago.

31:34.526 --> 31:36.660
All right, I'm on it.
Send backup.

31:55.080 --> 31:56.780
The hell is this?

31:56.782 --> 31:59.583
All we know is Robert
tracked marcos' crews here.

31:59.585 --> 32:01.118
He own the place?

32:01.120 --> 32:03.654
No, the city does.
It's condemned.

32:04.890 --> 32:06.957
See those chlorine
containers?

32:06.959 --> 32:08.458
Sure looks like
someone's been using it.

32:08.460 --> 32:10.794
Probably where
they're cooking the junk.

32:10.796 --> 32:13.363
Either that or swimming
in a spacious indoor pool.

32:15.067 --> 32:16.300
We know what Robert drives?

32:16.302 --> 32:18.468
Hybrid, according
to his wife, but...

32:18.470 --> 32:20.804
I don't see one here.

32:20.806 --> 32:21.972
Gideon,

32:21.974 --> 32:23.707
<i>do you want to check out back?</i>
On it.

32:31.884 --> 32:34.484
All righty. I spy

32:34.486 --> 32:36.553
with my hd eye...

32:36.555 --> 32:38.789
There it is.

32:48.100 --> 32:49.967
It's registered to Robert.

32:54.006 --> 32:55.906
There's ammo
in the passenger seat.

32:55.908 --> 32:58.742
Looks like ruiz decided to do
a little amateur cop work.

32:58.744 --> 33:00.277
Damn it.

33:00.279 --> 33:02.346
We got to get in there now.

33:12.291 --> 33:14.024
Oh, hold on, murph.

33:14.026 --> 33:16.259
I mean, you know
I'm up for just about anything,

33:16.261 --> 33:18.362
but it's pitch black.
We don't have the first idea

33:18.364 --> 33:20.197
where anybody is in there.
And we go in

33:20.199 --> 33:21.665
with flashlights,
they'll see us coming.

33:22.634 --> 33:23.967
The glasses.

33:23.969 --> 33:25.602
The ones used
to see the marker dye.

33:25.604 --> 33:26.803
You still have yours?

33:26.805 --> 33:28.472
Yeah.
- Gideon,

33:28.474 --> 33:29.539
<i>those glasses you gave us...</i>

33:29.541 --> 33:30.707
<i>How are they at seeing
in the dark?</i>

33:30.709 --> 33:31.708
Great.

33:31.710 --> 33:32.776
Just-just... just have to

33:32.778 --> 33:33.810
change a few settings.

33:33.812 --> 33:36.279
<i>Okay, make it happen.</i>

34:01.907 --> 34:03.907
You've been on my ass for weeks!

34:03.909 --> 34:05.876
My daughter.
You hurt my daughter.

34:05.878 --> 34:07.377
You blame me for that?

34:07.379 --> 34:09.746
Then you come down here
with this gun,

34:09.748 --> 34:10.981
you try to take me out?

34:10.983 --> 34:14.284
<i>You ever even seen a gun,
old man? Here.</i>

34:14.920 --> 34:17.020
Let me show you.

34:17.022 --> 34:18.255
Police! Don't move!

34:18.257 --> 34:20.157
Back off!
- What the hell?

34:21.092 --> 34:22.859
Let him go, marcos.

34:22.860 --> 34:24.094
That ain't happening.

34:24.096 --> 34:26.329
- Back off or he dies.
- Calm down.

34:26.331 --> 34:28.864
<i>I'll calm down
when you back the hell off.</i>

34:28.867 --> 34:32.002
<i>Gideon, this just turned into
a hostage situation.</i>

34:37.076 --> 34:40.377
Be smart, Cruz.
You ain't walking out of here.

34:40.379 --> 34:41.945
Yeah? We'll see.

34:41.947 --> 34:44.781
Back off or I swear
I'll drop his ass.

34:44.783 --> 34:46.349
Gideon, we need to
do something here.

34:46.351 --> 34:48.685
<i>Calm down, marcos.
Just calm down.</i>

34:48.687 --> 34:50.520
Wait, why can't Brandt
just tase them both?

34:50.522 --> 34:53.723
It's not safe. We need
to call in a hostage negotiator.

34:53.725 --> 34:55.058
How long is
that gonna take?

34:55.060 --> 34:57.127
Half an hour.

34:57.129 --> 34:59.196
My guess is that's about
29 minutes too long.

34:59.198 --> 35:00.297
<i>Please.</i>

35:00.299 --> 35:02.032
Don't put yourself
in danger for me.

35:02.034 --> 35:03.200
This is my fight.

35:03.202 --> 35:04.634
Yeah.

35:04.636 --> 35:06.269
Maybe you should
listen to him.

35:06.271 --> 35:07.471
How about this:

35:07.473 --> 35:10.941
You let him go, we'll leave.

35:10.943 --> 35:12.142
You got my word.

35:12.144 --> 35:15.145
No. I walk out of here...

35:15.147 --> 35:16.580
Then he's free.

35:16.582 --> 35:18.215
<i>Otherwise he dies now.</i>

35:18.217 --> 35:19.649
Damn it.

35:19.651 --> 35:21.751
We can't let that
son of a bitch walk.

35:21.753 --> 35:22.986
Murphy, is there
any way that you can,

35:22.988 --> 35:24.754
you can get in there
and back Brandt up?

35:24.756 --> 35:27.724
Just let him go, marcos.
Not unless I'm shooting
through the wall.

35:29.561 --> 35:31.661
What if you did
shoot through the wall?

35:31.663 --> 35:33.763
I'm done with this.
Gideon, are you crazy?

35:33.765 --> 35:35.332
I can shoot anyone.

35:35.334 --> 35:37.167
Well, what if I can help?
What...

35:37.169 --> 35:40.637
What if I can show you
what Brandt is seeing?

35:40.639 --> 35:42.339
How?

35:42.341 --> 35:43.607
Just-just hang on a second. Ada.

35:43.609 --> 35:44.908
Yeah, I'm switching
the feeds now.

35:44.910 --> 35:46.343
<i>Let's figure this out.</i>

35:46.345 --> 35:47.844
We can't figure anything out!

35:47.846 --> 35:49.479
Okay, let's just
talk about this.

35:49.481 --> 35:51.681
Yeah? Yeah, you want
to talk about this now?

35:51.683 --> 35:54.084
Or after I paint the walls
with his brains?

35:54.086 --> 35:56.086
<i>See that pipe
he's standing under?</i>

35:56.088 --> 35:57.587
<i>I see it.</i>

35:57.589 --> 35:59.589
I'm not messing around.

35:59.591 --> 36:00.657
Get back!

36:06.965 --> 36:09.366
Gideon, I can't do this.
I'll be shooting blind.

36:09.368 --> 36:11.034
Just trust the tech.

36:11.036 --> 36:13.103
Nobody's messing with you.

36:13.105 --> 36:15.172
Just lower the gun.

36:16.508 --> 36:19.042
I'm done with this.

36:19.044 --> 36:22.512
I want you and the rest of
the cops out of here now.

36:22.514 --> 36:24.281
What if I can't?

36:24.283 --> 36:26.783
Well, then just trust me.

36:26.785 --> 36:28.518
<i>Switch your gun to lethal.</i>

36:28.520 --> 36:30.353
The quicker
you let him go,

36:30.355 --> 36:31.721
the quicker
we'll be out of here.

36:31.723 --> 36:32.722
You better back off!

36:32.724 --> 36:34.057
This is your last chance.

36:34.059 --> 36:36.226
Listen to me carefully, marcos.

36:36.228 --> 36:37.894
It's not too late
to turn this thing around.

36:37.896 --> 36:39.563
You got him.

36:39.565 --> 36:41.798
We can figure something out.

36:41.800 --> 36:42.899
No!

36:42.901 --> 36:44.968
No, we can't!

36:59.685 --> 37:01.251
Police! Don't move!

37:01.253 --> 37:03.320
Don't move.

37:09.094 --> 37:11.061
He's alive.

37:20.439 --> 37:22.672
<i>Thank you.</i>

37:34.786 --> 37:36.786
<i>What the hell do you mean</i>

37:36.788 --> 37:38.722
Reggie Walker escaped?

37:38.724 --> 37:39.956
Uh, well,

37:39.958 --> 37:40.957
it was crazy, sir.

37:40.959 --> 37:42.759
Uh, we were
questioning him, and, uh,

37:42.761 --> 37:46.096
and then, uh, fearing for
our-our personal safety,

37:46.098 --> 37:48.064
we did a perimeter check,
and, uh,

37:48.066 --> 37:49.733
he, uh... ran off.

37:49.735 --> 37:50.734
Also, we weren't even

37:50.736 --> 37:53.603
really sure if he was the guy.

37:53.605 --> 37:55.705
Why the hell would he escape
if he's the wrong guy?

37:55.707 --> 37:57.140
Well, we're sort of

37:57.142 --> 37:58.875
still trying to
figure that one out.
- Yeah.

37:58.877 --> 38:00.477
We're gonna
hunt for him today.

38:00.479 --> 38:01.645
Uh, but we just
wanted, uh...

38:01.647 --> 38:03.713
Well, we just wanted
to give you an update.

38:03.715 --> 38:05.148
I'm-I'm sorry, captain.

38:05.150 --> 38:08.318
I know the district
was looking for a big bust.

38:08.320 --> 38:10.920
Yeah, well, things may have
changed a little there.

38:10.922 --> 38:14.291
<i>Gideon is down at the mayor's
office with Murphy right now.</i>

38:14.293 --> 38:16.660
Morning.

38:16.662 --> 38:19.629
Before we begin,
I was told

38:19.631 --> 38:21.665
that you have something
urgent to tell me.

38:21.667 --> 38:23.633
I do, I do, I do. Uh...

38:23.635 --> 38:25.335
This is kind of awkward now.

38:25.337 --> 38:27.337
- What is?
- Well, I...

38:27.339 --> 38:29.005
I should have asked
about this before.

38:29.007 --> 38:31.241
I did it again;
I asked some reporters to come

38:31.243 --> 38:33.009
and do a press
conference

38:33.011 --> 38:34.644
after we're done,
so I just wanted

38:34.646 --> 38:37.180
to talk to you about that.

38:37.182 --> 38:39.416
Well, we don't have
anything to talk about.

38:39.418 --> 38:43.353
You see, I-I'm done
being played by you.

38:43.355 --> 38:47.857
And I'm also done
with your publicity stunts.

38:47.859 --> 38:49.759
This is not a stunt.
This is not a stunt.

38:50.929 --> 38:53.697
Have you ever heard
of the drug hi-town?

38:53.699 --> 38:55.965
If you haven't, you haven't
been paying attention.

38:55.967 --> 38:58.635
It's killed
at least 32 people.

38:58.637 --> 39:01.104
And mostly kids.
We're well aware
of what hi-town is,

39:01.106 --> 39:02.472
thank you.

39:02.474 --> 39:06.209
We're also aware that your bust
resulted in a bad arrest.

39:06.211 --> 39:08.311
Actually, there's been
new developments in that case.

39:08.313 --> 39:10.947
We took down marcos Cruz's
cook lab last night,

39:10.949 --> 39:13.283
and arrested him for
kidnapping and attempted murder.

39:13.285 --> 39:14.551
So no more

39:14.553 --> 39:16.119
hi-town in chi-town.

39:16.121 --> 39:17.120
That's...

39:18.223 --> 39:19.622
Hence the-the press conference,

39:19.624 --> 39:21.958
which, it's gonna be out
in the hallway when we're done.

39:21.960 --> 39:23.226
So we're gonna do that again.

39:23.228 --> 39:24.994
I think so, yeah.
So what should I say?

39:24.996 --> 39:28.331
I could say that your office
is unraveling this bust,

39:28.333 --> 39:30.700
all right, as part
of your ongoing campaign

39:30.702 --> 39:32.736
against the 13th.

39:32.738 --> 39:35.739
Or I can say that we really
appreciate your support

39:35.741 --> 39:37.240
in our victory yesterday.

39:37.242 --> 39:39.142
I don't know.
What do you think?

39:40.545 --> 39:43.313
I think you're a son of a...

39:43.315 --> 39:45.548
This is blackmail.
It's blackmail.

39:45.550 --> 39:46.816
Now, Scott,

39:46.818 --> 39:48.418
to be fair,

39:48.420 --> 39:50.954
you said that I should
come to this meeting prepared.

39:53.091 --> 39:55.358
<i>And I would like to thank</i>

39:55.360 --> 39:58.361
my good friend mayor salgado
for all of his support.

39:58.363 --> 40:01.698
Mr. Reeves, how exactly has the
mayor helped the investigation?

40:01.700 --> 40:04.601
Oh, God, how hasn't he,
is more like it.

40:04.603 --> 40:06.770
Listen, it's no secret
that we've had our bumps,

40:06.772 --> 40:08.538
but at this point,

40:08.540 --> 40:10.607
I'm just glad to have
a partner at city hall.

40:10.609 --> 40:11.841
Does this mean that those rumors

40:11.843 --> 40:14.077
of legal issues
at the 13th are untrue?

40:17.549 --> 40:19.115
Uh, absolutely not.

40:19.117 --> 40:21.885
No, no, no,
we're-we're satisfied that

40:21.887 --> 40:25.855
the 13th district is on firm
legal ground in this case.

40:25.857 --> 40:28.425
And we also appreciate
that fact that

40:28.427 --> 40:30.794
they have
followed our lead

40:30.796 --> 40:33.963
in fighting the scourge
of drugs in this city.

40:35.901 --> 40:38.535
Well, congratulations.
You won.

40:38.537 --> 40:41.471
I wasn't trying to win, Scott.
I was just doing my job.

40:41.473 --> 40:43.873
For him?

40:43.875 --> 40:45.375
For the district.

40:45.377 --> 40:47.977
Right, the district,
of course.

40:47.979 --> 40:49.479
Your real family.

40:49.481 --> 40:53.450
Unlike the one
you broke up.

40:53.452 --> 40:54.984
You are unbelievable.

40:54.986 --> 40:58.054
But if you really
want to go there...

40:58.056 --> 41:00.990
I want to introduce
the lead detective on the case.

41:00.992 --> 41:02.926
Without her,
we would not be here.

41:02.928 --> 41:05.428
Murphy, could you come
over here for a second?

41:05.430 --> 41:08.998
People talk about how much money
I spend in the 13th district.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
And by people, I mean
mostly my business manager

41:11.002 --> 41:13.169
and the board of directors.

41:13.171 --> 41:14.838
But the truth is...

41:16.775 --> 41:20.276
The truth is you can't
even begin to put a price

41:20.278 --> 41:23.413
on hard-working cops
like detective Theresa Murphy.

41:24.516 --> 41:26.349
But what is
that price tag, sir?

41:26.351 --> 41:28.251
Well...

Do you two have any idea

It's the amount of money
you two cost the city

You've been on the job 25 years.
Not a Nick on you.
