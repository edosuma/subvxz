09:43.215 --> 09:45.885
WHICH IS GIRL TALK

09:48.921 --> 09:51.857
THANK GOODNESS
WE'RE ALL SAFE AND SOUND.

10:18.417 --> 10:21.020
PHEW, WE GOT HOME
BEFORE THE ANGRY MOB.

10:21.087 --> 10:22.755

10:34.667 --> 10:36.135
NOT EVEN TIMMY.

10:36.202 --> 10:37.103

THIS IS CHET UBETCHA REPORTING

10:56.389 --> 10:58.457

10:59.892 --> 11:01.394
I GIVE IT AN "F"!

11:01.460 --> 11:03.896
ALL RIGHT, MOTHER, LET'S GO HOME
AND CHECK THE FAIRY TRAPS.

11:03.963 --> 11:05.765
NOT LIKE THERE'S ANYTHING
EVER IN THEM.

11:05.831 --> 11:07.299
- THANK YOU FOR COMING.

11:07.366 --> 11:09.101
SEE YOU AT THE NEXT RIOT.

11:09.168 --> 11:10.336
BYE-BYE, NOW.

11:10.403 --> 11:13.005
NOW, WHILE I GET READY FOR BED,

11:13.072 --> 11:14.940
YOU'D BETTER GO APOLOGIZE
TO TIMMY

11:15.007 --> 11:17.576
FOR SENDING AN ANGRY MOB
TO SPEAR HIM WITH PITCHFORKS...

11:17.643 --> 11:18.878
AGAIN.

11:18.944 --> 11:22.114
OOH, I KNOW JUST HOW
TO MAKE IT ALL BETTER.

11:27.820 --> 11:29.155
- GOLLY GEE!

11:29.221 --> 11:31.757
MY HEAD'S BACK ON
JUST IN TIME FOR GRADUATION.

11:35.294 --> 11:37.663
- THANKS FOR LETTING ME WATCH
THE END OF THE MOVIE, DAD.

11:37.730 --> 11:40.766
- OOH, WE SHOULD HAVE WATCHED IT
TOGETHER ALL ALONG, SON.

11:40.833 --> 11:42.968
WITH YOUR BIG, STRONG DAD
TO PROTECT YOU,

11:43.035 --> 11:44.603
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SCARED
AT ALL.

11:44.670 --> 11:46.405
- UH, BUT I WASN'T SCARED.

11:46.472 --> 11:47.840
- SURE YOU WERE.

11:47.907 --> 11:49.508
AND NEITHER WAS I.

11:49.575 --> 11:51.911
- TIME FOR BED, YOU TWO.

[thunder booms]

11:56.115 --> 11:57.583

11:57.650 --> 11:59.518

12:25.911 --> 12:29.482
- TIMMY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP
BEFORE NOON ON A SATURDAY?

12:29.548 --> 12:31.450
- HE MUST NOT BE THE REAL TIMMY.

12:31.517 --> 12:33.119
IMPOSTOR!

12:33.185 --> 12:35.788
- I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS LIST
OF EXTREME WISHES ALL WEEK,

12:35.855 --> 12:37.756
AND I WANT TO GET STARTED
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

12:37.823 --> 12:39.825
- YOU GO WITH THE IMPOSTOR.

12:39.892 --> 12:41.894
I'LL STAY HERE
AND LOOK FOR THE REAL TIMMY.

12:41.961 --> 12:45.498
- FIRST UP, I WISH I WAS
A FORMULA 500 RACE CAR DRIVER

12:45.564 --> 12:47.299
IN AN ATOMIC-POWERED
SUPER RACE CAR

12:47.366 --> 12:48.501
THAT CAN BEND TIME

12:48.567 --> 12:50.536
AND LEAVE FIERY SKID MARKS
IN ITS WAKE.

12:55.508 --> 12:57.076
A MERRY-GO-ROUND?

12:57.143 --> 12:58.043
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

12:58.110 --> 12:59.145
THIS IS SO LAME.

12:59.211 --> 13:00.913
[sigh]
WISH NUMBER TWO.

13:00.980 --> 13:03.115
I WISH I COULD BOUNCE
ACROSS THE MOON.

13:05.117 --> 13:06.085
- POOF! POOF!

13:06.152 --> 13:07.052
- YAY!

13:07.119 --> 13:08.053
- POOF!

13:08.120 --> 13:09.054
- YAHOO!

13:09.121 --> 13:10.789
- POOF! POOF!

13:10.856 --> 13:12.892
THIS ISN'T ANYTHING
LIKE THE MOON.

13:12.958 --> 13:15.494
OKAY, LET'S TRY
WISH NUMBER THREE.

13:15.561 --> 13:18.731
I WISH I COULD WRESTLE A GIANT,
MAN-EATING FIRE-BREATHING SQUID!

13:22.168 --> 13:23.569
- POOF! POOF!

13:23.636 --> 13:26.739
- GREAT, I DON'T SUPPOSE
HE ACTUALLY BREATHES FIRE.

13:26.805 --> 13:28.908
- NO, HE SQUIRTS TOOTHPASTE

13:28.974 --> 13:31.710
SO YOU CAN ALWAYS PRACTICE
GOOD ORAL HYGIENE.

13:31.777 --> 13:33.445
splat!

13:33.512 --> 13:34.480
- AH!

13:34.547 --> 13:36.048
MY EYE IS MINTY FRESH!

13:36.115 --> 13:38.050
WANDA, WHAT'S UP WITH YOU?

13:38.117 --> 13:39.685
EVERY TIME I WISH
FOR SOMETHING AWESOME,

13:39.752 --> 13:41.620
YOU MAKE IT TOTALLY BORING
AND NOT AWESOME.

13:41.687 --> 13:44.223
- OH, SORRY, SPORT,
BUT YOU'VE BEEN MAKING

13:44.290 --> 13:46.325
A LOT OF
DANGEROUS WISHES LATELY,

13:46.392 --> 13:48.994
AND I HAVE TO BABY PROOF THEM
FOR POOF'S SAKE.

13:51.597 --> 13:53.065
- TIMMY WASN'T
AT THE CENTER OF THE EARTH,

13:53.132 --> 13:54.833
BUT I'LL KEEP LOOKING.

13:54.900 --> 13:56.802
HANG ON, REAL TIMMY!

13:56.869 --> 14:00.005
- WANDA, IS THERE ANY WAY AROUND
THIS BABY PROOFING STUFF?

14:00.072 --> 14:01.373
- THE REAL TIMMY WOULD KNOW

14:01.440 --> 14:03.709
THAT EVERY FAIRY COMES
WITH A GUARANTEE.

14:03.776 --> 14:05.344
- "IF THE GODCHILD IN QUESTION

14:05.411 --> 14:07.279
IS IN ANY WAY UNHAPPY
OR DISSATISFIED

14:07.346 --> 14:09.114
WITH THE SERVICES PROVIDED
BY HIS GODPARENT,

14:09.181 --> 14:10.849
HE CAN REQUEST
A TEMPORARY FAIRY."

14:10.916 --> 14:11.817
I CAN?

14:11.884 --> 14:14.420
- WELL, TECHNICALLY, YES.

14:14.486 --> 14:17.590
BUT I KNOW YOU LOVE US SO MUCH,
YOU'D NEVER REPLACE US WITH--

14:17.656 --> 14:19.959
- I WISH I HAD
A TEMPORARY FAIRY!

14:20.025 --> 14:21.660
boom!

14:21.727 --> 14:24.196
- TEMPORARY FAIRY
AT YOUR SERVICE.

14:24.263 --> 14:25.564
- JORGEN?

14:25.631 --> 14:27.433
YOU'RE MY TEMPORARY FAIRY?

14:27.499 --> 14:30.536
AREN'T THERE, LIKE, A BILLION
OTHER FAIRIES I CAN CHOOSE FROM?

14:30.603 --> 14:32.271
OR, LIKE, ONE?

14:32.338 --> 14:33.305
- NOPE.

14:33.372 --> 14:34.673
ALL THE OTHERS HAVE GODKIDS.

14:34.740 --> 14:36.408
AND NOW THAT ALL THE LAWSUITS
HAVE BEEN SETTLED,

14:36.475 --> 14:37.443
I'M AVAILABLE.

14:37.509 --> 14:39.712
- TIMMY,
YOU'RE MAKING A MISTAKE.

14:39.778 --> 14:43.015
THERE'S A REASON JORGEN DOESN'T
HAVE A FULL-TIME GODCHILD.

14:43.082 --> 14:45.718
- SADLY, THE NAGGING ONE
SPEAKS THE TRUTH.

14:45.784 --> 14:48.387
MOST KIDS DO NOT APPRECIATE
SUPER ATOMIC RACE CARS,

14:48.454 --> 14:49.555
BOUNCING ON THE MOON,

14:49.622 --> 14:52.157
OR FIRE-BREATHING SQUIDS
WHO EAT PEOPLE.

14:52.224 --> 14:54.793
I GUESS I AM JUST
TRAGICALLY MISUNDERSTOOD.

14:54.860 --> 14:56.328
- NOT BY ME YOU'RE NOT.

14:56.395 --> 14:58.163
LET'S DO THIS.

14:58.230 --> 14:59.531
- HEY HEY!

14:59.598 --> 15:01.734
JUST SIGN THIS CONTRACT
RIGHT BELOW THIS CLAUSE

15:01.800 --> 15:03.569
THAT CLEARS ME
OF ANY RESPONSIBILITY

15:03.636 --> 15:07.172
SHOULD YOU BE MAIMED, SEVERED,
CHARRED, BOILED, SHAVED,

15:07.239 --> 15:10.042
PLUCKED, DISEMBOWELED,
JUGGLED BY MONKEYS,

15:10.109 --> 15:12.144
RIPPED APART,
GIVEN THE MEASLES,

15:12.211 --> 15:14.813
MUTILATED, FROZEN,
OR BURNED AT THE STAKE.

15:17.483 --> 15:18.417
- SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.

15:20.519 --> 15:22.688
[evil laughter]

15:26.725 --> 15:27.726
WAHOO!

15:27.793 --> 15:29.895

15:35.534 --> 15:37.036
ka-boom!

15:37.102 --> 15:39.138
HA HA!

15:39.204 --> 15:40.706
THANKS TO THE MOON'S
LACK OF GRAVITY,

15:40.773 --> 15:42.274
I'M SUPER STRONG.

15:42.341 --> 15:43.942
HA HA!

15:49.581 --> 15:51.684
- OH, ARE YOU OKAY, SPORT?

15:51.750 --> 15:53.052
DID JORGEN HURT YOU?

15:53.118 --> 15:54.286
IS ANYTHING BROKEN?

15:54.353 --> 15:56.255
LET ME TAKE A LOOK.

15:56.322 --> 15:57.890
- WANDA, I'M GREAT.

15:57.956 --> 16:00.125
I JUST DID THREE EXTREME WISHES
IN A ROW.

16:00.192 --> 16:02.061
JORGEN'S AWESOME.

16:02.127 --> 16:06.031
- OH, YOU ARE JUST SAYING THAT
BECAUSE IT IS COMPLETELY TRUE.

16:07.199 --> 16:08.467
- THERE.

16:08.534 --> 16:10.169
THESE POSTERS WILL HELP
IN THE SEARCH FOR TIMMY.

16:10.235 --> 16:11.737
- YOU ARE AN IDIOT.

16:11.804 --> 16:13.972
SERIOUSLY, THERE CAN'T BE ANYONE
IN THE WORLD

16:14.039 --> 16:15.441
LESS INTELLIGENT THAN YOU.

16:15.507 --> 16:17.142
- OH, TIMMY!

16:18.777 --> 16:20.879
OOH, TRYING TO OPEN THE DOOR
WITH MY MIND DIDN'T WORK.

16:20.946 --> 16:22.181
- UH-OH, IT'S MY DAD!

16:22.247 --> 16:23.549
QUICK, HIDE!

16:25.984 --> 16:27.753
- A RHINO?

16:27.820 --> 16:29.455
- WHAT?
IT IS MANLY.

16:29.521 --> 16:31.323
- JUST CAME TO SAY GOOD NIGHT,
SON.

16:31.390 --> 16:33.459
OOH, LOVE THE RHINO.

16:33.525 --> 16:36.628
IT'S MUCH MORE MANLY THAN YOUR
EMBARRASSINGLY UNMANLY FISH.

16:36.695 --> 16:37.663
- GAH!

16:37.730 --> 16:39.598
OH, NO.
TIMMY'S MISSING?

16:39.665 --> 16:41.533
I'LL FIND YOU, SON!

16:44.002 --> 16:45.738
OH, MIND POWERS
STILL NOT WORKING.

16:45.804 --> 16:47.106
- WELL, GOOD NIGHT.

16:47.172 --> 16:48.207
I LOVE YOU.

16:48.273 --> 16:50.075
- AW, WE LOVE--

16:50.142 --> 16:51.276
- NOT YOU.

16:51.343 --> 16:53.045
I WAS TALKING
TO MY TEMPORARY FAIRY.

16:53.112 --> 16:54.646
- GOOD NIGHT, TURNER.

16:54.713 --> 16:56.248
SEE YOU FIRST THING
IN THE MORNING.

16:58.183 --> 16:59.918
HA HA!

16:59.985 --> 17:01.320

17:01.387 --> 17:03.188
- IT'S FIRST THING
IN THE MORNING.

17:03.255 --> 17:04.589
TIME TO START A BRAND-NEW DAY

17:04.656 --> 17:06.625
OF SUPER CHARGED,
HEAVY-DUTY WISHES.

17:06.692 --> 17:07.626
- IT'S THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

17:07.693 --> 17:08.660
CAN'T WE JUST--

17:08.727 --> 17:09.895
- GO NIGHT SKYDIVING

17:09.962 --> 17:11.262
ON THE EIGHTH MOON OF JUPITER

17:11.329 --> 17:13.565

OF THE GALACTORIAN SPACE EEL?

NAMBY-PAMBY BABY PARACHUTE,

17:28.747 --> 17:30.783
YOU'VE GOT A RABID BEAVER

17:37.956 --> 17:40.225
WELL, AT LEAST MY FEET ARE
ON THE GROUND THIS TIME.

17:40.292 --> 17:42.027
- ONLY INSTEAD OF A SNOWBOARD,

17:42.094 --> 17:45.097
YOU'RE RIDING ON THE BELLY OF
A HUNGRY, TWO-HEADED CROCODILE.

CHASED BY A HERD
OF GREEN FLAMINGOS

17:59.378 --> 18:01.647
ACROSS A DESERT
OF FLAMING CORN COBS?

18:01.713 --> 18:05.184
- YES, EVERYONE KNOWS
GREEN FLAMINGOS ARE MUCH MEANER

18:05.250 --> 18:06.185
THAN THE PINK ONES.

18:08.520 --> 18:09.721
- TIME-OUT.

18:09.788 --> 18:12.391
I NEED TO CATCH MY BREATH
IN THIS CAVE.

18:12.458 --> 18:15.327
- OH, THIS IS NOT A CAVE.

18:15.394 --> 18:18.297

I JUST WANT TO STAY

19:00.239 --> 19:01.607
- IT'S TOMORROW, TURNER.

19:01.673 --> 19:02.608
HA, HA, HA!

19:02.674 --> 19:04.042
YOU FALL FOR THAT EVERY TIME.

19:04.109 --> 19:04.977
LET'S SEE.

19:06.912 --> 19:08.480
ON DECK FOR TODAY,

19:08.547 --> 19:11.350
WE HAVE BUNGEE JUMPING INTO THE
BOILING SULFUR PITS OF URANUS

19:11.416 --> 19:13.819
FOLLOWED BY DIVING INTO A PIT

19:13.886 --> 19:15.554
AND THEN WE WILL WRAP IT ALL UP

19:15.621 --> 19:17.356
WITH A BELLY SLIDE

19:17.422 --> 19:19.291
INTO A POOL OF RUBBING ALCOHOL.

19:19.358 --> 19:21.260
- THIS PRESENTATION

19:21.326 --> 19:24.730
boom!

19:24.796 --> 19:25.697

19:25.764 --> 19:26.865
I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE!

19:26.932 --> 19:28.767
NO MORE EXPLOSIONS, FLAMES,

19:28.834 --> 19:30.569
OR GALACTORIAN EEL BELLIES.

19:30.636 --> 19:32.137
YOU'RE FIRED!

19:32.204 --> 19:33.171
- HA!

19:33.238 --> 19:34.506
YOU CANNOT FIRE ME, TURNER.

19:34.573 --> 19:36.208
THANKS TO MY TEAM OF LAWYERS,

19:36.275 --> 19:38.944
THIS CONTRACT, UNLIKE YOU,
IS UNBREAKABLE.

19:39.011 --> 19:40.479
READ THE FINE PRINT.

19:40.546 --> 19:42.681
- "THIS CONTRACT IS BINDING
FOR ONE YEAR

19:42.748 --> 19:44.683
OR UNTIL TIMMY TURNER
TOTALLY EXPLODES,

19:44.750 --> 19:46.051
WHICHEVER COMES FIRST."

19:46.118 --> 19:47.986
I'M STUCK WITH YOU FOR A YEAR?

19:48.053 --> 19:48.987
- DON'T WORRY.

19:49.054 --> 19:51.390
YOU WILL EXPLODE
WAY BEFORE THAT.

19:51.456 --> 19:52.891
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

19:52.958 --> 19:54.459
I HAVE TO GUNPOWDER MY NOSE.

19:56.295 --> 19:57.563
- I FOUND TIMMY.

19:57.629 --> 19:59.631
I RECOGNIZED HIM BY HIS TEETH.

19:59.698 --> 20:02.067
HE'S BEEN LIVING IN THE WILD
LIKE A SAVAGE.

20:02.134 --> 20:03.569
- [growling]

20:03.635 --> 20:05.370
- WE'LL HAVE TO TEACH HIM
ENGLISH AGAIN.

20:05.437 --> 20:09.207
TIMMY, SAY "CHIMICHANGA."

20:09.274 --> 20:11.276
- [growling]

20:11.343 --> 20:13.078
- WANDA, YOU GOT TO HELP ME.

20:13.145 --> 20:15.047
I WISH JORGEN
WOULD JUST GO AWAY.

20:15.113 --> 20:16.448
- SORRY, TIMMY.

20:16.515 --> 20:18.350
BUT YOU SIGNED A CONTRACT,

20:18.417 --> 20:20.552
AND WE'RE NOT
YOUR FAIRIES RIGHT NOW.

20:20.619 --> 20:21.553
JORGEN IS.

20:21.620 --> 20:22.854
- NO WAY!

20:22.921 --> 20:24.723
HOW DO I GET OUT
OF THE CONTRACT?

20:24.790 --> 20:26.925
- THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY OUT.

20:26.992 --> 20:29.061
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WISH
FOR SOMETHING TOO HORRIBLE

20:29.127 --> 20:30.929
FOR EVEN JORGEN TO HANDLE.

20:30.996 --> 20:32.598
- BUT HE'S NOT
AFRAID OF ANYTHING.

20:32.664 --> 20:34.433
WHAT COULD POSSIBLY
SCARE HIM OFF?

20:37.169 --> 20:38.103
flush!

20:38.170 --> 20:39.404
- ALL RIGHT, TURNER.

20:39.471 --> 20:40.772
BATHROOM BREAK IS OVER.

20:40.839 --> 20:41.974
TIME TO ROLL!

20:42.040 --> 20:43.475
SPEAKING OF ROLLS,

20:43.542 --> 20:45.577
I REPLACED YOUR TOILET PAPER
WITH FLAMING SANDPAPER.

20:45.644 --> 20:46.979
[maniacal laughter]

20:47.045 --> 20:49.548
- BUT WE'RE GONNA DO THINGS
MY WAY THIS TIME,

20:49.615 --> 20:51.984
AND I SAY WE NAMBY-PAMBY
BABY THINGS UP

20:52.050 --> 20:53.385
TO THE MAX.

20:53.452 --> 20:55.554
- TURNER, YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.

20:55.621 --> 20:57.122
- OH, YES, I CAN.

20:57.189 --> 21:00.025
I'M YOUR GODKID,
AND YOU HAVE TO DO WHAT I SAY.

21:00.092 --> 21:02.628
I WISH YOU WERE WEARING NOTHING
BUT A BABY DIAPER.

21:04.229 --> 21:06.431
- TURNER, THIS IS TOO NAMBY.

21:06.498 --> 21:08.200
I DEMAND YOU WISH
FOR SOMETHING ELSE.

21:08.266 --> 21:09.234
- OKAY.

21:09.301 --> 21:10.235
I WISH YOU WERE IN A PLAYPEN

21:10.302 --> 21:11.470
WEARING A PINK BONNET.

21:14.873 --> 21:15.774
- YAH!

21:15.841 --> 21:17.576
NOW, THIS IS TOO PAMBY!

21:17.643 --> 21:19.578
- I WISH WE WERE
AT FAIRY WORLD STADIUM

21:19.645 --> 21:21.713
AND YOU WERE SUCKING ON
A PACIFIER

21:21.780 --> 21:24.149
AND YOUR IMAGE WAS ON
THE JUMBO VIEW!

21:24.216 --> 21:25.083
- WHA?

21:27.686 --> 21:28.620
YAH!

21:28.687 --> 21:29.554
crash!

21:32.224 --> 21:35.594
NOW, THIS IS FULL-ON
NAMBY-PAMBY BABY STUFF.

21:35.661 --> 21:38.530
THANK GOODNESS THERE IS
NO ONE HERE TO SEE THIS.

21:38.597 --> 21:41.600
- I WISH THE STADIUM
WAS FULL OF FAIRIES!

21:41.667 --> 21:44.569
[crowd cheering]

21:48.407 --> 21:51.276
[laughter]

21:53.111 --> 21:56.048
- IT SURE IS GREAT SPENDING TIME
WITH YOU AGAIN, TIMMY.

21:56.114 --> 21:58.517
IT'S IMPORTANT
YOU REINTEGRATE INTO SOCIETY.

21:58.583 --> 21:59.518
HOW'S THE LOG?

21:59.584 --> 22:00.519
- [growling]

22:00.585 --> 22:02.821
[laughter]

22:02.888 --> 22:04.356
- STOP LAUGHING!
STOP!

22:04.423 --> 22:06.425
OKAY, TURNER, YOU WIN.

22:06.491 --> 22:08.060
I'LL RIP UP THE CONTRACT.

22:09.361 --> 22:10.629
THERE!

22:10.696 --> 22:12.898
I AM NO LONGER
YOUR TEMPORARY FAIRY.

22:14.199 --> 22:15.434
- YOU DID IT, TIMMY.

22:15.500 --> 22:17.803
YOU OUT-JORGENED JORGEN.

22:17.869 --> 22:19.104
- POOF! POOF!

22:19.171 --> 22:21.506
- WANDA, I'M SORRY
I REPLACED YOU GUYS.

22:21.573 --> 22:23.175
I TOTALLY LEARNED MY LESSON.

22:23.241 --> 22:24.976
YOU'RE THE ONLY FAIRIES
I'D EVER WANT,

22:25.043 --> 22:27.379
NO MATTER HOW MUCH
BABY PROOFING YOU DO.

22:27.446 --> 22:29.081
- WELCOME BACK, TIMMY.

22:30.382 --> 22:32.184
NOW, HOW ABOUT ANOTHER WISH?

22:32.250 --> 22:33.218
- YOU BET.

22:33.285 --> 22:34.186
I WISH WE WERE ALL

22:34.252 --> 22:36.655
ON A SUPER COLOSSAL WATER SLIDE!

22:39.524 --> 22:41.259
WOO-HOO!

22:45.263 --> 22:46.531
- SORRY, SPORT.

22:46.598 --> 22:47.766
- ARE YOU KIDDING?

22:47.833 --> 22:49.668
THIS IS PERFECT.

22:49.735 --> 22:51.403
WELL, REAL TIMMY,

22:51.470 --> 22:53.305
IF YOU DON'T LIKE
MY WISH GRANTING,

22:53.371 --> 22:56.141
WHY DON'T YOU FIND YOURSELF
A TEMPORARY FAIRY?

22:56.208 --> 22:57.609
boom!

22:57.676 --> 23:00.345
- DID I HEAR SOMEONE SAY
THEY NEED A TEMPORARY FAIRY?

23:00.412 --> 23:02.347
- [growling]

23:02.414 --> 23:03.381
- WAH! WAH!

23:03.448 --> 23:05.517
DON'T BUILD A DAM IN THERE!

23:05.584 --> 23:07.185
I'M CALLING MY LAWYERS!

23:10.589 --> 23:12.724
- WELL, TIMMY'S NOT
AT THE CENTER OF THE EARTH.

23:12.791 --> 23:16.161
WHERE ARE YOU, TIMMY!

23:16.228 --> 23:17.162
