00:33.041 --> 00:33.986
<i>Ben.</i>

00:35.690 --> 00:38.260
Hey, partner.
Merry Christmas.

00:38.705 --> 00:40.609
When are you gonna
break down and buy a car?

00:41.653 --> 00:44.420
I own 72 rigs.
Why should I buy a car?

00:44.846 --> 00:46.546
And what the hell
are you wearing there?

00:46.570 --> 00:49.520
I know, it's pretty awful.
It's from the Christmas party.

00:49.749 --> 00:52.003
Guess who my Secret Santa was?

00:52.714 --> 00:53.960
- Monk.
- Monk.

00:54.415 --> 00:55.987
I thought you were
gonna fire his ass.

00:56.046 --> 00:58.126
I didn't have the heart.
You know, it's Christmas.

00:58.205 --> 00:59.265
Hell, I'll do it.

00:59.266 --> 01:00.957
It should've been done
a long time ago.

01:01.013 --> 01:02.531
So what's so important?

01:02.532 --> 01:05.866
We're being audited
or the depot burn down or something?

01:12.212 --> 01:13.707
Looks like you were
in my office.

01:13.787 --> 01:15.716
It's our office, Ben.
We're partners, remember?

01:16.041 --> 01:18.131
At least I thought so.
There are forgeries.

01:18.171 --> 01:20.131
Kenneth,
you're an accountant.

01:20.388 --> 01:22.524
You don't know the first
thing about maintenance.

01:22.559 --> 01:24.865
Do I have to call Chicago
and crosscheck these invoices?

01:24.905 --> 01:26.091
Because I will.

01:26.683 --> 01:29.166
You been buying
recycled parts for these rigs

01:29.312 --> 01:30.631
and pocketing
the difference?

01:30.632 --> 01:32.544
I don't believe this.
You know, after 9 years--

01:32.563 --> 01:33.699
It's not just the money.

01:33.940 --> 01:35.627
We have 72 drivers
on the road.

01:35.687 --> 01:38.899
- Now, what if something happens?
- Hey, partner, relax.

01:39.394 --> 01:41.633
Because unless you have proof,
and I mean real proof--

01:41.767 --> 01:43.012
I have proof.

01:44.136 --> 01:47.117
There's proof in every engine
in every truck in the fleet.

01:47.176 --> 01:49.232
You want proof?
You want to see proof?

01:49.266 --> 01:50.532
I know enough.

01:50.884 --> 01:53.533
I know enough,
my friend.

01:54.547 --> 01:55.714
Exhibit "A".

01:56.489 --> 01:57.735
That manifold.

01:58.254 --> 02:00.627
Now according to this,
it's brand-new.

02:00.786 --> 02:03.128
Look at it. The gasket's loose.
It's all rusted out.

02:03.148 --> 02:05.263
If that thing cracks,
the whole engine's gonna blow.

02:05.283 --> 02:06.864
I don't want that
responsibility--

02:11.038 --> 02:12.245
Cut me loose, Ben!

02:16.802 --> 02:18.629
Cut me loose, Ben!

02:19.361 --> 02:20.468
Please!

02:24.078 --> 02:25.561
What are you doing?!

02:44.118 --> 02:46.747
5x09 - Mr. Monk Meets His Dad

03:41.023 --> 03:42.268
They smell great.

03:42.355 --> 03:44.699
Yeah.
Oh, can I have that one?

03:44.700 --> 03:46.718
Mr. Monk, you have to wait.
They're for the party.

03:46.758 --> 03:49.833
Please, just that one,
that Christmas tree.

03:49.853 --> 03:52.896
No see, then you'll want another one,
she'll want one. I didn't make enough.

03:52.916 --> 03:54.326
Natalie!
Please.

03:55.071 --> 03:57.851
Just one cookie.
One stupid cookie.

03:58.325 --> 04:00.642
I'm beseeching you.

04:00.872 --> 04:02.739
I promise I'll never ask
for anything else.

04:02.758 --> 04:03.744
Please.

04:03.872 --> 04:05.255
Please, I gotta have
that cookie!

04:05.295 --> 04:06.597
Okay, fine.
Take the cookie.

04:06.676 --> 04:07.882
Thank you.

04:15.337 --> 04:17.918
That was a little crooked.
What's up with that elf?

04:17.997 --> 04:19.279
Mr. Monk, the elf is perfect.

04:19.339 --> 04:20.411
A little droopy--

04:25.457 --> 04:26.677
Telephone for you.

04:27.684 --> 04:29.540
Julie, do not let him
touch those cookies.

04:32.889 --> 04:34.233
Yes, Captain,
he's right here.

04:36.536 --> 04:37.742
Just give it to me.

04:39.762 --> 04:41.027
Okay.
I'll tell him.

04:42.807 --> 04:44.289
<i>Julie, it's okay.</i>

04:45.583 --> 04:47.382
Mr. Monk, you can have
any cookie you want.

04:48.489 --> 04:51.099
Mom...what happened?

04:51.894 --> 04:53.239
It's your father.

04:55.744 --> 04:57.044
My father?

04:57.274 --> 04:59.111
I almost forgot
you had a father.

04:59.355 --> 05:01.476
Honey,
everybody has a father.

05:02.145 --> 05:04.772
Well, it's just you don't
mention him very much.

05:06.394 --> 05:09.596
Not everyone has a father
worth mentioning.

05:18.019 --> 05:19.377
<i>He's downtown.</i>

05:21.565 --> 05:22.644
He's in jail.

05:30.405 --> 05:32.277
When was the last time
you saw him?

05:32.824 --> 05:34.278
It was a lifetime ago.

05:34.580 --> 05:36.435
I was eight years old.

05:37.524 --> 05:39.911
He said he was going downtown
to pick up some dinner.

05:39.970 --> 05:41.736
And I watched him
drive away.

05:42.852 --> 05:45.478
He waved to me.
I'll never forget that.

05:46.564 --> 05:47.770
How he waved.

05:52.869 --> 05:54.278
Then he was gone.

05:56.766 --> 05:58.644
My childhood was over.

06:01.409 --> 06:02.654
My mother...

06:04.154 --> 06:05.677
never laughed again.

06:08.250 --> 06:10.602
Families are always
complicated.

06:12.267 --> 06:13.868
It wasn't complicated.

06:15.352 --> 06:16.677
He just waved,

06:17.258 --> 06:18.577
then he was gone.

06:20.070 --> 06:21.533
Let's see here.

06:22.452 --> 06:23.776
Jack Monk.

06:26.616 --> 06:28.452
They picked him up
for a traffic violation.

06:28.511 --> 06:29.816
He ran a red light.

06:31.104 --> 06:32.794
They brought him up for that?

06:33.504 --> 06:36.011
Apparently he resisted arrest.
He shoved the cop.

06:36.261 --> 06:37.858
When they brought him in
for booking,

06:37.917 --> 06:39.444
he started asking for you.

06:39.794 --> 06:41.838
We got him in
a holding cell upstairs.

06:42.352 --> 06:45.198
His rig is parked
in the impound lot out back.

06:45.618 --> 06:46.665
What rig?

06:46.705 --> 06:48.781
His rig.
It's a tractor trailer.

06:49.351 --> 06:50.776
Your dad is a truck driver.

06:50.954 --> 06:52.156
I don't think so.

06:53.017 --> 06:54.186
He's a writer.

06:54.245 --> 06:55.590
He writes school books.

06:57.494 --> 06:59.944
You two obviously have
a lot to talk about.

07:07.895 --> 07:09.144
What are you doing?

07:09.628 --> 07:10.854
I'm speed reading.

07:11.441 --> 07:12.703
What's your rush?

07:12.822 --> 07:13.944
I'm old.

07:14.154 --> 07:15.677
Jack Monk,
your son is here.

07:22.482 --> 07:23.787
I'm looking at you...

07:24.910 --> 07:26.211
but I see your mother.

07:29.138 --> 07:31.360
I'm Leland
Stottlemeyer, sir.

07:31.458 --> 07:32.921
This is Adrian.

07:34.845 --> 07:36.486
That man looks just like
your mother.

07:39.612 --> 07:40.680
How are you?

07:42.568 --> 07:43.794
How am I?

07:44.878 --> 07:46.222
Is that what you said?

07:46.377 --> 07:47.677
Yes, how are you?

07:48.179 --> 07:50.492
That's a rather
conventional salutation.

07:51.029 --> 07:52.943
In Texas,
people use it all the time.

07:53.177 --> 07:54.685
Texas?
Yeah, Midland.

07:54.744 --> 07:57.082
I got a place in Midland,
but I'm hardly ever there.

07:57.339 --> 08:00.013
I'm driving 18-wheelers.
Long hauls.

08:00.289 --> 08:02.211
"I travel for travel's sake

08:02.467 --> 08:05.749
to come down off of this
featherbed of civilization."

08:06.098 --> 08:07.410
Robert Louis Stevenson.

08:07.450 --> 08:09.211
Jack, I don't want to hear it.

08:09.788 --> 08:11.747
You called me. I'm here.
What do you want?

08:12.628 --> 08:14.408
For one thing you can
call me "Dad."

08:21.940 --> 08:23.245
I'll settle for "Pops."

08:24.041 --> 08:25.089
"Pappy?"

08:25.893 --> 08:28.463
You know, forget about it.
I'm getting used to Jack.

08:28.775 --> 08:30.618
What do I want from you?
Two things.

08:30.856 --> 08:33.443
"A," forgive me.

08:34.491 --> 08:35.940
Forgive your father.

08:36.078 --> 08:38.345
I was negligent.
I was selfish.

08:39.075 --> 08:40.301
And I'm very sorry.

08:40.714 --> 08:43.039
"B," get me the hell
out of Dodge.

08:43.260 --> 08:45.455
But if you can do one,
I'll take "B."

08:46.228 --> 08:47.966
I gotta be in Phoenix
early in the morning.

08:48.006 --> 08:49.434
That's why you called me?

08:50.181 --> 08:51.723
After 39 years.

08:52.401 --> 08:53.754
To fix a parking ticket?

08:53.833 --> 08:55.118
I know you can do it.

08:55.197 --> 08:56.581
I've been reading all about you.

08:56.640 --> 08:58.676
You are a hotshot detective.

08:59.525 --> 09:02.480
Which I take a little bit
of credit for.

09:03.011 --> 09:05.262
Who read Sherlock Holmes
to you every night?

09:05.460 --> 09:08.078
"Holmes, oh,
you amaze me."

09:11.018 --> 09:12.772
Adrian, here's the thing.

09:12.950 --> 09:15.144
If I don't get to Phoenix
in the morning,

09:15.610 --> 09:16.816
I lose the job.

09:18.136 --> 09:20.711
And this gig,
it's my life.

09:24.140 --> 09:25.211
What do you say?

09:28.669 --> 09:29.717
I say good-bye.

09:33.469 --> 09:34.487
Monk,

09:35.499 --> 09:37.576
Hey, Monk, look.
He's not a young man.

09:37.628 --> 09:39.718
If you walk away now,
you might never see him again.

09:39.757 --> 09:40.943
You promise?

10:04.682 --> 10:05.682
Mr. Monk?

10:06.655 --> 10:08.491
I'm, Randy Disher.

10:08.629 --> 10:09.844
I work with your son.

10:10.647 --> 10:11.636
This is an honor.

10:12.285 --> 10:13.774
And a pleasure
and a privilege.

10:14.086 --> 10:15.173
Why?

10:15.420 --> 10:17.273
I--I don't know.

10:17.274 --> 10:21.022
I just thought it was
an honor and a pleasure.

10:22.870 --> 10:24.238
I could be wrong.

10:27.739 --> 10:29.843
Here's your release.
You're free to go.

10:31.816 --> 10:34.090
I thought after I'm done
with this run

10:34.352 --> 10:36.739
I would stop by
and we could talk.

10:36.740 --> 10:38.844
- You know, catch up a little--
- Don't say that.

10:38.923 --> 10:40.778
Don't say anything.

10:41.312 --> 10:42.558
Just go.

10:43.308 --> 10:45.246
And when you drive away,
don't wave.

10:47.626 --> 10:49.096
Well, Merry Christmas anyway.

10:49.152 --> 10:50.946
Right.

10:53.813 --> 10:54.949
Ask him.

10:55.278 --> 10:57.839
- Ask him what?
- You know what. Ask him.

11:07.327 --> 11:09.606
Long as you're here,
with don't you stay

11:10.293 --> 11:12.368
and have Christmas dinner
with Ambrose and me.

11:12.546 --> 11:13.879
It'd mean the world to him.

11:14.059 --> 11:16.378
I wish I could.
I'm already three hours behind.

11:17.240 --> 11:18.643
He wishes he could.

11:18.843 --> 11:20.148
You could come with me.

11:22.066 --> 11:23.600
- With you?
- Yeah.

11:23.817 --> 11:25.591
You'll be back here
in three days.

11:27.796 --> 11:29.002
I don't think so.

11:29.078 --> 11:30.668
Okay, maybe another time.

11:31.566 --> 11:32.613
Take care.

11:35.963 --> 11:37.133
What?
I can't just leave.

11:37.173 --> 11:38.730
I don't have my toothbrush.

11:38.763 --> 11:40.527
I can't travel
without my toothbrush.

11:40.586 --> 11:42.444
You can buy a toothbrush.
Or my pillow case

11:42.503 --> 11:44.262
or my Trudy kit
or my house.

11:44.324 --> 11:45.903
I never go anywhere
without my house.

11:46.022 --> 11:47.650
You can buy
all that stuff, Monk.

11:47.651 --> 11:50.751
What you can't buy
is another shot.

11:59.369 --> 12:00.651
Jack, wait up.

12:01.700 --> 12:02.734
Wait up.

12:03.011 --> 12:04.197
Other side.

12:53.667 --> 12:54.834
You thirsty?

12:54.974 --> 12:56.568
No, thank you.

12:56.759 --> 12:57.807
What?

12:58.941 --> 13:00.173
Here, look.
I'm wiping.

13:00.804 --> 13:01.971
Come on.

13:02.770 --> 13:03.907
Here.

13:04.373 --> 13:06.249
You still got that thing
about germs, huh?

13:07.714 --> 13:08.821
I'm not surprised.

13:09.241 --> 13:10.935
Your mother said
you would outgrow it,

13:11.014 --> 13:12.974
but I tried to tell her
people don't change.

13:13.198 --> 13:14.674
They say
they're gonna change.

13:14.856 --> 13:16.833
They swear to God
they're gonna change.

13:17.435 --> 13:19.606
But at the end of the day,
you are who you are.

13:20.002 --> 13:21.880
So how was your childhood?

13:23.249 --> 13:24.673
Oh, it was great.

13:25.318 --> 13:27.474
It was a laugh riot.
You should've been there.

13:28.099 --> 13:30.412
You're right. I should've been there.
But I'm here now.

13:31.311 --> 13:32.474
I'm here too.

13:34.450 --> 13:35.617
Do--do you hear that?

13:36.523 --> 13:38.085
Sounds like a rattle.

13:38.830 --> 13:40.214
Look, relax, relax.

13:41.280 --> 13:42.351
Do you want to drive?

13:43.215 --> 13:44.343
Come on, it's easy.

13:44.344 --> 13:46.470
It's like shifting gears.
It's like riding a bike.

13:46.509 --> 13:47.651
I can't ride a bike.

13:47.869 --> 13:49.072
You can't ride a bicycle?

13:49.289 --> 13:50.443
I never learned.

13:51.041 --> 13:52.247
No one ever taught me.

13:55.461 --> 13:56.645
You want to get into it?

13:56.961 --> 13:58.093
Let's get into it.

13:58.113 --> 14:00.265
Adrian, I never
planned to leave, okay?

14:00.606 --> 14:02.361
I went out to get
some Chinese food,

14:02.460 --> 14:05.023
and on the way back
I open up a fortune cookie.

14:05.300 --> 14:07.802
And it said,
"Stand by your man."

14:08.593 --> 14:10.031
"Stand by your man."

14:10.169 --> 14:11.362
Yeah, that's right.

14:11.540 --> 14:13.857
It sounds crazy,
but it affected me, all right?

14:13.975 --> 14:15.142
It hit me right here.

14:15.496 --> 14:17.651
I realized
I am my man.

14:18.508 --> 14:19.773
I gotta stand by me.

14:20.143 --> 14:21.606
I gotta follow my bliss.

14:22.966 --> 14:25.160
I was driving home,
and I kept on going.

14:25.676 --> 14:27.416
And I've been driving ever since.

14:31.259 --> 14:32.332
Senior?

14:32.392 --> 14:33.499
Excuse me?

14:33.667 --> 14:36.327
It's says,
"Driver: Jack Monk, Sr."

14:36.418 --> 14:37.466
Oh, boy.

14:38.740 --> 14:40.895
Is there a Jack Junior?

14:43.302 --> 14:44.389
Your brother.

14:45.497 --> 14:46.712
I have a brother.

14:48.040 --> 14:49.210
It's another brother.

14:49.439 --> 14:51.633
It's a big day for you.
A lot to digest.

14:52.774 --> 14:54.060
My other brother.

14:55.084 --> 14:56.655
And he's Jack Junior?

14:56.690 --> 14:59.046
If it makes you feel any better,
I left his mother too.

14:59.086 --> 15:00.823
Why would that make me
feel any better?

15:01.198 --> 15:02.266
I don't know.

15:03.327 --> 15:04.981
He lives in Baltimore.
He's 31.

15:05.100 --> 15:07.057
He's an orthopedic surgeon.

15:07.400 --> 15:09.156
Very well respected.
He's famous.

15:09.839 --> 15:12.387
He wants me to come live with him.
I said, "What am I gonna do?

15:12.426 --> 15:14.324
"sit on the porch and pet
a dog all day long

15:14.383 --> 15:15.413
until I drop dead?"

15:15.777 --> 15:16.904
Not for me.

15:18.069 --> 15:19.246
He looks happy.

15:19.545 --> 15:21.739
Yeah, that was his birthday.
He was eight.

15:23.280 --> 15:24.585
<i>That's a nice bike.</i>

15:25.072 --> 15:26.357
That was his big gift.

15:26.868 --> 15:28.647
That's me,
teaching him how to ride.

15:33.666 --> 15:35.465
Hey, I got an idea.

15:36.048 --> 15:37.373
Why don't we buy a bike?

15:37.682 --> 15:38.888
Come on, let's do it.

15:39.003 --> 15:40.781
I'll pull over
and teach you how to ride.

15:40.860 --> 15:41.981
It's never too late.

15:43.573 --> 15:45.511
Yeah...it is.

16:03.140 --> 16:04.741
Oh, it's Mr. Monk!
It's Mr. Monk.

16:05.295 --> 16:07.718
I've been so worried about you.
Where are you?

16:07.847 --> 16:09.686
How's it going?
What's he like?

16:09.728 --> 16:12.101
Wait, hold on, I'm gonna
put you on speakerphone. Hold on.

16:12.160 --> 16:13.419
Merry Christmas, Monk!

16:13.453 --> 16:15.355
Hey, Happy Holidays, buddy!

16:15.940 --> 16:18.846
<i>Natalie, this was a big mistake.
I need to go home now.</i>

16:19.159 --> 16:21.512
<i>Please.
Please, I want to come home!</i>

16:21.739 --> 16:23.204
<i>Please, please.</i>

16:23.237 --> 16:25.250
Mr. Monk,
I'm taking you off speakerphone.

16:28.328 --> 16:29.471
What happened?

16:29.545 --> 16:30.791
<i>What am I doing here?</i>

16:31.265 --> 16:34.132
He doesn't like me.
He never loved me.

16:34.536 --> 16:38.311
He doesn't love anyone
except for maybe Jack Junior.

16:38.442 --> 16:39.509
Jack Junior?

16:39.568 --> 16:40.671
<i>It's his other son.</i>

16:40.867 --> 16:43.220
He bought him a bike.
I never got a bike!

16:43.539 --> 16:44.903
There's another brother.

16:46.752 --> 16:50.113
Natalie,
can you pick me up?

16:50.394 --> 16:53.512
Mr. Monk, it's only been a few hours.
I don't think you should give up.

16:53.800 --> 16:54.945
Just keep talking.

16:54.979 --> 16:56.695
I'm sure you have
a lot in common.

16:56.823 --> 16:57.832
That makes sense.

16:57.871 --> 17:00.372
You made a lot of good points.
Now come and get me!

17:00.469 --> 17:02.404
Mr. Monk, I can't.
I can't just leave.

17:02.594 --> 17:05.338
I mean, for one thing
everybody but Julie has been drinking.

17:07.223 --> 17:08.527
He wants to talk to you.

17:20.213 --> 17:21.300
Mr. Monk, I can't.

17:24.468 --> 17:25.846
I don't have a license.

17:27.560 --> 17:29.558
<i>I don't even know
where Arizona is.</i>

17:31.663 --> 17:33.165
Please stop crying.

17:37.256 --> 17:38.284
He hung up.

18:05.585 --> 18:07.246
They're not as happy as they look.

18:19.177 --> 18:21.438
There.
You hear that again?

18:23.066 --> 18:24.237
Normally I'd check,

18:24.299 --> 18:26.238
but we're screwed
if we don't reach Phoenix.

18:26.333 --> 18:28.472
We gotta drop this load
and get to Yuma by 4:00.

18:29.229 --> 18:30.171
Yuma?

18:30.406 --> 18:33.281
But we just went through Yuma.
Why didn't we stop there first?

18:33.617 --> 18:35.505
Don't ask me.
Ask the itinerary.

18:36.362 --> 18:37.462
"San Francisco...

18:37.548 --> 18:40.454
"Phoenix, Yuma,
Tucson, Carson City."

18:41.331 --> 18:43.255
Well,
that doesn't make any sense.

18:43.256 --> 18:45.028
We're zigzagging
back and forth.

18:45.424 --> 18:46.578
What are we carrying?

18:46.637 --> 18:48.160
Toys.
Can you believe it?

18:48.707 --> 18:50.427
I got two bosses.
Partners.

18:50.825 --> 18:52.822
One of them, Ben Glaser,

18:52.922 --> 18:54.855
he marches into the office
last Tuesday

18:55.045 --> 18:57.355
and he announces that
he has found religion.

18:57.578 --> 18:58.979
Just like that
out of the blue.

18:59.055 --> 19:01.380
This is a guy who never
set foot in a church before.

19:02.484 --> 19:04.294
Then he goes and buys
a bunch of toys.

19:04.413 --> 19:07.079
He loads up the truck,
and he offered me five grand

19:07.114 --> 19:08.774
to drive around
and hand them out.

19:09.417 --> 19:10.781
I feel like Santa Claus.

19:11.170 --> 19:12.969
I even got a costume back there.

19:13.226 --> 19:14.827
Hey, you wanna be my elf?

19:16.134 --> 19:19.172
But why are we zigzagging
like this?

19:19.600 --> 19:21.035
It makes no sense.

19:21.283 --> 19:24.324
I asked him. He said he moved around
a lot when he was a kid.

19:24.586 --> 19:26.146
Foster homes, orphanages.

19:26.300 --> 19:28.933
He wanted to retrace his steps
city by city.

19:29.369 --> 19:31.054
What do I know?
He's the boss.

19:32.052 --> 19:33.831
I think we should take the 402.

19:34.012 --> 19:35.493
We gotta stick to the route.

19:35.612 --> 19:36.893
The 402 is a straight line.

19:36.972 --> 19:38.757
It would save us
an hour and a half.

19:39.855 --> 19:41.041
You know, you're right.

19:41.741 --> 19:43.124
It doesn't hurt to ask.

19:55.886 --> 19:56.874
Tiger Trucking.

19:56.914 --> 19:58.871
<i>Hey, hot stuff.
Jack Monk here.</i>

19:59.144 --> 20:01.378
I want to warn you before
you say anything naughty...

20:01.832 --> 20:03.030
I'm not here alone.

20:03.070 --> 20:04.845
- I'm here with my son.
- Hello.

20:05.287 --> 20:06.612
<i>Is that Jack Junior?</i>

20:06.778 --> 20:09.029
<i>Sweetheart,
I feel like I know you</i>

20:09.108 --> 20:11.114
<i>the way your daddy's always
bragging on you.</i>

20:11.213 --> 20:13.134
Every day he walks in with a new story.

20:13.193 --> 20:14.433
"Jack Junior said this.

20:14.527 --> 20:16.300
Jack Junior won another award."

20:17.734 --> 20:19.520
This is my other son,
Adrian.

20:19.895 --> 20:20.941
<i>Who?</i>

20:21.040 --> 20:23.354
Adrian, from a previous
administration.

20:23.600 --> 20:25.023
<i>You never mentioned him.</i>

20:25.586 --> 20:28.572
<i>I guess you really are
an international man of mystery.</i>

20:30.843 --> 20:33.892
Jack, you haven't heard
from Kenneth Woods, have you?

20:34.049 --> 20:35.393
<i>No. What happened?</i>

20:35.695 --> 20:37.378
Well, everyone's looking for him.

20:37.379 --> 20:39.003
Karen said she went out
shopping Monday

20:39.023 --> 20:40.111
and he just disappeared--

20:41.481 --> 20:42.607
Hey, Jack, it's Glaser.

20:42.667 --> 20:44.604
Yeah, how's our little
mission of mercy going?

20:44.663 --> 20:45.672
<i>So far so good.</i>

20:45.711 --> 20:47.084
<i>We're outside of Phoenix.</i>

20:48.250 --> 20:50.652
Ben, I was thinking
of shooting up the 402.

20:50.653 --> 20:52.552
No, no, what the hell
is wrong with you?

20:52.630 --> 20:54.726
Just stick with the route
that I gave you.

20:54.844 --> 20:57.002
It looks like I can save
about two hours.

20:57.091 --> 20:58.503
<i>There is construction</i>

20:58.538 --> 21:00.982
up and down the 402.
It's like a parking lot.

21:01.061 --> 21:02.568
I know what
I'm doing here, Monk.

21:02.603 --> 21:03.751
Okay?
Anything else?

21:04.697 --> 21:05.748
You're the boss.

21:06.104 --> 21:07.621
You bet I am.
Don't forget it.

21:13.149 --> 21:14.315
He found religion?

21:19.984 --> 21:21.536
Who's been good all year?

21:21.655 --> 21:23.953
Me! I've been good.

21:25.494 --> 21:26.601
Merry Christmas.

21:26.700 --> 21:28.542
Merry Christmas, Santa!

21:30.896 --> 21:32.642
Ah, what have we got?

21:32.996 --> 21:34.321
Let's see what we got.

21:35.132 --> 21:36.307
Let's see what we got.

21:36.491 --> 21:37.642
This is for you.

21:38.516 --> 21:40.297
The kids have been
looking forward to this

21:40.298 --> 21:41.851
ever since
Mr. Glaser called.

21:41.930 --> 21:43.373
It's like a miracle.

21:45.236 --> 21:46.570
This is for you.

21:47.526 --> 21:49.443
Isn't Santa Claus the greatest?

21:49.641 --> 21:52.122
Isn't he the greatest man
in the whole world?

21:52.208 --> 21:53.388
See what else we got.

21:54.441 --> 21:55.529
I don't know.

21:55.554 --> 21:56.953
This is for...you.

21:58.018 --> 21:59.141
I don't know him very well.

21:59.220 --> 22:01.055
This is for...you.

22:01.203 --> 22:02.921
Well, nobody
really knows him

22:02.955 --> 22:05.295
because he only
comes around once a year.

22:05.865 --> 22:07.088
An Easter bunny.

22:07.521 --> 22:08.675
That's correct.

22:08.853 --> 22:10.187
Who's Ronnie Milsap?

22:10.657 --> 22:11.838
I have no idea.

22:12.629 --> 22:13.686
What's this?

22:14.062 --> 22:15.074
<i>It's a dreidel.</i>

22:15.192 --> 22:16.307
What's it do?

22:16.703 --> 22:17.870
I don't know.

22:18.221 --> 22:22.117
I don't mean to seem ungrateful,
but who selected these toys?

22:27.693 --> 22:29.615
Spit it out.
Just spit it out.

22:37.498 --> 22:39.701
This is the worst
Christmas ever!

22:39.879 --> 22:41.550
Where did you get
all these stupid toys?

22:41.609 --> 22:42.976
At the dollar store?

22:43.055 --> 22:44.097
I hate you.

22:44.176 --> 22:46.560
- Kathy, you don't mean that.
- I do too mean it.

22:46.639 --> 22:47.955
I hate you to death.

22:47.988 --> 22:50.061
Go back to
the North Pole and die.

23:06.024 --> 23:07.067
What are you doing?

23:07.898 --> 23:10.488
Jack, there is
something wrong here.

23:10.983 --> 23:13.701
Look, a whole trailer
for six boxes?

23:14.729 --> 23:15.777
What are you looking for?

23:15.817 --> 23:17.575
I don't know.
Drugs maybe.

23:17.655 --> 23:20.254
- Drugs?
- Or guns, weapons.

23:20.287 --> 23:21.348
That's impossible.

23:21.407 --> 23:23.528
Well, at least it would
explain what's going on here.

23:23.568 --> 23:25.612
Your boss, this Glaser.

23:26.205 --> 23:28.314
I think--
I think he's using you.

23:28.549 --> 23:30.402
- For what?
- I don't know.

23:30.798 --> 23:32.815
But he did say he used
to be an orphan here.

23:32.848 --> 23:35.167
I was just upstairs.
I checked with the administrator.

23:35.200 --> 23:36.282
There's no record of him.

23:36.321 --> 23:38.096
You're checking up on my boss?

23:39.080 --> 23:40.543
What if he hears about it?

23:42.190 --> 23:43.700
What are you trying to do here?

23:43.810 --> 23:45.442
My job.
This is what I do.

23:45.477 --> 23:46.776
And I'm good at it.

23:46.993 --> 23:48.605
I know when something
feels wrong.

23:48.625 --> 23:49.982
Look at this.
Look.

23:51.060 --> 23:53.255
Shampoo, dog food,

23:53.594 --> 23:57.127
Q-tips,
Das Kapital by Karl--

23:57.166 --> 23:59.472
Put everything back in here.
You're gonna get me fired.

23:59.531 --> 24:00.584
Get it all back in.

24:00.975 --> 24:02.998
Think about it.
Think about it.

24:03.078 --> 24:05.099
He's making you drive 5,000 miles

24:05.317 --> 24:08.224
on back roads,
zigzagging back and forth

24:08.364 --> 24:09.521
to deliver this?

24:09.665 --> 24:10.798
All this junk?

24:11.088 --> 24:12.379
It doesn't make any sense.

24:12.415 --> 24:14.395
You want to know what
doesn't make any sense?

24:14.672 --> 24:16.198
You want to know
what doesn't?!

24:16.709 --> 24:20.287
This is the first day
we've been together in--in 40 years.

24:20.839 --> 24:22.697
Are you trying to help me?
No.

24:23.521 --> 24:25.340
You are trying
to sabotage me!

24:25.929 --> 24:28.723
I'm 68 years old!
You understand that?

24:28.901 --> 24:30.371
And nobody's
gonna hire me.

24:30.552 --> 24:31.787
I need this job!

24:33.437 --> 24:34.663
You're impossible.

24:35.888 --> 24:37.687
You've always been impossible.

24:38.176 --> 24:40.350
And your brother
and your mother too.

24:42.250 --> 24:43.986
Now I remember why I left.

24:45.561 --> 24:46.663
What did you say?

24:46.664 --> 24:49.669
Next time I bring Jack Junior.
Get the job done properly.

24:50.369 --> 24:52.162
You coming?
I gotta get out of here.

25:03.616 --> 25:04.960
You know where I am.

25:05.474 --> 25:07.354
Yeah,
I know where you are.

25:08.032 --> 25:10.345
You're just running out
to pick up some Chinese food.

26:40.090 --> 26:41.154
Tiger Trucking.

26:41.213 --> 26:42.732
Hey, Val.
It's me.

26:43.265 --> 26:44.799
Tell the man
I'm on schedule.

26:45.154 --> 26:46.392
I'm heading back to Yuma.

26:47.994 --> 26:50.367
He's a little busy right now.

26:51.128 --> 26:52.496
Something happened, Jack.

26:53.584 --> 26:56.387
Kenneth Woods is dead.
He was murdered.

26:56.505 --> 26:57.632
What?!

26:57.833 --> 27:00.954
<i>Two hunters found
his body in a gulch near the 209.</i>

27:02.150 --> 27:03.395
I don't believe it.

27:03.968 --> 27:06.250
- I just saw him at the Christmas party.
- I know.

27:06.300 --> 27:09.186
When they found him, he was still
wearing that tie you gave him.

27:09.403 --> 27:11.965
The police are here and
they're talking to everybody.

27:12.310 --> 27:13.400
Should I come in?

27:13.533 --> 27:14.733
<i>Uh, hold on.</i>

27:14.766 --> 27:17.363
It's Jack Monk!
He wants to know if he--

27:17.414 --> 27:18.583
You tell him no!

27:18.584 --> 27:20.015
Just tell him
to keep driving!

27:20.055 --> 27:21.255
Everything's fine!

27:21.579 --> 27:22.607
Did you hear that?

27:22.627 --> 27:23.995
Yeah, loud and clear.

27:24.406 --> 27:25.551
I'll check in later.

27:25.948 --> 27:27.191
Take care of yourself, Val.

27:27.408 --> 27:28.773
<i>You too.
Bye.</i>

27:41.114 --> 27:42.260
Where you bound?

27:42.398 --> 27:43.517
Yuma.

27:43.604 --> 27:45.146
Did you take a wrong turn?

27:45.663 --> 27:47.102
Shouldn't you be on the 402?

27:47.339 --> 27:49.751
The 402's a parking lot.
It's wall to wall.

27:49.844 --> 27:52.750
Where'd you hear that?
I've been on the 402 all day.

27:53.203 --> 27:55.002
It's wide open.
Clear sailing.

28:15.067 --> 28:16.317
How did you find me?

28:16.922 --> 28:19.353
I knew you'd walk in a straight line.
You always did.

28:19.972 --> 28:21.441
Ben Glaser lied to me.

28:21.684 --> 28:23.161
The 402's wide open.

28:23.970 --> 28:25.584
And his partner's been killed.

28:47.538 --> 28:48.961
So how was he killed?

28:49.642 --> 28:51.994
I didn't ask.
I didn't think to ask.

28:52.813 --> 28:54.454
You really believe
there's a connection

28:54.494 --> 28:56.609
between Kenneth Woods' murder
and me being sent out

28:56.668 --> 28:57.914
on this wild good chase?

28:57.973 --> 29:01.472
I don't know.
Seems like your boss, Mr. Glaser,

29:01.545 --> 29:02.771
wants you out of the way.

29:02.824 --> 29:04.326
Oh, that's impossible.

29:04.672 --> 29:05.957
I'm a great guy.

29:06.319 --> 29:08.336
Ask anybody who's not related to me.

29:10.944 --> 29:12.134
Here you go.

29:12.487 --> 29:13.500
Thanks.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.582
Two Christmas Specials.

29:16.040 --> 29:17.874
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

29:23.630 --> 29:24.817
It's touching.

29:27.223 --> 29:28.666
It is.
It's great.

29:29.281 --> 29:30.495
After all those years.

29:30.634 --> 29:33.512
No, I mean the food...
It's touching.

29:33.571 --> 29:36.616
Okay, okay, I forgot.
I forgot.

29:36.655 --> 29:38.967
Don't worry.
I'll fix it, I'll fix it.

29:39.183 --> 29:40.409
Don't worry.

29:41.786 --> 29:44.059
I forgot.
Carrots separate.

29:44.954 --> 29:46.140
Good?

29:46.972 --> 29:48.198
There you go.

29:48.919 --> 29:50.758
Nice and separate
turkey.

29:51.953 --> 29:53.060
Good?

29:55.835 --> 29:56.883
Thanks.

29:58.871 --> 30:00.196
You have a picture of her?

30:06.925 --> 30:08.171
Trudy, right?

30:08.724 --> 30:10.681
Oh. I'm glad.

30:12.711 --> 30:14.411
I'm glad
she was there for you.

30:19.052 --> 30:20.200
Okay, come on.

30:22.300 --> 30:24.241
So Detective,
what do we do now?

30:24.917 --> 30:26.790
- Call the police?
- Not yet.

30:27.270 --> 30:28.967
Your boss is up to something,

30:29.000 --> 30:31.127
but we still
don't know what.

30:31.713 --> 30:34.566
No, I think we should
stick to the route

30:34.600 --> 30:35.927
and drop off the toys.

30:36.295 --> 30:37.698
Just see what happens.

30:38.618 --> 30:39.863
Eat your carrots.

30:51.160 --> 30:52.455
I missed you.

31:02.326 --> 31:03.492
Good, huh?

31:53.802 --> 31:55.878
<i>Atticus One, this is Gumbo Pot.</i>

31:56.081 --> 31:57.148
<i>Thought you'd like to know</i>

31:57.168 --> 31:58.987
<i>you're coming up
on a plain brown wrapper.</i>

32:00.650 --> 32:01.741
Roger that.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.270
If we see it, we will
stop and pick it up.

32:04.421 --> 32:05.552
No!

32:05.553 --> 32:08.485
"Plain brown wrapper."
That's an unmarked police car.

32:08.757 --> 32:10.082
He's trying to warn us.

32:12.017 --> 32:13.796
Gumbo Pot,
this is Atticus One.

32:14.533 --> 32:17.014
You're making it harder
for the Highway Patrol

32:17.093 --> 32:18.992
to enforce
the local speed limit.

32:19.138 --> 32:20.753
Which isn't very cool.
Over.

32:21.099 --> 32:23.053
<i>Jack, who the hell is that?</i>

32:28.809 --> 32:29.995
What's this?

32:30.177 --> 32:31.299
<i>It's a GPS.</i>

32:31.852 --> 32:32.980
Eye in the sky.

32:33.138 --> 32:34.251
<i>5,000 miles.</i>

32:34.361 --> 32:35.438
<i>It's a memory chip.</i>

32:35.555 --> 32:37.770
It remembers the last
5,000 miles that you drove.

32:45.813 --> 32:46.933
What are you doing?

32:47.996 --> 32:49.949
You started in Texas, right?

32:50.063 --> 32:52.256
Then we drove from
San Francisco to Phoenix

32:52.360 --> 32:53.556
to Carson City.

32:54.774 --> 32:56.751
That's about 5,000 miles.

32:57.538 --> 32:59.475
<i>4,998.</i>

33:03.994 --> 33:06.290
Jack, pull over!
Stop the truck.

33:11.127 --> 33:12.919
Tell me about your boss.
Is he a driver?

33:12.978 --> 33:13.956
He used to be.

33:13.990 --> 33:15.704
Does he ever borrow
any of these trucks?

33:15.803 --> 33:17.822
Yeah, all the time.
How do you know that?

33:18.514 --> 33:19.720
Here's what happened.

33:20.113 --> 33:22.322
Ben Glaser borrowed a truck.
This truck.

33:22.421 --> 33:24.417
And he drove out to see
Kenneth Woods.

33:24.457 --> 33:25.687
They must've had a fight.

33:25.747 --> 33:27.299
Makes sense.
They hated each other.

33:27.397 --> 33:29.690
Ben killed Kenneth,
and he hid his body.

33:29.747 --> 33:30.892
But he had a problem.

33:31.000 --> 33:33.824
There was a record
of where he had driven that day.

33:33.859 --> 33:35.057
- Big Brother!
- Right.

33:35.118 --> 33:37.294
And he knew that eventually
the cops would check

33:37.329 --> 33:39.983
the GPS computer.
He had to erase it and quick.

33:40.022 --> 33:43.324
He had to put 5,000
more miles on this truck

33:43.755 --> 33:45.098
so the box would reset.

33:45.177 --> 33:47.547
And he sends me out
on this wild goose chase.

33:47.764 --> 33:50.364
Son of a bitch bastard!
Excuse my language.

33:50.423 --> 33:52.992
- It's okay. I'm a trucker.
- It's unbelievable. You solved it.

33:53.031 --> 33:56.485
You did it. You don't even know
these people, and you solved the case!

33:56.525 --> 33:58.786
Just like when I used to read
Sherlock Holmes to you.

33:58.845 --> 34:00.429
You'd figure it out
by page two.

34:01.359 --> 34:02.536
What about the proof?

34:02.595 --> 34:05.059
This truck is the proof.
It's all the evidence we need.

34:05.302 --> 34:07.396
As long as we can keep
this under 5,000 miles.

34:07.630 --> 34:10.223
The District Attorney
can introduce the memory chip

34:10.257 --> 34:12.202
from the satellite--
Why is this thing moving?

34:12.281 --> 34:13.634
Is this thing broken?

34:14.822 --> 34:16.143
Come on.
Uh, Jack.

34:18.433 --> 34:20.373
What do you mean "uh-oh?"
What does that mean?

34:20.433 --> 34:21.764
It can mean a variety of things,

34:21.764 --> 34:24.612
but in this case,
it means no brakes.

34:40.840 --> 34:42.460
Do it again!
Pump the thing!

34:42.601 --> 34:43.905
Turn some knobs!

34:44.004 --> 34:45.842
You haven't even
touched these buttons!

34:50.880 --> 34:52.047
Look out!

35:03.665 --> 35:04.915
Jump out and save yourself.

35:04.954 --> 35:07.604
I can't.
I can't just leave you here.

35:13.553 --> 35:15.232
- There's gotta be a runoff.
- What?

35:15.266 --> 35:17.372
It's a little side road
for trucks in trouble.

35:17.609 --> 35:18.912
Look for a runoff!

35:21.680 --> 35:22.868
- There it is!
- Where?

35:22.888 --> 35:24.867
Oh, we just passed it.
You have to turn around.

35:24.930 --> 35:27.133
- Turn around!
- I gotta say something.

35:27.614 --> 35:29.791
I'm sorry I wasn't there
for you and Ambrose.

35:30.167 --> 35:31.295
I'm so sorry.

35:31.433 --> 35:33.515
Oh, I'm a bad father.
That's all that matters.

35:33.594 --> 35:35.875
You're not a bad father.
Look at Jack Junior.

35:36.014 --> 35:37.669
- He's a putz!
- What?

35:37.755 --> 35:39.403
Actually, he's not
even a putz.

35:39.564 --> 35:41.851
He dreams one day
of becoming a putz.

35:42.266 --> 35:44.050
He lives downstairs
in my basement.

35:44.129 --> 35:45.770
He smokes pot all day long.

35:45.847 --> 35:47.512
He steals money from my wallet.

35:47.848 --> 35:49.336
He's not a doctor?

35:49.512 --> 35:52.141
No, I made it up.
I lied.

35:52.245 --> 35:55.171
I wanted to have a son
that I could be proud of.

35:55.279 --> 35:57.436
I didn't know I had one
in San Francisco.

36:02.159 --> 36:04.119
Dad, there it is!
There's another runoff!

36:29.033 --> 36:30.300
Are you okay?

36:34.288 --> 36:35.332
You called me Dad.

36:37.269 --> 36:39.467
There goes the case.
It's all been erased.

36:40.121 --> 36:42.612
I guess your boss is gonna
get away with murder.

36:44.404 --> 36:45.686
You called me Dad.

37:02.990 --> 37:04.651
I cleaned out his desk.

37:05.542 --> 37:07.418
Oh, yeah, thank you.

37:07.570 --> 37:08.651
Valarie,
let me take that.

37:08.652 --> 37:11.051
You know, look,
people, listen up.

37:11.052 --> 37:12.519
I know this is a tough time.

37:12.678 --> 37:14.789
And as Kenneth used to say,

37:15.323 --> 37:16.975
this is more than just an office.

37:17.203 --> 37:20.030
Y'all are family. And I think that's how
we're gonna get through this.

37:20.089 --> 37:21.715
By just supporting each other

37:22.958 --> 37:24.237
like a family.

37:28.207 --> 37:29.650
It's Jack Monk.

37:39.175 --> 37:40.895
Well, better late than never.

37:41.201 --> 37:43.536
Now who is this?
Come on now.

37:43.694 --> 37:46.847
You know the rule about
passengers riding in the cab.

37:46.927 --> 37:49.535
And you the rule
about killing your partner.

37:49.950 --> 37:51.169
Hello, Ben.

37:51.526 --> 37:52.970
Told you we might be back.

37:53.460 --> 37:55.397
This is a warrant
for your arrest.

37:55.872 --> 37:57.183
You've gotta be kidding me.

37:57.242 --> 37:59.002
We've gone all through this stuff.

37:59.056 --> 38:00.881
You were with your
partner, Kenneth Woods,

38:00.940 --> 38:02.621
when he was killed.
We can prove that.

38:04.088 --> 38:05.819
Jack, who the hell is this guy?

38:05.872 --> 38:07.034
He's my son.

38:07.035 --> 38:08.214
I don't believe this.

38:08.269 --> 38:11.120
Some orthopedist from Baltimore
is accusing me--

38:11.264 --> 38:12.507
This is another son.

38:12.586 --> 38:14.659
Adrian.
A homicide detective.

38:14.902 --> 38:15.969
Ex-detective.

38:16.009 --> 38:17.650
I hope to be reinstated soon.

38:18.277 --> 38:19.483
You didn't apply yet?

38:19.602 --> 38:22.002
- Dad, I'm fine, all right.
- You want me to make a call?

38:22.003 --> 38:23.686
Okay, look, I can
take care of myself.

38:23.687 --> 38:25.099
You were in this truck,

38:25.220 --> 38:27.354
this particular truck
the day Kenneth disappeared.

38:27.849 --> 38:28.964
We saw the sign-out sheet.

38:29.068 --> 38:31.753
That's right.
I borrowed it, and I went fishing.

38:32.257 --> 38:33.657
Now can you prove that I didn't?

38:33.658 --> 38:35.809
Because if you're talking
about the GPS system,

38:35.987 --> 38:38.033
that thing's already been erased.

38:38.633 --> 38:40.405
It's only got a 5,000-mile memory.

38:40.583 --> 38:43.500
We don't need a GPS
system to prove anything.

38:43.783 --> 38:45.424
There was this loud noise

38:45.484 --> 38:47.243
like a-- Yeah, it
was like a rattle--

38:47.451 --> 38:49.050
Rattle--
Flutter--

38:49.084 --> 38:50.549
Flutter driving us crazy.

38:50.683 --> 38:53.142
We figured,
it's gotta be a fan belt.

38:53.447 --> 38:54.870
It wasn't a fan belt.

38:58.937 --> 39:01.783
Mr. Glaser, can you explain
how part of the victim's necktie

39:01.784 --> 39:02.917
was found in a vehicle

39:03.167 --> 39:04.550
you were driving?

39:29.505 --> 39:30.909
I'll be with you in a minute.

39:36.723 --> 39:37.929
Merry Christmas!

39:39.942 --> 39:42.434
I--I didn't
get you anything.

39:42.827 --> 39:44.234
Oh, yes, you did.

39:45.497 --> 39:48.634
Here, it's all yours.
I'll be right with you.

39:49.404 --> 39:50.709
Your first bike.

39:50.834 --> 39:52.664
Get on.
I'll be holding you.

39:52.865 --> 39:54.446
Go ahead.
Don't be afraid.

39:55.325 --> 39:56.799
That's it.
Now I got you.

39:56.878 --> 39:59.177
- Don't let go.
- So there's nothing to be afraid of.

39:59.513 --> 40:00.774
Are you ready, sir?

40:01.181 --> 40:03.415
Okay, start pedaling.
Let's go.

40:03.723 --> 40:04.967
- Slowly.
- Don't let go.

40:05.316 --> 40:06.957
I'm not.
Okay.

40:07.399 --> 40:09.237
Go straight, go straight.

40:09.600 --> 40:11.583
That's it.
Make a turn now.

40:11.662 --> 40:13.534
To the left.
Easy, easy.

40:13.667 --> 40:15.176
Easy.
That's it.

40:15.215 --> 40:16.667
Pedal a little faster.

40:16.728 --> 40:18.329
Oh, you're doing great.

40:18.615 --> 40:20.134
You got it.
You got it.

40:21.233 --> 40:23.092
You got it!
Look at you!

40:23.581 --> 40:25.901
That's it, like you've been
doing it all these years.

40:26.019 --> 40:27.443
Dad, can I get
some mud flaps?

40:27.523 --> 40:28.745
Come on.
Yes, you can.

40:29.801 --> 40:31.288
That's my boy!
Come on.

40:33.219 --> 40:34.301
Big circle.

40:35.242 --> 40:36.487
Big circle.

40:36.720 --> 40:38.750
Keep your eye on the road.
I'm with you.

40:39.236 --> 40:41.067
That's it.
Pedal harder.

40:41.304 --> 40:43.281
Keep pedaling.
Go straight.

40:43.479 --> 40:46.530
Straight, straight.
Go ahead, go ahead.

40:46.649 --> 40:47.973
Hey, Dad, watch this.

40:48.289 --> 40:49.495
Go ahead.

40:50.365 --> 40:51.551
That's my boy.

40:53.871 --> 40:55.137
Come back.
Come towards me.

40:55.287 --> 40:57.126
The finish line.
Will he make it?

40:57.552 --> 40:58.659
Yes!

41:00.846 --> 41:02.210
Let me hear the bell.

41:02.862 --> 41:03.989
That a boy.

41:04.693 --> 41:07.144
