00:00.067 --> 00:05.172
-Neil, thank you for doing this.
-My pleasure. This is gonna be fun.

00:05.239 --> 00:08.442
I want to tell you something,
'cause you've hosted everything.

00:08.509 --> 00:11.845
-The Oscars, The Emmys, The Tonys...
-Not bad, yeah.

00:11.912 --> 00:16.450
I know you like big dance numbers,
so I wanted to do something really special

00:16.517 --> 00:21.088
to show you
how excited I am about you being here.

00:21.088 --> 00:24.157
-Like, an opening number?
-Yeah, don't you love that?

00:24.224 --> 00:26.226
Well, I'd love it in the right context.

00:26.293 --> 00:30.764
Like, in an award show where there's lots
of people. But, this is more intimate.

00:30.831 --> 00:34.101
So you think a big dance number
is a bad idea?

00:35.536 --> 00:36.904
Okay, sorry.

00:45.145 --> 00:47.347
Did you choreograph this yourself?

00:47.414 --> 00:50.751
-I worked with BeyoncÃ©'s dancers on it.
-Wow.

00:50.817 --> 00:52.619
Yeah.

01:07.401 --> 01:09.436
Don't you think it's pretty cool, though?

01:09.503 --> 01:11.572
It's big.

01:12.840 --> 01:14.341
Yeah.

01:25.452 --> 01:26.920
Oh. Oh.

01:27.888 --> 01:29.122
Spared no expense.

01:30.624 --> 01:32.359
Yeah. I kind of do things big.

01:37.130 --> 01:40.334
-OK. Shall we go?
-Let's do this.

02:42.095 --> 02:44.131
-Hey. How you doin'?
-What's up?

02:45.332 --> 02:47.334
Don't believe me, you don't wanna watch?

02:47.401 --> 02:51.104
She's like: "I'm on the phone,
leave me the hell alone."

02:55.008 --> 02:56.944
I love your high note.

03:01.281 --> 03:02.649
So, you're doing...

03:02.716 --> 03:07.321
Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate
Events. A very short title.

03:07.387 --> 03:10.224
And you're in crazy makeup,
like I have to do for Madea?

03:10.290 --> 03:13.861
Oh, that's true.
How many Madea movies have you made?

03:13.927 --> 03:18.498
I don't know.
It's been a lot of them damn things.

03:18.565 --> 03:22.069
I think about 9, 10, 12 or 15.

03:22.069 --> 03:26.740
I don't know, but I did 20-something in
a play for a long time on the road.

03:26.807 --> 03:29.309
Girl, you did a one-woman show.

03:29.376 --> 03:33.413
Well, no. I had people on the show,
but I was the big chick.

03:33.480 --> 03:35.082
-You were the star.
-Yes.

03:35.082 --> 03:38.385
It was my name they were coming to see.

03:38.452 --> 03:42.356
I had issues with Diana Ross and all those
people. I wouldn't let them come.

03:42.422 --> 03:45.626
-Why is that?
-OK, I'll tell you a story.

03:45.692 --> 03:46.960
No, it's a real story.

03:47.094 --> 03:52.099
I was in the Kodak Theatre doing my show.
Prince was in the audience.

03:52.165 --> 03:56.303
But before he came, I got a phone call.
I say hello, and he's like:

03:56.370 --> 03:59.706
"Tyler, I hear you're doing my song
'Purple Rain' in the show."

03:59.773 --> 04:03.577
I said: "Yeah, I've been playing with it."
"Do it again, and I'll sue you."

04:03.644 --> 04:07.314
That's what he said.
I'm dead quiet on the phone.

04:07.381 --> 04:10.551
-Did you know Prince before?
-No. And then he says:

04:10.617 --> 04:13.887
"And I need ten tickets.
I'll be there tonight."

04:13.954 --> 04:18.325
So, he comes.
I'm backstage thinking: "Is he serious?"

04:18.392 --> 04:22.062
I'm scared to death.
So, he comes backstage.

04:22.095 --> 04:25.065
He gets out of the limo.
He's got his high-heels on.

04:25.132 --> 04:28.202
I refuse to get the costume
until I meet him.

04:28.268 --> 04:32.306
And he comes in laughing.
He is like: "I was joking, kind of."

04:32.372 --> 04:36.710
So, I go on stage, and there's this moment
where we're doing this medley

04:36.777 --> 04:39.613
of old songs. And I hit the lick, right.

04:39.680 --> 04:43.550
And I look at him,
and he nods for me to do it.

04:43.617 --> 04:49.089
So, we start doing the song. I send the
microphone to him in the audience.

04:50.090 --> 04:52.092
-He started singing "Purple Rain".
-Stop it.

04:52.159 --> 04:55.729
I got 20 minutes left of the show.
He wiped the place out.

04:55.863 --> 04:59.399
People were going nuts.
I couldn't get the audience back.

04:59.466 --> 05:03.036
So, it's like: "I'll teach you.
You'll never mess with me again."

05:03.103 --> 05:06.106
So, that's why Madea
wants no other people...

05:06.173 --> 05:10.878
Nobody will be in my show
again. I couldn't get the audience back.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.685
I want to thank all of ya'll
for coming out tonight...

05:18.752 --> 05:21.188
I have an imaginary crowd.

05:23.423 --> 05:26.527
I love this song. Yeah, there it is.
It's all the way up there.

05:26.593 --> 05:30.531
-I like how he forgets that he started.
-Yeah, that's exactly what happens.

05:33.567 --> 05:35.636
-Wait, what?
-I wasn't supposed to start?

05:35.702 --> 05:39.773
-OK. Another round? Bring me in.
-OK. Now.

05:56.123 --> 05:57.457
What?

06:01.461 --> 06:03.530
You're not singing.
Do the high part.

06:04.631 --> 06:06.500
Thank you.

06:06.567 --> 06:09.636
Gotta stay right up...

06:12.172 --> 06:14.641
-That's it.
-I can't sing in any other way now.

06:16.310 --> 06:17.845
I'm locked in.

06:31.725 --> 06:33.327
That's so sad.

06:34.061 --> 06:36.063
So many people had sex to that song.

06:36.063 --> 06:38.398
But, it ends so sad.
"I'll never be with you."

06:38.465 --> 06:42.569
-Doesn't sex usually, though?
-End sad? Yeah.

06:44.104 --> 06:46.073
-No, it doesn't.
-Was it sexy...?

06:46.073 --> 06:49.643
-You agreed. That didn't throw you.
-Yeah. It does end sad.

06:53.146 --> 06:55.148
What was the first song you had sex to?

06:57.251 --> 07:00.020
I hardly remember.
It was not a great experience.

07:00.087 --> 07:02.155
-Okay.
-You?

07:03.690 --> 07:05.425
Rick James.

07:10.097 --> 07:12.466
So, it was really fast.

07:35.923 --> 07:39.059
-Oh. Here we go, TP.
-Yeah, I got it.

07:39.092 --> 07:40.427
I'm with you.

07:42.829 --> 07:45.265
-No, we're early.
-Too early? OK.

07:46.233 --> 07:47.701
-No.
-Too early. Hold on.

07:47.768 --> 07:48.735
Here we go.

08:26.039 --> 08:27.341
-She just said that.
-I know.

08:27.407 --> 08:30.711
And I was just like:
"What is she saying?"

08:30.777 --> 08:35.048
-"Tin roof, rusted."
-She said it. It wasn't in the lyrics.

08:35.048 --> 08:37.317
-And it became their catchphrase.
-I love it.

08:37.384 --> 08:41.554
At the love shack

08:44.091 --> 08:47.294
-You love magic, right?
-Love magic.

08:47.361 --> 08:51.832
-Why do you love magic so much?
-I dunno. It was my hobby growing up.

08:51.899 --> 08:54.902
I love the juggling, the circus acts,
the sword swallowers...

08:54.968 --> 08:56.170
Do you juggle too?

08:56.236 --> 08:59.072
I juggle, as well. I breathe fire.

08:59.072 --> 09:02.743
-That's a lot about you I didn't know.
-I'm a carny at heart.

09:02.809 --> 09:05.045
I have a deck of cards.
Wanna see a card trick?

09:05.112 --> 09:08.482
-While you're driving?
-No, I should probably pull over.

09:08.549 --> 09:11.051
That might be better.

09:11.118 --> 09:13.086
Deck of cards...

09:13.153 --> 09:18.592
I'm not saying that I'm a great magician,
by any stretch of the imagination.

09:18.659 --> 09:22.462
Because, as I said, there's other people
who are way stronger at it.

09:22.529 --> 09:24.865
So, I'll just do
the simplest of card tricks.

09:24.932 --> 09:27.534
I'm gonna riffle through the deck.
Say stop.

09:27.601 --> 09:29.102
-Stop.
-Right there?

09:29.169 --> 09:32.172
Don't take the four of hearts,
but the card that you cut to.

09:32.239 --> 09:35.175
Look at it.
Show everybody what it is.

09:36.577 --> 09:39.646
And then put it back in the deck,
anywhere you like.

09:41.281 --> 09:44.918
I'm going to divine your card
in the craziest of ways.

09:45.052 --> 09:46.587
I'm going to...

09:47.221 --> 09:50.524
hurl them against the window.
Watch this.

09:54.661 --> 09:56.430
There's one card there.

09:56.496 --> 09:58.131
Is that outside of the car?

10:00.100 --> 10:02.169
As a matter of fact, I think it is.

10:04.471 --> 10:06.473
How the hell did you do that?

10:09.510 --> 10:12.579
-How'd you do that?
-Is that your card? Six of hearts?

10:12.646 --> 10:14.581
Yeah. How'd you do that?

10:16.149 --> 10:17.684
It's magic, man.

10:18.418 --> 10:20.454
We should do a magic act together.

10:21.255 --> 10:24.892
Will you tell me how you did that
if we do it together?

10:24.958 --> 10:29.463
Well, we'd have to share secrets.
I know The Magic Castle.

10:29.530 --> 10:33.100
A private club for magicians. I was
the president there. Why don't we go

10:33.100 --> 10:38.705
get an audience of people together to see
a show, and we'll put on a big giant...

10:38.772 --> 10:41.708
-We'll start a new duo.
-Let's do it.

10:42.509 --> 10:44.211
We have to find people.

10:44.278 --> 10:49.016
Tourists would be good.
Where do we find a bunch of tourists?

10:52.753 --> 10:55.255
-There. Pull them over.
-Bus tour.

10:55.322 --> 10:57.691
Pull them over.

10:57.758 --> 10:59.193
-Yeah.
-Here we go.

10:59.259 --> 11:02.696
That's the one, right there.
That completely works.

11:03.830 --> 11:05.098
-Hey.
-Hey, guys.

11:06.099 --> 11:07.601
-Hey.
-How are you?

11:07.668 --> 11:10.804
What's going on? So, listen.

11:11.505 --> 11:14.708
This is, Tyler Perry presents
Neil Patrick Harris.

11:14.775 --> 11:16.810
And I want all of you guys to come with...

11:16.877 --> 11:20.113
-Yeah we wanna do a special...
-Tell 'em, Neil.

11:20.180 --> 11:22.683
Tell 'em where you want 'em to go, Neil.

11:22.749 --> 11:25.686
We wanna go to a special place.

11:25.752 --> 11:30.090
We want you to see the first
performance by a new magic duo.

11:30.090 --> 11:32.793
-Yes, we're a new magic group.
-Tyler Perry presents.

11:32.860 --> 11:36.697
Tyler Perry's Tyler Perry
and Neil Patrick Harris

11:36.763 --> 11:39.466
in a magic duo. You guys in?

11:39.533 --> 11:41.335
Yeah!

11:41.401 --> 11:44.371
-OK. Follow us.
-I'll see you over there.

11:45.372 --> 11:48.408
Are you sure you can get us
in here? This place looks closed.

11:48.475 --> 11:51.545
We got a big group here.
We can't be embarrassing ourselves.

11:51.612 --> 11:53.146
I used to work here.

11:53.213 --> 11:57.284
He does not look like
he's gonna let us in here.

12:00.020 --> 12:03.957
Hey, Ben. How are you, buddy?
I have a huge favor to ask.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.793
I'm here with
American superstar Tyler Perry.

12:06.860 --> 12:09.796
Hey. He's Neil Patrick Harris.
He used to be the president.

12:09.863 --> 12:13.367
-He looks familiar, yeah.
-He's Neil Patrick Harris.

12:13.433 --> 12:15.769
I showed him a magic trick in the car.

12:15.836 --> 12:19.606
So I thought, in the spirit of Siegfried
&amp; Roy we should do a two person act.

12:19.673 --> 12:23.177
Can we just slip in for a minute
for a quick performance?

12:23.243 --> 12:25.312
Everybody cool. We got it under control.

12:25.379 --> 12:27.748
-We'll do one and out.
-You got it.

12:27.814 --> 12:31.552
-Do you have an assistant we could borrow?
-We can find someone inside.

12:31.618 --> 12:34.655
Get off the bus! C'mon!

12:47.634 --> 12:51.338
Good evening, ladies
and gentlemen. Please enjoy

12:51.405 --> 12:57.544
Tyler Perry presenting Tyler Perry's magic
tricks presented by Tyler Perry studios,

12:57.611 --> 13:01.381
featuring Tyler Perry
and Neil Patrick Harris

13:01.448 --> 13:03.116
Okay, enough.

13:20.601 --> 13:21.435
What?

13:38.185 --> 13:39.286
Bam!

13:46.760 --> 13:48.795
Watch!

13:59.973 --> 14:01.909
I killed it. I killed it.

14:04.878 --> 14:07.047
Thank you.

14:09.383 --> 14:12.953
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

14:13.754 --> 14:19.493
Thank you. Thank you, all.

14:19.560 --> 14:23.197
Thank you so much. Thank you.
Thank you so much.

14:23.263 --> 14:27.334
Thank you, all. We thank you.
Thank you so much.

14:27.401 --> 14:30.070
Thank you, all. Thank you.

14:34.441 --> 14:37.845
-How cool was that?
-I think we crushed it.

14:37.911 --> 14:42.115
-I'm not sure we should do that again.
-Yeah, but it was cool.

14:42.182 --> 14:44.084
Where'd that girl come from?

14:44.084 --> 14:46.320
Hey, man. I was pretty impressed.

14:46.386 --> 14:50.257
There's only one way to end
a day like this. Something special.

14:50.324 --> 14:51.792
Like what?

14:57.631 --> 14:58.465
Wow.

15:03.737 --> 15:06.673
-This is so nice...

15:06.740 --> 15:10.244
And I owe it all to you,
Neil Patrick Harris

15:10.310 --> 15:15.415
-Yes. Sing to me.

15:15.482 --> 15:16.483
Yes. Right key.

15:20.521 --> 15:24.057
-Yeah.
-Why do I always have to do the high part?

15:35.536 --> 15:37.104
There you go!

16:04.932 --> 16:10.170
We butchered the lyrics and melody.
But we still nailed the spirit.

16:10.237 --> 16:14.174
And we would've killed the dancing
if we had not been inside this car.

16:14.241 --> 16:18.178
-We rehearsed that for weeks.
-You would run. I would've picked you up.

16:18.245 --> 16:22.482
-Maybe through the sunroof?
-The sunroof. Yes.
