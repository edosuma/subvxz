Dallas using her dog
to avoid George

00:54.512 --> 00:56.931

What a day. Let's see.

Victor taught me how to play
"World of Warcraft."

that he's an advisor

01:12.238 --> 01:14.324

01:14.365 --> 01:16.451
Well, he is. I know, right?

01:16.493 --> 01:17.577

went for coffee--

my blazer on, okay?

That means I'm in work mode.

- No, no, and neither did I.

But that doesn't mean
we should not apologize.

- Right.

I need to get Biederman

09:02.833 --> 09:04.460

a present?

09:15.555 --> 09:18.307
Because, Victor,
when empty apologies fail

09:18.349 --> 09:19.767
sometimes, we must resort to--

09:19.809 --> 09:21.978

- Romance.

In fact, on the day we married

09:25.731 --> 09:27.441
a pair of hummingbirds
hovered above

09:27.483 --> 09:29.652
as we exchanged our vows.

09:29.694 --> 09:32.113
Hopefully this feeder
will remind her of that day

09:32.154 --> 09:34.991
and...all the glorious days
since.

09:35.032 --> 09:37.410
And then she'll let you
touch her boobies?

09:37.451 --> 09:40.288
In a perfect world, yes.

09:40.329 --> 09:42.582
Are you sure we're not related?

09:48.045 --> 09:50.131
(Nora)
I would argue
that's not the best kibble.

09:50.172 --> 09:52.133
With a dog like Biederman, you
are gonna want to go grain-free.

09:52.174 --> 09:53.217
It's easier on his system.

09:53.259 --> 09:55.052
Yeah, when you say "Grain-free"

09:55.094 --> 09:57.513
I hear "Unreasonably expensive."

09:57.555 --> 09:59.348
Well, when you say
"Unreasonably expensive"

09:59.390 --> 10:02.268
I hear "Kind of a cheap ass."

10:02.310 --> 10:04.729
- What about..
- Oh, hey.

10:04.770 --> 10:06.063
What do you know about coffee?

10:06.105 --> 10:08.316
Holy crap.
What-what about wet food?

10:08.357 --> 10:11.193
(Nora)
'Wet food's good for protein
but it's kind of fattening.'

10:11.235 --> 10:14.363
And so with a dog his size,
you don't.. What are you doing?

10:14.405 --> 10:18.200
What? Oh, I'm just, uh, looking
at the, the calorie content.

10:18.242 --> 10:22.079
I'm, I'm a little nearsighted,
so this helps me.

10:22.121 --> 10:24.665
Are you hiding? Because that
is not a very good hiding place.

10:24.707 --> 10:28.753
It's Dallas.
She's right over there.

10:28.794 --> 10:32.089
Wow. I guess Tessa
wasn't kidding about that map.

10:32.131 --> 10:33.716
What happened to Kajagoogoo?

10:33.758 --> 10:35.217
Oh, you know damn well
they've been irrelevant

10:35.259 --> 10:36.260
since the '80s.

10:36.302 --> 10:37.970
George had underestimated

10:38.012 --> 10:39.639
how seeing Dallas
was going to make him feel.

10:39.680 --> 10:41.390
And now that the reality
had hit him

10:41.432 --> 10:43.851
he had no other choice but to..

10:43.893 --> 10:45.227
Uh, what are you doing?

10:45.269 --> 10:46.646
I'm climbing
into the shopping cart.

10:46.687 --> 10:47.938
Give me your hand.
Help stabilize me.

10:47.980 --> 10:49.190
- Oh!
- Stabilize me!

10:49.231 --> 10:50.566
[grunts]

10:50.608 --> 10:53.653
Now, grab those two
economy-sized bags

10:53.694 --> 10:54.987
and lay them over me.

10:55.029 --> 10:57.073
Go ahead. Just lay them over me.

10:58.032 --> 10:59.408
[grunts]

11:05.122 --> 11:07.333
Now what?

11:07.375 --> 11:09.335
(George)
'Use the express lane.'

11:10.503 --> 11:12.088
[grunts]

11:17.385 --> 11:18.928
[indistinct chatter on TV]

11:18.969 --> 11:19.970
Things had been
a little tense with Lisa

11:20.012 --> 11:21.097
since the yogurt incident

11:21.138 --> 11:22.765
but it was nothing a little

11:22.807 --> 11:25.142
DVR'd "Croc-nami" couldn't fix.

11:25.184 --> 11:28.020
It's nice to see
Shannen Doherty starting over

11:28.062 --> 11:31.691
after losing six small children
in the Croc-nami.

11:31.732 --> 11:34.318
- She's very fertile.
- She is.

11:34.360 --> 11:36.112
And..

11:36.153 --> 11:37.655
...I like that
she's attempting a water birth.

11:37.697 --> 11:40.366
Oh, yeah,
that's very courageous.

11:40.408 --> 11:43.369
Did you notice her midwife
is wearing crocs?

11:43.411 --> 11:45.079
I didn't catch that
the first time.

11:45.121 --> 11:46.831
(man on TV)
'Push, Jessica, push!'

11:46.872 --> 11:49.458
'Push my baby out of you!'

11:49.500 --> 11:51.711
Your first time?

11:51.752 --> 11:54.797
Well, I was at June's house
the night it aired..

11:54.839 --> 11:58.384
And don't look. She's about
to give birth to a crocodile.

11:59.635 --> 12:01.554
- Aah.
- Thanks.

12:01.595 --> 12:03.264
Thank you for ruining the ending

12:03.305 --> 12:07.101
and, also, for taking
a giant croc on our friendship.

12:07.143 --> 12:10.062
Tessa! But, Tessa, when they
come back from commercial

12:10.104 --> 12:12.690
she's gonna try breast-feeding.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.316
"Oh, thank you, Fred!"

12:14.358 --> 12:17.403
"I love my bird feeder
and I love you."

12:17.445 --> 12:19.739
"That was so thoughtful."

12:19.780 --> 12:21.991
"Why don't you go ahead
and touch my boobies?"

12:22.032 --> 12:23.576
[chuckles]
Yes!

12:23.617 --> 12:26.203
From your mouth to Sheila's.

12:26.245 --> 12:27.913
- Sheila!
- Mom!

12:27.955 --> 12:29.749
What happened to your eye?

12:29.790 --> 12:32.042
What didn't?

12:32.084 --> 12:34.545
I had no idea that your father
turned our backyard

12:34.587 --> 12:36.464
into a wildlife preserve
when I stepped out there

12:36.505 --> 12:38.299
with my morning coffee.

12:38.340 --> 12:40.176
It was like something
out of a Hitchcock movie.

12:40.217 --> 12:42.470
They descended upon our haven,
thirsty for blood.

12:44.513 --> 12:48.058
One of them went rogue and made
a beeline right for my cornea.

12:48.100 --> 12:50.394
[screaming]

12:50.436 --> 12:52.021
And now I'm blind in one eye.

12:52.062 --> 12:53.856
[scoffs]
Blind in one eye?

12:53.898 --> 12:56.066
- Oh, come on.
- Well, I can't see.

12:56.108 --> 12:58.235
That's because you're wearing
an eye patch!

12:58.277 --> 12:59.737
Why am I wearing
an eye patch, Fred?

12:59.779 --> 13:01.405
Why am I wearing an eye patch?

13:01.447 --> 13:04.742
Um, because your loving husband
tried to bring the romance

13:04.784 --> 13:07.244
of songbirds
back into your life.

13:07.286 --> 13:10.623
Does this look like romance?
Does this look like romance?

13:11.791 --> 13:13.793
No. That looks infected.

13:15.711 --> 13:17.129
After some soul-searching

13:17.171 --> 13:19.215
George and I came
to the same conclusion.

13:19.256 --> 13:21.842
Maybe drawing some boundaries
wasn't a bad idea after all.

13:21.884 --> 13:25.095
Tessa...I'm so sorry
about the other night.

13:25.137 --> 13:26.597
That kind of thing
will never happen again.

13:26.639 --> 13:28.349
You're right. It won't.

13:28.390 --> 13:30.518
Because I came up with a plan
to make sure it doesn't.

13:30.559 --> 13:31.811
'June and I will have you on'

13:31.852 --> 13:33.687
'alternate weekends
and holidays.'

13:33.729 --> 13:35.648
Additionally, we'll each
have you to ourselves

13:35.689 --> 13:37.525
on our respective birthdays.

13:37.566 --> 13:39.860
I just don't know
how to handle yours.

13:41.278 --> 13:43.739
You know what?
Don't even stress about that.

13:43.781 --> 13:46.116
I'll celebrate my birthday
alone, in a closet

13:46.158 --> 13:48.869
so that neither one of you
feels slighted.

13:48.911 --> 13:50.579
That works for me.

13:57.503 --> 13:58.546
What's all this?

13:58.587 --> 14:01.423
These are my associates.

14:01.465 --> 14:03.425
Where are your associates?

14:05.010 --> 14:07.096
I don't have any associates.

14:11.100 --> 14:13.310
- Okay.
- Okay.

14:13.352 --> 14:16.480
So, this is what
George agreed to.

14:16.522 --> 14:18.399
We can alternate days
at the dog park

14:18.440 --> 14:20.776
but he wants Shun Ju.

14:20.818 --> 14:24.238
- We eat there a lot.
- So do we.

14:24.280 --> 14:25.364
How about this?

14:25.406 --> 14:26.615
We'll take Shun Ju

14:26.657 --> 14:28.826
Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.327
You can have it every other day.

14:30.369 --> 14:32.371
- We need Mondays.
- Objection!

14:32.413 --> 14:34.915
Mondays are Moo Shu Mondays.

14:34.957 --> 14:37.251
She'd have to be an idiot
to agree to those terms.

14:37.293 --> 14:39.253
Calm it down, Schulman.

14:40.629 --> 14:43.132
We can alternate Mondays.

14:43.173 --> 14:44.675
However, if you breach
this agreement

14:44.717 --> 14:47.303
and trespass on a Monday
designated to us

14:47.344 --> 14:50.764
we are entitled to damages
including, but not limited to

14:50.806 --> 14:53.267
one Szechuan Sunday per month

14:53.309 --> 14:55.603
plus we reserve the right
to invoke cloture

14:55.644 --> 14:59.106
terminating your future Mondays
as designated herewith..

15:00.357 --> 15:02.443
...bitch.

15:02.484 --> 15:04.904
- Okay, so, we're agreed, then?
- 'No, Tessa.'

15:04.945 --> 15:08.324
Nothing is agreed to
until everything is agreed to.

15:11.201 --> 15:13.579
We haven't even started
with our demands yet.

15:16.040 --> 15:17.541
Sections three,
five and eleven are okay

15:17.583 --> 15:19.084
but I need Christmas
at the Farmer's Market

15:19.126 --> 15:20.169
'cause that's where
I buy my tree

15:20.210 --> 15:21.462
and I want full custody

15:21.503 --> 15:22.713
of the hardware store.

15:22.755 --> 15:25.049
And I want
next week's pub crawl.

15:25.090 --> 15:26.967
Well, fine,
I won't crawl the pubs

15:27.009 --> 15:29.219
if he promises
not to attend any pageants

15:29.261 --> 15:31.430
fashion shows
or fashion-show pageants.

15:31.472 --> 15:33.807
And I want Thanksgiving
at the Farmer's Market

15:33.849 --> 15:36.060
because that's where
I intend to buy my bird

15:36.101 --> 15:38.228
and all the fixings
for my acorn stuffing.

15:38.270 --> 15:40.814
Okay, she cannot purchase
every single acorn known to man.

15:40.856 --> 15:43.192
Some of us have dishes
that have acorns in them, too.

15:43.233 --> 15:44.860
I want a 36-acorn cap.

15:44.902 --> 15:47.655
Then I want all marathons,
walkathons, bikeathons

15:47.696 --> 15:50.199
and an-anything thon-related
that I might be forgetting.

15:50.240 --> 15:51.909
Pictionary at the Shays'.

15:51.951 --> 15:53.702
Furthermore, he must cease

15:53.744 --> 15:56.246
and desist tweeting about me!

15:56.288 --> 15:59.416
I've never tweeted about her.
I'm not even on Twitter.

15:59.458 --> 16:01.335
Actually, Noah set up
a parody account

16:01.377 --> 16:02.753
called @therealgeorgealtman.

16:02.795 --> 16:05.965
It's, it's blue
but...pretty entertaining stuff.

16:06.006 --> 16:07.591
Well, that's Noah's hobby,
not mine.

16:07.633 --> 16:09.635
No deal. Tell her no deal!

16:09.677 --> 16:11.720
For two people who didn't
want to be in contact

16:11.762 --> 16:15.015
they were doing an awful lot
of second-party communicating.

16:15.057 --> 16:17.393
And the second parties
were getting weary.

16:17.434 --> 16:18.978
So, mommy is running errands
tomorrow

16:19.019 --> 16:20.896
and she needs to park
on Weaver Street.

16:20.938 --> 16:25.109
Oh, George has Weaver Street,
and you know this.

16:25.150 --> 16:27.486
It took a lifetime
to bang out Weaver Street.

16:27.528 --> 16:29.321
I don't know what to tell you.

16:29.363 --> 16:31.240
These appointments
were scheduled months ago.

16:31.281 --> 16:34.159
of this?
- Totes.

16:34.201 --> 16:36.412
Who are they kidding? They don't
want to be in communication?

16:36.453 --> 16:39.331
constant
communication via us.

16:39.373 --> 16:41.125
I never wanted to
talk to you this much.

16:41.166 --> 16:42.501
Ditto.

16:42.543 --> 16:43.752
Maybe the two of them
running into each other

16:43.794 --> 16:45.879
would be for the best,
get it over with

16:45.921 --> 16:49.008
and then we can all
get back to our lives.

16:49.049 --> 16:52.136
Yeah. Even though
you don't have one.

16:59.309 --> 17:01.145
Victor, what are you doing?

17:01.186 --> 17:04.606
Packing up. Is it okay
if I keep this squirrel?

17:04.648 --> 17:06.692
Well, of course.
Sinclair is yours.

17:06.734 --> 17:08.736
I may have named him
but he belongs to you.

17:08.777 --> 17:12.031
Thanks. It's been fun
being your son.

17:12.072 --> 17:14.533
I'll drop you a line sometime.

17:14.575 --> 17:16.410
Where do you think you're going?

17:16.452 --> 17:17.870
Back to the orphanage.

17:17.911 --> 17:20.748
In my experience,
once the marriage fails

17:20.789 --> 17:24.334
the first thing to go
is the foster kids.

17:24.376 --> 17:26.045
The marriage didn't fail.

17:26.086 --> 17:28.380
But you don't love dad anymore.

17:28.422 --> 17:31.759
What? Why would you say that?

17:31.800 --> 17:34.553
It doesn't seem
like you love him.

17:34.595 --> 17:36.472
You don't take
your blazer off at night

17:36.513 --> 17:38.724
and you don't talk
about your day with him

17:38.766 --> 17:40.809
and he never gets
to touch your boobies.

17:40.851 --> 17:43.812
Victor! That's private talk.

17:45.105 --> 17:47.066
Fred, is that what you feel?

17:53.906 --> 17:55.949
We miss you, Sheila.

17:57.326 --> 18:00.245
I'm sorry. I am so sorry.

18:00.287 --> 18:02.206
I have just been under
so much pressure at work

18:02.247 --> 18:04.458
and it's lessened my libido.

18:04.500 --> 18:06.502
That happens, Victor.
That's a real thing.

18:06.543 --> 18:09.296
Then my wife
is never gonna work.

18:09.338 --> 18:11.757
It is a lot of responsibility
being the sole breadwinner.

18:11.799 --> 18:14.718
I know. I did it for years.

18:14.760 --> 18:17.179
But I learned to leave
my work at the office

18:17.221 --> 18:19.014
to make time for you.

18:21.016 --> 18:22.726
I don't want our marriage
to fail. I..

18:22.768 --> 18:26.396
It won't.
We won't let it.

18:26.438 --> 18:28.023
Look, I know
work's been hard on you

18:28.065 --> 18:30.025
and I just want you to know

18:30.067 --> 18:33.487
that our family appreciates it.

18:33.529 --> 18:36.031
And I just want you to know
that your pumpkin bread

18:36.073 --> 18:38.242
is moister than mine ever was.

18:38.283 --> 18:41.120
Really? Well,
the secret is Greek yogurt.

18:41.161 --> 18:43.831
Relationships take work,
whether you're husband and wife

18:43.872 --> 18:44.998
or BFFs.

18:45.040 --> 18:47.251
That's what I'm talking about.

18:47.292 --> 18:49.253
You have to know
when to hold on tight.

18:49.294 --> 18:50.754
- Hmm.
- Oh.

18:50.796 --> 18:52.047
- Take off my blazer.
- Will do.

18:52.089 --> 18:54.133
- Take off my blazer.
- Aye, aye.

18:54.174 --> 18:56.301
And when to let go.

19:00.639 --> 19:02.766
She's not supposed to be here.
It's a Tessa day.

19:02.808 --> 19:06.478
June! Over here.

19:06.520 --> 19:07.813
What are you doing?

19:07.855 --> 19:11.441
What I should have done
from the beginning..

19:11.483 --> 19:14.278
...being a good friend.

19:14.319 --> 19:15.445
I hope you know I never
would have let you

19:15.487 --> 19:18.365
celebrate your birthday
in a closet.

19:18.407 --> 19:20.951
I hope you know

19:27.249 --> 19:29.334
No, no. It's past that.
Keep going.

19:36.508 --> 19:38.510
I'm sorry. I think..

19:38.552 --> 19:41.096
Well, there must have been
some confusion.

19:43.515 --> 19:47.227
I think there definitely
was some confusion, yeah.

I've been okay.

19:54.318 --> 19:57.571
George, I just want to say,
I know you felt blind-sided

19:57.613 --> 19:59.156
and I, I wish
I could have handled--
