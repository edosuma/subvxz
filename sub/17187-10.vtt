We need to learn how they work.
How to fight them.

We're developing a human-interactive AI.

-Yeah.

someone I like spending time with...

Sweet.

-Right place?
-Right place.

02:29.233 --> 02:30.358
Should've brought John.

02:30.526 --> 02:34.237
Don't need to know much about
computers to know how to do this.

02:36.281 --> 02:37.740
Get the ones over there.

02:47.876 --> 02:50.086
It's the same as the rest.
It's vaporware.

02:50.254 --> 02:52.296
-There's nothing there?
-I didn't say that.

02:52.464 --> 02:54.090
It's a design for an AI.

02:54.258 --> 02:58.511
Built to handle big problems. But you need
a server farm to run it, and they've got zip.

02:58.679 --> 03:01.305
Less than zip, after you
lobotomized their desktops.

03:01.473 --> 03:02.765
But they have a design.

03:02.933 --> 03:06.686
It's like those articles about how terrorists
have the plans for nuclear bombs...

-...and all they're missing is the plutonium.

During the blackout, the AI reserved
generator power for itself...

...and in doing so, shut down
