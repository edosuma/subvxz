I'M KIND OF WORKING HERE.

00:08.550 --> 00:11.590
YOU KNOW, I AM
FAMILIAR WITH THE INTRICACIES

00:11.630 --> 00:14.140

-IS THIS REALLY
WHAT YOU DO ALL DAY?

00:15.470 --> 00:16.550
FOLLOW CHEATING HUSBANDS?

00:16.600 --> 00:17.930
SOMETIMES, YES.

00:17.970 --> 00:19.270
I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING
THIS GUY FOR MONTHS,

00:19.310 --> 00:20.980
I STILL DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING ON TAPE YET.

00:21.020 --> 00:24.400
AH, LET'S JUST HIT GEORGE

OH, HEY!
&lt;GRUNTS&gt;

00:38.410 --> 00:40.750
OOH! SWEET!

OH, HI! HOT GAL!

00:46.210 --> 00:49.250
HEY, UM, I'VE BEEN
THINKING ABOUT UPPING
THOSE STAKES IN BED.

00:49.300 --> 00:51.840

-&lt;LAUGHING&gt;

00:51.880 --> 00:53.130
UH... &lt;LAUGHING&gt;

00:54.340 --> 00:55.640

00:59.560 --> 01:03.100
UH, YEAH. I MIGHT
BE HERE FOR A WHILE.

01:03.140 --> 01:07.900
WELL, IF YOU GET OFF

01:07.940 --> 01:09.360
YEAH, LET'S JUST SEE
HOW THIS GOES.

01:09.400 --> 01:11.320
HEY, LOOK, HEY, CHECK ME
OUT, EH? FANCY, WHAT?

01:11.360 --> 01:13.190
GIVE IT TO ME OR DIE!
WHAT?

01:15.280 --> 01:16.490
SORRY, THAT WASN'T FOR YOU.

01:16.530 --> 01:20.450
ACTUALLY, I DO HAVE
SOMETHING FOR YOU,
TO BE HONEST, UH.

01:20.490 --> 01:23.710
I'D LIKE TO GIVE IT TO
YOU LATER, MAYBE
TONIGHT OR TOMORROW.

01:23.750 --> 01:26.500
OKAY. BYE.

01:27.290 --> 01:28.080
OKAY, TOUCH THIS AGAIN,

01:30.170 --> 01:31.300
AND FINGERS GET BROKE.

01:31.340 --> 01:32.880
ALL RIGHT!

01:32.920 --> 01:35.090
NO ONE BUYS A GIFT
LIKE THAT UNLESS THEY FELT
GUILTY ABOUT SOMETHING.

01:35.130 --> 01:36.340
EH, HEY, WHOA, WHOA, WAIT!

01:36.380 --> 01:38.930
IS THAT YOUR CHEATING
HUSBAND AT 11 O'CLOCK?

01:38.970 --> 01:42.310
ALL RIGHT, LADS.
LIKE I SAID, IT'S BEEN SWELL.
I'VE GOT WORK TO DO.

01:42.350 --> 01:43.810
DID HE JUST USE
A SPECIAL KNOCK?

01:43.850 --> 01:46.810
AH, SPECIAL KNOCK!
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT
MEANS? STRIPPERS!

01:46.850 --> 01:49.400
OKAY, YOU CAN EITHER STAY
HERE OR YOU CAN GO HOME,
BUT I GOTTA GO IN THERE.

01:49.440 --> 01:50.940
I JUST WANNA SEE
SOME BOOB, MAN!

01:50.980 --> 01:53.440
HEY, I SAW THAT SPECIAL KNOCK.

01:53.480 --> 01:54.990

FEELING ABOUT THIS!

02:04.410 --> 02:06.790
I THINK WE'RE GONNA
SEE SOME BOOB.

02:06.830 --> 02:10.460
WOW, IT'S A BUFFET
OF HIGH-POWERED
LAWYERS AND JUDGES.

02:10.500 --> 02:12.550
YEAH, A LITTLE SECRET
SOCIETY KIND OF THING.

02:16.670 --> 02:17.930
IS THIS SEAT TAKEN?

02:19.220 --> 02:21.220
MR. MAYOR.
JAKE.

02:21.260 --> 02:23.350
ALL THE STARS ARE OUT
TONIGHT, WHAT?

02:23.390 --> 02:24.640
JUST A BIT A FUN,
THAT'S ALL.

02:24.680 --> 02:26.310
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE
RUNNING A LITTLE LOW
ON HAPPINESS THERE.

02:28.480 --> 02:30.900
SO, WHAT'S THE BUY IN?

02:30.940 --> 02:34.360
[GUNMAN] NOBODY MOVE!
HANDS ON THE TABLE!
EMPTY YOUR POCKETS!

02:34.400 --> 02:37.400
WALLETS, WATCHES. NOW!

02:37.450 --> 02:39.110

02:45.580 --> 02:46.960
JAKE, DON'T BE AN IDIOT.

02:48.160 --> 02:49.210
[GUNMAN] PUT IT ALL

03:08.520 --> 03:10.060
[GUNMAN] SHUT UP!

03:22.320 --> 03:23.410
[GUNMAN] EVERYBODY
GETS THEIR TURN.

03:33.630 --> 03:34.920

IT'S JUST A NECKLACE. WHAT?

04:08.040 --> 04:09.080
OKAY, IT'S YOUR FAULT

04:09.120 --> 04:10.370
THAT I BROUGHT
THE FRIGGIN' NECKLACE

04:10.410 --> 04:11.460
IN THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE.

04:11.500 --> 04:13.370
&lt;CHUCKLES&gt;
MY FAULT?
GIVE ME A BREAK.

04:13.420 --> 04:14.920

WHAT'D IT COST YOU?

04:19.630 --> 04:21.260

[JAKE] WHAT'S ALL THIS?

04:22.430 --> 04:24.140
MY BACK. IT'S KILLING ME.

04:24.180 --> 04:25.470
I THREW IT OUT LAST NIGHT.

04:25.510 --> 04:26.720
OH. YOU NEED SOME PAINKILLERS?

04:26.760 --> 04:27.970
I KNOW A GUY,
IF YOU'RE LOOKIN'.

04:29.890 --> 04:31.770
&lt;CHUCKLES&gt;
COME ON, IT'S A JOKE!

04:31.810 --> 04:33.390
[MAL] WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM?
[CHRISTIAN] BROKEN HEART.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.440
SOMEONE STOLE THE NECKLACE
HE GOT FOR HIS GIRLFRIEND.

04:35.480 --> 04:37.360
SOMEONE, YEAH, BUT JUST...
I NEED YOUR HELP.

04:37.400 --> 04:38.780
I SUPPOSE I COULD, UH...

04:38.820 --> 04:41.780
NO, YOU DON'T,
MALACHY DOYLE. I TOLD
YOU, DOCTOR'S ORDERS.

04:41.820 --> 04:43.320
SORRY GUYS,
HE'S ALL MINE TODAY.

04:43.360 --> 04:45.530
IF YOU NEED BACKUP,
GET CHRISTIAN TO HELP YA.

04:45.570 --> 04:47.450
OH, HE'S BEEN ENOUGH HELP
ALREADY, HAVEN'T YA?

04:47.490 --> 04:48.830
I'M GOOD ON MY OWN, THANKS.

04:48.870 --> 04:50.040
NAH, I'LL HELP YOU, JAKE.

04:50.080 --> 04:51.450

04:58.040 --> 04:59.550
JUST STOP FOLLOWING ME AROUND!

04:59.590 --> 05:00.460
[CHRISTIAN] I'M NOT
FOLLOWING YOU!

05:05.430 --> 05:06.720
&lt;BOTH PANTING&gt;

05:06.760 --> 05:08.470
PRETENDING I HAVE
A BAD BACK IS GIVING
ME A BAD BACK.

05:08.510 --> 05:10.350
I DON'T FEEL TOTALLY
RIGHT ABOUT LYING.

05:10.390 --> 05:11.470
IT'S NOT MY STRONG SUIT.

05:11.520 --> 05:13.480
YOU OWE ME, OKAY?

05:13.520 --> 05:15.650
I'VE BEEN WAITING MONTHS FOR A
HONEYMOON THAT NEVER COMES.

05:15.690 --> 05:17.360
ONE DAY, THAT'S ALL I ASK.

05:17.400 --> 05:19.270
I KNOW. IT'S FINE.

05:19.320 --> 05:20.570
BESIDES, IT'LL GIVE
JAKE AND CHRISTIAN

05:20.610 --> 05:22.320
SOME QUALITY BONDING TIME.

05:22.360 --> 05:24.150
IF THEY DON'T KILL
EACH OTHER IN THE PROCESS.

05:26.410 --> 05:28.370
[CHRISTIAN] YOU BLAME ME
FOR LOSING THE BIG PRESENT?

05:28.410 --> 05:30.200
[CHRISTIAN] LET ME HELP YOU
GET IT BACK.
[JAKE] WHATEVER, CHRISTIAN.

05:30.240 --> 05:31.370
JUST SHUT UP, ALL RIGHT?

05:31.410 --> 05:33.200
WHAT PRESENT? YOU GOT
A PRESENT? IS IT FOR ME?

05:33.250 --> 05:34.580
ALL RIGHT, SO THIS JUDGE

05:34.620 --> 05:36.500
AND HALF THE LAWYERS IN TOWN
WERE AT THE POKER GAME.

05:36.540 --> 05:38.580
IT'S A WHO'S WHO
OF HIGH-POWERED DEGENERATES.

05:38.630 --> 05:40.630
THE MASKED GUNMAN, RIGHT?
HE SNAPS A BUNCH OF PICTURES,

05:40.670 --> 05:42.210
SO, IF YOU TRY TO TURN HIM IN,

05:42.260 --> 05:44.340
YOUR PICTURE ENDS UP IN THE
FRONT PAGE OF THE PAPER.

05:44.380 --> 05:45.470
[CHRISTIAN] PRETTY GOOD HEIST.

05:45.510 --> 05:48.010
OH, THE GIFT WAS
FOR ALLISON! I GET IT.
WHAT WAS IT?

05:48.050 --> 05:49.760
AN ENGAGEMENT RING?
YOU GETTING MARRIED?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

05:49.800 --> 05:52.220
IT WAS A NECKLACE,
AND WHY ARE YOU EVEN TALKING?

05:52.270 --> 05:54.430
I WASN'T. I WAS JUST...
&lt;STAMMERS&gt; THINKING...

05:54.480 --> 05:55.350
DID YOU GET YOUR HAIR CUT? NO?

05:58.060 --> 05:59.310
BIG QUESTION,

06:00.480 --> 06:01.520
WHY WAS THE MAYOR THERE?

06:01.570 --> 06:03.990
HMM. WHERE?

06:04.030 --> 06:06.530
-&lt;CELLPHONE RINGING&gt;
-LET'S FIND THIS GUNMAN.
LET'S DO THIS!

06:07.860 --> 06:08.950
KNOCK IT OFF.

06:08.990 --> 06:10.870
JAKE? HELLO?

06:10.910 --> 06:13.080
LET ME GUESS.
YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR SOME GAMBLING TIPS.

06:13.120 --> 06:15.410
&lt;LAUGHS&gt; NO, NO. UM,

06:15.450 --> 06:16.750
ACTUALLY I WAS HOPING I COULD,

06:16.790 --> 06:17.870
UH, HAVE A WORD.

06:17.920 --> 06:19.380
REALLY?

06:19.420 --> 06:20.460
MAL, HE PROBABLY
PINCHED A NERVE.

06:20.500 --> 06:24.010
OR EARLY SIGNS
OF SKELETAL DECAY.

06:24.050 --> 06:25.670
HE'S NOT AS LIMBER
AS HE USED TO BE.

06:25.720 --> 06:27.010
WHAT CAN I DO TO HELP YOU?

06:27.050 --> 06:29.430
AH, NO, NO, NO. NOT ON
THE PHONE. UM, CAN WE MEET?

06:29.470 --> 06:31.220
HOW LIMBER ARE YOU?
WHOA! HEY!

06:31.260 --> 06:33.350
I'M ACTUALLY KIND OF
BUSY AT THE MOMENT.

06:33.390 --> 06:34.470
COME ON, PLEASE, JAKE.

06:34.520 --> 06:36.600
THIS WILL ONLY TAKE
A MINUTE OF YOUR TIME.

06:36.640 --> 06:37.770
[DES] UNCLE! UNCLE! UNCLE!

06:38.600 --> 06:40.480
&lt;LAUGHING&gt;

06:40.520 --> 06:41.440
FINE. CAN YOU MEET ME NOW?

06:41.480 --> 06:43.360
UH, NOW? GREAT, YEAH,

06:43.400 --> 06:44.820
NOW IS PERFECT.

06:46.490 --> 06:47.650
STOP, STOP, STOP! JAKE!

06:48.570 --> 06:51.120
WHAT? WHERE WE GOING?

06:51.160 --> 06:54.660
&lt;STAMMERS&gt; HEY!
I'LL JUST HOLD DOWN THE...
THE OFFICE. THE FORT.

06:54.700 --> 06:56.500
DID YOU GUYS EAT?
I MADE SANDWICHES!

06:56.540 --> 06:59.250
OKAY, I'LL JU... HMM...

07:07.720 --> 07:09.010
I THOUGHT WE'D BE ALONE.

07:09.050 --> 07:10.260
DON'T MIND ME.

07:10.300 --> 07:12.300
YEAH, HE'S JUST
MY BROTHER. NO HARM.

07:12.350 --> 07:13.930
RIGHT. WELL, UH,

07:13.970 --> 07:18.230
THAT'S GREAT. THANKS.
THANKS FOR COMING.
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

07:18.270 --> 07:21.520
I'M SURE YOU UNDERSTAND
MY, UM, CONCERN ABOUT
THE EVENTS OF LAST NIGHT.

07:21.560 --> 07:25.440
&lt;CLICKS TONGUE&gt; YEAH.
YOU INDULGE IN ONE
LITTLE VICE, WHAT?

07:25.480 --> 07:26.900
NEXT THING YOU KNOW YOU GOT
A HOOKER IN YOUR LAP,

07:26.940 --> 07:30.070
AND THREE GRAMS
OF COKE ON YOUR PLATE.
IT'S A CLASSIC TALE.

07:30.110 --> 07:32.030
THOSE PHOTOS?
THEY CAN'T GET OUT.

07:32.070 --> 07:34.120
I MEAN, I CAN'T EVEN
THINK ABOUT WHAT
THAT WOULD DO TO LESLIE.

07:34.160 --> 07:35.370
LESLIE?

07:35.410 --> 07:36.620
YEAH.

07:36.660 --> 07:38.500
AND THE FACT THAT YOU'RE
FACING AN ELECTION CAMPAIGN

07:38.540 --> 07:39.580
HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH IT, RIGHT?

07:41.500 --> 07:44.920
YEAH, YEAH, OF COURSE
IT DOES, BUT EITHER WAY I NEED
TO GET THAT CAMERA, AND, UM...

07:46.500 --> 07:47.550
I WANNA PAY YOU TO FIND IT.

07:49.340 --> 07:50.590
YOU WANNA HIRE ME?
YEAH.

07:51.880 --> 07:53.680
WHATEVER, FINE.

07:53.720 --> 07:56.140
WELL, THAT'S GREAT,
THAT'S GREAT. AND OBVIOUSLY
I DON'T NEED TO REMIND YOU

07:56.180 --> 07:58.770
THAT THIS CONVERSATION
NEVER HAPPENED?

07:58.810 --> 07:59.890
OBVIOUSLY.

07:59.930 --> 08:01.560
OR THE POKER GAME, EITHER.

08:01.600 --> 08:02.600
&lt;CLICKS TONGUE&gt;

08:05.650 --> 08:06.730
[JAKE] THAT'S A NICE RIDE
FOR A MAYOR.

08:06.770 --> 08:11.610
YEAH. THAT ONE HAS
THE WANT IN HIS EYES.
IN THE WORST WAY.

08:13.360 --> 08:15.530
BUT ISN'T IT A LITTLE
EARLY FOR THIS?

08:15.570 --> 08:17.870
HONEYMOON. PICTURE YOURSELF
ON A BEACH SOMEWHERE.

08:17.910 --> 08:20.160
SHOULDN'T YOU BE
WEARING YOUR BIKINI?

08:21.250 --> 08:22.290
&lt;GLASSES CLINK&gt;

08:22.330 --> 08:24.500
LET'S JUST SEE WHERE
NUMBER THREE TAKES US.

08:24.540 --> 08:26.290
-MAYBE I SHOULD CHECK
IN WITH THE BOYS.
-&lt;GRUNTS&gt;

08:26.340 --> 08:27.710
MAKE SURE THEY'RE
BOTH STILL ALIVE.

08:27.750 --> 08:29.960
NO, YOU DON'T! ONE WHOLE
DAY OFF, START TO FINISH!

08:30.010 --> 08:31.970
WE NEED TO START
TAKING MORE BREAKS.

08:32.010 --> 08:33.590
&lt;DOOR OPENING&gt;
[TINNY] HELLO?

08:36.890 --> 08:38.140
HEY.

08:38.810 --> 08:40.390
OH, ME BACK!

08:41.640 --> 08:43.060
POPPY, WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YA?

08:43.100 --> 08:45.230
OH, HE'S FINE, HE
JUST... HIS BACK IS OUT.

08:45.270 --> 08:46.400
HOW ARE YOU, HONEY?

08:46.440 --> 08:47.480
I'M FINE.

08:49.610 --> 08:51.740
IS THAT A TEQUILA BOTTLE
IN THE BLENDER?

08:51.780 --> 08:54.660
TINNY, HONEY, WHY DON'T
YOU GO TO THE OFFICE
AND HELP THE BOYS?

08:54.700 --> 08:56.700
I HAVE TO STAY HERE
WITH HIM, OBVIOUSLY.

08:56.740 --> 08:58.700
-SURE. DO I GET PAID?
-YEAH, I'LL TAKE IT
OFF YOUR RENT.

08:58.740 --> 09:00.580
&lt;CHUCKLES&gt;

09:00.620 --> 09:03.120
SEE YOU LATER, POPPY.
I HOPE YOU FEEL BETTER.

09:03.160 --> 09:04.330
THANKS, SWEETHEART.

09:04.370 --> 09:05.420
&lt;DOOR OPENS&gt;

09:06.000 --> 09:07.750
&lt;DORR CLOSES&gt;

09:07.790 --> 09:09.590
YOU HAVE ME LYING
TO MY GRANDDAUGHTER NOW!

09:09.630 --> 09:13.340
SHE'LL LIVE! ANYONE FOR
MICROWAVABLE COCONUT SHRIMP?

09:13.380 --> 09:14.680
NOW WE'RE TALKING.
&lt;GLASSES CLINK&gt;

09:14.720 --> 09:15.800
&lt;ROSE GIGGLES&gt;

09:15.840 --> 09:17.140
SO WHAT, LANCE,
YOU WERE WORKING

09:17.180 --> 09:18.760
IN FRONT
OF THE RESTAURANT
ALL LAST NIGHT, RIGHT?

09:18.800 --> 09:21.180
YEAH, YOU CALL IT WORKING.
STOOD AROUND FOR HOURS
BATTING MY EYELASHES,

09:21.220 --> 09:22.640
AND I NEVER GOT A SINGLE BITE.

09:22.680 --> 09:24.560
YEAH, BUDDY. DON'T WORRY.
IT'S, UH, THEM, NOT YOU, OKAY?

09:26.190 --> 09:27.520
SO, TELL ME,
DID YOU SEE ANYTHING?

09:27.560 --> 09:29.400
YEAH, I SAW THREE WORKING
GIRLS WAITING IN THE ALLEYWAY.

09:29.440 --> 09:31.030
REALLY? WHAT'D THEY LOOK LIKE?

09:31.070 --> 09:33.780
OH, THEY WERE DRESSED
SKIMPILY AS ALL HELL.

09:33.820 --> 09:35.700
THEY WERE WITH THIS LITTLE,
UH, LITTLE SQUIRRELY FELLA.

09:35.740 --> 09:39.160
-SEE WHERE THEY WENT?
-YEAH. BUDDY TOOK OFF
ON FOOT, AND THEN, UM...

09:39.200 --> 09:41.080
AND THEN THE GIRLS HOPPED
IN A CAB AND DROVE AWAY.

09:41.120 --> 09:44.580
IF YOU SEE ANYTHING ELSE,
ANYTHING AT ALL, GIVE ME
A CALL, ALL RIGHT?

09:44.620 --> 09:46.170
SEE YA. THANKS.

09:46.210 --> 09:48.080
THERE WAS ONE OTHER
WEIRD THING, THOUGH.

09:48.130 --> 09:49.380
THERE WERE SUITS.

09:49.420 --> 09:50.960
YEAH, THERE WAS TWO SUITS
SITTING IN A VAN.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.090
WELL, WHAT WERE THEY DOING?

09:52.130 --> 09:53.170
[LANCE] JUST WATCHING.

09:53.210 --> 09:55.010
WATCHING WHO? THE GIRLS?

09:55.050 --> 09:56.680
I DON'T KNOW.
SEEMED LIKE NARCS TO ME.

09:56.720 --> 09:58.140
ALL RIGHT, LANCE. THANKS!

09:58.180 --> 10:02.260
WHAT THE HELL ARE WE
EVEN LOOKING FOR HERE?
THIS IS DISGUSTING.

10:02.310 --> 10:03.970
WE'RE LOOKING
FOR EVIDENCE, MY BROTHER.

10:04.020 --> 10:06.520
REALLY? IN THE GARBAGE
BEHIND THE RESTAURANT
THAT HE JUST ROBBED?

10:06.560 --> 10:08.230
YOU THINK HE JUST
DUMPED THE GUN HERE?

10:08.270 --> 10:11.110
JUST IMAGINE THAT YOU'RE
A PANICKED MORON, OKAY?
AND YOU JUST MADE IT RICH.

10:11.150 --> 10:13.570
NOW, THE PANICKED MORON
THING SHOULD BE EASY
FOR YOU TO IDENTIFY WITH.

10:13.610 --> 10:15.610
HEY, HEY! I'M TRAINED
AS A LAWYER, OKAY?
I UNDERSTAND CRIMINAL...

10:17.780 --> 10:18.990
&lt;LAUGHS&gt;

10:22.910 --> 10:24.660
LOOK! NOW, WHAT'D I TELL YA?

10:25.410 --> 10:26.830
LOOK FAMILIAR?

10:26.870 --> 10:28.830
THESE COULD BE THE COVERALLS
THAT OUR GUNMAN WAS
WEARING LAST NIGHT.

10:28.870 --> 10:32.130
CHECK THE MANUFACTURER'S
LABEL ON THAT, AND CROSS
REFERENCE IT WITH ANY STORE

10:32.170 --> 10:34.880
IN ST. JOHN'S THAT MIGHT
CARRY THAT KIND OF COVERALL.

10:34.920 --> 10:38.380
WE MIGHT GET LUCKY.
MAYBE THE GUY WAS STUPID
ENOUGH TO USE A CREDIT CARD

10:38.430 --> 10:40.760
OR HIS DEBIT OR SOMETHING.

10:40.800 --> 10:41.720
ISN'T THAT THE JUDGE
FROM LAST NIGHT?

10:42.680 --> 10:43.890
&lt;TIRES SCREECHING&gt;

10:43.930 --> 10:46.850
HMM. GUESS THE MAYOR'S
NOT THE ONLY ONE WORRIED
ABOUT THOSE PHOTOS.

10:46.890 --> 10:49.810
MAYBE HE CAME BACK HERE
TO COVER HIS TRACKS,
BUT WE BEAT HIM TO IT.

10:50.860 --> 10:52.860
SEE YOU LATER.
WHERE'RE YOU GOING?

10:52.900 --> 10:56.990
JUST... CHECK OUT
THE COVERALLS, AND LOOK
INTO THE JUDGE.

10:57.030 --> 10:59.570
EARN YOUR KEEP
OR YOU'LL BE FIRED.
&lt;CLICKS TONGUE&gt;

11:06.910 --> 11:08.290
DES, WHAT'S WITH YOU?

11:08.330 --> 11:10.000
I'M TRYING TO GET THIS BORING
CRAP DONE OVER HERE.

11:10.040 --> 11:11.380
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE THAT
I GET A PROMOTION,

11:11.420 --> 11:12.880
AND I'M STUCK SITTING
ON THE BENCH.

11:12.920 --> 11:14.590
MEANWHILE, THE NEW GUY
GETS TO RIDE SHOTGUN
RIGHT OUTTA THE GATE.

11:14.630 --> 11:16.460
WELL, WHAT DOES UNCLE
JAKE ALWAYS TELL YA?

11:16.510 --> 11:18.300
TO GET AWAY FROM HIM?

11:18.340 --> 11:19.430
THE OTHER THING.

11:19.470 --> 11:21.220
I HAVE UNUSUALLY LONG ARMS?

11:21.260 --> 11:22.720
&lt;CHUCKLES&gt;
NO! TAKE INITIATIVE.

11:24.430 --> 11:25.510
GET OUT THERE ON YOUR OWN.

11:25.560 --> 11:27.140
NO, NO, NO. HE USUALLY
YELLS AT ME FOR THAT.

11:27.180 --> 11:29.230
HE WOULDN'T YELL AT
YOU IF YOU ACTUALLY FOUND
SOMETHING WORTH FINDING.

11:29.270 --> 11:31.730
OKAY, WHAT ABOUT
THIS JEAN FRANCIS WOMAN?

11:32.480 --> 11:33.810
I DON'T KNOW.

11:33.860 --> 11:35.230
SHE HAS A FOUNDATION DOWNTOWN.

11:35.270 --> 11:37.490
GO SEE HER,
DO A LITTLE DIGGING.

11:37.530 --> 11:39.030
SHOW SOME INDEPENDENCE, DES!

11:40.150 --> 11:41.990
YEAH! INDEPENDENCE!

11:43.780 --> 11:45.280

11:46.490 --> 11:47.750

11:48.160 --> 11:49.910
GOOD, GOOD.

11:52.750 --> 11:54.590
&lt;DOOR CLOSES&gt;

11:54.630 --> 11:56.050
YEAH, I HAD A LONG NIGHT.

11:56.090 --> 11:58.420
DO YOU MIND IF I, UH,
JUST GO TAKE A SHOWER?

11:58.460 --> 12:01.840
I'D OFFER YOU SOME
COFFEE, BUT I DON'T
HAVE ANY CREAM.

12:01.880 --> 12:03.930
I AM SO SICK OF LIVING
IN A HOTEL ROOM. I JUST...

12:03.970 --> 12:05.850
I WISH THAT ONE OF US
HAD A BIGGER PLACE.

12:05.890 --> 12:07.770
-YEAH!
-[ALLISON] YOU KNOW,
SOMEWHERE WHERE WE'D HAVE,

12:07.810 --> 12:09.850
I DON'T KNOW, LIKE, A KITCHEN?

12:11.100 --> 12:12.310
"WE?"

12:12.350 --> 12:13.940
I'M NOT PRESSURING YOU.

12:16.980 --> 12:19.440
RIGHT.

12:19.490 --> 12:23.990
I'M JUST POINTING OUT
THAT I LIVE IN A HOTEL ROOM,
AND YOU LIVE IN AN OFFICE.

12:24.030 --> 12:27.370
WELL, I LIKE IT HERE
PERSONALLY. I MEAN,
IT'S GOT CLEANERS, YOU KNOW?

12:27.410 --> 12:29.160
IT'S GOT ROOM SERVICE.
IT'S REALLY QUITE LUXURIOUS...

12:29.200 --> 12:31.040
-[ALLISON] JAKE.
-[JAKE] OKAY, WHAT'RE
YOU GETTING AT HERE?

12:31.080 --> 12:32.960
I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO MOVE IN
WITH ME OR ANYTHING.

12:33.870 --> 12:35.540
OR ANYTHING.

12:35.580 --> 12:38.880
I'M JUST POINTING OUT THAT
I'M SICK OF LIVING OUT
OF A SUITCASE. THAT'S ALL.

12:40.800 --> 12:43.630
BUT HEY! I GOT YOU SOMETHING.

12:43.680 --> 12:48.010
-OKAY.
-I MEAN I HAD, I MEAN
I HAVE! I HAVE IT, IN A WAY,

12:48.060 --> 12:49.310
BUT, UH...

12:49.350 --> 12:51.140
WELL, WHAT IS IT?
IT'S A PRESENT,

12:52.810 --> 12:56.940
AND I AM GOING TO GIVE IT
TO YOU AT A LATER DATE.

12:58.480 --> 13:00.610
WELL, FOR FUTURE REFERENCE,

13:00.650 --> 13:05.610

GET UP ANYWAY.

13:27.300 --> 13:28.850
NO, NO, NO. YOU WERE
WORKING ALL NIGHT.

13:28.890 --> 13:30.600
I'LL GET OUT OF YOUR HAIR.

13:30.640 --> 13:32.390
LEFT MY DATEBOOK
BEHIND, YESTERDAY.

13:32.430 --> 13:34.640
YES, I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA
COME BACK HERE LAST NIGHT.

13:35.730 --> 13:38.020
WELL, I WENT OUT
WITH THE LADS, REMEMBER?

13:38.060 --> 13:40.020
-COME ON, I TOLD

13:40.070 --> 13:42.230
-YEAH.
-YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD
GET A BETTER ICE TIME.

13:42.280 --> 13:43.860
YOU ARE THE MAYOR, YOU KNOW.

13:43.900 --> 13:46.950
ALL RIGHT, I DID GO OUT
FOR A FEW AFTER, BUT I ENDED
UP CRASHING AT MY PLACE.

13:48.740 --> 13:51.410
-LOOK, I'LL, UH, COME AFTER
WORK IF IT'S NOT TOO LATE.
-OKAY.

13:52.910 --> 13:53.830
SLEEP.

13:57.920 --> 13:59.340
HOW'S THAT NEW CORVETTE?

14:00.380 --> 14:02.210
MUST'VE COST A FORTUNE.

14:02.250 --> 14:03.880
WHAT, THAT? I... I LEASED IT.

14:03.920 --> 14:05.550
OH.

14:05.590 --> 14:07.090
WHAT, D'YA THINK I BOUGHT IT?

14:07.130 --> 14:08.680
&lt;CHUCKLES&gt;
IT'S, UM, OPTICS, YOU KNOW?

14:08.720 --> 14:11.560

14:33.830 --> 14:36.290
AND I CALLED EVERY STORE
PRETENDING TO BE A BANK.

14:36.330 --> 14:37.790
JUST PUT THESE ON.

14:37.830 --> 14:40.790

14:47.930 --> 14:48.970
PETTY THEFT, MOSTLY.

14:49.010 --> 14:50.180
WELL, LOOK AROUND.

14:50.220 --> 14:51.600
CHECK THE DRAWERS,
CHECK THE CLOSETS,

14:51.640 --> 14:54.010

WELL, LOOK AT THIS.

15:37.020 --> 15:39.230

YEAH.

15:39.270 --> 15:41.060
HEY, MAYBE HE PUT
THE GOOD STUFF SOMEWHERE ELSE?

15:41.100 --> 15:43.020

STUFF UNDER THE MATTRESS.

15:43.860 --> 15:45.110
[JAKE] YEAH, MAYBE.

15:50.860 --> 15:51.910

17:23.330 --> 17:28.170

17:28.210 --> 17:30.090

17:30.130 --> 17:33.130
WELL, &lt;EXHALES&gt; THANKS

OH. KEEP IT, I'VE GOT MORE.
I'M A GREAT SUPPORTER
OF THE MAYOR.

17:42.980 --> 17:44.560
HE'S EXACTLY WHAT
THIS CITY NEEDS.

17:44.600 --> 17:46.100
GOOD LUCK.

17:48.360 --> 17:50.070
&lt;POLICE SIRENS WAILING&gt;

17:50.110 --> 17:52.480
TWO SHOTS TO THE STERNUM

A SMALL CALIBER PISTOL.

17:54.030 --> 17:55.950
DON'T SUPPOSE YOU WANNA TELL
ME WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE?

17:55.990 --> 17:59.070
UH, WE'RE JUST TRYING

18:06.160 --> 18:07.790
IT'S A VERY NICE LIKENESS.

18:07.830 --> 18:11.380
IT'S NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.
WE WERE AT A PARTY, UH,
SORT OF. WE WERE WORKING.

18:11.420 --> 18:13.340
OH, YEAH. IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU WORKING REALLY HARD.

18:13.380 --> 18:14.380
THOSE AREN'T OUR HOOKERS.

18:16.470 --> 18:18.970
YOU'RE NOT HELPING.
JUST LET ME EXPLAIN.

18:19.010 --> 18:23.220
THE ONLY THING I NEED FROM
YOU IS A STATEMENT DOWN
AT THE STATION, IF NECESSARY.

18:23.270 --> 18:24.930
SURE.

18:24.980 --> 18:26.640
ABSOLUTELY. UH, CAN'T WAIT.

18:32.230 --> 18:33.280
"CAN'T WAIT"?

18:39.200 --> 18:41.280
IT WAS A NICE IDEA,
TAKING SHOTS
OF THOSE LAP DANCE PHOTOS

18:41.330 --> 18:43.120
BEFORE THE COPS SHOWED UP.

18:43.160 --> 18:45.410
YEAH, WELL, PRINT THEM
OFF FOR ME, WILL YA?
I GOTTA MAKE A PHONE CALL.

18:45.450 --> 18:47.290
I WONDER WHAT
LESLIE WOULD LOOK
LIKE DRESSED LIKE THIS.

18:48.420 --> 18:50.250
EXCUSE ME?
IT'S A JOKE, JAKE.

18:51.210 --> 18:53.340
JUST... WATCH YOURSELF.

18:54.300 --> 18:56.010
THIS ONE HAS AN OAKY FLAVOR.

18:56.050 --> 19:00.340
SEE, ALL WE HAVE TO DO
HERE IS REMOVE THREE
WALLS FROM UPSTAIRS,

19:00.390 --> 19:03.180
EXTEND THE BATHROOM
FOR THE JACUZZI, AND WE'RE
OFF TO THE RACES!

19:03.220 --> 19:06.270
YEAH, BUT I DON'T THINK
THE KIDS'RE GONNA APPRECIATE
LOSING THEIR ROOMS.

19:06.310 --> 19:10.440
I THOUGHT OF THAT. WE GIVE
CHRISTIAN THE BOOT, MOVE
TINNY INTO THE SMALL ROOM,

19:10.480 --> 19:13.480
DES TO THE OLD OFFICE,
CHANGE THE LOCKS,
AND WE'RE GOOD TO GO!

19:13.520 --> 19:14.820
DES IN THE GARAGE?

19:14.860 --> 19:16.030
WE'LL GET HIM A SPACE HEATER.

19:16.070 --> 19:17.280
OOH.
&lt;CELLPHONE RINGING&gt;

19:17.320 --> 19:18.530
&lt;GRUNTING&gt;

19:19.450 --> 19:20.490
&lt;INHALES DEEPLY&gt;

19:20.530 --> 19:23.280
YOU'RE NOT PLANNING TO EVER
MOVE BACK IN HERE, ARE YOU?

19:23.330 --> 19:25.160
WHAT? GOD, NO.

19:25.870 --> 19:27.000
GOOD.

19:27.040 --> 19:28.370
ARE YOU EVER COMING BACK
TO WORK OR WHAT?

19:28.410 --> 19:29.710
GET ALONG WITH YOUR BROTHER!

19:29.750 --> 19:31.670
WHAT, I... WE ARE GETTING
ALONG! ANSWER MY QUESTION.

19:31.710 --> 19:32.920
ARE YOU COMING BACK
TO WORK OR NOT?

19:32.960 --> 19:36.000
LOOK! USE THIS TIME
TOGETHER. IT'S PRECIOUS.

19:36.050 --> 19:37.300
ARE YOU DRUNK?

19:37.340 --> 19:41.800
-WHAT?
-NO! IT'S THE DRUGS, JAKE.
AND HE NEEDS HIS REST.

19:41.840 --> 19:43.100
[ROSE] DOCTOR'S ORDERS.

19:44.720 --> 19:46.310
WHAT'RE YOU DOING?

19:46.350 --> 19:49.810
LET'S TRY THE 21-YEAR-OLD
SINGLE MALT,
AND GO OVER PLAN B.

19:51.480 --> 19:53.610
DES AND TINNY
MOVE IN WITH JAKE.

19:53.650 --> 19:56.110
NICE. &lt;CHUCKLES&gt;

20:00.070 --> 20:02.950
WHAT'S THIS? NO, YOU TOOK
THE ACTUAL PHOTO OF THE MAYOR?

20:02.990 --> 20:05.080
JAKE, IT'S EVIDENCE
IN A MURDER CASE.

20:05.120 --> 20:06.990
YEAH, WELL, I DIDN'T
WANT LESLIE TO SEE IT.

20:07.040 --> 20:08.410
OKAY, I'M NOT SURE WHAT
YOU'RE THINKING HERE, BUT

20:08.450 --> 20:10.660
MY GUT TELLS ME THAT THIS
IS NOT ONLY ABOUT LESLIE.

20:10.710 --> 20:12.250
WELL, TELL YOUR GUT
TO SHUT ITS MOUTH.

20:12.290 --> 20:14.040
HEY, IT'S A LITTLE
OBVIOUS THAT YOU'RE,
YOU KNOW,

20:14.080 --> 20:15.420
YOU'RE JEALOUS OF THE MAYOR.

20:15.460 --> 20:18.300
IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE.
HE'S GOOD-LOOKING. POWERFUL.

20:18.340 --> 20:19.380
CHRISTIAN, PLEASE STOP
PESTERING ME.

20:19.420 --> 20:21.260
I'M YOUR OLDER BROTHER.
IT'S MY RIGHT.

20:21.300 --> 20:24.300
OKAY, FOCUS ON FINDING
MY REAL GIRLFRIEND'S NECKLACE.

20:24.340 --> 20:25.260
&lt;CELLPHONE RINGING&gt;

20:25.300 --> 20:26.890
&lt;SIGHS&gt;

20:26.930 --> 20:28.470
-[JAKE ON PHONE] WHAT DO YOU WANT?
-UH, OKAY.

20:28.520 --> 20:31.560
DON'T GET MAD. I WENT
TO SEE JEAN FRANCIS
AND I'M STILL THERE NOW.

20:31.600 --> 20:34.310
JEAN FRAN... WHO TOLD YOU
TO GO SEE ANYBODY?

20:34.350 --> 20:37.360
UH, I CAN'T REVEAL MY SOURCES?

20:38.900 --> 20:40.280
DES ACTUALLY GOT A LOT
OUT OF THE LADY.

20:40.320 --> 20:42.280
HE FOUND OUT SHE'S
A COMPULSIVE GAMBLER,

20:42.320 --> 20:44.030
AND HE GOT A PHOTO
OF HER WITH THE MAYOR.

20:44.070 --> 20:46.490
REALLY? WELL, MAYBE THERE'S
MORE OF A CONNECTION
THERE THAN WE THOUGHT.

20:46.530 --> 20:47.530
[TINNY] SHE SAID SHE'S
A BIG SUPPORTER.

20:49.750 --> 20:51.410
[DES] OKAY, SO WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO DO NOW?

20:51.460 --> 20:52.460
PUT TINNY BACK ON THE PHONE.

20:54.710 --> 20:56.960
LOOK INTO JEAN FRANCIS,
OKAY? AND THE FOUNDATION.

20:57.000 --> 21:00.340
SEE IF YOU CAN FIND ANY REASON
AT ALL WHY SHE'D WANNA
HOLD UP A POKER GAME.

21:00.380 --> 21:02.920
OKAY.

21:02.970 --> 21:06.350
HEY, LISTEN. UM, WITH REGARDS
TO CHRISTIAN WORKING WITH YOU,
I JUST GOTTA SAY,

21:06.390 --> 21:07.890
I THINK SENIORITY SHOULD
COME INTO PLAY HERE, MAN.

21:07.930 --> 21:10.310
I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT
A UNION COMING IN HERE
AND EVERYTHING, BUT...

21:10.350 --> 21:11.890
HELLO?

21:11.930 --> 21:13.890
HELLO, JAKE?

21:13.940 --> 21:17.020
SO, EVERYONE'S GOT
A PHOTO EXCEPT FOR THE JUDGE.

21:17.060 --> 21:18.440
WHERE'S HIS?

21:18.480 --> 21:19.820
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE THE
GUNMAN LOST IT?

21:19.860 --> 21:22.440
OR MAYBE THE JUDGE
IS THE ONE THAT HIRED
THE GUNMAN IN THE FIRST PLACE,

21:22.490 --> 21:23.860
AND HE GOT HIS PICTURE BACK.

21:23.900 --> 21:25.990
HE SHOWED UP WHEN WE
WERE GETTING THOSE
COVERALLS OUTTA THE GARBAGE.

21:26.030 --> 21:28.330
MAYBE HE WAS THERE
TO GET THEM HIMSELF?
TRYING TO COVER HIS TRACKS?

21:28.370 --> 21:30.450
BUT WHY WOULD THAT GUY
HOLD UP A POKER GAME?

21:30.490 --> 21:33.580
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE HE NEEDED
THE MONEY. YOU KNOW, PAY OFF
DEBTS, GAMBLING DEBTS MAYBE?

21:33.620 --> 21:35.580
&lt;CELLPHONE RINGING&gt;
[CHRISTIAN] YOU'RE GONNA GET

21:35.620 --> 21:37.460
BRAIN CANCER TALKING ON THAT
THING ALL THE TIME.

21:37.670 --> 21:38.880
HI.

21:38.920 --> 21:42.510
I HEARD ABOUT THE GUNMAN.
DID YOU FIND MY PHOTO?

21:42.550 --> 21:46.390
UH... NO. NOT YET, BUT

21:46.430 --> 21:48.510
UH, I'M LOOKING INTO IT.
DON'T WORRY.

21:48.550 --> 21:50.260
GREAT, GREAT. I APPRECIATE IT.

21:51.640 --> 21:53.520
DID YOU SAY ANYTHING
TO LESLIE ABOUT ALL THIS?

21:53.560 --> 21:56.560
BECAUSE SHE WAS ASKING
QUESTIONS THIS MORNING ABOUT
WHAT I WAS DOING LAST NIGHT.

21:56.600 --> 21:58.730
YEAH, WELL, HERE'S AN IDEA.
WHY DON'T YOU TELL HER?

21:58.770 --> 22:01.730
YEAH, YEAH, I THINK
THAT SHIP HAS SAILED.

22:01.780 --> 22:04.400
LOOK, I HOPE I CAN
CONTINUE TO RELY
ON YOUR DISCRETION ON THIS.

22:04.440 --> 22:06.240
&lt;SIGHS&gt; YEAH, WELL,
I'LL KEEP YOU POSTED

22:06.280 --> 22:07.450
IF I FIND ANYTHING NEW.

22:07.490 --> 22:08.620
ALL RIGHT.

22:10.580 --> 22:11.450
WHAT?

22:11.490 --> 22:13.540
I DON'T KNOW. I JUST...

22:13.580 --> 22:15.750
I'M GETTING THIS FEELING
LIKE I'M BEING PLAYED
OR SOMETHING.

22:17.420 --> 22:19.250
LET'S GO TRACK DOWN
THAT JUDGE.

22:21.550 --> 22:22.550
&lt;DOOR OPENS&gt;

22:41.020 --> 22:42.400
CAN'T BELIEVE
THE JUDGE AGREED TO SEE US.

22:42.440 --> 22:43.780
HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW
WHO WE ARE.

22:43.820 --> 22:46.150
WELL, MAYBE HE'S EXPECTING
SOMEONE. OR SOMETHING.

22:46.190 --> 22:47.200
YOU NEVER KNOW, RIGHT?

22:48.490 --> 22:49.570
&lt;CLEARS THROAT&gt;

22:49.610 --> 22:50.530
WHAT DO YOU TWO WANT?

22:50.570 --> 22:51.620
HEY THERE, JUDGE NELSON.

22:52.660 --> 22:55.200
I BELIEVE WE MET
AT THE POKER GAME LAST NIGHT,

22:55.250 --> 22:56.370
AND WE SPOTTED
EACH OTHER EARLIER TODAY.

22:56.410 --> 22:57.750
I KNOW WHO YOU ARE. I

22:57.790 --> 23:01.460
GOT THE PHONE MESSAGES.
THE ANSWER IS STILL NO.

23:01.500 --> 23:03.920
-WHAT PHONE MESSAGES?
-WE NEVER LEFT ANY PHONE
MESSAGES, YOUR HONOR.

23:03.960 --> 23:05.130
YEAH, RIGHT!

23:05.170 --> 23:07.630
YOU SHOW UP AT THE GAME,
IT'S SUDDENLY HELD UP.

23:07.670 --> 23:09.840
I SAW YOU FISHING
YOUR BUDDY'S COVERALLS
OUT OF THE TRASH.

23:09.890 --> 23:11.640
NO, NO, NO.
LOOK, YOU'RE ALL MIXED UP
HERE, OKAY?

23:11.680 --> 23:13.970
WE'RE NOT WORKING WITH THE GUY
WHO RIPPED OFF THE POKER GAME

23:14.010 --> 23:15.520
IN FACT, WE FOUND HIM DEAD
EARLIER TODAY.

23:15.560 --> 23:18.810
WHAT?
IS THAT SUPPOSED
TO BE SOME KIND OF THREAT?

23:18.850 --> 23:20.480
NO! JUDGE NELSON, WE--
NOW, YOU LISTEN TO ME!

23:20.520 --> 23:22.480
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU DO
WITH THAT PHOTO

23:22.520 --> 23:24.270
I AM NOT CAVING TO BLACKMAIL.

23:24.320 --> 23:26.990
AND YOU CAN SEND THAT MESSAGE
BACK TO THE COWARD
THAT SENT YOU.

23:27.030 --> 23:29.950
WHOA, BLACKMAIL? LISTEN,
PALLY, YOU GOT US MIXED UP
WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

23:29.990 --> 23:32.820
CALL IT WHATEVER YOU WANT.
THE ANSWER IS STILL NO.

23:32.870 --> 23:36.200
NOW, GET THE HELL OUT
OR I'LL HAVE YOU THROWN OUT.

23:37.330 --> 23:38.410
I THINK WE SHOULD DO
WHAT THE MAN SAYS.

23:41.370 --> 23:42.580
NICE WORK.

23:42.630 --> 23:44.460
NOW THE JUDGE THINKS
WE'RE BLACKMAILING HIM.

23:44.500 --> 23:45.500
WELL, SOMEONE'S
BLACKMAILING HIM,

23:45.550 --> 23:48.130
AND WHOEVER IT IS, KNOWS
WHERE TO FIND MY NECKLACE.

23:48.170 --> 23:49.670
I'M SORRY, BROTHER.
THIS ISN'T ABOUT A NECKLACE.

23:49.720 --> 23:51.760
THIS IS ABOUT A PISSING MATCH
BETWEEN YOU AND THE MAYOR.

23:51.800 --> 23:53.640
EVEN AS A LITTLE KID
YOU HATED BEING WRONG.

23:53.680 --> 23:54.930
&lt;CELLPHONE RINGING&gt;
WRONG?

23:54.970 --> 23:56.470
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT, "WRONG?"

23:57.140 --> 23:59.230
HELLO?
HEY.

23:59.270 --> 24:02.100
I MIGHT BE PARANOID,
BUT I THINK SOMEONE'S
WATCHING ME.

24:02.150 --> 24:04.190
YOU'RE HOT AND YOU'RE BLONDE.
OF COURSE PEOPLE
ARE WATCHING YOU.

24:04.230 --> 24:05.980
I'M SERIOUS.

24:06.020 --> 24:07.610
I'M PRETTY SURE
I'M UNDER SURVEILLANCE.

24:07.650 --> 24:09.190
I... JUST...

24:09.240 --> 24:11.530
I'LL CALL YOU BACK
IN A FEW MINUTES, OKAY?

24:11.570 --> 24:13.700
-WHAT IS IT?
-LESLIE THINKS SOMEONE'S
FOLLOWING HER

24:13.740 --> 24:15.370
OR WATCHING HER OR SOMETHING.

24:15.410 --> 24:16.620
DID YOU SLEEP WITH HER?

24:16.660 --> 24:17.950
EXCUSE ME?
LESLIE.

24:17.990 --> 24:19.830
WHENEVER YOU DO SOMETHING BAD,
YOU ALWAYS OVERCOMPENSATE

24:19.870 --> 24:20.910
AND DO SOMETHING
GOOD FOR SOMEONE.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.540
MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS,
ALL RIGHT?

24:22.580 --> 24:23.790
THAT'S HOW YOU ENDED UP
MARRIED TO NIKKI, REMEMBER?

24:23.830 --> 24:25.340
HOW MANY NECKLACES
THAT COST YA?

24:25.380 --> 24:26.670
I SAID--

24:26.710 --> 24:27.590
&lt;TIRES SCREECHING&gt;

24:27.630 --> 24:29.380
WHAT'RE YOU,
TWO YEARS OLD?

24:31.010 --> 24:32.510
HEY, WHAT THE HELL?

24:32.550 --> 24:33.840
WHAT'RE YOU DOING?

24:36.350 --> 24:37.600
&lt;TIRES SCREECHING&gt;

24:45.730 --> 24:47.520
SO.

24:47.570 --> 24:50.190
I'M GUESSING
YOU GUYS AREN'T...
AREN'T FROM TOWN, HUH?

24:50.780 --> 24:51.530

25:03.790 --> 25:04.790
MR. DOYLE.

25:06.290 --> 25:07.630
I'M I AM INSPECTOR TARRANT.

25:08.880 --> 25:10.590
SORRY ABOUT THE DRAMATICS.

25:10.630 --> 25:11.880
FEDS, EH?

25:11.920 --> 25:13.800
LET ME GUESS.
ARE YOU THE GUYS
WHO'VE BEEN FOLLOWING

25:13.840 --> 25:15.640
LESLIE BENNETT AROUND?

25:15.680 --> 25:16.800
THAT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

25:17.640 --> 25:19.430
OKAY.

25:19.470 --> 25:21.180
WE HAVE INFORMATION
THAT YOU WERE AT A CERTAIN
RESTAURANT LAST NIGHT

25:21.220 --> 25:22.730
AND THAT YOU'RE WORKING
FOR THE MAYOR.

25:22.770 --> 25:24.140
OH, THAT'S NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS.

25:24.190 --> 25:26.310
SEE? DOESN'T FEEL SO NICE
WHEN IT'S SAID TO YOU,
NOW DOES IT?

25:27.190 --> 25:28.940
DROP THE CASE, MR. DOYLE.

25:28.980 --> 25:30.480
WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT?

25:31.990 --> 25:33.610
YOU KNOW, A GUNMAN IS DEAD,

25:33.650 --> 25:34.950
A JUDGE IS BEING BLACKMAILED.

25:34.990 --> 25:36.030
THE LESS YOU KNOW,
THE SAFER YOU'LL BE.

25:37.530 --> 25:39.280
THIS IS REALLY ABOUT
MAYOR BILL, ISN'T IT?

25:39.330 --> 25:40.620
THAT'S WHO YOU'RE AFTER.

25:40.660 --> 25:42.910
AT THE FEAR OF SOUNDING RUDE
YET AGAIN,

25:42.950 --> 25:44.290
IT REALLY IS NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS.

25:45.620 --> 25:47.080
JUST STAY OUT OF IT.

25:59.010 --> 26:00.260
HELLO?

26:04.810 --> 26:06.350
YOU OKAY?
I WAS JUST ABOUT
TO CALL THE COPS.

26:06.390 --> 26:08.650
YEAH, WELL
IT WAS THE COPS
WHO PICKED ME UP.

26:08.690 --> 26:11.480
-WHAT'D THEY WANT?
-I DON'T KNOW. THEY WANT US
OFF THIS CASE.

26:11.520 --> 26:13.530
-I DON'T KNOW WHY,
THEY WOULDN'T TELL ME.
-&lt;PHONE RINGING&gt;

26:13.570 --> 26:15.820
WE NEED TO FIND OUT
WHO'S BLACKMAILING THAT JUDGE.

26:15.860 --> 26:17.070
&lt;JAKE&gt; I SHOULD'VE
CALLED YOU BACK.

26:17.110 --> 26:18.990
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?
OH, WELL, I WAS ARRESTED,

26:19.030 --> 26:21.030
SORT OF.

26:21.080 --> 26:22.910
WHAT'RE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
WE'RE NOT LOOKING FOR YOU.

26:22.950 --> 26:25.040
YEAH, WELL IT WASN'T YOU.
IT WAS THE FEDS.

26:25.080 --> 26:27.250
THAT'S WHO'S FOLLOWING ME,
ISN'T IT?

26:27.290 --> 26:28.710
WHY WOULD THEY BE
FOLLOWING YOU?

26:28.750 --> 26:30.710
YOU'VE GOT NOTHING
TO HIDE, RIGHT?

26:32.050 --> 26:33.300
RIGHT.

26:34.510 --> 26:35.590
I'LL TALK TO YOU.

26:38.680 --> 26:40.010
WHAT?

26:40.050 --> 26:41.890
I JUST LOOKED UP SOME STUFF
ON THE JUDGE,

26:41.930 --> 26:43.140
CHECKED OUT HIS DOCKET.

26:43.180 --> 26:44.520
HE'S HEADING UP
A BIG PROVINCIAL INQUIRY.

26:45.730 --> 26:47.310
LOOKING INTO KICKBACKS
AT CITY HALL.

26:48.690 --> 26:50.270
TO THE TUNE
OF 20 MILLION DOLLARS.

26:50.730 --> 26:51.610
REALLY?

26:52.610 --> 26:53.650
BILL: HEY!

26:57.240 --> 26:58.240
WHY SO GLUM?

26:58.990 --> 27:00.490
THIS IS UNEXPECTED.

27:00.530 --> 27:02.280
YEAH, I WAS JUST DOWN
THE HALL. THOUGHT I'D
COME BY AND SAY HI.

27:07.500 --> 27:10.130
SO, GOOD DAY? BAD DAY?

27:10.170 --> 27:13.500
AVERAGE.
BAD GUYS TELLING LIES.
SAME OLD.

27:14.420 --> 27:15.760
OH... OH, UM,

27:15.800 --> 27:18.170
YOU DON'T HAPPEN TO KNOW
WHAT JAKE DOYLE'S WORKING ON
NOW, DO YOU?

27:19.470 --> 27:22.510
NO, UH, NO IDEA.
WHY D'YOU ASK?

27:22.550 --> 27:25.600
WELL, A FRIEND HIRED HIM
AND WAS WONDERING
ABOUT HIS LEVEL OF DISCRETION,

27:25.640 --> 27:26.730
SO, UH--
JAKE'S?

27:26.770 --> 27:28.480
YEAH.

27:28.520 --> 27:30.850
JAKE WOULDN'T TELL ANYBODY
ABOUT A CLIENT
IF HE WAS ASKED NOT TO.

27:30.900 --> 27:32.730
YEAH. THAT'S
WHAT I THOUGHT. &lt;CHUCKLES&gt;

27:32.770 --> 27:34.320
UNLESS I ASKED HIM.

27:38.780 --> 27:39.700
OKAY. &lt;CHUCKLES&gt;

27:41.570 --> 27:43.410
I SHOULD GET BACK TO WORK.

27:43.450 --> 27:44.700
YEAH, UM, SURE.

27:46.200 --> 27:47.750
HEY, HAVE A GOOD DAY.

27:48.250 --> 27:49.290
'KAY.

27:57.510 --> 27:58.840
HEY, HI.

27:58.880 --> 28:00.220
WE ARE JUST TRACKING
SOME STUFF DOWN
ON JEAN FRANCIS.

28:00.260 --> 28:02.550
YEAH. SO IT TURNS OUT
THAT SHE'S FROM
SERIOUS FAMILY MONEY.

28:02.590 --> 28:05.180
LIKE IT STARTED
WITH A GRAVEL PIT
AND TURNED INTO MILLIONS,

28:05.220 --> 28:06.640
AND SHE INHERITED EVERY CENT.

28:06.680 --> 28:08.730
WELL, OBVIOUSLY,
SHE WASN'T TRYING
TO HOLD UP A CARD GAME.

28:10.060 --> 28:11.690
KEEP LOOKING INTO HER

28:11.730 --> 28:14.810
SEE IF YOU CAN FIND
ANY CONNECTION TO HER
AND THE MAYOR OR TO CITY HALL.

28:14.860 --> 28:16.650
ARE WE GOING TO SEE
WHO I THINK WE ARE GOING
TO SEE?

28:20.900 --> 28:21.990
WHAT'S WRONG?

28:23.490 --> 28:24.620
MAYBE I AM NOT CUT OUT
TO BE A DETECTIVE.

28:25.870 --> 28:26.990
WHAT DOES CHRISTIAN HAVE
THAT I DON'T HAVE?

28:27.040 --> 28:28.660
&lt;SCOFFS&gt; THAT'S KIND OF
A COMPLICATED QUESTION.

28:29.450 --> 28:30.910
HIM AND JAKE ARE BROTHERS.

28:30.960 --> 28:32.580
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH!
BORN ONLY BY BLOOD!

28:32.620 --> 28:35.750
IF I COULD TAKE
JAKE'S BLOOD, I WOULD.

28:35.790 --> 28:39.960
OKAY, WHY DON'T YOU LOOK UP
EVERYTHING YOU CAN FIND
ON ALL THESE PEOPLE.

28:40.010 --> 28:41.130
YEAH?
YEAH.

28:41.170 --> 28:42.720
THINK HARD.
OKAY.

28:43.760 --> 28:45.010
OKAY, NOT TOO HARD.

28:45.050 --> 28:46.100
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE
HURTING YOURSELF.

28:47.310 --> 28:48.310
GO GET 'EM, TIGER.

28:49.600 --> 28:50.810
RIGHT, SURE, OKAY.

28:50.850 --> 28:52.690
WHO? WHO DO I GET?

28:52.730 --> 28:54.560
&lt;CHUCKLES&gt;

28:54.600 --> 28:56.520
[MALACHY] JAKE, M'BOY,
HOW ARE YA?

28:56.560 --> 28:58.530
JUST WANTED TO KNOW
WHAT CASE YOU'RE ON.

28:59.190 --> 29:00.440
IF YOU NEED HELP.

29:00.490 --> 29:02.360
YEAH, I COULD USE YOUR HELP
TO BE HONEST.

29:02.400 --> 29:04.490
HOW'RE YOU AND CHRISTIAN?
YOU GETTING ALONG?

29:04.530 --> 29:05.910
YOU SHOULD. YOU'RE BROTHERS.

29:05.950 --> 29:07.870
WE'RE JUST DOING FINE.
HE'S DOING
A GOOD JOB, ACTUALLY.

29:07.910 --> 29:09.080
JUST DON'T TELL HIM
I SAID THAT.

29:09.120 --> 29:10.660
I REMEMBER THE DAY
YOU WERE BORN.

29:10.700 --> 29:12.330
PART OF ME WAS HOPING
FOR ANOTHER GIRL,

29:12.370 --> 29:15.920
BUT YOU MAKE THE MOST
OF WHAT YOU GOT.

29:15.960 --> 29:17.790
OKAY, DAD,
HOW MANY OF THOSE PILLS

29:17.840 --> 29:19.800
[JAKE] HAVE YOU TAKEN?
ROSE PAYS THE BILLS.

29:19.840 --> 29:21.880
NO, THE PILLS. FOR YOUR BACK.

29:21.920 --> 29:22.970
HOW MANY HAVE YOU TAKEN?

29:23.010 --> 29:24.880
SHH, NO DRINKING AND DIALING.
GOT TO GO.

29:24.930 --> 29:25.800
HELLO.

29:25.840 --> 29:26.850
WHAT'RE WE DOING HERE?

29:28.850 --> 29:29.850
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

29:30.890 --> 29:33.100
THAT I'M HAPPY
JAKE'S NOT A DAUGHTER!

29:33.140 --> 29:34.980
OH, DEAR GOD.

29:35.020 --> 29:36.190
WAIT HERE.
WHY?

29:36.230 --> 29:37.360
WHAT'RE YOU GONNA DO?

29:37.400 --> 29:39.690
SOMETHING I SHOULD'VE DONE
A LONG TIME AGO.

29:39.730 --> 29:41.030
[JAKE] I GOTTA TALK TO YOU.

29:41.070 --> 29:42.490
THIS HAS TO BE QUICK, JAKE.

29:42.530 --> 29:44.280
OKAY, SOMEONE'S USING
THOSE PHOTOS
FROM THE POKER GAME

29:44.320 --> 29:45.950
TO BLACKMAIL A JUDGE.

29:45.990 --> 29:47.990
A JUDGE WHO JUST HAPPENS TO BE
HEADING UP AN INQUIRY

29:48.030 --> 29:50.080
INTO KICKBACKS AT CITY HALL.

29:50.120 --> 29:52.950
NOW, YOU WOULDN'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT THAT,
WOULD YOU?

29:53.000 --> 29:54.830
&lt;CLICKS TONGUE&gt;
INQUIRY'S CONFIDENTIAL.

29:54.870 --> 29:56.920
IF YOU'RE INVOLVED IN THIS,
TELL ME RIGHT NOW.

29:56.960 --> 29:58.880
JAKE, I'M THE ONE
THAT ASKED YOU TO FIND
THE CAMERA.

29:58.920 --> 30:00.920
WHY WOULD I DO THAT
IF I WAS BEHIND IT?

30:00.960 --> 30:02.630
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE YOUR HIRED BLACKMAILERS

30:02.670 --> 30:04.800
TURNED THE TABLES ON YOU.
IT'S MOTIVE ENOUGH
TO KILL SOMEBODY.

30:04.840 --> 30:08.180
KILLED? YOU'RE PARANOID.
I... I AM THE MAYOR
OF ST. JOHN'S.

30:08.220 --> 30:09.680
I DON'T HAVE PEOPLE KILLED!

30:09.720 --> 30:14.020
NOW, YOU LISTEN TO ME.
I WANNA MAKE MYSELF
VERY, VERY CLEAR HERE.

30:14.060 --> 30:16.060
IF YOU'RE INTO ANYTHING,
ANYTHING AT ALL

30:16.100 --> 30:17.980
THAT MIGHT END UP
HURTING LESLIE...

30:18.020 --> 30:20.980
OH, OKAY, I SEE, I SEE.
SO YOU'RE GONNA
PROTECT LESLIE?

30:22.030 --> 30:23.990
BELIEVE ME,
SHE DOES NOT NEED YOU.

30:25.860 --> 30:26.860
IS THAT RIGHT?
BECAUSE LESLIE KNOWS

30:26.900 --> 30:29.950
THAT SHE IS FAR,
FAR ABOVE YOU.

30:31.870 --> 30:33.120
I'M SORRY, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

30:33.160 --> 30:35.040
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

30:35.080 --> 30:37.750
STOP DREAMING. IT'S PATHETIC.

30:42.250 --> 30:44.050
&lt;GROANS&gt;

30:44.460 --> 30:45.720
OW!

30:45.760 --> 30:46.760
LOOK AT ME.

30:47.050 --> 30:48.470
LOOK AT ME!

30:48.510 --> 30:50.600
IF I FIND OUT YOU'RE DIRTY,

30:50.640 --> 30:53.970
AND WHATEVER CRAP
YOU'RE INTO HURTS LESLIE,

30:55.560 --> 30:57.190
WE WILL CONTINUE
THIS LITTLE CHAT.

30:57.230 --> 30:58.480
JAKE.

31:06.190 --> 31:08.200
TINNY. TINNY!
WHAT?

31:08.240 --> 31:11.320
I THINK I FOUND A REAL,
HONEST-TO-GOD
INVESTIGATIVE CLUE.

31:13.030 --> 31:13.990
&lt;SIGHS&gt;

31:15.160 --> 31:16.450
YOU COULD BE MORE EXCITED!

31:17.750 --> 31:18.750
WHAT?

31:20.460 --> 31:21.670
&lt;CAR ALARM TURNING ON&gt;

31:43.770 --> 31:45.230
&lt;CHRISTIAN&gt; COME ON, JAKE.

31:45.270 --> 31:46.940
THE JUDGE ISN'T GONNA WANT
TO SEE US ANYMORE
THAN HE DID BEFORE.

31:46.980 --> 31:48.900
NO, HE'S GOT TO KNOW
WHO THE BLACKMAILER IS.

31:48.950 --> 31:50.110
HOW DO YOU FIGURE?

31:50.150 --> 31:52.160
WELL, HE TOLD US TO GIVE
A MESSAGE TO THE COWARD,

31:52.200 --> 31:54.030
SO, THAT MEANS
HE PROBABLY KNOWS
WHO THE COWARD ACTUALLY IS.

31:54.080 --> 31:55.830
YEAH, WELL HE'S NOT
ABOUT TO TELL US,

31:55.870 --> 31:57.700
SO, LET'S GET OUT OF HERE
BEFORE SOMEONE CATCHES US.

32:01.250 --> 32:02.540
UM, CHRISTIAN?

32:02.580 --> 32:03.710
WHAT?

32:04.960 --> 32:06.840
LOOKS LIKE
HE WON'T BE INVESTIGATING

32:06.880 --> 32:08.630
ANY KICKBACKS
INTO CITY HALL AGAIN.

32:17.350 --> 32:18.890
SOMEONE KILLED JUDGE NELSON.

32:18.930 --> 32:20.060
OH, MY GOD!

32:20.100 --> 32:22.770
YEAH, WITH THE SAME CALIBER
GUN THAT KILLED HARRY HOLDEN

32:22.810 --> 32:23.860
WHOEVER DID, DID BOTH OF THEM.

32:24.690 --> 32:26.150
WHAT THE HELL IS ALL THIS?

32:26.190 --> 32:29.030
DES TOOK IT ON.
HE JUST LOOKED UP EVERYTHING
HE COULD FIND

32:29.070 --> 32:30.570
ON EVERY SINGLE
PERSON INVOLVED.

32:30.610 --> 32:31.650
PRETTY IMPRESSIVE.

32:31.700 --> 32:32.990
YOU GOTTA LISTEN
TO WHAT HE FOUND.

32:33.030 --> 32:34.240
I THINK
HE ACTUALLY PULLED IT OFF
THIS TIME.

32:34.280 --> 32:36.780
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, OKAY.
SO, I STARTED BY GOING
INTO JEAN FRANCIS'

32:36.830 --> 32:38.040
FAMILY MONEY RIGHT?
&lt;KNOCK ON DOOR&gt;

32:38.080 --> 32:39.160
OH! HOLD THAT THOUGHT.

32:44.500 --> 32:46.130
HI.
HEY.

32:46.170 --> 32:48.250
UH...

32:48.300 --> 32:50.550
LOOK, I HAVE SOMETHING
I HAVE TO TELL YOU.

32:50.590 --> 32:52.010
I PUNCHED BILL.
YOU PUNCHED BILL

32:54.260 --> 32:56.050
YEAH. I GUESS HE TOLD YOU.

32:56.100 --> 32:57.060
HE MUST'VE TOLD YOU.

32:57.100 --> 33:00.180
NO. HE HAS A BLACK EYE
AND I KNOW HE MET WITH YOU.

33:00.220 --> 33:01.060
DID THE MATH.

33:02.980 --> 33:04.230
ANYTHING ELSE
YOU NEED TO TELL ME?

33:04.270 --> 33:06.020
YEAH.

33:06.060 --> 33:07.110
YOU MIGHT WANNA COME IN.

33:14.110 --> 33:16.120
LOOK, JUST CAUSE
HE WAS PLAYING POKER

33:16.160 --> 33:17.620
WHEN HE SAID
HE WAS PLAYING HOCKEY

33:17.660 --> 33:18.870
DOESN'T MEAN HE'S CORRUPT.

33:18.910 --> 33:20.040
HE KNEW I WOULDN'T APPROVE.

33:20.080 --> 33:22.210
RIGHT, AND I'M SURE
THERE'S A LOT OF GUYS

33:22.250 --> 33:25.830
WHO SAY THEY LEASED A CAR
WHEN THEY ACTUALLY PAID CASH.

33:25.880 --> 33:28.380
AND THE JUDGE WAS LOOKING
INTO KICKBACKS AT CITY HALL?

33:28.420 --> 33:30.050
IT DOESN'T MEAN
HE WOULD'VE FOUND ANYTHING,

33:30.090 --> 33:32.090
OR THAT'S WHY
HE WAS BEING BLACKMAILED.

33:33.720 --> 33:35.050
RIGHT.

33:35.090 --> 33:36.550
AND YOU DON'T THINK SO?

33:38.810 --> 33:39.890
DOESN'T MATTER WHAT I THINK.

33:40.970 --> 33:42.350
WELL, BILL COULDN'T
KILL ANYBODY.

33:45.230 --> 33:46.150
GIVE THAT BACK TO BILL.

33:47.520 --> 33:49.110
HE'LL TELL ME
ABOUT ALL THIS
WHEN HE'S READY.

33:51.230 --> 33:52.240
&lt;DOOR OPENS&gt;

33:52.860 --> 33:53.950
&lt;DOOR CLOSES&gt;

33:53.990 --> 33:54.990
&lt;SIGHS&gt;

33:56.110 --> 33:57.570
SHE'S STANDING
BY HER MAN, ISN'T SHE?

33:57.620 --> 34:00.080
YEAH, BUT I'M PRETTY SURE
HE'S NOT WORTH IT.

34:00.120 --> 34:02.290
UNCLE JAKE.

34:02.330 --> 34:04.790
OH, YEAH, RIGHT.
SORRY, DES. GO AHEAD.

34:04.830 --> 34:07.380
ALL RIGHT. SO, I STARTED
BY LOOKING INTO JEAN FRANCIS'
FAMILY MONEY,

34:07.420 --> 34:08.750
CHECKING THE VARIOUS
GENERATIONS,

34:08.790 --> 34:10.750
THE COMPANIES
THAT FOUNDED AND GREW,

34:10.800 --> 34:12.170
AND THEN I TOOK
THE JUDGES RESULTS
AND I STARTED

34:12.210 --> 34:13.800
CROSS-ANALYZING AND--
[TINNY] DES!

34:13.840 --> 34:15.220
JUST CUT TO IT, NOW.
-ALL RIGHT.

34:15.260 --> 34:17.800
SO, UH, AFTER MAYOR BILL
WAS ELECTED,

34:17.840 --> 34:19.300
THIS COMPANY CALLED
NEWFOUNDLAND CONCRETE

34:19.350 --> 34:21.760
STARTED DOING
A LOT OF BUSINESS
WITH THE CITY.

34:21.810 --> 34:24.640
YEAH, LIKE 12 MILLION DOLLARS
WORTH OF BUSINESS
LAST YEAR ALONE.

34:24.680 --> 34:26.060
THAT'S A LOT OF SIDEWALKS.

34:26.100 --> 34:27.560
I SEE THEIR TRUCKS
ALL OVER TOWN. SO WHAT?

34:27.600 --> 34:30.860
NEWFOUNDLAND CONCRETE
IS OWNED
BY JEAN FRANCIS'S FAMILY.

34:33.070 --> 34:34.570
REALLY?

34:39.910 --> 34:40.950
WHERE'D YOU GET THIS PICTURE?

34:41.450 --> 34:43.240
AT THE FOUNDATION.

34:43.290 --> 34:45.870
REMEMBER I TOLD YOU
THERE WAS A PICTURE OF JEAN
AND THE MAYOR ON THE WALL?

34:45.910 --> 34:47.920
YEAH. THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE
INTERESTING HERE.

34:49.210 --> 34:51.000
HARRY HOLDEN'S MUG SHOT,
GIVE IT TO ME.

34:51.040 --> 34:52.920
TRY AND STOP ME!
HEY, I GOT IT, I GOT IT.

34:55.260 --> 34:58.180
NOW, THE LAST TIME
I SAW HARRY HOLDEN
HE WAS DEAD,

34:58.220 --> 35:00.680
BUT I'M PRETTY SURE
THIS IS THE SAME GUY.

35:02.350 --> 35:03.390
&lt;DES&gt; MMM-HMM

35:04.680 --> 35:06.350
DES, YOU DID NICE WORK.

35:06.390 --> 35:07.640
GREAT WORK, ACTUALLY.

35:07.690 --> 35:08.850
THANKS! THANKS. OH MAN,
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,

35:08.900 --> 35:10.270
WITH THE NEW PROMOTION
AND EVERYTHING I THOUGHT...

35:10.310 --> 35:11.980
&lt;CELLPHONE RINGING&gt;

35:12.020 --> 35:13.230
I SHOULD REALLY STEP IT
UP, YOU KNOW? SO...

35:14.230 --> 35:15.610
YEAH?

35:15.650 --> 35:16.940
[WALTER] DUDE. YEAH, IT'S ME.

35:16.990 --> 35:18.990
UH, LOOK.
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BELIEVE THIS,

35:19.030 --> 35:21.410
BUT YOUR OLD PAL MAYOR BILL
AND JEAN FRANCIS?

35:21.450 --> 35:23.620
THEY'RE HERE.
THEY'RE AT THE LUCKY DRAGON,
RIGHT NOW.

35:24.950 --> 35:27.410
TRAGICALLY, I SEE NO HOOKERS.

35:27.460 --> 35:30.540
OKAY, YOU KEEP THEM
THERE, ALL RIGHT?
I'M ON MY WAY.

35:30.580 --> 35:33.290
JEAN FRANCIS AND THE MAYOR,
THEY WENT BACK
TO THE POKER GAME.

35:33.340 --> 35:35.380
WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT
WITH ALL OF THIS HEAT
AROUND THEM?

35:35.420 --> 35:37.300
GAMBLERS... GAMBLE?

35:37.340 --> 35:38.760
NO. I'M PRETTY SURE
THIS AIN'T ABOUT GAMBLING.

35:38.800 --> 35:40.180
GIMME THAT.

35:40.220 --> 35:41.720
LET'S GO, BROTHER!

35:44.220 --> 35:45.260
&lt;JAKE&gt; WELL, HELLO, THERE!

35:46.350 --> 35:48.310
WALTER, MOVE OVER.
[WALTER] HEY, UH...

35:48.350 --> 35:49.890
DON'T HAVE A COUPLE OF BUCKS
TO LOAN ME, DO YA?

35:49.940 --> 35:52.520
NO, I DON'T.
HOW YOU GETTIN' ON, BILL?

35:52.560 --> 35:53.860
UH, FINE. &lt;LAUGHS&gt;

35:53.900 --> 35:55.190
NOW, I AM GLAD
EVERYONE'S HERE,

35:55.230 --> 35:57.240
'CAUSE WE'RE NOT PLAYING
FOR MATCHSTICKS.

36:02.320 --> 36:06.080
EVERYONE'S LITTLE SQUEAKY
CLEAN REPUTATION
IS ON THE LINE.

36:07.410 --> 36:09.540
WELL, IT'S ALL BACK SAFE
AND SOUND,

36:09.580 --> 36:11.420
AND, UH, IT WAS REALLY NICE
OF YOU TO BRING THESE BACK,

36:11.460 --> 36:12.790
SO, THANKS.
THANK YOU.

36:12.830 --> 36:15.460
OH, NO, NO. NO.
THESE AREN'T
THE ACTUAL PHOTOS.

36:15.500 --> 36:18.300
THESE ARE DUPLICATES.
YOU SEE, THE COPS HAVE
THE REAL ONES.

36:18.840 --> 36:20.420
REALLY?
YEAH, THE COPS.

36:20.470 --> 36:21.380
YOU KNOW?

36:21.430 --> 36:23.430
LIKE, LESLIE BENNETT?
YOU'VE HEARD OF HER, RIGHT?

36:23.470 --> 36:25.260
SHE'S SEEN THESE.

36:25.300 --> 36:28.310
SHE KNOWS ALL
ABOUT THE BLACKMAILING
OF OUR DEAD JUDGE,

36:28.350 --> 36:31.270
SHE EVEN KNOWS
ABOUT THE INVESTIGATION
INTO CITY HALL.

36:31.310 --> 36:33.310
BUT IT'S NOT
JUST THE TAKING OF THE BRIBES

36:33.350 --> 36:35.230
THAT THE COPS
ARE INVESTIGATING, IS IT?

36:35.270 --> 36:38.320
THEY'RE ALSO LOOKING
INTO WHO'S DOING THE BRIBING.

36:38.440 --> 36:39.860
MMM.

36:39.900 --> 36:41.360
WHY ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME?

36:41.400 --> 36:42.410
EXCELLENT QUESTION.

36:44.530 --> 36:45.700
HARRY HOLDEN.

36:45.740 --> 36:46.990
ANYBODY?

36:47.030 --> 36:48.700
GUY WITH THE MASK? THE GUN?

36:48.740 --> 36:50.620
RIPPED OFF THE CARD GAME?
TOOK PICTURES OF YOU ALL,

36:50.660 --> 36:52.250
YOU KNOW, WITH HOT CHICKS?

36:53.460 --> 36:55.330
SOMEONE KILLED HIM,
AND YOU KNOW 'EM.

36:59.960 --> 37:02.470
NOPE. NO, I DON'T KNOW
THAT MAN.

37:02.510 --> 37:04.890
I HAVE MY PICTURE TAKEN
WITH ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE.

37:04.930 --> 37:06.260
I RUN A FOUNDATION.

37:07.930 --> 37:10.220
HMM, YOU ALSO OWN NEWFOUNDLAND
CONCRETE, DON'T YOU?

37:11.730 --> 37:13.270
I'M JUST CURIOUS,

37:13.310 --> 37:14.350
HOW MUCH MONEY WOULD YOU LOSE

37:14.400 --> 37:17.570
IF YOU COULDN'T
BRIBE YOUR WAY
INTO CITY HALL BUSINESS?

37:17.610 --> 37:20.650
OR IF YOU WENT TO JAIL,
SAY, FOR FRAUD?

37:20.690 --> 37:22.860
I... I DIDN'T, I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT THIS.

37:22.900 --> 37:24.950
I... I'VE NEVER TAKEN
A BRIBE IN MY LIFE.

37:24.990 --> 37:26.200
I... I WOULD...

37:26.240 --> 37:27.370
REALLY?
YEAH.

37:28.870 --> 37:29.990
&lt;JAKE&gt; IS THAT TRUE, JEAN?

37:30.040 --> 37:31.500
YOU'RE GONNA STAND ALONE
IN ALL THIS?

37:31.540 --> 37:34.330
NOW, I'M GUESSING HARRY,
HE HAD THE GUN,
HE PULLED IT ON YOU

37:34.370 --> 37:36.000
AND SOMEHOW
YOU GOT A HOLD OF IT, RIGHT?

37:36.040 --> 37:37.420
HE TRIED TO TURN THE TABLES
ON YA,

37:37.460 --> 37:39.300
YOU HAD TO SHOOT HIM.

37:39.340 --> 37:40.460
AND THE JUDGE,
WHAT HAPPENED THERE?

37:40.500 --> 37:41.800
HE WOULDN'T PLAY ALONG...
NO...

37:41.840 --> 37:43.420
...SO, YOU OFFED HIM?
&lt;LAUGHS&gt;

37:46.430 --> 37:48.350
EVERYBODY JUST STAY
WHERE YOU ARE.

37:48.390 --> 37:50.180
WHAT'RE YOU GONNA DO?
SHOOT ALL OF US?

37:50.220 --> 37:51.770
JUST YOU
IF YOU DON'T SHUT UP!

37:56.520 --> 37:58.060
JAKE!
YEAH, I GOT THIS.

37:58.110 --> 37:59.690
&lt;CROWD GASPING&gt;

38:00.980 --> 38:02.690
&lt;WHISTLING&gt;
GIVE ME THAT!

38:03.820 --> 38:05.240
&lt;JEAN GRUNTS&gt;

38:05.280 --> 38:06.360
MOVE! MOVE IT!

38:08.410 --> 38:09.950
DON'T BE STUPID, JEAN!

38:09.990 --> 38:11.450
WHERE'RE YOU GOING?
&lt;GUNSHOT&gt;

38:12.620 --> 38:14.250
I AM NOT GOING TO JAIL!

38:14.290 --> 38:15.870
I'M PRETTY SURE
YOU ARE, ACTUALLY.

38:15.920 --> 38:17.170
IT'S NOT JUST ME, YOU KNOW.

38:17.210 --> 38:19.670
THERE ARE LOTS OF PEOPLE
INVOLVED IN THIS!

38:19.710 --> 38:21.420
OKAY, I CAN WORK WITH THAT.

38:21.460 --> 38:22.420
SO, LET'S TALK TO THE FEDS.

38:22.460 --> 38:24.050
MAYBE WE CAN MAKE A DEAL.

38:24.090 --> 38:26.380
I KILLED TWO PEOPLE.
THERE'LL BE NO DEALS.

38:26.430 --> 38:28.510
IT WASN'T SUPPOSED
TO GO LIKE THIS.

38:28.550 --> 38:30.510
I WAS GOING TO BE DISGRACED.

38:32.060 --> 38:34.140
OKAY, JEAN, I'M COMING OUT.

38:34.180 --> 38:36.190
JUST DON'T SHOOT, ALL RIGHT?

38:36.230 --> 38:37.310
JEAN,

38:39.480 --> 38:41.070
YOU GOTTA TURN YOURSELF IN.

38:42.070 --> 38:43.190
NO!
&lt;GUNSHOT&gt;

38:44.490 --> 38:45.740
OKAY, PLEASE STOP
SHOOTING AT ME!

38:48.360 --> 38:50.280
&lt;VEHICLE APPROACHING&gt;

38:50.320 --> 38:52.490
JEAN? JEAN!

38:52.540 --> 38:53.540
&lt;TIRES SCREECHING&gt;

39:06.420 --> 39:07.720
&lt;POLICE SIREN BLARING&gt;

39:13.600 --> 39:15.430
WHAT DID SHE SAY?

39:17.560 --> 39:18.850
THAT SHE WASN'T
THE ONLY ONE INVOLVED.

39:20.600 --> 39:21.810
THAT THERE ARE OTHERS.

39:27.900 --> 39:30.360
YOU'RE DETERMINED TO MAKE THIS
YOUR BUSINESS, AREN'T YOU?

39:30.410 --> 39:31.410
YOU WANNA TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED HERE?

39:32.660 --> 39:33.950
NOT SURE
IF I EVEN KNOW MYSELF.

39:44.670 --> 39:46.630
SO, HOW DID YOU FIND
YOUR ONE DAY OFF?

39:46.670 --> 39:47.840
DID IT KILL YOU?

39:47.880 --> 39:49.380
IT WAS FUN, ACTUALLY.

39:50.130 --> 39:51.470
REALLY?
MMM.

39:51.510 --> 39:53.010
SO, I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT ASKING FOR A RAISE,
YOU KNOW?

39:53.050 --> 39:54.430
OR A DESK AT LEAST.

39:54.470 --> 39:55.510
YEAH, I WOULDN'T PUSH IT.

39:57.430 --> 39:59.810
POPPY? WELL YOU'RE
FEELING WAY BETTER.

39:59.850 --> 40:02.310
WHAT? OH, YES.

40:02.350 --> 40:04.190
WELL, I'M GLAD YOU ENJOYED
YOUR SICK DAY.

40:04.230 --> 40:06.070
ALTHOUGH I THINK
YOU WERE FAKING IT
TO GET UNCLE JAKE

40:06.110 --> 40:08.990
AND UNCLE CHRISTIAN
TO SPEND MORE TIME TOGETHER.
AM I RIGHT?

40:09.030 --> 40:11.200
NO FLIES ON THIS ONE.

40:11.240 --> 40:14.580
SO, UH, HOW'D THEY MAKE OUT?
EITHER ONE KILL THE OTHER?

40:14.620 --> 40:16.620
I SOLVED EVERYTHING,
TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST.

40:16.660 --> 40:19.540
UNCLE JAKE PUNCHED THE MAYOR
AND A COUPLE
OTHER THINGS HAPPENED,

40:19.580 --> 40:20.580
BUT THEY GOT ON ALL RIGHT.

40:24.210 --> 40:25.710
WHAT?
MMM-MMM.

40:25.750 --> 40:27.090
I LIKE HAVING YOU HERE.

40:27.130 --> 40:28.960
NOBODY'S POINTING
A GUN AT YOUR FACE,

40:29.010 --> 40:30.550
OR CHASING YOU AROUND
IN A CAR.

40:30.590 --> 40:33.970
CHECK THE BANK ACCOUNT AGAIN.
CUDDLING ON THE STREET'S
NOT SO NICE, IS IT?

40:34.850 --> 40:37.600
OKAY. YOU'RE RIGHT.

40:38.720 --> 40:39.890
HEY,

40:39.930 --> 40:41.810
I HEARD WHAT HAPPENED.
IT'S HORRIBLE.

40:41.850 --> 40:43.560
YEAH, IT WAS PRETTY HORRIFIC.

40:44.520 --> 40:46.900
BILL KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT.

40:46.940 --> 40:48.650
THE BRIBES,
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

40:48.690 --> 40:50.360
YEAH, HE TOLD ME THAT TOO.

40:53.240 --> 40:55.240
ANYWAY, YOU DIDN'T
HAPPEN TO...

40:56.740 --> 41:00.290
DROP ANYTHING OFF
AT MY PLACE,
LIKE A NECKLACE, MAYBE?

41:00.330 --> 41:03.670
YEAH, WE FOUND A PAWN TICKET
AT HARRY HOLDEN'S APARTMENT.

41:03.710 --> 41:05.500
WELL THANK YOU.
I APPRECIATE IT.

41:05.540 --> 41:07.210
IT'LL, UH, IT'LL LOOK
GREAT ON HER.

41:07.250 --> 41:08.300
SHE'S LUCKY.

41:09.460 --> 41:10.670
G'NIGHT,

41:10.710 --> 41:11.800
JAKE DOYLE.

41:13.760 --> 41:15.340
GOODNIGHT, LESLIE BENNETT.

41:17.010 --> 41:18.640
WHO'S THAT?

41:18.680 --> 41:19.520
JUST A FRIEND.

41:23.480 --> 41:25.310
I THINK YOU SHOULD RETHINK
YOUR FRIENDSHIP WITH JAKE

41:27.310 --> 41:29.190
I JUST DON'T TRUST HIM, HUN.
REALLY?

41:34.530 --> 41:36.660
I KNOW I DIDN'T TELL YOU
THE TRUTH
ABOUT THE OTHER NIGHT,

41:37.990 --> 41:40.540
AND I KNOW THAT I HAVE A BIT
OF A GAMBLING PROBLEM, BUT...

41:43.620 --> 41:45.080
I JUST NEED YOU TO KNOW

41:45.710 --> 41:46.880
THAT YOU CAN TRUST ME.

41:51.800 --> 41:52.920
DO YOU?

41:56.680 --> 41:58.680
STILL THINK THE MAYOR'S
INVOLVED IN THIS?

41:58.720 --> 42:00.930
I THINK THAT MAYBE
I AM JEALOUS

42:00.970 --> 42:02.560
AND I WANTED HIM TO BE DIRTY.

42:03.890 --> 42:05.230
MAYBE.

42:05.270 --> 42:07.730
MAYBE NOT.

42:07.770 --> 42:09.610
EITHER WAY,
IT WAS A PLEASURE WORKING
WITH YOU, BROTHER.

42:11.610 --> 42:14.030
I'M SORRY
THAT I ALMOST LOST
YOUR NECKLACE.

42:14.070 --> 42:16.320
WELL TECHNICALLY
YOU DIDN'T ALMOST LOSE IT.
YOU LOST IT.

42:16.360 --> 42:18.240
BUT LUCKILY,
I GOT IT BACK, SO...

42:18.280 --> 42:20.080
SO... CHEERS.

42:20.120 --> 42:21.370
CHEERS.

42:25.750 --> 42:27.630
ALL RIGHT. CALL ME A CAB,
WILL YA?

42:27.670 --> 42:29.460
CALL IT YOURSELF.

42:31.130 --> 42:32.380
&lt;MIMICKING&gt;
"CALL IT YOURSELF!"

42:34.800 --> 42:35.670
LATER.

42:46.940 --> 42:48.440
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

42:50.310 --> 42:53.650
I LOVE THAT IT'S BEEN
STOLEN AND PAWNED.

42:54.490 --> 42:55.650
IT'S VERY ROMANTIC.

42:56.240 --> 42:57.400
OH, YEAH?

42:58.860 --> 43:00.660
DOES THAT GET YOU ALL HOT
AND BOTHERED?

43:00.700 --> 43:03.200
YEAH. IT DOES.

43:03.240 --> 43:06.620
WELL YOU SHOULD ALSO KNOW
THAT IT DID SOME HARD TIME
IN THE POLICE LOCKUP.

43:07.000 --> 43:08.670
REALLY?
MMM-HMM.

43:10.130 --> 43:12.800
ALL THAT EFFORT.
IT'S TOO BAD IT'S GLASS.

43:12.840 --> 43:14.210
WHAT? GIMME THAT.

43:15.710 --> 43:16.630
HE SWITCHED IT!

43:17.340 --> 43:18.550
I'M KIDDING!

43:19.800 --> 43:20.680
&lt;LAUGHS&gt;

43:20.720 --> 43:22.600
AH, YOU ARE VERY MEAN.

43:23.640 --> 43:24.600
BUT IT IS VERY HOT.
