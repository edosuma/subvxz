05:24.991 --> 05:27.592
You're doing it again.

05:27.594 --> 05:29.094
You're interrupting.

05:35.101 --> 05:37.869
Dana: You woke me up
twice last night.

05:37.871 --> 05:39.471
I don't know how the guys

05:39.473 --> 05:41.807
are gonna put up with
you for three months.

05:41.809 --> 05:43.475
Was I good?

05:43.477 --> 05:46.078
Think you're getting nervous
about going on the road.

05:47.847 --> 05:50.048
Come here.

05:50.050 --> 05:51.917
Dana: You guys are gonna
be great.

05:51.919 --> 05:53.719
Don't worry about it.

05:53.721 --> 05:56.822
I know what I'm getting into,
nails.

05:59.692 --> 06:01.426
You're gonna stick with "nails,"
huh?

06:01.428 --> 06:02.794
You can't call me something
more traditional,

06:02.796 --> 06:05.564
like "babe" or "sweetheart"
or something?

06:05.566 --> 06:06.965
I don't know.

06:06.967 --> 06:10.469
I'm not traditional.
Neither are you.

06:16.576 --> 06:20.479
Come back to bed if you
want something traditional.

06:22.382 --> 06:23.915
Oh, god, oh!

06:25.385 --> 06:27.886
You call me nails
one more time...

06:27.888 --> 06:29.821
It's an amazing name.

06:29.823 --> 06:33.458
Do you know how awesome it is
to have a nickname like that?

06:35.027 --> 06:38.397
You would like
"dickface," et cetera?

06:38.399 --> 06:39.498
Oh, really?

06:39.500 --> 06:41.533
You don't like "dickface"?

06:41.535 --> 06:42.601
Mm, I like "nails."

06:42.603 --> 06:44.403
I like "dickface."

06:44.405 --> 06:45.771
I'll stop for now.

06:51.511 --> 06:53.545
I'm gonna miss you.

06:53.547 --> 06:55.580
You'd better.

06:55.582 --> 06:57.883
I had that dream
again last night.

06:57.885 --> 07:01.086
Oh! About the woods?

07:01.088 --> 07:03.121
The woods. The far woods.
It was special.

07:03.123 --> 07:05.791
It was peaceful.

07:05.793 --> 07:09.561
We could stay in bed
the weekend instead.

07:10.797 --> 07:12.597
Come on, you love camping.

07:12.599 --> 07:15.667
We can connect to our inner
caveman and cavewoman.

07:20.574 --> 07:22.674
Oh, god. Sorry.
Give me a second.

07:22.676 --> 07:23.942
You ok?

07:23.944 --> 07:26.611
Yeah, I just need
to take a shower.

07:46.466 --> 07:47.999
These are really good.

08:19.799 --> 08:21.600
Dana: Hi, this is Dana Baker

08:21.602 --> 08:23.568
calling to confirm
her appointment for Monday.

08:25.838 --> 08:29.007
Right, I need a ride.
Right, of course.

08:29.009 --> 08:31.810
Um, and if I change my mind...

08:35.648 --> 08:38.549
Uh, yes, I have.

08:38.552 --> 08:40.952
Yes, I do understand.
Ok, yeah.

08:40.953 --> 08:42.953
Ok, thank you.

08:42.956 --> 08:44.589
Who was that?

08:44.591 --> 08:48.026
Oh, I just double-booked
myself for Tuesday.

08:48.028 --> 08:49.895
You overpack?

08:49.897 --> 08:51.696
Whatever it takes.

08:57.904 --> 09:00.672
Happy anniversary.

09:00.674 --> 09:03.108
I thought we said no presents.

09:03.110 --> 09:04.876
Well, I can't take it back.

09:18.758 --> 09:21.293
Is it a compass?

09:23.663 --> 09:25.664
I love it, it's perfect.

09:30.603 --> 09:32.938
You're always such a shit.

09:35.074 --> 09:36.808
Thank you, baby.

09:36.810 --> 09:39.277
We could just pitch
a tent here instead.

09:39.279 --> 09:41.680
Where's the fun in that?

09:44.016 --> 09:46.184
Don't forget anything.

11:19.745 --> 11:21.279
Wait, wait, wait.

11:23.749 --> 11:25.283
You're so weird.

11:26.853 --> 11:28.987
Now...

11:28.989 --> 11:32.290
Think you love that camera
more than you love me.

11:32.292 --> 11:33.825
Maybe.

11:33.827 --> 11:35.927
Did you reach out to Jenny?

11:38.264 --> 11:40.265
No, but I will.

11:42.968 --> 11:46.438
Nails, you need
to make more friends.

11:46.440 --> 11:49.074
I don't want you moping
around the house

11:49.076 --> 11:50.909
for six months all alone.

11:50.911 --> 11:53.712
It's sweet that you're worried about me.
I'm fine.

12:05.825 --> 12:08.226
That bad?

12:08.228 --> 12:09.794
You're so fuckin' photogenic.

12:24.910 --> 12:26.911
You know, maybe
when you come back,

12:26.913 --> 12:29.514
we can have a conversation about
having a little rock star.

12:37.223 --> 12:38.957
Dana.

12:38.959 --> 12:40.258
You could teach him how
to play guitar.

12:40.260 --> 12:42.127
Dana, we're not that couple.

12:43.963 --> 12:45.430
What couple?

12:45.432 --> 12:48.433
Double deep in poop
and preschools.

12:52.304 --> 12:54.439
I don't know, you love
your brother's kids.

12:54.441 --> 12:56.975
Because I'm the cool uncle
and you're the cool aunt.

12:57.977 --> 12:59.310
We're the exciting couple

12:59.312 --> 13:01.212
that travels and has adventures.

13:04.216 --> 13:07.085
Well, having a family
is an adventure.

13:09.054 --> 13:13.424
Dana, we talked about this
when we got married.

13:13.426 --> 13:15.860
You were always the one
that said no kids.

13:20.332 --> 13:22.133
"Nails" suits you.

13:23.369 --> 13:25.103
"Mommy" doesn't.

13:32.011 --> 13:33.845
Sorry, I just...

13:37.183 --> 13:39.417
I don't know why you're
bringing this up now.

13:42.054 --> 13:44.422
Let's just enjoy the time
we have together, ok?

13:45.524 --> 13:47.125
All right.

13:47.127 --> 13:48.259
No stress?

13:52.932 --> 13:54.365
Did you make
the boat reservation?

13:56.035 --> 13:57.168
Shit.

15:44.410 --> 15:46.945
Hey. You ok?

15:46.947 --> 15:48.146
You got it?

18:01.613 --> 18:03.581
Let's do it.

18:14.626 --> 18:16.394
It's overgrown.

18:16.396 --> 18:18.329
Yeah.

18:27.272 --> 18:29.407
Charles: You ok?

18:29.409 --> 18:31.175
You ok?

18:31.177 --> 18:32.844
Yeah. Just gimme a sec.

18:32.846 --> 18:35.513
We can stop.

18:35.515 --> 18:38.683
You remember the echo?
Coo-coo!

18:40.553 --> 18:42.120
Oh!

18:42.122 --> 18:44.355
Man, it's beautiful up here
all alone.

18:44.357 --> 18:46.190
We're not alone.

18:48.695 --> 18:51.129
Dana: What is that,
a four-Wheeler?

18:51.131 --> 18:52.697
I guess.

18:52.699 --> 18:54.298
They got a shitty taste in beer.

18:54.300 --> 18:55.700
God.

18:55.702 --> 18:57.435
Let's head this way.

18:57.437 --> 18:58.769
Here.

18:58.771 --> 19:00.538
Come on.

19:09.815 --> 19:11.315
Come on!

19:22.528 --> 19:26.864
The guys... If we went down
to your studio for like an hour,

19:26.866 --> 19:28.866
just got a group shot
in the Van,

19:28.868 --> 19:31.302
we could put it on a t-shirt.

19:31.304 --> 19:33.304
Each venue, I don't know,

19:33.306 --> 19:35.339
the guys are saying we could
make a couple hundred bucks.

19:35.341 --> 19:37.542
Might come in handy.

19:37.544 --> 19:41.179
Dana: Yeah. Yeah,
i could do that. Sure.

19:47.186 --> 19:48.786
Watch out.

20:01.700 --> 20:04.402
I don't know
what is wrong with me.

20:04.404 --> 20:06.637
Never used to stop.

20:06.639 --> 20:08.372
You're getting old.

20:10.977 --> 20:12.910
Charles: Watch the water.
All right?

20:12.912 --> 20:14.312
Dana: Yeah.

20:14.314 --> 20:15.713
You good?

20:15.715 --> 20:17.782
Yeah, I'm good, babe.
I'm good.

20:41.673 --> 20:42.873
Damn it.

20:48.447 --> 20:49.847
Are you sure you don't
want any help?

20:49.849 --> 20:51.015
I got it.

20:52.251 --> 20:53.484
There's instructions.

20:53.486 --> 20:55.720
I am the tent wizard.

20:57.356 --> 20:58.956
Mm-hmm.

21:12.638 --> 21:14.038
It's ready.

21:29.288 --> 21:31.789
Charles: Arrggh!

21:31.791 --> 21:33.891
Charles: Gotcha!

21:33.893 --> 21:35.993
Stop it.

21:35.995 --> 21:38.663
Don't look at me.
Stop!

21:38.665 --> 21:40.765
I wanna see what I'll be
missing the next few days.

21:40.767 --> 21:42.433
I'll send you pictures.

21:42.435 --> 21:43.434
Dirty ones?

21:43.436 --> 21:44.502
Maybe.

22:01.820 --> 22:05.756
Dana: It's nice we're so
disconnected from cell phones.

22:05.758 --> 22:07.425
Disconnect to reconnect, right?

22:07.427 --> 22:08.726
I guess.

22:08.728 --> 22:10.628
It's a great name
for an album cover.

22:16.568 --> 22:17.735
I love this.

22:18.970 --> 22:21.372
I think you need it
more than I do, though.

22:21.374 --> 22:22.840
I have a great sense
of direction.

22:23.909 --> 22:26.577
Yeah, sure you do.

22:26.579 --> 22:29.914
Maybe we'll get lost together.

22:29.916 --> 22:31.982
Ah, you're safe with me.

22:31.984 --> 22:36.587
Unless a snake slithers into the tent.
Then you're on your own.

22:36.589 --> 22:38.889
What about a bear?

22:38.891 --> 22:40.925
I can handle a bear.

22:42.394 --> 22:44.061
Or you could beat up
a little bear.

22:44.063 --> 22:47.098
That's true. I could.

22:49.568 --> 22:53.738
You know, nothing's
getting into this tent.

22:55.140 --> 22:57.575
Unless it's my snake
ready for round two.

23:00.779 --> 23:02.480
You dork!

23:02.482 --> 23:05.449
Oh, god, stop, go to sleep!
I don't feel well, babe.

23:05.451 --> 23:06.617
Oh!

23:10.889 --> 23:12.156
Sweet dreams.

23:12.158 --> 23:14.058
I love you.

23:15.427 --> 23:16.994
Good night.

23:16.996 --> 23:18.162
Good night.

23:20.799 --> 23:22.400
Love you.

24:00.872 --> 24:02.072
Hey.

24:03.775 --> 24:05.943
Hey, Charles.

24:05.945 --> 24:07.044
What is that?

24:07.046 --> 24:08.679
It's your thumb.

24:08.681 --> 24:10.881
It's not my thumb,
I'm a professional.

24:10.883 --> 24:13.684
Charles: Go to sleep.

26:00.859 --> 26:02.293
Dana!

26:09.034 --> 26:10.234
Dana?

26:15.173 --> 26:16.273
Dana?

26:16.275 --> 26:17.975
One minute!

26:42.133 --> 26:44.835
The neighbors were
horrible last night.

26:44.837 --> 26:46.770
I guess I didn't hear 'em.

26:46.772 --> 26:49.206
Too many years next to
a bass and drum man.

26:50.976 --> 26:54.345
Never understood why people
shoot guns into the air.

26:54.347 --> 26:58.315
It's like, "look at me,
I'm so masculine."

27:00.018 --> 27:01.986
Assholes.

27:01.988 --> 27:04.288
Come on, let's go deeper in.

27:06.925 --> 27:09.393
Wanna go deeper in?

27:13.231 --> 27:14.732
Wait up!

27:27.278 --> 27:28.846
It's peaceful up here.

27:28.848 --> 27:32.349
May just come out here
on my own.

27:35.186 --> 27:37.921
That's why I keep telling
you to make friends.

27:46.798 --> 27:48.699
No, thank you.

27:48.701 --> 27:51.101
I thought you liked
marshmallows.

27:51.103 --> 27:52.936
You packed 'em.

27:55.707 --> 27:57.741
You know what this
reminds me of?

27:57.743 --> 27:59.376
What?

28:01.179 --> 28:03.180
Our first night out here.

28:09.220 --> 28:11.689
When I convinced you
to marry me?

28:17.162 --> 28:19.163
Oh, smoke.

28:24.369 --> 28:27.871
You know, you could stay
if you wanted.

28:27.873 --> 28:30.240
John would take you back.
You're a great paramedic.

28:30.242 --> 28:32.810
Look, I'm not changing
my mind, ok?

28:32.812 --> 28:35.779
Something I've always wanted
to do, just go on tour.

28:36.915 --> 28:39.717
You're not taking that
away from me.

28:42.854 --> 28:46.123
I get it, you're right.
I'm sorry I brought it up.

28:46.125 --> 28:48.926
Charles: Do you have to be
such a fucking buzz kill?

29:22.927 --> 29:24.194
Dana: Hello?

30:45.877 --> 30:47.177
What the hell is that?

30:50.115 --> 30:52.115
Assholes!

30:52.117 --> 30:53.383
Hey!

30:53.385 --> 30:55.552
Charles, don't.
Just leave it alone.

31:01.292 --> 31:03.093
Charles: Probably locals.

31:03.095 --> 31:06.029
They have a campfire
about 200 yards away.

31:06.031 --> 31:07.197
How many of them?

31:07.199 --> 31:08.599
Ten or so.

31:12.438 --> 31:14.071
They like their gunfire
and booze.

31:14.073 --> 31:15.906
Hey, great combination.

31:20.512 --> 31:21.645
I'm gonna kill 'em!

31:21.647 --> 31:23.413
Assholes!
They're crazy.

31:23.415 --> 31:25.182
Charles, you brought a gun?

31:25.184 --> 31:28.452
I'm not gonna let 'em go
all crazy redneck on our ass.

31:28.454 --> 31:30.988
- Dana: Charles, are you crazy?
- Charles: Goddamn it!

31:32.491 --> 31:34.157
What is that?

31:53.646 --> 31:55.612
What is that?

32:02.521 --> 32:04.187
What is that?

32:06.025 --> 32:07.524
I don't know.

32:35.988 --> 32:38.121
Dana: Oh, shit! What the fuck!

32:38.123 --> 32:39.289
Charles: Shh!

32:39.291 --> 32:41.325
Help me!

32:43.361 --> 32:45.495
Help me!

32:45.497 --> 32:47.164
Charles, what are you doing?

32:47.166 --> 32:48.532
We can't just leave him
out there.

32:48.534 --> 32:49.566
Yes, we can!

32:49.568 --> 32:51.601
He's close.
Are you crazy?

32:51.603 --> 32:52.736
I'm gonna go with you.

32:52.738 --> 32:54.638
No, I'll be right back.

32:54.640 --> 32:56.540
Charles, you're crazy.

32:57.976 --> 32:59.543
Charles!

32:59.545 --> 33:01.111
Charles!

33:02.280 --> 33:03.981
Fuck!

33:06.317 --> 33:07.517
Shit.

33:18.530 --> 33:20.230
Shit.

33:22.700 --> 33:25.035
Stop fucking with me!

33:29.475 --> 33:31.375
Oh, shit.

33:31.377 --> 33:32.776
Hello?

33:45.157 --> 33:46.757
Dana: Charles?

33:54.399 --> 33:56.033
Charles.

33:56.035 --> 33:58.368
Charles?

33:58.370 --> 34:00.437
Charles?

34:00.439 --> 34:01.605
Charles?

34:07.413 --> 34:09.780
Dana: Shh!
You're gonna be ok. Shh!

34:09.782 --> 34:11.415
Keep him still.

34:14.219 --> 34:16.186
It's ok, it's ok.

34:18.357 --> 34:19.489
Hold him down!

34:19.491 --> 34:20.657
I'm trying!

34:23.261 --> 34:26.830
I can't stop the bleeding.
Whatever it takes, ok?

34:32.103 --> 34:34.137
Uggh! Fuck! Fuck!

34:34.139 --> 34:35.772
That hurt.

34:39.811 --> 34:44.147
Hold him right here.

34:44.149 --> 34:46.583
I mean...

34:46.585 --> 34:48.618
You think it could be
like a black bear?

34:49.853 --> 34:52.389
They're normally not
that aggressive.

34:52.391 --> 34:54.091
I just... I wonder.

34:56.527 --> 34:59.830
I don't know.
That's tight enough.

35:13.878 --> 35:15.579
What the...?

35:15.581 --> 35:16.680
What is it?

35:20.651 --> 35:21.685
Is it a claw?

35:24.555 --> 35:26.723
Looks like a fingernail.

35:33.364 --> 35:35.799
We just need to get out of here.

35:35.801 --> 35:37.234
We can't save him.

35:37.236 --> 35:39.136
Ok? Look at him.

35:39.138 --> 35:42.405
He's getting worse, but we do
need to get him out of here.

35:42.407 --> 35:44.674
We need to get us out of here.

35:44.676 --> 35:48.478
One of those four-wheelers
might be our only way.

35:48.480 --> 35:51.548
Good, let's...
Go get on one now.

35:51.550 --> 35:53.783
The trick is not injuring him
more on the way back down.

35:53.785 --> 35:57.320
Look, look, maybe we can
just go and get help back.

35:57.322 --> 35:59.189
Ok?

35:59.191 --> 36:02.225
The ranger station's not far.

36:24.782 --> 36:26.683
Ok. It's ok.

36:42.700 --> 36:43.900
That thing is gone.

36:46.871 --> 36:48.939
Don't even start.

36:48.941 --> 36:51.608
I don't need to be right, ok?
I just...

36:51.610 --> 36:54.978
I think we need
to get out of here.

37:00.452 --> 37:02.953
- Dana: Charles. Look.
- Charles: What?

37:04.455 --> 37:06.990
- You have an open fracture.

37:06.992 --> 37:09.893
Movement of the broken bone
will increase pain.

37:09.895 --> 37:11.495
Listen to me, you've lost
a lot of blood.

37:14.299 --> 37:15.765
Dana, whispering:
Please! Please be quiet.

37:15.767 --> 37:18.868
Hey! Sorry. Listen to me.
I know you're in pain

37:18.870 --> 37:21.304
but you really need
to be quiet for me.

37:25.509 --> 37:28.845
- Relax, we're gonna help you.
- Man: We gotta get out of here.

37:28.847 --> 37:30.447
I know.

37:30.449 --> 37:32.349
Charles: What's your name?

37:32.351 --> 37:34.951
Sean. Sean Ramsey.

37:34.953 --> 37:38.555
Charles: My name is Charles,
and this is my wife, Dana.

37:38.557 --> 37:40.557
I need you to take these.

37:43.728 --> 37:47.497
They're gonna help
with the pain.

37:47.499 --> 37:49.633
It's the strongest thing I got.

37:51.469 --> 37:53.503
Dana: I'd take 'em
if I were you.

37:53.505 --> 37:55.639
You're lucky he's a paramedic.

38:05.416 --> 38:07.484
Charles:
Now, tell us what happened.

38:07.486 --> 38:08.752
What attacked you?

38:08.754 --> 38:11.521
We can't be here.

38:13.057 --> 38:15.859
Charles: Just...
Tell us what happened.

38:21.565 --> 38:24.701
A week or so ago...

38:24.703 --> 38:28.471
My brother and some them boys
were coming up...

38:28.473 --> 38:31.608
They come up here, just hunting.

38:33.577 --> 38:37.380
I was supposed to be
with 'em, but I wasn't.

38:37.382 --> 38:39.449
Anyway...

38:39.451 --> 38:40.984
After about a week,

38:40.986 --> 38:43.353
we started thinking
maybe they...

38:43.355 --> 38:46.022
Stayed to hunt
for another few days.

38:46.024 --> 38:49.793
Then a week turned into two...

38:49.795 --> 38:51.828
We started worrying about 'em.

38:51.830 --> 38:53.663
Then, uh...

38:57.368 --> 39:01.604
Then they found my boy Kevin...

39:01.606 --> 39:05.642
He was stumbling down
the middle of the street.

39:05.644 --> 39:09.045
He'd been attacked...

39:09.047 --> 39:11.781
Something attacked him.

39:11.783 --> 39:15.452
He couldn't talk,
he was so scared.

39:18.689 --> 39:20.857
Charles:
Then what happened?

39:20.859 --> 39:22.726
What about your brother?

39:27.498 --> 39:29.432
He never came back.

39:29.434 --> 39:33.069
Kevin said he got attacked
by whatever it was.

39:33.071 --> 39:36.005
The folks around town...

39:36.007 --> 39:39.476
Started saying that
it was Kevin.

39:41.078 --> 39:43.713
I knew better.

39:43.715 --> 39:47.817
We came up here and we thought
we'd get retribution.

39:47.819 --> 39:50.120
Get some payback on whatever
the hell it was

39:50.122 --> 39:51.921
that did that to him.

39:51.923 --> 39:53.623
It was a stupid idea.

39:53.625 --> 39:55.091
Sounded more like a party.

39:55.093 --> 39:56.826
Charles.

39:56.828 --> 39:58.161
We were blowing off some steam.

39:59.864 --> 40:01.598
Oh...

40:03.434 --> 40:05.668
What happened to your brother?

40:14.812 --> 40:17.781
Oh, can I get some more
of that water?

40:23.488 --> 40:26.623
What was that?
Did you hear something?

40:26.625 --> 40:30.126
I heard something.
Is it out there?

40:43.007 --> 40:44.841
Oh!

40:44.843 --> 40:48.011
Charles: We can wait till
morning, get him out of here.

40:48.013 --> 40:50.480
Dana: I think we should make
a run for it now.

40:50.482 --> 40:52.982
That's it, that's your plan?

40:52.984 --> 40:55.618
Charles:
You got a better one?

40:55.620 --> 40:58.021
Yeah, go ahead and shoot me now!

41:04.061 --> 41:05.929
It's the best plan I got.

41:39.631 --> 41:41.698
Just stop humming, ok?

41:44.134 --> 41:45.668
Sorry.

41:45.670 --> 41:50.039
Been doing it since I was
a little kid.

41:50.041 --> 41:53.610
I might as well die
with a sweet tune in my mind.

41:53.612 --> 41:55.645
You're not gonna die.

41:59.517 --> 42:01.618
Brother hated it, too.

42:19.204 --> 42:20.770
Don't move.

42:24.775 --> 42:26.609
It's a bear.

42:26.611 --> 42:27.744
Just kill us, already.

42:27.746 --> 42:29.212
Shut up!

42:43.628 --> 42:48.197
Sean: Know how to use that?
You're better off letting me.

42:48.199 --> 42:50.333
I know how to use a firearm.

42:59.009 --> 43:00.843
Dana: Did you hit it?

43:00.845 --> 43:02.679
I don't know.

43:02.681 --> 43:05.715
Might as well save your bullets.

43:17.095 --> 43:18.962
Baby, turn the light off!

43:26.104 --> 43:28.838
Oh, my god!

43:28.840 --> 43:33.276
Big bad wolf.

43:35.779 --> 43:38.047
Did you see that?

43:42.152 --> 43:45.154
It saved us.

43:45.156 --> 43:47.323
Sean: No...

43:47.325 --> 43:50.226
It's just more patient
than a bear.

43:52.096 --> 43:56.299
You oughta save some
of them for better use.

43:56.301 --> 43:58.401
What do you mean, better use?

43:58.403 --> 44:00.169
Turn the light off.

44:02.039 --> 44:04.874
Sean: I mean...

44:04.876 --> 44:06.809
Save one bullet for each of us.

44:08.178 --> 44:10.413
In case we don't make it
till the morning.

44:12.883 --> 44:15.918
You think we'll be safer
when we get to daylight?

44:17.989 --> 44:19.856
No.

44:19.858 --> 44:22.759
It's just easier to run from it

44:22.761 --> 44:24.961
when you can see it
comin' at ya.

44:26.397 --> 44:28.798
Whatever it takes,
we'll beat it.

44:28.800 --> 44:30.967
Whatever it takes.

44:30.969 --> 44:33.169
Whatever it takes.

44:35.407 --> 44:38.241
I'm sorry.

44:38.243 --> 44:40.943
But you don't have
what it takes.

44:43.714 --> 44:45.948
Nobody does.

45:30.761 --> 45:32.195
What are you smiling about?

45:34.765 --> 45:36.833
Nothin'.

45:48.278 --> 45:50.413
Think that thing wants
to finish you off.

45:53.083 --> 45:54.917
Yeah, you're probably right.

45:57.321 --> 45:59.889
Could have ripped this tent
to shreds and it didn't.

45:59.891 --> 46:01.390
Maybe it's scared.

46:01.392 --> 46:03.459
Sean: It's just messing with us.

46:05.163 --> 46:06.796
Quiet.

46:08.999 --> 46:10.399
Like a cat.

46:10.401 --> 46:12.435
A cat messing with a little bug.

46:12.437 --> 46:14.537
Can you please just stop?

46:14.539 --> 46:16.539
He's just waiting to see
what our next move is.

46:18.777 --> 46:19.842
So...

46:21.178 --> 46:23.279
What...

46:23.281 --> 46:26.382
Are we gonna do next?

46:35.226 --> 46:40.096
We're gonna just
wait till the morning.

46:40.098 --> 46:42.899
Get one of those
four-wheelers out there.

46:44.335 --> 46:46.135
God, good luck with that.

46:46.137 --> 46:47.170
Are any drivable?

46:47.172 --> 46:49.071
Maybe.

46:49.073 --> 46:52.542
- Charles, scoffing: Maybe?
- I don't know.

46:52.544 --> 46:58.114
Do you think one of them
can still drive?

46:58.116 --> 47:01.350
Four-Wheeler can only carry
two people.

47:01.352 --> 47:04.020
So, what's your plan? Huh?

47:05.222 --> 47:07.957
You gonna take off
and leave me here, huh?

47:09.227 --> 47:10.560
I can do it.

47:10.562 --> 47:12.962
You're gonna run halfway
to those four-wheelers,

47:12.964 --> 47:16.132
and that thing
is gonna tear you in half.

47:20.437 --> 47:23.539
Hey. Do you have
any more of those pills?

47:23.541 --> 47:25.374
Charles: We need to save some.

47:25.376 --> 47:28.144
Sean: Can I bum a smoke?

47:28.146 --> 47:29.378
A cigarette?

47:29.380 --> 47:31.347
Yeah.

47:31.349 --> 47:33.249
They calm my nerves.

47:34.284 --> 47:35.451
We don't smoke.

47:35.453 --> 47:39.422
Do you guys have anything
to eat?

47:45.596 --> 47:48.030
Chocolate or strawberry?

47:48.032 --> 47:50.099
Oh, oh.

47:50.101 --> 47:53.002
I'll take chocolate.

47:53.004 --> 47:54.604
Oh, no, no, wait, wait.
Strawberry.

47:58.308 --> 48:00.409
Ha ha!

48:00.411 --> 48:02.645
What are you guys,
like health nuts or something?

48:02.647 --> 48:04.580
Yeah, something like that.

48:04.582 --> 48:06.482
Sean: Healthy.

48:08.018 --> 48:11.454
So, what brings you
up to the woods?

48:11.456 --> 48:13.990
We might as well get
to know each other.

48:18.295 --> 48:20.296
It's our anniversary.

48:20.298 --> 48:21.631
No shit, huh?

48:21.633 --> 48:25.201
Come out to the wilds
to get wild.

48:27.305 --> 48:28.905
Answering the call of nature.

48:28.907 --> 48:32.108
Jesus Christ.
God, you're a charmer.

48:32.110 --> 48:34.243
Sex is natural.

48:34.245 --> 48:39.248
Actually, this is...
Where I proposed to Dana.

48:39.250 --> 48:42.418
No kidding?

48:42.420 --> 48:44.487
Romantic.

48:44.489 --> 48:48.557
Not a lot of romantic guys
walking around these days.

48:48.559 --> 48:50.293
You know.

48:50.295 --> 48:53.329
Never a dull moment
with this guy.

48:56.466 --> 48:59.268
Me and my wife...

48:59.270 --> 49:02.571
My ex-wife...

49:02.573 --> 49:04.607
Uh...

49:04.609 --> 49:07.209
We never did anything romantic.

49:10.480 --> 49:14.450
You got yourself one hell
of a decent guy there.

49:14.452 --> 49:16.285
I know.

49:19.556 --> 49:21.090
You ok?

49:28.665 --> 49:30.132
You can sleep.

49:30.134 --> 49:31.567
Yeah.

49:39.376 --> 49:40.643
You take it.

49:45.549 --> 49:48.684
Dana: Just relax.
It will soon be morning.

49:59.730 --> 50:01.330
I'm sorry.

50:42.039 --> 50:43.672
"Nails," huh?

50:47.577 --> 50:49.211
It's a stupid nickname.

50:50.380 --> 50:51.480
Tough as...

50:51.482 --> 50:54.383
Oh. Tough as nails.

50:56.219 --> 50:59.155
I suppose I owe you
a thank-you.

51:01.258 --> 51:04.093
You shouldn't thank me,
you should thank my husband.

51:04.095 --> 51:06.062
I was fine leaving a man behind.

51:06.064 --> 51:09.065
Sean: Yeah,
he could have left me

51:09.067 --> 51:11.333
out there to die, but he didn't.

51:11.335 --> 51:14.303
He tries to do the right thing.

51:14.305 --> 51:16.272
You, not so much.

51:19.109 --> 51:22.244
He complained about
my singing, but...

51:24.381 --> 51:28.751
I'm guessing you think
it's adorable.

51:28.753 --> 51:30.386
Right?

51:34.324 --> 51:35.524
Sure.

51:38.728 --> 51:41.564
How long have you two
been married?

51:55.745 --> 51:56.879
Two years.

51:56.881 --> 51:58.347
That's not very long.

52:00.250 --> 52:02.718
No. We've been through
a lot, though.

52:02.720 --> 52:06.122
That's about how long
my wife and I made it.

52:08.592 --> 52:10.726
Look here. See that?

52:12.696 --> 52:15.431
Right there,
she got a matching one.

52:17.667 --> 52:19.768
Think hers might have been
a little deeper.

52:21.338 --> 52:23.139
Marriage is complicated.

52:23.141 --> 52:24.206
Yeah.

52:26.510 --> 52:27.710
Well...

52:28.845 --> 52:30.846
Mine was kind of simple, really.

52:30.848 --> 52:33.582
She left me and took
my daughter with her.

52:33.584 --> 52:35.651
Should have seen that coming.

52:38.522 --> 52:39.655
Yeah.

52:44.828 --> 52:46.462
You remind me of her.

52:48.765 --> 52:50.499
Your wife?

52:50.501 --> 52:52.902
My ex.

52:52.904 --> 52:54.637
You're very pretty.

52:58.842 --> 53:00.309
You have the same...

53:02.712 --> 53:05.247
Blue eyes.

53:08.485 --> 53:10.586
Wanna see a picture of her?

53:10.588 --> 53:13.722
I got one in my wallet.

53:13.724 --> 53:15.958
Help me out. It's...

53:15.960 --> 53:19.495
My arm isn't working
all that good, really.

53:19.497 --> 53:21.864
Could you just give me a hand?

53:21.866 --> 53:24.200
Take a look at her.

53:25.468 --> 53:27.469
I won't bite.

53:34.411 --> 53:36.645
She's pretty.

53:36.647 --> 53:37.846
Yeah.

53:40.383 --> 53:43.252
You must still like her if you're
carrying around her picture,

53:43.254 --> 53:44.420
wearing the ring.

53:44.422 --> 53:45.888
Yeah.

53:45.890 --> 53:47.723
Well, you know...

53:48.792 --> 53:50.392
How old's your kid?

53:52.629 --> 53:54.230
Nine.

53:56.233 --> 53:57.366
You ever see her?

54:01.638 --> 54:03.505
They need a dad, right?

54:03.507 --> 54:05.341
I mean...

54:05.343 --> 54:08.510
They're supposed
to have a daddy.

54:08.512 --> 54:10.913
Even if it's
a shitty one, you know?

54:18.421 --> 54:20.489
Do you have any kids?

54:21.791 --> 54:23.425
No. What are you doing?

54:24.561 --> 54:27.363
Can't blame a guy
for trying, right?

54:27.365 --> 54:28.564
Yes, you can.

54:34.804 --> 54:36.839
Man: Help me!

54:40.343 --> 54:42.378
Charles: One of your buddies.

54:42.380 --> 54:43.812
Sean:
Describe him to me.

54:43.814 --> 54:45.981
Charles: Dressed like you.
He has a beard.

54:48.485 --> 54:50.052
Oh, that's Howard.

54:58.962 --> 55:01.664
- Howard: Help me!
- Charles: We have to get him.

55:01.666 --> 55:03.666
Please wait!

55:03.668 --> 55:05.868
Howard!
Howard, we're coming for you!

55:10.474 --> 55:12.741
Howard: Help!

55:12.743 --> 55:16.445
Is it setting a trap?

55:16.447 --> 55:18.747
Howard, hang on, buddy!

55:26.991 --> 55:28.023
Howard!

56:22.645 --> 56:23.879
Well...

56:25.882 --> 56:27.549
Howard was pretty high
all the time

56:27.551 --> 56:29.885
so he probably didn't feel much.

56:29.887 --> 56:32.621
Sounds like he felt everything.

56:33.590 --> 56:35.591
Yeah, meth makes you fearless.

56:37.427 --> 56:38.827
Right.

56:39.963 --> 56:41.096
Fearless.

56:52.509 --> 56:54.643
What do you know about it?

56:59.149 --> 57:00.849
Tell me what you know about it.

57:04.187 --> 57:07.022
I know you know something.

57:07.024 --> 57:08.924
Why hasn't it attacked us?

57:08.926 --> 57:11.693
Is it afraid of something?

57:11.695 --> 57:15.063
Why is it waiting?
What the hell is it?

57:20.904 --> 57:23.839
I guess you could say
I've heard about it.

57:23.841 --> 57:26.074
My whole life growing up,

57:26.076 --> 57:30.446
I heard tales
about what happened out here.

57:35.084 --> 57:37.686
People not coming back.

57:37.688 --> 57:41.690
My friends all thought
they were bullshit stories

57:41.692 --> 57:44.660
just to keep us fools
from wandering off, but...

57:46.029 --> 57:48.096
I had a crazy grandma, Millie.

57:49.599 --> 57:52.468
Millie ray.

57:52.470 --> 57:55.571
She used to tell
some crazy stories.

57:55.573 --> 57:57.773
All kinds of crazy stories.

58:00.877 --> 58:03.679
She said she knew the truth.

58:03.681 --> 58:08.750
The truth about what happened
out here hundreds of years ago.

58:08.752 --> 58:11.820
Before everything went white.

58:13.089 --> 58:14.990
I believed her.

58:17.760 --> 58:21.730
I mean, I was a kid.
I believed anything, but...

58:21.732 --> 58:25.701
She told me a story
about a gullah woman.

58:25.703 --> 58:29.972
These warriors went and captured
a teenage girl

58:29.974 --> 58:32.140
from a rival village.

58:32.142 --> 58:35.544
Course, she had to be beautiful.

58:36.913 --> 58:39.147
But the young thing,
before she knew it,

58:39.149 --> 58:41.583
was tied up to a...

58:41.585 --> 58:45.988
Wooden frame stuck
in a bear den.

58:47.690 --> 58:50.626
See, there was a drought.

58:53.596 --> 58:59.134
The sacrifice was to cause
as much blood as possible

58:59.136 --> 59:02.771
to rain down upon the earth
and fertilize it.

59:08.211 --> 59:10.946
But this girl was pregnant.

59:12.315 --> 59:15.851
She survived long enough
to deliver the baby.

59:17.754 --> 59:21.590
But she didn't last very long
in that bear den.

59:26.229 --> 59:31.633
And a few years later,
some women from that tribe,

59:31.635 --> 59:36.038
some pregnant women...
Disappeared.

59:36.040 --> 59:39.741
Legend has it that anyone
who goes out there

59:39.743 --> 59:45.113
and tries to find them
doesn't come back.

59:47.817 --> 59:51.687
Grandma Millie says her spirit
still lives out here

59:51.689 --> 59:56.858
and it still happens
to this day.

01:00:00.597 --> 01:00:03.799
I know it sounds pretty crazy.

01:00:03.801 --> 01:00:08.303
I mean, grandma Millie
was pretty nuts.

01:00:08.305 --> 01:00:11.006
She convinced the taxidermist
to stuff grandpa.

01:00:11.008 --> 01:00:13.942
Now, he sits
in the la-z-boy chair

01:00:13.944 --> 01:00:17.079
watching reruns of <i> jeopardy!</i>
With her all the time.

01:00:19.882 --> 01:00:21.216
I don't know.

01:00:24.887 --> 01:00:26.888
So here we are.

01:00:29.125 --> 01:00:30.726
Here we are.

01:01:27.850 --> 01:01:28.917
Hey.

01:01:30.353 --> 01:01:31.853
Hey.

01:01:34.057 --> 01:01:39.428
Can you... Scratch my back?
I got an itch in my back.

01:01:39.430 --> 01:01:42.064
Can you scratch it?
I can't reach it.

01:01:42.066 --> 01:01:43.799
Right in the middle.

01:01:46.703 --> 01:01:51.373
No, come up, get closer.
Yeah, there you go.

01:01:52.843 --> 01:01:55.143
Not so hard. Yeah.

01:01:58.281 --> 01:02:00.982
The book is not mine.

01:02:00.984 --> 01:02:03.919
It's not your book.

01:02:03.921 --> 01:02:06.154
And I suppose
those horse pills aren't...

01:02:06.156 --> 01:02:07.489
Mind your own business, ok?

01:02:10.059 --> 01:02:11.460
So, does he...

01:02:11.462 --> 01:02:12.761
Please.

01:02:19.969 --> 01:02:22.070
Stop hitting on my wife.

01:02:24.006 --> 01:02:26.241
Thank you.

01:02:27.911 --> 01:02:30.412
It's all good.
We were just talking.

01:02:30.414 --> 01:02:33.882
Just having a little
conversation about life.

01:02:36.252 --> 01:02:39.187
Oh, nails, you're gonna
make a great...

01:02:39.189 --> 01:02:42.357
oh, wife.

01:02:45.495 --> 01:02:48.063
You're a lucky man, Charles,

01:02:48.065 --> 01:02:53.301
to have such an honest,
compassionate woman.

01:02:55.071 --> 01:02:57.139
Much better than mine.

01:02:59.408 --> 01:03:01.042
Rare.

01:03:03.379 --> 01:03:05.814
Very rare.

01:03:09.852 --> 01:03:11.453
Hey!

01:03:23.432 --> 01:03:26.968
- No one's trying to be a hero!
- Dana: Are you insane?

01:03:26.970 --> 01:03:28.870
No. I'm just gettin'
out of here.

01:03:28.872 --> 01:03:31.306
You son of a bitch,
we saved your life.

01:03:31.308 --> 01:03:34.843
No, he saved my life, remember?

01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:37.379
Come on.

01:03:37.381 --> 01:03:39.881
What do you mean?

01:03:39.883 --> 01:03:42.184
You think the tent is
some magical safe zone?

01:03:42.186 --> 01:03:45.487
No. You're my ticket
out of here.

01:03:45.489 --> 01:03:47.289
What?

01:03:47.291 --> 01:03:50.458
That thing's not attacking
us because it knows...

01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:52.594
What are you talking about?

01:03:52.596 --> 01:03:54.963
It's not the tent, you idiot.

01:03:54.965 --> 01:03:57.065
The thing knows you're pregnant.

01:03:57.067 --> 01:03:59.868
She's not fuckin' pregnant!

01:04:05.108 --> 01:04:06.108
Are you?

01:04:10.246 --> 01:04:12.047
Charles: Are you?

01:04:14.050 --> 01:04:16.418
I'm sorry, baby,
i was gonna tell you.

01:04:18.521 --> 01:04:20.455
I knew you didn't want it and...

01:04:22.892 --> 01:04:24.459
Fuck.

01:04:24.461 --> 01:04:26.027
Ok, good.

01:04:26.029 --> 01:04:27.495
Now that everything's
out in the open...

01:04:27.497 --> 01:04:29.231
You asshole.

01:04:29.233 --> 01:04:31.099
We'll send somebody
back for him,

01:04:31.101 --> 01:04:34.169
but right now, you're my
ticket to ride, mama.

01:04:34.171 --> 01:04:38.039
Ok, look, I'll come with you,
but Charles has to come.

01:04:38.041 --> 01:04:39.474
He can fit on the back.

01:04:39.476 --> 01:04:41.443
He's only gonna slow us down.

01:04:41.445 --> 01:04:43.245
Please! There's
safety in numbers.

01:04:43.247 --> 01:04:45.380
Do you want me
to shoot him right now?

01:04:45.382 --> 01:04:46.982
Ok!

01:04:48.918 --> 01:04:50.919
Good choice.

01:04:56.660 --> 01:04:59.060
Nails...

01:04:59.062 --> 01:05:00.462
Sean:
Get going.

01:05:08.070 --> 01:05:10.171
Sean: Ow!

01:05:14.678 --> 01:05:16.278
Dana: What do you
wanna do?

01:05:18.315 --> 01:05:20.215
Dana: What do you
want to do?

01:05:20.217 --> 01:05:22.384
We're gonna tie him up.

01:05:24.186 --> 01:05:25.287
Outside.

01:05:27.123 --> 01:05:28.690
We're gonna use him as bait.

01:05:34.464 --> 01:05:38.333
I'd be quiet if I were you.

01:05:38.335 --> 01:05:42.370
You don't have
to do this, you know.

01:05:42.372 --> 01:05:44.306
You left me no choice.

01:05:44.308 --> 01:05:46.141
You always have a choice.

01:06:13.035 --> 01:06:15.403
Why didn't you tell me?

01:06:19.342 --> 01:06:21.643
We're not those people, right?

01:06:21.645 --> 01:06:24.346
You made it very clear.

01:06:24.348 --> 01:06:26.414
Just wasn't in the cards for us.

01:06:26.416 --> 01:06:28.350
We're the cool ones, right?

01:06:28.352 --> 01:06:30.685
So, you were just never
going to say anything?

01:06:30.687 --> 01:06:32.654
I didn't know, Charles.

01:06:32.656 --> 01:06:34.122
Dana.

01:06:37.426 --> 01:06:39.494
You know, I'm having it.

01:06:43.566 --> 01:06:45.400
We can get out of here.

01:06:48.037 --> 01:06:50.205
If you can just get to it.

01:06:52.608 --> 01:06:54.676
And him?

01:06:54.678 --> 01:06:58.046
That thing will have something
to chew on while you run for it.

01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:20.268
Oh, shit, Charles.

01:07:20.270 --> 01:07:22.370
Look.

01:07:32.715 --> 01:07:34.749
Good, now I don't
have to feel bad.

01:07:34.751 --> 01:07:36.584
You think he got...

01:07:36.586 --> 01:07:38.453
No, we would have heard it.

01:07:38.455 --> 01:07:41.756
He's on his own. Let him
protect himself out there.

01:07:41.758 --> 01:07:44.159
You think he's gonna
come back for us?

01:07:44.161 --> 01:07:47.429
He won't last long
in his condition.

01:07:47.431 --> 01:07:49.798
Neither will I.

01:08:10.152 --> 01:08:11.352
Oh, shit.

01:08:18.194 --> 01:08:19.461
I'm gonna do it.

01:08:19.462 --> 01:08:20.828
I can't let you do this.

01:08:20.831 --> 01:08:22.162
I have to try.

01:08:22.165 --> 01:08:23.598
We're no good to him.

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:25.567
That thing's staying
away from us.

01:08:25.569 --> 01:08:26.768
We gotta try, baby.

01:08:26.770 --> 01:08:28.470
I won't let you do this.

01:08:30.206 --> 01:08:32.740
Baby, we have no choice.

01:10:08.704 --> 01:10:09.804
Come on!

01:10:17.813 --> 01:10:18.813
Come on.

01:11:25.981 --> 01:11:33.981
Ahh!

01:11:36.293 --> 01:11:44.293
Ahh!

01:12:13.429 --> 01:12:15.063
Sean may still be out there.

01:12:17.366 --> 01:12:18.933
Get to the four-Wheeler.

01:12:24.441 --> 01:12:25.740
Go!

01:13:06.782 --> 01:13:08.049
Come on!

01:13:38.113 --> 01:13:39.914
Goddamn it!

01:13:44.553 --> 01:13:46.187
Ohh!

01:14:10.013 --> 01:14:12.180
Dana!

01:14:12.182 --> 01:14:14.582
No!

01:14:15.818 --> 01:14:17.518
Please!

01:14:22.624 --> 01:14:24.725
Dana!

01:14:26.463 --> 01:14:27.895
Run!

01:14:31.467 --> 01:14:33.000
Dana! Run!

01:14:49.117 --> 01:14:50.184
You're...

01:14:50.186 --> 01:14:51.252
Oh, my god.

01:14:53.555 --> 01:14:54.689
What the fuck.

01:14:57.025 --> 01:14:58.559
Dana, gasping: Oh, god!

01:14:58.561 --> 01:15:01.062
I think something happened
when it touched me.

01:15:03.031 --> 01:15:04.131
Are you ok?

01:15:04.133 --> 01:15:05.500
No, I'm not ok!

01:15:07.003 --> 01:15:08.536
Baby!

01:15:11.173 --> 01:15:12.640
We need to get out of here.

01:15:12.642 --> 01:15:14.942
Yeah, we will...
Can we get out?

01:15:16.011 --> 01:15:18.212
I don't know.
It was stuck in the dirt.

01:15:18.214 --> 01:15:20.915
I think we need
two people to move it.

01:15:20.917 --> 01:15:22.583
My leg and...

01:15:22.585 --> 01:15:24.218
Your...

01:15:24.220 --> 01:15:26.153
You mean our baby.

01:15:37.699 --> 01:15:39.267
Your hand.

01:15:41.203 --> 01:15:43.304
Oh, my god.

01:15:44.706 --> 01:15:46.974
Oh, baby.

01:15:46.976 --> 01:15:48.609
What's happening to me?

01:15:59.989 --> 01:16:02.290
Oh, god! Fuck!

01:16:02.292 --> 01:16:03.991
Aaah!

01:16:23.145 --> 01:16:24.879
Oh.

01:16:24.881 --> 01:16:26.981
I'm so sorry.

01:16:33.155 --> 01:16:35.222
I could be a good dad.

01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:39.794
I could.

01:16:42.097 --> 01:16:45.900
I'd figure out the whole
dad thing, you know?

01:16:45.902 --> 01:16:48.603
Charles, please.

01:16:50.205 --> 01:16:53.841
We're gonna get out of here.

01:16:53.843 --> 01:16:56.143
Together.

01:16:59.081 --> 01:17:00.348
Sean: Peekaboo.

01:17:02.619 --> 01:17:06.087
Sorry. I hate to interrupt
a touching family moment.

01:17:06.089 --> 01:17:09.023
But I need my ticket
out of here.

01:17:12.728 --> 01:17:14.962
What the fuck?

01:17:14.964 --> 01:17:16.397
Hey! Easy there, daddy.

01:17:16.399 --> 01:17:19.867
We just wanna get out
of here alive, ok?

01:17:21.837 --> 01:17:24.271
Come on, let's go
before it's too late.

01:17:24.273 --> 01:17:26.774
Too late for what?

01:17:26.776 --> 01:17:29.677
I think you know what, honey.

01:17:33.315 --> 01:17:35.249
So let's go!

01:17:37.387 --> 01:17:39.820
It wasn't a search party
for your brother,

01:17:39.822 --> 01:17:41.822
that was for your wife.

01:17:41.824 --> 01:17:44.291
One of those things
was wearing that ring.

01:17:44.293 --> 01:17:46.861
Ah, so you met my old lady, huh?

01:17:46.863 --> 01:17:48.329
What the fuck are you
talking about?

01:17:48.331 --> 01:17:51.766
I bet she looked pretty pissed,
huh?

01:17:51.768 --> 01:17:53.801
What happened to her?

01:17:58.206 --> 01:18:01.142
She started hearing voices.

01:18:01.144 --> 01:18:03.277
In her head.

01:18:03.279 --> 01:18:05.413
Crazy voices.

01:18:05.415 --> 01:18:10.017
Something calling her
out to the woods.

01:18:10.019 --> 01:18:14.255
I called bullshit on it.
I told her to take care of it.

01:18:16.158 --> 01:18:18.159
Take care of what?

01:18:18.161 --> 01:18:20.261
The baby.
Jesus, wake the fuck up!

01:18:20.263 --> 01:18:22.763
Go ahead, tell Charles.

01:18:22.765 --> 01:18:26.734
You hearing the voices yet?
Hmm?

01:18:26.736 --> 01:18:30.838
Yeah. You didn't pick
this spot,

01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:33.841
your little romantic
honeymoon rendezvous.

01:18:33.843 --> 01:18:37.745
This spot picked you.

01:18:41.416 --> 01:18:43.851
I don't understand.

01:18:43.853 --> 01:18:45.920
Grandma Millie wasn't full
of shit after all, huh?

01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:52.159
Charles: Dana!

01:18:52.161 --> 01:18:53.761
Enough of this bullshit,
let's go.

01:18:53.763 --> 01:18:56.797
Hey! Hey, you!

01:18:56.799 --> 01:18:59.800
I was thinking about killing you
and throwing your body outside

01:18:59.802 --> 01:19:01.502
to use as a decoy,
but then I realized,

01:19:01.504 --> 01:19:03.404
all this time
you've been thinking

01:19:03.406 --> 01:19:05.239
it's you two against me.

01:19:05.241 --> 01:19:06.807
Yeah.

01:19:06.809 --> 01:19:11.312
Well, it's really you and me
against them.

01:19:11.314 --> 01:19:15.916
All them bitches out there,
they don't like me very much.

01:19:17.319 --> 01:19:20.121
Here.
You know what to do with that.

01:19:20.123 --> 01:19:25.292
Now, mama, you're gonna
escort me out of here.

01:19:25.294 --> 01:19:27.261
Now, let's go.

01:19:28.797 --> 01:19:29.930
Do it.

01:19:31.833 --> 01:19:33.467
Sean: That's right, good girl.

01:19:33.469 --> 01:19:37.872
When this whole night is over,
I'm gonna let you go,

01:19:37.874 --> 01:19:41.408
and we're just gonna pretend
this whole day never happened.

01:19:48.183 --> 01:19:49.216
No.

01:19:49.218 --> 01:19:52.153
No, no. No!

01:19:52.155 --> 01:19:53.487
No?

01:19:53.489 --> 01:19:54.955
No, you can take both of us.

01:19:54.957 --> 01:19:57.858
All three can fit
on the four-Wheeler.

01:19:57.860 --> 01:20:00.561
Just go with him. Save yourself.
No!

01:20:00.563 --> 01:20:04.999
Get up now or I'll shoot you
both, starting with him.

01:20:08.136 --> 01:20:09.303
Go.

01:20:09.305 --> 01:20:12.573
Good girl. There you go.

01:20:12.575 --> 01:20:14.308
Go.

01:20:17.479 --> 01:20:19.814
What are we doing?

01:20:19.816 --> 01:20:22.817
We're gonna go reclaim
what's mine.

01:20:26.489 --> 01:20:28.355
Sean: Help!

01:20:31.326 --> 01:20:32.560
Ow!

01:20:59.455 --> 01:21:00.621
Oh, my god!

01:21:37.392 --> 01:21:40.261
Looks like they want you
to finish me.

01:21:46.501 --> 01:21:50.537
I guess I'm your initiation.
Come on, nails.

01:21:50.539 --> 01:21:52.006
Don't call me nails.

01:22:15.363 --> 01:22:17.631
Come on!
Come on, nails!

01:22:17.633 --> 01:22:20.167
Don't call me that.

01:22:21.503 --> 01:22:23.470
Let's show 'em some action.

01:22:40.188 --> 01:22:41.422
No.

01:22:41.424 --> 01:22:43.023
Where is she?

01:22:43.025 --> 01:22:44.425
Where is she?

01:22:44.427 --> 01:22:46.493
Dana!
Where is she?

01:22:47.997 --> 01:22:49.630
Where is she?

01:22:49.632 --> 01:22:53.133
Where is she?
Huh?

01:23:02.377 --> 01:23:04.011
Clara.

01:23:11.419 --> 01:23:12.519
Clara.

01:23:17.559 --> 01:23:19.560
Clara, it's daddy.

01:24:05.407 --> 01:24:06.407
Clara...

01:24:06.409 --> 01:24:08.776
Hi, sweetie.

01:24:10.745 --> 01:24:12.146
Clara.

01:24:19.788 --> 01:24:22.589
Hi, baby. Hi, baby.

01:24:23.725 --> 01:24:25.459
Hi, baby.

01:26:41.262 --> 01:26:42.963
I love you.
