00:06.712 --> 00:08.154
We all know why we're here.

00:08.156 --> 00:09.870
We need to stop Joe Biden

00:09.871 --> 00:11.882
from running away with the
Democratic nomination.

00:11.883 --> 00:13.054
The stakes couldn't be higher...

00:13.055 --> 00:14.327
If I don't get this president job,

00:14.328 --> 00:15.601
I gotta move back in with my mom.

00:15.602 --> 00:16.804
We gotta do something quick.

00:16.805 --> 00:19.244
I promised my girlfriend that
I was gonna be president!

00:19.245 --> 00:20.703
She said that's not why she likes me,

00:20.704 --> 00:21.990
but what else could it be?!

00:21.991 --> 00:24.119
If I just introduce one more policy,

00:24.120 --> 00:26.436
then that should catapult me to the top!

00:26.437 --> 00:27.661
Lizzy, you have a problem...

00:27.662 --> 00:30.119
You gotta stop introducing policies!

00:30.120 --> 00:32.994
You're right. This calls for
a policy reduction plan...

00:32.995 --> 00:36.051
30% fewer policies by 2024!

00:36.052 --> 00:37.713
You're doing it again, Lizzy!

00:37.714 --> 00:40.448
I KNOW! BUT I CAN'T STOP!

00:40.449 --> 00:42.176
Whoa. Hey. Voters don't
want to hear about policies

00:42.177 --> 00:43.494
that improve their lives.

00:43.495 --> 00:45.327
Maybe Biden will stop campaigning

00:45.328 --> 00:47.202
if we tell every voter
to shave their head

00:47.203 --> 00:48.824
so he has no hair to smell.

00:48.825 --> 00:50.837
Ooh, I have a way to stop Joe Biden.

00:50.838 --> 00:51.870
Yes?

00:51.871 --> 00:53.828
You just gotta put a little fear in him.

00:53.829 --> 00:58.578
Like I did to a silly assistant
who forgot to charge my iPad.

00:58.579 --> 01:00.661
I deleted his Social Security number

01:00.662 --> 01:03.437
and hired a family to
move into his apartment

01:03.438 --> 01:05.411
so he thought he never existed.

01:05.412 --> 01:07.911
Last time I saw him, he was
tearing his clothes off

01:07.912 --> 01:09.745
and running into the forest!

01:09.746 --> 01:12.381
Stop it! You're scaring Pete Buttigieg!

01:12.382 --> 01:14.327
I need someone to stay in my
room until I fall asleep.

01:14.328 --> 01:17.286
I'll do it. I usually
stay up to 2 a.m. anyway

01:17.287 --> 01:19.973
searching my pockets
for oyster crackers.

01:19.974 --> 01:21.161
What about you, Bernie?

01:21.162 --> 01:23.327
You've taken a bigger hit
in the polls than anyone.

01:23.328 --> 01:26.286
Oh, I don't care about the
polls or what I look like

01:26.287 --> 01:29.111
or if I'm giving a speech in
the bathtub like a lunatic.

01:29.112 --> 01:30.830
I just care about the one percent

01:30.831 --> 01:34.258
and never biting into a
nectarine that isn't ripe!

01:34.259 --> 01:35.804
There's gotta be a way!

01:35.806 --> 01:37.771
Pete, you're the latest candidate
voters are desperately

01:37.773 --> 01:40.272
projecting their hopes onto.
How do we take down Biden?

01:40.273 --> 01:43.188
I respect Biden, but
he lacks experience.

01:43.189 --> 01:45.105
For example, has he
ever put L.E.D. bulbs

01:45.106 --> 01:46.939
in the downtown traffic lights?

01:46.940 --> 01:50.439
Oh, I didn't know it was Bring
Your Annoying Kid to Work Day.

01:50.440 --> 01:53.660
Hey, Peter, Beto here's gonna
show you how a copier works!

01:53.661 --> 01:55.355
I know how a copier works, okay?

01:55.356 --> 01:57.180
I wrote my thesis on how a copier works.

01:57.181 --> 01:59.647
We could ask Mayor de Blasio,
but he really sucks big-time.

01:59.648 --> 02:02.176
Kamala, you seem like the only
competent human being here.

02:02.177 --> 02:03.188
What should we do?

02:03.189 --> 02:04.996
I say give the nomination to Joe.

02:04.997 --> 02:06.355
He names me V.P.,

02:06.356 --> 02:08.814
I start practicing for
my Mike Pence debate.

02:08.815 --> 02:11.397
I might start right now...
"I'm a cop, Mike Pence!

02:11.398 --> 02:14.272
I have two Tasers. One
for each of your nuts!"

02:14.273 --> 02:16.689
If only we could combine
all our strengths,

02:16.690 --> 02:18.522
Joe Biden wouldn't stand a chance.

02:18.523 --> 02:19.856
I got it!

02:21.695 --> 02:23.439
Here's a question from the audience.

02:23.440 --> 02:25.439
How will you guarantee
quality health care

02:25.440 --> 02:26.731
for every American?

02:26.732 --> 02:28.731
We have developed the modern world's

02:28.732 --> 02:30.647
most comprehensive health-care plan.

02:30.648 --> 02:32.689
And it also somehow
solves global warming.

02:32.690 --> 02:34.439
Yeah!

02:34.440 --> 02:36.731
And, Mr. Biden, your health-care plan?

02:36.732 --> 02:39.105
Oh, yeah, yeah. Let me get
back to you on that one.

02:39.106 --> 02:41.647
Hey! You guys remember Barack Obama?!

02:41.648 --> 02:44.272
I was his vice president!

02:44.273 --> 02:46.939
I'm Joe Biden! Joe Biden! I'm
Joe Biden and that's it!

02:46.940 --> 02:48.230
- Damn it!
- Damn it!

02:50.523 --> 02:53.439
Sorry! The title is redacted!

03:01.328 --> 03:04.620
I'm Wolf Blitzer, and when
I shave, my beard screams.

03:04.621 --> 03:06.772
President Trump has refused to resupply

03:06.773 --> 03:10.605
the International Space Station
until Democrats approve

03:10.606 --> 03:14.064
a border wall that shoots flames
shaped like Steven Seagal.

03:14.065 --> 03:17.480
But the President caved after
millions of schoolchildren

03:17.481 --> 03:19.105
watched starving astronauts

03:19.106 --> 03:21.230
resort to eating their treadmill.

03:21.231 --> 03:24.355
Let's go live to the President. Wolf?

03:24.356 --> 03:27.564
I'm dropping this fight, even
though the astronauts told me

03:27.565 --> 03:30.188
that me getting my way was
worth an orbiting tomb.

03:30.189 --> 03:33.064
- Mr. President? Mr. President?
- Yes, Jim Acosta?

03:33.065 --> 03:35.689
Ann Coulter and Rush Limbaugh
criticized you for caving.

03:35.690 --> 03:37.772
I don't have a question. I just
wanted to see you feel bad.

03:37.773 --> 03:39.439
I didn't cave. I punted.

03:39.440 --> 03:41.105
The Dems will bobble the ball,

03:41.106 --> 03:43.022
I'll pick it up, score a touchdown,

03:43.023 --> 03:45.022
give the big halftime
locker-room speech,

03:45.023 --> 03:47.439
tell my teammates, "This is our
moment, this is our time."

03:47.440 --> 03:49.272
We come out screaming, win the game,

03:49.273 --> 03:50.772
we go party at Troy's lake house,

03:50.773 --> 03:52.355
I get my flaming border wall.

03:52.356 --> 03:53.897
No more questions.

03:53.898 --> 03:55.522
Just because you can't see us

03:55.523 --> 03:57.564
doesn't mean we can't see
the top of your head.

03:57.565 --> 04:00.313
- How about now?
- Better.

04:00.314 --> 04:04.064
Ooh! I hope Hannity's
on Hannity tonight!

04:04.065 --> 04:05.313
Everyone, shut up!

04:05.314 --> 04:07.022
Whoo! That's him!

04:07.023 --> 04:10.856
After those pathetic astronauts
undermined our president,

04:10.857 --> 04:15.064
I'm calling on all Americans
to open fire at space!

04:15.065 --> 04:17.522
Joining me now, conservative provocateur

04:17.523 --> 04:19.897
and bat-winged guardian
of Snake Mountain,

04:19.898 --> 04:21.230
Ann Coulter.

04:21.231 --> 04:22.647
Maybe she's cool now.

04:22.648 --> 04:25.064
I'm not happy with the President.

04:25.065 --> 04:26.897
Sean, the so-called "deplorables"

04:26.898 --> 04:28.814
got Trump elected, and
if he's not willing

04:28.815 --> 04:31.731
to starve astronauts to
keep out starving migrants,

04:31.732 --> 04:33.647
can he really call
himself a conservative?

04:33.648 --> 04:36.564
I am sorry, Mr. President.

04:36.565 --> 04:38.772
I should've never brought
on Slenderman's wife.

04:38.773 --> 04:40.772
Swap her out, stat!

04:40.773 --> 04:42.532
Ha! You got the goat!

04:42.533 --> 04:44.355
Ah-ha-ha! There he is!

04:44.356 --> 04:45.897
He's playing accordion! And look at it!

04:47.773 --> 04:50.605
Ann Coulter is the worst
boss in the world.

04:50.606 --> 04:52.731
Sir, the challenge of
every dumb, fat president

04:52.732 --> 04:55.313
is to balance the moderates
and the extremists.

04:55.314 --> 04:57.480
You know, the fancies
and the hill people.

04:57.481 --> 04:59.272
The moderates and the extremists.

04:59.273 --> 05:00.981
Someone just said that, Ben.

05:00.982 --> 05:02.814
Yes, I just heard myself say it.

05:02.815 --> 05:05.439
I hear myself saying stuff all the time.

05:05.440 --> 05:07.981
Sometimes it's hard to
listen to stuff I'm saying

05:07.982 --> 05:09.856
while thinking of new things to say.

05:09.858 --> 05:11.480
- Even now, I'm just...
- Holy shit.

05:11.481 --> 05:13.564
You see, being a conservative president

05:13.565 --> 05:16.647
is about riding two
horses at the same time.

05:16.648 --> 05:19.313
One horse is a spitfire
named Ann Coulter

05:19.314 --> 05:21.272
who wants to trample poor people.

05:21.273 --> 05:23.772
The other is a stallion
named Mitt Romney,

05:23.773 --> 05:27.272
who wants to do the same thing,
only while carrying a briefcase.

05:27.273 --> 05:29.022
Is that a metaphor or
do you know a horse

05:29.023 --> 05:30.355
that carries a briefcase?

05:30.356 --> 05:32.439
Forget Ann Coulter and the Deplorables.

05:32.440 --> 05:34.564
You're gonna need support
from vaccinated Republicans

05:34.565 --> 05:36.731
like Romney when the
Democrats finally figure out

05:36.732 --> 05:38.689
- that treason is a crime.
- You're right!

05:38.690 --> 05:41.397
I'm pretty sure Romney loves me
as much as someone who spends

05:41.398 --> 05:44.522
their last pennies mailing
pipe bombs to George Soros.

05:46.216 --> 05:49.439
I don't like pandering to
whackos like Ann Coulter.

05:49.440 --> 05:51.355
I like pandering to you.

05:51.356 --> 05:54.272
You're smart, savvy, eat
five yogurts a day,

05:54.273 --> 05:56.397
refer to bad drivers as "buddy,"

05:56.398 --> 05:59.147
all your teeth are the same
tooth over and over again.

05:59.148 --> 06:01.480
What I'm saying is you're great.

06:01.481 --> 06:02.981
I appreciate that, Mr. President,

06:02.982 --> 06:04.355
and I respect your office.

06:04.356 --> 06:06.647
That's not how people
talk, Mitt, but okay.

06:06.648 --> 06:09.689
The Mueller Report accused me
of some pretty baseless facts.

06:09.690 --> 06:12.147
Can I count on your fanatical,
unconditional support?

06:12.148 --> 06:13.647
Sir, my only loyalty

06:13.648 --> 06:16.147
is to my country, my God, and the truth.

06:16.148 --> 06:17.856
Lookie here, Truthy!

06:17.857 --> 06:20.939
You know all that nice stuff I
said earlier? I take it back!

06:20.940 --> 06:23.230
One tooth looks slightly
different than the other teeth.

06:23.231 --> 06:25.064
Sir, have you no decency?

06:25.065 --> 06:28.772
Oh, I have decency coming out my ass!

06:29.898 --> 06:33.105
Excuse me. "Anus." Geez!

06:33.106 --> 06:35.647
Dong! Fox News alert!

06:35.648 --> 06:37.230
I assume I'm dreaming,

06:37.231 --> 06:39.605
but cameras have just
spotted President Trump

06:39.606 --> 06:42.939
and known French spy Mitt
Romney out to dinner.

06:42.940 --> 06:45.522
God willing, the President
was just at a handjob parlor

06:45.523 --> 06:47.230
that shares a door with the restaurant

06:47.231 --> 06:48.981
and also gives to-go bags.

06:48.982 --> 06:51.105
Joining me now is Ann Coulter...

06:51.106 --> 06:52.731
Maybe it's a different Ann Coulter.

06:52.732 --> 06:54.939
- ...author of "How to Cook a Liberal."
- Damn it!

06:54.940 --> 06:57.064
The Romney dinner was a
betrayal of every Trump voter,

06:57.065 --> 07:00.272
from alcoholic Jet Ski dealers
to sunburned sheriffs.

07:00.273 --> 07:02.397
The President takes
us for granted, Sean.

07:02.398 --> 07:04.939
He probably doesn't even want
to shove fleeing refugees.

07:04.940 --> 07:07.015
That's a low blow, Ann!

07:07.016 --> 07:08.235
You know he does!

07:10.189 --> 07:12.313
Taggart Romney, what are
you still doing up?

07:12.314 --> 07:13.689
It's nearly dusk.

07:13.690 --> 07:14.981
I got a stomach ache

07:14.982 --> 07:17.188
from laughing too hard
at a Popsicle joke.

07:17.189 --> 07:18.731
How was your dinner with the President?

07:18.732 --> 07:20.605
Did you guys talk about
the Constitution?

07:20.606 --> 07:23.689
I tried, but he was too busy
using my hand to play that game

07:23.690 --> 07:25.814
where you stab the knife between
your fingers real fast.

07:25.815 --> 07:27.564
Then he asked for a loyalty pledge.

07:27.565 --> 07:30.230
- Did you call 911?
- I did.

07:30.231 --> 07:32.522
The dispatcher said a
violation of decency

07:32.523 --> 07:34.147
was not an emergency and hung up.

07:34.148 --> 07:36.522
Cat-scratches! What are you gonna do?

07:36.523 --> 07:38.480
The only thing I can do...

07:38.481 --> 07:40.772
Shave my face three times and go to bed.

07:42.077 --> 07:43.731
My party's being mean,

07:43.732 --> 07:46.939
and not even spaghetti in the
steam room can cheer me up.

07:49.831 --> 07:51.355
E.T.?

07:51.356 --> 07:54.397
It's someone more lovable than E.T....

07:54.398 --> 07:56.814
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.

07:56.815 --> 07:59.564
- Pffff.
- Don, I came here for two reasons.

07:59.565 --> 08:03.147
One, if I don't steam
naked every 36 hours,

08:03.148 --> 08:05.397
- my skin turns to puff pastry...
- Uh-huh.

08:05.398 --> 08:07.022
...and to tell you

08:07.023 --> 08:09.564
that when the Democrats'
impeachment dogs are closing in,

08:09.565 --> 08:11.564
Mitt Romney ain't gonna defend you.

08:11.565 --> 08:15.647
But Coulter and your army
of screaming shut-ins will,

08:15.648 --> 08:17.480
just to own the libs.

08:17.481 --> 08:19.564
So be the gross man

08:19.565 --> 08:22.397
they lost contact with
their families over.

08:22.398 --> 08:25.188
I can only try!

08:27.648 --> 08:30.814
Hey! We weren't done watching
Little House on the Prairie!

08:30.815 --> 08:32.772
Laura just found a bottle in the creek!

08:32.773 --> 08:34.981
Due to the President's
indecency, I barely slept

08:34.982 --> 08:36.772
15 hours last night,

08:36.773 --> 08:39.272
so I've decided to
speak out against him.

08:39.273 --> 08:41.147
My hero!

08:41.148 --> 08:43.772
And when he resigns in shame,
I'll reluctantly accept

08:43.773 --> 08:45.897
the nation's will and assume the office

08:45.898 --> 08:47.981
I've single-mindedly
sought my entire life.

08:47.982 --> 08:49.647
Prepare yourselves for the right-wingers

08:49.648 --> 08:50.981
to come at us pretty hard.

08:50.982 --> 08:53.439
Are they gonna call us "snuggle worms"?

08:55.231 --> 08:57.939
A dry sponge to your tongue for
even the suggestion of it!

09:00.606 --> 09:02.856
Hey! We weren't done watching Sex Town!

09:02.857 --> 09:04.939
The town was just about to have sex!

09:04.940 --> 09:06.281
Oh. Sorry.

09:06.283 --> 09:09.272
Okay, Town, let's have sex!

09:09.273 --> 09:11.856
Family, I've decided to set aside

09:11.857 --> 09:14.313
my natural Ronald Reagan-esque decency

09:14.314 --> 09:15.814
and go balls deep

09:15.815 --> 09:17.897
on the deplorable wing of our party.

09:17.898 --> 09:19.564
- Hell yeah!
- You go, Daddy!

09:19.565 --> 09:21.188
What were we doing before?

09:21.189 --> 09:24.022
I'm just not sure I can be as
gross as they need me to be.

09:24.023 --> 09:25.272
I'll take this one.

09:25.273 --> 09:27.814
Donald, I want you to listen to me.

09:27.815 --> 09:30.647
You're the most disgusting man on Earth.

09:30.648 --> 09:34.147
You're small-minded, you're
selfish, you're cruel,

09:34.148 --> 09:37.105
you smell before, during,
and after bathing,

09:37.106 --> 09:39.689
you're constantly stepping on
my feet without realizing it,

09:39.690 --> 09:42.188
you sweat formaldehyde and piss tar,

09:42.189 --> 09:44.564
you crank-call homeless shelters
to make them listen to you

09:44.565 --> 09:47.397
chew pizza in bed, and you
poop when you sneeze.

09:47.398 --> 09:49.397
You could've just said I could do it.

09:49.398 --> 09:50.772
I'm going to become

09:50.773 --> 09:53.814
the most vile, detestable
president in history

09:53.815 --> 09:57.188
so Ann Coulter will cut me some slack!

09:59.842 --> 10:03.689
I'm so glad your presidency is
getting even more deplorable.

10:03.690 --> 10:05.939
Us dirtbags finally have a voice.

10:05.940 --> 10:07.564
Shut up. Thanks, Don.

10:07.565 --> 10:09.105
But I gotta brush up on the basics.

10:09.106 --> 10:10.647
That's why I've called a meeting

10:10.648 --> 10:13.188
with the dean of disgusting
himself... Rudy Giuliani.

10:13.189 --> 10:15.064
So, what are we thinking, guys?

10:15.065 --> 10:17.105
Do we wanna get some oysters,
wanna get a big mushroom,

10:17.106 --> 10:19.439
slap some nacho cheese on it,
put our cigars out in it?!

10:19.440 --> 10:22.689
We need wine! Red wine!
Thickest one ya got!

10:22.690 --> 10:24.272
I want it to come out like ketchup!

10:24.273 --> 10:25.973
By the time we leave here,
they're gonna have to

10:25.975 --> 10:27.355
burn this tablecloth in the park.

10:29.815 --> 10:32.147
I swallowed the cigar
again. I do this so much,

10:32.148 --> 10:34.045
the doctor just taught me
how to pump my own stomach.

10:34.047 --> 10:36.188
Sick! This guy makes me sick!

10:36.189 --> 10:38.689
More wine, you goddamn bastards!

10:38.690 --> 10:40.689
Rudy, this is important. Can you focus?

10:40.690 --> 10:42.731
I am focused. I'm
focused on the painting

10:42.732 --> 10:44.188
of the lady with huge knockers.

10:44.189 --> 10:46.397
I cheated on my wife
with a lady like that.

10:46.398 --> 10:48.313
I weighed her knockers.
They didn't weigh the same.

10:48.314 --> 10:50.814
Close, but I was still angry.
They should weigh the same!

10:50.815 --> 10:52.397
Rudy, I need to shore up my base!

10:52.398 --> 10:53.897
Why didn't you say so?

10:53.898 --> 10:55.397
All right. Here's what I'm thinking.

10:55.398 --> 10:58.230
You, me, knockers painting,
we go to Flashdancers, and...

10:58.231 --> 11:00.564
I-I can't think in here!

11:00.565 --> 11:03.147
Hear ye, hear ye.

11:03.148 --> 11:04.939
To address the President's
vile behavior,

11:04.940 --> 11:07.022
I call to order the inaugural meeting

11:07.023 --> 11:09.105
of the Decent Republicans Caucus.

11:09.106 --> 11:11.355
Roll call. Senator Susan Collins?

11:11.356 --> 11:15.230
Present. I love to signal that
I'm one of the good Republicans,

11:15.231 --> 11:16.939
disappear for two days,

11:16.940 --> 11:20.188
then vote a drunk sex maniac
onto the Supreme Court.

11:20.189 --> 11:22.313
Great. First order of business,

11:22.314 --> 11:24.981
reclaiming our party from the
filthy grip of Donald Trump.

11:24.982 --> 11:27.397
- I'm all-in.
- Let's come out of the gate

11:27.398 --> 11:29.439
with a firmly worded, untelevised speech

11:29.440 --> 11:31.439
at the Lincoln Memorial
on a Tuesday afternoon.

11:31.440 --> 11:33.647
Huzzah! Great idea.

11:33.648 --> 11:36.230
Just give me two days to think about it.

11:36.231 --> 11:38.814
Hmm. According to my notes,
you said you were "all-in."

11:38.815 --> 11:40.397
Oh, I so am.

11:40.398 --> 11:42.064
Just give me two days,

11:42.065 --> 11:44.772
then I'll say if I'm a
"no" or a "maybe yes."

11:44.773 --> 11:47.480
Why do I sense that in two days
you will flip on the issue?

11:47.481 --> 11:51.022
Is this the famous Mitt
Romney sense of humor?

11:51.023 --> 11:54.273
I'm one of the good Republicans.
Who just needs two days.

11:55.648 --> 11:58.564
Giuliani was completely useless.

11:58.565 --> 12:01.230
I'm so glad he's only in charge
of whether or not I go to jail.

12:01.231 --> 12:04.272
Dad, I brought you a
Republican that's an expert

12:04.273 --> 12:06.564
at poking a stick in the
right wing's lizard brain.

12:06.565 --> 12:08.605
Ted Cruuuzz!

12:08.606 --> 12:11.355
Anything to help the man
who flew down to Texas

12:11.356 --> 12:14.147
days before my election
and dragged my concussed,

12:14.148 --> 12:16.522
unresponsive body into the end zone!

12:16.523 --> 12:20.313
Ted, Ann Coulter friggin' loves
your ugly ass. How do you do it?

12:20.314 --> 12:24.188
Well, to keep the deplorables
happy, ya never compromise!

12:24.189 --> 12:26.647
Even if it means a mob
calling you a "rat bastard"

12:26.648 --> 12:29.522
and running you out of town so
you seek refuge in a church,

12:29.523 --> 12:32.939
but the priest runs downstairs
and beats you with a cross,

12:32.940 --> 12:35.522
so you hide in a 7-Eleven,
but the lottery machine

12:35.523 --> 12:38.397
keeps spitting tickets
with the number 6-6-6,

12:38.398 --> 12:40.355
so the clerk pushes you off a cliff,

12:40.356 --> 12:43.147
and a bus of little children
stomp on your wormy fingers,

12:43.148 --> 12:45.355
screaming, "End the scum!"

12:45.356 --> 12:48.315
I don't know. I don't
wanna go to a church.

12:49.982 --> 12:52.439
- Senator Collins?
- Who is it?

12:52.440 --> 12:55.439
Uh, Senator Mitt Romney.
It's been two days.

12:55.440 --> 12:57.605
Have you decided if you'll join
me in denouncing the President?

12:57.606 --> 12:59.814
I need two more days.

12:59.815 --> 13:01.814
What will be different in two days?

13:01.815 --> 13:04.230
It'll be two days from now.

13:04.231 --> 13:06.064
Susan, are you committed to the mission

13:06.065 --> 13:08.188
of the Decent Republicans Caucus?

13:08.189 --> 13:09.897
Ring ring!

13:09.898 --> 13:13.522
Your wife just called and told
me to tell you to go home.

13:13.523 --> 13:15.439
What's my wife's name?

13:15.440 --> 13:18.230
Susan's mailbox is full. Goodbye.

13:21.440 --> 13:24.981
Stevie! Nobody embodies
deplorable Republicans

13:24.982 --> 13:27.647
more than someone with your
beautiful pulsing head.

13:27.648 --> 13:29.939
Now, how do I make them love me forever?

13:29.940 --> 13:32.689
The pulsing is voluntary.
Now, take a look at this.

13:32.690 --> 13:33.939
As a cute, little hobby,

13:33.940 --> 13:35.981
I measure the ultraviolet heat index

13:35.982 --> 13:38.064
of our most loyal screeching mole rats.

13:38.065 --> 13:40.605
Now, here's where it got
Chernobyl-level hot!

13:40.606 --> 13:43.272
Lock her up! Lock her up!

13:43.273 --> 13:46.939
In conclusion, we should
arrest Hillary Cli...

13:46.940 --> 13:49.814
Dad! You should lock up Hillary Clinton!

13:49.815 --> 13:51.313
Great idea!

13:51.314 --> 13:55.065
Miller, our time on Earth is
precious. Stop wasting it.

13:56.231 --> 13:58.105
That's when they called Wisconsin,

13:58.106 --> 14:00.897
and there was not a dry
eye in the Javits Center.

14:00.898 --> 14:02.731
How was your day?

14:02.732 --> 14:05.313
Ugh. Spent the day trying
to convince Ronan Farrow

14:05.314 --> 14:07.439
to report me to the FBI.

14:07.440 --> 14:09.480
Hillary, I'm so tired of runnin'.

14:09.481 --> 14:11.814
Oh, Bill, it's been 40 years.

14:11.815 --> 14:15.313
I'm sure you'll never be held
accountable for your actions.

14:15.314 --> 14:16.605
FBI! Open up!

14:16.606 --> 14:20.272
Yippee! Come on in! I got
cookies, I got cake!

14:20.273 --> 14:23.147
I am proud to announce that, tonight,

14:23.148 --> 14:25.647
the Federal Bureau of Investigation

14:25.648 --> 14:29.313
arrested Crooked Hillary for
the crime of mega-treason,

14:29.314 --> 14:31.480
fulfilling one of my strongest

14:31.481 --> 14:34.313
and most deplorable campaign promises.

14:34.314 --> 14:39.105
In 72 hours, she will receive
a fair trial by combat.

14:39.106 --> 14:41.856
She's fighting a dangerous jungle cat

14:41.857 --> 14:44.439
in the well of the House
of Representatives.

14:44.440 --> 14:46.397
Aren't we better than this?

14:46.398 --> 14:50.647
Wow! Every word out of her mouth
just makes me more excited.

14:50.648 --> 14:54.064
Today, I speak out in
defense of decency.

14:54.065 --> 14:56.522
Our most decent president,
Ronald Reagan,

14:56.523 --> 14:59.981
once called the United States
"a shining city on a hill."

14:59.982 --> 15:03.188
And it is my strong opinion
that President Donald Trump

15:03.189 --> 15:05.856
has ever so slightly dimmed
that light, no offense.

15:05.857 --> 15:09.355
Hey, podium boy! I'm trying
to take a picture! Move!

15:09.356 --> 15:11.939
Oh, no. Am I late? Did I miss it?

15:11.940 --> 15:13.814
Well, good job. I've gotta go.

15:13.815 --> 15:15.022
Your shoe fell off.

15:15.023 --> 15:17.313
Keep it! I've got more!

15:21.023 --> 15:23.313
Folks, at long last,
the streets are safe

15:23.314 --> 15:24.981
from Hillary Clinton!

15:24.982 --> 15:27.689
Leave your doors unlocked,
put away the bazookas,

15:27.690 --> 15:29.188
and go ahead and flash your brights

15:29.189 --> 15:30.897
at people whose headlights aren't on

15:30.898 --> 15:33.355
without worrying about being
targeted for a thrill-killing.

15:33.356 --> 15:34.689
Ann, get in here.

15:34.690 --> 15:37.897
Donald Trump has restored law and order,

15:37.898 --> 15:41.147
letting people know you can't
just compete in a free election

15:41.148 --> 15:43.188
against him and get away with it.

15:43.189 --> 15:44.689
Burn the paintings!

15:44.690 --> 15:48.022
Anything that doesn't have
Trump's face on it isn't art!

15:48.023 --> 15:50.272
Hey, happy Hannity, happy life.

15:50.273 --> 15:53.731
Mr. President? Republican
megadonor Sheldon Adelson

15:53.732 --> 15:56.564
wants to see you in the
cabinet room. Uh-oh.

15:56.565 --> 15:58.355
You know, if you wanted

15:58.356 --> 16:01.190
to compliment me, you could've
just done it on the phone.

16:03.000 --> 16:09.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

16:49.763 --> 16:52.550
Sorry. All I heard was the word "meat."

17:00.148 --> 17:01.959
Still only hearing "meat."

17:10.065 --> 17:13.064
Hello, Dangerous Donald.

17:13.065 --> 17:16.396
Hello... Dumb Hillary.

17:16.397 --> 17:19.146
Sheldon Adelson says I should free you,

17:19.147 --> 17:21.105
Ann Coulter says I shouldn't,

17:21.106 --> 17:22.814
and you're the only
person in the White House

17:22.815 --> 17:26.065
whose résumé isn't full
of knockoff stereo scams.

17:26.066 --> 17:27.564
What should I do?

17:27.565 --> 17:30.605
Oh, Donald. You could have had it all.

17:30.606 --> 17:33.689
A hotel in Moscow. A television network.

17:33.690 --> 17:38.064
And now look at you... being
torn apart by two wild horses.

17:38.065 --> 17:39.856
Hey, if I wanted a psychiatrist,

17:39.857 --> 17:42.522
I would've taken the advice
of everyone I've ever met.

17:42.523 --> 17:44.064
Should I let you go?

17:44.065 --> 17:45.856
That's the kind of painful choice

17:45.857 --> 17:47.522
I do not have to make anymore,

17:47.523 --> 17:51.856
thanks to my tranquil new
life inside this box.

17:51.857 --> 17:54.355
Ohh. You're so lucky.

17:54.356 --> 17:57.105
What I wouldn't give to
trade places with you.

17:59.690 --> 18:02.105
Ah, you win again.

18:02.106 --> 18:05.022
Art of the deal, baby. Still got it.

18:05.023 --> 18:07.939
An easy speech to deliver, it was not.

18:07.940 --> 18:10.230
It was 63 degrees outside,

18:10.231 --> 18:12.772
well below the body's temperature,
but I soldiered on.

18:12.773 --> 18:14.522
Tell it again, Dad!

18:14.523 --> 18:16.022
Another day.

18:16.023 --> 18:18.105
Let's check the news to
see if the President

18:18.106 --> 18:20.564
soberly absorbed my comments
and vowed to do better.

18:20.565 --> 18:22.439
Hmm.

18:22.440 --> 18:24.897
The President hasn't commented
on my brave speech.

18:24.898 --> 18:26.814
I'm sure he's just praying on it.

18:26.815 --> 18:28.772
The President is not a man of faith.

18:28.773 --> 18:31.188
He once told me that Jesus
was good at computers.

18:31.189 --> 18:32.856
Well, if one thing is certain,

18:32.857 --> 18:34.689
it's that I did everything I could.

18:34.690 --> 18:37.356
If anyone needs me, I'll be
standing quietly in the garage.

18:38.482 --> 18:39.772
And now a message

18:39.773 --> 18:41.772
from the President of the United States.

18:41.773 --> 18:43.522
So, two things.

18:43.523 --> 18:46.439
One, the nation is getting
bagels on Friday,

18:46.440 --> 18:47.731
so that's good.

18:49.815 --> 18:51.522
Two, I know the fake news said

18:51.523 --> 18:53.897
that Hillary tricked me into
locking myself in here,

18:53.898 --> 18:55.522
but actually, I did it

18:55.523 --> 18:57.647
because a melting
billionaire told me to.

18:57.648 --> 18:59.689
Then I goofed around and got burned.

18:59.690 --> 19:02.313
Anyways, Pompeo's out
buying bolt cutters.

19:02.314 --> 19:05.022
Enjoy those bagels!

19:05.023 --> 19:09.272
I love my president, but how
could he just let Hillary go?!

19:09.273 --> 19:11.313
I was wrong to endorse Donald Trump

19:11.314 --> 19:13.647
in the books I write for
people to read on airplanes

19:13.648 --> 19:15.939
that let everyone know they're
going to be a handful.

19:15.940 --> 19:17.689
I'm calling on the Republican Party

19:17.690 --> 19:19.147
to find a new candidate

19:19.148 --> 19:21.647
and, if need be, I will enter the race!

19:21.648 --> 19:25.355
Holy crap! Coulter and Trump
both running for prez?!

19:25.356 --> 19:27.188
It's like you're each holding a treat

19:27.189 --> 19:29.272
and I'm the puppy
deciding whether to live

19:29.273 --> 19:31.355
at Mom's house or Dad's house!

19:31.356 --> 19:33.188
This is a real bummer after
all those nice things

19:33.189 --> 19:34.522
you said to motivate me.

19:34.523 --> 19:37.022
You're a thief, a cheat, a racist,

19:37.023 --> 19:38.731
a terrible Pictionary player,

19:38.732 --> 19:40.939
you leave your ass hairs all
over the toilet seat...

19:40.940 --> 19:44.272
All right. I think we've got
enough gas in the tank, Melania.

19:45.898 --> 19:49.355
Susan? Uh, your staff informed
me that in order to avoid me,

19:49.356 --> 19:51.313
you've sealed yourself inside a wall.

19:51.314 --> 19:53.313
Susan's not here right now.

19:53.314 --> 19:55.022
I'm a smart wall.

19:55.023 --> 19:58.064
Beep-boop! Your toothpaste
order has shipped.

19:58.065 --> 20:00.480
You should know that I've decided

20:00.481 --> 20:02.439
to leave the Decent Republicans Caucus.

20:02.440 --> 20:04.564
Oh, what? No.

20:04.565 --> 20:07.573
Will you carry the torch
forward, proud and tall?

20:07.575 --> 20:10.772
Can't. No hands. I'm a wall.

20:10.773 --> 20:12.062
I understand.

20:12.064 --> 20:14.272
I have failed my family, my country,

20:14.273 --> 20:17.689
my favorite brand of digestive
biscuits, and my God.

20:17.690 --> 20:20.355
And I'm deeply sorry.

20:20.356 --> 20:22.564
I have to get out of this wall.

20:22.565 --> 20:25.064
Unless staying in the wall polls better.

20:25.065 --> 20:27.188
Wait for the data, Susie.

20:27.189 --> 20:29.647
I said, "Go to wherever

20:29.648 --> 20:31.647
they filmed The Hangover Part II!"

20:31.648 --> 20:33.897
Hangover Part II now!

20:33.898 --> 20:36.022
- Don, what are you doing?
- Running away!

20:36.023 --> 20:37.647
I bought a friggin' tiger,

20:37.648 --> 20:39.981
and now we're not even
gonna feed Hillary to it!

20:39.982 --> 20:41.731
Just put the tiger in the East Room.

20:41.732 --> 20:43.397
I'm sure one of my cabinet members

20:43.398 --> 20:44.772
will come by and shoot it.

20:44.773 --> 20:47.022
I know. That's not my concern.

20:47.023 --> 20:50.939
When you became a deplorable
slimeball, I finally felt heard,

20:50.940 --> 20:53.355
not only as a voter, but as a son.

20:53.356 --> 20:55.313
But it turns out, you're just another

20:55.314 --> 20:57.522
upstanding member of polite society.

20:57.523 --> 20:59.939
So I'm going to the
Hangover Part II place,

20:59.940 --> 21:02.981
where I'll be treated like a
synthetic weed-smoking god.

21:02.982 --> 21:04.981
Fine, Don, but don't come back

21:04.982 --> 21:07.272
unless you bring me a cool souvenir,

21:07.273 --> 21:09.689
like a T-shirt that says,
"I Live at the Corner

21:09.690 --> 21:12.897
of 'Kiss My Ass Avenue'
and 'No Friggin' Way'."

21:15.648 --> 21:19.439
What if he never comes
back with that shirt?

21:19.440 --> 21:22.522
Donald Trump claims he's deplorable,

21:22.523 --> 21:24.480
but does his record support it?

21:24.481 --> 21:26.230
Did you know that his 18-person cabinet

21:26.231 --> 21:28.647
is packed to the brim with three women?

21:28.648 --> 21:30.397
Sure, he arrested Hillary Clinton,

21:30.398 --> 21:32.647
but he broke his promise
to feed her to a tiger.

21:32.648 --> 21:35.355
In 2020, we need a candidate

21:35.356 --> 21:37.105
whose neo-fascism is not for sale.

21:37.106 --> 21:40.092
Paid for by the Draft Ann Coulter
for President Committee.

21:40.094 --> 21:41.605
I feel pretty stupid

21:41.606 --> 21:44.105
for donating 10,000 bucks
to that committee.

21:44.106 --> 21:46.731
Boys, Daddy Romney

21:46.732 --> 21:49.731
has realized that
Republican decency is dead

21:49.732 --> 21:52.689
and so, to claw my way to the
presidency as God ordained,

21:52.690 --> 21:55.313
I must take on some pretty
repulsive behavior.

21:55.314 --> 21:58.064
Are you going to tie a
Starburst wrapper into a knot

21:58.065 --> 22:00.647
with your tongue to prove
you're a good French kisser?!

22:00.648 --> 22:02.522
I don't want you to see me like this.

22:02.523 --> 22:04.480
Promise you'll sleep
for the next 72 hours.

22:04.481 --> 22:06.814
You heard Dad. To the family bed!

22:06.815 --> 22:08.564
Go! Go! Go!

22:08.565 --> 22:10.981
Hello, fellow MAGA heads.

22:10.982 --> 22:13.022
You know what I don't like? Immigrants.

22:13.023 --> 22:14.816
A-And you know what I do like?

22:14.818 --> 22:16.605
Children armed to the teeth.

22:16.606 --> 22:19.313
I know all the cursed words,
and I say them frequently.

22:19.314 --> 22:21.064
I don't feel good.

22:22.341 --> 22:25.188
I like women with small
brains and large breasts.

22:26.982 --> 22:29.939
I have big hands and a
corresponding big johns...

22:31.481 --> 22:35.210
Whoa! Mitt Romney's barfin'! Oh, yeah!

22:38.148 --> 22:41.397
God damn it! Why won't you
cheer me up, spaghetti?!

22:49.690 --> 22:50.939
Um...

22:50.940 --> 22:52.564
Hmm?

22:55.273 --> 22:57.856
Well, hello, Mr. Trump.

22:57.857 --> 23:00.647
Hollywood starlet Ronald Reagan?

23:00.648 --> 23:03.022
Wow! So this is heaven.

23:03.023 --> 23:06.188
You had a 50/50 shot, but, uh, no.

23:09.106 --> 23:10.814
Listen to me, Donald.

23:10.815 --> 23:13.313
Everyone's been telling
you the Republican Party

23:13.314 --> 23:16.564
has two horses and you
need to ride them both.

23:16.565 --> 23:21.064
But the party is actually one
horse with two different heads.

23:21.065 --> 23:22.897
What's the, uh, penis situation?

23:22.898 --> 23:26.731
For decades, the buttoned-up,
good Republican presidents

23:26.732 --> 23:30.064
have enacted modern history's
grossest policies...

23:30.065 --> 23:32.605
The War on Drugs, ending welfare,

23:32.606 --> 23:35.439
couple of Iraq Wars, and
ignoring the AIDS crisis.

23:35.440 --> 23:37.480
That last one was you.

23:37.481 --> 23:39.105
In a way, they were all me,

23:39.106 --> 23:41.230
and I'm not ashamed of it, either.

23:41.231 --> 23:46.772
See, an inner-grossness connects
all Republicans, even you.

23:46.773 --> 23:48.564
Now, go, Donald.

23:48.565 --> 23:51.439
Be the grossest Republican you can be.

23:51.440 --> 23:53.522
Oh, and one more thing.

23:53.523 --> 23:54.897
Yes, sir?

23:54.898 --> 23:57.981
AIDS isn't real.

24:00.982 --> 24:03.939
Ugh! Hunh!

24:03.940 --> 24:05.313
Thanks, Wilbur.

24:05.314 --> 24:06.647
Oh, you're not dead.

24:06.648 --> 24:09.188
I just saw a corpse and
wanted to kick it.

24:09.189 --> 24:12.064
Dad, are you okay?

24:12.065 --> 24:13.814
My outrageous MAGA rally

24:13.815 --> 24:16.230
got me invited to Gene
Simmons' birthday party.

24:16.231 --> 24:19.022
It's "bring your own lube."
Do we have any Wesson oil?

24:19.023 --> 24:20.814
You're attending?!

24:20.815 --> 24:22.897
These are the sorts of
events I must attend

24:22.898 --> 24:24.689
to survive in the Republican Party.

24:24.690 --> 24:26.689
Dad, don't lose faith.

24:26.690 --> 24:30.105
The Grand Old Party still
has room for decency.

24:30.106 --> 24:32.022
Just look at its history...

24:32.023 --> 24:34.772
The War on Drugs, ending welfare,

24:34.773 --> 24:37.853
all those Iraq Wars, and
ignoring the AIDS crisis.

24:37.855 --> 24:39.272
I guess we always have been

24:39.273 --> 24:41.022
on the right side of
history, haven't we?

24:41.023 --> 24:43.188
Tagg, I used to think the
two G's in your name

24:43.189 --> 24:44.605
stood for "Good Guy."

24:44.606 --> 24:47.170
Now I know they stand for "Great Guy."

24:48.864 --> 24:50.397
What are you doing back?

24:50.398 --> 24:52.605
I ran over some guy with
a speedboat in Thailand.

24:52.606 --> 24:54.313
I was pretty sure he was already dead.

24:54.314 --> 24:56.313
Anyways, I had to take
the first flight back.

24:56.314 --> 25:00.147
Don, I had you, the party,
all of it, all wrong.

25:00.148 --> 25:03.313
We're all deplorable,
especially Ronald Reagan.

25:03.314 --> 25:04.872
He armed the Taliban.

25:04.874 --> 25:07.564
Shut up! I thought Reagan was a nerd.

25:07.565 --> 25:10.355
Now, we need to show this party
that they don't have to choose

25:10.356 --> 25:13.480
between being deplorable and
being good Republicans.

25:13.481 --> 25:15.022
Has anyone shot the tiger yet?

25:15.023 --> 25:18.230
John Bolton grazed it,
so it's super-pissed!

25:18.231 --> 25:19.856
Tell Attorney General William Barr

25:19.857 --> 25:22.480
we need a warrant to
arrest Hillary Clinton!

25:22.481 --> 25:24.147
But what if he won't sign it?

25:24.148 --> 25:27.064
Ah, never mind. He sent over
some blanks this morning.

25:27.065 --> 25:29.814
Before we get this show on the road,

25:29.815 --> 25:32.731
I want to say that
Ronald Reagan was right.

25:32.732 --> 25:35.772
America is a shining city on a hill.

25:35.773 --> 25:38.522
But when you get up close, you
notice that it's only shining

25:38.523 --> 25:41.981
because there's a bunch of
fake gold, illegal fireworks,

25:41.982 --> 25:44.814
and pervs experimenting
with flammable lubricants.

25:44.815 --> 25:47.064
I guess what I'm saying is,

25:47.065 --> 25:49.772
as much as the GOP pretends it's not,

25:49.773 --> 25:53.523
it is, from top to bottom,
super duper gross.

25:56.378 --> 25:59.897
In honor of this rich tradition,
please direct your attention

25:59.898 --> 26:04.147
to the most vivid
representation of our ideals...

26:04.148 --> 26:08.064
Hillary Clinton being fed
to an agitated tiger!

26:09.314 --> 26:12.147
Yeah-ah-ah! Washington is
finally working for me!

26:12.148 --> 26:14.939
That's one big Pokémon.

26:14.940 --> 26:17.605
Stop That's not true, Mr. President!

26:17.606 --> 26:20.105
This is the party of decency.

26:20.106 --> 26:23.022
Yeah, fuck you!

26:23.023 --> 26:24.981
When Reagan said we're a shinning city,

26:24.982 --> 26:27.731
he meant you got to look at
this country from far away,

26:27.732 --> 26:29.856
using binoculars,
standing on the balcony

26:29.857 --> 26:31.772
of your really nice house,

26:31.773 --> 26:34.689
and that's why decency will always w...

26:34.690 --> 26:36.981
Oh, snuggle worms.

26:38.565 --> 26:41.022
Oh, no. Did I miss it again?

26:41.023 --> 26:44.272
Wish I could help. Gotta go.

26:44.273 --> 26:45.856
Whoa. For a boring guy,

26:45.857 --> 26:48.147
Mitt's got a lot going on inside of him.

26:48.148 --> 26:51.188
After what you did to Hillary,

26:51.189 --> 26:54.522
there isn't a Republican alive
that would abandon you.

26:54.523 --> 26:57.522
I'm proud of you, Dad.
Hey. Check it out.

26:57.523 --> 26:59.689
Aw. Thanks, Don.

26:59.690 --> 27:01.772
Well, Hillary may have gotten away,

27:01.773 --> 27:04.105
and Mitt Romney might still
be clinging to life,

27:04.106 --> 27:06.313
but at least I showed
that any Republican

27:06.314 --> 27:08.230
who acts like they're better than me

27:08.231 --> 27:11.017
is absolutely kidding themselves.

27:12.037 --> 27:14.605
I just want to tell everyone
sorry that I put the family

27:14.606 --> 27:16.105
through yet another trying ordeal.

27:16.106 --> 27:18.105
Aw. It's okay.

27:18.106 --> 27:21.397
The important thing is you
stood up for what's right.

27:21.398 --> 27:23.772
And I learned that when
it comes down to it,

27:23.773 --> 27:27.272
the most decent thing anyone
can do is not make a big fuss.

27:27.273 --> 27:28.522
Hooray!

27:28.523 --> 27:31.272
Oh, what happened to
your face? Did you fall?

27:31.273 --> 27:33.147
Anyways, I've made my decision

27:33.148 --> 27:37.105
on whether to stay in the
Decent Republicans Caucus.

27:37.106 --> 27:38.540
And?
