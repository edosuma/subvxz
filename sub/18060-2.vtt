You have a bounty

you have two camels outside.

-I have been very fortunate.
-Indeed.

01:59.953 --> 02:01.288
I am not sure what you mean.

02:01.371 --> 02:04.791
My good fortune

we don't know where Cyrus is.

I'm not sure you're clear
on what the word "we" means.

It's a two-step plan.
Step one, we find the bottle.

05:14.064 --> 05:16.400
Step two, we make three harmless wishes.

05:16.483 --> 05:19.194
And no matter where he is,
he'll just get drawn back inside.

05:19.278 --> 05:21.154
You said there's no such thing
as a harmless wish.

05:21.238 --> 05:23.365
True, that's if you wish
for something big.

But if you wish for something
small and innocent,

05:26.243 --> 05:28.495

13:01.281 --> 13:03.784
Of course. It's my job,
and I'm a professional.

13:03.909 --> 13:05.702
I don't let feelings
get in the way of my work,

13:05.827 --> 13:08.539
especially old feelings that
I've completely moved on from.

13:10.040 --> 13:11.834
-Okay. Thank you very much.
-Mmm.

13:14.294 --> 13:16.630
-(NUDGES)
-Yeah, thank you very much.

13:16.922 --> 13:18.549
(EXHALES) Excellent. Well, then,

13:18.632 --> 13:21.260
we need to get to the Tum Tum Tree
in Mimsy Meadows.

13:22.344 --> 13:24.054
What? I need to tell her
where we're going.

13:25.472 --> 13:26.890
Don't worry.
You can trust me.

13:27.391 --> 13:28.517
I'm here to help.

13:41.238 --> 13:43.156
That burn you got from the bars...

13:44.074 --> 13:47.619
I'm starting to understand
why yours is the only cage made of silver.

13:48.704 --> 13:50.539
Is that to keep you
from escaping?

13:51.123 --> 13:53.417
It's to keep me from
even thinking of escaping.

13:54.501 --> 13:57.212
Genies and silver... We don't mix.

13:57.921 --> 14:00.924
Perhaps we can take
your mind off the pain.

14:01.758 --> 14:03.302
(SIGHS)

14:03.427 --> 14:07.139
Last move was rook to D3.

14:08.765 --> 14:10.851
Sorry, old man.
I can't play with you today.

14:11.685 --> 14:13.353
(CHUCKLES)

14:13.520 --> 14:16.315
You have something better
to do? (CHUCKLES)

14:19.651 --> 14:20.861
Yes.

14:22.863 --> 14:25.407
Actually... I do.

14:26.074 --> 14:27.701
(RIPS FABRIC)

14:40.547 --> 14:42.716
Mistress mine, my will is thine.

14:44.718 --> 14:45.928
Open your hand.

14:46.512 --> 14:49.014
-What?
-Your hand. Open it.

14:52.476 --> 14:53.769
What are these?

14:54.019 --> 14:55.103
They're your wishes.

14:56.104 --> 14:57.648
Ah, they're so pretty.

14:58.148 --> 14:59.149
As are you.

14:59.608 --> 15:01.568
(CLEARS THROAT) Forget about me?

15:01.652 --> 15:03.445
Oh. Sorry, Rabbit.

15:05.447 --> 15:07.199
Oh. (GRUNTS)

15:07.741 --> 15:08.825
No hard feelings?

15:09.201 --> 15:10.953
No, I suppose it's my fault.

15:11.036 --> 15:13.497
I never should have led you
down here in the first place.

15:13.580 --> 15:15.332
It's been nothing but trouble for you.

15:15.624 --> 15:17.668
You didn't lead me here. I followed you.

15:18.043 --> 15:19.711
WHITE RABBIT: You always were
a curious girl.

15:20.337 --> 15:21.630
Good luck, Alice.

15:25.342 --> 15:26.677
So what happens now?

15:27.678 --> 15:29.096
Anything.

15:29.179 --> 15:30.180
Everything.

15:30.681 --> 15:32.307
So I can wish for anything I want?

15:32.516 --> 15:34.643
Ah. There are a few restrictions.

15:34.810 --> 15:36.520
The laws of magic, as it were.

15:36.603 --> 15:37.938
-Laws of magic?
-Yes.

15:38.188 --> 15:40.482
There are four of them.
I can't kill anyone.

15:40.941 --> 15:42.526
I can't bring anything
back from the dead.

15:42.651 --> 15:43.902
I can't change the past.

15:43.986 --> 15:46.113
And I can't make anyone fall in love.

15:48.365 --> 15:49.700
Reasonable enough.

15:51.118 --> 15:53.412
After the third wish,
what happens then?

15:54.037 --> 15:55.372
I get returned to my bottle,

15:55.455 --> 15:56.915
and then someone else
finds me.

15:56.999 --> 16:00.335
-So you spend your entire life...
-Serving at the pleasure of my masters.

16:01.253 --> 16:02.462
Yes.

16:08.760 --> 16:10.429
What if I wish...

16:10.596 --> 16:11.680
For your freedom?

16:12.222 --> 16:13.432
It's been tried,

16:14.141 --> 16:16.226
and it's never gone well for either party.

16:16.476 --> 16:17.936
Wishes come with a cost, Alice.

16:18.604 --> 16:20.898
The bigger the wish,
the greater the consequence.

16:23.400 --> 16:24.484
Sounds dangerous.

16:24.860 --> 16:27.196
I get the feeling
you like a little danger.

16:27.613 --> 16:30.199
-(CHUCKLES)
-You're still not sure what to wish for.

16:30.532 --> 16:32.284
Perhaps we could...

16:33.535 --> 16:34.953
Take a walk.

16:35.287 --> 16:36.788
I can give you some suggestions.

16:37.581 --> 16:38.832
I'd like that very much.

16:56.767 --> 16:59.269
I must admit, I do enjoy the flying.

16:59.603 --> 17:00.812
You always did.

17:02.648 --> 17:04.066
For what it's worth, Sil,

17:04.900 --> 17:06.527
I enjoyed some of the other bits as well.

17:11.782 --> 17:14.326
Not nearly as much
as I'm going to enjoy this.

17:14.409 --> 17:16.411
-(SCREAMING)
-(GASPS) Will!

17:19.498 --> 17:21.416
I can't tell you how long
I've been waiting for that.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.253
-How could you...
-Trust me. He deserved it.

17:24.336 --> 17:26.171
But we have to get him. He can't swim.

17:26.255 --> 17:27.714
Sorry. No detours.

17:27.798 --> 17:29.591
Oh, bloody hell.

17:30.676 --> 17:32.094
-(GRUNTS)
-(GASPS) Oh.

(ALICE GRUNTING)

18:05.460 --> 18:07.045
What did you do to that fairy?

18:07.129 --> 18:09.506
What did I do to her? She just tossed me
into the bloody lake!

18:09.590 --> 18:11.300
Which you clearly deserved.

18:12.009 --> 18:14.219
Now we're stuck in the middle of nowhere,

18:14.303 --> 18:15.721
all because you broke a fairy's heart.

18:15.846 --> 18:17.973
Well, she shouldn't have given
it away in the first place.

18:18.056 --> 18:20.017
People can't help falling in love, Will.

18:21.101 --> 18:23.854
Sure, they can. You just sneak out
in the middle of the night,

18:23.937 --> 18:26.523
grab your trousers, your keys,
and don't ever look back.

18:26.607 --> 18:27.941
How did you get this way?

18:28.358 --> 18:30.611
-Who did this to you?
-This isn't about me, Alice.

18:31.278 --> 18:33.780
If it were, I'd be sat back at home,
happily watching the telly.

18:34.781 --> 18:36.200
Don't ask.

18:36.742 --> 18:38.368
Look, all I'm trying to tell you is,

18:38.452 --> 18:40.329
you've got this picture
of Cyrus in your mind,

18:40.412 --> 18:42.581
these perfect little memories
of how things were.

18:43.081 --> 18:44.833
But maybe that's just
how they were for you.

18:45.751 --> 18:46.960
It wasn't like that.

18:48.504 --> 18:49.922
And if you really
believe that,

18:50.005 --> 18:51.215
what are we doing here?

18:51.465 --> 18:53.675
This is your quest, Alice, not mine.

18:54.176 --> 18:55.427
I'm in it for the wish,

18:55.802 --> 18:57.513
just like everybody else
looking for a genie.

18:58.180 --> 18:59.723

You seem a little on edge.

19:10.317 --> 19:11.735
Sorry.

19:12.152 --> 19:14.655
Being a genie is a lot like
being a wanted man.

He carries this staff
with the head of a serpent.

What?

Well, let's just hope you never do.

What does he want with you?

What everyone wants. What they don't have.

-No.

This is the closest thing
I've had to freedom in a long time.

19:55.612 --> 19:56.947
I could say the same.

19:57.865 --> 19:59.658
If your home is such a prison,

19:59.741 --> 20:01.243
why make it your mission to return?

20:03.912 --> 20:05.789
(SIGHS) I have nowhere else to go.

20:06.081 --> 20:07.624
You have the whole world, Alice.

to know?

Once. I can't recommend it.

20:25.309 --> 20:27.477
-(GASPS)
-It required some deft swordplay.

20:28.228 --> 20:29.938
I've never been comfortable with a sword.

20:30.022 --> 20:31.523
You've never felt comfortable
with a sword?

20:31.940 --> 20:33.942
Then how have you survived here
all of this time?

20:34.026 --> 20:35.319
There's other ways to fight.

20:36.612 --> 20:39.823
And in Wonderland, you just
have to be...

20:40.407 --> 20:42.034
Creative. (CHUCKLES)

20:42.576 --> 20:44.119
Like this?

20:51.210 --> 20:52.544
It's beautiful.

20:55.380 --> 20:57.216
And it actually smells like a rose.

20:57.299 --> 20:58.634
It's magic paper.

20:59.009 --> 21:00.802
A little something I picked up
on my travels.

21:00.886 --> 21:02.471
You've traveled a lot, I take it.

21:02.721 --> 21:05.098
Indeed. It's the price of many masters.

21:05.641 --> 21:07.226
I'm never in one place very long.

21:07.309 --> 21:09.186

and then they just...

wanting to move on from you.

21:27.079 --> 21:28.413
Amazing.

-Can you teach me?
-An origami lesson shall be yours.

21:34.419 --> 21:35.838
Actually...

21:36.129 --> 21:37.589
I meant the swordplay.

21:50.686 --> 21:52.354
The genie's bottle.

21:52.604 --> 21:54.398
You have knowledge
of its whereabouts.

21:54.481 --> 21:57.985

in our relationship?

21:58.151 --> 21:59.486
How tragic.

21:59.570 --> 22:01.530
This is not a relationship,

22:02.239 --> 22:03.699
and I'm a very busy man.

22:04.366 --> 22:05.617
So you keep saying.

22:06.076 --> 22:08.662
Yet it appears to me that I am
the one doing all the work.

22:09.204 --> 22:11.290
I brought Alice back to Wonderland,

22:12.291 --> 22:14.585
and I found out where
the bottle is hidden.

22:14.668 --> 22:16.044
Where?

22:16.128 --> 22:18.422
I'm happy to share that
information with you, Jafar.

22:19.298 --> 22:21.425
But first, I feel like
we need a little chat.

22:22.676 --> 22:24.219
I have needs.

22:25.679 --> 22:28.265
Before I am happy to play
another hand in the game,

22:28.807 --> 22:32.227
I need proof that you can satisfy them.

22:43.155 --> 22:45.157
What you need,
my girl...

22:47.201 --> 22:48.744
Is to be quiet.

22:50.037 --> 22:51.997
What you need...

22:52.789 --> 22:54.249
Is to be still.

22:55.834 --> 22:58.212
Silent. Follow orders.

22:59.087 --> 23:02.341
Most of all, be grateful for the air
I'm allowing you to breathe.

23:02.799 --> 23:04.301
We're not partners.

23:05.052 --> 23:06.553
I don't owe you anything.

23:07.763 --> 23:09.431
I have given you my word,

23:10.265 --> 23:12.935
and that is more than most ever receive.
Is that clear?

23:15.521 --> 23:16.730
Oh.

23:16.813 --> 23:18.232
Let me help you with that.

23:19.441 --> 23:21.401

We make a wonderful team.

We're never gonna make it there.

23:49.137 --> 23:50.597
It's miles and miles away.

23:50.973 --> 23:53.809
True. This is a bit of a setback,
I'll give you that.

But I'm sure we'll find
another way.

No, that's not a wish.

Now all you have to do
is learn how to use it.

25:40.249 --> 25:42.209
Well done. Now loosen your grip.

25:42.793 --> 25:44.795
You're holding it like a street fighter.

25:49.091 --> 25:51.844
Better. Have you always been
such a quick study?

25:51.927 --> 25:54.680
I learned how to play Mozart's

Amazing. How?

I thought if I learnt to play like her,

26:05.732 --> 26:07.234
it would make my father happy.

26:07.317 --> 26:08.443
Did it?

26:08.569 --> 26:11.738
It's hard to be happy again
when you've lost someone you love.

26:12.614 --> 26:13.866
Sorry.

26:14.241 --> 26:15.325
(SIGHS) I didn't mean to.

26:15.409 --> 26:16.535
Don't be.

26:18.912 --> 26:20.163
(CHUCKLES)

26:21.957 --> 26:24.251
(GASPS) Hey!

26:27.045 --> 26:28.255
(GASPS) What do I do now?

26:28.505 --> 26:30.007
Same thing you've always done.

26:30.174 --> 26:31.592
Be creative.

26:31.675 --> 26:33.177
(GASPS)

26:33.760 --> 26:36.680
It's hard to be creative when your
opponent's uncommonly creative, too.

26:36.889 --> 26:39.474
Well, I suppose the trick is to always
be smarter than your opponent.

26:39.808 --> 26:42.352
Which means you have to know
who you're up against.

26:43.020 --> 26:44.521
I'll remember that.

26:45.731 --> 26:47.983
So, Alice, what now?

26:48.817 --> 26:50.444
I think I know my opponent.

26:50.569 --> 26:51.862
I think I know his weakness.

26:52.029 --> 26:53.113
Really?

26:53.906 --> 26:55.324
I hope so.

27:00.829 --> 27:02.331
Looks like I was right.

(BOTH CHUCKLE)

27:17.721 --> 27:19.014
What are you waiting for?

27:19.139 --> 27:21.642
I nearly drowned and was
eaten by a mock turtle.

27:22.267 --> 27:24.019
Can I have a moment, please?

27:24.770 --> 27:26.230
-(SIGHS)
-SILVERMIST: Nope.

27:27.648 --> 27:29.024
-You again?
-I'm actually glad

27:29.107 --> 27:30.275
to see you alive, Knave.

27:30.359 --> 27:32.778
That's strange, since you're
the one that tried to kill me.

27:32.861 --> 27:34.988
That was before I heard about
the bounty on your head.

27:35.489 --> 27:37.658
Turns out you're in pretty
deep to the Caterpillar.

27:38.784 --> 27:41.870
Okay, look. I made a horrible mistake.

27:42.538 --> 27:44.498
The thing is, you were
right about everything.

27:44.581 --> 27:46.917
I felt bloody awful
after what happened between us.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.503
If you ever had a heart,
I don't know what happened to it.

27:50.212 --> 27:53.841
But then again, maybe your precious
Anastasia used it all up.

27:56.677 --> 27:58.095
You're right.

27:58.303 --> 27:59.763
I don't feel terrible.

28:00.430 --> 28:01.723
Not even a little bit.

28:02.683 --> 28:04.852
But that's because I don't feel
much of anything anymore.

28:06.186 --> 28:07.646
So why don't we both agree

28:07.729 --> 28:10.065
that I'm a right bastard
and go our separate ways?

28:10.774 --> 28:12.568
We don't need to bring
the Caterpillar into this.

28:13.110 --> 28:15.612
-Why should I care about your fate?
-You shouldn't.

28:15.737 --> 28:16.947
But care about hers.

28:17.906 --> 28:20.784
She's a decent person, and so is
the man that she loves,

28:21.118 --> 28:23.787
whose life is literally hanging
in the balance as we speak.

28:24.705 --> 28:27.666
Don't make the good guys pay
for the bad guys' mistakes.

28:29.626 --> 28:32.045
I am sorry, Silvermist.
For everything.

28:38.719 --> 28:39.970
Be on with you, then.

28:40.846 --> 28:42.514
-Really?
-Get out of here. Go.

28:48.729 --> 28:50.189
Was that you apologizing?

28:50.439 --> 28:52.024
It happens. Don't dwell on it.

28:52.357 --> 28:53.442
Come on.

28:54.735 --> 28:56.111
So who's Anastasia?

28:56.236 --> 28:57.571
Nobody.

28:58.030 --> 28:59.990
Well, in any case, thank you.

29:05.120 --> 29:07.372
(BIRDS CHIRPING)

29:15.756 --> 29:17.299
Good morning.

29:17.382 --> 29:19.218
All the mornings are good
since I've met you.

29:25.724 --> 29:27.142
So what should we do
today?

29:28.018 --> 29:30.479
You mentioned that place, the Boiling Sea.

29:30.562 --> 29:32.105
-I've always wanted to...
-Alice.

29:33.941 --> 29:35.400
I think it's time.

29:36.068 --> 29:37.986
-For what?
-For you to make your wishes.

29:44.451 --> 29:45.661
Did I do something wrong?

29:46.203 --> 29:47.412
No.

29:47.746 --> 29:49.998
In fact, I can't imagine you
ever doing anything wrong.

29:52.209 --> 29:53.502
Which is the problem.

29:54.169 --> 29:55.504
I don't understand.

29:56.421 --> 29:58.465
I'm falling in love with you, Alice.

30:00.801 --> 30:03.178
-Cyrus...
-I can't allow that to happen.

30:03.762 --> 30:05.138
Because at some point, you're going to

30:05.222 --> 30:07.391
make your wishes
and move on with your life.

30:07.558 --> 30:11.645
And while I've gotten used to being alone
inside this bottle for years at a time,

30:12.145 --> 30:14.481
the thought of spending
an eternity there without you...

30:15.816 --> 30:17.234
It's too much for me to bear.

30:17.359 --> 30:19.444
But if I don't make my wishes,

30:19.528 --> 30:21.238
you'll never go back inside.

30:21.321 --> 30:22.781
Everyone makes their wishes.

30:22.906 --> 30:24.908
-I won't.
-You say that now,

30:25.409 --> 30:28.745
but I've lived countless lifetimes
and no one has ever not made their wishes.

30:28.871 --> 30:30.581
Why would I wish for anything?

30:31.206 --> 30:33.876
I have everything I could
possibly wish for.

30:34.585 --> 30:38.297
You are everything
I've ever wished for, Cyrus.

30:39.256 --> 30:40.632
What if you change your mind?

30:40.716 --> 30:42.759
-I won't.
-But what if you do?

30:43.385 --> 30:45.095
You just have to trust me.

30:49.057 --> 30:50.350
How about we make a deal?

30:52.644 --> 30:54.521
I'll never move on from you

-Never was.

32:12.641 --> 32:16.186
Then, um... Then, then why are we here?

and now I do.

telling everybody where we're headed.

32:24.403 --> 32:26.029
The one thing you can count on

is that you can't count on anyone.

You didn't tell me
the bloody truth, either.

32:42.880 --> 32:44.464
Does that mean you don't trust me?

32:45.924 --> 32:47.176
Well...

32:47.259 --> 32:49.553
If it helps, I do now.

coming with me.

to earn your respect,

do not talk down to me anymore!

You see, I was planning on telling you
where the bottle was hidden.

35:35.594 --> 35:38.347
And then I realized something.
I don't trust you.

35:39.306 --> 35:40.807
And the reason I don't trust you, because

35:40.891 --> 35:43.560
this relationship is not
mutually beneficial.

40:03.862 --> 40:05.656
And now it's happening again.

40:17.918 --> 40:21.338
(FLUTTERING)

40:31.390 --> 40:34.226
What the bloody hell is that?

40:37.980 --> 40:40.107
(PAPER RUSTLING)

40:43.318 --> 40:44.987
Proof.

40:48.448 --> 40:50.117
-(CHUCKLES)
-CYRUS: <i>My dearest Alice,</i>

40:51.243 --> 40:53.078
<i>It took several lifetimes to meet you,</i>

40:53.203 --> 40:54.746
<i>but only seconds to love you.</i>

40:55.664 --> 40:57.958
<i>And it is a love that cannot be broken.</i>

40:59.126 --> 41:01.503
<i>Not by a thousand spells</i>
<i>or swords.</i>

41:02.629 --> 41:04.923
<i>So it is with my heart in your hands...</i>

41:05.048 --> 41:07.134
-(KEY TURNS)
<i>-...that I ask you grant me one wish.</i>

41:07.968 --> 41:09.303
<i>Leave Wonderland.</i>

41:12.139 --> 41:13.640
<i>You're not safe here,</i>

41:14.141 --> 41:15.642
<i>and you cannot save me.</i>

41:17.311 --> 41:21.190
<i>The only thing worse than my own demise</i>
<i>would be knowing that I have caused yours.</i>

41:28.906 --> 41:30.407
<i>I beg you to go home.</i>

41:31.408 --> 41:33.452
<i>And know that I am with you always.</i>

41:34.286 --> 41:37.080
<i>Forever thine, forever mine...</i>

41:38.123 --> 41:40.417
<i>Cyrus.</i>

41:42.961 --> 41:44.588
He's alive.

41:44.713 --> 41:49.092
I thought when you truly loved somebody,
you didn't need any proof.

41:49.801 --> 41:51.303
You don't,

41:51.428 --> 41:53.013
but it's still nice to have.

41:57.851 --> 42:00.020
