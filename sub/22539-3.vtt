We were born into a mystery...</i>

01:41.852 --> 01:45.823
<i>...one that has haunted us since
at least as long as we've been human.</i>

01:48.567 --> 01:54.165
<i>We awakened on this tiny world
beneath a blanket of stars...</i>

01:54.781 --> 01:57.625
<i>...like an abandoned baby
left on a doorstep...</i>

01:57.784 --> 02:02.665
<i>...without a note to explain
where we came from, who we are...</i>

02:03.165 --> 02:05.964
<i>...how our universe came to be...</i>

02:06.126 --> 02:10.381
<i>...and with no idea
how to end our cosmic isolation.</i>

02:10.881 --> 02:15.227
<i>We've had to figure it
all out for ourselves.</i>

02:19.723 --> 02:23.227
Best thing we had going for us
was our intelligence...

02:23.393 --> 02:26.943
...especially our gift for
pattern recognition...

02:27.105 --> 02:29.233
...sharpened over eons of evolution.

02:30.067 --> 02:33.071
The ones who were good
at spotting prey and predator...

02:33.236 --> 02:35.955
...telling poisonous plants
from the nourishing ones...

02:36.114 --> 02:39.163
...had a better chance
to live and reproduce.

02:39.326 --> 02:42.751
They survived and passed on those genes
for pattern recognition...

02:42.913 --> 02:44.915
...with its obvious advantages.

02:45.374 --> 02:49.880
<i>Cultures all over the planet
looked up at the same stars...</i>

02:50.045 --> 02:53.470
<i>...and found different pictures there.</i>

02:59.596 --> 03:02.566
We used this gift
for recognizing patterns in nature...

03:02.724 --> 03:05.978
...to read the calendar in the sky.

03:08.146 --> 03:12.401
<i>The messages written in the stars
told our forefathers and mothers...</i>

03:12.567 --> 03:15.491
<i>...when to camp and when to move on...</i>

03:15.654 --> 03:19.124
<i>...when the migratory herds and when
the rains and the cold would come...</i>

03:19.282 --> 03:21.410
<i>...and when they would cease for a time.</i>

03:21.576 --> 03:24.796
<i>When they observed the connection
between the motions of the stars...</i>

03:24.955 --> 03:27.083
<i>...and the seasonal cycles
of life on Earth...</i>

03:27.249 --> 03:30.549
<i>...they concluded, naturally,
that what happens up there...</i>

03:30.711 --> 03:33.385
<i>...must be directed at us down here.</i>

03:33.547 --> 03:35.015
<i>It makes sense, right?</i>

03:35.173 --> 03:39.428
<i>If the sky was a calendar and somebody
stuck a Post-it note on top of it...</i>

03:39.594 --> 03:42.939
<i>...what else could it be but a message?</i>

03:43.640 --> 03:46.314
<i>And so when the heavenly order
was suddenly violated...</i>

03:46.476 --> 03:51.403
...by the apparition of a comet in the sky,
they took it personally.

03:51.565 --> 03:53.317
Can we really blame them?

03:53.483 --> 03:57.488
Back then, they had no other logical
explanation for what was happening.

03:57.654 --> 04:00.578
This was long before
anyone had yet to imagine Earth...

04:00.741 --> 04:04.666
...as a spinning planet with a tilted axis,
revolving around the sun.

04:04.828 --> 04:08.583
Every ancient human culture
made the same mistake:

04:08.749 --> 04:13.505
The comet must be a message
sent by the gods, or one particular god.

04:13.670 --> 04:20.678
And almost invariably our ancestors
concluded the news was not good.

04:20.844 --> 04:27.853
<i>It didn't matter if you were an ancient
Aztec, Anglo-Saxon, Babylonian, Hindu.</i>

04:28.185 --> 04:31.485
<i>Comets were portents of doom.</i>

04:31.646 --> 04:37.198
<i>The only difference among them was the
precise nature of the coming disaster.</i>

04:37.360 --> 04:42.116
<i>"Disaster," as in the
Greek word for "bad star."</i>

04:42.282 --> 04:45.707
<i>To the Masai of East Africa,
a comet meant famine.</i>

04:45.869 --> 04:48.748
<i>To the Zulu in the south, it meant war.</i>

04:48.914 --> 04:52.384
<i>To the Eghap people of the west,
it meant disease.</i>

04:52.542 --> 04:57.218
<i>To the Djaga of Zaire,
specifically smallpox.</i>

04:57.380 --> 05:03.103
<i>To their neighbors, the Lube,
a comet foretold the death of a leader.</i>

05:03.261 --> 05:06.891
<i>The ancient Chinese
were remarkably systematic.</i>

05:07.974 --> 05:10.568
<i>Starting in roughly 1400 BC...</i>

05:10.727 --> 05:14.857
<i>...they began recording and cataloging
the apparitions of comets.</i>

05:15.023 --> 05:18.277
<i>A three-tailed comet
meant calamity for the state.</i>

05:18.443 --> 05:22.493
<i>A four-tailed comet
signified an epidemic was coming.</i>

05:22.656 --> 05:26.786
<i>The human talent for pattern recognition
is a two-edged sword.</i>

05:26.952 --> 05:32.083
<i>We're especially good at finding patterns
even when they aren't really there...</i>

05:32.249 --> 05:36.220
<i>...something known as
"false pattern recognition."</i>

05:38.880 --> 05:41.008
We hunger for significance...

05:41.174 --> 05:46.772
...for signs that our personal existence
is of special meaning to the universe.

05:48.557 --> 05:53.063
To that end, we're all too eager
to deceive ourselves and others...

05:53.228 --> 05:56.277
...to discern a sacred image
in a grilled cheese sandwich...

05:56.439 --> 05:59.613
...or find a divine warning in a comet.

05:59.776 --> 06:02.279
Today we know exactly
where comets come from...

06:02.445 --> 06:04.948
...and what they're made of.

06:07.450 --> 06:09.418
<i><font color="#808080">TYSON :</font>
Our Ship of the Imagination...</i>

06:09.578 --> 06:13.128
<i>...fueled by equal parts
of science and wonder...</i>

06:13.290 --> 06:17.090
<i>...can take us anywhere in space and time.</i>

06:17.252 --> 06:18.925
<i>It can travel faster than light...</i>

06:19.087 --> 06:22.808
<i>...and render visible those things
that cannot be seen.</i>

06:22.966 --> 06:28.689
<i>It's carrying us to a mysterious realm
that lies one light-year from the sun.</i>

06:28.847 --> 06:31.145
<i>What is this swarm of worlds?</i>

06:31.308 --> 06:33.652
<i>Was it organized by alien beings?</i>

06:33.810 --> 06:36.438
<i>No, just gravity.</i>

06:36.605 --> 06:38.983
These are the snows of yesteryear.

06:39.149 --> 06:41.948
Drifting mountains of ice and rock.

06:42.110 --> 06:44.989
The preserved remnants
of the birth of the solar system.

06:45.155 --> 06:48.534
It's called the Oort
cloud, after Jan Oort...

06:48.700 --> 06:53.251
...the Dutch astronomer who
foretold its existence back in 1950.

06:53.413 --> 06:55.586
He was trying to solve a paradox.

06:55.749 --> 06:59.003
There's so many ways for comets to die.

06:59.169 --> 07:03.515
Because they cross the orbits of planets,
comets frequently collide with them.

07:04.507 --> 07:08.307
Comets are largely made of ice,
so every time they come near the sun...

07:08.470 --> 07:11.474
<i>...they lose a part of themselves
through evaporation.</i>

07:11.640 --> 07:15.816
<i>And after several thousand trips,
their ice is all gone...</i>

07:15.977 --> 07:18.696
...and what remains of the comet
is now an asteroid.

07:18.855 --> 07:21.825
Comets can be gravitationally
ejected from the solar system...

07:21.983 --> 07:23.576
...and exiled into space.

07:23.735 --> 07:27.660
And yet somehow the comets keep coming.

07:27.822 --> 07:32.043
Oort and other astronomers wondered,
"Where do all the comets come from?"

07:34.412 --> 07:37.291
<i>Oort calculated the rate
at which new comets appear...</i>

07:37.457 --> 07:41.507
<i>...and concluded that there must
be a vast spherical swarm of them...</i>

07:41.670 --> 07:45.766
<i>...a few light-years across,
surrounding the sun.</i>

07:48.969 --> 07:50.892
Oort's logic still holds up...

07:51.054 --> 07:53.807
...even after all the discoveries
we've made about comets...

07:53.974 --> 07:56.648
...and the solar system
in the many decades since.

07:56.810 --> 08:02.533
And yet the Oort cloud is a sight
that no one has ever seen.

08:02.941 --> 08:05.945
Nor could we. It's dark out here.

08:06.111 --> 08:09.115
And each comet is about as far
from its closest neighbor...

08:09.280 --> 08:11.157
...as the Earth is from Saturn.

08:11.324 --> 08:14.578
But science gives us
special powers of our own.

08:14.744 --> 08:18.339
It gave Jan Oort the gift of prophecy.

08:18.498 --> 08:21.047
Oort was also the first
to correctly estimate...

08:21.209 --> 08:24.258
...the distance between the sun
and the center of our galaxy.

08:24.921 --> 08:28.596
That's a big deal, finding out
where we are in the Milky Way.

08:28.758 --> 08:33.104
<i>Our star is about
30,000 light-years from the center.</i>

08:33.263 --> 08:35.937
Oort was also the first guy
to use a radio telescope...

08:36.099 --> 08:38.397
...to map the galaxy's spiral structure.

08:38.977 --> 08:44.859
<i>And he discovered that the center of our
galaxy was a place of titanic explosions...</i>

08:45.025 --> 08:47.374
...the first indication
that there might have

08:47.386 --> 08:49.747
been a supermassive black
hole lurking there.

08:49.904 --> 08:52.953
Does the fact that most of us know
the names of mass murderers...

08:53.116 --> 08:57.747
...but have never heard of Jan Oort,
say anything about us?

09:06.880 --> 09:08.974
<i>The Oort cloud is so enormous...</i>

09:09.132 --> 09:12.102
<i>...that it takes one of its comets
about a million years...</i>

09:12.260 --> 09:15.935
<i>...to complete a single
trip around the sun.</i>

09:17.974 --> 09:20.602
<i>Out here at the far edge
of the solar system...</i>

09:20.769 --> 09:23.864
<i>...even a little tug from
the gravity of a passing star...</i>

09:24.022 --> 09:29.370
<i>...can liberate some of these comets from
their gravitational bondage to the sun.</i>

09:32.655 --> 09:37.001
Some comets are flung out of the solar
system to wander interstellar space.

09:37.160 --> 09:40.790
But for others there's a different fate.

09:47.003 --> 09:51.850
<i>This one is plunging towards the sun,
gaining speed in an unbroken free fall...</i>

09:52.008 --> 09:55.262
<i>...that lasts hundreds
of thousands of years.</i>

09:56.096 --> 10:02.024
<i>When Neptune's gravity gives it another
tug, there's a small change in course.</i>

10:02.185 --> 10:06.235
Mighty Jupiter, the most massive object
in our solar system other than the sun...

10:06.397 --> 10:09.742
...attracts the comet
with its powerful gravitational pull...

10:09.901 --> 10:12.370
...bending its path.

10:15.323 --> 10:19.544
<i>When our comet reaches
the inner solar system...</i>

10:20.995 --> 10:24.625
<i>...heat from the sun bakes it.</i>

10:32.340 --> 10:35.594
<i>A beautiful transformation begins.</i>

10:35.760 --> 10:41.062
<i>The barren, sooty iceberg
now sports a glowing halo...</i>

10:41.891 --> 10:43.893
<i>...and a tail.</i>

10:50.733 --> 10:53.703
These layers tell the story
of how the comet was made...

10:53.862 --> 10:56.991
...some 4 billion years ago.

11:01.286 --> 11:04.256
<i>During the 40,000
generations of humanity...</i>

11:04.414 --> 11:09.716
<i>...there must have been roughly
100,000 apparitions of a bright comet.</i>

11:10.211 --> 11:15.593
<i>For all that time, the best we could do
was look up in helpless wonder...</i>

11:15.758 --> 11:18.932
<i>...prisoners of Earth with nowhere to turn
for an explanation...</i>

11:19.095 --> 11:22.019
<i>...beyond our guilt and our fears.</i>

11:22.932 --> 11:26.106
But then a friendship began
between two men...

11:26.269 --> 11:30.149
...that led to a permanent revolution
in human thought.

11:31.149 --> 11:34.244
<i>Isaac Newton and Edmond Halley
could not know it...</i>

11:34.402 --> 11:37.781
<i>...but their collaboration
would ultimately set us free...</i>

11:37.947 --> 11:42.623
<i>...from our long confinement
on this tiny world.</i>

11:48.958 --> 11:53.714
<i><font color="#808080">TYSON :</font> The comet of 1664
sent shivers of dread throughout Europe.</i>

11:53.880 --> 11:56.099
<i>And the terror seemed justified...</i>

11:56.257 --> 11:59.978
<i>...when the plague and the Great
Fire of London followed soon after.</i>

12:01.429 --> 12:04.683
<i><font color="#808080">WOMAN :</font>
There, with long bloody hair...</i>

12:04.849 --> 12:08.524
<i>...a blazing star threatens the world...</i>

12:08.686 --> 12:13.658
<i>...with famine, plague and war.</i>

12:14.525 --> 12:17.699
<i>To princes, it spells death.</i>

12:18.321 --> 12:21.450
<i>To kingdoms, many crosses.</i>

12:22.825 --> 12:25.999
<i>To all estates, inevitable losses.</i>

12:26.871 --> 12:28.839
<i>To herdsmen, rot.</i>

12:28.998 --> 12:31.501
<i>To plowmen, hapless seasons.</i>

12:32.585 --> 12:36.089
<i>To sailors, it brings storms.</i>

12:37.632 --> 12:41.682
<i>To cities, civil treasons.</i>

12:47.517 --> 12:48.814
<i><font color="#808080">TYSON :</font>
But for one child...</i>

12:49.686 --> 12:52.690
<i>...the comet was not the
least bit frightening.</i>

12:57.694 --> 13:01.198
<i>For him, it was a thing of wonder.</i>

13:01.364 --> 13:05.244
<i>Like all of us,
Edmond Halley was born curious.</i>

13:05.410 --> 13:07.128
<font color="#808080">HALLEY :</font> Hell's bells.

13:07.996 --> 13:12.001
<i><font color="#808080">TYSON :</font> He was lucky to have a father who
encouraged and nurtured his curiosity...</i>

13:12.166 --> 13:14.265
<i>...buying him the best
scientific instruments,</i>

13:14.277 --> 13:16.387
<i>and even funding
his expedition...</i>

13:16.546 --> 13:20.221
<i>...to make the first accurate star map
of the Southern Hemisphere.</i>

13:20.383 --> 13:24.229
<i>Halley dropped out of Oxford when he was 20
and sailed to St. Helena...</i>

13:24.387 --> 13:27.311
<i>...an island below the equator,
off the west coast of Africa.</i>

13:33.730 --> 13:36.074
Hell's bells.

13:36.232 --> 13:39.406
<i><font color="#808080">TYSON :</font> Problem was, nobody told Halley
that the weather on St. Helena...</i>

13:39.569 --> 13:43.369
<i>...was generally lousy.
It took him 12 frustrating months...</i>

13:43.531 --> 13:48.082
<i>...to observe enough southern stars
to make a complete map.</i>

13:48.870 --> 13:50.964
<i>The gods and heroes of ancient Greece...</i>

13:51.122 --> 13:55.298
<i>...were now joined by the mythic figures
of a new world and age:</i>

13:55.460 --> 14:00.387
<i>a toucan, a compass, a bird of paradise.</i>

14:08.306 --> 14:10.934
When Halley came home
with the other half of the sky...

14:11.100 --> 14:13.228
...his map created a sensation.

14:13.394 --> 14:16.193
Now merchants and explorers
could navigate by the stars...

14:16.356 --> 14:18.074
...visible anywhere on Earth.

14:18.232 --> 14:20.451
At the time,
the Royal Society of London...

14:20.610 --> 14:23.363
...was the world's clearinghouse
of scientific discovery.

14:23.529 --> 14:28.911
Its motto, "Nullius in verba,"
sums up the heart of the scientific method.

14:29.077 --> 14:31.921
It's Latin for "see for yourself."

14:32.080 --> 14:35.584
In other words, question authority.

14:35.750 --> 14:39.800
Halley's star maps caught the attention
of the Society's curator of experiments.

14:39.962 --> 14:42.226
I'd show him to you if I
could, but no portrait

14:42.238 --> 14:44.513
of Robert Hooke exists
from his time...

14:44.675 --> 14:47.303
...only the verbal descriptions
of his contemporaries.

14:47.470 --> 14:50.644
They called him "lean, bent, ugly."

14:50.807 --> 14:53.981
He was possibly the most
inventive person who ever lived.

14:54.143 --> 14:58.899
And despite his appearance, he was the most
sought-after party guest in all of London.

14:59.065 --> 15:05.823
Why? Hooke's insatiable curiosity
encompassed absolutely everything.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.743
<i>Hooke discovered a little cosmos...</i>

15:09.909 --> 15:14.164
<i>...and we still call it
by the name he gave it: the cell.</i>

15:14.330 --> 15:16.429
<i>Hooke discovered the
cell by looking at a</i>

15:16.441 --> 15:18.551
<i>piece of cork with one
of his own inventions:</i>

15:18.709 --> 15:20.336
<i>the compound microscope.</i>

15:20.962 --> 15:26.765
<i>He anticipated aspects of Darwin's
theory of evolution by almost 200 years.</i>

15:26.926 --> 15:28.849
<i>Hooke also improved the telescope.</i>

15:29.011 --> 15:31.890
<i>The drawings he made of the
astronomical bodies he observed...</i>

15:32.056 --> 15:34.400
<i>...attest to his uncanny precision.</i>

15:34.559 --> 15:38.530
<i>After the Great Fire
destroyed central London in 1666...</i>

15:38.688 --> 15:41.316
<i>...Hooke partnered with the architect
Christopher Wren...</i>

15:41.482 --> 15:43.155
<i>...to redesign and rebuild the city.</i>

15:43.901 --> 15:48.031
<i>Hooke was the foremost
experimentalist of his age.</i>

15:48.197 --> 15:51.576
<i>Using coiled springs,
he derived the law of elasticity...</i>

15:51.742 --> 15:54.461
<i>...known today as Hooke's law.</i>

15:54.620 --> 15:58.500
<i>He perfected the air pump,
the height of technology in its time...</i>

15:58.666 --> 16:02.512
<i>...and used it to experiment
on respiration and sound.</i>

16:02.670 --> 16:05.423
<i>And he experimented with cannabis.</i>

16:05.590 --> 16:07.843
<i>He reported to a meeting
of the Royal Society...</i>

16:08.009 --> 16:12.765
<i>...that a sea captain friend of his, quote,
"had so often experimented with it...</i>

16:12.930 --> 16:18.482
<i>...that there is no cause of fear,
though possibly there may be of laughter."</i>

16:22.106 --> 16:26.361
But coffee was the drug of choice
for England in the 17th century.

16:26.527 --> 16:29.121
Coffeehouses sprang up
all over London.

16:29.280 --> 16:30.623
<font color="#D900D9">(INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE)</font>

16:41.292 --> 16:43.761
This is where people came to get news...

16:43.920 --> 16:46.764
...to launch new ventures,
and to debate ideas.

16:47.256 --> 16:52.763
The coffeehouse was an oasis of equality
in a class-obsessed society.

16:53.262 --> 16:58.063
Here a poor man needn't give up his seat
to a rich man, nor submit to his opinion.

16:58.226 --> 17:00.604
It was a kind of laboratory of democracy.

17:01.229 --> 17:03.277
In this highly caffeinated atmosphere...

17:04.065 --> 17:08.662
...Halley and Hooke met Christopher Wren
to discuss a deep mystery:

17:08.819 --> 17:11.823
Why do the planets move as they do?

17:11.989 --> 17:15.539
The astronomer Johannes Kepler
had demonstrated some 80 years before...

17:16.077 --> 17:18.421
<i>...that the orbits of the planets
around the sun...</i>

17:18.579 --> 17:21.752
<i>...were not perfect circles,
but actually ellipses...</i>

17:21.915 --> 17:27.763
<i>...and that the closer a planet
was to the sun, the faster it moved.</i>

17:28.714 --> 17:31.456
Why? Could some invisible
force from the sun

17:31.468 --> 17:34.221
be responsible for
this change in motion?

17:34.387 --> 17:36.264
If so, how did it work?

17:36.430 --> 17:39.309
Could there be a simple
mathematical law to describe it?

17:39.475 --> 17:43.230
Maybe something like
Hooke's law of elasticity?

17:47.275 --> 17:48.492
<i>Perhaps.</i>

17:48.651 --> 17:52.872
<i>But try as he might,
Christopher Wren couldn't figure it out.</i>

17:53.030 --> 17:55.783
Damned if I haven't tried. It's beyond me.

17:55.950 --> 17:59.329
I'll wager a book worth 40 shillings
to the man who can solve it.

17:59.495 --> 18:02.999
<font color="#808080">HOOKE :</font> That book is mine, Mr. Wren.
I've already done the calculation.

18:03.165 --> 18:04.257
<i><font color="#808080">TYSON :</font>
Halley was delighted.</i>

18:04.417 --> 18:05.964
Show us, Mr. Hooke.

18:06.127 --> 18:09.472
<i><font color="#808080">TYSON :</font> But months passed,
and Hooke failed to deliver.</i>

18:09.630 --> 18:11.348
<i>He couldn't do the math.</i>

18:11.507 --> 18:12.633
<i>None of them could.</i>

18:12.800 --> 18:15.724
<i>Finally Halley had enough
of Hooke's excuses.</i>

18:15.886 --> 18:20.642
<i>Halley knew there must be someone,
somewhere, up to the challenge.</i>

18:27.356 --> 18:30.200
What about that mathematician
at Cambridge?

18:30.359 --> 18:31.702
He was a clever fellow.

18:31.861 --> 18:35.456
He had solved central questions
about the nature of light years before...

18:35.615 --> 18:37.709
...when he was still only 22.

18:37.867 --> 18:40.370
And he invented the reflecting telescope.

18:40.536 --> 18:43.710
Odd bird.
Dropped out of sight a while back.

18:43.873 --> 18:47.047
Some squabble over Hooke
and his discovery about light.

18:47.209 --> 18:51.009
Went completely to pieces over it, has
been hiding out in Cambridge ever since.

18:51.172 --> 18:55.803
Halley wondered if this strange and, by all
accounts, exceedingly difficult man...

18:55.968 --> 18:58.972
...might succeed where Hooke
and others had failed.

18:59.138 --> 19:02.859
What he couldn't know, what no one
could possibly imagine at the time...

19:03.017 --> 19:07.067
...were the countless ways the world
would be forever changed by this meeting...

19:07.229 --> 19:11.154
...on an August day in 1684.

19:19.283 --> 19:23.584
<i><font color="#808080">TYSON :</font> Isaac Newton was born in England

19:38.052 --> 19:41.101
<i><font color="#808080">TYSON :</font> When she did,
it was with a new family and husband...</i>

19:41.263 --> 19:45.359
<i>...a stepfather who Isaac Newton despised.</i>

19:49.397 --> 19:52.241
<i>Newton's refuge
from his miserable family life...</i>

19:52.400 --> 19:55.870
<i>...was his passion
to understand how things worked...</i>

19:56.028 --> 19:59.202
<i>...especially nature itself.</i>

19:59.365 --> 20:04.713
<i>In 1661 the talented young Isaac entered
Trinity College at Cambridge University...</i>

20:04.870 --> 20:08.249
<i>...where he was a consistently
lousy student...</i>

20:08.416 --> 20:13.297
<i>...one without friends or a loving family
to provide any warmth or encouragement.</i>

20:13.462 --> 20:16.966
<i>Newton mostly kept to himself,
sequestered in his room...</i>

20:17.133 --> 20:21.639
<i>...studying ancient Greek philosophers,
geometry and languages...</i>

20:21.804 --> 20:28.312
<i>...and pondering deep questions on the
nature of matter, space, time and motion.</i>

20:28.644 --> 20:32.740
<i>This budding scientist
was also a passionate mystic.</i>

20:32.898 --> 20:35.993
<i>Newton believed that a secret knowledge
called alchemy...</i>

20:36.152 --> 20:39.452
<i>...known only to a small group
of ancient philosophers...</i>

20:39.613 --> 20:41.286
<i>...was waiting to be rediscovered.</i>

20:41.991 --> 20:46.497
<i>He hoped to learn how to change
ordinary metals into silver and gold...</i>

20:46.662 --> 20:51.964
<i>...and maybe even cook up the elixir
of life, the key to immortality.</i>

20:53.210 --> 20:58.216
<i>He was also obsessed with finding
hidden messages in the words of the Bible.</i>

20:59.592 --> 21:02.892
<i>He combed through translations
in several different languages...</i>

21:03.053 --> 21:07.854
<i>...hoping to decipher
coded instructions from God.</i>

21:12.688 --> 21:17.319
<i>He made elaborate calculations in an effort
to discover the date of the Second Coming.</i>

21:19.361 --> 21:25.619
<i>His lifelong research in alchemy
and biblical chronology never led anywhere.</i>

21:29.413 --> 21:36.217
<i>When Halley found Newton that fateful day,
he was living as a virtual recluse.</i>

21:38.756 --> 21:42.056
<i>Newton had gone into hiding
13 years earlier...</i>

21:42.218 --> 21:44.892
<i>...after Robert Hooke had publicly
accused Newton...</i>

21:45.054 --> 21:48.854
<i>...of stealing his groundbreaking work
on light and color.</i>

21:49.016 --> 21:53.613
<i>In fact, it was Isaac Newton who solved
the mystery of the spectrum of light...</i>

21:53.771 --> 21:55.739
<i>...not Robert Hooke.</i>

21:55.898 --> 21:57.821
<i>The wound was painful and deep...</i>

21:57.983 --> 22:00.452
<i>...and Newton resolved to never
expose himself...</i>

22:00.611 --> 22:04.206
<i>...to that kind of public humiliation
ever again.</i>

22:04.365 --> 22:08.120
Sir, I don't suppose you recall
our meeting a few years ago?

22:08.285 --> 22:10.003
Yes, Mr. Halley.

22:10.162 --> 22:11.664
I'm sorry to bother you.

22:11.831 --> 22:14.380
Never mind the formalities.
Get to your point.

22:14.542 --> 22:17.591
I've been talking with our friends
Mr. Wren and Mr. Hooke.

22:17.753 --> 22:20.677
That scoundrel Hooke's no friend of mine.

22:20.840 --> 22:22.467
Yes, I understand, sir.

22:22.633 --> 22:27.434
But the thing is, we've been debating
the puzzling question of planetary motion.

22:27.596 --> 22:29.820
We all agree that some
force of attraction from

22:29.832 --> 22:32.067
the sun governs the
motions of the planets.

22:32.226 --> 22:34.979
We suspect there must be
a mathematical law...

22:35.145 --> 22:38.740
...to describe how this force
changes with distance.

22:38.899 --> 22:40.242
And knowing of your skill--

22:40.401 --> 22:44.122
Yes, yes, the attraction of gravity
weakens with the square of the distance.

22:44.280 --> 22:46.624
That's why the planets move in ellipses.

22:46.782 --> 22:49.285
But, sir, how can you know this?

22:49.451 --> 22:52.204
Why, I have calculated it
some five years ago.

22:52.371 --> 22:55.090
I beg you, show it to me.

22:55.249 --> 22:58.469
The calculation is here somewhere.

22:58.627 --> 23:02.097
Well, no matter. I shall redo it
and be sure to send it on to you.

23:02.256 --> 23:06.978
This is stupendous. Why have
we not had word of it before?

23:07.136 --> 23:10.310
<i><font color="#808080">TYSON :</font> Newton remembered all too well
what Hooke had done to him...</i>

23:10.472 --> 23:13.601
<i>...the last time he put forth an idea.</i>

23:14.101 --> 23:16.103
Just when Halley
may have begun to wonder...

23:16.270 --> 23:19.149
...if Newton was bluffing,
as Hooke had done earlier...

23:19.315 --> 23:22.785
...a messenger arrived
with an envelope from Newton.

23:26.155 --> 23:29.830
Here are the opening pages
of modern science...

23:30.367 --> 23:32.620
...with its all-embracing
vision of nature...

23:33.203 --> 23:37.299
...universal laws of motion, gravity...

23:37.458 --> 23:42.259
...not just for the Earth
but for the cosmos.

23:42.421 --> 23:44.423
Halley raced back to Cambridge.

23:44.590 --> 23:47.594
Mr. Newton,
I beseech you to work all of this

23:47.760 --> 23:49.979
into a book as soon as possible.

23:50.137 --> 23:53.482
I can assure you
the Royal Society will publish it.

23:53.641 --> 23:55.359
<i><font color="#808080">TYSON :</font>
But there was one little problem.</i>

23:56.268 --> 24:01.024
We are in agreement that Mr. Newton
has produced a masterpiece.

24:01.190 --> 24:04.694
However, I'm afraid
the Royal Society has...

24:04.860 --> 24:08.831
Well, regrettably,
sales for the History of Fish...

24:08.989 --> 24:12.539
...have not lived up
to our financial expectations.

24:14.036 --> 24:15.379
<i><font color="#808080">TYSON :</font>
It's an impressive book.</i>

24:15.537 --> 24:19.542
Extremely comprehensive, really.

24:19.708 --> 24:25.010
It's filled with lavish illustrations
of, well, fish.

24:26.340 --> 24:29.219
The disappointing sales
led to a bigger problem.

24:29.385 --> 24:32.024
The Royal Society pretty
much blew its total

24:32.036 --> 24:34.687
<i>annual budget on the
History of Fish.</i>

24:34.848 --> 24:37.442
In fact, they were so strapped for cash...

24:37.601 --> 24:42.402
...they had to pay poor Halley's salary
with copies of their worst-selling book.

24:42.564 --> 24:45.408
<i>With no money to print
Newton's Principia...</i>

24:45.567 --> 24:49.322
...the scientific revolution
hung in the balance.

24:53.909 --> 24:55.752
Without Halley's heroic efforts...

24:55.911 --> 25:00.462
...the reclusive Newton's masterwork
might never have seen the light of day.

25:00.624 --> 25:02.422
But Halley was a man on a mission...

25:02.584 --> 25:06.054
...absolutely determined to bring
Newton's genius to the world.

25:06.797 --> 25:11.098
<i>That pre-scientific world,
the world ruled by fear...</i>

25:11.260 --> 25:14.434
<i>...was poised at the edge of a revolution.</i>

25:14.596 --> 25:17.440
<i>Everything depended
on whether or not Edmond Halley...</i>

25:17.599 --> 25:20.694
<i>...could get Newton's book
out to the wider world.</i>

25:20.853 --> 25:23.527
<i>Halley resolved not only
to edit Newton's book...</i>

25:23.689 --> 25:26.442
<i>...but to publish it at his own expense.</i>

25:26.608 --> 25:29.077
<i>Newton completed the first two volumes...</i>

25:29.236 --> 25:33.207
<i>...laying the mathematical framework
for the physics of motion.</i>

25:33.365 --> 25:37.836
<i>The third volume would settle once and
for all who won the coffeehouse wager.</i>

25:37.995 --> 25:42.171
<i>Newton applied his principles to explain
all the known motions of the Earth...</i>

25:42.332 --> 25:44.801
<i>...the moon and the planets.</i>

25:44.960 --> 25:47.964
Unfortunately, there was this problem.

25:48.130 --> 25:52.636
Now Halley also took on the role
of Newton's psychotherapist.

25:53.469 --> 25:55.471
Isaac, I'm afraid that Mr. Hooke...

25:55.637 --> 25:59.392
...requires an acknowledgment
in the preface of your third volume.

25:59.558 --> 26:02.937
But I have done so,
thanking him, Mr. Wren and yourself...

26:03.103 --> 26:05.982
...for prodding me to think again
on astronomical matters.

26:06.148 --> 26:08.526
Mr. Hooke has been going
about London...

26:08.692 --> 26:11.662
...saying that you got
the law of gravity from him.

26:11.820 --> 26:13.697
Why, that litigious little...

26:13.864 --> 26:18.495
Never. I would sooner burn the third volume
than deface it with such a lie.

26:18.660 --> 26:19.957
To hell with Hooke.

26:20.120 --> 26:23.670
He will be long forgotten when
your ideas are still being celebrated.

26:26.210 --> 26:29.589
More copies of that dreadful book?

26:29.755 --> 26:32.304
Wherever shall we put them all?

26:32.466 --> 26:34.139
We talked about this, Mary, dear.

26:34.301 --> 26:36.474
This is my salary from the Society.

26:36.637 --> 26:39.265
They have nothing else
with which to pay me.

26:39.431 --> 26:43.686
If only Mr. Hooke and Mr. Newton
were more like you.

26:43.852 --> 26:47.197
<i><font color="#808080">TYSON :</font> Halley and Wren decided
to confront Hooke about his false claims.</i>

26:47.856 --> 26:49.858
That law is mine, I tell you.

26:50.025 --> 26:51.277
I proved it first.

26:51.443 --> 26:53.366
Then fetch your
proof here at once.

26:53.529 --> 26:57.909
Let us see it. Surely we have
waited on it long enough.

26:58.325 --> 27:01.044
You'll simply have
to take my word for it.

27:01.203 --> 27:05.709
Empty claims may persuade elsewhere,
but not here.

27:05.874 --> 27:08.343
Put up or shut up, Mr. Hooke.

27:09.378 --> 27:11.847
Blasted Newton.
I'll make him pay.

27:28.647 --> 27:30.524
<i><font color="#808080">TYSON :</font>
If it wasn't for Edmond Halley...</i>

27:30.691 --> 27:35.697
...Newton's great book would've never
been conceived, nor written, nor printed.

27:35.863 --> 27:40.369
Okay, but so what?
What difference does that make to us?

27:40.534 --> 27:42.457
What's the big deal?

27:49.084 --> 27:54.932
When Isaac Newton was born in this house
in 1642, the world was very different.

27:55.090 --> 27:57.331
Everyone looked at the
perfection of the

27:57.343 --> 27:59.596
clockwork motions of the
planets in the sky...

27:59.761 --> 28:03.561
...and could only understand it
as the work of a master clockmaker.

28:03.724 --> 28:05.226
How else to explain it?

28:05.392 --> 28:09.272
There was only one way such a thing
could come about in their imagination.

28:09.438 --> 28:12.533
Only one answer for them: God.

28:12.691 --> 28:17.663
For reasons beyond our understanding,
God just created the solar system that way.

28:17.821 --> 28:20.950
But this explanation is
the closing of a door.

28:21.116 --> 28:23.960
It doesn't lead to other questions.

28:34.129 --> 28:39.135
Along came Newton, a God-loving man
who's also a genius.

28:39.301 --> 28:43.602
He could write the laws of nature
in perfect mathematical sentences.

28:43.764 --> 28:50.773
Formulas that applied universally
to apples, moons, planets and so much more.

28:53.523 --> 28:55.992
With one foot still in the Middle Ages...

28:56.151 --> 28:59.325
...Isaac Newton imagined
the whole solar system.

28:59.488 --> 29:02.588
Newton's laws of gravity
and motion revealed

29:02.600 --> 29:05.712
how the sun held distant
worlds captive.

29:05.869 --> 29:08.998
His laws swept away the need
for a master clockmaker...

29:09.164 --> 29:12.919
...to explain the precision
and beauty of the solar system.

29:13.085 --> 29:15.634
Gravity is the clockmaker.

29:16.421 --> 29:19.174
Matter obeyed commandments
we could discover...

29:19.341 --> 29:21.810
...laws the Bible hadn't mentioned.

29:21.969 --> 29:25.269
Newton's answer to why
the solar system is the way it is...

29:25.430 --> 29:28.183
...opened the way
to an infinite number of questions.

29:28.725 --> 29:32.355
Principia also happened to include
the invention of calculus...

29:32.521 --> 29:37.823
...and the first sound theoretical basis
for an end to our imprisonment on Earth:

29:37.985 --> 29:39.612
space travel.

29:43.365 --> 29:47.336
<i>Newton envisioned
the firing of a cannonball...</i>

29:47.494 --> 29:51.419

If Halley hadn't been standing
next to Newton for all those years...

...perhaps the world would remember him...

31:34.768 --> 31:37.487
...for his own host of

But the only thing that comes to mind
for most people is the comet.

31:42.025 --> 31:44.995
The irony is that discovering a comet...

...is actually one of the few things
that Halley never did.

Hmm. Our Dr. Halley's gone

33:07.027 --> 33:10.201
<i><font color="#808080">TYSON :</font>
He invented the weather map.</i>

33:11.698 --> 33:17.171
<i>And the symbols he devised for indicating
prevailing winds are still in use today.</i>

33:28.340 --> 33:32.265
Halley laid the groundwork
for the science of population statistics.

33:32.427 --> 33:33.428
How?

33:33.595 --> 33:39.352
He compared the birth, marriage, death and
population densities of London and Paris.

33:39.518 --> 33:42.863
He actually had to pace off
the entire perimeter of Paris on foot...

33:43.021 --> 33:44.898
...to learn its true dimensions.

33:45.065 --> 33:48.239
He came to the conclusion
that since roughly half of all adults...

33:48.401 --> 33:51.701
...fail to reproduce children,
who themselves survive to reproduce...

33:52.405 --> 33:55.255
...every married
couple must have four

33:55.267 --> 33:58.128
children in order to
maintain the population.

34:00.497 --> 34:04.377
And it was Edmond Halley who gave us
the actual scale of the solar system.

34:04.543 --> 34:08.172
He figured out a clever way
to find the distance from Earth to the sun.

34:08.338 --> 34:11.626
It involved precisely
measuring the time it took

34:11.638 --> 34:14.937
for the planet Venus to
cross the sun's disc.

34:17.304 --> 34:19.603
<i>Twenty-seven years after Halley's death...</i>

34:19.766 --> 34:22.690
<i>...Captain James Cook
made his first voyage to Tahiti...</i>

34:22.851 --> 34:25.650
<i>...for the express purpose of testing
Halley's method...</i>

34:25.813 --> 34:28.612
<i>...during a transit of
Venus across the sun.</i>

34:28.775 --> 34:30.994
<i>Using a special filter
to protect his vision...</i>

34:31.152 --> 34:33.780
<i>...from being destroyed
by looking directly at the sun...</i>

34:33.947 --> 34:36.416
<i>...Cook and his men made it possible
for us to know...</i>

34:36.574 --> 34:40.920
<i>...that the sun is 93
million miles from Earth.</i>

34:41.621 --> 34:44.471
And Halley was the first
to realize that the

34:44.483 --> 34:47.344
so-called fixed stars
were not fixed at all.

34:48.003 --> 34:49.175
How'd he do it?

34:49.337 --> 34:50.884
He pored over the observations...

34:51.047 --> 34:54.347
...made by the ancient Greek astronomers
of the brightest stars.

34:54.509 --> 34:56.261
And he compared
their observations...

34:56.428 --> 35:01.184
...with the ones he himself made
of the same stars 1800 years later.

35:01.349 --> 35:03.852
Why hadn't anyone
noticed this before?

35:04.019 --> 35:06.647
Halley figured out that it would
only become apparent...

35:06.813 --> 35:10.033
...if you waited long enough
between observations.

35:10.191 --> 35:13.445
It's hard to perceive the motions
of things that are far away.

35:13.612 --> 35:16.024
And the stars are so
very far away that you

35:16.036 --> 35:18.459
would need to track them
for many centuries...

35:18.617 --> 35:22.292
...before you could detect
that they moved at all.

35:23.913 --> 35:28.009
<i><font color="#808080">TYSON :</font> Halley discovered the first clue
to a magnificent reality:</i>

35:28.168 --> 35:31.593
<i>All the stars are in motion,
streaming past each other...</i>

35:31.755 --> 35:34.383
<i>...rising and falling
like merry-go-round horses...</i>

35:34.549 --> 35:39.350
<i>...in their Newtonian dance
around the center of our galaxy.</i>

35:40.347 --> 35:44.568
<i>And, oh, yes, there was that thing
about the comet.</i>

35:49.189 --> 35:51.908
What were those strange
and beautiful celestial visitors...

35:52.067 --> 35:54.741
...that appeared without warning
from time to time?

35:54.903 --> 35:58.077
Halley set out to solve this mystery
as a detective would...

35:58.239 --> 36:00.833
...by gathering
all credible eyewitness testimony.

36:00.992 --> 36:04.747
The earliest precise observations
of a comet that Halley could find...

36:04.913 --> 36:08.508
...were made in Constantinople
by Nicephorus Gregoras...

36:08.667 --> 36:12.888
...a Byzantine astronomer and monk,
in June 1337.

36:13.046 --> 36:16.846
Halley hunted down every
astronomical observation of a comet...

36:17.008 --> 36:22.686
...recorded in Europe
between 1472 and 1698.

36:22.847 --> 36:26.943
And remember, there was no such thing
as a search engine or a computer.

36:27.102 --> 36:30.606
All Halley had were his books and his mind.

36:30.772 --> 36:32.115
Now here comes the hard part:

36:32.273 --> 36:35.368
Halley had to take the observations
made for each comet...

36:35.527 --> 36:38.952
...and find the shape
of its actual path through space.

36:39.114 --> 36:41.208
No one else but Newton
had yet attempted...

36:41.366 --> 36:44.586
...to apply his new set of laws
to an astronomical question.

36:44.744 --> 36:48.089
In an arduous tour de force
of mathematical brilliance...

36:48.248 --> 36:54.802
...Halley discovered that comets were bound
to the sun in long elliptical orbits.

36:58.883 --> 37:03.059
And he was the first to know
that the comets seen in 1531

37:04.139 --> 37:08.986
...1607, and 1682...

37:09.144 --> 37:10.771
...were one and the same.

37:10.937 --> 37:14.157
A single comet that
returned every 76 years.

37:14.315 --> 37:17.819
In a stunning example
of true pattern recognition...

37:17.986 --> 37:22.116
...he predicted it would be seen again
more than 5O years in the future.

37:24.492 --> 37:27.587
<i>For millennia,
comets had been props for mystics...</i>

37:27.746 --> 37:31.876
<i>...who considered them to be
merely omens of human events.</i>

37:32.041 --> 37:36.387
Halley shattered their monopoly,
beating them at their own game.

37:36.546 --> 37:40.016
A game that no scientist
had ever played before:

37:40.175 --> 37:42.269
<i>prophecy .</i>

37:42.427 --> 37:44.179
And he did not hedge his bet.

37:44.345 --> 37:48.020
Like Babe Ruth predicting where his next
home run would land in the stands...

37:48.183 --> 37:53.280
...Halley stated flatly that the comet
would return at the end of 1758...

37:53.438 --> 37:58.490
...from a particular part of the sky,
following a specific path.

37:58.651 --> 38:01.154
There is hardly a prophecy
attempted by the mystics...

38:01.321 --> 38:05.417
...that ever even strives
for comparable precision.

38:26.054 --> 38:28.182
That's Halley's Comet.

38:28.348 --> 38:31.477
Out here at the edge of the solar system,
it doesn't look like much.

38:31.643 --> 38:34.863
Just a big hunk of ice and rock in space.

38:35.021 --> 38:39.618
That's because beyond the orbit of Neptune,
nearly 5 billion kilometers from the sun...

38:39.776 --> 38:41.870
...comets lead very quiet lives.

38:44.697 --> 38:46.825
As it reaches the far end of its orbit...

38:46.991 --> 38:50.586
...it'll slow down
till the sun allows it to go no farther.

38:50.745 --> 38:55.592
Then it'll begin its long fall
back to the inner solar system.

38:55.959 --> 38:59.088
Halley's Comet is in free fall
around the sun.

38:59.254 --> 39:00.801
Everything in our solar system...

39:00.964 --> 39:04.434
...the Earth, the moon,
the other planets, comets, asteroids...

39:04.592 --> 39:07.596
...all of them are falling around the sun.

39:07.762 --> 39:12.518
Gravity pulls the planets towards the sun,
but because of their orbital momentum...

39:12.684 --> 39:17.565
...they keep moving around the sun,
never falling into it.
