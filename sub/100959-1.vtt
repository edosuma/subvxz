WEBVTT

03:28.173 --> 03:30.940
Hey. How are you?

03:30.942 --> 03:32.475
Good, how are you?

03:32.477 --> 03:33.278
Good.

03:44.556 --> 03:45.291
Alex.

03:46.824 --> 03:48.093
It's so good to see you.

03:53.365 --> 03:54.429
How are you doing?

03:54.431 --> 03:56.198
I'm fine. Thanks.

03:56.200 --> 03:57.436
Alex!

03:58.270 --> 03:59.438
I thought that was you.

04:02.139 --> 04:04.907
How long has it been?
Six, seven months?

04:04.909 --> 04:06.108
Yeah, about that.

04:06.110 --> 04:08.877
Well you look
good, considering.

04:08.879 --> 04:09.879
Gwen.

04:09.881 --> 04:10.814
What?

04:10.816 --> 04:12.881
It's fine.

04:12.883 --> 04:14.316
Oh, there's Dawn!

04:14.318 --> 04:16.019
Dawn, Alex is here!

04:17.488 --> 04:18.790
Alex!

04:21.927 --> 04:23.827
It's so good to see you.

04:23.829 --> 04:24.864
You too.

04:26.831 --> 04:28.197
Have any of you seen Robin?

04:28.199 --> 04:29.502
Is she here?

04:30.267 --> 04:32.868
Yeah, she's up
in Jessica's room.

04:32.870 --> 04:34.173
Thanks.

04:36.107 --> 04:38.778
Well, she looks better
than I was expecting her to.

04:44.850 --> 04:46.315
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:46.317 --> 04:48.918
- She's in a better place, okay?
- Yeah.

04:48.920 --> 04:50.956
- If there's anything you need.
- Thanks.

05:35.966 --> 05:37.168
Robin?

05:50.482 --> 05:52.451
Remember
when we were kids?

05:54.286 --> 05:56.652
Jessica stole that bottle
of whiskey from my dad?

05:57.822 --> 06:00.925
We came up here and got piss-ass
drunk for the first time.

06:02.994 --> 06:04.594
Jessica threw
up in the hamper.

06:08.165 --> 06:10.502
Mom was so pissed the next
day when she did the laundry.

06:15.940 --> 06:17.976
When Mom and Dad died...

06:25.951 --> 06:27.987
Jessica took it pretty hard.

06:29.653 --> 06:31.189
I didn't stick
around to help her.

06:33.158 --> 06:34.627
That wasn't your fault, Robin.

06:38.028 --> 06:40.132
She always had you, though.

06:43.067 --> 06:45.137
I'm sorry you had to
find her like that.

07:01.119 --> 07:03.989
Now, to honour Jessica the
way she would want us to.

07:06.490 --> 07:10.058
Has anyone ever told you how
inappropriate you are, Gwen?

07:10.060 --> 07:14.029
People keep telling me,
and I keep ignoring them.

07:14.031 --> 07:16.132
I am good with
my wine, thank you.

07:16.134 --> 07:18.534
And can you guys
please use coasters?

07:18.536 --> 07:20.271
Don't leave any rings.

07:21.072 --> 07:22.305
Better?

07:22.307 --> 07:24.440
I'll do a shot, for Jessica.

07:24.442 --> 07:25.610
Yeah.

07:29.447 --> 07:31.083
Robin, Alex, shots.

07:35.519 --> 07:37.152
How long are you
guys staying for again?

07:37.154 --> 07:39.288
Well, we all took the
week off to be here for you.

07:39.290 --> 07:41.024
And is Brian gonna be
able to handle the kids

07:41.026 --> 07:42.692
for that long by himself?

07:42.694 --> 07:45.228
I don't know, I guess I'll
find out when I get home.

07:45.230 --> 07:48.331
So, did you and Brian
figure your shit out, then?

07:48.333 --> 07:52.368
It was a little touch-and-go,
but we worked things out.

07:52.370 --> 07:54.771
What exactly happened
between you two, anyways?

07:54.773 --> 07:57.406
Well, we went through a
rough patch financially.

07:57.408 --> 07:59.642
I thought it would be a good
idea to go back to work,

07:59.644 --> 08:01.676
but Brian didn't think so.

08:01.678 --> 08:04.147
With me working full-time,
he's had no choice

08:04.149 --> 08:08.618
but to do more around the house,
and take care of the kids.

08:08.620 --> 08:10.719
And let's just say he
wasn't happy about it.

08:10.721 --> 08:12.654
Typical guy.

08:12.656 --> 08:15.360
Yeah, the fighting
got so bad that,

08:16.560 --> 08:18.493
well, I had to take the
kids to my parents' house.

08:18.495 --> 08:21.599
Guess he realized that life
without me and the kids sucks.

08:23.701 --> 08:28.040
He promised to smarten up,
so I gave him a second chance.

08:29.206 --> 08:31.673
Well, at least your husband's
trying to work it out.

08:31.675 --> 08:33.508
Has Jason signed
the papers yet?

08:33.510 --> 08:35.645
No, he's being
an ass about it.

08:35.647 --> 08:39.214
He's going on about
how I was unfaithful,

08:39.216 --> 08:41.818
but I know he's been
slutting it up all over town.

08:41.820 --> 08:43.318
What a pig.

08:43.321 --> 08:45.387
I can kick his ass for
you, if you want me to.

08:45.389 --> 08:47.256
Okay, that I
would like to see.

08:47.258 --> 08:50.258
Hey, I've done it before.

08:50.260 --> 08:52.261
Remember Jessica's
old college boyfriend?

08:52.263 --> 08:54.597
The one he cheated
on with Sandra Reed.

08:54.599 --> 08:55.567
Kevin?

08:56.868 --> 08:57.767
Carl.

08:57.769 --> 09:00.636
That's it, Carl.

09:00.638 --> 09:03.138
What a sleaze ball.

09:03.140 --> 09:05.541
When Alex told me
what he did to her,

09:05.543 --> 09:08.578
I went straight to his dorm
room and kneed him in the nuts!

09:10.215 --> 09:12.882
Jess always had
terrible taste in men.

09:12.884 --> 09:14.286
Mm-hmm.

09:17.554 --> 09:19.690
To my sister, Jessica.

09:36.607 --> 09:41.379

09:42.813 --> 09:47.485

13:26.870 --> 13:28.503
Fuck, I think I
twisted my ankle.

13:28.505 --> 13:29.671
Can you stand?

13:29.673 --> 13:30.741
Okay.

13:31.875 --> 13:33.776
- Oh, oh, oh, oh!
- I got you. I got you.

13:33.778 --> 13:34.712
Oh my gosh.

13:35.712 --> 13:36.778
Oh, thanks...

13:36.780 --> 13:38.414
Samuel.

13:38.416 --> 13:39.949
- Sam, thanks Sam, I'm Dawn.
- It's a pleasure.

13:41.753 --> 13:42.884
Do you live
around here, Samuel?

13:42.886 --> 13:44.987
Yeah, I do.
You?

13:44.989 --> 13:46.921
No, I'm in town for a funeral,

13:46.923 --> 13:48.424
I'm crashing at
my friend's place.

13:48.426 --> 13:49.557
Well here, let
me get you inside.

13:49.559 --> 13:50.561
Thanks.

13:51.796 --> 13:53.628
Look at this one.

13:53.630 --> 13:56.998
Our first camping trip we took
together after high school.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.002
Thank God Robin showed up
to help us make a fire.

14:00.004 --> 14:02.405
Still trying to figure
out why you guys go camping

14:02.407 --> 14:03.841
without knowing how
to start a fire.

14:05.876 --> 14:07.843
You'd think after what
we went through as kids,

14:07.845 --> 14:09.044
you guys would know better.

14:09.046 --> 14:10.512
And I'm still
trying to figure out

14:10.514 --> 14:11.881
how you can drink
as much as you do

14:11.883 --> 14:13.782
and still manage to
get up this early.

14:13.784 --> 14:15.917
It's called practice.

14:15.919 --> 14:17.719
You want some coffee, Robin.

14:17.721 --> 14:18.490
Fuck yes.

14:22.025 --> 14:24.459
Hey Gwen, is this a picture
of your band's first gig?

14:24.461 --> 14:25.861
Look, there's your ex-boyfriend.

14:25.863 --> 14:27.762
Oh, yes.

14:27.764 --> 14:28.533
Damon.

14:29.966 --> 14:32.600
Man, I forgot how sexy he was.

14:32.602 --> 14:35.070
Him and his sick
tattoo of Rick Allen.

14:35.072 --> 14:36.508
The guy from Harry Potter?

14:37.808 --> 14:39.007
What?

14:39.009 --> 14:40.975
You're thinking of
the actor, Alan Rickman.

14:40.977 --> 14:43.746
No, guys, Rick Allen.

14:43.748 --> 14:45.150
The drummer from Def Leppard?

14:46.951 --> 14:49.185
Wow, you guys really need
to listen to better music.

14:49.187 --> 14:52.521
No, you just
haven't matured yet.

14:52.523 --> 14:55.791
You still act and dress
like a rebellious teenager.

14:55.793 --> 14:58.060
Well, you guys can
go fuck yourselves,

14:58.062 --> 15:00.228
because at least I
know how to have fun.

15:00.230 --> 15:01.564
Hey.

15:01.566 --> 15:02.964
I know how to have fun.

15:02.966 --> 15:04.903
If being in a drunken
haze is what you call fun.

15:08.572 --> 15:10.138
Oh my god, Dawn!

15:10.140 --> 15:12.074
What happened?

15:12.076 --> 15:14.045
I slipped and
twisted my ankle.

15:15.947 --> 15:19.547
I told you jogging in this
weather was such a bad idea.

15:19.549 --> 15:21.850
Just get me some ice, please?

15:21.852 --> 15:24.752
And who's the man candy?

15:24.754 --> 15:27.790
Oh, sorry guys, this is
Samuel, he's a neighbor.

15:27.792 --> 15:29.995
He saw me fall and
came to my rescue.

15:31.596 --> 15:34.095
And Samuel, these are my
friends, this is Maggie,

15:34.097 --> 15:38.166
this is Gwen, that
is Robin, and Alex.

15:38.168 --> 15:39.935
It's nice to meet you, Samuel.

15:39.937 --> 15:41.704
Please, make yourself at home.

15:41.706 --> 15:43.004
Thanks.

15:43.006 --> 15:44.973
It's nice to meet
you ladies as well.

15:44.975 --> 15:46.876
So you live
around here, Samuel?

15:46.878 --> 15:47.946
Yeah, I just moved here.

15:49.113 --> 15:50.115
Oh, thank you.

15:51.849 --> 15:53.916
It's nice to know there's
a strong, heroic man

15:53.918 --> 15:55.751
just around the corner.

15:55.753 --> 15:56.788
Heel, girl.

15:58.688 --> 16:00.289
So Samuel, what do you do?

16:00.291 --> 16:03.025
I'm a-
writer.

16:03.027 --> 16:04.826
Like poems and stuff?

16:04.828 --> 16:07.930
Yeah, I've written
some poetry before.

16:07.932 --> 16:10.598
But at the moment,
I'm working on a novel.

16:10.600 --> 16:12.600
Do you like Edgar Allen Poe?

16:12.602 --> 16:14.002
He's my favourite.

16:14.004 --> 16:15.970
You like the dark stuff, eh?

16:15.972 --> 16:18.040
It's one of my
favourite writing styles.

16:18.042 --> 16:20.041
So what are you
working on right now?

16:20.043 --> 16:23.311
Working on this novel, I'm
just working through the plot.

16:23.313 --> 16:27.718
Let's just say-
it's a tragic love story.

16:29.320 --> 16:31.954
I love a good love story.

16:31.956 --> 16:34.860
If you want, I could read
it, give you some notes.

16:36.092 --> 16:38.026
I read a lot of romantic novels.

16:38.028 --> 16:40.628
Maggie, your
lameness is showing.

16:40.630 --> 16:41.930
Screw you, Robin.

16:41.932 --> 16:43.799
At least I know how to read.

16:44.601 --> 16:45.870
Oh, burn.

16:47.871 --> 16:50.238
Well ladies, I would
love to stay and chat,

16:50.240 --> 16:52.206
but unfortunately there's
somewhere I need to be.

16:52.208 --> 16:54.209
What are you doing
for dinner tonight?

16:54.211 --> 16:56.878
Maggie's cooking us homemade
pasta, if you'd like to join.

16:56.880 --> 16:59.047
That sounds delicious.

16:59.049 --> 17:00.882
Shall we say 8:00?

17:00.884 --> 17:02.017
Sounds like a plan.

17:02.019 --> 17:03.852
See you ladies later tonight.

17:03.854 --> 17:05.690
- You gonna be okay?
- Yeah, thanks.

17:12.028 --> 17:14.833
Hey Gwen, you have a little
bit of drool right there.

17:28.613 --> 17:30.211
You okay, Alex?

17:30.213 --> 17:32.680
I'm fine, just
didn't sleep well.

17:32.682 --> 17:34.653
Must be weird sleeping
in Jessica's room.

17:36.086 --> 17:37.219
I'll be fine.

17:37.221 --> 17:39.388
I just need some
time to process.

17:39.390 --> 17:40.158
Yeah.

17:42.226 --> 17:43.728
Me too.

17:47.163 --> 17:48.863
Remember when you and Jessica
threw that house party

17:48.865 --> 17:50.632
when my parents
went out of town?

17:50.634 --> 17:52.703
Yeah, that was a crazy night.

17:53.738 --> 17:54.902
I walked in
here to see Jessica

17:54.904 --> 17:56.007
dancing on the table.

17:57.040 --> 17:59.208
Yeah, I remember that.

17:59.210 --> 18:00.976
That was the night
she tripped and fell

18:00.978 --> 18:03.045
and broke the living room TV.

18:03.047 --> 18:04.816
And I got blamed for it, too.

18:06.150 --> 18:08.816
Mom and Dad said since
I was her big sister,

18:08.818 --> 18:09.886
that I should be
looking out for her.

18:11.989 --> 18:14.890
Like every bad choice she's
made is somehow my fault.

18:14.892 --> 18:16.324
Do you guys think
Samuel would want

18:16.326 --> 18:17.325
white wine with dinner?

18:17.327 --> 18:19.228
We only have red left
from the other night.

18:19.230 --> 18:21.095
Fuck, I should've
run out to get more.

18:21.097 --> 18:22.366
Gwen, take a breath.

18:23.933 --> 18:25.100
There's enough wine.

18:25.102 --> 18:26.834
I'll be drinking
whiskey anyways.

18:26.836 --> 18:29.171
Oh good.
Show Samuel that

18:29.173 --> 18:31.305
you're basically a
guy right off the bat.

18:31.307 --> 18:33.275
That'll make
me look even better.

18:33.277 --> 18:36.045
'Cause you need all the
help you can get, right?

18:37.314 --> 18:38.313
Our special guest is here.

18:38.315 --> 18:39.618
I'll get it!

18:42.853 --> 18:44.318
Hey Samuel, come on in.

18:44.320 --> 18:45.888
Hi Gwen, I brought
this wine for the house.

18:45.890 --> 18:46.758
Oh, thank you.

18:47.924 --> 18:50.092
Oh, smells so good in here.

18:50.094 --> 18:51.162
Let me take your coat.

18:52.128 --> 18:53.194
Great, thank you.

18:53.196 --> 18:54.198
You're welcome.

18:55.365 --> 18:56.634
It's right over here.

18:57.468 --> 18:58.370
Oh, hey Samuel.

18:59.436 --> 19:01.303
So glad you could make it.

19:01.305 --> 19:02.438
How's your ankle?

19:02.440 --> 19:04.440
It's not too bad, it's a
bit swollen, but I'll survive.

19:04.442 --> 19:06.808
It just takes me a while to
get from point A to point B.

19:06.810 --> 19:08.142
Well let me help you.

19:08.144 --> 19:09.013
Oh, okay.

19:17.020 --> 19:17.920
This is so good.

19:17.922 --> 19:19.287
Thank you.

19:19.289 --> 19:22.123
It's actually my
husband's favourite meal.

19:22.125 --> 19:25.494
Hard to get my kids to eat
it, though, they're so picky.

19:25.496 --> 19:27.999
Well they are very lucky
to have a mom like you.

19:29.066 --> 19:30.899
And don't worry,
I'm sure they'll

19:30.901 --> 19:32.735
love your cooking
when they get older.

19:32.737 --> 19:34.103
Do any of you ladies have kids?

19:34.105 --> 19:35.136
Oh, hell no.

19:35.138 --> 19:37.271
I ain't ready for that shit yet.

19:37.273 --> 19:40.875
Gwen is just scared of the
idea of becoming an adult.

19:40.877 --> 19:42.510
I am not.

19:42.512 --> 19:45.380
No responsibilities gives me
all the freedom that I need.

19:45.382 --> 19:46.914
Aha, free spirit.

19:46.916 --> 19:48.182
Exactly.

19:48.184 --> 19:50.052
Take Dawn, for example.

19:50.054 --> 19:51.819
She chose a career so demanding

19:51.821 --> 19:53.921
that we never see her anymore.

19:53.923 --> 19:55.190
And what is it that you do?

19:55.192 --> 19:56.959
I'm a registered nurse.

19:56.961 --> 19:58.494
Seems a cruel
irony for the one

19:58.496 --> 19:59.862
that's a nurse to get injured.

19:59.864 --> 20:01.095
Right?

20:01.097 --> 20:02.430
This is how the
universe thanks me?

20:02.432 --> 20:03.998
Awesome.

20:04.000 --> 20:07.169
So Dawn mentioned
earlier that you ladies

20:07.171 --> 20:09.171
are here for a funeral.

20:09.173 --> 20:13.007
I'm sure it's a touchy
subject, but I'm just curious.

20:13.009 --> 20:13.944
What happened?

20:19.083 --> 20:22.284
Our friend
Jessica passed away.

20:22.286 --> 20:24.186
She was Robin's
younger sister.

20:24.188 --> 20:25.724
I'm so sorry.

20:26.957 --> 20:28.493
What happened, if you
don't mind me asking?

20:34.397 --> 20:37.431
She had an accident,
with some razor blades

20:37.433 --> 20:38.435
in the bathtub.

20:39.903 --> 20:41.105
Robin!

20:42.071 --> 20:43.407
I think I'm gonna go to bed.

20:44.441 --> 20:45.777
Thanks for dinner, Maggie.

20:55.051 --> 20:56.317
I'm sorry I brought it up.

20:56.319 --> 20:57.387
That's okay.

20:58.888 --> 21:01.892
It's just that Alex was
the one that found her.

21:03.426 --> 21:06.865
And she's having a
really hard time with it.

21:09.933 --> 21:14.538
So maybe we should just be
more sensitive about it.

21:18.474 --> 21:21.109
I mean, it's
totally understandable.

21:21.111 --> 21:23.314
If I saw something like that,
it would really mess me up.

21:24.848 --> 21:26.150
She'll find her
own way to cope.

21:46.871 --> 21:48.237
Robin's in the Army.

21:48.239 --> 21:49.271
She was.

21:49.273 --> 21:52.607
She was discharged for
alcohol and drug abuse.

21:52.609 --> 21:54.276
Jessica's standing
next to her?

21:54.278 --> 21:55.611
Yeah, that's her.

21:55.613 --> 21:56.978
Sorry I brought
that up earlier.

21:56.980 --> 21:58.279
Don't worry about it.

21:58.281 --> 22:01.085
Robin can be a bit
insensitive when she drinks.

22:02.886 --> 22:05.487
Robin's always turned to
alcohol when she's hurting.

22:05.489 --> 22:07.588
Doesn't really deal
with pain all that well.

22:07.590 --> 22:08.990
Well, we all have our own way

22:08.992 --> 22:10.926
of coping with
painful situations.

22:10.928 --> 22:12.661
Yeah, it just gets
me thinking, you know?

22:12.663 --> 22:15.998
About how to deal
with my own problems.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.099
What kind of problems?

22:17.101 --> 22:18.499
Mostly my divorce.

22:18.501 --> 22:19.934
What happened?

22:19.936 --> 22:21.004
Can you keep a secret?

22:27.111 --> 22:28.513
Of course.

22:29.445 --> 22:31.580
With spending all that
time at the hospital,

22:31.582 --> 22:33.614
Jason and I barely
saw each other,

22:33.616 --> 22:36.651
and let's just say
during med school,

22:36.653 --> 22:38.923
I realized how attracted
I am to doctors.

22:41.925 --> 22:43.225
And your husband?

22:43.227 --> 22:45.928
Well, when he
found out, I thought

22:45.930 --> 22:48.162
he was going to be heartbroken.

22:48.164 --> 22:50.097
But he didn't really care.

22:50.099 --> 22:52.167
He'd been sleeping with
others on the side,

22:52.169 --> 22:55.003
and I don't even know
who cheated first.

22:55.005 --> 22:56.705
I kinda know what
you're going through.

22:56.707 --> 22:58.172
You do?

22:58.174 --> 23:00.409
The last girlfriend
I had cheated on me.

23:00.411 --> 23:02.143
What did you do?

23:02.145 --> 23:04.645
Well, I went out and
slept with someone else.

23:04.647 --> 23:06.448
Really?

23:06.450 --> 23:09.584
Yeah, it was like,
payback or something.

23:09.586 --> 23:11.286
Exactly.

23:11.288 --> 23:12.056
Yeah.

23:13.589 --> 23:16.057
Well, I should
probably get going.

23:16.059 --> 23:19.327
Before you go, could
you help me up to my room?

23:19.329 --> 23:21.697
With my ankle, the
stairs are kinda hard.

23:21.699 --> 23:23.268
Oh, of course.

23:26.202 --> 23:27.736
Are you okay?

23:27.738 --> 23:29.470
Yeah, I'm fine.

23:29.472 --> 23:30.207
Hmm.

23:34.178 --> 23:36.178
Are you gonna help
us clean up, Robin,

23:36.180 --> 23:37.478
or just stand there drinking?

23:37.480 --> 23:39.448
What's your problem, Maggie?

23:39.450 --> 23:42.249
You are my problem, Robin.

23:42.251 --> 23:44.987
How could you be so
insensitive at dinner tonight?

23:44.989 --> 23:46.755
He didn't mean any harm.

23:46.757 --> 23:49.391
I just told him the truth.

23:49.393 --> 23:51.459
Quit being so
sensitive about it.

23:51.461 --> 23:53.094
You were being
pretty harsh, Robin.

23:53.096 --> 23:56.198
Can't you see how much you
bothered Alex at dinner?

23:56.200 --> 23:58.970
Don't lecture me on what's
right or wrong to say, Gwen.

24:00.003 --> 24:02.437
You can be more ignorant
than me sometimes.

24:02.439 --> 24:04.008
That's so not true.

24:05.776 --> 24:08.543
Fuck both of you guys,
I am not ignorant.

24:18.188 --> 24:19.357
I had your back, Maggie.

24:21.057 --> 24:23.091
It would've been nice
to know you had mine.

24:23.093 --> 24:24.793
I'm sorry, Gwen.

24:24.795 --> 24:28.263
You are not as much of
an ass as Robin can be.

24:28.265 --> 24:29.163
Thank you.

24:29.165 --> 24:30.567
Now was that so hard?

24:33.369 --> 24:36.071
So Samuel seems
pretty cool, hey?

24:36.073 --> 24:37.773
He's really nice.

24:37.775 --> 24:40.342
Totally not your type, though.

24:40.344 --> 24:42.209
Hey, I'm not picky.

24:42.211 --> 24:44.379
I like all kinds of guys.

24:44.381 --> 24:46.381
Yes, I tend to go
for the bad boys,

24:46.383 --> 24:48.385
but I like the sexy
creative types too.

24:51.355 --> 24:54.558
I just hope Alex is okay.

24:56.292 --> 24:58.059
You know, just the
mention of Jessica's name

24:58.061 --> 24:59.296
makes her so uncomfortable.

25:01.765 --> 25:03.532
Do you think she
knows the reason

25:03.534 --> 25:05.036
why Jessica killed herself?

25:06.470 --> 25:08.236
I don't know, maybe.

25:08.238 --> 25:10.538
I mean, they were
closer than any of us.

25:10.540 --> 25:12.509
Should we just ask
her what she knows?

25:14.111 --> 25:15.677
Poor girl's already
been through so much.

25:15.679 --> 25:17.379
She doesn't need
us pestering her.

25:17.381 --> 25:18.779
But what if the reason
she killed herself

25:18.781 --> 25:20.585
had to do with the incident?

25:25.221 --> 25:26.490
That was so long ago.

25:28.791 --> 25:30.394
We were just kids.

25:33.297 --> 25:35.796
Besides, we agreed
not to talk about it.

25:35.798 --> 25:37.667
We put it behind
us and moved on.

25:40.136 --> 25:41.571
What if Jessica didn't?

26:45.669 --> 26:47.772
Almost there, almost there.

26:48.905 --> 26:49.804
Thanks.

26:49.806 --> 26:51.174
Oh, my pleasure.

26:51.842 --> 26:53.507
Oh, what the hell.

27:37.487 --> 27:39.220
All right, Dawn.

27:42.925 --> 27:46.594
Dear Heavenly Father,
please help us all

27:46.596 --> 27:48.697
get through
this troubled time.

27:48.699 --> 27:51.999
I fear that Robin is slipping
down another dark path,

27:52.001 --> 27:55.205
and needs your guidance
now, more than ever.

27:56.906 --> 27:58.509
And comfort Alex.

27:59.776 --> 28:00.878
Help her stay strong.

28:02.278 --> 28:03.814
Help us all stay strong.

28:05.348 --> 28:06.981
Amen.

28:06.983 --> 28:14.925
♪ Amazing grace,
how sweet the sound ♪

28:16.526 --> 28:22.533
♪ That saved a wretch like me ♪

28:25.635 --> 28:30.671
♪ I once was lost ♪

28:30.673 --> 28:35.009

28:35.011 --> 28:41.384
♪ Was blind but now I see ♪

28:43.053 --> 28:44.552
Pass that joint.

28:47.290 --> 28:48.856
Okay, you know what would
be good right about now?

28:48.858 --> 28:49.790
What?

28:49.792 --> 28:50.624
Food.

28:50.626 --> 28:51.492
Chips.

28:51.494 --> 28:52.594
Ice cream.

28:52.596 --> 28:53.761
Cake.
No, I want chips.

28:53.763 --> 28:55.029
We had cake the other day.

28:55.031 --> 28:57.065
Oh, hey, I think I saw
some earlier, actually.

28:57.067 --> 28:59.933
- Hold up, hold up.
- It's dark.

28:59.935 --> 29:02.569
Guys, guys, guys, I think
I hear someone coming.

29:02.571 --> 29:05.940
You're being paranoid.

29:05.942 --> 29:07.741
Busted.

29:07.743 --> 29:09.446
Check out what I snuck in.

29:10.513 --> 29:12.314
What the hell's that stuff?

29:12.316 --> 29:14.548
Shut up and take a swig.

29:14.550 --> 29:15.485
Share that joint.

29:17.554 --> 29:19.353
Come on Jess, just drink it.

29:19.355 --> 29:20.421
Shut up, Robin.

29:20.423 --> 29:21.890
Drink it, drink it!

29:21.892 --> 29:22.824
Drink it!

29:22.826 --> 29:23.792
Drink it!

29:23.794 --> 29:24.625
Drink it!

29:24.627 --> 29:25.459
Drink it!

29:25.461 --> 29:26.393
Drink it!

29:30.599 --> 29:31.901
Oh my god, that's nasty shit!

29:34.371 --> 29:36.007
But it makes
church less boring.

30:33.930 --> 30:35.662
I'll be home in
just a few days.

30:35.664 --> 30:36.831
Love you, Mommy.

30:36.833 --> 30:39.433
Love you guys.
I miss you so much.

30:39.435 --> 30:41.503
- Bye Mommy.
- I love you, Mommy.

30:41.505 --> 30:42.437
Bye.

30:46.509 --> 30:47.577
What the fuck, Robin?

30:48.811 --> 30:49.777
You can't sit over there?

30:49.779 --> 30:50.944
Nope.

30:50.946 --> 30:51.848
I like the couch.

30:52.949 --> 30:53.918
Whatever.

30:57.086 --> 30:58.021
There she is.

30:59.823 --> 31:00.891
And how was your night?

31:02.491 --> 31:03.792
Why are you looking
at me like that?

31:03.794 --> 31:04.895
Don't play dumb.

31:05.796 --> 31:07.398
Is he still here?

31:08.498 --> 31:10.198
What are you talking about?

31:10.200 --> 31:12.836
Dawn and Samuel
had sex last night.

31:13.903 --> 31:14.739
What?

31:16.138 --> 31:18.006
You guys had sex?

31:18.008 --> 31:20.808
Guess you missed
your chance, Gwen.

31:20.810 --> 31:22.544
So how was he?

31:22.546 --> 31:24.645
I don't really wanna
talk about it right now.

31:24.647 --> 31:25.947
That bad, huh?

31:25.949 --> 31:27.715
No, he was awesome.

31:27.717 --> 31:30.785
Though I did wake up by
myself this morning, but-

31:30.787 --> 31:33.854
She he banged ya
and ditched ya.

31:33.856 --> 31:34.988
That's gotta be rough.

31:34.990 --> 31:37.057
Shut up, Gwen.

31:37.059 --> 31:39.594
He probably just
had somewhere to be.

31:39.596 --> 31:40.929
Don't be jealous.

31:40.931 --> 31:42.432
I'm not jealous.

31:46.102 --> 31:48.969
Maybe it's Samuel,
coming to apologize

31:48.971 --> 31:50.907
for walking out on
you this morning.

31:56.212 --> 31:57.345
Can I help you?

31:57.347 --> 32:01.615
Good morning.
I'm Detective Miles Lancaster.

32:01.617 --> 32:03.183
Is Robin Hayward here?

32:03.185 --> 32:05.152
Yeah.
She's in the living room.

32:05.154 --> 32:07.221
May I speak with her?

32:07.223 --> 32:08.893
Of course.
Please, come on in.

32:16.500 --> 32:18.199
I'm Detective Miles Lancaster.

32:18.201 --> 32:22.135
May I speak with you
in private, please?

32:22.137 --> 32:23.039
Sure.

32:27.978 --> 32:31.179
Well, I've been looking
closer into your sister's death,

32:31.181 --> 32:32.846
and I've come across some things

32:32.848 --> 32:35.016
that just don't quite add up.

32:35.018 --> 32:36.817
Like what?

32:36.819 --> 32:40.087
Well, we found high levels
of Adavan in Jessica's system.

32:40.089 --> 32:41.788
Yeah.

32:41.790 --> 32:44.859
She was taking it to help
her with her anxiety.

32:44.861 --> 32:46.995
Well, on the night she
died, we found a dose

32:46.997 --> 32:50.832
that was five times
her recommended amount.

32:50.834 --> 32:51.735
So what?

32:53.068 --> 32:55.670
Maybe she tried to kill
herself with the pills,

32:55.672 --> 32:58.142
and when that didn't work,
she decided to slit her wrists.

33:00.009 --> 33:01.676
With the amount she took,
it would've put her

33:01.678 --> 33:03.678
in an almost comatose state.

33:03.680 --> 33:05.179
I don't believe she
would've been capable

33:05.181 --> 33:06.549
of cutting her own wrists.

33:07.884 --> 33:10.120
Are you saying someone
else cut her wrists?

33:11.121 --> 33:12.921
It's a possibility.

33:12.923 --> 33:14.588
Do you know anyone
who'd want to...

33:14.590 --> 33:15.525
No.

33:16.527 --> 33:18.229
I don't know anyone that
would want Jess dead.

33:19.663 --> 33:20.264
Everyone loved her.

33:36.846 --> 33:37.948
Robin, what's going on?

33:39.115 --> 33:40.017
Robin, slow down.

33:40.884 --> 33:43.617
What's the matter?

33:43.619 --> 33:44.787
It's Jessica.

33:47.289 --> 33:48.893
They think she's been murdered.

33:51.327 --> 33:52.096
Jess.

33:55.898 --> 33:57.699
Murder?

33:57.701 --> 34:00.969
Nothing is for sure yet.

34:00.971 --> 34:03.740
I'm just wanting to
explore every possibility.

34:05.608 --> 34:08.675
Do you ladies have
any information

34:08.677 --> 34:11.012
that might help us
in our investigation?

34:11.014 --> 34:12.746
Like what?

34:12.748 --> 34:16.851
Any of you know anyone
who'd want to hurt Jessica.

34:16.853 --> 34:18.322
Did she have any enemies?

34:19.655 --> 34:21.889
No one comes to mind.

34:21.891 --> 34:25.659
How long did you
ladies know Jessica?

34:25.661 --> 34:26.927
We grew up together.

34:26.929 --> 34:29.396
Same school, same church.

34:29.398 --> 34:31.364
Thank you, Ms.-?

34:31.367 --> 34:33.266
Alex Palmer.

34:33.268 --> 34:35.003
Palmer?

34:35.005 --> 34:37.306
Your father wouldn't
happen to be George Palmer?

34:38.340 --> 34:39.340
He is.

34:39.342 --> 34:41.010
I attend your father's church.

34:42.878 --> 34:44.213
He's a good man.

34:46.016 --> 34:49.150
I don't think I've ever seen
you at the church before.

34:49.152 --> 34:50.751
I don't go anymore.

34:50.753 --> 34:51.322
I see.

34:53.188 --> 34:55.759
I was there when your father's
old church burned down.

34:58.360 --> 34:59.663
What a terrible night.

35:04.300 --> 35:05.068
Well.

35:06.835 --> 35:11.375
If you ladies think of
anything, please give me a call.

35:14.811 --> 35:16.246
And give your father my best.

35:17.681 --> 35:18.849
Thank you, Detective.

35:29.925 --> 35:30.827
Oh my god.

35:34.097 --> 35:37.331
I can't believe that he
was there at the church.

35:37.333 --> 35:39.367
Relax, Maggie.

35:39.369 --> 35:41.869
Everyone thinks the fire started

35:41.871 --> 35:44.938
because of the lightning
storm, so that's what happened.

35:44.940 --> 35:46.273
Yeah.

35:46.275 --> 35:49.242
Besides, he's looking
into Jessica's death,

35:49.244 --> 35:51.414
not what happened at
the church 16 years ago.

35:53.382 --> 35:54.150
Yeah.

35:55.719 --> 35:57.150
You're right.

35:57.152 --> 35:58.786
Do you guys
really think Jessica

35:58.788 --> 36:00.954
could've been murdered, though?

36:00.956 --> 36:03.057
I mean, who would
want to kill Jessica?

36:03.059 --> 36:05.929
She was like, the
nicest person ever.

36:06.996 --> 36:08.862
Was she, though?

36:08.864 --> 36:10.133
What do you mean?

36:13.936 --> 36:15.038
Well,

36:17.273 --> 36:20.074
not only was she constantly

36:20.076 --> 36:22.045
screwing over Robin when
they were growing up,

36:23.847 --> 36:26.780
but she was getting really
close with my husband

36:26.782 --> 36:28.416
these last couple months.

36:28.418 --> 36:30.751
You think Jessica was
interested in Jason?

36:30.753 --> 36:32.854
I couldn't see her doing
something like that, though.

36:34.157 --> 36:37.525
Guys, the detective's
just being paranoid.

36:37.527 --> 36:39.392
Jess couldn't deal with what
happened when we were kids,

36:39.394 --> 36:41.963
it fucked her up so much,
and when her parents died,

36:41.965 --> 36:43.233
it just pushed
her over the edge.

36:44.534 --> 36:46.767
She opened up to me
about it a couple times.

36:46.769 --> 36:49.036
She wasn't handling
it very well.

36:49.038 --> 36:50.106
You're probably right.

36:51.875 --> 36:53.474
Just wonder how Robin's
taking all of this.

36:53.476 --> 36:55.112
She stormed out of
here pretty upset.

37:01.451 --> 37:02.885
Well, I'm gonna go look for her.

37:07.257 --> 37:09.927
All this time I've
been blaming myself.

37:11.260 --> 37:13.029
If I would've just took
the time to see her,

37:15.097 --> 37:17.831
to listen to what she
was going through,

37:17.833 --> 37:19.302
maybe she'd still be here.

37:22.070 --> 37:23.973
You can't live your
life wondering what if.

37:26.275 --> 37:30.411
But what if the detective
is on to something?

37:30.413 --> 37:33.113
Things are getting
pretty tense in there.

37:33.115 --> 37:34.916
How's it going out here?

37:34.918 --> 37:35.885
Better, I guess.

37:36.985 --> 37:38.387
Samuel managed to calm me down.

37:39.556 --> 37:41.956
Samuel to the rescue again.

37:41.958 --> 37:43.891
I'm just doing
what anyone would.

37:43.893 --> 37:45.195
I appreciate it.

37:46.028 --> 37:48.429
Hey Robin, did
you know Jessica

37:48.431 --> 37:50.898
was really close
with Dawn's husband?

37:50.900 --> 37:52.200
She was?

37:52.202 --> 37:54.302
Yeah, Dawn just told us.

37:54.304 --> 37:56.269
Yeah, Dawn mentioned
it to me the other night

37:56.271 --> 37:58.238
that her husband
was cheating on her.

37:58.240 --> 38:00.244
Maybe Jessica was one
of Jason's mistresses?

38:17.360 --> 38:18.959
Hey, Robin.

38:18.961 --> 38:22.162
You okay?

38:22.164 --> 38:23.898
Did you kill Jessica?

38:23.900 --> 38:24.968
What?

38:29.137 --> 38:31.037
You heard me.

38:31.039 --> 38:32.472
Did you murder my
sister because she's

38:32.474 --> 38:34.175
sleeping with your husband?

38:34.177 --> 38:36.911
Are you seriously
asking me this?

38:36.913 --> 38:38.345
Just answer the question.

38:38.347 --> 38:40.951
I think you've had a bit
too much to drink, again.

38:45.288 --> 38:48.155
Just answer the
fucking question.

38:48.157 --> 38:49.590
Of course not.

38:49.592 --> 38:51.295
And fuck you for
even asking me that.

39:06.175 --> 39:07.974
Samuel, what are
you doing here?

39:07.976 --> 39:09.276
Well, I was worried about you.

39:09.278 --> 39:10.480
I wanted to see
how you were doing.

39:12.148 --> 39:14.382
You know what I need.

39:14.384 --> 39:15.316
What?

39:15.318 --> 39:15.986
A distraction.

39:51.688 --> 39:53.354
God, I hate church.

39:53.356 --> 39:55.155
So depressing.

39:55.157 --> 39:56.523
At least your
family only makes you

39:56.525 --> 39:58.358
come here on special occasions.

39:58.360 --> 40:01.729
My dad's the reverend. I have
to come here every Sunday,

40:01.731 --> 40:03.965
whether I want to or not.

40:03.967 --> 40:05.465
Yeah, that sucks.

40:05.467 --> 40:08.469
My parents were pissed when
I quit coming every Sunday.

40:08.471 --> 40:11.204
At least they still have
their golden child, though.

40:11.206 --> 40:12.539
Don't call me that.

40:12.541 --> 40:14.108
I hate church just
as much as you do.

40:14.110 --> 40:17.177
In fact, I probably hate
it even more than you do.

40:17.179 --> 40:19.447
All right, little
badass, prove it.

40:19.449 --> 40:21.983
Do something to prove
how rebellious you are

40:21.985 --> 40:23.416
against this place.

40:23.418 --> 40:24.186
Fine.

40:25.188 --> 40:25.956
I will.

40:35.431 --> 40:37.134
Prove it, then, mmm.

40:40.570 --> 40:43.039
Nice try, but that's
not good enough.

40:47.577 --> 40:49.112
Hey, that's my whiskey
you're wasting there.

40:56.585 --> 40:58.221
What are you doing?

41:03.525 --> 41:05.626
Holy shit, Jessica.

41:05.628 --> 41:06.430
You're crazy.

41:07.797 --> 41:09.362
I'm impressed, sis.

41:09.364 --> 41:11.033
Now give me back my whiskey.

41:14.170 --> 41:14.671
Crazy.

41:15.771 --> 41:16.974
You're insane.

42:38.887 --> 42:41.889
Thank you so much
for seeing me, Dr. Zimmerman.

42:41.891 --> 42:44.425
It's not a
problem, Detective Lancaster.

42:44.427 --> 42:46.726
I just hope I can be
of some assistance.

42:46.728 --> 42:49.829
Now, you had some questions
about Jessica Hayward?

42:49.831 --> 42:51.264
Yes.

42:51.266 --> 42:53.601
How long was Jessica
your patient?

42:53.603 --> 42:54.834
About 15 years.

42:54.836 --> 42:57.137
- Long time.
- Yes.

42:57.139 --> 42:58.208
I thought we were
making progress.

42:59.775 --> 43:01.208
Suicide.

43:01.210 --> 43:02.675
We have reason to
believe her death

43:02.677 --> 43:04.681
may not have been a suicide.

43:14.657 --> 43:16.226
Fuck's sakes.

43:18.661 --> 43:20.693
A little help would be nice.

43:20.695 --> 43:22.463
Hello?

43:22.465 --> 43:23.300
Everything all right?

43:24.534 --> 43:25.833
Oh.

43:25.835 --> 43:27.800
Yeah, everything's fine.

43:27.802 --> 43:29.105
Just a little spill.

43:30.438 --> 43:31.440
Let me help you.

43:35.644 --> 43:36.413
Thanks.

43:37.847 --> 43:39.445
What did you bring?

43:39.447 --> 43:43.383
I brought you my homemade
vegetarian casserole.

43:43.385 --> 43:45.318
How did you know
I was vegetarian?

43:45.320 --> 43:46.954
Dawn must've said something.

43:46.956 --> 43:48.291
Oh.

43:48.858 --> 43:51.260
Well, that is so sweet of you.

43:53.461 --> 43:56.500
What is with you always
coming to the rescue?

43:58.201 --> 43:59.336
Just my thing, I guess.

44:00.902 --> 44:04.338
Well you are so much more
considerate than my husband.

44:04.340 --> 44:06.307
I get about the same
amount of respect from him

44:06.309 --> 44:07.874
as I do from my friends.

44:07.876 --> 44:09.943
You know, I'm just trying
to be here to support

44:09.945 --> 44:13.746
Alex and Robin, and they're
not making it very easy.

44:13.748 --> 44:15.151
Well maybe I can help.

44:15.952 --> 44:16.586
How?

44:19.521 --> 44:20.724
I have my ways.

44:31.434 --> 44:34.834
I was hoping you could
share her files with us.

44:34.836 --> 44:36.704
There's a good
chance they contain

44:36.706 --> 44:39.940
important information that
could lead us to the truth

44:39.942 --> 44:41.976
about what happened to Jessica.

44:41.978 --> 44:43.213
I see.

44:44.347 --> 44:47.880
Unfortunately, doctor-patient
confidentiality prevents

44:47.882 --> 44:50.319
me from sharing
that kind of information.

44:51.686 --> 44:53.389
I'll get a warrant, then.

44:55.458 --> 44:58.525
Do you mind if I ask you one
more question before I go?

44:58.527 --> 45:00.260
Of course.

45:00.262 --> 45:02.630
How long had you been
prescribing Jessica Adavan?

45:02.632 --> 45:05.331
Oh, I've been
prescribing it to her

45:05.333 --> 45:06.666
since her parents
brought her to me.

45:06.668 --> 45:09.702
She suffered from serious
depression as a teenager.

45:09.704 --> 45:12.472
What caused her depression?

45:12.474 --> 45:15.309
We rooted it back to a
church fire she witnessed

45:15.311 --> 45:16.546
where several people died.

45:17.913 --> 45:20.481
I believe she suffered
from survivor's guilt.

45:20.483 --> 45:23.349
Survivor's guilt?

45:23.351 --> 45:25.418
You know, when
others died, but you

45:25.420 --> 45:27.420
were the one who was spared.

45:27.422 --> 45:30.391
Did she lose someone that day?

45:30.393 --> 45:31.394
No one close to her.

45:32.762 --> 45:34.431
Her family and friends
made it out safely.

45:35.965 --> 45:38.932
I think the thing
that got to her

45:38.934 --> 45:40.967
was the death of a
seven-year-old boy

45:40.969 --> 45:42.705
who never made it
out of the fire.

45:44.039 --> 45:48.878
I believe his name was
Lucas King, or Kingly.

45:49.811 --> 45:50.911
Kingsley.

45:50.913 --> 45:51.748
Yes.

45:52.847 --> 45:54.416
And he was only five.

45:55.451 --> 45:57.050
Did you know the boy?

45:57.052 --> 45:59.688
Lucas-

46:01.824 --> 46:03.324
was my son.

46:04.025 --> 46:05.793
Oh.

46:05.795 --> 46:09.532
He kept his mother's
name after he was born.

46:11.766 --> 46:12.768
We never married.

46:13.869 --> 46:15.836
I'm so sorry for your loss.

46:16.806 --> 46:19.440
It was almost 20 years ago.

46:19.442 --> 46:20.010
Still.

46:21.010 --> 46:22.679
Those tragedies stay with us.

46:23.913 --> 46:24.780
Yes.

46:26.849 --> 46:27.717
They do.

46:41.429 --> 46:43.429
I heard the music and I
had to come check it out.

46:43.431 --> 46:44.932
Thank you.

46:44.934 --> 46:46.566
What are you doing here?

46:46.568 --> 46:48.969
I brought over an
apple pie for Maggie,

46:48.971 --> 46:50.903
which I baked this morning.

46:50.905 --> 46:52.373
That was nice of you.

46:52.375 --> 46:53.740
I didn't know you baked.

46:53.742 --> 46:55.311
Every now and then.

46:56.711 --> 46:58.979
I guess I'll have to find
out if you're any good at it.

47:01.983 --> 47:03.987
I'm not the only one
with a hidden talent.

47:06.521 --> 47:08.324
That song you were playing,
did you write that?

47:09.992 --> 47:12.525
You're really good.
Do you play in a band?

47:12.527 --> 47:13.996
Yeah.
Well, I used to.

47:17.400 --> 47:18.367
Used to.

47:25.875 --> 47:27.641
What happened?

47:27.643 --> 47:28.911
Oh, I don't know.

47:34.016 --> 47:35.816
It feels good to get
things off your chest

47:35.818 --> 47:36.953
when things are bothering you.

47:39.054 --> 47:41.954
I've kinda been dealing with
a serious gambling addiction.

47:41.956 --> 47:43.624
Really?

47:43.626 --> 47:45.025
Yeah.

47:45.027 --> 47:47.494
Got really outta control
there for a while.

47:50.032 --> 47:52.836
You got one week to
bring me the money you owe us.

47:55.003 --> 47:56.839
One week.

48:03.746 --> 48:05.115
I hurt a lot of people.

48:07.983 --> 48:10.720
My band got tired of dealing
with me, so they kicked me out.

48:12.554 --> 48:13.123
I'm sorry.

48:14.824 --> 48:16.190
I'm just scared people
are gonna judge me

48:16.192 --> 48:17.894
when I tell them this
kinda shit, you know?

48:19.862 --> 48:20.930
Don't worry, Gwen.

48:23.032 --> 48:24.467
Your secret's safe with me.

48:27.570 --> 48:28.104
Oh hey, Samuel.

48:29.237 --> 48:30.704
What are you doing here?

48:30.706 --> 48:32.706
Just thought I'd
pop in and say hi.

48:32.708 --> 48:35.809
Can I talk to you
for a minute, alone?

48:35.811 --> 48:36.679
Of course.

48:46.255 --> 48:47.954
Oh my god.

48:47.956 --> 48:49.856
Isn't he such a sweetheart?

48:49.858 --> 48:51.126
I know.

48:51.793 --> 48:52.961
I don't know about that.

48:55.063 --> 48:57.563
You didn't say anything
to anybody, did you?

48:57.565 --> 48:58.134
About us?

48:59.134 --> 48:59.635
No.

49:01.804 --> 49:03.637
I don't kiss and tell.

49:03.639 --> 49:04.740
I believe in discretion.

49:05.807 --> 49:06.909
Well I appreciate it.

49:09.644 --> 49:11.043
But why did it happen?

49:11.045 --> 49:12.278
What do you mean?

49:19.021 --> 49:20.557
You kinda threw
yourself at me.

49:22.190 --> 49:23.893
I wasn't really expecting it.

49:25.561 --> 49:29.162
I was really drunk,
and upset at Dawn.

49:29.164 --> 49:31.100
I guess I wanted
to get back at her.

49:32.166 --> 49:33.934
About what happened
with your sister?

49:33.936 --> 49:36.670
That's the thing, I
don't know what happened.

49:36.672 --> 49:39.873
I just have this hole in
the pit of my stomach.

49:39.875 --> 49:40.844
I can't shake the feeling.

49:44.780 --> 49:46.979
You know, you should
talk to this detective.

49:46.981 --> 49:49.048
Maybe he can dig up
some dirt for you.

49:59.862 --> 50:02.262
This is
Detective Miles Lancaster.

50:02.264 --> 50:04.063
Sorry I missed your
call, but if you leave

50:04.065 --> 50:06.099
your name and number,
I'll get back to you

50:06.101 --> 50:07.833
as soon as possible.

50:09.338 --> 50:11.137
Hi, Detective Lancaster.

50:11.139 --> 50:12.608
This is Robin Hayward.

50:14.943 --> 50:18.644
I needed to talk to you, in
regards to Jessica's death.

50:18.646 --> 50:20.079
I may have some
information that could help

50:20.081 --> 50:21.981
with the investigation.

50:21.983 --> 50:24.653
If you could give me a
call back, that'd be great.

50:28.590 --> 50:32.124
She severed both the
Ulnar artery and the radial

50:32.126 --> 50:33.862
artery in each of her wrists.

50:40.668 --> 50:42.237
Which caused her to bleed out.

50:44.039 --> 50:45.708
I'm so sorry for your
loss, Miss Hayward.

53:16.891 --> 53:18.992
What's the rush, Alex?

53:18.994 --> 53:19.896
It's nothing.

53:21.028 --> 53:22.095
Alex, what's going on?

53:22.097 --> 53:23.896
You've been avoiding me all day.

53:23.898 --> 53:24.467
Have I?

53:27.068 --> 53:28.969
It's not really my place to say.

53:28.971 --> 53:29.871
What is?

53:33.041 --> 53:35.041
I'm just worried about Robin.

53:35.043 --> 53:38.043
I overheard her leaving a
voicemail for the detective.

53:38.045 --> 53:39.181
What did she say?

53:41.250 --> 53:43.950
That she had some information
about Jessica's death.

53:43.952 --> 53:45.488
What kind of information?

53:46.554 --> 53:48.290
I'm not sure exactly.

53:50.025 --> 53:53.025
I bet it's about Jason
and Jessica's relationship.

53:53.027 --> 53:55.262
She got drunk last
night and accused me

53:55.264 --> 53:57.429
of killing Jessica
out of jealousy.

53:57.431 --> 53:59.166
But that's crazy.

53:59.168 --> 54:01.568
I could get arrested for
those kind of accusations.

54:01.570 --> 54:04.470
We need to talk to her before
she says or does something

54:04.472 --> 54:05.775
that she's gonna regret.

54:13.014 --> 54:14.313
Dr. Zimmerman?

54:14.315 --> 54:16.051
Detective Lancaster
is here to see you.

54:21.222 --> 54:22.224
Send him in.

54:26.128 --> 54:27.463
Come in, Detective, come in.

54:30.032 --> 54:32.535
A warrant, for Jessica
Hayward's personal files.

54:38.172 --> 54:39.107
Very well.

54:40.275 --> 54:42.244
These are her files
from the past year.

54:43.579 --> 54:46.278
I'll have to get the
rest from storage.

54:46.280 --> 54:47.947
I hope these help.

54:47.949 --> 54:49.152
Thank you, Doctor.

54:51.253 --> 54:53.019
Detective, before you leave,

54:53.021 --> 54:54.954
I'd like to ask you a question.

54:54.956 --> 54:56.523
Yes?

54:56.525 --> 54:58.858
Given your personal history
with Jessica Hayward...

54:58.860 --> 55:00.594
Personal history?

55:00.596 --> 55:01.864
The fire.

55:03.498 --> 55:05.300
You lost a son that day.

55:06.501 --> 55:09.034
I wouldn't want your
grief interfering

55:09.036 --> 55:11.403
with the integrity of
Miss Hayward's case.

55:11.405 --> 55:13.405
Only reason that would happen

55:13.407 --> 55:16.045
is if Miss Hayward
caused the fire.

55:17.646 --> 55:21.882
The church burned down
due to a lightning storm.

55:21.884 --> 55:23.019
They found no proof of arson.

55:24.119 --> 55:24.954
Of course.

55:28.891 --> 55:30.226
Good luck, Detective.

55:38.467 --> 55:41.070
Hi, Detective Lancaster,
this is Robin Hayward.

55:43.905 --> 55:47.606
I needed to talk to in
regards to Jessica's death.

55:47.608 --> 55:49.108
What do we even say to her?

55:49.110 --> 55:50.309
How about "mind your
own fucking business

55:50.311 --> 55:52.244
and don't say something that
could get us all arrested?"

55:52.246 --> 55:54.380
How was your affair
gonna get us all arrested?

55:54.382 --> 55:56.282
You best believe
if I'm going down,

55:56.284 --> 55:58.284
I'm taking all of
you guys with me.

55:58.286 --> 56:00.353
What the hell is
wrong with you, Dawn?

56:00.355 --> 56:01.554
It's not like you to be so

56:01.556 --> 56:03.123
- Sadistic.
- Yeah.

56:03.125 --> 56:04.490
What's the matter with you?

56:04.492 --> 56:06.293
What, I'm not
allowed to be pissed

56:06.295 --> 56:07.494
when someone accuses
me of murder?

56:07.496 --> 56:08.628
That is not what we're saying.

56:08.630 --> 56:10.362
Well hear what I'm saying.

56:10.364 --> 56:12.965
Any one of you speaks out
against me with the detective,

56:12.967 --> 56:14.967
and you're all gonna regret it.

56:14.969 --> 56:17.037
So what do we do about Robin?

56:17.039 --> 56:18.938
How do we get her to
keep her mouth shut

56:18.940 --> 56:20.673
about Jessica and Jason?

56:20.675 --> 56:23.275
We can't let the cops
find out about the affair.

56:23.277 --> 56:25.577
We can't let the cops
find out about the church.

56:25.579 --> 56:27.079
Why would she say
anything about that?

56:27.081 --> 56:29.516
Because Robin's really angry,

56:29.518 --> 56:31.450
and clearly not thinking right.

56:31.452 --> 56:32.952
She doesn't even know
that the detective

56:32.954 --> 56:34.220
was there when it happened.

56:34.222 --> 56:36.990
She clearly wants
someone to blame

56:36.992 --> 56:38.258
for what happened to Jessica.

56:38.260 --> 56:39.659
What if she does say something?

56:39.661 --> 56:41.094
Would she really
do that, though?

56:41.096 --> 56:42.063
Do what?

56:45.300 --> 56:47.467
Tell the detective how
we burned down the church

56:47.469 --> 56:49.001
when we were kids?

56:49.003 --> 56:51.503
Or how Dawn murdered my sister

56:51.505 --> 56:54.206
because her husband couldn't
keep it in his pants?

56:54.208 --> 56:56.543
I didn't fucking
murder your sister,

56:56.545 --> 56:58.411
so you'd better not
bring any of this shit up

56:58.413 --> 56:59.681
with the detective, or else.

57:01.750 --> 57:03.249
Or else what?

57:03.251 --> 57:05.385
Or else I'll tell them
that you killed Jessica

57:05.387 --> 57:07.119
and tried to put this all on me.

57:07.121 --> 57:08.621
Why would I want
to kill Jessica?

57:08.623 --> 57:10.255
Oh, come on, Robin.

57:10.257 --> 57:12.358
We all know you
resented Jessica.

57:12.360 --> 57:15.095
She was the golden child
who could do no wrong,

57:15.097 --> 57:17.764
and that pissed you
off, so you left,

57:17.766 --> 57:19.566
and when you couldn't even
hack it in the military,

57:19.568 --> 57:22.369
your parents disowned you.

57:22.371 --> 57:25.438
And when they died, they
left everything to Jessica.

57:25.440 --> 57:27.039
They didn't leave you anything,

57:27.041 --> 57:28.675
because you're a waste of skin.

57:28.677 --> 57:29.679
You don't know shit.

57:30.679 --> 57:32.746
So shut your fuckin' mouth.

57:32.748 --> 57:35.581
You had nothing,
and when Jessica died,

57:35.583 --> 57:38.351
you inherited everything.

57:38.353 --> 57:42.521
You've got just as much a
motive to want her dead as I do,

57:42.523 --> 57:44.993
so you better not say
anything to the detective.

57:48.130 --> 57:50.262
Miss Hayward, it's
Detective Lancaster.

57:50.264 --> 57:51.630
Is everything all
right in there?

57:51.632 --> 57:53.233
Shit, what if he heard us?

57:53.235 --> 57:55.367
Relax, we don't
know if he heard

57:55.369 --> 57:59.375
exactly what we were talking
about, so just calm down.

58:05.380 --> 58:06.545
Detective.

58:06.547 --> 58:08.648
I heard yelling.
Is everything all right?

58:08.650 --> 58:11.217
It's great.
Just having a little argument.

58:11.219 --> 58:13.653
Nothing to concern
yourself with.

58:13.655 --> 58:15.789
Is Robin Hayward here?
I need to speak with her.

58:15.791 --> 58:17.389
Of course.

58:17.391 --> 58:18.426
Come on in.

58:23.697 --> 58:25.164
Ms. Hayward.

58:25.166 --> 58:26.434
I got your message.

58:28.670 --> 58:31.570
If you like, I can take
you down to the station,

58:31.572 --> 58:34.042
and you can make a
statement on the record.

58:35.577 --> 58:37.146
Ehm-

58:39.648 --> 58:41.815
I'm sorry to waste your time.

58:41.817 --> 58:43.682
I made a mistake.

58:43.684 --> 58:45.621
I was just about to call
you to clear things up.

58:47.155 --> 58:49.456
What is it you
were gonna tell me?

58:49.458 --> 58:50.726
It's nothing.

58:52.226 --> 58:58.498
I thought I remembered
Jessica get into a fight

58:58.500 --> 59:02.267
with someone before she
died, and then I remembered

59:02.269 --> 59:05.574
I was really drunk and can
never get my story straight.

59:06.740 --> 59:07.509
I see.

59:09.244 --> 59:13.215
And this person you thought
Jessica was fighting with.

59:15.117 --> 59:16.252
Was this a friend of hers?

59:17.719 --> 59:18.820
I don't know.

59:20.355 --> 59:22.488
When I drink,
things get jumbled.

59:22.490 --> 59:26.394
I know you women
are hiding something,

59:27.862 --> 59:29.565
and if you're not
willing to tell me,

59:30.898 --> 59:34.135
I assure you, I will
uncover the truth.

01:00:18.413 --> 01:00:21.180
Good job, Robin, now the
detective is suspicious of us.

01:00:21.182 --> 01:00:22.251
I know.

01:00:22.817 --> 01:00:23.885
I fucked up.

01:00:25.420 --> 01:00:26.719
I don't know what
I was thinking.

01:00:26.721 --> 01:00:28.387
Maybe you should learn
to keep your mouth shut.

01:00:28.389 --> 01:00:30.190
I got it, Dawn, but
maybe you should learn

01:00:30.192 --> 01:00:32.325
to shut your fucking mouth
before I shut it for you.

01:00:32.327 --> 01:00:34.530
Okay, okay guys, let's
just take it down a notch.

01:00:35.530 --> 01:00:37.697
We can't turn on each other.

01:00:37.699 --> 01:00:39.965
Especially with the
cops watching us now.

01:00:39.967 --> 01:00:41.501
She's right.

01:00:41.503 --> 01:00:43.702
We need to have each
other's backs right now.

01:00:44.639 --> 01:00:46.142
Oh, who the fuck is that now?

01:00:53.715 --> 01:00:55.447
It's okay, guys.

01:00:55.449 --> 01:00:56.583
It's just Samuel.

01:00:56.585 --> 01:00:57.519
Hey ladies.

01:00:58.652 --> 01:01:00.452
Why does it feel
so tense in here?

01:01:00.454 --> 01:01:02.255
What's going on.

01:01:02.257 --> 01:01:04.757
It's just the detective drilling
us about Jessica's death.

01:01:04.759 --> 01:01:06.758
Does he still think
that it wasn't a suicide?

01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:08.494
Yeah.

01:01:08.496 --> 01:01:11.296
Well I'm sure the truth will
come out eventually, right?

01:01:11.298 --> 01:01:12.898
Anyways, the reason
that I came over

01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:14.666
was I wanted to talk to...

01:01:14.668 --> 01:01:17.338
Oh, Samuel, now is not a
good time, can we talk later?

01:01:18.606 --> 01:01:20.576
Actually, I wanted
to talk to Gwen.

01:01:23.612 --> 01:01:26.012
Me?
Why?

01:01:26.014 --> 01:01:28.380
Well, I wanted to
interview you, for my book.

01:01:28.382 --> 01:01:31.483
I want one of the characters
to be a musician, so-

01:01:31.485 --> 01:01:32.387
Wow, really?

01:01:33.487 --> 01:01:35.190
That would be so cool.

01:01:35.889 --> 01:01:37.292
Ehmm-

01:01:38.927 --> 01:01:41.360
Now is not the
best time for this.

01:01:41.362 --> 01:01:43.996
Hey, I could use a distraction
from all of our drama.

01:01:43.998 --> 01:01:45.597
I just don't
think we should be

01:01:45.599 --> 01:01:46.932
talking to anyone right now.

01:01:46.934 --> 01:01:48.800
We don't even know this guy.

01:01:48.802 --> 01:01:50.769
Relax, Maggie, it'll be fine.

01:01:50.771 --> 01:01:52.474
You should quit
worrying so much.

01:01:54.643 --> 01:01:56.508
Is there a
private place we can talk?

01:01:56.510 --> 01:01:58.043
Yeah, there's a great spot
upstairs we can talk in.

01:01:58.045 --> 01:01:59.414
Oh, great.

01:02:07.054 --> 01:02:08.887
So how long have
you been a musician?

01:02:08.889 --> 01:02:11.423
Well, I've been playing
guitar since I was nine.

01:02:11.425 --> 01:02:14.262
I joined a band when I was 16,
bounced around a little bit.

01:02:15.896 --> 01:02:18.463
And you performed with
your last band for how long?

01:02:18.465 --> 01:02:20.932
About seven years?

01:02:20.934 --> 01:02:23.605
We toured for a while
before they kicked me out.

01:02:24.806 --> 01:02:25.574
Again.

01:02:28.309 --> 01:02:29.411
Sorry about that.

01:02:30.612 --> 01:02:31.644
But if it's all right with you,

01:02:31.646 --> 01:02:33.882
I'd like to talk about
your gambling problems.

01:02:34.983 --> 01:02:37.083
Is this gonna go in your book?

01:02:37.085 --> 01:02:38.818
No.

01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:39.922
I'm just brainstorming.

01:02:49.864 --> 01:02:52.865
Well, I guess it all started

01:02:52.867 --> 01:02:55.271
when we did a tour
through Vegas.

01:02:56.670 --> 01:02:59.040
I gambled every night
that we were there.

01:03:00.842 --> 01:03:02.878
I stole all the band's
money and gambled it away.

01:03:04.545 --> 01:03:07.315
I lost almost five
grand that week.

01:03:08.615 --> 01:03:10.351
And it got a lot worse.

01:03:11.786 --> 01:03:13.653
A few times a month, Jessica
would come down and join me,

01:03:13.655 --> 01:03:15.588
and we would gamble
away more money.

01:03:15.590 --> 01:03:16.625
Jessica gambled too?

01:03:18.393 --> 01:03:20.992
I actually got her into it.

01:03:20.994 --> 01:03:22.797
But don't tell the
others though, okay?

01:03:27.068 --> 01:03:28.900
I don't mean to pry.

01:03:28.902 --> 01:03:30.938
I'm just interested in you.

01:03:33.875 --> 01:03:34.742
That's okay.

01:03:36.543 --> 01:03:37.980
I feel oddly
comfortable around you.

01:03:40.815 --> 01:03:44.550
It's weird, I don't talk about
this kinda stuff with anyone.

01:03:44.552 --> 01:03:47.823
Maybe we just
understand each other.

01:04:07.141 --> 01:04:08.907
Man.

01:04:08.909 --> 01:04:10.913
Gwen and Samuel have
been talking for a while.

01:04:12.414 --> 01:04:13.649
Are you jealous?

01:04:14.949 --> 01:04:16.782
Of course not.

01:04:16.784 --> 01:04:19.418
What Samuel and I had was
nothing more than a fling.

01:04:19.420 --> 01:04:20.920
Yeah, right.

01:04:20.922 --> 01:04:22.954
Who are you trying to
convince, us or yourself?

01:04:22.956 --> 01:04:24.423
Shut up, Robin.

01:04:30.030 --> 01:04:32.865
Oh, guys get a
lot accomplished?

01:04:32.867 --> 01:04:35.200
Oh, our time was
very productive.

01:04:35.202 --> 01:04:38.037
In fact, I'm gonna head home
right now, work on my story.

01:04:38.039 --> 01:04:39.704
Sure you don't want
to stay for supper?

01:04:39.706 --> 01:04:41.474
No, I should
probably get home.

01:04:41.476 --> 01:04:43.476
But thanks for
talking to me, Gwen.

01:04:43.478 --> 01:04:44.613
Ladies, enjoy your night.

01:04:46.181 --> 01:04:49.449
So, what did you
two talk about?

01:04:49.451 --> 01:04:50.853
Just my life as a musician.

01:04:52.853 --> 01:04:54.088
And that's it?

01:04:55.789 --> 01:04:56.692
Yeah.

01:04:58.559 --> 01:05:00.592
Don't lie to me, Gwen.

01:05:00.594 --> 01:05:02.728
We been friends for a long time.

01:05:02.730 --> 01:05:05.898
You don't think that I know
what your sex hair looks like?

01:05:05.900 --> 01:05:07.733
You guys had sex?!

01:05:07.735 --> 01:05:08.867
A little bit.

01:05:08.869 --> 01:05:10.068
What the fuck, Gwen?!

01:05:10.070 --> 01:05:11.470
I thought we were friends.

01:05:11.472 --> 01:05:13.005
How could you do that to me?

01:05:13.007 --> 01:05:15.141
I thought you and Samuel
were nothing more than a fling.

01:05:15.143 --> 01:05:16.775
Okay, stay out of this, Robin.

01:05:16.777 --> 01:05:18.610
This has nothing to do with you.

01:05:18.612 --> 01:05:20.045
Well, it kinda does.

01:05:20.047 --> 01:05:21.880
What do you mean?

01:05:21.882 --> 01:05:24.249
Well I didn't think I was
gonna have to say anything,

01:05:24.251 --> 01:05:26.084
but the other night I came
downstairs to get some water

01:05:26.086 --> 01:05:29.090
and I saw Robin and
Samuel on the couch.

01:05:32.059 --> 01:05:33.258
Doing it?

01:05:33.260 --> 01:05:35.695
What the fuck, Robin?

01:05:35.697 --> 01:05:36.862
You saw us?

01:05:36.864 --> 01:05:39.499
Why didn't you
say anything, Alex?

01:05:39.501 --> 01:05:41.233
Why does it have to be
my place to say anything?

01:05:41.235 --> 01:05:42.702
It's not my fault
you guys are just

01:05:42.704 --> 01:05:43.936
throwing yourselves at this guy.

01:05:43.938 --> 01:05:46.905
Oh, screw you, Alex.

01:05:46.907 --> 01:05:49.742
You think you're so much
better than all of us.

01:05:49.744 --> 01:05:52.211
Always trying to make
us feel sorry for you.

01:05:52.213 --> 01:05:54.514
Wait, how did I
become the bad guy?

01:05:54.516 --> 01:05:55.748
Where is this coming from?

01:05:55.750 --> 01:05:58.918
You're always playing
the sympathy card.

01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:00.889
Ever since you found
Jessica dead in the tub.

01:06:02.222 --> 01:06:04.125
Maybe you should just
get over yourself.

01:06:15.235 --> 01:06:17.638
Dawn, what the hell
is wrong with you?

01:06:20.875 --> 01:06:21.643
Alex!

01:06:24.811 --> 01:06:25.681
Alex!

01:06:29.182 --> 01:06:31.182
Alex, where are you?

01:06:31.184 --> 01:06:32.684
What's going on?

01:06:32.686 --> 01:06:33.853
Dawn said something
that really upset Alex,

01:06:33.855 --> 01:06:35.655
and now I can't find her.

01:06:35.657 --> 01:06:37.155
I'll help you look for her.

01:06:37.157 --> 01:06:38.124
Okay.

01:06:38.126 --> 01:06:39.858
Alex!

01:06:39.860 --> 01:06:40.628
Alex!

01:06:45.166 --> 01:06:47.733
I can't believe you
guys both slept with him.

01:06:47.735 --> 01:06:49.834
You're such a bunch of
backstabbing bitches.

01:06:49.836 --> 01:06:51.304
Fuck you, Dawn.

01:06:51.306 --> 01:06:53.572
You're the biggest slut here.

01:06:53.574 --> 01:06:55.807
Almost as much as your
trampy-ass husband.

01:06:55.809 --> 01:06:57.208
Screw you, Robin.

01:06:57.210 --> 01:06:58.878
You act like you're
so innocent, Dawn,

01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:00.780
but you are just
as bad as Jason.

01:07:00.782 --> 01:07:02.180
Oh, and you're
so perfect, Gwen?

01:07:02.182 --> 01:07:05.150
You pretend like you're
so cool and chill,

01:07:05.152 --> 01:07:07.253
but you're actually so insecure.

01:07:07.255 --> 01:07:08.354
I am not!

01:07:08.356 --> 01:07:09.789
God.

01:07:09.791 --> 01:07:11.727
You two are so
whiny and dramatic.

01:07:14.027 --> 01:07:15.296
I can't handle it anymore.

01:07:18.865 --> 01:07:20.266
Alex!

01:07:20.268 --> 01:07:20.835
Alex!

01:07:23.036 --> 01:07:24.272
Where could she have gone?

01:07:26.039 --> 01:07:27.576
I'm sure she can
take care of herself.

01:07:28.909 --> 01:07:30.045
I just worry about her.

01:07:31.346 --> 01:07:33.215
You know, Jessica's death
really messed her up.

01:07:35.617 --> 01:07:37.920
They were best friends,
they did everything together.

01:07:40.221 --> 01:07:43.891
I think she blames herself
for Jessica's suicide.

01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:47.827
So you still think
it was a suicide?

01:07:47.829 --> 01:07:48.597
Of course.

01:07:54.268 --> 01:07:57.802
The fact that Jessica was
going through all of that

01:07:57.804 --> 01:07:59.707
and none of us even noticed.

01:08:02.210 --> 01:08:06.581
Well, the unexamined
life is not worth living.

01:08:10.652 --> 01:08:12.186
You know, you're
actually very wise.

01:08:13.954 --> 01:08:15.856
I can see why the
others like you so much.

01:08:18.259 --> 01:08:19.926
Come on, Alex,
answer your phone.

01:08:23.264 --> 01:08:26.398
I hope your husband knows
how lucky he is to have you.

01:08:26.399 --> 01:08:27.666
Stop.

01:08:27.667 --> 01:08:28.834
Come on, Maggie.

01:08:28.836 --> 01:08:31.136
Not only are you
beautiful, you're nice,

01:08:31.139 --> 01:08:32.872
you're nurturing,
you're generous.

01:08:36.010 --> 01:08:38.710
I think that you're
the glue that holds

01:08:38.712 --> 01:08:40.014
your group of friends together.

01:08:41.048 --> 01:08:42.082
You really think that?

01:08:43.783 --> 01:08:44.318
I really do.

01:08:48.354 --> 01:08:50.221
We shouldn't.

01:08:50.224 --> 01:08:51.389
We should.

01:08:58.832 --> 01:09:02.100
Maggie, what the
hell are you doing?

01:09:02.103 --> 01:09:03.372
Sorry, I should really go.

01:09:06.106 --> 01:09:08.073
Honestly, I don't even
know what came over me,

01:09:08.076 --> 01:09:11.042
I mean, one minute, we
were talking, and the next,

01:09:11.045 --> 01:09:13.044
I don't even know
how this happened!

01:09:13.046 --> 01:09:15.814
It's like I wasn't even
in control of my body.

01:09:15.817 --> 01:09:17.716
You won't say anything,
will you Robin?

01:09:17.719 --> 01:09:20.255
You know, I thought you were
more responsible than this.

01:09:21.756 --> 01:09:23.221
But it turns out,
you're just as fucked up

01:09:23.224 --> 01:09:24.956
as the rest of us.

01:09:33.868 --> 01:09:35.500
Hey Alex, are you all right?

01:09:35.502 --> 01:09:36.871
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:09:37.270 --> 01:09:38.504
Do you wanna
talk about it?

01:09:38.506 --> 01:09:39.839
Not really.

01:09:39.841 --> 01:09:41.743
Robin said Dawn upset you.

01:09:49.417 --> 01:09:50.385
Is this about Jessica?

01:09:52.252 --> 01:09:55.019
Look, just because
everybody else comes to you

01:09:55.021 --> 01:09:57.458
with all of their problems,
doesn't mean I'm going to.

01:09:59.926 --> 01:10:01.028
Why don't you just
leave me alone?

01:10:03.197 --> 01:10:03.899
I just wanna help.

01:10:04.931 --> 01:10:06.300
Well I don't need your help.

01:10:07.902 --> 01:10:10.971
You know, it's
okay to feel angry.

01:10:12.239 --> 01:10:15.042
Dealing with suicide
can be challenging.

01:10:17.043 --> 01:10:20.111
When people fall to such a
low place in their lives,

01:10:20.113 --> 01:10:23.048
it's unfortunate to know
that they think suicide

01:10:23.050 --> 01:10:24.252
is the only way out.

01:10:27.889 --> 01:10:32.194
There's but one philosophical
problem, and that is suicide.

01:10:34.395 --> 01:10:36.198
Did you just quote
Albert Camus to me?

01:10:37.532 --> 01:10:39.234
Very good, you know
your philosophers.

01:10:40.868 --> 01:10:42.771
And here I thought you
were only into poetry.

01:10:44.104 --> 01:10:45.906
Why is Edgar Allen Poe
your favourite poet?

01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:48.242
Well,

01:10:51.011 --> 01:10:55.382
I just love how dark
and unique his writing is.

01:10:56.484 --> 01:10:59.221
All of his
stories are so-

01:11:00.054 --> 01:11:01.757
mysterious,

01:11:02.523 --> 01:11:04.126
full of emotion, drama.

01:11:05.393 --> 01:11:07.058
He does have a
recurring theme of death

01:11:07.060 --> 01:11:09.428
and lost love to his
writing, doesn't he?

01:11:09.430 --> 01:11:10.198
Yeah.

01:11:14.868 --> 01:11:16.804
Maybe that's something
you can relate to?

01:11:19.073 --> 01:11:21.243
You know, he was Jessica's
favourite poet as well.

01:11:25.112 --> 01:11:27.111
When we were younger,

01:11:27.113 --> 01:11:31.616
we used to hide pages of his
poems in our bibles at church,

01:11:31.618 --> 01:11:34.121
so we'd have something
interesting to read.

01:11:36.189 --> 01:11:40.194
My father found out,
burned all of my copies,

01:11:41.194 --> 01:11:42.898
hit me with his own Bible.

01:11:44.064 --> 01:11:46.898
Hit me so hard he broke
two of my fingers.

01:11:53.173 --> 01:11:54.639
Why did I just tell you that?

01:11:54.641 --> 01:11:56.144
I've never told anyone that.

01:11:57.278 --> 01:11:59.445
Because it feels
good to tell the truth.

01:11:59.447 --> 01:12:02.417
Secrets and lies
poison the soul, but-

01:12:03.618 --> 01:12:05.284
you know that.

01:12:37.918 --> 01:12:39.218
Dr. Zimmerman.

01:12:39.220 --> 01:12:41.452
It's Detective Lancaster.

01:12:41.454 --> 01:12:42.955
Hello, Detective.

01:12:42.957 --> 01:12:45.324
I know it's late,
but I found something

01:12:45.326 --> 01:12:48.559
in Jessica's files that
may lead somewhere.

01:12:48.561 --> 01:12:50.495
You've written down
here that one of

01:12:50.497 --> 01:12:52.964
the therapeutic
techniques you used

01:12:52.966 --> 01:12:55.000
that has been helping
with Ms. Hayward

01:12:55.002 --> 01:12:58.306
is writing down thoughts
and dreams in journals.

01:12:59.239 --> 01:13:01.507
Would you happen to know
where these journals might be?

01:13:01.509 --> 01:13:02.375
Yes.

01:13:02.377 --> 01:13:05.009
She would give them
to me to store.

01:13:05.011 --> 01:13:06.512
Didn't trust her
family and friends

01:13:06.514 --> 01:13:09.080
not to snoop and read her
personal thoughts and feelings.

01:13:09.082 --> 01:13:11.215
I believe they're with
the rest of her files.

01:13:11.217 --> 01:13:14.119
Did you happen to read
any of these journals?

01:13:14.121 --> 01:13:17.423
Usually I'd want to read what
a patient would write down.

01:13:17.425 --> 01:13:19.223
But she wanted them
to remain private,

01:13:19.225 --> 01:13:21.360
and I respected her wishes.

01:13:21.362 --> 01:13:24.696
When was the last time she
gave you one of these journals?

01:13:24.698 --> 01:13:28.200
Around the time her
parents passed away.

01:13:28.202 --> 01:13:32.007
Doctor, I need to see
these journals, immediately.

01:14:08.743 --> 01:14:10.342
Jessica?

01:14:10.344 --> 01:14:12.079
Alex.

01:14:19.619 --> 01:14:21.253
Alex.

01:14:21.255 --> 01:14:23.054
Alex.

01:14:23.056 --> 01:14:24.555
Alex.

01:14:24.557 --> 01:14:26.357
Are you okay?

01:14:26.359 --> 01:14:28.160
We've been looking
everywhere for you.

01:14:28.162 --> 01:14:30.228
We've been worried sick.

01:14:30.230 --> 01:14:31.597
Yeah right.

01:14:31.599 --> 01:14:33.531
Don't be
like that, Alex.

01:14:33.533 --> 01:14:35.701
You have no idea
what I'm going through.

01:14:35.703 --> 01:14:37.669
None of you do.

01:14:37.671 --> 01:14:39.641
I see Jessica everywhere.

01:14:41.375 --> 01:14:43.275
I can't sleep, I can't even
use the upstairs bathroom

01:14:43.277 --> 01:14:45.277
without seeing her
dead body in the tub.

01:14:45.279 --> 01:14:49.415
Alex, I'm sorry about
what I said earlier.

01:14:49.417 --> 01:14:52.550
Dawn, don't bother
apologizing, I don't need it.

01:14:52.552 --> 01:14:55.521
You all have your issues
you need to deal with,

01:14:55.523 --> 01:14:57.688
so just leave me and
my problems alone.

01:14:57.690 --> 01:15:00.228
What problems are you
talking about, Alex?

01:15:02.262 --> 01:15:05.164
You don't honestly
believe that Jessica

01:15:05.166 --> 01:15:06.467
didn't tell me everything.

01:15:07.501 --> 01:15:08.733
What do you mean?

01:15:08.735 --> 01:15:11.335
Don't play dumb, Gwen.

01:15:11.337 --> 01:15:12.704
You think I don't know
about the gambling problem

01:15:12.706 --> 01:15:14.238
you and Jessica got into?

01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:15.307
What gambling problem?

01:15:15.309 --> 01:15:16.708
You knew about that?

01:15:16.710 --> 01:15:18.477
Of course I did!

01:15:18.479 --> 01:15:20.579
Jessica told me everything!

01:15:20.581 --> 01:15:22.647
We were best friends.

01:15:22.649 --> 01:15:24.583
You got my sister
into gambling?

01:15:24.585 --> 01:15:27.518
Is this what caused Jessica
to get into such bad debt?

01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:29.254
Yeah, Gwen got her
into so much debt,

01:15:29.256 --> 01:15:31.290
she had to borrow
10 grand from Maggie.

01:15:31.292 --> 01:15:32.424
She borrowed money from you?

01:15:32.426 --> 01:15:35.360
Yeah, and she
never paid me back.

01:15:35.362 --> 01:15:38.296
When Brian found out, it
almost ruined our marriage.

01:15:38.298 --> 01:15:40.199
At least she didn't
steal it from you.

01:15:40.201 --> 01:15:42.267
Jessica
stole money from you?

01:15:42.269 --> 01:15:43.735
The last time
we were in Vegas,

01:15:43.737 --> 01:15:47.438
she stole $10,000 of my
winnings and gambled it away.

01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:50.209
I needed that money to
pay back my own debt.

01:15:50.211 --> 01:15:52.443
That sounds like something
you'd kill someone over.

01:15:52.445 --> 01:15:54.479
Are you fucking
kidding me, Robin?

01:15:54.481 --> 01:15:56.815
Are you seriously accusing
me of murdering Jessica

01:15:56.817 --> 01:15:58.750
because she stole
some money from me?

01:15:58.752 --> 01:16:00.686
Some money?

01:16:00.688 --> 01:16:02.387
Try ten thousand, Gwen.

01:16:02.389 --> 01:16:04.289
What's your point, Dawn?

01:16:04.291 --> 01:16:07.793
I'd be pretty pissed if
someone stole 10 grand from me.

01:16:07.795 --> 01:16:09.561
Almost as angry as you
were when you found out

01:16:09.563 --> 01:16:11.763
that Jessica was sleeping
with your husband?

01:16:11.765 --> 01:16:13.799
Haven't we moved past this?

01:16:13.801 --> 01:16:15.666
Of course we haven't.

01:16:15.668 --> 01:16:18.469
First I find out Jessica's
death might not be a suicide,

01:16:18.471 --> 01:16:20.371
and now I'm finding out
all of you have reason

01:16:20.373 --> 01:16:22.141
to have wanted her dead?

01:16:22.143 --> 01:16:24.576
What, like you didn't have
a reason to want her dead?

01:16:24.578 --> 01:16:27.545
Don't you dare bring up
that whole inheritance thing.

01:16:27.547 --> 01:16:28.849
I loved my sister.

01:16:30.518 --> 01:16:31.685
But did you really?

01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:35.486
Come on.

01:16:35.488 --> 01:16:37.421
All this is proving
is how little

01:16:37.423 --> 01:16:39.790
you actually knew your sister.

01:16:39.792 --> 01:16:42.393
You weren't there for her.

01:16:42.395 --> 01:16:47.266
And if this was a suicide,
you're most likely the reason

01:16:47.268 --> 01:16:49.636
as to why she killed
herself in the first place.

01:16:53.606 --> 01:16:55.743
I don't think
Jessica killed herself.

01:16:57.545 --> 01:16:59.410
I can feel it.

01:16:59.412 --> 01:17:01.479
You really believe
we're capable of murder?

01:17:01.481 --> 01:17:02.680
We are murderers, Maggie.

01:17:02.682 --> 01:17:04.348
Just admit it to yourself.

01:17:04.350 --> 01:17:06.184
That wasn't murder, Robin.

01:17:06.186 --> 01:17:07.585
That was an accident.

01:17:07.587 --> 01:17:09.187
We're all going to hell.

01:17:09.189 --> 01:17:10.555
Might as well own it, right?

01:17:10.557 --> 01:17:12.523
You've lost your
goddamn mind, Robin.

01:17:12.525 --> 01:17:13.925
Have I?

01:17:13.927 --> 01:17:15.660
Because you've yet to
deny killing Jessica.

01:17:15.662 --> 01:17:17.696
You really need
to hear me say it?

01:17:17.698 --> 01:17:20.699
Fine, I didn't kill Jessica.

01:17:20.701 --> 01:17:22.701
Why would I?

01:17:22.703 --> 01:17:25.269
She borrowed money from
me and didn't pay me back?

01:17:25.271 --> 01:17:27.238
Come on, Robin, get your
head out of your ass!

01:17:27.240 --> 01:17:28.740
Oh, fuck you, Maggie.

01:17:28.742 --> 01:17:30.576
Maybe your marriage almost ended

01:17:30.578 --> 01:17:33.579
because you're just as much
of a slut as the rest of us.

01:17:33.581 --> 01:17:34.446
What?

01:17:34.448 --> 01:17:35.813
Yeah.

01:17:35.815 --> 01:17:37.749
Maggie and Samuel
would've fucked earlier

01:17:37.751 --> 01:17:38.784
if I hadn't interrupted them.

01:17:38.786 --> 01:17:40.986
Oh my god, really Maggie?

01:17:40.988 --> 01:17:44.289
It was just a kiss, just
one, and it meant nothing.

01:17:44.291 --> 01:17:46.327
You try to pretend
to be Miss Perfect.

01:17:47.394 --> 01:17:48.927
But you're not.

01:17:48.929 --> 01:17:51.562
Well at least I don't run
from my problems like a coward.

01:17:51.564 --> 01:17:53.732
You asking for
another shot, bitch?

01:17:53.734 --> 01:17:54.900
Guys.

01:17:54.902 --> 01:17:56.434
Calm down.

01:17:56.436 --> 01:17:58.637
Jessica wouldn't want
us to fight like this.

01:17:58.639 --> 01:18:00.708
But she would want us to
be honest with each other.

01:18:03.510 --> 01:18:05.244
You know what?

01:18:05.246 --> 01:18:06.945
You guys aren't worth my time.

01:18:06.947 --> 01:18:09.248
I want you all out of the house
first thing in the morning.

01:18:09.250 --> 01:18:10.348
Robin, don't be like that.

01:18:10.350 --> 01:18:11.316
No.

01:18:11.318 --> 01:18:12.683
Fuck you guys.

01:18:12.685 --> 01:18:15.019
None of you were true
friends to my sister.

01:18:15.021 --> 01:18:17.856
She would've been better
off without all of you.

01:18:17.858 --> 01:18:19.961
Oh, and you're so much
better than we are, Robin?

01:18:21.694 --> 01:18:23.361
You wanna know the truth?

01:18:23.363 --> 01:18:27.933
The truth is your sister
deserved what she got.

01:18:27.935 --> 01:18:29.404
What the fuck
did you just say?

01:18:30.570 --> 01:18:32.803
I said Jessica
deserved to die.

01:18:32.805 --> 01:18:34.839
She fucked over her friends.

01:18:34.841 --> 01:18:36.308
She ruined my marriage.

01:18:36.310 --> 01:18:37.909
She almost ruined mine too.

01:18:37.911 --> 01:18:39.544
She stole all my money.

01:18:39.546 --> 01:18:40.981
You're all terrible people!

01:18:42.548 --> 01:18:43.749
You selfish assholes.

01:18:43.751 --> 01:18:45.851
Take responsibility
for your own mistakes

01:18:45.853 --> 01:18:47.322
instead of blaming someone else.

01:18:49.590 --> 01:18:52.723
Dawn, Jessica never
slept with Jason.

01:18:52.725 --> 01:18:56.027
Jason cheated on you because
of your selfish attitude.

01:18:56.029 --> 01:18:58.863
And Maggie, maybe you
should've asked your husband

01:18:58.865 --> 01:19:00.766
before loaning Jessica $10,000,

01:19:00.768 --> 01:19:02.000
instead of just
giving it to her.

01:19:02.002 --> 01:19:04.936
Your marriage didn't suffer
because Jessica took that money.

01:19:04.938 --> 01:19:06.338
It suffered because
you and Brian

01:19:06.340 --> 01:19:07.708
don't know how to communicate.

01:19:09.342 --> 01:19:12.477
Gwen, you were the
one who got Jessica

01:19:12.479 --> 01:19:13.812
into gambling in
the first place.

01:19:13.814 --> 01:19:16.848
She stole that money to
give it back to Maggie,

01:19:16.850 --> 01:19:18.920
only to lose it to the
thugs that you owed it to.

01:19:23.823 --> 01:19:25.326
Robin,

01:19:27.094 --> 01:19:29.764
you knew how long
Jessica was suffering for.

01:19:30.530 --> 01:19:32.634
That incident at the church
messed her up so much.

01:19:33.734 --> 01:19:34.802
What did you do?

01:19:36.002 --> 01:19:38.605
You left the first
chance you got.

01:19:39.872 --> 01:19:41.106
None of you were there for her.

01:19:41.108 --> 01:19:43.008
I was the only one
who tried to help her.

01:19:43.010 --> 01:19:44.710
I was the only one
who knew exactly

01:19:44.712 --> 01:19:46.047
what she was going through.

01:19:47.715 --> 01:19:50.818
Jessica killed herself
because of all of you.

01:19:55.922 --> 01:19:57.791
Put the gun down, Robin.

01:19:59.592 --> 01:20:01.425
Why didn't you stop her?

01:20:01.427 --> 01:20:05.796
Robin, just calm down
and give me the gun.

01:20:05.798 --> 01:20:07.732
Not until I find
out what happened.

01:20:07.734 --> 01:20:09.036
I just told you!

01:20:15.876 --> 01:20:16.811
- Alex!
- Just let her go.

01:20:35.095 --> 01:20:37.928
Damn, Robin hit
you pretty good.

01:20:37.930 --> 01:20:39.397
Can you believe her?

01:20:39.399 --> 01:20:41.532
She coulda killed us!

01:20:41.534 --> 01:20:44.835
What was she thinking,
bringing out a gun like that?

01:20:44.837 --> 01:20:46.640
Yeah, freaked us all out.

01:20:48.141 --> 01:20:50.444
First thing tomorrow
morning, I'm heading home.

01:20:51.845 --> 01:20:53.514
I don't feel safe
around here anymore.

01:20:54.581 --> 01:20:55.949
I don't blame you.

01:20:57.050 --> 01:21:00.152
Do you think Alex was right
about Jessica stealing

01:21:00.154 --> 01:21:01.789
my winnings to give back to you?

01:21:02.756 --> 01:21:03.490
I don't know.

01:21:05.192 --> 01:21:06.961
Could you
believe Alex, though?

01:21:08.127 --> 01:21:10.161
She just snapped on us.

01:21:10.163 --> 01:21:11.599
Maybe she's right, though.

01:21:13.132 --> 01:21:16.103
Well maybe we aren't taking
responsibility for our actions.

01:21:20.006 --> 01:21:22.809
We just pretend like
it never happened.

01:21:26.479 --> 01:21:29.781
I just blame
others for my mistakes.

01:21:29.783 --> 01:21:32.817
What, like kissing Samuel?

01:21:32.819 --> 01:21:35.519
At least I
didn't have sex with him.

01:21:35.521 --> 01:21:37.822
Unlike you guys who just
threw yourselves at him

01:21:37.824 --> 01:21:39.626
without any
hesitation whatsoever.

01:21:49.168 --> 01:21:50.872
I don't even know
what came over me.

01:21:53.739 --> 01:21:57.744
It's like I wasn't in control
of my thoughts and actions.

01:21:59.145 --> 01:22:00.046
I felt the same way.

01:22:03.149 --> 01:22:04.719
He took advantage of us.

01:22:06.520 --> 01:22:10.088
How can somebody do that and
still manage to sleep at night?

01:22:10.090 --> 01:22:12.089
All the terrible
stuff we've done?

01:22:12.091 --> 01:22:14.060
How is that we can
manage to sleep at night?

01:22:15.929 --> 01:22:18.028
I just thought he
was cool, you know?

01:22:18.030 --> 01:22:20.598
The assholes always manage to

01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:22.804
disguise themselves
as the nice guy.

01:22:24.872 --> 01:22:27.772
It's hard to pick the
angels from the demons.

01:22:44.056 --> 01:22:44.958
Where are you?

01:22:46.193 --> 01:22:47.195
I know you're out here!

01:22:48.929 --> 01:22:51.164
Watching us, playing with us.

01:22:54.100 --> 01:22:55.469
I know who you are!

01:23:07.079 --> 01:23:08.949
Why are you doing this to us?

01:23:10.783 --> 01:23:11.918
You know why.

01:23:13.319 --> 01:23:15.219
The journals should
be in here somewhere.

01:23:15.221 --> 01:23:17.821
Thanks for doing this
so early in the morning.

01:23:17.823 --> 01:23:19.924
It's fine, Detective.

01:23:19.926 --> 01:23:21.192
I wanna know what
happened to my patient

01:23:21.194 --> 01:23:22.994
just as much as you do.

01:23:22.996 --> 01:23:25.696
I appreciate the
help, regardless.

01:23:25.698 --> 01:23:26.600
This should be it.

01:23:27.701 --> 01:23:28.269
Could you?

01:23:32.805 --> 01:23:33.673
Thank you.

01:23:38.845 --> 01:23:39.614
Take a look.

01:23:40.780 --> 01:23:41.748
Thank you.

01:23:45.051 --> 01:23:45.952
Jessica?

01:23:46.819 --> 01:23:48.320
Hello Alex.

01:23:48.322 --> 01:23:49.690
I'm so sorry.

01:23:51.757 --> 01:23:53.625
I did everything I could.

01:23:53.627 --> 01:23:54.962
I did everything
you asked me to.

01:23:56.829 --> 01:23:59.363
I don't understand
why this is happening.

01:23:59.365 --> 01:24:00.898
Yes you do.

01:24:00.900 --> 01:24:02.302
Deep down you know exactly why.

01:24:03.837 --> 01:24:04.772
The church?

01:24:06.939 --> 01:24:14.114
♪ Amazing grace,
how sweet the sound ♪

01:24:15.815 --> 01:24:22.255
♪ That saved a wretch like me ♪

01:24:25.057 --> 01:24:27.157
God, I hate this place.

01:24:27.159 --> 01:24:31.028
I am so tired of my
parents trying to turn me

01:24:31.030 --> 01:24:33.897
into something I'm not.

01:24:33.899 --> 01:24:37.037
I just wish that they would
accept me for who I am,

01:24:39.739 --> 01:24:44.177
but they won't, and it's all
that stupid religion's fault.

01:24:45.177 --> 01:24:46.279
Hey, I feel the same way.

01:24:48.649 --> 01:24:50.147
They'll never accept us.

01:24:50.149 --> 01:24:52.851
Robin and
Jessica, where are you?

01:24:52.853 --> 01:24:53.684
Shit.

01:24:53.686 --> 01:24:54.385
It's Dad.

01:24:54.387 --> 01:24:55.320
Put the fire out!

01:24:55.322 --> 01:24:57.024
It's Dad, come on!

01:24:58.692 --> 01:24:59.292
Robin.

01:25:02.828 --> 01:25:03.730
Alex.

01:25:30.724 --> 01:25:33.394
Lucas!
Lucas, where are you?

01:25:36.829 --> 01:25:37.562
Lucas!

01:25:37.564 --> 01:25:38.996
Miles, we have to go.

01:25:38.998 --> 01:25:41.668
All the kids are
outside, let's go.

01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:48.809
Ow.

01:25:52.746 --> 01:25:53.477
Dad!

01:25:53.479 --> 01:25:55.115
Mommy, where are you?

01:26:11.064 --> 01:26:12.863
Detective?

01:26:12.865 --> 01:26:13.701
What is it?

01:26:14.734 --> 01:26:15.967
It was them.

01:26:15.969 --> 01:26:18.068
Who?

01:26:18.070 --> 01:26:22.876
Jessica, and her friends,
they burned it down.

01:26:23.976 --> 01:26:25.078
The church?

01:26:26.313 --> 01:26:27.014
My son.

01:26:28.314 --> 01:26:30.784
They're the reason
my son is dead.

01:26:32.018 --> 01:26:32.987
Detective.

01:26:35.087 --> 01:26:36.023
Wait.

01:26:39.225 --> 01:26:41.261
You killed those people, Alex.

01:26:43.764 --> 01:26:45.099
A child died because of you.

01:26:47.501 --> 01:26:50.304
And you led me to believe
that it was all my fault.

01:26:51.872 --> 01:26:53.403
I never meant for
anyone to get hurt.

01:26:53.405 --> 01:26:55.906
I just wanted to see
that building burn.

01:26:55.908 --> 01:26:56.775
Like you wanted.

01:26:56.777 --> 01:26:59.009
It's not the
building that we hated.

01:26:59.011 --> 01:27:00.413
It's what the
building represented.

01:27:02.149 --> 01:27:04.385
It was the people that would
sit there and judge us.

01:27:06.552 --> 01:27:09.256
They never would've accepted
us, Jessica, not ever.

01:27:10.323 --> 01:27:11.392
I accepted you, Alex.

01:27:13.292 --> 01:27:14.461
Is that not enough?

01:27:16.029 --> 01:27:18.199
You never loved
me like I loved you.

01:27:35.548 --> 01:27:38.081
You?

01:27:38.083 --> 01:27:39.918
You're the one punishing me?

01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:41.251
Yes.

01:27:41.253 --> 01:27:43.086
I'm punishing all of you.

01:27:43.088 --> 01:27:45.022
Which one of you took it?

01:27:45.024 --> 01:27:45.956
Took what?

01:27:45.958 --> 01:27:46.924
Don't play dumb.

01:27:46.926 --> 01:27:48.459
My gun.

01:27:48.461 --> 01:27:50.829
I put it in my bag and the
next thing you know it's gone.

01:27:50.831 --> 01:27:52.162
How do you lose a gun?

01:27:52.164 --> 01:27:53.330
I didn't lose a gun, Maggie.

01:27:53.332 --> 01:27:54.531
Someone stole it.

01:27:54.533 --> 01:27:56.233
Now who was it?

01:27:56.235 --> 01:27:58.268
We didn't take
your gun, Robin.

01:27:58.270 --> 01:28:00.071
We've been here the whole time.

01:28:00.073 --> 01:28:02.574
Well if you didn't
take it, then who did?

01:28:02.576 --> 01:28:07.113
You are all sinners,
so easily corrupted.

01:28:08.547 --> 01:28:10.184
Even poor sweet Maggie.

01:28:11.551 --> 01:28:14.021
But none of them
compares to you.

01:28:15.154 --> 01:28:17.487
Everything I did,
I did for Jessica.

01:28:17.489 --> 01:28:20.357
Even when she was pretending
to be someone else,

01:28:20.359 --> 01:28:21.561
no matter how bad it got.

01:28:23.063 --> 01:28:24.931
I was the only one who
was truly there for her.

01:28:33.340 --> 01:28:35.242
We have to take all of them.

01:28:50.122 --> 01:28:51.024
Read it to me again.

01:28:52.958 --> 01:28:54.491
Just the ending.

01:28:54.493 --> 01:28:55.194
I want the ending.

01:28:58.030 --> 01:29:00.430
But our love was
stronger by far

01:29:00.432 --> 01:29:04.102
than the love of those
who were older than we,

01:29:04.104 --> 01:29:06.006
of the many far wiser than we.

01:29:08.041 --> 01:29:10.411
Neither the angels
in Heaven above,

01:29:11.912 --> 01:29:13.280
or the demons down
under the sea,

01:29:15.081 --> 01:29:17.447
could ever dissever
my soul from the soul

01:29:17.449 --> 01:29:19.854
of the beautiful Annabel Lee.

01:29:22.421 --> 01:29:26.092
And so all the nighttide,
I lie down by the side

01:29:27.627 --> 01:29:29.530
of my darling, my darling,

01:29:30.930 --> 01:29:33.067
my life and my bride,

01:29:36.336 --> 01:29:38.572
in the sepulcher
down by the sea,

01:29:40.539 --> 01:29:43.441
in her tomb by the sounding sea.

01:29:59.559 --> 01:30:01.592
I gave her a way out.

01:30:01.594 --> 01:30:03.130
A chance to be at peace.

01:30:04.463 --> 01:30:06.399
But you haven't found
peace yet, have you?

01:30:16.242 --> 01:30:19.079
The boundaries which
divide life from death

01:30:20.380 --> 01:30:23.016
are at best shadowy and vague.

01:30:24.684 --> 01:30:28.154
Who shall say where the one
ends and the other begins?

01:30:31.091 --> 01:30:32.757
We loved with a love
that was more than love,

01:30:32.759 --> 01:30:34.194
I and my Annabel Lee.

01:30:36.195 --> 01:30:38.428
With a love that the
winged seraphs of Heaven

01:30:38.430 --> 01:30:40.164
coveted her and me.

01:30:40.166 --> 01:30:42.000
And neither the
angels in heaven above

01:30:42.002 --> 01:30:44.038
or the demons down under the sea

01:30:45.438 --> 01:30:49.607
shall never dissever
my soul from the soul

01:30:49.609 --> 01:30:52.346
of the beautiful Annabel Lee.

01:30:55.547 --> 01:30:57.781
You said you know who I am.

01:30:57.783 --> 01:31:00.550
The angel of destruction.

01:31:00.552 --> 01:31:02.989
You know what you need to do.

01:31:25.677 --> 01:31:26.579
Detective.

01:31:27.814 --> 01:31:29.580
What are you doing here?

01:31:29.582 --> 01:31:32.450
I need you and your friends
to answer some more questions.

01:31:32.452 --> 01:31:34.488
Why are there so many
police officers here?

01:31:36.655 --> 01:31:39.025
Wait, what the
hell's going on here?

01:31:41.161 --> 01:31:42.626
Spread out.

01:31:42.628 --> 01:31:43.593
Check everything.

01:31:43.595 --> 01:31:44.795
Stay sharp, boys.

01:31:44.797 --> 01:31:46.129
Detective, what's going on?

01:31:46.131 --> 01:31:47.732
Bring them into
the living room.

01:31:47.734 --> 01:31:49.099
What's this all about?

01:31:49.101 --> 01:31:50.735
Where's Alex Palmer?

01:31:50.737 --> 01:31:52.402
We don't know.

01:31:52.404 --> 01:31:53.474
Search the house.

01:31:55.175 --> 01:31:56.310
Don't know where she is.

01:31:58.811 --> 01:32:00.113
Sit down.

01:32:02.849 --> 01:32:07.552
One of you is responsible
for Jessica's death.

01:32:07.554 --> 01:32:10.854
For all I know, you could've
all conspired to kill her.

01:32:10.856 --> 01:32:12.423
You fuckin' serious?

01:32:12.425 --> 01:32:15.162
Does this look
serious enough for you?

01:32:16.563 --> 01:32:21.368
All of you had motive
to kill Jessica Hayward,

01:32:23.168 --> 01:32:25.405
whether it was
for an inheritance,

01:32:26.372 --> 01:32:28.375
a large debt to pay back,

01:32:29.609 --> 01:32:33.244
a score to settle, or
even out of jealousy.

01:32:33.246 --> 01:32:35.612
I wasn't jealous of Jessica.

01:32:35.614 --> 01:32:37.815
What, so she was
sleeping with my husband.

01:32:37.817 --> 01:32:39.416
So what?

01:32:39.418 --> 01:32:41.352
She could have the
jerk for all I cared.

01:32:41.354 --> 01:32:44.455
Jessica wasn't sleeping
with your husband.

01:32:44.457 --> 01:32:47.561
Jessica Hayward
was a homosexual.

01:32:48.528 --> 01:32:49.893
Jess was gay?

01:32:49.895 --> 01:32:51.230
None of you knew?

01:32:52.332 --> 01:32:55.299
Now according to Jessica's files

01:32:55.301 --> 01:32:57.634
I recovered from her therapist,

01:32:57.636 --> 01:33:03.076
your husband tried to sleep
with Jessica, many times,

01:33:04.176 --> 01:33:07.144
until she finally had
to come clean to him

01:33:07.146 --> 01:33:08.748
about her sexual preference.

01:33:10.817 --> 01:33:17.256
I also read about Jessica's
financial problems with you two.

01:33:18.824 --> 01:33:22.729
You stole $5,000 from your band.

01:33:24.229 --> 01:33:27.330
Jessica tells them,
they kick you out,

01:33:27.332 --> 01:33:31.568
and then she steals
double that from you,

01:33:31.570 --> 01:33:34.475
to deal with her debt to
your friend Maggie over here.

01:33:37.443 --> 01:33:40.745
Did you know any of this was
happening to your own sister

01:33:40.747 --> 01:33:43.813
when you abandoned
her when you were 21?

01:33:43.815 --> 01:33:45.184
I didn't abandon her.

01:33:46.853 --> 01:33:48.652
I was forced to leave.

01:33:48.654 --> 01:33:50.921
Yes, it must've made you angry

01:33:50.923 --> 01:33:54.925
when your parents
blamed you for Jessica

01:33:54.927 --> 01:33:57.727
losing so much of
their money to support

01:33:57.729 --> 01:33:59.964
her gambling addiction.

01:33:59.966 --> 01:34:03.968
She said it was you, and
they believed her over you

01:34:03.970 --> 01:34:07.871
because you were a
struggling alcoholic

01:34:07.873 --> 01:34:10.808
who needed money for her booze.

01:34:10.810 --> 01:34:12.746
Why wouldn't they
believe Jessica over you?

01:34:14.247 --> 01:34:14.914
They kicked you out.

01:34:16.783 --> 01:34:20.454
Sent you to the military to
finally learn some discipline.

01:34:21.787 --> 01:34:25.324
You get discharged,
they disown you entirely,

01:34:26.960 --> 01:34:30.831
and they leave everything
to your lying sister.

01:34:32.398 --> 01:34:36.569
Yes, that must have made
you very angry indeed.

01:34:39.271 --> 01:34:42.639
I might've not loved my
sister as much as I said I did,

01:34:42.641 --> 01:34:43.574
but I didn't kill her.

01:34:43.576 --> 01:34:44.845
I think you did.

01:34:46.813 --> 01:34:47.914
I think all of you did.

01:34:49.916 --> 01:34:54.320
Kind of like how you killed
my son in that church fire.

01:34:59.425 --> 01:35:02.895
All of you attended
the same church

01:35:04.329 --> 01:35:07.831
that burnt down to the ground,

01:35:07.833 --> 01:35:12.572
killing half a dozen people,
including my five-year-old son!

01:35:18.845 --> 01:35:22.815
None of you came forward.

01:35:24.817 --> 01:35:29.523
Jessica even threatened some
of you with your little secret

01:35:30.390 --> 01:35:31.557
to get what she wanted from you.

01:35:33.792 --> 01:35:34.460
Like money.

01:35:36.729 --> 01:35:38.595
Hard to trust a group of people

01:35:38.597 --> 01:35:40.900
who could keep a
secret like that.

01:35:42.402 --> 01:35:44.402
We all had issues
with Jessica, yes, but...

01:35:44.404 --> 01:35:45.635
We didn't kill her!

01:35:45.637 --> 01:35:47.240
Whether you held
the blade or not,

01:35:48.774 --> 01:35:51.375
you're all responsible
for her death.

01:35:51.377 --> 01:35:55.713
Even if you didn't kill her,
you pushed her-

01:35:55.715 --> 01:35:57.751
towards suicide.

01:36:00.752 --> 01:36:05.488
I may not be able
to charge you yet

01:36:05.490 --> 01:36:07.728
for the murder of
Jessica Hayward,

01:36:09.061 --> 01:36:13.863
but you are all under
arrest for the burning

01:36:13.865 --> 01:36:16.099
of Smithsgrove Community Church,

01:36:16.101 --> 01:36:20.340
and will each be charged
with arson and manslaughter.

01:36:21.707 --> 01:36:24.942
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:36:24.944 --> 01:36:28.345
Anything you do say
can be used against you

01:36:28.347 --> 01:36:29.946
in a court of law.

01:36:29.948 --> 01:36:33.750
You have the right
to consult a lawyer,

01:36:33.752 --> 01:36:37.423
and have that lawyer
present during questioning.

01:36:38.524 --> 01:36:40.023
We'll find her.

01:36:40.025 --> 01:36:42.759
She left her cell phone and
other belongings behind.

01:36:42.761 --> 01:36:43.896
She can't have gone far.

01:36:49.935 --> 01:36:51.102
Hey Lancaster, we found her.

01:36:51.104 --> 01:36:52.436
Excellent.

01:36:52.438 --> 01:36:53.504
Where is she?

01:36:53.506 --> 01:36:54.074
Follow me.

01:37:18.663 --> 01:37:20.731
What the hell?

01:37:20.733 --> 01:37:22.969
Found this as well.

01:37:28.673 --> 01:37:30.911
"And now I join
my Annabel Lee."

01:37:31.978 --> 01:37:33.346
What does that even mean?

01:37:34.413 --> 01:37:35.648
Not sure.

01:37:36.748 --> 01:37:37.717
I can only assume.
