Welcome to "Hood Adjacent."

00:33.366 --> 00:35.076
Tonight we're
talking about gangs.

00:35.160 --> 00:39.247
You know, the Bloods,
the Crips, the Asian Boyz,

00:39.330 --> 00:42.041
the Gambinos,
the 4th Avenue Kangaroos,

00:42.125 --> 00:44.544
the Chocolate AK's.

00:44.627 --> 00:46.463
Okay,
I made the last two up, sir.

00:46.546 --> 00:47.881
But watch yourself
on 4th Avenue.

00:47.964 --> 00:48.923
[laughter]

00:49.007 --> 00:51.968
Them kangaroos, man.

00:52.051 --> 00:55.597
They be kanga-banging.

00:55.680 --> 00:58.141
Now, we've all heard
the bad side of gangs.

00:58.224 --> 00:59.267
They're a powerful force.

00:59.350 --> 01:02.145
They're dangerous as [BLEEP].
[woman laughs]

01:02.228 --> 01:03.104
And they can tear
communities apart.

01:03.188 --> 01:04.897
Why you laughed, ma'am,
I don't know.

01:04.980 --> 01:06.900
[laughter]

01:06.983 --> 01:08.109
"They dangerous as [BLEEP]?

01:08.193 --> 01:10.111
"Come to my house, okay?

01:10.195 --> 01:12.489
"When someone turn the channel
when we watching my stories.

01:12.572 --> 01:14.449
"I'm dangerous as [BLEEP].

01:14.532 --> 01:17.410
"Okay, bring one of
them gangs in here

01:17.494 --> 01:20.455
when I'm watching 'Empire.'
Okay?"

01:20.538 --> 01:23.291
South Central is filled with
people from all walks of life.

01:23.374 --> 01:25.126
But what do you think of
when you hear South Central?

01:25.210 --> 01:27.003
Gangbanging.

01:27.086 --> 01:28.797
That's what we're known for.

01:28.880 --> 01:29.964
But South Central
has so much more to offer,

01:30.048 --> 01:33.676
like Kendrick Lamar,
Anthony Anderson,

01:33.760 --> 01:35.553
Venus and Serena Williams,

01:35.637 --> 01:37.430
and myself.

01:37.514 --> 01:39.349
[cheers and applause]

01:39.432 --> 01:41.100
I'm friends with gang members.

01:41.184 --> 01:42.143
And I can tell you,
many of those people aspire

01:42.227 --> 01:44.521
to more than thug life.

01:44.604 --> 01:47.690
It's like being married
to an NBA player.

01:47.774 --> 01:49.818
You made a bad decision.

01:49.901 --> 01:51.152
Maybe you thought
you had no choice

01:51.236 --> 01:53.696
because of your circumstances.

01:53.780 --> 01:54.948
And sometimes,
it's hard to see a way out.

01:55.031 --> 01:57.534
[laughter]

01:57.617 --> 01:59.285
I see you, La La.

01:59.369 --> 02:01.037
[cheers and applause]

02:01.120 --> 02:02.330
- [soft laugh]
That's low.

02:02.413 --> 02:04.165
That's low.

02:04.249 --> 02:05.208
- Gang members are people.

02:05.291 --> 02:06.960
And so are the members
of Trump's cabinet.

02:07.043 --> 02:10.463
No, really, they are.

02:10.547 --> 02:12.131
In fact,
Trump and his cabinet

02:12.215 --> 02:14.551
are a lot like a modern gang.

02:14.634 --> 02:16.386
Think about it.

02:16.469 --> 02:18.346
Most of them had to do
unspeakable things to get in.

02:18.429 --> 02:19.389
And some of them look like

02:19.472 --> 02:21.182
they got the shit
kicked out of them to join.

02:21.266 --> 02:24.102
[scattered cheers and applause]

02:24.185 --> 02:26.604
[cheers and applause]

02:26.688 --> 02:29.149
If the black community
is still expected

02:29.232 --> 02:32.068
to respect the White House
and view cops as heroes,

02:32.151 --> 02:34.070
the rest of America
should be able to see that

02:34.153 --> 02:36.114
not all gang members
are villains.

02:36.197 --> 02:36.990
And that's what the point
of this episode's about.

02:37.073 --> 02:41.369
[cheers and applause]

02:41.452 --> 02:43.037
One are of gang life that
you haven't heard much about

02:43.121 --> 02:45.081
is female gang membership.

02:45.164 --> 02:47.709
Many female gang members

02:47.792 --> 02:49.085
join in an effort
to forge relationships,

02:49.168 --> 02:52.130
and often find
they can't escape that life.

02:52.213 --> 02:53.673
That is something
we tried to change.

02:53.756 --> 02:56.634
This is "The Curious Case...

02:56.718 --> 02:58.177
Of Michelle Nychole."

02:58.261 --> 02:59.596
Oh, what's up?
- All right.

02:59.679 --> 03:01.556

- Who's this?

03:01.639 --> 03:03.057
{\an1}- Oh, this, uh,
Michelle, my n---a,

03:03.141 --> 03:05.059
this my n---a, James--
- Michelle Nychole.

03:05.143 --> 03:07.770
{\an8}<i>- That's Michelle Nychole,</i>
<i>Stevie's ex.</i>

03:07.854 --> 03:10.773
{\an8}<i>And just like the 2Pac movie,</i>
<i>she's gang related.</i>

03:10.857 --> 03:12.442
Michelle Nychole
has the same problem

03:12.525 --> 03:13.318
as many female gang members.

03:13.401 --> 03:15.111
She can't seem to
meet the right guy,

03:15.194 --> 03:17.447
and get up out that life.

03:17.530 --> 03:19.115
{\an1}- The guys that
Michelle attracts

03:19.198 --> 03:20.909
and that she's attracted to

03:20.992 --> 03:22.201
{\an1}bring just more
drama in her life.

03:22.285 --> 03:24.078
D--she's always--
- Like what you did.

03:24.162 --> 03:27.040
- I mean, yeah, but
I--I'm a hood n---a,

03:27.123 --> 03:28.791
so, like, you feel me?

03:28.875 --> 03:30.293
{\an1}Like, I--I ain't exempt
from what I'm saying.

03:30.376 --> 03:31.127
- [laughs]
- You know what I'm saying?

03:31.210 --> 03:33.838
I'm just saying, you should

03:33.922 --> 03:35.673
date a different type of dude--

03:35.757 --> 03:37.800
{\an1}or--and/or girl,
you know how you get down.

03:37.884 --> 03:39.218
- What are some deal breakers?
- Gay.

03:39.302 --> 03:41.971
- Gay, okay.

03:42.055 --> 03:42.263
But aren't you bi?

03:42.347 --> 03:44.599
- Yes.

03:44.682 --> 03:45.808
{\an3}- I get it.

03:45.892 --> 03:46.643
What's the best date you had

03:46.726 --> 03:50.605
with a hard, banged-out?

03:50.688 --> 03:52.148
- The best date I had was...
- Was with me.

03:52.231 --> 03:53.816
{\an1}We was breaking in
cars that night.

03:53.900 --> 03:55.318
{\an3}- How you know
what I was gonna say?

03:55.401 --> 03:56.819
{\an1}- 'Cause I already know.
'Cause it was when...

03:56.903 --> 03:57.612
{\an3}- Is this real?
Is this really real?

03:57.695 --> 04:00.031
- So we breaking in cars, right?

04:00.114 --> 04:01.157
{\an7}I'm like, "Baby, you need some
beat for your whip." She like...

04:01.240 --> 04:03.326
{\an8}- I did, in my Honda.
- "Hell yeah, I need some beat."

04:03.409 --> 04:04.494
{\an7}I see one, boom.
It got beat, right?

04:04.577 --> 04:06.579
{\an7}So I crack it, bam.
Right, I get in there, right?

04:06.663 --> 04:07.538

"Come on, come on, come on."

05:07.306 --> 05:08.725
- You got two kids?

{\an1}- Two children.
I'm not a billy goat.

- We said no dealers,

05:13.730 --> 05:15.064
{\an3}but I guess
we can make an exception.

05:15.148 --> 05:16.733
- If a guy touched my ass,

05:16.816 --> 05:18.401
would you fight him?

{\an3}- What kind of guy
are we talking about here?

{\an1}- What do you mean what kind
of guy, does it matter?

05:21.654 --> 05:22.822
Because if a girl
touched your ass,

05:22.905 --> 05:24.240
then I'd whoop her ass.

05:24.323 --> 05:26.034

- Um, so my nails, uh,

05:33.624 --> 05:35.293
I fell asleep at the manicurist,

05:35.376 --> 05:37.587

{\an3}Oh, wow, those are nice.
Did you...

05:45.595 --> 05:46.429
- You're lying, because
I bite my [BLEEP] nails.

05:46.512 --> 05:48.765
Now you're a liar.
- I'm not lying.

05:48.848 --> 05:49.599
I would never--I wouldn't--

05:49.682 --> 05:51.851
- You just told me
my nails are nice.

05:51.934 --> 05:53.394
{\an7}And I know I have [BLEEP] nubs,
so you're a liar.

05:53.478 --> 05:55.938

05:56.022 --> 05:57.231
I like Roscoe's.

05:57.315 --> 05:58.733
{\an1}Maybe we can, uh,
meet up at Roscoe's.

05:58.816 --> 06:00.026
- Yeah, anytime, you know?

06:00.109 --> 06:01.194
Like, for real, get my number.

06:01.277 --> 06:03.279

06:03.362 --> 06:04.405

{\an7}- Hey, guys, Michelle--
[soft chuckle]

06:44.737 --> 06:46.322
{\an7}Michelle Nychole, uh,
got arrested.

06:46.405 --> 06:49.075

06:49.158 --> 06:50.618
Michelle Nychole got arrested.

06:58.543 --> 06:59.418
<i>so I had to pull up on her.</i>

06:59.502 --> 07:01.879
What happened?

07:01.963 --> 07:03.506
{\an3}- I had a, you know,
a situation here.

07:03.589 --> 07:04.340
I had renters.
- Mm-hmm.

07:04.423 --> 07:06.843
{\an3}- Basically,
they were moving out.

07:06.926 --> 07:08.928
And they thought it was okay

07:09.011 --> 07:12.682
{\an3}to bring, like, six girls
to come and fight me.

07:12.765 --> 07:15.143
So she called her sisters.
Mind you, she's pregnant.

07:15.226 --> 07:16.811
So she called her sisters--

{\an1}- Wait, the girl who
wants to fight you is pregnant?

07:18.312 --> 07:19.522
- Right.
- So she needs backup?

07:19.605 --> 07:21.357
- Right.
- Cause the seed ain't involved.
