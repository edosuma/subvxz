00:31.410 --> 00:33.470
<i>What are you doing?</i>

00:35.310 --> 00:39.220
<i>Get back in the fucking vehicle, Mike!</i>

00:40.220 --> 00:44.120
<i>Mike, get back in the fucking vehicle.</i>

00:47.960 --> 00:51.260
<i>Let's go, Mike, now!</i>

01:00.140 --> 01:01.540
<i>Dad?</i>

01:04.510 --> 01:05.840
<i>Daddy?</i>

01:06.010 --> 01:08.400
I can hardly hear you.

01:08.450 --> 01:12.320
<i>I said your son has gone AWOL.</i>

01:12.750 --> 01:14.710
<i>My son's in Iraq.</i>

01:15.120 --> 01:19.189
<i>Your son was in Iraq, sir.
His unit arrived stateside four days ago.</i>

01:19.190 --> 01:22.229
Soldier, if my son were back,
I'd sure as hell know it.

01:22.230 --> 01:25.999
<i>He has until Sunday to get back
or he'll be listed as absent.</i>

01:26.000 --> 01:29.300
<i>I'm sorry, I have another call.</i>

01:34.670 --> 01:37.270
<i>You have no messages.</i>

02:02.900 --> 02:07.699
<i>Hey, this is Mike. Leave a message.
If I ever get a signal, I'll call you back.</i>

02:07.700 --> 02:15.700
Mike, it's your old man. Heard you're back.
Give me a call when you get a chance.

02:20.250 --> 02:26.019
<i>Think about that. Freedom is on the march,
and we're safer because of it.</i>

02:26.020 --> 02:28.389
<i>Iraq is still dangerous.</i>

02:28.390 --> 02:33.159
<i>It is dangerous because that society
is becoming more free...</i>

02:33.160 --> 02:35.060
<i>...and heading toward democracy.</i>

02:35.070 --> 02:38.069
<i>Analysts say a broader strategy
is at work...</i>

02:38.070 --> 02:42.100
<i>...one that began with the offensive
in the Sunni Triangle city of Samarra...</i>

02:42.110 --> 02:44.440
<i>...earlier this month.</i>

02:46.980 --> 02:48.740
There you go.

02:50.510 --> 02:52.379
You sure that thing's gonna fit?

02:52.380 --> 02:56.470
You gotta trust somebody
sometime, Hank.

03:08.070 --> 03:10.400
- Anyone call?
- Nope.

03:18.980 --> 03:21.109
<i>Fort Rudd, how may I direct your call?</i>

03:21.110 --> 03:25.749
First Sergeant Arnold Bickman,
Criminal Investigations Division.

03:25.750 --> 03:29.549
<i>I'm sorry, sir. I have no one
by that name on base.</i>

03:29.550 --> 03:31.150
Thank you.

03:37.790 --> 03:40.610
Anything you wanna tell me?

03:55.980 --> 03:57.879
Why can't I go with you?

03:57.880 --> 03:59.579
If he's someplace celebrating...

03:59.580 --> 04:02.489
...last thing he needs is his mother
walking in on him.

04:02.490 --> 04:06.519
- I'll call you when I get there tomorrow.
- It's a two-day drive.

04:06.520 --> 04:08.250
For some people.

04:45.960 --> 04:48.029
You don't wanna let it touch the ground.

04:48.030 --> 04:49.560
Okay.

04:51.570 --> 04:54.900
- Where you from?
- El Salvador.

04:55.140 --> 04:58.709
Do you know what it means
when a flag flies upside down?

04:58.710 --> 05:01.879
- No.
- It's an international distress signal.

05:01.880 --> 05:04.149
- No shit?
- No shit.

05:04.150 --> 05:07.049
<i>It means we're in a lot of trouble,
so come save our ass...</i>

05:07.050 --> 05:10.119
...because we don't have a prayer in hell
of saving ourselves.

05:10.120 --> 05:12.659
- It says a lot.
- Yes, it does.

05:12.660 --> 05:14.159
You know how to do it now?

05:14.160 --> 05:16.420
- Oh, yes.
- Good.

05:22.670 --> 05:27.239
<i>This whole concept of "Vote or Die!"
To me the question is:</i>

05:27.240 --> 05:29.169
<i>Are they gonna vote?</i>

05:29.170 --> 05:33.579
<i>Are they gonna leave the bong
long enough to actually vote?</i>

05:33.580 --> 05:35.440
<i>I don't know.</i>

05:43.250 --> 05:44.780
<i>Dad?</i>

05:46.560 --> 05:48.020
<i>Daddy?</i>

05:48.530 --> 05:50.220
Dad?

06:04.610 --> 06:06.630
Dad?

06:12.180 --> 06:14.010
Dad?

06:53.320 --> 06:57.289
<i>A strong low-pressure system will pass
southward across New Mexico tonight...</i>

06:57.290 --> 07:00.999
<i>...bringing with it colder temperatures
and overcast skies.</i>

07:01.000 --> 07:02.990
Go ahead, sergeant.

07:05.770 --> 07:07.660
Thank you, ma'am.

07:13.640 --> 07:15.560
Sergeant Deerfield?

07:18.450 --> 07:20.449
- Hi.
- Thanks. I know you're busy.

07:20.450 --> 07:24.089
I wish you told me you were coming.
I could've made a little more time.

07:24.090 --> 07:26.389
Bet the base has changed a lot
since your day.

07:26.390 --> 07:27.819
- Thanks, corporal.
- Welcome.

07:27.820 --> 07:29.359
What about his buddies?

07:29.360 --> 07:31.500
We asked, of course.

07:31.960 --> 07:34.799
The rest of my guys
just got back from a 72.

07:34.800 --> 07:37.129
I don't wanna seem like
I'm not concerned.

07:37.130 --> 07:40.839
Where they been, it's a miracle
more guys don't blow off for a few days.

07:40.840 --> 07:44.870
Would you mind if I had a look
at his quarters?

07:44.880 --> 07:45.900
No.

07:52.080 --> 07:54.590
- Penning.
- Yes, sarge.

07:54.620 --> 07:57.619
- This is Specialist Deerfield's father.
- Good to meet you.

07:57.620 --> 07:59.219
- Have you heard from Mike?
- No.

07:59.220 --> 08:01.219
He wants to look at his son's quarters.

08:01.220 --> 08:04.159
Certainly, sir. Shortcut's through here.

08:04.160 --> 08:06.399
Me and Mike go back to Bosnia.

08:06.400 --> 08:10.769
He's sure told me
enough stories about you.

08:10.770 --> 08:13.939
- He hasn't called or anything?
- Does that surprise you?

08:13.940 --> 08:17.339
You know better than me, but I recall
Mike showing up for roll call...

08:17.340 --> 08:19.639
...with a collarbone
sticking through his skin.

08:19.640 --> 08:23.009
Long, Ortiez. This is Doc's dad.

08:23.010 --> 08:26.849
- Oh, honored to meet you, sir.
- Good to meet you.

08:26.850 --> 08:27.870
Doc?

08:28.050 --> 08:30.749
A nickname we gave him.
Made no sense.

08:30.750 --> 08:33.058
That's Mike's room there.

08:33.059 --> 08:35.289
You boys have any idea
where Mike could be?

08:35.289 --> 08:36.958
- No, sir.
- Sorry.

08:36.960 --> 08:39.599
- Must be one hell of a woman.
- Yeah.

08:39.600 --> 08:41.299
Good to meet you, sir.

08:41.299 --> 08:48.610
When you hear from Mike, you tell him
to get his butt back here, okay?

08:51.440 --> 08:53.000
Sergeant?

08:53.710 --> 08:56.949
This is Specialist Deerfield's dad.
We've come to look at his bunk.

08:56.950 --> 09:02.589
Roger. I thought you were
someone trying to steal shit.

09:02.590 --> 09:04.219
Is that your room?

09:04.220 --> 09:07.520
Yeah. That's Mike's bunk there.

09:09.990 --> 09:13.120
It was nice to meet you, sir.

09:15.070 --> 09:16.620
Who's that?

09:17.230 --> 09:18.860
We lost a man.

09:34.320 --> 09:35.749
That's your duffel, right?

09:35.750 --> 09:37.190
Yep.

09:37.350 --> 09:45.350
Tried to convince him to take the one
he was issued. It's like talking to a wall.

09:56.010 --> 09:57.539
No photographs.

09:57.540 --> 09:58.910
Sorry?

09:59.080 --> 10:01.909
Mike's always taking pictures
and e-mailing them to me...

10:01.910 --> 10:04.409
...and I don't see any photographs...

10:04.410 --> 10:06.060
<i>...or a camera.</i>

10:06.880 --> 10:10.290
Property theft is a real problem.

10:11.320 --> 10:16.359
- Guess it was the same during your stint.
- Yeah.

10:16.360 --> 10:21.559
You mind if I take this? His mother
gave it to him and I left mine at home.

10:21.560 --> 10:25.730
I'd like to, but I can't
let you remove anything.

10:25.740 --> 10:27.330
I understand.

10:27.740 --> 10:28.860
Okay.

10:32.680 --> 10:36.249
<i>I think New Mexico is a very important
state, and I want to win New Mexico.</i>

10:36.250 --> 10:40.379
<i>I think New Mexico has great
possibilities of better jobs...</i>

10:40.380 --> 10:44.589
<i>...more jobs.
You've got those wonderful...</i>

10:44.590 --> 10:47.319
This phone's been around
some intense heat.

10:47.320 --> 10:51.630
- It's been in Iraq.
- That could do it.

10:52.230 --> 10:53.920
All right.

10:57.270 --> 10:59.760
This is seriously fried.

11:00.200 --> 11:03.760
Let's see. Okay.

11:03.940 --> 11:05.570
Address book.

11:05.740 --> 11:09.309
All right, there's numbers for barracks,
burgers, chicken, Mom...

11:09.310 --> 11:11.610
...pizza, TD's, Ted.

11:11.780 --> 11:13.079
What's TD's?

11:13.080 --> 11:16.689
That's a local joint. Could've been more,
but that's all that's left.

11:16.690 --> 11:21.189
- Okay, thanks. How much?
- You want the media?

11:21.190 --> 11:22.350
Media?

11:22.760 --> 11:24.160
Yeah. Look.

11:29.930 --> 11:31.400
<i>Speed up!</i>

11:32.300 --> 11:34.570
No. This is trash.

11:38.310 --> 11:40.610
Oh, yeah, here we go.

11:45.120 --> 11:46.949
<i>Bonner, take this.</i>

11:46.950 --> 11:49.090
<i>Long, toss the ball!</i>

11:51.220 --> 11:52.650
<i>Historical moment.</i>

11:52.660 --> 11:57.129
<i>The first time one of these kids is gonna
get to touch a real American football.</i>

11:57.130 --> 12:00.690
- That's your son?
- That's Mike.

12:02.270 --> 12:07.170
<i>Yeah! No, you're going this way!
This way!</i>

12:08.000 --> 12:10.509
<i>Hey, that's my ball, you little fuckers!</i>

12:10.510 --> 12:13.370
<i>Hey! Shit.</i>

12:13.740 --> 12:15.070
<i>Fuck.</i>

12:16.110 --> 12:17.809
<i>What's wrong, man?</i>

12:17.810 --> 12:21.749
<i>- Did Ali Baba take your football?
- Turn off the fucking phone.</i>

12:21.750 --> 12:22.810
Any more?

12:22.950 --> 12:26.019
Yeah, but it looks like the rest
of the files are corrupted.

12:26.020 --> 12:29.659
If you want, I have a program at home
that can pull them off.

12:29.660 --> 12:32.829
It's slow, but I could charge you
a hundred flat.

12:32.830 --> 12:36.899
- Can you e-mail them to me?
- Yeah, no problem.

12:36.900 --> 12:39.630
- Thanks.
- Where's TD's?

12:46.610 --> 12:49.150
I'm looking for my boy.

13:34.020 --> 13:36.570
I'm looking for my son.

13:36.760 --> 13:38.230
Good luck.

13:38.390 --> 13:42.130
I need four tequila shots! Four!

14:25.280 --> 14:27.330
<i>What are you doing?</i>

14:27.410 --> 14:30.609
Just looking at some old photos
Mike sent me.

14:30.610 --> 14:32.740
You gonna be okay?

14:35.620 --> 14:40.759
It doesn't make sense.
He wouldn't leave without telling us.

14:40.760 --> 14:42.820
I will find him.

14:44.590 --> 14:46.030
Okay.

14:48.130 --> 14:49.760
Night.

14:49.930 --> 14:51.590
<i>Good night.</i>

15:23.970 --> 15:26.350
<i>I can hardly hear you.</i>

15:26.800 --> 15:29.930
<i>You gotta get me out of here.</i>

15:54.030 --> 15:57.229
Well, she should've known better.

15:57.230 --> 15:59.030
Hold a sec.

16:01.800 --> 16:03.739
- Your son is in the Army.
- Yes, ma'am.

16:03.740 --> 16:05.970
Then you need to see the military police.

16:05.980 --> 16:09.240
They're busy with the war.
I'm trying to check things out.

16:09.250 --> 16:11.879
- You can file a missing person's report.
- Fine.

16:11.880 --> 16:16.219
In which case, you'll need to see
the military police.

16:16.220 --> 16:23.790
How about you let me talk to somebody
that does more than answer a phone?

16:26.530 --> 16:31.429
Sir, I wondered if you could
help me with this...

16:31.430 --> 16:34.569
I don't think you understand.
He loved that dog.

16:34.570 --> 16:37.439
I'm sure he did, ma'am,
but the dog bit him.

16:37.440 --> 16:40.409
- When a dog bites you, what do you do?
- I really don't know.

16:40.410 --> 16:43.449
You tie it up, you give it away,
you might even shoot it.

16:43.450 --> 16:46.749
You don't pick it up by the throat,
wrestle it into the bathroom...

16:46.750 --> 16:49.080
...and drown it in the tub.

16:49.090 --> 16:53.589
That doesn't sound
a little bit strange to you?

16:53.590 --> 16:55.620
Maybe he thought it was more humane.

16:55.630 --> 16:58.429
More humane? It's a Doberman.

16:58.430 --> 17:01.629
He's drowning it right in front of our son
and it's biting him.

17:01.630 --> 17:06.638
And I'm crying for him to stop.
That all sounds humane to you?

17:06.640 --> 17:08.868
Your husband ever threaten you
or your child?

17:08.869 --> 17:10.939
He'd never hurt us. He just needs help.

17:10.940 --> 17:12.909
That's why you need to go to the VA.

17:12.910 --> 17:15.878
You need to go to them
and ask them about counseling.

17:15.880 --> 17:18.249
You think I haven't been down there?

17:18.250 --> 17:21.579
He won't go. He's gonna hurt himself.
I know he is.

17:21.579 --> 17:24.249
- Look, I'd really like to help you here.
- Really?

17:24.250 --> 17:27.419
Oh, because it looks to me
like you don't give a crap.

17:27.420 --> 17:29.189
You know, in fact, I do.

17:29.190 --> 17:32.959
But I gotta tell you, crimes against dogs
are particularly hard to prosecute.

17:32.960 --> 17:35.460
If you don't mind,
I have somebody waiting for me.

17:35.470 --> 17:38.029
- Okay. Fuck you, lady.
- Okay.

17:38.030 --> 17:39.060
Great.

17:46.780 --> 17:49.510
That kind of morning, huh?

17:51.080 --> 17:53.219
You gotta take that to military police.

17:53.220 --> 17:57.989
I'm trying to keep my son
out of more trouble.

17:57.990 --> 17:59.550
I know you're busy...

17:59.560 --> 18:02.859
...but I need you to make one phone call
to his bank and find out...

18:02.860 --> 18:06.229
...if he's made withdrawals or used
his credit card in the last week.

18:06.230 --> 18:08.599
Retired cop, or just watch a lot of TV?

18:08.600 --> 18:10.129
Military police, retired.

18:10.130 --> 18:13.599
Then you should know. Army has
jurisdiction over its own personnel.

18:13.600 --> 18:15.269
Sorry, I hope you find your son.

18:15.270 --> 18:19.139
I don't know what you think your job is,
but if it's anything like mine was...

18:19.140 --> 18:22.879
...it's to roll up drunks, twiddle your
thumbs, not ask too many questions.

18:22.880 --> 18:26.579
But my son has spent the last 18 months
bringing democracy to a shithole...

18:26.580 --> 18:28.219
...and serving his country.

18:28.220 --> 18:31.210
He deserves better than this.

18:39.200 --> 18:46.350
<i>Because we have done the hard work,
we are entering a season of hope.</i>

18:46.770 --> 18:51.609
My God. Hank Deerfield.
I'll be a son of a bitch.

18:51.610 --> 18:54.779
- What the hell you doing at home?
- Well, you almost missed us.

18:54.780 --> 18:57.209
We're taking the camper
to see the grandkids.

18:57.210 --> 19:00.079
- I called you at the base.
- Base?

19:00.080 --> 19:03.949
Well, Christ, Hank.
I've been retired for 14 years.

19:03.950 --> 19:07.289
- You have not.
- Yeah, going on 15.

19:07.290 --> 19:09.420
How in the hell are you?

19:09.430 --> 19:12.129
Fine. Oh, want coffee or a piece of pie?

19:12.130 --> 19:16.399
No, no, I don't have time.
Helen's waiting in the camper.

19:16.400 --> 19:17.899
What'd you do...

19:17.900 --> 19:20.639
...bust an axle and call me for a tow?

19:20.640 --> 19:25.339
No, I was hoping you were still at CID.
I'm looking for a friendly face.

19:25.340 --> 19:29.279
- Neither one of your boys in trouble, I hope.
- No.

19:29.280 --> 19:32.449
- What was that oldest one's name, Darren?
- David.

19:32.450 --> 19:35.880
David, that's right.
Joined 82nd Airborne, didn't he?

19:35.890 --> 19:38.489
- Yeah.
- Yeah, tough bunch of sons of bitches.

19:38.490 --> 19:40.620
How's he liking it?

19:41.420 --> 19:46.129
He died in a helicopter crash
on maneuvers at Fort Bragg 10 years ago.

19:46.130 --> 19:49.999
Oh, God, I'm sorry to hear that, Hank.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.970
Very sorry.

19:52.940 --> 19:54.839
How about the younger one?

19:54.840 --> 19:56.670
- Mike.
- Yeah.

19:56.840 --> 20:00.879
Regular Army, just like his old man.
In Iraq, doing well.

20:00.880 --> 20:05.449
I'm doing a favor for a neighbor lady.
One of her boys is in a little trouble.

20:05.450 --> 20:08.719
Is there anybody we know still there?

20:08.720 --> 20:11.430
No, no. They're all gone.

20:15.560 --> 20:18.229
She got you on a short leash.

20:18.230 --> 20:19.870
Well, you know.

20:20.700 --> 20:23.260
Kids are waiting for us.

21:05.610 --> 21:07.939
I found his old checkbook.

21:07.940 --> 21:12.449
Is there anything written on it?
I need a password.

21:12.450 --> 21:14.819
No, there's nothing on it.

21:14.820 --> 21:15.870
You sure?

21:16.420 --> 21:23.790
Which do you think it is,
I'm blind or I don't feel like telling you?

21:30.270 --> 21:33.030
I'm worried, Hank. I'm truly worried.

21:33.040 --> 21:37.070
He's a good boy. He'll have a reason.

21:38.540 --> 21:39.570
Hank?

21:40.280 --> 21:44.080
I'll find him. Talk to you tomorrow.

22:13.310 --> 22:14.579
What's going on?

22:14.580 --> 22:18.309
Don't you worry, it's not animal-related.

22:18.310 --> 22:19.470
What?

22:19.650 --> 22:22.519
They found body parts
out on Mesa Luna Road.

22:22.520 --> 22:25.490
- I'll get the car.
- Okay.

22:29.830 --> 22:33.230
<i>Hey, Bonner. There's your family.</i>

22:33.930 --> 22:35.529
<i>Stop fucking around.</i>

22:35.530 --> 22:38.969
<i>- You could've fucking broken it!
- You're a fucking idiot.</i>

22:38.970 --> 22:40.090
<i>Oh, fuck.</i>

22:40.270 --> 22:42.139
<i>Oh, shit! What do I do?</i>

22:42.140 --> 22:44.309
<i>Do not stop. Do not fucking stop!</i>

22:44.310 --> 22:47.550
<i>- Speed up! Speed up!
- Bonner!</i>

22:57.690 --> 23:00.760
<i>- Fuck.
- What are you doing?</i>

23:07.800 --> 23:12.030
Maybe go down there a little bit further.

23:13.170 --> 23:16.500
Aaron, I need more evidence markers.

23:16.510 --> 23:18.720
You got all we have.

23:18.840 --> 23:23.649
Straighten out some wire hangers, and buy
Dixie cups to stick on the ends of them.

23:23.650 --> 23:25.440
Come on.

23:26.220 --> 23:28.520
And get me a receipt.

23:39.830 --> 23:41.190
Sean?

23:53.340 --> 23:55.070
Thanks.

24:30.810 --> 24:33.460
Tell me good news, Hodge.

24:35.280 --> 24:39.819
Well, it looks like the victim
was killed by that fire site there...

24:39.820 --> 24:43.629
...then the body was chopped up,
it was burned...

24:43.630 --> 24:46.729
...and animals scattered the parts, so...

24:46.730 --> 24:49.460
And you're smiling
like an idiot because...?

24:49.470 --> 24:53.499
Well, the base bought this field
from the city two months ago.

24:53.500 --> 24:58.409
City property only extends 50 feet
from the center line of the road...

24:58.410 --> 25:02.780
...so I don't think it's our body, chief.

25:03.980 --> 25:06.070
Well, hallelujah.

25:06.250 --> 25:07.880
Let's go home.

25:09.990 --> 25:11.319
Wrap it up, fellas!

25:11.320 --> 25:15.730
Boys with the shiny buttons
are coming in.

25:59.170 --> 26:02.039
<i>It will necessarily break
the back of the insurgency.</i>

26:02.040 --> 26:03.709
<i>It is not, though, the panacea.</i>

26:03.710 --> 26:07.539
<i>Just by taking it out does not mean
the rest of the insurgency will fall.</i>

26:07.540 --> 26:10.549
<i>More than half of Fallujah's
250,000 residents...</i>

26:10.550 --> 26:13.579
<i>...have already fled
in anticipation of the offensive.</i>

26:13.580 --> 26:19.650
<i>Insurgents believed to number in the
thousands have been preparing defenses...</i>

26:19.660 --> 26:24.840
<i>...attacking U.S. Troops,
and rigging booby traps.</i>

26:34.270 --> 26:35.900
Mr. Deerfield?

26:37.070 --> 26:40.870
Jim Osher. Could I get a word?

26:41.040 --> 26:45.330
Yeah, come on in. I'll just be a minute.

27:21.950 --> 27:27.119
Sir, I regret to inform you
that a body was found last night.

27:27.120 --> 27:32.890
Upon investigation, we believe it to be
the remains of your son, Michael Deerfield.

27:32.900 --> 27:36.499
Right. They'll need me
to identify the body?

27:36.500 --> 27:38.380
No, sir. We've...

27:38.400 --> 27:41.999
They've determined identity in other ways.
I believe partial fingerprints.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.669
What do you mean "partial"?
What happened to him?

27:44.670 --> 27:52.160
- I'm not at liberty to say, sir. Someone...
- I wanna see his body now!

28:14.170 --> 28:17.669
Sergeant Deerfield, this isn't necessary.

28:17.670 --> 28:19.770
It's not how you wanna
remember your son.

28:19.780 --> 28:21.270
Maybe not...

28:21.810 --> 28:29.810
...but it's the way he left this earth,
so I don't see as I have any choice.

28:35.120 --> 28:37.659
<i>Working backwards,
carbon patterns show the body...</i>

28:37.660 --> 28:39.729
...was dismembered
before it was burned.

28:39.730 --> 28:43.299
It appears a large knife or tool
was used, but the blade was dull...

28:43.300 --> 28:46.469
...which is why the bones are
shattered rather than severed.

28:46.470 --> 28:49.369
Burn patterns show us
the dismembered parts were stacked...

28:49.370 --> 28:53.009
...and doused with an accelerant in
an attempt to incinerate the body.

28:53.010 --> 28:56.340
You'd need an oven
to approach an effective temperature...

28:56.350 --> 28:59.179
...which means most tissue
would've been left intact.

28:59.180 --> 29:02.719
So the damage is largely the result
of scavengers stripping the bones.

29:02.720 --> 29:05.319
Cause of death will take
more time to determine...

29:05.320 --> 29:07.519
...but there is evidence of stab wounds.

29:07.520 --> 29:08.680
How many?

29:09.360 --> 29:10.660
I'm sorry?

29:10.930 --> 29:14.659
- How many stab wounds?
- Well, with much of the flesh missing...

29:14.660 --> 29:17.869
...we can only count blows
that made impact with bone.

29:17.870 --> 29:20.739
How many of those were there?

29:20.740 --> 29:22.600
Forty-two.

29:25.170 --> 29:27.490
One knife, or several?

29:29.280 --> 29:30.750
One.

29:38.590 --> 29:42.019
- Gonna turn these over to the Army?
- Tried to.

29:42.020 --> 29:49.410
Said they took their own photos.
And they didn't say it in a nice way.

29:52.130 --> 29:55.069
I'd like to give you
a call tomorrow before you go home.

29:55.070 --> 29:56.800
I have a few questions.

29:56.810 --> 29:58.600
Ask them now.

29:58.770 --> 30:02.039
- Your son didn't own a green car?
- Mike doesn't own a car.

30:02.040 --> 30:06.149
Motorist reported seeing a green sedan
parked on the shoulder near the field...

30:06.150 --> 30:07.949
...that Saturday night.

30:07.950 --> 30:12.149
One of the theories is that this is
a carjacking or a robbery gone wrong...

30:12.150 --> 30:15.119
...and there's a big uptick
in gang activity lately.

30:15.120 --> 30:17.759
I wanna see where he died.

30:17.760 --> 30:21.029
I'm sorry. It's an active crime scene,
but I will let you know...

30:21.030 --> 30:24.430
<i>- ...as soon as you can.
- Okay.</i>

30:25.300 --> 30:27.860
What else you wanna ask?

30:29.100 --> 30:31.869
A lot of the deaths like these
have been drug-related.

30:31.870 --> 30:35.339
Are you asking if Mike was
a drug dealer or just an addict?

30:35.340 --> 30:37.040
I don't wanna be asking anything.

30:37.050 --> 30:40.310
You know the Army
does regular drug tests.

30:40.320 --> 30:43.030
Not when they're in Iraq.

30:44.850 --> 30:48.119
Now, we found this
under your son's mattress.

30:48.120 --> 30:50.320
It's not gonna go in my report.

30:50.330 --> 30:52.829
But why I ask is last month...

30:52.830 --> 30:57.099
...we arrested three soldiers who were
trying to smuggle heroin in from Kuwait.

30:57.100 --> 31:00.699
They'd made arrangements to sell it
to a local Mexican gang.

31:00.700 --> 31:02.969
I understand Mike spoke a little Spanish?

31:02.970 --> 31:07.009
And you think he could've been a drug mule
because he spoke Spanish?

31:07.010 --> 31:08.570
No...

31:08.780 --> 31:14.030
...because somebody cut off
his hands and his head.

31:53.760 --> 31:57.140
I'm really sorry about your son.

31:59.330 --> 32:00.990
Show me.

32:03.500 --> 32:05.300
I'm sorry?

32:07.670 --> 32:10.500
I need to see where he died.

32:10.510 --> 32:12.600
It's not our case.

32:13.010 --> 32:15.079
The murder occurred on military property.

32:15.080 --> 32:17.509
- You know where it is?
- There's nothing to see.

32:17.510 --> 32:23.160
Then there shouldn't be any problem
with me seeing it.

32:29.420 --> 32:37.420
You people sure as hell know how to
trample a crime scene, I'll give you that.

32:43.310 --> 32:45.469
I suppose you thought
it was a good idea...

32:45.470 --> 32:51.230
...to have everybody you ever met
park on this shoulder.

32:53.650 --> 32:55.719
If your boys knew
what they were doing...

32:55.720 --> 32:59.549
...they'd have found traces of blood
in the gravel right here.

32:59.550 --> 33:01.659
It's where he was killed.

33:01.660 --> 33:04.329
So you don't see blood,
but you know it's there?

33:04.330 --> 33:05.380
Yeah.

33:05.930 --> 33:10.099
Just like I know his body
was dragged from here...

33:10.100 --> 33:11.620
...to there.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.060
That's remarkable.

33:14.400 --> 33:17.439
The ground is rock-hard,
but you see drag marks.

33:17.440 --> 33:23.109
You go to the trouble to burn a body,
don't you think you'd cover your tracks?

33:23.110 --> 33:25.910
I'm going to the restroom.

33:30.450 --> 33:33.219
You might find it easier
to drive around that field.

33:33.220 --> 33:36.610
You couldn't do any more damage.

33:42.830 --> 33:45.700
Everybody knows everything.

34:00.150 --> 34:01.950
- Hi.
- Hi.

34:02.120 --> 34:04.919
- Can I help you?
- I suppose the MPs have been in here...

34:04.920 --> 34:08.018
...asking questions about
what happened in that field.

34:08.020 --> 34:12.188
- They sure have. Terrible thing.
- I'm checking it out for the family.

34:12.190 --> 34:14.259
Mind if I ask if you saw anything?

34:14.260 --> 34:16.560
I wish we had.
We would've liked to help.

34:16.570 --> 34:19.399
We didn't know what it was
when we smelled it, did we?

34:19.400 --> 34:21.469
- No.
- How's that?

34:21.469 --> 34:24.039
That Sunday,
when we drove in the parking lot...

34:24.040 --> 34:26.870
...we just thought somebody
had been barbecuing.

34:26.880 --> 34:29.840
Smelled like burned meat.

34:32.250 --> 34:33.909
Thank you.

35:23.100 --> 35:26.869
Tell your MP friends they should be
looking for a blue car, not a green one.

35:26.870 --> 35:27.890
Why?

35:28.070 --> 35:31.969
Because a blue car under
a yellow light looks green.

35:31.970 --> 35:33.700
Doesn't it?

35:47.320 --> 35:49.260
It certainly does.

35:58.170 --> 35:59.720
Thank you.

36:00.240 --> 36:03.110
It's the least I could do.

36:03.510 --> 36:06.140
I'd say that's accurate.

36:19.690 --> 36:22.320
<i>I'll get a plane ticket.</i>

36:22.360 --> 36:23.790
No.

36:25.330 --> 36:27.259
What do you mean, "No"?

36:27.260 --> 36:30.199
<i>I'll bring him home soon as I can.</i>

36:30.200 --> 36:34.599
I need to see him.
I need to be with Michael.

36:34.600 --> 36:36.430
<i>He's gone.</i>

36:36.610 --> 36:39.339
I need to be with my boy.

36:39.340 --> 36:41.970
There is nothing left.

36:44.480 --> 36:47.540
What the hell does that mean?

36:48.680 --> 36:52.119
Joanie, for once in your life,
will you take my word for something?

36:52.120 --> 36:54.750
For once? For once?

36:54.920 --> 36:57.559
I seem to remember
me being the one saying no...

36:57.560 --> 37:01.399
...and you saying it'd be good for his
character. Who won that argument, Hank?

37:01.400 --> 37:05.069
Mike was the one who wanted to join.
I sure as hell didn't encourage it.

37:05.070 --> 37:11.509
Living in this house, he never could've
felt like a man if he hadn't gone.

37:11.510 --> 37:16.640
Both of my boys, Hank.
You could've left me one.

37:27.590 --> 37:29.110
<i>Joanie?</i>

37:33.060 --> 37:35.360
Joan, please.

37:44.940 --> 37:49.990
Joanie, I can't sit here
and listen to you cry.

37:52.350 --> 37:54.370
Well, then don't.

38:50.810 --> 38:52.570
Door.

38:55.740 --> 38:57.340
Night.

38:58.450 --> 39:00.280
Night, sweetheart.

39:30.510 --> 39:31.810
<i>Fuck!</i>

39:38.150 --> 39:41.859
<i>Another hallway left. Stacked, on me.
Ortiez, cover this door to the right.</i>

39:41.860 --> 39:44.459
<i>To the right.
Penning, get this door with me. Long!</i>

39:44.460 --> 39:46.129
<i>- Roger!
- Covering!</i>

39:46.130 --> 39:47.690
<i>Got it.</i>

39:47.960 --> 39:49.190
<i>Go, go.</i>

39:49.400 --> 39:51.900
<i>- Clear. Clear.
- Clear.</i>

39:52.730 --> 39:56.669
<i>Give me a status on that door!
Better not fuck around with that phone!</i>

39:56.670 --> 39:59.000
<i>Absolutely not, Bonner!</i>

39:59.640 --> 40:03.120
<i>See how the clothes aren't burnt?</i>

40:05.380 --> 40:07.850
<i>It's really weird, Dad.</i>

40:08.550 --> 40:14.530
<i>- All right, all clear. Let's move it out!
- Move it out.</i>

40:32.840 --> 40:33.870
Sure.

40:34.040 --> 40:36.370
Evie, chicken sandwich.

41:03.810 --> 41:06.050
Mustard or mayonnaise?

41:07.040 --> 41:09.079
No, thank you, ma'am.

41:09.080 --> 41:12.149
A woman stands topless
in front of you...

41:12.150 --> 41:16.210
..."ma'am" could be taken as an insult.

41:16.580 --> 41:18.549
- This your son?
- Yes, ma'am.

41:18.550 --> 41:22.659
I'm asking if anybody saw him.
It would've been a week ago Saturday.

41:22.660 --> 41:28.310
I'm sorry. I don't recognize
anything but the uniform.

41:28.900 --> 41:31.370
Thank you, ma'am. Miss.

41:39.670 --> 41:41.160
Right here.

42:00.460 --> 42:02.220
Stay here.

42:02.860 --> 42:04.929
Excuse me, lieutenant?

42:04.930 --> 42:08.099
I was just wondering how
I came to be assigned this case.

42:08.100 --> 42:09.330
Which case?

42:09.470 --> 42:11.209
Jacob Ronald Millard...

42:11.210 --> 42:14.709
...slaughterhouse employee,
arrested for torturing chickens.

42:14.710 --> 42:16.979
It's no big deal. Everybody does it.

42:16.980 --> 42:19.279
Everybody doesn't poke
their eyes out, asshole.

42:19.280 --> 42:21.249
- Sure, they do.
- Shut up!

42:21.250 --> 42:24.549
Boss doesn't want me
humping his daughter.

42:24.550 --> 42:26.919
Now we're shocked beyond words.

42:26.920 --> 42:29.819
You see how you could draw
information out of people?

42:29.820 --> 42:32.389
People just like you, Emily.

42:32.390 --> 42:37.160
That is how you got promoted from
traffic to detective squad, am I right?

42:37.170 --> 42:38.430
I'm sorry?

42:38.600 --> 42:40.800
Oh, don't be.

42:40.970 --> 42:44.909
If Wayne or Hodge could've fucked their
way into the squad, they would've too.

42:44.910 --> 42:46.409
Well, Wayne would have.

42:46.410 --> 42:50.209
One of us needs to know
what we're doing.

42:50.210 --> 42:53.979
You see, that's what concerns me.
Having fucked my way into the job...

42:53.980 --> 42:58.749
...I may not be qualified enough to piece
together this complex of a crime.

42:58.750 --> 43:00.419
I mean, take that murder site.

43:00.420 --> 43:04.459
I would've never concluded that
that soldier was killed on Army property.

43:04.460 --> 43:08.099
I would've been fooled by the signs
of struggle on the side of the road.

43:08.100 --> 43:12.199
And you know that little trail of broken
brush from there to where he was burned?

43:12.200 --> 43:17.300
Well, that would've made me think he was
killed in our jurisdiction, and then moved.

43:17.310 --> 43:21.339
Because the killers didn't think it smart
to chop him up under a bright streetlight.

43:21.340 --> 43:26.510
Yeah. I would've totally
misread that crime scene.

43:31.720 --> 43:34.419
No, no, no. It's good work.

43:34.420 --> 43:36.859
I mean, we needed another homicide.

43:36.860 --> 43:40.390
What, we've solved three
out of the last 10?

43:40.400 --> 43:43.229
Another unsolved would cement
my standing with the mayor.

43:43.230 --> 43:45.599
You have a problem with
your fellow detectives?

43:45.600 --> 43:48.169
- You feel the need to show them up?
- No, sir.

43:48.170 --> 43:50.400
So it's the military police?

43:50.410 --> 43:53.369
You think they're boobs,
they'll bungle the investigation?

43:53.370 --> 43:57.679
No, but let's not pretend we don't know the
real motives for the Army wanting this case.

43:57.680 --> 44:01.979
Psychic powers.
When did you discover you had these?

44:01.980 --> 44:06.249
You don't believe their primary concern will
be how this incident reflects on the Army?

44:06.250 --> 44:08.259
This is a career move? Is that it?

44:08.260 --> 44:10.789
I don't have a career, sir. I have a job.

44:10.790 --> 44:12.989
I take care of my son
and do what I'm told.

44:12.990 --> 44:15.659
This boy died in a ditch
beside one of our streets.

44:15.660 --> 44:19.999
Someone burned him like a cord of wood,
leaving his remains for animals to chew on.

44:20.000 --> 44:22.799
With respect, if that was your son
just back from Iraq...

44:22.800 --> 44:26.009
...I don't think you'd be as happy
about tossing this case off...

44:26.010 --> 44:28.879
...so you look better come election time.

44:28.880 --> 44:32.209
- That was with respect?
- That was my intent, sir.

44:32.210 --> 44:34.779
Fine. I'll think about it
and I'll let you know.

44:34.780 --> 44:36.719
Every second we lose in this...

44:36.720 --> 44:39.649
Didn't you say that you would do
whatever you were told?

44:39.650 --> 44:43.070
I sometimes exaggerate for effect.

44:46.890 --> 44:48.280
How's David?

44:49.030 --> 44:50.190
Sorry?

44:50.370 --> 44:52.060
Your son.

44:53.940 --> 44:55.599
He's fine, thanks for asking.

44:55.600 --> 44:59.309
That deadbeat ex of yours ever
show up for any of his games?

44:59.310 --> 45:01.909
David's pretty pathetic
at every sport he attempts...

45:01.910 --> 45:04.679
...so he wants as few people
to witness it as possible.

45:04.680 --> 45:07.379
Well, that's a damn shame, isn't it?

45:07.380 --> 45:11.330
It's not like he's the boy's father.

45:13.990 --> 45:16.119
Anyway, way I see it...

45:16.120 --> 45:20.459
...it's the oddballs and the misfits who go
on to do interesting things with their lives.

45:20.460 --> 45:22.799
How many former
high school quarterbacks...

45:22.800 --> 45:26.069
...do we roll into the drunk tank
every Saturday night?

45:26.070 --> 45:28.669
Little misery in school is a good thing.

45:28.670 --> 45:33.109
You know, I was first-string quarterback
in my high school.

45:33.110 --> 45:38.760
I seem to recall you
showing me pictures of such, sir.

45:43.320 --> 45:46.549
You're gonna keep after me
about this Deerfield boy, aren't you?

45:46.550 --> 45:52.100
I think you know what
the right thing to do is, sir.

45:52.860 --> 45:55.350
Jesus H. Christ.

45:57.270 --> 45:58.729
<i>- Hilary.
- Yes, sir?</i>

45:58.730 --> 46:03.980
<i>- Get me Captain Fenderman at the base.
- Yes, sir.</i>

46:45.080 --> 46:48.710
Would you like to sit down, ma'am?

46:50.990 --> 46:52.970
Is that everything?

46:54.720 --> 46:56.819
Is that all of him?

46:56.820 --> 46:58.520
Yes, ma'am.

47:00.330 --> 47:03.829
- You must have to keep that room cold.
- Yes, ma'am.

47:03.830 --> 47:05.860
That looks cold.

47:10.340 --> 47:14.060
I wanna go inside. Can I go inside?

47:17.380 --> 47:19.750
No, ma'am. I'm sorry.

47:31.330 --> 47:34.310
My deepest sympathies, ma'am.

47:37.270 --> 47:40.640
You don't have a child, do you?

47:41.940 --> 47:43.490
Do you?

49:13.790 --> 49:15.959
- Mr. Deerfield?
- Hi.

49:15.960 --> 49:18.529
I heard you ask if you
could have Mike's Bible...

49:18.530 --> 49:21.030
...and I thought it might
bring you some comfort.

49:21.040 --> 49:22.699
Anybody know you took this?

49:22.700 --> 49:27.970
No, sir. I asked the visitors' center
where you were staying and they told me.

49:27.980 --> 49:29.709
Can I buy you a coffee?

49:29.710 --> 49:32.360
I really should get back.

49:33.680 --> 49:35.650
How about a drink?

50:16.060 --> 50:17.790
To Mike.

50:25.870 --> 50:31.170
I need to ask you something.
And I want the truth.

50:32.910 --> 50:34.770
Was Mike doing drugs?

50:34.780 --> 50:37.870
Doc? I guess.

50:38.580 --> 50:43.719
No more than the other guys.
He wasn't like a heavy doper or anything.

50:43.720 --> 50:47.650
You ever see him hanging out
off the base with anyone?

50:47.660 --> 50:49.380
Maybe Mexicans?

50:49.560 --> 50:51.250
No, sir.

50:54.300 --> 50:56.200
How you adjusting?

50:56.400 --> 50:58.230
Being back?

50:59.470 --> 51:01.769
Hasn't been that long.

51:01.770 --> 51:03.669
Call your parents?

51:03.670 --> 51:07.370
My mom. My dad and I aren't close.

51:09.780 --> 51:13.270
- Did you guys talk much?
- Sure.

51:14.650 --> 51:17.210
We could've talked more.

51:21.290 --> 51:23.989
Did he ever say anything to you
that I should know?

51:23.990 --> 51:25.750
No, sir.

51:26.190 --> 51:28.020
I mean...

51:28.360 --> 51:31.129
...you see shit over there
you don't wanna talk about...

51:31.130 --> 51:33.199
- ...even with your buddies.
- Yeah.

51:33.200 --> 51:35.169
But he did all right, Mike?

51:35.170 --> 51:38.230
He was a first-class soldier.

51:38.340 --> 51:41.339
You know Mike. He loved the Army.

51:41.340 --> 51:48.570
Couldn't wait to get there, save
the good guys and hurt the bad guys.

51:51.520 --> 51:55.959
They shouldn't send heroes
to places like Iraq.

51:55.960 --> 51:58.950
Everything there's fucked up.

51:59.460 --> 52:05.430
Before I went, I'd never say this,
but you ask me now...

52:06.130 --> 52:12.700
...they should just nuke it
and watch it all turn back to dust.

52:15.680 --> 52:16.800
<i>Hank?</i>

52:18.080 --> 52:19.740
You okay?

52:19.910 --> 52:23.249
<i>Yeah, I was just about to call you.</i>

52:23.250 --> 52:26.150
A package came from Michael.

52:29.060 --> 52:31.020
What kind of package?

52:31.030 --> 52:35.699
I don't know, it's a package.
He sent it to himself. It's from overseas.

52:35.700 --> 52:37.129
I'm gonna open it.

52:37.130 --> 52:38.260
No.

52:38.430 --> 52:40.910
What do you mean, "No"?

52:41.370 --> 52:45.669
Does it look like it's been opened
by customs or by the military?

52:45.670 --> 52:49.270
How would I know? No, it doesn't.

52:49.440 --> 52:50.779
<i>Why can't I open it?</i>

52:50.780 --> 52:52.250
Just don't.

52:52.410 --> 52:53.740
Please.

52:55.380 --> 52:58.200
<i>Just put it someplace safe.</i>

53:00.420 --> 53:02.120
Okay.

53:03.690 --> 53:06.020
<i>- Night.
- Good night.</i>

54:03.620 --> 54:05.790
- Morning.
- Morning.

54:06.090 --> 54:08.989
I wonder if I could ask you
a few questions about your son.

54:08.990 --> 54:11.989
- I thought it wasn't your case.
- It sort of fell back to me.

54:11.990 --> 54:14.970
Isn't that our good fortune?

54:15.000 --> 54:17.760
I was wondering if you knew
if your son had any enemies.

54:17.770 --> 54:21.469
You mean other than the thousands
of Iraqis and foreign fighters...

54:21.470 --> 54:23.899
...trying to kill him
till a couple of weeks ago?

54:23.900 --> 54:27.939
Yeah, that shirt looks like it's still wet.

54:27.940 --> 54:29.740
It's dry enough.

54:29.980 --> 54:32.609
Anything bothering him
that you know about?

54:32.610 --> 54:34.010
No.

54:34.180 --> 54:36.719
You looking into the gang connection?

54:36.720 --> 54:40.649
Why? You have reason to think your son
was involved in gangs or drugs?

54:40.650 --> 54:42.120
No.

54:43.220 --> 54:45.859
- When did you last speak to him?
- Why?

54:45.860 --> 54:49.699
Capital One faxed me a recent summary
of his credit-card charges.

54:49.700 --> 54:51.799
After he got back,
he bought tube socks...

54:51.800 --> 54:54.530
I told him a dozen times,
those are the worst socks.

54:54.540 --> 54:57.869
They have no heel,
they wear right through.

54:57.870 --> 55:01.170
And then he went out for some chicken.

55:01.180 --> 55:03.009
Does it say what time?

55:03.010 --> 55:05.150
And no more charges.

55:05.850 --> 55:10.219
We assume your son was killed sometime
Saturday night or Sunday morning.

55:10.220 --> 55:12.819
We haven't found his wallet,
but if it was stolen...

55:12.820 --> 55:17.659
...we'd see a lot more charges on it,
like computers, stereos, what have you.

55:17.660 --> 55:21.720
Have you been to the chicken place yet?

55:36.810 --> 55:40.040
- Enjoy.
- How can I help you?

55:40.180 --> 55:42.949
We're inquiring about a soldier
who was here a week ago.

55:42.950 --> 55:45.719
You're kidding me, right?
We're a block from the base.

55:45.720 --> 55:47.789
Can you tell what time he was here?

55:47.790 --> 55:50.259
It's the last four digits.

55:50.260 --> 55:55.259
1:03 a.m. Sunday morning.
We bill that as Saturday. Anything else?

55:55.260 --> 55:59.099
- Can you tell us what he bought?
- Not without the actual receipt.

55:59.100 --> 56:01.070
Okay. Thank you.

56:01.240 --> 56:05.139
Your four-piece dinner is $6.79.
Is that what most people order?

56:05.140 --> 56:06.739
That or the three-piece.

56:06.740 --> 56:08.610
So with tax...

56:08.880 --> 56:11.610
...$21.77 would be...

56:12.780 --> 56:14.879
...three meals, three people.

56:14.880 --> 56:21.120
Four, if it's the three-piece,
or one really hungry soldier.

56:47.920 --> 56:50.819
There you are.
I just dropped something off for you.

56:50.820 --> 56:53.589
- You did?
- We took statements from Mike's squad.

56:53.590 --> 56:55.050
Thought you'd want them.

56:55.060 --> 56:58.020
That's great. I was gonna call you
to arrange interviews.

56:58.030 --> 57:00.340
Saved you the trouble.

57:00.630 --> 57:02.360
How so?

57:02.530 --> 57:05.299
Sworn statements on your desk.

57:05.300 --> 57:08.969
What, you didn't think
I'd want to interview them myself?

57:08.970 --> 57:11.639
Just trying to give you a leg up.

57:11.640 --> 57:14.409
Thanks. I sort of like to do
my own detective work.

57:14.410 --> 57:16.479
I'll tell you what.

57:16.480 --> 57:17.940
Read the statements.

57:17.950 --> 57:22.819
If you still wanna question them, I will
be glad to take the request to my C.O.

57:22.820 --> 57:24.580
Perhaps you misunderstood me.

57:24.590 --> 57:27.719
It's not a request.
I want the list of the men in his unit.

57:27.720 --> 57:30.619
- On your desk.
- And I wanna interview them this afternoon.

57:30.620 --> 57:32.829
You'll have to go to my C.O.
With that one.

57:32.830 --> 57:36.829
- My chief already spoke to him.
- This one's a bit of a jurisdictional mess.

57:36.830 --> 57:40.529
There is no mess. The murder was
committed in our jurisdiction.

57:40.530 --> 57:43.839
That's where it gets murky. Read those.

57:43.840 --> 57:47.540
I'd be glad to put the request in.

57:52.680 --> 57:56.149
- You don't have the sworn statements?
- I have the statements...

57:56.150 --> 57:58.619
Then they're cooperating.
I don't see the problem.

57:58.620 --> 58:00.989
I have a right to interview
potential witnesses.

58:00.990 --> 58:04.759
- Has the Army said you can't?
- They said they'd consider my request.

58:04.760 --> 58:06.329
And that was 10 minutes ago.

58:06.330 --> 58:09.699
And I'd like to talk to these men
before they've been coached...

58:09.700 --> 58:13.699
...or debriefed so any inconsistencies
in their stories will have disappeared.

58:13.700 --> 58:16.569
Being a former military man,
I'm sure you've seen that...

58:16.570 --> 58:21.839
...perhaps when you served
with Lieutenant Kirklander?

58:21.840 --> 58:23.970
I'll tell you what.

58:24.110 --> 58:27.879
Skip upstairs and cry to your boyfriend.

58:27.880 --> 58:33.090
Because I'm just not in the mood
to give a shit.

59:14.030 --> 59:18.599
<i>We're showing video that has
just come in to CNN from Fallujah.</i>

59:18.600 --> 59:20.330
You ordered yet?

59:27.940 --> 59:29.910
Okay. Dig in, men.

59:48.530 --> 59:50.760
- May I?
- Please.

59:53.400 --> 59:56.639
- Okay. Out.
- No, I can do it.

59:56.640 --> 01:00:01.370
You can. Now get ready for bed. Go on.

01:00:07.850 --> 01:00:10.740
Is there anything I can do?

01:00:38.580 --> 01:00:40.479
You're supposed to read it to me.

01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:42.949
I don't understand one word of it.

01:00:42.950 --> 01:00:45.319
Well, do you know any stories?

01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:47.649
I'm not much of a storyteller.

01:00:47.650 --> 01:00:50.630
Well, then read me the book.

01:00:56.460 --> 01:00:58.660
You know where your name comes from?

01:00:58.670 --> 01:01:01.910
- My mother?
- No, before that.

01:01:02.140 --> 01:01:05.709
You're named after King David.
Your mother didn't tell you that?

01:01:05.710 --> 01:01:07.110
That figures.

01:01:12.350 --> 01:01:13.870
All right.

01:01:14.310 --> 01:01:18.880
There were two great armies assembled,
the Israelites and the Philistines.

01:01:18.890 --> 01:01:21.850
They were both up on hills,
the Valley of Elah in between.

01:01:21.860 --> 01:01:24.219
It's in Palestine, you know where it is?

01:01:24.220 --> 01:01:25.589
- No.
- Doesn't matter.

01:01:25.590 --> 01:01:29.299
Anyway, the Philistines had a champion.

01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:32.060
A huge giant...

01:01:32.230 --> 01:01:33.980
...named Goliath.

01:01:34.030 --> 01:01:36.439
Really? There's a robot named Goliath.

01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:38.200
This is a different guy.

01:01:38.210 --> 01:01:41.660
So every day, for 40 days...

01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:44.709
...Goliath would stride down
into the valley...

01:01:44.710 --> 01:01:48.249
...and challenge somebody from the
other side to fight, but nobody would.

01:01:48.250 --> 01:01:52.389
All the bravest and strongest warriors
that the king had were all too scared.

01:01:52.390 --> 01:01:55.919
- Why didn't they just shoot him?
- They didn't have guns.

01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:58.220
They had arrows,
but there are rules to combat.

01:01:58.230 --> 01:02:02.699
You don't shoot somebody that's
challenging you to fight with a sword.

01:02:02.700 --> 01:02:04.220
So anyway...

01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:10.239
...one day this kid, not much bigger
than you, comes delivering bread.

01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:12.539
He says to the king, "I'll fight Goliath."

01:02:12.540 --> 01:02:14.870
- Really? No way.
- True story.

01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:18.409
So the king dresses David
in his own armor.

01:02:18.410 --> 01:02:22.449
But it's much too big and heavy, so David
takes it off and he looks around...

01:02:22.450 --> 01:02:25.849
...and he finds five smooth stones
about that big.

01:02:25.850 --> 01:02:31.389
And he steps out into the valley,
with his slingshot in his hand.

01:02:31.390 --> 01:02:33.389
Goliath comes running...

01:02:33.390 --> 01:02:35.799
...yelling this horrible scream.

01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:38.460
And David lets fly with that slingshot.

01:02:38.470 --> 01:02:40.999
Hits him in the forehead,
cracks his skull open...

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.799
...Goliath falls down, dead.

01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:45.439
So he shot him.

01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:48.830
With a rock. Not the same thing.

01:02:51.950 --> 01:02:54.949
- And you want to know how he beat him?
- How?

01:02:54.950 --> 01:02:59.419
The first thing David had to fight
was his own fear.

01:02:59.420 --> 01:03:02.570
He beat that, he beat Goliath.

01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:07.559
Because when Goliath came running, David
planted his feet, took aim and waited.

01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:10.759
You know how much courage that took?

01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:16.500
Just a few more steps
and Goliath would've crushed him.

01:03:16.570 --> 01:03:19.870
Then he let fly with that rock.

01:03:20.670 --> 01:03:23.609
That's how you fight monsters.

01:03:23.610 --> 01:03:27.409
You lure them in close to you,
you look them in the eye...

01:03:27.410 --> 01:03:29.820
...you smack them down.

01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:33.089
You fight a lot of monsters?

01:03:33.090 --> 01:03:34.310
Yeah.

01:03:34.620 --> 01:03:36.250
You win?

01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:39.020
If I didn't, I'd have been crushed, right?

01:03:39.030 --> 01:03:40.550
Yeah.

01:03:41.190 --> 01:03:43.030
Okay, then.

01:03:44.130 --> 01:03:45.390
Good night.

01:03:59.350 --> 01:04:01.610
He likes to sleep with that door open.

01:04:01.620 --> 01:04:03.240
He'll be okay.

01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:15.360
Door!

01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:25.300
- Not that much.
- Okay.

01:04:27.300 --> 01:04:28.690
That's good.

01:04:45.090 --> 01:04:47.159
You know that story isn't true.

01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:49.370
Of course it's true.

01:04:50.030 --> 01:04:52.570
It's even in the Koran.

01:04:55.330 --> 01:04:59.939
- May I read the men's statements?
- There is nothing in them that'll help.

01:04:59.940 --> 01:05:07.940
The last time any of the men saw Mike was
Saturday afternoon, before he left base.

01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:18.220
You're a good father.

01:05:19.290 --> 01:05:22.959
You don't have to prove you loved him.

01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:25.120
I'm sure he knew.

01:05:44.580 --> 01:05:46.140
<i>Dad?</i>

01:05:50.450 --> 01:05:52.150
<i>Daddy?</i>

01:05:56.690 --> 01:05:59.110
<i>Something happened, Dad.</i>

01:06:24.420 --> 01:06:26.889
<i>It's the second day
of what the U.S. Military...</i>

01:06:26.890 --> 01:06:31.640
<i>...is now calling
the "New Dawn" in Fallujah.</i>

01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:41.099
<i>The operation is aimed at crushing
the insurgents in their strongholds.</i>

01:06:41.100 --> 01:06:43.939
<i>But how many insurgents are still there?</i>

01:06:43.940 --> 01:06:46.479
<i>We'll go live to the front lines
in a moment.</i>

01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:48.100
Hi.

01:06:49.550 --> 01:06:51.640
Evie, from the bar.

01:06:54.350 --> 01:06:55.650
"Ma'am"?

01:07:00.790 --> 01:07:02.280
Yeah.

01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:04.190
I'm sorry.

01:07:04.530 --> 01:07:05.890
Hello.

01:07:06.060 --> 01:07:08.199
I saw the picture of your son
in the paper.

01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:11.369
When you came in,
I thought he was just missing.

01:07:11.370 --> 01:07:12.580
I'm sorry.

01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:14.660
Thank you.

01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:17.860
May I?

01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:26.560
Nice eyes.

01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:40.000
Him I remember.

01:07:41.100 --> 01:07:44.799
I work in another bar on the weekends.
He was there.

01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:47.700
Must've been Saturday night.

01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:51.550
What's the name of that bar?

01:07:57.250 --> 01:07:59.579
- Yeah, they were here.
- Both of them?

01:07:59.580 --> 01:08:02.349
- Yeah, them and their buddies.
- Saturday night?

01:08:02.350 --> 01:08:06.559
We had to throw them out. That one was
harassing one of the dancers, real asshole.

01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:08.759
- This guy?
- Other one.

01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:12.559
Get a lot of assholes in here,
but he was going for the prize.

01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:15.699
- Shouting obscenities at the dancers.
- You got the wrong man.

01:08:15.700 --> 01:08:19.099
You ask me to ID a guy,
and then you tell me that I'm wrong.

01:08:19.100 --> 01:08:20.830
You two related?

01:08:21.140 --> 01:08:22.538
What time they leave?

01:08:22.540 --> 01:08:24.069
Fuck if I know.

01:08:24.069 --> 01:08:28.209
They weren't happy about it. Two of them
got into it out in the parking lot.

01:08:28.210 --> 01:08:31.578
Thought I was gonna have to
break it up myself.

01:08:31.580 --> 01:08:33.170
Thank you.

01:08:44.330 --> 01:08:47.429
Detective Nugent will stay
while you write out your statement.

01:08:47.430 --> 01:08:49.299
I want the pen back, Nugent.

01:08:49.300 --> 01:08:50.819
Word?

01:08:58.810 --> 01:09:02.779
This is not Saigon. This is not 1967.
You do not question witnesses.

01:09:02.779 --> 01:09:04.749
I figured somebody should.

01:09:04.750 --> 01:09:07.749
It must be frustrating being
such a damn good investigator...

01:09:07.750 --> 01:09:12.089
...surrounded by incompetent fools.
Remind me, what is it you do in Munro?

01:09:12.090 --> 01:09:13.920
I haul gravel.

01:09:14.090 --> 01:09:15.259
That's a shame.

01:09:15.260 --> 01:09:19.698
Think of all the crime that could've
been solved if you'd been on the job.

01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:22.929
This goes to trial, the defense
will say you poisoned the well.

01:09:22.930 --> 01:09:25.299
- It won't go to trial.
- What?

01:09:25.300 --> 01:09:26.939
- It wasn't them.
- I'm sorry?

01:09:26.939 --> 01:09:31.169
I don't know why they lied about not
being with him, but they didn't do it.

01:09:31.170 --> 01:09:34.109
- They were fighting in the parking lot.
- Blowing off steam.

01:09:34.109 --> 01:09:36.849
You have not been to war
so you won't understand this.

01:09:36.850 --> 01:09:41.379
You do not fight beside a man
and then do that to him.

01:09:41.380 --> 01:09:45.100
That's quite the world you live in.

01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:47.590
Find out why they lied.

01:09:51.790 --> 01:09:54.100
There'll be a reason.

01:10:04.810 --> 01:10:06.780
So you were there.

01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:09.040
Yeah.

01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:11.649
So why would you lie?

01:10:11.650 --> 01:10:13.710
It's complicated.

01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:18.910
Why don't you just tell me
what happened?

01:10:22.020 --> 01:10:24.159
We were at this strip club.

01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:29.199
Just hanging out, having a good time.
We were drinking, of course.

01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:32.399
And Mike starts acting really weird.

01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:34.799
Really angry,
throwing change at the stripper.

01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:36.569
Then he started talking trash...

01:10:36.570 --> 01:10:40.379
...so she started talking trash,
and they tossed us out.

01:10:40.380 --> 01:10:42.109
And we're getting in the car...

01:10:42.110 --> 01:10:44.879
...and Bonner's all pissed
saying Mike can walk.

01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:47.919
So Mike grabs him and they just
start going off on each other.

01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:51.019
But it's the kind of shit
that happens all the time.

01:10:51.020 --> 01:10:53.559
The whole macho-warrior crap.

01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:55.219
Nobody got hurt.

01:10:55.220 --> 01:10:57.929
So we got in the car,
we drove around for a while.

01:10:57.930 --> 01:11:01.229
And then we stopped at the Chicken Shack,
across from the base.

01:11:01.230 --> 01:11:04.129
Mike bought, for getting us kicked out.

01:11:04.130 --> 01:11:08.139
- And what time was this?
- I don't know.

01:11:08.140 --> 01:11:09.400
Around 1.

01:11:09.940 --> 01:11:12.830
And then we came back here.

01:11:15.650 --> 01:11:17.240
All of you?

01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:19.910
No.

01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:22.380
Just the three of us.

01:11:24.490 --> 01:11:26.450
Why would you leave him there?

01:11:26.460 --> 01:11:28.589
Because we were wasted.

01:11:28.590 --> 01:11:32.459
We had had enough,
but Mike wanted to find some meth.

01:11:32.460 --> 01:11:33.799
He wanted to buy drugs?

01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:36.499
Yeah, like he needed
to be more fucked up.

01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:39.230
Pardon my language, ma'am.

01:11:39.370 --> 01:11:41.099
You think that's what happened?

01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:44.109
He went looking for drugs,
ran into the wrong people?

01:11:44.110 --> 01:11:46.639
Who knows?
I mean, Mike always had secrets.

01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:50.909
You know, over there,
he was always sneaking off by himself.

01:11:50.910 --> 01:11:55.749
He really didn't get along
too well with people.

01:11:55.750 --> 01:12:00.119
So you get kicked out of the strip club
at 11, show up at the Chicken Shack at 1.

01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:02.589
What were you doing
for a whole two hours?

01:12:02.590 --> 01:12:06.659
Driving around,
looking for a party, or women.

01:12:06.660 --> 01:12:08.980
Did you stop anywhere?

01:12:10.470 --> 01:12:12.090
Yes, ma'am.

01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:17.150
Now you want me to guess?

01:12:18.340 --> 01:12:21.379
We found a hooker
over on Ten Mile Road.

01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:24.010
She blew all four of us.

01:12:24.510 --> 01:12:26.979
Why didn't you say that
when you were questioned?

01:12:26.980 --> 01:12:29.349
We didn't think Mike
wanted his parents to know.

01:12:29.350 --> 01:12:31.749
You didn't want his father
to know he got a blow job?

01:12:31.750 --> 01:12:36.959
And was buying drugs. I wouldn't
want somebody telling my parents.

01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:38.990
So, what was the fight about?

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:42.729
Mike was in some dark mood.
I don't know why.

01:12:42.730 --> 01:12:46.330
And then he started saying
nasty things to that stripper.

01:12:46.340 --> 01:12:47.530
Like what?

01:12:47.700 --> 01:12:51.939
Stuff I'm not gonna repeat. The woman's
a stripper, not something on your shoe.

01:12:51.940 --> 01:12:55.640
Out in the parking lot, Penning
said Mike came at you swinging.

01:12:55.650 --> 01:12:57.279
Might have, I don't recall.

01:12:57.280 --> 01:13:00.319
What was different about that night?
That you had a knife?

01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:01.979
I don't need a knife, ma'am.

01:13:01.980 --> 01:13:04.489
I guess back in Iraq things are different.

01:13:04.490 --> 01:13:07.159
Somebody makes you mad,
you can deal with it, right?

01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:09.659
- You lost me.
- It's a whole different world.

01:13:09.660 --> 01:13:12.329
- You got power.
- You've never been in the Army.

01:13:12.330 --> 01:13:14.859
But I know that you've got
weapons and authority.

01:13:14.860 --> 01:13:18.369
You put men facedown in the dirt,
step on their backs, kick in doors.

01:13:18.370 --> 01:13:20.339
Somebody comes at you, you kill them.

01:13:20.340 --> 01:13:23.639
You have to. The guy could have
bombs, guns, you don't know.

01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:25.469
- Kill him first.
- You make the call.

01:13:25.470 --> 01:13:27.909
React or die, isn't that what they say?
Ever stab someone?

01:13:27.910 --> 01:13:31.649
- If I did, it wouldn't be your business.
- There one day, back here another.

01:13:31.650 --> 01:13:35.819
I gotta tell you, somebody comes
charging at me, I'd reach for my weapon.

01:13:35.820 --> 01:13:38.349
- The interview is over.
- I'm glad none of this bothered you.

01:13:38.350 --> 01:13:41.289
I gotta tell you,
I saw my father come back from war.

01:13:41.290 --> 01:13:43.989
Things he couldn't deal with
pretty much destroyed him.

01:13:43.990 --> 01:13:46.229
- What was he, in Panama?
- Enough.

01:13:46.230 --> 01:13:48.499
You have no idea what we did,
and we did it for you.

01:13:48.500 --> 01:13:49.899
- For me?
- If I were you...

01:13:49.900 --> 01:13:52.930
...I'd just say thanks, leave it at that,
and kiss my ass.

01:13:52.940 --> 01:13:54.630
Walk away.

01:13:56.040 --> 01:13:59.009
You happy now? You want to
convene a war-crimes tribunal?

01:13:59.010 --> 01:14:00.779
I want the clothes they wore.

01:14:00.780 --> 01:14:03.679
I want to take full-body photographs
for cuts and bruises.

01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:06.310
Ma'am, you can have
all the undies you want.

01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:11.040
But you might want to
take a glance at this.

01:14:14.990 --> 01:14:17.140
You still want them?

01:14:18.390 --> 01:14:19.420
Yeah.

01:14:53.460 --> 01:15:01.050
<i>Hey, you better hang up, Saddam could
be calling. "Mike, Mike, I give up."</i>

01:15:24.490 --> 01:15:28.160
<i>- Leave him alone!
- Fuck you, man.</i>

01:15:48.820 --> 01:15:52.480
<i>- Leave him alone!
- Fuck you, man.</i>

01:15:59.260 --> 01:16:02.529
You were right.
They couldn't have done it.

01:16:02.530 --> 01:16:05.599
They were with Mike
at the Chicken Shack at 1.

01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:11.609
Bonner, Penning and Long
arrived back at base 20 minutes later.

01:16:11.610 --> 01:16:16.040
The field where we found
Mike's remains is a half an hour away.

01:16:16.050 --> 01:16:18.909
There's no way they
could've driven there in time.

01:16:18.910 --> 01:16:20.780
Never mind...

01:16:22.620 --> 01:16:25.090
So they left him there?

01:16:25.490 --> 01:16:32.230
- They said Mike wanted to buy drugs.
- And that's why they lied?

01:16:37.970 --> 01:16:41.369
And they had no idea where he went
when they left him, or who he met?

01:16:41.370 --> 01:16:45.539
No. And I have statements
from every other man in the squad.

01:16:45.540 --> 01:16:47.340
May I see those?

01:16:51.250 --> 01:16:54.779
If they're telling the truth,
no one saw him after dinnertime.

01:16:54.780 --> 01:17:00.989
Yeah. Lab says no traces of blood
on their clothes or their belongings.

01:17:00.990 --> 01:17:03.389
Did you look at these clothes?

01:17:03.390 --> 01:17:05.059
I mean, look at this shirt.

01:17:05.060 --> 01:17:07.459
It has crease marks
where it came off the shelf.

01:17:07.460 --> 01:17:09.160
Clothes are cheap on the base.

01:17:09.170 --> 01:17:12.969
First thing you do when you get back
is toss every stitch you took with you.

01:17:12.970 --> 01:17:17.630
There are nine soldiers
in an infantry squad.

01:17:17.770 --> 01:17:19.509
- Yeah?
- They lost a man in Iraq.

01:17:19.510 --> 01:17:22.609
There ought to be seven statements here
and there's only six.

01:17:22.610 --> 01:17:24.609
So one of them's on leave.

01:17:24.610 --> 01:17:32.510
When I got here, the sergeant told me
all of his men were back from liberty.

01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:34.950
Read the names.

01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:37.989
<i>- Yeah.
- Hi, this is Fred Gainley...</i>

01:17:37.990 --> 01:17:41.599
...at the Buxton sheriff's office.
Are you missing a man?

01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:45.399
Because I have a Robert Ortiez here
on a drunk and disorderly...

01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:46.969
<i>...says he's one of yours.</i>

01:17:46.970 --> 01:17:51.269
- Thanks. I'll send someone over to get him.
- I appreciate it, thank you.

01:17:51.270 --> 01:17:52.600
He's AWOL.

01:17:52.780 --> 01:17:55.179
Check for priors and warrants.

01:17:55.180 --> 01:17:57.960
And see if he owns a car.

01:18:04.990 --> 01:18:06.450
Bad boy.

01:18:07.690 --> 01:18:09.089
<i>He's a local boy.</i>

01:18:09.090 --> 01:18:12.559
First arrested Bobby Ortiez
when he was 14, for drug trafficking.

01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:14.699
Got bail and the witness disappeared.

01:18:14.700 --> 01:18:17.529
A year and a half ago
we liked him for drug smuggling.

01:18:17.530 --> 01:18:19.830
Suddenly he gets all patriotic
and joins up.

01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:21.699
How did they let him in the Army?

01:18:21.700 --> 01:18:23.400
No felony convictions.

01:18:23.410 --> 01:18:26.109
They've lowered standards
every month since this started.

01:18:26.110 --> 01:18:29.309
There's a 1999 Chevrolet Malibu
registered in his name.

01:18:29.310 --> 01:18:30.970
What color?

01:18:31.980 --> 01:18:33.510
Blue.

01:18:33.880 --> 01:18:36.180
- That's not enough for a warrant.
- He's AWOL.

01:18:36.190 --> 01:18:38.189
The Army can go after him, we can't.

01:18:38.190 --> 01:18:42.059
Well, he's got four
unpaid parking tickets.

01:18:42.060 --> 01:18:43.870
Try Judge Osorio.

01:18:43.990 --> 01:18:46.259
Any idea where our boy might be?

01:18:46.260 --> 01:18:49.750
Finding Bobby's never the problem.

01:18:51.930 --> 01:18:55.900
Go back to your motel. I'll call you.

01:19:32.540 --> 01:19:34.270
Police! Open up!

01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:48.280
He's on the roof!

01:19:51.590 --> 01:19:53.250
I got him!

01:19:55.760 --> 01:20:01.600
Take the street, not the alley.
Take the street, jackass.

01:20:55.220 --> 01:20:56.890
Shit.

01:21:19.980 --> 01:21:24.890
Fucking wetbacks.
It's always knives, isn't it?

01:21:25.090 --> 01:21:27.900
You like cutting people up?

01:21:32.590 --> 01:21:34.659
What the hell are you doing?

01:21:34.660 --> 01:21:36.960
Come here! Come on! Get off him.

01:21:36.970 --> 01:21:38.869
Hey! I didn't do it!

01:21:38.870 --> 01:21:40.580
Don't you move.

01:21:40.740 --> 01:21:43.169
Don't you fucking move.

01:21:43.170 --> 01:21:45.039
- Jesus.
- You okay?

01:21:45.040 --> 01:21:46.530
Fuck.

01:21:56.290 --> 01:21:57.950
Change him up.

01:21:58.120 --> 01:21:59.610
All right.

01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:04.830
Good. We'll take him from here.

01:22:12.070 --> 01:22:15.899
What was it, chico? You wanted him
to carry drugs and he wouldn't do it?

01:22:15.900 --> 01:22:17.669
Is that it, chico?

01:22:17.670 --> 01:22:19.709
Afraid he was gonna tell on you?

01:22:19.710 --> 01:22:22.509
Wouldn't it be funny if the devil
looked just like you?

01:22:22.510 --> 01:22:26.349
Come back here, you wetback prick.
I'll show you what the devil looks like.

01:22:26.350 --> 01:22:27.910
Fuck you, man!

01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:32.519
- I see you cracked him wide open.
- Put your hand up.

01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:34.389
He isn't pressing any charges.

01:22:34.390 --> 01:22:38.029
And you're damn lucky I feel pity on you,
or I'd be doing it myself.

01:22:38.030 --> 01:22:39.590
I didn't mean to hit you.

01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:41.529
That's an apology in your world?

01:22:41.530 --> 01:22:43.050
I'm sorry.

01:22:43.230 --> 01:22:45.229
- Keep it.
- Won't anybody question him?

01:22:45.230 --> 01:22:48.339
I questioned him! They questioned him!
We searched his house.

01:22:48.340 --> 01:22:53.640
There's no evidence
he had anything to do with it.

01:23:58.240 --> 01:24:00.400
Something's happened.

01:24:02.410 --> 01:24:05.560
Found him hanging in his room.

01:24:10.420 --> 01:24:12.350
Jesus.

01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:16.380
- Did he leave a note?
- No.

01:24:43.150 --> 01:24:49.959
My father gave it to me when
I went to Vietnam. I gave it to Mike.

01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:52.529
It was in Bonner's pants pocket.

01:24:52.530 --> 01:24:54.620
He was carrying it?

01:24:56.370 --> 01:24:59.529
He didn't leave a note.
He put it in his pocket and hung himself?

01:24:59.530 --> 01:25:01.020
I'm sorry.

01:25:01.540 --> 01:25:05.539
But this is as close as we're
gonna get to a confession.

01:25:05.540 --> 01:25:07.200
Confession.

01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:19.220
Bonner's car. What color is it?

01:25:20.190 --> 01:25:22.850
Blue. Why?

01:25:33.340 --> 01:25:36.839
You don't kill someone for no reason.
That watch doesn't prove anything.

01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:38.709
Think your son would give him that?

01:25:38.710 --> 01:25:41.309
- It could've been planted.
- Why did he kill himself?

01:25:41.310 --> 01:25:43.409
I don't know. Tell me how he killed Mike.

01:25:43.410 --> 01:25:46.649
He had an alibi, he was at the base.
Why'd he kill him? When?

01:25:46.650 --> 01:25:48.190
I don't know.

01:25:56.890 --> 01:25:59.420
<i>- What?
- Hey.</i>

01:26:02.230 --> 01:26:08.240
You remember...? You remember
that woman with the dead dog?

01:27:10.330 --> 01:27:12.300
We drained it.

01:27:30.290 --> 01:27:32.150
Where's the boy?

01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:35.519
He wasn't home, thank God.
He was at his grandparents'.

01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:37.320
That's good.

01:27:37.960 --> 01:27:39.620
That's good.

01:28:54.370 --> 01:28:58.239
The remains will be shipped this afternoon.
Check the address of the funeral home.

01:28:58.240 --> 01:28:59.469
That's correct.

01:28:59.470 --> 01:29:04.680
If I can be of any other help,
just let me know.

01:30:07.980 --> 01:30:09.000
Sir?

01:30:13.150 --> 01:30:15.880
You got any jumper cables?

01:30:24.990 --> 01:30:26.460
Thanks.

01:30:30.400 --> 01:30:35.669
I wanted to say how sorry I am
for what happened to Mike.

01:30:35.670 --> 01:30:41.039
And I wanted to apologize for lying
about not seeing him that night.

01:30:41.040 --> 01:30:48.510
I just thought that if I were Mike,
I wouldn't want my parents to know.

01:30:49.220 --> 01:30:52.380
- You got a cigarette?
- Yeah.

01:31:10.340 --> 01:31:13.240
You think Bonner killed him?

01:31:14.780 --> 01:31:16.330
No.

01:31:17.580 --> 01:31:19.380
I don't know.

01:31:21.250 --> 01:31:24.550
I don't understand any of this.

01:31:25.790 --> 01:31:27.789
What would he have against my boy?

01:31:27.790 --> 01:31:29.380
Nothing.

01:31:31.230 --> 01:31:32.750
I'm sorry.

01:31:35.930 --> 01:31:39.799
- Mike tell you much about Bosnia?
- Some.

01:31:39.800 --> 01:31:46.369
We seemed to always pull sentry duty
together. Freezing our asses off.

01:31:46.370 --> 01:31:48.479
He tried to convince me
of crazy things.

01:31:48.480 --> 01:31:50.609
Try to get you to wear pantyhose?

01:31:50.610 --> 01:31:52.749
- Did he tell you?
- No, I told him.

01:31:52.750 --> 01:31:56.070
Cuts the cold like nothing else.

01:31:56.420 --> 01:31:57.989
So he wasn't lying?

01:31:57.990 --> 01:32:05.990
You don't want to get shot wearing
a pair of those. You'll never live it down.

01:32:25.950 --> 01:32:28.319
It's fucked up, isn't it?

01:32:28.320 --> 01:32:29.780
Yeah.

01:32:54.980 --> 01:32:57.179
<i>Let's get you to a good
American hospital.</i>

01:32:57.180 --> 01:32:59.879
<i>Come on, speed this thing up!</i>

01:32:59.880 --> 01:33:03.170
<i>It's okay. I'm gonna help you.</i>

01:33:03.790 --> 01:33:05.849
<i>It's okay. Take it easy.</i>

01:33:05.850 --> 01:33:09.570
<i>We're gonna take care of you, okay?</i>

01:33:12.690 --> 01:33:15.250
<i>You okay? You all right?</i>

01:33:16.100 --> 01:33:19.920
<i>Now, where does it hurt? Right there?</i>

01:33:20.640 --> 01:33:22.800
<i>Easy. Right there?</i>

01:33:23.200 --> 01:33:26.920
<i>We're gonna take care of you, okay?</i>

01:34:03.610 --> 01:34:05.040
Good night.

01:35:04.140 --> 01:35:08.779
Tell me that's your son's signature
on his credit-card receipt.

01:35:08.780 --> 01:35:10.770
No, it is not.

01:35:11.180 --> 01:35:13.910
We always assumed Mike was there.

01:35:13.920 --> 01:35:16.319
That's Penning's signature.

01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:20.150
Three meals. Penning, Bonner and Long.

01:35:55.960 --> 01:35:59.229
Penning and Long. I want them now.

01:35:59.230 --> 01:36:04.529
- I can't give them to you.
- Oh, yes, you can. And you will.

01:36:04.530 --> 01:36:07.069
Corporal Penning has come forward.

01:36:07.070 --> 01:36:10.390
He's implicated Long and Bonner.

01:36:10.740 --> 01:36:12.870
You son of a bitch.

01:36:13.010 --> 01:36:15.909
You went to him with a fucking deal,
didn't you?

01:36:15.910 --> 01:36:19.909
- He'll do serious time.
- Yeah? How serious, huh?

01:36:19.910 --> 01:36:22.780
How serious? How much time?

01:36:23.720 --> 01:36:26.260
As much as I could get.

01:36:27.860 --> 01:36:30.189
Well, luckily for me, that means shit.

01:36:30.190 --> 01:36:32.859
You see these? Those are warrants.

01:36:32.860 --> 01:36:36.259
We have jurisdiction,
you're compelled to deliver those men.

01:36:36.260 --> 01:36:38.060
I want them now.

01:36:39.370 --> 01:36:43.269
I am not the only one who made a deal.

01:36:43.270 --> 01:36:45.839
My C.O. Talked to yours.

01:36:45.840 --> 01:36:49.820
It is just one less headache for them.

01:36:50.040 --> 01:36:52.209
It's out of our hands now.

01:36:52.210 --> 01:36:53.740
I'm sorry.

01:36:55.620 --> 01:36:57.240
I bet you are.

01:37:00.720 --> 01:37:02.819
I wanna hear the confession.

01:37:02.820 --> 01:37:05.559
Long isn't speaking.
I'll get you Penning's statement.

01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:09.399
No, I wanna hear it from his lips,
and I want him present.

01:37:09.400 --> 01:37:11.960
That's not gonna happen.

01:37:15.040 --> 01:37:17.839
How many soldiers
leave this base every night...

01:37:17.840 --> 01:37:20.239
...to go visit a bar, have a drink or two?

01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:23.809
- I know you're feeling burned.
- I'm not burned, I'm fucking pissed off.

01:37:23.810 --> 01:37:27.649
Take a guess. On an average weekend,
what, seven, eight thousand soldiers?

01:37:27.650 --> 01:37:31.119
You know what? I'm gonna sit in my car
outside any of your entrances...

01:37:31.120 --> 01:37:34.219
...and pull over every vehicle
that comes back to this base...

01:37:34.220 --> 01:37:39.329
...and I will arrest every soldier whose blood
alcohol is 1/1000 over the legal limit.

01:37:39.330 --> 01:37:42.629
- How many men would that be?
- And how long till you're fired?

01:37:42.630 --> 01:37:45.499
I'll do it on my own time,
and we have a good union...

01:37:45.500 --> 01:37:48.099
...so I'm gonna say four to five weeks.

01:37:48.100 --> 01:37:53.069
How many DUI's do you think
I could make in a month?

01:37:53.070 --> 01:37:55.130
Should we find out?

01:38:13.660 --> 01:38:15.629
<i>Commander's office.</i>

01:38:15.630 --> 01:38:21.769
<i>- Let me speak to Captain Henning, please.
- One moment, sir.</i>

01:38:21.770 --> 01:38:23.639
<i>We were leaving the strip club.</i>

01:38:23.640 --> 01:38:26.469
And we thought that Mike and Bonner
have cooled down.

01:38:26.470 --> 01:38:30.479
They could be like that,
laughing one minute and fighting the next.

01:38:30.480 --> 01:38:33.309
Anyway, we're in the car,
and Mike's all pissy...

01:38:33.310 --> 01:38:36.549
...and Bonner just starts needling him.

01:38:36.550 --> 01:38:38.490
Just saying shit.

01:38:38.650 --> 01:38:40.310
Like what?

01:38:40.520 --> 01:38:44.389
I don't know.
Like what a good driver Mike is.

01:38:44.390 --> 01:38:46.489
Stuff that makes no sense.

01:38:46.490 --> 01:38:48.729
But Bonner has enough,
and he pulls over...

01:38:48.730 --> 01:38:52.629
...and they just start
going off on each other.

01:38:52.630 --> 01:38:56.239
And Long was yelling for them
to cut it out so we can go home.

01:38:56.240 --> 01:38:59.069
And Mike starts cussing at him too...

01:38:59.070 --> 01:39:03.339
...and then I look down,
and I'm stabbing him.

01:39:03.340 --> 01:39:05.280
You...? You are?

01:39:06.150 --> 01:39:07.550
Yeah.

01:39:10.420 --> 01:39:12.819
And your friends didn't try and stop you?

01:39:12.820 --> 01:39:16.380
I think they were sort of stunned.

01:39:16.760 --> 01:39:18.359
They're yelling.

01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:23.080
And Mike falls to the ground,
and he's dead.

01:39:23.230 --> 01:39:28.550
And Long is screaming,
"Christ, what do we do now?"

01:39:28.940 --> 01:39:32.439
It was Bonner's idea to chop him up.

01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:35.179
He used to work for a butcher.

01:39:35.180 --> 01:39:40.579
He knew how to work the knife
around the joints. Made it easier.

01:39:40.580 --> 01:39:43.419
We would've buried the parts...

01:39:43.420 --> 01:39:48.400
...but it was getting late
and we hadn't eaten.

01:39:49.020 --> 01:39:50.960
You were hungry?

01:39:51.130 --> 01:39:52.680
Starving.

01:39:54.700 --> 01:39:58.010
We stopped at the Chicken Shack.

01:39:59.970 --> 01:40:02.680
I liked Mike, we all did.

01:40:03.800 --> 01:40:11.779
But I think on another night that would've
been Mike with the knife and me in the field.

01:40:11.780 --> 01:40:14.910
I think he was the smart one.

01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:18.620
I think he could see.

01:40:22.590 --> 01:40:24.890
I'm truly sorry, sir.

01:40:26.430 --> 01:40:29.060
I'm sorry for your loss.

01:40:38.670 --> 01:40:41.270
I saw a video Mike shot.

01:40:41.280 --> 01:40:44.320
Him in the back of a Humvee.

01:40:47.450 --> 01:40:52.110
Looked like he was
torturing a prisoner or...

01:40:57.290 --> 01:41:01.590
We arrested some haji
who was wounded.

01:41:02.830 --> 01:41:05.650
And we were riding along...

01:41:05.730 --> 01:41:08.669
...and Mike was pretending
like he was a medic.

01:41:08.670 --> 01:41:13.869
And he would stick his hand
in this guy's wound...

01:41:13.870 --> 01:41:16.679
...and he says, "Does this hurt?"

01:41:16.680 --> 01:41:20.340
And the haji screamed, "Yeah, yeah."

01:41:20.980 --> 01:41:24.819
And then Mike would stick his hand
in the exact same place...

01:41:24.820 --> 01:41:27.810
...and say, "Does that hurt?"

01:41:31.790 --> 01:41:33.940
It was pretty funny.

01:41:37.060 --> 01:41:40.040
It became a thing with Mike.

01:41:41.740 --> 01:41:45.280
That's how he got the name "Doc."

01:41:46.240 --> 01:41:49.110
It was just a way to cope.

01:41:50.010 --> 01:41:52.660
We all did stupid things.

01:42:35.720 --> 01:42:37.710
Excuse me, sir.

01:42:56.110 --> 01:43:00.260
You know where Private Ortiez's room is?

01:43:08.860 --> 01:43:10.740
You got a minute?

01:43:13.490 --> 01:43:15.959
I need to apologize to you.

01:43:15.960 --> 01:43:18.299
You got some real serious issues, man.

01:43:18.300 --> 01:43:19.790
Yeah.

01:43:21.670 --> 01:43:23.300
That's true.

01:43:35.520 --> 01:43:40.049
I got a honorable discharge,
if you could believe it.

01:43:40.050 --> 01:43:43.940
It's the Army, I'll believe anything.

01:43:44.630 --> 01:43:47.010
I hated it over there.

01:43:47.030 --> 01:43:50.299
Sleep in fucking tents.
No toilets, no showers.

01:43:50.300 --> 01:43:54.120
No toilet paper, gotta use your hand.

01:43:54.340 --> 01:43:57.290
I couldn't wait to get out.

01:43:58.870 --> 01:44:01.280
After two weeks here...

01:44:03.340 --> 01:44:06.480
...all I wanna do is go back.

01:44:08.180 --> 01:44:10.280
How fucked is that?

01:44:20.330 --> 01:44:22.710
You know what that is?

01:44:26.500 --> 01:44:29.039
Mike took it and e-mailed it to me.

01:44:29.040 --> 01:44:31.340
Why would he do that?

01:44:38.210 --> 01:44:42.170
I don't know what anybody's told you.

01:44:42.850 --> 01:44:45.080
There are standing orders.

01:44:45.090 --> 01:44:46.889
You're in a convoy...

01:44:46.890 --> 01:44:50.089
...someone or something gets in front
of you, you do not stop.

01:44:50.090 --> 01:44:56.400
You stop, shitheads pop up
with RPG's and kill you all dead.

01:45:08.380 --> 01:45:10.940
First week in Iraq...

01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:13.849
...we're driving downrange.

01:45:13.850 --> 01:45:16.049
Six of us in the back.

01:45:16.050 --> 01:45:19.350
You can't see squat back there.

01:45:20.960 --> 01:45:22.950
Doc hit something.

01:45:24.760 --> 01:45:28.330
We hear it thump around underneath.

01:45:29.660 --> 01:45:31.430
He stops.

01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:33.330
Gets out.

01:45:34.500 --> 01:45:36.330
Drives on.

01:45:38.470 --> 01:45:40.200
Not a word.

01:45:42.780 --> 01:45:45.180
Later, some guy said...

01:45:45.250 --> 01:45:47.110
...we hit a kid.

01:45:47.650 --> 01:45:49.780
I don't believe it.

01:45:49.920 --> 01:45:51.940
You ask me...

01:45:53.950 --> 01:45:55.820
...we hit a dog.

01:45:57.930 --> 01:46:00.020
We killed a dog.

01:46:03.530 --> 01:46:06.400
I don't know what that is.

01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:10.700
No fucking idea.

01:46:36.400 --> 01:46:39.799
Hey, Bonner, there's your family.

01:46:39.800 --> 01:46:42.169
- Stop fucking around!
- It's a fucking phone.

01:46:42.170 --> 01:46:45.000
- You could have broken it.
- You're a fucking idiot.

01:46:45.010 --> 01:46:46.060
Oh, fuck.

01:46:46.970 --> 01:46:49.509
- Oh, shit.
- Do not stop! Do not fucking stop!

01:46:49.510 --> 01:46:53.490
- What do I do?
- Speed up! Speed up!

01:47:00.850 --> 01:47:03.359
<i>- What are you doing?
- Dad?</i>

01:47:03.360 --> 01:47:06.089
Get back in the fucking vehicle, Mike!

01:47:06.090 --> 01:47:09.259
Mike, get back in the fucking vehicle!

01:47:09.260 --> 01:47:10.700
<i>Daddy?</i>

01:47:18.070 --> 01:47:21.130
Let's go, Mike, now!

01:47:21.910 --> 01:47:24.140
<i>Are you there, Daddy?</i>

01:47:24.750 --> 01:47:27.130
I can hardly hear you.

01:47:28.620 --> 01:47:31.750
You gotta get me out of here.

01:47:32.450 --> 01:47:35.860
Well, that's just nerves talking.

01:47:37.360 --> 01:47:39.850
Something happened, Dad.

01:47:49.040 --> 01:47:51.010
For Christ's sake.

01:47:53.940 --> 01:47:56.670
Is anybody there with you?

01:47:58.410 --> 01:48:00.040
No, I'm alone.

01:48:03.620 --> 01:48:05.140
That's good.

01:48:06.990 --> 01:48:09.790
Okay, Daddy, I gotta go.

01:48:11.990 --> 01:48:13.890
You be safe, son.

01:48:14.060 --> 01:48:15.790
Stay safe.

01:48:17.160 --> 01:48:20.000
Yeah. You too.

01:48:49.130 --> 01:48:53.499
You know, my son's been driving me crazy
ever since you came over.

01:48:53.500 --> 01:48:55.760
He wants a slingshot.

01:49:00.310 --> 01:49:04.940
Guess it could be worse.
Could be a BB gun.

01:49:30.670 --> 01:49:31.810
Thank you.

01:51:24.080 --> 01:51:27.649
<i>So every day,
Goliath would walk into the valley...</i>

01:51:27.650 --> 01:51:31.180
...to challenge someone, anyone.

01:51:31.860 --> 01:51:34.750
But no one would fight him.

01:51:34.800 --> 01:51:37.159
Until David showed up...

01:51:37.160 --> 01:51:40.169
...and said, "You know what?
I'll do it. I'll fight him."

01:51:40.170 --> 01:51:44.169
So the king dressed David up
in his own armor, which was so big...

01:51:44.170 --> 01:51:48.300
But why would he let him fight a giant?

01:51:48.510 --> 01:51:50.550
He was just a boy.

01:51:53.280 --> 01:51:55.930
I don't know, sweetheart.

01:51:57.380 --> 01:52:00.270
Do you think he was scared?

01:52:00.750 --> 01:52:01.780
David?

01:52:07.730 --> 01:52:09.360
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:52:09.660 --> 01:52:13.900
<i>I think he would have been really scared.</i>

01:53:03.720 --> 01:53:06.749
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

01:53:06.750 --> 01:53:08.900
It looks really old.

01:53:09.690 --> 01:53:11.910
It's been well used.

01:53:22.240 --> 01:53:24.269
And I shouldn't take it down at night?

01:53:24.270 --> 01:53:25.830
No.

01:53:27.440 --> 01:53:30.420
You leave it just like that.

01:53:31.240 --> 01:53:33.460
That's a lot easier.
