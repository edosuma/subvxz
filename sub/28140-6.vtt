WEBVTT

00:25.480 --> 00:26.480
What?

00:30.280 --> 00:31.634
Mm.

00:31.680 --> 00:32.716
What do you think?

00:35.800 --> 00:36.800
I just...

00:38.320 --> 00:40.152
Go on.

00:45.480 --> 00:46.755
I just...
- Go on.

00:46.840 --> 00:47.840
I...

00:51.240 --> 00:52.833
I just can't believe you did that.

00:56.360 --> 00:57.396
I know.

01:05.120 --> 01:07.191
So good to see you.
- We're over the moon.

01:07.320 --> 01:09.437
Hey, good to see you.
- Love the shirt.

01:09.480 --> 01:10.400
Who is that?

01:10.401 --> 01:12.357
Ooh, is this a, uh...
- Don't. Come on.

01:12.960 --> 01:14.553
Ooh!

01:14.600 --> 01:16.114
Thank you.

01:16.360 --> 01:17.953
What's happened with the priest?

01:18.000 --> 01:19.400
Oh, pretty.
- Hi. Oh.

01:19.760 --> 01:20.720
Nothing.

01:20.721 --> 01:23.280
Oh, so good of you to come and get me.

01:23.440 --> 01:25.113
Get you?
- Uh, see me.

01:25.520 --> 01:26.840
Hi, Jake.
- Where's Claire?

01:26.920 --> 01:27.920
Just there.

01:28.440 --> 01:29.590
Your dad's just down there.

01:31.320 --> 01:32.515
Nice skirts.

01:32.600 --> 01:37.038
Do you need me to say
anything emotional about today?

01:37.160 --> 01:39.200
No, no. We're good.
- I think we're alright, thanks.

01:39.480 --> 01:42.040
Do you want tequila? I'm gonna get one.
- Hi. Nice to...

01:42.320 --> 01:43.320
How was Klare?

01:44.360 --> 01:45.760
Well, he's crazy about me

01:45.920 --> 01:47.673
so that's a nightmare.
- Nightmare.

01:47.720 --> 01:49.616
He's back to Finland today anyway,
which is good.

01:49.640 --> 01:51.760
It's fine. It's totally fine.
- Sounds like it's fine.

01:51.840 --> 01:52.840
It is.

01:55.680 --> 01:58.639
It's gonna be a lovely day, isn't it?
- I'm afraid so.

01:59.280 --> 02:02.352
This is my very interesting friend Daniel,
who's deaf.

02:02.400 --> 02:04.392
I picked him up
at a student gallery opening.

02:04.440 --> 02:05.715
Utterly fascinating.

02:05.800 --> 02:08.679
Can't hear a thing but is a fabulous
physical communicator

02:08.720 --> 02:09.870
through hands and lips.

02:11.039 --> 02:12.269
Oh! Oh...

02:13.200 --> 02:14.919
Oh, I love that.

02:14.960 --> 02:17.350
And this is
my extraordinary friend Francine.

02:17.400 --> 02:18.800
She's a lesbian.

02:18.920 --> 02:22.470
And this is Asif,
my bisexual Syrian refugee friend

02:22.600 --> 02:24.416
who you haven't actually met yet, darling.
- Hi.

02:24.440 --> 02:25.999
And, Asif, this is, um...

02:28.000 --> 02:30.276
Oh, my God. This is...

02:31.400 --> 02:34.438
This is... God, how extraordinary.
I just... I always call you "darling."

02:34.480 --> 02:36.631
This is the love of my life.

02:40.440 --> 02:41.320
Hi.

02:41.321 --> 02:44.358
Is there somewhere I can put this?
- We said no presents!

02:44.400 --> 02:45.914
Oh, you're such a sweetheart.

02:45.960 --> 02:47.633
She's a natural rule breaker.

02:47.960 --> 02:49.030
Not today.
- No.

02:49.320 --> 02:51.789
Ah, well, I've been trying
to get rid of it for ages, so...

02:51.840 --> 02:52.840
Oh.

02:53.960 --> 02:54.960
Thank you.

02:55.600 --> 02:58.513
I'm going to open it over a bin
so I've got somewhere to put the paper.

03:01.200 --> 03:02.714
Um, come with me.

03:05.760 --> 03:08.559
Uh, are you short on staff or what?

03:08.920 --> 03:10.115
Do you need me, or...?
- No.

03:10.160 --> 03:12.959
I just wondered if you had
a little show planned.

03:13.920 --> 03:15.798
What?
- Well, you normally do.

03:16.480 --> 03:18.995
And I wondered if there was anything
I might need to know about

03:19.040 --> 03:20.040
that might happen later.

03:20.360 --> 03:21.360
No.

03:21.760 --> 03:22.760
Good.

03:22.880 --> 03:24.712
Well, let me know
if you change your mind

03:25.080 --> 03:27.470
because today is the most
important day of my life.

03:28.080 --> 03:29.958
And I love your father very much.

03:30.680 --> 03:32.990
And I imagine you'd rather have me
looking after him

03:33.040 --> 03:35.191
in the years to come
than having to do it yourself.

03:35.760 --> 03:38.753
So, no more miscarriages.

03:51.280 --> 03:53.192
It's worth a lot, so...

03:58.040 --> 03:59.040
Thank you.

04:01.200 --> 04:03.431
I'll go and put her
straight back on her shelf.

04:08.240 --> 04:10.576
D'you know, I often thought it strange
that of all my pieces

04:10.600 --> 04:11.875
you chose to take her.

04:12.520 --> 04:14.910
Why?
- She was based on your mother.

04:18.640 --> 04:20.711
So nice to have her back in the house.

04:31.800 --> 04:32.800
Oh.
- Oh, fuck!

04:32.801 --> 04:34.096
Oh! God. Fuck, you're here.
- Oh, Jesus.

04:34.120 --> 04:35.679
I thought you were a fox.

04:35.720 --> 04:37.154
You're not.
- No. Are you...

04:37.240 --> 04:39.914
I didn't know you were...
- No, no, I'm fine. Sorry. I...

04:39.960 --> 04:41.816
No, I just didn't want to...
I'm practicing the homily.

04:41.840 --> 04:43.399
How's it going?
- Not good. Not good.

04:43.440 --> 04:44.476
I can't, I can't...

04:47.560 --> 04:48.560
You look lovely.

04:49.920 --> 04:51.513
Thank you. So do you.

04:52.280 --> 04:54.590
Wait till you see me in the full... shebang.

04:54.640 --> 04:56.871
You're gonna lose your fucking mind.

05:02.720 --> 05:04.996
We just need to get through this bit,
and then we can...

05:06.200 --> 05:07.200
We can...
- Yeah.

05:10.800 --> 05:11.995
Better get changed.
- Yeah.

05:12.320 --> 05:13.320
Good luck.

05:25.480 --> 05:27.073
Oh, my God.
- What?

05:27.520 --> 05:29.637
You have lipstick all...
- Oh, fucking hell.

05:29.960 --> 05:31.296
That would not look good. Is it gone?

05:31.320 --> 05:32.595
Where?

05:33.040 --> 05:34.156
Oh, fucking hell.

05:34.960 --> 05:36.314
I don't know, I don't know...

05:36.920 --> 05:38.479
Oh, I don't know what this feeling is.

05:40.880 --> 05:42.633
Is it God, or is it me?
- I don't know.

05:46.080 --> 05:47.080
I don't know.

05:58.360 --> 05:59.360
Fuck you, then.

06:09.480 --> 06:11.551
Where's your priest?
- Oh. I don't know.

06:11.960 --> 06:12.960
You OK?

06:13.880 --> 06:15.872
Yes, well, um... I hate my husband

06:15.920 --> 06:19.152
and the man I love is on his way to Finland,
so pretty weird.

06:19.560 --> 06:22.314
Oh, way to upstage the bride!

06:22.760 --> 06:23.720
Tried my best.

06:23.721 --> 06:25.598
Cute dress.

06:25.760 --> 06:27.353
Oh, look!

06:27.560 --> 06:29.199
Whoo!

06:29.400 --> 06:31.920
This is our very chic priest.
- Oh, good, I was aiming for chic.

06:32.080 --> 06:33.992
Particularly good around the, uh...
- Thank you.

06:34.640 --> 06:36.074
Father, you remember Martin.

06:36.120 --> 06:37.998
Hey, how you doing, man?
- Bit nervous, Martin.

06:38.040 --> 06:39.633
Do you know Jake?

06:39.680 --> 06:41.176
Yes, hello, Jake. How are you?
- Father.

06:41.200 --> 06:44.477
And this is my very interesting friend Lucy,
who is a surrogate.

06:44.600 --> 06:46.239
- Hello, Interesting Lucy.
- Weird.

06:46.560 --> 06:48.279
And this is my unstable step-daughter

06:48.320 --> 06:51.074
who's had a miscarriage.
- Nice to see you again.

06:51.240 --> 06:53.118
You, too.
- But you knew that. You were there.

06:53.160 --> 06:54.640
It was my miscarriage.

06:55.280 --> 06:56.350
What?

06:56.480 --> 06:58.995
It was my fucking miscarriage.

07:00.880 --> 07:03.156
Yes, I thought you'd find that funny.

07:03.360 --> 07:06.000
How interesting.
- She was just covering for me.

07:07.200 --> 07:09.635
We were pregnant?
- For a few weeks, yes.

07:09.840 --> 07:12.096
It was my baby?
- Sorry, so you haven't had a miscarriage?

07:12.120 --> 07:13.120
No. Sorry.

07:13.360 --> 07:16.080
Wait, what the fuck is going on here?
It-it was my baby?

07:16.600 --> 07:19.520
I guess it was your baby's way of saying
it didn't want you as its father.

07:21.400 --> 07:24.040
Like a goldfish out of the bowl
sort of thing.

07:24.520 --> 07:26.955
Sorry, but whoever had a miscarriage

07:27.000 --> 07:28.640
could you take it to the kitchen, please?

07:29.440 --> 07:31.193
No. Don't follow me, Jake.

07:31.600 --> 07:33.398
Oh, and this is over.

07:39.080 --> 07:40.958
Ah!

07:44.280 --> 07:45.280
Ooh.

07:47.680 --> 07:49.160
You're leaving me.
- No, no, no.

07:49.200 --> 07:50.998
Yes!
- Are you drunk?

07:51.120 --> 07:52.395
Yes.
- Are you sober?

07:52.440 --> 07:54.272
A bit. Could you just fuck off...

07:54.320 --> 07:55.674
Oh, absolutely not.
- OK, no, no.

07:55.720 --> 07:56.836
I'm staying right here.

07:58.800 --> 08:01.520
I want you to leave me.
- Listen to me. I just, I have...

08:01.560 --> 08:04.314
I think he has a little speech.
- I have a little speech

08:04.360 --> 08:05.396
that's building here.

08:05.560 --> 08:10.157
Now, I know you look at me and you see
a bad man with a big beard.

08:10.320 --> 08:12.630
You are an alcoholic,
and you tried it on with my sister.

08:13.680 --> 08:17.310
Fine. I tried to kiss your sister
on her birthday.

08:17.480 --> 08:19.233
- My birthday!
- Fine!

08:19.280 --> 08:22.239
I mix up birthdays,
and I have an alcohol problem

08:22.280 --> 08:24.351
just like everyone else
in this fucking country!

08:24.520 --> 08:27.240
But I am here, and I do things.

08:27.480 --> 08:29.233
I pick up Jake from shit.

08:29.280 --> 08:30.999
I make dessert for Easter.

08:31.040 --> 08:32.759
I organise the downstairs toilet.

08:32.919 --> 08:34.912
I fired the humming cleaner.

08:35.120 --> 08:37.270
You enjoyed that.
- I hoover the car.

08:37.360 --> 08:38.794
I put up all your certificates

08:38.840 --> 08:41.674
and I don't make you feel guilty
for not having sex with me.

08:41.720 --> 08:43.871
I am not a bad guy!

08:44.400 --> 08:47.234
I just have a bad personality.
It's not my fault.

08:47.560 --> 08:51.634
Some people are born
with fucked personalities.

08:51.920 --> 08:52.920
Look at Jake.

08:53.160 --> 08:55.914
He is so creepy. It's not his fault.

08:56.240 --> 08:57.833
Why the bassoon?

08:57.880 --> 08:59.360
You want to know what the bassoon is?

08:59.480 --> 09:01.711
It's a cry for help!

09:05.960 --> 09:09.510
The main fucking problem here
is that you don't like me.

09:15.480 --> 09:18.871
And that has been breaking
my fucking heart for 11 years.

09:19.440 --> 09:21.671
I love you. I make you laugh.

09:21.960 --> 09:23.872
I'm a douche, but I make you laugh.

09:23.960 --> 09:26.475
You said that that was
the most important thing!

09:35.520 --> 09:38.513
I think the thing that you hate the most
about yourself

09:38.560 --> 09:41.155
is that you actually love me.

09:46.080 --> 09:50.279
So, I am not going to leave you

09:50.560 --> 09:53.439
until you are down on your knees

09:54.200 --> 09:55.270
and begging me.

10:07.240 --> 10:09.630
Please leave me!

10:13.400 --> 10:15.357
Oh, man.

10:18.240 --> 10:20.118
I didn't think you'd do that in that dress.

10:22.800 --> 10:24.314
Right. Well...

10:29.120 --> 10:31.589
I guess the only thing left
for me to say is...

10:35.560 --> 10:36.560
Fuck you.

10:37.640 --> 10:38.640
Fuck you.

11:17.800 --> 11:19.393
What have you done with him?
- Who?

11:19.480 --> 11:20.480
Your father.

11:20.840 --> 11:23.355
The wedding is about to start
and no one can find him anywhere.

11:24.080 --> 11:25.400
Um...
- Can you do something?

11:25.960 --> 11:27.553
Please. Please.

11:29.600 --> 11:30.600
Please.

11:34.160 --> 11:35.196
Garden.
- Upstairs.

11:35.240 --> 11:36.240
OK.

11:47.920 --> 11:48.920
Dad?

11:54.560 --> 11:55.560
Dad.

11:56.560 --> 11:57.560
I can't get out.

11:59.520 --> 12:00.954
OK, Dad, you can.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.400
I can't. It's a trap.

12:02.880 --> 12:04.394
I'm stuck.
- No. Dad...

12:04.440 --> 12:06.909
J-Just, there's nothing I can do.
- Everyone will understand.

12:06.960 --> 12:09.880
Just give them all a bottle to take home.
Honestly, they will be relieved.

12:11.040 --> 12:12.872
My foot... is stuck.

12:13.800 --> 12:14.800
Oh.

12:15.600 --> 12:16.954
"Everyone will understand"?

12:17.840 --> 12:18.840
Um...

12:20.280 --> 12:22.237
W-Will you help me, please?
- Oh.

12:24.440 --> 12:26.272
How is it stuck?
- Just help me get it out.

12:26.320 --> 12:27.993
I'm going to be in so much trouble.

12:28.040 --> 12:29.952
What are you doing up here?
- I'm...

12:30.400 --> 12:33.837
I just remembered that I had left a...
a friendly mousetrap

12:33.880 --> 12:36.156
up here a few weeks ago,
and I hadn't checked it

12:36.200 --> 12:38.078
and I just wanted to make sure

12:38.120 --> 12:41.033
that one little chap
hadn't got, uh, trapped in it

12:41.080 --> 12:43.436
and was, uh...
was suffocating up here.

12:44.760 --> 12:45.760
Like...

12:50.680 --> 12:53.639
Think I've worked out what we need to do.
- Well, let's do it.

12:54.640 --> 12:55.640
Do it.

12:57.040 --> 12:58.040
Darling.

12:58.760 --> 13:00.560
I'll do it if you tell me
why you're up here.

13:01.200 --> 13:02.554
Just one honest answer.

13:03.880 --> 13:05.394
I... What? What, I...

13:05.720 --> 13:06.640
I don't think...

13:06.641 --> 13:07.869
One full sentence.

13:09.400 --> 13:12.154
I was checking on the mouse.

13:15.960 --> 13:16.960
Dad.

13:19.520 --> 13:20.656
Do you wanna make a run for it?

13:20.680 --> 13:22.456
I can smuggle you out
in one of Mum's dresses.

13:22.480 --> 13:24.392
You would, as well.

13:25.960 --> 13:28.031
No, I-I know she's not...

13:29.760 --> 13:31.160
everyone's cup of tea.

13:34.640 --> 13:36.393
And neither are you, darling.

13:37.120 --> 13:38.315
I mean, I'm sorry...

13:38.640 --> 13:43.032
I love you, but I'm not sure
that I like you all the time.

13:43.880 --> 13:44.880
Sorry.

13:45.200 --> 13:46.680
Hey, you created this monster.

13:48.520 --> 13:50.796
You're not the way you are because of me.

13:50.880 --> 13:51.880
I know.

13:52.320 --> 13:55.392
You're the way you are because of her.

13:57.600 --> 14:00.638
And it's those bits
that you need to cling to.

14:02.760 --> 14:04.672
Alright, can you get my shoe out?

14:05.680 --> 14:09.196
I just want you all to be proud of me.

14:10.200 --> 14:11.350
We are proud of you, Dad.

14:11.720 --> 14:14.440
You have two daughters who love you,
even if you don't like them.

14:14.560 --> 14:16.631
I like Claire.

14:16.840 --> 14:18.718
Jesus, Dad!

14:23.640 --> 14:25.518
Thank you.
- OK...

14:27.880 --> 14:28.880
Come on.

14:30.160 --> 14:31.833
I-I don't think I can go...

14:32.160 --> 14:33.674
Come on. Buck up.

14:34.200 --> 14:36.669
Smiles, charm. Off we go.

14:41.960 --> 14:45.317
I think you know how to love
better than any of us.

14:46.280 --> 14:48.715
That's why you find it all so painful.

14:54.280 --> 14:55.475
I don't find it painful.

15:04.800 --> 15:06.240
There, there, there.

15:06.760 --> 15:08.638
OK, go, go, go.

15:19.880 --> 15:20.880
OK, Dad.

15:21.200 --> 15:22.714
No, don't. Stay with me.

15:23.240 --> 15:24.240
Stay, stay.

15:31.160 --> 15:32.160
Hi.

15:46.200 --> 15:47.634
Darling.

15:47.680 --> 15:48.680
Sorry.

15:51.840 --> 15:53.240
Good afternoon, everybody.

15:53.640 --> 15:56.678
Thank you for coming today
to celebrate the love between

15:57.080 --> 15:58.719
these two very special people.

15:59.400 --> 16:03.155
Before we start, uh, Jake has asked
to play another piece on his bassoon.

16:13.240 --> 16:14.435
I can't do this reading.

16:15.720 --> 16:16.836
Don't do it.
- What?

16:17.160 --> 16:19.436
I'll do it.
You go and get him.

16:19.880 --> 16:21.280
I can't go and get him.

16:21.520 --> 16:23.557
Why not?
- It's too late.

16:23.600 --> 16:25.592
I can't leave my father's wedding.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.639
He's called "Klare" for God's sake

16:28.680 --> 16:30.512
and he's already at the airport anyway.

16:30.720 --> 16:31.720
Well, there you go.

16:32.400 --> 16:34.320
Is it "running through the airport"
kind of love?

16:34.360 --> 16:35.760
I'm not going to the airport.

16:35.800 --> 16:37.473
He'd think I was insane.
- Yeah.

16:37.920 --> 16:39.400
I'm just saying...
- The airport?

16:39.440 --> 16:40.556
How would I even find him?

16:40.640 --> 16:42.871
You can't get through security
without a boarding pass.

16:42.920 --> 16:44.936
No, I wasn't suggesting that...
- I'd have to buy a dummy ticket

16:44.960 --> 16:46.096
just to get through the gate.

16:46.120 --> 16:48.430
I don't know when his flight is
or which terminal.

16:48.560 --> 16:52.110
Imagine if I knew that.
Imagine him finding out I knew all that.

16:52.240 --> 16:54.709
Imagine if he was just in Boots
buying a pair of tweezers

16:54.760 --> 16:56.911
in Terminal Five,
and suddenly I was there.

16:57.040 --> 16:58.110
"Hello, Klare."

16:58.240 --> 16:59.640
Yeah. OK, that would be intense.

17:01.600 --> 17:03.720
The only person
I'd run through an airport for is you.

17:11.359 --> 17:13.920
Thank you, Jake,
for that beautiful bassoon piece

17:14.680 --> 17:16.398
uh, written specially for today.

17:16.760 --> 17:18.273
I believe it's called...

17:19.440 --> 17:20.440
"Where's Claire?"

17:26.160 --> 17:28.755
I think what you guys are doing is amazing.

17:30.240 --> 17:31.240
Sorry...

17:32.520 --> 17:33.520
Phew! Fuck me.

17:33.680 --> 17:36.195
Sorry. Didn't get much sleep last night.

17:36.680 --> 17:41.152
So, it turns out it's quite hard to come up
with something original to say about love

17:42.640 --> 17:43.710
but I've had a go.

17:52.320 --> 17:53.436
Love is awful.

17:53.800 --> 17:55.917
It's awful.

17:56.720 --> 17:57.680
It's painful.

17:57.681 --> 17:58.830
It's frightening.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.595
It makes you doubt yourself, judge yourself.

18:03.640 --> 18:06.360
Distance yourself
from the other people in your life.

18:06.400 --> 18:07.470
It makes you selfish.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.116
It makes you creepy!

18:09.400 --> 18:11.039
It makes you obsessed with your hair.

18:11.840 --> 18:13.069
It makes you cruel!

18:13.240 --> 18:15.994
It makes you say and do things
you never thought you would do!

18:16.240 --> 18:17.959
There's something wrong with your priest.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.879
It's all any of us want,
and it's hell when we get there!

18:21.000 --> 18:24.710
So no wonder it's something
we don't want to do on our own.

18:27.600 --> 18:29.273
I was taught, if we're born with love

18:29.320 --> 18:31.596
then life is about choosing
the right place to put it.

18:31.680 --> 18:33.876
People talk about that a lot,
it feeling right.

18:33.920 --> 18:35.274
"When it feels right, it's easy."

18:35.360 --> 18:36.794
But I'm not sure that's true.

18:38.440 --> 18:41.194
It takes strength to know what's right.

18:50.320 --> 18:53.438
And love isn't something
that weak people do.

18:55.600 --> 18:58.160
Being a romantic
takes a hell of a lot of hope.

19:01.680 --> 19:02.875
I think what they mean is...

19:04.960 --> 19:06.792
when you find somebody that you love...

19:10.480 --> 19:11.550
it feels like hope.

19:23.520 --> 19:25.830
Go out the side way.

19:26.440 --> 19:27.440
Now.

19:36.880 --> 19:40.032
So thank you for bringing us
all together here today.

19:41.160 --> 19:44.119
To take words from this book of love...

19:44.600 --> 19:47.354
"Be strong and take heart

19:48.560 --> 19:51.792
all you who hope in the Lord."

19:54.680 --> 19:57.149
Um, let's get on with the big bit.

20:09.960 --> 20:12.191
Oh. There you are.

20:12.760 --> 20:13.760
Hi.

20:17.960 --> 20:18.960
Huh.

20:24.600 --> 20:26.398
Ah...

20:27.160 --> 20:28.160
Oh, uh...

20:28.840 --> 20:30.672
Oh, fuck it.

20:34.960 --> 20:35.960
Thank you.

20:36.120 --> 20:37.120
Mm.

20:40.360 --> 20:41.396
And thank you.

20:44.920 --> 20:47.515
Oh, the, uh, priest is looking for you.

20:48.640 --> 20:49.640
Oh.

20:49.840 --> 20:51.672
Don't break his heart.

20:55.480 --> 20:56.776
Oh, well, thank you so much...
- Hiya.

20:56.800 --> 20:58.712
Oh, are you leaving?
- Oh, actually, well...

20:58.920 --> 21:01.310
I thought you were...
- I was changing.

21:01.400 --> 21:03.631
Oh, yeah.
- What do you do? Do you get the...

21:03.760 --> 21:05.513
Get the bus, or...?
- Yeah, I get the bus.

21:05.600 --> 21:07.273
On the road?
- Just on the road.

21:07.320 --> 21:08.595
I get on the bus.
- Cool.

21:08.920 --> 21:11.037
OK.
- Well, bye, my daughter.

21:11.640 --> 21:13.359
Bye, Father.

21:13.720 --> 21:14.949
Bye, Father.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.400
"Bye, Father."

21:17.200 --> 21:18.270
Goodbye.
- Bye.

21:38.120 --> 21:39.873
You nailed it.

21:48.160 --> 21:50.550
They always lie.
It'll magically come in a minute.

21:53.160 --> 21:54.160
Yeah.

21:55.520 --> 21:57.273
They're really into each other, those two.

21:57.320 --> 21:58.840
It's nice.
- They really pulled it off.

21:59.640 --> 22:01.680
Was your sister OK? She seemed...
- Yeah. She, um...

22:01.720 --> 22:03.518
Bit on edge.
- She's run off to a work thing.

22:03.560 --> 22:05.040
Wow. Dedicated.

22:05.120 --> 22:06.759
Addicted.

22:21.400 --> 22:22.595
It's God, isn't it?

22:26.840 --> 22:27.840
Yeah.

22:33.720 --> 22:35.552
Damn.

22:36.960 --> 22:37.960
Damn.

22:41.160 --> 22:42.719
You know, the worst thing is...

22:44.880 --> 22:46.394
that I fucking love you.

22:51.520 --> 22:52.520
I love you.

22:55.320 --> 22:56.470
No, no, don't.

22:56.920 --> 22:59.640
No, let's just leave that out there,
just for a second on its own.

23:02.320 --> 23:03.320
I love you.

23:15.560 --> 23:16.560
It'll pass.

23:33.480 --> 23:35.600
This bus is not magically coming.
- I think I'll walk.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.354
OK.

23:42.640 --> 23:43.960
Uh, see you Sunday?

23:44.640 --> 23:46.950
I'm joking, you're never ever allowed
in my church again.

23:51.080 --> 23:52.080
I love you, too.

23:59.600 --> 24:00.600
OK.
