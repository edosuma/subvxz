WEBVTT

00:01.920 --> 00:02.921
They're dead.

00:05.480 --> 00:06.481
They're all dead.

00:07.800 --> 00:09.768
<i>MARY: I am not trying to recruit you,
but you need to know.</i>

00:09.920 --> 00:10.967
<i>Things are changing.</i>

00:11.640 --> 00:14.450
You're just in time for the briefing.
I mean, that is, if you want to hear

00:14.600 --> 00:17.524
<i>how we're going to exterminate
every last vampire in America.</i>

00:17.760 --> 00:20.491
You're always playing the middle.
For once, why don't you pick a side?

00:21.080 --> 00:23.287
SAM: <i>The Hellhounds.
See, when you sell your soul to a demon,</i>

00:23.440 --> 00:24.805
<i>they're the ones that come
and rip it out of you.</i>

00:25.000 --> 00:26.889
- CROWLEY: Stay!
- You can control them?

00:29.560 --> 00:30.686
CROWLEY: <i>Getting you here...</i>

00:32.439 --> 00:34.920
<i>I managed to pervert that spell,</i>

00:35.080 --> 00:38.368
<i>so your essence
wasn't sent back to the Cage.</i>

00:38.520 --> 00:40.443
LUCIFER:
<i>How do you think this is going to end?</i>

00:40.640 --> 00:43.689
You're not even gonna see it coming,
when you get taken down.

00:43.840 --> 00:45.683
- By you?
- And my flesh and blood.

00:45.840 --> 00:47.444
<i>You remember Kelly Kline.</i>

00:47.600 --> 00:50.729
CASTIEL: <i>This is not a baby.
This is the spawn of Lucifer.</i>

00:52.080 --> 00:54.481
DAGON: <i>Kelly, the angels?
They want you dead.</i>

00:54.640 --> 00:55.880
But I can protect you.

00:56.040 --> 00:58.281
- I don't even know your name.
- Dagon.

00:59.120 --> 01:00.451
SAM: <i>The Alpha vampire is dead.</i>

01:01.280 --> 01:03.169
<i>You're changing the world.
And I want to be a part of it.</i>

01:03.320 --> 01:05.447
- I'm in.
- MICK: <i>And your brother?</i>

01:07.240 --> 01:08.401
Give me some time.

01:18.120 --> 01:19.167
MARCUS: Oh, my God.

01:19.320 --> 01:21.004
Babe, we're gonna need more wood.

01:25.920 --> 01:27.604
Okay, but first, check out this video.

01:27.760 --> 01:29.967
This bear goes crazy on these guys,
and he...

01:30.120 --> 01:32.327
Um, no. That's not why we come out here.

01:32.480 --> 01:36.929
We come out here to commune with nature,
not watch people get eaten by it.

01:37.080 --> 01:40.209
Okay. First of all, he doesn't eat them.

01:40.400 --> 01:44.530
He chases them up a tree, and they cry.
A lot.

01:44.840 --> 01:46.365
MAN: <i>What do they want?</i>

01:47.320 --> 01:51.405
It's hilarious.
And second of all, "Commune with nature"?

01:52.160 --> 01:55.004
I thought you brought me out here
to get naked and do weird stuff.

01:55.360 --> 01:57.647
Yeah, it's not gonna get that weird.

02:09.560 --> 02:10.925
I'll miss this.

02:11.920 --> 02:13.365
I'll miss you.

02:13.960 --> 02:15.325
And I get it.

02:15.560 --> 02:18.882
I mean, Washington has the best
veterinary program in the country.

02:19.800 --> 02:22.326
And you got in, I mean, you have to go.

02:23.680 --> 02:26.286
But people make this long-distance thing
work all the time, right?

02:28.240 --> 02:30.481
Right. Sure.

02:36.320 --> 02:38.163
I'm gonna go get more firewood.

02:39.240 --> 02:40.366
Okay.

02:48.880 --> 02:50.564
MARCUS: Will you marry me?

02:52.480 --> 02:53.766
Will you marry me?

02:57.320 --> 02:59.163
Just man up. She'll say yes.

03:39.920 --> 03:41.001
MARCUS: <i>Gwen, run!</i>

03:42.120 --> 03:43.167
Marcus?

03:43.360 --> 03:44.407
Ahhh!

03:45.720 --> 03:46.767
Oh, my God!

03:48.160 --> 03:49.161
Ahhh!

04:00.120 --> 04:01.121
Ahhh!

04:16.800 --> 04:18.882
DEAN: Whoo-hoo!

04:19.040 --> 04:21.007
Back to back to back.
That was one for the books.

04:21.160 --> 04:23.686
Yeah. Man, Dad loved this thing.

04:24.920 --> 04:28.367
- Dude, on the... Don't sit...
- What?

04:28.520 --> 04:32.366
Dean, you're covered in ghoul, man,
and wraith.

04:33.240 --> 04:35.641
And I think you have
a piece of siren in your hair.

04:41.960 --> 04:45.203
- Gross.
- Yeah.

04:47.760 --> 04:50.923
Dude, why don't you take a shower
and change your clothes?

04:51.080 --> 04:53.811
You've been wearing
the same pair of boxers for four days.

04:54.400 --> 04:57.882
Okay. One, weird that you know
how much underwear I packed.

04:58.040 --> 05:00.566
- That's what's weird about this?
- And, B, it's two and two.

05:00.720 --> 05:03.041
Doesn't count if you flip them inside out.

05:06.240 --> 05:08.720
DEAN: Oh.

05:08.880 --> 05:09.927
Got another case.

05:10.960 --> 05:13.566
Really? Already? How'd you do that?

05:14.160 --> 05:16.162
Same as the others.
I made a computer algorithm

05:16.320 --> 05:19.608
that scrapes data from police scanners,
emergency calls, uh, local news sites

05:19.760 --> 05:21.285
and it puts everything through a...

05:24.760 --> 05:26.808
The computer told me.

05:27.400 --> 05:30.643
Computers. Monsters, porn.

05:30.800 --> 05:35.089
Is there anything they can't do?
All right. Well, let's get to it then.

05:35.240 --> 05:38.244
Yeah. That's fine.
Uh, after you get cleaned up.

05:38.480 --> 05:41.768
- I got baby wipes in the car...
- Dude. Dean, I'm serious, man.

05:42.440 --> 05:43.771
You smell like roadkill.

05:46.120 --> 05:48.327
- It's 'cause I do all the heavy lifting.
- You...

05:48.920 --> 05:52.606
All right. I'm using that fancy shampoo
you keep hidden from me.

06:18.520 --> 06:21.967
Oh, really? Well, that's great, Mom.
No, we're fine. We...

06:22.120 --> 06:23.451
It sounds like something.

06:23.600 --> 06:25.125
- Yeah, love you, too.
- All right, Cass. Let us know.

06:25.320 --> 06:26.446
All right, bye.

06:26.640 --> 06:27.766
You first.

06:27.920 --> 06:29.649
Mom just finished working
a haunting in Akron.

06:29.800 --> 06:30.801
- With the Brits?
- Yeah.

06:30.960 --> 06:33.247
Great. Who you gonna call? Douchebusters.

06:34.080 --> 06:35.081
- What about you?
- That was Cass.

06:35.240 --> 06:38.722
He's in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho.
Someone's killing angels. Again.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.651
WAITRESS: All right. Sounds good.
I'll get your water shortly.

06:52.480 --> 06:55.484
Hello, how are you?
I'd like to speak to your manager,

06:55.680 --> 06:57.284
- if I could.
- HERB: <i>Hiya.</i>

06:57.560 --> 07:01.645
Hey. I'm, uh, Herb Nelson.
I run this joint.

07:01.840 --> 07:05.367
Pleasure to meet you, Agent Solange.

07:08.680 --> 07:10.205
I'm, uh, here about...

07:10.440 --> 07:12.568
Oh! I know why you're here.

07:13.440 --> 07:16.410
Uh, follow me. Quietly.

07:26.600 --> 07:27.681
What is this?

07:28.360 --> 07:33.082
Well, you know...
Can't be too careful.

07:33.440 --> 07:35.727
They're always watching, listening.

07:36.240 --> 07:38.368
- They are?
- Oh, yeah.

07:38.640 --> 07:40.369
But we're, uh, safe in here.

07:42.200 --> 07:45.363
Reinforced steel.
Nothing's getting through this sucker.

07:45.960 --> 07:48.042
CASTIEL: Oh. Yeah.

07:52.880 --> 07:55.724
So, uh, you're here about Sara.

07:57.320 --> 08:00.767
Yes, your waitress.
In this article, you said, uh...

08:01.240 --> 08:03.242
You said that she was killed by an alien.

08:03.640 --> 08:06.564
Well, not just aliens. Reptilians.

08:08.520 --> 08:11.091
You know, like the Queen of England.

08:12.640 --> 08:13.687
Right.

08:16.080 --> 08:18.606
Okay, well, that's very helpful.
Thank you so much for your time.

08:18.880 --> 08:20.689
And I got proof. Um...

08:22.320 --> 08:24.687
You know, see?

08:25.680 --> 08:30.322
Most sheeple can't handle the truth,
but not me. I'm woke.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.640
It's, uh, why I don't use, uh, new tech.

08:35.039 --> 08:37.611
Anything past '96, it's a trap.

08:38.919 --> 08:41.160
PalmPilot. It's more like tracking device.

08:41.440 --> 08:42.601
Am I right?

08:43.760 --> 08:44.921
Right.

08:45.320 --> 08:46.481
Exactly.

08:46.760 --> 08:48.330
Now watch this.

08:52.360 --> 08:53.964
<i>Now, here we go.</i>

08:55.600 --> 09:00.003
Okay, now, I don't know who she is.
Probably another alien.

09:00.440 --> 09:04.684
She's preggers,
so my money's on Brood Queen.

09:05.080 --> 09:07.890
Now, I don't know who he is either.

09:08.240 --> 09:12.962
There. That's Sara. Look, look, look.
See, silver knives?

09:14.520 --> 09:16.090
That's, uh, star metal.

09:21.640 --> 09:24.769
Yeah, the camera got fried, but you...

09:25.320 --> 09:26.526
You saw it, yeah?

09:27.120 --> 09:30.169
Right there.

09:34.280 --> 09:36.851
<i>- She has...
- Yellow eyes.</i>

09:38.520 --> 09:41.808
Like I said, Reptilian.
Now, the local cops, they...

09:42.600 --> 09:44.170
They think there's something...
They don't believe me.

09:44.320 --> 09:46.368
They think there's something weird
with the camera,

09:46.560 --> 09:48.050
but, I mean, that's why you're here.

09:48.200 --> 09:51.682
The FBI, the man in black.
Well, you know, beige!

09:51.960 --> 09:55.646
You ask me, a bear got him.
Maybe a cougar.

09:56.760 --> 09:59.604
Found a fair amount of blood over here,
and some there.

10:00.440 --> 10:01.601
But no body.

10:01.840 --> 10:03.968
Figure whatever did this dragged him off.

10:04.200 --> 10:08.524
So unless you guys are looking to make
a federal case on some critters...

10:08.680 --> 10:10.444
So, you said there was a survivor?

10:10.720 --> 10:13.041
Yeah, Gwen Hernandez, uh...

10:13.400 --> 10:16.210
But she's pretty shaken up.
Saying all sorts of strange things.

10:16.360 --> 10:17.407
Like what?

10:17.880 --> 10:22.169
Like, that they were attacked by a wolf.
An invisible wolf.

10:22.880 --> 10:27.044
Girl says that it came out of nowhere
and that it's coming after her next.

10:27.200 --> 10:28.361
DEAN: Right.

10:28.880 --> 10:30.723
Sheriff, thank you.

10:35.920 --> 10:37.524
An invisible dog, huh?

10:38.480 --> 10:40.209
Sounds like a Hellhound to me.

10:40.560 --> 10:41.686
Yeah.

10:47.360 --> 10:48.566
MARCUS: <i>Gwen, run!</i>

10:48.840 --> 10:49.966
GWEN: <i>Marcus?</i>

10:52.720 --> 10:54.085
GWEN: <i>Oh, my God!</i>

11:11.000 --> 11:13.241
This is dumb. It's a dumb idea.

11:13.440 --> 11:15.329
Listen, Gwen saw something
kill her boyfriend,

11:15.480 --> 11:17.642
and she thinks it's coming for her next.
We just gotta tell her...

11:17.800 --> 11:20.280
Tell her what? No, seriously, Sam.
What are you gonna say?

11:20.440 --> 11:23.284
"Hi. My name is Sam Winchester.
This is my much handsomer brother, Dean."

11:23.440 --> 11:25.408
"We hunt monsters.
Oh, and that guy you were banging,"

11:25.560 --> 11:27.130
"we're sure he made a deal with a demon."

11:27.280 --> 11:28.930
"So a Hellhound came
and dragged his soul to Hell."

11:29.120 --> 11:32.647
"But you, you're cool, and since there's
nothing around for us to kill, peace out."

11:33.600 --> 11:36.331
You done? Yeah, we don't say that, Dean.

11:36.480 --> 11:39.609
We say something that'll give her peace.
You know? Help her sleep at night.

11:39.800 --> 11:42.406
- Oh, so, we lie?
- Yeah, a lot.

11:50.960 --> 11:54.442
Gwen Hernandez? Uh, Agents Baker
and Clapton, FBI. May we come in?

11:54.600 --> 11:57.001
- I don't want any...
- SAM: We just wanna talk.

11:57.160 --> 11:58.889
That's all. About Marcus.

12:07.960 --> 12:09.086
Thanks.

12:16.040 --> 12:18.486
- Uh, you can have a seat.
- Right.

12:18.720 --> 12:22.850
Gwen, uh, we're here today
because we know what you told the police.

12:23.400 --> 12:27.007
That you feel like something supernatural
is after you.

12:27.840 --> 12:31.208
But we've concluded our investigation,
and the thing that killed your boyfriend...

12:31.360 --> 12:32.486
Was a bear.

12:33.920 --> 12:35.046
Was a bear.

12:36.200 --> 12:38.646
Now, we've found it and put it down.

12:38.800 --> 12:41.690
So, you're no longer
in any kind of danger, okay?

12:46.360 --> 12:49.921
I don't... I know what I saw.

12:51.680 --> 12:54.684
Gwen, when you go through
a traumatic event,

12:54.840 --> 12:56.888
sometimes your mind can make things up.

12:57.040 --> 12:58.041
Get out.

12:58.560 --> 12:59.561
Sorry?

12:59.880 --> 13:01.291
Get out of my house.

13:01.440 --> 13:03.044
Okay, calm down.
We're just trying to help.

13:03.200 --> 13:04.531
I don't need your help.

13:05.360 --> 13:07.124
I know what I saw.

13:07.280 --> 13:09.123
- Gwen...
- Get out!

13:12.560 --> 13:13.686
Okay.

13:25.040 --> 13:27.247
Oh, yeah. She's gonna sleep like a baby.

14:14.440 --> 14:15.930
Ahhh!

14:35.640 --> 14:39.042
Hey, hey, it's okay.
You're gonna be okay, all right?

14:44.360 --> 14:46.362
CROWLEY: Must really burn you,

14:46.840 --> 14:49.684
knowing I'm the one
that put you in this prison.

14:53.960 --> 14:54.961
Me.

14:58.200 --> 15:02.000
I own you, and I have big plans for us.

15:02.280 --> 15:03.281
Ooh!

15:04.200 --> 15:05.440
I'm flattered.

15:06.320 --> 15:11.451
All this hard work, all that...
You get 'em, slugger.

15:12.760 --> 15:15.445
I'm still gonna peel off your skin
and eat your soul.

15:15.680 --> 15:17.011
- Is that so?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

15:20.360 --> 15:23.443
I mean, it will be a little bit messy,

15:23.840 --> 15:27.765
but, you know, got to protect the rep,
you understand.

15:27.920 --> 15:31.003
I do, but you in those chains,

15:31.200 --> 15:33.851
I mean, forgive me
if I'm not quaking in my Testonis.

15:34.120 --> 15:37.044
Oh, I think both you and I understand
that this

15:38.040 --> 15:39.769
is just a temporary situation.

15:40.680 --> 15:41.681
Oh, do we?

15:42.200 --> 15:47.286
See, I understand that whatever
sad little scheme that you're brewing up,

15:47.800 --> 15:50.121
I'm already 10 steps ahead.

15:50.520 --> 15:52.409
And I thought pride was my sin.

15:52.680 --> 15:55.445
It's not pride, it's fact.

15:56.040 --> 15:58.725
You cross me, I crush you.

15:58.880 --> 16:02.202
You hit me, I hit you back twice as hard.

16:03.920 --> 16:07.925
You make me your dog, I make you my slave.

16:14.560 --> 16:16.449
{CHUCKLING)

16:16.640 --> 16:17.641
THOMAS: <i>Hello?</i>

16:19.040 --> 16:21.520
THOMAS: <i>Crowley. My Lord.</i>

16:22.080 --> 16:25.129
"My Lord." Duty calls.

16:28.720 --> 16:31.200
Don't worry about me,
I'll just sit right here.

16:39.400 --> 16:40.640
Yes, you will.

16:40.880 --> 16:41.881
Hmm.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.206
Kinky.

16:53.480 --> 16:54.481
What?

16:54.680 --> 16:57.411
THOMAS: Apologies, Your Excellence,
it's just, uh...

16:57.720 --> 16:59.404
<i>You're already an hour late
for the weekly meeting,</i>

16:59.560 --> 17:01.449
and we had to push last week's, so...

17:01.600 --> 17:05.400
You have 410 crossroad deals
that need senior management approval.

17:05.560 --> 17:10.726
On top of the 638 other matters
that require your immediate response.

17:13.440 --> 17:14.566
Fine.

17:15.839 --> 17:19.890
Gwen, that, um, thing was a Hellhound.

17:21.079 --> 17:22.286
A what?

17:22.440 --> 17:24.681
Hellhound. Kind of hard to explain.

17:25.200 --> 17:28.409
Uh, basically, giant,
invisible hounds from Hell.

17:30.240 --> 17:31.765
Well, that wasn't hard at all.

17:32.560 --> 17:35.689
So, you guys are not cops, are you?

17:37.320 --> 17:39.402
No, not exactly, um...

17:39.800 --> 17:44.169
My name is Sam, that's my brother, Dean,
and we hunt monsters.

17:44.680 --> 17:46.762
DEAN: <i>And we've tangled
with Hellhounds in the past.</i>

17:47.480 --> 17:49.130
Goofer dust will keep them out.

17:50.040 --> 17:52.168
A demon knife or an angel blade,
that'll kill them.

17:56.600 --> 18:00.969
Uh... Wait, so, why did you tell me
that Marcus got killed by a bear?

18:01.120 --> 18:03.487
Make you feel better. It was his idea.

18:07.800 --> 18:10.246
- Listen, I know this sounds insane.
- It does.

18:11.520 --> 18:16.890
But, like I said, I know what I saw,
and what I saw was insane.

18:17.080 --> 18:18.206
Right.

18:19.360 --> 18:21.044
Now this is awkward, but...

18:22.360 --> 18:28.129
Hellhounds only come after people
who sold their souls to a demon.

18:30.360 --> 18:33.091
So, about 10 years ago,
did you really want something?

18:33.560 --> 18:36.131
Like, I don't know,
a Hello Kitty backpack,

18:36.520 --> 18:37.885
or the death of an enemy?

18:38.600 --> 18:39.681
No.

18:42.160 --> 18:45.084
- What about Marcus? Did he, would he...
- No.

18:49.600 --> 18:50.601
Hmm.

18:51.400 --> 18:52.890
Great. So, what the hell?

18:53.200 --> 18:54.361
I don't know.

18:56.120 --> 18:57.884
But I do know who we can ask.

19:01.160 --> 19:03.970
VICTOR: And moving on to Case 41.

19:04.160 --> 19:07.687
Awar, a Rank Three demon,
claims to have had six babies,

19:07.840 --> 19:10.684
but then Morax, a Rank Two demon,
took two of his babies,

19:10.840 --> 19:14.401
which would leave Awar with,
yes, um, four babies.

19:14.680 --> 19:19.049
Which, I think we can all agree,
isn't enough babies for a decent meal.

19:20.320 --> 19:21.321
No, not at all.

19:21.480 --> 19:23.687
Awar is looking for compensation
in the form of...

19:23.840 --> 19:25.001
I don't care.

19:25.360 --> 19:26.600
<i>Moving on.</i>

19:26.840 --> 19:30.242
Me either.
Uh, moving on to Case 42.

19:30.520 --> 19:32.249
This is a good one. It's on tort reform.

19:32.600 --> 19:33.761
VICTOR: Yeah.

19:48.200 --> 19:49.440
What the hell do you want?

19:49.600 --> 19:52.604
All right, peaches, I get that
you're still upset about the whole...

19:52.760 --> 19:57.527
Upset? No, I'm totally over
how you and your little band of misfits

19:57.680 --> 19:59.205
<i>sent my son back in time.</i>

19:59.920 --> 20:00.967
<i>To die!</i>

20:03.160 --> 20:07.085
Okay. Look, that was totally Gavin's call,
all right?

20:07.320 --> 20:09.084
Uh, you know what?
We have a situation here.

20:09.440 --> 20:12.125
Oh, well, in that case, bye.

20:12.280 --> 20:13.645
<i>Hellhounds, Crowley.</i>

20:14.000 --> 20:16.924
And one of your mutts is going after folks
who didn't sell their souls.

20:17.080 --> 20:18.161
<i>It's not possible.</i>

20:18.400 --> 20:19.640
<i>You sure about that?</i>

20:21.800 --> 20:25.247
My hounds... You have anything to tell me?

20:27.400 --> 20:28.481
<i>Well?</i>

20:29.320 --> 20:32.449
<i>VICTOR: We, uh, didn't wanna bother you.</i>

20:33.320 --> 20:34.526
It was Ramsey.

20:36.120 --> 20:38.327
She got out, My Lord.

20:39.840 --> 20:43.447
Have the kennel guards killed. Painfully.

20:46.680 --> 20:47.727
I'll be right

20:47.880 --> 20:49.006
here.

20:56.120 --> 20:57.201
You miss me?

21:02.360 --> 21:03.361
Nice day out.

21:05.120 --> 21:06.246
Hello, brother.

21:07.320 --> 21:08.321
Kelvin.

21:08.560 --> 21:10.722
Oh, you remember?
We only met the once, so...

21:10.880 --> 21:12.120
What are you doing here?

21:12.280 --> 21:13.611
Same reason as you.

21:13.840 --> 21:17.162
Track down Kelly Kline
and that unholy bun she's got in her oven.

21:18.880 --> 21:20.928
So what do you say we help each other out?

21:23.160 --> 21:24.161
CROWLEY: <i>You have to understand.</i>

21:24.800 --> 21:27.531
This isn't just a Hellhound.
This is the Hellhound.

21:27.840 --> 21:28.966
That means what?

21:29.200 --> 21:31.328
Right after God said,
"Let there be light,"

21:31.680 --> 21:33.808
he made a whole a bunch of things.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.480
Posies, koalas, Hellhounds.

21:36.640 --> 21:40.406
He wanted the Creator's best friend,
but the hounds were too vicious.

21:40.600 --> 21:42.250
So he planned on having them all put down,

21:42.440 --> 21:46.126
until along came
our favorite fallen angel.

21:46.600 --> 21:50.400
He rescued one of the hounds.
A pregnant bitch named Ramsey.

21:50.720 --> 21:51.881
Why don't you just tell her to heel?

21:52.080 --> 21:56.449
I can't control her. No one can.
She's loyal only to Lucifer.

21:57.760 --> 21:59.922
Wait, like, the Devil?

22:00.320 --> 22:01.845
Yeah, but he's locked in a cage.

22:03.520 --> 22:05.170
- Oh, good.
- Yeah.

22:05.440 --> 22:07.568
All right, so where is Fido now?

22:08.000 --> 22:10.048
Well, if I had to hazard a guess,
I would say

22:10.240 --> 22:12.971
huddled up in some nice, warm den.

22:13.120 --> 22:14.565
Well, why is she after Gwen?

22:15.120 --> 22:16.167
Ask her.

22:17.520 --> 22:18.521
I...

22:19.440 --> 22:20.441
Um...

22:23.600 --> 22:25.921
When it attacked us, I did hit it.

22:27.760 --> 22:29.046
With an ax.

22:29.720 --> 22:30.846
Oh, there you go.

22:31.120 --> 22:33.088
Bitch does tend to hold a grudge.

22:33.560 --> 22:38.202
So, we either kill Ramsey,
or the hound eats her.

22:38.760 --> 22:40.444
Fun.

22:40.600 --> 22:43.126
Wait a second. "We"?

22:43.760 --> 22:45.967
Pup like that out and about,
it's not good for business.

22:46.120 --> 22:47.929
Makes it look like I'm not in control.

22:48.080 --> 22:50.970
But that mutt's head mounted on my wall?

22:51.120 --> 22:54.044
Good for the brand.
So, yes, Moose, for now, "we."

22:54.280 --> 22:58.569
Great. So we have a Hellhound who's
gunning for revenge, and it's personal.

22:58.720 --> 23:00.961
Just when I just thought this gig
couldn't get any weirder.

23:01.120 --> 23:03.771
Oh. It can always get weirder.

23:22.680 --> 23:23.806
I knew it.

23:25.800 --> 23:27.040
Hi, guys.

23:39.320 --> 23:42.324
My Lord, I'm not worthy.

23:43.400 --> 23:44.606
Thank you very much.

23:45.560 --> 23:47.688
We knew Crowley was up to something.

23:47.840 --> 23:49.410
The way he's been acting,

23:49.680 --> 23:52.286
and how he snuffed out everyone
who was part of the Cage project...

23:52.960 --> 23:56.760
And a lot of us really don't like Crowley.
He's very prancy.

23:56.920 --> 24:00.970
So, we released your hound
to create a distraction.

24:01.600 --> 24:02.931
To see what he was hiding.

24:03.360 --> 24:06.682
- We...
- We hoped... We knew it could only be you.

24:07.320 --> 24:08.446
Mmm... Mmm-hmm.

24:10.400 --> 24:11.731
And we brought this.

24:20.600 --> 24:22.967
Can you get these off me?

24:23.120 --> 24:24.121
But, but...

24:26.080 --> 24:28.367
Before we let you out,

24:28.640 --> 24:32.725
we have a few, well,
I wouldn't call them demands exactly.

24:33.640 --> 24:35.563
- But...
- Huh.

24:39.560 --> 24:42.291
So Hellhounds are invisible to humans,

24:43.080 --> 24:45.765
unless you've sold your soul
and they're after you.

24:45.960 --> 24:50.045
Or, uh, you're wearing a pair of these,
which are glasses treated with holy fire.

24:51.400 --> 24:53.368
All right, Crowley and I
are gonna hit the woods.

24:53.520 --> 24:54.931
See if we can't track down Cujo.

24:55.080 --> 24:56.650
You stick with Sam, he'll keep you safe.

24:57.160 --> 24:58.161
Okay.

25:00.560 --> 25:01.721
Take care of her.

25:01.920 --> 25:02.921
Of course.

25:03.800 --> 25:06.246
Dean, look, even if Ramsey circles back,
as long as we keep moving,

25:06.440 --> 25:08.249
Gwen's gonna be just...

25:11.080 --> 25:13.162
- You're talking about the car.
- You tend to ride the brakes.

25:13.360 --> 25:15.089
- Dean, I know how to drive.
- I'm just saying.

25:15.960 --> 25:19.203
Okay, just imagine
she's a beautiful woman.

25:19.360 --> 25:21.203
- Oh, come on. Get out of here.
- A beautiful, beautiful woman.

25:21.360 --> 25:22.441
- I'm done.
- Sam.

25:26.440 --> 25:27.441
You.

25:29.280 --> 25:30.441
Come on.

25:42.640 --> 25:45.120
- So, how are things in Heaven?
- KELVIN: Functional.

25:46.120 --> 25:47.929
You know, there's the usual infighting,

25:48.080 --> 25:52.927
but let's just say Lucifer having a baby
on board has brought us all together.

25:55.320 --> 25:58.244
You know, this is
an all-hands-on-deck situation, Castiel.

25:59.160 --> 26:00.400
Including yours.

26:01.320 --> 26:03.243
Okay, so you're here for my hands?

26:03.960 --> 26:05.246
We want you.

26:05.680 --> 26:09.002
Look, you got more field experience
than the next thousand angels combined.

26:09.280 --> 26:11.044
Yeah, I think you overestimate me.

26:11.400 --> 26:12.481
I don't.

26:13.800 --> 26:16.007
Look, I know
you're working with the Winchesters.

26:16.360 --> 26:17.805
Sam and Dean.

26:18.120 --> 26:19.485
Their hearts are in the right place,

26:19.680 --> 26:23.321
but wouldn't it be better to have us
waiting in the proverbial wings?

26:23.640 --> 26:26.041
Or the power of Heaven behind you?

26:30.320 --> 26:32.846
You ever miss it? Upstairs?

26:33.600 --> 26:37.400
I mean, don't get me wrong, I love Earth.
It's quirky, smells like hay.

26:38.360 --> 26:40.567
But it's not home, is it?

26:45.240 --> 26:46.844
I don't believe I'm welcome in Heaven.

26:47.040 --> 26:50.169
No, you're not.
They still hold a lot of grudges up there.

26:52.040 --> 26:54.168
But what if I told you
you could come back?

26:55.360 --> 26:59.365
That all your sins
could be forgotten, forgiven.

26:59.600 --> 27:01.170
I would say that you're lying.

27:01.400 --> 27:02.526
Oh, but I'm not.

27:03.480 --> 27:07.405
You help us track down Kelly Kline,
and you'll be welcomed back into the fold.

27:09.960 --> 27:13.089
Right. And you have the power to do that?

27:13.560 --> 27:15.403
Oh, no, I can't. I'm just the messenger.

27:17.560 --> 27:18.846
But Joshua can.

27:23.600 --> 27:24.761
Joshua?

27:27.240 --> 27:28.730
I thought he stepped aside.

27:28.880 --> 27:33.647
He did, but like I said,
all-hands-on-deck situation.

27:35.640 --> 27:40.089
<i>Imagine it, Castiel.
Free to come and go as you please.</i>

27:40.560 --> 27:44.201
<i>Part of your family,
your true family again.</i>

27:48.600 --> 27:51.649
Look, the gardener's got a plan.

27:52.320 --> 27:57.167
All we ask is that you hear us.
Hear him out.

28:00.400 --> 28:01.731
For the greater good.

28:06.160 --> 28:08.561
VICTOR: <i>All right-on, and lastly.</i>

28:09.120 --> 28:12.761
You will grant me 1,000 souls per year.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.287
And you will anoint me

28:16.280 --> 28:19.363
the new King of the Crossroads.

28:22.520 --> 28:25.251
Great. Tommy, you want anything, man?

28:26.200 --> 28:29.522
The only thing I care about
is making Hell great again.

28:31.280 --> 28:32.281
See?

28:33.480 --> 28:35.482
What?

28:38.520 --> 28:40.522
All right. Let's do this.

28:42.040 --> 28:44.281
Here we go, My Lord.

28:49.800 --> 28:50.801
Oh.

28:52.000 --> 28:53.764
Oh!

28:56.560 --> 28:59.370
It feels so good.

29:02.560 --> 29:04.449
We had a deal.

29:04.720 --> 29:05.926
Did we?

29:15.600 --> 29:19.207
Sorry, kid. You understand, right?
No witnesses or anything, yeah?

29:19.400 --> 29:22.768
Yes! Take me, oh, Fallen One!
My life is yours to devour.

29:25.600 --> 29:27.284
See, now you just made it weird.

29:36.160 --> 29:37.161
Hmm.

29:43.160 --> 29:44.241
CROWLEY: Fancy.

29:44.600 --> 29:46.125
Really bring out your eyes.

29:46.280 --> 29:47.725
- Shut up.
- "Shut up."

29:48.880 --> 29:50.530
- I mean it, Crowley.
- "I mean it, Crowley."

29:50.960 --> 29:52.405
- Go to Hell.
- "Go to Hell."

29:53.800 --> 29:57.600
Really, Dean, all these years,
you're so predictable.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.729
Yeah, well, guess we've all changed.

30:00.200 --> 30:02.407
I got predictable, you got soft.

30:02.920 --> 30:04.081
I mean, a few years ago,
who'd have thought

30:04.280 --> 30:06.123
you'd be helping us
save the girl of the week?

30:06.320 --> 30:07.560
I don't care about her.

30:08.160 --> 30:09.969
Yeah, well, maybe we rubbed off on you.

30:10.160 --> 30:11.446
Don't flatter yourself.

30:12.080 --> 30:13.241
You saved Cass.

30:13.840 --> 30:16.491
Just to spare myself
the Winchester man pain.

30:16.640 --> 30:19.007
You lot moping about
like a bunch of schoolgirls.

30:19.160 --> 30:21.128
Well, I just wanna say, "Thank you."

30:21.320 --> 30:24.403
Or, a few years ago,
who would have thought

30:24.560 --> 30:26.403
you'd be working with the King of Hell?

30:26.880 --> 30:28.484
Maybe you've rubbed off on me,

30:29.240 --> 30:34.167
maybe I've rubbed off all over you.

30:46.760 --> 30:47.966
I'm sorry.

30:49.920 --> 30:51.160
For what?

30:51.600 --> 30:54.285
This. It's all my fault.

30:55.240 --> 30:56.651
Gwen, this is not your fault.

30:56.800 --> 30:57.961
<i>Yes, it is.</i>

30:58.680 --> 31:00.409
What happened to Marcus...

31:01.080 --> 31:02.411
MARCUS: <i>Gwen, run!</i>

31:06.600 --> 31:08.841
Pull over. Please.

31:09.120 --> 31:10.167
Okay.

31:16.440 --> 31:20.968
♪ <i>Hunting we will go,</i>
a <i>hunting we will go</i> ♪

31:21.120 --> 31:23.361
Crowley, shut up. Seriously.

31:41.480 --> 31:44.484
Ramsey dragged him back to her den.

31:46.480 --> 31:49.211
Well, it's empty. So where is she now?

31:55.720 --> 31:56.846
You okay?

32:01.560 --> 32:04.564
I don't think I even know
what "okay" means anymore.

32:08.960 --> 32:13.204
Marcus... Going camping was my idea.

32:14.680 --> 32:17.251
I took him out there even though I knew.

32:19.040 --> 32:20.405
I knew it was over.

32:25.200 --> 32:26.725
I liked Marcus.

32:27.880 --> 32:30.690
He was sweet and kind,

32:31.240 --> 32:32.651
and he loved me.

32:36.440 --> 32:39.330
More than I ever loved him, more than...

32:42.680 --> 32:45.331
If I'd just told him, if I'd...

32:46.400 --> 32:48.562
<i>Why couldn't I just tell him the truth?</i>

32:51.760 --> 32:55.606
- Gwen...
- Yeah, but I didn't. I lied.

32:55.960 --> 32:59.089
I lied to make things easier. I...

33:10.600 --> 33:12.409
I'm sorry. I...

33:13.320 --> 33:14.481
We should go.

33:19.040 --> 33:20.166
Right.

33:23.240 --> 33:25.083
- What?
- She's here.

33:32.720 --> 33:34.563
It's okay, it's okay. Stay calm.

33:36.320 --> 33:37.367
Oh, my God.

33:37.760 --> 33:38.921
All right.

33:50.880 --> 33:52.928
- We should leave.
- No, no, Gwen.

33:53.080 --> 33:55.765
I got to take care of this.
It's the only way she'll stop.

34:01.000 --> 34:03.128
- Stay in the car. Stay in the car!
- Okay.

35:02.560 --> 35:04.164
And this is why you don't drive.

35:04.680 --> 35:06.842
So, it's over?

35:07.880 --> 35:09.120
It's over.

35:10.200 --> 35:11.361
Thank you.

35:11.520 --> 35:12.601
Yeah.

35:16.160 --> 35:18.561
Ah. Dog dead, must be going.

35:18.760 --> 35:20.364
Hey, Crowley, wait a second. Um...

35:24.600 --> 35:25.806
Thank you.

35:36.040 --> 35:38.566
- He seems nice.
- DEAN: Yeah.

35:44.800 --> 35:46.848
Let's get in. Hopefully, it still runs.

35:58.560 --> 36:03.521
Now, what was that you were saying
about always being two steps ahead?

36:23.080 --> 36:25.048
Buh-bye, Crowley.

36:27.640 --> 36:29.130
That's not what I said.

36:33.320 --> 36:34.560
Uh, what the...

36:38.120 --> 36:40.407
I'm glad you've had
a little taste of freedom.

36:41.320 --> 36:45.370
What I said was,
I'm always 10 steps ahead.

36:46.360 --> 36:49.125
I said you cross me, I crush you.
You hit me...

36:49.320 --> 36:52.130
- Ahhh!
- I hit you back twice as hard.

36:52.280 --> 36:53.611
Ahhh!

36:54.160 --> 36:56.891
You make me your dog,
I'll make you my slave.

37:00.840 --> 37:03.446
HOW?

37:09.360 --> 37:12.728
That chain around your neck.
It was nothing.

37:12.920 --> 37:14.604
A stylish accessory.

37:15.320 --> 37:19.484
This vessel, that's your true prison.

37:20.560 --> 37:26.966
It's been warded with runes and spellwork
from the Cage carved into every molecule.

37:28.120 --> 37:29.246
In there?

37:30.000 --> 37:32.367
I own you.

37:35.120 --> 37:37.964
I'm just getting started, so...

37:38.360 --> 37:41.489
I'm gonna put you back in your hole,
and then I'm gonna go find your spawn,

37:41.640 --> 37:44.564
and I'm gonna rip him apart
while you watch.

37:45.240 --> 37:46.287
And then...

37:53.680 --> 37:56.445
I'm still just getting started.

38:01.560 --> 38:02.561
Cass, what's up?

38:02.720 --> 38:04.927
CASTIEL: <i>Hey, I think I have a lead on Kelly Kline.</i>

38:05.120 --> 38:06.201
DEAN: <i>Yeah?</i>

38:06.440 --> 38:08.363
She's with Dagon. Prince of Hell.

38:08.520 --> 38:09.931
All right, what do we know about him?

38:10.080 --> 38:14.722
Actually, it's a her, and not much.
It's just rumors and stories.

38:15.280 --> 38:18.329
<i>Dagon is mostly known
for her psychotic savagery.</i>

38:18.800 --> 38:21.087
Great. So where's Kelly?

38:22.400 --> 38:24.368
Well, she was in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho.

38:24.520 --> 38:27.569
<i>Now... I'm not sure.</i>

38:28.320 --> 38:30.721
All right. We'll spread the word.
Let us know if you find anything.

38:31.000 --> 38:32.889
Of course.

38:34.880 --> 38:36.245
KELVIN: <i>You ready, brother?</i>

38:47.560 --> 38:48.766
He sound weird to you?

38:51.240 --> 38:53.447
Oh, is that your computer
talking to you again?

38:59.280 --> 39:01.647
Uh... No.

39:03.040 --> 39:05.611
It's Mick Davies.

39:06.160 --> 39:07.286
What?

39:07.520 --> 39:13.607
Dean, I don't have a computer program
feeding me cases, I, uh...

39:15.600 --> 39:19.047
Gwen, every job we've worked
in the last two weeks,

39:19.960 --> 39:21.644
they've all come from
the British Men of Letters.

39:23.840 --> 39:25.001
Really?

39:25.160 --> 39:28.289
Yeah. I didn't tell you
'cause I know how much you hate them...

39:28.440 --> 39:30.886
No, we hate them. Us. Together.

39:31.040 --> 39:33.042
Right, I get that. Yeah, I do, but...

39:34.960 --> 39:38.362
Dean, because of Mick and his guys,
the Alpha vampire is dead.

39:40.480 --> 39:42.323
They get results.
I don't like them either,

39:42.520 --> 39:44.522
but if we can save people, then it...

39:52.280 --> 39:54.851
Either way, I shouldn't have lied to you,

39:56.280 --> 39:57.850
and I'm sorry, man. I...

40:01.920 --> 40:03.206
Well, okay.

40:04.440 --> 40:05.521
"Okay"?

40:08.040 --> 40:11.283
What do you want me to say?
Do I like it? No.

40:11.440 --> 40:13.568
Do I trust them? Hell, no.

40:17.040 --> 40:18.280
But you're right.

40:22.800 --> 40:24.211
We work with people
we don't trust all the time.

40:24.400 --> 40:26.607
I mean, hell, I just Liam Neeson'd it up
with Crowley.

40:29.320 --> 40:32.085
So if you wanna give this a shot...

40:32.920 --> 40:34.843
Then fine.

40:37.720 --> 40:41.645
But the minute, and I mean the second
something feels off, we bail.

40:41.840 --> 40:43.080
Yeah. Of course. Deal.

40:51.040 --> 40:52.087
It's Mick.

40:56.520 --> 40:57.681
Pick it up.

41:02.680 --> 41:04.887
This is Sam.
