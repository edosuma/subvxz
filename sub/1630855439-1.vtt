12:55.731 --> 12:57.124
for Tiberius and Vipsania.

12:57.167 --> 13:00.257
[clears throat] 900.

13:00.301 --> 13:01.302
Or maybe not.

13:01.345 --> 13:03.347
900.

13:03.391 --> 13:06.002
I am Livia,
daughter of Marcus Livius

13:06.046 --> 13:08.265
and the wife of Caesar Augustus.

13:08.309 --> 13:10.224
-[crowd laughing]
-Livia?

13:10.267 --> 13:13.096
And I will give 50,000 in silver

13:13.140 --> 13:15.055
to anyone who takes a message
to my husband.

13:15.098 --> 13:17.231
-And a sense of humor.
-[laughter]

13:17.274 --> 13:19.102
800, priced to clear.

13:19.146 --> 13:20.408
Livia...

13:20.451 --> 13:23.019
-[slaver] 500!
-[Piso] Livia!

13:23.063 --> 13:24.368
-Piso!
-[Piso] Livia!

13:24.412 --> 13:27.676
I am Gaius Calpernius Piso!

13:27.719 --> 13:30.070
Cut this woman loose, now!

13:30.113 --> 13:33.682
-Cut her loose.
-What took you so long, huh?

13:33.725 --> 13:36.032
I was waiting for the price
to bottom out.

13:36.076 --> 13:38.252
[panting]

13:38.295 --> 13:41.081
You! I want that last girl
back here now!

13:45.912 --> 13:48.131
Livia! What the fuck happened?

13:48.175 --> 13:49.393
You wanted to know
what people are thinking.

13:49.437 --> 13:50.742
That'swhat happened!

13:50.786 --> 13:51.439
We were up all night
looking for you.

13:51.482 --> 13:52.832
-Good!
-Livia!

13:55.051 --> 13:56.836
It's a full-scale
fucking famine.

13:56.879 --> 13:58.794
I can't rule Rome
if I can't feed it.

13:58.838 --> 14:00.056
I know.

14:00.100 --> 14:01.579
I've summoned
the grain prefects.

14:01.623 --> 14:04.844
-I want you to listen in.
-Well, I'll be in the bath!

14:08.369 --> 14:10.066
Burn that fucking whorehouse
to the ground!

14:24.341 --> 14:26.300
[gasps]

14:29.477 --> 14:32.219
You must be Aelina. Hmm?

14:32.262 --> 14:36.745
I'm Livia.

14:51.455 --> 14:52.804
Tycho.

14:52.848 --> 14:55.503
You gave us a fright.

14:58.549 --> 15:00.160
Oh...

15:03.163 --> 15:04.947
She's so beautiful.

15:04.991 --> 15:07.732
Yeah.

15:11.171 --> 15:14.261
So like Antigone.

15:17.873 --> 15:21.311
She left something for you.

15:21.355 --> 15:28.231
She had a little time at the end
to... well, make preparations.

15:28.275 --> 15:32.975
She said she would wait for you
by the river in the underworld,

15:33.019 --> 15:35.760
and she wanted you
to have this.

15:39.547 --> 15:40.983
Her poisons.

15:41.027 --> 15:43.203
Yes, she said you were bound
to need them.

15:45.161 --> 15:48.948
Ah, er, forgive me, I...

15:48.991 --> 15:51.167
[Aelina babbling]

15:51.211 --> 15:53.822
[gasps]

15:53.865 --> 15:58.958
There's something that I never
dared ask you in a letter.

15:59.001 --> 16:00.437
[sighs]

16:06.313 --> 16:09.969
Deep down, Gaius knows
we killed Marcellus.

16:10.012 --> 16:12.319
But he doesn't care.
Not enough.

16:12.362 --> 16:16.018
Not while I'm useful,
and I will always be useful.

16:16.062 --> 16:18.847
So we're all right?

16:18.890 --> 16:21.284
If we weren't, we'd be dead.

16:21.328 --> 16:23.939
[scoffs]

16:26.942 --> 16:30.206
Octavia still wears black
for Marcellus... every day.

16:30.250 --> 16:31.425
We had no choice.

16:31.468 --> 16:35.037
I did.

16:44.177 --> 16:46.179
I'm going to need
your help today.

16:49.095 --> 16:51.053
The grain prefects, Dominus,

16:51.097 --> 16:53.925
Titus Cloelius Siculus
and Marcus Cassius Elva--

16:53.969 --> 16:55.188
I know who they are.

16:58.321 --> 17:00.062
[Titus] On behalf of the Senate

17:00.106 --> 17:04.458
and the people of Rome,
Augustus, welcome back.

17:04.501 --> 17:06.199
I trust we find you well

17:06.242 --> 17:10.333
after your long
and glorious voyage.

17:10.377 --> 17:13.902
The State, the City of Rome,

17:13.944 --> 17:17.645
all of it, everything, me,

17:17.688 --> 17:22.954
rests on
a single unspoken agreement.

17:22.998 --> 17:25.392
Half a million shit-poor Romans

17:25.435 --> 17:27.611
agree to let
a few hundred senators

17:27.655 --> 17:31.006
live in luxury
right in front of them. Why?

17:31.050 --> 17:33.095
Because, we agree
to give them

17:33.139 --> 17:37.186
the bread they need, free,

17:37.230 --> 17:39.928
every day of the year.

17:39.971 --> 17:43.975
and that is why
they don't tear us

17:44.019 --> 17:47.979
and our families
to fucking pieces

17:48.023 --> 17:50.243
in our beds.

17:50.286 --> 17:54.029
With respect, Augustus,

17:54.073 --> 17:57.032
the autumn storms
have never been this bad,

17:57.076 --> 17:58.468
and we can't control
the weather.

17:58.512 --> 18:01.080
The transports from Sicily
and Egypt are losing

18:01.123 --> 18:04.474
six out of seven ships.

18:04.518 --> 18:06.520
The warehouses
at Ostia are empty.

18:06.563 --> 18:09.218
As soon as anything
comes into the port,

18:09.262 --> 18:11.307
we bring it
straight up the river.

18:11.351 --> 18:14.005
It's the ship owners, Augustus.
They've let us down completely.

18:14.049 --> 18:15.616
[Gaius]
You're the grain prefect--

18:15.659 --> 18:17.966
an office I created
after the last famine

18:18.009 --> 18:21.187
to make sure
it never happens again.

18:21.230 --> 18:23.145
I appointed you both.

18:23.189 --> 18:25.452
I trusted you both.

18:25.495 --> 18:28.194
You've failed me.

18:28.237 --> 18:29.325
Get out.

18:40.206 --> 18:44.558
[Aratus] Drusus Nero,
Tiberius Nero, Iullus Antonius.

18:47.213 --> 18:49.998
Is it true the nightwatch sold
mother off in the slave market?

18:56.047 --> 18:58.137
Not a single fucking bid.

18:58.180 --> 18:59.486
[Drusus laughs]

18:59.529 --> 19:01.488
[Gaius]
I wish I'd been there.

19:01.531 --> 19:03.359
Where's Domitius?

19:03.403 --> 19:05.274
Out on Octavia's estate
with my sister,

19:05.318 --> 19:07.058
but I've sent for him.

19:07.102 --> 19:08.451
Any news of Agrippa?

19:08.495 --> 19:10.758
Due to leave Spain ten days ago,

19:10.801 --> 19:14.327
but the winds
have been against him.

19:14.370 --> 19:16.111
[Gaius] One of you should have
warned me about this famine.

19:16.155 --> 19:17.460
What could you have done?

19:17.504 --> 19:20.463
[Iullus]
We didn't want to worry you.

19:20.507 --> 19:23.074
And besides, the grain prefects
were constantly saying

19:23.118 --> 19:25.294
it was about to get better.

19:25.338 --> 19:27.427
Well, you three
are the new grain prefects.

19:30.430 --> 19:31.735
We're going
to the port at Ostia,

19:31.779 --> 19:33.259
having all the warehouses
searched.

19:33.302 --> 19:34.477
All of them?

19:34.521 --> 19:35.478
We'll find
the grain merchants there,

19:35.522 --> 19:36.740
see what they have to say.

19:36.784 --> 19:38.438
And, Tiberius,
assemble the Senate.

19:38.481 --> 19:39.743
Emergency session.

19:39.787 --> 19:41.092
There's hardly anyone here.

19:41.136 --> 19:42.659
They've all left Rome.

19:42.703 --> 19:44.139
You should keep
your doors locked.

19:46.620 --> 19:50.450
-[Drusus] Grain prefects, fuck.
-[horse whinnies]

19:50.493 --> 19:54.149
It shows he trusts us.
It's a chance to impress.

19:54.193 --> 19:56.412
No, it isn't. If it was
a chance to impress,

19:56.456 --> 19:57.587
fucking Domitius would be here.

19:57.631 --> 19:58.588
He's right.

19:58.632 --> 20:01.112
[Iullus]
Yes, he is.

20:01.156 --> 20:03.506
...two cohorts of Praetorians
into the city, my authority.

20:03.550 --> 20:05.769
Spread them
round the district. Go.

20:05.813 --> 20:07.249
[door opens]

20:07.293 --> 20:10.470
[panting, laughing]

20:10.513 --> 20:12.298
I didn't know
Octavia was in Rome.

20:12.341 --> 20:15.431
Yes, and someone's told her
about Gemina.

20:15.475 --> 20:17.607
If I were you,
I'd move her out of the house

20:17.651 --> 20:20.219
before Mother finds out.

20:20.262 --> 20:21.437
If I were you,
I'd be more worried about

20:21.481 --> 20:23.657
what Mother thinks
of your wife. [chuckles]

20:23.700 --> 20:26.703
Right. And that's why
you're Drusus.

20:26.747 --> 20:28.444
[horse whinnies]

20:30.272 --> 20:32.448
-[Tycho] If you could just...
-[Livia] Right.

20:33.493 --> 20:36.104
Octavia.

20:36.147 --> 20:38.106
Lady.

20:41.327 --> 20:44.243
I've chosen not to speak
to my brother about this,

20:44.286 --> 20:46.636
unless, of course,
it becomes necessary.

20:46.680 --> 20:49.770
Your son Drusus,

20:49.813 --> 20:52.816
he's openly living
with his German concubine

20:52.860 --> 20:56.646
in the house that he bought
next to mine.

20:56.690 --> 20:59.823
Now, of course,
if he were simply using a slave,

20:59.867 --> 21:02.173
one couldn't object.

21:02.217 --> 21:04.219
But he freed her recently.

21:04.263 --> 21:08.484
The girl now rides around
in a chair covered in jewelry,

21:08.528 --> 21:10.747
as if they were married.

21:10.791 --> 21:14.664
Drusus is engaged
to my daughter, Antonina.

21:14.708 --> 21:17.580
This behavior is offensive

21:17.624 --> 21:20.322
and disrespectful to our family.

21:20.366 --> 21:21.323
I will deal with it.

21:21.367 --> 21:22.716
[Octavia] Hmm.

21:25.240 --> 21:29.157
Unless, of course, you'd prefer
to cancel the betrothal?

21:37.208 --> 21:38.688
[Livia] Did you know
about Drusus?

21:38.732 --> 21:40.516
Ah, well...

21:40.560 --> 21:42.779
[Piso] Livia, I had
the watchmen flogged.

21:42.823 --> 21:45.304
-Here are your bracelets.
-Oh, thank you!

21:45.347 --> 21:47.567
[Piso] And, uh...

21:49.308 --> 21:52.354
Ursa.

21:52.398 --> 21:54.269
Where do you live?

21:54.313 --> 21:56.532
In the City of the Dead.

21:56.576 --> 21:58.795
There's an old tomb there
some of us sleep in.

21:58.839 --> 22:00.580
You told me
there's bread in Rome

22:00.623 --> 22:01.798
if you know where to look.

22:01.842 --> 22:03.365
Doyou know where to look?

22:03.409 --> 22:05.759
Do I get to go back
to my whorehouse after?

22:05.802 --> 22:07.717
No.

22:07.761 --> 22:11.286
Can I keep the dress?

22:13.332 --> 22:16.465
I see your thinking.

22:16.509 --> 22:17.901
If there's some bread
we don't know about...

22:17.945 --> 22:19.250
-[Ursa] Come on, this way!
-...there's some grain

22:19.294 --> 22:20.600
we don't know about.

22:20.643 --> 22:22.384
And if there's some grain
we don't know about,

22:22.428 --> 22:25.692
then what else
don't we know about?

22:25.735 --> 22:26.867
And why don't we know it?

22:26.910 --> 22:30.566
Here! This is where
Faustus lives.

22:30.610 --> 22:34.440
[door creaks]

22:39.575 --> 22:41.621
That's him! Faustus, there!

22:50.760 --> 22:52.240
[Tycho] Fuck!

23:02.816 --> 23:04.687
Prime Egyptian grain.

23:04.731 --> 23:06.515
[Piso]
Where is he getting it?

23:06.559 --> 23:09.953
[Livia] Get it handed out,
Tycho, and find Faustus, now.

23:09.997 --> 23:12.608
I'm sorry, I forget, you don't
work for me anymore. Sorry.

23:12.652 --> 23:13.783
No, I'd love to find him.

23:17.787 --> 23:20.486
Ursa?

23:20.529 --> 23:21.400
[sighs]

23:41.507 --> 23:42.986
Here he is, finally.

23:45.336 --> 23:46.860
[Domitius] We agreed,
we don't meet in public.

23:46.903 --> 23:49.036
It's an emergency.
Fucking Augustus is back!

23:49.079 --> 23:50.690
I know.

23:50.733 --> 23:52.605
The idea was to get out clean
before he came back.

23:52.648 --> 23:55.869
It was. That's right.

23:55.912 --> 23:57.610
We have to release the grain.

23:57.653 --> 23:58.828
-All of it, now.
-If we do that,

23:58.872 --> 24:00.308
the price will collapse

24:00.351 --> 24:01.657
and Augustus
will start asking questions.

24:01.701 --> 24:02.876
He's right.

24:02.919 --> 24:04.660
We'll bring in
more grain gradually

24:04.704 --> 24:07.576
until everything
goes back to normal.

24:07.620 --> 24:09.491
We just have to hold our nerve.

24:09.535 --> 24:10.753
[Titus]
It's all right for you.

24:10.797 --> 24:13.974
Augustus hates us now.
Our careers are over.

24:14.017 --> 24:16.585
You wanted the money.

24:16.629 --> 24:21.503
If I go down, I won't go alone.

24:27.857 --> 24:30.338
I'm losing confidence
in Siculus.

24:47.050 --> 24:48.530
[Livia] Vipsania.

24:48.574 --> 24:49.836
[Vipsania]
You've got a black eye.

24:49.879 --> 24:51.490
Where is she?

24:52.795 --> 24:55.581
[Gemina] Ow!

24:55.624 --> 24:57.539
Out. I'm sorry to interrupt
your waxing.

24:57.583 --> 24:59.019
[Gemina]
What are you doing?

24:59.062 --> 25:00.629
Who do you think you are?

25:00.673 --> 25:03.676
My son Drusus is engaged
to the niece of Augustus.

25:03.719 --> 25:05.460
Next year, they will marry.

25:05.504 --> 25:08.071
In the meantime, he cannot
live openly with a woman.

25:08.115 --> 25:10.726
I am the daughter of a king.

25:10.770 --> 25:11.945
Not anymore.

25:11.988 --> 25:13.555
And I don't take orders
from anyone.

25:13.599 --> 25:15.775
[Livia] You will take them
from me. Pack your things.

25:15.818 --> 25:17.603
You will live on my estate
outside of Rome

25:17.646 --> 25:19.474
until I find you a husband.

25:21.694 --> 25:22.956
I'm not leaving Drusus.

25:22.999 --> 25:24.523
[sighs]

25:26.786 --> 25:28.875
And I'm not leaving Rome.

25:30.964 --> 25:32.966
Drusus set me free.

25:33.009 --> 25:34.968
I can do what I want.

25:35.011 --> 25:39.799
And this is his house,
not yours. Old woman.

25:48.155 --> 25:50.461
Walk with me.

25:53.769 --> 25:55.771
As, uh, the wife of Tiberius,

25:55.815 --> 25:58.121
you will have
a high public profile.

25:58.165 --> 26:01.429
Yeah, I don't care
about any of that.

26:05.564 --> 26:08.131
Well, you will set an example
to the women of Rome

26:08.175 --> 26:11.134
by not snooping behind curtains

26:11.178 --> 26:14.616
and, of course, by supporting
your husband in his career.

26:14.660 --> 26:16.923
Tiberius isn't interested
in that.

26:16.966 --> 26:18.968
Neither am I.

26:19.012 --> 26:20.666
We can't wait to leave Rome.

26:20.709 --> 26:23.625
We're gonna build a big house
in the country

26:23.669 --> 26:25.975
without a road,
so no one else can find it.

26:26.019 --> 26:28.935
No, you're not.

26:28.978 --> 26:33.983
[under breath] You were always
a weird, little kid.

26:34.027 --> 26:37.813
I just went straight to her.
That's all I did. I didn't...

26:37.857 --> 26:40.816
Domitius, there you are!
We were worried about you.

26:43.166 --> 26:44.167
Will you send for Antonia,

26:44.211 --> 26:45.734
tell her
that her husband's here?

26:45.778 --> 26:47.170
[Marcella]
Guess what, Domitius.

26:47.214 --> 26:50.652
Uncle and Livia are back,
and Mother tore into her

26:50.696 --> 26:52.132
about Drusus
and his German slut.

26:52.175 --> 26:54.003
I did not!

26:54.047 --> 26:56.702
Oh, Antonia!
I did not tear into her.

26:56.745 --> 26:58.660
[Marcella]
I wish I'd been there.

26:58.704 --> 26:59.835
[Octavia]
Darling, do sit down.

26:59.879 --> 27:02.185
It's not the girl's fault,
any of it.

27:02.229 --> 27:04.623
I feel sorry for her.

27:04.666 --> 27:06.755
[Octavia] What about Antonina,
do you feel sorry for her?

27:06.799 --> 27:10.672
As her fiancé beasts himself
in front of everyone we know?

27:10.716 --> 27:13.544
I mean, really,
this perpetual niceness!

27:13.588 --> 27:14.676
I find it insufferable,

27:14.720 --> 27:15.851
and I don't know
where you get it from.

27:15.895 --> 27:18.114
Is Iullus here?
He sent me a note.

27:18.158 --> 27:19.550
[Marcella]
Iullus? [chuckles]

27:19.594 --> 27:21.030
Uncle made him a grain prefect,

27:21.074 --> 27:23.076
so, obviously,
the fun's as good as over.

27:23.119 --> 27:24.730
[laughs]

27:24.773 --> 27:26.253
Marcella, stop being so mean
about your poor husband.

27:26.296 --> 27:28.081
Marcella's mean about everyone.

27:29.822 --> 27:32.172
So Iullus is a prefect now.

27:32.215 --> 27:33.913
What else has happened?

27:45.664 --> 27:47.013
[Piso]
Did you find Faustus?

27:47.056 --> 27:48.797
No, he's gone to ground.

27:48.841 --> 27:51.800
-And the girl?
-[Tycho] No.

27:51.844 --> 27:54.063
[Piso]
It's your move, Livia.

27:54.107 --> 27:57.197
So, I went
to the public treasury

27:57.240 --> 27:59.721
and had a look
at the last census records.

27:59.765 --> 28:01.549
Faustus is listed at his address

28:01.592 --> 28:03.638
as a freed man
under his full name,

28:03.682 --> 28:05.727
Titus Cornelius Faustus,

28:05.771 --> 28:07.816
which as you know,
means he was once the slave

28:07.860 --> 28:10.906
of Titus Cornelius Siculus,

28:10.950 --> 28:12.603
the grain prefect.

28:16.956 --> 28:18.740
Fucking hell!

28:30.143 --> 28:33.059

-Augustus, welcome back.

28:33.102 --> 28:34.582
Domitius.

28:36.149 --> 28:38.760
Did you find anything?

28:38.804 --> 28:40.762
The warehouses
at the port were empty,

28:40.806 --> 28:44.331
and the merchants are blaming
the weather and each other.

28:44.374 --> 28:47.769
Piso! What are you
doing here?

28:47.813 --> 28:49.336
Ah, just trying
to stay relevant.

28:49.379 --> 28:50.772
[both chuckle]

28:50.816 --> 28:54.254
I've got a message
from your wife.

28:54.297 --> 28:58.693
At least one of the grain
prefects is corrupt.

28:58.737 --> 29:01.652
Siculus has been supplying
one of his ex-slaves with grain.

29:01.696 --> 29:03.654
Lots of grain.

29:03.698 --> 29:04.960
I can't believe it.

29:05.004 --> 29:06.266
So, what does that mean exactly?

29:06.309 --> 29:08.094
[Piso] Well, it means
there's grain here,

29:08.137 --> 29:09.791
and, if you know
where it is, it means

29:09.835 --> 29:12.794
the grain prefect
has been lying to Rome,

29:12.838 --> 29:15.797
and if he's lying to Rome
about that, what else is a lie?

29:15.841 --> 29:17.799
And if one of the prefects
is lying,

29:17.843 --> 29:19.366
how can we trust the other one?

29:19.409 --> 29:20.846
The price of grain
is astronomical.

29:20.889 --> 29:24.327
So we have to consider
the probability

29:24.371 --> 29:25.851
that this isn't a famine.

29:25.894 --> 29:27.330
It's a conspiracy.

29:27.374 --> 29:30.986
With your permission,
I'll have the prefects arrested.

29:31.030 --> 29:32.335
Alive.

29:32.379 --> 29:34.294
I need them alive,
especially Siculus.

29:34.337 --> 29:36.339
They're no good to me dead.

That fuck, Siculus,

[Iullus]
I searched his house,

39:53.913 --> 39:56.742
and I did leave guards there
in case he returns.

39:56.785 --> 40:00.920
I sent men to all the gates,
but he might have got out.

40:00.963 --> 40:02.704
Oh, he might have got out?

40:02.748 --> 40:05.272
Of course he fucking got out!
What the fuck?

-What was I supposed to do?
-You were supposed to find them,

40:07.840 --> 40:09.624

those fucking prefects,

40:09.668 --> 40:12.801

and no fucking grain!

who's behind it.

40:14.499 --> 40:16.936

in the next couple of days,

your fucking mouth shut

40:47.009 --> 40:49.490

40:49.534 --> 40:55.670
Without your marriage to me,

We know that harvests in Egypt
and Sicily were good.

41:14.646 --> 41:16.604
Good enough.

41:16.648 --> 41:19.868
Let's assume Elva and Siculus
and whoever else

41:19.912 --> 41:21.740
buy as much as they can
and then somehow

41:21.783 --> 41:22.871
stop it from coming to Rome.

41:22.915 --> 41:24.743
Well, the price shoots up.

41:24.786 --> 41:27.789
They feed it in slowly,
keeping the price high.

41:27.833 --> 41:30.662

in on that, the big ones anyway.
