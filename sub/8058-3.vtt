WEBVTT

00:01.095 --> 00:03.776
Okay, here's the text
I added a few more jokes,

00:03.896 --> 00:05.612
slamming Eagleton at the end.

00:05.614 --> 00:06.914
Mmm.
That's the sexiest thing

00:06.916 --> 00:08.248
you've ever said to me.

00:08.250 --> 00:09.782
I'm so glad you're on my team.

00:09.902 --> 00:11.035
Are you sure you wanna
attack 'em

00:11.037 --> 00:12.186
at this press conference?

00:12.188 --> 00:13.236
It's a friendly wager

00:13.238 --> 00:15.089
on a high school
basketball game.

00:15.091 --> 00:16.740
I'm losing
the recall election, Ben.

00:16.742 --> 00:18.008
Slamming Eagleton
is the easiest way

00:18.010 --> 00:19.276
to score some points.

00:19.278 --> 00:21.195
Look. Am I proud of it?
Yes.

00:21.197 --> 00:22.496
Because Eagleton sucks.

00:22.498 --> 00:23.881
But is it the classiest move?

00:23.883 --> 00:25.432
Yes, because Eagleton sucks.

00:25.434 --> 00:26.550
Would I do it again?

00:26.552 --> 00:28.202
Yes, because Eagleton sucks.

00:28.204 --> 00:29.403
This year, we get to host

00:29.405 --> 00:31.755
the Pawnee-Eagleton
tip-off classic.

00:31.757 --> 00:35.075
That awful human being
is Ingrid de Forest.

00:35.077 --> 00:37.027
She's a city councilor
from Eagleton.

00:37.029 --> 00:38.796
She thinks she's so great
because she won

00:38.798 --> 00:40.731
the Miss Indiana
Beauty Pageant.

00:40.733 --> 00:43.333
Last year.
While she was in office.

00:43.335 --> 00:45.002
And pregnant.

00:45.004 --> 00:46.453
As always,
we would like to make

00:46.455 --> 00:48.188
a friendly wager with Eagleton.

00:48.190 --> 00:49.757
If you beat us this year,

00:49.759 --> 00:51.925
we will give you
a basket of apples

00:51.927 --> 00:53.543
from our Pawnee orchard.

00:53.545 --> 00:55.079
Ew, pesticide.
Yuck.

00:55.081 --> 00:56.830
Oh, no, these
are pesticide-free.

00:56.832 --> 00:58.499
I ate one of these
for breakfast this morning,

00:58.501 --> 00:59.883
and I found a worm in it.

00:59.885 --> 01:03.353
So, I bet somebody feels
pretty stupid right now.

01:03.355 --> 01:06.407
Well, Leslie, I think
we had similar ideas.

01:06.409 --> 01:09.093
If you win,
Eagleton will give you

01:09.095 --> 01:10.811
this basket of oranges.

01:10.813 --> 01:11.895
[Chuckles]

01:11.897 --> 01:13.230
Of course,
it's silly to compare

01:13.232 --> 01:15.866
apples and oranges,
but what the heck.

01:15.868 --> 01:17.551
These are made
of Swarovski crystal,

01:17.553 --> 01:19.470
and they're worth $700,000.

01:19.472 --> 01:21.872
Leslie, you're down 15 points

01:21.874 --> 01:23.791
in the latest poll
for the recall election.

01:23.793 --> 01:25.676
What can you do
to make up the deficit?

01:25.678 --> 01:27.428
I'll tell you what I'd do
if I was an Eagletonian.

01:27.430 --> 01:28.912
I'd pop a Xanax

01:28.914 --> 01:30.664
and ask my butler
to help me out.

01:30.666 --> 01:33.183
[Laughter]

01:33.185 --> 01:34.718
I mean, I'm not saying
that Eagletonians

01:34.720 --> 01:35.819
are out of touch.

01:35.821 --> 01:37.404
But when you tell 'em it's time

01:37.406 --> 01:38.839
to change their oil, they ask,

01:38.841 --> 01:40.891
"Extra virgin
or white truffle?"

01:40.893 --> 01:42.059
[Laughter]

01:42.061 --> 01:43.610
Thanks, guys.
I'll see ya at the game.

01:43.612 --> 01:45.079
Unless, of course,
you're an Eagletonian,

01:45.081 --> 01:46.747
and then you'll be too busy
polishing your monocle

01:46.749 --> 01:48.365
at the caviar store.

01:48.367 --> 01:50.050
Knope out.
[Microphone feedback]

01:50.052 --> 01:51.101
[Laughter]

01:51.103 --> 01:52.186
Yeah.

01:52.188 --> 01:55.172

02:12.474 --> 02:15.158
Who or what is <i>Penny Saver?</i>

02:15.160 --> 02:17.611
It's a free circular
with a bunch of coupons in it.

02:17.613 --> 02:19.746
This was sent to Ron Swanson

02:19.748 --> 02:21.131
at Diane's address,

02:21.133 --> 02:23.600
where I've lived
for less than a month.

02:23.602 --> 02:25.269
How is that possible?

02:25.271 --> 02:27.771
This is an extreme invasion
of privacy.

02:27.773 --> 02:30.641
The right to privacy
is very important to me.

02:30.643 --> 02:33.110
My family has had
a single P.O. box

02:33.112 --> 02:34.795
for several generations.

02:34.797 --> 02:37.264
We only ever subscribe
to two magazines,

02:37.266 --> 02:39.900
<i>Reader's Digest</i> and <i>Ebony.</i>

02:39.902 --> 02:41.818
<i>Ebony</i> was due
to a clerical error,

02:41.820 --> 02:45.105
but it ended up being
an interesting year of reading.

02:45.107 --> 02:46.556
I don't know how this
was delivered to me,

02:46.558 --> 02:48.408
but it cannot happen again.

02:48.410 --> 02:49.710
How can I stop it?

02:49.712 --> 02:52.146
Mm. Donna is great
with this sort of thing.

02:52.148 --> 02:54.248
She got me off the
Williams-Sonoma mailing list,

02:54.250 --> 02:55.899
but then I just
signed back up again.

02:55.901 --> 02:57.084
Hooked on their oven mitts.

02:57.086 --> 02:58.535
I need my mitts on those mitts.

02:58.537 --> 03:00.187
Let me know the second
Donna returns.

03:00.189 --> 03:01.471
According to her Twitter feed,

03:01.473 --> 03:03.240
she got coffee
five minutes ago.

03:03.242 --> 03:05.092
Wait, now she's Ustreaming
her walk back.

03:05.094 --> 03:09.730
She should be here
in three, two, one.

03:09.732 --> 03:11.331
Both: Hey, hey.

03:11.333 --> 03:14.434
Hashtag quest for coffee,
blowin' up my timeline.

03:14.436 --> 03:15.903
You get my snapchat about it?

03:15.905 --> 03:17.905
- No.
- What?

03:17.907 --> 03:20.174
There it is.

03:21.559 --> 03:22.926
- Hey, you wanted to see me?
- I did.

03:22.928 --> 03:24.778
- Think fast.
- Oh, my God.

03:24.780 --> 03:27.063
Hey, Dr. Buttons--

03:27.065 --> 03:28.849
I mean, my old calculator.

03:28.851 --> 03:30.000
It doesn't have a name.

03:30.002 --> 03:31.185
Why did you throw this at me?

03:31.187 --> 03:32.319
I just got off the phone
with our old boss

03:32.321 --> 03:33.470
from Indianapolis,

03:33.472 --> 03:34.721
and apparently there may be
some sort of

03:34.723 --> 03:36.590
a budget problem in Eagleton.

03:36.592 --> 03:39.092
He asked if maybe you and I

03:39.094 --> 03:42.329
wouldn't have a look.
You in?

03:42.331 --> 03:44.715
Butch Count-sidy
and the Sum-dance Kid,

03:44.717 --> 03:46.683
together again.

03:49.270 --> 03:51.672
Both: Hmm.
- Auditing bros!

03:51.674 --> 03:55.425
Yeah, and auditing sistah.
Let's do this.

03:55.427 --> 03:56.577
Oh, you're coming?

03:56.579 --> 03:57.778
If there's a problem
with Eagleton,

03:57.780 --> 03:58.829
I wanna be there.

03:58.831 --> 04:00.130
That's like a dream come true.

04:00.132 --> 04:02.466
Besides, I have a new routine
I'm working on.

04:02.468 --> 04:04.067
Kind of like
a Jeff Foxworthy-type thing,

04:04.069 --> 04:05.285
but about Eagleton.

04:05.287 --> 04:06.536
[Southern accent]
If you make your omelet

04:06.538 --> 04:08.922
out of Faberge eggs,

04:08.924 --> 04:11.725
you just might...
Both: Be an Eagletonian.

04:11.727 --> 04:13.977
Yippee! Road trip!

04:13.979 --> 04:15.545
Who's excited to go
to Bloomington?

04:15.547 --> 04:16.930
Is that where you're gonna sit?

04:16.932 --> 04:18.982
I'm driving.
Where else would I sit?

04:18.983 --> 04:20.382
Trunk.

04:20.385 --> 04:22.019
I helped April get
into vet school in Bloomington

04:22.021 --> 04:23.320
and today's her orientation,

04:23.322 --> 04:25.205
so we're taking
a little road trip.

04:25.207 --> 04:26.640
While I'm there,
I'm also gonna pick up

04:26.642 --> 04:28.124
an organic baby blanket.

04:28.126 --> 04:30.110
I would get one in Pawnee,
but fun fact--

04:30.112 --> 04:33.630
our only baby store is attached
to a chemical refinery.

04:33.632 --> 04:36.717
I made a special road trip
mix CD for us.

04:36.719 --> 04:39.720
- I hope you like Tori Amos.
- Oh, cool.

04:42.824 --> 04:45.242
It really is a pleasure
to see you

04:45.244 --> 04:46.510
in this context, Ingrid.

04:46.512 --> 04:47.561
Say cheese.

04:47.563 --> 04:49.746
Damn it.
You look beautiful.

04:49.748 --> 04:51.581
Can you give us
a little more information

04:51.583 --> 04:53.300
surrounding the deficits
that you're running this year?

04:53.302 --> 04:54.635
Ooh, gosh.

04:54.637 --> 04:57.254
We don't really like
to talk about

04:57.256 --> 04:58.405
[whispers]
money.

04:58.407 --> 05:00.073
We find a little gauche.

05:00.075 --> 05:01.742
This is a budget meeting.

05:01.744 --> 05:03.427
Well, most of our files
are in these boxes

05:03.429 --> 05:04.478
if you really wanna take a look

05:04.480 --> 05:06.396
at how much that we've spent.

05:06.398 --> 05:07.397
Why don't we just dig in

05:07.399 --> 05:08.482
and see what we're up against?

05:08.484 --> 05:09.950
Yes. And thank you.

05:09.952 --> 05:12.602
We really appreciate your help.

05:12.604 --> 05:14.554
Are you tipping me?

05:14.556 --> 05:17.541
Is that 100...Euros?

05:17.543 --> 05:20.443
People ought to have
the right to be left alone.

05:20.445 --> 05:22.813
I wanna get completely
off the grid.

05:22.815 --> 05:24.064
That's crazy talk.

05:24.066 --> 05:25.382
I live for the grid.

05:25.384 --> 05:27.651
It's where I meet
40% of my jump-offs.

05:27.653 --> 05:28.835
And if you're off the grid,

05:28.837 --> 05:29.986
how are you gonna post photos

05:29.988 --> 05:31.421
of the dope food
at restaurants you're at

05:31.423 --> 05:33.056
and all the cool places
you're stuntin' in?

05:33.058 --> 05:34.141
Food is for eating.

05:34.143 --> 05:36.693
Places are for being.
End of discussion.

05:36.695 --> 05:38.245
Don't leave the grid, Ron.
The grid is the best.

05:38.247 --> 05:40.714
If anything, you need
to get more on the grid.

05:40.716 --> 05:43.550
Both: Grid, grid, grid,
grid, grid, grid, grid--

05:43.552 --> 05:44.768
If you help me
get off the grid,

05:44.770 --> 05:46.720
I will let both of you
go home early.

05:46.722 --> 05:50.957
Both: No grid, no grid,
no grid, no grid.

05:50.959 --> 05:52.125
All right, so you have

05:52.127 --> 05:53.493
everything you need
for orientation?

05:53.495 --> 05:55.645
Yeah, an empty Sprite can,

05:55.647 --> 05:58.015
an old man's fingernail
in my pocket,

05:58.017 --> 06:00.434
and a picture of Patrick Ewing

06:00.436 --> 06:01.451
on a roller coaster.

06:01.453 --> 06:02.919
- I'm all set.
- Great.

06:02.921 --> 06:05.155
Hi. My friend here
is enrolling

06:05.157 --> 06:06.423
in the vet school next month,

06:06.425 --> 06:08.175
and she would like
to be shown around.

06:08.177 --> 06:10.126
Totally, happy to.
I'm Laura.

06:10.128 --> 06:12.279
I'm April Ludgate Kevorkian.

06:12.281 --> 06:14.031
So you go with Laura,
who seems really nice

06:14.033 --> 06:15.949
and does not deserve
to be tortured.

06:15.951 --> 06:17.334
And I will come
meet up with you

06:17.336 --> 06:19.102
after I finish
at the baby store.

06:19.104 --> 06:20.687
Sure you wanna
leave me here with her?

06:20.689 --> 06:22.105
What if I'm a murderer?

06:22.107 --> 06:24.507
[Laughs]
Oh, that's funny.

06:24.509 --> 06:26.910
This is worse
than I could've imagined.

06:26.912 --> 06:29.112
Their debt-to-equity ratio
is ridonkulous.

06:29.114 --> 06:31.131
[Laughs]
What a hilarious word.

06:31.133 --> 06:32.916
It reminds me
of a ridiculous donkey.

06:32.918 --> 06:34.000
He's the best.

06:34.002 --> 06:35.268
What does this mean for them?

06:35.270 --> 06:36.686
They were in financial trouble

06:36.688 --> 06:38.805
a few years ago,
like Pawnee was,

06:38.807 --> 06:42.225
but their government
just kept borrowing money.

06:42.227 --> 06:43.560
Eagleton is on the brink

06:43.562 --> 06:45.695
of an epic financial disaster.

06:45.697 --> 06:46.947
Ahh.

06:48.900 --> 06:50.650
Now that is the sexiest thing
you've ever said to me.

06:50.652 --> 06:51.785
Really, that?

06:51.787 --> 06:53.987
This is gonna hand me
the recall election.

06:53.989 --> 06:55.705
I saved Pawnee from bankruptcy.

06:55.707 --> 06:57.908
Now I get to remind people
of that fact

06:57.910 --> 06:59.493
as we watch our worst enemy

06:59.495 --> 07:01.461
collapse into bankruptcy.

07:01.463 --> 07:03.663
Plus, guess what I get
to do after the game now.

07:03.665 --> 07:04.798
You pretend you're Ingrid.

07:04.800 --> 07:05.949
Let's pretend this box

07:05.951 --> 07:07.634
is the basket of apples
I bet them on the game.

07:07.636 --> 07:09.002
I see where
you're going with this.

07:09.004 --> 07:10.286
- No, you don't.
- Yeah, you're gonna ask me

07:10.288 --> 07:11.755
- if I like apples--
- Do you like apples?

07:11.757 --> 07:13.473
We just watched this movie
two nights ago, so--

07:13.475 --> 07:14.641
- Do you like apples?
- I don't wanna do this.

07:14.643 --> 07:16.760
How about them apples?
[Laughs]

07:19.148 --> 07:21.229
Paul, if you ever see
another one of these

07:21.349 --> 07:21.865
with my name on it,

07:21.909 --> 07:23.907
I want you to drive
into the woods and bury it.

07:24.027 --> 07:25.660
I don't decide
who gets mail, sir.

07:25.662 --> 07:26.778
I just deliver it.

07:26.780 --> 07:28.213
Passing the buck--

07:28.215 --> 07:30.932
the last refuge of the cowardly
and black-hearted.

07:30.934 --> 07:33.452
- That seems harsh.
- Get out.

07:33.454 --> 07:35.187
We got rid of your cell phone.

07:35.189 --> 07:37.689
This is your last credit card.

07:37.691 --> 07:39.825
Are you sure you want me
to cut up this card?

07:39.827 --> 07:41.510
It gets you into
the parking garage.

07:41.512 --> 07:42.811
I'll be taking the bus now,

07:42.813 --> 07:44.646
and I'll be paying in cash.

07:44.648 --> 07:47.299
What other traces of me
exist in the world?

07:47.301 --> 07:48.633
Think, people.

07:48.635 --> 07:50.385
Isn't there a photo of you
up at JJ's Diner,

07:50.387 --> 07:51.903
from that time when you--
aah!

07:51.905 --> 07:53.238
Come on, Tom!

07:53.240 --> 07:55.290
This place is unbelievable.

07:55.292 --> 07:57.225
It has everything I need:

07:57.227 --> 07:59.945
Video monitors,
lead-free pacifiers.

07:59.947 --> 08:01.630
These are the first bibs
I've ever seen

08:01.632 --> 08:04.015
without Dale Earnhardt Jr.'s
face on them.

08:04.017 --> 08:06.034
Really?

08:06.036 --> 08:07.586
April?

08:07.588 --> 08:08.920
Excuse me, sorry.

08:08.922 --> 08:11.189
April, why aren't you
at orientation?

08:11.191 --> 08:12.407
Um, I was at orientation,

08:12.409 --> 08:13.825
but it was lame, so I left.

08:13.827 --> 08:16.377
And then I kept walking,
and now here I am.

08:16.379 --> 08:18.079
We are going back there
right now, young lady.

08:18.081 --> 08:20.081
- Mm-mm.
- Come on.

08:20.083 --> 08:21.867
God, get off me, stranger.

08:21.869 --> 08:23.602
I'm so sorry we're late.

08:23.604 --> 08:25.070
We came from
our bankruptcy brunch.

08:25.072 --> 08:27.789
And Michael Buble played,
but he ran a little long.

08:27.791 --> 08:28.990
I love Michael Buble.

08:28.992 --> 08:31.226
Was a bankruptcy brunch
the best idea?

08:31.228 --> 08:32.277
Sure, let's not have brunch...

08:32.279 --> 08:33.812
[Chuckles]
like animals.

08:33.813 --> 08:35.996
Well, um, some of
these expenditures

08:35.999 --> 08:37.782
are questionable.

08:37.784 --> 08:40.835
Uh, you filled the public pools
with bottled water?

08:40.837 --> 08:42.287
Total body hydration.

08:42.289 --> 08:43.421
What is this here?

08:43.423 --> 08:45.891
This massive expenditure
from public works?

08:45.893 --> 08:47.943
Ah, yes. Well, yes.

08:47.945 --> 08:50.712
We purchased HBO
for the whole town.

08:50.714 --> 08:52.514
I'm sorry.
You spent government money

08:52.516 --> 08:54.266
on a TV subscription?

08:54.268 --> 08:56.368
It's not TV.

08:56.370 --> 08:58.336
Al right.
Uh, Leslie's put together

08:58.338 --> 09:00.555
a presentation
for a financial recovery.

09:00.557 --> 09:01.589
Great.

09:01.591 --> 09:02.741
You may find it
very informative.

09:02.743 --> 09:04.743
Let's get started
with our first slide.

09:04.745 --> 09:07.629
"Well, well, well..."

09:07.631 --> 09:09.130
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

09:10.432 --> 09:13.401
JJ, a few months ago,
I came in here

09:13.403 --> 09:14.953
and began eating eggs.

09:14.955 --> 09:16.855
They were delicious,
so I ordered more.

09:16.857 --> 09:18.807
Before long,
I believe I had eaten--

09:18.809 --> 09:20.775
51 eggs in 20 minutes.

09:20.777 --> 09:22.076
Couldn't cook 'em fast enough.

09:22.078 --> 09:23.962
The last ten were still
in the shell.

09:23.964 --> 09:26.848
It was a JJ's Diner record,
and you took his picture.

09:26.850 --> 09:29.834
Now, we need that picture,
for privacy reasons.

09:29.836 --> 09:31.119
Okay, but I don't know

09:31.121 --> 09:33.221
how anybody
would know it's you.

09:33.223 --> 09:36.658
We followed your instructions.

09:36.660 --> 09:39.678
That's too much information.

09:39.680 --> 09:40.879
Let's go.

09:40.881 --> 09:42.163
Where are we going now?

09:42.165 --> 09:45.500
I've eaten a lot of food
in a lot of restaurants.

09:45.502 --> 09:49.220
Why is everyone else
so bad at eating?

09:49.222 --> 09:50.722
I only agreed to come back here

09:50.724 --> 09:51.806
because of our deal.

09:51.808 --> 09:53.041
Do you promise to play along?

09:53.043 --> 09:53.992
- Yes.
- Do you?

09:53.994 --> 09:56.077
- Yes.
- Hi, you're back.

09:56.079 --> 09:57.578
Hello again.

09:57.580 --> 09:58.846
As you remember, I'm April,

09:58.848 --> 10:01.683
and this is Ann,
my 65-year-old grandmother.

10:01.685 --> 10:04.085
Yes, that's who I am.
Anyway,

10:04.087 --> 10:05.353
we'd love to
hear about Bloomington.

10:05.355 --> 10:07.922
It seems like a real hip
kind of college town.

10:07.924 --> 10:11.126
Mee-maw, God, no one uses
the word hip anymore.

10:11.128 --> 10:12.978
Sometimes I wish you
went down on the <i>Titanic</i>

10:12.980 --> 10:14.679
with all your sorority sisters.

10:14.681 --> 10:15.780
I would be happy
to show you guys

10:15.782 --> 10:17.065
around the campus.

10:17.067 --> 10:19.000
Is there anything in particular
that you wanna see?

10:19.002 --> 10:20.868
How are your local graveyards?

10:20.870 --> 10:23.905
[Whispers]
I have some planning to do.

10:23.907 --> 10:25.306
"You blew it.

10:25.308 --> 10:26.574
"Super hard.

10:26.576 --> 10:28.343
"Complete buffoonery.

10:28.345 --> 10:29.928
It's hilarious."

10:29.930 --> 10:31.045
And "You deserve it."

10:31.047 --> 10:32.263
Hey, you think you might wanna

10:32.265 --> 10:33.398
take it easy on them
a little bit?

10:33.400 --> 10:35.283
Oh, like they
took it easy on us

10:35.285 --> 10:36.551
when they stole all our money

10:36.553 --> 10:37.886
and seceded from our town?

10:37.888 --> 10:40.138
That was 200 years ago.
Cool it.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.823
Fine. I'll skip ahead.

10:41.825 --> 10:43.991
Do you have a plan
that will help us or not?

10:43.993 --> 10:45.627
We have borrowed absolutely

10:45.629 --> 10:46.761
everything we can
from the state.

10:46.763 --> 10:49.664
And really,
Pawnee is our only hope.

10:49.666 --> 10:50.949
We do have a plan.

10:50.951 --> 10:55.253
We are willing to provide
a bridge loan for $50,000.

10:55.255 --> 10:57.772
25% interest
compounded monthly.

10:57.774 --> 10:59.491
And you need to release
a statement that says

10:59.493 --> 11:01.292
that Pawnee rules
and Eagleton drools.

11:01.294 --> 11:03.061
Well, now you're just
being nasty.

11:03.063 --> 11:05.730
I understand that our towns
have a complicated history,

11:05.732 --> 11:08.583
but we have
a saying in Eagleton...

11:08.585 --> 11:10.719
"You don't kick
a dressage horse

11:10.721 --> 11:12.504
after a failed
<i>pas de deux."</i>

11:12.506 --> 11:13.738
Whatever, blondie.

11:13.740 --> 11:15.874
Your butler made your bed,
now you gotta lie in it.

11:15.876 --> 11:17.092
And if you walk out that door,

11:17.094 --> 11:19.678
none of us here,
and I repeat, none of us

11:19.680 --> 11:21.196
will ever help you again.

11:21.198 --> 11:22.497
Oh, my God.

11:22.499 --> 11:25.050
They have Michael Buble
on retainer.

11:25.052 --> 11:27.502
Okay, all public photos
of me recovered.

11:27.504 --> 11:30.205
Nameplate removed
from my office door.

11:30.207 --> 11:34.726
Pediatrician files confiscated
and destroyed.

11:34.728 --> 11:36.528
- Anything I'm missing?
- Great news, Ron.

11:36.530 --> 11:38.096
Jean-Ralphio
loves your shirt.

11:38.098 --> 11:39.881
What the hell
are you talking about?

11:39.883 --> 11:41.182
Oh, I've been taking pictures
of you all day

11:41.184 --> 11:42.350
for my new Facebook album:

11:42.352 --> 11:45.737
"Ronswan: Gettin' off the grid."

11:45.739 --> 11:48.322
Tom, do you maybe see a problem

11:48.324 --> 11:52.460
with what you've done?

11:52.462 --> 11:55.747
I do now.
Yes, sorry.

11:55.749 --> 11:58.083
Erase.

11:58.085 --> 12:00.351
Erase. Erase.

12:00.353 --> 12:02.904
Erase all pictures of Ron!

12:02.906 --> 12:05.824
Erase all pictures of Ron!

12:05.826 --> 12:08.426
Erase all pictures of Ron!

12:08.428 --> 12:10.178
What the hell is happening?

12:10.180 --> 12:12.147
I think you accidentally
opened up vine.

12:12.149 --> 12:14.115
You just vined
your first selfie, Ron.

12:14.117 --> 12:16.067
And I'm vining you
vine your selfie.

12:16.069 --> 12:19.337
The world is a nightmare.

12:19.339 --> 12:21.422
[Both laughing]

12:21.424 --> 12:22.607
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

12:22.609 --> 12:24.943
Erase all pictures of Ron!

12:24.945 --> 12:27.028
All: Erase all pictures
of Ron!

12:27.030 --> 12:28.079
[Laughs]

12:28.081 --> 12:29.898
The B-line
is a cool outdoor trail

12:29.900 --> 12:31.900
that cuts
right through downtown.

12:31.902 --> 12:34.435
She said the B-line
is cool, Mee-maw.

12:34.437 --> 12:35.987
Cool means good.

12:35.989 --> 12:38.206
Thank you, Laura,
for showing us around.

12:38.208 --> 12:39.207
Sure.

12:39.209 --> 12:41.776
See you
in a couple weeks, April.

12:41.778 --> 12:43.862
See?
This place is great.

12:43.864 --> 12:45.580
Aren't you glad we came back
and talked to her?

12:45.582 --> 12:47.048
No. It was pointless.

12:47.050 --> 12:48.550
I'm not going to school here.

12:48.552 --> 12:50.251
April, don't flake out on this.

12:50.253 --> 12:52.187
You're gonna love it here.
Bloomington is great.

12:52.189 --> 12:55.790
It's got culture and music
and tons of youngsters.

12:55.792 --> 12:59.144
Youngsters?
Am I 65 years old?

12:59.146 --> 13:01.362
Yeah, I'm not going here.
I don't want to.

13:01.364 --> 13:02.781
Let's leave.

13:05.601 --> 13:07.519
- Think fast.
- Oh!

13:07.521 --> 13:11.105
Why do people keep assuming
I'm ready to catch things?

13:11.107 --> 13:13.575
"Eagleton:
No money, mo' problems."

13:13.577 --> 13:14.759
Fantastic, right?

13:14.761 --> 13:16.010
I made enough of them
for everybody

13:16.012 --> 13:17.044
to wear at the game.

13:17.046 --> 13:18.596
I do like
a good internal rhyme.

13:18.598 --> 13:19.781
Ben, you ready for dinner?

13:19.783 --> 13:21.032
We can go over
the poll numbers.

13:21.034 --> 13:23.117
Oh...you know,

13:23.119 --> 13:24.786
I've got a few phone calls
to make.

13:24.788 --> 13:26.421
Can you give me an hour?

13:26.423 --> 13:27.972
I can meet you there.

13:27.974 --> 13:30.191
Oh, my God.

13:30.193 --> 13:32.443
- What is she doing here?
- I'm sorry, Leslie,

13:32.445 --> 13:34.329
but you didn't really
help them very much,

13:34.331 --> 13:35.580
so we volunteered to give them

13:35.582 --> 13:37.248
a little financial advice.

13:37.250 --> 13:38.833
You didn't actually
help us at all.

13:38.835 --> 13:41.669
- Just one second.
- Yeah.

13:41.671 --> 13:43.838
I'm just gonna
help them out, okay?

13:43.840 --> 13:45.773
- Mm.
- Just for an hour.

13:45.775 --> 13:47.308
He's just being
a good neighbor.

13:47.310 --> 13:48.993
We're in a lot of trouble,
Leslie.

13:48.995 --> 13:50.328
I don't need
any lip from you, okay?

13:50.330 --> 13:51.946
You're in trouble because
of your own stupidity.

13:51.948 --> 13:54.716
[Scoffs] I have a PhD
from the Sorbonne.

13:54.718 --> 13:56.835
For what?
Wearing Chanel suits?

13:56.837 --> 13:59.220
There was
a fashion component, yes.

13:59.222 --> 14:00.755
I'm not mad
that you're doing this.

14:00.757 --> 14:02.456
Yes, I am mad
that you're doing this.

14:02.458 --> 14:03.675
But even worse,
I'm mad that you just

14:03.677 --> 14:05.009
- lied to me about it.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

14:05.011 --> 14:06.294
We all swore
that we weren't gonna

14:06.296 --> 14:07.929
ever help her again, ever.

14:07.931 --> 14:09.480
I never said that.
You did.

14:09.482 --> 14:11.349
I speak for all of us
in all matters.

14:11.351 --> 14:13.101
That is what you
tacitly agreed to

14:13.103 --> 14:14.263
- when you married me.
- What?

14:14.286 --> 14:16.195
Yeah, let's go.
You've changed your mind.

14:16.315 --> 14:17.481
You're not gonna
help her anymore.

14:17.483 --> 14:18.482
Leslie, I just wanna

14:18.484 --> 14:19.915
borrow your husband
for the evening.

14:24.225 --> 14:26.185
Can we please talk about what happened
back there?

14:26.268 --> 14:28.453
What, Ann? I just stole your phone

14:28.573 --> 14:30.968
and texted every guy
in it that the baby was theirs.

14:31.088 --> 14:32.209
It's not that big of a deal.

14:32.276 --> 14:33.742
Listen, I know
you don't believe this,

14:33.744 --> 14:35.878
but I care about your future.

14:35.880 --> 14:37.947
And I'm just
a little disappointed

14:37.949 --> 14:39.882
that you're just not
following through with this.

14:39.884 --> 14:42.466
Yeah, it's not about
following through, okay?

14:42.495 --> 14:44.462
I was on the fence about
whether I wanted to do it.

14:44.464 --> 14:48.066
And as soon as I got there,
I just had a gut feeling

14:48.068 --> 14:50.035
that it wasn't right for me,
that's all.

14:50.037 --> 14:52.838
So, just like that,
boom--huge life decision made?

14:52.840 --> 14:54.623
That's how I make
all my life decisions.

14:54.625 --> 14:56.825
My gut is always right, okay?

14:56.827 --> 14:58.660
It was right about
marrying Andy,

14:58.662 --> 14:59.845
and it was right
when it told me

14:59.847 --> 15:00.979
that you would be
the worst person

15:00.981 --> 15:02.480
I would ever meet in my life.

15:02.482 --> 15:04.332
And I've met Guy Fieri, Ann.

15:04.334 --> 15:05.417
[Chuckles]

15:05.419 --> 15:07.302
<i>So</i> gross!

15:07.304 --> 15:09.104
How do you get your gut
to talk to you?

15:09.106 --> 15:10.739
You don't get your gut
to talk to you.

15:10.741 --> 15:13.008
You just listen
when it says something.

15:13.010 --> 15:15.810
Well, right now
my gut is saying

15:15.812 --> 15:17.696
that we are going to listen
to Mariah Carey

15:17.698 --> 15:19.247
the whole way home.

15:19.249 --> 15:20.832
[Vocalizing over radio]

15:20.834 --> 15:23.602
- Good.
- [Ann vocalizing]

15:23.604 --> 15:25.954
[Whistle blows]

15:30.059 --> 15:31.860
[Cheers and applause]

15:33.112 --> 15:35.213
Whoa.
Wow, I'm really surprised

15:35.215 --> 15:37.015
you're sitting on this side
of the bleachers

15:37.017 --> 15:39.234
and not on the Eagleton side
with your new girlfriend Ingrid.

15:39.236 --> 15:41.570
Leslie, I'm just
trying to help them.

15:41.572 --> 15:43.421
Why?
They wouldn't help us

15:43.423 --> 15:44.422
if the tables were turned.

15:44.424 --> 15:46.141
I mean,
they're 50 points ahead,

15:46.143 --> 15:47.659
and they're still dunking.

15:47.661 --> 15:49.227
I mean, look at this guy.

15:49.229 --> 15:52.297
There's no way
he is in high school.

15:52.299 --> 15:54.966
And I'm better
at French horn too, Eric.

15:54.968 --> 15:56.067
[Whistle blows]

15:56.069 --> 15:58.436
[Crowd booing]

15:58.438 --> 16:00.405
People are gonna
lose their jobs, Leslie.

16:00.407 --> 16:02.507
And the recovery
will take years.

16:02.509 --> 16:06.027
Deep down, I think
you feel bad for them.

16:06.029 --> 16:08.530
Okay, I do a little, yes.

16:08.532 --> 16:11.516
And I'm sorry that I blew up
at you yesterday.

16:11.518 --> 16:13.151
With all the recall stuff
happening,

16:13.153 --> 16:15.987
I just really need to feel
like you're on my team,

16:15.989 --> 16:18.323
and seeing you with them

16:18.325 --> 16:20.258
made me feel like you weren't.

16:20.260 --> 16:22.010
I'm always gonna be
on your team.

16:22.012 --> 16:24.362
You never have to worry
about that.

16:24.364 --> 16:26.631
[Crowd chanting]
Defense!

16:26.633 --> 16:28.883
All: Oh!

16:28.885 --> 16:32.370
Eagleton player number seven,
injured on the play.

16:32.372 --> 16:33.822
Official time-out.

16:33.824 --> 16:35.674
Oh, God.

16:35.676 --> 16:37.058
I'm gonna say something.

16:37.060 --> 16:39.310
And if I throw up on you
after I say it,

16:39.312 --> 16:40.912
just know that
you've been warned.

16:40.914 --> 16:44.783
I know how we can
help Eagleton.

16:44.785 --> 16:46.401
I don't see
what the problem is.

16:46.403 --> 16:48.370
I will give you
a certain amount of gold

16:48.372 --> 16:50.822
in exchange for
a recreational vehicle.

16:50.824 --> 16:53.091
I still need an address
for insurance purposes.

16:53.093 --> 16:54.926
This will be my new home.

16:54.928 --> 16:59.397
The address is wherever
it is parked.

16:59.399 --> 17:00.849
Where have you been?

17:00.851 --> 17:02.467
I had a flat tire,
and I've been trying

17:02.469 --> 17:04.102
to get in touch with you
for hours.

17:04.104 --> 17:05.487
Sorry, darling.

17:05.489 --> 17:08.106
I've been busy destroying
most of my personal effects

17:08.108 --> 17:10.458
and threatening
a postal worker.

17:10.460 --> 17:12.560
Ron, I know you value
your privacy,

17:12.561 --> 17:14.546
but you are a husband
and a father now.

17:14.548 --> 17:16.247
You can't just
roam the streets in an RV

17:16.249 --> 17:18.648
and be impossible to find.

17:18.651 --> 17:20.451
I'm on a mission
to get off the grid.

17:20.453 --> 17:22.103
Well, you don't have to be
entirely on the grid,

17:22.105 --> 17:23.921
but have to be on our grid.

17:23.923 --> 17:27.959
I suppose you wouldn't
consider moving.

17:27.961 --> 17:30.011
I've heard the school system
in the tunnels

17:30.013 --> 17:32.864
beneath Yucca Mountain
is adequate.

17:32.866 --> 17:34.616
I love you, but your solution
to every problem

17:34.618 --> 17:36.100
is to live inside a mountain.

17:36.102 --> 17:39.120
I love you too.

17:39.122 --> 17:41.039
Okay, one more time.

17:41.041 --> 17:42.223
Are you absolutely sure

17:42.225 --> 17:43.558
you wanna go through with this?

17:43.560 --> 17:45.210
A lot of people
are gonna get angry,

17:45.212 --> 17:47.962
and you might lose
the recall election.

17:47.964 --> 17:50.882
Or, if I pull it off,
I just might win.

17:50.884 --> 17:53.084
Plus, a very smart member
of my team

17:53.086 --> 17:55.253
pointed out
it's the right thing to do.

17:55.255 --> 17:56.721
Good morning.

17:56.723 --> 17:58.189
After an all-night
strategy session,

17:58.191 --> 18:00.492
the towns of Pawnee
and Eagleton

18:00.494 --> 18:02.377
have come up
with a potential solution

18:02.379 --> 18:04.796
to Eagleton's budget crisis.

18:04.798 --> 18:06.715
The town of Eagleton
will be dissolved

18:06.717 --> 18:09.284
and re-absorbed
into Pawnee.

18:09.286 --> 18:11.269
[Exclamations]

18:11.271 --> 18:12.921
Pawnee will provide
some government services,

18:12.923 --> 18:16.524
as well as taking on
some of Eagleton's debts.

18:16.526 --> 18:17.675
[Murmuring, commotion]

18:17.677 --> 18:18.860
I understand.

18:18.862 --> 18:20.829
Look, I hate Eagletonians
as much as you do.

18:20.831 --> 18:22.480
I hate their stupid
beautiful faces

18:22.482 --> 18:24.549
and their stupid shiny hair.

18:24.551 --> 18:25.850
We looked at every alternative.

18:25.852 --> 18:27.218
This is the only scenario

18:27.220 --> 18:29.054
that prevents
Eagleton's financial crisis

18:29.056 --> 18:30.955
from spiraling throughout
the entire region.

18:30.957 --> 18:32.690
Eagleton is terrible!

18:32.692 --> 18:34.876
Why should I bail them out
with the hard-earned money

18:34.878 --> 18:36.194
from my unemployment check?

18:36.196 --> 18:38.646
All: Yeah!
- Because they are our neighbor

18:38.648 --> 18:39.981
and they've
sprained their ankle.

18:39.983 --> 18:41.900
And when your neighbor
sprains his ankle,

18:41.902 --> 18:43.267
you help him off the court.

18:43.269 --> 18:45.703
I understand you have concerns
and questions,

18:45.705 --> 18:47.722
and we are here
to listen to them.

18:47.724 --> 18:49.808
[Overlapping chatter]
I got something to say.

18:49.810 --> 18:51.059
One at a time, please.

18:51.061 --> 18:52.944
I hate
the one-at-a-time system!

18:52.946 --> 18:54.279
Why should we bail them out?

18:54.281 --> 18:56.081
No one bailed me out
when I got arrested for arson.

18:56.083 --> 18:58.083
You can't just merge two towns.

18:58.085 --> 18:59.717
It's against the rules
of nature.

18:59.719 --> 19:02.137
What's next--
merging a man with his dog?

19:02.139 --> 19:03.388
I live in Eagleton.

19:03.390 --> 19:05.256
And frankly,
I don't like the idea

19:05.258 --> 19:06.591
of living in Pawnee.

19:06.593 --> 19:09.010
They're a little--
oh, what's the word?

19:09.012 --> 19:10.345
Have-no-money.

19:10.347 --> 19:12.263
[Exclamations]

19:12.265 --> 19:15.183
Bertram, that's enough.

19:15.185 --> 19:18.019
First of all,
Eagleton has no money.

19:18.021 --> 19:20.471
Second of all,
they are gracious enough

19:20.473 --> 19:21.823
to throw us a lifeline,

19:21.825 --> 19:23.158
and we should be
eternally grateful

19:23.160 --> 19:24.976
for their generosity.

19:24.978 --> 19:26.644
They're a town of angels--

19:26.646 --> 19:29.447
greasy, denim-clad angels,

19:29.449 --> 19:31.166
but angels nonetheless.

19:31.168 --> 19:32.984
Yeah, we'll take it.

19:34.769 --> 19:36.838
I mean, did you steal this
from a museum?

19:37.078 --> 19:38.578
Maybe find it frozen in ice?

19:38.629 --> 19:40.080
It looks like
the original phone

19:40.131 --> 19:41.548
from the movie <i>Wall Street.</i>

19:41.582 --> 19:44.084
I think it's just
the original phone, period.

19:44.135 --> 19:47.203
Ew, gross,
it has "buttons."

19:47.221 --> 19:49.756
Okay, girls,
this is a magic phone, okay?

19:49.807 --> 19:51.725
Only you and I
have got the numbers.

19:51.759 --> 19:53.894
So if you ever need Ron
for any reason,

19:53.928 --> 19:55.728
you just call and
he'll be there in a flash.

19:55.848 --> 19:58.265
Yes, I will.
I'll keep it right here.

19:58.316 --> 20:00.183
It snaps right in,
snug and secure.

20:00.217 --> 20:01.685
A cell phone belt clip?

20:01.719 --> 20:03.770
No, Ron.
Oh, my God!

20:03.821 --> 20:06.389
Yeah, I can't be seen with you.

20:06.407 --> 20:07.941
Travelin' Ann Perkins!

20:07.992 --> 20:09.392
How was Bloomington?

20:09.410 --> 20:11.028
It was amazing.

20:11.062 --> 20:12.612
They had all the baby
supplies we need,

20:12.663 --> 20:14.531
and they had all this
other cool stuff.

20:14.565 --> 20:16.566
They had
a bike-sharing program

20:16.584 --> 20:20.037
and a vegan
Afghan restaurant and--

20:20.071 --> 20:21.254
Oh, my God.
I'm having one.

20:21.289 --> 20:23.573
- I'm having one right now.
- A contraction?

20:23.591 --> 20:25.759
No. Dude, I'm, like,
three months pregnant.

20:25.793 --> 20:27.961
I-I know.
I'm just so excited.

20:28.012 --> 20:31.765
The thing I'm having
is a gut feeling.

20:31.799 --> 20:33.383
What would you think about
raising our child

20:33.417 --> 20:36.236
somewhere other than Pawnee?

20:37.739 --> 20:39.322
Thank you, Leslie,

20:39.357 --> 20:41.658
from all of us in Eagleton.

20:41.692 --> 20:44.394
Our citizens owe you
a debt of gratitude.

20:44.412 --> 20:45.829
Well, I think
at the end of the day,

20:45.863 --> 20:48.025
everybody realizes
it's something we have to do.

20:48.145 --> 20:49.399
On the bright side,

20:49.434 --> 20:51.835
we did win the basketball game.

20:51.869 --> 20:53.170
I think you owe us some apples.

20:53.204 --> 20:55.205
- You better pay up.
- Oh, you don't want them.

20:55.239 --> 20:57.207
All of Pawnee's apples
have been recalled--

20:57.241 --> 20:59.342
- g. Coli.
- You mean e. Coli?

20:59.377 --> 21:00.510
I wish.

21:00.545 --> 21:02.451
Way easy to treat.

21:02.835 --> 21:04.742
Welcome to Pawnee!
