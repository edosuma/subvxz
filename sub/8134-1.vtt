Well, I wasn't really going
for decorative, exactly.

Oh, those.
Nothing, just, um...

for a graphic novel

my assigned work,

someone as smart

sitting right there

I had a biscotti.

In this scenario,
is my mom Ripley
or the alien queen?

11:23.650 --> 11:24.883
Both.
What?

11:24.885 --> 11:26.618
A mother
defending her young.

and get all the dirt
from your relatives.

I would if I could,
but she doesn't have any.

11:39.666 --> 11:41.666
And my... my dad died
before I was born.

11:41.668 --> 11:43.034

no third cousins,

11:46.306 --> 11:47.906
No, just me and my mom.

Of course.
Obviously.
Yes, obviously.

11:56.249 --> 11:58.149
You guys don't think
that's a little bit
suspicious?

You not knowing
anything about your family?

Your mom could be hiding
some deep, dark secret.

No, seriously.

Demons dig blondes.

Of course they do,
but that's white.

And they don't exactly
like Shakespeare,
okay, Alec?

12:44.364 --> 12:45.964
You're plenty distracting
on your own.

12:45.966 --> 12:48.767
[sighs] So, be yourself.
Is that what
you're trying to say?

12:48.769 --> 12:51.369
Never mind.
Looking good, let's go.

We're ready, Jace.

Nice choice, Izzy.
Demons dig blondes.
[Isabelle] Told you.

12:56.276 --> 12:57.475
[Alec] It's platinum.

All right, guys,
for some reason

12:58.645 --> 13:00.078
our demon friends
are killing mundanes

13:00.080 --> 13:01.780
and draining their blood.

13:01.782 --> 13:04.949
Why do they want blood?
Isn't that vampire territory?

13:04.951 --> 13:05.850
I don't know, Alec.

13:06.953 --> 13:08.470
Lazy vampires, maybe?

13:08.471 --> 13:09.988

something special
about their blood.

What could be special
about mundane blood?

13:11.992 --> 13:16.161
You get me a sample
and I'll tell you exactly
what they're looking for.

13:16.163 --> 13:17.762
We'll have more answers

13:17.764 --> 13:19.497
when we figure out
exactly who the demons
are working for.

13:19.499 --> 13:21.666
So, you don't think
they're acting on their own?

13:21.668 --> 13:23.735
No.

13:23.736 --> 13:25.803
They're not exactly
creative thinkers,
they're shapeshifters.

13:27.774 --> 13:29.874
This is what
our target looks like.

13:30.977 --> 13:32.977
[Isabelle] For now.

13:32.979 --> 13:35.079
Great.
I'll get approval
for the mission.

13:35.081 --> 13:36.514
Come on, Alec.

13:36.516 --> 13:37.816
By the time you've
sent that message,

13:37.818 --> 13:39.851
we'll have killed
six demons.

13:39.853 --> 13:43.988
Besides, it's more fun
to break the rules
than to follow them.

14:08.615 --> 14:10.114
[Maureen] Thanks
for being our roadie.

14:10.116 --> 14:13.051
Yeah, and thank you
for being our

14:13.053 --> 14:14.385
Of course.

So, you went on stage tonight
as Champagne Enema.

What were we
thinking, right?

14:22.062 --> 14:23.828
But now...

14:23.830 --> 14:25.063
we're Rock Solid Panda.

Yeah, we are.

[Clary gasps]

14:38.745 --> 14:40.411
What's that tag?

14:41.414 --> 14:44.082
Weird, I didn't even
mean to draw that.

14:44.084 --> 14:45.750
Second time today.

14:45.752 --> 14:46.985
You know they have
confirmed cases

14:46.987 --> 14:49.320
of people waking up
in the morning
speaking French,

14:49.322 --> 14:51.823
and they never even
studied the language.

14:51.825 --> 14:53.925
Do you think that's
some kind of language?

14:53.927 --> 14:55.260
Sanskrit maybe.

15:00.367 --> 15:02.433
Hey, can you watch
where you're going?

15:05.005 --> 15:06.371
You can see me?

15:06.373 --> 15:08.072
Yeah, that's kind of
the point,

15:08.074 --> 15:10.074
but you obviously
didn't see me.

15:10.076 --> 15:11.409
You have the Sight.

15:11.411 --> 15:13.244
Wait, the what?

How can I not know
who you are?

15:15.849 --> 15:18.883

ever worked for you?

you were talking to?

[Clary] No,

in your latte?

15:56.056 --> 15:57.155
Where you going?

15:57.157 --> 15:58.256

look like

you were talking about?

Who cares, Mom, okay?
Are you even listening to me?

20:50.283 --> 20:51.449
I think I killed a guy.

did they look like this?

20:57.457 --> 20:59.257

20:59.259 --> 21:02.927
Everything you saw tonight
has a meaning
and an explanation,

21:02.929 --> 21:05.162
and I've dreaded having
this conversation with you

21:05.164 --> 21:06.430
since the day you were born.

But the protections
are wearing off.

You're 18 now,
and you need to
know the truth.

What does that even mean?

Mom, you're scaring
the hell out of me.

21:18.978 --> 21:20.378

I've put this off

possible minute.

I got a very
powerful person angry.

21:37.096 --> 21:38.229
What did you do?

21:38.231 --> 21:40.097
I hid something from him
and his followers.

21:40.099 --> 21:41.899
Followers?
Why can't we just
call the police?

you need to call is Luke.

is happening?

Everything I've done,

22:16.769 --> 22:18.969

was because I love you
more than words.

Luke will explain everything.

you can trust.

doing here so late?

22:48.000 --> 22:50.368
Uh, um...

22:50.370 --> 22:52.703
Luke said he'd,
uh, drive me home
if he was still here.

22:52.705 --> 22:55.506
Still doesn't trust
those cabbies, huh?

22:55.508 --> 22:59.243
Well, he's in
the middle of an interview.
It could take a while.

22:59.245 --> 23:01.679
[stammers] Cool,
I'll wait in the cafeteria.

23:01.681 --> 23:05.716

some sort of problem?

23:07.720 --> 23:08.886
Yeah, sure.

be over if you just
turn over the Mortal Cup.

That's not gonna happen.

you're still after it?

24:55.661 --> 24:58.696
[scoffs] It's not for us.

24:59.298 --> 25:00.664
It's for him.

Valentine's still alive.

25:03.636 --> 25:06.203
He'll be pretty surprised
to see that you are, too.

25:06.205 --> 25:08.372
I won't let Valentine
create an army.

25:08.374 --> 25:09.874
You once believed in him.

25:09.876 --> 25:12.877
I believed in
protecting humankind.

25:17.550 --> 25:19.083
You'll never get the Cup.

25:22.154 --> 25:23.687
No!

25:27.693 --> 25:29.293

25:29.294 --> 25:30.894
[man] The minute we found out
Jocelyn Fairchild was alive,

25:30.897 --> 25:32.530
you were easy to track.

25:32.532 --> 25:33.964
Fairchild?

25:33.966 --> 25:35.165
Turns out you and Jocelyn
were never that far apart.

25:35.167 --> 25:36.534
The Circle has her now.

25:36.536 --> 25:38.669
It's just a matter of time
until we catch the daughter.

25:38.671 --> 25:41.572
You can have them both
if you give up
the Mortal Cup.

25:43.009 --> 25:46.243
I don't care
about either of them.
They mean nothing to me.

25:46.245 --> 25:48.612

[Luke] Kill them both
if you like.

25:49.382 --> 25:51.582

Why do you think
I've been hanging around
here all these years?

25:53.653 --> 25:55.319
Now, when I find the Cup...

25:55.922 --> 25:57.221
I'm gonna keep it.

25:57.223 --> 25:59.223
And you can tell Valentine
and the Circle that.

25:59.225 --> 26:00.591
No one mentioned Valentine.

26:00.593 --> 26:01.525
You didn't have to.

26:01.527 --> 26:03.761
Listen to me.
No, you listen to me.

this way, Jocelyn.

What happened?

27:24.910 --> 27:26.644
A potion.

27:26.646 --> 27:28.512
She must have been
under the protection
of a warlock.

27:28.514 --> 27:31.815
She was in league
with the Downworlder,
hiding amongst the mundane.

27:31.817 --> 27:33.317
Coward.

27:33.319 --> 27:36.854
Jocelyn Fairchild
was able to hide from
the Circle for 18 years.

27:36.856 --> 27:38.822
Do you think a coward
is capable of
something like that?

27:38.824 --> 27:41.492
The only thing
she's capable of is
smelling like a mundane.

27:44.764 --> 27:45.829
I'm sorry?

27:45.831 --> 27:47.798
She betrayed the Circle.

She doesn't deserve
our respect.

Dot.

29:27.767 --> 29:29.466
They took Jocelyn.

29:29.769 --> 29:31.368
Who took her?

29:31.370 --> 29:35.038
Rogue Shadowhunters
searching for
the Mortal Cup.

29:35.040 --> 29:36.874
What the hell are you
talking about?

29:37.710 --> 29:39.376
Think, Clary.

29:39.378 --> 29:41.311
Did your mother
ever talk to you
about a cup?

29:41.313 --> 29:42.613
A very important cup.

29:42.615 --> 29:44.782
[stuttering] It's gold,
almost like a chalice.

29:44.784 --> 29:47.251
No! No, I don't know
anything about a cup, Dot.

29:47.253 --> 29:49.119
[stammers] One of
the antiquities downstairs?

29:49.121 --> 29:50.921
No, no, not those.

29:50.923 --> 29:53.423
[inhales deeply]
Think, Clary.
This could save Jocelyn.

29:53.425 --> 29:56.727
I can't think!
Someone kidnapped
my mother!

29:56.729 --> 29:59.429
You know more than
you think you do,
Clary Fray.

29:59.431 --> 30:00.964
[screeching]

30:00.966 --> 30:03.567
[Clary grunts and groans]

30:03.569 --> 30:04.802
[Dot growling]

30:04.804 --> 30:07.004
[screeches]

30:07.006 --> 30:08.205
[exclaims]

30:10.643 --> 30:12.342
[growls]
[Clary gasps]

30:19.485 --> 30:20.751
[crying]

30:20.753 --> 30:22.419
[screeches]

30:25.024 --> 30:26.557
[gasps]

30:29.361 --> 30:31.862
What, no "thank you"
for saving your life?

30:33.933 --> 30:36.333
Careful. That demon
got a piece of you.

30:37.169 --> 30:39.937
Demons?
Yeah.

30:39.939 --> 30:42.306
What do you think
that miserable,
disgusting thing was?

30:42.308 --> 30:44.675
I, uh...
I thought it was Dot.

30:44.677 --> 30:48.045
[voice echoes]
No, Ravener demon,
shapeshifter.

30:48.047 --> 30:50.848
[sighs] You're just
saying words now.

30:50.850 --> 30:53.984
[pants] Why...
why is the room swirling?

30:53.986 --> 30:55.052
Demon venom.

30:55.054 --> 30:55.886
[breathing heavily]

30:55.888 --> 30:57.554
It's that bad?

31:03.729 --> 31:04.962
I got you.

31:12.004 --> 31:13.971
[low humming]

31:15.407 --> 31:17.441
[muttering]

31:20.079 --> 31:22.880
[Valentine] Jocelyn,
you're back with me.

31:24.483 --> 31:26.083
[moaning]

31:28.587 --> 31:30.087
[gasps]
[smacks head]

31:30.089 --> 31:31.321
Ow.

31:31.323 --> 31:33.090
[sighs]

31:33.092 --> 31:36.260
Wait, I don't know
who you--
I'm Isabelle.

31:36.262 --> 31:39.229
I've never seen Jace
so curious
about a mundane...

31:40.065 --> 31:41.765
or distracted.

31:41.767 --> 31:45.102
Like you saw earlier,
distractions are dangerous
in our line of work.

31:45.104 --> 31:47.271
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

31:47.273 --> 31:48.605
Who's Jace?

31:48.607 --> 31:52.009
You really don't know much,
do you?

31:52.011 --> 31:55.746
All I know is some psychos
took my mother, and now
you people have taken me.

31:55.748 --> 32:00.017
[chuckles] And by "taken"
I assume you mean
"saved your life"?

32:01.720 --> 32:02.786
[Alec] A mundane
shouldn't even be here.

32:02.788 --> 32:03.921
Where is
"here" exactly?

32:03.923 --> 32:06.123
She's not a mundane, Alec.
How do you know that?

32:06.125 --> 32:08.292
Because the seraph blade
lit up when she touched it.

32:08.294 --> 32:09.927
Look, Isabelle,
can you...

32:09.929 --> 32:13.263
[sighs] I'm Jace Wayland.

32:13.265 --> 32:16.199
I'm, uh--
Clary Fray,
we know who you are.

32:16.201 --> 32:18.068
Am I the only one
who finds this unusual?

32:18.070 --> 32:20.103
You find everything
unusual, Alec.

32:20.105 --> 32:21.138
[Alec] I have to
report this to the Clave.

32:21.140 --> 32:23.206
[Jace] You know what?
Dial it down a notch.

32:23.208 --> 32:25.108
[Isabelle] My brother
doesn't have a dial.

32:25.110 --> 32:28.111
I love you, Alec,
but you have
a switch that's always on.

32:28.113 --> 32:29.780
I love you, too.
But this--

32:29.782 --> 32:32.983
Hey, you know what?
Give me a minute.

32:35.387 --> 32:38.055
Here's a word you
never hear me say.
Please?

32:39.558 --> 32:40.824
What is with you?

32:40.826 --> 32:42.259
Really, no,
what is with him?

32:42.261 --> 32:44.061
Walk with me,
big brother.

32:46.632 --> 32:47.998
I'll explain it to you.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.099
We don't know this girl.

32:49.101 --> 32:50.934
There's no such thing
as new Shadowhunters.

32:50.936 --> 32:53.003
There is now.
You don't find that strange?

32:53.005 --> 32:56.139
What I find strange
is that you're so upset.

32:56.141 --> 32:59.776
Maybe you're upset
by the way Jace is
looking at her. [chuckles]

32:59.778 --> 33:02.279
You know, you should be
happy that Jace
is interested in someone

33:02.281 --> 33:03.513
other than himself.

33:03.515 --> 33:05.649
Maybe I'm pissed
that she's ruined
the mission.

33:05.651 --> 33:07.684
We never found out
who's buying the blood.

33:07.686 --> 33:09.353
That was our one job.

33:12.624 --> 33:15.025
Your wound, it's healed.

33:16.762 --> 33:18.829
How is that even possible?

33:18.831 --> 33:22.165
So, what,
I'm miraculously healed,
and all of you...

33:22.167 --> 33:25.168
stunning people
have magical powers?

33:25.170 --> 33:28.038
[scoffs] No.
No, don't confuse me
with a warlock.

33:28.040 --> 33:31.041
A what?
A warlock.
It's one of the Downworlders.

33:31.043 --> 33:33.043
Okay, you're not
making any sense.

33:34.146 --> 33:35.779
Warlocks, vampires,
Seelies--

33:35.781 --> 33:38.148
Literally my brain
is about to explode.

33:38.150 --> 33:40.250
Jeez, all right.
Well, I'll keep it
simple for you.

33:41.286 --> 33:43.120
All the legends are true.

33:44.156 --> 33:46.056
We're Shadowhunters.

33:46.058 --> 33:49.192
We protect the human world
from the demon world.

33:49.194 --> 33:53.196
So those people
you saw murdered
at the Pandemonium,

33:53.198 --> 33:56.033
they weren't people at all,
they were
shapeshifting demons.

33:56.035 --> 34:00.404
I'm not interested
in being a part of your
supernatural fight club.

34:01.573 --> 34:04.241
I just wanna find my mom.

34:04.243 --> 34:05.709
[voice breaking]
The rest of it,
whatever it is,

34:05.711 --> 34:06.810
all I care about

34:06.812 --> 34:08.145
is finding my mother.

34:10.082 --> 34:11.381
[softly] Please.

34:12.751 --> 34:14.484
Please help me find her.

34:15.821 --> 34:17.454
I'm the best chance
you've got.

34:20.059 --> 34:21.892
I don't even know you.

34:23.429 --> 34:25.262
[cell phone ringing]

34:26.565 --> 34:28.265
Simon.

34:28.267 --> 34:30.167
How come you haven't answered
your phone in two days?

34:30.169 --> 34:32.769
Things are...
all ripped apart.

34:32.771 --> 34:34.271
Where are you?

34:34.273 --> 34:35.872
Find My Friends
says your phone is

34:35.874 --> 34:37.441
in an abandoned church
on Deighton.

34:37.443 --> 34:38.809
I'm outside.

34:44.016 --> 34:45.415
[exhales] I see you.

34:45.417 --> 34:46.917
I don't see you.

34:46.919 --> 34:48.752
Give me five minutes.
I have to get dressed.

34:48.754 --> 34:51.188
[Simon] <i> Dressed?</i>
<i>What are you doing undressed</i>
<i> in an abandoned church?</i>

34:51.190 --> 34:54.257
Clary, is there...
Is there a meth problem
we have to talk about?

34:54.259 --> 34:56.493
Simon, just give me
five minutes, okay?

34:58.263 --> 35:01.198
Um, what, uh...
What happened to my clothes?

35:01.200 --> 35:02.065
Demon venom.

35:02.067 --> 35:04.000
Remember?

35:04.536 --> 35:06.036
Isabelle left you these.

35:08.807 --> 35:10.740
[chuckles]

35:10.742 --> 35:11.875
You're kidding, right?

35:11.877 --> 35:14.511
She's very comfortable
with her body.

35:16.115 --> 35:17.481
Okay.

35:23.655 --> 35:25.122
[huffs]

35:25.124 --> 35:26.556
How did that get there?

35:26.558 --> 35:28.225
I drew that.

35:28.227 --> 35:29.643
Okay, listen.

35:29.644 --> 35:31.060
I still don't get everything
that's going on here,

35:31.063 --> 35:32.829
but you do not
tattoo my neck.

35:32.831 --> 35:34.331
That's creepy.

35:34.333 --> 35:37.400
Duly noted.
I guess next time
I'll just let you die.

35:38.403 --> 35:40.237
And it's not a tattoo.

35:41.340 --> 35:42.305
It's a rune.

35:43.342 --> 35:46.143
They have enormous power.

35:46.145 --> 35:48.011
Good for Shadowhunters.

35:48.013 --> 35:49.446
Lethal for humans.

35:49.448 --> 35:52.649
But you, you already know
all about runes, don't you?

35:58.290 --> 35:59.389
Maybe you don't.

36:01.193 --> 36:04.628
Which is what makes you
so interesting...

36:04.630 --> 36:06.696
Clary Fray.

36:09.768 --> 36:12.669
I saw something
behind your friend.

36:12.671 --> 36:14.337
You're not gonna
kill Simon, are you?

36:14.339 --> 36:18.308
Protect the humans,
kill the demons.
You'll get it eventually.

36:18.310 --> 36:20.010
[door opens]

36:20.012 --> 36:22.546
So, why can't Simon see you?

36:22.548 --> 36:27.184
This is a glamour,
a rune that makes me
invisible to mundanes.

36:27.186 --> 36:28.852
It's a shame,
really, 'cause...

36:28.854 --> 36:30.387
well, denying them all this.

36:32.324 --> 36:35.292
What do you have on, Clary?

36:36.895 --> 36:38.895
Let me take you home.

36:38.897 --> 36:40.964
I don't think
I have one anymore.

36:40.966 --> 36:43.099
Why? What do you mean?

36:44.736 --> 36:46.036
Well...

36:46.038 --> 36:48.071
[man] Clary Fairchild!

36:52.544 --> 36:54.411
[gasps]
Clary, what's going on?

36:55.547 --> 36:56.680
What are you looking at?

36:56.682 --> 36:58.748
If you give us the girl,
I'll let you live.

36:58.750 --> 37:01.184
You're in no position
to be making rules.

37:01.186 --> 37:03.153
[Jace grunts]
[Clary gasps]

37:03.155 --> 37:04.287
Clary...

37:05.390 --> 37:06.389
[yelps]

37:11.763 --> 37:13.663
[both grunting]

37:13.665 --> 37:16.766
[strained] We'll never stop
hunting her.
This is for my father.

37:16.768 --> 37:18.702
[gasps]

37:18.704 --> 37:20.570
[panting]

37:20.572 --> 37:22.405
Jace!
Excuse me?

37:23.609 --> 37:25.976
Is he dead?
Is who dead?

37:29.948 --> 37:31.381
What the...

37:31.383 --> 37:32.882
Could you deglamourize,
or whatever,

37:32.884 --> 37:35.418
so my best friend
doesn't think
I'm losing my mind?

37:42.628 --> 37:44.794
Um...
what is happening?

37:44.796 --> 37:47.731
Yeah, we don't have
the luxury right now, kid.
Everyone back inside.

37:47.733 --> 37:49.132
Clary, who is this?
Your meth dealer?

37:49.134 --> 37:51.268
I've seen him before.
At the police station.

37:51.270 --> 37:54.237
He's a member of the Circle.
Clary, he's here for you.

37:54.239 --> 37:55.572
He's with the people
who took my mother.

37:55.574 --> 37:58.275
Right, your little
best friend here
led him right to you.

37:58.277 --> 38:00.310
He's here to capture
or kill you.

38:00.312 --> 38:02.245
There's a dead body there,
we have to call Luke.

38:02.247 --> 38:05.148
We can't trust Luke, Simon.
We can't.

38:05.150 --> 38:08.418
Clary, I need to
keep you safe.

38:08.420 --> 38:13.256
I promise you,
I promise I am gonna
help you find your mother.

38:13.258 --> 38:15.292
But you're one of us.
You're a Shadowhunter.

38:15.294 --> 38:16.459
[Simon] What are you
talking about?

38:16.461 --> 38:20.930
Clary... you don't know
this guy, all right?

38:20.932 --> 38:23.400
Come with me.
I can get us help.

38:23.402 --> 38:24.334
Clary, please.

38:24.336 --> 38:26.202
Clary, come on.

38:30.609 --> 38:32.909
I don't see the Mortal Cup!

38:33.979 --> 38:35.812
We searched.

38:35.814 --> 38:37.647
It's not in the loft.

38:37.649 --> 38:41.518
Just because
you couldn't find it
doesn't mean it isn't there.

38:44.823 --> 38:46.489
There's a daughter.

38:46.491 --> 38:49.359
[stammering] It looks
just like Jocelyn.

38:49.361 --> 38:51.428
There's no sign
of the father.

38:52.030 --> 38:54.064
Could be a mundane.

38:57.836 --> 38:59.369
Jocelyn has a daughter?

39:00.305 --> 39:01.705
[inhales]

39:01.707 --> 39:05.542
Well, in that case,
I'd like to speak to
Jocelyn's daughter.
