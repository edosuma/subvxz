01:34.393 --> 01:37.593
Happy birthday to me.
Happy birthday to me.

01:38.693 --> 01:41.733
How in hell did I
end up here again..

01:43.383 --> 01:45.400
Fuck off.

02:51.861 --> 02:57.025
My birthday actually began
the way of all my birthdays.

03:07.644 --> 03:10.516
Hello darling. Just ringing
to wish you a happy birthday.

03:10.644 --> 03:13.213
Mom? It's six a.m.

03:13.224 --> 03:16.768
I'm doing the FaceTime.
Una taught me. It's really marvellous.

03:16.892 --> 03:20.808
Mum, the point of FaceTime is that you
haven't got to put the phone to your ear.

03:20.932 --> 03:23.808
Oh, please..
Oh, there you are.

03:23.932 --> 03:26.600
This time, 43 years ago...

03:26.732 --> 03:30.335
I was having a lamb beriyami in an
attempt to coax you out.

03:30.708 --> 03:34.216
23 hours of labour.
Never been the same down there.

03:34.308 --> 03:37.813
It's a miracle, the gift of childbirth.
- Here it comes.

03:37.824 --> 03:41.144
Penny Husband-Bosworth's son
sells his sperm on the internet.

03:41.155 --> 03:43.257
You don't need a man, Bridget.

03:43.268 --> 03:46.452
Some people have marvellous lives
without them. Look at you.

03:46.463 --> 03:49.060
Nice flat, lovely job...

03:49.184 --> 03:52.268
Nice flat...
- I'm putting the phone down now, mum.

03:53.504 --> 03:56.432
Say happy birthday to Bridget.
Colin?

03:56.560 --> 03:58.184
Happy birthday to Bridget.

03:58.976 --> 04:00.438
Thank you.

04:00.613 --> 04:02.644
I love you darling. Now don't forget...

04:02.768 --> 04:05.436
I'm counting on you to head up
my media campaign.

04:05.447 --> 04:09.184
It's the parish council elections, mum.
Not the US primaries.

04:11.480 --> 04:16.600
The annual phone call from mum reminding
me to take my ovaries out of retirement.

04:16.724 --> 04:20.767
The truth was that by now I thought
I would have had a little baby to love

04:20.892 --> 04:23.100
with the chisel jawed love of my life.

04:23.224 --> 04:26.768
But sometimes life gives
you shallower compensations

04:26.892 --> 04:30.392
and at least I was finally down
to my perfect weight.

04:31.932 --> 04:33.144
Good morning, Ms. Bridget.

04:33.268 --> 04:34.852
You look beautiful again today.

04:34.976 --> 04:37.684
There was life in the old dog yet.

04:37.808 --> 04:40.852
Haven't exactly been put out to grass.

04:40.976 --> 04:42.976
Hah! Ding dong..

04:44.144 --> 04:47.768
But this year all these things
were brought into sharper focus...

04:47.892 --> 04:52.016
by an event I hadn't expected
to attend quite so soon.

05:04.899 --> 05:05.899
Hi.

05:09.892 --> 05:11.881
So how are you feeling?
Are you ok?

05:12.978 --> 05:14.104
Mm. Yeah.

05:14.115 --> 05:16.335
I just can't believe he's gone, really.

05:36.846 --> 05:39.422
His death seems to have
hit the eastern European

05:39.422 --> 05:42.022
teenage modelling community
particularly hard.

05:43.892 --> 05:47.060
They found the flight recorder
but still no bodies.

05:48.008 --> 05:51.476
Strangely fitting that he should
have died going down in the bush.

05:57.476 --> 06:01.060
We are gathered here
to celebrate the life...

06:01.184 --> 06:04.749
of Daniel Vivian Cleaver.

06:04.852 --> 06:09.932
Daniel was a kind and wonderful son...

06:10.328 --> 06:13.145
Fuck. What the fuck is he doing here?

06:14.600 --> 06:18.144
You know what he's like,
wanting to do the decent thing.

06:18.744 --> 06:20.255
Is that his wife?

06:21.684 --> 06:24.392
Did I ever get over losing Mr. Darcy?

06:24.745 --> 06:27.037
Was he my Mr. Right?

06:27.308 --> 06:28.560
Oh Christ.

06:28.684 --> 06:33.892
A man of outstanding charm and charisma.

06:34.143 --> 06:37.771
Just a bit emotional.
- I would like to invite his loved ones up...

06:38.684 --> 06:43.684
to share some of their memories of Daniel.

06:45.600 --> 06:47.892
Daniel could be very sensitive ...

06:48.109 --> 06:50.916
Make you feel like you were
the only woman in the world.

06:50.927 --> 06:52.589
I first met Daniel in Moscow.

06:52.600 --> 06:56.509
He once took me rowing on the
Serpentine and quoted Keats by heart.

06:56.520 --> 07:00.224
He could quote Keats by heart.
- Where be ye going,you Devon maid.

07:00.352 --> 07:03.516
And what have you there in the basket?
- Where are you going, you Devon maid.

07:03.644 --> 07:06.224
And what have you there in the basket?

07:07.050 --> 07:10.505
You tight little fairy,
just fresh from the dairy.

07:10.516 --> 07:13.144
Will you give me some cream if I ask it?

07:17.392 --> 07:19.020
He did it to everyone.

07:19.432 --> 07:22.724
Anybody else like to say a few words?

07:23.169 --> 07:24.709
Say something for his mum.

07:27.932 --> 07:29.308
Come on.

07:41.892 --> 07:44.515
Daniel was a man ...

07:45.600 --> 07:51.278
who touched many of us here today,
including me.

07:55.106 --> 07:56.190
Oh dear.

07:57.224 --> 08:00.745
This is when Daniel would say,
"Shut up, Jones."

08:00.756 --> 08:05.144
And he would be right,
because all I really need to say is...

08:06.016 --> 08:09.852
Dear Daniel, I will miss you terribly.

08:10.560 --> 08:11.852
We all will.

08:17.976 --> 08:20.684
Give you a call?
- Yes very good. Bye bye.

08:21.476 --> 08:23.426
Bridget.
- Mark.

08:24.167 --> 08:26.472
This is Camilla.
- Hello.

08:26.483 --> 08:28.494
Bridget, an old friend.

08:28.505 --> 08:31.773
Well, less old, more childhood.

08:33.567 --> 08:34.735
So...

08:35.432 --> 08:39.003
Nice memorial, as memorials go.

08:39.023 --> 08:42.345
Almost makes one look
forward to one's own.

08:44.414 --> 08:46.166
Yes, well...

08:47.357 --> 08:49.317
Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

08:52.948 --> 08:56.219
Maybe that's the reason Mark
Darcy and I never made it.

08:56.414 --> 09:00.746
I always felt like a verbally incontinent old maid,
even when we were together.

09:01.352 --> 09:04.284
Still, I wasn't going to
dwell on the negatives.

09:04.295 --> 09:07.184
At least no-one at work
knew it was my birthday.

09:07.442 --> 09:09.996
Or indeed, how old I was going to be.

09:10.060 --> 09:12.060
Surprise.

09:13.224 --> 09:15.600
Congratulations, Bridget.

09:15.611 --> 09:18.195
Or so I thought.

09:18.743 --> 09:20.495
Who told you?

09:20.506 --> 09:23.050
It's so hot. So many candles.

09:31.268 --> 09:34.360
Isn't there some sort of statute
of limitations about the

09:34.460 --> 09:37.660
number of sodding candles on a cake
once you get to a certain age?

09:38.653 --> 09:43.265
Josh, I need you to see what Reuters
is saying about the attacks on Ramallah.

09:43.276 --> 09:44.965
We might need a live link. And Laura...

09:44.976 --> 09:47.759
I may have been another
year older and still single...

09:47.770 --> 09:51.857
but I could always take consolation
in my job as top news producer.

09:51.868 --> 09:54.844
So, how will I be changing
the world today?

09:54.855 --> 09:57.943
Well, our main feature is the
exclusive interview...

09:57.954 --> 10:00.724
with the Foreign Secretary about NGochi.

10:00.852 --> 10:03.940
Oh, gee. How did you do that?
- NGochi.

10:03.951 --> 10:05.389
NGochi.
- You're good at that.

10:05.400 --> 10:07.100
I know. I've been practising. NGochi.

10:11.887 --> 10:13.839
It's harder than you think.

10:13.850 --> 10:16.270
Plus, have great new 30
something work colleagues

10:16.370 --> 10:18.670
who are not obsessed with
children and marriage.

10:18.681 --> 10:20.864
How do we plan on celebrating tonight?

10:20.875 --> 10:24.537
Well, night out with the gang.
- Please say that involves group sex.

10:24.548 --> 10:27.291
Gangbangs?
Ooh, we'd like to do that.

10:27.302 --> 10:29.793
I know a smashing little club
in the back of Berwick Street.

10:29.804 --> 10:31.685
Chance would be a fine thing.

10:31.696 --> 10:34.543
I'm beginning to think I'm
past my sexual sell by date.

10:34.554 --> 10:37.437
No. There are names for women
like you now, Bridge.

10:37.448 --> 10:39.779
You're a cougar. You are a MILF.

10:39.790 --> 10:45.449
I'm not a MILF, I'm not even a mum.
I am a spinster, I'm a SPILF.

10:45.460 --> 10:49.688
Three minutes 'till we're on air.
- It's called Voyeurz with a 'z'.

10:49.699 --> 10:51.506
You tell them that Cathy sent you.

10:51.517 --> 10:55.116
If you go on a Thursday there's a Chinese buffet.
All you can eat, as it were.

10:56.352 --> 11:00.979
But whose advice was, never the less,
sometimes a tad too modern for me.

11:01.479 --> 11:04.259
It's me, checking talk-back.
- Yep.

11:04.270 --> 11:06.875
You didn't freeze your eggs
by any chance, did you?

11:06.875 --> 11:09.475
No, I imagine they're
hard boiled by now.

11:09.486 --> 11:11.514
You know what, Bridge? This weekend...

11:11.525 --> 11:14.476
you and me need to go out,
and get stuck into some serious...

11:14.600 --> 11:18.706
"Binge drinking, a dangerous scourge on society."

11:18.717 --> 11:20.710
Is new legislation needed?

11:21.684 --> 11:25.464
Bridget, Miranda, I've told you,
don't talk between the bongs.

11:25.814 --> 11:28.005
Stick to the questions on the cue cards.

11:28.129 --> 11:29.173
Miranda. Cue.

11:29.184 --> 11:31.701
The Foreign Secretary will
be live in the studio...

11:31.712 --> 11:34.802
to talk about the looming
crisis in Muribundi.

11:35.310 --> 11:37.947
You can always try online dating again.

11:37.958 --> 11:41.978
The other night I was on Tinder.
Half an hour later I'm having a 3-way with...

11:41.989 --> 11:45.969
Prince Andrew, the Royal Special
Representative for Trade and Investment...

11:45.980 --> 11:49.607
He did that on purpose.
...has just written his first children's book.

11:49.712 --> 11:51.499
He had a massive cock.

11:53.060 --> 11:56.828
Live in the studio I'm joined by
Foreign Secretary George Wilkins...

11:56.839 --> 11:59.388
who has just returned from
war ravaged Muribundi...

11:59.399 --> 12:01.310
Miranda, I'm in your ear.
Just follow my lead.

12:01.321 --> 12:04.366
... Where the assassination of
bloody dictator Charles NGochi...

12:04.377 --> 12:07.516
has resulted in civil war.
- One shot, come back to four. Four.

12:07.527 --> 12:09.760
Minister, was this a military coup?

12:09.860 --> 12:12.660
- Well, the signs are that NGochi's
own generals did take him out...

12:12.684 --> 12:14.589
Hi, Tom. I can't talk.

12:14.843 --> 12:17.949
How was Daniel's memorial?
- It was just sad.

12:17.960 --> 12:19.774
I can't believe he's gone.

12:19.785 --> 12:22.426
It's sad.
I can't believe he's gone, actually.

12:25.063 --> 12:28.020
Ah... I don't think there was any
particular sadness in his passing.

12:28.031 --> 12:31.344
His persecution of the Ubuntu
people amounted to genocide.

12:31.355 --> 12:34.741
And that is well documented.
- I know he had his flaws.

12:34.752 --> 12:37.908
Well, I know he had his flaws.
- He could be a massive asshole.

12:37.919 --> 12:39.757
He could be a massive asshole.

12:41.135 --> 12:45.596
But I miss him. We all do.
- But I miss him. We all do.

12:46.263 --> 12:50.766
Well, he was certainly a very colorful
character on the world stage Miranda...

12:50.777 --> 12:53.243
I grant you that, but I think the genocide...

12:53.254 --> 12:56.977
resulting in the deaths of over 10,000 of his
own people, men, women and children...

12:56.988 --> 12:59.385
probably rather put him on
the wrong side of history.

12:59.396 --> 13:01.212
At least he was never boring.

13:01.312 --> 13:03.212
Well, at least he was never boring.

13:04.398 --> 13:06.268
One, two, three clear.

13:06.392 --> 13:10.092
Do you think a spirit of democracy can
carry over into West Africa...

13:10.103 --> 13:11.803
Now that's NGochi's dead?

13:11.814 --> 13:14.801
Do you think, minister,
that the spirit of democracy can

13:14.801 --> 13:17.701
carry over into West Africa
now that NGochi is dead?

13:17.812 --> 13:20.482
Well now, that is an interesting question.
Finally.

13:20.493 --> 13:22.155
We're running out of time.
- Miranda, wrap it up.

13:22.166 --> 13:24.264
Briefly, please, Minister.
- Well it is a complicated issue.

13:24.275 --> 13:25.633
A 'yes' or a 'no'.

13:25.748 --> 13:28.505
Miranda, make it the last answer.
- Let's hope so.

13:28.964 --> 13:31.643
I'll take that.
Thank you for joining us on the sofa today.

13:31.654 --> 13:33.048
Over to you, Toby.

13:35.268 --> 13:37.476
Thank you, Miranda, Bridget.

13:37.923 --> 13:41.253
You couldn't just behave yourselves when
the new management team were here?

13:41.264 --> 13:42.802
They're the new management team?

13:42.813 --> 13:45.732
That is Alice Peabody,
new brand manager.

13:45.956 --> 13:49.475
Apparently 'Hard News' is too old fashioned,
too serious...

13:49.486 --> 13:53.807
and she is the smiling assassin, brought
in to sack anybody older than her.

13:53.859 --> 13:58.697
Everybody's older than her. I've got tins
of soup in my cupboard older than her.

13:58.708 --> 14:04.044
Look at them all. With their
apps and their ironic beards

14:04.055 --> 14:06.663
Maybe one of them could
get Bridget some sex.

14:06.674 --> 14:08.580
What?
- Bridget? Do you need sex?

14:08.591 --> 14:09.600
No.
- Yes.

14:10.186 --> 14:14.329
That's why I'm taking her on an a girls
weekend to beat all girls weekends.

14:16.510 --> 14:18.567
Bridget, isn't it?

14:18.757 --> 14:21.586
Yes, nice to...
- Team meeting tomorrow morning.

14:21.597 --> 14:23.601
We can do introductions then.

14:31.106 --> 14:32.368
Nine a.m.

14:32.999 --> 14:35.313
We should all start an
hour earlier from now on.

14:37.614 --> 14:40.726
Do you think she saw that?
- Quite possibly not.

14:40.948 --> 14:43.996
And you're sure you don't want to
come out with me and my crew?

14:44.774 --> 14:47.489
Thanks, but can't let the old gang down.

14:47.500 --> 14:50.799
They're stay at home moms now.
They'd be disappointed.

15:04.448 --> 15:06.769
Thank God for the gays.

15:10.224 --> 15:13.609
Now, whatever fears you're
bringing in the room with you today...

15:13.620 --> 15:17.895
I want you take those fears and I want
you to tell them to fuck the fuck off.

15:17.906 --> 15:18.906
Yeah!

15:20.432 --> 15:24.224
Are you ready for this?
- Yes.

15:24.352 --> 15:27.432
Then ride, you sexy bitches! Ride!

15:32.177 --> 15:35.615
Look, I'm so sorry, Bridget, but I'm actually
going to have to blow you out too.

15:37.516 --> 15:42.152
I didn't want to have to tell you this today,
but Eduardo and I are adopting.

15:42.493 --> 15:43.701
Adopting?

15:44.617 --> 15:47.722
What, a baby?
- Yes, a baby.

15:48.436 --> 15:50.364
Or gayby, in our case.

15:51.027 --> 15:54.169
That's fantastic news, Tom.

15:54.180 --> 15:57.377
I'm going to Bogota tomorrow to start
the paperwork so I've got to go and pack.

15:57.388 --> 15:59.512
Wonderful, go.

15:59.523 --> 16:01.420
Happy Birthday. Have fun.

16:01.512 --> 16:03.602
Congratulations.
- Thank's darl.

16:05.225 --> 16:07.816
Fucking excellent.

16:08.295 --> 16:11.866
And that was how I wound
up back here again.

16:12.110 --> 16:14.754
The last barren husk in London...

16:14.796 --> 16:20.786
and of the two loves of my life,
one is married and the other is dead.

16:22.517 --> 16:25.391
Right, new birthday resolutions.

16:25.402 --> 16:28.218
I, Bridget Jones am done
with affairs of the heart...

16:28.229 --> 16:32.268
and dedicating my autumn
years to the pursuit of hedonism.

16:32.279 --> 16:35.471
Will hang only with new free
spirited friends like Miranda...

16:35.482 --> 16:40.776
and when the going gets tough,
the tough go on a luxury spa weekend.

16:42.289 --> 16:44.017
What the fuck.

16:45.487 --> 16:47.192
Love the shoes.

17:01.137 --> 17:04.150
I didn't tell you, because
you wouldn't have come.

17:04.237 --> 17:06.396
Seriously, it's been five years.

17:06.407 --> 17:10.407
You've gotta shake yourself out of this
self imposed purge you've been in...

17:10.419 --> 17:13.340
ever since you split up with your
precious Mark Darcy.

17:13.352 --> 17:15.367
Rubbish.
I barely think of him.

17:15.377 --> 17:17.900
What you need is a good shafting.

17:17.911 --> 17:21.646
You need some good old fashioned,
lie back and think of England bonking...

17:21.656 --> 17:27.329
and festivals are sexual free for alls
like Sodom and Gomorrah with tofu.

17:27.348 --> 17:29.559
First man you meet you've
gotta sleep with.

17:29.570 --> 17:32.236
The first man?
I'm not taking no for an answer.

17:32.292 --> 17:36.031
I'm gonna find our backstage passes.
You get the maps.

17:41.676 --> 17:42.776
Maps.

17:42.787 --> 17:47.738
I may be old and inappropriately dressed,
but at least I look fucking amazing.

17:55.068 --> 17:57.776
That's exactly why I didn't wear my heels.

17:58.577 --> 18:00.608
Ding fucking dong.

18:00.619 --> 18:01.619
May I?

18:17.994 --> 18:19.326
Thank you.

18:24.101 --> 18:25.944
It fits.

18:30.208 --> 18:31.792
Bridget.

18:32.555 --> 18:33.998
Bridget.

18:34.810 --> 18:37.776
Is that your wicked stepmother?
- Yes.

18:37.976 --> 18:41.776
I better go before she has me
sweeping fireplaces all day.

18:43.429 --> 18:45.196
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

18:46.664 --> 18:48.695
Ah ha. Birthday resolution number two.

18:48.706 --> 18:52.487
Must remember the way to a man's heart
is not through beauty, sex or love...

18:52.498 --> 18:53.498
It's Jack.

18:53.607 --> 18:57.692
but merely the ability to
fall arse over tit in the mud.

18:57.755 --> 18:59.087
By the way.

19:00.387 --> 19:01.387
Right.

19:01.941 --> 19:05.692
Which one's ours?
- Let's try up here.

19:05.951 --> 19:09.203
And anyway, it's not camping,
it's glamping.

19:09.287 --> 19:12.509
Putting a G L in front of it
doesn't make it any better.

19:12.520 --> 19:17.112
Calling him Gladolf Hitler wouldn't suddenly
make you forget all the unpleasantness.

19:23.276 --> 19:26.372
Oh... fuck me!

19:31.457 --> 19:33.165
NGochi.

19:37.194 --> 19:39.711
NGochi.

19:41.276 --> 19:44.493
NGochi.

19:48.822 --> 19:52.702
It's 2:30 in the afternoon.
I should be Hoovering.

20:08.536 --> 20:11.798
This is incredible.
We've got to get a photo.

20:12.227 --> 20:13.409
Excuse me?

20:14.247 --> 20:17.009
Do you mind if we ask you
to take a photo of us?

20:17.020 --> 20:18.852
Yeah, sure.
- Thank you.

20:20.931 --> 20:23.108
Alright. Are you ready?
Hey. What're you doing?

20:23.911 --> 20:25.191
I was taking your photo.

20:25.202 --> 20:28.057
I thought you guys wanted a photo.
- Yeah, we do. Of us.

20:28.524 --> 20:32.132
Yes. Terribly sorry. We thought it'd
be really fun to get a photo of us...

20:32.143 --> 20:33.906
backstage among all these glamorous people.

20:33.917 --> 20:35.981
I think that's the guy from 'Bargain Hunt'.

20:35.992 --> 20:39.275
It'd be great if you could get him in the shot.
- Quick. Quick.

20:39.362 --> 20:43.263
So you don't want me in the photo at all?
- No, and you can lose the attitude, babe.

20:43.274 --> 20:45.108
Is it really that difficult?

20:45.481 --> 20:48.856
They let any old riff-raff backstage nowadays.

20:48.867 --> 20:52.984
I don't know. I thought he was
kind of cute. He looks familiar.

20:54.040 --> 20:56.786
I think he works
at the Starbucks at Balham.

21:05.810 --> 21:08.024
One, two, three, singing.

21:14.816 --> 21:17.586
Oh my God.

21:17.872 --> 21:21.524
I know. It's the guy from Starbucks.

21:21.535 --> 21:23.035
Crowdsurfing.

21:41.873 --> 21:43.333
Miranda.

21:45.225 --> 21:46.597
Miranda?

21:48.442 --> 21:49.858
Miranda?

21:54.263 --> 21:55.568
Hey, Miranda.

21:56.605 --> 21:58.595
Oh, God.

22:00.745 --> 22:04.152
I have to admit, that was fun.

22:04.985 --> 22:06.609
And you're right ...

22:06.785 --> 22:11.067
What I need is a good shafting...

22:11.747 --> 22:16.782
some good old-fashioned,
lie back and-think-of-England...

22:17.473 --> 22:18.900
bonking.

22:19.330 --> 22:20.692
Well, sign me up.

22:21.854 --> 22:23.524
Oh my God.

22:25.015 --> 22:27.358
What are you doing in my yurt?

22:28.666 --> 22:33.232
With all your clothes, and
luggage and possessions.

22:33.360 --> 22:36.685
Yeah, it's as if I've come in,
made it my own.

22:36.900 --> 22:40.066
Wait, it's you,
the creature from the Black Lagoon.

22:40.264 --> 22:41.652
Yes. Sorry.

22:41.663 --> 22:45.900
You don't really expect me to believe that you
accidentally crashed into my yurt, do you?

22:47.045 --> 22:50.442
Since you're here, maybe I can help you.

22:51.360 --> 22:54.108
Well, he is the first man I met...

22:54.119 --> 22:57.650
and his yurt is one heck
of a lot nicer than mine.

22:58.692 --> 23:03.152
Bridget, where the fuck are you?

23:03.276 --> 23:07.632
Bridget, I'm so pissed.

23:52.692 --> 23:53.944
Bridget.

23:55.008 --> 23:59.776
I'm zorbing with Ed Sheeran.

24:23.944 --> 24:25.524
Oh, God.

24:25.559 --> 24:30.652
I just slept with a complete stranger.
I'm nothing but a feckless prostitute.

24:31.776 --> 24:36.108
No, no. I'm an elegant older woman
taking men for my own pleasure.

24:36.119 --> 24:38.838
Or am I just a deluded middle-aged fool?

24:46.528 --> 24:48.152
Oh, fuck it.

24:49.900 --> 24:51.152
Miranda?

24:52.932 --> 24:54.140
Good morning.

24:56.108 --> 24:58.444
So it lasted six hours?

24:58.568 --> 25:01.276
What lasted six hours, mum?

25:01.984 --> 25:05.232
A puppet show that Auntie Bridget went to.

25:05.944 --> 25:09.349
A six-hour puppet show?
- Hello.

25:09.360 --> 25:12.108
Tell me, were they little puppets or...?

25:12.232 --> 25:14.108
Very nice size puppets.

25:14.776 --> 25:17.484
And did he...

25:18.608 --> 25:20.768
put his puppet in your mouth?

25:23.316 --> 25:26.457
God! I feel like my days
of puppet shows are behind me.

25:30.568 --> 25:32.507
I've had finger puppets.

25:35.108 --> 25:38.816
And has he called?
- It doesn't work like that any more.

25:38.944 --> 25:42.316
You just hook up with rugged
troubadors at music festivals...

25:42.327 --> 25:44.185
and there are no strings.

25:44.732 --> 25:46.652
Puppets with no strings.

25:47.438 --> 25:49.511
Take the wings off.
They're for little girls.

25:50.524 --> 25:52.154
Hello?
- Where the fuck are you?

25:52.165 --> 25:56.134
Speeding through lovely countryside
on our way to your christening.

25:56.145 --> 25:59.237
No we're not.
Why is auntie Bridget lying?

25:59.984 --> 26:02.743
Bridge, I thought you should
know after Tom dropped out...

26:02.754 --> 26:05.015
Giles asked Mark to be the godfather.
- What?

26:05.026 --> 26:06.423
He did what?

26:06.463 --> 26:08.652
Yes I know. He really
is a useless cock.

26:08.663 --> 26:10.316
Did it without asking me.

26:11.623 --> 26:15.459
Oh my God. Mark Darcy again.

26:15.615 --> 26:20.239
Twice in the space of a week I turn
up at church as rent-a-spinster.

26:23.730 --> 26:26.533
Where the fuck were you?

26:32.163 --> 26:33.941
Sorry.

26:38.117 --> 26:40.507
Good morning and welcome.

26:40.518 --> 26:45.452
Well, this isn't embarrassing at all.
Mark Darcy and I at the altar with a baby.

26:46.272 --> 26:47.980
That's lovely.

26:48.232 --> 26:50.999
Ok, now, nice big smiles.
Look at me. Thank you.

26:51.010 --> 26:52.287
Lovely.

26:52.298 --> 26:54.890
Ok, can I just get
the godparents now please.

26:56.540 --> 26:59.669
How are you?
- Very well, thank you. How are you?

26:59.680 --> 27:01.405
Well, thank you.
Mm.

27:01.604 --> 27:04.892
Are you here with your wife?
I can't remember her name...

27:05.135 --> 27:08.960
Camilla. No, eh, no, she couldn't make it.

27:09.330 --> 27:12.695
Are you here with anyone?
- No, no. Not today, no.

27:13.123 --> 27:15.068
Come on, it's not a funeral.

27:15.192 --> 27:17.121
Can I get a couple of
smiles out of you two, please?

27:17.132 --> 27:19.645
Maybe give her a little kiss
you know, on the forehead, there.

27:23.038 --> 27:24.900
Ah, I was talking about the baby.

27:29.730 --> 27:31.652
Lovely.

27:31.976 --> 27:34.384
Alright. I'll see you later,
shouldn't wonder.

27:34.395 --> 27:37.993
Yes, unless I make a break
for it with this thing.

27:38.520 --> 27:41.866
Could this day actually get
any more awkward?

27:42.071 --> 27:45.206
Just keep walking, keep walking,
keep walking. Keep walking.

27:56.524 --> 27:58.794
Hello.
- Hello.

27:59.404 --> 28:02.087
How are you?
- Very well, thanks.

28:02.098 --> 28:03.558
How are you?
- I'm fine.

28:04.034 --> 28:05.406
So am I.

28:07.087 --> 28:09.464
Well, goodbye.
- Goodbye.

28:10.676 --> 28:12.520
A glass of wine.
- A whiskey, please.

28:12.531 --> 28:14.245
Big, big glass.
- Double.

28:14.256 --> 28:15.483
Thank you.

28:49.310 --> 28:54.944
I'd ask you to join me, but I'm pretty sure
you're not a big Gangnam Style kind of guy.

28:55.068 --> 28:57.394
I was only there very briefly.
- Where?

28:57.405 --> 28:58.441
Gangnam.

29:00.698 --> 29:04.108
What are we talking about?
- Gangnam, dancing.

29:05.278 --> 29:08.293
Not the suburb of Seoul?
- No.

29:08.304 --> 29:13.192
I'm not familiar with Gangnam, the suburb.
- It literally means south of the Han River.

29:14.787 --> 29:17.911
It was inhabited as early as
the Paleolithic period.

29:19.143 --> 29:21.979
Suddenly seems so much less catchy.

29:24.473 --> 29:26.933
Now something for you lovers out there.

29:26.944 --> 29:31.648
We are entering the erection section.
Don't say fucking erection at a christening.

29:37.624 --> 29:39.484
Would you like to get some air?

29:42.069 --> 29:43.985
I mean, some more air.

29:45.083 --> 29:46.502
Sure.

29:55.918 --> 29:59.770
I don't suppose you happen to have a cigarette?
- No.

29:59.927 --> 30:03.551
I gave up 1891 days ago.

30:03.619 --> 30:05.356
Not that people're counting.

30:05.813 --> 30:08.602
Since when did you smoke?
- I don't.

30:09.114 --> 30:10.698
It's been a tense time.

30:12.078 --> 30:13.746
Maybe I'm nervous.

30:15.445 --> 30:16.613
Why?

30:18.765 --> 30:20.557
You have a train in your hair.

30:21.891 --> 30:24.041
I'm aware of that.

30:24.898 --> 30:27.692
Courtesy of one of my many godchildren.

30:32.276 --> 30:35.024
Seems to be stuck.

30:36.706 --> 30:38.414
And this would be...

30:39.033 --> 30:41.661
Cake?
- Profiterole.

30:41.769 --> 30:44.893
That's technically more of
a dessert, I suppose.

30:51.241 --> 30:54.329
What're you doing? You're married.
- No, I'm not.

30:55.941 --> 30:58.583
I mean, I'm getting a divorce.

30:58.878 --> 31:00.546
That's why she's not here.

31:04.405 --> 31:06.825
Why were you together
at the memorial?

31:06.995 --> 31:09.174
She was just being supportive.

31:09.830 --> 31:12.934
She's gone back to The Hague,
where she's now living, and I'm not.

31:14.045 --> 31:15.971
Oh, I'm so sorry, Mark.

31:15.982 --> 31:18.875
At this precise moment I'm not sorry at all.

32:34.481 --> 32:36.712
How the fuck am I supposed to get in here?

32:48.009 --> 32:49.524
Again?

32:50.276 --> 32:52.944
Mr. Darcy, wow.

32:55.944 --> 32:57.152
Bridget?

33:00.692 --> 33:02.232
God, I've missed you.

33:08.926 --> 33:10.816
Are we on schedule?

33:11.944 --> 33:14.192
I have a flight to Khartoum tomorrow.

33:51.608 --> 33:54.316
I'm so sorry, Mark. Had to leave.

33:54.444 --> 33:57.776
It probably sounds pathetic,
but I got scared.

33:57.900 --> 34:01.024
The fact that we went 'round and 'round
for the best part of ten years...

34:01.152 --> 34:04.360
without ever making it
across the finish line leads me to think...

34:04.484 --> 34:07.776
we did the best thing
by ending it when we did.

34:09.400 --> 34:13.315
Sometimes it feels scary
still being on my own at 43.

34:13.444 --> 34:16.152
But you and I have been here once before.

34:18.315 --> 34:20.759
We always loved the fantasy of us...

34:20.770 --> 34:24.658
But the reality,
as we both know, is quite different.

34:32.275 --> 34:35.732
We could both come up with a 100
reasons why we didn't make it...

34:35.860 --> 34:41.568
but in the end I always felt that you were
never there and I was mostly alone.

34:53.068 --> 34:56.400
No, can't go back and keep
making same mistakes.

34:56.524 --> 35:00.245
Must keep moving forward
and make new ones.

35:00.524 --> 35:03.875
And will lodge myself into
frenzied keep fit regimes.

35:03.886 --> 35:06.703
And allowing 4 weeks to reduce
thighs circumference...

35:06.714 --> 35:10.770
to squeeze largy ass into
teenage skinny jeans...

35:10.937 --> 35:14.161
Obviously not meant
for women of a certain age.

35:15.276 --> 35:18.949
All this bloody cycling is pointless.
I'm putting on weight.

35:18.960 --> 35:22.639
Let's rule out some of the other options, shall we?
You're not pregnant, are you?

35:23.068 --> 35:24.652
Of course not.

35:24.776 --> 35:30.045
A lady is always prepared and
I always carry these in my handbag.

35:30.403 --> 35:34.175
Oh, God! You didn't use those,
the vegan condoms?

35:34.186 --> 35:36.541
Biodegradable and dolphin friendly.

35:36.552 --> 35:39.984
If I'm going to be slutty, it's nice
to think I'm helping the environment.

35:40.108 --> 35:43.638
Christ, Bridget.
I remember when you bought those.

35:43.649 --> 35:46.148
That was decades ago.

35:46.230 --> 35:48.902
Sell by dates don't mean anything.

35:49.986 --> 35:50.986
Do they?

35:52.192 --> 35:54.867
They were a gift. Don't ask.

35:56.484 --> 36:00.809
Tumbling rapids,
frothing waterfalls...

36:00.819 --> 36:02.809
babbling brook.

36:05.969 --> 36:08.201
Oh, come the fuck on, Bridget.

36:20.608 --> 36:22.568
How long do you think it takes?

36:25.364 --> 36:28.045
I think that's a positive result.

36:28.532 --> 36:30.238
Pregnant

36:31.900 --> 36:34.305
I'll just make sure.
- Don't shake it.

36:34.316 --> 36:37.152
You'll hurt the baby.
- The baby is not in the stick.

36:39.143 --> 36:40.899
I think this is when you're meant to...

36:41.495 --> 36:43.079
jump for joy.

36:43.944 --> 36:47.158
Oh my God.
- You're pregnant.

36:47.169 --> 36:49.692
I'm pregnant.
- You're pregnant.

36:50.444 --> 36:54.322
I'm pregnant.
- You're going to have a baby.

36:54.923 --> 36:57.118
I'm going to have a baby.

37:01.908 --> 37:04.449
I'm going to have a baby.
- Yes.

37:08.789 --> 37:12.484
If you've got footage of her
punching a horse, I want it.

37:12.641 --> 37:16.165
Bridget, do you want a baby?
- I don't know.

37:17.295 --> 37:19.795
I mean, I'm 43.

37:19.987 --> 37:22.814
It might be the only chance
I'm going to get.

37:22.942 --> 37:28.362
One broken, out of date condom I might
have believed was an acciddent.

37:29.075 --> 37:30.199
But two?

37:32.058 --> 37:33.453
You wanted it.

37:34.662 --> 37:36.314
Maybe I did.

37:39.257 --> 37:41.022
Can we get a medic please?

37:45.123 --> 37:49.076
Oh my God. I'm pregnant.

37:49.734 --> 37:51.522
This is it.

37:51.930 --> 37:55.358
More to the point, whose is it?

37:55.969 --> 37:59.814
This is not how I thought
this moment would be.

38:00.308 --> 38:05.006
I always imagined myself in 'OK!'
magazine with the man of my dreams.

38:05.352 --> 38:08.140
Oh Christ! Too many dilemmas to ponder.

38:08.300 --> 38:09.672
Not least of all...

38:09.840 --> 38:12.796
Who was that man I shagged in a tent?

38:13.535 --> 38:17.787
And so you're age will be 43?

38:21.387 --> 38:22.687
So, umm...

38:23.559 --> 38:30.059
Which of the times with my wonderful
man do you think we got pregnant on?

38:30.190 --> 38:31.606
Does it matter?

38:31.734 --> 38:35.319
Well, yes, it's such a special moment.

38:35.330 --> 38:38.419
We'd like to know which one
it is so we can treasure it.

38:38.430 --> 38:42.755
Can't you treasure both of them?
- Yes, we will, we do.

38:42.766 --> 38:47.066
But surely one of those days is
more likely than the other?

38:47.424 --> 38:53.398
Well, actually, day 10, which was
his birthday, is a little early.

38:53.409 --> 38:57.734
And day 16 which was the...
- Anniversary dinner.

38:57.745 --> 39:01.150
Oh yes, the Osso Buco, I recall,
is a little late.

39:01.161 --> 39:04.295
Are you sure there wasn't another
treasurable occasion in between?

39:04.701 --> 39:08.339
Yes, I'm quite sure.
He was away.

39:09.826 --> 39:12.158
So which of the two would you go for?

39:12.314 --> 39:15.734
Couldn't say. They're both equally likely.
It could have been after the event.

39:15.745 --> 39:18.538
Because as you know, sperm can live
for several days after ejaculation.

39:18.641 --> 39:21.069
Couldn't you just have a guess for me?
- No.

39:21.228 --> 39:25.066
What about the first scan?
Would that show when conception took place?

39:25.077 --> 39:27.606
No. Ring this number to fix a date.

39:27.734 --> 39:30.690
And do bring along the father,
if you can work out which one he is.

39:32.543 --> 39:33.667
Right.

39:35.067 --> 39:36.067
Right.

39:37.106 --> 39:43.442
Just out of interest... If someone did have an
element of confusion about the father...

39:43.453 --> 39:48.206
Well, you can get a DNA sample at the
amniocentesis, and I do recommend that you have

39:48.217 --> 39:52.274
the amniocentesis, because there are
always more risks with a geriatric mother.

39:54.536 --> 39:55.935
Geriatric?
Hmm.

39:56.491 --> 39:59.066
That's outrageous.
- Indeed.

40:00.583 --> 40:04.663
Unless you can sign on for your child
support and pension at the same time.

40:06.398 --> 40:07.763
That's hilarious.

40:09.930 --> 40:12.763
It's called "news"
'cause it should feel new.

40:12.774 --> 40:15.799
Otherwise, it be called "olds".

40:15.951 --> 40:17.077
Sorry.

40:18.209 --> 40:20.487
Last night. Top stories.

40:20.498 --> 40:22.829
Earthquake in Asia, seen it before.

40:22.956 --> 40:25.858
Car crash on the M5...
Blah blah blah

40:25.869 --> 40:29.710
We're making 'old's.
We need to flip the switch, mix it up.

40:29.742 --> 40:32.831
I want a new triple on the shit out.
- She's on the warpath.

40:32.842 --> 40:36.314
Susan, the floor manager's gone.
- She's six months pregnant.

40:36.325 --> 40:40.298
We've got to grab the attention,
get the eyes on the screen.

40:40.360 --> 40:45.169
I want to see headlines like:
"Is Your Sofa Bed Giving You Cancer?"

40:45.351 --> 40:49.823
"Is Your Freezer Giving You Alzheimers?"
- Oh my God. Are they?

40:49.862 --> 40:53.907
Literally no evidence whatsoever, but you're
missing the point. You're intrigued, aren't you?

40:54.502 --> 40:58.836
I want to reload 'Hard News'
with a clear new objective.

40:58.852 --> 41:02.004
We have a presentation in twelve
weeks at the London Media Show...

41:02.020 --> 41:06.717
and I'm looking for someone dynamic,
innovative, focused...

41:06.733 --> 41:08.873
to lead the charge. Any volunteers?

41:08.984 --> 41:11.834
Whatever happens now,
must hold on to job.

41:11.858 --> 41:15.358
Must prove to fascist boss
that I may be single mother...

41:15.381 --> 41:18.112
but am willing to roll with the
ironic bearded hipsters.

41:18.136 --> 41:19.358
Anybody at all?

41:20.882 --> 41:25.479
Do you need to leave, Bridget?
- No, I want to volunteer.

41:25.788 --> 41:28.035
Hashtag: "Let's do this!"

41:37.251 --> 41:43.215
It's me. Turn on your TV now. Look at your TV.
Now. Now. Now. Turn on Channel 4.

41:46.314 --> 41:50.681
Bridget, I've found him.
He's the dating website guru.

41:50.697 --> 41:54.651
See, you have to trust the science.
Algorithms don't lie.

41:54.678 --> 41:58.105
You slept with a fucking billionaire.

42:00.525 --> 42:03.007
So, tell us, Bridget.

42:03.308 --> 42:06.861
What was it that initially attracted you
to the billionaire Jack Qwant?

42:06.877 --> 42:10.603
Was it his face, or his body? Big dick?
- I'd do it with him, obviously.

42:10.642 --> 42:12.809
If I were you I wouldn't tell either of them.

42:12.824 --> 42:18.402
All you need is a  DNA sample from one of them and then
you can eliminate the other one from your enquiries.

42:18.425 --> 42:22.834
What would I say to Mark?
"Hello Mark, I know I just left you asleep...

42:22.858 --> 42:27.127
but do you have any blood,
sperm or old fingernails lying around? "

42:27.187 --> 42:29.152
How do you even get in touch with Jack?

42:30.321 --> 42:31.321
Yeah.

42:32.315 --> 42:36.271
He is a bloody mogul.
Can't just ring him up.

42:38.561 --> 42:42.652
I may have just figured out how
to win favour with new boss...

42:42.668 --> 42:45.906
and eliminate one father from my enquiries.

42:45.937 --> 42:50.485
I have to say, Bridget,
I'm actually excited by this next guest.

42:50.546 --> 42:55.625
Relevant, relatable, extremely fuckable.
Good work.

42:55.664 --> 42:59.177
Welcome to CSI Hard News.

43:08.488 --> 43:11.254
Thank you my love. If you could
just fuck off that'd be great.

43:17.413 --> 43:19.657
Jack, this is Cathy. She'll get you ready.

43:19.776 --> 43:24.090
Hi, Cathy, nice to meet you.
-I was thinking, just a simple magenta eyeshadow...

43:24.093 --> 43:27.291
to make your eyes pop
and a little bit of rouge, maybe?

43:27.607 --> 43:30.941
Kidding.
- You funny.

43:30.950 --> 43:33.993
You do happen to have
a little stray gray hair.

43:34.033 --> 43:37.255
Oh, Jesus.
- That's it.

43:37.271 --> 43:40.211
Actually, there's a whole gray patch.
Shall I just... let me see?

43:40.227 --> 43:44.424
Yes, my hair is full of gray hair.
- Well, that's sorted.

43:44.472 --> 43:48.539
Jesus Christ.
- All gone, that's lovely.

43:49.354 --> 43:54.211
These fingernails on this silver fox could
do with a bit of a trim, couldn't they?

43:54.358 --> 43:57.934
These hands haven't experienced
much manual labour, have they?

43:58.169 --> 44:01.374
No, I'm a mathematician.
- They're silky soft.

44:01.414 --> 44:06.259
Tell me, Jack. Do you happen
to like Chinese food?

44:07.508 --> 44:12.298
Jack, let me take you to the set.
Great, thank you. I do sometimes. Thank you.

44:12.330 --> 44:15.954
I don't think she put any makeup on me.
- It's fine. You're looking radiant.

44:19.482 --> 44:22.633
Ok, coming out of ET in five, four...
And remember the gear change.

44:22.650 --> 44:26.938
And Miranda, cue.
- Now, though, I'm joined by Jack Qwant.

44:26.954 --> 44:32.107
Raised by a single mother in Baltimore,
he created the matchmaking website Qwantify...

44:32.138 --> 44:35.511
and he claims to have found
an algorithm for love.

44:35.535 --> 44:40.415
And he's here today to tell us all about his
number one bestseller Qwantum Leap '.

44:40.439 --> 44:45.875
It is absolutely wonderful to have you on our sofa today.
- Thank you. It's great to be here.

44:46.997 --> 44:51.888
Now, we'll talk all about your new book soon, obviously.
- Yes. But first let's talk about romance.

44:51.912 --> 44:54.315
Qwantify has found
true love for millions.

44:54.339 --> 44:56.578
Monitor two.
- Does it work for you?

44:56.594 --> 44:59.439
Now if I answer that can we
go back and talk about the book?

44:59.449 --> 45:00.454
Maybe.

45:00.469 --> 45:03.188
Can you please try not
to shag him on air?

45:03.211 --> 45:05.526
This is dynamite.
Tell her to flirt with him more.

45:05.547 --> 45:09.984
Some people had their first
crush on Farrah Fawcett.

45:10.000 --> 45:12.582
My first crush was an algorithm.
- And we've lost him.

45:12.605 --> 45:17.454
If he carries on talking about algorithms I'm
putting to the VT of cats who look like Hitler.

45:17.478 --> 45:18.560
Back to four. Love it.

45:18.576 --> 45:21.388
He's avoiding the question.
Get him off maths.

45:21.408 --> 45:23.565
Ask him if he's with someone now.

45:23.677 --> 45:27.624
For someone so good at match-making...

45:27.759 --> 45:30.421
is there a special someone in your life?

45:30.429 --> 45:34.921
Apart from Lady Mary on 'Downton Abbey'?
Now can we go ahead and talk about the book?

45:34.952 --> 45:36.990
Cue the Hitler cats.
- Don't be evasive.

45:37.190 --> 45:38.390
Well, don't be evasive.

45:38.521 --> 45:43.087
It's apparant you have everything.
Why have you chosen to have no family?

45:43.099 --> 45:45.818
Why the decision to have no family?
- No children.

45:46.479 --> 45:47.898
And no children?

45:48.546 --> 45:50.387
Brilliant. Zoom in on four.

45:50.406 --> 45:51.839
And in on four.
- Love it.

45:52.117 --> 45:53.942
Look, I love kids...

45:53.966 --> 45:58.974
but I've always found the idea of being
a father myself kind of petrifying.

45:59.122 --> 46:02.942
Which is why I've been drawn to algorithms.
- Cue the Hitler cats.

46:03.305 --> 46:08.740
They're rational, reliable,
predictable, everything a kid isn't.

46:09.030 --> 46:11.814
So, can you have children?
- Can you have children, though?

46:11.942 --> 46:16.991
Are the soldiers working?
- Are the soldiers working?

46:19.871 --> 46:25.598
Well I believe so.
The barracks are in pretty regular use.

46:25.762 --> 46:27.668
Really? - Really?
- Yes.

46:27.691 --> 46:30.750
Because for someone with a
supposed algorithm for love...

46:30.765 --> 46:33.083
Isn't it odd that you've never found it?

46:33.257 --> 46:36.955
Well, I think in order to find something
you have to be actively looking for it.

46:36.963 --> 46:39.274
I've just been too busy; I haven't...

46:39.298 --> 46:43.595
What about the Qwant family bloodline?
- And what about the Qwant family bloodline?

46:43.619 --> 46:48.379
Are there any skeletons in the closet?
- Sexual deviants? - Sexual deviants?

46:48.399 --> 46:52.254
Sorry, I don't know where
we're going with all of this...

46:52.269 --> 46:55.618
but I have to tell you, I can attract
the wrong type of women.

46:56.495 --> 46:59.955
That's really great.
Thank you for sharing that with us.

47:02.312 --> 47:05.258
Bridget, what are you doing?

47:05.282 --> 47:08.021
You wouldn't believe some of the
weirdos that cross my path.

47:08.029 --> 47:09.848
Really?
- Get up.

47:09.864 --> 47:12.141
Can you tell me what she's doing?

47:12.164 --> 47:16.288
Ask him something about algorithms.
- Have to be the last question. Have to be.

47:16.319 --> 47:20.920
Lastly, algorithms.
- Yes.

47:20.935 --> 47:24.063
What first attracted you to them?
- The logic and...

47:24.075 --> 47:27.056
Wonderful, Jack Qwant,
thank you for coming on my sofa.

47:27.079 --> 47:29.945
I hope you've had as much fun as I have.
- Jesus.

47:29.948 --> 47:32.202
That's it from me. Goodbye.

47:34.226 --> 47:38.555
That was great.
- You look really familier, outside of being on the show.

47:38.571 --> 47:40.508
Are you on Tinder?
- What?

47:40.532 --> 47:42.502
Then we won't have met.
- No, okay.

47:47.955 --> 47:51.059
Well hey, how about seeing you here.
- Hi.

47:51.098 --> 47:53.619
Great to see you.
- Good to see you too.

47:53.635 --> 47:59.340
I was going to come and find you to say hello,
but you know how live TV can be, so chaotic.

47:59.363 --> 48:03.689
Well, you know, there are easier ways to get in touch
with me without inviting me on national TV...

48:03.713 --> 48:08.072
and asking me about my sperm.
- What? No, that's not what...

48:08.222 --> 48:10.573
I would've liked to have heard from you.

48:11.142 --> 48:15.201
I was disappointed when I came
back that morning, and you were gone.

48:15.311 --> 48:18.247
You were?
- We had an amazing night.

48:19.492 --> 48:22.958
And I thought you were great.
At least I did until I became a clip...

48:22.967 --> 48:26.436
of the 15 most embarrassing chat
show moments of all time.

48:27.220 --> 48:30.217
Really sorry about that. Yes that...

48:31.904 --> 48:35.296
I don't know how to explain.

48:41.500 --> 48:45.956
I'm pregnant.
- Wow. Okay.

48:46.558 --> 48:50.785
It's so much better than you
being mentally unbalanced.

48:51.419 --> 48:55.385
I'm about twelve weeks.

48:58.376 --> 49:00.941
Oh. Right. Wow.

49:02.915 --> 49:06.282
So you mean that... it's the music festival?
- Yes.

49:07.135 --> 49:12.765
I know, it's quite a surprise.
Yes but...

49:13.344 --> 49:17.215
I'm fine, and umm...
you should know that...

49:17.239 --> 49:21.422
I don't... I'm not looking for
anything from you.

49:21.449 --> 49:25.483
Except for a complete DNA check and a
review of my medical records.

49:25.721 --> 49:31.420
Well, the thing is, I didn't mean
for you to find out about this.

49:31.434 --> 49:35.821
And, umm, I'm feeling a bit foolish.

49:35.852 --> 49:39.508
Mortified, actually. Yes, mortified.

49:39.533 --> 49:45.315
I'd like to just retreat, gracefully?

49:45.370 --> 49:48.122
Mr. Qwant, will you sign my book?

49:48.733 --> 49:53.743
Oh God. I didn't even tell him that he
may not be the only daddy.

49:53.758 --> 49:55.384
Christina.
- I find this amazing book.

49:55.416 --> 49:58.119
Hey, Kitty Kirk, I need to talk to you.

49:59.500 --> 50:04.250
What if this DNA turns out to be Jack's?
I don't want the father to be Jack.

50:04.439 --> 50:08.171
I don't even know Jack.
And what if it's Mark Darcy's?

50:08.195 --> 50:12.310
Christ. I'll have to confess to him that
I've been a whore with dolphin condoms.

50:12.347 --> 50:13.347
Good.

50:13.620 --> 50:15.852
So the baby's ok?
- Perfect.

50:17.176 --> 50:21.781
See?
- Oh my God. Is that it?

50:27.333 --> 50:31.621
And it's alright?
- Sound as a bell. Cooking Nicely.

50:32.296 --> 50:33.391
Have a listen.

50:39.937 --> 50:41.074
There you are.

50:41.618 --> 50:45.030
I've  recorded that for you.
You can watch that for a moment.

50:46.882 --> 50:49.839
So glad you decided
on the amniocentesis.

50:52.387 --> 50:53.887
Hello you.

50:55.538 --> 51:01.239
Is that your ear or your foot?
You have got very big feet.

51:02.760 --> 51:07.222
Oh, look at you.
Waving already.

51:12.976 --> 51:15.146
You're the best thing I've ever seen.

51:19.358 --> 51:22.769
I promise I'll try my best.

51:23.648 --> 51:28.170
So just stay safe and snug in there...

51:28.862 --> 51:33.029
while I try and sort the mess out here.
And hopefully...

51:34.925 --> 51:39.244
What the fuck is that?
- It's the amniocentesis needle.

51:39.271 --> 51:43.085
We just pop it in, take a little amniotic
fluid, test it for any abnormalities...

51:43.109 --> 51:45.216
and also the DNA sample that you require.

51:45.232 --> 51:49.386
Now, there is the slightest risk of miscarriage
so you'll have to stay very still indeed...

51:49.410 --> 51:51.967
because we don't want the needle to come into contact...
- What?

51:52.125 --> 51:55.366
No, no. I'm not taking that chance.

51:55.398 --> 51:58.893
It's enormous.
It'd go straight through the other side.

51:58.909 --> 52:01.731
Come on, I'm taking you home.

52:06.215 --> 52:10.320
Your mother will be over the moon.
- Will you promise not to tell her?

52:10.625 --> 52:14.200
Just not yet.
- No, of course. I promise.

52:14.692 --> 52:19.019
I'm really sorry, dad, not
to know about the father.

52:19.039 --> 52:21.387
Don't be daft.

52:21.407 --> 52:26.038
I know dozens of people who could have been anybodys.
- So you're not disappointed?

52:26.483 --> 52:31.384
You don't think I belong on Jerry Springer?
- Not a bit, I'm thrilled.

52:32.543 --> 52:37.641
Actually I'm not sure if you're mine or that nice
lieutenant colonel who's 'round the bowls club.

52:39.583 --> 52:40.793
Only joking.

52:41.182 --> 52:44.701
You've got my feet.
I've always had very dainty feet.

52:47.414 --> 52:52.362
Just tell the truth, Bridget.
You can't go too far wrong, telling the truth.

53:03.681 --> 53:09.638
Mark, I have some exciting news.
Mark, I have the funniest story to tell you.

53:09.775 --> 53:12.392
Mark, I'm up the duff.

53:12.416 --> 53:14.261
My lords, my ladies.

53:14.603 --> 53:17.940
There is only one fraud committed
here today and it is this.

53:17.999 --> 53:22.721
To use the laws of one country to destroy
the freedom of speech of another.

53:23.070 --> 53:27.304
A cynical political expedient to take away
the right of these brave young women...

53:27.320 --> 53:30.473
to speak the truth about
the country they love.

53:31.281 --> 53:37.198
Now you may not like their
music and for that I cannot blame you.

53:37.245 --> 53:43.228
They may not have mastered the fundamentals of melody...
or even the most basic tenents of musicianship.

53:43.244 --> 53:47.848
but this is the land of Shakespeare,
Orwell, Lawrence ...

53:47.886 --> 53:51.693
I'd forgotten just how hot
he is in that wig and gown.

53:51.702 --> 53:56.688
... to any country, any ruler,
any despot, that here in the United Kingdom...

53:56.696 --> 54:01.760
we will always defend and protect
women such as these who have selflessly and courageously...

54:01.776 --> 54:04.708
risked their liberty and
quite possibly their lives...

54:06.706 --> 54:07.920
to tell the truth.

54:08.388 --> 54:11.691
The court will now adjourn
and judgement will be given...

54:11.699 --> 54:15.840
Poonani! Poonani! Power to the Poonani!
Power to the Poonani! - Christ.

54:16.162 --> 54:19.240
Looking forward to going back
to some good old fashioned genocide.

54:19.320 --> 54:20.450
Order.

54:27.920 --> 54:30.327
Right. How to do this?

54:30.351 --> 54:33.271
I didn't expect to see you again
after the events at the christening.

54:33.287 --> 54:34.790
Crap. He's dived right in.

54:34.814 --> 54:39.506
No, right. I understand.
Maybe flattery will work.

54:39.514 --> 54:42.126
You were very impressive in there today.
- Thank you.

54:43.173 --> 54:46.646
Although dealing with them over the last
month has given me a certain amount of sympathy...

54:46.670 --> 54:49.775
for the totalitarian dictator who
wants to silence them.

54:50.648 --> 54:54.197
Okay, jokes.
I'll laugh harder next time.

54:54.261 --> 54:57.067
There's only a certain number of
times that one can listen to the...

54:57.202 --> 55:01.327
resolutely un-catchy "Menstruation,
Castration, Liberation."

55:02.747 --> 55:07.108
Mark, that's hilariously funny.

55:13.264 --> 55:14.264
Please.

55:23.645 --> 55:27.809
So.
- So, Mark.

55:27.836 --> 55:28.840
Yes.

55:31.033 --> 55:35.585
The gardens look lovely. Autumnal.
- Yes.

55:35.696 --> 55:38.625
Is that a conker tree?
- Bridget.

55:44.509 --> 55:48.217
I am pregnant.

55:51.180 --> 55:54.863
Right. Well, congratulations.

55:56.375 --> 55:57.446
How can I help?

55:59.090 --> 56:01.011
I'm three months pregnant.

56:03.211 --> 56:04.211
Oh.

56:06.361 --> 56:07.668
You mean the christening?

56:09.711 --> 56:10.711
Yes.

56:14.539 --> 56:16.173
Would you excuse me for just a moment.

56:39.272 --> 56:41.783
I think that this is quite
possibly the most wonderful

56:41.883 --> 56:44.383
piece of information I have
ever received in my entire life.

56:45.883 --> 56:46.883
Oh!

56:48.083 --> 56:49.083
Ok.

56:50.032 --> 56:54.695
Of course I've got no expectations about how things
should work out. I just thought you should know.

56:55.088 --> 56:56.216
No, of course.

56:58.705 --> 57:03.223
I mean, how do you feel? Are you happy?
- Yes, I am.

57:03.255 --> 57:07.691
So much has happened in the past ten years.
A lot has changed.

57:07.699 --> 57:11.111
I mean, you've been married,
and I've been...

57:11.237 --> 57:15.250
on a number of long haul holidays.

57:15.266 --> 57:17.680
But... So here goes on Jack.

57:17.704 --> 57:19.668
I mean...
- I know about it.

57:20.885 --> 57:24.213
It's just right now I can't bring
myself to feel gloomy about it.

57:37.400 --> 57:41.371
God, how can I tell him now.

57:45.460 --> 57:49.922
State of emergency. Cannot sleep.
Looping thoughts going round and round in head.

57:49.938 --> 57:53.435
It's surely weird that tou can do
something as complicated and important...

57:53.450 --> 57:56.791
as growing a baby or invading
Iraq without any instruction at all.

57:56.946 --> 57:59.403
I keep thinking all the alcohol
I've drunk over the years...

57:59.424 --> 58:01.489
will give the baby
fetal alcohol syndrome.

58:01.505 --> 58:03.184
These are the things I could do.

58:03.467 --> 58:04.853
Tell Mark about Jack...

58:04.873 --> 58:07.647
but risk hurting him so badly
I couldn't live with myself.

58:07.740 --> 58:11.445
Not tell Mark about Jack,
but I'd never be able to go through with it.

58:11.453 --> 58:16.293
Tell both of them the other one is the father and then
if the one who isn't the father is upset about it...

58:18.532 --> 58:22.001
Oh Christ.
Tell no-one and make a run for it.

58:23.155 --> 58:26.359
Hello?
- Hey, it's the father of your child.

58:27.285 --> 58:29.718
Jack?
- Yeah, who else?

58:30.809 --> 58:31.896
Come up.
Ok.

58:37.390 --> 58:42.624
Oh fuckfuckfuck. He's probably employed a team of
Google Earth detectives to find me.

58:43.148 --> 58:45.818
Okay, just act naturally.

58:50.918 --> 58:51.918
Hi.

58:52.118 --> 58:53.118
Hi.

58:53.588 --> 58:55.739
Come in.
- Okay.

59:00.028 --> 59:03.324
You found it.
- Try it on, see if it fits.

59:06.295 --> 59:07.300
Wow.

59:09.779 --> 59:13.733
I didn't expect to see you.
- I wasn't expecting to come.

59:14.059 --> 59:17.758
I'm not used to being rejected. Twice.

59:19.930 --> 59:22.757
I hope you've got cake in that bag.

59:29.286 --> 59:31.183
Yeah, I've been doing a lot of thinking.

59:33.071 --> 59:39.027
Bridget, the whole baby situation threw me initially.
We've squashed an entire relationship into one night...

59:39.049 --> 59:42.212
and skipped straight
to starting a family phase.

59:42.573 --> 59:45.515
We never even had a real second date.

59:47.445 --> 59:52.324
Just so you know if we did,
I would have taken you to Ottolenghi.

59:52.451 --> 59:56.597
You would have had the grilled
salmon and pine nuts salsa.

59:56.732 --> 01:00:02.282
Unbelievable and healthy.
And we would have come back here...

01:00:02.877 --> 01:00:05.004
have incredible sex...

01:00:05.028 --> 01:00:09.729
spent the next couple of days
sending each other filthy texts.

01:00:21.151 --> 01:00:24.313
I would not have let you
do that on a second date.

01:00:24.329 --> 01:00:26.850
Why not. You let me on the first.

01:00:26.866 --> 01:00:31.029
And then we'd go on a
naughty weekend to the seaside...

01:00:31.045 --> 01:00:35.444
and I would prove my manliness by
winning you a cuddly toy...

01:00:36.417 --> 01:00:37.433
at the pier.

01:00:37.655 --> 01:00:40.942
I really wanted the giant Scooby-Doo.
- Oh, no-body wins that.

01:00:40.967 --> 01:00:42.514
The coconuts are glued on.

01:00:51.943 --> 01:00:54.670
What are those for?
- To apologise.

01:00:55.133 --> 01:00:56.640
We had our first fight.

01:00:57.412 --> 01:01:02.275
I was not flirting with that waitress.
She means nothing to me.

01:01:07.435 --> 01:01:11.250
And then I would have...

01:01:11.528 --> 01:01:15.551
bought Swedish
furniture for us to make.

01:01:16.359 --> 01:01:21.450
If we can get through this, we can get through anything.
- Anything.

01:01:22.754 --> 01:01:26.361
I find it adorable how your neck gets
all blotchy when you get nervous.

01:01:26.567 --> 01:01:29.847
And I know you'd be the greatest
possible mother to my child.

01:02:03.113 --> 01:02:07.182
Oh no, can not fall in love
with shiny new American.

01:02:07.230 --> 01:02:10.098
I'll tell them both tomorrow, definitely.

01:02:12.047 --> 01:02:17.068
Hi. I just wanted to connect, check how
the presentation is shaping up.

01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:20.678
Yeah, totally on top of it,
Neutra Bulleting the shit out of it.

01:02:20.693 --> 01:02:24.178
I'm relying on you, Bridget.
I need you to get this right. Understand?

01:02:24.209 --> 01:02:28.313
100 percent. You can count on me.
- Great.

01:02:33.538 --> 01:02:37.365
You alright?
- I'm fine.

01:02:37.540 --> 01:02:41.936
Big party.
I'm so glad to see you back together.

01:02:41.951 --> 01:02:44.574
It certainly is Gianni.
- Wonderful news, huh?

01:02:44.590 --> 01:02:45.599
Cheers.

01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:51.255
I was thinking about Jack.
If it's a boy, after my grandfather.

01:02:51.271 --> 01:02:54.759
It's a good strong name.
You can rely on Jack.

01:02:54.862 --> 01:02:57.085
Yes, one for the list.

01:02:57.100 --> 01:02:58.989
To Jack.
- To Jack.

01:03:01.434 --> 01:03:03.046
So this is dad, I presume.

01:03:03.070 --> 01:03:06.757
So glad you're here.
It's a unique and wonderful moment.

01:03:06.773 --> 01:03:11.356
Dr. Rawlings, I wonder if you
could maybe do me a little favor.

01:03:13.375 --> 01:03:17.189
So this is dad, I presume.
Pleased to meet you.

01:03:17.332 --> 01:03:23.520
I'm so glad you could be here.
This is a unique and wonderful moment.

01:03:23.536 --> 01:03:27.567
Before we start, would you like to know the sex?
- We should be prepared.

01:03:27.583 --> 01:03:29.499
I'm not sure...
- It's a boy.

01:03:29.830 --> 01:03:33.093
A boy.
- Our boy.

01:03:35.098 --> 01:03:36.670
My boy.

01:03:38.943 --> 01:03:43.754
Okay, right. This time I have to tell them.
We'll start with Jack.

01:03:43.770 --> 01:03:48.600
Have invited him for big scary work
presentation and will explain all afterwards.

01:03:51.199 --> 01:03:52.201
Welcome.

01:03:52.662 --> 01:03:58.423
In a digital age where every cell phone
is a camera, we are all broadcasters.

01:03:58.431 --> 01:04:01.430
"Hard News"
is partnering with the London Media Show...

01:04:01.453 --> 01:04:07.777
so you can use your smartphone
to create your own news broadcasting channel.

01:04:07.793 --> 01:04:13.292
Simply download the new 'Hard News'
app and broadcast directly to our studios in...

01:04:13.308 --> 01:04:18.261
where Miranda is waiting for
our first ever live simulcast.

01:04:18.269 --> 01:04:22.798
Hello everyone,
live at the London MediaShow.

01:04:22.814 --> 01:04:27.927
And welcome to the new look of
'Hard News' studio.

01:04:28.030 --> 01:04:33.253
We are live and yes,
our viewers are broadcasting.

01:04:33.554 --> 01:04:36.817
Right. Let's now go to the Grampians...

01:04:36.833 --> 01:04:42.777
where Adam Wollaston is leading a team of
Venture Rangers to the top of Ben Nevis.

01:04:43.420 --> 01:04:48.528
Hello, Adam Wollaston.
- 'Hard News' sucks balls.

01:04:51.254 --> 01:04:53.437
Jesus.
- Oh dear.

01:04:53.453 --> 01:04:56.858
Well, let's put that news
story firmly behind us.

01:05:05.191 --> 01:05:06.738
Technical glitch.

01:05:10.127 --> 01:05:14.989
Of course it's never been easier
to email or text the show.

01:05:15.020 --> 01:05:20.761
Just search
"Hard News" or simply H.

01:05:20.834 --> 01:05:22.105
Because...

01:05:23.405 --> 01:05:25.305
Be...cause...

01:05:25.555 --> 01:05:28.173
Holy fuck. What's he doing here?

01:05:28.189 --> 01:05:32.751
Because at 'Hard News', we believe...

01:05:34.140 --> 01:05:38.585
We believe that we are ready
and on the front line...

01:05:38.601 --> 01:05:42.816
asking the questions
the world wants answers to.

01:05:49.576 --> 01:05:50.600
Turn around.

01:06:02.091 --> 01:06:06.289
Thank you. Okay.
Career down the toilet.

01:06:06.313 --> 01:06:10.960
Both men in the same room.
What could possibly go wrong?

01:06:14.837 --> 01:06:17.566
I hope you don't mind me just
showing up and surprising you.

01:06:17.739 --> 01:06:20.631
No.
- Well done. It was very...

01:06:21.856 --> 01:06:24.886
Yes.
- Technically adroit.

01:06:25.489 --> 01:06:29.752
Mark, I would love for you to meet...

01:06:37.356 --> 01:06:41.876
Ariyaratna Sithamparanathan.

01:06:41.896 --> 01:06:48.003
Ariyaratna's is the area manager
for DTC Technological Solutions.

01:06:48.019 --> 01:06:50.866
Aren't you, Ari Sinatra?

01:06:54.383 --> 01:06:55.984
Hi.
- Hello.

01:06:56.384 --> 01:06:57.384
Hey.

01:06:59.248 --> 01:07:02.656
What the hell was that?
What'ere you thinking?

01:07:02.679 --> 01:07:06.134
I've got four voicemails from David
Cartwright that I dare not listen to.

01:07:06.158 --> 01:07:08.912
I'll be right back.
- You call that a presentation?

01:07:08.931 --> 01:07:11.792
I don't know whether I've the right people
around me because you're not...

01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:14.322
Alice, I'm so sorry.
Yeah well sorry isn't good enough.

01:07:14.338 --> 01:07:19.263
Excuse me. Look at me when I'm talking to you. Excuse me.
- I'm so sorry, but I really...

01:07:20.696 --> 01:07:21.696
What?

01:07:22.789 --> 01:07:25.651
Bridget, I'd like you to meet Jack Qwant.
He's rather extraordinary.

01:07:25.666 --> 01:07:29.209
I was just reading a profile of him in The New Yorker.
- Right, yes.

01:07:29.225 --> 01:07:31.875
We actually know each other.
Yes, we certainly do.

01:07:31.899 --> 01:07:34.100
Good job.
Why didn't you introduce me to this man before?

01:07:34.116 --> 01:07:37.473
He's brilliant. You know, he represents the
punk rock band that's being extradited.

01:07:37.489 --> 01:07:40.111
That's right.
- Yes. Yes. I knew that too.

01:07:40.135 --> 01:07:43.533
Hi, we've met fleetingly before as well.

01:07:43.556 --> 01:07:46.245
I'm in charge of data management
for most of Daventry.

01:07:47.145 --> 01:07:49.045
Oh. Well, umm...

01:07:49.306 --> 01:07:54.501
I must say it's fantastic that you're getting
on so well because you have a lot in common.

01:07:54.685 --> 01:08:00.679
Shall we get out of here, and find a place a bit quieter?
- Yes, why not. I booked Gianni's.

01:08:00.695 --> 01:08:03.075
Great.
- That sounds lovely.

01:08:04.895 --> 01:08:10.045
You might have to sit this
one out, Arinuth. I'm sorry.

01:08:16.087 --> 01:08:20.398
So do you actually believe that mathematics can...
how did you put it in your book?

01:08:20.412 --> 01:08:23.542
help us analyze behavior
previously invisible to science?

01:08:23.559 --> 01:08:28.424
Well, my dating algorithm is to help people
find love, not necessarily replace it.

01:08:28.439 --> 01:08:33.207
Oh no, is incredible idea.
- Have you ever tried it out?

01:08:34.879 --> 01:08:40.178
You're single, right?
- Well, I'm... Yes, I suppose so.

01:08:41.234 --> 01:08:43.303
How did you two meet?

01:08:47.787 --> 01:08:50.957
Yeah.
- It's umm...

01:08:52.366 --> 01:08:56.064
It's sort of a funny story.
Sort of.

01:08:58.442 --> 01:08:59.442
You see, umm...

01:08:59.642 --> 01:09:05.053
a few months ago, on the fourth
of the month, I met Jack at a music festival.

01:09:05.073 --> 01:09:06.073
Right.

01:09:06.093 --> 01:09:12.268
And we got on very well
and sort of had... relations.

01:09:12.292 --> 01:09:18.720
And the next week, that is to say, on the eleventh
of the month at Jude's baby christening to be exact...

01:09:18.745 --> 01:09:24.684
following the consumption of a large amount of
alcohol, Mark and I, well, we had similar relations.

01:09:25.383 --> 01:09:31.310
And, um, this is the funny part, I suppose.
Owing to these relations...

01:09:31.334 --> 01:09:37.095
the resulting life form currently residing in my tummy,
could actually, in fact, be either of yours.

01:09:46.719 --> 01:09:52.774
I know I should have told you both
before but... I just didn't.

01:09:55.145 --> 01:09:56.855
You both seemed so happy.

01:09:57.178 --> 01:10:01.073
So correct me if I'm wrong, but did you just
say that the baby could be either of us?

01:10:04.533 --> 01:10:08.726
So you have no idea which
of us is actually the father?

01:10:12.318 --> 01:10:17.411
I know, it's all very confusing.
I'm sorry.

01:10:18.011 --> 01:10:19.111
I'm sorry.

01:10:19.857 --> 01:10:25.065
So however we choose to do this...

01:10:27.695 --> 01:10:31.319
the most important thing now is this.

01:10:35.068 --> 01:10:37.648
Bridget, I'm not going to
pretend this isn't a shock.

01:10:39.067 --> 01:10:43.075
I want you to know whatever the circumstance...

01:10:44.285 --> 01:10:46.412
The most important thing is the baby.

01:10:47.641 --> 01:10:50.176
Who knows, this could be a great adventure.

01:10:50.646 --> 01:10:54.101
I'm afraid you're going to have to excuse me.
I have a meeting.

01:10:59.155 --> 01:11:01.574
Good night
- Mark...

01:11:08.764 --> 01:11:11.736
Gianni, can we have the bill please?
- Subito.

01:11:20.382 --> 01:11:22.300
And if I thought that was tricky...

01:11:22.323 --> 01:11:26.315
how would the news go down at mum's
parish council election campaign?

01:11:26.481 --> 01:11:29.624
Honestly, we started half an hour ago.
Where have you been?

01:11:29.648 --> 01:11:33.552
You said it was an emergency.
Well, The Gazette wants to take a family portrait.

01:11:33.576 --> 01:11:34.657
What are you wearing?

01:11:36.336 --> 01:11:38.917
Oh my God. Bridget, you're...
- Yes.

01:11:41.513 --> 01:11:46.382
Why didn't you say anything?
- I didn't want to upset you.

01:11:46.403 --> 01:11:51.278
Why would you?
Oh no, Bridget. Who's the father?

01:11:51.487 --> 01:11:56.176
It's not Mark is it? Oh, do say it is.
- There's at least a 50 percent chance.

01:11:56.192 --> 01:12:00.151
A 50 percent chance?
- Mark and this really nice American called Jack.

01:12:00.175 --> 01:12:04.453
Oh no, Bridget. An American?
Did you have a three-way?

01:12:04.726 --> 01:12:06.321
Mrs Jones.

01:12:08.250 --> 01:12:12.899
Here, take this and pretend everything is fine.
- Everything is fine.

01:12:12.930 --> 01:12:17.924
Ms. Jones, can we...
Here's a lovely place for you to stand.

01:12:21.059 --> 01:12:25.225
Are you ashamed of me?
- No darling. It's just the circumstances.

01:12:25.241 --> 01:12:27.695
I'm running for high office.
See?

01:12:28.596 --> 01:12:32.275
If you love family and you
love values... it's so long.

01:12:32.661 --> 01:12:35.437
It's not the 1950's.

01:12:35.651 --> 01:12:40.578
Look around you.
Two lesbians just adopted at number 32.

01:12:41.079 --> 01:12:45.370
If you don't change the way you look at things,
you're going to lose your precious election...

01:12:45.786 --> 01:12:47.527
and perhaps your daughter.

01:12:49.971 --> 01:12:52.707
Bridget, so lovely to see you.

01:12:52.889 --> 01:12:55.195
Are you...?
- Yes, I am.

01:12:55.319 --> 01:12:59.726
How wonderful.
We thought you'd just got all fat again.

01:13:02.943 --> 01:13:08.157
I'm now the Mary Magdalene of middle England.
Have alienated Mom and Mark Darcy.

01:13:08.159 --> 01:13:12.441
Am like tropical female insect that shags
men to impregnate self and eats them.

01:13:12.487 --> 01:13:17.319
The question is: will Mark even turn up
and engage in a polyamorous family?

01:13:25.937 --> 01:13:27.437
Hey.
Hello.

01:13:27.537 --> 01:13:30.020
First pre-natal class.

01:13:30.753 --> 01:13:33.011
Exciting, huh?
- Yeah.

01:13:34.859 --> 01:13:36.611
You look great.

01:13:43.195 --> 01:13:44.931
Hello.

01:13:45.943 --> 01:13:49.217
I'm so glad you came.
- Yeah, me too.

01:13:49.403 --> 01:13:52.776
I brought you a nice tea.
- Oh, wow. Thank you.

01:13:54.951 --> 01:13:59.693
It's off 'till this evening. But there's
a heck of a lot of caffeine in that tea.

01:13:59.703 --> 01:14:03.426
I brought you a... super juice.

01:14:04.535 --> 01:14:09.194
Thank you.
Shall we go in?

01:14:09.196 --> 01:14:11.585
Why not?
- Sure. Let me carry that for you.

01:14:11.587 --> 01:14:14.777
Thank you.
- Can I carry your phone, please?

01:14:15.977 --> 01:14:16.977
Okay.

01:14:18.911 --> 01:14:20.159
Thank you.

01:14:21.079 --> 01:14:23.119
And who do we have here, then?

01:14:23.243 --> 01:14:27.867
I'm Bridget and this is Jack ...

01:14:27.995 --> 01:14:31.370
and this is Mark.

01:14:32.370 --> 01:14:38.513
Oh. Lovely.
You're our second same sex couple today.

01:14:41.287 --> 01:14:44.471
No, actually we're ...
- Absolutely.

01:14:44.473 --> 01:14:48.281
We just need the gift of a baby
to make us feel complete.

01:14:48.367 --> 01:14:51.923
You must be the surrogate?
- Exactly, yes.

01:14:51.925 --> 01:14:55.203
Just helping this wonderful couple
make their dream come true.

01:14:55.205 --> 01:14:59.768
Mark is very nervous about all this.
All new to you, isn't it, lamb chop?

01:15:02.327 --> 01:15:05.867
Like all visionaries,
we encounter bumps along the road.

01:15:05.995 --> 01:15:10.294
How would you like to give birth to your placenta?
- Quickly.

01:15:35.159 --> 01:15:36.838
Are you okay? Are you sure?

01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:41.414
And of course massage can have
many benefits throughout pregnancy.

01:15:41.416 --> 01:15:45.479
Can we name some of them?
- It relieves stress and promotes feel good hormones.

01:15:45.481 --> 01:15:48.028
And is also to be avoided in
cases of high risk pregnancy...

01:15:48.048 --> 01:15:50.183
For example, when there is a geriatric mother.

01:15:50.203 --> 01:15:53.414
Right, excellent, someone's been reading up.

01:15:53.416 --> 01:15:56.750
Would you like to have a go?
- No, I think I'll let Jack get on with it....

01:15:56.752 --> 01:15:59.435
I think he seems to have it covered.
- That's very sweet of you.

01:15:59.437 --> 01:16:01.653
That's why I love you, my little teacup.

01:16:03.995 --> 01:16:07.367
What if we ask the right questions
and apply the laws of mathematics...

01:16:07.495 --> 01:16:10.495
so that the science of courtship
could be quantified?

01:17:06.827 --> 01:17:10.151
May I please make an application to lead to an appeal...

01:17:10.153 --> 01:17:14.480
in the case of Her Majesty's
Government and Saddiq Al Bashir.

01:17:15.035 --> 01:17:18.144
As Your Lordship is aware,
Mr. Al Bashir has lost.

01:17:18.164 --> 01:17:22.400
So everything's alright?
- Yes, well, it's this combination...

01:17:22.402 --> 01:17:26.743
gherkins, anchovies, banana juice and Pringles.

01:17:27.203 --> 01:17:30.429
So essentially...
- It's wind.

01:17:32.234 --> 01:17:38.411
Right, so, going forward regular Pringles,
not hot, spicy barbecue?

01:17:38.413 --> 01:17:41.632
Or possibly no Pringles at all. Try that.

01:17:44.979 --> 01:17:48.539
Is everything alright? Is Bridget okay?
- Yes, perfectly fine.

01:17:49.103 --> 01:17:54.603
She's in there with... That's Dr. Pringle.
He's testing her blood. This is interesting.

01:17:54.605 --> 01:17:58.457
This is a new bedside technique we're testing out of Oslo.
It's Norwegian.

01:17:58.459 --> 01:18:02.237
It's alright. I know about Jack. Thank you doctor.
- Oh, thank God. Why didn't you tell me?

01:18:02.355 --> 01:18:05.147
She's fine. He's calmed her
down completely, actually.

01:18:05.563 --> 01:18:08.703
I'm sorry, I got your messages.
I was in court.

01:18:11.979 --> 01:18:15.458
Hi. It's alright.
Can't be helped.

01:18:19.311 --> 01:18:22.395
You should get it.
It might be work.

01:18:25.355 --> 01:18:28.855
Don't worry. I got it covered.
- Yes, I can see that.

01:18:29.855 --> 01:18:34.777
Wow. Okay, you need to chill out.
We have to do this together.

01:18:34.855 --> 01:18:39.960
You know, in Peru the Um Bat Do, consider paternity
attach shared responsibility among the many tribesmen.

01:18:39.962 --> 01:18:43.111
Unfortunately, we Um Bat don't live in Peru.
I live in Ealing.

01:18:44.771 --> 01:18:47.952
Negative energy is just
so bad for the baby.

01:18:50.227 --> 01:18:54.778
Stop it. Both of you.
This isn't a competition.

01:18:57.147 --> 01:19:01.926
She's right.
We should take this toxic energy out of the room.

01:19:10.435 --> 01:19:11.855
I won't be a minute.

01:19:24.147 --> 01:19:29.468
What's up? Come on, buddy.
Why are you so angry?

01:19:30.687 --> 01:19:32.687
You know what?
I'm really not your buddy.

01:19:32.811 --> 01:19:36.315
I don't know about vibes or negative
energy or prenatal wind...

01:19:36.317 --> 01:19:38.000
and even less about algorithms...

01:19:38.002 --> 01:19:41.349
so I will confess that the laws
of attraction are somewhat beyond me.

01:19:41.687 --> 01:19:44.271
In fact,
Bridget defies comprehension generally.

01:19:44.395 --> 01:19:47.479
But despite, or perhaps owing to the
bewildering litany of catastrophes

01:19:47.603 --> 01:19:50.867
I've witnessed over the last 40 years,
I feel I've come to know Bridget rather well...

01:19:50.869 --> 01:19:52.890
and I've spent those years
caring for her very deeply.

01:19:52.892 --> 01:19:56.109
And that may defy automated reasoning,
but there's nothing I can do about it.

01:19:56.129 --> 01:19:57.303
Nothing you can do about it?

01:19:57.305 --> 01:20:00.587
Maybe you should try and stay around a little,
instead of saving the world by cellphone.

01:20:00.607 --> 01:20:01.918
I make her happy, Mark.

01:20:01.938 --> 01:20:05.102
And I suppose your algorithm tells you
you're destined to be together, does it.

01:20:05.122 --> 01:20:07.683
Actually it does.
The fact that you've been trying

01:20:07.783 --> 01:20:10.183
and failing for the past ten
years tells me you are not.

01:20:10.647 --> 01:20:12.811
No...
- I don't want to fight with you.

01:20:16.103 --> 01:20:17.941
We should think about
Bridget and the baby.

01:20:17.943 --> 01:20:20.639
For better or worse,
fate has brought us together.

01:20:20.641 --> 01:20:24.147
It wasn't fate, it was condoms.
- What do you mean?

01:20:24.271 --> 01:20:27.519
Those ridiculous dolphin friendly things
from the bottom of Bridget's bag.

01:20:28.647 --> 01:20:32.387
I'm sorry, I have no idea what you're talking
about. When Bridget and I got it on, I was...

01:20:32.979 --> 01:20:35.224
I was not dressed for the occasion.

01:21:18.187 --> 01:21:20.147
No Mark today?
- No.

01:21:25.935 --> 01:21:29.502
We must thank one person who
was prepared to fight for us...

01:21:29.504 --> 01:21:32.413
when no one else would,
and we say to that person...

01:21:32.771 --> 01:21:34.147
with all our hearts...

01:21:38.855 --> 01:21:40.979
"Freedom!"

01:21:43.855 --> 01:21:46.227
Bridget, we're back.

01:21:47.771 --> 01:21:51.395
I still can't believe Mark
ducked out like that.

01:21:51.519 --> 01:21:53.435
Well, it's not really his fault.

01:21:53.563 --> 01:21:58.853
I suppose we just have
to hope it's Jack's, right?

01:21:59.311 --> 01:22:04.380
I mean, let's face it, things could be worse.
He's pretty fucking amazing.

01:22:04.382 --> 01:22:07.771
He's richer than God and he
has a very nice sized puppet.

01:22:07.895 --> 01:22:12.647
He does, and we match
up very nicely on paper.

01:22:13.435 --> 01:22:17.013
Well, how do you know?
- You just have to have faith.

01:22:17.015 --> 01:22:22.185
You just have to ask yourself:
can I see myself growing old...

01:22:22.187 --> 01:22:26.126
with this guy, and not Mark Darcy?

01:22:28.479 --> 01:22:31.718
There it is. Here we go.

01:22:38.818 --> 01:22:39.818
Oh, hey!

01:22:41.271 --> 01:22:44.311
You know, first few months,
they only see black and white.

01:22:44.435 --> 01:22:47.187
This will help stimulate spatial awareness.

01:22:47.311 --> 01:22:49.271
Or early onset motion sickness.

01:22:50.895 --> 01:22:54.437
I got him one of these.
A bouncy chair.

01:22:55.979 --> 01:22:58.935
Not quite sure where we're going to put it.

01:23:00.479 --> 01:23:06.114
About that...
It's kind of cramped in here, don't you think?

01:23:08.519 --> 01:23:10.328
It's cosy.

01:23:12.237 --> 01:23:17.885
You know, I've been thinking.
Might be nice if we moved in together.

01:23:18.063 --> 01:23:20.407
You think we're ready for that?

01:23:20.409 --> 01:23:24.860
I'm just tired of living in
hotel rooms and airport lounges.

01:23:25.395 --> 01:23:30.296
We could be a family.
Me, you and him.

01:23:31.395 --> 01:23:33.121
What do you say?

01:23:38.395 --> 01:23:41.435
What if it's not yours?
- What?

01:23:41.563 --> 01:23:44.019
What if the baby turns out to be Mark's?

01:23:49.435 --> 01:23:52.116
Well, I mean, it'd certainly change things.

01:23:56.979 --> 01:23:59.741
Is that what you want?
For it to be Mark's?

01:24:05.603 --> 01:24:07.311
Are you in love with him?

01:24:10.771 --> 01:24:15.076
I have been in the past.

01:24:16.687 --> 01:24:18.103
And me?

01:24:20.355 --> 01:24:23.754
I could be, one day.

01:24:31.979 --> 01:24:36.068
Bridget, I haven't been
totally honest with you.

01:24:37.103 --> 01:24:40.914
Mark thinks the baby isn't his,
and I let him believe it was mine.

01:24:41.519 --> 01:24:43.811
That's why he disappeared.

01:24:47.687 --> 01:24:50.435
Why would he think that?
- Because I let him.

01:24:50.563 --> 01:24:52.603
Because I wanted you for myself.

01:24:56.103 --> 01:24:58.227
We could be so good for each other.

01:25:00.435 --> 01:25:06.535
97 percent.
- On paper.

01:25:07.227 --> 01:25:10.033
But falling in love doesn't happen on paper.

01:25:11.519 --> 01:25:16.578
Sometimes you love a person because
of all the reasons they're not like you.

01:25:19.895 --> 01:25:23.603
And sometimes you love a person
just because they feel like home.

01:25:27.811 --> 01:25:29.727
I've got to find Mark.

01:25:36.271 --> 01:25:41.331
Hello, Pierce. It's Bridget.
I'm trying to get hold of Mark.

01:25:41.333 --> 01:25:44.895
He just got back from a trip, Bridget.
He's in a taxi on his way home.

01:26:19.311 --> 01:26:20.983
Hi.

01:27:04.687 --> 01:27:08.102
Approximately eight weeks to go.

01:27:13.603 --> 01:27:16.278
You don't really need them, you know.

01:27:16.280 --> 01:27:18.445
All they're good for is fitting car seats,
and blaming things on,

01:27:18.445 --> 01:27:20.245
they really just get in the way after that.

01:27:21.479 --> 01:27:25.174
You're absolutely capable of
doing this on your own.

01:27:26.103 --> 01:27:27.933
I did.

01:27:46.835 --> 01:27:52.662
You know what? I can do this on my own.
We can do this on our own.

01:27:53.047 --> 01:27:57.419
One of the perks of being pregnant is I no
longer feel like a tragic lonely spinster.

01:27:57.547 --> 01:28:00.255
Because of a miniature
miracle growing inside.

01:28:00.379 --> 01:28:03.107
Hello.
Hello!

01:28:05.171 --> 01:28:08.463
Mum's throwing a
Christmas party / political rally.

01:28:08.587 --> 01:28:13.702
It's like the G8 summit with Scotch eggs.
Be brave. Go in.

01:28:14.671 --> 01:28:16.379
Hello darling.
- Hello.

01:28:16.503 --> 01:28:20.211
Sorry, I didn't realise everyone was here.
I'll just pop upstairs.

01:28:20.335 --> 01:28:26.542
No, nonsense. Nonsense.
Una's had all the posters reprinted.

01:28:28.465 --> 01:28:30.780
You've inspired me.
- Still so long.

01:28:30.782 --> 01:28:33.304
You were quite right, as it turns out.

01:28:33.306 --> 01:28:37.671
This place is teeming with single mothers,
single fathers, bisexuals, surrogates.

01:28:37.795 --> 01:28:39.879
And they're all lovely and so normal.

01:28:40.003 --> 01:28:43.865
Do you know, I've even got two homosexuals on the team.
- No, thank you.

01:28:43.867 --> 01:28:45.879
Who knew?
- Everybody.

01:28:47.503 --> 01:28:49.671
I'm so proud of you, darling.
You know that?

01:28:50.171 --> 01:28:53.623
What you're doing is not easy,
but if anyone can make it work, it's you.

01:28:54.379 --> 01:28:58.221
That child is the luckiest boy on
earth to have you as his mother.

01:28:58.547 --> 01:29:02.316
And he's going to have the love of
a million fathers with you by his side.

01:29:03.711 --> 01:29:06.623
Come on. We've got some campaigning to do.

01:29:06.625 --> 01:29:10.218
Make way. Make way.
Single pregnant mother coming through.

01:29:11.963 --> 01:29:17.674
Laura, Josh. We need to give six
minutes to General Lu Tong, ok.

01:29:18.087 --> 01:29:21.865
It's a huge scoop.
- Yeah, Alice wants to pull the interview.

01:29:21.867 --> 01:29:25.087
She's got a feature on
"Is The World Really Ending On Tuesday?"

01:29:25.211 --> 01:29:28.795
Well it may as well if we lose Lu Tong.
Lu Tong stays.

01:29:28.919 --> 01:29:31.047
Six minutes. Let's do this.

01:29:32.463 --> 01:29:37.281
General Lu Tong, hi.
Sorry it's so chaotic in here today.

01:29:37.711 --> 01:29:41.087
Thank you for coming on.
We're on, live, in two minutes.

01:29:41.211 --> 01:29:45.835
Miranda will probably want to start with
what's going on in Naypyidaw.

01:29:45.963 --> 01:29:48.700
Go three.
- Miranda, back to General Lu Tong.

01:29:48.702 --> 01:29:52.738
Keep pressing.
- So let me ask you one more time, General Lu Tong...

01:29:52.740 --> 01:29:55.711
will you take responsibility for the
human rights abuses...

01:29:55.835 --> 01:29:57.671
perpetrated by your own government?

01:29:57.673 --> 01:30:01.205
He's on the rack. Tight on 4.
Get those beads of sweat.

01:30:01.207 --> 01:30:04.503
In you go, 4. Push it.
- I'm sorry, I can't answer that.

01:30:04.627 --> 01:30:07.080
Can't, or won't, Lu Tong?

01:30:07.180 --> 01:30:09.480
- Can't, or won't, General Lu Tong?

01:30:09.482 --> 01:30:12.327
On balance, I'd suggest "can't", considering

01:30:12.327 --> 01:30:15.127
I've just found General Lu Tong in the lobby,

01:30:15.129 --> 01:30:17.802
and his chauffeur is currently
live on air answering

01:30:17.802 --> 01:30:20.402
questions about Far Eastern geopolitics.

01:30:20.404 --> 01:30:24.095
No? Any comments you want to make
about the use of sexual torture...

01:30:24.097 --> 01:30:25.454
by your own military?

01:30:26.547 --> 01:30:30.990
Ask him about London traffic.
- London traffic, General Lu Tong,

01:30:30.992 --> 01:30:35.009
anything to say about that?
No comment there. Unbelievable.

01:30:35.295 --> 01:30:39.292
That's it from General Lu Tong.
We'll see you after this short break.

01:30:39.294 --> 01:30:40.685
Good job.

01:30:43.671 --> 01:30:46.211
Unfortunately, you leave me no choice.

01:30:46.335 --> 01:30:49.881
It is actually illegal to fire
somebody for being pregnant.

01:30:49.883 --> 01:30:52.924
I'm not firing her for being pregnant.
I'm firing her for gross incompetency.

01:30:52.926 --> 01:30:57.099
Bridget is the beating heart of this show.
How could you want to fire her?

01:30:57.101 --> 01:30:59.948
How about for interviewing a
chauffeur instead of a general?

01:30:59.950 --> 01:31:04.194
Using a TV interview to determine if a
guest might be the father of her child...

01:31:04.196 --> 01:31:08.679
and being responsible for the
broadcast of six bare arses?

01:31:14.171 --> 01:31:17.726
It's okay.
It really okay, Richard.

01:31:18.255 --> 01:31:21.909
I was going to quit anyway.
Probably.

01:31:22.419 --> 01:31:26.755
Believe it or not, I was a little
like you when I started here.

01:31:26.879 --> 01:31:32.159
A little chunkier and much less makeup,
but I wanted to make my mark too.

01:31:32.379 --> 01:31:34.835
But I don't want to be
part of your re-branding.

01:31:34.963 --> 01:31:39.120
I haven't got the right haircut anyway
and I don't drink cocktails out of jam jars

01:31:39.122 --> 01:31:41.444
or post photos of my lunch on Instagram.

01:31:41.446 --> 01:31:43.947
And I suppose it's become
unfashionable to care

01:31:43.947 --> 01:31:46.347
about wanting to make
something worthwhile.

01:31:46.367 --> 01:31:50.738
But I would rather be old-fashioned
and unemployed...

01:31:50.740 --> 01:31:53.694
than part of a show that
celebrates the inane.

01:31:53.963 --> 01:31:56.765
Then maybe when my boy
is old enough to understand,

01:31:56.765 --> 01:31:59.565
integrity will be fashionable again.

01:32:27.547 --> 01:32:29.127
What have I done?

01:32:43.919 --> 01:32:46.508
It's all very well fighting
for your principles

01:32:46.508 --> 01:32:49.108
when there's no food in the fridge.

01:32:53.879 --> 01:32:57.756
I mean, how difficult can
it be to find another job...

01:32:57.758 --> 01:33:01.157
when you've just been fired
and your nine months pregnant?

01:33:01.335 --> 01:33:06.329
And whatever happens now, I'm going
to get you one of those bloody Bugaboos.

01:33:09.503 --> 01:33:11.406
Birthday?

01:33:13.255 --> 01:33:15.919
Oh God, brains gone to mush.

01:33:16.503 --> 01:33:17.919
First shag?

01:33:23.474 --> 01:33:24.546
No.

01:33:26.879 --> 01:33:28.574
Bugger.

01:33:33.295 --> 01:33:34.919
I'm very sorry.

01:33:37.671 --> 01:33:41.243
I've gone all crap, all of a sudden.

01:33:41.843 --> 01:33:42.843
Right.

01:33:53.087 --> 01:33:55.379
No, no, no, no.
Fuck.

01:35:32.511 --> 01:35:35.595
Okay, new pre-birth resolutions.

01:35:35.719 --> 01:35:40.387
I, Bridget Jones,
am going to be the best mother in the world.

01:35:41.263 --> 01:35:43.555
I'm going to try not to
leave you in a shop...

01:35:43.679 --> 01:35:48.555
or put you in the washing machine like the
woman in the newspaper with her cat.

01:35:48.679 --> 01:35:53.829
Look, I know I made you a promise
to get things sorted before you got here.

01:35:54.011 --> 01:35:59.547
Well the truth is, I haven't,
but you and me can do this together...

01:36:00.219 --> 01:36:04.064
because knights in shining armour
don't exist any more.

01:36:04.763 --> 01:36:08.753
Or do they?

01:36:23.719 --> 01:36:25.366
Hi.

01:36:26.511 --> 01:36:30.900
Bridget. Good God, what are you doing there?
You're all wet.

01:36:30.902 --> 01:36:35.011
Yes, I locked myself out,
and left my bag...

01:36:35.013 --> 01:36:40.342
Lost my keys, phone, my mind.

01:36:41.303 --> 01:36:43.219
What are you doing here?

01:36:44.847 --> 01:36:50.932
It seems I can always find time to
save the world, but you're my world.

01:36:58.263 --> 01:37:00.803
I thought you were back with Candida.

01:37:01.555 --> 01:37:05.498
You know perfectly well her name's Camilla.
- Camilla.

01:37:07.847 --> 01:37:12.683
I came round your house to find you,
and she was there.

01:37:12.685 --> 01:37:16.020
She came to collect her bags.
Gone back to The Hague.

01:37:16.219 --> 01:37:18.347
Just taken her to the airport.

01:37:37.469 --> 01:37:38.717
Thank you.

01:37:42.261 --> 01:37:43.977
Bridget...

01:37:45.009 --> 01:37:47.469
You know I find emotional declarations...

01:37:48.677 --> 01:37:50.312
difficult.

01:37:52.093 --> 01:37:53.717
But the truth is ...

01:37:58.925 --> 01:38:01.345
Why are my trousers warm?

01:38:04.801 --> 01:38:07.133
My waters must have broken.
- Oh Jesus.

01:38:07.261 --> 01:38:09.425
So sorry. I'll get a cloth.

01:38:09.427 --> 01:38:11.836
But you're not due for another
two or three weeks.

01:38:11.838 --> 01:38:15.633
That's a contraction.
I think we should get to the hospital quickly.

01:38:15.761 --> 01:38:18.043
Absolutely.
- Let's take your car.

01:38:18.045 --> 01:38:20.845
I came in a taxi.
- Oh, for fucks sake.

01:38:20.847 --> 01:38:23.885
Well, how was I supposed to know?
- No, not you. The contractions.

01:38:23.887 --> 01:38:25.803
No, we'll take your car.

01:38:25.903 --> 01:38:28.303
- We can't. The car keys are in
my bag with everything else.

01:38:30.261 --> 01:38:34.385
Five, six, seven, eight...
- Just pant, and breathe, and count.

01:38:34.387 --> 01:38:36.969
... Nine, ten.
- It's what your supposed to do, isn't it?

01:38:43.969 --> 01:38:47.009
You should get that.
It might be work.

01:38:49.301 --> 01:38:53.586
No don't!
- Oi! What the fuck?

01:38:54.133 --> 01:38:58.218
That's really sweet,
but we've got to call a cab.

01:38:58.809 --> 01:38:59.809
Oh, shit.

01:39:00.009 --> 01:39:01.677
Right, what do we do?

01:39:04.261 --> 01:39:06.177
I'll think of something.

01:39:10.385 --> 01:39:12.425
Watch out.
- Out of the way.

01:39:13.885 --> 01:39:17.053
We go to the hospital.
We're going to make a baby.

01:39:20.177 --> 01:39:21.882
Let's go.

01:39:21.884 --> 01:39:26.890
God, this is...
This is really happening.

01:39:27.845 --> 01:39:31.425
I'm going to be a mother.
Maybe I'm too old for all this.

01:39:31.553 --> 01:39:33.925
Wait, wait. Why're you stopping?

01:39:34.425 --> 01:39:37.345
A margarita with onion and pineapple.
Number 17, thank you.

01:39:37.347 --> 01:39:38.956
What?

01:39:48.761 --> 01:39:52.916
Who is ordering onion with pineapple, huh?
Some people they're crazy, no?

01:39:54.969 --> 01:40:00.129
Yes. Okay. Here we go.

01:40:02.761 --> 01:40:05.177
Do not worry, Ms. Bridget.
We get you there.

01:40:05.301 --> 01:40:08.133
There is no traffic this time of night.
It's okay, eh?

01:40:08.261 --> 01:40:10.425
Vagina. Power to the vagina.

01:40:10.553 --> 01:40:15.956
My God. Unbelieveable.
Is a bloody women's rights march.

01:40:16.385 --> 01:40:20.638
Oh gees, not now.
- Christ, it's those women I defended.

01:40:21.301 --> 01:40:23.352
It's those infernal Russians.
Just hold my hand.

01:40:23.354 --> 01:40:26.208
We really need to get there.
We need to get there.

01:40:27.483 --> 01:40:31.228
Right, we're getting out. Ready?
- No, I don't think it's a good idea.

01:40:31.230 --> 01:40:32.761
No, Bridget... Bridget.

01:40:33.553 --> 01:40:37.917
Call Jack.
- I'll come behind with the bags, Mr. Mark.

01:40:38.217 --> 01:40:39.469
And I call Mr. Jack.

01:40:39.471 --> 01:40:43.071
It's all right, Bridget. We'll find a way.
- I don't think I can walk.

01:40:43.969 --> 01:40:46.009
It's alright.
I'll carry you.

01:41:10.133 --> 01:41:13.597
Good God, Bridget. You're immense.
- I can't help it.

01:41:14.801 --> 01:41:18.559
I think my lungs collapsed,
but this is not about me.

01:41:18.561 --> 01:41:20.345
The contractions are starting again.

01:41:20.347 --> 01:41:23.425
I'm going to have the baby in the street.
- I tell you what,

01:41:23.427 --> 01:41:27.976
we'll rest for ten, and we'll walk for ten.
- Okay.

01:41:44.177 --> 01:41:48.196
It's not much further.
- No.

01:41:48.198 --> 01:41:52.570
I think it's about a mile and a half.
- Don't think...

01:41:52.885 --> 01:41:55.301
Are you okay?

01:41:56.469 --> 01:41:59.836
It's probably best if I don't talk too much.
- Yes.

01:42:03.885 --> 01:42:08.889
Okay, I'm here. Okay.
I can take it from here.

01:42:08.925 --> 01:42:13.780
I'm here. Okay. I got this.
- Thank you.

01:42:16.677 --> 01:42:19.931
Jesus.

01:42:21.425 --> 01:42:24.593
This is a two man job.
- I'm here.

01:42:24.595 --> 01:42:26.677
Take her. Take her.
- I got her.

01:42:26.679 --> 01:42:28.717
Jesus. Don't drop her.

01:42:35.717 --> 01:42:37.677
Just inside.
- This way?

01:42:37.679 --> 01:42:39.633
Yes, there.
- No, this way.

01:42:40.593 --> 01:42:42.425
Okay, squeeze in.

01:42:42.553 --> 01:42:44.261
Are you squeezing?
- Get her.

01:42:44.263 --> 01:42:46.009
Squeeze in.
- I'm squeezing.

01:42:46.133 --> 01:42:47.628
Push.

01:42:49.509 --> 01:42:51.301
Closer.

01:42:51.425 --> 01:42:53.203
No, no, that's fine.

01:42:56.009 --> 01:42:58.553
We're out.
- Nurse.

01:42:58.677 --> 01:43:00.593
Carol, Carol, wheelchair.
Wheelchair

01:43:00.595 --> 01:43:05.825
One two three.
- Yes, over here. Please. Thank you.

01:43:08.261 --> 01:43:09.870
You okay?

01:43:11.345 --> 01:43:13.261
Which of you is the father?
- I am.

01:43:13.385 --> 01:43:15.200
Right.

01:43:20.177 --> 01:43:21.593
Breathe out the pain.

01:43:23.177 --> 01:43:24.548
Oh, good.
- Hey.

01:43:24.550 --> 01:43:27.713
I was wondering how many fathers we'd get.
A full house. Bingo.

01:43:28.469 --> 01:43:30.553
Bridget, how do you want do this?
An epidural?

01:43:30.555 --> 01:43:35.006
No, you can do this. A positive mental
attitude is stronger than any drug.

01:43:35.008 --> 01:43:38.746
Okay? Just think away the pain.
- Oh bollocks to that. No, I want everything.

01:43:38.885 --> 01:43:42.384
Gas, air, injections, morphine.

01:43:42.386 --> 01:43:45.950
Bridget, remember your yoga.
- Fuck yoga.

01:43:46.053 --> 01:43:47.677
Oh, I couldn't agree with you more.

01:43:47.679 --> 01:43:49.061
It's supposed to relax one...

01:43:49.063 --> 01:43:52.864
but I just spend the entire time clenching
my sphincter in an effort not to fart.

01:43:53.385 --> 01:43:56.570
Can we turn you over?
I just need to check your cervix.

01:43:59.177 --> 01:44:02.717
You're doing very well.
Turning around. Turn to me.

01:44:03.301 --> 01:44:04.717
Just a little rummage.

01:44:05.469 --> 01:44:08.261
Okay, ready? Rummaging... now.

01:44:11.469 --> 01:44:14.466
Yes. Oh, good, good..
You at eight centimeters already.

01:44:14.468 --> 01:44:16.862
That's excellent.
That means you can't have any drugs at all.

01:44:16.864 --> 01:44:19.108
What?
- You're too far gone.

01:44:19.425 --> 01:44:21.959
Well done. Ooh, another contraction.

01:44:23.133 --> 01:44:27.717
I'm not sure how much there is to gain from
you two being at the coal face if I'm honest.

01:44:27.845 --> 01:44:31.149
My ex-husband said it was like watching
his favourite pub burn down.

01:44:31.177 --> 01:44:32.841
So. Your choice.

01:44:34.761 --> 01:44:38.517
Maybe dad should go and
fetch mum a cool flannel.

01:44:42.053 --> 01:44:43.301
I know. I know.

01:44:44.677 --> 01:44:50.944
It's okay. You can do this.
Just, think away the pain.

01:44:51.593 --> 01:44:53.717
Mother fucker.

01:44:53.845 --> 01:44:57.807
Just think away the pain.
- Get out, both of you.

01:44:59.301 --> 01:45:00.801
Where are you going?

01:45:03.801 --> 01:45:07.009
I've changed my mind.

01:45:07.133 --> 01:45:10.133
I've changed my mind.

01:46:05.553 --> 01:46:07.367
You can do this.

01:46:09.385 --> 01:46:11.093
You can. We can do it together.

01:46:11.217 --> 01:46:14.009
Just think what lifes thrown at you already.

01:46:17.761 --> 01:46:20.133
You've turned disasters into triumphs...

01:46:20.135 --> 01:46:25.060
with your sheer, joyful, indefatigable,
infectious lust for life.

01:46:25.062 --> 01:46:28.040
You've managed this entire pregnancy
almost entirely on your own...

01:46:28.042 --> 01:46:33.738
despite a lunatic mother, repressed men and
cheating boyfriends who don't deserve you.

01:46:36.885 --> 01:46:38.928
Just a last few moments.

01:46:39.133 --> 01:46:42.831
Just a last few moments, my love,
and then you'll see your beautiful baby.

01:46:43.677 --> 01:46:48.679
What if it's not yours?
- I'll love him anyway, just as I love you.

01:46:49.217 --> 01:46:53.548
The way you were, the way you are,
the way you always will be.

01:47:01.345 --> 01:47:04.406
I think you better go and have that seen to.
- Thank you.

01:47:04.845 --> 01:47:06.717
I'll handle it from here.

01:47:10.677 --> 01:47:12.761
Think the pain away.

01:47:12.763 --> 01:47:15.794
You're pushing an entire human
being out of your vagina.

01:47:15.894 --> 01:47:18.694
I'd like to see them thinking it away.

01:47:19.633 --> 01:47:23.925
And, with 367 of the votes...

01:47:24.053 --> 01:47:28.729
the winner is Pamela Margaret Jones.
- Pamela, honey, it's Bridget.

01:47:28.731 --> 01:47:31.117
Not now, Colin.
- It's about the baby.

01:47:31.119 --> 01:47:34.985
I hereby declare that
Pamela Margaret Jones...

01:47:34.987 --> 01:47:38.029
I'm so sorry.
You'll have to excuse me.

01:47:38.093 --> 01:47:40.301
We are about to become a grandmother.

01:47:42.509 --> 01:47:47.118
Well, that's it for the special late
night edition of "Hard News".

01:47:48.133 --> 01:47:51.038
25 seconds to off air. 25.
- Standby.

01:47:51.040 --> 01:47:52.183
Bridget's in labor.

01:47:52.583 --> 01:47:54.383
Bridget's in labor!!

01:47:54.385 --> 01:47:57.824
Except to say Bridget Jones is in labour!

01:48:03.509 --> 01:48:05.217
Yes.
- Run the credits.

01:48:05.219 --> 01:48:07.217
Credits.
- Run the credits.

01:48:07.345 --> 01:48:10.671
I hope I'm bloody godmother.
- Cue the fucking weather.

01:48:11.717 --> 01:48:13.217
Listen I...

01:48:16.845 --> 01:48:19.054
I owe you an apology.

01:48:20.261 --> 01:48:23.268
I know I haven't behaved
very well in all of this.

01:48:25.301 --> 01:48:26.914
No, it's okay.

01:48:51.846 --> 01:48:53.138
Hello.

01:49:16.638 --> 01:49:19.470
Say hello to our beautiful boy.

01:49:21.970 --> 01:49:24.178
Go ahead.
- Thank you.

01:49:39.386 --> 01:49:41.138
Let's see who you are.

01:49:41.140 --> 01:49:43.262
Isn't he perfect?
- Yes.

01:50:04.930 --> 01:50:06.178
Hello.

01:50:10.306 --> 01:50:12.094
I'm so sorry I'm late, Bridge.

01:50:12.096 --> 01:50:14.306
Some lesbians are having
a stupid all night march.

01:50:14.308 --> 01:50:16.511
Actually, they're marching in aid of free speech.

01:50:16.513 --> 01:50:19.031
It's rather important.
- My God, look at him.

01:50:19.033 --> 01:50:20.262
Bridge.

01:50:21.222 --> 01:50:24.722
I'm so sorry that we weren't here.
There's an unbelievably long march.

01:50:24.724 --> 01:50:26.970
Actually, the march is critical...
- Can I be godfather?

01:50:27.094 --> 01:50:29.514
Oh, I'm depending on you.

01:50:30.014 --> 01:50:31.930
Oh, congratulations.
- Well done.

01:50:31.932 --> 01:50:33.568
Thank you very much.
- Well done.

01:50:33.570 --> 01:50:35.222
Well done, both of you.
- To all of you.

01:50:35.346 --> 01:50:36.886
Where is she?

01:50:36.888 --> 01:50:39.970
I'm so sorry we didn't get here on time.
Daddy's parking the car.

01:50:39.972 --> 01:50:44.027
There's some march for women's rights.
I mean, honestly, do we need any more rights?

01:50:45.222 --> 01:50:46.886
Mom, meet your new grandson.

01:50:49.514 --> 01:50:52.346
The darling. He looks just like...

01:50:55.970 --> 01:51:00.484
Not that it matters, but...
do we know who the daddy is yet?

01:51:03.138 --> 01:51:04.514
Shall we find out?

01:51:06.722 --> 01:51:08.722
Come on, you two.
Time for a little test.

01:51:09.722 --> 01:51:12.806
It's so exciting, isn't it?
It's like the final of the X Factor or something.

01:51:12.808 --> 01:51:17.183
Dial 01 if you want it to be Mark and
02 if you want it to be Jack.

01:51:31.846 --> 01:51:34.138
Well, good luck.
- You too.

01:51:40.806 --> 01:51:42.386
Please.
- Thank you.

01:53:03.222 --> 01:53:05.999
You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

01:53:06.594 --> 01:53:09.336
Hello darling. Hello.

01:53:09.886 --> 01:53:11.552
Hello.

01:53:21.346 --> 01:53:24.340
Hello.
- Hi.

01:53:27.806 --> 01:53:31.898
We're really doing this.
- No going back now.

01:53:32.470 --> 01:53:37.474
We are gathered here to celebrate the
union of Bridget Rose Jones...

01:53:37.970 --> 01:53:41.054
and Mark Fitzwilliam Darcy.

01:53:42.806 --> 01:53:47.237
Aand by the powers vested in me,
I now pronounce you...

01:53:47.762 --> 01:53:51.491
finally, husband and wife.

01:54:34.470 --> 01:54:37.274
Jack, what on earth are
you doing with my son?

01:54:37.374 --> 01:54:40.174
Well, don't leave me
alone with him again.

01:54:40.176 --> 01:54:43.509
I have no idea what I'm doing.
- Is he traumatized?

01:54:50.886 --> 01:54:55.945
Hallo, William Jones-Darcy.
Are you ready?

01:54:58.346 --> 01:55:01.222
Some champagne for you?
- Yes please.

01:55:02.554 --> 01:55:07.253
Dear Diary. And so, I, Bridget Jones ...

01:55:07.386 --> 01:55:11.899
am a singleton no more. Married? Yes.

01:55:12.178 --> 01:55:15.962
Smug? Well, it's about time, so...

01:55:16.306 --> 01:55:18.222
maybe just a little.
