00:01.140 --> 00:02.985
<i>Previously on "Whiskey Cavalier"...</i>

00:03.045 --> 00:04.511
The three of us should
grab a beer sometime.

00:04.513 --> 00:06.354
Ray, I feel like we've been
down this road before.

00:06.379 --> 00:07.612
I'm gonna let Jai take this one.

00:07.637 --> 00:08.869
You stole his girlfriend,
broke his heart,

00:08.871 --> 00:10.070
and he pretty much wants you dead.

00:10.072 --> 00:11.305
Okay.

00:11.307 --> 00:13.906
I'm just hoping
to hang around long enough

00:13.931 --> 00:16.398
that someday, Will will
forgive me and let me back in.

00:16.400 --> 00:17.699
I have five sisters.

00:17.701 --> 00:19.334
In my house, it could get pretty vicious.

00:19.336 --> 00:22.404
And my only defense mechanism
was reading people.

00:22.406 --> 00:25.540
But it didn't make my sisters
want to hang out with me much.

00:25.542 --> 00:26.975
Frankie Trowbridge...

00:26.977 --> 00:29.578
her parents were killed
in a terrorist attack.

00:29.580 --> 00:32.447
So cataclysmic loss,
probably blames herself,

00:32.448 --> 00:33.882
definite fear of intimacy.

00:33.884 --> 00:35.250
Let me make something clear.

00:35.252 --> 00:37.352
I don't mix the personal
with the professional.

00:37.354 --> 00:40.722
So I'm never going to let myself
care about any of you.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.074

00:49.066 --> 00:50.999
I don't care that the weather is crappy.

00:51.001 --> 00:52.701
You know what I love about Los Angeles?

00:52.703 --> 00:54.102
Is it how people walk on the beach

00:54.104 --> 00:55.771
without annoying each other
with small talk?

00:55.773 --> 00:57.939
Ignoring your hint,
moving on with my thought.

00:57.941 --> 00:59.841
- Mm.
- L.A. has <i>everything.</i>

00:59.843 --> 01:01.977
I mean, you want the ocean?
Boom. There it is.

01:01.979 --> 01:04.012
Mountains? Whoa! Right there!

01:04.013 --> 01:05.814
You want a little joy in your life?

01:05.816 --> 01:06.982
They've got Disneyland.

01:06.984 --> 01:08.220
Yeah, I'm not big on joy.

01:08.222 --> 01:09.885
I'm well aware of that.

01:09.887 --> 01:11.987
We're here to stop
a former Homeland Security agent

01:11.989 --> 01:13.155
from selling state secrets,

01:13.157 --> 01:14.556
not go on amusement park rides.

01:14.558 --> 01:16.725
Oh, so that's a... that's a "No"
to the Ferris wheel?

01:16.727 --> 01:17.923
Correct.

01:17.925 --> 01:19.561
Alright, but when we're done,
I'm gonna ask again

01:19.563 --> 01:21.196
'cause it's right there!

01:21.964 --> 01:23.832
Come on! It's so close!

01:26.770 --> 01:29.337
Alright. There they are.

01:30.473 --> 01:32.140
That's a camisole.

01:32.142 --> 01:33.809
Alright, I'll stick with
the buyer. You get the seller.

01:33.811 --> 01:35.477
No. <i>I'll</i> get the buyer.

01:35.479 --> 01:37.179
You're just saying that 'cause
it's the opposite of what I said.

01:37.181 --> 01:38.580
No comment.

01:40.918 --> 01:43.518
Aw, we got to run? We got to do this?

01:53.297 --> 01:54.429
Aah!

02:07.711 --> 02:08.710
Will!

02:08.711 --> 02:09.911
Will, are you okay?!

02:22.292 --> 02:23.358
Wait here.

02:27.297 --> 02:28.563
You're okay?!

02:28.565 --> 02:30.665
Why would that upset you?

02:34.438 --> 02:35.889
Great!

02:36.540 --> 02:37.998
Uh, where's your guy?

02:38.000 --> 02:39.268
You happy?

02:39.843 --> 02:41.409
I don't...

02:41.411 --> 02:43.845
Wait, did he get away
because you came to check on <i>me?</i>

02:43.847 --> 02:45.113
I don't want to talk about it.

02:45.115 --> 02:47.015
- You were worried about me!
- No, I wasn't.

02:47.017 --> 02:48.817
You <i>were. This is a big moment for us.</i>

02:48.819 --> 02:50.218
Thank you for caring so much.

02:50.220 --> 02:52.053
Not another word, okay?

02:52.055 --> 02:54.089
Hey, we should go
on the Ferris wheel now.

03:24.926 --> 03:27.355
Look, you have to stop
beating yourself up about L.A.

03:27.357 --> 03:28.523
Yes, the buyer got away,

03:28.525 --> 03:29.858
but he didn't get what he wanted, so...

03:29.860 --> 03:31.326
I know. What's wrong with me?

03:31.328 --> 03:33.395
Why do I even care if you get shot?

03:33.397 --> 03:35.397
I have, like, a thousand answers to that.

03:35.399 --> 03:38.500
Look, Frankie, all you did
was show some compassion.

03:38.502 --> 03:40.101
Now, I'm sure
it probably feels weird to you,

03:40.103 --> 03:41.703
but trust me, it's a good thing.

03:41.705 --> 03:43.538
You're so annoying.

03:43.540 --> 03:44.624
Right?

03:45.174 --> 03:46.775
That feels like a trick question.

03:46.777 --> 03:48.580
She's just mad at me 'cause
she showed some compassion.

03:48.582 --> 03:50.111
Frankie? Compassion?

03:50.113 --> 03:51.813
Unh! Yeah.

03:52.882 --> 03:54.382
She got sharp knuckles.

03:54.384 --> 03:56.318
Alright, I got to go
get our new mission from Ray.

03:56.320 --> 03:57.750
You want to step into Frankie's spot?

03:57.752 --> 03:59.065
Yes! Finally!

03:59.067 --> 04:00.856
Does this make me co-leader?
Do I get a raise?

04:00.858 --> 04:02.624
Can I wear my new sunglasses?

04:02.979 --> 04:04.180
No.

04:06.395 --> 04:08.411
Pretty dark in here. Can you even see?

04:08.412 --> 04:09.816
I can see fine.

04:11.948 --> 04:13.048
Perfect.

04:13.050 --> 04:14.583
Oh, Ray, before we get started,

04:14.585 --> 04:17.119
Frankie's kind of upset about
losing her guy in Los Angeles.

04:17.120 --> 04:18.853
Can you see if you can
track down the buyer for me?

04:18.856 --> 04:20.822
So, you want me to do you a favor,

04:20.824 --> 04:22.496
like a friend would?

04:24.164 --> 04:26.604
I'm just grateful that you're
letting me back in your life.

04:26.606 --> 04:28.497
Ray, I'm not I...

04:29.465 --> 04:31.533
My partner would like
to get right to the mission.

04:31.535 --> 04:34.336
You know, you're not allowed
to come to these anymore.

04:34.338 --> 04:35.670
Why?

04:35.672 --> 04:36.972
Why do <i>you</i> think?

04:36.974 --> 04:39.107
Don't look at me...
You can't even <i>see</i> me.

04:39.109 --> 04:40.108
Go ahead, Ray.

04:40.110 --> 04:41.443
Meet Eddie Benson.

04:41.445 --> 04:44.312
Owner of several <i>Fortune</i> 500 companies.

04:44.314 --> 04:46.815
We believe his most profitable venture

04:46.817 --> 04:48.450
is running a massive drug cartel.

04:48.452 --> 04:51.820
It manufactures and distributes
illegal opioids.

04:51.822 --> 04:54.923
His pills are responsible
for a spike in teenage overdoses

04:54.925 --> 04:57.426
all up and down the Eastern Seaboard.

04:57.428 --> 04:59.628
What, and the DEA can't
pin anything on Benson?

04:59.630 --> 05:01.863
Nope. But we have intel that

05:01.865 --> 05:04.132
several prominent businessmen
acted as silent partners.

05:04.134 --> 05:05.934
They gave money to the operation

05:05.936 --> 05:07.292
without getting their hands dirty.

05:07.294 --> 05:08.300
Hmm.

05:08.302 --> 05:10.071
Including Daniel Lou.

05:10.073 --> 05:12.407
He's the CEO
of one of Benson's companies.

05:12.409 --> 05:15.210
A philanthropist, he's married to
a federal judge in Connecticut.

05:15.212 --> 05:17.546
Daniel is our way in.

05:17.548 --> 05:18.613
Why him?

05:18.615 --> 05:20.482
His wife, Kelly Ashland.

05:20.484 --> 05:23.685
She's the closest thing
that Frankie has to family.

05:23.687 --> 05:25.120
No way.

05:25.122 --> 05:27.289
Frankie always refers
to "family" as the "F" word.

05:27.291 --> 05:28.356
That's true.

05:28.358 --> 05:30.192
So, we use Kelly to get close to Daniel.

05:30.194 --> 05:31.593
If he flips on Benson,

05:31.595 --> 05:33.895
we can take him
and his entire cartel down.

05:33.897 --> 05:35.130
Alright, well, looks like

05:35.132 --> 05:36.631
Frankie and I are heading to Connecticut.

05:36.633 --> 05:37.666
- Aah!
- Come on.

05:37.668 --> 05:38.900
I'm sorry.

05:38.902 --> 05:40.802
You got to take those things off, man.

05:40.804 --> 05:42.204
Never.

06:19.475 --> 06:20.575
Hey, Will?

06:20.577 --> 06:22.277
38 minutes.

06:22.279 --> 06:23.612
38 minutes.

06:23.614 --> 06:25.514
See that? That's how long
you went without speaking.

06:25.516 --> 06:27.516
I told myself I was
just gonna wait you out.

06:27.518 --> 06:28.884
My head almost exploded.

06:28.886 --> 06:29.951
Ah.

06:29.953 --> 06:32.087
If I open up a <i>little</i> bit,

06:32.089 --> 06:33.588
do you promise not to overreact?

06:33.590 --> 06:34.689
Mmmmmmm...

06:34.691 --> 06:35.790
nope.

06:36.994 --> 06:38.793
Kelly was like a second mother to me.

06:38.795 --> 06:40.595
She was good friends
with my parents and...

06:40.597 --> 06:42.969
when they died, she became my guardian.

06:43.600 --> 06:46.034
I was 17. I wasn't
the easiest kid to deal with.

06:46.723 --> 06:49.604
Anyway, I haven't spoken to her
since I joined the CIA.

06:49.606 --> 06:51.106
Family's a liability.

06:51.728 --> 06:53.475
That feels healthy.

06:53.477 --> 06:55.176
Yeah. She gets it.

06:55.178 --> 06:56.444
She taught me to be strong...

06:56.446 --> 06:59.347
not to let my emotions
knock me off my path.

06:59.349 --> 07:01.616
She's the toughest person I know.

07:02.719 --> 07:04.352
I love how closed-off she is.

07:05.033 --> 07:07.155
That's not a thing people say.

07:09.725 --> 07:11.426
Ooh!

07:11.428 --> 07:13.028
What?

07:13.030 --> 07:14.629
You guys haven't seen each other
in a long time.

07:14.631 --> 07:16.498
This is exciting.
Come on. Aren't you excited?

07:16.500 --> 07:18.900
Maybe you should wait in the car.

07:20.369 --> 07:23.405
Open, open, open, open.

07:26.475 --> 07:28.143
Surprise! Huh?

07:29.011 --> 07:30.512
Kelly. It's good to see you.

07:30.514 --> 07:33.448
Frankie. It's been a long time.

07:36.619 --> 07:38.887
Okay, so, not exactly a hug,
but still a moment.

07:38.889 --> 07:41.156
Right. You guys want me to get
a picture of this? Here you go.

07:41.158 --> 07:43.058
Got it.

07:43.060 --> 07:44.693
Is he always like this?

07:44.695 --> 07:45.994
Pretty much.

07:45.996 --> 07:47.562
He's cute, but it makes him less cute.

07:47.564 --> 07:48.857
Tell me about it.

07:48.859 --> 07:50.966
I mean, he tried to talk to me
in the car the whole way here!

07:50.968 --> 07:52.067
So annoying.

07:52.069 --> 07:54.336
Oh, God. There's two of them.

07:56.906 --> 07:58.907
I need to delete that.

07:58.909 --> 08:00.275
So...

08:00.277 --> 08:01.876
are you two a couple?

08:02.980 --> 08:04.412
<i>You</i> tell <i>me.</i>

08:04.414 --> 08:06.381
Hmm.

08:06.383 --> 08:07.682
Well...

08:07.684 --> 08:08.883
Oh.

08:08.885 --> 08:10.685
You always liked green eyes.

08:10.687 --> 08:12.187
Oh. Watch out.

08:12.189 --> 08:14.422
But he's a bit of a human Care Bear.

08:14.424 --> 08:15.757
In a <i>good</i> way.

08:15.759 --> 08:17.092
Eh, eh...

08:17.094 --> 08:18.360
I'll take it.

08:18.362 --> 08:19.928
Kelly, you got a beautiful family here.

08:19.930 --> 08:21.363
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

08:21.365 --> 08:24.366
That's my husband, Daniel,
and our son, Tommy.

08:24.368 --> 08:26.096
I can't wait for you to meet them.

08:26.098 --> 08:27.135
Yeah.

08:27.137 --> 08:28.970
So much has changed.

08:28.972 --> 08:30.753
Oh, Frankie.

08:30.755 --> 08:32.674
You made the wall.
And you're in a prom dress.

08:32.676 --> 08:33.808
That's not me.

08:33.809 --> 08:35.143
And it's pink. Oh, it's so pink!

08:35.145 --> 08:36.277
I will kill you dead.

08:36.279 --> 08:37.479
I'm gonna take a picture of this

08:37.481 --> 08:39.481
and send it to everybody I know.

08:39.482 --> 08:41.616
I'm gonna need some wine.

08:41.618 --> 08:42.884
- I'm in.
- Great.

08:42.885 --> 08:44.519
I'll join you guys in just a second.

08:44.521 --> 08:45.787
Don't rush.

08:46.823 --> 08:47.922
What would you like?

08:47.924 --> 08:49.524
Um... what do you have?

08:57.300 --> 08:58.778
Look at that smile.

08:58.780 --> 08:59.836
Oh, my goodness.

08:59.838 --> 09:01.703
I can't believe you went
as Britney Spears for Halloween.

09:01.705 --> 09:02.804
Oh, that wasn't Halloween.

09:02.806 --> 09:04.472
That was just a normal day of school.

09:04.474 --> 09:05.540
No.

09:05.542 --> 09:07.242
It was just a short... year-long phase.

09:07.244 --> 09:09.711
- Mm-hmm.
- I can't believe you made a scrapbook.

09:09.713 --> 09:11.413
And a son!

09:11.415 --> 09:12.714
What happened to you?

09:13.643 --> 09:16.217
Oh.

09:16.219 --> 09:18.787
I, um...

09:18.789 --> 09:21.389
Really missed you after you left.

09:21.391 --> 09:25.527
And I realized
that I really liked having...

09:25.529 --> 09:27.962
someone in my life,
someone that I could care for.

09:27.964 --> 09:31.599
And it was hard,
but as soon as I opened up,

09:31.601 --> 09:34.135
I met Daniel, and we had Tommy.

09:34.137 --> 09:37.806
And, well, I... I'm happy.

09:39.575 --> 09:41.409
That's nice.

09:41.411 --> 09:43.608
I'm gonna get some more wine.

09:44.081 --> 09:45.613
Well, I think it's great.

09:45.615 --> 09:47.415
And not just because
you kept this picture

09:47.417 --> 09:49.851
of Frankie in cornrows,
which I'm gonna take.

09:49.853 --> 09:51.486
Yeah? Alright. It's gonna come in handy.

09:51.488 --> 09:53.388
Oh, you think <i>that's</i> silly?

09:53.390 --> 09:54.522
Look at that one.

09:54.524 --> 09:56.424
Ooh! Yikes. That's priceless.

09:56.426 --> 09:58.526
There are just so many good ones.

09:58.528 --> 10:00.095
And how about you, Frankie?

10:00.097 --> 10:02.130
I think about you a lot. Are you happy?

10:02.132 --> 10:03.264
Yeah, sometimes.

10:03.266 --> 10:04.632
You know, when you were a kid,

10:04.634 --> 10:08.236
I was so busy with cases, and I just...

10:08.238 --> 10:11.306
I really worry that I was too strict.

10:13.175 --> 10:14.509
You were fine.

10:16.912 --> 10:19.414
So, what does the, um... CIA

10:19.416 --> 10:21.316
have you into town for this time?

10:22.218 --> 10:23.848
We're looking for a counterfeiter.

10:23.850 --> 10:26.654
Yeah. Uh, Treasury sent us
down here to check things out.

10:26.656 --> 10:29.557
Which reminds me...
we have a lot of work to do.

10:29.559 --> 10:31.226
Oh. Alright.

10:31.228 --> 10:32.449
Thank you.

10:33.096 --> 10:35.130
Before you go, come here.

10:35.132 --> 10:36.464
Why?

10:38.501 --> 10:39.734
Okay.

10:42.571 --> 10:45.073
And how about you, big guy? You want one?

10:45.075 --> 10:46.674
You know it. Coming in hot.

10:46.676 --> 10:48.543
Come on. We <i>just</i> met.

10:48.545 --> 10:49.844
Yeah, I know. But still, right?

10:49.846 --> 10:52.147
I-I know, but... no.

10:52.149 --> 10:54.115
That's alright. We got time.

10:54.117 --> 10:55.550
Kelly seems to have changed a lot.

10:55.552 --> 10:56.885
I mean, she's the woman who molded you

10:56.887 --> 10:58.553
into the fiercely independent
woman you are,

10:58.555 --> 11:00.602
and yet, now she's so open
and compassionate.

11:00.604 --> 11:01.589
Don't you think?

11:02.792 --> 11:04.692
What, are we not talking again?

11:06.295 --> 11:09.164
Alright. I'll start the clock back up.

11:15.878 --> 11:17.511
I'm inputting the photos that Will sent

11:17.513 --> 11:18.879
and running facial recognition,

11:18.881 --> 11:20.001
seeing if any of Daniel's friends

11:20.003 --> 11:21.662
have criminal records
that connect to Benson's.

11:21.663 --> 11:23.130
Alright, we have surveillance
from all the cameras

11:23.132 --> 11:25.465
that Frankie put inside Kelly's house.

11:25.467 --> 11:27.167
Hey, party people!

11:27.169 --> 11:29.436
Who wants doughnuts?

11:29.438 --> 11:30.904
I do.

11:30.906 --> 11:32.773
But whenever you bring me food,
you want something.

11:32.775 --> 11:34.107
That is not true.

11:34.109 --> 11:35.942
But can I ask you a favor?

11:38.212 --> 11:39.179
What do you want?

11:39.181 --> 11:40.580
Well, see, I'm trying to track down

11:40.582 --> 11:41.815
that Los Angeles buyer for Will,

11:41.817 --> 11:43.283
but I'm having a little trouble.

11:43.285 --> 11:44.885
So I was wondering
if maybe you could help me out

11:44.887 --> 11:46.853
with Operation
"Win Will's Friendship Back"?

11:46.855 --> 11:49.322
Why don't you send <i>him</i>
<i>a box of doughnuts?</i>

11:49.324 --> 11:50.824
Mm.

11:50.826 --> 11:53.026
Must be nice being Will's guy.

11:53.028 --> 11:54.761
I used to be his guy.

11:54.763 --> 11:56.630
He used to yell at <i>me</i>
<i>for doing stupid things,</i>

11:56.632 --> 11:58.265
like wearing sunglasses inside.

11:58.267 --> 11:59.833
You can't guilt me, Ray.

11:59.835 --> 12:00.913
Okay, how about this?

12:00.915 --> 12:04.070
If you say yes, I promise
I will leave right now.

12:04.072 --> 12:05.906
Oh, God. Please say yes.

12:06.707 --> 12:07.908
Fine.

12:07.910 --> 12:09.176
I'll get to it when I have some time.

12:09.178 --> 12:10.744
Thanks, buddy.

12:10.746 --> 12:11.631
Mm-hmm.

12:12.190 --> 12:14.014
Okay, I went back

12:14.016 --> 12:16.316
and read the psych evaluation
I did on Frankie.

12:16.318 --> 12:18.785
All the pertinent info
on Kelly... Will's right.

12:18.787 --> 12:20.387
She's totally clean.

12:20.389 --> 12:22.923
Wait, you did
a psych evaluation on Frankie?

12:23.604 --> 12:24.920
I did.

12:24.945 --> 12:28.195
So, do you write psych
evaluations on <i>us,</i> as well?

12:28.915 --> 12:29.942
What?

12:30.098 --> 12:31.498
Can we see them?

12:33.267 --> 12:34.267
What?

12:35.204 --> 12:36.478
I feel like you can hear us.

12:37.527 --> 12:39.439
Look, it is my job

12:39.441 --> 12:42.108
to write psych profiles
on every member of the team.

12:42.110 --> 12:44.211
But it's not healthy
for you to read them.

12:45.526 --> 12:46.626
Okay.

12:46.651 --> 12:48.084
No problem.

12:49.036 --> 12:50.587
Thank you.

12:54.188 --> 12:56.423
I need you to come to
the bathroom with me.

12:56.425 --> 12:57.457
Right now.

13:00.329 --> 13:01.764
This better be work-related.

13:02.690 --> 13:04.824
Come stand in front of this sink.

13:04.849 --> 13:06.448
- You good?
- Yeah.

13:06.473 --> 13:07.472
Alright.

13:12.674 --> 13:13.807
Huh?

13:13.809 --> 13:15.475
Yo! How did you build that?

13:15.477 --> 13:17.644
I didn't. I just found this button.

13:17.646 --> 13:20.113
I guess it's leftover from
when the CIA ran this place.

13:20.115 --> 13:22.082
During the Cold War,
they probably used it to, like,

13:22.084 --> 13:24.851
spy on assets and torture people.

13:24.853 --> 13:26.720
Just fun CIA stuff.

13:26.722 --> 13:28.321
But I did build <i>this.</i>

13:29.323 --> 13:31.024
Okay, this place is awesome.

13:31.026 --> 13:32.592
Dude, you have your own secret lair!

13:32.594 --> 13:33.693
This is my Batcave.

13:33.695 --> 13:34.761
I...

13:34.763 --> 13:36.396
Yoh, no! Don't touch that.

13:36.398 --> 13:38.865
Those are exploding glasses.

13:38.867 --> 13:40.867
And exploding keys...

13:40.869 --> 13:42.102
exploding nail clippers.

13:42.104 --> 13:44.070
Everything explodes.

13:44.072 --> 13:46.139
Except for those two.

13:47.375 --> 13:49.376
Jai, is that a computer station for me?

13:49.378 --> 13:51.144
'Cause if so, I may get emotional.

13:51.146 --> 13:53.046
In case someone wants
to break into some files

13:53.048 --> 13:54.547
without Susan finding out.

13:58.453 --> 14:01.154
Okay. How long do you need
to pull up our psych evals?

14:01.156 --> 14:02.722
You already got it.
It's right there. Enjoy.

14:02.724 --> 14:03.924
Ooh!

14:03.926 --> 14:05.759
That's so true about me.

14:05.761 --> 14:07.861
Loyalty <i>is my best quality.</i>

14:08.796 --> 14:10.230
That's tough, but fair.

14:10.232 --> 14:12.465
I told her that in confidence.

14:14.702 --> 14:15.802
Okay, now I'm hurt.

14:15.804 --> 14:16.937
How bad is yours?

14:21.109 --> 14:23.043
Hey. What are you watching?

14:23.045 --> 14:24.978
A horror film.

14:24.980 --> 14:26.346
<i>- Mwah!
- Love you.</i>

14:26.348 --> 14:27.280
<i>Let's go.</i>

14:27.282 --> 14:28.581
Yeah, that's... terrifying.

14:28.583 --> 14:30.784
This is what happens when you go soft.

14:30.786 --> 14:32.152
You end up married to a man

14:32.154 --> 14:33.520
who launders money for a drug lord

14:33.522 --> 14:35.422
so that you and your son
can have a nice house.

14:35.424 --> 14:37.557
Yeah, well, that's...
that's always what happens.

14:37.559 --> 14:40.093
Now I have to tear them apart
and ruin Kelly's life.

14:40.095 --> 14:42.062
I'm gonna talk to Daniel.

14:42.064 --> 14:43.363
Maybe I'll shoot him.

14:43.365 --> 14:44.864
No, you can't just assume
Daniel's gonna start

14:44.866 --> 14:46.399
talking about Benson
and incriminate himself.

14:46.401 --> 14:47.968
Alright, we need some sort of leverage.

14:47.970 --> 14:49.636
Ask and you shall receive.

14:49.638 --> 14:50.613
Oh.

14:50.615 --> 14:52.906
Got a hit on that picture you sent back.

14:52.908 --> 14:55.475
Rodney Seagel.
He works for Daniel's company.

14:55.477 --> 14:58.511
He's a chemist
with a nice but modest salary.

14:58.513 --> 15:00.213
And yet, he has millions of dollars

15:00.215 --> 15:02.349
in offshore accounts
in the Cayman Islands.

15:02.351 --> 15:03.817
Alright, so, Seagel takes us to Daniel,

15:03.819 --> 15:05.685
Daniel rolls on Benson,
we can take down the cartel.

15:05.687 --> 15:06.886
- Sounds good.
- Yeah.

15:06.888 --> 15:08.121
Point me in Seagel's direction.

15:08.123 --> 15:09.522
Standish hacked into his calendar.

15:09.524 --> 15:11.491
He's playing tennis
at a sports club in Westport

15:11.493 --> 15:13.126
first thing tomorrow morning.

15:13.128 --> 15:15.295
Oh, that's great.
I look great in tennis shorts.

15:21.235 --> 15:22.936
You look terrible in those shorts.

15:22.938 --> 15:24.371
Please. I look amazing.

15:24.373 --> 15:25.972
Alright. Stay in character.

15:25.974 --> 15:27.707
Come on... your turn.

15:31.580 --> 15:33.446
- Okay.
- Ohh!

15:33.448 --> 15:34.948
Maybe golf is more your sport.

15:34.950 --> 15:36.116
Sorry... I didn't have time growing up

15:36.118 --> 15:38.118
to play rich white guy sports.

15:38.120 --> 15:40.353
I was too busy being cool and having fun.

15:40.355 --> 15:42.122
Alright, let's... let's stop.

15:42.124 --> 15:43.623
Let's work on your forehand here
for a second.

15:43.625 --> 15:46.192
Okay? Just... I want you
to stand right about here.

15:46.194 --> 15:48.061
Okay, show me how you hold the racket.

15:48.063 --> 15:49.362
Alright, that's where we'll start.

15:49.364 --> 15:50.930
Just turn it just a little bit like that.

15:50.932 --> 15:52.065
Okay, great.

15:52.067 --> 15:53.967
Now, forehand, you start low.

15:53.969 --> 15:55.301
- Okay.
- Right?

15:55.303 --> 15:57.170
Take it all the way over your shoulder.

15:57.172 --> 15:58.405
- Show me that.
- Okay.

15:58.407 --> 15:59.406
Yep.

15:59.408 --> 16:01.641
Low... to high.

16:03.511 --> 16:04.644
Yeah, just like that.

16:04.646 --> 16:06.346
<i>Okay, easy with the rackets.</i>

16:06.348 --> 16:07.680
Remember, there's a tranquilizer
switch in the handle,

16:07.682 --> 16:09.282
<i>so don't stick him for too long.</i>

16:09.284 --> 16:11.851
Otherwise, his heart might,
you know... stop.

16:11.853 --> 16:13.820
Yeah. That's cool.

16:13.822 --> 16:15.555
It <i>is</i> cool.

16:15.557 --> 16:16.756
So proud.

16:16.758 --> 16:18.024
Alright, so, when Seagel gets here,

16:18.026 --> 16:19.359
we'll just put him down
and take him home.

16:19.361 --> 16:20.360
<i>Easy peasy.</i>

16:20.362 --> 16:21.461
Uh, guys.

16:21.463 --> 16:23.530
<i>Looks like Seagel brought friends.</i>

16:23.532 --> 16:25.098
<i>And they're not dressed for tennis.</i>

16:25.100 --> 16:27.367
Hey. I have this court reserved.

16:27.369 --> 16:29.345
Sorry. She's...
she's holding me hostage here.

16:29.347 --> 16:30.492
Just give us a second.

16:30.494 --> 16:33.506
Right, so, like I was telling
you, remember the forehand.

16:33.508 --> 16:35.575
You go low...

16:35.577 --> 16:36.709
to high.

16:36.711 --> 16:39.012
Oh! Now I get it.

16:49.825 --> 16:51.224
Keep working on that form!

17:00.702 --> 17:02.469
Everyone get down!

17:02.471 --> 17:03.136
Ohh!

17:11.113 --> 17:12.878
Seagel's on the run!

17:14.249 --> 17:15.682
<i>He's headed for the rear exit.</i>

17:18.987 --> 17:20.487
Oh, I'm sorry.

17:20.489 --> 17:21.788
I forgot to say "fore."

17:23.959 --> 17:25.090
Fore, bitch.

17:29.498 --> 17:31.297
Ohh.

17:31.299 --> 17:33.299
Your form needs some work.

17:33.301 --> 17:35.301
That's not what the machine says.

17:45.539 --> 17:47.105
Good morning, sleepy head.

17:47.107 --> 17:48.870
You can try, but those cuffs,

17:48.872 --> 17:50.309
they're gonna be tough to break.

17:50.310 --> 17:51.361
Where am I?

17:51.363 --> 17:53.017
In a bar, about to be charged with

17:53.019 --> 17:54.952
attempted murder of federal officers.

17:54.954 --> 17:55.970
How did I get here?

17:55.972 --> 17:58.555
Oh, I stuck you with
a tennis racket tranquilizer.

17:58.557 --> 18:00.624
And yes... that's a thing.

18:00.626 --> 18:02.465
I-I'm not talking.

18:02.466 --> 18:03.665
We'll see.

18:03.667 --> 18:04.732
Ooh.

18:04.734 --> 18:06.034
That's not good for you.

18:10.640 --> 18:11.906
If I can get him talking,

18:11.908 --> 18:13.174
I'll grill him on the manufacturing

18:13.176 --> 18:14.559
and distribution of the opiates.

18:14.560 --> 18:16.260
If we really want
to bring down the cartel,

18:16.262 --> 18:18.195
we got to get rid of
all the arms of the operation,

18:18.197 --> 18:19.557
or it'll just come back to life.

18:19.559 --> 18:21.432
Right. Frankie's on her way to
Connecticut to pick up Daniel.

18:21.434 --> 18:22.866
I need you guys to take a deeper dive

18:22.868 --> 18:24.335
into those corporate personnel records.

18:24.337 --> 18:26.203
See if there's anybody else
at Daniel's company

18:26.205 --> 18:27.304
we can tie into that cartel.

18:27.306 --> 18:28.939
Wait, work with Standish?

18:28.941 --> 18:30.841
Yeah, I-I'm not sure I can do that.

18:30.843 --> 18:33.310
Given my obsessive need for order

18:33.312 --> 18:35.612
makes it impossible
for me to connect with anyone

18:35.614 --> 18:37.047
at an emotional level.

18:37.049 --> 18:39.183
I'm sorry. Can you handle this
on your own, Standish?

18:39.185 --> 18:40.818
Oh, I'm sorry...
I don't know how to answer that,

18:40.820 --> 18:43.654
because I lack the ability to
make quick decisions in a crisis

18:43.656 --> 18:44.955
due to my insecure nature.

18:44.957 --> 18:46.357
What is happening?

18:46.359 --> 18:47.858
You guys read your evaluations.

18:47.860 --> 18:49.259
Ohh, yeah.

18:49.261 --> 18:50.828
Yeah, and for your information,
I don't seek

18:50.830 --> 18:52.629
the constant approval of my co-workers.

18:52.631 --> 18:53.692
Right, Will?

18:53.694 --> 18:55.085
You don't hear yourself
right now, do you?

18:55.087 --> 18:57.801
<i>This</i> is why I didn't want
you guys to read them.

18:57.803 --> 18:59.403
Is it because they're filled with lies?

18:59.405 --> 19:01.430
Hey, analyzing behavior is Susan's job.

19:01.430 --> 19:02.596
Come on. Grow up.

19:02.598 --> 19:04.064
Ooh! Big words, coming from a man

19:04.066 --> 19:06.266
who is so emotionally invested in his job

19:06.268 --> 19:09.548
that he once risked his life
to save a target's dog.

19:10.508 --> 19:12.072
Yeah, look, Roscoe was a mistake.

19:12.782 --> 19:14.908
Okay? And not just because
my building doesn't allow pets.

19:14.910 --> 19:17.477
I'm grateful to Susan
for pointing that out.

19:18.246 --> 19:19.846
Look, you guys,
I got to go meet Frankie, okay?

19:19.848 --> 19:21.848
Can we drop this and get to work, please?

19:21.850 --> 19:23.083
Fine.

19:23.085 --> 19:24.584
Then I have to go to the bathroom.

19:30.492 --> 19:32.058
Roscoe? You put that in your report?

19:32.060 --> 19:33.460
Come on. That's not cool.

19:34.428 --> 19:35.629
How is Roscoe doing?

19:35.631 --> 19:37.130
Oh, look... the family who adopted him

19:37.132 --> 19:38.565
keeps texting me pictures of him.

19:38.567 --> 19:40.400
Look at this. He's in
a Christmas sweater here.

19:40.402 --> 19:41.434
Check that out.

19:43.371 --> 19:45.071
Alright, I don't trust people
who don't like dogs.

19:45.073 --> 19:46.273
I'm just saying.

19:52.848 --> 19:55.282
Lucky for me, my persistence paid off.

19:55.284 --> 19:57.050
I guess the fifth time was the charm.

19:57.052 --> 19:59.186
She finally agreed
to go on a date with me.

19:59.188 --> 20:01.354
Because playing hard to get is cool.

20:01.356 --> 20:04.057
I have to go get Tommy from soccer.

20:04.059 --> 20:05.859
You better be here when I get back.

20:05.861 --> 20:07.327
- Okay.
- Love you.

20:07.329 --> 20:08.428
Love you, too.

20:08.430 --> 20:10.197
Oh. And make her help you do the dishes.

20:10.199 --> 20:11.831
She always hated doing those.

20:12.459 --> 20:13.893
So, you want to wash or dry?

20:15.837 --> 20:17.704
You're lucky I don't shoot you.

20:18.573 --> 20:20.307
I told everybody I was going to.

20:20.309 --> 20:21.608
Excuse me?

20:21.610 --> 20:23.777
You're a key player
in Eddie Benson's opiate ring.

20:23.779 --> 20:26.313
So you're gonna roll on Benson,
and I'll put him away forever.

20:26.315 --> 20:29.649
And then you'll only have to go to
jail for, like, <i>half</i> of forever.

20:29.651 --> 20:30.817
So that's nice.

20:30.819 --> 20:32.185
I don't know what you're talking about.

20:32.187 --> 20:33.720
Don't play dumb. We have the chemist.

20:33.722 --> 20:35.655
If you prefer, I could wait
until Kelly comes home,

20:35.657 --> 20:37.724
and then the three of us
can do this together...

20:37.726 --> 20:39.326
as a family.

20:43.966 --> 20:45.232
Please don't.

20:45.234 --> 20:46.979
She doesn't know anything.

20:47.369 --> 20:49.502
I swear, when Benson
first asked me for the money,

20:49.504 --> 20:51.371
I didn't even know
what I was investing in.

20:51.373 --> 20:54.975
But when I found out,
I-I didn't stop taking my share.

20:54.977 --> 20:56.776
It was just so much money.

20:56.778 --> 20:59.045
Look, I just want a great life
for Tommy and Kelly.

20:59.047 --> 21:00.117
Are you done?

21:00.144 --> 21:02.349
Or did you want to roll through
a few more excuses?

21:02.351 --> 21:03.954
Look, I'll do whatever you want.

21:04.486 --> 21:06.119
Just let me ask you a favor.

21:06.121 --> 21:07.654
That's not how it works.

21:08.422 --> 21:10.190
Just let Kelly hear it from <i>me.</i>

21:10.192 --> 21:12.392
When she gets home,
I'll tell her everything.

21:13.098 --> 21:14.861
I'll say goodbye to Tommy.

21:14.863 --> 21:16.363
And I'll meet you wherever you want,

21:16.365 --> 21:18.565
and I'll give you
everything I have on Benson.

21:19.145 --> 21:20.433
Please?

21:20.435 --> 21:22.035
For Kelly?

21:23.571 --> 21:24.838
Fine.

21:28.609 --> 21:31.011
Go to this federal building...

21:31.013 --> 21:32.900
and turn yourself in.

21:34.448 --> 21:35.849
Don't try anything.

21:35.851 --> 21:36.950
Or I'll hunt you down.

21:38.220 --> 21:39.586
And I'm still not doing the dishes.

21:50.299 --> 21:51.464
What's that?

21:51.466 --> 21:52.499
Truth serum.

21:52.501 --> 21:53.800
There's no such thing as truth serum.

21:53.802 --> 21:55.201
I know.

21:55.203 --> 21:57.203
After putting together
all the info I could find

21:57.205 --> 21:59.706
on the chemist,
his profile is fairly clear.

21:59.708 --> 22:02.575
He's fiercely loyal,
so he's reluctant to snitch.

22:02.577 --> 22:06.046
But he's also a pragmatist,
and he values self-preservation.

22:06.048 --> 22:08.048
This is just saline.

22:08.050 --> 22:09.649
Give him an excuse to talk

22:09.651 --> 22:11.851
and make him feel like
it's not his fault.

22:11.853 --> 22:13.486
Yeah, that's never gonna work.

22:13.488 --> 22:15.088
Oh. You're right.

22:15.090 --> 22:17.152
I have no idea what I'm doing at all.

22:18.327 --> 22:19.459
Thank you.

22:20.762 --> 22:22.395
I think she was being sarcastic.

22:23.864 --> 22:25.732
This is sodium thiopental,

22:25.734 --> 22:28.535
but you're probably more familiar
with its colloquial name...

22:28.537 --> 22:29.469
truth serum.

22:29.471 --> 22:31.204
You're gonna feel tingling,

22:31.206 --> 22:32.572
mild shortness of breath,
and then we're gonna have

22:32.574 --> 22:33.773
a nice, long conversation.

22:33.775 --> 22:35.909
I told you, I'm not gonna talk.

22:35.911 --> 22:37.544
You won't have a choice.
It's not your fault.

22:37.546 --> 22:39.713
It's just... science.

22:41.983 --> 22:43.249
Looks like it's kicking in.

22:43.251 --> 22:44.517
What's your full name?

22:45.921 --> 22:49.322
Rodney... Nigel Seagel.

22:49.810 --> 22:50.957
Truthful.

22:50.959 --> 22:52.392
Let's jump right in.

22:52.394 --> 22:54.094
Would you say
you only work for powerful men

22:54.096 --> 22:56.496
because you have father issues?

22:56.498 --> 22:58.231
Or because you secretly
get a sexual thrill

22:58.233 --> 22:59.999
out of being subservient?

23:00.901 --> 23:02.364
It's because...

23:03.572 --> 23:05.238
It's both.

23:05.240 --> 23:06.539
Great.

23:06.541 --> 23:08.975
Now we're gonna find out
how a nice chemist like you

23:08.977 --> 23:11.010
got involved in the opiate business.

23:13.013 --> 23:14.514
Holy crap. It's working.

23:14.516 --> 23:17.183
Susan is a scary woman.

23:17.185 --> 23:19.486
Don't you feel that way about <i>all</i> women?

23:19.488 --> 23:22.021
Yes, but particularly with Susan.

23:22.023 --> 23:23.823
Daniel's gonna be here any second.

23:23.825 --> 23:25.225
I called a couple guys from DEA

23:25.227 --> 23:26.812
to come bring him into custody
once he's here.

23:26.814 --> 23:28.410
That's great. Hey,

23:28.412 --> 23:31.030
I need you to take a
look at this intel for me.

23:31.032 --> 23:32.031
Cornrows?

23:32.033 --> 23:33.099
No way.

23:33.101 --> 23:34.167
I know, right?

23:35.302 --> 23:36.403
Spring break.

23:36.405 --> 23:37.704
You look... pretty.

23:40.142 --> 23:41.708
Daniel, where are you?

23:41.710 --> 23:43.243
I called Benson.

23:43.245 --> 23:45.512
I told him it was an emergency
and I need to see him.

23:45.514 --> 23:47.680
I promise once he gets here,
I'll bring him right to you.

23:47.682 --> 23:50.116
W-W... Daniel, wait a second.
That... That's a terrible idea.

23:50.118 --> 23:51.551
Benson is an extremely dangerous person.

23:51.553 --> 23:53.186
I think it's better if you just come...

23:53.188 --> 23:54.721
<i>I have to do this for Kelly and Tommy.</i>

23:54.723 --> 23:55.989
I need to make this right.

23:55.991 --> 23:57.223
<i>No, Daniel, wait a second.</i>

23:57.225 --> 23:58.158
Da...

23:58.160 --> 23:59.626
Gaaah!

23:59.628 --> 24:01.327
Probably should've brought him
in when you had him.

24:02.876 --> 24:04.731
That's not a helpful thing to say.

24:04.733 --> 24:05.832
No, Ray.

24:05.834 --> 24:07.400
Look, it's gonna be fine.

24:07.402 --> 24:09.636
Daniel is a smart guy.
This will all work out.

24:09.638 --> 24:12.739
If goes and gets himself killed,
Kelly will never forgive me.

24:23.018 --> 24:24.717
Daniel.

24:24.719 --> 24:25.685
Benson.

24:28.423 --> 24:30.623
Thank you for coming so quickly.

24:30.625 --> 24:32.392
Mm.

24:32.394 --> 24:35.249
When the boss says jump, you jump.

24:36.565 --> 24:38.698
What can I do for you, sir?

24:38.700 --> 24:39.666
Just this.

24:51.446 --> 24:53.379
Daniel. What happened?

24:53.381 --> 24:55.721
Nothing. Benson never showed.

24:55.723 --> 24:57.461
Don't worry about that. We'll get him.

24:57.463 --> 24:59.419
No more stunts like that, okay?

24:59.421 --> 25:01.754
These men are gonna take you to
the DEA office for questioning.

25:01.756 --> 25:03.990
Thank you for being so kind.

25:03.992 --> 25:05.358
I just...

25:05.360 --> 25:06.960
I just want to make this right.

25:06.962 --> 25:09.696
Look, we're just glad
you're okay. Alright?

25:09.698 --> 25:10.964
Thank you, guys.

25:10.966 --> 25:12.398
They'll take care of you.

25:15.058 --> 25:17.780
Okay, so, the distribution is mostly run

25:17.805 --> 25:19.571
through company trucking lines,

25:19.573 --> 25:21.905
lowering the risk of the pills
being intercepted by the police.

25:24.189 --> 25:26.214
Hey. Great news. You can wrap this up,

25:26.216 --> 25:27.483
send this gentleman over to the DEA.

25:27.485 --> 25:28.956
Daniel decided to roll on his own.

25:28.957 --> 25:30.030
It's over.

25:30.032 --> 25:32.839
Daniel's being driven to a
federal prosecutor as we speak.

25:32.841 --> 25:35.075
He's gonna testify
against your boss... Benson.

25:35.077 --> 25:36.777
W... Benson?

25:36.779 --> 25:37.811
W...

25:38.847 --> 25:40.280
What are you talking about?

25:41.228 --> 25:42.962
Daniel runs everything.

25:42.987 --> 25:44.720
He's the financial guy, yes, but...

25:44.745 --> 25:46.745
No. Benson is a nobody.

25:46.770 --> 25:48.451
Daniel <i>is</i> the cartel.

25:51.821 --> 25:53.239
We're on our way.

25:53.264 --> 25:55.879
The officers moving Daniel were
found dead in a parking garage.

25:55.904 --> 25:56.910
Let's move.

25:56.935 --> 25:58.614
Alright, hey, while we're
on the road to Connecticut,

25:58.614 --> 26:00.348
see if you guys can
pinpoint Daniel's location...

26:00.350 --> 26:01.916
cellphone towers,
credit card transactions...

26:01.918 --> 26:02.917
anything you can think of.

26:02.919 --> 26:04.185
- On it.
- Thank you.

26:04.187 --> 26:05.753
I'm gonna finish questioning Seagel.

26:05.755 --> 26:07.021
Can someone contact Justice

26:07.023 --> 26:09.343
about transferring him
to a secure location?

26:13.138 --> 26:15.596
Oh, you guys aren't speaking to me?

26:15.598 --> 26:18.466
What? No! That would be crazy.

26:18.468 --> 26:20.010
But since you want to take
all the personal things

26:20.035 --> 26:21.028
that we say and use it against us,

26:21.030 --> 26:22.269
we're gonna be a little bit more careful.

26:22.271 --> 26:24.171
Yeah, we're just gonna
limit our interactions

26:24.173 --> 26:26.273
to a couple of pre-approved topics.

26:27.943 --> 26:30.578
The weather, lunch, and the time of day?

26:30.580 --> 26:31.712
It is...

26:31.714 --> 26:32.913
5:30.

26:32.915 --> 26:34.548
Oh, that's one of my favorite times.

26:34.550 --> 26:35.750
I'm a 6:00 a.m. guy.

26:35.752 --> 26:37.051
- Really?
- I like garbage trucks.

26:37.053 --> 26:38.853
I'm updating your profiles.

26:38.855 --> 26:41.022
And under "Dominant characteristics,"

26:41.024 --> 26:44.920
I'm going to put "childish" and "stupid"!

26:46.261 --> 26:47.862
I'm assuming <i>I'm</i> childish.

26:49.832 --> 26:51.732
Ha ha! Whoo!

26:51.734 --> 26:53.200
Outstanding!

26:53.202 --> 26:54.769
What are you so happy about, Ray?

26:54.771 --> 26:56.270
W... Well, that was the first time

26:56.272 --> 26:58.906
Susan has used the words
"childish" and "stupid"

26:58.908 --> 27:01.409
and not been referring to the Ray-dog!

27:01.411 --> 27:02.910
Whoo! High five!

27:03.845 --> 27:05.479
Too slow. Gotcha.

27:05.481 --> 27:08.115
Listen, I'm guessing that
this probably isn't a great time

27:08.117 --> 27:12.153
to, uh, ask you if you tracked
down that buyer from L.A. yet?

27:14.557 --> 27:16.357
Knew it wasn't a great time.

27:16.359 --> 27:19.326
Alright, I'll see
you stupid children later.

27:21.464 --> 27:23.330
Okay, that can't stick
and become a thing.

27:23.332 --> 27:24.632
It's catchy.

27:29.839 --> 27:31.372
Hey, guys.

27:31.374 --> 27:33.407
We already checked the house.
Kelly, where's Daniel?

27:33.409 --> 27:35.681
He said he needed
to zip by one of his offices.

27:35.683 --> 27:37.046
- What's going on?
- I'll go get the car.

27:37.048 --> 27:38.479
- I'll come with you.
- No. Tell her.

27:39.850 --> 27:41.333
Look, I don't have a lot of time.

27:41.335 --> 27:43.101
You and Tommy are in danger.

27:43.103 --> 27:45.637
The real reason that I'm in town...

27:45.639 --> 27:47.673
is because Daniel's not
who you think he is.

27:48.474 --> 27:50.208
He runs a very violent drug cartel.

27:50.210 --> 27:52.110
Well, that's got to be a mistake.

27:52.112 --> 27:53.312
My husband's not a criminal.

27:53.314 --> 27:55.247
He is. He's also a murderer.

27:55.249 --> 27:57.482
Oh, this is ridiculous.
I don't believe you.

27:57.484 --> 27:59.451
I got to go.

27:59.453 --> 28:01.987
Look, it's me. Trust me.

28:01.989 --> 28:03.221
Trust you?

28:03.223 --> 28:05.357
I haven't heard from you in years.

28:05.359 --> 28:07.526
You've never responded
to any of my letters.

28:07.528 --> 28:09.461
You've obviously been lying to me

28:09.463 --> 28:11.296
since the second you got here.

28:11.298 --> 28:13.076
- Kelly...
- No, you can't just waltz in

28:13.101 --> 28:14.333
and ruin my life.

28:14.335 --> 28:16.201
I won't let you do it.

28:16.203 --> 28:18.470
You're not part of this family.

28:20.640 --> 28:22.607
Suit yourself.

28:22.609 --> 28:24.376
I tried to warn you.

28:33.087 --> 28:34.319
Copy that.

28:34.321 --> 28:35.454
Will and Frankie are three minutes out

28:35.456 --> 28:36.955
from Daniel's Stamford office.

28:36.957 --> 28:38.423
Well, Daniel's definitely there.

28:38.425 --> 28:39.825
I hacked the company's network,

28:39.827 --> 28:41.960
and he's deleting all the files
off the main server.

28:41.962 --> 28:43.428
He's trying to cover his tracks.

28:43.430 --> 28:45.497
I just knocked out security
cameras to the building.

28:45.499 --> 28:47.399
He'll never see Will and Frankie coming.

28:47.401 --> 28:48.233
Nice work.

28:48.235 --> 28:49.735
Oh! Yeah, one more thing.

28:49.737 --> 28:51.970
Tracked down the location
of the L.A. buyer that got away.

28:51.972 --> 28:53.605
It took me four seconds.

28:53.607 --> 28:55.874
You should really learn the
<i>littlest</i> bit about technology.

28:55.876 --> 28:57.209
Thank you.

28:57.211 --> 28:59.544
Will's gonna be so stoked!

28:59.546 --> 29:01.817
I mean, this is game-changer, baby.

29:01.819 --> 29:03.949
Ray, what exactly do you think
is gonna happen

29:03.951 --> 29:05.250
when you hand that to Will?

29:05.252 --> 29:09.855
♪ Reunited, and it feels so good ♪

29:09.857 --> 29:11.356
I'm just kidding.

29:11.358 --> 29:13.225
You know, I might be
a little bit ahead of myself.

29:13.227 --> 29:15.794
But I give this to Will,
he's gonna be grateful.

29:15.796 --> 29:18.263
I'm immediately gonna say, "Hey,
you want to grab some dinner?"

29:18.265 --> 29:20.065
- He can't say no...
- Ray.

29:20.067 --> 29:21.800
Can I offer you a little bit of advice?

29:21.802 --> 29:23.668
Many have tried.

29:23.670 --> 29:25.904
Just play it cool, man.

29:25.906 --> 29:26.938
For once.

29:28.308 --> 29:29.474
So I shouldn't wrap this up
like a present?

29:31.011 --> 29:33.178
They're transporting Seagel
over to the DEA.

29:33.180 --> 29:36.214
I'll probably drive over there
to help with the debrief.

29:37.008 --> 29:39.951
Unless, of course, you guys...

29:39.953 --> 29:41.820
need me here for something?

29:42.305 --> 29:43.473
We're good.

29:44.330 --> 29:45.730
Have a great day.

29:47.360 --> 29:48.860
Okay.

29:48.862 --> 29:50.397
Thanks.

29:52.832 --> 29:54.933
Wow. That was harsh.

29:54.935 --> 29:57.080
What are you talking about, Ray?

29:57.082 --> 29:59.538
Well, she's obviously trying
to make up with you guys.

29:59.540 --> 30:01.206
You know, it's funny.

30:01.208 --> 30:03.341
Here I am, working so hard
to get my friend back,

30:03.343 --> 30:06.211
and you guys are working so hard
to <i>lose</i> yours.

30:07.079 --> 30:08.580
I can't believe Ray has a point.

30:08.582 --> 30:10.061
This is a new low.

30:11.785 --> 30:13.318
Will and Frankie are on-site.

30:14.354 --> 30:15.454
Look, you just have to look at it

30:15.456 --> 30:16.988
from Kelly's point of view, right?

30:16.990 --> 30:18.123
She finally puts together
this family, which...

30:18.125 --> 30:19.491
Oh, my God!

30:19.493 --> 30:21.526
You blabbed about this
the whole way here.

30:21.528 --> 30:23.028
No more about Kelly.

30:26.466 --> 30:28.733
I know it didn't go the way you
wanted it to with Kelly, right?

30:28.735 --> 30:31.336
But you showed her a lot of
compassion by trying to warn her.

30:31.338 --> 30:32.938
You should feel good about that.

30:32.940 --> 30:34.539
I don't. I feel horrible.

30:34.541 --> 30:36.808
Can we please concentrate
on putting this bastard away?

30:36.810 --> 30:38.577
Yeah, alright.

30:39.979 --> 30:41.680
Why are you smiling?

30:41.682 --> 30:43.181
Me? I'm not smiling.

30:43.183 --> 30:44.583
I'm... It's my resting face.

30:44.585 --> 30:46.485
I have resting smile face, I guess.

30:50.924 --> 30:52.290
We've got company.

30:54.460 --> 30:56.428
Alright, I'm gonna let you
call the play this time,

30:56.430 --> 30:57.996
and I'm gonna do the opposite of that.

30:57.998 --> 30:58.997
Grow up.

31:02.001 --> 31:03.136
Hey.

31:03.636 --> 31:05.103
You want to build a snowman?

31:09.877 --> 31:11.243
What's with the snowman crap?

31:11.245 --> 31:12.310
Oh, I was listening
to the "Frozen" soundtrack

31:12.312 --> 31:13.845
this morning during my workout.

31:16.582 --> 31:18.583
Come on. Musicals give me
an endorphin rush.

31:18.585 --> 31:20.737
It's great for cardio. You should try it.

31:22.321 --> 31:24.055
You are <i>so</i> sexy.

31:24.057 --> 31:25.690
Come on.

31:27.326 --> 31:28.727
- Cover me.
- Yep.

31:44.912 --> 31:46.545
Going somewhere?

31:47.713 --> 31:50.582
I don't suppose you would just
take some of this and walk away?

31:50.584 --> 31:52.918
Your future ex-wife
raised me better than that.

31:52.920 --> 31:54.486
Fair enough.

31:55.589 --> 31:56.721
She's all yours, Wayne.

32:00.994 --> 32:02.427
Good night.

32:35.361 --> 32:36.661
You okay?

32:36.663 --> 32:38.196
Did you get Daniel?

32:38.198 --> 32:39.864
No. I heard you getting your ass kicked,

32:39.866 --> 32:41.232
and I came in here to help.

32:41.234 --> 32:43.835
Hey! Just like you did with me in L.A.

32:43.837 --> 32:46.104
Weird how <i>I'm</i> not all bent
out of shape about it, huh?

32:46.106 --> 32:48.239
You should've gotten Daniel.
I can take care of myself.

32:48.241 --> 32:49.608
Yeah, no, I took out my three guys

32:49.610 --> 32:52.043
while you were losing to <i>one</i> in here.

32:53.045 --> 32:54.379
Daniel sure had a lot of backup.

32:54.381 --> 32:56.214
It's almost like
they knew we were coming.

32:57.850 --> 32:59.584
Kelly.

32:59.586 --> 33:01.086
She tipped him off.

33:05.879 --> 33:08.211
I tried to help you, and you betrayed me.

33:08.236 --> 33:10.315
Kelly, I know that you tipped Daniel off.

33:10.340 --> 33:12.572
That's obstruction of justice.
You know that!

33:12.599 --> 33:16.001
You could lose your job,
your son... everything.

33:16.003 --> 33:17.502
This was all a misunderstanding.

33:17.504 --> 33:19.337
Daniel explained it all to me.

33:19.339 --> 33:20.896
He just got in over his head financially

33:20.898 --> 33:22.389
with some bad people.

33:22.390 --> 33:23.489
He tried to murder me.

33:23.491 --> 33:26.291
Us. Technically, he tried to murder <i>us.</i>

33:26.293 --> 33:29.495
Frankie, I would never put you in danger.

33:29.497 --> 33:31.230
You did.

33:32.799 --> 33:34.967
I'm just saying, I was there, too.

33:34.969 --> 33:37.803
No, he's the father of my child.

33:38.805 --> 33:40.105
I shouldn't have warned him,

33:40.107 --> 33:41.840
but haven't you ever broken the rules

33:41.842 --> 33:43.375
for someone you care about?

33:43.377 --> 33:45.110
Yes.

33:45.879 --> 33:47.446
And I'll never do it again.

33:51.930 --> 33:54.620
The good news is that now
Daniel trusts you completely,

33:54.622 --> 33:56.518
so you're gonna call him...

33:57.191 --> 33:59.191
and tell him that
you want to run away together...

33:59.193 --> 34:01.272
and totally set him up for us.

34:01.796 --> 34:04.129
I'll do anything that you need.

34:04.131 --> 34:06.365
I'm so sorry, Frankie.

34:07.333 --> 34:08.833
Frankie!

34:10.536 --> 34:11.704
She'll get over this.

34:11.706 --> 34:13.409
You know how Frankie is.

34:14.607 --> 34:16.475
Yeah. I do.

34:36.429 --> 34:37.629
Hey, you!

34:37.630 --> 34:38.797
Let's go.

34:38.799 --> 34:40.431
I got a private plane waiting.

34:41.467 --> 34:42.735
Where's Tommy?

34:46.005 --> 34:47.473
Kelly, what did you do?

34:52.045 --> 34:53.779
Let me see your hands!

34:56.315 --> 34:58.350
It's over, you son of a bitch.

34:58.352 --> 34:59.718
Kelly.

34:59.720 --> 35:01.453
I knew I couldn't trust you.

35:02.489 --> 35:03.622
Now!

35:07.795 --> 35:09.862
Man. Does he buy these guys in bulk?

35:09.864 --> 35:11.797
He's making a run for it.

35:11.799 --> 35:13.298
Alright, you go after him. I got Kelly.

35:13.300 --> 35:14.345
Go.

35:17.371 --> 35:18.604
Aaaaaaah!

35:18.606 --> 35:19.705
You okay?

35:19.707 --> 35:21.173
I think I want a divorce.

35:21.175 --> 35:22.941
That's a big decision. You might
want to think about it.

35:24.745 --> 35:25.811
Pretty sure.

35:25.813 --> 35:27.212
Ugh!

35:27.214 --> 35:28.280
Fair enough.

35:45.465 --> 35:46.765
They got us outnumbered.

35:46.767 --> 35:48.033
I want you to go around,
get in the front seat,

35:48.035 --> 35:49.468
stay down, and put the car in reverse.

35:49.470 --> 35:50.569
Okay? I'll cover you.

35:50.571 --> 35:51.670
Okay.

35:51.672 --> 35:52.771
I think you're very brave.

35:52.773 --> 35:53.872
Thank you.

35:53.874 --> 35:55.574
And maybe a little stupid.

35:55.576 --> 35:56.842
Okay.

35:56.844 --> 35:57.910
I can see why Frankie's so into you.

35:57.912 --> 35:59.411
Sh... No. We're partners.

35:59.413 --> 36:00.658
Uh-huh. Okay.

36:00.660 --> 36:01.814
- Alright, ready?
- Yeah.

36:01.816 --> 36:02.818
Go.

36:26.774 --> 36:28.040
Wow.

36:28.042 --> 36:29.641
That was impressive even for <i>me.</i>

36:29.643 --> 36:32.611
Hey, Kelly, when we see Frankie,
you got to tell her that...

36:32.613 --> 36:34.379
Kelly?

36:44.425 --> 36:47.459
Drop your gun and you kick it over to me.

36:47.461 --> 36:48.493
Now.

36:49.562 --> 36:50.729
Now!

36:58.205 --> 37:00.539
I-I'm sorry it had to end this way.

37:00.541 --> 37:02.207
Daniel!

37:02.209 --> 37:03.408
Kelly, don't!

37:03.410 --> 37:05.043
Kelly, what the hell are you doing?

37:05.045 --> 37:06.979
I almost let you hurt her once.

37:06.981 --> 37:08.714
I won't let it happen again.

37:08.716 --> 37:09.982
Don't come near me.

37:09.984 --> 37:11.850
How can you do this to us?

37:11.852 --> 37:13.185
To Tommy?

37:13.187 --> 37:15.020
K... I-I don't want to shoot you,
but I will.

37:16.457 --> 37:17.756
No.

37:17.758 --> 37:19.424
Think of our son.

37:19.426 --> 37:22.527
The man I fell in love with
is still in there somewhere.

37:30.169 --> 37:31.470
I'm sorry.

37:33.840 --> 37:36.108
That's for not realizing what you had.

37:38.845 --> 37:40.512
Hands behind your back.

37:54.313 --> 37:55.565
Thanks for the ride home.

37:55.606 --> 37:56.504
Yeah, you bet.

37:56.506 --> 37:57.873
Hey, you guys hungry?

37:59.569 --> 38:01.236
You want a minute. Alright.

38:02.096 --> 38:04.720
I know that you were
trying to protect me,

38:04.722 --> 38:06.642
but you didn't need
to stand in front of that gun.

38:07.335 --> 38:09.378
Look, I've been wanting
to tell you something.

38:09.557 --> 38:12.191
My life got so much better

38:12.216 --> 38:14.783
once I stopped being so closed off.

38:16.753 --> 38:18.287
After all this?

38:18.946 --> 38:20.789
Yeah... still.

38:23.144 --> 38:24.444
And I know you.

38:24.469 --> 38:26.469
Once you start caring for someone,

38:26.471 --> 38:28.671
you run off in the other direction.

38:30.053 --> 38:31.487
Yeah.

38:31.512 --> 38:33.878
You lose enough people
that you love, it...

38:35.413 --> 38:36.846
seems safer.

38:37.882 --> 38:38.915
I get it.

38:38.917 --> 38:40.093
I get it.

38:40.752 --> 38:43.186
Promise me you won't let
what happened to me

38:43.188 --> 38:45.640
stop you from letting love
back in your life.

38:46.424 --> 38:47.690
I'll try.

38:47.692 --> 38:50.603
And maybe we can have dinner soon?

38:51.663 --> 38:52.939
Yeah. I'll call you.

38:53.598 --> 38:54.997
Will you?

38:54.999 --> 38:56.477
Maybe.

38:56.479 --> 38:58.134
Probably.

38:58.794 --> 39:00.028
Yes.

39:00.321 --> 39:01.771
Love you.

39:01.773 --> 39:03.039
Love you.

39:04.007 --> 39:05.808
Aww. Wow.

39:05.810 --> 39:07.577
Hey, I found an apple.

39:08.812 --> 39:10.580
You want a hug?

39:10.706 --> 39:12.048
Yeah, you know it!

39:12.050 --> 39:13.049
Come on.

39:13.051 --> 39:14.684
- Seriously?
- What?

39:14.686 --> 39:16.486
He never learns.

39:16.488 --> 39:17.987
Hey, I just saved your life.

39:17.989 --> 39:19.589
I've saved <i>yours a bunch of times.</i>

39:19.591 --> 39:21.057
No, you didn't. I don't remember it.

39:21.059 --> 39:22.225
Oh, did you say, "No, I didn't"?

39:22.227 --> 39:23.426
Yeah. Are you kidding me?

39:23.428 --> 39:24.961
Oh, let me count the ways.

39:24.963 --> 39:26.329
I didn't need you to be there.

39:31.269 --> 39:33.202
Why did you guys text me
to meet you here?

39:33.204 --> 39:35.738
Just watch and be amazed.

39:35.740 --> 39:38.107
Not something you say
to a woman in a bathroom.

39:42.747 --> 39:44.080
Whoa.

39:44.082 --> 39:45.581
You have a secret lair?

39:45.583 --> 39:46.682
Yeah, we built it.

39:48.219 --> 39:49.952
<i>Jai</i> built it.

39:49.954 --> 39:51.554
Oh!

39:51.556 --> 39:52.688
Whoa!

39:52.690 --> 39:57.059
So, showing you this is a metaphor.

39:57.061 --> 39:58.427
We're friends.

39:58.429 --> 40:00.129
We don't have to hide anything
from each other.

40:00.131 --> 40:02.431
Ohhh. Thanks, guys.

40:02.433 --> 40:04.166
You know, I think we should
have a drink to celebrate.

40:04.168 --> 40:05.635
- Yeah.
- Yes!

40:05.637 --> 40:07.470
Great idea.

40:08.639 --> 40:10.438
- Wait, how do you know about...
- Oh, please.

40:10.440 --> 40:12.808
I know you better
than you know yourselves.

40:12.810 --> 40:15.444
I've known about this place for months.

40:16.046 --> 40:17.613
She's a witch.

40:19.967 --> 40:21.403
To a mission well done.

40:21.405 --> 40:23.553
Mm-hmm.

40:23.555 --> 40:25.187
Mm. About that.

40:25.189 --> 40:27.690
Are we gonna mention in the report
that Kelly tipped off Daniel?

40:27.692 --> 40:30.259
Um... I was thinking of leaving that out.

40:30.261 --> 40:33.053
You know, so she can keep her
son and her job and everything.

40:33.055 --> 40:34.148
Mm-hmm.

40:34.150 --> 40:35.965
Everybody makes mistakes, right?

40:36.967 --> 40:39.368
Good to show compassion once in a while.

40:39.963 --> 40:41.597
Yes, it is.

40:43.140 --> 40:44.440
Are you okay?

40:45.709 --> 40:48.644
I'm just so... so moved
right now. I can't...

40:50.325 --> 40:52.281
Hey, where are Jai
and Standish and Susan?

40:52.283 --> 40:54.755
Oh, I saw them
go to the bathroom together.

40:54.757 --> 40:56.164
W... Oh.

40:56.166 --> 40:58.020
Hey, here's that info you wanted

40:58.022 --> 40:59.487
on that buyer who shook you in L.A.

40:59.489 --> 41:01.102
Oh, right. Thank you, Ray.

41:01.104 --> 41:02.652
No problemo.

41:04.661 --> 41:07.996
What, no speech or lame attempt
to win me over here?

41:08.299 --> 41:10.333
Mm, no.

41:10.421 --> 41:11.654
Hmm?

41:12.003 --> 41:13.536
Alright.

41:13.561 --> 41:15.327
Thank you, Ray.

41:17.567 --> 41:18.800
Shall we?

41:19.363 --> 41:21.153
- Yes.
- Yeah?

41:24.732 --> 41:26.065
Is it <i>ever</i> sunny in L.A.?

41:26.090 --> 41:28.156
Man, you are fast when you want revenge.

41:28.181 --> 41:29.514
This was fun.

41:29.539 --> 41:31.239
Hey, can we go on the Ferris wheel now?

41:31.264 --> 41:32.796
We'd have to take this guy with us.

41:32.821 --> 41:34.454
I'm okay with that.
