00:02.840 --> 00:07.680
This programme contains adult humour
and strong language

00:12.560 --> 00:16.080
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Mrs Brown's Boys.

00:16.080 --> 00:19.520
# She's Mrs Brown

00:19.520 --> 00:21.480
# That's Mrs Brown

00:21.480 --> 00:24.440
# Our Mrs Brown... #

00:27.360 --> 00:28.400
Bitch.

00:30.800 --> 00:33.960
They're not real.
Well, one of them might be.

00:36.760 --> 00:40.280
Hello, I am just looking at
some of the models in this.

00:40.280 --> 00:43.640
My God, what they need is a good
feed! There's not a pick on them.

00:43.640 --> 00:46.840
There's one of them in here that
looks like a feckin' X-ray!

00:46.840 --> 00:49.360
There wouldn't be enough elastic
in her knickers

00:49.360 --> 00:51.320
to make a pair of garters
for a budgie.

00:51.320 --> 00:55.520
If you could call them knickers,
two strings with a label.

00:55.520 --> 00:58.760
In my day we wore real knickers -
Aertex.

00:58.760 --> 01:01.200
HE CHUCKLES

01:01.200 --> 01:05.480
Little pin-holes in them. My husband
couldn't look at a teabag,

01:05.480 --> 01:06.800
but he wanted to do it!

01:10.560 --> 01:12.680
Hiya, Mammy. Hello, honey bunny.

01:15.120 --> 01:19.120
You just missed a call from your
boss. I told him you'd call
as soon as you get in.

01:19.120 --> 01:22.120
That bastard. Why love, what's wrong?
Next week

01:22.120 --> 01:26.280
is Kids Intercontinental Comic Book
and Cosmic Charac Festival Week.

01:26.280 --> 01:30.080
You must have shit yourself
when saw that in the script!

01:33.000 --> 01:35.400
Would you like to have another
go at it?

01:35.400 --> 01:38.480
Next week is

01:38.480 --> 01:40.880
Kids Intercontinental Comic...
Ah, feckin' hell!

01:45.240 --> 01:48.480
Now, now, now. That's bad language
for a rabbit.

01:48.480 --> 01:50.440
Ah, da, da, da, da tet-ta.

01:50.440 --> 01:52.160
Next week is

01:52.160 --> 01:56.800
Kids Intercontinental Comic Book and
Cosmic Character Festival Week.

01:56.800 --> 01:59.080
AUDIENCE APPLAUDS

01:59.080 --> 02:03.800
I love when that comes around
every year. What is it again?

02:06.160 --> 02:10.040
I'm supposed to be promoting
kids' comics,

02:10.040 --> 02:13.640
and he wants me as a different
superhero every day.

02:13.640 --> 02:16.520
Oh, Dermot, that'll be marvellous.
I'm not doing it! Why not?

02:16.520 --> 02:21.400
The kids will love that. And I can't
think of anyone who'd look better as
a superhero than my son.

02:21.400 --> 02:24.960
Mammy, I have to get the bus into
town every day dressed like this.

02:24.960 --> 02:28.320
You're lucky, dressed like that,
he doesn't make you

02:28.320 --> 02:30.120
run in front of a greyhound!

02:30.120 --> 02:32.800
BARKS LIKE A DOG

02:32.800 --> 02:36.480
I'm sorry, son. It's bad enough now,
you can imagine the slagging

02:36.480 --> 02:38.800
I'd get dressed as Spider-Man.

02:39.800 --> 02:43.880
Yeah, trying to get on the bus with
all them legs!

02:43.880 --> 02:46.720
At least with those costumes
you can put an overcoat on.

02:46.720 --> 02:49.440
You can't with the big ones.
You're right, you know. I am.

02:49.440 --> 02:51.720
Now, cup of tea? No, Ma.

02:53.040 --> 02:56.360
Fine. Hey, Ma, there's a new shop
opened in the main shopping centre.

02:56.360 --> 03:00.040
Just what we need, a new feckin'
shop. It's called Fuller Fashions.

03:00.040 --> 03:03.080
Is it? It's nice,
I'd say you'd love it. Would I?

03:03.080 --> 03:06.000
They do lovely clothes for fat women.

03:11.080 --> 03:15.560
And why would I like that?
Well, you know,

03:15.560 --> 03:18.000
in case you wanted to get
something nice for Winnie.

03:21.440 --> 03:27.040
Very good. That's very good.
You're not suggesting that I would
go into such an establishment...

03:27.040 --> 03:30.160
Bejesus, no, Mammy.
You'd be too skinny for that stuff.

03:30.160 --> 03:33.480
I would, wouldn't I?
I would be much too feckin' skinny.

03:33.480 --> 03:36.000
It was nearly fucking rabbit season.

03:37.680 --> 03:40.440
Rory and Dino will be
home for their break, soon.

03:40.440 --> 03:44.240
Oh, now, the Banger Sisters.
Ha, the Banger Sisters.

03:44.240 --> 03:47.240
That's cos they like the sausages.

03:49.520 --> 03:50.920
Doesn't matter, Mammy.

03:52.760 --> 03:57.560
Hey, Dermot. Hi, Dermot. Hey, lads.
I'm here, Mammy.

03:57.560 --> 04:01.000
Do you want a cup of tea? No thanks.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.760
No, Mammy, I just came home
to drop off my bag.

04:03.760 --> 04:06.160
Well, you're not feckin'
leaving him here.

04:08.640 --> 04:12.520
We're heading down to Foley's for a
little drink. Foley's, at this hour?

04:12.520 --> 04:17.040
Well, it's a kind of a celebration.
Celebrating what? Can I tell them?

04:17.040 --> 04:20.600
Oh, go on then. There was a big
announcement in work today.

04:20.600 --> 04:24.200
What announcement? Well,
the owner... Mr Kavanagh.

04:24.200 --> 04:26.320
..of the salon...
Wash And Blow.

04:26.320 --> 04:29.760
..announced today that instead
of bringing in a new manager,

04:29.760 --> 04:32.400
he was going to promote
someone from within the shop.

04:32.400 --> 04:34.320
Rory, that's a marvellous
opportunity.

04:34.320 --> 04:37.560
I've always said Mr Kavanagh is
a very intelligent and generous man.

04:37.560 --> 04:39.760
And Dino is the favourite to get it.

04:39.760 --> 04:43.320
He's a bastard that man,
I never liked him.

04:43.320 --> 04:45.320
We'll see now Rory,
let's wait and see.

04:45.320 --> 04:47.080
Yeah, well, we can only hope.

04:47.080 --> 04:50.320
You know you're going to get it.

04:50.320 --> 04:54.200
Still, you're right, I suppose, it's
not over till the fat lady sings.

04:54.200 --> 04:57.240
Clear your throat there, Mrs Brown!

04:59.760 --> 05:05.360
Excuse me?! We better go!
You skinny, Scottish bastard!

05:09.000 --> 05:13.920
Right, I'm off, Mammy. Dermot, son...

05:13.920 --> 05:17.600
here, that's for later,
don't tell anyone.

05:22.200 --> 05:26.960
Go on, do it for me. Ah, Ma. Do it
for your mammy, just once, please.

05:26.960 --> 05:29.800
Der-der-der-der-that's all, folks.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.080
And, Dermot, think about the
superhero thing,

05:41.080 --> 05:43.160
I think it would be nice.

05:43.160 --> 05:45.720
What's the superhero thing? Dermot.

05:45.720 --> 05:49.960
It's Intercontinental Kids Comic
and Cosmic Character Week.

05:52.360 --> 05:54.680
It's what?

05:59.480 --> 06:01.640
DERMOT LAUGHS

06:09.440 --> 06:11.640
And Dermot doesn't want to
be a superhero.

06:11.640 --> 06:16.280
Not wanting to be a superhero may
indicate his unwillingness to
take on responsibility.

06:16.280 --> 06:22.000
I know where this is coming from,
Cathy. Professor Clown. It's Clowne.

06:22.000 --> 06:26.440
C-L-O-W-N-E, Clowne, it's Swiss.

06:26.440 --> 06:29.360
C-L-O-W-N-E is clown in
any fucking language.

06:30.840 --> 06:34.800
Even in euros. You're even starting
to sound like him.

06:34.800 --> 06:37.440
Cathy, is there something going
on there? Maybe.

06:37.440 --> 06:39.720
He's asked me out on a date.

06:39.720 --> 06:43.040
I don't think that a professor
should be seeing his students.

06:43.040 --> 06:48.520
And I am going. It's your life, love,
you're entitled to fuck it up
anyway you like.

06:48.520 --> 06:52.040
Well, excuse me, if I take a pass
on your dating advice.

06:52.040 --> 06:54.120
Well, you excuse me.

06:54.120 --> 06:58.760
I'll have you know, missy, in my day
I was considered a bit of a catch.

06:58.760 --> 07:01.000
You may not think it now.
Oh no, Mammy.

07:01.000 --> 07:04.040
You're still a fine looking
woman. I know.

07:04.040 --> 07:06.120
I just said that
to feckin' be humble.

07:07.480 --> 07:09.320
Even with the extra weight.

07:13.360 --> 07:18.240
I think the place could be cleaner.
What do you think? Um-hm. Yes.

07:18.240 --> 07:20.880
I think if everyone done a little
bit of sweeping,

07:20.880 --> 07:23.200
even the stylists,
if they're not too busy.

07:23.200 --> 07:26.160
The stylists, sweeping,
that's interesting.

07:26.160 --> 07:30.440
I think that steriliser
should be cleaned more as well.

07:30.440 --> 07:33.040
It's filthy, full of hair.

07:36.520 --> 07:41.000
It's comfy over here. Yes it is, son,
that's why it's my fucking chair.

07:42.880 --> 07:46.200
Thanks, Mrs Brown. Dermott will be
home in a couple of minutes.

07:46.200 --> 07:49.600
In the meantime,
everything in this room is counted.

07:49.600 --> 07:53.680
Mrs Brown? What?
I'd love a cream cake.

07:53.680 --> 07:57.360
Yeah, I'd love
a holiday in fucking Spain.

07:57.360 --> 08:00.400
Also, I think there's far too
many smoke breaks.

08:00.400 --> 08:05.080
But, Rory, you don't smoke.
That's not my fault. Uh-huh.

08:07.360 --> 08:09.320
You're here, thanks for waiting.

08:09.320 --> 08:12.080
No problemo, Dermo.
Give me a second.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.920
I'm home, Mammy.
I'll inform the press.

08:15.920 --> 08:19.960
How are you, Dino?
Congratulations on the promotion.

08:19.960 --> 08:21.680
Oh, rub it in, why don't you?

08:21.680 --> 08:23.880
HE SOBS

08:25.960 --> 08:32.440
What did I say?
He didn't get the promotion. I did!

08:33.840 --> 08:36.000
I'll see you later...

08:36.000 --> 08:38.200
Manager.

08:38.200 --> 08:40.600
So, Dermo, what you want me for?

08:40.600 --> 08:45.600
I wanted to see if you fancied doing
Robin next week? Yeah.

08:47.520 --> 08:48.800
Where are we robbing?

08:48.800 --> 08:52.760
Not thieving, robbing,
Robin, Robin, like Batman and Robin.

08:52.760 --> 08:56.920
Oh, that Robin. Who's robbing? Me.
You want to give that up, son.

08:56.920 --> 09:00.120
No, Mammy, he's not going to be
robbing, he's going to BE Robin.

09:02.600 --> 09:06.160
When? In a few days. But he's not
robbing today? Obviously.

09:06.160 --> 09:10.560
But he's going to be robbing,
and you think that's OK?
Mammy, you're getting confused.

09:10.560 --> 09:13.640
Dermot, can I explain?
This should be good.

09:13.640 --> 09:20.080
You see, Mrs Brown, Robin is good,
and I'm going to be Robin,

09:20.080 --> 09:23.120
so, if I'm Robin, Robin,
then there will be no robbing,

09:23.120 --> 09:25.200
because Robin,
he's not into robbing.

09:28.360 --> 09:32.880
Like Batman and Robin? Yeah.
Seriously, you got it from that?

09:32.880 --> 09:35.320
I thought it was perfectly clear.

09:36.920 --> 09:41.680
It's a job, for a day or two, Buster.
I'll be Batman, you'll be Robin.

09:41.680 --> 09:44.920
OK. Be here at nine o'clock.
Nine o'clock.

09:46.440 --> 09:49.320
Nine o'clock in the morning? Yes.
Right, nine o'clock.

09:49.320 --> 09:52.240
Righty oh, see you later, Mrs Brown.

09:52.240 --> 09:55.040
Don't let the door hit you on
the arse on the way out, son.

09:56.200 --> 10:00.800
Well, Superson, would you like a cup
of Supertea? Love one, ma.

10:00.800 --> 10:02.240
Well, I'll get it for you.

10:09.680 --> 10:11.760
4.50, please, Rory.

10:11.760 --> 10:14.040
Mr Foley, look over my shoulder
and tell me

10:14.040 --> 10:16.200
if Dino and Barbara
are staring at me.

10:18.440 --> 10:21.160
Big-time. 4.50, please.

10:26.120 --> 10:30.240
Bridget McConinghan. What about her?

10:30.240 --> 10:36.480
The big C. No she's not. What?

10:36.480 --> 10:40.840
She's not a "see you next Tuesday."
No, she has the big C.

10:40.840 --> 10:42.640
After 12 kids, Agnes?

10:48.720 --> 10:54.800
The big C, she has cancer. Who has?
Bridget McConinghan. As well?

10:56.320 --> 10:57.880
That's unlucky.

10:59.120 --> 11:05.000
Winnie, you know sometimes it's like
talking to a feckin' revolving door.

11:05.000 --> 11:08.440
Luckily, she has the kind they can
cure. She got a big fright though.

11:08.440 --> 11:09.840
I'll bet.

11:09.840 --> 11:14.920
Do you check yourself, Agnes?
Every time I have a bath. I don't.

11:14.920 --> 11:17.280
I should, but...
What do you look for?

11:17.280 --> 11:20.760
Lumps, bumps, any irregularity at
all, get it checked by the doctor.

11:20.760 --> 11:24.280
Doesn't matter if it turns out to be
nothing, get it feckin' checked.

11:24.280 --> 11:27.920
I suppose.
I'm ready for another drink.

11:27.920 --> 11:33.560
That's funny, so am I. Fine, then.

11:39.120 --> 11:46.240
Betty. Betty, take a look at me now,
take a good look. Am I fat?

11:47.760 --> 11:50.200
Well, you could lose a few pounds.

11:51.800 --> 11:55.400
Well, you no fucking
Twiggy yourself,

11:55.400 --> 11:57.280
with your big hippo arse on you.

11:57.280 --> 12:00.640
Mammy, what Betty is trying to
say... She said I'm fat.

12:00.640 --> 12:05.960
Well, yes, Mammy, you are. Well,
not fat, but certainly overweight.

12:05.960 --> 12:08.400
Come on, gang up on fat mammy.

12:09.560 --> 12:12.480
What's up? Betty, she says I'm fat.

12:12.480 --> 12:15.040
Mrs Brown, everybody puts on
a few pounds, now and then.

12:15.040 --> 12:18.000
Sure, Cathy will tell you.

12:19.880 --> 12:23.720
Well, not everybody,
but, yeah, Betty's right.

12:23.720 --> 12:27.240
Mammy, maybe you just need to diet
a bit to get back in shape?

12:28.760 --> 12:30.680
But Mammy was always that shape.

12:30.680 --> 12:33.080
Maybe that was because
Mammy delivered

12:33.080 --> 12:34.800
a big fucking lump like you?

12:34.800 --> 12:37.280
Dermot, get lost, will you?

12:37.280 --> 12:42.000
Yes, Dermot, shag off.
Go find yourself a phone box.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.680
Since I had Bono, I've been
struggling to lose weight.

12:45.680 --> 12:47.000
Yeah, she has.

12:48.160 --> 12:52.520
Well, not that much. Well, no,
that's because you worked it.

12:52.520 --> 12:55.440
Exactly. I'm on a diet, if you
like I'll give you a copy of it?

12:55.440 --> 12:59.720
Come on, Ma, you have nothing
to lose. Except a few pounds.

12:59.720 --> 13:01.760
Feck it, I'll try the diet.

13:01.760 --> 13:04.640
I'll try it, even though
I see what it did to your skin.

13:27.400 --> 13:29.200
TELEVISION AUDIBLE

13:32.080 --> 13:36.880
Is she here? Who? Cathy.
No. Thank God.

13:36.880 --> 13:39.640
Three days on this diet,
it's feckin' killing me.

13:42.120 --> 13:47.240
Oh, Rory, oh, these are gorgeous.

13:49.000 --> 13:53.240
Hiya, Mammy. Hello, love.
I smell chips.

13:54.560 --> 13:57.880
Ah, Rory, that's very unfair,
bringing chips home,

13:57.880 --> 14:00.000
when you know Mammy's on a diet.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.880
Yes, Rory, how could you be
so inconsiderate?!

14:03.880 --> 14:07.600
You feckin' bastard, me trying to
lose a few... I'm so sorry.

14:07.600 --> 14:09.480
You know what she's feckin' like.

14:09.480 --> 14:12.040
Here, I wouldn't hurt
you for the world, love.

14:12.040 --> 14:15.960
Tea? You bastard! You dirty...

14:15.960 --> 14:18.240
Two sugars. I'm trying to diet...

14:18.240 --> 14:20.200
I'm sorry, Rory. I'm so sorry.

14:20.200 --> 14:24.480
Have some yourself.
Go on, help yourself. I'm sorry.

14:24.480 --> 14:27.400
Would you like some
cottage cheese, Mammy?

14:27.400 --> 14:30.440
No, I'm stuffed with all that
feckin' lettuce and cucumber.

14:30.440 --> 14:33.080
I'm home, Mammy. That's good, love.

14:33.080 --> 14:34.720
Well, hello there, Rory.

14:34.720 --> 14:36.640
Hiya, Dermot. Are you all right?

14:36.640 --> 14:39.360
I'm sorry, Dermot, I'm miles away.

14:39.360 --> 14:44.240
Now, son, there's a drop of tea
for you. Thanks, Ma.

14:44.240 --> 14:49.320
Rory, love, do you want a drop
of tea? No, thanks, Mammy. Fine.

14:49.320 --> 14:54.080
Dermot, I'm doing a bit of dinner
for Rory, you're welcome to join us.

14:54.080 --> 14:58.520
What is it?
Filet de poisson en croute.

14:58.520 --> 15:02.000
What's that? Fuckin' fish fingers.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.160
No, Ma, I'd better not.

15:03.160 --> 15:06.680
Maria's off at eight, we're going to
her mammy's house for dinner later.

15:06.680 --> 15:09.280
I'm just saying, if you want to
join us there's plenty.

15:09.280 --> 15:12.960
Thanks, Ma. You're welcome.
Hiya, Dermot. Hiya, Cathy.

15:12.960 --> 15:15.320
Dermot, I'm going out
to do my outside windows.

15:15.320 --> 15:17.520
If I'm not back in 15 minutes,
come and get me.

15:17.520 --> 15:18.920
You know what I'm like,

15:18.920 --> 15:21.560
I'll probably be
feckin' five houses away.

15:21.560 --> 15:23.640
OK, Ma.

15:23.640 --> 15:27.240
So, what is it? What's up?

15:27.240 --> 15:29.360
Dermot, I hate being the manager.

15:29.360 --> 15:33.840
Dino's not talking to me and all the
other stylists are ganging up on me.

15:33.840 --> 15:35.240
Can't be easy, I suppose.

15:38.560 --> 15:40.200
CRASH

15:53.640 --> 15:55.160
And now there's this!

15:55.160 --> 15:57.640
Dermot, what do you think they are?

16:02.000 --> 16:05.400
LSD! Jesus, Rory, you're not
taking acid, are you?

16:05.400 --> 16:08.160
No, I'm not. I found them in work.

16:08.160 --> 16:09.520
So who owns them?

16:09.520 --> 16:13.440
I don't know. But as the manager,
I have to find out.

16:13.440 --> 16:17.280
What's them? Who owns them? Rory.

16:17.280 --> 16:18.760
They're mine, Mammy.

16:18.760 --> 16:23.040
What are they for? Erm...
They're something I got for...

16:23.040 --> 16:25.880
heartburn. You'd better take some
before your fish fingers.

16:25.880 --> 16:29.680
No, no, no, Mammy, I haven't got
heartburn now. I'll take them later.

16:29.680 --> 16:32.880
I'll put them away safe.
No, Mammy, I'll keep them safe.

16:32.880 --> 16:34.880
Rory, you've a head
like a feckin' sieve,

16:34.880 --> 16:36.520
you'll forget where you put them.

16:36.520 --> 16:39.800
And with my grandson in and out
of the house, I want them safe.

16:39.800 --> 16:41.760
I'll put them away,
there's no problem.

16:41.760 --> 16:43.120
If you want one just ask. Ha!

16:48.000 --> 16:50.520
I am not hungry.

16:50.520 --> 16:51.800
I am not hungry.

16:51.800 --> 16:53.080
I'm not hungry!

16:53.080 --> 16:55.600
I wasn't hungry yesterday,
I'm not hungry today

16:55.600 --> 16:57.280
and I won't be hungry tomorrow.

16:57.280 --> 16:58.960
I am not feckin' hungry!

16:58.960 --> 17:01.560
Hiya, Ma. I'm fuckin' starving!

17:01.560 --> 17:04.920
Had a lovely meal at Maria's
mother's house last night.

17:04.920 --> 17:06.160
That's nice.

17:06.160 --> 17:09.120
I never had pale grape sauce before.

17:09.120 --> 17:13.640
She drizzled it over two pork chops
and served it with creamed spinach!

17:16.520 --> 17:19.160
Mammy, are you licking my hand?

17:22.000 --> 17:23.800
Sorry.

17:23.800 --> 17:26.440
KNOCK AT DOOR
Here's Robin.

17:26.440 --> 17:27.640
It's open, Buster.

17:31.800 --> 17:34.480
What the hell?! Right then!

17:34.480 --> 17:37.000
Let's go riding through the glen.

17:37.000 --> 17:40.560
What do you think, Mrs Brown?
Do I look like the real Robin?

17:40.560 --> 17:43.240
No, you look like a real thrush.
A thrush, why?

17:43.240 --> 17:45.720
You look like an irritating c...
Mammy!

17:47.560 --> 17:50.160
Got to go, Mammy.
Will I see you for dinner?

17:50.160 --> 17:53.040
No, Ma, I'm meeting Maria later
and taking her for a Chinese.

17:53.040 --> 17:54.680
Feckin' Chinese!

17:56.080 --> 17:57.800
And you, you gobshite, Buster,

17:57.800 --> 17:59.920
come on, I'll get you
a proper costume.

17:59.920 --> 18:02.200
Right, let's go, kemo sabe!

18:03.600 --> 18:05.520
Still wrong!

18:07.240 --> 18:09.280
AGNES CRIES

18:09.280 --> 18:12.920
Are you all right, Agnes?
No, Winnie, I think I'm anorexic!

18:14.760 --> 18:19.000
What? Ten days, TEN DAYS,
I've been on this diet!

18:19.000 --> 18:22.960
And have you lost anything?
Yes, ten feckin' days!

18:22.960 --> 18:27.000
How do you feel, pet? I'm starving.
Well, did you weigh yourself today?

18:27.000 --> 18:30.400
The scales is broken. Agnes,
everyone on a diet thinks that.

18:30.400 --> 18:33.920
No, really, I threw them out
the bathroom window yesterday.

18:33.920 --> 18:37.080
Morning, Mammy. Hello, love.
I'll get you a cup of tea.

18:37.080 --> 18:41.600
No, I'll get it meself. No, I was
going to lick out the oven anyway.

18:41.600 --> 18:45.000
Cathy, I can't do this diet.
Yes, you can.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.480
I can't, I'm after eating a whole
packet of them Ryvita crackers.

18:48.480 --> 18:49.960
And then I ate the wrapper!

18:51.320 --> 18:55.920
And the wrapper was
the feckin' nicest part. Now, now.

18:55.920 --> 18:58.760
And you seen that stuff,
I Can't Believe It's Not Butter?

18:58.760 --> 19:01.560
Yeah. It's not fuckin' butter!

19:03.240 --> 19:07.040
Ah, now, Mammy,
you're doing fantastic.

19:07.040 --> 19:10.680
I'm doing steamed cod's roll
for dinner tonight.

19:10.680 --> 19:15.200
Oh, I won't be here. I meant to
tell you, I'm going for dinner
with Thomas. Professor Clowne.

19:15.200 --> 19:18.120
That's longer than
we all expected it to last, Cathy.

19:18.120 --> 19:19.520
It's just a date, Mammy.

19:19.520 --> 19:22.440
Actually, I think he's only
dating me to get to you.

19:22.440 --> 19:24.040
Likes fat women, does he?

19:28.960 --> 19:30.320
I'm sorry, Winnie?

19:30.320 --> 19:32.720
Nothing... Nothing.

19:32.720 --> 19:36.160
He's determined to interview you
for his book.

19:36.160 --> 19:38.800
Well, he can be all
the determined he likes,

19:38.800 --> 19:42.240
he's not interviewing me
unless he pays me - in chocolate.

19:43.600 --> 19:46.040
Mammy, you're making
too big a thing of this diet

19:46.040 --> 19:48.240
and you haven't got
that much longer to go.

19:48.240 --> 19:49.440
Really, how long?

19:49.440 --> 19:52.880
Six weeks. And I'll be watching you
every step of the way.

19:52.880 --> 19:55.440
Six feckin' weeks!

19:55.440 --> 19:57.720
Cathy, in six weeks
I'll have eaten Winnie!

19:57.720 --> 19:59.920
I have to go.

19:59.920 --> 20:02.400
I'll see you later, Agnes.

20:02.400 --> 20:04.480
In about seven weeks.

20:06.200 --> 20:08.560
Bring food!

20:13.200 --> 20:16.360
If that's you, Winnie,
I'm in the sitting room.

20:16.360 --> 20:20.680
Is it safe to come in
or will you lick me to death?

20:20.680 --> 20:22.480
So, how's the diet going? It's gone.

20:22.480 --> 20:26.240
I had four doughnuts
before you walked in the door.

20:26.240 --> 20:30.800
Well, that could kill you, Agnes.
I don't give a shite,
I won't be carrying the coffin.

20:34.880 --> 20:36.880
So Cathy is dating your man Clowne?

20:36.880 --> 20:41.600
So it seems.
Well, dating, but not... Not...

20:41.600 --> 20:45.240
Are you all right, love? Just cramp.
That could be them doughnuts, Agnes.

20:45.240 --> 20:47.480
Thanks for the sympathy,
I feel much better.

20:47.480 --> 20:49.480
Really?! No.

20:49.480 --> 20:51.440
Go on.

20:51.440 --> 20:56.080
He's not what you call a boyfriend,
he's more... Oh, Jesus.

20:56.080 --> 21:00.440
Oh, Agnes. You've got nothing
for indigestion, have you?
No, but I can go back to the house.

21:00.440 --> 21:04.800
I can go back to the house
and check for you, love.
No, you're all right, I'll be fine.

21:04.800 --> 21:07.680
She said that... Wait a minute.

21:07.680 --> 21:10.480
Rory had stuff for heartburn.
Oh, great.

21:10.480 --> 21:12.640
What did I feckin' do with it?

21:15.680 --> 21:17.560
Ha-ha-ha! I have it!

21:19.120 --> 21:20.920
These are very small.

21:20.920 --> 21:23.160
Well, take two, Agnes.

21:25.920 --> 21:28.440
Oh, Jesus, they taste like shit.

21:28.440 --> 21:32.480
Oh, God, I think
I'd rather have indigestion.

21:32.480 --> 21:34.520
You'll be better in a flash.
Now, go on.

21:34.520 --> 21:37.440
Well, she was saying that
he's not really....

21:37.440 --> 21:40.920
She's dating him,
but there's nothing serious, so...

21:40.920 --> 21:42.600
Hmm-hmm!

21:49.600 --> 21:51.600
She's not... She...

21:51.600 --> 21:53.280
Whoo!

21:55.240 --> 21:57.320
She's...

21:59.080 --> 22:00.680
Ha-ha-ha!

22:04.840 --> 22:07.920
Who owns that feckin' horse?!

22:07.920 --> 22:09.560
Hello, horsey!

22:14.320 --> 22:16.080
Nice horsey!

22:16.080 --> 22:19.880
Hello, horsey!
SHE CACKLES

22:27.560 --> 22:28.720
Where was I?

22:28.720 --> 22:30.840
Well, he's not
what you call a boyfriend.

22:30.840 --> 22:32.920
What do you call a boyfriend?

22:32.920 --> 22:35.520
John, I suppose, is that his name?

22:35.520 --> 22:37.960
You can him John-John-John...

22:48.600 --> 22:50.200
Don't look, don't look at him!

22:52.880 --> 22:54.480
Fuckin' Spider-Man!

22:54.480 --> 22:55.960
Jesus.

23:04.280 --> 23:06.240
Winnie, where are you?!

23:06.240 --> 23:07.560
I'm here!

23:07.560 --> 23:09.600
Don't fuckin' sneak up on me!

23:11.640 --> 23:13.040
He's... He...

23:13.040 --> 23:17.080
He has his site
on the World Wide Web...

23:17.080 --> 23:18.440
The web?!

23:18.440 --> 23:21.840
On the web. The web! Feckin' web.

23:21.840 --> 23:26.320
Where is it? Winnie, do you know
what I saw on the internet? What?

23:26.320 --> 23:28.680
Do you know what I saw on the...

23:39.160 --> 23:42.640
Do you know what I saw
on the internet? No.

23:42.640 --> 23:44.120
On the internet they said

23:44.120 --> 23:47.480
that if you get everybody in the
whole world who works in McDonalds

23:47.480 --> 23:48.920
to hold hands,

23:48.920 --> 23:51.040
you have to get your own burger.

23:52.680 --> 23:54.360
Burgers?!

23:54.360 --> 23:56.480
Do you want chips with that, dear?

23:56.480 --> 23:58.600
Agnes, what's wrong with you, love?

24:03.400 --> 24:06.920
Agnes? Will you stop
feckin' sneaking up on me!

24:08.040 --> 24:09.360
I'm feckin' starving.

24:09.360 --> 24:10.920
Let me get you something to eat.

24:10.920 --> 24:14.040
No, it's all right, Winnie, I'll
take a bite of the chair. Agnes!

24:14.040 --> 24:15.800
Come on. You're going to bed, love.

24:15.800 --> 24:18.640
Come on, you're not well. Come on.

24:18.640 --> 24:20.760
No, we can't go upstairs. Why?

24:20.760 --> 24:23.160
We can't go past the fuckin' horse!
Oh, Agnes, come here.

24:23.160 --> 24:26.920
Come on, up you go.
Up you go. That's it.

24:29.120 --> 24:30.440
Winnie! What?

24:30.440 --> 24:32.600
I fucking love you. Oh, feck off!

24:39.440 --> 24:42.320
Oh, we've the place to ourselves.
Sit down.

24:42.320 --> 24:44.320
I'd love to see those notes.

24:44.320 --> 24:48.040
I was hoping your mother would be
here. Yeah, what a shame(!) Cathy.

24:48.040 --> 24:51.480
Winnie. It's your mammy, love,
she's not well.

24:51.480 --> 24:55.520
Now, I put her to bed, but you need
to check on her later, love, OK?

24:55.520 --> 24:57.640
Thanks, Winnie, I'll walk you out.

25:16.160 --> 25:19.360
Well, there you go then,
we won't be seeing Mammy tonight.

25:19.360 --> 25:22.440
Has she mentioned if
she'll let me study her at all?

25:22.440 --> 25:24.120
No. Oh, well.

25:38.080 --> 25:40.120
Professor...

25:40.120 --> 25:43.600
Cathy, you can drop the "Professor",
unless, of course, we're in college.

25:50.320 --> 25:55.200
Thomas, Mammy's not as fascinating
as you think she is.

25:55.200 --> 25:57.520
At the end of the day,

25:57.520 --> 26:00.480
she's really just
an ordinary mother.

26:17.520 --> 26:22.280
To fight injustice,
wherever it may be!

26:22.280 --> 26:24.520
Look out, Crime, here I come!

26:59.760 --> 27:02.440
Morning, Super Mammy!

27:05.520 --> 27:07.960
Shut up, Rory.

27:07.960 --> 27:10.240
I feel like you're walking
on my eyeballs.

27:10.240 --> 27:12.400
HE LAUGHS

27:14.240 --> 27:15.800
You sound happy.

27:15.800 --> 27:17.480
I am. I spoke to the boss

27:17.480 --> 27:21.360
and he's going to have
me and Dino as joint managers.

27:21.360 --> 27:22.760
That's nice.

27:22.760 --> 27:25.920
Well, I hope you're proud of
yourself. Stop, Cathy, please.

27:25.920 --> 27:27.480
I'm sorry, OK?

27:27.480 --> 27:30.160
I suppose he never
wants to see you again.

27:30.160 --> 27:34.840
On the contrary, he was delighted
with your "performance".

27:34.840 --> 27:38.000
I am seeing him again, and you ARE
going to help with his book.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.400
No, I don't want... Mammy!

27:40.400 --> 27:41.960
Fine.

27:41.960 --> 27:44.120
Tea, Cathy?

27:44.120 --> 27:45.520
Oh, thanks, Rory.

27:45.520 --> 27:47.800
Oh, no, we're short of milk.

27:47.800 --> 27:51.920
Mammy, would you fly down
to the shops and get some?

27:51.920 --> 27:54.360
CATHY HOWLS WITH LAUGHTER

28:02.760 --> 28:05.120
Well, that's the story this week.

28:05.120 --> 28:08.240
You know, families can be...

28:08.240 --> 28:10.360
They can be, you know...

28:10.360 --> 28:12.040
Good night.

28:14.080 --> 28:15.240
# Say hello

28:15.240 --> 28:20.200
# To the Queen of Dublin town

28:20.200 --> 28:22.240
# As the best mum of all
