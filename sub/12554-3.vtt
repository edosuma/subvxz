the fall of the French

01:26.820 --> 01:28.455

Well,
Mrs Pittman always says that

01:30.023 --> 01:31.791

about the present.

01:31.858 --> 01:33.693

There's lots I don't know yet.

That's a very
healthy attitude.

they start
coming out of the sky.

<i>a meteorological explanation.</i>

03:52.832 --> 03:54.834
What, you mean it's natural?

03:54.901 --> 03:57.804
Storms and tornadoes suck fish
out of the water into
the upper atmosphere.

03:57.870 --> 04:00.673
They freeze, then later,
they come raining down.

04:00.740 --> 04:03.309
Yeah, but those fish are
small. Wouldn't satisfy
next door's cat.

04:03.376 --> 04:05.812
Mr Smith, the fish today,
they were this big.

04:09.215 --> 04:11.851
No? Well, still not natural.

Oh, my dad wants to see that.

Said they found it in a cave,
like it had been hidden.

04:41.848 --> 04:43.449
I still don't
get the connection.

04:43.516 --> 04:45.585
<i>The totem pole was discovered</i>
<i>in the Mojave Desert.</i>

04:45.652 --> 04:47.553
<i>A legend</i>
<i>surrounding its discovery</i>

04:47.620 --> 04:50.089
<i>suggests that when</i>
<i>it was first removed</i>
<i>from the cave,</i>

04:50.156 --> 04:52.558
<i>a storm came out of nowhere</i>
<i>and it rained fish.</i>

04:57.797 --> 05:00.266

05:00.333 --> 05:01.834
Dead things, mostly.

05:01.901 --> 05:04.570
And people like to
look at dead things?

05:04.637 --> 05:07.640
-Isn't that a bit weird?
-Well, if you ask me, yeah.

05:07.707 --> 05:11.711
Museums help preserve our
past, Sky. They're fascinating
places. You'll see.

05:11.778 --> 05:14.714
-Mum and Dad met in a museum.
-Oh, how romantic.

05:14.781 --> 05:17.316
Though I never saw your mum
as the museum type.

05:17.383 --> 05:19.352
-It was raining.
-Ah.

05:19.419 --> 05:23.289
You got any spare change?
Just enough for a sandwich?
Please?

05:23.356 --> 05:25.858
Yeah, sure, here.

butty or something.

Cheers.

05:28.327 --> 05:29.896
Why did she want money?

05:30.697 --> 05:32.398
'Cause she's a scrounger.

05:32.465 --> 05:34.701
Why did you give her some?

05:34.767 --> 05:36.636
Because it's
probably not her fault.

05:45.611 --> 05:48.848
Isn't it pretty?

05:48.915 --> 05:51.551
I think the word
you're looking for
is "creepy".

05:54.787 --> 05:58.091
Look at those faces.

05:58.157 --> 06:01.427
There really
shouldn't be anything
sinister about a totem pole.

06:01.494 --> 06:04.731

a kind of storybook
carved from cedar trees

I run the Anthropology
Department here.

06:35.294 --> 06:36.996
I suppose you've
made the connection

06:37.063 --> 06:40.266
between the totem pole and
fish raining from
the skies today, then?

06:40.333 --> 06:42.435
So it was the totem
pole that caused it.

06:42.502 --> 06:44.103
(CHUCKLING) No, of course not.

06:44.170 --> 06:45.872
She's not really with us.

06:45.938 --> 06:47.840
My daughter has
quite a sense of humour.

06:47.907 --> 06:49.642
Do I?

06:49.709 --> 06:52.545
Have to say, I couldn't wish
for a better publicity stunt.

06:52.612 --> 06:54.881
Maybe Hetocumtek
is on our side.

06:54.947 --> 06:56.682
SARAH JANE: I'm sorry?
Why Hetocumtek?

06:56.749 --> 06:58.551
According to legend,

06:58.618 --> 07:02.221
Hetocumtek was
a vicious warrior god
who descended from the skies

07:02.288 --> 07:04.757
and tried to enslave
the people of
the Great Plains.

07:04.824 --> 07:08.628
But the story goes
that the tribes'
greatest medicine men

07:08.694 --> 07:12.932
came together and tricked
Hetocumtek, imprisoning him
in a totem pole.

07:13.132 --> 07:15.234
What, this totem pole?

07:15.301 --> 07:19.872
Well, it is only a story.
Now, if you'll excuse me.

07:22.475 --> 07:24.410
So, what do you think,
Sarah Jane?

07:24.477 --> 07:27.914
Hetocumtek, what,
some warrior god
or some nasty alien?

07:27.980 --> 07:31.150
Aliens masquerading as gods?
It wouldn't be the first time.

07:31.217 --> 07:34.187
I don't really believe
in the magical
powers of medicine men.

07:34.253 --> 07:38.224
(SCANNER BUZZING)

07:38.291 --> 07:41.260
And according to my scans,
there's no alien energy here.

07:41.327 --> 07:44.330
So if anything alien did cause
today's shower of fish,

07:44.397 --> 07:47.366
it wasn't this totem
pole or Hetocumtek.

07:47.433 --> 07:49.068
Oh, gotcha!

07:51.170 --> 07:52.872
Come on.

08:05.351 --> 08:08.588
Hello, love.
Was that Sarah Jane
giving you a lift?

08:08.654 --> 08:11.958
Yeah, me and Rani were helping
her mum at the shop and
Sarah Jane dropped by.

08:12.024 --> 08:14.327
Oh, that's nice.
Did you see the fish?

08:14.393 --> 08:16.796
Yeah. That's school dinner
sorted for next week.

08:16.863 --> 08:18.564
Could've come
battered with chips,
though.

08:18.631 --> 08:21.400
Mmm. They're saying
it's some kind of
freak weather thing.

08:21.467 --> 08:25.504
Anyway, I hate fish. When it's
raining chocolate,
let me know.

08:27.907 --> 08:29.542
I'll go and set the table.

08:29.609 --> 08:34.113
Oh! Who needs chocolate
when I've got
my little Clydey?

find anything to
suggest an alien energy.

10:19.752 --> 10:22.188
So, maybe for once
we can stand down.

who never stands down?

10:29.929 --> 10:32.565
-Did you do this?
-Of course. What do you think?

10:32.631 --> 10:35.001
It's good. It's really good.

10:35.067 --> 10:38.371
Is this what you want to do?
I mean, after school?

10:38.437 --> 10:41.040
Yeah, well, drawing's about
the only thing I'm
any good at, so...

10:41.107 --> 10:43.242
Oh, don't do yourself down.
You're bright.

10:43.309 --> 10:46.345
But there's no doubt,

so I thought, why not?

10:48.814 --> 10:51.784
Look out, Stan Lee,

10:53.519 --> 10:55.888
I mean, a rocket scientist

10:55.955 --> 10:57.823

Well, he is, isn't he?
He's a genius.

11:01.594 --> 11:04.196
Yeah, but the way you say it,
it's a bad thing,

11:04.263 --> 11:06.532
as if there's
something wrong with him.

11:06.599 --> 11:09.468
No. Sorry,
I didn't mean it like that.

11:11.103 --> 11:13.239
-Are you all right?
-No.

11:13.305 --> 11:14.874

of the way you're always
making fun of my son.

11:17.410 --> 11:19.478
Sarah Jane, what's going on?

11:19.545 --> 11:21.247

all you've ever done is tell
him how uncool he was,

11:21.313 --> 11:23.849
what a geek he was,
what a freak he was.

11:23.916 --> 11:26.886
And all the while, you're
wasting your time with
rubbish like this!

She's just gone
completely mental.

What are you talking about?

12:09.495 --> 12:10.729
Ah, Clyde Langer!

12:13.933 --> 12:16.702
-You get away from me!
-What?

12:16.769 --> 12:18.370
Leave my daughter alone!

12:18.437 --> 12:20.940
What's going on?
What did I do?
I didn't do anything!

12:21.006 --> 12:22.708

you keep him away from me!

12:22.775 --> 12:24.410
Rani, we're mates.

12:24.477 --> 12:25.945
Keep away from her.
You're no friend
of my daughter.

But this is mad.
We're friends, Rani!

12:28.180 --> 12:31.851

any friend of yours.
I hate you!

12:33.853 --> 12:35.754
Rani...

12:35.821 --> 12:37.356
I'll give you 10 seconds.

12:37.423 --> 12:39.758
I don't want you anywhere
near my daughter.
Is that understood?

12:39.825 --> 12:42.828
And as far as school goes,
you're excluded.

12:43.696 --> 12:46.198
You can't do that.

12:46.265 --> 12:50.469
Something's got at you.
Both of you. And Sarah Jane.

12:50.536 --> 12:52.705
I don't know what it is,
but none of it's real.

12:52.771 --> 12:55.741
Can you just think about it?
Please.
I haven't done anything!

12:55.808 --> 12:57.743
You're out of time!

12:57.810 --> 12:59.712
You come
anywhere near me again
and I'm calling the police.

12:59.778 --> 13:02.381
All right, I'm gone.
But there's
something going on here,

13:02.448 --> 13:04.116
and I'm going to fix it.

13:04.183 --> 13:06.385
You do what you like,
but I don't want
to see you again!

13:06.452 --> 13:07.987
Not ever!

13:22.368 --> 13:24.803
MR SMITH: <i>Sarah Jane,</i>
<i>are you all right?</i>

13:24.870 --> 13:27.006
Yes, Mr Smith. I'm fine!

13:27.072 --> 13:31.043
<i>I am detecting an</i>
<i>exceptionally high oscillation</i>
<i>of beta brainwaves,</i>

13:31.110 --> 13:33.078
<i>suggesting intense anger.</i>

13:33.145 --> 13:35.114
No, Mr Smith.
I don't think so.

13:35.181 --> 13:39.885
<i>Oh, how curious. Your beta</i>
<i>brainwave</i>
<i>activity is now normal.</i>

13:39.952 --> 13:41.754
Sarah Jane, how do I look?

13:41.820 --> 13:44.423
Oh, you look marvellous!

13:44.490 --> 13:46.859
-I'm so proud of you.
-Why?

13:46.926 --> 13:48.427
Because I put
the school uniform on right?

13:48.494 --> 13:51.830
No, no.
Because you're on
your way to school

13:51.897 --> 13:54.166
and you've barely
been on Earth a month.

13:54.233 --> 13:58.470
And I know this must all seem
so strange to you,
but you're very brave, Sky.

13:58.537 --> 14:01.840
Why do I have to be brave at
school? Will people try
and hurt me there?

14:01.907 --> 14:04.877
No. No.
No one's going to
try to hurt you.

14:04.944 --> 14:07.079
But,
well, it will seem strange,

14:07.146 --> 14:10.115
you're going to be mixing
with lots of new people.

14:10.182 --> 14:12.384
I know,
it's going to be so exciting.

14:12.451 --> 14:14.887
(CHUCKLING) You see,
that's what I mean.

14:14.954 --> 14:17.556
Oh,
you're going to be brilliant.

14:17.623 --> 14:19.725
Will you be lonely
without me today?

14:19.792 --> 14:23.662
Well, actually, I was thinking
I might pay another
visit to the museum.

14:23.729 --> 14:25.731
I thought you said
the totem pole wasn't alien?

14:25.798 --> 14:28.400
No, no, it isn't.
But this is
a professional interest.

14:28.467 --> 14:30.636
Mr Smith,
has anyone run a story

14:30.703 --> 14:34.940
on the mythological connection
between the shower of fish
and the totem pole?

14:35.007 --> 14:37.509
<i>It appears not, Sarah Jane.</i>

14:37.576 --> 14:38.877
Perfect.

14:38.944 --> 14:40.579
So, while I'm off
getting my scoop,

14:40.646 --> 14:42.748
you'll be making
lots of new friends at school.

14:42.815 --> 14:45.517
And don't worry,
Rani will always be
close by if you need her.

14:45.584 --> 14:47.353
And Clyde.

14:47.419 --> 14:49.421
You keep away from him!

14:49.922 --> 14:51.290
Why?

14:51.357 --> 14:53.192
Just do as I say.
Keep away from him!

14:53.259 --> 14:55.327
Don't go anywhere near him.
Do you hear me?

14:55.394 --> 14:56.729
Yes, Sarah Jane.

14:56.795 --> 14:59.565
I don't ever want
to hear his name again!

14:59.632 --> 15:01.867
MR SMITH: <i>Excuse me,</i>
<i>but has Clyde upset you?</i>

15:01.934 --> 15:04.670
And that goes for you, too!

15:04.737 --> 15:08.807
In fact, I want you
to put your sensors
on a permanent scan for him.

15:08.874 --> 15:12.645
If he ever sets foot
in Bannerman Road again,

15:12.711 --> 15:15.481
-I want you to deal with him.
<i>-Understood, Sarah Jane.</i>

15:15.547 --> 15:17.850
Sky, come on! School.

15:28.494 --> 15:31.430
Luke? It's Clyde.

15:31.497 --> 15:34.867
Look, I'm getting really
freaked out here.
Something's...

15:36.335 --> 15:40.005
Luke... No, no, listen to me!

15:40.072 --> 15:44.476
I'm your friend!
There's something...
It's got to you, too.

15:47.012 --> 15:48.580
Luke?

15:50.049 --> 15:53.852
(SIGHS) This is not happening.
This is not happening.

15:56.822 --> 15:58.457
Had enough of
sixth form, then?

15:59.792 --> 16:01.327
You all right, Steve?

16:01.393 --> 16:04.363
So what, too busy to come
play football with your mates?

16:04.430 --> 16:08.000
Yeah. Sort of. I'm sorry.

16:08.067 --> 16:09.401
How's your job-hunting going?

16:09.468 --> 16:11.303
Yeah, great.

16:11.370 --> 16:14.006
Got a Chelsea scout coming
down this afternoon
to watch me play.

16:14.073 --> 16:16.342
It's going to be good.
Quarter of a million a week,

16:16.408 --> 16:19.111
choice of my own WAG,
Girls Aloud,
Saturdays, you name it.

16:19.178 --> 16:21.847
-It's brilliant, innit?
-I'm sorry, mate.

16:23.782 --> 16:26.485
Fancy a kickabout?

16:26.552 --> 16:30.723
Stuff to do.
But listen, Steve.
It was nice to see you, man.

16:30.789 --> 16:34.526
No worries. Look, I tell you
what, I'll put in
a good word for you.

16:34.593 --> 16:36.562
I'll say, "Listen, Cheryl,

16:36.628 --> 16:38.430
"I got a friend, mate of mine,

16:38.497 --> 16:40.065
"Clyde Langer.

16:45.637 --> 16:48.240
-"He used to be all right."
-CLYDE: Steve?

16:48.307 --> 16:49.908
"Now he's in sixth form.

16:49.975 --> 16:51.210
"Thinks he's better
than the rest of
all of his mates."

16:51.276 --> 16:53.746
No,
no, you've got it all wrong.

16:53.812 --> 16:56.715
You said my name!
They all said my name!

16:56.782 --> 16:59.651
Steve!
Look, listen to me, okay.
This is going to sound crazy,

16:59.718 --> 17:02.388
but I think there's something
wrong with my name.
It's like it's cursed.

17:02.454 --> 17:03.756
(SCOFFS) We'll fix that!

17:03.822 --> 17:05.424
No, look, Steve.
You don't want
to do this, okay?

17:05.491 --> 17:07.425
This isn't you.
Just listen to me...

17:09.261 --> 17:12.131
And that's what I'm
going to do to you.

17:12.196 --> 17:13.898
-Get him! Stop him!
-BOY: He's getting away. Hey!

17:31.583 --> 17:32.851
BOY: Where did he go?

17:32.918 --> 17:35.487
STEVE: Got to go somewhere.
Look, come on!

18:14.460 --> 18:16.428
Now what?

18:18.497 --> 18:21.700
Oh, excuse me. Hi, Dr Madigan.

18:21.767 --> 18:24.203
Hello.
Weren't you here yesterday?

18:24.269 --> 18:26.038
Yeah.

18:26.104 --> 18:31.143
Look, you're an expert on
totem poles and Native
American stuff, right?

18:31.210 --> 18:33.979
And stuff. Lots of stuff, yes.

18:34.046 --> 18:36.582
Do you know
anything about curses?

18:36.648 --> 18:39.685
Native American curses?

18:39.751 --> 18:41.753
The most famous
is the Curse of Tippecanoe.

18:41.820 --> 18:46.024
It was, or is, a curse on
the presidents of
the United States.

18:46.091 --> 18:49.628
What about a curse that makes
all your friends turn on you?

18:50.629 --> 18:51.864
I'm sorry?

18:55.767 --> 18:57.236
I'm going to have to go.

18:57.302 --> 18:59.104
I'd advise you
to keep your
distance from him!

18:59.171 --> 19:00.873
Sarah Jane,
please, listen to me.

19:00.939 --> 19:02.441
This is some sort of curse.

19:02.508 --> 19:04.243
You're serious?
You think you've been cursed?

19:04.309 --> 19:06.612
SARAH JANE:
Don't waste your time.
He's a troublemaker.

19:06.678 --> 19:08.380
He's clearly distressed.

19:08.447 --> 19:11.350
All day,
every one of my friends
has been turning against me.

19:11.416 --> 19:12.851
I think it's got something
to do with my name.

19:12.918 --> 19:14.620
Oh, don't waste your time.

19:14.686 --> 19:16.922
Your name?
It's Clyde, isn't it?

19:16.989 --> 19:18.624
-No, don't!
-Clyde Langer.

19:23.629 --> 19:25.731
It's not just
the people that know me.
It's everyone.

19:25.797 --> 19:28.700
I think you'd better leave,
or do I have to call security?

19:28.767 --> 19:30.435
What did I tell you?

19:30.502 --> 19:31.870
-Is there
a problem here, Doctor?
-Get him out of here.

19:31.937 --> 19:34.907
-Let's have you out.
-No! It's the totem pole!
I know it is!

19:34.973 --> 19:37.276
All right, that's enough!
Get him, lads!

19:37.342 --> 19:41.446
Sarah Jane!
Please remember me!
I'm your friend!

19:41.513 --> 19:44.850

I want to make a complaint.
I'm being harassed.

CLYDE: Mum?

20:14.947 --> 20:16.848
Mum?

20:25.857 --> 20:27.593
Mum...

20:27.659 --> 20:29.661
Where have you been?

20:30.796 --> 20:33.265
Just out. Why?

20:33.332 --> 20:36.234
You're always lying about
where you've been,
what you've been doing.

20:36.301 --> 20:38.937
-No, Mum...
-More lies. Always lies.

20:39.137 --> 20:41.506
Mum, whatever you're thinking,
it's not real, okay?
It's my name.

20:41.573 --> 20:44.843
You've seen my name on a
letter and somehow it's
messing with your head.

20:44.910 --> 20:47.245
Don't touch me.
How can I ever trust you?

20:47.312 --> 20:49.381
Always skulking around,
keeping secrets.

20:49.448 --> 20:51.283
But this isn't real.
I haven't done anything.

20:51.350 --> 20:52.784
I don't want you here.

20:52.851 --> 20:55.387
I don't want to look at you,
I don't want to hear you.

20:55.454 --> 20:58.624
I feel like I've had my soul
torn out of me.

20:58.690 --> 21:01.560
I didn't do this.
It's not my fault.

21:01.627 --> 21:03.862
Tell me what it is I've done!
Tell me what I've lied...

21:05.731 --> 21:07.799
You can't, can you?

21:07.866 --> 21:10.569
You can't,
because it's all a trick.
You've all been tricked.

21:10.636 --> 21:13.005
You, Sarah Jane, Rani.
Everybody.

21:13.071 --> 21:17.709
Yeah, I was tricked,
all right. Life tricked me
the day you were born.

21:17.776 --> 21:19.845
I've had enough now
and I want you out of here.

21:19.911 --> 21:21.346
-Out of my life!
-(SIREN WAILING)

21:21.413 --> 21:24.082

You don't mean that.

Please, don't do this.

21:27.853 --> 21:30.689
-Police, open up!
-Don't answer it.

21:30.756 --> 21:32.724
And you wonder
why I want you out of my life?

21:32.791 --> 21:37.162
I haven't done anything.
It's the curse!
It's taking everything over!

21:37.229 --> 21:38.864

I don't understand.
What did he do to
upset you so much?

Listen to me, Sky, and
remember, I don't want to
hear his name again.

According to our

24:27.332 --> 24:28.967
lightning burst out
of the totem pole.

SARAH JANE:
Well, that's impossible.

24:31.136 --> 24:33.238
Dr Madigan, I think it might
be best if you close
the exhibition for a while.

24:33.305 --> 24:35.207
He was your friend
and Sarah Jane's.

24:35.273 --> 24:37.342
But no one can
give me a reason
why you all turned on Clyde.

Something about that totem
pole. It's alive, Mr Smith.
I saw it.

Everything you ever were,
everything you
ever wanted to be,

24:43.215 --> 24:45.250

till there's nothing left.

24:45.317 --> 24:48.153
