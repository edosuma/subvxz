Ha! Victory.

Not quite.

00:29.929 --> 00:31.928

00:31.929 --> 00:35.928
These devices of yours are

bludgeon, grapple.

00:42.810 --> 00:45.849
It is over now, N'Basa.

00:49.100 --> 00:51.769
I think you will
let me go my way

00:51.770 --> 00:55.338

your precious train and everyone on it.

00:55.339 --> 00:57.099

00:57.100 --> 00:59.928
Wait. We must not
endanger the passengers.

00:59.929 --> 01:02.099
Very good, Black Panther.

01:02.100 --> 01:06.599

01:43.129 --> 01:47.567
So, your recent intel confirms Baron Zemo
is mixed up with this new Shadow Council?

01:47.568 --> 01:49.878
Correct, Captain.
The names in White Wolf's files

01:50.679 --> 01:53.769
allowed us to capture all the
council's operatives in Wakanda.

01:53.770 --> 01:56.538
Zemo's name was mentioned
several times.

01:56.539 --> 01:58.709
It is not much of a lead.

01:58.710 --> 02:00.999
Well, it does track.
Zemo's father was the leader

02:01.000 --> 02:03.749
of the Shadow Council
in the 1940s.

02:03.750 --> 02:06.999
You and my grandfather had history
with the elder Zemo, yes?

02:07.000 --> 02:11.749
T'Chanda and I stopped him from getting his
hands on a dangerous Wakandan artifact.

02:11.750 --> 02:14.878
Tiger Shark, N'Jadaka.
Now Zemo.

02:14.879 --> 02:16.878
A Shadow Council indeed.

02:16.879 --> 02:19.749
We still know almost nothing
of them or their plans.

02:19.750 --> 02:23.669
Zemo's slippery, for sure, but
he's also a creature of habit.

02:23.670 --> 02:27.709
If he's involved, he'll have a base
of operations, and it'll be big.

02:27.710 --> 02:29.919
There are only so many
places a roach may hide

02:39.579 --> 02:42.578
[BEEPING]

02:42.579 --> 02:44.999
The North American bases were
knocked out by the Avengers.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.999
S.H.I.E.L.D. took out
Africa and Asia.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.879
The Allies knocked out all the
European bases in World War II.

02:54.670 --> 02:56.669

Nothing.

02:56.670 --> 02:58.999

are back to square one.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.520
Not good.

03:00.521 --> 03:02.038
Perhaps there is another way.

03:02.039 --> 03:05.668
Computer, search for all known
residences of the family Zemo.

03:05.669 --> 03:07.918
Nah. Another miss.

03:07.919 --> 03:09.918
Wait. What's that?

03:09.919 --> 03:13.830
Computer, enlarge and enhance

03:16.829 --> 03:19.578
[CAPTAIN AMERICA]
Château Le Fay. Of course.

03:19.579 --> 03:22.878
It's where we defeated the
Shadow Council the first time.

03:22.879 --> 03:25.038
Care to meet me
in Switzerland, Captain?

03:25.039 --> 03:27.999
I can't, T'Challa.
The Avengers charter bans us

03:28.000 --> 03:30.919
from entering Switzerland
without official UN sanction.

03:30.920 --> 03:34.669
You would trigger an international
incident. I understand.

03:34.670 --> 03:36.878
But those rules
no longer apply to me.

03:36.879 --> 03:40.669
I will breach Château Le Fay. We
can compare notes when I return.

03:40.670 --> 03:43.669
I'll see what I can dig up on
the Shadow Council from my end.

03:43.670 --> 03:45.829
Over and out.
Good luck, T'Challa.

03:47.670 --> 03:50.579
Luck is not a factor.

03:53.710 --> 03:56.538
[SHURI] You really should bring
me on all your missions.

03:56.539 --> 03:59.828
You always overlook
the little things.

03:59.829 --> 04:03.855
It seals along the sides.
See? Perfect fit.

04:03.856 --> 04:05.709
The suit fits fine, Shuri.

04:05.710 --> 04:08.749
It's your need to constantly make
modifications that I question.

04:08.750 --> 04:11.749
You're breaking into a castle
in the Alps.

04:11.750 --> 04:15.000
That means snow, and that means...
you need to blend in.

04:17.040 --> 04:20.708
[SHURI] See? Perfect camouflage.
They'll never see you coming.

04:20.709 --> 04:22.828
Ah. It is a nice touch,
sister.

04:22.829 --> 04:25.669
And it will be effective
in aiding me in my mission.

04:25.670 --> 04:26.828

04:26.829 --> 04:29.870
I'm not your tailor,

04:29.871 --> 04:31.669
And you have.

04:31.670 --> 04:33.749
You are.
While I breach the castle,

04:33.750 --> 04:36.669
I will need eyes in the air...
your eyes.

04:36.670 --> 04:38.828
This is just like
when you made me stand lookout

04:38.829 --> 04:40.999
while you and Hunter
snuck into Father's archives.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.039
I'm not a child, T'Challa.

04:43.040 --> 04:46.999
Who is Wakanda's best pilot?

04:47.000 --> 04:48.669
I am.

04:48.670 --> 04:50.578
And is this, or is it not,

That's the airship
not giving up.

12:22.869 --> 12:25.636
I'm losing patience. Could
you hurry along down there?

No time to explain.
Just hold them off.

- Problem?
- For as long as I've lived here,

12:38.700 --> 12:41.738
I could never find
my father's laboratory.

12:41.739 --> 12:45.118
He hid his most prized secrets
using Vibranium and technology

12:45.119 --> 12:47.029
he stole from your grandfather.

12:47.030 --> 12:48.909
Did he really?

12:48.910 --> 12:50.989
Stand aside.

13:04.700 --> 13:08.078
Ah. I searched
for this door for years!

13:08.079 --> 13:10.029
How did you do this?

13:10.030 --> 13:12.029
Your father used
stolen Vibranium

13:12.030 --> 13:14.779
to hide this door
from Western men.

13:14.780 --> 13:16.910
I am Wakandan.

13:20.869 --> 13:22.739
Hmm.

13:25.030 --> 13:28.078
[ZEMO] This door is old.
Older than I am.

13:28.079 --> 13:30.699
Modern technology
won't work here.

13:30.700 --> 13:31.704
[GRUNTS]

13:31.729 --> 13:34.414
It seems we cannot open
the door without the key.

13:34.415 --> 13:36.291
Do you know where your
father would have hid it?

13:38.820 --> 13:41.699
- Zemo...
- Yes. I don't trust you either.

13:41.700 --> 13:43.757
But you may relax.

13:45.079 --> 13:47.779
[BLACK PANTHER]
How did you know?

13:47.780 --> 13:50.699
I recognized the lock was in
the shape of my family crest.

13:50.700 --> 13:52.868
The crest that is
also on the door.

13:52.869 --> 13:56.700
This time, my history helped us.

Finally!

14:03.141 --> 14:04.309
[ASCENDING WHIRRING]

14:04.310 --> 14:07.599
I can access my father's files
from here and erase them.

14:07.700 --> 14:11.238
Once they're gone,
so is his legacy.

14:11.239 --> 14:13.488
[GROWLS] I'm afraid I
cannot let you do that.

14:13.489 --> 14:15.578
What? But you came
down here to help me!

14:15.579 --> 14:19.578
The information on these files
is too vital to be lost.

14:19.579 --> 14:22.618
The answers they provide may help me
bring down the new Shadow Council.

14:22.619 --> 14:26.618
No! These files must be
destroyed, here and now!

14:26.619 --> 14:28.699
I'm not letting you take them.

14:28.700 --> 14:31.529
There. I have copied
all of the files.

14:31.530 --> 14:33.409
They have been wiped
from this computer.

14:33.410 --> 14:35.699
[SCOFFS] You... You think you'll
be able to decrypt them?

14:35.700 --> 14:38.409
My father's codes
are unbreakable.

14:38.410 --> 14:41.368
There is no such thing
as an unbreakable code.

14:41.369 --> 14:42.699
Not in Wakanda.

14:42.700 --> 14:44.699
Shuri, I have what I need.

14:44.700 --> 14:47.409
Prepare for extraction.

14:47.410 --> 14:51.450
- That might be difficult just now.
- <i>Two minutes, Shuri.</i>

14:53.320 --> 14:56.319
I can't let you leave here

15:19.410 --> 15:21.618
Now give me the files.

15:21.619 --> 15:23.699
You are too late, Tiger Shark.

15:23.700 --> 15:26.529
I have already downloaded
everything into my armor.

15:26.530 --> 15:30.368
Then I will just have to
kill you and take it!

Of course it is.

Still, you're scoring

Indeed. But now
we have the Zemo files.

With the help of my

[CAPTAIN AMERICA] The relic Tiger

Zemo's father called it

20:10.870 --> 20:13.778
His Shadow Council was obsessed
with discovering its secrets.

Looks like the new version
is up to the same old tricks.

believe he's had a change of heart?

I cannot say.

But I do know the pressure a son can feel
under the weight of a father's legacy.

is still struggling.

So, what happened to Zemo?
After the avalanche?
