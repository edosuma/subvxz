01:07.040 --> 01:08.479
Thank you.

01:08.560 --> 01:10.799
Oh, that's lovely. Thank you.

02:18.040 --> 02:20.319
-Lady Russell.
-My dear Anne.

02:21.400 --> 02:23.039
You look quite done for.

02:24.680 --> 02:26.879
I came back as soon as I received your letter.

02:26.960 --> 02:29.759
I had no idea the position was so ruinous.

02:29.920 --> 02:33.039
Unfortunately, a person who's contracted debts
must pay them.

02:33.440 --> 02:37.959
-Even if he is a gentleman.
-Was there no possibility of retrenchment?

02:38.520 --> 02:43.039
Unfortunately, Father and Elizabeth
could find no means of lessening their expenses

02:43.120 --> 02:45.159
without compromising their dignity,

02:45.240 --> 02:48.639
or relinquishing their comforts
in a manner simply not to be borne.

02:48.760 --> 02:51.879
But I have, at last,
persuaded Father to let out the house.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.719
And if I can ensure that we live within our means
somewhere less extravagant,

02:55.800 --> 02:58.199
then, in only a few years,
we may be solvent again.

02:58.280 --> 02:59.839
In a few years?

03:00.240 --> 03:04.999
In any event, it is better than selling.
At least one day I may hope to return.

03:05.360 --> 03:08.359
And where are you to go in the meantime?
Is it decided?

03:08.800 --> 03:11.439
All my hopes were for a small house nearby,

03:11.720 --> 03:14.759
but Father and Elizabeth are settled upon Bath.

03:18.840 --> 03:20.079
Lady Russell.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.839
Dear neighbour, you've been in London, I hear.

03:26.080 --> 03:27.879
Sir Walter. Elizabeth.

03:27.960 --> 03:31.519
May I say how truly sorry I am
that you must leave Kellynch.

03:31.840 --> 03:34.959
We are blameless, Lady Russell, quite blameless.

03:35.400 --> 03:37.639
Every sacrifice has been made, however painful.

03:37.720 --> 03:41.079
We cut off all unnecessary charities
at once, Lady Russell.

03:41.720 --> 03:45.199
And even refrain from new furnishing
the drawing room,

03:45.280 --> 03:47.999
which, as you know,
Mama left the most frightful state.

03:48.080 --> 03:51.559
And still it is a comfort to know
we've done all we could.

03:51.800 --> 03:53.159
Of course.

03:54.080 --> 03:57.439
Ah, but here's Shepherd.
He's promised us some news.

03:59.360 --> 04:00.999
Is that his daughter with him?

04:01.120 --> 04:06.159
Mrs Clay's husband passed away not long ago.
She has returned to her father's house.

04:06.400 --> 04:08.479
She's often with us, recently.

04:14.240 --> 04:16.199
Lady Russell. Miss Anne.

04:17.320 --> 04:21.959
Sir Walter, I have this very morning
received an approach for the lease of Kellynch

04:22.040 --> 04:25.599
that I'm convinced must meet
with your absolute approval.

04:25.680 --> 04:27.359
An admiral, sir,

04:28.120 --> 04:33.119
recently retired and a native of this county
desires to settle in this very part of the world.

04:33.480 --> 04:36.639
-An admiral?
-I should have much preferred a gentleman.

04:37.520 --> 04:38.919
The navy has its uses, no doubt,

04:39.000 --> 04:41.919
but I should be sorry to see
any friend of mine belonging to it.

04:42.080 --> 04:43.919
-Indeed, Sir Walter?
-Yes.

04:44.640 --> 04:46.999
It is, in two points, offensive to me.

04:47.680 --> 04:52.319
The first is being the means of raising persons
of obscure birth into undue distinction,

04:52.440 --> 04:56.439
and second, you never see a naval man
who is not most shockingly knocked about,

04:56.520 --> 05:00.039
exposed as they are to wind and weather
till they're simply not fit to be seen.

05:01.680 --> 05:05.799
Nevertheless, Sir Walter,
the admiral has a very substantial fortune,

05:06.720 --> 05:09.479
and I have no doubt of him
being a most responsible tenant.

05:10.680 --> 05:13.119
And consider, Sir Walter,

05:13.200 --> 05:16.079
how he will look around
and bless his good fortune

05:16.200 --> 05:20.599
to be in the home of a baronet
of such a prominent and distinguished family.

05:21.120 --> 05:22.119
Yes.

05:22.240 --> 05:27.079
Then, with your permission, sir,
I shall open negotiations with Admiral Croft.

05:27.920 --> 05:29.559
-Croft?
-Yes.

05:30.880 --> 05:32.479
Are you acquainted with the gentleman,
Miss Anne?

05:32.560 --> 05:34.199
Yes. No, um...

05:34.960 --> 05:38.359
That is to say, I'm familiar with his career.

05:40.280 --> 05:44.719
I'm not fond of the idea of my shrubberies
being always approachable by the tenant.

05:45.280 --> 05:48.279
If you will excuse me, there's still much to do.

06:12.840 --> 06:14.559
Good heavens, Anne.

06:16.960 --> 06:21.039
-What is the matter with you?
-Nothing. I assure you, I'm quite well.

06:22.120 --> 06:23.599
Anne...

06:26.640 --> 06:28.279
Who is Admiral Croft,

06:28.360 --> 06:31.479
and why did he cause you
to be out of countenance so?

06:35.400 --> 06:36.519
Anne!

06:37.360 --> 06:39.559
Admiral Croft's wife is...

06:41.400 --> 06:42.879
-Is...
-Mrs Croft?

06:42.960 --> 06:44.239
Indeed.

06:45.320 --> 06:50.799
And Mrs Croft is the sister
of Captain Frederick Wentworth.

06:51.800 --> 06:52.999
Wentworth?

06:54.600 --> 06:58.879
I see.

06:58.960 --> 07:02.199
And to think that soon he may be
walking through this house.

07:02.280 --> 07:06.239
Anne, you know that your father thought it
a most unsuitable match.

07:07.240 --> 07:12.279
He would never have countenanced
an alliance he deemed so degrading.

07:12.360 --> 07:14.279
He was not alone, as I recall.

07:18.080 --> 07:19.519
My dear...

07:22.600 --> 07:25.719
To become engaged at 19,

07:26.640 --> 07:30.479
in the middle of a war, to a young naval officer

07:31.400 --> 07:34.039
who had no fortune and no expectations,

07:34.880 --> 07:37.639
you would, indeed, have been
throwing yourself away.

07:38.600 --> 07:43.719
And I should have been failing in my duty
as your godmother if I did not counsel against it.

07:47.920 --> 07:49.119
You were young,

07:50.240 --> 07:53.599
and it was entirely prudent to break off

07:54.640 --> 07:55.799
the understanding.

07:55.880 --> 07:58.319
Prudent it may have been and yet,

07:58.640 --> 08:01.559
Captain Wentworth has
made his fortune in the war

08:01.880 --> 08:03.719
and is now extremely wealthy.

08:04.880 --> 08:06.839
Has he written to you?

08:09.280 --> 08:10.879
No, never a word.

08:12.120 --> 08:15.079
I've only the newspapers for my authority.

08:15.840 --> 08:21.439
Then...if his intentions towards you
had been truly sincere,

08:22.600 --> 08:26.159
would he not have contacted you
when his circumstances changed?

08:30.160 --> 08:31.639
I do not blame you,

08:32.799 --> 08:35.799
nor myself for having been led by you.

08:37.640 --> 08:39.119
But nevertheless,

08:39.880 --> 08:44.359
I think very differently now from
what I was persuaded to think eight years ago.

08:44.840 --> 08:46.919
Oh, my dear Anne.

08:48.600 --> 08:53.039
You are a good and beautiful young woman.
I promise you this,

08:54.760 --> 08:58.039
one day you will find someone
to love you as you deserve.

09:01.440 --> 09:02.799
I'm 27.

09:13.040 --> 09:14.679
Before I forget, Shepherd,

09:16.320 --> 09:19.999
if you have no objection, I have a mind
to engage your charming daughter

09:20.080 --> 09:22.519
as a companion to Elizabeth.

09:23.080 --> 09:24.479
Oh, Sir Walter.

09:26.240 --> 09:29.959
Well, I'm sure, sir, Penelope will be
greatly honoured by such a distinction.

09:30.040 --> 09:34.119
Then it is settled.
She shall come with us to Bath tomorrow.

09:35.680 --> 09:38.719
Is not Anne companion enough for Elizabeth?

09:38.960 --> 09:41.199
Oh, but Anne is going to Uppercross.

09:41.960 --> 09:45.199
I received a letter only this morning
from sister Mary.

09:45.440 --> 09:50.599
She is indisposed, again,
and requires Anne to come and look after her.

09:51.560 --> 09:53.959
And since nobody would want Anne in Bath,

09:54.080 --> 09:59.039
I wrote back straightaway to say she should come
as soon as she'd finished everything here.

09:59.160 --> 10:00.399
Well...

10:03.040 --> 10:05.759
All your hopes were for a small house nearby.

10:07.200 --> 10:09.839
Do send our regards to the Musgroves.

11:00.440 --> 11:01.639
Before you go, Anne,

11:01.760 --> 11:07.559
on no account must you forget to visit each house
in the parish to take our leave. It is expected.

11:17.360 --> 11:18.959
Is he married?

11:19.600 --> 11:21.239
I do not know that he is,

11:22.000 --> 11:26.639
and yet, so eligible a gentleman would surely
by now have formed an attachment.

11:27.800 --> 11:29.959
Will he bring his wife here?

11:31.040 --> 11:32.479
And his children?

11:34.320 --> 11:37.119
I only pray that I am spared any meeting.

11:38.400 --> 11:41.639
I know my chance of happiness
has passed forever,

11:42.560 --> 11:45.999
but to be reminded of it
by his presence here would,

11:46.080 --> 11:49.879
I'm certain, be more than my spirits could bear.

11:52.880 --> 11:54.439
Who is that young lady, Mr Shepherd?

11:54.520 --> 11:57.839
Oh, that is Miss Anne Elliot, Admiral,
Sir Walter's middle daughter.

11:58.080 --> 11:59.559
The only one with any sense.

11:59.640 --> 12:01.759
A pity, then,
that we did not make her acquaintance.

12:01.840 --> 12:04.719
She is but half a mile away
at Uppercross with her sister.

12:04.800 --> 12:07.519
Oh, well then, we certainly shall
make her acquaintance.

12:07.680 --> 12:09.439
Is she married, Mr Shepherd?

12:09.640 --> 12:13.279
Sadly no, ma'am.
Nor, I think, at her age, is likely to be.

12:19.600 --> 12:20.759
Well.

12:21.440 --> 12:24.039
It is certainly roomier than a frigate.

12:51.320 --> 12:55.839
Such a number of looking glasses.
There's no getting away from oneself.

12:56.040 --> 12:58.959
I think this room would do very well for Frederick.

12:59.240 --> 13:00.959
Let us see if he comes.

13:01.240 --> 13:04.119
Your brother seems dead set against
the whole idea of Kellynch.

13:04.200 --> 13:07.119
I fear Somerset has unpleasant memories for him.

13:07.200 --> 13:10.479
There was once talk of an engagement
to a girl in the county.

13:10.560 --> 13:12.999
-There was?
-Eight years ago or so.

13:13.400 --> 13:15.679
We were in the East Indies at the time.

13:15.760 --> 13:18.719
He's never spoken of it,
but his heart was quite broken, I believe.

13:18.800 --> 13:20.039
Well, well, well.

13:20.520 --> 13:23.719
-Frederick engaged, who would have thought it?
-Indeed.

13:24.240 --> 13:28.519
-I sometimes wonder if he will ever settle down.
-Hmm.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.599
So, you are come, at last.

13:45.640 --> 13:48.079
I'd begun to think I should never see you.

13:49.200 --> 13:51.359
I am so ill

13:53.360 --> 13:55.199
I can hardly speak.

13:56.480 --> 14:01.439
In fact, I do not think I was ever so ill in my life
as I have been all this morning.

14:01.760 --> 14:04.919
I'm very unfit to be left alone, I'm sure.

14:05.760 --> 14:07.359
Is Charles not here?

14:07.520 --> 14:11.399
Charles would go out shooting,
even though I told him I was ill.

14:11.720 --> 14:17.239
And I have not seen a soul
this whole, long morning.

14:18.960 --> 14:22.559
Not one of the Musgroves has seen fit
to come and see me

14:23.040 --> 14:25.799
even though Charles told them I was ill.

14:26.640 --> 14:28.799
It did not suit, I suppose.

14:29.880 --> 14:34.279
Oh, you will see them yet, I'm sure.
It is still early.

14:36.600 --> 14:40.359
Or, perhaps, if you feel well enough
to attempt a short walk

14:40.440 --> 14:43.239
to the great house, we could call upon them.

14:43.520 --> 14:46.599
We ought to wait till they call upon you.

14:46.680 --> 14:49.519
They should know what is due to you as my sister.

14:49.600 --> 14:53.039
I assure you I have not the smallest objection
on that account.

14:55.480 --> 14:57.759
Perhaps a little air would do me good.

14:58.760 --> 15:01.719
But I really must eat something first,
I'm quite starved.

15:02.920 --> 15:04.439
Anne!

15:08.280 --> 15:11.439
-Good heavens! How the girls are growing up.
-Mmm-Hmm.

15:12.240 --> 15:15.079
The Miss Musgroves have returned
from their school in Exeter

15:15.160 --> 15:18.359
with all the usual accomplishments,
and, of course,

15:18.440 --> 15:21.559
they now think of nothing but being fashionable

15:21.680 --> 15:23.119
and merry...

15:24.960 --> 15:27.039
Dear Henrietta, Louisa!

15:27.840 --> 15:29.159
Oh, Anne!

15:29.640 --> 15:33.159
Here you are at last!
Come, Mama cannot wait to see you.

15:33.400 --> 15:35.599
And we have such exciting news.

15:57.520 --> 16:00.239
Welcome to Uppercross, Miss Anne!

16:02.960 --> 16:05.119
How pale and drawn you are.

16:05.320 --> 16:07.599
We must fatten you up while you are here.

16:08.400 --> 16:11.479
I myself have been very unwell.

16:12.040 --> 16:16.799
And Sir Walter and Miss Elizabeth.
Oh, how they shall miss you.

16:16.880 --> 16:20.119
In any event, I'm very happy to be here
and not in Bath.

16:20.240 --> 16:22.679
Oh, Mama, I hope we shall be in Bath this winter.

16:22.760 --> 16:25.119
But remember, if we do go,
we must be in a good situation.

16:25.200 --> 16:27.919
Oh, yes. None of your Queen's Squares for us.

16:30.120 --> 16:33.959
-Anne, how are you?
-Very well. Thank you, Charles.

16:37.600 --> 16:40.239
-You're getting big.
-I am glad to see you've recovered, my dear.

16:40.360 --> 16:43.959
Did you ask your father? Did you, Charles?

16:44.280 --> 16:48.959
Father has many other uses for his money
and the right to spend it as he likes.

16:49.280 --> 16:52.679
Charles, if it is left to you,
we shall soon be destitute.

16:52.880 --> 16:55.799
Admiral Croft and his wife
are to take possession directly.

16:55.880 --> 16:58.519
And I believe we have been very fortunate
with our tenants.

16:58.600 --> 17:02.199
Yet it must be very hard for you, my dear,
to give up your home so.

17:02.320 --> 17:06.239
Of course, when your poor dear Mama was alive,
there was moderation and economy at Kellynch.

17:06.319 --> 17:07.759
But there were never balls,

17:07.880 --> 17:12.319
and the Crofts are sure to have balls
and invite the most eligible young naval officers.

17:12.400 --> 17:15.358
Indeed, this is our exciting news, I quite forgot.

17:15.440 --> 17:19.319
Mrs Croft, it appears,
has a brother, Captain Wentworth,

17:19.440 --> 17:22.919
and he has just returned to England
and is coming to stay with them at Kellynch.

17:23.000 --> 17:27.719
It is true. The Pooles chanced to make
their acquaintance in Taunton this week.

17:27.880 --> 17:31.279
It is said Captain Wentworth
is the most handsomest man

17:31.360 --> 17:33.439
in the navy and quite unattached.

17:33.520 --> 17:36.119
-And has such a wealth of Spanish gold.
-Indeed.

17:36.640 --> 17:38.359
How fortunate he is.

17:38.440 --> 17:43.159
Well, we shall all see for ourselves
when he comes to dine tomorrow night.

17:43.520 --> 17:44.759
Oh, Papa!

17:44.880 --> 17:49.399
I have just now received this note
from Admiral Croft accepting my invitation.

17:58.320 --> 18:01.759
Anne! Are you ready?

18:05.960 --> 18:09.519
We must not keep the Crofts
and Captain Wentworth waiting.

18:17.680 --> 18:20.239
Charles! Charles!

18:21.680 --> 18:25.039
Charles! Come directly. Charles!

18:44.720 --> 18:46.799
He fell from a tree in the garden.

18:57.000 --> 19:00.719
I've sent for the apothecary.
He will be here directly.

19:01.200 --> 19:02.959
His collarbone is dislocated.

19:05.080 --> 19:07.879
Charles, look after Mary. We shall be all right.

19:11.560 --> 19:13.079
Ready?

19:20.480 --> 19:23.799
All done. With a little rest,
he'll be right as rain in no time.

19:23.880 --> 19:25.039
Oh, thank God.

19:25.120 --> 19:29.239
And never fear, Charles,
I shall give your excuses to the Crofts.

19:29.320 --> 19:32.199
Excuses?

19:32.320 --> 19:36.479
Indeed, with the child going on so well now,
it would be a shame to spoil the dinner.

19:36.640 --> 19:39.359
I am really most anxious to meet
our new neighbours.

19:39.440 --> 19:42.239
Indeed, it's more a duty than anything else.

19:43.120 --> 19:46.399
If Anne will stay with you,
my love, I have no scruple at all.

19:46.480 --> 19:47.919
Of course.

19:49.120 --> 19:52.119
And so we are to be left to shift for ourselves

19:52.200 --> 19:56.919
with a sick child,
while you go to dinner with the Crofts.

19:57.320 --> 19:58.719
Well, I need not stay too late, dearest.

19:58.840 --> 20:02.839
Just because I'm the poor mother who is not
allowed to stir, because he is going on so well.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.839
He says... How does he know
he is going on so well...

20:05.920 --> 20:09.439
Please.

20:10.760 --> 20:13.519
You may all leave little Charles to my care.

20:15.800 --> 20:19.079
Well, this is very kind of you, Anne.
Are you sure?

20:19.160 --> 20:21.239
In any case, I've no appetite.

20:21.840 --> 20:24.679
Well then, it is settled.

21:06.880 --> 21:10.279
Oh, Anne, you missed
the most delightful party last night.

21:10.360 --> 21:13.559
I cannot tell you how handsome
is Captain Wentworth.

21:13.680 --> 21:17.639
He is so much more handsome and
agreeable than anyone I have ever met before.

21:17.720 --> 21:20.519
-Such manners, such conversation.
-Such capital.

21:20.640 --> 21:24.159
Oh, and we have all been invited to Kellynch
tomorrow night for dinner.

21:24.640 --> 21:25.759
Even you, Anne.

21:25.840 --> 21:28.439
- Damn it, Mary, I'm late. Is he here?
- Who?

21:29.200 --> 21:31.959
Oh, Captain Wentworth, do...do come in.

21:34.520 --> 21:36.799
Forgive me, I... The door was open.

21:38.400 --> 21:39.719
I trust the boy does well?

21:39.800 --> 21:42.719
-Oh, yes.
-Much better, thank you, Wentworth.

21:45.120 --> 21:48.399
Oh, Captain Wentworth,
this is my elder sister Anne.

21:52.560 --> 21:57.439
-We are acquainted.
-Really? But Anne has never said a word about it.

21:59.240 --> 22:01.319
It was a long time ago, you were away at school.

22:01.400 --> 22:04.359
Come, Wentworth, or the birds will
all have gone south for the winter.

22:04.440 --> 22:06.919
Of course. Ladies.

22:10.080 --> 22:12.999
Oh, come, Henrietta, let us go with them.

22:13.080 --> 22:14.799
Wait, wait, wait for me.

22:20.360 --> 22:23.279
The worst is over. I have seen him.

22:25.160 --> 22:27.639
We have been once more in the same room.

22:29.600 --> 22:31.639
A bow, a curtsy,

22:33.160 --> 22:36.159
I heard his voice and then,

22:37.320 --> 22:38.559
he was gone.

22:40.360 --> 22:41.959
He has not forgiven me.

22:43.360 --> 22:46.959
I have used him ill,
deserted and disappointed him.

22:48.600 --> 22:52.199
And worse, I've shown a feebleness of character
in doing so,

22:52.760 --> 22:56.399
which his own decided, confident temper
could not endure.

22:59.440 --> 23:01.959
Once there were no two hearts so open,

23:03.000 --> 23:04.839
no feelings so in harmony,

23:06.280 --> 23:07.999
but now we are strangers.

23:09.440 --> 23:11.319
Worse than strangers

23:12.560 --> 23:14.679
for we may never become acquainted.

23:15.880 --> 23:18.079
It is perpetual estrangement.

23:19.000 --> 23:22.199
And tonight, I'm to be tested once more.

23:28.080 --> 23:32.239
Frederick! There you are.
Let me introduce you to Miss Anne Elliot.

23:32.440 --> 23:35.439
Miss Elliot, my brother,
Captain Frederick Wentworth.

23:38.920 --> 23:42.079
Captain Wentworth and I met briefly yesterday.

23:42.400 --> 23:45.559
Oh, Frederick, you might have told me.

23:46.080 --> 23:49.639
This must be very bad for you, Miss Elliot,
to come to your home and find us here.

23:49.760 --> 23:54.559
No, not at all, Admiral. I'm happy to know that
the house is in such worthy and careful hands.

24:02.560 --> 24:05.359
And what news, Frederick,
of dear Captain Harville?

24:05.440 --> 24:08.359
He's settled for now at LYme
with our good friend James Benwick

24:08.440 --> 24:09.919
-who's awaiting a new command.
-How exciting.

24:10.000 --> 24:14.239
Of course. I remember Captain Benwick.
He's engaged to Harville's sister.

24:14.640 --> 24:18.119
I'm sorry to have to tell you that she died
last summer while Benwick was out at the Cape.

24:18.400 --> 24:21.439
-Oh, no. How dreadful.
-Yes.

24:22.560 --> 24:25.959
Five years they waited for a fortune
to satisfy her family.

24:26.320 --> 24:31.239
Now he has it, of course, but too late.
Much too late.

24:31.760 --> 24:33.839
But then I've never thought
that a man on active service

24:33.920 --> 24:36.719
-should even contemplate marriage.
-Have you indeed?

24:36.800 --> 24:38.919
A frigate at wartime is no place for a woman

24:39.000 --> 24:42.399
and the long separations
are a sore trial to both parties.

24:42.480 --> 24:46.519
Oh, how true.
There is nothing so bad as a separation.

24:46.640 --> 24:50.679
As I know to my cost,
for Mr Musgrove always attends the assizes

24:50.760 --> 24:53.999
and I'm so glad when he's safe home again.

24:54.120 --> 24:57.079
But now I'm paid off and ashore, Sophy,
you'll be delighted to hear

24:57.160 --> 25:00.399
that I'm, at last, resolved to settle down.

25:01.320 --> 25:06.359
Indeed, Frederick, I'm delighted to hear it.
Pray, do you have anyone in mind?

25:06.480 --> 25:10.839
No, no, I'm quite ready to make a foolish match
with any woman between 15 and 30.

25:11.960 --> 25:16.199
A little beauty, a few smiles, and a compliment
to the navy and I shall be lost.

25:16.280 --> 25:17.479
Oh, come, Frederick.

25:17.560 --> 25:21.199
After all, what right has a humble sailor
to expect any better?

25:24.000 --> 25:26.279
But if I am to speak in earnest,

25:27.960 --> 25:31.999
what I desire above all in a wife
is firmness of character.

25:34.560 --> 25:36.719
A woman who knows her own mind.

25:38.360 --> 25:41.519
I cannot abide timidity or feebleness of purpose.

25:43.320 --> 25:47.039
A weak spirit which is always open to persuasion,
first one way and then the other,

25:47.120 --> 25:48.839
can never be relied upon.

25:49.280 --> 25:51.799
Well, we must see what we can do.

26:41.120 --> 26:43.119
Oh, Anne, play us something to dance to.

26:43.240 --> 26:47.559
-Yes, Anne, will you? Something jolly.
-Oh, yes.

27:37.640 --> 27:40.639
Do you know, I believe that I've never seen
a pleasanter man in all my life

27:40.720 --> 27:41.879
than Captain Wentworth.

27:42.080 --> 27:43.519
Hmm.

27:43.960 --> 27:46.839
He was not very gallant by Anne, though, was he?

27:46.960 --> 27:50.359
When Louisa asked him what he thought of you
the other night

27:50.440 --> 27:55.599
he said you were so altered,
he should not have known you again.

27:56.480 --> 28:01.639
-I would not swear he used exactly those words.
-Although he was most attentive to me.

28:01.800 --> 28:03.599
It must be said he would make a capital match
for Louisa.

28:03.720 --> 28:09.039
Louisa! Stuff and nonsense, Charles.
It is clear he is all for Henrietta.

28:09.160 --> 28:13.559
But, my love, surely you cannot have forgotten
that Henrietta has an understanding

28:13.640 --> 28:16.439
-with my cousin, Charles Hayter.
-Indeed, I have not.

28:17.040 --> 28:19.559
But I cannot say the same of Henrietta.

28:19.640 --> 28:21.679
And quite right, too.

28:21.840 --> 28:26.399
For who, pray, is Charles Hayter?
Nothing but a country curate.

28:26.840 --> 28:29.599
What a degrading alliance
for a connection of the Elliots.

28:29.680 --> 28:33.559
Now, there you talk nonsense, my dear.
He will inherit the estate at Winthrop,

28:33.920 --> 28:36.399
and the farm near Taunton,
and he is a very amiable young man.

28:36.520 --> 28:40.679
Well, I do not think a young woman has the right
to marry anyone, however amiable

28:40.760 --> 28:43.319
if he is disagreeable or inconvenient to her family.

28:43.400 --> 28:45.079
No, no, what stuff.

28:45.200 --> 28:48.639
If Henrietta has Charles Hayter
and Louisa can get Captain Wentworth,

28:48.720 --> 28:50.759
I shall be very well satisfied.

28:51.560 --> 28:55.319
Well, what do you say, Anne?
Does the Captain prefer Louisa or Henrietta?

28:55.760 --> 28:57.239
Wentworth!

28:59.000 --> 29:03.639
We're just going over to Winthrop
to visit Cousin Charles, Henrietta's intended.

29:03.760 --> 29:06.919
Why don't you come with us, Anne.
I'm sure the Hayters would love to see you again.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.279
Capital idea, Louisa, we shall all go.

29:09.360 --> 29:11.919
I know Mary's in a fine sweat
to see Cousin Charles again.

29:30.800 --> 29:32.799
Catch me.

30:20.120 --> 30:21.399
Anne!

30:27.720 --> 30:29.479
It is nothing.

30:30.160 --> 30:32.239
Thank you. I'm well.

30:34.200 --> 30:36.039
It is really nothing.

30:38.760 --> 30:42.559
But I think, perhaps, I'd better stay here
and rest a little while.

30:42.640 --> 30:46.279
-Then I shall remain with you.
-No, please, I...

30:46.520 --> 30:50.759
I would hate to inconvenience you and I...
I know my way to Winthrop perfectly well.

30:51.720 --> 30:53.479
I shall catch up with you directly.

30:55.680 --> 30:57.119
Please, Charles.

30:58.200 --> 31:00.799
Very well. If you insist.

31:15.720 --> 31:19.399
Ah, see? There is Winthrop.

31:26.800 --> 31:30.399
You had all better go on without me.
I am really excessively tired.

31:32.920 --> 31:35.679
It would be very rude of us to come all this way
and not call on our cousins.

31:35.800 --> 31:37.839
I will stay with Mary, Charles.

31:37.920 --> 31:41.159
If you and Henrietta want to go on
and pay our respects to the Hayters.

31:41.720 --> 31:45.279
And I am sure Captain Wentworth will offer us
his protection.

31:46.440 --> 31:47.639
Very well.

31:48.640 --> 31:50.279
Henrietta.

31:53.840 --> 31:58.159
It is most unpleasant, having such connections,
Captain Wentworth.

31:58.440 --> 32:01.359
But I assure you,
I have never been in that house above twice.

32:01.440 --> 32:02.799
In my life.

32:07.120 --> 32:09.719
I wonder where Anne has got to.

32:15.640 --> 32:18.719
Mary is good-natured enough
in many respects.

32:18.840 --> 32:22.679
But she does sometimes provoke me excessively
by her nonsense.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.999
She has a great deal too much of the Elliot pride.

32:27.400 --> 32:29.759
You know, we all wish Charles
had married Anne instead.

32:29.840 --> 32:33.119
-Anne?
-Oh, yes.

32:34.240 --> 32:38.359
-Did you not know he wanted to marry Anne?
-No. I did not.

32:38.800 --> 32:43.159
-Do you mean to say she refused him?
-Oh, yes, certainly.

32:43.760 --> 32:45.159
When did this happen?

32:45.760 --> 32:49.799
I do not exactly know, but before he married Mary.

32:55.200 --> 32:57.599
Did she say why she would not marry?

32:58.680 --> 33:00.119
Well...

33:00.720 --> 33:04.519
Papa always said it was
her great friend Lady Russell's doing.

33:05.080 --> 33:09.199
He thought Charles might not be bookish enough
to please Lady Russell,

33:09.280 --> 33:12.439
and so she persuaded Anne to refuse him.

33:13.920 --> 33:17.559
I myself would have no idea of being
so easily persuaded.

33:18.160 --> 33:20.839
When I have made up my mind, I have made it.

33:21.080 --> 33:22.799
And I'm quite determined.

33:22.920 --> 33:25.839
Yours is a character, I see,
of decision and firmness.

33:26.800 --> 33:28.479
And I honour it.

33:30.040 --> 33:34.199
Oh, look. They have brought Charles Hayter
with them. Come.

34:14.280 --> 34:16.399
Ah! There you are.

34:16.480 --> 34:19.559
We thought we might cross your wake
if we drove out this way.

34:19.639 --> 34:21.599
Admiral Croft, Mrs Croft.

34:22.040 --> 34:24.159
We've just paid a visit to my cousin,
Charles Hayter.

34:24.239 --> 34:25.399
Oh.

34:25.520 --> 34:29.799
Miss Elliot, you must be tired. Do let us have
the pleasure of taking you home to Uppercross.

34:29.880 --> 34:31.879
Oh, no, thank you, no. It is too much trouble.

34:32.000 --> 34:36.119
Oh, no, we are returning in any case by that road
and there's plenty of room.

34:36.199 --> 34:38.359
- Really, you're too kind.
- Stuff, Miss Elliot.

34:38.480 --> 34:40.518
-You must come with us, indeed you must.
-Oh.

34:43.080 --> 34:44.918
- Walk on.
-Thank you, Captain.

34:52.360 --> 34:54.518
I wish Frederick would spread a little more canvas

34:54.639 --> 34:57.879
and bring home one of those two young ladies
to Kellynch.

34:57.960 --> 35:01.879
He means to have one of them.
There's just no saying which one.

35:03.400 --> 35:07.279
They're both very good-natured,
unaffected girls, indeed.

35:07.720 --> 35:11.199
They're a very respectable family.
What do you think, Miss Elliot?

35:13.440 --> 35:16.399
It won't be long, if I'm any judge.

35:26.200 --> 35:28.279
Now I understand him.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.799
He can never forgive me.

35:32.240 --> 35:36.599
He condemns me still for the past and is
becoming now quite attached to another.

35:39.240 --> 35:40.399
And yet...

35:40.480 --> 35:44.079
Anne! We are to go to LYme
tomorrow morning.

35:44.160 --> 35:45.959
Captain Wentworth must visit his best friend,

35:46.040 --> 35:49.879
Captain... Something or other.

35:50.040 --> 35:53.599
And has invited us all to make the trip with him.
Ain't it prime?

35:54.360 --> 35:57.559
No, indeed, I'm sure I'd better stay here
with the children.

35:58.240 --> 36:02.039
Am I to go without you?

36:02.520 --> 36:05.399
In my delicate state of recovery?

36:07.080 --> 36:11.199
Suppose I were to be seized rather suddenly
in some dreadful way

36:11.280 --> 36:13.639
and not able to ring the bell for servants?

36:18.960 --> 36:21.119
Quite attached to another.

36:22.200 --> 36:23.359
And yet...

36:24.640 --> 36:27.039
Still he cannot be unfeeling.

36:27.800 --> 36:31.239
He cannot see me suffer
without wishing to give relief,

36:32.720 --> 36:36.399
to spare the proof of his own good,
warm and amiable heart,

36:38.360 --> 36:42.279
which I cannot contemplate without infinite pain

36:43.680 --> 36:44.799
and regret.

37:12.800 --> 37:15.359
The sea!

37:15.440 --> 37:18.159
-I love the sea!
-I'm sure I love it more than you do.

37:34.720 --> 37:36.119
Frederick!

37:37.120 --> 37:39.079
Come on!

37:58.320 --> 38:02.119
Captain Harry Harville, Captain James Benwick,
Mr and Mrs Charles Musgrove.

38:02.240 --> 38:06.759
Miss Henrietta Musgrove, Miss Louisa Musgrove,
Miss Elliot.

38:06.920 --> 38:08.599
Miss Anne Elliot?

38:10.040 --> 38:11.199
Yes.

38:12.280 --> 38:13.439
Capital.

38:14.760 --> 38:16.599
Oh, my God, the air!

38:16.680 --> 38:19.319
Of course, the admiralty
amuse themselves every now and then

38:19.400 --> 38:22.559
by sending a few hundred men to sea
in a ship not fit to be employed.

38:22.880 --> 38:24.239
-It's true.
-But they do have a great many...

38:24.320 --> 38:26.639
Captain Benwick,

38:26.720 --> 38:30.519
may I say how sorry I was
to hear of your terrible loss.

38:32.000 --> 38:33.439
Thank you.

38:34.800 --> 38:36.639
There never was a love like ours.

38:37.720 --> 38:38.999
And never will be again.

38:39.080 --> 38:40.199
There were a great many to provide for

38:40.280 --> 38:43.239
and among the thousands that
may just as well go to the bottom as not,

38:43.360 --> 38:45.959
it is impossible for them to distinguish which
may be least missed.

38:49.640 --> 38:52.239
And yet, Captain,

38:54.000 --> 38:55.639
you are still young,

38:56.200 --> 38:58.559
and I pray you may one day rally

38:59.640 --> 39:01.119
and be happy with another.

39:01.240 --> 39:04.559
A man does not forget a woman
as readily as you forget us.

39:06.040 --> 39:09.599
I will not allow a woman's nature to be
more unconstant than a man's.

39:11.440 --> 39:13.679
And yet, you will allow that poetry

39:14.160 --> 39:16.199
and novels are against you.

39:16.880 --> 39:19.799
They tell us endlessly of the fickleness of women.

39:21.120 --> 39:23.159
And are they not all written by men?

39:27.120 --> 39:31.359
Yes, Miss Elliot. Perhaps they are.

39:33.080 --> 39:35.679
I see we shall not readily agree on this.

39:36.560 --> 39:41.199
I would never suppose that true constancy
is known only by women,

39:42.560 --> 39:45.639
but the one claim I shall make for my own sex

39:47.000 --> 39:48.999
is that we love longest

39:50.760 --> 39:52.399
when all hope is gone.

39:56.760 --> 39:59.039
A toast. The navy.

39:59.160 --> 40:00.159
The navy.

40:00.240 --> 40:01.439
The navy.

40:07.000 --> 40:10.959
You did a good deed.
Cheering up so with poor Benwick last night.

40:13.360 --> 40:15.159
I've not known him talk so much.

40:15.880 --> 40:17.359
Not in a long time.

40:19.400 --> 40:24.039
In time, we found a common interest in poetry.

40:24.480 --> 40:28.439
He reads nothing else. Day in, day out.

40:29.680 --> 40:34.279
Never happier he is than when reading
impassioned descriptions of hopeless agony

40:35.080 --> 40:37.439
or sundered hearts destroyed by wretchedness.

40:38.520 --> 40:39.839
Yes.

40:40.040 --> 40:44.639
I did venture to recommend a larger allowance
of prose in his daily study.

40:50.440 --> 40:53.039
It's bad for him, I know,

40:53.760 --> 40:55.959
to be shut up as he is.

40:58.640 --> 41:00.119
But what can we do?

41:02.160 --> 41:03.919
Well, he's young.

41:04.840 --> 41:06.639
And time is a great healer.

41:10.720 --> 41:12.759
Or so, at least, I'm told.

42:51.920 --> 42:53.079
Oh.

42:54.240 --> 42:57.319
-Forgive me.
-Not at all.

43:14.520 --> 43:16.279
Who is that gentleman?

43:18.320 --> 43:22.079
Mr William Elliot, sir. Came in last night
on his way to Bath for the winter.

43:22.160 --> 43:27.519
William Elliot? Bless me, Anne, it must be
our cousin William. It must, indeed!

43:29.280 --> 43:31.559
- He is handsome!
-He is not!

43:31.720 --> 43:35.439
Did he mention a connection to
the Elliots of Kellynch at all?

43:35.600 --> 43:38.119
He certainly said he would one day be a baronet.

43:38.240 --> 43:40.279
There. It is him, it is.

43:41.160 --> 43:43.599
He seems of particular interest,
this cousin?

43:43.680 --> 43:46.079
Sir Walter has no sons,

43:46.160 --> 43:49.159
so his title and the estate of Kellynch
will pass to the cousin.

43:51.880 --> 43:55.559
What a pity we should not have been
introduced to each other.

43:56.600 --> 44:02.519
His father and Mr Elliot have not been
on speaking terms since his unfortunate marriage.

44:02.600 --> 44:05.439
An introduction would have hardly been welcome.

44:05.520 --> 44:07.879
You'll hardly be able
to avoid seeing each other in Bath.

44:07.960 --> 44:10.919
You'll be sure to mention our seeing him
next time you write to Father.

44:11.800 --> 44:14.039
On the contrary.

44:14.880 --> 44:17.079
Do you think he had the Elliot countenance?

44:34.080 --> 44:36.399
-Captain Wentworth, catch me.
-Louisa.

44:39.840 --> 44:42.319
-Louisa. Louisa, no! Louisa, no!
-I am determined. I will.

44:42.400 --> 44:45.439
Louisa!

44:46.960 --> 44:49.999
A surgeon. A surgeon, quickly.

44:50.080 --> 44:51.919
-Of course.
-Captain Benwick.

44:52.000 --> 44:54.279
Captain Benwick knows where one can be found.

44:54.360 --> 44:55.439
Send him to the inn.

44:57.640 --> 45:00.119
Keep this pressed firmly against the wound.

45:23.240 --> 45:25.359
Charles,

45:26.400 --> 45:30.239
it appears she'll be here some time.
Her parents should be told.

45:30.320 --> 45:33.319
But I would rather not leave her. Not tonight.

45:33.400 --> 45:37.999
Let me go. And if you wish,
I'll take Henrietta and Mary with me.

45:38.080 --> 45:39.639
And not Anne?

45:39.960 --> 45:43.119
If Anne will stay,
there is no one so proper, so capable.

45:43.200 --> 45:44.999
Louisa needs no other.

45:45.080 --> 45:48.479
But Anne...

45:48.560 --> 45:54.399
Anne is to stay, who is nothing to Louisa,
while I am sent packing?

45:54.600 --> 45:55.919
Now, my dear, I'm sure the captain...

45:56.000 --> 45:59.159
-Am I not as capable as Anne?
-Of course you are.

45:59.240 --> 46:01.359
Am I not as proper?

46:01.520 --> 46:06.399
And to be sent home without Charles, too,
without my husband, in my condition, no.

46:06.800 --> 46:09.119
No, it is too unkind.

46:11.880 --> 46:13.919
I will go with Henrietta.

47:12.600 --> 47:13.879
Go on.

47:22.360 --> 47:23.999
Miss Elliot,

47:24.080 --> 47:26.599
I've been thinking whether you
had not better remain with Henrietta

47:26.680 --> 47:29.319
while I go in and break it to the Musgrove's alone.

47:29.400 --> 47:31.599
Do you think this is a good plan?

47:32.480 --> 47:34.159
I do.

47:56.800 --> 47:58.999
I must see Mr Musgrove without delay.

47:59.120 --> 48:03.359
Tell him Captain Frederick Wentworth is here.
I must speak with him directly.

48:25.360 --> 48:27.359
It is done.

48:28.440 --> 48:31.319
I shall return now to LYme
and see if I can be of any...

48:31.400 --> 48:33.039
any assistance.

48:34.320 --> 48:37.239
I believe the Musgroves will soon follow.

48:38.360 --> 48:39.839
Thank you.

48:41.720 --> 48:43.359
Captain,

48:44.240 --> 48:46.439
I'm most anxious.

48:47.240 --> 48:49.359
If you would have...

48:49.520 --> 48:54.279
If you'd be so kind as to have word sent to me
in Bath as to how Louisa does.

48:56.040 --> 48:57.999
In Bath?

48:58.080 --> 49:01.079
I'm not needed in LYme
or any longer at Uppercross.

49:01.160 --> 49:03.599
I must rejoin my father.

49:04.360 --> 49:06.919
Our house is in Camden Place.

49:09.320 --> 49:12.679
-You dislike Bath most heartily, as I recall.
-I do.

49:13.560 --> 49:16.679
But I have an old school friend
who lives there and...

49:16.760 --> 49:20.199
I have the consolation also
of Lady Russell's company.

49:21.960 --> 49:24.079
Very well, then.

49:24.880 --> 49:27.479
Goodbye, Miss Elliot.

49:49.040 --> 49:51.279
Goodbye, Captain Wentworth.

50:21.440 --> 50:23.839
Certainly now, with Anne here,

50:23.920 --> 50:26.319
I'll not suppose myself at all wanted.

50:26.440 --> 50:30.879
Nonsense, Penelope, she is nothing to me,
indeed, compared to you.

50:30.960 --> 50:34.279
My dear madam, you must not
run away from us now. It must not be.

50:34.360 --> 50:36.559
Please, Penelope.

50:39.080 --> 50:42.759
Ah, Anne, there you are.

50:44.240 --> 50:46.839
How are you, Anne?

50:46.920 --> 50:49.119
Are we greatly missed at Kellynch?

50:49.240 --> 50:54.079
But let me assure you, Bath has more
than answered our expectations in every respect.

50:54.160 --> 50:58.519
Indeed, our house is undoubtedly
the finest in Camden Place.

50:59.480 --> 51:03.839
You can be sure that the acquaintance
of the Elliots is most exceedingly sought after.

51:04.160 --> 51:07.919
And best of all, Miss Anne,
your cousin Mr Elliot is here in Bath

51:08.000 --> 51:11.159
and is quite reconciled with Sir Walter.

51:11.600 --> 51:15.039
-Mr Elliot?
-Indeed, he has called repeatedly,

51:15.120 --> 51:17.759
has dined with us once.

51:17.840 --> 51:22.439
Evidently delighted
at the distinction of being asked.

51:23.000 --> 51:28.239
And clearly places his whole happiness
in being on intimate terms in Camden Place.

51:29.400 --> 51:32.199
He has offered his most handsome apologies

51:32.280 --> 51:36.999
for any former appearance of neglect
in his duties towards us.

51:37.920 --> 51:40.999
And Mrs Elliot?

51:41.280 --> 51:43.599
Dead. Quite dead.

51:44.080 --> 51:47.239
Certainly his wife was a nobody,

51:47.400 --> 51:49.999
while a beauty and rich,

51:50.080 --> 51:53.279
but we must make allowances,
he was young and foolish.

51:53.360 --> 51:57.159
Not any more. Such elegant manners.

51:57.240 --> 52:00.879
So gentlemanly and fashionable.

52:00.960 --> 52:03.999
Indeed, I have no objection
to being seen with him anywhere.

52:05.840 --> 52:09.039
-Ah, that will be Lady Russell, no doubt.
-No.

52:09.120 --> 52:13.319
That is Mr Elliot's knock. I am sure of it.

52:13.400 --> 52:15.759
I believe you are right.

52:15.840 --> 52:19.519
The poor man simply cannot keep away
from you, Miss Elliot.

52:19.600 --> 52:21.959
Upon my word, Penelope.

52:22.040 --> 52:27.279
I am scarcely aware of his intentions
being beyond those of other men.

52:32.000 --> 52:34.719
How is Mary looking?

52:34.800 --> 52:37.799
Last time I saw her she was...
Well, she had a red nose.

52:37.880 --> 52:41.879
-Oh, she is quite well, thank you, Father.
-Good.

52:52.760 --> 52:55.599
My apologies for calling so unexpectedly

52:55.720 --> 53:00.279
but I could not rest without knowing
that Miss Elliot had not taken cold yesterday.

53:00.360 --> 53:04.599
Oh, how exceedingly kind of you, Mr Elliot.

53:08.200 --> 53:14.879
Ah, my dear sir, give me leave
to present my daughter Anne.

53:20.040 --> 53:22.399
But this is extraordinary.

53:22.520 --> 53:27.279
Our paths have crossed before, Sir Walter,
at LYme not a week past.

53:28.000 --> 53:34.679
-Not that I could expect Miss Elliot to remember.
-Indeed I do remember, Mr Elliot, very clearly.

53:35.120 --> 53:39.159
How extraordinary that we should be guests
at the same inn at the same time.

53:39.760 --> 53:42.839
Yes, it is.

53:43.400 --> 53:47.279
One might almost say...providential.

53:56.400 --> 53:59.519
I cannot tell you how relieved
I am to see her recovering so.

54:00.280 --> 54:04.279
Yes and she will make an excellent wife, Frederick.
I congratulate you.

54:04.440 --> 54:05.919
I beg your pardon?

54:06.000 --> 54:07.679
Come, sir, you're mistaken

54:07.760 --> 54:11.719
if you think you've kept your intentions
towards Louisa Musgrove a secret.

54:13.720 --> 54:17.359
You mean to say you consider an understanding
exists between myself and Miss Musgrove?

54:17.480 --> 54:20.599
-Of course. Do you deny it?
-I do. That is, what you say astonishes me.

54:20.680 --> 54:22.719
Do you mean to tell me
you don't care for her at all?

54:22.800 --> 54:24.479
No, not in that way, no. Rest assured.

54:24.560 --> 54:27.959
Well, then I fear you'll gravely disappoint
both her and her family.

54:28.040 --> 54:30.159
They talk of little else.

54:34.400 --> 54:38.639
Dear God, Harry,
have I been so unguarded, so thoughtless?

54:38.920 --> 54:40.919
It would appear that you have.

54:41.320 --> 54:45.079
Well, if what you say is true then I must,
in all honour, regard myself as bound to her.

54:45.200 --> 54:48.559
Indeed, Frederick.
I am afraid you seem to have entangled yourself.

54:48.640 --> 54:51.039
This is dreadful. What can I do?

54:53.120 --> 54:57.159
Perhaps you might take your leave of LYme
on some pretext,

54:57.600 --> 55:00.439
and await Louisa's recovery elsewhere.

55:00.920 --> 55:05.359
It is perhaps possible a prolonged absence
may weaken the bonds between you.

55:07.200 --> 55:10.879
I have been meaning to visit
my brother in Shropshire.

55:12.160 --> 55:13.799
Capital.

55:36.240 --> 55:41.039
-Captain Wentworth and Louisa Musgrove?
-It's quite true. I assure you.

55:41.120 --> 55:44.319
Any day now I expect to hear news
of the engagement.

55:46.480 --> 55:50.079
And you, child, are you reconciled to it?

55:50.600 --> 55:52.839
Oh, yes, indeed.

55:53.240 --> 55:57.079
-I wish them every happiness.
-Mmm. Of course.

56:09.080 --> 56:13.479
Oh, look, there's our Mr Elliot with the Wallaces.

56:14.800 --> 56:18.119
I must admit he does have
a very pleasant manner.

56:18.200 --> 56:21.999
Indeed he does. And yet...

56:23.040 --> 56:25.079
And yet?

56:25.960 --> 56:29.559
I cannot help feeling that there must be
something more than immediately appears

56:29.680 --> 56:33.679
in this sudden interest in our family,
after so many years.

56:33.760 --> 56:36.319
You refer to Elizabeth, I take it.

56:36.680 --> 56:38.279
She is very handsome.

56:38.360 --> 56:42.119
Well, he has nothing to gain from a reconciliation.

56:42.640 --> 56:48.159
His late wife, however unsuitable a match,
was exceedingly wealthy, and in any case

56:48.640 --> 56:53.519
nothing can prevent him from inheriting Kellynch
and the baronetcy along with it.

56:53.920 --> 56:58.279
Nothing except my father marrying again

56:58.480 --> 57:01.399
and providing himself at last with a male heir.

57:01.480 --> 57:04.079
Ah. No, indeed.

57:04.560 --> 57:09.439
And Mrs Clay is young and altogether well-looking.

57:10.440 --> 57:15.599
I wonder at Elizabeth, to place such a woman
under your father's nose so.

57:16.440 --> 57:17.879
We must be vigilant.

57:18.280 --> 57:22.519
-Ah, Lady Russell.
-Ah, Lady Cavendish.

57:31.520 --> 57:33.319
My dearest cousin,

57:33.560 --> 57:36.919
once again providence seems eager
to throw us together.

57:37.440 --> 57:39.599
Good morning, Mr Elliot.

57:39.760 --> 57:42.879
I confess, I called nearly an hour ago
at Camden Place

57:43.000 --> 57:46.079
and was most distressed to find you absent.

57:47.160 --> 57:51.639
My father was quite taken up with some
sensational news in this morning's paper.

57:52.120 --> 57:53.919
You refer, of course, to your cousins,

57:54.040 --> 57:58.439
the Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple and
her daughter the Honourable Miss Carteret,

57:59.320 --> 58:01.359
who arrive in Bath today.

58:01.440 --> 58:03.559
You are very well informed, Mr Elliot.

58:03.640 --> 58:07.079
Your father may have mentioned
something on the subject.

58:07.760 --> 58:10.039
I do not doubt that he did.

58:12.160 --> 58:15.839
You do not seem anxious
to make their acquaintance again.

58:17.120 --> 58:21.159
I agree.
The Dalrymples are nothing in themselves, but

58:21.520 --> 58:25.199
family connections are always worth preserving.

58:25.280 --> 58:28.719
And they are regarded everywhere
as good company.

58:29.360 --> 58:34.279
My idea of good company, Mr Elliot,
is the company of clever, well-informed people

58:34.600 --> 58:37.319
who have a great deal of conversation.

58:37.560 --> 58:41.039
You are mistaken. That is not good company.

58:41.800 --> 58:44.079
That is the best.

58:44.440 --> 58:48.399
No, good company requires only birth,
manners and education

58:48.480 --> 58:52.999
and, with regard to education,
I'm afraid it is not very particular.

58:55.080 --> 58:58.959
Oh, my cousin Anne shakes her head.
She is not satisfied.

59:00.400 --> 59:05.239
In one point, however, I'm sure we must feel alike.

59:05.800 --> 59:10.719
We welcome any addition to your father's society
which diverts his thoughts from those who,

59:12.760 --> 59:14.879
well, are beneath him.

59:18.000 --> 59:20.239
You refer to Mrs Clay?

59:21.640 --> 59:23.959
It is possible that I do.

59:26.680 --> 59:30.999
My concern is that my father
may be rendered unhappy by the connection.

59:31.800 --> 59:34.239
But perhaps I'm too fastidious.

59:35.200 --> 59:37.399
My dear Anne,

59:37.840 --> 59:42.599
you have a better right to be fastidious
than any woman I've ever met.

59:54.320 --> 59:57.919
Oh, good heavens.

59:58.200 --> 01:00:00.359
Mr Elliot not with you?

01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:04.919
There is a letter come for you from Uppercross.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:09.599
If you are quick you may just have time
to read it before he calls again!

01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:26.199
My dear Anne, I rejoice to tell you
that Louisa improves daily

01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:28.599
and will soon be quite her old self.

01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:31.959
I am also told we shall soon hear
wedding bells at Uppercross,

01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:35.319
although I'm sworn to secrecy
on the subject and may say no more.

01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:39.479
But Mama says the local dressmakers
will not answer for such an occasion.

01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:42.839
So, expect to see us at Bath next week
for a fitting.

01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:46.919
Until then, I remain your affectionate
brother-in-law, Charles Musgrove.

01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:29.799
Anne.

01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:34.519
Anne! Anne!

01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:50.719
Come, come, Anne, we must not be late.

01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:55.399
You cannot have forgotten
we have an invitation from Lady Dalrymple.

01:01:56.800 --> 01:02:00.839
I regret I am already engaged
to spend the evening with an old school friend.

01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:05.239
Not that sickly old widow in Westgate Buildings?

01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:10.239
-Mrs Smith, yes.
-Smith?

01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:14.239
-Westgate Buildings?
-Excuse me.

01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:18.559
And who, pray, is Mrs Smith?

01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:22.639
One of the 5,000 Smiths
that are everywhere to be met with?

01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:26.919
Upon my word, Miss Anne Elliot,
you have the most extraordinary taste.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.439
To place such a person

01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:35.399
ahead of your own family connections
among the nobility of England and Ireland.

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:39.479
Mrs Smith.

01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:45.759
Perhaps she's not the only poor widow in Bath
with little to live on and no surname of dignity.

01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:49.679
Good evening.

01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:08.759
-Anne.
-Harriet.

01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:14.359
-How are you?
-I'm well, thank you. Much better.

01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:16.759
This is my nurse Mrs Rooke.

01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:20.039
-How do you do, Miss Elliot?
-Mrs Rooke.

01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:23.079
I am truly sorry
I've been unable to visit before this.

01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:25.119
My time has not been my own.

01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:30.119
Oh, but we are deeply honoured to have a cousin
of Lady Dalrymple pay us a visit here this evening

01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:34.159
instead of calling upon her relations
with the rest of her family.

01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:39.239
You will soon learn
that absolutely nothing happens in Bath

01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:41.919
without Nurse Rooke hearing of it.

01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:46.599
Come, dearest Anne,

01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:50.959
tell me everything that has happened
to you in the past 12 years.

01:03:52.320 --> 01:04:01.039
Harry!

01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:07.119
Harry! Harry!

01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:09.719
Frederick.

01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:15.239
I called at the inn but Louisa's gone back home
to Uppercross, I find.

01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:19.239
A week ago, at least. Benwick took her.
She's quite recovered.

01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:22.559
How is your brother?

01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:26.279
He thinks I'm as big a fool as I do.

01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:32.999
You have no idea, Harry, how I...
how I curse the folly of my own pride.

01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:35.919
Had I only the good sense to seize my happiness
when I had the chance again

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.399
and none of this would have happened.

01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:39.239
I'm not sure I follow.

01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:43.239
I imagine myself indifferent to her

01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:46.559
but I was only angry and resentful.

01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:49.679
Too late.

01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:53.479
Too late I began to understand myself and her.

01:04:55.040 --> 01:05:00.759
Never, never have I met her equal in good sense
or sweetness of character.

01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:03.999
She's perfection itself.

01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:08.959
I've never loved any but her.

01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:13.799
-We are talking now of Anne Elliot?
-Of course, who else?

01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:17.079
Then I take it
you have not received Benwick's letter.

01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:23.079
I shall have to go to Uppercross now.
It cannot, in all decency, be avoided.

01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:26.639
I mention this letter
only because it contains the news

01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:29.239
that he has proposed to Louisa Musgrove.

01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:34.119
She has accepted him.
They are to be married directly.

01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:35.999
Married?

01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:40.119
-Louisa and Benwick?
-Directly.

01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:45.799
Then... Then I'm free.

01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:50.439
As it happens, I'm going to Bath tomorrow.

01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:53.399
Perhaps now you'd care to join me.

01:05:56.800 --> 01:06:00.239
And whom should I chance to meet
at the Pump Rooms again yesterday

01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:02.839
but Mr Elliot.

01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:06.639
Without being indiscreet,

01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:10.119
I can reveal that you were very much talked of.

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:14.839
He thinks you a most extraordinary young woman.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:18.279
In your temper, manners, mind,

01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:21.159
a model of female excellence.

01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:26.039
Now, I am no matchmaker, as you well know,

01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:31.919
but a most suitable connection.
Everybody must certainly consider it.

01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:36.319
And I do think there would be
every possibility of your

01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:40.719
and Mr Elliot being very happy together.

01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:45.959
And, I must confess,
to look forward and think of you

01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:48.639
occupying your dear mother's place

01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:51.279
as the future mistress of Kellynch.

01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:53.759
The future Lady Elliot.

01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:58.199
Oh, my dearest Anne,
it would give me more delight

01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:01.959
than is often felt at my time of life.

01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:04.639
Lady Russell.

01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:09.719
Will you join us?

01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:18.599
I cannot deny the idea
of being restored to Kellynch,

01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:22.759
of calling it home again, my home forever,

01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:26.439
has a charm I cannot immediately resist.

01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:32.399
And Mr Elliot is an exceedingly agreeable man

01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:37.039
and, in many respects, I think very highly of him.

01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:42.159
Admiral and Mrs Croft
come to call on Miss Anne Elliot.

01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:53.079
Admiral, Mrs Croft, I'm delighted to see you.

01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:55.279
What brings you here to Bath?

01:07:55.480 --> 01:07:58.399
I'm afraid, Miss Elliot, it is my digestion.

01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:01.199
And when your sister Mary learned
we were to come to Bath,

01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:03.239
she charged us with this letter for you.

01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:05.679
Thank you. You must stay for tea.

01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:08.319
And tell me the news from Kellynch.

01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:14.439
Well, all the talk, of course,
has been of the marriage.

01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:19.198
-The marriage?
-Why, your cousin of course.

01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:21.399
Miss Louisa Musgrove.

01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:25.559
Do you mean to tell me you did not know?

01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:28.038
No, indeed.

01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:34.078
I only had a note from Charles
that we were to soon expect a wedding.

01:08:34.319 --> 01:08:39.359
Oh, well, then I'm sure the letter we have brought
from your sister will contain a full account.

01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:43.679
I'm very happy for Louisa.

01:08:44.359 --> 01:08:47.679
- I am certain she has chosen wisely.
- Indeed, indeed.

01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:49.439
Oh, he's a fine fellow,
right enough.

01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:54.759
And whatever Frederick may say,
she has no fears of being a naval captain's wife.

01:08:55.399 --> 01:08:56.759
No, indeed.

01:08:57.359 --> 01:09:00.719
I must confess the news did come
as something of a surprise to us.

01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:02.399
Even Sophy was taken aback.

01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:08.118
Really? Did he give you no indication
of his intentions?

01:09:08.439 --> 01:09:10.679
No. No, never a word on the subject.

01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:14.279
But Frederick is not a man to pine or complain.

01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:18.279
No, he very honourably hoped she will be
very happy with Benwick and there's an end to it.

01:09:18.359 --> 01:09:20.959
In fact, from his manner of speaking
on the subject,

01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:25.038
one would never guess Frederick could have
ever thought of Louisa Musgrove for himself.

01:09:27.279 --> 01:09:28.519
Benwick?

01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:31.118
I beg your pardon?

01:09:34.359 --> 01:09:39.519
Am I, then, to understand
that Louisa is to marry Captain Benwick

01:09:41.359 --> 01:09:42.919
and not Captain Wentworth?

01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:46.839
Yes. Yes, that's it exactly.

01:09:48.319 --> 01:09:52.279
Poor Frederick. Now he will have to
begin all over with somebody else.

01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:58.519
Miss Anne, is something wrong?

01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:03.079
No. No, you astonished me indeed.

01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:04.879
You mean, you did not know?

01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:09.239
The thing is certainly true.
We have it from Frederick himself.

01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:13.599
-Captain Wentworth is in Bath?
-He arrived last night.

01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:16.319
Oh.

01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:49.439
Captain Wentworth.

01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:54.719
Miss Elliot.

01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:06.199
Your sister mentioned your being in Bath.

01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:10.359
Yes, I'm lodging with the Admiral
in Queen's Square.

01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:20.399
You've perhaps also heard that Louisa Musgrove
is to marryJames Benwick.

01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:24.799
-I have. I was most astonished.
-As was I.

01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:33.719
And yet, I'm sure in time
they will grow more alike.

01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:40.599
Captain Benwick will gain high spirits
and cheerfulness and she will...

01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:42.639
Relish for morbid poetry.

01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:45.959
Just so.

01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:58.439
With all my soul, I wish them happy,

01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:00.719
and yet...

01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:05.039
Miss Louisa is a very

01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:09.479
good, amiable, sweet-tempered girl.

01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:15.399
Harville's sister was a very superior woman,

01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:20.599
and Benwick's attachment to her
was, indeed, profound.

01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:25.879
A man cannot recover from such a passion

01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:29.759
with such a woman.

01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:35.159
He ought not.

01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:43.279
He does not.

01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:52.559
My dear Anne, I cannot say how grieved I am
to have kept you waiting,

01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:55.519
but the carriage is outside.

01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:59.799
Mr Elliot, permit me to name Captain Wentworth.

01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:01.999
My cousin Mr Elliot.

01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:09.959
May I?

01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:16.559
Captain, there is a concert
at the Pump Rooms tonight.

01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:19.199
I remember how fond you are of music.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:41.239
I must say, though, the worst of Bath
is the number of plain women.

01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:47.359
I frequently observe that one pretty face
would be followed by five and thirty frights.

01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:49.239
And as for the men...

01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:50.759
Oh!

01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:53.999
Ah, Lady Russell.

01:13:56.480 --> 01:14:00.079
We are at home tomorrow night
to a somewhat select gathering...

01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:04.039
-We do so hope you are at liberty.
-Of course, Sir Walter, with pleasure.

01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:06.279
But where is Lady Dalrymple?

01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:10.599
Good heavens, is that Frederick Wentworth?

01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:13.479
Isn't he the nobody?

01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:15.839
What on earth is he doing in Bath?

01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:27.919
Captain Wentworth,

01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:32.679
is the programme to your liking?

01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:35.519
I found myself at liberty this evening.

01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:41.639
Bath has much to offer
those who are interested in music.

01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:43.319
So I'm led to believe.

01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:51.319
And shall you be staying long in Bath?

01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:55.399
I don't know.

01:14:56.760 --> 01:14:59.159
That is to say, I am not certain.

01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:01.639
It all depends.

01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:04.239
I see.

01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:09.599
-Miss Elliot...
-Captain.

01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:13.079
Lady Dalrymple.

01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:17.159
Anne, Anne, Lady Dalrymple is here.

01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:10.319
There'll soon be another marriage in that family,
if I'm any judge.

01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:12.559
Certainly, if the rumours are to be believed.

01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:49.519
Captain.

01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:56.759
-Are you going?
-Yes.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.759
Is the first half, at least, not worth staying for?

01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:04.359
No.

01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:08.079
There's nothing here worth me staying for.
Good night.

01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:15.359
My dear Anne, is all well?

01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:19.079
We are all so dreadfully concerned.

01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:22.639
Yes.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:25.919
I felt suddenly a little faint.

01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:28.879
But I'm quite recovered.

01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:36.119
Should we not return to the concert?

01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:39.839
Dearest Anne,

01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:46.079
I have been awaiting an opportunity
to speak to you privately

01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:49.759
and now it seems to have come.

01:17:51.240 --> 01:17:55.159
-I'm sorry, sir, I'm not very good company.
-My dear cousin,

01:17:56.320 --> 01:17:59.119
you are far too modest for the world
in general to be aware

01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:02.239
-of even half your accomplishments.
-Really, sir,

01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:05.919
-I do not think you know me that well.
-On the contrary.

01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:12.719
The name of Anne Elliot has long had
a beguiling charm for me.

01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:18.119
If I dared, I would now breathe my sincerest wish

01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:20.799
that name might never change.

01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:24.839
-Sir...
-I do not venture

01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:27.759
to expect an immediate answer to my proposal.

01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:32.359
But I cannot, in honour,
further conceal my intentions

01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:37.079
and perhaps tomorrow night at Camden Place

01:18:37.960 --> 01:18:40.079
you will feel able to make me

01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:45.679
the happiest and most fortunate of men.

01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:11.679
Miss Elliot, I am charged
with an urgent commission from the Admiral

01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:13.479
in regard to your family.

01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:16.399
And since I am to leave Bath today without delay,

01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:20.119
I should be obliged if I could
wait upon you at 11:00 this morning.

01:19:37.960 --> 01:19:39.359
Hello, Anne, how are you?

01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:41.599
Charles, Mary.

01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:46.279
I am here to take the waters.

01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:50.399
I have been most dreadfully unwell,
it is my last hope.

01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:52.399
Father, Elizabeth.

01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:54.079
Good heavens, it's Mary.

01:19:54.160 --> 01:19:57.359
Sir Walter, Elizabeth, we have come
to choose a wedding dress

01:19:57.440 --> 01:19:59.999
with mother and Henrietta.
She is to be married to Charles Hayter.

01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:01.999
-Who?
-A mere country curate.

01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:05.679
-Father, pray, do not trouble yourself.
-And dear Louisa, is she not with you?

01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:07.559
She stayed at Uppercross with Captain Benwick.

01:20:07.640 --> 01:20:09.319
-Who?
-The naval captain, Father.

01:20:09.400 --> 01:20:10.679
Pray, do not trouble yourself.

01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:13.239
I suppose we shall have to invite
the Musgroves tonight as well.

01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:14.439
A party?

01:20:14.520 --> 01:20:16.919
I shall be loathe
to introduce them to Lady Dalrymple.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:20.679
Will Mr Elliot be there? I must at all costs
be introduced to Mr Elliot.

01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:24.159
Well, I have not the smallest intention
of inviting him, but...

01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:25.439
Wentworth.

01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:27.799
-Charles.
-Hello, old fellow, how are you?

01:20:27.880 --> 01:20:29.319
I didn't expect to see you here.

01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:32.679
Where are you staying?
We must go shooting one day, if you have time.

01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:34.919
-Mrs Musgrove.
-Captain.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:36.999
Father, this is Captain Wentworth.

01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:39.839
He is related to our tenants, the Crofts.

01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:44.079
Captain, this is my father,
Sir Walter Elliot, baronet.

01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:47.399
Yes and my eldest sister Elizabeth.

01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:53.119
-Thank you, we are acquainted.
-Captain, please.

01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:01.599
Well.

01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:08.319
I am charged.

01:21:08.760 --> 01:21:12.999
That is to say the Admiral,
Admiral Croft, has been confidently informed...

01:21:15.440 --> 01:21:16.559
that Mr Elliot...

01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:24.799
That everything is settled now in your family
for a union between yourself and Mr Elliot.

01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:30.479
It was added that you were to live at Kellynch,

01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:34.639
and my commission from the Admiral is
to say that, if the family's wish is such,

01:21:36.920 --> 01:21:38.999
his lease at Kellynch shall be cancelled

01:21:39.080 --> 01:21:42.519
and he and my sister will provide themselves
with another home. That is all.

01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:48.279
What answer shall I give?

01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:54.599
Sir...

01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:03.239
You will please thank the Admiral on my behalf,

01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:09.439
but I must tell you that he is utterly misinformed.

01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:14.639
Misinformed?

01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:19.519
-Utterly?
-Yes, Captain.

01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:21.959
Quite mistaken.

01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:31.679
-No truth in any part of it?
-None.

01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:37.919
And I should be grateful to know
the source of such fanciful rumours.

01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:40.559
As to that...

01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:43.839
Lady Russell is here.

01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:50.759
Do you remember Lady Russell, Captain?

01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:53.799
How could I forget?

01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:55.639
Anne, I received your note.

01:22:57.360 --> 01:23:01.079
Miss Elliot, if you'll excuse me
I shall convey your news to the Admiral.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.519
-Good day.
-Captain.

01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:08.279
Is it true? Mr Elliot has proposed?

01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:11.879
If you'll excuse me, Lady Russell,
I must speak with Captain Wentworth.

01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:16.479
Captain Wentworth.

01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:18.279
Mrs Musgrove.

01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:20.839
Anne.

01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:23.079
What a delight.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:25.119
Excuse me.

01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:36.799
Anne, I must speak with you.

01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:38.959
Must it be now?

01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:42.839
Anne, I must ask.
Is it true Mr Elliot has asked you to marry him?

01:23:42.920 --> 01:23:45.119
-Yes, but...
-Anne, I hope I give no offence,

01:23:45.240 --> 01:23:49.439
but I can never forgive myself if I did not
acquaint you with Mr Elliot's real character.

01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:53.239
-I only hope I'm not too late.
-Good heavens, Harriet, what is it?

01:23:53.360 --> 01:23:56.679
Mr Elliot is a man without heart or conscience.

01:23:57.080 --> 01:24:00.599
A designing, cold-blooded being
who thinks only of itself.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:04.119
His recent reconciliation with your father
was no accident.

01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:06.759
He had heard a rumour in London
that Sir Walter Elliot

01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:09.439
might be led to marry his daughter's companion.

01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:11.239
-Mrs Clay?
-The very same.

01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:14.079
And should she provide him
with an heir, of course,

01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:17.279
the child would inherit everything,
instead of Mr Elliot.

01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:20.559
-But he is already rich.
-Of course.

01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:23.679
He married his poor wife for money
and nothing else.

01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:27.319
But what he now desires above all
is to be a baronet.

01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:30.759
He cannot bear the thought
of not being Sir William.

01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:33.719
Well, why, then, would he wish to marry me?

01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:37.159
Oh, his admiration for you is sincere,
as far as it goes.

01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:42.039
Although it has not prevented him
from courting Mrs Clay at the same time.

01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:45.319
-No.
-Indeed.

01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:48.479
He has promised to establish her
as his mistress in London,

01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:50.639
as soon as he is married to you.

01:24:52.200 --> 01:24:55.599
There is nothing he would not do
to prevent your father marrying again.

01:24:58.600 --> 01:25:01.199
I am profoundly grateful to you, Harriet.

01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:04.519
But now if you'll forgive me, I must go.

01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:27.359
-Captain Harville.
-Miss Elliot.

01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:32.519
If you have come to call upon the Admiral
and Mrs Croft, I must disappoint you.

01:25:32.640 --> 01:25:34.959
They went to take the waters
with Captain Wentworth.

01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:38.799
But since you are here,
you may save me some time.

01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:42.639
Captain Wentworth bade me bring
this note to you in Camden Place.

01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:44.319
Perhaps you would take it now.

01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:48.279
-Thank you.
-Are you quite well, Miss Elliot?

01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:50.519
Thank you.

01:25:51.080 --> 01:25:53.999
Then if you'll excuse me,
I'm already late for an appointment.

01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:17.119
Miss Elliot,
I can bear this no longer.

01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:22.199
You pierced my soul. I'm half agony, half hope.

01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:25.119
Unjust I may have been,

01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:28.599
weak and resentful I have been,
but never inconstant.

01:26:29.800 --> 01:26:33.479
I offer myself to you again
with a heart even more your own

01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:35.719
than when you almost broke it eight years ago.

01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:38.839
I have loved none but you.

01:26:39.880 --> 01:26:41.999
You alone, who brought me to Bath,

01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:44.719
for you alone, I think and plan.

01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:47.679
Have you not seen this?

01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:50.599
I can hardly write.

01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:53.919
I must go, uncertain of my fate.

01:26:54.920 --> 01:26:58.319
A word, a look, would be enough.

01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:02.119
Only tell me that I am...

01:27:04.600 --> 01:27:06.719
Tell me not that I am too late,

01:27:07.720 --> 01:27:10.439
that such precious feelings are gone forever.

01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:16.599
Why, Miss Elliot, you just missed Frederick.

01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:19.559
He has just gone to call upon you
at Camden Place.

01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:52.079
Anne!

01:27:52.240 --> 01:27:54.839
-Charles!
-Anne, good heavens, is anything the matter?

01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:56.839
Anne.

01:27:56.960 --> 01:28:00.279
Thank you, Charles, I'm quite...quite well.

01:28:00.360 --> 01:28:03.399
You look quite done for.
We shall have to get you home directly.

01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:07.399
The thing of it is, I ought to be
in the marketplace now.

01:28:08.040 --> 01:28:11.239
A fellow there promised me the sight
of a capital gun he's just sending off.

01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:14.159
Said he'd keep it unpacked
till the last possible minute.

01:28:14.600 --> 01:28:16.719
If I do not cut along now I shall miss out.

01:28:18.160 --> 01:28:19.879
You know from his description, Wentworth,

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:24.119
it sounds a good deal like that 16-bore Mortimer
of mine you shot with that day round Winthrop.

01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:25.479
Do you remember?

01:28:43.480 --> 01:28:44.719
Captain...

01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:46.439
Captain,

01:28:48.040 --> 01:28:52.559
I am...I am in receipt of your proposal

01:28:53.840 --> 01:28:55.839
and am minded to accept it.

01:28:57.640 --> 01:28:58.959
Thank you.

01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:02.279
Are you

01:29:05.080 --> 01:29:06.399
quite certain?

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:08.319
I am.

01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:10.639
I am determined.

01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:12.839
I will.

01:29:13.960 --> 01:29:19.199
And nothing, you may be sure,
will ever persuade me otherwise.

01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:22.879
Why have we stopped?

01:30:24.520 --> 01:30:25.799
You can't see?

01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:34.919
Give me your hand.

01:31:00.440 --> 01:31:04.719
I thought you might like to see
your wedding present.
