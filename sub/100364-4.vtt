00:00.493 --> 00:02.044
Do you, Rosa Alvarez,

00:02.113 --> 00:05.665
take Cooper Roback to be
your lawfully wedded husband?

00:05.734 --> 00:07.355
I do.

00:07.424 --> 00:09.148
And do you, Cooper Roback,

00:09.217 --> 00:12.251
take Rosa Alvarez to be
your lawfully wedded wife?

00:12.320 --> 00:13.803
I do.

00:13.872 --> 00:15.975
By the power vested in me

00:16.044 --> 00:18.148
by the great state of Montana,

00:18.217 --> 00:20.941
I now pronounce you, by proxy,

00:21.010 --> 00:23.044
to be man and wife.

00:25.010 --> 00:26.320
Hey, what are you waiting on?

00:26.389 --> 00:28.251
You may kiss the bride.

00:28.320 --> 00:29.803
Come on, now, kiss your beloved.

00:29.872 --> 00:31.355
Smooch her.

00:31.424 --> 00:33.113
And thank you for your service.

00:33.182 --> 00:35.596
I can't tell you what it means
to all of us back here in...

00:35.665 --> 00:37.424
Yeah, bye-bye.

00:37.493 --> 00:38.631
Now that we're married,

00:38.700 --> 00:40.251
we have a mountain of paperwork,

00:40.320 --> 00:41.768
an interview at Bagram,

00:41.837 --> 00:43.388
and who knows what else to do
before I get my green card.

00:43.389 --> 00:44.596
Okay, just hold on.

00:44.665 --> 00:46.345
Let's just take a breath
and let the weight

00:46.414 --> 00:48.241
of this momentous
occasion sink in, okay?

00:50.527 --> 00:52.167
- What?
- You realize once we're divorced,

00:52.217 --> 00:54.257
I'm always gonna have to
refer to you as my ex-wife.

00:54.326 --> 00:56.726
And I'm always gonna have to
refer to you as my ex-husband.

00:58.389 --> 00:59.631
Damn it.

00:59.700 --> 01:01.260
I didn't even get you to sign a prenup.

01:01.286 --> 01:02.527
When we get divorced,

01:02.596 --> 01:04.010
you can take me for all I'm worth.

01:04.078 --> 01:06.044
How much are you worth?

01:06.113 --> 01:07.837
Nothing. You?

01:07.906 --> 01:09.320
Less than nothing.

01:12.562 --> 01:14.079
What do you think?

01:14.148 --> 01:15.872
Spent artillery.

01:15.941 --> 01:19.182
Exactly what every couple wants
to celebrate their marriage.

01:26.044 --> 01:27.941
Your carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Roback.

01:28.010 --> 01:29.700
Never call me that again.

01:29.768 --> 01:30.944
Come on, we got to do it.

01:31.013 --> 01:32.044
This is dumb.

01:32.113 --> 01:33.393
It's for the immigration board.

02:11.835 --> 02:13.835
Here comes the bride.

02:15.942 --> 02:17.560
Here they come.

02:17.562 --> 02:18.975
Come here.

02:19.044 --> 02:20.589
Come on.

02:21.058 --> 02:23.148
Smile.

02:23.217 --> 02:24.355
Are we done?

02:24.424 --> 02:26.182
One more for all the
relatives back home.

02:26.251 --> 02:28.079
You're enjoying this?

02:28.148 --> 02:29.424
Yeah, why not?

02:29.493 --> 02:30.803
It's fun. Admit it.

02:32.044 --> 02:33.906
So what's next for the happy couple?

02:37.493 --> 02:38.906
Gonna roll you over, Soldier.

02:38.975 --> 02:40.217
One, two, three.

02:48.700 --> 02:50.182
All right, back! Get back!

02:50.251 --> 02:52.286
- Where are you from?
- Louisville, sir.

02:52.355 --> 02:54.182
Christ, that hurts.

02:54.251 --> 02:55.651
I'm sure it does, but don't worry.

02:55.720 --> 02:57.000
We're gonna get you out of here.

02:57.001 --> 02:58.010
How bad is it?

02:58.079 --> 02:59.129
You're gonna be fine.

02:59.179 --> 03:00.251
I can't feel my legs.

03:00.320 --> 03:01.720
It's just the adrenaline. Lie back.

03:01.721 --> 03:03.182
Where are my fucking legs?

03:03.251 --> 03:04.665
- Sit back.
- Don't worry.

03:04.734 --> 03:05.975
We're gonna take care of you.

03:10.734 --> 03:13.010
Three, two, one.

03:27.872 --> 03:29.975
Move it! Move it!

03:34.355 --> 03:36.493
I want my fucking legs back.

03:36.562 --> 03:37.700
Just hang in there, buddy.

03:37.768 --> 03:39.328
I don't want to fucking hang in there.

03:39.397 --> 03:40.466
It's gonna be okay.

03:40.535 --> 03:41.872
It's not gonna be okay.

03:41.941 --> 03:43.493
I want to fucking die.

03:43.562 --> 03:45.113
No, you don't.

03:52.631 --> 03:54.424
My side pocket. There's a letter.

03:54.493 --> 03:56.631
When I die, mail it.

03:56.700 --> 03:58.113
Buddy, you're gonna make it.

03:58.182 --> 04:00.251
It's for my wife.

04:08.251 --> 04:10.182
Please. Do it.

04:12.596 --> 04:14.424
Okay, I got it. I got it, okay?

04:14.493 --> 04:15.596
I got it.

04:15.665 --> 04:18.079
Never get used to this part of the job.

04:18.148 --> 04:20.182
If you did,

04:20.250 --> 04:22.043
you wouldn't be any good at it.

04:23.665 --> 04:26.079
Let's get this guy to a doctor.

04:44.768 --> 04:46.010
What have we got here?

04:46.079 --> 04:47.599
Bilateral above-the-knee amputations.

04:47.600 --> 04:48.603
Tourniquets applied.

04:48.672 --> 04:50.385
Let's get our friend here
prepped for surgery.

04:50.386 --> 04:52.148
- Sì, Captain.
- I want an American doctor.

04:52.217 --> 04:54.498
Ah, well, we're all out of
American doctors at the moment.

04:54.499 --> 04:56.699
But I'd like to recommend a
fine chap from North London.

04:56.706 --> 04:58.113
- Me.
- Don't look English.

04:58.182 --> 04:59.562
I'll take that as a compliment.

04:59.609 --> 05:01.009
All right, let's get him monitored,

05:01.010 --> 05:02.210
draw labs, and for God's sake,

05:02.239 --> 05:03.679
get him out of these bloody clothes.

05:03.680 --> 05:05.740
- Subito.
- Wait.

05:05.768 --> 05:07.848
Look, my job was just to
get you here, Louie, okay?

05:07.877 --> 05:09.917
You're with Dr. Hazara now.
He's the best surgeon...

05:09.918 --> 05:12.182
The letter... mail it to my wife?

05:12.251 --> 05:14.286
- Promise me.
- I don't have to promise you,

05:14.355 --> 05:16.113
'cause you're gonna make it, okay?

05:28.044 --> 05:29.182
Promise.

05:44.355 --> 05:45.389
Approaching.

05:45.458 --> 05:48.631
Halt! State your business!

05:48.700 --> 05:50.941
We are Afghan National Army.

05:51.010 --> 05:52.768
Do you believe them?

05:52.837 --> 05:54.113
ANA have uniforms.

05:54.182 --> 05:56.941
Do you have identification?

05:58.389 --> 06:00.286
Do you see identification?

06:00.355 --> 06:02.906
- No ID.
- No shit.

06:02.975 --> 06:04.837
Why are you naked?

06:04.906 --> 06:06.044
Taliban.

06:06.113 --> 06:08.079
They take our uniforms and our guns.

06:08.148 --> 06:11.389
Okay, what do we do?

06:11.458 --> 06:13.493
We can't just leave them
out there like that.

06:13.562 --> 06:15.482
They could have bombs
implanted inside of them.

06:15.483 --> 06:17.966
Let's not start that shit again.

06:26.355 --> 06:27.700
You want to let them on?

06:27.768 --> 06:29.182
You got to search them.

06:29.251 --> 06:31.596
That means anyplace they
could be hiding something.

06:31.665 --> 06:32.872
Aw, man.

06:32.941 --> 06:34.389
Sucks being Petrocelli.

06:34.458 --> 06:36.424
Go, take it.

06:36.493 --> 06:38.941
Okay.

06:48.634 --> 06:49.665
Sweet.

07:11.562 --> 07:13.148
Our own bathroom?

07:13.217 --> 07:15.389
Should've made an honest
woman out of you months ago.

07:16.596 --> 07:18.079
Okay.

07:18.148 --> 07:19.803
- Ground rules.
- Yeah?

07:19.872 --> 07:21.596
Clean up after yourself.

07:21.665 --> 07:23.700
And we're not sleeping in one bed.

07:25.493 --> 07:27.631
Relax. It's the army.

07:49.251 --> 07:50.872
Oh, man.

07:53.813 --> 07:55.561
I was thinking about
having some of the guys

07:55.562 --> 07:57.362
from the office over
a little later for poker.

07:57.363 --> 07:59.527
You mind fixing us some
refreshments and snacks?

07:59.596 --> 08:02.044
No time for naps.

08:02.113 --> 08:03.665
The sooner we fill these out,

08:03.734 --> 08:06.079
the sooner we get to
Bagram to finalize this

08:06.148 --> 08:07.508
and the less time we have to worry

08:07.537 --> 08:08.737
about getting court-martialed.

08:08.738 --> 08:10.044
Look,

08:10.113 --> 08:12.273
I'm ready, willing, and able
to spend hours filling out

08:12.274 --> 08:15.113
this endless stack of
coma-inducing government forms.

08:15.182 --> 08:17.941
But after tonight's dustoff,

08:18.010 --> 08:20.044
I need to decompress, okay?

08:24.044 --> 08:25.320
One more ground rule.

08:25.389 --> 08:27.148
Okay.

08:27.217 --> 08:28.700
No jerking off.

08:30.562 --> 08:32.565
That's gonna be tough.

08:33.192 --> 08:35.111
What are you gonna do if
you have to rub one out?

08:35.113 --> 08:36.217
None of your business.

08:36.285 --> 08:38.320
But I can promise you
that whatever it is,

08:38.389 --> 08:39.562
you will not hear a thing.

08:41.044 --> 08:43.355
Catholic girls are all the same.

08:54.589 --> 08:55.620
Thanks.

08:58.451 --> 09:00.141
Heard about you and Alvarez.

09:00.210 --> 09:01.486
Thanks, man.

09:01.555 --> 09:03.037
We're registered at the PX.

09:03.106 --> 09:04.727
Got to admit, I always thought

09:04.796 --> 09:07.196
you and Davis would be the ones
who'd end up getting married.

09:07.244 --> 09:08.451
Oh, I get it.

09:08.520 --> 09:10.175
'Cause we're both guys, right?

09:11.279 --> 09:13.451
How about you give back
what you took from us?

09:13.520 --> 09:15.141
Look, told you.

09:15.210 --> 09:17.530
Fight the Warlord's bodyguard,
I'll give you what you want.

09:17.531 --> 09:19.589
How about you give me
what I want, then I fight?

09:19.658 --> 09:20.693
I like my way better.

09:20.762 --> 09:21.882
You're messing with things

09:21.934 --> 09:24.451
way above your pay grade, Roback.

09:24.520 --> 09:27.037
Look, follow my logic.

09:27.106 --> 09:28.244
The base wants good fights,

09:28.313 --> 09:29.864
and good fights need
fighters who are hungry.

09:29.865 --> 09:31.665
If I give you what you
want, you're satisfied.

09:31.666 --> 09:33.045
And if I don't, you're hungry.

09:34.796 --> 09:36.210
You need me to say it again slower?

09:37.486 --> 09:38.865
You don't have it, do you?

09:40.279 --> 09:42.210
Let's just put it this way.

09:42.279 --> 09:43.865
- I do.
- You're lying.

09:43.934 --> 09:45.831
I never lie on Tuesdays.

09:45.900 --> 09:47.831
You tell me where the Blue FOB is,

09:47.900 --> 09:48.931
I fight your guy.

09:52.382 --> 09:53.865
Blue FOB?

10:05.175 --> 10:06.796
Can I help you?

10:06.865 --> 10:07.968
I'm just looking.

10:08.037 --> 10:09.486
For what?

10:11.589 --> 10:13.968
Any of these FOBs ever get
referred to as the Blue FOB?

10:14.037 --> 10:16.520
Mm, not to my knowledge.

10:23.106 --> 10:24.417
Hmm.

10:27.451 --> 10:28.900
What do you see in Sasquatch?

10:28.968 --> 10:30.728
The fact he doesn't drop
his ass on my desk

10:30.796 --> 10:32.348
while I'm trying to work is a start.

10:32.417 --> 10:34.313
That's not enough to
sustain a relationship.

10:34.382 --> 10:37.037
But I'm sure it'll suffice
until your ETS is up

10:37.106 --> 10:38.486
and you ditch his ass for LA.

10:38.555 --> 10:39.693
He's coming with me.

10:39.762 --> 10:41.322
He already has a security job lined up.

10:41.382 --> 10:42.727
In the mall or the airport?

10:42.796 --> 10:45.968
Personal security. Pays six figures.

10:46.037 --> 10:47.451
Well, when did this happen?

10:47.520 --> 10:49.072
Why do you care?

10:49.141 --> 10:51.261
I just didn't think you were
that serious about him.

10:51.262 --> 10:53.762
You thought wrong.

10:53.831 --> 10:56.003
No, this doesn't work for me.

10:56.072 --> 10:57.792
I was planning a long
and intricate campaign

10:57.793 --> 10:58.934
to get you back,

10:59.003 --> 11:00.451
which includes wearing you down

11:00.520 --> 11:02.210
with constant badgering
until you realized

11:02.279 --> 11:04.519
that my intentions were true
and that we belong together.

11:04.588 --> 11:05.864
Let me save you some time.

11:05.933 --> 11:08.072
Does this have anything
to do with Alvarez?

11:08.141 --> 11:09.382
You are married to her.

11:09.451 --> 11:11.451
No, I mean the fact that
you two are now besties.

11:11.452 --> 11:12.544
What about it?

11:12.613 --> 11:14.210
You're trying to protect her.

11:14.279 --> 11:15.919
She's not the reason I'm with Sasquatch.

11:15.920 --> 11:17.230
Then what is?

11:18.382 --> 11:20.244
Apparently you need to hear this,

11:20.313 --> 11:21.451
so I'm gonna say it.

11:23.934 --> 11:25.762
- I'm in love with him.
- I don't believe you.

11:25.831 --> 11:27.762
You obviously know more
about what I'm feeling

11:27.831 --> 11:29.003
than I do, Dr. Roback.

11:29.072 --> 11:30.420
But let's pick this up
in our next session.

11:30.421 --> 11:32.261
Right now, you need to
get the hell out of here

11:32.262 --> 11:34.144
before Colonel Austin
gets back from lunch.

11:47.658 --> 11:49.451
"Macaroni and cheese".

11:49.520 --> 11:51.210
Glad to see your appetite has returned.

11:51.279 --> 11:52.486
Mm-hmm.

11:52.555 --> 11:54.313
Just saw your latest test results.

11:54.382 --> 11:56.279
Your numbers are right
where they need to be.

11:56.348 --> 11:57.693
So we can leave?

11:57.762 --> 11:58.934
You can leave.

11:59.003 --> 12:00.313
Thank you.

12:00.382 --> 12:02.796
We have much work to do in our village.

12:02.865 --> 12:03.900
We have a school.

12:03.968 --> 12:05.288
Well, I thought it's been closed

12:05.357 --> 12:06.597
since your parents were killed.

12:06.598 --> 12:08.003
We plan to reopen it.

12:08.072 --> 12:10.106
But the people who killed your parents

12:10.175 --> 12:11.589
are still out there,

12:11.658 --> 12:13.036
and I'm guessing they haven't
had a change of heart

12:13.037 --> 12:14.934
on the subject of educating women.

12:15.003 --> 12:17.417
Every member of our
village that we educate

12:17.486 --> 12:19.451
will pass that knowledge to their family

12:19.520 --> 12:21.003
and their family after that.

12:21.072 --> 12:22.693
That is our legacy.

12:22.762 --> 12:24.141
I can see you're both determined

12:24.210 --> 12:26.003
to put yourselves in harm's way,

12:26.072 --> 12:29.279
so all I can offer you
is a very useless...

12:29.348 --> 12:31.693
good luck.

12:31.762 --> 12:36.244
Thank you again for saving my life.

12:38.003 --> 12:40.348
Yeah, well...

12:40.417 --> 12:41.796
hope it was worth it.

12:45.934 --> 12:47.037
What the hell, Roback?

12:47.106 --> 12:48.968
What? I didn't do anything.

12:49.037 --> 12:50.451
I know.

12:50.520 --> 12:53.486
We're supposed to be supply
checking the Black Hawk.

12:54.624 --> 12:55.831
I'm sorry. I forgot.

12:55.900 --> 12:57.865
Guess you forgot to clean up too.

12:57.934 --> 12:59.175
I'm getting to it.

13:04.934 --> 13:06.141
What's wrong?

13:07.348 --> 13:10.003
Durkin's in love with Sasquatch.

13:10.072 --> 13:11.348
How do you know?

13:11.417 --> 13:12.831
She told me.

13:14.279 --> 13:16.279
You really dig her.

13:16.348 --> 13:17.693
I must.

13:17.762 --> 13:20.072
My head is way fucked up right now.

13:21.210 --> 13:22.520
Poor baby.

13:22.589 --> 13:24.934
I mean, you guys talk, right?

13:25.003 --> 13:26.968
Have I got any shot
at turning this around?

13:27.037 --> 13:28.831
- No.
- You want to take a moment?

13:28.900 --> 13:30.580
Really think about it
before you answer me?

13:30.589 --> 13:32.555
She's sort of done with you.

13:33.900 --> 13:35.175
Ouch.

13:35.244 --> 13:37.727
You want the truth, don't you?

13:37.796 --> 13:39.796
Not really.

13:39.865 --> 13:41.486
I would.

13:41.555 --> 13:43.796
Yeah, but you're made of
much sterner stuff than I am.

13:47.003 --> 13:48.279
Okay.

13:48.348 --> 13:51.417
Watching you sit around
heartbroken and lovesick

13:51.486 --> 13:53.348
is not a lot of fun.

13:53.417 --> 13:54.658
You're not good at it.

13:54.727 --> 13:56.486
Some people are, but you're not.

13:56.555 --> 13:57.968
So do me a favor.

13:58.037 --> 13:59.313
Get over her

13:59.382 --> 14:01.555
and pick up your gross,
disgusting clothes.

14:04.963 --> 14:06.523
You still haven't filled out the forms?

14:06.524 --> 14:07.589
Look, I...

14:07.658 --> 14:08.762
We cannot schedule Bagram

14:08.831 --> 14:10.003
until we send them in.

14:10.072 --> 14:12.865
I will, okay? I promise.

14:14.313 --> 14:16.279
Sasquatch would have
filled them out by now.

14:16.348 --> 14:17.555
That's a low blow.

14:17.624 --> 14:20.417
Then fill them the fuck out.

14:37.417 --> 14:38.865
Tell the Warlord

14:38.934 --> 14:41.382
I need to take his
bodyguard back to the base

14:41.451 --> 14:43.141
to show my promoter he's for real.

14:46.865 --> 14:48.417
He says no fight.

14:48.486 --> 14:50.072
What? We have a deal.

14:52.072 --> 14:53.592
He says the game is boring. Too easy.

14:53.593 --> 14:55.348
Lucky for him, I'm a problem solver.

14:55.417 --> 14:57.831
Let me take the handheld
back to the base.

14:57.900 --> 15:00.382
I'll load it up with all the
new games it could handle,

15:00.451 --> 15:01.486
bring it back to him.

15:01.555 --> 15:03.727
This is it.

15:05.658 --> 15:08.037
Tell him he can make
himself comfortable.

15:08.106 --> 15:09.968
He can use all the equipment.

15:11.555 --> 15:13.831
It's gonna take a while
to download these games.

15:44.727 --> 15:45.968
Get it, man.

15:46.037 --> 15:47.520
Show everybody what you got.

15:49.624 --> 15:50.865
Y'all see this?

15:50.934 --> 15:52.693
Ha!

15:52.762 --> 15:54.796
That's it.

15:56.348 --> 15:57.796
Yo, SecCorp,

15:57.865 --> 15:59.313
go tell Sasquatch

15:59.382 --> 16:01.693
this man is gonna whup his ass.

16:10.796 --> 16:12.037
At ease.

16:15.348 --> 16:18.417
Apparently our good friends
at SecCorp ran a full convoy

16:18.486 --> 16:20.846
of equipment through a friendly
LN's poppy field last night,

16:20.847 --> 16:22.072
destroying half his crop.

16:22.141 --> 16:24.003
The locals can't tell the difference

16:24.072 --> 16:26.520
between a SecCorp
contractor and U.S. Army.

16:26.589 --> 16:28.389
We'll soon be able to
drop the word "friendly"

16:28.458 --> 16:29.838
when referring to any and all LNs.

16:29.907 --> 16:31.072
Sir.

16:31.141 --> 16:33.261
What the hell are those
contractors doing here anyway?

16:33.262 --> 16:34.693
That's above my pay grade.

16:34.762 --> 16:36.762
And despite clear evidence that SecCorp

16:36.831 --> 16:38.175
is undermining our mission

16:38.244 --> 16:40.284
to win the hearts and minds
of the local population,

16:40.353 --> 16:41.993
my requests to have
them removed from base

16:42.043 --> 16:43.382
have again been denied.

16:43.451 --> 16:45.589
Okay. Give me what you got.

16:45.658 --> 16:46.762
Captain.

16:46.831 --> 16:49.244
Sir, regarding our naked visitors,

16:49.313 --> 16:50.796
identities have been confirmed.

16:50.865 --> 16:52.244
They all checked out as ANA.

16:52.313 --> 16:53.727
MPs are investigating,

16:53.796 --> 16:55.836
but no signs of their uniforms
or weapons as of yet.

16:55.837 --> 16:56.893
Copy.

16:56.962 --> 16:58.348
Contact local ANA squadrons

16:58.417 --> 17:00.003
and order an immediate stand-down.

17:00.072 --> 17:01.796
I want all friendlies off the street

17:01.865 --> 17:03.624
while our guys are out searching.

17:03.693 --> 17:05.624
And until we can account
for the stolen property,

17:05.693 --> 17:08.762
alert Gate Patrol that any ANA
uniform should be challenged.

17:08.830 --> 17:09.830
Roger that, sir.

17:09.865 --> 17:11.624
Moving on. Anybody else?

17:14.066 --> 17:15.465
Then if you're all out of bad news,

17:15.467 --> 17:17.589
it's time I call home,
get some from my wife.

17:17.657 --> 17:19.106
Carry on.

17:20.657 --> 17:22.313
Sir, sorry I'm late.

17:22.382 --> 17:25.037
I was waiting on a casualty report.

17:27.900 --> 17:30.934
Looks like I'm not gonna
call my wife after all.

17:31.003 --> 17:32.658
Activate River City.

17:32.727 --> 17:34.417
Full communications shutdown

17:34.486 --> 17:36.555
until the fallen soldier's
family can be notified.

17:36.624 --> 17:38.072
Yes, sir.

17:38.141 --> 17:40.181
My wife didn't really want
to hear from me anyway.

17:50.727 --> 17:52.348
Mama...

18:03.106 --> 18:04.693
Mama.

18:06.072 --> 18:07.658
Mama! Ma.

18:07.727 --> 18:09.727
What?

18:09.796 --> 18:12.072
River City. Comms are down.

18:23.210 --> 18:24.313
Colonel Austin?

18:24.382 --> 18:25.727
Whatever it is,

18:25.796 --> 18:27.716
I'm sure it can wait till
after I've eaten lunch.

18:27.717 --> 18:29.269
Yes, sir.

18:42.484 --> 18:43.484
What?

18:43.486 --> 18:44.520
I need a favor.

18:44.589 --> 18:45.693
A favor?

18:45.762 --> 18:47.037
You have access

18:47.066 --> 18:48.666
to the colonel's satellite phone, right?

18:48.667 --> 18:50.072
I wouldn't call it "access".

18:50.141 --> 18:52.348
The comms are down, and
I need to call my family.

18:52.417 --> 18:53.831
Not a chance.

18:53.900 --> 18:55.486
I have to speak to them.

18:55.555 --> 18:57.555
My little brother has been missing.

18:57.624 --> 18:58.900
He might be in danger.

19:00.555 --> 19:02.279
I could get so busted.

19:02.348 --> 19:04.624
It would be a meaningful
sacrifice that would cement

19:04.693 --> 19:06.796
this wonderful new friendship of ours.

19:06.865 --> 19:08.762
We're not quite at wonderful just yet.

19:08.831 --> 19:11.555
Please, I beg you.

19:20.210 --> 19:22.279
Colonel eats fast, so make it quick.

19:22.348 --> 19:23.762
I will not forget this.

19:23.831 --> 19:25.934
Trust me, I won't let you.

19:37.210 --> 19:39.175
Ooh.

19:41.279 --> 19:42.486
What's he doing in there?

19:42.555 --> 19:44.831
Publicity, baby.

19:44.900 --> 19:47.762
Dude, soon as word spreads

19:47.831 --> 19:49.348
that Sasquatch is fighting this guy,

19:49.417 --> 19:51.865
it's gonna be like Godzilla versus Kong.

19:51.934 --> 19:53.244
And we are gonna clean up.

19:56.072 --> 19:58.486
Okay.

19:59.298 --> 20:01.998
_

20:02.900 --> 20:04.279
What's up with the Wi-Fi?

20:04.348 --> 20:05.382
River City.

20:05.451 --> 20:07.520
Comms on the whole base are shut down.

20:07.589 --> 20:09.589
No!

20:09.658 --> 20:10.658
Shit.

20:10.727 --> 20:11.767
Is everything all right?

20:11.831 --> 20:13.003
It's fine.

20:13.072 --> 20:14.392
Just a problem with the Internet.

20:14.451 --> 20:16.589
This happens every time a soldier dies.

20:16.658 --> 20:18.244
We shut down all communication.

20:18.313 --> 20:20.900
It'll be back up soon as
his family's been notified.

20:33.727 --> 20:35.072
He said, "No game, no fight".

20:35.141 --> 20:37.110
Thanks, Khalil. I got it.

20:37.179 --> 20:38.210
Good.

20:38.279 --> 20:39.310
Why are we on River City?

20:39.379 --> 20:40.417
Who didn't make it back?

20:40.486 --> 20:41.968
That kid you brought in yesterday.

20:42.037 --> 20:43.382
That double amputee.

20:43.451 --> 20:44.968
Louisville?

20:46.968 --> 20:47.968
Shit.

20:52.624 --> 20:54.727
What... what the fuck, Roback?

20:54.796 --> 20:55.831
You move my stuff?

20:55.900 --> 20:57.417
You mean did I clean up? Yes.

20:57.486 --> 20:58.968
What did you do with the letter?

20:59.037 --> 21:00.348
I didn't touch any letter.

21:00.417 --> 21:01.777
The letter for Louisville's wife.

21:01.846 --> 21:03.120
He didn't make it, and
I left it right here.

21:03.121 --> 21:04.382
Did you move my clothes?

21:04.451 --> 21:06.762
They were soaked in blood.
I took them to the laundry.

21:06.831 --> 21:08.796
You want to help me out?
Don't touch my stuff.

21:08.865 --> 21:11.900
- They were soaked in blood!
- My pants, my blood.

21:14.210 --> 21:15.486
Fuck.

21:20.417 --> 21:22.900
Why did I take the letter?

21:22.968 --> 21:24.865
I know better than to take the letter.

21:26.175 --> 21:27.934
You got to help me look for it.

21:28.003 --> 21:30.313
I just found out that
my 13-year-old brother

21:30.382 --> 21:32.417
tried to cross the border all by himself

21:32.486 --> 21:34.486
to see his old friends

21:34.555 --> 21:37.934
and he's now in a U.S. detention center.

21:39.555 --> 21:41.141
Jesus, I'm so sorry.

21:41.210 --> 21:42.865
Is he okay?

21:42.934 --> 21:44.382
We don't know.

21:44.451 --> 21:46.555
There is little information.

21:50.865 --> 21:52.762
- Oh, my God.
- What?

21:52.831 --> 21:55.520
You still haven't filled these out?

21:58.796 --> 22:01.313
Time to get your shit together, bro.

22:01.382 --> 22:05.348
If Louisville's wife
does not get closure,

22:05.417 --> 22:11.072
his ghost is gonna
haunt your ass forever.

22:11.141 --> 22:13.072
And so will I!

22:20.555 --> 22:22.520
All clear.

22:32.486 --> 22:33.693
Goat boy.

22:33.762 --> 22:36.693
You know, you were right about Boz.

22:36.762 --> 22:38.900
He was possessed by spirits.

22:40.106 --> 22:41.934
That is not what I thought.

22:42.003 --> 22:43.624
It is what its owner thought.

22:43.693 --> 22:45.037
And he is an idiot.

22:45.106 --> 22:46.831
No.

22:46.900 --> 22:48.210
No, he was right.

22:48.279 --> 22:49.865
It's a special goat.

22:49.934 --> 22:51.417
He saved my life.

22:52.589 --> 22:53.968
How nice for you.

22:57.624 --> 22:59.900
Hey, if you ever see it again,

22:59.968 --> 23:02.417
could you feed it and be nice to it?

23:02.486 --> 23:04.037
That'd mean a lot to me.

23:05.037 --> 23:07.279
For you, yes.

23:07.348 --> 23:08.589
Thanks.

23:32.658 --> 23:35.727
- You got a sec?
- No.

23:35.796 --> 23:38.417
It's important.

23:41.486 --> 23:42.658
Okay.

23:53.037 --> 23:55.313
So...

23:55.382 --> 23:57.313
a couple of days ago,

23:57.382 --> 24:00.762
we brought in this kid
who lost both his legs.

24:00.831 --> 24:02.968
And...

24:03.037 --> 24:05.348
While I was consoling him,

24:05.417 --> 24:06.796
we bonded.

24:06.865 --> 24:09.382
I like to do that.

24:09.451 --> 24:11.451
It's not part of my job description,

24:11.520 --> 24:12.796
but I believe it should be.

24:12.865 --> 24:15.727
Anyway, the kid died,

24:15.796 --> 24:19.244
but he's got this wife
back home that he loves.

24:21.727 --> 24:24.279
And he wrote her this letter.

24:24.348 --> 24:27.106
And he made me promise
that if he didn't make it,

24:27.175 --> 24:30.279
I'd be sure to get it to her.

24:30.348 --> 24:32.268
But there's just one
problem. There's no address.

24:32.337 --> 24:33.817
Alvarez told me you lost the letter.

24:33.820 --> 24:35.624
Fuck. Okay.

24:35.693 --> 24:37.762
I'm not cool with how close
you two are becoming.

24:37.831 --> 24:40.417
Yeah, I lost the kid's letter.

24:40.486 --> 24:41.968
But I fixed it. I wrote a new letter.

24:42.016 --> 24:43.416
The wife won't know the difference.

24:43.417 --> 24:44.658
Have you lost your mind?

24:44.727 --> 24:46.327
I'm not sending a fake
letter to a widow.

24:46.328 --> 24:47.417
Why not?

24:47.486 --> 24:48.831
She's his wife.

24:48.900 --> 24:50.700
She's gonna see through
that shit in a second.

24:50.701 --> 24:53.037
He's a 19-year-old kid
from horse country.

24:53.106 --> 24:54.175
How hard could it be?

24:54.244 --> 24:55.317
A "sweetheart" here,

24:55.386 --> 24:56.967
a "best thing that ever
happened to me" there.

24:56.968 --> 24:58.608
And the widow gets
some beautiful memories

24:58.677 --> 24:59.708
and some closure.

24:59.777 --> 25:01.279
You don't want that for her?

25:01.348 --> 25:03.003
Just read it.

25:03.072 --> 25:05.313
If it doesn't melt your
heart, then I won't send it.

25:12.313 --> 25:17.072
To my dearest widow's name here...

25:17.141 --> 25:18.693
What? I don't have her name.

25:18.762 --> 25:21.210
I was hoping you could
help me with that too.

25:21.279 --> 25:22.796
If you are reading this,

25:22.865 --> 25:25.382
then the calamity of our
worst fears has come to pass.

25:25.451 --> 25:27.727
I have lost my light
on the field of battle.

25:27.796 --> 25:30.106
I pray that your grief...

25:30.175 --> 25:32.934
Did he die in the Civil War?

25:33.003 --> 25:35.244
She doesn't need a letter.

25:35.313 --> 25:36.520
Once she gets over the shock,

25:36.589 --> 25:37.792
she's gonna be flooded with memories

25:37.793 --> 25:39.141
of all the good times they had.

25:39.210 --> 25:40.930
And those are gonna be
her forever memories,

25:40.931 --> 25:42.827
not this cornpone bullshit.

25:54.831 --> 25:56.693
You've got a big heart.

25:58.693 --> 25:59.796
I do?

25:59.865 --> 26:01.486
- You do.
- Mm-hmm.

26:01.555 --> 26:03.865
But I'm still not gonna let
you fuck me ever again.

26:05.693 --> 26:07.968
I checked, by the way.

26:08.037 --> 26:10.727
There isn't a Blue
Forward Operating Base.

26:10.796 --> 26:12.762
Shit.

26:15.003 --> 26:16.037
Thanks.

26:29.968 --> 26:31.555
What's up?

26:31.624 --> 26:33.141
Come with me.

26:34.762 --> 26:36.072
Leave that.

26:36.141 --> 26:39.348
♪ It's okay, relax ♪

26:39.417 --> 26:41.831
♪ You're just in love ♪

26:51.589 --> 26:54.727
♪ It's okay, relax ♪

26:54.796 --> 26:59.106
♪ You're just in love ♪

26:59.175 --> 27:01.555
Consider this my apology.

27:01.624 --> 27:03.106
For what?

27:08.003 --> 27:10.762
For not trusting you, mate.

27:10.831 --> 27:11.968
I've been

27:12.037 --> 27:13.693
shooting my mouth off all over camp

27:13.762 --> 27:16.727
about how you and Roback
had shite up to your eyebrows

27:16.796 --> 27:18.555
regarding this fight.

27:18.624 --> 27:21.003
Little did I know,

27:21.072 --> 27:24.106
you'd found us the Afghan Ali.

27:24.175 --> 27:25.417
You mean the bodyguard?

27:25.486 --> 27:27.313
Fucking oath, I mean the bodyguard.

27:28.515 --> 27:29.955
That was a genius move, you bringing

27:29.956 --> 27:32.313
that Taliban Tyson
around for a sneak peek.

27:32.382 --> 27:35.175
He's like a Marvel villain, yeah?

27:35.244 --> 27:37.364
Boys in the kitchen, they
can't stop talking about it.

27:37.417 --> 27:39.934
They're phoning their
mums for extra bet money.

27:40.003 --> 27:42.351
You lit a fuse, Davers.

27:43.520 --> 27:45.244
You lit a fuse.

27:45.313 --> 27:46.555
Okay, look.

27:46.624 --> 27:49.796
That's, um...

27:49.865 --> 27:51.451
We might need to postpone.

27:51.520 --> 27:53.210
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

27:53.279 --> 27:55.175
You delay, and people
have second thoughts.

27:55.244 --> 27:57.520
This fight is a go, baby doll.

27:57.589 --> 27:59.451
There are a lot of moving parts here,

27:59.520 --> 28:00.658
and I'm really not...

28:00.727 --> 28:03.072
Don't worry about that, partner.

28:03.141 --> 28:05.541
I'm getting more action than I
can probably handle, you know?

28:05.542 --> 28:07.624
Even Colonel Austin,
he laid down a C-note.

28:07.693 --> 28:09.727
The big money's riding on your boy.

28:09.796 --> 28:12.382
You really think he can take Sasquatch?

28:15.072 --> 28:17.900
Right now, it's not even a contest.

28:17.968 --> 28:19.520
Tasty, mate.

28:19.589 --> 28:21.486
Very tasty.

28:21.555 --> 28:24.210
We are gonna make out like bandits.

28:24.279 --> 28:26.520
Make sure Ali's keeping fit, yeah?

28:26.589 --> 28:28.244
Sleeping well, he's eating right.

28:28.313 --> 28:29.727
If he needs a proper training diet,

28:29.796 --> 28:31.555
I will fix up the halal

28:31.624 --> 28:36.244
so he's a lean, mean Afghan machine.

28:36.313 --> 28:37.934
Hip, hip, halal.

28:44.382 --> 28:46.313
You lose a patient too?

28:46.382 --> 28:47.968
Not that I'm aware of.

28:48.037 --> 28:49.477
Well, then only one of us at a time

28:49.520 --> 28:52.762
is allowed to be in a somber funk.

28:52.831 --> 28:55.072
You're too empathetic to be a surgeon.

28:55.141 --> 28:56.624
As you well know,

28:56.693 --> 28:59.141
it is both a gift and a curse.

28:59.210 --> 29:00.865
Yes.

29:00.934 --> 29:03.072
And I'm starting to
worry it's contagious.

29:05.796 --> 29:07.555
- Good news, Major.
- What's that?

29:07.624 --> 29:09.210
River City is no more.

29:09.279 --> 29:10.762
Comms are back up.

29:10.831 --> 29:12.417
You can call family.

29:14.589 --> 29:16.106
Oh, it was a nightmare.

29:16.175 --> 29:18.382
But at least the kids
got their vaccinations.

29:18.451 --> 29:19.589
Mm.

29:20.968 --> 29:23.037
I am so ready to have you home.

29:23.106 --> 29:25.900
I'm ready to be home.

29:25.968 --> 29:27.328
When you're back, we need to talk

29:27.329 --> 29:28.624
about this hippie school.

29:28.693 --> 29:30.934
I mean, who doesn't
enforce vaccinations?

29:31.003 --> 29:33.451
If you want your kid to get polio, fine.

29:33.520 --> 29:36.486
But don't put my kids at risk.

29:36.555 --> 29:38.072
Hope I'm not interrupting, sir.

29:38.141 --> 29:39.382
You are.

29:39.451 --> 29:41.727
But an interruption was
just what I was hoping for.

29:41.796 --> 29:43.313
Please, sit.

29:43.382 --> 29:44.900
Sir,

29:44.968 --> 29:47.417
I've been thinking about
your frustration with SecCorp

29:47.486 --> 29:49.417
interfering with our
work with the locals.

29:49.486 --> 29:51.417
And I think I might have a way to help.

29:51.486 --> 29:53.658
If it involves poisoning
SecCorp's steroid supply,

29:53.727 --> 29:54.762
I'm in.

29:54.831 --> 29:55.968
Afraid not, sir.

29:55.997 --> 29:57.597
The local population has been struggling

29:57.598 --> 29:58.934
with influenza, typhoid.

29:59.003 --> 30:00.382
For minimal cost,

30:00.451 --> 30:01.665
we could set up a free clinic.

30:01.734 --> 30:03.243
These villages aren't secure, Major.

30:03.244 --> 30:04.451
And I don't have the manpower

30:04.480 --> 30:05.840
to establish a permanent location.

30:05.841 --> 30:08.003
Not permanent, sir. Mobile.

30:08.072 --> 30:10.555
A caravan with minimal medical staff.

30:10.624 --> 30:12.451
We roll into town on
non-predetermined dates

30:12.520 --> 30:14.520
to avoid attacks and provide services

30:14.589 --> 30:17.348
to the local population and
hopefully their children.

30:17.417 --> 30:19.279
- Close contact.
- Builds trust.

30:19.348 --> 30:20.988
Maybe even helps them
learn the difference

30:20.989 --> 30:22.644
between our troops and SecCorp.

30:25.106 --> 30:26.762
How long have you been deployed, Major?

30:26.831 --> 30:30.313
This is my second tour.
17 months total, sir.

30:30.382 --> 30:32.900
That means your PCS is up in a month.

30:32.968 --> 30:36.417
You can't build any trust
with these people in a month.

30:36.486 --> 30:37.968
They need consistency.

30:38.037 --> 30:39.555
They need a face,

30:39.624 --> 30:42.210
something to help them
see past the uniform.

30:42.279 --> 30:43.900
That means at least six months.

30:43.968 --> 30:45.589
Yes, sir.

30:45.658 --> 30:48.451
Sonia, if you start this,

30:48.520 --> 30:50.279
you have to finish it.

30:50.348 --> 30:52.348
That face has to be yours.

30:59.210 --> 31:01.244
You ready to extend your
deployment that long?

31:02.451 --> 31:05.037
Would you think less
of me if I said yes?

31:11.968 --> 31:15.831
No, Major, I would not.

31:15.900 --> 31:18.279
And since we're being
candid with one another,

31:18.348 --> 31:20.900
I'll tell you you're not the
only one who feels this way.

31:22.520 --> 31:24.589
I've been deployed so many times,

31:24.658 --> 31:25.900
I'm not sure I'd remember

31:25.928 --> 31:27.528
how to get from the airport to my house.

31:27.529 --> 31:29.520
And the sad truth is,

31:29.589 --> 31:31.549
the distance I've put
between myself and my family

31:31.550 --> 31:33.550
has been, for the most part, deliberate.

31:36.417 --> 31:38.279
It's, uh...

31:38.348 --> 31:40.313
it's gotten so bad that

31:40.382 --> 31:42.624
halfway through a
conversation with my family,

31:42.693 --> 31:45.313
I fantasize that I dialed
the wrong number

31:45.382 --> 31:47.244
and I got somebody
else's family by mistake.

31:48.865 --> 31:51.762
The urge to just hang up is...

31:51.831 --> 31:54.141
overwhelming.

31:59.934 --> 32:02.348
Request approved.

32:02.417 --> 32:04.141
Keep me updated.

32:04.210 --> 32:06.348
Thank you, sir.

32:06.417 --> 32:09.003
I'll get started right away.

32:09.072 --> 32:10.072
Major.

32:13.313 --> 32:16.382
I'll keep your little secret
if you can keep mine.

32:21.762 --> 32:25.072
Private Mulligan.

32:25.141 --> 32:26.934
Here, sir.

32:27.003 --> 32:30.141
Corporal Rondiak.

32:32.141 --> 32:36.451
Corporal Wesley Rondiak.

32:36.520 --> 32:39.175
Corporal Rondiak is
no longer with us, sir.

32:40.451 --> 32:42.727
Louisville's ghost is
coming to get me, man.

32:42.796 --> 32:45.175
Eat lots of garlic. I hear it helps.

32:45.244 --> 32:47.451
- I think that's vampires.
- Can't hurt.

32:51.106 --> 32:53.900
I really fucked this one up.

32:53.968 --> 32:55.693
It happens.

32:55.762 --> 32:57.175
Yeah.

32:59.279 --> 33:00.727
How's it going with our fight?

33:00.796 --> 33:02.589
- People are getting excited.
- That's good.

33:02.658 --> 33:04.106
Where are we with Sasquatch?

33:04.175 --> 33:05.175
Nowhere.

33:05.210 --> 33:06.727
He wants the Blue FOB.

33:06.796 --> 33:09.382
- What's the Blue FOB?
- No clue.

33:09.451 --> 33:10.451
Then no fight.

33:10.486 --> 33:12.417
It's looking that way.

33:12.486 --> 33:15.382
Time for gun to meet mouth.

33:15.451 --> 33:17.279
Only way I'm gonna get my mom any money

33:17.348 --> 33:19.796
is if I'm dead so she could
collect the life insurance.

33:19.865 --> 33:23.624
They don't pay out on suicides.

33:23.693 --> 33:27.003
They're playing my song, amigo.

33:40.734 --> 33:42.182
Can you give us a second, Crash?

33:42.251 --> 33:43.562
Uh-oh.

33:43.631 --> 33:45.151
Looks like I'm in Dutch with the wife.

33:47.941 --> 33:48.941
Yeah.

33:51.493 --> 33:52.665
This is smart.

33:52.734 --> 33:53.982
Really sells the marriage

33:54.051 --> 33:55.974
if we pick public places
to be mad at each other.

33:55.975 --> 33:57.975
Maybe next week, I'll make
a big scene in the DFAC,

33:58.044 --> 34:00.084
accusing you of not letting
me hang with my buddies.

34:00.085 --> 34:01.562
I found your stupid letter.

34:01.631 --> 34:03.562
That's great. Where was it?

34:05.320 --> 34:07.320
If you had taken one
second to fill these out,

34:07.379 --> 34:08.699
you would have found it yourself.

34:08.699 --> 34:10.260
Promise I will fill out all these forms

34:10.261 --> 34:11.606
as soon as I mail this.

34:12.734 --> 34:13.734
Oh, shit.

34:16.630 --> 34:18.431
Blood must have eaten
right through the paper.

34:20.079 --> 34:21.217
I still got the letter.

34:21.286 --> 34:22.699
So I'll get the address from Durkin

34:22.768 --> 34:24.128
and just put it in a new envelope.

34:24.129 --> 34:26.320
- Simple.
- Yeah.

34:26.389 --> 34:27.940
What?

34:30.768 --> 34:32.871
Nothing, I just...

34:32.940 --> 34:35.734
never read one of these before.

34:35.803 --> 34:37.527
Me neither.

34:43.458 --> 34:45.699
Dear Jenny, I'm dead.

34:45.768 --> 34:47.251
But don't feel bad,

34:47.320 --> 34:49.239
because I've been dead
since the night I met you,

34:49.241 --> 34:50.940
you filthy, no-good piece of trash.

34:51.010 --> 34:53.355
I only married you because
you were pregnant,

34:53.424 --> 34:54.906
which you, of course, were not.

34:54.975 --> 34:56.596
You were just fat,

34:56.665 --> 34:59.286
you three-Slurpee-drinking,
dog-jack-offing royal slut.

34:59.355 --> 35:02.148
I hope my life insurance money
lets you throw a big party.

35:02.217 --> 35:03.493
I also hope you'll get so drunk

35:03.562 --> 35:05.217
that you choke on your own puke.

35:05.286 --> 35:06.562
See you in hell, bitch.

35:06.631 --> 35:08.700
Worst wishes, Wes.

35:10.665 --> 35:12.079
So I guess I'll mail this.

35:12.148 --> 35:14.113
What? No.

35:14.182 --> 35:15.424
Throw it in the trash.

35:15.493 --> 35:17.975
- But what about closure?
- Screw closure.

35:18.044 --> 35:20.148
The royal slut does not need closure.

35:20.217 --> 35:21.906
I'm talking about my closure.

35:21.975 --> 35:23.286
You're the one who said

35:23.355 --> 35:25.251
his ghost was gonna
come back and haunt me.

35:25.320 --> 35:26.458
Come on.

35:26.527 --> 35:28.665
You're not afraid of a ghost, are you?

35:29.872 --> 35:31.424
I promised him.

35:31.493 --> 35:34.148
Okay, you're right.

35:34.217 --> 35:35.355
- Send it.
- Yeah.

35:35.424 --> 35:37.182
Let Louisville get the last word.

35:38.700 --> 35:40.631
Soaked in blood. Should I rewrite it?

35:40.700 --> 35:41.872
No.

35:41.941 --> 35:44.700
If the royal slut is as
bad as he says she is,

35:44.768 --> 35:48.010
she'll be happy to see his
blood all over the letter

35:48.079 --> 35:50.837
and get her own closure.

35:50.906 --> 35:52.665
- It's a win-win.
- Mm-hmm.

35:56.562 --> 35:57.906
Guess if we never get divorced,

35:57.975 --> 35:59.423
it'll keep us from making
the same stupid mistakes

35:59.424 --> 36:00.544
everybody else keeps making.

36:00.562 --> 36:03.355
What's that?

36:03.424 --> 36:05.010
Marrying for love.

36:23.217 --> 36:25.217
All right, this area will
serve as our medi-camp.

36:25.286 --> 36:26.493
Let's get the Red Cross up

36:26.562 --> 36:28.286
and secure posts on
both ends of this road.

36:31.044 --> 36:33.044
I'd like a separate exam
room set up for the women.

36:33.113 --> 36:35.631
Let's keep everyone feeling
as comfortable as possible.

36:44.251 --> 36:45.975
What is all this?

36:46.044 --> 36:50.182
The army is establishing
a free medical clinic.

36:50.251 --> 36:53.113
Open to everyone, especially children.

36:53.182 --> 36:55.079
It will be quite welcome.

36:55.148 --> 36:57.079
Hoping we can make a difference.

36:58.182 --> 37:00.113
We'll be here once a month.

37:00.182 --> 37:02.251
Be nice if we had
somebody we could trust

37:02.320 --> 37:03.768
to alert the locals.

37:03.837 --> 37:05.037
I know of someone like that.

37:05.079 --> 37:06.320
Your brother Qasem.

37:06.389 --> 37:08.872
No, me.

37:08.941 --> 37:10.493
I would be happy to help.

37:11.665 --> 37:14.665
Well, thanks.

37:14.734 --> 37:15.941
I should get to it.

37:17.631 --> 37:19.010
Good luck with this.

37:49.458 --> 37:52.320
Let me just check those plates.

37:52.389 --> 37:53.768
Lightning, lightning, lightning!

38:29.872 --> 38:31.182
Gate to Base.

38:31.251 --> 38:33.251
Looks like we just found
those stolen uniforms.

38:33.320 --> 38:35.113
Over.

38:43.225 --> 38:48.725
