<i> (Bob panting)</i>

00:21.188 --> 00:22.187
I'm whipping you so hard.

00:22.339 --> 00:23.505
Turn into cream!

00:23.673 --> 00:26.099
-Get a room, you two.
-We did get a room, Gene.

00:26.252 --> 00:27.342
It's called the kitchen.

00:27.361 --> 00:29.253
I'm making whipped cream
for your mom

00:29.271 --> 00:30.587
for her Mother's Day waffles,

00:30.680 --> 00:32.439
which you kids are
supposed to be helping me with.

00:32.533 --> 00:34.424
Sorry, Dad.
We have our hands full.

00:34.593 --> 00:35.517
Tina had to make a card,

00:35.536 --> 00:37.277
we had to tell her
to make the card.

00:37.371 --> 00:38.871
-Tina, let's see it.
-Read it and weep.

00:39.022 --> 00:40.522
Or lightly chuckle
because it's pretty funny.

00:40.541 --> 00:42.690
It's a drawing of
a mushroom cloud

00:42.785 --> 00:44.601
and all of us flying through
the air, and it says,

00:44.620 --> 00:46.378
-"You dropped a mom on us"?
-Pretty good, right?

00:46.530 --> 00:49.456
Yeah, but you made this
exact same card two years ago.

00:49.533 --> 00:50.883
Damn it,
I knew it felt familiar.

00:51.034 --> 00:52.718
We got to think of
something else, and quick.

00:52.869 --> 00:54.294
-LINDA: Think of what?
-Uh...

00:54.446 --> 00:55.554
KIDS:
Happy Mother's Day!

00:55.705 --> 00:58.039
-Aw, thanks.
-Ugh. Happy Mother's Day, Lin.

00:58.133 --> 00:59.575
Wow, you're sweaty.

00:59.577 --> 01:00.784
What's in the box?

01:00.953 --> 01:02.227
Is it a tiny little
David Blaine?

01:02.379 --> 01:03.637
Eh, I was thinking
about my mother.

01:03.789 --> 01:05.672
And then I started to think
about my grandmother,

01:05.824 --> 01:08.216
and I wanted to find a picture
of her, and I found this.

01:08.235 --> 01:09.717
A box full of old family stuff.

01:09.812 --> 01:12.554
"Old family stuff."
Those are three exciting words.

01:12.648 --> 01:13.997
I wanted to look through it

01:13.999 --> 01:15.557
while we have
Mother's Day breakfast.

01:15.576 --> 01:18.802
Aw, here she is.
My sweet Grandma Claudia.

01:18.821 --> 01:21.955
Oh, I just loved her so much.
Ooh, family tree.

01:22.065 --> 01:23.490
Let's see what we have here.

01:23.567 --> 01:25.400
-Any celebrities or criminals?
-Portia de Rossi?

01:25.419 --> 01:27.586
Oh, that says "Peter DeRosa."

01:27.737 --> 01:29.479
Still though, pretty cool.

01:29.498 --> 01:31.406
LOUISE: Wait, why is
this whole section crossed out?

01:31.483 --> 01:33.150
Oh, that's because of the feud.

01:33.168 --> 01:35.410
Wha-Wha-What? A feud?

01:35.429 --> 01:37.579
Something interesting happened
in our family?

01:37.598 --> 01:40.674
I think you're forgetting about
Dad's uncle with huge feet.

01:40.843 --> 01:42.434
Oh, yeah, Uncle Frank.
Good swimmer.

01:42.620 --> 01:44.436
Well, it's kind of a long story,
but I'll tell you.

01:44.663 --> 01:46.847
This thing started
way before I was born.

01:46.999 --> 01:48.498
My great-grandma Maria
had four kids,

01:48.517 --> 01:50.091
and they didn't have
a lot of money.

01:50.111 --> 01:51.610
<i> One of them, Tony,</i>
<i> worked down at the docks.</i>

01:51.761 --> 01:53.261
<i> And he was trying</i>
<i> to save up to buy</i>

01:53.430 --> 01:54.929
<i> his dream house</i>
<i> in Staten Island.</i>

01:54.949 --> 01:57.007
<i> GENE:</i>
<i> I think Billy Joel</i>
<i> wrote a song about that.</i>

01:57.025 --> 01:59.693
<i> LINDA:</i>
<i> But Joey, the baby of</i>
<i>the family, married a rich girl.</i>

01:59.845 --> 02:01.603
<i> I think her father</i>
<i> invented the raincoat.</i>

02:01.697 --> 02:02.979
-Probably not.
-Shush!

02:02.981 --> 02:05.365
<i> And then Joey</i>
<i> and his new rich wife</i>

02:05.517 --> 02:08.127
<i> bought Tony's dream house</i>
<i> before Tony could!</i>

02:08.278 --> 02:10.278
-Damn.
-So, is that why someone crossed

02:10.297 --> 02:12.113
all of Joey's family out
on the family tree?

02:12.133 --> 02:13.298
No. There's more.

02:13.450 --> 02:15.025
You see, Joey invited
the family over

02:15.118 --> 02:16.193
<i> to his new house for dinner.</i>

02:16.286 --> 02:18.303
<i> And my great-grandmother Maria</i>

02:18.530 --> 02:20.380
<i> brought over</i>
<i> her famous Bolognese sauce.</i>

02:20.532 --> 02:21.789
(whispers loudly):
Say more about the sauce.

02:21.809 --> 02:24.309
-(whispers): It was
delicious, Gene.
-I knew it.

02:24.461 --> 02:25.869
(normal voice):
And then it happened.

02:25.888 --> 02:27.587
-(gasps)
-I didn't say what it was yet.

02:27.723 --> 02:28.814
Sorry, it's just tense.

02:29.041 --> 02:30.390
<i> LINDA:</i>
<i> So, they're eating dinner,</i>

02:30.484 --> 02:32.317
<i> and Joey is</i>
<i> just laughing and laughing</i>

02:32.469 --> 02:33.710
<i> about how great</i>
<i> his new house is.</i>

02:33.729 --> 02:36.062
<i> But as he reaches</i>
<i> for the Parmesan cheese,</i>

02:36.215 --> 02:38.640
<i> Tony goes in with his fork</i>
<i> to get more pasta</i>

02:38.734 --> 02:41.735
<i> and accidentally stabs Joey</i>
<i> in the hand!</i>

02:41.887 --> 02:43.403
<i> LOUISE:</i>
<i> Yes! He forked him!</i>

02:43.497 --> 02:45.238
-(gasps)
-Joey and his sister Paulina

02:45.332 --> 02:46.981
<i> thought Tony forked him</i>
<i> on purpose</i>

02:47.001 --> 02:48.909
<i> because Joey bought</i>
<i> Tony's dream house</i>

02:49.061 --> 02:50.577
<i> with Daniela's</i>
<i> stupid raincoat money.</i>

02:50.729 --> 02:53.063
-It-it couldn't
have been raincoat.
-It was.

02:53.156 --> 02:54.656
<i> But Tony swore</i>
<i> that it was an accident,</i>

02:54.824 --> 02:57.342
<i> and his sister Claudia,</i>
<i> my sweet little grandmother,</i>

02:57.419 --> 02:58.493
<i> believed him.</i>

02:58.512 --> 03:00.512
<i> Joey throws Tony</i>
<i> out of the house.</i>

03:00.664 --> 03:02.906
<i> Claudia and her husband Burt,</i>
<i> my grandfather, go with him.</i>

03:02.999 --> 03:05.166
<i> And here's the kicker:</i>
<i> it's pouring rain.</i>

03:05.244 --> 03:06.426
<i> None of them have raincoats.</i>

03:06.520 --> 03:07.835
<i> They all get wet.</i>

03:07.930 --> 03:09.262
From that moment on,

03:09.356 --> 03:11.005
you were either
Team Tony or Team Joey.

03:11.083 --> 03:12.357
So we're on team...?

03:12.559 --> 03:13.859
Tony. All the way.

03:13.936 --> 03:15.510
And Tony's the one who...?

03:15.529 --> 03:17.604
Accidentally forked
that jerk Joey.

03:17.756 --> 03:19.031
You never met any Team Joeys

03:19.258 --> 03:20.848
'cause we stopped talking
to them, 'cause they're dumb.

03:20.868 --> 03:22.426
And you want to know
the worst part?

03:22.444 --> 03:23.944
Then the Great Depression
happened?

03:24.038 --> 03:27.039
No. After my lovely
great-grandmother Maria passed,

03:27.190 --> 03:29.616
dumb Joey, his wife Daniela
and their idiot kid

03:29.710 --> 03:32.211
went over to her house,
went through all her stuff

03:32.362 --> 03:34.195
and stole
the only written-down copy

03:34.215 --> 03:36.790
of Grandma Maria's
famous Bolognese recipe.

03:36.884 --> 03:38.199
They did what?!

03:38.277 --> 03:39.701
My Grandma Claudia knew
how to make it,

03:39.869 --> 03:41.202
and she used to make it for me,

03:41.255 --> 03:42.721
and it was delicious,
but she died,

03:42.872 --> 03:45.373
and so now I can only
taste the sauce in my memories.

03:45.392 --> 03:46.892
-In your mammaries?
-Gene.

03:47.043 --> 03:48.285
So now the only people who know

03:48.378 --> 03:50.044
how to make it
are those cold-hearted,

03:50.064 --> 03:51.563
house-stealing Team Joey people.

03:51.715 --> 03:54.733
(singsongy):
Who wants waffles
with homemade whipped cream?

03:54.884 --> 03:57.736
-I do.
-I mean, sort of whipped.

03:57.887 --> 04:00.130
It's really hard to do.
My wrist hurts.

04:00.148 --> 04:01.481
-Anyway, here you go.
-Oh.

04:01.633 --> 04:03.467
Ew. Did you just pour milk
on her waffles?

04:03.560 --> 04:04.968
Damn it.
The kids didn't help at all.

04:04.987 --> 04:07.412
Because we're, uh, doing
our own thing for Mom.

04:07.639 --> 04:09.248
-We're giving it to her later.
-We are?

04:09.399 --> 04:11.324
Yes.
And it's really, really great.

04:11.401 --> 04:13.418
-Wait, did I miss a meeting?
-(sighs) Ignore Tina.

04:13.645 --> 04:16.329
Why don't we focus on
Dad's wet milk waffles for now.

04:16.423 --> 04:17.981
(sighs) I'll make you new ones.

04:18.116 --> 04:20.500
-Gene will eat those.
-Yay! Floppy waffles.

04:20.594 --> 04:23.244
Floppy, floppy, floppy, floppy.
(sputters lips)

04:23.338 --> 04:25.655
So, Teddy, what'd you get
your mom for Mother's Day?

04:25.674 --> 04:27.766
Well, you know how
she's pretty tatted up?

04:27.993 --> 04:29.175
What? No.

04:29.328 --> 04:30.936
Yeah, well, she's got a tattoo
that she hates,

04:31.087 --> 04:34.331
so I booked her an appointment
at a laser tattoo removal place.

04:34.424 --> 04:35.181
Okay.

04:35.276 --> 04:36.516
But it's kind of expensive.

04:36.668 --> 04:38.835
-How expensive?
-Well, it's $500 a visit,

04:38.854 --> 04:40.353
and it can take
a bunch of visits.

04:40.506 --> 04:41.688
Which I wasn't totally aware of

04:41.840 --> 04:43.523
when I was signing her up
for the first lasering.

04:43.600 --> 04:45.450
-That's a lot of money.
-I know.

04:45.527 --> 04:47.619
-But she really wants it gone.
-Why?

04:47.771 --> 04:49.513
-What-What's it a tattoo of?
-Uh, I'll show you.

04:49.531 --> 04:51.957
Here, check a look.
It's on her upper, upper thigh.

04:52.184 --> 04:53.941
BOB:
Oh. Gr-Great.

04:53.961 --> 04:55.610
So, it's a tattoo of
a bunch of playing cards?

04:55.629 --> 04:57.370
It's a gin rummy thing.
She was in a group,

04:57.464 --> 04:59.205
and I guess they all got
the same tattoo.

04:59.282 --> 05:01.133
-Aw, gin rummy chummies.
-(door opens)

05:01.209 --> 05:02.692
-Well, not anymore.
-(door closes)

05:02.711 --> 05:05.119
My mom plays with,
let's say, a lot of flare.

05:05.213 --> 05:06.805
And by "flare," I mean rage.

05:07.032 --> 05:08.365
Your mom sounds intense.

05:08.383 --> 05:10.475
-She's passionate, Bob.
-Wait, I have an idea.

05:10.702 --> 05:12.702
Maybe she doesn't
have to remove her tattoo.

05:12.796 --> 05:14.646
Why doesn't she just add
to what's already there?

05:14.798 --> 05:17.316
Make it into something else?
I bet that's cheaper.

05:17.467 --> 05:19.634
-I mean, probably?
-Hey, we should brainstorm.

05:19.711 --> 05:22.637
-Ooh, we can use the chalkboard.
-Oh, uh-- Heh.

05:22.656 --> 05:24.639
That's where I put the Burger
of the Day that I wrote,

05:24.658 --> 05:27.475
carefully, so people know
what it is.

05:27.494 --> 05:28.735
And you erased it.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.570
This is just for a minute.
I'll remember it.

05:30.664 --> 05:33.390
-It was
a something-something burger.
-Yup.

05:33.392 --> 05:35.058
(quietly):
So, what are we getting for Mom?

05:35.151 --> 05:36.501
A different card from Tina?

05:36.653 --> 05:38.078
Oh, okay. Lot of pressure.

05:38.172 --> 05:40.488
Wait. O-mama bin Lovin'?

05:40.582 --> 05:41.322
That's been done.

05:41.342 --> 05:42.990
No. What we're gonna do is

05:43.068 --> 05:45.344
get that old family sauce recipe
and we're gonna cook it for Mom

05:45.571 --> 05:48.213
and give her the greatest
Mother's Day dinner of all time.

05:48.440 --> 05:49.681
You had me at "sauce."

05:49.908 --> 05:51.165
Where are we gonna get
the recipe?

05:51.185 --> 05:53.243
I found out
where Lorraine lives.

05:53.261 --> 05:55.336
-Who's Lorraine?
-Joey's daughter.

05:55.356 --> 05:57.171
Got it. Who's Joey again?

05:57.191 --> 05:58.857
He's Great-Grandma Claudia's
brother.

05:59.008 --> 06:00.083
Just look at this.

06:00.102 --> 06:01.843
Mom said Joey took the recipe.

06:01.937 --> 06:04.254
Since he's passed on,
smart money is that

06:04.272 --> 06:06.272
his only daughter, Lorraine,
has it now.

06:06.367 --> 06:08.274
Guess what.
She lives in Bottom Hook,

06:08.369 --> 06:09.684
which is only eight miles away.

06:09.703 --> 06:11.352
Yes. Louise,
this is such a good idea.

06:11.430 --> 06:13.113
-I know.
-Wait, how are we
gonna get there?

06:13.207 --> 06:14.206
No clue.

06:14.357 --> 06:15.207
You kids help out
around here, right?

06:15.358 --> 06:16.691
I-I'm just checking because

06:16.785 --> 06:19.360
sometimes it feels like
you don't help out at all.

06:19.380 --> 06:21.529
-We're taking a hiatus.
-Dad, just shush.

06:21.623 --> 06:23.715
We think we found
where the sauce recipe might be.

06:23.867 --> 06:26.943
It's only eight miles away at
Mom's cousin Lorraine's house.

06:26.962 --> 06:28.202
Go get your car keys.

06:28.222 --> 06:29.963
Oh, that's actually
a really sweet idea,

06:30.057 --> 06:31.448
but we can't leave
your mom alone

06:31.466 --> 06:33.408
in the restaurant
on Mother's Day.

06:33.410 --> 06:35.376
-(quietly): Boo.
-Don't boo me.

06:35.396 --> 06:38.638
Look, maybe you guys can
save this idea for next year.

06:38.790 --> 06:40.640
-(quietly): Boo.
-Stop booing me.

06:40.792 --> 06:42.642
What if we get another ride?

06:42.794 --> 06:43.810
Do you know someone with a car?

06:43.904 --> 06:45.311
And don't say Ken
because he's not real.

06:45.464 --> 06:47.297
He is real
and he's a very good driver,

06:47.390 --> 06:48.798
but he's getting
his Jeep lowered today.

06:48.967 --> 06:51.576
(gasps) I think I might know
someone who could take us.

06:51.728 --> 06:53.745
Is it someone we know and trust?

06:53.897 --> 06:55.247
It's someone we know.

06:55.398 --> 06:57.323
So I got my license
un-suspended,

06:57.476 --> 06:59.659
then they said I needed
to take the eye test again,

06:59.753 --> 07:02.236
but I was like, "Nah,
this prescription is fine."

07:02.256 --> 07:03.571
-Oh!
-(tires screech)
-(kids scream)

07:03.665 --> 07:05.382
Sorry. This road is so curvy.

07:08.411 --> 07:10.837
Ugh, I can't believe
we're actually going

07:10.931 --> 07:12.597
to that punk
Lorraine Parcone's house.

07:12.749 --> 07:15.600
And possibly to a soft serve
drive-through on the way? Eh?

07:15.827 --> 07:17.494
Aunt Gayle, you and Mom
still get pretty frothy

07:17.512 --> 07:19.938
about the whole
forking thing, huh?

07:20.165 --> 07:21.331
It started with the forking.

07:21.424 --> 07:23.333
Then there was the recipe theft,
of course,

07:23.351 --> 07:24.943
but the bad blood's
been passed down

07:25.170 --> 07:26.594
from generation to generation.

07:26.613 --> 07:29.263
-You know about
the wedding incident?
-KIDS: No.

07:29.283 --> 07:31.265
It was my mother
and father's wedding--

07:31.285 --> 07:33.452
your grandparents--
and my Grandma Claudia

07:33.679 --> 07:36.771
<i> made them invite everyone</i>
<i> to try to make peace.</i>

07:36.865 --> 07:38.348
<i> It was a disaster.</i>

07:38.366 --> 07:40.183
<i> Lorraine Parcone wore white.</i>

07:40.202 --> 07:41.776
<i> I mean, I think it was</i>
<i> a full wedding dress.</i>

07:41.870 --> 07:44.796
-Poor Grandma Gloria.
-Well, she got Lorraine back.

07:45.023 --> 07:45.947
Literally.

07:45.966 --> 07:47.207
<i>She poured punch down her back,</i>

07:47.359 --> 07:48.633
<i> and then she punched her</i>
<i> in the back.</i>

07:48.860 --> 07:50.302
<i> I hear it was</i>
<i> a beautiful wedding.</i>

07:50.453 --> 07:51.211
Sounds lovely.

07:51.363 --> 07:52.879
Well, you know me, Aunt Gayle.

07:53.031 --> 07:54.380
I love a good family feud.

07:54.475 --> 07:56.624
But today, the plan is
to put all that aside.

07:56.718 --> 07:59.369
Tomorrow, you can go back
to feuding it up. Okay?

07:59.387 --> 08:01.705
Yeah, do it for Mom.
It's Mother's Day.

08:01.798 --> 08:04.541
I mean, she's not your mother,
but she's a damn good woman.

08:04.634 --> 08:05.558
Ugh, Mother's Day.

08:05.652 --> 08:07.377
You know,
it's actually been proven

08:07.395 --> 08:09.062
that owning
and taking care of cats

08:09.231 --> 08:11.973
is 4,000 times harder than
being a mom to a human.

08:12.067 --> 08:14.659
-Did your cats
get you a present?
-Not yet.

08:14.811 --> 08:16.569
Maybe they're just waiting
for the right moment

08:16.771 --> 08:20.147
and tonight you're gonna find
like 50 dead birds in your bed.

08:20.167 --> 08:22.075
(gasps) Can you imagine?

08:22.227 --> 08:25.729
<i> LINDA:</i>
<i> Okay, you didn't like</i>
<i> the wacky broom idea</i>

08:25.747 --> 08:27.321
-where the cards were
the end of the wacky broom.
-Nope.

08:27.341 --> 08:29.082
You didn't like
the giant eyebrow idea

08:29.234 --> 08:31.751
where the cards were
a giant eyebrow over an eye.

08:31.903 --> 08:33.845
-Terrifying.
-But what about this?

08:33.997 --> 08:36.348
I present to you long hair lady.

08:36.499 --> 08:38.908
-(groans) That hair is long.
-You like it?

08:38.927 --> 08:41.094
I like it.
I just think it's also bad.

08:41.230 --> 08:42.912
Oh, I got one.
I just thought of one.

08:42.931 --> 08:44.748
All right, hang on.
I'm coming around.

08:44.766 --> 08:46.082
(Bob panting)

08:46.175 --> 08:47.600
Okay, okay. Grabbing the chalk.

08:47.694 --> 08:51.104
Uh, you could make all the cards
look like an accordion.

08:51.256 --> 08:52.939
So it's like an accordion lady.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.533
A lady who plays the accordion?

08:54.760 --> 08:57.443
No, kind of like
a lady who<i> is</i> an accordion.

08:57.520 --> 08:58.945
-Oh.
-Huh.

08:59.097 --> 09:01.114
Came all the way out here
to do that, huh? (chuckles)

09:01.266 --> 09:03.433
Yeah. Oh, the burger's burning.

09:03.526 --> 09:05.043
I mean, not burning.
It-It's perfect.

09:05.270 --> 09:08.288
I'm just gonna, uh, run back
and see how perfect it is.

09:08.382 --> 09:09.289
(Bob panting)

09:09.441 --> 09:11.032
LOUISE:
Remember, everyone,

09:11.051 --> 09:12.717
no matter how awful
this Lorraine lady is,

09:12.944 --> 09:15.369
we got to stick to the plan:
kill her with kindness.

09:15.389 --> 09:17.556
-I heard "kill."
-No, no, no. Kindness.

09:17.632 --> 09:20.374
Right. But also,
what if we just start, like,

09:20.394 --> 09:22.561
a little tiny fire in her house?

09:22.712 --> 09:24.454
-Aunt Gayle, no.
-Oh, hi.

09:24.547 --> 09:26.973
Uh, we are looking for
a Lorraine Parcone.

09:27.125 --> 09:28.958
Would the Lorraine
of the house be home?

09:29.127 --> 09:31.236
She is not. But I am her son.

09:31.387 --> 09:33.554
I'm Nico.
Uh, who are all of you?

09:33.632 --> 09:34.964
Oh, I'm Louise.

09:35.133 --> 09:36.633
This is my brother Gene
and my sister Tina.

09:36.802 --> 09:39.986
And we're... (imitates drumroll)
your cousins!

09:40.138 --> 09:41.638
Well, third cousins. I think.

09:41.656 --> 09:45.141
-So we're totally fine to marry.
-And we're not enemies at all.

09:45.143 --> 09:46.418
Oh. Okay, great.

09:46.569 --> 09:48.828
And you must be
their mom-slash-also my cousin?

09:48.922 --> 09:50.830
-Happy Mother's Day.
-Oh, right.

09:50.924 --> 09:52.816
I-I am their mother. Yes.

09:52.834 --> 09:53.983
That is what I am.

09:53.985 --> 09:55.985
I'm Linda, the homelier one.

09:56.079 --> 09:57.837
Gayle, my sister,
is a trial lawyer

09:57.989 --> 09:59.989
and a model
for a bikini corporation.

10:00.083 --> 10:02.249
Okay. Well, come on in.

10:02.344 --> 10:03.660
My mom should be back soon.

10:03.678 --> 10:05.252
She went out
to pick up some groceries.

10:05.272 --> 10:06.771
That's a fun
Mother's Day errand.

10:06.998 --> 10:08.848
So, what brings you all
here today?

10:09.000 --> 10:10.257
Such a good question.

10:10.352 --> 10:12.502
We were in the area
and thought we'd drop by

10:12.595 --> 10:14.504
and meet some cousins
and just visit.

10:14.597 --> 10:17.340
-We don't want anything
from you!
-So, how are we related exactly?

10:17.359 --> 10:19.117
You're not from
my great-great-uncle Tony's

10:19.194 --> 10:20.526
side of the family, are you?

10:20.679 --> 10:21.769
(nervous chuckling)

10:21.938 --> 10:24.605
Is what my mother would ask
if she were here.

10:24.625 --> 10:26.291
But I don't care. I'm just
glad to meet some cousins.

10:26.460 --> 10:28.943
Can I call you "cuz"?
Everybody okay with "cuz"?

10:28.962 --> 10:30.128
Abso-cuz-lutely.

10:30.279 --> 10:31.463
Hey, you don't have
a few minutes

10:31.690 --> 10:33.706
to bust out the photo albums
or, I don't know,

10:33.800 --> 10:37.694
old family recipes and just sit
around and get into it, do you?

10:37.712 --> 10:40.697
Well, the paint's got to dry
on my Buckaroo Banzai figurine.

10:40.715 --> 10:42.474
Buckaroo Banzai?
Buckaroo Banzai? No?

10:42.625 --> 10:44.367
Uh, I'll tell you about it.
Let's go.

10:44.460 --> 10:46.035
(quietly):
You guys, this is gonna be

10:46.129 --> 10:48.705
easier than I thought,
but we have to get the recipe

10:48.723 --> 10:49.889
before Lorraine gets home.

10:49.983 --> 10:51.708
Aunt Gayle, why did you say
you were our mom?

10:51.726 --> 10:53.393
I don't know. It just came out.

10:53.545 --> 10:55.545
But hold my hand and call me Mom
and let me give you advice.

10:55.638 --> 10:57.489
You should part your hair
in the middle.

10:57.640 --> 10:59.883
-No, I don't want to do that.
-You're grounded.

10:59.901 --> 11:01.642
Okay, here we go.

11:01.662 --> 11:03.978
It's a lady with long hair
driving a race car.

11:03.997 --> 11:05.646
Looks like she's in a bathtub.

11:05.740 --> 11:08.057
-Does your mom like race cars?
-Everyone likes race cars.

11:08.076 --> 11:11.060
Everyone likes baths.
It could just be a bathtub.

11:11.079 --> 11:12.729
Or she could have
no tattoo there,

11:12.747 --> 11:14.155
which was my original present!

11:14.174 --> 11:15.823
Hey, speaking of
Mother's Day presents,

11:15.842 --> 11:17.417
the kids have been gone
for a while.

11:17.569 --> 11:18.735
Are you really not gonna tell me

11:18.753 --> 11:21.087
where Gayle took them
to get my gift? Come on!

11:21.256 --> 11:23.515
I'm not gonna tell you.
It's a surprise.

11:23.666 --> 11:24.683
(gasps) Is it Vermont?

11:24.834 --> 11:26.075
-What?
-Did they drive up to Vermont

11:26.169 --> 11:27.260
to get me a blanket?

11:27.354 --> 11:28.928
I bet Vermont
has great blankets.

11:29.097 --> 11:30.413
(chuckles) That-- No.

11:30.415 --> 11:32.506
I can tell you
that they're not doing that.

11:32.526 --> 11:34.434
Now I know it's not a blanket.
Good job, Bob.

11:34.586 --> 11:36.769
Okay, I went with
the bathtub thing.

11:36.863 --> 11:37.862
I gave her a bar of soap.

11:38.031 --> 11:39.197
Why does the bathtub
have wheels?

11:39.424 --> 11:40.848
'Cause it was a race car!

11:40.942 --> 11:42.425
NICO:
And here's
my grandpa Joey again.

11:42.518 --> 11:43.943
This is when he started
sitting a lot.

11:44.037 --> 11:45.203
Wow. I love these pictures.

11:45.430 --> 11:46.779
But do you know
what I also love?

11:46.932 --> 11:49.356
Written stuff:
letters, laundry lists,

11:49.451 --> 11:51.267
lists of ingredients
or something.

11:51.360 --> 11:53.044
Ooh, there's another album.
I know where it is.

11:53.271 --> 11:54.604
I think there are
a couple of pictures

11:54.697 --> 11:55.880
of Grandpa Joey standing
in that one.

11:56.032 --> 11:57.698
We got to find that recipe
and get out of here.

11:57.718 --> 12:00.126
I'm gonna move that stool over
and check on top of the fridge.

12:00.220 --> 12:01.461
I see some cookbooks.

12:01.613 --> 12:03.370
Tina, help me.
Gayle, what are you doing?

12:03.390 --> 12:05.056
I'm gonna scratch
Joey's eyes out.

12:05.283 --> 12:07.892
-Nope, nope.
-Don't talk to your mother
that way.

12:08.044 --> 12:10.803
Ooh, recipe box. Recipe box.

12:10.897 --> 12:12.288
Flipping through.

12:12.381 --> 12:14.474
-Wait. Lasagna.
-We're not looking for lasagna.

12:14.626 --> 12:17.218
-Maybe it's looking for us.
-He's coming back.

12:17.295 --> 12:18.795
-Give it to me.
-No, no, no.

12:18.888 --> 12:20.721
Well, look at that. I<i> can</i>
move this stool. (chuckles)

12:20.890 --> 12:23.074
-Oh, hey, cuz.
-Look what I got.

12:23.226 --> 12:24.801
-Ooh, I think Mom's home.
-Oh, no.

12:24.819 --> 12:27.487
-Do I look like I've been
trying to find a job?
-So much.

12:27.639 --> 12:30.231
Nico, who's in my spot?
Ugly little car.

12:30.325 --> 12:31.824
Crap, crap, crap. What do we do?

12:31.977 --> 12:33.567
Ah. Who are you people?

12:33.587 --> 12:36.546
Run! I mean, hey, you.

12:40.093 --> 12:41.985
-Wait, who are they?
-They're our cousins.

12:42.078 --> 12:44.821
Yeah, Gene, Tina and me, Louise.

12:44.839 --> 12:47.490
And Linda.
We were just headed out.

12:47.492 --> 12:50.251
Yup, we're taking our mom
to get washed.

12:50.312 --> 12:51.936
-A brunch and wash.
-I'm filthy.

12:52.163 --> 12:54.163
Nico, you have been
nothing but delightful.

12:54.257 --> 12:56.107
Lorraine,
incredible to meet you.

12:56.334 --> 12:58.167
-Are we hugging? I can't tell.
-Wait.

12:58.261 --> 12:59.685
Did you say your name was Linda?

12:59.838 --> 13:02.280
Yes. And these are
my three beautiful children

13:02.431 --> 13:04.115
that I home-birthed
while watching TV

13:04.267 --> 13:07.285
because birth isn't as hard as
people are always saying it is.

13:07.512 --> 13:10.013
(gasps)
So you're Gloria's daughter?

13:10.106 --> 13:11.772
I am. And that's really true.

13:11.866 --> 13:14.626
Nico, do you realize
what you've done?

13:14.853 --> 13:15.852
Uh, no.

13:15.945 --> 13:18.279
You've let the foxes
into the henhouse.

13:18.298 --> 13:20.023
You've invited
the blood of Tonys

13:20.041 --> 13:22.542
-into this house of
the blood of Joeys!
-Ah!

13:22.694 --> 13:25.637
So, we know there's
some history in our family,

13:25.788 --> 13:27.454
but we swear, we come in peace.

13:27.474 --> 13:30.216
The same way
Tony came to dinner in peace

13:30.310 --> 13:33.311
all those years ago
and forked my grandfather?

13:33.538 --> 13:36.222
The same way your Grandma Gloria
came in peace

13:36.374 --> 13:37.798
when she poured punch
down my back

13:37.892 --> 13:39.892
at her wedding
and then punched me?

13:40.045 --> 13:42.045
Well, we should go
move that ugly car.

13:42.063 --> 13:43.713
You're not leaving.
Why'd you come here?

13:43.731 --> 13:45.990
-What did you do?
-(sighs) Here's the thing.

13:46.067 --> 13:47.550
We actually came here to say

13:47.569 --> 13:50.495
-we think your side is right.
-What?

13:50.664 --> 13:51.979
-What? Ow.
-Yeah.

13:51.998 --> 13:53.164
That's why we're really here.

13:53.333 --> 13:55.149
To tell you
that our side of the family

13:55.168 --> 13:57.818
is dumb and stabby and bad.

13:57.896 --> 13:58.837
-Really?
-Okay.

13:58.988 --> 14:00.063
Really. Right, guys?

14:00.156 --> 14:01.397
It's not easy being a Tony.

14:01.416 --> 14:03.399
Oh, man, yeah.
"Be a Tony," they said.

14:03.418 --> 14:05.343
"It'll be easy," they said.

14:05.494 --> 14:06.511
Well, it's not!

14:06.662 --> 14:08.495
Yeah, it's the worst. Ugh!

14:08.515 --> 14:12.033
Even our, uh, mom agrees.
Right, Mommy?

14:12.093 --> 14:13.334
Yes, I do.

14:13.353 --> 14:15.411
Well, you're right.
They're the worst.

14:15.430 --> 14:18.172
But I guess it's not your fault
you come from garbage.

14:18.266 --> 14:19.340
(Gayle growls)

14:19.434 --> 14:21.267
Hey, I got a rotisserie chicken
for Nico.

14:21.419 --> 14:23.027
Uh, he eats so many chickens.

14:23.104 --> 14:24.529
And I have Sprite.
You like Sprite?

14:24.714 --> 14:27.090
You want to stay for some Sprite
and some chicken? Huh?

14:27.108 --> 14:28.591
Oh, we should really get going.

14:28.684 --> 14:31.369
-It's Sprite
and chicken time, baby!
-Gene.

14:31.596 --> 14:33.538
Mom, do we really have
to give them my chicken?

14:33.765 --> 14:35.689
Yes, Nico!
You're sharing your chicken.

14:35.767 --> 14:37.709
<i> -(phone chimes)</i>
<i> -TEDDY: Oh, that's Mom.</i>

14:37.860 --> 14:40.269
She said she's sorry
it took so long to respond.

14:40.363 --> 14:41.771
She was at an estate sale

14:41.789 --> 14:43.439
and she got
some really good Rollerblades.

14:43.532 --> 14:45.699
Oh! She likes
the long hair bathtub lady.

14:45.719 --> 14:47.385
-Okay. With the wheels?
-(phone chimes)

14:47.462 --> 14:50.446
Wait. She said she needs
to "see it on skin."

14:50.465 --> 14:52.798
Mom, just draw it
right on your thigh.

14:52.893 --> 14:55.376
-(phone chimes)
-She says she can't.
She's rollerblading.

14:55.453 --> 14:56.469
Ooh, Teddy.

14:56.563 --> 14:58.545
We draw it on your thigh
and send a picture.

14:58.565 --> 15:00.732
My thighs are just a tiny bit
hairier than my mom's.

15:00.959 --> 15:04.569
Okay. So we do it on your back
and pretend it's a thigh?

15:04.720 --> 15:07.130
-Eh, I-I-I don't know.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:07.148 --> 15:09.223
-Take your shirt off.
-Okay.

15:09.317 --> 15:10.650
H-He'll-He'll put
his shirt back on soon.

15:10.802 --> 15:11.409
Enjoy your burger.

15:11.560 --> 15:13.578
Sorry it's not home-cooked.

15:13.729 --> 15:16.230
And it's not that warm
and the soda's not cold.

15:16.399 --> 15:18.399
I'll never eat chicken
any other way.

15:18.493 --> 15:20.143
I can't believe you gave them
the drumsticks.

15:20.161 --> 15:22.311
Hush! Guests get the drumsticks!

15:22.330 --> 15:23.496
Well, that was delicious.

15:23.572 --> 15:24.923
Got to save some room
for brunch, though.

15:25.091 --> 15:26.257
Right, everybody?

15:26.409 --> 15:28.242
Yes, let's leave.
I'll take my fanny pack.

15:28.261 --> 15:30.153
-I'll take my chicken.
-Okay, bye.

15:30.246 --> 15:31.671
No, no. Don't go yet.

15:31.765 --> 15:33.264
We're having such a nice visit,

15:33.416 --> 15:36.159
and you were gonna say bad stuff
about your grandparents.

15:36.177 --> 15:37.493
Sit, sit, sit.

15:37.512 --> 15:38.844
-Okay.
-Sure.

15:39.013 --> 15:40.163
Can someone please pass
the chicken?

15:40.181 --> 15:42.181
So, Grandma Gloria. Yuck, right?

15:42.333 --> 15:43.441
-Oh, yuck. Yeah.
-Ugh. The worst.

15:43.668 --> 15:45.276
-Right, Mom?
-GAYLE: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

15:45.503 --> 15:47.779
Yeah, I didn't have another
dress to wear to her wedding,

15:47.930 --> 15:51.098
so I wore my wedding dress,
and somehow I'm the bad guy?

15:51.117 --> 15:52.116
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

15:52.268 --> 15:53.451
Linda, have some chicken.

15:53.678 --> 15:55.695
-I don't want chicken.
-I'll have some chicken.

15:55.847 --> 15:58.364
Ah! And that voice.
Everyone on that side.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.625
Linda, you are lucky
you didn't get it.

16:00.776 --> 16:02.109
-Mm-hmm.
-Have some chicken.

16:02.278 --> 16:04.370
-I'd like the chicken.
-Ah, those people make me sick.

16:04.464 --> 16:05.946
Linda, seriously,
have some chicken.

16:06.040 --> 16:08.132
-You don't like chicken?
-Fine, I'll get it myself.

16:08.284 --> 16:09.542
All right,
I'll have some chicken!

16:09.694 --> 16:10.635
-Ow!
-(gasps)

16:10.862 --> 16:13.120
Did you just stab
my sweet baby boy Nico?

16:13.214 --> 16:14.213
It was an accident.

16:14.365 --> 16:15.640
I just wanted some chicken.

16:15.791 --> 16:17.458
-Okay, gosh, look at the time.
-Bye-bye.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.811
Oh, I dropped my fork that I
didn't stab you on purpose with.

16:20.038 --> 16:21.187
I'll pick it up.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.131
-LOUISE: Oh, no.
-GENE: Uh-oh.
-TINA: Oh, God.

16:24.209 --> 16:25.708
Wait! Is that my recipe box?

16:25.801 --> 16:28.878
-You stole my recipes?
-You can't prove anything.

16:28.971 --> 16:31.030
Well, this has
just been delightful.

16:34.569 --> 16:36.719
Of course you Tonys
come in our home,

16:36.812 --> 16:40.556
fork my boy
and try to steal my recipes.

16:40.649 --> 16:41.648
They ate my drumsticks.

16:41.668 --> 16:44.168
Okay, yes, we did
all of those things.

16:44.395 --> 16:47.154
No matter how much
we told someone to be cool.

16:47.248 --> 16:48.564
It was an accident, sort of.

16:48.657 --> 16:50.341
But, listen,
we wanted to give our mom

16:50.418 --> 16:51.901
something special
for Mother's Day.

16:51.994 --> 16:53.586
-The brunch and wash?
-No, the recipe

16:53.755 --> 16:56.572
for her great-grandma Maria's
Bolognese sauce.

16:56.665 --> 16:58.074
And that's the whole truth.

16:58.167 --> 16:59.684
-Well, she's also not our mom.
-Right. Good point.

16:59.911 --> 17:01.853
I'm Linda's
brilliant sister Gayle.

17:02.004 --> 17:03.187
So now that's the whole truth.

17:03.414 --> 17:05.005
Also, I haven't brushed my teeth
in four weeks.

17:05.099 --> 17:06.340
There, that's it!

17:06.359 --> 17:08.084
Why would you think
I would have that recipe?

17:08.102 --> 17:10.177
Because you're no-good Joeys?

17:10.196 --> 17:11.604
We don't have it. The Tonys do.

17:11.756 --> 17:13.531
One of you took it
when you were going through

17:13.682 --> 17:16.034
Grandma Maria's stuff in
her basement after she passed.

17:16.185 --> 17:17.851
And you won't share it with us!

17:17.871 --> 17:19.353
-Liar!
-Ugh, now I'm hearing

17:19.372 --> 17:20.705
Gloria's voice in there.
(groans)

17:20.932 --> 17:23.207
Lorraine, our family doesn't
have the recipe. We swear.

17:23.434 --> 17:24.876
It's why we came all the way
to your house today.

17:25.027 --> 17:26.527
And to hang with this guy.
Am I right?

17:26.621 --> 17:28.546
We just wanted to do it
for our mom-- our real mom.

17:28.773 --> 17:31.290
She said that sauce reminds her
of her Grandma Claudia,

17:31.367 --> 17:32.775
who she was missing today,

17:32.868 --> 17:34.944
and she said she wished
she could taste it again.

17:34.962 --> 17:36.554
Huh. All these years,
Tony's side thought

17:36.723 --> 17:39.632
Joey's side had it, and Joey's
side thought Tony's side had it.

17:39.801 --> 17:41.392
And after
the totally understandable

17:41.544 --> 17:43.302
-wedding dress incident...
-I mean...

17:43.454 --> 17:45.045
...no one's talking
to each other.

17:45.065 --> 17:47.231
And we all think the other side
is having Nana Maria's

17:47.383 --> 17:49.216
incredible Bolognese
for dinner every night.

17:49.310 --> 17:51.218
But no one was
Bolog-nosey enough

17:51.312 --> 17:53.237
to come after the recipe
until us.

17:53.464 --> 17:55.907
The rest of Nana's stuff
went off on a truck to Goodwill.

17:56.058 --> 17:58.801
Some stranger's making
great sauce right now.

17:58.803 --> 18:01.412
-And Tina's making another card.
-Damn it.

18:01.564 --> 18:03.806
LINDA: I really think
it came out great.

18:03.825 --> 18:05.641
Y-You know you can
put your shirt back on, right?

18:05.734 --> 18:08.235
Uh, I just want to let
the tat breathe a little.

18:08.254 --> 18:10.146
-It's still pretty raw.
-It's pen, Teddy.

18:10.164 --> 18:11.997
Yeah, but she pressed
really hard.

18:12.150 --> 18:13.424
-(phone chimes)
-Oh, here we go.

18:13.576 --> 18:16.152
Mom says, "On second thought,
I don't think it works."

18:16.245 --> 18:17.428
-Crap.
-I guess it's back to

18:17.655 --> 18:19.580
paying to have
her tattoo removed.

18:19.599 --> 18:21.432
I might have to sell my truck,
but that's okay.

18:21.601 --> 18:24.251
I can bike my tools
and ladders around. Or scooter.

18:24.345 --> 18:26.011
Wait. Teddy, this is crazy.

18:26.164 --> 18:27.680
Your mom loved gin rummy enough

18:27.832 --> 18:29.682
to get a tattoo of it
on her upper, upper thigh.

18:29.834 --> 18:31.776
Well, do you want to know
what's cheaper than

18:31.927 --> 18:32.944
getting a tattoo removed?

18:33.095 --> 18:34.595
Your mom calling
her card buddies

18:34.614 --> 18:37.173
and telling them she's sorry
for being such a rummy crumbum

18:37.266 --> 18:38.599
that they kicked her
out of the group.

18:38.676 --> 18:40.359
You think she should try
to patch things up

18:40.453 --> 18:42.436
-with the Rum Runners?
-Yes, Teddy, I do.

18:42.530 --> 18:44.347
Funny, coming from the lady
with the family feud

18:44.365 --> 18:45.939
that's three generations long.

18:45.959 --> 18:48.126
-It's Mother's Day. Shush.
-Yup. Sorry.

18:48.277 --> 18:49.627
I'm gonna call her.

18:49.778 --> 18:50.777
Ma?! What?!

18:50.797 --> 18:52.204
-Teddy, you're shouting.
-Ma?!

18:52.357 --> 18:53.297
-I can't...
-Teddy.

18:53.524 --> 18:54.857
Bob, I'm gonna
take this outside.

18:54.950 --> 18:56.283
It's too loud in here.

18:56.302 --> 18:58.118
-Ma?! Ma?!
-Ooh, there they are.

18:58.212 --> 18:59.712
-Hey, kids. Ma?!
-Hi, Gayle.

18:59.806 --> 19:02.365
Does some lucky mom have
a sweet Mother's Day present

19:02.458 --> 19:03.699
coming her way?

19:03.718 --> 19:05.868
We wanted to get you something
really special,

19:05.961 --> 19:07.294
but we kind of failed.

19:07.313 --> 19:09.054
Turns out
we weren't too big to fail.

19:09.149 --> 19:10.481
Wait, what were you kids
trying to get me?

19:10.633 --> 19:12.892
Your great-grandmother's
Bolognese recipe

19:12.968 --> 19:14.819
that Grandma Claudia
used to make for you.

19:14.896 --> 19:18.564
Oh, my God! I'm gonna cry.
(sobs)

19:18.716 --> 19:19.824
That's so sweet. (sniffles)

19:20.017 --> 19:22.568
Oh, snot's coming out.
Snot's coming out.

19:22.720 --> 19:24.478
How would you even get that?

19:24.497 --> 19:26.405
Aunt Gayle took us
to your cousin Lorraine's house.

19:26.557 --> 19:28.649
-What?
-In my car
that I know how to drive.

19:28.743 --> 19:30.484
-She wouldn't give you
the recipe, huh?
-TINA: No.

19:30.503 --> 19:32.170
She couldn't give us
the recipe because

19:32.321 --> 19:34.154
she doesn't have the recipe.
No one does.

19:34.248 --> 19:35.731
Wait, what? Wh-What do you mean?

19:35.824 --> 19:37.491
Great-Uncle Joey never had it.

19:37.510 --> 19:39.235
They thought our side
of the family took it.

19:39.237 --> 19:41.904
Wait, so the Joeys
aren't recipe stealers?

19:41.997 --> 19:44.515
-It's just gone?
-It's sauced in translation.

19:44.701 --> 19:46.851
And you know what?
I'm just gonna say it.

19:47.002 --> 19:48.427
This feud is dumb.

19:48.579 --> 19:50.504
Somebody bought a house, and
then somebody forked somebody,

19:50.523 --> 19:52.857
like, forever ago, and everyone
should just get over it.

19:53.008 --> 19:56.176
People get forked every day
and move on with their lives.

19:56.196 --> 19:57.920
I forked Nico today.

19:58.013 --> 20:00.272
I mean, what-- We're supposed
to be the idiot kids.

20:00.366 --> 20:01.941
Why do we have to tell you
all this crap?

20:02.035 --> 20:03.517
Yeah, Mom, grow up! Uh, sorry.

20:03.594 --> 20:06.262
Wow. Don't really like
that smart-mouth attitude,

20:06.280 --> 20:07.446
but maybe you're right.

20:07.598 --> 20:10.023
Maybe it's time to start
putting feuds behind us.

20:10.117 --> 20:11.542
Gin rummy feuds, family feuds...

20:11.694 --> 20:14.712
Yeah, I was kind of the one
who pointed that out earlier.

20:14.863 --> 20:17.456
-It's Mother's Day!
-(door opens)

20:17.608 --> 20:19.475
Well, she wasn't crazy about
the apology idea,

20:19.477 --> 20:21.201
but she said
maybe she'll hold off

20:21.221 --> 20:22.461
on getting the tattoo removed.

20:22.630 --> 20:24.371
She told me to just
take her someplace nice

20:24.465 --> 20:26.966
for a baked potato
and then call it a Mother's Day.

20:27.118 --> 20:28.133
Ooh, baked potato.

20:28.286 --> 20:29.301
Well, we're sorry
we couldn't get you

20:29.454 --> 20:30.636
your family's sauce recipe.

20:30.730 --> 20:32.379
But we made you this card
on the way home.

20:32.398 --> 20:35.458
It says "Moth-er's Day,"
and I drew you as a moth.

20:35.626 --> 20:36.308
That'd be a good tattoo.

20:36.461 --> 20:38.477
Aw. You kids are incredible,

20:38.629 --> 20:39.812
and you acted so grown-up today.

20:39.964 --> 20:41.555
Trying to end
a bitter family feud.

20:41.574 --> 20:44.300
And I made you that way, so I'm,
like, the best mom in the world.

20:44.393 --> 20:46.410
Now come here, my little babies.
I love you so much.

20:46.562 --> 20:48.137
Hey, maybe we should have
Lorraine and Nico

20:48.230 --> 20:49.321
over for dinner sometime.

20:49.474 --> 20:51.307
-We owe him some chicken.
-Okay, fine.

20:51.325 --> 20:52.899
-But then we can prank them.
-Yeah.

20:52.994 --> 20:54.234
I'll hide a fork in my sock.

20:54.254 --> 20:55.811
Fork both of them
when they're not looking,

20:55.830 --> 20:57.313
-as a fun joke.
-Yeah, yeah.
