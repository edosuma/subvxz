WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:04.439
I can't believe they did that
to you. You're a great nurse.

00:04.440 --> 00:07.279
Anything you ever need from me,
then it's yours.

00:07.280 --> 00:11.239
This programme contains
some strong language

00:11.240 --> 00:13.199
Hi, Dad. Cathy.

00:13.200 --> 00:14.599
Yeah!

00:14.600 --> 00:15.839
You always were a good girl.

00:15.840 --> 00:17.840
I'm going to be a doctor.

00:19.760 --> 00:21.439
I know I'm good enough.

00:21.440 --> 00:24.240
Are you sure you want to work here?
Very much.

00:25.960 --> 00:27.880
There's got to be a catch here.

00:29.600 --> 00:31.439
I'm not a real doctor.

00:31.440 --> 00:33.240
Oh, because you're a woman?

00:34.960 --> 00:36.439
Sam Kelly, Sheffield Express?

00:36.440 --> 00:38.599
I don't want to talk to you.
Don't call me again.

00:38.600 --> 00:39.679
Cath!

00:39.680 --> 00:42.439
Karl has no idea where you are,
does he? Did he hit you?

00:42.440 --> 00:45.639
I need this whole thing
to be a new start for us.

00:45.640 --> 00:47.119
Daddy!

00:47.120 --> 00:48.719
They've got a depot up there.

00:48.720 --> 00:50.039
Edinburgh.

00:50.040 --> 00:52.000
One step at a time.

00:55.760 --> 00:57.439
Oh, sorry.

00:57.440 --> 00:59.159
So when were you
planning on telling me?

00:59.160 --> 01:01.280
About you and Dr Perfect.

01:03.120 --> 01:05.639
You know, you don't
actually need to buy somewhere.

01:05.640 --> 01:06.999
I've got a flat.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.560
You don't know me.

01:11.720 --> 01:13.879
Can I speak Ms Hardacre, please?

01:13.880 --> 01:15.239
Sorry?

01:15.240 --> 01:17.799
Is it possible to speak to Cath,
please?

01:17.800 --> 01:18.959
Who?

01:18.960 --> 01:21.919
My dad's ill. He's on his way to
hospital. The ambulance just left.

01:21.920 --> 01:23.440
I need to go.

01:25.000 --> 01:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:01.840 --> 02:03.000
Ta.

02:07.800 --> 02:10.199
Which one? Hey?

02:10.199 --> 02:12.840
Er, five. Thanks.

02:55.080 --> 02:56.200
Dad?

02:58.200 --> 02:59.920
I'm here, Dad.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.480
I brought Molly.

03:03.480 --> 03:06.599
He's asleep. We shouldn't wake him.

03:06.600 --> 03:08.759
No, we shouldn't.

03:08.760 --> 03:11.120
You sit down here, sweetheart.

04:00.400 --> 04:02.519
Presumed urinary sepsis,

04:02.520 --> 04:06.159
bloods last checked on Friday.
Recent productive cough.

04:06.160 --> 04:07.559
But otherwise, in status quo.

04:07.560 --> 04:09.279
DNAR? It's in the notes.

04:09.280 --> 04:11.999
Good. Hiya. I'm his daughter.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.679
Amira Shah. I've been
taking care of your father.

04:14.680 --> 04:16.759
We were just discussing
his treatment.

04:16.760 --> 04:19.839
We think he may have had a
urinary tract infection. However...

04:19.839 --> 04:22.319
Actually, I'm more concerned about
his sodium levels.

04:22.320 --> 04:24.079
And his lungs sound congested.

04:24.080 --> 04:25.879
When was the last time
he had a chest X-ray?

04:25.880 --> 04:28.079
Perhaps it will be best
if you stepped outside.

04:28.080 --> 04:29.479
It's fine, Sister.

04:29.480 --> 04:31.559
We should speak privately, Miss...

04:31.560 --> 04:33.919
Cath. Cath Hardacre.

04:33.920 --> 04:35.119
Do you mind?

04:35.120 --> 04:36.239
No.

04:36.240 --> 04:38.959
You're medical? Nurse.

04:38.960 --> 04:41.839
Ward sister. Well, used to be.

04:41.840 --> 04:45.199
I see. Then I suspect
you understand where we are?

04:45.200 --> 04:47.559
Your father's dying,
Sister Hardacre.

04:47.560 --> 04:51.679
We treated his urinary infection
but now he has pneumonia.

04:51.680 --> 04:56.439
That on a background of Parkinson's
with severe associated dementia.

04:56.440 --> 04:58.199
He was a proud man, I understand?

04:58.200 --> 04:59.839
He still is.

04:59.840 --> 05:01.640
You're right to correct me.

05:02.720 --> 05:06.240
Be his daughter, Sister Hardacre,
not his nurse.

06:35.040 --> 06:38.159
Porters are here, lovey.
Can they come in?

06:38.160 --> 06:39.359
Yeah.

06:39.360 --> 06:40.520
OK.

06:41.960 --> 06:46.199
If you need to ring anyone, you can
use the ward phone. Family?

06:46.200 --> 06:48.399
Thanks. It's fine.

06:48.400 --> 06:50.600
It's just me now.

07:27.320 --> 07:31.440
Hiya. It's Andy Brenner. We met
at the Cardiff conference last year.

07:32.640 --> 07:35.839
Yeah, yeah, good, thanks. I just
wanted to chase up a reference.

07:35.840 --> 07:38.920
A Dr Alison Sutton?
She worked for you?

07:52.440 --> 07:55.600
You're quite sure
she definitely left the country?

07:58.560 --> 08:00.640
No chance she changed her mind?

08:07.360 --> 08:09.520
OK. No, must be my mistake.

08:11.240 --> 08:13.400
Thanks for your time. Thanks.

08:34.200 --> 08:35.719
Shit!

08:35.720 --> 08:36.919
Ooh! Sorry.

08:36.919 --> 08:38.119
Are you OK? Sorry!

08:38.120 --> 08:39.320
What a dick!

09:04.200 --> 09:05.799
Hey.

09:05.800 --> 09:08.479
You all right? What's happening?

09:08.480 --> 09:09.999
He died about an hour ago.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.439
They're just dealing with... you
know, they're dealing with the...

09:13.440 --> 09:15.080
I'm so sorry.

09:16.520 --> 09:18.479
Are you all right?

09:18.480 --> 09:19.879
I'm going to need a few days.

09:19.880 --> 09:22.040
The funeral, arrangements...

09:23.320 --> 09:27.240
Oh, of course, of course.
Er, I can let people know.

09:29.080 --> 09:30.799
How's Molly?

09:30.800 --> 09:34.839
OK. She's being spoilt
by some nurse somewhere.

09:34.840 --> 09:36.760
I don't think she gets it.

09:37.880 --> 09:40.960
Either that or I've
given birth to a psychopath.

09:52.040 --> 09:54.760
Just take as long as you need.

09:55.920 --> 09:58.680
OK? OK. Thanks.

10:02.320 --> 10:04.359
I'll talk to you tonight.

10:04.360 --> 10:05.720
Bye.

10:24.800 --> 10:26.799
It's gone down again!

10:26.800 --> 10:28.719
Something to do with
a sodding attachment.

10:28.720 --> 10:30.359
And do you know,
I've got 20 letters

10:30.360 --> 10:33.639
I have to get out before one, and I cannot
bear to speak to that IT hobbit again.

10:33.640 --> 10:36.520
There's something
I need to talk to you about.

10:38.520 --> 10:40.160
It's about Ally.

10:45.080 --> 10:48.319
The good news is there's
no plan for a postmortem.

10:48.320 --> 10:50.439
Dr Shah has signed
the certificate

10:50.440 --> 10:53.279
so we can release the body
straight away.

10:53.280 --> 10:55.039
Do you have a preference?

10:55.040 --> 10:56.399
Sorry?

10:56.400 --> 10:58.279
For the funeral director?

10:58.280 --> 11:01.079
Some people like to plan ahead.

11:01.080 --> 11:02.920
Not really. I've been away.

11:05.840 --> 11:10.639
They're very good. Mid-price.
And won't keep you waiting.

11:10.640 --> 11:13.000
I know his sister from bingo.

11:14.200 --> 11:15.720
Thank you.

11:17.840 --> 11:20.560
Hey. Hey, chicken.

11:22.080 --> 11:23.480
Are you OK?

11:25.920 --> 11:27.239
What a shame!

11:27.240 --> 11:29.039
Mm. Were they close?

11:29.040 --> 11:31.959
Er, I'm not sure.
She got a call last night.

11:31.960 --> 11:36.160
I think he'd been sick for a while.
Parkinson's, dementia.

11:37.280 --> 11:39.999
OK, I'll ask Gemma
to organise some flowers.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.119
I'll let staffing know,

11:41.120 --> 11:43.359
and see if they can
dig in their pockets for a locum.

11:43.360 --> 11:46.399
Oh, I think Sue might be
back in the country now.

11:46.400 --> 11:48.319
There we go. Oh!

11:48.320 --> 11:49.640
Thank you!

11:54.480 --> 11:55.839
What do you think of her?

11:55.840 --> 11:57.479
What, Sue?

11:57.480 --> 11:59.880
I think she does her best.
No, no, I mean Ally.

12:01.360 --> 12:02.919
I'm interested.

12:02.920 --> 12:05.960
What, as a doctor or as a person?
Professionally.

12:07.680 --> 12:09.439
Has it been a problem?

12:09.440 --> 12:12.279
Ah, you've seen her work. I just
want to know what you think of her.

12:12.280 --> 12:14.519
Well, simple.
I think she's excellent.

12:14.520 --> 12:15.839
The nursing staff like her.

12:15.840 --> 12:19.439
And, frankly, I'm getting fat on
the amount of chocolate she gets.

12:19.440 --> 12:21.399
Why, has someone raised a concern?

12:21.400 --> 12:24.639
Er, no, no, it's nothing.
It's just, um...

12:24.640 --> 12:26.919
I just wanted to get your opinion
on her. As a doctor.

12:26.920 --> 12:28.359
What, out of the blue?

12:28.360 --> 12:30.199
On a wet Wednesday morning?

12:30.200 --> 12:32.959
Ah, she's due an official appraisal
so I thought I'd ask.

12:32.960 --> 12:34.279
OK. Honestly?

12:34.280 --> 12:38.719
I think that Dr Sutton is-is
far too good for the likes of us.

12:38.720 --> 12:42.159
And I, for one, am not going
to look a gift horse in the mouth.

12:42.160 --> 12:44.359
Don't you agree?

12:44.360 --> 12:50.080
Yeah. From what I've seen,
she seems very competent.

12:56.360 --> 12:57.759
Her references...

12:57.760 --> 12:59.079
Were excellent!

12:59.080 --> 13:02.639
Look, if your needy penis is going
to screw this whole situation up

13:02.640 --> 13:06.559
for all of us, then... then
I would encourage it to reconsider.

13:06.560 --> 13:08.000
Urgently.

13:12.880 --> 13:16.920
Arthur Hardacre
were a real unionist.

13:18.040 --> 13:20.040
A stalwart of the movement.

13:21.200 --> 13:26.999
An honest man who would not only
call a spade a bloody great shovel,

13:27.000 --> 13:30.999
but one who weren't shy
to pick it up and do a day's work

13:31.000 --> 13:32.800
if the situation so demanded.

13:36.440 --> 13:39.880
I were proud
to call Arthur my friend.

13:41.720 --> 13:43.800
What you saw were what you got.

13:45.080 --> 13:48.680
And what you got
were a bloody good man.

13:50.800 --> 13:52.760
We're a dying breed, right enough.

13:53.880 --> 13:55.200
But I remember.

13:57.400 --> 13:59.759
Here's to you, Arthur.

13:59.760 --> 14:01.200
Thank you.

14:02.440 --> 14:03.920
Look!

14:07.240 --> 14:10.240
Sorry. Hiya! You all right?
Yeah.

14:11.360 --> 14:13.199
Will you please stand?

14:13.200 --> 14:14.800
Come on, sweetheart.

14:46.240 --> 14:47.959
I didn't expect to see you.

14:47.960 --> 14:50.840
Well, right thing to do, isn't it?
Pay your respects.

14:52.120 --> 14:54.479
Not that he ever gave us
the time of day.

14:54.480 --> 14:56.239
True. You didn't exactly click.

14:56.240 --> 14:57.760
Your dad bloody hated me.

14:59.440 --> 15:00.760
Gave him reason to.

15:03.560 --> 15:04.999
You OK?

15:05.000 --> 15:07.559
It's for the best, isn't it?

15:07.560 --> 15:10.519
It's what everyone says.
Considering.

15:10.520 --> 15:12.359
You know, his condition.

15:12.360 --> 15:15.199
It was just me and him
for so long after my mum died.

15:15.200 --> 15:16.720
It was just us two.

15:18.760 --> 15:21.800
You know, he bought me tampons
when I started.

15:22.960 --> 15:24.239
You're joking?

15:24.240 --> 15:28.240
No! I was 12.
And he gave 'em to me like... urgh!

15:32.760 --> 15:37.079
Um... I've applied
for that transfer, at work.

15:37.080 --> 15:38.840
You know, depot in Edinburgh.

15:40.120 --> 15:42.679
It means I see more of Molly,
wouldn't have to travel.

15:42.680 --> 15:44.279
Makes sense.

15:44.280 --> 15:45.479
What did they say?

15:45.480 --> 15:46.879
Dale says it's a possibility.

15:46.880 --> 15:49.239
He's checking it out,
but it's looking good.

15:49.240 --> 15:51.679
Well, you still should
have discussed it with me first.

15:51.680 --> 15:54.079
I can't... I just don't want
it to go back to how it was!

15:54.080 --> 15:55.679
We won't. Look, it's all different.

15:55.680 --> 15:57.319
I haven't had a drink
in eight months.

15:57.320 --> 15:59.279
I know, but we've been here before!

15:59.280 --> 16:00.839
Not like this.

16:00.840 --> 16:03.839
You and me,
I-I know that's gone. Yeah?

16:03.840 --> 16:07.479
I've accepted that.
But Molly's still my kid.

16:07.480 --> 16:10.439
I-I just want to make it right,
you know? Contribute, too. Here.

16:10.440 --> 16:12.079
There's a couple of hundred there.

16:12.080 --> 16:14.879
I'm not taking your money!
It's for Molly.

16:14.880 --> 16:16.959
Back payment.

16:16.960 --> 16:18.240
Please!

16:21.920 --> 16:23.680
Deeds, not words, right?

16:26.160 --> 16:30.400
There we go. Now be good, OK?
Long way. I will.

16:31.760 --> 16:33.800
So I'll let you know what Dale says.

16:34.800 --> 16:36.120
OK, fine.

16:37.320 --> 16:39.519
See you later, munchkin. All right.

16:39.520 --> 16:40.960
Bye.

16:43.160 --> 16:44.800
Love you!

16:47.320 --> 16:49.400
Shall we go home? Yeah.

17:37.520 --> 17:40.799
I thought you were on leave.
Sucker for punishment.

17:40.800 --> 17:42.799
I heard. Your dad, wasn't it?

17:42.800 --> 17:45.119
I'm so sorry. Thanks,
but it's been coming a while.

17:45.120 --> 17:46.759
Yeah. So who's this?

17:46.760 --> 17:48.519
Annie Gilmarsh, brittle asthmatic.

17:48.520 --> 17:50.519
She's been getting worse
since about 5am.

17:50.520 --> 17:52.519
Usually takes Salbutamol
and Becotide.

17:52.520 --> 17:54.159
I'm Dr Sutton, Ally.

17:54.160 --> 17:56.079
I'm just going to have
a listen to your back,

17:56.080 --> 17:58.599
so if you take a deep breath for me,
please.

17:58.600 --> 18:00.000
And again.

18:01.200 --> 18:03.840
Thanks. So, if you'll just lay back,
I'll listen to your chest.

18:08.520 --> 18:12.039
Continue with back-to-back nebs
and 200 of hydrocortisone IV.

18:12.040 --> 18:14.599
It is like you're working with
Derren Brown.

18:14.600 --> 18:16.119
Just sign the dotted line.

18:16.120 --> 18:17.160
Ta.

18:19.760 --> 18:22.959
So he took you on the open-top
bus for a first date? Mm-hm.

18:22.960 --> 18:25.639
Brought along tuna sandwiches
and half a bottle of vodka.

18:25.640 --> 18:30.119
He told me he wanted to get to know
me and my city at the same time.

18:30.120 --> 18:31.999
Wow!

18:32.000 --> 18:33.159
Actually, that is smart.

18:33.160 --> 18:34.959
I think I'm going to write
that down. Ooh!

18:34.960 --> 18:37.799
How's the asthmatic?
Better already. Resp rate down.

18:37.800 --> 18:39.719
Great. I'll review her in a tick.

18:39.720 --> 18:41.520
Work to do. See you later, yeah?

18:44.960 --> 18:46.359
So?

18:46.360 --> 18:49.959
He's-he's cute. It's not serious.

18:49.960 --> 18:51.639
Look me in the eye and tell me that.

18:51.640 --> 18:53.799
It is not serious!

18:53.800 --> 18:56.600
Well, if he asks you to play
doctors and nurses, watch out.

18:57.800 --> 18:59.560
I think I already have.

19:21.800 --> 19:23.359
This is Annie, known asthmatic.

19:23.360 --> 19:25.319
She's been struggling
since this morning.

19:25.320 --> 19:26.639
Her X-ray looks OK.

19:26.640 --> 19:27.839
Her peak flow?

19:27.840 --> 19:29.839
Er, unrecordable.
Down 100 since this morning.

19:29.840 --> 19:30.919
And her expected?

19:30.920 --> 19:32.039
I can check.

19:32.040 --> 19:33.959
Any ITU admissions in the last year?

19:33.960 --> 19:35.279
Twice, about a week each time.

19:35.280 --> 19:37.439
Pneumothorax?

19:37.440 --> 19:38.720
Er...

19:40.480 --> 19:42.519
Well... couldn't see one.

19:42.520 --> 19:44.320
Yes or no?

19:46.600 --> 19:48.239
Yes or no?!

19:48.240 --> 19:50.520
Er... er...

19:55.320 --> 19:56.959
No.

19:56.960 --> 19:58.279
What are we treating her with?

19:58.280 --> 20:00.279
She's on her second neb
and the steroids are in.

20:00.280 --> 20:04.199
Well, that's no good. We should be intravenous
here, starting magnesium. Have you spoken to ITU?

20:04.200 --> 20:06.879
I was going to check with you first.
Med Reg aware?

20:06.880 --> 20:08.119
It was my plan, yeah.

20:08.120 --> 20:09.279
I'll do it.

20:09.280 --> 20:11.039
Karen, draw up some magnesium IV.

20:11.040 --> 20:13.439
Two grams. She's going
to need fluids, too.

20:13.440 --> 20:16.239
Let's make sure Outreach
have got her on the list, yeah?

20:16.240 --> 20:18.119
I've got this.

20:18.120 --> 20:20.320
I think Charlie needs a hand
in minors.

20:22.600 --> 20:24.479
Med Reg, please.

20:24.480 --> 20:28.920
Oh, and no drinks in Resus.
You know the rules.

20:42.800 --> 20:45.759
So what is it? She dump you? Or is
it just your time of the month?

20:45.760 --> 20:46.839
She had it under control!

20:46.840 --> 20:48.119
Did I say she didn't?

20:48.120 --> 20:51.119
No, you just talked to her like she
was a JHO with learning difficulties.

20:51.120 --> 20:56.319
So? Call the Daily Record. "Nurse
defends female doctor shocker."

20:56.320 --> 20:57.919
She's good.

20:57.920 --> 21:00.839
I've held the hand of enough crap
doctors to know the difference.

21:00.840 --> 21:03.799
Ally actually treats the nurses
with respect. She deserves the same.

21:03.800 --> 21:06.279
I know. You're right. It's just...

21:06.280 --> 21:07.799
I'm sorry. It's been a tricky day.

21:07.800 --> 21:09.079
Yeah, welcome to the club!

21:09.080 --> 21:11.159
Do you know, everyone knows
you're shagging her,

21:11.160 --> 21:13.599
so see if I were you, I'd get
over myself pretty damn quick.

21:13.600 --> 21:16.080
Cos if I had to take sides,
I know who I'd pick.

21:23.520 --> 21:26.279
I need some help with this wrist.
She's not keen on needles.

21:26.280 --> 21:30.119
When I say "not keen", I'm talking
like hysterical. Tried to bite me.

21:30.120 --> 21:31.759
Not in a good way.

21:31.760 --> 21:34.279
Oh, it just needs a tweak. We could
try her with some Entonox?

21:34.280 --> 21:35.679
Bit of oral sedation?

21:35.680 --> 21:39.280
I'm sold. Lead the way.
I'm right behind you. OK.

21:40.280 --> 21:41.839
So, what is this?

21:41.840 --> 21:44.239
Nitrous oxide. Laughing gas.

21:44.240 --> 21:46.839
Imagine drinking
six G and Ts in one.

21:46.840 --> 21:48.560
I'm more of a Bacardi girl, me.

21:49.720 --> 21:51.159
It's not doing anything.

21:51.160 --> 21:53.680
You need to keep breathing,
in and out, OK?

21:55.520 --> 21:57.480
Whoa, whoa, slow and deep.

21:58.480 --> 21:59.959
Keep it in your mouth.

21:59.960 --> 22:01.719
Whoohoo, that's what
all the boys say.

22:01.720 --> 22:03.479
No talking, just breathing.

22:03.480 --> 22:05.679
So, we're going to gently
pull on your wrist

22:05.680 --> 22:08.399
and pop your bones back in place,
and then...

22:08.400 --> 22:09.439
Paul.

22:09.440 --> 22:12.519
Paul here is going to pop
a plaster on it. No problem.

22:12.520 --> 22:14.879
Oh, do you know what?
I am feeling funny.

22:14.880 --> 22:17.719
What was that pill you gave me?
It's Diazepam.

22:17.720 --> 22:19.679
Just helps to make you feel
a bit more relaxed.

22:19.680 --> 22:21.119
Slow and deep, remember?

22:21.120 --> 22:22.400
Shall we turn it over?

22:24.840 --> 22:26.159
What was your name?

22:26.160 --> 22:28.160
I'm Ally. This is Charlie.

22:30.200 --> 22:33.960
No way you should be working here.
You're what? 12?

22:35.040 --> 22:37.399
I'm, like, 42.

22:37.400 --> 22:39.119
Secret is moisturiser.

22:39.120 --> 22:40.839
No way, Jose!

22:40.840 --> 22:45.879
Hey, does your mummy know
you're pretending to be a doctor?

22:45.880 --> 22:47.239
Tell her a joke.

22:47.240 --> 22:48.599
What?

22:48.600 --> 22:50.399
It's the best audience
you'll ever get.

22:50.400 --> 22:51.639
All right, try this. Er...

22:51.640 --> 22:55.999
What do you call a man with no arms
and no legs swimming in the sea?

22:56.000 --> 22:57.280
Bob.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.759
Ooh. There we go.

23:01.760 --> 23:04.399
Right. What goes zubb zubb?

23:04.400 --> 23:05.840
A bee flying backwards.

23:07.400 --> 23:09.399
Ooh! Oh, are we starting?

23:09.400 --> 23:10.759
Actually, we're all finished.

23:10.760 --> 23:11.879
That was it.

23:11.880 --> 23:14.680
Oh! Oh, no, no, no, no, no!
Five more minutes.

23:16.440 --> 23:17.879
Weird to say I enjoyed that?

23:17.880 --> 23:19.319
Your jokes are awful.

23:19.320 --> 23:21.479
What are you talking about?
I killed her in there.

23:21.480 --> 23:24.319
If that's true,
I'm calling the GMC. Again.

23:24.320 --> 23:25.839
Nursing Council, right back at you.

23:25.840 --> 23:27.880
If I go down,
I'm taking you with me.

23:28.960 --> 23:30.200
Ally.

23:50.720 --> 23:51.959
Sorry I was a bit abrupt.

23:51.960 --> 23:53.839
I could've dealt with it. I know.

23:53.840 --> 23:55.720
Well, what were all that about?

23:58.240 --> 23:59.719
Just been one of those weeks.

23:59.720 --> 24:01.160
Yeah, tell me about it.

24:02.920 --> 24:04.320
Ah, shit.

24:06.520 --> 24:10.799
Sorry. I mean, you can't blame me
for forgetting.

24:10.800 --> 24:15.679
You never really talk to me
about him. Or anyone.

24:15.680 --> 24:17.439
Is that a problem?

24:17.440 --> 24:19.959
I think it is. You never tell me
anything.

24:19.960 --> 24:22.560
Maybe there's nothing worth telling.

24:23.600 --> 24:25.199
I just want to be part of your life.

24:25.200 --> 24:26.479
You are!

24:26.480 --> 24:28.119
But right now, I'm reconsidering.

24:28.120 --> 24:31.520
Then I think we need to be honest
with each other, don't you?

24:37.360 --> 24:39.040
Are you free this weekend?

24:41.160 --> 24:42.719
Yeah, I think.

24:42.720 --> 24:46.359
Then I want to take you somewhere -
just you, me and Molly.

24:46.360 --> 24:48.840
You'll like it.
It's somewhere we can talk.

24:52.240 --> 24:53.720
OK, fine.

24:59.160 --> 25:02.399
Where are we going? I don't know -
it's all a big surprise!

25:02.400 --> 25:06.199
Today we are heading due north.
We may never return.

25:06.200 --> 25:07.999
Who knows what we'll find?

25:08.000 --> 25:09.359
Monsters?

25:09.360 --> 25:11.759
Hundreds of them.
They're everywhere.

25:11.760 --> 25:13.960
Where you'd least expect them.

26:09.880 --> 26:13.359
It's OK.
Bet you bring all the girls here.

26:13.360 --> 26:16.999
Absolutely not.
In fact, you're the first.

26:17.000 --> 26:18.440
I'm honoured!

26:22.560 --> 26:27.040
Sometimes I just need to remember the
rest of the world still looks like this.

26:28.360 --> 26:30.359
You get up here...

26:30.360 --> 26:32.440
and it all becomes clear.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.400
At least for me.

27:27.840 --> 27:30.839
Mummy, quick!
We're going on a monster hunt!

27:30.840 --> 27:32.320
Come on!

27:41.720 --> 27:45.199
It's freezing! No-one said anything
about monster hunts in the brochure.

27:45.200 --> 27:47.359
Er, no excuses, right?

27:47.360 --> 27:49.080
We can find you something.

27:54.640 --> 27:57.560
Wellies, coat.

27:59.640 --> 28:01.439
Mum, come on!

28:01.440 --> 28:03.640
You heard the lady.

28:05.000 --> 28:08.119
If I'd have known where we were going,
I'd have brought some proper clothes.

28:08.120 --> 28:09.799
Ah, sorry. I just assumed that...

28:09.800 --> 28:11.719
What, that I'd know what to bring?

28:11.720 --> 28:13.920
No, obviously. I'm... sorry.

28:15.560 --> 28:17.760
Mum! I'm coming.

28:52.560 --> 28:53.760
Hey!

28:57.640 --> 28:58.959
Let's keep going.

28:58.960 --> 29:00.240
Mummy's a slow coach.

29:05.000 --> 29:06.879
Does she still see her dad?

29:06.880 --> 29:09.640
Now and then. He tries.

29:10.680 --> 29:12.000
So what went wrong?

29:13.200 --> 29:14.919
I couldn't trust him.

29:14.920 --> 29:16.439
Money'd go missing.

29:16.440 --> 29:18.359
Then he'd disappear for days on end

29:18.360 --> 29:20.719
and show up
like nothing had happened.

29:20.720 --> 29:22.640
In the end I'd just had enough.

29:24.480 --> 29:28.840
Brigitte said things got physical.
At least she implied it.

29:33.960 --> 29:37.000
I mean, something like that
must be difficult to talk about.

29:38.880 --> 29:41.119
It makes you ashamed.

29:41.120 --> 29:42.520
Which is crazy.

29:43.600 --> 29:46.439
But you can't help how you feel.

29:46.440 --> 29:48.519
I'm not like that.

29:48.520 --> 29:51.399
Um, it feels weird to have
to say that, but it's true.

29:51.400 --> 29:52.679
I know.

29:52.680 --> 29:55.000
Never even had a fight.
Not even in school.

29:56.480 --> 29:58.239
I guess what I'm trying to say is

29:58.240 --> 30:01.600
you don't need to shut me out
from whatever it is.

30:09.080 --> 30:10.519
You must miss your kids.

30:10.520 --> 30:13.400
I do, but they're happy with Sarah.

30:14.800 --> 30:16.879
Did she love it up here, too?

30:16.880 --> 30:18.639
Actually, she prefers a warm bath.

30:18.640 --> 30:21.879
Anyway, we came up here to talk about us
and suddenly we're talking about my ex.

30:21.880 --> 30:24.319
Well, you asked me about Karl
and I'm wearing her coat.

30:24.320 --> 30:25.839
No, you're wearing A coat.

30:25.840 --> 30:29.519
Neither of us can just start over
as if the past never happened. OK.

30:29.520 --> 30:31.559
I'm not her. I know that!

30:31.560 --> 30:33.479
It's all too much. Too quick.

30:33.480 --> 30:37.799
Look, if this is about Sarah,
then I promise you, it's over.

30:37.800 --> 30:40.119
Which is why I'm moving on.
All right, yes, I loved her.

30:40.120 --> 30:43.079
I married her, for God's sake. But
things change. It didn't work out.

30:43.080 --> 30:44.759
We split up, and then I met you.

30:44.760 --> 30:46.680
Simple. Cos it's true.

30:52.360 --> 30:53.760
Talk to me.

30:54.760 --> 30:55.880
Please.

31:03.160 --> 31:04.399
I'm cold.

31:04.400 --> 31:05.519
I'm going to go back.

31:05.520 --> 31:07.879
Come on, there's only about
another mile to the top.

31:07.880 --> 31:10.959
I promise you it's worth it.
You go. I'm going back.

31:10.960 --> 31:12.879
Molly, come on.

31:12.880 --> 31:15.279
Ally, come on!

31:15.280 --> 31:16.400
Talk to me!

31:17.440 --> 31:18.720
Ally!

31:21.600 --> 31:22.880
Cath!

31:50.160 --> 31:51.759
Talk to me.

31:51.760 --> 31:53.399
I need to go.

31:53.400 --> 31:56.279
Where? Another city? Another
hospital? Is that how this works?

31:56.280 --> 31:57.759
Just leave me alone!

31:57.760 --> 32:00.279
Oh, for fuck's sake!
I know who you are.

32:00.280 --> 32:04.199
Your name's Cath Hardacre.
You're a ward sister in Sheffield.

32:04.200 --> 32:07.759
Dr Alison Sutton left for a sheep
farm in New Zealand six months ago.

32:07.760 --> 32:08.999
How long have you known?

32:09.000 --> 32:11.879
That night, the call from the care
home. When you were gone, I checked.

32:11.880 --> 32:14.439
Then why have you brought me here?
What do you want?

32:14.440 --> 32:16.680
I want to help you.

32:21.840 --> 32:23.199
You don't even know me.

32:23.200 --> 32:24.640
Oh, believe me, I get that!

32:29.640 --> 32:32.079
So is any of this real?

32:32.080 --> 32:34.080
You think I used you?

32:35.560 --> 32:37.199
Did you?

32:37.200 --> 32:39.039
I never wanted this to happen!

32:39.040 --> 32:40.999
Yes, but you didn't stop it!

32:41.000 --> 32:43.359
Or at any point
you could have said no.

32:43.360 --> 32:46.319
I mean, I didn't
put pressure on you.

32:46.320 --> 32:51.039
I just thought it was normal.
It was easy. It felt right.

32:51.040 --> 32:52.440
It was.

32:55.120 --> 32:56.320
I...

32:59.760 --> 33:03.399
I don't get it. I mean,
if you knew, why are we even here?

33:03.400 --> 33:06.799
When I found out, I was this close
to telling Brigitte.

33:06.800 --> 33:08.279
I walked into her office.

33:08.280 --> 33:10.039
Why didn't you?

33:10.040 --> 33:12.279
Because of what she said.

33:12.280 --> 33:13.760
What we both think.

33:14.840 --> 33:16.759
You're a good doctor.

33:16.760 --> 33:18.919
You're smart. You're dedicated.

33:18.920 --> 33:22.159
You make the right call,
time after time.

33:22.160 --> 33:23.799
I want to leave, now.

33:23.800 --> 33:27.199
I can't ask you to get involved in
this. It was my mistake, not yours.

33:27.200 --> 33:29.799
OK. I get it,
and that's your choice.

33:29.800 --> 33:36.039
But first just... Just tell me why.
I need to know why you did this.

33:36.040 --> 33:37.320
Come on.

33:43.560 --> 33:46.919
When I was a nurse,
when I saw that things were wrong,

33:46.920 --> 33:50.159
that people were dying,
I stood up and said so,

33:50.160 --> 33:52.239
because that's what my dad
had always taught me -

33:52.240 --> 33:54.999
to do and say what was right,
not what was easy.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.240
And because of that,
I lost everything.

33:58.800 --> 34:01.560
No job, no future for me or my kid.

34:02.680 --> 34:05.919
Is that what you get for being a
good person? Is that what I deserve?

34:05.920 --> 34:08.120
After all the work I've put in!

34:12.000 --> 34:16.199
Do you know what she said
when she left? The real Ally?

34:18.400 --> 34:20.998
"Fuck the NHS."

34:21.000 --> 34:23.440
And they all laughed
like it were funny.

34:25.440 --> 34:29.039
She was a doctor.
She had everything I didn't have,

34:29.040 --> 34:33.279
and she was throwing it all away.
Her life, her career...

34:33.280 --> 34:35.079
What, so you just took it?

34:35.080 --> 34:38.958
Yes, I took it!
Because I knew I could do it.

34:38.960 --> 34:41.119
Not just for me.

34:41.120 --> 34:43.839
So that when it was Molly's turn,
she could have a life like that.

34:43.840 --> 34:46.839
A life you could just throw away
if she wanted to.

34:46.840 --> 34:49.520
Now that's a real choice,
don't you think?

34:51.280 --> 34:52.920
Oh...

34:59.160 --> 35:03.039
Dr Alison Sutton
is the best we've had.

35:03.040 --> 35:04.879
All right?

35:04.880 --> 35:06.519
We needed you because you were good.

35:06.520 --> 35:08.719
You're almost too good to be true.

35:08.720 --> 35:10.839
What, you think
I want this getting out?

35:10.840 --> 35:12.720
The hospital that hired an impostor?

35:14.520 --> 35:17.639
Listen, if I was going to tell
someone, I'd have done it already.

35:17.640 --> 35:19.519
So if you're going to leave,
just leave.

35:19.520 --> 35:22.239
Go somewhere else, find a job.
I'd hire you.

35:22.240 --> 35:25.880
You can walk away now,
but eventually someone'll find you.

35:32.920 --> 35:34.720
Come home with me.

35:36.520 --> 35:37.840
Move in.

35:38.920 --> 35:40.919
I can protect you.

35:40.920 --> 35:41.960
Why?

35:43.040 --> 35:44.399
Why would you do that?

35:44.400 --> 35:47.400
I want you in my life.
You and Molly.

35:48.680 --> 35:50.159
I love you.

35:50.160 --> 35:53.319
That's why I'm offering to risk
everything I've ever worked for.

35:53.320 --> 35:57.400
But if I'm going to do that, I
need to know you feel the same way.

36:00.640 --> 36:03.240
Are you prepared to let me
help you with this?

36:07.480 --> 36:08.880
I don't know.

37:12.440 --> 37:13.799
Well?

37:13.800 --> 37:15.759
OK.

37:15.760 --> 37:17.560
Let's go home.

37:20.360 --> 37:21.720
OK.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.359
Do you promise
you'll come and visit me?

37:33.360 --> 37:35.119
Of course.

37:35.120 --> 37:37.080
I've got something for you.

37:38.640 --> 37:40.799
Do you know how much money
this is worth?

37:40.800 --> 37:42.719
£12,000.

37:42.720 --> 37:44.039
Minimum.

37:44.040 --> 37:45.759
Now, as we have discussed,

37:45.760 --> 37:50.359
this is a precious antique that's
been in my family for many a year.

37:50.360 --> 37:55.959
But I know how much you love it, so
I have decided to entrust it to you.

37:55.960 --> 37:57.599
There's only one condition.

37:57.600 --> 38:00.079
I must be allowed to come
and see it from time to time.

38:00.080 --> 38:01.599
OK.

38:01.600 --> 38:03.160
Then we have a deal.

38:05.240 --> 38:06.439
Thank you.

38:06.440 --> 38:10.999
Och, you all leave in the end.
Most I'm glad to see the back of.

38:11.000 --> 38:14.600
Now remember, Saturday night
is Strictly night.

38:15.640 --> 38:17.439
I expect to see you here.

38:17.440 --> 38:18.960
Promise.

38:19.960 --> 38:21.240
Come here.

38:23.160 --> 38:24.840
You take care of yourself, pet.

38:30.480 --> 38:31.599
Bye, darling.

38:31.600 --> 38:33.280
Give that to Mummy.

38:45.720 --> 38:47.120
Right, get in.

38:53.040 --> 38:54.280
You OK?

38:57.160 --> 38:59.640
Night-night, sweetheart.
Night-night.

39:12.040 --> 39:14.360
OK. AF, five causes of.

39:15.600 --> 39:18.839
Er... ischaemic heart disease.

39:18.840 --> 39:21.399
Mitral stenosis...

39:21.400 --> 39:22.919
What is this, 1950?

39:22.920 --> 39:27.479
Hypertension. Thyrotoxicosis.
Atrial myxoma.

39:27.480 --> 39:29.839
Oh! That's a good one. Impressive.

39:29.840 --> 39:31.639
Alcohol. Of course.

39:31.640 --> 39:33.439
You forgot Chagas disease.

39:33.440 --> 39:37.359
Tropical infection.
Mainly South America.

39:37.360 --> 39:41.440
The bacteria's spread by the deadly,
if affectionate, kissing bug.

39:47.880 --> 39:50.679
I just considered it too obscure
and childish.

39:50.680 --> 39:53.599
Chagas disease has been funny since
the first day of medical school

39:53.600 --> 39:55.959
and will be funny
until the day I die.

39:55.960 --> 39:58.479
Actually, it's a
protozoal infection.

39:58.480 --> 39:59.959
No, it's bacterial.

39:59.960 --> 40:01.639
Protozoal.

40:01.640 --> 40:04.000
There, check if you don't
believe me.

40:08.880 --> 40:12.039
Ah! Shit.

40:12.040 --> 40:14.040
Hm!

40:22.800 --> 40:25.079
So, I've just checked
with the Scottish side.

40:25.080 --> 40:27.399
It's not a problem in principle.

40:27.400 --> 40:30.079
In fact, they've just had
somebody go off long-term sick,

40:30.080 --> 40:31.799
so, er, could be a while.

40:31.800 --> 40:33.160
That's great!

40:34.320 --> 40:37.920
Transfer form, blah blah blah.
Just fill it in, get it back to me.

40:39.680 --> 40:40.720
Not here.

40:41.800 --> 40:44.159
Right. Sure. Um, sorry.

40:44.160 --> 40:45.879
And we got a delivery, Wednesday.

40:45.880 --> 40:48.159
Motorcycle place in Edinburgh.

40:48.160 --> 40:50.680
So if you manage to find it,
you've got the job.

40:52.120 --> 40:53.399
OK.

40:53.400 --> 40:54.679
On you go.

40:54.680 --> 40:55.960
Cheers, Dale.

40:58.800 --> 41:00.479
I think it's underhand.

41:00.480 --> 41:03.039
And if it's all a mistake?
This whole thing?

41:03.040 --> 41:04.319
Nobody ever knows anything.

41:04.320 --> 41:06.719
No accusations, no drama,
and most importantly,

41:06.720 --> 41:08.279
no bad publicity for the Trust.

41:08.280 --> 41:10.519
Paul here is a fully trained HCA.

41:10.520 --> 41:13.159
All I want him to do is watch
and report back to me.

41:13.160 --> 41:14.880
Apart from that, he's all yours.

41:17.520 --> 41:20.599
Personally, I would
just grin and bear it.

41:20.600 --> 41:23.039
Just a little prick,
isn't that what you doctors say?

41:23.040 --> 41:24.960
You took the words out of my mouth.

41:27.680 --> 41:29.279
How fast do you want it?

41:29.280 --> 41:32.480
Straight in. 20 minutes. See what
it does to her blood pressure.

41:45.720 --> 41:49.719
Ally. So, Mohammed's let us down
again. Something about a-a wedding.

41:49.720 --> 41:52.399
I swear, one of his bloody family
gets married every week.

41:52.400 --> 41:55.279
So it's just you and me
this evening. Seriously?

41:55.280 --> 41:57.319
On a Friday night, as well.

41:57.320 --> 41:59.679
Just think of it as
a girls' night in with music

41:59.680 --> 42:02.239
and dancing and vomit and blood.

42:02.240 --> 42:03.799
What about clinical staffing?

42:03.800 --> 42:05.839
Oh, as much use
as a chocolate teapot.

42:05.840 --> 42:08.239
Is that racist?
Wasn't meant to be racist.

42:08.240 --> 42:12.279
My gran used to say it. Oh, mind
you, she was a terrible racist.

42:12.280 --> 42:15.559
Mm. And it's a full moon.
So we will have to cope.

42:15.560 --> 42:16.880
I am just warning you.

42:29.080 --> 42:30.400
Mr Kennedy?

42:34.840 --> 42:36.279
After you. Cheers.

42:36.280 --> 42:38.159
If you'll just go through
this one here.

42:38.160 --> 42:40.479
Mr Kennedy? I'm Dr Sutton.

42:40.480 --> 42:41.519
Ally.

42:41.520 --> 42:42.919
Is it always like this in here?

42:42.920 --> 42:45.839
Only on full-moon Friday.
Brings 'em all out.

42:45.840 --> 42:48.039
I'm just sorry to be making
more work for you, so...?

42:48.040 --> 42:51.439
The bad news is the wrist is fractured, but
the good news is it's in the right place,

42:51.440 --> 42:54.279
so we're just going to pop a plaster
on and then you'll be good to go.

42:54.280 --> 42:56.759
OK, thanks.
You'll get that sorted now, then?

42:56.760 --> 42:58.959
Sorry, there is a bit of a wait
for treatments.

42:58.960 --> 43:00.159
So I'll stay here?

43:00.160 --> 43:02.199
Well, the thing is,
we're a bit short on cubicles.

43:02.200 --> 43:03.559
Could I ask you to step outside

43:03.560 --> 43:05.319
and then we'll
get to you as soon as we can?

43:05.320 --> 43:06.680
Ah, whatever. Sorry.

43:08.360 --> 43:09.959
So if you just want to take a seat.

43:09.960 --> 43:11.000
Aye, all right.

43:13.240 --> 43:14.960
Mr Gerrard?

43:17.080 --> 43:18.999
Looks like I'm finally being called.

43:19.000 --> 43:20.679
Look, I said I'm sorry,

43:20.680 --> 43:23.640
Dubai can kiss my arse if that's
going to be their attitude.

43:27.480 --> 43:29.559
Oh, looks like a nasty abscess
there.

43:29.560 --> 43:32.119
And there's some swelling
below the jawline that concerns me.

43:32.120 --> 43:33.639
Have you been to see your dentist?

43:33.640 --> 43:36.239
Oh, well, I've been busy.
I'm just back from a business trip.

43:36.240 --> 43:38.439
I'm going to get our Max Fax
team to come and take a look.

43:38.440 --> 43:39.799
Hi.

43:39.800 --> 43:41.599
For Christ's sake, no,

43:41.600 --> 43:44.159
that's a million miles
from being acceptable!

43:44.160 --> 43:45.639
Oh, for heaven's sake!

43:45.640 --> 43:47.839
No mobiles in the clinical area.
Sorry.

43:47.840 --> 43:49.319
OK, so what's the problem in here?

43:49.320 --> 43:50.799
Dental abscess, lower jaw.

43:50.800 --> 43:53.439
Sub mandibular extension
and his voice is a bit hoarse.

43:53.440 --> 43:54.639
I was about to call Max Fax.

43:54.640 --> 43:57.599
No, Amoxycillin and Mentronidazole.
Yeah, then go and see your dentist.

43:57.600 --> 43:59.439
Well, I still think we should get
Max Fax...

43:59.440 --> 44:01.200
Yeah. Can we have a chat?

44:03.160 --> 44:05.639
OK, we have got six people
waiting on trolleys in majors, OK?

44:05.640 --> 44:07.319
And another two ambulances en route.

44:07.320 --> 44:09.119
I understand that. I just...
Dr Rayne?

44:09.120 --> 44:10.559
Yeah, in a minute!

44:10.560 --> 44:12.159
We see, we treat, we dispose, OK?

44:12.160 --> 44:14.479
Anyone who doesn't need to be here,
we get rid of them. OK.

44:14.480 --> 44:18.039
Got one inbound. Cardiac arrest,
ETA six minutes.

44:18.040 --> 44:21.159
Oh, Christ, OK. Get him out of here,
then get to Resus.

44:21.160 --> 44:23.800
OK. OK. Who can we move?

44:33.880 --> 44:34.920
You all right?

44:36.400 --> 44:37.800
All right.

44:41.200 --> 44:43.079
So, what? We, er, staying up?

44:43.080 --> 44:44.719
Yeah, dream on.

44:44.720 --> 44:47.119
Manager's a muppet.
Call Big Sam, right?

44:47.120 --> 44:48.360
Mm-hm.

44:51.160 --> 44:52.599
How's the knee?

44:52.600 --> 44:54.999
Fine. Thanks.

44:55.000 --> 44:59.199
Look, er, probably won't see
you around. Moving up north.

44:59.200 --> 45:01.559
Right. Yeah, getting a transfer
to Scotland.

45:01.560 --> 45:03.239
See a bit more of the kid, you know.

45:03.240 --> 45:04.880
And Cath's all right with that?

45:07.560 --> 45:09.119
She say something to you about me?

45:09.120 --> 45:11.599
Look, don't worry about it.
Good luck, yeah?

45:11.600 --> 45:12.800
Hey.

45:13.960 --> 45:15.959
Last time I saw you,
you said something.

45:15.960 --> 45:17.999
"Pick on those who can fight back."

45:18.000 --> 45:19.639
Right?

45:19.640 --> 45:22.919
Didn't get it. What did she say
to you? Nothing.

45:22.920 --> 45:24.000
Bullshit.

45:25.000 --> 45:26.279
OK, fine.

45:26.280 --> 45:29.680
She told me that she'd moved away
because you got physical with her.

45:31.000 --> 45:32.479
She said that?

45:32.480 --> 45:34.199
Not in those exact words, but yeah.

45:34.200 --> 45:36.999
That you'd hit her
and she didn't feel safe any more.

45:37.000 --> 45:38.959
That's why she got out.

45:38.960 --> 45:40.879
Fuck!

45:40.880 --> 45:42.639
Look, that's not true.

45:42.640 --> 45:45.240
Look, whatever.
It's none of my business, mate.

45:50.280 --> 45:53.639
Hey, hey. She is lying.
Why would she tell you that?

45:53.640 --> 45:56.719
I mean, we had problems, sure,
but I never touched her.

45:56.720 --> 45:58.519
I swear on my daughter's life.

45:58.520 --> 46:00.599
Fine. It's between you and her.

46:00.600 --> 46:03.719
Look, I don't understand.
Cath never lies. She can't stand it.

46:03.720 --> 46:04.999
Always been the same.

46:05.000 --> 46:07.319
I mean, why do you think
we split up in the first place?

46:07.320 --> 46:10.000
People say weird things,
yeah, all the time.

46:15.560 --> 46:17.479
Resus Two's just gone to ITU.

46:17.480 --> 46:18.759
How's his pressure?

46:18.760 --> 46:20.959
Holding with fluids.
Temperature's down, too.

46:20.960 --> 46:22.919
Well, as long as he's
someone else's problem.

46:22.920 --> 46:24.040
What time is it?

46:25.280 --> 46:27.159
Er... nearly two.

46:27.160 --> 46:29.720
And breathe. I think
we may have survived.

46:30.720 --> 46:32.680
Ooh, how's the house-hunting going?

46:34.080 --> 46:35.919
Actually, I've moved in with Andy.

46:35.920 --> 46:37.559
What? Shit!

46:37.560 --> 46:39.239
Last week. Not common knowledge.

46:39.240 --> 46:40.919
Do I need to buy a hat?

46:40.920 --> 46:42.799
We're just seeing how it goes.

46:42.800 --> 46:45.160
Oh, my God!

46:46.400 --> 46:48.119
Oh, tell them we're busy. Or dead.

46:48.120 --> 46:50.000
Or whichever's the more convincing.

46:51.360 --> 46:52.919
OK, thanks.

46:52.920 --> 46:56.359
40-year-old male, obstructed airway,
suspected dental abscess,

46:56.360 --> 46:57.760
one minute.

47:14.080 --> 47:17.039
Picked him up New Town.
Stridor at scene.

47:17.040 --> 47:19.479
Lost his airway in the back.
Can't bag him.

47:19.480 --> 47:21.519
He hasn't been breathing
for three minutes.

47:21.520 --> 47:23.679
That's him. The toothache.

47:23.680 --> 47:25.479
Shit!

47:25.480 --> 47:26.879
Sats unrecordable.

47:26.880 --> 47:28.079
Fast bleep anaesthetics.

47:28.080 --> 47:29.599
OK. One, two, three.

47:29.600 --> 47:32.279
ENT. Which one?

47:32.280 --> 47:34.199
I-I-I don't know. Er, either.

47:34.200 --> 47:35.839
Er, both.

47:35.840 --> 47:38.199
Oh, shit. Laryngoscope.

47:38.200 --> 47:42.639
Er, crash call to ED Resus. Anaesthetics and ENT.
No, I'll bag him, in fact.

47:42.640 --> 47:44.079
OK, thanks.

47:44.080 --> 47:46.359
OK, sux and Propofol.

47:46.360 --> 47:47.719
No access.

47:47.720 --> 47:49.440
Shit. Ally!

47:53.440 --> 47:55.960
We need to get an airway, now!

47:58.480 --> 48:00.119
OK. Have we got access?

48:00.120 --> 48:02.519
Nearly, nearly.

48:02.520 --> 48:04.039
Saturation is 60%.

48:04.040 --> 48:05.520
Oh, for Christ sake!

48:10.240 --> 48:12.079
Come on! I'm in!

48:12.080 --> 48:14.159
Where's Anaesthetics?

48:14.160 --> 48:15.919
OK, get the sux.

48:15.920 --> 48:18.120
And I need a laryngoscope right now.

48:19.960 --> 48:21.959
Drugs are in. He's paralysed.

48:21.960 --> 48:25.799
OK, that's no good -
we need someone immediately!

48:25.800 --> 48:27.960
Anaesthetics are stuck
on Labour Ward.

48:42.520 --> 48:44.039
How long?

48:44.040 --> 48:45.320
Two minutes.

48:48.400 --> 48:50.280
He's too swollen. I...

48:54.720 --> 48:56.999
We need to get some oxygen
into him now.

48:57.000 --> 48:59.160
I can't see anything. More suction.

49:10.000 --> 49:11.799
It's been three minutes.

49:11.800 --> 49:13.720
I-I can't do this!

49:14.800 --> 49:16.040
You try.

49:24.040 --> 49:25.719
OK. We need ENT. Call 'em again.

49:25.720 --> 49:26.920
OK.

49:29.960 --> 49:32.119
Need to fast bleep ENT to ED Resus.

49:32.120 --> 49:34.200
Airway emergency. OK.

49:39.640 --> 49:43.360
That's four minutes.
What do you want to do?

49:46.360 --> 49:48.239
Dr Rayne?

49:48.240 --> 49:50.960
Surgical airway. Now.

49:52.800 --> 49:55.240
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

50:17.920 --> 50:19.920
Swab.

50:21.320 --> 50:23.480
He'll need suction.

50:28.840 --> 50:30.240
Deeper.

50:33.800 --> 50:35.360
Oh, shit!

50:36.840 --> 50:38.040
Arterial.

50:42.680 --> 50:43.959
Oh, fuck!

50:43.960 --> 50:45.600
OK, er, more swabs.

50:57.480 --> 50:59.080
I need that thing.

51:03.240 --> 51:04.480
Yeah.

51:12.560 --> 51:14.160
OK. Bagging him now.

51:18.320 --> 51:19.999
Jesus.

51:20.000 --> 51:23.679
I need a full tracheostomy kit now.
How long's he been down?

51:23.680 --> 51:25.560
Over five minutes.

51:40.480 --> 51:42.159
I'm sorry.

51:42.160 --> 51:44.279
ITU are assessing.

51:44.280 --> 51:49.840
It was an abscess. It was a fucking
dental abscess. What...

51:52.560 --> 51:54.280
I sent him home.

51:57.520 --> 51:59.239
You need to back me up.

51:59.240 --> 52:02.479
I-it was simple, uncomplicated...

52:02.480 --> 52:03.679
Brigitte!

52:03.680 --> 52:06.920
Do you want the bloody inquisition
here asking questions?

52:08.160 --> 52:09.600
It was just...

52:12.400 --> 52:14.440
We need to support each other.

52:21.800 --> 52:24.760
Right, I need you to alter this.
Same pen.

52:35.360 --> 52:38.239
It was... It was out of the blue.
Unpredictable.

52:38.240 --> 52:41.160
Er, just everything has to stack up,
and then it goes away.

52:43.680 --> 52:45.479
No.

52:45.480 --> 52:48.439
Ally... if there's a complaint,
there'll be a SUI.

52:48.440 --> 52:49.959
We will be here for months.

52:49.960 --> 52:54.439
They will rake over our records, our
experience... time and time again.

52:54.440 --> 52:56.040
Believe me, I know.

53:08.600 --> 53:09.800
Oh!

54:34.400 --> 54:38.239
Dr Brenner. You'll be aware we had a serious
clinical incident in your department last night.

54:38.240 --> 54:41.519
Dr Rayne and Dr Sutton
were the two clinicians involved.

54:41.520 --> 54:42.919
We need to stick together on this.

54:42.920 --> 54:45.239
If they start to investigate you,
it puts us both at risk,

54:45.240 --> 54:47.279
which means that Brigitte
needs to take the fall.

54:47.280 --> 54:49.039
What are you going to do?

54:49.040 --> 54:51.879
These guys need us, so show me
what a real doctor can do.

54:51.880 --> 54:53.400
Ally?

54:54.600 --> 54:56.400
She is coming with me.

54:58.280 --> 54:59.720
Where's Molly?

55:01.280 --> 55:03.680
I took something
that didn't belong to me.
