That, little sister, was gold.

- Go Lions!
- Boo-yah!

00:18.685 --> 00:21.771
Okay, now, when I answered this
question during my interview

00:21.855 --> 00:23.398
not only did I get into Columbia

00:23.481 --> 00:26.109
but my interviewer and I
both got a chill.

00:26.192 --> 00:27.444

- Well..
- What I said was..

"I want people to say
that honesty was my compass

00:40.665 --> 00:42.792
and truth my true north."

up to the compass.

Who's Trudy North?

No, you have to come up
with your own answer.

Oh, okay, no problem.

How do I want people
to remember me?

00:55.138 --> 00:56.514
Um, well..

00:58.600 --> 01:00.977
If my friends
think about me and smile

01:01.060 --> 01:03.271
then I think
I've had a good life.

01:04.230 --> 01:06.816
I just got another chill.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.985
You know, you really
surprise me sometimes.

I mean, you don't show people

01:10.403 --> 01:12.572
that deep, thoughtful side
of yourself very often.

- That was pretty awesome.
- Thanks.

- 'Hi.'

But you know the life
of a doctor's girlfriend.

No problem.

01:25.418 --> 01:26.377
I was just helping Holly

01:26.461 --> 01:27.545

Oh, Holly,
don't sweat it.

good SAT scores

about the interview.

- So, Columbia, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

01:39.557 --> 01:40.934
I tried to get
into med school there.

01:41.017 --> 01:42.143
They turned me down.

01:42.227 --> 01:43.186
Yeah, well..

01:43.269 --> 01:44.646
You've got to be pretty special

01:44.729 --> 01:45.772
to get in there.

01:45.855 --> 01:48.191
I ended up going to Harvard.

you got in somewhere.

Oh, this is great.
My conference was canceled.

02:01.412 --> 02:04.165
You know what that means,
I have the whole afternoon off

02:04.249 --> 02:06.793

eight hours to be together.

- No, not really.
- Okay.

what I'm trying to say is

a bunch of friends today

- We could die.

Last week when you made Vince
that romantic dinner

04:58.965 --> 05:00.091

you were like

myself through this anymore."

Okay, well, you didn't know me

05:15.189 --> 05:16.399
during my Coney Island period.

"Where's Holly?"
"Coney Island."

taking the afternoon off.

05:36.169 --> 05:38.171
There's a problem
with me and doctor.

05:38.254 --> 05:41.174
But can it wait? I'm going to
surprise Holly at her interview.

05:41.257 --> 05:42.633
I thought maybe
I'd take her out to dinner.

05:42.717 --> 05:44.927
We did the hippity-dippity.

05:46.554 --> 05:50.058
Okay, I'm really
happy for you, but, um..

05:50.141 --> 05:51.642

to hear about it.

an awesome foot massage.

the tops of my toes.

- Giggle.

- During?
- Just before the dippity.

06:42.193 --> 06:43.820
Is it possible
it wasn't a giggle?

06:43.903 --> 06:46.155
Maybe it was
the bed creaking.

No, the bed
wasn't moving enough.

already gone in there?

and she had to cancel.

What did she say?

09:35.199 --> 09:36.158
Oh, I didn't talk to her.

09:36.242 --> 09:38.077
I talked to her sister Val.

09:39.370 --> 09:40.788
Oh, Val. Really.

09:41.914 --> 09:43.499
What exactly did Val say?

09:43.582 --> 09:47.003
Just that Holly was detained,
and she couldn't make it today.

09:47.086 --> 09:48.921
Oh, my God.

09:49.005 --> 09:51.340
Oh, don't worry.
It didn't sound serious.

09:51.424 --> 09:52.466
I'm sure she'll be okay.

09:52.550 --> 09:55.011
Ha ha ha ha.

09:55.094 --> 09:57.305
I wouldn't be so sure
about that.

10:11.444 --> 10:12.778
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:12.862 --> 10:13.946
How was your interview?

10:14.030 --> 10:15.865
Oh, the admissions office
called

10:15.948 --> 10:17.074
and canceled on me.

10:17.158 --> 10:19.201
Apparently, they had
some sort of emergency.

10:19.285 --> 10:20.369
An emergency, huh?

10:20.453 --> 10:22.538
Yeah,
some "Scholastic disaster."

10:22.621 --> 10:26.042
I don't know, but they said
that they'll just reschedule.

10:26.125 --> 10:27.960
Would you stop it?
I know what you did.

10:28.044 --> 10:29.128
What?

10:29.211 --> 10:30.796
You canceled
your college interview.

10:30.880 --> 10:32.506
I went there to surprise you.
I know everything.

10:32.590 --> 10:34.967
Okay, okay, yes, I did.
Calm down.

10:35.051 --> 10:36.260
I did cancel my interview

10:36.344 --> 10:37.803
but it was
for a perfectly good reason.

10:37.887 --> 10:39.722
Oh, good, good.
I can't wait to hear this one.

10:39.805 --> 10:41.307
Go ahead, tell me,
tell me, tell me.

10:41.390 --> 10:43.559
I went to Coney Island!

10:46.062 --> 10:47.146
Coney Island?

10:47.229 --> 10:49.732
Yeah, Vince got us in for free.

10:49.815 --> 10:51.317
- Vince? Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

10:51.400 --> 10:53.361
It was so much fun. We were,
like, the only ones there.

10:53.444 --> 10:54.904
Can you believe that?

10:54.987 --> 10:56.697
No. I can't believe any of this.

10:56.781 --> 10:59.158
You went to Coney Island instead
of your college interview?

10:59.241 --> 11:00.701
Do you understand
what you have done?

11:00.785 --> 11:02.161
Why are you being so dramatic?

11:02.244 --> 11:03.579
I'll just call and reschedule.

11:03.662 --> 11:04.872
Reschedule? Yeah.

11:04.955 --> 11:06.582
I have been on the phone
for the past two hours

11:06.665 --> 11:08.084
trying to get you
another interview.

11:08.167 --> 11:10.086
Do you have any idea
when the next slot is open?

11:10.169 --> 11:11.879
- Tuesday..
- Great. I'll be there.

11:11.962 --> 11:12.922
Mnh-mnh, no.

11:13.005 --> 11:15.841
Tuesday, March 15, 2005.

11:15.925 --> 11:17.635
What? That's, like, next year.

11:17.718 --> 11:20.763
Hmm. It's not like next year.
It is next year.

11:20.846 --> 11:22.598
Okay, well, I'm sure
there's something--

11:22.681 --> 11:24.683
No, there isn't. You blew it.

11:24.767 --> 11:26.685
Okay, well, maybe I can..

11:26.769 --> 11:28.104
No, you can't.

11:28.187 --> 11:29.438
Do you have any idea

11:29.522 --> 11:31.357
how many people want
to get into Columbia?

11:31.440 --> 11:32.942
Did you think they were
just going to stop

11:33.025 --> 11:35.694
and fit you in whenever
it was convenient for you?

11:35.778 --> 11:36.946
I'm sorry.

11:37.029 --> 11:38.989
I'm sorry.
I'm so, so sorry.

11:39.073 --> 11:40.241
Just stop being sorry

11:40.324 --> 11:41.909
and just take control
of your life.

11:41.992 --> 11:43.953
Stop letting some boy
who doesn't even..

11:46.288 --> 11:48.374
What? Doesn't even what?

11:48.457 --> 11:52.002
I just don't want to see you
let some boy ruin your future.

11:52.086 --> 11:54.797
He's not. It was my decision
to go to Coney Island

11:54.880 --> 11:57.591
and it wasn't for some boy
who doesn't even.

12:01.679 --> 12:02.721
What was that?

12:02.805 --> 12:03.889
Because you can't hear
my door slam

12:03.973 --> 12:05.099
from upstairs.

12:10.563 --> 12:12.356
Interview..

12:12.440 --> 12:14.900
[muttering]

12:14.984 --> 12:16.986
What?

12:17.069 --> 12:18.237
I'm a little hurt.

12:18.320 --> 12:19.280
About what?

12:19.363 --> 12:20.614
That you would choose

12:20.698 --> 12:23.284
to confide in the eggs
instead of me.

12:23.367 --> 12:24.743
Lauren, I just didn't want
to burden you.

12:24.827 --> 12:26.078
Oh, burden me?

12:26.162 --> 12:27.329
I'm your friend, okay?

12:27.413 --> 12:29.999
Look, who knows you
better than I do?

12:30.082 --> 12:31.667
I'm just so worried
about her.

12:32.918 --> 12:35.296
Who?

12:35.379 --> 12:38.632
- Holly.
- Ah. Go on. Yes.

12:38.716 --> 12:41.135
I-I.. This is
a very critical time for her.

12:41.218 --> 12:43.387
I don't think she realizes she
is at a crossroads right now

12:43.471 --> 12:45.639
and every decision
she makes from here on out

12:45.723 --> 12:47.224
affects the rest of her life.

12:47.308 --> 12:50.811
Oh, come here. Come here.

12:50.895 --> 12:53.481
What do I do about the giggler?

12:55.900 --> 12:56.901
I don't know.

12:56.984 --> 12:57.985
You said yourself

12:58.068 --> 12:59.028
this relationship with Brad

12:59.111 --> 13:00.154
isn't working out so..

13:00.237 --> 13:01.572
...just end it.

13:01.655 --> 13:02.698
God, I was so much more

13:02.781 --> 13:04.241
sensitive to your problem.

13:05.117 --> 13:06.619
Okay, do you love him?

13:06.702 --> 13:08.746
Who, "Giggles?" Hell no.

13:08.829 --> 13:11.457
Okay, why don't you write a list
of the pros and cons?

13:11.540 --> 13:12.708
Ooh, I did it.

13:12.791 --> 13:14.710
Let's start with the cons.

13:16.378 --> 13:18.464
Okay. Ahem.

13:18.547 --> 13:19.965
He's tactless.

13:20.049 --> 13:22.218
Tells disgusting stories.

13:22.301 --> 13:24.470
Often smells like sick people.

13:25.721 --> 13:27.097
When he talks,
sometimes he gets

13:27.181 --> 13:30.893
that white dot of spit
that goes up and down.

13:30.976 --> 13:32.228
Okay, okay.

13:32.311 --> 13:34.188
Oh, and twice, I saw earwax.

13:34.271 --> 13:35.731
Once 'cause he showed me.

13:37.650 --> 13:38.734
How about the pros?

13:38.817 --> 13:40.486
Ooh, I got a whole page.

13:43.781 --> 13:44.907
That's it?

13:44.990 --> 13:45.950
That's the only reason you're

13:46.033 --> 13:47.076
staying in this relationship?

13:47.159 --> 13:48.244
Because he's a doctor

13:48.327 --> 13:49.828
and he buys you fancy things

13:49.912 --> 13:51.372
and takes you
to expensive dinners?

13:51.455 --> 13:53.207
I am appalled.

13:53.290 --> 13:55.084
You think I'm with doctor
for his money?

13:55.167 --> 13:57.711
Why else would you be so
obsessed with dating a doctor?

13:57.795 --> 13:59.630
Okay, can you please come here
and sit down?

13:59.713 --> 14:00.756
Okay?

14:00.839 --> 14:02.007
I'm just going to come clean

14:02.091 --> 14:03.008
with you here.

14:03.092 --> 14:05.761
Alright, total honesty.

14:05.844 --> 14:07.429
Now, I have never
told you this before

14:07.513 --> 14:10.683
but I have a serious illness.

14:11.559 --> 14:12.851
Oh, my God. What?

14:14.186 --> 14:15.729
I don't know yet.

14:17.106 --> 14:20.442
But it is just lurking inside of
me waiting to come out

14:20.526 --> 14:22.945
at some moment
when I least expect it.

14:23.028 --> 14:25.614
And if that moment
should happen at some odd hour

14:25.698 --> 14:28.951
or in a foreign country
like Mexico

14:29.034 --> 14:32.162
I wanna make sure there's a
doctor by my side at all times.

14:32.246 --> 14:34.623
Now, doesn't someone feel silly?

14:41.463 --> 14:43.340
Val said
I wrecked my whole future.

14:45.342 --> 14:47.970
I just think that saying
that I wrecked my whole future

14:48.053 --> 14:49.972
is kind of an overreaction.

14:50.055 --> 14:51.307
Well, what are you gonna do?

14:51.390 --> 14:53.142
You're obviously not
gonna go to Columbia.

14:53.225 --> 14:55.311
I don't know. Well, maybe
I'll just take a year off

14:55.394 --> 14:56.895
and hang out with Tina.

14:56.979 --> 14:58.188
I'm not hanging out.

14:58.272 --> 14:59.690
For the first six months
I'm gonna work

14:59.773 --> 15:01.609
in an animal shelter
and then I have a job

15:01.692 --> 15:03.402
at a vet's office in Tribeca.

15:03.485 --> 15:04.820
Wait a minute.

15:04.903 --> 15:07.031
So all these times
that we say goodbye

15:07.114 --> 15:08.657
and I go home
and listen to music

15:08.741 --> 15:11.118
you guys are
actually doing stuff?

15:12.494 --> 15:14.705
Alright, alright.
What is your backup plan?

15:14.788 --> 15:18.000
Oh, my God. You have
backup plans, too?

15:18.083 --> 15:19.460
You don't have a backup plan?

15:19.543 --> 15:20.919
No, but I never thought
I'd need it.

15:21.003 --> 15:24.173
It was always Columbia,
Columbia, Columbia.

15:24.256 --> 15:26.342
And the worst part is
Val so had her heart

15:26.425 --> 15:27.843
set on me going there.

15:27.926 --> 15:29.428
Yeah, well,
my brother's the same way.

15:29.511 --> 15:31.430
He was all excited
about me going to his school.

15:31.513 --> 15:32.681
He even made me go on a tour.

15:32.765 --> 15:34.183
My mom did that, too.

15:34.266 --> 15:36.352
God, what is it with people
and their colleges?

15:36.435 --> 15:39.313
I guess it's like you're
keeping their past alive.

15:39.396 --> 15:41.357
Now, I don't want
his old sad-ass memories.

15:41.440 --> 15:43.942
I want my own sad-ass memories.

15:44.026 --> 15:45.319
So is that why you're going to
NYU instead of

15:45.402 --> 15:46.695
your brother's school?

15:46.779 --> 15:48.405
Well, that and he went
to beauty school.

15:51.617 --> 15:53.077
[instrumental music]

16:05.130 --> 16:08.676
Oh, hi. You must be,
uh, Perdita Jasay.

16:11.679 --> 16:12.930
Jasai..

16:13.013 --> 16:15.516
Yes, I am Perdita Jasai.

16:15.599 --> 16:16.809
You're early. I like that.

16:16.892 --> 16:18.185
Why don't you, uh,
just close the door

16:18.268 --> 16:19.311
and we'll get started?

16:19.395 --> 16:20.604
Okay.

16:22.481 --> 16:24.566
Oh, why don't you tell me
something about yourself

16:24.650 --> 16:25.776
uh, Perdita?

16:25.859 --> 16:27.277
That's a pretty name.
What does it mean?

16:27.361 --> 16:29.738
Holly Tyler.

16:29.822 --> 16:33.283
Yeah, that's right.
I'm actually not Perdita Jasai.

16:33.367 --> 16:34.576
I don't understand.

16:34.660 --> 16:35.911
Dr. Thompkins, my interview was

16:35.994 --> 16:37.454
supposed to be yesterday
and I missed it

16:37.538 --> 16:39.164
so I've been trying to
reschedule--

16:39.248 --> 16:40.958
Oh, yeah, you're gonna have to
call the admissions office.

16:41.041 --> 16:43.460
I already tried. I can't get
anything until next year.

16:43.544 --> 16:46.588
Well, that's probably because
there are 15,000 other people

16:46.672 --> 16:47.923
trying to get in
this school, too.

16:48.006 --> 16:49.091
I mean, these are the applicants

16:49.174 --> 16:50.634
I have to see just today.

16:50.718 --> 16:52.594
Well, Perdita's not due
for another seven minutes.

16:52.678 --> 16:53.971
Can we just get to know
each other real fast?

16:54.054 --> 16:55.764
I'm sorry.
Look, maybe next year.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.099
No, I can't talk
about next year.

16:57.182 --> 16:59.101
It has to be this year.
This is too important.

16:59.184 --> 17:00.185
Look, I really don't think--

17:00.269 --> 17:01.186
Dr. Thompkins

17:01.270 --> 17:02.396
you could be making

17:02.479 --> 17:03.897
the biggest mistake
of your life.

17:03.981 --> 17:05.315
I mean, if I walk out that door

17:05.398 --> 17:06.608
you may never see me again

17:06.692 --> 17:07.608
and look at all the people

17:07.693 --> 17:08.944
that went to this school.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.654
Teddy and Franklin D. Roosevelt

17:10.738 --> 17:13.156
Caroline Kennedy,
Amelia Earhart

17:13.240 --> 17:14.450
Brian Dennehy

17:14.532 --> 17:16.410
not to mention
Grammy Award winners

17:16.492 --> 17:17.953
Alicia Keys and Lauryn Hill.

17:18.037 --> 17:20.455
What if they had missed
their college interviews, huh?

17:20.539 --> 17:22.290
I don't think you wanna
take that chance, sir.

17:22.374 --> 17:23.625
I don't think you do.

17:26.044 --> 17:28.338
Alright. You've got five minutes
to win me over.

17:28.422 --> 17:29.631
Okay. Thank you.

17:29.715 --> 17:31.467
My sister Val
graduated from this school

17:31.550 --> 17:32.676
and she and I have
talked about me

17:32.760 --> 17:34.011
going here since I was seven.

17:34.094 --> 17:36.096
I've never even considered
another school

17:36.180 --> 17:39.057
and as far as I'm concerned,
there are no other schools.

17:39.141 --> 17:40.809
Look, I don't have
your SAT scores

17:40.893 --> 17:42.394
in front of me,
how did you do?

17:42.478 --> 17:44.897
Oh, I think I got, uh..

17:44.980 --> 17:46.064
a 1600.

17:46.148 --> 17:47.483
You know, I can get them.

17:47.566 --> 17:49.067
About those scores..

17:49.151 --> 17:52.321
There's a reason
that they won't blow you away

17:52.404 --> 17:53.697
because the day of the test

17:53.781 --> 17:55.699
something really
horrible happened.

17:55.783 --> 17:57.451
And totally unexpected.

17:57.534 --> 18:00.496
Oh, no. What?

18:00.579 --> 18:03.165
The questions were really hard.

18:03.248 --> 18:04.458
Ha ha ha ha.

18:06.293 --> 18:08.045
So am I in?

18:18.263 --> 18:19.515
Hey, what are you doing?

18:19.598 --> 18:20.933
Thinking.

18:21.016 --> 18:22.267
Come on, really.

18:24.102 --> 18:25.354
I've made a decision.

18:25.437 --> 18:27.856
I have to break up with Brad.

18:27.940 --> 18:30.818
I took a long, hard look
at the pro and con list

18:30.901 --> 18:33.070
and I realized
there was only one pro.

18:33.153 --> 18:34.863
The only reason
it looked like a lot

18:34.947 --> 18:36.657
was because I wrote
the word "Doctor"

18:36.740 --> 18:40.077
really huge
with a big fat Marks-A-Lot.

18:40.160 --> 18:41.745
I'm really sorry.

18:41.829 --> 18:43.664
Yeah, I guess I'm going
to have to tell him.

18:43.747 --> 18:45.541
Oh, God, I just can't.

18:45.624 --> 18:47.042
No, you can do it.
It'll be okay.

18:47.125 --> 18:48.085
Just let him down easy.

18:48.168 --> 18:49.086
No, it's not that.

18:49.169 --> 18:50.087
I don't wanna see that

18:50.170 --> 18:52.256
white spit dot again.

18:56.176 --> 18:57.761
[instrumental music]

19:06.645 --> 19:07.729
Hey.

19:07.813 --> 19:09.982
- Hey.
- Okay, don't get all excited.

19:10.065 --> 19:12.109
But guess where I just spent the
last hour.

19:12.192 --> 19:13.735
Well, you've got
finals coming up

19:13.819 --> 19:15.612
so I'm guessing...Funland?

19:16.822 --> 19:18.740
No, I went to my
Columbia interview.

19:18.824 --> 19:20.993
I decided that
if they won't reschedule me

19:21.076 --> 19:22.244
I'll reschedule them.

19:22.327 --> 19:23.912
So I marched in there,
no appointment

19:23.996 --> 19:26.665
and had a great conversation
with that Dr. Thompkins guy.

19:26.748 --> 19:27.791
He is so cool.

19:27.875 --> 19:29.501
Wait, you just barged in there?

19:29.585 --> 19:32.462
Oh, I did it up Perdita style.

19:32.546 --> 19:35.257
- Per-who?
- Dita. It doesn't matter.

19:35.340 --> 19:36.508
I can't believe you did that.

19:36.592 --> 19:38.468
I know. I did it,
and it went great.

19:38.552 --> 19:40.053
It went better
than I even imagined.

19:40.137 --> 19:41.889
[gasps]
Ooh, tell me.
Tell me everything.

19:41.972 --> 19:43.015
It was so fun.

19:43.098 --> 19:44.474
- And you know why, I think.
- Why?

19:44.558 --> 19:48.103
Because we spent the whole time
talking about me.

19:48.186 --> 19:49.688
- This is so exciting.
- I know.

19:49.771 --> 19:51.565
We talked
about my future and stuff

19:51.648 --> 19:53.108
and it kind of made me feel like

19:53.192 --> 19:54.902
I don't know, all grown up.

19:54.985 --> 19:56.528
Ooh, good, good.

19:56.612 --> 19:58.113
And then we just talked
about how I'm moving

19:58.196 --> 19:59.489
into that period of my life
where I have to be

19:59.573 --> 20:01.575
responsible for myself,
making my own decisions

20:01.658 --> 20:03.785
because, you know,
it's my future.

20:03.869 --> 20:05.787
It is.
It is your future.

20:05.871 --> 20:07.873
So I made my first
big decision.

20:07.956 --> 20:11.293
- What?
- I'm not going to Columbia.

20:11.376 --> 20:12.711
Heh?

20:12.794 --> 20:15.672
Val, I know how much
you wanted me to go there

20:15.756 --> 20:16.924
and it's a great school

20:17.007 --> 20:18.592
but it's your school
and your memories

20:18.675 --> 20:21.511
and I want my own memories
and my own experiences.

20:21.595 --> 20:24.139
Okay, you have been dreaming
about going there

20:24.222 --> 20:26.475
ever since I was
a little girl.

20:26.558 --> 20:27.976
Alright, please listen.

20:28.060 --> 20:31.146
When Dr. Thompkins asked me
why I wanted to go to Columbia

20:31.230 --> 20:33.857
do you know what I said?
"I don't know."

20:33.941 --> 20:36.068
Aw, we rehearsed that.

20:37.527 --> 20:41.031
Val, it's just that Gary is
so excited about going to NYU

20:41.114 --> 20:43.408
and Tina's so excited
about taking time off

20:43.492 --> 20:45.869
and I want to be excited
about what I wanna do.

20:45.953 --> 20:47.621
Okay, what do you wanna do?

20:47.704 --> 20:50.958
I don't know,
but isn't that exciting?

20:51.041 --> 20:53.293
No, unh-unh.

20:53.377 --> 20:56.505
Okay, what I'm hearing
here is, uh..

20:56.588 --> 20:57.923
...you don't wanna go
to Columbia

20:58.006 --> 20:59.800
and you're very excited
about your future

20:59.883 --> 21:01.385
although you have
no idea what it is.

21:01.468 --> 21:03.053
Yes.

21:03.136 --> 21:05.514
And you don't wanna
go to Columbia.

21:05.597 --> 21:07.140
No.

21:07.224 --> 21:09.184
Brian Dennehy went there.

21:12.145 --> 21:13.689
Hey.
Oh, so I heard.

21:13.772 --> 21:15.524
Did you break up
with the, uh, doctor?

21:15.607 --> 21:18.360
Well, not so much
break up as..

21:18.443 --> 21:20.904
I'm engaged!
Ha ha ha!
