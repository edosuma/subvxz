WEBVTT

02:28.940 --> 02:30.567
- Thank you
for your patience

02:30.650 --> 02:31.985
with our lengthy
vetting process.

02:32.068 --> 02:33.528
It's very important
that we test

02:33.611 --> 02:35.613
for any indications
of claustrophobia.

02:35.697 --> 02:37.615
- Oh, I've been content.

02:37.699 --> 02:39.325
- You've been here
for seven days.

02:39.409 --> 02:41.244
You're actually
the first candidate

02:41.327 --> 02:43.413
to not ask when
you'd be released.

02:43.496 --> 02:45.748
Impressive.
All your scores are.

02:45.832 --> 02:48.251
- Oh, thank you.

02:48.334 --> 02:49.711
Is this the next portion
of my interview?

02:49.794 --> 02:51.421
- This is the next portion
of your life.

02:51.504 --> 02:54.549
Congratulations, Jasper.
You're going to the Hub.

02:54.632 --> 02:56.384
- Wow.
Thank you.

02:56.467 --> 02:58.887
This is a dream come true.

03:00.346 --> 03:02.056
What's this?
- We can't disclose

03:02.140 --> 03:05.602
the location of the Hub
even to its employees.

03:05.685 --> 03:08.479
So once you take this pill,
we'll transport you.

03:08.563 --> 03:10.815
- J-just...

03:11.774 --> 03:13.234
Okay.

03:15.987 --> 03:19.240
- You should probably sit down.
It works fast.

03:19.324 --> 03:21.492
- Oh.

03:33.796 --> 03:36.466
- Hazel, Hazel,
I gotta tell you something.

03:36.549 --> 03:37.717
- Hmm.

03:37.800 --> 03:39.677
- Okay, I keep dozing off

03:39.761 --> 03:41.429
and waking up
a few minutes later,

03:41.512 --> 03:45.391
but inside, it feels
like hours have passed.

03:45.475 --> 03:47.143
I started doing the math.

03:47.226 --> 03:48.895
And...

03:48.978 --> 03:51.272
there's no easy way
to say this.

03:51.356 --> 03:53.191
We're losing time.

03:56.986 --> 03:58.655
- Diane,
are you losing time too?

03:58.738 --> 03:59.656
- I don't know what it is.

03:59.739 --> 04:00.990
Is it a government thing

04:01.074 --> 04:03.785
or some kind
of parallel dimension?

04:03.868 --> 04:05.662
- Maybe it's the microwave.

04:05.745 --> 04:07.330
- Okay, then, explain why

04:07.413 --> 04:10.458
I'm getting erections
in all hours of the day.

04:10.541 --> 04:12.043
Huh, at my age?

04:12.126 --> 04:14.837
That only happens
usually when I wake up.

04:14.921 --> 04:16.005
- Come on, Dad, that's--

04:16.089 --> 04:17.507
that's TMI.

04:17.590 --> 04:20.843
- The weird clues--
they just kept piling up.

04:20.927 --> 04:23.805
Right, the great plumbing,
the truck going out.

04:23.888 --> 04:27.350
Your annoying little friend
Bangles not coming around.

04:27.433 --> 04:28.685
But then...

04:28.768 --> 04:31.479
then I found proof.

04:32.605 --> 04:34.649
This is one of those
military atomic watches.

04:34.732 --> 04:35.984
It's never wrong.

04:36.067 --> 04:38.277
Okay.
Our clocks--they say01.

04:38.361 --> 04:40.363
But look at the watch.

04:40.446 --> 04:42.949
42.

04:48.121 --> 04:51.040
- So you think
the Sun is broken,

04:51.124 --> 04:54.627
not the watch that
you've had for 50 years?

04:57.005 --> 04:59.215
- It's just...

04:59.298 --> 05:01.592
something's off.

05:03.052 --> 05:04.804
I don't know, it...

05:04.887 --> 05:06.597
don't make sense.

05:08.725 --> 05:10.768
- Are you feeling okay?

05:10.852 --> 05:12.979
- What--yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:15.314 --> 05:17.108
Wait here.

05:19.902 --> 05:23.573
I don't have
the flush of youth any longer.

05:23.656 --> 05:25.074
- What is this?

05:25.158 --> 05:27.952
- And just so you know,
I, uh--

05:28.036 --> 05:31.080
I changed the will.

05:31.164 --> 05:34.292
Before, I thought that
you didn't need this place,

05:34.375 --> 05:36.252
but now that
you're desperate again...

05:40.840 --> 05:42.967
- Are trying
to tell me something, Dad?

05:44.552 --> 05:46.971
Are you sick?

05:50.850 --> 05:52.268
- No.

05:52.351 --> 05:54.228
No.

05:54.312 --> 05:56.522
You just--you never know,
right?

05:56.606 --> 05:59.192
At my age, right?
It's good to be prepared.

06:03.738 --> 06:06.949
- Yeah, well, you know what?
Um...

06:07.033 --> 06:08.993
why don't we plan
your death later?

06:09.077 --> 06:11.245
I gotta go to work.

06:11.329 --> 06:13.122
Don't forget
your cholesterol pills.

06:13.206 --> 06:14.373
Yeah.

06:22.673 --> 06:24.425
- Hey, Bruce.

06:24.509 --> 06:27.804
So, I need you to, um...

06:27.887 --> 06:30.014
go see my friend Bangles
in Twin Sands

06:30.098 --> 06:31.307
and show her that video

06:31.390 --> 06:33.518
and, um, then bring her
back here.

06:33.601 --> 06:35.561
My dad's getting
a little suspicious,

06:35.645 --> 06:38.397
so I think that,
like, you know,

06:38.481 --> 06:40.316
someone from town
dropping by the house

06:40.399 --> 06:43.027
would be pretty helpful.

06:43.111 --> 06:45.947
And--and before
you say anything,

06:46.030 --> 06:47.406
I'm allowed to do this.

06:47.490 --> 06:51.452
So you don't have
to check in with Byron.

06:51.536 --> 06:53.121
You can just go.

06:58.251 --> 06:59.794
Good.

07:03.381 --> 07:04.799
Hi.

07:07.552 --> 07:10.304
What's your name?

07:10.388 --> 07:12.014
Keefus.

07:12.098 --> 07:14.642
- Why don't you wanna talk
to me?

07:16.811 --> 07:19.522
Seen you around here
for, like, years.

07:19.605 --> 07:22.150
- Didn't wanna bother you,
Mrs. Gogol.

07:26.237 --> 07:28.865
- Zelda!

07:29.991 --> 07:32.285
Hi!

07:32.368 --> 07:33.911
Hey!

07:35.830 --> 07:37.790
Nice going.
You scared her off.

07:37.874 --> 07:40.418
- Oh, I, uh--
Zelda's not--

07:40.501 --> 07:42.545
- I'm just fucking with you.

07:43.796 --> 07:45.339
Did you really
not wanna bother me,

07:45.423 --> 07:47.300
or did Byron tell you
not to talk to me?

07:47.383 --> 07:49.719
- Hazel.
Hello, Keefus.

07:49.802 --> 07:53.222
- Keefus and I were just
talking about orgasm reviews.

07:53.306 --> 07:54.807
- No.

07:54.891 --> 07:56.142
- I'd like to invite you

07:56.225 --> 07:57.768
to orientation
with the new recruits,

07:57.852 --> 08:00.313
and I was thinking
you should come.

08:00.396 --> 08:02.690
- Okay.
- Really?

08:02.773 --> 08:04.066
- Yeah.

08:04.150 --> 08:06.110
- Do you wanna change or...

08:06.194 --> 08:09.238
- No.
- Gr--yeah, you look good.

08:16.537 --> 08:19.415
You look really nice.

08:22.001 --> 08:24.587
- Thank you.

08:24.670 --> 08:26.589
I made these myself.

08:26.672 --> 08:29.217
I made you some too.

08:34.889 --> 08:37.934
I don't know
how to get them to you.

08:38.017 --> 08:40.937
- If you can make clothes,
I can make a door.

08:56.619 --> 08:58.704
I wanna build
a whole world for you.

09:18.808 --> 09:20.643
Who changed my clothes?

09:20.726 --> 09:22.853
Who changed my clothes?

09:33.656 --> 09:35.449
What?

09:35.533 --> 09:37.159
I'm in the Hub.

09:37.243 --> 09:39.704
- Coffee, honey?

09:42.248 --> 09:44.000
- Paula?
- Welcome.

09:44.083 --> 09:45.334
I'm your virtual assistant.

09:45.418 --> 09:47.503
Oh, shit.

09:47.586 --> 09:49.714
I mean, uh, sure.

09:51.841 --> 09:53.509
Oh...

09:58.806 --> 10:00.182
What?

10:00.266 --> 10:01.434
Why?

10:01.517 --> 10:03.352
- Fresh shave
for a fresh start.

10:11.277 --> 10:12.695
- Oh.

10:16.073 --> 10:17.408
Oh, that's delicious.

10:17.491 --> 10:20.161
- I know how you like it.

10:20.244 --> 10:22.079
- Allow me
to introduce myself.

10:22.163 --> 10:24.040
I'm your plus-one in the Hub.

10:24.123 --> 10:26.792
I'm here to answer questions,
help you get settled in,

10:26.876 --> 10:28.961
make sure you never
get lonely.

10:29.045 --> 10:30.171
Whatever you need...

10:30.254 --> 10:31.505
Honey, I gotcha.

10:31.589 --> 10:33.132
What would you like
to name me?

10:33.215 --> 10:35.384
- Any doors in this place?
- Anydoors.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.595
I like it.
- Oh, no, I wasn't trying to--

10:37.678 --> 10:39.013
I didn't even--

10:39.096 --> 10:40.556
- Oh, orientation's
in ten minutes.

10:40.639 --> 10:42.892
We gotta get you zipped up.

10:43.642 --> 10:45.394
Okay.

10:45.478 --> 10:48.856
- Today is the first day

10:48.939 --> 10:51.567
of the rest of your lives

10:51.650 --> 10:56.322
because you've just become
part of the "Gogol Gamily."

10:56.405 --> 10:57.907
And here,

10:57.990 --> 11:00.951
we like to say "gamily"
instead of "family"

11:01.035 --> 11:03.829
because Gogol starts with a G.

11:06.957 --> 11:09.919
And now we have a welcome video
from someone...

11:10.002 --> 11:12.463
Very special.

11:17.468 --> 11:19.553
- Hmm...

11:19.637 --> 11:21.013
Oh, hey there.

11:21.097 --> 11:22.765
You surprised us.

11:22.848 --> 11:24.517
I'm joking, it's just me.

11:24.600 --> 11:26.519
If you're watching this video,

11:26.602 --> 11:28.396
you're already inside the Hub,

11:28.479 --> 11:32.358
and you have chosen
to make it your home forever.

11:32.441 --> 11:34.235
As new Hub employees,

11:34.318 --> 11:36.237
you have been
hand-selected to join

11:36.320 --> 11:39.031
Gogol's extraordinary path
to eternal living.

11:39.115 --> 11:43.327
Here, at the Hub,
the next frontier isn't space.

11:43.411 --> 11:44.995
It is time.

11:45.079 --> 11:48.165
We're opening doors
to infinity.

11:48.249 --> 11:50.418
- So that means
just working here

11:50.501 --> 11:53.129
puts us on a path
to live forever?

11:53.212 --> 11:54.422
Wow!

11:54.505 --> 11:55.965
What a dream job.

11:56.048 --> 11:58.676
- Except it's not a dream,
Bennett.

11:58.759 --> 12:00.761
- It's reality!

12:02.805 --> 12:04.682
Welcome to the Hub!

12:07.226 --> 12:08.727
Yes, yes.

12:08.811 --> 12:10.312
Thank you, thank you, thank
you, thank you, thank you.

12:10.396 --> 12:12.898
We are thrilled
to have all you here.

12:12.982 --> 12:15.401
You--you are the chosen ones.

12:15.484 --> 12:17.194
And I would like
to now introduce

12:17.278 --> 12:19.822
my wife and partner
in all things,

12:19.905 --> 12:21.198
Hazel Gogol.

12:22.950 --> 12:24.326
Mrs. G.

12:24.410 --> 12:25.536
Mrs. G, everybody--

12:25.619 --> 12:27.788
- Ah, ah, ah, ah.

12:30.916 --> 12:32.293
- Thank you.

12:33.711 --> 12:36.213
Steve, thank you so much
for being here.

12:36.297 --> 12:38.340
Absolute honor.

12:38.424 --> 12:40.259
- Jasper, welcome to the Hub.
- Thank you.

12:40.342 --> 12:41.510
- Wow, you are tall
and attractive.

12:41.594 --> 12:42.720
- Thank you.
- I'm not gonna

12:42.803 --> 12:44.180
have you shake my wife's hand.

12:45.347 --> 12:46.849
I'm joking, I'm joking.

12:46.932 --> 12:48.267
- Okay.

12:48.350 --> 12:49.602
Right.

12:49.685 --> 12:51.479
It's nice to meet you,
Mrs. Gogol.

12:55.691 --> 12:57.234
- Oh, my gosh.

12:57.318 --> 12:59.320
That--that was great, right?

12:59.403 --> 13:00.905
I mean,
I want you to get a taste

13:00.988 --> 13:02.990
of what it would be like
for us to work together--

13:03.073 --> 13:05.451
- I think I left
my sunglasses in there.

13:05.534 --> 13:07.161
- Oh, I'll have Bennett--
- No, that's okay.

13:07.244 --> 13:09.371
I'm just gonna go get them
because I need to have them

13:09.455 --> 13:11.081
for when I see
my dad again later.

13:11.165 --> 13:12.666
- Have dinner with me.

13:12.750 --> 13:15.044
I mean, we just have
such a small amount of time

13:15.127 --> 13:18.214
before your dad gets better,
and I...

13:18.297 --> 13:19.924
- Yeah.

13:20.007 --> 13:21.425
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:21.509 --> 13:24.011
I mean, you know,
I'm in here, already.

13:24.094 --> 13:25.054
So ye--okay.

13:25.137 --> 13:26.055
- Okay.

13:26.138 --> 13:27.723
Great.

13:27.806 --> 13:29.058
It's a date.

13:31.477 --> 13:34.730
- You never know when you're
gonna get a glimpse of Byron.

13:34.813 --> 13:36.690
It's kind of like walking
around Disney World,

13:36.774 --> 13:38.984
just knowing that Mickey
is right around the corner.

13:39.068 --> 13:41.028
Oh, hey, Mrs. G.
- Hi.

13:41.111 --> 13:42.613
I left my sunglasses in here,
I think.

13:42.696 --> 13:44.907
- Oh, no, you were not
wearing sunglasses.

13:44.990 --> 13:47.409
There's no sun down here.
We are underground.

13:47.493 --> 13:49.495
- I had 'em with me.
- Well, luckily,

13:49.578 --> 13:51.497
our smart lenses
have location technology.

13:51.580 --> 13:53.249
- No, these
were regular sunglasses.

13:53.332 --> 13:54.542
- No smart lenses?

13:54.625 --> 13:55.960
Why wouldn't
you use our smart lenses?

13:56.043 --> 13:57.628
- Because I don't like
smart lenses!

14:00.172 --> 14:02.174
We joke around a lot.
- That's not true.

14:02.258 --> 14:03.509
- Yeah, we have fun.

14:03.592 --> 14:05.261
- We do?

14:05.344 --> 14:07.846
- They are my favorite pair.

14:07.930 --> 14:09.598
So, can we...
- Yeah. So if everyone

14:09.682 --> 14:11.600
wants to help out,
take a gander.

14:11.684 --> 14:12.768
- Thank you.

14:12.851 --> 14:14.937
Um...

14:17.690 --> 14:19.358
- Can you
meet me here alone later?

14:19.441 --> 14:21.777
- Yeah,
I have a break at00.

14:24.196 --> 14:26.699
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

14:26.782 --> 14:28.867
- I found 'em.

14:28.951 --> 14:30.077
Reunited.

14:30.160 --> 14:31.287
Ooh!

14:31.370 --> 14:34.582
Well, with that,
I... I bid you adieu.

14:34.665 --> 14:36.875
- Now I hope everyone's
feeling hungry,

14:36.959 --> 14:39.044
because these
27-millimeter spheres

14:39.128 --> 14:41.463
contain the flavor
and nutrients

14:41.547 --> 14:43.966
of a 36-ounce dry-aged ribeye.

14:48.721 --> 14:50.306
- Mystique here dirties panties

14:50.389 --> 14:52.266
about as fast
as I can wash 'em.

14:52.349 --> 14:55.686
- Dude, why does your doll
look so much like me?

14:55.769 --> 14:57.396
- I based her looks
on economics.

14:57.479 --> 14:59.106
Discount for
the dented forehead.

14:59.189 --> 15:01.525
- Yeah, right.
She's practically my twin.

15:01.609 --> 15:03.110
Except for the arms

15:03.193 --> 15:04.695
and the legs.

15:04.778 --> 15:06.030
- Look, I'm on a layaway plan

15:06.113 --> 15:07.531
for the non-essential parts,
okay?

15:07.615 --> 15:09.867
I should have at least
one arm by January.

15:09.950 --> 15:11.660
- What?

15:11.744 --> 15:13.829
- But she's sure
all woman where it counts.

15:13.912 --> 15:15.581
- Show me her butt.

15:15.664 --> 15:18.208
If she has my tattoo,
you're dead.

15:18.292 --> 15:20.210
- Bangles de la Morga?

15:20.294 --> 15:22.212
I'm here on behalf
of Hazel Gogol.

15:22.296 --> 15:23.672
She said to show you
this video.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.257
- Hey, lady!

15:25.341 --> 15:27.092
- How do I know this is
actually from Hazel,

15:27.176 --> 15:29.511
and not some deepfake
Illuminati edit job?

15:29.595 --> 15:33.515
- I need
to ask you a huge favor.

15:33.599 --> 15:35.017
- Oh yeah, it's her.
- This, like,

15:35.100 --> 15:36.769
creepy tall man
is gonna come get you...

15:36.852 --> 15:39.021
- Well, he's not that creepy.

15:39.104 --> 15:41.315
- Uh, to bring you
to--to me in the Hub.

15:41.398 --> 15:44.026
It's kind of a long story,
but my dad is in here too.

15:44.109 --> 15:45.861
But he can't know
that he's in here.

15:45.944 --> 15:49.323
And, uh, so, I need you
to come to convince him

15:49.406 --> 15:51.867
that he is
definitely not in here.

15:51.950 --> 15:53.494
- She's not making any sense.

15:53.577 --> 15:55.204
Just tell her I'm way
too high for this shit.

15:55.287 --> 15:56.872
Thanks.

15:56.955 --> 15:58.290
- And if you do, I will

15:58.374 --> 16:00.793
wire $100,000
into your bank account.

16:00.876 --> 16:02.211
- 100 grand.

16:02.294 --> 16:04.046
- Wait, how long does it take
to get there?

16:04.129 --> 16:05.964
I just--I have a raging UTI
right now,

16:06.048 --> 16:07.966
so I'm gonna have to take
a million bathroom breaks.

16:08.050 --> 16:09.134
- Take one of these.

16:09.218 --> 16:10.427
The journey will fly by.

16:10.511 --> 16:12.554
- I'll do it.

16:12.638 --> 16:14.390
This one's for us, Mystique.

16:16.266 --> 16:18.560
- Oh, my...

16:18.644 --> 16:19.561
God.

16:26.151 --> 16:27.653
What?

16:55.264 --> 16:57.266
- We finally got one!
- Yes.

16:58.726 --> 16:59.643
Run!

16:59.727 --> 17:01.103
Run!

17:01.186 --> 17:03.105
- Come on!

17:03.188 --> 17:04.982
- I can't run without my shoes!

17:05.065 --> 17:06.108
Get outta the way!

17:08.986 --> 17:10.946
- Bennett, this date is a start

17:11.029 --> 17:12.656
of a whole new beginning,
it's...

17:12.740 --> 17:14.199
- And I've already started
planning it, sir.

17:14.283 --> 17:15.826
- Good, good, good, good.
- These are the top

17:15.909 --> 17:17.661
image associations
for the word "romance"

17:17.745 --> 17:19.913
for women in Hazel's
general demographic.

17:19.997 --> 17:21.832
- Great, great.
I'm seeing a lot of candles.

17:21.915 --> 17:23.375
I like that.
- Mm-hmm, and as we know,

17:23.459 --> 17:25.502
picnics.
- Candlelit picnic.

17:25.586 --> 17:27.337
It is, right?
It doesn't have to make sense.

17:27.421 --> 17:28.797
I mean,
we could sit on the ground,

17:28.881 --> 17:30.215
eat dinner together like dogs,

17:30.299 --> 17:32.384
and then maybe my wife
will love me again.

17:32.468 --> 17:34.178
- And, oh,
what if we got some books

17:34.261 --> 17:36.305
of love poetry weighing down
the corners of the blankets?

17:36.388 --> 17:38.682
And what if I rushed ordered
a string quartet,

17:38.766 --> 17:40.684
and potentially,
I could sing over them?

17:40.768 --> 17:43.979
- Yeah, I just want it
to be nice, but...

17:44.062 --> 17:46.815
I want--I want her to see
that I'm trying.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.358
I just really want
to talk to her.

17:48.442 --> 17:51.153
- Well, these are
the top image associations

17:51.236 --> 17:53.989
for the phrase
"vulnerable man."

17:54.072 --> 17:56.033
And...

17:56.116 --> 17:58.535
Oh, I'm seeing
lots of guys with beards.

17:58.619 --> 18:01.246
You know, I wish we got
this memo a few weeks ago.

18:01.330 --> 18:03.332
It is too late now.

18:06.460 --> 18:07.961
What's wrong, sir?

18:09.004 --> 18:11.882
- What if Hazel
doesn't even care?

18:13.592 --> 18:15.636
Yeah, that is a good beard.

18:15.719 --> 18:17.137
It's, uh... yeah.
- Yes.

18:20.265 --> 18:21.433
- Hey, hi.

18:21.517 --> 18:22.518
Bangles.

18:22.601 --> 18:23.936
Hey, it's me.
It's Hazel.

18:24.019 --> 18:26.688
- Holy shit.
This room is so clean.

18:26.772 --> 18:29.399
The lights are weird.
Oh, my God.

18:29.483 --> 18:31.193
Are we in outer space?

18:31.276 --> 18:33.237
- Yeah. Ha.

18:35.823 --> 18:38.033
- Holy shit.
Why aren't we floating?

18:38.116 --> 18:39.701
- No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, we're not--

18:39.785 --> 18:41.203
we're not in space.
This is...

18:41.286 --> 18:43.038
So this is a medical cube.

18:45.582 --> 18:46.917
I feel amazing.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.294
- Yeah, there is, like,
a intake body scan.

18:49.378 --> 18:52.381
- Are you saying
my herpes is cured?

18:52.464 --> 18:53.632
- I didn't say that.

18:53.715 --> 18:55.217
Anyway, I brought you here
because

18:55.300 --> 18:57.553
my father has cancer.
- Look,

18:57.636 --> 18:58.929
if you want me
to sleep with him

18:59.012 --> 19:01.098
as some sort of
Make-A-Wish deal...

19:01.181 --> 19:02.057
the answer's yes.

19:02.140 --> 19:03.809
- No, the Hub doctors

19:03.892 --> 19:05.269
are going to cure him.

19:05.352 --> 19:07.145
That's--did you watch
the video?

19:07.229 --> 19:09.481
That is why
I came back to the Hub.

19:09.565 --> 19:11.567
- Not 'cause you're tired
of slumming it?

19:11.650 --> 19:12.901
- No.

19:12.985 --> 19:16.113
This is a very temporary
arrangement, okay?

19:16.196 --> 19:17.281
We're gonna go.
Come on.

19:17.364 --> 19:18.740
We gotta go.
We gotta go.

19:18.824 --> 19:21.076
Oh, shit.

19:21.159 --> 19:22.578
I came here with Bruce.

19:22.661 --> 19:24.913
I don't have my finger sensor.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.707
- Don't worry, Mrs. G.

19:26.790 --> 19:29.793
I gotcha.

19:32.963 --> 19:34.214
- Okay.

19:39.261 --> 19:42.347
You want me to have
another one, don't you?

19:42.431 --> 19:45.601
Well, it's too early for that.

19:45.684 --> 19:46.894
On the other hand...

19:49.021 --> 19:52.107
Time is a social construct.

19:52.190 --> 19:54.443
That's fact, not opinion.

20:09.458 --> 20:10.959
Aah!

20:11.043 --> 20:13.253
- I can't do this.
I'm too fucking nervous.

20:13.337 --> 20:14.796
- Come on, you'll be fine.

20:14.880 --> 20:16.298
You'll be fine.
You lie all the time.

20:16.381 --> 20:18.467
- No, lying's your thing.
That's your thing.

20:18.550 --> 20:20.510
I'm just unstable.

20:23.055 --> 20:23.972
- One second!

20:25.057 --> 20:27.559
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:29.519 --> 20:31.813
Who's there?
What do you want?

20:31.897 --> 20:33.815
- It's Diane's gynecologist,

20:33.899 --> 20:36.026
here for her annual pap smear.

20:39.905 --> 20:41.323
- Why was the door locked?

20:41.406 --> 20:42.950
- What?
What's--what's going on?

20:43.033 --> 20:44.493
You girls
in some kind of trouble?

20:44.576 --> 20:47.746
- Oh, my gosh,
you made me a cocktail.

20:47.829 --> 20:50.374
- So, um, Bangles needs

20:50.457 --> 20:54.252
to borrow a, um...

20:54.336 --> 20:55.837
- A ladder.

20:55.921 --> 20:57.089
- Ladder?
- A ladder.

20:57.172 --> 20:59.007
S--right now.
Do we have it?

20:59.091 --> 21:00.509
Where is it?
- What're you--

21:00.592 --> 21:02.177
you're gonna walk three miles
back into town

21:02.260 --> 21:03.261
carrying a ladder?

21:03.345 --> 21:04.721
- There's two of us,

21:04.805 --> 21:07.057
but there'd be three
if you helped.

21:07.140 --> 21:08.809
- Yeah, dream on.

21:08.892 --> 21:10.018
Why?
What do you need it for?

21:10.102 --> 21:11.353
- Because...

21:11.436 --> 21:14.356
- My cat
got stuck up in a tree.

21:14.439 --> 21:15.524
- Yes.

21:15.607 --> 21:17.025
And so,
we need it right now.

21:17.109 --> 21:18.443
We gotta go.
There's an animal in distress.

21:18.527 --> 21:20.821
We gotta hustle.

21:23.991 --> 21:25.867
Thank you.

21:29.579 --> 21:30.580
A ladder?

21:30.664 --> 21:33.041
Seriously?

21:34.584 --> 21:36.044
- What are you
shoving down your pants?

21:36.128 --> 21:38.880
- It's a keycard.

21:38.964 --> 21:40.716
- You need
the metal or the wood?

21:40.799 --> 21:42.050
- Oh, the metal.
- Oh, the wood.

21:42.134 --> 21:44.177
You...

21:44.261 --> 21:45.387
- The wood.
- The metal.

21:59.234 --> 22:01.278
- Where the fuck is it?

22:05.741 --> 22:07.826
I think I'm losing it.

22:09.327 --> 22:12.205
- Thank you so much again
for coming, Bangles.

22:12.289 --> 22:13.498
Unfortunately--

22:15.167 --> 22:16.626
- Whoa.

22:16.710 --> 22:18.587
You live like a drug kingpin?

22:18.670 --> 22:22.424
- Listen, I promise
I will bring you back soon.

22:22.507 --> 22:25.093
But, you know,
unfortunately--

22:25.177 --> 22:26.595
what are you doing?

22:26.678 --> 22:28.722
- I have always
dreamed of peeing--

22:28.805 --> 22:32.100
I mean, swimming--
in an in-ground pool.

22:32.184 --> 22:33.351
Dreams really do come true.

22:33.435 --> 22:35.103
- I suck, I know.

22:35.187 --> 22:37.105
But something very unexpected
has happened this morning,

22:37.189 --> 22:39.024
and you gotta go right now.

22:39.107 --> 22:40.817
- I did not get drugged

22:40.901 --> 22:44.112
and smuggled
to Dexter's Laboratory

22:44.196 --> 22:46.114
for a five-minute,
no-fun visit.

22:46.198 --> 22:49.117
- You are being paid
$100,000, remember?

22:49.201 --> 22:51.620
That is $20,000 per minute.

22:54.581 --> 22:56.124
- I guess that's fair.

22:56.208 --> 22:57.459
- Good.

23:00.003 --> 23:02.089
Bangles, no!

23:07.010 --> 23:08.470
Stop!

23:08.553 --> 23:10.097
- Oh, come on.

23:12.390 --> 23:13.892
- Byron.

23:13.975 --> 23:15.185
- Hi, hi.

23:15.268 --> 23:16.311
What's going on here?

23:16.394 --> 23:18.313
- Meet Bangles. Ha.

23:18.396 --> 23:20.524
- I'm the one
who showed you my butthole

23:20.607 --> 23:23.360
when you were creeping
around in Hazel's eyes.

23:23.443 --> 23:24.820
- I remember.

23:27.239 --> 23:28.698
- I...

23:29.908 --> 23:31.993
I forgot about our dinner.
I'm sorry.

23:32.077 --> 23:33.495
- Yeah, fine.

23:33.578 --> 23:36.998
I-I just was hoping
that we would talk tonight.

23:37.082 --> 23:38.166
- Oh, yeah,
she won't stay long.

23:38.250 --> 23:39.918
- Yum!

23:40.001 --> 23:41.837
This is so romantic.

23:41.920 --> 23:43.547
- Thank you.
- I'm so horny for this.

23:43.630 --> 23:44.756
You did a great job.

23:56.268 --> 23:57.561
That's not bad.

23:57.644 --> 23:58.937
I'd have another.

23:59.020 --> 24:01.231
- Would you like it in a glass?

24:02.315 --> 24:04.067
The bottle's glass, stupid.

24:11.950 --> 24:14.536
All these fucking olives
have hard shit in 'em.

24:14.619 --> 24:15.871
- Hey.

24:15.954 --> 24:17.247
Do you remember
when I would have

24:17.330 --> 24:18.707
doubts about a boyfriend?

24:18.790 --> 24:22.085
- And then you would
have me flirt with them

24:22.169 --> 24:25.338
to see if they'd cheat,
and then they would,

24:25.422 --> 24:27.174
and so I ended up
having sex with, like,

24:27.257 --> 24:29.259
all these fucking scumbags
for you?

24:29.342 --> 24:30.385
Yeah, I remember.

24:30.468 --> 24:32.220
- I was talking about when

24:32.304 --> 24:33.889
you would interrogate them.

24:33.972 --> 24:35.223
- Oh, to see
if they're dirty liars.

24:35.307 --> 24:36.600
- Yes.

24:36.683 --> 24:38.476
Do you wanna do that
with Byron?

24:38.560 --> 24:41.771
I will leave, right?

24:41.855 --> 24:43.231
And then...

24:44.232 --> 24:47.319
But I'll--I'll come back.

24:47.402 --> 24:48.904
Okay.

24:56.661 --> 24:58.246
- Oh.

24:58.330 --> 25:00.790
Come have a seat, richie rich.

25:00.874 --> 25:02.250
- Where's Hazel?

25:02.334 --> 25:04.419
- I asked for a minute
of alone time

25:04.502 --> 25:06.630
'cause I have
some questions for you.

25:13.345 --> 25:15.513
Keep your distance.

25:18.850 --> 25:21.269
- So why'd you put
a chip in her brain?

25:21.353 --> 25:22.604
Are you a sociopath?

25:22.687 --> 25:24.105
- Are you?

25:24.189 --> 25:25.190
- It takes one to know one.

25:26.483 --> 25:28.693
Why don't you like to fuck?

25:30.028 --> 25:32.697
- Love the questions.

25:38.703 --> 25:40.247
Who are you?

25:42.290 --> 25:43.667
There's no surveillance
in here.

25:43.750 --> 25:46.002
- According to who?
- According to Byron.

25:46.086 --> 25:47.420
- And you trust that?

25:47.504 --> 25:50.382
- Apparently I can't
trust anyone, Jay.

25:52.175 --> 25:53.843
So you're Byron's spy?

25:53.927 --> 25:55.262
- No.

25:57.055 --> 25:59.182
I'm FBI.

25:59.266 --> 26:01.101
And my name's Jasper.

26:03.019 --> 26:05.105
- Do you love Hazel?

26:05.188 --> 26:06.731
- I do, despite
what she may think.

26:06.815 --> 26:07.983
Do you love Hazel?

26:08.066 --> 26:09.901
- Yeah, she's my best friend.

26:09.985 --> 26:12.362
Hey, you know
you could pull a Herbert,

26:12.445 --> 26:14.406
and you could just buy
another woman.

26:14.489 --> 26:17.826
- Let me go get you some water.

26:20.078 --> 26:22.414
Bennett.
- Psst, hey.

26:22.497 --> 26:24.082
Thought I'd stay close
in case you needed me.

26:24.165 --> 26:25.583
How it's going?
- Okay, little too close.

26:25.667 --> 26:27.002
- Oh, I'm sorry.
How's it going?

26:27.085 --> 26:29.170
- Where's Hazel?
- Big night, huh?

26:29.254 --> 26:30.880
- Where--where's Hazel?
- Oh, sorry.

26:32.757 --> 26:34.134
That's weird.

26:34.217 --> 26:37.053
Facial recognition
isn't placing her anywhere.

26:37.137 --> 26:39.055
- I think I know where she is.

26:39.139 --> 26:40.432
Take care of Bangles.

26:40.515 --> 26:41.808
- Huh?

26:52.944 --> 26:54.362
- Oh.

26:54.446 --> 26:55.864
It's you.

26:55.947 --> 26:58.074
Are you a virgin?

26:58.158 --> 26:59.200
- Uh...

26:59.284 --> 27:01.453
- Do you wanna 69?

27:01.536 --> 27:03.121
You ever done that before?

27:04.873 --> 27:06.875
How about some drugs?

27:06.958 --> 27:08.543
- Oho-hokay.

27:08.626 --> 27:10.045
Carrot Top likes to party.

27:10.128 --> 27:11.629
- Yeah.

27:11.713 --> 27:13.590
- What is that--okay,
these little pills?

27:13.673 --> 27:15.133
- Yeah, the blue one.

27:15.216 --> 27:17.177
- Oh, well,
I'll take one if you take one.

27:17.260 --> 27:18.845
- Mm-hmm, totally.
- Okay.

27:20.638 --> 27:21.973
- Bottoms up, come here.

27:23.350 --> 27:24.392
Mmm.

27:35.028 --> 27:36.237
- Everyone in here signs

27:36.321 --> 27:38.073
end-of-life agreements
like I did.

27:38.156 --> 27:40.408
So if they're alive
and trapped, we wouldn't know.

27:40.492 --> 27:43.078
And Herringbone was last seen
in a vehicle with Byron,

27:43.161 --> 27:45.538
so we believe he is in here.

27:45.622 --> 27:47.540
The FBI just hasn't
been able to track him.

27:47.624 --> 27:49.250
- Why are you telling me this?

27:49.334 --> 27:51.252
- I believe you want to take
him down just as bad as I do.

27:51.336 --> 27:53.505
- How do you know
that I won't rat you out?

27:53.588 --> 27:54.589
- I don't.

27:54.672 --> 27:56.132
- So what do you want me to do?

27:56.216 --> 27:57.384
- I need you
to find the people

27:57.467 --> 27:59.094
that we're looking for.

27:59.177 --> 28:01.262
Does the name Oz Wimmer
sound familiar?

28:01.346 --> 28:03.223
Or Pia Agarwal?

28:03.306 --> 28:05.225
- I don't really know
anyone in here.

28:05.308 --> 28:06.768
This week is the first time

28:06.851 --> 28:09.020
I've seen
any of the worker areas.

28:09.104 --> 28:10.730
I was basically trapped
in my home cube,

28:10.814 --> 28:12.816
and I wasn't really allowed
to walk around on my own.

28:12.899 --> 28:14.484
- So you were like a prisoner?

28:14.567 --> 28:17.237
- Yeah, um...

28:17.320 --> 28:20.323
but I've--I've got
a lot more access now.

28:20.407 --> 28:22.450
So, I--I can look around.

28:22.534 --> 28:24.119
What else?

28:24.202 --> 28:26.204
- I need you to exit the Hub.

28:26.287 --> 28:27.831
Contact the FBI.

28:27.914 --> 28:29.749
Do you know
how to get out of here?

28:29.833 --> 28:31.334
No.

28:56.401 --> 28:57.819
Byron...

28:57.902 --> 29:00.029
I thought
this was my sanctuary.

29:00.113 --> 29:01.865
- It is.
I'm sorry.

29:01.948 --> 29:03.575
Come back when you're ready.

29:16.754 --> 29:19.090
- Lil' sleepy magoo
looks almost angelic.

29:21.092 --> 29:22.677
- Ruh-roh.

29:29.893 --> 29:31.352
- Herbert's pills.
