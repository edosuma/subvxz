01:55.137 --> 01:56.870
Welcome! Welcome!

01:56.970 --> 02:00.203
Congrats, Drac.
Holy smokes, everybody's here.

02:01.003 --> 02:05.870
Mr. and Mrs. Loughran,
the parents of the groom, and family.

02:09.270 --> 02:10.803
- Mom and Dad!
- Johnny!

02:10.902 --> 02:13.103
I can't believe you're all here.

02:34.737 --> 02:37.570
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah!

02:37.670 --> 02:41.470
- Yo, how hot is my date?
- So hot.

02:41.570 --> 02:44.703
- How 'bout how hot mine is?
- You got a date?

02:44.803 --> 02:47.770
Yeah. She's invisible.
That's why you can't see her.

02:47.870 --> 02:50.937
Oh, right.
This is the one from "Canada"?

02:51.037 --> 02:52.203
Wedding's starting.

03:51.337 --> 03:53.237
Great.

04:00.070 --> 04:02.503
True. So true, Marty.

04:18.237 --> 04:20.269
How sweet.

04:22.003 --> 04:24.770
Oh, my. Look at you.

04:25.103 --> 04:27.303
Oh, my gosh.

04:40.770 --> 04:43.970
Is it everything you wanted,
my little poisonberry?

04:44.070 --> 04:48.437
Oh, it is, Daddy.
Except where's Grandpa Vlad?

04:48.537 --> 04:52.670
Honey, your gramps would not have
been cool with this. He's old-school.

04:52.770 --> 04:55.337
How do we know?
If he could just meet Johnny...

04:55.437 --> 04:59.670
He would have eaten him. He's not
as enlightened as your hip Daddy.

04:59.770 --> 05:03.070
So, you're really okay
with him not being a monster?

05:03.170 --> 05:08.503
Human, monster, unicorn,
as long as you're happy.

05:08.603 --> 05:10.603
Thanks, Dad.

05:12.303 --> 05:15.937
<i>And you'll always be my moonlight</i>

05:16.037 --> 05:19.637
<i>But now on wings of love you soar</i>

05:19.737 --> 05:22.737
<i>Now that you're Johnny's girl</i>

05:22.837 --> 05:26.503
<i>Johnny's girl and kind of Daddy's, too</i>

05:26.603 --> 05:30.803
<i>Your mom would be so happy
'cause she always knew</i>

05:30.903 --> 05:37.237
<i>Love is making room
for all the best in you?</i>

05:55.637 --> 06:00.170
- Hey, Dad.
- Oh, hey, guys! Todd, take a break.

06:03.170 --> 06:04.270
So, what's up?

06:04.370 --> 06:07.903
Mavis was wondering if maybe
you wanted to go for a fly.

06:08.003 --> 06:12.103
Oh. We haven't done that in forever.
Any special reason?

06:12.203 --> 06:14.803
No special reason at all.

06:14.903 --> 06:16.903
Right, Mavey?

06:17.003 --> 06:19.303
- What's his deal?
- He's silly.

06:19.403 --> 06:23.170
It's just a beautiful night, and...
Well, if you don't want to...

06:23.270 --> 06:27.637
No, no! Are you kidding? I would eat
a bucket of garlic to fly with you.

07:02.737 --> 07:05.503
Oh, honey, look at those fluffy clouds.

07:06.603 --> 07:09.137
Remember what we played
when you were little?

07:09.237 --> 07:12.003
Hide and Go Seek Sharp Objects?

07:13.003 --> 07:16.370
Okay. Regular Hide and Go Seek.

07:18.637 --> 07:21.070
Where are you?

07:23.070 --> 07:25.203
Honeybat!

07:26.503 --> 07:28.403
Mavey!

07:29.470 --> 07:31.503
Honeybat!

07:32.137 --> 07:35.237
I'm gonna get you.

07:40.270 --> 07:42.237
Honey? Are you okay?

07:42.337 --> 07:46.537
Yes. It's just a little harder
to catch my breath since I'm pregnant.

07:46.637 --> 07:50.470
Yes, well, I guess that
would make it more... What?

07:57.503 --> 08:00.737
I'm gonna be a grandpa!

08:01.670 --> 08:05.370
And I'm gonna be a dad!

08:06.037 --> 08:09.003
<i>'Cause you're Daddy's girl, or boy</i>

08:09.103 --> 08:12.037
<i>Daddy's girl, or boy</i>

08:12.137 --> 08:16.037
I'm hungry again, honey. Can you
get me some ice cream with anchovies?

08:17.803 --> 08:22.403
No, no, no. You mustn't give in to your
cravings. It's not good for the baby.

08:22.503 --> 08:26.203
You need to increase your spider intake,
so he'll be able to climb ceilings properly.

08:26.303 --> 08:28.970
And eat lots of sheep bile.

08:29.903 --> 08:33.602
I love you, Dad, but we don't even know
if the kid's gonna be a vampire.

08:33.703 --> 08:36.602
I'd be thrilled if the baby's human-y,
just like Johnny.

08:36.703 --> 08:41.337
"Human-y." With thousands of years
of Dracula genes. Not gonna happen.

08:41.437 --> 08:45.770
- As long as the baby's healthy.
- Of course. A healthy little vampire.

08:45.870 --> 08:49.770
- Or human.
- Yes, a human who can fly as a bat.

08:49.970 --> 08:54.903
Here. Just have some monster ball soup.
It's your mommy's recipe.

08:59.137 --> 09:05.370
Thank you, Dad. Just like you made it
when I was a kid. My favorite.

09:16.603 --> 09:17.670
Sorry.

09:32.337 --> 09:35.270
Sir, only the father is allowed
in the delivery room.

09:35.370 --> 09:40.537
Really? I mean, okay.
He's the family, I guess.

09:45.570 --> 09:48.703
Oh, look! It's a boy! It's a boy!

09:48.803 --> 09:52.170
The Dracula bloodline carries on!

09:52.370 --> 09:57.803
No one will ever harm you as long
as I'm here, my little devil dog.

09:58.103 --> 10:02.170
- Dad, can I hold my baby?
- If I were Dad, I'd say yes.

10:02.270 --> 10:07.137
But I'm the nurse, Francine.
Here you go anyway.

10:12.303 --> 10:15.837
My bad.

10:19.337 --> 10:22.137
Little Dennis is a year old now.

10:25.737 --> 10:29.003
Nice. Yeah. Cute kid.

10:30.803 --> 10:34.303
Okay, time for presents, guys.

10:34.403 --> 10:37.837
All right! Let's do this boy up!

10:37.937 --> 10:40.070
Check out what I got him. Bling!

10:41.170 --> 10:43.070
- Is it cursed?
- Super cursed.

10:43.170 --> 10:46.037
Only the best. Straight from the crypt.

10:46.137 --> 10:50.737
He's just starting to walk,
so maybe it's heavier than...

10:52.670 --> 10:54.737
You're okay, Denisovich.

10:54.837 --> 10:57.470
His name is Dennis.
Named after my father.

10:57.570 --> 11:02.237
It's not his vampire name.
My little Denisovichy-Weesovichy.

11:02.837 --> 11:04.903
Are we sure he's a vampire?

11:05.003 --> 11:08.037
I mean, not that it's a bad thing,
but shouldn't he have fangs

11:08.137 --> 11:10.837
and that pasty skin you guys have?

11:10.937 --> 11:14.203
Technically, you have until you're five
to get your vampire fangs.

11:14.303 --> 11:16.637
Oh, he'll get his fangs. He's a Dracula.

11:16.737 --> 11:18.670
He's also half Loughran.

11:18.770 --> 11:21.937
Maybe he'd be better off where we live.
There's more humans there.

11:22.037 --> 11:26.270
What? Look how well he's playing
with the wolf pups.

11:28.937 --> 11:33.203
We have a present.
I hope it's acceptable.

11:33.303 --> 11:38.003
"My First Guillotine." Very educational.
Well played, Frank.

11:38.103 --> 11:42.103
It's great. Thank you.
We just have to baby-proof that.

11:43.670 --> 11:47.170
Johnny, do you know
where you put the rubber guards?

11:47.270 --> 11:49.170
Baby-proofing a guillotine?

11:49.270 --> 11:52.670
So you cut your finger off.
It's part of the fun.

11:52.770 --> 11:55.070
She made me baby-proof the whole hotel.

11:55.170 --> 11:58.037
Someone's overprotective.

12:23.037 --> 12:24.803
Johnny! Come quick!

12:27.370 --> 12:28.837
What's up? He's okay?

12:29.203 --> 12:32.337
- Dennis said his first word!
- He did?

12:32.603 --> 12:35.337
Come on, honey. Say it again.

12:37.070 --> 12:40.003
I don't say, "Bleh, bleh-bleh."

12:40.503 --> 12:44.737
- We didn't say you did.
- Then where did he get that?

12:44.837 --> 12:47.070
Well, maybe sometimes you say it.

12:47.170 --> 12:49.570
I only say it when I say I don't say it!

12:51.270 --> 12:54.470
Okay, kid. We get it. You can talk.

12:55.003 --> 12:57.870
Denisovich.

12:58.403 --> 13:01.470
- Dad.
- Just checking for cavities.

13:07.537 --> 13:09.637
It was you!

13:19.603 --> 13:20.937
Oh, my goodness, Leonard.

13:21.037 --> 13:24.703
If you really looked that hideous,
I don't think I could hang out with you.

13:24.803 --> 13:28.970
Guys, what's the deal?
Is this a party? Pick up a phone.

13:29.070 --> 13:32.037
I don't care if Johnny said
it's a "cool app."

13:32.137 --> 13:34.237
Johnny's still new here.

13:34.337 --> 13:37.803
Now, Porridge Head, did you call
a hearse for the Gremlinbergs?

13:37.903 --> 13:41.103
No, you're checking
your Facebook page. Again.

13:41.203 --> 13:44.870
Drac, I told the guys social media
is the best way to promote the hotel.

13:44.970 --> 13:47.103
Right, Clifton?

13:47.737 --> 13:50.203
So, Drac, I wanted to go
through some thoughts I had,

13:50.303 --> 13:53.270
as your new human relations
coordinating co-assistant.

13:53.370 --> 13:57.637
Sure. It's a real job. Not a cheap excuse to
keep Mavis happy, so you never leave here.

13:57.737 --> 14:00.170
Right. So, I was thinking,

14:00.270 --> 14:04.403
since we have so many humans now,
maybe update some of the acts?

14:04.503 --> 14:07.737
- Like, maybe the magician?
- What's wrong with Harry Three-Eye?

14:07.837 --> 14:11.037
Well, he might be a little
old-school for the humans.

14:11.137 --> 14:15.137
- Tell me, sir, what was your card?
- The three of spades?

14:16.770 --> 14:20.203
Is this your card, my friend?

14:23.070 --> 14:26.837
No, Harry's great. Can't blame Harry
for the crowd not being hip.

14:26.937 --> 14:28.803
Okay, what about Wayne?

14:28.903 --> 14:32.537
- Wayne? Are you nuts? He's my boy.
- Then maybe something other than tennis?

14:32.637 --> 14:36.603
Okay, so, what you wanna do
is lift the racket right on impact,

14:36.703 --> 14:40.503
so you get that nice top spin.
Try and hit one.

14:49.103 --> 14:51.703
What is that?
What's the noise? It's on me!

14:51.803 --> 14:53.470
It's just the cell phone I got you.

14:53.570 --> 14:56.937
Clifton's sending you a text so you
can practice how to write back.

15:00.803 --> 15:03.637
- What the... it's not doing it.
- I got it.

15:04.570 --> 15:06.570
Dear Drac...

15:08.603 --> 15:10.703
Now you can text Clifton.

15:10.803 --> 15:12.437
All right, fine.

15:13.403 --> 15:16.037
- How do you do this?
- Maybe it's your fingernails.

15:16.137 --> 15:18.370
It's easy. Look. I'll text Mavis.

15:18.470 --> 15:21.003
Psyched for date night.

15:21.103 --> 15:23.670
See? And now look,
she texted right back.

15:23.770 --> 15:27.603
"Gotta cancel.
Can't leave Dennis." Okay.

15:27.703 --> 15:32.637
Are we never allowed to be alone again?

15:32.737 --> 15:36.703
I need to feel loved, too.

15:36.803 --> 15:39.003
And send.

15:39.103 --> 15:42.437
Okay. All that taught me
is that you're pathetic.

15:42.537 --> 15:44.937
Yeah, got it. Maybe you
should just get Bluetooth.

15:45.037 --> 15:47.737
Okay. Blue Tooth, come over here.

15:50.403 --> 15:51.937
So, now what?

15:56.203 --> 16:00.137
- Rise and shine, my Denisovich.
- Hi, Papa.

16:00.237 --> 16:04.537
Hello, my little devil.
Did you have sweet nightmares?

16:04.637 --> 16:07.403
I dreamed that I saw a stegosaurus.

16:08.037 --> 16:10.003
And were you drinking his blood?

16:10.403 --> 16:13.037
- No.
- Just throwing it out there.

16:13.137 --> 16:16.903
- Hey! You want to do something cool?
- Yeah!

16:17.003 --> 16:21.703
I'm going to teach you
how to turn into a bat. Like me.

16:21.803 --> 16:23.603
- See?
- Cool.

16:23.703 --> 16:28.103
Yes! Cool, like I said. Now you try.

16:28.203 --> 16:33.470
I'm a bat. I'm a bat. I'm a bat.
I'm a bat. I'm a bat.

16:33.737 --> 16:37.637
- I mean, a real bat.
- I'm a bat!

16:38.570 --> 16:43.237
Denisovich. Take a breath.
You can really turn into a bat.

16:43.337 --> 16:46.503
Try. Feel the bat.

16:47.937 --> 16:50.403
Not a chicken.

16:51.703 --> 16:53.603
What's that? The electric boogaloo?

16:53.703 --> 16:57.703
If I show you I can bust a move,
will you try to fly, then?

17:12.737 --> 17:15.803
Dad? Why are you guys dancing?

17:15.903 --> 17:19.203
- He was sleep-dancing.
- Come on, sweetie. Back to bed.

17:19.303 --> 17:22.002
"Back to bed"?
It's already after 8:00 p.m.

17:22.103 --> 17:25.903
Don't you remember the new sleep schedule?
He's going to human classes half the day.

17:26.703 --> 17:30.070
If he could just sleep till 2:00 a.m.
tonight, it'd be so great for him.

17:30.170 --> 17:34.070
But, honeydeath, six of Wayne's wolf pups
are having a birthday party tonight.

17:34.170 --> 17:37.770
- You wouldn't want him to miss that.
- Dad, I love the wolf pups,

17:37.870 --> 17:41.037
- but they're a little too rough for Dennis.
- "Too rough"?

17:41.137 --> 17:44.103
Haven't you noticed?
Dennis is different.

17:44.203 --> 17:47.337
What are you saying? Denisovich
shouldn't be around monsters?

17:47.437 --> 17:50.437
I love monsters! Video! Video!

17:50.537 --> 17:52.903
Oh, you wanna show Papa Drac
your monster video?

17:53.003 --> 17:54.803
Yeah!

17:56.470 --> 17:58.970
<i>Who's the coolest monster?</i>

17:59.070 --> 18:00.603
Kakie!

18:00.703 --> 18:03.737
<i>Wee! Kakie one happy monster!</i>

18:03.837 --> 18:06.437
<i>Kakie love cake! Yummy!</i>

18:06.537 --> 18:08.737
<i>Tummy get a tummyache.</i>

18:09.837 --> 18:12.103
How is that a monster?

18:12.203 --> 18:14.270
<i>Have some cake, Wuzzlelumplebum.</i>

18:14.370 --> 18:18.170
<i>Remember, kids,
a real monster always shares.</i>

18:18.270 --> 18:23.003
"Shares"? Yes! When I think monsters,
I think "shares."

18:23.103 --> 18:26.437
Now, let me tell you
what a real monster is, Denisovich.

18:26.537 --> 18:31.470
Dad, please. He's practically
five already. Don't force it.

18:34.337 --> 18:37.303
<i>Slow down, Wuzzlelumplebum.</i>

18:41.837 --> 18:45.203
<i>Twinkle, twinkle, little star
How I wonder...</i>

18:45.303 --> 18:47.903
Mommy, I'm too old for lullabies.

18:48.003 --> 18:49.970
What? That's not how that one goes.

18:50.070 --> 18:54.470
- This is the way most people sing it.
- "Most people"? What's wrong with...

18:54.570 --> 18:57.670
<i>Suffer, suffer, scream in pain</i>

18:57.770 --> 19:00.803
<i>Blood is spilling from your brain</i>

19:00.903 --> 19:03.937
- Daddy.
- Come on. You know how I sang it to you.

19:04.037 --> 19:07.337
<i>Zombies gnaw you like a plum</i>

19:07.437 --> 19:11.637
<i>Piercing cries and you succumb</i>

19:11.737 --> 19:15.937
<i>Suffer, suffer, scream in pain</i>

19:16.037 --> 19:22.237
<i>You will never breathe again</i>

19:23.270 --> 19:25.670
Still works.

19:47.637 --> 19:52.670
Happy birthday, Wally, Wilson,
Whoopi, Waylon, Weepy and Wanye.

19:53.203 --> 19:56.603
Denisovich! My big boy! You made it!

19:57.170 --> 20:01.870
I thought about what you said, Dad.
Maybe I was being a little overprotective.

20:01.970 --> 20:04.203
Thank you, coffin cake.

20:04.303 --> 20:07.170
- Dennis! I love you! Zing!
- Hi, Winnie.

20:07.270 --> 20:11.570
I just love your yummy
strawberry locks! Zing, zing!

20:13.570 --> 20:17.603
Winnie. Give him his space, hon.
I'm sorry, Mavis.

20:17.703 --> 20:20.237
It's okay, Aunt Wanda.
They're just playing.

20:20.337 --> 20:24.137
Holy rabies! Limbo?
I used to love that game!

20:24.237 --> 20:27.703
- Get in there, Mavey.
- Really? But I'm a parent now.

20:27.803 --> 20:30.903
- Show 'em how it's done.
- Okay. Okay, okay.

20:39.570 --> 20:42.303
No way! A pinata?

20:44.737 --> 20:46.803
Oh, Mavis, honey. That's for later.

20:48.570 --> 20:50.770
We don't want the pups
to have too much...

20:51.637 --> 20:53.270
Candy!

20:56.137 --> 20:57.903
...sugar.

21:04.570 --> 21:06.470
I'm sorry. Did I start all that?

21:06.570 --> 21:08.803
Don't worry. There's a reason
they call it a litter.

21:20.737 --> 21:22.970
Dennis! Are you okay?

21:23.070 --> 21:26.503
- I got a candy.
- Look! Your tooth came out.

21:26.603 --> 21:29.237
Are you kidding me?
He got his tooth knocked out?

21:29.337 --> 21:32.037
Oh, yes, indeed. Here comes the fang.

21:32.137 --> 21:35.503
Dad. His baby tooth wasn't a fang.
Why would this one be?

21:35.603 --> 21:37.937
He's not a monster.

21:41.903 --> 21:44.703
The sun's gonna come out soon,
and we gotta get to his classes.

21:44.803 --> 21:48.903
What's wrong with the classes
we have here? Like the kids' yoga?

21:49.003 --> 21:51.537
Yoga!

21:53.303 --> 21:55.237
This is Denisovich's home.

21:55.337 --> 21:58.070
- I don't know, Dad.
- What don't you know?

21:58.270 --> 22:01.603
Well, we've been talking about moving.

22:01.703 --> 22:04.137
Somewhere safer for Dennis.

22:04.237 --> 22:07.003
Maybe where Johnny
grew up in California.

22:07.103 --> 22:11.503
I'm sorry, but you can't just make
somebody something they're not.

22:13.303 --> 22:16.370
- Come on, honey. We have to go.
- Zing, zing?

22:17.070 --> 22:21.103
Mavey, wait. You can't mean that.

22:23.537 --> 22:25.303
You're in on this? The leaving?

22:26.070 --> 22:29.370
It's not definite at all. It's just something
she's definitely talking about,

22:29.470 --> 22:32.170
but until we do it,
it's not definitized.

22:35.270 --> 22:37.437
Did he just cover me with birdseed?

22:38.037 --> 22:40.237
Yeah, he covered me.

22:49.770 --> 22:52.237
Dad, it's not a fang.

22:52.337 --> 22:57.137
Dad, I don't know if it's the right place
for Dennis. Right, Johnny?

22:57.237 --> 23:00.737
Oh, hey, dudeman.
It's not me. It's Mavey.

23:00.837 --> 23:03.770
Hey, dudeman.
I'm afraid to say anything.

23:03.870 --> 23:06.803
Hey, dudeman. I'm a dudeman!

23:06.903 --> 23:08.770
Drac? Who you talkin' to?

23:08.870 --> 23:11.570
Do not disturb.
The count's wiggin' out in here.

23:12.670 --> 23:14.437
What are you wiggin' out about, Drac?

23:14.537 --> 23:17.503
The kids. Mavey Wavey's saying
she wants to leave.

23:17.603 --> 23:20.503
She wants to leave? What about Johnny?
He doesn't wanna go.

23:20.603 --> 23:22.903
He's making the hotel
more human-y for Dennis.

23:23.003 --> 23:24.937
You know, seeing
that he isn't a monster.

23:25.037 --> 23:27.970
He is a monster!
He's just a late fanger.

23:28.603 --> 23:30.837
- And I could be a hand model.
- Shut up!

23:30.937 --> 23:35.703
It's all that human-y stuff
that's confusing poor Denisovich.

23:35.803 --> 23:39.403
So maybe you gotta get the kid
around more monster-y things.

23:39.503 --> 23:41.003
Oh, I need a cape.

23:41.103 --> 23:44.503
I can't. She's always around,
checking up on me.

23:44.603 --> 23:47.803
Man, if you... if you could
just get some alone time.

23:47.903 --> 23:51.370
Wait a minute.
That's what Johnny wants, too.

23:51.470 --> 23:54.374
Alone time with Mavis.

23:56.137 --> 24:00.170
Have they even had a vacation
since before they were married?

24:02.870 --> 24:07.170
They're going to now. And so are we.
Frank, you're a genius.

24:23.170 --> 24:26.303
We'll take Denisovich
to all our old haunts.

24:26.403 --> 24:29.370
<i>Each of us will show him our skills.</i>

24:31.203 --> 24:34.003
<i>Teach him how to be a monster.</i>

24:35.770 --> 24:38.270
And he'll be fanging it up in no time.

24:38.370 --> 24:40.070
Boy turns five next week.

24:40.170 --> 24:43.003
If he's not a vampire by his birthday,
it ain't happenin'.

24:43.103 --> 24:45.270
Oh, it ain't ain't happening, baby.

24:45.370 --> 24:49.203
- All he needs is time with his vampa.
- "Vampa"?

24:49.303 --> 24:53.237
Vampire grandpa.
Come on, man. That's obvious.

24:55.037 --> 24:57.837
Johnny. Come outside.

24:57.937 --> 24:59.503
What? Who is it?

24:59.603 --> 25:02.537
It's your father-in-law.
I need to talk to you.

25:03.870 --> 25:05.870
What's up?

25:06.970 --> 25:08.870
Let me get rid of them. Sorry.

25:08.970 --> 25:12.403
No problem-o.
I was kinda diggin' the attention.

25:14.103 --> 25:17.170
Can they stay? I don't think
they're ready to leave yet.

25:17.270 --> 25:21.137
Come on. Go to your mother.
Look, you want to stay here, right?

25:21.237 --> 25:24.737
Of course. This is the first place
where I can really be myself.

25:24.837 --> 25:28.437
I haven't felt this alive since
they invented stuffed-crust pizza.

25:28.537 --> 25:33.003
Well, then, we've got some work to do.
Okay, so here's the plan.

25:33.103 --> 25:37.703
Maybe it's a good idea to take her
to your hometown. But remember...

25:37.803 --> 25:40.737
So, it's sliced avocado,
rolled oats with apricot,

25:40.837 --> 25:42.903
the Aveeno moisturizer after every bath.

25:43.003 --> 25:46.370
And then the Shea butter
on his tush before his PJs

25:46.470 --> 25:48.737
and then 20 minutes with the nebulizer

25:48.837 --> 25:52.303
while I read his Learning Factory
Phonics book to him.

25:52.403 --> 25:55.570
It's asking a lot, Dad.
We could just take Dennis with us.

25:55.670 --> 25:58.903
What? Are you kidding me?
And get him off his routine?

25:59.003 --> 26:03.337
No, no, no. You kids go to California,
and see if it's the right place

26:03.437 --> 26:06.237
- to raise Denisovich.
- And you remember how to video chat?

26:06.337 --> 26:09.603
Yes, yes. With the phone
and the buttons and the agony.

26:09.703 --> 26:13.537
Thanks for being so understanding, Dad.
I know you'll keep him safe.

26:13.637 --> 26:17.337
Of course, Mavey.
Stake my heart and hope to die.

26:17.437 --> 26:20.303
I'm just gonna miss him so much.

26:20.603 --> 26:24.037
- I love you, Dennis.
- I love you, Mommy.

26:24.137 --> 26:27.470
I'll tell him Mavey Wavey stories
every night before bed.

26:27.570 --> 26:30.203
You're the best. I love you, Dad.

26:32.970 --> 26:36.003
Gonna miss all you guys.
You're all my family.

26:36.103 --> 26:40.603
- Love you, Drac.
- Yes. I love you, too.

26:40.703 --> 26:44.270
Now, remember the plan.
Just keep her distracted and happy.

26:44.370 --> 26:46.970
- But not too happy, capisce?
- Got it.

26:47.070 --> 26:49.470
Operation "Just Keep Her
Distracted and Happy,

26:49.570 --> 26:52.937
"But Not Too Happy, Capisce,"
starts now. Cool?

26:53.037 --> 26:55.837
- Smiling on the outside.
- Will you hug my backpack?

26:55.937 --> 26:56.937
No.

27:03.403 --> 27:05.437
Back to bed.

27:05.537 --> 27:08.303
Yes, we'll get to the bed.
We all love the bed.

27:08.403 --> 27:12.037
But we're just gonna do one thing first.

27:14.503 --> 27:16.170
Is it shorts weather where we're going?

27:16.270 --> 27:19.203
Jeez. I hope not.
My body isn't swimsuit-ready yet.

27:19.303 --> 27:21.337
Whatever. Where's Griffin?

27:21.437 --> 27:23.870
Hey, can I have a second?
I'm just saying goodbye to Emily.

27:23.970 --> 27:25.370
Oh, brother.

27:25.470 --> 27:27.903
I'm gonna miss you so much.

27:28.003 --> 27:32.170
You know, you have to be strong, honey.
Because what we have is unbreakable.

27:33.737 --> 27:36.437
Babe, don't cry. Everyone's looking.

27:36.537 --> 27:38.137
Okay, I gotta call him on this.

27:38.237 --> 27:40.670
Just let him play it out,
get it over with.

27:40.770 --> 27:45.570
Okay, you two lovebirds. Drink
your champagne and let's get going.

27:45.770 --> 27:50.003
Oh, yeah. No, sure. Okay. Cheers, babe.

27:51.337 --> 27:53.403
Oh. You klutz.

27:53.703 --> 27:57.503
- We can't say nothin' about this?
- No. We don't have time for zingers.

28:05.470 --> 28:09.103
How do you click in the stupid car seat?

28:09.203 --> 28:10.537
You gotta cut those nails, man.

28:10.637 --> 28:12.970
We just strap our kids down
with duct tape.

28:17.603 --> 28:18.670
What's he doing here?

28:18.770 --> 28:22.037
I told him he could come.
He's never been outside the hotel.

28:22.137 --> 28:25.337
Blobby, there's no room. Sorry, man.

28:27.403 --> 28:28.870
Yeah, that ain't happenin'.

28:28.970 --> 28:32.170
Fine, put him on the Rascal.
Let's just get going.

28:46.637 --> 28:48.903
Where are we going, Papa Drac?

28:49.003 --> 28:53.603
Oh, Denisovich, we're going to have
an adventure. A monster-y adventure.

28:53.703 --> 28:56.837
Yay! Monsters! We're gonna eat cake.

28:56.937 --> 29:00.837
- What did he say?
- No. No cake on this monster trip.

29:00.937 --> 29:05.270
No cake, cebause Kakie says,
"Too much cake makes tummy ache."

29:05.370 --> 29:09.337
Yay! "A monster always shares."

29:11.003 --> 29:13.303
We may need more than a week.

29:13.403 --> 29:16.470
Hey, you know who could fix
the kid in a snap? Vlad.

29:16.570 --> 29:19.703
What? We don't need to call Vlad.
We got this.

29:20.203 --> 29:24.603
You see, Denisovich,
monsters are nice, just like you.

29:24.703 --> 29:29.637
But when the moon comes out,
the real monster fun begins.

29:29.737 --> 29:33.837
Being scary. Right, guys?

29:36.103 --> 29:39.303
Guys? Guys! What is wrong with you?

29:39.503 --> 29:41.503
Come on. Everybody likes that song.

29:41.603 --> 29:45.470
We're not everybody.
We're scary monsters. Remember?

29:45.570 --> 29:48.403
- Hey, what are you putting in?
- It's an audio book.

29:48.503 --> 29:51.870
Bigfoot's life story.
He reads it himself.

29:51.970 --> 29:54.003
<i>Chapter One.</i>

30:27.137 --> 30:28.837
This is gonna be so amazing.

30:28.937 --> 30:33.537
Oh, yeah. You're gonna be so happy,
but not too happy. What?

30:33.637 --> 30:35.770
I wanna see everything
you did growing up.

30:35.870 --> 30:38.703
As long as you're distracted, capisce?

30:39.837 --> 30:41.770
We can hit a few spots
on the way to my parents.

30:41.870 --> 30:44.870
- Lemme just quickly call home.
- Don't do that.

30:44.970 --> 30:47.837
It's only 1:00 a.m. there.
Dennis isn't even up yet.

30:47.937 --> 30:50.770
Right. I'm just not used
to being away from him.

30:50.870 --> 30:53.870
Everything's gonna be cool.
Your dad was so all over it.

30:53.970 --> 30:56.203
I know. He's the best.

31:16.403 --> 31:18.670
Right turn, here.

31:18.903 --> 31:22.070
Denisovich, rise and shine.

31:22.170 --> 31:24.703
Boys, this bringing back any memories?

31:24.803 --> 31:28.070
We used to prowl around here
when we were in our 100s.

31:28.170 --> 31:31.937
The Dark Forest of Slobozia.

31:41.403 --> 31:44.437
- Nice how they built it up.
- Okay, out of the car.

31:44.937 --> 31:49.803
Denisovich... you're going to see
every monster do his specialty.

31:49.903 --> 31:53.803
First, Frank's gonna show us
how he scares people.

31:53.903 --> 31:56.437
Yay! He's gonna say, "Boo."

31:56.537 --> 31:58.970
Yeah, I don't think "boos" ever work.

31:59.070 --> 32:03.070
But that's why we're here.
To learn from the master.

32:03.537 --> 32:05.803
Okay, I'll give it a shot.

32:21.037 --> 32:23.337
Yeah, guess it just depends on work.

32:25.037 --> 32:28.170
- Frankenstein!
- Hey, how ya doin'?

32:28.570 --> 32:31.537
You're awesome!
Can we take a picture? Is that okay?

32:31.637 --> 32:34.570
Sure, okay. Little selfie action.

32:35.403 --> 32:36.403
For real?

32:36.837 --> 32:40.037
- Awesome! Thank you so much.
- Hey, have a great day.

32:40.537 --> 32:44.137
- Boo!
- He's adorable.

32:44.237 --> 32:49.803
Adorable, yes.
Not scary, but "boo" is a start.

32:59.803 --> 33:02.837
My birthday cake's gonna have
the coolest guy on it.

33:02.937 --> 33:05.037
Let me guess. Kakie.

33:05.137 --> 33:08.937
No. He's so cool.
He climbs walls and wears a cape.

33:09.037 --> 33:12.170
Oh, really.
And who is this very cool guy?

33:12.270 --> 33:15.503
- Batman!
- Batman. Great.

33:15.603 --> 33:20.403
You don't know anyone else with a cape
that's cool? This is good. Stop here.

33:25.937 --> 33:29.270
Okay, Wayne. It's your turn.
Go kill something.

33:29.370 --> 33:31.770
- Denisovich, watch this.
- What?

33:31.870 --> 33:33.137
I told you, come on.

33:33.237 --> 33:37.370
If we don't inspire Denisovich,
how's he going to find his inner monster?

33:37.470 --> 33:40.137
- Who's in a monster?
- Nobody, just...

33:40.237 --> 33:42.537
- Here, have an avocado.
- Yay!

33:42.637 --> 33:46.670
Your mommy says it's a good fat.
Whatever the heaven that means.

33:46.770 --> 33:51.137
Listen, I'm not gonna set monsters back again
just to make your grandkid like vampires.

33:51.237 --> 33:54.237
Anyway, there's nothing to kill here.
It's all been...

33:58.337 --> 34:01.470
What a cutie. But kill him.

34:01.570 --> 34:05.137
Oh, great. You know
I haven't done this in years.

34:05.237 --> 34:08.103
We don't need to kill anymore.
We have Pop-Tarts.

34:08.203 --> 34:10.237
Denisovich, you're going to love this.

34:10.337 --> 34:15.170
Wayne's going to eat that whole deer,
and the next one's yours. Wayne, go.

34:19.536 --> 34:24.503
Oh, man. I'm too old for this.
Okay, how's it go again?

34:25.670 --> 34:29.737
No, no, wait. That's for the moon.
Oh, I growl. Right, here goes.

34:31.870 --> 34:34.603
- Growl!
- Get it, boy.

34:39.637 --> 34:41.337
Get it, Uncle Wayne.

34:43.203 --> 34:47.370
Some werewolf.
Did you actually say the word "growl?"

34:47.469 --> 34:50.603
- You're a werewussy.
- I said I was rusty.

34:52.203 --> 34:54.703
- Gimme me that Frisbee.
- No! It's my Frisbee! I fetched it!

34:54.803 --> 34:56.370
Give it to me! Give it back!

34:56.469 --> 34:59.770
Give it over here!
Give me that! Give it back!

35:05.003 --> 35:07.937
He's fine. He's Blobby.

35:09.170 --> 35:12.037
This place is so amazing and scenic.

35:12.137 --> 35:14.070
What do you wanna show me first?

35:14.170 --> 35:17.903
I don't know. It's pretty, but there's really
nothing to do once it gets dark.

35:18.003 --> 35:19.770
Wait. What's that place?

35:23.637 --> 35:28.003
So, you're telling me that I can pick
between all these different kinds of chips?

35:28.703 --> 35:32.437
- Yes.
- How do people decide?

35:33.337 --> 35:36.670
Now what's that
beautiful fountain of rubies?

35:37.437 --> 35:41.437
- Johnny, have you tried this Slurpee?
- Not that quickly, hon.

35:41.537 --> 35:45.837
It comes in 48 flavors.
We have to try them all.

35:48.337 --> 35:49.737
I don't know if we have time.

35:49.837 --> 35:52.903
Why? This place is open
all night. Right, sir?

35:53.703 --> 35:55.170
Yes.

35:58.737 --> 35:59.537
Johnny, look.

35:59.637 --> 36:03.037
<i>They're making a TV show
about this place and we're the stars.</i>

36:03.137 --> 36:05.770
- <i>Hello, world.</i>
- <i>Awesome.</i>

36:05.870 --> 36:09.803
<i>It's totally awesome.
You're so lucky, Kal.</i>

36:10.437 --> 36:12.603
<i>Hello, world.</i>

36:15.603 --> 36:18.437
Okay, Murray. Your turn.

36:19.003 --> 36:22.103
Excuse us. Do you know where
someone can get a bite around here?

36:22.203 --> 36:25.070
Did you seriously just ask
a vampire where to get a bite?

36:25.503 --> 36:27.837
Oh, gosh. I didn't mean...
We're not from around here.

36:27.937 --> 36:30.537
This is so embarrassing.
Just keep going.

36:30.637 --> 36:33.103
Sorry to bother you.
Love your chocolate cereal.

36:36.103 --> 36:39.737
- So, what do you want me to do now?
- Denisovich, you won't believe it.

36:39.837 --> 36:44.270
The mummy can crash through walls
and turn into a swarm of beetles

36:44.370 --> 36:46.503
and put a curse on anyone.

36:46.603 --> 36:49.270
- That sounds mean.
- It's fun mean.

36:49.370 --> 36:50.870
Okay. So, check it out.

36:50.970 --> 36:56.070
Murray's going to conjure up
the biggest sandstorm you've ever seen.

36:56.170 --> 36:59.203
- Hit it!
- Sandstorm? It's been awhile.

36:59.303 --> 37:01.903
Not my problem. Do it.
Say your little spell.

37:02.003 --> 37:04.503
Okay.

37:04.603 --> 37:09.437
I got this. Frank, Wayne,
Griffin, just try not to faint.

37:30.337 --> 37:32.070
My back.

37:40.870 --> 37:43.037
Oh. Wait.

37:48.203 --> 37:50.303
How cute!

37:56.470 --> 38:00.270
Wait. Stop at that playground.
Look at these cute kids.

38:06.537 --> 38:09.737
Holy rabies! This looks like a blast.

38:09.837 --> 38:13.870
I don't know, Mavey. This can be pretty
dangerous if you don't know what you're doing.

38:13.970 --> 38:17.503
Of course, I rock these bikes.
May I, little dude?

38:17.903 --> 38:20.503
Check it out. Oh, yeah.

38:20.603 --> 38:23.403
This is how I rolled every summer.

38:37.237 --> 38:38.603
I think I scratched it.

38:39.870 --> 38:40.837
My turn.

38:40.937 --> 38:44.470
Mavey, I told you,
it took me years to get this good.

38:44.570 --> 38:47.570
Well, I'll give it a try.

39:25.370 --> 39:28.270
You feel me now?
That's my girlfriend, suckers.

39:28.370 --> 39:31.103
- Your wife, Johnny.
- My wife. Even better.

39:31.203 --> 39:35.103
That was sick, lady.
Where did you learn how to do that stuff?

39:35.203 --> 39:36.237
Transylvania.

39:36.337 --> 39:39.670
That's cool.
I have a cousin from Pennsylvania.

39:39.770 --> 39:43.337
Oh. These little guys are so sweet.
Dennis would love them.

39:43.437 --> 39:47.237
- What an awesome place to raise a kid.
- To raise a kid?

39:47.337 --> 39:52.237
I don't know about awesome.
Maybe tubular. Capisce?

39:52.337 --> 39:55.270
Anyways, we should hit my folks' place.
I said we'd be there by now.

39:55.370 --> 40:00.937
Sure. Hey, it's after 3:00 in Transylvania.
I'm gonna check on Dennis, okay?

40:05.403 --> 40:08.170
Chocolate cereal. Are you kidding me?

40:08.270 --> 40:10.470
It's okay, Drac.
It's 'cause they love us.

40:10.570 --> 40:12.970
Yeah. Monsters are what's goin' on.

40:13.070 --> 40:17.070
Yeah. You should embrace it like I did.
I've got a best-selling workout video.

40:17.170 --> 40:19.770
Follow me, ladies. Right. And left.

40:19.870 --> 40:22.637
No, girls. Watch me.
You're not watching.

40:22.737 --> 40:25.837
Here we go. And eight
and seven and six...

40:25.937 --> 40:27.103
That's not me, guys.

40:27.203 --> 40:30.570
Come on, even Bigfoot's tearin' it up
in the German soccer league.

40:39.570 --> 40:42.503
Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no. It's Mavis.

40:42.603 --> 40:44.603
You gotta answer it.

40:44.703 --> 40:48.303
- You're pushin' too hard. Lighter.
- All right!

40:48.403 --> 40:51.570
Denisovich, wake up.
Oh, boy, he's out cold.

40:51.670 --> 40:53.703
I got this.

40:55.503 --> 40:57.937
- Dad, what took so long?
- <i>What?</i>

40:58.037 --> 41:03.470
Nothing, Mavey. We're all great here
at the hotel. Just doing hotel things.

41:03.570 --> 41:06.432
- Sorry, can't handle your breath.
- I hear ya.

41:06.532 --> 41:07.870
How are you?

41:07.970 --> 41:13.437
<i>We're having a blast. We just went biking
and mini-marting. It's so fun here.</i>

41:13.537 --> 41:16.203
- <i>Is Dennis okay?</i>
- Oh. Of course.

41:16.737 --> 41:19.803
- <i>You want to see him?</i>
- Yes. Yes, I do.

41:19.903 --> 41:22.603
- Hi, baby. How are you?
- <i>Mommy.</i>

41:22.903 --> 41:25.103
I happy.

41:25.670 --> 41:28.770
- <i>Hey, little dude.</i>
- Why is he wearing sunglasses?

41:28.870 --> 41:33.737
<i>Oh, we were playing.
It's a superhero thing.</i>

41:33.837 --> 41:37.070
Cebause, I'm Sunglasses Man,
to the rescue!

41:37.170 --> 41:39.070
- Okay, take it down a notch.
- I'm flying.

41:39.170 --> 41:40.403
You sound funny.

41:40.503 --> 41:44.370
Oh, no, no, that's his
Sunglasses Man voice.

41:44.470 --> 41:46.870
Static. The signal is bad.

41:46.970 --> 41:50.370
- Mavis, are you there?
- Yeah, I'm still...

41:51.037 --> 41:53.837
All right. I guess he's having fun.

41:53.937 --> 41:56.303
Of course he is.

41:57.437 --> 42:00.037
I nailed it with the Sunglasses Man.

42:00.137 --> 42:03.503
Right off the top of my head. I threw in
a "cebause." Did everyone see that?

42:03.603 --> 42:06.337
She said she was having fun.
Johnny's blowing it.

42:06.437 --> 42:09.603
She's biking and mini-marting.
She's gonna wanna move!

42:09.703 --> 42:12.903
I gotta fix this kid now.
Are we almost there or what?

42:13.003 --> 42:16.570
Okay, I may have taken
a wrong turn a few miles back.

42:16.670 --> 42:19.303
- Don't get mad.
- What?

42:20.270 --> 42:22.503
Someone turn on the navigator
on this thing.

42:22.603 --> 42:24.237
Look how light I touch it.

42:24.337 --> 42:27.570
<i>Please enter your destination.</i>

42:27.670 --> 42:31.737
<i>Please. I am begging you.</i>

42:34.037 --> 42:36.303
Yeah, this is gonna be good, Denisovich.

42:36.403 --> 42:39.237
Scary stuff, okay? It's in you.

42:39.337 --> 42:42.070
We just gotta concentrate on the scary.

42:42.170 --> 42:44.903
Papa Drac? Do you miss Grandma?

42:45.003 --> 42:47.937
Miss Grandma? Oh. Sure, I do.

42:48.037 --> 42:52.937
I miss her every day. She was my zing.

42:53.237 --> 42:56.203
- Why do you ask?
- I don't know.

42:56.303 --> 43:00.203
- Do you miss anybody?
- I miss Mommy and Daddy.

43:00.303 --> 43:02.970
And who else? You miss that Winnie?

43:03.070 --> 43:06.337
The pup who tackles you and tries
to lick you all the time?

43:06.437 --> 43:08.470
Yeah, but we're just friends.

43:08.570 --> 43:11.237
Oh, no, no, no. You're a Dracula.

43:11.337 --> 43:15.103
You can't just be friends with a cute,
hairy number like Winnie.

43:15.203 --> 43:20.870
Right turn, now! Here. You imbecile!

43:20.970 --> 43:23.703
- Oh, right. Turn, Griffin!
- Yes, Papa Drac.

43:28.270 --> 43:32.703
Wait and see, fellas. This kid'll
be guzzling goat blood in no time.

43:32.803 --> 43:37.203
<i>You have arrived
at your destination. Yes! Yes!</i>

43:37.303 --> 43:41.137
Here we are. It's the vampire
summer camp I went to as a kid.

43:41.237 --> 43:45.670
- What's it, Camp Vamp?
- No. Who names their camp "Camp Vamp?"

43:45.770 --> 43:48.903
It's Camp Winnepacaca.

44:08.603 --> 44:14.103
You see, Denisovich? This is where
I learned to catch mice and shapeshift.

44:14.203 --> 44:18.070
And use my incredible powers
and strength. It's pretty cool.

44:18.170 --> 44:19.403
Badminton.

44:23.503 --> 44:26.770
Yes, I don't remember this badminting.

44:26.870 --> 44:30.003
Well, well, is this a night?
How ya doin', folks?

44:30.103 --> 44:31.670
I'm Dana, the director.

44:31.770 --> 44:36.137
We're sure excited to have you legends
visitin' us. What can I do you for?

44:36.237 --> 44:42.003
Well, I'm very interested in sending
my grandboy, Denisovich, here.

44:42.103 --> 44:45.470
This little redheaded,
non-fangy little guy?

44:45.570 --> 44:49.137
Oh, they're in there. He's a late fanger.
That's why we came here.

44:49.237 --> 44:53.370
Can you show us some of the drills,
like where they catch the mice?

44:53.570 --> 44:57.503
Can do. A-course now
we call it Tee-Mousing.

45:07.670 --> 45:10.103
So they don't have to catch the mice?

45:10.203 --> 45:14.537
Nope. We find this is a good way
to build their confidence.

45:15.870 --> 45:17.403
Come here.

45:17.737 --> 45:20.003
It's right there!
What's the matter with you?

45:21.670 --> 45:23.203
Hokey-pokey.

45:25.803 --> 45:29.037
There it is, Denisovich.
Where Papa learned to fly.

45:29.670 --> 45:31.270
I wanna fly like Papa.

45:38.137 --> 45:40.970
Yeah. We're over here, now.

45:41.070 --> 45:44.537
Had to scale it down. Insurance.

45:47.503 --> 45:49.237
Help me. Help me. Help me.

45:49.737 --> 45:53.403
Hokey-pokey. See ya at the campfire.

45:57.670 --> 46:00.470
Well, gosh! Welcome, you two.

46:00.570 --> 46:04.837
- Hey, gang.
- Hi, guys. This is so exciting.

46:04.937 --> 46:09.303
Look at all of this. So cool.

46:09.403 --> 46:11.337
I can't believe I'm actually here.

46:11.437 --> 46:16.070
Well, you are. Now, how does it work?
Are you up all night and sleep all day?

46:16.170 --> 46:19.137
- Yeah.
- I'll do whatever you guys want.

46:19.237 --> 46:22.437
Good. 'Cause I bought
this pretty sunhat for you.

46:22.537 --> 46:24.637
But otherwise this poncho,
if you wanna be safe.

46:24.737 --> 46:28.070
- We can deal with it later, Linda.
- Okay.

46:28.503 --> 46:30.203
Come see.

46:30.337 --> 46:32.703
I've set up your bedroom.

46:36.203 --> 46:38.537
It's just like Transylvania.

46:38.637 --> 46:42.637
Oh, Transylvania.
That was a fun experience.

46:42.737 --> 46:44.770
Mike was afraid he'd get
disemboweled and eaten,

46:44.870 --> 46:48.503
- but I told him he was just being silly.
- That was you, Linda.

46:48.903 --> 46:53.570
There they are. You know, we have a couple
of mixed families in the neighborhood,

46:53.670 --> 46:55.537
so I thought I'd invite them over.

46:55.637 --> 46:59.870
They might be nice for you guys to talk to
since you're thinkin' about moving here.

47:01.203 --> 47:03.337
Hi, Caren. Hi, Pandragora.

47:03.437 --> 47:06.270
- Welcome, Mavis.
- Hey, guys.

47:06.403 --> 47:09.537
Yeah, you're gonna dig it here.
Don't even worry.

47:09.637 --> 47:12.903
People are totally cool
with our lifestyle choice.

47:13.003 --> 47:16.237
I mean, the kids get picked on a little,
but it toughens them up.

47:16.637 --> 47:19.803
Oh, hey, you guys. And this is
Loretta. She's married to Paul,

47:19.903 --> 47:21.970
- who's a werewolf.
- Excuse me?

47:22.070 --> 47:25.803
Yes, I was telling Mavis about the other
monster-human couples in town.

47:25.903 --> 47:30.037
- I am not a werewolf.
- Oh. I thought...

47:30.137 --> 47:34.003
Well, you're welcome to stay
and have some cupcakes.

47:36.503 --> 47:40.637
<i>Vampires will be friends forever</i>

47:40.737 --> 47:44.937
<i>Through the centuries together</i>

47:45.037 --> 47:49.203
<i>Even in the brightest sunny weather</i>

47:49.303 --> 47:53.703
<i>Vampires will be friends forever</i>

47:53.803 --> 47:57.003
<i>Literally</i>

47:57.103 --> 47:59.670
<i>Forever</i>

48:04.137 --> 48:08.103
Great job, vampires.
Give yourselves a hug.

48:13.203 --> 48:15.637
- We're going.
- What? Where?

48:21.703 --> 48:22.970
Why are we doing this?

48:23.070 --> 48:25.670
You'd rather be listening
to those putrid new songs?

48:25.770 --> 48:28.270
<i>What happened to Michael Row
Your Corpse Ashore?</i>

48:28.370 --> 48:31.037
<i>Or Old McWerewolf Had An Axe?</i>

48:36.037 --> 48:38.103
We shouldn't be up here, Drac.

48:38.203 --> 48:42.203
- Who's ready to fly?
- Me! Me! Like a superhero.

48:42.303 --> 48:44.537
Better! Like a vampire!

48:45.337 --> 48:49.070
This thing is rickety. You know what?
Maybe the kid isn't supposed to fly.

48:49.170 --> 48:53.703
Quiet. This is how they learn.
You throw them and they figure it out.

48:53.803 --> 48:56.370
- It's how I was taught.
- I wanna fly now!

48:56.470 --> 49:00.270
Attabat. You know Papa's
right here if you need him.

49:01.070 --> 49:03.037
- I can't watch this.
- Please don't.

49:03.137 --> 49:05.670
Here we go!

49:12.137 --> 49:15.103
- He's still not flying.
- He will.

49:16.037 --> 49:19.003
- Still not.
- It'll happen.

49:19.437 --> 49:22.403
- This is a tall tower.
- That's why it's good.

49:22.503 --> 49:24.870
- You should get him.
- He's gonna fall to his death.

49:24.970 --> 49:27.537
He's taking his time.

49:28.203 --> 49:31.637
- Drac!
- I did that my first time.

49:31.737 --> 49:34.537
He's getting too close to the ground!

49:34.637 --> 49:36.537
You know what? He's not gonna fly.

49:46.670 --> 49:50.037
I told you. Papa's always here for you.

49:50.137 --> 49:51.803
Again! Again!

49:51.903 --> 49:54.937
Oh, dear. Oh, my devil.
We're gonna have to report this.

49:55.037 --> 49:57.937
You mean to the papers?
I guess it was pretty cool,

49:58.037 --> 50:02.137
- but I'm not about getting press.
- No, sir. I mean the authorities.

50:02.237 --> 50:05.270
I can't not report child endangerment.

50:05.370 --> 50:07.670
Listen to me. That was fun.

50:07.770 --> 50:10.270
Your singing is child endangerment.

50:10.370 --> 50:11.870
Should we go down and help him?

50:11.970 --> 50:14.937
Nope. I told him this was nuts.
He's on his own.

50:15.037 --> 50:18.237
- We have to call the boy's mother.
- No, that ain't happening.

50:18.337 --> 50:20.970
His mother's already nutsy koo koo!

50:21.070 --> 50:23.270
I have to follow protocol.

50:23.570 --> 50:26.903
You will not follow protocol.

50:27.003 --> 50:30.237
I'm a vampire. I can't be hypnotized.

50:30.337 --> 50:31.870
- Right.
- Now, please.

50:31.970 --> 50:36.603
- Don't make me call the police.
- No one's calling nobody!

50:38.637 --> 50:40.170
Fire!

50:40.270 --> 50:43.137
Stop, drop and roll.
Stop, drop and roll.

50:43.237 --> 50:45.570
Screaming's not helping!

50:53.237 --> 50:55.703
Are we bad guys, Papa Drac?

50:55.803 --> 50:56.870
Bad?

50:58.103 --> 51:01.137
No. You're the best kid in the world.

51:01.237 --> 51:04.370
We didn't start the fire.
It was the tower.

51:04.470 --> 51:09.170
That's a very unsafe tower.
You're lucky we don't call the authorities.

51:09.270 --> 51:14.037
- Let's go, my hero.
- Cebause I'm Batman! To the Batmobile!

51:14.537 --> 51:16.703
Yes. To the...

51:26.503 --> 51:29.437
Sorry about all that stuff.
I guess they thought you'd like it.

51:29.537 --> 51:31.603
Why do I feel so weird here?

51:31.703 --> 51:33.803
No, hon. They're being weird.

51:33.903 --> 51:35.970
I think they're just trying to help me.

51:36.070 --> 51:39.803
I mean, I grew up knowing nothing
living inside that hotel.

51:39.903 --> 51:43.037
And you learned about everything
growing up in Santa Claus.

51:43.137 --> 51:45.170
Santa Cruz. But...

51:45.270 --> 51:48.170
Maybe if Dennis grows up
away from Transylvania,

51:48.270 --> 51:52.403
he won't be so freaky. Like me.

51:52.503 --> 51:55.737
Are you nuts? Mavis, you're a blast.

51:55.837 --> 51:58.737
You're so full of life
and curious about everything.

51:58.837 --> 52:03.637
If Dennis grows up to be just like you,
I'll be the luckiest dad in the world.

52:04.237 --> 52:06.470
I love you, Johnnystein.

52:06.570 --> 52:10.837
You know what? As long as we're all
together, we'll be happy anywhere.

52:10.937 --> 52:13.437
Even at the hotel.

52:13.570 --> 52:15.637
Yes!

52:17.437 --> 52:19.270
What are you doing?

52:19.370 --> 52:23.770
Check out this video my friend sent me.
This kid is an awesome daredevil.

52:25.870 --> 52:28.803
- <i>Oh, dude! Did you get it?</i>
- Wait! Is that Dennis?

52:28.903 --> 52:33.737
No! Is it? No.
It's just hard to see. But...

52:33.837 --> 52:36.770
Oops. Just deleted it. So, it's gone.

52:46.537 --> 52:50.170
What? It's Mavis. I'm not answering it.

52:51.137 --> 52:53.837
Come on, Drac. You have to.

52:55.837 --> 52:57.337
All right!

52:57.437 --> 52:59.037
Yes, honeybunch.

52:59.237 --> 53:01.203
<i>Dad? Where are you?</i>

53:01.303 --> 53:04.503
We're outside the hotel
having a little cookout.

53:04.703 --> 53:07.637
- It's perfectly safe.
- What's that noise? Is that a siren?

53:07.737 --> 53:11.270
Oh, those are just some wailing
banshees checking in.

53:11.370 --> 53:15.737
Quiet, you banshees. We're trying to have
a perfectly safe cookout over here.

53:15.837 --> 53:18.903
Mommy! I wanna say hi! Mommy! Mommy!

53:19.103 --> 53:22.503
- Papa Drac just tried to teach me how to fly.
- Wait a minute. Is that the mother?

53:22.603 --> 53:26.870
- <i>Oh, no. Static again.</i>
- I am coming back to the hotel right now.

53:26.970 --> 53:32.403
And you better be there or I swear, Dad,
you're gonna be very sorry.

53:32.503 --> 53:35.837
- What's goin' on?
- We need to get home right away.

53:37.837 --> 53:40.503
Okay. I'll go wake up my backpack.

53:40.603 --> 53:44.503
Guys, we gotta move. We got no car!
How we gonna get out of here?

53:44.603 --> 53:46.437
Don't worry. I made a call.

53:55.503 --> 53:59.203
I'm sorry, Blobby.
We really meant to call you sooner.

54:05.403 --> 54:07.503
Hit it!

54:21.670 --> 54:22.737
Transylvania.

54:22.837 --> 54:25.770
- You want to go where?
- Transylvania. As soon as possible.

54:25.870 --> 54:28.970
- We don't fly direct to Transylvania.
- You don't?

54:29.070 --> 54:33.037
You can go to Bucharest, but you'll have
to switch planes in Chicago and then Zurich.

54:33.137 --> 54:34.670
So, when would we get there?

54:34.770 --> 54:38.103
Well, the Chicago flight's delayed
due to bad weather.

54:43.637 --> 54:47.303
- So, two seats in coach?
- No!

54:47.403 --> 54:49.137
- No!
- Yes.

55:08.770 --> 55:11.703
You have to go now?
When we finally have no traffic.

55:11.803 --> 55:14.370
You're killing me, Blobby.

55:23.337 --> 55:26.403
I still have some cloud on me.
Gotta do a selfie!

55:26.503 --> 55:30.237
- Johnny! Not now!
- Okay. Maybe later.

55:35.037 --> 55:38.270
This scooter thing's out of juice.
We're never gonna make it.

55:38.370 --> 55:40.137
Frank, blow.

55:49.337 --> 55:51.303
Now!

56:12.737 --> 56:17.603
How fun is this? Why are you laughing?
You like that? Watch this.

56:29.370 --> 56:33.937
- Now this is flying, Denisovich.
- Like a vampire.

56:37.203 --> 56:40.103
That's my boy. Look at you go.

56:48.870 --> 56:53.137
You're the coolest guy
who wears a cape, Papa Drac.

57:20.837 --> 57:26.170
So, hey, when are you going to get here
already? We've been waiting...

57:27.437 --> 57:29.637
Give me my son.

57:29.737 --> 57:32.070
We just went out for some avocados.

57:32.170 --> 57:35.103
- Mommy! I flew!
- I saw.

57:35.203 --> 57:39.737
<i>Mother's already nutsy koo koo
Nutsy koo koo</i>

57:40.337 --> 57:43.337
<i>Oh, dear, oh, dear
Oh, my devil I have to follow protocol</i>

57:43.437 --> 57:45.337
<i>That ain't happening
That ain't happening</i>

57:45.437 --> 57:47.537
<i>Mother's already...</i>

57:57.670 --> 58:01.103
I was worried Dennis wasn't safe
around other monsters.

58:01.203 --> 58:04.070
Now I don't even feel
like he's safe around you.

58:04.470 --> 58:06.837
- But I was just...
- What was it you said?

58:06.937 --> 58:10.337
Human, monster, unicorn.
That it didn't matter?

58:10.437 --> 58:12.503
Well, I just know his life would...

58:12.603 --> 58:16.670
We'll have his birthday party here
on Wednesday. Then we're moving.

58:16.970 --> 58:19.970
Please, Mavey. Don't leave.

58:20.070 --> 58:22.970
Maybe you've let humans
into your hotel, Dad.

58:23.070 --> 58:25.703
But I don't think
you've let them into your heart.

59:10.037 --> 59:12.903
I can do it. I can do it.

59:13.303 --> 59:15.870
I'm a bat. I'm a bat.

59:16.470 --> 59:18.370
I'm a bat. I'm a bat. I'm a bat!

59:18.470 --> 59:22.403
- Dennis? What are you doing, sweetie?
- Nothing.

59:22.503 --> 59:25.503
Careful. Let me help you
down from there.

59:25.603 --> 59:27.870
Are you getting excited
about your big party?

59:28.303 --> 59:30.970
- I guess so.
- You know who's coming?

59:31.070 --> 59:34.737
Daddy's whole family.
Grandpa Mike and Grandma Linda.

59:34.837 --> 59:38.503
All your cousins and aunts and uncles
who love you so much.

59:38.603 --> 59:42.703
And then they're gonna be with us
when we move to California.

59:42.803 --> 59:47.337
Mommy, are we going away
cebause I'm not a monster?

59:47.437 --> 59:50.970
What? No. Dennis, of course not. It's...

59:51.070 --> 59:53.503
It's just grown-up stuff.

59:53.603 --> 59:56.303
Okay. But what about Papa Drac?

59:56.403 --> 59:58.703
He's gonna be here all alone.

59:58.803 --> 01:00:01.670
Papa Drac has to stay here
to run the hotel.

01:00:01.770 --> 01:00:04.670
But he'll visit us. And we'll visit him.

01:00:04.770 --> 01:00:08.537
- Can we call him every night?
- Sure.

01:00:13.637 --> 01:00:14.970
Awesome!

01:00:15.070 --> 01:00:17.537
Hello. We're here.

01:00:18.903 --> 01:00:24.170
<i>The night brings Johnny's family here</i>

01:00:24.270 --> 01:00:29.303
<i>To take away all that Drac holds dear</i>

01:00:29.403 --> 01:00:32.537
- Welcome, welcome.
- <i>Hide your feelings</i>

01:00:32.637 --> 01:00:37.203
<i>Keep them all inside</i>

01:00:43.270 --> 01:00:46.137
Dude, why do you wanna leave?
This place is out of control.

01:00:46.237 --> 01:00:49.537
- I don't wanna leave.
- All these awesome freakazoids!

01:00:49.637 --> 01:00:53.037
- So, who's the coolest monster?
- Kakie.

01:00:53.137 --> 01:00:56.303
- Kakie.
- Kakie. What a wussbag.

01:00:56.403 --> 01:01:00.037
Isn't it nice to have
the whole family together?

01:01:00.137 --> 01:01:04.203
Mavis, do you have any cousins
or thingies in your family?

01:01:04.303 --> 01:01:06.437
No. It's just been me and Dad.

01:01:06.537 --> 01:01:09.470
I never did ask how you lost your mom.

01:01:09.570 --> 01:01:12.203
She was killed by angry humans.

01:01:12.837 --> 01:01:15.503
<i>Awkward</i>

01:01:15.603 --> 01:01:17.670
But there is my Grandpa Vlad.

01:01:17.770 --> 01:01:19.203
Oh, you have a grandpa?

01:01:19.303 --> 01:01:22.437
Yeah. He'll be at the party.
I invited him.

01:01:22.537 --> 01:01:23.864
You invited him?

01:01:23.964 --> 01:01:28.303
Dad, he's never seen Dennis.
I wanted them to meet once before we go.

01:01:28.403 --> 01:01:32.762
Sure. Great. Peachy. Good old Vlad.

01:01:32.862 --> 01:01:35.181
Anybody have a wet wipe?

01:01:52.370 --> 01:01:56.877
Holy rabies.
He finally invites me to something.

01:01:56.977 --> 01:02:00.170
- He's got a grandkid?
- And he never told you?

01:02:00.270 --> 01:02:04.503
Easy, Bela. At least there's
another vampire in the family.

01:02:04.603 --> 01:02:07.337
It's at a hotel? Fancy schmancy.

01:02:07.437 --> 01:02:10.644
Hotels are for humans!

01:02:15.570 --> 01:02:18.466
Bela, shut your blood hole.
Look what you started.

01:02:18.566 --> 01:02:19.958
Don't worry, gang.

01:02:20.058 --> 01:02:25.337
I raised my son to hate and kill and steal
the souls of humans like a good boy.

01:02:25.837 --> 01:02:28.870
Yes, Grandpa Vlad will be so happy

01:02:28.970 --> 01:02:33.765
when he sees the big masquerade party
Johnny and I have planned.

01:02:33.865 --> 01:02:35.670
What?

01:02:38.270 --> 01:02:41.503
- Play along. It's my dad.
- You have a dad? That's funny.

01:02:41.603 --> 01:02:46.437
Listen to me. My dad cannot know
you're a human. Or any of your family.

01:02:46.537 --> 01:02:48.637
What? But, Drac, I'm proud that we're...

01:02:48.737 --> 01:02:52.603
Or he'll steal your family's souls
and eat your backpack.

01:02:54.337 --> 01:02:59.848
That's right, gang. We're gonna make
the birthday a monster masquerade party.

01:02:59.948 --> 01:03:01.737
- Really?
- Oh, that's lovely.

01:03:01.837 --> 01:03:06.670
Sort of like a last hurrah before Dennis
gets to be with normal people.

01:03:06.770 --> 01:03:09.102
I couldn't have said it better.

01:03:28.103 --> 01:03:32.470
What do you think, Mavis?
I think I'm starting to like being creepy.

01:03:37.137 --> 01:03:40.075
You're lucky we don't
call the authorities.

01:03:40.175 --> 01:03:44.637
Let's go, my hero. Cebause I'm Batman!

01:03:44.737 --> 01:03:47.503
Yes! To the Batmobile!

01:03:52.270 --> 01:03:55.403
Got your butt kicked by a girl, Batman.

01:03:57.070 --> 01:04:00.703
Yeah. Whatever. I'm not about to cry.

01:04:03.303 --> 01:04:06.517
Hotel Transylvania.

01:04:06.617 --> 01:04:10.203
I smell humans!

01:04:10.303 --> 01:04:12.937
Tear it down!

01:04:13.037 --> 01:04:17.570
Bela, we're in the outside world.
You're gonna smell humans.

01:04:17.670 --> 01:04:21.382
You know what? Just wait outside
for me. This is family stuff.

01:04:21.482 --> 01:04:24.903
You'll only get in the way.
I just wanna meet the little fanger.

01:04:25.003 --> 01:04:28.120
- He should know his great-vampa.
- His what?

01:04:28.220 --> 01:04:32.203
Vampire grandpa. Come on.
That was obvious.

01:04:33.837 --> 01:04:35.860
Amazing party!

01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:38.537
So, what do you think?

01:04:38.637 --> 01:04:41.203
This is your vampire costume?
What are you, nuts?

01:04:41.303 --> 01:04:44.519
I ordered it online. It was
the only place that delivered overnight.

01:04:44.619 --> 01:04:46.870
You look like you got
a baboon's butt on your head.

01:04:46.970 --> 01:04:50.943
Have you at least practiced your voice?
You can't just talk like a hippie.

01:04:51.043 --> 01:04:55.103
- I'm not a hippie. I'm a slacker.
- Talk like a vampire.

01:04:55.203 --> 01:05:00.470
My name is Count Jonafang.
I am a vampire.

01:05:00.570 --> 01:05:04.217
Okay, vampires don't go around saying,
"I am a vampire."

01:05:04.317 --> 01:05:09.003
Sorry. I am Count Jonafang.

01:05:09.103 --> 01:05:11.776
- Are you kidding me?
- I'm sorry. I'm nervous.

01:05:11.876 --> 01:05:14.070
Yeah, listen,
if you think I don't like it,

01:05:14.170 --> 01:05:17.675
you definitely don't want to say...
in front of my father.

01:05:17.775 --> 01:05:21.103
- Sir, Master Kakie has arrived.
- Oh, hey.

01:05:21.203 --> 01:05:25.540
Drac, this is Brandon, a.k.a. Kakie.
We got him for Dennis.

01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:28.037
- Hey, man.
- Nauseated to meet you.

01:05:28.137 --> 01:05:31.152
When does this happen?
I got a book fair in half an hour.

01:05:34.537 --> 01:05:37.288
All right. Where's my vampson?

01:05:39.637 --> 01:05:42.966
Oh, please. Still has to make
a dramatic entrance.

01:05:43.066 --> 01:05:45.423
Dad! Look at you!

01:05:45.523 --> 01:05:47.803
So you run a hotel now?

01:05:47.903 --> 01:05:51.637
From Prince of Darkness
to King of Room Service.

01:05:51.737 --> 01:05:54.087
Yes. So good to see you.

01:05:54.187 --> 01:05:57.085
I'll be right with you.

01:06:00.870 --> 01:06:04.603
Keep Vlad away
from the humans and Mavis.

01:06:05.103 --> 01:06:06.371
I'm on it.

01:06:06.903 --> 01:06:10.837
Oh, now that is a neat costume.

01:06:11.162 --> 01:06:13.130
These two smell funny.

01:06:13.230 --> 01:06:17.170
Oh, you're European.
It's called deodorant.

01:06:17.270 --> 01:06:20.399
Nothing like insulting
an entire continent, Linda.

01:06:20.499 --> 01:06:22.503
Hey, Count! How goes it? Frankenstein.

01:06:22.603 --> 01:06:25.970
Actually, I'm technically Frankenstein's
monster. Frankenstein, he's the doctor...

01:06:26.070 --> 01:06:29.154
Would love to hear more. Call my people.

01:06:29.470 --> 01:06:32.979
So, let me introduce you to some
of your son's other buddies.

01:06:33.079 --> 01:06:36.437
- This is Murray.
- Please don't kill me!

01:06:36.537 --> 01:06:39.323
I mean, yo, V! What's up?

01:06:39.423 --> 01:06:42.537
Talking toilet paper.
Well, that's a new one.

01:06:43.070 --> 01:06:45.803
All right! Where's the kid?
That's who I wanna meet.

01:06:45.903 --> 01:06:47.970
Johnny!

01:06:50.037 --> 01:06:52.970
This is Dracula's son-in-law.

01:06:53.070 --> 01:06:57.008
I am Count Jonafang.

01:06:58.290 --> 01:07:02.303
...black sheep. Have you any wool?

01:07:02.403 --> 01:07:06.770
What's that thing on your head?
Looks like my grandmother's boobies.

01:07:09.087 --> 01:07:11.270
Daddy, who's the man
with the funny face?

01:07:11.370 --> 01:07:14.021
- Is this the kid?
- It sure is.

01:07:14.121 --> 01:07:16.682
Let me see those fangs.
What are you doin'?

01:07:16.782 --> 01:07:20.917
Oh, I just love him so much.
I want to hug him right in the fangs...

01:07:21.017 --> 01:07:22.655
that he has.

01:07:24.103 --> 01:07:28.074
I repeat, lemme see those fangs.

01:07:37.003 --> 01:07:40.110
Oh, he's a late fanger, just like you.

01:07:40.210 --> 01:07:43.537
Yes. Yes. Just like me.

01:07:44.537 --> 01:07:47.603
The big shot here
was a little crybaby, all right.

01:07:47.703 --> 01:07:50.023
- Yes, yes, I was.
- Used to pee in his bed.

01:07:50.123 --> 01:07:51.337
Okay, Dad.

01:07:51.437 --> 01:07:54.303
We just need to scare
the fangs out of the kid.

01:07:54.403 --> 01:07:55.809
Hare ha hangs?

01:07:55.909 --> 01:07:58.537
Yeah, it's what I did
for Mr. Tough Guy here.

01:07:58.637 --> 01:08:03.703
First, you've got to possess something
the late fanger finds sweet and innocent.

01:08:03.803 --> 01:08:07.137
Then you show them
what's what and... pop!

01:08:07.237 --> 01:08:11.337
Trust me. It'll scare the fangs
right out. Right, Drac?

01:08:11.437 --> 01:08:15.470
Seriously, guys, if I'm late for
the book fair, I'll miss the street fair.

01:08:16.069 --> 01:08:18.270
That's your guy.

01:08:18.370 --> 01:08:21.136
Possessed? But Dennis will be so upset.

01:08:21.237 --> 01:08:25.425
Don't you get it? This is our ticket.
If it works for Denisovich, boom!

01:08:25.524 --> 01:08:28.170
He's a vampire.
And you all get to stay here.

01:08:28.270 --> 01:08:30.892
All right. All right.

01:08:30.992 --> 01:08:32.670
- Capisce.
- Good call.

01:08:32.970 --> 01:08:35.270
Kids, everyone, have a seat.

01:08:35.370 --> 01:08:38.170
Dennis has a big surprise for you.

01:08:38.270 --> 01:08:42.903
The one and only Kakie,
The Cake Monster!

01:08:43.002 --> 01:08:46.439
Hey, kids! It's me, Kakie!

01:08:46.939 --> 01:08:49.903
What a wonderful Kakie day it is!

01:08:50.002 --> 01:08:54.501
Now, I have a question.
Who here loves cake?

01:09:00.037 --> 01:09:02.154
Rise!

01:09:08.770 --> 01:09:11.837
Why am I floating?
Can I have the stage manager, please?

01:09:11.937 --> 01:09:13.741
This isn't working for me.

01:09:19.970 --> 01:09:23.487
Scary, Denisovich?
You feeling anything? Any change?

01:09:23.587 --> 01:09:25.232
Is Kakie okay?

01:09:26.937 --> 01:09:31.343
I want all the cake.
Sharing is for cowards.

01:09:33.937 --> 01:09:37.303
I don't remember any of this
from the TV show.

01:09:37.403 --> 01:09:40.242
I think I saw it on a Blu-ray disc,
bonus stuff.

01:09:40.341 --> 01:09:42.537
Wait, why is Grandpa Vlad up there?

01:09:48.903 --> 01:09:51.937
I'm scared, Papa.
What's happening to Kakie?

01:09:56.237 --> 01:09:59.803
You don't eat cake. Cake eat you!

01:09:59.903 --> 01:10:01.667
No!

01:10:01.767 --> 01:10:03.837
Stop it!

01:10:05.803 --> 01:10:08.649
What just happened, man? I'm outta here.

01:10:08.749 --> 01:10:12.103
None of these parents
better review this on Yelp.

01:10:12.203 --> 01:10:13.340
Hey, what did you just do?

01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:16.303
A few more seconds and the kid's fangs
would've popped right out.

01:10:16.403 --> 01:10:20.037
- I don't care. It's not worth it.
- What's not worth it?

01:10:20.137 --> 01:10:23.506
It was my last attempt to make
the boy a vampire, so you'd stay.

01:10:23.606 --> 01:10:26.720
By ruining his favorite thing?
How could you do that?

01:10:26.820 --> 01:10:29.337
- We were desperate.
- You were in on this?

01:10:29.437 --> 01:10:32.670
- Dennis won't be happy in my town.
- Dennis hasn't been there.

01:10:32.770 --> 01:10:37.403
<i>Now husband and wife
Feel the strain and the strife</i>

01:10:37.503 --> 01:10:39.220
Shut up!

01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:41.864
Johnny, Dennis is not a monster.

01:10:43.143 --> 01:10:46.670
- He likes avocado.
- 'Cause you don't let him eat anything fun.

01:10:46.770 --> 01:10:51.403
- I think Dennis just wants to be normal.
- Can we stop using the word "normal"?

01:10:51.503 --> 01:10:53.537
Where we live now, he's normal.

01:10:53.637 --> 01:10:57.920
He is who he is.
And you can't change him, Dad.

01:11:00.403 --> 01:11:03.970
- Dennis, where are you going?
- Away.

01:11:05.037 --> 01:11:09.374
But it's not safe out here by yourself.
I know a place where we can hide.

01:11:09.474 --> 01:11:11.570
Follow me.

01:11:17.070 --> 01:11:21.570
If you didn't stop me, my great-grandson
wouldn't have to be a wimp his whole life

01:11:21.670 --> 01:11:23.940
- like Schlumpy over here.
- A wimp?

01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:27.203
- Johnny, be cool.
- You wanna throw down, old man?

01:11:27.303 --> 01:11:31.170
- Certified yellow belt since 1997.
- No!

01:11:31.270 --> 01:11:34.137
What's this now? You're not a vampire?

01:11:35.903 --> 01:11:40.928
Of course he's human. He's our son.
You think we're monsters?

01:11:43.703 --> 01:11:48.470
You! You let your daughter marry
a human and have a human kid?

01:11:48.570 --> 01:11:51.703
Why don't you just put a stake
through my heart.

01:11:51.803 --> 01:11:55.337
We don't hate humans anymore,
and they don't hate us.

01:11:58.903 --> 01:12:01.570
Humans?

01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:03.337
You're a fool.

01:12:03.437 --> 01:12:09.103
Your great-grandson is the sweetest,
kindest, most special boy I've ever met.

01:12:09.203 --> 01:12:13.032
And if you can't give him the love
he deserves because he's half-human,

01:12:13.132 --> 01:12:14.670
then you're the fool.

01:12:15.570 --> 01:12:17.637
Oh, Daddy.

01:12:19.303 --> 01:12:23.017
- Hey, where is Dennis? Dennis!
- Dennis?

01:12:26.203 --> 01:12:29.137
Happy birthday, Dennis.
I made you a treat.

01:12:29.237 --> 01:12:30.411
Dead pigeon?

01:12:30.511 --> 01:12:34.137
Enjoy it. 'Cause once I graduate business
school and start running a company,

01:12:34.237 --> 01:12:37.203
you're not gonna get home-cooked
meals like this anymore.

01:12:37.303 --> 01:12:40.837
I have to move away, Winnie.
To California.

01:12:40.937 --> 01:12:42.970
My mommy thinks I'm not happy here

01:12:43.070 --> 01:12:46.103
cebause I don't have hair
on my face like you.

01:12:46.203 --> 01:12:48.370
I'm sorry I'm not a monster.

01:12:48.470 --> 01:12:51.903
No, you are perfect.
You're the nicest boy I know.

01:12:52.003 --> 01:12:56.537
- And I have 300 brothers.
- You're nice, too, Winnie.

01:13:00.370 --> 01:13:03.088
Well, well, well.

01:13:03.188 --> 01:13:05.670
The little human and his pet.

01:13:05.770 --> 01:13:07.637
- Dennis!
- Denisovich!

01:13:07.737 --> 01:13:10.070
- He's not in the room.
- He's not by the pool.

01:13:10.570 --> 01:13:14.103
- He's not in this pot of soup.
- Where could he be?

01:13:14.203 --> 01:13:17.270
I don't know why I ever invited you.

01:13:33.503 --> 01:13:35.170
Stop squirming.

01:13:35.270 --> 01:13:39.264
- Why are you doing this?
- Because this is wrong.

01:13:39.364 --> 01:13:41.470
Why doesn't anybody get that?

01:13:41.570 --> 01:13:44.768
Humans don't belong with monsters.

01:13:44.868 --> 01:13:47.553
- You're wrong!
- I am not!

01:13:47.653 --> 01:13:50.147
I am holding you hostage.

01:13:50.247 --> 01:13:55.737
And me and my crew are gonna tear
that human-hugging hotel to shreds.

01:13:55.837 --> 01:13:59.195
- You can't.
- Really? Why not?

01:13:59.395 --> 01:14:02.270
- Cebause...
- Cebause, why?

01:14:02.370 --> 01:14:05.253
Cebause it will make Papa Drac sad.

01:14:06.054 --> 01:14:09.705
Sad. And what are you gonna do about it?

01:14:09.805 --> 01:14:13.437
- I don't know.
- You know why you don't know?

01:14:13.537 --> 01:14:18.503
Cebause you're just a weak little boy.

01:14:48.470 --> 01:14:49.495
What was that?

01:14:49.770 --> 01:14:52.305
Dennis, we're coming.

01:14:53.137 --> 01:14:56.929
- Are you okay, Winnie?
- Yes, my zing.

01:15:32.470 --> 01:15:35.437
- Dennis! There he is, right there.
- Dennis! Baby!

01:15:35.537 --> 01:15:38.803
- My big boy!
- Dennis, we were lookin' for ya.

01:15:44.103 --> 01:15:46.470
There's his mean friends.

01:15:52.792 --> 01:15:55.237
This'll be fun.

01:16:55.420 --> 01:16:56.689
I didn't do that.

01:17:08.537 --> 01:17:10.970
- You rock, Dennis.
- He means Denisovich.

01:17:11.070 --> 01:17:12.596
Kakie rules!

01:17:23.070 --> 01:17:25.303
Dennis, I'm coming.

01:17:29.903 --> 01:17:32.270
I knew all that practice would pay off.

01:17:55.970 --> 01:17:58.752
That's right, you better fly away.

01:17:59.870 --> 01:18:05.303
Papa Drac, I'm a vampire
and a superhero. Am I cool now?

01:18:05.403 --> 01:18:08.827
"Now"? Dennis, you were always cool.

01:18:08.927 --> 01:18:13.470
Human, vampire, unicorn,
you're perfect no matter what.

01:18:13.570 --> 01:18:17.737
But since I'm a vampire,
can we stay here?

01:18:18.137 --> 01:18:19.303
Yes.

01:18:19.403 --> 01:18:21.970
- All right! Yeah!
- All right!

01:18:23.587 --> 01:18:27.970
But you have to know, we're going
to visit you here every holiday.

01:18:28.070 --> 01:18:30.303
That's fine.

01:18:45.670 --> 01:18:50.173
Don't ever come near me
or my family again.

01:18:53.403 --> 01:18:55.243
No!

01:19:03.537 --> 01:19:07.362
Daddy, you just saved a human.

01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:12.220
All this pressure about
when the boy's fangs were coming out.

01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:16.553
Who cares?
Mine came out years ago! Look.

01:19:17.670 --> 01:19:20.603
Okay, Dad, put 'em back in
before we all barf.

01:19:20.703 --> 01:19:24.655
Hey! Isn't it still somebody's birthday?

01:20:20.537 --> 01:20:23.103
Let me hear you sing!

01:20:24.303 --> 01:20:25.980
I didn't do that.
