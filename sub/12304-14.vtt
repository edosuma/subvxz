Almost there.

Almost there.

01:12.230 --> 01:14.000
What the hell's this guy doing behind us?

01:15.600 --> 01:17.400
Wave him around.

01:17.460 --> 01:19.400
Come on.

01:19.460 --> 01:21.460

That's county property!

I repeat, drop those guns immediately!

This is Charlie Seven.

Miami-Dade Police.

03:34.000 --> 03:38.030
They were headed to the Folton Steel Mill incinerator.

03:38.100 --> 03:40.500
Had an annual shipment of confiscated guns

Alex,this is his nine millimeter.

will you ask DNA to put a rush on this.

04:27.560 --> 04:29.730
Priority number one.

05:36.580 --> 05:39.410
DELKO: The empty trailer provided the perfect barricade.

05:39.480 --> 05:41.280
PD says it was stolen from the port.

05:42.580 --> 05:44.740
What do you think launched this delivery truck?

05:44.810 --> 05:46.210
I don't know.

05:46.280 --> 05:48.640
It's definitely some sort of explosive.

05:48.710 --> 05:50.740
Fuel tank,maybe?

05:50.810 --> 05:53.140
No,it's intact.

05:53.210 --> 05:54.710
Take a look at this.

(sighs)

06:01.780 --> 06:03.110
I don't know.

With cargo another two.

06:09.180 --> 06:10.440
Hmm.

06:10.510 --> 06:13.080
Well,whatever it is, it packed a punch.

06:21.710 --> 06:23.080
||I know what it is.

06:23.140 --> 06:25.140
It's a manhole cover.

06:32.810 --> 06:34.280
This is it.

06:36.910 --> 06:38.510
This is where it came from.

06:38.580 --> 06:41.740
Someone's placed a conical-shaped charge in here.

06:43.410 --> 06:45.510
Yeah,probably C-4.

06:45.580 --> 06:47.740
It's a big-time explosive.

06:47.810 --> 06:50.640
Turned the manhole cover into a high velocity missile.

06:50.710 --> 06:53.480
Then the 18-wheeler just steered them right into it.

06:53.540 --> 06:55.080
Physics took over from there.

06:55.140 --> 06:58.410
It dumped the truck on its side, doors broke open,

06:58.480 --> 06:59.940
it's Christmas in Miami.

07:00.010 --> 07:01.540
(chuckles): What they didn't count on,

07:01.610 --> 07:03.910
was leaving a trail of bread crumbs behind.

07:09.010 --> 07:10.380
That's a shock tube.

07:10.440 --> 07:12.540
It's just a fancy word for fuse.

07:12.610 --> 07:14.580
Someone had to be on the other end of that tube

07:14.640 --> 07:15.780
to flip a switch.

07:15.840 --> 07:17.380
And whoever it was needed

07:17.440 --> 07:19.880
to have a clear line of sight so they knew when to trigger it.

07:19.940 --> 07:21.380
Exactly.

Look,we follow that tube to a nearby manhole cover,

14:57.390 --> 14:59.260
He did it behind closed doors,Frank.

17:18.560 --> 17:20.589
Well,let's worry about first things first.

17:43.990 --> 17:46.620
so I'm searching the Department of Corrections database.

17:46.690 --> 17:48.460
May not have to.

17:48.520 --> 17:51.290
Gilberto Tavez.

17:51.360 --> 17:52.320
It's their dad.

17:52.390 --> 17:53.820
He did seven years,

17:53.890 --> 17:55.920
Miami-West Prison for manslaughter.

17:55.990 --> 17:57.260
He just got out nine days ago.

17:57.320 --> 18:00.520
All right, then let's track him down.

18:04.060 --> 18:06.690
(sirens wailing)

18:13.660 --> 18:15.620
What's this about?

18:15.690 --> 18:18.590
Your son Jesse is dead,Mr. Tavez.

18:31.520 --> 18:33.090
We got some blood.

18:35.790 --> 18:38.060
Not to mention a footprint that matches your prison shoe.

18:38.120 --> 18:39.390
Have you got anything you want to tell me?

18:39.460 --> 18:40.890
I got nothing to hide.

18:40.960 --> 18:43.990
I just got sprung out of Miami-West.

18:44.060 --> 18:46.060
That hundred gate goes fast.

18:46.120 --> 18:47.290
So I stopped by my house,

18:47.360 --> 18:49.890
hit up my kid,Camille, for some cash.

18:49.960 --> 18:51.090
Did she give it to you?

18:51.160 --> 18:53.360
She wasn't home,you know?

18:53.420 --> 18:55.760
I was gonna wait,but then I heard this gun go off.

18:55.820 --> 18:57.860
<i>(gunshot)  And that was it for me.</i>

18:57.920 --> 19:00.220
<i>Last thing I want is  to go back to lock-up.</i>

19:10.660 --> 19:12.460
What about your son?

19:15.160 --> 19:18.790
You just left him there?

19:18.860 --> 19:21.260
What could I do?

19:21.320 --> 19:23.720
Be a human being,for starters.

19:25.920 --> 19:28.020
Lock him up.

19:28.090 --> 19:29.820
Impound the truck,please.

19:38.260 --> 19:40.960
|| He's saying Camille wasn't home at the time of the shooting.

19:41.020 --> 19:43.620
She said she was.

19:45.660 --> 19:48.560
I hate to say it,but,um...

19:48.620 --> 19:51.690
I think the truth lies in that family.

19:52.720 --> 19:55.120
Yeah.

20:00.020 --> 20:01.990
Hey. Calleigh said you were in the print lab

20:02.060 --> 20:03.920
working some of your magic.

20:03.990 --> 20:05.820
Yeah. That remains to be seen.

20:05.890 --> 20:08.290
I took the one and only partial we found on the initiator

20:08.360 --> 20:09.890
and ran it through AFIS. Gave me this guy.

20:09.960 --> 20:11.560
Richard Williams?

20:11.620 --> 20:13.020
Yeah. Criminal history says he's been

20:13.090 --> 20:15.190
arrested for burglary and arson, but I think it's time

20:15.260 --> 20:16.960
to find out if he dabbles in explosives.

20:30.060 --> 20:32.990
|| What's that? A garage door opener?

20:33.060 --> 20:35.460
It's an initiator. Fingerprints say that you handled it.

20:35.520 --> 20:37.760
Used in a gun heist this morning.

20:37.820 --> 20:39.920
It was used to detonate a bomb.

20:39.990 --> 20:42.090
Yeah,heard about it on the news.

20:42.160 --> 20:44.320
I didn't blow up anything.

20:44.390 --> 20:46.190
I sold a bunch of these.

20:46.260 --> 20:47.360
Made 15 grand.

20:47.420 --> 20:48.920
Who bought them,Richard?

20:48.990 --> 20:51.420
Couple of guys from Baracas.

20:51.490 --> 20:52.990
Paid cash.

20:53.060 --> 20:54.960
Knew exactly what they wanted.

20:55.020 --> 20:56.790
I should've held out for more.

20:56.860 --> 20:58.490
You detonated the bomb.

20:58.560 --> 21:00.860
You work for Clavo Cruz, don't you?

21:03.120 --> 21:04.890
If I did,

21:04.960 --> 21:07.490
why would I ever admit to being a part of this heist?

21:07.560 --> 21:10.560
From what I saw on WFOR,

21:10.620 --> 21:12.890
pretty sloppy.

21:12.960 --> 21:14.990
Neighborhood walked off with half the cargo.

21:15.060 --> 21:17.620
We're interested in the cargo you did get.

21:18.760 --> 21:20.620
Try zero.

21:20.690 --> 21:22.690
Swab Richard,Eric.

21:24.120 --> 21:27.360
|| Now,we can put Clavo's cousin at the scene--

21:27.420 --> 21:29.390
he killed a cop.

21:29.460 --> 21:30.920
We can put you there,too.

21:30.990 --> 21:32.920
Hold out your hands. For what?

21:32.990 --> 21:36.060
Gonna get your confession in a different way.

21:45.160 --> 21:46.660
DELKO: Trace results show that Richard

21:46.720 --> 21:49.690
handled the explosives from the manhole cover.

21:49.760 --> 21:52.920
But the most interesting thing is that GC/MS says

21:52.990 --> 21:54.820
that his hands were covered in nitroglycerin.

21:54.890 --> 21:56.920
The LC/MS says that there were also traces

21:56.990 --> 21:58.090
of potassium perchlorate

21:58.160 --> 21:59.290
which packs a bigger punch.

21:59.360 --> 22:00.620
You think it's commercial?

22:00.690 --> 22:02.790
It certainly does. It may be military ordnance.

22:02.860 --> 22:04.790
Do we have a list of weapons targeted

22:04.860 --> 22:06.060
for disposal?

22:06.120 --> 22:08.420
Yeah. Yeah,I'll bring it up.

22:08.490 --> 22:10.720
(keyboard clacking)

22:15.620 --> 22:16.790
It's lot of weapons.

22:16.860 --> 22:19.190
Yes,it is,but Mr. Williams

22:19.260 --> 22:20.360
was only interested in one.

22:21.890 --> 22:24.620
Wait a second. Go back to that.

22:29.760 --> 22:31.420
A LAW rocket.

22:31.490 --> 22:33.020
He stole a LAW rocket.

22:33.090 --> 22:34.890
A rocket launcher?

22:34.960 --> 22:36.820
(explosion)

22:50.860 --> 22:52.990
Williams wants that kind of firepower,

22:53.060 --> 22:54.120
it's to break into something.

22:54.190 --> 22:55.920
Or break someone out. Frank.

22:55.990 --> 22:57.120
Flag on the play,gentlemen.

22:57.190 --> 22:58.520
Clavo Cruz is being

22:58.590 --> 23:00.820
walked over to the courthouse,Department B,

23:00.890 --> 23:02.720
for his arraignment as we speak.

23:04.760 --> 23:06.260
He planned the stabbing

23:06.320 --> 23:08.160
'cause it's easier to escape from the courthouse.

23:08.220 --> 23:10.120
That's correct. Frank,

23:10.190 --> 23:11.520
call that courthouse

23:11.590 --> 23:13.760
and tell them to evacuate the building immediately.

23:17.090 --> 23:18.260
Courthouse security.

23:18.320 --> 23:20.320
This is Detective Tripp, Miami-Dade.

23:20.390 --> 23:21.660
We have an imminent bomb threat.

23:21.720 --> 23:23.590
Evacuate that building immediately.

23:27.890 --> 23:29.360
(gavel bangs)

23:29.420 --> 23:32.120
JUDGE: This arraignment for Clavo Cruz is now over.

23:32.190 --> 23:33.220
Next case on the docket.

23:33.290 --> 23:35.560
Horatio? She's down there,Frank.

23:35.620 --> 23:37.360
Alexx? Alexx,sweetheart, where are you? Yeah?

23:37.420 --> 23:39.690
|| Just walked into a courtroom. What's wrong,H?

23:39.760 --> 23:41.420
Alexx,I need you to get out of there right now.

23:41.490 --> 23:42.620
Alexx?

23:42.690 --> 23:44.520
(explosion)

23:44.590 --> 23:46.060
(glass shattering)

23:49.390 --> 23:51.420
Alexx?Alexx?

24:18.910 --> 24:21.210
CAINE: Alexx! Horatio!

24:27.240 --> 24:28.440
Alexx.

24:28.510 --> 24:30.810
Are you okay?

24:30.870 --> 24:33.270
What the hell just happened here,Horatio?

24:33.340 --> 24:36.340
That's what we're going to find out.

24:39.740 --> 24:41.170
It's the bailiff.

24:41.240 --> 24:43.340
The bailiff, and his weapon is missing.

24:43.410 --> 24:44.540
Lieutenant.

24:44.610 --> 24:46.510
Clavo Cruz is gone.

24:46.570 --> 24:48.640
Clavo Cruz. Clavo Cruz,Alexx,

24:48.710 --> 24:50.470
was scheduled to be arraigned in this courtroom.

24:50.540 --> 24:52.540
Put out a broadcast. He's armed and dangerous.

24:52.610 --> 24:55.210
Will do.

24:55.270 --> 24:57.010
Alexx,you need to be looked at.

24:57.070 --> 24:58.140
Get looked at,okay?

24:58.210 --> 25:00.110
Later.

25:00.170 --> 25:01.270
I'm okay,Horatio.

25:01.340 --> 25:02.510
I'm needed here.

25:04.070 --> 25:06.710
Hey. Hey. This one has blood coming out of his ears.

25:06.770 --> 25:08.270
It might be internal bleeding.

25:08.340 --> 25:10.170
He needs to go first,okay?

25:39.240 --> 25:41.240
♪ ♪

26:11.670 --> 26:14.340
This guy fired the rocket.

26:14.410 --> 26:16.610
Weapon's exhaust must've cooked him.

26:16.670 --> 26:18.810
More concerned about being concealed

26:18.870 --> 26:20.570
than his own safety,Frank.

26:31.770 --> 26:34.110
I'm going to need surveillance tapes

26:34.170 --> 26:35.910
from the courtroom.

26:53.840 --> 26:56.740
Are my brothers okay out there?

26:56.810 --> 26:57.910
They'll be fine.

26:57.970 --> 26:59.640
They've got an officer with them.

26:59.710 --> 27:01.940
Why do we have to be here?

27:02.010 --> 27:05.110
Because I know that you lied to me,Camille.

27:06.140 --> 27:07.410
Your father just got out

27:07.470 --> 27:09.310
of prison,but you told me he was dead.

27:10.340 --> 27:12.440
My mom is.

27:12.510 --> 27:13.840
He might as well be.

27:13.910 --> 27:16.670
You also said that you were home today

27:16.740 --> 27:18.810
when the shot was fired.

27:18.870 --> 27:20.440
Where were you?

27:20.510 --> 27:22.610
I was working.

27:22.670 --> 27:24.810
I picked up an extra cleaning job.

27:24.870 --> 27:26.310
Two bus rides away.

27:26.370 --> 27:28.370
Big house,pays extra.

27:28.440 --> 27:29.840
Can anyone verify that?

27:29.910 --> 27:32.470
Nobody was there.

27:32.540 --> 27:34.210
Key was on top of the door frame.

27:34.270 --> 27:35.810
Money under the coffee can.

27:35.870 --> 27:37.210
Two 20s and a ten.

27:37.270 --> 27:39.610
Why didn't you tell me this before?

27:39.670 --> 27:41.810
(sighs)

27:41.870 --> 27:44.440
I only have temporary custody of my brothers.

27:44.510 --> 27:47.710
If I get caught leaving them on their own,

27:47.770 --> 27:50.170
my father will get the boys.

28:00.570 --> 28:02.570
Did you shoot your little brother?

28:05.570 --> 28:07.370
Look,there was a weapons truck

28:07.440 --> 28:08.740
that overturned near your house today,

28:08.810 --> 28:10.740
and a lot of people scooped up weapons.

28:10.810 --> 28:12.870
People who aren't trained to use them.

28:12.940 --> 28:17.410
I realize that Jesse's shooting could have been an accident.

28:17.470 --> 28:19.640
And if you level with me, I can help you.

28:19.710 --> 28:21.040
Nobody helps me.

28:33.670 --> 28:35.840
Well,the blood drops that they found in the back of the truck,

28:35.910 --> 28:37.010
those are from our victim,right?

28:37.070 --> 28:39.470
Yeah,DNA evidence confirms that.

28:39.540 --> 28:41.570
So we got the truck here to recreate the scene.

28:41.640 --> 28:43.970
This is a... evidence photo.

28:44.040 --> 28:46.670
The blood drops are gravitational.

28:46.740 --> 28:48.740
So that means that Jesse was upright

28:48.810 --> 28:50.470
in the back of the truck, when he was shot.

28:50.540 --> 28:52.740
Exactly.

29:04.140 --> 29:06.770
|| So where did the bullet come from?

29:06.840 --> 29:08.610
Alexx's report said that the gunshot wound

29:08.670 --> 29:10.110
was from front to back

29:10.170 --> 29:12.510
and that the round lodged in his thoracic vertebrae.

29:20.270 --> 29:23.610
|| Had to have come from a second-story window.

29:23.670 --> 29:25.110
Just like that one.

29:28.970 --> 29:31.670
I'm going to go check out that room.

29:40.210 --> 29:41.640
|| What do you want in my room?

29:50.140 --> 29:52.110
Why is my dad's truck here?

29:52.170 --> 29:54.510
Now that's where your brother was

29:54.570 --> 29:55.870
when he got shot.

30:06.510 --> 30:09.170
|| This laser tells us that,uh...

30:13.070 --> 30:16.840
Laser tells us that the,uh...

30:16.910 --> 30:18.910
the bullet came from this room.

30:24.240 --> 30:26.070
I found the gun in our trash barrel.

30:27.440 --> 30:28.910
<i>I mean...  I just brought it up here</i>

30:28.970 --> 30:30.970
<i>to check it out.</i>

30:52.410 --> 30:54.210
(gunshot) Oh,God!

31:02.110 --> 31:03.570
(gasps)

31:13.610 --> 31:16.010
I gonna miss my little brother.

31:17.210 --> 31:19.410
So stupid.

31:21.440 --> 31:23.340
I don't think you're stupid.

31:23.410 --> 31:25.710
I think that you're probably just,uh...

31:27.340 --> 31:29.870
...probably just scared.

31:31.110 --> 31:33.010
I always swore I'd never go to prison...

31:36.040 --> 31:37.910
...like my dad.

31:40.510 --> 31:41.910
But I deserve it.

31:43.940 --> 31:46.110
No,you don't.

31:46.170 --> 31:48.270
I killed my little brother.

31:52.610 --> 31:54.070
You know,uh...

31:54.140 --> 31:58.940
you don't go to prison for... for accidents.

32:10.210 --> 32:12.210
What happens now?

32:12.270 --> 32:14.770
Well,I'm gonna take your statement.

32:16.970 --> 32:20.610
And then you're gonna tell your sister what happened.

32:27.340 --> 32:29.210
Surveillance from the courthouse?

32:29.270 --> 32:30.870
Yeah,but nothing from the courtroom.

32:30.940 --> 32:32.210
Those cameras were destroyed.

32:32.270 --> 32:34.310
I understand. Try the parking structure.

32:34.370 --> 32:36.910
I've been through that,too. No sign of Clavo Cruz.

32:36.970 --> 32:39.770
But that is public parking. Try employee.

32:39.840 --> 32:42.570
Oh,yeah. Here. Let me check that out.

32:42.640 --> 32:45.940
Now you see your timecode says 6:00 a.m.

32:46.010 --> 32:48.570
Move it up to the time of the explosion.

32:48.640 --> 32:50.910
Elevator doors,no one's there.

32:50.970 --> 32:52.040
Try the stairs.

32:55.740 --> 32:57.570
H,there he is. He's got someone with him.

32:57.640 --> 32:59.870
He's got his ride,Mr. Cooper.

33:12.370 --> 33:15.010
H,they were parked in space 227.

33:16.670 --> 33:19.670
Frank,he's got a hostage.

33:19.740 --> 33:22.110
CAINE: What did we get on the parking space,Frank?

33:22.170 --> 33:24.170
TRIPP: Parking space belongs to a Cathy Gibson.

33:24.240 --> 33:26.440
She was the court stenographer for Cruz's arraignment.

33:26.510 --> 33:28.510
Contact information?

33:28.570 --> 33:31.410
Yeah. Home phone and cell phone.

33:35.870 --> 33:37.370
Cathy.

33:37.440 --> 33:39.040
Cathy,this is Horatio Caine.

(normal voice): No.

33:42.310 --> 33:44.970
It's me,dude. Clavo.

33:45.040 --> 33:46.640
I knew you'd find me.

33:46.710 --> 33:48.810
Looks like we're in play again.

33:48.870 --> 33:50.510
What do you want,Clavo?

33:50.570 --> 33:53.510
You just be in front of the Golden Beach National Bank

33:53.570 --> 33:54.910
on Eleventh Street,

33:54.970 --> 33:57.140
and I'll get you up to speed, okay,compadre?

33:57.210 --> 33:58.210
And,Horatio...

33:58.270 --> 34:00.140
come alone.

34:00.210 --> 34:01.670
Don't be late...

34:01.740 --> 34:03.540
or she dies.

34:03.610 --> 34:06.110
Clavo,I want you to listen to me.

34:06.170 --> 34:09.040
<i>If you harm this woman,  you are going to die.</i>

34:09.110 --> 34:11.370
Are you going to keep making threats

34:11.440 --> 34:13.270
or you going to catch me?

34:26.120 --> 34:28.719
CAINE: Clavo.

34:28.790 --> 34:31.889
(chuckles softly)

34:32.920 --> 34:35.389
This bank look familiar,Caine?

34:35.449 --> 34:39.120
It should. It's where you deposit your little city wage.

34:40.150 --> 34:41.920
Where's the girl?

34:41.989 --> 34:44.190
She's safe...

34:44.250 --> 34:45.920
for now.

34:45.989 --> 34:48.420
Why don't you take me to her.

34:49.449 --> 34:50.850
Take it easy,huh?

34:50.920 --> 34:52.750
First I need your to do a little business for me.

34:52.820 --> 34:55.219
Now you're going to walk into that bank,

34:55.290 --> 34:57.320
and you're going to withdraw one million dollars

34:57.390 --> 34:58.520
from your account.

34:58.590 --> 35:01.050
It's quite a city wage.

35:03.090 --> 35:05.750
I had it wired from overseas.

35:05.820 --> 35:08.620
See,the banks in this country got no love for me anymore,

35:08.690 --> 35:09.690
thanks to you.

35:09.750 --> 35:11.090
So I was forced to improvise.

35:11.150 --> 35:13.690
And why would I do this?

35:19.320 --> 35:23.150
That's why.

35:23.220 --> 35:25.220
She's cute,huh?

35:25.290 --> 35:28.890
She's tied up in the trunk of a Mercedes.

35:28.950 --> 35:31.350
Soon as I get my Benjamins, you get her.

35:31.420 --> 35:32.720

35:32.790 --> 35:34.120

35:40.350 --> 35:41.920
Why don't we leave her out of this?

35:41.990 --> 35:45.790
CLAVO: You took everything from me.

35:45.850 --> 35:48.550
And now it's time for you to give something back.

35:49.590 --> 35:51.920
You can't pull this off,Clavo.

35:51.990 --> 35:53.550
