<i>Previously on </i>Star Trek: Discovery:

00:14.806 --> 00:18.309
[Burnham] <i>Seven hundred years after</i>
<i>we left, dilithium supplies dried up.</i>

00:18.393 --> 00:19.978
<i>Then came the Burn.</i>

00:20.061 --> 00:22.647
<i>No one knows how or why it happened,</i>

00:22.731 --> 00:25.483
<i>but in an instant,</i>
<i>all dilithium went inert.</i>

00:25.567 --> 00:28.111
<i>Any ship</i>
<i>with an active warp core detonated.</i>

00:29.362 --> 00:33.324
This is where the Burn started,
the Verubin Nebula.

00:33.408 --> 00:36.161
There's a signal coming
from the center of the nebula?

00:36.244 --> 00:39.998
The message is over a hundred years old,
made a few years before the Burn.

00:40.081 --> 00:43.251
This is Dr. Issa of the KSF <i>Khi'eth.</i>

00:43.334 --> 00:45.045
She started being affected
by the radiation.

00:45.128 --> 00:47.839
-Those marks on her forehead...
-...all channels.

00:47.922 --> 00:50.300
We are stranded,
but we have not lost hope.

00:50.383 --> 00:52.385
I have a Kelpien research vessel

00:52.469 --> 00:55.930
and a captain who hasn't seen another
Kelpien face since he got here.

00:56.014 --> 00:58.224
I wouldn't blame you
if you were a little distracted.

00:58.308 --> 01:00.894
I assure you, admiral,
that is not the case.

01:00.977 --> 01:02.812
I would like you to serve

01:02.896 --> 01:06.066
as my acting first officer
till I find a permanent replacement.

01:06.149 --> 01:08.610
[Vance] Osyraa is desperate for dilithium.

01:08.693 --> 01:10.236
<i>Discovery </i>has a spore drive.

01:10.320 --> 01:11.529
It's not a good combination.

01:11.613 --> 01:14.282
We're going to have to be
exceptionally careful at all times.

01:14.574 --> 01:16.576
[suspenseful music playing]

01:18.453 --> 01:22.373
<i>You have just sealed your own fate</i>
<i>and the fate of the Federation.</i>

01:22.457 --> 01:25.919
<i>I promise you will feel the full weight</i>
<i>of the Chain.</i>

01:26.920 --> 01:28.755
You were angry with Gray--

01:28.838 --> 01:29.798
I don't miss him.

01:29.881 --> 01:31.216
I mean, if he was here right now,

01:31.299 --> 01:33.384
I would thank him
for leaving without a word.

01:33.468 --> 01:36.054
Maybe he's doing what he thinks is best.

01:36.137 --> 01:38.848
He doesn't get to decide
what's good for me.

01:39.557 --> 01:43.728
You have always been far greater
than you could imagine, Michael.

01:44.437 --> 01:45.897
So have you, Philippa.

01:49.108 --> 01:51.611
-[Saru] She will not return.
-[Burnham] Never.

01:51.694 --> 01:53.071
Then she is deceased.

01:54.531 --> 01:55.698
To Philippa.

01:55.782 --> 01:57.242
[all] To Philippa.

02:01.663 --> 02:03.665
[tender music playing]

02:11.673 --> 02:13.550
[Burnham] Georgiou was something else.

02:13.842 --> 02:15.260
Such a force of nature.

02:16.469 --> 02:18.012
[indistinct chatter]

02:22.809 --> 02:25.353
[Stamets] Wherever she is,
I'm sure she's giving them hell.

02:25.436 --> 02:28.148
[Adira] You guys are really lucky
to have each other.

02:29.107 --> 02:30.817
You're a part of that, you know.

02:31.526 --> 02:32.527
You have them...

02:33.695 --> 02:35.572
and you have us.

02:35.655 --> 02:37.198
I miss her already.

02:37.282 --> 02:39.242
We're sort of a package deal.

02:41.244 --> 02:42.620
You have me, too.

02:47.125 --> 02:48.251
You're back?

02:49.335 --> 02:51.421
-Is that Gray? Gray's here?
-Um...

02:52.797 --> 02:55.383
You're lucky
that we are at a memorial service

02:55.466 --> 02:57.302
or I'd be giving you a piece of my mind.

02:58.428 --> 03:01.598
-Um, I'll just be checking some data.
-Yeah.

03:06.895 --> 03:08.771
I'm sorry. I...

03:10.773 --> 03:12.358
That-- Is that it?

03:12.901 --> 03:16.362
What, you show up out of nowhere,
and then you're sorry?

03:16.446 --> 03:20.199
I just-- I haven't known how to be.

03:21.743 --> 03:25.872
You get to interact with the world
and be who you are,

03:25.955 --> 03:27.457
and I'm just...

03:27.999 --> 03:29.083
stuck.

03:31.002 --> 03:35.506
You're the only one that can see me,
and that's not how it's supposed to be.

03:35.590 --> 03:37.634
I'm supposed to be connected.

03:38.176 --> 03:41.179
But that doesn't excuse my disappearing.

03:41.930 --> 03:42.931
[exhales sharply]

03:43.014 --> 03:45.350
But I get it.

03:46.517 --> 03:48.853
As much as I can, anyway.

03:49.395 --> 03:50.813
We'll figure this out.

03:51.439 --> 03:53.066
We're gonna figure this out.

03:54.817 --> 03:56.069
[computer beeping]

03:57.028 --> 03:59.364
Computer must have found data
from the <i>Khi'eth.</i>

03:59.447 --> 04:01.574
The Kelpien ship
where the message came from.

04:03.576 --> 04:04.535
Oh, my God.

04:04.619 --> 04:06.162
Captain, um...

04:06.955 --> 04:09.207
the <i>Khi'eth, </i>there's a life sign.

04:09.290 --> 04:13.002
Someone is alive inside that ship.

04:15.088 --> 04:17.924
Wait, how is that possible?
The crash happened before the Burn.

04:18.007 --> 04:19.425
The radiation alone...

04:20.468 --> 04:23.137
How could Dr. lssa survive that long?

04:24.264 --> 04:25.139
Not her.

04:26.766 --> 04:27.600
The child.

04:28.184 --> 04:29.269
[dramatic music playing]

04:29.352 --> 04:30.603
Child?

04:31.980 --> 04:37.318
Those marks on Dr. lssa's head,
they were not from radiation poisoning.

04:40.530 --> 04:41.614
She was pregnant.

04:43.992 --> 04:46.619
We need to set course
for the Verubin Nebula.

04:47.870 --> 04:49.872
[suspenseful music playing]

04:51.124 --> 04:53.793
[Owo] The crash site is 200 kilometers
into the nebula.

04:53.876 --> 04:56.587
[Detmer] There's a nasty storm in there.
I'll do my best.

04:56.671 --> 04:58.256
[Saru] Take us in, lieutenant. Quickly.

04:58.339 --> 05:00.842
Whoever's down there,
they've been waiting for rescue.

05:00.925 --> 05:01.801
Aye, sir.

05:05.847 --> 05:07.557
[Saru] Shields up. Red alert.

05:07.807 --> 05:08.683
[grunts]

05:08.975 --> 05:09.809
[alarm blaring]

05:09.892 --> 05:11.686
We're being barraged
by ionizing radiation.

05:12.270 --> 05:14.439
-Scan for the life sign.
-[rumbling]

05:14.522 --> 05:16.482
Way too much
subspace density interference.

05:16.566 --> 05:18.943
Damn it.
This storm is not supposed to be this bad.

05:19.027 --> 05:20.903
Got a mass of hydrogen
and dust collapsing.

05:20.987 --> 05:22.905
Hang on! [grunts]

05:28.328 --> 05:29.495
Shields at 80 percent.

05:29.579 --> 05:32.248
-Where is our secondary emitter?
-Nilsson's working on it.

05:32.332 --> 05:33.624
Shields down to 60 percent.

05:33.708 --> 05:34.834
Captain?

05:34.917 --> 05:37.378
-Take us closer to the planet.
-If we lose shields,

05:37.462 --> 05:40.548
-the hull breach will be catastrophic.
-We cannot simply leave.

05:41.716 --> 05:42.967
Shields at 50 percent.

05:43.051 --> 05:43.926
Scan again.

05:44.010 --> 05:45.053
Captain.

05:45.928 --> 05:46.763
[all grunt]

05:47.472 --> 05:48.347
Captain Saru.

05:50.808 --> 05:52.393
Let me take my ship in to scout.

05:52.477 --> 05:55.188
<i>Discovery's </i>too big.
Radiation winds hit you like a sail.

05:55.271 --> 05:57.565
I've lost 10 percent
of starboard-side thrusters.

05:57.648 --> 05:59.650
My ship is smaller and can morph.

06:00.443 --> 06:02.111
She can take the heat. Trust me.

06:03.863 --> 06:05.323
Go. And be safe, Mr. Booker.

06:05.406 --> 06:06.282
Mr. Bryce.

06:06.365 --> 06:08.159
-Transport him now.
-[whirring]

06:22.840 --> 06:23.674
[sighs]

06:24.884 --> 06:25.718
[sighs]

06:25.802 --> 06:26.844
You in, Book?

06:26.928 --> 06:28.763
-[Book] Yeah.
-[Burnham] <i>Let us know the moment</i>

06:28.846 --> 06:31.849
-<i>you get a clear scan of the life sign.</i>
-[Book] Copy that.

06:31.933 --> 06:35.269
Found a subspace fissure. Should make it
possible to complete the scan.

06:41.359 --> 06:43.694
[computer]
<i>Warning. Radiation breach detected.</i>

06:48.241 --> 06:49.075
Come on.

06:49.158 --> 06:50.701
How are shields holding, Book?

06:50.785 --> 06:52.787
[Book] <i>Diverting auxiliary power</i>
<i>to strengthen them.</i>

06:52.870 --> 06:55.081
Found the ship's approximate landing site.

06:56.666 --> 06:58.459
[computer] <i>Emergency force fields failing.</i>

06:58.543 --> 07:00.628
<i>-Radiation at critical level.</i>
-[Book grunting]

07:08.052 --> 07:10.263
[Burnham in distorted voice]
<i>Book, how are you doing?</i>

07:10.346 --> 07:11.597
<i>Book?</i>

07:12.181 --> 07:16.227
-[Burnham in normal voice] <i>Book?</i>
-[computer] <i>Life sign detected.</i>

07:16.310 --> 07:18.980
Got the life sign. In a structure
with breathable atmosphere.

07:19.063 --> 07:20.356
<i>Has to be the crashed ship.</i>

07:20.440 --> 07:21.691
<i>Transmitting coordinates.</i>

07:23.443 --> 07:24.819
I have a visual on the planet.

07:24.902 --> 07:27.196
Located a pocket
where <i>Discovery </i>can jump safely.

07:27.280 --> 07:28.197
Got them.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.658
We got the coordinates.
Get the hell out of there.

07:30.741 --> 07:33.161
-[thumping]
-[groans]

07:33.744 --> 07:35.204
-Mr. Booker?
-[Book groans over comms]

07:36.914 --> 07:37.790
I'm fine.

07:40.001 --> 07:42.712
-[Book sighs over comms]
-[computer over comms] <i>Autopilot engaged.</i>

07:48.718 --> 07:50.595
[Saru]<i> </i>I trust Mr. Booker
will be all right?

07:50.678 --> 07:54.223
[Burnham] Culber said he should be fine
after a few cycles of DNA recombination.

07:54.307 --> 07:57.435
[Saru] Good. Then let us see
what Ensign Tilly has for us.

08:01.189 --> 08:04.233
The data from Book's ship shows
that <i>Khi'eth </i>crashed

08:04.317 --> 08:06.527
into a massive supply of dilithium.

08:07.111 --> 08:09.989
Well, they were on a mission
to investigate a dilithium nursery.

08:10.072 --> 08:14.577
Sir, I'm reading that there is dilithium
dispersed throughout this entire planet.

08:15.578 --> 08:17.580
[dramatic music playing]

08:17.663 --> 08:20.082
We triangulated those black boxes.

08:20.166 --> 08:21.959
Ni'Var's data led us to the nebula.

08:23.002 --> 08:25.379
Now we find a dilithium planet inside?

08:32.470 --> 08:35.056
I think we may have just found
the source of the Burn.

08:37.266 --> 08:39.268
[theme music playing]

10:07.732 --> 10:09.525
[explosions in distance]

10:09.609 --> 10:11.611
[dramatic music playing]

10:16.407 --> 10:18.284
A planet made of dilithium.

10:21.203 --> 10:24.123
The Federation could use
that kind of news right about now.

10:24.206 --> 10:25.291
Nice work.

10:25.958 --> 10:27.335
And the life sign?

10:27.418 --> 10:30.421
We have confirmed that it is within
the crashed ship, admiral.

10:30.504 --> 10:31.589
Conditions?

10:31.672 --> 10:33.799
Catastrophic outside the vessel.

10:34.383 --> 10:37.345
Inside, however,
there is a breathable atmosphere

10:37.428 --> 10:39.388
with only moderate radiation exposure.

10:39.972 --> 10:42.308
Provided we bring
the appropriate medications,

10:42.391 --> 10:45.811
we can safely beam in
to recover the Kelpien.

10:45.895 --> 10:46.937
We?

10:48.522 --> 10:51.442
I plan to accompany the away team.

10:52.026 --> 10:55.237
While I'm gone, my Number One,
Ensign Tilly, will be in charge.

10:59.742 --> 11:01.744
I have every confidence in her.

11:05.414 --> 11:08.000
You believe this planet
is also the source of the Burn?

11:08.084 --> 11:08.918
[Burnham] Yes, sir.

11:10.336 --> 11:11.462
Is <i>Discovery </i>safe?

11:11.545 --> 11:13.798
Well, it has been 120 years.

11:13.881 --> 11:19.637
Presumably, whatever unique phenomenon
caused the Burn then could repeat now.

11:19.720 --> 11:22.932
But in that case,
distance would not spare us.

11:23.015 --> 11:26.310
Any chance the life sign
might have been somehow involved?

11:26.394 --> 11:29.230
The scientists were members
of the Federation.

11:29.313 --> 11:33.192
And the child would have been,
perhaps, 4 or 5 at the time.

11:33.859 --> 11:34.860
So, no.

11:34.944 --> 11:37.655
There's one thing you should be aware of
before you go.

11:38.697 --> 11:41.409
I had to send part of the fleet
to Kaminar.

11:42.535 --> 11:43.577
Kaminar?

11:43.661 --> 11:45.371
[Vance] Soon after you left,
we received word

11:45.454 --> 11:48.624
that the Chain were conducting
military exercises nearby.

11:48.707 --> 11:50.209
We can jump there immediately.

11:51.168 --> 11:53.295
Remember what Osyraa did to draw Book out.

11:54.505 --> 11:56.006
She attacked Kwejian.

11:56.590 --> 11:59.176
[Vance] We believe she's doing the same
with Kaminar.

11:59.260 --> 12:01.137
Trying to lure <i>Discovery.</i>

12:03.222 --> 12:05.141
She wants our spore drive.

12:07.893 --> 12:12.148
We will take good care of your home.
I promise.

12:13.899 --> 12:15.776
-Thank you, admiral.
-[Vance] Now, go.

12:15.860 --> 12:17.153
Rescue the life sign.

12:17.236 --> 12:19.780
And find out what we need to do
to get that dilithium.

12:19.864 --> 12:20.739
And, captain...

12:22.408 --> 12:23.742
do be careful down there.

12:32.168 --> 12:34.170
-Hello there, lady.
-[cat meowing]

12:36.464 --> 12:37.381
Did you miss me?

12:38.924 --> 12:40.050
[cat purring]

12:40.134 --> 12:40.968
Mm.

12:41.469 --> 12:43.429
Yeah. I know you missed me.

12:43.512 --> 12:44.346
Did I?

12:45.890 --> 12:47.641
How'd his DNA recombination go?

12:47.725 --> 12:48.809
He'll be fine.

12:48.893 --> 12:49.727
I'm always fine.

12:51.061 --> 12:51.896
And Grudge?

12:52.605 --> 12:55.524
Her DNA recombination was also successful.

12:55.608 --> 12:56.650
She's good as new.

12:57.234 --> 13:00.571
Well, on the ship,
she was favoring her front left paw.

13:00.654 --> 13:01.906
Could you check her out?

13:04.074 --> 13:05.618
I'll let you know when she's ready.

13:06.160 --> 13:07.036
[cat meows]

13:08.204 --> 13:09.538
[dramatic music playing]

13:09.622 --> 13:10.789
How's my ship?

13:11.373 --> 13:12.750
DOTS are working on it.

13:12.833 --> 13:13.834
She'll survive.

13:14.460 --> 13:16.545
Glad the autopilot kicked in when it did.

13:16.629 --> 13:17.755
Yeah, me, too.

13:17.838 --> 13:18.964
You see the data?

13:19.715 --> 13:21.383
Hell of a thing, all that dilithium.

13:21.467 --> 13:22.676
Game changer, right?

13:23.177 --> 13:26.263
No more planets stuck out on their own,
held hostage by Osyraa.

13:26.972 --> 13:28.933
The galaxy just got a whole lot smaller.

13:30.809 --> 13:31.852
Hey.

13:33.229 --> 13:34.563
What's on your mind?

13:36.273 --> 13:38.526
I'm going with Saru.

13:39.401 --> 13:40.277
And Culber.

13:41.779 --> 13:43.447
And Saru worries you.

13:44.782 --> 13:46.617
I'm not sure he can be objective.

13:48.494 --> 13:51.038
How he'll handle it
if he has to make a hard call.

13:52.164 --> 13:53.332
A painful one?

13:53.916 --> 13:55.167
One that costs him.

13:57.169 --> 13:59.129
But that's what it means to be a captain.

14:01.382 --> 14:03.217
He's gonna need you down there.

14:05.511 --> 14:10.724
Well, whatever answers we find,
I just hope they're enough.

14:13.018 --> 14:14.103
For all of us.

14:15.938 --> 14:19.358
No, no, no.
The radiation levels are off the charts.

14:19.441 --> 14:21.944
-I know.
-And the odds

14:22.027 --> 14:26.490
of someone surviving for that long
are vanishingly small.

14:26.991 --> 14:28.117
I know that, too.

14:28.617 --> 14:29.702
You can't go, Hugh.

14:30.953 --> 14:33.706
You have me, you have Adira,

14:33.789 --> 14:35.040
and everyone here.

14:35.124 --> 14:36.375
Paul.

14:37.126 --> 14:39.086
[tender music playing]

14:39.169 --> 14:40.462
I need to go for me.

14:42.423 --> 14:43.966
I was so lost...

14:44.675 --> 14:45.885
after I came back.

14:46.468 --> 14:49.638
And ever since we came
to this future, I...

14:51.974 --> 14:54.476
I found a purpose
I didn't even know I was looking for.

14:57.146 --> 14:58.397
I can help Saru.

14:59.440 --> 15:01.191
And if there is a survivor...

15:03.152 --> 15:04.862
they've been alone for decades.

15:06.196 --> 15:08.157
And maybe I can help them, too.

15:10.075 --> 15:12.411
Promise me that you'll be safe.

15:14.288 --> 15:15.998
We'll keep comms open.

15:16.081 --> 15:17.666
You can listen in the whole time.

15:23.005 --> 15:23.839
I gotta go.

15:33.515 --> 15:35.059
Hey. What's up?

15:35.142 --> 15:37.645
We're gonna jump in, like, ten minutes.

15:37.728 --> 15:39.605
Come sit. Before things get crazy.

15:39.688 --> 15:41.690
Oh, things are already crazy.

15:41.774 --> 15:42.733
Fair enough.

15:44.777 --> 15:47.237
I know it's a lot, taking the conn.

15:49.031 --> 15:53.118
First time Georgiou left me in charge,
I don't think I took a deep breath

15:53.202 --> 15:55.621
the entire five hours
and 37 minutes she was gone.

15:57.206 --> 16:00.417
Well, you know, it's like my Granna Adele
always used to say,

16:00.501 --> 16:03.128
until you've flown a starship
into a flaming nebula

16:03.212 --> 16:05.339
and gotten everyone out,
you haven't lived.

16:05.923 --> 16:06.757
So...

16:08.175 --> 16:10.094
-She didn't really say that.
-Right.

16:12.346 --> 16:14.598
Listen, there is a metal burr

16:15.099 --> 16:17.226
under the left armrest
of the captain's chair.

16:17.935 --> 16:20.938
We had one in the same place
on the <i>Shenzhou.</i>

16:21.021 --> 16:23.816
Construction glitch
at the San Francisco Fleet Yards.

16:24.566 --> 16:27.319
Whenever Georgiou got
into a tricky situation,

16:28.529 --> 16:32.074
she felt like all the different choices
were mind-numbing...

16:33.033 --> 16:35.077
she would press on it with her thumb.

16:36.620 --> 16:38.163
To kind of stay in the moment.

16:38.247 --> 16:39.123
You know?

16:39.665 --> 16:41.417
[dramatic music playing]

16:41.500 --> 16:43.794
And first time she made me acting captain,

16:44.420 --> 16:46.797
when I sat down,
I immediately felt for it.

16:48.048 --> 16:52.136
But all that was there
was this little shiny spot,

16:52.219 --> 16:54.722
where she had rubbed that burr
into a dent.

16:56.724 --> 16:59.810
And I've seen Saru touch the one here
on <i>Discovery.</i>

17:02.104 --> 17:06.442
So, burr, dent, shiny spot, whatever,

17:07.609 --> 17:08.944
it's there for you.

17:14.199 --> 17:15.951
You belong in that chair, Tilly.

17:23.000 --> 17:23.834
Thank you.

17:25.794 --> 17:28.255
Hey, keep an eye
on those radiation levels, okay?

17:28.338 --> 17:30.507
-I need you all to come back one piece.
-Aye, captain.

17:30.591 --> 17:31.425
Oh.

17:31.508 --> 17:34.053
[man over PA]
<i>Ensign Tilly, please report to the bridge.</i>

17:34.470 --> 17:35.512
[whimpers]

17:36.013 --> 17:37.056
[breathes deeply]

17:37.139 --> 17:39.475
Okay. Here we go.

17:47.066 --> 17:49.026
[explosion, then thunder rumbling]

17:49.109 --> 17:52.154
-[Saru] Status report.
-Shields dropping as expected, sir.

17:52.237 --> 17:55.032
Ship's holding steady in the pocket.
Nice find, Book.

17:55.115 --> 17:57.117
Coordinates for the <i>Khi'eth </i>are locked in.

17:57.201 --> 17:58.452
Sending to your badges now.

17:58.535 --> 18:00.913
-Dr. Culber.
-Radiation levels on the <i>Khi'eth</i>

18:00.996 --> 18:04.166
are lower than on the rest of the planet
but still too high for us.

18:04.249 --> 18:07.878
So, keep an eye on your radiation levels.
The meds we've just taken will help

18:07.961 --> 18:11.131
as will the anti-radiation boosters
that we're bringing with us.

18:11.215 --> 18:15.260
But we'll still need to be back in sickbay
in four hours, at the most.

18:15.344 --> 18:17.262
Shields will be repaired
in three hours.

18:17.346 --> 18:19.139
Soon as they're ready, we'll jump back

18:19.223 --> 18:21.683
-to get you and the life sign.
-Shields 35 percent...

18:21.767 --> 18:23.102
-Thirty.
-Captain.

18:23.185 --> 18:24.228
It is time.

18:25.646 --> 18:27.606
[dramatic music playing]

18:33.070 --> 18:35.781
Number One, you have the conn.

19:02.766 --> 19:03.600
Black alert.

19:12.609 --> 19:13.861
[whirring]

19:17.573 --> 19:18.615
What the...?

19:18.699 --> 19:20.701
[dramatic music playing]

19:21.493 --> 19:22.870
[whirring]

19:25.414 --> 19:26.248
Culber?

19:30.502 --> 19:31.336
Culber...

19:32.588 --> 19:33.589
You're Bajoran.

19:34.965 --> 19:36.008
[gasps]

19:37.092 --> 19:38.093
You're Trill.

19:38.302 --> 19:40.637
-[gasps]
-What the hell is going on?

19:41.638 --> 19:43.599
Where's Saru? Saru?

19:46.643 --> 19:48.437
[Saru] My heel is touching the ground.

19:54.484 --> 19:55.777
You're human.

20:00.032 --> 20:01.116
What is happening?

20:12.419 --> 20:13.879
[Burnham] Where are we?

20:13.962 --> 20:17.549
If we beamed directly to the planet,
we'd be dying right about now.

20:18.300 --> 20:19.843
Gruesomely, I might add, so...

20:19.927 --> 20:21.261
So, we are on the ship.

20:22.346 --> 20:24.264
<i>Discovery. </i>Come in, <i>Discovery.</i>

20:26.058 --> 20:26.934
We have no badge.

20:27.476 --> 20:29.228
No Phaser or Tricorder either.

20:30.062 --> 20:31.271
Our supplies.

20:31.355 --> 20:33.315
We need those radiation meds.

20:34.566 --> 20:39.154
We must be in some kind of advanced
holo-program.

20:39.238 --> 20:43.325
It is possible that our supplies
are being simply masked by the program.

20:43.408 --> 20:45.244
Computer, exit program.

20:48.205 --> 20:49.581
[in alien language] Exit program.

20:49.665 --> 20:51.917
Emergency. End program.

20:53.502 --> 20:55.545
[in English] I suppose
that was too much to hope for.

20:55.629 --> 20:57.422
You think <i>Discovery </i>can still hear us?

20:58.048 --> 20:59.800
Guess there's no way to tell for sure.

20:59.883 --> 21:02.177
At what point should we worry
about our health?

21:02.261 --> 21:04.721
Well, as long as the ship returns
as scheduled,

21:05.806 --> 21:09.101
we'll be sick, but we'll live.

21:09.184 --> 21:11.353
[Burnham] Four hours. Clock starts now.

21:11.436 --> 21:12.980
[Saru] We should not waste any time.

21:13.063 --> 21:15.691
Locate the source of the life sign
as quickly as possible.

21:15.774 --> 21:17.567
[woman] ...as you may remember
from our lesson,

21:17.651 --> 21:19.653
a replicator takes subatomic particles

21:19.736 --> 21:21.780
and turns them
into the component molecules

21:21.863 --> 21:23.073
of the food or object.

21:23.156 --> 21:26.285
And then forms the food or object
from those molecules.

21:26.368 --> 21:31.081
Like a peanut butter sandwich,
hasperat or sautéed-- Sautéed algae.

21:31.748 --> 21:34.251
-Greetings.
-When the replicator goes down,

21:34.334 --> 21:36.128
you'll need a submicron scanner.

21:36.211 --> 21:39.214
A submicron scanner like this
to get inside the panel.

21:39.298 --> 21:42.134
We are here in response
to a Federation distress call.

21:42.217 --> 21:44.678
You are in the wrong program.

21:44.761 --> 21:46.805
Go to History and Current Events.

21:46.888 --> 21:49.099
The computer sees us
as part of the program.

21:49.182 --> 21:50.892
That must be why we look like this.

21:50.976 --> 21:52.936
What is the purpose
of this environment?

21:53.020 --> 21:57.316
Its purpose-- Purpose--
Purpose is training.

21:57.399 --> 22:00.319
Its purpose-- Purpose-- Purpose--

22:00.402 --> 22:01.653
Program malfunction.

22:03.363 --> 22:04.489
Poor thing.

22:04.573 --> 22:06.450
A hundred and twenty-five years
of radiation.

22:06.533 --> 22:08.660
I'm surprised
it hasn't broken down further.

22:08.744 --> 22:10.829
[Culber] Imagine what it's done
to the life sign.

22:10.912 --> 22:12.914
[Saru] We have to find it somehow.

22:13.832 --> 22:16.626
[Burnham] Maybe that holo led us over here
for a reason.

22:19.796 --> 22:21.465
[Saru] We should proceed carefully.

22:21.548 --> 22:24.468
The rest of this training program
may not be so innocuous.

22:36.813 --> 22:38.815
[clattering]

22:41.151 --> 22:42.527
[Culber] Oh, my.

22:45.113 --> 22:47.074
The holo's changed our clothing again.

22:49.284 --> 22:51.787
Do human bodies respond negatively
to heights?

22:51.870 --> 22:53.705
My heart seems to be racing.

22:53.789 --> 22:56.625
-Yeah, that makes two of us.
-Looks like an ancient stepwell.

22:57.793 --> 23:00.921
A lot of pre-warp civilizations
used them for irrigation.

23:02.047 --> 23:03.632
The holo's damaged there, too.

23:04.299 --> 23:05.509
We have to be careful.

23:07.219 --> 23:09.221
[thunder crashing and rumbling]

23:24.194 --> 23:25.320
Look at that.

23:26.238 --> 23:28.365
Looks like no one wants that door to open.

23:31.118 --> 23:33.245
These appear to be a ritual of some kind.

23:34.412 --> 23:36.915
I'm gonna take a wild guess
and say it's for protection.

23:37.457 --> 23:38.792
The shape is...

23:39.501 --> 23:40.752
vaguely familiar.

23:41.753 --> 23:43.588
[man singing in foreign language]

23:46.258 --> 23:48.093
Maybe the holo can tell us where we are.

23:51.888 --> 23:53.098
Excuse me.

23:55.267 --> 23:56.101
Hello?

23:56.810 --> 23:59.604
What are you doing here?
You don't belong here.

23:59.688 --> 24:01.690
[dramatic music playing]

24:05.485 --> 24:06.903
What program are you from?

24:07.696 --> 24:11.324
Um, I realize that our appearance
might be confusing to you.

24:11.408 --> 24:12.993
We are not from any program.

24:13.243 --> 24:15.245
[banging]

24:17.706 --> 24:18.665
I don't understand.

24:18.748 --> 24:20.250
[Saru] I am Saru.

24:20.333 --> 24:22.836
This is Michael and Hugh.

24:23.378 --> 24:25.964
We are so relieved to find you.

24:26.047 --> 24:29.217
We came in response to-- I believe
it was your mother's distress call.

24:29.301 --> 24:30.677
-[banging continues]
-[Saru gasps]

24:32.137 --> 24:33.555
Where are you from?

24:34.264 --> 24:35.765
We are from outside.

24:35.849 --> 24:37.100
Outside the program.

24:37.726 --> 24:39.436
Outside?

24:43.273 --> 24:46.109
You woke the monster. [whimpers]

24:48.737 --> 24:50.030
-Wait.
-Captain.

24:51.156 --> 24:52.991
Those doors unlocked from the outside

24:53.617 --> 24:57.537
-the moment he got scared.
-[monster growling]

24:58.371 --> 25:00.540
We only scanned one life sign down here.

25:01.124 --> 25:04.294
So, whatever's in that room,
whatever its emotional connection to him,

25:04.377 --> 25:07.589
-it still has to be a holo.
-Unless it leaves that room

25:07.672 --> 25:09.591
and threatens us,
it is not our priority.

25:09.674 --> 25:11.551
-We're wasting time.
-Wait.

25:11.635 --> 25:15.013
What if the survivor doesn't know
the outside world even exists?

25:15.096 --> 25:18.683
What if he's never heard of the Burn?
Or doesn't even know he's on a planet?

25:18.767 --> 25:21.144
Think about it.
If all he knows is this program,

25:22.020 --> 25:23.939
we're basically dealing with a child.

25:24.522 --> 25:28.193
She's right. We should be careful.
Emotionally, he's likely to be fragile.

25:29.110 --> 25:31.404
We should go slowly,
treat this as first contact.

25:32.280 --> 25:33.615
Yes. Of course.

25:34.282 --> 25:35.659
You two should go find him.

25:36.993 --> 25:39.829
I'll stay and make sure
whatever's in there stays in there.

25:41.665 --> 25:42.707
Yeah.

25:51.466 --> 25:54.135
[Stamets] We need shields up and running
to get back into the nebula.

25:54.219 --> 25:56.721
Reroute all additional power
from backup systems.

25:56.805 --> 25:58.390
And hurry. They're on a clock.

25:58.473 --> 26:01.309
Three shield generators
are too damaged to take the charge.

26:01.393 --> 26:02.852
[Gray] Someone check structural integrity?

26:02.936 --> 26:05.313
-[Adira] Of course.
-[Stamets] Boost comms, please.

26:05.397 --> 26:07.816
[Burnham over comms]
<i>If you can hear us, we've found something.</i>

26:08.984 --> 26:10.402
[monster growling over comms]

26:11.027 --> 26:11.903
What was that?

26:13.363 --> 26:14.406
[Stamets] Captain Saru?

26:14.489 --> 26:17.659
Commander Burnham, this is <i>Discovery.</i>

26:17.742 --> 26:18.910
Pease respond.

26:19.369 --> 26:20.578
[growling continues]

26:20.662 --> 26:21.496
Hugh?

26:22.580 --> 26:24.374
<i>Bridge, are you monitoring comms?</i>

26:24.457 --> 26:25.625
We heard it, commander.

26:25.709 --> 26:27.085
<i>We need to bring them home.</i>

26:27.168 --> 26:29.838
We can't jump back in the nebula
without full shields. Owo?

26:29.921 --> 26:31.172
Only at 40 percent.

26:32.215 --> 26:34.050
Stamets, take all the power you need.

26:34.134 --> 26:38.013
Captain? Long-range sensors
have picked up a ship approaching.

26:38.096 --> 26:40.557
[suspenseful music playing]

26:40.640 --> 26:41.766
It's Federation.

26:43.601 --> 26:45.562
Shouldn't be any Federation ships here.

26:45.645 --> 26:48.106
Unless they've been stranded
since the Burn.

26:48.189 --> 26:51.901
This is not the place I'd wanna stay
for 125 years.

26:53.653 --> 26:54.779
Hail them.

26:55.280 --> 26:56.489
[signal beeping]

26:56.573 --> 27:00.035
They're not answering.
But they sent the correct response codes.

27:00.118 --> 27:01.578
They're ten minutes out.

27:07.125 --> 27:09.461
[male voice]
The Federation is honored to welcome

27:09.544 --> 27:12.297
-The Kelpien Ba'ul Alliance
-[Culber] What's this?

27:12.380 --> 27:16.092
[male voice] as the newest members
of the United Federation of Planets.

27:16.176 --> 27:19.054
-Your reconciliation...
-It's the day Kaminar officially joined

27:19.137 --> 27:20.221
-the Federation.
-Yeah.

27:20.722 --> 27:22.724
The first holo led us inside.

27:22.807 --> 27:24.976
Perhaps these can help us find
the survivor.

27:25.060 --> 27:27.187
I'll ask. Excuse me.

27:29.272 --> 27:30.106
Hello.

27:31.024 --> 27:33.568
You are anticipated input.

27:33.651 --> 27:35.153
Classification, rescuer.

27:35.236 --> 27:37.614
If true, skip, skip, skip.

27:37.697 --> 27:38.531
Process emotion.

27:38.615 --> 27:40.075
Ecstatic gratitude.

27:41.242 --> 27:43.203
[crowd applauding]

27:44.662 --> 27:46.081
What did we just do?

27:46.498 --> 27:48.375
I'm so pleased you have finally come.

27:48.875 --> 27:52.045
You are anticipated input. Yes or no.

27:52.754 --> 27:55.340
May I ask? Anticipated input?

27:55.924 --> 27:57.592
You are rescuers, are you not?

27:58.218 --> 27:59.886
The child has been waiting for...

27:59.969 --> 28:01.554
Cache database.

28:01.638 --> 28:04.682
...125 years, three months,
17 days, four hours.

28:04.766 --> 28:07.394
How did you keep him alive
for 125 years?

28:08.186 --> 28:11.689
Executed protocols include
life support, education,

28:11.773 --> 28:13.983
preparation for arrival
of anticipated input.

28:14.067 --> 28:15.360
Does he have a name?

28:17.237 --> 28:19.447
How has he survived the radiation here?

28:19.531 --> 28:22.700
Does he take medicine, were his genes
epigenetically altered in utero?

28:22.784 --> 28:25.286
[in high-pitched voice]
Cue three, one, two, one.

28:25.912 --> 28:29.249
[in normal voice] My friends, the child
may be frightened of your true appearance.

28:29.332 --> 28:31.751
You will be the first sentient beings
he's encountered

28:31.835 --> 28:35.380
since the program was initiated.
Your appearance has been altered

28:35.463 --> 28:37.090
to be consistent with the program.

28:37.173 --> 28:40.510
Repeat query.
Are you the anticipated input?

28:40.593 --> 28:43.722
If no, then initiate defense protocols.

28:43.805 --> 28:45.348
Yes, we are the anticipated input.

28:45.432 --> 28:47.183
We have come to rescue the child.

28:47.600 --> 28:48.768
[crowd applauding]

28:51.521 --> 28:53.106
Now, please, where is he?

28:54.441 --> 28:56.443
[dramatic music playing]

29:08.371 --> 29:09.581
[whooshing]

29:17.672 --> 29:19.007
[monster growling]

29:21.384 --> 29:22.927
[suspenseful music playing]

29:28.016 --> 29:29.726
[Burnham gasps]

29:57.253 --> 29:58.338
I'm Michael.

30:00.089 --> 30:01.132
What are you?

30:03.051 --> 30:05.053
Are you a part of the program?

30:20.735 --> 30:22.737
[screeching]

30:23.905 --> 30:25.824
Wait. Wait!

30:33.373 --> 30:35.124
[Burnham gasps]

30:51.975 --> 30:54.435
[screams]

30:55.812 --> 30:58.439
[gasps, then screaming]

30:59.524 --> 31:01.442
Unknown vessel in range
in two minutes.

31:01.526 --> 31:04.112
Why didn't we notice its signature
when we jumped in?

31:04.195 --> 31:06.030
Could be interference from the nebula.

31:08.241 --> 31:11.870
Are there any M-Class planets
within five light-years of this location?

31:12.537 --> 31:13.413
[Owo] None, captain.

31:13.496 --> 31:15.790
I'd have set a course for a new home
ages ago.

31:15.874 --> 31:17.125
Me, too.

31:17.208 --> 31:19.460
Owo, scan again, but don't scan the ship.

31:19.544 --> 31:21.796
Scan the area around the ship.

31:21.880 --> 31:24.299
Neutrino emissions around the ship
are off the charts.

31:24.382 --> 31:25.884
They make no sense.

31:27.427 --> 31:29.596
That's because that's not
a Federation ship.

31:30.138 --> 31:33.349
We have a spore drive and we're right next
to a dilithium planet.

31:33.433 --> 31:35.768
There's one person
who wants both of those enough

31:35.852 --> 31:37.395
to come all the way out here.

31:38.354 --> 31:40.982
[suspenseful music playing]

31:41.065 --> 31:42.191
Red alert! Shields up!

31:42.275 --> 31:45.028
-Osyraa's coming in, weapons hot.
-Ready photon torpedoes.

31:45.111 --> 31:46.529
[Detmer] How did she even get here?

31:46.613 --> 31:48.406
Transwarp tunnel on the courier maps.

31:48.489 --> 31:50.491
But nobody in their right mind
would use it.

31:50.575 --> 31:52.118
-[Detmer] Should we jump away?
-We can't.

31:52.201 --> 31:54.287
We have to stay
to protect the away team.

31:54.370 --> 31:55.788
[Owo] She's scanning us.

31:57.290 --> 31:59.459
We have the ability to cloak
since the retrofit?

31:59.542 --> 32:02.295
Yes, but we can't jump while cloaked.
If anything happens--

32:02.378 --> 32:04.088
One crisis at a time. Do it.

32:11.304 --> 32:12.847
What do you wanna do now, captain?

32:12.931 --> 32:14.933
[dramatic music playing]

32:24.150 --> 32:25.860
[Burnham gasps]

32:28.404 --> 32:29.489
[groans]

32:41.209 --> 32:44.170
You are a program, are you not?

32:48.424 --> 32:50.635
Yes, I am a program.

32:50.718 --> 32:52.512
I knew it. Which one?

32:52.595 --> 32:53.680
Let me guess.

32:54.597 --> 32:57.392
Combat? Um, survival skills?

32:57.475 --> 32:59.978
I've done the others so many times.

33:00.812 --> 33:03.272
I did not think
I would find something new.

33:06.025 --> 33:07.235
I am teaching...

33:09.320 --> 33:12.073
the dynamics of social interaction.

33:14.283 --> 33:15.284
Why?

33:16.077 --> 33:20.373
For sentient beings, connection to others
is incredibly important.

33:20.456 --> 33:22.125
It helps sustain them.

33:22.625 --> 33:24.544
Like my connection to the holos.

33:24.627 --> 33:25.503
Exactly.

33:26.129 --> 33:29.674
And this can prepare you for when you talk
to someone else one of these days.

33:29.757 --> 33:30.633
Someone...

33:31.509 --> 33:32.635
unexpected.

33:33.636 --> 33:38.891
The other holo, the human,
was he also part of your program?

33:39.892 --> 33:40.852
Why do you ask?

33:40.935 --> 33:42.562
He was unexpected.

33:43.187 --> 33:45.648
He said he was from Outside.

33:46.733 --> 33:49.694
I have not heard that teaching
in a long time.

33:50.653 --> 33:51.863
How long has it been?

33:52.405 --> 33:53.322
Uh...

33:53.614 --> 33:57.076
There used to be lots of holos
that talked about Outside.

33:57.702 --> 33:59.704
But the Outside never came inside.

34:00.288 --> 34:02.790
Probably the Outside is dead by now.

34:04.000 --> 34:07.795
Well, I was also programmed
to help you understand what is outside.

34:08.379 --> 34:11.090
I'm sorry to have to tell you
you are obsolete.

34:12.467 --> 34:15.845
Then I suppose I should deactivate?
If you don't want a new connection.

34:15.928 --> 34:17.305
No. No, wait.

34:18.139 --> 34:20.099
We can still run the program.

34:21.350 --> 34:24.520
It's been a long time
since I've encountered a new program.

34:25.396 --> 34:26.230
All right.

34:26.814 --> 34:28.107
Let's talk about...

34:29.484 --> 34:31.110
social units.

34:34.447 --> 34:35.531
[Saru] Hello?

34:37.200 --> 34:38.451
Can anyone hear us?

34:39.077 --> 34:40.161
[Culber] He must be in here.

34:43.998 --> 34:45.750
[dramatic music playing]

34:45.833 --> 34:49.629
That is an elder. When I was a boy,

34:50.213 --> 34:53.174
the village elders
would gather around the fire with us

34:53.257 --> 34:55.218
at night and tell stories.

34:55.301 --> 34:57.720
It was how we preserved our history.

34:59.222 --> 35:01.516
But they never survived to this age.

35:02.767 --> 35:05.144
So, this is the oldest Kelpien
you've ever seen?

35:07.146 --> 35:08.689
I know it is not real, but...

35:10.149 --> 35:10.983
yes.

35:11.776 --> 35:14.112
[Culber]
Hopefully he knows where the survivor is.

35:17.365 --> 35:19.158
Captain, look at this.

35:26.874 --> 35:28.334
[Saru] Su'Kal.

35:29.168 --> 35:30.169
That is his name.

35:30.795 --> 35:32.463
Does it have any significance?

35:32.547 --> 35:37.593
Well, it does not directly translate, but
it means something like "beloved gift."

35:38.469 --> 35:40.179
It is a tradition in Kelpien families

35:40.263 --> 35:42.723
that after you have suffered
a great tragedy,

35:42.807 --> 35:46.686
the next child born in your family
is named Su'Kal.

35:48.604 --> 35:52.191
The child symbolizes the end of suffering.

35:59.240 --> 36:01.701
Honored elder, excuse me.

36:02.952 --> 36:03.911
Hello.

36:05.121 --> 36:06.747
Would you like a story?

36:07.456 --> 36:09.250
No, elder, thank you.

36:10.376 --> 36:12.211
We are looking for Su'Kal.

36:12.712 --> 36:14.088
Do you know where he might be?

36:14.755 --> 36:19.719
I am programmed to teach Kelpien
and Ba'ul history and traditions,

36:19.802 --> 36:23.389
and to provide
social and emotional support

36:23.472 --> 36:25.141
for the growing child.

36:25.892 --> 36:27.602
Can you tell us who created you?

36:27.685 --> 36:30.855
Why, his mother, of course.

36:31.647 --> 36:33.357
We are all from her.

36:35.443 --> 36:36.569
Dr. lssa.

36:37.528 --> 36:39.280
She knew she was dying,

36:40.281 --> 36:44.827
that they were all dying,
and that Su'Kal would survive.

36:45.745 --> 36:46.954
That's what this is.

36:48.289 --> 36:49.457
A whole world

36:50.374 --> 36:54.086
created to raise her son and protect him
until somebody came to rescue him.

36:55.004 --> 36:59.467
To know that she was leaving her child,
it must have been heartbreaking.

37:01.052 --> 37:02.178
Every moment.

37:03.763 --> 37:06.349
[Burnham] <i>Tell me</i>
<i>what you know about families.</i>

37:07.016 --> 37:09.560
[Su'Kal] Families are where children
are nurtured and loved,

37:10.144 --> 37:14.106
and taught the norms and rules
of the society in which they are raised.

37:15.691 --> 37:17.652
Do you remember your family?

37:19.278 --> 37:20.821
We played together.

37:22.323 --> 37:24.033
Harvested kelp. I liked that.

37:24.116 --> 37:26.410
I liked being in the water.

37:26.494 --> 37:28.371
I liked the way it smelled.

37:29.705 --> 37:30.665
I had a...

37:33.751 --> 37:35.044
We ate together.

37:37.838 --> 37:39.340
Those are family things.

37:40.007 --> 37:41.175
It was a long time ago.

37:41.259 --> 37:43.886
The harvesting environment
is no longer functional.

37:46.222 --> 37:49.767
Do you remember anything
before all of this?

37:52.144 --> 37:53.229
Before?

37:55.314 --> 37:58.150
I wonder if you might remember
a time with your family

37:58.693 --> 38:00.403
before the harvesting environment.

38:02.863 --> 38:05.032
When you were on a ship, perhaps?

38:09.328 --> 38:11.247
Computer, reset parameters.

38:19.088 --> 38:19.922
Hello.

38:20.006 --> 38:21.173
Hello.

38:22.425 --> 38:23.676
You're here to teach me.

38:24.635 --> 38:25.553
Yes.

38:27.555 --> 38:29.724
Forgive me. My programming is unstable.

38:30.683 --> 38:31.934
Where is the exit?

38:33.686 --> 38:35.229
I don't understand.

38:36.022 --> 38:37.231
There is always an exit.

38:38.316 --> 38:40.443
A way to turn off the holo program.

38:40.943 --> 38:42.778
To reset all parameters.

38:42.862 --> 38:44.405
No, no, no.

38:44.488 --> 38:45.323
No, stop it.

38:46.407 --> 38:47.742
Why would you do that?

38:48.701 --> 38:50.328
I do not like this program.

38:50.411 --> 38:52.413
[dramatic music playing]

39:12.308 --> 39:15.770
I know this is meaningful for you,
but we can't stay here, captain.

39:16.479 --> 39:20.066
We need to finish the mission, find
Commander Burnham and get out of here.

39:21.650 --> 39:22.485
Elder...

39:23.569 --> 39:26.405
we understand the nature
of your programming,

39:26.489 --> 39:29.617
but in order to provide
social and emotional support

39:29.700 --> 39:32.787
for the growing child, we must locate him.

39:35.039 --> 39:40.044
When he is afraid,
he goes to his fortress.

39:41.087 --> 39:44.340
The child hides away from all of us.

39:45.257 --> 39:46.342
I'll try to find him.

39:50.096 --> 39:51.430
May I examine the book?

39:51.514 --> 39:53.099
Oh, yes.

39:57.353 --> 39:58.938
Would you like a lullaby?

40:01.774 --> 40:02.608
Yeah.

40:04.902 --> 40:06.904
[singing in Kelpien]

40:06.987 --> 40:08.989
[tender music playing]

40:38.436 --> 40:41.397
[Saru] This totem.
I saw these near the entrance.

40:43.649 --> 40:46.986
The All-Seeing Eye has become protection?

40:48.779 --> 40:49.613
Um...

40:50.489 --> 40:54.410
Su'Kal, he uses this design
to build these totems.

40:54.493 --> 40:56.787
What is he protecting himself from?

40:56.871 --> 40:59.081
The monster from the story.

40:59.165 --> 41:02.960
It rises from the sea, covered in kelp

41:03.836 --> 41:05.754
to remind the children of Kaminar

41:05.838 --> 41:07.715
that to be truly free--

41:07.798 --> 41:10.009
They must face their deepest fear.

41:10.092 --> 41:11.552
I remember that story.

41:11.635 --> 41:12.595
Yes.

41:13.888 --> 41:16.640
Su'Kal is afraid
of whatever is behind that locked door.

41:17.266 --> 41:21.270
So long as he will not face it,
he will remain in this place.

41:22.688 --> 41:23.856
As will you.

41:26.108 --> 41:28.110
[thunder rumbling]

41:29.570 --> 41:30.404
Oh, no.

41:31.238 --> 41:34.366
<i>Discovery?</i> If you're listening, Paul?

41:34.450 --> 41:37.119
Hurry back. We need you.

41:37.786 --> 41:39.788
[dramatic music playing]

41:56.263 --> 41:57.389
Any sign of Osyraa?

41:57.473 --> 41:58.557
Nothing.

41:58.641 --> 42:00.643
[Tilly] How did she even find us?

42:00.726 --> 42:03.395
[Book] If she wants your spore drive,
she's been tracking it.

42:03.479 --> 42:05.356
[Detmer] Scanning for our jump signature?

42:05.439 --> 42:07.566
[Book] She'd have gotten a read on it
back at Kwejian.

42:07.650 --> 42:09.360
Why didn't she fire on us?

42:09.443 --> 42:11.820
It's not like her.
Whatever she's got planned,

42:11.904 --> 42:14.740
I'm guessing she'll need us whole
to make it work.

42:16.283 --> 42:18.327
Engineering, what's the status on shields?

42:18.410 --> 42:20.079
[Stamets]
<i>Thirty minutes before we can jump.</i>

42:20.162 --> 42:23.541
-[signal beeping]
-We're being hailed. It's Osyraa.

42:24.875 --> 42:26.710
Tell Stamets we need shields in ten.

42:27.211 --> 42:28.045
Put her through.

42:29.338 --> 42:30.214
On-screen.

42:36.053 --> 42:37.388
<i>Where is the captain?</i>

42:37.471 --> 42:40.015
-I'm acting captain.
-[laughs]

42:40.432 --> 42:43.102
<i>The Kelpien left you in charge?</i>

42:43.185 --> 42:44.395
Damn straight. Mm.

42:44.478 --> 42:47.106
Kind of busy right now,
so could you get to the point?

42:47.731 --> 42:51.277
<i>You are not really captain material.</i>

42:52.278 --> 42:53.654
Oh, nice try.

42:53.737 --> 42:55.406
You don't know anything about me.

42:55.489 --> 42:57.116
<i>Oh, sure I do.</i>

42:57.616 --> 42:59.410
<i>Everybody's friend, right?</i>

42:59.493 --> 43:02.371
<i>Good with people, team player.</i>

43:02.454 --> 43:05.249
<i>But deep down</i>
<i>in that pretty little heart of yours,</i>

43:05.332 --> 43:07.084
<i>you know that you're just a fraud.</i>

43:07.626 --> 43:09.920
<i>-How am I doing?</i>
-Mm.

43:10.004 --> 43:13.299
A certain 19th-century Earth neurologist
would say

43:13.382 --> 43:16.093
that you've just proven
the idea of projection.

43:16.677 --> 43:18.012
You tell me I'm a fraud

43:18.095 --> 43:21.807
because deep down inside
you kind of feel like a fraud.

43:22.391 --> 43:25.269
It's interesting, it's not just
a human defense mechanism.

43:25.352 --> 43:26.687
It's galactic.

43:28.105 --> 43:29.815
<i>Don't test me, Red.</i>

43:29.898 --> 43:31.609
Okay. Let's skip Freud.

43:31.692 --> 43:32.860
What do you want?

43:33.402 --> 43:34.820
<i>Your ship,</i>

43:34.903 --> 43:39.867
<i>your spore drive</i>
<i>and your crew as leverage.</i>

43:39.950 --> 43:40.909
[dramatic music playing]

43:40.993 --> 43:42.369
Oh, no.

43:42.870 --> 43:43.954
Not gonna happen.

43:44.038 --> 43:47.291
You will not take this ship
or anyone on it.

43:47.374 --> 43:49.543
Not now, not ever.

43:50.294 --> 43:51.128
No.

43:58.719 --> 44:00.721
[Su'Kal humming]

44:09.688 --> 44:11.690
[monster growling]

44:21.825 --> 44:22.701
[whispers] Michael.

44:27.373 --> 44:29.792
[monster] See me.

44:31.293 --> 44:34.963
[Saru] That holo,
it is the monster from Su'Kal's story.

44:36.006 --> 44:37.257
[whimpering]

44:37.341 --> 44:38.592
[monster] See me.

44:38.676 --> 44:40.969
No! No! No!

44:42.805 --> 44:44.807
[Su'Kal shrieking]

44:46.725 --> 44:48.727
[dramatic music playing]

44:50.270 --> 44:52.564
-[Bryce] Uh, captain.
-[computer beeping]

44:53.107 --> 44:55.359
There's some kind
of disturbance from the surface.

44:55.442 --> 44:56.860
And it's increasing.

44:56.944 --> 44:59.822
The warp core.
Lock down the magnetic constrictors.

44:59.905 --> 45:03.200
-What do you think I'm doing?
-Adira, purge the dilithium chamber.

45:03.283 --> 45:04.618
[Tilly] <i>Stamets, what's happening?</i>

45:04.701 --> 45:07.329
Something is destabilizing
the dilithium in the core.

45:07.413 --> 45:10.541
It'll cause a chain reaction.
I have to reroute all power.

45:10.624 --> 45:12.084
-[computer beeps]
-We're de-cloaking.

45:12.167 --> 45:14.837
If it's happening to us,
it's happening to her, too.

45:14.920 --> 45:16.922
[suspenseful music playing]

45:18.215 --> 45:19.383
[Owo] She's got weapons locked.

45:19.466 --> 45:22.177
-[Detmer] We're not ready to jump.
-Prepare to fire!

45:26.223 --> 45:28.225
[dramatic music playing]

45:30.644 --> 45:31.520
Weapons ready.

45:31.603 --> 45:32.980
Shields at 54 percent.

45:33.063 --> 45:34.481
Stamets, get in the spore cube.

45:34.565 --> 45:35.482
What?

45:35.566 --> 45:38.735
<i>-You've gotta be kidding.</i>
-I will not let Osyraa take this ship.

45:38.819 --> 45:40.946
No! We can't leave them!

45:41.029 --> 45:43.323
[Tilly] <i>I will come back for them,</i>
<i>I promise you, Paul.</i>

45:43.407 --> 45:44.533
I'll get them.

45:44.616 --> 45:46.034
Right now. I'll take my ship.

45:46.952 --> 45:48.162
Bring them back safely.

45:48.245 --> 45:50.205
-[Stamets] <i>Book?</i>
-I got them, don't you worry.

45:50.289 --> 45:52.374
-Go to the spore cube, now.
-Lieutenant Bryce.

45:53.250 --> 45:54.501
[whirring]

45:59.798 --> 46:01.800
[Adira] Hugh will die down there.
They all will.

46:01.884 --> 46:03.886
I have an idea, but I need your badge.

46:05.804 --> 46:07.389
[Stamets] Ready to jump on your mark.

46:09.600 --> 46:11.143
[Su'Kal] No! No!

46:14.563 --> 46:16.482
-[monster hissing]
-No!

46:16.773 --> 46:19.526
[singing in Kelpien]

46:34.541 --> 46:36.543
[dramatic music playing]

47:09.785 --> 47:12.204
[growls]

47:14.581 --> 47:18.293
Captain, the disruption from the planet
has stopped, and we're being hailed again.

47:18.877 --> 47:20.963
Owo, tell me
the second Book's ship's clear.

47:21.046 --> 47:21.880
Put her through.

47:23.507 --> 47:25.008
[sighs] <i>I found you.</i>

47:25.092 --> 47:27.094
We found each other.

47:27.177 --> 47:29.846
<i>You do realize</i>
<i>that I have bigger torpedoes.</i>

47:29.930 --> 47:31.473
And an ever bigger ego.

47:31.557 --> 47:33.684
But don't forget, last time we ran you off

47:33.767 --> 47:35.894
with just our itty-bitty
little scout ship.

47:35.978 --> 47:38.939
<i>What your ship exploited</i>
<i>was a structural anomaly.</i>

47:39.022 --> 47:41.525
<i>And I assure you it's been fixed.</i>

47:41.608 --> 47:44.736
Well, we can fire on each other all day
if that's your thing,

47:44.820 --> 47:46.989
but in the end,
I will self-destruct <i>Discovery</i>

47:47.072 --> 47:49.741
before I let you have her spore drive.

47:49.825 --> 47:51.285
Just to be clear.

47:52.411 --> 47:55.414
<i>You know, I've been asking myself,</i>

47:55.497 --> 47:58.250
<i>why are you not just jumping away?</i>

47:58.875 --> 48:01.753
<i>What is it that you're protecting</i>
<i>out there in the nebula?</i>

48:02.337 --> 48:03.213
<i>Or who?</i>

48:04.089 --> 48:05.465
<i>I wonder.</i>

48:05.549 --> 48:07.259
<i>Is your captain out there?</i>

48:07.926 --> 48:09.928
[dramatic music playing]

48:10.470 --> 48:12.014
-He's clear.
-Black alert.

48:14.933 --> 48:16.018
No. [grunts]

48:20.397 --> 48:22.357
[Tilly] Stamets,
why aren't we jumping away?

48:33.410 --> 48:35.245
[rumbling]

48:35.329 --> 48:37.414
[shouting indistinctly]

48:41.752 --> 48:42.586
Paul?

48:51.511 --> 48:52.804
Michael? If you can hear,

48:52.888 --> 48:54.097
-<i>I'm in the nebula.</i>
-Book?

48:54.181 --> 48:56.767
Whatever just happened,
you can't let it happen again.

48:56.850 --> 48:58.810
It nearly caused another Burn.

49:00.270 --> 49:01.396
Su'Kal.

49:02.147 --> 49:04.149
[dramatic music playing]

49:05.233 --> 49:07.027
He caused the Burn.

49:09.446 --> 49:10.614
How?

49:11.198 --> 49:12.324
[Culber] Bodies adapt.

49:12.949 --> 49:16.370
All this dilithium and subspace radiation.

49:16.453 --> 49:19.623
His cells acclimatized to it in utero
as they divided.

49:19.706 --> 49:21.291
[Burnham] But he was only a child.

49:21.375 --> 49:23.794
[Culber] Then something must have happened
to trigger him.

49:23.877 --> 49:25.545
[Book] <i>I'll have to pull you out now.</i>

49:25.629 --> 49:28.173
<i>I'm in a stable pocket,</i>
<i>but it won't be for long.</i>

49:28.256 --> 49:30.759
<i>Meet me at the rendezvous point.</i>
<i>Osyraa's here.</i>

49:32.386 --> 49:33.679
Osyraa.

49:33.762 --> 49:36.348
Michael, I must ask the impossible.

49:36.431 --> 49:37.724
I need you to stay.

49:38.308 --> 49:40.477
-Captain.
-If we leave Su'Kal alone,

49:40.560 --> 49:42.896
it's a matter of time
before the Burn happens again.

49:42.979 --> 49:46.233
-With your xenoanthropological skills--
-Right. But it has to be you.

49:46.983 --> 49:48.235
I am the captain.

49:48.318 --> 49:50.362
He responded to you when you sang.

49:50.445 --> 49:51.863
You have a connection with him.

49:51.947 --> 49:54.866
Osyraa is here.
My responsibility is to the <i>Discovery</i>

49:54.950 --> 49:56.451
-and her crew.
-You'll be distracted.

49:56.535 --> 49:59.204
I will not allow emotions
to factor into my decisions.

49:59.287 --> 50:00.372
Saru...

50:01.289 --> 50:02.374
you already have.

50:06.545 --> 50:08.714
Whatever Tilly needs,
I will be there for her.

50:08.797 --> 50:10.799
[dramatic music playing]

50:13.969 --> 50:16.263
-Okay, come on.
-I'm staying.

50:16.346 --> 50:17.723
-Hugh.
-[Saru] Dr. Culber.

50:18.557 --> 50:22.018
I know what it's like to be alone in
a world that doesn't make sense, captain.

50:23.437 --> 50:25.105
No one should experience that.

50:25.647 --> 50:27.482
Not you and not Su'Kal.

50:29.901 --> 50:31.278
You tell Paul I love him.

50:32.904 --> 50:34.781
[Book] <i>I'm here. Where are you?</i>

50:36.658 --> 50:38.410
I'll come back for both of you.

50:38.493 --> 50:39.953
If more than a day goes by...

50:40.662 --> 50:41.705
there's no point.

50:45.083 --> 50:47.002
[Book] Come on, Michael, where are you?

50:47.085 --> 50:50.964
[computer] <i>Radiation levels elevated.</i>
<i>Shields at 60 percent.</i>

50:51.047 --> 50:52.299
Adira?

50:53.467 --> 50:55.969
-I'm beaming down.
-No way I'm letting you off.

50:56.052 --> 50:58.972
They need this medication
to survive until <i>Discovery </i>comes back.

50:59.055 --> 51:01.057
Reno gave me her badge to transport.

51:01.141 --> 51:03.435
-I'm not asking for permission.
-Hey!

51:06.897 --> 51:09.232
[sighs] Damn it, Adira.

51:09.316 --> 51:11.067
[computer] <i>Shields at 40 percent.</i>

51:11.151 --> 51:12.027
Come on, Michael.

51:12.110 --> 51:13.528
Where the hell are you guys?

51:14.613 --> 51:15.447
Gotcha.

51:16.406 --> 51:18.909
-Book.
-<i>Radiation levels critical.</i>

51:18.992 --> 51:22.037
-[Burnham] Stay back. [groans]
-You're dangerously radioactive. Big deal.

51:22.120 --> 51:23.371
<i>Shields at 30 percent.</i>

51:23.455 --> 51:26.917
This should help.
Gonna need some love from Dr. Pollard.

51:27.000 --> 51:28.960
Let's worry about that when I get back.

51:29.044 --> 51:30.462
Where are the others?

51:31.463 --> 51:33.006
We have to go back for them.

51:33.965 --> 51:35.425
I'll explain on the way.

51:36.092 --> 51:37.803
<i>-Shields at 20 percent.</i>
-[Burnham groans]

51:38.386 --> 51:40.096
Adira was here. They beamed down.

51:40.180 --> 51:41.640
-Couldn't get a lock.
-What?

51:41.723 --> 51:43.934
On the bright side,
they took my radiation pills.

51:44.476 --> 51:46.353
-Should buy them some time.
-I hope so.

51:46.436 --> 51:48.522
<i>Shields at critical levels.</i>

51:48.605 --> 51:49.439
Let's go.

51:53.610 --> 51:55.821
[Tilly] <i>Stamets,</i>
<i>what's happening down there?</i>

51:56.655 --> 51:57.781
<i>Stamets?</i>

51:58.365 --> 51:59.241
I won't help you.

51:59.324 --> 52:01.117
You can't use it without me.

52:01.201 --> 52:03.119
What you want is irrelevant.

52:03.203 --> 52:05.205
No. Please no!

52:06.998 --> 52:09.000
[whirring]

52:12.879 --> 52:16.383
-[Detmer] I can't get us out of this.
-Commander Stamets, respond.

52:20.470 --> 52:21.805
Charming.

52:22.931 --> 52:24.349
Take their badges.

52:31.481 --> 52:32.315
Get up.

52:32.399 --> 52:34.401
You know,
you're gonna have to kill me first.

52:34.484 --> 52:37.821
And get blood all over the chair?
[chuckles] Please.

52:39.531 --> 52:40.866
Ahh...

52:44.703 --> 52:47.038
You two make the smart choice.

52:47.122 --> 52:48.790
Take your hands off the console.

52:52.669 --> 52:53.795
This isn't over.

52:54.504 --> 52:55.338
Oh?

52:56.381 --> 52:57.507
[sighs]

52:58.967 --> 53:00.135
I think it is.

53:01.511 --> 53:04.806
Coordinates for Federation headquarters
are already set.

53:05.640 --> 53:07.267
I mean, how convenient.

53:08.226 --> 53:11.730
Now, tell me, what is it you say
when you do your jumpy thing?

53:13.106 --> 53:14.566
Huh? Anybody?

53:16.443 --> 53:17.277
Fine.

53:19.362 --> 53:20.530
Get us out of here.

53:21.740 --> 53:23.742
[dramatic music playing]

53:31.791 --> 53:34.628
No, no. Oh, no.

53:41.343 --> 53:42.344
We're too late.
