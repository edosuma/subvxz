WEBVTT

00:02.265 --> 00:03.820
HE GROANS

00:03.977 --> 00:05.097
I didn't kill your girls.

00:05.217 --> 00:06.617
Yes, you did.

00:06.777 --> 00:10.057
I tried to warn you, over and
over, and you wouldn't listen.

00:10.217 --> 00:13.337
As soon as you put this on
me, you dug their graves.

00:13.497 --> 00:15.617
Why do you think nothing
bad has happened to you,

00:15.737 --> 00:16.777
ever since you met her?

00:16.937 --> 00:19.417
She is the worst luck that
could ever happen to you.

00:19.577 --> 00:22.217
If Winter found out that
you'd stolen evidence...

00:22.377 --> 00:24.137
You do it, stuff like
that, all the time.

00:24.297 --> 00:25.617
Yeah, but I do it so you don't have to.

00:25.817 --> 00:27.105
You want to be transferred?

00:27.132 --> 00:30.465
I think a fresh start
would be best for everyone.

00:31.737 --> 00:34.817
The flat burned down.
I've no other clothes.

00:36.337 --> 00:37.937
Don't touch my pants.

00:38.097 --> 00:41.057
It was just an accident, pure bad luck.

00:41.217 --> 00:44.217
It happened about the same
time you sent me that text.

00:44.337 --> 00:45.937
I was innocent.

00:46.097 --> 00:48.457
- Purer than the driven snow.
- Not quite.

01:43.897 --> 01:46.217
Is the kebab such a good idea?

01:46.337 --> 01:48.097
You what?

01:48.257 --> 01:51.497
I said, is the kebab such a good idea?

01:51.657 --> 01:55.297
I drive with one hand, darling,
don't worry, you're safe with me.

01:55.417 --> 01:57.577
It's you I'm thinking about.

01:57.697 --> 01:59.417
All that saturated fat.

02:00.737 --> 02:02.377
It's not good for your arteries.

02:02.537 --> 02:05.457
I'm here for a good
time, not a long time.

02:08.056 --> 02:11.897
I said, I'm here for a
good time, not a long time.

02:26.617 --> 02:28.377
Sure this is where you want dropped?

02:28.497 --> 02:30.337
Yeah.

02:30.497 --> 02:32.057
You could get attacked
out here on your own.

02:32.177 --> 02:33.337
I'm fine.

02:34.657 --> 02:35.959
It's 25 quid, then.

02:39.537 --> 02:41.057
Oh!

02:41.177 --> 02:42.257
Oi!

You may kiss me now.

04:04.657 --> 04:06.857
I need a shower.

04:06.977 --> 04:08.977
Me, too.

04:09.097 --> 04:12.497
You can't, it's my brother's place.

04:12.617 --> 04:14.897
So, stay dirty.

04:15.017 --> 04:16.057
I need to go to work.

04:17.976 --> 04:19.857
I'll call Rui.

04:21.057 --> 04:22.497
He's here tonight.

04:28.377 --> 04:30.297
Harry?

04:30.417 --> 04:32.217
What are you doing, tonight?

04:32.337 --> 04:34.936
I don't know, I'll call you later.

04:41.017 --> 04:42.977
I want to talk... about Isabella.

04:44.137 --> 04:45.657
I don't know who you're talking about.

04:45.817 --> 04:47.983
She's literally calling you, right now.

04:48.067 --> 04:49.538
That's not my phone.

04:49.843 --> 04:51.297
Oh.

04:56.377 --> 04:58.937
Your name is Rui Hirota...

04:59.057 --> 04:59.977
No, it isn't.

05:01.457 --> 05:02.497
OK.

05:06.337 --> 05:09.244
When you're ready to talk, let me know.

05:16.537 --> 05:18.457
What time did you get in at last night?

05:18.577 --> 05:19.497
Late.

05:20.577 --> 05:22.817
Oh. Er...

05:22.937 --> 05:25.977
Hello. Hi, you must be Rich.

05:26.137 --> 05:29.695
I didn't realise Harry
had... a friend staying over.

05:29.718 --> 05:30.718
Isabella.

05:31.297 --> 05:34.217
- Nice to meet you.
- So, you hear lots about me?

05:34.337 --> 05:35.417
Oh, lots.

05:35.537 --> 05:37.637
It's great to finally meet you.

05:38.737 --> 05:39.263
Coffee?

05:39.279 --> 05:41.932
No, I'm afraid I'm going to
have to love you and leave you.

05:41.937 --> 05:44.457
I have a taxi outside. But
it's really nice to meet you.

05:44.617 --> 05:47.697
And I hope that we spend
more time together, soon.

05:47.817 --> 05:50.337
OK.

05:50.457 --> 05:51.377
Bye.

05:55.457 --> 05:56.777
She gone?

05:56.897 --> 05:59.409
- Yes.
- Thanks.

06:01.417 --> 06:05.097
Well, she seems... interesting.

06:05.217 --> 06:06.697
That's one word for her.

06:06.857 --> 06:11.777
Foreign, classy, beautiful,
how do you manage it?

06:11.937 --> 06:13.897
I honestly wouldn't know where to start.

06:14.057 --> 06:16.537
Well, imagine I already
know about your childhood,

06:16.697 --> 06:19.217
your failed marriage and
your recent homelessness.

06:21.897 --> 06:23.817
Maybe it's a language barrier.

06:23.977 --> 06:27.497
Yeah, maybe she doesn't understand
a single word you're saying.

06:27.657 --> 06:29.614
- That's why it's working out so well.
- Funny

06:29.654 --> 06:30.654
Oh, come on.

06:30.737 --> 06:32.617
She's gorgeous!

06:32.817 --> 06:34.453
What have you possibly
got to complain about?

06:34.461 --> 06:36.661
I'm not sure, that's the problem.

06:37.617 --> 06:41.057
The amount of relationships you've
screwed up because she likes some

06:41.217 --> 06:44.297
- silly cocktail or doesn't like Man U.
- No, no, no, this is more...

06:46.506 --> 06:48.026
She might be...

06:51.160 --> 06:52.120
So...?

06:52.777 --> 06:54.457
So...?

06:54.577 --> 06:57.337
So, you need to find out for sure.

06:57.497 --> 07:00.497
Because if she is a good one,
you don't want to let her go.

07:14.897 --> 07:17.680
- Morning.
- Morning.

07:17.712 --> 07:20.645
Dog walker found him
floating, first thing.

07:21.414 --> 07:22.814
Do we have an ID?

07:22.857 --> 07:26.497
Suri and Orwell are checking
out the taxi, we think it's his.

07:26.617 --> 07:28.817
So, you heard about Steve?

07:28.937 --> 07:30.857
No. What's he done, now?

07:30.977 --> 07:33.060
He's requested a transfer.

07:37.217 --> 07:41.697
Buster Wiley, date of birth
eighth of the fifth, '66.

07:43.057 --> 07:44.897
I told him to think
on it a couple of days.

07:45.517 --> 07:47.997
He might change his mind if he felt...

07:49.017 --> 07:51.897
..less isolated from the team.

07:52.057 --> 07:54.322
Doesn't look like he's been in
the water that long, does it?

07:54.417 --> 07:56.417
Harry, did you hear me?

07:56.537 --> 07:58.177
I'm not sure what I can do.

07:58.377 --> 08:01.222
You know, I thought you might
be a little more understanding

08:01.286 --> 08:04.086
of the redemptive
power of second chances.

08:05.497 --> 08:07.057
You're saying Buster topped himself?

08:07.177 --> 08:08.777
Jumped off the railway bridge?

08:08.937 --> 08:11.257
Cab's registered to a B Wiley.

08:11.377 --> 08:13.577
Married, two kids in their 20s.

08:13.697 --> 08:15.737
Also, he's got a dash cam.

08:15.857 --> 08:17.377
Could be useful.

08:17.497 --> 08:18.897
Check it out, Steve.

08:26.577 --> 08:28.177
Daisy?

08:28.297 --> 08:30.177
Hello, love. You all right?

08:30.337 --> 08:33.616
Mum says you think you've
got a magic bracelet.

08:33.736 --> 08:35.376
This?

08:35.537 --> 08:38.616
You skipped school to ask me
a stupid question like that?

08:38.736 --> 08:40.297
You think you've got problems, Dad?

08:40.457 --> 08:43.238
- Everyone has problems.
- Tell me about it.

08:44.617 --> 08:47.017
You can talk to me
about anything, you know.

08:47.137 --> 08:48.457
I mean, if you ever need to.

08:48.577 --> 08:49.817
I don't need to talk.

08:50.937 --> 08:53.017
I just wanted to know that
you weren't going insane.

08:53.137 --> 08:55.097
Do I look insane?

08:55.217 --> 08:56.577
Come home, then.

08:57.817 --> 09:00.577
- Stop being an arse.
- I can't.

09:01.897 --> 09:03.097
Come home, I mean.

09:05.560 --> 09:08.657
Come on... I'll drop you back to school.

09:15.777 --> 09:18.377
So, what we're looking at?

09:18.537 --> 09:21.497
Asphyxiation, caused
by aspiration of fluid.

09:21.697 --> 09:22.337
In this case,

09:22.392 --> 09:26.092
canal water, into the air
passages as a result of submersion.

09:26.097 --> 09:28.457
- He drowned.
- Anyone else involved?

09:28.617 --> 09:30.245
Well, there's no signs of a struggle.

09:30.251 --> 09:34.057
No cuts or bruises or lesions
inconsistent with a death by drowning.

09:34.177 --> 09:35.257
What about this scar?

09:35.417 --> 09:39.137
- An operation?
- Heart bypass, relatively fresh, too.

09:39.257 --> 09:40.657
When do we get the tox report?

09:40.777 --> 09:42.137
Oh, it'll be a while, I'm afraid.

09:42.297 --> 09:45.417
They're backed up. I'm still waiting
for reports from two weeks ago.

09:45.856 --> 09:47.096
Can you try and speed it up?

09:47.128 --> 09:49.257
I'd like to clear this
up as quick as possible,

09:49.377 --> 09:51.377
so we can solve some real murders.

09:51.497 --> 09:53.617
I can certainly try, DI Clayton.

09:53.737 --> 09:55.457
Good lad.

09:58.097 --> 09:59.852
How was the pathologist?

09:59.930 --> 10:02.377
Waiting on the tox report, you?

10:02.537 --> 10:06.497
Yeah, I extracted that dash
cam footage you asked for.

10:06.617 --> 10:10.657
Oh, yeah? So, what did you get?

10:10.777 --> 10:13.097
Apart from one very sad cabbie.

10:13.217 --> 10:14.577
Have a look.

10:16.417 --> 10:19.790
- Who's she?
- That is his last fare.

10:21.537 --> 10:23.217
Rewind.

10:23.337 --> 10:24.657
Stop it there.

10:26.057 --> 10:28.306
Can you not get a
clearer image than that?

10:28.393 --> 10:29.659
That's all we have.

10:30.486 --> 10:35.039
So, how does a 15-stone man
chasing a girl half his size

10:35.054 --> 10:36.414
end up in the water?

10:37.097 --> 10:39.817
He goes for her, she pushes him in?

10:39.937 --> 10:41.657
Either way, this isn't suicide.

10:41.777 --> 10:44.334
- Great work, Steve.
- Maybe it's not.

10:47.137 --> 10:48.577
We need to find her.

11:18.137 --> 11:20.897
You seem upset. Can I help?

11:21.017 --> 11:23.057
I've just got a bit of a hangover.

11:28.038 --> 11:29.438
You look familiar.

11:30.137 --> 11:32.657
Do I know you from somewhere?

11:32.777 --> 11:34.937
- Maybe from a meeting.
- Oh, God!

11:36.057 --> 11:38.217
Forget I said I had
a hangover, will you?

11:39.697 --> 11:41.337
I won't say a word.

11:41.457 --> 11:43.737
How long since you were sober?

11:43.857 --> 11:45.177
Are you hearing me?

11:45.297 --> 11:47.777
- We're just talking.
- You are.

11:49.777 --> 11:51.257
You had a liver transplant.

11:52.777 --> 11:55.057
How do you know that?

11:55.177 --> 11:57.177
You mentioned it in a meeting.

11:57.297 --> 11:59.257
Did I? I didn't think I...

11:59.457 --> 12:03.377
You know, there are thousands of
people waiting for organ transplants.

12:03.537 --> 12:07.737
Oh, God, you don't need
to make me feel bad, OK?

12:07.897 --> 12:09.265
I honestly couldn't feel worse.

12:09.304 --> 12:11.731
Saying you feel bad isn't enough.

12:14.377 --> 12:15.657
Which meeting did you come to?

12:15.800 --> 12:17.960
You have to change, Julie.

12:18.057 --> 12:20.336
- Which one?
- Paddington.

12:21.417 --> 12:24.577
I've never been to a
meeting in Paddington.

12:38.199 --> 12:39.159
Harry?

12:39.459 --> 12:40.859
Johnny.

12:42.579 --> 12:44.459
I'm looking for my wife.

12:46.499 --> 12:48.259
I didn't know you'd be entertaining.

12:48.379 --> 12:50.419
- Behave.
- Daisy about?

12:50.539 --> 12:52.259
I thought I'd run her to school.

12:52.419 --> 12:55.379
No, she's got hockey today
before classes. You've missed her.

12:55.499 --> 12:56.739
Hockey?!

12:56.899 --> 12:57.907
Since when?

12:57.924 --> 13:00.939
She's very good, you should
go and watch her play.

13:01.779 --> 13:03.779
At least it keeps her
off that bloody computer.

13:03.939 --> 13:07.299
Anna, I've said it before,
it's nothing to worry about.

13:07.419 --> 13:09.539
- It's perfectly normal.
- What's up?

13:09.606 --> 13:11.388
I know, I know, I'm
just being hypersensitive

13:11.412 --> 13:13.734
because of everything
that happened with...

13:13.739 --> 13:16.899
Oh, is she having difficulty
adjusting to Johnny?

13:17.059 --> 13:20.619
No. She's just always
upstairs with the door shut.

13:20.779 --> 13:23.339
She's 13 years old. I'd think there
was something up, if she wasn't.

13:23.459 --> 13:25.459
Exactly what I said.

13:28.979 --> 13:32.099
Look, why don't I go upstairs
and finish getting dressed?

13:34.339 --> 13:35.739
It's just, every time I...

13:35.899 --> 13:38.899
..try and have a look,
she just closes the laptop.

13:39.059 --> 13:42.339
Well, she doesn't want her
mum to see her Instagram or...

13:42.459 --> 13:43.979
I know, I know, I get it.

13:44.139 --> 13:45.819
I wouldn't want my mum reading my diary.

13:46.019 --> 13:47.299
It's just there's something about

13:47.338 --> 13:49.805
the urgency with which she closes it.

13:51.419 --> 13:55.139
- You checked her history?
- Suspiciously clean.

13:55.299 --> 13:57.579
You want me to take a look?

13:57.699 --> 13:59.099
Be discreet, will you?

13:59.219 --> 14:00.139
I am a professional.

14:05.739 --> 14:07.019
What?

14:25.414 --> 14:29.693
_ _

15:23.440 --> 15:25.299
Rui?

15:35.819 --> 15:37.126
Yes?

15:37.235 --> 15:38.352
I'm calling to let you know that

15:38.396 --> 15:41.214
someone checked for your
name on the Interpol system.

15:41.219 --> 15:44.219
The user was a DI Harry Clayton.

15:47.339 --> 15:49.659
- Miss Augustine...
- I heard you.

15:49.819 --> 15:53.259
- Should I take care of this
- No, I'll do it.

15:53.419 --> 15:57.659
Would you keep an eye on him and
let me know where he is at all times?

15:57.779 --> 15:59.219
Thank you.

16:05.299 --> 16:06.539
She'd kill me if I talked.

16:10.739 --> 16:13.259
- I'll kill you.
- I haven't done anything wrong.

16:13.379 --> 16:14.939
You help her kill people.

16:15.001 --> 16:18.134
No, I don't. I just drive,
and she doesn't kill anyone.

16:19.579 --> 16:23.579
Oh, so she just wants them
dead and somehow they die?

16:24.859 --> 16:26.219
So you know it already?

16:27.379 --> 16:29.939
You don't need me to
tell you what she is.

16:30.059 --> 16:31.659
Really? What's that?

16:31.779 --> 16:33.099
Magnificent.

16:34.619 --> 16:37.859
No, she's just a thug in a posh frock.

16:37.979 --> 16:39.539
You're just jealous.

16:39.699 --> 16:43.419
Tell me everything you know,
and you can go back to her.

16:46.179 --> 16:49.099
- Afternoon.
- She has an operation scar, like Buster.

16:49.259 --> 16:51.819
That's right. This poor
girl was on her second liver.

16:51.939 --> 16:54.379
She'd had a transplant?

16:54.539 --> 16:56.579
Oh, watch out, Suri,
he's catching up with you

16:56.699 --> 16:58.779
- She's so young.
- Hmm.

16:58.899 --> 17:00.939
Now, this is what you want to know.

17:01.059 --> 17:02.419
Ever hear of Pentaprevin?

17:02.579 --> 17:06.138
Big centre-half, played for Lamiakos.

17:06.299 --> 17:09.659
It's a short-acting skeletal muscle
relaxant, mostly used in hospitals.

17:09.819 --> 17:10.758
What for?

17:10.807 --> 17:13.574
It's used in tandem with a
sedative to anaesthetise patients

17:13.579 --> 17:15.939
before surgery, hugely specialised.

17:16.019 --> 17:17.183
Now, look here.

17:19.098 --> 17:22.618
I have to confess, I missed
this on my first pass, but,

17:22.779 --> 17:25.392
after the tox report showed
Pentaprevin in Buster's system,

17:25.397 --> 17:26.518
I had another look.

17:27.699 --> 17:29.139
What are we looking at?

17:29.299 --> 17:32.419
There, do you see? I think
that is a needle mark.

17:32.539 --> 17:34.939
What? Does she have, erm...

17:34.945 --> 17:36.376
- Pentaprevin?
- Yeah.

17:36.406 --> 17:38.273
Oh, I'd need a tox report.

17:39.019 --> 17:42.299
- How long?
- Here's one I prepared earlier.

17:42.419 --> 17:44.092
Good boy. And...?

17:44.098 --> 17:46.699
Pentaprevin, yes. Now, look at this.

17:49.238 --> 17:51.158
See?

17:51.459 --> 17:52.739
So they're related?

17:52.859 --> 17:54.219
You're the detectives.

17:54.379 --> 17:56.139
But one other thing she'd been drinking,

17:56.299 --> 17:58.457
which is very naughty if
you've had a liver transplant.

17:58.519 --> 18:01.139
All right. So, were they
poisoned or were they drowned?

18:01.299 --> 18:04.339
Both. I think they were
incapacitated by the Pentaprevin,

18:04.459 --> 18:06.019
then thrown in the water.

18:06.179 --> 18:09.139
So, they were conscious, but
they couldn't save themselves?

18:09.259 --> 18:11.339
Exactly. It's a terrible way to die.

18:11.499 --> 18:14.859
You know you're drowning,
but you just can't move.

18:14.979 --> 18:15.979
Jesus.

18:16.179 --> 18:17.414
Yes, hello

18:17.487 --> 18:20.397
This is Detective Steve Orwell
with the Murder Investigation Squad.

18:20.468 --> 18:23.579
I'm looking to speak to someone
in the anaesthesiology department.

18:23.713 --> 18:25.104
I've got a list here of all the deaths

18:25.151 --> 18:27.974
on Regent's Canal in the last
18 months. Where do I start?

18:27.979 --> 18:29.517
Can I leave my number and ask...?

18:29.523 --> 18:32.299
Both of our victims had had
major surgery, so check the list,

18:32.419 --> 18:34.059
see if anyone matches that profile.

18:34.219 --> 18:36.219
There are more deaths in
the canals than you think.

18:36.379 --> 18:39.259
Well, crosscheck the names
with their medical records

18:39.419 --> 18:42.179
to see what that throws
up. I'm feeling lucky.

18:42.339 --> 18:45.659
What about our suspect,
the lady in the black coat?

18:45.712 --> 18:48.259
Now, well, your footage
didn't offer us much, did it?

18:48.419 --> 18:53.139
Bingo. Daniel Green, three
weeks ago... 50s, body in canal,

18:53.259 --> 18:54.539
suspected suicide.

18:54.699 --> 18:57.739
He was receiving regular treatment
from a private hospital called the

18:57.899 --> 19:00.031
- Regent Clinic.
- Did he have a transplant, or what?

19:00.164 --> 19:01.499
I don't know, it doesn't say.

19:01.659 --> 19:05.339
Right, let's go. You keep
bashing the phones, big lad.

19:05.499 --> 19:09.899
How come I work my arse
off and you just get lucky?

19:10.059 --> 19:12.379
We're here to discuss one
of your patients with you.

19:12.499 --> 19:14.259
Daniel Green.

19:14.277 --> 19:17.317
I doubt I could help you, what
with doctor-patient confidentiality.

19:17.383 --> 19:18.895
Let's see how we go, shall we?

19:21.139 --> 19:24.139
Before he died, was Mr Green depressed?

19:24.299 --> 19:26.379
Well, he was suffering
from terminal cancer,

19:26.579 --> 19:28.314
so I don't think it's a
stretch to say he wasn't in the

19:28.338 --> 19:29.604
highest of spirits.

19:29.899 --> 19:32.899
I understand he recently
had a major operation.

19:33.066 --> 19:36.266
As I've said, I can't discuss
a patient's medical details.

19:36.316 --> 19:37.378
Well, you know, I can come back here

19:37.394 --> 19:38.980
with a warrant for the information,

19:38.988 --> 19:42.579
bring 30 policemen, uniforms,
we'll stick around here for a while.

19:42.699 --> 19:43.899
What would you prefer?

19:45.419 --> 19:47.579
He'd had a successful lung transplant.

19:47.739 --> 19:51.059
It's an extremely rare
procedure, but he could afford it.

19:51.179 --> 19:52.779
How much does this treatment cost?

19:52.902 --> 19:54.347
Well, I'm not at
liberty to discuss that.

19:54.353 --> 19:56.301
But I doubt I could afford one.

19:57.619 --> 19:59.659
If he paid all that
money for a transplant,

19:59.779 --> 20:01.739
why would you think he was suicidal?

20:01.939 --> 20:04.471
One of the doctors saw him
smoking outside the hospital,

20:04.550 --> 20:05.550
post-operation.

20:05.699 --> 20:07.499
None of us could believe it, really.

20:07.659 --> 20:09.819
Felt like he was sticking
two fingers up at God.

20:09.939 --> 20:12.019
Do you use Pentaprevin here?

20:12.139 --> 20:13.499
We do. Why do you ask?

20:13.608 --> 20:15.022
We'll need the names and addresses

20:15.086 --> 20:16.854
of any staff that might have access.

20:16.859 --> 20:19.899
I can't give you those,
it's confidential.

20:20.019 --> 20:21.779
That's funny, that thing you do.

20:21.939 --> 20:26.062
- I'm sorry?
- You know, when your eyes turn away.

20:26.619 --> 20:29.059
Dry mouth, swallow.

20:29.219 --> 20:31.619
You're doing it now.
Not much of a poker face.

20:34.859 --> 20:36.139
Whatever it is you're hiding

20:36.146 --> 20:38.130
has got very little to do with
doctor-patient confidentiality,

20:38.161 --> 20:39.579
wouldn't you say so, Dr Jones?

20:40.619 --> 20:45.419
We had to let someone go recently,
someone who would have had access.

20:45.539 --> 20:47.219
- How long ago?
- About a month.

20:47.339 --> 20:49.339
She was a nurse at the practice.

20:49.459 --> 20:50.899
What was her name?

20:51.019 --> 20:52.939
Scarlett Cartmell.

20:53.028 --> 20:54.247
Why did you sack her?

20:54.256 --> 20:56.014
She was caught stealing drugs.

20:56.019 --> 20:58.255
- Pentaprevin?
- Yes,

20:58.332 --> 21:00.666
and a variety of other substances.

21:01.059 --> 21:03.539
- She was an addict
- I take it you reported this?

21:03.699 --> 21:06.659
There was concern raised over the
potential public relations fallout.

21:07.939 --> 21:10.739
Write down Scarlett
Cartmell's details now.

21:13.099 --> 21:15.139
Do you think she's our woman in black?

21:15.299 --> 21:18.419
- Well, it's like looking likely.
- What's her motive?

21:18.579 --> 21:21.179
She loses her job, feels hard done by,

21:21.339 --> 21:22.610
takes it out on others

21:22.690 --> 21:25.294
who have had second
chances but squandered them.

21:25.299 --> 21:26.009
Buster Wiley,

21:26.119 --> 21:28.934
he kept eating kebabs, his
wife said as much, Julie Tracey,

21:28.939 --> 21:32.705
she kept drinking,
Daniel Green kept smoking.

21:34.299 --> 21:35.259
Jesus.

21:36.362 --> 21:37.962
She's killing addicts.

21:39.059 --> 21:41.099
What's the matter, think
you're next on the list?

21:42.179 --> 21:44.139
No I...

21:44.259 --> 21:46.883
- I'm not an addict.
- Sure

21:47.008 --> 21:51.219
I'm... You've got a lot more
gobby in the last month, you know?

22:05.699 --> 22:07.699
Scarlett Cartmell, police, open up.

22:11.699 --> 22:13.699
Right, I'll have to
break it down, stand back.

22:18.739 --> 22:22.419
Well, I can close it again if
you really want to break it down.

22:22.539 --> 22:24.419
As I said, gobby.

22:28.950 --> 22:30.070
Scarlett?

22:59.099 --> 23:02.019
Jesus! God. Suri?

23:06.939 --> 23:08.459
SHE GAGS

23:09.414 --> 23:10.814
It looks like an overdose.

23:12.294 --> 23:13.734
Approximate time of death?

23:15.134 --> 23:18.414
I'd say she's been lying there
for a good three, four weeks,

23:18.574 --> 23:21.414
if I had to guess,
which, basically, I do.

23:21.534 --> 23:23.323
So she's not our killer.

23:23.626 --> 23:26.226
- Well, thanks for coming down.
- That's fine.

23:26.614 --> 23:29.614
It was the right call. Her
body's too delicate to move.

23:30.147 --> 23:31.907
Difficult to do an autopsy on soup.

23:33.392 --> 23:34.672
Right, Ralph.

23:40.456 --> 23:41.543
How are we getting on?

23:41.769 --> 23:44.733
Almost everything on the list that
Kenneth gave us is accounted for.

23:44.803 --> 23:45.803
Sir.

23:46.145 --> 23:46.871
Almost?

23:46.903 --> 23:50.103
We're missing some morphine
and the Pentaprevin.

23:50.145 --> 23:52.105
Well, looks like
Scarlett had the morphine.

23:53.205 --> 23:54.445
So our killer is still out there?

23:54.510 --> 23:56.390
Yep, with the stolen Pentaprevin.

24:00.790 --> 24:02.712
Hello? Excuse me.

24:02.782 --> 24:04.790
'You're not avoiding me, are you?'

24:04.902 --> 24:07.462
- Me? Never.
- 'Great'.

24:07.590 --> 24:08.867
'Shall we meet up?'

24:08.921 --> 24:12.630
- Sure. When?
- 'How about right now?'

24:21.630 --> 24:24.710
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, I was just out for a walk.

24:24.870 --> 24:27.670
My driver seems to
have taken the day off.

24:27.790 --> 24:32.710
Come here.

24:32.830 --> 24:34.430
In.

24:37.310 --> 24:38.310
So?

24:39.950 --> 24:41.190
How are you here?

24:41.350 --> 24:45.550
This is a crime scene. A murder scene.

24:45.670 --> 24:48.750
I wanted to see you, Harry, and...

24:48.870 --> 24:50.870
I tend to get what I want.

24:50.990 --> 24:53.070
I've had this for ten years.

24:53.190 --> 24:55.510
Finding you is...

24:56.790 --> 25:01.504
Plus, I've gathered friends around
me, people who'll do anything.

25:04.590 --> 25:07.550
But I guess the honeymoon is over.

25:07.710 --> 25:10.430
That's why you did an
Interpol check on me.

25:10.590 --> 25:14.190
I told you I have friends, but at
least I'm being honest with you,

25:14.310 --> 25:15.790
which makes one of us.

25:17.230 --> 25:19.790
And then there was that
chat the other night,

25:19.950 --> 25:23.345
full of hints and
innuendos about a man dying.

25:24.652 --> 25:26.132
Was that you?

25:27.133 --> 25:28.573
Do I kill people?

25:29.950 --> 25:31.910
Do you?

25:32.030 --> 25:34.230
What does my police record say?

25:36.344 --> 25:37.624
It's clean.

25:39.350 --> 25:41.150
Spotless.

25:42.761 --> 25:44.652
Almost artificially so.

25:46.310 --> 25:48.790
What about Rui, my driver?
What have you done with him?

25:49.870 --> 25:50.830
Nothing.

25:53.190 --> 25:56.404
Looks like we both
have trust issues, then.

25:59.350 --> 26:02.168
I'm not sure what I
feel about you working.

26:03.790 --> 26:08.030
On the one hand, the
authority's undeniably a turn-on.

26:09.950 --> 26:11.870
On the other, you're not much fun.

26:12.030 --> 26:15.470
I've only ever been
honest with you, Harry.

26:15.630 --> 26:19.070
- What are you afraid of?
- I shouldn't be doing this.

26:19.094 --> 26:20.687
Then stop me.

26:20.808 --> 26:23.608
Sorry, sir, sorry to bother
you, but we need to move the van.

26:26.750 --> 26:28.470
Come home with me.

26:29.043 --> 26:30.963
- I can't.
- Please.

26:34.750 --> 26:36.230
Sir?

26:36.297 --> 26:39.368
I am trying to question a witness
here, fuckin' eejits, move!

26:39.604 --> 26:40.844
Sorry, sir.

26:49.270 --> 26:51.750
Morning, what's the craic?

26:51.910 --> 26:57.150
Got a possible lead, Emily Sorkin,
works at the clinic, knew Scarlett,

26:57.270 --> 26:58.950
had access to the drugs,

26:59.110 --> 27:01.150
pretty good height match
for the figure in the video.

27:01.310 --> 27:03.430
We reckon she could
be our woman in black.

27:03.550 --> 27:04.830
Have you got an address?

27:06.430 --> 27:08.790
Good. Suri, let's check her out.

27:08.950 --> 27:12.390
I think since Steve did the
heavy lifting, he should go.

27:12.510 --> 27:14.310
- Orwell?
- I'll go with him.

27:15.910 --> 27:18.590
- OK, don't lose her.
- I'm sure we'll be fine.

27:21.390 --> 27:24.779
If you wanted, you could break
the news to Scarlett's next of kin.

27:45.390 --> 27:47.030
Anna!

27:47.944 --> 27:49.608
Oh, hello.

27:49.655 --> 27:51.270
That's such a coincidence.

27:51.390 --> 27:52.750
Are you drinking alone?

27:52.910 --> 27:57.110
I'm waiting for Johnny, he's,
um, he's been held up in traffic.

27:57.270 --> 28:00.506
Well, I'm on my own, so it's perfect.

28:05.830 --> 28:07.738
I admire you.

28:07.918 --> 28:09.379
Really?

28:09.489 --> 28:12.345
Yeah, well, not just
because of your work..

28:12.350 --> 28:16.030
After everything Harry did to
you, you still make time for him,

28:16.190 --> 28:18.630
and let him be with your daughter.

28:18.750 --> 28:20.550
You're almost too kind.

28:21.710 --> 28:23.550
Yes, well, he's hard to get rid of.

28:27.430 --> 28:30.430
But he is worth sticking with, isn't he?

28:32.030 --> 28:35.030
I sometimes worry that I'm
betting on the wrong guy.

28:36.965 --> 28:39.121
- Your bracelet...
- Hmm

28:39.510 --> 28:42.630
- Where'd you get it?
- It's a gift from Harry, actually.

28:42.790 --> 28:45.950
It's an acquired
taste, but I do like it.

28:46.070 --> 28:47.691
Harry? Buying jewellery?

28:47.988 --> 28:49.004
Wow!

28:49.153 --> 28:52.300
I'm a bit worried that
my wrist will turn green.

28:52.910 --> 28:56.230
Yes, well, I wouldn't worry too
much about Harry, if I were you.

28:56.390 --> 28:59.350
You've clearly got him in
a very good place indeed.

29:00.870 --> 29:03.590
So sorry I'm late, darling.

29:03.750 --> 29:06.310
The most incredible set of
circumstances delayed me.

29:06.430 --> 29:08.550
You wouldn't believe...

29:27.390 --> 29:28.750
So, this new Suri...

29:30.590 --> 29:32.350
What new Suri?

29:32.510 --> 29:35.070
Well, the one who shouts down her
boss and doesn't do what she's told.

29:35.190 --> 29:36.910
I'm not! That's, that's not...

29:37.030 --> 29:38.630
No, no, no, it's good, it's good.

29:38.790 --> 29:41.470
I mean, don't go full
Harry Clayton on us, but...

29:41.590 --> 29:42.870
No, I like it.

29:49.670 --> 29:51.270
Come on.

29:54.310 --> 29:56.190
Do you want to check around back?

29:56.403 --> 29:57.963
You check round the back.

30:06.750 --> 30:08.670
- Emily Sorkin?
- Yes.

30:10.710 --> 30:12.950
- Clare Cartmell?
- Yes?

30:13.070 --> 30:14.910
I'm DI Harry Clayton.

30:15.070 --> 30:17.630
I'm afraid I have some
bad news. May I come in?

30:18.870 --> 30:21.270
- Er, yes, yes, of course, come in.
- Thank you.

30:22.790 --> 30:25.018
Er, what's this about?

30:25.790 --> 30:28.674
It's about your sister, Scarlett.

30:30.030 --> 30:32.030
What's happened?

30:32.190 --> 30:35.050
I'm sorry to say she's
been found dead in her flat.

30:36.830 --> 30:38.230
Right.

30:39.670 --> 30:45.590
I would like to tell you that
this is a surprise, but it isn't.

30:45.710 --> 30:47.390
Was it an overdose?

30:47.510 --> 30:49.754
Yes. Were you close?

30:51.409 --> 30:52.849
Sometimes.

30:54.030 --> 30:55.990
I...

30:56.150 --> 30:59.030
I understand how
destructive addiction is.

31:00.110 --> 31:01.910
I don't believe in addiction.

31:02.030 --> 31:03.830
You don't?

31:03.990 --> 31:06.550
I don't believe it's a disease, anyway.

31:06.670 --> 31:07.590
It's a choice.

31:08.830 --> 31:13.710
A continuing series of choices.
My sister wasn't ill, I'm afraid.

31:15.552 --> 31:17.152
She just liked to get high.

31:18.230 --> 31:21.590
It's a bit more complicated
than that, surely?

31:21.710 --> 31:23.630
If addiction was a brain disease,

31:23.790 --> 31:26.510
the neurologists would be able
to find evidence backing it up,

31:26.630 --> 31:27.550
but they can't.

31:27.670 --> 31:30.190
The phrase, the idea,

31:30.350 --> 31:33.550
addiction is merely an
abdication of responsibility.

31:35.430 --> 31:38.270
Sorry, I... You must
think I'm a monster?

31:38.390 --> 31:39.671
No.

31:40.030 --> 31:43.150
Ms Cartmell, I deal with
real monsters every day.

31:45.870 --> 31:49.070
Look, I'm sorry, but I
really do have to get to work.

31:49.190 --> 31:50.510
No, of course, of course.

32:15.070 --> 32:17.430
What work do you do, by the way?

32:17.550 --> 32:19.390
I am an anaesthetist.

32:19.550 --> 32:23.870
Ah, a medical family. Did
you ever work with Scarlett?

32:24.030 --> 32:26.590
- No
- Did you work at the Regent Clinic?

32:29.237 --> 32:32.568
Well, here's my card.

32:32.912 --> 32:36.349
Please, if you feel I can
help in any way, give me call.

32:37.150 --> 32:39.150
One thing, uhm

32:39.310 --> 32:41.270
do you happen to have a
recent photo of Scarlett?

32:41.390 --> 32:44.710
- I'm afraid not.
- An old one, maybe?

32:46.230 --> 32:49.110
Um, would it be all right if
I dropped it into the station?

32:49.230 --> 32:51.350
As I said, I'm running late.

32:51.510 --> 32:54.103
I'm sorry, but do you
mind getting it now?

32:55.510 --> 32:56.950
Of course.

33:04.201 --> 33:07.771
_ _

33:22.856 --> 33:25.136
No good, I'm afraid,
she had a solid alibi.

33:25.296 --> 33:28.576
Maybe our murderer never
worked at the Regent Clinic.

33:28.736 --> 33:31.733
I'm going to look into locums,
see if there's a link there.

33:32.078 --> 33:33.638
Where's Harry?

33:34.056 --> 33:37.696
He's playing his condolences
to Scarlett's sister.

33:37.816 --> 33:39.856
No, really, he is.

33:39.976 --> 33:41.616
All right.

33:41.776 --> 33:44.536
Go through the list of
staff from other hospitals,

33:44.696 --> 33:46.496
see how many doors were
going to need to knock.

33:46.710 --> 33:47.710
Sir.

33:50.176 --> 33:53.016
'Hi, this is Harry Clayton,
please leave a message... '

34:03.655 --> 34:05.776
- I've got something.
- What is it?

34:05.976 --> 34:08.639
I've been going through the
agency list of all the locums

34:08.678 --> 34:10.650
- that work at the Regent Clinic?
- And...?

34:10.656 --> 34:13.710
There's an anaesthetist there who
also does shifts at the hospital

34:13.748 --> 34:15.577
wher Buster Wiley had his heart surgery,

34:15.679 --> 34:18.210
and the infirmary where Julie
Tracey had her transplant.

34:18.216 --> 34:21.016
- A woman?
- Yeah, and her name is Clare Cartmell.

34:25.136 --> 34:26.295
It isn't far.

34:35.678 --> 34:37.277
It's Harry's!

34:39.588 --> 34:41.388
I didn't kill Scarlett.

34:42.335 --> 34:46.016
She called me after she
lost her job. Wanted money.

34:47.216 --> 34:49.016
I wasn't going to help.

34:49.176 --> 34:52.696
If you keep giving money to people
like that, they never get better.

34:52.856 --> 34:57.497
But she was my sister, and I loved
her, so I went round to see her.

34:58.136 --> 35:01.661
And there she was, dead in the bath.

35:02.456 --> 35:04.976
And next to her was the Pentaprevin.

35:08.581 --> 35:10.816
I do work at the Regent Clinic,

35:11.568 --> 35:13.208
every now and then, as a locum.

35:14.976 --> 35:17.797
I was going in, and
there was Daniel Green,

35:17.860 --> 35:19.782
sucking on a cigarette outside.

35:21.016 --> 35:23.576
I looked at him, and I
thought about my sister...

35:25.016 --> 35:28.048
..and afterwards, it felt like justice.

35:43.776 --> 35:47.088
I am so sorry, I didn't
get a chance to stop.

35:47.299 --> 35:48.588
Oh, it's fine.

35:48.628 --> 35:50.346
No, no, come on, give me
your insurance details,

35:50.353 --> 35:52.590
- and I'll give you mine.
- No, no, honestly, it's fine.

35:52.596 --> 35:53.243
It's just a scratch.

35:53.306 --> 35:55.051
No, come on, I totally
damaged your bumper!

35:55.056 --> 35:56.856
- Don't worry about it.
- Please, I insist!

35:56.976 --> 35:58.256
I'm fully comp.

35:59.816 --> 36:00.816
Wait!

36:06.550 --> 36:08.482
I'd like to report an accident.

36:08.488 --> 36:11.016
All right, we search the canal,
that's where she dumps her bodies.

36:11.176 --> 36:14.295
I want every available unit
searching every inch of it,

36:14.303 --> 36:17.256
that's eight and a half miles,
and we have no time, so go, now!

36:17.456 --> 36:20.256
'Information of a damage-only accident
involving vehicle registered to

36:20.456 --> 36:22.807
'Clare Cartmell in the
last five or six minutes.

36:22.894 --> 36:24.596
The vehicle has left the scene, over.'

36:24.900 --> 36:26.856
Received, what's the location? Over.

36:26.862 --> 36:28.656
'Eastway junction with
Great Eastern Road,

36:28.816 --> 36:30.576
'stand by for further details, over.'

36:31.689 --> 36:34.289
That's the Stratford end
of the canal, let's go.

36:53.843 --> 36:56.936
The others were already
drowning, thrashing about,

36:57.056 --> 36:59.776
dragging society down with them.

36:59.936 --> 37:03.016
Stuffing your face
with a kebab like that.

37:03.176 --> 37:06.376
I mean, that's a suicide
note, really, isn't it?

37:09.936 --> 37:12.176
I'm sorry,

37:12.296 --> 37:14.896
but you're all trying to stop me,

37:15.328 --> 37:16.568
and I'm right.

37:17.576 --> 37:19.176
I know I am.

37:36.529 --> 37:39.216
- It should have been me. It's my fault.
- Shut up.

37:39.376 --> 37:42.416
- I should have gone, not Harry.
- Yeah, and then we'd be looking for you.

37:42.576 --> 37:46.227
He'll be all right. It's
Harry, he's always all right.

38:05.376 --> 38:06.856
CAR HORN BLARES

38:06.976 --> 38:09.136
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Steve!

38:13.090 --> 38:15.936
What the fuck?

38:21.976 --> 38:23.056
Harry!

38:25.776 --> 38:28.376
Police! Stop!

38:40.296 --> 38:42.096
Stop!

38:51.888 --> 38:55.239
- Stop it!
- Why aren't you saving your colleague?

38:59.176 --> 39:01.856
Is he dead? Is he?

39:08.576 --> 39:10.136
Come on!

39:10.256 --> 39:11.856
Harry?

39:13.656 --> 39:14.856
OK.

39:16.336 --> 39:18.296
OK, OK, you're all right.

39:37.672 --> 39:39.532
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

39:41.553 --> 39:45.233
So, look, Steve, we've had
our differences, haven't we?

39:46.309 --> 39:47.669
Really?

39:48.136 --> 39:49.576
What?

39:49.776 --> 39:51.397
"We've had our differences,

39:51.624 --> 39:55.011
but I've developed a grudging
respect for you, Steve,

39:55.016 --> 39:58.016
"and now I, the almighty Harry Clayton,

39:58.176 --> 40:03.376
"have decided to bestow upon you
my gratitude and my forgiveness.

40:03.496 --> 40:05.896
"You may retract your transfer".

40:06.016 --> 40:08.336
Something along those lines?

40:08.456 --> 40:11.493
Almost exactly along those lines.

40:11.499 --> 40:13.256
Yeah. Hey, guess what?

40:13.416 --> 40:16.536
I don't care. I don't care
if you want me to go or stay.

40:16.696 --> 40:19.281
My leaving's got nothing to do with you.

40:20.136 --> 40:22.896
You're not the centre
of the universe, mate.

40:23.016 --> 40:26.016
- I know that.
- You might.

40:26.176 --> 40:29.584
She doesn't. She is a
very good police officer.

40:29.623 --> 40:31.536
You are a bad influence on her.

40:31.669 --> 40:35.052
Look, are you both certain you
don't want a hospital checkup?

40:35.177 --> 40:36.950
Chief, we're fine.

40:37.005 --> 40:38.380
Thank you. Oh...

40:38.466 --> 40:39.997
Oh, um...

40:40.098 --> 40:41.450
I should take this.

40:43.301 --> 40:47.896
So, ah, apparently I owe you
a thank-you card or something?

40:48.056 --> 40:52.016
I'll take the something.
Do you trust me now?

40:52.176 --> 40:54.620
My colleagues were telling
me about this madwoman,

40:54.696 --> 40:56.487
she jumped out in front of their car,

40:56.566 --> 40:58.571
it's a miracle they didn't
kill her, so they say.

40:59.416 --> 41:01.999
As far as trusting you goes...

41:03.096 --> 41:05.496
..I might be getting there.

41:05.616 --> 41:07.256
Well, I owe you an apology.

41:07.376 --> 41:09.012
My little Rui is back.

41:09.137 --> 41:12.656
Poor boy got mugged and
ended up in hospital.

41:12.776 --> 41:14.256
Oh, I'm sorry.

41:14.376 --> 41:16.336
I'll make him all better.

41:16.496 --> 41:18.976
When can I make you all better, Harry?

41:19.136 --> 41:22.069
I can't tonight, I've
got Daisy, sorry, but...

41:22.178 --> 41:26.656
- soon.
- OK, just don't keep a girl waiting.

41:31.096 --> 41:32.296
Yep.

41:50.249 --> 41:52.969
Oh, there she is! Hello, Dais.

41:53.089 --> 41:54.369
Mwah!

41:54.529 --> 41:57.649
I've just been telling
Daisy about digital effects,

41:57.849 --> 42:02.549
about how you can manipulate anything
these days with digital effects.

42:02.674 --> 42:03.248
Great.

42:03.311 --> 42:05.884
And I've been telling Uncle
Rich that I'm nearly 14,

42:05.889 --> 42:07.849
and I know all about CGI.

42:07.969 --> 42:09.649
Sorry, am I missing something?

42:12.249 --> 42:14.609
Somebody posted this online.

42:15.584 --> 42:16.544
Oh.

42:18.209 --> 42:21.209
Right. Can't get away
with anything these days.

42:23.269 --> 42:25.873
Dad, I want you to tell me the truth.

42:27.129 --> 42:28.329
OK.

42:30.271 --> 42:32.071
Is that really a magic bracelet?

42:34.089 --> 42:37.106
Yes. It is.

42:39.089 --> 42:40.609
Cool.

42:40.729 --> 42:42.209
Show me.

42:44.369 --> 42:45.449
OK.

42:47.569 --> 42:50.169
- Heads or tails
- Heads.

42:50.289 --> 42:52.449
Tails. Call again.

42:52.569 --> 42:53.769
Heads.

42:55.169 --> 42:56.649
Tails. Again.

42:58.329 --> 43:01.289
- Bad luck, Dais.
- Dad, this is pathetic.

43:01.449 --> 43:03.849
Can't you jump off a building
into a trifle or something?

43:03.969 --> 43:05.289
Just keep watching.

43:06.171 --> 43:07.451
I win every time.

43:07.876 --> 43:09.037
Oh, and Harry,

43:09.089 --> 43:10.924
another staggeringly beautiful woman

43:11.011 --> 43:13.119
dropped a package off
for you this morning.

43:13.549 --> 43:15.517
_ _

43:23.529 --> 43:25.569
People are dying every day in this city.

43:26.769 --> 43:28.489
Always by accident.

43:28.609 --> 43:31.529
- She is always there.
- How many?

43:31.649 --> 43:34.329
- I don't know.
- She kills them?

43:35.489 --> 43:37.049
She wants them dead, and they die.

43:38.609 --> 43:41.529
She's unstoppable, ever since the first.

43:42.529 --> 43:44.769
The man who killed her children,

43:44.889 --> 43:46.369
what did she do to him?

43:46.529 --> 43:49.129
She nailed him to a
tree and slit his throat.

43:49.289 --> 43:52.169
Woe betide anyone who
crosses Isabella Augustin.

44:01.889 --> 44:04.289
Dad has superpowers.

44:06.529 --> 44:08.969
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I'm
not your dad's Aunt May.

44:09.053 --> 44:10.288
Don't you move!

Oh! Go, go, go...

How well do I really know you?

'She wants them dead, and they die.

44:18.929 --> 44:20.129
'She's unstoppable.'

44:20.289 --> 44:23.129
Your pain, your anger, just
letting it out like that.

44:25.609 --> 44:28.729
If there's anything that you want
to tell me, now would be time.

44:28.889 --> 44:31.689
