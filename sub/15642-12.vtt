00:01.084 --> 00:02.802
<i>Previously on Hit the Floor:</i>

00:02.961 --> 00:05.760
Olivia had something
that would've put me in jail.

00:05.923 --> 00:09.803
I'm undocumented. If the wrong person
found out, I could be deported.

00:09.968 --> 00:13.598
She knew about the oxymetholone,
and that you tested positive.

00:13.764 --> 00:16.563
- That I gave it to you.
- She knew about the coke.

00:16.725 --> 00:19.524
- She knew I got it for you.
- I could've been banned.

00:19.645 --> 00:22.398
She wanted you to back her up
at the groundbreaking?

00:24.024 --> 00:26.948
- Aren't you meeting someone?
- I cancelled.

00:29.112 --> 00:31.706
- I don't need a ticket, I have a Devil.
- Mom?

00:33.575 --> 00:37.205
- What's Oscar asked you to do?
- Make a movie. You, me and a straw.

00:37.371 --> 00:40.921
If you thought confessing your secret
gay life was going to bond--

00:41.041 --> 00:42.668
- Dad, I--
- I don't have a son.

00:43.794 --> 00:47.344
And I've never loved anyone
the way I love you.

00:49.174 --> 00:51.176
I hate you, Sloane Hayes.

00:51.301 --> 00:55.681
I found routing numbers, amounts
and dates. They're gambling winnings.

00:55.806 --> 00:59.106
- We have him for corruption.
- The mike I wore to see the ME.

00:59.226 --> 01:02.070
Olivia knew Oscar had the ME
in his back pocket.

01:02.229 --> 01:03.981
Oscar could've killed Olivia too.

01:05.649 --> 01:07.777
You were digging into Oscar.

01:07.901 --> 01:10.905
That evidence proved
Oscar had Mia killed.

01:11.071 --> 01:12.664
Who did you give it to?

01:12.781 --> 01:15.500
Oscar, you have a problem.
I have the same problem.

01:15.659 --> 01:18.412
And together,
we're gonna make it go away.

01:46.690 --> 01:49.284
Pete. You scared me.

01:49.443 --> 01:51.195
Did you think I was Oscar?

01:53.196 --> 01:54.539
I talked to Raquel.

01:54.698 --> 01:57.918
When an otherwise sane woman
drops a marriage proposal on you,

01:58.035 --> 02:00.379
- you ask questions.
- I was gonna tell you

02:00.537 --> 02:02.505
but you were going through
so much--

02:02.623 --> 02:05.001
He's scum. To rig a season?

02:05.167 --> 02:09.297
To do what he did to that girl?
I don't care what it costs us.

02:09.420 --> 02:12.971
- He is not gonna get away with that.
- No. There's too many people

02:13.091 --> 02:16.311
he can come after,
I can't add you too. I won't.

02:16.470 --> 02:20.520
I'm not gonna sit around and let
this thing play out. I'm gonna help you.

02:27.272 --> 02:29.366
Jude Kinkade?

02:29.608 --> 02:31.610
I'm Detective Ray Harris.

02:31.777 --> 02:33.279
May I come in?

02:33.445 --> 02:36.745
- I'm actually running late.
- This should just take a second.

02:36.907 --> 02:38.750
I was wondering
if you could tell me

02:38.867 --> 02:42.167
where you were at 10:26
the night Olivia Vincent died.

02:43.997 --> 02:47.126
Why are you asking me?
Is this official police business?

02:49.211 --> 02:51.589
It is and it isn't.

02:51.713 --> 02:53.465
Since Chase Vincent's
been cleared

02:53.590 --> 02:56.639
I'm talking to anyone who has ties
with Devils management.

02:57.469 --> 02:59.346
I was on the arena floor.

02:59.513 --> 03:00.890
Alone? That late at night?

03:01.682 --> 03:05.937
I go sometimes to clear my head.
By myself.

03:06.061 --> 03:09.531
But Oscar wasn't giving you
that kind of access to the arena.

03:10.107 --> 03:11.950
I'd sneak in.

03:13.151 --> 03:15.245
It sounds crazy, I know.

03:17.989 --> 03:20.708
I have to finish getting ready
for work.

03:21.535 --> 03:22.832
Good luck.

03:23.578 --> 03:25.171
Thanks.

03:37.384 --> 03:40.638
<i>- HEY-
- HEY-</i>

03:42.222 --> 03:44.645
So last night.

03:44.808 --> 03:46.651
Last night.

03:49.020 --> 03:52.149
What does it mean? For us?

03:52.315 --> 03:54.067
If there is an us.

03:54.234 --> 03:55.781
I never got over you, Ahsha.

03:57.362 --> 03:58.955
I've been thinking about you.

03:59.114 --> 04:01.367
How we used to be.

04:02.159 --> 04:04.161
When we were together, I just...

04:04.953 --> 04:07.126
I felt safe.

04:07.289 --> 04:10.338
I'd try again with you. I would.

04:11.126 --> 04:14.881
But only if you were 100 percent sure
that's what you wanted too.

04:16.047 --> 04:19.017
I couldn't survive another break-up
with you.

04:19.926 --> 04:21.269
Look.

04:22.012 --> 04:25.562
I've been through more in these
last few months than I've shown you.

04:25.682 --> 04:27.059
Than I've shown anybody.

04:27.142 --> 04:29.236
I would never wanna hurt you again.

04:29.394 --> 04:31.067
Think about it.

04:31.730 --> 04:33.448
Really think.

04:34.649 --> 04:38.199
And if you decide you don't want it,
that's okay.

04:40.113 --> 04:41.456
But if you do,

04:42.365 --> 04:43.708
I guess that's okay too.

04:54.628 --> 04:58.178
Were you and Miss Vincent close?

04:59.216 --> 05:01.594
Olivia wasn't close to anyone.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.637
She burned a lot of bridges.

05:04.012 --> 05:05.309
You fired her.

05:06.431 --> 05:08.684
Oscar fired her.

05:08.850 --> 05:10.477
I was simply the messenger.

05:11.102 --> 05:13.196
Messengers have a habit
of getting shot.

05:14.064 --> 05:15.737
Meaning?

05:16.691 --> 05:19.319
Where were you at 10:26
the night she was murdered?

05:21.613 --> 05:23.081
Sleeping-

05:23.824 --> 05:25.167
Alone?

05:25.700 --> 05:29.546
I wish I could stay and help you,
but I have a rehearsal to run.

05:34.459 --> 05:40.717
I hope that whoever did kill Olivia,
that the punishment fits the crime.

05:57.232 --> 06:00.281
Ladies,
we are a game away from a title.

06:00.443 --> 06:04.198
The stakes are high.
The audience will be huge.

06:04.364 --> 06:08.164
This is the most ambitious routine
the Devil Girls have ever performed.

06:08.660 --> 06:13.587
Any waking moment should be spent
making sure it is flawless.

06:14.207 --> 06:16.084
Hit the showers.

06:22.007 --> 06:24.760
You should leave everything
on that court.

06:24.926 --> 06:28.271
Never know when it'll be
your last time dancing on it.

06:28.388 --> 06:31.141
- Can I tell you a secret?
- Do I have a choice?

06:32.517 --> 06:34.519
That's how I dance every routine.

06:34.686 --> 06:37.109
Like it's my last. Thanks to you.

06:38.106 --> 06:39.904
It's made me sharp.

06:40.025 --> 06:41.652
And people have noticed.

06:41.818 --> 06:44.697
Maybe enough to keep me around
no matter what you want.

06:44.821 --> 06:47.825
You could stand to dance
like it's your last time too.

06:48.033 --> 06:50.957
Everyone retires eventually.

07:03.381 --> 07:05.509
You close
any of those endorsement deals?

07:05.634 --> 07:09.639
- Negotiations are taking forever.
- You're still in PR jail.

07:09.763 --> 07:12.357
Gonna take more
than possibility of a championship

07:12.474 --> 07:15.853
to push the boulder up the hill.
Gonna take more than a ring.

07:16.436 --> 07:19.610
If you want your life back,
you need MVP.

07:19.731 --> 07:21.779
You're wound up tight.

07:21.942 --> 07:24.912
Even for you.
Something happen today?

07:27.405 --> 07:28.952
Delivery.

07:41.836 --> 07:43.463
Is this a joke?

07:44.673 --> 07:48.428
- What is it?
- A wedding invitation.

07:48.969 --> 07:50.562
From Lionel and Oscar.

07:52.514 --> 07:55.188
"You're my man of honour.
Look sharp.

07:55.308 --> 07:57.276
Lionel."

07:59.104 --> 08:04.110
"Oscar Kinkade and Lionel Davenport
request the honour of your presence"?

08:04.275 --> 08:06.494
It just gets worse.
What is he thinking?

08:06.653 --> 08:08.951
What is she thinking?

08:09.698 --> 08:13.669
Lionel loves the spotlight.
It's fading because her movie tanked.

08:13.827 --> 08:17.877
She's gonna get it somewhere else.
Oscar does not need to get married.

08:18.039 --> 08:21.509
He swore the only way he'd get married
again was at gunpoint.

08:22.210 --> 08:25.464
This whole thing smells rotten.

08:29.342 --> 08:31.185
What if, instead of a gun

08:31.261 --> 08:33.764
Lionel has something else
that could hurt Oscar?

08:35.181 --> 08:36.854
What if she has my evidence?

08:37.808 --> 08:41.438
I don't know what is going on,
but I'm not gonna be a part of this.

08:44.315 --> 08:45.658
I am.

08:46.443 --> 08:48.821
This wedding is at Oscar's house.

08:48.987 --> 08:51.365
If Lionel has my evidence,
it could be there.

08:51.531 --> 08:54.159
- I'm not letting you go alone.
- Good.

08:54.325 --> 08:56.748
Because I'm gonna need
your help to get it.

09:03.251 --> 09:05.549
So this is what blood money
looks like.

09:05.712 --> 09:08.386
Blood money and a good decorator.

09:08.548 --> 09:12.018
Help yourselves to pre-cocktails.
The ceremony will start shortly.

09:12.135 --> 09:14.137
- Which side, bride or groom?
- Groom.

09:18.266 --> 09:20.394
Relax.
You're sweating through your suit.

09:20.518 --> 09:23.362
Sorry. The last time I was here,
I was being disowned.

09:23.480 --> 09:25.653
Now you're here
as Lionel's special guest.

09:25.774 --> 09:28.152
So special
I haven't even spoken to her yet.

09:29.235 --> 09:32.205
Welcome. I'm a big fan.

09:33.490 --> 09:35.663
I'm a big fan of yours too.

09:35.784 --> 09:37.161
Can I take your coat?

09:37.327 --> 09:38.954
It's a suit.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.622
Or anything else?

09:41.915 --> 09:44.668
He has crabs. Excuse me.

09:47.629 --> 09:50.849
Thank you, Peter, for being
so understanding about Lionel.

09:51.007 --> 09:53.305
You've got great taste,
what can I say?

09:54.094 --> 09:55.846
Lionel and I are ancient history.

09:56.554 --> 09:59.899
I'm with Sloane now.
She's the only person I care about.

10:03.895 --> 10:05.272
- Coach.
- Hey, D.

10:05.438 --> 10:07.657
- Hey, you got a second?
- Yeah, sure.

10:07.816 --> 10:09.534
Excuse me.

10:11.027 --> 10:14.406
I hate to bother you with this here,
but I've got a big problem.

10:15.115 --> 10:18.836
- What's wrong?
- Now, I love playing for you. I love L.A.

10:18.993 --> 10:22.042
But I can't be anywhere
that isn't healthy for me.

10:22.163 --> 10:23.836
What isn't healthy for you here?

10:23.957 --> 10:28.588
The dancer. Kyle. She showed up
at my place trying to get with me.

10:30.421 --> 10:34.051
She's a beautiful girl.
I've looked the other way once before

10:34.175 --> 10:36.803
when you wanted the pleasure
of a dancer's company.

10:37.220 --> 10:39.188
She tried to get me to do coke.

10:39.347 --> 10:41.190
On camera.

10:41.349 --> 10:42.692
L-- It felt like a setup.

10:43.768 --> 10:46.396
I don't know what she's after,
but she needs to go.

10:47.564 --> 10:49.532
Thank you for telling me, Derek.

10:51.901 --> 10:54.029
Okay, I'm sure.

11:03.246 --> 11:05.248
I talked to Oscar.

11:06.249 --> 11:10.470
Better that Oscar be pissed that I got
caught doing what he told me to do.

11:10.670 --> 11:14.641
Than refusing to do it.
Now I just have to wait to be fired.

11:14.799 --> 11:17.723
Why not just quit? Stay in L.A.?

11:18.386 --> 11:22.607
The only way Oscar will let me be
is if he's the one doing the letting.

11:22.765 --> 11:24.608
I hate leaving.

11:24.767 --> 11:28.021
There are still so many stupid guys
left in L.A.

11:28.313 --> 11:30.236
I'm sorry.

11:32.066 --> 11:33.989
At least he'll back off you for now.

11:34.110 --> 11:36.829
Knows you're on the lookout
for anything suspicious.

11:36.946 --> 11:40.541
So I kept up my side of our deal.

11:40.700 --> 11:43.749
A cop asked me about the night.
I said I was with you.

11:43.870 --> 11:46.419
I talked to the same cop,
said the same thing.

11:46.581 --> 11:49.425
Good.
We were together in the trainer's room.

11:51.002 --> 11:53.004
I said the weight room.

11:54.297 --> 11:56.470
That's almost the same thing.

12:05.683 --> 12:09.313
- What do you want, Pete?
- I wanna talk.

12:14.192 --> 12:17.366
- What are you doing?
- I have one bomb under my belt

12:17.528 --> 12:21.249
and three other movies lined up,
all mysteriously ground to a halt.

12:21.407 --> 12:25.128
- I'm grabbing the reins.
- This isn't grabbing the reins, Lionel.

12:25.286 --> 12:28.836
This is self-sabotage.
There isn't a word big enough

12:28.998 --> 12:31.547
to describe how big a mistake
you are making.

12:33.503 --> 12:35.631
Maybe I put myself
on the edge of a cliff

12:35.755 --> 12:38.349
so someone
would have to come save me.

12:38.508 --> 12:40.476
Like I've always saved them.

12:50.895 --> 12:53.774
I'm sorry, Lionel,
but I cannot save you from this one.

12:57.527 --> 13:01.248
Well, then,
the Wedding's about to start.

13:28.141 --> 13:31.361
Tomorrow's the big day.
Are you ready?

13:31.519 --> 13:33.647
Yeah. My phone is blowing up.

13:33.813 --> 13:35.986
Interviews, sponsors.
They're all over me.

13:36.107 --> 13:39.111
It's literally like next-level stuff.

13:39.319 --> 13:41.913
I know what you really care about
is the win.

13:42.071 --> 13:45.666
You've been dreaming about
that moment since you were a little kid.

13:45.742 --> 13:47.619
I want that for you.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.834
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

14:05.845 --> 14:08.268
This is messed up.
You realise that, right?

14:08.431 --> 14:12.026
The fact that this is the first
conversation we're having about this

14:12.101 --> 14:14.149
is a sign of how messed up
this is.

14:14.270 --> 14:15.988
What the hell are you thinking?

14:16.356 --> 14:19.235
This is an awfully short aisle.

14:25.573 --> 14:27.416
You have a beautiful bride.

14:27.575 --> 14:32.581
Sometimes when someone asks you
to marry them, you just can't say no.

14:33.289 --> 14:35.087
You look dapper too.

14:35.249 --> 14:37.752
I'm sorry about not signing a prenup.

14:37.919 --> 14:39.762
My pen just ran out of ink.

14:41.798 --> 14:46.144
Of course. Do you know
what you're getting yourself into?

14:47.136 --> 14:48.854
I do.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.521
Dearly beloved

14:52.683 --> 14:56.563
we are gathered here today
to join this man and this woman

14:56.729 --> 14:59.027
in holy matrimony.

15:04.112 --> 15:06.991
Michael Russell told me
you were the one I can trust.

15:07.115 --> 15:10.039
You were vague on the phone.
What is this?

15:11.577 --> 15:14.797
Just listen.
And be careful who you trust with it.

15:31.472 --> 15:35.147
Here we are in game seven of the finals
and everything is on the line.

15:35.309 --> 15:36.982
Devils get the ball first.

15:37.103 --> 15:40.232
Terrence puts a nice move on
and drives in. A good layup.

15:40.398 --> 15:43.197
Devils are on the board first tonight.

15:43.359 --> 15:46.203
Not too tight! Match up!

15:46.362 --> 15:48.865
- You all right?
- I'm good. I'm good.

15:49.031 --> 15:50.829
Defence!

15:51.284 --> 15:55.039
Coming to the end of the first half,
Boston is ahead by 4 points.

15:55.163 --> 15:56.756
Oh, Zero steals the ball.

15:56.914 --> 15:59.087
Passes to Fahie. Fahie back to Zero.

16:00.001 --> 16:02.129
Nice layup by Zero.

16:03.629 --> 16:05.631
Puts them within <i>2</i> points at the half.

16:05.756 --> 16:07.429
That's what I'm talking about!

16:07.592 --> 16:10.266
Maybe Zero can do it
for the Devils this year.

16:10.428 --> 16:13.853
Ladies and gentlemen, for the last time
on the floor this season,

16:14.015 --> 16:17.019
the Devil Girls!

18:30.234 --> 18:32.737
It's the fourth quarter
of this physical game

18:32.820 --> 18:35.118
and both teams are fighting hard.

18:36.782 --> 18:40.503
Boston has the ball. Shooting for 3.

18:40.661 --> 18:42.129
Nothing but net!

18:46.167 --> 18:48.090
Go, do it!

18:49.003 --> 18:52.303
Seconds left to score.
Time running out.

18:52.423 --> 18:55.222
Derek to Terrence.
Terrence with a nice move. Scores!

18:55.301 --> 18:58.350
He scores.
He puts them into overtime!

18:58.804 --> 19:00.727
Hang on, hang on, Terrence is down.

19:03.351 --> 19:05.729
Hey, hey, hey!

19:10.733 --> 19:12.781
Hey! Medic!

19:12.902 --> 19:15.621
Hey, hey, hey, T, relax. Just relax.

19:15.780 --> 19:17.874
Relax, just don't move.
Just don't move.

19:18.658 --> 19:20.535
Step back, please.

19:21.285 --> 19:23.913
Just breathe, man.
It's okay, it's okay.

19:24.455 --> 19:27.334
- Don't even-- Don't even look at it.
- Hey.

19:29.001 --> 19:31.675
Hey, hey. Hey. You made it, all right?

19:31.837 --> 19:35.467
That was a hell of a shot.

19:37.051 --> 19:39.145
Here we go, here we go.

19:39.303 --> 19:41.226
- Ready?
- Qkay_

19:41.389 --> 19:43.391
- Okay.
- You're all right.

19:43.557 --> 19:44.900
You guys need a hand?

19:48.688 --> 19:53.159
Terrence. Terrence, I'm right here. I'm
gonna come with you to the hospital.

19:53.317 --> 19:55.866
Okay. After the game.

19:55.986 --> 19:57.954
- What?
- I need to know how it ends.

20:00.658 --> 20:02.376
Okay.

20:12.753 --> 20:16.053
Boston's still ahead by one point
in these brutal final moments

20:16.215 --> 20:18.217
of this heartbreaking game.

20:19.343 --> 20:22.893
Yeah, Boston is taking advantage
of Terrence Wall's injury.

20:23.055 --> 20:24.602
Boston to inbound the ball.

20:25.141 --> 20:27.314
Derek steals the ball!

20:28.102 --> 20:31.356
Dribbles to the top of the key.
He's calling the play.

20:32.648 --> 20:35.447
- Looks like Zero's open.
- I'm open. I'm open!

20:35.609 --> 20:38.362
Roman's going in for the shot.
Going for the win!

20:38.487 --> 20:40.285
Derek wins for the Devils!

20:40.448 --> 20:42.166
The Devils win the championship!

20:42.324 --> 20:46.374
Los Angeles has the title,
and the home crowd is going crazy.

20:46.495 --> 20:48.497
Derek Roman
has definitely come through

20:48.581 --> 20:53.178
- for his injured friend Terrence Wall.
- That's our MVP right there.

20:59.216 --> 21:00.718
<i>Hey-</i>

21:01.635 --> 21:03.228
Yes!

21:07.850 --> 21:09.648
Baby.

21:11.103 --> 21:14.903
So how about we celebrate tonight,
just you and me, what do you think?

21:35.669 --> 21:38.013
Look, it's the MVP.

21:38.297 --> 21:40.049
I mean, not just for this game.

21:40.216 --> 21:42.139
The entire season.

21:42.760 --> 21:45.513
He's been there all season long.
It's a team effort

21:45.679 --> 21:48.228
but, still, sometimes
you have a superstar.

21:48.891 --> 21:50.359
Derek Roman's a superstar.

22:12.790 --> 22:14.588
Are you making an arrest?

22:14.750 --> 22:16.673
Yes, we are.

22:18.003 --> 22:19.425
Oscar Kinkade.

22:20.673 --> 22:22.300
You're under arrest

22:22.424 --> 22:25.223
for the murder of Mia Sertner.

22:25.970 --> 22:28.769
Evidence got into the wrong hands.
Nothing I could do.

22:28.889 --> 22:31.017
Evidence from who?

22:31.141 --> 22:33.235
Sloane Hayes.

22:48.325 --> 22:50.578
You have no idea what you've done.

22:57.501 --> 22:59.253
Folks, give us--

23:01.839 --> 23:04.308
I warned you about hiring her.

23:09.179 --> 23:11.181
I'll call your lawyer. Don't worry.

23:17.563 --> 23:19.406
Come on, I'll explain everything.

23:19.565 --> 23:21.033
Sorry, sorry.

23:21.191 --> 23:22.693
- Coach Pete?
- Coach. Coach.

23:22.860 --> 23:26.581
How'd he find out I gave that to you?
You realise what this does to me?

23:26.697 --> 23:28.324
I don't know how this happened.

23:28.449 --> 23:32.454
But I can assure you Oscar will be
going to jail, and you will be protected.

23:32.578 --> 23:35.752
There's no protection
from Oscar Kinkade.

23:40.586 --> 23:43.806
- Where is everyone?
- The team owner getting arrested

23:43.964 --> 23:46.387
for murder
is apparently a bit of a party foul.

23:46.508 --> 23:49.227
His VIP section
was hit especially hard.

23:49.345 --> 23:51.222
He married Oscar and Lionel.

23:51.388 --> 23:55.393
When he said, "Till death do us part,"
he should have been more specific.

23:56.393 --> 23:59.192
Been a minute
since we've been able to talk in public.

23:59.313 --> 24:03.443
Now that Oscar's been carted off,
I don't have to be. Isn't life great?

24:04.526 --> 24:06.779
My problem hasn't gone away.

24:06.904 --> 24:10.158
It's gonna hang over me forever.

24:16.914 --> 24:19.292
- Will you marry me?
- What?

24:19.458 --> 24:21.426
Would solve your problem,
wouldn't it?

24:21.502 --> 24:24.005
It's legal in California.
I'm only asking once.

24:25.631 --> 24:28.475
I promise to cheat on you.

24:28.634 --> 24:29.977
A lot.

24:31.011 --> 24:34.561
And I promise to not let you
anywhere near my child.

24:34.682 --> 24:36.650
Perfect.

24:37.101 --> 24:40.321
- So?
- Kyle, this is crazy.

24:40.479 --> 24:41.947
Isn't it?

24:45.192 --> 24:47.661
- I do.
- I do too.

24:51.156 --> 24:53.033
And none of that.

24:55.119 --> 24:57.338
Sloane,
what did you give to the police?

24:57.496 --> 24:58.793
Just what did you give?

25:02.751 --> 25:04.970
This is a PR disaster.

25:05.129 --> 25:07.973
One I didn't sign up for
when I married Oscar

25:08.090 --> 25:11.094
but as co-owner of the team

25:11.260 --> 25:13.729
I am now responsible for it
in his absence.

25:14.722 --> 25:16.599
He had his choice of a proxy.

25:16.765 --> 25:18.142
He chose me.

25:19.226 --> 25:21.604
Okay, then,
if you'll excuse me, gentlemen,

25:21.770 --> 25:24.489
I'd love to have a word
with Miss Hayes.

25:37.911 --> 25:42.382
Thank you for being so cooperative,
Sloane.

25:42.666 --> 25:45.715
For coming to a wedding
you shouldn't have been invited to

25:45.836 --> 25:49.306
for stealing a microphone
I couldn't have hidden in plainer sight.

25:49.381 --> 25:51.554
And for getting rid of Oscar.

25:52.176 --> 25:53.473
For who knows how long.

25:54.261 --> 25:58.141
I know Jelena gave you the evidence,
and that idea.

25:58.307 --> 25:59.854
She's smart.

26:00.017 --> 26:01.314
I am too.

26:01.477 --> 26:04.196
Smart enough to recognise a good deal
when I see it.

26:04.313 --> 26:08.568
I run point, I shift the heat onto you,
I get half the team.

26:09.318 --> 26:10.661
And what does she get?

26:11.528 --> 26:17.331
I do apologise for not being able
to give you those financial records.

26:19.369 --> 26:22.213
If those had been turned over
to the cops

26:22.372 --> 26:24.500
I would've been frozen out
by the courts.

26:24.583 --> 26:27.928
This way, Oscar rots in jail for murder,
like he deserves

26:28.087 --> 26:30.966
and I get to stay behind
and keep his seat warm.

26:31.799 --> 26:34.769
Well, you can keep his seat warm
by yourself.

26:34.927 --> 26:36.929
I quit.

26:37.387 --> 26:39.810
Actually, you can't.

26:41.642 --> 26:44.191
Oscar's not very happy with you.

26:45.020 --> 26:47.899
I did tell him he's not allowed
to retaliate in any way

26:48.023 --> 26:51.027
as long as you're still working
for the organisation.

26:51.193 --> 26:52.615
If you quit,

26:52.736 --> 26:56.491
well, I can't say that something bad
would happen to you

26:56.657 --> 26:58.910
but I can't say that it wouldn't.

26:59.993 --> 27:01.666
It's ironic, isn't it?

27:02.121 --> 27:04.965
The one place you felt unsafe
22 years ago

27:05.124 --> 27:07.593
is the only place
you feel safe today.

27:08.585 --> 27:11.054
Why would you want me here?

27:11.171 --> 27:13.720
Thank Jelena for that.

27:13.966 --> 27:17.721
If it were up to me,
I would let Oscar devour you.

27:20.806 --> 27:25.061
You'll find out just how tricky
doing business with Jelena can be.

27:26.353 --> 27:28.981
You should really be more grateful.

27:29.231 --> 27:32.906
Not only did she make sure
a murderer went away,

27:33.026 --> 27:34.903
she made sure you were protected.

27:37.656 --> 27:39.329
Not without a price, though.

27:40.868 --> 27:43.291
What are you talking about?

27:43.453 --> 27:47.378
You're right.
There was something in it for her.

27:59.845 --> 28:03.816
Congratulations. Ring number two.

28:05.767 --> 28:08.486
I didn't come here
to be some schmuck on a team.

28:08.645 --> 28:11.569
I came here to be the star.
That's what you promised me.

28:11.690 --> 28:13.408
Instead, I lost everything.

28:13.775 --> 28:15.402
You can't blame me for that.

28:15.569 --> 28:18.322
You were the one who got caught
with your pants down.

28:18.447 --> 28:19.949
On more than one occasion.

28:20.115 --> 28:23.164
You angry about that girl
I flirted with at the wedding?

28:24.536 --> 28:25.879
What makes you think that?

28:26.580 --> 28:30.050
I lied to everyone else but you.

28:30.417 --> 28:32.715
I told you I don't do relationships.

28:32.878 --> 28:35.222
No.

28:35.339 --> 28:37.592
You don't do relationships
with guys.

28:39.301 --> 28:40.894
I do.

28:41.053 --> 28:42.680
You know how I know?

28:42.846 --> 28:46.146
Because I want one, with you.

28:47.309 --> 28:50.654
After the game,
all I wanted to do was kiss you.

28:51.313 --> 28:52.860
And what would you have done?

28:53.732 --> 28:55.029
You would've freaked.

28:55.567 --> 28:59.572
Not because people would think
you're gay or bi or.

28:59.738 --> 29:01.957
Whatever you are.

29:02.699 --> 29:05.919
Because they would've seen
an ounce of anything real from you.

29:07.120 --> 29:08.713
You're so full of crap.

29:09.581 --> 29:11.379
One disguise after another.

29:11.541 --> 29:16.047
You're buried so deep in there,
you don't even know yourself.

29:16.213 --> 29:18.762
You just figured out you're gay
or whatever--

29:18.882 --> 29:21.681
- Not or whatever.
- And you're coming down on me?

29:22.803 --> 29:24.350
You're right.

29:24.513 --> 29:26.231
I'm sorry.

29:27.140 --> 29:28.938
I'm mad.

29:29.893 --> 29:35.696
Mad at myself, mad at this situation.

29:36.108 --> 29:41.831
Mad that I need something from you,
mad that I can't get it.

29:43.240 --> 29:44.742
Most of all.

29:44.908 --> 29:49.004
I'm mad that there's nothing I can do
about any of it.

29:56.169 --> 29:58.137
Where are you going?
You're my agent.

29:58.297 --> 30:00.846
I'm done settling for percentages.

30:01.008 --> 30:05.138
Percentages of my father,
percentages of you.

30:05.262 --> 30:08.687
I want it all.
And I can't stick around waiting for it.

30:11.184 --> 30:12.936
Gideon.

30:15.105 --> 30:16.823
What?

30:20.652 --> 30:24.907
That's my name. Gideon.

30:28.201 --> 30:30.704
I would love to take Gideon
on a date.

30:33.874 --> 30:35.547
To a public place.

30:37.127 --> 30:39.471
And listen to him tell me
exactly who he is.

30:42.841 --> 30:47.722
If you want that,
give me a call sometime.

31:04.279 --> 31:05.781
I've been looking for you.

31:07.491 --> 31:08.993
It's been...

31:09.951 --> 31:12.045
Now I know
why you started working here.

31:13.455 --> 31:16.083
I'm sorry for giving you
such a hard time about it.

31:16.833 --> 31:18.255
I don't blame you at all.

31:18.418 --> 31:20.261
I'm so proud of you.

31:20.420 --> 31:22.172
You're a badass for what you did.

31:23.548 --> 31:25.892
It came at a cost.

31:29.179 --> 31:32.149
Something I have to do

31:32.849 --> 31:36.854
that is cruel.

31:39.439 --> 31:42.613
That I'd give anything
not to have to do.

31:43.819 --> 31:49.201
Because of how things went down,
other people are in charge now, and.

31:50.492 --> 31:52.915
And now what?

31:53.787 --> 31:58.042
Ahsha, I'm sorry.

31:59.709 --> 32:02.713
- You're fired.
- Fired?

32:03.255 --> 32:05.849
I wish there was another way--
I wish I could--

32:30.240 --> 32:31.583
Jelena.

32:32.075 --> 32:33.952
Baby.

32:37.414 --> 32:39.337
You did it.

32:40.208 --> 32:43.428
You took them into overtime.
You won.

32:47.007 --> 32:48.725
It's time.

32:50.260 --> 32:52.183
Please don't go anywhere.

32:54.222 --> 32:55.565
Stay.

32:56.391 --> 32:58.359
I promise.

32:58.518 --> 33:00.691
I'll be right here.

33:01.146 --> 33:02.648
You've got this.

33:20.040 --> 33:24.045
Keeping me in the arena is the biggest
mistake Jelena will ever make.

33:29.132 --> 33:30.930
Hello.

33:34.888 --> 33:36.640
Okay.

33:40.727 --> 33:42.195
Thank you.

33:44.898 --> 33:47.401
That was the lieutenant
I gave the recording to.

33:47.567 --> 33:50.491
They're not just charging Oscar
for Mia's murder,

33:50.612 --> 33:52.614
they're going after him
for Olivia too.

33:52.739 --> 33:55.413
- He confessed to killing Olivia?
- He would never.

33:55.575 --> 33:58.624
Not stopping them from building a case
against him, though.

33:58.745 --> 34:01.464
He killed Olivia
to shut her up about Mia.

34:01.581 --> 34:03.925
Who else could have done it?

34:11.757 --> 34:14.476
- I love this place.
- I know.

34:20.433 --> 34:21.775
Who are these guys?

34:22.060 --> 34:24.904
Derek Roman.
Hail the conquering hero, huh?

34:25.021 --> 34:28.070
What a buzzer-beater. That's the app.
Buzzer-Beater.

34:28.233 --> 34:31.783
Or Derek Roman's Buzzer-Beater.
It can be played anywhere, anytime.

34:31.860 --> 34:33.204
Like "Candy Crush."

34:33.321 --> 34:35.744
Hey, Derek Roman
isn't just about basketball.

34:35.907 --> 34:40.458
He's about strength, power,
just like my all-season tyre.

34:40.579 --> 34:42.377
Thought this was just gonna be us.

34:42.496 --> 34:45.376
Look,baby,
we gotta strike while this iron's hot.

34:45.500 --> 34:49.380
I just had the biggest night of my life
and I chose to spend it with you.

34:49.462 --> 34:52.887
- Not a bunch of parasites in suits.
- Wait a minute.

34:55.342 --> 34:57.094
Derek. What is wrong?

34:57.220 --> 34:59.564
You're wrong. We're-- We're wrong.

35:00.223 --> 35:03.022
I just had the moment of my life.
All you care about

35:03.101 --> 35:06.947
is how you can make money off of it.
Not money for me, money for you.

35:07.897 --> 35:11.117
- That's all I am to you, is dollar signs.
- That is not true.

35:11.234 --> 35:13.202
All I'd do is kept giving it to you.

35:13.320 --> 35:15.368
More and more
to keep you coming back.

35:15.530 --> 35:18.830
More-- More money, more things.

35:19.075 --> 35:20.497
You don't love me.

35:22.120 --> 35:24.043
You never have, you never will.

35:24.205 --> 35:26.082
Derek, you are hurting my feelings.

35:26.207 --> 35:27.880
You don't have feelings.

35:30.045 --> 35:34.346
Someone did,
a great girl who loved me.

35:34.591 --> 35:36.218
And I screwed it up.

35:36.343 --> 35:39.893
I screwed it up because I didn't think
I deserved her. I know I do.

35:40.013 --> 35:41.765
I might be messed up in the head,

35:41.890 --> 35:44.689
I might make a million mistakes,
but I deserve her.

35:45.310 --> 35:47.028
Who I don't deserve is you.

35:50.315 --> 35:51.658
Good bye.

35:53.985 --> 35:55.987
Derek.

35:56.946 --> 35:58.789
Derek!

36:02.661 --> 36:05.380
- Want me to get it?
- Yeah.

36:12.545 --> 36:14.092
Hey, coach.

36:15.048 --> 36:17.676
Derek. What are you doing here?

36:17.801 --> 36:19.178
I was hoping to see Ahsha.

36:19.928 --> 36:21.225
She's not here.

36:22.806 --> 36:26.777
You know, I let her go too easy.
I wanna fight for her.

36:27.727 --> 36:30.822
- I wouldn't get in your way.
- Good.

36:30.980 --> 36:34.200
I mean, you're scarier than he is.
You put Oscar away.

36:34.567 --> 36:36.865
I'm just glad he didn't get away
with it.

36:37.028 --> 36:40.749
Can you imagine,
getting away with murder?

36:49.249 --> 36:50.876
<i>Adrenaline.</i>

36:51.000 --> 36:52.627
<i>Money.</i>

36:52.752 --> 36:54.720
<i>Sex.</i>

36:54.879 --> 36:56.506
<i>Power.</i>

36:58.091 --> 37:01.641
<i>On this court, you can have it all.</i>

37:07.600 --> 37:09.602
<i>When you dance here,</i>

37:09.769 --> 37:11.737
<i>the feeling is indescribable.</i>

37:21.948 --> 37:24.201
<i>And addictive.</i>

37:25.410 --> 37:28.414
<i>Winning a spot on this floor is hard.</i>

37:41.301 --> 37:44.851
<i>Keeping it,
well, that's a whole lot harder.</i>

37:55.148 --> 37:58.823
<i>One wrong move
and you could lose it all.</i>

38:16.085 --> 38:19.430
<i>Ahsha, I keep getting your mail.</i>

38:21.674 --> 38:25.895
<i>This protective mode you fly into,
it's intense.</i>

38:27.180 --> 38:30.775
<i>I've been through more in these
last few months than I've shown you.</i>

38:30.892 --> 38:32.940
<i>Than I've shown anybody.</i>

38:44.823 --> 38:47.793
<i>Some girls learn that the hard way.</i>

38:55.750 --> 38:58.003
<i>And those girls,</i>

39:02.507 --> 39:04.805
<i>they have to bounce.</i>
