WEBVTT

00:02.678 --> 00:04.246
Two days until
trick-or-treating?

00:04.247 --> 00:06.814
What am I supposed to eat
until then? Other food?

00:06.849 --> 00:08.850
I know. Like what? Like, bread?
I don't know

00:08.851 --> 00:10.719
if I'm gonna go trick-or-
treating this year, guys.

00:10.753 --> 00:12.754
All the bigger kids are hanging
out at the old cemetery.

00:12.755 --> 00:15.524
Hi, Jimmy Jr. Are you going
to the cemetery on Halloween?

00:15.525 --> 00:17.526
what time
were you planning on going?

00:17.527 --> 00:19.094
'Cause I'm planning on going
at that time, too.

00:19.128 --> 00:21.430
I'm going when all
the other kids are going.

00:21.464 --> 00:23.899
Oh, cool.
Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool.

00:23.900 --> 00:26.568
But why does everybody want
to go to a stupid cemetery

00:26.569 --> 00:28.737
on a day when you can knock
on people's doors

00:28.738 --> 00:31.139
and they literally
hand you free candy?

00:31.140 --> 00:32.974
And then you kiss them
on both cheeks!

00:32.975 --> 00:34.776
So, just to nail
this thing down,

00:34.777 --> 00:36.678
we're going
to the cemetery together?

00:36.712 --> 00:39.114
Geez, Tina. Everybody's
going at the same time.

00:39.115 --> 00:41.950
We're not going together.
It's a group activity.

00:41.951 --> 00:43.952
Kids go and break
into the mausoleum.

00:43.953 --> 00:45.887
It's a rite of passage!

00:45.922 --> 00:47.756
Mm-hmm. So you think
that's, like, 8:30?

00:47.757 --> 00:49.491
Maybe touch base around 8:15?

00:49.492 --> 00:51.760
I'll just see
you there if I see you.

00:51.761 --> 00:54.596
God, he was all over you.

00:56.632 --> 01:00.268
â™ª Ghosts and goblins,
goblins and ghosts, yeah. â™ª

01:00.269 --> 01:02.471
This year I got the bats
that are smiling.

01:02.472 --> 01:03.705
It's more realistic.

01:03.740 --> 01:05.373
Why is it more realistic?

01:05.408 --> 01:06.508
'Cause they're happy.

01:06.509 --> 01:08.009
It's their favorite holiday.

01:08.010 --> 01:09.845
They love it.
Hi, I'm the exterminator.

01:09.846 --> 01:13.048
Oh, hi. From Hugs Not Bugs,
the sensitive bug killers.

01:13.082 --> 01:14.316
Well, the name is misleading.

01:14.317 --> 01:16.151
We actually use
a highly toxic chemical.

01:16.152 --> 01:18.153
It hugs them to death,
really slowly.

01:18.154 --> 01:20.155
They suffer. I'm Marcus.

01:20.156 --> 01:21.456
Uh, they showed up
the other day.

01:21.457 --> 01:22.657
I-I don't know what they are.

01:22.692 --> 01:24.760
They're weird.

01:26.028 --> 01:27.596
Uh, everything okay?

01:27.630 --> 01:28.930
This isn't good.

01:28.965 --> 01:30.599
What-what isn't good?

01:30.633 --> 01:32.134
This is very bad.

01:32.168 --> 01:33.301
What is very bad?

01:33.336 --> 01:35.570
This is really creeping me out.

01:35.605 --> 01:38.140
You're creeping me out.
What-What's going on here?

01:38.174 --> 01:40.008
Bobby! Is he
squirting poison?

01:40.009 --> 01:42.010
The kids just got home
and they want to watch.

01:42.011 --> 01:44.012
There is definitely
an otherworldly presence

01:44.013 --> 01:45.347
in this basement.

01:45.381 --> 01:46.815
A what?
A presence.

01:46.849 --> 01:48.116
Wait, are you saying "presence"?

01:48.117 --> 01:49.785
A presence?
Presents?

01:49.786 --> 01:51.453
I always thought there
should be Halloween presents!

01:51.454 --> 01:54.189
No, not presents. A presence.

01:54.190 --> 01:56.191
A ghost. There's a ghost
in this basement.

01:56.192 --> 01:57.459
Yes!
What? A ghost?

01:57.460 --> 01:58.960
Who said "ghost"?!
We have a ghost?

01:58.961 --> 02:01.196
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God! Oh, my God.

02:01.197 --> 02:02.531
You need to catch it
and get rid of it.

02:02.532 --> 02:03.799
Like salmon.

02:03.800 --> 02:05.767
Whoa, whoa... Marcus.
Hi. Hello.

02:05.768 --> 02:09.471
Uh, question. Did you say we
have to catch the presence?

02:09.472 --> 02:11.038
Yes.
How does one do that?

02:11.039 --> 02:13.308
First, you got to make contact
with the ghost.

02:13.309 --> 02:15.644
Then you got to try to get it
into a vessel.

02:15.645 --> 02:18.380
A vessel?
Yeah, like a bottle. Or a box.

02:18.381 --> 02:19.781
Oh, a vessel.
Cool.

02:19.816 --> 02:21.850
Can you please get rid
of the bugs first?

02:21.884 --> 02:23.819
Dad! So we get it into
the box. And then what?

02:23.820 --> 02:25.187
Throw away the box in the trash.

02:25.221 --> 02:26.655
Great. Now on to the bugs.

02:26.656 --> 02:29.024
Can you just squirt them
with your thing now?

02:29.025 --> 02:31.426
No way. Those are probably
phantasmal bugs

02:31.427 --> 02:33.061
attracted to the spirit world.

02:33.062 --> 02:35.063
Sure, sure.
Phantasmal bugs.

02:35.064 --> 02:36.898
I'm not going down there.
I got to go.

02:36.933 --> 02:38.934
You cannot be
a real exterminator.

02:38.935 --> 02:40.535
I'm licensed
and I'm running away.

02:40.536 --> 02:41.937
Bye, Marcus!
Bye.

02:41.938 --> 02:43.772
Uh, I'm not paying you for this!

02:43.773 --> 02:45.407
I'll get the Ouija board!
And a box!

02:45.408 --> 02:48.243
And candles!
And some smooth jazz.

02:49.679 --> 02:51.880
Well, the restaurant
is closed. Thank you so much

02:51.881 --> 02:54.750
for not helping out at all tonight.
You're welcome.

02:54.784 --> 02:57.052
I called another exterminator,
not that you care.

02:57.053 --> 03:00.055
So, yeah, just go ahead, do
your capture-the-ghost sÃ©ance.

03:00.056 --> 03:01.356
Mm-hmm.
- All right,

03:01.391 --> 03:02.791
so here's our vessel.

03:02.792 --> 03:04.726
I brought my Easy
Breezy shoe box.

03:04.761 --> 03:06.695
It used to hold the world's
most comfortable heels.

03:06.696 --> 03:08.230
Now it's gonna hold a ghost.

03:08.231 --> 03:09.665
What a life this box has had.

03:09.699 --> 03:11.199
Okay. Here we go.

03:11.200 --> 03:12.934
We're gonna make contact
with the other side.

03:12.935 --> 03:15.504
I just need one more sip
of my sÃ©ance wine. Yep.

03:15.538 --> 03:17.372
If you make contact,
can you ask the ghost

03:17.373 --> 03:19.374
if it's any good with a mop?

03:20.610 --> 03:23.178
Ha-ha. Very funny.
Open the door.

03:23.212 --> 03:26.214
Attention, ghost.

03:26.215 --> 03:27.949
We are gathered here today

03:27.950 --> 03:30.452
to help you cross over
into this box.

03:30.453 --> 03:32.054
Kids, put your hands
on the thingy.

03:32.088 --> 03:35.791
is there a spirit
here in this basement?

03:36.757 --> 03:37.592
It's moving!

03:40.663 --> 03:41.763
Great.

03:41.798 --> 03:43.098
They're in here, too.

03:43.099 --> 03:44.099
Hey, guess what.

03:44.100 --> 03:45.934
You're not phantasmal.

03:45.935 --> 03:47.769
You're phan-dumb.

03:48.805 --> 03:50.939
Oh, my God!

03:50.940 --> 03:52.741
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah! Ooh...

03:52.742 --> 03:54.484
What is your name?

03:54.510 --> 03:56.778
- What's your name, baby?
- Stop moving it, Louise.

03:56.813 --> 03:59.147
I know it's you.
I'm not moving it. It's Gene.

03:59.148 --> 04:02.284
It's not me. Ooh!
Look, it's spelling something out.

04:02.318 --> 04:04.786
J...

04:04.821 --> 04:06.255
E...

04:06.256 --> 04:07.489
F...

04:07.523 --> 04:08.590
F.

04:08.625 --> 04:10.459
Jeff. I just got chills.

04:10.460 --> 04:11.593
How old are you, Jeff?

04:11.628 --> 04:14.463
One. Three.

04:14.464 --> 04:17.132
So the ghost is a
13-year-old boy.

04:17.132 --> 04:18.767
That's interesting.
To all of us.

04:18.767 --> 04:21.470
Jeff, do you, uh, want
to check out the inside

04:21.471 --> 04:23.672
of this totally normal shoe box?

04:27.310 --> 04:29.311
I think he's in
the box! Put the lid on it!

04:29.312 --> 04:31.013
Got it.  Hello?

04:31.014 --> 04:32.681
Did anybody hear me screaming?

04:32.682 --> 04:35.183
There was a crazy amount of
bugs flying at my face.

04:35.184 --> 04:37.119
Bobby, calm down.

04:37.153 --> 04:38.887
We caught the ghost.
His name is Jeff.

04:38.888 --> 04:40.222
Everything is fine.

04:40.223 --> 04:41.723
Everything is not fine, Lin.

04:41.724 --> 04:43.492
We have a horrible
bug problem in there,

04:43.493 --> 04:45.193
and I'm sick of all
this ghost stuff.

04:45.194 --> 04:46.728
Ghost stuff is over.

04:46.729 --> 04:49.464
Now we do the ceremonial
throwing it away in the trash.

04:49.499 --> 04:50.699
No, wait! Don't!

04:50.733 --> 04:51.900
You can't just throw Jeff out.

04:51.901 --> 04:53.335
Ghosts were people, too.

04:53.369 --> 04:55.637
What if it's Jeff Bridges?
Imagine the money.

04:55.672 --> 04:57.039
Tina, what are you doing?

04:57.073 --> 04:58.340
We're keeping Jeff.

04:58.374 --> 04:59.808
You can keep him, Tina,
but you have

04:59.809 --> 05:01.843
to empty his box every night!

05:04.678 --> 05:06.846
So, Jeff, how's your first day
at school going?

05:06.847 --> 05:09.849
purgatory
or the smell in Tina's locker?

05:09.850 --> 05:12.252
It doesn't smell anymore,
Louise; I got rid of the yogurt.

05:12.253 --> 05:14.888
Why do you guys have
an Easy Breezy's shoe box?

05:14.922 --> 05:17.490
I didn't know it was Take
Your Mom's Shoes to School Day.

05:19.693 --> 05:21.761
There aren't shoes in this box.
It's a ghost. Mm.

05:21.762 --> 05:24.431
You're totally lying. And lying
is bad for your skin, thank you.

05:24.432 --> 05:26.699
Why is everyone looking
at a box? What am I missing?

05:26.700 --> 05:29.035
I'm bored.
Somebody explain it to me quick!

05:29.036 --> 05:30.437
It's a ghost.
His name is Jeff.

05:30.438 --> 05:32.238
It's a strong Christian name.

05:32.273 --> 05:34.908
You have a ghost, Tina?
Oh. Hi, Jimmy Jr.

05:34.942 --> 05:36.609
This is Jeff.
He's a ghost, he's a boy,

05:36.610 --> 05:38.545
and we've been spending a lot
of time together.

05:38.579 --> 05:41.014
Ghosts aren't real.
Yeah. Death is the end.

05:41.015 --> 05:42.849
It's final!
That's right, Zeke.

05:42.850 --> 05:44.651
Yeah, nothing more!
High five!

05:44.685 --> 05:46.886
Really? Well, maybe Jeff
will have something to say

05:46.887 --> 05:49.389
about that. Anyone
want to talk to him?

05:49.423 --> 05:50.924
I do.
Okay. All right.

05:50.925 --> 05:53.026
Hands on the Ouija board,
everybody.

05:53.027 --> 05:56.262
You can ask him anything
you want about the afterlife.

05:56.297 --> 05:58.732
All right. If you're real,
what do ghosts eat?

05:58.733 --> 06:00.266
It's moving.

06:00.301 --> 06:01.401
S...

06:01.435 --> 06:03.403
O... U...

06:03.437 --> 06:04.738
P.

06:04.739 --> 06:06.139
Soup! He's right!

06:06.140 --> 06:07.807
Must be real. Whoa.

06:07.808 --> 06:09.642
This changes a lot for me.
A lot.

06:09.643 --> 06:12.045
Are you okay, Zeke?
No, this is weird.

06:12.046 --> 06:13.880
Well, Zeke's changed.
Who's next?

06:13.881 --> 06:16.716
I have a question. Were you
cool when you were alive?

06:16.717 --> 06:19.419
V... E...

06:19.453 --> 06:21.321
R... Y.

06:21.322 --> 06:23.590
Very! Jeff is cool!

06:23.591 --> 06:25.592
I-I don't
think Jeff is real.

06:25.593 --> 06:27.927
Something smells fishy.

06:29.563 --> 06:31.564
Oh, man.

06:31.565 --> 06:33.400
He got you!
Ghost burn.

06:33.401 --> 06:34.434
That's not funny.

06:34.468 --> 06:37.070
Jeff's funny.

06:37.071 --> 06:38.471
Uh-oh.

06:38.472 --> 06:40.306
Time's up everyone.
Wait, wait.

06:40.341 --> 06:43.443
One more question. Hey, Jeff,
do you want to walk me to class?

06:44.478 --> 06:45.812
You go, girl.

06:45.813 --> 06:47.247
He has a creepy crush on you.

06:47.248 --> 06:48.248
Weird.

06:49.617 --> 06:51.284
We have to call
another exterminator.

06:51.285 --> 06:54.287
Let's go with...
"Beetle Kanevil"?

06:54.288 --> 06:56.456
What is wrong with the
exterminators in our town?

06:56.457 --> 06:57.691
Why don't you ask him?

06:57.692 --> 06:59.659
Marcus!

06:59.694 --> 07:02.195
I just wanted to show this place
to some of my friends.

07:02.196 --> 07:03.596
This is Phil and Don.

07:03.631 --> 07:05.198
Hi.
Wait, what?

07:05.199 --> 07:06.800
They're gonna check it out.
I'm gonna run away.

07:06.801 --> 07:08.635
Bye, Marcus!
Good luck!

07:08.636 --> 07:11.338
I hope you don't die!
He always says that.

07:11.339 --> 07:12.605
What are you doing?
What's all this?

07:12.606 --> 07:14.207
Mm. I'm definitely recording

07:14.208 --> 07:16.209
some EMF traces in here.

07:16.210 --> 07:18.945
We just might have something
substantial on our hands.

07:18.980 --> 07:21.848
Are you
paranormal investigators?

07:21.882 --> 07:23.350
Guilty.
I'm Don,

07:23.351 --> 07:24.884
vice president of
our local chapter.

07:24.885 --> 07:27.354
This is Phil.
He's president. Mm-hmm.

07:27.388 --> 07:30.323
Voted in by a landslide.
One vote. It was me.

07:30.324 --> 07:32.559
Uh, you can't do that stuff
in here. This is a business.

07:32.560 --> 07:35.328
So, Marcus told you about
our ghost. His name is Jeff.

07:35.329 --> 07:37.564
Uh, he's doing great. I
mean, he's adjusting well.

07:37.565 --> 07:39.799
I... Bob, do you think he's...
comfortable? Lin, stop.

07:39.800 --> 07:41.568
There is no ghost.
Oh, boy.

07:41.569 --> 07:43.370
Don, you're gonna want
to take a look at this.

07:43.371 --> 07:44.738
Okay.
This booth is covered

07:44.739 --> 07:47.007
in some serious spectral traces.

07:47.008 --> 07:49.009
My meter's going crazy.
Mine, too.

07:49.010 --> 07:51.344
Of course, it could be cell
phone interference. Mm-hmm.

07:51.345 --> 07:53.647
Or an AM radio. Or a microwave.
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

07:53.681 --> 07:55.215
But I bet it's a ghost.
Mm-hmm. Oh!

07:55.216 --> 07:57.484
You hear that, Bob? A ghost.
Uh-huh.

07:57.485 --> 07:59.819
Looks like we got
our work cut out for us.

07:59.820 --> 08:01.554
Phil, you think
we should order some lunch?

08:01.555 --> 08:02.889
Burger. Medium well.

08:02.890 --> 08:04.357
Man knows what he wants.

08:04.358 --> 08:06.726
That's why he's president. Ow.

08:06.761 --> 08:07.994
What's going on here?

08:07.995 --> 08:09.195
Um, nothing.
Don't mind them.

08:09.196 --> 08:10.597
Can I help you?
They have a ghost.

08:10.598 --> 08:11.865
We're here to investigate.

08:11.899 --> 08:14.000
No, there's no ghost.
Don't listen

08:14.001 --> 08:16.036
to him. He's...
Honey, they have a ghost.

08:16.070 --> 08:17.270
Let's eat here.
I mean,

08:17.271 --> 08:18.271
yeah, we have a ghost.

08:18.272 --> 08:19.539
Uh, come on in.
Sit down.

08:19.540 --> 08:21.374
We have at least one
in every booth.

08:21.375 --> 08:23.777
Jeff, people are loving you!

08:23.778 --> 08:26.212
Tina's hanging out with the most
popular box in the school.

08:26.213 --> 08:28.882
I don't even care that he's
popular. To me, he's just Jeff.

08:28.883 --> 08:30.450
Bye.
Wait, wait, where are you going?

08:30.451 --> 08:32.284
Oh, I was thinking
of showing Jeff the butterflies

08:32.285 --> 08:33.919
at the science center. You guys
don't want to come along,

08:33.921 --> 08:36.022
do you? Probably not.
Great. Bye.

08:36.023 --> 08:38.191
Jeff, you have my sister home
by 11:00!

08:38.192 --> 08:39.793
Wait, make that 9:00,
8:00 central!

08:39.794 --> 08:41.628
Jeff and I are gonna watch
Kitchen Nightmares.

08:41.629 --> 08:43.363
That's gonna be our thing!

08:45.366 --> 08:47.534
The butterflies are beautiful
this time of year.

08:47.535 --> 08:50.704
The rest of the time,
they're caterpillars.

08:52.873 --> 08:55.709
Are we holding hands?
I can't really tell.

08:55.710 --> 08:58.878
Jeff, you'd tell me
if you were just a box, right?

09:00.081 --> 09:01.381
You're just a box, aren't you?

09:01.382 --> 09:03.316
I'm on a date with a box.
Oh, my God.

09:04.986 --> 09:07.921
Whoa. I'm getting butterfly
kisses from a butterfly.

09:07.922 --> 09:09.289
Is it you, Jeff?

09:09.290 --> 09:11.558
Is this a sign?

09:11.559 --> 09:13.760
- Oh, boy. You really are real.
- What are you doing?

09:13.761 --> 09:16.596
No, no, no.
No eating the butterflies!

09:16.631 --> 09:18.064
What is in the box?

09:18.065 --> 09:19.232
Um... Jeff.

09:19.233 --> 09:20.066
Who's Jeff?

09:20.067 --> 09:21.468
Oh, wow. Um...

09:21.469 --> 09:23.303
you're kind putting us
on the spot here.

09:23.304 --> 09:25.472
Is he a friend?
Is he more than a friend?

09:25.473 --> 09:27.774
We're just enjoying it
right now without labels.

09:27.808 --> 09:29.643
Oh.
I thought it was food or drink.

09:29.644 --> 09:31.144
Enjoy your visit.

09:33.000 --> 09:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:45.993 --> 09:48.428
Lin, I never thought
I'd say this, but I'm glad

09:48.429 --> 09:50.764
a crazy exterminator
told us we had a ghost.

09:50.765 --> 09:52.599
Big day. People like
your burgers more

09:52.600 --> 09:54.768
when there's a dead person
in the restaurant.

09:54.769 --> 09:56.169
Okay, people.
We're gonna listen

09:56.170 --> 09:58.505
for subsonic metaphysical
phenomena now.

09:58.539 --> 10:01.541
We need everybody
to be very quiet in here.

10:01.542 --> 10:03.843
Except for ghosts.
You guys talk it up.

10:03.878 --> 10:05.445
Hi, everyone! Oh! Ah!

10:05.446 --> 10:07.013
Oh, my. Oh.
Damn it.

10:07.048 --> 10:09.049
We have an announcement.
We're officially dating.

10:09.050 --> 10:11.051
Ooh! Ghost boyfriend!

10:11.052 --> 10:13.486
You'll have to get some
clanking chains for prom. Aw.

10:13.487 --> 10:15.488
Wait. Is there a
ghost in that vessel?

10:15.489 --> 10:17.657
Did you just say
you two were dating?

10:17.692 --> 10:20.527
Dad, you're not gonna like
every guy she brings home.

10:20.528 --> 10:22.529
Mm, I'm getting
some heavy activity.

10:22.530 --> 10:24.931
Of course you are.
It's Jeff. He's like that.

10:24.966 --> 10:26.700
Congratulations, Bob.
He seems great.

10:26.701 --> 10:28.468
Yep. Every father's dream.

10:28.469 --> 10:29.703
Aw.

10:31.038 --> 10:33.340
There he is!
Coolest guy in school.

10:33.341 --> 10:35.509
What's up, Jeff?
Oh, hi, everyone.

10:35.510 --> 10:38.144
Uh, me and my boyfriend Jeff
were just looking

10:38.145 --> 10:39.679
to have a little lunch.

10:41.148 --> 10:43.016
Oh, my God, did you
just say "boyfriend"?

10:43.050 --> 10:44.684
Did I? Oh, yeah, I did. Hmm.

10:44.719 --> 10:46.553
You guys are so cute together!

10:46.554 --> 10:47.988
You're the new "it" couple!

10:47.989 --> 10:49.923
Whoa, people, give
them some space here.

10:49.924 --> 10:51.391
No photos!

10:51.392 --> 10:53.226
Well, Jeff and I
are gonna get in line.

10:53.227 --> 10:54.995
God, just leave him
here for a second.

10:54.996 --> 10:56.363
You're smothering him, Tina.

10:56.397 --> 10:58.398
Let him breathe.
He's already in a box.

10:58.399 --> 10:59.933
Yeah, let him hang out with us.

10:59.934 --> 11:02.369
This ghoul needs some guy time.
Come on, Jeff!

11:02.370 --> 11:04.437
I'm gonna get ya! Get over here,
all right! Oh. Uh, okay.

11:04.438 --> 11:07.007
We'll do our own thing for a bit
and then meet up later.

11:07.008 --> 11:08.408
See you in a few, Jeff.
I'm gonna get you!

11:08.409 --> 11:09.776
Get over here.
Miss you already.

11:09.777 --> 11:11.244
Get your ass up here! Come on.
Careful.

11:11.245 --> 11:13.280
I'm back, Jeff.
Hope you like hot dogs...

11:13.281 --> 11:14.714
Where did Jeff go?

11:14.715 --> 11:16.550
Tammy got some mustard
on Jeff's box,

11:16.551 --> 11:18.351
so she went to wash it off.

11:19.754 --> 11:22.122
You guys, get in here!

11:23.357 --> 11:24.758
I went into the stall

11:24.759 --> 11:25.893
to go number one,
because I never go

11:25.927 --> 11:27.694
number two at school, or at all,

11:27.695 --> 11:28.929
because that's gross,
and Jocelyn clogged the toilet

11:28.930 --> 11:30.230
that one time.
I'm sorry, Jocelyn.

11:30.231 --> 11:31.698
But look what I found
when I came out!

11:33.034 --> 11:34.467
Huh?

11:34.468 --> 11:36.403
"Tina and I are taking a break.

11:36.404 --> 11:38.104
"Tammy, you are hot.

11:38.139 --> 11:39.573
Be my GF."

11:39.574 --> 11:41.408
Wait. What?
Jeff asked me out!

11:41.409 --> 11:44.311
And of course I said "no"
'cause that's not fair to Tina.

11:44.312 --> 11:46.546
Just kidding!
I said yes!

11:46.547 --> 11:48.915
Oh, yay! Oh, my God,
you guys are

11:48.916 --> 11:50.984
the coolest couple in school!
You deserve it.

11:50.985 --> 11:53.086
I guess now I have a hottie
without a body.

11:53.087 --> 11:54.254
Come on, Jeff.

11:54.288 --> 11:56.089
Nobody's saying it,

11:56.090 --> 11:58.225
but Jeff is a scoundrel!
He's buried, not married!

12:03.303 --> 12:04.870
I can't believe

12:04.905 --> 12:06.305
Jeff dumped me for Tammy.

12:06.306 --> 12:07.974
Since when can Jeff
write on mirrors?

12:07.975 --> 12:09.742
I'm pretty sure
that's his handwriting.

12:09.776 --> 12:11.444
It's girly, but it's just
'cause he's sensitive.

12:12.579 --> 12:14.080
The girl's bathroom is nice!

12:14.114 --> 12:15.948
Each stall has a
tiny metal mailbox.

12:15.949 --> 12:18.484
I'm glad I was carrying
around that postcard for Ken.

12:18.518 --> 12:21.020
I don't know how I'm gonna make
it through the rest of the day.

12:21.021 --> 12:22.455
Come on, Tina,
get off the floor.

12:22.456 --> 12:24.590
What's the big deal?
He's not even...

12:24.591 --> 12:26.325
hot... for a box.

12:26.326 --> 12:27.693
That's not what I care about.

12:27.694 --> 12:29.862
I care about what's inside.

12:29.863 --> 12:32.264
Also, we don't know if that's
water or urine you're lying in.

12:32.265 --> 12:34.700
I think it's just water.
Yeah, water.

12:34.701 --> 12:36.335
No, pee.

12:37.704 --> 12:39.138
Tina, they're gonna do

12:39.139 --> 12:40.806
an ultrasound on your box.

12:40.841 --> 12:43.442
The box didn't quite make
it home with us today.

12:43.477 --> 12:46.045
Kids, there's a lot of people
who are very focused on the box.

12:46.046 --> 12:47.413
Where's the box?

12:47.447 --> 12:48.547
Did he switch vessels?

12:48.548 --> 12:49.782
No, he didn't switch vessels.

12:49.783 --> 12:50.850
He switched girlfriends!

12:50.884 --> 12:53.185
To an annoying girl named Tammy!

12:53.186 --> 12:54.787
Ugh! I hate
his stupid ghost face!

12:54.821 --> 12:56.222
He dumped you?!

12:56.223 --> 12:57.790
I'm gonna kill him. Again.

12:57.791 --> 12:59.625
Oh, I knew this would happen.

12:59.660 --> 13:00.860
Sort of.

13:00.894 --> 13:03.362
Spirit appears
to be a bit of a player.

13:03.363 --> 13:05.364
Tina's gonna be okay.

13:05.365 --> 13:06.799
I made her a PB and J.

13:06.800 --> 13:08.534
She said she didn't want it,
so I ate it.

13:08.568 --> 13:11.370
She was still sad,
so I made her another PB and J.

13:11.371 --> 13:14.040
She didn't want that one either,
so I ate it. Anyway,

13:14.074 --> 13:15.474
Tina wants to be alone
for a little while,

13:15.475 --> 13:16.909
and we're out of peanut butter.

13:16.910 --> 13:18.744
Guys, I hate to break
your hearts, too,

13:18.745 --> 13:20.179
but Jeff isn't real.

13:20.180 --> 13:21.447
What are you talking about?

13:21.481 --> 13:22.882
I was controlling
the Ouija Board.

13:22.883 --> 13:24.684
I was messing with you guys.

13:24.718 --> 13:26.819
Yeah. I thought
that was pretty obvious.

13:26.853 --> 13:28.554
I named him Jeff.

13:28.555 --> 13:30.957
It's the stupidest name
for a ghost I could think of.

13:32.426 --> 13:33.893
Of course.
Oh, yeah.

13:33.894 --> 13:35.361
I know Jeff's not real.

13:35.362 --> 13:37.063
It was Louise. Sure.

13:37.097 --> 13:38.831
Wait, so let me
get this straight.

13:38.832 --> 13:40.666
His name's not Jeff,
but he's real.

13:40.701 --> 13:42.535
No, Gene, there is no Jeff!

13:42.536 --> 13:44.236
I just thought
it would be funny.

13:44.237 --> 13:46.572
I didn't think Tina would
fall in love with him.

13:46.573 --> 13:48.007
And I definitely didn't think

13:48.008 --> 13:50.042
Tammy was gonna pull
the same crap as me

13:50.043 --> 13:51.777
but better
with that mirror thing.

13:51.778 --> 13:53.713
And now I'm gonna go tell Tina
and say I'm sorry,

13:53.747 --> 13:55.915
and we're all gonna laugh about
this someday, right, guys?

13:55.916 --> 13:57.717
I don't think
that's such a good idea.

13:57.718 --> 13:59.819
Lin, why is that not
such a good idea?

13:59.853 --> 14:02.421
'Cause Tina's already
feeling heartbroken right now.

14:02.422 --> 14:05.324
If we tell her the truth, she's
gonna feel heartbroken and dumb.

14:05.359 --> 14:07.193
She got catfished by a box!

14:07.227 --> 14:09.695
So... I'm not telling Tina?

14:09.696 --> 14:11.797
You'll see. You'll all go
trick-or-treating tomorrow.

14:11.798 --> 14:13.132
She'll be fine.

14:13.133 --> 14:15.401
She'll be back
to her normal, teeny Tina.

14:15.402 --> 14:17.103
She just needs nougat.

14:17.104 --> 14:18.838
Happy Halloween!

14:18.839 --> 14:21.807
I'm a witch!

14:21.842 --> 14:24.043
Costume fashion show!
Get out here, kids!

14:24.044 --> 14:26.412
Here comes Gene!
Turner and Hooch.

14:26.413 --> 14:28.447
Half dog, half Hanks, all cop!

14:28.448 --> 14:30.349
More like Turner and Cute.

14:30.350 --> 14:32.451
Come here, you!

14:32.452 --> 14:34.620
Oh, here comes Louise.

14:34.621 --> 14:37.390
Shiny scorpion person. Wow!

14:37.391 --> 14:40.493
I'm Ryan Gosling from the major
motion picture trailer Drive.

14:40.494 --> 14:43.396
So violent,
but so well-reviewed.

14:43.397 --> 14:46.599
And here she is,
last but not least, Tina!

14:46.600 --> 14:50.436
Dressed as a...
pretty glasses girl.

14:50.437 --> 14:52.138
Wait. You didn't change at all.

14:52.139 --> 14:53.806
I'm not gonna go
trick-or-treating, guys.

14:53.807 --> 14:55.207
What? No.

14:55.242 --> 14:56.642
You should go!

14:56.643 --> 14:58.177
Eat your candy.
You need it.

14:58.178 --> 15:00.179
Yeah, no, I'm just gonna
hang out here for a while.

15:00.180 --> 15:01.981
And later, I might
stop by the cemetery.

15:01.982 --> 15:04.517
If I don't show my face now,
I'll never be able to do it.

15:04.518 --> 15:06.118
What? Why would you go there?

15:06.119 --> 15:07.687
Tammy's gonna be there.

15:07.688 --> 15:09.989
And a certain
cardboard box. Ruff!

15:09.990 --> 15:12.024
You guys go ahead
without me. I'll be fine.

15:12.025 --> 15:14.493
I'll just watch other people
have fun on Halloween.

15:14.494 --> 15:15.962
That kid's having fun.

15:17.497 --> 15:20.166
Glad Tina's okay. Time
to go trick-or-treating!

15:20.200 --> 15:21.867
Are you kidding me?
Tina is not okay.

15:21.868 --> 15:23.336
Look at her.

15:24.638 --> 15:26.339
I know what we have to do now.

15:26.340 --> 15:28.507
Tammy's going down,
and she's going down

15:28.508 --> 15:30.509
with a strong dose
of her own medicine.

15:30.510 --> 15:32.778
Which I invented! Love it.
One suggestion.

15:32.779 --> 15:34.480
Can we go trick-or-treating

15:34.481 --> 15:36.782
for a couple of hours,
and then see how we feel?

15:36.783 --> 15:39.485
No, Gene!
Can we just stop for ramen?

15:39.519 --> 15:41.487
Ha, all right!

15:41.488 --> 15:43.489
We're the older kids now!

15:43.490 --> 15:45.057
Hanging out in the cemetery!

15:45.058 --> 15:46.826
Man, in a few years,
we'll be parents!

15:46.827 --> 15:48.628
And I have a serious boyfriend.

15:48.629 --> 15:51.197
So, uh, I guess we're
supposed to break into that

15:51.198 --> 15:54.033
creepy mausoleum, huh?
It's a rite of passage.

15:54.034 --> 15:55.468
Hey, we got a ghost with us.

15:55.469 --> 15:56.836
We're good, right?

15:56.837 --> 15:58.070
Jeff, you know the doorman?

15:58.071 --> 15:59.305
Oh.

15:59.339 --> 16:00.706
Hey, guys.

16:00.707 --> 16:02.608
Oh. Um,

16:02.643 --> 16:05.344
you two have, like, zero out
of ten permission to be here.

16:05.345 --> 16:06.879
You're too young.

16:06.880 --> 16:08.147
Yeah, little fetuses.

16:08.148 --> 16:10.316
Hooch, heel!

16:10.317 --> 16:11.984
Where's Tina?
Crying into her butt?

16:11.985 --> 16:13.519
No.

16:13.554 --> 16:15.821
My butt is dry... and strong.
Ew.

16:15.822 --> 16:17.857
Ruff! Good boy.
Hey, Louise.

16:17.858 --> 16:20.626
Tina, I'm glad you're here.
You're gonna want to see this.

16:20.661 --> 16:22.094
I thought you guys
were gonna go trick-or-treating.

16:22.095 --> 16:23.529
And I thought
you guys were gonna

16:23.530 --> 16:25.565
actually go into the mausoleum.

16:25.566 --> 16:27.567
We're going! We're just... we're
just getting our legs ready.

16:27.568 --> 16:29.569
Look, here they go!
We're about to march right in!

16:29.570 --> 16:31.237
Tammy? Tammy?
What? What?

16:31.238 --> 16:33.906
It's so awkward
that Jeff's ex is here.

16:33.907 --> 16:36.242
It's like so... You could cut
the tension with a knife.

16:36.243 --> 16:38.044
No, like, whatever.

16:38.045 --> 16:40.112
I'm so confident, because
Jeff is, like, so over her.

16:49.690 --> 16:52.425
Come on, legs.
Good, great, come on.

16:52.426 --> 16:55.761
Keep going! You can shake,
but you can't quit on me!

16:55.762 --> 16:57.196
I can't see anything!

16:57.197 --> 16:58.598
Whoa.

16:58.632 --> 17:00.066
Someone just knocked
Jeff out of my hands!

17:00.067 --> 17:01.534
You guys don't even care!

17:01.535 --> 17:03.202
I would care,
but I'm too scared!

17:03.203 --> 17:04.936
Zeke, light the
rite of passage candle.

17:04.938 --> 17:07.707
Here you go! I took it
from my Dad's Jacuzzi tub.

17:07.741 --> 17:08.907
Here's your boyfriend, Tammy.

17:08.909 --> 17:10.242
I found him on the ground.

17:10.243 --> 17:11.644
You should really
be more careful.

17:11.645 --> 17:13.412
Great. Now he's
got ground on him.

17:13.413 --> 17:15.548
Sorry the candle smells
like lavender.

17:15.549 --> 17:17.250
Kind of changes the vibe
a little bit.

17:17.251 --> 17:20.051
Yeah. I'm feeling
really relaxed all of a sudden.

17:22.422 --> 17:23.856
The door slammed shut!

17:23.891 --> 17:25.724
Well, somebody open it!
It's locked!

17:25.726 --> 17:27.126
I can't open it!
No!

17:27.127 --> 17:28.560
Oh, no.

17:28.561 --> 17:30.429
Tina, try it again!
I can't budge it.

17:30.430 --> 17:32.064
It just won't open.

17:32.065 --> 17:33.499
Louise, how'd you do that?

17:33.500 --> 17:35.268
I didn't.
That wasn't part of my plan.

17:35.269 --> 17:37.003
Well, then what was your plan?

17:37.004 --> 17:40.006
I put some bugs from
the basement in Tammy's box.

17:40.007 --> 17:42.141
That's it?
Gene, you were there.

17:42.142 --> 17:43.809
You helped me get the bugs.

17:43.810 --> 17:46.746
I know. I just thought there
was gonna be more to it.

17:46.747 --> 17:48.314
But, yeah, no, it's-it's good.

17:48.315 --> 17:49.749
Oh, my God!

17:49.750 --> 17:51.450
Guys, look at this!

17:51.451 --> 17:55.154
"You are all condemned
to eternal damnation

17:55.155 --> 17:56.822
"in here with me.

17:56.823 --> 17:58.658
"This is...

17:58.659 --> 18:00.326
Jeff!"

18:00.327 --> 18:01.727
Jeff trapped us!

18:01.762 --> 18:03.362
Not cool, Jeff!
Not cool.

18:04.416 --> 18:08.474
'Oh, no! Eternal
damnation sounds bad and long!

18:08.475 --> 18:10.509
It's the worst
kind of damnation!

18:10.544 --> 18:12.311
If you really aren't
doing this, Louise,

18:12.312 --> 18:14.313
Hooch is gonna have an accident.

18:14.314 --> 18:16.482
I swear it's not me.

18:16.483 --> 18:18.784
I knew I shouldn't have taken
Tina's spooky seconds! Ugh!

18:18.785 --> 18:21.954
Got her.

18:21.955 --> 18:23.656
Uh-oh.

18:23.690 --> 18:25.291
This might have backfired
a little bit.

18:25.292 --> 18:26.759
They're on me!
They're on me!

18:26.793 --> 18:30.329
Listen! Listen to me!

18:30.330 --> 18:31.998
I have something to say.

18:31.999 --> 18:33.833
We're not trapped in here
for eternal damnation.

18:33.867 --> 18:36.402
- I wrote that.
- What?!

18:36.403 --> 18:38.604
Jeff the ghost isn't real.
My sister made him up.

18:38.639 --> 18:40.039
Dude, what?!
Oh, my God.

18:40.040 --> 18:41.374
That was me.
Uh, hi, everybody.

18:41.375 --> 18:42.942
The bugs were also me.

18:42.976 --> 18:44.810
Part of me always
kind of thought Jeff was fake.

18:44.811 --> 18:47.013
But then, last night,
when I heard my family talking

18:47.014 --> 18:48.381
about how fake he was,

18:48.382 --> 18:50.383
I realized
that he definitely was fake.

18:50.384 --> 18:52.551
Mm. Ah. Also, it's crazy.
It's a box.

18:52.552 --> 18:54.553
But the things we wanted
from Jeff were real.

18:54.554 --> 18:56.555
I wanted a boy
to pay attention to me

18:56.556 --> 18:57.990
and never leave my side. Ah.

18:58.025 --> 18:59.592
Oh, man.

18:59.593 --> 19:01.527
I wanted to believe that
there's more than this life.

19:01.528 --> 19:03.162
I wanted to believe so bad.

19:03.163 --> 19:05.398
It's okay, Zeke.
Oh, God.

19:05.399 --> 19:07.600
It just means take advantage
of the here and now.

19:07.601 --> 19:09.502
Oh, I hear you, man.

19:09.503 --> 19:11.537
And I wanted someone to watch
Kitchen Nightmares with.

19:11.571 --> 19:14.040
And I just liked him 'cause
everyone else liked him.

19:14.041 --> 19:16.342
I need to start
thinking for myself,

19:16.343 --> 19:18.377
unless you guys don't think
that's cool. Then I won't.

19:18.412 --> 19:20.246
And Tammy wanted
to steal someone away from me

19:20.247 --> 19:21.714
because she's a horrible,
jealous girl.

19:21.748 --> 19:23.482
She's right!
Tammy's a handful!

19:23.517 --> 19:24.884
But we don't need Jeff.

19:24.885 --> 19:26.619
We can get these things
from ourselves.

19:26.620 --> 19:28.754
Ah! I don't need a boy
to pay attention to me.

19:28.755 --> 19:30.690
I'll pay attention to myself.

19:30.724 --> 19:33.392
And, Gene, it's okay to watch
Kitchen Nightmares alone.

19:33.393 --> 19:35.528
And it's okay that
I'm jealous and terrible.

19:35.529 --> 19:36.896
No, no.
Fix yourself!

19:36.897 --> 19:38.364
Holy crap!

19:38.365 --> 19:39.899
Tina, you're amazing.

19:39.900 --> 19:42.902
I can't believe
you planned this whole thing.

19:42.903 --> 19:45.037
You-you shut the door
and pretended it was locked.

19:45.038 --> 19:47.273
You came here early
and wrote this on the wall.

19:47.274 --> 19:49.609
What'd you use, by the way?
Hopefully, not paint.

19:49.610 --> 19:51.444
It's ketchup.
Checks out.

19:51.445 --> 19:53.245
Listen, I'm really
sorry I made up a ghost

19:53.246 --> 19:54.614
that you fell in love with.

19:54.615 --> 19:56.215
It's okay.
It was good practice

19:56.216 --> 19:57.750
for when a real ghost
comes along.

19:57.751 --> 20:00.252
Well, you made this
the best Halloween ever.

20:00.253 --> 20:02.154
And there's still time
to go trick-or-treating!

20:02.155 --> 20:03.623
It's 10:30.
It's too late.

20:03.624 --> 20:05.458
Ah, damn it, Jimmy Jr.!

20:05.459 --> 20:07.460
Why do you always
know the time?!

20:07.461 --> 20:08.995
I have a watch.
Oh.

20:08.996 --> 20:10.963
Quick, to the Pacific time zone!

20:10.964 --> 20:14.338
It's still Halloween
in San Diego!

20:16.103 --> 20:18.504
I'll be honest. I miss Jeff.
Well, Bob,

20:18.505 --> 20:19.905
we have a lot of
data to sift through.

20:19.906 --> 20:21.207
We got to get back to the lab.

20:21.241 --> 20:22.642
Let's, uh, close out
your tab here.

20:22.643 --> 20:24.777
You guys ate, uh, 11 burgers.

20:24.778 --> 20:27.647
All delicious. We were about to
settle the bill with you, too, Bob.

20:27.648 --> 20:30.650
Let's see. We did a beta wave
test, a black light scan

20:30.651 --> 20:32.318
and an audio spectral recording.

20:32.319 --> 20:33.953
With all these
services rendered,

20:33.954 --> 20:36.622
looks like it's gonna be a wash.
Bye, Bob. Bye, Linda.

20:36.657 --> 20:38.624
You can't leave. You have
to pay for your food.

20:38.625 --> 20:40.793
We can't pay you.
Mm. Why?

20:40.794 --> 20:42.962
Should we tell him, Phil?
Mm-hmm.

20:42.963 --> 20:44.764
We've been dead for 12 years.

20:44.765 --> 20:46.165
Oh, my God!
Bobby, they're ghosts!

20:46.166 --> 20:47.466
I knew it.
Bye!

20:47.467 --> 20:49.135
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait. Hold on.

20:49.136 --> 20:51.437
Watch out, Bobby! They're gonna
walk right through you!

20:51.438 --> 20:54.273
Do you take credit cards?
Oh, they're not ghosts.
