00:08.597 --> 00:11.237
That body you found yesterday.
It's Tommy Lee Royce's mother.

00:13.224 --> 00:15.863
You're not exactly a barrel
of laughs yourself, you know, kid.

00:15.864 --> 00:18.583
I'm going to a funeral
this afternoon. So is my granny!

00:18.584 --> 00:20.943
You killed my mother,
you filthy bitch!

00:20.944 --> 00:22.983
You're going to get
what's coming to you!

00:22.984 --> 00:25.063
Was it sudden? Cancer.

00:25.064 --> 00:27.823
They're accusing me of strangling
and bottling Lynn Dewhurst.

00:27.824 --> 00:29.103
I'm sorry.

00:29.104 --> 00:30.743
I am sorry.

00:30.744 --> 00:33.223
I'll be fine.
Tomorrow, I'll start again.

00:33.224 --> 00:37.104
No, tomorrow, you'll need another
drink. If you... Will you shift?

00:46.184 --> 00:48.663
I saw on the sheet
that I asked you to fill in...

00:48.664 --> 00:50.224
Oh, the happy sheet?

00:51.864 --> 00:54.264
Yes, the happy sheet.

00:55.664 --> 00:57.623
I saw that on the question -

00:57.624 --> 01:00.423
have you ever contemplated
killing yourself or others? -

01:00.424 --> 01:01.904
you've written "yes".

01:03.784 --> 01:06.383
Do you want to talk about that? No.

01:06.384 --> 01:09.063
Have you ever contemplated
killing yourself?

01:09.064 --> 01:11.623
Have you ever TRIED
to kill yourself? No.

01:11.624 --> 01:14.103
Have you ever thought about
how you might do it if you did?

01:14.104 --> 01:16.943
I've seen all of 'em
and none of 'em are pretty.

01:16.944 --> 01:20.504
They're all...
All what? Sordid. Ridiculous.

01:21.984 --> 01:24.383
And, anyway,
I don't want to be on a slab.

01:24.384 --> 01:26.264
I've seen what they do to people.

01:27.864 --> 01:31.103
Did you have counselling after
your daughter took her own life?

01:31.104 --> 01:32.584
No, I had a breakdown.

01:33.984 --> 01:37.063
What happened? Nothing. I just...

01:37.064 --> 01:39.983
screamed at people a lot
and smashed a few things in the sink

01:39.984 --> 01:41.744
and drank too much and...

01:42.824 --> 01:45.303
...pissed everyone off
within a ten-mile radius

01:45.304 --> 01:47.623
for about a year, 18 months,
and then...

01:47.624 --> 01:49.104
you know?

01:50.864 --> 01:54.423
You've still got to pay the mortgage
at the end of it all, haven't you?

01:54.424 --> 01:57.903
And your marriage broke down.
Well, yeah.

01:57.904 --> 02:01.343
Most marriages don't survive
something like that, do they?

02:01.344 --> 02:02.863
Losing a child.

02:02.864 --> 02:06.104
An experience like that
changes people. Permanently.

02:07.624 --> 02:09.144
I'd have said so.

02:10.383 --> 02:12.064
How did it change you?

02:13.344 --> 02:14.904
I'm sad.

02:18.424 --> 02:21.463
I never used to be sad.
I mean, I could be sad. But...

02:21.464 --> 02:24.024
it wasn't like it was
a permanent state of...

02:29.624 --> 02:31.623
It didn't define who I am.

02:31.624 --> 02:34.783
You don't appear sad. I'm sorry,
I don't mean to contradict

02:34.784 --> 02:37.743
the fact that you are sad.
Only you know how you feel.

02:37.744 --> 02:40.263
But your colleagues,
your friends at work,

02:40.264 --> 02:43.903
I get the idea that they see you
as the life and soul of the party.

02:43.904 --> 02:45.743
Good.

02:45.744 --> 02:47.624
Do you cover things up? No.

02:49.144 --> 02:51.663
No, they all know about Becky,
they all know what happened.

02:51.664 --> 02:53.663
No, I mean do you...

02:53.664 --> 02:55.943
Are you conscious of feeling sad

02:55.944 --> 02:59.463
but still trying to put on a brave
face, your happy face, at work?

02:59.464 --> 03:01.144
No, I love work.

03:03.104 --> 03:04.703
Do you think you're angry?

03:04.704 --> 03:06.224
As well as sad?

03:07.304 --> 03:08.784
Sometimes.

03:09.784 --> 03:11.423
You have an edge.

03:11.424 --> 03:14.583
People are a bit scared of you,
aren't they? Who said that?

03:14.584 --> 03:16.103
It's an observation.

03:16.104 --> 03:20.383
How do you feel about that,
people being scared of you?

03:20.384 --> 03:24.223
Well, it's useful occasionally, if
I'm dealing with something at work.

03:24.224 --> 03:27.223
I often have to deal with people
who are a lot bigger than me.

03:27.224 --> 03:29.904
Are you scared of me? Should I be?
No. No.

03:31.184 --> 03:32.623
Nobody needs to be scared of me

03:32.624 --> 03:35.743
unless they've done something
they shouldn't have.

03:35.744 --> 03:38.583
The second part of that question -
"others".

03:38.584 --> 03:41.623
Have you ever
contemplated killing others?

03:41.624 --> 03:43.743
Does the "yes" apply there?

03:43.744 --> 03:45.583
Oh, yeah.

03:45.584 --> 03:47.064
Tell me about that.

03:50.064 --> 03:53.423
When was the last time
that you felt like that?

03:53.424 --> 03:55.663
Well, day before yesterday,

03:55.664 --> 03:57.703
I could've merrily
strung my grandson up

03:57.704 --> 04:00.103
for setting off a fire extinguisher
at school

04:00.104 --> 04:03.023
because someone bet him
a bag of crisps he couldn't.

04:03.024 --> 04:05.783
So that's me hauled in
and being made to feel this big.

04:05.784 --> 04:07.743
Again.

04:07.744 --> 04:11.103
Then, last Thursday, I could've
happily throttled my son,

04:11.104 --> 04:13.623
who, after persistently
denying anything,

04:13.624 --> 04:15.183
finally admitted he'd had a fling

04:15.184 --> 04:17.343
with his nasty little bitch
of an ex-girlfriend

04:17.344 --> 04:19.623
whilst his perfectly lovely wife
was in hospital

04:19.624 --> 04:21.822
giving birth
to their first child.

04:21.824 --> 04:23.503
So he's a liar.

04:23.504 --> 04:24.984
And then... When was it?

04:26.544 --> 04:27.904
Two weeks ago?

04:29.464 --> 04:32.344
I could've cheerfully
strangled my sister Clare.

04:34.184 --> 04:35.744
She's an alcoholic.

04:37.024 --> 04:40.343
A recovering alcoholic
and heroin addict.

04:40.344 --> 04:42.263
She's been dry and clean -

04:42.264 --> 04:45.863
apart from one or two blips
with alcohol - for nearly 12 years.

04:45.864 --> 04:48.743
Then she fell off the wagon
at this funeral.

04:48.744 --> 04:50.664
And said it was my fault, which...

04:52.344 --> 04:54.543
...it was and it wasn't.

04:54.544 --> 04:57.303
In fact, that was the same day
that I did this thing

04:57.304 --> 05:01.104
that's meant I'm having to do
this business here... with you.

05:35.904 --> 05:38.903
Tell me about Clare. Two weeks ago.

05:38.904 --> 05:42.503
Why did she think it was your fault
that she'd fallen off the wagon?

05:42.504 --> 05:44.823
I thought you were stopping!

05:44.824 --> 05:49.383
I thought we were both stopping,
and then suddenly you're not!

05:49.384 --> 05:54.223
And I'm there on me own,
and I don't know anybody,

05:54.224 --> 05:57.063
except for, like, three people.

05:57.064 --> 05:59.584
And you were five hours!

06:00.624 --> 06:04.943
You said, "I shan't be so long,"
or whatever.

06:04.944 --> 06:08.183
There's no buses up there,
where they live.

06:08.184 --> 06:10.183
Well...

06:10.184 --> 06:13.103
there are might be,
but I don't know where they go.

06:13.104 --> 06:15.983
So what am I supposed to do?

06:15.984 --> 06:18.263
Walk home? Hitch a lift?

06:18.264 --> 06:20.183
Call a... taxi?

06:20.184 --> 06:21.824
Fly?! Clare?

06:23.424 --> 06:25.783
Well, if it isn't our Clare!

06:25.784 --> 06:28.423
How's yerself?
Where you been, eh?

06:28.424 --> 06:30.263
I've not seen you for years.

06:30.264 --> 06:32.063
Spike. Ahh!

06:32.064 --> 06:33.863
Eh, am I interrupting?

06:33.864 --> 06:35.543
No, we were, um...

06:35.544 --> 06:38.383
I'm not interrupting.
Only, I just saw you

06:38.384 --> 06:40.863
and I thought I'd say hello, cos...

06:40.864 --> 06:42.584
Bloody 'ell!

06:45.984 --> 06:47.383
Do I know you?

06:47.384 --> 06:48.823
You look familiar.

06:48.824 --> 06:50.463
It's me sister.

06:50.464 --> 06:52.743
Ah, that's it! That'll be it.

06:52.744 --> 06:54.383
Catherine.

06:54.384 --> 06:55.984
Spike. How do you do?

06:57.184 --> 07:00.423
I thought I knew you.
I thought you were...

07:00.424 --> 07:03.823
There's this copper round 'ere,
she has a look o' you.

07:03.824 --> 07:07.463
She's a right bitch -
pardon my French.

07:07.464 --> 07:09.583
She thinks she's well 'ard.

07:09.584 --> 07:12.263
She did our Aaron for possession,
right?

07:12.264 --> 07:15.223
Nearly broke his bloody arm.

07:15.224 --> 07:17.304
Not you, obviously.

07:18.784 --> 07:21.383
Yeah, well,
happen if he'd gone quietly,

07:21.384 --> 07:24.424
she wouldn't have needed
to show him who's in charge.

07:34.184 --> 07:38.104
It was Tommy Lee Royce's mother's
funeral an hour after Helen's.

07:39.184 --> 07:40.343
Same crematorium.

07:40.344 --> 07:43.023
That's why I left - I went back.
I'm sorry.

07:43.024 --> 07:45.383
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have left you.

07:45.384 --> 07:47.903
I knew you were vulnerable
and I shouldn't have gone,

07:47.904 --> 07:49.743
but that's why. So...

07:49.744 --> 07:51.304
I'm sorry.

07:52.984 --> 07:54.224
You're joking.

07:56.344 --> 07:59.424
You could have said.
That I would've understood.

08:01.664 --> 08:04.463
Was he there?
Did they let him out of prison?

08:04.464 --> 08:06.304
Yeah.

08:08.104 --> 08:09.584
Wow...

09:05.384 --> 09:08.223
Daniel? Daniel?

09:08.224 --> 09:09.504
Daniel?

09:10.984 --> 09:13.463
Sorry. Can you do me a favour, love?

09:13.464 --> 09:15.863
Can you get Ryan
off to school on time?

09:15.864 --> 09:18.023
I've got to get off to work
and Clare's...

09:18.024 --> 09:20.063
She all right? Oh, God knows.

09:20.064 --> 09:23.623
Either way, I can't see her
surfacing much before dinner time.

09:23.624 --> 09:25.863
I'm sorry to ask.
I wouldn't have...

09:25.864 --> 09:27.463
Oh, it's fine, don't worry.

09:27.464 --> 09:29.663
I'll drop him off on my way to work.

09:29.664 --> 09:31.263
Tea. Thanks.

09:31.264 --> 09:33.544
I love you. Mm.

09:38.104 --> 09:40.744
I wish I knew what was going on
with you.

09:42.464 --> 09:45.543
Will you make sure
he gets some breakfast inside him?

09:45.544 --> 09:46.824
Course.

09:53.984 --> 09:57.064
Last but not least,
there was a...

09:58.064 --> 10:00.783
...house fire in a flat
above a shop in Ripponden

10:00.784 --> 10:03.223
reported just after midnight
this morning.

10:03.224 --> 10:04.863
The flat was burnt out, apparently.

10:04.864 --> 10:07.463
The fire officer is telling us
there are several indicators

10:07.464 --> 10:09.103
pointing towards arson, OK?

10:09.104 --> 10:11.943
There was no-one in the flat,
so we're looking for the tenant,

10:11.944 --> 10:14.863
who is a Vicky - Victoria -
Vicky Fleming.

10:14.864 --> 10:16.703
50 years old.

10:16.704 --> 10:20.463
She works on the make-up counter
at Oswald Department Store,

10:20.464 --> 10:22.983
according to the landlord
who owns the shop.

10:22.984 --> 10:25.983
So, Shaf, can you go and see
if she's in work this morning

10:25.984 --> 10:28.143
and what she knows
about what's happened?

10:28.144 --> 10:31.823
Ann, will you go with him?
Right. That's all, folks.

10:31.824 --> 10:33.783
Mind how you go.

10:33.784 --> 10:35.824
Morning, sir. Morning, boss.

10:43.304 --> 10:45.503
Chief Super's coming in to see you.

10:45.504 --> 10:48.744
1.30 this aft.
It'll be in my office.

10:50.744 --> 10:52.344
Pillock.

10:54.224 --> 10:55.704
You all right?

11:00.584 --> 11:02.663
Have you thought about retirement?

11:02.664 --> 11:03.983
No, sir.

11:03.984 --> 11:05.143
Medical retirement.

11:05.144 --> 11:06.864
Why? What's wrong with me?

11:08.464 --> 11:10.704
18 months ago, you nearly died.

11:11.984 --> 11:15.663
My wrist aches when the temperature
drops below zero,

11:15.664 --> 11:18.424
but other than that...

11:20.664 --> 11:22.863
A thing like that takes its toll

11:22.864 --> 11:25.463
mentally as well as physically,
Catherine.

11:25.464 --> 11:28.583
We did go some way down the medical
retirement route last time.

11:28.584 --> 11:32.423
Yeah, and it weren't what I wanted
then, and it isn't what I want now.

11:32.424 --> 11:33.744
Sir.

11:36.624 --> 11:40.423
It would appear to me
that you have unresolved issues,

11:40.424 --> 11:43.143
which is why you turned up
at that funeral yesterday -

11:43.144 --> 11:46.263
a funeral which you and me
both know, for 1,001 reasons,

11:46.264 --> 11:48.704
you shouldn't have been
anywhere near.

11:50.104 --> 11:53.944
You were offered counselling when
you left hospital 18 months ago.

11:55.464 --> 11:57.103
Yeah. Did you go?

11:57.104 --> 11:58.383
Yeah.

11:58.384 --> 12:00.984
Did you complete
the course of treatment?

12:04.424 --> 12:08.503
OK. I'm giving you options,
Catherine. Two options.

12:08.504 --> 12:10.663
I'd like you to see
the force psychologist.

12:10.664 --> 12:11.743
I'd like you to complete

12:11.744 --> 12:14.023
whatever course of treatment
he suggests to you.

12:14.024 --> 12:15.623
Or the alternative -

12:15.624 --> 12:19.103
and I do think it's something
you should consider...

12:19.104 --> 12:21.823
Seriously, you've had a long
and distinguished career,

12:21.824 --> 12:24.983
you're a highly respected officer
who's suffered a major trauma.

12:24.984 --> 12:27.743
Why don't I have a case conference
with HR to take things forward

12:27.744 --> 12:30.463
down the medical retirement route?
You're not doing that to me.

12:30.464 --> 12:32.663
There is no stigma attached.
You'd...

12:32.664 --> 12:34.583
You'd retire on a full pension...

12:34.584 --> 12:37.103
Yeah, and I'd miss
the next three years' salary.

12:37.104 --> 12:39.424
Well, do you want to think about it?
No.

12:40.784 --> 12:43.224
Fine.
So you'll take the first option.

12:44.824 --> 12:47.663
You'll see the force psychologist,
you'll remain operational,

12:47.664 --> 12:49.583
but, this time, you will complete

12:49.584 --> 12:52.424
whatever course of treatment
he suggests to you.

12:56.144 --> 12:59.864
And has Clare managed to stay dry
during the last two weeks?

13:01.984 --> 13:04.503
It's early days. But, er...

13:04.504 --> 13:07.863
yeah. It was a lapse,
it shook her more than anyone.

13:07.864 --> 13:10.823
She's been at
every AA meeting going since.

13:10.824 --> 13:13.544
They do all sorts -
they have a jive class...

13:15.584 --> 13:17.704
She goes with this new boyfriend.

13:18.984 --> 13:21.503
What about Daniel?

13:21.504 --> 13:23.103
God knows.

13:23.104 --> 13:24.824
And Ryan?

13:26.144 --> 13:28.703
Well, he can be fine for weeks.
But...

13:28.704 --> 13:31.303
you never know
when the phone's going to go,

13:31.304 --> 13:32.703
and it'll be Mrs Beresford -

13:32.704 --> 13:35.703
"You're going to have to come in
and fetch him." So...

13:35.704 --> 13:37.303
You have a lot on.

13:37.304 --> 13:40.423
Ah, no more than most people my age,
I suspect.

13:40.424 --> 13:43.863
You did something very selfless
when you took Ryan on.

13:43.864 --> 13:46.743
There must have been times
when you've struggled with it.

13:46.744 --> 13:48.183
Well, I don't dwell on it.

13:48.184 --> 13:51.144
I've always focused on the fact
that it isn't his fault.

13:53.584 --> 13:55.944
Tell me about Tommy Lee Royce.

13:58.744 --> 14:00.503
What about him?

14:00.504 --> 14:02.504
What took you to the funeral?

14:11.664 --> 14:14.823
I have a friend
who's scared of birds.

14:14.824 --> 14:16.463
It's a proper phobia.

14:16.464 --> 14:19.024
And, um, one day, this peacock...

14:20.064 --> 14:22.943
...came and sat just outside
her front door.

14:22.944 --> 14:26.543
I've no idea where it came from,
but it just sat there for hours.

14:26.544 --> 14:29.463
And she didn't dare go out,
and her husband was at work,

14:29.464 --> 14:31.903
and she said she felt
too stupid to ring anyone.

14:31.904 --> 14:35.983
So she just stared at it through
the sitting room window for hours

14:35.984 --> 14:37.823
till it left,

14:37.824 --> 14:39.504
and I said, "Why?"

14:40.864 --> 14:43.064
And she said,
"So I knew where it was."

14:44.744 --> 14:47.383
So maybe that's it,
maybe that's all it was.

14:47.384 --> 14:48.744
I just...

14:50.704 --> 14:54.344
...wanted to make sure I knew where
he was till he was back inside.

14:57.304 --> 14:59.224
Going back to the question...

15:00.504 --> 15:03.863
...have you ever contemplated
killing yourself or others?

15:03.864 --> 15:06.704
What about him, Tommy Lee Royce?

15:08.464 --> 15:11.223
My daughter died because of him.
What do you think?

15:11.224 --> 15:13.024
Tell me about that. Look...

15:16.584 --> 15:18.423
...if I'd really wanted to kill him,

15:18.424 --> 15:21.263
I could've done on that narrow boat,
18 months since.

15:21.264 --> 15:23.143
I had him on the floor,
he was helpless,

15:23.144 --> 15:25.543
I could have kicked the stuffing out
of him, but I didn't.

15:25.544 --> 15:27.423
What I actually did
was douse him in foam

15:27.424 --> 15:29.063
so he couldn't set fire to himself.

15:29.064 --> 15:30.943
When it came to it,
when the chips were down,

15:30.944 --> 15:32.863
my instinct
was to do the right thing.

15:32.864 --> 15:35.824
And do you regret that? No.

15:38.104 --> 15:39.584
How was it?

15:41.024 --> 15:42.303
That bad?

15:42.304 --> 15:44.423
You just hear yourself talking wank.

15:44.424 --> 15:47.503
Dripping off the ceiling
and crawling down the walls.

15:47.504 --> 15:49.743
The room's so full of it
by the time you've finished,

15:49.744 --> 15:52.303
you've to wade through it
in your wellies to get out.

15:52.304 --> 15:53.823
Do you fancy a drink tonight?

15:53.824 --> 15:56.144
You fancy going out
for something to eat?

15:58.784 --> 16:00.543
Yeah, actually. That'd be nice.

16:00.544 --> 16:02.343
My treat. Why?

16:02.344 --> 16:05.023
Cos I feel like chucking
me brass about. Ooh...

16:05.024 --> 16:06.903
OK.

16:06.904 --> 16:08.584
And in other news... What?

16:10.304 --> 16:13.263
...they think they've found
another body.

16:13.264 --> 16:16.984
Where? Going over to Brighouse
again. Same as first one.

16:32.024 --> 16:35.863
There's been nothing found
at the scene to identify who she is.

16:35.864 --> 16:38.503
What we know at the moment is
she's white,

16:38.504 --> 16:40.823
she's 5ft 4in, slight build.

16:40.824 --> 16:43.263
She's got blonde,
shoulder-length hair.

16:43.264 --> 16:46.783
Shoe size - 5.
She's between 30 and 60 years old.

16:46.784 --> 16:49.943
So we need to check all the mispers
locally, force wide,

16:49.944 --> 16:51.863
and then moving out force by force,

16:51.864 --> 16:55.063
going back, I'd say...
four weeks, initially.

16:55.064 --> 16:56.543
CCTV in the area -

16:56.544 --> 17:00.103
may be limited, but
I'd like to see what we can gather.

17:00.104 --> 17:02.703
As you go in,
it says the site's covered,

17:02.704 --> 17:04.623
but I didn't see any cameras.

17:04.624 --> 17:07.424
Again, I'd say going back
four weeks.

17:08.944 --> 17:11.823
There are a number of houses
opposite and along.

17:11.824 --> 17:16.502
Jubilee Terrace, numbers 35 to 75
overlook the site to some degree.

17:16.503 --> 17:18.903
We need to speak
to all the occupants.

17:18.904 --> 17:21.303
The number 259 and number 278 buses

17:21.304 --> 17:23.383
go past the site
on the Halifax Road.

17:23.384 --> 17:25.823
Somebody may have seen something
from a top window.

17:25.824 --> 17:28.463
Let's visit the garages those
buses drive out of,

17:28.464 --> 17:31.463
see if they have specific drivers
who drive those routes regularly,

17:31.464 --> 17:33.583
any regular passengers
who travel upstairs.

17:33.584 --> 17:35.023
I'll include in the press release

17:35.024 --> 17:37.503
an appeal to anyone
who uses either of those two buses,

17:37.504 --> 17:40.423
as well as anyone who travels
up and down that road regularly.

17:40.424 --> 17:42.863
Are we looking at the same killer,
do you think, sir?

17:42.864 --> 17:45.303
Er, she appears
to have been strangled,

17:45.304 --> 17:47.823
and there's vaginal mutilation
of the same nature

17:47.824 --> 17:50.623
as our previous three women.
So, um...

17:50.624 --> 17:54.343
Yeah. John! Can you come and do
exhibits for me at the postmortem?

17:54.344 --> 17:56.623
Emma's had to go to the dentist.

17:56.624 --> 17:58.023
S-Sure.

17:58.024 --> 18:00.664
Ten minutes, yeah?
I'll meet you downstairs.

18:04.144 --> 18:07.183
John? Boss is looking for you, mate.
He's ready to go.

18:07.184 --> 18:08.464
OK.

18:13.344 --> 18:14.823
(Hey.)

18:14.824 --> 18:18.743
Now? No, no problem.
I'll pop back upstairs. Um...

18:18.744 --> 18:21.944
Two minutes. Get the car started.
Yeah...

18:24.144 --> 18:26.543
Is it true another body's turned up?

18:26.544 --> 18:28.663
Er, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it is.

18:28.664 --> 18:30.663
Is it the same? Another...?

18:30.664 --> 18:32.943
Someone who's been trafficked?

18:32.944 --> 18:35.703
Well, yeah,
starting to look that way.

18:35.704 --> 18:37.584
I shouldn't be asking.

18:39.064 --> 18:40.183
John!

18:40.184 --> 18:41.943
You all right?

18:41.944 --> 18:42.984
Yeah!

18:44.184 --> 18:45.863
Yeah... No.

18:45.864 --> 18:47.104
Not really.

18:55.264 --> 18:57.303
Turns out my wife's
been having it off

18:57.304 --> 18:59.383
with this bastard she works with.

18:59.384 --> 19:01.423
Jesus. Shit!

19:01.424 --> 19:04.063
I'd been working on obs, so
she thought I was away all night,

19:04.064 --> 19:07.183
which I was, but then they got
called off, so I went home. And...

19:07.184 --> 19:08.864
there they were.

19:11.584 --> 19:13.703
I've not told anyone.

19:13.704 --> 19:15.103
God...

19:15.104 --> 19:16.784
that's rough.

19:17.904 --> 19:19.423
When?

19:19.424 --> 19:21.023
Two weeks since.

19:21.024 --> 19:23.063
Fella she's known for years.

19:23.064 --> 19:25.984
With t'kids in the house and all!

19:27.224 --> 19:29.064
He's married, he's got kids.

19:30.464 --> 19:32.463
That's crap.

19:32.464 --> 19:34.544
Yeah. So...

19:36.144 --> 19:37.543
Anyway...

19:37.544 --> 19:39.343
I'm really sorry, John.

19:39.344 --> 19:40.864
Not your fault.

19:42.584 --> 19:45.423
Do you want to go for a drink
some time?

19:45.424 --> 19:46.463
Um...

19:46.464 --> 19:48.103
Sorry. Is that inappropriate?

19:48.104 --> 19:49.983
Going for a drink? Asking.

19:49.984 --> 19:53.024
Oh, is it? I don't...
I'm sorry... When?

19:54.744 --> 19:56.623
Any time. OK.

19:56.624 --> 19:58.463
Really? Not tonight.

19:58.464 --> 20:00.943
No. But...
Yeah? ..maybe... Yeah, whenever.

20:00.944 --> 20:03.184
...later in the... Yeah... week.

20:04.904 --> 20:06.703
Where are you off?
Anywhere exciting?

20:06.704 --> 20:08.903
Postmortem.

20:08.904 --> 20:11.824
What, the victim's postmortem?

21:09.704 --> 21:11.384
Asphyxiation.

21:13.824 --> 21:16.864
Hyoid bone possibly broken.

21:19.464 --> 21:21.704
I'll show you when I open her up.

21:23.064 --> 21:25.223
You're hurting me!
You shouldn't have done it!

21:25.224 --> 21:26.584
'John?'

21:27.744 --> 21:28.863
John?

21:28.864 --> 21:30.223
Nails.

21:30.224 --> 21:33.104
Nails. Sorry, yeah.

21:35.704 --> 21:39.504
So, we're looking at vaginal
bruising and lacerations.

21:41.664 --> 21:43.864
Are you all right?

21:46.904 --> 21:48.863
Yeah, yeah, yeah, erm...

21:48.864 --> 21:51.544
It's just I haven't done
one of these for a while

22:01.504 --> 22:04.503
So, how many times do you
have to go?

22:04.504 --> 22:06.823
Six. Including today.

22:06.824 --> 22:08.744
He assesses me...

22:10.424 --> 22:12.703
...then he makes recommendations.

22:12.704 --> 22:15.983
Who to?
What sort of recommendations?

22:15.984 --> 22:18.464
Maybe they're going
to have me put down.

22:20.544 --> 22:22.943
Have you ever been?

22:22.944 --> 22:25.863
Uh-uh. Have you ever done
owt like that?

22:25.864 --> 22:27.303
He leaves gaps.

22:27.304 --> 22:29.023
We sit there in silence.

22:29.024 --> 22:31.543
I think he relies on the idea
that nature abhors a vacuum,

22:31.544 --> 22:34.783
so if we sit there long enough,
I'll feel obliged to fill it with...

22:34.784 --> 22:36.984
shite. So I do.

22:39.944 --> 22:42.424
Is it, though? Shite?

22:44.864 --> 22:46.463
Some of it.

22:46.464 --> 22:49.223
Look, if I'd really wanted to
kill him, I could've done.

22:49.224 --> 22:50.903
I had him on the floor,
he was helpless,

22:50.904 --> 22:52.903
I could've kicked
the stuffing out of him.

22:52.904 --> 22:55.263
But I didn't. What I actually did
was douse him in foam

22:55.264 --> 22:57.063
so he couldn't set fire to himself.

22:57.064 --> 22:59.183
Do you regret that? No.

22:59.184 --> 23:00.823
Course I regret it! The only reason

23:00.824 --> 23:03.343
I didn't kick the shit out of him
was because he wanted me to.

23:03.344 --> 23:04.463
"Kill me, kill me!"

23:04.464 --> 23:07.223
"Piss off, you little turd,
I'm not doing owt you want."

23:07.224 --> 23:09.703
I neglected to mention that,
after I'd doused him in foam,

23:09.704 --> 23:12.383
I did indeed endeavour to kick
the living daylights out of him.

23:12.384 --> 23:15.103
But sadly that - whoever she was -
policewoman went and waded in

23:15.104 --> 23:17.983
and pulled me off him. Bitch.

23:17.984 --> 23:21.983
Well, I'm glad you didn't kill him,
for what it's worth,

23:21.984 --> 23:24.623
cos then you'd have been in even
more bloody trouble.

23:24.624 --> 23:27.263
Yeah, but that's what bothers me.
I don't think I would have.

23:27.264 --> 23:29.383
I think I could have probably
got away with it,

23:29.384 --> 23:30.583
one way and another. Oh...

23:30.584 --> 23:32.703
You weren't there.
He was nearly dead anyway.

23:32.704 --> 23:35.143
He was in a bloody bad way.
You're better than that.

23:35.144 --> 23:36.303
No, I'm not.

23:36.304 --> 23:37.503
Have you done, ladies?

23:37.504 --> 23:39.144
Yeah, I have.

23:41.024 --> 23:43.423
What time's
Michael Jackson coming on, then?

23:43.424 --> 23:47.143
Oh, any time now. Sorry,
have you been waiting for him?

23:47.144 --> 23:49.343
Thing is, it takes him
half an hour to get ready,

23:49.344 --> 23:51.863
with his make-up
and his psyching himself up.

23:51.864 --> 23:53.223
Is he any good?

23:53.224 --> 23:55.343
He's... You know.

23:55.344 --> 23:57.943
But we had Robbie Williams here
two weeks ago

23:57.944 --> 23:59.623
and he were... all right.

23:59.624 --> 24:03.023
Oh, and then we've got Elvis
back again week after next.

24:03.024 --> 24:04.823
Did you see Elvis last time?

24:04.824 --> 24:08.103
Cos we did have him here...
Oh, six months back?

24:08.104 --> 24:10.784
And he's... not bad, either.

24:14.864 --> 24:17.583
D'you know what really pissed me
off when I saw him

24:17.584 --> 24:18.943
was how well he looked?

24:18.944 --> 24:21.943
He's obviously been looking
after himself inside.

24:21.944 --> 24:24.103
Narcissistic twat.

24:24.104 --> 24:26.903
I think maybe I was hoping
he'd gone down the Swanee

24:26.904 --> 24:29.823
and that he was getting beaten up
and buggered around. Maybe he is.

24:29.824 --> 24:31.383
You don't know.

24:31.384 --> 24:34.063
He'll have 'em all wrapped
round his little finger.

24:34.064 --> 24:37.543
Why would he? Running round in
little circles, wetting themselves.

24:37.544 --> 24:40.223
Why would he? Oh, just...

24:40.224 --> 24:42.183
I bet he gets letters.

24:42.184 --> 24:44.823
I bet there's a string of deluded
mad bitches in love with him

24:44.824 --> 24:46.583
who want to introduce him to Jesus.

24:46.584 --> 24:48.103
Yeah, well, either way,

24:48.104 --> 24:50.663
there's nowt cushy
about Gravesend Prison.

24:50.664 --> 24:52.463
You did a great job, Catherine.

24:52.464 --> 24:54.543
Death would've been too kind.

24:54.544 --> 24:56.864
What you did to him was perfect.

24:59.424 --> 25:02.223
Hey, have you alibied yourself yet?

25:02.224 --> 25:03.903
Don't you start.

25:03.904 --> 25:06.143
Well, have you? No, have you?

25:06.144 --> 25:07.823
No.

25:07.824 --> 25:09.983
Why not? Why not?!

25:09.984 --> 25:12.423
I can't! I've checked everything -

25:12.424 --> 25:15.383
my calendar, my smart book,
my day book, the roster.

25:15.384 --> 25:18.463
I mean, I don't care, I don't give
a toss. I know I didn't do it.

25:18.464 --> 25:20.863
Have you asked everybody else
to check all their doings?

25:20.864 --> 25:23.903
What good will that do?
Well, it might jog someone's memory.

25:23.904 --> 25:27.463
You give me the dates
and I'll ask around.

25:27.464 --> 25:29.103
Right.

25:29.104 --> 25:30.743
Go on, then.

25:30.744 --> 25:32.543
I'll text 'em to you. When?

25:32.544 --> 25:33.783
Tomorrow.

25:33.784 --> 25:35.423
You'll forget.

25:35.424 --> 25:36.943
You can remind me.

25:36.944 --> 25:38.823
Do it when you get in. What, now?

25:38.824 --> 25:41.944
Ooh, here he comes!
My knight in shining armour. Billy!

25:43.464 --> 25:47.224
Has he seen me? Big nelly's
lost his glasses again.

25:49.144 --> 25:51.183
He's got a tail-light out.

25:51.184 --> 25:52.904
Oh, yeah, I'll tell him.

25:55.064 --> 25:56.903
Come here.

25:56.904 --> 25:58.623
Night-night, sweetheart.

25:58.624 --> 26:01.264
Text me as soon as you get in.
Night.

26:03.584 --> 26:05.024
Hey!

26:06.184 --> 26:09.103
Why are you so bothered about
me alibi-ing myself?

26:09.104 --> 26:10.783
Cos I care about you.

26:10.784 --> 26:12.583
Has Mike Taylor been on at you?

26:12.584 --> 26:13.943
No. Has he?

26:13.944 --> 26:15.344
No! Has he?

26:16.704 --> 26:18.823
Cos I know he's been canvassing
opinion about me

26:18.824 --> 26:20.063
and passing it on to Praveen

26:20.064 --> 26:21.543
cos of things this therapist said

26:21.544 --> 26:23.383
about what my colleagues
think of me.

26:23.384 --> 26:26.064
Like the high esteem
everybody holds you in?

26:27.984 --> 26:30.463
You better not go telling him
stuff I've said this evening

26:30.464 --> 26:33.343
about that twat,
cos I'll know if you have.

26:33.344 --> 26:34.983
Do you think I would?

26:34.984 --> 26:36.743
Do you think I would do that?

26:36.744 --> 26:38.704
No, I'm just saying.

26:39.824 --> 26:43.223
So...
Sorry, are you threatening me?

26:43.224 --> 26:45.824
No. No, I'm just saying.

26:47.904 --> 26:51.264
You don't need to text them dates.
I was only trying to help.

26:53.664 --> 26:56.024
All right. Right.

27:01.984 --> 27:03.944
Night-night, then.

27:14.744 --> 27:16.624
Night.

27:22.104 --> 27:25.023
She was asphyxiated with quite
a narrow ligature,

27:25.024 --> 27:27.583
looking at the bruising
on the muscle.

27:27.584 --> 27:29.824
Something like an electrical cable.

27:31.104 --> 27:33.023
The grazing on the right knee

27:33.024 --> 27:36.143
happened, I would imagine,
during the struggle.

27:36.144 --> 27:38.223
She was alive when it happened.

27:38.224 --> 27:39.943
She was already dead, though,

27:39.944 --> 27:42.343
when the internal vaginal
injuries were inflicted.

27:42.344 --> 27:45.304
Can you be any more
specific about her age?

27:46.504 --> 27:49.143
Her internal organs
are healthy enough.

27:49.144 --> 27:51.783
She wasn't a drinker,
she didn't smoke.

27:51.784 --> 27:53.583
Never given birth.

27:53.584 --> 27:55.703
Teeth are in good condition, so...

27:55.704 --> 27:59.103
So, not what you'd think of as
a typical prostitute lifestyle?

27:59.104 --> 28:02.143
She's maybe 45 to 55.

28:02.144 --> 28:04.063
Could she be Eastern European?

28:04.064 --> 28:05.543
No. British dental work.

28:05.544 --> 28:08.383
And you're still confident she's
been there two or three weeks?

28:08.384 --> 28:12.703
There's no more than three weeks'
hair regrowth from the roots,

28:12.704 --> 28:14.304
even with skin slippage.

28:15.744 --> 28:17.983
Was she killed where we found her?

28:17.984 --> 28:21.783
There was very little blood
at the scene, but it rained

28:21.784 --> 28:23.663
and the ground was porous.

28:23.664 --> 28:25.743
We've lost any postmortem hypostasis

28:25.744 --> 28:27.583
because of the skin discolouration

28:27.584 --> 28:29.784
so I couldn't really tell you.

28:31.984 --> 28:34.503
Are we looking at the same killer?
Yeah.

28:34.504 --> 28:38.944
Not as frenzied, not as extensive
internally, but, yeah.

29:14.384 --> 29:16.064
Where is everyone?

29:17.184 --> 29:19.103
Ryan's in bed.

29:19.104 --> 29:22.063
Clare and Neil are in t'kitchen
with Winnie and Ilinka,

29:22.064 --> 29:24.544
and why can't all these
people just go home?

29:30.864 --> 29:32.904
Are you all right?

29:36.024 --> 29:38.263
I've had a letter from a solicitor.

29:38.264 --> 29:40.224
About divorce proceedings.

29:47.704 --> 29:49.583
Hey...

29:49.584 --> 29:53.583
They think they've found
another one. It's been on t'news.

29:53.584 --> 29:54.943
National news on t'telly.

29:54.944 --> 29:56.543
Have they announced it officially?

29:56.544 --> 29:58.903
They're saying everything
suggests it's another one.

29:58.904 --> 30:00.303
I don't know how official it is.

30:00.304 --> 30:02.463
She's worried
it'll be someone else she knows.

30:02.464 --> 30:04.343
She says they went missing
all the time.

30:04.344 --> 30:07.463
And it's not just that.
They've let that fella out on bail.

30:07.464 --> 30:10.103
Can I pour you some tea?

30:10.104 --> 30:11.543
Catherine?

30:11.544 --> 30:12.823
No, thanks. What fella?

30:12.824 --> 30:16.783
The one you tasered.
He's called Goran Dragovic

30:16.784 --> 30:19.144
and she's terrified he's going
to come after her.

30:20.264 --> 30:21.903
He's been let out on bail?

30:21.904 --> 30:24.263
They charged him with
false imprisonment

30:24.264 --> 30:25.703
and people trafficking and...

30:25.704 --> 30:28.223
People trafficking for the purposes
of prostitution.

30:28.224 --> 30:30.424
And now they've let him
out on bail.

30:32.424 --> 30:34.264
Wow. Are they mental?

30:35.704 --> 30:38.544
It doesn't mean you're
in any more danger. Tell her.

30:42.904 --> 30:45.944
He might be out, but he still
doesn't know where you are.

30:47.584 --> 30:49.303
It just means he knows somebody

30:49.304 --> 30:51.623
with enough money
to pay his bail for him.

30:51.624 --> 30:53.743
The Knezevics?

30:53.744 --> 30:55.663
God knows.

30:55.664 --> 30:57.703
On the plus side,
he won't be going anywhere

30:57.704 --> 30:59.704
cos we'll have
taken his passport off him.

31:00.704 --> 31:05.023
If that is a plus.
There is something else as well.

31:05.024 --> 31:06.223
What? What?

31:06.224 --> 31:08.663
She wants to go back to work
at the biscuit factory.

31:08.664 --> 31:09.983
She can't do that.

31:09.984 --> 31:12.983
Well, I don't think
it's a great idea,

31:12.984 --> 31:16.383
but she keeps going on about how
they were all very nice to her,

31:16.384 --> 31:18.423
the other people,
and them that ran it.

31:18.424 --> 31:21.703
I mean,
they are a legitimate business.

31:21.704 --> 31:24.743
It doesn't matter.
What, employing trafficked women?

31:24.744 --> 31:29.183
No, that's... The people who own it
probably don't even realise

31:29.184 --> 31:32.543
they are trafficked, they probably
were perfectly nice to her.

31:32.544 --> 31:35.383
The problem is... How can they
not know? They don't pay 'em!

31:35.384 --> 31:37.423
No, they do!
The biscuit factory does.

31:37.424 --> 31:39.783
What happens is
the traffickers set themselves up

31:39.784 --> 31:41.383
as a legitimate employment agency.

31:41.384 --> 31:44.463
They don't go round advertising
the fact that they're criminal scum,

31:44.464 --> 31:46.303
it's not written
across their foreheads.

31:46.304 --> 31:49.583
They provide staff,
women, employees,

31:49.584 --> 31:52.183
then the biscuit factory
pays the money to them,

31:52.184 --> 31:54.943
the employment agency/criminal scum,

31:54.944 --> 31:57.303
then it's THEM that don't pass
the wages on to the women.

31:57.304 --> 31:59.263
That's how they make their money.
However...

31:59.264 --> 32:01.703
Devious bastards.
She still can't go back there.

32:01.704 --> 32:04.063
She still can't go back there,
cos it's not impossible

32:04.064 --> 32:07.023
that the Knezevics'll still have
people who go in there every day.

32:07.024 --> 32:09.463
Then they WILL see her
and they might follow her.

32:09.464 --> 32:11.703
She really can't do that,
Winnie, seriously.

32:11.704 --> 32:13.464
You've got to spell that out to her.

32:20.344 --> 32:22.864
You can't keep sleeping in here.

32:24.904 --> 32:26.663
Have you kept yourself busy today?

32:26.664 --> 32:28.104
Yeah, I've been fine.

32:31.544 --> 32:33.224
You all right?

32:35.904 --> 32:37.224
I just...

32:40.504 --> 32:43.504
I can't get my head round what
that woman's been through. Ilinka.

32:45.024 --> 32:48.343
I mean,
where do they get the idea from

32:48.344 --> 32:51.144
that they can do that to people?

32:56.144 --> 32:57.944
Is Neil stopping?

33:03.704 --> 33:07.424
You are good, you know.
The things you do for people.

33:09.864 --> 33:12.343
I've just wasted my life
doing bugger all,

33:12.344 --> 33:14.424
but you, you really help people.

33:16.664 --> 33:19.503
YOU help people. At the Mission.

33:19.504 --> 33:21.063
We make tea.

33:21.064 --> 33:23.104
No, you listen to people.

33:25.024 --> 33:26.664
It's important.

33:28.384 --> 33:29.984
Sorry.

33:31.424 --> 33:34.624
You're bereaved.
You're allowed to be upset.

33:38.144 --> 33:40.384
You just need to make sure
you look after yourself.

33:42.504 --> 33:43.823
Hm?

33:43.824 --> 33:45.383
Yeah.

33:45.384 --> 33:47.104
I am doing. I will.

33:53.744 --> 33:55.984
Neil thinks you don't like him.

33:57.344 --> 33:58.983
Why?

33:58.984 --> 34:00.903
When he offered to
make you some tea,

34:00.904 --> 34:02.783
you said you didn't want any.

34:02.784 --> 34:04.903
That's, like, an hour ago.

34:04.904 --> 34:09.143
Yeah, I know, I said that,
but, you know, I think...

34:09.143 --> 34:10.944
he's frightened of you.

34:12.063 --> 34:13.463
There's only one kind of person

34:13.464 --> 34:15.822
who needs to be frightened of me,
Clare. You know that.

34:15.824 --> 34:17.183
I know you like to think that,

34:17.184 --> 34:20.822
but, you know,
some people are just sensitive.

34:20.824 --> 34:22.304
Yeah, as in oversensitive.

34:24.864 --> 34:26.663
Been up to kiss Ryan?

34:26.664 --> 34:29.263
Yeah. He was asleep.

34:29.264 --> 34:31.103
He said summat today. Odd.

34:31.103 --> 34:32.543
What?

34:32.543 --> 34:35.543
Miss Wealand,
this new one that reads with him.

34:35.543 --> 34:38.023
I've met her,
she seems right enough.

34:38.024 --> 34:40.463
He said they were talking
about things he likes

34:40.464 --> 34:41.862
and things he doesn't like.

34:41.864 --> 34:46.983
He doesn't like reading, for
instance, and he does like chips.

34:46.984 --> 34:51.143
And custard and football,
that kind of thing.

34:51.143 --> 34:55.703
Anyway, apparently, she said,
"What about your dad?

34:55.704 --> 34:57.303
"Do you like your dad?"

34:57.304 --> 35:00.703
And he says... He just said,
"We don't talk about me dad,"

35:00.704 --> 35:03.903
and that were it. But why's
she asking him about his dad?

35:03.904 --> 35:06.463
Doesn't she know not to do that?
Haven't they told her?

35:06.464 --> 35:08.503
Ask her next time you see her.

35:08.504 --> 35:10.503
She won't be back there now
till next Monday,

35:10.504 --> 35:12.904
she only works
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.

35:44.464 --> 35:46.223
Can you two brush your teeth?

35:46.224 --> 35:47.944
Now. Right now.

35:52.304 --> 35:55.143
And I know for a fact
you weren't out on obs that night,

35:55.144 --> 35:56.343
cos I rang Clifford.

35:56.344 --> 35:58.783
Pack your shit and move out,
that's all I've got to say.

35:58.784 --> 36:00.103
I'll just keep repeating it.

36:00.104 --> 36:02.463
For years, I've put up with you
coming in at all hours.

36:02.464 --> 36:05.023
I can't believe you're still here,
to be honest with you.

36:05.024 --> 36:07.383
You need to be the one
that moves out, John, not me.

36:07.384 --> 36:10.023
You neglected us. There's no wonder
things've happened.

36:10.024 --> 36:13.063
These kids don't know who you are.
Whore. Slapper.

36:13.064 --> 36:14.703
They prefer Graham to you. Slag.

36:14.704 --> 36:17.063
He helps 'em with their homework.
Trollop.

36:17.064 --> 36:19.063
He talks to them. Filthy bitch.

36:19.064 --> 36:20.623
Pox merchant.

36:20.624 --> 36:22.303
You weren't on obs. You're a liar.

36:22.304 --> 36:24.143
Oh, really?
And what would Clifford know?

36:24.144 --> 36:26.263
He never gets sent on obs
because of his sciatica.

36:26.264 --> 36:27.823
Yeah, maybe I'll ask Andy Shepherd.

36:27.824 --> 36:30.063
Yeah, you've got a hotline
to the superintendent.

36:30.064 --> 36:34.063
Yeah, well, maybe I have.
Yeah? Really? D'you want his number?

36:34.064 --> 36:36.503
Mr Tekeli, I read your statement
for that assault.

36:36.504 --> 36:37.863
I see we're still struggling

36:37.864 --> 36:39.903
with the I before E
except after C concept

36:39.904 --> 36:42.143
and can you find someone
with more time and patience

36:42.144 --> 36:44.703
than I have to explain to you
the difference when you spell

36:44.704 --> 36:48.823
"he threatened to break my arm"
and "I applied the foot brake"?

36:48.824 --> 36:50.544
Thank you.

36:52.224 --> 36:53.824
I got you this.

36:55.504 --> 36:59.783
To say sorry. I was, you know,
tired and emotional

36:59.784 --> 37:02.983
and out of order and I'm sorry.

37:02.984 --> 37:05.303
I thought it'd remind you of me,
cos it's prickly.

37:05.304 --> 37:07.783
And I'm prickly. In fact,
you could call it Catherine

37:07.784 --> 37:10.303
and then next time you get cross
with me, you could...

37:10.304 --> 37:14.303
Throw it at you.
Yeah. Er, yeah, that'd work.

37:14.304 --> 37:16.583
Or I could call it
by your nickname.

37:16.584 --> 37:18.303
That might make me happy.

37:18.304 --> 37:20.903
Sure! Absolutely.
Except I haven't got one.

37:20.904 --> 37:22.143
Oh, you do!

37:22.144 --> 37:23.584
No...

37:25.424 --> 37:27.983
Do I? Obviously not one
we use to your face.

37:27.984 --> 37:30.423
What is it?
Well, it's a secret from you.

37:30.424 --> 37:32.343
Obviously, everybody else knows it.

37:32.344 --> 37:35.263
Everybody upstairs
and up at headquarters

37:35.264 --> 37:37.583
and that lot down at t'cafe
that does us butties.

37:37.584 --> 37:39.623
Well, what is it, then? It's...

37:39.624 --> 37:41.903
It's... It's not very flattering.

37:41.904 --> 37:43.143
I haven't got a nickname.

37:43.144 --> 37:45.183
No. Good. OK.

37:45.184 --> 37:46.543
What is it, then?

37:46.544 --> 37:48.023
I accept your apology.

37:48.024 --> 37:50.303
What's my nickname?
You haven't got one.

37:50.304 --> 37:52.663
How long have I had it?
I shouldn't have said anything.

37:52.664 --> 37:55.103
What are you going to call
the cactus, then? Nothing.

37:55.104 --> 37:56.863
No, come on, tell me
or I'm taking it back.

37:56.864 --> 37:59.383
OK. No, tell me.

37:59.384 --> 38:01.103
Look, I didn't invent it.

38:01.104 --> 38:02.503
What is it?

38:02.504 --> 38:04.143
Come here.

38:04.144 --> 38:07.703
I'm not telling you.
Right, whatever.

38:07.704 --> 38:09.424
Keep the cactus. Mm.

38:11.784 --> 38:14.383
These are those dates when I was out
murdering prostitutes,

38:14.384 --> 38:16.303
if you still want
to check your diary.

38:16.304 --> 38:18.703
Nothing I'd rather do.
Come on, what is it?

38:18.704 --> 38:20.623
You used to be a detective.
Find out.

38:20.624 --> 38:22.383
I will. Good! Good luck.

38:22.384 --> 38:23.984
Right! Mm.

38:25.984 --> 38:27.143
Are you lying?

38:27.144 --> 38:29.663
'Bravo November 45.

38:29.664 --> 38:32.903
'Could you look at log 134 of today,
at Crow Wood Park?

38:32.904 --> 38:35.744
'We've had a phone call from a nun
about a suspected suicide.'

38:36.864 --> 38:40.743
A nun? 'Paramedics are on their way.
Can you get someone round there?'

38:40.744 --> 38:43.423
A real nun? No, a pretend one(!)

38:43.424 --> 38:44.583
Responding.

38:44.584 --> 38:47.103
They might be dressed up
going to a hen party.

38:47.104 --> 38:49.783
Ten o'clock in t'morning?
Charlie Oscar 965.

38:49.784 --> 38:51.864
They might still be out
from the night before.

38:53.504 --> 38:55.303
Charlie Oscar 965.

38:55.304 --> 38:57.143
It's baptism of fire time, kid.

38:57.144 --> 38:58.943
We've got a suicide
up Crow Wood Park.

38:58.944 --> 39:02.023
'I'm coming to pick you up,
you're coming wi' me.'

39:02.024 --> 39:04.463
"We don't talk about me dad?"

39:04.464 --> 39:07.223
Yeah. But, listen, don't get cross!

39:07.224 --> 39:10.303
He said that, but then nothing
could be further from the truth.

39:10.304 --> 39:14.064
Once he started, it was like
he could talk about nothing else.

39:15.464 --> 39:16.703
What did he say?

39:16.704 --> 39:18.623
He said how much he liked you

39:18.624 --> 39:21.943
when he met you outside the shop
and on the boat

39:21.944 --> 39:24.223
and how he still thinks about you.

39:24.224 --> 39:26.583
Did he say that?
Did he actually say that?

39:26.584 --> 39:28.823
That he still thinks about me?
Every day.

39:28.824 --> 39:30.544
Yes. He said it.

39:32.144 --> 39:34.263
Yeah, but in a bad way.

39:34.264 --> 39:37.303
No!
He talked about bringing you milk.

39:37.304 --> 39:40.063
And how he upset you
by bringing his friend

39:40.064 --> 39:42.943
and how much he wishes
he hadn't done that now

39:42.944 --> 39:45.744
because that seemed
to spoil everything.

39:47.704 --> 39:49.264
Did he...?

39:51.384 --> 39:54.783
Did he say owt about me
chucking petrol all over him?

39:54.784 --> 39:56.583
He did. Yeah.

39:56.584 --> 39:58.223
That was really interesting,

39:58.224 --> 40:00.983
because he says
that all he can think of now

40:00.984 --> 40:03.783
is how ill you were when that
happened. I was.

40:03.784 --> 40:07.263
I WAS. I had septicaemia.
I were off me head, I nearly died!

40:07.264 --> 40:08.983
He thinks it's his fault. Eh?

40:08.984 --> 40:11.423
He said if he hadn't
brought his friend,

40:11.424 --> 40:13.984
you wouldn't have got upset
that day and done that.

40:15.104 --> 40:18.784
It wasn't his friend, as such.
He were a nice enough little lad.

40:20.064 --> 40:23.583
I were just frightened they were
going to tell people where I was,

40:23.584 --> 40:25.743
cos I knew they'd crucify me.

40:25.744 --> 40:28.143
I would never have hurt him,
Frances.

40:28.144 --> 40:29.864
Never.

40:31.784 --> 40:34.063
Not in a million years.

40:34.064 --> 40:36.224
I were just off me head.

40:38.024 --> 40:40.943
You see, I think he knows that.
Did he say it?

40:40.944 --> 40:43.463
No, no, but I could see in his eyes

40:43.464 --> 40:46.143
that he still really
thinks about you.

40:46.144 --> 40:48.144
In a good way.

40:49.984 --> 40:51.024
Hm!

40:52.984 --> 40:55.584
"We don't talk about me dad"!

40:58.264 --> 41:01.383
You see, she'll be trying to fill
his head with shit about me.

41:01.384 --> 41:03.903
You've got to tell him stuff,
Frances.

41:03.904 --> 41:06.303
You have got to make sure
he knows stuff.

41:06.304 --> 41:09.023
If you don't, nobody else will.
I can't. I will.

41:09.024 --> 41:10.903
Obviously, I will eventually...

41:10.904 --> 41:14.183
And all the other stuff,
all the lies I got convicted over.

41:14.184 --> 41:17.063
I did not rape Ann Gallagher.
That were Lewis.

41:17.064 --> 41:19.863
It were me that used to bring her
Mars bars and let her use t'bucket.

41:19.864 --> 41:23.023
I did not kill that little
police girl up on t'moor either.

41:23.024 --> 41:24.183
That were Lewis.

41:24.184 --> 41:28.383
And I had to kill him, cos he come at me with
that knife! I know. But nobody believes me.

41:28.384 --> 41:29.704
I do.

41:31.184 --> 41:32.304
Yeah.

41:33.824 --> 41:35.784
Except you.

41:44.224 --> 41:47.063
I did kick the shite
out of his granny,

41:47.064 --> 41:49.903
but A, she were asking for it,

41:49.904 --> 41:52.463
and B, she would have killed me.

41:52.464 --> 41:54.543
Spraying me wi' that stuff!

41:54.544 --> 41:57.503
She would have killed me
on that boat an' all

41:57.504 --> 41:59.543
if that woman hadn't come
and pulled her off me,

41:59.544 --> 42:02.183
and has she ever
been taken to court over that?

42:02.184 --> 42:03.943
Has she hell as like!

42:03.944 --> 42:07.143
And now there's been another murder
on t'news. Have you seen it?

42:07.144 --> 42:09.064
Yeah. Just the same as me mother.

42:10.424 --> 42:12.744
She is a clever bitch...

42:14.184 --> 42:16.584
...making it look like
a serial killer.

42:18.384 --> 42:19.983
You see, I know.

42:19.984 --> 42:23.223
I've told you before,
I know how a bitch like that thinks.

42:23.224 --> 42:25.264
She is poison, her.

42:27.784 --> 42:29.744
She's dangerous.

42:33.824 --> 42:37.664
I know we try not to have
nasty thoughts, Frances, but...

42:41.784 --> 42:44.824
...she needs putting out of
her misery, that one.

42:52.504 --> 42:55.983
He's been talking about things
at home.

42:55.984 --> 42:58.063
His Auntie Clare drinks.

42:58.064 --> 43:00.263
I've met her. She's a nice woman.

43:00.264 --> 43:03.863
But between the grandmother's anger
and his auntie's problem,

43:03.864 --> 43:06.063
yes, we could ask for better things.

43:06.064 --> 43:08.023
We have to get him out of there.

43:08.024 --> 43:10.663
Well, we can't get him
out of there just yet.

43:10.664 --> 43:13.984
But we can keep an eye on him.
Can't we? No...

43:15.304 --> 43:18.063
Frances, I keep telling you...

43:18.064 --> 43:20.504
and you keep not hearing me!

43:25.704 --> 43:28.024
That is not enough.

43:34.024 --> 43:39.343
If a detective - he's a sergeant -
asks me out for a drink,

43:39.344 --> 43:41.584
that's not unethical, is it?

43:43.904 --> 43:45.983
Is he married?

43:45.984 --> 43:48.863
Well, yeah, he is,
but he's just found out

43:48.864 --> 43:51.903
his wife's been having it off
with someone else, so...

43:51.904 --> 43:53.863
Is he old enough to be your dad?

43:53.864 --> 43:55.103
No.

43:55.104 --> 43:57.023
Yeah, actually. He probably is.

43:57.024 --> 44:01.023
He's not as old as my dad,
but, yeah, technically.

44:01.024 --> 44:03.663
And do you believe him
about his wife?

44:03.664 --> 44:06.943
I don't fancy him. We're just mates.

44:06.944 --> 44:09.143
Yeah, but is that what he thinks?

44:09.144 --> 44:11.863
It's not really ethics, is it, love?

44:11.864 --> 44:14.544
It's about whether it's wise or not.

44:23.384 --> 44:24.863
You know at work...

44:24.864 --> 44:26.623
Yeah?

44:26.624 --> 44:29.063
Have I got a nickname?

44:29.064 --> 44:30.784
One or two.

44:36.424 --> 44:38.063
One or two?

44:38.064 --> 44:39.744
I don't use them.

44:42.064 --> 44:44.663
Oh... That bad, eh?

44:44.664 --> 44:47.583
Do you think maybe
I COULD go for a drink with him?

44:47.584 --> 44:49.903
See, I'm interested
in the possibility

44:49.904 --> 44:52.183
of becoming a detective,
eventually, so..

44:52.184 --> 44:54.543
So what are they, then,
these nicknames?

44:54.544 --> 44:57.343
Why are you putting me on the spot?
Cos you're here.

44:57.344 --> 44:58.743
I've never met a nun.

44:58.744 --> 45:00.983
The way you changed
the subject then

45:00.984 --> 45:02.903
was so subtle, I barely noticed(!)

45:02.904 --> 45:05.743
Me dad says it's a compliment
when people have a nickname.

45:05.744 --> 45:07.943
He says people don't bother
giving a nickname

45:07.944 --> 45:09.743
to someone
they're not bothered about.

45:09.744 --> 45:12.783
So, well, what are they, then?
I wouldn't worry about it.

45:12.784 --> 45:14.663
I'm not worried.

45:14.664 --> 45:16.103
I'm delighted.

45:16.104 --> 45:19.743
I didn't know I had a nickname.
Two nicknames.

45:19.744 --> 45:22.823
Hello. Are you all right, love?

45:22.824 --> 45:25.703
Just a bit of shock.
She's going to be absolutely fine.

45:25.704 --> 45:27.504
Right. So where is it?

45:29.304 --> 45:31.183
Who found him? You?

45:31.184 --> 45:32.983
Yes, it was us that phoned.

45:32.984 --> 45:37.183
Vodka bottles everywhere.
He must've got tanked up to do it.

45:37.184 --> 45:38.543
OK.

45:38.544 --> 45:41.463
Can you get a first account
out of those two for me?

45:41.464 --> 45:44.223
Who they are, what they're doing
here, where they're from.

45:44.224 --> 45:47.103
They're nuns, I shouldn't think
they're up to much. He's dead.

45:47.104 --> 45:48.863
Thanks, love. It's on the left.

45:48.864 --> 45:51.383
Careful as you go down.
It's a bit slippery.

45:51.384 --> 45:53.543
They'll be from St Werburgh's.

45:53.544 --> 45:56.583
Find out if they walk through here
regularly and, if they do,

45:56.584 --> 45:58.103
at what times,

45:58.104 --> 46:01.343
and if they're familiar with anybody
else who walks through here.

46:01.344 --> 46:03.783
Bravo November 45,
I'm in Crow Wood Park,

46:03.784 --> 46:06.623
suspected suicide confirmed dead
by the paramedic.

46:06.624 --> 46:08.063
We need a CSI here

46:08.064 --> 46:11.024
and somebody from CID,
if there's anyone available.

46:19.144 --> 46:21.183
Wow...

46:21.184 --> 46:22.543
Yeah.

46:22.544 --> 46:25.423
How are you going to get him down?
That's easy.

46:25.424 --> 46:28.463
I'm going to wait for CID to turn up
and let them do it.

46:28.464 --> 46:31.343
So, come on. These names.

46:31.344 --> 46:33.823
Just spit 'em out quickly,
then it's done with.

46:33.824 --> 46:36.503
I don't want to be, like,
the messenger that gets shot.

46:36.504 --> 46:38.863
What, do you think
I'm that small-minded?

46:38.864 --> 46:40.903
Shall I go
and take those first accounts?

46:40.904 --> 46:44.343
I'll tell you what... You can
write 'em down, if it's easier.

46:44.344 --> 46:47.343
I'm not sure I should.
No, love, I'm not asking you.

46:47.344 --> 46:49.663
I think, going back to ethics,

46:49.664 --> 46:52.703
you shouldn't use your rank to make
me tell you something like that.

46:52.704 --> 46:54.343
Rank? We're friends.

46:54.344 --> 46:56.183
Not at work! You said that.

46:56.184 --> 46:58.783
I saved your life from that bastard.

46:58.784 --> 47:02.223
Yeah, go on, lady.
Get round that one.

47:02.224 --> 47:04.904
Do you really want to know
that badly?

47:06.384 --> 47:07.904
Catherine?

47:09.984 --> 47:11.543
Are they really shit?

47:11.544 --> 47:13.104
No.

47:14.784 --> 47:17.223
They're affectionate but, you know,

47:17.224 --> 47:21.184
not... not... not something you might
choose for yourself. That's all.

47:22.704 --> 47:25.344
If you really want to know,
I WILL tell you.

47:27.824 --> 47:29.344
What's up?

47:30.424 --> 47:31.863
I know him.

47:31.864 --> 47:34.223
It's that bloke I tasered.

47:34.224 --> 47:37.104
They let him out on bail yesterday.

47:41.304 --> 47:43.304
Do you want to do the talking?

47:45.264 --> 47:46.863
Good practice for you.

47:46.864 --> 47:49.423
And anyway, look,
it was me that tasered him.

47:49.424 --> 47:51.863
If we weren't so understaffed
and under-resourced,

47:51.864 --> 47:53.663
I wouldn't even be here.

47:53.664 --> 47:55.864
This is bordering on awkward.

48:05.424 --> 48:07.503
Mrs Dragovic? There's no-one here.

48:07.504 --> 48:09.223
Is your husband Goran Dragovic?

48:09.224 --> 48:11.983
He's not here, he works shifts.
Could we come in?

48:11.984 --> 48:15.703
It's not a good time for me,
I'm busy, I'm going out.

48:15.704 --> 48:19.263
It's important, Mrs Dragovic.
There's been an accident.

48:19.264 --> 48:22.424
What accident? Can we...?

48:29.064 --> 48:31.384
You might want to sit down.

48:38.704 --> 48:41.303
Hiya. Oh, hello.

48:41.304 --> 48:44.383
I saw a dead body this morning.
This fella hanged himself.

48:44.384 --> 48:46.063
You'll get used to it.

48:46.064 --> 48:48.463
I didn't mind. I was fascinated.

48:48.464 --> 48:50.063
His tongue was like...

48:50.064 --> 48:52.143
and his lips were blue, proper blue,

48:52.144 --> 48:55.223
and his eyes were all,
like, bulging out.

48:55.224 --> 48:58.023
Does that make me weird?
Not being freaked?

48:58.024 --> 49:01.423
Is it true that men get an erection
when they hang?

49:01.424 --> 49:04.783
Well, it depends what
they were doing at the time.

49:04.784 --> 49:07.303
So normally not, then?

49:07.304 --> 49:09.183
Nah. It's a myth.

49:09.184 --> 49:12.623
OK. Good! Well, there you go.
I've learned something!

49:12.624 --> 49:15.583
Inspector Taylor sent me up
with this for Mr Shepherd.

49:15.584 --> 49:17.823
Is he in? No, he's stepped out.

49:17.824 --> 49:20.503
It's nothing. It's just
Brunhilde's alibi. Finally.

49:20.504 --> 49:23.183
Joyce at t'front desk
worked it out. Brunhilde?

49:23.184 --> 49:25.503
Miss Trunchbull. Sergeant Cawood.

49:25.504 --> 49:27.824
I'll put it on his desk.

49:29.504 --> 49:31.464
You still want to go for a drink?

49:33.504 --> 49:35.943
Well, yeah. Yeah, if you...
I would!

49:35.944 --> 49:37.223
Tonight? Moorings?

49:37.224 --> 49:39.544
Seven? Half past? Great. Seven.

49:43.664 --> 49:45.943
Where's all the boards?

49:45.944 --> 49:47.543
What boards?

49:47.544 --> 49:49.623
You know, on telly,
they have all glass boards

49:49.624 --> 49:52.943
with photos of the deceased
and clues and, you know, stuff.

49:52.944 --> 49:55.663
Yeah, well,
in real life, we have these.

49:55.664 --> 49:57.623
Can I look? Er...

49:57.624 --> 50:01.183
No. It's... There's some
pretty graphic stuff in there.

50:01.184 --> 50:03.064
I want to be a detective.

50:04.384 --> 50:06.423
I want to do what you lot do.

50:06.424 --> 50:08.183
Ma'am?

50:08.184 --> 50:09.704
Sure!

50:19.304 --> 50:21.623
Is this the most recent victim?

50:21.624 --> 50:22.904
Yeah.

50:25.064 --> 50:28.183
How was the postmortem?
Did you learn anything?

50:28.184 --> 50:29.783
Oh, just...

50:29.784 --> 50:31.343
Not much.

50:31.344 --> 50:33.183
Well, nothing relevant.

50:33.184 --> 50:35.383
Well, we think
she's not a prostitute, John.

50:35.384 --> 50:37.023
That's pretty relevant. Not?

50:37.024 --> 50:39.463
Oh, yeah, yeah. The clothes.

50:39.464 --> 50:43.183
Expensive dress and shoes,
other lifestyle...

50:43.184 --> 50:46.383
You know, she didn't smoke,
didn't drink, she...

50:46.384 --> 50:48.943
Her teeth were well looked after.
So, yeah, yeah.

50:48.944 --> 50:51.583
So... how will you identify her?

50:51.584 --> 50:55.703
Well, sometimes we get
a DNA match on our database,

50:55.704 --> 50:59.823
but that's usually only if they've
committed a crime in the past.

50:59.824 --> 51:03.383
And she hasn't, so we've been
looking at missing persons, but...

51:03.384 --> 51:05.263
You know we never found the woman

51:05.264 --> 51:08.743
who lived in the burnt-out flat
in Ripponden, don't you?

51:08.744 --> 51:10.543
Two weeks ago.

51:10.544 --> 51:12.503
Yeah, no, as I say, you know,

51:12.504 --> 51:14.983
we've, er... we've checked
all the local mispers,

51:14.984 --> 51:17.343
but she's probably been cleared
for whatever reason.

51:17.344 --> 51:19.263
No, this woman isn't a misper.

51:19.264 --> 51:21.663
No-one ever actually
reported her missing, as such.

51:21.664 --> 51:24.063
She's called Victoria Fleming,
Vicky Fleming,

51:24.064 --> 51:26.303
and how old is your woman?

51:26.304 --> 51:28.143
Between 45 and 55.

51:28.144 --> 51:31.184
That's... That would fit the bill.
Really?

51:32.904 --> 51:35.263
This is her? Yeah.

51:35.264 --> 51:38.303
Blonde shoulder-length hair,
slim build.

51:38.304 --> 51:40.543
I've got a photo of her on file.

51:40.544 --> 51:42.063
Me and Shaf went down to talk to HR

51:42.064 --> 51:44.263
at the department store
where she works.

51:44.264 --> 51:46.583
We made a copy.
Shall I e-mail it to you?

51:46.584 --> 51:50.984
Well, that's... that's... That'd be
really helpful, if you could. Right.

51:53.624 --> 51:56.704
Hm. Joined-up thinking.

51:58.384 --> 52:00.264
Why didn't we know about this?

52:02.944 --> 52:04.903
'You're kidding.' Nope.

52:04.904 --> 52:08.343
Well done. Fantastic!
Thank you, Joyce. Thank you.

52:08.344 --> 52:10.464
Yeah, well,
that's what friends are...

52:15.704 --> 52:17.943
The night Aurelia Petrovic
was murdered,

52:17.944 --> 52:21.303
this is five months ago,
I was at Oldham Coliseum with Joyce

52:21.304 --> 52:23.623
dressed up like a pillock
for the Rocky Horror Show!

52:23.624 --> 52:26.583
She invited me at the last second
cos her cousin dropped out.

52:26.584 --> 52:28.503
That's why it never went
on me calendar.

52:28.504 --> 52:30.583
So when Aurelia Petrovic
was getting slashed,

52:30.584 --> 52:33.503
you and Joyce were doing
the Time Warp. Isn't life weird?

52:33.504 --> 52:37.143
I can't picture that.
Yeah, don't try.

52:37.144 --> 52:40.263
Off the hook. It's official.

52:40.264 --> 52:42.343
Not the guilty party after all.

52:42.344 --> 52:45.183
So Jodie Shackleton can stick that
up her pipe and smoke it.

52:45.184 --> 52:47.223
IN her pipe and smoke it.

52:47.224 --> 52:50.223
I don't care where she sticks it.
I've rung her anyway.

52:50.224 --> 52:52.143
I've told her. (Bitch.)

52:52.144 --> 52:54.303
Neil's coming for his tea. OK.

52:54.304 --> 52:56.423
You won't frighten him, will you?

52:56.424 --> 52:58.023
I will do me best.

52:58.024 --> 53:00.784
And can you ask Daniel not to be...
weird with him?

53:03.024 --> 53:04.464
Sure.

53:06.304 --> 53:08.583
How was school? Boring.

53:08.584 --> 53:12.983
Oi, what's this about Miss Wealand
asking you about your dad?

53:12.984 --> 53:16.543
Nothing. I told her, I said,
"We don't talk about me dad."

53:16.544 --> 53:20.263
What have I told you about kicking
your ball against Winnie's wall?

53:20.264 --> 53:21.944
Well, keep it that way.

53:27.424 --> 53:30.144
It's only me. All right?

53:32.144 --> 53:33.783
I've got good news.

53:33.784 --> 53:35.703
Well, it's macabre news.

53:35.704 --> 53:37.864
Goran Dragovic is dead.

53:39.984 --> 53:43.104
Suicide. He hanged himself
from a tree in Crow Wood Park.

53:55.264 --> 53:58.903
She... She says he would never
kill himself. It's them.

53:58.904 --> 54:02.144
They shut him up
so he won't... he won't talk.

54:24.144 --> 54:25.343
Hello.

54:25.344 --> 54:27.943
Bloody hell, John,
it's definitely Vicky Fleming.

54:27.944 --> 54:32.823
I've spoken to the OIC on District and I've
given the lab a bell to chassey them along

54:32.824 --> 54:35.823
for any DNA matches they might
have found from the personal stuff

54:35.824 --> 54:37.623
they got from her workplace, but...

54:37.624 --> 54:41.543
Oh, it's her. I mean, you can see
it's her from the photos.

54:41.544 --> 54:43.423
She's even, in one of these photos,

54:43.424 --> 54:46.184
wearing that same dress
she was wearing when she died.

54:47.944 --> 54:49.743
'John?'

54:49.744 --> 54:51.463
Great.

54:51.464 --> 54:52.823
Yeah.

54:52.824 --> 54:55.744
Have you told the boss? Yeah.

54:57.744 --> 55:00.543
Well done.
'Right. I'll see you, then.'

55:00.544 --> 55:02.064
Bye.

55:23.464 --> 55:25.343
Are you all right, love?

55:25.344 --> 55:27.503
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm sorry.

55:27.504 --> 55:31.343
You were right over the wrong side
of the road. I'm sorry.

55:31.344 --> 55:32.823
Are you OK?

55:32.824 --> 55:34.863
Yeah. Um...

55:34.864 --> 55:37.104
I'm just a bit shaken.

55:38.504 --> 55:40.903
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine, love.

55:40.904 --> 55:43.663
You just gave me
a bit of a surprise, that's all.

55:43.664 --> 55:46.384
You want to be more careful.
