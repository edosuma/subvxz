00:07.340 --> 00:08.341
- Good job, Will.
- Thank you.

00:08.341 --> 00:09.718
Good game, Will.

00:09.718 --> 00:10.844
Yup.
You look good out there.

00:10.844 --> 00:13.221
- >> Coach, good game, man.
- Thank you.

00:13.221 --> 00:14.347
>> Good game, coach.

00:14.347 --> 00:15.473
- See yah, coach.
- Thank you. Be good.

00:15.473 --> 00:16.599
Hey, can I drive?

00:16.599 --> 00:17.517
>> Have you lost
your mind?

00:17.517 --> 00:18.768
It's raining, son.

00:18.768 --> 00:19.894
>> Well, I have my permit.

00:19.894 --> 00:21.020
>> He does need
to practice,

00:21.020 --> 00:22.021
even on the rain.

00:22.021 --> 00:22.814
>> Yeah.

00:22.814 --> 00:23.690
>> All right.

00:23.690 --> 00:24.566
We'll split the
difference here.

00:24.566 --> 00:25.859
I'll let you back
the truck out,

00:25.859 --> 00:27.360
and then I'ma drive home.

00:27.360 --> 00:28.278
You good with that?
>> Mmm Hmm.

00:28.278 --> 00:30.155
>> All right, cool.
Back it out.

00:30.155 --> 00:31.281
Foot on the break!

00:31.281 --> 00:34.409
Hey, I didn't serve
over seas, okay,

00:34.409 --> 00:36.244
to die in a parking lot.

00:36.244 --> 00:37.454
>> Take your time.

00:37.454 --> 00:39.330
>> All right, hands at ten...

00:39.330 --> 00:40.540
>> Don't let dad
and Si make you

00:40.540 --> 00:41.791
nervous now, Will.

00:41.791 --> 00:42.584
>> Okay.

00:42.584 --> 00:43.710
>> Okay, take your time,

00:43.710 --> 00:45.295
but like a little faster
than what you're doing.

00:45.670 --> 00:47.464
>> So it's kind of
a tradition in our family

00:47.464 --> 00:49.924
that Willie teaches
the kids how to drive.

00:49.924 --> 00:51.426
>> I potty trained them.

00:51.426 --> 00:53.595
Also, helped then
with their homework,

00:53.595 --> 00:55.096
read books to them...

00:55.096 --> 00:57.140
All right Will,
you got this.

00:58.057 --> 00:59.934
All clear behind you.

01:01.936 --> 01:02.812
>> Stop.

01:02.812 --> 01:04.522
>> Oh, is that all
you're doing?

01:04.522 --> 01:05.523
>> Put it in park.

01:05.523 --> 01:07.066
>> Okay, well,
you did good.

01:07.066 --> 01:08.026
You didn't
kill anybody,

01:08.026 --> 01:09.778
or injure anybody.

01:09.778 --> 01:10.779
Good job!

01:10.779 --> 01:13.740
>> I never remembered
you reading me a book.

01:13.740 --> 01:14.532
>> Me?
You never remembered

01:14.532 --> 01:15.909
me reading
you a book?

01:15.909 --> 01:16.993
>> How soon they forget.

01:16.993 --> 01:17.786
>> I might not
cook for you,

01:17.786 --> 01:19.412
but I read you
a lot of books.

01:19.412 --> 01:21.080
Actually, I cooked for you
when you were a baby.

01:25.919 --> 01:26.711
Good job, Will.

01:26.711 --> 01:27.545
>> Thanks.

01:27.545 --> 01:28.588
>> He's been doing
really good.

01:28.588 --> 01:29.380
I think he might be-

01:29.380 --> 01:30.423
All right,
easy big man.

01:30.423 --> 01:31.633
>> I think he might
our best driver.

01:31.633 --> 01:32.842
>> Cut it to the other
direction.

01:32.842 --> 01:34.177
>> Si, I think I know
what I'm doing.

01:34.177 --> 01:35.553
>> Hey, you're fixin'
to run over something.

01:35.553 --> 01:36.429
>> I ain't running
over nothing.

01:37.847 --> 01:38.932
>> Shoot!

01:38.932 --> 01:39.933
>> I told you was gonna
run over something.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.434
>> Si, I just bumped it.

01:41.434 --> 01:42.936
Coach, you all right?

01:42.936 --> 01:44.854
They should've
let you drive.

01:44.854 --> 01:46.231
They should've
let you drive.

01:46.231 --> 01:49.400
You knocked over
the whole thing.

01:49.400 --> 01:50.527
You gotta watch it-

01:50.527 --> 01:52.862
Si, was back
there talking, distracting me.

01:52.862 --> 01:53.863
Willie!

01:53.863 --> 01:55.698
You cannot blame
this on Si.

01:55.698 --> 01:57.617
>> I can blame
anything on Si.

01:57.617 --> 01:58.910
You hit the cart.

01:58.910 --> 02:00.703
>> Ya'll should break
that tradition,

02:00.703 --> 02:02.497
of him teaching
them how to drive.

02:02.497 --> 02:04.332
>> I'll teach him.

02:04.332 --> 02:06.417
>> When's the last time
you into something?

02:07.252 --> 02:08.670
>> On the way here.

02:08.670 --> 02:10.213
>> "On the way here,"
she says.

02:10.213 --> 02:11.548
>> I knocked off our
rear-view mirror.

02:11.548 --> 02:12.882
>> She knocked of
part of the mirror.

02:12.882 --> 02:13.716
>> Are you serious?

02:13.716 --> 02:14.634
>> Yes.
She hit the garage.

02:14.634 --> 02:15.426
>> It's true.

02:15.426 --> 02:16.678
>> So, this is
a family thing.

02:16.678 --> 02:17.846
Actually,
John Luke ran into

02:17.846 --> 02:19.180
your car, right?

02:19.180 --> 02:20.098
Right.

02:20.098 --> 02:21.558
>> Whenever he first
got his license.

02:21.558 --> 02:23.268
>> That's why I got
tape set back there.

02:24.853 --> 02:27.188
>> Hey, and guess
who taught him.

02:27.188 --> 02:28.523
Dang it.
That's a scratch.

02:28.523 --> 02:29.941
>> I'm having a hard
time with this family.

02:29.941 --> 02:32.068
>> Oh, that'll buff right out,
don't worry about it.

02:32.068 --> 02:33.361
>> It's weird that we're
going to have

02:33.361 --> 02:36.072
four kids that are
be driving.

02:36.072 --> 02:38.449
>> West Monroe will
never be the same.

02:38.449 --> 02:39.868
>> That's a lot
of insurance.

02:39.868 --> 02:41.035
>> Oh yeah.

02:41.035 --> 02:42.787
>> You got the money
to pay for it.

02:42.787 --> 02:44.622
Don't worry about it.
>> Pipe down, Si.

02:44.622 --> 02:45.999
>> All right, sorry about
that, coach.

02:45.999 --> 02:48.209
Si, see what you did?
>> What?! Me?!

02:48.209 --> 02:49.168
>> Well, I'm saying
you're there sitting in

02:49.168 --> 02:50.753
my ear the whole time.

02:50.753 --> 02:53.298
>> Do not blame your
bad driving on me.

02:53.298 --> 02:55.758
>> Dad, I don't think
you should teach me.

03:09.772 --> 03:10.481
Hey, Missy.

03:10.481 --> 03:11.524
How are you this evening?

03:11.524 --> 03:13.109
>> Mr. Kirby!
>> Is Jase here?

03:13.109 --> 03:14.110
>> Sure.
Come on in.

03:14.110 --> 03:14.861
>> Hey, Jase.

03:14.861 --> 03:15.778
>> Look, it wasn't me.

03:15.778 --> 03:16.696
>> Hey, Randy Kirby.

03:16.696 --> 03:18.990
Good seeing you again.
>> Hey.

03:18.990 --> 03:20.116
>> One of our
neighbors saw-

03:20.116 --> 03:21.534
noticed a beaver in our
neighborhood and they're

03:21.534 --> 03:23.369
concerned that it
might be rabid.

03:23.369 --> 03:25.580
Can beavers
have rabies?

03:25.580 --> 03:26.664
>> Probably not.

03:26.664 --> 03:28.833
He's probably just sayin'
this is my territory.

03:28.833 --> 03:29.667
>> Is this something
you think you can

03:29.667 --> 03:30.835
help us with?

03:30.835 --> 03:33.129
>> Oh, I can take care
of that problem.

03:33.129 --> 03:34.172
Quick.

03:34.172 --> 03:35.715
But I figured that
wasn't part of the rules.

03:36.424 --> 03:37.425
>> Okay.

03:37.425 --> 03:39.093
So, HOA does not want
us to burn leaves

03:39.093 --> 03:40.219
in the drive-way.

03:40.219 --> 03:41.346
>> Stupid.

03:41.346 --> 03:42.305
>> Jason!

03:42.305 --> 03:43.473
We're gonna get in
trouble, again.

03:43.473 --> 03:44.474
>> Huh!

03:44.474 --> 03:45.308
>> Have chickens.

03:45.308 --> 03:46.267
>> Dumb.

03:46.267 --> 03:47.435
>> Get 'em. Get 'em.

03:47.435 --> 03:48.519
Chickens make me happy!

03:48.519 --> 03:50.021
You cannot
have chickens.

03:50.021 --> 03:51.439
>> Dump grease in
our flower beds.

03:51.439 --> 03:52.398
>> Ignorant.

03:52.398 --> 03:53.483
>> Smells like bacon.

03:53.483 --> 03:55.068
>> You can't dump
grease in your front yard?

03:55.068 --> 03:55.944
>> No, sir.

03:55.944 --> 03:58.071
>> But now the
tables have turned.

03:58.071 --> 04:00.990
I usually charge
fifty bucks.

04:00.990 --> 04:03.201
Cause they're scared
of a little beaver.

04:07.372 --> 04:09.207
>> Maybe as a favor
to the neighborhood,

04:09.207 --> 04:10.333
you could uh,

04:10.333 --> 04:12.877
provide a little bit
of pest control for us.

04:12.877 --> 04:13.962
>> Well...

04:13.962 --> 04:17.340
What if I dump my
oil and grease in my yard,

04:17.340 --> 04:18.925
I take care of your
pest problem,

04:18.925 --> 04:20.009
and we call it even.

04:20.009 --> 04:22.095
>> If you'll take
care of the beaver problem,

04:22.095 --> 04:23.179
then you can dump
your grease in the

04:23.179 --> 04:25.348
backyard any time
you want.

04:25.348 --> 04:26.766
Oh my goodness.

04:26.766 --> 04:27.767
Now we're talking.

04:27.767 --> 04:29.269
>> Now, there's
one condition.

04:29.269 --> 04:31.104
We really need
to be discreet.

04:31.104 --> 04:33.523
>> Hey, I'm all about
discretion.

04:33.523 --> 04:35.024
>> You'll never
know we're there.

04:35.024 --> 04:36.150
No, no, no, no really-

04:36.150 --> 04:38.403
>> You want in on
the beaver hunt?

04:38.403 --> 04:39.946
I like when you
come hunting with me.

04:39.946 --> 04:41.572
>> I 'm not a big fan
of duck hunting.

04:41.572 --> 04:43.449
>> But that's why
you may be a beaver hunter,

04:43.449 --> 04:44.784
cause you get to
go at night.

04:44.784 --> 04:45.743
>> And I get to stay
up late.

04:45.743 --> 04:46.786
>> No, no, no, no.

04:46.786 --> 04:48.663
Nobody's hunting a
beaver under age twelve.

04:48.663 --> 04:53.167
>> You said under
age twelve, I am twelve.

04:53.167 --> 04:54.002
>> I did, didn't I?

04:54.002 --> 04:54.961
>> Thank you,
thank you.

04:54.961 --> 04:56.004
>> Boom.

04:56.004 --> 04:57.088
When I was a kid,

04:57.088 --> 05:00.550
this is how I bonded
with my dad.

05:00.550 --> 05:01.884
We went hunting.

05:01.884 --> 05:03.553
That was the first
positive thing

05:03.553 --> 05:04.637
that I saw in
him do.

05:04.637 --> 05:06.222
It's called family bonding.

05:06.222 --> 05:08.266
>> I might need to
come out there and watch.

05:08.266 --> 05:09.767
>> Mom, no.

05:10.101 --> 05:11.561
>> Listen,
this is awesome.

05:11.561 --> 05:12.854
It's going to work
out perfect.

05:12.854 --> 05:14.147
I really appreciate it.

05:14.147 --> 05:15.273
>> Bye, Mia.
Bye, Missy.

05:15.273 --> 05:16.065
>> Thank you, Randy.

05:16.065 --> 05:16.858
>> Good deal.

05:16.858 --> 05:17.942
Come by any time.

05:17.942 --> 05:19.819
They eventually need
something from you.

05:19.819 --> 05:22.447
And then the neighborhood
warms up to you.

05:22.447 --> 05:24.782
They got a rabid beaver.

05:24.782 --> 05:26.576
>> You should've asked
for the chickens.

05:27.535 --> 05:28.494
My goodness.

05:28.494 --> 05:30.038
I should've asked
for the chickens.

05:30.038 --> 05:30.997
Why didn't we?!

05:30.997 --> 05:34.542
I don't know.

05:42.175 --> 05:43.843
Hey dad,
since it stopped raining,

05:43.843 --> 05:45.178
can I drive home?

05:45.178 --> 05:46.763
Uh, maybe rain
coming, son.

05:46.763 --> 05:48.556
Dad!

05:48.556 --> 05:50.183
All right.

05:50.183 --> 05:51.559
Gotta practice some time.

05:51.559 --> 05:52.268
>> He's gotta practice.

05:52.268 --> 05:53.352
Sweet.

05:53.352 --> 05:55.521
Look, he's not
qualified to teach you.

05:55.521 --> 05:56.355
You were the
one who hit the

05:56.355 --> 05:57.440
basketballs, babe.

05:57.440 --> 05:58.399
>> That's right.

05:58.399 --> 06:00.401
>> I kissed them,
like a gentle kiss.

06:00.401 --> 06:01.861
>> No you didn't-
No, no.

06:01.861 --> 06:03.529
>> It's because you
were talking-

06:03.529 --> 06:04.906
>> No, no, don't blame
it on me.

06:04.906 --> 06:06.157
I ain't the one
on the wheel.

06:06.157 --> 06:08.743
Besides, okay, think of
this, this way.

06:08.743 --> 06:10.787
What if that had
been bombs?

06:10.787 --> 06:11.788
>> What?!

06:11.788 --> 06:12.914
>> Yeah, there could've
been bombs, dad.

06:12.914 --> 06:14.791
>> They could've
been bombs.

06:16.334 --> 06:17.251
Boom.

06:17.251 --> 06:18.836
We'd all be dead.

06:19.837 --> 06:21.214
>> You are not fit to
teach this young man

06:21.214 --> 06:23.424
how to drive, because
you're not fit.

06:23.424 --> 06:25.551
Unlike me,
I am fit.

06:25.551 --> 06:26.803
>> What does being
fit have to

06:26.803 --> 06:27.762
do with driving?

06:27.762 --> 06:28.846
>> There ain't but
one guy around here

06:28.846 --> 06:30.098
that's qualified
to teach you how

06:30.098 --> 06:31.224
to drive a vehicle.

06:31.224 --> 06:32.558
That be
yours truly.

06:32.558 --> 06:33.309
Oh no.

06:33.309 --> 06:34.352
>> Okay.

06:34.352 --> 06:36.729
>> The only thing he
teach you driving wise,

06:36.729 --> 06:39.357
is to drive through
at a restaurant.

06:39.357 --> 06:40.399
>> Not rue.

06:40.399 --> 06:41.150
>> May I take your order?

06:41.150 --> 06:43.319
Yup.
Four massive burgers.

06:43.319 --> 06:45.279
I've drove everything
from a jeep,

06:45.279 --> 06:46.864
to an M-1 Abrams tank.

06:46.864 --> 06:47.824
>> M-1 Abram tank.

06:47.824 --> 06:48.616
We get it, Si.

06:48.616 --> 06:49.408
>> Okay.

06:49.408 --> 06:50.368
Then I'm qualified.

06:50.368 --> 06:51.327
>> Actually.

06:51.327 --> 06:52.495
Dad, can we stop by
somewhere to get

06:52.495 --> 06:53.496
something to eat?

06:55.623 --> 06:56.833
>> I'll tell you guys what.

06:56.833 --> 06:58.668
I'll get my driver's manual-

06:58.668 --> 06:59.669
>> A manual?

06:59.669 --> 07:01.629
>> And I'm gonna see
who's best according

07:01.629 --> 07:02.421
to the manual.

07:02.421 --> 07:03.506
>> That's a good plan.

07:03.506 --> 07:05.508
>> Look, this is not
about a book, all right.

07:05.508 --> 07:08.553
This is about learning
how to drive a vehicle safely.

07:08.553 --> 07:10.263
>> Si, there are rules
of driving that

07:10.263 --> 07:11.305
you have to know.

07:11.305 --> 07:12.890
>> Hey, you don't
have to tell me.

07:12.890 --> 07:15.101
It's a jungle out
there on the highway.

07:15.101 --> 07:17.520
The boy's gotta
know jungle rules, okay?

07:17.520 --> 07:19.313
>> You're not going
to teach him to drive.

07:19.313 --> 07:20.898
>> I think this is
a good idea.

07:20.898 --> 07:22.692
It'll be good practice
for Will.

07:22.692 --> 07:24.068
All right, fine.
You got a deal.

07:24.068 --> 07:25.403
>> All right, go ahead.

07:25.403 --> 07:27.238
Drive home there, buddy.

07:27.238 --> 07:28.364
We'll pick
you up tomorrow,

07:28.364 --> 07:30.575
if we remember to
think about it.

07:30.575 --> 07:31.951
>> You better study, Si.

07:31.951 --> 07:32.910
>> By the way,

07:32.910 --> 07:34.245
what time ya'll picking
me up tomorrow?

07:34.245 --> 07:35.454
I'll text you.

07:35.454 --> 07:37.498
Hey, you know
I don't text.

07:46.257 --> 07:47.675
All right, we
gotta go through

07:47.675 --> 07:49.343
the night like ghosts.

07:49.343 --> 07:50.887
Like shadow hunters?

07:50.887 --> 07:51.846
>> Yeah, that's it.

07:51.846 --> 07:54.056
Me and you are gonna
be shadow hunters.

07:54.056 --> 07:55.474
This is kind of like
war paint.

07:55.474 --> 07:58.978
Brings out your sense to
put food on the table.

07:58.978 --> 08:00.646
What are ya'll doing?

08:00.646 --> 08:01.689
>> We're getting fired up.

08:01.689 --> 08:03.983
>> Aw.
Mia, you look mean.

08:05.067 --> 08:07.320
>> This is mainly for
if we run up on people...

08:07.320 --> 08:08.196
who are yuppies.

08:08.196 --> 08:09.071
And they're wondering
what we're

08:09.071 --> 08:10.114
doing out here
in the pond.

08:10.114 --> 08:11.532
>> Just yell Jep, Mia,

08:11.532 --> 08:12.325
if somebody walks out.

08:12.325 --> 08:13.951
Just say,
"Get down, Jep!"

08:13.951 --> 08:16.621
>> When in doubt,
blame a bearded man.

08:16.871 --> 08:18.331
>> I mean, I'm
always worried

08:18.331 --> 08:21.083
and a little nervous
about safety.

08:21.083 --> 08:22.835
But then, I know how
good your dad

08:22.835 --> 08:24.003
is about all that.

08:24.003 --> 08:24.962
>> Yeah.

08:24.962 --> 08:26.047
>> So, I love it.

08:26.047 --> 08:28.216
I think the experience
out weighs anything else.

08:28.216 --> 08:30.843
Okay, well, she's
got school, so...

08:30.843 --> 08:31.844
>> Mom.

08:31.844 --> 08:33.054
>> Look, I don't
expect to kill him

08:33.054 --> 08:37.850
the first night,
but if I see him...

08:37.850 --> 08:38.434
>> Okay, babe.

08:38.434 --> 08:41.103
>> Pow!
>> Jase!

08:41.437 --> 08:42.688
>> That's all of it.

08:42.688 --> 08:44.065
Plus, when you
start dating,

08:44.065 --> 08:45.775
if you can use
a crossbow,

08:45.775 --> 08:47.151
that's gonna be helpful.

08:47.151 --> 08:48.402
>> Okay, we're
changing the subject.

08:48.402 --> 08:50.696
>> If he ever has any kind
of unwanted advance,

08:50.696 --> 08:51.697
you say,

08:51.697 --> 08:52.657
"You know I know how
to use a crossbow."

08:52.657 --> 08:53.616
>> Dad.

08:53.616 --> 08:56.327
>> He gone.

08:58.037 --> 08:59.372
>> See, you can
use that line.

08:59.372 --> 09:00.665
>> Look, I gotta get
a picture though,

09:00.665 --> 09:02.083
cause this is your
first beaver hunt.

09:02.083 --> 09:03.000
>> Really?

09:03.000 --> 09:04.168
>> Take a picture
of her down there

09:04.168 --> 09:05.002
with the beaver.

09:05.002 --> 09:05.670
>> Bye.

09:05.670 --> 09:06.754
>> Don't wait up for us.

09:06.754 --> 09:08.297
>> Good luck, have fun,
and catch that beaver!

09:08.297 --> 09:09.840
>> Baby, you don't
catch beavers.

09:09.840 --> 09:10.508
You kill 'em.

09:10.508 --> 09:11.509
You kill 'em.

09:11.509 --> 09:12.843
>> Okay, well kill
that beaver.

09:12.843 --> 09:13.594
Bye.

09:13.594 --> 09:15.096
>> Have fun.

09:16.681 --> 09:18.474
What was that?
Something moved.

09:18.474 --> 09:19.433
Hey, we're in
the woods,

09:19.433 --> 09:20.518
things move.

09:20.518 --> 09:21.852
Look at that,
that's a track.

09:21.852 --> 09:23.688
>> Looks like blood,
old blood kind of.

09:23.688 --> 09:26.440
>> They make these
little scent mounds.

09:26.440 --> 09:28.359
They poop and pee
all over them,

09:28.359 --> 09:30.611
and they tell everybody
this is our territory.

09:30.611 --> 09:31.696
That's what we're
looking for.

09:31.696 --> 09:32.780
>> Ew.

09:32.780 --> 09:34.907
Everything
leaves trails.

09:34.907 --> 09:37.201
What's the first
thing you look for?

09:37.201 --> 09:39.203
Poop.
>> Poop.

09:39.203 --> 09:40.329
See right there?

09:40.329 --> 09:41.580
See where he's been gnawing
on the tre right ther?

09:41.580 --> 09:42.915
>> Do they not
have taste buds?

09:42.915 --> 09:45.001
There's like baby
trees or something-

09:45.001 --> 09:45.918
>> Yup.

09:45.918 --> 09:46.877
>> And they like
eat 'em and turns

09:46.877 --> 09:48.087
like yellowish color.

09:48.087 --> 09:48.838
>> That's right.

09:48.838 --> 09:49.880
>> It's kind of disgusting.

09:49.880 --> 09:51.048
Let's keep going.
We're getting close.

09:51.048 --> 09:52.508
This is what we're looking for.

09:52.967 --> 09:54.218
I think there's
more poop right there.

09:54.218 --> 09:57.096
I hate that it
smells like pee and poop.

09:57.096 --> 09:58.306
>> There'll come
a time in your life

09:58.306 --> 10:00.558
when you'll cherish
that smell.

10:00.558 --> 10:02.310
>> I m good.
Nope, nope.

10:18.326 --> 10:19.368
>> Mia!

10:19.368 --> 10:20.494
>> Sorry.

10:20.494 --> 10:21.912
>> Oh, he's gone now.

10:21.912 --> 10:24.165
When they're alarmed,

10:24.165 --> 10:26.000
they slap their
tail on the water.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.336
>> Why can't we
just wait it out?

10:28.336 --> 10:29.503
>> Because the
neighbors probably

10:29.503 --> 10:32.590
just said,
"Did you hear that scream?"

10:32.590 --> 10:34.050
Every story you've
ever seen that's bad,

10:34.050 --> 10:35.968
starts off with,
"I heard a scream."

10:35.968 --> 10:37.178
>> But it's scary!

10:37.178 --> 10:38.179
>> Now don't fret.

10:38.179 --> 10:39.680
Cause we're gonna
come back...

10:39.680 --> 10:41.182
he's going down.

10:41.849 --> 10:42.725
Well, your mom
will be happy,

10:42.725 --> 10:44.101
it's not too late.

10:44.101 --> 10:46.354
You gotta train yourself.
No screaming.

10:46.354 --> 10:48.814
>> Copy that.
No screaming.

10:51.400 --> 10:53.444
ic music]
>> Whoa.

10:54.612 --> 10:55.279
Hey.

10:55.279 --> 10:56.364
Idiot.

10:58.199 --> 11:00.117
Hiyah!

11:00.451 --> 11:01.577
All right,
ya'll ready?

11:01.577 --> 11:03.704
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:03.704 --> 11:05.039
Put your seatbelt
on first.

11:05.039 --> 11:06.499
Safety always first.

11:06.499 --> 11:07.291
>> That's one point off.

11:07.291 --> 11:08.292
>> Will-

11:08.292 --> 11:10.461
Technically I didn't
put it in drive yet.

11:10.461 --> 11:12.421
>> Wait, hold on,
one more thing.

11:12.421 --> 11:13.506
Gotta check your mirrors.

11:13.506 --> 11:15.841
>> Gotta check and see
if there's any children.

11:16.675 --> 11:17.927
Whoa.
Minus two points.

11:17.927 --> 11:19.637
Too heavy on
the gas pedal.

11:20.096 --> 11:21.722
You are not fit to
teach this young man

11:21.722 --> 11:23.099
how to drive because
you've had

11:23.099 --> 11:24.016
too many accidents.

11:24.016 --> 11:24.850
You've run over--
back into me in

11:24.850 --> 11:26.852
the parking lot in
my own truck.

11:26.852 --> 11:27.561
>> All right.

11:27.561 --> 11:28.771
Whoa.

11:28.771 --> 11:30.689
Si, I haven't had a wreck
in like twenty years.

11:30.689 --> 11:32.233
I'm docking you
three points.

11:32.233 --> 11:33.192
>> For what?!

11:33.192 --> 11:34.819
>> Going too far
past the stop sign.

11:34.819 --> 11:36.529
Another minus one,
no blinker.

11:36.529 --> 11:37.571
>> Will, you have to
turn on a blinker

11:37.571 --> 11:38.280
on to turn?

11:38.280 --> 11:39.115
Oh yeah,

11:39.115 --> 11:40.074
you gotta put your
blinker on.

11:40.074 --> 11:41.867
You was teaching
Sadie how to drive,

11:41.867 --> 11:44.078
and she run
over everything-

11:45.454 --> 11:47.206
-in the Duck Commander
parking lot.

11:47.206 --> 11:48.082
>> Not true.

11:50.793 --> 11:52.711
>> Will, I'm hands down,
the best driving teacher.

11:52.711 --> 11:54.964
>> Oh, I'm docking you
two points for driving

11:54.964 --> 11:56.257
with one hand.

11:56.257 --> 11:57.425
>> What are you
talking about?

11:57.425 --> 11:59.677
>> It says it right here,
in section B-

11:59.677 --> 12:00.803
>> Section B!

12:00.803 --> 12:03.639
>> On page 23.
>> 23, boy.

12:03.639 --> 12:04.849
If he teaches you
how to drive,

12:04.849 --> 12:06.892
West Monroe is
fixin' to turn into

12:06.892 --> 12:08.686
a demolition derby.

12:08.686 --> 12:10.688
>> That be actually
pretty fun.

12:10.688 --> 12:12.773
>> Well, hey, he's your
man then.

12:12.773 --> 12:14.442
All right, Uncle Si,
it's your turn.

12:14.442 --> 12:15.359
>> All right.

12:15.359 --> 12:17.445
First thing's first.
Safety first.

12:17.445 --> 12:19.196
Safety first, boys.

12:19.196 --> 12:20.823
>> Now, okay,
check the mirrors,

12:20.823 --> 12:22.241
okay, yup,
mmm-hmm.

12:22.241 --> 12:23.659
Turn the blinker on.

12:26.120 --> 12:27.079
Hey!

12:27.079 --> 12:28.581
This thing's got a little
power, boy.

12:28.581 --> 12:30.541
>> All right, that's minus
ten points.

12:30.541 --> 12:31.375
>> There you go.

12:31.375 --> 12:32.668
>> What?!

12:32.668 --> 12:34.503
>> For going way over
the speed limit.

12:34.503 --> 12:36.046
>> No, hold it,
hold it, no.

12:36.046 --> 12:38.048
>> Si is insane driver.

12:38.048 --> 12:39.675
>> No, no.

12:39.675 --> 12:43.095
>> My driving record is
relatively unscathed.

12:43.095 --> 12:44.555
>> Mine is...

12:44.555 --> 12:46.265
zero-scathed. Okay.

12:46.265 --> 12:47.516
>> I've only had one
bad one.

12:47.516 --> 12:48.893
>> I ain't have none.

12:48.893 --> 12:50.686
>> Dock him for
crossing the white line

12:50.686 --> 12:51.687
on the right.

12:51.687 --> 12:53.230
>> What do you mean
cross the white line?

12:54.356 --> 12:55.566
>> All right, that's minus
five points for you.

12:55.566 --> 12:57.026
>> What do you mean
minus?

12:57.026 --> 13:00.446
I've been driving since I
been about four months old.

13:00.696 --> 13:01.447
>> Huh?

13:01.447 --> 13:02.239
>> What?

13:02.239 --> 13:03.115
>> Yeah.

13:03.115 --> 13:05.326
My dad use to seat
me in his lap,

13:05.326 --> 13:06.911
in the old Model T.

13:07.411 --> 13:11.624
Look, we're fixin' to pull,
what is known as a u-turn.

13:12.082 --> 13:13.459
Starting right now...

13:13.459 --> 13:15.252
then here's the "u"
part of it.

13:15.252 --> 13:16.212
That's a circle.

13:16.212 --> 13:17.963
>> So we're making
what is known as,

13:17.963 --> 13:19.757
a circle turn.

13:19.757 --> 13:23.052
Minus twenty points.
Woo!

13:23.052 --> 13:24.261
>> This is the guy
you want teaching

13:24.261 --> 13:25.513
you how to drive.

13:26.430 --> 13:27.932
>> I don't even
know anymore.

13:30.976 --> 13:31.852
So what do
you got,

13:31.852 --> 13:33.354
I see you
"tabelizing" there.

13:33.354 --> 13:35.648
>> Both of ya'll
flunk the test.

13:35.648 --> 13:36.649
>> What?!

13:36.649 --> 13:37.942
>> We've had our
drivers license for way

13:37.942 --> 13:39.068
longer than you have.

13:39.068 --> 13:40.402
>> Well, what are we
going to do now?

13:40.402 --> 13:41.529
>> Actually.
I have an idea.

13:41.529 --> 13:42.738
>> What's that?

13:42.738 --> 13:44.907
>> We can go to Excalibur

13:44.907 --> 13:46.825
and go ride the go-karts.

13:46.825 --> 13:47.910
Now we're talking.

13:47.910 --> 13:49.662
Oh please, no.

13:57.586 --> 13:58.754
Look,
there's ripples.

14:08.347 --> 14:09.682
>> The good thing
about beavers along

14:09.682 --> 14:11.016
with most critters,

14:11.016 --> 14:13.185
is they have
terrible memories.

14:13.185 --> 14:14.895
You give them
a night off,

14:14.895 --> 14:17.106
next night they're
back to doing the

14:17.106 --> 14:18.607
same thing they
been doing.

14:18.607 --> 14:21.569
>> Yeah, the Shadow Hunters
never miss their target.

14:21.569 --> 14:23.362
At least not the
second time.

14:38.335 --> 14:39.712
>> Yeah, he's thrashing.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.005
I believe I got him.

14:41.005 --> 14:43.215
That was a good spot.

14:43.215 --> 14:44.550
>> I learned that
beavers sink.

14:44.550 --> 14:46.427
So you have to like,
if you shoot it,

14:46.427 --> 14:48.554
you have to go in the
water to get it.

14:48.554 --> 14:49.805
>> You either have
to get 'em quick,

14:49.805 --> 14:51.557
or you have to shoot
'em in shallow water.

14:51.557 --> 14:53.100
Cause they sink
like a rock.

14:53.100 --> 14:54.184
>> But I don't get it-

14:54.184 --> 14:56.312
They poop show much,
why aren't they skinny?

14:57.938 --> 14:59.648
>> That's a valid point.

15:00.524 --> 15:01.817
Oh yeah.

15:02.151 --> 15:03.277
>> Ew.

15:03.277 --> 15:05.112
>> Hey, you know that
sound you heard,

15:05.112 --> 15:06.322
that's what did it
right there.

15:06.322 --> 15:07.698
>> Dad, be quiet.

15:07.698 --> 15:09.450
There could be a UYO.

15:09.742 --> 15:11.285
>> You wanna carry him?
>> I'm good.

15:11.285 --> 15:12.536
>> Okay.

15:12.536 --> 15:14.830
Congratulations
on your first beaver hunt.

15:14.830 --> 15:16.999
The first of many.

15:18.042 --> 15:19.376
There, knock
on the door.

15:20.169 --> 15:22.171
There you go,
that's good.

15:23.047 --> 15:23.964
Hi, guys.

15:23.964 --> 15:25.424
Hey, good news.
Lookie here.

15:25.424 --> 15:28.052
>> Oh, is that thing
bleeding on my front porch?

15:28.052 --> 15:29.595
>> Oh, yeah.

15:34.141 --> 15:35.267
>> We got 'em.

15:35.267 --> 15:36.602
>> You could've
just sent me a picture.

15:36.602 --> 15:37.895
>> Well, I needed
the proof of death.

15:37.895 --> 15:40.230
We had a deal.
Here he lays.

15:40.230 --> 15:42.149
>> There's blood,
all over the front porch.

15:42.149 --> 15:44.193
>> Here's my part
of the deal.

15:44.193 --> 15:45.194
>> That's awesome.

15:45.194 --> 15:46.862
>> And we did it
in the shadows.

15:46.862 --> 15:47.571
>> We did.

15:47.571 --> 15:48.947
>> We were discreet.

15:49.865 --> 15:51.033
So here's my plan.

15:51.033 --> 15:52.785
They're now gonna
say nothing about

15:52.785 --> 15:54.161
dumping bacon
grease,

15:54.161 --> 15:56.205
but if I get rid of
this carcass,

15:56.205 --> 15:57.289
then I might
be able to get

15:57.289 --> 15:58.290
a little something extra.

15:58.290 --> 15:59.875
All right,
enjoy the beaver.

15:59.875 --> 16:00.793
>> Oh, whoa!

16:00.793 --> 16:02.211
What am I suppose
to do with this?

16:02.211 --> 16:03.629
>> There's always
a problem.

16:03.629 --> 16:04.838
And guess who
they're gonna call?

16:04.838 --> 16:05.673
>> You.

16:05.673 --> 16:06.840
>> Jase-buster.

16:07.800 --> 16:08.842
>> Maybe we should
change our name from

16:08.842 --> 16:11.470
Shadow Hunters to
Shadow Busters.

16:11.470 --> 16:12.721
>> Nah.

16:12.721 --> 16:14.390
>> Well, disposal
is extra.

16:14.390 --> 16:17.184
Our deal was for me
to shoot the beaver.

16:17.184 --> 16:18.602
I shot the beaver.

16:20.062 --> 16:22.356
>> I mean I like-
We're the hunters.

16:22.356 --> 16:23.232
We just hunted something.

16:23.232 --> 16:25.234
We didn't buster something.

16:25.234 --> 16:26.235
>> Let me see...

16:26.235 --> 16:27.736
Who you gonna call?
Shadow Hunters.

16:27.736 --> 16:29.446
Yeah that works.
That works real good.

16:29.446 --> 16:30.280
>> No.

16:30.280 --> 16:31.573
We don't need
a theme song.

16:32.908 --> 16:34.118
I'm kind of
thinking now if you

16:34.118 --> 16:36.078
want to take care
of this beaver,

16:36.078 --> 16:36.995
then maybe,

16:36.995 --> 16:38.747
every year when I
burn my leaves,

16:38.747 --> 16:40.165
ya'll look the other way.

16:40.165 --> 16:41.250
>> What-
What about this?

16:41.250 --> 16:42.334
Do it in your back yard.

16:42.334 --> 16:43.335
Whatever happens
in the back yard,

16:43.335 --> 16:44.253
stays in the
back yard.

16:44.253 --> 16:45.087
>> Deal!

16:45.087 --> 16:45.838
>> Good.

16:45.838 --> 16:46.839
>> What about
the chickens?!

16:46.839 --> 16:48.090
>> Mr. Robertson,
thank you so much.

16:48.090 --> 16:49.258
>> Appreciate it.

16:49.258 --> 16:50.592
All right,
come on Mia.

16:50.592 --> 16:51.552
>> Ya'll have
a good evening.

16:51.552 --> 16:55.764
We'll take care of that later.
Thank you.

16:55.764 --> 17:00.561
itar music]

17:01.687 --> 17:02.646
All right, guys,

17:02.646 --> 17:05.941
this is the ultimate
driving test.

17:05.941 --> 17:07.359
This is a go-kart race.

17:07.359 --> 17:10.195
>> We're going ten laps
around this whole track-

17:10.195 --> 17:11.572
I thought we's was
going a hundred,

17:11.572 --> 17:12.656
grand prix style.

17:12.656 --> 17:13.824
>> Si, we're not
going hundred laps,

17:13.824 --> 17:14.658
we're going five.

17:14.658 --> 17:15.701
Five laps.

17:15.701 --> 17:17.244
>> I can do five in
my sleep, buddy.

17:17.244 --> 17:18.037
Five laps,

17:18.037 --> 17:19.371
but it's a race
to the death.

17:19.371 --> 17:20.456
Or at least,

17:20.456 --> 17:22.332
you have to break
something or be bleeding.

17:22.332 --> 17:23.083
>> He's gonna
be bleeding.

17:23.083 --> 17:23.834
Trust me.

17:23.834 --> 17:24.918
I'm gonna put
him the wall.

17:24.918 --> 17:25.794
>> Si!

17:25.794 --> 17:26.670
>> Somebody's gotta
lose a finger.

17:26.670 --> 17:27.671
>> Uh-oh.

17:27.671 --> 17:28.839
Hat's backwards,
look out.

17:28.839 --> 17:30.174
>> I got wall on
my mind,

17:30.174 --> 17:31.884
and I want Willie...

17:31.884 --> 17:32.760
>> What is your problem?

17:32.760 --> 17:33.761
>> To smack it.

17:33.761 --> 17:36.013
>> Me and Si failed
Will's driving test.

17:36.013 --> 17:38.015
So now, we're going
to race go-karts

17:38.015 --> 17:39.600
to prove who's the
better driver.

17:39.600 --> 17:40.851
>> Are we gonna do
this or what?!

17:40.851 --> 17:42.936
>> I got my money
on the old crazy one.

17:42.936 --> 17:44.521
>> Ha!

17:44.521 --> 17:46.064
>> If that wasn't
crazy enough,

17:46.064 --> 17:48.025
the guys have placed
obstacles from the

17:48.025 --> 17:50.652
warehouse on the track
to make it more realistic.

17:50.652 --> 17:52.112
>> This is gonna
prove nothing.

17:52.112 --> 17:53.655
>> I feel the need...

17:53.655 --> 17:55.157
For speed, boys.

17:55.157 --> 17:56.992
>> Look, the only reason
I agreed to this

17:56.992 --> 17:58.160
stupide go-kart idea,

17:58.160 --> 18:00.496
was I wanted to show
Little Will that it takes

18:00.496 --> 18:01.580
real skill to drive.

18:01.580 --> 18:03.165
Will, I can't believe
you talked me into this.

18:03.165 --> 18:05.167
>> I can't believe
you even got in the kart!

18:06.710 --> 18:08.170
>> I just I hope
I'm not gonna be teaching

18:08.170 --> 18:10.672
Little Will how to
drive from a gurney.

18:10.672 --> 18:12.883
Ready. Set. Go!

18:14.009 --> 18:15.886
>> Uh-oh.
Willie's is dead.

18:17.054 --> 18:18.180
>> He got loose!

18:18.180 --> 18:19.389
>> Look at him.
Taunting.

18:19.389 --> 18:21.016
>> Oh, he's taunting
him now.

18:21.016 --> 18:23.018
>> Getting beat by
a ninety year old man.

18:25.062 --> 18:26.188
>> Hey, Willie don't
understand what he

18:26.188 --> 18:28.023
just got himself into.

18:28.023 --> 18:31.068
This is combat driving...
to the death.

18:31.735 --> 18:34.488
Two men enter,
one man leaves.

18:35.823 --> 18:38.534
>> Oh, he put
a move on him.

18:38.534 --> 18:39.326
>> No!

18:39.326 --> 18:40.327
>> He put a move on him.

18:40.327 --> 18:41.370
>> We got a race.

18:42.454 --> 18:44.915
>> Whoa!

18:47.793 --> 18:49.837
>> Something tells
me Si must have like

18:49.837 --> 18:50.921
a life time pass
out here.

18:50.921 --> 18:52.297
>> Yeah!

18:53.841 --> 18:57.553
>> Shiny and chrome.
Valhalla awaits.

18:58.554 --> 19:00.138
>> Last lap!

19:01.056 --> 19:02.224
>> Oh, look, look, look.

19:02.224 --> 19:03.934
>> Uh-oh. Willie
make a run on the outside.

19:03.934 --> 19:05.310
>> Oh no.

19:05.853 --> 19:07.855
Put him
in the statue.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.878
>> Oh, no!

19:31.211 --> 19:32.880
>> Pay me my money.

19:32.880 --> 19:35.674
>> Hey, he cheated.

19:36.884 --> 19:37.759
>> It's all over.

19:37.759 --> 19:39.595
And the grand prix winner...

19:39.595 --> 19:40.679
>> Silas!

19:40.679 --> 19:42.347
>> Yours truly.

19:42.347 --> 19:43.140
>> Boom, baby.

19:43.140 --> 19:44.349
>> That was a dirty move.

19:44.349 --> 19:45.851
>> What do you mean
a dirty move?

19:45.851 --> 19:47.477
That's the only move.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.354
>> I have learned
a lot from what

19:49.354 --> 19:50.355
you have taught me,

19:50.355 --> 19:52.649
but i have come up
with my teacher.

19:52.649 --> 19:54.401
>> Who?

19:54.401 --> 19:55.527
>> John Luke.

19:55.527 --> 19:57.654
>> That's the stupidost
idea I've ever heard.

19:57.654 --> 19:58.989
>> That's the plan now.

19:58.989 --> 20:00.240
>> That's the worst idea ever.

20:00.240 --> 20:02.492
John Luke's had five
wrecks in like a year.

20:02.492 --> 20:04.411
>> He rolled his
dad's pick-up.

20:04.411 --> 20:05.913
>> He's totaled
one of my trucks.

20:05.913 --> 20:08.373
>> Well, those who
can't do, teach.

20:08.707 --> 20:09.708
>> Oh boy.

20:09.708 --> 20:10.667
>> That's fine by me.

20:10.667 --> 20:11.835
>> I'll give you three
more laps.

20:11.835 --> 20:13.003
>> Double or nothing,
come on.

20:13.003 --> 20:14.212
>> Oh boy.

20:14.212 --> 20:15.672
>> Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Double or nothing?

20:15.672 --> 20:16.673
Double or nothing,

20:16.673 --> 20:17.925
make a new bet boys!

20:18.467 --> 20:19.801
>> Go, Si!
Hurry up

20:19.801 --> 20:20.594
Hey!

20:20.594 --> 20:22.054
What you doing,
knuckle head!?

20:22.054 --> 20:24.014
>> Eat my dust, old man.

20:30.228 --> 20:31.730
All right,
ya'll bow.

20:31.730 --> 20:33.190
Thank you Father for
another day.

20:33.190 --> 20:35.192
Thank you for the good
food you blessed us with.

20:35.192 --> 20:37.527
I pray, Father, we do
what is right

20:37.527 --> 20:39.237
in all circumstances.

20:39.237 --> 20:40.572
And we love our brothers.

20:40.572 --> 20:41.698
In the name of
Jesus, amen.

20:41.698 --> 20:42.532
Amen!

20:42.532 --> 20:44.201
Lets eat, boys.

20:44.201 --> 20:45.327
>> Let's get on it.

20:45.661 --> 20:46.745
When you're
raising kids,

20:46.745 --> 20:48.997
or trying to co-exist
with your neighbors,

20:48.997 --> 20:51.917
sometimes you have to
make some compromises.

20:51.917 --> 20:53.835
Which may mean starting
new traditions,

20:53.835 --> 20:56.338
like a father daughter
beaver hunt.

20:56.338 --> 20:57.506
Or ending old ones,

20:57.506 --> 21:00.175
like a father teaching
their kids how to drive.

21:00.175 --> 21:01.802
Even though you
might feel a little

21:01.802 --> 21:03.512
bit like you're
being replaced,

21:03.512 --> 21:05.347
the most important
thing is you're spending

21:05.347 --> 21:06.890
quality time with
your family.

21:06.890 --> 21:09.685
And that's something
that can never be replaced.

21:09.685 --> 21:11.728
I can't believe Will
picked John Luke.

21:11.728 --> 21:13.563
Hey, it could've
been worse.

21:13.563 --> 21:14.564
- He could've picked Korie.
- True.
