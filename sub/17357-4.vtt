WEBVTT

00:06.712 --> 00:08.838
See? You were right. That Pacalioglu guy

00:08.840 --> 00:11.429
was there the day before your séance.

00:11.431 --> 00:13.323
- I knew it!
- But there's more.

00:13.324 --> 00:15.483
Right when they entered the gallery,

00:15.484 --> 00:17.710
the camera stops recording.

00:17.711 --> 00:20.567
That must have been when they
tampered the lights bulbs.

00:20.569 --> 00:22.461
What else do we know about this guy?

00:22.462 --> 00:24.753
It seems he's fashioned
himself a little ghost hut

00:24.755 --> 00:27.612
out of an abandoned newsstand.

00:27.614 --> 00:30.535
What are you scheming?

00:30.537 --> 00:34.192
What's going on inside
that chubby brain of yours?

00:39.341 --> 00:41.701
Yes! Three hours without moving!

00:41.701 --> 00:45.189
A new record! P.R. it all over the place.

00:45.190 --> 00:47.948
To the victor go the spoils.

00:49.211 --> 00:50.574
Oh, what...?

00:52.070 --> 00:54.495
- Aah! Oh, God!
- Aah!

01:02.038 --> 01:06.025
Hey, buddy. What are you supposed to be?

01:06.025 --> 01:08.118
You're like a little blob creature?

01:08.119 --> 01:10.011
- Chips.
- No. No, no.

01:10.013 --> 01:11.640
This is living people food.

01:11.640 --> 01:13.367
- It won't take.
- Please?

01:13.369 --> 01:16.855
Oh, cute. Okay, fine. Fine. Here.

01:16.857 --> 01:18.983
Yay!

01:20.579 --> 01:24.100
Whoa! How are you eating that?

01:24.101 --> 01:25.462
Bye.

01:25.464 --> 01:26.925
Oh! Hey, no!

01:26.925 --> 01:28.885
Get back here, you little scamp!

01:28.887 --> 01:32.540
Come on... Aw! I was eating those.

01:34.370 --> 01:36.994
I don't believe that guy.

01:39.520 --> 01:42.111
Oh, God!

01:42.111 --> 01:44.802
Excuse me. Hi, there.

01:44.803 --> 01:46.431
Oh, hi, there. Oh.

01:46.431 --> 01:48.091
I thought these were classics.

01:48.092 --> 01:49.421
But they're flaming hot.

01:49.421 --> 01:51.281
Ooh!

01:51.281 --> 01:54.737
Oh, God. Oh.

01:54.737 --> 01:56.797
Okay, I'm sorry. Okay.

01:56.799 --> 01:58.823
Here we go. Ahem.

01:58.825 --> 02:01.017
Under control. How can I help you?

02:01.019 --> 02:03.076
Well, it says here that
you deal with ghosts.

02:03.078 --> 02:06.234
Is that real or is that like a joke?

02:06.234 --> 02:08.394
No, that's real. Why, is it funny?

02:08.394 --> 02:10.621
No, no. And I know funny.

02:10.621 --> 02:13.843
I'm Darcy Baldo. I own the
Big Apple Comedy Shack.

02:13.844 --> 02:16.269
Oh, my God. That is my favorite
comedy club in New York.

02:16.269 --> 02:18.362
All right! I've never seen the stand-up

02:18.364 --> 02:20.123
but the chili cheeseburgers are fantastic.

02:20.123 --> 02:22.749
Well, we have the same
chef as the Laugh Factory.

02:22.749 --> 02:24.909
I know. Ha-ha!

02:24.909 --> 02:28.031
Here's the deal. I think
my club is haunted.

02:28.033 --> 02:30.158
Oh. The weirdness only happens

02:30.158 --> 02:32.186
really late at night after I close down.

02:32.187 --> 02:35.275
So I was wondering if you
could come by and maybe

02:35.277 --> 02:37.602
- check it out?
- Yeah. I could swing that.

02:37.602 --> 02:40.061
Oh, fantastic! Great.
You don't, by any chance,

02:40.061 --> 02:42.021
charge extra for late-night gigs, do you?

02:42.021 --> 02:44.745
I hadn't actually ever thought of that.

02:44.746 --> 02:46.872
- Uh, good idea. Can I?
- Ah.

02:46.874 --> 02:49.164
No. Just forget I mentioned that.

02:49.166 --> 02:50.992
- Bad idea.
- Yeah.

02:50.994 --> 02:52.886
- Forgotten.
- Great.

02:52.888 --> 02:54.582
So I'll see you later tonight.

02:54.582 --> 02:55.678
For what?

02:57.000 --> 03:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:34.490 --> 03:37.711
No, no, $50 to see.

03:37.713 --> 03:39.273
- I'm giving you 45.
- Fifty.

03:39.273 --> 03:41.634
It's 45. Take it.

03:47.813 --> 03:49.274
Isn't that...?

03:49.276 --> 03:51.336
That's my new client, Anal Bead.

03:51.336 --> 03:53.661
- He loves dope.
- Oh.

03:55.491 --> 03:57.216
- How you doin', Pac?
- Good.

03:57.218 --> 03:58.613
How's business?

03:58.613 --> 03:59.908
Everything's great. Can't complain.

03:59.910 --> 04:02.866
I have a gig tonight at a comedy club.

04:02.866 --> 04:05.556
It's an all-night thing. I was
wondering if you have uppers.

04:05.558 --> 04:08.646
Oh. So I'm assuming I'll
put this on your tab?

04:08.648 --> 04:11.174
Yeah, or you could put it on my hand.

04:13.401 --> 04:15.292
Yo, just be careful with that stuff, man.

04:15.292 --> 04:16.856
You know how you get.

04:22.307 --> 04:25.295
Okay. All right, might as
well get comfortable, huh?

04:25.296 --> 04:28.219
Sometimes these ghosts can take
their sweet-ass time showing up.

04:28.219 --> 04:30.578
Know what I mean, know what
I mean, know what I mean?

04:30.578 --> 04:33.135
So why don't we rap, huh? What's your name?

04:33.137 --> 04:34.998
We covered that. It's Darcy, isn't it?

04:34.998 --> 04:36.658
Is it Darcy, is it D'arcy?

04:36.659 --> 04:38.984
- No, it's just Darcy.
- Just Darcy, all right.

04:38.986 --> 04:41.244
What's your zodiac sign? Any
pets? What're their signs?

04:41.246 --> 04:43.172
How many men have you slept with?

04:43.172 --> 04:46.261
- Just lock up when you leave.
- Can do. Can do.

04:46.263 --> 04:47.557
- Okay. All right.
- Eee!

04:47.559 --> 04:49.487
Ugh!

04:54.470 --> 04:57.161
Unh! Wow.

05:07.793 --> 05:10.776
Ladies and gentlemen, would you
please welcome to the stage,

05:10.778 --> 05:12.538
Buddy Silvers.

05:12.539 --> 05:14.737
Ha-ha-ha! Hi.

05:14.739 --> 05:16.598
Thank you. Thank you.

05:16.598 --> 05:18.060
Thank you, ladies and
gentlemen. Thank you very much.

05:18.062 --> 05:19.822
And thank you especially.

05:19.823 --> 05:21.512
My wife was the romantic
one in our relationship.

05:21.514 --> 05:24.100
I have to say she said,
"Buddy, listen to me.

05:24.110 --> 05:26.229
"When we die, I want us
to come back us ghosts

05:26.231 --> 05:29.623
and haunt the place where
we had our first date."

05:29.623 --> 05:31.712
I said, "honey, I sold that car years ago."

05:33.245 --> 05:35.571
We'll just do our date, let me tell you.

05:35.573 --> 05:37.194
I finally figured out the
secret to a happy marriage.

05:37.195 --> 05:40.448
One of you has to die, huh?

05:40.458 --> 05:42.845
My wife wasn't much of a
cook, you know what I mean?

05:42.847 --> 05:45.005
But she did have a tuna
casserole that was to die for.

05:45.005 --> 05:47.761
I found out the hard way.

05:47.761 --> 05:49.155
How do you think I got here?

05:49.165 --> 05:51.452
Thank you very much. Thank you, everybody.

05:51.452 --> 05:53.681
I'm Buddy Silvers. I will be here all week.

05:53.682 --> 05:55.043
And the next week and the week after that.

05:55.045 --> 05:56.665
I'll be here for eternity.

05:56.667 --> 05:58.695
Good night, everybody. Thank you.

05:58.696 --> 06:00.726
Oh!

06:00.726 --> 06:03.879
It's funny because it's true.

06:03.881 --> 06:06.705
Oh-ho. Hey, thanks, Jim. Oh, yeah.

06:09.034 --> 06:11.790
Hi, uh, Buddy?

06:11.790 --> 06:13.879
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to bother you

06:13.879 --> 06:17.471
but I wanted to come over and
tell you that that was really,

06:17.472 --> 06:20.395
- really something.
- You kidding? The crowd was dead.

06:20.397 --> 06:23.282
Thank you very much.

06:23.282 --> 06:25.411
That guy never takes a break, huh?

06:25.411 --> 06:26.803
So listen, do you mind if I sit down?

06:26.804 --> 06:29.500
- Suit yourself.
- Thanks.

06:29.500 --> 06:32.554
My name is Kevin Pacalioglu
and I'm actually a medium.

06:32.556 --> 06:35.410
I'm here to help you move on.

06:35.411 --> 06:37.638
You have to have something,
some unfinished business,

06:37.640 --> 06:39.528
or you wouldn't be
trapped here every night.

06:39.530 --> 06:40.833
- Trapped?
- Yeah.

06:40.834 --> 06:42.654
Are you kidding? It's a great gig.

06:42.654 --> 06:44.683
I'm only here every
night because I wanna be.

06:44.683 --> 06:46.573
And besides, you know,

06:46.575 --> 06:49.369
being a ghost is better
than what's waiting for me

06:49.371 --> 06:51.697
on the other side of that
light, I'll tell you that.

06:51.699 --> 06:53.857
- And what's that?
- My wife.

06:53.857 --> 06:56.474
That wasn't a joke.

06:56.485 --> 06:59.100
Seriously, she scares the hell out of me.

06:59.102 --> 07:01.658
So you just don't want to move on?

07:01.669 --> 07:04.155
I'm having the time of my afterlife here.

07:13.657 --> 07:15.616
So how did it go?

07:15.618 --> 07:18.144
Your ghost is a former
comedian named Buddy Silvers.

07:18.146 --> 07:21.000
He does this bit about his wife.

07:21.001 --> 07:24.423
He's so good.

07:24.424 --> 07:26.352
It's coming non-stop.

07:26.354 --> 07:28.313
Yeah, I remember a Buddy Silvers.

07:28.314 --> 07:31.299
He was a headliner up in the
Catskills back in the '60s.

07:31.309 --> 07:34.224
Well, now he's a deadliner
here at your club.

07:34.224 --> 07:38.044
First ghost I've ever met that
didn't want my help, though.

07:38.045 --> 07:40.343
You're gonna figure out
something, though, right?

07:40.343 --> 07:42.571
- No. Yes. Not. I will.
- No? Okay.

07:42.571 --> 07:45.128
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, do you have a plan?

07:45.130 --> 07:48.152
Well, not totally. Uh, I have to go.

07:48.154 --> 07:51.178
I left my newsstand open. I
think I have a blob problem.

07:53.168 --> 07:54.333
I gotta go. I gotta go.

07:57.118 --> 07:59.416
Oh, no! No, no, no! Get out of here!

07:59.417 --> 08:01.904
Come on! Oh, look at this mess.

08:01.904 --> 08:06.023
Oh, man! Like... thank you very much!

08:06.024 --> 08:08.849
- Uh, Camomile White? Hi.
- Mm-hmm.

08:08.849 --> 08:10.511
To whom do I owe

08:10.511 --> 08:12.569
this extraordinary honor
and how much do I owe?

08:12.571 --> 08:15.932
Save the idiot routine for your customers.

08:15.934 --> 08:18.350
I know you were at the gallery
the day before the séance.

08:18.351 --> 08:21.276
And I know you turned
off the security cameras.

08:21.276 --> 08:22.907
And I'm assuming that's when you did

08:22.908 --> 08:24.470
whatever you did to the light bulbs.

08:24.470 --> 08:27.455
I don't presume to know
what any of that means.

08:27.455 --> 08:30.012
Let's stop skirting around
the issue, shall we?

08:30.022 --> 08:31.813
You tell me your trick
and I'll tell you mine.

08:31.814 --> 08:33.703
Why don't we start with this newsstand?

08:33.703 --> 08:35.763
- Oh, yeah. This old boy.
- Yeah.

08:35.763 --> 08:38.091
Me and Roofie... my friend. We thought,

08:38.091 --> 08:39.952
maybe it would help me drum
up a little more business.

08:39.952 --> 08:42.707
It's just a silly little
idea but with some hard work

08:42.707 --> 08:45.234
and a little luck, maybe I can
be the next Camomile White,

08:45.236 --> 08:46.727
except, you know, for real.

08:49.893 --> 08:52.080
Maybe we got off on the wrong foot.

08:52.082 --> 08:54.140
Maybe.

08:54.140 --> 08:56.070
Would you like to go out sometime?

08:56.072 --> 08:59.025
That's not what I thought
you were gonna say.

08:59.025 --> 09:01.055
You want to take my
number? Do you have a pen?

09:01.056 --> 09:03.981
Yes.

09:03.981 --> 09:05.672
Oh, I have this. Will this work?

09:05.672 --> 09:07.930
- Sure. Hand.
- Okay.

09:07.931 --> 09:10.060
Oh.

09:10.060 --> 09:11.284
Call me...

09:11.284 --> 09:13.980
when you want to...

09:13.981 --> 09:15.641
aah!

09:15.643 --> 09:18.030
Play. Okay.

09:18.030 --> 09:20.258
Yeah? Call me.

09:23.015 --> 09:25.810
Why are you even going
out with this woman, man?

09:25.810 --> 09:27.671
She caused you so much trouble.

09:27.671 --> 09:30.029
Yeah, I've been thinking about that.

09:30.030 --> 09:31.859
But if she's this incredibly mean to me

09:31.860 --> 09:33.214
and I still wanna have sex with her,

09:33.223 --> 09:35.780
that's gotta be true love, Roof.

09:35.780 --> 09:38.098
Even if I'm wrong and I hate her,

09:38.100 --> 09:39.660
I'm sure that I still
wanna have sex with her.

09:39.662 --> 09:42.158
Okay. But one problem.

09:42.158 --> 09:44.545
Camomile White is a woman
of expensive tastes.

09:44.547 --> 09:46.744
How'd you expect to pay for this?

09:46.746 --> 09:48.435
Ah, shart. I have to finish
this comedy club gig.

09:48.437 --> 09:50.466
What's the problem?

09:50.466 --> 09:53.420
It's this ghost comedian.
He just won't leave.

09:53.422 --> 09:54.913
Okay, so why don't you get a ghost heckler?

09:54.915 --> 09:57.540
No, Roofie. You don't understand

09:57.540 --> 09:59.431
the level of comedic genius
I'm dealing with here.

09:59.431 --> 10:01.659
This guy would destroy a heckler.

10:01.659 --> 10:04.017
Hmm.

10:04.018 --> 10:06.874
So, why don't you just find
the worst audience ever?

10:06.883 --> 10:10.397
Drunk, rowdy, uninhibited idiots

10:10.405 --> 10:12.624
who not only won't get his jokes,

10:12.625 --> 10:15.382
but they want all the
attention on themselves.

10:23.262 --> 10:25.648
Ladies, nonstop prog.
Real bachelorette party.

10:25.648 --> 10:27.379
Who wants to see a show?

10:27.381 --> 10:29.470
Did somebody say they
want to see a show? Huh?

10:30.772 --> 10:31.967
Hey, how are you doing out there?

10:31.967 --> 10:34.623
Whoo!

10:34.623 --> 10:37.319
What an attractive audience.
A battered women's shelter?

10:37.321 --> 10:39.836
We're a bachelorette party!

10:39.838 --> 10:42.495
Oh, bachelorette party, huh?

10:42.503 --> 10:44.622
Who's the bride-to-be, huh?

10:44.624 --> 10:47.418
Right here. Me. It's me.

10:47.419 --> 10:50.344
You? Wow! You landed a husband?

10:50.344 --> 10:52.234
What are you, rich?

10:53.667 --> 10:56.452
All right. Marriage is
a terrific institution.

10:56.454 --> 10:59.807
I myself, I only slept with
one woman for 25 years.

10:59.817 --> 11:01.508
And then my wife found out.

11:03.398 --> 11:05.328
Hey, hey. Heh-heh. All right!

11:05.329 --> 11:07.288
You know what? Obviously, this...

11:07.288 --> 11:09.577
this didn't work. Everyone out. Let's go.

11:09.577 --> 11:12.302
Hey! This is my bachelorette party,

11:12.304 --> 11:15.457
and we're not leaving until we see

11:15.457 --> 11:18.521
some hot damn man-flesh!

11:18.522 --> 11:20.014
Oh!

11:20.014 --> 11:22.203
Stripper! Stripper!

11:22.203 --> 11:24.232
Hey, hey, whoa, whoa. Ladies, ladies.

11:24.234 --> 11:25.994
Stripper! Stripper!

11:25.995 --> 11:29.117
You're worse than my in-laws
at Thanksgiving dinner.

11:29.119 --> 11:32.372
See me at Dangerfield's from now on.

11:32.372 --> 11:34.669
I don't need this.

11:34.671 --> 11:37.126
It actually worked. Huh!

11:37.128 --> 11:40.410
Stripper! Stripper!

11:40.412 --> 11:44.271
Oh! Come on, who threw that? Was that you?

11:44.273 --> 11:46.161
You're a troublemaker. I can see it.

11:46.163 --> 11:48.022
- What the hell happened in here?
- Huh? Oh.

11:48.024 --> 11:51.146
Uh, nothing. I had to bring in a few cats

11:51.148 --> 11:53.046
to get rid of the mouse.

11:53.048 --> 11:56.102
I don't know what you're talking
about, but you listen to me.

11:56.102 --> 12:00.021
Mr. Tim Allen is performing here tonight

12:00.023 --> 12:02.609
and he hates ghosts, okay?

12:02.609 --> 12:06.499
If you don't fix this, you
are so not getting paid!

12:06.501 --> 12:08.260
- Oh, no, no.
- Oh, no.

12:08.260 --> 12:10.321
I need you to pay me because
I need the money for my date.

12:10.321 --> 12:12.180
For my probably soulmate Camomile.

12:12.181 --> 12:13.912
I don't care about your date!

12:13.912 --> 12:16.041
The only thing I care about
right now is Tim Allen.

12:16.043 --> 12:19.424
You fix whatever ghost
stuff is happening here.

12:19.424 --> 12:21.354
- Yes.
- Fix it!

12:21.356 --> 12:23.244
Okay.

12:23.246 --> 12:26.370
Stripper! Stripper! Stripper!

12:30.488 --> 12:33.483
All right, ladies, you don't
have to go into the light,

12:33.483 --> 12:35.911
but you can't stay here!

12:35.911 --> 12:38.368
Ain't that right, officer Billy Club?

12:44.718 --> 12:46.934
Get this music on for you.

12:49.960 --> 12:52.160
All right!

12:55.084 --> 12:57.143
Whoo-hoo!

12:58.638 --> 13:01.163
Yeah, he's got a gun, look out!

13:01.163 --> 13:02.925
Check out his gun, ladies!

13:06.775 --> 13:08.904
Nice, right?

13:08.904 --> 13:10.994
Whoa! Ha-ha!

13:10.994 --> 13:13.322
- Show that junk!
- Show that junk!

13:13.322 --> 13:16.217
Oh, they, uh, want you to show them

13:16.217 --> 13:18.236
your, uh, member.

13:19.800 --> 13:23.780
They? I mean me. I call me "they."

13:24.019 --> 13:27.182
Oh, come on, buddy,
this isn't my first time

13:27.182 --> 13:30.734
dancing for a bachelorette fetishist.

13:30.735 --> 13:33.928
No, I'm telling you there's
a bachelorette party

13:33.928 --> 13:36.445
going on right behind
you. Right behind you.

13:36.445 --> 13:38.605
- Whoa!
- You're a little weirdo, huh?

13:38.616 --> 13:40.566
I know. Yeah.

13:40.574 --> 13:44.556
- There's girls right there.
- How come I can't see them?

13:44.795 --> 13:46.554
Because they're all dead. They're all dead.

13:48.645 --> 13:51.468
You sick prick!

13:51.470 --> 13:53.658
Oh! Whoa, don't shoot! Don't shoot!

13:53.659 --> 13:57.618
- Wait. Is that a prop gun?
- Uh...

13:57.620 --> 14:00.842
It's just... it's just girls!
Officer Billy Club, come on!

14:00.844 --> 14:03.361
Hey, where did the man-flesh go?

14:03.369 --> 14:05.926
What kind of bachelorette party is this?

14:05.928 --> 14:09.050
I don't know. Can't we just
drink some cosmopolitans

14:09.052 --> 14:11.071
and play a game of pin
the dick on the donkey?

14:11.071 --> 14:14.434
No! We got on that bus,
and we had a vision.

14:14.434 --> 14:17.289
And that vision was of a
big, throbbing phallus.

14:17.289 --> 14:19.509
And we are not going anywhere
until we see some male dick!

14:19.518 --> 14:22.733
Okay, fine. You guys want to
see a dick and you'll leave?

14:22.742 --> 14:24.731
Yeah! Please.

14:24.733 --> 14:26.761
I said, you guys wanna see
some dick and you'll leave?

14:28.821 --> 14:30.811
All right, I'm gonna go
find the first guy I see,

14:30.812 --> 14:32.672
bring him in here and
make you show his dick.

14:42.543 --> 14:44.531
Whoa.

14:44.533 --> 14:47.497
Oh, it's so effing bright.

14:49.219 --> 14:51.915
Oh, Sujita, do you think
they have brunch there?

14:51.915 --> 14:53.735
Do you think we need to make reservations?

14:53.736 --> 14:57.197
Let's order two things so
we can have more variety.

14:58.721 --> 15:00.551
Ah!

15:08.234 --> 15:09.854
You really wanna make this place look nice?

15:09.854 --> 15:12.012
- Throw on some pants.
- Oh, no!

15:12.014 --> 15:14.012
Are you kidding me?
What are you doing here?

15:14.014 --> 15:15.366
What happened to Dangerfield's?

15:15.377 --> 15:16.600
Nah, Kinison went long.

15:16.600 --> 15:18.131
I got bumped. The jerk.

15:18.133 --> 15:19.356
Oh.

15:19.356 --> 15:21.018
Come on, I'm begging you.

15:21.018 --> 15:23.176
Buddy, you gotta...
just go into your light.

15:23.178 --> 15:25.803
It's not my fault that
your wife sucked so hard.

15:25.803 --> 15:27.565
Hey, listen! My wife was a lot of things.

15:27.565 --> 15:30.022
But she did not suck.

15:30.023 --> 15:32.549
Sadly not even on my birthday.
But that's none your business.

15:32.549 --> 15:34.807
I ought to knock your block off.

15:34.809 --> 15:36.369
What are you talking about?

15:36.371 --> 15:38.897
Your whole act is about
how horrible your wife was.

15:38.898 --> 15:40.421
The act, it's jokes.

15:40.429 --> 15:42.787
I wrote most of those things
before I even met her.

15:42.789 --> 15:44.449
The truth is my wife was nothing like that.

15:44.450 --> 15:46.339
My wife was...

15:46.340 --> 15:48.270
she was, uh...

15:48.270 --> 15:52.418
I can't remember. Wow!

15:52.420 --> 15:55.741
I guess I've been doing
the "my wife" bit so long

15:55.743 --> 15:58.032
I forgot what she was really like.

15:58.042 --> 15:59.762
I think I really loved her.

15:59.762 --> 16:01.692
If you really loved your wife,

16:01.693 --> 16:04.049
why can't you figure out a way to do

16:04.051 --> 16:06.140
- some nice material about her?
- Hold on.

16:09.065 --> 16:11.890
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
When I started dating my wife,

16:11.892 --> 16:13.722
I was so poor...

16:13.722 --> 16:16.110
Come on, help a specter out.

16:16.110 --> 16:18.607
- How poor were you?
- Thank you.

16:18.608 --> 16:22.586
I was so poor that I couldn't
even afford to buy her flowers.

16:22.588 --> 16:25.581
So I stopped on the way
to her house one day,

16:25.583 --> 16:28.169
at the empty lot, and I picked
up a bunch of dandelions.

16:28.179 --> 16:29.899
Oh, she's no dummy.

16:29.901 --> 16:31.960
She knew they were weeds

16:31.960 --> 16:35.015
but she put 'em on a vase
full of water, just the same.

16:35.025 --> 16:37.175
Just like they were a dozen roses.

16:37.183 --> 16:39.900
She didn't want to hurt my feelings.

16:39.900 --> 16:44.486
The point is I knew right at that moment

16:44.488 --> 16:45.722
she was the one.

16:50.069 --> 16:53.731
Well, what do you know. There's my light.

16:55.452 --> 16:57.511
Thanks, Kevin.

16:57.511 --> 16:59.571
Good luck.

17:08.517 --> 17:10.575
Wasn't very funny.

17:14.247 --> 17:15.568
All right, try it now.

17:15.569 --> 17:17.101
Testes. Testes. One, two, three.

17:17.103 --> 17:20.057
- Yes, good?
- Yeah, we're good.

17:20.057 --> 17:22.146
I'm just not sure why
you're still doing this.

17:22.146 --> 17:25.210
I mean, you met him.
Doesn't he seem harmless

17:25.212 --> 17:27.369
and a little sweet, in
a simple kind of way?

17:27.369 --> 17:29.260
He's not harmless, Sue.

17:29.262 --> 17:31.617
He's probably the greatest
con artist of all time.

17:31.619 --> 17:33.717
I tried to reason with him medium to medium

17:33.719 --> 17:35.539
and he basically threatened me,

17:35.539 --> 17:38.035
saying he intended to become
the next Camomile White.

17:38.037 --> 17:39.400
Well, not on my watch.

17:39.400 --> 17:40.962
So you're just taking out

17:40.962 --> 17:42.623
a little insurance policy?

17:42.623 --> 17:46.046
All I need to do is get
him to say the magic words.

17:46.046 --> 17:49.199
You look really pretty tonight.

17:51.330 --> 17:53.417
Of course.

17:53.419 --> 17:54.852
Hi!

17:57.438 --> 17:59.567
Thank you.

18:01.499 --> 18:04.054
Oh, I got these for you.

18:04.055 --> 18:06.413
I picked them, actually.
They're beautiful dandelions.

18:06.413 --> 18:08.403
I know they're not actually flowers

18:08.403 --> 18:10.195
- but a friend of mine told me...
- Thank you. They're lovely.

18:10.204 --> 18:12.264
- They mean more than...
- I'll put them in some water.

18:12.264 --> 18:14.382
- Thank you.
- Okay, great. Yeah.

18:14.382 --> 18:16.941
Wowee!

18:16.950 --> 18:19.367
So many nice things. Uh...

18:19.369 --> 18:21.367
so I was thinking that tonight,

18:21.367 --> 18:23.785
maybe we could just go to
the Big Apple Comedy Club.

18:23.785 --> 18:26.948
Two drink minimum but I happen
to know the owner, so...

18:26.950 --> 18:31.694
You know, I was thinking
that we could just stay in.

18:31.696 --> 18:33.854
I mean, you're clearly into me,

18:33.854 --> 18:37.913
and I'm clearly into you.

18:37.915 --> 18:39.336
Phew.

18:39.337 --> 18:42.094
So let's stop dancing around our feelings

18:42.104 --> 18:43.824
- and let's just (Bleep)
- Oh!

18:45.228 --> 18:48.042
- Whoa! Oh, just a heads up.
- Yeah.

18:48.044 --> 18:49.336
There's no button on these pants.

18:49.347 --> 18:50.938
So you don't have to do anything.

18:50.939 --> 18:52.300
There's an elastic all the way around.

18:52.302 --> 18:53.862
- Perfect.
- It is, right?

18:53.864 --> 18:55.783
I just need to know something first.

18:55.785 --> 18:58.350
Are you seeing any other women?

18:58.352 --> 18:59.912
Yeah, I'm seeing some girls.

18:59.914 --> 19:02.002
I'm kidding. I don't know why I said that.

19:02.004 --> 19:03.931
Nope. I was being hard to get.

19:03.933 --> 19:07.057
Well, good. Because I
don't want to share you.

19:07.057 --> 19:10.678
Good. Trust me, I am not seeing
any other women right now.

19:10.679 --> 19:13.595
Well, are you seeing any ghosts right now?

19:13.604 --> 19:16.518
- No.
- What about recently?

19:16.520 --> 19:18.549
- You seen any ghost recently?
- Uh, no.

19:18.549 --> 19:20.080
I have never seen a ghost.

19:20.082 --> 19:22.001
I don't even know how that would work

19:22.003 --> 19:23.962
if I'm being totally honest.

19:23.962 --> 19:26.986
Very good, Mr. Packalockloogie.

19:26.988 --> 19:29.046
Oh. Uh, close. Mr. Pacalioglu.

19:29.046 --> 19:31.514
At least I think it is.
I've never met my parents.

19:31.514 --> 19:33.801
- I'm an orphan.
- Right.

19:33.802 --> 19:35.761
What happened? Are you okay?

19:35.763 --> 19:37.822
Is my boner too big?

19:37.822 --> 19:40.079
- No.
- Okay.

19:40.081 --> 19:41.872
I've suddenly got a splitting
headache. You better go.

19:41.882 --> 19:43.841
Well, you can take something for that.

19:43.842 --> 19:45.532
I got pills. I could give you one of those.

19:45.533 --> 19:47.155
I'm sure one would be good for headache.

19:47.166 --> 19:50.678
This headache won't go away
for as long as you're here.

19:50.686 --> 19:53.572
- Oh, it's one of those.
- Yeah, you better go.

19:53.573 --> 19:54.905
I've been around a few of those.

19:54.907 --> 19:56.596
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

19:56.597 --> 19:58.427
- Okay, but, Ms. White?
- Yeah?

19:58.427 --> 20:00.914
I would just like to say
that I had the time...

20:00.916 --> 20:02.606
- Me too.
- No, uh...

20:05.404 --> 20:07.591
Oh, my God. How did it go? It sounded good.

20:07.591 --> 20:11.353
Perfect. We've got lots of work to do.

20:13.712 --> 20:15.531
What about recently?

20:15.542 --> 20:16.934
Have you seen any ghosts recently?

20:16.935 --> 20:19.291
No. I have never seen a ghost.

20:19.293 --> 20:20.884
I don't even know how that would work

20:20.886 --> 20:23.611
- if I'm being totally honest.
- Got him.

20:34.367 --> 20:37.182
Seriously, what the heck
are you supposed to be?

20:37.192 --> 20:39.440
- I don't know.
- Women, huh?

20:39.442 --> 20:42.763
- Yeah.
- Love is hard.

20:44.725 --> 20:47.251
So what, you need a place to stay, buddy?

20:47.251 --> 20:48.446
Yeah.

20:48.446 --> 20:51.659
Yeah, that's what I thought.

20:53.123 --> 20:55.111
Okay, buddy, come on home with me.

20:57.171 --> 20:59.431
More chips, please.
