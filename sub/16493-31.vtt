WEBVTT

00:01.289 --> 00:04.706
Maybe, this is the year
I finally finish this race.

00:04.789 --> 00:05.956
You've run it before?

00:06.040 --> 00:08.331
No, he runs it every year,
but just the beginning of it.

00:08.414 --> 00:09.956
I've never crossed the finish line,

00:10.040 --> 00:11.497
what with Murphy's Law and all.

00:11.581 --> 00:13.789
I just can't carry everything
I need to combat it,

00:13.873 --> 00:14.998
while I'm running.

00:15.081 --> 00:17.247
That's why you guys
are carrying my backpack.

00:17.331 --> 00:19.831
No problem. So, what have
we got to work with?

00:19.915 --> 00:21.081
Let's see.

00:21.165 --> 00:25.040
Bandages, electrolyte snacks,
a bottle of sun block, as big as my head.

00:25.123 --> 00:27.623
Also, dissolvable sleeping bags.

00:27.706 --> 00:31.873
A metal detector. And a stuffed elephant?

00:31.956 --> 00:34.165
Those things may
or may not make sense later.

00:34.247 --> 00:36.331
-When?
-Well, I don't know.

00:36.414 --> 00:39.206
It's just that,
anything that can go wrong...

00:39.289 --> 00:40.497
[both] Will go wrong!

00:40.581 --> 00:41.581
But not today.

00:41.664 --> 00:45.331
We'll get ahead on our bikes, scope out
any situations and be ready for you.

00:45.414 --> 00:47.289
-With a stuffed elephant.
-[toy squeaks]

00:47.372 --> 00:48.789
You guys'll have the backpack,

00:48.873 --> 00:51.247
and I'll have my motivational
mantras like this one...

00:51.331 --> 00:53.497
Don't stop swimming or you'll die.

00:53.581 --> 00:55.581
Or maybe, that's just sharks.

00:55.664 --> 00:56.956
Did you read that in this book?

00:57.040 --> 00:59.081
Inspirational Shark Mantras?

00:59.165 --> 01:01.539
Yeah, sharks are surprisingly
positive thinkers.

01:01.623 --> 01:02.706
[announcer] Ready!

01:02.789 --> 01:05.539
-Set. Go, runners!
-[bell rings]

01:05.623 --> 01:07.456
Oops! Gotta go. You know what they say,

01:07.539 --> 01:10.539
"If everyone's running,
they're probably running from you."

01:10.623 --> 01:13.414
-Another shark mantra?
-Or maybe, a Milo mantra.

01:14.289 --> 01:15.915
Whoops! Sorry!

01:18.165 --> 01:20.664
It's gonna be a long race.

01:23.497 --> 01:26.497
Can't believe we're stuck
with Cavendish and Dakota's nut mission.

01:26.581 --> 01:28.123
We can check it off in a couple hours

01:28.206 --> 01:30.040
and then get back to saving the world.

01:30.123 --> 01:33.789
So, how does selling pistachios keep them
from becoming extinct in the future?

01:33.873 --> 01:36.748
We just stand here and make sure
nothing happens to the shipment.

01:36.831 --> 01:38.539
So, we're nut guards.

01:38.623 --> 01:39.998
Seed sentries.

01:40.081 --> 01:41.748
Legume lookouts.

01:41.831 --> 01:44.331
-They're not legumes.
-[mocking] "They're not legumes!"

01:44.414 --> 01:45.831
That's what you sound like.

01:48.040 --> 01:49.497
Race for Runts.

01:49.581 --> 01:52.664
So, they're raising money for dogs
that are smaller than other dogs?

01:52.748 --> 01:55.331
I guess, they gotta buy them
more food so they can grow.

01:55.414 --> 01:56.456
Yes.

01:56.539 --> 02:00.123
Well, we can't let pistachio survive
and take over the world.

02:00.206 --> 02:01.789
So, we have to stop Brick and Savannah.

02:01.873 --> 02:03.497
This is not going to be easy.

02:03.581 --> 02:06.539
Yeah, but it's better than cleaning
outhouses in the Renaissance.

02:06.623 --> 02:08.456
All you ever hear about are the paintings,

02:08.539 --> 02:10.123
they don't tell you about the stench.

02:10.873 --> 02:12.915
Oh, hi. Hey, Cavendish, Dakota!

02:12.998 --> 02:14.040
-Oh, hello, Murphy.
-Hey, Murphy.

02:15.873 --> 02:16.789
Uh-oh!

02:16.873 --> 02:18.706
[screams] Murphy's Law!

02:18.789 --> 02:21.873
-[Cavendish screams]
-Where are we going? When are we going?

02:23.664 --> 02:24.664
[both grunt]

02:25.331 --> 02:26.206
Hmm.

02:26.289 --> 02:29.539
Looks like we've traveled to the 1870s.

02:29.623 --> 02:31.623
-Hey, you're finally in style.
-[grunts]

02:31.706 --> 02:33.123
OK, let's pull a u-ey and go back.

02:33.206 --> 02:34.372
Howdy, there, partners.

02:34.456 --> 02:36.206
Oh, [clears throat] hello, um...

02:36.289 --> 02:38.206
We're just passing through, don't mind us.

02:38.289 --> 02:40.414
Oh, I don't mind nothing.

02:40.497 --> 02:44.123
If I spent time minding things,
I'd be minding all the time.

02:45.456 --> 02:46.372
[neighs]

02:47.206 --> 02:48.081
[engine whirring]

02:48.165 --> 02:51.123
Uh, won't. Now it won't start.

02:51.206 --> 02:52.165
We're stuck!

02:52.331 --> 02:53.206
We're stuck!

02:53.289 --> 02:55.539
The future is doomed
and the Renaissance potties

02:55.623 --> 02:57.456
are going to have to clean themselves.

02:57.539 --> 02:58.873
Well, if we're gonna be
stuck here for a bit,

02:58.956 --> 03:01.623
maybe we should get some new outfits
so we can blend in.

03:01.706 --> 03:03.915
Uh. Well, I guess, just me.

03:03.998 --> 03:05.081
[all cheering]

03:05.165 --> 03:06.456
[both] Go, Milo!

03:06.539 --> 03:08.581
-How are you feeling?
-Great!

03:08.664 --> 03:10.165
Just a little thirsty.

03:12.748 --> 03:13.748
[eagle screaming]

03:16.081 --> 03:17.497
Throw me my towel.

03:17.581 --> 03:19.165
OK, heads up, Milo.

03:20.873 --> 03:22.123
[gasps]

03:22.539 --> 03:24.915
No, not a trowel. A towel!

03:24.998 --> 03:28.123
Oh, sorry, that makes much more sense.

03:30.331 --> 03:31.497
Milo, bridge ahead!

03:31.581 --> 03:32.664
[bird chirps]

03:32.748 --> 03:35.831
Get the discus and the bandage ready.

03:39.789 --> 03:40.748
Watch out!

03:41.915 --> 03:43.915
The discus, throw it at the lever.

03:48.165 --> 03:48.998
[grunts]

03:52.956 --> 03:55.915
Amazing, Milo. What were you
gonna do with the bandage?

03:55.998 --> 03:58.331
Oh, yeah, I've got a blister. Thanks.

03:58.748 --> 03:59.623
[both] Oh!

04:01.414 --> 04:04.289
So, how soon before I can
start saying, "Reckon?"

04:04.372 --> 04:05.456
Preferably, never.

04:05.539 --> 04:08.456
We just have to fix our time machine
and get back to the future to stop

04:08.539 --> 04:10.998
Brick and Savannah
from saving those pistachios.

04:11.081 --> 04:12.706
I reckon I need more thread.

04:12.789 --> 04:14.372
See, it sounds so cool when he says it.

04:14.456 --> 04:18.456
How are we gonna find parts for a car
built 150 years in the future?

04:18.539 --> 04:20.998
Did I hear 150 years in the future?

04:21.081 --> 04:23.497
Oh, hello, Sherriff. Murphy, is it?

04:23.581 --> 04:24.873
Oh, funny, as in Murphy's law.

04:24.956 --> 04:28.040
Well, I am a Murphy and I am the law.

04:28.123 --> 04:29.414
I reckon, you are.

04:29.539 --> 04:32.165
Hear that? I said, "Reckon."
Reckon you are.

04:35.123 --> 04:36.664
[screams]

04:37.247 --> 04:38.497
[screams]

04:38.581 --> 04:40.873
Whoa! Look at that.
Good thing it's not Sunday.

04:40.956 --> 04:41.998
New clothes, eh?

04:42.123 --> 04:45.206
Phillip here, is the best tailor
in these here parts.

04:45.289 --> 04:46.497
Of course, he is the only one.

04:46.623 --> 04:49.915
If y'all are from the future,
I reckon that means you're time travelers.

04:50.831 --> 04:52.331
[both mumbling]

04:52.414 --> 04:53.789
We get a lot of those down here.

04:53.873 --> 04:55.956
-[together] You do?
-They hang out at the So So Corral.

04:56.040 --> 04:57.873
Best saloon in these here parts.

04:57.956 --> 04:59.497
Of course, it's also the only one.

05:01.206 --> 05:03.748
Place is just down the street.
This street, that is.

05:03.831 --> 05:05.206
The only street.

05:05.331 --> 05:06.539
If there are time travelers here,

05:06.623 --> 05:08.539
they may have the parts we need.

05:08.623 --> 05:10.831
I wonder if they have cold pressed juice.

05:10.956 --> 05:12.956
It's 1875!

05:13.040 --> 05:15.539
What? You think juice is new?
They had fruit in the past.

05:16.165 --> 05:19.414
Hang on, are we sure, that this is the...

05:19.998 --> 05:21.206
What's that now?

05:21.289 --> 05:24.915
I said, are we sure that
this is the right overpass?

05:24.998 --> 05:27.623
Oh. No.

05:27.748 --> 05:29.456
We've got an overpass demo, up ahead.

05:29.581 --> 05:30.915
What do you think, you'll need?

05:30.998 --> 05:32.998
I don't know, use your instincts.

05:33.123 --> 05:35.040
I'm thinking, "Inflatable Santa."

05:35.123 --> 05:37.456
-What would he do with that?
-What does he ever do with it?

05:37.581 --> 05:38.998
You can do it, guys!

05:39.081 --> 05:42.956
The only thing we have to fear is harpoons
and feeding frenzies.

05:43.123 --> 05:44.581
Enough with the shark mantras.

05:44.664 --> 05:47.081
Too obvious, too weird, too egg beater-y.

05:48.915 --> 05:51.664
I have no more instincts.
I'm running on fumes, here.

05:51.748 --> 05:53.456
Both good mantras.

05:53.539 --> 05:56.289
What if we can't get you
to the finish line? Wait, Milo.

05:56.414 --> 05:59.247
Come on, guys.
It's time to go full Megalodon.

05:59.372 --> 06:01.915
Nothing can break your bones
when you're cartilaginous.

06:02.040 --> 06:04.873
That's not a seal, that's a surfer.

06:06.539 --> 06:08.581
You really gotta get another mantra book.

06:10.623 --> 06:13.414
And that's when we realized,
we were stuck here.

06:13.497 --> 06:15.748
And that's how it happened to us, too.

06:15.831 --> 06:19.247
Hang on, all of you are time travelers
who got stuck here?

06:19.331 --> 06:21.165
[indistinct blabbering]

06:21.289 --> 06:23.165
The only person I know personally,

06:23.247 --> 06:25.956
who's really from here
is Sherriff Murphy, personally.

06:26.081 --> 06:29.497
Sherriff Murphy, that's it! He's a Murphy,

06:29.581 --> 06:31.789
and he's the law. He is...

06:31.915 --> 06:33.789
The original Murphy's Law!

06:33.873 --> 06:36.040
You're a real conclusion stealer,
you know that?

06:36.165 --> 06:39.706
That man is Milo's great, great,
great, great grandfather!

06:39.831 --> 06:43.998
That's why this place is like
a time travel Bermuda Triangle, so...

06:44.123 --> 06:46.539
So, all of you are stranded
here like us, huh?

06:46.623 --> 06:48.414
So, what happened to your time machines?

06:49.539 --> 06:51.915
[Dakota] Wow.
These are some snazzy vehicles.

06:51.998 --> 06:54.456
How come, we always get stuck
with the outdated lemon?

06:54.539 --> 06:56.539
Well, because the last time
they gave us a new car,

06:56.623 --> 06:58.165
we destroyed Earth's second moon.

06:58.247 --> 06:59.623
-I, uh...
-You're sure

06:59.706 --> 07:01.706
that you can't get any of them working?

07:01.789 --> 07:03.831
Personally, I stopped looking for the gas.

07:03.915 --> 07:05.123
I like it here, personally.

07:05.206 --> 07:06.998
Oh, yeah. Me, too.

07:07.165 --> 07:08.623
Our machine needed batteries.

07:08.706 --> 07:09.831
Diesel fuel.

07:09.956 --> 07:11.623
Mine takes gingerbread lattes.

07:11.706 --> 07:14.998
Your time machine uses
gingerbread lattes for power?

07:15.123 --> 07:16.331
Well, not exclusively.

07:16.414 --> 07:18.247
All the holiday flavors are used.

07:18.372 --> 07:19.915
[Christmas bells jingling]

07:20.040 --> 07:21.456
Uh. What are we going to do?

07:21.539 --> 07:24.165
We're gonna be stuck here
like these people for all eternity.

07:24.247 --> 07:27.040
Chewing straw and saying, "Reckon" a lot.

07:27.123 --> 07:28.831
Ooh! That does feel good.

07:28.915 --> 07:30.497
-Eh, reckon.
-Reckon.

07:30.581 --> 07:31.581
[dramatically] Reckon.

07:31.664 --> 07:33.247
[together] Yes.

07:33.372 --> 07:36.623
But if we don't get back, the future
will be ruined by those plants.

07:36.706 --> 07:38.247
Well, I suppose there is the possibility

07:38.331 --> 07:41.956
that Brick and Savannah will fail
the mission just like we always did.

07:43.206 --> 07:45.748
-Ooh, never mind. No!
-Yeah, that's not going to happen.

07:46.581 --> 07:48.372
[horse neighing]

07:48.456 --> 07:50.623
[engine sputtering]

07:50.706 --> 07:51.873
Every moment we're stuck here,

07:51.956 --> 07:54.664
we come closer to a pistachio
dominated future.

07:54.789 --> 07:56.706
Maybe, we can find
a working starter switch

07:56.789 --> 07:59.165
in one of those abandoned machines
and jerry-rig it?

07:59.289 --> 08:01.497
Capital idea. Let's push.

08:02.581 --> 08:05.165
[banjo playing]

08:05.831 --> 08:09.247
Eh, let me give you a hand getting that
to the time machine junk yard.

08:09.372 --> 08:10.372
Ah. Why, thank you.

08:10.456 --> 08:11.873
Oh. Wait. No.

08:11.956 --> 08:13.664
Don't help. Murphy's law.

08:15.289 --> 08:16.331
[donkey braying]

08:16.414 --> 08:17.623
Ah!

08:18.123 --> 08:19.331
[screaming]

08:19.414 --> 08:21.831
Hey, hey,
if we get them running fast enough,

08:21.956 --> 08:23.998
our old, crummy, standard transmission

08:24.081 --> 08:25.289
will let us bump start.

08:25.372 --> 08:27.414
We just pop the clutch
and it should start.

08:27.497 --> 08:28.623
Oh! You're right.

08:29.581 --> 08:30.831
Whoa!

08:30.956 --> 08:32.081
Pop it!

08:33.040 --> 08:34.081
[engine starts]

08:34.206 --> 08:35.081
[both] Yes!

08:36.539 --> 08:37.956
Why did they...

08:38.040 --> 08:39.998
[screaming]

08:42.040 --> 08:44.331
Since we're going to die anyway,
I'd like to air some grievances.

08:45.539 --> 08:47.414
Yes! Ye-hess!

08:47.539 --> 08:49.165
Well, safe travels, now.

08:49.247 --> 08:52.998
Oh, say hello to my great, great,
great, great grandkids.

08:53.123 --> 08:54.289
[dramatic music playing]

08:54.372 --> 08:55.497
[Zack] Uh-oh.

08:55.581 --> 08:57.289
Lot of possible hazards, here.

08:57.372 --> 08:58.206
Dig deep.

08:58.289 --> 09:00.748
Rubber cement glue,
fistful of pebbles and a nail scissor.

09:00.873 --> 09:02.998
Badminton racket,
tin foil ball, picture frame.

09:03.123 --> 09:04.915
Bacon bits, stapler, paint thinner.

09:04.998 --> 09:06.706
I don't know. I just don't know.

09:06.831 --> 09:08.040
He's almost here.

09:08.123 --> 09:09.706
Game over, man!

09:09.789 --> 09:11.331
We're finished.

09:11.372 --> 09:13.040
-[bell dings]
-Finished.

09:13.123 --> 09:14.289
[both] I have an idea.

09:14.414 --> 09:16.956
Well, nuts are still safe.

09:17.040 --> 09:18.456
Yep. Still safe.

09:19.998 --> 09:20.956
[Dakota] Look out!

09:21.040 --> 09:22.081
The steering is gone.

09:22.206 --> 09:23.497
[Dakota] Well, we are in mid-air.

09:28.831 --> 09:31.456
[Milo panting] I have to...

09:31.581 --> 09:32.664
[gasping] Finish.

09:32.748 --> 09:33.789
Just a little...

09:33.915 --> 09:35.372
[panting] Further...

09:35.497 --> 09:37.456
We destroyed the pistachios.

09:37.539 --> 09:39.497
Mission accomplished.

09:39.623 --> 09:41.831
[panting]

09:41.956 --> 09:43.289
[gasp] So...

09:43.372 --> 09:44.289
So close.

09:44.372 --> 09:46.289
Milo! Over here.

09:46.789 --> 09:47.956
[panting]

09:48.040 --> 09:50.165
You guys have a backup finish line!

09:50.247 --> 09:52.040
[laughing] Ha-ha! Brilliant.

09:52.123 --> 09:53.289
Milo, one-oh-one.

09:53.372 --> 09:54.873
Always have a backup.

09:54.956 --> 09:56.664
[dramatic victory music]

09:56.789 --> 10:00.539
-Yes, yes, we did it. We did it.
-We did it!

10:02.915 --> 10:04.915
-And also you.
-You too, Milo. You finished.

10:05.040 --> 10:06.998
-You finished!
-Yes!

10:07.081 --> 10:08.206
That's right.

10:08.956 --> 10:10.706
But you guys built this pretty fast

10:10.789 --> 10:13.539
and we should probably
get out from under here.

10:18.706 --> 10:20.372
Aw, nuts.

10:20.456 --> 10:23.372
[mockingly] "Aw, nuts."
