THE MANDALORIAN: The kid's coming with me.

26:12.072 --> 26:15.826

then you'll put it on the speeder

26:16.285 --> 26:18.370

26:20.789 --> 26:22.666

THE MANDALORIAN: Here's what I'll do.

28:18.448 --> 28:22.494
I'm gonna walk to my ship with the kid
and you're gonna let it happen.

28:23.787 --> 28:26.290
No. How about this?

28:27.207 --> 28:29.459
We take the kid,

28:29.543 --> 28:34.631
and if you try to stop us, we kill you
and we strip your body for parts.

We'll hold them off!

30:12.729 --> 30:15.065
THE MANDALORIAN: You're going
to have to relocate the covert.

30:15.566 --> 30:17.192
