WEBVTT

00:26.333 --> 00:27.625
(Barker)
'Step right up!'

00:27.709 --> 00:29.917
Step right up, boys
and girls of all ages

00:30.000 --> 00:33.250
for the final act of our
big top extravaganza!

00:38.083 --> 00:39.625
(male #1)
'Let's hear it
one more time'

00:39.709 --> 00:42.333
'for Zelda,
Queen of knives!'

00:42.417 --> 00:46.208
And now, city
of brotherly love

00:46.291 --> 00:49.125
birthplace of
The American Circus.

00:49.208 --> 00:51.041
Let me introduce to you

00:51.125 --> 00:54.625
our headliner,
the human butterfly

00:54.709 --> 00:58.959
Mia Romanov and her
magical metamorphosis!

01:59.375 --> 02:01.166
Well, boss,
you wanted to see me?

02:01.250 --> 02:03.125
Sit down.

02:10.417 --> 02:13.166
- Moe Kitchener.
- What about him?

02:13.250 --> 02:15.875
He got shot last night
outside
a bar over in Roxborough.

02:18.417 --> 02:20.041
- You're serious?
- Large caliber slug.

02:20.125 --> 02:21.875
Back of the head.

02:23.208 --> 02:26.041
So...he's dead?

02:26.125 --> 02:27.792
Where were you last night, Lil?

02:27.875 --> 02:30.625
Home. I was, uh,
finishing up a report.

02:30.709 --> 02:34.208
You're going to need
someone to confirm that.

02:34.291 --> 02:37.041
Who-who's the
investigating detective?

02:37.125 --> 02:39.959
Doherty wants the state
police to handle it.

02:43.750 --> 02:46.166
They're gonna want
to talk to you.

03:00.667 --> 03:03.834
- You alright?
- I don't know.

03:03.917 --> 03:05.333
Listen, I told the boss

03:05.417 --> 03:07.000
if anyone wants to know,
you were home when

03:07.083 --> 03:08.083
I dropped off that
file last night.

03:08.166 --> 03:09.417
- The file?
- Yeah.

03:09.500 --> 03:12.125
Rodriguez file, '06.

03:12.208 --> 03:14.709
(Valens)
'No way you could've been
across
town when Moe caught one'

03:14.792 --> 03:16.583
outside that bar.

03:16.667 --> 03:19.417
Yeah.

03:19.500 --> 03:21.792
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

03:21.875 --> 03:24.959
(Valens)
Listen, I got a lady
waiting on a case.

03:25.041 --> 03:26.291
I'll handle it.

03:26.375 --> 03:27.959
I want to..

03:28.041 --> 03:29.875
...keep working.

03:35.291 --> 03:37.500
(Valens)
Detectives Valens. Rush.

03:37.583 --> 03:40.792
You got something on an old
homicide, Miss Deluca?

03:40.875 --> 03:42.083
Mia Romanov.

03:42.166 --> 03:44.125
An aerialist for
the Jones brothers circus.

03:44.208 --> 03:45.291
The circus?

03:45.375 --> 03:47.417
Her death was ruled
an accidental fall

03:47.500 --> 03:49.083
in 1971.

03:49.166 --> 03:51.208
- You're saying it wasn't?
- Mia did a silk act.

03:51.291 --> 03:54.166
Where she came out of a cocoon
high above the rafters.

03:54.250 --> 03:57.166
I knew something was wrong
the moment she came out.

03:59.583 --> 04:02.625
- This a bad time?
- What?

04:02.709 --> 04:05.667
No. Uh, you were there
the night of her fall?

04:05.750 --> 04:08.250
My mother worked
at Jones brothers circus.

04:08.333 --> 04:10.417
She was a fortune-teller.

04:10.500 --> 04:11.667
I'm a psychic.

04:11.750 --> 04:13.834
Always felt Mia's "accident"
was anything but..

04:13.917 --> 04:15.333
(Valens)
'Then just tell us'

04:15.417 --> 04:16.625
who you "feel" killed her

04:16.709 --> 04:18.542
and we'll clear
this
up by lunchtime.

04:19.583 --> 04:21.000
Doesn't work that way.

04:21.083 --> 04:23.500
Yeah, it never does.

04:23.583 --> 04:25.417
Always wondered how
Mia could've fallen.

04:25.500 --> 04:27.500
And then I found these
at an exhibit

04:27.583 --> 04:28.875
"Death under the big top."

04:28.959 --> 04:30.083
Photographs of various

04:30.166 --> 04:32.250
tragic falls,
including Mia's.

04:32.333 --> 04:35.250
You can see how the other
performers braced for impact.

04:35.333 --> 04:37.041
- Mia didn't.
- Fell head first.

04:37.125 --> 04:39.166
Arms limp, hands at her side.

04:39.250 --> 04:40.500
Might've been unconscious.

04:40.583 --> 04:41.959
Or already dead.

04:42.041 --> 04:44.750
You think that her fall
was some kind of
cover-up?

04:44.834 --> 04:46.583
Mia grew up in the circus.

04:46.667 --> 04:48.083
Had the agility
of a cat.

04:48.166 --> 04:50.458
Something wasn't
right. I felt it.

04:50.542 --> 04:52.500
Yeah, we got that.

04:52.583 --> 04:55.667
We'll be in touch, Isabel.

04:55.750 --> 04:56.917
Your mother..

04:57.000 --> 04:58.875
...will be fine.

05:00.750 --> 05:03.792
You, I'm not so sure.

05:42.542 --> 05:43.875
(Vera)
'Mia Romanov, 18.'

05:43.959 --> 05:46.083
Died in St. Mary's
fairgrounds in '71.

05:46.166 --> 05:47.417
Ruled accidental.

05:47.500 --> 05:48.750
More like inevitable.

05:48.834 --> 05:50.542
Flying through the air
on nothing but silk?

05:50.625 --> 05:52.166
Not much here by the way
of statements.

05:52.250 --> 05:54.291
Well, getting circus
folk
to talk isn't easy.

05:54.375 --> 05:56.333
Finally got warrants, you're
looking at an empty lot.

05:56.417 --> 05:58.875
(Miller)
Assigned spoke to
a few audience members.

05:58.959 --> 06:00.875
Said Mia looked fine
giving her pre-act bow.

06:00.959 --> 06:02.458
So whatever happened to her,
happened backstage.

06:02.542 --> 06:05.083
It's got the stink
of sabotage all over it.

06:05.166 --> 06:07.041
A/v blew up the picture
of Mia's fall.

06:07.125 --> 06:09.750
ME said the shadow around her
nose and mouth could be blood.

06:09.834 --> 06:11.875
- Before impact.
- 'Autopsy report.'

06:11.959 --> 06:13.333
Broken neck,
shattered skull

06:13.417 --> 06:14.875
thought to have been
caused by the fall

06:14.959 --> 06:17.458
but hands and wrists only
suffered minor damage.

06:17.542 --> 06:18.792
She didn't brace for impact.

06:18.875 --> 06:20.542
Survival instinct
never kicked in.

06:20.625 --> 06:22.375
(Stillman)
'Run all the performers
for priors'

06:22.458 --> 06:24.792
anything else we can
dig up on this big
top.

06:24.875 --> 06:27.375
"Mia was legally adopted
by Sheldon Burgess

06:27.458 --> 06:28.792
AKA Cleo the clown."

06:28.875 --> 06:30.041
Never gave a statement.

06:30.125 --> 06:31.792
Got an address
over in point breeze.

06:31.875 --> 06:34.000
Well, go talk
to this clown.

06:43.834 --> 06:45.250
- Mr. Burgess?
- Hey, hey!

06:45.333 --> 06:46.959
Hey, hey! Hey, welcome
to Cleo's fun house.

06:47.041 --> 06:48.709
What can I do for you?

06:48.792 --> 06:53.250
Homicide. We're looking
into the death of Mia Romanov.

06:53.333 --> 06:54.917
Mia?

06:56.041 --> 06:57.208
All these years later?

06:57.291 --> 06:59.542
What can you tell us
about her fall?

06:59.625 --> 07:01.709
She was trying a new stunt.

07:03.750 --> 07:05.417
It's the worst night of my life.

07:05.500 --> 07:09.208
(Valens)
How come you didn't give a
statement, Mr. Burgess?

07:09.291 --> 07:11.000
I climbed deep into
a bottle that night.

07:11.083 --> 07:12.667
Stayed there
for
a long time
after.

07:12.750 --> 07:15.125
It never crossed your mind
that
maybe it wasn't an accident?

07:15.208 --> 07:17.792
No. Silks weren't cut or frayed.

07:17.875 --> 07:19.667
Thought the moment
got the best of
her.

07:19.750 --> 07:22.125
So who was in charge
of sending up her cocoon?

07:22.208 --> 07:23.959
Uh, Gaucho, day
players, in and
out.

07:24.041 --> 07:26.917
But Mia did her own rigging.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.291
She was stubborn,
like her father.

07:29.375 --> 07:31.000
Her father?

07:32.834 --> 07:35.041
The Romanovs have been
kicking the sawdust

07:35.125 --> 07:37.375
for five generations.

07:38.750 --> 07:41.000
They were royalty
amongst us kinkers.

07:41.083 --> 07:43.208
And Mia was like her folks

07:43.291 --> 07:46.125
more comfortable in the air
than on terra firma.

07:46.208 --> 07:49.709
(Valens)
How does a clown in a
traveling
circus adopt a little girl?

07:49.792 --> 07:51.333
I was her godfather.

07:51.417 --> 07:54.875
Her parents willed her to me,
but the circus raised her.

07:54.959 --> 07:57.792
Jones brothers was a one-ring
mud show, but we were family.

07:57.875 --> 07:59.542
Anyone backstage with her?

07:59.625 --> 08:03.709
No. The act before hers, Zelda
"The queen of knives" Panay.

08:03.792 --> 08:05.667
Zelda and Mia
get on
alright?

08:05.750 --> 08:08.500
Oh, sure. Long as Zelda
was the headliner.

08:10.208 --> 08:12.375
What the hell was that
tonight? Williamsport?

08:12.458 --> 08:14.041
Used to pack 'em
to the stingers.

08:14.125 --> 08:16.250
Now, we're lucky to be making
horse feed out there.

08:16.333 --> 08:17.542
You still getting paid, Cleo?

08:17.625 --> 08:19.583
This dog and pony show
is dying, Biggie.

08:19.667 --> 08:21.375
We need an aerial act.

08:21.458 --> 08:24.125
(Biggie)
Can't afford one, so' unless
you
got one in that wig of yours

08:24.208 --> 08:26.000
no way a knife-thrower
can carry the big top.

08:26.083 --> 08:27.542
- Excuse me?
- No offense, Zelda.

08:27.625 --> 08:29.000
- I've been--
- Stop it.

08:29.083 --> 08:32.667
Everybody, please, just..

08:32.750 --> 08:35.250
I ca-I can give us
an aerial act.

08:35.333 --> 08:36.875
Mia, I didn't
mean you should--

08:36.959 --> 08:40.125
I can fly. It's
in my blood.

08:40.208 --> 08:41.291
She's a baby.

08:41.375 --> 08:42.709
Well, what do we
got to lose?

08:42.792 --> 08:45.500
Even a baby can
see we're dying.

08:48.041 --> 08:49.375
I'll talk to management.

08:49.458 --> 08:52.417
Start putting it together, kid.

08:52.500 --> 08:53.709
I don't know, Mia.

08:53.792 --> 08:55.709
It's going to be fine, Cleo.

08:57.542 --> 08:58.792
Oops.

09:02.291 --> 09:04.333
Accidents happen.

09:07.875 --> 09:10.667
(Valens)
Zelda p-a-n-a-y...

09:10.750 --> 09:12.166
...was the headliner
prior to Mia?

09:12.250 --> 09:14.375
Yeah, ever since
the last aerial act walked.

09:14.458 --> 09:16.917
I didn't want Mia up there.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.875
Hate to think
I put a target on her.

09:18.959 --> 09:23.333
Sounds like Zelda wasn't ready
to put her knives away.

09:25.875 --> 09:27.083
Thanks for coming in.

09:27.166 --> 09:28.834
Well, if I'd known
you were so handsome

09:28.917 --> 09:32.625
'I would've sprinted all
the way from Atlantic city.'

09:32.709 --> 09:34.625
I don't mean to be
rude, but, uh..

09:34.709 --> 09:38.417
can we get going on this
because, I got a show, at 6:
00.

09:38.500 --> 09:40.083
- Still performing?
- Yeah.

09:40.166 --> 09:43.041
Well, it's mostly blue
plate dinners for
seniors.

09:43.125 --> 09:46.250
But they remember me
<i>the Ed Sullivan</i>
<i>show.</i>

09:46.333 --> 09:49.000
How did you and
Mia Romanov get along?

09:49.083 --> 09:51.166
<i>Mia Romanov?</i>

09:52.750 --> 09:54.125
Fine.

09:54.208 --> 09:55.500
I took her under my wing.

09:55.583 --> 09:57.333
She was like my sister.

09:57.417 --> 09:59.834
You always throw
daggers at family?

09:59.917 --> 10:02.000
[laughs]
Darling..

10:02.083 --> 10:05.041
...even a lady loses
her cool sometimes

10:05.125 --> 10:06.750
which accounts for three

10:06.834 --> 10:08.709
out of my four divorces.

10:08.792 --> 10:10.959
Foolish. Jealous.

10:11.041 --> 10:12.625
Jealous enough
to get rid of her?

10:12.709 --> 10:14.667
What do you mean?

10:14.750 --> 10:18.291
She fell.
I was
there.

10:18.375 --> 10:20.583
(Miller)
'You were there backstage
before her act.'

10:20.667 --> 10:22.500
sister

10:22.583 --> 10:24.458
and you get to keep
your spotlight.

10:24.542 --> 10:26.875
Now, I got my pride.

10:26.959 --> 10:28.792
But I'm not stupid.

10:28.875 --> 10:30.709
We needed Mia's
act to work.

10:30.792 --> 10:34.125
It was all over,
for all of us.

10:41.291 --> 10:43.375
- Where's the Trapeze bar?
- Forget the Trapeze.

10:43.458 --> 10:45.375
Biggie, we need something new.

10:45.458 --> 10:46.542
We need dramatic.

10:46.625 --> 10:48.166
You'll never be ready
in a week trying

10:48.250 --> 10:50.875
to get a new act together. Just
do what your folks taught you.

10:50.959 --> 10:53.166
I need a theme.
To tell a story.

10:53.250 --> 10:56.208
- I need some time.
- You're not a clown anymore.

10:56.291 --> 10:58.208
It's not about stories.
It's about wowing them.

10:58.291 --> 11:00.875
Yeah, that's what I'm trying
to
do, There's something groovy

11:00.959 --> 11:02.333
with the silks,
the freedom it gives
me--

11:02.417 --> 11:03.667
People don't want groovy.

11:03.750 --> 11:05.083
They want tradition.

11:05.166 --> 11:07.083
For their kids to see
and feel what they did.

11:07.166 --> 11:09.166
Maybe we can start a new one.

11:09.250 --> 11:10.917
You know, we can capture
their imagination.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.417
Great. Then imagine there's no
circus when we get shut down

11:14.500 --> 11:16.166
waiting for you
to get your act together.

11:16.250 --> 11:17.375
Now this is all on me?

11:17.458 --> 11:18.667
You asked
for a shot, kid

11:18.750 --> 11:19.959
and I gave it to you.

11:20.041 --> 11:22.083
Convinced management
to roll the dice.

11:22.166 --> 11:23.875
- Don't hang me out to dry.
- No, I'll do the silk act.

11:23.959 --> 11:25.959
I'll use a
mechanic
if I have to.

11:26.041 --> 11:27.583
The advance men have
been pumping your act

11:27.667 --> 11:28.792
as death-defying.

11:28.875 --> 11:30.250
- But I--
- But nothing!

11:31.291 --> 11:33.709
I took a flyer on you.

11:33.792 --> 11:36.625
You'd better not
make a fool of me.

11:43.083 --> 11:46.291
Mia was way ahead of the curve.

11:46.375 --> 11:50.125
<i>cirque du soleil</i>
before they were.

11:50.208 --> 11:52.750
Now everybody's got a silk act.

11:52.834 --> 11:54.208
What about David
and Goliath?

11:54.291 --> 11:56.792
Ringmaster Biggie Jones
and his goon

11:56.875 --> 11:59.291
Lester Gargantuan Smith.

12:00.500 --> 12:02.208
Biggie pushed us hard.

12:02.291 --> 12:04.291
Maybe pushed Mia too hard.

12:05.792 --> 12:08.458
That's probably why he
pulled up stakes so
fast

12:08.542 --> 12:10.625
and left town that night.

12:10.709 --> 12:13.458
You see Biggie backstage
with Mia before her fall?

12:13.542 --> 12:17.542
Biggie always checked
on the featured acts

12:17.625 --> 12:19.250
before they went on.

12:21.333 --> 12:23.500
(female #1)
'Have information
that you called in'

12:23.583 --> 12:25.083
'the 10-37 last week.'

12:25.166 --> 12:29.291
- 'DUI check on Mr.
Kitchener?'
- That's right.

12:29.375 --> 12:31.291
Outside the same bar
that he was murdered?

12:31.375 --> 12:32.500
The suspect was inebriated.

12:32.583 --> 12:34.333
Suspect was awaiting trial.

12:34.417 --> 12:35.500
And what were you doing

12:35.583 --> 12:36.750
observing him in
the first place?

12:36.834 --> 12:38.542
It was a
continuing
investigation.

12:38.625 --> 12:40.750
He had already filed
a complaint against you.

12:40.834 --> 12:43.834
Which was completely
bogus, same as this.

12:43.917 --> 12:46.959
Were you outside that bar
last night, detective?

12:48.834 --> 12:50.458
No.

12:50.542 --> 12:54.041
(female #1)
'You testified Moe Kitchener
tried to kill you.'

12:54.125 --> 12:55.834
'And you believe that?'

12:55.917 --> 12:57.917
And so does the commonwealth.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.542
Maybe you should
talk to the DA.

12:59.625 --> 13:02.875
Said you were home last night
between the hours of 9:25

13:02.959 --> 13:04.125
and 10:10?

13:04.208 --> 13:05.625
That's right.

13:05.709 --> 13:08.291
Anyone who can
confirm that?

13:09.834 --> 13:11.500
My partner, Scotty Valens.

13:11.583 --> 13:13.875
He came by, dropped
off some paperwork

13:13.959 --> 13:15.542
on a case I was reviewing.

13:15.625 --> 13:17.417
What case?

13:18.125 --> 13:19.667
Cesar Rodriguez.

13:19.750 --> 13:21.875
The file's on my desk.

13:27.458 --> 13:29.834
Bunch of gink squad BS.

13:31.208 --> 13:33.583
I need you to
surrender
your service weapon.

13:33.667 --> 13:36.166
What?

13:36.250 --> 13:39.250
Until this thing blows
over,
you're on restricted
duty.

13:49.458 --> 13:51.875
Mia Romanov.

13:51.959 --> 13:53.458
A real tragedy, that one.

13:53.542 --> 13:56.500
Understand you checked on your
acts before they hit the stage.

13:56.583 --> 13:58.041
So how'd she look
before going out?

13:58.125 --> 14:00.041
Ready to fly. Girl
was good to go.

14:00.125 --> 14:03.083
You're saying she looked
good,
Biggie, ready to fly?

14:03.166 --> 14:06.667
You whizzing on the wrong
hydrant there, Kemosabe.

14:06.750 --> 14:08.750
I needed that girl.

14:08.834 --> 14:14.000
Without her act I lost my
main
moneymaker, lost the
midway.

14:14.083 --> 14:16.000
Lost that.

14:16.083 --> 14:17.250
Lost the circus.

14:17.333 --> 14:18.917
Then why the cover-up?

14:19.000 --> 14:21.166
You pulled up stakes
before sunup, hit the road.

14:21.250 --> 14:23.125
Now, hold your horses.

14:23.208 --> 14:25.792
We had a long haul the
next day to Allentown.

14:25.875 --> 14:27.041
The show must go on, huh?

14:27.125 --> 14:30.083
Well, we was
feeding
a lot of people.

14:30.166 --> 14:32.500
My family
survived
the ten-in-one

14:32.583 --> 14:34.458
to turn around
and own this
circus.

14:34.542 --> 14:36.417
Ten-in-ones?

14:36.500 --> 14:38.750
Ten freaks in one tent.

14:38.834 --> 14:41.166
It was humiliating.

14:41.250 --> 14:45.125
For three generations we fought
off larger predatory circuses.

14:45.208 --> 14:46.583
Ringling.

14:46.667 --> 14:48.083
(Miller)
'And you banked
everything on Mia'

14:48.166 --> 14:49.417
but she crossed you up.

14:49.500 --> 14:50.875
We were family.

14:50.959 --> 14:52.125
Wouldn't sell.

14:52.208 --> 14:55.333
Loyal. We circled
the tents around
Mia.

14:55.417 --> 14:58.083
But Mia stepped out of line,
made her own act, didn't she?

14:58.166 --> 14:59.500
She make a fool
out of you, Biggie?

14:59.583 --> 15:01.291
Wrong.

15:01.375 --> 15:03.458
I was on board with her act.

15:03.542 --> 15:06.417
Hell, I had to be,
times was desperate.

15:06.500 --> 15:09.834
I helped her set
the whole thing up.

15:14.333 --> 15:15.500
You heard of knocking?

15:15.583 --> 15:17.333
Peace offering.

15:17.417 --> 15:18.834
Thought about what you said.

15:18.917 --> 15:20.333
Wanting a
story
for your act.

15:20.417 --> 15:22.083
How about this?

15:22.166 --> 15:25.291
Silk worm goes up
into her cocoon

15:25.375 --> 15:27.709
to emerge as the
human butterfly.

15:29.625 --> 15:31.875
Call it the
metamorphosis.

15:36.041 --> 15:37.875
I don't know what to say.

15:37.959 --> 15:43.500
- Biggie, that's...perfect.
- So are you, kid.

15:43.583 --> 15:45.625
We're all behind you
here.
You're the best we got.

15:45.709 --> 15:46.917
I'll be ready
for Philly.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.417
And no mechanic
or safety harness.

15:49.500 --> 15:51.583
Knock 'em dead, kid.

15:53.583 --> 15:54.834
I got an act, Lester.

15:54.917 --> 15:57.083
I'm the human butterfly.

16:05.125 --> 16:07.583
Management had them tack
spitters wallpaper

16:07.667 --> 16:08.875
the town with that bill.

16:08.959 --> 16:10.750
She was our homegrown star.

16:10.834 --> 16:12.041
And who was management?

16:12.125 --> 16:15.458
J.B. Ricketts investment.

16:15.542 --> 16:18.375
Bunch of suits out of Florida.

16:18.458 --> 16:20.333
Helped us through
the lean years.

16:20.417 --> 16:21.542
Got a number?

16:21.625 --> 16:23.375
[laughs]
No, ma'am.

16:23.458 --> 16:25.834
That was a long time ago.

16:25.917 --> 16:28.125
- 'What about this Paul
Bunyan?'
- He have a thing for Mia?

16:28.208 --> 16:32.500
[laughing]
Gargantuan? I don't think
he was wired that way.

16:32.583 --> 16:36.875
His feelings were
simple, childlike.

16:36.959 --> 16:38.875
With big boy plumbing,
that's reassuring.

16:38.959 --> 16:41.750
- Some kind of condition?
- Cerebral gigantism.

16:43.125 --> 16:45.500
Made him huge.

16:45.583 --> 16:48.250
Also made him about as
sharp as a bowling
ball.

16:48.333 --> 16:50.250
So what beanstalk
is he up right
now?

16:50.333 --> 16:51.917
I haven't seen him in years.

16:52.000 --> 16:55.333
He's probably dead.
Giants don't last too
long.

16:55.417 --> 16:57.625
Heart can't take it.

16:57.709 --> 17:01.917
Excuse me, um, I'd like
to talk to a Detective
Rush.

17:02.750 --> 17:04.083
'Thank you.'

17:08.875 --> 17:11.750
Mr. Butler.

17:11.834 --> 17:15.125
- What can I do for you?
- I want to make a statement.

17:18.875 --> 17:20.917
Would you like a lawyer
present, Mr. Butler?

17:21.000 --> 17:22.083
I would not.

17:22.166 --> 17:24.792
I recommend you get one, Hank.

17:24.875 --> 17:26.333
With all you've been through.

17:29.250 --> 17:31.625
My wife doesn't eat anymore.

17:32.834 --> 17:35.625
She doesn't sleep.

17:35.709 --> 17:37.291
She just cries.

17:39.750 --> 17:42.208
Do you want to tell us
what happened, Hank?

17:48.583 --> 17:51.792
When I saw him
at the courthouse, I knew.

17:53.500 --> 17:54.667
Moe Kitchener?

17:54.750 --> 17:57.083
(Hank)
'Ten, 20 years,
didn't matter.'

17:58.375 --> 18:00.500
It wouldn't go away.

18:00.583 --> 18:01.792
'I couldn't go on'

18:01.875 --> 18:04.083
thinking that-that
smug son of a bitch

18:04.166 --> 18:05.834
was walking the earth.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.709
Someone had to put
that dog down.

18:28.583 --> 18:30.834
Hank.

18:30.917 --> 18:32.291
Listen, Hank, I didn't
kill your daughter.

18:32.375 --> 18:35.917
Shut up. You buried
her in a box.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.750
You let me twist forever.

18:39.667 --> 18:41.834
Sorry, Hank.
It wasn't personal.

18:45.750 --> 18:47.333
I'm sorry, too.

18:53.125 --> 18:54.709
I went home.

19:01.792 --> 19:03.375
I thought I'd feel better.

19:05.667 --> 19:07.500
Katie's gone.

19:13.500 --> 19:15.542
Nothing's ever going
to change that.

19:30.792 --> 19:34.583
What do you want?
What do you want?

19:34.667 --> 19:36.250
Leave me alone.
You hear me?

19:36.333 --> 19:38.709
I seen you standing here.

19:38.792 --> 19:42.125
[straining]
I'm a cop.

19:48.208 --> 19:49.667
'I'm sorry.'

19:49.750 --> 19:51.625
Police. I didn't know!

19:51.709 --> 19:52.959
I didn't know!

19:53.041 --> 19:55.041
I-I didn't know.

20:04.208 --> 20:07.208
People paint on my wall..

20:07.291 --> 20:10.083
...break my windows.

20:10.166 --> 20:11.667
I thought you was one of 'em.

20:11.750 --> 20:13.291
Gonna hurt me.

20:13.375 --> 20:16.291
I
gonna
you,

20:16.375 --> 20:17.834
(Vera)
'Lot of performers
at Jones brothers'

20:17.917 --> 20:19.166
had priors, Lester.

20:19.250 --> 20:20.959
You're the only one
with a history of violence.

20:21.041 --> 20:22.834
(Valens)
'In and out of
institutions as a kid.'

20:22.917 --> 20:27.667
Beat a grown man within an inch
of his life at the age of 13.

20:27.750 --> 20:30.291
He attacked me..

20:30.375 --> 20:32.792
...'cause I was big.

20:32.875 --> 20:34.458
What about Mia Romanov?

20:37.709 --> 20:40.125
Yeah, you...
remember her, right?

20:40.208 --> 20:43.750
Yes. Mia.

20:43.834 --> 20:45.208
You liked her?

20:45.291 --> 20:46.959
Pretty. Soft.

20:47.041 --> 20:48.875
'She smelled nice.'

20:48.959 --> 20:51.417
She just wasn't into the
whole
beauty and the beast

20:51.500 --> 20:53.750
(Valens)
'So you squeezed
her too hard'

20:53.834 --> 20:55.166
like you did me?

20:55.250 --> 20:56.667
No!

20:56.750 --> 20:58.875
Mia was special.

20:58.959 --> 21:02.000
- "Special"?
- Friend.

21:02.083 --> 21:04.375
She was my friend.

21:04.458 --> 21:06.500
I could never hurt her.

21:06.583 --> 21:09.500
Well, someone did hurt
friend,

21:09.583 --> 21:10.917
'Someone backstage.'

21:11.000 --> 21:13.875
And then they dropped
her from the ceiling.

21:21.083 --> 21:22.417
There was this Gaucho.

21:32.583 --> 21:35.375
- Hey. Eddie, right?
- That's right, darlin'.

21:35.458 --> 21:37.417
I haven't checked my rig yet.

21:37.500 --> 21:38.917
It's looking fine to me.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.208
Get rid of that carabiner
and mount it on a swivel.

21:41.291 --> 21:43.208
Carabiner's twice as
strong as a swivel.

21:43.291 --> 21:45.208
What do I look like,
some first of may?

21:45.291 --> 21:47.875
That swivel's going to let me
get out over the audience.

21:47.959 --> 21:49.291
Now, lose the carabiner.

21:50.959 --> 21:53.000
Looks like you're calling the
shots around here, huh, kid?

21:53.083 --> 21:54.542
How long you
been doing this, Eddie?

21:54.625 --> 21:56.625
Ten years experience, rigged
every big rock and roll

21:56.709 --> 21:58.041
show from Vancouver to Miami.

21:58.125 --> 22:00.208
Then you should know a performer
needs to check their rig

22:00.291 --> 22:01.792
before it's flown.

22:03.458 --> 22:04.792
How old are you, sweet cheeks?

22:04.875 --> 22:07.417
Old enough. Are you
hopped up, Eddie?

22:09.458 --> 22:11.625
I'm the one 50 feet in the air.

22:11.709 --> 22:13.458
If you're gonna be on that
junk, you can stay

22:13.542 --> 22:15.291
away from me and my rig.

22:16.375 --> 22:18.542
I want you out
of my tent. Now!

22:18.625 --> 22:21.458
Get out. Or I'll
have
you dragged out.

22:21.542 --> 22:23.291
Alright, look.
Easy, big fella, easy.

22:23.375 --> 22:25.458
Alright, I dig it.

22:25.542 --> 22:27.583
If that's what the
little lady wants.

22:30.750 --> 22:31.875
Ouch!

22:31.959 --> 22:34.417
Now that would hurt.

22:40.083 --> 22:42.709
Eddie wasn't one of us.

22:42.792 --> 22:45.250
Not circus folk.

22:47.875 --> 22:50.333
He poisoned her.

22:50.417 --> 22:52.750
You mean with drugs?

22:52.834 --> 22:54.875
Was he selling to the crew?

22:54.959 --> 22:58.542
This rigger, he responsible for
putting Mia's cocoon in the air?

22:58.625 --> 23:02.000
Till she kicked him
out of the big top.

23:05.709 --> 23:09.750
They made him shovel
after the elephants.

23:10.917 --> 23:12.667
Eddie left..

23:12.750 --> 23:16.667
...after Mia..

23:16.750 --> 23:18.750
...fell.

23:29.041 --> 23:30.291
I went to Jones.

23:30.375 --> 23:31.750
The bartender said
you took Nick home.

23:31.834 --> 23:34.542
Yeah. He was plastered
by the time I got there.

23:34.625 --> 23:36.875
- Something's up.
- Lot of that going around.

23:36.959 --> 23:39.834
- Hmm.
- Still thirsty?

23:41.750 --> 23:44.375
I heard about your
dance with Gargantuan.

23:46.125 --> 23:48.625
Had him right
where
I wanted him.

23:48.709 --> 23:49.792
Yeah.

23:49.875 --> 23:51.166
You ring him up
for assault?

23:51.250 --> 23:54.500
Guy belongs in the
puzzle
house, not county.

23:54.583 --> 23:56.500
'Punks were
harassing him.'

23:56.583 --> 23:58.875
freak

23:58.959 --> 24:00.000
Cruel world.

24:00.083 --> 24:02.000
'I filed three separate
police reports.'

24:02.083 --> 24:05.375
He was just protecting himself.

24:09.208 --> 24:10.417
I'm sorry I wasn't there.

24:10.500 --> 24:13.792
Almost...lit him up, Lil.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.125
Wanted to.

24:16.208 --> 24:20.208
Thanks for...having my back.

24:20.291 --> 24:22.750
With Moe. The alibi.

24:22.834 --> 24:25.375
Partners, right?

24:25.458 --> 24:27.375
Yeah.

24:32.250 --> 24:33.834
I still can't believe it.

24:33.917 --> 24:36.333
- What Hank did.
- Just beat you to it.

24:36.417 --> 24:38.458
So what does that make me?

24:40.125 --> 24:41.417
Human.

24:41.500 --> 24:44.917
- Protect and serve, right?
- 'The innocent.'

24:45.000 --> 24:46.333
Lil.

24:47.709 --> 24:50.208
Need more Hanks out there.

24:50.291 --> 24:52.917
The guy deserves a medal.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.667
You believe that?

24:56.583 --> 24:57.750
Yeah.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.458
Yeah, I believe that.

25:02.125 --> 25:05.417
Just be glad
someone else did
it.

25:05.500 --> 25:07.375
That he's gone.

25:10.333 --> 25:13.959
That fortune-teller said
something about your mom.

25:14.041 --> 25:16.583
'She okay?'

25:16.667 --> 25:19.542
Time comes, Lil.

25:19.625 --> 25:22.375
I might need you
to have my back,
too.

25:24.458 --> 25:25.917
Partners, right?

25:41.458 --> 25:43.417
- Thought I was invisible.
- So did we.

25:43.500 --> 25:45.625
Till we found your name
in a Jones brothers payroll.

25:45.709 --> 25:47.500
Quite a healthy rap sheet
you got there, Eddie.

25:47.583 --> 25:49.792
Mama always said I had a
little
bit of the devil in me.

25:49.875 --> 25:52.291
Sure she's
real
proud, drugs

25:52.375 --> 25:54.166
cons, kiting checks.

25:54.250 --> 25:57.291
Youthful
indiscretions,
detectives.

25:57.375 --> 25:58.625
Made a few mistakes.

25:58.709 --> 26:02.041
Is she one of those
indiscretions?

26:02.125 --> 26:03.625
You might say that.

26:03.709 --> 26:05.625
But she was far
from a mistake.

26:05.709 --> 26:06.959
(Vera)
'Destroying Mia's rig'

26:07.041 --> 26:08.375
threatening her
in front of witnesses.

26:08.458 --> 26:09.625
- Those aren't mistakes?
- Wait a second.

26:09.709 --> 26:11.041
I didn't even work the big top.

26:11.125 --> 26:12.417
I know. She had
you kicked out.

26:12.500 --> 26:14.458
Had you shoveling
pachyderm pies.

26:14.542 --> 26:16.667
Cost you money, not
to mention your
pride.

26:16.750 --> 26:17.959
About to narc you out.

26:18.041 --> 26:19.375
But you weren't
looking to do jail time

26:19.458 --> 26:20.625
so you did her instead.

26:20.709 --> 26:24.208
You got me. Guilty as charged.

26:24.291 --> 26:27.166
- If you call love a crime.
- "Love"?

26:27.250 --> 26:29.417
Anyone could see
that-that girl

26:29.500 --> 26:31.417
was a bud about to bloom.

26:31.500 --> 26:33.500
All she needed was
a double dose of
Eddie.

26:33.583 --> 26:35.500
I might just hit you
on principle.

26:35.583 --> 26:38.166
Seem to have that
effect on women.

26:38.250 --> 26:40.667
The other side of desire.

26:40.750 --> 26:42.166
'That young lady'

26:42.250 --> 26:43.792
was bursting with it.

26:57.583 --> 27:00.208
Hey, I'm sorry about yesterday.

27:00.291 --> 27:02.625
I've been shoveling
crap my whole life.

27:02.709 --> 27:05.125
So don't lose any
sleep over me,
okay?

27:06.750 --> 27:07.959
I'm just under
a lot of pressure

27:08.041 --> 27:11.500
and I could've
handled it better.

27:13.709 --> 27:15.792
I heard about your folks.

27:15.875 --> 27:19.542
It takes a lot of guts
doing what you're
doing.

27:19.625 --> 27:21.208
Well, I don't really know
what else to do.

27:21.291 --> 27:24.417
I mean...family needs me.

27:24.500 --> 27:26.667
I guess you had to grow up
a little fast around here.

27:26.750 --> 27:29.917
So maybe, you and I
aren't
so different after all.

27:31.458 --> 27:33.041
Sounds like you've
been around quite a bit.

27:33.125 --> 27:36.458
What about you? I never heard
of
a circus that didn't travel.

27:36.542 --> 27:37.709
I've been to a bunch of places

27:37.792 --> 27:39.959
but I never get
to leave the lot.

27:40.041 --> 27:41.291
Never?

27:42.709 --> 27:45.125
Once.

27:45.208 --> 27:49.083
When I was a little girl, my mom
took me down to Bourbon street.

27:49.166 --> 27:50.750
New Orleans.

27:50.834 --> 27:53.000
There was one
of those jazz funerals.

27:54.000 --> 27:57.667
Something eerie about it, but..

27:57.750 --> 27:59.458
...it was beautiful.

28:09.500 --> 28:11.083
We should go out tonight.

28:12.625 --> 28:15.125
I'm not sure Cleo
would like that.

28:15.208 --> 28:18.875
Not all
adventures
are out there.

29:11.041 --> 29:12.792
You should
come with me.

29:14.917 --> 29:16.417
Where?

29:17.750 --> 29:20.542
Anywhere but this
stick and rag
show.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.375
(Eddie)
'You're 18. You can
do anything you want.'

29:25.458 --> 29:27.625
Mia! Giving it up
to some gaucho!

29:27.709 --> 29:28.917
Have you lost
your mind?

29:29.000 --> 29:30.250
- Come on!
- No!

29:30.333 --> 29:32.834
- Get out. Come with me!
- Wait..

29:32.917 --> 29:34.125
(Mia)
'Cleo! No!'

29:34.208 --> 29:35.792
(Cleo)
'Come on!'

29:41.583 --> 29:42.709
I felt bad for Mia.

29:42.792 --> 29:44.041
If you ask me,
there was something

29:44.125 --> 29:46.417
weird was going on
between those two.

29:46.500 --> 29:49.208
You know, she was 18 and they
were still sharing a boxcar.

29:49.291 --> 29:50.333
Sketchy.

29:50.417 --> 29:52.291
Sketchier than an
alcoholic clown?

29:52.375 --> 29:55.208
Next day, she had a busted lip..

29:55.291 --> 29:56.583
...compliments of Cleo.

29:56.667 --> 29:59.709
You painted a pretty
picture of Mia, Cleo.

29:59.792 --> 30:03.208
But, uh, but she wasn't such
an angel, now, was she?

30:03.291 --> 30:07.291
Droppin' acid, doing
riggers,
then there's you.

30:07.375 --> 30:09.250
Me? What the hell's
that supposed to mean?

30:09.333 --> 30:11.041
Keeping tight quarters
with a teenage girl

30:11.125 --> 30:12.917
all those years...
used to having her

30:13.000 --> 30:14.125
by your side.

30:14.208 --> 30:17.250
- What are you saying?
- Take a seat.

30:19.125 --> 30:20.917
I slept on the floor.

30:22.834 --> 30:25.083
I would never, ever do
what you're suggesting.

30:25.166 --> 30:27.208
- Mia was my daughter.
- She was not blood.

30:27.291 --> 30:29.041
Was to me!

30:29.125 --> 30:30.542
Maybe I was strict
and overprotective

30:30.625 --> 30:32.542
but that place was
swarming with snakes.

30:32.625 --> 30:36.250
- Like Eddie Armstrong?
- Damn straight.

30:36.333 --> 30:39.625
Combed the lot, found her
tripping with that..

30:39.709 --> 30:41.250
...fink trying
to get in her pants.

30:41.333 --> 30:42.583
I just snapped.

30:42.667 --> 30:44.667
Oh, busted her lip trying
to show her who's boss.

30:44.750 --> 30:48.709
No! Never laid a hand on her.

30:48.792 --> 30:50.291
She was so out of
it,
kept falling.

30:50.375 --> 30:53.458
I watched her all night
till she finally came
down.

30:53.542 --> 30:55.166
Always there to catch her, huh?

30:56.750 --> 30:59.291
Not always.

30:59.375 --> 31:00.959
But I tried.

31:01.041 --> 31:03.250
But you couldn't let go.

31:03.333 --> 31:05.750
And all you had was
her and that bottle.

31:05.834 --> 31:08.375
She was becoming a woman.
You were losing her.

31:08.458 --> 31:11.750
Holding her back so much
that...
you were suffocating her.

31:11.834 --> 31:13.083
No, you're wrong.

31:13.166 --> 31:15.667
Loved her so much,
I wanted her to go.

31:15.750 --> 31:18.500
She needed to get away
from that place.

31:19.834 --> 31:21.208
From me.

32:52.083 --> 32:53.458
(Biggie)
'Let's hear it, Scranton'

32:53.542 --> 32:57.208
'for Mia Romanov and her
<i>metamorphosis!'</i>

32:57.291 --> 32:59.125
What's wrong, Cleo?

33:00.250 --> 33:03.041
You were...beautiful.

33:03.125 --> 33:05.834
You looked just like
your mother up there.

33:05.917 --> 33:07.542
- You liked it?
- I've seen the future

33:07.625 --> 33:08.625
And you're it, kiddo.

33:08.709 --> 33:10.375
Your act is too good
for this top.

33:10.458 --> 33:12.583
What are you talking about?
This is exactly what we
need.

33:12.667 --> 33:14.041
You heard the
crowd.
This will save us.

33:14.125 --> 33:17.583
This place is dying. You
don't need to die with it.

33:17.667 --> 33:19.041
But this is my family.

33:19.125 --> 33:20.792
Cleo, I'm not going anywhere.

33:20.875 --> 33:25.250
You know how...when
a circus elephant is born

33:25.333 --> 33:28.375
the bull handler will secure
it with a thin rope

33:28.458 --> 33:30.291
tied to a skinny stick
in the ground?

33:30.375 --> 33:32.458
Sure, and when
that elephant grows
up

33:32.542 --> 33:36.667
that rope and skinny
stick
can still make him stay
put.

33:36.750 --> 33:39.709
That stick can't
hold you anymore.

33:41.291 --> 33:43.250
Are you calling me an elephant?

33:49.583 --> 33:53.000
I wish she'd listened to me,
but it was already too late.

33:53.083 --> 33:54.291
She fell the next night.

33:54.375 --> 33:57.208
Buried her in
the Romanov family plot.

33:57.291 --> 34:01.083
A few days later, I was back
on the sawdust in Allentown.

34:01.166 --> 34:02.333
A few days?

34:02.417 --> 34:04.291
Thought the circus
was
due in Allentown

34:04.375 --> 34:05.625
the night after the accident?

34:05.709 --> 34:06.834
Don't know who told you that.

34:06.917 --> 34:09.375
No, we had a week
between stops.

34:09.458 --> 34:11.333
Got the route card
to prove it.

34:16.375 --> 34:19.000
(Rush)
Losing track of all
your lies, Biggie.

34:19.083 --> 34:20.959
Told us you were due
in Allentown when you

34:21.041 --> 34:22.458
had a week between gigs.

34:22.542 --> 34:26.291
We had to wildcat it out
of there after Mia's
nosedive.

34:26.375 --> 34:29.750
Especially since you had
a murder scene to tear
down.

34:29.834 --> 34:31.375
Come on, who's going
to take their kiddies

34:31.458 --> 34:33.583
to see us after
a fall like that?

34:33.667 --> 34:34.959
Thought with a little
extra time, we could

34:35.041 --> 34:37.458
drum up some business
in Allentown.

34:39.500 --> 34:42.250
I know what it looks like, but
it was a business decision.

34:42.333 --> 34:44.291
You weren't the only one
making business decisions.

34:44.375 --> 34:46.625
Found out Ringling
brothers wanted Mia.

34:46.709 --> 34:49.750
Ringling, they
tried
to poach
everyone.

34:49.834 --> 34:51.834
After everything your
family had done for
her.

34:51.917 --> 34:53.500
Raising Mia as
one of their
own.

34:53.583 --> 34:56.667
Knew if you lost her, it was all
over. Mia wouldn't fall in line.

34:56.750 --> 34:59.417
Left a little man with a big
temper holding the bag.

34:59.500 --> 35:01.667
And when it's
all
said and done

35:01.750 --> 35:03.500
Mia ends up eating sawdust.

35:03.583 --> 35:06.166
Come on, you guys.

35:06.250 --> 35:08.834
Do I look like
I could hurt anyone?

35:08.917 --> 35:11.083
(Rush)
'Spoke to Biggie, Lester.'

35:11.166 --> 35:12.792
Remember him?

35:12.875 --> 35:14.375
Yes. Biggie.

35:14.458 --> 35:17.792
(Valens)
Well, he says
you

35:17.875 --> 35:19.166
Me?

35:19.250 --> 35:20.709
(Rush)
'Biggie couldn't
have killed Mia.'

35:20.792 --> 35:23.959
Couldn't have lifted
her
up into that cocoon.

35:24.041 --> 35:25.333
(Valens)
'I'm thinking he'

35:25.417 --> 35:28.083
forced you to do it, Lester.

35:28.166 --> 35:30.792
Like he always forced you.

35:30.875 --> 35:33.041
(Rush)
'You don't have to be
scared of Biggie anymore.'

35:33.125 --> 35:34.709
He can't hurt you.

35:34.792 --> 35:36.417
No, you got it wrong!

35:36.500 --> 35:39.458
(Miller)
'You put yourself at
the scene, Biggie.'

35:39.542 --> 35:41.709
- Said she was "good to go"
- 'Mia was dead.'

35:41.792 --> 35:44.375
You got Lester to stuff her
into silks just to cover it
up.

35:44.458 --> 35:48.041
I'd done some things
I had to do.

35:48.125 --> 35:51.166
But I did not kill Mia.

35:54.166 --> 35:55.750
'If you could please find it
in
your heart to donate again'

35:55.834 --> 35:57.125
'to help orphaned
children get a chance'

35:57.208 --> 35:58.917
to see the human butterfly

35:59.000 --> 36:00.875
(male #1)
'In return, for helping make
these children's dreams'

36:00.959 --> 36:02.709
come true, your company
name will be featured

36:02.792 --> 36:04.417
in our special program.

36:04.500 --> 36:06.875
(Biggie)
'Hey, Mia.'

36:06.959 --> 36:09.166
- What are you doing here?
- This makes no sense.

36:09.250 --> 36:11.583
It says we've sold 800
tickets.
The top only sits 400.

36:11.667 --> 36:13.417
- What are you doing, Biggie?
- Alright, everyone.

36:13.500 --> 36:15.500
Scram.

36:16.625 --> 36:18.375
Listen, sweetheart

36:18.458 --> 36:21.083
to make sure that
the show can go on

36:21.166 --> 36:22.417
I've had to be a
little creative.

36:22.500 --> 36:24.083
We're not affiliated
with any charity

36:24.166 --> 36:26.208
but you're selling
tickets in their name.

36:26.291 --> 36:27.917
Where were these
kids in the stands?

36:28.000 --> 36:29.250
It's a write-off
to local
businesses.

36:29.333 --> 36:31.417
It's one thing to rip
people off on the midway

36:31.500 --> 36:34.250
but you're going to use my act
to scam charities for orphans?

36:34.333 --> 36:35.625
What do you care?

36:35.709 --> 36:39.000
You'll be flying under
the Ringling top soon.

36:39.083 --> 36:40.417
- What?
- 'That's right.'

36:40.500 --> 36:42.458
I know all about it.

36:44.333 --> 36:47.125
I can't believe you, Biggie.

36:47.208 --> 36:49.875
I was going to tell
them "no." But now?

37:00.959 --> 37:02.542
Once I told management

37:02.625 --> 37:04.291
it was out of my hands.

37:04.375 --> 37:05.458
"Management," huh?

37:05.542 --> 37:06.792
Controlled the whole thing.

37:06.875 --> 37:09.792
And just who was
this management?

37:09.875 --> 37:13.041
- Bunch of suits out of
Florida.
- You see, that's a crock.

37:13.125 --> 37:14.709
The SEC has no record

37:14.792 --> 37:16.959
of J.B. Ricketts investments.

37:17.041 --> 37:18.417
But Wikipedia does.

37:18.500 --> 37:22.792
J.B. Ricketts founded
The American circus.

37:22.875 --> 37:25.458
Died in 1799.

37:25.542 --> 37:27.083
There was no
"management." It was you.

37:27.166 --> 37:28.500
No.

37:30.041 --> 37:34.000
If it were just that simple.

37:34.083 --> 37:36.208
You were diagnosed with, uh

37:36.291 --> 37:39.709
is it "cerebral gigantism"?

37:39.792 --> 37:41.667
It's a pretty rare disorder.

37:41.750 --> 37:43.792
Often accompanied
with diminished

37:43.875 --> 37:45.500
mental capacity.

37:45.583 --> 37:47.208
The D.A.'s willing
to cut a deal for
you.

37:47.291 --> 37:49.333
We don't want to send you
to
county, so you tell us

37:49.417 --> 37:51.041
what happened and
we'll make sure you
go

37:51.125 --> 37:52.917
to a comfortable
medical facility.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.709
(Valens)
'Oh, yeah, they'll get
you squared away.'

37:54.792 --> 37:58.750
In a year or two, you're
a handyman and ready again.

38:00.750 --> 38:02.792
Help us put Biggie
away for good.

38:12.667 --> 38:16.500
Biggie was a...a monster.

38:21.125 --> 38:23.000
He...he...he made me.

38:26.375 --> 38:29.750
This lifeline, those
meds
pretty expensive.

38:29.834 --> 38:32.166
I didn't know the circus
had such great benefits.

38:32.250 --> 38:34.041
(Miller)
'So, we decided to check.'

38:34.125 --> 38:35.500
Turns out they don't.

38:35.583 --> 38:37.750
Your medicine is paid for
by a private company.

38:37.834 --> 38:40.000
Same company pays your rent.

38:40.083 --> 38:42.041
- You don't get it, do you?
- No, I get it.

38:42.125 --> 38:44.625
And you're going to prison,
and
there's no PPO in the pokie.

38:44.709 --> 38:47.709
A guy like you
won't last six months.

38:49.625 --> 38:50.750
(Vera)
'Last time, Big.'

38:50.834 --> 38:52.417
Who was management?

38:59.125 --> 39:00.750
[mockingly]
"He made me."

39:00.834 --> 39:02.625
(Valens)
'Man, I hope we got
that on video.'

39:02.709 --> 39:04.333
'Submit it to the academy.'

39:04.417 --> 39:05.417
(Rush)
'See, the thing is'

39:05.500 --> 39:07.375
people with cerebral gigantism

39:07.458 --> 39:09.000
although usually
bigger as
children

39:09.083 --> 39:11.375
are often in the normal
height range as adults.

39:11.458 --> 39:13.208
Far from normal,
Gargantuan.

39:13.291 --> 39:15.500
(Rush)
'That country doctor
misdiagnosed you.'

39:15.583 --> 39:17.250
'You don't have
cerebral gigantism.'

39:17.333 --> 39:19.750
- You're just big.
- No, but you ain't no
dummy.

39:19.834 --> 39:21.542
See, I wanted
to talk to your boss.

39:21.625 --> 39:22.834
Went to the city tax assessors

39:22.917 --> 39:24.583
to see who owns that
building you maintain.

39:24.667 --> 39:26.333
Found out, it's
you.
You own it.

39:26.417 --> 39:28.250
(Valens)
'Along with half
a dozen others.'

39:28.333 --> 39:29.750
Big top, incorporated.

39:29.834 --> 39:31.834
(Rush)
'Same company that
pays Biggie's bill.'

39:31.917 --> 39:33.792
You were "management."

39:35.417 --> 39:37.417
Me?

39:39.625 --> 39:40.917
Biggie's confession.

39:41.000 --> 39:42.667
I'd give it to you
in picture form

39:42.750 --> 39:45.542
but we know you weren't
hit with the idiot stick.

39:45.625 --> 39:48.959
In fact, you're a millionaire.

39:51.375 --> 39:53.458
(Rush)
'Now, Biggie told us how
his circus was dying'

39:53.542 --> 39:56.291
till you took it over.
You weren't his puppet.

39:56.375 --> 39:57.834
He was yours.

40:04.500 --> 40:06.000
Seen that fear
in your eyes

40:06.083 --> 40:07.709
all my life.

40:07.792 --> 40:11.375
But when those cake eaters
would step into ten-in-one

40:11.458 --> 40:12.792
looking at me.

40:12.875 --> 40:15.458
Laughing.

40:15.542 --> 40:16.834
Pointing.

40:16.917 --> 40:18.959
They thought I was on exhibit.

40:20.750 --> 40:23.041
But I was studying them.

40:23.125 --> 40:26.291
So you concocted a scam
to get back at them.

40:26.375 --> 40:28.458
- Steal their money.
- Prove you were smarter.

40:28.542 --> 40:31.333
No. It was about
preserving our family.

40:31.417 --> 40:32.709
Our livelihoods.

40:32.792 --> 40:36.000
The one place where no one
would treat me like a freak.

40:36.083 --> 40:38.333
But Mia busted you on your scam.

40:38.417 --> 40:39.750
Wouldn't take part.

40:39.834 --> 40:41.000
We could've moved on.

40:41.083 --> 40:42.875
Gone back to the family we were.

40:42.959 --> 40:45.625
I couldn't just...sit by

40:45.709 --> 40:48.375
and have her tear us apart.

40:52.083 --> 40:54.542
(Biggie)
'Wanted to wish you
a good show, kid.'

40:56.166 --> 40:58.291
But Mia, what you saw

40:58.375 --> 41:01.291
'those phone calls, will
never happen again, Mia.'

41:01.375 --> 41:03.667
(Biggie)
'We'll sell out
with your act and some'

41:03.750 --> 41:06.041
old-fashioned bally.

41:06.125 --> 41:07.375
Family again.

41:07.458 --> 41:10.250
(Biggie)
'No blood, no foul.'

41:10.333 --> 41:12.875
You expect me to
trust
you? You're a con.

41:12.959 --> 41:14.166
Mia, listen--

41:14.250 --> 41:15.583
You know what
a con man hates most?

41:15.667 --> 41:17.041
People knowing the truth.

41:18.500 --> 41:19.542
Look, there's no need

41:19.625 --> 41:20.917
to get the cops involved.

41:21.000 --> 41:22.500
I'm a kinker. No cops.

41:22.583 --> 41:25.709
After the show, I'm
telling the family the
truth.

41:25.792 --> 41:28.083
Mia! Don't be a fool.

41:28.166 --> 41:29.917
Let them make their
own
decisions, Biggie.

41:30.834 --> 41:33.041
I've already made mine.

41:33.125 --> 41:35.000
Now, I gotta fly.
