to go to a dog show.

09:40.997 --> 09:43.875
I mean, a man who loves

09:40.997 --> 09:43.875
dogs as much as me

09:43.917 --> 09:46.586
that would just

09:43.917 --> 09:46.586
about make my day.

09:46.627 --> 09:48.588
Would you like

09:46.627 --> 09:48.588
to go to the dog show?

09:48.629 --> 09:50.924
Oh, if you insist.

09:52.509 --> 09:55.554
Oh, great. Do we need to get

09:52.509 --> 09:55.554
permission for you to leave?

09:55.595 --> 09:58.932
What you think I gotta ask

09:55.595 --> 09:58.932
to, just to get out this door?

09:58.973 --> 10:02.143
I've done whatever

09:58.973 --> 10:02.143
I want all my life

10:02.185 --> 10:05.355
except for those

10:02.185 --> 10:05.355
41 years I was married.

10:06.647 --> 10:08.858
- Great. Let's go.

10:06.647 --> 10:08.858
- Okay..

10:10.944 --> 10:13.988
Let me just tell my friend

10:10.944 --> 10:13.988
I'm steppin' out.

10:15.615 --> 10:18.701
Hey, I'm gettin'

10:15.615 --> 10:18.701
out of here, you old goat.

10:18.743 --> 10:20.412
I'm going to a dog show.

10:20.454 --> 10:23.748
That little girl isn't allowed

10:20.454 --> 10:23.748
to take you out of here.

10:23.790 --> 10:25.875
What if you have

10:23.790 --> 10:25.875
one of your spells out there?

10:25.917 --> 10:28.211
I'm not gonna have

10:25.917 --> 10:28.211
any of my spells.

10:28.253 --> 10:30.838
Now, just, here.

10:28.253 --> 10:30.838
Hold on to this candy bar.

10:32.132 --> 10:34.759
- I'm not allowed to eat candy.

10:32.132 --> 10:34.759
- I know that.

10:34.801 --> 10:36.886
Just hold on to it.

10:39.222 --> 10:42.642
Uh, nurse, Ferguson's over there

10:39.222 --> 10:42.642
trying to sneak a candy bar.

10:42.683 --> 10:43.935
Go on over there and nail him.

10:43.977 --> 10:46.271
Mr. Ferguson.

10:47.939 --> 10:50.650
- Shall we?

10:47.939 --> 10:50.650
- I'd be delighted.

10:56.739 --> 11:00.034
Follow me, Eddie.

10:56.739 --> 11:00.034
The dog show's in the backyard.

11:06.416 --> 11:09.419
Eddie, this is my Uncle Jesse.

11:09.461 --> 11:10.587
How you doin', Eddie?

11:10.629 --> 11:13.214
Oh, boy, a pregnant man.

11:14.882 --> 11:18.303
I gotta get out more often.

11:18.345 --> 11:20.555
No, no, no. No, see, Eddie,

11:18.345 --> 11:20.555
I'm not really pregnant, see.

11:20.597 --> 11:23.433
I'm, uh, I-I have this bet

11:20.597 --> 11:23.433
with my-my pregnant wife

11:23.475 --> 11:25.352
that she bet, I can't

11:23.475 --> 11:25.352
wear this for 24 hours.

11:25.393 --> 11:27.145
Let me tell you something

11:25.393 --> 11:27.145
it's almost been two hours

11:27.187 --> 11:28.647
and I feel great.

11:28.687 --> 11:30.190
Except of course,

11:28.687 --> 11:30.190
my-my back hurts

11:30.231 --> 11:32.066
my ankles are

11:30.231 --> 11:32.066
beginning to swell

11:32.108 --> 11:35.570
and I think

11:32.108 --> 11:35.570
I'm retaining water.

11:38.198 --> 11:40.783
[laughing]

11:42.369 --> 11:44.078
Oh, good, Deej,

11:42.369 --> 11:44.078
you're here.

11:44.120 --> 11:45.872
We're ready

11:44.120 --> 11:45.872
to start the dog show.

11:45.913 --> 11:47.374
Eddie, this is Joey.

11:47.415 --> 11:50.377
Well, Joey, what branch

11:47.415 --> 11:50.377
of the service are you in?

11:50.418 --> 11:53.921
Actually, I'm Ranger Joe

11:50.418 --> 11:53.921
from the Enchanted Forest.

11:55.674 --> 11:58.385
Hey, let's just

11:55.674 --> 11:58.385
get goin', huh?

11:59.469 --> 12:02.305
You do have

11:59.469 --> 12:02.305
that special glow.

12:05.724 --> 12:09.020
Hey, Eddie, you can help me

12:05.724 --> 12:09.020
judge the dog show.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.026
Eddie, are you coming?

12:15.068 --> 12:17.153
What? Oh, yeah.

12:17.195 --> 12:19.072
Come on, Gloria,

12:17.195 --> 12:19.072
you got to hurry.

12:19.113 --> 12:21.908
You're gonna be

12:19.113 --> 12:21.908
late for school.

12:21.949 --> 12:24.035
What are you

12:21.949 --> 12:24.035
talking about?

12:24.077 --> 12:25.704
Huh?

12:25.744 --> 12:28.415
Well, you just

12:25.744 --> 12:28.415
called me Gloria. I'm D.J.

12:29.748 --> 12:33.211
Hey...I know who you are.

12:33.253 --> 12:37.382
Come on, D.J., we got

12:33.253 --> 12:37.382
to get to that dog show.

12:46.933 --> 12:48.767
- 'Hi.'

12:46.933 --> 12:48.767
- Hey.

12:48.809 --> 12:53.231
Well, I picked up

12:48.809 --> 12:53.231
first prize for the dog show.

12:53.273 --> 12:54.566
A pooper scooper.

12:56.276 --> 12:58.027
So, uh, how's your bet

12:56.276 --> 12:58.027
with Becky coming?

12:58.069 --> 12:59.279
It's going good.

12:59.320 --> 13:00.405
Just gonna take

12:59.320 --> 13:00.405
this off a while

13:00.447 --> 13:02.616
because my back is

13:00.447 --> 13:02.616
killing me.

13:02.657 --> 13:05.118
Yeah, but, Jess,

13:02.657 --> 13:05.118
that would be cheating.

13:05.159 --> 13:07.828
Don't be such

13:05.159 --> 13:07.828
a goody-goody.

13:07.870 --> 13:09.289
I'm not cheating

13:07.870 --> 13:09.289
because of me.

13:09.330 --> 13:10.873
I'm doing it for guys

13:09.330 --> 13:10.873
across the whole country

13:10.915 --> 13:13.627
who shoot off their mouths

13:10.915 --> 13:13.627
and have to suffer for it.

13:13.668 --> 13:15.169
Here, you-you watch

13:13.668 --> 13:15.169
the kitchen door.

13:15.211 --> 13:18.548
- I'll watch the front door.

13:15.211 --> 13:18.548
- Got you.

13:18.590 --> 13:21.301
You know, I know us men are

13:18.590 --> 13:21.301
cheated out of experiencing

13:21.342 --> 13:25.472
the miracle of birth,

13:21.342 --> 13:25.472
but...who cares?

13:25.513 --> 13:27.848
Ohh.

13:27.890 --> 13:29.934
I bet I could take the weights

13:27.890 --> 13:29.934
out of that and put feathers in

13:29.976 --> 13:32.811
Becky would never

13:29.976 --> 13:32.811
know the difference.

13:32.853 --> 13:35.273
Ah, my neck is killing me.

13:37.358 --> 13:38.735
Thanks, Danny.

13:43.030 --> 13:45.450
Ah, can you get my back?

13:45.492 --> 13:47.619
Hey, who's watching

13:45.492 --> 13:47.619
the kitchen door?

13:47.661 --> 13:48.995
I am.

13:50.955 --> 13:53.207
- Then who's--

13:50.955 --> 13:53.207
- Take a wild guess.

13:55.960 --> 13:57.754
Hi, Beck.

13:57.796 --> 13:58.837
Thanks a lot.

13:58.879 --> 14:00.590
She didn't come

13:58.879 --> 14:00.590
through my door.

14:00.632 --> 14:02.425
Beck, I'm sorry. I just-I just

14:00.632 --> 14:02.425
taking a little break.

14:02.467 --> 14:04.803
Here look I'm strapping

14:02.467 --> 14:04.803
this puppy right back on.

14:04.843 --> 14:06.929
Oh, no, no, no.

14:06.971 --> 14:08.807
That's not how it works,

14:06.971 --> 14:08.807
buddy boy.

14:08.847 --> 14:12.226
I can't unstrap this puppy.

14:12.268 --> 14:13.728
You lost.

14:13.770 --> 14:15.647
I get to pick the wallpaper.

14:15.689 --> 14:18.483
Fun at the circus.

14:18.525 --> 14:21.068
That nursery is gonna

14:18.525 --> 14:21.068
be full of clowns

14:21.110 --> 14:22.945
all laughing at you.

14:25.114 --> 14:26.949
Alright, alright. You win.

14:28.493 --> 14:30.203
I admit it, you babes

14:28.493 --> 14:30.203
are pretty tough

14:30.244 --> 14:32.413
to carry that around

14:30.244 --> 14:32.413
for nine months.

14:32.455 --> 14:35.124
Aw, well, I know

14:32.455 --> 14:35.124
I complain sometimes

14:35.166 --> 14:38.127
but the truth is,

14:35.166 --> 14:38.127
it's worth it.

14:38.169 --> 14:40.171
Carrying our twins

14:38.169 --> 14:40.171
has been..

14:40.213 --> 14:43.007
...the most wonderful

14:40.213 --> 14:43.007
experience of my life.

14:43.049 --> 14:44.718
You're incredible.

14:49.180 --> 14:52.517
How does a total

14:49.180 --> 14:52.517
body massage sound?

14:52.559 --> 14:54.227
Oh, like heaven.

14:54.268 --> 14:56.563
Good, 'cause I could

14:54.268 --> 14:56.563
really use one.

Okay, guys,

15:03.820 --> 15:06.030
when we win first place

15:06.072 --> 15:08.783
there will be something

15:06.072 --> 15:08.783
extra in each of your bowls.

15:08.825 --> 15:12.286
It better not

15:08.825 --> 15:12.286
be dog food.

15:12.328 --> 15:13.747
Okay, next up.

15:13.788 --> 15:15.998
You've seen him at all

15:13.788 --> 15:15.998
the local fire hydrants.

15:16.040 --> 15:17.917
You've even chased him

15:16.040 --> 15:17.917
off your own lawn.

15:17.958 --> 15:19.586
Now, here he is in person.

15:19.627 --> 15:21.962
Give it up for Sparky!

15:27.051 --> 15:30.054
his funny walk.

15:36.269 --> 15:37.854
I give him four stars.

15:37.896 --> 15:41.232
That little wiener Sparky

15:37.896 --> 15:41.232
is going to be tough to beat.

are in love.

18:01.288 --> 18:04.709
without being signed out

18:01.288 --> 18:04.709
by a family member.

18:04.751 --> 18:07.045
He never told me that.

18:07.086 --> 18:09.213
Where is Eddie?

18:09.255 --> 18:10.798
He was here a minute ago.

18:10.840 --> 18:13.384
He's probably in the house.

18:15.135 --> 18:17.805
- Is Eddie okay?

18:15.135 --> 18:17.805
- I'm afraid not.

18:18.932 --> 18:20.224
Come on.

18:24.311 --> 18:26.355
Eddie?

18:26.397 --> 18:28.024
Here you are.

18:28.066 --> 18:32.319
You cleaned up your room

18:28.066 --> 18:32.319
real nice, Gloria.

18:32.361 --> 18:34.030
Gloria?

18:34.072 --> 18:35.907
You're doing it again.

18:35.949 --> 18:39.535
Now, you be nice or I'm going

18:35.949 --> 18:39.535
to let you watch "Howdy Doody."

18:40.787 --> 18:42.329
"Howdy Doody?"

18:42.371 --> 18:44.749
That was on before I was born.

18:44.791 --> 18:47.167
Eddie, why are

18:44.791 --> 18:47.167
you doing this?

18:47.209 --> 18:49.045
Doing what?

18:49.087 --> 18:50.379
You just called me Gloria

18:50.421 --> 18:52.256
and said I couldn't

18:50.421 --> 18:52.256
watch "Howdy Doody."

18:52.298 --> 18:57.971
I did? Oh, I was just

18:52.298 --> 18:57.971
playing around, D.J.

18:58.012 --> 19:00.807
Eddie, there's a nurse here

18:58.012 --> 19:00.807
looking for you

19:00.848 --> 19:03.101
and I think

19:00.848 --> 19:03.101
we're both in trouble.

19:03.142 --> 19:06.062
Why didn't you tell me

19:03.142 --> 19:06.062
you weren't supposed to leave?

19:06.104 --> 19:08.272
So I snuck out

19:06.104 --> 19:08.272
and had a good time.

19:08.314 --> 19:10.566
Now, what's the big deal?

19:10.608 --> 19:13.945
The big deal is you're not

19:10.608 --> 19:13.945
allowed out without permission.

19:13.987 --> 19:17.490
Come on, D.J.,

19:13.987 --> 19:17.490
you worry too much.

19:17.531 --> 19:20.660
- Everything's fine.

19:17.531 --> 19:20.660
- Everything's not fine.

19:21.619 --> 19:22.954
I want to be your friend

19:22.996 --> 19:25.790
but friends need to tell

19:22.996 --> 19:25.790
each other the truth.

19:28.417 --> 19:31.004
You want the truth?

19:35.091 --> 19:38.594
Most of the time, I'm fine

19:38.636 --> 19:41.055
but every now

19:38.636 --> 19:41.055
and then they say that

19:41.097 --> 19:43.808
my mind sort of drifts off.

19:45.059 --> 19:48.896
But...I always

19:45.059 --> 19:48.896
find my way back.

19:50.356 --> 19:52.025
Are you gonna be alright?

19:52.066 --> 19:56.612
Hey, come on,

19:52.066 --> 19:56.612
Eddie Johnson's a fighter.

19:59.532 --> 20:01.200
He's in here.

20:01.241 --> 20:04.912
- Eddie, not good.

20:01.241 --> 20:04.912
- Don't shoot.

20:04.954 --> 20:08.457
I'll go peacefully.

20:08.499 --> 20:09.917
Hey.

20:09.959 --> 20:13.754
I'm really sorry

20:09.959 --> 20:13.754
if I caused you all this trouble

20:13.796 --> 20:17.925
and if you don't come

20:13.796 --> 20:17.925
to visit me anymore..

20:17.967 --> 20:19.969
...I'll understand.

20:20.011 --> 20:21.554
But I got to tell you

20:21.595 --> 20:23.514
this has been one

20:21.595 --> 20:23.514
of the best days

20:23.556 --> 20:27.185
I've had in a long time.

20:27.226 --> 20:29.478
I had a great time, too.

20:31.480 --> 20:33.607
Okay, let's go back.

20:34.734 --> 20:36.069
Bye.

20:38.863 --> 20:41.115
Dad..

20:41.157 --> 20:45.411
...I was talking to Eddie

20:41.157 --> 20:45.411
and he didn't know who I was.

20:45.452 --> 20:47.830
Oh, sweetheart, the nurse told

20:45.452 --> 20:47.830
me that Eddie is showing

20:47.872 --> 20:51.417
the early signs

20:47.872 --> 20:51.417
of Alzheimer's disease.

20:51.458 --> 20:54.336
It affects his memory

20:51.458 --> 20:54.336
and sometimes he doesn't know

20:54.378 --> 20:57.215
where he is or what he's doing.

20:57.256 --> 20:58.674
Is he gonna get better?

21:00.384 --> 21:02.178
Well, the truth is, uh

21:02.220 --> 21:05.181
if he has Alzheimer's,

21:02.220 --> 21:05.181
he's gonna get worse.

21:05.223 --> 21:07.225
And there's no cure?

21:07.266 --> 21:08.559
Not yet.

21:10.310 --> 21:12.730
I can't believe this.

21:12.772 --> 21:15.691
I really liked Eddie.

21:15.733 --> 21:17.860
What am I supposed to do,

21:15.733 --> 21:17.860
just keep going back there

21:17.902 --> 21:21.072
and watch him

21:17.902 --> 21:21.072
get worse and worse?

21:21.114 --> 21:22.782
I know. I know.

21:22.823 --> 21:26.285
This is not

21:22.823 --> 21:26.285
an easy thing to do.

21:26.326 --> 21:28.913
Why did I become a volunteer?

21:30.164 --> 21:31.457
Why did you?

21:33.084 --> 21:35.335
Well, 'cause

21:33.084 --> 21:35.335
I wanted to help people.

21:35.377 --> 21:37.880
Well, I think you know

21:35.377 --> 21:37.880
the best way to help somebody

21:37.922 --> 21:41.134
is by being

21:37.922 --> 21:41.134
their friend.

21:41.175 --> 21:45.304
Did you see Eddie

21:41.175 --> 21:45.304
at the dog show laughing today?

21:45.345 --> 21:47.056
He just said today was

21:45.345 --> 21:47.056
one of his best days

21:47.098 --> 21:48.933
he's had in a long time.

21:48.975 --> 21:51.560
That's all thanks

21:48.975 --> 21:51.560
to you, Deej.

21:51.602 --> 21:54.272
You can do a lot

21:51.602 --> 21:54.272
for him just by..

21:54.313 --> 21:56.232
...brightening up his day and..

21:56.274 --> 21:58.651
...giving him something

21:56.274 --> 21:58.651
to look forward to.

22:01.487 --> 22:02.905
I'll be right back, dad.

22:04.865 --> 22:08.202
We gotta start taking

22:04.865 --> 22:08.202
field trips to this house.

22:08.244 --> 22:10.163
In one afternoon

22:10.204 --> 22:13.958
I saw a dog show,

22:10.204 --> 22:13.958
a man in a ranger suit

22:14.000 --> 22:16.627
and a pregnant man.

22:16.669 --> 22:19.255
Eddie, you need a nap.

22:19.922 --> 22:21.799
Eddie, wait.

22:21.841 --> 22:24.010
Um, I wanted

22:21.841 --> 22:24.010
to ask you something.

22:25.845 --> 22:29.098
Would you stay for dinner

22:25.845 --> 22:29.098
with me and my family?

22:29.140 --> 22:30.850
Actually, we'd love

22:29.140 --> 22:30.850
to have you both.

22:30.891 --> 22:33.936
Well, I need

22:30.891 --> 22:33.936
to get back to work

22:33.978 --> 22:35.729
but Eddie can stay

22:33.978 --> 22:35.729
if he wants.

22:35.771 --> 22:38.858
I couldn't impose

22:38.899 --> 22:41.777
but just out of curiosity,

22:38.899 --> 22:41.777
what are you having?

22:41.819 --> 22:44.613
- Lasagna.

22:41.819 --> 22:44.613
- I'll impose for lasagna.

22:44.655 --> 22:48.034
- Goodbye. Behave.

22:44.655 --> 22:48.034
- Bye-bye.

22:48.075 --> 22:50.410
Would you like

22:48.075 --> 22:50.410
to help me set the table?

22:50.452 --> 22:52.163
I'd be delighted.
