300MB UNiTED TEAM - sunmenghao

01:46.607 --> 01:48.024
Who are you?

01:48.817 --> 01:50.610
What are you doing?

01:50.694 --> 01:53.196
There's a golf links going in here.

01:54.198 --> 01:55.698
What's golf?

01:56.658 --> 01:59.202
Golf is a game played by gentlemen.

01:59.578 --> 02:01.329
Not for the likes of you.

02:01.413 --> 02:04.207
Now, run along, boy.

05:09.685 --> 05:11.310
Here it is, sir.

06:03.655 --> 06:05.489
Come on, boy! Let's go!

06:48.784 --> 06:51.827
That's it. Sit up straight, Sarah.

06:51.912 --> 06:54.830
Lightly on the reins. There.

07:03.090 --> 07:05.591
This is how we do it, Francis.

07:05.675 --> 07:08.552
We work hard,
and we bring home the money.

07:14.559 --> 07:17.186
Work hard. Bring home the money.

07:51.179 --> 07:52.930
-Guillermo!
-Yes, sir!

07:53.014 --> 07:54.390
Come on!

08:42.355 --> 08:45.232
Francis, what in the world
are you doing?

08:47.110 --> 08:48.944
It's after midnight!

08:50.113 --> 08:52.990
You're keeping your brother up.
Go to bed.

08:54.492 --> 08:56.368
Raymond, go to sleep.

08:56.620 --> 08:57.828
No talking.

08:57.913 --> 08:59.955
No noises. I mean it.

09:05.712 --> 09:08.255
What have you got there, Francis?

09:10.050 --> 09:11.342
Francis.

09:13.970 --> 09:16.305
Can I see him, Father? Please?

09:16.723 --> 09:19.058
What's he talking about? See who?

09:19.142 --> 09:20.601
Harry Vardon.

09:26.775 --> 09:29.109
Any gentleman who plays this game

09:29.194 --> 09:31.278
is not a friend to you.

09:31.363 --> 09:32.613
I know.

09:32.989 --> 09:35.115
But he's the greatest ever.

09:35.784 --> 09:39.078
-Arthur, I don't see the harm...
-Not another word.

09:40.330 --> 09:42.623
The boy goes to school today.

09:42.707 --> 09:44.500
That's the end of it.

09:51.675 --> 09:53.676
Mrs. Darcy, mind the little one!

09:53.760 --> 09:56.095
He'll try to climb those stairs.

09:56.388 --> 09:58.514
Francis, leave your books.

09:59.140 --> 10:02.268
I've got shopping to do.
You come with me now.

10:02.352 --> 10:04.436
But Father said I had to go to school...

10:04.521 --> 10:07.690
You can miss school for one day.
I need help with me packages.

10:07.774 --> 10:09.275
Come along.

10:30.547 --> 10:33.090
What could be causing such a fuss?

10:35.385 --> 10:37.219
Go on. I'll find ya.

11:17.260 --> 11:18.427
Thank you very much.

11:18.511 --> 11:20.637
I'll now presume upon your goodwill

11:20.722 --> 11:23.599
and request the services of a volunteer.

11:24.100 --> 11:25.351
Anyone?

11:34.778 --> 11:36.779
Hello. What's your name?

11:37.072 --> 11:39.323
-Francis.
-Hello, Mr. Francis.

11:41.451 --> 11:43.952
Now, do you know what this is?

11:45.205 --> 11:46.622
A brassie.

11:47.499 --> 11:49.708
So it is. Have a bash.

12:08.812 --> 12:10.521
That's all right, Francis.

12:10.605 --> 12:11.897
Even in our darkest hour,

12:11.981 --> 12:15.067
we must always remember,
you never despair.

12:15.151 --> 12:17.945
Have you held
a live bird in your hands?

12:18.363 --> 12:20.406
Not too hard to hurt her.

12:21.324 --> 12:24.326
Just firm enough
to stop it from flying away.

12:26.413 --> 12:27.955
Try it again.

12:39.717 --> 12:41.468
Did you see that?

13:08.496 --> 13:10.539
Hail the conquering hero!

13:11.082 --> 13:12.583
Mr. Darwin.

13:14.377 --> 13:17.087
-Is this what I think it is?
-I'm not sure, Harry.

13:17.172 --> 13:19.298
I received a summons
from Lord Northcliffe,

13:19.382 --> 13:21.425
-just as you did.
-Keep the change, mate.

13:21.509 --> 13:24.178
-He's waiting inside.
-Today's the day.

13:24.721 --> 13:27.848
But, Harry, no professional
has ever been asked

13:27.932 --> 13:30.517
to join a gentlemen's
golf club as a member.

13:30.602 --> 13:32.561
-First time for everything, Bernard.
-Yes.

13:32.645 --> 13:35.481
Look at this place.
Why else would they want you here?

13:35.565 --> 13:38.734
He doesn't confide in me.
I only work for him.

13:41.154 --> 13:44.156
Ten years ago, I was clipping hedges.

13:51.998 --> 13:53.415
Marvelous.

13:55.585 --> 13:57.711
Brilliantly done, Harry.

13:58.922 --> 14:00.506
Thank you, sir.

14:02.091 --> 14:04.259
I'd be honored
if you'd consider adding it

14:04.344 --> 14:06.970
-to your trophy case.
-A glittering addition.

14:07.055 --> 14:10.724
We'd be pleased to keep it for you.
Wouldn't we, Neville?

14:10.808 --> 14:12.142
Handsome.

14:12.435 --> 14:15.562
But you might not
get it back without a tussle.

14:15.980 --> 14:18.774
Don't plan on handing it back
myself without a fight.

14:18.858 --> 14:21.401
Harry, I'll come right to the point.

14:21.486 --> 14:23.278
We've had an opening at our club.

14:23.363 --> 14:26.365
Lord Bullock chairs
the membership committee.

14:27.575 --> 14:29.618
What does your father do?

14:30.078 --> 14:33.705
-He's a gardener on Jersey, sir.
-I'm told you're Church of Rome.

14:33.790 --> 14:35.958
-Mother's French?
-Yes, sir.

14:36.459 --> 14:39.211
I believe we can work around it.

14:42.090 --> 14:45.175
It's decided, then.
You're just the man for us.

14:53.226 --> 14:55.727
Well, I don't know what to say, sir.

14:56.646 --> 14:58.897
Well, say yes.
We want you to work for us.

14:58.982 --> 15:00.065
Decent wage.

15:00.149 --> 15:03.151
You can run your own shop.
Lessons, of course.

15:03.653 --> 15:05.237
Charge what you like for those.

15:05.321 --> 15:07.990
You're the only man in England
who can set me right.

15:08.074 --> 15:12.160
You'll have your work cut out.
I think it's drinks all around.

15:12.245 --> 15:14.913
Yes, I'm told you'll work for us...

15:14.998 --> 15:16.748
Golf is a game played by gentlemen.

15:16.833 --> 15:19.376
Not for the likes of you.
Played by gentlemen.

15:19.460 --> 15:21.587
Run your own shop. Decent wage.

15:21.671 --> 15:22.713
Run along, boy.

15:45.194 --> 15:47.946
Francis. It's after midnight.

15:48.573 --> 15:50.532
Just one more, Mother.

16:18.728 --> 16:20.312
Mr. Hastings!

16:21.397 --> 16:23.231
-Master Francis.
-Sir.

16:24.233 --> 16:25.692
We now lack but one essential

16:25.777 --> 16:28.320
to complete the swift
appointment of our round.

16:28.404 --> 16:29.780
Your clubs.

16:29.864 --> 16:33.408
My clubs, sir?
Caddies aren't allowed on the course.

16:33.493 --> 16:36.703
-If Mr. Campbell sees me...
-Let me worry about Campbell.

16:36.788 --> 16:38.622
Go. Get those clubs.

16:39.123 --> 16:41.208
You go, boy. Get those clubs.

16:41.584 --> 16:43.418
Hup, hup, hup, hup!

17:00.853 --> 17:02.521
-Well struck, lad.
-Thank you, sir.

17:57.034 --> 17:59.035
What did you shoot?

18:00.288 --> 18:02.914
-An 81, sir.
-What did you take on 15?

18:03.583 --> 18:04.708
A nine, sir.

18:04.792 --> 18:06.918
So you shot an 81 the first time around

18:07.003 --> 18:09.880
on the toughest golf course
in New England?

18:09.964 --> 18:12.507
-With a nine?
-Well, I think I...

18:13.342 --> 18:16.970
I saw you there, knowing that
caddies aren't supposed to play...

18:17.054 --> 18:18.305
Go on.

18:19.182 --> 18:22.058
I think I got a little nervous, sir.

18:22.143 --> 18:25.020
We needed to see
how you handled yourself.

18:25.521 --> 18:26.772
Handled myself?

18:26.856 --> 18:30.108
National Amateur Championship's
here next month.

18:33.863 --> 18:36.156
Are you saying that I can...

18:36.240 --> 18:37.574
What do I have to do? I'll do anything.

18:37.658 --> 18:40.744
-Play in the qualifier.
-That's the easy part.

18:40.828 --> 18:43.163
First, you have to be approved
by the executive committee.

18:44.874 --> 18:46.416
You're a caddie here?

18:46.501 --> 18:48.543
Yes, sir. For ten years.

18:48.795 --> 18:51.254
I recently resigned to preserve
my status as an amateur.

18:51.339 --> 18:54.007
What, no plans to turn professional?

18:54.634 --> 18:56.968
No, sir.
I plan to have a career in business.

18:57.053 --> 18:59.638
-Oh, business?
-Yes.

19:00.056 --> 19:01.181
What sort of business?

19:01.265 --> 19:02.974
Howard, we need...

19:03.726 --> 19:05.560
Sorry. Carry on.

19:05.645 --> 19:08.230
What's your home club?
I don't see it here.

19:08.314 --> 19:10.482
They have to sponsor you.

19:10.566 --> 19:12.150
My home club?

19:14.111 --> 19:15.737
I'm between clubs.

19:15.822 --> 19:17.572
Look, see here.

19:17.657 --> 19:19.324
You may have qualified as a player,

19:19.408 --> 19:23.036
but this just isn't
the sort of thing that caddies do.

19:23.746 --> 19:26.414
-You're a caddie?
-Yes, sir, I was.

19:26.916 --> 19:30.085
Caddies don't play in the Amateur.
It's not for your kind.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.878
Members only.

19:31.963 --> 19:34.840
We need to discuss the opening
on the greens committee.

19:34.924 --> 19:36.049
I'm sorry.

19:36.133 --> 19:39.553
There must be a way for somebody
who's not a member to compete.

19:39.637 --> 19:41.179
Not this year.

19:46.394 --> 19:49.479
As if he could afford
the $50 entrance fee.

19:51.732 --> 19:53.400
Excuse me. Sir...

19:54.694 --> 19:57.529
If I were to pay the $50,
would I still need to belong to a club?

19:57.613 --> 19:59.364
Technically, no.

20:03.286 --> 20:06.454
You would still need a club member
in good standing to sponsor you, and...

20:06.539 --> 20:09.624
And...that would be me.

20:12.003 --> 20:14.129
Fifty dollars to play golf.

20:14.213 --> 20:16.089
I'll pay back every penny
from my earnings.

20:16.173 --> 20:19.384
Is this how I failed you?
Is that all you've learned from me?

20:19.468 --> 20:21.678
No, sir. But it's just a game.

20:21.762 --> 20:23.096
A game?

20:23.931 --> 20:24.931
A game doesn't give a man

20:25.016 --> 20:27.559
what he needs to make a life,
feed his family.

20:27.643 --> 20:31.479
-If I win, great things could happen.
-Nothing will happen.

20:32.982 --> 20:35.442
They'll use you
for their own amusement.

20:35.526 --> 20:38.612
I can do this.
This is something I'm good at.

20:40.323 --> 20:41.406
What if you do?

20:41.490 --> 20:43.992
What will you get for your $50?

20:47.163 --> 20:49.205
I had dreams too, Francis.

20:49.790 --> 20:51.666
No matter what you do,

20:52.168 --> 20:54.961
they'll never let you cross that street.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.757
All I want is a chance.

21:05.765 --> 21:06.932
Okay.

21:08.434 --> 21:10.477
Okay, we make a bargain.

21:11.646 --> 21:14.105
You promise me if you lose,
no more golf.

21:14.190 --> 21:16.483
You give up this fool's game.

21:16.567 --> 21:18.860
You finish your schooling,
you learn a trade

21:18.945 --> 21:21.821
and you bring home an honest wage.

21:23.866 --> 21:25.700
If I don't qualify?

21:26.577 --> 21:28.119
Yes, I promise.

21:58.025 --> 22:01.403
It's the English edition.
It's not in print here yet.

22:02.238 --> 22:03.905
Harry Vardon.

22:06.867 --> 22:07.951
Thank you.

22:08.035 --> 22:09.744
Read it, study it.

22:10.746 --> 22:13.081
You'll need a 78 to qualify.

22:13.582 --> 22:15.166
Stiffer competition.

22:15.251 --> 22:18.169
These are the best amateurs
in the country.

22:19.463 --> 22:20.505
Do you think I'm ready?

22:20.589 --> 22:23.758
I don't know, and neither
will you until you're in it.

22:23.843 --> 22:26.928
There's golf,
and there's championship golf.

22:31.976 --> 22:33.309
Keep it for me.

22:33.394 --> 22:35.311
I'm going to the party.

22:36.939 --> 22:39.607
They said all players are invited.

22:42.403 --> 22:43.361
What's it like in there?

22:43.446 --> 22:46.448
I couldn't tell you.
I'm not allowed inside.

23:34.914 --> 23:36.956
Do me a favor, would you?

23:37.249 --> 23:38.583
Hi.

23:38.667 --> 23:42.879
Hi. This boy I used to see
before I left for college is after me.

23:42.963 --> 23:45.799
-Pretend you asked me to dance.
-There you are, you peach.

23:45.883 --> 23:48.009
You know,
you can't avoid me all evening.

23:48.094 --> 23:51.346
I... I said a dance, Phillip.

23:51.847 --> 23:53.348
Not this one.

23:53.808 --> 23:56.601
-I promised this one to...
-Francis Ouimet.

23:56.685 --> 23:59.437
-Do I know your family?
-I don't know.

23:59.522 --> 24:01.147
-Phillip Wainwright?
-Wainwright?

24:01.232 --> 24:03.608
Oh, yes. Wainwrights, good people.

24:03.692 --> 24:05.235
Wainwrights.

24:09.406 --> 24:12.784
Well, the evening's young.
She'll catch up with you.

24:18.374 --> 24:20.166
You're a real sport for helping.

24:20.251 --> 24:21.918
It's no trouble.

24:26.215 --> 24:27.924
I had the craziest day.

24:28.008 --> 24:30.051
I take a train from Philadelphia,

24:30.136 --> 24:32.345
my bags end up in Baltimore.

24:32.429 --> 24:34.973
My tux is in the bags in Baltimore.

24:36.225 --> 24:38.685
I'm wearing the houseman's suit.

24:41.730 --> 24:43.898
I think you look just fine.

24:44.567 --> 24:45.900
You too.

24:48.028 --> 24:49.487
Is he gone?

24:51.866 --> 24:53.491
No, he's still watching.

24:53.576 --> 24:55.201
Shall we dance?

25:10.384 --> 25:12.760
You said you're going to college?

25:12.845 --> 25:14.929
Smith. First semester.

25:16.849 --> 25:18.683
Where are you going?

25:19.351 --> 25:20.810
To college?

25:23.022 --> 25:26.191
I'm taking the year off
to consider my options.

25:27.026 --> 25:28.943
I think that's so wise.

25:29.445 --> 25:31.070
Perhaps you'll go to Europe.

25:31.155 --> 25:34.449
Perhaps I will.
'Cause I have family in France.

25:36.785 --> 25:39.704
I'm sorry. What did you
say your name was again?

25:39.788 --> 25:41.623
Francis. Ouimet.

25:44.960 --> 25:47.253
Oh, look! There's my brother!

25:51.634 --> 25:55.053
-Freddie, you must know Francis.
-Freddie.

25:56.597 --> 25:58.014
Caddie Boy.

25:58.807 --> 26:01.100
Freddie, you're such a kidder.

26:02.895 --> 26:05.563
Dad, Mother, this is Francis Ouimet.

26:05.648 --> 26:07.065
How do you do?

26:07.149 --> 26:09.317
That's a beautiful dress.

26:09.401 --> 26:10.985
Francis is playing in the tournament.

26:11.070 --> 26:12.695
Yes, yes, I know.

26:14.031 --> 26:15.949
Well, you boys chat.

26:16.450 --> 26:18.910
Mother and I will be right back.

26:26.335 --> 26:28.461
Swell girl, your daughter.

26:28.879 --> 26:31.673
Young man,
you may have been invited,

26:32.007 --> 26:35.009
but don't get the idea
that you belong here.

26:54.280 --> 26:55.989
There are only two types of player.

26:56.073 --> 26:58.866
Those who keep their nerves
in control and win championships,

26:58.951 --> 27:00.827
and those who do not.

28:35.005 --> 28:37.215
Five or less, and you make the cut.

28:37.299 --> 28:40.218
Eighteen?
I can make five here in my sleep.

28:50.479 --> 28:52.105
That's the one.

29:54.376 --> 29:55.960
Congratulations.

29:56.044 --> 29:57.420
That's too bad, Caddie Boy.

29:57.504 --> 29:59.881
You could caddie
for me in the tournament.

29:59.965 --> 30:01.966
You're available, right?

30:02.384 --> 30:04.886
Congratulations, son. Well played.

31:43.986 --> 31:45.570
Empire, Harry.

31:45.946 --> 31:48.906
The sun never sets on us,
all that rubbish.

31:50.033 --> 31:53.911
Consider the glory that was Greece
of Alexander the Great.

31:53.996 --> 31:56.539
Now you can't even find it on a map.

31:57.791 --> 32:01.168
Greece introduced sport to the world,

32:01.253 --> 32:03.629
pure expression of their superiority.

32:03.714 --> 32:06.173
We've trodden that same road.

32:06.258 --> 32:08.926
Football, cricket, rugby, golf.

32:09.511 --> 32:13.014
All the major championships
remain in British hands.

32:13.348 --> 32:14.682
Save one.

32:16.184 --> 32:18.311
So, what are you proposing?

32:18.770 --> 32:20.438
The U.S. Open.

32:22.357 --> 32:24.233
You won it before.

32:24.318 --> 32:26.986
I want you to mount a new campaign

32:27.070 --> 32:28.946
to do to the Americans

32:29.031 --> 32:31.657
what Alexander did to the Persians.

32:32.534 --> 32:34.327
Lay waste to 'em.

32:36.038 --> 32:38.414
My papers get exclusive coverage.

32:38.498 --> 32:41.834
Bernard here comes along
to chronicle your conquest.

32:42.210 --> 32:43.628
It's our game, man.

32:43.712 --> 32:46.756
Win their Open
and bring back that trophy.

32:49.343 --> 32:51.969
You pocket your winnings, of course.

32:52.596 --> 32:54.388
Wouldn't even pay for the crossing, sir.

32:54.473 --> 32:56.307
All expenses paid.

32:56.391 --> 32:59.810
As part of an exhibition tour,
all sponsors arranged.

32:59.895 --> 33:01.646
Does that cover it?

33:05.067 --> 33:06.984
Yep. That'd do it.

33:07.069 --> 33:10.905
And I hear there's talk of an
honorary membership at the club.

33:11.323 --> 33:12.698
This would clinch it.

33:12.783 --> 33:16.035
And I daresay His Majesty
might want to show his gratitude

33:16.119 --> 33:18.412
to England's greatest sportsman.

33:18.497 --> 33:21.248
Harry Vardon,
Order of the British Empire.

33:21.333 --> 33:23.250
Has a nice ring to it.

33:27.923 --> 33:31.217
I'll need a partner.
Somebody to share the workload with.

33:31.301 --> 33:33.886
My thoughts exactly.
Young Wilfred here is your man.

33:33.970 --> 33:36.055
Top amateur in the British Isles.

33:36.139 --> 33:37.848
Delighted, old chap.

33:37.933 --> 33:40.059
Jolly good wheeze, what?

33:40.143 --> 33:42.812
Giving the Yanks
a thorough thrashing.

33:47.025 --> 33:49.193
I had someone else in mind.

33:51.613 --> 33:53.030
Just a few more steps...

33:53.115 --> 33:55.700
Ted Ray? Christ, he's a Visigoth.

33:56.076 --> 33:57.159
No, he's a Jerseyman.

33:58.745 --> 34:00.079
'Scuse me.

34:12.968 --> 34:14.635
All bets off!

34:24.396 --> 34:26.313
-Come on!
-Come on!

34:39.870 --> 34:41.662
-Ted!
-Harry!

34:41.747 --> 34:44.331
Harry! Hey! Look at you!

34:45.292 --> 34:48.753
What's this, another night out
with your ruling class masters?

34:48.837 --> 34:50.838
Ted Ray, Lord Northcliffe.

34:51.256 --> 34:54.633
Lord Northcliffe?
The honor is entirely mine.

34:58.805 --> 35:01.182
What brings you down this way, Harry?

35:31.421 --> 35:34.965
They moved the Open back
three months so one guy can play in it?

35:35.050 --> 35:36.342
He's Harry Vardon,

35:36.426 --> 35:38.511
The Stylist, The Greyhound.

35:38.595 --> 35:40.721
Hey, I don't care
if he's the man in the moon.

35:40.806 --> 35:42.973
They wouldn't do that for an American.

35:43.058 --> 35:45.518
Ask Francis. He used to play.

35:46.394 --> 35:48.896
-You did?
-No, not really.

35:50.232 --> 35:52.149
He's being modest.

35:52.234 --> 35:53.651
He used to be good
before he gave it up

35:53.735 --> 35:56.737
for the glamour of retail.
Right, Francis?

35:59.074 --> 36:00.407
Francis!

36:01.576 --> 36:02.910
Francis!

38:13.750 --> 38:17.169
Oh, well. It was glorious.

38:18.380 --> 38:20.839
-Wasn't it glorious?
-Yes, it was.

38:21.257 --> 38:23.801
Have you ever heard such a voice?

38:25.553 --> 38:28.722
It was like the music
was coming through her

38:29.516 --> 38:31.600
from someplace else.

38:32.435 --> 38:35.187
That's the feeling I've always wanted...

38:39.192 --> 38:40.901
Francis, for what?

38:56.376 --> 38:58.877
There he is. Francis! Come here.

38:59.421 --> 39:03.757
Meet Robert Watson, president of
the United States Golf Association.

39:05.301 --> 39:06.927
Francis, pleasure.

39:07.012 --> 39:09.346
Well, the pleasure's mine, sir.

39:10.140 --> 39:11.849
Let me have a salesman
show you our equipment.

39:11.933 --> 39:15.019
-It's the best selection in Boston.
-He's not here to buy clubs.

39:15.103 --> 39:18.022
I hear you live in Brookline,
not far from the country club.

39:18.106 --> 39:19.356
Across the street.

39:19.441 --> 39:22.943
We're holding our Open Championship
there in two weeks.

39:23.028 --> 39:26.280
-Your name came up.
-My name, sir?

39:26.364 --> 39:28.449
I'm looking to add
a local amateur to the field.

39:28.533 --> 39:31.118
Harry Vardon's playing. And Ted Ray.

39:35.790 --> 39:37.249
Mr. Watson,

39:38.084 --> 39:40.502
thank you, but I can't accept.

39:41.171 --> 39:43.672
-Why not?
-I'm awfully busy here.

39:43.757 --> 39:46.800
And... I don't play golf anymore.

39:48.303 --> 39:51.096
-How old are you, Francis?
-I'm 20, sir.

39:52.182 --> 39:55.059
Awfully young to be giving up
on your dreams, aren't you?

39:55.143 --> 39:58.145
I just have different ones now, that's all.

39:59.522 --> 40:01.315
I'm sorry, Mr. Hastings.

40:01.399 --> 40:04.068
There's no need to explain, Francis.

40:05.028 --> 40:06.737
All the best.

41:07.924 --> 41:09.466
That swing looks familiar.

41:09.551 --> 41:10.717
Hey!

41:11.427 --> 41:12.469
What are you doing here?

41:12.554 --> 41:14.763
Father's taking me out
for our annual round.

41:15.723 --> 41:18.058
My brother said that
you were working here.

41:18.143 --> 41:19.309
Your brother.

41:19.394 --> 41:21.979
I've seen him in here a couple of times.

41:22.063 --> 41:25.357
I was hoping you could
sell me some equipment.

41:25.441 --> 41:27.734
I'm not actually a salesman.

41:28.403 --> 41:30.654
Still considering your options?

41:30.738 --> 41:31.864
Yeah.

41:36.578 --> 41:38.537
I'll go get you a salesman.

42:03.104 --> 42:04.479
All right.

42:11.988 --> 42:13.488
Harry Vardon.

42:13.948 --> 42:16.283
The Stylist. Practice round.

42:23.041 --> 42:26.752
We're expecting a big turnout.
It's important we have marshals here...

42:26.836 --> 42:29.713
Mr. Watson. Francis Ouimet.
Could I speak to you?

42:29.797 --> 42:30.756
Yes, what is it?

42:30.840 --> 42:33.550
If that offer is still good,
I'll take you up on it.

42:33.635 --> 42:35.219
I'm busy. We'll think about that.

42:35.303 --> 42:38.180
-I'm not asking for favors...
-Give us a moment?

42:38.264 --> 42:39.806
What about Grove Street?

42:53.655 --> 42:55.280
Meet me here, sunup.

42:56.866 --> 42:58.909
You got some work to do.

43:56.676 --> 43:58.343
Billy, where do we stand?

43:58.428 --> 44:00.220
Cut line's 76.

44:00.305 --> 44:02.723
Six holes to make up four shots.

44:35.214 --> 44:36.882
What is it? What's wrong?

44:36.966 --> 44:39.593
-You just made six straight birdies.
-I did?

44:39.677 --> 44:42.512
Congratulations, lad.
You're in the Open.

44:52.023 --> 44:53.440
Gentlemen?

44:54.484 --> 44:57.444
I want to welcome you all,
professionals and amateurs alike,

44:57.528 --> 45:00.655
to the 18th United States
Open Championship.

45:06.329 --> 45:08.830
Four rounds of golf
played over the next two days

45:08.915 --> 45:11.750
to identify the best player in the world.

45:12.168 --> 45:13.960
Let's give a special welcome

45:14.045 --> 45:17.422
to the British Amateur Champion,
Mr. Wilfred Reid

45:19.550 --> 45:21.885
and our famous professional visitors,

45:21.969 --> 45:24.221
Harry Vardon and Ted Ray.

45:28.101 --> 45:31.311
I'll yield the floor
to our defending champion,

45:31.979 --> 45:35.065
professional from Philadelphia,
John McDermott.

45:45.368 --> 45:47.661
If you read the papers,
you know there's talk

45:47.745 --> 45:51.915
about the great English champions
sailing over here to play in our Open.

45:51.999 --> 45:54.084
As the only born American
to win this cup,

45:54.168 --> 45:56.253
I'd like to say to you boys, welcome.

45:56.337 --> 45:58.922
-We're happy to have you.
-Hear, hear!

45:59.257 --> 46:00.757
Harry Vardon was winning Opens

46:00.842 --> 46:03.844
back when most of us
were learning our ABC's.

46:05.930 --> 46:08.723
He's a genius
in the history of our game.

46:10.059 --> 46:13.228
Mr. Vardon, I know you won
this baby once before,

46:13.312 --> 46:15.313
and I see your name here.

46:15.898 --> 46:18.733
It's a long time ago, by the look of it.

46:21.988 --> 46:25.532
Well, we hope you boys have
a nice time here in Boston.

46:25.867 --> 46:28.326
Personally, I don't think you will.

46:28.411 --> 46:30.829
I don't care if you whupped every
single one of us the last six weeks,

46:30.913 --> 46:34.624
I'm sick and tired of people saying
all you have to do to win is show up!

46:34.709 --> 46:37.711
This time you're not taking
our damn cup back!

46:43.384 --> 46:44.801
Might just have to kill that one.

46:46.095 --> 46:47.721
Thank you, sir.

46:48.014 --> 46:49.222
Billy.

46:49.891 --> 46:51.641
See you first thing tomorrow morning?

46:51.726 --> 46:53.768
-I can't.
-Well, why not?

46:54.228 --> 46:57.731
This English fella offered me
20 bucks, 50 if he wins.

47:00.151 --> 47:02.986
Well, I can't give you
anything like that.

47:03.070 --> 47:06.072
I'm sorry, Francis.
I got two kids at home.

47:13.080 --> 47:14.164
Mr. Campbell?

47:14.248 --> 47:16.208
I lost my caddie.
Do you know somebody?

47:16.292 --> 47:19.211
-Sorry, all the lads are taken.
-What should I do?

47:19.295 --> 47:21.713
Hitch up your knickers.
You think Vardon and Ray

47:21.797 --> 47:23.882
will take pity because
you carry your own bag?

47:23.966 --> 47:26.760
This is the Open.
Every man for himself.

47:30.139 --> 47:32.140
What am I doing here?

47:35.269 --> 47:36.853
Hey, Francis!

47:36.938 --> 47:38.855
Jack! What are you doing here?

47:38.940 --> 47:41.358
Me and Eddie hooked school
to come watch.

47:41.442 --> 47:43.652
Hey. Are you still caddying
out at Franklin Park?

47:43.736 --> 47:46.780
-That's right.
-Can you carry for me tomorrow?

47:47.281 --> 47:49.115
-In the Open?
-Yeah.

47:51.953 --> 47:54.037
Well, what happened to your guy?

47:54.121 --> 47:55.163
He got a better offer.

47:55.248 --> 47:57.916
Then that guy's a big, fat jerk! What?

47:59.210 --> 48:00.293
Jack, if you're gonna do this,

48:00.378 --> 48:03.129
you gotta be here
tomorrow at 7:30 sharp.

48:03.756 --> 48:04.798
Do it!

48:04.882 --> 48:06.633
Can Eddie come too?

48:07.385 --> 48:08.718
Jack, I can't change the rules.

48:08.803 --> 48:11.137
You're only allowed
one man on the bag.

48:17.061 --> 48:21.106
Maybe he could walk with us
and keep score. We'll figure it out.

48:21.983 --> 48:24.234
-Is that okay with you?
-Sure.

48:24.569 --> 48:26.653
Francis, you got yourself a deal.

48:26.737 --> 48:28.238
That's great, Jack. That's great.

48:28.322 --> 48:29.322
I'll see ya, Eddie.

48:34.495 --> 48:36.329
I'll get it, Henry!

48:39.417 --> 48:40.917
And what do you want?

48:41.002 --> 48:43.128
I was hoping to speak to Sarah.
Is she here?

48:43.212 --> 48:45.088
She left for college.

48:45.673 --> 48:48.008
-When, today?
-Yeah.

48:50.886 --> 48:52.012
Give her a message for me.

48:55.349 --> 48:56.600
Who was that, Freddie?

48:56.684 --> 48:59.019
It was no one. It was a peddler.

48:59.895 --> 49:02.188
Did you hear about the caddie
playing in the Open?

49:02.273 --> 49:05.233
Should never have happened.
Reflects badly on all concerned.

49:05.318 --> 49:09.154
I say, if he wants to go out
and make a fool of himself again,

49:09.238 --> 49:10.822
-so much the better.
-Who are you talking about?

49:10.906 --> 49:13.617
-It's a club matter, dear.
-Caddie Boy.

49:15.036 --> 49:17.412
-Ouimet.
-Insists he's an amateur.

49:18.039 --> 49:20.248
What is the world coming to?

49:20.333 --> 49:23.335
-More bisque, sir?
-Thank you, Henry.

49:23.878 --> 49:26.838
And what kind of pie does
Audrey have for us tonight?

49:26.922 --> 49:30.008
-Huckleberry, sir.
-Splendid.

49:40.144 --> 49:42.937
Did you think
you could keep it from me?

49:44.190 --> 49:46.983
-I didn't try to.
-Your name is in the newspaper.

49:47.068 --> 49:49.152
Sneaking around behind my back.

49:49.236 --> 49:52.906
-No, no, no, Father...
-You're going to stop this now.

49:52.990 --> 49:56.284
A man knows his place
and makes his peace with it.

49:56.369 --> 49:59.287
-I can't talk about this.
-Then you listen.

49:59.914 --> 50:03.333
This is for your own good.
I am trying to protect you.

50:03.417 --> 50:04.668
Protect me from what?

50:04.752 --> 50:08.963
Francis, those men don't have
to earn a place in this world.

50:09.048 --> 50:10.924
It's given to them.

50:11.008 --> 50:13.218
We're not those kind of people.

50:13.969 --> 50:16.763
Now, you go tell them
that you can't do this.

50:16.847 --> 50:18.431
It's a mistake.

50:21.936 --> 50:23.728
I won't do that.

50:27.274 --> 50:29.275
You gave me your word.

50:30.736 --> 50:33.530
You gave me your word.

50:33.781 --> 50:36.032
I can't quit now. I'm sorry.

50:39.286 --> 50:41.996
Then so help me, when this is over,

50:42.081 --> 50:44.708
you find somewhere else to live.

50:58.931 --> 51:00.056
Fine.

51:22.580 --> 51:25.123
Make sure these people
get the etiquette guide.

51:25.207 --> 51:27.459
Most of them have never
been on a golf course.

51:27.543 --> 51:29.210
God help us.

51:30.379 --> 51:31.963
Mr. Ouimet!

51:32.882 --> 51:34.299
Mr. Ouimet!

51:37.928 --> 51:39.179
Eddie!

51:39.597 --> 51:41.556
Where's Jack? I tee off in ten minutes.

51:41.640 --> 51:43.641
Truant officer caught him.
He's in school.

51:43.726 --> 51:47.103
-Why aren't you with him?
-This is the U.S. Open.

51:47.188 --> 51:48.813
Thanks for coming to tell me.

51:48.898 --> 51:51.316
Mr. Ouimet, I can caddie for you.

51:52.193 --> 51:54.903
Eddie, my bag is as big as you are.

51:54.987 --> 51:55.987
But I can do it!

51:56.071 --> 51:59.073
I carry for lots of fellas at Franklin Park.
Ask them.

51:59.158 --> 52:01.326
I came to make good
on what Jack promised.

52:01.410 --> 52:05.079
I hooked school, took three
streetcars and I am big enough!

52:05.164 --> 52:07.123
I'm in 5th grade,
and I want to caddie for you!

52:07.208 --> 52:09.292
Just a second. Calm down.

52:09.376 --> 52:12.712
How about this? I'll carry my bag,
and you walk next to me.

52:12.797 --> 52:14.464
-No, Mr. Ouimet!
-Call me Francis.

52:14.548 --> 52:16.132
-I can do it, Mr. Ouimet.
-Francis.

52:16.217 --> 52:19.511
I know your game. I've seen you play.
I can carry that bag!

52:19.595 --> 52:21.304
All right. All right.

52:21.388 --> 52:23.973
You can caddie for me. Okay?

52:24.058 --> 52:25.642
But you're gonna have
to call me Francis.

52:25.726 --> 52:27.894
-Okay, Francis.
-All right.

52:33.150 --> 52:34.734
You got a problem?

52:34.819 --> 52:37.237
This is the 9:45 tee time.

52:37.571 --> 52:41.407
Professional from
Cattawaukee Golf Club, Albert Murray.

52:46.914 --> 52:51.000
From Brookline, Massachusetts,
amateur Mr. Francis Ouimet.

53:45.472 --> 53:46.973
Whatever you decide, Francis,

53:47.057 --> 53:49.058
keep your head down
and I'll watch the ball.

53:49.143 --> 53:50.727
We're gonna par this hole.

54:13.000 --> 54:15.335
That's the stuff. One shot at a time.

54:31.518 --> 54:33.853
One putt, we get that par.

54:33.938 --> 54:35.647
Nice and steady now.

54:35.731 --> 54:38.358
Make it roll, it'll seek the hole.

54:55.751 --> 54:58.002
Easy peazy, lemon squeezy.

55:15.145 --> 55:16.479
Yes!

55:50.973 --> 55:53.141
He's not supposed to miss those.

55:53.225 --> 55:54.308
Third one this morning.

55:55.352 --> 55:57.770
What the devil's wrong with him?

55:58.272 --> 56:00.523
I'm sure I don't know, sir.

56:47.071 --> 56:49.322
It's in the bleeding trees,
you bunch o'ninnies.

56:50.324 --> 56:54.494
Ted! Rotten luck, old boy!
Just one of those days, what?

56:55.037 --> 56:57.330
Still a lot of golf to play yet!

56:58.832 --> 56:59.999
Toffee-nosed git.

57:10.302 --> 57:12.428
There are only two types of player.

57:12.513 --> 57:15.807
Those who keep their nerves
in control and win championships,

57:15.891 --> 57:17.767
and those who do not.

57:40.999 --> 57:43.751
Hey, Francis, who's that big, fat guy?

57:46.213 --> 57:49.173
Oh, my gosh. It's President Taft.

57:49.883 --> 57:51.801
Get out! President Taft?

57:52.511 --> 57:54.637
The United States President Taft?

57:54.721 --> 57:57.515
-You ever seen a president before?
-First time.

57:57.599 --> 58:00.560
Hey!
How you doing there, Mr. President?

58:03.522 --> 58:07.066
Francis!
Did you just birdie your last hole?

58:07.526 --> 58:09.026
I guess I did, Frank.

58:09.111 --> 58:11.779
Holy smokes.
Francis, you're tied with Vardon.

58:11.864 --> 58:14.031
-You're in second place.
-I am?

58:14.116 --> 58:16.742
President Taft is talking about you.

58:16.827 --> 58:17.994
President Taft.

58:18.078 --> 58:21.497
-Isn't it incredible?
-Okay, we're working here, buddy.

58:21.582 --> 58:22.999
Don't listen to him, Francis.

58:23.083 --> 58:26.460
We play our game,
let those guys worry about theirs.

58:29.006 --> 58:30.464
I'm tied...

58:39.266 --> 58:42.393
You're tied with Vardon.
You're in second place.

58:53.947 --> 58:55.281
Oh, God.

59:32.319 --> 59:34.195
Thanks for nothing!

1:00:00.931 --> 1:00:03.057
We gotta settle down now, Francis.

1:00:03.141 --> 1:00:05.685
Oh, yeah? How are we gonna do that?

1:00:06.353 --> 1:00:09.021
You're just gonna have to play better.

1:00:10.190 --> 1:00:12.149
Keep your head down.

1:00:54.067 --> 1:00:56.610
-Give me the mashie.
-You're not gonna reach with that.

1:00:56.695 --> 1:00:57.737
If he can, I can.

1:01:24.806 --> 1:01:27.183
In round two,
Harry Vardon's pulled even

1:01:27.267 --> 1:01:29.685
with the defending champion,
John McDermott,

1:01:29.770 --> 1:01:33.981
but Mr. Wilfred Reid
is matching him shot for shot.

1:01:34.608 --> 1:01:36.400
After a poor showing this morning,

1:01:36.485 --> 1:01:39.445
Ted Ray's stalking
the grounds like a mad brute.

1:01:39.571 --> 1:01:41.947
He... Mad brute.

1:01:42.991 --> 1:01:46.452
He may yet have something
to say about this championship.

1:01:57.089 --> 1:01:58.381
Quiet.

1:02:11.103 --> 1:02:12.686
Go, go, go, go!

1:02:12.771 --> 1:02:13.896
Get in.

1:02:19.653 --> 1:02:20.861
Blimey.

1:02:21.196 --> 1:02:23.322
They're easily entertained.

1:02:23.657 --> 1:02:25.408
I'm counting on you, old boy,

1:02:25.492 --> 1:02:27.910
if Vardon and that great ape
of his can't deliver.

1:02:27.994 --> 1:02:30.037
Quite. All for England.

1:02:30.122 --> 1:02:32.998
Save that patriotic gibberish
for the newspapers.

1:02:33.083 --> 1:02:35.918
The prime minister has
promised me a seat in his cabinet

1:02:36.002 --> 1:02:37.253
if I bring back this trophy.

1:02:37.337 --> 1:02:40.673
And rest assured, Wilfred,
you will be remembered.

1:02:42.426 --> 1:02:43.759
Bravo, Harry.

1:02:43.844 --> 1:02:45.928
You're tied with me for the lead.

1:02:46.012 --> 1:02:49.390
-Very well played, sir.
-All for king and country, what?

1:02:49.474 --> 1:02:50.933
Wilfred played splendidly.

1:02:51.017 --> 1:02:54.937
More than can be said
for your man Ray. Wild as a Hottentot.

1:02:55.021 --> 1:02:58.190
After his first round,
he won't survive the cut.

1:02:59.985 --> 1:03:01.944
What on Earth
are they going on about?

1:03:02.028 --> 1:03:04.155
Ted Ray's broken
the course scoring record.

1:03:07.534 --> 1:03:09.869
By Jove, Ray's tied for second!

1:03:20.213 --> 1:03:23.382
Mr. Ouimet? One question, sir!

1:03:23.467 --> 1:03:24.758
Francis!

1:03:25.510 --> 1:03:28.012
Hey!
I thought you'd gone back to college!

1:03:28.096 --> 1:03:31.474
-I thought you quit playing!
-I guess I changed my mind.

1:03:31.558 --> 1:03:33.142
-That's wonderful!
-Yeah.

1:03:33.226 --> 1:03:35.644
It's great to see you.
Can you come back tomorrow?

1:03:35.729 --> 1:03:38.856
-I have to leave tomorrow!
-Come back tomorrow!

1:03:45.864 --> 1:03:47.740
Are you his caddie?

1:03:49.493 --> 1:03:51.827
Give this to him, would you?

1:03:54.748 --> 1:03:56.123
For luck.

1:04:01.922 --> 1:04:04.006
Dames. Who needs them?

1:04:21.608 --> 1:04:23.776
Fine play today, Mr. Ouimet.

1:04:24.402 --> 1:04:26.946
Thank you, sir. You too.

1:04:29.199 --> 1:04:31.534
It's mostly dumb luck, though.

1:04:33.745 --> 1:04:35.412
On my part. Not on your part.

1:04:35.497 --> 1:04:38.290
I mean, you don't need luck.
I need luck.

1:04:41.127 --> 1:04:43.087
Well, good luck, then.

1:04:44.005 --> 1:04:45.548
Thank you, sir.

1:04:53.682 --> 1:04:56.559
I cleaned them good.
Wiped the grips too.

1:04:59.271 --> 1:05:00.729
You did fine out there today.

1:05:00.814 --> 1:05:02.731
You too, Francis.

1:05:02.816 --> 1:05:04.567
You gonna skip school
again tomorrow?

1:05:04.651 --> 1:05:06.318
Let them try and stop me.

1:05:08.321 --> 1:05:09.738
You get home safe.

1:05:09.823 --> 1:05:12.825
Don't you worry about me.
I'll meet you right here.

1:05:12.909 --> 1:05:14.910
Early bird gets the worm.

1:05:14.995 --> 1:05:16.120
Deal.

1:05:37.434 --> 1:05:40.144
All I can say, ladies,
is that when the day began,

1:05:40.228 --> 1:05:42.479
I scarcely imagined that I'd find myself

1:05:42.564 --> 1:05:45.274
tied for the lead
with the immortal Harry Vardon,

1:05:45.358 --> 1:05:48.986
and two strokes ahead
of the ever-so-capable Ted Ray.

1:05:49.904 --> 1:05:52.489
Speak of the devil, and up he pops.

1:05:52.866 --> 1:05:55.909
Excuse me, ladies.
I'll be with you presently.

1:05:59.497 --> 1:06:02.207
I simply adore Americans.

1:06:02.292 --> 1:06:05.669
The exuberance,
such charming naiveté.

1:06:07.130 --> 1:06:09.298
How do you find them, Ted?

1:06:09.382 --> 1:06:11.592
I should imagine you feel right at home.

1:06:11.676 --> 1:06:15.471
They clasp all manner of the huddled,
yearning masses to their bosoms.

1:06:15.555 --> 1:06:18.140
Even the lowly golf professional.

1:06:18.224 --> 1:06:20.559
You know, I can foresee a day,

1:06:20.644 --> 1:06:23.562
given their democratic standards,

1:06:24.064 --> 1:06:26.774
when they invite your kind
into their clubhouses.

1:06:26.858 --> 1:06:29.026
Well, how could they resist?

1:06:29.110 --> 1:06:32.071
Two poor lads from Jersey,
up from nothing.

1:06:32.155 --> 1:06:35.115
Working-class heroes
to the great unwashed.

1:06:35.200 --> 1:06:39.078
When all Jersey's ever given us
are potatoes and dairy cows...

1:06:42.207 --> 1:06:44.083
Don't look over there.

1:06:45.085 --> 1:06:47.795
Sorry, Harry. I couldn't contain myself.

1:06:48.713 --> 1:06:50.172
Neither could he.

1:06:50.256 --> 1:06:52.341
He shouldn't have
brought Jersey into it.

1:06:59.432 --> 1:07:02.184
My God. My nose.

1:07:07.107 --> 1:07:08.899
Do I look all right?

1:07:09.776 --> 1:07:12.820
Quite frankly, Mr. Reid,
it's an improvement.

1:07:16.199 --> 1:07:18.867
So, did you really see the president?

1:07:19.869 --> 1:07:21.495
He waved at me.

1:07:21.579 --> 1:07:23.455
-No!
-Yes, he did. President Taft.

1:07:23.540 --> 1:07:25.582
Can you believe Francis?

1:07:25.667 --> 1:07:28.961
-Why don't I sleep downstairs tonight?
-No. You sleep upstairs.

1:07:29.045 --> 1:07:31.088
-You'll need sleep for tomorrow.
-I'm okay.

1:07:32.215 --> 1:07:33.465
Arthur.

1:07:38.012 --> 1:07:41.265
So, they call you Mr. Ouimet.

1:07:42.100 --> 1:07:44.768
The others, it just says their names.

1:07:47.480 --> 1:07:50.816
Well, Father, they're professionals.
I'm an amateur.

1:07:51.651 --> 1:07:55.028
-Let's have some dessert.
-No, wait, wait. Sit, sit.

1:07:56.448 --> 1:07:58.907
They're all talking about you now.

1:08:02.120 --> 1:08:05.330
It say here that if you win,
you get no money.

1:08:06.499 --> 1:08:08.667
The others make money,
you get nothing.

1:08:08.752 --> 1:08:10.753
What does that prove?

1:08:12.589 --> 1:08:14.381
What does that prove?

1:08:15.884 --> 1:08:19.511
They don't even pay you!
What kind of work is that?

1:08:19.596 --> 1:08:20.763
-Arthur.
-What?

1:08:20.847 --> 1:08:22.598
I'll fix you a plate.

1:09:08.770 --> 1:09:11.355
Come on, you! Pull!

1:09:28.832 --> 1:09:30.457
Morning, Harry.

1:09:31.292 --> 1:09:33.085
Dreadful English weather.

1:09:36.506 --> 1:09:38.799
-How'd you sleep?
-Like a baby.

1:09:39.342 --> 1:09:41.343
Woke up every two hours and cried.

1:09:56.776 --> 1:09:58.402
Hey, Francis!

1:09:58.486 --> 1:10:01.446
I had a dream last night
that you shot a 72!

1:10:02.031 --> 1:10:04.116
It won't be easy in a nor'easter.

1:10:04.200 --> 1:10:06.410
You've played the course
in weather like this a hundred times.

1:10:06.494 --> 1:10:08.495
You're right. It's a good day for a 72.

1:10:08.580 --> 1:10:10.622
Okey-dokey, pipe and smokey.

1:10:41.905 --> 1:10:45.157
If the Brits beat us, they'll say
it was a fluke I ever won it.

1:10:45.241 --> 1:10:48.160
They'll say it's their game,
and we're not good enough.

1:10:48.244 --> 1:10:49.995
This is our Open.

1:13:17.810 --> 1:13:19.811
Yes. Marvelous.

1:13:29.280 --> 1:13:33.158
Ouimet. Ouimet. O-U-I-M-E-T.

1:13:33.242 --> 1:13:35.994
He's only one stroke behind
Vardon and Ray after three rounds.

1:13:42.251 --> 1:13:44.503
Go a little deeper there!

1:13:51.385 --> 1:13:53.386
Not here, over there.

1:13:55.598 --> 1:13:57.891
-Move on down!
-Yes, sir!

1:14:33.094 --> 1:14:34.469
Thank you.

1:14:42.019 --> 1:14:43.478
Ray needs that putt for the lead.

1:14:43.563 --> 1:14:45.814
I don't want to hear
how anyone else is doing.

1:14:45.898 --> 1:14:47.774
We play our own game.

1:14:50.736 --> 1:14:52.112
Where do we stand?

1:14:52.196 --> 1:14:55.782
You'd have to par the last five holes
to tie Ted for the lead.

1:14:55.867 --> 1:14:59.202
Dreadful conditions, Harry.
No one would blame you if you came...

1:14:59.287 --> 1:15:01.121
Thank you, Bernard.

1:16:52.233 --> 1:16:54.192
He's done for in there.

1:16:54.527 --> 1:16:56.778
No chance he catches him now.

1:17:41.198 --> 1:17:42.991
What's got into you, old thing?

1:17:43.075 --> 1:17:45.327
You had to go and get me angry.

1:17:45.411 --> 1:17:47.329
Oh, yes. My mistake.

1:17:48.331 --> 1:17:50.999
When I par this one,
we'll have to go at it again tomorrow.

1:17:51.083 --> 1:17:53.293
Playoff? What a bother.

1:17:53.377 --> 1:17:55.253
Yep, but there it is.

1:17:56.088 --> 1:17:58.173
Never seen you smoke
on the job before.

1:17:58.257 --> 1:18:00.592
Should've started four holes earlier.

1:18:54.063 --> 1:18:57.982
All square again.
Not a chance this stripling bears up.

1:19:00.027 --> 1:19:01.194
Probably not.

1:19:29.932 --> 1:19:31.099
Let them look.

1:19:31.183 --> 1:19:34.018
We're tied, you're the one still playing.

1:19:49.034 --> 1:19:51.494
Might as well get out
of this beastly weather

1:19:51.579 --> 1:19:53.663
and raise a glass to British victory.

1:19:53.747 --> 1:19:56.249
What's that carrying his bag, a Pygmy?

1:20:07.970 --> 1:20:09.637
We need two strokes.
Get one here, one at...

1:20:09.722 --> 1:20:12.474
Francis, listen to me.
Don't think so much.

1:20:12.558 --> 1:20:15.894
You can't play them all at once.
Take them one at a time.

1:20:15.978 --> 1:20:18.438
One at a time, two down.
Two down, six to play.

1:20:18.522 --> 1:20:20.899
Get one here and the other on 16.

1:20:20.983 --> 1:20:22.942
That girl wanted me to give you this.

1:20:23.027 --> 1:20:25.153
-What girl?
-Sarah.

1:20:25.237 --> 1:20:27.113
Sarah gave you this?

1:20:27.198 --> 1:20:30.116
Just put it on.
Don't get all sloppy over it.

1:20:39.919 --> 1:20:41.044
To England.

1:20:43.380 --> 1:20:45.423
What the hell was that?

1:20:45.758 --> 1:20:47.467
It's not over yet.

1:21:13.786 --> 1:21:15.954
Well, well. Look who's back.

1:21:44.733 --> 1:21:46.651
-Nice.
-Nice shot!

1:21:48.862 --> 1:21:51.531
Let us through. It's Ouimet's mother.

1:21:59.540 --> 1:22:01.332
What's happening?

1:22:01.959 --> 1:22:04.168
He hit it stone dead at 16.

1:22:04.253 --> 1:22:06.170
He's only down one.

1:22:07.548 --> 1:22:09.716
What does that mean? Is it good?

1:22:09.800 --> 1:22:12.093
He makes this, it's a playoff
with Vardon and Ray.

1:22:12.177 --> 1:22:15.680
Dear me, it's almost beyond
one's ability to calculate.

1:22:17.057 --> 1:22:18.683
Don't mind if I do.

1:22:26.150 --> 1:22:28.443
He can't keep this up. It's impossible.

1:23:36.679 --> 1:23:37.720
I'll be damned.

1:23:40.265 --> 1:23:41.599
Yeah!

1:23:43.977 --> 1:23:45.561
Oh, Francis!

1:24:06.125 --> 1:24:09.252
There will be
an 18-hole playoff tomorrow

1:24:09.336 --> 1:24:12.588
between Vardon, Ray and Mr. Ouimet

1:24:12.673 --> 1:24:14.465
to decide the championship.

1:24:26.770 --> 1:24:28.813
Boy's a gift from the gods.

1:24:29.857 --> 1:24:32.275
They're printing
'round the clock at home.

1:24:32.359 --> 1:24:34.026
Imagine what they're selling here.

1:24:34.111 --> 1:24:37.822
Should have bought one of
these rags when I had the chance.

1:24:38.991 --> 1:24:42.034
It's a bold charge,
but he's spent his powder.

1:24:42.870 --> 1:24:45.246
It's a two-man game now, my lads.

1:24:45.330 --> 1:24:47.206
An all-English final.

1:24:48.333 --> 1:24:50.001
Well, we'll see.

1:24:50.836 --> 1:24:53.504
Come on, Harry. It's inconceivable.

1:24:54.673 --> 1:24:56.841
The man's a bloody amateur.

1:24:57.926 --> 1:24:59.761
When was the last time
you were beaten?

1:24:59.845 --> 1:25:02.013
Have you ever been beaten,
man-to-man,

1:25:02.097 --> 1:25:04.140
in your entire career by an amateur?

1:25:04.224 --> 1:25:06.601
Amateurs do not win Opens.

1:25:06.685 --> 1:25:08.936
Hell, the last one
who won it back home

1:25:09.021 --> 1:25:11.355
was 40 years ago,
and he was a gentleman.

1:25:11.440 --> 1:25:14.859
This one's nothing of the kind.
He's a peasant. Common clay.

1:25:14.943 --> 1:25:17.111
He'll fold like an accordion.

1:25:17.196 --> 1:25:18.738
I need my rest.

1:25:24.369 --> 1:25:28.706
If he couldn't hit the ball a country mile,
he'd be digging ditches.

1:25:33.545 --> 1:25:35.463
Where are you going? Come back.
Sit down.

1:25:35.547 --> 1:25:37.965
Eat with me. Enjoy yourself.

1:25:38.050 --> 1:25:40.343
I came here to win a trophy,

1:25:40.803 --> 1:25:43.137
and on the face of it,
Ted Ray or I should carry it off.

1:25:43.222 --> 1:25:44.972
Not for you, not for England,

1:25:45.057 --> 1:25:48.351
but for sheer bloody pride
at being the best.

1:25:48.435 --> 1:25:51.979
And if Mr. Ouimet wins tomorrow,
it's because he's the best,

1:25:52.064 --> 1:25:53.856
because of who he is.

1:25:54.817 --> 1:25:56.901
Not who his father was,
not how much money he's got,

1:25:56.985 --> 1:25:59.278
because of who he bloody is!

1:26:00.239 --> 1:26:02.865
And I'll thank you to remember that.

1:26:05.077 --> 1:26:06.327
And I'll thank you to show the respect

1:26:06.411 --> 1:26:09.247
a gentleman gives
as a matter of course.

1:26:11.124 --> 1:26:12.500
Good night.

1:26:37.776 --> 1:26:39.777
Do you want him to fail?

1:26:41.363 --> 1:26:45.324
Is that the only satisfaction
you can take from what he's doing?

1:26:47.703 --> 1:26:50.496
You think I want him
to break his heart?

1:26:53.834 --> 1:26:56.586
What will you do, Mary, when he fails?

1:26:56.670 --> 1:26:58.838
How will you help him then?

1:26:59.339 --> 1:27:01.757
All you ever do is encourage him.

1:27:04.219 --> 1:27:07.638
That's right. I do encourage him.

1:27:09.308 --> 1:27:10.892
He has a God-given talent,

1:27:10.976 --> 1:27:14.186
and this is his one chance
to give a voice to it.

1:27:17.608 --> 1:27:20.276
He's just trying to make you proud.

1:27:48.221 --> 1:27:51.682
"It seems impossible to believe
that this untested boy

1:27:51.767 --> 1:27:54.769
"could hope to beat
two seasoned champions.

1:27:57.689 --> 1:28:01.776
"One David against two Goliaths."

1:28:05.781 --> 1:28:08.491
He'll have to face
Vardon and Ray alone,

1:28:08.575 --> 1:28:11.369
with a night to sleep
on the incredible situation

1:28:11.453 --> 1:28:14.205
in which he
so shockingly finds himself.

1:28:15.666 --> 1:28:18.459
Although, I suspect

1:28:18.543 --> 1:28:21.170
from the unearthly calm
he showed today,

1:28:21.254 --> 1:28:23.547
he will sleep better than most.

1:28:26.176 --> 1:28:29.095
I am not certain
I believe Ouimet can win,

1:28:30.389 --> 1:28:33.391
but I have given up
all attempts at prophecy.

1:28:34.142 --> 1:28:37.478
I will start tomorrow's round
with an open mind.

1:28:40.232 --> 1:28:43.359
It should be
the greatest game ever played.

1:29:18.895 --> 1:29:20.271
Young man.

1:29:20.647 --> 1:29:23.691
-We've been talking this over.
-Talking what over?

1:29:23.775 --> 1:29:27.445
The members here feel that you need
as much help as you can get today.

1:29:27.529 --> 1:29:28.529
What kind of help?

1:29:28.613 --> 1:29:30.364
According to the rules, your caddie

1:29:30.449 --> 1:29:32.825
is the only person
who can give you advice.

1:29:32.909 --> 1:29:36.078
You need someone with you
who really knows our course.

1:29:36.163 --> 1:29:37.413
Exactly.

1:29:37.497 --> 1:29:39.582
Eddie's doing a great job for me.

1:29:39.666 --> 1:29:40.750
For God's sake, Ouimet!

1:29:40.834 --> 1:29:44.503
This is the U.S. Open,
not some junior club championship.

1:29:45.297 --> 1:29:47.715
You told Eddie this
before talking to me?

1:29:47.799 --> 1:29:49.300
You can't reason with a boy like that.

1:29:49.384 --> 1:29:52.678
We'll take up a collection
for him and pay him handsomely.

1:29:52.763 --> 1:29:54.722
I understand his family could use it.

1:29:55.140 --> 1:29:56.849
Don't let them do it, Francis!

1:29:56.933 --> 1:29:58.893
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1:29:58.977 --> 1:30:01.312
Is it true?
You know I can't pay you, Eddie.

1:30:01.396 --> 1:30:04.523
I wouldn't do it for ten bucks.
I wouldn't do it for a hundred!

1:30:04.608 --> 1:30:07.151
Listen. You think I'd replace you?

1:30:07.360 --> 1:30:08.444
But they said you'd want to.

1:30:08.528 --> 1:30:11.113
Who cares what they said?
Who cares?

1:30:11.490 --> 1:30:14.450
This is me and you, we're a team.
Okay?

1:30:14.993 --> 1:30:17.119
They don't get a vote in this.

1:30:17.621 --> 1:30:18.996
All right?

1:30:20.499 --> 1:30:22.500
I'll meet you outside.

1:30:29.800 --> 1:30:32.426
Don't ever talk to my caddie again.

1:30:47.859 --> 1:30:50.069
Mr. Ouimet will play first.

1:30:51.863 --> 1:30:55.157
Mr. Darwin will act as honorary marker
and keep your scores.

1:31:00.372 --> 1:31:02.164
Gentlemen, it's time.

1:31:09.172 --> 1:31:10.548
Here he comes!

1:31:10.632 --> 1:31:12.216
Good luck, son!

1:31:14.636 --> 1:31:17.388
-Come on, young man!
-Come on, Ouimet!

1:31:17.806 --> 1:31:20.099
-Come on, Francis!
-Go!

1:31:22.727 --> 1:31:24.728
You can do it, Francis!

1:31:25.856 --> 1:31:28.065
Give us a strong showing, son!

1:32:34.841 --> 1:32:37.343
-Five for you there?
-That's right.

1:32:39.387 --> 1:32:41.305
You can do it, Francis.

1:32:41.389 --> 1:32:43.974
-What?
-Sorry. Did I say something?

1:32:44.976 --> 1:32:46.560
That was big.

1:33:02.994 --> 1:33:05.204
-They're human.
-What's that?

1:33:05.538 --> 1:33:07.373
I can play these guys, Eddie.

1:33:07.457 --> 1:33:08.916
Yeah? Who said you couldn't?

1:33:24.849 --> 1:33:26.850
Maybe they're not human.

1:33:36.236 --> 1:33:38.821
This is where he fell apart the last time.

1:33:48.373 --> 1:33:50.124
That was yesterday.

1:34:05.598 --> 1:34:06.765
Sarah!

1:34:07.183 --> 1:34:09.643
What are you doing here?
You're supposed to be in school.

1:34:09.728 --> 1:34:11.937
Don't be ridiculous, Father.

1:34:16.443 --> 1:34:18.485
He's not cracking, Harry.

1:34:18.903 --> 1:34:21.071
The thought occurred to me.

1:34:21.740 --> 1:34:23.657
"An all-English final."

1:34:33.668 --> 1:34:35.336
Quiet, please.

1:35:09.412 --> 1:35:10.454
Stymied.

1:35:24.719 --> 1:35:27.304
-What are you doing?
-I'll show you.

1:35:48.159 --> 1:35:50.369
Come on, now. Finish him.

1:35:56.000 --> 1:35:58.168
Let's see if he cracks now.

1:36:07.011 --> 1:36:08.095
Fore right!

1:36:15.562 --> 1:36:17.354
He's dead in those trees.

1:36:33.830 --> 1:36:35.247
Mid iron.

1:36:55.393 --> 1:36:58.061
Done in by the monarch of the forest.

1:37:22.670 --> 1:37:25.172
Down to you, old thing. I'm done.

1:37:25.256 --> 1:37:27.257
Pity. It's a great match.

1:37:27.967 --> 1:37:30.052
That's the spirit, Harry.

1:37:33.932 --> 1:37:35.349
Come on, Ouimet!

1:40:21.641 --> 1:40:23.767
-Where you going with that?
-Gonna cut the corner.

1:40:23.851 --> 1:40:25.477
There's a bunker there.

1:40:25.561 --> 1:40:26.895
If he's over it, he's a chip away.

1:40:26.979 --> 1:40:29.815
We don't know he's over it. It's a trick.

1:41:36.048 --> 1:41:37.674
This is our chance, Francis.

1:41:37.759 --> 1:41:40.510
Run it in there, just like yesterday.

1:43:33.958 --> 1:43:37.460
My God. Francis has
a one-stroke lead with one to play.

1:44:39.815 --> 1:44:42.108
Hold the line! Hold the line!

1:45:27.947 --> 1:45:29.531
Take your time.

1:45:39.083 --> 1:45:41.418
Let me have that towel, Eddie.

1:47:56.887 --> 1:47:58.304
Well done.

1:49:19.053 --> 1:49:21.804
You need this for 72. You can do it.

1:49:22.389 --> 1:49:24.807
Read it, roll it and hole it.

1:50:04.265 --> 1:50:05.348
Yeah!

1:50:27.871 --> 1:50:30.623
Yeah! Yeah!

1:50:31.625 --> 1:50:32.917
Yeah!

1:50:41.260 --> 1:50:42.552
Yeah!

1:50:43.053 --> 1:50:45.221
Thank you! Thank you!

1:50:45.306 --> 1:50:47.056
-You did it!
-Thank you!

1:50:48.392 --> 1:50:49.767
Look, Eddie, we did it!

1:50:50.060 --> 1:50:51.436
We did it!

1:51:14.585 --> 1:51:16.502
No! No! I can't take it!

1:51:16.587 --> 1:51:18.421
Pass the hat for Eddie!

1:51:18.505 --> 1:51:20.923
Pass the hat for Eddie! Here!

1:51:25.387 --> 1:51:29.599
Pass the hat for Eddie!
Pass the hat for...

1:53:45.235 --> 1:53:47.320
Well played, Mr. Ouimet.

1:53:47.404 --> 1:53:50.031
That was a great game. I enjoyed it.

1:53:51.533 --> 1:53:52.867
So did I.

1:53:53.452 --> 1:53:54.911
Yes, you did.

1:53:56.538 --> 1:53:59.665
Congratulations on your success.
You deserve it.

1:53:59.750 --> 1:54:01.083
Thank you.

1:54:09.134 --> 1:54:11.260
We'll play again sometime.

1:54:27.819 --> 1:54:29.487
Look at this thing, Francis.

1:54:29.571 --> 1:54:32.073
-It's a whopper.
-Isn't that something?

1:54:32.157 --> 1:54:34.116
They let you take it home with ya?

1:54:34.201 --> 1:54:35.618
Nobody's tried to stop me.

1:54:35.702 --> 1:54:38.120
Well, they'd have to get past me.

1:54:38.956 --> 1:54:40.873
You know something, Eddie?

1:54:40.958 --> 1:54:42.542
You and I are gonna be great friends.

1:54:42.626 --> 1:54:44.627
You said it, Francis.

1:55:37.000 --> 2:00:31.999
