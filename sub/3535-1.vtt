00:25.297 --> 00:27.512
I love NPR.

00:35.755 --> 00:38.220
Look at this guy.
Hey, buddy.

00:38.262 --> 00:40.894
That's not really called for.

00:43.133 --> 00:45.324
I'm not gonna race you, bro.

00:45.357 --> 00:47.674
What? Come on, bro,
are you scared?

00:47.707 --> 00:49.553
Nope. I have no intentions upon
breaking the law today.

00:49.586 --> 00:51.889
Aw, you're not gonna
break the law?

00:51.922 --> 00:54.859
Aww. Hey, buddy.
Check it out.

00:54.932 --> 00:57.198
Oh, real nice.
Put that badonkadonk away.

00:57.231 --> 00:59.275
That does not make me
wanna race you.

01:06.572 --> 01:08.075
Faggot!

01:12.046 --> 01:15.291
I'm not...
a homosexual person.

01:15.324 --> 01:17.533
You are.

01:24.757 --> 01:26.158
All right, sir.
Well, this here is saying

01:26.191 --> 01:28.129
that you are declining
the insurance.

01:28.162 --> 01:29.329
Not interested in GPS,

01:29.370 --> 01:31.603
you obviously know where
you're going.

01:31.931 --> 01:34.069
Just sign right there.
You will be good to go.

01:34.142 --> 01:36.842
I gotta ask, man.
You look real familiar to me.

01:36.883 --> 01:38.114
We don't know each other.
Just go ahead and...

01:38.147 --> 01:40.018
You used to play baseball,
didn't you?

01:40.051 --> 01:41.618
Once upon a time, yes, I did.

01:41.651 --> 01:43.588
Yeah, man.
Ah... hey, baby...

01:43.621 --> 01:44.727
Can I get a picture?

01:44.760 --> 01:45.729
Actually, you know what, sir,

01:45.762 --> 01:47.636
I don't do that kind
of stuff anymore.

01:47.669 --> 01:49.813
I walked away from celebrity
a long time ago

01:49.846 --> 01:51.512
and I no longer take pictures,
so...

01:51.553 --> 01:52.989
Part of my life is over.

01:53.022 --> 01:54.557
So you gonna big time us now?

01:54.590 --> 01:57.191
We just rented a car from you.
We're paying customers.

01:57.232 --> 01:59.804
Yeah, I know. You're paying
for the rental of a Ford Focus,

01:59.837 --> 02:00.742
Not for a picture of a man.

02:00.775 --> 02:02.273
Oh, whatever.
Be a dick about it.

02:02.314 --> 02:03.919
You should be glad somebody
wanna take a picture

02:03.952 --> 02:06.627
- with your washed up ass.
- Hey, Ken. How we doing?

02:06.660 --> 02:07.995
- Everything cool here?
- Yeah.

02:08.027 --> 02:09.491
No. I just asked him
for a picture

02:09.532 --> 02:10.795
and he got all weird
and uppity and shit.

02:10.829 --> 02:12.397
I wasn't being uppity.

02:12.430 --> 02:14.270
Ooh, Ken.

02:14.303 --> 02:16.839
Ken would be happy to give you
a photograph, sir.

02:16.872 --> 02:18.376
Just let me see your phone
and I'll take a picture.

02:18.409 --> 02:20.213
Yeah, I mean, he made it
like it was a big deal

02:20.246 --> 02:21.886
- and everything.
- I'll bet he did.

02:21.887 --> 02:23.550
That's our Ken.

02:23.583 --> 02:26.654
Come on around, Ken.
Step on in. Scooch in there.

02:26.687 --> 02:28.760
Get in there. Why don't
everybody squeeze in there

02:28.793 --> 02:30.065
and make a Ken sammich.

02:30.098 --> 02:31.659
Good composition.
Now let's see a smile.

02:31.666 --> 02:33.836
- Just take the picture, Mark.
- Just smile.

02:33.869 --> 02:36.111
OK. You're doing something weird
with your eyebrows.

02:36.144 --> 02:37.313
I don't even know.

02:37.346 --> 02:38.913
Right. That'll do.

02:38.946 --> 02:41.081
That's it. That's the one.

02:41.114 --> 02:43.153
There you go.
There's your happy memory, sir.

02:43.186 --> 02:45.186
Thank you for choosing
Millenial Rent-A-Car.

02:45.219 --> 02:47.925
- I'll be back.
- Yeah, you will.

02:47.958 --> 02:49.725
Ken, let me talk to you
for a second.

02:49.759 --> 02:53.233
You gotta do the dance
for the customer.

02:53.266 --> 02:55.675
All right, cool?

02:57.247 --> 02:58.786
Mark, please...
Mark, stop.

02:58.851 --> 03:01.285
OK. You got me,
I'm knocked out.

03:01.326 --> 03:03.093
Mark, stop it.

03:03.126 --> 03:04.758
Mark. OK, boom, you got me.

03:04.791 --> 03:06.663
I got beat up, OK.

03:06.696 --> 03:08.601
Mark, I'm not doing
the "ror-ros".

03:08.634 --> 03:12.481
- Come on, rrrr...
- Rrrr. OK.

03:12.514 --> 03:13.851
Seriously, can you
please stop punching me?

03:13.884 --> 03:16.284
All right, all right.
I'll tell you what.

03:16.317 --> 03:17.684
I'm gonna take over here,
what I'm gonna have you do

03:17.725 --> 03:19.957
is go ahead and wash down
a few of the fleet just come in.

03:19.991 --> 03:21.494
You know I've had a full
dance card all morning.

03:21.527 --> 03:22.898
I mean, this shit can't wait
till after lunch?

03:22.931 --> 03:26.439
No. No, better go ahead
and do it now.

03:26.472 --> 03:29.450
Just, I had made a sandwich
that I enj... was hoping to...

03:29.483 --> 03:32.083
Forget it. I'll wash the cars.
Thank you, Mark.

03:33.316 --> 03:35.888
<i>This is a story</i>

03:35.929 --> 03:39.364

03:41.669 --> 03:44.341

03:44.374 --> 03:46.277

04:59.628 --> 05:02.298
Please finish your juice.

05:02.331 --> 05:04.099
Just finished my feature.

05:04.132 --> 05:05.939
What's a feature, Daddy?

05:05.972 --> 05:09.205
A feature is Hollywood industry
jargon for a screenplay.

05:09.246 --> 05:10.774
You know what motion
pictures are?

05:10.815 --> 05:13.712
<i>- Human Centipede.</i>
<i>- Human Centipede.</i> Yes, Shayna.

05:13.753 --> 05:14.878
You remember when
we watched that film?

05:14.919 --> 05:16.212
They ate the poo-poo.

05:16.246 --> 05:18.010
That's right,
they did eat the poo-poo.

05:18.050 --> 05:19.513
And you know what?
Those people didn't just

05:19.546 --> 05:20.586
make that up on their own.

05:20.618 --> 05:22.683
Someone had to write
that they ate poo-poo.

05:22.724 --> 05:24.653
That's what a feature is.
That's what a screenplay is.

05:24.694 --> 05:25.790
That's what your dad just did.

05:25.823 --> 05:28.296
- That movie's gross.
- Whoa, big surprise.

05:28.329 --> 05:29.968
My son got scared
by a horror film.

05:30.001 --> 05:31.832
Shayna didn't have a problem
with it.

05:31.865 --> 05:33.200
Shayna, you like when they
eat the <i>caca,</i> right?

05:33.233 --> 05:35.640
I love you. Look at you.
Eating all your carrots. Gone.

05:35.673 --> 05:38.011
Toby's got a goddamn farmer's
market on his plate over there.

05:38.044 --> 05:39.213
Toby, eat your fucking carrots.

05:39.246 --> 05:42.949
OK, OK. Kenny,
what is this from the bank?

05:42.982 --> 05:47.155
- Did you apply for a loan?
- Oh. Yeah, word.

05:47.188 --> 05:48.954
Yeah, yeah.
This is the loan I applied for.

05:48.987 --> 05:51.754
For the, uh,
backyard swimming pool.

05:51.787 --> 05:53.661
We don't have money for a pool.

05:53.694 --> 05:55.599
That's why I applied
for a loan.

05:55.632 --> 05:59.037
OK. You know what, I have been
running around all day

05:59.070 --> 06:01.837
and we have our friends coming
in just a little bit.

06:01.870 --> 06:03.605
Could you please
put them to bed?

06:03.638 --> 06:05.468
You know, actually,
I was gonna go upstairs

06:05.509 --> 06:07.444
and try to put a really tight
playlist together

06:07.477 --> 06:09.372
for us to like, chill to tonight
when we have this dinner party.

06:09.413 --> 06:12.244
Right. I-I... yeah.

06:12.277 --> 06:14.014
Um, they're the priority.

06:14.047 --> 06:16.952
- So I really need your help.
- I know. Just, like...

06:16.985 --> 06:20.057
Super tight playlist could just
really set the night off right.

06:22.458 --> 06:25.099
OK. Yeah, cool.
We don't need a playlist.

06:25.132 --> 06:28.469
I'll just put the Saturday
chillax-relaxation mix on.

06:28.502 --> 06:32.249
That should probably
translate nicely. Perfect.

06:32.282 --> 06:34.848
I love you.
I love you so much.

06:34.880 --> 06:36.310
I love you.

06:39.586 --> 06:41.893
I need you to finish up
your juice.

06:47.765 --> 06:50.766
- Wha... What happened?
- Hm?

06:50.807 --> 06:54.971
Oh, that vase fell. Now I'm just
trying to find the nightly news.

07:03.317 --> 07:06.117
So I had my testosterone
levels checked the other day,

07:06.150 --> 07:08.555
a couple weeks ago
and they were very low.

07:08.588 --> 07:09.881
As I kind of figured they were.

07:09.921 --> 07:12.887
But the doctor got me
on this application.

07:12.920 --> 07:14.751
- It's like a deodorant.
- That's terrific.

07:14.784 --> 07:16.087
- You just roll it on?
- Yeah.

07:16.120 --> 07:19.428
It gets me into a position
mentally and hormonally

07:19.456 --> 07:22.190
to a place where I am
attracted to my wife.

07:22.231 --> 07:23.994
Before it was like I
couldn't even get near him.

07:24.028 --> 07:25.992
I would wear basically nothing.

07:26.025 --> 07:27.393
And he wouldn't even
look my way.

07:27.426 --> 07:30.436
And now it's great.
We're very healthy, sexually,

07:30.469 --> 07:32.630
- and, yeah, wonderful.
- A little too healthy.

07:32.639 --> 07:34.572
Fascinating.

07:34.605 --> 07:36.305
- Mm-hmm.
- April, I heard

07:36.338 --> 07:38.472
you're being honored.
Is that true?

07:38.505 --> 07:40.937
- It's really nothing.
- What is it? Tell us about it.

07:40.978 --> 07:42.979
It's... it's this silly award

07:43.012 --> 07:46.086
because I just sold the most
houses, um, this year.

07:46.120 --> 07:48.424
- Wow.
- That's amazing. That's huge.

07:48.457 --> 07:50.623
- Yeah.
- No.

07:50.656 --> 07:52.525
Well, I mean, it's not like
she sold the most houses

07:52.558 --> 07:54.588
in the whole country,
it's just in the region

07:54.629 --> 07:58.768
or at her job in this office,
not really all the offices.

07:58.801 --> 08:00.171
Yeah, I mean, just the region.

08:00.204 --> 08:02.338
Big region.
It's a buyers market, though.

08:02.371 --> 08:04.010
- Yeah. True.
- Well, some say.

08:04.043 --> 08:05.778
Some say that the bubble's
already burst

08:05.811 --> 08:07.977
and that it's going the
other way, too, so who knows.

08:08.010 --> 08:09.312
Who says that?

08:09.345 --> 08:11.208
Just the economic
reports that I've been reading.

08:11.249 --> 08:12.616
Happen to be talking about...

08:12.649 --> 08:14.583
- That... just don't be so cocky...
- OK.

08:14.616 --> 08:17.449
...with houses, because it could
all turn around at any moment.

08:17.487 --> 08:18.813
- Yeah.
- That's what I've learned.

08:18.854 --> 08:21.748
Oh, my gosh. Having a wife
that's so successful...

08:21.789 --> 08:25.023
I mean, most men would be like,
"I can't handle it."

08:25.096 --> 08:26.663
I know this one
would be terrible.

08:26.696 --> 08:28.537
Look at the look in his eyes.
Look in his eyes.

08:28.560 --> 08:32.600
Yeah, I'll do the work,
you, you know, clean up.

08:32.633 --> 08:35.371
Oh, he's so supportive.
I mean, he really is.

08:35.404 --> 08:37.878
- Oh, so sweet, Kenny.
- You're like a nice big bra.

08:38.910 --> 08:40.918
You are not.

08:40.951 --> 08:42.414
I shouldn't tell jokes,
I'm not the jokester.

08:42.448 --> 08:43.952
- He is.
- I'm the joke man.

08:43.985 --> 08:46.626
- He does impressions.
- Oh, I love your impressions.

08:46.659 --> 08:49.132
- Do one for us.
- Do my mother. Do my mother.

08:49.165 --> 08:50.899
Oh, it's so funny
if you know her.

08:50.932 --> 08:52.793
You better watch yourself.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.433
You're spending too much money
on that house.

08:58.466 --> 09:01.043
It's exact.

09:01.076 --> 09:02.307
Well, you know what?
I can do impressions too.

09:02.340 --> 09:04.242
This is your guys kid,
the one you guys adopted.

09:04.275 --> 09:05.713
This is him.

09:06.913 --> 09:08.711
Hey, you guys don't look like
my parents.

09:08.744 --> 09:11.479
Where are my parents?
Where'd my mom and dad go?

09:11.512 --> 09:13.450
Right? This is funny.
This is your guys' kid.

09:13.483 --> 09:16.260
I wish you guys woulda left me
in Vietnam in the foxhole

09:16.293 --> 09:17.827
- instead of taking me here
- That's enough.

09:17.860 --> 09:20.290
- to be around everyone else...
- Kenny, that's enough.

09:20.323 --> 09:21.490
- Yes.
- That's enough.

09:57.550 --> 09:59.389
Muggy out, isn't it?

09:59.422 --> 10:01.357
Hey, once you're done in here,

10:01.390 --> 10:03.356
I need you to drop a Benz
in Charlotte.

10:03.390 --> 10:05.789
Oh, man. I'm gonna get
butt-fucked in traffic, dude.

10:05.830 --> 10:07.662
Charlotte on rush hour
on a Wednesday?

10:07.695 --> 10:09.000
Ask Derrick to do it.

10:09.033 --> 10:11.065
I ain't asking anybody.
I'm telling you, Ken.

10:11.106 --> 10:13.074
Man, I was hoping to get off
early tonight,

10:13.107 --> 10:14.337
my wife's getting honored
at an event.

10:19.472 --> 10:21.647
Ken.

10:21.680 --> 10:23.015
- Yes, Mark.
- Ken.

10:23.048 --> 10:24.614
- What?
- You happen to know

10:24.647 --> 10:27.076
who mushed the donuts
I brought in today?

10:27.117 --> 10:28.515
I mean, I broke a piece off.

10:28.548 --> 10:30.068
I wasn't trying to eat
the whole thing.

10:30.081 --> 10:32.914
No. I'm not talking about
breaking a piece off.

10:32.947 --> 10:36.092
I'm talking about somebody
who went in and methodically

10:36.125 --> 10:37.957
mushed the donuts.

10:37.990 --> 10:41.089
It's not like a donut
got mushed accidental.

10:41.122 --> 10:43.656
It was definitely
intentional mushing the donuts.

10:43.697 --> 10:45.865
Well, no. I didn't...
Why am I gonna mush donuts?

10:45.899 --> 10:47.129
I don't give a shit
about donuts.

10:47.162 --> 10:48.728
Well, you broke a piece off.

10:48.769 --> 10:49.863
Well, but that's just because
I'm trying to watch my weight

10:49.896 --> 10:51.599
I wasn't trying to eat
the whole thing.

10:51.632 --> 10:53.568
Maybe some people in this job
just don't wanna come in here

10:53.605 --> 10:56.306
and be seeing little gifts
just that don't mean nothing.

10:56.339 --> 10:58.476
That's peace offerings, man.

10:58.509 --> 10:59.949
Why... why does there have to
even be a peace offering?

10:59.984 --> 11:01.349
Maybe if people just treated
people right around here

11:01.382 --> 11:03.578
people wouldn't be trying to
have to give peace offerings.

11:03.618 --> 11:05.249
What are you
trying to tell me, Ken?

11:05.315 --> 11:06.314
What are you trying to ask me?

11:06.355 --> 11:07.754
I'm asking if you know
who mushed the donuts

11:07.787 --> 11:08.986
- I brought in.
- And what'd I tell you?

11:09.019 --> 11:10.923
I said no. I said
I broke a piece off.

11:10.956 --> 11:12.229
I'm trying to watch my figure.

11:13.565 --> 11:15.733
If you do hear anything,
let me know.

11:15.766 --> 11:18.531
Yeah. Good luck with your
investigation, inspector.

11:40.518 --> 11:41.715
You know I'm not gonna
steal anything.

11:41.748 --> 11:43.177
You don't really have to
wait out here with me.

11:43.210 --> 11:44.280
I'll be the judge of that.

11:44.313 --> 11:47.678
All right.

11:50.582 --> 11:52.052
There he is, come on.

11:52.085 --> 11:53.084
Hey.

11:53.117 --> 11:54.788
- Ah, shit.
- Hey, how are you?

11:54.821 --> 11:56.741
Is there any way we can just
sign this back here?

11:56.754 --> 11:58.319
No. Come on.

11:58.352 --> 12:00.783
Anna, what a pretty name.

12:01.953 --> 12:03.287
Kenny Powers.

12:03.320 --> 12:04.455
Guy Young.

12:04.488 --> 12:06.293
- Kenny fucking Powers.
- Hey.

12:06.326 --> 12:08.355
- What's up, champion?
- What's happening, man?

12:08.388 --> 12:09.754
- How you doing?
- My old teammate, my God.

12:09.795 --> 12:11.023
- Yeah.
- What's it been,

12:11.056 --> 12:13.056
- like, 15 years?
- Yeah, at least 15.

12:13.097 --> 12:14.961
- Not since Atlanta.
- Hotlanta, right?

12:14.994 --> 12:17.000
Mos def, mos def.

12:17.033 --> 12:19.030
I saw this guy fucking
drink firewater

12:19.063 --> 12:20.829
- out of a hooker's pussy.
- Yeah.

12:20.862 --> 12:21.994
- That's right.
- No joke.

12:22.027 --> 12:23.465
- I forgot about that.
- Right out of her pussy.

12:23.498 --> 12:24.697
- And then you fucked her.
- And then I fucked her, yeah.

12:24.730 --> 12:25.801
Made my dick sting a little,

12:25.834 --> 12:28.171
because of the firewater.

12:28.204 --> 12:30.002
- We were crazy back then, huh?
- I know.

12:30.035 --> 12:31.035
So what's happening here?

12:31.042 --> 12:32.039
You guys making a movie
or something?

12:32.072 --> 12:33.670
No, no. We're not
making a movie.

12:33.703 --> 12:35.402
I'm not a movie star.
We're making a TV show.

12:35.435 --> 12:36.666
I'm a TV star.

12:36.707 --> 12:39.074
- I do <i>Sports Sesh</i> over here.
- Oh, yeah. There's...

12:39.107 --> 12:41.305
- Wow. That's cool.
- It's a sports show.

12:41.338 --> 12:42.659
I'm not familiar
with the program.

12:42.674 --> 12:44.639
I don't really keep up with
the sporting world anymore.

12:44.672 --> 12:45.678
Hey. You got five minutes?

12:45.711 --> 12:47.507
I can give you
a Guy Young VIP tour.

12:47.540 --> 12:49.274
- Actually, I gotta...
- He's dropping off

12:49.307 --> 12:50.306
your rental car, Mr. Guy Young.

12:50.339 --> 12:52.179
What do you...
what are you...

12:52.214 --> 12:53.379
Why? You rent cars now?

12:53.412 --> 12:56.283
Uh, well, actually,
kind of more or less the CEO

12:56.316 --> 12:57.683
of like a rental car
corporation.

12:57.716 --> 12:59.786
Don't you have some paperwork
for him to sign?

13:00.881 --> 13:03.088
Uh, yes, Miss Pleasant, I do.

13:03.121 --> 13:06.088
Uh... so here's the forms.

13:06.122 --> 13:08.561
This is the other Kenny,
he's my assistant manager.

13:08.594 --> 13:10.263
So sign that,
right there's cool.

13:10.296 --> 13:12.492
- You also are gonna sign there.
- Right here?

13:12.525 --> 13:14.394
You gotta say that
the gas tank is full

13:14.427 --> 13:15.490
and if you don't bring it back
full then we will

13:15.531 --> 13:17.562
- charge you for it.
- Yeah, I usually

13:17.595 --> 13:19.930
- return it empty.
- OK. Suit yourself.

13:19.963 --> 13:21.834
TV star. Doesn't have
to worry about gas.

13:21.868 --> 13:23.804
There's your car.

13:23.837 --> 13:25.309
Thank you, buddy.
Hey, Kenny, before you go,

13:25.342 --> 13:28.243
I'm hosting this, um...
charity event

13:28.276 --> 13:30.105
at the Ballantyne Hotel
Friday night.

13:30.138 --> 13:31.744
It's a little upscale,
a little fancy.

13:31.777 --> 13:33.513
Not your cup of tea
but right afterwards

13:33.546 --> 13:35.917
there's an after-party. It's
gonna be off the fucking hook.

13:35.950 --> 13:37.788
I'm gonna bring some
of my guys from the show.

13:37.821 --> 13:39.252
We hit a little pinch
of vintage Kenny P.

13:39.285 --> 13:41.451
and it'll be 1998
all over again.

13:41.484 --> 13:42.691
- What do you say?
- Yeah.

13:42.724 --> 13:44.387
That does sound like
a good time, Guy,

13:44.428 --> 13:47.122
but, uh, walked away from the
party scene a few years ago.

13:47.163 --> 13:49.289
- I'm a family man now.
- Get the fuck out of here.

13:49.330 --> 13:50.595
- Back up.
- No, it's true.

13:50.625 --> 13:52.862
I'm... love my family.
I don't party anymore.

13:52.895 --> 13:54.726
Get out of here.
Shut up.

13:54.767 --> 13:56.462
The only drug I get off on
is my wife and kids

13:56.495 --> 13:58.901
and I get fucked up on them
every single night.

13:58.934 --> 14:01.364
What? I feel like
I'm looking at a dead man.

14:01.405 --> 14:04.140
I did die, and then
I was born again

14:04.173 --> 14:05.668
as a family man.

14:05.709 --> 14:07.436
Well, as long as
you're happy, Kenny.

14:07.477 --> 14:09.538
Thrilled.
Never been happier.

14:09.571 --> 14:10.904
Hey, get back to work,
all right?

14:10.937 --> 14:12.175
- You too.
- Listen,

14:12.208 --> 14:13.472
maybe I'll put you on the list,

14:13.513 --> 14:14.681
just in case
you change your mind.

14:14.714 --> 14:16.648
I wouldn't bother. I got
a corporate takeover

14:16.681 --> 14:18.601
I have to oversee,
so I'm not gonna be able to...

14:18.616 --> 14:20.416
I'm gonna put you
on the list anyway.

14:20.449 --> 14:22.184
- Good to see you, Guy.
- Good seeing you.

14:22.223 --> 14:23.888
- Take care of yourself.
- Who wants an autograph?

14:24.921 --> 14:27.224
Her charm,
her work ethic

14:27.257 --> 14:30.561
and her tireless spirit
make April the best agent

14:30.594 --> 14:33.593
I've ever worked with.
I'd truly be lost without her.

14:33.631 --> 14:36.363
So, without further ado,

14:36.396 --> 14:40.667
our MVP, the one and only...

14:40.700 --> 14:41.835
...April Powers.

14:44.974 --> 14:47.973
You like me,
you really like me.

14:49.406 --> 14:52.549
Well, first off, I just wanna
thank everyone that I work with.

14:52.646 --> 14:55.116
You have been so good to me.

14:55.149 --> 14:58.512
You have taught me the tools
that I have needed to succeed.

14:58.545 --> 15:03.251
But most of all,
I wanna thank my husband, Kenny,

15:03.292 --> 15:07.397
who has always been so
supportive of me no matter what.

15:12.025 --> 15:14.929
When I've been working late, you
know, he takes care of the kids,

15:14.962 --> 15:17.130
cleaning the poopy diapers...

15:17.171 --> 15:19.106
...singing lullabies.

15:19.139 --> 15:23.073
Cooking for them. He has become
quite the little cook.

15:24.873 --> 15:27.144
Also, when it's just been
a rough day,

15:27.177 --> 15:30.208
I'm excited to go home because
I know that there is a back rub

15:30.249 --> 15:32.313
and a bubble bath
waiting for me.

15:32.346 --> 15:35.354
Aww.

15:35.387 --> 15:40.289
So thank you for standing
right behind me.

15:41.459 --> 15:44.626
You truly are
my wonderful husband.

16:01.718 --> 16:02.813
Fuck!

16:04.319 --> 16:06.056
Shit! Fuck you!

16:06.090 --> 16:08.163
Cunt! Shit!

16:08.196 --> 16:10.533
Shit! Crap fucking shit!

16:10.566 --> 16:12.132
- Goddamn it!
- There you are.

16:12.165 --> 16:14.570
I was looking for you.
What is wrong?

16:14.603 --> 16:16.971
Nothing. Just that place
smells bad inside.

16:17.004 --> 16:18.508
Smells like dog shit
and potstickers.

16:18.541 --> 16:20.214
Trying to get some fresh air.

16:20.247 --> 16:22.416
Kenny, what is going on?
You can tell me.

16:22.481 --> 16:24.815
I don't know.

16:24.848 --> 16:28.317
Just sitting in there and
everyone's clapping for you.

16:28.351 --> 16:30.222
Must think of me
like some kind of dipshit.

16:30.255 --> 16:32.359
I feel like
fucking Tim Robbins in there.

16:32.392 --> 16:34.794
Everyone's smiling at me,
bitching me out.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.268
So because I'm
achieving something

16:36.301 --> 16:38.164
- that makes you a bitch?
- Yes, April.

16:38.205 --> 16:40.325
Every single morning I wake up,
I think about the fact

16:40.341 --> 16:42.404
that I fucking walked away
from baseball.

16:42.437 --> 16:45.373
I gotta suck my fucking soul in,
put a smile on my face.

16:45.414 --> 16:47.677
Go about my day.

16:50.613 --> 16:53.116
You have so much
to be proud of.

16:53.149 --> 16:55.148
Like what?
My shitty job?

16:55.189 --> 16:58.022
- Our lame ass friends?
- Your kids.

16:58.055 --> 16:59.328
Well, Shayna's pretty cool

16:59.361 --> 17:01.160
but she's never gonna be
a ball player.

17:01.193 --> 17:03.599
Toby. Always trying to
challenge my authority.

17:03.632 --> 17:05.367
Little motherfucker thinks
he's the head of the household.

17:05.401 --> 17:06.367
Fuck him.

17:06.433 --> 17:08.537
You think it's easy for me?

17:08.569 --> 17:10.371
Watching you mope
around the house.

17:10.412 --> 17:12.339
Mope. Ain't nobody moping.

17:12.380 --> 17:14.412
You know what?

17:14.444 --> 17:16.348
I'm gonna go in there.

17:16.382 --> 17:19.422
And I'm gonna try
to enjoy myself.

17:19.454 --> 17:22.328
And I hope you will join me.

17:28.568 --> 17:30.735
April.

17:30.768 --> 17:33.136
I'm gonna stay out here
in silent protest.

17:33.169 --> 17:36.103
But perhaps you could grab me
some of those chili sliders,

17:36.135 --> 17:39.240
that'd be very baller.
Maybe some napkins.

17:39.273 --> 17:40.577
Arnold Palmer.

17:42.213 --> 17:44.485
Actually, April.

17:44.518 --> 17:46.486
You know what, scratch
the Arnold Palmer.

17:46.519 --> 17:47.926
Just make it a lemonade.

18:20.148 --> 18:22.116
<i>That's ridiculous,</i>
<i>all right. Let's be honest,</i>

18:22.149 --> 18:24.486
<i>I mean, there are already</i>
<i>gay athletes in the league.</i>

18:24.519 --> 18:26.919
<i>Just 'cause they're not vocal</i>
<i>doesn't mean they're not there.</i>

18:26.922 --> 18:28.394
<i>I know Dontel</i>
<i>ain't about that life.</i>

18:28.427 --> 18:29.762
<i>Are you afraid it's contagious?</i>

18:29.795 --> 18:31.427
<i>I damn sure</i>
<i>ain't gonna find out.</i>

18:31.468 --> 18:33.364
<i>No. Way. Boy.</i>

18:38.779 --> 18:40.746
I just want you
to take a second, OK,

18:40.779 --> 18:44.418
and just imagine that
you're sitting in a dugout

18:44.451 --> 18:46.250
and you're looking
across the field

18:46.283 --> 18:48.387
and who's there,
in the other dugout,

18:48.420 --> 18:50.757
is AIDS.
A team of AIDS.

18:50.790 --> 18:55.370
Baseball cap on and a uniform.
All skinny with lesions.

18:55.403 --> 18:57.370
Saying I wanna get in you.

18:57.403 --> 19:00.376
I wanna get my AIDS
right up in you.

19:00.409 --> 19:01.840
I wanna give this man AIDS.

19:01.873 --> 19:03.311
I wanna give
this beautiful woman AIDS.

19:03.344 --> 19:04.909
I wanna give this
whole table AIDS.

19:04.941 --> 19:07.708
Well, not on my watch.
Not on Guy Young's watch.

19:07.742 --> 19:11.886
We're not gonna let AIDS
get more hits than us.

19:11.919 --> 19:14.920
We're not gonna let AIDS
strike out more people than us.

19:14.954 --> 19:16.289
No, sir. Not on my watch.

19:16.322 --> 19:19.791
Let's take out our checkbooks.
Let's take out our wallets.

19:19.824 --> 19:21.160
And let's all be heroes together

19:21.193 --> 19:24.202
and win the World Series
against AIDS.

19:24.235 --> 19:25.972
OK?

19:26.005 --> 19:27.268
Let's find a cure.

19:30.444 --> 19:33.410
Let's find a cure for AIDS.

19:35.813 --> 19:37.082
Shit, dude. An AIDS charity.

19:37.115 --> 19:39.248
I mean, that's a fucking
pretty big deal.

19:39.281 --> 19:42.111
Yeah, man. All the top dogs
have their own AIDS charities.

19:42.152 --> 19:44.950
I mean, war torn countries
and natural disasters,

19:44.983 --> 19:48.023
they come and go but the AID
train keeps on rollin'.

19:48.056 --> 19:49.422
You're a good fit for AIDS, man.
I'm happy for you.

19:49.455 --> 19:51.188
- That's awesome.
- Thank you. Hey, Jed.

19:51.221 --> 19:52.692
Bring the boys over.

19:52.725 --> 19:55.858
Kenny Powers, I want you to meet
my <i>Sports Sesh</i> cohorts.

19:55.891 --> 19:58.593
Three time Winston Cup champion,
Jed Forney.

19:58.626 --> 19:59.625
Hall of Fame linebacker,
Jimmy Clay.

19:59.658 --> 20:01.329
And last but not least,

20:01.362 --> 20:03.526
former heavyweight champion
of the world,

20:03.559 --> 20:05.994
- Ronny "The Hammer" Garcia.
- Nice to meet you.

20:06.027 --> 20:07.192
Holy shit.
Well, you boys didn't forget

20:07.225 --> 20:09.788
to eat your Wheaties, huh?

20:09.821 --> 20:11.360
Hey, you boys ready
to pop some champ?

20:11.388 --> 20:12.395
- Yeah. Hell yeah.
- Sure.

20:12.428 --> 20:13.563
Because I put in
my brownie points,

20:13.596 --> 20:15.393
now I'm ready to point
some brownies.

20:16.930 --> 20:18.991
Wha-wha-what does
point some brownies mean?

20:19.032 --> 20:21.029
- Fuck some ladies in the ass.
- Hey!

20:45.245 --> 20:47.476
Hey, another round of shots.

20:47.517 --> 20:49.946
- Coconut Ciroc, all around.
- Whoo! Man.

20:49.979 --> 20:52.313
- Big fucking spender.
- That's so much money.

20:52.346 --> 20:55.078
Shit, man. I'm bippin' daily.

20:55.111 --> 20:58.149
Man, I haven't been to a VIP
joint like this in a long time.

20:58.182 --> 20:59.517
It's been a while.
Thank you very much.

20:59.550 --> 21:02.388
Hey, don't get it twisted.
We splittin' the check now.

21:02.421 --> 21:04.756
I actually only had two
sexes on beaches.

21:04.789 --> 21:07.124
Stop actin' like a little bitch,
Kenny. You know you rich.

21:07.157 --> 21:08.691
Yeah, I'm rich.

21:08.724 --> 21:11.090
Hey, I'll pay for Kenny.
Hell, I got so much money

21:11.131 --> 21:12.226
I don't even
know what to do with it.

21:12.259 --> 21:13.739
Hey, this bastard
making all that bank

21:13.762 --> 21:16.160
selling doo-doo chicken
to the poor folk.

21:16.201 --> 21:18.733
Hey, don't be jealous
of my chicken chain.

21:18.766 --> 21:20.458
Ain't nobody jealous of your
wack-ass chicken chain.

21:20.499 --> 21:22.298
Shit, you know that chicken
nasty as a motherfucker

21:22.331 --> 21:24.003
if my black ass
won't even eat that shit.

21:24.036 --> 21:25.236
Ah, shit!

21:25.269 --> 21:27.100
He's black and he won't
eat the chicken.

21:27.141 --> 21:28.467
Somebody's buying it.

21:28.508 --> 21:31.670
Hey, Guy, tell him what you got.

21:31.703 --> 21:32.735
Oh, you wanna know what I got?

21:32.768 --> 21:33.775
I'll tell you what I got.

21:33.808 --> 21:36.175
I got...
I got two Regal Cinemas.

21:36.209 --> 21:38.608
I got a Napa Auto Parts.
I got eight Sbarros.

21:38.653 --> 21:40.847
I got I don't know
how many Subways.

21:40.880 --> 21:42.909
Hey, Kenny, tell 'em what you
got. Tell 'em what you got.

21:42.950 --> 21:45.380
- Don't hold back now.
- Yeah.

21:45.413 --> 21:49.284
I got a modest priced home.
I got a good deal on it.

21:49.317 --> 21:51.083
- That's nice.
- Yeah.

21:51.116 --> 21:52.850
What else, what else?
What else you got? Come on now.

21:52.891 --> 21:56.689
Oh... I got a family
that loves me.

21:56.722 --> 21:58.288
Loves the fuck outta me.

21:58.321 --> 22:00.326
Like, they like,
they really like me a lot.

22:00.359 --> 22:01.926
- Seriously though,
- What the fuck is that?

22:01.959 --> 22:03.262
like, something real.
What you got?

22:03.295 --> 22:07.261
I'm about to get a pool.

22:07.294 --> 22:08.500
I love pools!

22:08.533 --> 22:10.466
Hey, I swim in my pool
every motherfucking day.

22:10.499 --> 22:13.328
- Whoo! Pool! Pools!
- Pools! Pools!

22:18.231 --> 22:20.038
I'm gonna get a big
motherfucking pool!

22:20.101 --> 22:22.298
Hey, let's all dance!

22:59.552 --> 23:01.918
Please eat your cereal,
I'm not playing around.

23:01.951 --> 23:03.191
I need you to eat it right now.

23:03.224 --> 23:04.655
- Hey, that's mine!
- No, we're not gonna run

23:04.728 --> 23:06.094
in the house, please.

23:06.127 --> 23:08.430
Toby, I need you to give her
her iPad back, please.

23:08.463 --> 23:10.964
Let's bring the sound down
just a decibel, please.

23:10.997 --> 23:13.697
- Good morning.
- Hey, good morning.

23:13.729 --> 23:15.231
- Late night, huh?
- I guess.

23:15.264 --> 23:17.398
- Hey, where's the aspirin at?
- Right there.

23:17.431 --> 23:20.029
- Here?
- Mm-hmm. In that drawer.

23:20.062 --> 23:22.364
- The coffee's ready.
- Nice.

23:22.397 --> 23:25.130
- And you got this.
- Hmm?

23:27.139 --> 23:28.570
Toby, please get ready
for school.

23:28.602 --> 23:30.274
I'm not gonna say it again.

23:39.344 --> 23:41.246
Goddamn it.

23:53.823 --> 23:55.694
Look at this guy.
This is the guy from before.

23:55.727 --> 23:58.831
Look at his little Sebring.

23:58.870 --> 24:00.135
Hey, I like that Sebring, bro.

24:00.168 --> 24:02.566
Oh, my God.

24:02.599 --> 24:04.838
He is a real loser.

24:36.477 --> 24:38.707
It's not nice
to call people faggots.

24:39.908 --> 24:41.610
Faggots.

25:33.160 --> 25:35.156
This motherfucker's crazy.

25:45.236 --> 25:47.000
What the fuck was that shit?

26:00.411 --> 26:02.409
OMFNG.

26:02.442 --> 26:05.816
Look at that body damage.
This is structural.

26:05.849 --> 26:06.880
What happened here?

26:06.913 --> 26:08.951
Shit, Mark. Shit happened.

26:08.984 --> 26:10.783
Just like the saying goes.

26:10.816 --> 26:12.718
And I didn't fill it up
with gas, either.

26:12.751 --> 26:15.285
Well, I'm gonna need
a full report.

26:15.318 --> 26:17.328
You... gonna have
to do the paperwork.

26:17.361 --> 26:18.825
Your laws mean nothing to me.

26:18.859 --> 26:21.561
Last night I had a taste
of the A-list.

26:21.594 --> 26:25.569
And it reminded me of something
I've known for a very long time.

26:25.602 --> 26:27.106
I'm better than you.

26:27.139 --> 26:30.369
This little fucking parking lot
here, this may be your kingdom,

26:30.410 --> 26:32.502
your legacy.
It's a piss in the pool to me.

26:32.535 --> 26:35.270
From this moment forward
I'm getting what's mine.

26:35.311 --> 26:38.419
Fame, money, respect,
chicken chains.

26:38.449 --> 26:41.881
And if you doubt that,
all of you can suck my nuts.

26:41.914 --> 26:43.449
Suck on them so fucking hard

26:43.490 --> 26:45.488
you can't even breath
through your mouth,

26:45.520 --> 26:48.116
only through your nose,
but it'll be even hard to do

26:48.149 --> 26:50.881
'cause my fucking fat dick
will be clogging that shit.

26:50.922 --> 26:54.952
I'm no longer some slack-jawed
dipshit that rents cars.

26:54.985 --> 26:58.255
Now I'm just back to just being
a regular to who I am.

26:58.288 --> 27:00.328
You wanna fucking air battle,
bitch?

27:00.361 --> 27:01.862
Let's fucking air battle, huh.

27:01.895 --> 27:03.830
Come on, man.

27:03.863 --> 27:04.926
- You like that?
- Don't fake punch me.

27:04.967 --> 27:06.662
Come on. Put up
some fucking defenses.

27:06.695 --> 27:08.365
Don't air punch me.

27:08.398 --> 27:10.269
You're not doing it
good naturedly.

27:10.302 --> 27:12.037
Stop, man.

27:14.174 --> 27:15.341
You just connected, man.

27:15.374 --> 27:17.005
OK, I know. That last one
got away from me.

27:17.038 --> 27:19.412
But that is what happens when
people get into air battles.

27:19.445 --> 27:21.612
Sometimes they connect, Mark.

27:21.645 --> 27:22.915
Sometimes they connect.

27:24.644 --> 27:26.683
I quit.
