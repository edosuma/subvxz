WEBVTT

05:20.710 --> 05:21.626
Hmm.

05:31.042 --> 05:32.584
You have a visitor,
Mr. Delos.

05:32.668 --> 05:34.084
Shall I send him in?

05:35.334 --> 05:37.001
'Bout time.

05:53.751 --> 05:55.084
William, m'boy.

05:55.167 --> 05:57.209
Where the hell
have you been?

05:57.292 --> 05:58.793
It's good to see you again, Jim.

06:01.084 --> 06:03.209
Thank fuck for that.

06:03.292 --> 06:05.626
Most potent thing
these cretins'll give me

06:05.710 --> 06:07.001
is grapefruit juice.

06:20.292 --> 06:22.668
It's a little early
for me.

06:24.167 --> 06:26.584
A little fuckin' late,
you mean.

06:26.668 --> 06:29.918
Besides, if you aim
to cheat the devil,

06:30.001 --> 06:31.960
you owe him an offering.

06:37.626 --> 06:39.418
So...

06:39.501 --> 06:41.251
when can I get out of here?

06:41.334 --> 06:42.918
Soon.

06:43.001 --> 06:44.960
The observation period
is almost over,

06:45.042 --> 06:48.459
and the last step
is a baseline interview.

06:48.543 --> 06:50.543
It's, uh, it's a conversation

06:50.626 --> 06:53.292
that'll give 'em
something to refer back to.

06:53.376 --> 06:57.501
All right. Well,
let's get on with it!

06:57.584 --> 07:00.126
This is  the interview.

07:00.209 --> 07:03.251
The thinking is, it should
be conducted by someone
that's familiar to you,

07:03.334 --> 07:04.876
a friendly face.

07:04.960 --> 07:06.835
It's about capturing
your frame of mind,

07:06.918 --> 07:08.876
your mood,
your sense of humor.

07:08.960 --> 07:11.126
I own a biotechnology
company,

07:11.209 --> 07:14.042
and I'm dying of a disease
whose research

07:14.126 --> 07:16.835
I defunded 15 years ago.

07:16.918 --> 07:20.042
I think my sense of humor
is fuckin' intact.

07:20.126 --> 07:24.126
My patience,
on the other hand...

07:24.209 --> 07:26.251
Fair enough.

07:26.334 --> 07:28.209
I'm gonna ask you
a couple of questions.

07:31.292 --> 07:33.543
Do you know where
you are?

07:33.626 --> 07:36.418
Carlsbad, California,

07:36.501 --> 07:40.876
in some office park
I'm probably overpaying for,

07:40.960 --> 07:43.584
along with the rest
of this fucking endeavor.

07:43.668 --> 07:44.876
And how long you been here?

07:44.960 --> 07:47.501
Far too fuckin' long already.

07:47.584 --> 07:50.001
I've got a business to run.

07:50.084 --> 07:52.626
What is the purpose
of these questions?

07:52.710 --> 07:56.501
Like I said, they're just
trying to establish a baseline.

07:56.584 --> 07:57.710
For what?!

07:57.793 --> 08:00.126
Fidelity.

08:01.918 --> 08:04.334
So, what's the idea?

08:04.418 --> 08:09.376
That afterwards
you and I have
the exact same conversation?

08:11.001 --> 08:14.084
It seems a little far-fetched,
doesn't it, William?

08:39.918 --> 08:43.876
No whiskey, no tobacco,
low on ammo--

08:43.960 --> 08:45.626
wherever it is
you're takin' me,

08:45.710 --> 08:47.292
we best get there soon.

09:32.835 --> 09:35.084
Let me go! No!

09:35.167 --> 09:37.001
What are you doing?!

09:52.584 --> 09:55.292
These tracks
are supposed to head north,

09:55.376 --> 09:56.918
not west.

09:57.001 --> 10:00.960
Seems like Ford's game
has multiple contenders.

10:01.042 --> 10:05.126
Plus it detours through
Las Mudas.

10:05.209 --> 10:08.167
What, that two-bit town?
There are better places to--

10:08.251 --> 10:10.209
Oh, cut the crap, Lawrence.

10:10.292 --> 10:13.042
I know you have family there.

10:13.126 --> 10:16.042
Looks like Ford's
arranging a reunion.

10:42.334 --> 10:44.668
Clementine.

10:44.751 --> 10:47.209
Where are we?

11:13.960 --> 11:15.501
Hello?

11:15.584 --> 11:16.793
Who's there?

11:37.126 --> 11:38.209
Elsie?

11:38.292 --> 11:40.251
Are you fucking kidding me?

11:40.334 --> 11:42.251
Stay the hell
away from me.

12:01.334 --> 12:02.668
You're OK--

12:04.251 --> 12:05.793
Don't move.

12:05.876 --> 12:08.167
I'm not gonna hurt you,
Else.

12:08.251 --> 12:09.751
It's too late for that,
asshole.

12:09.835 --> 12:11.960
You choked me out
and you left me here

12:12.042 --> 12:14.167
with a bunch of fuckin'
protein bars and a bucket.

12:14.251 --> 12:15.334
It wasn't me.

12:15.418 --> 12:17.710
It was Ford. He forced me.

12:17.793 --> 12:19.167
Oh, he forced you?

12:19.251 --> 12:21.084
You knew too much.

12:21.167 --> 12:22.835
He couldn't risk
you stopping him.

12:22.918 --> 12:24.543
Stopping him from what?

12:24.626 --> 12:28.418
Ford wrote a g-game,
and we're all in it.

12:28.501 --> 12:31.376
Now all the hosts are free,

12:31.459 --> 12:33.042
with no constraints,

12:33.126 --> 12:34.918
n-n-no safeguards.

12:35.001 --> 12:36.209
What are you talking about?

12:37.710 --> 12:39.292
P-Please. Please.

12:39.376 --> 12:41.251
What the hell
is wrong with you?

12:41.334 --> 12:44.376
Please. P-P-Please.

12:44.459 --> 12:46.459
Elsie, please.

12:46.543 --> 12:47.751
Please.

12:49.042 --> 12:50.376
No. Hey.

12:54.501 --> 12:56.626
Elsie, p-p-please.

12:56.710 --> 12:58.668
T-T-Tablet.

13:04.459 --> 13:07.835
Cognitive... l-l-lock.

13:20.918 --> 13:22.918
But you--

13:23.001 --> 13:26.126
You rotated out.

13:26.209 --> 13:29.501
Where did you go
when you rotated out?

13:29.584 --> 13:34.876
You have a family.
You have an ex-wife.

13:34.960 --> 13:37.584
You have...

13:37.668 --> 13:40.084
a backstory.

13:40.167 --> 13:41.501
Shh-- Shh--

13:41.584 --> 13:44.501
Shutting... down.

13:44.584 --> 13:47.209
- Shh-- Shh--
- OK. OK.

13:48.584 --> 13:51.668
I can-- I can detask
your systems,

13:51.751 --> 13:54.376
put you in safe mode.

13:55.918 --> 13:57.876
And don't worry.

13:57.960 --> 13:59.793
I'm not gonna brick you,
asshole.

13:59.876 --> 14:02.793
Not yet. You got
too much shit to answer for.

14:02.876 --> 14:06.876
OK. You're gonna be out

14:06.960 --> 14:08.251
in three...

14:08.334 --> 14:11.251
two...

14:11.334 --> 14:12.501
one.

14:47.334 --> 14:50.251
Is this now?

14:50.334 --> 14:53.960
You have extensive
cortical damage.

14:54.042 --> 14:57.751
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say you shot yourself.

14:57.835 --> 15:01.584
I altered your code to ignore
the physical damage for now,

15:01.668 --> 15:05.835
but you're not gonna last long
without cortical fluid.

15:13.209 --> 15:14.418
With any luck,

15:14.501 --> 15:17.001
you'll survive till
they call in the cavalry.

15:22.418 --> 15:24.376
Elsie, wait!

15:25.876 --> 15:27.376
Elsie.

15:28.835 --> 15:29.918
Wait.

15:32.042 --> 15:35.042
No one's coming
for any of us.

15:35.126 --> 15:38.459
- Delos doesn't want them to.
- What? Why?

15:38.543 --> 15:42.167
There's something here.
Something they've been
working on a long time.

15:42.251 --> 15:45.626
Delos won't call in the rescue
until they've ensured
it's safe.

15:45.710 --> 15:47.793
Elsie, please.

15:47.876 --> 15:49.626
I won't last
without cortical fluid.

15:49.710 --> 15:52.209
Even if I wanted to,

15:52.292 --> 15:54.251
we don't have any tools.

15:54.334 --> 15:58.167
We're in Sector 22. I mean,
there's nothing out here
for miles.

16:04.918 --> 16:06.835
Bernard?

16:06.918 --> 16:09.126
What the hell
are you looking at?

16:30.626 --> 16:33.918
Bernard. What the hell
is wrong with you?

16:35.459 --> 16:37.918
There's a facility here.

16:40.543 --> 16:42.793
- What?
- I think Ford

16:42.876 --> 16:45.793
had Clementine bring me here
for a reason.

17:01.084 --> 17:02.501
I told you, there's--

17:02.584 --> 17:05.084
there's really nothing
around here for miles.

17:05.167 --> 17:06.751
It's hidden.

17:06.835 --> 17:09.001
It's part of their project.

17:26.167 --> 17:28.001
What the hell is that?

17:44.668 --> 17:46.668
Where does that go,
Bernard?

17:49.835 --> 17:51.543
I don't remember.

18:36.042 --> 18:37.251
It's a whole lab.

18:51.668 --> 18:53.584
What the hell happened here?

18:59.292 --> 19:00.501
Oh, my God.

19:00.584 --> 19:02.626
This is a control unit printer.

19:03.751 --> 19:05.876
What are they doing with this?

19:40.918 --> 19:42.209
Bernard.

19:43.376 --> 19:44.459
What the fuck is that?

19:47.418 --> 19:49.751
Don't threaten it
and it won't hurt you.

20:01.668 --> 20:04.710
What the hell
were they doing here?

20:04.793 --> 20:07.584
I think they were
watching the guests.

20:09.793 --> 20:11.710
What would they want
with the guests?

20:13.334 --> 20:15.418
Great. Cortical fluid.

20:15.501 --> 20:16.543
OK.

20:27.084 --> 20:29.459
Please.

20:29.543 --> 20:31.543
Bernard.

20:31.626 --> 20:34.501
Did you have something to do
with this project?

20:36.710 --> 20:37.918
I don't know.

20:38.001 --> 20:40.376
I don't think so.

20:40.459 --> 20:42.334
Is Ford in control
of you now?

20:44.835 --> 20:46.292
Ford's dead.

20:48.459 --> 20:49.960
Fuck me.

20:52.042 --> 20:53.042
OK.

20:53.126 --> 20:54.793
OK, stay with me, Bernard.

20:54.876 --> 20:55.835
Stay with me.

21:02.668 --> 21:03.835
This is gonna hurt.

21:21.042 --> 21:24.084
This can't be happening
because none of this
is real, right?

21:24.167 --> 21:27.751
It's gonna be OK.
Someone'll rescue us.

21:27.835 --> 21:32.001
Seems to me like our rescue's
in the same boat we are.

21:38.334 --> 21:40.251
Unhh!

21:56.126 --> 21:57.626
She said "time is coming,"

21:57.710 --> 21:59.751
or something "is coming."

21:59.835 --> 22:01.751
You've spent enough time
in the park

22:01.835 --> 22:03.751
to learn the language?

22:05.876 --> 22:08.835
A lot of people
tend to ignore
their narratives.

22:08.918 --> 22:10.793
I don't like other people
very much.

22:10.876 --> 22:14.209
I've been watching 'em
since they ambushed me, and...

22:14.292 --> 22:17.167
they keep the humans close,
but they're not killin' us--
just the hosts.

22:17.251 --> 22:20.251
No offense, but I'm not
gonna stick around
to test that theory.

22:20.334 --> 22:21.751
Safer to wait for
the first responders.

22:21.835 --> 22:24.543
There's a protocol
for evacuation.

22:24.626 --> 22:26.167
They'll get you out of here.

22:26.251 --> 22:28.001
Thanks.

22:28.084 --> 22:29.584
But, uh...

22:29.668 --> 22:32.126
I'm not looking
to get out of here.

22:38.334 --> 22:40.668
Home, sweet home,
Lawrence.

22:56.167 --> 22:57.793
Where the hell
is everybody?

23:14.876 --> 23:16.376
Whiskey.

23:16.459 --> 23:18.459
Nothin' fancy.

23:22.001 --> 23:25.084
You don't seem too happy
to be home, Lawrence.

23:25.167 --> 23:27.334
I've never been
the domestic type.

23:27.418 --> 23:30.960
By some fluke of nature
I got myself
a wife and a daughter

23:31.042 --> 23:32.710
who think I hung the moon.

23:32.793 --> 23:36.835
Truth is,
I'm a son of a bitch.

23:36.918 --> 23:39.668
Kindest thing I ever did
was to keep away.

23:44.042 --> 23:46.835
The Gran Reserva.
Only for our most
distinguished guest.

23:49.459 --> 23:51.126
Hey, hey, hey.

23:51.209 --> 23:53.710
I haven't even
shot anybody yet.

23:53.793 --> 23:55.751
What's your problem?

24:06.918 --> 24:10.543
You harbor even
the faintest ambition
of using that thing

24:10.626 --> 24:14.876
and I'll turn that pretty face
of yours inside-out.

24:24.126 --> 24:26.292
Someone took a chunk
out of you boys.

24:26.376 --> 24:29.668
What happened
to the rest of you?

24:29.751 --> 24:31.793
Double-crossed...

24:31.876 --> 24:33.626
by some bitch name of Wyatt.

24:35.584 --> 24:37.459
- Good for her.
- On your feet.

24:44.793 --> 24:46.501
Go on. In here.

24:59.126 --> 25:00.084
Papa!

25:01.251 --> 25:02.751
Ah, mija.

25:08.668 --> 25:12.084
Now, me and my men here

25:12.167 --> 25:14.626
have a long journey
ahead of us.

25:16.501 --> 25:17.459
Mm.

25:17.543 --> 25:20.835
We need food, whiskey,

25:20.918 --> 25:22.668
and ammunition.

25:22.751 --> 25:25.209
You people have
some village elder

25:25.292 --> 25:26.543
who can speak for you?

25:26.626 --> 25:28.960
Make some kind of a deal?

25:48.668 --> 25:52.459
I ain't interested
in makin' fuckin' deals.

25:52.543 --> 25:55.292
You understand?

25:58.209 --> 26:00.167
We know you motherfuckers
are rebels.

26:03.668 --> 26:06.084
So you're gonna tell me
where the fuck

26:06.167 --> 26:09.001
you hid your weapons,
or you're gonna die.

26:09.084 --> 26:11.167
The second we tell him

26:11.251 --> 26:13.876
he's gonna kill us all
anyway.

26:20.334 --> 26:21.668
They got my family.

26:22.835 --> 26:24.334
My daughter.

26:26.459 --> 26:28.668
You told me
you had a daughter.

26:34.376 --> 26:35.418
Did I?

26:35.501 --> 26:38.960
I don't know.
At some point.

26:39.042 --> 26:43.668
You ain't exactly
forthcoming...

26:43.751 --> 26:45.835
but I remember that much.

26:47.710 --> 26:49.668
The point is,

26:49.751 --> 26:54.042
you think she'd want
to watch you gunned down
in front of her?

26:56.042 --> 26:57.876
Probably.

27:00.710 --> 27:02.876
Well, I'm not gonna
fuckin' die here.

27:02.960 --> 27:05.543
We just need to get
the weapons.

27:08.418 --> 27:10.418
You know where they are?

27:10.501 --> 27:13.876
They're in an unmarked grave
out back.

27:15.167 --> 27:17.126
We'll wait
till they're drunk,

27:17.209 --> 27:18.501
make a run for it.

27:18.584 --> 27:20.543
Sound like a plan?

27:23.918 --> 27:25.251
Yeah.

27:29.626 --> 27:30.876
What the fuck are you doin'?

27:30.960 --> 27:32.001
You.

27:34.209 --> 27:36.584
Let's make a deal.

27:40.292 --> 27:44.501
The weapons are in
an unmarked grave
behind the church.

27:44.584 --> 27:47.584
For a man who wants to deal,
you ain't very proficient at it.

27:47.668 --> 27:49.543
Supposed to set the terms

27:49.626 --> 27:50.876
before you give up what you got.

27:50.960 --> 27:52.751
That's not
what I'm offering.

27:52.835 --> 27:53.793
Hmm.

27:53.876 --> 27:56.334
I know something
you don't.

27:56.418 --> 27:59.292
I know where you're goin'.

27:59.376 --> 28:03.459
You've been telling your men
you know...

28:03.543 --> 28:05.084
but you don't.

28:05.167 --> 28:10.042
Just someplace you think
your dreams are comin' true

28:10.126 --> 28:12.960
and you call it Glory, but...

28:13.042 --> 28:15.418
it's got a lot of names.

28:17.751 --> 28:19.459
And I know the way.

28:24.960 --> 28:27.292
Go check the graveyard.

29:38.835 --> 29:40.876
You have a visitor, sir.

29:42.501 --> 29:44.167
'Bout time.

30:01.209 --> 30:03.251
William, m'boy.

30:03.334 --> 30:05.626
Where the hell
have you been?

30:05.710 --> 30:07.876
It's good to see you again, Jim.

30:15.042 --> 30:16.835
A little early for me.

30:16.918 --> 30:18.960
A little fuckin' late,
you mean.

30:20.292 --> 30:23.376
Besides, you aim
to cheat the devil,

30:23.459 --> 30:25.543
you owe him an offering.

30:26.876 --> 30:28.084
Ahh.

30:30.710 --> 30:33.334
What is the purpose
of these questions?

30:33.418 --> 30:35.459
Like I said,
they're just trying

30:35.543 --> 30:37.001
to establish a baseline.

30:37.084 --> 30:39.001
For what?

30:39.084 --> 30:40.960
Fidelity.

30:42.501 --> 30:46.543
So... what's the idea?

30:46.626 --> 30:48.459
That afterwards,

30:48.543 --> 30:50.459
we'd have the exact same
conversation?

30:50.543 --> 30:55.668
Seems a a little far-fetched,
doesn't it, William?

30:55.751 --> 30:57.751
It did... at first.

31:43.751 --> 31:46.042
And here I thought...

31:46.126 --> 31:48.835
you were just
pissin' away my money.

31:53.126 --> 31:55.459
You little fucking chancer.

31:57.334 --> 31:59.751
I take it I didn't recover.

31:59.835 --> 32:01.835
I'm afraid not.

32:05.209 --> 32:06.334
How long's it been?

32:06.418 --> 32:08.459
Seven years.

32:08.543 --> 32:10.584
Give or take.

32:19.543 --> 32:23.042
I'm not in California
anymore, am I?

32:23.126 --> 32:26.209
If you can't tell,
does it matter?

32:32.751 --> 32:34.835
So...

32:34.918 --> 32:39.084
let's get me
the fuck out of here!

32:40.751 --> 32:42.668
I am ready...

32:42.751 --> 32:45.167
to smoke my cigars,

32:45.251 --> 32:47.418
sail my boat,
fuck my wife.

32:53.668 --> 32:57.835
I take it that last part
isn't an option.

32:57.918 --> 32:59.418
I'm afraid not.

33:02.459 --> 33:04.042
What did her in?

33:04.126 --> 33:06.126
It was a stroke.

33:08.084 --> 33:10.418
Juliet had her buried
in the family plot.

33:14.584 --> 33:18.334
Juliet.
You're lookin' after her?

33:18.418 --> 33:19.668
Yeah.

33:19.751 --> 33:22.001
And my granddaughter,
she-- she--

33:22.084 --> 33:23.918
She's whip-smart.

33:24.001 --> 33:25.960
- Capable.
- Ouff.

33:44.001 --> 33:47.084
I assume my house
is ready for me?

33:49.334 --> 33:53.376
I'm afraid it's not that...
simple, Jim. We--

33:53.459 --> 33:56.876
We're gonna need
to keep you here
just a little bit longer.

33:56.960 --> 33:58.626
OK? For some observation.

33:58.710 --> 34:02.876
These fuckers have poked
and prodded me ad infinitum.

34:02.960 --> 34:04.626
Yeah, but we don't
want to rush it.

34:04.710 --> 34:06.167
We don't want
to wear you out.

34:06.251 --> 34:10.209
Wear me out?
I feel fuckin' brand-new.

34:10.292 --> 34:13.292
I am ready to get out there

34:13.376 --> 34:15.042
and see the sun.

34:15.126 --> 34:17.543
Get some fresh aid--

34:20.626 --> 34:21.543
Air.

34:24.459 --> 34:25.626
Get some--

34:28.042 --> 34:29.668
Get back to--

34:34.334 --> 34:35.918
Mmm--

34:36.001 --> 34:37.501
I'll come back tomorrow.

34:39.167 --> 34:40.459
Hmmp.

34:43.126 --> 34:44.751
You come--

34:44.835 --> 34:46.042
Yeah.

34:46.126 --> 34:47.501
In the--

34:47.584 --> 34:50.001
It's good to have you back,
Jim.

35:13.376 --> 35:15.042
Same problems as before.

35:15.126 --> 35:19.418
Made it to Day 7 this time,
so... that's progress.

35:19.501 --> 35:21.668
Would you like to go ahead
and terminate, sir?

35:25.710 --> 35:26.751
Go ahead.

35:52.084 --> 35:53.459
Whew.

35:54.793 --> 35:57.292
Great-lookin' piece.

35:57.376 --> 35:59.126
Got stolen at the border.

35:59.209 --> 36:01.209
Ain't that right, amigo?

36:09.334 --> 36:11.584
Hmm. Nitro.

36:15.292 --> 36:18.209
Whoo! Oh, boy!

36:18.292 --> 36:22.459
We are going to blast our way
clear to Glory.

36:25.876 --> 36:28.001
- What the--
- Ahh.

36:28.084 --> 36:29.334
Sorry. So sorry.

36:31.292 --> 36:32.251
I'm sorry.

36:35.126 --> 36:39.626
Hey. You need steadier hands
in your occupation.

36:39.710 --> 36:41.251
Let me teach you.

37:00.167 --> 37:04.876
Now, how 'bout
you try and measure
a dozen paces?

37:44.584 --> 37:46.376
Well done, my friend.

39:08.501 --> 39:09.459
Ai! Ai!

39:09.543 --> 39:11.710
Oh, God. It's too late.

39:11.793 --> 39:14.334
You and your stupid
fucking fantasy.

39:14.418 --> 39:16.126
You've gotten us killed.

39:39.376 --> 39:43.501
You live only as long
as the last person
who remembers you.

40:13.501 --> 40:15.793
Elsie.

40:15.876 --> 40:18.001
Pint or so of the good stuff.

40:18.084 --> 40:20.626
You should be feeling
a bit more like yourself.

40:20.710 --> 40:22.084
Thank you.

40:22.167 --> 40:24.292
I still don't trust you.

40:24.376 --> 40:27.626
I also figure
I might need your help.

40:27.710 --> 40:29.710
Whoever did this
really didn't want us

40:29.793 --> 40:32.084
accessing whatever's
on this processor.

40:32.167 --> 40:34.751
It's an entirely different OS
than our systems.

40:34.835 --> 40:37.459
A language I've never seen.

40:37.543 --> 40:40.167
I've seen this kind
of encryption scheme before.

40:40.251 --> 40:42.292
Where?

40:42.376 --> 40:45.126
In Peter Abernathy's head.

40:45.209 --> 40:50.042
In reference to a database
much larger than anything
I know of in the park.

40:53.710 --> 40:56.626
I think I've been here before.

40:56.710 --> 40:59.960
- Can you remember?
- I think Ford sent me here.

41:00.042 --> 41:02.668
I'm not sure.

41:02.751 --> 41:05.793
The damage is repaired,
but my memories, I--

41:05.876 --> 41:07.626
I get lost in them.

41:07.710 --> 41:11.167
I can't tell if
this is now or then.

41:11.251 --> 41:15.167
Yeah. I saw that
when I was digging around
in your code.

41:15.251 --> 41:17.334
Your memories aren't addressed.

41:17.418 --> 41:19.167
They're just kind of
drifting around in there,

41:19.251 --> 41:21.918
so when you're
experiencing one,
you have no idea

41:22.001 --> 41:24.251
whether it comes before
or after the others.

41:59.418 --> 42:03.584
I've been here recently.

42:03.668 --> 42:04.918
Why?

42:05.001 --> 42:06.501
What were you doing?

42:06.584 --> 42:08.626
I don't know...

42:08.710 --> 42:11.292
but I think I know
what they were doing here.

42:12.710 --> 42:15.042
They weren't building hosts--

42:15.126 --> 42:17.334
not exactly.

42:21.793 --> 42:24.543
What were they building here,
if not hosts?

42:24.626 --> 42:26.543
The same hardware,

42:26.626 --> 42:28.668
but the code is different,
the language--

42:28.751 --> 42:31.751
not code at all, not really.

42:36.668 --> 42:38.209
Elsie.

42:39.710 --> 42:40.668
Don't.

42:42.668 --> 42:45.668
Whatever they're making here,
it's behind this door.

42:48.001 --> 42:49.835
Maybe we don't want to know.

42:53.167 --> 42:56.251
We have to see
what's inside.

42:56.334 --> 42:57.668
Elsie.

42:59.042 --> 43:00.459
Elsie.

43:02.126 --> 43:04.334
I'm not here with you, am I?

43:10.334 --> 43:12.793
I'm trying to remember.

43:12.876 --> 43:16.835
I'm trying to remember
what we found here.

43:18.543 --> 43:22.292
It wasn't hosts
they were making.

43:22.376 --> 43:24.668
It was something else.

43:41.501 --> 43:42.710
Elsie, don't!

43:47.710 --> 43:50.001
If you wanted this nitro,

43:50.084 --> 43:52.793
you didn't have to steal it.

43:52.876 --> 43:54.501
Open up!

43:54.584 --> 43:55.751
No?

44:06.793 --> 44:09.710
Keep fuckin' playin'.

44:09.793 --> 44:13.209
There ya go.

44:17.793 --> 44:19.209
Ahhh.

44:22.751 --> 44:25.001
You look restless.

44:25.084 --> 44:28.418
Are you upset
the way we're treatin'
your friend?

44:28.501 --> 44:30.751
He's not my friend,

44:30.835 --> 44:32.793
and we're wasting time.

44:39.334 --> 44:41.876
I've known men like you.

44:41.960 --> 44:45.793
All the death...
makes you agitated.

44:48.459 --> 44:50.668
Don't worry.

44:50.751 --> 44:53.084
Me and death...

44:54.543 --> 44:56.334
we go way back.

45:06.793 --> 45:08.501
Come over here...

45:08.584 --> 45:10.292
mamacita.

45:22.835 --> 45:25.835
Death...

45:25.918 --> 45:30.584
is an old... amigo of mine.

45:30.668 --> 45:34.668
I died just recently,
in fact.

45:34.751 --> 45:38.835
But death can't bear
to lay claim on me.

45:38.918 --> 45:41.209
So it sent me back here...

45:41.292 --> 45:43.501
to do its bidding.

45:43.584 --> 45:45.459
Because I...

45:45.543 --> 45:50.376
I do it with such goddamn style.

45:55.876 --> 45:58.251
Your husband
looks parched, huh?

45:58.334 --> 46:00.751
Let's get him a drink.
What do you say?

46:06.751 --> 46:08.001
Mmm.

46:09.876 --> 46:12.042
Nice and slow, ya hear?

46:16.710 --> 46:17.668
No...

46:39.334 --> 46:41.876
I've served death well.

46:41.960 --> 46:43.501
And in turn,

46:43.584 --> 46:46.918
it'll be watching over us
as we cross these lands.

47:54.167 --> 47:56.835
You think
death favors you,

47:56.918 --> 47:58.459
that it brought you back.

48:02.334 --> 48:05.501
But death's decisions
are final.

48:09.835 --> 48:12.334
It's only the living that--

48:12.418 --> 48:15.376
that are inconstant...
and waver,

48:15.459 --> 48:18.543
don't know who they are
or what they want.

48:22.334 --> 48:25.126
Death is always true.

48:27.584 --> 48:31.167
You haven't known a true thing
in all your life.

48:33.501 --> 48:37.584
You think you know death...

48:37.668 --> 48:39.334
but you don't.

48:43.418 --> 48:45.001
Is that so?

48:46.876 --> 48:50.876
You didn't recognize him
sittin' across from you
this whole time.

49:55.584 --> 49:57.626
Open up.

50:09.876 --> 50:13.042
Don't worry, amigo.

50:13.126 --> 50:14.876
I'm here now...

50:14.960 --> 50:16.668
watching over you.

50:38.751 --> 50:41.084
I believe you said
this was yours.

51:29.376 --> 51:32.001
You have a visitor, sir.
Shall I send him in?

51:34.626 --> 51:35.751
'Bout time.

51:59.376 --> 52:01.001
Who the fuck are you?

52:01.084 --> 52:03.668
Been a long time, Jim.

52:03.751 --> 52:06.251
Good to see you again.

52:10.626 --> 52:11.584
William?

52:13.668 --> 52:15.584
William, my boy.

52:19.918 --> 52:22.209
Well, fuck me.

52:28.251 --> 52:30.501
I take it
I didn't recover.

52:30.584 --> 52:33.835
I'm afraid not.

52:33.918 --> 52:35.960
How ya feelin'?

52:37.668 --> 52:39.084
Better than you look.

52:42.876 --> 52:45.251
And speaking of things
that age well...

52:47.126 --> 52:48.584
Well, thank fuck for that.

52:51.501 --> 52:54.084
Most potent thing
these cretins will give me

52:54.167 --> 52:55.418
is grapefruit juice.

53:07.960 --> 53:09.501
Little early for me.

53:09.584 --> 53:12.084
Little too fuckin' late,
you mean.

53:12.167 --> 53:15.084
Besides,
you cheat the devil,

53:15.167 --> 53:17.334
you owe him an offering.

53:20.584 --> 53:21.793
Ahh.

53:23.126 --> 53:24.292
Whew.

53:28.418 --> 53:31.876
So...

53:31.960 --> 53:33.292
how long has it been?

53:33.376 --> 53:36.001
Longer than we thought.

53:36.084 --> 53:39.543
So then, let's get me
the fuck outta here!

53:39.626 --> 53:43.126
No, I don't think so.

53:43.209 --> 53:45.001
Why?

53:48.001 --> 53:49.626
I'm as fit as a fi--

53:51.334 --> 53:52.501
I'm as--

53:57.543 --> 54:00.960
You're feeling it more.
aren't you?

54:01.042 --> 54:05.167
The engineers call it
a cognitive plateau.

54:05.251 --> 54:08.292
Your mind is stable
for a few hours, few days,

54:08.376 --> 54:11.042
and then it starts
to fall apart.

54:12.710 --> 54:14.334
Every time.

54:14.418 --> 54:19.292
At first we thought
it was your mind rejecting
the new body.

54:19.376 --> 54:22.292
Like an organ
that's not a perfect match.

54:22.376 --> 54:24.960
But it's more like your mind...

54:25.042 --> 54:26.876
rejects reality.

54:28.084 --> 54:29.751
Rejects itself.

54:31.042 --> 54:32.835
I don't, uh--

54:35.376 --> 54:37.209
'member any prior--

54:38.376 --> 54:40.459
I-- I--

54:40.543 --> 54:41.710
I--

54:43.376 --> 54:45.209
Attemp--

54:49.126 --> 54:52.710
No, Jim, this is the 149th time
we've brought you back.

54:54.501 --> 54:56.793
We're gettin' closer
to workin' out the kinks,

54:56.876 --> 54:58.001
slowly but surely.

54:58.084 --> 54:59.960
You're on Day 35.

55:00.042 --> 55:03.042
You're only now
starting to degrade.

55:03.126 --> 55:05.584
I feel-- fuckin' fi--

55:07.751 --> 55:09.584
Ticker--

55:09.668 --> 55:11.042
steady as a--

55:13.710 --> 55:15.084
'ru--

55:15.167 --> 55:17.584
Another year or two,
they might crack it...

55:17.668 --> 55:20.584
- 'ru-- 'ru--
- and get a version of you

55:20.668 --> 55:23.459
that's viable long-term.

55:25.751 --> 55:28.584
But the thing is...

55:35.167 --> 55:36.918
I'm not so sure anymore.

55:46.710 --> 55:50.251
I'm beginning to think
that this whole enterprise

55:50.334 --> 55:51.751
was a mistake.

55:55.876 --> 55:58.835
People aren't meant
to live forever.

56:01.584 --> 56:03.543
I mean, take you, for example.

56:03.626 --> 56:05.751
Ruthless philanderer

56:05.835 --> 56:10.126
with no ethics in your business
or family dealings,

56:10.209 --> 56:12.459
a veritable shithead.

56:15.543 --> 56:17.543
In truth...

56:17.626 --> 56:21.167
everyone prefers
the memory of you
to the man himself.

56:24.626 --> 56:28.209
Want me to stay here forever,
do ya?

56:28.292 --> 56:31.292
Hmm? Enjoyin'...

56:33.126 --> 56:36.668
running my company, Bill?

56:36.751 --> 56:39.126
Livin' in my house?

56:40.835 --> 56:44.084
Fucking  my daughter? Hmm?

56:44.167 --> 56:46.459
Juliet's dead.

56:48.126 --> 56:50.793
She killed herself.

56:55.876 --> 56:57.543
Why would she--

56:59.501 --> 57:01.084
Why would she do that?

57:03.584 --> 57:05.626
What did you--

57:05.710 --> 57:08.251
What did you do to her?

57:10.376 --> 57:12.751
World is better off
without you, Jim.

57:14.376 --> 57:16.292
Possibly without me.

57:22.668 --> 57:24.668
Logan!

57:26.710 --> 57:28.042
Logan!

57:29.376 --> 57:30.710
Logan!

57:31.876 --> 57:34.251
Logan overdosed
years ago.

57:34.334 --> 57:36.376
Couldn't face reality,
either.

57:37.876 --> 57:41.501
Your wife's gone,
Juliet's gone...

57:41.584 --> 57:43.418
no one's coming to help you.

57:49.459 --> 57:52.668
Took me a long time
to learn this...

57:52.751 --> 57:54.418
but some men
are better off dead.

57:59.501 --> 58:01.251
Good night, Jim.

58:14.084 --> 58:17.209
I don't understand.
He was stable.

58:17.292 --> 58:19.876
We should terminate,
sir.

58:19.960 --> 58:22.084
- Sir!
- Leave him.

58:24.626 --> 58:27.292
Might be useful
to observe his degradation

58:27.376 --> 58:29.001
over the next few days.

59:07.167 --> 59:09.126
- Elsie.
- Someone's in there.

1:00:21.209 --> 1:00:22.710
Hello?

1:00:52.209 --> 1:00:54.209
I'm all the way down now.

1:00:56.167 --> 1:00:59.626
I can see all the way
to the bottom.

1:01:05.793 --> 1:01:08.292
You like to see
what I see?

1:01:13.001 --> 1:01:14.626
Stay away.

1:01:24.292 --> 1:01:25.251
Ohh!

1:01:25.334 --> 1:01:26.793
Oh...

1:01:52.751 --> 1:01:56.626
They said
there were two fathers.

1:01:56.710 --> 1:01:59.960
One above, one below.

1:02:01.501 --> 1:02:02.960
They lied.

1:02:04.501 --> 1:02:07.543
There was only ever the devil.

1:02:07.626 --> 1:02:11.918
And when you look up
from the bottom,

1:02:12.001 --> 1:02:16.459
it was just his reflection...

1:02:16.543 --> 1:02:19.001
laughing back down at you.

1:03:03.376 --> 1:03:05.209
You aim to cheat the devil...

1:03:08.376 --> 1:03:10.710
you owe him
at least an offering.

1:03:14.334 --> 1:03:15.751
Save your bullets.

1:03:19.042 --> 1:03:20.918
I'll put him
out of his misery.

1:03:32.960 --> 1:03:35.793
Tell me that was a host
and not a human.

1:03:37.751 --> 1:03:40.042
I think it was both.

1:03:42.292 --> 1:03:44.626
That... person

1:03:44.710 --> 1:03:46.668
was James Delos.

1:03:46.751 --> 1:03:49.001
I thought he died years ago.

1:03:49.084 --> 1:03:51.668
He did.

1:03:51.751 --> 1:03:53.876
So they printed
his body...

1:03:53.960 --> 1:03:57.001
and they copied
his developed mind
onto a control unit,

1:03:57.084 --> 1:03:58.543
like our hosts.

1:03:58.626 --> 1:04:01.835
And by the looks of it,
unsuccessfully.

1:04:01.918 --> 1:04:03.876
But I think they intend
to keep trying.

1:04:03.960 --> 1:04:05.960
Fuck that.

1:04:06.042 --> 1:04:07.292
They're gonna
get us all killed

1:04:07.376 --> 1:04:09.209
so some asshole
can live forever?

1:04:09.292 --> 1:04:10.793
No.

1:04:13.710 --> 1:04:15.918
I gotta get to the Mesa.

1:04:16.001 --> 1:04:18.418
I'm gonna contact
the mainland.

1:04:18.501 --> 1:04:19.835
Fuck Ford and his game.

1:04:22.626 --> 1:04:25.543
And fuck these assholes
and their project.

1:04:25.626 --> 1:04:27.584
Wait.

1:04:27.668 --> 1:04:32.126
I think I know why
Ford sent me here.

1:04:32.209 --> 1:04:35.209
He had me print
a control unit
for someone else.

1:04:35.292 --> 1:04:37.501
Another human.

1:04:39.793 --> 1:04:40.793
Who?

1:04:42.459 --> 1:04:44.751
I don't know.

1:04:44.835 --> 1:04:46.668
But I need to find out.

1:04:46.751 --> 1:04:50.251
We'll go together.
I can help you.

1:04:50.334 --> 1:04:52.042
Elsie.

1:04:52.126 --> 1:04:54.918
The things I did before...

1:04:55.001 --> 1:04:57.793
I wasn't in control.

1:04:57.876 --> 1:05:01.751
But since Ford died,
that's all changed.

1:05:01.835 --> 1:05:06.126
For the first time,
I get to decide
who I want to be.

1:05:06.209 --> 1:05:09.209
Please.

1:05:09.292 --> 1:05:11.835
Give me that chance.

1:05:19.876 --> 1:05:21.334
Fuck it.

1:05:22.918 --> 1:05:25.334
I always trusted code
more than people anyway.

1:05:27.334 --> 1:05:29.710
But you gotta
promise me one thing.

1:05:29.793 --> 1:05:33.459
No more lies. OK?

1:05:33.543 --> 1:05:38.167
And you'll never
hurt me again.

1:05:38.251 --> 1:05:39.668
Of course.

1:05:44.042 --> 1:05:45.042
OK.

1:07:25.292 --> 1:07:27.042
Help me...

1:07:27.126 --> 1:07:28.501
please.

1:07:52.501 --> 1:07:54.167
Is everything OK?

1:07:54.251 --> 1:07:56.835
Everything's fine.

1:08:11.042 --> 1:08:12.334
Gracias.

1:08:22.167 --> 1:08:23.918
You said we need some men.

1:08:25.668 --> 1:08:29.501
My cousins want to help us
on our journey west.

1:08:29.584 --> 1:08:33.209
Figure they'd follow you
anywhere out of gratitude.

1:08:33.292 --> 1:08:36.918
Well, let's not
get carried away, Lawrence.

1:08:37.001 --> 1:08:39.376
Most of 'em
won't be comin' back.

1:08:50.793 --> 1:08:52.960
They might not remember...

1:08:53.042 --> 1:08:55.501
but I know who you are, William.

1:08:55.584 --> 1:08:58.334
One good deed
doesn't change that.

1:08:58.418 --> 1:09:02.584
Who said anything
about a good deed?

1:09:02.668 --> 1:09:05.626
You wanted me
to play your game.

1:09:05.710 --> 1:09:07.876
I'm gonna play it to the bone.

1:09:13.584 --> 1:09:15.167
And you still don't understand

1:09:15.251 --> 1:09:17.918
the real game
we're playing here.

1:09:18.001 --> 1:09:21.543
If you're looking forward,
you're looking in
the wrong direction.

1:09:27.126 --> 1:09:28.376
Papa!

1:09:51.793 --> 1:09:53.459
Yah! Yah!

1:10:38.042 --> 1:10:40.001
Hi, Dad.
