00:04.205 --> 00:06.672
Hello, Australia.

00:06.674 --> 00:10.376
ALF calling Australia.
Come in please.

00:10.378 --> 00:11.710
Good day.

00:13.514 --> 00:15.748
What's the matter,
a dingo got your tongue?

00:17.151 --> 00:21.653
ALF to Australia.
ALF to Australia. Come in.

00:21.655 --> 00:23.922
- Say, what are you doing?
- Willie.

00:23.924 --> 00:28.394
I've got the most brilliant
money-making plan ever devised.

00:30.898 --> 00:32.598
I'm glad you asked.

00:32.600 --> 00:35.601
Did you know that it's already
tomorrow in Australia?

00:35.603 --> 00:39.438
Well.. that's because
to get there you have to cross

00:39.440 --> 00:41.407
the international date line.

00:41.409 --> 00:44.143
Well, that's fascinating,
for those of us who care.

00:45.646 --> 00:47.980
Why the racing form?

00:47.982 --> 00:49.615
It's all part of the plan.

00:49.617 --> 00:52.251
See, I'm trying to get an
Australian to check

00:52.253 --> 00:55.254
tomorrow's "LA Times"
and tell me who's gonna win

00:55.256 --> 00:58.357
the Pick Six tonight
at Hollywood Park.

00:58.359 --> 00:59.725
[laughs]

00:59.727 --> 01:02.494
Oh, I can't believe
no one's thought of this before.

01:03.731 --> 01:08.067
Um.... Heh.
Let me try to explain here.

01:08.069 --> 01:10.402
Uh, it's not really
tomorrow there.

01:10.404 --> 01:14.640
Well, it is for them
but for us it's today.

01:14.642 --> 01:19.711
You see, the time is the same,
it's just it's different days.

01:19.713 --> 01:21.613
Go ahead, make the bet.

[beeping over radio]

01:25.920 --> 01:27.352

01:27.354 --> 01:29.755
I don't know, Willie.
Listen, listen.

01:31.325 --> 01:33.525
[beeping over radio]

01:33.527 --> 01:37.463
- This can't be possible.
- What? What's not possible?

01:37.465 --> 01:41.200
This message,
it's in Melmacian code.

01:42.770 --> 01:44.803
Someone's trying to contact me.

01:47.608 --> 01:50.609
[theme music]

02:54.575 --> 02:56.975
Did you get it?
Have you translated the code?

02:56.977 --> 02:58.577
You're not gonna believe this.

02:58.579 --> 03:01.780
- What does it say?
- They're coming to get me.

03:01.782 --> 03:05.384
- Who? Who's coming to get you?
- My friends Skip and Rhonda.

03:05.386 --> 03:08.153
They've been trying
to contact me for days.

03:08.155 --> 03:11.156
Seems they bought a new planet
and they want me to join them

03:11.158 --> 03:13.725
in the beginning
of a new Melmac.

03:13.727 --> 03:16.128
Now, are you sure
you copied it down right?

03:16.130 --> 03:17.663
I mean, I wouldn't
wanna get my..

03:17.665 --> 03:19.865
Your hopes up.

03:19.867 --> 03:22.467
I certainly don't need
to decode that.

03:24.271 --> 03:28.273
I don't understand.
How can you just buy a planet?

03:28.275 --> 03:32.211
Well, they got a good deal
on a foreclosure.

03:32.213 --> 03:34.846
You know what this means?

03:34.848 --> 03:37.849
It means a chance
for a new homeland

03:37.851 --> 03:40.819
where liberty and freedom and
the rights of the individual

03:40.821 --> 03:42.754
will reign supreme.

03:42.756 --> 03:44.323
As soon as we
buy off the natives

03:44.325 --> 03:46.425
with some cheap trinkets.

03:47.861 --> 03:51.697
Well, I guess we should have
expected this day might come.

03:52.833 --> 03:55.100
When are Skip and Rhonda
coming for you?

03:55.102 --> 03:56.401
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

03:56.403 --> 03:58.837
What's with the bum's rush here?

03:58.839 --> 04:01.607
Well, we assume by our..

04:01.609 --> 04:04.042
Your excitement
that you're going.

04:04.044 --> 04:07.179
Well, maybe, maybe not.

04:07.181 --> 04:08.914
There's a lot to consider.

04:08.916 --> 04:10.916
Not the least of
which is the $600

04:10.918 --> 04:13.552
they want for
a security deposit.

04:13.554 --> 04:15.520
That's not a problem.

04:16.590 --> 04:18.624
Somebody get her a hanky.

04:21.729 --> 04:25.364
- ALF, don't go.
- Oh, finally.

04:27.268 --> 04:28.667
You know, it's not
that we're anxious

04:28.669 --> 04:30.936
to see you leave, exactly.

04:30.938 --> 04:32.404
It's just that

04:32.406 --> 04:35.474
well, this should be
the fulfillment of a dream.

04:35.476 --> 04:38.944
We don't wanna
stand in your way.

04:38.946 --> 04:40.445
Nice save.

04:41.982 --> 04:43.248
Man.

04:43.250 --> 04:45.984
How can I make a decision
like this?

04:45.986 --> 04:49.488
Whatever I decide
I lose something.

04:50.824 --> 04:53.325
When do you have
to let them know?

04:53.327 --> 04:54.926
Well, they said
they're gonna broadcast

04:54.928 --> 04:56.595

05:10.644 --> 05:12.678
What do you suppose
it means, colonel?

05:12.680 --> 05:14.079
Do you really think there's
something out there

05:14.081 --> 05:15.113
trying to reach us?

05:15.115 --> 05:16.148
I hope so.

- Did you get through to NASA?

05:24.792 --> 05:26.124
Afraid he's as stumped
as we are, sir.

05:26.126 --> 05:27.259
Ugh.

05:27.261 --> 05:30.495
What is it? What does it mean?

05:30.497 --> 05:33.332
What we have is a continuously
repeating signal.

05:33.334 --> 05:37.436
It's not coming from a satellite
or any other man-made device.

05:37.438 --> 05:39.604
It's originating
from deep space,

05:39.606 --> 05:41.673
and it appears
to be coming closer.

05:41.675 --> 05:46.545
We have every available computer
working on this night and day.

05:46.547 --> 05:49.848
We will find out what this
means, alright, sergeant?

05:49.850 --> 05:51.516
Yes, sir.

05:52.419 --> 05:54.052
I love it when he takes control.

05:54.054 --> 05:56.688
- What's that, sergeant?
- Uh, nothing, sir.

really fast.

Oh, oh. And here's
that fake finger

to spit anything that far.

accomplishments ahead of you.

you'll fall in love.

She'll break your heart,
you'll find somebody better.

07:07.327 --> 07:10.896
You'll have children,
they'll break your heart.

07:12.032 --> 07:14.900
Eventually, you'll
grow old and die.

on all that, do you?

aren't they?

Well, they're not gonna
land here, are they?

Because I've seen
the way you guys park.

They've given me coordinates

07:55.042 --> 07:57.843

on the edge of town.

so it's now or never.

was where on Earth

you'll wear it and think of me.

Oh. Your locket.

Really?

13:39.619 --> 13:43.354
Well, as you know,
we haven't always gotten along.

13:43.356 --> 13:45.824
Or been that close.

13:45.826 --> 13:48.259
But we have seen
each other naked.

But family members often
disagree with each other.

they love each other any less.

14:00.207 --> 14:02.040
I guess having you with us

14:02.042 --> 14:05.643
has enriched our family.

14:05.645 --> 14:10.915
It's given each of us a new
perspective on life and living

14:10.917 --> 14:15.086
and taught us incredible
survival skills.

14:16.790 --> 14:20.024
You know, whatever doesn't
kill you, makes you stronger.

14:24.831 --> 14:29.234
Well, ALF,
I don't know what to say.

14:29.236 --> 14:33.238
You've certainly
turned our lives inside out

14:34.107 --> 14:36.641
but you've also made us laugh.

14:37.777 --> 14:40.144
You've expanded our horizons.

14:40.146 --> 14:41.512
You've given us experiences

14:41.514 --> 14:44.215
that no other family
on Earth can share.

14:44.217 --> 14:49.220
And, although it's gonna
leave a big void

14:49.222 --> 14:52.323
right in the middle
of our lives

14:52.325 --> 14:55.193
it means that you're
going to have a chance

14:55.195 --> 14:59.797
to live a life
with dignity and purpose.

14:59.799 --> 15:01.866
The life that awaits you
in your new home.

15:01.868 --> 15:03.167
And I think it's that thought

15:03.169 --> 15:07.305
that makes the idea
of missing you bearable.

15:08.141 --> 15:11.075
Oh, Willie, take me with you.

15:12.913 --> 15:15.113
You're the one that's going.

15:16.483 --> 15:17.982
Oh, yeah.

15:17.984 --> 15:20.151
I was caught up in the moment.

15:21.154 --> 15:22.854
Well, we thought it was only

15:22.856 --> 15:27.158
proper this time,
to give you this.

15:29.396 --> 15:31.462
A stick.

15:31.464 --> 15:35.266
Look, everybody.
Willie gave me a stick.

15:36.803 --> 15:39.003
Not just any stick.

15:39.005 --> 15:42.874
This is a stick
from the roof of our garage.

15:42.876 --> 15:47.078
The garage that
you crashed into

15:47.080 --> 15:49.414
almost four years ago now.

15:50.817 --> 15:52.383
Read what it says.

15:54.521 --> 15:58.589
"To ALF.
If you ever drop in again,

15:58.591 --> 16:02.527
please use the front door.
Love, the Tanners."

16:04.030 --> 16:05.563
Thanks, guys.

16:08.735 --> 16:11.903
Now I'd like to say something,
if I might.

16:11.905 --> 16:14.238
Go ahead, ALF.

16:14.240 --> 16:17.375
I wanna thank you
for taking me in

16:17.377 --> 16:20.044
and making me
feel like family.

16:21.247 --> 16:22.947
Oh, ALF.

16:22.949 --> 16:25.783
And if I have one regret

16:25.785 --> 16:30.521
it's that I couldn't
walk among humans unafraid.

16:30.523 --> 16:33.491
Walk up to some
Joe Citizen and say

16:33.493 --> 16:37.562
"Hey, Joe, wanna grab a brewski
and talk about the Lakers?"

16:38.999 --> 16:43.935
But I can do that
where I'm going

16:43.937 --> 16:47.305
although none of us
are named Joe.

16:52.278 --> 16:54.645
Well, Eric's in his car seat.

16:54.647 --> 16:56.280
It's time to go.

17:07.427 --> 17:09.627
I can't let you leave
without doing this.

17:10.497 --> 17:11.662
Uh-oh.

17:15.869 --> 17:17.268
(ALF)
Oh.

17:20.540 --> 17:21.773
Be happy.

17:23.443 --> 17:25.743
Come on. You're gonna be late.

17:25.745 --> 17:27.478
I'll be right out.

17:35.088 --> 17:38.289
[instrumental music]

17:39.292 --> 17:40.691
[car door closes]

17:41.594 --> 17:42.794
[car cranks over]

17:44.197 --> 17:47.265
Well, goodbye, house.

17:55.875 --> 17:57.341
[car horn honks]

18:00.246 --> 18:03.347
Four years
and they give me a stick.

18:05.452 --> 18:06.784
[scoffs]

18:13.793 --> 18:15.827
Good news, sir.

18:15.829 --> 18:17.562
We cracked the code.

18:17.564 --> 18:18.930
What is it?

18:18.932 --> 18:21.265
It appears
that an alien spacecraft

18:21.267 --> 18:24.368
is about to rendezvous
with one of its own.

18:25.738 --> 18:30.675
I knew it! I knew it!
We're not crazy!

18:30.677 --> 18:34.779
We haven't wasted the last
10 years of our lives.

18:34.781 --> 18:37.615
The, uh, coordinates would
indicate that the contact point

18:37.617 --> 18:41.552
is a field just outside of
Los Angeles at, uh, 2400 hours.

18:41.554 --> 18:43.321
Damn! I wanted to be
there for it.

18:43.323 --> 18:45.756
Alright. Alert LA.
Tell them to get moving.

18:45.758 --> 18:47.525
Oh, and tell them
to keep a low profile.

18:47.527 --> 18:49.160
We don't wanna scare 'em away.

18:49.162 --> 18:52.663
Gentlemen, get ready
to go down in history.

18:52.665 --> 18:53.831
[chuckles]

18:54.968 --> 18:58.169
[cricket chirping]

19:04.110 --> 19:05.409
[sighs]

19:13.520 --> 19:14.685
Willie.

19:14.687 --> 19:17.855
ALF, we just stopped
five minutes ago.

19:17.857 --> 19:19.657
I wanna be sure.

19:19.659 --> 19:22.527
Have you ever used a bathroom
at zero gravity?

19:24.063 --> 19:25.930
You think I'm messy at home.

19:28.434 --> 19:29.834
[breaks squealing]

19:31.471 --> 19:33.671
[instrumental music]

19:36.309 --> 19:38.876
(officer over radio)
'We're about five minutes
from rendezvous point.'

19:38.878 --> 19:40.511
'No visual contact.'

19:41.915 --> 19:43.514
'Please advise.'

19:43.516 --> 19:45.449
The UFO has been picked up
on radar.

19:45.451 --> 19:46.717
It's right on course.

19:46.719 --> 19:49.654
Proceed with caution.
Code yellow.

19:50.690 --> 19:51.889
[beeping]

19:54.427 --> 19:57.628
[music continues]

20:07.941 --> 20:11.742
Well I guess this must be it.

20:11.744 --> 20:15.913
Nothing to do now
but unload the car and wait.

20:17.550 --> 20:20.818
We have established visual
contact with ground zero.

20:20.820 --> 20:23.754
There's an unknown
civilian vehicle on site.

20:23.756 --> 20:26.724
- Please advise.
- Good. Stay calm.

20:27.894 --> 20:30.094
Go to code green.

20:30.096 --> 20:31.395
Good luck, men.

20:33.132 --> 20:37.435
(Kate)
It's a fine night
to leave the galaxy.

20:37.437 --> 20:39.904
Does anyone know
what poison oak looks like?

20:41.474 --> 20:43.674
Why is this so heavy?

20:45.578 --> 20:49.480
- Isn't this our VCR?
- Oh, is it? Ha.

20:49.482 --> 20:51.382
You know, I couldn't
remember whether

20:51.384 --> 20:54.252
I bought that
or if you guys, uh..

20:56.856 --> 20:58.856
Keep it. I insist.

21:01.561 --> 21:05.563
As I recall, you only had two
suitcases when you got here.

21:05.565 --> 21:08.266
What's in these boxes, anyway?

21:08.268 --> 21:09.667
[whirring]

21:12.105 --> 21:14.005
ALF, your ride's here.

21:16.409 --> 21:18.609
[wind whooshing]

21:38.264 --> 21:39.997
Safe home, my friend.

21:39.999 --> 21:41.499
Hey, no problem.

21:41.501 --> 21:43.834
We'll be going against traffic.

21:53.746 --> 21:56.747
[dramatic music]

22:06.059 --> 22:08.159
ALF! Someone's coming!

22:08.161 --> 22:09.493
Get back here!

22:11.064 --> 22:12.797
What?

22:12.799 --> 22:14.198
[whimpering]

22:14.200 --> 22:15.599
Uh-oh.

22:15.601 --> 22:18.035
[spaceship whirs]

22:18.037 --> 22:20.137
Wait! Wait!

22:20.139 --> 22:21.639
Don't leave me!

22:29.882 --> 22:31.315
ALF!

22:31.317 --> 22:33.584
Dad, do something!

22:34.420 --> 22:36.420
Stay right where you are.

22:39.892 --> 22:42.126
Uh, hey, guys.

22:43.229 --> 22:45.629
You wanna grab a brewski?

22:46.599 --> 22:48.933
What about those Lakers, huh?

22:55.508 --> 22:57.141
Just my luck.

22:57.143 --> 22:59.610
Not a sports fan among you.

23:13.526 --> 23:16.026
[theme music]

23:40.553 --> 23:43.087
[ALF laughs]
