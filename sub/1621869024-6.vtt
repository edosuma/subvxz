WEBVTT

00:08.550 --> 00:11.887
As long as it's a three-bedroom flat,
we can take Princess and Tyler.

00:11.970 --> 00:15.224
Penny said she'll know more in a week.
We have to make it amazing by then.

00:15.307 --> 00:16.975
I need something to occupy my brain,

00:17.059 --> 00:19.478
'cause it starts to do that fizzy thing
when I worry.

00:21.021 --> 00:24.441
But, yeah, I mean,
how much space does a kid need?

00:24.900 --> 00:28.570
He sleeps here. He dresses here.

00:28.654 --> 00:32.406
And this area here is for relaxing.

00:32.491 --> 00:33.825
-You know what else we could do?
-What?

00:33.909 --> 00:35.536
-Right. Put water...
-Yeah?

00:35.619 --> 00:38.163
...in the paint.
Make it thinner. Apply a single coat.

00:38.247 --> 00:40.624
That's gonna give us
an extra millimeter of space.

00:40.707 --> 00:42.417
Exactly. See?
It's all gonna be fine, isn't it?

00:42.501 --> 00:45.254
-It's a three-bedroom flat.
-Oh, yeah.

00:49.258 --> 00:50.509
That was me, not the room.

01:24.710 --> 01:26.253
Stop it, Jessie. Stop it.

01:26.336 --> 01:29.548
Hayley, please.
There's people trying to sleep in here.

01:40.350 --> 01:42.060
Bought the wrong crisps by mistake.

01:43.228 --> 01:44.396
These are horrible.

01:45.522 --> 01:46.648
Bloody horrible.

01:48.233 --> 01:51.320
I got a message from the adoption crowd.

01:51.403 --> 01:54.823
About that party
at Ben and Denise's tonight.

01:55.407 --> 01:56.450
With the gang.

01:56.992 --> 01:59.036
I thought we could go to
take our minds off--

01:59.119 --> 02:01.038
What has happened?

02:01.121 --> 02:04.249
I'm on edge waiting for news,
so I thought this would distract.

02:04.333 --> 02:05.375
Jason, I'm scared.

02:05.459 --> 02:07.628
-What even are they?
-Pom-poms.

02:07.711 --> 02:10.005
I told you my mind goes fizzy.

02:10.088 --> 02:12.257
They were a happy thing at first, but

02:12.341 --> 02:14.009
now they've become something else.

02:14.092 --> 02:15.761
Right. Okay.

02:15.844 --> 02:17.387
-We're going to the party.
-Okay.

02:18.305 --> 02:19.515
-Come on.
-Yeah.

02:21.683 --> 02:22.726
-Put it down.
-Right.

02:24.978 --> 02:26.522
-Let's go.
-All right.

02:27.606 --> 02:28.649
-I just...
-That's it.

02:35.113 --> 02:36.532
Bloody hell.

02:36.615 --> 02:38.450
-Wow.
-The size of this place.

02:39.368 --> 02:42.162
-I bet they ask us to take our shoes off.
-I hope not.

02:46.708 --> 02:48.001
-Hello, welcome.
-Hello.

02:48.085 --> 02:49.127
-Thanks, mate.
-Come in.

02:49.211 --> 02:50.212
-Thank you.
-Wow.

02:50.295 --> 02:51.880
If you could just slip your shoes off.

02:51.964 --> 02:54.216
-We're a little Japanese round here.
-Yeah.

02:54.800 --> 02:56.593
Nice socks, mate.

02:56.677 --> 02:57.970
They do the job.

02:58.053 --> 02:59.847
Head on through.
Gang's all here as they say.

02:59.930 --> 03:00.931
Who says?

03:01.014 --> 03:02.224
-Hey.
-Hiya.

03:02.307 --> 03:03.308
-Hello.
-How are ya?

03:03.392 --> 03:05.269
-Good. How are you?
-Yeah. Good, good.

03:05.352 --> 03:08.063
Oh, no.
I hate myself in paintings, don't you?

03:08.146 --> 03:09.565
-Yeah.
-Come on. Come through.

03:13.694 --> 03:17.447
Yeah, so we're at The Ivy tomorrow
night for Denise's actual birthday

03:17.531 --> 03:20.033
and then driving down to
the south of France this weekend.

03:20.117 --> 03:22.244
It's a ball ache,
but it's a stunning area.

03:22.327 --> 03:23.537
Yeah.

03:23.620 --> 03:26.790
You ever noticed how people always
say "the south of France"?

03:26.874 --> 03:28.625
Like they want you to know it's the south.

03:28.709 --> 03:32.045
Whereas everywhere else,
people just say the country, don't they?

03:32.129 --> 03:34.131
Yes. I suppose that's true, yeah.

03:36.967 --> 03:37.968
Lovely spread.

03:38.051 --> 03:39.094
Thank you.

03:39.178 --> 03:41.096
So that's two adopted kids in two years.

03:41.805 --> 03:43.640
We were sort of tempted to go for a third.

03:43.724 --> 03:46.935
No. No. Three. You've had enough.

03:47.019 --> 03:48.478
Leave some for the rest of us.

03:48.562 --> 03:50.814
Maybe a fallow year for Luke and Kwame.

03:52.357 --> 03:54.234
And what about you guys?

03:54.318 --> 03:57.404
Oh, yeah, we're getting there. We're just
waiting for final approval.

03:58.989 --> 04:00.199
That's amazing.

04:00.741 --> 04:02.826
Yeah, we've met
some really amazing kids too.

04:02.910 --> 04:04.870
We're just waiting to see if they pick us.

04:04.953 --> 04:06.997
So we're just really hopeful.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.248
That's great.

04:08.332 --> 04:09.708
Yeah.

04:38.445 --> 04:39.446
Careful!

04:39.530 --> 04:40.531
Oh, no!

04:41.532 --> 04:42.783
-Don't worry.
-What's happened?

04:42.866 --> 04:43.992
Oh, dear.

04:44.076 --> 04:46.203
-Just a mistake.
-Here. Shall I grab a broom?

04:46.286 --> 04:48.330
-Careful.
-I hope it wasn't too expensive.

04:48.413 --> 04:50.207
Well, it was quite expensive.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.543
If she wasn't adopted,
I'd be mortified by this.

04:54.461 --> 04:55.879
Although not that far from...

04:55.963 --> 04:58.131
Came from a really
strange little place in Ireland...

04:58.215 --> 04:59.716
Sorry. Yeah.

05:00.217 --> 05:02.135
What's going on?
Have you broken something again?

05:02.219 --> 05:03.262
-It's them.
-Who?

05:03.345 --> 05:05.180
-They're the other couple.
-What you mean?

05:05.264 --> 05:07.850
It's Princess and Tyler.
Ben and Denise are the other couple.

05:07.933 --> 05:10.435
-They're our competition.
-Oh, no.

05:10.519 --> 05:13.730
Jason, we shouldn't even be here.
We're behind enemy lines.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.732
If we're-- Nikki, where you going?

05:15.816 --> 05:18.235
I wanna see the rest.
I wanna see what we're up against.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.654
We've seen the rest of the house.
It's lovely. All right?

05:20.737 --> 05:23.323
You don't know.
It might not be as nice upstairs.

05:23.407 --> 05:25.617
Nikki. Nikki, you can't go up there.

05:36.336 --> 05:39.006
Well, those curtains
don't match the wallpaper, so...

05:40.215 --> 05:41.884
that's embarrassing for them.

05:42.634 --> 05:44.636
I can't believe
you took their adoption form.

05:44.720 --> 05:47.014
No, it's okay.
I'll bring it back in the morning.

05:47.639 --> 05:49.600
Back to their perfect house. Yeah.

05:49.683 --> 05:52.561
In a way,
do you think it's all a bit too perfect?

05:52.644 --> 05:55.564
-Like they're trying to hide something?
-I don't get that impression. No.

05:56.523 --> 05:58.483
They don't even have a TV, Jase.

05:58.567 --> 06:01.236
How are you supposed to raise a child
without a TV?

06:01.320 --> 06:03.947
I mean, what are you gonna ban
if they're naughty?

06:04.031 --> 06:06.575
"No TV" people are the worst people
in the whole entire world.

06:06.658 --> 06:08.660
I know, Nikki.
They're the absolute scum of the earth,

06:08.744 --> 06:12.915
but that doesn't mean that
they're gonna choose us and not them

06:12.998 --> 06:14.791
because they haven't got a telly.

06:15.709 --> 06:16.710
Yeah, I know.

06:23.008 --> 06:25.594
It's fine.
It happens to a lot of men, I think.

06:25.677 --> 06:27.513
We'll try again in three, four minutes.

06:28.764 --> 06:31.225
I mean,
you do know it's not about you, right?

06:31.308 --> 06:33.143
I know. Why would it be about me?

06:36.939 --> 06:39.024
Have you thought about switching
to probiotic yogurt?

06:39.107 --> 06:42.653
Oh, my God. Not everything can be solved
by switching to probiotic yogurt.

06:43.237 --> 06:44.988
Look, you're gonna be 40. Who cares?

06:45.072 --> 06:47.157
No, don't say that.
I find that very triggering.

06:47.241 --> 06:49.243
Okay, you're using that word wrong again.

06:50.494 --> 06:52.454
Look, just do star jumps
until you feel better.

06:52.538 --> 06:54.248
-What?
-Come on.

06:54.331 --> 06:55.666
No. I wanna talk.

06:55.749 --> 06:58.043
No, that's what your brain is expecting.

06:58.126 --> 07:00.796
Do star jumps,
and it's like, "What the hell?" Come on.

07:02.714 --> 07:05.342
Yes. Come on. Yep.

07:14.601 --> 07:16.436
All right then, you. What's the plan?

07:17.271 --> 07:20.524
I think I'm gonna be honest

07:20.607 --> 07:21.984
-and admit that I panicked...
-Yeah.

07:22.067 --> 07:24.236
-...and that I took it.
-I think that's a good idea.

07:24.319 --> 07:25.863
Yeah.

07:25.946 --> 07:28.073
I just really hoped
it would look less nice today.

07:28.156 --> 07:31.368
No, it's just a lovely nice house
on a lovely quiet street. That's all.

07:31.451 --> 07:34.079
Yeah, but do you think
maybe it's a bit too quiet?

07:34.162 --> 07:35.706
Nikki, enough, please.

07:36.498 --> 07:38.792
Yeah, I just have a feeling
that something's not right.

07:38.876 --> 07:40.794
And if there is any chance that our--

07:40.878 --> 07:42.713
the kids end up somewhere bad, then...

07:42.796 --> 07:44.882
Do you think you just
want there to be something

07:44.965 --> 07:46.800
so they can live with us and not them?

07:47.718 --> 07:49.052
-Yeah, maybe.
-Yeah.

07:49.136 --> 07:51.221
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Ay up.

07:52.598 --> 07:55.100
Here he is. Look. There she is up there.

07:57.227 --> 07:59.771
Oh, my God.
Are they gonna have afternoon sex?

07:59.855 --> 08:02.566
-Come on.
-I hate couples that rub your nose in it.

08:02.649 --> 08:03.984
Why would we wanna see that?

08:04.067 --> 08:06.528
-I know. Come on. Before they get started.
-Okay.

08:07.154 --> 08:08.238
-Hang on a sec.
-What?

08:08.322 --> 08:09.615
-Look, that fella jumping--
-Oh, my God.

08:09.698 --> 08:10.699
What--

08:10.782 --> 08:12.492
-Hide. Hide.
-Oh, my Go-- What? Where?

08:12.576 --> 08:13.827
Hide, hide. Get down.

08:14.912 --> 08:16.872
Brilliant, Jase. Like a ninja.

08:17.956 --> 08:20.918
-This is way more suspicious.
-What was that all about?

08:22.669 --> 08:23.754
-Don't know.
-Weird.

08:24.755 --> 08:25.756
Come on. Let's go.

08:25.839 --> 08:27.883
-No, hang on a second. Let's follow him.
-What?

08:27.966 --> 08:29.885
-What?
-Something's not right. Let's follow him.

08:29.968 --> 08:31.345
-Are you being serious?
-I'm serious.

08:31.428 --> 08:33.222
-Let's go!
-This is so exciting.

08:33.304 --> 08:35.599
-All right.
-All right.

08:35.682 --> 08:36.558
Let's go.

08:36.642 --> 08:37.768
All right. Yeah.

08:37.851 --> 08:39.102
Yeah. There might be a cyclist.

08:39.186 --> 08:41.563
Okay, "Highway Code."
Let's do it. Floor it.

08:47.986 --> 08:49.154
Is this stalking?

08:49.238 --> 08:51.740
No, it's not stalking. We're just
following him to see what he does.

08:52.491 --> 08:55.077
-Maybe drop back a little bit.
-No, I don't wanna lose him.

08:55.160 --> 08:56.620
Not an issue.

09:00.874 --> 09:03.293
-What you doing?
-Disguise.

09:03.377 --> 09:06.255
-Oh, my God. Where did you go?
-All right, all right.

09:06.338 --> 09:09.091
Just pretend like we're
out for a casual drive, all right?

09:10.801 --> 09:12.594
God, well, I've missed my turn now.

09:12.678 --> 09:15.264
-What you talking about? What?
-I should have turned right.

09:15.347 --> 09:17.099
-I'm out for a casual drive.
-That's good. Yeah.

09:17.182 --> 09:18.684
-That's good pretending.
-Thank you.

09:19.977 --> 09:21.395
Jase, should we be doing this?

09:21.478 --> 09:23.689
Yes. People do crazy things
to protect their kids.

09:26.066 --> 09:28.277
Honestly, Jase, I've got goose bumps.

09:28.360 --> 09:29.987
-I think he's seen us.
-What?

09:30.070 --> 09:31.238
He's seen us. Turn in here.

09:31.321 --> 09:32.865
-Where? There's nowhere to go.
-Here!

09:32.948 --> 09:34.408
-There's nowhere to go!
-Turn!

09:40.914 --> 09:43.750
It doesn't matter if he sees us.
He doesn't know us.

09:44.293 --> 09:45.627
That's true.

09:48.630 --> 09:49.715
Hello, mate.

09:52.217 --> 09:55.804
-I am telling you something is going on.
-Really?

09:55.888 --> 09:59.057
-Nikki, she's definitely having an affair.
-Jason.

09:59.141 --> 10:01.810
Let's just review the evidence
for a second. Right? Okay.

10:01.894 --> 10:03.187
Number one,

10:03.270 --> 10:05.981
you said they were cold to each other
at the party. Correct?

10:06.064 --> 10:09.026
Yeah, but, I mean, everyone's tense
before a holiday, aren't they?

10:09.109 --> 10:10.903
Okay. Right. Number two...

10:10.986 --> 10:12.988
-Yeah?
-...fence jump man.

10:13.071 --> 10:14.239
-Okay...
-Right?

10:14.323 --> 10:15.324
Right.

10:16.783 --> 10:18.368
You're regretting using your fingers now.

10:18.452 --> 10:20.078
-Little bit. Yeah.
-Yeah.

10:21.413 --> 10:24.666
I think you're saying all this
to make me feel better.

10:25.292 --> 10:27.294
Which, Jase, that's really sweet.

10:27.377 --> 10:28.921
No, Nikki, you're right.

10:29.004 --> 10:31.548
We know these kids now.
We care about them, right?

10:31.632 --> 10:33.842
So what happens
if they get placed with a couple,

10:34.551 --> 10:36.053
one of them is having an affair,

10:36.136 --> 10:38.222
then they end up splitting up?

10:38.305 --> 10:40.474
What's gonna happen to the kids then?

10:43.602 --> 10:44.603
Yeah.

10:51.693 --> 10:54.029
Have you seen
my copy of The Secret Garden?

10:55.072 --> 10:56.532
Why do you want that?

10:56.615 --> 10:59.660
I told you.
My mum's doing a reading at the wedding.

10:59.743 --> 11:01.703
You know, I have to say,

11:01.787 --> 11:04.915
as a piece of work,
I do find it outstays its welcome.

11:05.541 --> 11:08.168
-Well, it means a lot to me.
-Yeah.

11:09.253 --> 11:11.630
Listen, about tonight.

11:13.048 --> 11:15.050
Oh, please. Scott, no, no.

11:15.133 --> 11:18.595
I cannot go to another wedding
menu tasting on my own. It looks weird.

11:18.679 --> 11:21.056
I know.
But writing class has moved to Friday.

11:21.139 --> 11:22.599
-Really?
-Yeah.

11:23.475 --> 11:24.768
Okay.

11:26.436 --> 11:28.146
Can I ask you something, Scott?

11:30.232 --> 11:32.818
Is your writing more important to you
than me?

11:32.901 --> 11:36.196
Karen, that's a crazy thing to ask.

11:39.366 --> 11:41.660
You know I don't believe in hierarchies.

11:42.995 --> 11:45.205
You're two things that I love.

11:45.289 --> 11:47.165
One informs the other,
and you both circle me.

11:47.249 --> 11:48.959
You know, like planets.

11:50.127 --> 11:52.296
See? Equidistant.

11:54.423 --> 11:56.800
-I circle you?
-You do, my love.

11:58.302 --> 12:02.514
Listen, it's just a very busy,
very exciting time for both of us.

12:02.598 --> 12:05.350
I've got my novel.
You've got your wedding.

12:05.434 --> 12:08.979
Frida. God, I miss her.

12:12.274 --> 12:13.400
Yeah.

12:20.866 --> 12:24.161
Yeah, well, I was Jennifer until I was 19.

12:24.244 --> 12:26.955
Then my boyfriend and me were gonna
get each other's names tattooed,

12:27.039 --> 12:28.874
but he had a low pain threshold.

12:28.957 --> 12:31.668
So he started trying
to get "Jen" off the ground.

12:32.252 --> 12:35.631
So, yeah. That's the story
of how I'm called what I'm called.

12:36.840 --> 12:38.675
Sorry, I forgot your question.

12:40.802 --> 12:43.722
Right. Yeah, no,
I can't reduce the excess on that.

12:43.805 --> 12:46.642
I mean, I could, but I'm not going to.

12:47.643 --> 12:49.520
Hello? Hello?

12:54.566 --> 12:55.567
Hello?

12:56.109 --> 12:57.569
-I'm following 'em.
-Who?

12:57.653 --> 13:00.239
Denise and that guy.
They're together again.

13:00.322 --> 13:02.658
I was on lunch. I've seen them
going into a shop so I followed.

13:02.741 --> 13:04.493
Jason, don't. They'll see you.

13:04.576 --> 13:05.786
It's fine. I'm in disguise.

13:06.453 --> 13:07.913
-What, you mean...
-The beanie.

13:08.664 --> 13:10.457
Okay, what-- what they doing?

13:10.958 --> 13:12.459
Just sort of walking about a bit.

13:12.543 --> 13:14.378
What, like in an affair-y type of way?

13:14.461 --> 13:17.172
-Well, I mean, it's hard to tell.
-Well, what have they bought?

13:17.798 --> 13:21.969
Some cushions and a rug, I think.
Some paint.

13:22.052 --> 13:25.764
-What color?
-Lilac, I wanna say.

13:25.848 --> 13:29.810
That's so coupley. Pick something up
so it looks like you're buying something.

13:33.647 --> 13:35.566
No, that's worse.

13:36.942 --> 13:38.527
Will you FaceTime me so I can see?

13:38.610 --> 13:39.987
All right.

13:42.906 --> 13:43.991
Jason?

13:44.074 --> 13:45.909
-Hello.
-Shit.

13:46.368 --> 13:50.247
That is mad.
I'm just buying a bit of rope.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.499
Sorry. What kind of rope do you want?

13:52.583 --> 13:54.668
The long one or the short one?

13:55.169 --> 13:58.338
Long one? Yeah. No problem.
That's the-- I've got that.

13:58.422 --> 14:00.674
Right, so I've got the saw,
the knife and the rope.

14:04.178 --> 14:07.556
I need to-- I've got to tie something up
and then

14:08.724 --> 14:10.475
-cut it a little bit, so...
-Okay.

14:11.602 --> 14:15.189
Well, we'll leave you
to your tying and cutting.

14:15.272 --> 14:17.566
-Nice to see you. Mad.
-I'll see you.

14:17.649 --> 14:19.776
You all right, mate? Yeah?

14:22.112 --> 14:24.031
Bloody hell, what a rush.

14:24.114 --> 14:26.992
It was like a Bond film.
You were like Bond.

14:27.075 --> 14:28.076
I am like Bond.

14:28.702 --> 14:31.288
-Will you pick up some of them tea lights?
-Yeah, yeah.

14:33.665 --> 14:35.626
Would customers please note...

14:44.134 --> 14:46.178
I'm telling you, it's a secret love pad.

14:46.261 --> 14:50.224
It is a secret lilac love pad. Somewhere
for them to meet up. I'm telling you.

14:50.307 --> 14:51.308
Maybe.

14:52.392 --> 14:54.353
Jase, are we the good guys here
or the bad guys?

14:54.436 --> 14:57.105
-'Cause it's really hard to keep track.
-Listen, listen.

14:57.189 --> 14:58.774
We're just asking questions.

14:58.857 --> 15:01.944
If they've done nothing wrong,
then they've got nothing to worry about.

15:02.569 --> 15:04.613
Sounds like something
the bad guys would say.

15:05.531 --> 15:08.617
No. Do you know what? I think
we should just return the form

15:08.700 --> 15:10.077
and leave them alone.

15:10.160 --> 15:11.995
-Have you not returned it yet?
-Well, no.

15:12.079 --> 15:14.331
It's been hard to find the time
because of all the spy stuff.

15:14.414 --> 15:15.624
Nikki.

15:17.251 --> 15:19.419
Okay. We're definitely the bad guys.

15:21.088 --> 15:22.548
Have we got any sorry wine?

16:01.253 --> 16:03.297
This is not expensive enough
for sorry wine.

16:03.380 --> 16:06.091
What you talking about?
That's a £7.99 bottle of wine.

16:06.175 --> 16:08.635
We should get some wisteria.

16:08.719 --> 16:10.888
Where do you want to put it?
Around the TV?

16:14.183 --> 16:15.475
-Oh, my God.
-What?

16:15.559 --> 16:16.810
Here he is.

16:19.021 --> 16:20.063
Jason.

16:25.235 --> 16:27.487
-What are we doing?
-I don't know. I just panicked.

16:31.408 --> 16:33.952
-What's he doing?
-Well, he's just at the door.

16:34.536 --> 16:36.246
-Is she coming out?
-He's very handsome.

16:36.330 --> 16:37.331
Is he?

16:42.503 --> 16:44.296
-This is stupid.
-Come on.

16:44.379 --> 16:45.631
Yeah.

16:45.714 --> 16:48.008
Hey! Hey!

16:48.091 --> 16:50.677
Oh, my-- Oh, my God!
Jason, go do something.

16:50.761 --> 16:52.179
-He's got a hammer.
-He's gonna kill him.

16:52.262 --> 16:54.139
Your hammer. This is your hammer,
you left it.

16:54.223 --> 16:55.766
-Is that mine?
-It's definitely yours.

16:55.849 --> 16:57.601
-Yeah.
-Cheers. Appreciate that.

16:57.684 --> 16:59.728
Yeah, that's fine. It's definitely yours.
You left it in the garden.

16:59.811 --> 17:01.230
-Just thought I'd bring it out to you.
-Okay.

17:01.313 --> 17:03.690
-All right? Okay. Good job.
-Thank you. See you next week.

17:03.774 --> 17:04.900
All right. Cheers, pal.

17:22.251 --> 17:23.252
Come on. Let's go.

17:25.212 --> 17:26.630
Oh. Bloody hell.

17:41.478 --> 17:42.563
This is ridiculous.

17:42.646 --> 17:44.273
My knees have locked up. Hang on.

17:49.736 --> 17:52.239
I don't get it. There's no building work.

17:53.448 --> 17:54.449
Weird.

17:54.533 --> 17:57.619
I bet it's the conservatory.
They're such conservatory people.

18:00.497 --> 18:01.832
-Now what?
-Should we have a little...

18:01.915 --> 18:04.459
-Let's go have a little look.
-Come on, Nikki. Let's go. Please.

18:11.091 --> 18:12.176
What is it?

18:12.259 --> 18:13.594
Oh, my God.

18:17.514 --> 18:18.891
My God.

18:28.025 --> 18:30.068
-Shit.
-Shit.

18:37.492 --> 18:38.535
Hey.

18:39.620 --> 18:40.662
Can I come in?

18:43.624 --> 18:44.625
Yeah.

18:53.634 --> 18:55.844
All right. Come on, love.
Can you go upstairs now, please?

18:55.928 --> 18:57.179
Go on. Off you go.

18:58.347 --> 18:59.598
-Good night.
-Good night.

19:05.437 --> 19:06.813
Thanks for letting me stay.

19:06.897 --> 19:08.398
She wanted to see you.

19:09.149 --> 19:11.777
-How are you?
-Good. Yeah.

19:14.071 --> 19:15.697
-You?
-Good. Yeah.

19:15.781 --> 19:18.242
Really good. Things are going good.

19:18.325 --> 19:21.787
I mean, Harper's just this really
positive person. So, yeah, it's all good.

19:22.329 --> 19:24.915
She's got, like, absolutely no time
for non-positive things.

19:24.998 --> 19:25.999
Freddy.

19:26.083 --> 19:28.210
Obviously, I have no emotional support,
but that's fine.

19:28.293 --> 19:29.920
It's fine as long as I don't...

19:30.003 --> 19:31.547
-Freddy.
-As long as I'm happy

19:31.630 --> 19:33.966
100% of the time, which I am.
So it's all good.

19:34.049 --> 19:35.676
Sure, it would be great if, like,

19:35.759 --> 19:38.637
she tried to just understand me
a tiny bit.

19:38.720 --> 19:40.472
I mean, I make the effort. Like...

19:40.556 --> 19:44.101
I bought those vegan trainers, and
I went on her ice cream tasting podcast.

19:44.184 --> 19:45.477
Freddy, you cannot do this.

19:45.561 --> 19:47.896
You cannot come to me
with your problems anymore.

19:47.980 --> 19:50.232
I am a person. I'm not just some

19:51.233 --> 19:52.818
help blob.

19:54.069 --> 19:55.070
I'm sorry.

19:57.197 --> 19:58.699
For everything.

20:01.827 --> 20:03.871
-That podcast is shit.
-I know.

20:03.954 --> 20:06.081
There's no peril.
All ice cream tastes nice.

20:06.164 --> 20:07.249
Exactly.

20:11.587 --> 20:13.297
Oh, God, you're such an idiot.

20:14.464 --> 20:16.967
Of course you're gonna feel old
if you go out with a young person.

20:17.050 --> 20:19.511
You wanna feel young,
you go out with an old person.

20:21.346 --> 20:24.474
You always went looking for your happiness
in the wrong places.

20:30.898 --> 20:33.692
You know there's no guarantee that
they're gonna choose them over us.

20:33.775 --> 20:35.194
-Please, Jase.
-There isn't. It's true--

20:35.277 --> 20:36.987
Why would those kids want to live with us?

20:37.070 --> 20:40.282
I don't wanna go back to our flat,
and all of our stuff is there.

20:43.619 --> 20:45.621
It's just so weird though, 'cause

20:47.039 --> 20:49.750
when I looked at them,
I really thought that I--

20:51.251 --> 20:52.920
I was looking at our children.

20:56.590 --> 20:57.758
I know.

20:59.843 --> 21:01.178
All right, come on.

21:01.762 --> 21:02.930
Let's go.

21:03.013 --> 21:05.057
No, Jase, it's not hooked on to--

21:05.557 --> 21:07.059
Why would you pull it up?

21:07.142 --> 21:11.063
Because it's a tree house,
and you're supposed to.

21:11.146 --> 21:12.314
What?

21:12.397 --> 21:13.649
No, you're not.

21:15.567 --> 21:18.612
-Don't worry. I'll just climb down.
-No! You-- It's too high.

21:18.695 --> 21:22.157
-It'll be fine. I'll just climb down.
-No, I've lost enough people today.

21:22.241 --> 21:23.742
-Let's ring someone.
-It's quite high.

21:23.825 --> 21:25.035
-Yes, it is.
-Yeah.

21:29.248 --> 21:31.333
-I've left my phone at home.
-Should I call Freddy?

21:31.416 --> 21:32.417
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

21:43.637 --> 21:44.638
No, nothing.

21:45.556 --> 21:46.890
-Try Erica.
-Yeah?

21:48.475 --> 21:49.560
For God's sake.

21:54.898 --> 21:56.066
No luck.

21:57.150 --> 21:58.193
Karen?

21:58.277 --> 21:59.611
Yeah, go on.

22:07.160 --> 22:08.579
I'm really glad you came.

22:12.749 --> 22:13.959
Daddy!

22:20.090 --> 22:21.258
Just give me a sec.

22:49.912 --> 22:50.913
Scott?

22:52.372 --> 22:53.373
Yeah.

23:05.844 --> 23:06.845
Yello.

23:09.264 --> 23:11.391
Ay up, there he is. Well done, mate.

23:11.475 --> 23:12.476
-Hello.
-Thank you.

23:12.559 --> 23:14.561
No problem. Where's...

23:14.645 --> 23:15.646
No Karen?

23:15.729 --> 23:18.941
Karen? Why would Karen be here?

23:21.610 --> 23:24.738
No, it's just a miscommunication.

23:24.821 --> 23:27.032
I know what I'm-- Yeah. No, that's fine.

23:28.659 --> 23:30.035
What's the plan?

23:30.118 --> 23:32.454
If you'd just chuck that up, mate,
we'll be golden.

23:32.538 --> 23:34.456
-Oh, yeah.
-Thank you.

23:34.540 --> 23:35.791
That's it, is it?

23:39.628 --> 23:42.673
The gate's locked, guys.
You have to jump over it.

23:43.549 --> 23:44.800
We know.

23:49.471 --> 23:50.681
The lights. Hang on.

23:59.523 --> 24:02.234
I'm sorry for acting so crazy.

24:03.402 --> 24:05.571
-That's okay.
-It isn't.

24:05.654 --> 24:07.114
-I like it.
-Oh, yeah?

24:08.031 --> 24:10.868
Makes me feel less lonely
when you act crazy too.

24:14.913 --> 24:17.666
We can't compete
with Ben and Denise, Jason.

24:17.749 --> 24:20.711
Your dad's homemade bedroom
isn't going to change that.

24:22.379 --> 24:23.964
We need to take this down.

24:24.548 --> 24:26.800
-I really don't want to.
-I know.

24:28.260 --> 24:30.929
But these kids deserve
more than we can give them.

24:31.763 --> 24:34.641
The first thing in their new life
shouldn't be a compromise, should it?

24:34.725 --> 24:36.018
Yeah, I know.

24:37.519 --> 24:39.438
Maybe when we get the fairy lights up--

24:39.521 --> 24:40.606
Jase.

24:43.192 --> 24:45.986
If these were our kids,
we'd do anything for them.

24:47.487 --> 24:49.323
This is one thing that we can do for them.

24:49.406 --> 24:50.532
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

25:01.084 --> 25:02.920
Okay. Here you go.

25:03.670 --> 25:05.339
What am I meant to do with that?

26:29.965 --> 26:31.216
Oh, shit.
