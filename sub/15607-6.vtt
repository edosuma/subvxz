00:08.727 --> 00:09.927
Oh?

00:11.367 --> 00:13.365
- Wanted to say good night.
- Mm-mmm.

00:14.237 --> 00:16.633
- Who am I?
- The sandman, Pappy.

00:16.644 --> 00:19.280
- Yeah, and what do I bring?
- Sweet dreams.

00:19.291 --> 00:21.234
Yeah, well, take them and sleep.

00:21.234 --> 00:22.963
Say good night to our guest.

00:22.974 --> 00:24.807
Good night, Mr. Bennet.

00:25.974 --> 00:27.174
Go now.

00:29.241 --> 00:30.936
Do not wake me when you come, Don.

00:30.947 --> 00:33.802
Well, I would not bank on it, woman.

00:52.574 --> 00:54.613
It is a thing to be happy, Don.

00:55.187 --> 00:56.387
It is.

00:56.398 --> 00:57.722
And you are.

00:58.302 --> 00:59.624
I am.

01:01.794 --> 01:03.802
There's no secret to it, Ben.

01:04.607 --> 01:05.951
There is only this.

01:06.762 --> 01:10.018
Do not care for all but what
you may throw your arms about.

01:10.814 --> 01:14.514
Decide who that may be.
Forget what remains beyond.

01:15.904 --> 01:18.141
That is no counsel for a copper.

01:18.525 --> 01:20.009
I never said it was.

01:20.922 --> 01:26.434
It is counsel for a man, however, who
would know what life is, not the other.

_

03:02.905 --> 03:08.143
See, my darling, how we all like
to feel a man in uniform beneath us?

03:10.560 --> 03:12.578
Do you blush on my account, Drum?

03:12.702 --> 03:14.314
It is coarse.

03:14.522 --> 03:17.527
And you are about as far from
coarse as a man might imagine, Tilda.

03:17.538 --> 03:20.270
You know, Drum, you must not
make a princess out of me.

03:20.281 --> 03:22.785
But that is the way I feel
about you, however, Tilda...

03:23.368 --> 03:24.873
a princess to me.

03:24.884 --> 03:26.492
Then you must stop.

03:27.257 --> 03:31.186
There is something I have learned, and
learned to my cost, Samuel Drummond.

03:31.462 --> 03:33.841
It is that life is not a fairy tale,

03:34.274 --> 03:37.607
and that those who seek to
make it one too often do so

03:37.618 --> 03:42.141
for the real and felt unhappiness of
their actual lives. Do you understand?

03:42.152 --> 03:43.713
I am not unhappy, Mathilda.

03:43.724 --> 03:47.405
I could make you so, however.
I could make so and fast.

03:48.344 --> 03:52.857
There are no princesses and
no monsters, only humans...

03:53.167 --> 03:56.263
their flesh and bones
and all too broken hearts.

03:57.491 --> 04:00.158
I am fond of you because you are real.

04:00.495 --> 04:04.553
And I can not find anything
hidden or broken about you.

04:04.554 --> 04:08.015
You must be fond of me
because I, too, am real.

04:08.477 --> 04:09.964
Do you see?

04:10.453 --> 04:11.702
I do.

04:14.178 --> 04:15.378
Real.

04:23.627 --> 04:25.944
Paper! Paper!

04:26.625 --> 04:29.145
Whitechapel beast slays again.

04:29.413 --> 04:31.259
Jewish immigrant murdered.

04:34.484 --> 04:36.170
- Thank you, sir.
- _

04:36.754 --> 04:38.977
Paper! Paper!

04:39.746 --> 04:41.757
Jewish immigrant murdered.

04:44.080 --> 04:45.280
Where is she?

04:45.291 --> 04:46.861
- Excuse me, sir.
- Sit.

04:53.724 --> 04:55.187
Come, Inspector Drake.

04:55.198 --> 04:56.520
I should have known.

04:57.127 --> 05:01.056
Edmund Reid betrays his badge,
his uniform, his brother men.

05:01.067 --> 05:04.478
No, I told you, Inspector Drake.
And you would not hear it from me.

05:04.489 --> 05:08.136
I will not stand idle whilst
Whitechapel falls beneath terror...

05:08.147 --> 05:12.111
a terror in which, I believe, Assistant
Commissioner Dove to be implicated.

05:12.446 --> 05:14.687
Now, this will break him from his cover.

05:14.698 --> 05:16.367
And break our good name alongside it.

05:16.378 --> 05:18.313
Our good name be damned.

05:20.723 --> 05:22.479
Miss Castello, will you show him?

05:36.333 --> 05:39.434
Here. You may recognise Leon Ratovski,

05:39.570 --> 05:44.139
this image recorded the day he led
his people out of the Russian Empire.

05:45.766 --> 05:47.760
What are these? Towns? Villages?

05:47.771 --> 05:50.739
- They are shtetl.
- They are the towns and villages

05:50.750 --> 05:54.273
where the Jewish people of Russia
were tolerated to live... for a while.

05:54.284 --> 05:56.699
Until living there became intolerable.

05:56.710 --> 05:59.388
These, then, their
journeys as they fled,

05:59.555 --> 06:02.232
those that made their
eventual way to London.

06:04.907 --> 06:06.107
Go on.

06:07.145 --> 06:11.741
I first heard the name Ratovski two
years ago from one who followed him...

06:11.752 --> 06:16.345
a woman, the only surviving member
of her family to have reached London.

06:16.689 --> 06:20.200
And though her grief was still
great, so was her gratitude

06:21.196 --> 06:24.491
to the man, the rabbi, who
had led their caravan west.

06:24.657 --> 06:29.264
I recorded the name, Leon Ratovski,
and then put that record aside.

06:30.423 --> 06:32.489
Until the time you heard his name again.

06:32.500 --> 06:34.085
The victim of a murder,

06:34.321 --> 06:36.422
about which you, Mr. Drake, would reveal

06:36.433 --> 06:38.739
barely more than a
sentence of information

06:38.750 --> 06:41.111
until the murderer
was named, Isaac Bloom,

06:41.122 --> 06:43.658
another Jewish man to
have made such a journey.

06:43.669 --> 06:46.498
Yet still, although I make
daily requests for details,

06:46.509 --> 06:48.611
none are forthcoming from you, sir,

06:48.622 --> 06:51.859
or your superior at Scotland
Yard, Assistant Commissioner Dove,

06:52.176 --> 06:55.093
who proceeds to injunct
all details of your case.

06:57.539 --> 07:00.314
I am afraid I am perverse.

07:00.969 --> 07:04.718
Being barred from asking questions
has a tendency to make ask more.

07:05.529 --> 07:08.669
This week last, I travelled
to Paris where his friends

07:08.680 --> 07:11.525
at the Sorbonne allowed me
to remove these photographs

07:12.447 --> 07:15.048
and these.

07:18.798 --> 07:20.998
They are his diaries, Bennet.

07:21.283 --> 07:22.638
And you've read these?

07:22.639 --> 07:24.499
They are in Ukrainian. He cannot.

07:24.500 --> 07:27.374
- Well, then, they must be translated.
- They are being so.

07:42.529 --> 07:46.486
Rabbi Ratovski's own account
of a journey at the head of 150

07:46.497 --> 07:49.748
men, women, and children...
a community of Jews,

07:49.749 --> 07:52.208
then supplemented by a further diaspora,

07:52.209 --> 07:55.392
Christians fleeing north
from the Balkan peninsula.

07:55.627 --> 07:58.758
In the Russian empire, the
czars drove out the Jews.

07:58.759 --> 08:01.668
In the Ottoman, the Sultan
drove out the Christians,

08:01.669 --> 08:04.668
peoples leaving all
they have known behind,

08:04.669 --> 08:08.438
massing, driving west for salvation.

08:08.575 --> 08:12.842
It is a hard road, however. And
this Ratovski's, the hardest.

08:25.940 --> 08:28.648
In daylight, breaking camp, I see them,

08:29.049 --> 08:32.364
perhaps 50 yards from us,
watching through the trees...

08:32.994 --> 08:34.739
a wolf pack.

08:35.400 --> 08:37.698
I say nothing to the group. We walk on.

08:38.087 --> 08:39.291
The whole day, they follow.

08:39.302 --> 08:42.558
They are to the south of us,
perhaps an hour later to the north.

08:43.080 --> 08:44.483
We camp at nightfall.

08:44.494 --> 08:48.498
I instruct fires to be built on
our perimeter, and I am asked why.

08:48.509 --> 08:52.328
I do not need to find an answer
because that is when they begin to howl.

08:53.157 --> 08:56.548
The first night, they take
two... an elderly couple.

08:56.549 --> 08:58.878
We know nothing of this
until their screams erupt

08:58.879 --> 09:01.170
From the darkness beyond our fires.

09:01.659 --> 09:04.033
They scream for what
feels like many hours.

09:04.549 --> 09:07.915
By morning, there is nothing left
of them except the blood in the snow.

09:09.158 --> 09:12.122
The following night, they come
again, but now they take five,

09:12.545 --> 09:14.437
two young girls among them. Again,

09:14.448 --> 09:16.387
we must listen to their screams.

09:16.398 --> 09:19.348
And so it proceeds, day by day,
as we walk through the forest.

09:19.359 --> 09:22.935
We see them close, their
pups gambolling alongside.

09:23.281 --> 09:25.316
And each night, they
attack. And we listen to our

09:25.327 --> 09:28.034
wives, our husbands, our
parents, our children screaming

09:28.045 --> 09:31.917
and imagine that one night soon it will
be ourselves going beneath their jaws.

09:34.559 --> 09:37.210
Two weeks we walk through
the forest like this.

09:37.589 --> 09:40.395
And on the last night, however,
the wolves take a woman,

09:40.406 --> 09:43.415
A Christian woman, Galuba.

09:44.447 --> 09:47.075
I remember her name
because she was the last,

09:47.164 --> 09:51.130
and also because her two sons
attempted to fight the animals.

09:51.141 --> 09:53.172
Perhaps for this reason,
the wolves did not

09:53.183 --> 09:56.753
remove her corpse, instead
left her there in the snow,

09:56.764 --> 10:00.218
her insides all about her,
and the youngest of her sons

10:00.219 --> 10:03.329
still clutching at her cold body.

10:07.227 --> 10:12.742
Ratovski told Isaac Bloom that he
had come to London the right a wrong.

10:12.753 --> 10:16.961
And he would say that this
wrong constituted an abandonment.

10:16.972 --> 10:19.358
The later entries, his arrival in Paris,

10:19.369 --> 10:21.908
he... he talks of being
broken, unable to continue,

10:21.909 --> 10:23.840
unable to lead his people further.

10:23.851 --> 10:26.499
So the caravan breaks up, men, women,
and children going where they may.

10:26.500 --> 10:29.358
And some we know, correct,
Miss Castello, to London.

10:29.359 --> 10:33.258
So perhaps these two brothers were
forced to go on without Ratovski.

10:33.269 --> 10:35.268
And was this that abandonment?

10:35.279 --> 10:38.131
Two small boys alone and
orphaned, their memories,

10:38.142 --> 10:39.636
who they felt themselves to be,

10:39.647 --> 10:42.045
shaped and fathered by the
beast they met in that forest.

10:42.056 --> 10:45.758
Now grown to adulthood.
Homo homoni lupus esto.

10:45.759 --> 10:48.298
Man is wolf to man.

10:49.809 --> 10:51.933
Before Ratovski was found, weeks before,

10:51.944 --> 10:54.524
do you recall, Deborah,
the talk had started...

10:54.535 --> 10:57.979
a figure seen on rooftops
watching those of this community,

10:57.990 --> 11:00.229
what they called the Whitechapel golem.

11:00.240 --> 11:04.155
So what has become a rabid
violence begins with a surveillance?

11:04.166 --> 11:05.992
Like the wolves stalking the caravan.

11:06.003 --> 11:08.058
Two boys, two Christian boys,

11:08.059 --> 11:09.838
the sons of the wolves' last victim,

11:09.839 --> 11:11.728
are given shelter by a Jewish community.

11:11.729 --> 11:17.291
Whilst in their care, they are
exposed to this bestial horror.

11:17.302 --> 11:20.065
And now in adulthood,
one of them seeks to visit

11:20.076 --> 11:22.218
the same horror within
the same community.

11:22.229 --> 11:25.948
So is Ratovski brought
here to tend, to counsel,

11:25.959 --> 11:28.032
only to fall beneath
the jaws of the wolf?

11:28.043 --> 11:31.655
Invited by one brother to
attempt the healing of the other?

11:35.450 --> 11:36.949
The woman's name?

11:38.349 --> 11:42.728
Do you recall a bird-seller who had a
store off the back of Fashion Street.

11:42.729 --> 11:44.602
I once brought Rose lovebirds from him.

11:44.613 --> 11:46.477
- I do. I remember him.
- He was a gyppy.

11:46.488 --> 11:49.122
Made great play of it,
his Balkan Romani roots.

11:52.380 --> 11:57.281
"Goluba", was the word
he used for a dove.

11:58.740 --> 12:03.499
He makes his mother's name
English, redefines himself with it.

12:08.079 --> 12:11.951
Miss Castello, you will
now set your curiosity

12:11.962 --> 12:14.528
to Assistant Police
Commissioner Augustus Dove.

12:14.529 --> 12:17.071
Find him. Follow him. Report to me.

12:17.229 --> 12:19.454
It will be more than
a book you will write,

12:20.221 --> 12:22.894
and more than our good
name will be bankrupted.

12:22.905 --> 12:27.542
He will show the world a darkness
sat the heart of Scotland Yard itself.

12:51.843 --> 12:55.326
We all knew it, when we
were all scraps together.

12:55.771 --> 12:59.372
We all knew you would become
the model of what a man might be.

13:00.365 --> 13:05.188
Even when you were a boy, Augustus Dove.

13:05.495 --> 13:10.017
We girls would fight and scratch
for who one day might be your woman.

13:12.013 --> 13:15.231
How is it you're alone, Augustus?

13:18.606 --> 13:20.149
I do not know, Rose.

13:22.445 --> 13:24.316
All I know is it saddens me.

13:25.140 --> 13:27.239
It saddens me something fearful.

13:28.739 --> 13:31.268
Do not be sad, Augustus.

13:31.734 --> 13:33.062
Do not be.

13:33.476 --> 13:39.304
There is too much confusion in the world
for a young, handsome man to be sad.

13:42.254 --> 13:44.043
Not too far, Connor.

13:46.981 --> 13:48.808
Rose, may I ask you something?

13:49.890 --> 13:51.326
Of course, you may.

13:52.671 --> 13:56.366
Your words to me, your
recent words of Miss Hart

13:56.377 --> 13:59.888
and how she and Mr. Reid have
collaborated on some of act of evil...

14:01.319 --> 14:03.245
You said I should keep my secrets.

14:03.256 --> 14:05.290
I did. I know.

14:05.301 --> 14:09.974
Well, who could blame him for
it when it... his daughter.

14:11.046 --> 14:12.769
It was his child.

14:12.780 --> 14:16.524
- But Susan... what she did...
- Rose, forgive me. I do not follow.

14:19.170 --> 14:22.803
It was her father, Theodore Swift,

14:23.380 --> 14:26.644
her own flesh and blood. And God help,

14:26.655 --> 14:30.076
Bennet stood by and watched
as they put him in that cellar,

14:30.086 --> 14:32.914
the same cellar that Reid
popped that child-stealer's

14:32.925 --> 14:34.810
head open on a stone pillar.

14:36.541 --> 14:39.065
Oh, but I am faithless.

14:39.189 --> 14:40.800
You are not, Rose.

14:41.119 --> 14:42.870
You are nothing of the kind.

14:43.339 --> 14:46.473
You hold to what is right and
true, not to lies and secrecy.

14:47.779 --> 14:49.403
And murder, Rose.

14:50.574 --> 14:52.192
What they did was murder.

15:23.599 --> 15:27.041
Two men for three vases.

15:28.019 --> 15:30.038
Does that represent a good deal?

15:30.039 --> 15:35.254
Oi, I'll tell you again,
that blood is on my hands.

15:37.739 --> 15:40.094
Now, we may waste no time.

15:40.105 --> 15:42.411
Yes, I understand that, Croker.

15:42.659 --> 15:45.351
Then take one vase... only one, mind...

15:45.362 --> 15:48.374
to that fence off Radcliffe
Highway and get your prize.

15:48.385 --> 15:50.120
I got little choice, do I?

15:50.603 --> 15:52.888
You've arranged our berths, then?

15:52.889 --> 15:55.350
Boston the best I can
do in such short order.

15:55.361 --> 15:57.978
- Boston will serve fine.
- Then you bring me my money,

15:57.989 --> 16:00.591
hook your child and I
shall waive your fee.

16:00.602 --> 16:03.807
Just a, uh, word,
Croker, before I leave?

16:03.818 --> 16:05.137
Come.

16:08.843 --> 16:10.477
That's your boy, is is not?

16:10.488 --> 16:13.603
He is. Not my blood, but he's my boy.

16:14.199 --> 16:16.356
You know what your
boy's been about of late?

16:17.986 --> 16:20.528
Now most other weeks, I'd
just shoot them here and now.

16:20.539 --> 16:23.378
But this ain't other weeks.
So I only ask you this.

16:23.603 --> 16:28.049
If I leave my wife with you for
another two hours, is she safe?

16:28.899 --> 16:31.399
Well, what is it you
accuse him of, Captain?

16:31.410 --> 16:34.238
I cannot vouch for her safety
if I do not know this...

16:34.239 --> 16:36.477
Now you know goddamn
well what the threat is.

16:36.488 --> 16:39.589
Now what he's done, I can only
leave that on your conscience, Abel.

16:39.600 --> 16:43.773
But you vouch for her
safety. And you do it now.

16:45.829 --> 16:48.277
- She will be safe.
- On your life, Croker.

16:48.956 --> 16:50.156
On my life.

16:50.167 --> 16:52.998
She ain't, he even gives her a stir,

16:52.999 --> 16:56.084
I will hunt him and kill him, and
not before I've shot you first.

16:57.179 --> 16:59.846
- You hear me?
- I hear you.

17:07.108 --> 17:08.463
What gives, Abel?

17:08.875 --> 17:10.075
Oh...

17:13.671 --> 17:16.422
Take this to the station
house on Leman Street.

17:19.648 --> 17:20.877
Sir?

17:21.329 --> 17:22.605
What is it, Sergeant?

17:22.780 --> 17:24.728
Our dead room reaches capacity.

17:24.729 --> 17:26.608
The cage on the customs
warehouse on Cutler Street

17:26.608 --> 17:27.926
was blown up in last night...

17:27.938 --> 17:29.643
- two guards killed.
- What thieved?

17:29.654 --> 17:31.212
Three porcelain vases.

17:31.961 --> 17:34.084
Well, it's your case,
Thatcher. You see it through.

17:34.095 --> 17:37.106
Sirs, I think you must see this.

17:40.172 --> 17:42.809
- Captain Jackson?
- Not in his rooms, Inspector.

17:42.820 --> 17:44.386
Usual gin and flop houses?

17:44.397 --> 17:47.751
Men searched, returned without
him. We keep looking however.

17:48.049 --> 17:50.334
So it was you who has stripped them?

17:50.679 --> 17:52.978
- No, sir.
- That was myself.

17:54.819 --> 17:58.757
Sergeant Thatcher found the
action, uh, not to his taste.

18:01.414 --> 18:04.077
It... it was the wounding, sir.

18:06.249 --> 18:09.658
Blood spilling from
the same piece of them.

18:09.659 --> 18:11.364
Upper left thorax.

18:13.647 --> 18:16.268
You see, I think the instinct accurate.

18:17.611 --> 18:21.996
It's the same wounding, when
he must kill for necessity.

18:23.959 --> 18:28.825
These, Mr. Nadelman and
Mr. Ratovski before him.

18:28.836 --> 18:32.658
This... this is the animal unleashed.

18:33.363 --> 18:36.837
Mr. Reid, sir, which animal?

18:43.648 --> 18:45.167
This is fine work.

18:45.523 --> 18:48.275
But I think you both must leave us now.

18:49.030 --> 18:50.333
What, no?

18:50.889 --> 18:52.133
Inspector?

18:52.279 --> 18:53.979
Get out, Thatcher.

19:08.715 --> 19:12.658
Do we believe Augustus Dove about the
thieving of Japanese porcelain also?

19:12.659 --> 19:14.859
And more besides.

19:16.829 --> 19:18.546
The world beside.

19:27.119 --> 19:29.556
Who here carries the biggest truncheon?

19:30.759 --> 19:32.997
What is it you want, small fry?

19:33.959 --> 19:36.060
- You, is it?
- Come on.

19:36.071 --> 19:40.121
- Oi, I only came to run you a note.
- Then give it.

19:49.569 --> 19:51.848
Tip off. Cutler Street job.

19:52.014 --> 19:53.722
Knows where the items to be fenced.

19:53.733 --> 19:55.820
Drum! What do you do?

19:55.831 --> 19:57.646
- Well, inspectors.
- Inspectors be bolloxed.

19:57.657 --> 19:58.939
This is our bloody collar.

20:18.913 --> 20:21.363
_

20:22.309 --> 20:23.546
Parker?

20:24.959 --> 20:28.268
No. I'm Thatcher.

20:28.269 --> 20:29.634
Who...

20:30.401 --> 20:31.601
Thatcher, what...

20:31.612 --> 20:34.360
Bloody thieving, conniving,

20:34.865 --> 20:40.006
backstabbing Americans.

20:40.017 --> 20:41.658
God damn it.

20:49.580 --> 20:51.834
You're really going to
make me do this, huh?

21:32.015 --> 21:33.970
Now there's some
morphine about the place.

21:33.981 --> 21:37.781
Just do me a favour and fix me up with
some brandy because my head is broke...

21:49.529 --> 21:51.951
Everything you know... now.

21:53.284 --> 21:55.103
I know you punch like a choir boy.

22:06.239 --> 22:09.683
There's a rope with
your name on it and soon.

22:10.848 --> 22:13.510
Look, Drake, I'd really
like to help, really I would.

22:13.521 --> 22:15.168
But I don't know nothing.

22:15.169 --> 22:18.301
So why don't you be a good little
nurse and go and get me my morphine.

22:18.312 --> 22:19.799
Bennet, Bennet, Bennet, Bennet.

22:22.671 --> 22:23.877
Oh, what's wrong?

22:23.888 --> 22:26.048
Your two stars still crossed, boys?

22:30.675 --> 22:32.626
Why, you're out of conditioning, Reid.

22:38.127 --> 22:39.327
See?

22:41.679 --> 22:42.907
See?

22:45.307 --> 22:50.838
Now I'm not no surgeon,
nor no Pinkerton.

22:50.839 --> 22:52.728
But I'm no fool neither.

22:52.729 --> 22:54.973
These knife wounds are the same.

22:54.984 --> 22:58.482
And as you, with such
precision, pointed out,

22:58.879 --> 23:02.628
He who killed Thomas Gower, killed
this poor immigrant, Nadelman.

23:02.629 --> 23:04.413
Killed Leon Ratovski also.

23:04.793 --> 23:09.991
And now, I believe, has put his
knife between these two men's ribs

23:10.002 --> 23:14.404
during a robbery which you, in
one way or another, have partaken.

23:16.049 --> 23:20.791
Anyway you choose to slice it,
Captain, you're up to your guts in this.

23:22.459 --> 23:24.887
So you tell me who done this!

23:37.146 --> 23:39.236
Just pass me a smoke, will ya?

24:08.209 --> 24:11.064
Were you part of this
robbery last night?

24:11.899 --> 24:15.856
If you were not, how did you
get your hands on this vase?

24:17.469 --> 24:19.755
Well, that's a good
many questions, Reid.

24:20.471 --> 24:22.298
Which one's your favourite?

24:25.639 --> 24:29.381
Despite your self-interest,
I know that you are not

24:29.392 --> 24:33.979
the stripe of man that let others
suffer while you might instead help.

24:34.673 --> 24:37.891
Now we know not how,
but Augustus Dove himself

24:37.902 --> 24:40.006
is somehow also tangled within all.

24:40.017 --> 24:45.473
So I ask you again, only help.

24:59.299 --> 25:01.598
I only wish I could, Reid.

25:09.291 --> 25:12.851
You know, I'm glad of something.

25:14.309 --> 25:17.571
The man you were when we
first met, the man of war,

25:17.582 --> 25:20.481
man of dread, his least fighting dog,

25:20.699 --> 25:24.861
and now all that you have
constructed about yourself now, Drake,

25:25.538 --> 25:30.394
is a man of peace, a man of hope...
it's a relief for me to see it.

25:32.439 --> 25:36.507
Just how brittle a carapace that was,

25:37.613 --> 25:41.158
how little a man can change.

25:44.798 --> 25:46.315
Inspectors...

25:51.024 --> 25:53.311
sir, she has brung herself here.

25:53.749 --> 25:56.432
Uh, Miss Castello,
sir. She asks after you.

26:04.264 --> 26:07.135
Have two men lock this whoreson down.

26:24.209 --> 26:25.755
My office.

26:27.409 --> 26:30.071
It is a rare blend our
surgeon's taken to smoking.

26:30.082 --> 26:32.538
One cannot imagine its importers
being that many and varied.

26:32.549 --> 26:34.352
So get on the line to the
shipping office at the Western

26:34.363 --> 26:36.912
find out who lumps such
tobacco ashore for them.

26:39.789 --> 26:41.133
You're sure?

26:41.689 --> 26:43.080
I'm afraid so.

26:49.709 --> 26:50.998
Leave us now.

26:56.826 --> 27:00.962
They are friends, are they not,
from childhood, schooled together.

27:00.973 --> 27:03.749
Such friends do not walk arm in arm.

27:09.489 --> 27:13.019
Do not care for ought but what
you may throw your arms about.

27:14.412 --> 27:16.743
It will not serve anyone,
least of all yourself,

27:16.754 --> 27:19.487
to reach a conclusion that
you have not seen first-hand

27:19.498 --> 27:21.181
and which you cannot prove.

27:21.929 --> 27:23.699
I see your rage.

27:24.549 --> 27:26.536
I do, but do not feed it.

27:26.547 --> 27:32.008
Leave me for now to join this robbery
with Mr. Dove and you go home, Bennet.

27:32.019 --> 27:33.904
Go home with love in your heart.

27:51.163 --> 27:52.593
Yes? Drummond?

27:52.604 --> 27:55.165
Three different merchants,
two different wharf sites.

27:58.669 --> 28:01.558
Only, uh, here's a point
of interest, Mr. Reid.

28:01.559 --> 28:03.727
Shipping office reports
an identical inquiry

28:03.738 --> 28:05.411
taking place a couple of weeks back.

28:05.579 --> 28:08.458
A fellow named Probin, prison doctor.

28:46.597 --> 28:47.920
Egyptian.

28:49.219 --> 28:52.048
Nutty, cut with sweetness.

28:52.049 --> 28:58.783
They're strong and rare,
only a few importers.

28:58.990 --> 29:01.709
It's a clear trail to its source,

29:02.755 --> 29:05.686
a trail stepped by
another in recent times,

29:06.491 --> 29:09.049
that doctor out of Newgate.

29:11.275 --> 29:12.725
Remember his name?

29:14.999 --> 29:16.640
It was Probin.

29:19.399 --> 29:21.821
He ministered to your wife, I believe,

29:25.189 --> 29:30.612
before she died... or did not die,

29:30.789 --> 29:32.992
if Rose Drake is to be believed.

29:36.766 --> 29:38.314
I only mention this out of fellowship

29:38.325 --> 29:40.472
and due to the fact
that time presses. And...

29:41.049 --> 29:44.476
and I believe you may be able
to save me a diversion or two.

29:45.066 --> 29:48.675
Which of the three wharves that land
this tobacco should I go to first?

29:48.686 --> 29:51.518
- And what I would I find there?
- Reid, I think you know what it is.

29:51.529 --> 29:53.808
You asked me that. It ain't just
a name I'm going to give you.

29:53.809 --> 29:56.844
- I do. I must.
- Then in fellowship, don't ask it.

29:56.855 --> 30:00.530
And yet, I have no notion of
what it is you speak, Reid.

30:11.279 --> 30:17.751
Reid, you be careful down there.

30:18.473 --> 30:22.709
- What dangers do I face?
- Plenty.

30:38.428 --> 30:39.633
No.

30:39.771 --> 30:42.000
No, no, no.

30:43.999 --> 30:46.256
Ah! No.

30:53.743 --> 30:59.189
_

31:19.143 --> 31:22.445
This your sarcophagus, is it, madam?

31:23.569 --> 31:25.709
Where you have come to in your death?

31:29.170 --> 31:36.463
And who else to break me from
my tomb but you, Mr. Reid?

31:43.009 --> 31:44.655
It is fortunate...

31:45.184 --> 31:48.276
that I am in the habit of
believing the evidence with my eyes.

31:48.929 --> 31:50.257
I might, like Rose Drake,

31:50.268 --> 31:54.304
consider my wits lost to me having
watched you fall from the scaffold.

31:55.059 --> 31:59.126
At some point in time, I should be
very interested to know how you did it,

31:59.137 --> 32:01.149
although I have some idea

32:01.160 --> 32:04.426
given that your husband is
currently in irons at Leman Street.

32:10.159 --> 32:15.758
Tip off, apparently, apprehended in
the process of selling stolen goods,

32:15.769 --> 32:18.016
the anticipated profit
from which to provide

32:18.027 --> 32:20.662
the wherewithal for your
further flight, I imagine,

32:21.433 --> 32:23.969
an escape of ruthlessness and ingenuity,

32:23.980 --> 32:26.250
one that might have been
worthy of you, madam.

32:26.729 --> 32:28.092
Escape?

32:31.823 --> 32:34.005
It is a fine fancy,

32:36.588 --> 32:38.237
but no more than that.

32:39.989 --> 32:44.327
And you, Mr. Reid, a
man equally resurrected,

32:44.879 --> 32:47.747
equally powerless to leave a place,

32:48.629 --> 32:51.628
come to show me my truth once more.

32:55.989 --> 32:57.670
Yourself, myself,

32:58.856 --> 33:02.746
attached to Whitechapel as if
by lead weights on a riverbed.

33:08.049 --> 33:09.857
The betrayal of my husband,

33:11.033 --> 33:15.179
it is the same communication
that has brought you in here now?

33:15.190 --> 33:18.292
No, merely police work.

33:19.639 --> 33:21.326
And who your betrayer?

33:21.789 --> 33:23.708
The wharfinger here, Croker?

33:23.879 --> 33:25.539
So it would seem.

33:37.642 --> 33:42.138
- My son, will I see my son?
- Not of current relevance.

33:42.662 --> 33:45.206
I am sure some visitation
might be arranged

33:45.217 --> 33:48.989
before... well, before
the law of this land

33:49.000 --> 33:51.656
makes one further attempt
to see you punished.

33:52.327 --> 33:55.998
I would have accepted it, my hanging.

33:55.999 --> 33:58.264
You must understand that, Mr. Reid.

33:58.629 --> 34:02.633
I would have given my life in
recompose for all I have taken

34:02.902 --> 34:05.131
and... and done it with peace.

34:07.273 --> 34:09.627
But they let me raise my boy.

34:12.041 --> 34:16.527
And once... once I had known him,

34:21.071 --> 34:23.201
I could not relinquish that.

34:23.909 --> 34:26.384
Thus this most recent thieving of yours,

34:27.559 --> 34:31.197
dead men at your door yet again
in your pursuit of freedom.

34:31.199 --> 34:33.299
And I would mourn them.

34:36.243 --> 34:38.777
Now also their mourning
barely worth the saying of.

34:38.789 --> 34:41.810
No, then who was it?

34:43.203 --> 34:44.710
Who was it put the knife in?

34:49.985 --> 34:51.936
It is you. It is you.

34:51.947 --> 34:54.224
No, no, you take this
man's life, Nathaniel,

34:54.235 --> 34:55.623
you must take mine first.

34:55.634 --> 34:58.676
You know what it's like to protect.
And I must protect him. I must.

34:58.689 --> 35:00.130
Nathaniel, is it?

35:01.131 --> 35:03.870
What was it before? What was
it when the wolves came for you?

35:05.330 --> 35:08.067
- Who is he?
- He's Reid. He's my friend.

35:08.078 --> 35:09.909
- He's police, is he not?
- He is.

35:09.920 --> 35:13.269
You, you are the younger, you who
laid beside your mother in the snow.

35:13.280 --> 35:15.600
And who is the older, Nathaniel?

35:16.143 --> 35:19.913
You tell me. I... I believe I know.
But you tell me. You confirm it.

35:19.924 --> 35:22.819
Did you run to him? Did you
confess what you'd done to Ratovski?

35:23.536 --> 35:27.008
I'm sorry, Miss Susan. I'm sorry.

35:27.009 --> 35:29.036
Wait! Wait!

35:43.063 --> 35:45.777
Half an hour, Augustus, tea and cake.

35:45.796 --> 35:47.090
Thank you.

35:47.389 --> 35:48.758
Half an hour.

35:55.499 --> 35:58.404
Mr. Drake, I thought to
deliver your wife home.

36:01.239 --> 36:04.724
What is it you thought to
deliver her from, Mr. Dove?

36:05.219 --> 36:08.893
Bennet, you know full
well we are friends.

36:10.559 --> 36:14.415
Should I not accept a carriage
ride home when all about is uproar?

36:14.839 --> 36:19.588
- It is as Rose says, Inspector.
- Mrs. Drake, she's Mrs. Drake to you.

36:21.399 --> 36:25.117
As Mrs. Drake has said,
these are dangerous days.

36:25.128 --> 36:28.185
And if it is in my gift to afford you
a measure of peace by returning your...

36:28.453 --> 36:29.868
Bennet!

36:29.869 --> 36:31.193
Augustus.

36:32.112 --> 36:33.312
Ah!

36:33.781 --> 36:36.124
Get him away. Get the boy out, Rose.

36:36.135 --> 36:38.530
Wh... want me to take his eyes away?

36:38.541 --> 36:40.532
Spare your shame for you? I will not.

36:40.543 --> 36:42.118
On your head be it then, woman.

36:42.241 --> 36:45.284
Your own selfish needs and I a
slave to each and every one of them.

36:45.295 --> 36:46.495
And now this.

36:49.248 --> 36:50.538
Stop it!

36:51.368 --> 36:52.866
Why you...

36:54.174 --> 36:57.043
- Mm.
- Did you let him touch you?

36:57.931 --> 37:00.865
Have you... have you
taken him to our bed?

37:00.876 --> 37:02.438
No, Bennet.

37:11.534 --> 37:13.377
Perhaps she speaks the truth.

37:16.019 --> 37:18.406
But what of your truth, hey?

37:21.169 --> 37:22.488
Bennet.

37:23.079 --> 37:27.991
You have camouflaged yourself
to me with great skill, sir.

37:29.114 --> 37:31.824
But there is a ripe stink about you now.

37:33.056 --> 37:34.427
We have it in the air.

37:34.438 --> 37:37.478
And we are coming for you, Mr. Dove.

37:58.484 --> 38:02.743
Oh, what will happen, Augustus?

38:02.754 --> 38:04.053
All will be well.

38:04.486 --> 38:05.906
My health on it.

38:06.729 --> 38:10.586
You allow it, I will build high
walls to make you and your child safe.

38:11.989 --> 38:15.076
Only you must choose
a side now, my Rose.

38:17.139 --> 38:21.221
The cellar, where may I find it?

38:26.219 --> 38:28.666
You know already, Augustus.

38:30.444 --> 38:33.178
It was beneath that curiosity shop.

40:07.642 --> 40:09.563
Book her, Sergeant Drummond.

40:10.119 --> 40:11.643
Yes, Mr. Reid.

40:12.686 --> 40:13.889
Name?

40:13.900 --> 40:15.287
Susan Hart.

40:15.298 --> 40:17.033
True name.

40:19.709 --> 40:20.909
Swift.

40:22.155 --> 40:23.750
Caitlin Swift.

40:27.338 --> 40:29.874
Inspector Drake, sir.

40:30.438 --> 40:33.418
Please, sir. There is a
unit at Westminster Manor.

40:33.419 --> 40:36.638
Yard uniforms, A-Division,
sir, over 50 of 'em.

40:37.504 --> 40:40.344
They've sealed up the Compton
Estate on Sander Street,

40:40.355 --> 40:42.678
and they're clearing out the tenants.

40:51.089 --> 40:52.589
Arrest warrant.

40:52.799 --> 40:56.354
Inspectors Reid and Drake
to be apprehended and held

40:56.365 --> 40:58.762
on the order of Assistant
Commissioner Dove.

41:06.610 --> 41:08.086
_

41:11.235 --> 41:13.267
_

41:18.634 --> 41:20.556
_

41:25.192 --> 41:27.793
_

41:29.114 --> 41:34.102
_

41:35.085 --> 41:38.719
_

41:55.913 --> 41:57.113
There.

42:46.948 --> 42:52.803
_

43:01.849 --> 43:04.722
What will we do, Bennet? Wait for
the first of those men out there

43:04.733 --> 43:07.859
to feel that their prospects
might be advanced by our shackling?

43:07.870 --> 43:09.142
We will not.

43:10.669 --> 43:12.723
Perhaps I am only good
for the fight after all.

43:12.734 --> 43:14.523
Then let us bring it, Bennet.

43:16.299 --> 43:18.699
- The brother's Dove.
- Susan Hart.

43:19.002 --> 43:23.578
That woman there, the woman Swift,
she saved me from that creature.

43:23.579 --> 43:26.664
he would have had that knife
up under my ribs in a trice,

43:26.675 --> 43:28.133
but he obeyed her command.

43:28.144 --> 43:30.850
She and her husband also,
they know this Nathaniel.

43:30.861 --> 43:35.461
If we find him, his capture
will bring us also his brother.

43:47.529 --> 43:48.865
With me.

43:59.230 --> 44:00.430
Keys.

44:01.479 --> 44:04.384
Stand down, Carter. Just go.

44:11.892 --> 44:15.923
Get out. Move!

44:18.906 --> 44:20.199
Get walking.

44:45.028 --> 44:46.234
Drake!

44:47.354 --> 44:48.558
[Inaudible]

44:48.569 --> 44:52.588
Drake, my Colt.

44:56.444 --> 44:58.206
Captain Jackson's effects.

45:02.972 --> 45:04.363
Do it, Drummond.

45:16.194 --> 45:19.456
Inspectors, will you
not even make it appear

45:19.467 --> 45:21.384
as if we tried to do our duty?

45:50.293 --> 45:51.493
Move!

45:55.929 --> 45:58.098
Do you see her, Bennet?

46:02.226 --> 46:04.024
Call me mad now, will ya?

46:06.573 --> 46:07.773
Rose,

46:09.042 --> 46:11.085
Rose, do you have my son?

46:11.650 --> 46:15.571
I don't know how you dare ask.

46:15.725 --> 46:20.434
He is at home being
watched by a real policemen.

46:21.197 --> 46:25.906
Rose, please, none of this
is as I would have wanted it.

46:25.906 --> 46:28.085
You are so dear to me.

46:28.086 --> 46:30.606
But my deception, can you...
will you understand how...

46:30.948 --> 46:32.148
Whoa!

46:32.881 --> 46:34.951
I think you said your
piece now, Mrs. Drake.

46:34.962 --> 46:38.218
I ain't even begun, Captain.

46:41.693 --> 46:47.237
Do you know what he and I have suffered?

46:48.107 --> 46:51.555
And all for the true love of you.

46:52.198 --> 46:54.772
And we have done it together.

46:55.181 --> 46:58.921
But that love is now broke and forgot.

46:59.600 --> 47:06.073
So you may run, but do not think
you will ever see your son again.

47:06.837 --> 47:12.288
You gave him to me. You died.

47:12.299 --> 47:14.915
And you remain dead.

47:15.749 --> 47:20.697
And if I see you again, Long
Susan, I will kill you myself.

47:21.662 --> 47:23.547
We must run. We must run.

47:25.232 --> 47:26.683
Is it you, Rose?

47:28.302 --> 47:30.792
You who sent Mr. Dove to that cellar?

47:34.406 --> 47:35.956
What happened to you, Rose?

47:40.761 --> 47:43.507
Drake. Drake. Now.

48:27.419 --> 48:30.586
On a hard day, you are a
fine sight, Mathilda Reid.

48:33.159 --> 48:36.515
Your eyes do not deceive
you, Mathilda. It is her.

48:36.526 --> 48:39.273
Our thanks, Miss
Castello. We must speak.

48:47.573 --> 48:49.795
There will be bad things said about me,

48:50.113 --> 48:52.528
things that perhaps you
will not recognise as acts

48:52.539 --> 48:54.115
I could have carried out.

48:55.448 --> 48:57.249
Then are they true?

48:58.480 --> 49:00.455
Some, yes.

49:03.608 --> 49:08.558
Tilda Reid, the girl born to me twice.

49:09.358 --> 49:11.779
No wonder of the woman you've become.

49:13.309 --> 49:16.520
No. Not again, Father. Do not leave me.

49:16.531 --> 49:19.608
You stay close to your
Samuel Drummond, understand?

49:19.801 --> 49:22.641
He loves you, will keep you safe.

49:23.777 --> 49:26.326
And Mathilda, this
is the most important.

49:26.827 --> 49:28.607
You must deny me.

49:28.997 --> 49:31.432
You must openly state that
any love for your father

49:31.443 --> 49:34.006
has been extinguished by
what you have learned of him.

49:34.007 --> 49:37.457
Should you need to speak with
me, place a candle in your window.

49:42.653 --> 49:44.016
Miss Castello?

49:44.373 --> 49:45.932
You will be watched.

49:45.933 --> 49:50.226
So you play the innocent for now.
Else he will see you dead, understand?

49:52.393 --> 49:53.942
Now we go hunting.

49:55.081 --> 49:57.163
You will search the length
of Whitechapel high streets

49:57.174 --> 49:58.480
and Commercial Road.

50:01.134 --> 50:02.334
Ahem.

50:04.632 --> 50:05.971
Let him through.

50:10.084 --> 50:11.681
Yes, Sergeant Drummond?

50:11.682 --> 50:14.471
Mr. Dove, sir, there
was a delivery for you.

50:14.473 --> 50:16.728
A boy brought this, sir.

50:31.553 --> 50:34.362
We put him up and sent him running.

50:34.362 --> 50:37.743
But there is no rat hole in
Whitechapel where he can hide from me.

51:06.082 --> 51:08.016
Feel this needful, do you?

51:08.027 --> 51:10.621
I do. And more besides.

51:10.622 --> 51:13.169
It was you instructed me
to keep wearies on him.

51:13.180 --> 51:15.509
But I cannot make that
my life sole calling

51:15.520 --> 51:19.274
if the watching of him must be done each
and every minute of each and every day.

51:21.372 --> 51:23.131
He can't help himself.

51:23.132 --> 51:25.328
And I do not know of any
other way of doing it.

51:25.339 --> 51:27.128
He's chained, Abel.

51:27.602 --> 51:29.581
My brother is chained.

51:29.582 --> 51:32.838
As all animals require,
chaining or slaying.

51:32.849 --> 51:34.689
- What's that you say?
- Uh...

51:35.337 --> 51:38.583
only this, that I should've
tied him up in a sack

51:38.594 --> 51:41.030
and put him in the river
when I first saw him.

51:41.832 --> 51:44.781
He is past saving, Augustus.

51:44.792 --> 51:49.734
And you and your ever-burgeoning
eminence needs protection from him.

51:49.995 --> 51:51.582
So you think to end his misery.

51:51.593 --> 51:52.935
I do.

51:53.549 --> 51:55.111
And wish for my sanction.

51:55.112 --> 51:58.817
I do not require your sanction.

51:59.257 --> 52:02.817
The pair of you would have been ground
down for bread had it not been for me.

52:03.222 --> 52:06.691
I do you the respect
of telling you is all.

52:08.952 --> 52:13.724
Augustus, what's he saying?

52:19.152 --> 52:24.200
Augustus, Augustus, please,
please, I will be better.

52:25.592 --> 52:27.884
I will be calm, I promise.

52:29.525 --> 52:32.658
Go then. But make it swift.

52:34.963 --> 52:37.011
Go on. Go on. Go on.

52:37.012 --> 52:39.216
You will be at peace, my boy.

52:46.259 --> 52:47.477
Oh.

52:57.770 --> 52:58.970
Argh!

53:00.757 --> 53:02.639
He is my blood, Abel.

53:04.613 --> 53:06.158
What else would I do?

53:27.682 --> 53:29.210
A cloak.

53:29.651 --> 53:31.937
To reveal the truth of himself.

53:34.801 --> 53:37.250
I think it is unlikely
they will return now,

53:37.251 --> 53:40.171
unless it is Augustus Dove and
20 men hoping to make our capture.

53:40.368 --> 53:42.452
Until we are apprehended,

53:42.463 --> 53:45.127
I do not think your Croker
will return that creature here.

53:45.139 --> 53:48.098
They're ours, God damn
it, stolen in good faith

53:48.109 --> 53:51.060
and worth a bundle, a bundle we four

53:51.071 --> 53:53.031
- could well benefit from.
- We four?

53:53.042 --> 53:54.964
I'm not your brother in outlaw arms.

53:54.975 --> 53:58.092
Oh, are you not? Well, why don't
you go trot back to your desk then?

54:01.969 --> 54:06.691
I believe I have some instinct as to
where your quarry may now hide itself.

54:10.057 --> 54:11.597
Where'd he say?

54:12.549 --> 54:13.818
Somewhere.

54:13.819 --> 54:16.103
It is a... it is a
whole system of tunnels.

54:31.519 --> 54:33.098
What do you want, brother?

54:33.099 --> 54:34.688
What do you want?

54:34.689 --> 54:38.340
To live, grow old, be happy.

54:38.351 --> 54:40.432
Same as me, Augustus.

54:40.443 --> 54:46.008
But I cannot because of what
I want is not what I need.

54:46.019 --> 54:49.902
The need never dies, does it, boy?

54:51.989 --> 54:56.697
Storm blows up for
a score of wherefores,

54:56.895 --> 55:00.056
but the sailing remains the same.

55:00.067 --> 55:03.638
Augustus, he ain't your mainsail.

55:03.639 --> 55:05.868
He ain't even your anger.

55:06.401 --> 55:13.377
He is the teeth of the hurricane,
he's your kraken waking.

55:14.359 --> 55:17.660
Perhaps, but he is mine.

55:25.199 --> 55:28.398
Listen, you do not
look for me, understand?

55:29.068 --> 55:31.173
Go, brother. Hide.

55:31.184 --> 55:32.489
I shall find you.

55:32.500 --> 55:34.090
Yes, Augustus.

55:40.579 --> 55:42.213
I gave you life.

55:46.939 --> 55:49.067
It is not a gift, Abel.

56:09.169 --> 56:11.922
If you weren't dead
already, I'd kill you myself.

56:20.519 --> 56:22.283
Where, man, where is your creature?

56:23.930 --> 56:26.750
Please, please, Abel, only tell us.

56:29.649 --> 56:32.952
Take parallel paths, then.
Our eyes on each other's torch.

57:26.778 --> 57:27.998
Come.

57:28.544 --> 57:30.283
Try me once more.

57:46.336 --> 57:48.457
You think me scared of you, do you?

57:50.244 --> 57:51.922
Well, I am not.

57:53.705 --> 57:55.525
I am you, man!

58:00.327 --> 58:03.060
Do you sometimes walk in sunlight

58:03.225 --> 58:04.991
- and remember what murder
- Bennet!

58:05.002 --> 58:06.726
your hands have made?

58:07.748 --> 58:10.399
Do you quiver with the same power of it?

58:10.410 --> 58:11.778
Bennet!

58:14.068 --> 58:15.542
Then come.

58:16.247 --> 58:17.450
Come.

58:18.896 --> 58:20.787
Show yourself to me.

58:22.544 --> 58:25.409
It will only be a looking
in the mirror after all.

58:26.629 --> 58:28.937
Believe yourself a cruel man, do ya?

58:29.685 --> 58:33.996
Believe this life, only hung
for that cruelty to breed.

58:35.786 --> 58:38.715
You do not know the bare start of it.

58:39.850 --> 58:42.446
How many, then? Huh?

58:43.479 --> 58:44.893
Ratovski?

58:45.139 --> 58:51.433
My boy Gower, the immigrant
Nadelman, and two guards?

58:52.127 --> 58:55.612
Let us hazard, perhaps, two
or three more along the way.

58:56.919 --> 58:58.314
Six, say it.

58:58.829 --> 59:01.934
Six is nothing, boy.

59:07.649 --> 59:11.938
I ended 20 men beneath these hands

59:11.939 --> 59:14.441
in only one half hour morning.

01:00:18.329 --> 01:00:20.515
A whole world of cruelty, man.

01:00:22.061 --> 01:00:23.792
But I shall tell you this.

01:00:24.469 --> 01:00:29.224
There ain't nothing so cruel in
this world as the killing of love.

01:00:45.519 --> 01:00:47.054
Feast on me, then.

01:00:48.815 --> 01:00:51.978
Cut me open and eat out my heart.

01:00:52.750 --> 01:00:55.737
But all you will find there is dust.

01:01:02.042 --> 01:01:04.498
Argh!

01:01:19.344 --> 01:01:20.619
Bennet!

01:01:21.070 --> 01:01:23.129
With me! With me!

01:01:34.827 --> 01:01:36.027
Bennet.

01:01:38.006 --> 01:01:39.287
