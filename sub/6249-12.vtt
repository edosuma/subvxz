- Wow. I guess there's life
on this campus after all.

00:07.374 --> 00:10.741
- Oh, what, you've been here before?
- I guest-lectured last year.

00:10.844 --> 00:12.971
- Forensic science majors.
- [Siren Blares ]

00:13.079 --> 00:16.606
- Four students showed up.Just four!
- Four? What was your topic?

00:16.716 --> 00:19.378
Dimorphic distinctions
within the human thoracic cavity.

00:19.486 --> 00:23.684
Right. And just four
whole people showed up, huh?

00:23.790 --> 00:27.055
- The dean blamed it on some game
halfway across the country.
- Come on.

00:27.160 --> 00:29.822
This is Atlantic State University,
home oftheJaguars.

00:29.929 --> 00:34.298
Other than sex and beer, nothin' is more important
to these kids than their basketball team.

00:34.401 --> 00:36.301
- What about academics?
- I'll tell you what.

00:36.403 --> 00:38.303
You bring your little "didactic"
thoracic speech here...

00:38.405 --> 00:41.636
any other time oftheyear, and you'll draw
maybe five, five and a half easy.

00:41.741 --> 00:43.641
Dimorphic, not didactic.

00:43.743 --> 00:48.271
[Man ]Student employee namedJustine Berry
opened up the practice gym.

00:48.381 --> 00:51.373
Campus police called us because they didn't
know what to make ofwhat they found.

00:51.484 --> 00:53.384
Hey, I got it.
F.B.I. Special Agent Seeley Booth.

00:53.486 --> 00:55.454
That here is, uh-
That's Dr. Brennan.

00:55.555 --> 00:57.523
ChiefJack Cutler, campus police.

00:57.624 --> 00:59.956
Justine was opening up the gym
after the four-dayweekend.

01:00.060 --> 01:02.893
- Uh, you work here, Ms. Berry?
- What the hell? You know what I mean?

01:02.996 --> 01:07.296
- Not at all.
- The second I unlocked the door, the smell just-

01:07.400 --> 01:10.198
[ Gasps ]
Right?

01:10.303 --> 01:12.897
The bleachers fold down.
You need a key to open or shut 'em.

01:13.006 --> 01:16.635
Whatever got caught back here
sure as hell ain't an animal.

01:16.743 --> 01:18.643
Oh, it.

01:18.745 --> 01:21.077
Sounds interesting.

01:21.181 --> 01:23.081
[Booth ]
Oh.

01:23.183 --> 01:25.981
Hey, uh, you know, last time
I was under the bleachers...

01:26.086 --> 01:29.522
I was, uh, gettin' ready to smoke a cigarette
and make out with Vanessa Taylor.

01:29.622 --> 01:31.681
- I didn't knowyou smoked.
- Eighth grade, Bones, huh?

01:31.791 --> 01:34.385
Come on. Didn'tyou ever get naughty
with a jock under the bleachers?

01:34.494 --> 01:36.587
I-You were a jock?

01:36.696 --> 01:40.029
You had to be one ifyou wanted
to make out with Vanessa Taylor.

01:43.870 --> 01:45.997
[ Insects Buzzing ]

01:50.310 --> 01:53.609
- What is it?
- Male. [ Sniffs ]

01:53.713 --> 01:56.273
- Yousmell that?
- You're kidding.

01:56.382 --> 01:58.111
I don't mean decomp.
Alcohol.

01:58.218 --> 02:01.278
Vagrantpasses out bythe heating grate,
andsomebody closes up the bleachers.

02:01.387 --> 02:02.820
- [Squeaking]
- Whoa!

02:04.257 --> 02:07.317
That would account for
the accelerated decomp.

02:07.427 --> 02:09.054
[ Whistles ]

02:09.162 --> 02:12.063
- And the babies.
- Babyrats?

02:12.165 --> 02:14.895
- Yeah. We'll need them.
- Okay, um-

02:15.001 --> 02:17.731
Yeah, uh, ChiefCutler,
you got a rat carrier?

02:17.837 --> 02:20.533
- Yeah, I'll find something.
- [Brennan ] We'll need the floor.

02:20.640 --> 02:23.734
- The floor?
- Whatever got pushed through that grate.

02:23.843 --> 02:27.301
- Here you go. This do?
- Yeah, that'd be great.
Put that rat in the rat motel.

02:27.413 --> 02:30.746
- We're good to go.
- We need to take the pinkies, or they'll die.

02:30.850 --> 02:33.318
Yeah, 'cause the world needs more rats.
"'82 champs"?

02:33.419 --> 02:36.855
'82 champs- Let me see that ring.

02:36.956 --> 02:42.053
Wait a minute. ChiefCutler
as inJack "Cutter'"Cutler?

02:42.162 --> 02:45.359
- Yeah. Haven't heard that one in a while.
- [ Laughs ] Bones!

02:45.465 --> 02:50.061
You're lookin'at the starpoint guard from
one ofthe best college basketball teams ever!

02:50.170 --> 02:52.229
Huh.

02:52.338 --> 02:54.329
- Drafted by the Detroit Pistons.
- Knees blew out.

02:54.440 --> 02:56.738
- Ended my career.
- Booth.

02:56.843 --> 02:59.539
Yeah? Eleven?

03:00.947 --> 03:02.505
Oh, my God, no.

03:02.615 --> 03:04.947
- What?
- Did he wear one of these?

03:05.051 --> 03:06.712
- He never took it off.
- Who?

03:06.819 --> 03:10.915
R.J. Manning. He's one of the best
college forwards in the conference.

03:11.024 --> 03:14.084
- He was destined to be the number one pick.
- I don't know what that means.

03:14.194 --> 03:17.391
But ifthis is Manning,
that's not going to happen.

03:56.436 --> 03:58.427
Eight seconds for
the bleachers to close.

03:58.538 --> 04:00.699
According to
the chief of campus police.

04:00.807 --> 04:03.241
I don't think the victim
was killed by the bleachers.

04:03.343 --> 04:05.368
[ Hodgins ]
What doyou mean? The dude's an accordion.

04:05.478 --> 04:07.469
[ Saroyan ]
What killed him ifitwasn't the bleachers closing?

04:07.580 --> 04:11.175
- The skull shows evidence ofpowdering.
- Crushing would snap the bone.

04:11.284 --> 04:14.276
Multiple strikes lead to powdering.

04:14.387 --> 04:17.788
But it is possible that the skull being forced
through the grate caused the powdering.

04:17.890 --> 04:20.120
We'll know more after
the skull's reconstructed.

04:20.226 --> 04:22.626
Man, theJaguars will not be
the same without R.J. Manning.

04:22.729 --> 04:25.994
Thirty-plus points in his last five games.
Forty-plus in the last three.

04:26.099 --> 04:28.260
[ Sighs ]
Notyou guys too?

04:28.368 --> 04:31.303
Hey, R.J. Manning was gonna be
the next Kobe Bryant.

04:31.404 --> 04:33.668
That explains why every news source
in town wants to confirm his death.

04:33.773 --> 04:38.210
The ancient Greeks chased a ball
made of animal skin wrapped around seeds.

04:38.311 --> 04:40.336
But that was a fertility rite
played in the nude.

04:40.446 --> 04:44.007
- Nude? Count me in.
- I tend to look better fully clothed.

04:44.117 --> 04:47.883
Both central and lateral
maxillary incisors are implants.

04:47.987 --> 04:49.955
That's a match.

04:52.292 --> 04:54.954
- It's Manning.
- I'll inform the press.

04:55.061 --> 04:59.657
Zack, your priority is
to classify the skull fractures.

04:59.766 --> 05:02.360
Dude- [Chuckles ]you're not goin'home for days.

05:02.468 --> 05:06.962
The victim's clothing and the chunk of floor
should keep you pretty busy too, Dr. Hodgins.

05:08.975 --> 05:13.537
Sure it's R.J., not just
somebodywearing his medallion?

05:13.646 --> 05:16.479
We matched your brother's
dental records.

05:16.582 --> 05:19.574
- That means it's definitely R.J., Kamaria.
- Areyou R.J."s lawyer?

05:19.686 --> 05:21.779
No. Well, you could
probably say that.

05:21.888 --> 05:24.516
I'm- I'm, uh,
an alumnus of Atlantic State.

05:24.624 --> 05:28.116
What I do now is I volunteer my time
to help the team with their finances...

05:28.227 --> 05:31.162
- and their scholarships, living arrangements-
- Did you all live together?

05:31.264 --> 05:33.562
No, R.J. Iived on campus...

05:33.666 --> 05:35.998
but he still takes care
of me and my little sister.

05:36.102 --> 05:38.764
Their parents passed away
twoyears ago.

05:38.871 --> 05:42.272
We livedon R.J. 's scholarship,
and Mr. Francis got me a goodjob downtown.

05:42.375 --> 05:44.866
Yeah. R.J. mention
any trouble in his life lately?

05:44.977 --> 05:47.673
- Anyarguments?
- Only-

05:47.780 --> 05:49.680
No, it's okay.
It's okay.

05:49.782 --> 05:51.841
He had a fight with Mr. Francis.

05:51.951 --> 05:54.078
- Why'd R.J. strike you?
- I don't know.

05:54.187 --> 05:57.623
He was an exhausted 20-year-old man,
and I was treating him like a kid.

05:57.724 --> 06:02.957
R.J. Ioved Mr. Francis. We all do.
You can ask R.J."s girlfriend.

06:03.062 --> 06:05.758
That's Dallas Verona.
She's a cheerleader.

06:05.865 --> 06:07.799
Also, you know,
you should talk to Coach Morse.

06:07.900 --> 06:10.391
Those were the two people
closest to him other than his family.

06:12.739 --> 06:15.503
Damn it. I should've
gotten a bigger turkey.

06:15.608 --> 06:17.508
You have a smaller skull?

06:17.610 --> 06:19.510
Do I have a smaller skull than who?

06:19.612 --> 06:22.342
I meant, is there a smaller skull
we can wrap in this turkey carcass?

06:26.051 --> 06:29.714
- Boys, this better be good.
- It's going to take me a very
long time to reconstruct...

06:29.821 --> 06:34.281
R.J. Manning's skull in order to discover
whether he died from multiple blows.

06:34.392 --> 06:36.656
- Which suggests murder.
- Orifhis skull was...

06:36.761 --> 06:39.594
crushed through the heating grate
just like this one.

06:39.698 --> 06:42.258
We covered a skull with turkey meat.

06:42.367 --> 06:45.632
I calibrated the pounds per square inch
from the closing bleachers.

06:45.737 --> 06:48.968
And we filled the skull cavity
with a gelatinous matrix.

06:49.074 --> 06:51.599
Okay. Turn it on.

06:55.947 --> 06:57.847
[ Whirring ]

07:03.221 --> 07:06.122
[WhirringStops ]

07:07.892 --> 07:11.953
By "gelatinous matrix, '"
you meant ambrosia salad?

07:12.063 --> 07:14.031
Gelatinous matrix sounded better.

07:16.735 --> 07:20.136
There's absolutely no sign
ofpowdering here.

07:20.238 --> 07:23.833
Then R.J. Manning was killed
by multiple strikes to the head.

07:33.118 --> 07:36.315
- I'm tellin' ya, George Francis
does not care about that family.
- Kamaria seemed to like him.

07:36.421 --> 07:38.889
Sure. I mean, he paid the rent
and made her brother a star.

07:38.990 --> 07:40.958
But, you know, he's got
a whole 'nother agenda.

07:41.059 --> 07:43.493
- How doyou know?
- 'Cause I was a college athlete.

07:43.595 --> 07:46.792
- Guys like that, they're
always buzzin' around campus.
- Why?

07:46.898 --> 07:48.991
Why? 'Cause there's millions
of dollars at stake.

07:49.100 --> 07:51.227
- For bouncing a ball?
- Well, yeah!

07:51.336 --> 07:54.931
All that bouncing, you know,
translates into dollars from TV rights...

07:55.039 --> 07:57.371
revenue shares, tournament fees.

07:57.475 --> 08:00.706
Well, I don't understand
what's interesting about it.

08:00.812 --> 08:05.545
Unlikeyou, most people enjoy a pastime
that takes them out oftheir head.

08:05.650 --> 08:08.710
Takes them out oftheir head
like drugs and alcohol.

08:08.820 --> 08:10.879
- [Cell Phone Rings ]
- [ Clears Throat ]

08:10.989 --> 08:12.957
- [ Beeps ]
- Brennan.

08:15.794 --> 08:19.753
- Hodgins and Zack proved that R.J. was murdered.
- Murdered.

08:19.864 --> 08:23.425
We've suffered a loss, gentlemen.
One of our brothers is gone.

08:23.535 --> 08:25.901
As a team, we grieve forhim.

08:26.004 --> 08:28.996
I tellyou whatyou
do not weep forthough.

08:29.107 --> 08:32.167
Losin' the best damn power forward
in this entire country.

08:32.277 --> 08:35.837
Colby Page is not shedding tears
because we lost a powerforward, is he?

08:35.947 --> 08:37.914
- No, sir.
- How do I know that?

08:38.015 --> 08:40.883
'Cause Colby Page is gonna step right up
and take R.J. 's position.

08:40.985 --> 08:43.351
This is his opportunity,
and it's good that he sees it as such.

Col by.

08:48.091 --> 08:50.252
Father God...

08:50.360 --> 08:54.558
accept our brother R.J. Manni ng
i nto your loving arms.

08:54.664 --> 08:57.394
Give us the faith
and the strength to carry on.

08:59.169 --> 09:01.797
- Amen.
- [Players ]Amen.

09:01.905 --> 09:03.736
Now, you boys go be together.
Talk about R.J.

09:03.840 --> 09:07.037
Come right back here and be ready
to carry on and do what needs doin'.

09:07.143 --> 09:09.111
- [ All ] Yes, Coach.
- All right, let's go!

09:09.212 --> 09:11.544
- All right, Colby.
- Let's do this.

09:11.648 --> 09:14.412
- [Morse ] Go. Move it, Harris!
- [ Harris ] Yes, sir.

09:14.517 --> 09:16.485
That's very impressive, Coach.

09:16.586 --> 09:18.554
- You the F.B.I.?
- Yes, sir.

09:18.655 --> 09:21.715
Listen, ifyou're gonna talk to the boys,
I'd preferyou do it soon.

09:21.825 --> 09:24.487
Let us move on
from the tragedy, okay?

09:31.101 --> 09:33.001
What now?

09:33.103 --> 09:38.632
Well, find out which one ofthese
pretty girls over here is R.J."s girlfriend.

09:39.876 --> 09:41.776
[Door Closes ]

09:43.146 --> 09:45.376
I went home for the long weekend.

09:45.482 --> 09:48.178
- R.J. stayed on campus.
- Why?

09:48.285 --> 09:50.685
Whatever- team stuff.

09:50.787 --> 09:53.688
Did you call R.J., talk to him?

09:53.790 --> 09:57.453
Yeah, and texted him.
But he didn't answer.

09:57.560 --> 10:01.587
That's not weird or anything.
R.J."s the face-to-face kind, right?

10:01.698 --> 10:05.134
Everything okay between you?

10:05.235 --> 10:08.033
- Were you sexually active?
- He was my boyfriend.

10:08.138 --> 10:11.266
He was in great shape,
so, pretty active, yeah.

10:11.374 --> 10:14.434
Were there any noticeable
changes in your sex life?

10:14.544 --> 10:16.444
Frequency, duration?

10:16.546 --> 10:19.709
[ Scoffs ]
Every day but game day.

10:19.816 --> 10:21.784
That was R.J."s motto.

10:21.885 --> 10:25.286
Nojealous boyfrriend from
the past, angry dad, nothin'?

10:25.388 --> 10:27.219
Oh, my God.

10:27.324 --> 10:29.690
Mr. Francis is right.

10:30.727 --> 10:32.695
You people think R.J. was murdered.

10:32.796 --> 10:36.129
Was he under any kind of stress?

10:36.232 --> 10:38.325
Of course.

10:38.435 --> 10:41.495
- Midterm exams?
- [ Scoffs ]

10:41.604 --> 10:46.507
R.J. was a star. They made sure
he could pass his midterms.

10:46.609 --> 10:49.373
R.J. was stressed
because he always wanted to win.

10:49.479 --> 10:51.572
Stressed enough to hit Mr. Francis?

10:51.681 --> 10:56.209
R.J. never told me why he did that,
but he felt bad about it.

11:03.126 --> 11:05.390
Couldn't find enough tissue
for a tox screen...

11:05.495 --> 11:08.760
because these little scamps
ate what was left.

11:08.865 --> 11:10.765
Yeah, uh-

11:10.867 --> 11:12.767
[Whirring]

11:12.869 --> 11:16.896
Hodgins, is that my own
personal blender from the kitchen?

11:17.006 --> 11:19.873
Toss these babies into
the gas chromatograph.

11:21.378 --> 11:24.108
- [ Whirring Stops ]
- Did you get it from the kitchen?

11:24.214 --> 11:28.844
Yes. Any foreign substances in R.J."s body
should show up in the maggot juice.

11:28.952 --> 11:32.786
Is it labeled "personal property
ofC.S."' on the bottom?

11:36.493 --> 11:38.927
Yes.

11:41.131 --> 11:44.396
Don't worry.
I'll rinse it out.

11:47.303 --> 11:49.498
[Booth ]
I can giveyou a fewpointers, Bones.

11:49.606 --> 11:51.801
Colby doesn't get out ofclass
for a few minutes.

11:51.908 --> 11:54.308
You gotta sort of flip your wrists,
you see?

11:54.411 --> 11:57.778
- Like this. Bang!
- Sports should not have such
a priority in the university.

11:57.881 --> 12:00.611
All right. You know what?
That's crazy.

12:00.717 --> 12:03.447

36:57.736 --> 37:00.534
Twenty-five.

37:00.639 --> 37:02.698
Twenty-five pounds.

37:03.976 --> 37:07.104
An imprint from free weights.

37:09.214 --> 37:13.617
Our unknown female either meets
or lures R.J. under the bleachers.

37:13.719 --> 37:16.313
- Lures?
- We're pretty sure the gi rl
didn't actually kill R.J....

37:16.421 --> 37:18.946
but that doesn't mean
that she wasn't bait.

37:19.057 --> 37:22.288
I got somethin'- blood spatter.

37:22.394 --> 37:24.726
Uh, it was wiped, but it's definite.

37:24.830 --> 37:27.424
Looks like we have
our murderweapon.

37:29.868 --> 37:33.031
D.N.A. evidence is in.
The blood on the weight is definitely R.J."s.

37:33.138 --> 37:35.629
What about the saliva
and the sputum?

37:35.741 --> 37:37.709
- The loogie.
- I know about loogies.

37:37.809 --> 37:39.777
Two things about the saliva.

37:39.878 --> 37:42.870
One is that it did not come from
the same person who provided the loogie.

37:42.981 --> 37:46.473
So the person who serviced R.J.
is not the same person who spat on him.

37:46.585 --> 37:51.420
Two, we got a partial match
on the saliva from one ofthe cheerleaders.

37:51.523 --> 37:54.185
[Booth ]
Celeste Cutler.

37:54.293 --> 37:56.818
You think Colby and I
plotted to kill R.J. Manning?

37:56.928 --> 38:02.195
Celeste,you lured R.J. Manning
underthe bleachers, andyou kept him busy.

38:02.301 --> 38:06.362
- Kept him busy how?
- Evidence shows she was
performing oral sex on him.

38:06.471 --> 38:08.996
Which gave you time
to bash his head in.

38:09.107 --> 38:11.598
- Butyou made one mistake.
- One.

38:11.710 --> 38:13.678
Look, I haven't done anything.

38:13.779 --> 38:17.374
We will match this D.N.A.
to the sputum found at the scene.

38:17.482 --> 38:20.042
- What?
- You hawked a loogie on him, kid.

38:20.152 --> 38:23.349
- You killed him and you spat on his face.
- Look, God is mywitness.

38:23.455 --> 38:25.650
That never happened.

38:25.757 --> 38:27.190
[Knocking]

38:27.292 --> 38:30.056
Sorry to interrupt,
butyou really need to see this.

38:33.832 --> 38:37.131
- [Brennan ] Toxscreen profile?
- [Saroyan ]All 13 S. T.R. 's.

38:37.235 --> 38:38.634
Thanks.

38:40.205 --> 38:46.041
We got a hit on code "S" from the D.N.A.
on the, uh, hawked loogie.

39:03.462 --> 39:05.430
[ Booth ]
Hey, Chief.

39:05.530 --> 39:08.931
If I hadn't have spat on that son of a bitch,
you neverwould've caught me, right?

39:09.034 --> 39:12.026
- Well, Celeste might've told us.
- She doesn't know.

39:13.568 --> 39:16.332
I came in and...

39:17.438 --> 39:19.702
saw my little girl-

39:19.807 --> 39:21.832
sawherwith R.J.-

39:22.944 --> 39:25.412

doin' what she was doin'.

39:25.513 --> 39:28.175
She heardme and took off.

39:28.282 --> 39:31.547
None ofthe girls could resist R.J.

39:32.854 --> 39:34.822
Kid had it all.

39:35.857 --> 39:38.553
Magic boy.

39:39.694 --> 39:43.027
You know what else he had?
The clap.

39:43.130 --> 39:47.999
And he knew that when he took
my daughter underneath the- [ Sobbing ]

39:50.204 --> 39:52.468
Oh. He's got a gun, Bones.

39:52.573 --> 39:54.734
I need you to leave now.

39:54.842 --> 39:58.369
Don't worry.
It's not you I intend to shoot.

40:01.215 --> 40:04.616
- [ Sighs ]
- There's no way "Cutter'"Cutlerkills himself.

40:04.719 --> 40:06.584
No way "Cutter" Cutler
goes down without a fight.

40:06.687 --> 40:10.248
- What are you doing?
You want him to shoot at you?
- [ Quietly ] Go.

40:14.695 --> 40:17.721
[Footsteps Departing]

40:17.832 --> 40:21.063
[ Sniffling ]
I was just like him, you know?

40:21.168 --> 40:25.229
- [DoorOpens, Closes ]
- Under these same bleachers, in fact.

40:25.339 --> 40:27.773
I was as badas him.

40:28.910 --> 40:31.276
You wouldn't understand.

40:31.379 --> 40:34.177
We were all like that.

40:34.282 --> 40:37.774
It changes your life.
You-You seeyour little girl.

40:40.187 --> 40:42.485
It's a different perspective.

40:42.590 --> 40:47.527
People are gonna understand
the action thatyou took, okay? I do.

40:47.628 --> 40:50.256
Hey, man,you're "Cutter'"Cutler.

Lowest assist in turnover ratios.

40:53.901 --> 40:56.665
Huh? Twelve triple-doubles
in your last season.

40:56.771 --> 40:59.467
Nobody could change direction
in the open court likeyou, man.

40:59.574 --> 41:01.041
- [ Cocking ]
- Nobody.

41:01.142 --> 41:03.042
No.

41:04.078 --> 41:07.536
Do it now.
Just change direction again.

41:17.391 --> 41:21.885
"Cutter" Cutler died a long time ago.

41:23.631 --> 41:25.724

- Why areyou telling me this?

'Causeyou said we're

Okay, okay.
You leave the tip.

Even Cutler knew you were lying...

42:50.217 --> 42:52.549
when you said you treated women like that
under the bleachers.

42:52.653 --> 42:54.814

- Yes.
