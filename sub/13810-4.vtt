03:05.894 --> 03:08.688
THIS WHOLE BEACH IS GOING
TO BE FILLED WITH TOURISTS.

03:08.771 --> 03:10.940
BUT ON THE BRIGHT SIDE,
SUMMER MEANS NO SCHOOL

03:11.024 --> 03:13.234
PLUS A LOT OF CLAMS
FOR THE SHORE SHACK.

03:13.318 --> 03:17.530

A BIG BOSS SOUTH SWELL

TOMORROW, TOO.

03:24.454 --> 03:26.998
I HAD A BOIL ON MY LEFT SHOULDER

THE WEATHER CHANNEL.

START OUT THE SUMMER
BY GETTING BUSTED.

as Ocean Shores' beaches were
closed to swimmers today.

NOW THE BEACH IS
CLOSED TO EVERYONE.

COULD BE RESPONSIBLE?

TO THESE WATERS.

HIT MADTOWN.

NO PUSHING, YOU GUYS.

09:06.212 --> 09:09.048

09:09.131 --> 09:11.050
NOW KEEP IT MOVING.

DON'T SKATE
ON THE SMALL CHILDREN.

I KNEW THIS WHOLE SHARK THING
WOULD COME BACK TO BITE US.

SO WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

09:29.277 --> 09:32.863
WELL, I THINK WE GOT
TO TELL THE TRUTH.

09:32.947 --> 09:33.823
THEN EVERYTHING WILL BE NORMAL.

09:33.906 --> 09:35.157
{\an1}THE TRUTH?

09:35.241 --> 09:38.536
WHAT KIND OF FREAKY IDEA
IS THAT?

09:38.619 --> 09:40.746
{\an1}THEY'LL THROW US
IN SHARK JAIL.

09:40.830 --> 09:44.125
THERE'S NO SUCH THING...
IS THERE?

09:44.208 --> 09:47.670
WELL, I KNOW ONE PERSON
WE GOT TO TELL.

09:47.753 --> 09:49.338
{\an1}YOU WHAT?!

09:49.422 --> 09:52.133
IT WAS A JOKE, LIKE HA-HA.

09:52.216 --> 09:53.718
NOT LIKE HA-HA.

09:53.801 --> 09:54.218
NOT HO-HO, EITHER.

09:54.302 --> 09:56.887
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU.

09:56.971 --> 09:59.432
WHAT YOU DID WAS WRONG,
NOT TO MENTION DANGEROUS.

09:59.515 --> 10:00.683
YEAH, IT WAS DUMB.

10:00.766 --> 10:03.144
HMM?

10:03.227 --> 10:05.021
OKAY, IT WAS REALLY DUMB.

10:05.104 --> 10:07.106
SORRY, DAD.

10:07.189 --> 10:08.691
Twister:
SORRY, RAYMUNDO.

10:08.774 --> 10:11.152
THERE'S NOT REALLY
A SHARK JAIL, IS THERE?

10:11.235 --> 10:13.654
OKAY, WHAT'S DONE IS DONE.

10:13.738 --> 10:17.533
FIRST THINGS FIRST: FIND A WAY
TO FIX THE DAMAGE

11:06.165 --> 11:11.504
IT SEEMS OUR SHARK PROBLEM
WAS JUST A CHILDISH PRANK.
