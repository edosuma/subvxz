00:27.152 --> 00:28.153
<i>Interesting.</i>

00:34.660 --> 00:36.954
I'd have to say the chin.

00:36.954 --> 00:38.413
You could live without a chin?

00:38.413 --> 00:39.665
Easily.

00:39.665 --> 00:42.918
But what would stop your teeth
from falling out the bottom of your face?

00:42.918 --> 00:44.086
<i>Trust me. I'd cope.</i>

00:44.086 --> 00:46.630
<i>Anyway, it'd be a much better life
than you with your "no knees."</i>

00:46.630 --> 00:48.924
Just two stiff legs. Ridiculous.

00:49.424 --> 00:51.593
For instance,
how would you drive a forklift?

00:52.761 --> 00:54.012
That wouldn't concern me.

00:54.012 --> 00:56.056
Break-dance. You couldn't break-dance.

00:56.640 --> 00:59.768
Again, that is just not something
that would affect my life.

01:00.602 --> 01:04.022
I could easily live without knees.
Especially my knees. I hate 'em.

01:04.522 --> 01:05.899
There's nothing wrong with your knees.

01:05.899 --> 01:07.651
<i>What do you mea--? They're massive.</i>

01:07.651 --> 01:09.027
When I wear leggings,

01:09.027 --> 01:11.071
it looks like I'm smuggling
a couple of cauliflowers.

01:11.071 --> 01:13.949
Interesting.
See, I'd lean more towards satsumas.

01:13.949 --> 01:14.992
<i>Thanks.</i>

01:15.993 --> 01:16.994
<i>Veggie.</i>

01:16.994 --> 01:18.787
Do I want anything from the airport?

01:18.787 --> 01:21.957
- <i>A giant Toblerone. Obviously.</i>
- Obviously.

01:21.957 --> 01:23.876
Looking forward to Veg coming home.

01:23.876 --> 01:25.460
- Might cook him dinner.
- <i>What, you?</i>

01:25.460 --> 01:28.005
<i>Yes. Thank you, Daniel. I can cook.</i>

01:29.089 --> 01:31.466
Anyway, tonight's the big night.

01:31.466 --> 01:32.718
What time's Amy arriving?

01:32.718 --> 01:34.052
Just after 9:00.

01:34.052 --> 01:35.888
After she's finished with her last client.

01:35.888 --> 01:37.097
<i>Yeah. What's she do again?</i>

01:37.097 --> 01:39.266
- Personal trainer.
- <i>Personal trainer.</i>

01:39.266 --> 01:41.393
I went out with one of them.
Do you know what?

01:41.393 --> 01:43.437
He used to stop foreplay
to put his fitness watch on.

01:43.437 --> 01:45.105
It was a bit of a mood killer,
if I'm honest.

01:45.105 --> 01:46.398
Really? That reminds me.

01:46.398 --> 01:48.233
What's the password
for the dating site again?

01:48.233 --> 01:50.152
I just wanna check my DMs
to make sure I'm not

01:50.152 --> 01:51.361
repeating myself with stories.

01:51.361 --> 01:52.779
<i>Yeah. Potato123.</i>

01:52.779 --> 01:54.406
Potato-- Potato123?

01:54.406 --> 01:55.574
<i>Yeah. Potato123.</i>

01:55.574 --> 01:58.785
- Potato123. Potato123. Potato123.
- So, how did you

01:59.786 --> 02:01.747
tell her about the whole
not-being-able-to-go-out thing?

02:02.915 --> 02:04.833
Yeah. You'll like this.

02:05.501 --> 02:06.335
I didn't.

02:06.335 --> 02:08.086
Danny, just tell her. She'll understand.

02:08.086 --> 02:09.253
It's a first date.

02:09.253 --> 02:11.590
I'll tell her
when things get more serious.

02:11.590 --> 02:13.258
Like when we're in a care home together.

02:13.967 --> 02:16.303
All right. Fine.
So what are you gonna cook?

02:18.680 --> 02:20.891
- Where do you want it, Daniel?
- On the counter. Cheers, Adam.

02:20.891 --> 02:22.017
<i>Is Adam cooking?</i>

02:22.017 --> 02:23.685
No, he just picked up a few things.

02:24.228 --> 02:25.312
Take me with you.

02:28.690 --> 02:30.651
- <i>Hi, Adam.</i>
- Hi, Leese.

02:30.651 --> 02:31.818
How's the firefighting?

02:31.818 --> 02:35.614
Yeah, good. Well, not good.
No fire is good.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.157
It's our main rule.

02:39.117 --> 02:40.869
Okay. So, let me talk you through these.

02:40.869 --> 02:43.497
I went foraging this morning,
so it's as fresh as can be.

02:43.497 --> 02:45.541
- <i>Danny, did he just say foraging?</i>
- I think so, yeah.

02:45.541 --> 02:48.460
So in here, you've got your nettles.
This is the best time of year for them.

02:48.460 --> 02:50.546
I'm surprised there's ever a good time
to eat nettles.

02:50.546 --> 02:53.298
Then you've got your wild garlic
and your chestnuts.

02:53.298 --> 02:54.383
Any questions?

02:54.383 --> 02:56.844
- I don't know where to begin.
- Okay, so, for me,

02:56.844 --> 02:59.263
I like to fry it all up with oil
and then have it with some wild rice.

02:59.263 --> 03:00.722
Have you got any wild rice?

03:00.722 --> 03:02.599
- Do I have any wild rice?
- No. You don't have wild rice.

03:02.599 --> 03:05.853
Don't worry. I got you.
I'll be back in a sec. Don't go anywhere.

03:06.478 --> 03:08.146
Danny, don't you think Adam
does enough for you?

03:08.146 --> 03:10.816
He does your washing, shopping and now
you've got him in the woods foraging.

03:10.816 --> 03:13.151
He likes to lend a helping hand.
I'm not gonna stop him.

03:13.151 --> 03:14.778
<i>I think you're taking advantage.</i>

03:14.778 --> 03:16.697
Here we go. Wild rice.

03:16.697 --> 03:18.657
Brilliant. Thank you.
Right, Adam. Listen up.

03:18.657 --> 03:19.908
We were just talking.

03:19.908 --> 03:22.160
If you had to live without a body part,
what would it be?

03:27.165 --> 03:28.125
Adam?

03:29.501 --> 03:30.502
<i>Adam?</i>

03:30.502 --> 03:31.545
Adam?

03:31.545 --> 03:32.838
- <i>Adam?</i>
- Adam?

03:32.838 --> 03:34.256
I don't know what I could,

03:34.965 --> 03:36.675
but I definitely couldn't live
without my nose.

03:36.675 --> 03:38.218
- Why not?
- I'd just miss it.

03:39.178 --> 03:40.512
Did I ever tell you about that time

03:40.512 --> 03:42.598
my uncle Brian worked in construction
in the '90s?

03:43.223 --> 03:45.601
<i>So there he was
with his mate Trevor, working away</i>

03:45.601 --> 03:48.770
<i>when this six-foot sheet of metal
above them comes loose,</i>

03:48.770 --> 03:51.190
<i>falls down, misses my uncle, but whoosh--</i>

03:51.773 --> 03:52.608
<i>Catches his mate Trevor.</i>

03:52.608 --> 03:54.234
<i>Slices the end of his nose off.</i>

03:54.234 --> 03:56.862
<i>Somehow my uncle found the tip.</i>

03:56.862 --> 03:58.488
<i>And without a moment's thought</i>...

03:58.488 --> 04:00.365
- No! Don't eat it!
- ...<i>he popped it in his mouth.</i>

04:00.365 --> 04:02.367
He put it in his mouth?

04:02.367 --> 04:04.161
- You would, wouldn't you?
- No, you wouldn't.

04:04.161 --> 04:05.662
- No. Why would you do that?
- No. You wouldn't.

04:05.662 --> 04:07.372
The mouth is the best place
to keep it fresh.

04:07.372 --> 04:09.291
No. I'm sorry. That just can't be true.

04:09.291 --> 04:12.044
So wait.
Your uncle sucked on his mate's nose?

04:12.044 --> 04:15.339
That's just not hygienic.
So what happened?

04:15.339 --> 04:17.173
They took Trevor and the tip
to the surgeon

04:17.173 --> 04:18.341
and got it stitched back on.

04:18.341 --> 04:20.219
<i>Now my uncle's godfather
to Trev's daughter.</i>

04:20.219 --> 04:23.138
<i>And as for his nose,
from some angles, you would never know.</i>

04:23.138 --> 04:26.266
<i>But from others, it did look a bit
like a badly-split sausage.</i>

04:26.767 --> 04:28.310
Right. I'd better shoot.

04:28.310 --> 04:31.480
Gotta pop upstairs
and help Mr. Shamim into his bath.

04:31.480 --> 04:33.565
Any problems,
I'm just across the hall, all right?

04:33.565 --> 04:35.442
- Cheers, Adam. Appreciate it.
- Bye, Leese!

04:35.442 --> 04:36.902
<i>Bye.</i>

04:36.902 --> 04:40.572
That guy's just too nice for his own good.
I can't believe he's still single.

04:40.572 --> 04:42.282
You never say that about me.

04:42.282 --> 04:43.825
But, Danny, I find it hard to comprehend

04:43.825 --> 04:45.911
- that anyone ever went out with you.
- Yeah. Fair.

04:45.911 --> 04:47.037
I am joking.

04:47.037 --> 04:49.206
<i>She better be good enough for you,
this Amy.</i>

04:49.206 --> 04:50.874
And she better not tease you
about how weird you are.

04:50.874 --> 04:52.209
What, like you just did there?

04:52.209 --> 04:54.753
Yeah.
But that's different. 'Cause I'm allowed.

04:54.753 --> 04:57.464
<i>Yeah. All right.
I'm a bit terrified, if I'm honest.</i>

04:57.464 --> 04:58.882
The whole talking,

04:58.882 --> 05:00.884
texting to her from
a distance of at least,

05:00.884 --> 05:03.011
14 square miles, that's terrifying enough.

05:03.011 --> 05:06.890
But to have her here in the flat,
yards away from my underwear drawer.

05:06.890 --> 05:09.101
<i>Expecting me to talk,
say interesting things.</i>

05:09.101 --> 05:11.562
It's horrifying. I don't know
how people do this, you know?

05:11.562 --> 05:13.021
I don't have any stories to tell as well.

05:13.021 --> 05:15.440
Because I've been inside all the time.
So I have no anecdotes.

05:15.440 --> 05:17.943
I know I've put too much aftershave on
'cause it's starting to redden,

05:17.943 --> 05:19.903
and it's starting to burn the nostrils.

05:19.903 --> 05:23.031
Serious now, what are the chances
that Amy's gonna be up for some nettles?

05:23.031 --> 05:25.284
What, you mean nettles
that a dog has almost certainly pissed on?

05:25.284 --> 05:27.119
<i>This is gonna be the worst date
in history.</i>

05:27.119 --> 05:28.871
<i>No, it's not. It's gonna be great.</i>

05:29.496 --> 05:32.082
Plus, I have already been on
the worst date in history.

05:32.082 --> 05:34.751
Tell me about it. 'Cause if it's good,
I'm gonna package it as my own story.

05:35.961 --> 05:37.129
He chose the place.

05:37.129 --> 05:39.506
<i>We had a couple of beers.
We had some good chat.</i>

05:39.506 --> 05:42.009
<i>And then he suggested
we move to a different setting. I said...</i>

05:42.009 --> 05:42.926
Yeah. Sure.

05:42.926 --> 05:46.096
<i>And that's when I realized
our table wasn't just a table.</i>

05:46.096 --> 05:47.306
What's going on?

05:47.806 --> 05:49.474
<i>It was also a bike.</i>

05:50.142 --> 05:52.144
<i>Seven miles he made me cycle.</i>

05:52.144 --> 05:53.562
<i>And for a week after</i>

05:53.562 --> 05:56.190
<i>I walked around like a cowboy
lost in a car park.</i>

05:57.941 --> 06:00.444
Yeah. No, that's pretty bad.

06:00.444 --> 06:02.696
Listen.
I've been worrying about this all week.

06:03.488 --> 06:04.698
<i>I've come up with a few ideas</i>

06:04.698 --> 06:06.909
that might help her feel more at ease.

06:06.909 --> 06:08.619
Course you have.
Go on then. Let's hear 'em.

06:08.619 --> 06:09.578
<i>Okay. First one.</i>

06:09.578 --> 06:11.538
Do I remove all doors on my cupboards

06:11.538 --> 06:13.290
so that she knows
I'm not concealing any weapons

06:13.290 --> 06:14.416
or recording devices?

06:14.416 --> 06:15.959
- No.
- <i>Okay. What about this one?</i>

06:15.959 --> 06:18.504
Should I put on two pairs of trousers?

06:19.546 --> 06:20.547
You know what?

06:20.547 --> 06:22.382
Why don't you just put a padlock
on your flies?

06:22.382 --> 06:23.926
I think that'll really put her at ease.

06:25.052 --> 06:26.470
'Cause it-- What do you mean? Really?

06:26.470 --> 06:28.055
No! A man with no cupboard doors

06:28.055 --> 06:30.224
and wearing two pairs of trousers
would terrify me.

06:30.224 --> 06:31.725
You know what you're trying to do?

06:31.725 --> 06:33.227
- What?
- <i>You're trying to sabotage yourself.</i>

06:33.227 --> 06:34.144
I know what you're like.

06:34.144 --> 06:35.521
You've got this self-destructive thing

06:35.521 --> 06:37.940
where you think you should be unhappy
and live alone for the rest of your life.

06:37.940 --> 06:39.358
That does not sound like me.

06:39.358 --> 06:41.068
I am a one-man roller coaster
of happiness.

06:41.068 --> 06:44.404
One-man roller coaster of happiness,
for one night only then,

06:44.404 --> 06:46.114
why don't you try and enjoy yourself?

06:46.114 --> 06:48.909
I hate trying to enjoy myself.
It hurts my tummy.

06:50.494 --> 06:52.496
- <i>That's her.</i>
- Yep. I know it's her. I can hear.

06:52.496 --> 06:54.289
- <i>Okay.</i>
- Just relax.

06:54.289 --> 06:56.625
- And-- That's too much.
- <i>Okay.</i>

06:56.625 --> 06:58.252
<i>No, leave them. They were nice.</i>

06:58.919 --> 07:01.380
I'm okay. Sh--

07:01.380 --> 07:02.297
- <i>Calm down.</i>
- I am calm.

07:02.297 --> 07:04.132
Don't say "calm down"
'cause then I won't be calm.

07:04.132 --> 07:05.050
Don't panic.

07:05.676 --> 07:06.927
<i>You're good. You've got this.</i>

07:11.265 --> 07:12.558
- Hey.
- <i>Hi.</i>

07:12.558 --> 07:13.725
Don't do that voice.

07:13.725 --> 07:14.935
I know. Shut up.

07:14.935 --> 07:17.187
Hang on. Yeah.

07:18.981 --> 07:20.691
- Two seconds.
- <i>Okay.</i>

07:20.691 --> 07:21.775
<i>Better.</i>

07:24.194 --> 07:25.112
It's her. She's here now.

07:25.112 --> 07:27.447
- So, I'm going to-- Yeah.
- <i>Yeah, she's here.</i>

07:27.447 --> 07:28.740
- I'll keep you informed.
- <i>Okay.</i>

07:28.740 --> 07:29.783
<i>You're good. You've got this.</i>

07:29.783 --> 07:31.910
Just be normal, okay?

07:32.661 --> 07:33.495
Don't say that.

07:47.176 --> 07:49.094
<i>Excuse me, sir. Sir?</i>

07:55.100 --> 07:56.101
Do it.

07:56.727 --> 07:57.561
Amy.

07:57.561 --> 07:58.562
Danny.

07:58.562 --> 07:59.646
- Hi.
- Hey.

08:00.272 --> 08:02.482
- Sorry. Is it a kind of--
- Hands.

08:03.567 --> 08:04.693
Double. Isn't that better?

08:04.693 --> 08:05.861
Who's she?

08:05.861 --> 08:07.237
I thought I knew all your friends.

08:07.237 --> 08:09.531
Please, come in. Quickly. Sorry.
Just ignore him.

08:09.531 --> 08:11.742
I know it's tough,
but trust me, it's for the best.

08:14.494 --> 08:15.454
Or would you prefer that open?

08:16.788 --> 08:17.789
Why would I prefer that?

08:17.789 --> 08:19.499
I don't know. If you wanted to--

08:20.334 --> 08:21.919
In case you felt-- If you--

08:21.919 --> 08:22.836
If what?

08:22.836 --> 08:25.380
If you're in fear of your life.
Speaking of which--

08:28.634 --> 08:29.635
Adam.

08:29.635 --> 08:31.637
- Yep?
- This is Adam.

08:31.637 --> 08:33.096
- He's a firefighter.
- Hi.

08:33.096 --> 08:34.222
Very tall, very muscular.

08:34.222 --> 08:35.682
He can overpower me in an instant,

08:35.682 --> 08:37.142
so that's the place to run

08:37.142 --> 08:38.769
- if you-- any whiff of trouble, okay?
- Danny?

08:38.769 --> 08:40.395
- Yeah?
- What are you doing?

08:40.395 --> 08:42.231
Just trying to make you feel at ease.

08:42.231 --> 08:46.193
Danny. Calm down.
Get me a drink, for God's sake.

08:46.193 --> 08:48.320
Is it-- All right.

08:49.696 --> 08:51.240
Trust me, if you did try anything dodgy,

08:51.240 --> 08:53.116
I could kick your arse in an instant.

08:53.825 --> 08:56.119
Okay. Excellent.
Good to-- Yeah. Good to know.

08:56.119 --> 08:58.038
So do you just want me to wait here or--

09:02.000 --> 09:06.088
<i>...ma'am I stabbed him in the neck.
Like you said. I told you that.</i>

09:06.088 --> 09:09.967
<i>But what you didn't tell us
is that you also strangled him earlier.</i>

09:09.967 --> 09:11.969
<i>You actually killed him twice.</i>

09:12.803 --> 09:13.804
<i>Now, ma'am...</i>

09:23.063 --> 09:24.648
- Cover me.
- Okay.

09:25.148 --> 09:26.650
Hey, Leese. Everything okay?

09:26.650 --> 09:29.236
Hey. Yeah. Just checking you landed okay.

09:29.236 --> 09:31.280
- We haven't even taken off.
- <i>What?</i>

09:31.280 --> 09:32.656
No. Flight got delayed.

09:32.656 --> 09:34.658
Yeah, pilot's lost his hat or something.
I don't know.

09:35.826 --> 09:37.077
- <i>3:00!</i>
- What?

09:37.744 --> 09:38.954
Get him right in the face!

09:39.663 --> 09:40.497
What are you doing?

09:40.497 --> 09:42.749
Sorry. Me and Rob
are playing <i>Dead Zone Seven</i>.

09:42.749 --> 09:44.334
Just to kill the time.

09:44.334 --> 09:46.670
- And zombies.
- Yes, and zombies, to be fair.

09:46.670 --> 09:47.754
<i>So, what's up?</i>

09:47.754 --> 09:49.464
No. Nothing.
Just looking forward to seeing you.

09:49.464 --> 09:50.591
- Yeah?
- <i>Sorry.</i>

09:50.591 --> 09:52.217
Did I say you? I meant my Toblerone.

09:52.676 --> 09:53.594
<i>Charming.</i>

09:53.594 --> 09:55.888
If we get delayed any longer,
you'll be lucky if it makes it home.

09:55.888 --> 09:57.389
- <i>Yeah. Honestly, Lisa,</i>
- No.

09:57.389 --> 09:59.808
- I've never been so hungry in all my life.
- <i>Don't you dare, Veggie.</i>

09:59.808 --> 10:02.227
That Toblerone is
the only thing that's keeping me going.

10:02.227 --> 10:04.062
I am dangerously bored right now.

10:04.062 --> 10:05.564
9:00!

10:05.564 --> 10:07.691
Okay. And I'm boring you
with how bored I am.

10:09.359 --> 10:11.320
Why don't you give Danny a call?
You usually do.

10:12.279 --> 10:14.198
Yeah. Only 'cause he's up when I'm up.

10:14.198 --> 10:17.034
But-- No, he's actually--
He's on a date tonight.

10:17.618 --> 10:19.453
Right. Good for him. It's about time.

10:19.453 --> 10:24.041
That's what I thought. It is good for him.
So, yeah.

10:24.041 --> 10:25.667
Everything's all good basically.

10:25.667 --> 10:27.711
Hang on, Leese.
They've breached the barricades.

10:27.711 --> 10:29.379
- <i>I'll text you when I land, okay?</i>
- Okay.

10:32.424 --> 10:33.884
Sorry. We'll just be a few minutes.

10:48.732 --> 10:49.733
Hello. You okay?

10:50.901 --> 10:51.944
Amazing.

10:52.653 --> 10:54.112
- What is?
- She is.

10:55.405 --> 10:56.240
That's good.

10:56.240 --> 10:58.408
Yeah. There I was,
totally worried about everything, right?

10:58.408 --> 11:00.118
She walks in,
sees me acting like a twat, says,

11:00.118 --> 11:01.036
"Bollocks to this."

11:01.036 --> 11:03.580
<i>Takes one look
at the dog piss nettles and says,</i>

11:03.580 --> 11:05.499
<i>"Let's just order in Chinese instead."</i>

11:05.499 --> 11:08.085
Honestly, I think
she's the funniest person I've ever met.

11:08.877 --> 11:09.753
That's great.

11:09.753 --> 11:12.881
Yeah. And also, she just--
She's so easy to talk to.

11:12.881 --> 11:15.050
That's so great. That's really--

11:15.050 --> 11:16.552
- That's amazing.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

11:16.552 --> 11:18.887
So when you're talk--
When the-- With the f--

11:18.887 --> 11:21.139
With the funny thing, why's she so funny?

11:21.139 --> 11:23.684
What's her-- Give me some examples.

11:23.684 --> 11:24.977
What's her style? Like--

11:24.977 --> 11:26.395
Yeah. There was this bit where she--

11:26.395 --> 11:27.855
Honestly, I could not stop--

11:27.855 --> 11:29.356
You know
when you're not supposed to laugh?

11:29.356 --> 11:30.899
Like when you're in school
and you'd get told off.

11:30.899 --> 11:33.402
I just could not stop laughing
and kept going and going and going.

11:33.402 --> 11:34.945
I was cracking up. There was a bit--

11:34.945 --> 11:37.197
What was it? She was--
She was just kind of--

11:37.197 --> 11:39.700
<i>I don't know if it's gonna make
any sense. That's the thing.</i>

11:39.700 --> 11:41.201
It's one of those things
where you had to be there.

11:41.201 --> 11:42.661
That sort of thing. Anyway, I'd better go.

11:42.661 --> 11:44.162
She's probably wondering
why I'm taking so long.

11:44.162 --> 11:45.330
I'll speak to you later. Ciao.

11:46.290 --> 11:47.165
Okay.

12:03.098 --> 12:04.099
Poppy?

12:07.686 --> 12:08.687
Ice cream.

12:43.972 --> 12:45.390
"Toes"?

12:50.979 --> 12:52.105
You're joking.

12:52.105 --> 12:55.067
I'm bloody not.
You think your cat fella is bad?

12:55.067 --> 12:57.110
My neighbor, literally without fail,

12:57.110 --> 13:02.366
sings through my letter box
every night at precisely 1:00 a.m.

13:02.366 --> 13:03.909
He sounds nuts.

13:03.909 --> 13:05.494
Yeah. Nice voice though.

13:05.494 --> 13:06.662
There we go.

13:06.662 --> 13:09.706
Lisa, she has this neighbor that--

13:11.333 --> 13:12.668
Hold on. Sorry.

13:13.585 --> 13:14.586
Talk of the devil.

13:16.171 --> 13:17.214
Sorry. I'll just--

13:17.214 --> 13:19.132
- Must be something important. Sorry.
- Yes. It's okay.

13:27.808 --> 13:28.642
Hi.

13:28.642 --> 13:31.144
Hey. Sorry, I just wanted to let you know,

13:31.144 --> 13:34.648
I've sent you a reset link
for the password for the dating site.

13:34.648 --> 13:36.692
'Cause I was just thinking,
if my account gets hacked,

13:36.692 --> 13:39.194
then your messages will get hacked too.
And that'd be really bad.

13:40.404 --> 13:42.322
Right. Okay. Yeah, thank you.

13:42.322 --> 13:45.909
Yeah. So, is Amy still there?

13:45.909 --> 13:47.870
Yeah, she's still here.

13:47.870 --> 13:50.455
That's great.
She obviously really likes you.

13:50.455 --> 13:51.456
<i>If she didn't,</i>

13:51.456 --> 13:53.709
she definitely would have sent a text
to a friend, getting them to call,

13:53.709 --> 13:56.461
saying there was an emergency
and she had to leave immediately. So...

13:56.461 --> 13:58.755
Right. Okay. Yeah. No one's called.

13:58.755 --> 14:02.134
Yeah. 'Cause usually,
that's within the first 15 minutes.

14:02.134 --> 14:03.594
So if someone calls now,

14:03.594 --> 14:05.137
then it probably is a real emergency.

14:05.721 --> 14:07.639
Right. Thanks for letting me know.

14:07.639 --> 14:13.103
Okay. Yeah, all right. I'll let you go.

14:14.104 --> 14:16.231
Good luck. Have fun.

14:16.231 --> 14:17.482
Yeah. Bye.

14:21.987 --> 14:25.115
- <i>Hi, and welcome to</i> Rapid Recipes.
- Hi.

14:25.115 --> 14:27.784
<i>Now, this recipe
is one of my all-time favorites.</i>

14:27.784 --> 14:30.621
<i>An absolute banger

14:30.621 --> 14:31.622

14:31.622 --> 14:32.748

<i>Okay, are we ready?</i>

14:37.961 --> 14:39.004
Still ready.

14:39.004 --> 14:40.839
<i>So, I came up with this recipe</i>

14:40.839 --> 14:43.258
<i>whilst walking through
the canola flower fields of Gansu,</i>

14:43.258 --> 14:45.385
- <i>which-- I'm not gonna lie--</i>
- Just tell me how to make it.

14:45.385 --> 14:48.347
<i>This method of cooking actually hails
from the Sichuan province.</i>

14:48.347 --> 14:51.058
<i>Traveling the country by rail
is a great way of seeing China</i>

14:51.058 --> 14:52.100
<i>and all it has to offer.</i>

14:52.100 --> 14:54.978
<i>I'll never forget the last words
my grandmother said to me before she died.</i>

14:54.978 --> 14:55.979
Oh, my God. Nobody cares.

14:55.979 --> 14:58.315
<i>Okay, so let's get down to some cooking.</i>

14:58.315 --> 14:59.233
Finally.

14:59.233 --> 15:01.151
<i>Travel to China in five-star--</i>

15:01.735 --> 15:03.820
- No
- Hey.

15:04.488 --> 15:06.615
Hi. How was Aberdeen?

15:07.199 --> 15:09.076
Only really saw
the hotel conference suite.

15:09.076 --> 15:10.327
It was nice though.

15:11.453 --> 15:13.622
- I come with chocolate.
- Thank you.

15:15.958 --> 15:18.377
- Hungry?
- Starving. I was just gonna grab a Huel.

15:18.919 --> 15:20.379
Actually, I thought I might cook.

15:21.880 --> 15:23.465
God, are you feeling okay?

15:23.465 --> 15:24.424
Don't be mean.

15:25.133 --> 15:26.468
He's always doing that.

15:31.849 --> 15:33.892
So, any scandal?

15:34.518 --> 15:37.479
You know, "What happens in Aberdeen,
stays in Aberdeen"?

15:37.980 --> 15:40.899
Not really. Just insurance stuff mainly.

15:40.899 --> 15:42.943
Really? God, that's boring.

15:42.943 --> 15:45.487
I thought conferences
were all about people getting drunk

15:45.487 --> 15:47.781
and having orgies in hotel rooms.

15:47.781 --> 15:51.201
- You've met the people I work with.
- Come on. There must be some gossip.

15:51.201 --> 15:55.873
Who was that one at the Christmas party
who kept stroking your arm all night?

15:55.873 --> 15:56.957
Paula.

15:56.957 --> 15:59.585
She definitely has a dungeon in her house.

16:00.085 --> 16:01.753
- No.
- Yeah.

16:01.753 --> 16:03.797
Although she did
just have her basement converted.

16:03.797 --> 16:04.715
See?

16:05.465 --> 16:08.010
Actually,
I saw this program the other day,

16:08.010 --> 16:11.638
and there was this couple, right,
who were having their basement done up.

16:11.638 --> 16:13.056
What did you do?

16:14.516 --> 16:15.851
Veg.

16:19.771 --> 16:21.315
- So good.
- So good.

16:23.108 --> 16:24.067
Looks great.

16:24.067 --> 16:26.403
Yeah, I managed to scrape
most of the burnt bits off.

16:26.904 --> 16:28.363
So, bon appétit.

16:32.117 --> 16:33.785
- Who's that?
- It's just

16:33.785 --> 16:35.954
Steve from the Milton Keynes office.

16:37.915 --> 16:38.749
Share the joke.

16:39.333 --> 16:40.584
Ri-- Sorry, yeah.

16:40.584 --> 16:42.920
Last night, the whole team,
we went out for dinner.

16:42.920 --> 16:45.005
And we were starving,
so we ended up at Five Guys.

16:45.005 --> 16:48.342
Five Guys?
Wow, you never go to Five Guys with me.

16:48.926 --> 16:50.969
- Right, yeah. Sorry. We were there--
- Sorry.

16:50.969 --> 16:52.471
- Yeah. Go on.
- Yeah, and--

16:53.222 --> 16:54.890
They've got this drinks machine,

16:54.890 --> 16:56.683
where you can pick whatever you want.

16:56.683 --> 16:59.520
- Yeah. Okay.
- So Steve--

16:59.520 --> 17:02.022
- Steve goes up to it...
- Okay.

17:02.022 --> 17:03.190
...and he mixes together--

17:03.190 --> 17:04.691
Oh, God, no. What?

17:04.691 --> 17:09.988
Coke, Coke Zero and Diet Coke.
Like a third of each.

17:10.948 --> 17:11.949
He didn't.

17:11.949 --> 17:13.157
It gets better.

17:13.157 --> 17:14.367
- Okay.
- So then,

17:14.367 --> 17:16.369
he goes over to the guy that works there,

17:16.369 --> 17:19.665
who's looking at him like he is insane.

17:19.665 --> 17:21.208
- I bet he was.
- And

17:21.708 --> 17:23.042
Steve says--

17:25.212 --> 17:26.338
Steve says,

17:27.172 --> 17:30.259
"I'm sorry, I've got a Coke problem."

17:34.596 --> 17:35.514
No way.

17:35.514 --> 17:37.057
Oh, man.

17:37.057 --> 17:39.768
I thought they were gonna
throw us out or something.

17:39.768 --> 17:44.064
Yeah, I bet you did.
God, that is just so Steve, isn't it?

17:44.898 --> 17:45.732
Have you met him before?

17:45.732 --> 17:47.901
No. But I feel like I have now.

17:47.901 --> 17:49.361
Oh, yeah. Man.

17:49.361 --> 17:51.405
The guy is such a joker.

17:57.786 --> 17:58.996
Kills me.

17:58.996 --> 18:00.372
You know what we should do?

18:00.372 --> 18:01.874
I've got some cards.

18:01.874 --> 18:04.835
They're called Spicy Talk.

18:04.835 --> 18:06.628
- Spicy Talk?
- That's right.

18:06.628 --> 18:09.464
They're like a "where'd you
lose your virginity" sort of thing.

18:09.464 --> 18:10.465
They're a gift from Lisa.

18:10.465 --> 18:11.717
Could be fun?

18:11.717 --> 18:12.676
- Yeah, I'm game.
- Yeah?

18:12.676 --> 18:13.760
Sure.

18:14.428 --> 18:15.554
Question one.

18:15.554 --> 18:18.223
"Where is the wildest place
you have ever had sex?"

18:18.223 --> 18:19.183
My mum and dad's bed.

18:19.975 --> 18:21.185
A mini submarine.

18:21.185 --> 18:22.519
Basildon.

18:22.519 --> 18:23.729
Trust me. It's crazy.

18:24.479 --> 18:26.773
"Tell me the story of your first love."

18:26.773 --> 18:27.733
Serena Williams.

18:27.733 --> 18:30.444
I had this recurring dream
about her challenging me

18:30.444 --> 18:33.697
to an arm wrestle. She beat me every time.

18:33.697 --> 18:35.282
That one's quite specific, isn't it?

18:35.282 --> 18:37.201
Wonder Woman. Figurine.

18:38.410 --> 18:40.913
Yeah, I sandpapered her uniform off.

18:40.913 --> 18:41.914
To see her naked.

18:42.915 --> 18:44.875
Things didn't work out
for obvious reasons.

18:46.043 --> 18:47.336
"What do you think is your best quality?"

18:47.336 --> 18:48.587
My lung capacity.

18:48.587 --> 18:50.589
Yeah, I can hold my breath
for four and a half minutes.

18:51.507 --> 18:56.386
Looking on the bright side of life.
Plus, a great arse.

18:56.386 --> 18:58.514
- Humble.
- What about you?

18:58.514 --> 19:00.390
I'd say probably that I'm quiet.

19:01.433 --> 19:02.392
My jizz.

19:02.392 --> 19:04.061
And I like to tidy up after myself.

19:04.061 --> 19:05.312
- So sexy.
- Isn't it?

19:05.312 --> 19:06.855
- Yeah.
- Then rounding off the full package,

19:06.855 --> 19:07.898
I like to stay out of the way.

19:09.691 --> 19:11.443
"Weirdest sexual fantasy?"

19:11.443 --> 19:12.736
I have one, but it's not mine.

19:14.196 --> 19:15.072
You already know that.

19:15.072 --> 19:17.199
Oh, yeah. Course.

19:17.199 --> 19:18.784
You never told anyone though, did you?

19:18.784 --> 19:20.327
What? Oh, no. Definitely not.

19:20.327 --> 19:23.872
So, the sound of Marge Simpson's voice
actually gave him the horn.

19:23.872 --> 19:26.250
You know I was really drunk
when I said that.

19:26.959 --> 19:29.545
"Tell me something
you've never told anyone."

19:30.128 --> 19:31.588
I don't know what a meme is.

19:32.214 --> 19:33.382
I don't mind Coldplay.

19:33.382 --> 19:35.676
- You're a monster. Too far.
- I'm so sorry.

19:35.676 --> 19:36.844
I'm gonna leave my own flat.

19:36.844 --> 19:39.763
Do you know what,
I can't really think of anything.

19:39.763 --> 19:42.683
You're lying to me. You are.
You're doing that thing with your nose

19:42.683 --> 19:43.934
- when you're hiding something.
- No.

19:43.934 --> 19:46.645
Tell me what it is.
Tell me what you're hiding.

19:47.354 --> 19:49.523
- Tell me, tell me.
- Okay. Okay.

19:49.523 --> 19:52.109
<i>You remember the Michael Bublé concert
we went to</i>

19:52.109 --> 19:53.569
<i>when I got a bit carried away</i>

19:53.569 --> 19:55.946
<i>and had all those espresso martinis
by mistake?</i>

19:57.364 --> 20:00.033
<i>The next day I was out running
and they all sort of hit me.</i>

20:02.411 --> 20:04.121
<i>Then something happened.</i>

20:05.205 --> 20:06.039
<i>Something else.</i>

20:09.293 --> 20:10.127
Go away.

20:10.127 --> 20:14.298
Ruby! Here, girl. Ruby? Where are you?

20:16.967 --> 20:17.968
Ruby?

20:18.677 --> 20:20.971
- Lovely morning.
- Hiya.

20:21.638 --> 20:23.223
- Ruby?
- <i>It wasn't until I looked back</i>

20:23.223 --> 20:24.433
<i>that I realized she was doing it.</i>

20:25.225 --> 20:27.186
How did you do such a massive poo-poo?

20:30.022 --> 20:31.106
No! Veggie!

20:31.106 --> 20:33.150
Don't laugh at that. It's not funny.

20:33.734 --> 20:35.444
The dog was tiny.

20:35.444 --> 20:37.738
How she thought it came out of it,
what's she feeding it?

20:43.660 --> 20:44.828
I need to get to bed.

20:44.828 --> 20:46.663
I really wanna have a workout
in the morning.

20:48.248 --> 20:49.082
Sorry.

20:49.917 --> 20:51.001
Okay.

20:54.671 --> 20:55.881
Love you.

20:55.881 --> 20:58.050
Night.

21:08.602 --> 21:10.479
Yeah. And now actually try.

21:10.479 --> 21:11.980
- I am trying.
- Okay.

21:11.980 --> 21:14.316
Is this the first time
you've ever done this?

21:14.316 --> 21:15.234
Can you tell?

21:15.234 --> 21:16.944
Fast, fast, fast. As fast you can.

21:16.944 --> 21:18.946
Yeah, that looks really good.

21:18.946 --> 21:21.323
- Is that it?
- Yes. And hook!

21:23.116 --> 21:24.451
There we go. Dead. Gone.

21:24.451 --> 21:26.203
Yeah. Eh, jab!

21:26.203 --> 21:28.330
Jab, jab, jab. Super-- Superspeed.

21:28.330 --> 21:30.457
Yeah. As fast as you can.
You're better than you thought.

21:33.669 --> 21:34.753
Veg?

21:34.753 --> 21:35.754
Yeah?

21:35.754 --> 21:36.839
I'll come too.

21:36.839 --> 21:37.756
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

21:37.756 --> 21:38.674
Great.

21:40.384 --> 21:41.593
<i>Any minute now,</i>

21:41.593 --> 21:46.014
<i>you'll be ready to sleep the sleep
of a thousand dreams.</i>

21:46.557 --> 21:49.434
<i>Let me take you on a journey of discovery.</i>

21:49.434 --> 21:52.604
<i>Let my voice wash over your body,</i>

21:53.188 --> 21:56.149
<i>as together we peel back the layers.</i>

21:56.149 --> 21:58.068
<i>Exposing ourselves to--</i>

22:02.197 --> 22:03.198
Veggie?

22:04.992 --> 22:06.076
Vegger?

22:07.369 --> 22:10.914
If you had to live without one part
of your body, what would it be?

22:11.498 --> 22:13.041
Yeah. I'll sort it in the morning.

22:22.593 --> 22:24.136
Only three more miles to go.

22:24.970 --> 22:26.221
Great. Yeah...

22:47.117 --> 22:49.411
- Who died?
- What? Mum. Nobody.

22:49.411 --> 22:51.496
Come on, Leese. You know the rules.

22:51.496 --> 22:54.166
Anything after 10:30
has to be death-related.

22:54.166 --> 22:56.835
Oh, yeah. Sorry. I forgot. No. It's just--

22:56.835 --> 22:59.087
Come on. Out with it.

22:59.087 --> 23:01.715
No. Nothing. Just--
Okay, look, tiny thing.

23:02.758 --> 23:05.469
- You think I'm funny, right?
- Funny as in weird or funny ha ha?

23:05.469 --> 23:06.970
- Funny ha ha.
- Leese,

23:06.970 --> 23:08.430
I'm not the right person to ask.

23:08.430 --> 23:10.265
You know
how uncomfortable I get around laughter.

23:10.265 --> 23:11.975
All right. Forget I said anything.

23:12.601 --> 23:13.435
How's Poppy?

23:13.435 --> 23:14.561
Yeah, she's fine.

23:14.561 --> 23:15.938
And Veggie?

23:15.938 --> 23:18.357
Yeah, you know. He's working hard.

23:20.442 --> 23:21.276
Leese?

23:21.985 --> 23:23.320
Why did you really call me?

23:24.696 --> 23:27.908
I had better go. My taxi's outside.

23:27.908 --> 23:31.745
Yeah. This was fun. It was nice and stuff.

23:31.745 --> 23:34.122
Maybe we should do it again,
if you want to.

23:34.122 --> 23:37.000
Yes. I'd love to.

23:37.000 --> 23:37.918
Yeah?

23:37.918 --> 23:40.379
But no, I don't think so.

23:42.297 --> 23:47.010
Danny, you're sweet. You're funny.
You're bloody weird. I like you.

23:47.010 --> 23:50.430
That all sounds like good stuff.
Where did I go wrong?

23:51.306 --> 23:53.392
Do you know what you spent
half of the night talking about?

23:55.227 --> 23:57.896
Your ex. You're obviously not over her.

23:57.896 --> 24:00.065
Wait. Chloe? I don't remember talking
about Chloe at all.

24:00.065 --> 24:03.527
Chloe? No, I'm talking about the one
who kept calling you all night. Lisa.

24:03.527 --> 24:06.697
Lisa? No, no, no.
She's not my ex. We're just mates.

24:08.323 --> 24:09.992
I hate to break it to you, but you're not.

24:11.159 --> 24:12.452
Not from where I'm standing.

24:12.452 --> 24:13.412
Honestly, Mum.

24:13.412 --> 24:15.873
Me and Veggie, we're good. We're good.

24:15.873 --> 24:19.376
You know what I think of Veggie.
The way he treats you.

24:19.376 --> 24:22.087
<i>The way he's taken on Poppy
like she's his own.</i>

24:22.087 --> 24:26.925
What that man lacks in personality,
he makes up for in reliability.

24:27.634 --> 24:28.760
<i>I think he's great.</i>

24:28.760 --> 24:30.262
Yeah, I know he's great.

24:30.262 --> 24:33.557
But you don't owe anyone anything
in this life, Leese.

24:33.557 --> 24:36.643
<i>If you're questioning things,
if you're having doubts,</i>

24:36.643 --> 24:41.899
if that's what this is, then it's okay.
It doesn't make you a bad person.

24:43.859 --> 24:46.612
No, honestly, I think I'm just--
It's just lack of sleep.

24:46.612 --> 24:47.821
I'll be fine in the morning.

24:48.989 --> 24:50.157
All right. If you're sure.

24:50.157 --> 24:53.076
- Yeah, I am. Thanks.
- For what?

24:53.076 --> 24:54.912
- For listening.
- <i>I'm your mum, aren't I?</i>

24:54.912 --> 24:55.829
Yeah.

24:56.747 --> 24:58.540
And you do think
I'm funny ha ha, right, Mum?

24:58.540 --> 25:00.042
<i>Don't beat yourself up.</i>

25:00.042 --> 25:03.170
Me and your dad was never funny,
so it's not your fault.

25:03.170 --> 25:04.171
What? Mum.

25:04.880 --> 25:05.714
Great.

25:05.714 --> 25:08.425
Now the birds are up.
Gonna have to find me earplugs now.

25:08.425 --> 25:10.677
<i>Look, try and get some sleep, all right?</i>

25:10.677 --> 25:12.888
- Okay. Night.
- <i>Bye. Night night.</i>

25:16.183 --> 25:17.476
I'm well funny.

25:18.393 --> 25:19.353
Shame.

25:21.647 --> 25:23.524
I think we'd have been brilliant together.

25:23.524 --> 25:24.441
Yeah.

25:28.862 --> 25:29.863
Bye, Danny.

25:29.863 --> 25:30.948
Bye, Amy.

25:39.414 --> 25:41.834
Maybe give me a call if you ever--

25:41.834 --> 25:42.876
Oh, God!

25:42.876 --> 25:44.211
Get it out! Get it out!

25:44.211 --> 25:45.921
Oh, God. Hang on.

25:47.422 --> 25:49.174
Please.

25:50.509 --> 25:51.760
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

25:51.760 --> 25:53.053
Adam, quick! It's an emergency!

25:53.846 --> 25:55.389
My bloody finger.

25:55.389 --> 25:57.432
Yeah. Where is it?

25:59.059 --> 26:01.645
Okay. I've got it. I've got it.

26:05.649 --> 26:06.942
Adam, bring ice!

26:08.777 --> 26:10.571
Don't panic. It's all right.

26:12.614 --> 26:13.740
What are you doing?

26:16.451 --> 26:17.452
Who needed ice?

26:42.436 --> 26:46.190
<i>Hiya. Hope you had a good night.
Just checking in.</i>

26:46.773 --> 26:48.317
<i>Yeah. Knock knock.</i>

26:49.359 --> 26:51.612
<i>Come on, Danny. Join in. Knock knock.</i>

26:52.654 --> 26:53.572
Who's there?

26:53.572 --> 26:55.616
- <i>Control freak.</i>
- Control--

26:55.616 --> 26:57.242
<i>Now you say, "Control freak who?"</i>

26:57.242 --> 27:00.537
<i>Anyway, hope tonight was fun. Speak soon.</i>
