WEBVTT

00:04.255 --> 00:05.798
Dad, are they gonna
separate you from me?

00:05.881 --> 00:07.299
Why do you ask that?

00:07.383 --> 00:09.176
Because you haven't been
a very good dad.

00:09.260 --> 00:11.429
DANIEL: I promise,
I'm gonna do better.

00:11.512 --> 00:13.514
ETHAN: It was so easy for me
to see Crockett

00:13.597 --> 00:15.433
as the problem.
APRIL: Whatever happened between

00:15.516 --> 00:17.017
- and him in the past...
- I get it now.

00:17.101 --> 00:20.020
Because the real problem
was always right here.

00:20.104 --> 00:22.815
Whatever it is you want,
it isn't me.

00:23.691 --> 00:25.943
It's been a really
good couple of weeks.

00:26.569 --> 00:28.487
WILL: Yeah, it has.
And not just us. Rehab.

00:28.571 --> 00:30.364
You've been knocking it
out of the park.

00:30.448 --> 00:31.574
I'm really proud of you.

00:42.084 --> 00:43.085
Hey.

00:43.169 --> 00:45.713
Hey. Sorry, I was
trying not to wake you.

00:45.796 --> 00:47.923
Where you headed so early?

00:48.007 --> 00:49.133
To a meeting.

00:49.216 --> 00:50.426
Feel like
I could use one.

00:50.509 --> 00:52.344
Wait a second, I'll get dressed
and drive you.

00:52.428 --> 00:54.764
No. No, no, no.
Stay in bed.

00:54.847 --> 00:56.724
I'll see you at work.

01:00.686 --> 01:01.687
Bye.

01:05.024 --> 01:06.317
(EXHALES HEAVILY)

01:09.153 --> 01:10.446
(DOOR CLOSES)

01:11.363 --> 01:13.115
Hannah, you forgot
your phone.

01:21.332 --> 01:23.000
Dr. Moody said you
were the one to see.

01:23.083 --> 01:24.627
That you'd take
good care of us.

01:24.710 --> 01:26.670
Yeah, Moody and I
go way back.

01:26.754 --> 01:27.963
Medical school.

01:28.047 --> 01:29.423
We used to ride
motorcycles together.

01:29.507 --> 01:31.759
Doctor Moody
rode a motorcycle?

01:31.842 --> 01:34.929
Yeah, but he had to give it up
when he became a pediatrician.

01:35.012 --> 01:37.306
The stethoscope kept flying off
his neck on the way to work.

01:37.389 --> 01:40.059
(ALL CHUCKLE)
- Please don't give Billy any ideas.

01:40.142 --> 01:41.811
I have enough worries
with him on his bike.

01:41.894 --> 01:43.062
Uh–oh.

01:43.145 --> 01:44.605
You like riding
your bike, Billy?

01:44.688 --> 01:46.607
BILLY: Yeah. But my mom
won't let me ride at night.

01:46.690 --> 01:48.943
That's probably a good thing, bud.
TECHNICIAN: X–ray's ready.

01:49.026 --> 01:50.194
- Step back, please.
- Mmm–hmm.

01:50.277 --> 01:51.904
MARCEL: Can you hold your
breath for me, Billy?

01:51.987 --> 01:53.280
Ready?

01:56.867 --> 01:59.787
Got a couple of
non–displaced cracked ribs.

01:59.870 --> 02:02.456
The issue is this hemothorax
here, in Billy's chest.

02:02.540 --> 02:04.291
Hemothorax?
That sounds bad.

02:04.375 --> 02:05.668
No, it's just
a buildup of blood

02:05.751 --> 02:06.961
between the lung
and chest wall.

02:07.044 --> 02:09.380
It explains why he's been
having difficulty breathing.

02:09.463 --> 02:11.674
But we can fix that.
We just have to drain the blood.

02:11.757 --> 02:12.883
Does that mean surgery?

02:12.967 --> 02:14.009
MARCEL: Oh, hopefully not.

02:14.093 --> 02:15.511
We're gonna try
a chest tube first.

02:15.594 --> 02:16.804
Set me up for
a 28 French Tube.

02:16.887 --> 02:18.097
NURSE: Yes, doctor.

02:18.180 --> 02:20.057
MARCEL: Okay, Billy,
I'm gonna bring you back.

02:22.434 --> 02:24.186
Now, can you lift
that left arm for me?

02:24.270 --> 02:26.063
Maybe.
(INHALES SHARPLY)

02:26.146 --> 02:28.732
Oh, yeah,
I know it's sore.

02:28.816 --> 02:31.110
All right. This next part's
gonna hurt a little bit.

02:31.193 --> 02:32.236
Think you can handle it?

02:32.319 --> 02:34.071
I'll be okay.

02:34.154 --> 02:35.656
That's what
I like to hear.

02:35.739 --> 02:37.741
Billy was born with
a diaphragmatic hernia,

02:37.825 --> 02:41.579
so, unfortunately,
he's no stranger to hospitals.

02:41.662 --> 02:44.123
Well, you are very brave,
Billy. And you're doing great.

02:44.206 --> 02:45.207
MARCEL:
Speaking of, Billy,

02:45.291 --> 02:47.418
how comeI ain't never seen
you and Spider–Man

02:47.501 --> 02:48.878
in the same place
at the same time?

02:48.961 --> 02:50.462
(DONNA CHUCKLES)

02:50.546 --> 02:52.464
MARCEL: Almost done.
(INHALES SHARPLY)

02:54.466 --> 02:56.886
Must be torture to watch
your kid suffer like that.

02:56.969 --> 02:58.178
Yeah, I'm sure it is.

02:58.262 --> 02:59.722
You ever think
about having kids?

02:59.805 --> 03:01.724
Oh, no. Kids are
not my speed.

03:01.807 --> 03:02.808
And why is that?

03:02.892 --> 03:04.810
Dr. Marcel.

03:04.894 --> 03:07.563
- Detective Poulson, Chicago PD.
- Doc.

03:07.646 --> 03:09.565
And Detectives
Bridges and Hayes

03:09.648 --> 03:11.567
from the New Orleans
Police department.

03:11.650 --> 03:13.944
- Oh. My old stomping grounds.
-Oh, yeah?

03:14.028 --> 03:15.821
Yeah. What can I do
for you gentlemen?

03:15.905 --> 03:19.575
- I'm just an escort today.
- Okay.

03:19.658 --> 03:22.286
Uh, Detective Hayes and I,
we're following up a detail

03:22.369 --> 03:24.538
from this cold case
that popped back up recently.

03:24.622 --> 03:25.706
Uh–huh.

03:26.665 --> 03:28.125
You mind if we talk
in private?

03:28.208 --> 03:30.961
Uh, the consultation room
is free.

03:31.045 --> 03:32.463
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

03:32.546 --> 03:34.214
- Follow me.
- All right.

03:34.298 --> 03:35.549
POULSON: Gentlemen?

03:36.467 --> 03:37.593
Cold case?

03:37.676 --> 03:41.639
Yeah, from a homicide
from their town.

03:41.722 --> 03:44.016
And they came all the way
up here to talk to Crockett?

03:44.099 --> 03:45.726
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

03:45.809 --> 03:47.436
They weren't
willing to share.

04:21.679 --> 04:22.721
Hey.

04:24.515 --> 04:25.516
Hey.

04:26.266 --> 04:28.102
I haven't seen you around
the last few days.

04:30.020 --> 04:32.272
I've been doing ride–alongs
with the medics.

04:32.356 --> 04:33.524
Nice of you
to help them out.

04:36.193 --> 04:37.444
Um...

04:38.696 --> 04:41.490
I got the last of my stuff
out of your apartment,

04:41.573 --> 04:44.034
so, here.

04:53.085 --> 04:55.129
I know you'll be happy
to move back in.

04:57.172 --> 04:58.173
Thanks.

05:03.178 --> 05:04.346
I should go.

05:21.488 --> 05:22.531

GCS 12, vitals stable.

on four liters O2.

05:30.706 --> 05:32.249
Found collapsed
in the DePaul library.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.585
Looks like he suffered
a penetrating injury to the chest.

05:34.668 --> 05:37.921
Okay. On my count.
One, two, three.

05:39.590 --> 05:42.342
Is that a needle?
LANIK: Let's get an X–ray. AP and lateral.

05:42.426 --> 05:45.012
Hey, Trent, I'm Dr. Lanik.
You're okay.

05:45.095 --> 05:46.597
I'm gonna remove
this needle, Trent,

05:46.680 --> 05:47.890
but I gotta take
a picture first

05:47.973 --> 05:50.726
- to make sure we're not flying blind.
- No, no! Don't take it out!

05:50.809 --> 05:52.644

(GRUNTING)

05:53.228 --> 05:54.229
Get off of me!

05:54.313 --> 05:56.273
Get that X–ray already!
He pushed it deeper.

05:56.356 --> 05:57.858
I can't take it
if he won't stay still.

05:57.941 --> 05:59.485
- Get off of me!
- Push two Versed.

- Hi, Maggie.

06:21.882 --> 06:24.843
Hmm. Dad dragged you
into work today?

06:24.927 --> 06:25.928
I did no such thing.

06:26.011 --> 06:28.889
Oh, no. I... I like spending time
with my dad. I wanted to come.

06:30.224 --> 06:32.017
Uh, wants to volunteer,
actually.

06:32.101 --> 06:33.477
Oh, really?

06:33.560 --> 06:36.230
No school today?
ANNA: Not really.

06:36.313 --> 06:38.524
My class went on a field trip
to a science museum.

06:38.607 --> 06:40.859
But I figured I'd learn more
about science here.

06:40.943 --> 06:43.195
I don't know about all that.
But maybe

06:43.278 --> 06:46.281
Deandra over in Pediatrics
can use some help.

Our friend
here's insides.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.720
Those are sewing needles.

07:08.804 --> 07:11.348
Four in all, which he seems
to have put there himself.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.016
I was able
to remove this one,

07:13.100 --> 07:16.103
which was only partially submerged.
But that one there,

07:16.186 --> 07:18.772
it managed to get all
the way into his heart.

07:18.856 --> 07:20.023
I'm gonna do
a cardio workup,

07:20.107 --> 07:21.316
but after that,
he's all yours.

07:25.571 --> 07:28.574

07:28.657 --> 07:30.033
Ah, more than
I'd like to admit.

07:30.117 --> 07:31.160
Sorry, man.

07:31.827 --> 07:33.287
When did you first
notice the rash?

07:33.370 --> 07:35.038
Uh, about a week ago.

07:35.122 --> 07:36.498
I was hoping
it would go away.

07:36.582 --> 07:38.458
It's good
you're here now.

07:38.542 --> 07:41.170
You have cellulitis,
bacterial infection.

07:41.253 --> 07:42.963
I want to get you started
on an antibiotic.

07:43.046 --> 07:44.464
Roger, are you
allergic to penicillin?

07:44.548 --> 07:46.258
Uh, not that I know of.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

07:47.634 --> 07:49.011
Looks like
Mr. Larusso was here

07:49.094 --> 07:50.179
about three years back.

07:50.262 --> 07:51.805
And you were
his attending.

07:52.514 --> 07:53.807
I, uh...

07:53.891 --> 07:55.475
I thought
he looked familiar.

07:55.559 --> 07:57.352
I apologize for
not recognizing you.

07:57.436 --> 07:59.104
It's all right.

07:59.188 --> 08:01.148
I'm sure you see a lot of patients.
WILL: Yeah.

08:01.231 --> 08:03.692
Okay, so, I see here,
you had a prior infection?

08:04.484 --> 08:05.485
Uh–huh.

08:05.569 --> 08:08.280
And we treated it
with cefazolin last time?

08:09.323 --> 08:10.574
Uh, I don't remember.
(CHUCKLES)

08:10.657 --> 08:12.409
My mind's a sieve.

08:12.492 --> 08:13.702
That's all right.

08:13.785 --> 08:15.204
I'm worried this rash
is the same bacteria.

08:15.287 --> 08:16.496
I wanna make sure
we stay ahead of it.

08:16.580 --> 08:18.040
Doris, start him
on an IV?

08:18.123 --> 08:19.666
- Mmm–hmm.
- And at least we know

08:19.750 --> 08:22.002
we had success with
that drug already.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.504
Uh, What...
What's that for?

08:24.588 --> 08:26.173
It's just to
monitor the rash.

08:26.256 --> 08:29.134
I want to make sure it shrinks
down some before I discharge you.

08:29.218 --> 08:33.388
Okay, now, your emergency contact
has your wife listed.

08:33.472 --> 08:34.640
You want us to call her

08:34.723 --> 08:36.433
and tell her we'll be keeping you here
for a few more hours?

08:36.516 --> 08:39.978
Uh, no. Don't worry about that.
I'll... I'll give her a call.

08:40.062 --> 08:41.063
All right, then.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.485
- Is something wrong?
- What's going on?

08:46.568 --> 08:49.238
(SIGHS) The chest tube
should've drained more blood.

08:49.321 --> 08:51.531
Yeah, it's been a few days
since he's been hurt,

08:51.615 --> 08:53.659
there's a chance
the hemothorax is mostly clot.

08:53.742 --> 08:56.203
Let's get him up
for a non–contrast chest CT.

08:56.286 --> 08:57.871
I should've taken him in
to see Dr. Moody earlier.

08:57.955 --> 08:59.456
No, you didn't do
anything wrong.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.875
Billy, you mind if we speak
with your mom outside?

09:01.959 --> 09:03.585
- Okay, thanks, bud.
- I'll be back.

09:05.587 --> 09:08.340
So, if the CT shows me
what I think it is,

09:08.423 --> 09:10.050
I'm recommending
surgery.

09:10.133 --> 09:12.261
- Oh, God.
- No, I know that sounds scary,

09:12.344 --> 09:14.930
but the procedure,
a video–assisted thoracoscopy

09:15.013 --> 09:16.306
is minimally invasive.

09:16.390 --> 09:18.392
We use a scope
to clean out his chest.

09:18.475 --> 09:20.227
When Billy was a baby,
he had to go on ECMO.

09:20.310 --> 09:22.271
After all
the transfusions,

09:22.354 --> 09:23.730
he developed
antibodies in his blood.

09:23.814 --> 09:25.399
I guess to help
his immune system.

09:25.482 --> 09:26.650
Yeah, Moody told me.

09:26.733 --> 09:28.568
But I think we should be able
to find compatible blood.

09:28.652 --> 09:31.446
Yeah, I'll have the blood bank
start sourcing antibody–matched blood.

09:31.530 --> 09:34.408
Billy's gonna get
the best care possible.

09:34.491 --> 09:36.076
- And nothing to eat or drink.
- Okay.

09:36.159 --> 09:37.577
- All right.
- Thank you.

09:37.661 --> 09:38.996
- Schedule him in, in a bit.
- Sure.

09:40.914 --> 09:42.040
- Hey, Crockett.
- Yeah.

09:42.124 --> 09:44.084
What's all that
with the detectives?

09:44.167 --> 09:46.295
They're investigating a murder
from seven years back.

09:46.378 --> 09:47.754
Well, what'd they
want with you?

09:49.172 --> 09:51.300
I get the impression
they think I'm a suspect.

09:51.383 --> 09:53.760
Why would
they think that?

09:53.844 --> 09:56.638
'Cause they claim to have gotten
my DNA at the scene.

10:09.359 --> 10:12.154
So, um, let's talk about
these needles.

10:12.237 --> 10:15.115
Can you tell me about the first time
this happened?

10:16.825 --> 10:18.201
I'm really embarrassed.

10:18.285 --> 10:19.328
Trent, don't be.

10:19.411 --> 10:21.330
If you knew
how many instances

10:21.413 --> 10:23.123
of self–harm
I saw in this hospital...

10:23.206 --> 10:25.667
Self–harm?
No, I wasn't trying to hurt myself.

10:25.751 --> 10:28.503
I was trying to
make myself feel better.

10:28.587 --> 10:29.671
Okay.

10:29.755 --> 10:32.049
Yeah, I'm under
a ton of pressure right now.

10:32.132 --> 10:34.718
I have to defend
my dissertation next month,

10:34.801 --> 10:36.803
and it's been
messing me up.

10:36.887 --> 10:39.723
My heart races, I get nervous.
There's this press...

10:39.806 --> 10:42.309
There's this pressure
in my chest that I can't get rid of.

10:42.392 --> 10:45.270
And the needles,
they alleviate that pressure?

10:45.354 --> 10:46.980
Yeah, I know
it sounds insane,

10:47.064 --> 10:49.858
but it's the only thing
that helps.

10:49.941 --> 10:51.693
I'm telling you,

10:51.777 --> 10:54.112
there's something
wrong with my heart.

10:54.196 --> 10:57.282
Look, I absolutely believe
that it feels that way to you,

10:57.366 --> 11:00.327
but the EKG
says otherwise.

11:05.665 --> 11:08.043
Trent is a PhD candidate
at DePaul.

11:08.126 --> 11:12.381
And recently, his anxiety is kicking up
this pretty bizarre compulsion.

11:12.464 --> 11:14.883
- Like OCD?
- Well, I mean, kind of,

11:14.966 --> 11:16.676
but instead of washing
his hands incessantly,

11:16.760 --> 11:18.095
he's sticking needles in his chest.

11:18.178 --> 11:20.514
- You get a look at his scans?
- Yes.

11:23.266 --> 11:26.019
This needle appears to be floating free
in his right ventricle.

11:26.103 --> 11:27.604
At the moment,
it's not doing any damage.

11:27.687 --> 11:28.688
But if it were to move...

11:28.772 --> 11:30.273
It's gonna get
spit out into his lungs.

11:30.357 --> 11:31.650
Could become
a huge mess.

11:31.733 --> 11:33.527
Most likely
a pulmonary embolism.

11:33.610 --> 11:35.612
So, gonna
schedule him today?

11:35.695 --> 11:36.863
I have reservations.

11:38.115 --> 11:39.574
Is the patient suicidal?

11:39.658 --> 11:41.493
Hmm. I mean,
not consciously.

11:41.576 --> 11:44.538
But I can't argue
that the behavior isn't life–threatening.

11:44.621 --> 11:45.747
So then
he may be inclined

11:45.831 --> 11:48.625
to reinsert the needles
even if we do pull them out.

11:48.708 --> 11:52.129
How long will it take
for you to assess his compulsion?

11:52.212 --> 11:54.923
Getting to the root
of his anxiety,

11:55.006 --> 11:57.467
remapping his coping skills,
I mean, that's gonna take some time.

11:57.551 --> 11:59.261
But we'll get
right into it post–op.

11:59.344 --> 12:00.429
Hmm, fair enough.

12:00.512 --> 12:02.597
I will proceed with
removing the needles.

12:02.681 --> 12:04.224
But you'll have to get his consent.

12:04.307 --> 12:05.517
I'll work on that.

12:10.021 --> 12:11.398
Hey, sweetie.

12:11.481 --> 12:13.567
I got kicked off
the peds floor.

12:13.650 --> 12:15.152
What?

12:15.235 --> 12:16.695
Deandra said that
she wouldn't get off her phone.

12:16.778 --> 12:18.905
I thought you wanted
to be here.

12:18.989 --> 12:19.990
I do.

12:20.073 --> 12:22.242
I just didn't think
everyone would be so uptight.

12:22.325 --> 12:24.661
Do I need to
confiscate that thing?

12:24.744 --> 12:25.954
What? No.

12:26.037 --> 12:27.831
Put it in your pocket
and keep it there.

12:27.914 --> 12:28.915
You know what,

12:28.999 --> 12:30.625
Leah in the waiting room
needs some help.

12:30.709 --> 12:32.586
Ideally, something
that requires two thumbs?

12:32.669 --> 12:34.546
Mmm–hmm.
She'll keep her busy.

12:35.422 --> 12:36.840
Okay. (SIGHS)

12:43.889 --> 12:45.515
Hi, I'm Dr. Halstead.

12:46.725 --> 12:48.393
Can you tell me
your name?

12:49.978 --> 12:51.146
Yes, I can.

12:54.691 --> 12:56.610
Oh. This is a test.

12:58.195 --> 13:00.530
Right then,
my name is Christian.

13:00.614 --> 13:01.990
Pleased to make
your acquaintance.

13:03.533 --> 13:05.827
WILL: Pretty nasty infection
there, Christian.

13:05.911 --> 13:07.204
Is that why
you came in today?

13:08.413 --> 13:10.790
Christian, hey?
You with me?

13:10.874 --> 13:12.709
Mmm–hmm.
All the way.

13:12.792 --> 13:15.837
Your vein's rock–hard.
When did you last shoot up?

13:17.047 --> 13:19.132
Ah... Oh...

13:20.467 --> 13:21.885
What day is today?

13:21.968 --> 13:24.179
Okay. Let's consent him
for an I&amp;D.

13:24.262 --> 13:25.805
HANNAH: Sorry
that took so long.

13:25.889 --> 13:27.641
They made me park out
in the satellite lot.

13:27.724 --> 13:28.725
That's all right.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.727
I'll just be
a few minutes.

13:31.728 --> 13:35.649
There you are, love.
I was afraid you'd abandoned me.

13:42.322 --> 13:43.907
You two know each other?

13:43.990 --> 13:46.326
Uh, Christian's
an old friend.

13:46.409 --> 13:48.537
CHRISTIAN: Old friends,
two of us.

13:48.620 --> 13:51.039
Okay, not here.
Okay.

13:51.122 --> 13:52.541
Will, can we talk?

13:54.668 --> 13:56.461
I'll get those
off you later.

14:00.006 --> 14:01.758
I know that
this looks strange.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.343
Well...

14:03.426 --> 14:05.595
We used to date
about a year ago.

14:06.846 --> 14:09.307
Another part of my past
I'm trying to put behind me.

14:10.767 --> 14:12.269
I thought you were
going to the meeting.

14:12.352 --> 14:14.729
Yeah, I was. I did.

14:14.813 --> 14:17.023
And things were just winding up
when I got this call from Christian.

14:17.107 --> 14:18.942
When I saw how
bad his arm was,

14:19.025 --> 14:21.319
I brought him in
straight away.

14:21.403 --> 14:23.446
You... You went
to his house?

14:23.530 --> 14:25.323
You see the state he's in?

14:25.407 --> 14:26.866
He's in no condition
to drive.

14:27.867 --> 14:28.868
Hmm.

14:28.952 --> 14:32.622
I guess I might feel
a little guilty for getting clean.

14:32.706 --> 14:33.957
I understand.

14:35.667 --> 14:36.835
Are we good?

14:36.918 --> 14:38.169
Absolutely.

14:39.921 --> 14:42.882
- Okay.
- Hmm.

Oh, hey, you forgot this
this morning.

14:45.719 --> 14:48.013
Oh. Thank you.

for a cold case murder
in Louisiana.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.213
There's no way.

20:55.296 --> 20:57.799
Listen, I'm just
telling you what I heard.

20:57.882 --> 20:59.258
And DNA
is hard to refute.

21:01.469 --> 21:02.887
I'll let you know
if I hear anything else.

21:02.971 --> 21:04.222
Thank you.

21:07.350 --> 21:08.935
DANIEL: So, here's
where we're at.

21:09.018 --> 21:11.145
We gotta get these needles
out of your chest,

21:11.229 --> 21:14.774
especially the one that's hanging around
in your right ventricle,

21:14.857 --> 21:16.317
and we're gonna
do that tonight.

21:16.401 --> 21:18.444
- Surgery, tonight?
- Yeah.

21:18.528 --> 21:19.821
And then when
you're recovering,

21:19.904 --> 21:22.407
I think it'd be a really good idea
if we would start to address...

21:22.490 --> 21:25.076
How long
will I be here?

21:25.159 --> 21:28.621
In the hospital?
I'd say probably at least three days,

21:28.705 --> 21:29.831
- and then...
- That doesn't work.

21:29.914 --> 21:31.582
I only have
a couple of weeks

21:31.666 --> 21:33.710
until I defend
my dissertation.

21:33.793 --> 21:34.794
And if I fail,

21:34.877 --> 21:38.256
the last five years will have been
a complete waste of my life.

21:38.339 --> 21:39.632
I need to get out of here!

21:39.716 --> 21:41.050
Okay, but you understand
we can't let you

21:41.134 --> 21:43.011
just walk out of here
with a needle in your heart.

21:43.094 --> 21:44.470
Whoa, wait.
Okay, buddy. Here.

21:44.554 --> 21:46.264
Trent, look at me.
Look at me. Look at me.

21:46.347 --> 21:48.182
Trent, Trent, Trent.
Look at me.

21:48.266 --> 21:50.226
Take a deep breath.
In through the nose...

21:50.309 --> 21:52.478
No. You don't understand.
You're ruining my life!

21:52.562 --> 21:53.938
Slow down.
Slow your breathing down.

21:54.022 --> 21:55.398
It's racing. It feels
like it's beating out of my chest!

21:55.481 --> 21:56.774
I'm holding your hand.
Can you feel my hand?

Oh, Dr. Manning,
there you are.

22:23.176 --> 22:26.304
I'm Dr. Julian Moody,
Billy Harris' pediatrician.

22:26.387 --> 22:29.432
- Of course. Billy's in surgery right now.
- I know.

22:29.515 --> 22:32.018
His mother called me.
She's concerned about his operation.

22:32.101 --> 22:35.813
She said Dr. Marcel
is in some sort of trouble?

22:35.897 --> 22:37.190
Please.

22:39.275 --> 22:41.778
It can't be true.
Crockett would never hurt anyone.

22:41.861 --> 22:43.362
I know.

22:43.446 --> 22:45.865
If the murder took place
seven years ago,

22:45.948 --> 22:47.325
then that means
that you and Crockett

22:47.408 --> 22:49.494
would've been
at medical school at that time.

22:49.577 --> 22:51.662
- Did you know him well?
- Yeah.

22:51.746 --> 22:54.874
And Crockett was going
through a lot back then,

22:54.957 --> 22:57.043
but no way
was he killing people.

22:57.126 --> 22:58.419
What do you mean?

23:01.214 --> 23:02.423
I shouldn't
have said anything.

consent to surgery.

what's bizarre?

in his chest, right there.

it was psychosomatic.

But then, after this
last episode, he fainted.

26:29.505 --> 26:31.048

to believe that,

26:31.132 --> 26:32.675
I don't know, maybe
there is some kind of

26:32.758 --> 26:34.677

condition there.

free up the room.

- What? Why?

Why? Because clearly it's interfering
with your ability to do your work.

- Well, if that's so important to you,

so you can do it in person.

to come in.

We came to see Brian.
He's a friend of mine.

28:44.473 --> 28:49.145

Brian must've stolen your insurance card.

when he came in.

28:50.771 --> 28:53.190
- No, I gave it to him.
- Roger?

28:53.274 --> 28:56.569
His insurance lapsed
and he needed to see a doctor.

28:56.652 --> 28:58.112
Because I was going off
of your chart,

28:58.195 --> 29:01.323
I treated his skin infection
with a cephalosporin,

29:01.407 --> 29:02.575
which you're
not allergic to.

29:02.658 --> 29:04.743
- Brian is?
- Extremely.

29:04.827 --> 29:06.328
Is he gonna be okay?

29:06.412 --> 29:08.873
The burn surgeons are hopeful
we caught it in time

29:08.956 --> 29:11.000
but there's gonna
be permanent scarring.

29:11.083 --> 29:12.126
Oh, my God.

29:14.462 --> 29:16.130
Do you know
how reckless this was?

29:16.213 --> 29:17.506
I'm sorry.

29:17.590 --> 29:20.676
I didn't know what else to do.
He needed my help.

29:20.759 --> 29:22.553
Well, your help
could've killed him today.

29:26.891 --> 29:28.476
You can't just
keep me here.

29:28.559 --> 29:30.644
I don't understand
why we are doing this again.

29:30.728 --> 29:32.771
Versed wouldn't have had
an effect on his EKG.

29:32.855 --> 29:35.399
No. But it would
affect his anxiety.

29:35.483 --> 29:37.234
I mean, look at his
U wave without it.

29:37.318 --> 29:40.070
- He's tachycardic.
- What is that?

29:40.154 --> 29:41.614
It means your
heart rate's elevated,

29:41.697 --> 29:42.698
because you're anxious.

29:42.781 --> 29:45.075
And it also appears
there's an extra electrical pathway.

29:45.159 --> 29:47.077
Most likely
Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome.

29:47.161 --> 29:50.039
- Wait. What is that?
- It's actually a congenital defect,

29:50.122 --> 29:52.625
that usually becomes
symptomatic around your age.

29:52.708 --> 29:53.834
And it can be
intermittent.

29:53.918 --> 29:55.669
Sometimes only appearing
during exercise.

29:55.753 --> 29:58.464
Or periods of stress
and anxiety.

29:58.547 --> 30:00.549
I can correct this
when I remove the needles.

30:00.633 --> 30:02.676
You... You can make
this all go away?

30:05.262 --> 30:07.848
Yeah. What are we
waiting for?

30:07.932 --> 30:09.099
I'll assemble
my team.

30:12.853 --> 30:14.605
So, I'm out
of here when?

30:15.898 --> 30:17.733
We will have plenty
of time to talk about that.

30:17.816 --> 30:20.444
Yeah, but you just said that
everything was gonna be fixed.

30:20.528 --> 30:21.570
Look,

30:21.654 --> 30:22.738
what we've done
is we've figured out

30:22.821 --> 30:24.448
where that terrible
pressure is coming from.

30:24.532 --> 30:26.033
Now, we have to address

30:26.116 --> 30:28.285
why you were responding to it
the way you were.

30:28.369 --> 30:31.247
I was just relieving the pressure
in my chest. I mean...

30:31.330 --> 30:33.916
Trent, sticking
needles in your chest,

30:33.999 --> 30:36.335
physiologically,
had absolutely nothing to do

30:36.418 --> 30:38.587
with relieving
that pain.

30:38.671 --> 30:40.089
You're a human being, okay?

30:40.172 --> 30:41.549
You're gonna have
stressors in your life.

30:41.632 --> 30:43.050
We just gotta
figure out a way

30:43.133 --> 30:44.593
for you to deal
with that anxiety

30:44.677 --> 30:46.470
in a way that's
less self–destructive.

Gonna take
a little time.

sound crazy,

bone marrow in the past?

- Ma'am, it's police business.

34:38.619 --> 34:41.789
- Just a minute of your time.
- You said you found Dr. Marcel's DNA

34:41.872 --> 34:43.499
at a murder scene
seven years ago.

34:43.582 --> 34:46.168
His medical records show
that he donated bone marrow,

34:46.251 --> 34:48.754
and he donated it
before the murder occurred.
