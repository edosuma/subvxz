WEBVTT

00:33.950 --> 00:35.827
Thank God it's covered in warning labels

00:35.910 --> 00:38.163
because this antifreeze looks delicious!

00:38.246 --> 00:39.414
<i>Freeze!</i>

00:39.497 --> 00:41.166
Peggy, look.

00:42.584 --> 00:44.919
-Hank, we are not getting an HDTV.

00:45.003 --> 00:46.379
They are too lifelike.

00:46.463 --> 00:48.798
Luanne would be walking into it
all the time.

00:48.882 --> 00:51.676
No, it's Bobby, He's watching football.

00:51.760 --> 00:53.344
<i>Like Batarinsky's in now...</i>

00:53.428 --> 00:55.305
He's too close to the screen.

00:55.388 --> 00:57.057
-Should I go...
No! Don't disturb him.

00:58.308 --> 01:01.186
<i>...across the line!
They got the first down there!</i>

01:01.978 --> 01:04.147
First, I thought Bobby was just standing

01:04.230 --> 01:06.649
in front of the TV
watching all the colors.

01:06.733 --> 01:08.777
-But then, he actually cheered.

01:09.694 --> 01:13.656
Congratulations, Hank.
Now your life is finally perfect.

01:13.740 --> 01:16.659
You guys should come over
and watch the Cowboy game tomorrow.

01:16.743 --> 01:18.787
I have to capitalize on this.

01:18.870 --> 01:22.999
Otherwise, we'll be right back to watching
his troll doll performances.

01:23.083 --> 01:25.794
Yeah, man. Talking about that ol' dang ol'
"Trolleo and Juliet," man.

01:25.877 --> 01:27.754
That ol', that's dang ol' awful, man.

01:30.965 --> 01:33.343
Well, that was a great play,
wasn't it, son?

01:33.426 --> 01:35.178
Don't you think it was great?

01:35.261 --> 01:38.223
Don't you just wanna
watch football forever?

01:38.306 --> 01:41.434
-Be cool, Hank.
-I'm cool. I'm cool.

01:41.518 --> 01:43.103
Yeah, it was great.

01:43.186 --> 01:45.772
Mister Dauterive,
will you pass me the chips?

01:45.855 --> 01:48.066
Goddangit, Bill! Pass him the chips!

01:49.192 --> 01:51.236
The bowl! It's empty! We're out!

01:51.319 --> 01:55.448
That's okay. That's okay. We'll just go
to the kitchen and get more chips.

01:55.532 --> 01:58.451
Bobby, you stay right here
and watch that game,

01:58.993 --> 02:00.787
which you are enjoying.

02:06.084 --> 02:07.544
Well, he seems interested.

02:07.627 --> 02:11.464
We got to close the deal and get this kid
to a real game quick!

02:11.548 --> 02:14.300
Yeah, man. We got a dang ol'
Big Twelve championship

02:14.384 --> 02:16.010
over in Houston this year, man.

02:16.094 --> 02:18.179
Texas-Nebraska, that's perfect!

02:18.263 --> 02:22.809
A big game, a trip to the Rose Bowl
at stake, an intense rivalry.

02:22.892 --> 02:27.188
Bobby will get a real sense of hatred
that makes football so great.

02:33.069 --> 02:37.699
Son, remember the day you found out
cakes could be made of ice cream?

02:37.782 --> 02:39.659
Well, today is gonna be better.

02:39.742 --> 02:40.910
Wow.

02:40.994 --> 02:43.204
This is gonna be some day.

02:44.080 --> 02:46.541
Hank, I have mapped out
a route to the game

02:46.624 --> 02:49.252
that is the least likely
to distract Bobby.

02:49.335 --> 02:52.547
There are no amusement parks,
malls, or magic shops.

02:52.630 --> 02:55.008
If I missed something, use this.

02:55.091 --> 02:56.885
It only buys you three minutes.

02:56.968 --> 02:58.219
So use it carefully.

02:58.303 --> 02:59.137
Uncle Hank!

02:59.220 --> 03:02.390
Uncle Hank! I made you
a mix tape for the drive.

03:02.473 --> 03:07.395
Do not accidentally play side B
or you will fall in love.

03:14.652 --> 03:15.820
Here we are, Bobby.

03:17.071 --> 03:18.740
Alamo Field.

03:18.823 --> 03:21.868
So this is football.

03:24.120 --> 03:25.830
Twenty-five dollars?

03:25.914 --> 03:27.498
Where's the regular parking?

03:27.582 --> 03:31.920
There is none because everyone
is a V.I.P. at Alamo Field.

03:40.345 --> 03:43.056
Wow. Look at all that cool stuff.

03:43.139 --> 03:46.226
Hey, you want you some souvenirs?
Let's get you some souvenirs.

03:46.309 --> 03:49.604
We can redo your whole room
in Longhorns, if you want.

03:49.687 --> 03:51.731
Oh, wastebaskets.

03:53.274 --> 03:58.446
-Dale, you got the tickets?
-Yup. One for you, you, and you.

03:59.155 --> 04:04.035
"Texas versus Nebrasky"? Dale, you idiot!
You bought fake tickets.

04:04.118 --> 04:05.828
Impossible.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.207
Well played, Octavio.

04:09.290 --> 04:10.500
What are we gonna do?

04:10.583 --> 04:12.794
Man, we're gonna have to go
to dang ol' scalper, man.

04:12.877 --> 04:14.003
Scalper?

04:14.087 --> 04:15.797
Boomhauer, that's illegal.

04:19.926 --> 04:22.178
I'll get the tickets.

04:22.262 --> 04:27.016
Hi. My son just started liking football.

04:27.100 --> 04:30.103
And I really need him
to see this game in person.

04:30.186 --> 04:34.649
You see, he normally likes troll dolls
and things that fly around...

04:34.732 --> 04:36.651
Tickets are face value plus a hundred.

04:36.734 --> 04:38.820
A hundred?

04:41.281 --> 04:42.115
Uh...

04:42.198 --> 04:45.618
Thanks for bringing me those tickets
I forgot, old friend.

04:45.702 --> 04:50.999
I'm glad I was able to repay you the money
I owed you for an unrelated matter.

04:53.501 --> 04:56.504
Aunt Peggy, why aren't you going
to the game thing?

04:57.088 --> 04:59.841
Let's just say that my style of cheering

04:59.924 --> 05:03.511
is not consistent with
the new stadium regulations.

05:03.594 --> 05:05.513
You call that a coin toss?

05:08.349 --> 05:10.101
Ugh! I'm dizzy!

05:10.184 --> 05:13.313
We're so high up
because of those darn luxury boxes.

05:14.022 --> 05:17.483
They're ruining football
and possibly baseball too.

05:17.567 --> 05:18.860
But it's harder to tell.

05:19.444 --> 05:21.821
Look. That box is empty.

05:21.904 --> 05:24.282
What a waste! A real fan could be
sitting in there.

05:26.576 --> 05:27.869
That blimp scared me.

05:27.952 --> 05:32.540
Dad, the birds flying below us
are blocking my view of the game.

05:32.623 --> 05:36.336
Do you think if I threw some popcorn
over there, they'd get out of the way?

05:36.419 --> 05:38.629
Bill, throw you popcorn at the birds.

05:38.713 --> 05:41.215
But it was 12 dollars...

05:47.013 --> 05:48.348
Dad, I'm kind of thirsty.

05:48.431 --> 05:49.891
Can I go get a soda?

05:49.974 --> 05:52.977
Sure. Nothing like a cold drink
at a great game.

05:53.061 --> 05:54.020
Here's a 10.

05:54.937 --> 05:56.314
Better make that 20.

05:59.108 --> 06:03.154
The concession stand can make Bobby
like football so much.

06:03.237 --> 06:05.406
The Longhorns have to do their part.

06:05.490 --> 06:07.241
God, they can't even tackle!

06:08.034 --> 06:09.952
They can't even move the ball.

06:11.162 --> 06:12.830
They can't even punt.

06:13.915 --> 06:16.709
Well, I'm sure glad
Bobby's not here to see this.

06:16.793 --> 06:17.960
Yeah.

06:18.044 --> 06:23.383
Uh, wait. Does Bobby know
an oil tycoon or a Saudi prince?

06:23.466 --> 06:25.927
Because he's sitting in a luxury box.

06:26.010 --> 06:26.844
What?

06:30.348 --> 06:31.432
Bobby?

06:39.649 --> 06:42.110
-Bobby?
-Hey, Dad. Check this out.

06:42.193 --> 06:45.988
I can watch the game and support my lumbar
at the same time.

06:46.072 --> 06:48.616
Bobby, what are you doing?
You can't be in here.

06:48.699 --> 06:50.993
But you said real fans
could be sitting here.

06:51.077 --> 06:52.620
And then I realized something.

06:52.703 --> 06:54.163
I'm a real fan.

06:54.247 --> 06:56.582
Check out how close we are to the field!

06:57.750 --> 06:59.293
You can smell the grass.

06:59.377 --> 07:02.422
The ref just threw
some kind of hankie thing,

07:02.505 --> 07:06.509
and Nebraska had to move back
four or five lines.

07:07.176 --> 07:10.304
Look, Bobby. I know it's nice.
But we can't stay here.

07:10.388 --> 07:11.472
We have to go...

07:11.556 --> 07:12.598
Interception!

07:13.933 --> 07:17.061
These boxes are very expensive, Bobby.

07:17.145 --> 07:18.688
Yeah, look at him run!

07:18.771 --> 07:20.189
Run!

07:20.273 --> 07:21.732
Yeah, right!

07:23.276 --> 07:27.113
Well, I guess we have to go now.

07:27.196 --> 07:29.157
Yes. Yes, we, we should go.

07:29.907 --> 07:31.367
Go, Horns, go!

07:31.451 --> 07:32.952
Go, Horns, go!

07:33.035 --> 07:34.579
Go, Horns, go!

07:34.662 --> 07:36.330
Go, Horns, go!

07:40.168 --> 07:41.919
Go, Horns, go!

07:42.003 --> 07:43.671
Go, Horns, go!

07:43.754 --> 07:45.298
Go, Horns, go!

07:49.135 --> 07:50.678
Maybe we should leave.

07:51.637 --> 07:53.723
All right! Another first down!

07:55.475 --> 07:56.809
Maybe we shouldn't leave.

07:56.893 --> 07:58.728
The Longhorns were doing terrible.

07:58.811 --> 08:01.230
And the momentum shifted right
when we got here.

08:01.314 --> 08:03.399
We've got mojo on our side now.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.193
What's mojo?

08:05.276 --> 08:08.237
Mojo is a magical, fragile thing.

08:08.321 --> 08:10.740
It's when you've pleased
the God of football,

08:10.823 --> 08:14.494
and he decides to shine his glorious
bounty upon your team.

08:14.577 --> 08:16.204
If you anger him, he takes it away.

08:16.287 --> 08:17.663
We got the mojo!

08:17.747 --> 08:20.333
The Longhorns have to win!
Oh, they have to!

08:20.416 --> 08:22.543
Oh, I hope with all my hope!

08:22.627 --> 08:25.046
Me too, Bobby. Me too.

08:25.671 --> 08:26.631
Hank!

08:26.714 --> 08:28.007
We were worried sick!

08:28.090 --> 08:29.509
And our seats were awful.

08:29.592 --> 08:30.468
Wow.

08:30.551 --> 08:32.678
This place is fancy.

08:34.680 --> 08:35.890
Free beer.

08:35.973 --> 08:37.016
Free hot dogs!

08:37.934 --> 08:39.143
Free drawer space!

08:39.227 --> 08:41.062
Hey, throw me the ball!

08:41.145 --> 08:42.813
Hey, throw me the ball!

08:42.897 --> 08:44.440
Dangit, Dale. Knock it off.

08:44.524 --> 08:47.944
If you guys keep acting like jackasses,
we'll get kicked out of here.

08:48.027 --> 08:49.153
And if we get kicked out,

08:49.237 --> 08:52.323
the momentum might shift back
to Nebraska and then we lose.

08:52.406 --> 08:56.702
And if we lose, Bobby'll hate football
and live an unfulfilling life.

08:56.786 --> 08:58.246
And then he will die.

08:59.080 --> 09:00.122
Man, Hank!

09:00.206 --> 09:01.916
You've really thought this through.

09:06.337 --> 09:08.047
<i>Hold onto your hats, folks.</i>

09:08.130 --> 09:10.758
<i>The Longhorns are driving down the field!</i>

09:10.841 --> 09:12.093
-Yeah, man!
-Whoa!

09:12.593 --> 09:15.930
I'm gonna watch the game unencumbered.

09:16.013 --> 09:18.224
So long, jerk!

09:19.850 --> 09:20.851
Dessert cart!

09:24.355 --> 09:28.693
Uh, is Jake Middleton here?
This is supposed to be his box.

09:28.776 --> 09:29.777
Jake Middleton?

09:29.860 --> 09:31.195
The old Nebraska quarterback?

09:31.279 --> 09:33.739
One of the greatest playmakers
in the history of the game?

09:33.823 --> 09:35.283
Is this his box?

09:36.117 --> 09:37.034
Yeah.

09:37.785 --> 09:39.787
Yup, he's here. Hold on.

09:42.623 --> 09:44.041
We're his family.

09:44.125 --> 09:47.086
Ned Middleton. Pleased
to make your acquaintanceship.

09:47.169 --> 09:49.672
Why are you wearing Texas clothes?

09:51.465 --> 09:52.466
Irony.

09:52.550 --> 09:56.387
Oh, Jake's out there with a kid
from the Make a Wish Foundation.

09:56.470 --> 09:59.765
And it's that kid's wish
that they not be disturbed.

09:59.849 --> 10:04.520
Oh, and it was also his wish that we eat
all the desserts and you bill it to Jake.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.856
So leave the cart and be on your way.

10:10.818 --> 10:13.029
<i>Wrap him up, college boy!</i>

10:13.112 --> 10:15.865
Come on! Do I need
to show you how to tackle?

10:15.948 --> 10:16.949
Huh? Huh?

10:22.705 --> 10:26.375
I think they should fake like
they're gonna give it to the guy who runs,

10:26.459 --> 10:29.545
but instead throw it
to the guy who catches.

10:29.629 --> 10:32.173
That's a play-action pass
to the tight end.

10:32.256 --> 10:34.425
Bobby, you just earned yourself a beer.

10:34.508 --> 10:38.679
Now, I can't let you drink it.
But you can savor the aroma of mine.

10:40.681 --> 10:42.183
Touchdown!

10:42.266 --> 10:44.101
No, no. No, no, you can't stop smelling.

10:44.185 --> 10:47.605
When I touched your shoulder and you
sniffed the beer, Texas took the lead.

10:47.688 --> 10:48.689
You're right.

10:48.773 --> 10:52.485
But you're gonna hold this beer
under my nose for the rest of the game?

10:52.568 --> 10:57.490
I once watched the entire second half
of a game with a roll of tape on my head.

10:57.573 --> 10:59.283
And that was just pre-season.

10:59.367 --> 11:02.703
This is for the Rose Bowl.

11:04.205 --> 11:06.165
Defense! Defense!

11:06.248 --> 11:08.417
Defense! Defense!

11:08.501 --> 11:10.127
Defense! Defense!

11:10.211 --> 11:12.254
This smells like sick.

11:12.338 --> 11:14.507
Just hold on for 10 more seconds.

11:15.216 --> 11:18.844
Down, set, hut!

11:23.015 --> 11:25.935
Whoa, Nelly! The Nebraska coach
is knocked out cold.

11:26.018 --> 11:29.188
Assistant Coach Will Benton
is gonna have to step up.

11:29.271 --> 11:31.232
Doesn't look like he's ready for the job.

11:31.315 --> 11:32.858
I think he's crying.

11:32.942 --> 11:35.986
If we hold them for one more down,
we're going to the championship.

11:38.906 --> 11:40.908
<i>And in comes Panama.</i>

11:40.991 --> 11:42.827
-<i>Panama...</i>
-This is interesting.

11:44.286 --> 11:45.621
-Hey, man. Not it, man.
-Not it!

11:45.705 --> 11:46.706
Not it!

11:46.789 --> 11:47.873
Too close to call.

11:49.667 --> 11:50.835
Fine, I'll do it.

11:50.918 --> 11:53.838
If things go south, I can always pretend
I'm a fax machine.

11:55.715 --> 11:56.716
Hello?

11:57.591 --> 11:59.009
Hold, please.

11:59.885 --> 12:01.929
Uh, Hank, you got a call.

12:02.012 --> 12:03.681
Who the heck is calling me here?

12:03.764 --> 12:06.183
It's the assistant Coach for Nebraska.

12:06.267 --> 12:08.769
-What?
-And you're Jake Middleton.

12:08.853 --> 12:10.855
This is luxury box. Good luck.

12:11.522 --> 12:12.398
Uh...

12:12.481 --> 12:14.150
-Hello?
-Oh, God. Jake!

12:14.233 --> 12:15.276
Jake, I need a play.

12:15.359 --> 12:18.112
I... I, I don't know what to do.
The fans will kill me.

12:18.195 --> 12:20.322
And they'll do it with tractors
and farm machinery.

12:20.406 --> 12:22.241
Uh, um...

12:22.324 --> 12:23.200
Give me a minute.

12:23.868 --> 12:26.829
Nebraska wants Jake Middleton
to call a play.

12:26.912 --> 12:27.955
Wingo!

12:28.038 --> 12:31.000
Just think of the dumbest play you can,
and the Longhorns win.

12:31.083 --> 12:33.461
Yeah! Do it, Hank.
Win it for the Longhorns!

12:33.544 --> 12:36.672
I can't give a fake play. It's dishonest.

12:36.756 --> 12:38.466
It might even be illegal.

12:38.549 --> 12:41.510
That's right. We could get in trouble.
Don't do it. It's wrong.

12:42.553 --> 12:46.098
Then again, I'm not sure
if helping Texas is ever wrong.

12:46.182 --> 12:48.392
It isn't! God bless Texas!

12:48.476 --> 12:50.936
Do you know how many laws
you've broken today

12:51.020 --> 12:53.481
trying to get your son to like football?

12:54.732 --> 12:56.066
Go, Horns, go!

12:56.150 --> 12:57.735
Go, Horns, go!

12:59.195 --> 13:01.489
Yes. This is Jake Middleton.

13:01.572 --> 13:05.075
Okay, here's what you, uh, we should do.

13:05.159 --> 13:07.745
Have the quarterback pitch the ball
to the halfback,

13:07.828 --> 13:09.997
who will quick kick it
to the coffin corner.

13:10.080 --> 13:12.583
A quick kick! But we'd just be
turning the ball over!

13:12.666 --> 13:17.797
Well, that's why it's a good play.
Texas will never be expecting it.

13:17.880 --> 13:19.548
Well, yeah! It's stupid.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.175
Hey, you called me.

13:21.258 --> 13:23.969
If you didn't want Jake Middleton
to give you the play,

13:24.053 --> 13:25.888
you shouldn't have called Jake Middleton.

13:25.971 --> 13:27.765
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

13:28.224 --> 13:29.183
It's done.

13:29.266 --> 13:31.060
Dad! They're setting up!

13:40.528 --> 13:42.154
Defense, defense...

13:45.241 --> 13:46.492
This is exciting!

13:46.575 --> 13:49.495
Hank, you should really
come in here and see this!

13:49.578 --> 13:50.913
<i>And it's desperation time...</i>

13:50.996 --> 13:52.998
Sixty-nine, sixty-nine. Hut! Hut!

13:53.082 --> 13:56.126
<i>Takes it left. A quick kick?</i>

13:56.210 --> 13:58.712
<i>The Longhorns look confused.
They scramble.</i>

13:58.796 --> 14:01.966
<i>All Texas has to do is let the ball roll
down, and it's lights out.</i>

14:02.049 --> 14:04.802
<i>Holy Moses! That's a live ball!</i>

14:04.885 --> 14:08.055
<i>Nebraska wins! Nebraska wins!</i>

14:10.891 --> 14:13.394
No!

14:15.062 --> 14:17.731
Dad, why did this happen?

14:25.739 --> 14:28.200
-Hank!
-Hello, Hank? Hank?

14:28.284 --> 14:30.870
Wha... What happened? We won, right?

14:30.953 --> 14:33.414
We're going to the Rose Bowl, right?
We cheered.

14:33.497 --> 14:35.583
Snap out of it! We lost!

14:35.666 --> 14:36.750
Well, you lost.

14:36.834 --> 14:37.877
Oh, no!

14:40.671 --> 14:42.172
We were so close.

14:42.256 --> 14:46.051
Is it okay that I feel like
I don't want to live anymore?

14:46.135 --> 14:47.803
Yes, Bobby. That's normal.

14:52.892 --> 14:55.561
Why? Why, why me?

14:55.644 --> 14:58.022
Why? I am a good person!

14:58.105 --> 15:01.901
When charities send me free address
labels, I don't use them!

15:01.984 --> 15:06.906
Why...

15:12.244 --> 15:13.704
Coach, congratulations.

15:13.787 --> 15:16.165
That quick kick was a stroke of genius.

15:16.248 --> 15:18.834
Well, I have to give credit
to Jake Middleton.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.419
The man who called that play.

15:20.502 --> 15:22.671
What? I didn't call any play.

15:22.755 --> 15:24.673
My plane was late. I just got here.

15:24.757 --> 15:26.842
Really? Well, no wonder
it didn't make any sense.

15:26.926 --> 15:29.303
Well, whoever it was in that box
won the game for Nebraska.

15:30.596 --> 15:32.056
Oh, my God!

15:37.102 --> 15:39.313
Okay, they just caught a glimpse of me.

15:39.396 --> 15:41.982
They can't identify you
if they just catch a glimpse.

15:42.066 --> 15:43.776
Bigfoot, Loch Ness monster...

15:43.859 --> 15:44.860
Jack Ruby!

15:44.944 --> 15:46.612
Caught and stuffed, every one!

15:46.695 --> 15:49.323
When all those Texas fans finds us,
they're gonna tear us

15:49.406 --> 15:51.408
limb from limb, from limb!

15:51.492 --> 15:53.410
We gotta get out of here fast.

15:53.494 --> 15:55.621
But we can't let Bobby know
what's going on.

15:55.704 --> 15:59.416
Seeing us get our asses kicked
will turn Bobby off football forever.

15:59.500 --> 16:03.963
I found some more of the mini eclairs,
so I'm starting to settle down.

16:04.672 --> 16:06.674
What's everybody doing on the ground?

16:06.757 --> 16:10.886
Uh, it's a tradition.
We're pretending we're Longhorns.

16:10.970 --> 16:13.973
You know, grazing
after a hard-fought game.

16:14.765 --> 16:16.350
-Moo!
-Moo!

16:16.433 --> 16:17.977
That sounds like fun.

16:19.311 --> 16:21.146
Moo!

16:22.731 --> 16:27.319
After the graze, we do what is called
a Longhorn stampede.

16:27.403 --> 16:31.573
We race out of the stadium to the car
as fast as we can.

16:31.657 --> 16:34.159
Okay? Ready, set, stampede.

16:35.619 --> 16:38.455
Wait. I don't have my belt, or my shoes...
Don't leave me!

16:39.581 --> 16:42.292
All we have to do is get down the elevator
and then we'll...

16:42.376 --> 16:43.877
No, no! it's our waiter!

16:44.712 --> 16:47.464
I totally could identify the guy
that called the play.

16:47.548 --> 16:49.091
Not that anyone's asking me.

16:52.886 --> 16:54.096
Quick! This way!

17:13.198 --> 17:15.367
We made it! We're free!

17:24.710 --> 17:27.671
-...hurt somebody!
-They're wrong! Violence is the answer!

17:27.755 --> 17:29.465
We're in the lion's den, Hank.

17:29.548 --> 17:31.008
I must tell you there's a good chance

17:31.091 --> 17:33.385
I will betray you
before the day is through.

17:35.596 --> 17:39.349
Let's just stay together and make our way
to the van quietly.

17:39.433 --> 17:41.727
I'd feel safer if my pants could stay up.

17:47.357 --> 17:50.235
I heard that guy who called that play
was a Nebraska fan

17:50.319 --> 17:52.946
who kidnapped a Texas fan
and stole his jersey.

17:53.030 --> 17:55.741
I heard they raised
a Nebraska baby in Texas,

17:55.824 --> 17:57.910
so it could move
between groups undetected.

17:57.993 --> 18:01.205
He was wearing one
of those old school jerseys...

18:01.288 --> 18:02.331
Like that one!

18:02.414 --> 18:03.582
Oh, Lord!

18:04.750 --> 18:07.753
-Get him!
-Yeah, man!

18:10.589 --> 18:13.342
Dad, what are they doing to that guy?

18:13.425 --> 18:15.469
Uh, it's another tradition, Bobby.

18:15.552 --> 18:18.680
A little post-game roughhousing
like puppies do.

18:19.598 --> 18:22.101
Yup. There's the biting.

18:22.184 --> 18:25.437
Hey, man. You gotta dang, like,
take off that dang ol' jersey, man.

18:31.443 --> 18:34.196
But, Dad, these are Nebraska T-shirts.

18:34.279 --> 18:37.491
Well, that's right, Bobby.
That's what football is all about.

18:38.408 --> 18:39.701
Sportsmanship.

18:39.785 --> 18:41.662
That's a sign of goodwill.

18:41.745 --> 18:43.163
Yay, Huskers.

18:50.671 --> 18:52.005
Get in! Get in! Get in!

18:52.089 --> 18:53.215
Let's get out of here!

19:00.180 --> 19:01.598
S'go! S'go!

19:01.682 --> 19:04.768
S'go!

19:06.061 --> 19:07.354
Hey, someone's leaving.

19:15.779 --> 19:17.114
All right, here we go.

19:19.700 --> 19:22.202
Okay, the baby's in. Time to go.

19:25.038 --> 19:26.874
And now we go!

19:29.543 --> 19:32.796
Would you just get
in the goddang car and move?

19:33.755 --> 19:34.798
Are you talking to me?

19:34.882 --> 19:37.759
Yeas, we're talking to you.
You're the one blocking the street.

19:37.843 --> 19:41.430
Come on, move! We don't take that
from a Nebraska fan!

19:41.513 --> 19:44.099
It can get all kind of crazy up
in here if you want!

19:58.530 --> 20:00.240
There's an opening! Go! Go!

20:02.701 --> 20:03.911
No one's letting me in!

20:03.994 --> 20:06.663
What are we gonna do?

20:10.751 --> 20:12.669
Come on, buddy. Join the convoy.

20:14.004 --> 20:15.714
Just go, Dale.

20:21.178 --> 20:22.721
Sorry about the game, Bobby.

20:22.804 --> 20:25.057
All football games aren't like that.

20:25.140 --> 20:27.851
-They're not?
-No. I promise they're not.

20:27.935 --> 20:29.478
That's too bad.

20:29.561 --> 20:31.021
But some are, right?

20:31.104 --> 20:33.357
All the running and yelling and stuff?

20:33.440 --> 20:35.359
And we can go again, can't we?

20:36.610 --> 20:38.028
We sure can!

20:38.111 --> 20:40.614
The Longhorns may not be
going to the Rose Bowl.

20:40.697 --> 20:43.700
But they might go to the Gator Bowl,
or the Peach Bowl,

20:43.784 --> 20:47.204
or, heaven forbid,
the Pacific Life Holiday Bowl.

20:49.957 --> 20:51.667
If we're going all the way
to Nebraska,

20:51.750 --> 20:53.001
I'm gonna need a pit stop.

20:58.715 --> 20:59.633
Excuse me.

20:59.716 --> 21:01.468
We're looking to buy a new TV.

21:01.551 --> 21:03.136
Our old one gave out.

21:04.221 --> 21:08.058
Here, kitty kitty. Come here, kitty!

21:08.141 --> 21:11.853
Do you mind if I open this window
and let this kitty in?

21:13.063 --> 21:15.732
And I think we need one
with a little less definition.

21:54.354 --> 21:56.940
-<i>Wrap him up, college boy!</i>
