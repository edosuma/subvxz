WEBVTT

00:07.416 --> 00:10.127
What do you say we head out
tonight after school?

00:10.741 --> 00:12.887
Hit the town,
maybe get into a little trouble?

00:12.955 --> 00:14.856
Yeah, maybe
in my next life, crazy.

00:14.924 --> 00:16.921
Ah! Maybe
you already got plans!

00:17.041 --> 00:19.760
- Maybe a secret girlfriend.
- Ah, please!

00:19.828 --> 00:22.195
I have to have a social life
to have a girlfriend.

00:22.263 --> 00:23.208
I mean, you know my father:

00:23.328 --> 00:25.125
I can barely go to the bathroom
without his approval.

00:25.642 --> 00:27.510
Well, he doesn't keep tabs
on you every second.

00:27.577 --> 00:29.678
I bet you are the most popular
guy on campus, right?

00:29.746 --> 00:32.847
- Whatever!
- Ha! Ha! I knew it!

00:32.915 --> 00:35.750
So what's her name?

00:43.759 --> 00:47.627
Stay put.

00:49.000 --> 00:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:56.536 --> 00:59.872
- Yes, I'm being serious!
- It's just that you caught me by surprise.

00:59.939 --> 01:02.507
- What? You don't think I'd make a good supervisor?
- You'd make a great supervisor!

01:02.575 --> 01:04.275
I just didn't think you'd be
interested in upper management,

01:04.343 --> 01:06.144
that's all. Why now?

01:06.211 --> 01:08.179
Well, I mean,
you're off fighting crime

01:08.247 --> 01:11.249
and keeping our streets clean with the IIB.
Now, Sandy's in the jungle,

01:11.317 --> 01:14.252
curing exotic diseases.
I'm spinning my wheels!

01:14.320 --> 01:16.154
It's time for a change.

01:16.221 --> 01:18.256
You've thought about this, huh?

01:18.323 --> 01:21.258
Yes. I mean,
if not now, when? You know,

01:21.326 --> 01:23.794
even Peter Pan had to grow up...
into Robin Williams, no less.

01:23.861 --> 01:26.797
- You watched <i>Hook again last night.
- Twice.</i>

01:26.864 --> 01:28.732
Yeah. It's you, huh?

01:28.800 --> 01:30.668
Yeah. I guess I'm not done
saving lives yet, partner.

01:30.735 --> 01:32.670
Hey.

01:36.607 --> 01:39.475
Hey, Michelle! What's up?

01:39.543 --> 01:41.778
All right!
I'll be right there.

02:07.536 --> 02:09.603
That was fast, man. I can't
believe you beat us here.

02:09.670 --> 02:11.605
Well, I ran a few red lights.
So what's going on?

02:11.673 --> 02:13.607
Town car spun out;
driver was found unconscious;

02:13.675 --> 02:15.543
single gunshot wound
to the chest.

02:15.610 --> 02:17.611
That's all we know so far.

02:17.679 --> 02:20.781
- So why is this on IIB's radar?
- Well, Metro ran the plates.

02:20.850 --> 02:24.151
Turns out the car's registered
to Abbassi Ayim.

02:24.219 --> 02:26.820
Ayim? Why do I know that?

02:26.888 --> 02:28.788
The former Liberian
Minister of State,

02:28.857 --> 02:31.225
accused of theft and brutality.
He relocated here years ago

02:31.292 --> 02:33.193
after being forced
to be removed from office.

02:33.261 --> 02:35.162
That's right! There was
quite the public outcry.

02:35.230 --> 02:37.231
Yeah, some folks
aren't too happy

02:37.298 --> 02:39.298
about an exiled tyrant
living in their neighborhood.

02:39.366 --> 02:40.900
Well, a guy like that, his
name's flagged in the system.

02:40.968 --> 02:44.170
Is that the victim?

02:44.238 --> 02:47.806
- Paramedics are working on him now.
- Thank you. Hey!

02:47.875 --> 02:49.842
Long time no see!

02:49.910 --> 02:52.111
Hey! Told you you couldn't
quit me. Nice badge.

02:55.714 --> 02:58.583
Please, please!

02:58.650 --> 03:01.898
Where is he? Is he OK?

03:01.998 --> 03:03.766
Sir, you've lost
a lot of blood, OK?

03:03.834 --> 03:05.535
You need to take it easy. We're
going to get you out of here.

03:05.602 --> 03:08.070
All right? Just breathe,
just breathe, sir.

03:08.138 --> 03:10.072
- Where is he?
- Just breathe.

03:16.979 --> 03:19.314
- There was a boy
in the back of the car:

03:19.382 --> 03:22.150
- 15, maybe 16 years old.
- That explains this.

03:26.256 --> 03:29.701
Ibrahim Ayim.
It's Abbassi Ayim's son.

03:30.929 --> 03:33.527
So, the question is,
did he walk away?

03:33.647 --> 03:35.229
...or was he taken?

03:36.182 --> 03:42.023
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

03:47.703 --> 03:49.963
- So what's the protocol here?
- Well, until evidence

03:50.083 --> 03:52.227
tells us otherwise,
we treat this as an abduction.

03:52.294 --> 03:55.815
So they found a gun registered
to the driver, Quazy Hanson,

03:55.915 --> 03:59.310
30 years of age. He's part of
Ayim's personal security detail.

03:59.430 --> 04:01.386
The clip was full:
he didn't get a shot off.

04:01.454 --> 04:02.784
What about Ayim's son?

04:02.904 --> 04:05.556
Ibrahim Ayim:
he was born in Liberia,

04:05.624 --> 04:08.492
moved here eight years ago
with his father. No siblings.

04:08.560 --> 04:11.395
- Has he been in any trouble?
- No juvenile record.

04:11.463 --> 04:13.464
He's registered to a private
school in Richmond Hill.

04:13.532 --> 04:15.866
I confirmed that he didn't make
it to class this morning.

04:15.933 --> 04:17.934
I'll head over there and talk
to his teachers and his friends.

04:18.002 --> 04:20.637
How about the driver?
Does he have a record?

04:20.704 --> 04:22.873
He's been in the employ for
the past four years. No record.

04:22.940 --> 04:24.875
Well, Ayim has more enemies

04:24.942 --> 04:27.010
than my mother
has decorative spoons, so...

04:27.078 --> 04:29.412
Why all the haters?

04:29.480 --> 04:31.981
He is suspected of stealing
millions from his own people.

04:32.049 --> 04:33.983
Not to mention
the rumours of brutality,

04:34.051 --> 04:35.918
torture, mass murder...

04:35.986 --> 04:37.953
They didn't have
enough proof to lock him away,

04:38.021 --> 04:39.922
so they exiled his ass.

04:39.990 --> 04:42.392
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

04:42.459 --> 04:44.394
- Yeah?
- I got your message.

04:44.461 --> 04:46.395
- Has Ayim been notified yet?
- Yeah, Metro's on their way.

04:46.462 --> 04:50.432
OK, well tell them
to hold off until I get there.

04:50.500 --> 04:52.967
I want to handle
the relationship personally.

04:53.035 --> 04:55.837
Alpha dog to alpha dog, nice!
He's all yours, Fido.

04:58.241 --> 05:00.141
I need you working on a list
of possible kidnappers.

05:00.210 --> 05:02.176
There's no way
that this was random.

05:02.244 --> 05:04.212
[It'll be connected somehow
to Ayim with the kid.]

05:04.279 --> 05:06.280
Leave no stone unturned, OK?

05:06.348 --> 05:09.383
Spoken like a true tyrant.
Ayim would be proud.

05:09.451 --> 05:12.386
It's good to be king.

05:29.670 --> 05:31.638
IIB.

05:31.706 --> 05:33.772
- Where's your boss?
- Unavailable.

05:33.840 --> 05:35.941
You have to make an appointment.

05:36.008 --> 05:37.909
We need to see him now.
Is he here?

05:37.977 --> 05:40.145
It's fine, Rafiq.

05:40.213 --> 05:42.548
How may I help you gentlemen?

05:42.616 --> 05:45.183
Mr Ayim, my name is Alvin
Klein. I head up a special unit

05:45.252 --> 05:47.486
of the Integrative
Investigative Bureau.

05:47.554 --> 05:50.221
I am familiar
with the IIB, Mr Klein.

05:50.289 --> 05:53.124
- I assume this is not a social call.
- Is Ibrahim here?

05:53.191 --> 05:56.327
He left for school.
Why do you ask?

05:56.395 --> 06:00.097
Sir, your town car was
intercepted this morning.

06:00.165 --> 06:02.300
We have reason to believe
that your son has been abducted.

06:02.368 --> 06:05.402
With your permission, we'd like
to set up a command post

06:05.470 --> 06:07.971
here at the house in preparation
for any possible contact,

06:08.038 --> 06:11.808
- such as a ransom demand.
- Of course.

06:11.876 --> 06:13.843
Sir, these first hours
are the most crucial.

06:13.911 --> 06:15.979
If you have any idea
who might be responsible--

06:16.046 --> 06:18.749
- I have many enemies.
- Any of them stand out to you?

06:18.816 --> 06:22.050
A recent conflict, perhaps?

06:22.118 --> 06:24.353
There is someone.

06:24.421 --> 06:27.022
Dennis Harwell
long-time political activist.

06:27.090 --> 06:29.759
Guess who his favourite
punching bag is?

06:29.826 --> 06:31.761
- Abbassi Ayim?
- The one and only!

06:31.828 --> 06:33.763
Let's go have a chat
with Mr Harwell.

06:33.830 --> 06:35.765
- So, what's this guy up to?
- Well, he's hell-bent

06:35.832 --> 06:37.766
on getting Ayim
tossed out of the country.

06:37.833 --> 06:39.768
He's throwing around
some serious allegations

06:39.835 --> 06:41.770
with no proof
to back it up. Last week,

06:41.837 --> 06:44.238
Ayim's lawyer slapped him
with a cease-and-desist notice,

06:44.307 --> 06:46.207
which he didn't like so well.

06:46.275 --> 06:48.476
In his last column,
he declared all-out war on Ayim.

06:48.544 --> 06:50.545
Well, I would say
that kidnapping

06:50.613 --> 06:53.914
falls comfortably under warfare.
Klein's thoughts exactly.

06:53.981 --> 06:57.117
That's me. Hold on. Logan.

06:57.185 --> 06:59.119
[Hey! You want an update]

06:59.187 --> 07:01.121
[on your gunshot victim?]

07:01.189 --> 07:03.089
Yeah. Hey, thanks for calling
me back. How's he doing?

07:03.157 --> 07:04.991
Still in surgery;
bullet lodged between two ribs;

07:05.059 --> 07:06.827
shattered one
and collapsed one of his lungs.

07:06.894 --> 07:09.395
All right, so when
do we get to talk to him?

07:09.463 --> 07:11.096
[I can let you know
when he's in recovery,]

07:11.164 --> 07:13.032
but don't expect
any coherent conversations.

07:13.099 --> 07:15.034
- You got to keep me posted, OK?
- OK.

07:15.101 --> 07:17.837
- You coming?
- Yeah.

07:17.904 --> 07:19.872
Sir, can I talk
to you for a second?

07:19.940 --> 07:22.342
You know, I've got
a lot of paperwork, Mr Bey.

07:22.409 --> 07:25.211
Oh! Well, that's actually,
uh... kind of why I'm here.

07:25.278 --> 07:27.713
What did you do?

07:27.780 --> 07:30.649
Oh, no! Sir, it's nothing
like that. I just thought

07:30.717 --> 07:33.251
maybe I could, uh...

07:33.319 --> 07:36.087
help out a little bit
with some of the workload.

07:36.155 --> 07:39.391
- What are you talking about?
- Well, I think it's time for me

07:39.459 --> 07:41.392
to take my career
to the next level, sir.

07:41.460 --> 07:44.094
I'm ready to write
my supervisor exam.

07:47.566 --> 07:50.000
Supervisor exam.

07:50.068 --> 07:52.269
You're serious.

07:52.337 --> 07:55.406
Why does everybody
keep asking me that? Yes!

07:55.474 --> 07:57.241
Look, this isn't a good time:
I'm really swamped here,

07:57.308 --> 07:59.242
so could we just
talk about this later?

07:59.309 --> 08:01.778
Yeah, sure. OK.

08:01.846 --> 08:04.213
What are you still
doing here, Mr Bey?

08:17.226 --> 08:19.561
Since when is it a crime
to tell the truth?

08:19.629 --> 08:21.397
If you want an exact date,
check the top

08:21.464 --> 08:23.265
- of your cease-and-desist notice.
- I'm fighting that,

08:23.332 --> 08:26.034
but I can't afford to go up
against Ayim in court.

08:26.102 --> 08:28.570
Maybe you should've thought of that
before you declared a war on the guy.

08:28.638 --> 08:30.571
We organize public protests,

08:30.639 --> 08:33.541
peaceful protests, not snatching
kids off the street.

08:33.609 --> 08:36.277
I think you're forgetting
who the monster here is.

08:36.344 --> 08:38.245
Well, we've looked into
some of your peaceful protests.

08:38.313 --> 08:41.148
It's interesting how so many
of them have turned violent.

08:41.216 --> 08:43.418
I can't always control
what happens.

08:43.485 --> 08:45.519
There were three
in Liberia staged by you,

08:45.586 --> 08:47.721
all ending
in civilian casualties.

08:47.789 --> 08:49.656
Every time,
it was Ayim's forces

08:49.724 --> 08:52.191
- that instigated the violence.
- So why keep going back?

08:52.259 --> 08:55.595
The first time, sure:
you're making your statement.

08:55.663 --> 08:58.131
But every time after that, you're
just leading the lambs to slaughter.

08:58.198 --> 09:00.199
I have my reasons.

09:06.540 --> 09:09.775
And your reasons... are you
sure they're not personal?

09:09.843 --> 09:14.012
I never said
they weren't personal.

09:17.050 --> 09:19.016
- Where am I going?
- Right here.

09:19.084 --> 09:21.319
Thanks.

09:21.386 --> 09:24.823
Cory Draper? Hi.

09:24.890 --> 09:27.191
I'm Corporal Clarke
with the IIB.

09:27.259 --> 09:29.694
I just have a couple of
questions about Ibrahim Ayim.

09:29.762 --> 09:31.729
The principal tells me
that you two

09:31.797 --> 09:33.597
- are close friends.
- Is he OK?

09:33.665 --> 09:35.699
That's what we're trying
to find out.

09:35.767 --> 09:38.602
- Can you think of anyone who might want to hurt him?
- You know who his dad is,

09:38.670 --> 09:40.904
- right?
- Sure.

09:40.972 --> 09:44.040
Dude's all sorts of scary.
Even Abi's freaked out by him.

09:44.108 --> 09:46.677
- How so?
- Dude's got a temper.

09:46.744 --> 09:48.679
Ibrahim said he was scared

09:48.746 --> 09:50.580
his dad was going to kill him
when he got mad sometimes.

09:50.647 --> 09:52.815
Can you think of anyone else?

09:52.883 --> 09:56.352
Well, he did mention some guy
watching him at the school yard.

09:56.419 --> 09:58.554
He saw him there a few times,

09:58.622 --> 10:00.957
just watching.
And one time,

10:01.024 --> 10:03.125
Abi tries calling to him,
but the guy just took off.

10:03.193 --> 10:06.227
Did you get a description or did Ibrahim
happen to tell you what he looked like?

10:06.295 --> 10:09.263
- Just some black guy.
- OK.

10:09.331 --> 10:12.000
Thank you.
If Ibrahim contacts you

10:12.067 --> 10:14.002
or if you hear anything,
can you call me?

10:14.069 --> 10:16.437
Thanks.

10:18.440 --> 10:21.909
Wow! I guess
it's true what they say.

10:21.977 --> 10:25.613
If you say, "crime does pay",
I will shoot you.

10:25.680 --> 10:27.948
Getting good
at reading my mind.

10:38.158 --> 10:41.193
All right, thank you. Hey!

10:41.261 --> 10:43.129
How'd it go with Harwell?

10:43.196 --> 10:44.964
Well, he's certainly
got a bone to pick,

10:45.032 --> 10:47.033
but we didn't have enough
to bring him in,

10:47.100 --> 10:49.368
so Mitch is keeping
an eye on him.

10:49.436 --> 10:52.138
Our guy Ayim is definitely cooperating with
us, but I feel like he's holding back.

10:52.205 --> 10:54.372
I definitely want to know what's
going on inside his head, OK?

10:54.440 --> 10:56.875
Mr Ayim,
this is sergeant McCluskey

10:56.943 --> 10:58.777
and special consultant Logan.

10:58.845 --> 11:01.312
These are two
of my best investigators.

11:01.380 --> 11:04.049
Has there been any progress
made in my son's abduction?

11:04.116 --> 11:05.784
We're following
several leads, sir.

11:05.852 --> 11:07.719
I'm certain it's Harwell.

11:07.787 --> 11:09.587
The man threatened me
on a public forum.

11:09.655 --> 11:11.488
He's a parasite.
I want him arrested.

11:11.557 --> 11:14.091
Well, it's not quite
that simple, but I assure you,

11:14.159 --> 11:16.326
we're keeping him
under close surveillance.

11:16.394 --> 11:18.295
I know you've already
gone through this,

11:18.363 --> 11:20.130
but if you can think
of anyone else

11:20.198 --> 11:22.900
who'd want to harm you
or your son...

11:24.836 --> 11:27.136
As a former Minister of State,

11:27.204 --> 11:29.039
I am constantly dealing
with threats,

11:29.106 --> 11:31.274
both for myself and my family.

11:31.341 --> 11:33.342
I understand, sir,

11:33.410 --> 11:35.378
but if there's anything
you can tell us...

11:35.446 --> 11:39.015
Have you spoken to Ibrahim's
mother, Rita Bello?

11:39.083 --> 11:41.850
She showed up here two weeks
ago, raving like a lunatic.

11:41.918 --> 11:44.753
I had to remove her
from the property.

11:44.821 --> 11:46.822
That seems a bit harsh.

11:46.890 --> 11:49.925
She gave up her rights to Ibrahim a long time ago.
She has no business here.

11:49.993 --> 11:52.795
Can you think of why she would
want to take him from you now?

11:52.862 --> 11:55.831
You bastard!
You broke our agreement!

11:55.899 --> 11:59.266
Nothing comes to mind.

11:59.334 --> 12:01.669
- Yeah, we'll speak with her.
- Yeah.

12:06.875 --> 12:09.777
OK. Mr Ayim,
this could be it.

12:09.845 --> 12:13.680
OK, just like we discussed.
Here we go.

12:16.951 --> 12:18.852
- Yes?
- [Hello?]

12:18.920 --> 12:20.787
[Dad?]
Ibrahim!

12:20.855 --> 12:23.356
- Where are you?
- [Not sure. I--]

12:23.424 --> 12:25.225
[If you want
to see your son again,]

12:25.292 --> 12:27.027
[the price is
ten million dollars.]

12:27.095 --> 12:30.997
I will not pay you a cent!

12:31.064 --> 12:34.199
Do you hear me?
Not a damn cent!

12:34.267 --> 12:36.802
[You have eight hours
to deliver the cash.]

12:36.870 --> 12:39.905
[After that,
the boy dies.]

12:48.812 --> 12:50.881
Mr Ayim, I thought
we agreed that you'd try

12:51.001 --> 12:52.947
to keep them on the line
for as long as possible.

12:53.079 --> 12:55.047
I have no interest
in wasting time

12:55.114 --> 12:56.615
with scum like that.

12:56.735 --> 12:59.885
We can't effectively do our job, sir,
if you don't stick to the game plan.

12:59.952 --> 13:03.288
We got the trace, but the call
was made from a burner phone.

13:03.355 --> 13:06.390
They just texted the account that
they want the money be sent to.

13:06.457 --> 13:08.959
- Ten million's a big number.
- I've decided to pay.

13:09.027 --> 13:11.162
That's not the impression
you left on the phone, sir.

13:11.229 --> 13:14.431
I don't need you to understand
the way I do things, Mr. Klein.

13:14.499 --> 13:18.435
Well, I suggest we wait
until they call back.

13:18.503 --> 13:20.770
That way, we can insist
on a location drop,

13:20.838 --> 13:23.006
we'll flush them out
into the open.

13:23.074 --> 13:26.176
I strongly disagree. I suggest
we proceed as we discussed, sir.

13:26.243 --> 13:28.845
- The ransom will be paid.
- You have the cash?

13:28.913 --> 13:31.981
My accounts are offshore,
not easily accessible.

13:32.049 --> 13:34.584
But I can secure what I need
through private loans.

13:34.651 --> 13:36.618
I should have it in a few hours.

13:36.686 --> 13:38.921
The minute
they have that money,

13:38.988 --> 13:40.956
your son becomes a liability
to his abductors.

13:41.024 --> 13:43.491
The longer they have him,
the more danger he's in.

13:43.559 --> 13:46.929
I agree with Rafiq.
If I give them what they want,

13:46.996 --> 13:50.165
they'll have no reason
to harm him. They wouldn't dare.

13:50.233 --> 13:53.667
Well, I don't agree,
but it's your son.

13:53.736 --> 13:55.770
It's your call.

13:55.838 --> 13:58.472
We're going to need statements from your
security team and your household staff.

13:58.540 --> 14:01.042
- My staff? Why?
- We need to speak to everyone

14:01.110 --> 14:04.345
- who knew your driver's exact route and schedule.
- Of course.

14:04.412 --> 14:06.580
Rafiq will give you
what you need.

14:06.648 --> 14:09.950
Now, if you'll excuse me.

14:10.017 --> 14:12.619
I'll handle his staff.

14:12.686 --> 14:14.587
You two have bigger fish to fry.

14:14.655 --> 14:18.591
- Shall we?
- This way.

14:18.659 --> 14:20.627
Did you get anything?

14:20.694 --> 14:22.662
Like he said, he has a lot of
enemies. Reading him is like

14:22.730 --> 14:25.030
scrolling through a database of
possible suspects.

14:25.098 --> 14:27.166
- What about the mother?
- She was there,

14:27.234 --> 14:30.335
but there's more to it.
Ayim is hiding something.

14:33.306 --> 14:37.276
- Driver's in recovery.
- Let's go.

14:37.343 --> 14:39.678
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

14:39.746 --> 14:41.612
You're welcome.
I am very impressed!

14:41.680 --> 14:43.648
Becoming a supervisor's
a big commitment.

14:43.715 --> 14:45.616
It's nothing
I can't handle, right?

14:45.684 --> 14:47.752
...This is where you're
supposed to say, "Right, Oz!"

14:47.820 --> 14:50.655
Yes, of course! Why didn't you ask
Ryder to sign your application?

14:50.722 --> 14:52.623
I don't know.
He's been busy. Thanks again!

14:52.691 --> 14:54.725
All right!

14:57.262 --> 14:59.163
Hey, so the mystery man
in the school yard,

14:59.230 --> 15:01.131
- is he still a dead end?
- Yeah,

15:01.199 --> 15:03.533
Dev asked the students and
the teachers: nobody's seen him.

15:03.601 --> 15:05.602
- Hey!
- Hi!

15:05.670 --> 15:07.805
- So, can we see our guy?
- Yes, I will take you to him,

15:07.872 --> 15:09.773
but whatever your expectations
are, lower them.

15:09.841 --> 15:11.775
He's heavily sedated.

15:11.842 --> 15:13.776
Yeah, but is he
still conscious?

15:13.844 --> 15:16.078
He's in and out. But
even awake, I don't count on him

15:16.146 --> 15:18.047
being able to string
two sentences together.

15:18.115 --> 15:20.449
- I'm hoping he won't have to.
- OK.

15:23.187 --> 15:25.688
Make it quick, OK?
He needs his rest.

15:25.755 --> 15:29.958
Somebody should've
told him that.

15:32.995 --> 15:35.363
- Hey, no drive-through tonight: I want
to eat something healthy. - You got it!

15:35.431 --> 15:38.399
Whoa, hey! Hey, man!

15:38.467 --> 15:40.335
We already saved your life
once today, where are you going?

15:40.402 --> 15:42.871
I have to....

15:42.939 --> 15:45.172
...report to my boss.

15:45.240 --> 15:48.443
OK, you got a tough boss? Hey,
come on, I can relate to that.

15:48.510 --> 15:51.212
Come on, easy. Here we go, come
on. Come on. Here we go.

15:51.279 --> 15:54.048
I asked my boss for some career
guidance and he laughed in my face.

15:54.115 --> 15:57.552
Can you believe that, huh?
What is that, right?

15:57.619 --> 15:59.286
OK, OK.

15:59.355 --> 16:03.323
It's rumoured that my boss
once had a man executed

16:03.391 --> 16:05.726
for being late.

16:05.793 --> 16:07.828
...OK, you win.

16:13.267 --> 16:15.235
Thanks for bringing him back.

16:15.302 --> 16:17.102
Yeah. Maybe I'll come check in
with him after my shift.

16:17.170 --> 16:19.171
- Look at you.
- What?

16:19.239 --> 16:21.306
Not every paramedic
goes the extra mile.

16:21.375 --> 16:24.577
OK.

16:24.644 --> 16:26.879
Do you remember
anything that happened?

16:29.649 --> 16:31.784
It's... foggy.

16:31.852 --> 16:35.019
- I can't quite...
- It's OK. Just do your best.

16:35.087 --> 16:39.056
- OK.
- Just think.

16:46.098 --> 16:48.599
Ibrahim!

16:48.666 --> 16:52.068
I lost him.

16:52.136 --> 16:54.204
Can you think of anyone else
who could've done this?

16:54.272 --> 16:56.306
Anyone.

17:04.981 --> 17:07.983
He's gone.
It's my fault.

17:08.050 --> 17:10.319
- No, no, no. Calm down.
- That's enough.

17:10.387 --> 17:12.789
You're pushing him too hard.
I'm sorry.

17:12.856 --> 17:16.492
So are you sure it's the same
guy that you saw in Ayim's head?

17:16.560 --> 17:19.462
Yeah. He was wearing a work
shirt with the initials WASC.

17:19.530 --> 17:23.498
OK, well, I'll get Dev to do a
search of the local businesses.

17:30.172 --> 17:33.241
I'm sorry I can't be of more
help. I'm not in my son's life.

17:33.309 --> 17:35.577
You and Ayim never married,

17:35.645 --> 17:39.113
but you followed him to Canada shortly
after he brought Ibrahim here,

17:39.181 --> 17:41.249
so why come if not
to be closer to your son?

17:41.317 --> 17:44.819
- It's complicated.
- And you and Ayim,

17:44.886 --> 17:47.388
you have some sort
of arrangement.

17:47.456 --> 17:51.192
Yes, you might say
I was head hunted.

17:51.260 --> 17:53.593
Abbassi wanted a son

17:53.661 --> 17:55.963
and he had
very specific requirements

17:56.030 --> 17:58.665
- of the woman who would carry it for him.
- And you won the job.

17:58.732 --> 18:02.135
In exchange
for a generous monthly stipend

18:02.203 --> 18:04.137
to go away.

18:04.205 --> 18:07.007
But you didn't go away,
you followed.

18:07.075 --> 18:09.775
It looks that way, but no.

18:09.843 --> 18:13.579
I came here to make a good life

18:13.646 --> 18:16.515
and to make sure that Ayim
kept up his end of the bargain.

18:16.583 --> 18:19.018
That may seem cold to you,

18:19.086 --> 18:21.787
but I made my peace with
my decision a long time ago.

18:21.855 --> 18:23.856
We're not here to judge you.

18:23.923 --> 18:25.657
We're just curious, really,
why you'd go see Ayim now,

18:25.725 --> 18:27.659
after being away for so long.

18:27.727 --> 18:30.362
He told you.

18:30.429 --> 18:33.431
You bastard!

18:33.500 --> 18:36.401
Where is my money?
You owe me!

18:36.469 --> 18:38.504
He stopped paying you,
didn't he?

18:38.571 --> 18:41.473
Three months ago.
Won't even tell me why.

18:41.540 --> 18:43.941
I'm sure a lawyer
would be able to help.

18:44.009 --> 18:47.277
There's no paperwork.
He made me a promise,

18:47.345 --> 18:49.881
I accepted.
I was young and stupid.

18:49.948 --> 18:52.316
I suppose I should be thankful

18:52.384 --> 18:54.251
he's carried me
for this long, but...

18:54.319 --> 18:55.691
You want what
you were promised.

18:55.811 --> 18:57.357
You're damned right, I do.

18:57.477 --> 19:00.256
And I'm going to get it,
one way or another.

19:01.841 --> 19:03.860
We have reason to believe
that your son was being watched

19:03.928 --> 19:06.866
at his school by someone
he didn't know.

19:07.154 --> 19:08.431
Do you know anything
about that?

19:10.367 --> 19:12.602
Of course not.

19:12.670 --> 19:14.436
<i>Typical Abbassi, sending someone</i>

19:14.504 --> 19:17.039
<i>to keep tabs on his own son.</i>

19:18.641 --> 19:20.397
OK. Well, thank you for your time.

19:20.517 --> 19:22.488
We'll be in touch if you have
any more questions.

19:22.608 --> 19:24.112
- Thank you.
- Dev!

19:24.180 --> 19:26.314
Did you trace the initials?

19:50.638 --> 19:53.440
- We'd like to speak to the owner.
- Hamissi?

19:53.507 --> 19:56.977
I'm sorry, he's not here. 
<i>Not for a cop, anyway.</i>

19:59.313 --> 20:01.014
Do you mind
if we take a look around?

20:01.082 --> 20:04.690
Or we could come back with
a warrant and a dozen cops.

20:04.810 --> 20:05.985
Whatever works for you.

20:06.053 --> 20:07.920
Go ahead.

20:29.809 --> 20:32.611
- Keep watch here.
- All right.

21:06.076 --> 21:09.946
<i>That's it. Walk away.</i>

21:53.654 --> 21:55.521
Michelle!
He's going out the back!

22:27.452 --> 22:29.721
You must be Hamissi.

22:32.824 --> 22:34.758
Good work.

22:34.826 --> 22:36.927
- You OK?
- Yeah.

22:45.881 --> 22:48.582
What the hell is this?

22:48.650 --> 22:51.485
Oh, it's my supervisor application form.
Remember, we talked about it?

22:51.553 --> 22:55.000
- Well, I talked, you laughed.
- This isn't to be taken lightly, Oz.

22:55.120 --> 22:58.258
- Yeah, I know, sir.
- But you went behind my back anyway.

22:59.063 --> 23:02.000
What do you think? You fill out a form, take
a few classes, that's all there is to it?

23:02.120 --> 23:04.965
- Is that how you see my job?
Like anyone can do it? - No, sir. Not at all.

23:05.032 --> 23:07.851
This is an all-consuming job
and the training is grueling.

23:07.971 --> 23:09.727
You're gonna give up
your nights and your weekends?

23:09.795 --> 23:11.629
You're gonna hit the books
instead of the bars?

23:11.697 --> 23:13.464
Absolutely, sir. Yeah.

23:13.532 --> 23:15.466
- All right,
I'll make you a deal:

23:15.534 --> 23:18.603
if you feel this strongly
a couple months down the road,

23:18.671 --> 23:20.738
I'll get the ball rolling.
But until then,

23:20.806 --> 23:24.175
I'll hold on to this.

23:28.579 --> 23:31.615
- I have assembled the ransom.
- Already?

23:31.683 --> 23:34.418
I'm still a man
of some influence, Mr Klein.

23:34.485 --> 23:37.721
The money is in an account
awaiting transfer.

23:37.789 --> 23:39.989
OK. Well, we have
five hours left

23:40.057 --> 23:42.625
and my team are following up
a very promising lead.

23:42.693 --> 23:45.795
- I understand, but the risk--
- ...doesn't just vanish

23:45.863 --> 23:49.833
when you hit "send"
on the money transfer.

23:49.900 --> 23:52.768
Mr Ayim, I want to give this
to you as straight as possible.

23:52.837 --> 23:54.904
There is a good chance
that your son will be executed

23:54.972 --> 23:56.905
as soon as your money clears

23:56.973 --> 23:59.074
and the only chip
we have left to play is time.

23:59.142 --> 24:02.244
So I'm asking, please:
don't take that away from us,

24:02.312 --> 24:04.346
not now, not when
we're making real progress.

24:04.413 --> 24:07.615
Sir, you can't be
considering this.

24:07.683 --> 24:10.685
We've already agreed
on our course of action.

24:10.753 --> 24:13.654
I'll delay the payment.

24:13.722 --> 24:17.458
But if anything
should happen to my son,

24:17.525 --> 24:19.560
I will hold you
personally responsible.

24:22.097 --> 24:25.266
I told you I don't know
anything about the missing kid.

24:25.334 --> 24:27.268
Then why did you run?

24:27.336 --> 24:30.170
You found the distillery:

24:30.238 --> 24:32.505
I panicked.

24:32.573 --> 24:35.541
Look, we know you've been harassing Ayim's son.
You've been hanging around his school.

24:35.609 --> 24:38.644
What? That...

24:41.648 --> 24:45.351
OK, yes. There was one time,
but not at his school.

24:45.418 --> 24:48.653
We'd had a few drinks
and we ran into the kid

24:48.721 --> 24:50.789
at the gas station
near the club.

24:53.026 --> 24:54.994
He was a...

24:55.061 --> 24:57.863
a convenient target,
that's all.

24:57.931 --> 25:01.866
It's his father making my life
a living hell, not him.

25:01.934 --> 25:05.236
- What's your problem with Ayim?
- We came to this country

25:05.304 --> 25:08.606
to escape his oppression.

25:08.673 --> 25:12.076
And what do we get, huh?
More of the same.

25:12.144 --> 25:13.978
It's disgraceful!

25:14.046 --> 25:16.114
How is he making
your life a living hell?

25:16.181 --> 25:18.348
His thugs are shaking down
the club for money.

25:18.416 --> 25:20.918
I run an non-profit
business here.

25:20.985 --> 25:23.320
Most of my proceeds
are sent back home to Liberia

25:23.388 --> 25:25.222
to help
with the rebuilding efforts.

25:25.290 --> 25:27.925
But now, that cash
is in his pockets,

25:27.992 --> 25:30.928
while I'm forced to make my own
booze, just to stay in business.

25:30.995 --> 25:34.230
Who do you send
your proceeds to back home?

25:34.298 --> 25:37.499
I don't send them directly,
I use a broker, a local guy.

25:37.567 --> 25:39.302
Does he have a name?

25:39.369 --> 25:42.204
Yeah.
But you're not getting it.

25:42.272 --> 25:44.606
<i>Ayim</i>
<i>finds out, I am a dead man.</i>

25:47.477 --> 25:49.978
You're scared of Ayim?

25:50.046 --> 25:52.013
Hell, yeah, I'm scared of him.
He's a cold-blooded killer!

25:52.081 --> 25:54.783
- Look, we've all heard the rumours, and--
- Rumours?

25:54.851 --> 25:57.052
Are you kidding me?

25:57.119 --> 25:59.888
The man is a monster.

25:59.956 --> 26:02.491
I saw it with my own eyes.

26:22.910 --> 26:26.045
- You OK?
- Yeah.

26:26.113 --> 26:28.949
Did you get anything that ties him
to being our schoolyard mystery man?

26:29.016 --> 26:30.884
No, but he's telling
the truth about Ayim.

26:30.952 --> 26:33.520
That doesn't surprise me.

26:33.588 --> 26:36.356
What does surprise me is a man with millions
of dollars is shaking down local businesses.

26:36.423 --> 26:38.423
He had stopped the payments
to Ibrahim's mother.

26:38.492 --> 26:41.460
I'll have Dev
look into his finances.

26:41.528 --> 26:44.663
There's someone
we need to talk to again.

26:44.731 --> 26:47.032
What did you want me to say?
By the way,

26:47.100 --> 26:49.034
I've been funneling money
to Liberian protest groups

26:49.102 --> 26:51.236
to help the fight against
government corruption?

26:51.304 --> 26:54.205
Well, Hamissi seems to think his money
is going towards rebuilding efforts.

26:54.272 --> 26:56.841
Yeah, well, I get the money
to where it does the most good.

26:56.909 --> 27:00.712
<i>They need</i>
<i>weapons, not care packages.</i>

27:00.779 --> 27:03.581
You see, I imagine Hamissi
would love to know

27:03.649 --> 27:05.717
that his money is actually
putting guns

27:05.784 --> 27:07.485
- in the hands of rebels.
- That's...

27:07.553 --> 27:11.655
You can't prove anything.

27:11.723 --> 27:15.091
Besides, what does any of this
have to with a missing kid? - Plenty.

27:15.159 --> 27:18.528
By taking money out of Hamissi's pocket, Ayim
was unknowingly taking money out of yours.

27:18.595 --> 27:21.063
And you need the cash,

27:21.131 --> 27:23.032
so by holding his son
for ransom, you get the money

27:23.099 --> 27:24.800
- and your revenge all at once.
- You're wrong.

27:24.868 --> 27:27.603
I'm looking for justice,
not revenge.

27:27.671 --> 27:30.305
I want Ayim to pay
for the evil he's done.

27:30.373 --> 27:33.875
I'm an activist,
not a criminal.

27:33.943 --> 27:36.745
Well, this wouldn't be
the first time

27:36.812 --> 27:39.014
those lines have blurred.

27:39.081 --> 27:42.684
- I don't like him. He's cocky.
- There's something about him.

27:42.752 --> 27:46.120
- Yeah.
- Hey, guys!

27:46.188 --> 27:49.024
So I dug into Ayim's finances
like you suggested:

27:49.091 --> 27:51.592
you gotta check this out.
Just hit the top file there.

27:51.660 --> 27:54.362
OK, hold on.
These numbers are accurate?

27:54.430 --> 27:56.397
Yeah. Ayim invested heavily
in the market

27:56.465 --> 27:58.566
just in time for it to crash.
He lost a fortune.

27:58.633 --> 28:00.634
I mean, that combined
with bad property investments

28:00.702 --> 28:02.570
and lavish spending, the guy's
barely keeping his head

28:02.637 --> 28:04.638
- above water.
- So he's actually broke.

28:04.706 --> 28:07.374
- Close to it, yeah.
- So his son being kidnapped

28:07.442 --> 28:10.243
would give him the perfect opportunity to
start begging for large sums of money.

28:10.311 --> 28:12.612
You think he could've set
this up to pad his bank account?

28:12.680 --> 28:14.548
I think it's a bear
worth poking.

28:14.615 --> 28:16.583
Either way,
hopefully it leads somewhere,

28:16.650 --> 28:18.585
because we have less than three
hours.

28:18.652 --> 28:20.920
Hey, Liv!

28:20.988 --> 28:22.921
He's insisting
I bring you back in to see him,

28:22.989 --> 28:25.191
against my advice.
He's refusing to take his meds

28:25.258 --> 28:27.560
before he speaks to you, so he
can be more focused.

28:27.627 --> 28:29.928
The pain has to be
excruciating, Toby.

28:29.996 --> 28:32.998
- Please go easy on him.
- Kid gloves, OK?

28:33.066 --> 28:35.101
- OK.
- Come on, let's do this.

28:39.739 --> 28:41.673
Quazy,

28:41.741 --> 28:45.176
hey.

28:45.244 --> 28:47.779
You wanted to see us.

28:47.847 --> 28:51.282
- Yes. I want to help.
- Good.

28:51.350 --> 28:53.784
Ibrahim isn't just
my responsibility.

28:53.852 --> 28:55.786
He's my friend.

28:55.854 --> 28:58.188
Do you remember what happened?

29:03.061 --> 29:04.795
He's seizing!

29:04.863 --> 29:07.231
- Hold him down.
- OK, all right.

29:07.298 --> 29:10.533
He's in arrest.
Give me the cart!

29:13.070 --> 29:15.905
So Dev is looking into
the vehicle make and model.

29:15.973 --> 29:19.275
- Good, thank you.
You know both gunmen were black:

29:19.343 --> 29:21.645
- Harwell's not the shooter.
- He could've been driving.

29:21.712 --> 29:23.713
- Mm-hm.
- Hey!

29:23.781 --> 29:25.681
Hey, where's my coffee?

29:25.749 --> 29:27.616
What are you doing
here so late?

29:27.684 --> 29:29.785
Oh, wasn't tired.
I'm going to check in on Quazy,

29:29.853 --> 29:33.388
unless you guys
lost him again... OK.

29:35.525 --> 29:37.626
Hey, great job, Dev.

29:37.694 --> 29:39.594
Thanks for running
those vehicle plates.

29:39.663 --> 29:42.396
Man, the bank records?
Awesome!

29:42.464 --> 29:44.331
Oh, and doing a search
for those initials?

29:44.399 --> 29:46.167
You're the best.
You're a computer wizard!

29:46.234 --> 29:48.936
We'd be lost without you.

29:58.646 --> 30:00.180
What do we have?

30:00.247 --> 30:02.348
Well, thanks to our
description of the vehicle,

30:02.416 --> 30:05.852
Dev was able to do a search for traffic light
photos in the vicinity of the crime scene.

30:08.122 --> 30:10.323
- Wow, that's Rafiq!
- Where did you get this?

30:10.391 --> 30:12.993
It was taken six blocks
from the abduction site,

30:13.061 --> 30:15.961
- two minutes after it happened.
- Where's Rafiq now?

30:16.029 --> 30:18.164
- I don't know.
- I don't believe you.

30:18.231 --> 30:21.600
I think a man like you knows exactly
where his men are at all times.

30:21.668 --> 30:24.170
So which one did you have
shadowing your son at his school?

30:24.237 --> 30:26.271
Which one almost killed
your driver?

30:26.339 --> 30:28.340
What are you insinuating?

30:28.408 --> 30:32.210
- Did you order the abduction of your son?
- Mr Klein.

30:32.277 --> 30:35.479
I got something here
you should see.

30:35.547 --> 30:37.582
This package just got
dropped off by courier.

30:37.649 --> 30:39.350
- Has it been checked?
- Yeah.

30:39.418 --> 30:42.353
I think you better
have a look for yourself.

30:42.421 --> 30:44.956
Huh.

30:48.392 --> 30:52.129
My God.

30:56.858 --> 30:58.992
I can't believe
they sent us a damn finger.

30:59.060 --> 31:00.445
Finger's on the way to the lab

31:00.565 --> 31:01.722
to test for DNA.

31:01.948 --> 31:04.033
You still think Ayim
might be behind this?

31:04.138 --> 31:06.073
Yeah. I've seen
what he's capable of.

31:06.140 --> 31:08.689
- I wouldn't put it past him.
- Maybe this is Rafiq's doing:

31:08.809 --> 31:12.195
he finds out his boss is broke and looks for
an alternative to the unemployment line.

31:12.315 --> 31:14.380
- Did you question the courier?
- Yeah,

31:14.448 --> 31:16.615
he says he has no idea
what he was carrying.

31:16.683 --> 31:18.951
The package and cash were
waiting for him at pickup.

31:19.019 --> 31:22.010
- Hm.
- So, where does this leave us?

31:22.574 --> 31:23.356
Nothing's changed,

31:23.423 --> 31:25.791
so long as we have the money,
we hold all the cards.

31:25.859 --> 31:29.427
No more games: the ransom
will be sent immediately.

31:30.215 --> 31:32.063
This is exactly what they want.

31:32.131 --> 31:34.399
- You can't--
- I can and I will.

31:34.467 --> 31:37.502
One call to the bank
and it will finally be over.

31:37.569 --> 31:39.804
Well, that's
not going to happen.

31:39.872 --> 31:42.340
Your account has been frozen,
pending investigation.

31:42.408 --> 31:45.977
You can't do that! I obtained
those loans through legal means!

31:46.044 --> 31:49.046
So your financers are aware that you
have no way of paying them back?

31:49.114 --> 31:51.415
Then there's the question of
your personal security details

31:51.483 --> 31:53.283
shaking down local businesses.

31:53.351 --> 31:56.020
He's my son.

31:56.087 --> 31:59.122
We haven't given up on him.

31:59.189 --> 32:01.892
OK, people, we have less than
90 minutes to figure this out.

32:01.959 --> 32:03.960
- Let's stay with it!
- All right.

32:12.202 --> 32:14.237
Hey, Oz!

32:14.304 --> 32:16.939
- Hey! How's he doing in there?
- Stabilized,

32:17.007 --> 32:18.908
but until we find the real
source of the trouble,

32:18.975 --> 32:20.943
he's still at risk.
I'll keep you updated.

32:21.011 --> 32:24.914
- OK, I'll be here.
- Go home! You look exhausted!

32:24.981 --> 32:28.584
Oh, excuse me,
it's been a long day.

32:28.652 --> 32:30.952
OK, what's going on?
It isn't like you,

32:31.020 --> 32:32.854
- moping over a patient.
- No, it's nothing.

32:32.922 --> 32:36.858
It's just, uh...
it's a work thing.

32:39.061 --> 32:42.496
It's Ryder. - Ryder. - Yeah.

32:42.565 --> 32:45.733
This whole supervisor thing...

32:45.801 --> 32:47.935
I thought he'd be a lot more
supportive and it's like...

32:48.002 --> 32:50.103
it's like he's trying
to hold me back.

32:50.171 --> 32:53.073
- I don't get it.
- My advice?

32:53.140 --> 32:54.608
Yeah.

32:54.676 --> 32:57.611
You need to be having
this conversation with him.

33:05.686 --> 33:08.988
There's not a whole lot
of intel on Rafiq.

33:09.056 --> 33:12.091
The car is under Ayim's name,
his apartment's in Ayim's name.

33:12.158 --> 33:14.026
I don't even have a personal
bank account on record here.

33:14.094 --> 33:16.028
There's got
to be a paper trial.

33:16.096 --> 33:18.030
Well, we have a SIN number and
a driver's license, that's it.

33:18.098 --> 33:19.931
He's working hard
to stay off the radar.

33:19.999 --> 33:21.933
- He's doing a good at that.
- Hey, guys!

33:22.001 --> 33:24.435
- Yeah?
- I got to show you something.

33:24.503 --> 33:27.872
By utilizing traffic cams and
other security camera feeds,

33:27.940 --> 33:30.108
I've pieced together
the route taken by the SUV.

33:30.175 --> 33:33.244
- Dev, this is great.
- Thanks! Don't get too excited:

33:33.312 --> 33:35.212
they fell off the grid here.

33:35.279 --> 33:37.848
So we got them pinned down
on the Portlands

33:37.916 --> 33:40.751
between Cherry and Lesley, but that's
still an extensive search, so...

33:40.819 --> 33:43.921
Well, Rafiq is smart: he's going to choose
a location that we can't link back to him.

33:43.989 --> 33:46.023
You know, there's a lot of
abandoned buildings

33:46.091 --> 33:48.959
in that area: we got called out there all the time.
It's a haven for the homeless.

33:49.027 --> 33:52.194
I'll get a list
of addresses together.

33:54.832 --> 33:56.666
Let's try the old boat house
on Commissioner's next.

33:56.734 --> 33:59.035
Wait, I think I got something.
According to city hydro,

33:59.103 --> 34:02.739
- the warehouse on Unwin has been
without electricity for years. - And?

34:02.806 --> 34:04.674
And there was a work order
placed three days ago,

34:04.742 --> 34:06.775
requesting the power
be turned back on.

34:24.092 --> 34:24.925
- That's it?
- Yeah.

34:24.993 --> 34:27.862
I'll call backup.

34:27.929 --> 34:29.728
OK, we have ten minutes.
I don't trust Rafiq

34:29.797 --> 34:31.632
to keep his cool
then the money doesn't show.

34:31.699 --> 34:33.634
-I say we go in now.
- Yeah.

34:43.678 --> 34:47.280
All clear.

34:47.347 --> 34:50.650
Stay close, keep your head
down and try not to get us shot.

34:50.717 --> 34:53.286
Comforting pep talk.

35:02.528 --> 35:05.830
I make three gunmen.

35:05.898 --> 35:08.066
That's that kid
from the schoolyard!

35:08.133 --> 35:10.569
He must've fed us that story
to throw us off.

35:10.636 --> 35:13.505
- You see Rafiq?
- Ibrahim must be up where the guard is.

35:13.573 --> 35:16.440
Rafiq might be up there
with him.

35:19.644 --> 35:22.513
OK, looks like we got an opening.
When I go up, you cover me.

35:22.581 --> 35:25.015
- OK. You're with me.
- OK.

35:56.145 --> 35:57.779
gunshot)

35:57.847 --> 36:00.882
What are you waiting for?
Kill him!

36:00.950 --> 36:03.318
Police! Down on the ground!

36:32.680 --> 36:34.547
Michelle! Behind you!

36:43.657 --> 36:47.125
- Everyone OK?
- I'm good.

36:47.193 --> 36:50.061
Yeah.

36:57.235 --> 37:00.471
I got him.

37:02.541 --> 37:04.909
Thank you. Thank you.
You all right?

37:04.976 --> 37:07.945
How's your hand? I'm a paramedic.
All right, the blood's dry.

37:08.013 --> 37:09.946
Leave the bandage on
'til we get to the hospital.

37:10.014 --> 37:13.249
What happened to Quazy?
My driver? Is he all right?

37:13.318 --> 37:16.953
- Yeah, he's fine. He's been worried sick about you.
- Please, can I just...

37:17.021 --> 37:20.089
- can I get some fresh air, please?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'll take you.

37:20.157 --> 37:23.493
- Good work, man.
- Let's get you some fresh air.

37:25.829 --> 37:29.332
Dev!

37:29.399 --> 37:32.768
- Yeah?
- It's him!

37:32.836 --> 37:34.903
One move, he's dead.

37:38.912 --> 37:41.832
- OK. Just take it easy.
- Drop your weapon.

37:41.952 --> 37:43.079
Now!

37:45.309 --> 37:47.050
It wasn't your finger.

37:51.028 --> 37:52.907
My father could've been
a great man.

37:53.746 --> 37:55.179
He had the power,
he had the money,

37:55.246 --> 37:57.047
but he lost the trust
of his people.

37:57.115 --> 37:59.583
That cost him everything.

37:59.650 --> 38:00.863
<i>I will</i>
<i>not make the same mistake.</i>

38:00.983 --> 38:02.719
You want everything
your father had, but lost?

38:02.786 --> 38:05.454
I hate it here.
And with ten million dollars,

38:05.522 --> 38:07.690
I can start my new life
with my friends.

38:07.758 --> 38:09.692
True friends,

38:09.760 --> 38:11.994
who love me and trust me
to protect them.

38:12.062 --> 38:14.964
- What friends? Uh, like Quazy?
- Quazy is a great guy,

38:15.032 --> 38:17.899
but he would've tried
to talk me out of this.

38:17.967 --> 38:20.736
- So instead, you got him shot?
- It wasn't supposed to happen.

38:20.803 --> 38:24.572
What about this guy? With his finger, when
you cut that off? Was that an accident?

38:24.640 --> 38:26.908
You still don't get it!

38:30.847 --> 38:34.481
I won't forget your sacrifice.

38:37.079 --> 38:40.420
He wanted to, for you.

38:40.488 --> 38:44.491
That's sick, man.
That's not true love.

38:44.559 --> 38:46.426
These aren't your friends,
these are your followers.

38:46.494 --> 38:47.920
Stop that!
That's not true!

38:48.040 --> 38:52.098
Violence, manipulation,
fraud... You think that's trust?

38:52.166 --> 38:55.769
- You're twisting my words!
- You haven't escaped your father. You've become him!

38:55.836 --> 38:59.005
Shut up, it's not true!

39:10.383 --> 39:12.350
- Bone shards?
- That's right,

39:12.418 --> 39:15.087
but we were able
to remove them all,

39:15.155 --> 39:17.455
so it'll be painful,
but you'll make a full recovery.

39:17.523 --> 39:20.592
The pain here

39:20.660 --> 39:23.795
it's not as bad
as the pain here.

39:23.862 --> 39:25.897
I lost a dear friend.

39:28.433 --> 39:31.302
You know what?
If it's any consolation,

39:31.369 --> 39:33.337
I think you picked a good BFF.

39:33.405 --> 39:36.140
- Ha! Oz.
- Yes.

39:36.208 --> 39:38.074
He was here when
I first woke up.

39:38.142 --> 39:40.911
- Was he?
- Does he always talk so much?

39:40.978 --> 39:43.146
- He does, yes.
- Ha! Ha!

39:43.214 --> 39:45.481
I like him, I think he's funny.

39:45.549 --> 39:47.984
Do you know
he offered to get me a job

39:48.052 --> 39:50.187
- at his parents' restaurant?
- Really?

39:50.254 --> 39:53.123
Don't tell him I said so,
but... I can do better.

39:53.191 --> 39:55.757
I won't.

39:55.826 --> 39:57.659
So you're gonna quit your job?

39:57.727 --> 40:00.495
It's for the best, I think.

40:00.563 --> 40:04.166
And to be honest,
I'm ready for a change.

40:04.234 --> 40:06.335
You know, there's
a lot of that going around.

40:06.402 --> 40:10.038
- Sir, can I talk to you for a second?
- What can I do for you?

40:10.105 --> 40:13.341
Did I do something wrong, sir? Did I
mess up and you didn't tell me about it?

40:13.408 --> 40:15.243
- What are you talking about?
- Well, I'm trying to think

40:15.311 --> 40:17.078
of a reason, any reason,
why you would stand in the way

40:17.146 --> 40:18.880
of me trying to take
the next step here.

40:18.948 --> 40:21.082
Well, it's just that...

40:21.150 --> 40:23.351
I don't think you're ready.

40:23.418 --> 40:26.987
I am ready.
Sir, I want this.

40:27.055 --> 40:29.857
I'm not scared of the workload
or the time commitment.

40:29.924 --> 40:32.059
What I'm scared of
is looking back on my life

40:32.126 --> 40:34.026
ten years from now and realizing
I didn't challenge myself

40:34.094 --> 40:36.229
to do more with it. So I
can't change your opinion of me,

40:36.296 --> 40:38.297
but I got news for you:
I'm going to write

40:38.366 --> 40:40.367
this supervisor exam
whether you help me or not.

40:46.407 --> 40:49.842
Congratulations.

40:49.909 --> 40:51.810
- On what?
- On passing your first test.

40:51.878 --> 40:54.346
My first test? Sir, I don't
know what you're talking about.

40:54.414 --> 40:58.417
I had to be sure that you
were 100% dedicated to this.

40:58.485 --> 41:02.153
Read them, memorize them,
live 'em and breathe 'em.

41:02.221 --> 41:04.256
Yes, sir!

41:04.323 --> 41:06.991
Here's your training manuals.

41:07.058 --> 41:08.993
All right,
there's a lot of them.

41:09.060 --> 41:11.629
I don't how you breathe a book,
but I will get to it, sir. - Anything else?

41:11.697 --> 41:15.767
Thank you. I will get
right on this, sir! Sir?

41:15.834 --> 41:20.304
- You will not regret this.
- Uh-huh.

41:20.372 --> 41:22.672
You don't expect me to open that
up for you, do you, Mr Bey?

41:22.740 --> 41:26.510
No, no. I'm a supervisor now.
I got my own doors!

41:29.680 --> 41:33.016
The case we have against your
son is overwhelming, sir,

41:33.083 --> 41:35.351
not to mention the fact that he
tried to kill one of my officers.

41:36.888 --> 41:39.121
- Ibrahim!
- Mr Ayim, wait. Wait!

41:39.188 --> 41:41.223
Ibrahim, look at me!

41:41.291 --> 41:43.793
Turn around
and face me like a man!

41:43.860 --> 41:46.995
Ibrahim!

41:47.063 --> 41:49.765
<i>I only wanted to protect you</i>

41:49.833 --> 41:51.901
<i>from my mistakes.</i>

41:51.968 --> 41:54.368
When you're ready, sir.
