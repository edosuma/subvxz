WEBVTT

00:15.916 --> 00:18.052
- Hi.
- Security!

00:18.119 --> 00:20.688
- [chuckles]
- Just kidding.

00:20.754 --> 00:22.056
Sorta kinda.

00:24.658 --> 00:26.760
Can we talk?

00:26.827 --> 00:29.563
Yeah, sure.

00:29.630 --> 00:31.932
Oh, okay. Here.

00:31.999 --> 00:34.135
- Um, let's--
- Yeah, okay--

00:35.436 --> 00:38.939
I just had this experience
the other day--

00:39.006 --> 00:42.243
[stammering]
...with my mother,

00:42.310 --> 00:44.478
and I kind of had
this epiphany

00:44.545 --> 00:46.614
that I know what
my problem is.

00:46.680 --> 00:50.351
- Oh. Uh-huh.
- And my problem is
that I wasn't parented.

00:50.418 --> 00:52.820
Oh, you were talking
about that orphanage theory.

00:52.886 --> 00:55.356
You were raised
in the Palisades.
Yeah, that was tough.

00:55.423 --> 00:57.091
But someways, it really--
I mean, my mother really--

00:57.158 --> 00:58.392
I wasn't mothered.

00:58.459 --> 01:00.194
- Weren't mothered?
- You know?

01:00.261 --> 01:02.296
And I've been, like,
looking for that love

01:02.363 --> 01:07.135
to fill that missing
mother love, you know?

01:07.168 --> 01:09.503
But I kind of lost
the plot completely,

01:09.570 --> 01:12.005
which is that I'm not here
to get that.

01:12.140 --> 01:14.542
We're here to take care
of each other.

01:14.608 --> 01:18.312
And I didn't
take care of you.

01:18.379 --> 01:21.515
- Oh...
- And I'm sorry.

01:23.217 --> 01:25.786
So why-- why now?

01:25.853 --> 01:29.022
- No text, no appointment--
- Oh, God, I'm sorry.

01:29.157 --> 01:31.259
- No email--
- It's Yom Kippur today.

01:31.325 --> 01:33.361
- Oh, it's Yom Kippur today.
- Yeah.

01:33.427 --> 01:35.929
- So I have to come today.
- Oh.

01:35.996 --> 01:38.632
You go-- It's kind of like
trick-or-treating.

01:38.699 --> 01:41.635
- Trick-or-treating.
- People that you hurt,
you think about.

01:41.702 --> 01:44.004
Think about your wrongs
and apologize,

01:44.071 --> 01:46.174
and then ask for forgiveness.

01:46.240 --> 01:47.775
You know,
then you get forgiveness,

01:47.841 --> 01:51.445
and then you sort of
absolve yourself.

01:58.452 --> 01:59.720
Cool.

02:02.456 --> 02:05.193
- Or you get absolved.
- Thank you, Sarah,

02:05.193 --> 02:07.861
but I don't want
your apology.

02:10.231 --> 02:12.600
Happy Yom Kippur.

02:12.666 --> 02:15.203
Okay, I was supposed
to ask three times.

02:15.203 --> 02:17.305
I think I only got two
in there.

02:21.275 --> 02:23.277
** [theme]

03:06.754 --> 03:08.756
I'll admit that
I'm Jonathan Bowles'

03:08.822 --> 03:12.159
top 101 break the fasts.

03:12.260 --> 03:13.727
I got it.

03:13.794 --> 03:15.763
- Whoa.
- I got it. It's fine.

03:17.097 --> 03:20.167
- Okay. Chairs there.
- Okay.

03:20.268 --> 03:23.170
Actually, on that side,
please, so they're across
from each other.

03:23.271 --> 03:26.440
No. Yeah. Symmetrical.

03:32.746 --> 03:34.982
So you're still mad at me,
I take it.

03:35.048 --> 03:37.518
Well, you didn't
tell me you were going over
to Leslie's house,

03:37.585 --> 03:39.019
and you definitely didn't tell
me you were gonna stay over.

03:39.086 --> 03:41.622
Okay, What if I was
vaguely attracted to her?

03:41.689 --> 03:42.756
What if?

03:42.823 --> 03:45.326
What if we could
just talk about it?

03:45.393 --> 03:48.529
Process it together?
Maybe even get turned on by it?

03:48.596 --> 03:51.164
Okay, so what?
You're into polyamory now?

03:51.299 --> 03:54.468
No, I'm just saying,
what if we didn't have
this, sort of,

03:54.535 --> 03:57.405
knee-jerk,
hetero-normative--

03:57.471 --> 03:59.307
Listen to yourself.
Listen to yourself.

03:59.340 --> 04:01.174
You've been queer for,
like, 30 seconds.

04:01.309 --> 04:03.311
- Jesus.
- That's my point.

04:03.377 --> 04:06.547
Listen to me.

04:06.614 --> 04:10.083
What is being queer
if not questioning everything?

04:10.150 --> 04:11.419
Right?

04:11.485 --> 04:13.621
What it means to be
in a relationship

04:13.687 --> 04:17.391
that's loving and trusting
and generous and--

04:17.458 --> 04:19.527
and we can do that
however we want.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.462
We can make up our own rules.

04:21.529 --> 04:23.431
Isn't that exciting?

04:23.497 --> 04:26.334
And I just want to talk about
this stuff before it gets

04:26.367 --> 04:30.404
hard and bad
and just do it right,

04:30.471 --> 04:34.775
just be open and brave.

04:39.647 --> 04:43.617
Knock, knock.
Special delivery
for Miss Maura.

04:43.684 --> 04:45.853
Nobody's gonna say
I'm a bad host, huh?

04:45.919 --> 04:48.756
I was worried that you might
be getting hot up here.

04:48.822 --> 04:51.559
I don't know if you know this,
but heat rises.

04:51.625 --> 04:54.261
- Scientific fact.
- What's-- What? Oh.

04:54.362 --> 04:56.597
What's going on?
What is that?

04:56.664 --> 04:58.632
- It's a swamp cooler.
- Oh.

04:58.699 --> 05:00.000
Yeah, it's gonna blow
some nice cool air on you.

05:00.067 --> 05:02.370
- Oh, thank you.
- So, did you sleep okay?

05:02.403 --> 05:05.205
I'm actually having
trouble sleeping lately.

05:05.272 --> 05:06.440
- Let me ask you--
- What?

05:06.507 --> 05:08.876
What kind of hormones
they have you on?

05:08.942 --> 05:10.944
You're asking--
Um...

05:11.011 --> 05:12.245
Do you know about this area?

05:12.380 --> 05:14.648
- Yeah.
- Oh, um...

05:14.715 --> 05:17.385
They have me on
what they call...

05:17.418 --> 05:20.120
- testosterone blockers.
- T-blockers, yeah.

05:20.187 --> 05:22.055
- Well, that sounds
about right...
- Yeah.

05:22.122 --> 05:24.157
...for a start.

05:24.224 --> 05:28.261
What are you thinking about
facial-- feminization wise?

05:28.396 --> 05:30.831
- I'm not thinking--
- No? Well, I'm thinking

05:30.898 --> 05:32.833
lower that hairline,
maybe some cheek implants

05:32.900 --> 05:35.403
and some fat transfer,
you know?

05:35.436 --> 05:38.606
Maybe a forehead
reconstruction.

05:38.672 --> 05:41.174
Maybe a little--
Maybe a facelift.

05:41.241 --> 05:43.544
- If I might?
- Yeah.

05:43.611 --> 05:45.613
500 CCs in the titty area.

05:45.679 --> 05:46.780
Nothing too big, 'cause
that's not you, you know?

05:46.847 --> 05:49.049
- No, it's not who I am.
- No.

05:50.751 --> 05:53.787
Did you know I helped
Shea out back in the day?

05:53.854 --> 05:55.589
- Nope.
- Shea's a beautiful girl.

05:55.656 --> 05:57.324
- Gorgeous.
- She is.

05:57.425 --> 05:59.092
Work of art.

05:59.159 --> 06:01.429
When she was done, I felt
like fucking Michelangelo.

06:01.495 --> 06:02.696
- Wow.
- Yeah.

06:02.763 --> 06:04.231
I wanted to sign
my name on her ass.

06:04.297 --> 06:06.467
- Okay.
- Yeah.

06:06.534 --> 06:07.901
When the time comes,

06:07.968 --> 06:09.837
I'll be happy to help
whatever you need.

06:09.903 --> 06:11.805
Thanks, Sal.

06:11.872 --> 06:15.443
I mean, Maura, you still
got some good years left.

06:15.509 --> 06:16.844
All right.

06:20.280 --> 06:21.749
I'm already starving.

06:21.815 --> 06:22.850
It's only 10
in the morning, Mom.

06:22.916 --> 06:24.452
[sighs]

06:24.452 --> 06:28.355
Do you see why I wanted
to get here early now?

06:28.456 --> 06:31.925
There's assigned seats.
It's not like you're
gonna miss the trailers.

06:31.992 --> 06:33.894
Oh, I could go for a little
buttered popcorn right now

06:33.961 --> 06:35.629
with some Raisinets.

06:35.696 --> 06:40.267
- Maybe Raquel can sneak us
past this fakakta security.
- Yeah.

06:40.333 --> 06:41.802
Good to see you.
You have your tickets?

06:41.869 --> 06:43.737
- You're all set? Good.
Good Yontif.
- Hi.

06:43.804 --> 06:46.874
I was schvitzing out there.

06:46.940 --> 06:50.210
- Good Yontif.
- Good Yontif to you.

06:50.277 --> 06:51.745
- Good Yontif.
- Hello.

06:51.812 --> 06:53.847
So are you two
brother and sister?

06:53.914 --> 06:56.584
[laughs]
Are you my third husband?

06:56.650 --> 06:59.052
- Ooh.
- Oh, my God.

06:59.119 --> 07:00.754
Let me ask you.

07:00.821 --> 07:03.657
I have two tickets reserved
that I haven't paid for yet.

07:03.724 --> 07:05.859
Is there a senior discount?

07:05.926 --> 07:09.530
Look at you.
You'd never qualify.

07:09.597 --> 07:11.732
And also,
there's no discount. Sorry.

07:11.799 --> 07:14.735
No matter.
You already made my Yom Kippur.

07:14.802 --> 07:17.738
- I'll look for you in there.
- I'm up front.

07:17.805 --> 07:20.508
My son's engaged to the rabbi.

07:20.574 --> 07:23.076
Good taste.
I see where he gets it.

07:23.143 --> 07:26.079
[chuckles]
Good Yontif.

07:26.146 --> 07:27.981
I'll be right back.

07:33.954 --> 07:35.989
Um, hi, it's me.

07:38.058 --> 07:40.528
Hello.

07:42.930 --> 07:45.265
- Hi.
- Um, okay.

07:45.332 --> 07:48.536
I just came by 'cause my mom
bought the tickets in July.

07:48.536 --> 07:51.338
I just wanted to let
you know that I'm here.

07:51.404 --> 07:54.207
I didn't want you to think,
like, I was stalking you.

07:54.274 --> 07:57.545
I didn't want you to freak out
if you saw me in the audience
or whatever.

07:57.578 --> 08:01.582
Well, thank you.
Thanks. Duly noted.

08:03.450 --> 08:06.754
Um... Okay, so--

08:06.820 --> 08:09.222
- Oh, Josh, I--
- It's a little embarrassing.

08:09.289 --> 08:12.560
But I just also--
I'm confused.

08:12.560 --> 08:15.095
And I had a quick question

08:15.162 --> 08:17.831
about what I'm supposed
to tell my family.

08:17.898 --> 08:19.933
Because, you know,
they're just, like,

08:20.000 --> 08:22.035
asking me a bunch
of questions--

08:22.102 --> 08:24.404
That's none of my business.
Tell them whatever
you want, buddy.

08:24.471 --> 08:26.574
No, I know.
But I just didn't want
to say the wrong thing,

08:26.640 --> 08:28.108
'cause I don't know
what we wanna be saying--

08:28.175 --> 08:30.210
We're over.

08:42.155 --> 08:43.624
Okay.

08:47.160 --> 08:48.929
[water bubbling]

08:53.701 --> 08:56.637
[groans]
What a pleasant surprise,

08:56.704 --> 09:00.908
you crawling through my window
like a sexy Peter Pan.

09:00.974 --> 09:04.612
I'm in a shit mood, okay?
I need to get happy, stat.

09:04.612 --> 09:06.680
- Feisty, all right.
- Obliterated.

09:06.747 --> 09:09.082
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Go easy on that lamb's bread.

09:09.149 --> 09:12.152
- Holy shit.
- That's very strong stuff.

09:12.219 --> 09:14.254
That's from Bob Marley's
mother plant.

09:14.321 --> 09:16.423
It's his mother's plant?

09:16.489 --> 09:18.792
[laughing]
What?

09:18.859 --> 09:20.060
- What?
- Oh, my God!

09:20.127 --> 09:21.394
You are adorable.

09:21.461 --> 09:23.430
No, it's from
the mother plant,

09:23.496 --> 09:24.898
like the mother
of all sensimilia.

09:24.965 --> 09:29.069
I mean it, though.
You need to go easy on that.

09:29.136 --> 09:30.503
This is so good.

09:30.638 --> 09:31.639
And it tastes so good.

09:31.672 --> 09:32.740
It tastes really strong.

09:32.806 --> 09:34.642
That is my private stash.

09:34.708 --> 09:36.509
It is just for me...

09:36.644 --> 09:38.078
and people
going through chemo.

09:38.145 --> 09:39.813
Are you saying
I can't handle it?

09:39.880 --> 09:42.449
Are you asking me
as your doctor...

09:42.515 --> 09:43.951
or your lover?

09:44.017 --> 09:45.686
Oh, my God, please,
don't say that word,.

09:45.753 --> 09:48.088
What? You don't like
the word "lover"?

09:48.155 --> 09:50.924
That is the unsexiest word
that was ever created.

09:50.991 --> 09:53.426
Did you not come over here
for a little bit of lovemaking?

09:53.493 --> 09:55.195
We don't make love.

09:55.262 --> 09:56.964
- What did you come here for?
- I didn't come here for that.

09:57.030 --> 09:58.799
I came here for
your big fat bong

09:58.866 --> 10:01.601
- and the free weed.
- That's what I thought.

10:01.669 --> 10:02.970
[chuckles]

10:06.539 --> 10:08.375
These aren't ripe,
but it's all they had.

10:08.441 --> 10:11.044
It is really hard to make food
when you're starving.

10:11.111 --> 10:13.480
Everything is starting
to look like food.

10:13.546 --> 10:14.682
I could eat this counter.

10:14.748 --> 10:15.983
I could eat that spoon.

10:16.049 --> 10:18.085
It looks like Swiss cheese
to me now.

10:18.151 --> 10:19.486
Hey, Ali?

10:19.552 --> 10:22.222
I'm-- I'm freaking out
right now.

10:22.289 --> 10:24.191
Okay. What's wrong?

10:24.257 --> 10:27.828
Well, I'm just--
I'm getting a little bit
of that PTSD feeling

10:27.895 --> 10:29.096
that I had with Josh.

10:29.162 --> 10:31.198
Like, I need to know
if you're with me,

10:31.264 --> 10:32.766
or if you're not with me.

10:32.833 --> 10:36.436
I'm just trying
to be honest about

10:36.503 --> 10:38.371
what I need
and what I feel.

10:38.438 --> 10:41.875
- Woman: You're guests
are here!
- [knocking on door]

10:45.245 --> 10:47.347
[door opens]

10:47.414 --> 10:49.850
- Good Yontif!
- Hi, Andy! Hi!

10:49.917 --> 10:54.221
Look at this! Beat the traffic.
Straight shot down the 101.

10:54.287 --> 10:55.655
- Thanks, Mom.
- Look at you!

10:55.723 --> 10:56.757
Our little balabusta.

10:56.824 --> 10:58.892
- Still warm!
- It was Ali's idea.

10:58.959 --> 11:00.794
[overlapping chatter]

11:00.861 --> 11:02.996
- Nice to see you.
- Hi!

11:05.465 --> 11:07.935
- Here.
- No, I got it.

11:08.001 --> 11:09.870
- Come on in.
- Thanks.

11:13.473 --> 11:16.176
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:16.243 --> 11:17.745
Good morning.

11:19.212 --> 11:19.947
Oh.

11:20.013 --> 11:22.049
- There you go.
- Thank you.

11:25.753 --> 11:27.620
Is Sal about?

11:27.755 --> 11:29.790
No. What's up?

11:29.857 --> 11:33.526
Oh, do you think
it's odd that...

11:33.593 --> 11:35.395
you haven't met
his family yet?

11:35.462 --> 11:37.831
I don't really--

11:37.898 --> 11:40.400
That's a choice
that we both made.

11:40.467 --> 11:42.770
Name me one time when
meeting somebody's family

11:42.803 --> 11:44.004
actually made
a relationship better.

11:44.071 --> 11:45.873
Does he talk to you
about your body?

11:45.939 --> 11:49.209
Because he talks to me
about my body.

11:49.276 --> 11:52.279
- What do you--
- Your Sal came in
the turret today,

11:52.345 --> 11:56.016
and, oh, he talked to me
about how many

11:56.083 --> 11:59.252
CCs should be
in my titty area.

11:59.319 --> 12:03.323
And I'm gonna tell you one thing
from the bottom of my heart.

12:03.390 --> 12:06.794
You can do better than that.

12:08.461 --> 12:13.533
My God, who do you think
you're talking to?

12:13.600 --> 12:16.003
I'm gonna tell you
one thing.

12:16.069 --> 12:18.238
Mind your own
goddamn business.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.342
You have no right.

12:22.409 --> 12:26.379
We don't all have your family.
We don't all have your money.

12:26.446 --> 12:29.817
I'm a 53-year-old
ex-prostitute

12:29.817 --> 12:33.253
HIV-positive woman
with a dick.

12:33.320 --> 12:36.323
And I know what I want,
and I know what I need.

12:36.389 --> 12:39.960
And if Sal is bothering you
this much...

12:42.495 --> 12:44.832
...you should probably
sleep somewhere else.

12:50.838 --> 12:53.841
[chanting in Hebrew]

13:02.850 --> 13:07.454
Raquel:
We have sinned against you
willingly and unwillingly.

13:07.520 --> 13:11.391
[chanting continues]

13:11.458 --> 13:15.662
And we have sinned against you
by hardening our hearts.

13:15.728 --> 13:17.430
[chanting continues]

13:20.600 --> 13:25.105
We have sinned against you
by acting without thinking.

13:25.172 --> 13:27.374
[chanting continues]

13:29.776 --> 13:33.780
And we have sinned against
you by speaking perversely.

13:33.881 --> 13:35.415
[chanting continues]

13:35.482 --> 13:39.519
And we have sinned against you
publicly and privately.

13:39.586 --> 13:43.623
We have sinned against you
knowingly and deceitfully.

13:43.690 --> 13:47.727
We have sinned against
you by corrupt speech.

13:47.794 --> 13:50.063
By wronging others.

13:50.130 --> 13:52.032
By evil thoughts.

13:52.099 --> 13:53.600
For all these sins,

13:53.666 --> 13:56.904
oh, God of forgiveness,

13:56.937 --> 13:58.738
forgive us, pardon us,

13:58.805 --> 14:01.975
grant us atonement.

14:02.042 --> 14:04.978
We have sinned against you.

14:05.045 --> 14:06.679
We have sinned against you.

14:06.746 --> 14:08.681
We have sinned against you.

14:08.748 --> 14:11.084
[chanting continues]

14:20.928 --> 14:25.933
[chanting continues]

14:36.944 --> 14:40.247
[chanting continues]

14:46.153 --> 14:47.487
[chanting ends]

14:53.426 --> 14:56.296
[Man moaning]

15:01.734 --> 15:03.203
I'm sorry.
I'm not feeling this.

15:03.270 --> 15:04.871
- I'm just not feeling this.
- What's the matter?

15:04.972 --> 15:06.639
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.
It's not working.

15:06.706 --> 15:08.041
- I'm sorry.
- Oh.

15:08.108 --> 15:10.743
Fuck. Have you ever
gotten, like, so high

15:10.810 --> 15:13.981
that, like, all of
a sudden, you feel like
you're totally sober?

15:14.047 --> 15:14.982
I feel like I'm totally--

15:15.048 --> 15:17.217
Yeah, like,
all the time.

15:17.284 --> 15:19.352
You gotta smoke through it.
You wanna take another hit?

15:19.419 --> 15:21.989
No, no. It's like--
I don't-- It's, like,
not working.

15:22.022 --> 15:24.157
Like, this isn't working.
I mean, no offense.

15:24.224 --> 15:25.392
No, no. None taken.

15:25.458 --> 15:28.095
I just want you
to be harder.

15:28.161 --> 15:30.297
I just am trying
to give you pleasure.

15:30.363 --> 15:32.165
I don't want you
to give me pleasure.

15:32.232 --> 15:34.634
I want you to--
I want you to take it.

15:34.701 --> 15:37.404
Like, I kinda wanna--
It's, like-- Sorta, like--

15:37.470 --> 15:39.139
Like, I just wanna
be so consumed.

15:39.206 --> 15:42.175
I want you to rape me,
but I don't want it to hurt.

15:42.242 --> 15:43.276
I want it, like, gentle.

15:43.343 --> 15:45.212
Like, I kinda want,
like-- like--

15:45.278 --> 15:48.015
Like a rapist who wants
to makes sure you come.

15:48.081 --> 15:49.249
Does that make sense?

15:49.316 --> 15:50.783
Oh, this is--
You know what--

15:50.850 --> 15:52.652
I'm obviously not doing
what you want.

15:52.719 --> 15:56.056
It's weird.
You should talk
to my friend Gary.

15:56.123 --> 15:57.624
He does all my computers.

15:57.690 --> 16:01.094
He's part of a whole, like,
community of kinky people.

16:01.161 --> 16:04.364
You know, topping,
bottoming, BDSM--

16:04.431 --> 16:06.599
I'm not into BD--
I'm not like those people.

16:06.666 --> 16:08.368
Those people have, like,
fucking sex burgers.

16:08.435 --> 16:11.238
What is sex burgers?
That doesn't exist.

16:11.304 --> 16:15.308
It's, like, you know,
like kids that are obsessed
with magic and Star Wars,

16:15.375 --> 16:18.145
except it's adults and all
they wanna do is have sex.

16:18.211 --> 16:19.479
- You're not?
- No!

16:19.546 --> 16:21.248
Because you just
ran down a litany

16:21.314 --> 16:23.116
of things that
you want me to do to you.

16:23.183 --> 16:24.584
- Okay.
- Wha--

16:26.453 --> 16:29.422
Okay, you know what?
I'm supposed to be fasting

16:29.489 --> 16:31.558
and like...

16:31.624 --> 16:33.593
you know, making amends.

16:33.660 --> 16:35.695
And I'm fucking high--

16:35.762 --> 16:39.232
Anyway, did you know
it's Yom Kippur?

16:39.299 --> 16:41.534
Is it a Seder you gotta go to?
What's up?

16:41.601 --> 16:43.070
No.

16:43.070 --> 16:45.705
It's the holiest day
of the year.

16:58.951 --> 17:00.853
[knocking on door]

17:00.920 --> 17:02.422
[overlapping chatter]

17:02.489 --> 17:04.491
That's so sad that
that's not my bagel.

17:04.557 --> 17:07.094
- That's all I'm saying.
- Can you open this, please?

17:07.094 --> 17:09.196
- His name is Buzz.
- Oh.

17:09.262 --> 17:10.997
He's the Jewish Santa Claus,

17:11.098 --> 17:14.167
and he will be
arriving here with Mom.

17:14.234 --> 17:18.004
- Is Moppa gonna care?
- Who gives a fuck?

17:18.105 --> 17:19.572
What's going on
with you?

17:21.208 --> 17:25.178
- Hey, Feldmans!
- Oh, hi, Josh!

17:25.245 --> 17:28.248
- What's up!
- You look the same as ever...

17:28.315 --> 17:32.018
- except for the beard.
- That beard.

17:32.119 --> 17:33.653
I remember when you had
a little mustache.

17:33.720 --> 17:37.224
- How are your parents?
- Oh, the usual. You know.

17:37.290 --> 17:38.891
Mom's good.
Dad's a woman.

17:38.958 --> 17:42.562
Oh, yeah, that's right.
You told us.
That's quite a change.

17:42.629 --> 17:44.564
- Nice to see you.
- You, too.

17:44.631 --> 17:46.133
Your parents
are coming, right?

17:46.199 --> 17:48.168
- Yeah.
- I'm looking forward
to seeing them.

17:48.235 --> 17:50.937
And Josh has big news.
He's having a baby and
getting married.

17:51.003 --> 17:53.440
- Oh!
- Mazel tov.

17:53.506 --> 17:56.709
Congratulations.
Ali told me. That's great.

17:56.776 --> 17:58.945
Okay, I'm going
to warm up the blintzes

17:59.011 --> 18:01.148
so we can have
this, uh, wonderful meal.

18:01.214 --> 18:02.582
- Sweet.
- Great, great, great.

18:02.649 --> 18:04.184
- That's great news.
- Good to see you,

18:06.686 --> 18:09.322
I feel like we should've
had mimosas for sure.

18:09.389 --> 18:11.991
I feel like we should
definitely have more
bread balls.

18:12.058 --> 18:14.961
But Ali,
she's a lesbian now.

18:15.027 --> 18:17.464
- Are you getting all of this?
- Like a steel trap.

18:17.530 --> 18:19.199
Names, addresses,
phone numbers,

18:19.266 --> 18:22.001
W-9 forms,
it's all right here.

18:22.068 --> 18:23.203
I'm very good
with facts and figures.

18:23.270 --> 18:24.504
Excuse me.
Hi, hi, hi, hi.

18:24.571 --> 18:27.006
Excuse me.
I'm sorry, sorry, sorry.

18:27.073 --> 18:28.575
Oh, my goodness.
Hold on.

18:28.641 --> 18:31.444
- Okay. Hi, Shelly.
- Hello.

18:31.511 --> 18:34.347
- Good Yontif.
- Good Yontif to you.

18:38.951 --> 18:44.691
Hey, there, I'm Buzz.
Are you pumped for Yom Kippur?

18:44.757 --> 18:47.694
This is Buzzy Racklis.
He's on the temple board.

18:47.760 --> 18:49.562
And he used to be
an astronaut.

18:49.629 --> 18:50.963
Really?

18:51.030 --> 18:54.267
Actually, I was an attorney for
NASA on a single patent case.

18:54.334 --> 18:56.936
But I do own a rock
from the moon.

18:57.003 --> 18:58.271
[chuckles]

18:58.338 --> 19:01.441
Oh, my goodness.

19:09.382 --> 19:12.385
So how do you gals
know each other?

19:15.455 --> 19:18.825
Darling!
Darling!
Good Yontif!

19:18.891 --> 19:20.760
- Please, after you.
- Oh, my God.

19:20.827 --> 19:23.029
You look stunning,
but I don't like your hair.

19:23.095 --> 19:24.231
Say hello to my friend,

19:24.231 --> 19:25.898
the charming
and wonderful Buzz--

19:25.965 --> 19:28.968
Buzz Racklis.
Yes, this is Ali--

19:29.035 --> 19:30.837
Oh, my God!
This place!

19:30.903 --> 19:34.241
Oh! You look
so handsome!

19:34.241 --> 19:39.246
[overlapping chatter]

19:39.246 --> 19:43.850
[chatter continues]

19:43.916 --> 19:46.819
You look too thin.
Eat a bagel. Good Yontif.

19:46.886 --> 19:49.556
- Oh, my God. I'm so hungry.
- No, you have to wait
for the blessing.

19:49.622 --> 19:51.491
- I didn't know you fasted.
- I didn't.

19:51.558 --> 19:53.393
- Oh. I'll get the water.
- No, we're not serving water

19:53.460 --> 19:55.328
in solidarity
with the drought.

19:55.395 --> 19:58.064
There is wine on the table
if you're thirsty,
and skim milk.

19:58.130 --> 20:01.268
- Can we do the blessing?
- We're waiting for the rabbi.

20:01.334 --> 20:02.902
Josh, do we have
to wait for her?

20:02.969 --> 20:04.671
[chatter continues]

20:04.737 --> 20:06.406
No, we can go.

20:06.473 --> 20:08.441
So let's gather
around the table.

20:08.508 --> 20:10.243
Right there, please.

20:10.310 --> 20:12.245
[overlapping chatter]

20:12.312 --> 20:14.281
Shelly, you're
right there.

20:14.347 --> 20:16.215
Why am I so far away
from everybody?

20:16.283 --> 20:17.817
Oh, I'm with Buzz.
That's right.

20:17.884 --> 20:19.952
Okay. All right, we're
at the kiddy's table.

20:20.019 --> 20:21.988
Yes, we are.

20:22.054 --> 20:24.691
Oh, honey,
it looks beautiful.

20:24.757 --> 20:27.226
I would like to begin
by thanking everybody

20:27.294 --> 20:30.830
for coming to gather
at this table together.

20:30.897 --> 20:33.766
Um, I've just started--

20:33.833 --> 20:34.801
[inhales]

20:34.867 --> 20:36.836
...sort of investigating

20:36.903 --> 20:41.040
and wondering about
my Jewishness.

20:41.107 --> 20:43.009
And without Raquel here,

20:43.075 --> 20:47.113
I guess the blessing
is gonna be a little wonky.

20:47.179 --> 20:48.981
You're doing great.
Don't stop.

20:49.048 --> 20:51.250
Thank you, Buzz.

20:51.318 --> 20:54.954
So my understanding
of Yom Kippur is about

20:55.021 --> 20:57.757
this epic Yellow Pages

20:57.824 --> 21:00.327
that is called
the Book of Life.

21:00.393 --> 21:07.467
That is, God--
He, She, whatever great energy--

21:07.534 --> 21:10.470
- writes and seals--
- The energy,

21:10.537 --> 21:12.104
like, holds a pen?

21:12.171 --> 21:14.173
Are you done?

21:14.240 --> 21:15.174
- Yep.
- Okay.

21:15.241 --> 21:16.443
- Uh--
- Sorry.

21:16.509 --> 21:18.445
To get your name
in the Book of Life,

21:18.511 --> 21:21.247
you make apologies.

21:21.348 --> 21:23.783
And once it's in there
and sealed,

21:23.850 --> 21:27.019
that means that you get
to live another year.

21:27.086 --> 21:30.089
So I would like to say
that I'm sorry--

21:30.156 --> 21:33.460
- Maura: Oh, my God.
- ...for anything
I may have done

21:33.526 --> 21:36.195
to any of you this past year

21:36.262 --> 21:37.764
that caused you any pain.

21:37.830 --> 21:39.466
Maura:
That's beautiful.

21:39.532 --> 21:42.402
All apologies are accepted.

21:42.469 --> 21:45.638
- To a great new year.
- Yes.

21:45.705 --> 21:48.708
I'm sorry I was so controlling
with the parking space.

21:48.775 --> 21:53.380
So take a bagel
and hold it aloft.

21:53.413 --> 21:54.681
- Aloft.
- What?

21:54.747 --> 21:56.148
And aloft.

21:56.215 --> 21:58.885
Does anybody know the blessing?

21:58.951 --> 22:02.121
Oh, my God.
We don't even know
the blessing?

22:02.188 --> 22:04.223
He volunteers at the shul.

22:04.290 --> 22:06.759
[all speaking Hebrew]

22:16.268 --> 22:17.937
Buzz:
Beautiful, beautiful.

22:18.004 --> 22:21.408
- Happy Yom Kippur.
- Buzz: Now it's official.

22:21.441 --> 22:22.875
You don't say
"Happy Yom Kippur."

22:22.942 --> 22:24.877
- You say "Good Yontif!"
- Good Yontif!

22:24.944 --> 22:26.579
- Good Yontif!
- Good Yontif!

22:26.646 --> 22:29.416
[chatter continues]

22:29.482 --> 22:31.684
Canter's coleslaw,
the best.

22:31.751 --> 22:33.953
[all talking at once]

22:37.824 --> 22:39.225
This is good!

22:39.291 --> 22:40.427
Good job.
I don't know.

22:40.493 --> 22:43.730
Hey, Josh, you want
a different bagel?

22:43.796 --> 22:47.166
Do you want my everything?
No, seriously.

22:47.233 --> 22:48.601
You know, come on,
sun's down.

22:48.668 --> 22:50.703
- I like this.
- He's waiting for Raquel.

22:50.770 --> 22:52.639
Shelly:
It's okay, sweetheart, if you
want to wait for Raquel.

22:52.705 --> 22:54.641
[overlapping chatter continues]

22:54.707 --> 22:56.042
Buzz:
So where's the rabbi?

22:56.108 --> 22:59.211
Josh, when is Raquel
getting here?

22:59.278 --> 23:04.250
Um, guys,
Raquel's not coming.

23:04.316 --> 23:06.553
- No.
- I should probably say,

23:06.619 --> 23:08.688
uh, we broke up.

23:08.755 --> 23:10.957
And there is no baby.

23:11.023 --> 23:14.326
The pregnancy is not--
was not viable.

23:14.461 --> 23:16.896
Um, it was kind of like
a false-start thing.

23:16.963 --> 23:20.633
So we-- One thing
led to another.

23:20.700 --> 23:23.102
We are not together.
So--

23:25.104 --> 23:27.139
It's fine. Honestly,
it's for the better.

23:27.206 --> 23:30.376
I'm-- I'm-- I'm--
This is a new begining for me.

23:30.477 --> 23:33.045
So let's just move on.

23:33.112 --> 23:34.814
Oh, sorry.

23:34.881 --> 23:38.384
[sobbing]

23:38.485 --> 23:41.488
- Shelly.
- Shelly.

23:41.488 --> 23:43.790
- Shh!
- Mommy, don't do this.

23:43.856 --> 23:46.626
Mom! Mom!
This is not yours!

23:46.693 --> 23:47.660
- Oh, my God.
- Stop!

23:47.727 --> 23:49.195
It's not your fault.

23:49.261 --> 23:51.864
I was drunk at the wedding,
and I told everybody--

23:51.931 --> 23:54.834
It's not about you!
It's not about--

23:54.901 --> 23:57.036
I told everybody
to celebrate it.

23:57.103 --> 23:59.205
I brought out the evil eye,
and I killed the baby.

23:59.271 --> 24:01.641
- Yeah, you killed the baby.
- You didn't kill the baby.

24:01.708 --> 24:03.510
- Stop it!
- Nobody killed the baby!

24:03.510 --> 24:05.612
- Jesus! It happens!
- [Shelly sobbing]

24:05.678 --> 24:07.514
Listen, my mother
was just like you

24:07.547 --> 24:08.948
with kina horas
and the evil eye,

24:09.015 --> 24:11.183
and [spits],
and you know what?

24:11.250 --> 24:13.119
It's all just bullshit.

24:13.185 --> 24:18.591
Good stuff happens.
Bad stuff happens.

24:18.658 --> 24:24.063
- Mom, just eat, please.
- Just breathe, Mom.

24:24.130 --> 24:26.533
- Eat something,
you'll feel better.
- Drink first.

24:26.566 --> 24:29.536
Hey, Josh. Joshie--

24:31.538 --> 24:33.405
It's okay to be sad.

24:33.540 --> 24:35.542
It's sad.

24:35.575 --> 24:39.178
[Shelly moaning]

24:39.245 --> 24:41.814
I don't need your permission.

24:41.881 --> 24:46.018
Oh, honey...

24:46.085 --> 24:48.254
I'm always afraid
I'm gonna die.
I'm always afraid

24:48.320 --> 24:49.922
I'm gonna make
somebody else die.

24:49.989 --> 24:52.458
Oh, no, Shelly,
no one's dying.

24:52.559 --> 24:54.460
You're not the--
[speaks Hebrew]

24:54.561 --> 24:56.696
You're not that powerful.

24:56.763 --> 24:59.699
Look, let me drive
you home, okay?

24:59.766 --> 25:02.602
You drive at night?

25:02.669 --> 25:04.571
