WEBVTT

00:48.966 --> 00:51.515
There's just a lot
at stake here, you know?

00:53.136 --> 00:56.060
We're talkin' nation versus nation,

00:56.223 --> 00:59.352
and the race is still on.

01:00.644 --> 01:03.523
There's lots to discover
out there, man.

01:03.689 --> 01:06.568
I guess the call came in
on a Friday.

01:06.733 --> 01:09.031
Nate and I were
at Ben's for a barbecue.

01:09.194 --> 01:12.994
Um... Just a few beers,
you know, maybe more than a few.

01:13.699 --> 01:16.452
With Ben's cooking,
you definitely need a few.

01:18.203 --> 01:19.625
Nate took the call.
It was Milton,

01:19.788 --> 01:23.838
and Milton said 18 was back on,

01:24.001 --> 01:28.427
but it was classified, DOD, top secret.

01:28.589 --> 01:30.683
Asked, you know,
"Are you OK with that?"

01:30.841 --> 01:33.640
And he was like,
"Are you kidding me?"

01:34.636 --> 01:37.515
I come from a family
of military pilots.

01:37.681 --> 01:40.685
Duty can sometimes
outbalance a private life.

01:40.851 --> 01:44.151
Make choices,
keep moving forward.

01:44.313 --> 01:47.317
NASA already has something
like 800 pounds of rocks.

01:47.482 --> 01:52.079
So why we need more, I don't know, but,
hey, if it means a trip to the moon...

01:52.863 --> 01:56.743
Placing cameras. We got these
Westinghouses all over the place.

01:56.908 --> 01:59.878
Well, I think the way it's being
explained is they're using

02:00.037 --> 02:04.463
a Saturn V to launch
a classified DOD payload, uh,

02:04.625 --> 02:08.846
which is meant to be very large,
very heavy, and, uh...

02:10.380 --> 02:12.599
...apparently unmanned.

02:14.134 --> 02:15.351
Apparently.

02:15.510 --> 02:18.138
Placing these
high-frequency transmitters.

02:18.305 --> 02:21.309
Part of some early warning
antimissile defense system

02:21.475 --> 02:22.567
against the Soviet Union.

02:22.726 --> 02:26.230
These PSD5s are kind of like
high-tech radar scanners,

02:26.396 --> 02:29.741
they should pick up and track
anything we can't.

02:29.900 --> 02:32.574
Gotta keep a little eye
on the Russians, there.

02:32.736 --> 02:34.613
Would've been nice
to tell my wife.

02:36.406 --> 02:39.034
Laura had been by my side
the whole time, and, uh...

02:39.201 --> 02:42.705
...she thinks I'm off doing a training
exercise with the Japanese space agency.

02:43.497 --> 02:46.922
Ryan, my boy, would've been nice to tell
him his old man's goin' to the moon.

02:47.084 --> 02:49.553
I would've loved to have
brought him a souvenir.

02:49.711 --> 02:52.760
Maybe a moon rock.
I don't know. Maybe one day.

02:53.924 --> 02:55.847
Ban was always first in class,

02:56.009 --> 02:57.477
and I was always right at his heels.

02:58.887 --> 03:01.390
Yeah, I'll admit, I'm a little jealous
that he'll be moon-walkin' with Nate

03:01.556 --> 03:04.309
while I'll be all by my
lonesome, piloting the orbiter.

03:04.476 --> 03:08.356
My job is, essentially, to make
sure I bring us home safely.

03:09.106 --> 03:12.610
Look, let's face it, these
missions are result-oriented,

03:12.776 --> 03:16.451
and, uh, we can't afford
to fail here, now can we?

03:16.613 --> 03:19.287
Things can go wrong,
things do go wrong, it happens,

03:19.449 --> 03:21.952
but you just gotta push
that out of your mind.

03:23.537 --> 03:25.460
It's just not an option.

03:27.082 --> 03:29.255
I'm proud to do it
for these guys.

03:29.418 --> 03:31.841
And I'm proud to do it
for my country.

03:33.714 --> 03:38.220
T- minus
ten, nine, eight, seven,

03:38.385 --> 03:43.437
six, five, four, three...

03:43.598 --> 03:46.477
...two, one.

04:03.034 --> 04:05.662
Apollo 18, you're looking good.

04:09.082 --> 04:12.177
Christmas lights.

04:12.335 --> 04:14.929
- Bring any Christmas lights, Ben?
- Nope, not me.

04:15.088 --> 04:17.682
You ever see anything
like that before?

04:17.841 --> 04:19.012
No, sir.

04:19.885 --> 04:21.432
It's amazing.

04:24.681 --> 04:26.524
Earth in all her glory.

04:28.226 --> 04:31.196
That's a good-lookin' boy.
You sure he's yours?

04:31.354 --> 04:34.153
Watch it. He's a good kid.

04:34.316 --> 04:36.034
He's got big shoes to fill now.

04:36.193 --> 04:37.740
Big ol' moon boots.

04:39.446 --> 04:42.245
So, Nate, you wait all this time
to put your foot on the moon,

04:42.407 --> 04:46.378
and you get to be number 13.
How you feel about that?

04:46.536 --> 04:48.664
You gonna be OK
with staying behind, John?

04:50.123 --> 04:52.842
Oh, you know, it'd be nice
to have some alone time.

04:53.001 --> 04:55.174
It's gettin' crowded in here.

04:55.337 --> 04:59.092
I'll keep a light on for you,
boys. Don't stay out too late now.

04:59.257 --> 05:01.635
See you in
a couple of days, partner.

05:01.802 --> 05:04.601
Roger that.
See you in a couple days.

05:15.357 --> 05:18.577
Houston, this is Freedom
preparing to undock Liberty. Over.

05:20.403 --> 05:23.202
OK, 18, you're
go for undock in four minutes.

05:24.908 --> 05:26.956
John, is the tunnel vented?

05:27.494 --> 05:29.917
Roger that. Tunnel is vented.

05:30.914 --> 05:32.416
OK, Liberty,
we're ready to send you

05:32.582 --> 05:34.129
an updated state vector and REFSMMAT.

05:34.292 --> 05:38.638
Roger, Houston. We're pooling
data. Computer is all yours.

05:40.257 --> 05:41.930
Wish you were
comin' with us, John.

05:45.303 --> 05:46.930
Now, you boys
be careful down there.

05:47.097 --> 05:49.145
You, too, buddy.

05:49.307 --> 05:50.433
Got a good visual on you.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.694
OK, 18, you are go for landing.

05:53.728 --> 05:55.822
We're go for the moon!

05:57.023 --> 05:59.196
Fourteen hundred feet.

05:59.359 --> 06:02.078
Forty-four down, lookin' good.

06:02.237 --> 06:04.114
Down to a thousand feet.

06:04.281 --> 06:06.033
We're right on profile.

06:08.785 --> 06:10.537
Fifty-four LPD. Dropping off

06:10.704 --> 06:14.550
Seven hundred feet.
Down 20. Looking good.

06:15.667 --> 06:20.389
Mission Elapsed Time: four days,
six hours, 33 minutes.

06:21.298 --> 06:22.720
Roger.

06:24.634 --> 06:26.557
Leveling off Take her down.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.814
- Gonna have to land long.
- Where?

06:28.972 --> 06:31.066
Over that next crater.
Twelve o'clock.

06:31.224 --> 06:34.068
Next to the rim.
It's a pretty rocky area. Mark it.

06:36.146 --> 06:39.696
Four hundred and 30 feet.
Down 15, 25 forward.

06:41.443 --> 06:42.490
Houston, we have

06:42.652 --> 06:44.905
a program alarm. Twelve-oh-one.

06:45.071 --> 06:46.664
You are go
on the twelve-oh-one, Liberty.

06:46.823 --> 06:48.825
Roger. Go twelve-oh-one.

06:48.992 --> 06:50.835
Liberty,
position vector mark one-eight.

06:50.994 --> 06:52.837
Watch those suppression boosters.

06:52.996 --> 06:55.124
You wanna think
about revisiting that approach?

06:55.290 --> 06:56.667
Negative, we'll miss our window.

06:56.833 --> 06:58.460
Those boulders are some big mothers.

06:58.627 --> 07:01.426
Sub boosters
on my three, two, one, mark.

07:01.588 --> 07:04.216
- Liberty status?
- We're comin' in too fast.

07:04.382 --> 07:05.759
Liberty, you stabilize.

07:06.509 --> 07:09.513
Liberty to Houston,
range is long. Going manual.

07:13.224 --> 07:16.569
- Contact light.
- Standby for T1 stay/no stay.

07:16.728 --> 07:20.699
- Engine arm off.
- Stay for T1, Liberty.

07:25.236 --> 07:27.204
Houston,
you give that man a cigar.

07:28.114 --> 07:30.412
From up here,
that looked very pretty.

07:30.575 --> 07:32.077
Excellent touchdown.

07:33.536 --> 07:35.630
Oh, are you talkin' to me or Nate?

07:36.873 --> 07:38.671
Well, I'm talking
to you both, Ben.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.461
December 25th, 1974.

07:41.628 --> 07:44.097
four days, nine hours,
23 minutes.

07:44.255 --> 07:46.883
Commander Nathan Walker.
DOD Mission Report One-A.

07:47.050 --> 07:50.896
We're day one of our two-day mission.
Prepping for EVA-One and payload setup.

07:51.054 --> 07:52.977
This is Thomas Young
at Apollo Mission Control.

07:53.139 --> 07:55.483
In addition to the Mauer
16-millimeter cameras,

07:55.642 --> 07:58.191
- this mission will mark...
- Looks like five reels,

07:58.353 --> 08:00.572
- 10,000 feet Kodachrome.
- The RCA module

08:00.730 --> 08:02.903
data acquisition cameras
inside the lunar module

08:03.066 --> 08:04.238
record all facets of the mission.

08:04.401 --> 08:05.903
Houston, we are
prepped for EVA-One.

08:06.069 --> 08:09.073
Copy, Liberty.
You are go for cabin depress.

08:12.659 --> 08:16.459
Button up good, boys. We don't
want anyone catching cold.

08:16.621 --> 08:18.248
Roger that.

08:20.291 --> 08:21.964
Can you check me over?

08:22.752 --> 08:25.551
It'd help if you
were a little smaller.

08:28.925 --> 08:30.768
- Check my PLSS.
- Yup.

08:36.433 --> 08:38.481
Houston...

08:40.020 --> 08:44.116
...we're taking our first steps
on the south pole.

08:47.277 --> 08:51.498
I prepared a speech, but no one
but us would hear it anyway.

08:53.199 --> 08:56.123
No words can describe
how it feels to be here.

08:58.079 --> 09:00.628
Rock formations everywhere.

09:00.790 --> 09:03.293
The sun is low, on the horizon.

09:03.460 --> 09:05.178
it's amazing.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.641
Freedom, do you read?

09:10.800 --> 09:11.972
...do you read?

09:12.135 --> 09:15.014
Freedom reads you loud
and clear, Liberty. Over.

09:23.646 --> 09:28.652
Yeah, yeah. Perfect.
You call that a salute?

09:28.818 --> 09:32.163
OK, let me get a shot of you
with the LM in the background.

09:33.907 --> 09:36.126
That looks like a Navy salute to me.

09:37.494 --> 09:40.213
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
I gotta get this.

09:41.289 --> 09:44.509
Promised Laura and Ryan
I'd spend Christmas with them.

09:44.667 --> 09:46.669
This is all goin' back
to the Department of Defense.

09:46.836 --> 09:48.179
No one's ever gonna...

09:48.797 --> 09:51.266
Completing Westinghouse setup.

09:55.095 --> 09:57.189
Sounds good, Nate.
Standing by.

10:00.809 --> 10:03.688
Motion sensor is tracking
you perfectly, Nate.

10:03.853 --> 10:07.357
Captain Video says first round
is on him when you get back.

10:12.195 --> 10:14.323
I'm checking
the payload in the MESA unit.

10:25.166 --> 10:26.918
Shit!

10:27.627 --> 10:29.095
What was that?

10:39.139 --> 10:41.392
Houston, can you track
that power flux?

10:41.558 --> 10:43.435
I'd like to get a fix
on the interference.

10:43.601 --> 10:46.354
Roger, Nate. Looks like you're
ready to proceed to location one

10:46.521 --> 10:49.570
- and initiate setup procedures.
- Copy. We're on our way.

10:51.609 --> 10:52.986
Will you take a look at that?

10:55.155 --> 10:57.283
It makes you think, doesn't it?

10:59.784 --> 11:01.707
Damn, it's dusty.

11:01.870 --> 11:04.965
I'm leaving the camera up here
so you can get a better view, Tommy.

11:05.123 --> 11:06.841
And for your information,

11:07.000 --> 11:10.095
we're about three hours
and 20 minutes...

11:14.716 --> 11:18.721
it's hard to believe the sun never
shines in some of these places. Ever.

11:23.141 --> 11:26.270
Careful, now, fellas.
You drop into any of those craters,

11:26.436 --> 11:27.779
you'll get cold in a hurry.

11:32.775 --> 11:34.618
PSD5 in place.

11:34.777 --> 11:37.121
Roger.
Proceed with startup.

11:37.280 --> 11:40.284
Did you record the signal
frequency on the PSD5 during training?

11:40.450 --> 11:43.499
- It was ALSEP, wasn't it?
- Thought it was.

11:45.788 --> 11:47.961
I think they changed it.

11:48.124 --> 11:51.219
Set astral coordinates,
four-eight-point-three on the Z

11:51.377 --> 11:53.721
and eight-niner-point-eight
on... Record.

11:53.880 --> 11:56.599
Initiation sequence complete.

12:04.349 --> 12:07.102
Houston, we're getting some noise
on the high-gain again.

12:09.187 --> 12:15.115
Collecting geological samples near
what appears to be a... impact crater.

12:18.488 --> 12:20.536
The sample feels...

12:22.492 --> 12:24.085
...strange.

12:39.008 --> 12:40.931
it's great
to get out of that gear.

12:42.095 --> 12:44.974
four days,
14 hours, 48 minutes.

12:45.139 --> 12:48.860
Commander Nathan Walker.
DOD Mission Report Three-Charlie.

12:49.018 --> 12:50.816
Day one, EVA-One complete.

12:53.022 --> 12:57.118
I am starving.
What's on the menu tonight?

12:57.277 --> 12:59.530
Carrots or peas?

12:59.696 --> 13:01.164
I'll take carrots.

13:01.322 --> 13:04.246
- No. You get the peas.
- Perfect.

13:07.870 --> 13:10.214
I'm mighty proud of you, boys.

13:10.873 --> 13:13.376
- You have a good time out there?
- You know it.

13:14.085 --> 13:15.712
I'm gettin' a lot of noise
on this frequency.

13:15.878 --> 13:19.883
I'm gonna see if I can isolate it,
maybe clean it up a bit.

13:21.592 --> 13:22.969
Roger that.

13:32.478 --> 13:36.949
Astronaut Ryan Anderson
with his dad, flying through space.

13:38.443 --> 13:40.662
- Ryan, what are you doing?
- Just playing, Mom.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.788
Don't play
with your dad's stuff

13:43.781 --> 13:44.907
Baby, is that recording?

13:45.074 --> 13:47.122
Sorry, Dad. Love you.

13:50.288 --> 13:54.168
Beverly's in a panic because
a hair appointment ran over.

13:54.334 --> 13:56.428
Stan and Jean are already over
and nothing's ready,

13:56.586 --> 13:59.965
so I offer to help cut
all these jalapenos.

14:00.131 --> 14:02.850
Couple of minutes later,
I'm in the bathroom takin' a leak

14:03.009 --> 14:05.762
with all this jalapeno nonsense
on my hands.

14:05.928 --> 14:09.353
Next thing I know,
my crotch is on fire.

14:09.515 --> 14:12.769
So I'm in the bathroom,
hollering in pain.

14:12.935 --> 14:15.404
- And they can hear you?
- Oh, oh, they heard me.

14:15.563 --> 14:18.612
And Stan's wife's a nurse,
so she sends me back into the bathroom

14:18.775 --> 14:21.028
- with a cup of milk.
- Nate, I gotta stop you.

14:21.194 --> 14:23.617
You're not about to tell me that you
dipped your balls in a glass of milk?

14:23.780 --> 14:28.126
- Hey, don't knock it. It works.
- Jalapeno dick.

14:28.284 --> 14:30.286
I can't believe you
haven't heard that story.

14:30.453 --> 14:34.299
- Is Beverly back in Miami?
- Yeah. So I hear.

14:34.457 --> 14:37.131
You realize she divorced
you because you snore, right?

14:37.293 --> 14:39.887
- I don't snore.
- Yeah.

14:40.963 --> 14:42.715
Every time.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.552
- You all right, Benny?
- Yeah, I'm good.

14:45.718 --> 14:47.971
- You bang your head?
- Again.

14:48.137 --> 14:49.639
It's a big head.

14:49.806 --> 14:52.309
Thanks for the housekeeping,
guys. Great first day.

14:52.475 --> 14:55.069
We'll miss you over at Marybelle's.
Get some sleep.

14:55.228 --> 14:56.400
Good night, JD.

14:56.562 --> 14:58.781
Never should have
told you that. You little prick.

15:54.328 --> 15:56.501
- Nate?
- Yeah, I hear it.

15:57.832 --> 15:59.880
What can that be here?

16:00.042 --> 16:01.544
Give me a second.

16:02.753 --> 16:06.178
It should be on comm?

16:06.340 --> 16:09.435
What's that?

16:09.594 --> 16:10.937
Right.

16:14.348 --> 16:16.316
- You hear that?
- Yeah.

16:20.396 --> 16:22.569
All right. Uh...

16:30.573 --> 16:32.746
Sounds like it's
coming from up here.

16:36.162 --> 16:39.166
That doesn't sound right.

16:40.416 --> 16:41.918
Can't find it down here.

16:42.084 --> 16:47.807
Tommy, you think this interference could
be coming from the PSD5 setup?

16:47.965 --> 16:52.687
We don't see anything obvious.
We'll double-check with DOD.

17:01.771 --> 17:05.195
We'll look into it.
Go get some sleep.

17:56.409 --> 18:00.334
I'm up! You can turn off the noise.

18:01.247 --> 18:02.624
Good morning, Liberty.

18:02.790 --> 18:05.009
We took care of the interference
a couple hours ago.

18:05.167 --> 18:10.139
You guys should be OK.
Let's get ready for EVA-Two, OK?

18:15.553 --> 18:19.478
five days,
eight hours, 34 minutes.

18:19.640 --> 18:21.517
IMP Ben Anderson.

18:22.602 --> 18:24.604
I gotta document this.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.448
Now, Nate...

18:27.607 --> 18:29.985
Nate says he never snores in his sleep.

18:30.151 --> 18:31.698
Now I got proof.

18:40.369 --> 18:42.337
Ha!

18:47.209 --> 18:49.678
Well, boys, I just wanna let
you know that Freedom will be going

18:49.837 --> 18:51.714
around the corner to the backside.

18:51.881 --> 18:54.600
- No comm for a while.
- Roger that.

18:59.639 --> 19:01.937
Hey, I made you breakfast.

19:02.099 --> 19:03.726
What do I got today?

19:03.893 --> 19:08.069
- Scrambled eggs.
- Oh, again. What do you got?

19:08.230 --> 19:11.154
I'm going with
the delicious ham spread.

19:12.360 --> 19:14.328
- Hm.
- It's all yours.

19:15.321 --> 19:17.699
Just like Mom makes.

19:22.370 --> 19:23.997
Hey, did you remove
one of my samples?

19:24.163 --> 19:25.130
Huh?

19:25.289 --> 19:27.383
Look, one of my samples
is on the floor.

19:32.088 --> 19:34.432
What's that doing there, Ben?

19:36.425 --> 19:38.052
I don't know.

19:38.594 --> 19:40.688
I bagged and tagged everything.

19:45.935 --> 19:47.232
- Look, uh...
- It's gotta go back in.

19:47.395 --> 19:48.567
Yeah, grab me the scoop.

19:53.734 --> 19:55.953
I'm going to have to mark
this one contaminated.

19:56.862 --> 19:58.785
I don't understand.
How did it get there?

19:58.948 --> 20:01.576
- I don't know.
- No, really, Ben, how'd that get there?

20:01.742 --> 20:03.790
I don't know.

20:14.130 --> 20:15.723
DOD is checking
on the interference

20:15.881 --> 20:17.474
with the first payload setup.

20:17.633 --> 20:20.637
Run a diagnostic...

20:21.971 --> 20:24.099
Houston? Do you copy?

20:26.016 --> 20:27.268
I think we lost them.

20:27.435 --> 20:29.062
Probably got
some comm blockage.

20:29.228 --> 20:31.230
These are some big craters.

20:31.397 --> 20:34.571
Five days, ten hours,
40 minutes since liftoff.

20:34.734 --> 20:37.908
Commander Nathan Walker.
We're on EVA-Two.

20:38.070 --> 20:40.823
Initiating day two receiver setup.

20:47.538 --> 20:50.587
Activating PSD5 transmission signal.

20:52.668 --> 20:56.673
Houston, do you copy?
This is Liberty, over.

20:58.215 --> 20:59.808
Still down.

21:01.093 --> 21:03.892
There is something
with that frequency.

21:04.054 --> 21:08.434
Comm shouldn't be cuttin' out
like that, not for this length of time.

21:08.601 --> 21:10.319
Where are you goin'?

21:12.688 --> 21:14.861
What the hell?

21:15.024 --> 21:16.697
- Nate.
- What is it?

21:19.195 --> 21:20.742
Tracks.

21:21.864 --> 21:23.332
What?

21:26.744 --> 21:28.838
No, that's impossible.

21:30.372 --> 21:31.999
These aren't ours.

21:34.043 --> 21:38.173
five days,
11 hours, seven minutes.

21:38.339 --> 21:40.182
IMP Anderson.

21:42.927 --> 21:45.646
Tracks appear in single...

21:47.681 --> 21:50.480
Houston, this is 18.
Do you copy?

21:55.189 --> 21:58.568
Houston, this is 18. Do you read?

21:59.652 --> 22:03.031
John's on the backside.
No comm from him, either.

22:05.616 --> 22:06.868
Well, let's see where they lead.

22:08.994 --> 22:10.496
Impact crater.

22:10.663 --> 22:12.836
You feel that?

22:12.998 --> 22:15.467
Yeah. Temperature dropped.

22:19.588 --> 22:21.090
Look at the footprints.

22:22.550 --> 22:24.769
It doesn't make sense.

22:24.927 --> 22:27.430
I think he was
just walking in circles.

22:28.597 --> 22:30.315
Disoriented.

22:35.062 --> 22:38.282
- Oxygen dep?
- I don't know.

22:38.440 --> 22:40.067
They go off in this direction.

22:45.030 --> 22:46.623
Get up here!

22:58.711 --> 23:00.554
Holy shit.

23:09.138 --> 23:10.731
it's Russian.

23:11.765 --> 23:13.483
What the hell?

23:26.113 --> 23:29.413
How could there be Russians
on the moon and nobody knows about it?

23:34.872 --> 23:38.126
We're on the moon
and nobody knows about us.

23:39.460 --> 23:41.258
Something's not right.

23:45.716 --> 23:47.718
I'm gonna look inside.

24:00.606 --> 24:02.358
Lights are off.

24:28.550 --> 24:30.678
Somebody lost it in here.

24:33.847 --> 24:35.770
This place is trashed.

24:40.729 --> 24:43.448
Their systems aren't
that different from ours.

24:47.778 --> 24:52.079
Powers up.
Oxygen reserves are good.

24:52.241 --> 24:54.835
Can't tell if she's
fully operational, though.

24:58.872 --> 25:01.045
- Where the hell did they go?
- I don't know.

25:02.835 --> 25:04.883
I'm gonna take a look around.

25:05.045 --> 25:06.763
But stay close.

25:06.922 --> 25:09.016
Those Russians could be anywhere.

25:14.847 --> 25:16.645
What the hell?

25:19.351 --> 25:22.230
There's blood. A lot of it.

25:25.107 --> 25:27.030
Somebody got hurt pretty bad.

25:31.363 --> 25:32.956
I don't like this.

25:42.708 --> 25:45.302
I think I see something
inside the crater.

25:50.674 --> 25:52.472
I'm goin' down.

25:57.389 --> 26:00.984
Wait, Ben. The suits
aren't ready for that kind of cold.

26:02.311 --> 26:04.985
It's OK,
the crater isn't so deep.

26:06.398 --> 26:09.823
it's so cold.

26:12.112 --> 26:13.489
I just see rocks.

26:15.407 --> 26:18.752
The ground, it's, uh...
it's different.

26:19.703 --> 26:23.003
It feels... softer.

26:24.541 --> 26:26.009
Get out of there.

26:33.884 --> 26:35.602
Oh, God...

26:38.722 --> 26:40.520
So cold.

26:42.935 --> 26:45.939
Get out of there! Ben!

26:46.105 --> 26:49.075
OK, yeah, all right.
I'm headin' back up.

26:49.233 --> 26:52.282
Holy shit!

26:53.654 --> 26:56.373
I found him!
I got the cosmonaut!

26:56.532 --> 27:01.003
it's OK. I'm all right.
I'm on my way up!

27:06.834 --> 27:09.713
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm warmin' up.

27:10.879 --> 27:13.177
Oh, Christ.
What the hell happened here?

27:14.508 --> 27:16.510
Maybe the other cosmonaut?

27:17.719 --> 27:19.642
You think he killed him?

27:24.101 --> 27:25.648
There's a rip.

27:28.272 --> 27:31.071
What are you doing?
Get your hand out of there.

27:33.193 --> 27:34.570
Wait a minute,
there's something...

27:34.736 --> 27:36.613
Get away from him!

27:36.780 --> 27:38.578
What the hell was that?

27:48.917 --> 27:50.760
It was a rock.

27:51.837 --> 27:54.340
Must have happened
when I was dragging him out.

27:54.506 --> 27:56.850
- I don't know.
- Let's get out of here.

27:59.678 --> 28:01.601
All right, we're almost
at the point of no return, Ben.

28:01.763 --> 28:03.731
If we don't go now,
we'll end up just as dead.

28:10.564 --> 28:12.362
I don't like this.
Someone died up here...

28:12.524 --> 28:14.242
Enough.

28:24.453 --> 28:26.501
This is a secure line.

28:26.663 --> 28:28.961
I'm just talking to you, right,
Tommy?

28:29.124 --> 28:30.717
That's affirmative, Nate.

28:32.002 --> 28:34.721
The Russians have been to the moon.

28:34.880 --> 28:36.598
Say again?

28:36.757 --> 28:39.510
The Russians have landed
on the south pole.

28:39.676 --> 28:42.475
We found their LK Proton Lander,

28:42.638 --> 28:45.357
but it didn't end well
for the cosmonaut.

28:45.515 --> 28:49.190
- You find a crash site?
- They didn't crash.

28:51.271 --> 28:53.114
We found his body in a crater.

28:53.690 --> 28:56.318
You found a dead cosmonaut?

28:56.485 --> 28:58.328
You tellin' me you didn't know this?

28:59.780 --> 29:03.375
We land less than two clicks
from a Soviet LK,

29:03.533 --> 29:06.207
and you expect me to believe
you didn't know they were here?

29:08.163 --> 29:11.463
You know they scrubbed their
manned flight program in'69,

29:11.625 --> 29:13.502
That's the official word.

29:15.712 --> 29:17.510
Did you know they were here?

29:21.718 --> 29:24.346
- Tommy?
- This is a DOD mission, Nate.

29:24.513 --> 29:27.517
I'm just briefed in on what I need
to know. That's all I can tell you.

29:27.683 --> 29:32.359
You get that little prick
from DOD to give me a call.

29:32.521 --> 29:36.697
Get some rest. I'll get the DOD
over here and we'll talk to you soon.

29:39.611 --> 29:41.864
- Tommy's a straight shooter.
- No.

29:42.030 --> 29:44.533
I knew something was wrong
from the beginning.

29:44.700 --> 29:46.452
All right, what are you thinking?

29:46.618 --> 29:50.168
DOD takin' over,
lyin' to our families.

29:50.330 --> 29:51.877
Then they're rushing us
up here for what?

29:52.040 --> 29:54.293
What, to set up
some listening devices?

29:54.459 --> 29:57.929
Yeah. Makes no sense.

29:58.088 --> 30:00.841
Come on, think about Watergate, Nate.
I mean, that was our president,

30:01.008 --> 30:05.479
for Christ sakes, and you don't think
that DOD would just lie to us?

30:05.637 --> 30:07.810
So, what are we
doing up here then?

30:08.890 --> 30:11.393
What are we really doing?

30:14.646 --> 30:18.526
Well,
it's kind of spooky, really.

30:21.611 --> 30:23.955
Strange beauty on the backside.

30:25.741 --> 30:28.164
I don't know if it's my
mind playin' tricks on me,

30:28.327 --> 30:31.331
but every so often you look
out these little windows and...

30:31.496 --> 30:34.841
...get this sense that something
might be lookin' back...

30:35.000 --> 30:36.593
...back at you.

32:34.828 --> 32:36.580
Nate, look at this.

32:36.746 --> 32:38.419
- What?
- Look at this!

32:39.291 --> 32:40.884
The flag's gone.

32:45.172 --> 32:46.594
No, this isn't right.

32:46.756 --> 32:49.100
Houston, this is 18, over.

32:49.968 --> 32:52.016
Houston, Liberty.

32:52.179 --> 32:55.399
Did you see anything unusual
on the Westinghouse last night?

32:56.850 --> 32:59.979
Uh... We got some
interference and dropouts.

33:00.604 --> 33:02.402
Our flag is gone.

33:03.315 --> 33:04.692
Say again?

33:08.028 --> 33:09.575
Say again.

33:14.576 --> 33:17.079
Maybe the other cosmonaut took it.

33:17.245 --> 33:21.716
If there was another cosmonaut,
he'd be away from his LK for, what,

33:21.875 --> 33:24.719
a minimum of ten, 12 hours?

33:25.837 --> 33:28.215
- What are you thinkin', John?
- There's no way.

33:28.381 --> 33:30.429
He couldn't carry that kind of oxygen.

33:30.592 --> 33:32.435
So how could he survive?

33:33.512 --> 33:35.105
Maybe there is no he.

33:35.263 --> 33:37.436
You saying the Soviets
flew a one-man mission?

33:37.599 --> 33:39.567
Wouldn't be the first time.

33:39.726 --> 33:43.321
If there's one cosmonaut,
who took the flag?

33:43.480 --> 33:46.108
Who killed the other cosmonaut
that we found?

33:46.274 --> 33:49.494
We need to get
DOD on the line. Now.

33:49.653 --> 33:53.829
We suspected the Soviets might
be there, but we had no confirmation.

33:53.990 --> 33:56.163
Intelligence warned that they
might be disguising missions

33:56.326 --> 34:00.627
- as routine satellite launches.
- Why the hell didn't you tell us?

34:00.789 --> 34:04.760
National security. We play our cards
pretty close to the vest, Commander.

34:04.918 --> 34:06.295
I'm sure you can understand.

34:07.963 --> 34:09.636
Maybe a little too close.

34:11.257 --> 34:14.558
We were concerned they might get
their eye in the sky up there first.

34:14.719 --> 34:16.938
It would be
a national security disaster.

34:17.097 --> 34:19.315
So where the hell's
this other cosmonaut?

34:20.559 --> 34:23.402
What, they're just
gonna leave him here?

34:23.562 --> 34:26.690
Our intelligence suggests
there was only one cosmonaut.

34:26.856 --> 34:28.858
- Goddamn!
- Setup's complete.

34:29.025 --> 34:31.369
It's time to get
you boys home again.

34:33.321 --> 34:34.994
So that's it?

34:38.284 --> 34:40.629
Let's focus on getting home.
We'll ask questions later.

34:44.081 --> 34:47.052
Zero-four-seven, plus three.

34:47.210 --> 34:51.215
- Seven-seven-six-two.
- Your RCS feed is looking good.

34:51.380 --> 34:52.974
...minus seven-six.

34:55.135 --> 34:57.388
What the hell was that?

34:57.554 --> 34:59.431
Let's get outta here.

35:00.348 --> 35:02.442
Roger. DAP looks good.

35:02.601 --> 35:04.444
Ten seconds.

35:04.603 --> 35:07.573
- Ten seconds. Ready on my mark.
- Ten, nine...

35:07.731 --> 35:11.076
- Time to go home.
- ...eight, seven, six...

35:22.370 --> 35:24.998
Master alarm!

35:25.165 --> 35:27.133
Shit! We are no go!
We are no go!

35:27.292 --> 35:28.794
- Safe this damn thing.
- I'm trying!

35:28.960 --> 35:32.089
- I've got a major power glitch.
- We're losing the descent oxygen.

35:32.255 --> 35:34.132
- We got a leak somewhere!
- I'm gonna try and isolate the tanks

35:34.299 --> 35:36.643
and see if I can stop it.
Houston, do you copy?

35:36.801 --> 35:39.020
- Repeat, Houston, do you copy?
- Engine arm off!

35:39.179 --> 35:42.854
We've lost comm.
Prop valves, closed.

35:43.016 --> 35:45.439
- No, no, no, no, no, no...
- What the hell is going on?

35:45.602 --> 35:48.776
No. Houston, this is Liberty. Over.

36:09.042 --> 36:11.215
We just lost communications.

36:14.589 --> 36:18.093
- How the hell did that happen?
- I don't know.

36:18.259 --> 36:20.933
Impact on the LM, maybe a meteorite?

36:21.096 --> 36:22.973
There's no way to tell
without going EVA.

36:23.723 --> 36:27.023
- Give me a hand with the PLSS.
- You sure about this?

36:27.185 --> 36:31.110
We need comm to get home.
Can't just stay in here and wait.

36:32.399 --> 36:34.242
- Look, I can play with the omni...
- Suit up!

36:36.820 --> 36:38.822
Leaving egress platform.

36:40.281 --> 36:41.533
Stepping down the ladder.

36:43.618 --> 36:45.495
six days...

36:46.996 --> 36:49.124
...13 hours, 46 minutes.

36:50.709 --> 36:54.054
Commander Walker is performing
an unscheduled EVA

36:54.212 --> 36:56.761
to repair the S-Band antenna
on the Rover.

36:58.341 --> 37:00.264
We've experienced...

37:00.427 --> 37:03.351
We've experienced some
unexplained, uh... malfunctions.

37:10.061 --> 37:12.735
Looks like the hull's
insulation is damaged.

37:14.816 --> 37:18.741
Could be debris from the impact,
but I don't see any meteor residue.

37:25.660 --> 37:28.834
- This is ripped to pieces.
- Something hit us?

37:28.997 --> 37:30.294
I can't tell.

37:30.457 --> 37:33.336
We get that same feedback
each time we use active comm.

37:33.501 --> 37:35.378
Sounds like crossover
chatter from another frequency.

37:35.545 --> 37:38.845
I can't squelch it.
I've never heard anything like it.

37:39.007 --> 37:40.850
Wait, wait.

37:47.599 --> 37:50.569
Nate, talk to me.
What do you see?

37:50.727 --> 37:52.525
Looks like tracks.

37:53.188 --> 37:56.533
Footprints? Maybe there
is another cosmonaut.

37:56.691 --> 37:57.943
No.

38:01.070 --> 38:03.823
six days,
13 hours, 47 minutes.

38:03.990 --> 38:05.913
Commander Nathan Walker.

38:06.075 --> 38:08.794
We're witnessing
what could be evidence...

38:09.329 --> 38:11.957
...of extraterrestrial contact.

38:12.123 --> 38:13.966
We're witnessing
what could be evidence

38:14.125 --> 38:16.503
of extraterrestrial contact.

38:18.505 --> 38:20.473
Do you know what you're saying?

38:21.883 --> 38:24.306
These tracks are not human.

38:27.680 --> 38:30.103
I found the flag.

38:30.266 --> 38:32.314
It's shredded.

38:32.477 --> 38:35.151
And the motion-sensor camera is gone.

38:37.482 --> 38:40.326
S- Band looks OK, just got knocked.

38:41.653 --> 38:43.781
I'm turning the Rover back up.

38:58.294 --> 39:02.765
Connection looks good.
Try to reach Houston or Freedom.

39:05.927 --> 39:07.725
Freedom, copy.

39:08.847 --> 39:12.977
Houston, do you copy?

39:14.602 --> 39:17.401
Damn it. No, look, it's not working.

39:17.564 --> 39:19.362
All right, let me try something.

39:32.161 --> 39:37.383
Wait. Something's...
Something's moving. Something's moving.

39:37.542 --> 39:40.045
What? I don't see anything.

39:40.211 --> 39:43.966
Something in... inside my suit!

39:46.926 --> 39:48.928
It's in my helmet!

39:49.095 --> 39:51.189
Nate, listen to me.
Get back to the LM!

39:51.347 --> 39:54.647
- I can't get it out!
- Nate, come back to the LM, OK? Nate?

39:54.809 --> 39:56.482
- I can't get it out!
- There's nothing inside your suit.

39:56.644 --> 39:59.318
- Now, get back to the ship!
- it's in my helmet!

39:59.480 --> 40:02.324
- I can't take it out!
- Nate!

40:10.950 --> 40:12.748
Oh, Christ.

40:19.751 --> 40:21.173
Nate!

40:22.337 --> 40:23.509
Nate!

40:34.182 --> 40:36.605
Nate! You need oxygen!

40:41.230 --> 40:44.029
Come on, Nate!
You got to keep moving!

40:44.192 --> 40:46.320
Come on, we're almost there.

40:46.486 --> 40:50.036
Come on, Nate. Keep moving.

40:51.324 --> 40:53.452
You're almost there. Come on.

40:53.618 --> 40:55.461
Come on. We're almost there.

41:08.591 --> 41:10.810
Come on. Pull yourself in.

41:14.597 --> 41:15.564
Cabin's locked!

41:20.561 --> 41:23.986
Cabin repress auto, point-five PSI.

41:26.109 --> 41:28.407
Look, you're not getting enough oxygen.

41:35.910 --> 41:38.038
Hang on. Breathe!

41:38.204 --> 41:42.084
Breathe! PSI one.

41:43.710 --> 41:47.214
Look at me. You're gonna be all right.
Breathe. One-point-five.

41:49.841 --> 41:51.309
Two.

41:53.636 --> 41:55.388
Two-point-five.

41:58.599 --> 42:02.479
Three! Cabin pressure is stable.
It's OK. You're gonna be OK!

42:08.109 --> 42:10.953
So... you OK?

42:12.655 --> 42:14.532
I'm fine.

42:15.908 --> 42:17.876
What happened out there?

42:23.875 --> 42:27.925
You started screamin', I come
out there, you're on your back.

42:33.801 --> 42:36.975
Liberty, this is Freedom.
Do you read me? Over.

42:39.223 --> 42:42.227
Liberty this is Freedom.
Do you read? Over

42:47.815 --> 42:50.489
Uh, Houston, this is Freedom.
Do you read me? Over.

42:50.651 --> 42:54.201
- We read you, John. Over.
- I can't raise Liberty, Tommy.

42:54.363 --> 42:57.412
Copy that, Freedom.
We're having the same issues down here.

42:57.575 --> 42:59.794
Have you tried switching frequencies?

42:59.952 --> 43:02.171
Well, we've got some
sort of interference.

43:02.330 --> 43:05.630
Could have something
to do with those PSD5s.

43:05.792 --> 43:09.262
Yeah, we've been assured the PSD5s
aren't the source of the problem.

43:09.420 --> 43:11.969
All right, well, why don't we
try to shut down the receivers

43:12.131 --> 43:15.852
- and see what happens?
- Uh, negative.

43:16.010 --> 43:19.981
Well, why not? We got two men
down there, Tommy. Come on.

43:20.848 --> 43:22.395
Tommy?

43:23.392 --> 43:25.315
Tommy, you there?

43:25.478 --> 43:28.948
We're working on the problem, John.
We'll keep you advised.

43:29.107 --> 43:32.611
Oh, you're working on it.
That's great. Great.

43:33.486 --> 43:35.033
Goddamn it.

43:37.573 --> 43:40.702
Liberty, this is Freedom.
Do you copy?

43:44.914 --> 43:48.009
six days, 16 hours, 12 minutes.

43:48.167 --> 43:50.545
Post-EVA interview
one-alpha with Commander Walker.

43:51.629 --> 43:54.303
I already told you
everything I remember.

43:54.465 --> 43:56.092
Come on.

43:56.259 --> 43:58.387
I was repairing the S-Band.

43:59.804 --> 44:01.602
I thought I saw something...

44:03.558 --> 44:06.232
I thought I saw something
out of the corner of my eye.

44:06.394 --> 44:07.611
I was wrong.

44:09.063 --> 44:11.532
Then there was a shrieking noise.

44:11.691 --> 44:13.864
It caught me off guard. Slipped.

44:14.026 --> 44:15.903
Must have hit a rock.

44:17.321 --> 44:18.914
That's it.

44:20.783 --> 44:24.833
You said something was
inside your helmet. You yelled it.

44:33.713 --> 44:35.556
I don't remember that.

44:39.635 --> 44:42.434
Christ, Nate, you're bleeding.

44:42.597 --> 44:44.144
Look at your shirt. You're bleeding.

44:45.558 --> 44:48.937
- Jesus Christ!
- Hand me the first aid kit.

44:57.778 --> 44:59.951
You said something
was inside your suit, Nate.

45:05.328 --> 45:07.296
The inside, you said.

45:07.455 --> 45:09.674
You said inside your helmet.

45:16.464 --> 45:18.558
I don't get it.
How'd you get that wound?

45:20.051 --> 45:22.520
Now, if there was something in your
suit, then where the hell did it go?

45:24.222 --> 45:26.224
Wait a second.

45:26.390 --> 45:30.395
Nate... Look, I can feel it right...
right here.

45:31.812 --> 45:33.780
Oh, man, there's something inside.

45:33.940 --> 45:35.487
- What are you talkin' about?
- Right here, look.

45:35.650 --> 45:38.369
- It's hard, under the skin.
- Jesus.

45:44.158 --> 45:46.286
I need to get that out, OK?

45:47.161 --> 45:49.835
Yeah, OK, just make it quick.

45:50.957 --> 45:52.459
Just...

46:08.724 --> 46:11.648
It'll be all right. Hang in there.

46:11.811 --> 46:14.314
OK.

46:14.480 --> 46:17.324
Jesus, it's really in there.
It's like it's moving.

46:17.483 --> 46:21.204
- Get it out. Get it out!
- I got it. I got it. it's coming!

46:21.362 --> 46:23.456
Damn it, Ben! Get it out!

46:26.450 --> 46:28.919
Hey, are you all right? You all right?

46:29.078 --> 46:30.751
Hang on. Hang on.

46:32.164 --> 46:33.461
Hang on.

46:34.583 --> 46:36.301
Put something on it.

46:40.423 --> 46:42.471
It looks like one of my samples.

46:48.222 --> 46:51.852
You said you felt something
moving in your helmet.

46:53.477 --> 46:56.321
I don't understand.
How the hell did this get in...?

46:58.941 --> 47:02.115
Goddamn it, you contaminated
the entire ship!

47:08.075 --> 47:10.123
Liberty, do you copy?

47:14.832 --> 47:16.584
Houston, we read you.

47:17.626 --> 47:19.594
Liberty, can you hear us?

47:19.754 --> 47:22.132
Yes, damn it!
Houston, we read you!

47:24.342 --> 47:26.436
...Ben? Do you copy?

47:28.637 --> 47:30.560
They can't hear us.

47:30.723 --> 47:32.566
Liberty, do you read me?

47:50.493 --> 47:53.372
Those PSD5s...

47:55.373 --> 47:57.967
What if they're not there
for spying on the Russians?

47:58.125 --> 47:59.672
What do you mean?

48:02.630 --> 48:05.509
Look, they told us
that the transmitters

48:05.674 --> 48:09.144
would pick up an ALSEP frequency,
but they don't.

48:09.303 --> 48:12.728
They're blocking our comm.
They're emitting a signal.

48:21.482 --> 48:23.109
All right.

48:24.610 --> 48:26.612
But why would they be doing that?

48:26.779 --> 48:30.659
No, keep filming. Keep filming.
You need to document this.

48:33.077 --> 48:37.002
To attract the things that made
the tracks that you saw.

48:40.501 --> 48:42.799
Whatever killed the cosmonaut.

48:46.215 --> 48:48.263
All these cameras, Ben...

48:53.347 --> 48:55.190
...they're watching it.

48:56.142 --> 48:57.815
We're on our own.

48:59.895 --> 49:01.522
We're guinea pigs.

49:03.899 --> 49:05.242
That's why they sent us up here.

49:06.402 --> 49:08.496
We gotta dismantle those transmitters.

49:13.451 --> 49:15.954
PSD5's destroyed.

49:16.120 --> 49:18.214
There's debris everywhere.

49:24.211 --> 49:26.009
Look at these tracks.

49:31.177 --> 49:32.645
Nate, they were here.

49:38.976 --> 49:40.728
Let's check on the other sites.

49:45.483 --> 49:47.406
Liberty, do you copy?

49:49.403 --> 49:51.076
Liberty, do you copy?

49:52.531 --> 49:55.250
Liberty, this is Houston.
Do you copy?

50:04.084 --> 50:05.802
Something's out here.

50:14.094 --> 50:15.471
It's gone.

50:17.181 --> 50:19.650
Nate, we're too late.

50:22.269 --> 50:24.112
This was a bad idea.

50:24.271 --> 50:27.775
You need to get your rest, Nate, OK?
We're gonna get you back to the LM.

50:39.286 --> 50:41.880
Oh, Jesus Christ, Nate.

50:43.707 --> 50:45.630
It's entered your bloodstream.

50:47.962 --> 50:52.308
Previous wound seems to...
have become infected.

50:54.176 --> 50:56.599
Eyes appear extremely bloodshot.

51:03.602 --> 51:05.696
I don't know how to treat this.

51:10.693 --> 51:14.823
Houston, this is Freedom. I haven't
been able to reach Nate or Ben.

51:14.989 --> 51:16.787
Comm is still down
with Liberty.

51:16.949 --> 51:21.204
We have no communication with the crew,
but we are receiving data from the LM.

51:21.370 --> 51:24.715
We're trying to restore comm now.
Stand by, Freedom.

51:25.749 --> 51:27.626
Liberty, this is Houston.

51:27.793 --> 51:30.171
Looks like you can hear us,
but we can't hear you.

51:30.879 --> 51:35.100
We've lost the Westinghouse and your
vitals, but we're still getting LM data.

51:35.259 --> 51:38.479
We estimate 12 hours left
on your LM life support,

51:38.637 --> 51:40.810
and the troops are sortin'
out the engine problems.

51:40.973 --> 51:43.772
We're doin' everything we can.
We're gonna get you home.

51:43.934 --> 51:48.440
We're gonna get you home.

51:49.690 --> 51:51.317
They're lying.

51:54.820 --> 51:56.288
No.

51:57.615 --> 51:59.583
No, they'll get us back.

52:01.285 --> 52:04.630
They have to get us back.
They want that footage.

52:08.208 --> 52:11.712
- What about the Russian ship?
- That poor Russian bastard.

52:14.590 --> 52:18.140
He was infected, just like me.

52:19.386 --> 52:21.684
I'm getting worse.

52:21.847 --> 52:23.440
Ben.

52:24.933 --> 52:27.982
- You gotta leave me here.
- No.

52:33.942 --> 52:37.162
- No one's leaving anyone.
- You'll have to.

52:38.322 --> 52:40.700
We are not dying up here.

52:43.619 --> 52:46.463
Fate has ordained...

52:46.622 --> 52:50.752
...the men who went to the moon
to explore in peace...

52:50.918 --> 52:54.297
...remain on the moon
to rest in peace.

52:54.463 --> 52:56.716
What the hell
are you talking about?

52:56.882 --> 52:58.008
I feel my thoughts...

53:00.260 --> 53:02.228
...fragmenting.

53:08.936 --> 53:11.155
Like I'm being drawn to them.

53:11.814 --> 53:13.862
I'm so tired, Ben.

53:22.366 --> 53:26.542
six days, 22 hours, 23 minutes.

53:26.704 --> 53:29.002
IMP Anderson. Delta reel.

53:30.124 --> 53:32.468
No further communication
from Houston.

53:33.460 --> 53:35.554
Oxygen levels are running low.

53:38.340 --> 53:41.719
Nate's been asleep for about an hour.

53:43.137 --> 53:46.858
The sickness seems
to have brought on fatigue.

53:51.270 --> 53:53.113
We're not gonna make it here.

53:55.441 --> 53:57.785
If Houston doesn't come up with a plan
in the next couple of hours,

53:57.943 --> 54:00.617
we'll, uh...

54:01.447 --> 54:05.497
We'll abandon Liberty,
head towards the Russian LK.

54:06.994 --> 54:09.668
Their comm and oxygen
are our only hope.

54:13.000 --> 54:15.128
I just pray to God...

54:28.474 --> 54:30.351
Jesus Christ!

54:42.529 --> 54:44.372
Oh, Jesus.

54:46.492 --> 54:50.417
Partial laceration, upper left rib.

54:52.164 --> 54:54.292
The infection's spreading.

54:55.542 --> 54:57.294
Oh, goddamn it.

54:58.879 --> 55:01.723
Must've been the same thing
that happened to the Russian.

55:03.801 --> 55:07.271
- The rock... Christ, Nate!
- I'm not gonna let you kill me.

55:07.429 --> 55:09.898
Nate, it's me. Listen to me.
Look at me. it's me, OK?

55:10.057 --> 55:12.606
I'm just trying to help you.
You're gettin' worse.

55:16.021 --> 55:18.149
Don't ever touch me.

57:00.000 --> 57:01.172
Nate! Geez!

57:01.335 --> 57:02.302
What the hell are you doing?

57:02.461 --> 57:05.840
- They're everywhere!
- Please, Nate, you'll kill us both!

57:06.006 --> 57:08.384
- Stop watching us!
- No, Nate!

57:10.636 --> 57:13.230
They're not gonna watch me die!

57:13.388 --> 57:15.686
No!

57:15.849 --> 57:18.477
What are you doing? Stop!

57:19.895 --> 57:21.613
Stop! Come on, you're...!

57:23.815 --> 57:25.067
Nate!

57:50.425 --> 57:53.725
Liberty, this is Freedom.
Do you read me?

57:58.183 --> 58:00.311
Liberty, this is Freedom.

58:02.020 --> 58:05.069
I don't know if you can hear me,
but I'm gonna be out of comm range soon.

58:07.109 --> 58:12.036
Guys, we need to get you
out of there ASAP. Do you copy?

58:17.285 --> 58:20.334
Come on, guys.
Don't make me leave you here.

58:21.873 --> 58:24.251
Freedom, do you read me?

58:25.377 --> 58:26.845
John?

58:28.088 --> 58:30.182
John, can you hear me?

58:30.340 --> 58:34.436
Please, anyone, can you hear me?

58:36.304 --> 58:38.352
Abandoning Liberty.

58:50.152 --> 58:51.870
- Come on!
- I had to do it.

58:56.658 --> 58:58.376
Take the camera.

58:58.535 --> 59:01.288
We're at 25 percent
in the tank...

59:01.455 --> 59:04.709
...20 minutes on reserve.
It'll get us there.

59:04.875 --> 59:06.969
I gotta grab the film.

59:10.297 --> 59:13.050
The black box for DOD.

59:14.551 --> 59:17.976
We gotta go now. It's clear.

59:34.446 --> 59:35.663
Come on, Nate, let's go.

59:42.579 --> 59:44.547
They're everywhere.

59:44.706 --> 59:47.585
You can't help me.
You're not supposed to be here.

59:55.884 --> 59:57.682
Ben, it's OK.

59:59.638 --> 01:00:01.311
It's gonna be OK.

01:00:01.473 --> 01:00:03.441
We'll make it, OK?
We're gonna make it.

01:00:09.773 --> 01:00:12.276
They're waiting for me.

01:00:13.485 --> 01:00:15.032
We're not safe here.

01:00:20.617 --> 01:00:21.834
- Get rid of me!
- Hang in there!

01:00:21.993 --> 01:00:23.620
It's just me they want!
It's just me!

01:00:23.787 --> 01:00:25.084
- What the hell are you doing?
- Let me off!

01:00:25.247 --> 01:00:26.715
Just hang on!

01:00:52.357 --> 01:00:55.236
Nate!

01:00:56.278 --> 01:00:57.575
Nate!

01:01:00.323 --> 01:01:02.417
unknown.

01:01:05.036 --> 01:01:07.255
Rover's been destroyed.

01:01:09.708 --> 01:01:12.211
There's no sign of Commander Walker.

01:01:27.309 --> 01:01:31.234
American astronaut
Ben Anderson, Apollo 18.

01:01:38.945 --> 01:01:40.913
Oxygen's getting low.

01:01:48.205 --> 01:01:49.457
I'm...

01:01:51.082 --> 01:01:54.131
I'm gonna Search
for the Russian lander...

01:01:55.795 --> 01:01:57.297
...and Commander Walker.

01:02:04.721 --> 01:02:06.143
Nate!

01:02:06.681 --> 01:02:08.183
Nate!

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:18.990
Get away from me, Ben.
This is where they're coming from.

01:02:19.152 --> 01:02:21.575
There's nothing here, OK?
You gotta come with me.

01:02:21.738 --> 01:02:23.957
Goddamn it!
We need to get moving!

01:02:25.033 --> 01:02:26.706
Ben, listen to me.

01:02:28.578 --> 01:02:31.047
We're runnin'
out of time here, please.

01:02:31.206 --> 01:02:33.959
You gotta find the LK. Their
systems aren't that different from ours.

01:02:34.125 --> 01:02:35.627
Save yourself.

01:02:36.336 --> 01:02:38.839
No, Nate, I am not going.
You're coming with me.

01:02:39.005 --> 01:02:41.508
You have to leave me here.
Just get to John.

01:02:41.675 --> 01:02:42.847
I am not leaving here!

01:02:43.009 --> 01:02:46.309
You can't help me,
but you can save your...

01:02:46.471 --> 01:02:47.597
Nate!

01:02:48.181 --> 01:02:49.603
Nate!

01:02:49.766 --> 01:02:52.144
Jesus, Nate! Can you hear me?

01:02:53.853 --> 01:02:56.322
Nate, answer me!

01:02:58.608 --> 01:03:00.906
Do you hear me?
Say something, please!

01:03:09.995 --> 01:03:11.167
Nate, where are you?

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:43.904
Oh, no, no! Oh, my God!

01:03:44.779 --> 01:03:47.328
No! Christ!

01:03:47.490 --> 01:03:49.913
No!

01:03:57.125 --> 01:04:00.800
Oh, no! John, Nate's gone!
Repeat, Nate is gone!

01:04:03.798 --> 01:04:07.143
Please! Can anybody hear me?

01:04:41.753 --> 01:04:46.224
Oh, come on, come on!
Come on, electricity!

01:04:47.801 --> 01:04:49.974
Got it!

01:04:55.725 --> 01:04:57.398
Come on!

01:05:03.483 --> 01:05:05.531
Repress is almost complete.

01:05:25.505 --> 01:05:28.725
This is American astronaut
Ben Anderson.

01:05:28.883 --> 01:05:31.887
Apollo 18. Do you copy?

01:05:34.889 --> 01:05:37.517
This is Apollo 18. Do you copy?

01:05:43.690 --> 01:05:45.909
Anyone, do you copy?

01:05:47.777 --> 01:05:50.371
Anyone? Please, do you copy?

01:05:53.366 --> 01:05:54.663
Please, anybody, do you copy?

01:06:05.378 --> 01:06:07.051
Shit!

01:06:14.596 --> 01:06:17.850
Yes, this is Captain Ben Anderson
of Apollo 18. Do you read me?

01:06:21.561 --> 01:06:24.940
This is Ben Anderson. Copy? Anybody?

01:06:25.106 --> 01:06:27.279
Anybody? Please, do you read me?

01:06:31.696 --> 01:06:35.075
Captain Anderson,
this is the Deputy Secretary of Defense.

01:06:35.241 --> 01:06:38.836
What? DOD? Yes!

01:06:38.995 --> 01:06:41.748
Yes, this is Captain Ben Anderson.

01:06:41.915 --> 01:06:46.512
Communicating with the Russians
and they are patching me through to you.

01:06:46.669 --> 01:06:49.639
We're aware of your condition,

01:06:49.797 --> 01:06:51.925
and we've made a decision.

01:06:53.384 --> 01:06:55.352
- We can't bring you home.
- No.

01:06:55.512 --> 01:06:57.810
No, no, no.
No, listen to me, please.

01:06:57.972 --> 01:07:01.351
Listen, Nate got a cut on his body,
he got infected.

01:07:01.518 --> 01:07:04.112
There's nothing on me.
Please, you have to come get me.

01:07:06.272 --> 01:07:10.322
We can't take the risk.
We can't bring you back to Earth.

01:07:10.485 --> 01:07:14.331
Please. Please, listen to me,
listen to me. Um...

01:07:14.489 --> 01:07:18.744
I have a family.
I need my family, please.

01:07:21.329 --> 01:07:24.299
We'll let your family
know you died a hero.

01:07:25.291 --> 01:07:26.634
I'm sorry, Ben.

01:07:31.089 --> 01:07:35.139
You gotta get... You get out here!
And you'll fuckin' pick me up right now!

01:07:35.301 --> 01:07:38.726
I did my job!
You do your job, you get me home!

01:07:47.438 --> 01:07:49.315
Houston, please.

01:07:50.483 --> 01:07:54.078
We'll stay on this channel with you,
but this decision's final.

01:07:54.237 --> 01:07:58.492
You've done a great service
for your country, son, and for mankind.

01:08:14.716 --> 01:08:16.593
MET...

01:08:18.176 --> 01:08:19.429
...remote comm...

01:08:22.890 --> 01:08:26.939
Astronaut Ryan Anderson,
with his dad, flying through space.

01:08:28.854 --> 01:08:32.029
- Ryan, what are you doing?
- Just playing, Mom.

01:08:32.191 --> 01:08:34.694
Don't play
with your dad's stuff

01:08:34.861 --> 01:08:37.910
- Baby, is that recording?
- Sorry, Dad. Love you.

01:08:41.451 --> 01:08:44.203
Baby, is that recording?

01:08:44.370 --> 01:08:46.042
Sorry, Dad. Love you.

01:08:47.372 --> 01:08:49.341
Love you. Love you.

01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:51.298
...Dad. Love you.

01:08:51.461 --> 01:08:53.212
Love you.

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:06.188
This is Freedom,
do you read me?

01:09:08.019 --> 01:09:10.020
Liberty, this is Freedom.

01:09:11.689 --> 01:09:15.410
Liberty, this is Freedom.
Do you read me?

01:09:15.568 --> 01:09:19.118
- Liberty, this is Freedom.
- Yes, John, it's Ben. I hear you!

01:09:19.279 --> 01:09:21.122
Ben, is that you? Do you copy?

01:09:21.282 --> 01:09:24.456
Yes, John, this is Ben.
I hear you, copy.

01:09:26.453 --> 01:09:30.004
I got you on the VHF, partner.
Where the hell are you?

01:09:30.166 --> 01:09:33.261
- I'm in the LK.
- Yes! Goddamn.

01:09:33.961 --> 01:09:36.589
They left me, John. Left me here!

01:09:36.756 --> 01:09:38.929
Where's Nate? How is he?

01:09:41.010 --> 01:09:43.058
He got sick and he didn't make it.

01:09:45.598 --> 01:09:47.600
There's something down here, John.

01:09:48.518 --> 01:09:53.194
And they knew about it. You hear me?
Those bastards knew about it!

01:09:53.356 --> 01:09:55.700
Forget about the DOD, Ben.

01:09:55.858 --> 01:10:00.159
Ben, I'm gonna get you outta there, OK?
You think you can pilot that thing?

01:10:00.321 --> 01:10:04.167
- ...Pilot that thing?
- I don't have much a choice, do I?

01:10:08.121 --> 01:10:11.842
Pilot ails look good, and there's...
there's plenty of fuel.

01:10:11.999 --> 01:10:14.627
OK, buddy, you're not gonna
be able to dock with the CSM,

01:10:14.794 --> 01:10:16.717
so you're gonna need
to get into a synchronized orbit

01:10:16.879 --> 01:10:21.134
and you're gonna need to do
a little spacewalk... step on board.

01:10:21.300 --> 01:10:23.302
How does that sound to you, pal?

01:10:23.469 --> 01:10:25.221
Sounds beautiful, Johnny.

01:10:26.889 --> 01:10:28.687
Sounds really beautiful.

01:10:31.686 --> 01:10:34.109
I don't mean to rush you, partner,
but we are running out of time.

01:10:34.272 --> 01:10:37.651
Tick-tock. You get that thing
into orbit, we can rendezvous.

01:10:39.736 --> 01:10:42.910
I got it!

01:10:43.072 --> 01:10:44.164
I got it, John!

01:10:44.323 --> 01:10:46.951
Seven... six...

01:10:47.118 --> 01:10:49.496
...five...

01:10:49.662 --> 01:10:52.541
- Holy shit!
- Open this door.

01:10:52.707 --> 01:10:55.631
Nate, you know I can't do that.
Please, you'll kill us both!

01:10:55.793 --> 01:10:58.421
- I can't let you in.
- Then I'm comin' in.

01:10:58.588 --> 01:11:02.434
No, no, no, no!
Nate, you'll kill us both! Please!

01:11:02.592 --> 01:11:04.469
- What do you mean, Nate?
- Please! Nate!

01:11:04.635 --> 01:11:07.434
- What do you mean, Nate? Nate's dead!
- No! Stop!

01:11:10.057 --> 01:11:12.480
- Please! Stop!
- What's goin' on?!

01:11:12.643 --> 01:11:14.190
- Stop!
- What's going on?!

01:11:14.353 --> 01:11:17.482
No, Nate, don't do it, please! Please!

01:11:19.025 --> 01:11:21.448
Jesus Christ! No!

01:11:23.112 --> 01:11:24.864
Nate?

01:11:25.948 --> 01:11:30.203
Nate. Oh, Christ. Nate!

01:11:31.954 --> 01:11:37.176
No, no! No, no, no!

01:11:37.335 --> 01:11:39.713
All right, Ben, if you
can launch, you need to do it now.

01:11:39.879 --> 01:11:42.007
Our window is almost gone.
You need to launch!

01:11:42.715 --> 01:11:45.343
Goddamn it, Ben,
we are cuttin' it way too close.

01:11:45.510 --> 01:11:47.763
Benny, we are goin' home!

01:11:50.890 --> 01:11:54.360
Benny, listen to me now.

01:11:54.519 --> 01:11:56.521
We're gonna go home.

01:11:56.687 --> 01:11:58.940
You hear me?
We're gonna go home.

01:12:01.526 --> 01:12:04.370
I'm comin' home. I'm comin' home.

01:12:11.494 --> 01:12:12.996
I have liftoff.

01:12:13.913 --> 01:12:15.961
Freedom, do you read?

01:12:16.123 --> 01:12:18.501
This is the Deputy Secretary of Defense.

01:12:18.668 --> 01:12:21.763
Ben has been contaminated.
Do not try to rescue him.

01:12:21.921 --> 01:12:24.390
Repeat, you will not recover him.

01:12:26.133 --> 01:12:29.182
Contaminated by what? DOD?

01:12:29.345 --> 01:12:31.188
What are you saying?
Where's Tommy?

01:12:31.347 --> 01:12:34.476
You will not recover Anderson.
That is a direct order.

01:12:39.689 --> 01:12:41.487
I'm on my way.

01:12:47.405 --> 01:12:49.874
John, you are ordered
to abort rescue immediately.

01:12:50.032 --> 01:12:52.535
Captain Anderson
is a high contamination threat.

01:12:52.702 --> 01:12:54.124
You will not recover him.

01:12:54.287 --> 01:12:57.086
You knew something was down
there and you sent them anyway.

01:12:57.748 --> 01:13:00.046
I'm comin' home.

01:13:00.209 --> 01:13:03.804
I'm comin' home, Ryan.
I'm comin' home.

01:13:03.963 --> 01:13:08.264
DOD to Freedom, if you do not abort
in T-minus 60 seconds,

01:13:08.426 --> 01:13:10.224
transmission will terminate.

01:13:11.053 --> 01:13:13.306
You will not receive
an updated state vector.

01:13:13.472 --> 01:13:17.648
You will run out of life support
package. You will not return home.

01:13:19.145 --> 01:13:22.115
You have 45 seconds
to abort this rescue.

01:13:24.150 --> 01:13:27.654
John, we have no choice.
We are begging you, do not do this.

01:13:27.820 --> 01:13:30.164
Goddamn it, Benny!

01:13:31.741 --> 01:13:33.334
We are goin' home!

01:13:39.248 --> 01:13:42.343
Engine cutoff. I'm in orbit!

01:13:56.515 --> 01:13:58.938
Ben! Ben!

01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:03.523
Forget about me, John.
Get outta here.

01:14:05.900 --> 01:14:07.902
Ben, you're coming in too fast.

01:14:09.904 --> 01:14:13.033
We're gonna impact! Slow it down!

01:14:14.992 --> 01:14:16.869
Ben!
