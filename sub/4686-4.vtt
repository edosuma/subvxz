WEBVTT

00:00.055 --> 00:01.303
So here's what you missed
on Glee.

00:01.325 --> 00:03.126
Rachel got the lead in Funny Girl
on Broadway

00:03.137 --> 00:04.462
and Kurt now he's starting
a band.

00:04.480 --> 00:06.206
Sue framed Figgins so now
she's a principal

00:06.219 --> 00:07.126
and Becky's a becretary.

00:07.139 --> 00:09.341
I'm planning on installing Becky
as my secretary

00:09.366 --> 00:11.956
and I will refer to her as my
becretary.

00:11.975 --> 00:13.952
There's a new bitch on the Cheerio!
and her name's Bree.

00:13.972 --> 00:15.580
And there's a new school nurse,
her name's Penny.

00:15.598 --> 00:16.393
Penny Owen.

00:16.406 --> 00:18.226
And she gave Sam a shock of
***

00:18.239 --> 00:19.639
and now he's got like the
biggest crush ever.

00:19.653 --> 00:22.199
It's your responsibility to dance
with me.

00:22.218 --> 00:24.020
Jake and Marley have found
true love so you know

00:24.030 --> 00:24.630
that's gonna last.

00:24.643 --> 00:25.944
It's you and me against the world.

00:25.963 --> 00:27.821
And that's what you missed
on Glee.

00:34.239 --> 00:37.408
(chatter, singing,
playing instruments continues)

00:37.442 --> 00:38.775
All right, big week, guys.

00:38.810 --> 00:40.844
Come on. Gather round.
I have here in my hand...

00:40.878 --> 00:41.878
Drumroll, please...

00:41.913 --> 00:45.216
A secret list
of the show choirs

00:45.250 --> 00:46.949
that we will be
in competition with

00:46.984 --> 00:48.718
at Nationals in six weeks.

00:48.752 --> 00:50.720
Ooh... Yes. Okay, let's
see what we've got.

00:50.754 --> 00:52.722
We got the Rust-Belters
from Pittsburgh,

00:52.756 --> 00:54.857
the Thunder Showcats
from Gainesville

00:54.891 --> 00:57.059
(clears throat)
and finally, from Fort Wayne,

00:57.094 --> 00:58.361
Throat Explosion.

00:58.395 --> 01:00.963
No!

01:00.998 --> 01:03.265
Why, God?!

01:03.299 --> 01:04.099
(groans)

01:04.134 --> 01:05.300
Uh, what? Throat Explosion?

01:05.334 --> 01:06.301
That's a joke, right?

01:06.336 --> 01:07.302
Anything but.

01:07.337 --> 01:08.670
They're the new supergroup

01:08.704 --> 01:10.105
the Show Choir Underground's
been buzzing about.

01:10.140 --> 01:12.741
Their budgets for costume,
makeup, hair alone

01:12.775 --> 01:14.776
are astronomical. You guys have
read that Malcolm Gladwell book.

01:14.810 --> 01:15.611
<i>Outliers,</i> right?

01:17.147 --> 01:20.114
So, Gladwell says you can't
possibly master anything

01:20.149 --> 01:22.617
unless you've spent 10,000
hours practicing it.

01:22.651 --> 01:25.620
So students can't even join
Throat Explosion without proving

01:25.654 --> 01:28.689
they've logged in 10,000 hours
of show choir rehearsal.

01:28.723 --> 01:30.191
<i>They don't even go to class.</i>

01:30.225 --> 01:32.793
<i>They just perform,</i>
<i>every minute of every day.</i>

01:32.827 --> 01:35.228
<i>They live their art.</i>
<i>They know no boundaries.</i>

01:35.263 --> 01:37.430
<i>They're constantly pushing the</i>
<i>envelope, living and performing</i>

01:37.465 --> 01:39.132
<i>on the edge.</i>
<i>They're like mini Lady Gagas.</i>

01:39.167 --> 01:40.634
(cackles)

01:40.668 --> 01:42.602
We're so screwed... they're not
like Vocal Adrenaline,

01:42.637 --> 01:43.936
who were unfeeling Borg robots.

01:43.971 --> 01:45.405
They're total outsiders
and misfits,

01:45.439 --> 01:47.407
which used to be our niche.
We can't compete

01:47.441 --> 01:49.409
with Throat Explosion anymore
at that level because we lost

01:49.443 --> 01:51.310
our biggest Gaga
when Kurt graduated last year.

01:51.344 --> 01:53.646
Look around, we're a room
full of, like, Katy Perrys now.

01:53.680 --> 01:55.320
Oh, you best check
your spectrum, Queen T,

01:55.348 --> 01:57.983
because orange is the new black,
and Unique is the new Gaga.

01:58.017 --> 01:59.618
Well, not Marley...
she's a Katy Perry.

01:59.653 --> 02:02.621
So is Sam, so is Blaine. I'm a
Katy Perry and I'm proud of it.

02:02.656 --> 02:04.223
Uh, the truth is, Tina,
we're a potent mix

02:04.257 --> 02:06.224
of Katy Perrys and Lady Gagas
in here.

02:06.258 --> 02:07.525
But it's not a liability...

02:07.560 --> 02:09.960
it's the way we're gonna
beat Throat Explosion.

02:09.995 --> 02:11.762
Some of us in here are,
you know,

02:11.797 --> 02:14.465
- ambi-edge. - Ambi-edge?
You just made that up.

02:14.500 --> 02:17.101
Uh, some of us are more,
you know, wholesome,

02:17.135 --> 02:20.271
innocent, romantic, all-American
girl-and boy-next-door types.

02:20.306 --> 02:22.739
Uh, who in here would describe
themselves as a Gaga?

02:23.774 --> 02:25.242
Okay, great.

02:25.276 --> 02:26.610
And the rest of you are Katys?

02:26.644 --> 02:27.811
Is there a third option?

02:27.845 --> 02:29.680
We're gonna mix it up
a little bit.

02:29.714 --> 02:32.282
We're turning our weaknesses
into our strengths.

02:33.951 --> 02:36.353
This week, the Katys
will get their Gaga on

02:36.387 --> 02:38.121
and the Gagas
will bring the Katy.

02:38.155 --> 02:39.522
Throat Explosion
does their one thing

02:39.556 --> 02:40.989
very, very well,

02:41.024 --> 02:43.292
but we need to be able
to do both, impeccably,

02:43.327 --> 02:44.960
or else we're not gonna have
a chance in hell

02:44.994 --> 02:46.234
of winning Nationals this year.

02:49.531 --> 02:52.444

02:52.703 --> 02:54.669
(door bell jingles)
Here's your check.

02:54.704 --> 02:56.003
Where have you been?

02:56.038 --> 02:57.739
You said you were only gonna
be five minutes late.

02:57.773 --> 02:59.474
I was at Cooper Square.
I was putting an ad

02:59.508 --> 03:01.843
in <i>The Village Voice</i>
for my new band.

03:01.877 --> 03:03.645
Wait, you're starting
a new band?

03:03.679 --> 03:05.647
Yes, yes, well,
I-I sort of have to

03:05.681 --> 03:07.482
'cause Adam kicked me out
of the Adam's Apples

03:07.516 --> 03:08.850
when he found out
I was engaged.

03:08.884 --> 03:10.851
Well, what kind of band
are you starting?

03:10.885 --> 03:12.152
Are you taking girls?

03:12.186 --> 03:15.489
Well, originally, I was thinking
of a Madonna cover band,

03:15.523 --> 03:18.325
but I think I want it to
be more organic than that.

03:18.360 --> 03:20.994
So, yes, girls will be in it,
and I was hoping

03:21.028 --> 03:23.797
the three of you could spare me
the agony of open auditions

03:23.831 --> 03:24.998
by signing up.

03:25.032 --> 03:26.499
I don't know, Kurt.

03:26.533 --> 03:28.501
I think it's just
a little too soon.

03:28.535 --> 03:31.971
Rachel, Finn wouldn't want you
sitting on the sidelines

03:32.005 --> 03:33.406
while life passes you by.

03:33.440 --> 03:35.007
I know. It's just that,

03:35.041 --> 03:36.676
with whatever strength
and creative energy I have,

03:36.710 --> 03:38.010
it has to go towards <i>Funny Girl.</i>

03:38.044 --> 03:39.211
I think that joining a band
right now

03:39.246 --> 03:40.546
would just be a little
too much, but...

03:40.581 --> 03:42.381
thanks.

03:42.415 --> 03:43.482
Well, you've got me.

03:43.516 --> 03:44.650
Yes!

03:44.684 --> 03:46.518
What about you, babe?

03:46.552 --> 03:49.187
Okay, I guess. But, listen,
if we're going to be

03:49.221 --> 03:51.456
a part of this band,
we don't just get to help

03:51.491 --> 03:54.526
with the set list. We also get
a say on who joins, right?

03:54.560 --> 03:58.263
Sure. As long as you don't go
all crazy Nicki Minaj on me,

03:58.297 --> 03:59.863
I'll see you at auditions.

04:01.099 --> 04:03.100
(school bell rings)

04:04.969 --> 04:06.837
Well, hi!

04:06.871 --> 04:08.572
Hey.
What's up with your arm?

04:08.607 --> 04:09.873
Is that a... tattoo?

04:09.908 --> 04:11.742
No... no, it's just
a temporary one.

04:11.777 --> 04:14.178
I like to tat up when I go
to Skrillex concerts.

04:14.212 --> 04:15.512
Last time I was there,

04:15.546 --> 04:17.514
he spit in a cup
and threw it on me.

04:17.548 --> 04:19.449
Gross.

04:19.483 --> 04:22.585
Or cool. I guess I wouldn't
have pegged you for the hardcore

04:22.620 --> 04:24.421
dance punk
electronica kind of girl.

04:24.455 --> 04:25.935
I know, right?
The last guy I dated...

04:25.956 --> 04:28.391
I realize now
he's a total dillweed...

04:28.426 --> 04:30.193
but I kind of liked
his taste in music.

04:30.227 --> 04:32.894
I think I have, like,
a musical dark side.

04:32.929 --> 04:34.930
Whoa.
Who is that?

04:36.065 --> 04:38.967
Oh, uh, True Jackson, Lulu
and, uh, Ryan.

04:40.169 --> 04:41.637
You haven't seen
<i>True Jackson, VP?</i>

04:41.671 --> 04:42.938
Mm-mm.
Oh, my God.

04:42.972 --> 04:44.573
It's awesome.
I have all three seasons on DVD.

04:44.607 --> 04:46.007
Have you ever thought
about what you would do

04:46.042 --> 04:47.575
if you landed your
dream job as a big shot

04:47.609 --> 04:50.144
of a major company
and you were only 15?

04:50.178 --> 04:52.380
I mean, how would you decorate
your office? Who would you hire?

04:52.414 --> 04:54.382
True Jackson gets the chance
of a lifetime when she's hired

04:54.416 --> 04:56.384
by her idol and made VP of
his fashion empire and then

04:56.418 --> 04:58.152
every week she has to navigate
this scary new world

04:58.186 --> 05:00.221
because True Jackson's gone
from homeroom to the boardroom.

05:00.255 --> 05:01.589
W...

05:01.623 --> 05:02.789
Wow, Sam.

05:02.824 --> 05:04.958
This is not
how I saw you at all.

05:04.992 --> 05:06.593
W... Uh, weren't you a stripper?

05:06.627 --> 05:10.063
Uh, well, uh, we prefer the term
"erotic entertainer."

05:10.097 --> 05:11.598
Ah. I was gonna ask you, uh,

05:11.632 --> 05:13.600
w-would you maybe want
to go out this weekend,

05:13.634 --> 05:15.335
like, um, on a date?

05:15.370 --> 05:19.004
Um, actually,
my ex is taking me

05:19.038 --> 05:21.474
to the Nine Inch Nails concert
in Columbus this weekend.

05:21.508 --> 05:23.609
- Not the dillweed.
- Actually, yeah.

05:23.643 --> 05:24.910
I-It's cool though.
We're just friends now,

05:24.944 --> 05:26.912
but he bought the tickets
when we were still dating,

05:26.946 --> 05:28.313
and he really wants me
to go and...

05:28.348 --> 05:30.148
Anyway, look,

05:30.183 --> 05:32.184
I'll call you.

05:34.987 --> 05:36.488
(school bell rings)

05:36.522 --> 05:38.823
<i>True Jackson, VP?</i>
Is that even on anymore?

05:38.858 --> 05:41.025
No, it got canceled. Evidently,
the people at Nickelodeon

05:41.059 --> 05:43.160
don't care about
quality entertainment.

05:43.195 --> 05:45.029
Don't judge me, dude, okay?
I'm bad-ass.

05:45.063 --> 05:47.365
I play football and guitar and
I've been hillbilly handfishing.

05:47.400 --> 05:50.034
I just... I happen to
like sweet things, too.

05:50.068 --> 05:52.369
They relax me. Which is
why I like her so much.

05:52.404 --> 05:54.772
But you said that she's into
Skrillex and Nine Inch Nails.

05:54.806 --> 05:57.140
So she clearly isn't
exactly what she seems.

05:57.174 --> 05:59.276
Exactly! She seems like a Katy
but she's secretly a Gaga,

05:59.310 --> 06:00.944
and she only dates Gagas
and I'm a Katy.

06:00.978 --> 06:02.946
Okay, well, hold up.
Penny likes Gagas

06:02.980 --> 06:05.115
and you're a Katy.
But Mr. Shue's making

06:05.149 --> 06:06.516
all the Katys sing a Gaga song,

06:06.550 --> 06:09.051
so we bring Penny in to see it

06:09.085 --> 06:11.487
and she's gonna get all weak
in her Skrillex-loving knees

06:11.522 --> 06:13.556
and forget all
about her douche ex-boyfriend.

06:13.590 --> 06:14.957
Then you, my friend,

06:14.991 --> 06:16.559
will have a new love
of your life.

06:16.593 --> 06:18.160
Yes.

06:18.194 --> 06:20.362
This Katy/Gaga lesson
is killing me.

06:20.397 --> 06:22.697
It's like Mr. Shue did it
on purpose to keep us apart.

06:22.732 --> 06:24.098
I don't think he
plans that much ahead.

06:24.133 --> 06:25.834
I'm pretty sure he makes up
these rando lessons

06:25.868 --> 06:27.969
a split second before he
writes 'em on the board.

06:28.003 --> 06:30.138
Speaking of this week's lesson,

06:30.172 --> 06:33.074
are you still okay
with dating someone so...

06:33.108 --> 06:35.009
different than you?

06:40.682 --> 06:42.650
(blowing raspberry)

06:42.684 --> 06:45.653
I had Artie first, "bee-yatch"!

06:45.687 --> 06:47.488
You get my sloppy seconds.

06:47.522 --> 06:48.989
Oh, snap!

06:50.391 --> 06:52.192
I did not have sex with Becky.

06:54.000 --> 07:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:01.569 --> 07:04.537
So... how long do
we have to wait here?

07:04.572 --> 07:05.905
(sighs) This is humiliating.

07:05.940 --> 07:08.307
I spent all of my tip money
renting out this room

07:08.342 --> 07:09.843
because I thought
we'd have a turnout.

07:09.877 --> 07:11.309
SANTANA: What did you expect?
No one's gonna try out

07:11.344 --> 07:12.611
for a band that doesn't
even have a name.

07:12.645 --> 07:15.080
Although I came up
with an amazing one.

07:15.114 --> 07:19.217
Okay, we are not naming the
band the Apocalipsticks, okay?

07:19.251 --> 07:21.887
I'm manifesting the
perfect name, all right?

07:21.921 --> 07:25.090
It takes time. Yeah, and in the
meantime, no one signs up.

07:25.124 --> 07:28.092
Well, one person did.
They obviously chickened out.

07:28.126 --> 07:29.560
Maybe it's for the best.

07:29.595 --> 07:31.462
I mean, who names
himself Starchild?

07:31.429 --> 07:34.063
***

07:34.210 --> 07:36.158
***

07:36.221 --> 07:36.845
Sorry I'm late.

07:36.959 --> 07:37.983
People kept stopping me
on the street,

07:38.038 --> 07:40.172
Asking if they could take
their picture with me.

07:40.105 --> 07:42.739
Yeah, 'cause you look
friggin' bad-ass.

07:42.773 --> 07:44.273
Thanks.

07:44.308 --> 07:46.510
I design and sew
this costume myself.

07:46.544 --> 07:48.478
It's a little Project Runway,

07:48.513 --> 07:50.346
Season 6.

07:50.381 --> 07:52.021
- Have you prepared a song?
- Yeah, of course.

07:52.049 --> 07:53.517
It's by one
of my favorite artists,

07:53.551 --> 07:55.852
somebody that always inspires me
to be myself,

07:55.887 --> 07:58.254
no matter what...

Bravo!

10:58.323 --> 10:59.356
I would not

10:59.391 --> 11:00.992
be embarrassed
to share the stage with you.

11:01.026 --> 11:03.260
You just rocked it so hard.

11:03.295 --> 11:05.261
Thanks. Thank you for
your time, Starchild,

11:05.296 --> 11:07.097
but it's not a fit.

11:07.131 --> 11:08.732
Are you insane?
I'm sorry. Would you mind

11:08.733 --> 11:10.100
just stepping outside
for a moment while I bitch-slap

11:10.134 --> 11:11.334
some sense into my friend?

11:11.368 --> 11:12.502
No, I don't need
a minute, okay?

11:12.536 --> 11:13.603
I've made my decision,
all right?

11:13.637 --> 11:15.972
Your aesthetic is
striking, Starchild,

11:16.007 --> 11:20.210
but it's a little outré for
the team that I'm assembling.

11:20.244 --> 11:21.376
But if you're willing

11:21.411 --> 11:22.511
to tone down your look,

11:22.545 --> 11:23.545
maybe I'd reconsider.

11:35.158 --> 11:37.425
You wanted to see me,
Principal Sylvester?

11:37.459 --> 11:38.926
SUE: Would you care
to explain

11:38.960 --> 11:40.461
why you're dressed
like Lady Gaga?

11:40.496 --> 11:43.330
Would you care to explain why
<i>you're</i> dressed like Lady Gaga?

11:43.364 --> 11:44.931
I don't know
what you're talking about.

11:44.965 --> 11:46.933
If you're referring
to my face cage,

11:46.967 --> 11:48.935
I'll have you know that
tomorrow I'm scheduled

11:48.969 --> 11:50.437
for a routine colonoscopy,

11:50.471 --> 11:53.674
and this apparatus helps
me avoid solid foods.

11:53.708 --> 11:56.443
Okay. Well, the Glee Club

11:56.477 --> 11:58.712
you specifically asked me
to try to mess with

11:58.746 --> 12:01.380
is doing some
Katy Perry-Lady Gaga week

12:01.415 --> 12:04.717
in an attempt to get 100%
of America to not like them.

12:04.751 --> 12:06.051
Anyway,
Jake Puckerman's a Gaga,

12:06.086 --> 12:08.621
and he's all up in that girl
Marley with the fat mom,

12:08.655 --> 12:10.423
who's a Katy, probably because

12:10.457 --> 12:13.359
her mom's boobs also
shoot out whipped cream.

12:13.393 --> 12:14.793
So, I thought I'd throw
a little Gaga his way,

12:14.828 --> 12:16.027
and see what happens.

12:16.061 --> 12:17.262
This practice of referring

12:17.296 --> 12:19.864
to oneself
as a Katy or a Gaga...

12:19.898 --> 12:23.034
the Glee Club will be
doing this the entire week?

12:23.068 --> 12:24.102
Super annoying, right?

12:24.136 --> 12:26.137
It is the most annoying thing

12:26.171 --> 12:28.039
they've ever done.

12:28.073 --> 12:29.040
Ugh!

12:29.074 --> 12:30.475
Well, it appears Will Schuester

12:30.509 --> 12:32.476
has taken up
the age-old question

12:32.510 --> 12:35.946
that has vexed
creepy pederasts since Socrates.

12:35.980 --> 12:37.781
Before Katy versus Gaga,

12:37.815 --> 12:40.451
it was Jackie versus Marilyn,
Betty versus Veronica,

12:40.485 --> 12:43.287
Mary Todd Lincoln versus
Martha Washington.

12:43.321 --> 12:46.957
Why must we always choose
<i>between</i> female pop archetypes?

12:46.991 --> 12:48.958
Why can't we just be them all?

12:48.992 --> 12:51.160
I sort of don't know what
you're talking about anymore.

12:51.194 --> 12:54.330
That's because, for the past
12 hours, I have ingested

12:54.365 --> 12:56.566
eight gallons
of saline solution.

12:56.600 --> 12:59.435
I have more salt water in
my colon than Richard Simmons

12:59.470 --> 13:01.337
after a poorly-executed
cannonball

13:01.372 --> 13:03.438
off the Fire Island Ferry.

13:03.473 --> 13:05.741
Now get the hell
out of my office.

13:07.977 --> 13:09.844
(school bell ringing)

13:09.879 --> 13:13.014
Okay, we have to get to
Breadstix extra early on Friday

13:13.048 --> 13:15.350
because they are having
a Julie Andrews tribute

13:15.385 --> 13:16.518
at the Lima Limelight.

13:16.552 --> 13:18.787
<i>Mary Poppins, Sound of Music,</i>

13:18.821 --> 13:20.521
Princess Diaries, back to back.

13:20.555 --> 13:22.456
It's gonna be amazing.

13:22.491 --> 13:23.891
Yeah, that sounds
really awesome.

13:23.925 --> 13:27.194
Do you <i>not</i> think
it sounds amazing?

13:27.228 --> 13:28.562
I mean, it's just,
like, the same thing.

13:28.597 --> 13:31.299
Breadstix, movie, Breadstix,
movie, Breadstix, three movies,

13:31.333 --> 13:32.533
weekend after weekend.

13:32.567 --> 13:33.734
(sighs)

13:33.769 --> 13:35.368
I love you.

13:35.403 --> 13:37.437
I'm bored of doing
the same thing.

13:37.471 --> 13:40.540
Let's just, uh...

13:40.574 --> 13:41.874
shake it up a little bit, eh?

13:41.909 --> 13:44.411
Okay. Okay.
Uh, forget <i>Mary Poppins.</i>

13:44.445 --> 13:45.878
We can do something else.
Okay.

13:45.913 --> 13:48.748
Um, uh, they're having
Orchid Mania at the gardens.

13:50.451 --> 13:51.717
Uh, at the mall,

13:51.751 --> 13:53.452
there's a mobile
cat adoption we could go to.

13:53.486 --> 13:55.954
You are such a Katy.

13:55.988 --> 13:57.656
I don't know how you're gonna
pull off being a Gaga.

13:57.691 --> 14:00.693
Why? Because I like cats
and flowers and Julie Andrews?

14:01.894 --> 14:04.196
That doesn't mean
I can't rock a bra

14:04.230 --> 14:05.831
made out
of gloved leather hands.

14:05.865 --> 14:09.500
Ooh, and I cannot wait
to see that.

14:09.535 --> 14:11.836
Come on.

14:11.870 --> 14:14.505
All right, Gagas, I'm taking
over this Monster Ball,

14:14.540 --> 14:15.673
since I'm obviously

14:15.708 --> 14:17.241
the edgiest one in the group.

14:17.275 --> 14:19.076
And as a former teen stripper,
I understand the...

14:19.110 --> 14:21.245
power of theatricality
and performativity.

14:21.279 --> 14:23.280
Yeah, but what-what
are they building?

14:23.315 --> 14:25.248
The future, Ryder.
They're building the future.

14:25.282 --> 14:26.249
All right, we're
gonna get scary

14:26.283 --> 14:28.051
and weird and controversial.

14:28.085 --> 14:30.053
Uh, hence the catwalk?

14:30.087 --> 14:31.388
We're taking it into
the audience, Blaine, right

14:31.422 --> 14:33.390
in their faces and we're gonna
drop-kick the fourth wall.

14:33.424 --> 14:34.924
Are those strobe lights?
Believe it!

14:34.959 --> 14:36.727
Because some kids
might be epileptic.

14:36.761 --> 14:39.395
Is it a seizure or is it just hardcore
next-level break-dancing? I don't know.

14:39.429 --> 14:42.465
Come on, guys, I need sick ideas...
if we're gonna impress Penny,

14:42.499 --> 14:43.899
this thing has to be so crazy

14:43.933 --> 14:46.301
that it's declared legally
and clinically insane.

14:46.336 --> 14:50.740
What if we had, like,
sparklers but we're inside?

14:50.774 --> 14:53.075
That's crazy. RYDER: Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.

14:53.109 --> 14:55.410
Or-or, uh, confetti,
only shaped like human skulls.

14:55.444 --> 14:57.879
No! No, no, no, no!
No, those ideas suck!

14:57.913 --> 14:59.481
You're not thinking
edgy and fresh!

14:59.515 --> 15:01.315
You're thinking safe
and tired and boring!

15:01.350 --> 15:02.917
Okay, look, here.

15:02.951 --> 15:04.386
Take the sheet music
for "Applause," okay?

15:04.420 --> 15:05.387
Learn it.

15:05.421 --> 15:06.388
Own it.

15:06.422 --> 15:08.222
Live it.

15:08.257 --> 15:09.724
And then
strap in because right...

15:09.759 --> 15:10.892
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, Artie.

15:10.926 --> 15:12.426
We're not doing
this for Glee Club.

15:12.460 --> 15:14.561
We're doing this in front
of the entire school.

15:14.596 --> 15:16.096
And, yes,

15:16.130 --> 15:17.931
Penny the school nurse will be
in attendance.

15:17.965 --> 15:20.100
(gasps) Now, if
you'll excuse me,

15:20.134 --> 15:21.902
I'm gonna go guarantee
a sold-out show.

15:21.936 --> 15:23.103
How are you gonna do that?

15:23.137 --> 15:24.237
The same way Gaga would:

15:24.272 --> 15:26.306
by recruiting
some Little Monsters.

15:27.441 --> 15:29.275
(school bell rings)
SAM: Hey, Becky.

15:29.309 --> 15:31.511
Wait up. I need
your help with something.

15:31.545 --> 15:32.912
Bug off.

15:32.946 --> 15:35.247
I don't do handies.

15:35.282 --> 15:37.016
What? Uh, no. That's
not what I meant.

15:37.050 --> 15:38.518
Just stop for a
second, okay? Look.

15:38.552 --> 15:40.119
I know what your deal is:

15:40.153 --> 15:42.455
on the outside,
you pretend to be Katy, but...

15:42.489 --> 15:45.123
inside your soul is pure Gaga.

15:45.157 --> 15:46.725
What are you talking about?

15:46.759 --> 15:48.359
Lady Gaga.

15:48.394 --> 15:49.127
Who?

15:49.161 --> 15:50.462
Katy Perry?

15:50.496 --> 15:51.863
The governor of Texas?

15:51.898 --> 15:54.065
Okay, l... Never mind.

15:54.099 --> 15:55.300
Listen. Just trust me.

15:55.334 --> 15:57.335
We're putting on a huge show
in Glee Club, and I need you

15:57.369 --> 15:59.237
to get the word out to all
the McKinley Monsters, okay?

15:59.271 --> 16:00.337
All right, fine.

16:00.371 --> 16:04.007
Whatever. I'll do it
if you just shut up!

16:04.042 --> 16:05.843
(groans)

16:05.877 --> 16:08.579
That was rude.

16:08.613 --> 16:11.482
So, Santana showed me
Starchild's

16:11.516 --> 16:12.850
amazing audition video,

16:12.884 --> 16:15.085
Ah. And she said that
you passed on him

16:15.119 --> 16:16.519
because you didn't want to share

16:16.554 --> 16:18.855
the "lavender limelight"
with anyone.

16:18.889 --> 16:20.490
Rachel, it's a band, all right?

16:20.524 --> 16:22.024
If I was afraid of sharing
the limelight with someone,

16:22.059 --> 16:23.492
I would do a solo show
at the Duplex

16:23.526 --> 16:25.393
about my obsession
with Broadway divas.

16:25.428 --> 16:27.830
Why did you do that? You know,
he's really something special.

16:27.864 --> 16:30.365
(sighs) Like I said
before, Starchild's look,

16:30.399 --> 16:33.335
it's just too... edgy,
I-it's too out there.

16:33.369 --> 16:35.036
It's-it's not what I want
for this band.

16:35.071 --> 16:36.672
Okay, and what is that, exactly?
I don't know.

16:36.706 --> 16:39.074
Mainstream acceptance
and success, for once.

16:39.108 --> 16:41.843
Look, I've been doing this
"weirdo, quirky, fabulous,

16:41.877 --> 16:44.411
"outrageous, sidekick, best
friend" thing for a while now,

16:44.446 --> 16:45.847
and it hasn't
gotten me very far.

16:45.881 --> 16:47.882
It got you to New York,
it got you into NYADA.

16:47.916 --> 16:49.584
Does that give me
financial security?

16:49.618 --> 16:51.018
A mass audience?

16:51.052 --> 16:52.419
A song on the radio?

16:52.454 --> 16:53.521
Since when
is that what you want?

16:53.555 --> 16:54.856
Maybe since I moved to New York

16:54.890 --> 16:56.691
and saw one of my friends
book a Broadway show

16:56.724 --> 16:58.324
and another one,
a national commercial.

16:58.359 --> 16:59.793
Look, Rachel,

16:59.827 --> 17:01.461
there's nothing wrong
with wanting to be

17:01.496 --> 17:02.829
that thing that everyone likes,

17:02.864 --> 17:05.231
that thing that everyone
wants to see and hear

17:05.265 --> 17:07.534
and that doesn't offend
or challenge anyone.

17:07.568 --> 17:10.369
No, that's not you.
You're way more specific.

17:10.404 --> 17:11.871
Which is code for fringe,

17:11.905 --> 17:13.873
which is code for unsuccessful,

17:13.906 --> 17:15.540
which is code for,
"You'll never make it

17:15.575 --> 17:17.242
in the big leagues, kid.
Stop trying."

17:17.276 --> 17:19.845
I know it's not my band, so I'm
not gonna tell you what to do.

17:19.880 --> 17:21.413
But as your best friend
and your biggest fan,

17:21.446 --> 17:23.348
what I love the most about you

17:23.383 --> 17:24.916
is that you don't try
to do or be

17:24.951 --> 17:28.051
what anyone else is doing, okay?
You make your own path.

17:28.086 --> 17:29.721
(sighs)

17:29.755 --> 17:31.523
It's so hard sometimes.
I know.

17:31.557 --> 17:34.091
But it's gonna be worth it
in the long run, I promise you.

17:34.126 --> 17:36.227
Your brand, it's gonna be huge.

17:36.261 --> 17:38.029
Look at Madonna. She was
performing in the East Village,

17:38.063 --> 17:40.264
and then she was
on the Super Bowl, okay?

17:40.298 --> 17:42.199
That's gonna be you...
I know it.

17:42.234 --> 17:44.735
You are a true talent, Kurt,

17:44.769 --> 17:48.005
but I think, you know,
that Starchild might be as well.

17:48.039 --> 17:49.406
And, luckily,
it might not be too late

17:49.440 --> 17:50.473
for you to call him back.

17:52.443 --> 17:53.777
I wish. I...

17:53.811 --> 17:55.412
don't even have
his phone number.

17:55.446 --> 17:57.347
Or his real name.

17:57.381 --> 17:59.349
I'm so excited
for this weekend.

17:59.383 --> 18:02.885
Me, too. I was thinking we
could add a little edge to it.

18:02.920 --> 18:04.687
Okay. Oh, I know!
Mm-hmm?

18:04.721 --> 18:06.355
I can get us
some John Mayer tickets.

18:06.389 --> 18:08.457
He's supposed
to be amazing live.

18:08.491 --> 18:11.861
Uh, well, I'm-I'm
sure he is, but...

18:11.895 --> 18:13.696
Yeah, it'll be fun.
Can't wait.

18:13.730 --> 18:14.864
Mwah.

18:14.898 --> 18:17.799
Well, well,
look at these two cuties.

18:17.833 --> 18:20.035
Jake, I just wanted to mention

18:20.069 --> 18:22.370
that the Cheerios! Are working
on something big

18:22.404 --> 18:25.040
and could really use your
silky smooth dance moves

18:25.074 --> 18:28.409
that make an awkward attempt
at combining hip-hop and ballet.

18:28.444 --> 18:29.811
You're the best dancer
in this hellhole,

18:29.845 --> 18:31.645
and I need you to help me
choreograph a number.

18:31.680 --> 18:35.082
Thanks, Bree, but I'm not really
a choreographer.

18:35.116 --> 18:36.516
Babe, no, you should do it.

18:36.551 --> 18:38.418
You love it
and you're so good at that.

18:38.453 --> 18:40.087
Really?
Mm-hmm.

18:40.121 --> 18:42.255
Okay, sure. Why not? I'm in.

18:42.290 --> 18:43.523
Bad-ass.

18:43.558 --> 18:45.525
I'll text you rehearsal dates.

18:45.560 --> 18:47.561
'Kay. Thanks. Bye.

18:50.030 --> 18:51.831
(chuckles)

18:51.865 --> 18:54.433
And a fun fact:
the name "Ohio" originates

18:54.468 --> 18:55.868
from the Iroquois word

18:55.903 --> 18:58.304
<i>"ohi-yo',"</i>
<i>meaning "good river."</i>

18:58.338 --> 19:00.473
SUE:
Attention, McKinley idiots.

19:00.507 --> 19:01.874
Here are
your morning announcements

19:01.909 --> 19:03.875
that I didn't do earlier
because I was busy

19:03.910 --> 19:06.812
publicly breast-feeding my baby
at Starbucks.

19:06.846 --> 19:09.047
Once again,
it's flea and tick season.

19:09.082 --> 19:12.784
Please be sure to thoroughly
inspect your overly hormonal,

19:12.819 --> 19:14.019
acne-riddled bodies.

19:14.053 --> 19:17.155
(discordant notes playing)

19:17.189 --> 19:21.792
BECKY: I am one of Mother
Monster's devoted disciples,

19:21.827 --> 19:25.029
and I command you to open
your laptops immediately.

19:25.063 --> 19:27.531
(discordant notes playing
over P.A. system)

19:29.668 --> 19:33.370
(loud booing on video)

19:33.404 --> 19:36.039
(techno beat starts)

19:46.216 --> 19:48.551
I don't understand this video!

19:56.425 --> 19:58.426
(music winds down, stops)

20:00.229 --> 20:01.697
Th... I mean, it's just
a little teaser video

20:01.731 --> 20:03.065
you know,
to get everybody psyched

20:03.099 --> 20:04.199
for our Gaga performance.

20:04.233 --> 20:05.600
It's at 3:30.

20:05.635 --> 20:07.569
Uh, I saw.
(chuckles)

20:07.603 --> 20:09.403
So, are you gonna come?

20:09.437 --> 20:10.571
I can't.

20:10.605 --> 20:12.206
I'm getting a new piercing.

20:12.240 --> 20:13.207
What? Where?

20:13.241 --> 20:14.375
Oh! On my ear.

20:14.409 --> 20:16.778
Oh, well, th... cool.
That's... yeah.

20:16.812 --> 20:19.446
That's weird, you know,
'cause I was actually planning

20:19.481 --> 20:21.549
on getting multiple
ear piercings this weekend.

20:21.583 --> 20:23.750
We should do it together. That way, you
know, you could catch our show today.

20:23.785 --> 20:26.053
You know, 'cause it's gonna be
really crazy, like Gaga crazy.

20:26.087 --> 20:29.122
Especially me, you know, 'cause
I'm all totally edgy and stuff.

20:29.157 --> 20:30.557
- Mmm.
- So?

20:30.591 --> 20:32.458
What do you say? Yes? No? Yes?

20:32.493 --> 20:34.427
- Yes? Yes?
- Sure.

20:37.244 --> 20:39.797
Okay. I'm thinking of lions
and tigers.

20:39.823 --> 20:42.490
We'll unleash them from the zoo.
Now, that's "Roar."

20:42.525 --> 20:45.059
I want to whip the audience and
make them our slaves.

20:45.093 --> 20:47.495
Let's reenact a
baby's birth onstage!

20:47.530 --> 20:50.431
Ooh, we can float in giant
plastic bags of amniotic fluid.

20:50.465 --> 20:51.833
Puckerman!

20:51.867 --> 20:52.767
Are you awake?

20:52.769 --> 20:54.769
We've been at this
for five hours.

20:54.803 --> 20:56.269
And we'll be at it
five more hours

20:56.303 --> 20:57.604
until we come up
with the perfect idea.

20:57.606 --> 20:58.939
Okay. Later.

20:58.973 --> 21:00.541
Where do you think you're
going?

21:00.575 --> 21:01.608
To the dance studio.

21:01.643 --> 21:02.776
I'm helping the Cheerios

21:02.810 --> 21:04.144
with some choreography.

21:04.178 --> 21:05.546
Who talked you into doing that?

21:05.580 --> 21:06.613
Let me guess.

21:06.648 --> 21:07.614
(mockingly):
Bree.

21:07.649 --> 21:10.050
She is the most vile

21:10.084 --> 21:11.717
human being on this planet.

21:11.752 --> 21:14.319
And, yes, I know that is saying
something, coming from me.

21:22.696 --> 21:25.330
(school bell rings) Marley.

21:25.365 --> 21:27.166
I'm not saying that Jake's
on the verge of cheating,

21:27.200 --> 21:28.433
but I'm not not saying it.

21:28.467 --> 21:30.334
Like my Aunt Felicia
always says,

21:30.369 --> 21:31.770
a tiger can't change
his stripes.

21:31.804 --> 21:33.104
Especially when that
tiger's a man slut.

21:33.138 --> 21:35.173
Jake's not like that. Not anymore.
(sighs)

21:35.207 --> 21:38.242
I know he loves you and you <i>love</i>
<i>him, but that was pre-Bree.</i>

21:38.277 --> 21:40.745
That girl is poison.
She is whack like crack,

21:40.780 --> 21:42.080
a penis flytrap, Marley.

21:42.114 --> 21:44.648
She will chew him up.

♪ Preach. ♪

21:45.884 --> 21:47.517

21:49.955 --> 21:51.955
Great. What am I supposed
to do? I'm not like that.

21:51.957 --> 21:54.357
I'm not that kind of girl. This
is your week to fight back.

21:54.392 --> 21:55.859
You need to go full Gaga
and show them both

21:55.894 --> 21:57.054
that you can be hardcore, too.

21:57.062 --> 21:58.596
I'm not gonna get paranoid
about Jake.

21:58.630 --> 22:01.631
Either he wants to be
with the real me or he can go.

Well, get over yourself...
you think I'm just

24:34.608 --> 24:35.708
comfortable up here
with no shirt on!

24:35.743 --> 24:37.043
Yeah, you probably are.

24:37.077 --> 24:38.811
Well, I'm not exactly loving
this giant white thing

24:38.846 --> 24:40.312
that keeps getting caught
in my wheels.

24:40.347 --> 24:41.948
Yeah, and I look like
Siegfried <i>and</i> Roy,

24:41.982 --> 24:43.049
and I still did it.

24:43.083 --> 24:44.217
It <i>was</i> the assignment.

24:44.251 --> 24:45.384
Okay, I'm sorry, you guys,

24:45.418 --> 24:46.619
but I am who I am,

24:46.653 --> 24:48.620
and I'm not gonna
change that for any number

24:48.654 --> 24:50.789
- or any guy. - WILL: Marley,
we're all trying

24:50.823 --> 24:52.624
to win a championship here,
as a team,

24:52.658 --> 24:54.692
but you put your personal
agenda above that.

24:54.727 --> 24:55.894
I'm sorry, but...

24:55.928 --> 24:57.896
you're suspended
for the rest of the week.

25:01.868 --> 25:03.534
Oh, snap!

25:11.009 --> 25:12.185
Are you freaking kidding me?

25:12.197 --> 25:13.430
You just see what they did.

25:13.449 --> 25:14.969
I have literally
giving you...

25:16.327 --> 25:17.117
This is not going to work.

25:17.128 --> 25:19.897
- Stop it.
- Guys, we need to focus!

25:19.932 --> 25:21.933
It is now the day of,
and we still don't have

25:21.967 --> 25:23.601
a strong plan for this
Katy song, and I think

25:23.635 --> 25:25.335
- it's pretty obvious what the problem is.
- Uh, because

25:25.370 --> 25:27.437
we're a bunch of Gagas
trying to out-Katy the Katys

25:27.471 --> 25:28.939
who just did a Gaga song
featuring Marley

25:28.973 --> 25:30.106
as Katy?

25:30.140 --> 25:31.608
Besides, we did have a plan,

25:31.642 --> 25:33.509
but King Latifah
dropped the ball.

25:33.544 --> 25:35.344
Uh-uh. Let me
auto-correct that for you.

25:35.379 --> 25:37.513
I tried breaking into the zoo
to get us live tigers.

25:37.548 --> 25:39.115
Plot twist:
Lima doesn't have a zoo!

25:39.149 --> 25:40.349
Why'd we think it did?

25:40.384 --> 25:41.985
But I did get us a lion costume

25:42.019 --> 25:43.151
to make up for it.
Didn't I?

25:49.025 --> 25:50.158
(heavy sigh)

25:50.193 --> 25:52.061
I'm really not okay with this.

25:52.095 --> 25:53.562
Guys, the real problem is,
we're thinking

25:53.597 --> 25:55.263
gimmicks and
spectacle, and, yes,

25:55.298 --> 25:57.232
both Katy and Gaga
share that, but...

25:57.266 --> 26:00.635
what people love about Katy's
music is it's fun and kind

26:00.669 --> 26:02.570
and real and girl-next-door.

26:02.605 --> 26:03.972
We need to strip it down.

26:04.006 --> 26:06.040
No costumes,
no special effects,

26:06.075 --> 26:08.910
no gimmicks...
just the music.

26:11.013 --> 26:12.113
Seriously,

26:12.147 --> 26:14.015
I look like a gay Thundercat.

26:20.354 --> 26:22.122
Hello.
Welcome to the Spotlight.

26:22.156 --> 26:25.125
I'm Kurt, I'll be
your Chorus Boy waiter today.

26:25.159 --> 26:28.962
Could I start you off with one
of our signature Orange Freezes?

26:28.997 --> 26:31.163
First, uh, can I
ask you something?

26:31.197 --> 26:33.298
Is this toned down enough?

26:33.333 --> 26:34.967
Oh, my God... Starchild.

26:35.002 --> 26:36.902
(chuckles)
It's Elliot Gilbert, actually.

26:36.937 --> 26:38.403
(laughs quietly)

26:38.438 --> 26:40.973
Do you have a minute to talk?
Yeah, I-I'm taking

26:41.008 --> 26:42.141
an intermission.

26:42.175 --> 26:44.010
Okay, uh, that's how we say.

26:44.044 --> 26:45.444
"I'm taking a break" here.

26:45.478 --> 26:47.598
We have to say it that way,
otherwise we get fined. Mm.

26:47.613 --> 26:49.014
Uh, I'm so happy to see you.

26:49.048 --> 26:50.682
I've been trying to find you
since your audition.

26:50.716 --> 26:52.951
Yeah, same.
Uh, hence my stalking you.

26:52.985 --> 26:55.286
(chuckles) So, I'm just gonna
come right out and say this.

26:55.320 --> 26:57.956
Uh... I need to be
in your band.

26:57.990 --> 27:00.025
I mean, I came to New York
to be in your band.

27:00.059 --> 27:02.293
Something cool and
fun and-and special.

27:02.327 --> 27:04.695
Well, here's hopin'.
Um, came from where?

27:04.729 --> 27:06.864
Uh, if you say Ohio,
I'm gonna die.

27:06.898 --> 27:08.398
Paramus, New Jersey.

27:08.432 --> 27:09.700
Land of malls.

27:09.734 --> 27:11.035
Oh. As soon as I was old enough,

27:11.069 --> 27:13.203
I used to take New Jersey
Transit into the city

27:13.237 --> 27:16.473
to see shows and concerts
and go to museums.

27:16.507 --> 27:18.208
So I only applied to
colleges in New York.

27:18.242 --> 27:20.877
- Oh, do you go to NYADA, too?
- No. NYU.

27:20.911 --> 27:23.079
Oh. I... didn't get in to NYADA.

27:23.113 --> 27:26.049
- Yeah? - But it's cool. I mean, I'm
doing things all over the city,

27:26.083 --> 27:28.751
and one of the things on
my artist's bucket list

27:28.786 --> 27:30.386
is to be in an indie band.

27:30.420 --> 27:32.454
So, if...

27:32.489 --> 27:34.790
Starchild's too much for you...

27:34.824 --> 27:36.558
I can be whoever you want.

27:36.592 --> 27:38.927
(chuckles) I just wanted
to make an impression.

27:38.961 --> 27:40.062
You did.

27:40.096 --> 27:41.897
And after a lot
of soul-searching,

27:41.931 --> 27:44.066
I've come to the conclusion
that the greatest chance

27:44.100 --> 27:46.968
for my band and my-my brand
to be successful

27:47.003 --> 27:49.071
is to surround myself
with the best people.

27:49.105 --> 27:50.605
And although there
wasn't much of it,

27:50.639 --> 27:53.174
you blew the competition away.

27:53.208 --> 27:54.875
(laughs) So I can
audition again?

27:54.910 --> 27:56.711
No.

27:56.745 --> 27:58.345
You're in.
As Elliot Gilbert,

27:58.379 --> 28:00.848
as Starchild,
or someone in between.

28:00.882 --> 28:02.850
Whoever you want to be.
SANTANA: Intermission's over.

28:02.884 --> 28:05.019
And you have a fiancé,
so stop flirting.

28:05.053 --> 28:07.553
Santana, this is Elliot Gilbert,

28:07.588 --> 28:09.622
AKA Starchild.

28:09.656 --> 28:10.957
Oh, well, hot damn!

28:10.991 --> 28:12.058
(chuckles)

28:12.093 --> 28:14.594
And I hope the newest
member of our band.

28:16.997 --> 28:19.099
(school bell ringing)

28:20.667 --> 28:22.968
Hey, uh, you disappeared
after our show.

28:23.002 --> 28:23.969
What'd you think?

28:24.003 --> 28:25.971
Mmm... well,
I really liked the part

28:26.005 --> 28:27.405
where the girl got suspended.

28:27.440 --> 28:30.575
No, I... about our... what'd
you think about our number?

28:30.610 --> 28:32.911
I didn't hate it.

28:32.946 --> 28:35.447
Okay, I kind of did. But it's
nothing against you, though.

28:35.481 --> 28:37.616
Lady Gaga just isn't my thing.

28:37.650 --> 28:38.983
She's just too dark for me.

28:39.017 --> 28:40.985
I thought you said you
had a musical dark side.

28:41.019 --> 28:43.955
I lied. My exes have
musical dark sides.

28:43.989 --> 28:45.790
Ever since preschool,
people have said,

28:45.824 --> 28:48.492
sure, Penny Owen has beautiful,
wavy, sun-kissed hair,

28:48.526 --> 28:50.327
but she's just so vanilla.

28:50.362 --> 28:53.064
So I started dating bad boys,
and bad boys can be fun

28:53.098 --> 28:55.899
until they steal your heart,
and your car,

28:55.933 --> 28:57.173
and everything
out of your dorm.

28:57.201 --> 28:58.735
I'm done with bad boys.

28:58.770 --> 29:00.070
And my favorite artists

29:00.104 --> 29:01.905
are mainstream
singer-songwriters,

29:01.939 --> 29:04.841
like Carrie Underwood,
Bruno Mars and Katy Perry.

29:04.876 --> 29:06.676
Me, too! Oh, my gosh,
I am so not a Gaga.

29:06.710 --> 29:08.779
Oh! I love Katy Perry.
I'm such a Katy.

29:08.813 --> 29:10.846
Oh, it just feels so good
to say it out loud.

29:10.881 --> 29:12.948
I... I also still like
the Jonas Brothers.

29:12.983 --> 29:14.917
- I still like the Biebs.
- No.

29:14.951 --> 29:18.020
You know, Katy Perry's
going on tour next year.

29:18.054 --> 29:21.257
You want to hit up a concert with
me, if she ever comes to Ohio?

29:21.291 --> 29:23.425
Uh, y... sure,
yeah, sure, yeah.

29:23.459 --> 29:25.194
Uh, but why wait a year?

29:25.228 --> 29:27.628
Some of the Glee Club are
doing a Katy jam today.

29:27.663 --> 29:29.297
Oh, yeah, that could be...

29:35.271 --> 29:37.005

JAKE: Well, I haven't seen
a Katy this sad since

32:53.227 --> 32:55.461
the Russell Brand breakup
scene in <i>Part of Me.</i>

32:55.495 --> 32:57.062
I know. I'm sorry.

32:57.097 --> 32:59.698
I just can't believe
I wasn't allowed in there

32:59.732 --> 33:01.032
to watch your performance.

33:01.066 --> 33:03.702
I've never been suspended
before.

33:03.736 --> 33:05.570
I've never even been
in trouble for anything.

33:05.605 --> 33:06.904
Well, I have.

33:06.939 --> 33:09.040
Plenty, actually.
Yeah, but...

33:09.074 --> 33:10.875
Hey, listen, why don't you
come over after school today?

33:10.909 --> 33:12.711
Okay? We'll do
something fun.

33:12.745 --> 33:13.945
My mom has <i>Mary Poppins</i> on DVD.

33:13.946 --> 33:14.946
(chuckles)

33:14.980 --> 33:16.247
Thank you.

33:16.249 --> 33:18.616
Okay, I'll go home and
change first.

33:18.650 --> 33:20.751
No, don't. I'm kind of digging
this whole Katy vibe.

33:20.818 --> 33:21.785
Seriously?

33:22.754 --> 33:23.787
Even the wig?

33:23.789 --> 33:26.423
Especially the wig.

33:26.458 --> 33:28.626
Oh And my mom's working
a double shift,

33:28.660 --> 33:30.827
so she won't be home
until way, way late.

33:30.862 --> 33:33.329
Um, sure.

33:56.319 --> 33:58.320
(grunts) Jake, stop.

34:04.593 --> 34:05.726
(sighs)

34:05.761 --> 34:08.896
Can we have an honest
conversation about this?

34:08.929 --> 34:11.965
The whole point to being
boyfriend/girlfriend

34:12.000 --> 34:15.235
is that we hang out
and spend all this time together

34:15.270 --> 34:17.571
so that we can appreciate
and trust each other.

34:17.606 --> 34:19.572
I totally appreciate
and trust you.

34:19.607 --> 34:20.766
And what better place is there

34:20.775 --> 34:23.443
to explore certain aspects
of ourselves than here?

34:23.476 --> 34:26.279
Are you telling me that the only
reason you hang out with me

34:26.313 --> 34:28.947
and all that is just
so I'll let you touch my boobs?

34:28.982 --> 34:31.284
What? No. No, no.
Of course not.

34:31.319 --> 34:33.386
But I feel like you won't even
consider it.

34:33.420 --> 34:35.721
Like you don't care
that it's bumming me out.

34:35.755 --> 34:37.956
Well, what do you want me to do? I
just don't want to be pressured

34:37.989 --> 34:39.558
into doing something
I don't want to do!

34:39.592 --> 34:41.560
Who is pressuring you, Marley?

34:41.594 --> 34:42.628
I have been the most patient.

34:42.661 --> 34:43.728
The most understanding.

34:43.763 --> 34:45.464
I mean, I used
to stop calling a girl

34:45.498 --> 34:47.299
if she didn't let me
in her pants after six hours.

34:47.333 --> 34:49.935
Ugh! Then go be
with one of those girls!

34:49.969 --> 34:51.601
Go! Have fun!

34:59.110 --> 35:01.111
(sighs)

35:15.660 --> 35:17.293
Hey.

35:17.328 --> 35:19.663
Do you... want to go somewhere?

35:20.732 --> 35:22.466
Where?

35:22.500 --> 35:24.633
Someplace... private.

35:24.668 --> 35:26.068
Really private.

35:27.103 --> 35:29.605
A private part of the school?

35:30.674 --> 35:32.441
I like private parts.

35:33.510 --> 35:35.778
Is your girlfriend going
to be there?

35:36.580 --> 35:39.381
Do you want to go or not?

35:39.415 --> 35:41.315
(chuckles)

35:41.350 --> 35:42.717
I'll get my coat.

35:42.752 --> 35:45.319
We'll need something
to lay on the ground.

35:45.354 --> 35:48.857
I don't want to get grass stains
on my uniform.

35:59.892 --> 36:04.059
What if we name our band
the Nipslips?

36:04.099 --> 36:05.532
Boob lovers of all genders

36:05.567 --> 36:07.335
will show up for sure.

36:07.369 --> 36:09.236
Um, it worked
for the Barenaked Ladies.

36:09.271 --> 36:10.838
- And they were guys.
- Sure,

36:10.872 --> 36:12.573
we'll just call ourselves
the Areolas.

36:12.607 --> 36:15.241
Nope. Areola 51...
get the sci-fi geeks.

36:15.276 --> 36:16.542
I was being sarcastic.

36:16.577 --> 36:18.178
No, you were actually
just being the No-bot.

36:18.212 --> 36:20.013
How 'bout you pitch something
instead of shooting down

36:20.047 --> 36:21.381
everything that
we're coming up with?

36:21.415 --> 36:22.582
Okay, I don't have it yet.

36:22.616 --> 36:23.749
But I'll know it when I hear it.

36:23.784 --> 36:25.585
(sighs) (door slides open)

36:25.619 --> 36:27.587
SANTANA: Oh, yo, girl.
How was rehearsal?

36:27.621 --> 36:29.889
It was sad.
I sang "My Man" all day,

36:29.923 --> 36:31.590
which was kind of depressing.

36:31.624 --> 36:33.592
Aw. We have comfort food
if you want a slice.

36:33.626 --> 36:34.893
No, I'm good.
What are you guys doing?

36:34.927 --> 36:36.628
Beating our heads up against
the wall trying to come up

36:36.662 --> 36:38.897
with a name for our band
that pleases the queen.

36:38.931 --> 36:41.233
(chuckles)
Why don't you call yourselves...

36:41.267 --> 36:43.102
Pamela Lansbury?

36:44.937 --> 36:46.705
No... I was kidding.

36:46.739 --> 36:48.572
Rachel, you're a genius.

36:48.607 --> 36:51.675
A band with the raw sex appeal
of Pamela Anderson

36:51.710 --> 36:52.843
and the quiet dignity

36:52.878 --> 36:54.045
of Angela Lansbury.

36:54.079 --> 36:55.513
Mm-hmm.
Okay, now you have to join.

36:55.547 --> 36:57.415
No, I can't. I told you.

36:57.449 --> 36:59.183
Rachel, I'm serious, okay?

36:59.218 --> 37:00.584
No more <i>Funny Girl</i> excuses.

37:00.619 --> 37:02.420
When Barbra was doing Fanny,

37:02.454 --> 37:03.420
she still had time to sing

37:03.454 --> 37:04.521
for the President
and Ladybird Johnson,

37:04.555 --> 37:06.689
pose for the cover
of <i>Tim</i> magazine,

37:06.724 --> 37:08.058
and sing "Happy Days
Are Here Again"

37:08.092 --> 37:10.093
to adoring nightclub audiences
all around the country.

37:10.128 --> 37:11.561
Now, you can do this.

37:11.595 --> 37:14.398
Okay, you had me
at Ladybird Johnson.

37:14.432 --> 37:15.432
Yes!
(everyone cheering)

37:15.466 --> 37:17.067
- Yay!
- Yeah!

37:17.101 --> 37:18.402
Okay.

37:18.436 --> 37:19.768
Okay.

37:19.802 --> 37:21.237
Let's get to work.

37:21.271 --> 37:23.172
And that's why math and music

37:23.206 --> 37:24.573
will be friends to the end.

37:24.607 --> 37:25.574
(door opens) You guys!

37:25.608 --> 37:27.743
Throat Explosion
just tweeted out

37:27.777 --> 37:30.246
that they're doing "Applause" as
one of their Nationals numbers!

37:30.280 --> 37:31.447
So? Big deal.

37:31.481 --> 37:32.515
We'll just do another
Lady Gaga song.

37:32.549 --> 37:33.582
They're mocking us.

37:33.616 --> 37:34.917
They're saying
they're so confident

37:34.951 --> 37:35.850
they're gonna win,
they're even gonna give us

37:35.884 --> 37:37.252
a little head start
by telling us

37:37.286 --> 37:38.453
what their set list is.

37:38.487 --> 37:40.588
Seriously!
We should just forfeit now.

37:40.622 --> 37:42.357
Guys, guys!
Just calm down.

37:42.391 --> 37:44.859
So our completion is good,
so was Vocal Adrenaline.

37:44.893 --> 37:45.793
And the Warblers.

37:45.827 --> 37:46.894
And thank God for that.

37:46.929 --> 37:48.530
If there's anything
we can learn

37:48.564 --> 37:49.797
from this week's lesson,

37:49.831 --> 37:50.631
it's that
other people's greatness

37:50.666 --> 37:51.798
makes our greatness
even greater.

37:51.832 --> 37:53.400
Gaga and Katy,
they push each other

37:53.435 --> 37:55.735
to try harder, to get
better, to be bolder.

37:55.770 --> 37:57.071
At the end of the day,

37:57.105 --> 37:58.572
all of the friendly
competition between those two

37:58.606 --> 38:01.341
just means more really
amazing music for all of us.

38:01.376 --> 38:03.577
I mean, I hope Throat Explosion
is unstoppable,

38:03.611 --> 38:06.746
because then we know
we have to be unstoppable too.

38:06.781 --> 38:08.081
You think he had that
in mind all week,

38:08.115 --> 38:09.682
or did he just make
it up on the spot?

38:09.716 --> 38:11.584
What are you talking about?
Mr. Shuester's a genius.

38:11.618 --> 38:13.919
This week, we saw what it was
like to face our weaknesses

38:13.954 --> 38:15.088
and turn them into strengths...
we split up.

38:15.122 --> 38:16.422
But now, for our last number,

38:16.457 --> 38:18.757
we are going to come together
as one unified group.

38:18.792 --> 38:21.260
Oh... please let it be
another Journey song.

38:21.295 --> 38:22.661
(laughs)
There's gotta be one left.

38:22.696 --> 38:23.661
(laughing)

38:23.696 --> 38:25.497
Hello, Glee Club.

38:25.531 --> 38:27.765
- Hi, William.
- Sue.

38:27.800 --> 38:30.168
You know,
I was sitting in my office

38:30.203 --> 38:32.036
organizing my collection of

38:32.071 --> 38:33.572
custom-made bobble heads
of my sworn enemies,

38:33.606 --> 38:36.341
and just to the right of
Henry Kissinger and Drake,

38:36.375 --> 38:39.510
well, I saw your hair helmet
just bobbling up and down

38:39.544 --> 38:41.345
and I realized, well,
I haven't marched in here

38:41.379 --> 38:44.014
and brought down the
hammer in way too long.

38:44.048 --> 38:45.782
You're all suspended
for a week.

38:45.817 --> 38:48.352
What? Wait, Sue,
you can't...

38:48.386 --> 38:49.653
I can do that
and I just did it, William.

38:49.687 --> 38:52.022
There are rules about what
kids can wear to school

38:52.056 --> 38:54.458
and these rejects
from the cutting room floor

38:54.493 --> 38:55.658
of a Tod Browning movie

38:55.692 --> 38:56.959
are in violation of each
and every one of them.

38:56.994 --> 38:58.128
Okay, what rules?
I mean,

38:58.162 --> 38:59.462
the Glee Club has
been walking around

38:59.497 --> 39:01.197
in costumes for four years.

39:01.232 --> 39:03.799
Well, that was BS:
"Before Sue."

39:03.834 --> 39:05.635
One week suspension,
starting now.

39:05.669 --> 39:06.802
Sue, look it, look...

39:06.837 --> 39:08.671
we have four weeks
to prepare for Nationals.

39:08.705 --> 39:10.206
Right. We can't afford
to lose one of them.

39:10.241 --> 39:11.806
You said yourself
you wanted us to win.

39:11.841 --> 39:13.708
No, I said you have
to win to remain a club.

39:13.743 --> 39:15.410
I don't actually want
you to win, William.

39:15.445 --> 39:17.679
Are you seriously
starting up this feud again?

39:17.713 --> 39:19.681
Oh, it never ended, William.

39:19.715 --> 39:22.717
It's been hibernating like
a polar bear in winter.

39:22.752 --> 39:24.586
You know, Sue,
the problem with this war

39:24.621 --> 39:26.522
is that I always seem
to find a way to win it.

39:26.556 --> 39:28.356
Oh...
Yeah. Every time.

39:28.390 --> 39:30.558
And I wouldn't plan on that changing.
Well, I am principal.

39:30.592 --> 39:34.362
Which means there's only one
of us with an atomic bomb.

39:34.396 --> 39:36.764
- Bring it on, Sue.
- It is well brung.

39:36.798 --> 39:37.765
Yet again.

39:37.799 --> 39:38.866
It is brung.

39:38.900 --> 39:41.035
Fine... but you
better get ready

39:41.069 --> 39:42.537
to hear
the New Directions! Roar.

39:42.571 --> 39:44.271
Three, four!
(Katy Perry's "Roar" begins)

39:44.305 --> 39:45.539
Even though
I don't know your names,

39:45.573 --> 39:47.607
you band geeks
