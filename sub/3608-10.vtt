00:02.001 --> 00:03.586
Previously on Lost:

00:10.344 --> 00:13.304
- Are you sure you really want to?
- I've made my choice.

00:19.269 --> 00:22.021
- Where's it come from?
- Based on the maps, Nigeria.

00:22.106 --> 00:25.358
- Anyone on board?
- Two men dressed as priests.

00:25.442 --> 00:29.612
- Priests?
- Drug runners in disguise.

00:29.697 --> 00:32.656
The plane was loaded with heroin.

02:29.691 --> 02:31.234
Kill him.

02:34.196 --> 02:35.404
Shoot him. Now.

02:39.743 --> 02:41.244
Shoot him!

02:42.204 --> 02:43.538
Do it.

02:59.972 --> 03:04.767
What's your name, boy?

03:05.853 --> 03:07.854
Eko.

03:12.526 --> 03:16.195
Look at Mr. Eko. No hesitation.

03:17.197 --> 03:18.739
A born killer.

03:21.535 --> 03:23.536
Come.

03:25.622 --> 03:27.832
You won't need that anymore.

03:28.458 --> 03:29.959
Back.

03:56.653 --> 03:58.654
What are you writing?

04:03.493 --> 04:05.453
Things I need to remember.

04:06.788 --> 04:09.290
Do you mind if I sit?

04:09.374 --> 04:11.709
- Please.
- Thanks.

04:15.714 --> 04:19.175
- So, you're Eko, huh?
- Yes.

04:19.259 --> 04:23.137
Claire. And this is Aaron.

04:23.722 --> 04:27.099
Aaron? The brother of Moses.

04:27.184 --> 04:30.686
That must've been tough to live up to.

04:30.771 --> 04:35.983
Everyone saying, "Why can't you be
more like your brother Moses?"

04:36.068 --> 04:38.069
I'm sure it was.

04:40.447 --> 04:44.033
Why did you choose it? Aaron?

04:47.371 --> 04:49.997
I just liked it.

04:54.711 --> 04:58.089
Aaron was a great man.

04:58.173 --> 05:01.884
Moses had great difficulty speaking,

05:01.969 --> 05:04.887
so it was Aaron who spoke for him.

05:07.391 --> 05:08.933
So, you're religious, huh?

05:10.686 --> 05:12.645
You should speak to Charlie.

05:12.729 --> 05:15.189
He doesn't want to admit he's religious,

05:15.273 --> 05:20.111
but he carries around
a statue of the Virgin Mary.

05:21.863 --> 05:23.990
Statue?

05:24.074 --> 05:28.119
He said he found it on the island.
Weird, right?

05:29.579 --> 05:32.039
May I see it?

05:38.922 --> 05:42.174
- Where did he find this?
- He said he found it in the jungle.

05:42.259 --> 05:44.510
- Where in the jungle?
- I don't know.

05:44.594 --> 05:47.221
- Where?
- Why do you...?

05:47.305 --> 05:50.307
- It's just a statue.
- Just a statue?

06:03.864 --> 06:05.865
Where is Charlie?

06:39.107 --> 06:41.275
You breaking in or breaking out?

06:42.652 --> 06:47.239
I used to love those old silent movies
where the robbers would crack a lock

06:47.324 --> 06:50.618
with their ear pressed up
against the safe.

06:50.702 --> 06:54.747
The money they stole was always in a
white bag with a big dollar sign on it.

06:54.831 --> 06:58.084
Silent movies, huh?
You're not that old, man.

06:58.168 --> 07:01.962
- I'm old enough.
- You setting the combination?

07:02.047 --> 07:06.217
With the new folks joining us, we better
limit people's access to the guns.

07:06.301 --> 07:10.679
Can't have just anyone who wants one
walk in and help themselves.

07:10.764 --> 07:14.558
Which, I'm guessing,
is why you're here, Michael.

07:30.158 --> 07:33.202
Jin, do you like The Kinks?

07:34.287 --> 07:36.580
- Keens?
- No, the Kinks.

07:36.665 --> 07:39.291
With a "K" at the end.
A kicking "K." "K," Kinks?

07:44.965 --> 07:46.966
It's a good tune.

07:49.553 --> 07:52.471
Thank you very much.
I do have a beautiful voice.

08:00.397 --> 08:03.065
- Where did you find this?
- What happened?

08:03.150 --> 08:06.152
- Where did you find it?
- I found it in the jungle.

08:06.236 --> 08:09.405
Take me there.
This is not your business.

08:09.489 --> 08:14.326
- Take me to where you found it.
- Fine. We'll go for a stroll.

08:14.411 --> 08:16.662
There's nothing there. In the morning.

08:16.746 --> 08:18.664
We're going now.

08:19.749 --> 08:23.502
OK. Let me tell Claire,
so she doesn't get the wrong idea.

08:23.587 --> 08:25.379
Tell her on the way.

09:03.126 --> 09:05.794
Get us some beers. Go.

09:06.922 --> 09:10.007
- Where did you find this?
- What does it matter?

09:20.143 --> 09:22.770
- Same in the other bag?
- Yes.

09:39.204 --> 09:41.580
Fifty.

09:41.665 --> 09:43.666
Fifty what?

09:44.751 --> 09:49.129
Fifty is what I will pay you in exchange
for the favor you are asking me to do.

09:50.423 --> 09:51.507
A favor?

09:51.591 --> 09:53.759
You have a large quantity of heroin

09:53.843 --> 09:57.096
in a country that has no poppies
and no market for its sale.

09:57.180 --> 10:01.350
Your drugs are of no value here,
so you must get them out.

10:01.434 --> 10:06.021
The borders are all guarded
by the military, so you must fly.

10:06.106 --> 10:08.857
But as I am sure you are aware,

10:08.942 --> 10:12.528
the only private planes
currently allowed into the air

10:12.612 --> 10:16.365
are either UN aid
or the Catholic missionaries.

10:17.367 --> 10:20.536
And so you have come to me for a favor.

10:22.414 --> 10:25.791
I will buy your heroin.

10:25.875 --> 10:28.419
For 50.

10:41.558 --> 10:44.435
It is true what they say about you.

10:44.519 --> 10:48.355
- And what is that?
- You have no soul.

10:56.239 --> 10:57.781
No.

11:02.662 --> 11:07.541
Go.

11:09.127 --> 11:15.132
And tell your friends I let you live,
that Mr. Eko let you live.

11:24.309 --> 11:26.643
Just give me a second.

11:30.940 --> 11:33.567
Hi. Claire.

11:35.487 --> 11:38.864
- What happened to the statue?
- Don't play stupid.

11:38.948 --> 11:41.033
What?

11:41.117 --> 11:45.371
What's this?
Because this was in your little statue.

11:45.455 --> 11:49.416
Unless I'm mistaken, I remember
you saying you were a drug addict.

11:56.174 --> 11:58.467
I didn't know.

11:58.551 --> 12:01.678
If it's sealed up inside a statue,
how would I know?

12:03.681 --> 12:05.182
Claire?

12:05.642 --> 12:07.643
I'm not using.

12:08.770 --> 12:11.397
Look. Believe me now?

12:11.481 --> 12:14.316
I don't care.

12:16.069 --> 12:18.445
Someone's waiting for you.

12:30.291 --> 12:32.292
- Got it?
- Got it.

12:33.795 --> 12:39.091
Breath halfway out,
and gently squeeze the trigger.

12:39.175 --> 12:41.176
Squeeze.

12:42.053 --> 12:46.765
- Good.
- How'd you learn all this stuff?

12:46.850 --> 12:48.934
My dad used to take me hunting.

12:49.018 --> 12:52.354
- Hunting for what?
- Birds mostly.

12:54.190 --> 12:56.316
Of course, birds don't shoot back.

12:57.527 --> 12:58.902
Yeah.

13:00.321 --> 13:03.907
People are talking, thinking
I'm gonna go running off after Walt.

13:03.992 --> 13:06.743
If people are talking,
I'm not hearing it.

13:06.828 --> 13:10.038
But if I was,
I'd say it's not a very smart plan.

13:10.123 --> 13:12.124
Yeah, it's not.

13:14.043 --> 13:16.378
Let's try one for real.

13:31.478 --> 13:33.562
Bravo.

13:37.567 --> 13:39.568
Well done with Claire, mate.

13:39.652 --> 13:42.821
You got me in a lot of trouble there,
so thanks for that.

13:42.906 --> 13:44.907
I hope you're happy.

13:44.991 --> 13:47.075
That's right. You don't do happy.

13:49.871 --> 13:54.458
All right. Well, we're here.

13:54.542 --> 13:56.877
I found it right by that tree.

13:58.713 --> 14:03.008
- You found it here?
- Yeah. I found it here.

14:04.219 --> 14:06.220
You're lying.

14:09.057 --> 14:11.642
I don't even know you.

14:11.726 --> 14:15.437
You asked to see where I found it.
This is where I found it.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.814
We're done. Have a nice hike.

14:19.901 --> 14:22.653
You did not find the statue here.

14:26.032 --> 14:28.575
Take me to the plane.

14:34.165 --> 14:37.167
How did you know about the plane, man?

14:39.546 --> 14:41.547
It's old, you know.

14:42.215 --> 14:44.424
Been out in the jungle for years.

14:45.802 --> 14:49.638
Of course, you would know that.
You know everything.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.765
Why did you lie to the girl?

14:53.685 --> 14:54.685
What?

14:54.769 --> 14:58.355
You told her you did not know
what was inside the statue.

14:58.439 --> 15:01.984
- I wasn't lying.
- Then what is the wrong idea?

15:03.069 --> 15:04.069
What?

15:04.153 --> 15:07.489
When I showed you
the broken pieces of plaster,

15:07.574 --> 15:12.411
you said you did not want her
to get the wrong idea.

15:12.495 --> 15:14.538
What is the wrong idea?

15:16.332 --> 15:18.333
I don't have to tell you anything.

15:18.418 --> 15:22.421
You come traipsing across the island
and suddenly now you're in charge?

15:22.505 --> 15:24.506
You want me to take you to your plane?

15:24.591 --> 15:26.592
Start treating me with respect.

15:26.676 --> 15:28.677
I'm not just some guy you can just tr...

15:34.017 --> 15:38.937
What?

15:40.398 --> 15:41.607
Let's go.

15:44.152 --> 15:46.153
Yes, sir.

16:00.627 --> 16:03.962
Sir, if you buy a statue,

16:04.047 --> 16:07.633
the money will buy polio vaccine
for the village.

16:07.717 --> 16:09.843
300 naira, sir.

16:09.927 --> 16:11.928
What are you doing here?

16:19.604 --> 16:22.356
I have come to give my confession.

16:26.694 --> 16:28.945
Hello, Eko.

16:29.030 --> 16:31.198
Hello, Brother.

16:34.744 --> 16:37.371
I visit you
for the first time in three years

16:37.455 --> 16:40.666
and you won't hear my confession?

16:40.750 --> 16:44.753
Monsignor would have said he'd failed
to raise a proper Catholic boy.

16:44.837 --> 16:48.131
Why waste your time confessing?
It won't help you.

16:48.216 --> 16:49.591
- It won't?
- No.

16:49.676 --> 16:53.887
For confession to mean something,
you must have a penitent heart.

16:53.971 --> 16:56.640
You and your guilt, Yemi.

16:56.724 --> 17:01.019
I've only done what I needed to do
to survive. How is that a sin?

17:01.104 --> 17:03.105
You may live far from here,

17:03.189 --> 17:06.900
but I have heard of who you are
and what you have done.

17:13.825 --> 17:18.203
Have you forgotten how you got
that cross, the day they took me?

17:18.287 --> 17:20.997
Is what I did that day a sin?

17:21.082 --> 17:25.292
Or is it forgiven,
because it is you that was saved?

17:36.806 --> 17:39.307
Why are you here, Eko?

17:39.392 --> 17:41.393
I've come to help you.

17:42.645 --> 17:46.314
I have some merchandise
that I need to get out of the country.

17:46.399 --> 17:49.860
I would like one of your church
relief flights to transport it.

17:49.944 --> 17:53.113
Merchandise. You mean drugs.

17:54.532 --> 17:57.159
It is not my normal business.

17:57.243 --> 17:59.411
We are moving the drugs out of Nigeria

17:59.495 --> 18:02.706
so that they cannot be used
by our people.

18:02.790 --> 18:07.502
And you will have all the money
to buy your vaccine.

18:09.922 --> 18:14.760
God has given us this opportunity.
We should not turn our back on it.

18:14.844 --> 18:17.554
God did not bring you here, Eko.

18:17.638 --> 18:19.639
Your own greed did.

18:23.019 --> 18:25.020
I will always love you,

18:26.564 --> 18:28.899
but I will not help you.

18:35.031 --> 18:38.074
It was good to see you again, Brother.

18:51.088 --> 18:54.466
Little close to the ear.
Sure you know what you're doing?

18:54.550 --> 18:57.302
Would you please turn your head?

18:57.386 --> 19:00.055
You ain't got a clean enough shot
at my neck?

19:00.723 --> 19:02.641
I can cut my own damn hair.

19:02.725 --> 19:06.603
You don't have to be belligerent
just for belligerence's sake.

19:06.687 --> 19:08.605
Everyone loves you now.

19:09.232 --> 19:12.108
- Bull pucky.
- Yo, Sawyer.

19:12.985 --> 19:15.028
Glad you're back, man.

19:17.657 --> 19:20.575
Yo yourself, Pillsbury.

19:20.660 --> 19:21.993
You see?

19:22.078 --> 19:26.331
Kate, Locke said
you're on hatch duty later.

19:26.415 --> 19:30.460
I was wondering...
You mind if I go instead?

19:30.545 --> 19:34.172
- You want my shift?
- Help me take my mind off things.

19:35.883 --> 19:39.761
- Sure, it's all yours.
- Thanks. Appreciate it.

19:44.892 --> 19:47.394
Glad you're OK, man.

19:48.646 --> 19:49.688
Yeah.

19:56.946 --> 19:58.947
Don't even say it.

20:00.449 --> 20:03.952
All right. Time to take a break.

20:04.036 --> 20:06.037
Just had a break.

20:16.799 --> 20:19.551
I'm not what you think I am.

20:19.635 --> 20:22.596
What do I think you are?

20:23.472 --> 20:26.558
- It was my brother's fault.
- Sorry?

20:26.642 --> 20:29.436
It was his fault I became an addict.

20:29.520 --> 20:32.522
He started with the heroin.
I tried to make him stop.

20:33.316 --> 20:36.234
You don't know me, man.
I was a good person.

20:36.319 --> 20:39.279
I was an altar boy.

20:40.156 --> 20:44.034
I knew what was in that statue.
It doesn't mean I needed it.

20:44.118 --> 20:47.662
So don't judge me, man. Don't... Just...

20:51.834 --> 20:53.835
What?

21:02.970 --> 21:04.971
What's that?

21:07.391 --> 21:09.392
It's a parachute.

21:22.573 --> 21:24.908
Is that a priest?

21:30.373 --> 21:32.707
What're you doing?

21:46.555 --> 21:48.890
Do you know that guy?

21:51.352 --> 21:53.687
Yes.

21:53.771 --> 21:56.106
This man saved my life.

22:04.198 --> 22:08.451
Saved your life, huh?
Sure, that makes sense.

22:08.536 --> 22:13.164
He takes off in a plane in Nigeria.
We're in the South Pacific.

22:13.249 --> 22:15.583
That makes all the sense in the world.

22:27.596 --> 22:30.098
This is scripture written here.

22:33.853 --> 22:35.812
You're a priest, right?

22:35.896 --> 22:39.274
He's a priest
and you're a priest, too, right?

22:49.785 --> 22:51.828
I need to talk to you.

22:51.912 --> 22:55.665
- I'm in the middle of a confession.
- It cannot wait.

22:55.750 --> 22:56.833
God bless you.

22:56.917 --> 23:01.796
God be with you all.
Please, come back in the morning.

23:02.882 --> 23:04.883
It's OK.

23:10.306 --> 23:12.307
How dare you disrupt my work?

23:12.391 --> 23:14.559
Have you reconsidered my request?

23:14.643 --> 23:17.062
Flying drugs
under the cover of the Church?

23:17.146 --> 23:20.440
How could I ever reconsider?
Don't touch those.

23:20.524 --> 23:22.776
I am going to make this easy for you.

23:22.860 --> 23:26.071
You will make us priests
and we will fly the drugs out.

23:26.155 --> 23:29.365
- Make you priests?
- Sign these ordination documents.

23:29.450 --> 23:31.993
I will give you the money
for the vaccines.

23:33.245 --> 23:36.664
Leave this church now. Go. Now.

23:39.460 --> 23:42.462
Yemi, I understand
that you live in a world

23:42.546 --> 23:45.381
where righteousness and evil
seem very far apart,

23:45.466 --> 23:47.759
but that is not the real world.

23:49.303 --> 23:52.430
I am your brother,
I would never do anything to hurt you,

23:52.515 --> 23:56.226
but my friends,
if you do not do what I ask,

23:56.310 --> 23:59.354
they will burn this church
to the ground.

24:05.152 --> 24:09.614
Is that worth less than the price
of your name on a piece of paper?

24:14.161 --> 24:16.412
Think of the lives you will save.

24:34.723 --> 24:37.392
My signature does not make you a priest.

24:38.894 --> 24:40.728
You could never be a priest.

24:41.522 --> 24:44.774
How many of the Virgin Mary statues
do you have left?

24:44.859 --> 24:47.569
- I've 300.
- I will take all of them.

24:53.742 --> 24:55.910
I guess we are both sinners now.

24:59.290 --> 25:01.666
Perhaps we are,

25:01.750 --> 25:04.377
but God will forgive me.

25:27.526 --> 25:29.194
I'm lost.

25:29.278 --> 25:32.030
It was dark. I was following Sayid.

25:32.114 --> 25:34.199
A big bag of rocks fell on my head.

25:34.283 --> 25:39.454
I'm sorry if I'm a bit spotty
with the geography.

25:42.791 --> 25:45.710
- Climb that tree.
- What?

25:45.794 --> 25:49.130
Perhaps you will get your bearings
or see the plane.

25:52.843 --> 25:55.220
You climb it.

25:55.304 --> 25:58.723
What if I don't? You going to beat me
with your Jesus stick?

25:58.807 --> 26:02.227
I find it odd that your scripture stick
has dried blood on it.

26:02.311 --> 26:06.064
Are you going to climb that tree or not?

26:13.197 --> 26:16.199
What kind of priest are you, anyway?

26:37.346 --> 26:39.847
You need to get higher.

26:40.933 --> 26:43.977
Wonderful. Thank you.

27:12.715 --> 27:13.881
Run.

28:25.287 --> 28:27.955
- Did you see it?
- What the bloody hell did you do?

28:28.040 --> 28:29.207
I did nothing.

28:29.291 --> 28:33.211
When most people see a creature
made of swirling black smoke, they run.

28:33.295 --> 28:36.005
- I was not afraid of it.
- That thing kills people.

28:36.090 --> 28:39.884
- Did you see the plane?
- It's about a kilometer that way.

28:39.968 --> 28:41.969
Thank you.

28:42.763 --> 28:44.305
Wait.

29:16.505 --> 29:19.173
Come on.

29:21.677 --> 29:23.678
Where are you?

30:06.889 --> 30:09.182
Hey, Michael.

30:10.142 --> 30:12.685
- Hey.
- How you doing?

30:13.729 --> 30:16.230
I'm good, thanks.

30:17.316 --> 30:19.692
You down here alone?

30:19.776 --> 30:23.070
Yeah. Hurley's supposed to be here.

30:23.155 --> 30:25.656
But I guess he's running late.

30:30.746 --> 30:32.663
Listen...

30:36.502 --> 30:39.128
No one's forgotten about Walt.

30:40.756 --> 30:43.007
- What?
- I can't...

30:43.091 --> 30:46.594
I don't have any idea
what you must be going through.

30:46.678 --> 30:49.263
I just want you to know
that as soon as we can,

30:49.348 --> 30:53.893
we're gonna figure out a way
to go out and bring him back.

30:56.396 --> 30:57.438
Yeah.

30:58.982 --> 31:01.400
Thanks, man. Thanks.

31:05.656 --> 31:08.824
- You OK?
- I'm fine.

31:16.583 --> 31:18.668
I'll leave you to it, then.

31:20.170 --> 31:22.171
Thanks.

32:17.185 --> 32:18.519
Eko.

32:36.747 --> 32:39.248
- What are you doing here?
- I came to stop you.

32:39.333 --> 32:41.876
- Go to your church.
- Do not get on that plane.

32:41.960 --> 32:44.754
- I'm here to save your life.
- Save my life?

32:44.838 --> 32:47.798
- If you get on, if you do this...
- If I do what?

32:47.883 --> 32:51.677
- Are you a prophet now?
- Please, let me take your confession.

32:51.762 --> 32:55.723
Anything I can do, I will do.
But please, don't go.

33:02.564 --> 33:04.774
He told the military.

33:08.945 --> 33:11.822
- You did this?
- I did not tell them who was involved.

33:11.907 --> 33:14.950
Just leave the drugs
and come back with me.

33:27.506 --> 33:30.007
Stop. No more.

33:30.092 --> 33:31.342
Yemi.

33:33.053 --> 33:34.303
No.

33:36.598 --> 33:38.599
Help me get him in.

35:43.433 --> 35:45.434
Forgive me.

35:51.358 --> 35:53.359
Father?

35:57.864 --> 36:00.032
Are you OK, Father?

36:21.263 --> 36:22.346
Eko?

36:25.350 --> 36:27.017
Who's that?

36:29.688 --> 36:31.689
He's my brother.

36:41.867 --> 36:43.868
I'm sorry.

37:09.102 --> 37:11.103
For the one I broke.

37:44.554 --> 37:49.099
So, are you a priest or aren't you?

38:02.197 --> 38:04.198
Yes.

38:04.908 --> 38:06.909
I am.

38:10.538 --> 38:15.584
The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.

38:16.211 --> 38:20.130
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

38:20.215 --> 38:23.175
He leadeth me beside the still waters.

38:23.969 --> 38:26.428
He restoreth my soul.

38:27.263 --> 38:30.933
He leadeth me in the paths of
righteousness for his name's sake.

38:31.017 --> 38:35.479
Yea, though I walk through
the shadow of the valley of death,

38:35.563 --> 38:39.274
I fear no evil, for thou art with me.

38:39.359 --> 38:45.155
Thy rod, thy staff, they comfort me.

38:48.618 --> 38:52.329
Thou preparest a table before me

38:52.414 --> 38:55.916
in the presence of mine enemies,

38:56.001 --> 39:00.879
thou annointest my head with oil,

39:00.964 --> 39:04.174
my cup runneth over.

39:05.093 --> 39:08.971
Surely goodness and mercy
shall follow me,

39:09.055 --> 39:11.932
all the days of my life,

39:12.017 --> 39:18.022
and I will dwell in the house
of the Lord forever.

39:21.276 --> 39:22.860
Amen.

40:21.586 --> 40:22.669
Claire?

40:24.964 --> 40:27.299
You lied to me, Charlie.

40:31.930 --> 40:35.557
I know I did. I'm sorry.

40:38.603 --> 40:43.107
It just made me feel safer
to have it around.

40:43.191 --> 40:45.943
- I can't have you around my baby.
- Claire, I...

40:46.027 --> 40:48.779
I don't want you
sleeping anywhere near us.

40:55.161 --> 40:56.995
Just go.
