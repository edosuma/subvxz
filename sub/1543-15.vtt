WEBVTT

00:03.370 --> 00:06.010
So what is it, uh,
a spirit, demon, what?

00:08.041 --> 00:09.577
- I don't know.
- What is it?

00:10.410 --> 00:12.253
- I don't know.
- Yeah, we're goo positive.

00:12.412 --> 00:13.584
What does that mean?

00:14.515 --> 00:16.893
- It's not like it's an exact science.
- Ugh.

00:18.318 --> 00:19.422
Dude, what the hell?

00:20.921 --> 00:22.229
I don't know.

00:23.090 --> 00:24.592
No, seriously, what the hell?

00:25.592 --> 00:27.094
I don't know.

00:27.261 --> 00:29.605
- One theory, any theory.
- Uh...

00:30.597 --> 00:32.598
- Who are you?
- Name's Cole.

00:32.833 --> 00:36.781
I did two tours in Iraq. Special Ops,
Darfur. Your older brother Dean...

00:36.937 --> 00:38.245
Where is he?

00:38.405 --> 00:40.078
...he and I, we go way back.

00:40.574 --> 00:42.747
What I do is hunt monsters.

00:43.210 --> 00:46.783
You've got a family, Cole.
I'm guessing they need you to come back.

00:46.947 --> 00:48.893
And they need you to come back whole.

00:49.583 --> 00:51.756
- Dad!
- Dean Winchester murdered my father.

00:51.919 --> 00:54.456
That was not your father, Cole.
Your dad was a monster.

00:54.621 --> 00:56.623
- What kind of monster was he?
- I don't know.

00:56.790 --> 00:59.134
Never seen that kind before,
never seen it again.

02:29.316 --> 02:30.454
Hey, check it out.

02:30.651 --> 02:31.994
Hey.

02:33.887 --> 02:35.161
Porn?

02:35.355 --> 02:37.164
What? No, uh, it's nothing.

02:37.357 --> 02:39.997
Hey, look, no judgment from me.
Just not where we eat.

02:40.193 --> 02:41.228
Dude, it wasn't porn.

02:41.461 --> 02:46.308
Okay, erotica, whatever. Zip it up.
Check this out. Ahem.

02:47.401 --> 02:49.847
The vic was trained in
Krav Mega and jujitsu.

02:50.003 --> 02:51.914
Still ended up with her organs drained...

02:52.072 --> 02:55.019
...and the marrow was sucked
completely out of the bones.

02:56.009 --> 02:58.580
So cannibalism.

02:58.745 --> 03:00.247
You thinking a rougarou?

03:00.714 --> 03:02.921
Or a god, maybe.

03:04.418 --> 03:06.091
I'll go dig up my pencil-neck suit.

03:07.387 --> 03:09.060
Wait, wait, wait. What?

03:09.756 --> 03:11.599
What, is this not weird enough for you?

03:12.926 --> 03:15.600
Well, yeah, it's weird, but I mean, we...

03:16.396 --> 03:17.773
I mean...

03:18.498 --> 03:19.772
Right. Ah.

03:20.567 --> 03:22.945
Great. Ten minutes. Meet you in the car.

03:25.105 --> 03:26.607
Great.

03:37.617 --> 03:41.030
Sam. I know what you're doing
over there, and it ain't porn.

03:44.791 --> 03:48.739
Look, man, we have checked every website.
Okay? We've checked it twice.

03:49.763 --> 03:52.300
Sammy, when we work a case...

03:52.466 --> 03:54.946
...there's always that point...

03:55.902 --> 03:58.974
...when we have to face the truth. Right?

04:02.576 --> 04:04.112
Even if we don't like it.

04:05.779 --> 04:07.656
Well, truth is...

04:08.915 --> 04:10.326
...there's no way around this.

04:13.653 --> 04:18.159
We saw what happened to Cain.
Okay? I'm not happy about it.

04:19.125 --> 04:20.935
But I gotta move on.

04:24.664 --> 04:28.771
So I'm gonna keep doing what we do.
While I still can.

04:28.935 --> 04:31.313
And I'd like you to be there with me.

05:14.548 --> 05:16.152
Agents, I gather?

05:18.618 --> 05:21.394
Uh, was it the suits or do we give off
some son of Fed stench?

05:21.621 --> 05:23.157
Heh, no, no, it's the suits.

05:23.990 --> 05:25.367
What can I do for you boys?

05:25.625 --> 05:29.232
Well, uh, we're here investigating
the death of Private Jacki Prescott.

05:29.396 --> 05:31.569
Shoot. You drove all the way down
from D.C.?

05:31.731 --> 05:33.404
- Mm-hm.
- Yeah, we did.

05:33.633 --> 05:37.046
Well, then sorry to waste your time,
agents, but we wrapped that one up.

05:37.237 --> 05:41.913
The guy who did it
was a Special Forces officer, Rick Willis.

05:42.876 --> 05:44.412
What makes you sure it was him?

05:44.644 --> 05:48.353
His fingerprints were all over the storage
room out on the base where he did it.

05:48.548 --> 05:51.028
Even left his dog tags by the body.

05:51.218 --> 05:52.253
So is he in custody?

05:53.520 --> 05:57.525
Nope. Bastard drank a boatload of gasoline
and lit himself on fire.

05:59.259 --> 06:01.762
- Well, that's hell of a way to go.
- No kidding.

06:01.928 --> 06:03.771
Left a wife and a baby.

06:03.930 --> 06:06.274
Third suicide we've seen in six months.

06:06.433 --> 06:07.878
Military town.

06:10.437 --> 06:12.246
Would you like some cake?

06:12.405 --> 06:13.440
Mm.

06:13.607 --> 06:14.950
No. You know what? We're okay.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.449
No, it's really good. My partner made it.

06:17.711 --> 06:20.453
Looks great, but we're...
No, we're all right.

06:20.614 --> 06:22.958
Uh, we do have one more question.

06:23.183 --> 06:25.185
Were there any bite marks
found on the body?

06:26.052 --> 06:29.261
No. The vic was killed with a bowie.

06:30.423 --> 06:32.596
Well, sir, thank you for your time.

06:32.792 --> 06:34.066
Yeah, ahem.

06:35.295 --> 06:37.297
No bite marks.
There goes our rougarou.

06:37.530 --> 06:38.702
So, what, a God?

06:38.899 --> 06:42.472
I don't like the sound of that.
The guy Molotov cocktailed himself.

06:42.702 --> 06:45.979
That's bonkers.
That's like demon-possession bonkers.

06:50.310 --> 06:51.414
Rick did it.

06:52.245 --> 06:54.919
I'm not trying to say that he didn't.

06:55.315 --> 06:56.419
But...

06:57.150 --> 07:01.428
I mean, he just got back from deployment and
we've seen what it can do to a soldier's mind.

07:03.123 --> 07:04.158
My Rick...

07:05.492 --> 07:08.473
When he's home and good...

07:09.496 --> 07:11.999
...I have to kill the spiders, you know?

07:16.670 --> 07:19.344
Rick was a kind soul.

07:20.740 --> 07:22.686
He never took more life than he had to.

07:24.811 --> 07:28.953
Did you, um, notice anything strange?
Weird?

07:29.149 --> 07:31.652
Like, uh, violent mood swings?

07:31.851 --> 07:33.296
Or weird smells?

07:34.754 --> 07:36.256
No.

07:36.456 --> 07:37.992
But...

07:39.859 --> 07:42.339
Rick was... He was so...

07:42.529 --> 07:43.803
He was thirsty.

07:44.264 --> 07:45.299
Thirsty for what?

07:45.865 --> 07:46.969
Water.

07:47.701 --> 07:50.875
He'd spend half the day
drinking from the garden hose.

07:51.805 --> 07:56.481
And then one night, I caught him in the tub
drinking the bath water.

07:57.210 --> 08:00.282
When I told him to stop,
it was like he couldn't even hear me.

08:01.548 --> 08:04.392
And his skin, it got so dry, it bled.

08:05.151 --> 08:06.494
Did he see a doctor?

08:06.886 --> 08:11.494
I took him to the VA,
but he just got on a list to get on a list.

08:11.691 --> 08:14.171
And then he stopped talking.

08:14.394 --> 08:16.670
He just wasn't himself.

08:19.032 --> 08:22.411
I thought maybe it was PTSD.

08:28.241 --> 08:29.686
We're very sorry.

08:34.414 --> 08:38.089
You said that Rick was recently deployed.
Do you have any idea where?

08:39.818 --> 08:42.095
No, that stuff is classified.

08:42.322 --> 08:44.427
They don't even let the wives in on it.

08:45.091 --> 08:46.536
Right.

08:46.826 --> 08:48.772
Okay, we'll, uh...

08:49.262 --> 08:52.869
We'll leave you alone, but if something
comes up, anything, give us a call.

08:53.066 --> 08:54.374
There's one other thing.

08:55.402 --> 08:58.246
I ran into my friend Jemma
at the supermarket.

08:58.438 --> 09:02.045
She's married to Kit Verson,
a guy from Rick's team.

09:05.278 --> 09:08.623
She thinks Kit came back
different this time.

09:09.282 --> 09:11.785
Kind of felt like we were dealing
with the same thing.

09:14.087 --> 09:15.623
Thank you.

09:20.627 --> 09:23.972
Kit's been going through some stuff,
for sure.

09:24.130 --> 09:27.942
- Um, it takes him a while to get back to normal.
- Thanks.

09:28.134 --> 09:29.977
But he always does.

09:30.136 --> 09:32.639
And what about you.
How are you holding up'?

09:32.939 --> 09:34.646
I'm okay.

09:34.974 --> 09:36.282
For the most part.

09:36.476 --> 09:41.391
You know,
what happened to Rick and Beth, it...

09:41.581 --> 09:43.424
It's been hard.

09:46.486 --> 09:49.592
There but for the grace of God, you know?

09:54.828 --> 09:58.970
Um, may we speak with your husband?

10:00.100 --> 10:01.170
He, um...

10:02.102 --> 10:05.845
He went out last night,
but he should be back any minute.

10:06.005 --> 10:08.508
You know,
Kit comes back from these deployments...

10:08.675 --> 10:10.177
...and he needs his space.

10:10.410 --> 10:11.684
So he's been out all night?

10:12.779 --> 10:15.623
Well, yeah.

10:19.919 --> 10:21.626
Ah, oh, God.

10:21.821 --> 10:24.529
I can't even convince myself. Um...

10:25.325 --> 10:26.963
I'm worried.

10:27.160 --> 10:29.037
This isn't like him.

10:29.662 --> 10:30.970
Has he been thirsty?

10:31.531 --> 10:33.875
Like drink-out-of-the-dog-bowl thirsty?

10:35.835 --> 10:37.473
How did you know?

10:47.547 --> 10:48.719
Recognized your wheels.

10:50.850 --> 10:53.558
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Jemma called me in.

10:53.720 --> 10:57.896
I've known Kit since we were military brats
raising hell on the same base.

10:58.324 --> 10:59.394
He's a good man.

11:01.161 --> 11:02.572
No one's saying he's not.

11:02.729 --> 11:05.903
Oh, really, now? So, what are you two, uh,
here for? Jemma's sweet tea?

11:08.001 --> 11:09.981
You wanna tell me why you're really here?

11:10.170 --> 11:12.241
- We're working a case.
- Oh, Kit's case?

11:13.840 --> 11:17.583
Honestly, we're not sure just yet,
but, um, it's looking like it.

11:17.744 --> 11:19.985
Hmm, says you.

11:21.915 --> 11:24.191
There's a murder-suicide in town.

11:24.384 --> 11:29.094
Your buddy Kit? Same unit as the killer,
same whacked-out antics.

11:29.255 --> 11:30.734
So...

11:33.560 --> 11:35.540
Look, we're not going anywhere, all right?

11:35.728 --> 11:38.868
And if you care about your buddy,
you'll let us handle this.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.670
Hmm.

11:42.268 --> 11:44.714
No, I think I'm gonna be coming with you.

11:45.205 --> 11:46.275
Oh, the hell you are.

11:46.606 --> 11:49.109
- I got contacts. I can help.
- You really can't.

11:49.375 --> 11:52.015
For example,
friend of mine works military intelligence.

11:52.212 --> 11:53.885
Owes me a favor.

11:56.950 --> 11:58.793
Would he know Rick and Kit's mission?

11:59.018 --> 12:00.292
Sure.

12:00.553 --> 12:02.032
And he'd tell me all about it.

12:04.457 --> 12:06.300
- Okay, fine.
- No, it ain't.

12:08.294 --> 12:12.140
I figure what's going on here, I stick
to you two like flies on road kill...

12:12.398 --> 12:14.469
...make sure my buddy comes home
in one piece.

12:17.570 --> 12:21.313
Look, I know what you two are thinking,
but we are not gonna hunt my best friend.

12:21.541 --> 12:23.817
Who happens to be a frigging war hero,
by the way.

12:24.043 --> 12:26.250
We are gonna find him.

12:26.546 --> 12:27.820
And that's the difference.

12:28.081 --> 12:30.459
We're right there with you.
Kit's a hero, but...

12:30.650 --> 12:32.288
But you gotta prepare yourself.

12:32.485 --> 12:35.261
Kit might not be Kit anymore.

13:22.869 --> 13:24.371
Uh, sir?

13:24.871 --> 13:27.147
Sir, you have to pay for that first.

13:30.877 --> 13:32.151
Hey...

13:40.386 --> 13:42.229
Now, look what you ma...

13:51.164 --> 13:52.643
Hey...

14:09.248 --> 14:10.921
This guy just came in.

14:12.218 --> 14:13.891
You gotta hurry.

14:23.763 --> 14:26.266
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

14:28.034 --> 14:30.742
Yo. Sustenance.

14:30.937 --> 14:34.077
And I got nothing on cattle deaths,
freakish weather. None of it.

14:35.208 --> 14:37.779
So, uh, probably not a demon.

14:38.044 --> 14:39.955
Maybe it's not your kind of thing at all.

14:40.613 --> 14:43.253
Well, when in doubt, eat.

14:44.784 --> 14:45.888
Okay, here we go.

14:47.120 --> 14:50.294
I got an encrypted email here
from my friend at the Ml.

14:51.090 --> 14:53.400
- And?
- Well...

14:53.926 --> 14:57.897
Kit and Rick were sent to rescue an
American POW being held in Iraq.

14:58.064 --> 14:59.304
The Najaf cemetery.

15:00.066 --> 15:01.568
Cemetery?

15:03.436 --> 15:06.576
Bastards use them as a, uh, prison.

15:07.140 --> 15:08.915
I got some footage here, ah...

15:09.308 --> 15:12.812
...from the camera on Willie's helmet
during his last mission with Kit.

15:13.246 --> 15:14.725
Okay, go.

15:21.320 --> 15:22.663
Clear.

15:22.822 --> 15:23.994
Major Jones?

15:24.791 --> 15:25.826
Major Matt Jones.

15:28.594 --> 15:30.665
Hey, Major Jones, is that you?

15:30.830 --> 15:35.301
Hey. Hey, I'm Captain Kit Verson.
We're here to bring you home, man.

15:40.773 --> 15:42.446
What the hell?

15:42.942 --> 15:44.353
What the hell was that?

15:48.648 --> 15:51.788
- I'm guessing that didn't have a happy ending.
- No, it did not.

15:51.984 --> 15:53.861
Mission failed.

15:54.153 --> 15:56.030
And that POW got shot by guards.

15:57.523 --> 15:59.696
Really? That's what happened?

15:59.859 --> 16:02.362
Ah, that's the official story.

16:03.529 --> 16:06.009
Kit and Rick came back screwed up.
We know that much.

16:06.199 --> 16:08.839
Well, and then Rick jumped the high dive.

16:09.535 --> 16:11.037
God, Kit.

16:12.538 --> 16:13.846
What was that?

16:14.040 --> 16:16.884
I set my phone to get local alerts.

16:18.144 --> 16:20.886
- Is it bad?
- It's bloody.

16:23.349 --> 16:25.386
All right, let's get out of here.

16:35.194 --> 16:36.673
Licked the blood off the floor.

16:36.863 --> 16:39.309
Soda jockey back there
seemed pretty shook up by it.

16:39.499 --> 16:43.140
Now, the description he gave,
medium build, brown hair.

16:43.336 --> 16:44.974
That sound like the Kit you know?

16:45.238 --> 16:47.684
- Yeah, it does.
- Great.

16:47.840 --> 16:50.480
It still sound like it
ain't our kind of thing?

16:55.915 --> 16:57.417
- Hey, Jem.
- Cole.

16:57.650 --> 17:00.256
Uh, the news said someone was killed
at the Gas 'N Sip on Kenton.

17:00.419 --> 17:02.490
Yeah, I know. I'm here right now.

17:02.655 --> 17:05.693
You are? What are they saying?

17:05.892 --> 17:06.926
Not much.

17:07.159 --> 17:09.435
Look, I really can't talk right now,
I'm sorry...

17:09.662 --> 17:12.540
Wait. Do they think that he-I?

17:12.732 --> 17:14.405
That Kit, ah...

17:14.834 --> 17:15.868
...did this?

17:17.502 --> 17:18.573
I don't know.

17:20.205 --> 17:24.279
If he did, he isn't in his right mind.

17:24.510 --> 17:26.251
And you know that, Cole.

17:27.046 --> 17:29.117
- You got to save him.
- Ah.

17:29.782 --> 17:30.852
I will.

17:31.784 --> 17:32.854
I know.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.588
And, uh...

17:35.087 --> 17:37.294
That's the only thing
keeping me sane right now.

17:39.292 --> 17:42.603
I was thinking, you know,
sometimes when Kit wanted to be alone...

17:42.795 --> 17:45.742
...he would head up north,
to his dad's old cabin.

17:46.632 --> 17:50.045
Maybe you could go check it out
and I'll stay here in case he comes home.

17:51.070 --> 17:54.074
- Right.
- Hey, kung fu grip, you coming?

17:55.141 --> 17:56.211
Hey, Jem, I gotta go.

17:56.409 --> 18:00.755
- So what next?
- We hit every cop shop within a 10-mile radius.

18:00.947 --> 18:05.555
- Put the word out, see if we can track Kit down.
- And if you find him, what then?

18:09.121 --> 18:10.657
Kit needs help.

18:10.890 --> 18:13.996
He doesn't need a bullet,
and he doesn't need a knife.

18:16.495 --> 18:21.137
You know what, Cole,
we know you wanna protect your buddy.

18:21.334 --> 18:23.837
- But...
- If he's a monster...

18:25.004 --> 18:26.176
...we gotta put him down.

18:28.975 --> 18:31.353
That's the way it's gonna have to be, huh?

18:32.144 --> 18:33.680
That's the job.

18:37.917 --> 18:39.521
So you in or out?

18:54.033 --> 18:56.536
- Thanks for the lift.
- It's better this way, all right?

18:56.802 --> 19:00.306
- You keep her calm, we'll keep you posted.
- Yeah.

19:00.506 --> 19:02.213
And Cole?

19:02.808 --> 19:05.880
He shows up, don't try and be a hero.
Call us.

19:06.445 --> 19:07.719
You got it.

19:41.080 --> 19:43.185
And you bought him dinner.

20:08.774 --> 20:10.276
Kit?

20:24.423 --> 20:26.903
Hey, Kit, you here?

20:27.093 --> 20:28.128
It's Cole.

20:29.795 --> 20:32.639
There's some real serious people
looking for you, Kit.

20:32.798 --> 20:34.573
And they won't just wanna talk.

20:48.314 --> 20:50.487
It's bad, Kit.

21:01.127 --> 21:03.437
And it's either me...

21:04.096 --> 21:05.803
...or them.

21:17.176 --> 21:18.849
Hey, Kit?

21:19.145 --> 21:20.180
Hey.

21:20.980 --> 21:22.118
Hey, Kit.

21:22.314 --> 21:23.349
Oh, my God.

21:23.582 --> 21:26.358
I'm sorry. I can't stop.

21:49.842 --> 21:50.980
Wait, wait, wait.

22:03.722 --> 22:05.065
Oh, God.

22:17.636 --> 22:19.138
Oh, God.

22:21.540 --> 22:23.747
Something went down my throat.

22:24.076 --> 22:26.420
- All right, Cole, just try and stay calm.
- Oh, God.

22:26.645 --> 22:28.090
- Cole?
Something moved.

22:28.247 --> 22:31.091
- It's alive, Sammy.
- We're gonna get it out of you, okay?

22:31.250 --> 22:33.730
- How?
- We'll figure it out.

22:35.387 --> 22:39.028
Hey, that was a dumb-ass move
coming in here alone. You know that, right?

22:39.225 --> 22:42.263
Sorry, should've let the machete brothers
cut my buddy's head off.

22:42.428 --> 22:45.432
If you did, maybe you wouldn't be
choking down a damn Khan Worm.

22:45.598 --> 22:47.908
- What's a Khan Worm?
- You think that's what it is?

22:48.100 --> 22:51.274
- Or some sort of freak cousin.
- Freak cousin of what?

22:51.437 --> 22:53.439
Ah, couple years ago,
Dean and I worked a case.

22:53.606 --> 22:55.449
We got stuck in a cannery with this worm.

22:55.674 --> 22:57.085
- It'd get into people...
- Awful.

22:57.276 --> 23:00.257
All right, so you been to this
rodeo before. How do we kill it?

23:03.449 --> 23:05.292
Worst case?

23:05.451 --> 23:06.953
Headshot the person it's in.

23:07.186 --> 23:11.430
- Worm crawls out, we stomp it like a bug.
- Ls there a version where you don't cap me?

23:14.793 --> 23:17.967
Yeah. Uh, last time,
electrocution made the worm leave the body.

23:18.297 --> 23:20.573
All right, fine. Electrocution it is.

23:20.766 --> 23:21.801
I'm game.

23:26.071 --> 23:29.416
All right.
You two get to work, I'll go look for Kit.

23:29.608 --> 23:31.087
- Hey, hey, Sammy.
- Yeah?

23:31.277 --> 23:34.258
If we can fix me, we can save Kit, right?

23:35.247 --> 23:36.988
That's the idea.

23:43.656 --> 23:46.637
You know that this is gonna hurt
like a son of a bitch.

23:47.126 --> 23:52.974
Hell, I have a wife, a kid,
and an upside-down mortgage to get back to.

23:53.165 --> 23:55.304
Whatever it takes, Deano.

23:56.969 --> 23:58.471
Okay.

24:02.341 --> 24:06.118
So last time you saw this thing,
it turned people into killers too?

24:06.312 --> 24:09.759
Yeah, except that one
did a mind control number on us.

24:09.915 --> 24:12.452
Ah, damn.

24:13.652 --> 24:15.529
Day in, day out...

24:15.788 --> 24:19.964
...you and Sammy saving people from things
they just can't wrap their minds around.

24:20.159 --> 24:22.298
Hell, and nobody even notices it.

24:25.831 --> 24:28.175
Hell, at least I get a
medal for my efforts.

24:28.367 --> 24:31.041
But you? Heh.

24:31.203 --> 24:32.773
I tried to kill your ass.

24:34.173 --> 24:36.278
Yeah. Well, good times.

24:36.475 --> 24:38.819
I almost took you off the map.

24:39.678 --> 24:41.715
Who'd be saving me now?

24:42.982 --> 24:45.861
Yeah, well,
let's not get too sentimental about it.

24:46.552 --> 24:49.158
All right, let's fire this puppy up.

24:49.355 --> 24:52.029
Well, you say that
like it's just another Tuesday.

24:52.224 --> 24:55.501
Oh, buddy, it's only Monday.

25:25.090 --> 25:27.866
- Anything?
- Last time, it came out of our ears.

25:28.594 --> 25:30.232
And?

25:31.096 --> 25:32.939
I'm not seeing anything yet.

25:33.198 --> 25:34.609
Do it again.

25:48.047 --> 25:50.118
All right, that sucker
should've crawled out by now.

25:51.450 --> 25:52.622
Again.

25:52.785 --> 25:55.129
- I keep going, this is gonna kill you.
- Again.

26:18.644 --> 26:19.884
Cole.

26:20.079 --> 26:22.286
Hey. Hey.

26:22.748 --> 26:24.159
Cole.

26:24.583 --> 26:25.994
Come on.

26:27.653 --> 26:28.825
Cole.

26:35.060 --> 26:36.835
Hey! Hey. Okay.

26:44.136 --> 26:46.446
- Again.
- No.

26:46.638 --> 26:50.176
No, we're done playing Operation.
I zap you again, you're toast.

26:52.277 --> 26:53.654
Just take a knee.

27:09.695 --> 27:11.197
Dean. How'd it go?

27:11.463 --> 27:12.874
Worm was a no-show.

27:13.031 --> 27:16.035
- That doesn't make any sense. Last time...
- This ain't last time.

27:16.201 --> 27:19.341
Maybe this is a new species.
All I know is that Sparky struck out.

27:20.038 --> 27:23.679
Well, there's gotta be something.
I mean, everything has a weakness, right?

27:23.876 --> 27:25.355
Well, what about you, any luck?

27:25.811 --> 27:26.983
I'm on my way to Kit's.

27:27.179 --> 27:28.556
Thought I'd check there first.

27:28.714 --> 27:31.524
All right, well, hurry up, man.

27:31.850 --> 27:33.386
You got it.

27:37.022 --> 27:38.228
You Okay?

27:38.457 --> 27:41.336
So this is what "in over your head"
looks like.

27:42.694 --> 27:44.696
Just gotta keep your head in the game.

27:46.064 --> 27:48.704
Okay, what do we know about this thing?

27:49.067 --> 27:51.240
Uh, sucker dries you out.

27:53.572 --> 27:54.915
I'm thirsty already, man.

27:56.041 --> 27:57.679
It likes water.

27:57.876 --> 27:59.219
Then when that's not enough...

27:59.411 --> 28:00.913
Blood. I don't know.

28:01.079 --> 28:04.925
Maybe lack of fluids
makes the thing hostile.

28:05.083 --> 28:08.724
So it's like a parasite.
It wrings you dry, and then it moves on.

28:08.921 --> 28:12.698
So if I dry myself out, son of a bitch
wouldn't like that very much, would he?

28:12.891 --> 28:15.428
He'd want the hell out.
You'd be a hostile environment.

28:15.594 --> 28:17.369
Well, more than you already are.

28:17.863 --> 28:22.710
Well, to be fair,
you really haven't seen my chiller side.

28:24.570 --> 28:27.107
What do you think about rapid dehydration?

28:29.041 --> 28:30.076
Big fan.

28:32.411 --> 28:35.017
Just make sure you squash that sucker
when it goes AWOL.

28:35.547 --> 28:37.390
Sounds like a plan.

28:41.386 --> 28:43.127
All right.

28:43.388 --> 28:45.561
Nothing like a sweat lodge
in the woods, huh'?

29:13.652 --> 29:15.325
Kit?

29:20.993 --> 29:22.165
Honey.

29:23.262 --> 29:25.173
Look at me.

29:29.935 --> 29:31.608
What's happened to you?

29:35.607 --> 29:36.642
Listen.

29:38.677 --> 29:42.181
Whatever happened, whatever you...

29:43.348 --> 29:46.522
You did, we're gonna fix this.

29:47.185 --> 29:48.823
Okay?

29:49.354 --> 29:51.800
We're gonna get you well.

29:54.860 --> 29:56.533
Baby?

29:56.695 --> 29:58.697
Aah! Kit. Aah!

29:59.197 --> 30:03.976
- Kit, stop, please.
- I can't stop.

30:12.210 --> 30:14.053
Are you okay?

30:26.892 --> 30:29.031
You're in a sweat lodge?

30:29.394 --> 30:31.840
You're the one who said
everything's got a weakness.

30:32.030 --> 30:35.910
I figure I take a shvitz, kill a freak,
call that a good day.

30:36.368 --> 30:37.870
Yeah, if it works.

30:38.070 --> 30:40.050
Ah, well, you got a better idea?

30:40.238 --> 30:41.876
Yeah, I do, actually, Dean.

30:42.074 --> 30:44.179
We know how to end this.

30:46.378 --> 30:49.086
Yeah, plan B for bullet,
but we're not quite there yet.

30:49.514 --> 30:51.516
- So just hold tight.
- All right.

30:51.717 --> 30:53.526
How's the wife?

30:55.587 --> 30:58.397
She barely holding on. How's Cole?

31:00.258 --> 31:02.033
He's going strong.

31:02.594 --> 31:03.698
Good.

31:04.529 --> 31:09.103
But Dean, Kit is gonna come to,
and when I got here, it was bad.

31:09.267 --> 31:10.871
We're on the clock, I get it.

31:11.670 --> 31:13.081
Yeah.

31:19.244 --> 31:21.781
Just keep sweating, man.
You're doing great.

31:30.589 --> 31:32.068
Sorry.

31:34.192 --> 31:35.262
I don't understand.

31:35.460 --> 31:39.602
Well, on Kit's last mission,
on his deployment with Rick...

31:39.798 --> 31:41.971
...there was an incident.

31:42.200 --> 31:46.774
And something got inside Kit.

31:46.972 --> 31:50.112
Have you seen anything?

31:50.308 --> 31:53.152
I mean, I saw something, okay?

31:53.311 --> 31:55.257
But it was...

31:55.981 --> 31:57.119
It was a monster.

31:58.283 --> 32:01.992
It was a real, live, actual,
honest-to-God monster.

32:03.789 --> 32:04.961
And your husband?

32:09.494 --> 32:10.837
It changed him.

32:12.497 --> 32:13.999
What?

32:14.833 --> 32:16.437
Who are you?

32:42.861 --> 32:44.363
My dad.

32:44.529 --> 32:46.634
He got something inside him too, right?

32:50.368 --> 32:54.043
You think this is what he felt like
when he turned?

32:55.373 --> 32:56.875
Maybe.

32:57.642 --> 33:01.317
I mean, he was human
before he was a monster.

33:04.516 --> 33:06.189
I get it.

33:06.384 --> 33:08.557
Why you did it, Dean.

33:08.787 --> 33:11.290
My dad wasn't my dad anymore.

33:13.024 --> 33:14.867
And if I go down that same road...

33:16.895 --> 33:18.704
...I want you to do that to me too.

33:20.532 --> 33:22.307
That road?

33:23.068 --> 33:25.070
That means giving up.

33:26.037 --> 33:29.575
If you think that's where you're headed,
then you got it ass backwards.

33:30.242 --> 33:31.744
You're gonna fight.

33:31.910 --> 33:34.356
Harder than you ever have.

33:34.713 --> 33:35.748
You understand?

33:50.095 --> 33:51.836
Deano?

33:54.933 --> 33:57.072
Will you do me the honor of...

33:57.269 --> 33:59.078
...tying me to this chain'?

34:04.342 --> 34:05.787
Yeah.

34:28.766 --> 34:30.143
Aah!

34:30.368 --> 34:32.746
Come on,
we both know you're not gonna do it.

34:34.105 --> 34:36.244
You are gonna sweat this one through.

34:36.440 --> 34:37.976
I can't, Dean!

34:39.311 --> 34:40.380
Yes, you can.

34:40.545 --> 34:42.320
Listen to me. Yes, you can.

34:42.480 --> 34:44.152
Think about your family, hmm.

34:44.416 --> 34:46.657
Your wife, your kid.

34:47.085 --> 34:48.655
Do you hear me?

34:48.920 --> 34:51.422
I appreciate the talk, coach.

34:51.623 --> 34:54.467
But honestly, all I can think
about is slicing your wrist...

34:54.659 --> 34:57.299
...and drinking you like a fountain.

34:58.797 --> 35:00.834
I guess that makes me a monster, don't it?

35:09.174 --> 35:11.677
- So you're a hunter.
- Right.

35:11.910 --> 35:13.480
And...

35:14.279 --> 35:16.486
I'm sorry, this is gonna take me a minute.

35:16.681 --> 35:18.456
It's, uh...

35:19.284 --> 35:22.857
It's crazy, right? It sounds crazy, I know.

35:23.021 --> 35:24.295
But it's the truth.

35:27.792 --> 35:30.705
I don't care if he's...

35:30.929 --> 35:32.533
...what you say he is, okay?

35:32.797 --> 35:33.832
He's my husband.

35:34.032 --> 35:36.205
Jemma, he tried to kill you.

35:36.468 --> 35:40.439
Was that your husband when you looked
into his eyes'? Was that the Kit you know'?

35:40.872 --> 35:43.011
Look, Dean is working on it.

35:43.208 --> 35:45.381
Dean and Cole. We'll figure it out, okay?

35:45.543 --> 35:49.047
- Let me check in with them.
- Yeah, all right.

35:50.682 --> 35:52.889
Sam. Sam.

36:06.831 --> 36:08.208
Sam...

36:27.218 --> 36:28.856
Stay here.

37:09.461 --> 37:10.769
Come on, Sammy, pick up.

37:16.801 --> 37:18.303
Don't make me pull this trigger.

37:18.770 --> 37:20.044
I already did.

37:27.645 --> 37:28.817
Holy...

37:50.268 --> 37:51.611
You okay?

37:51.803 --> 37:53.180
Yeah.

37:53.438 --> 37:55.179
Thank God.

37:56.074 --> 37:57.849
Thank God.

38:02.847 --> 38:06.317
- Hey.
- Sammy, we did it.

38:06.518 --> 38:07.690
Cole's all right.

38:07.852 --> 38:10.298
Get Kit over here as soon as you can.

38:12.524 --> 38:14.197
It's too late.

38:43.555 --> 38:45.159
Hey, Cole?

38:48.293 --> 38:49.863
Listen, I, uh...

38:50.862 --> 38:52.864
For whatever it's worth...

38:54.065 --> 38:56.705
...I really wish it hadn't ended this way.

38:56.868 --> 38:59.246
Ah, yeah, me too, Sammy boy.

39:01.539 --> 39:04.042
I mean, Kit, he was gonna kill her, and...

39:04.242 --> 39:06.813
I know. Jemma told me everything.

39:09.547 --> 39:12.084
Soldier goes crazy, attacks his wife.

39:13.318 --> 39:14.763
She had to kill him.

39:14.986 --> 39:17.933
Or at least,
that's the story that she's gotta tell.

39:23.161 --> 39:25.107
I guess I've seen it all now.

39:25.396 --> 39:27.034
Some.

39:27.232 --> 39:28.870
Not all.

39:31.035 --> 39:33.777
I just wanna go home, see my family.

39:38.710 --> 39:42.089
Wanna thank you, Deano,
for keeping me standing.

39:43.681 --> 39:46.924
Well, all it took was a little blood,
sweat and, uh, more sweat.

39:50.054 --> 39:51.761
You take care of yourself, you hear?

39:53.191 --> 39:54.966
All right, I will.

39:56.194 --> 39:59.232
But I still hope
I don't see the two of you anymore.

40:00.465 --> 40:02.138
No offense.

40:03.067 --> 40:04.410
None taken.

40:25.089 --> 40:26.898
Don't blame yourself for Kit, man.

40:29.460 --> 40:32.805
I... I can't help it, Dean.
It feels crappy.

40:34.465 --> 40:35.500
I know it does.

40:39.470 --> 40:40.608
I tried.

40:40.805 --> 40:42.011
I did, I tried. I just...

40:44.742 --> 40:46.915
I couldn't save this one.

40:50.982 --> 40:55.761
You know, you can do everything right,
and even still, sometimes...

40:57.488 --> 40:58.933
...the guy still dies.
