00:08.119 --> 00:10.826
- Answer that for me, will you?
- You bet, Coach.

00:13.836 --> 00:18.547
Cheers.
Carla? Yeah. Carla, it's for you.

00:18.676 --> 00:21.382
- Sounds like trouble with the kids.
- l'm not here.

00:21.513 --> 00:27.055
- Carla.
- Give it to me. What is it?

00:28.898 --> 00:31.604
Seraphina's where?

00:31.735 --> 00:33.230
Well, cut her down.

00:34.823 --> 00:38.904
No, l don't care if it helps
the TV reception. Cut her down.

00:39.663 --> 00:44.243
And if l get home and you've flushed
the car keys again, you've had it.

00:44.377 --> 00:48.293
By the way, any more problems tonight
and you're adopted.

00:49.176 --> 00:55.216
Your real mother
is Doris Slobotkin, 555 8921 .

00:56.143 --> 00:57.472
Think that's gonna work?

00:57.604 --> 00:59.977
One-in-a-million chance
but l gotta take it.

01:01.000 --> 01:07.074

02:17.128 --> 02:20.379
- Hello, everyone.
- Hi, Diane.

02:23.178 --> 02:25.337
Sounds like you had
a pretty nice day off.

02:25.473 --> 02:28.890
Well, it was so nice l don't know
if l'm ready to talk about it yet.

02:29.645 --> 02:31.852
However, if you insist.

02:32.983 --> 02:36.519
l went out with David
from the Anthropology Department.

02:36.655 --> 02:38.695
He took me up to New Hampshire.

02:38.866 --> 02:41.702
We walked in the woods,
we communed with nature.

02:41.828 --> 02:44.581
We stayed in a little inn
where John Adams slept.

02:44.707 --> 02:47.662
Yeah, lots of guys
sign the register that way.

02:51.341 --> 02:53.916
Well,
now l know why l didn't wanna talk.

02:54.470 --> 02:56.464
l had a pretty nice day off myself.

02:56.598 --> 02:58.758
Taffy and l went sailing
up at Marble Head.

02:59.102 --> 03:01.428
Taffy?

03:01.563 --> 03:02.975
Sailing?

03:03.358 --> 03:04.437
You?

03:04.943 --> 03:06.354
You got a problem with that?

03:06.695 --> 03:12.154
No. lt's just thought your idea of
romance was brunch and a cockfight.

03:13.413 --> 03:14.956
l love sailing.

03:15.082 --> 03:18.701
After seeing <i>Ordinary People</i>,
l've tried to get my kids interested.

03:23.593 --> 03:26.002
- Afternoon everybody.
- Ho, Norm.

03:26.138 --> 03:27.598
How's life treating you?

03:27.724 --> 03:29.682
Like he caught in bed with his wife.

03:31.062 --> 03:33.138
- How about a beer?
- Yowza!

03:33.982 --> 03:35.857
l gonna bring some company in.

03:35.985 --> 03:38.524
- Who are you bringing in?
- My new superior.

03:39.490 --> 03:41.448
l gotta butter him up a little bit.

03:41.576 --> 03:44.531
Bring him in here for a drink,
catch some dinner upstairs.

03:44.663 --> 03:47.950
- Why not take him to your house?
- My wife lives there.

03:48.419 --> 03:49.664
Gotcha.

03:50.588 --> 03:53.341
One things, you guys,
you don't know me in here, OK?

03:53.634 --> 03:54.666
Why?

03:54.802 --> 03:57.175
l don't want him to think
l'm a bar fly.

03:57.306 --> 03:59.844
- Good.
- Don't call me Norm.

03:59.976 --> 04:01.055
Gotcha, Norm.

04:02.688 --> 04:06.983
Diane, would you get some singles
up at Melville's, please.

04:07.111 --> 04:08.570
Aye, aye, skipper.

04:11.366 --> 04:14.072
Coach, l'll be right back.
l'm gonna get some wine.

04:21.380 --> 04:23.005
- Pardon me.
- Hi.

04:23.132 --> 04:24.924
l'm looking for a Diane Chambers.

04:25.052 --> 04:27.211
You're in luck. We've got one.

04:27.346 --> 04:30.432
- l beg your pardon?
- l hope you only want one.

04:32.186 --> 04:36.268
Do you sense this conversation
is an exercise in futility?

04:36.400 --> 04:42.523
Thank you. My name is Ernie Pantusso
but you can call me Coach.

04:42.659 --> 04:44.818
- Rebecca Prout.
- Hi, Becky.

04:44.954 --> 04:47.624
Diane and l shared a suite
at Bennington.

04:47.749 --> 04:51.795
No kidding? Sam and l
shared a Chunky Bar in Cleveland.

04:53.048 --> 04:57.462
- Where is Diane Chambers?
- Upstairs. She'll be a minute.

04:57.596 --> 05:00.384
Well,
l'll just sit at a table and wait.

05:00.516 --> 05:01.928
Okey-dokey.

05:02.060 --> 05:04.634
- Thanks for your help.
- You're welcome. Any time.

05:18.165 --> 05:20.740
- Rebecca.
- Diane.

05:22.129 --> 05:25.333
What a wonderful coincidence.

05:25.467 --> 05:27.507
l never come into a place like this.

05:27.636 --> 05:30.722
l'm doing research for a paper...

05:31.642 --> 05:34.015
What the hell's going on here?

05:35.230 --> 05:36.725
A serving girl.

05:40.237 --> 05:43.322
Would you bring us a bottle of wine?

05:43.742 --> 05:45.901
Only if l can spit in it.

05:48.456 --> 05:51.458
lt's all right.
l know that you work here.

05:51.586 --> 05:55.751
- Alright, how did you find out?
- l called your mother.

05:55.883 --> 05:58.838
She took her head out of the oven
long enough to fill me in.

06:02.016 --> 06:04.057
God, l've missed you.

06:04.353 --> 06:07.640
l'll never forget
those long afternoons in the quad,

06:07.774 --> 06:11.227
drinking champagne, eating brioche
with strawberry preserves.

06:11.362 --> 06:14.448
Reading and talking Schopenhauer.

06:14.658 --> 06:17.447
Well, enough Schope-talk.

06:21.585 --> 06:24.540
That's the beauty
about being a mailman.

06:24.672 --> 06:28.256
l don't have to play smoochy-woochy
with my superiors the way you do.

06:28.385 --> 06:32.716
Cliff, believe me, it's worth it
for accounting. l love numbers.

06:32.850 --> 06:34.475
God help me, l love them.

06:36.104 --> 06:38.596
Me, l like the challenges.

06:38.733 --> 06:42.898
Dogs, vicious kids,
those hard-to-find mailboxes.

06:43.030 --> 06:45.107
You think accounting's boring?

06:45.242 --> 06:47.615
l miss one digit,
a company goes in the toilet.

06:49.539 --> 06:52.078
l'll tell you when it all makes
sense. Mother's Day.

06:52.209 --> 06:54.618
Delivering a card to some old hag.

06:55.756 --> 06:57.334
Watching her eyes mist up,...

06:58.176 --> 07:00.584
..kinda gets me
right behind the old ballpoint.

07:01.388 --> 07:04.426
You want to talk sentimental?
Take that same old crone.

07:04.559 --> 07:07.182
Save her a couple of hundred bucks
on the short form.

07:07.313 --> 07:09.390
Then l know
why the Big Guy put me here.

07:10.776 --> 07:15.321
l actually get paid to stand here
and listen to great conversation.

07:31.137 --> 07:34.175
Rebecca, there's something wrong.

07:34.308 --> 07:37.595
You could always see
through my faÃ§ade of gaiety.

07:40.274 --> 07:42.149
Elliot and l have parted.

07:43.362 --> 07:47.492
Rebecca, no. You and Elliot?

07:47.618 --> 07:49.991
You were together for ever.

07:50.121 --> 07:57.004
l know. lt all began when Elliot got
his doctorate in lchthyology.

07:57.131 --> 07:58.542
His eye began to wander.

07:58.674 --> 08:03.219
The first thing l knew, he'd taken up
with a student on a squid expedition.

08:05.767 --> 08:08.259
A doctorate changes a man.

08:08.396 --> 08:10.436
But there'll be others, right?

08:10.566 --> 08:12.855
ln the meantime,
you still have your work.

08:12.985 --> 08:14.778
You'd think so.

08:14.905 --> 08:17.942
l used to find enormous comfort
translating Russian poetry.

08:18.076 --> 08:20.449
- l know.
- But no more.

08:20.579 --> 08:22.869
Even when l went back
over my favourite,

08:22.999 --> 08:27.164
Karashnikov's <i>Another Christmas</i>
<i>of Agony</i>, it failed to soothe me.

08:28.131 --> 08:31.086
''Mischa the dog lies dead in the bog,

08:31.594 --> 08:34.133
The children cry over the carcass,

08:35.515 --> 08:38.969
The mist chokes my heart,
Covers the mourners,

08:39.104 --> 08:41.429
At least this year we eat.''

08:48.116 --> 08:50.787
lf that didn't pick you up,
l'm at a virtual loss.

08:51.788 --> 08:55.158
What l need is to blot out
Elliot's memory.

08:55.293 --> 08:57.203
That's exactly what you should do.

08:57.337 --> 08:59.663
l'm looking for a man.

09:00.967 --> 09:02.248
Pardon?

09:02.386 --> 09:04.842
Diane, l've been thinking about this
carefully.

09:04.973 --> 09:08.177
l think what l need is something
l've never had before.

09:08.310 --> 09:11.016
An evening
of unbridled bestial pleasure.

09:12.441 --> 09:15.147
l want to burn
at the stake of passion.

09:17.114 --> 09:21.944
Rebecca, you're very vulnerable now.
Please, don't do anything foolish.

09:22.079 --> 09:26.328
l've never done anything foolish
in my life and it's high time l did.

09:26.794 --> 09:30.330
The man l'm looking for
should be peasant stock.

09:31.050 --> 09:35.844
Tall, dark, strong, hairy arms.

09:36.807 --> 09:41.518
But most important, he should be
unintellectual. One-word sentences.

09:41.647 --> 09:43.807
- Do you know anyone like that?
- No.

09:46.988 --> 09:49.231
Diane, did you get the small bills?

09:49.658 --> 09:53.075
Yeah. Right. Excuse me. Here you go.

09:53.205 --> 09:56.372
l need a ten in silver.
Would you get it for more, please?

09:56.501 --> 09:59.123
OK, Coach. l'll be right back.

09:59.255 --> 10:01.581
You just sit very still,
sip your wine.

10:01.716 --> 10:02.997
Slowly.

10:17.279 --> 10:18.442
Damn.

10:27.960 --> 10:30.499
- Hi there.
- Hi there.

10:32.174 --> 10:33.752
Come here often?

10:35.554 --> 10:37.761
Just about every day. l work here.

10:39.809 --> 10:42.266
l couldn't help noticing your arms.

10:42.396 --> 10:44.224
Yeah,
l get a lot of comments on these.

10:44.357 --> 10:46.351
They go all the way down to my hands.

10:48.279 --> 10:50.736
- What's your name?
- Sam. Change.

10:50.866 --> 10:53.323
Why? l like myself this way.

10:57.083 --> 10:59.491
Sam. Two bourbons straight.

11:00.004 --> 11:03.456
Diane, it's him. l want him.

11:04.677 --> 11:07.382
Who?
The gay guy with the war wound?

11:11.185 --> 11:15.231
You can't fool me.
He's exactly what l'm looking for.

11:15.984 --> 11:18.654
You're not interested in him,
are you?

11:20.740 --> 11:23.148
No, of course not.

11:23.285 --> 11:25.955
Then l'm going for him
before l lose my nerve.

11:28.125 --> 11:31.460
Sam,
that woman is a dear friend of mine.

11:31.588 --> 11:34.424
She is going through
a very difficult period.

11:35.009 --> 11:38.593
So whatever she asks you,
please, just say ''no''.

11:39.056 --> 11:40.966
- What?
- ''No.''

11:41.101 --> 11:43.011
- Diane?
- Yes.

11:43.145 --> 11:45.435
Would you excuse us a moment?

11:45.565 --> 11:46.941
Fine.

11:53.117 --> 11:55.241
Would you object
to joining me in my hotel

11:55.370 --> 11:57.162
for an afternoon of animal passion?

11:59.918 --> 12:00.950
No.

12:07.845 --> 12:10.634
- What's your name?
- Does it matter?

12:10.766 --> 12:11.762
No.

12:31.127 --> 12:34.663
Diane, Sam's not back yet.

12:35.675 --> 12:37.170
So? Who cares?

12:37.302 --> 12:41.432
l would if he took off with my friend
for two hours.

12:41.558 --> 12:43.717
One hour.

12:43.853 --> 12:45.478
And 53 minutes.

12:46.523 --> 12:48.896
Sam always did like day games.

12:51.947 --> 12:54.735
What do you say?
This looks a nice place.

13:02.294 --> 13:04.252
What are you gonna have, strangers?

13:05.674 --> 13:07.667
Let me get this, Mr Stabell.

13:07.802 --> 13:10.009
l think l'll have a...

13:10.138 --> 13:11.716
Perrier.

13:13.434 --> 13:17.564
- Give me a beer.
- Wait a minute. A beer?

13:17.690 --> 13:20.264
That sounds a refreshing change.
l'll have a beer.

13:23.406 --> 13:25.981
Coach. Listen.

13:26.118 --> 13:29.073
- Hold me to one beer tonight.
- One at a time?

13:30.165 --> 13:31.993
For the whole night.

13:39.178 --> 13:40.127
Here we go.

13:42.182 --> 13:44.721
Two tankards of their finest ale.

13:51.528 --> 13:52.939
Let's talk.

13:53.489 --> 13:55.031
- Hey, Sammy.
- Hey.

13:56.451 --> 13:59.536
- Diane, Sam's here.
- So?

13:59.664 --> 14:02.203
l'm gonna be in my office back here.

14:05.338 --> 14:08.293
Well, hey...
Nothing going on here, huh?

14:09.260 --> 14:10.505
Dead.

14:11.805 --> 14:15.970
l think l'm gonna stretch my legs,
get a little exercise, fresh air.

14:20.025 --> 14:22.232
Gotta take it easy.

14:22.361 --> 14:25.280
l have no respect
for a man who can't control himself

14:25.407 --> 14:26.950
when it comes to drinking.

14:27.869 --> 14:29.280
Me neither.

14:31.540 --> 14:34.163
How could you do that
to that poor woman?

14:34.294 --> 14:35.326
Do what?

14:35.462 --> 14:37.705
Do what. Thank you, Mr Quickpants.

14:39.676 --> 14:44.838
Rebecca is a very vulnerable person,
coming off a shattered relationship.

14:44.975 --> 14:46.885
How could you go off with her?

14:47.520 --> 14:49.395
She said, ''Would you mind?''

14:49.898 --> 14:51.227
Would you mind.

14:51.359 --> 14:54.978
Those three words are all that
separate you from a rutting pig.

14:56.157 --> 14:57.782
That and my aftershave.

14:58.785 --> 15:01.741
How dare you try to be funny
when l hate you?

15:02.582 --> 15:05.834
Come on. What's the big deal?
We're all adults, aren't we?

15:06.254 --> 15:11.796
Yes. Contrary to your assumption,
l am not a prude.

15:12.596 --> 15:14.720
l have a healthy attitude toward...

15:15.391 --> 15:16.637
..you know.

15:19.397 --> 15:21.224
Answer me one question.

15:21.358 --> 15:23.565
Are you proud of what you did today?

15:23.778 --> 15:25.403
l don't kiss and tell.

15:27.408 --> 15:29.567
The pig develops scruples.

15:30.537 --> 15:34.999
Come on. Look, l'm just kidding
you. Nothing happened. Alright?

15:35.126 --> 15:38.876
- He compounds it by lying.
- No lie. l swear, nothing happened.

15:39.799 --> 15:41.840
You mean
Rebecca came to her senses?

15:42.178 --> 15:45.133
No. l stopped it.

15:48.561 --> 15:49.973
l get it.

15:50.105 --> 15:53.855
You got angry because she considered
you nothing but a stud service?

15:54.695 --> 15:56.189
No, l like that.

16:00.578 --> 16:03.330
The problem was
that l couldn't shut her up.

16:03.456 --> 16:05.616
No offence
but your friend is very boring.

16:05.751 --> 16:08.243
She's depressing
and she's long-winded.

16:08.380 --> 16:11.832
Those dismal Russian poems.
They don't even rhyme.

16:13.136 --> 16:16.589
After listening to two hours' worth
of frostbite and famine,

16:16.724 --> 16:19.133
l decided
to get my balalaikas out of there.

16:21.564 --> 16:22.940
You turned a woman down?

16:23.066 --> 16:27.860
Yeah. Here l am all primed
for a wonderful afternoon...

16:29.742 --> 16:31.652
You can't admit the truth, can you?

16:32.704 --> 16:34.994
What? What is the truth?

16:35.458 --> 16:39.920
Decency finally won out. You did
the right thing. You were noble.

16:40.048 --> 16:42.670
No. l was bored.

16:44.429 --> 16:47.597
Unconsciously, you were sensitive
to her suffering

16:47.725 --> 16:50.477
and you didn't want
to take advantage of that.

16:51.104 --> 16:53.098
- Think so?
- Yes.

16:53.441 --> 16:57.143
Sam Malone, you're a better man
than you're willing to admit.

16:58.448 --> 17:03.195
Maybe you're right. Maybe l am kinda
turning into a sensitive guy.

17:04.664 --> 17:06.622
Maybe l'll never
look at a woman again

17:06.751 --> 17:09.836
and see her as a mere sex object.

17:11.883 --> 17:13.959
No, scratch that thought.

17:16.638 --> 17:18.679
lt was my favourite audit.

17:21.229 --> 17:25.394
lt nearly cost my marriage,
but it was worth it.

17:27.404 --> 17:29.860
Gotta go for the gusto.

17:30.700 --> 17:34.152
l like your enthusiasm, Norm.
You're a workhorse.

17:34.997 --> 17:36.540
Clydesdale.

17:38.001 --> 17:42.546
You know,
l'm having one heck of a time.

17:42.674 --> 17:46.804
l don't usually do this,
but let's have another.

17:49.892 --> 17:52.467
- Coach, two more beers.
- Can't do it, Norm.

17:52.604 --> 17:56.556
- No. lt's OK now.
- Norm, l'm not letting you down.

17:56.693 --> 17:59.731
- You said one beer.
- All right.

17:59.864 --> 18:02.107
- One beer for my friend.
- That's different.

18:02.242 --> 18:03.868
He'll have a pitcher.

18:08.584 --> 18:09.747
Diane,

18:10.587 --> 18:13.542
l've come to say goodbye.
For ever.

18:14.384 --> 18:19.178
- Rebecca, what's wrong?
- l'm not attractive to men.

18:19.307 --> 18:20.256
What?

18:20.392 --> 18:23.643
First Elliot and now what's-his-name.

18:25.607 --> 18:27.352
Rebecca, l'm sorry.

18:27.819 --> 18:30.690
Do you have to believe
in God to be a nun?

18:34.077 --> 18:35.905
lt helps.

18:36.664 --> 18:38.456
What did Sam do to you?

18:38.583 --> 18:42.084
- Who's Sam?
- The bartender.

18:42.881 --> 18:45.669
Nothing. That's the problem.

18:46.970 --> 18:50.470
Diane, he found me repulsive.

18:51.226 --> 18:55.307
No, Rebecca.
This must be a misunderstanding.

18:55.440 --> 18:57.682
He climbed out the window.

19:02.324 --> 19:06.537
l'm going back there to talk to Sam.
He must know that he's hurt you.

19:10.919 --> 19:14.087
l originally wanted to be a dancer.

19:15.759 --> 19:17.717
You're a pig.

19:18.220 --> 19:20.297
l haven't moved.
How did l get back to pig?

19:20.432 --> 19:23.517
- You have ruined a human being.
- Who?

19:23.644 --> 19:25.104
Rebecca.

19:25.230 --> 19:28.647
- She's sitting out there right now.
- Mother Russia? l'm not here.

19:29.986 --> 19:34.401
Sam, she's crushed. l have never seen
this woman so depressed.

19:34.534 --> 19:36.574
Believe me,
l have seen her depressed.

19:36.704 --> 19:40.370
- l believe you.
- Well, you have to do something.

19:40.501 --> 19:44.037
She is seriously upset. lt's your
fault for the way you rejected her.

19:45.591 --> 19:48.462
- Wait, where are you going?
- l am going to bring her in.

19:49.263 --> 19:52.514
No. Come on, give me a minute
to build a window, or something.

19:53.351 --> 19:55.843
You're going
to restore her confidence.

19:55.980 --> 19:57.439
What am l gonna say?

19:57.565 --> 19:59.773
Just tell her
the reason you rejected her

19:59.902 --> 20:02.145
wasn't because you found her
unattractive.

20:02.280 --> 20:04.108
What was the reason?

20:05.034 --> 20:09.448
l don't know. Tell her
that you belong to someone else.

20:09.582 --> 20:13.711
That you lost your head for a moment,
that you're an uncaring worm.

20:16.633 --> 20:19.837
l was laughed at by the other boys,
Norm.

20:20.889 --> 20:23.807
Rebecca, may l speak to you in here
for a moment?

20:23.935 --> 20:27.435
But don't they always laugh
at the graceful fellows?

20:31.027 --> 20:32.226
Hello, Rebecca.

20:32.947 --> 20:35.023
Hello... Again.

20:36.243 --> 20:40.289
When l left the hotel, l may have
given you the wrong impression.

20:40.415 --> 20:42.409
You see,
l thought there was a fire.

20:45.088 --> 20:46.963
l'm sorry.

20:47.967 --> 20:51.420
Rebecca, l might not have
been totally fair with you.

20:51.555 --> 20:55.389
The reason l left was,
l'm kinda seeing another person.

20:57.104 --> 20:59.477
l was afraid
this was going to happen.

20:59.608 --> 21:02.147
You're making excuses
to spare my feelings.

21:02.278 --> 21:05.613
No. This is true.
l really am seeing somebody else.

21:05.741 --> 21:07.900
- Please.
- Rebecca.

21:08.036 --> 21:11.121
You are a very desirable woman.

21:11.249 --> 21:14.833
He does happen to be going
with somebody, that's all.

21:14.962 --> 21:17.002
- Me.
- You?

21:19.510 --> 21:25.135
We can tell it now. Yes. Today we had
a tiff right before you came in.

21:25.268 --> 21:30.394
And Sam used you to make me jealous
and then when push came to shove,

21:30.525 --> 21:35.521
he finally remembered what
a wonderful thing we have together.

21:35.657 --> 21:37.733
lsn't that right, sweetheart?

21:37.868 --> 21:41.321
Yeah. Sure. You bet ya.

21:45.170 --> 21:50.546
Yes, Sam and l are deeply
and passionately in love.

21:53.639 --> 21:57.223
l can't believe it. You two?

21:57.353 --> 22:00.805
lt's incredible.
l'd never have put you two together.

22:00.941 --> 22:05.403
Well, l know. lt does test
the limits of human logic.

22:07.742 --> 22:11.907
But, like you, l was growing
bored with bright, articulate men.

22:14.918 --> 22:16.294
- You were?
- Sure.

22:16.420 --> 22:19.043
l was looking for meat and potatoes.

22:19.174 --> 22:21.630
Sam here, the old side of beef,
really fit the bill.

22:23.805 --> 22:29.264
You know, l was getting kinda bored
with beautiful, sexy, sensuous women.

22:29.396 --> 22:31.224
l decided to go for pleasant.

22:35.863 --> 22:40.693
Believe it or not, l actually prefer
a man who's thick and ordinary.

22:43.207 --> 22:45.081
l guess l'm kind of old-fashioned.

22:45.209 --> 22:47.962
l like a woman
who does what her man tells her.

22:49.006 --> 22:52.626
Lookee there, my shoe's undone.
Will you get that for me, honey?

22:57.810 --> 22:59.186
What, darling?

22:59.312 --> 23:02.349
Would you tie
my shoesy-woosy for me?

23:06.113 --> 23:09.613
She loves doing
these little things for me.

23:11.286 --> 23:13.743
That's a little tight there, honey.

23:15.542 --> 23:18.793
- How's that, sweetheart?
- That's much better. Thank you.

23:21.133 --> 23:26.046
Well, all of a sudden,
l feel like l'm intruding.

23:26.724 --> 23:30.094
l can see that
there's such emotion in this room.

23:32.440 --> 23:34.517
Thank you for everything, Diane.

23:34.651 --> 23:38.187
Rebecca, thank you.
lt was wonderful to see you again.

23:38.323 --> 23:41.029
- l'll write you.
- Oh, good. Things'll work out.

23:48.837 --> 23:50.877
Let go of me.

23:51.049 --> 23:52.709
- You had the gall.
- Just get...

24:05.527 --> 24:09.360
That's the kind of passion
l was hoping l'd find.

24:10.033 --> 24:11.942
You'll find it, Rebecca.
