19:30.667 --> 19:32.166
you've already given us,
Mr. Fleet--

19:32.166 --> 19:34.083
Quinton, please.

19:34.083 --> 19:35.834
[Trevor] Well, you're
our primary benefactor,

19:35.834 --> 19:37.542
and you're the reason
we're able to help so many.

19:37.542 --> 19:38.792
Ten grand, up front?

19:38.792 --> 19:39.792
In cash?

19:39.792 --> 19:42.875
That would be great.

19:42.875 --> 19:45.959
I'll have my wife's assistant
wire you the money.

19:45.959 --> 19:46.875
You're welcome.

19:46.875 --> 19:50.166
Yeah, thanks.

19:50.166 --> 19:52.917
I feel like I know you
from somewhere.

19:53.834 --> 19:55.792
I get around.

19:55.792 --> 19:56.458
Oh.

20:01.667 --> 20:03.166
Hi.

20:03.166 --> 20:05.667
You the agent
for the church on 86th?

20:05.667 --> 20:07.500
I'm sorry.
I'm late for a showing.

20:07.500 --> 20:10.083
I own a-an apartment building
around the corner.

20:10.083 --> 20:12.750
Why haven't you been able
to get a decent tenant in there?

20:12.750 --> 20:14.792
We have someone lined up
to lease.

20:14.792 --> 20:15.834
A homeless shelter.
I heard.

20:15.834 --> 20:19.000
Churches are tough.
People are afraid they'll be

20:19.000 --> 20:20.750
haunted by ghosts
of sadistic nuns

20:20.750 --> 20:21.542
and abused altar boys.

20:21.542 --> 20:23.667
So reach out
to some businesses.

20:23.667 --> 20:24.417
I have,

20:24.417 --> 20:26.625
and that property's
a disaster.

20:26.625 --> 20:28.208
So fix it up.

20:28.208 --> 20:30.083
Uh, it's a-it's a big space
at a great price

20:30.083 --> 20:32.417
in an up-and-coming
neighborhood.

20:32.417 --> 20:34.375
Someone decent
is gonna want to buy it.

20:34.375 --> 20:36.417
It's impossible to heat,

20:36.417 --> 20:39.208
the whole exterior
needs renovation,

20:39.208 --> 20:41.458
there's no AC,
half the windows are broken,

20:41.458 --> 20:42.208
the plumbing is from the '50s,

20:42.208 --> 20:44.583
and it's now home, sweet home,

20:44.583 --> 20:45.625
to a small village
of drug addicts.

20:45.625 --> 20:49.166
You want a better class
of tenants in there?

20:49.166 --> 20:50.542
You go clean it up.

20:56.291 --> 20:57.667
- Hey. What's going on, man?
- Hi.

20:57.667 --> 20:58.875
There you go.

20:58.875 --> 20:59.875
Hey, man, sorry about the mess.

20:59.875 --> 21:01.834
Oh, no, it's no problem.
Don't worry about it.

21:01.834 --> 21:02.959
This is Cami, my fiancée.

21:02.959 --> 21:05.291
Hi, how you doing?

21:05.291 --> 21:07.083
Excuse the boob.

21:07.083 --> 21:09.500
I have a nursing cover
somewhere, but...

21:09.500 --> 21:10.083
too tired to get it.

21:10.083 --> 21:12.709
Ah, it's no problem.

21:12.709 --> 21:14.458
I've been around babies
and boobs a lot, so...

21:14.458 --> 21:15.834
Thanks for coming over, man.

21:15.834 --> 21:17.250
I don't know my ass
from my head.

21:17.250 --> 21:18.417
Ah, it's all good.
Um...but look, uh,

21:18.417 --> 21:20.083
the guy with the Lexus
and the goatee

21:20.083 --> 21:22.417
called about his Harley.

21:22.417 --> 21:24.417
Oh, shit.

21:24.417 --> 21:26.917
I never got a chance
to look at it.

21:26.917 --> 21:28.709
Look, uh, could you check
the, uh, tension belt

21:28.709 --> 21:30.834
and the fuel hose,
replace the brake pads?

21:30.834 --> 21:32.250
Yeah, yeah,
it's no problem, man.

21:32.250 --> 21:32.458
Cool.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.583
[both chuckle]

21:39.583 --> 21:40.875
You wanna hold him?

21:40.875 --> 21:41.458
Yeah.

21:41.458 --> 21:43.208
He's just about done.

21:43.208 --> 21:45.333
Just use the sanitizer.

21:45.333 --> 21:46.500
Yeah, of course.

21:46.500 --> 21:48.291
Okay.

21:48.291 --> 21:49.917
Mm-hmm. Oh, I know.

21:49.917 --> 21:52.208
You wanna say hi?

21:52.208 --> 21:56.125
Hey, gorgeous. I got you.

21:56.125 --> 21:57.458
I got you.

21:57.458 --> 21:57.834
- I got you.
- [baby cries]

21:57.834 --> 21:59.250
Man, hey!

21:59.250 --> 22:02.709
Wow, look at that tiny nose!

22:02.709 --> 22:03.875
- Huh?
- [Cami chuckles]

22:07.208 --> 22:07.917
Listen, I-I think
you need to get

22:07.917 --> 22:10.917
an interim sponsor.

22:10.917 --> 22:13.041
That's all right.
I'll wait.

22:13.041 --> 22:14.458
No, you-you won't.

22:14.458 --> 22:17.166
Look, if you lose your shit
at 2 a.m.

22:17.166 --> 22:20.375
and you need someone to talk to,
that guy can't be me.

22:20.375 --> 22:22.333
I mean, not for a while,
you know?

22:22.333 --> 22:23.667
[baby cries]

22:23.667 --> 22:24.667
Some of these guys
have been sober

22:24.667 --> 22:25.375
longer than me.

22:25.375 --> 22:28.542
All of them are superior humans.

22:28.542 --> 22:29.542
I warned them
you might be calling.

22:32.000 --> 22:32.667
Take it.

22:40.125 --> 22:42.458
Mr. Gallagher, a word.

22:42.458 --> 22:44.250
Liam failed his exam today.

22:44.250 --> 22:47.041
He only got two
out of ten questions correct.

22:47.041 --> 22:49.041
I didn't understand
the questions.

22:49.041 --> 22:50.875
What kind of questions
are we talking?

22:50.875 --> 22:52.667
Basic word association.

22:52.667 --> 22:54.709
"Jennifer blanked the glue

22:54.709 --> 22:56.083
and finished her project."

22:56.083 --> 22:57.667
The choices were "applied,"

22:57.667 --> 22:59.250
"kicked," or "sliced."

22:59.250 --> 23:01.875
Liam scribbled them out
and wrote "sniffed."

23:01.875 --> 23:04.375
Well, technically,
it works.

23:04.375 --> 23:05.875
What else you got?

23:05.875 --> 23:07.458
"The front door is to the foyer

23:07.458 --> 23:10.208
as the back door is to..."

23:10.208 --> 23:12.041
The choices were "sidewalk,"
"kitchen," "street."

23:12.041 --> 23:14.375
He wrote "penis."

23:14.375 --> 23:16.208
[laughs] How the hell
would he know

23:16.208 --> 23:17.959
what a foyer is?

23:17.959 --> 23:19.291
What are we,
the Rockefellers?

23:19.291 --> 23:20.875
These questions
are standardized

23:20.875 --> 23:21.458
across the private school
curriculum--

23:21.458 --> 23:23.291
To favor the students

23:23.291 --> 23:24.542
who understand
the references.

23:24.542 --> 23:25.542
This is cultural bias.

23:25.542 --> 23:27.333
You'll put his face
on your brochure,

23:27.333 --> 23:30.125
but you ignore
his background.

23:31.291 --> 23:33.250
I understand your concerns,
Mr. Gallagher--

23:33.250 --> 23:34.542
Great.

23:34.542 --> 23:36.041

24:15.000 --> 24:16.583
Listen.

24:16.583 --> 24:19.250
"Well, slap my ass

24:19.250 --> 24:22.041
"Well, sit on my face

24:23.625 --> 24:24.667
Who's Bernard?

24:24.667 --> 24:26.041
Your mounted deer head came.

24:26.041 --> 24:27.792
Oh!

24:27.792 --> 24:30.375
Oh, wow.

24:30.375 --> 24:32.458
Beautiful.

24:32.458 --> 24:35.750
His eyes...so soulful,

24:35.750 --> 24:38.000
like he's begging me
not to shoot him.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.792
I don't want that thing
in my house.

24:39.792 --> 24:41.125
No, no, no, no.
This is for

24:41.125 --> 24:42.125
Kentucky time at the bar,

24:42.125 --> 24:44.959
but I think I went overboard
with my background.

24:44.959 --> 24:47.792
It's less cowboy
and more hick.

24:47.792 --> 24:50.458
Or hillbilly. Bumpkin?
I have so much to learn.

24:50.458 --> 24:52.375
- Kev...
- Colored greens, for example.

24:52.375 --> 24:54.125
Are they multicolored
or just green?

24:54.125 --> 24:55.583
Or is the colored part
just, like, racism?

24:59.709 --> 25:02.875
I understand that you're
going through something,

25:02.875 --> 25:04.500
and I support you,

25:04.500 --> 25:06.083
but if this goes on
for longer than a week,

25:06.083 --> 25:07.667
I'ma slap the redneck
right off you.

25:07.667 --> 25:10.041
Whoa, what's got you
all bowed up?

25:10.041 --> 25:11.041
Still pissed off
from this morning.

25:11.041 --> 25:12.917
Found out you-know-who
is trying to cheat us

25:12.917 --> 25:13.750
out of our money by splitting

25:13.750 --> 25:15.917
the Alibi's earnings
down the middle.

25:15.917 --> 25:16.667
- What?
- Mm-hmm.

25:16.667 --> 25:19.000
She gets half,
she gives us half.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.375
Well, she does do a shit-ton
more for the bar than us.

25:21.375 --> 25:23.542
What gives her the right to make
those kinds of decisions?

25:23.542 --> 25:25.583
I told her we should each
get a third.

25:25.583 --> 25:27.166
V, you gotta get over it.

25:27.166 --> 25:28.625
She never apologized
for what she did to us,

25:28.625 --> 25:30.959
- not once.
- V, this isn't healthy.

25:30.959 --> 25:32.875
You're madder than a hornet
in a Coke can.

25:36.333 --> 25:39.125
[quietly] Yeah, Coke can.

25:39.125 --> 25:41.041
I seriously cannot stop.

25:41.041 --> 25:41.750
[Ian] Yeah, and that look
he gave me

25:41.750 --> 25:44.208
when I said he was familiar.

25:44.208 --> 25:45.875
Yeah, it was kind of skeevy.

25:48.458 --> 25:50.542
Oh, holy shit.

25:50.542 --> 25:51.417
What?

25:51.417 --> 25:54.041
Ah, The Fairy Tail.
He's the guy

25:54.041 --> 25:56.041
who always asks for blow jobs
in the handicapped stall

25:56.041 --> 25:57.834
'cause he grabs the railing
for support.

25:57.834 --> 25:59.500
- No!
- Yeah. I didn't recognize him,

25:59.500 --> 26:00.959
'cause he always pulls
his turtleneck

26:00.959 --> 26:02.333
up over his face
when he comes.

26:02.333 --> 26:03.709
- Oh.
- Yeah.

26:03.709 --> 26:05.125
Wow.
Well, maybe that's why

26:05.125 --> 26:05.834
he was so quick
to give us the cash.

26:05.834 --> 26:07.709
I should've asked for more.

26:07.709 --> 26:11.000
- Mm.
- [spray can hissing]

26:11.000 --> 26:12.542
Yo.

26:12.542 --> 26:14.041
What're you doing?

26:14.041 --> 26:15.500
Fiona's paying me
to make the gang tags

26:15.500 --> 26:17.208
seem more artistic.

26:17.208 --> 26:18.500
Says that it's gonna
raise the profile of the hood.

26:18.500 --> 26:21.458
Oh, holy fuck,
what is that smell?

26:21.458 --> 26:23.709
It's like rotten,
rancid eggs.

26:23.709 --> 26:25.875
Grease trap.
No time to shower.

26:25.875 --> 26:27.750
All right.

26:27.750 --> 26:30.458
[Trevor] Hey, this place
could definitely work.

26:30.458 --> 26:33.542
I'll call the realtor tomorrow.

26:33.542 --> 26:34.125
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

26:34.125 --> 26:35.333
[Fiona] Hey!

26:35.333 --> 26:38.333
Yo, cleaning up
the joint?

26:38.333 --> 26:40.417
Yeah. Got the last
of the needles.

26:40.417 --> 26:42.250
Now folks can walk around
without contracting hepatitis.

26:42.250 --> 26:45.458
Oh, sweet.

26:46.667 --> 26:48.542
You, uh--
do you want to grab a bite?

26:48.542 --> 26:51.667
I'm craving some
teriyaki beef.

26:51.667 --> 26:53.583
Yeah, sure. I'm starving.
