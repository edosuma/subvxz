WEBVTT

00:01.068 --> 00:07.655
reads words on screen

00:19.517 --> 00:21.482
You're sure about
going back to school?

00:21.586 --> 00:22.862
It's only a couple
of days a week.

00:22.965 --> 00:23.965
It won't be too
much travel.

00:24.068 --> 00:25.379
Most of it I can
do from here.

00:25.482 --> 00:26.344
Ah.

00:27.482 --> 00:28.068
Nerd!

00:28.172 --> 00:29.068
Stop.

00:29.172 --> 00:30.413
You love it!

00:30.517 --> 00:32.172
<i>I've seen you reading journal
articles over my shoulder.</i>

00:32.275 --> 00:33.551
<i>Yeah, it's a
little charming.</i>

00:35.206 --> 00:36.448
<i>All right,
thanks for lunch.</i>

00:36.551 --> 00:38.827
Got to go see
my insurance agent

00:38.931 --> 00:42.137
before she takes me for dead and
cancels my insurance policy.

00:42.241 --> 00:44.379
<i>You sure you haven't
put it off long enough?</i>

00:44.482 --> 00:46.862
<i>Name one thing that's
more boring than insurance.</i>

00:48.620 --> 00:49.724
Why are you
locking up your gun?

00:49.827 --> 00:52.206
Guns make her a
little nervous.

00:52.310 --> 00:54.689
She had an accident when
she was a kid in her family.

00:54.793 --> 00:55.344
So-

00:55.448 --> 00:56.137
Oh.

00:56.241 --> 00:57.103
<i>I just
take it off.</i>

00:57.206 --> 00:58.310
You're considerate.

00:58.413 --> 00:59.482
<i>Yeah I really am.</i>

01:00.724 --> 01:02.241
Okay I'll see you
back at the station.

01:02.344 --> 01:02.931
See you.

01:03.034 --> 01:04.000
Oh, hey!

01:04.103 --> 01:04.655
Yeah.

01:04.758 --> 01:06.172
Um-

01:06.275 --> 01:07.586
I've been
putting it off.

01:07.689 --> 01:09.310
But um-

01:09.413 --> 01:12.551
my family's hoping I'll make
it home for my dad's birthday.

01:12.655 --> 01:13.655
Okay.

01:13.758 --> 01:14.965
Do you think you and
Rex would like to come-

01:15.068 --> 01:17.586
<i>in two weeks?</i>

01:17.689 --> 01:19.206
My mother's already invited
all the aunts and uncles.

01:19.310 --> 01:20.862
I think she wants
to show you off.

01:20.965 --> 01:22.000
Um-

01:22.103 --> 01:23.206
<i>I was going to buy the
tickets today, actually.</i>

01:23.310 --> 01:25.034
Just let me
check my calendar.

01:26.068 --> 01:26.689
Okay!

01:26.793 --> 01:27.965
<i>Um-</i>

01:28.068 --> 01:28.620
Yeah!

01:28.724 --> 01:30.379
Uh, yeah, let me-

01:30.482 --> 01:32.103
know what you decide!

01:33.103 --> 01:34.137
Okay!

01:34.241 --> 01:34.965
Come on pal.

01:44.965 --> 01:45.724
Don't worry, pal.

01:45.827 --> 01:47.206
It'll be fine.

01:48.896 --> 01:50.517
<i>Don't look like that.</i>

01:50.620 --> 01:53.241
<i>No one ever asked you
to meet the family.</i>

02:04.517 --> 02:05.241
<i>Hey Denise.</i>

02:05.344 --> 02:06.586
I'm just here
to see Nina.

02:06.689 --> 02:08.379
Detective Hudson!

02:08.482 --> 02:10.379
No dogs allowed, as
I've mentioned before.

02:10.482 --> 02:11.620
Yeah, um-

02:11.724 --> 02:13.482
Some of our customers
have allergies.

02:13.586 --> 02:15.344
And this one's
clearly a shedder.

02:17.413 --> 02:19.413
Could he stay out here with
you and keep you company?

02:19.517 --> 02:21.068
<i>I won't be long.</i>

02:25.103 --> 02:25.689
Fine.

02:25.793 --> 02:27.103
He can stay
with me.

02:27.206 --> 02:28.586
Ah, you're the best.

02:28.689 --> 02:29.655
<i>Hey Denise.</i>

02:29.758 --> 02:30.620
<i>Back from lunch already?</i>

02:30.724 --> 02:31.758
<i>Yeah!</i>

02:31.862 --> 02:32.931
These boxes aren't
going to move themselves.

02:34.206 --> 02:34.862
Okay.

02:35.793 --> 02:36.689
<i>You be good.</i>

02:47.827 --> 02:49.068
I said be good.

03:08.655 --> 03:09.896
<i>After you.</i>

03:13.103 --> 03:13.655
Hey Nina.

03:13.758 --> 03:15.103
Charlie!

03:15.206 --> 03:16.827
I thought I'd
never see you!

03:16.931 --> 03:17.896
<i>Yeah, sorry about that.</i>

03:18.000 --> 03:20.517
There's those papers
you asked for.

03:20.620 --> 03:23.103
I noticed
all the boxes.

03:23.206 --> 03:23.758
You all moving?

03:23.862 --> 03:25.344
It's our
last day here.

03:25.448 --> 03:27.344
The new office is
up on Merrymeeting.

03:27.448 --> 03:28.379
<i>But you'll
get an email.</i>

03:28.482 --> 03:29.068
Ah, too bad.

03:29.172 --> 03:29.758
I love the view.

03:29.862 --> 03:30.793
<i>Yeah.</i>

03:30.896 --> 03:32.379
<i>There's been some downsizing.</i>

03:32.482 --> 03:33.758
<i>Oh you're not
going anywhere?</i>

03:33.862 --> 03:35.172
Oh I'd never abandon
you, Charlie.

03:36.206 --> 03:38.793
<i>Um- let me just
pull up your file.</i>

03:38.896 --> 03:40.758
And I'll have you
out of here in a jiff!

03:40.862 --> 03:42.413
Okay.

03:42.517 --> 03:43.206
Something's not working.

03:44.586 --> 03:46.931
Felicia, did they disconnect
the phones already?

03:47.034 --> 03:48.689
No, not until the
end of the week.

03:49.620 --> 03:51.137
No peeking, Nina.

03:51.241 --> 03:53.206
I didn't see a
thing, Felicia.

03:56.827 --> 03:58.965
Did that look like
chocolate to you, or-?

03:59.068 --> 04:01.310
In my expert
opinion, no.

04:08.931 --> 04:10.344
There's some areas
we can improve.

04:10.448 --> 04:11.275
<i>Okay, that's great.</i>

04:11.379 --> 04:12.551
<i>So just a signature
right here?</i>

04:21.482 --> 04:22.103
<i>Rex no!</i>

04:24.862 --> 04:26.448
<i>Oh, you're lucky
you're not in my way!</i>

04:26.551 --> 04:27.379
<i>You stay down okay?</i>

04:28.172 --> 04:29.206
Okay!

04:49.793 --> 04:50.689
<i>Get down!</i>

04:55.655 --> 04:58.793
<i>Good afternoon,
Bay Insurance!</i>

04:58.896 --> 05:00.551
<i>Now I want everyone
out where I can see them!</i>

05:00.655 --> 05:02.137
<i>Right now!</i>

05:12.241 --> 05:13.206
<i>Ah come on!</i>

05:13.310 --> 05:14.103
<i>Don't make this difficult
on yourselves!</i>

05:14.862 --> 05:15.517
<i>Anybody in here?</i>

05:17.137 --> 05:18.172
<i>Hello!</i>

05:19.482 --> 05:20.310
<i>All right!</i>

05:21.068 --> 05:22.655
<i>We'll see how
long you can
hide!</i>

05:24.137 --> 05:25.103
<i>What?</i>

05:25.206 --> 05:26.586
<i>Everybody take the
day off or something?</i>

05:26.689 --> 05:27.275
Charlie [whispering]: <i>Nina!</i>

05:27.379 --> 05:28.448
<i>This way!</i>

05:33.413 --> 05:34.586
<i>Okay people!</i>

05:34.896 --> 05:36.517
<i>Just come
on out okay?</i>

05:36.620 --> 05:37.896
<i>Join the fun!</i>

05:42.172 --> 05:43.137
Shhhhh.

05:43.241 --> 05:44.758
<i>I mean it's
not a party-</i>

05:45.517 --> 05:46.827
<i>until everyone
joins the fun!</i>

05:47.275 --> 05:48.724
<i>This won't take long!</i>

05:48.827 --> 05:49.965
<i>I promise!</i>

05:50.068 --> 05:52.034
<i>Quick and easy!</i>

06:01.275 --> 06:02.482
You're bleeding.

06:02.586 --> 06:03.517
I've been shot.

06:03.620 --> 06:04.931
Nina!

06:05.034 --> 06:05.724
Are you all right?

06:05.827 --> 06:06.413
<i>What's happened?</i>

06:06.517 --> 06:07.137
Stay where you are.

06:07.241 --> 06:08.482
She's going
to be fine.

06:09.103 --> 06:10.620
<i>It's not too deep.</i>

06:10.724 --> 06:14.275
<i>Keep pressure on that.</i>

06:14.379 --> 06:15.206
<i>You're going
to be okay.</i>

06:15.310 --> 06:17.206
<i>This will stop
the bleeding.</i>

06:17.310 --> 06:18.137
Are we going
to die?

06:20.103 --> 06:21.517
No no.

06:21.620 --> 06:23.034
We're going to get
you out of here.

06:23.137 --> 06:24.068
<i>Okay?</i>

06:25.068 --> 06:26.586
Mm-hmm.

06:26.896 --> 06:28.241
<i>This ain't even a big
office!</i>

06:28.344 --> 06:30.310
<i>Where do you
think you can hide?</i>

06:54.793 --> 06:55.551
<i>Okay!</i>

06:55.655 --> 06:56.724
<i>Okay!</i>

07:06.068 --> 07:06.827
Keep the
pressure on it.

07:06.931 --> 07:08.034
Okay.

07:08.137 --> 07:09.206
<i>It's not
going to be pretty-</i>

07:09.310 --> 07:10.379
<i>if I have to find
you myself!</i>

07:10.482 --> 07:11.482
<i>I guarantee it!</i>

07:11.586 --> 07:13.241
<i>He's looking
for somebody.</i>

07:13.344 --> 07:15.068
There's another exit at
the back of the office.

07:15.172 --> 07:15.862
Is that one open?

07:16.310 --> 07:17.724
Only during
office hours, yeah.

07:17.827 --> 07:18.655
Okay.

07:18.758 --> 07:19.793
Who's your
friend next door?

07:19.896 --> 07:21.172
This is Wyatt.

07:21.275 --> 07:22.793
Wyatt!

07:22.896 --> 07:23.896
We're going to
make a move.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.379
<i>I'm going to need
you in a few minutes.</i>

07:25.482 --> 07:26.068
Are you sure?

07:26.172 --> 07:26.724
<i>Yeah.</i>

07:26.827 --> 07:27.551
This is Charlie.

07:27.655 --> 07:28.931
He's a detective.

07:29.034 --> 07:29.827
We can trust him.

07:32.103 --> 07:33.413
Okay.

07:34.172 --> 07:36.689
Okay,
okay, okay.

07:36.793 --> 07:38.034
<i>It's not working!</i>

07:40.206 --> 07:40.862
<i>Okay!</i>

07:44.827 --> 07:45.758
<i>He's
looking for someone.</i>

07:45.862 --> 07:46.896
<i>The second door
on the left.</i>

07:47.655 --> 07:49.206
Is there anyone
in that room?

07:49.310 --> 07:50.068
That's the bathroom.

07:51.310 --> 07:51.931
There's no dial tone.

07:52.034 --> 07:53.965
<i>Let's go!</i>

07:54.068 --> 07:55.344
He might have
disconnected the phones.

07:55.448 --> 07:56.482
<i>Come out, come out!</i>

07:56.586 --> 07:58.068
<i>Wherever you are!</i>

07:58.517 --> 07:59.793
There's no signal.

07:59.896 --> 08:01.448
<i>Well, our friend
came prepared.</i>

08:02.482 --> 08:03.482
He's got a cell
phone jammer.

08:04.310 --> 08:04.931
Don't worry.

08:05.034 --> 08:05.724
Other people
in the building

08:05.827 --> 08:06.586
must have
heard those shots.

08:22.724 --> 08:24.275
<i>This is the police!</i>

08:24.379 --> 08:26.931
<i>We are asking everyone
to exit the building-</i>

08:27.034 --> 08:28.689
<i>as quickly and as
safely as possible!</i>

08:28.793 --> 08:29.793
<i>Move directly-</i>

08:29.896 --> 08:31.586
<i>behind the police line!</i>

08:31.689 --> 08:33.000
<i>Do not stop
on the stairs!</i>

08:33.103 --> 08:33.827
Help's on the way.

08:34.206 --> 08:34.931
<i>Wyatt?</i>

08:36.172 --> 08:37.793
As soon as he gets into
one of those offices-

08:37.896 --> 08:38.482
<i>I'll call you.</i>

08:38.586 --> 08:39.724
Don't move before then.

08:39.827 --> 08:40.862
<i>I haven't
got all day guys!</i>

08:41.275 --> 08:42.482
<i>And you've got
even less than that-</i>

08:44.241 --> 08:46.655
<i>if you don't
come out now!</i>

08:52.000 --> 08:53.172
<i>Continue moving-</i>

08:53.275 --> 08:55.172
<i>until you are
behind police lines</i>!

08:56.068 --> 08:56.655
<i>Do not stop!</i>

08:56.758 --> 08:58.689
<i>Continue moving-</i>

08:58.793 --> 09:01.310
<i>until you are
behind police lines!</i>

09:03.034 --> 09:04.586
<i>Excuse me, I'm Sarah
Truong with Major Crimes.</i>

09:04.689 --> 09:05.310
<i>That's Rex.</i>

09:05.413 --> 09:06.034
<i>Yes, thank you.</i>

09:08.206 --> 09:09.103
What is happening?

09:09.206 --> 09:10.137
<i>A man
with a gun.</i>

09:10.241 --> 09:11.655
He went into our offices
and locked the door.

09:11.758 --> 09:12.310
Which offices?

09:12.413 --> 09:13.586
Bay Insurance.

09:14.448 --> 09:15.103
Oh.

09:18.620 --> 09:19.517
Did you see
Detective Hudson?

09:19.620 --> 09:20.206
Charlie Hudson?

09:20.310 --> 09:20.965
He's inside.

09:22.793 --> 09:24.172
<i>Maybe you're hiding</i>

09:24.275 --> 09:25.586
<i>in here!</i>

09:27.206 --> 09:28.241
Okay.

09:28.344 --> 09:29.413
He's gone into
one of the offices.

09:29.517 --> 09:30.241
Wyatt, come on!

09:30.344 --> 09:31.689
<i>Time to move.</i>

09:32.482 --> 09:33.758
<i>It's going to
hurt a little bit.</i>

09:34.517 --> 09:35.758
<i>Easy.</i>

09:39.586 --> 09:42.724
<i>If you have not already
left the building, remai-</i>

09:42.827 --> 09:43.655
<i>Come on!</i>

09:53.344 --> 09:55.896
<i>I'm getting
warmer, I just know it!</i>

09:56.000 --> 09:57.310
<i>Not many places
left for you to hide!</i>

09:57.413 --> 09:58.862
<i>Go to the left.</i>

10:17.931 --> 10:18.724
Damn it.

10:19.448 --> 10:20.448
<i>I've
got all day!</i>

10:20.551 --> 10:23.551
<i>I can look through
every single room!</i>

10:23.655 --> 10:25.068
<i>Oh just try me!</i>

10:27.620 --> 10:28.655
The door's locked.

10:28.758 --> 10:29.689
<i>No!</i>

10:29.793 --> 10:30.896
<i>Okay, what do
we do now?</i>

10:31.000 --> 10:32.413
<i>I'm starting
to get really mad now!</i>

10:32.517 --> 10:33.103
Howie.

10:33.206 --> 10:33.758
Charlie.

10:33.862 --> 10:34.448
Hi.

10:34.551 --> 10:35.137
Hi.

10:35.241 --> 10:36.068
<i>Where are you?</i>

10:47.586 --> 10:48.965
<i>Police are on the way!</i>

10:50.551 --> 10:51.827
Sarah.

10:51.931 --> 10:53.517
The shooter entered
an insurance office-

10:53.620 --> 10:54.551
<i>according a witness
who got out.</i>

10:54.655 --> 10:55.862
How did you
get here so fast?

10:55.965 --> 10:57.862
I was here with Charlie and
Rex just before they went in.

10:57.965 --> 10:58.965
Wait, hold
on a second.

10:59.068 --> 10:59.862
They're inside?

10:59.965 --> 11:01.655
Yeah, Charlie-
he's in there, Joe.

11:02.586 --> 11:04.551
<i>Damn it!</i>

11:06.000 --> 11:06.413
<i>That barking
is driving me crazy!</i>

11:06.517 --> 11:07.172
<i>I can't focus!</i>

11:11.689 --> 11:12.482
First things first.

11:12.586 --> 11:13.689
We've got to
take care of this.

11:13.793 --> 11:15.068
Wyatt, you know
how to do a tourniquet?

11:15.172 --> 11:16.724
Yeah-the door must be
blocked from the inside.

11:16.827 --> 11:19.000
We normally keep it open
during business hours.

11:19.103 --> 11:20.103
So phones and exits.

11:20.206 --> 11:22.724
He knows the layout
and he's got a plan.

11:23.068 --> 11:24.206
I've got
kids at home.

11:24.310 --> 11:25.344
<i>Uh uh uh uh.</i>

11:25.448 --> 11:28.206
Ahhhh- ah ah ah ah.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.275
I've got an idea.

11:38.172 --> 11:39.137
Quickly please!

11:39.241 --> 11:41.103
How many people are
inside that office?

11:41.206 --> 11:42.103
<i>Five, six?</i>

11:42.206 --> 11:43.034
I'm not sure exactly.

11:43.137 --> 11:44.034
Do you
have any idea-

11:44.137 --> 11:45.206
why he would have
targeted your business?

11:45.310 --> 11:47.689
Yeah, any disgruntled
customers lately, or-?

11:47.793 --> 11:48.827
Or staff having
problems at home?

11:48.931 --> 11:50.172
No, nothing like that.

11:50.275 --> 11:51.482
Not that
I know of.

11:52.827 --> 11:54.551
A few people did
get laid off recently.

11:54.655 --> 11:56.206
The company is downsizing.

11:56.310 --> 11:57.103
Okay listen to me.

11:57.206 --> 11:58.310
I want you to
write down the names

11:58.413 --> 11:59.689
of every single person
who was laid off.

11:59.793 --> 12:00.379
Okay.

12:00.482 --> 12:01.172
Do you understand?

12:01.275 --> 12:02.206
Put it right there.

12:02.862 --> 12:04.137
Excuse me.

12:06.448 --> 12:09.413
<i>Please move back!</i>

12:09.517 --> 12:11.586
<i>We're asking everyone
to move back-</i>

12:11.689 --> 12:13.137
<i>behind the police vehicles!</i>

12:14.965 --> 12:16.862
Charlie's not
answering his phone.

12:16.965 --> 12:18.068
There was something
wrong with the phones.

12:18.172 --> 12:18.896
I couldn't call out.

12:20.103 --> 12:23.103
Yeah but he should still
have his cell phone.

12:25.344 --> 12:26.413
Nice and tight.

12:26.517 --> 12:27.551
Gotcha.

12:27.965 --> 12:28.655
Be ready.

12:32.413 --> 12:33.206
Just breathe.

12:34.137 --> 12:35.137
Deep breath.

12:58.827 --> 12:59.482
<i>Hey!</i>

13:03.241 --> 13:04.034
<i>Hey!</i>

13:07.793 --> 13:09.068
<i>You go man!</i>

13:10.896 --> 13:11.827
<i>Oh I see!</i>

13:12.379 --> 13:13.034
<i>Hey!</i>

13:18.931 --> 13:19.758
<i>Aghh!</i>

13:19.862 --> 13:20.655
<i>It's not going
to hold.</i>

13:22.793 --> 13:23.448
<i>Aghhh!</i>

13:24.620 --> 13:25.655
<i>Grab the cabinet!</i>

13:25.758 --> 13:26.448
<i>Okay.</i>

13:26.551 --> 13:27.275
<i>Come on, come on!</i>

13:35.482 --> 13:36.586
Gunshots.

13:36.689 --> 13:37.827
Joe I need to
get inside.

13:37.931 --> 13:40.034
<i>No I'm not going to put
you in jeopardy as well.</i>

13:40.137 --> 13:41.620
<i>SWAT's on the way.</i>

13:47.965 --> 13:48.724
Move, let's go!

13:48.827 --> 13:49.758
<i>They're
going to go in.</i>

13:49.862 --> 13:50.965
<i>And then we're
going to do our thing.</i>

13:51.068 --> 13:52.172
No but they're going
to escalate things.

13:52.275 --> 13:53.310
And somebody's
going to get hurt.

13:53.827 --> 13:55.068
All right!

13:55.172 --> 13:56.896
<i>I want you two to get eyes
on all entrances and exits!</i>

14:02.724 --> 14:03.689
<i>Door!</i>

14:04.241 --> 14:05.068
<i>Barricade the door!</i>

14:05.172 --> 14:06.413
<i>Come on,
come on, come on!</i>

14:09.482 --> 14:10.482
Someone over there!

14:10.586 --> 14:12.000
<i>I need you to
circle around-</i>

14:12.103 --> 14:12.862
<i>and make sure that noboy
leaves this building!</i>

14:12.965 --> 14:13.862
<i>Go!</i>

14:15.413 --> 14:16.241
<i>Boss!</i>

14:16.344 --> 14:17.482
<i>Jesse listen.</i>

14:17.586 --> 14:19.586
<i>I've got a list of
the names of people</i>

14:19.689 --> 14:21.862
who were recently laid
off from this office.

14:21.965 --> 14:22.931
I want you
to go through

14:23.034 --> 14:24.655
and see if any of them
could be our shooter.

14:24.758 --> 14:26.206
Focus on males between
20 and 40 years old.

14:26.310 --> 14:27.103
I'm on it.

14:29.206 --> 14:29.965
<i>Check in with Hastings!</i>

14:30.068 --> 14:31.000
<i>Go see if he
needs help!</i>

14:31.103 --> 14:31.689
Give me a second.

14:31.793 --> 14:32.448
Sergeant!

14:33.068 --> 14:33.724
Donovan.

14:33.827 --> 14:34.482
What have we got?

14:34.586 --> 14:35.517
<i>What do we know?</i>

14:35.620 --> 14:36.689
<i>We have two officers
in the building-</i>

14:36.793 --> 14:37.758
<i>with no way of communication.</i>

14:39.379 --> 14:40.310
We need to
flip the table.

14:40.413 --> 14:41.241
Uh- you.

14:41.344 --> 14:42.068
Big man- Howie.

14:42.172 --> 14:44.448
<i>Wyatt, move those chairs.</i>

14:50.000 --> 14:50.758
<i>Nina! Nina!</i>

14:50.862 --> 14:51.827
<i>Behind!
Come here!</i>

14:52.896 --> 14:55.206
<i>Nowhere left to run!</i>

14:55.310 --> 14:57.172
<i>Are we ready to
get serious now?</i>

15:07.448 --> 15:09.137
<i>Open the door!</i>

15:09.241 --> 15:10.034
<i>I know you're
in there!</i>

15:10.793 --> 15:11.896
<i>Hey!</i>

15:12.000 --> 15:13.275
<i>Open up!</i>

15:14.137 --> 15:16.103
<i>Very clever!</i>

15:18.551 --> 15:20.689
<i>You know you can't keep
me out forever huh?</i>

15:23.172 --> 15:24.172
<i>Can he
still see us?</i>

15:24.275 --> 15:26.896
Shhh.

15:34.103 --> 15:35.241
<i>Where are you?</i>

15:45.034 --> 15:46.655
<i>What, do you think
I'm some kind of joke?</i>

15:46.758 --> 15:48.034
We need to flip
the table, come on.

15:48.137 --> 15:49.068
<i>I'm not
messing around here!</i>

15:49.172 --> 15:50.103
<i>We're too exposed.</i>

15:56.448 --> 15:57.206
<i>Help me with
the credenza.</i>

15:57.310 --> 15:58.000
Come on.

16:02.206 --> 16:03.206
Hi.

16:03.310 --> 16:03.896
Hi!

16:04.000 --> 16:04.551
<i>Felicia-</i>

16:04.655 --> 16:05.689
Charlie.

16:05.793 --> 16:06.379
Hi.

16:06.482 --> 16:07.793
Pleasure
to meet you!

16:11.448 --> 16:12.034
Who is it?

16:12.137 --> 16:13.068
What's he doing?

16:13.827 --> 16:15.310
Uh-

16:15.413 --> 16:16.517
Don't know yet.

16:35.517 --> 16:36.655
Come on, come on!

16:46.827 --> 16:49.275
Any of you
recognize this man?

16:49.379 --> 16:50.068
Oh that's-

16:50.172 --> 16:50.931
that's Louis!

16:51.034 --> 16:51.586
<i>What?</i>

16:51.689 --> 16:52.413
<i>Yeah.</i>

16:52.517 --> 16:53.862
Louis Phalen!

16:53.965 --> 16:55.862
He got let go
in the downsizing.

16:55.965 --> 16:57.448
What can you tell
me about him?

16:57.551 --> 16:58.827
<i>He's awkward!</i>

16:58.931 --> 17:00.931
Poor fella can't tell
a joke to save himself.

17:01.034 --> 17:02.931
<i>He had a huge chip
on his shoulder.</i>

17:03.034 --> 17:04.586
Some of the
things he said-

17:04.689 --> 17:05.413
But I neverguessed-

17:05.517 --> 17:06.379
he'd do something
like this!

17:06.482 --> 17:07.172
<i>No!
Mmmm.</i>

17:19.827 --> 17:21.137
Come on pal.

17:42.689 --> 17:43.310
Take it.

17:43.413 --> 17:44.206
Take it.

17:46.586 --> 17:47.241
What are you doing?

17:47.344 --> 17:48.724
Kind of hard
to explain.

17:57.517 --> 17:58.172
Come on pal.

18:01.137 --> 18:02.655
<i>Take it.</i>

18:26.586 --> 18:27.620
<i>Good job pal.</i>

18:31.275 --> 18:32.310
<i>Leave with it.</i>

18:32.413 --> 18:33.172
Leave.

18:49.068 --> 18:50.103
<i>What are you doing?</i>

18:50.206 --> 18:52.172
<i>The outside
lines are disconnected.</i>

18:52.275 --> 18:53.793
But maybe the internal
lines are working.

18:53.896 --> 18:55.206
Nina what's your extension?

18:55.310 --> 18:56.413
1127.

19:20.655 --> 19:21.862
Hi Louis.

19:21.965 --> 19:23.068
My name's Charlie.

19:24.241 --> 19:25.310
Oh.

19:25.413 --> 19:26.413
Hi Charlie.

19:26.517 --> 19:27.689
I guess you realized-

19:27.793 --> 19:29.793
<i>I couldn't disconnect the
internal phone lines huh?</i>

19:29.896 --> 19:30.517
<i>Congrats!</i>

19:30.620 --> 19:31.758
<i>Nice one!</i>

19:31.862 --> 19:33.034
Well that was a good job
disconnecting the outside lines.

19:33.137 --> 19:34.793
Yeah I know.

19:34.896 --> 19:36.206
I'm not an idiot.

19:36.310 --> 19:37.068
No, not at all.

19:37.172 --> 19:37.931
<i>Because I know
what I'm doing.</i>

19:38.034 --> 19:38.896
I can tell.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.172
I got that.

19:40.275 --> 19:41.241
So-

19:42.172 --> 19:44.448
what exactly is
it that you want

19:44.551 --> 19:45.689
<i>from all this huh?</i>

19:45.793 --> 19:47.000
I want-

19:47.103 --> 19:48.379
I just want to
send a message.

19:48.482 --> 19:49.517
Uh-huh.

19:49.620 --> 19:50.689
<i>I want to give
my former co-workers-</i>

19:50.793 --> 19:53.172
the goodbye they deserve!

19:54.793 --> 19:55.931
<i>That's all!</i>

19:58.931 --> 19:59.482
<i>Guys!</i>

19:59.586 --> 20:00.448
<i>Okay.</i>

20:00.551 --> 20:01.310
So of six
former employees-

20:01.413 --> 20:02.206
two are women.

20:02.310 --> 20:03.379
I managed to get
three on the phone.

20:03.482 --> 20:04.793
<i>But there's one
unaccounted for.</i>

20:04.896 --> 20:06.344
Louis Phalen.

20:06.448 --> 20:07.517
Louis Phalen?

20:09.620 --> 20:10.482
Rex!

20:10.586 --> 20:12.413
Hey hey!

20:12.517 --> 20:14.206
<i>What have you
got there, buddy?</i>

20:14.310 --> 20:14.931
<i>Here, let me see.</i>

20:15.034 --> 20:15.793
<i>Let me see,
come on.</i>

20:15.896 --> 20:16.551
<i>What is that?</i>

20:17.275 --> 20:18.965
A cell phone jammer!

20:19.068 --> 20:20.034
Maybe that's why
Charlie isn't answering.

20:20.793 --> 20:21.896
Okay, it's off.

20:23.310 --> 20:24.000
Trying him now.

20:24.103 --> 20:26.793
Oh I'm so happy
to see you.

20:26.896 --> 20:27.965
<i>Donovan.</i>

20:28.068 --> 20:30.482
The shooter has the front
and back exits blocked.

20:30.586 --> 20:32.034
We're going to need to
break through the doors.

20:32.137 --> 20:33.310
Our guys don't
have a visual.

20:33.413 --> 20:34.344
Has your guy
made the contact?

20:34.448 --> 20:35.724
We just opened the
phone lines, right now.

20:35.827 --> 20:36.758
We're going to
need a minute.

20:36.862 --> 20:37.793
I'll get the
team in position.

20:37.896 --> 20:38.482
Not yet.

20:38.586 --> 20:39.413
Sarah, it's time!

20:39.517 --> 20:40.103
Go!

20:41.448 --> 20:42.482
Text from Charlie!

20:42.586 --> 20:43.172
Wait!

20:43.275 --> 20:44.689
<i>Hold on!</i>

20:44.793 --> 20:45.862
<i>Secure.</i>

20:45.965 --> 20:47.172
One injured, no fatalities.

20:47.275 --> 20:48.172
He's talking to
the shooter.

20:49.413 --> 20:50.620
Rex!

20:50.724 --> 20:52.758
<i>He's not going to leave
Charlie alone in there.</i>

20:52.862 --> 20:54.206
Listen, Detective Hudson
is negotiating right now.

20:54.310 --> 20:55.517
We could have a peaceful
resolution here!

20:58.655 --> 20:59.551
We'll give
Hudson a chance.

20:59.655 --> 21:01.241
But we need to be
ready to move in Sir.

21:01.344 --> 21:03.827
What your team needs to do is
secure entry to the building.

21:03.931 --> 21:04.517
<i>Quietly.</i>

21:04.620 --> 21:05.275
<i>Okay?</i>

21:05.379 --> 21:06.896
<i>We can't
spook this guy!</i>

21:07.000 --> 21:09.275
We will talk about
next steps after this.

21:11.172 --> 21:12.137
You were right, Jesse.

21:12.241 --> 21:13.413
He says the shooter's
name is Louis Phalen.

21:13.517 --> 21:14.931
So anything we
can learn about him-

21:15.034 --> 21:16.068
can help Charlie
take him down.

21:16.172 --> 21:17.793
Okay, let's see what
we can find out.

21:19.310 --> 21:20.000
<i>So Louis.</i>

21:20.103 --> 21:20.896
<i>What's it
going to take-</i>

21:21.000 --> 21:22.931
to get all of us
out of here safely?

21:24.241 --> 21:25.586
<i>Safely?</i>

21:26.724 --> 21:27.862
No, man.

21:28.551 --> 21:30.482
No, that's
not the plan.

21:31.000 --> 21:31.724
<i>The plan.</i>

21:31.827 --> 21:32.896
The plan.

21:33.000 --> 21:33.586
Okay.

21:33.689 --> 21:35.000
Tell me about
the plan.

21:40.862 --> 21:43.275
Who the hell are
you anyway Charlie?

21:43.379 --> 21:44.413
<i>Hey look.</i>

21:44.517 --> 21:45.793
I'm just a-

21:45.896 --> 21:47.586
<i>I'm just a guy.</i>

21:47.689 --> 21:50.448
<i>A customer.</i>

21:50.551 --> 21:53.655
<i>I came to get some
home insurance okay?</i>

21:53.758 --> 21:54.482
<i>Oh I see.</i>

21:54.586 --> 21:55.689
<i>Wrong place
wrong time-</i>

21:55.793 --> 21:57.275
type of situation.

21:57.551 --> 21:59.000
Yeah, something like that.

22:00.241 --> 22:01.931
How's your life
insurance Charlie?

22:03.827 --> 22:04.655
Hey, Louis.

22:04.758 --> 22:05.448
Look, I know.

22:05.551 --> 22:06.275
You don't know me.

22:06.379 --> 22:07.517
But I'm here.

22:08.517 --> 22:10.034
I'm listening.

22:11.448 --> 22:12.413
Cool!

22:12.517 --> 22:14.103
Well I've got
no beef with you-

22:14.206 --> 22:15.206
<i>Mr. Nice Guy.</i>

22:15.310 --> 22:16.793
<i>So just-</i>

22:16.896 --> 22:18.068
<i>you know-</i>

22:18.172 --> 22:19.068
<i>keep your
head down and-</i>

22:20.137 --> 22:21.379
maybe you'll be fine!

22:24.965 --> 22:26.551
Louis, you haven't
hurt anybody yet.

22:26.655 --> 22:27.655
You can stop
this right now.

22:33.413 --> 22:34.586
<i>No.</i>

22:35.137 --> 22:35.896
<i>You hear me?</i>

22:36.000 --> 22:36.896
<i>No!</i>

22:37.000 --> 22:38.931
<i>Today is the day-</i>

22:39.034 --> 22:40.517
<i>where all these
smug jerks-</i>

22:40.620 --> 22:42.931
<i>they finally realize
what happens-</i>

22:43.034 --> 22:44.275
when they
underestimate me!

22:44.379 --> 22:46.172
<i>Me!</i>

22:46.275 --> 22:46.827
<i>You hear that?</i>

22:48.758 --> 22:50.000
<i>I'm coming for you!</i>

22:51.413 --> 22:52.482
You've been underestimated.

22:52.586 --> 22:53.689
Yeah.

22:53.793 --> 22:55.620
<i>That can really
get to a person.</i>

22:55.724 --> 22:56.793
<i>I get that.</i>

22:56.896 --> 22:59.103
They shouldn't underestimate me.

22:59.206 --> 23:00.655
<i>Yeah.</i>

23:03.172 --> 23:04.758
I'm listening.

23:06.689 --> 23:07.620
<i>Look man.</i>

23:07.724 --> 23:09.172
This is between
me and Felicia okay?

23:09.275 --> 23:10.241
Not you.

23:10.344 --> 23:11.103
<i>So do you
know her?</i>

23:11.206 --> 23:12.172
<i>Do you know
where she is?</i>

23:12.275 --> 23:13.758
<i>I mean I've looked
all around the office.</i>

23:13.862 --> 23:14.758
<i>And she's not there.</i>

23:14.862 --> 23:16.310
<i>So she must
be somewhere!</i>

23:16.413 --> 23:17.758
What's between
you and Felicia?

23:18.413 --> 23:19.068
Me?

23:24.448 --> 23:26.551
Sneaky sneaky little Felicia.

23:26.655 --> 23:28.655
She's with you,
isn't she?

23:32.103 --> 23:34.758
<i>She's hiding in there
with you, isn't she?</i>

23:34.862 --> 23:35.724
<i>Stay down.</i>

23:35.827 --> 23:37.517
<i>Like a little rat.</i>

23:37.620 --> 23:38.862
Hiding.

23:45.068 --> 23:45.793
<i>Felicia!</i>

23:45.896 --> 23:46.448
<i>Come out!</i>

23:46.551 --> 23:47.482
<i>Come out okay?</i>

23:47.586 --> 23:48.448
<i>You can't hide anymore!</i>

23:48.551 --> 23:49.206
<i>Okay.</i>

23:49.310 --> 23:50.172
<i>Okay Charlie.</i>

23:50.275 --> 23:51.620
<i>You want to know
what, Mr. Calm Guy?</i>

23:51.724 --> 23:52.689
<i>I have a
deal for you.</i>

23:52.793 --> 23:53.793
<i>I'm going to tell
you something.</i>

23:54.827 --> 23:56.068
<i>You want this
to be over right?</i>

23:56.172 --> 23:57.965
That's what
I want too.

23:58.068 --> 23:59.827
So send her out.

24:00.586 --> 24:01.793
<i>Charles?</i>

24:04.379 --> 24:05.310
<i>You want it
to be over?</i>

24:05.413 --> 24:06.241
Send her out!

24:06.344 --> 24:07.000
<i>I can't do that.</i>

24:07.655 --> 24:08.655
<i>Send her out!</i>

24:08.758 --> 24:10.103
<i>I'm waiting.</i>

24:10.206 --> 24:11.517
I can give a
message to her.

24:11.620 --> 24:13.000
<i>What would
you like to say?</i>

24:16.862 --> 24:18.793
What would you
like to say to her?

24:21.206 --> 24:23.241
Tell her that
from now on-

24:23.344 --> 24:25.310
it's only going
to get worse.

24:25.413 --> 24:28.172
And it's all
her fault.

24:52.206 --> 24:53.517
<i>Louis Phalen.</i>

24:53.896 --> 24:55.206
<i>28 years old.</i>

24:55.310 --> 24:56.379
No criminal history.

24:56.482 --> 24:57.448
He's a local kid.

24:57.551 --> 24:59.862
Bachelor of Commerce
at Heritage U.

24:59.965 --> 25:00.896
<i>He was employed-</i>

25:01.000 --> 25:02.413
at the insurance office
for two years.

25:02.517 --> 25:04.137
Did he live alone?

25:05.758 --> 25:06.413
Looks like he-

25:06.517 --> 25:07.241
moved in with
his mother-

25:07.344 --> 25:08.379
a few months ago.

25:08.482 --> 25:11.137
So financial problems
after he lost his job?

25:11.241 --> 25:12.724
Or maybe a breakup?

25:12.827 --> 25:14.241
Yeah, I'm checking
his socials.

25:14.344 --> 25:15.275
<i>Okay Charlie says-</i>

25:15.379 --> 25:17.517
<i>he's got the staff
barricaded together.</i>

25:17.620 --> 25:18.620
SWAT wants
to go in.

25:18.724 --> 25:19.482
<i>No no no.</i>

25:19.586 --> 25:20.620
You've got to
give him time.

25:20.724 --> 25:21.793
Yeah that's
what I told them.

25:21.896 --> 25:23.103
<i>I have Louis's
mother's number here.</i>

25:23.206 --> 25:24.034
Do we notify her?

25:24.137 --> 25:24.931
<i>Well you never
know-</i>

25:25.310 --> 25:27.241
what effect family could
have on an active suspect.

25:27.344 --> 25:29.034
The chances are they
make things worse.

25:29.137 --> 25:30.241
I'd like to
talk to her.

25:30.344 --> 25:31.344
We keep family away.

25:31.448 --> 25:32.310
<i>Yeah but Louis
doesn't have to know-</i>

25:32.413 --> 25:33.310
that she's here.

25:33.413 --> 25:34.586
<i>That's
not protocol Sarah.</i>

25:34.689 --> 25:36.655
Joe, any information we get
could be useful to Charlie!

25:37.655 --> 25:38.310
Please.

25:39.482 --> 25:40.275
Okay.

25:40.379 --> 25:41.620
Okay, but we keep
her out of sight.

25:41.724 --> 25:42.793
Thank you.

25:42.896 --> 25:44.103
Okay.

25:49.379 --> 25:50.275
Felicia.

25:50.379 --> 25:51.655
Any reason why he
has it out for you?

25:51.758 --> 25:54.103
He has it out for me because
I'm the one who fired him.

25:54.206 --> 25:56.172
<i>Head office told me-</i>

25:56.275 --> 25:57.275
we had to
make cuts!

25:57.379 --> 25:58.413
<i>No, it's
not your fault.</i>

25:58.517 --> 26:01.206
He's the kind of person
who always has to-

26:01.310 --> 26:02.310
<i>blame someone else
for his problems.</i>

26:02.413 --> 26:03.517
<i>He didn't
get on with people.</i>

26:03.620 --> 26:04.482
He's lonely.

26:04.586 --> 26:05.793
I think work was
the only thing he had

26:05.896 --> 26:06.724
to pin his
hopes on.

26:06.827 --> 26:07.724
How did he
handle it-

26:07.827 --> 26:09.034
the day that
you let him go?

26:09.137 --> 26:13.206
I tried to make it clear it
was a cost-cutting measure!

26:13.310 --> 26:14.758
He was one of the
most recent hires-

26:14.862 --> 26:16.862
so one of
the first to go!

26:16.965 --> 26:18.827
He had some kind
of conspiracy theory-

26:18.931 --> 26:20.689
that Felicia
was firing him-

26:20.793 --> 26:22.379
because she had
to hire more women.

26:22.482 --> 26:24.172
<i>I told him
that was crazy.</i>

26:24.275 --> 26:25.034
<i>But-</i>

26:25.137 --> 26:27.379
people believe
what they need to.

26:27.482 --> 26:29.655
You're not going to make
me go out there, are you?

26:29.758 --> 26:30.862
<i>No,
of course not.</i>

26:30.965 --> 26:32.275
We're in this together.

26:33.586 --> 26:34.896
<i>Yeah?</i>

26:36.103 --> 26:37.034
<i>Yeah.</i>

26:38.724 --> 26:39.413
<i>Remain calm!</i>

26:39.517 --> 26:40.620
<i>And remain in place!</i>

26:40.724 --> 26:42.586
<i>Help is on
the way!</i>

26:51.379 --> 26:52.655
It's been quiet
for a while.

26:52.758 --> 26:54.931
<i>Yeah I think I have a lead
on this guy's online activity.</i>

26:55.034 --> 26:56.068
He's really into
this men's group.

26:56.172 --> 26:57.689
That's unfortunate.

27:01.379 --> 27:02.034
Are you okay?

27:02.655 --> 27:03.620
Yeah.

27:12.689 --> 27:13.655
Come on, come on, come on.

27:15.379 --> 27:16.103
It's Charlie.

27:17.862 --> 27:18.827
<i>Charlie, hey.</i>

27:18.931 --> 27:20.206
Hey, Jesse.

27:20.310 --> 27:21.275
Are you on to
our shooter?

27:21.379 --> 27:21.965
<i>Yeah yeah.</i>

27:22.068 --> 27:22.620
<i>Louis Phalen.</i>

27:22.724 --> 27:23.551
<i>He's a former employee.</i>

27:23.655 --> 27:24.931
Well I'm getting
the story-

27:25.034 --> 27:27.275
<i>from his co-workers
right now.</i>

27:27.379 --> 27:29.000
Sounds like being
let go set him off.

27:29.103 --> 27:30.344
But I'm sure there's
other grievances.

27:30.448 --> 27:31.862
Yeah,
he does.

27:31.965 --> 27:32.724
He's
had trouble-

27:32.827 --> 27:33.896
finding a girlfriend.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.758
<i>But what he did find was
a mens' group online-</i>

27:35.862 --> 27:38.241
<i>that thinks women
are the problem.</i>

27:42.103 --> 27:43.551
Yeah, you keep
me posted.

27:43.655 --> 27:44.310
Thanks.

27:46.620 --> 27:48.482
SWAT is in the process
of removing the back door.

27:48.586 --> 27:49.620
It's slow going-

27:49.724 --> 27:51.586
because they don't want
to alert the shooter.

27:51.689 --> 27:54.413
Jesse is getting strong
incel vibes from this guy.

27:54.517 --> 27:55.379
Oh that's great.

27:55.482 --> 27:57.172
Yeah he's talking
to Charlie now.

27:57.275 --> 27:57.827
<i>Excuse me!</i>

27:57.931 --> 27:58.689
Ma'am!

27:58.793 --> 27:59.551
<i>You cannot go
through there!</i>

27:59.655 --> 28:00.655
<i>Please stand back.</i>

28:00.758 --> 28:02.206
But my son, he
works in there!

28:02.310 --> 28:03.931
And the offices they
said are blocked off!

28:04.034 --> 28:05.655
<i>Is he all right?</i>

28:05.758 --> 28:06.482
Mrs. Phalen.

28:06.586 --> 28:07.793
We spoke
on the phone.

28:07.896 --> 28:08.758
Um-

28:08.862 --> 28:10.103
Come with me.

28:13.724 --> 28:14.413
Okay.

28:14.517 --> 28:15.379
Yeah, thanks Jesse.

28:17.551 --> 28:18.655
Howie, stay back.

28:18.758 --> 28:19.793
<i>No it's
too hot in
here!</i>

28:19.896 --> 28:20.724
<i>I've got to get
out of here!</i>

28:20.827 --> 28:22.275
It's not safe
out there.

28:22.379 --> 28:23.965
He's going to come back
right in here anyway.

28:24.068 --> 28:25.034
<i>Howie!</i>

28:25.137 --> 28:26.241
<i>What difference
does it make man?</i>

28:26.344 --> 28:28.931
<i>It's only a matter of time
before he gets in here.</i>

28:29.034 --> 28:29.724
<i>No Howie, stop!</i>

28:30.103 --> 28:30.931
Ughh!

28:32.931 --> 28:34.000
<i>We need
to stay under cover.</i>

28:34.103 --> 28:34.862
<i>No!</i>

28:35.931 --> 28:36.655
<i>Howie!</i>

28:36.758 --> 28:38.310
<i>It's too hot!</i>

28:40.344 --> 28:41.413
<i>Come back Howie!</i>

28:41.517 --> 28:42.551
<i>Stop struggling!</i>

28:43.862 --> 28:44.413
<i>Hey!</i>

28:44.517 --> 28:45.413
Hey stop!

28:45.517 --> 28:46.379
<i>I'm going
to shoot!</i>

28:46.482 --> 28:47.068
<i>I'm sick man!</i>

28:47.172 --> 28:48.000
<i>I need a medic!</i>

28:48.103 --> 28:49.034
<i>We need
an ambulance.</i>

28:49.137 --> 28:49.965
<i>What is this?</i>

28:50.068 --> 28:50.931
<i>Some kind
of trick man?</i>

28:51.034 --> 28:52.034
<i>I need
to get out!</i>

28:52.137 --> 28:53.275
<i>Stop moving man!</i>

28:53.379 --> 28:54.344
<i>Man do you know
what a gun is?</i>

28:54.448 --> 28:56.655
<i>I'm going to put a
bullet inside of you!</i>

28:56.758 --> 28:57.413
<i>I can't breathe!</i>

28:57.517 --> 28:58.896
<i>Stop moving!</i>

28:59.000 --> 28:59.827
<i>Stop it man!</i>

29:11.931 --> 29:12.793
Ughh!

29:15.724 --> 29:16.379
Rex!

29:20.655 --> 29:21.379
<i>Don't shoot!</i>

29:21.482 --> 29:22.310
<i>Don't shoot!</i>

29:27.931 --> 29:28.689
<i>Shot fired!</i>

29:28.793 --> 29:30.172
<i>Shot fired!</i>

29:30.275 --> 29:30.931
Mrs. Phalen: <i>Sweet Lord!</i>

29:31.034 --> 29:32.000
My boy is
in there.

29:32.103 --> 29:33.517
<i>Mrs. Phalen.</i>

29:33.620 --> 29:35.758
There isn't an easy
way to tell you this.

29:35.862 --> 29:36.620
Mrs. Phalen:
<i>What is it?</i>

29:36.724 --> 29:37.689
Is he hurt,
is he-?

29:37.793 --> 29:38.724
<i>We have
reason to believe-</i>

29:38.827 --> 29:40.620
that Louis is
the shooter.

29:44.379 --> 29:45.172
<i>Did he
have access</i>-

29:45.275 --> 29:45.965
<i>to guns?</i>

29:47.241 --> 29:48.620
He's never used
a gun in his life!

29:48.724 --> 29:49.931
He's not a
violent person!

29:50.034 --> 29:51.724
<i>No, you must
be mistaken.</i>

29:52.620 --> 29:53.965
We have reliable
eyewitness statements-

29:54.068 --> 29:56.310
saying that he is
currently inside with a gun.

29:59.517 --> 30:00.241
Is anyone hurt?

30:00.344 --> 30:02.482
Has he hurt
anyone in there?

30:02.586 --> 30:03.793
<i>Everyone is alive.</i>

30:03.896 --> 30:07.827
And we would like to help make
sure that it stays that way.

30:07.931 --> 30:08.896
So um-

30:09.000 --> 30:11.517
<i>has Louis's behaviour
changed recently?</i>

30:13.379 --> 30:14.068
Well-

30:15.379 --> 30:17.000
Uh-

30:17.103 --> 30:19.000
Well, yes.

30:19.103 --> 30:20.586
He's been more
angry lately.

30:23.620 --> 30:25.655
I tried to raise
him to be kind.

30:25.758 --> 30:26.655
<i>I told him-</i>

30:26.758 --> 30:27.758
Forget about
the girl-

30:27.862 --> 30:28.793
who doesn't
like you back.

30:28.896 --> 30:30.000
<i>Don't focus on her!</i>

30:30.103 --> 30:30.827
<i>There are more
fish in the sea!</i>

30:33.586 --> 30:35.241
But he doesn't listen
to his mother!

30:35.344 --> 30:36.620
<i>I think he
was listening</i>-

30:36.724 --> 30:38.000
to someone online.

30:42.896 --> 30:44.310
<i>Great to see you pal.</i>

30:53.241 --> 30:54.379
It's okay.

30:57.344 --> 30:58.034
Stay back.

31:11.482 --> 31:12.172
<i>He stabbed me!</i>

31:12.275 --> 31:14.758
<i>You stabbed me!</i>

31:14.862 --> 31:16.620
<i>Oh that's
messed up man!</i>

31:16.724 --> 31:19.862
<i>You messed
up big time!</i>

31:27.586 --> 31:28.862
<i>Wyatt! Wyatt!</i>

31:36.448 --> 31:37.551
Aghhh!

31:38.241 --> 31:39.862
<i>Aghh!</i>

31:39.965 --> 31:40.620
<i>Damn it!</i>

32:11.379 --> 32:12.034
<i>What?</i>

32:13.068 --> 32:15.103
That man out there
needs medical attention.

32:15.206 --> 32:16.551
<i>It's not too
late for him.</i>

32:16.655 --> 32:17.827
Charlie.

32:17.931 --> 32:19.620
The guy that just
threw a knife at me-

32:19.724 --> 32:20.517
and almost
broke my hand?

32:20.620 --> 32:21.379
What are you
talking about?

32:21.482 --> 32:22.413
You want to
be friends now?

32:22.517 --> 32:23.482
<i>I'm sorry
about that Louis.</i>

32:23.586 --> 32:25.137
But I don't want you
to hurt these people.

32:25.241 --> 32:26.931
That man's name
out there is Howie.

32:27.034 --> 32:27.862
<i>He's got kids.</i>

32:27.965 --> 32:29.448
<i>And it's not too
late to help him.</i>

32:30.517 --> 32:32.275
What happened?

32:32.379 --> 32:33.000
I didn't shoot him.

32:33.103 --> 32:33.931
I don't know
the guy.

32:34.034 --> 32:35.275
<i>He had a
heart attack okay?</i>

32:35.379 --> 32:37.172
<i>So put the gun down and get
the paramedics up here now!</i>

32:37.275 --> 32:38.310
<i>Come on!</i>

32:38.413 --> 32:39.482
Louis!

32:55.344 --> 32:56.103
Charlie.

32:56.206 --> 32:56.862
He's moving.

32:59.862 --> 33:01.344
<i>He doesn't look good.</i>

33:12.172 --> 33:13.827
I don't think
he's doing well.

33:15.551 --> 33:16.586
<i>His face is grey.</i>

33:16.689 --> 33:18.034
<i>I don't think he's going
to make it Charlie.</i>

33:20.620 --> 33:21.931
That's not good Louis.

33:27.793 --> 33:28.862
You can stop this.

33:29.379 --> 33:30.448
<i>Okay?</i>

33:30.551 --> 33:31.965
<i>Before anyone
else gets hurt.</i>

33:32.068 --> 33:33.379
Look at you.

33:34.172 --> 33:35.344
Pretending to
be my friend

33:35.448 --> 33:37.379
just because I'm the
bad guy with the gun.

33:45.896 --> 33:46.896
Didn't you come
here today

33:47.000 --> 33:48.827
to try and make
somebody understand

33:48.931 --> 33:50.793
<i>where you're coming from?</i>

33:50.896 --> 33:52.793
<i>All this planning-</i>

33:52.896 --> 33:55.172
willingness to
get yourself hurt-

33:55.275 --> 33:57.172
<i>for your cause.</i>

33:57.275 --> 33:59.896
<i>All so that somebody would know
what you're going through?</i>

34:01.965 --> 34:03.000
I'm listening.

34:04.724 --> 34:06.586
What do you know about
my problems Mr. Perfect?

34:06.689 --> 34:09.241
<i>Do you ever feel
so worthless-</i>

34:09.344 --> 34:13.896
that you can't
even talk to a girl-

34:14.000 --> 34:14.827
or keep a job?

34:16.241 --> 34:17.310
<i>Do you?</i>

34:17.413 --> 34:20.379
No I'm thinking if someone's
not going to like you-

34:20.482 --> 34:24.413
that's got to
be pretty lonely.

34:24.517 --> 34:26.103
Yeah.

34:26.206 --> 34:28.827
And thinking that you're
not going to measure up-

34:28.931 --> 34:30.620
maybe I shouldn't
even try-

34:30.724 --> 34:32.586
that's no
way to live.

34:32.689 --> 34:34.206
<i>But Louis-</i>

34:34.310 --> 34:37.034
<i>you have the choice how
you handle your situation.</i>

34:37.137 --> 34:39.689
<i>And I think you know that
something is wrong here.</i>

34:39.793 --> 34:41.103
You're a smart guy.

34:41.206 --> 34:42.206
Oh yeah.

34:42.310 --> 34:44.758
That's what everybody in
here has been telling me.

34:44.862 --> 34:47.448
Yeah I bet that's
what they told you.

34:47.551 --> 34:49.620
<i>You are a
smart guy.</i>

34:49.724 --> 34:51.620
You broke a
little bit today.

34:53.931 --> 34:55.620
But I can
understand that.

34:57.103 --> 34:59.310
<i>I think other people will be
willing to understand that.</i>

34:59.413 --> 35:02.275
I wanted them to understand
that they messed up.

35:02.379 --> 35:06.758
They need to understand
the order of things.

35:06.862 --> 35:10.482
They need to learn that women
don't deserve everything.

35:11.655 --> 35:13.620
Whose words are
these, Louis?

35:14.517 --> 35:16.310
I think you're listening
to the wrong people.

35:17.103 --> 35:17.758
No, look.

35:17.862 --> 35:19.034
I can think
for myself okay?

35:19.137 --> 35:19.724
<i>Yeah you can
think for yourself.</i>

35:19.827 --> 35:21.965
So do it now.

35:22.068 --> 35:22.827
You feel bad
about Howie.

35:22.931 --> 35:24.172
<i>Don't you?</i>

35:28.862 --> 35:30.793
Yeah.

35:30.896 --> 35:33.689
You can put
the gun down.

35:35.068 --> 35:35.620
No.

35:35.724 --> 35:36.482
<i>Get him help.</i>

35:36.586 --> 35:37.517
It's just too
late for me.

35:37.620 --> 35:38.517
Louis.

35:38.620 --> 35:39.551
<i>No.</i>

35:39.655 --> 35:42.000
Charlie I can't
go back out there.

35:42.103 --> 35:43.931
Listen to me.

35:45.620 --> 35:48.344
You have the
power to stop this-

35:48.448 --> 35:49.241
before anyone else gets-

36:07.137 --> 36:08.068
Mrs. Phalen: <i>He's
been disappointed-</i>

36:08.172 --> 36:10.137
in so many ways.

36:14.275 --> 36:17.103
He was young when
his father died.

36:17.206 --> 36:20.310
So Louis didn't have a
male role model, right?

36:22.620 --> 36:25.000
I'm sure you
did your best.

36:25.103 --> 36:26.448
But he was
a sweet boy.

36:27.379 --> 36:29.448
Whatever's happened
to him lately-

36:29.551 --> 36:31.275
I'm sorry I
couldn't fix it.

36:31.379 --> 36:33.931
But can you let those
cops out there know-

36:34.034 --> 36:36.965
that that's
still my boy.

36:37.482 --> 36:38.068
I will.

36:38.172 --> 36:38.758
Mrs. Phalen: <i>I mean-</i>

36:38.862 --> 36:39.896
how would
he get a gun?

36:40.758 --> 36:42.448
He doesn't know
people like that!

36:44.275 --> 36:45.275
<i>Sarah.</i>

36:45.379 --> 36:46.482
He joined this
online group-

36:47.034 --> 36:48.206
<i>and had been posting
quite frequently</i>

36:48.896 --> 36:49.965
<i>ever since he
lost his job.</i>

36:50.068 --> 36:51.137
<i>This one other user-</i>

36:51.241 --> 36:51.896
Maestro-

36:52.000 --> 36:52.724
answered every post.

36:52.827 --> 36:54.586
Like encouraging him?

36:54.689 --> 36:55.586
Indoctrinating.

36:55.689 --> 36:58.724
You know- hyping violence
against normies.

36:59.482 --> 37:00.931
A role model.

37:01.551 --> 37:02.689
Poor kid.

37:02.793 --> 37:04.068
So three days ago-

37:04.172 --> 37:05.482
Maestro tells Louis that he
can help him get what he needs.

37:05.586 --> 37:07.275
And then their public
conversation ends.

37:07.379 --> 37:09.310
<i>I want to keep
reading their DMs.</i>

37:09.413 --> 37:11.241
But it's going to
take some time.

37:11.344 --> 37:12.965
But if Maestro did
help Louis get guns-

37:13.068 --> 37:15.862
then that would
mean he was local.

37:15.965 --> 37:17.241
Maybe, yeah.

37:17.344 --> 37:18.103
Find out
who he is.

37:18.206 --> 37:18.827
<i>Okay.</i>

37:18.931 --> 37:20.689
Okay.

37:21.655 --> 37:22.620
<i>Damn it.</i>

37:22.724 --> 37:24.482
The back door is
going to be open soon.

37:24.586 --> 37:25.517
<i>How do
we get there?</i>

37:25.620 --> 37:27.137
We've lost the
element of surprise-

37:27.241 --> 37:28.517
with the whole
filing cabinet thing.

37:30.344 --> 37:31.482
Rex and I will
distract him.

37:32.206 --> 37:32.965
Wait.

37:33.068 --> 37:34.344
What do you mean
by distraction?

37:35.137 --> 37:35.896
I don't know.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.103
We'll think of something.

37:44.620 --> 37:45.379
Don't do it!

37:45.482 --> 37:46.413
Let the SWAT
guys come in!

37:46.517 --> 37:48.172
When the SWAT guys
come in, the kid's dead.

37:48.275 --> 37:49.241
Better him than you!

37:51.448 --> 37:52.517
Yeah I know,
buddy, I know.

37:52.620 --> 37:53.586
<i>Come on pal.</i>

37:53.689 --> 37:54.655
<i>It's time for
a distraction.</i>

38:15.344 --> 38:17.034
So if Maestro
is local-

38:17.137 --> 38:18.620
he might not have set
all this in motion-

38:18.724 --> 38:20.068
just to watch
it on the news.

38:20.172 --> 38:21.689
Yeah, do you think
he's somewhere nearby?

38:21.793 --> 38:24.448
You said he
egged Louis on?

38:24.551 --> 38:26.413
Yeah I just feel like Louis
wouldn't have done all this-

38:26.517 --> 38:27.793
without Maestro
pulling the strings.

38:27.896 --> 38:28.793
I agree.

38:28.896 --> 38:30.172
And if so, then
there's a good chance

38:30.275 --> 38:33.068
Maestro would have wanted a
front row seat to his handiwork.

38:33.172 --> 38:34.344
Yeah.

38:34.448 --> 38:36.413
Okay I'm going to see if I
can track him to his socials.

38:36.517 --> 38:37.379
- Okay.
- Find a photo.

38:48.068 --> 38:49.482
<i>Are you
sure about this?</i>

38:49.586 --> 38:51.000
Uh- nope!

38:57.724 --> 38:59.172
<i>Okay, talk
to Louis, pal.</i>

39:05.310 --> 39:06.379
Hey!

39:18.310 --> 39:19.103
<i>Aghhh!</i>

39:43.000 --> 39:43.551
Right over there!

39:43.655 --> 39:44.241
Mm-hmm.

39:44.344 --> 39:45.000
It must be.

39:47.068 --> 39:48.206
<i>Is there
anything more-</i>

39:48.310 --> 39:49.172
<i>that you need from
me Superintendent?</i>

39:49.275 --> 39:50.172
<i>No, that
won't be necessary.</i>

39:50.275 --> 39:51.482
<i>We can get you all
finished up here.</i>

39:51.586 --> 39:53.103
<i>We've gotten word-</i>

39:53.206 --> 39:53.827
<i>that your friends are
on the way out safely.</i>

39:53.931 --> 39:55.517
<i>So you can
go see them.</i>

39:55.620 --> 39:56.344
Oh thank you,
thank you.

39:56.448 --> 39:57.172
Yeah, okay.

40:00.068 --> 40:02.620
Are you okay?

40:05.827 --> 40:06.482
Okay, hold on.

40:06.586 --> 40:07.586
Let me-

40:11.448 --> 40:12.137
Hold on.

40:12.241 --> 40:13.034
Okay okay.

40:13.137 --> 40:14.068
Joe- Joe.

40:22.655 --> 40:25.551
<i>Joe, let his mother
have a minute with him?</i>

40:25.655 --> 40:26.517
<i>Yeah, he's secure.</i>

40:26.620 --> 40:27.517
But just
for a minute.

40:27.620 --> 40:28.482
Okay.

40:28.586 --> 40:29.586
You can talk to
him more in holding.

40:31.413 --> 40:32.517
Please.

40:39.724 --> 40:40.517
Hey.

40:40.620 --> 40:41.862
Hey, I don't know
if it's anything.

40:41.965 --> 40:45.137
But in one message, Maestro
says he's got two guns.

40:45.241 --> 40:45.827
No.

40:45.931 --> 40:47.103
No they searched Louis.

40:47.206 --> 40:49.413
And they said
he only had one, so-

40:49.517 --> 40:50.103
Let's find Maestro.

40:50.206 --> 40:51.000
We'll go
pick him up.

40:51.103 --> 40:53.206
Okay, Sarah says
he might be nearby.

40:53.310 --> 40:54.586
How close are you
to finding an ID?

40:54.689 --> 40:55.344
I'm almost there.

40:55.448 --> 40:56.172
I'm almost there.

40:56.275 --> 40:57.620
I'm just checking
his socials-

40:57.724 --> 40:58.862
looking for a photo.

40:58.965 --> 41:00.068
<i>We need
you to hurry.</i>

41:00.172 --> 41:01.206
<i>I know.</i>

41:01.310 --> 41:02.206
<i>This isn't over until
we've got him too.</i>

41:02.310 --> 41:03.551
<i>I know.</i>

41:03.655 --> 41:05.137
<i>Maestro's looking at hard
time for causing all of this.</i>

41:05.896 --> 41:06.931
<i>There he is.</i>

41:09.172 --> 41:10.103
Joe.

41:10.206 --> 41:12.000
<i>I saw this guy in
the crowd out there.</i>

41:17.103 --> 41:17.827
<i>Hi there!</i>

41:17.931 --> 41:20.137
<i>I'm Special Constable Mills.</i>

41:20.241 --> 41:21.655
Are you the
one they call-

41:21.758 --> 41:23.172
Maestro?

41:25.448 --> 41:26.103
Gun!

41:26.206 --> 41:26.896
Gun!

41:27.379 --> 41:28.137
Get him!

41:29.379 --> 41:30.655
Turn around!

41:30.758 --> 41:31.793
Hey.

41:31.896 --> 41:32.965
Good luck having internet
privileges in prison.

41:34.551 --> 41:35.206
Come on.

41:35.758 --> 41:36.827
Get him
out of here!

41:42.965 --> 41:44.034
Good job.

41:44.344 --> 41:45.172
Thank you.
