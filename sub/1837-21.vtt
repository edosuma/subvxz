WEBVTT

00:07.734 --> 00:11.600
Hey, Chel, let's show my dad
how we can set a table.

00:11.600 --> 00:13.500
Great idea, Raven.

00:13.500 --> 00:15.834
See how gracefully
I use this tray

00:15.834 --> 00:20.000
to carry various cups,
plates and silverware.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.800
And look how I can
take this napkin.

00:22.800 --> 00:23.900
Oh. A napkin.

00:23.900 --> 00:27.900
And magically turn it
into a swan...

00:29.033 --> 00:32.467
And still have time
to do my schoolwork.

00:32.467 --> 00:34.133
Let me guess.

00:34.133 --> 00:36.767
You two want to be waitresses
at The Chill Grill.

00:36.767 --> 00:39.033
That never entered our minds,

00:39.033 --> 00:41.767
but if you want us to,
we accept.

00:41.767 --> 00:42.867
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:42.867 --> 00:44.467
Waitressing
is a big responsibility.

00:44.467 --> 00:47.300
It's hard work and you two
don't have any experience.

00:47.300 --> 00:50.300
Dad, please.
We're smart, ambitious.

00:50.300 --> 00:51.400
Yeah, a-and

00:51.400 --> 00:52.967
we kinda need the money
for a ski trip.

00:52.967 --> 00:54.133
So you'd rather

00:54.133 --> 00:56.367
earn the money than ask for it.

00:56.367 --> 00:57.800
Exactly, Dad.

00:57.800 --> 01:01.367
Unless asking for it would work,
'cause we'd go either way.

01:02.700 --> 01:04.367
I'd go with the earning.

01:04.367 --> 01:07.900
Okay, so, Dad... are we hired?

01:07.900 --> 01:09.200
You start tomorrow.

01:09.200 --> 01:10.300
Yes.
What?!

01:10.300 --> 01:12.300
Oh, this is so exciting.

01:12.300 --> 01:15.200
I've always, always
wanted to be a waitress.

01:15.200 --> 01:16.400
Well...

01:16.400 --> 01:17.500
No. That's not true.

01:17.500 --> 01:19.934
Actually, I always
wanted to be a princess.

01:19.934 --> 01:22.233
But, like, I guess,
unless your dad's,

01:22.233 --> 01:23.734
like, Hakim or something,

01:23.734 --> 01:25.834
those jobs are
really hard to get.

Hello, welcome
to The Chill Grill.

02:25.867 --> 02:29.400
My name is Raven,
and<i>this </i>is my winning smile.

02:32.133 --> 02:33.300
I should hope so.

02:33.300 --> 02:35.500
Those braces cost a fortune.

02:35.500 --> 02:36.767
Next.

02:38.400 --> 02:40.834
Hello. Welcome
to The Chill Grill.

02:40.834 --> 02:42.033
My name is Flo.

02:42.033 --> 02:43.967
I'll be your server.

02:44.867 --> 02:45.934
Flo?

02:45.934 --> 02:47.033
Yeah, you know, "Chelsea"

02:47.033 --> 02:48.567
doesn't really
sound very waitressy.

02:48.567 --> 02:49.600
Plus I'm kinda

02:49.600 --> 02:51.400
saving that
for my princess name.

02:52.600 --> 02:54.567
Okay, Rae...

02:54.567 --> 02:55.734
Flo.

02:55.734 --> 02:57.367
Show time.

03:00.400 --> 03:01.400
Hi. Hello.

03:01.400 --> 03:02.600
Welcome to The Chill Grill.

03:02.600 --> 03:04.500
My name is Raven,
and I'll be your server.

03:04.500 --> 03:06.867
What can I get you today?

03:06.867 --> 03:08.300
Rae, I got to talk to you.

03:08.300 --> 03:09.300
I'm working.

03:09.300 --> 03:11.500
I'm having love problems.

03:11.500 --> 03:12.734
It's my first day
on the job.

03:12.734 --> 03:14.000
Look, it's about
me and Andrea.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.100
I think it's over, Rae.

03:15.100 --> 03:16.734
You know what?
It's time for my break.

03:18.567 --> 03:19.500
I don't get it.

03:19.500 --> 03:20.934
You two are
a perfect couple.

03:20.934 --> 03:22.133
I thought so, too.

03:22.133 --> 03:23.200
You know what?

03:23.200 --> 03:24.767
I gotta get you guys
back together.

03:24.767 --> 03:26.400
Her dad is our ride
to the ski trip.

03:26.400 --> 03:29.200
Hey. Hello.

03:29.200 --> 03:31.233
I'm sorry.

03:31.233 --> 03:32.300
I am<i>so </i>sorry.

03:32.300 --> 03:33.467
You guys know
what you want?

03:33.467 --> 03:34.500
ALL:
Yeah.

03:34.500 --> 03:35.600
Okay. Great.
You know what?

03:35.600 --> 03:37.033
You're the captain
of the table.

03:37.033 --> 03:38.600
I need you to
write it all down.

03:41.200 --> 03:43.600
All right, so that's
one chicken sandwich.

03:44.834 --> 03:47.100
Guess you're not
a vegetarian.

03:47.100 --> 03:49.767
All right, so that's one
cute, cocky, feathery,

03:49.767 --> 03:51.600
formerly living
chicken sandwich.

03:51.600 --> 03:54.133
Would you like a side
of shame with that?

03:55.900 --> 03:57.667
Thank you so much.

03:57.667 --> 03:59.000
Come again.

04:01.934 --> 04:03.867
Andrea, girl, just
come on down here

04:03.867 --> 04:05.467
and we'll talk
it out, okay?

04:05.467 --> 04:06.600
Good. Good.

04:06.600 --> 04:07.767
So, um...

04:07.767 --> 04:09.300
(<i>clearing throat </i>)

04:09.300 --> 04:10.467
How's your dad?

04:10.467 --> 04:12.400
Car's working good?

04:12.400 --> 04:14.000
Oh. Okay.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
Thanks. That's good.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.100
So, what's she say?

04:18.100 --> 04:19.934
Car's just got a tune-up.

04:19.934 --> 04:22.000
About me, Rae.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.100
Oh, you in<i>trouble.</i>

04:30.800 --> 04:33.667
You get one birthday
party a year, William.

04:33.667 --> 04:35.500
You want to make it cool.

04:35.500 --> 04:36.667
Well...

04:36.667 --> 04:39.600
I invited all the
cool people I know.

04:42.133 --> 04:44.834
The Math Club?

04:44.834 --> 04:47.600
The Chess Team?

04:47.600 --> 04:51.000
The gang from Abdul's
Computer Shack?

04:51.000 --> 04:56.233
Those guys can download
some serious fun.

04:56.233 --> 04:58.100
I'll make some calls.

04:58.100 --> 05:00.133
Now, what about
entertainment?

05:00.133 --> 05:03.133
Mom hired a clown.

05:03.133 --> 05:04.400
A clown?

05:05.600 --> 05:07.800
Like with an ugly
red nose, freaky hair

05:07.800 --> 05:10.300
and a painted-on smile
that never goes away?

05:10.300 --> 05:12.300
That's what we're paying for.

05:12.300 --> 05:14.734
Is it too late
to get your money back?

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
Somebody pick up.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
I'm starving.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.900
Rae. Chelsea.

05:22.600 --> 05:25.100
So what's
up, Andrea?

05:25.100 --> 05:28.367
"D" to the "R"
to the "Aea"?

05:28.367 --> 05:29.800
See, Eddie.

05:29.800 --> 05:31.934
That is exactly
what I'm talking about.

05:31.934 --> 05:34.133
You're always
joking around.

05:34.133 --> 05:35.667
Yeah, he's<i>so </i>funny.

05:35.667 --> 05:36.700
It's always like

05:36.700 --> 05:38.200
joke after joke
after joke...

05:38.200 --> 05:39.300
Chelsea.

05:41.600 --> 05:42.967
Well, look, baby, I...

05:42.967 --> 05:45.667
If it'll make things right
between us, then, look.

05:45.667 --> 05:47.200
My clowning days are over.

05:47.200 --> 05:49.200
You would do that for me?

05:49.200 --> 05:50.100
Of course.

05:53.033 --> 05:54.500
Now, you see
what happens

05:54.500 --> 05:57.000
when you become aware
of other people's needs?

05:58.300 --> 05:59.400
(<i>bell ringing </i>)

05:59.400 --> 06:00.934
Oh, come on.

06:00.934 --> 06:03.233
What is that
annoying bell?

06:03.233 --> 06:04.133
Really.

06:04.133 --> 06:05.767
RAVEN:
I don't know, but

06:05.767 --> 06:08.300
it's getting closer.

06:09.600 --> 06:11.767
Rae, what are you two doing?

06:11.767 --> 06:13.400
Just bringing
people together.

06:13.400 --> 06:15.934
How about bringing people
some sandwiches?

06:15.934 --> 06:18.233
Do you realize how many
complaints I've been getting?

06:18.233 --> 06:19.767
Okay, who's complaining?

06:19.767 --> 06:22.467
Oh. You tattle-tales.

06:24.367 --> 06:25.600
Oh, no.

06:25.600 --> 06:27.600
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!

06:27.600 --> 06:28.834
People, please.

06:28.834 --> 06:29.967
Please, come back.

06:29.967 --> 06:31.934
Look, free desserts
for everyone.

06:31.934 --> 06:33.600
What? Free desserts?

06:33.600 --> 06:37.000
Man, this is the
coolest job ever.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.033
Chels, I don't think
we're getting any.

06:40.033 --> 06:41.767
Oh...

06:41.767 --> 06:44.200
What have you done?

06:44.200 --> 06:45.500
Dad, we're really sorry,.

06:45.500 --> 06:47.400
We promise we'll
be better tomorrow.

06:47.400 --> 06:49.734
Tomorrow? You two aren't
coming in tomorrow.

06:49.734 --> 06:50.800
I gave you a chance

06:50.800 --> 06:51.900
and you let me down.

06:51.900 --> 06:53.600
I am so disappointed in you.

06:53.600 --> 06:54.967
But Dad...
No.

06:54.967 --> 06:56.500
There is nothing you can say.

06:56.500 --> 06:58.600
You both are fired.

06:58.600 --> 07:00.066
(<i>gasps </i>)

07:04.200 --> 07:05.767
(<i>moans </i>)

07:05.767 --> 07:08.300
Dad, Chelsea and I
are really sorry, okay?

07:08.300 --> 07:10.300
We know we messed up business
pretty bad.

07:10.300 --> 07:12.600
You had every right to fire us.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.500
Yes, I did.

07:14.500 --> 07:16.700
Okay, you didn't have to agree
so fast.

07:16.700 --> 07:20.200
But if you just give us
a second chance,

07:20.200 --> 07:22.033
I promise,
we won't let you down.

07:22.033 --> 07:23.900
Now where have I heard
that before?

07:23.900 --> 07:26.300
Oh, right when I gave you
the first chance.

07:26.300 --> 07:27.800
Forget it, Rae.

07:27.800 --> 07:29.600
Dad...

07:31.867 --> 07:32.934
Rae, thanks.

07:32.934 --> 07:34.834
I've never seen
the place so crowded.

07:34.834 --> 07:36.567
(<i>applause </i>)

07:40.500 --> 07:42.600
Dad, I just had
the best vision ever.

07:42.600 --> 07:44.834
The Chill Grill
was packed with people.

07:44.834 --> 07:46.367
Rae, if you think

07:46.367 --> 07:48.233
I'm going to change my mind,
just because...

07:48.233 --> 07:50.233
How many people we talking?

07:50.233 --> 07:53.967
Mobbed. And you were thanking me
for getting them all there.

07:53.967 --> 07:55.500
I'm just saying.

07:55.500 --> 07:58.467
And how do you plan on getting
all these customers?

07:58.467 --> 08:00.100
I don't know.

08:00.100 --> 08:04.033
But I will, somehow, if you
just give us another chance.

08:04.033 --> 08:06.467
We won't disappoint you.

08:08.934 --> 08:10.967
Okay. One chance.

08:10.967 --> 08:11.967
One! One!

08:11.967 --> 08:13.133
Oh, thank you, Dad.
Thank you, Dad.

08:13.133 --> 08:14.800
Thank you.
Oh, Chels, we're rehired.

08:14.800 --> 08:16.300
I know, I heard.
I can't believe it

08:16.300 --> 08:18.700
'cause if I were your dad,
I would never in a million...

08:29.734 --> 08:32.033
Chels, I got great news.

08:32.033 --> 08:33.100
I've got great news.

08:33.100 --> 08:34.000
I booked
a private party.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.400
I booked a private party.

08:35.400 --> 08:36.233
Mine's for tonight.

08:36.233 --> 08:38.300
Mine's for tonight.

08:38.300 --> 08:39.667
Why are you repeating
what I'm saying?

08:39.667 --> 08:41.600
I'm not repeating what
you're saying. It's true.

08:41.600 --> 08:44.100
It's true?
Okay, now,
you're doing it.

08:44.100 --> 08:46.033
Okay, let me get
this straight.
Okay.

08:46.033 --> 08:48.400
We both booked a private party
for tonight?

08:48.400 --> 08:51.100
I think so, 'cause
I booked the San
Francisco Bike Club.

08:51.100 --> 08:52.767
I booked the Bayview
Knitting Society.

08:52.767 --> 08:56.000
Oh, well, at least
we didn't book the
same club, right?

08:56.000 --> 08:57.967
That would've been bad.

08:57.967 --> 08:59.300
Chels.
Yeah?

08:59.300 --> 09:01.500
My dad is going to have
to deal with two angry groups

09:01.500 --> 09:04.033
who both think that they have
the place to themselves.

09:09.667 --> 09:12.033
Make that three
angry groups.

09:12.033 --> 09:16.567
Oh, man,
we are<i>so </i>re-fired.

09:24.600 --> 09:25.767
No, no, no, Cory,

09:25.767 --> 09:27.367
William cannot have
his birthday here, okay?

09:27.367 --> 09:29.600
We have two other parties
going on here tonight.

09:29.600 --> 09:30.600
Uh-uh.

09:30.600 --> 09:31.834
Dad said I could.

09:31.834 --> 09:33.367
I'm helping him out--

09:33.367 --> 09:35.233
bringing in some business.

09:35.233 --> 09:36.233
Okay, where's Dad?

09:36.233 --> 09:37.300
I got to talk to him.

09:37.300 --> 09:39.233
He went to pick up
Banto the clown.

09:39.233 --> 09:42.100
Yutzo.

09:42.100 --> 09:43.667
You'll love him, Cory.

09:43.667 --> 09:45.767
He gets right up
in your face.

09:45.767 --> 09:48.567
Where's William?!

09:48.567 --> 09:50.400
Oh, Miss Mildred
and the knitting crew.

09:50.400 --> 09:51.367
Hi.

09:51.367 --> 09:56.467
"Benjamin, Zachary, Abdul?"

09:56.467 --> 09:59.400
None of these names
are right.

09:59.400 --> 10:00.500
Ladies, please, please,

10:00.500 --> 10:01.700
don't get too comfortable.

10:01.700 --> 10:03.600
We're still working
out the seating, okay?

10:03.600 --> 10:06.867
KIDS:
Happy Birthday!

10:08.834 --> 10:10.367
It's not my birthday.

10:10.367 --> 10:12.734
Is it?

10:12.734 --> 10:14.000
(<i>motorcycles roaring </i>)

10:14.000 --> 10:16.800
Ooh, Chelsea, I think
your bike club is here.

10:16.800 --> 10:18.467
Oh, it's these
kind of bikes.

10:18.467 --> 10:20.367
I was picturing
like, ding-ding,

10:20.367 --> 10:22.600
not like vroom-vroom!

10:22.600 --> 10:25.834
All right, everybody clear out!

10:25.834 --> 10:27.000
This is a private party!

10:27.000 --> 10:31.467
This is our party.

10:31.467 --> 10:33.567
Stand your ground, ladies.

10:33.567 --> 10:34.734
This is our party.

10:34.734 --> 10:36.133
Oh, I beg your pardon.

10:36.133 --> 10:37.767
We called.
There's no way.

10:37.767 --> 10:40.867
Hold it, hold it, hold it,
hold it! Cut it!

10:40.867 --> 10:42.400
Hold up!

10:42.400 --> 10:44.467
Now why don't you take this
outside?

10:44.467 --> 10:48.100
And if you see a clown,
don't let him in.

10:48.100 --> 10:51.467
(<i>phone ringing </i>)

10:51.467 --> 10:53.400
People, people,

10:53.400 --> 10:54.300
I'm going to be answering
the phone,

10:54.300 --> 10:55.300
in case anyone cares.

10:55.300 --> 10:56.934
Do you care?

10:56.934 --> 10:58.467
I guess not.

10:59.700 --> 11:01.667
Hello. Oh, hi, Dad.

11:01.667 --> 11:04.834
Yes, everything is going great.

11:04.834 --> 11:06.467
Yutzo!

11:08.000 --> 11:09.734
Look, baby,
my car broke down

11:09.734 --> 11:11.200
and I'm going
to be a little late.

11:11.200 --> 11:13.233
Okay, that's enough!

11:14.700 --> 11:16.700
What? How late?

11:16.700 --> 11:17.734
I don't know.

11:17.734 --> 11:19.000
It's going to be a while.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.734
Look, it's just a kid's
birthday party.

11:20.734 --> 11:22.867
I'm sure you can handle it.

11:22.867 --> 11:23.900
(<i>horn beeping </i>)

11:23.900 --> 11:26.000
Okay. Oh, oh, and tell Maurice

11:26.000 --> 11:27.233
the assistant chef

11:27.233 --> 11:29.600
to start cooking
the pizza without me.

11:29.600 --> 11:31.233
Oh, okay, Dad, yes.

11:31.233 --> 11:33.834
Everything is under control.

11:33.834 --> 11:35.400
I have faith in you.

11:39.300 --> 11:40.934
Chels, my dad
is going to be late.

11:40.934 --> 11:42.100
I have to go tell Maurice

11:42.100 --> 11:43.834
to make three times
as many pizzas.

11:43.834 --> 11:46.900
Maurice, no, don't quit
on me, man!

11:46.900 --> 11:48.600
Why do you go
got to be like that?

11:48.600 --> 11:50.700
Come on!

11:54.000 --> 11:55.200
What, no grub?

11:56.467 --> 11:57.400
Let's roll, boys.

11:57.400 --> 11:59.467
Let's roll, girls.

11:59.467 --> 12:01.467
Let's roll, Mommy.

12:01.467 --> 12:03.934
No, no, rolling.

12:03.934 --> 12:05.667
No rolling allowed, no.

12:05.667 --> 12:07.300
Now everyone is going
to get fed,

12:07.300 --> 12:09.100
and I promise you
it's going to be

12:09.100 --> 12:11.834
the most amazing dining
experience of your lives.

12:13.100 --> 12:15.367
Cool plan, Rae.
How we going to do that?

12:15.367 --> 12:16.500
No idea.

12:16.500 --> 12:19.100
But my vision has
to come true, okay?

12:19.100 --> 12:22.000
I cannot disappoint
my dad again.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.500
This place has to be
packed with happy people

12:23.500 --> 12:26.000
as soon as he gets here.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.867
Meeting, back room, now.

12:28.867 --> 12:30.934
Happiness, happiness.

12:30.934 --> 12:34.100
Oh, Rae, come here.

12:34.100 --> 12:37.233
"For my two favorite
new waitresses.

12:37.233 --> 12:40.367
Ski you later, Dad."

12:40.367 --> 12:42.500
Oh, man, my dad
probably bought
these skis

12:42.500 --> 12:44.300
for us on our first day.

12:44.300 --> 12:48.200
Oh, but he fired us
instead.

12:48.200 --> 12:49.967
That's so sweet.

12:49.967 --> 12:51.400
Chels, okay, just forget
about the skis.

12:51.400 --> 12:55.700
We have to figure out
how to feed that
angry mob, okay?

12:55.700 --> 12:58.400
Hey, do you think
they'd eat these
big balls of dough?

12:58.400 --> 13:01.400
Maybe if we turned
them into pizzas.

13:01.400 --> 13:03.233
Even better!
I know, I know.

13:03.233 --> 13:07.033
Okay, I see my dad
do this a lot.

13:07.033 --> 13:08.500
You kind of put it
in the flour like that

13:08.500 --> 13:10.367
just kind of knead it
a little bit,

13:10.367 --> 13:12.900
knead it around,
I think, make it a circle.

13:12.900 --> 13:14.033
Oh, look, Chels,
I can do it.

13:14.033 --> 13:16.400
Kind of just turn it,
turn it.

13:16.400 --> 13:19.133
We're making dough,
we're making dough.

13:20.600 --> 13:23.300
You see that?
I'm fly.

13:23.300 --> 13:26.000
Kneading dough. Oh!
Knead, knead.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.300
Oh!

13:28.300 --> 13:30.233
We just got to wait
for it to come down.

13:31.500 --> 13:34.200
Uh, I don't know what kind
of party y'all throwing,

13:34.200 --> 13:35.934
but there's a biker
bench-pressing

13:35.934 --> 13:37.100
an old lady out there.

13:37.100 --> 13:38.400
Eddie, thank goodness
you're here.

13:38.400 --> 13:39.700
We so need your help
right now.

13:39.700 --> 13:41.000
Cool. I owe you anyway.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.100
Thanks to you,

13:42.100 --> 13:43.400
me and Andrea are
back together.

13:43.400 --> 13:45.467
Just got to keep my promise,
and, you know,

13:45.467 --> 13:46.667
stay more serious about things.

13:46.667 --> 13:47.700
So what can I do?

13:47.700 --> 13:49.233
Well...

13:49.233 --> 13:51.100
Where's the clown?

13:51.100 --> 13:54.567
He's going to be late.

13:54.567 --> 13:56.700
If you want
to avoid legal action,

13:56.700 --> 13:58.834
I suggest you find
a replacement.

14:08.967 --> 14:10.800
Uh, why y'all looking at me?

14:13.467 --> 14:14.500
ALL:
We want the clown!

14:14.500 --> 14:15.500
No, we don't.

14:15.500 --> 14:17.300
We want the clown!
No, we don't.

14:17.300 --> 14:18.734
We want the clown!

14:18.734 --> 14:19.967
No, we don't!

14:21.667 --> 14:25.600
Cory, I'm sensing
some clown issues.

14:25.600 --> 14:29.600
Me? No stupid clown
can scare me.

14:29.600 --> 14:32.033
Hey, everybody, look who's here!

14:32.033 --> 14:33.667
Hey, it's me,

14:33.667 --> 14:35.400
Foodface the clown.

14:36.467 --> 14:38.000
(<i>screams </i>)

14:42.600 --> 14:43.667
What are you...?

14:43.667 --> 14:44.900
What is this!

14:44.900 --> 14:46.100
Well, you see,

14:46.100 --> 14:47.200
it'd probably
take too long

14:47.200 --> 14:48.600
to make a bunch
of little pizzas,

14:48.600 --> 14:50.600
so why not just make one

14:50.600 --> 14:53.400
giant pizza?

14:53.400 --> 14:54.467
You know what, Chels?

14:54.467 --> 14:55.734
That's a good idea.

14:55.734 --> 14:56.734
Thank you.

14:56.734 --> 14:58.100
Except for one thing.

14:58.100 --> 15:02.033
We don't have a
a giant oven!

15:02.033 --> 15:03.033
I just thought

15:03.033 --> 15:04.300
I'd let you know

15:04.300 --> 15:08.133
Foodface the clown
is very disturbing.

15:08.133 --> 15:10.100
William, please,
we have bigger problems.

15:10.100 --> 15:12.000
We are trying
to figure out
how to cook

15:12.000 --> 15:14.400
a ten-foot pizza
with no oven.

15:14.400 --> 15:16.500
My second-grade science
project.

15:16.500 --> 15:18.000
Don't play with me, William.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.734
Can you really
cook this thing?

15:19.734 --> 15:23.233
I just need
a power source
and a conductor.

15:23.233 --> 15:26.300
I'm sure I can scrape
something up.

15:26.300 --> 15:27.500
Okay, then,
hook that up.

15:27.500 --> 15:28.667
Let's get
this puppy ready.

15:28.667 --> 15:29.667
Let's... Ooh,

15:29.667 --> 15:30.967
let's dump the sauce.

15:30.967 --> 15:32.367
Dump the sauce, boss.

15:35.467 --> 15:38.133
Uh, boss, how do we
spread the sauce?

15:38.133 --> 15:40.767
I'm at a loss.

15:40.767 --> 15:42.467
Unless, of course...

15:45.567 --> 15:49.967
All right, Chels,
ski Mt. Sauce.

15:52.667 --> 15:54.834
Chels, I'm not used
to this, Chels!

15:54.834 --> 15:56.500
I know. That looks painful.

15:56.500 --> 15:57.800
It is! Get over here!

15:57.800 --> 16:01.000
Go, go, go!

16:01.000 --> 16:02.400
All right, I got it.
I got it. I got it.

16:02.400 --> 16:04.000
I'm ready. I'm ready.
I'm ready. Watch out.

16:04.000 --> 16:07.600
Stay away from me!

16:07.600 --> 16:10.200
Will you stop running
from me, Cory?

16:10.200 --> 16:11.667
How do you know
my name?!

16:11.667 --> 16:13.233
I've known you
all my life!

16:13.233 --> 16:15.500
What's your problem,
clown dude?

16:15.500 --> 16:17.467
You like scaring little kids?

16:17.467 --> 16:19.400
Uh, no, your largeness.

16:19.400 --> 16:23.100
Actually, I was just
helping out a friend.

16:23.100 --> 16:24.033
Unhand that clown.

16:24.033 --> 16:25.767
Back off, granny!

16:25.767 --> 16:31.200
Who are you calling
granny, dirtball?

16:31.200 --> 16:33.834
I'm sorry.

16:33.834 --> 16:36.033
I'm sometimes get cranky
when I'm hungry.

16:37.967 --> 16:40.300
Now, why don't you do
a funny dance

16:40.300 --> 16:42.000
for the children?

16:42.000 --> 16:43.800
Well, actually, you know,
I don't do the dance...

16:43.800 --> 16:44.967
She said dance, clown!

16:44.967 --> 16:46.033
All right!

16:47.100 --> 16:48.567
This is for you, kid.

16:48.567 --> 16:50.300
Laugh it up.

16:51.300 --> 16:53.734
Spread it around evenly.

16:53.734 --> 16:56.600
I'm spreading!
I'm spreading!

16:56.600 --> 16:58.867
I'm going to put
some more sauce on, Rae.

16:58.867 --> 17:00.667
Over here.

17:00.667 --> 17:02.033
I like this.

17:02.033 --> 17:03.700
I think I got it.
I like this.

17:03.700 --> 17:04.800
Give me some cheese.

17:09.934 --> 17:11.734
On the pizza.

17:14.700 --> 17:17.500
Oh, yeah, I'm James Brown.

17:17.500 --> 17:20.567
There's some cheese, Raven.
Cheese over there.

17:20.567 --> 17:21.934
All right, okay.

17:23.734 --> 17:24.767
Where's the pepperoni?

17:24.767 --> 17:26.367
Pepperoni? Good idea.

17:26.367 --> 17:28.734
I'm putting it
in the middle

17:28.734 --> 17:31.567
so you can put it around.

17:31.567 --> 17:32.567
Spread it evenly now, Rae.

17:32.567 --> 17:33.934
I'm trying to.

17:33.934 --> 17:35.133
They should put this
pizza skiing in the Olympics.

17:35.133 --> 17:37.200
Yeah, you could win a medal.

17:41.300 --> 17:42.400
Ooh, Rae, are you okay?

17:42.400 --> 17:44.734
Chels, look,

17:44.734 --> 17:46.233
sauce angels!

17:46.233 --> 17:48.400
Oh, Rae,
they're beautiful.

17:50.000 --> 17:53.200
Bring it up. Bring it up.

17:53.200 --> 17:56.200
I'm Foodface the clown.
I'm Foodface the clown.

17:56.200 --> 17:57.200
(<i>laughing </i>)

17:57.200 --> 17:58.967
Oh, hey, Andrea.
How you doing?

17:58.967 --> 18:00.734
Eddie?

18:01.934 --> 18:04.100
I thought you said
you were going to be serious.

18:04.100 --> 18:05.300
It's over.

18:06.200 --> 18:08.467
No, Andrea, no,
I wasn't clowning.

18:08.467 --> 18:10.033
I was just clowning.

18:13.600 --> 18:15.467
Now that's funny!

18:15.467 --> 18:16.800
Yes!

18:24.233 --> 18:25.867
Eddie, you're Foodface?

18:25.867 --> 18:28.100
Yeah, man, I just didn't want
to blow my cover

18:28.100 --> 18:29.467
in front of the kids.

18:29.467 --> 18:34.500
I never told anybody this,
but I'm afraid of clowns.

18:34.500 --> 18:35.734
Really? I mean,

18:35.734 --> 18:37.800
'cause the way you ran away
from me in terror,

18:37.800 --> 18:38.934
I would have
never guessed, Cory.

18:40.200 --> 18:42.233
Come here.
It's cool.

18:45.967 --> 18:48.233
Okay, William,
let me get this straight.

18:48.233 --> 18:50.667
The energy from
the motorcycles

18:50.667 --> 18:54.133
is going to heat up
the knitting needles

18:54.133 --> 18:55.300
and cook the pizza?

18:55.300 --> 18:57.900
It worked in second grade.

18:59.934 --> 19:02.500
Gentlemen, start your engines!

19:02.500 --> 19:05.900
(<i>zapping </i>)

19:09.700 --> 19:11.100
It's working!

19:11.100 --> 19:13.300
It's working!

19:13.300 --> 19:16.567
Hey, everybody, who wants
a slice of pizza?

19:16.567 --> 19:17.734
We only get one slice?

19:17.734 --> 19:20.133
Trust me, that's all
you're going to need.

19:23.934 --> 19:25.600
Whoa!

19:25.600 --> 19:28.400
Come on, guys.
Let's give 'em a hand.

19:28.400 --> 19:31.000
I meant with the pizza!

19:33.100 --> 19:34.233
Hot, hot, hot, hot!

19:34.233 --> 19:36.500
Dig in, everybody.

19:45.233 --> 19:48.300
Yo, dude, it's
not just big...

19:48.300 --> 19:50.200
it's good.

19:50.200 --> 19:54.667
This certainly is
a unique dining
experience.

19:58.300 --> 19:59.734
Hey, sorry, I'm late.

19:59.734 --> 20:01.600
Oh, Dad, I'm so glad
you're here.

20:01.600 --> 20:05.500
Wow, William's got
some interesting friends.

20:07.767 --> 20:11.300
Yeah, well, Chelsea and I
thought that why have one party

20:11.300 --> 20:12.467
when you can have three?

20:12.467 --> 20:13.467
Yep.

20:13.467 --> 20:14.900
Is this your daughter?

20:14.900 --> 20:16.734
She throws quite
a shindig.

20:16.734 --> 20:17.900
Oh, thank you.

20:17.900 --> 20:19.667
But I'm just
doing my job.
This is the man

20:19.667 --> 20:21.000
that made it all happen.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.100
You know what?
Ladies and gentlemen,

20:23.100 --> 20:24.500
please listen up.

20:24.500 --> 20:27.300
I want to introduce you
to the owner of the Chill Grill,

20:27.300 --> 20:29.300
my dad.

20:30.200 --> 20:31.500
Great job! Great job!

20:35.200 --> 20:36.900
Thanks.

20:36.900 --> 20:38.000
I never seen the place
so crowded.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.600
Great job!

20:41.400 --> 20:44.300
Just like you
saw it, Rae.

20:44.300 --> 20:47.834
Dad, I want
to thank you

20:47.834 --> 20:49.200
for believing
in my vision.

20:49.200 --> 20:50.934
Let me let you in
on a little secret.

20:50.934 --> 20:52.467
I didn't believe
in your vision.

20:52.467 --> 20:54.600
I believed in you.

20:54.600 --> 20:57.300
Thank you.

20:57.300 --> 21:00.066
Hey, how did Maurice cook
that big pizza?

21:00.066 --> 21:02.500
Oh, hey, Dad, let's enjoy
the party first

21:02.500 --> 21:05.100
and ask questions
later. Okay.

21:10.867 --> 21:12.567
Cory, come on, man.

21:12.567 --> 21:14.000
You can do this.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.200
You have got
to face your fears, man.

21:16.200 --> 21:17.300
Go on.

21:22.000 --> 21:22.600
Yutzo,

21:23.500 --> 21:26.767
I just want you to know...

21:26.767 --> 21:27.934
I'm not afraid of you.

21:32.500 --> 21:34.467
Thanks. That was pretty cool.

21:34.467 --> 21:36.500
(<i>horn beeps </i>)

21:39.000 --> 21:40.500
Thanks for the clowning.

21:42.500 --> 21:44.033
So how you doing, man?

21:44.033 --> 21:45.834
I'm good.

21:45.834 --> 21:48.834
You know, clowns
aren't scary.

21:51.500 --> 21:54.467
(<i>laughing </i>)

21:55.800 --> 21:57.834
But they are annoying.

21:57.834 --> 21:59.400
