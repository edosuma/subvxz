WEBVTT

00:07.001 --> 00:10.770
Now she never even plays with him.

00:10.838 --> 00:13.239
She never plays with anything.

00:13.306 --> 00:16.452
I'm afraid that your daughter's
increasing lack of affect

00:16.520 --> 00:18.881
is all part of her ongoing
withdrawal from the world.

00:18.939 --> 00:20.340
I don't know what that means--

00:20.407 --> 00:21.744
"withdrawal from the world."

00:25.088 --> 00:27.228
Is she going through
some kind of depression?

00:27.296 --> 00:29.128
Can a 12-year-old even be depressed?

00:29.196 --> 00:32.301
Doctor, I need someone to tell me
what's going on with my daughter.

00:32.369 --> 00:36.496
Your daughter's having delusions,
hallucinations.

00:36.564 --> 00:38.391
She's displaying something

00:38.459 --> 00:40.520
that we call "disorganized speech."

00:40.588 --> 00:42.618
And while I'm not about to diagnosis her

00:42.685 --> 00:44.015
from across the room,

00:44.083 --> 00:46.813
I will tell you that these
are all classic symptoms

00:46.881 --> 00:50.045
of early onset paranoid schizophrenia.

00:52.346 --> 00:54.847
Schizophrenia?

00:54.915 --> 00:58.784
It's clear to me that she's very, very sick.

00:58.851 --> 01:00.817
I'm sorry, you're just wrong.

01:00.885 --> 01:02.352
She's not sick.

01:02.420 --> 01:04.019
She's just going through something.

01:09.227 --> 01:10.660
Oh, God.

01:10.728 --> 01:12.362
Summer, what have you done?!

01:12.430 --> 01:14.492
He wouldn't stop talking to me.

02:13.062 --> 02:15.031
There are so many things
wrong with that picture

02:15.299 --> 02:17.533
that I don't even think I'm offended.

02:17.601 --> 02:19.401
Yeah, what's wrong with it?

02:19.469 --> 02:21.369
I think it's pretty good.

02:21.437 --> 02:23.805
Well, first of all, I'm not a cheerleader.

02:23.873 --> 02:26.207
And second of all, I don't have buckteeth.

02:26.275 --> 02:28.175
And third of all,
I don't walk around saying,

02:28.243 --> 02:30.844
"I'm Ariel, I'm Ariel!"

02:30.912 --> 02:33.680
But other than that,
I think you, uh, you nailed it.

02:33.747 --> 02:35.014
It's a caricature.

02:35.082 --> 02:37.049
It's not supposed to look exactly like you.

02:37.117 --> 02:40.752
It's supposed to tell the truth
about what you're like inside.

02:40.820 --> 02:43.021
And you're right, I think I nailed it.

02:43.090 --> 02:45.392
Good morning, all.

02:47.028 --> 02:49.362
Wow, Bridge, you did all those?

02:49.430 --> 02:51.031
Looks like you've been really busy.

02:51.098 --> 02:52.065
Yep.

02:52.132 --> 02:54.834
Why the sudden interest in art?

02:54.901 --> 02:56.769
Please, Bridgette' not interested in art.

02:56.836 --> 02:59.371
Bridgette is interested in
Finn who is interested in art.

02:59.439 --> 03:00.472
Hey!

03:00.540 --> 03:01.773
Oh, yeah? Who's this Finn?

03:01.841 --> 03:03.374
Bridgette's boyfriend.

03:03.442 --> 03:05.543
He is not. He's not.

03:05.610 --> 03:08.178
He's just a friend that happens to be a boy.

03:08.246 --> 03:09.980
And, uh, it's not the same thing.

03:10.048 --> 03:11.014
Okay.

03:11.082 --> 03:12.549
All right, if you say so.

03:12.616 --> 03:15.217
Does Mom know about this?

03:15.285 --> 03:17.786
Well, I was going to mention
it to her this morning,

03:17.854 --> 03:19.487
but she got up and went to work

03:19.555 --> 03:20.755
before I got up,

03:20.823 --> 03:22.156
so I didn't get to.

03:22.223 --> 03:23.624
Thank you.

03:23.692 --> 03:25.659
Well, I'm here, and I'm all ears.

03:25.727 --> 03:27.961
So tell me a little bit
more about this friend

03:28.029 --> 03:29.730
who happens to be a boy.

03:29.797 --> 03:31.364
He's really nice.

03:31.432 --> 03:33.433
And he sits in front of me in math class.

03:33.500 --> 03:37.736
He's into a lot of the same
really cool stuff that I am.

03:37.803 --> 03:40.138
He's really nice to me, too.

03:40.206 --> 03:43.374
He plays with me and
Bridgette on the playground.

03:43.442 --> 03:45.341
Hmm, okay, I got it.

03:45.409 --> 03:47.375
Finn is cool. Finn is nice.

03:47.443 --> 03:49.677
Come on, dishes into the sink.

03:49.745 --> 03:51.279
We're leaving in five minutes.

03:54.316 --> 03:55.016
See you later.

03:55.084 --> 03:56.584
Okay, see you later.

03:56.652 --> 03:57.652
Later, Pop.

03:57.720 --> 03:59.654
Later.

03:59.722 --> 04:01.522
Morning, Keelin. Morning, Keelin.

04:01.590 --> 04:04.492
Did you sleep well? Did you sleep well?

04:04.559 --> 04:07.329
Do you think maybe this morning
Do you think maybe this morning

04:07.397 --> 04:09.432
you could try to answer
you could try to answer

04:09.500 --> 04:10.867
my questions my questions

04:10.935 --> 04:13.068
instead of repeating them?
instead of repeating them?

04:13.136 --> 04:15.971
Any idea how this girl was able
to break out of this facility?

04:16.039 --> 04:19.175
I mean, I know the name is
Mariposa Psychiatric Hospital,

04:19.243 --> 04:21.209
but it is part of the prison system.

04:21.278 --> 04:22.512
Based on that tape,

04:22.579 --> 04:24.981
that girls doesn't seem terribly aggressive.

04:25.048 --> 04:27.049
To be honest, I'm a little flummoxed.

04:27.117 --> 04:28.484
I think we both are.

04:28.552 --> 04:31.787
Well, obviously, we have a security presence

04:31.855 --> 04:33.089
here at Mariposa Psych,

04:33.156 --> 04:35.024
but in the wing where Keelin resides

04:35.092 --> 04:37.026
it's fairly benign.

04:37.093 --> 04:39.328
Those patients are all
approaching the age of majority.

04:39.396 --> 04:41.330
They're within a year of being released.

04:41.397 --> 04:42.798
So as part of their treatment,

04:42.866 --> 04:44.633
they're afforded much more freedom

04:44.701 --> 04:46.001
than the other wings enjoy.

04:46.069 --> 04:50.038
And the vast majority of
our patients are minors,

04:50.106 --> 04:53.675
so we see very few attempted escapes.

04:53.743 --> 04:56.611
I know that's not much help.

04:56.679 --> 04:58.280
So, uh, who are we looking for?

04:58.348 --> 04:59.983
What can you tell us about her,

05:00.050 --> 05:03.186
other than the fact that she
repeats whatever anybody tells her?

05:03.253 --> 05:06.389
Well, her full name is Keelin McKinney.

05:06.457 --> 05:11.560
And three years ago,
right before her 15th birthday,

05:11.628 --> 05:13.796
she had an affair with her history teacher.

05:13.863 --> 05:16.799
And about five months into it,

05:16.866 --> 05:18.934
the history teacher broke it off.

05:19.002 --> 05:20.635
A week later, she follows him home,

05:20.703 --> 05:22.003
ties him up in his bed

05:22.071 --> 05:24.072
and shoots him 12 times
with her father's pistol.

05:24.139 --> 05:26.874
The police arrive.

05:26.942 --> 05:29.811
She's just sitting there, unresponsive,

05:29.878 --> 05:33.047
and she slipped into a catatonic state.

05:33.115 --> 05:36.183
And, finally, two months ago,
she came out of it.

05:36.251 --> 05:37.518
So that parroting that you saw

05:37.586 --> 05:39.553
on the video-- that's called echolalia.

05:39.621 --> 05:41.355
We almost always encounter it

05:41.423 --> 05:42.857
when catatonic patients awaken.

05:42.924 --> 05:46.127
But having said that,
I've never seen the phenomena

05:46.194 --> 05:48.295
present itself in quite the
way it has with Keelin.

05:48.363 --> 05:51.565
The depth of her recall is extraordinary.

05:51.633 --> 05:54.735
Sometimes she spends whole therapy sessions

05:54.803 --> 05:56.804
parroting the previous session.

05:56.872 --> 05:58.639
Or... she did.

05:58.707 --> 06:00.107
I don't understand.

06:00.175 --> 06:02.910
All she could do was repeat
back what people said to her,

06:02.978 --> 06:05.179
and yet she's within a year of her release?

06:05.247 --> 06:06.780
She was sentenced as a minor.

06:06.848 --> 06:08.582
She's about to turn 18.

06:08.650 --> 06:11.986
And strange as it seems,
the echolalia-- that's progress.

06:12.054 --> 06:13.921
After three years of total silence,

06:13.989 --> 06:16.023
it's Keelin's way of
coming back into the world.

06:16.091 --> 06:19.426
And you have no idea how
she was able to get out?

06:19.494 --> 06:22.830
Maybe she snuck in the
back of a delivery truck.

06:22.898 --> 06:24.064
Hitched a ride out.

06:24.132 --> 06:28.302
Maybe someone left a wrong door open.

06:28.369 --> 06:30.704
None of the orderlies or the guards

06:30.772 --> 06:31.938
are willing to admit

06:32.006 --> 06:34.007
they know anything about what happened.

06:34.075 --> 06:35.675
I think they're afraid for their jobs.

06:35.743 --> 06:37.711
But I'm hoping they'll be more cooperative

06:37.779 --> 06:38.979
when policemen are asking the questions.

06:39.047 --> 06:40.513
I'd be happy to talk to them

06:40.581 --> 06:41.948
and take a look around.

06:42.016 --> 06:44.817
Dr. Woodel, this girl Keelin,
what's your feeling?

06:44.885 --> 06:46.619
Do you think she's dangerous?

06:46.687 --> 06:48.521
I'd like to say no.

06:48.589 --> 06:50.156
That I'm confident that my work with her

06:50.224 --> 06:51.724
has cured her of those impulses,

06:51.792 --> 06:53.626
but I obviously misjudged Keelin.

06:53.694 --> 06:55.161
We all did.

06:55.229 --> 06:59.398
So I can't answer that for sure.

06:59.466 --> 07:01.500
So where do we start?

07:01.568 --> 07:04.169
I thought maybe you could
check out the girl's room

07:04.237 --> 07:05.604
while I walk the grounds.

07:05.672 --> 07:07.706
It's right upstairs, room 306.

07:07.774 --> 07:10.208
Maybe something will come to you, you know?

07:40.471 --> 07:44.206
Ã¢TÂª Ã¢TÂª

07:52.614 --> 07:54.615
He wouldn't stop talking to me.

07:57.218 --> 07:59.620
You here about Keelin?

08:01.288 --> 08:04.456
I can make myself scarce,
if you need some time to look around.

08:04.524 --> 08:06.992
No, no, no, I was just leaving.

08:07.060 --> 08:08.793
I'm Allison; I'm Allison Dubois.

08:08.861 --> 08:10.661
I'm with the District Attorney's Office.

08:10.729 --> 08:12.463
Hi. Summer Lowry.

08:12.531 --> 08:14.065
You folks making any progress?

08:14.133 --> 08:15.900
Have any idea where she is?

08:15.968 --> 08:18.903
No, no, not yet.

08:18.970 --> 08:22.139
Poor Keelin-- she must be terrified.

08:22.207 --> 08:25.275
Why do you say that?

08:25.343 --> 08:27.077
I mean, she did run away.

08:27.145 --> 08:29.413
And the police seem to think
she might be dangerous.

08:29.480 --> 08:30.547
Dangerous?

08:30.615 --> 08:32.215
Keelin?

08:32.283 --> 08:35.018
They haven't met her.

08:35.086 --> 08:37.354
I know what she did and all,

08:37.422 --> 08:39.188
but that was a long time ago.

08:39.256 --> 08:41.024
Keelin was the sweetest person in here.

08:41.092 --> 08:42.359
She was my friend.

08:44.295 --> 08:46.363
Crazy, right?

08:46.431 --> 08:47.931
How can you be friends with someone

08:47.999 --> 08:49.366
who hardly ever talks?

08:49.433 --> 08:53.437
Well, the thought did cross my mind.

08:53.504 --> 08:56.807
We actually talked all the time.

08:56.874 --> 08:58.942
At least, I talked to her.

08:59.010 --> 09:00.744
And she liked it, I could tell.

09:00.812 --> 09:03.280
Believe it or not,

09:03.347 --> 09:06.316
I think it was helping her get better.

09:06.384 --> 09:08.184
And she helped me, too.

09:08.252 --> 09:11.488
Don't tell Dr. Woodel, but, you know,

09:11.555 --> 09:14.858
sometimes I liked talking to Keelin
more than I like talking to him.

09:14.925 --> 09:16.326
Yeah?

09:16.393 --> 09:18.228
Summer, it's time for group.

09:18.295 --> 09:20.463
Well, I have to go.

09:20.531 --> 09:22.031
But look at whatever you'd like.

09:22.099 --> 09:23.299
It was nice meeting you.

09:23.367 --> 09:25.802
Yeah. Nice to meet you, Summer.

09:25.869 --> 09:28.104
Well, I don't know what kind of work

09:28.172 --> 09:29.739
you're doing around here,

09:29.807 --> 09:32.742
but it certainly seems
to be working for her.

09:32.809 --> 09:35.411
Yeah, Summer's definitely come a long way.

09:35.479 --> 09:38.047
Her parents must be so relieved.

09:38.115 --> 09:39.782
Oh, you don't know?

09:41.318 --> 09:45.020
Summer's parents are the
reason that she's here.

09:45.088 --> 09:47.156
When she was 13, right about the time

09:47.223 --> 09:49.658
they began to suspect that she was ill,

09:49.726 --> 09:51.727
Summer snuck into their room
while they were sleeping

09:51.794 --> 09:53.428
and she stabbed them to death.

09:53.496 --> 09:55.597
<i>Bridgette Dubois!</i>

09:55.665 --> 09:59.601
Bridgette Dubois,
do you have an answer for me?

09:59.669 --> 10:02.137
Bridgette?

10:02.204 --> 10:04.072
I'm waiting.

10:04.140 --> 10:07.942
Okay...

10:08.010 --> 10:10.178
Okay, what?

10:10.245 --> 10:13.514
I see you furiously
scribbling in your notebook.

10:13.582 --> 10:15.850
I can only assume you figured out what X is.

10:17.719 --> 10:20.488
Um, let me see.

10:22.958 --> 10:25.927
Any time now, Bridgette.

10:34.903 --> 10:36.170
Three?

10:36.238 --> 10:38.405
Very good, Bridgette.

10:38.473 --> 10:41.842
I'm glad to see you were paying attention.

10:43.978 --> 10:45.612
Thank you.

10:47.882 --> 10:49.516
Thanks. I owe you one.

10:49.584 --> 10:50.817
Yeah, it's okay.

10:50.885 --> 10:52.752
I just hope you were spaced out

10:52.820 --> 10:54.386
'cause you were working on another cartoon.

10:54.454 --> 10:56.188
Mr. Marcotullio this time.

10:56.255 --> 10:57.989
I think I nailed him.

11:05.263 --> 11:07.130
Aren't you going to let me see it?

11:07.198 --> 11:08.998
Nope.

11:09.066 --> 11:11.133
Not good enough. It's not ready.

11:11.201 --> 11:12.968
It's okay.

11:13.036 --> 11:14.970
Show it to me when you're ready.

11:15.038 --> 11:16.305
If I survive gym class,

11:16.373 --> 11:17.940
I'll see you and Marie at lunch, okay?

11:18.007 --> 11:19.174
Yeah, sure.

11:19.242 --> 11:20.542
See you then.

11:26.114 --> 11:27.514
Okay. Okay.

11:27.582 --> 11:29.950
Keelin, I'd like to change the subject.

11:30.018 --> 11:32.819
Let's talk about your parents.

11:32.887 --> 11:34.821
Do you ever think about your childhood?

11:34.889 --> 11:36.589
Your relationship with your mom and dad?

11:36.657 --> 11:40.560
Your relationship with your mom and dad?

11:40.628 --> 11:43.930
This is that girl-- Keelin McKinney--

11:43.998 --> 11:46.732
the one who went missing from
Mariposa Psych last night.

11:46.800 --> 11:49.135
Yeah, I have to say I'm impressed.

11:49.203 --> 11:53.906
If that girl recovered enough to run
away from a psychiatric hospital,

11:53.974 --> 11:55.541
her doctor's a miracle worker.

11:55.609 --> 11:58.143
You know, I met another
one of his patients today.

11:58.211 --> 11:59.812
A girl named Summer.

11:59.879 --> 12:01.814
She murdered her parents six years ago.

12:01.881 --> 12:03.715
You wouldn't believe how far she's come.

12:03.783 --> 12:05.617
I mean, she seems like she could have been

12:05.685 --> 12:06.785
one of Ariel's friends.

12:06.853 --> 12:09.588
But here's the thing that I don't get:

12:09.655 --> 12:11.890
She killed her parents.

12:11.958 --> 12:14.526
She slaughtered them in their beds.

12:14.594 --> 12:18.029
The memory of that's got to be
in there somewhere, doesn't it?

12:18.097 --> 12:20.432
How can she live with that?

12:20.499 --> 12:22.400
How could she function?

12:22.468 --> 12:24.269
Don't look at me, I have no idea.

12:24.337 --> 12:26.104
I can barely function myself,

12:26.172 --> 12:29.808
and I haven't slaughtered anybody.

12:29.875 --> 12:31.676
Not lately.

12:46.123 --> 12:49.125
Sweetie, what are you doing here?

13:17.217 --> 13:19.284
911. What's the nature of your emergency?

13:19.352 --> 13:22.653
I need the police right
away and an ambulance!

13:22.721 --> 13:24.288
I think they're dead!

13:24.356 --> 13:26.290
Oh, my God, I think she killed them!

13:26.358 --> 13:27.658
Sir, please calm down.

13:27.725 --> 13:29.059
We'll get a car right out to you.

13:29.127 --> 13:30.361
Who is dead?

13:30.428 --> 13:32.229
My-my parents.

13:32.297 --> 13:35.366
She killed them. She finally snapped.

13:35.434 --> 13:38.703
My sister went crazy and killed my parents!

13:47.977 --> 13:50.111
Oh, that's pretty.

13:50.179 --> 13:52.179
I love impatiens.

13:52.247 --> 13:53.580
Thanks.

13:53.648 --> 13:55.882
They've been letting me
take care of the garden

13:55.950 --> 13:57.717
for a few years now.

13:57.785 --> 14:00.219
You're here with Keelin news, right?

14:00.287 --> 14:03.122
Good news, right?

14:03.190 --> 14:06.558
No news, I'm sorry to say.

14:06.626 --> 14:10.595
Actually, I was wanting to talk
to you about something else.

14:10.662 --> 14:13.530
I know why you're here.

14:13.598 --> 14:15.198
I know what happened.

14:16.233 --> 14:18.333
I'm curious.

14:18.401 --> 14:21.702
How much do you actually
remember from that night?

14:21.770 --> 14:25.572
I remember everything.

14:25.639 --> 14:27.707
And I wish I didn't.

14:30.143 --> 14:33.878
Honestly, I don't really
like to think about it

14:33.945 --> 14:35.413
that much, Mrs. Dubois.

14:35.480 --> 14:39.553
I was a very different person back then.

14:39.621 --> 14:42.657
I was very confused.

14:42.725 --> 14:47.800
I had convinced myself that
my parents were imposters.

14:47.867 --> 14:50.302
That evil people had replaced them

14:50.370 --> 14:52.905
and were trying to do bad
things to me and my brother.

14:52.972 --> 14:56.074
Actually, I wanted to talk
to you about your brother.

14:56.142 --> 14:57.809
What about him?

14:57.877 --> 14:59.278
Well, it's like you said--

14:59.345 --> 15:04.216
you were a very different person then.

15:04.284 --> 15:06.652
You were confused.

15:06.719 --> 15:09.721
I'm just wondering if you could think back,

15:09.789 --> 15:11.757
think back.

15:11.824 --> 15:15.026
Do you remember actually
seeing your brother that night?

15:17.163 --> 15:19.964
Where are you going with this?

15:22.268 --> 15:25.837
Do you know how long I've been here?

15:25.905 --> 15:28.706
Do you know how hard I've worked

15:28.774 --> 15:31.475
to get to the place where I am?

15:31.542 --> 15:34.311
I mean, how crazy do you think I am?

15:36.146 --> 15:38.680
The night you're talking about,

15:38.748 --> 15:42.216
has been cauterized in my memory.

15:42.284 --> 15:45.455
And you're implying that
the only living relative

15:45.523 --> 15:48.826
that I have left may have been a part of it?

15:48.894 --> 15:52.396
And that maybe I don't remember?

15:54.733 --> 15:57.868
Mrs. Dubois, on your way out today

15:57.936 --> 16:00.804
you might seriously consider
trading in your visitor's badge

16:00.872 --> 16:03.073
for a room assignment.

16:16.186 --> 16:17.687
Did you see Marie?

16:17.754 --> 16:19.121
She's out there somewhere.

16:19.189 --> 16:21.356
She'll be along in a minute.

16:21.424 --> 16:23.258
Hey, can I ask you a question?

16:23.326 --> 16:24.492
You just did.

16:24.560 --> 16:26.127
Never mind.

16:26.195 --> 16:27.528
Okay, I'm sorry.

16:27.596 --> 16:29.797
What?

16:29.865 --> 16:33.702
When you like a guy, how do you know it?

16:35.338 --> 16:37.172
Wait-- who likes a boy?

16:37.240 --> 16:39.174
I'm thinking maybe I do.

16:39.242 --> 16:41.410
You know, it's sixth grade.

16:41.478 --> 16:43.679
Boys just can't be friends
with girls anymore,

16:43.747 --> 16:45.982
and girls just can't be friends with boys.

16:46.049 --> 16:48.951
And everyone's starting
to like someone, like--

16:49.019 --> 16:50.486
"like," like.

16:50.553 --> 16:52.220
It's weird.

16:52.288 --> 16:56.091
I didn't think I was into any
of this stuff, but then...

16:56.159 --> 16:58.727
I drew this.

17:06.237 --> 17:08.471
Wow.

17:08.539 --> 17:12.342
I, um... I guess you might
really like this guy.

17:12.410 --> 17:13.978
Really?

17:14.045 --> 17:16.213
'Cause I don't feel any different.

17:16.281 --> 17:18.883
And the weirdest thing is,

17:18.950 --> 17:20.684
I don't even remember writing it down.

17:20.752 --> 17:24.355
I mean, I just looked down and there it was.

17:24.422 --> 17:28.925
Yeah, liking guys can make us
do some really strange stuff.

17:28.993 --> 17:32.296
So how do I make it stop?

17:32.364 --> 17:35.766
You like this guy.

17:35.834 --> 17:38.202
And you can't turn that off.

17:38.270 --> 17:40.838
So maybe you should try
hanging out with him.

17:40.906 --> 17:43.107
See if maybe he feels the same way.

17:43.175 --> 17:44.275
Well, what do you mean?

17:44.343 --> 17:45.977
I'm already hanging out with him.

17:46.045 --> 17:51.449
I know, but now that you like him,
it's gonna be different.

17:51.517 --> 17:52.917
Different how?

17:57.188 --> 17:59.690
I can't explain.

17:59.758 --> 18:02.226
But it's um, it's gonna be different.

18:02.294 --> 18:04.795
So I have to keep doing
what I'm already doing,

18:04.863 --> 18:05.896
except now it's different

18:05.964 --> 18:08.098
in some way that you can't explain to me?

18:08.166 --> 18:10.634
Yeah.

18:10.702 --> 18:14.905
I'm never going to get rid of this, am I?

18:14.972 --> 18:17.006
Of course I remember Summer Lowry.

18:17.074 --> 18:21.076
I handled the plea bargain
that led to her committal.

18:21.144 --> 18:24.379
And I was present when she confessed

18:24.446 --> 18:25.813
to the killing of her parents.

18:25.881 --> 18:29.183
Look...

18:29.250 --> 18:31.485
you and I have far too much history together

18:31.553 --> 18:33.653
for me to just dismiss out of hand

18:33.721 --> 18:35.888
something you've dreamt,
but there is precious little

18:35.956 --> 18:38.591
to suggest that anybody got anything wrong

18:38.658 --> 18:39.792
in this particular case.

18:39.860 --> 18:41.427
At the time of her committal,

18:41.494 --> 18:44.330
Summer Lowry was a deeply
disturbed young woman.

18:44.397 --> 18:46.465
And she had a very well documented history

18:46.533 --> 18:48.133
of violent behavior.

18:48.201 --> 18:50.102
And she confessed to the crime.

18:50.170 --> 18:51.703
Her brother Chad, on the other hand,

18:51.771 --> 18:54.039
was anonor student, he was grief stricken,

18:54.107 --> 18:56.675
and no one who knew him,
even for just a minute,

18:56.742 --> 18:57.742
entertained the idea

18:57.810 --> 18:59.144
that he might have been involved.

18:59.211 --> 19:01.646
Well, I know it sounds
like it's from left field,

19:01.714 --> 19:04.282
but there was nothing
vague about what I saw.

19:04.350 --> 19:06.685
It was completely unambiguous.

19:06.753 --> 19:09.654
He committed the killings,
and she was nowhere in sight.

19:09.722 --> 19:11.356
Be that as it may,

19:11.424 --> 19:13.859
unless you have some evidence
that you haven't shown me yet--

19:13.927 --> 19:16.796
something to prove that
what you've seen is true--

19:16.863 --> 19:20.066
there's nothing I can do, Allison.

19:23.237 --> 19:24.604
Hello.

19:24.672 --> 19:26.673
You want some good news or bad news?

19:26.740 --> 19:27.840
Lee...

19:27.908 --> 19:29.642
Good or bad, you gotta call it.

19:29.710 --> 19:31.611
All right, good, give me the good.

19:31.678 --> 19:33.012
And you better not disappoint.

19:33.080 --> 19:35.081
You know that girl who
escaped from Mariposa Psych,

19:35.148 --> 19:36.482
Keelin McKinney?

19:36.550 --> 19:38.216
I'm hot on her trail.

19:38.284 --> 19:40.617
Turns out she paid a visit
to her shrink last night.

19:40.684 --> 19:42.483
You're right, that is excellent news.

19:42.551 --> 19:44.917
But what's the bad?

19:44.985 --> 19:48.517
Dr. Woodel left the windows
in his house unlocked.

19:48.584 --> 19:50.151
We think that's how she got in.

19:50.219 --> 19:52.086
The housekeeper found him around noon.

19:52.153 --> 19:54.587
He was lying in bed,
his wrists tied to the headboard

19:54.655 --> 19:58.156
stabbed to death with a
knife from his own kitchen.

19:58.224 --> 19:59.523
The whole scene was littered

19:59.591 --> 20:01.091
with Keelin's hair and fingerprints.

20:01.159 --> 20:03.460
I just don't understand.

20:03.527 --> 20:05.395
Why would she kill her therapist?

20:05.462 --> 20:08.631
Well, we're talking about
an escaped mental patient.

20:08.699 --> 20:12.234
This girl was committed
because she got obsessed

20:12.302 --> 20:14.269
with her teacher, before she killed him.

20:14.337 --> 20:16.837
Maybe she got obsessed with this guy, too.

20:16.905 --> 20:20.073
Anyway, we know who did it.

20:20.141 --> 20:22.342
Now we just have to find her.

20:22.409 --> 20:24.343
Girls, come on,
what are you doing back there?

20:24.411 --> 20:25.478
Dinner's ready.

20:25.545 --> 20:28.080
Wow!

20:28.148 --> 20:29.248
Wow, look at you.

20:29.316 --> 20:30.616
You look so pretty.

20:30.684 --> 20:31.918
What is this all about?

20:31.985 --> 20:33.385
We're giving my face a test run.

20:33.453 --> 20:34.653
I'm going over to Finn's house

20:34.721 --> 20:36.021
on Saturday, to watch a movie.

20:36.089 --> 20:38.456
Well, I think the test is going quite well.

20:38.524 --> 20:39.724
Thanks.

20:39.792 --> 20:42.659
How about some dinner?

20:46.664 --> 20:48.198
Makeup?

20:48.266 --> 20:50.868
Bridgette is wearing makeup?

20:50.935 --> 20:52.536
Our Bridgette?

20:52.604 --> 20:53.905
Help me out here.

20:53.972 --> 20:55.573
Wasn't she just born?

20:55.641 --> 20:58.042
Didn't we just bring her
home from the hospital?

20:58.109 --> 20:59.576
I'm sorry, Daddy.

20:59.644 --> 21:01.778
Your little girl likes a little boy.

21:01.846 --> 21:04.247
I know she can't spend her whole life

21:04.314 --> 21:07.149
as a conscientious objector
in the war between the sexes,

21:07.217 --> 21:10.351
but doesn't this seem-- I don't know, fast?

21:12.955 --> 21:14.822
This doesn't alarm you?

21:14.890 --> 21:17.625
Our middle daughter-- boys?

21:17.693 --> 21:19.360
Hey, I'm a reformed boy myself.

21:19.427 --> 21:20.661
And let me tell you something--

21:20.729 --> 21:22.497
if you're not worried, you ought to be.

21:22.564 --> 21:25.934
Come on, it's cute.

21:26.001 --> 21:28.603
Besides, there's nothing we can do about it.

21:28.670 --> 21:30.704
And there's nothing reformed about you.

21:36.676 --> 21:38.243
No, please. Why are you doing this?

21:38.311 --> 21:40.279
Doctor, come on,
I think we both know damn well

21:40.346 --> 21:41.280
why I'm doing this.

21:41.347 --> 21:42.480
No, I don't.

21:42.548 --> 21:45.116
You can just let me go. Untie me, walk away.

21:45.184 --> 21:47.018
Please, I won't tell anybody what I know.

21:47.086 --> 21:49.787
I certainly won't tell them
that you killed your parents.

21:49.855 --> 21:51.623
Of course you'd say that now,

21:51.691 --> 21:53.125
but you weren't exactly reassuring

21:53.192 --> 21:55.394
when you came to see me a few weeks ago.

21:55.462 --> 21:57.830
Back then it was, "Give me
half of everything you've got

21:57.898 --> 22:00.333
or I'm going to the police."

22:00.400 --> 22:03.336
You even got that tape with
her talking about it all.

22:04.971 --> 22:07.841
But I don't want any more money, now, Chad.

22:07.908 --> 22:09.376
I'll give you those tapes.

22:09.444 --> 22:11.211
No one will ever know better.

22:11.279 --> 22:13.180
You're right about that much.

22:13.247 --> 22:14.381
Stop.

22:14.449 --> 22:16.717
You can't just kill me.

22:16.785 --> 22:18.653
Think it through, Chad.

22:18.720 --> 22:20.254
They'll catch you.

22:20.322 --> 22:23.257
You don't have some poor sick
girl to pin it on this time.

22:23.324 --> 22:25.726
Actually, I do.

22:25.793 --> 22:27.561
But this time her name isn't Summer...

22:29.663 --> 22:31.931
...it's Keelin.

22:31.999 --> 22:35.500
You are going to tell me
where those tapes are,

22:35.568 --> 22:38.369
in which case, Keelin's going
to kill you nice and quick,

22:38.437 --> 22:40.805
or you're going to put up a fight,

22:40.873 --> 22:43.507
which means Keelin's going to take her time.

22:50.158 --> 22:52.159
Now the brother didn't
just kill the parents,

22:52.227 --> 22:54.228
he's killed this girl Keelin McKinney

22:54.295 --> 22:56.263
and he killed Keelin
McKinney's psychiatrist?

22:56.331 --> 22:58.232
Well, think about it. He had to.

22:58.299 --> 23:01.135
Dr. Woodel knew that
Chad was the real killer.

23:01.202 --> 23:03.003
And he was in the process
of blackmailing Chad.

23:03.071 --> 23:05.839
I'm sorry.

23:05.906 --> 23:08.474
Okay, all right, let's assume

23:08.542 --> 23:11.410
that you are correct about all of this.

23:11.478 --> 23:13.145
The blackmail, everything.

23:13.213 --> 23:15.616
That Summer confessed the
truth to her psychiatrist

23:15.684 --> 23:17.552
and he used it to blackmail the brother.

23:17.620 --> 23:19.888
How in the hell did Chad
Lowry come into possession

23:19.955 --> 23:21.456
of Keelin McKinney's hand?

23:22.524 --> 23:25.092
I know, I know,

23:25.160 --> 23:27.994
he sawed it off her arm after he killed her.

23:30.764 --> 23:33.065
There's an APB out on this girl.

23:33.133 --> 23:35.334
Every policeman in the
city is looking for her.

23:35.401 --> 23:36.935
Do you seriously think that Chad Lowry

23:37.002 --> 23:38.536
tracked her down before the police could?

23:38.604 --> 23:40.604
What if he didn't have to track her down?

23:40.672 --> 23:42.205
What if she came to him?

23:42.273 --> 23:44.674
I mean, he visits his sister
every week in the hospital.

23:44.742 --> 23:46.442
They probably know each other.

23:46.509 --> 23:48.143
What if she came to him for help?

23:48.211 --> 23:52.846
I don't know what to tell you, Allison.

23:52.914 --> 23:55.181
The Lowry murder is a closed case.

23:55.249 --> 23:56.416
The murderer confessed,

23:56.483 --> 23:58.550
and even she doesn't dispute what happened.

23:58.618 --> 24:00.152
The killing of the psychiatrist

24:00.219 --> 24:01.753
seems pretty open and shut, as well.

24:01.820 --> 24:04.221
I would love to show you
some support in all of this,

24:04.289 --> 24:07.758
but if the guilty party
insists they're guilty...

24:07.826 --> 24:08.893
That's okay.

24:08.960 --> 24:10.963
You know what, I know what I have to do.

24:11.031 --> 24:12.800
I have to go back to Mariposa Psych.

24:12.867 --> 24:15.036
Summer Lowry knows what happened
the night her parents died.

24:15.104 --> 24:17.539
She obviously told her psychiatrist.

24:17.607 --> 24:19.841
She can tell me, too.

24:23.512 --> 24:27.148
Summer, It's Allison.

24:29.952 --> 24:31.953
Summer, I know you're in there.

24:32.020 --> 24:34.955
The front desk called you and
let you know I was coming.

24:35.023 --> 24:36.790
Please open the door.

24:38.526 --> 24:41.295
Summer, I'm coming in.

24:48.068 --> 24:50.569
I know you're upset.

24:50.637 --> 24:53.105
We're all upset.

24:53.173 --> 24:55.174
And obviously, I didn't know Dr. Woodel

24:55.242 --> 24:56.876
as well as you did, but...

24:56.943 --> 25:00.145
They said that Keelin did it.

25:00.213 --> 25:02.581
I can't believe that.

25:02.649 --> 25:05.117
Do you believe that?

25:07.621 --> 25:10.457
I-I know she killed that other man, but...

25:10.524 --> 25:12.358
I'll tell you what I think.

25:12.426 --> 25:14.594
I will tell you exactly what I think.

25:14.661 --> 25:17.931
But first, Summer,
you have to be honest with me.

25:17.998 --> 25:21.200
You have to tell me what you know.

25:21.267 --> 25:23.668
What are you talking about?

25:23.736 --> 25:25.671
You know what I'm talking about.

25:25.739 --> 25:28.106
I think the same person
who killed Dr. Woodel

25:28.174 --> 25:29.407
killed your parents.

25:29.475 --> 25:33.311
But that doesn't make any sense.

25:33.379 --> 25:35.882
That makes perfect sense.

25:35.949 --> 25:40.553
What makes no sense is you protecting him.

25:40.621 --> 25:43.390
I mean, I know he's your brother,

25:43.458 --> 25:44.891
but what is it?

25:44.959 --> 25:46.393
Is he threatening you?

25:49.063 --> 25:51.297
Summer--

25:51.365 --> 25:54.633
I think he killed Keelin, too.

25:56.369 --> 25:58.603
No.

25:58.671 --> 26:01.473
He's doing the same thing to her

26:01.540 --> 26:02.741
that he did to you--

26:02.808 --> 26:04.209
trying to get everyone to believe

26:04.276 --> 26:06.745
that she's a murderer.

26:08.648 --> 26:12.017
You said she was your friend.

26:12.084 --> 26:14.786
Don't you think you should
come forward for her?

26:17.155 --> 26:19.123
If it's your safety you're worried about,

26:19.190 --> 26:20.991
we can, we can protect you.

26:21.058 --> 26:23.160
I can't.

26:24.162 --> 26:25.228
I can't.

26:25.296 --> 26:27.230
Yes, you can. Just tell me you will.

26:27.298 --> 26:31.300
I can't! I can't!

26:33.803 --> 26:35.837
Okay.

26:35.905 --> 26:38.140
Okay, okay.

26:38.207 --> 26:40.442
Just-just think about what I said.

26:40.510 --> 26:42.711
And I'll call you on the phone

26:42.779 --> 26:45.580
and we can talk about it tonight, okay?

26:52.555 --> 26:53.755
Can I come in?

26:53.823 --> 26:54.890
Go away. I'm busy.

26:54.957 --> 26:57.259
I need you to look at something.

26:57.326 --> 26:59.260
I told you I'm busy.

26:59.328 --> 27:02.063
Look at these two books.

27:02.131 --> 27:03.765
Okay, I'm looking.

27:03.833 --> 27:05.567
So what am I supposed to see?

27:05.635 --> 27:07.635
You remember that, right?

27:07.703 --> 27:09.270
Yes.

27:09.338 --> 27:11.239
Okay, now look at this.

27:11.307 --> 27:13.108
Okay.

27:16.279 --> 27:19.215
You filled another notebook.

27:19.282 --> 27:21.183
You should be careful.

27:21.250 --> 27:22.584
Finn might think you're a stalker.

27:22.652 --> 27:25.287
That's not my notebook, that's Marie's.

27:25.355 --> 27:28.223
And she's got this book
filled with this stuff.

27:28.291 --> 27:29.858
Pages and pages.

27:29.926 --> 27:32.060
And I think she's been doing it a while.

27:32.128 --> 27:35.230
So what's your point?

27:35.298 --> 27:37.999
My point is, I think that the reason

27:38.067 --> 27:41.569
that I don't remember doing it,
is because I didn't do it.

27:41.637 --> 27:43.772
I think this page belongs to Marie

27:43.839 --> 27:46.674
and somehow ended up in my book.

27:46.742 --> 27:50.979
I think she's the one who's
in love with Finn-- not me.

27:51.046 --> 27:54.515
Wait a minute, Bridge,

27:54.583 --> 27:57.618
just because you didn't write his name
a hundred times on a piece of paper,

27:57.686 --> 27:59.820
does not mean that you don't like him.

28:02.457 --> 28:05.960
Hey, say something. You're scaring me.

28:06.027 --> 28:07.995
I don't know what to say, okay?

28:08.063 --> 28:09.163
I'm just upset.

28:09.231 --> 28:11.232
What are you upset about?

28:11.299 --> 28:14.902
I mean, first you tell me that you don't
like the way it feels to like a boy,

28:14.970 --> 28:17.938
and then when it turns out that maybe
you don't like him you get upset.

28:18.006 --> 28:19.206
So, Bridgette, make up your mind.

28:19.274 --> 28:21.709
I did make up my mind.

28:21.776 --> 28:23.444
And I know what I said.

28:23.511 --> 28:27.514
: I know that I said that
liking a boy felt weird.

28:27.582 --> 28:33.019
Then it started to make me feel,
I don't know, normal for once.

28:33.087 --> 28:39.259
Bridgette, well,
then-then maybe you do like him.

28:40.294 --> 28:43.096
No.

28:43.163 --> 28:45.732
This is Marie's, not mine.

28:45.799 --> 28:47.667
Finn's not mine either.

28:51.205 --> 28:53.472
What do you mean she won't speak with me?

28:53.540 --> 28:55.508
I was there today.

28:55.576 --> 28:58.444
We had a plan to speak tonight.

29:00.347 --> 29:02.515
Are you sure you have the right patient--

29:02.582 --> 29:04.383
Summer Lowry?

29:04.451 --> 29:05.684
My name is Dubois.

29:05.752 --> 29:08.687
Allison Dubois.

29:08.755 --> 29:10.089
But can you just check again?

29:10.157 --> 29:11.190
It's really important.

29:11.258 --> 29:12.358
Hey.

29:12.426 --> 29:13.693
Hey. Yeah?

29:13.761 --> 29:15.095
She won't speak with me.

29:15.163 --> 29:16.697
They said she won't take my call.

29:21.336 --> 29:23.571
No, I understand.

29:23.639 --> 29:25.940
Um... can you just do me a favor?

29:26.008 --> 29:27.709
Make sure she's got my number

29:27.777 --> 29:29.611
and let her know if she changes her mind,

29:29.679 --> 29:32.581
that I'll be here and I would
love to speak with her.

29:35.752 --> 29:37.119
Thanks.

29:39.923 --> 29:43.626
They said you needed to see me right away.

29:43.694 --> 29:45.095
So what do you want, Summer.

29:45.162 --> 29:47.230
I usually don't get up
for another few hours.

29:47.298 --> 29:48.732
I hope this is important.

29:48.800 --> 29:51.665
I like this time of day.

29:51.733 --> 29:53.333
Just before the sun gets too bright.

29:53.401 --> 29:54.999
What do you want?

29:56.633 --> 29:59.700
I'm done covering up for you.

29:59.768 --> 30:01.633
What are you talking about?

30:01.701 --> 30:03.568
I've been so stupid.

30:03.636 --> 30:06.137
Keeping your secret for so long.

30:06.205 --> 30:08.139
I'm getting better, you know.

30:08.206 --> 30:09.373
Stronger.

30:09.441 --> 30:11.141
I'm finally ready to stand up to you.

30:11.209 --> 30:12.709
To do what has to be done.

30:12.777 --> 30:14.244
Shut up. You are making a scene.

30:14.311 --> 30:16.646
You shouldn't have hurt Keelin.
She was my friend.

30:21.484 --> 30:22.917
Oh, God...

30:22.985 --> 30:25.052
Hey, you're up.

30:25.120 --> 30:28.122
I was letting you sleep,
but Scanlon's on the phone.

30:28.189 --> 30:29.723
He says it's urgent.

30:30.525 --> 30:31.725
Hello?

30:31.792 --> 30:33.293
Allison, sorry to bother you on a Saturday,

30:33.360 --> 30:35.561
but I think you might want to come meet me

30:35.629 --> 30:36.562
out at Mariposa Psych.

30:36.630 --> 30:37.830
Oh, no, no, no.

30:37.897 --> 30:39.731
Summer Lowry's brother came to visit her

30:39.799 --> 30:41.333
first thing this morning.

30:41.400 --> 30:43.534
She attacked him with a gardening spade.

30:43.602 --> 30:46.537
Stabbed him three times before
the orderlies pulled her off.

30:46.605 --> 30:48.272
Chad Lowry's dead.

30:54.078 --> 30:55.411
Oh, Summer.

30:57.414 --> 30:59.948
The guy from the M.E.
's Office said it looked like

31:00.016 --> 31:01.516
she'd been sharpening her spade on concrete.

31:01.584 --> 31:03.018
Oh...

31:03.285 --> 31:05.653
It looks like she knew exactly
what she was going to do

31:05.721 --> 31:07.255
when her brother got here this morning.

31:07.322 --> 31:08.656
Where is she?

31:08.724 --> 31:10.458
They have her in isolation.

31:10.525 --> 31:12.059
She's restrained.

31:12.127 --> 31:13.895
Apparently, she's been hysterical ever since

31:13.962 --> 31:15.629
they dragged her off her brother.

31:15.697 --> 31:18.866
I just finished talking with
the director of the hospital.

31:18.934 --> 31:21.268
Obviously Summer hasn't
made as much progress

31:21.336 --> 31:22.569
as everyone thought.

31:22.637 --> 31:25.105
But they... they finally calmed her down

31:25.173 --> 31:27.775
and she's starting to talk.

31:27.842 --> 31:30.544
Allison, did you tell that girl

31:30.612 --> 31:32.746
that you thought her brother
killed Keelin McKinney?

31:32.814 --> 31:34.848
I did.

31:34.916 --> 31:36.750
I did.

31:36.817 --> 31:39.419
But I saw him do it, sir.

31:39.486 --> 31:41.754
I-I just wanted to talk to her

31:41.822 --> 31:43.289
about what happened with her parents,

31:43.357 --> 31:45.557
so she could clear her name.

31:45.625 --> 31:48.227
I-I was just trying to help.

31:59.173 --> 32:00.474
It's after 10:00.

32:00.541 --> 32:02.209
You getting up today or what?

32:02.276 --> 32:04.043
It's Saturday.

32:04.111 --> 32:05.411
Leave me alone.

32:05.479 --> 32:06.546
Nope.

32:06.614 --> 32:08.381
Stop sulking. Get up.

32:08.449 --> 32:10.684
You need to see something.

32:12.419 --> 32:15.921
You left these in my room yesterday.

32:15.989 --> 32:18.857
And there is something
in here you should see.

32:18.925 --> 32:20.091
What are you talking about?

32:20.158 --> 32:21.625
That's my notebook.

32:21.692 --> 32:24.193
What could be in that,
that I don't already know about?

32:24.261 --> 32:26.529
You recognize this?

32:29.566 --> 32:31.499
It's Finn.

32:31.567 --> 32:33.535
Isn't it?

32:33.602 --> 32:35.169
And you drew it?

32:35.237 --> 32:36.870
Yeah. So?

32:36.938 --> 32:39.205
So it's good.

32:39.273 --> 32:41.674
And Marie didn't draw it, you did.

32:41.742 --> 32:44.110
Okay, tell me something I don't know.

32:44.177 --> 32:47.512
Bridgette, there's...
at least ten drawings like that.

32:47.580 --> 32:49.047
All of Finn,

32:49.115 --> 32:51.782
and he's the only thing
I've seen you try to draw

32:51.850 --> 32:53.851
without an extra eye or giant buckteeth.

32:53.918 --> 32:56.687
You draw him well.

32:56.754 --> 32:58.822
You take time.

32:58.889 --> 33:02.025
You take care.

33:02.093 --> 33:03.927
And you look at those drawings,

33:03.995 --> 33:05.862
and you sense that they're
filled with feeling.

33:05.930 --> 33:07.230
Really?

33:07.298 --> 33:10.667
Trust me, you like Finn.

33:10.735 --> 33:14.671
You, just you.

33:14.739 --> 33:16.772
Welcome aboard.

33:21.847 --> 33:25.416
No fair. You can't stay out here all night.

33:30.889 --> 33:33.591
All I've heard for the last three hours

33:33.659 --> 33:35.727
is how great Finn Milner is.

33:35.795 --> 33:37.663
Did you know that he can draw and paint,

33:37.731 --> 33:39.098
and skateboard and hold
his breath underwater

33:39.166 --> 33:40.567
for almost two whole minutes?

33:42.238 --> 33:45.440
Please, I'm in serious need
of some adult conversation.

33:45.508 --> 33:48.911
I'm sorry, I don't want to talk tonight.

33:48.979 --> 33:51.849
I ruined a girl's life today, Joe.

33:51.917 --> 33:54.618
I wanted to help her.

33:54.686 --> 33:57.823
I wanted to convince the world
that she wasn't a killer.

33:57.891 --> 34:00.125
And all I did was convince
her to become one.

34:00.193 --> 34:02.261
Become a killer?

34:02.329 --> 34:03.863
Did you use those exact words?

34:03.931 --> 34:06.833
All I cared about was solving the case.

34:06.901 --> 34:09.503
All I cared about was proving

34:09.571 --> 34:12.273
that Chad Lowry was the real murderer.

34:12.340 --> 34:16.077
I didn't stop to think
whether getting to the truth

34:16.145 --> 34:18.679
was the right thing for Summer.

34:18.748 --> 34:20.550
I pressed her.

34:20.618 --> 34:23.020
She wasn't ready.

34:23.088 --> 34:26.290
Chad Lowry is dead because of me.

34:26.358 --> 34:29.260
The man was a killer, Allison.

34:29.328 --> 34:33.465
Yeah, well, now his little sister is, too.

34:33.532 --> 34:35.300
So I'd like to try something
new today, Keelin.

34:35.367 --> 34:37.235
So I'd like to try something
new today, Keelin.

34:37.303 --> 34:38.469
It's good to hear your voice.

34:38.538 --> 34:39.971
It's always good to hear your voice.

34:40.039 --> 34:42.273
But I want to hear what you have to say,

34:42.341 --> 34:44.609
so I'm just going to stop talking

34:44.676 --> 34:46.643
and just listen.

34:46.712 --> 34:47.879
Hear what comes out.

34:47.947 --> 34:50.581
Hear what comes out.

34:54.221 --> 34:56.322
You know what?

34:56.389 --> 34:59.090
I really like you, Keelin.

34:59.158 --> 35:02.660
You are such a good listener.

35:02.728 --> 35:05.896
Even combing your hair is nice.

35:08.499 --> 35:11.267
It's like sharing a room with a doll.

35:11.335 --> 35:13.169
A doll that breathes.

35:14.939 --> 35:19.074
Oh, with everybody else I have to act.

35:19.142 --> 35:21.042
I know a lot of people say that,

35:21.110 --> 35:23.611
but with me, it's true.

35:23.678 --> 35:26.079
Really true.

35:26.146 --> 35:29.515
And I get so tired of it sometimes.

35:29.582 --> 35:33.784
It takes a lot out of yo
u- acting all the time.

35:36.588 --> 35:38.755
I had to do so much work

35:38.823 --> 35:41.892
to figure out how to pretend to be sick.

35:41.960 --> 35:44.728
I had to pretend that I
belong in a place like this,

35:44.796 --> 35:47.264
and I did not think that
people would believe me,

35:47.331 --> 35:49.165
but everyone did.

35:51.134 --> 35:53.801
My parents--

35:53.869 --> 35:56.804
they used to cry.

35:56.872 --> 35:58.372
And they would say,

35:58.440 --> 36:02.843
"Summer, we don't understand
what's wrong with you."

36:02.910 --> 36:04.578
Keelin, is this something
Summer said to you?

36:04.645 --> 36:07.480
Keelin, is this something
Summer said to you?

36:09.749 --> 36:12.049
But they believed me.

36:12.117 --> 36:15.085
Everyone believed me.

36:15.153 --> 36:18.689
I mean, I had to go ahead with everything

36:18.757 --> 36:21.225
after that, didn't I?

36:21.293 --> 36:23.927
I had the whole world fooled.

36:23.995 --> 36:27.564
They all thought that I was crazy.

36:27.632 --> 36:30.066
And now they think I'm getting better.

36:30.134 --> 36:32.870
I'm a really good actor, Keelin.

36:32.937 --> 36:35.105
When I get out of here,

36:35.173 --> 36:36.974
I think I'm going to go to California

36:37.041 --> 36:39.042
and I'm going to do movies.

36:39.110 --> 36:41.545
I bet you my parents love me enough

36:41.613 --> 36:43.947
to buy a house in Beverly Hills.

36:47.318 --> 36:49.219
Oh, my God.

36:52.791 --> 36:53.925
Thank you.

36:53.993 --> 36:55.693
I'll knock if I need anything.

36:57.163 --> 37:00.365
I'm not supposed to have visitors.

37:00.433 --> 37:02.801
Yeah, well, they made a little--

37:02.869 --> 37:05.137
a little exception for me.

37:05.205 --> 37:08.474
I'm sorry if I got you in trouble.

37:08.542 --> 37:10.810
I had to do that to Chad.

37:10.877 --> 37:12.311
I had to.

37:12.379 --> 37:13.946
You certainly did.

37:14.014 --> 37:16.783
So what kind of timetable
are we talking about here?

37:16.850 --> 37:19.118
I mean, how long are you going
to string everyone along

37:19.186 --> 37:22.721
till you start convincing them
that you're getting better?

37:22.789 --> 37:25.457
What are you talking about?

37:25.525 --> 37:28.259
You know, I don't know how you do it.

37:28.327 --> 37:31.529
I mean, if I was in here, I would go crazy.

37:31.597 --> 37:35.733
They told me that you
can't even have any books.

37:35.801 --> 37:40.070
Which is why I decided to
pay you a little visit.

37:40.138 --> 37:43.073
I'm gonna tell you a little story,
if that's all right.

37:43.141 --> 37:48.143
Just to, you know, relieve the boredom.

37:49.945 --> 37:53.112
So, once upon a time,
there was a little girl.

37:54.981 --> 37:58.482
She was 13 years old.

37:58.550 --> 38:00.584
And her parents had everything.

38:00.652 --> 38:02.819
Which meant

38:02.886 --> 38:06.420
the little girl pretty much had everything.

38:06.487 --> 38:11.089
But for this little girl,
pretty much was not good enough.

38:11.156 --> 38:13.357
She wanted it all.

38:13.425 --> 38:15.791
But she didn't want to
have to wait to inherit it,

38:15.858 --> 38:16.823
and she didn't want

38:16.891 --> 38:19.521
to have to earn it herself.

38:19.589 --> 38:22.455
She needed a shortcut.

38:22.523 --> 38:25.090
So she came up with a plan
with her older brother.

38:25.157 --> 38:30.691
She decided to pretend that she was crazy.

38:30.758 --> 38:33.559
And she was so good at it,

38:33.627 --> 38:35.793
that the whole world believed her.

38:35.861 --> 38:38.095
So much so,

38:38.163 --> 38:41.698
that when her brother actually
murdered their parents,

38:41.766 --> 38:43.533
no one had any trouble believing

38:43.600 --> 38:46.001
it was the crazy, sick little girl;

38:46.068 --> 38:48.736
that her demons had gotten the best of her.

38:48.803 --> 38:50.770
That she just had to get packed away

38:50.838 --> 38:53.806
and shipped off to a hospital,
so she could get all better.

38:57.644 --> 38:59.911
This story is stupid.

38:59.979 --> 39:01.979
It doesn't make any sense.

39:02.047 --> 39:04.381
Why would anyone want to be here--

39:04.449 --> 39:07.617
locked up in a place like this?

39:07.684 --> 39:10.553
Because people like you,
once they're feeling better,

39:10.620 --> 39:15.424
once they can handle the world,
well, they get to go home.

39:17.293 --> 39:19.829
It was just about to happen.

39:19.896 --> 39:22.431
Everything was going according
to the little girl's plan,

39:22.499 --> 39:25.101
but then she made one little mistake.

39:26.704 --> 39:29.439
She talked to her roommate.

39:29.507 --> 39:32.176
She told her everything.

39:32.244 --> 39:34.880
You know, the little girl
thought that this was safe

39:34.948 --> 39:38.918
because the roommate-- she didn't speak.

39:38.985 --> 39:40.953
She couldn't speak.

39:41.021 --> 39:43.890
Catatonic friends are great like that.

39:43.958 --> 39:47.094
When Keelin started waking up,

39:47.162 --> 39:49.630
when you realized that she was repeating

39:49.698 --> 39:52.100
everything you said,
you must have been scared.

39:52.168 --> 39:54.037
Lucky for you

39:54.104 --> 39:57.040
that doctor didn't go
straight to the police.

39:57.108 --> 40:01.212
He just used everything he
knew to try to get rich.

40:01.279 --> 40:05.417
But of course, he underestimated
how lucky and smart you are.

40:05.485 --> 40:08.855
Lucky because Keelin ran away.

40:08.922 --> 40:10.623
You're smart because, once that happened,

40:10.691 --> 40:13.994
you had your brother kill Dr. Woodel.

40:14.062 --> 40:16.798
So everyone would think she did it.

40:16.865 --> 40:19.267
And just like that,
both of your problems were solved.

40:20.303 --> 40:23.672
I'm confused.

40:23.740 --> 40:25.575
You said this was a story,

40:25.642 --> 40:28.678
but you keep using the names of real people.

40:28.746 --> 40:32.649
Is that to make it more entertaining?

40:32.716 --> 40:34.751
Yes. Hmm.

40:34.818 --> 40:38.788
to make it entertaining and fun.

40:38.856 --> 40:41.424
And now I'm going to use my own name.

40:41.492 --> 40:45.929
You remember when I showed up,
started asking questions

40:45.997 --> 40:48.265
about your brother, about how
he might be the real killer?

40:48.333 --> 40:50.601
When did you decide

40:50.668 --> 40:53.270
to kill him?

40:53.338 --> 40:56.273
That you actually had to
kill someone yourself?

41:04.215 --> 41:05.682
Are you done?

41:05.750 --> 41:07.684
I don't know.

41:07.752 --> 41:09.319
How do you think it ends?

41:15.158 --> 41:18.792
She gets away with it.

41:21.262 --> 41:23.863
Well...

41:23.930 --> 41:25.931
Yeah, you might be right.

41:28.301 --> 41:30.402
You know, there's one part of the story

41:30.469 --> 41:33.438
that still bothers me.

41:33.505 --> 41:36.040
What really happened to your friend Keelin?

41:36.108 --> 41:38.008
I mean, how did she get out of here?

41:38.076 --> 41:40.677
And how did your brother find her?

41:40.744 --> 41:43.946
Unless--

41:44.013 --> 41:47.049
she never really escaped.

41:47.117 --> 41:49.118
And she was here the whole time.

41:49.186 --> 41:53.957
And you killed her.

41:54.024 --> 41:56.492
You did it, didn't you?

41:56.560 --> 41:58.294
She's still here.
She's still here somewhere.

41:58.361 --> 42:00.763
And I'm guessing it's in that little garden

42:00.830 --> 42:02.164
that you love so much.

42:02.232 --> 42:04.769
It's a good place to bury a body,
don't you think?

42:07.139 --> 42:11.108
This is the exciting part of the story.

42:11.176 --> 42:13.911
Soon we're going to find out if I'm right.

42:13.978 --> 42:15.981
'Cause I brought some police with me,

42:16.049 --> 42:18.756
and they-- they brought some dogs.

42:18.824 --> 42:22.493
The kind of dogs that can smell drugs

42:22.561 --> 42:24.695
and corpses.

42:27.499 --> 42:29.935
Oh, look...

42:30.003 --> 42:31.403
the dogs found something already.

42:31.471 --> 42:34.672
You bitch!

42:34.740 --> 42:35.772
Now there you are.

42:35.839 --> 42:37.906
There's the real Summer Lowry.

42:37.974 --> 42:39.408
Well, welcome back.

42:39.475 --> 42:42.177
You know this hospital here,

42:42.244 --> 42:45.045
it's not bad, all things considered.

42:45.112 --> 42:47.679
But I don't think you're
going to be spending

42:47.747 --> 42:49.714
a lot of time here.

42:49.782 --> 42:53.250
I think you're going to be going to prison.

42:55.686 --> 42:58.855
And that-- that is the ending of the story.

42:58.922 --> 43:02.192
Bet you didn't see that coming.

43:05.596 --> 43:07.063
Thanks.
