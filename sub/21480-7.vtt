00:39.180 --> 00:42.070
WE'RE NOT A THREAT.
WE'RE SALVATION.

00:42.100 --> 00:44.680
THE WORLD
WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH US.

00:47.860 --> 00:49.040
I'M NOT YOUR LITTLE BROTHER
ANYMORE.

00:49.070 --> 00:51.070
THEN STOP ACTING
LIKE A TWO-YEAR-OLD.

00:51.110 --> 00:53.780
YOU'RE MY BROTHER.
SHE'S YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

00:53.820 --> 00:54.900
IT'S ALL GOOD.

00:54.940 --> 00:56.560
YOU GODDAMN FREAK!

00:56.600 --> 00:58.870
DANNY,STOP IT!
STOP BLAMING ME FOR NIKKI!

00:58.900 --> 00:59.630
DIANA SKOURIS,

00:59.660 --> 01:02.570
YOUR ADOPTION OF MAIA RUTLEDGE
IS HEREBY COMPLETE.

01:02.610 --> 01:03.530
HE'S GONNA DIE.

01:03.570 --> 01:05.770
I SAW IT. HE'S GONNA DIE.

01:05.800 --> 01:07.270
JORDAN COLLIER?

01:07.310 --> 01:08.710
SOMEONE'S GOING TO KILL HIM.

01:08.750 --> 01:10.080
NO!

01:10.160 --> 01:11.600
NO!

01:11.640 --> 01:13.960
HIS BODY,
IT'S NOT THERE!

01:14.020 --> 01:15.930
THIS IS
YOUR NEW HOUSE?

01:15.960 --> 01:17.000
IT'S YOURS TOO.

01:17.030 --> 01:18.900
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD
TO THIS MOMENT FOR TOO LONG.

01:18.930 --> 01:20.990
ONLY ONE THING
MISSING--

01:21.130 --> 01:22.320
MOM.

01:22.350 --> 01:23.690
WE REALLY TRIED TO MAKE IT WORK.

01:23.720 --> 01:24.740
HOW WAS YOUR FIRST DAY
OF COLLEGE?

01:24.770 --> 01:25.990
I DIDN'T HAVE ONE.

01:26.030 --> 01:27.400
NOBODY PAID
MY TUITION.

01:27.440 --> 01:29.320
I'M SORRY,KYLE.
I MUST HAVE FORGOT.

01:29.360 --> 01:30.770
YOU'VE BEEN TALKING
ABOUT THIS FOR MONTHS.

01:30.810 --> 01:31.880
HOW COULD YOU FORGET?

01:31.910 --> 01:33.110
YOU SPENT THREE YEARS
IN A COMA.

01:33.140 --> 01:35.060
YOU HAVE NO BUSINESS
DRINKING ANYTHING!

01:35.100 --> 01:37.630
YOU TOLD ME EVERYTHING
THAT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT,RIGHT?

01:37.660 --> 01:38.930
YEAH.

01:57.010 --> 01:57.910
ANY COFFEE LEFT?

01:57.950 --> 01:59.200
HELP YOURSELF.

01:59.240 --> 02:01.350
COULDN'T FIND A CLEAN T-SHIRT?

02:01.430 --> 02:03.430
THIS IS WHAT I WEAR
TO SCHOOL.

02:04.050 --> 02:05.460
I LIKE IT.
YOU'RE LOOKING SHARP.

02:05.510 --> 02:06.720
THANKS.

02:07.810 --> 02:09.370
SO...

02:09.710 --> 02:11.490
HOW YOU DOING,DAD?

02:12.390 --> 02:13.100
GOOD.

02:13.140 --> 02:14.500
FINE. WHY?

02:14.580 --> 02:15.890
NO REASON.
JUST,UH...

02:15.930 --> 02:18.660
YOU KNOW,GOOD LUCK.
OKAY?

02:18.710 --> 02:21.010
I'LL BE THINKING
ABOUT YOU.

02:22.270 --> 02:24.960
I'LL CALL YOU.
SEE HOW IT GOES.

02:24.990 --> 02:26.420
OKAY?

02:26.480 --> 02:27.850
SEE YOU.

02:32.590 --> 02:34.420
HEY,
THERE HE IS!

02:40.380 --> 02:41.460
WHAT'S ALL THIS?

02:41.500 --> 02:43.020
WELCOME BACK.

02:43.050 --> 02:44.820
THE PRODIGAL SON
RETURNS.

02:44.890 --> 02:45.710
RETURNS FROM WHERE?

02:45.750 --> 02:47.720
GET YOUR GEAR ON.
WE GOT TO ROLL.

02:47.750 --> 02:50.630
TOM,I AM SO GLAD
TO SEE YOU.

02:50.670 --> 02:52.190
YEAH,YOU AND EVERYONE ELSE.

02:52.230 --> 02:53.260
AS SOON AS WE TAKE
DOHERTY DOWN,

02:53.290 --> 02:54.560
WE'RE GOING TO
POP THE CHAMPAGNE.

02:54.600 --> 02:55.550
DOHERTY?
WHO'S DOHERTY?

02:55.580 --> 02:57.700
DIANA,STOP.
FILL ME IN HERE.

02:57.740 --> 02:58.460
WHO'S DOHERTY?

02:58.490 --> 03:00.020
DOES HE HAVE SOMETHING
TO DO WITH COLLIER'S MURDER?

03:00.060 --> 03:01.810
WHAT,GOVERNOR COLLIER?

03:01.840 --> 03:04.490
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
HE'S NOT DEAD.

03:04.520 --> 03:06.390
THIS WAS
GARRITY'S IDEA,RIGHT?

03:06.420 --> 03:08.170
GOT TO ADMIT,
IT'S CREATIVE,

03:08.210 --> 03:09.910
BUT "SCREW WITH
TOM BALDWIN DAY"IS OVER.

03:09.960 --> 03:11.900
HEY,LISTEN,TOM,
DON'T DO THIS.

03:11.930 --> 03:13.500
THE DOCTORS GAVE YOU
A CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH.

03:13.540 --> 03:14.720
DOCTORS?
WHAT DOCTORS?

03:14.750 --> 03:16.070
WHERE IS EVERYBODY HEADED?

03:16.100 --> 03:17.770
AND WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON
AROUND HERE TODAY?

03:17.820 --> 03:19.280
I THINK YOU SHOULD
PROBABLY JUST STAY HERE.

03:19.320 --> 03:20.610
WE'LL TALK
WHEN I GET BACK.

03:20.640 --> 03:22.500
DIANA,JUST--

03:22.570 --> 03:24.830
SO,THIS GUY,DOHERTY,
IS HE A 4400?

03:24.860 --> 03:26.050
WHAT'S A 4400?

03:26.080 --> 03:27.640
PLEASE,STOP THIS.

03:27.710 --> 03:29.730
FOUR THOUSAND,FOUR HUNDRED
MISSING PEOPLE...

03:29.770 --> 03:31.280
THE FUTURE SENT THEM BACK
IN A BALL OF LIGHT.

03:31.300 --> 03:33.410
ANY OF THIS
SOUND FAMILIAR?

03:36.950 --> 03:38.900
DIANA,
I'M NOT LAUGHING,

03:38.940 --> 03:39.810
SO WHATEVER GAME
YOU'RE PLAYING,

03:39.840 --> 03:41.100
STOP IT,AND STOP IT RIGHT NOW.

03:41.120 --> 03:42.380
TOM,WHATEVER
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH

03:42.420 --> 03:43.370
IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS,

03:43.400 --> 03:44.550
I CAN'T EVEN
IMAGINE IT,

03:44.570 --> 03:46.180
AND EVERYONE HERE IS PULLING
FOR YOUR RECOVERY,

03:46.210 --> 03:48.020
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO
LISTEN TO YOURSELF.

03:48.070 --> 03:49.470
YOU SOUND DELUSIONAL.

03:49.520 --> 03:50.240
THE FUTURE?

03:50.290 --> 03:51.910
I MEAN,I'VE NEVER
HEARD OF THE 4400,

03:51.940 --> 03:52.710
AND I CAN PROMISE YOU

03:52.740 --> 03:57.060
THAT NOBODY EVER CAME BACK
IN A BALL OF LIGHT.

05:05.460 --> 05:06.170
TELL ME ONE THING.

05:06.210 --> 05:07.590
ACCORDING TO YOU,

05:07.630 --> 05:09.470
WHAT HAVE WE BEEN DOING
FOR THE LAST YEAR?

05:09.490 --> 05:10.710
YOU'RE SERIOUS.

05:10.740 --> 05:11.380
HUMOR ME.

05:11.400 --> 05:12.750
IT'S YOUR CASE,
TOM.

05:12.780 --> 05:14.230
DIRTY BOMBS,
REMEMBER?

05:14.270 --> 05:15.150
YOU WENT UNDERCOVER

05:15.180 --> 05:18.150
AND INFILTRATED
AN AUM SHINRIKYO TERROR CELL.

05:18.190 --> 05:19.810
NONE OF THIS MEANS ANYTHING
TO YOU,DOES IT?

05:19.830 --> 05:20.800
OF COURSE NOT.
WHY SHOULD IT?

05:20.830 --> 05:22.490
WELL,YOUR COVER
WAS COMPROMISED.

05:22.530 --> 05:24.260
THEY HELD YOU
FOR THREE WEEKS.

05:24.290 --> 05:25.870
SLEEP DEPRIVATION,
TORTURE--

05:25.900 --> 05:27.280
THEY'D HAVE KILLED YOU
IF YOU DIDN'T ESCAPE.

05:27.310 --> 05:28.280
SO HOW DOES DOHERTY
FIT IN?

05:28.320 --> 05:30.550
AUM SHINRIKYO'S BEEN PLANNING
AN ATTACK ON THE U.S.

05:30.570 --> 05:32.230
SINCE THEY'VE BEEN SNEAKING
RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL

05:32.260 --> 05:34.190
INTO THE COUNTRY
IN MUSEUM POUCHES.

05:34.220 --> 05:35.140
DOHERTY'S THE CURATOR.

05:35.170 --> 05:36.740
HE'S BEEN IN BED WITH THEM
ALL ALONG.

05:36.770 --> 05:38.870
TOM,HE SOLD YOU OUT.

05:38.910 --> 05:40.960
YOU SPENT THREE WEEKS IN HELL
'CAUSE OF THIS GUY.

05:40.990 --> 05:42.070
YOU'VE BEEN
ON MEDICAL LEAVE

05:42.110 --> 05:44.320
FOR TWO MONTHS,
RECOVERING,AND...

05:44.360 --> 05:47.750
OBVIOUSLY,
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THREE.

05:53.830 --> 05:55.770
JORDAN COLLIER
MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART.

05:55.800 --> 05:57.390
TELL ME YOU RECOGNIZE
THIS PLACE.

05:57.420 --> 05:58.270
I RECOGNIZE IT,ALL RIGHT...

05:58.290 --> 05:59.270
WELL,THAT'S A START.

05:59.290 --> 06:02.250
BUT EVERYTHING'S DIFFERENT.

06:12.040 --> 06:12.870
THIS IS THE SPOT.

06:12.900 --> 06:15.810
THIS IS WHERE COLLIER GOT SHOT.

06:15.850 --> 06:16.660
DO ME A FAVOR.

06:16.700 --> 06:19.560
DON'T LET ANYONE ELSE
HEAR YOU SAY THAT.

06:24.400 --> 06:25.620
TOM?

07:20.220 --> 07:21.710
TOM!

07:22.930 --> 07:25.010
IS HE IN THERE?

07:28.720 --> 07:30.870
YEAH,I THINK SO.

07:41.330 --> 07:43.530
YOU WANT TO DO
THE HONORS?

07:53.100 --> 07:54.250
DID YOU FIND
ANYTHING?

07:54.280 --> 07:55.490
SOMEBODY'S BEEN MESSING
WITH MY COMPUTER.

07:55.510 --> 07:57.670
ALL MY CASE FILES ARE GONE.

07:57.690 --> 08:00.730
I TYPE "4400"
INTO A SEARCH ENGINE,AND...

08:01.120 --> 08:01.620
NOTHING.

08:01.670 --> 08:03.430
HOW COULD THERE NOT BE
A SINGLE MENTION OF THEM?

08:03.470 --> 08:05.220
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE BECAUSE...

08:05.240 --> 08:06.240
NONE OF IT EVER HAPPENED?

08:06.290 --> 08:08.300
SOMETHING HAS OBVIOUSLY
CHANGED.

08:08.330 --> 08:11.150
THIS IS NOT THE SAME WORLD
THAT IT WAS YESTERDAY.

08:11.200 --> 08:13.590
BUT I'M STILL TOM BALDWIN,

08:13.610 --> 08:15.090
AND YOU'RE STILL DIANA SKOURIS,

08:15.100 --> 08:18.230
WHICH MEANS THAT THE PEOPLE
THEY TOOK,

08:18.250 --> 08:19.880
THEY EXIST TOO,RIGHT?

08:19.920 --> 08:21.200
GARY NAVARRO.

08:21.220 --> 08:22.270
WE WORKED WITH HIM LAST MONTH.

08:22.290 --> 08:23.000
HE COULD READ THOUGHTS.

08:23.010 --> 08:23.990
READ THOUGHTS?

08:24.010 --> 08:25.940
TOM,COME ON.

08:26.020 --> 08:27.380
PLAYED FOR CINCINNATI?

08:27.420 --> 08:28.530
LIFETIME .317 BATTING AVERAGE.

08:28.550 --> 08:29.350
ISN'T IT .300

08:29.380 --> 08:30.880
WHEN YOU KNOW WHAT
THE PITCHER'S THINKING?

08:30.930 --> 08:33.960
BUT...HE WAS NEVER TAKEN!

08:36.070 --> 08:36.600
RICHARD TYLER.

08:36.640 --> 08:37.929
WHAT DID HE HAVE?
HEAT VISION?

08:38.000 --> 08:39.600
NO,SOME OF THEM
CAN DO...THINGS.

08:39.630 --> 08:43.270
SOME OF THEM...
SOME OF THEM CAN'T.

08:43.600 --> 08:44.820
HE'S DEAD.

08:44.830 --> 08:47.340
HE'S PLANE WAS SHOT DOWN
OVER SINANJU IN 1951.

08:47.380 --> 08:48.630
SO THAT'S TWO DOWN.

08:48.660 --> 08:51.040
ARE WE GOING TO GO THROUGH
ALL 4,398 MORE?

08:51.050 --> 08:52.130
I'LL TAKE MY BOOTS OFF
IF WE ARE.

08:52.150 --> 08:54.390
DIANA,YOUR DAUGHTER.
YOUR DAUGHTER!

08:54.540 --> 08:55.850
YOUR DAUGHTER,MAIA RUTLEDGE.

08:55.880 --> 08:56.950
YOU ADOPTED HER,
RIGHT?

08:56.980 --> 08:57.620
SHE'S ONE OF THEM.

08:57.650 --> 09:00.300
TOM,DON'T INCLUDE ME
IN YOUR FANTASY LIFE.

09:00.330 --> 09:01.950
YOU KNOW I DON'T HAVE
A DAUGHTER.

09:02.000 --> 09:02.580
YES! RIGHT HERE.

09:02.610 --> 09:04.430
IT'S A SEATTLE ADDRESS
FOR MAIA RUTLEDGE.

09:04.450 --> 09:05.460
IT'S RIGHT HERE.

09:05.490 --> 09:07.160
RIGHT HERE.

09:14.170 --> 09:16.210
OH,THANK GOD.
MAIA,IT'S ME.

09:16.240 --> 09:18.680
IT'S ME,TOM.
TOM BALDWIN.

09:18.720 --> 09:20.170
I DON'T KNOW YOU.

09:20.210 --> 09:21.930
DON'T SAY THAT,PLEASE.

09:21.960 --> 09:23.680
- DON'T SAY THAT.
- MY NAME IS ELLA.

09:23.710 --> 09:24.940
MAIA'S MY GRANDMOTHER.

09:24.970 --> 09:26.530
ELLA,WHO IS IT?

09:26.560 --> 09:27.970
OH,HERE SHE IS.

09:28.010 --> 09:29.990
THIS IS MY GRANDMOTHER.

09:35.210 --> 09:36.110
YOU'RE MAIA RUTLEDGE?

09:36.140 --> 09:38.100
CAN I HELP YOU?

09:47.620 --> 09:50.270
DIDN'T EXPECT YOU HOME
SO SOON.

09:52.660 --> 09:54.850
HOW'D YOU DO OUT THERE
TODAY?

09:55.510 --> 09:56.860
GLAD TO SEE YOU,TOO.
EVERYTHING OKAY?

09:56.890 --> 09:59.350
JUST TELL ME ONE THING.

09:59.400 --> 10:01.910
YOU WERE IN A COMA
FOR THREE YEARS,RIGHT?

10:01.950 --> 10:03.210
IF I HAVE ONE MORE OF THESE,

10:03.230 --> 10:06.330
I COULD WIND UP IN A COMA
RIGHT NOW.

10:06.370 --> 10:06.610
COME ON.

10:06.630 --> 10:07.460
I WANT TO SHOW YOU
SOMETHING.

10:07.480 --> 10:08.520
COME ON.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.760
UNCLE TOMMY.
WE CAN EAT,FINALLY.

10:16.790 --> 10:17.460
HOW YOU DOING?

10:17.470 --> 10:19.940
SHAWN,WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

10:19.960 --> 10:21.330
WELL,THE BAND
GOT DELAYED IN BERLIN.

10:21.350 --> 10:22.960
WE'RE NOT GOING TO START
RECORDING UNTIL TUESDAY.

10:22.980 --> 10:24.930
BESIDES,I COULDN'T MISS
YOUR BIG DAY.

10:24.980 --> 10:26.970
OR DANNY'S.
COME ON,TELL THEM.

10:26.990 --> 10:28.710
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
SHE ACTUALLY SAID "YES."

10:28.740 --> 10:29.370
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED.

10:29.400 --> 10:31.140
LOOK,HE BOUGHT ME THIS!

10:31.160 --> 10:32.690
OH,I TOLD HIM
I DIDN'T EVEN WANT ONE

10:32.720 --> 10:34.200
TILL HE WAS
OUT OF LAW SCHOOL.

10:34.230 --> 10:35.760
I LIKE THAT.
YOU LIKE THAT?

10:35.780 --> 10:38.340
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT,MR. BALDWIN?

10:39.700 --> 10:40.660
DAD,DO YOU
NEED TO SIT?

10:40.690 --> 10:41.260
IT CAN'T BE A JOKE.

10:41.270 --> 10:42.780
THERE'S TOO MANY PEOPLE
IN ON IT.

10:42.810 --> 10:44.650
SIT DOWN.

10:44.690 --> 10:47.270
SO THEN EITHER
I'M CRACKING UP,

10:47.290 --> 10:49.320
OR THE WORLD IS.

10:49.830 --> 10:51.270
DAD,THE DOCTORS SAID
YOU WERE OKAY.

10:51.300 --> 10:53.650
I DON'T WANT TO SCARE YOU,
BUT SOMETHING'S WRONG.

10:53.680 --> 10:55.730
I DON'T RECOGNIZE
THIS PLACE.

10:55.780 --> 10:56.750
I MEAN,
I SORT OF DO,

10:56.780 --> 10:58.070
BUT EVERYTHING'S
BEEN TWEAKED.

10:58.110 --> 11:00.600
DAD,DAD,
LOOK AT ME.

11:00.630 --> 11:01.710
YOU'RE NOT MAKING
ANY SENSE.

11:01.740 --> 11:03.390
YOU KNOW THAT,
RIGHT?

11:03.440 --> 11:04.420
YOU GUYS STARTED
WITHOUT US?

11:04.450 --> 11:06.880
JUST AS WELL.
AIRPORT TRAFFIC WAS INSANE.

11:06.940 --> 11:08.880
HI,GUYS,NIKKI.

11:08.930 --> 11:10.470
CAN YOU BELIEVE MY KID,
MY YOUNGEST KID,

11:10.500 --> 11:12.240
IS GETTING MARRIED?

11:12.270 --> 11:14.290
WHEN THE HELL
DID WE GET SO OLD?

11:14.320 --> 11:15.740
SO YOU'RE BACK IN THE SADDLE.

11:15.770 --> 11:16.660
HOW'D IT GO?

11:16.680 --> 11:18.030
I DON'T THINK IT WENT TOO GOOD.

11:18.070 --> 11:19.820
REALLY? I WAS JUST
TELLING YOUR WIFE

11:19.850 --> 11:20.740
THAT YOU WERE GOING
TO BE FINE.

11:20.760 --> 11:22.010
MY WIFE?

11:22.040 --> 11:23.020
I'M STILL MARRIED TO LINDA?

11:23.050 --> 11:26.200
I SAID WIFE,
NOT EX-WIFE.

11:26.480 --> 11:29.870
ALANA,OVER HERE.
COME HERE.

11:30.800 --> 11:34.130
I'VE NEVER SEEN THIS WOMAN
BEFORE.

11:34.440 --> 11:36.410
I THINK WE NEED TO BE ALONE...

11:36.440 --> 11:37.960
GO UPSTAIRS. TALK.

11:37.980 --> 11:39.590
NO. I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

11:39.620 --> 11:40.950
DAD,ALANA'S
YOUR WIFE.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.290
YOU'VE BEEN MARRIED TO HER
FOR TWO YEARS.

11:42.300 --> 11:43.430
SHE LIVES HERE,DAD.

11:43.460 --> 11:45.250
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ANY OF YOU ARE
TALKING ABOUT,BUT IT'S OVER.

11:45.270 --> 11:46.550
IT'S OVER,
IT'S OVER.

12:31.870 --> 12:33.170
HOW'D YOU FIND ME?

12:33.190 --> 12:34.830
GUYS DOWNSTAIRS CALLED.

12:34.870 --> 12:37.300
THEY SAID YOU'VE BEEN
HERE FOUR HOURS.

12:37.340 --> 12:39.930
YEAH.
SAD,ISN'T IT?

12:40.040 --> 12:40.920
THE ONLY PLACE
I FEEL NORMAL

12:40.940 --> 12:44.080
IS HIDING
IN A STORAGE CLOSET.

12:44.200 --> 12:46.220
I GUESS THAT'S WHAT IT MUST
FEEL LIKE TO BE INSANE--

12:46.240 --> 12:48.950
YOU'RE NOT INSANE,TOM.

12:48.970 --> 12:51.040
YOU JUST NEED A REST.

12:51.090 --> 12:54.790
EVERYONE KEEPS TELLING ME
I WAS TORTURED.

12:54.830 --> 12:55.800
MAYBE THEY BROKE MY MIND.

12:55.820 --> 12:58.690
YOU'RE GOING TO COME BACK
FROM THIS,TOM.

12:58.740 --> 13:01.320
IT'S JUST GOING
TO TAKE SOME TIME.

13:01.530 --> 13:04.840
AND I'M GOING TO HELP YOU,
I PROMISE.

13:15.200 --> 13:17.860
SO TELL ME AGAIN
ABOUT THIS BALL OF LIGHT.

13:17.890 --> 13:19.790
WHEN DID YOU FIRST COME
TO BELIEVE IT HAPPENED?

13:19.880 --> 13:21.800
AUGUST 14th,2004.

13:21.810 --> 13:23.620
THAT'S WHEN THEY CAME BACK.

13:23.650 --> 13:26.210
MAYBE NOT IN THE WORLD YOU KNOW,
BUT IT HAPPENED IN MINE--

13:26.260 --> 13:27.100
GET HER OUT OF HERE!

13:27.140 --> 13:28.540
NO ONE'S PLOTTING AGAINST YOU,
TOM.

13:28.590 --> 13:30.690
I DID WHAT I HAD TO DO
TO GET YOU BETTER.

13:30.730 --> 13:31.540
HIS WIFE'S HERE.

13:31.580 --> 13:32.710
SHE'S ASKING TO SEE HIM.

13:32.730 --> 13:37.270
I AM NOT MARRIED.
I AM NOT MARRIED...

13:51.860 --> 13:53.110
LOOK,LADY,I DON'T
KNOW WHO YOU ARE,

13:53.150 --> 13:55.250
AND I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY.

13:55.280 --> 13:57.430
YOU HAVE TO
PLAY ALONG.

13:57.520 --> 13:58.650
I NEED YOU TO
GET OUT OF HERE

13:58.690 --> 14:00.350
SO WE CAN FIGURE OUT
WHAT'S GOING ON.

14:00.380 --> 14:02.160
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

14:02.200 --> 14:04.750
NONE OF THIS IS REAL
TO ME,EITHER.

14:04.800 --> 14:05.870
I KNOW WE'RE
NOT MARRIED.

14:05.910 --> 14:09.070
I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU
BEFORE YESTERDAY.

14:09.670 --> 14:12.130
THE THINGS YOU TALK ABOUT--

14:12.130 --> 14:13.530
THE BALL OF LIGHT,

14:13.580 --> 14:16.020
THE 4400...

14:17.070 --> 14:19.310
YOU KNOW ABOUT THE 4400?

14:19.350 --> 14:21.060
KNOW OF THEM?

14:21.090 --> 14:24.340
I AM A 4400.

14:31.090 --> 14:32.810
I KNOW MY BEHAVIOR
WAS TOTALLY OUT OF LINE,

14:32.830 --> 14:35.110
AND I WANT TO APOLOGIZE.

14:35.140 --> 14:36.730
I GOT FIXATED
ON GETTING BACK TO WORK,

14:36.760 --> 14:39.100
AND OBVIOUSLY,
THE STRAIN,THE,UH...

14:39.120 --> 14:41.900
THE EXCITEMENT,
IT WAS JUST TOO MUCH.

14:45.500 --> 14:46.690
WE'RE GOING TO EXTEND
YOUR MEDICAL LEAVE

14:46.710 --> 14:48.140
BY ANOTHER
SIX WEEKS,

14:48.170 --> 14:50.390
AND THEN WE WILL SEE ABOUT
GETTING YOU BACK OUT IN THE FIELD.

14:50.400 --> 14:52.000
I'LL CIRCLE THE DATE.

14:52.040 --> 14:53.690
OKAY.

14:53.800 --> 14:55.660
SO I CAN GO NOW?

14:55.690 --> 14:57.800
YOUR PSYCH HOLD IS OVER.

15:01.840 --> 15:02.920
GREAT.

15:03.400 --> 15:04.740
I'M...
I'M SORRY FOR THE AMBUSH.

15:04.770 --> 15:07.720
DESPERATE TIMES,
DESPERATE MEASURES.

15:09.550 --> 15:11.960
I'LL SEE YOU
IN SIX WEEKS.

15:17.560 --> 15:18.500
TOM BALDWIN.

15:18.540 --> 15:20.400
ALANA MAREVA.

15:20.430 --> 15:22.080
SO I GUESS WE'RE MARRIED.

15:22.120 --> 15:24.230
SO I'M TOLD.

15:24.420 --> 15:26.250
LET'S GO HOME.

15:26.280 --> 15:29.010
SEE IF WE CAN FIGURE OUT
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON.

15:29.030 --> 15:30.540
-WHERE DO YOU THINK WE ARE?
- I DON'T KNOW.

15:30.560 --> 15:32.760
MAYBE WE CROSSED INTO
SOME KIND OF...

15:32.800 --> 15:35.770
ALTERNATE REALITY,
A DIFFERENT DIMENSION.

15:37.610 --> 15:38.580
I KNOW.
IT SOUNDS INSANE.

15:38.600 --> 15:39.600
IT SOUNDS IMPOSSIBLE.

15:39.640 --> 15:42.720
IMPOSSIBLE
ISN'T WHAT IT USED TO BE,AND...

15:43.130 --> 15:44.310
YOU'RE A 4400.

15:44.350 --> 15:45.780
YOU THINK I'M DOING THIS?

15:45.830 --> 15:47.920
IT'S AN EXPLANATION.

15:47.940 --> 15:49.040
A PRETTY SIMPLE ONE,ACTUALLY.

15:49.060 --> 15:51.150
SIMPLE,BUT WRONG.

15:51.180 --> 15:52.810
IF I WERE MAKING THIS UP,

15:52.850 --> 15:55.830
WHY WOULD I PUT MYSELF
IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR LIFE?

15:55.880 --> 15:58.280
I'M SORRY.THIS CAN'T
BE EASY FOR YOU,EITHER.

15:58.300 --> 16:00.150
YEAH,EASY.

16:00.170 --> 16:03.500
MY FRIENDS,MY FAMILY,
EVERYTHING I KNOW IS GONE.

16:03.550 --> 16:05.420
ERASED.

16:05.460 --> 16:08.090
I'M TRAPPED
IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR LIFE.

16:08.130 --> 16:09.800
HOW DO I KNOW IT'S NOT YOU
MAKING THIS UP?

16:09.810 --> 16:10.230
ERASED?

16:10.250 --> 16:12.450
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOUR LIFE HAS BEEN ERASED?

16:13.220 --> 16:14.340
I USED TO OWN
THIS PLACE.

16:14.370 --> 16:15.630
I BOUGHT IT
FOUR YEARS AGO,

16:15.670 --> 16:17.750
A FEW MONTHS
BEFORE I WAS ABDUCTED.

16:17.800 --> 16:19.650
AND NONE OF THIS
LOOKS FAMILIAR NOW?

16:19.670 --> 16:20.670
I WAS MY OWN BUYER.

16:20.720 --> 16:21.710
I FLEW ALL OVER THE WORLD

16:21.750 --> 16:23.690
AND BOUGHT
MOSTLY SCULPTURES,

16:23.730 --> 16:25.750
PRIMITIVE ART.

16:27.570 --> 16:28.980
EXCUSE ME.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.700
CAN I TALK TO THE OWNER?

16:30.730 --> 16:32.670
HE'S NOT HERE TODAY.

16:32.700 --> 16:33.970
ANY IDEA
WHEN HE OPENED THIS PLACE?

16:34.010 --> 16:35.140
A LONG TIME AGO.

16:35.170 --> 16:38.000
15,MAYBE 20 YEARS.

16:38.770 --> 16:40.310
IT ONLY GETS WORSE.

16:40.360 --> 16:41.390
YOU'RE SURE
THAT'S THE RIGHT BENCH?

16:41.430 --> 16:43.340
I USED TO COME HERE
EVERY WEEK.

16:43.370 --> 16:45.000
BELIEVE ME,I KNOW WHICH BENCH
I DEDICATED

16:45.040 --> 16:46.330
TO MY HUSBAND AND SON.

16:46.370 --> 16:47.920
SO BACK IN THE WORLD
WE CAME FROM...

16:47.960 --> 16:49.740
THEY DIED...

16:50.960 --> 16:52.880
IN A CAR ACCIDENT...

16:52.940 --> 16:56.070
SHORTLY BEFORE I WAS ABDUCTED.

16:56.340 --> 16:57.180
THERE'S A WAY BACK HOME.

16:57.220 --> 16:59.050
WE'RE GOING TO FIND IT.

17:05.630 --> 17:08.440
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING,
I'LL BE RIGHT DOWN THE HALL.

17:08.460 --> 17:10.390
WHAT,YOU'RE SLEEPING
IN THE GUEST ROOM?

17:10.430 --> 17:12.710
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES,
YEAH.

17:12.750 --> 17:14.530
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

17:14.569 --> 17:15.280
WE HAVE TO PLAY ALONG.

17:15.300 --> 17:17.190
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
HAPPILY MARRIED.

17:17.230 --> 17:19.480
WE DON'T WANT YOUR SON
ASKING QUESTIONS.

17:25.160 --> 17:27.920
OKAY,I'LL,UH,FIND A SPOT
ON THE FLOOR.

17:27.970 --> 17:32.300
ARE YOU SURE YOU WOULDN'T BE
MORE COMFORTABLE IN THE BATHTUB?

17:32.370 --> 17:34.240
I'M KIDDING,THOMAS.

17:34.310 --> 17:35.730
IT'S A BIG BED.

17:35.770 --> 17:39.120
I'M SURE WE CAN KEEP
IN OUR OWN SECTORS.

17:45.740 --> 17:48.590
DO YOU THINK
WE'RE THE ONLY ONES?

17:48.660 --> 17:51.800
ARE THERE OTHER PEOPLE OUT THERE
LIKE US,

17:51.840 --> 17:53.420
WONDERING HOW
THEY GOT HERE?

17:53.450 --> 17:55.950
IF THERE ARE,WE'LL FIND THEM.

17:56.020 --> 17:57.070
WE'LL TAKE OUT
CLASSIFIED ADS

17:57.090 --> 17:59.320
IN EVERY MAJOR
CITY PAPER.

17:59.350 --> 18:02.910
"REMEMBER THE 4400s?
DROP US A LINE."

18:02.940 --> 18:06.330
WE'LL CHECK OUT EVERY RETURNEE
WE CAN FIND.

18:08.960 --> 18:11.920
TELL ME
SOMETHING ABOUT YOURSELF.

18:13.090 --> 18:14.880
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW?

18:14.910 --> 18:16.870
FAVORITE RECORDS?

18:16.900 --> 18:18.380
WHERE I WENT TO SCHOOL?

18:18.420 --> 18:21.570
HOW ABOUT YOUR HUSBAND AND SON?
WHAT WERE THEY LIKE?

18:26.740 --> 18:28.500
PAUL WAS A RADIOLOGIST.

18:28.530 --> 18:33.590
WE MET WHILE HE WAS ON VACATION
IN TAHITI.

18:33.700 --> 18:36.230
THAT'S WHERE I'M FROM.

18:36.600 --> 18:41.360
LINDA AND I THOUGHT ABOUT
GOING THERE FOR OUR HONEYMOON.

18:42.010 --> 18:43.890
WE PICKED HAITI INSTEAD.

18:46.470 --> 18:47.300
TWO YEARS LATER,

18:47.330 --> 18:50.670
AFTER WE WERE MARRIED,
WE HAD BILLY.

18:50.690 --> 18:54.240
HE WAS SO QUIET AND SWEET.

19:04.140 --> 19:05.520
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.

19:05.610 --> 19:07.050
I THINK THIS WAS
THE INTERVIEW

19:07.080 --> 19:08.570
WHERE I SAID I WANTED
TO GO INTO MEDICINE

19:08.610 --> 19:10.120
BECAUSE NURSES
ARE SEXY.

19:10.210 --> 19:12.730
YOU DID NOT
SAY THAT.

19:13.030 --> 19:15.600
I GOT INTO MEDICAL SCHOOL!

19:15.640 --> 19:17.780
STANFORD,BABY!

19:17.810 --> 19:19.750
CONGRATULATIONS.

19:26.640 --> 19:28.770
THE REAL KYLE USED TO TALK
ABOUT BEING A DOCTOR ALL THE TIME.

19:28.800 --> 19:29.920
RIGHT UP
UNTIL HE WENT INTO A COMA.

19:29.950 --> 19:30.920
"THE REAL KYLE..."

19:30.950 --> 19:32.530
I KNOW
THAT'S NOT EXACTLY YOUR SON,

19:32.560 --> 19:34.630
BUT HE SEEMS PRETTY REAL TO ME.

19:34.670 --> 19:37.120
HE GETS HAPPY
WHEN HE HEARS GOOD NEWS,

19:37.150 --> 19:38.320
CRANKY WHEN HE GETS TIRED,

19:38.380 --> 19:41.320
AND HE FORGETS TO PUT
THE TOILET SEAT DOWN.

19:41.350 --> 19:42.460
HE'S A GOOD KID.

19:42.510 --> 19:44.320
HE WAS RAISED WELL.

19:44.350 --> 19:47.170
I GOT A RESPONSE
FROM OUR AD IN THE POST.

19:47.840 --> 19:49.230
PHILIP KENDRICK.

19:49.260 --> 19:51.490
HE WANTS TO MEET US.

19:52.160 --> 19:53.750
PHILIP KENDRICK?

19:53.780 --> 19:55.910
TOM BALDWIN.

19:58.190 --> 20:00.040
WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER
ABOUT THE 4400?

20:00.070 --> 20:03.200
IT WAS THE BEST SEDAN
CITROEN EVER PUT OUT.

20:03.240 --> 20:05.550
HYDRAULICS CAME STANDARD
ON EVERY MODEL--

20:05.580 --> 20:06.750
YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT A CAR?

20:06.780 --> 20:08.400
YEAH!
MINE'S PARKED OUTSIDE.

20:08.430 --> 20:09.420
WHERE'S YOURS?

20:09.450 --> 20:12.120
IT'S IN THE SHOP.
I'LL SEND YOU A PICTURE.

20:12.160 --> 20:14.890
UH,TOM,
I DON'T HAVE YOUR ADDRESS.

20:14.920 --> 20:16.750
WELL,THAT WAS
PRODUCTIVE.

20:16.780 --> 20:17.770
YEAH...

20:18.060 --> 20:19.740
SHOULD WE CHECK OUT
THE BLAKE EXHIBIT

20:19.780 --> 20:21.060
WHILE WE'RE HERE?

20:21.090 --> 20:24.220
UH...YEAH,
WHY DON'T YOU...

20:24.250 --> 20:24.800
WHY DON'T YOU
GO AHEAD?

20:24.820 --> 20:27.360
I'LL CATCH UP WITH YOU
IN A MINUTE.

20:27.690 --> 20:29.090
NO,IT'S...

21:44.640 --> 21:46.100
THOMAS...

21:47.530 --> 21:49.540
THOMAS...

21:52.960 --> 21:55.030
THOMAS?

21:55.950 --> 21:57.950
THOMAS!

22:02.940 --> 22:03.670
IT'S GONE.

22:03.700 --> 22:04.300
WHAT'S GONE?

22:04.330 --> 22:06.650
THAT DOOR. IT WAS BACK.

22:06.670 --> 22:08.620
AND I OPENED IT THIS TIME.

22:08.660 --> 22:10.450
IT WAS SOME KIND OF
OPERATING ROOM,I THINK.

22:10.480 --> 22:11.590
I DIDN'T SEE
ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

22:11.620 --> 22:13.010
YOU WERE JUST STANDING
THERE LIKE A STATUE.

22:13.040 --> 22:14.220
THAT ROOM'S THE ANSWER.

22:14.250 --> 22:14.620
IT HAS TO BE.

22:14.650 --> 22:15.920
IT'S THE ONLY THING
THAT DOESN'T FIT.

22:15.950 --> 22:17.480
IT'S NOT PART
OF THIS REALITY.

22:17.520 --> 22:18.850
IF IT EVEN EXISTS.

22:18.890 --> 22:22.050
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN SEE IT--

22:23.420 --> 22:25.820
I HAVE TO GET BACK THERE.

22:33.410 --> 22:35.240
HEY,PARTNER.

22:38.510 --> 22:40.840
BLACK,TWO SUGARS.

22:45.530 --> 22:46.980
SO THE GUARDS TELL ME

22:47.020 --> 22:49.070
THAT YOU SPENT...

22:50.200 --> 22:53.570
FIVE HOURS HERE YESTERDAY,

22:53.880 --> 22:55.150
THREE THE DAY BEFORE THAT,

22:55.190 --> 22:58.320
AND,ONE SATURDAY,
YOU LOGGED UP 12.

22:58.360 --> 23:00.820
YEAH,SO I LIKE ART.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.720
IT'S A NICE,
FUNCTIONAL DOOR,TOM,

23:02.750 --> 23:05.820
BUT I WOULDN'T CALL IT
A WORK OF ART.

23:08.280 --> 23:11.610
NOW,MAYBE IF IT WERE MADE
OF BLACK OBSIDIAN...

23:12.240 --> 23:15.280
I READ YOUR PSYCH FILE.

23:19.670 --> 23:22.070
YOU PLANNING ON HAVING ME
LOCKED UP AGAIN,DIANA?

23:22.110 --> 23:24.570
YOU KNOW,THIS OTHER REALITY

23:24.610 --> 23:28.310
THAT YOU'RE ANXIOUS
TO GET BACK TO?

23:28.330 --> 23:31.120
I MEAN,EVEN IF YOU COULD
GET BACK TO IT,

23:31.160 --> 23:33.970
IT DOESN'T SOUND
THAT GREAT,TOM.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.500
BACK THERE,
YOU WERE DIVORCED.

23:36.550 --> 23:39.280
HERE,YOU HAVE
A BEAUTIFUL WIFE.

23:39.310 --> 23:41.540
BACK THERE,
YOU SON,KYLE,

23:41.560 --> 23:43.760
SPENT FOUR YEARS
IN A COMA.

23:43.790 --> 23:48.380
HERE,HE'S ABOUT TO SPEND
FOUR IN MEDICAL SCHOOL.

23:48.430 --> 23:52.860
BACK THERE,YOUR SISTER'S FAMILY
IS COMPLETELY DYSFUNCTIONAL,

23:52.900 --> 23:55.670
YOUR NEPHEW IS IN A CULT,

23:55.710 --> 23:58.760
AND THE FUTURE OF THE WORLD
IS IN JEOPARDY.

23:58.920 --> 24:02.270
YOU MAKE IT SOUND SO...BLEAK.

24:02.310 --> 24:04.740
IT'S JUST A...

24:08.600 --> 24:10.920
JUST LIFE.

24:12.920 --> 24:15.240
THIS IS LIFE,

24:15.580 --> 24:20.370
AND IT'S A BETTER LIFE FOR YOU
AND FOR EVERYONE YOU CARE ABOUT.

24:20.410 --> 24:23.040
JUST ACCEPT
WHAT YOU HAVE.

24:23.090 --> 24:25.270
BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T,

24:25.320 --> 24:26.760
WELL,YOU'RE GOING TO SPEND
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE

24:26.800 --> 24:30.300
JUST SITTING IN THIS HALLWAY.

24:43.920 --> 24:45.730
ALANA?

24:46.910 --> 24:48.620
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

24:48.950 --> 24:51.340
HAVE YOU SEEN
THESE PICTURES?

24:51.430 --> 24:54.250
LOOK AT ALL THE THINGS
WE'VE DONE TOGETHER.

24:54.260 --> 24:56.780
YOU KNOW,YOU'D THINK
IF WE'RE TRAPPED HERE,

24:56.800 --> 24:59.810
THEY WOULD GIVE US
THESE MEMORIES.

24:59.990 --> 25:00.960
YOU KNOW?

25:00.990 --> 25:02.280
LOOK,WE'VE BEEN
TO CHINA.

25:02.310 --> 25:04.350
I'VE WANTED TO GO
MY ENTIRE LIFE TO CHINA.

25:04.370 --> 25:06.650
LOOK,ALANA,I DON'T KNOW
HOW LONG IT'S GOING TO TAKE

25:06.680 --> 25:08.490
FOR US TO GET OUT OF HERE.

25:08.510 --> 25:09.240
I DON'T KNOW.

25:09.280 --> 25:11.610
WHO SAYS WE WILL?

25:11.840 --> 25:14.030
YOU KEEP TALKING
ABOUT THAT DOOR.

25:14.070 --> 25:16.480
IT'S BEEN A MONTH ALREADY.

25:16.650 --> 25:17.710
WHAT IF
IT NEVER COMES BACK?

25:17.740 --> 25:19.060
THEN WE'RE TRAPPED,OKAY,
THEN WE'RE TRAPPED.

25:19.090 --> 25:20.490
I DON'T...

25:20.590 --> 25:21.840
BUT IF WE ARE,
ALANA,

25:21.870 --> 25:25.270
I PROMISE YOU,
WE WILL MAKE NEW MEMORIES.

25:25.540 --> 25:28.090
JUST AS GOOD AS THESE.

25:29.520 --> 25:31.430
BETTER.

25:44.410 --> 25:47.200
OH,I BELIEVE WE COULD,THOMAS.

25:49.300 --> 25:52.170
I LIKE IT
WHEN YOU CALL ME THAT.

25:53.720 --> 25:55.630
"THOMAS."

26:22.090 --> 26:23.870
AND THIS GOES UP,AND THEN...

26:23.900 --> 26:25.770
UGH,I CAN NEVER GET
THESE THINGS RIGHT.

26:25.800 --> 26:27.200
LET ME TAKE A SHOT.

26:27.540 --> 26:30.580
COME HERE. HOLD STILL.

26:30.610 --> 26:32.530
YOU GOT TO REMEMBER
TO MAKE BIG LOOPS.

26:32.560 --> 26:35.600
LEAVE YOURSELF
A LITTLE ROOM TO WORK WITH.

26:37.150 --> 26:38.540
HANDS
OF A SURGEON.

26:38.570 --> 26:39.960
HANDS OF A RESIDENT,
MORE LIKE.

26:39.990 --> 26:41.470
NO,YOU'LL GET THERE.

26:41.510 --> 26:43.220
SO HOW DO YOU LIKE IT
OVER AT ST. BEDE'S?

26:43.250 --> 26:44.160
THE HOURS ARE KILLER.

26:44.190 --> 26:46.550
DOCTORS TREAT ME LIKE
A GLORIFIED CANDYSTRIPER.

26:46.570 --> 26:48.170
A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP
IS A DISTANT MEMORY.

26:48.220 --> 26:49.780
I LOVE IT.

26:50.480 --> 26:51.890
WELL,I LOOK
LIKE I BELONG

26:51.910 --> 26:54.100
ON TOP
OF A WEDDING CAKE.

26:54.500 --> 26:55.590
HEY,YOU BROUGHT THIS
ON YOURSELF.

26:55.630 --> 26:58.190
SOME PEOPLE GO TO FIJI
FOR THEIR 10th ANNIVERSARY.

26:58.220 --> 26:59.860
YOU TWO WANTED
TO RENEW YOUR VOWS.

26:59.900 --> 27:00.840
YEAH,WELL,
THE FIRST TIME

27:00.870 --> 27:02.410
JUST FELT LIKE
PICTURES IN A BOOK.

27:02.450 --> 27:04.340
THIS ONE...

27:04.380 --> 27:07.600
THIS ONE IS FOR ME AND ALANA.

27:07.630 --> 27:09.390
READY TO GO,CHAMP?

27:09.420 --> 27:11.800
AND DO YOU,
ALANA BALDWIN,

27:11.840 --> 27:15.200
ALSO RENEW YOUR
COMMITMENTS TO HONOR,OBEY,

27:15.220 --> 27:16.820
AND LOVE
YOUR HUSBAND,THOMAS,

27:16.870 --> 27:18.760
TILL DEATH
DO YOU PART?

27:18.790 --> 27:20.530
I DO.

27:20.560 --> 27:22.130
THEN BY THE POWER
VESTED IN ME,

27:22.170 --> 27:25.570
I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU
STILL MAN AND WIFE.

27:28.800 --> 27:31.710
GO AHEAD.YOU MAY KISS
YOUR BEAUTIFUL BRIDE.

27:47.130 --> 27:48.960
I'M GETTING IN HERE.

27:48.990 --> 27:51.350
OH,I LOVE YOU GUYS.

27:51.710 --> 27:55.230
SO HOW DO YOU FEEL,
MRS. BALDWIN?

27:55.280 --> 27:57.610
MARRIED. FINALLY.

27:58.580 --> 28:00.830
FEELS REAL NOW,HUH?

28:00.870 --> 28:03.800
WELL,IT FELT REAL
FOR A LONG TIME.

28:03.820 --> 28:06.460
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE
WE RESISTED IT.

28:11.960 --> 28:14.940
DO YOU MISS IT?
YOUR OLD LIFE?

28:14.990 --> 28:17.140
I STILL THINK ABOUT IT,

28:17.170 --> 28:18.410
BUT AFTER
ALL THESE YEARS,

28:18.440 --> 28:20.660
THAT LIFE,THAT WORLD--

28:20.700 --> 28:22.760
THAT FEELS
LIKE THE DELUSION.

28:22.790 --> 28:24.110
I KNOW.
I HAVE TO CONCENTRATE

28:24.140 --> 28:27.360
TO EVEN REMEMBER
A LIFE WITHOUT YOU.

28:27.630 --> 28:28.880
SEE,I'M GOOD THAT WAY.

28:28.920 --> 28:31.080
LIKE A CELLPHONE
OR TIVO.

28:31.110 --> 28:31.890
ONCE YOU'VE GOT ME,

28:31.920 --> 28:34.380
YOU CAN'T IMAGINE
NOT HAVING ME.

28:35.690 --> 28:38.050
I LOVE YOU,THOMAS.

28:38.110 --> 28:41.040
IT STILL KILLS ME
WHEN YOU CALL ME THAT.

28:41.100 --> 28:43.070
COME HERE,WOMAN.

28:49.670 --> 28:51.220
YOU'RE RESIGNING?

28:51.260 --> 28:53.290
I'M MOVING ON,TOM.

28:53.310 --> 28:55.420
I'VE BEEN HERE
11 YEARS.

28:55.440 --> 28:57.380
THE PRIVATE SECTOR BECKONS.

28:57.410 --> 28:58.700
DENNIS RYLAND
OFFERED ME

28:58.740 --> 29:01.360
A PARTNERSHIP
IN HIS CONSULTING FIRM.

29:01.530 --> 29:02.840
NICE GIG.

29:02.900 --> 29:04.270
SO YOU'RE MOVING TO VIRGINIA?

29:04.290 --> 29:05.650
THREE WEEKS.

29:05.920 --> 29:08.600
LOOK,D.C. HAS ASKED ME
TO SUBMIT A LIST OF NAMES

29:08.630 --> 29:10.210
AS POTENTIAL REPLACEMENTS.

29:10.260 --> 29:12.290
I'M GIVING THEM ONE.

29:13.140 --> 29:14.760
YOURS.

29:21.680 --> 29:24.070
WELL,I'M-- I'M FLATTERED.
I,UH...

29:24.100 --> 29:25.380
BUT YOU MIGHT NEED
A BACKUP OR TWO.

29:25.420 --> 29:27.790
I MEAN,
SOMEWHERE IN MY PERSONNEL FILE

29:27.810 --> 29:29.850
ARE MEASUREMENTS
FOR MY STRAITJACKET.

29:29.880 --> 29:30.970
NAH,YOU WERE
CONVALESCING

29:31.020 --> 29:32.730
FROM INJURIES
RECEIVED IN THE LINE OF DUTY.

29:32.760 --> 29:34.350
YOUR SERVICE IN THAT CASE
WAS HEROIC.

29:34.380 --> 29:37.830
I THINK YOU CAN TALK YOUR
WAY AROUND THE FALLOUT.

29:37.890 --> 29:40.040
THAT IS,IF YOU WANT THE JOB.

29:42.940 --> 29:43.990
A CHANCE TO SIT
IN THE BIG CHAIR?

29:46.470 --> 29:47.370
I WANT IT,ALL RIGHT.

29:47.400 --> 29:47.990
GOOD.

29:48.010 --> 29:51.010
THEN PRACTICE SAYING,
"NICE TO MEET YOU TOO,SENATOR."

29:51.040 --> 29:54.040
BEST WAY TO PREP FOR
YOUR CONFIRMATION HEARING.

29:54.260 --> 29:56.340
I'LL SPRING
FOR A NEW SUIT.

29:56.720 --> 29:58.120
MY LAST ACT
AS HEAD OF THIS DIVISION

29:58.140 --> 30:00.950
WILL BE TO MAKE SURE
THAT THIS HAPPENS.

30:01.010 --> 30:03.230
CONGRATULATIONS,TOM.

30:03.260 --> 30:04.630
YOU'VE EARNED THIS.

30:04.670 --> 30:06.270
THANK YOU.

30:11.150 --> 30:11.950
GUESS WHAT.

30:11.980 --> 30:13.390
DON'T TELL ME.

30:13.430 --> 30:15.720
YOU JUST SPOKE TO JARVIS.

30:15.760 --> 30:16.520
YOU KNEW?

30:17.160 --> 30:18.240
SHE MIGHT HAVE
MENTIONED SOMETHING.

30:18.290 --> 30:19.700
AND YOU DIDN'T
TELL ME?

30:19.740 --> 30:20.980
I'M TRANSFERRING YOU
TO GREENLAND.

30:21.050 --> 30:23.120
OH,LOOK,
HE'S NOT EVEN CONFIRMED YET,

30:23.150 --> 30:25.140
AND HE'S MAD WITH POWER.

30:27.600 --> 30:28.330
BALDWIN.

30:28.350 --> 30:30.100
HEY,YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO BELIEVE THIS.

30:30.100 --> 30:32.060
THEY'VE JUST ASKED ME
TO JOIN THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

30:32.090 --> 30:33.590
AT THE COLLIER MUSEUM.

30:33.620 --> 30:35.260
WOW. THAT'S...QUITE AN HONOR.

30:35.530 --> 30:37.010
DO YOU THINK I SHOULD TAKE IT?

30:37.050 --> 30:38.170
THE BEST MUSEUM
ON THE WEST COAST.

30:38.190 --> 30:39.340
YOU GOT TO TAKE IT.

30:39.390 --> 30:40.240
THERE'S A BENEFIT

30:40.270 --> 30:44.430
AT THE SEATTLE INNER CITY
ARTS COUNCIL ON FRIDAY NIGHT.

30:44.460 --> 30:46.000
THEY WANT
TO INTRODUCE ME AROUND.

30:46.030 --> 30:48.860
I DIDN'T PUT MY TUX
BACK INTO STORAGE.

30:48.880 --> 30:49.870
SO IT,UM...

30:49.890 --> 30:52.910
LOOKS LIKE WE BOTH GOT A LITTLE
SURPRISE AT THE OFFICE TODAY.

30:52.950 --> 30:54.170
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

30:54.190 --> 30:55.840
ARE YOU SITTING DOWN?

30:57.320 --> 30:58.800
JUST TELL ME,THOMAS.

30:58.830 --> 31:01.470
HONEY,I'LL SEE YOU
AT HOME TONIGHT.

31:02.080 --> 31:03.610
GLENDON RITTER,

31:03.670 --> 31:07.380
C.E.O.
OF STRADWICK PHARMACEUTICALS.

31:07.420 --> 31:09.370
ISN'T HE PRESIDENT
OF THE ARTS COUNCIL?

31:09.420 --> 31:10.990
WELL,YOU SHOULD GO
SAY HELLO.

31:11.020 --> 31:11.630
YOU COME WITH.

31:11.660 --> 31:13.560
NO,NO,YOU...
YOU GO.

31:13.600 --> 31:15.670
I'M ALL OUT
OF SMALL TALK.

31:15.700 --> 31:17.200
GO AHEAD.

31:21.510 --> 31:22.640
MR. RITTER.

31:22.670 --> 31:24.800
SO HAPPY
YOU COULD MAKE IT.

31:39.480 --> 31:41.300
THOMAS?

31:47.050 --> 31:48.550
DO YOU SEE IT?

31:53.100 --> 31:54.650
NO.

31:55.200 --> 31:57.100
WHY? YOU DO?

31:57.160 --> 31:59.830
IT'S BEEN GONE
FOR EIGHT YEARS.

31:59.850 --> 32:01.400
WHY NOW?

32:02.950 --> 32:04.990
COME BACK DOWNSTAIRS WITH ME.

32:05.020 --> 32:07.470
THAT'S THE WAY OUT. IT...

32:07.500 --> 32:08.570
IT HAS TO BE.

32:08.600 --> 32:10.570
AND IF IT IS...

32:10.610 --> 32:13.240
AND YOU WALK THROUGH IT...

32:13.300 --> 32:15.250
WHAT HAPPENS
TO ALL OF THIS?

32:15.270 --> 32:17.380
TO US?

32:17.750 --> 32:20.460
I DON'T KNOW.

32:23.040 --> 32:25.990
AND I DON'T WANT TO FIND OUT.

32:26.970 --> 32:29.490
I WANT TO GO TO WASHINGTON
NEXT MONTH,

32:29.530 --> 32:32.850
AND I WANT TO WATCH YOU
GET PROMOTED.

32:32.890 --> 32:34.800
I WANT TO SEE WHO KYLE MARRIES.

32:34.830 --> 32:37.080
SO DO I...

32:38.780 --> 32:41.760
BUT THIS DOOR,IT'S...

32:41.800 --> 32:44.470
IT'S BACK FOR A REASON.

32:45.490 --> 32:47.390
IT'S LIKE
IT WANTS ME TO WALK THROUGH IT.

32:47.430 --> 32:50.460
BUT DO YOU WANT
TO WALK THROUGH IT?

32:54.500 --> 32:57.520
I DON'T WANT YOU TO,EITHER.

32:57.580 --> 32:58.970
COME ON,THOMAS.

32:59.000 --> 33:01.030
LET'S GO HOME.

33:39.190 --> 33:39.900
KYLE!

33:39.930 --> 33:41.320
NO,KYLE'S MY SON!

33:41.350 --> 33:42.920
LEAVE ME ALONE! HE'S MY SON!

33:42.960 --> 33:43.800
KYLE!

33:43.840 --> 33:45.840
STOP.
LET GO OF ME!

34:48.219 --> 34:50.300
WHAT...

34:52.710 --> 34:54.550
CONGRATULATIONS.

34:54.570 --> 34:56.800
YOU MADE IT.

35:05.420 --> 35:07.530
WHERE ARE WE?

35:07.570 --> 35:09.790
I THINK YOU KNOW.

35:09.850 --> 35:12.380
THIS IS WHERE
THEY BROUGHT YOU...

35:14.610 --> 35:16.910
AND THE REST OF THE 4400.

35:16.940 --> 35:19.940
YES,THIS IS WHERE
THEY ALTERED US--

35:19.990 --> 35:20.970
GAVE ME THE ABILITY

35:21.020 --> 35:22.690
TO CREATE THE WORLD
WE'VE BEEN LIVING IN

35:22.730 --> 35:25.310
FOR THE LAST EIGHT YEARS.

35:26.300 --> 35:28.640
SO IT IS YOU.

35:29.690 --> 35:31.370
YOU'VE BEEN DOING THIS
THE WHOLE TIME.

35:31.420 --> 35:33.660
WE'VE BEEN LIVING
IN MY MIND,

35:33.930 --> 35:36.110
BUT THE INSTRUCTIONS
FOR YOUR REALITY

35:36.140 --> 35:38.580
CAME FROM THEM.

35:38.660 --> 35:41.130
THEY CREATED
A SANCTUARY FOR YOU,

35:41.170 --> 35:44.880
AN EASIER,
LESS COMPLICATED WORLD.

35:45.000 --> 35:46.470
BUT NONE OF IT'S REAL.

35:46.520 --> 35:47.170
YOU ARE.

35:47.220 --> 35:48.650
I AM.

35:49.420 --> 35:51.270
THE FEELINGS
WE HAVE FOR EACH OTHER ARE

35:51.300 --> 35:53.860
AS REAL AS ANYTHING
WE'VE EVER EXPERIENCED.

35:53.890 --> 35:56.260
IS THAT WHY THEY DID THIS?

35:56.910 --> 35:57.920
KEPT US HERE FOR EIGHT YEARS?

35:57.950 --> 36:00.970
BECAUSE THEY WANTED US
TO FALL IN LOVE?

36:04.160 --> 36:06.090
MOMENTS.

36:06.260 --> 36:08.240
THAT'S ALL THAT'S PASSED,

36:08.280 --> 36:09.510
BUT IN THOSE
FEW SECONDS,

36:09.540 --> 36:13.310
WE'VE ACCUMULATED
YEARS OF MEMORIES

36:13.350 --> 36:16.100
THAT WILL BOND US
IN THE REAL WORLD.

36:16.130 --> 36:18.350
I THOUGHT THEY WERE WORRIED
ABOUT SAVING THE WORLD,

36:18.380 --> 36:20.270
NOT PLAYING MATCHMAKER.

36:20.310 --> 36:22.040
THEY'RE WORRIED
ABOUT YOU.

36:22.070 --> 36:25.030
YOUR LIFE
IS ABOUT TO PLUNGE INTO CRISIS.

36:25.080 --> 36:26.410
YOUR MISSION
WILL BE THREATENED.

36:26.440 --> 36:28.850
THEY CAN'T ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN.

36:28.880 --> 36:32.280
THEY GAVE YOU THIS RELATIONSHIP
AS A SOURCE OF STRENGTH,

36:32.310 --> 36:33.230
TO SUSTAIN YOU

36:33.250 --> 36:35.450
IN THE TRIALS
THAT LAY AHEAD.

36:35.480 --> 36:37.070
WHAT CRISIS? WHAT--

36:37.100 --> 36:38.450
WHAT IS IT?

36:38.500 --> 36:40.260
WHY CAN'T THEY JUST TELL ME
WHAT IT IS?

36:40.280 --> 36:41.640
I CAN STOP IT FROM HAPPENING.

36:41.690 --> 36:43.820
IT'S ALREADY BEGUN...

36:45.300 --> 36:47.430
BUT NOW YOU WON'T HAVE TO
FACE IT ALONE.

36:47.460 --> 36:49.260
NO,IF IT'S STARTED,
I HAVE TO GET BACK THERE.

36:49.300 --> 36:52.550
ONLY YOUR WIFE
CAN GET YOU HOME.

36:57.200 --> 36:58.600
YOU ARE MY WIFE.

36:59.070 --> 37:00.400
NO.

37:00.520 --> 37:03.330
I'M PART OF THE PROGRAM
THEY PLACED IN HER MIND.

37:03.360 --> 37:06.000
SHE HAS NO IDEA
SHE'S CREATING THIS.

37:06.050 --> 37:06.740
IF SHE DID,

37:06.780 --> 37:08.500
IT WOULD INTERFERE
WITH THE BONDING.

37:08.540 --> 37:09.960
SO,WHAT,I'M SUPPOSED
TO JUST FILL HER IN

37:10.020 --> 37:11.100
AND TELL HER WHAT?

37:11.140 --> 37:12.750
WHETHER SHE KNOWS IT OR NOT,

37:12.800 --> 37:15.860
SHE'S WILLING THIS WORLD
INTO EXISTENCE.

37:15.920 --> 37:18.800
SHE CAN WILL IT
OUT OF EXISTENCE.

37:18.820 --> 37:20.640
YEAH,AND WHAT IF
SHE DOESN'T WANT TO?

37:20.680 --> 37:22.620
YOU HAVE TO
CONVINCE HER.

37:22.660 --> 37:26.390
THAT WILL BE THE FIRST TEST
OF YOUR RELATIONSHIP.

37:32.230 --> 37:35.640
THEY'VE CREATED A DAMN NEAR
PERFECT WORLD FOR ME.

37:38.650 --> 37:41.250
WHAT IF I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE?

37:43.070 --> 37:46.270
THEN THE FUTURE
PICKED THE WRONG MAN.

37:55.450 --> 37:56.500
WHAT ABOUT KYLE?

37:56.520 --> 37:58.490
HE SPENT NINE YEARS
BECOMING A DOCTOR.

37:58.530 --> 37:59.840
WHAT,AM I SUPPOSED
TO GET RID OF HIM?

37:59.870 --> 38:00.890
WISH HIM AWAY?

38:00.930 --> 38:01.830
IT'S NOT REALLY KYLE.

38:01.870 --> 38:03.040
DON'T SAY THAT!

38:03.070 --> 38:03.910
IF IT'S NOT KYLE,

38:03.930 --> 38:05.410
WHO'S MOVING AROUND
DOWNSTAIRS IN THE KITCHEN?

38:05.440 --> 38:06.980
KYLE. SHAWN. DANNY.

38:07.010 --> 38:08.610
NONE OF THEM ARE REAL.
THEY'RE JUST PROJECTIONS.

38:08.650 --> 38:10.560
YOU'VE SPENT EIGHT YEARS
WITH THESE PEOPLE.

38:10.600 --> 38:12.180
THEY'RE AS REAL TO YOU
AS THEY ARE TO ME.

38:12.210 --> 38:13.870
I LOVE MY FAMILY.

38:13.910 --> 38:15.460
I REALLY DO LOVE THEM.

38:15.490 --> 38:17.290
IT'S NOT THAT I WANT TO DO THIS.

38:17.320 --> 38:18.620
IT'S THAT WE HAVE TO DO IT.

38:18.650 --> 38:20.220
BUT THEY'RE MY FAMILY,TOO.

38:20.250 --> 38:24.100
BACK THERE,
I'M JUST A STRANGER TO THEM.

38:24.220 --> 38:26.440
WHAT ABOUT YOU AND ME?
OUR LIFE?

38:26.480 --> 38:27.750
IS THAT A PROJECTION,TOO?

38:27.780 --> 38:28.160
NO.

38:28.200 --> 38:29.880
WHAT WE HAVE,OUR MEMORIES,

38:29.920 --> 38:31.700
THEY'LL CARRY OVER
INTO THE REAL WORLD.

38:31.720 --> 38:34.230
BUT IT WON'T BE THE SAME.
IT CAN'T BE.

38:34.260 --> 38:35.630
MAYBE NOT,

38:35.660 --> 38:38.910
BUT WHATEVER WE HAVE,
IT'LL BE REAL.

38:41.270 --> 38:43.280
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

38:46.320 --> 38:48.390
MAKE IT GO AWAY.

38:48.430 --> 38:51.140
WHAT DO I DO?
STARE AT IT UNTIL IT DISAPPEARS?

38:51.200 --> 38:54.740
NO,JUST BELIEVE
IT'S NOT THERE.

39:10.940 --> 39:13.170
WELL,THANKS
FOR COMING,EVERYBODY.

39:13.210 --> 39:16.260
ALANA AND I JUST WANTED
TO TELL YOU ALL THAT...

39:16.540 --> 39:18.950
WE'RE GOING TO BE
LEAVING.

39:19.280 --> 39:20.820
WE'RE TAKING
A VACATION.

39:20.870 --> 39:23.390
WE'LL BE GONE
FOR A WHILE,AND,UH...

39:23.450 --> 39:24.130
I KNOW IT'S SUDDEN,

39:24.190 --> 39:25.400
BUT WE JUST DECIDED
THIS MORNING.

39:25.430 --> 39:26.390
WELL,
HOW LONG IS A WHILE?

39:26.420 --> 39:29.590
I MEAN,YOU JUST GOT THE BIGGEST
PROMOTION OF YOUR CAREER.

39:29.620 --> 39:31.640
IT'LL HAVE TO WAIT.

39:31.670 --> 39:35.640
WE WANTED TO SEE YOU ALL
ONE LAST TIME BEFORE WE GO,

39:35.690 --> 39:38.000
AND TELL YOU...

39:38.030 --> 39:40.810
HOW MUCH WE LOVE YOU.

39:40.900 --> 39:42.880
THAT'S SO SWEET.

39:42.940 --> 39:43.520
CAREFUL,ALANA.

39:43.550 --> 39:46.500
SHE'S GOING TO BE CRYING
IN A SECOND.

39:47.630 --> 39:48.910
IT'S SOMETHING
WE HAVE TO DO.

39:48.940 --> 39:50.520
IT'S A...

39:50.580 --> 39:53.640
IT'S A TRIP THAT WE'VE BEEN
TALKING ABOUT FOR A LONG TIME.

39:53.680 --> 39:56.260
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

39:58.060 --> 39:58.920
NOT FAR.

39:58.980 --> 40:00.300
WELL...

40:00.330 --> 40:01.590
SEND US A POSTCARD...

40:01.620 --> 40:03.390
AT LEAST.

40:07.630 --> 40:10.200
TO THE PEOPLE WE LOVE.

40:12.420 --> 40:15.860
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW MUCH WE WILL MISS YOU.

40:16.720 --> 40:19.300
WE WILL MISS YOU,TOO.

40:57.920 --> 41:00.330
DON'T LOOK BACK.

41:07.550 --> 41:08.790
TOM?

41:08.910 --> 41:10.620
TOM?

41:10.700 --> 41:12.900
ARE YOU WITH ME,TOM?

41:12.970 --> 41:16.020
CAN YOU EMAIL ME
THE MAREVA FILE?

41:17.050 --> 41:17.880
ALANA MAREVA?

41:17.930 --> 41:20.150
YEAH,A.K.A. RETURNEE 2155.

41:20.170 --> 41:21.980
SHE WAS JUST HERE
DOING HER MED EVAL.

41:22.000 --> 41:23.370
IT'S MY WEEK
TO DO REPORTS,

41:23.400 --> 41:24.920
REMEMBER?

41:25.200 --> 41:27.010
DIANA,THE 4400,
THE BALL OF LIGHT,

41:27.040 --> 41:28.000

41:28.030 --> 41:28.990
SHOULD I BE WORRIED ABOUT YOU--

41:29.030 --> 41:31.320
- JUST TELL ME IT HAPPENED.
- YES,OF COURSE IT HAPPENED.

41:31.350 --> 41:33.050
WHAT ELSE HAVE WE BEEN
DOING HERE THE LAST YEAR?

41:33.090 --> 41:34.740
THAT'S GREAT.
