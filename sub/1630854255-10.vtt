WEBVTT

02:29.649 --> 02:31.484
There you are.

02:41.202 --> 02:44.122
The Sea Snake is going to die,
isn't he?

02:47.000 --> 02:50.086
-Luke--
-I can't be Lord of the Tides.

02:50.169 --> 02:52.755
Grandsire was the greatest sailor
who ever lived.

02:52.839 --> 02:55.633
I get greensick before the ship
even leaves the harbor.

02:56.426 --> 02:58.344
I'll just ruin everything.

02:59.387 --> 03:00.930
I don't want Driftmark.

03:01.806 --> 03:03.391
It should've passed on to Ser Vaemond.

03:03.474 --> 03:06.644
We don't choose our destiny, Luke.
It chooses us.

03:06.728 --> 03:09.647
Grandsire let you choose
whether you'd be his heir.

03:10.690 --> 03:11.816
You told us so.

03:16.446 --> 03:19.991
And do you want to know the truth of it?

03:22.118 --> 03:23.661
I was frightened.

03:25.163 --> 03:28.541
I was four-and-ten.

03:28.625 --> 03:30.168
Same as you are now.

03:30.919 --> 03:35.298
I wasn't ready
to be Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.

03:35.381 --> 03:38.593
But it was my duty.

03:38.676 --> 03:41.220
And, in time, I came to understand

03:41.304 --> 03:43.514
I had to earn my inheritance.

03:45.308 --> 03:46.976
I'm not like you.

03:47.060 --> 03:49.979
-In what way, sweet boy?
-I'm not so...

03:52.148 --> 03:53.066
perfect.

04:03.159 --> 04:06.371
I am anything but.

04:06.454 --> 04:10.375
My father looked after me
and helped to prepare me for my duties.

04:10.458 --> 04:13.503
Your mother will do the same for you.

04:14.420 --> 04:16.005
Good morrow, Princess.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.632
Good morrow, Ser Lorent.

04:18.883 --> 04:21.469
Princess Rhaenys
has just arrived on dragonback.

04:21.552 --> 04:25.098
She urgently requests an audience
with you and Prince Daemon.

04:42.657 --> 04:44.909
The Princess Rhaenys Targaryen.

04:44.993 --> 04:46.494
Thank you, Ser Lorent.

04:50.456 --> 04:52.250
Princess Rhaenys,

04:52.333 --> 04:55.044
might we hope for news
of Lord Corlys's recovery?

04:55.128 --> 04:57.005
Viserys is dead.

05:02.844 --> 05:05.513
I grieve this loss with you, Rhaenyra.

05:05.596 --> 05:08.725
My cousin, your father...

05:10.184 --> 05:12.103
possessed a kind heart.

05:22.947 --> 05:24.115
There is more.

05:26.117 --> 05:29.037
Aegon has been crowned as his successor.

05:35.585 --> 05:37.503
They crowned him?

05:39.047 --> 05:41.424
How did Viserys die?

05:41.507 --> 05:43.176
I could not say.

05:43.843 --> 05:45.887
-How long ago?
-A day past, perhaps two.

05:45.970 --> 05:48.806
I was made a prisoner in my quarters
while the Queen made her preparations.

05:48.890 --> 05:50.058
Viserys has been slain.

05:52.018 --> 05:56.564
Alicent demanded you declare for Aegon.

05:57.940 --> 05:59.067
She did.

06:01.778 --> 06:04.697
-I refused her.
-And yet you are alive.

06:07.533 --> 06:11.120
The High Septon crowned Aegon
in the Dragonpit.

06:11.204 --> 06:14.290
I witnessed it myself
just before I fled on Meleys.

06:14.373 --> 06:17.710
They crowned him before the masses.

06:17.794 --> 06:20.046
So that the masses would see him
as their rightful king.

06:20.129 --> 06:23.382
That whore of a Queen murdered my brother
and stole his throne.

06:23.466 --> 06:24.967
And you could have burned them all for it.

06:26.052 --> 06:29.180
A war is like to be fought
over this treachery, to be sure.

06:33.226 --> 06:36.187
But that war is not mine to begin.

06:36.270 --> 06:38.064
I only rushed this warning to you

06:38.147 --> 06:40.691
out of loyalty to my husband
and to my house.

06:42.944 --> 06:44.904
The Greens are coming for you, Rhaenyra.

06:46.197 --> 06:48.116
And for your children.

06:49.408 --> 06:51.285
You should leave Dragonstone at once.

07:11.931 --> 07:13.432
The babe is coming.

07:21.149 --> 07:22.942
Her term is far from complete.

07:23.025 --> 07:24.652
This should not be happening.

07:24.735 --> 07:27.280
It is fucking happening.

07:28.656 --> 07:31.784
Keep your head about you, Princess.
Come.

07:32.368 --> 07:34.954
We've done this five times before.

07:35.037 --> 07:37.456
Keep your spirit,
and the sixth will be no different.

07:37.540 --> 07:39.959
Get off, get off, get off, get off!

07:40.042 --> 07:42.753
Ow, ow, ow.

07:46.174 --> 07:47.967
I want patrols along
the island's perimeter,

07:48.050 --> 07:50.344
looking for any small ships
that might set ashore.

07:51.596 --> 07:53.764
If the Greens attack now,
it will be by stealth...

07:53.848 --> 07:55.850
not directly.

07:55.933 --> 07:57.768
We don't have enough men
to surround the island,

07:57.852 --> 08:00.354
but we can make ourselves
appear stronger than they are.

08:04.025 --> 08:06.319
Conscript the Dragonkeepers.
They're capable fighters.

08:06.402 --> 08:08.738
-Waste no time.
-It will be done, my Prince.

08:20.917 --> 08:24.337
-What was that?
- I'm sorry.

08:25.046 --> 08:27.006
You might go easier

08:27.089 --> 08:28.758
on him, my Prince,

08:28.841 --> 08:31.177
so he can learn what
you're trying to teach.

08:31.260 --> 08:33.763
Your lady mother needs to see you!

08:35.681 --> 08:37.433
Both of you.

08:38.684 --> 08:40.144
Mother?

08:43.272 --> 08:44.815
Fuck.

08:47.151 --> 08:48.694
Princess.

08:59.747 --> 09:02.041
Your grandsire, King Viserys, has passed.

09:02.124 --> 09:03.501
Viserys?

09:03.584 --> 09:06.462
The Greens have
repudiated the succession

09:06.545 --> 09:08.172
and claimed the Iron Throne.

09:12.385 --> 09:14.053
Aegon has been crowned king.

09:15.596 --> 09:18.307
-What is to be done about it?
-Nothing yet.

09:18.391 --> 09:21.060
-And where is Daemon?
-I don't know.

09:21.143 --> 09:22.645
Gone to madness.

09:24.814 --> 09:26.065
Gone to plot his war.

09:27.567 --> 09:30.111
-Leave Daemon with me.
-Jace.

09:31.070 --> 09:32.071
Jacaerys.

09:37.827 --> 09:41.455
Whatever claim remains to me,
you are now its heir.

09:41.539 --> 09:44.542
Naught is to be done but by my command.

09:59.557 --> 10:00.933
A raven flew in this morning.

10:01.017 --> 10:04.353
The Sea Snake's fever has broken,
and he has left Evenfall.

10:04.437 --> 10:07.356
-Where is he sailing?
-That much is unclear, my Prince.

10:07.982 --> 10:09.775
We'll send ravens to our nearest allies:

10:09.859 --> 10:12.278
Lords Darklyn, Massey...

10:13.154 --> 10:15.489
-and Bar Emmon.
-Daemon!

10:16.324 --> 10:18.659
Do you want to speak
to the maester, my Prince?

10:27.335 --> 10:30.171
I'll fly to the Riverlands myself
and affirm Lord Tully's support.

10:30.254 --> 10:31.797
You will do no such thing.

10:34.592 --> 10:37.553
My mother has decreed no action be taken
while she's abed.

10:43.976 --> 10:47.355
It's good you're here, young Prince.

10:47.438 --> 10:49.523
You're needed to patrol
the skies on Vermax.

10:49.607 --> 10:50.941
Did you hear what I said?

10:55.196 --> 10:56.530
The ravens, Lord Bartimos.

10:58.949 --> 11:00.117
I shall see it done.

11:00.201 --> 11:01.702
Summon Ser Steffon.

11:01.786 --> 11:04.330
Our Kingsguard are needed
on the Dragonmont.

11:05.039 --> 11:07.958
Come with me.
I'll show you the true meaning of loyalty.

11:15.674 --> 11:18.260
You swore an oath
as knights of the Kingsguard.

11:18.344 --> 11:20.888
As do all who wear
the white cloak, my Prince.

11:22.390 --> 11:23.516
To whom?

11:24.809 --> 11:28.646
I swore first to King Jaehaerys,
my Prince.

11:28.729 --> 11:29.939
And then to His Grace,

11:30.022 --> 11:32.233
King Viserys, when he succeeded him.

11:32.316 --> 11:34.402
Do you acknowledge
the true line of succession?

11:35.277 --> 11:36.987
-Yes.
-Yes, my Prince.

11:43.702 --> 11:45.746
Do you recall

11:45.830 --> 11:49.333
who King Viserys named
as his heir before his death?

11:51.919 --> 11:53.462
Princess Rhaenyra.

11:57.758 --> 12:00.678
I'm grateful for
your long service to the crown.

12:02.430 --> 12:04.306
So I'm presenting you with a choice.

12:27.746 --> 12:30.291
Swear anew your oath
to Rhaenyra as your queen...

12:31.792 --> 12:35.087
to Prince Jacaerys as the heir
to the Iron Throne.

12:40.134 --> 12:41.135
Or...

12:41.218 --> 12:43.596
if you support the usurper,
speak it now...

12:45.264 --> 12:47.600
and you will have a clean
and honorable death.

12:48.809 --> 12:51.145
But if you choose treachery,

12:51.228 --> 12:54.732
if you swear fealty now
only to later turn your cloaks...

12:57.485 --> 13:00.362
know that you will die

13:00.446 --> 13:01.322
screaming.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.538
Princess, let us help you.

13:12.041 --> 13:13.959
No.

13:16.337 --> 13:19.089
- Get out!
-Princess, please.

13:19.173 --> 13:20.925
-Get out.
-You should not do this alone, Princess.

13:21.008 --> 13:22.051
Let us help you.

16:47.297 --> 16:49.842
I mean no harm, brothers.

17:12.406 --> 17:14.158
I swear to ward the Queen...

17:16.994 --> 17:18.537
with all my strength...

17:19.955 --> 17:22.624
and give my blood for hers.

17:27.713 --> 17:29.631
I shall take no wife...

17:31.341 --> 17:32.718
hold no lands...

17:34.178 --> 17:36.472
father no children.

17:36.555 --> 17:38.724
I shall guard her secrets...

17:39.600 --> 17:41.351
obey her commands...

17:42.478 --> 17:46.023
ride at her side, and defend her name
and honor.

18:12.424 --> 18:13.842
My Queen.

19:56.069 --> 19:59.948
Queen Rhaenyra Targaryen,
First of Her Name,

20:00.032 --> 20:02.951
Queen of the Andals and the Rhoynar
and the First Men.

20:04.119 --> 20:07.664
Lady of the Seven Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm.

20:11.335 --> 20:12.836
Your Grace.

20:21.428 --> 20:23.347
Wine, my Queen.

20:26.183 --> 20:27.517
Thank you, Rhaena.

20:28.560 --> 20:29.645
Come.

20:54.086 --> 20:56.046
-What is our standing?
-We have 30 knights,

20:56.129 --> 20:58.715
a hundred crossbowmen,
and 300 men-at-arms.

20:58.799 --> 21:02.052
Dragonstone is relatively easy to defend,
but as an instrument of conquest,

21:02.135 --> 21:04.388
our army leaves a lot to be desired.

21:04.471 --> 21:06.640
We have sent word to my loyal men
in the City Watch.

21:06.723 --> 21:09.226
I'll have some support there,
but I cannot speak to the numbers.

21:09.309 --> 21:12.813
We already have declarations
from Celtigar and Staunton,

21:12.896 --> 21:15.440
Massey, Darklyn, Bar Emmon.

21:18.110 --> 21:20.195
My lady mother was an Arryn.

21:20.278 --> 21:22.572
The Vale will not turn cloak
against their own kin.

21:22.656 --> 21:26.159
Riverrun was always a close friend
to your father, Your Grace.

21:26.243 --> 21:27.786
With Prince Daemon's acquiescence,

21:27.869 --> 21:30.288
I've already sent ravens to Lord Grover.

21:34.209 --> 21:36.461
Lord Grover is fickle and easily swayed.

21:36.545 --> 21:38.922
He will need to be convinced
of the strength of our position

21:39.006 --> 21:41.800
and that we will support him
should it come to war.

21:41.883 --> 21:43.927
I'm going to treat with him myself.

21:44.011 --> 21:45.721
What of Storm's End and Winterfell?

21:45.804 --> 21:48.390
There has never
lived a Stark who forgot an oath.

21:48.473 --> 21:51.226
And with House Stark,
the North will follow.

21:51.309 --> 21:54.896
Lord Borros Baratheon will need
to be reminded of his father's promises.

22:08.035 --> 22:09.953
What news from Driftmark?

22:12.748 --> 22:14.708
Lord Corlys sails for Dragonstone.

22:14.791 --> 22:17.085
To declare for his Queen.

22:18.420 --> 22:21.381
The Velaryon fleet
is in my husband's yoke.

22:21.465 --> 22:23.341
He decides where they sail.

22:23.425 --> 22:26.720
We shall pray for both you
and your husband's support.

22:26.803 --> 22:29.806
Just as we prayed nightly
for the Sea Snake's return to good health.

22:31.516 --> 22:33.185
There's no port on the Narrow Sea
would dare to make

22:33.268 --> 22:35.145
an enemy of the Velaryon fleet.

22:37.314 --> 22:39.858
-And our enemies?
-We have no friends among the Lannisters.

22:40.692 --> 22:43.695
Tyland has served the Hand
too long to turn against him.

22:43.779 --> 22:45.947
And Otto Hightower
needs the Lannister fleet.

22:46.031 --> 22:47.532
Without the Lannisters,
we are not like to find

22:47.616 --> 22:49.868
-any allies west of the Golden Tooth.
-No.

22:53.121 --> 22:55.248
The Riverlands are essential,
Your Grace.

22:56.458 --> 23:00.003
Pray forgive my bluntness, Your Grace,
but talk of men is moot.

23:00.754 --> 23:04.382
Your cause owns a power
that has not been seen in this world

23:04.466 --> 23:06.968
since the days of Old Valyria.

23:07.052 --> 23:08.386
Dragons.

23:11.431 --> 23:12.849
The Greens have dragons as well.

23:12.933 --> 23:14.935
They have three adults, by my count.

23:15.018 --> 23:17.854
We have Syrax, Caraxes, and Meleys.

23:17.938 --> 23:20.857
Your sons have Vermax, Arrax, and Tyraxes.

23:20.941 --> 23:22.692
Baela has Moondancer.

23:22.776 --> 23:24.653
Daemon, none of our dragons
have been to war.

23:24.736 --> 23:26.696
There are also unclaimed dragons.

23:26.780 --> 23:28.824
Seasmoke still resides on Driftmark.

23:28.907 --> 23:31.910
Vermithor and Silverwing
dwell on the Dragonmont,

23:31.993 --> 23:33.078
still riderless.

23:34.162 --> 23:36.456
Then there are the three wild dragons,
all of whom nest here.

23:36.540 --> 23:37.874
And who is to ride them?

23:37.958 --> 23:41.294
Dragonstone has 13 to their 4.

23:41.378 --> 23:44.548
I also have a score of eggs
incubating in the Dragonmont.

23:44.631 --> 23:48.093
Now... we need a place to gather,

23:48.176 --> 23:51.763
a toehold large enough
to house a sizable host.

23:51.847 --> 23:53.181
Here, at Harrenhal.

23:53.265 --> 23:55.475
We cut off the west,
surround King's Landing with the dragons.

23:55.559 --> 23:57.310
And we could have every Green head
mounted on spikes

23:57.394 --> 23:59.312
before the fucking moon turns.

23:59.396 --> 24:00.981
Your Grace...

24:01.064 --> 24:02.858
a ship has been sighted offshore:

24:02.941 --> 24:05.485
a lone galleon, flying a banner
of a three-headed green dragon.

24:05.569 --> 24:07.654
Alert the watchtowers. Sight the skies.

24:45.442 --> 24:48.403
I come at the behest
of the Dowager Queen Alicent,

24:48.486 --> 24:50.655
mother of King Aegon, Second of His Name,

24:50.739 --> 24:53.491
Lord and Protector of the Seven Kingdoms.

24:54.367 --> 24:58.872
I've been directed to deliver her message
only to Princess Rhaenyra.

24:59.706 --> 25:01.625
Where is the Princess?

25:56.054 --> 25:58.056
Princess Rhaenyra.

25:58.974 --> 26:00.892
I'm Queen Rhaenyra now.

26:01.935 --> 26:04.104
And you all are traitors to the realm.

26:04.688 --> 26:08.608
King Aegon Targaryen,
Second of His Name...

26:10.193 --> 26:13.655
in his wisdom and desire for peace,

26:13.738 --> 26:15.156
is offering terms.

26:17.617 --> 26:19.327
Acknowledge Aegon as king

26:19.411 --> 26:22.247
and swear obeisance
before the Iron Throne.

26:22.330 --> 26:26.167
In exchange, His Grace will confirm
your possession of Dragonstone.

26:26.876 --> 26:30.505
It will pass to your trueborn son,
Jacaerys, upon your death.

26:30.588 --> 26:33.925
Lucerys will be confirmed
as the legitimate heir to Driftmark

26:34.009 --> 26:36.761
and all the lands and holdings
of House Velaryon.

26:36.845 --> 26:38.763
Your sons by Prince Daemon

26:38.847 --> 26:41.766
will also be given places
of high honor at court:

26:41.850 --> 26:44.311
Aegon the Younger as the King's squire,

26:44.394 --> 26:46.313
Viserys as his cupbearer.

26:46.396 --> 26:48.481
Finally, the King, in his good grace,

26:48.565 --> 26:52.986
will pardon any knight or lord
who conspired against his ascent.

26:53.737 --> 26:56.406
I would rather feed my sons to the dragons

26:56.489 --> 26:59.534
than have them carry shields and cups

26:59.617 --> 27:03.413
for your drunken, usurper cunt of a king.

27:03.913 --> 27:07.250
Aegon Targaryen sits the Iron Throne.

27:08.376 --> 27:10.170
He wears the Conqueror's crown,

27:10.253 --> 27:12.005
wields the Conqueror's sword,

27:12.088 --> 27:13.506
has the Conqueror's name.

27:13.590 --> 27:16.384
He was anointed by a septon of the Faith

27:16.468 --> 27:18.345
before the eyes of thousands.

27:18.428 --> 27:22.766
Every symbol of legitimacy belongs to him.

27:24.893 --> 27:28.188
And then there is Stark, Tully, Baratheon.

27:28.271 --> 27:32.317
Houses that have also received,
and are at present,

27:32.400 --> 27:35.570
considering generous terms
from their king.

27:37.238 --> 27:41.451
Stark, Tully, and Baratheon
all swore to me

27:41.534 --> 27:44.162
when King Viserys named me his heir.

27:44.579 --> 27:48.708
Stale oaths will not put you
on the Iron Throne, Princess.

27:49.417 --> 27:53.338
The succession changed the day
your father sired a son.

27:53.922 --> 27:57.759
I only regret that you and he
were the last to see the truth of it.

27:58.843 --> 28:01.137
You are no more Hand than Aegon is king.

28:01.221 --> 28:02.806
Fucking traitor.

28:14.609 --> 28:16.194
Grand Maester.

28:21.533 --> 28:22.659
What the fuck is this?

28:38.258 --> 28:42.720
Queen Alicent has not forgotten the love
you once had for each other.

28:43.388 --> 28:48.852
No blood need be spilled,
so the realm can carry on in peace.

28:52.397 --> 28:54.691
Queen Alicent eagerly awaits your answer.

28:54.774 --> 28:57.026
She can have her answer now,
stuffed in her father's mouth

28:57.110 --> 28:58.278
along with his withered cock.

28:58.361 --> 29:00.280
Let's end this mummer's farce.

29:01.865 --> 29:05.076
Ser Erryk, bring me Lord Hightower
so I may take the pleasure myself.

29:10.165 --> 29:11.124
No.

29:22.969 --> 29:25.513
King's Landing will have
my answer on the morrow.

29:47.619 --> 29:51.581
It's no easy thing for a man
to be a dragonslayer.

29:51.664 --> 29:54.584
But dragons can kill dragons. And have.

29:55.627 --> 29:58.963
The simple truth is this:
we have more dragons than Aegon.

29:59.047 --> 30:01.382
Viserys spoke often
of the Valyrian histories.

30:01.466 --> 30:03.009
I know them well.

30:03.801 --> 30:05.929
When dragons flew to war...

30:06.846 --> 30:08.223
everything burned.

30:10.433 --> 30:13.520
I do not wish to rule
over a kingdom of ash and bone.

30:13.603 --> 30:16.356
Are you considering the Hightowers' terms,
Your Grace?

30:16.940 --> 30:20.568
As Queen, what is my true duty
to the realm, Lord Bartimos?

30:21.152 --> 30:22.612
Ensuring peace and unity?

30:22.695 --> 30:25.657
Or that I sit the Iron Throne,
no matter the cost?

30:25.740 --> 30:28.284
-That's your father talking.
-My father's dead.

30:30.119 --> 30:32.247
And he chose me as his successor...

30:34.707 --> 30:37.252
to defend the realm,
not cast it headlong into war.

30:37.335 --> 30:38.795
Well, the enemy have declared war.

30:39.587 --> 30:41.172
What are you gonna do about it?

30:44.717 --> 30:45.843
Clear the room.

31:16.416 --> 31:18.001
Does the promise of war excite you?

31:18.084 --> 31:19.877
You cannot bend the knee
to the Hightowers.

31:19.961 --> 31:21.504
They stole your birthright.

31:21.588 --> 31:23.214
If you could take the Iron Throne

31:23.298 --> 31:25.383
without putting Otto Hightower's
head on a spike,

31:25.466 --> 31:26.926
-would you?
-Are you not angry?

31:27.010 --> 31:29.345
-I should declare war because I'm angry?
-No.

31:29.429 --> 31:31.472
Because it's your duty
as Queen to crush rebellion.

31:31.556 --> 31:35.435
You know my oath
reaches beyond our personal ambitions.

31:38.563 --> 31:40.481
A Song of Ice and Fire.

31:43.192 --> 31:44.319
What?

31:45.737 --> 31:47.405
The coming war against
the darkness in the North,

31:47.488 --> 31:49.532
The Conqueror's Dream.

31:49.616 --> 31:51.701
Viserys shared it with me
when he named me heir.

31:56.623 --> 32:00.960
My brother... was a slave to his
omens and portents.

32:01.878 --> 32:05.381
Anything to make his feckless reign
appear to have purpose.

32:09.135 --> 32:11.054
Dreams didn't make us kings.

32:12.180 --> 32:13.723
Dragons did.

32:31.658 --> 32:33.159
He never told you...

32:37.121 --> 32:38.247
did he?

33:15.618 --> 33:19.956
I've had men whipped for falling asleep
on their watch.

33:26.003 --> 33:27.547
You are no man.

33:32.343 --> 33:34.262
You abandoned me...

33:35.930 --> 33:37.682
when I most needed you.

33:38.850 --> 33:41.018
Both our children stolen from us.

33:42.520 --> 33:43.730
I needed you.

33:44.397 --> 33:45.815
Baela and Rhaena needed you,

33:45.898 --> 33:48.985
and you abandoned us
for more adventure at sea.

33:49.068 --> 33:51.028
As has always been your way.

33:52.822 --> 33:55.366
I had no other place to turn.

33:56.701 --> 34:00.037
-I lost everything.
-We lost, Corlys.

34:01.956 --> 34:02.874
We.

34:15.928 --> 34:18.306
I understand we have a new king.

34:18.389 --> 34:21.726
The Stranger casts a long shadow
over this family.

34:28.191 --> 34:29.942
Your brother is also dead.

34:35.031 --> 34:37.992
In his haste to bury you
and claim your seat,

34:38.076 --> 34:39.577
he stood before the King

34:39.660 --> 34:42.455
and denounced
Laenor's sons as illegitimate.

34:47.627 --> 34:50.171
Daemon took his head for it.

34:54.801 --> 34:59.347
Heedless ambition has always been
a Velaryon weakness.

35:03.643 --> 35:05.561
You were right, Rhaenys.

35:07.396 --> 35:10.942
I reached too far. And for nothing.

35:13.277 --> 35:18.199
Our pursuit of the Iron Throne...
is at an end.

35:22.578 --> 35:25.498
We shall declare for no one.

35:26.999 --> 35:29.168
We will retire to High Tide

35:29.252 --> 35:30.795
to be content...

35:31.420 --> 35:33.798
with our grandchildren and--

35:33.881 --> 35:37.009
Jace, Luke, and Joff
are claimants to the throne.

35:38.761 --> 35:41.681
Those boys'll not be safe
so long as Aegon is king.

35:44.141 --> 35:48.271
Rhaenyra was complicit in our son's death.

35:49.772 --> 35:52.400
That girl destroys everything she touches.

35:52.483 --> 35:54.443
That "girl"...

35:54.527 --> 35:56.821
is holding the realm together at present.

35:57.780 --> 35:59.574
Every man standing
'round the Painted Table

35:59.657 --> 36:01.784
urges her to plunge the realm into war.

36:04.203 --> 36:07.415
Rhaenyra's the only one
who's demonstrated restraint.

36:07.498 --> 36:10.835
The purpose of war is to fill graveyards,
my dear Lord Staunton.

36:10.918 --> 36:14.005
The trick is to put more of their men
in the ground than your own.

36:14.088 --> 36:15.631
Easy words for a lord who commands

36:15.715 --> 36:17.341
-from the safety of his castle.
-Doesn't make it any less true.

36:17.425 --> 36:19.176
The Lord of the Tides!

36:19.719 --> 36:21.637
Lord Corlys Velaryon...

36:22.597 --> 36:26.142
and his wife,
the Princess Rhaenys Targaryen.

36:37.528 --> 36:39.113
My lords.

36:39.196 --> 36:40.740
Lord Corlys.

36:41.657 --> 36:44.285
It brings much relief to see you hale
and healthy again.

36:46.787 --> 36:49.540
I'm very sorry about your father,
Princess.

36:50.166 --> 36:51.709
He was a good man.

37:03.429 --> 37:04.555
Where is Daemon?

37:05.765 --> 37:08.684
There were other concerns which
demanded the Prince's attention.

37:20.112 --> 37:21.447
Your declared allies?

37:23.074 --> 37:26.702
-Yes.
-Too few to win a war for the throne.

37:28.329 --> 37:30.998
Well, we would also
hope to have the support

37:31.082 --> 37:34.043
-of Houses Arryn, Baratheon, and Stark.
-Hope...

37:34.961 --> 37:36.504
is the fool's ally.

37:38.130 --> 37:41.342
Both Arryn and Baratheon
share blood with my house.

37:41.425 --> 37:43.469
But all of them swore oaths to me.

37:43.552 --> 37:45.388
As did House Hightower...

37:45.471 --> 37:46.639
if I remember.

37:46.722 --> 37:49.684
As did you, Lord Corlys.

38:03.531 --> 38:04.865
Your father's realm...

38:06.075 --> 38:08.911
was one of justice and honor.

38:10.037 --> 38:14.417
Our houses are bound by common blood
and common cause.

38:16.043 --> 38:18.963
This Hightower treason cannot stand.

38:24.677 --> 38:28.222
You have the full support
of our fleet and house.

38:29.849 --> 38:31.100
Your Grace.

38:39.900 --> 38:41.652
You honor me, Lord Corlys.

38:47.867 --> 38:49.827
Princess Rhaenys.

38:53.914 --> 38:57.585
But, as I said to my bannermen,

38:57.668 --> 39:01.547
I made a promise to my father
to hold the realm strong and united.

39:03.215 --> 39:06.260
If war's first stroke is to fall,
it will not be by my hand.

39:07.762 --> 39:09.138
You do not mean to act?

39:09.221 --> 39:12.725
Taking caution
does not mean standing fast.

39:12.808 --> 39:17.730
I wish to know who my allies are
before I send them to war.

39:25.529 --> 39:27.448
The consequence of my...

39:28.074 --> 39:30.993
near-demise in the Stepstones...

39:32.328 --> 39:34.080
is that we now control them.

39:34.830 --> 39:37.416
I took care to fully garrison
the territory this time.

39:37.500 --> 39:41.879
A total blockade of the shipping lanes
will be in place in days, if not already.

39:42.546 --> 39:44.965
The Triarchy have been routed.

39:45.049 --> 39:46.967
The Narrow Sea is ours.

39:49.804 --> 39:52.598
If we further seal the Gullet,

39:52.681 --> 39:55.684
we can cut off
all seaborne travel and trade

39:55.768 --> 39:57.061
to King's Landing.

39:58.020 --> 40:00.606
I shall take Meleys
and patrol the Gullet myself.

40:05.736 --> 40:08.531
When we drain the Narrow Sea,

40:08.614 --> 40:10.616
we can surround King's Landing,

40:10.699 --> 40:12.952
lay siege to the Red Keep,

40:13.035 --> 40:15.496
and force the Greens' surrender.

40:15.579 --> 40:19.291
If we are to have enough swords
to surround King's Landing,

40:19.375 --> 40:23.003
we must first secure the support
of Winterfell, the Eyrie, and Storm's End.

40:23.087 --> 40:25.047
I'll prepare the ravens, Your Grace.

40:25.965 --> 40:28.509
We should bear those messages.

40:29.510 --> 40:32.471
Dragons can fly faster than ravens

40:32.555 --> 40:34.098
and they're more convincing.

40:37.726 --> 40:38.853
Send us.

40:40.855 --> 40:42.773
The Prince is right, Your Grace.

40:51.949 --> 40:52.950
Very well.

40:53.951 --> 40:56.495
Prince Jacaerys will fly north.

40:57.163 --> 41:00.332
First to the Eyrie to see
my mother's cousin, the Lady Jeyne Arryn,

41:00.416 --> 41:03.252
and then to Winterfell
to treat with Lord Cregan Stark

41:03.335 --> 41:05.254
for the support of the North.

41:06.463 --> 41:09.258
Prince Lucerys will fly
south to Storm's End

41:09.341 --> 41:12.136
and treat with Lord Borros Baratheon.

41:12.219 --> 41:16.265
We must remind these lords
of the oaths they swore.

41:17.975 --> 41:20.895
And... the cost of breaking them.

41:44.919 --> 41:50.090
It's been said that as Targaryens,
we are closer to gods than to men.

41:52.176 --> 41:55.095
And the Iron Throne
puts us a touch closer, perhaps.

41:56.889 --> 42:00.809
But, if we are to serve
the Seven Kingdoms...

42:01.852 --> 42:03.771
we must answer to their gods.

42:04.855 --> 42:09.318
If you take this errand,
you go as messengers... not as warriors.

42:10.027 --> 42:12.571
You must take no part in any fighting.

42:13.822 --> 42:17.993
Swear it to me now
under the eyes of the Seven.

42:22.873 --> 42:23.999
I swear it.

42:28.921 --> 42:30.047
I swear it.

42:31.340 --> 42:32.258
Thank you.

42:36.011 --> 42:37.930
Cregan Stark is...

42:38.889 --> 42:40.975
close to your age than is mine.

42:41.058 --> 42:45.479
I would hope, that as men,
you can find some common interest.

42:45.938 --> 42:47.273
Yes, Your Grace.

42:55.698 --> 42:57.825
Storm's End is a short flight from here.

42:59.535 --> 43:03.205
You have Baratheon blood
from your grandmother, Rhaenys.

43:03.289 --> 43:04.623
And...

43:04.707 --> 43:07.418
Lord Borros is an eternally proud man.

43:08.085 --> 43:12.089
He will be honored
to host a prince of the realm...

43:12.172 --> 43:13.507
and his dragon.

43:22.516 --> 43:25.436
I expect you will receive
a very warm welcome.

43:27.104 --> 43:28.856
Yes, Mother. Your Grace.

43:38.365 --> 43:40.034
Go to it then.

47:21.296 --> 47:23.215
I am Prince Lucerys Velaryon.

47:24.049 --> 47:26.051
I bring a message to Lord Borros
from the Queen.

47:43.193 --> 47:45.320
Prince Lucerys Velaryon.

47:51.702 --> 47:55.247
Son of Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen.

47:59.293 --> 48:00.627
Lord Borros...

48:02.504 --> 48:05.048
I brought you a message from my mother...

48:05.632 --> 48:06.758
the Queen.

48:07.884 --> 48:11.263
Yet earlier this day,
I received an envoy from the King.

48:12.472 --> 48:14.141
Which is it?

48:14.224 --> 48:16.935
King or Queen?

48:17.019 --> 48:19.730
The House of the Dragon
does not seem to know who rules it.

48:22.524 --> 48:25.068
What's your mother's message?

48:41.251 --> 48:42.878
Where's the bloody maester?

49:17.788 --> 49:20.957
"Remind" me of my father's oath.

49:22.876 --> 49:24.836
King Aegon at least came with an offer:

49:24.920 --> 49:27.839
my swords and banners for a marriage pact.

49:29.007 --> 49:31.134
If I do as your mother bids...

49:32.302 --> 49:34.846
which one of my daughters will you wed...

49:36.348 --> 49:37.724
boy?

49:38.517 --> 49:41.853
My lord... I am not free to marry.

49:43.021 --> 49:44.439
I'm already betrothed.

49:46.692 --> 49:49.111
So you come with empty hands.

49:51.196 --> 49:52.739
Go home, pup.

49:53.448 --> 49:55.617
And tell your mother
that the Lord of Storm's End

49:55.701 --> 50:00.205
is not some dog that she can whistle up
at need to set against her foes.

50:02.457 --> 50:06.294
I shall take your answer
to the Queen, my lord.

50:12.551 --> 50:14.094
Wait...

50:15.929 --> 50:17.472
my Lord Strong.

50:22.394 --> 50:26.732
Did you really think
that you could just fly about the realm

50:26.815 --> 50:29.359
trying to steal my brother's throne
at no cost?

50:31.194 --> 50:32.738
I will not fight you.

50:33.947 --> 50:36.825
I came as a messenger, not a warrior.

50:36.908 --> 50:38.452
A fight would be little challenge.

50:41.621 --> 50:42.748
No.

50:43.707 --> 50:45.625
I want you to put out your eye.

50:48.545 --> 50:49.880
As payment for mine.

50:52.382 --> 50:53.717
One will serve.

50:57.721 --> 50:59.097
I would not blind you.

51:01.349 --> 51:04.394
Plan to make a gift of it to my mother.

51:08.774 --> 51:09.691
No.

51:11.026 --> 51:12.986
Then you are craven as well as a traitor.

51:13.069 --> 51:15.030
-Not here.
-Give me your eye

51:15.697 --> 51:17.908
or I will take it, bastard!

51:17.991 --> 51:19.910
Not in my hall!

51:20.911 --> 51:22.704
The boy came as an envoy.

51:22.788 --> 51:24.790
I'll not have bloodshed beneath my roof.

51:25.415 --> 51:27.584
Take Prince Lucerys back to his dragon.

51:27.667 --> 51:29.419
Now.

55:08.471 --> 55:12.809
No, no, no, no, no! No, Vhagar! No!

55:13.685 --> 55:15.311
Serve me, Vhagar! No!

55:38.752 --> 55:41.671
Vhagar! No! No.
