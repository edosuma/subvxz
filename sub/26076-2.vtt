00:14.014 --> 00:16.641
[indistinct chatter]

00:36.995 --> 00:41.124
[sighs] You don't have something
a little less flashy?

00:41.207 --> 00:43.001
Not in the size you need, bro.

01:02.270 --> 01:04.189
[Golden Tiger member grunting]

01:04.272 --> 01:05.315
[groaning]

01:07.400 --> 01:09.194
[Hatchet members grunting]

01:09.277 --> 01:10.445
[Golden Tiger member groaning]

01:16.493 --> 01:18.078
[gasping]

01:18.870 --> 01:20.497
[indistinct chatter]

01:30.632 --> 01:32.175
[continues gasping]

01:37.430 --> 01:39.140
It's gonna be okay. You'll be okay.

01:43.019 --> 01:44.062
Anyone see what happened?

01:45.188 --> 01:46.481
Call 911!

01:49.526 --> 01:51.694
[siren wailing]

02:04.874 --> 02:06.876
[theme music playing] [indistinct chatter]

03:53.274 --> 03:55.109
Oh, hi! Hi.

03:58.404 --> 04:00.198
Twice in two days. Fancy that.

04:00.281 --> 04:02.283
Yeah, I was just walking by
and I saw you.

04:02.367 --> 04:05.912
Sorry it took a second to place you.
I get really focused when I draw.

04:05.995 --> 04:06.996
[Danny] Wow. What is this?

04:07.080 --> 04:10.583
[Mary] Oh, it's a work in progress.
I could show you a finished one.

04:12.543 --> 04:14.295
-Here we go.
-[Danny] Wow.

04:15.546 --> 04:18.091
-You're really good.
-Thank you.

04:18.967 --> 04:21.261
Tell that to the agencies
where I dropped my résumé.

04:21.344 --> 04:22.595
If I don't land a gig soon,

04:22.679 --> 04:25.306
I'm gonna be couch-surfing
into my golden years.

04:25.390 --> 04:28.351
Agencies, huh?
So, like, uh, commercial art?

04:28.935 --> 04:31.312
I would draw for anyone
who'd float a paycheck.

04:31.396 --> 04:33.815
My only offer so far
has been from an Uber driver.

04:33.898 --> 04:36.234
-[Danny] Well, that's a start.
-[chuckles] I thought so, too,

04:36.317 --> 04:40.697
until he invited me up to his place
'cause his cat craves female attention.

04:40.780 --> 04:42.907
-Yikes.
-This city's intoxicating,

04:42.991 --> 04:44.117
every corner of it,

04:44.200 --> 04:47.495
but... it's hard to know
where in the puzzle I fit in.

04:47.578 --> 04:51.374
Hmm. New York can be
a lonely place sometimes.

04:52.959 --> 04:55.753
Some days, I get hit
by this self-doubt tidal wave.

04:55.837 --> 04:57.213
That internal monologue, like,

04:57.297 --> 04:59.757
"Did you think you could just show up
with a sketchbook

04:59.841 --> 05:01.634
and people would start
throwing money at you?"

05:01.718 --> 05:04.512
Well, you're not the first
or the last person to think that.

05:05.096 --> 05:08.474
Hopes and dreams are seeded
into the sidewalk here, and...

05:09.183 --> 05:10.560
sometimes they blossom.

05:11.728 --> 05:14.897
-You're a ray of light, aren't you?
-[scoffs] Hardly.

05:14.981 --> 05:17.108
Just someone who's sat
where you're sitting.

05:17.191 --> 05:19.027
Literally. I love this view.

05:19.110 --> 05:23.114
Everyone on their way to something.
Lives crisscrossing...

05:23.197 --> 05:25.283
-And sometimes they collide.
-[chuckles]

05:25.366 --> 05:26.451
Hey, you know the area.

05:26.534 --> 05:29.078
I'm looking for a park
where people practice tai chi,

05:29.162 --> 05:31.122
'cause I like to try
and capture that motion.

05:31.205 --> 05:32.915
Yeah, you want Columbus Park.

05:32.999 --> 05:36.544
But you probably wanna avoid
wandering around Chinatown today.

05:37.253 --> 05:38.254
Okay.

05:38.338 --> 05:41.007
-You draw flowers?
-Yeah, I've been known to dabble.

05:41.090 --> 05:44.260
I mean... [chuckles]
file under "beautiful but fleeting."

05:44.344 --> 05:48.348
Well, there's a flower market on 28th.
My place is near the train you need.

05:48.431 --> 05:52.352
-Oh, great. So we could walk together?
-Yeah, sure.

05:52.435 --> 05:53.436
[Mary] All right.

05:55.730 --> 05:57.440
Earth to Danny.

05:57.523 --> 06:00.651
Sorry. There's been some bad stuff
in the neighborhood today.

06:00.735 --> 06:02.153
My boss called off work.

06:02.236 --> 06:05.073
Oh. Bummer. But on the bright side,

06:05.156 --> 06:08.534
I get a tour of Chinatown
from a born and bred New Yorker.

06:08.618 --> 06:11.746
It's a very brief tour.
My place is around the corner.

06:11.829 --> 06:13.623
You can take the A train
a couple blocks up.

06:13.706 --> 06:16.918
Thank you. Well, I hope our paths
crisscross again sometime.

06:17.001 --> 06:19.212
I'm staying up in Murray Hill, so...

06:23.216 --> 06:24.133
Mary?

06:24.217 --> 06:27.136
I'm sorry. I just got all caught up
in that church spire.

06:27.220 --> 06:30.681
The way the light is hitting it
right now is just...

06:31.933 --> 06:33.101
It's lovely.

06:34.602 --> 06:38.356
I hope I didn't give you the wrong idea,
but I live with my girlfriend.

06:38.439 --> 06:40.650
Oh, God. I'm sorry.
I did not mean to offend.

06:40.733 --> 06:43.069
[breathing deeply]
Oh, I should go. I'm sorry.

06:44.153 --> 06:45.279
Are you okay?

06:46.948 --> 06:49.242
[exhales] That was just...

06:50.576 --> 06:52.537
[inhales sharply] Wow.

06:52.620 --> 06:56.707
-Hey, hey, hey. Whoa. Easy. Easy.
-I'm fine.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.627
It's just, sometimes, I get a little...

06:59.710 --> 07:01.712
I get a little overwhelmed, and...

07:01.796 --> 07:04.966
Why... Why don't you come up to my place?
Come on.

07:06.717 --> 07:08.302
Get you a glass of water.

07:09.262 --> 07:10.388
[door opens]

07:10.471 --> 07:12.515
-[Danny] Hey.
-Hey.

07:13.182 --> 07:15.476
Mary, this is my girlfriend, Colleen.

07:16.811 --> 07:17.728
Uh, hi.

07:18.563 --> 07:20.064
Colleen, this is Mary.

07:20.148 --> 07:22.150
-Nice to meet you.
-Yeah.

07:22.233 --> 07:24.610
Mary had a bit of a spell outside.

07:24.694 --> 07:26.487
-Dehydrated, I think.
-[Colleen] Ah.

07:26.571 --> 07:30.199
Might be a caffeine overload.
I did drink a lot of matcha tea.

07:30.283 --> 07:32.618
-I'm sorry to intrude.
-No, don't even worry.

07:32.702 --> 07:37.540
I love your place.
It's so eclectic and full of life.

07:37.623 --> 07:41.752
I saw a sign outside, "Chikara Dojo."
So, was this a karate school?

07:42.670 --> 07:45.381
It was. Now it's just home.

07:45.465 --> 07:46.507
Right.

07:46.591 --> 07:48.134
-Oh.
-There you go.

07:48.217 --> 07:50.303
[Mary] Mmm-hmm. [gulping]

07:54.140 --> 07:56.392
Mmm-hmm. Thank you. I feel so much better.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.227
How do you two know each other?

07:58.311 --> 08:01.481
Oh, we... we just ran into each other
the other day.

08:01.564 --> 08:02.857
Mary's new in town, so...

08:02.940 --> 08:04.484
-Uh-huh.
-...I gave her directions.

08:04.567 --> 08:06.527
Yeah, I was all turned around.

08:06.611 --> 08:09.780
That's twice now
he's gone out of his way to be sweet.

08:09.864 --> 08:12.158
Yeah, he's good like that.

08:12.241 --> 08:15.912
No, you're both so kind.

08:17.246 --> 08:19.540
Let me thank you with a, you know...

08:19.624 --> 08:23.711
-For your... wall or your trashcan.
-Oh.

08:23.794 --> 08:24.879
[Mary] Whatever you prefer.

08:24.962 --> 08:28.841
Thank you. It's really not necessary.
Wow. You are really talented.

08:28.925 --> 08:30.051
Thank you.

08:31.427 --> 08:33.429
[heart beat intensifies]

08:35.973 --> 08:37.391
Can I use your bathroom?

08:38.267 --> 08:40.520
Of course. Yeah, it's just, uh...
it's just past the...

08:52.698 --> 08:55.201
I thought you were supposed to be at work.

08:55.284 --> 08:56.786
I was.

08:56.869 --> 08:59.539
And then a Golden Tiger died
right in front of me.

09:00.331 --> 09:01.958
Attacked by the Hatchets.

09:02.667 --> 09:04.043
In broad daylight?

09:04.669 --> 09:05.753
Open war.

09:06.921 --> 09:08.214
-[exhales]
-I called Albert.

09:08.297 --> 09:09.924
He told me not to come in.

09:10.007 --> 09:13.010
It's a bad day to be moving boxes
around Golden Tiger territory.

09:13.636 --> 09:17.348
So when I saw Mary, new in town,
wandering around Chinatown...

09:17.431 --> 09:19.225
Mmm. You were "sweet."

09:20.476 --> 09:22.228
What's that supposed to mean?

09:22.311 --> 09:25.273
[whispering] Come on,
she's obviously crushing on you.

09:26.065 --> 09:28.526
Yeah, well, she's only human.

09:28.609 --> 09:30.319
[both laugh]

09:30.403 --> 09:32.405
[heart beat thumping] [breathing heavily]

09:50.548 --> 09:52.550
[heart beat settles]

10:33.090 --> 10:36.761
-I gotta go. I'm running late.
-I thought you said you were sketching?

10:36.844 --> 10:39.930
I forgot about an appointment.
Thank you both for everything.

10:40.014 --> 10:42.141
-[Colleen] Yeah, uh, okay.
-[door slams]

10:43.851 --> 10:45.728
Well, she's an odd one.

10:45.811 --> 10:48.773
Yeah. But I think she means well.

10:49.649 --> 10:53.569
-You at Bayard today?
-Yeah, I'm meeting Sam at noon.

10:54.111 --> 10:57.448
He's helping me track down
this furniture store owner, Frank Choi.

10:58.449 --> 11:01.327
[Danny sighs] The box
that belonged to your mother.

11:01.869 --> 11:05.206
I'm sorry. I've been so caught up
with all this Triad stuff--

11:05.289 --> 11:07.416
Do not even worry about it.

11:08.084 --> 11:09.627
You're dealing with a lot.

11:09.710 --> 11:12.963
Yeah. But that's no excuse.
I know how much this means to you.

11:14.173 --> 11:15.758
So, you got a lead?

11:15.841 --> 11:17.093
Maybe.

11:17.176 --> 11:20.096
If Choi owed someone
like his cousin thought,

11:20.179 --> 11:23.140
he may have come to Bayard
looking for help. So...

11:23.224 --> 11:25.810
there could be a file or something on him.

11:25.893 --> 11:28.437
Well, let me know if there's anything
I can do to help.

11:29.480 --> 11:31.357
I will, thank you.

11:31.440 --> 11:33.901
What are you gonna do with your day off?

11:33.984 --> 11:37.071
Try and find a way
to get ahead of all this Triad violence.

11:38.781 --> 11:40.449
You think what you saw today
on the street

11:40.533 --> 11:42.660
was Hatchet payback
for the robbery the other night?

11:42.743 --> 11:43.869
My head went there.

11:47.248 --> 11:48.290
[Danny typing]

11:49.291 --> 11:53.087
You know the leader of the Hatchets.
Why not ask him the details?

11:54.171 --> 11:56.048
-Mr. Yang?
-Yeah.

11:57.633 --> 12:00.177
Well, we went after the Hand together,

12:00.261 --> 12:04.348
but now they're gone,
it's not like we have much common ground.

12:04.432 --> 12:05.641
Then find some.

12:06.642 --> 12:08.978
Speaking of common ground...

12:10.271 --> 12:12.690
you never said
what Davos wanted the other night.

12:12.773 --> 12:15.401
[sighs and scoffs]

12:15.484 --> 12:17.528
Some kind of apology, I think.

12:18.112 --> 12:19.029
For what?

12:20.364 --> 12:22.283
Winning the Iron Fist.

12:22.366 --> 12:24.869
Coming back to New York.

12:24.952 --> 12:26.412
Losing K'un-Lun.

12:27.496 --> 12:30.541
You make it sound
like you did those things to him.

12:30.624 --> 12:32.501
Yeah. [sighs deeply]

12:33.377 --> 12:37.923
That fight we had,
to see who would face Shou-Lao? [scoffs]

12:38.758 --> 12:40.676
It feels like it never ended.

12:45.055 --> 12:46.599
Except you won.

12:54.440 --> 12:55.441
I did.

13:06.118 --> 13:08.120
[drum beating]

13:46.200 --> 13:49.995
Only two warriors remain unbeaten.

13:50.704 --> 13:53.415
Only one shall be victorious.

13:53.999 --> 13:57.878
Only one shall win the right
to face the dragon known as Shou-Lao.

14:28.325 --> 14:29.451
Davos...

14:30.703 --> 14:32.621
Daniel Rand-K'ai...

14:33.289 --> 14:36.667
neither of you may leave this place
or this combat

14:36.750 --> 14:41.005
until one of you yields... or dies.

14:43.173 --> 14:44.258
[breathes deeply]

14:45.259 --> 14:46.635
Begin!

14:47.136 --> 14:49.138
[both grunting]

15:07.948 --> 15:09.116
[chuckles]

15:10.117 --> 15:11.243
[Sam] What's up, Wing?

15:11.869 --> 15:15.623
Uh, okay, no one calls me that.

15:15.706 --> 15:17.958
Uh, I do. It sounds cool.

15:18.042 --> 15:23.297
Like Kanye, Madonna, Keesha.

15:23.380 --> 15:24.882
You mean Ke$ha?

15:25.966 --> 15:27.259
-Her too.
-[both laugh]

15:27.343 --> 15:29.094
Okay, I'll take it.

15:29.178 --> 15:32.473
So, I have some bad news
about the Frank Choi thing.

15:32.556 --> 15:33.682
Julie, the bookkeeper,

15:33.766 --> 15:38.270
remembers him coming for help with a loan
when he first signed his commercial lease.

15:38.354 --> 15:41.982
-Uh-huh.
-But there's no file, and you know Julie.

15:42.566 --> 15:46.320
She keeps track of pencil shavings. Hmm.

15:46.987 --> 15:50.157
Well, maybe there was a file
and someone tossed it?

15:50.240 --> 15:52.159
Why would anyone do that?

15:52.242 --> 15:53.786
So Choi couldn't be found.

15:54.411 --> 15:56.747
Wherever he left,
he went in a hurry, and...

15:56.830 --> 15:59.124
his shop is still full of furniture.

16:00.292 --> 16:03.587
It could be. Or, you know,
maybe it just got lost in the shuffle.

16:03.671 --> 16:05.881
And this place? All shuffle,

16:05.965 --> 16:07.091
-all the time.
-All the time.

16:07.174 --> 16:08.425
Right.

16:08.509 --> 16:12.930
Well, I appreciate you digging for me.
What are we doing? [chuckles]

16:13.013 --> 16:15.975
It's a charity casino thing.

16:16.058 --> 16:18.143
Oh. Gambling. Sounds fun.

16:18.227 --> 16:21.021
[chuckles] Honestly,
it makes me a little uncomfortable.

16:21.105 --> 16:22.064
Why?

16:22.147 --> 16:23.774
[smacks lips] Mrs. Yang's throwing it.

16:23.857 --> 16:26.318
I know we count on her support
to keep the lights on

16:26.402 --> 16:27.486
so we look the other way,

16:27.569 --> 16:31.573
but everyone knows
her husband has connections.

16:33.867 --> 16:36.453
Mrs. Yang, as in Sherry Yang on the board?

16:37.538 --> 16:38.914
She's Hai-Qing Yang's wife?

16:38.998 --> 16:42.251
She does a ton for the community.
So, who am I to judge, right?

16:42.334 --> 16:45.462
[chuckles] "Forget it, Jake.
It's Chinatown."

16:47.464 --> 16:51.093
Oh, come on! <i>Chinatown?</i>
Jack Nicholson, no?

16:52.386 --> 16:55.180
Danny has a stack of movies
he never watched growing up,

16:55.264 --> 16:58.517
-so we're making our way through the '70s.
-It's cool.

16:58.600 --> 16:59.977
Uh-huh. [chuckles]

17:00.728 --> 17:04.523
I guess I should go back to Choi's.
Maybe there's some detail I overlooked.

17:05.107 --> 17:07.651
Okay, cool. Good luck.

17:07.735 --> 17:10.112
Thank you. Have fun with this.

17:10.195 --> 17:11.405
Thanks.

17:11.488 --> 17:13.198
Don't lose all your money.

17:22.750 --> 17:24.084
[man 1] Hey! Leave me alone.

17:25.335 --> 17:26.920
[man 2] Shut up. Shut up!

17:27.337 --> 17:28.422
[woman] Give me your wallet.

17:28.505 --> 17:30.758
-[man 1] I don't have any money.
-[woman] Hey! Stop!

17:30.841 --> 17:32.509
-[man 1] Get off!
-[woman] Shut up!

17:32.593 --> 17:33.886
[Colleen] Hey!

17:33.969 --> 17:36.055
-[man 1] I said get off me.
-[Colleen] Hey! Stop!

17:39.016 --> 17:41.143
[breathes deeply] Oh.

17:41.727 --> 17:44.063
Okay, what's this about?

17:44.146 --> 17:47.566
Payback.
For the restaurant the other night.

17:47.649 --> 17:50.444
We were just trying to get paid.
And you disrespected us.

17:50.527 --> 17:53.280
I was trying to get you to leave
before the Tigers showed up.

17:53.363 --> 17:55.157
You mess with Ryhno, he hits back.

17:55.866 --> 17:57.076
Who's Ryhno?

17:58.077 --> 18:00.162
-Someone put you up to this?
-Don't.

18:01.205 --> 18:02.915
[both grunt]

18:02.998 --> 18:04.625
[sirens wailing]

18:08.295 --> 18:09.338
[panting] Shit.

18:20.140 --> 18:21.934
[yells in frustration]

18:39.493 --> 18:41.662
[electronic music playing]

19:00.097 --> 19:01.181
[Ryhno] You find her?

19:02.683 --> 19:03.934
Uh, yeah, we did.

19:04.601 --> 19:07.229
You didn't do what I told you to do,
did you?

19:08.438 --> 19:10.232
Nah, it got messed up.

19:10.816 --> 19:12.109
[man grunts]

19:13.068 --> 19:15.279
If you have a problem with me,
I'm right here.

19:18.115 --> 19:19.575
I just wanna talk.

19:20.367 --> 19:23.412
We got beef, right? So let's settle it.

19:23.495 --> 19:24.663
Works for me.

19:25.831 --> 19:28.709
All I was trying to do the other night
was stop--

19:32.337 --> 19:35.424
All I was trying to do
was stop a fight from happening.

19:35.507 --> 19:37.926
Way I remember it, you came at us.
You and your friend.

19:38.010 --> 19:40.220
'Cause you were trying
to shake people down.

19:40.304 --> 19:42.890
Muscling in on Tigers' turf
is asking for trouble.

19:43.849 --> 19:44.850
[sighs]

19:45.559 --> 19:46.894
Living in it is worse.

19:49.646 --> 19:51.481
I sent my boy out to pop you,

19:51.565 --> 19:54.026
and now you're trying
to look out for us or some shit?

19:55.819 --> 20:00.073
Yeah. I'm trying to do what's right.
The Tigers, the restaurant--

20:00.157 --> 20:02.159
The Tigers say this is their turf.

20:05.370 --> 20:08.081
But we grew up here. It's all we know.

20:09.750 --> 20:13.212
[Colleen] It's cold in here.
It must get colder at night.

20:14.379 --> 20:17.341
Any of you get sick, get hungry,
you come by Bayard.

20:17.424 --> 20:19.384
We'll give you a meal,
clothes, whatever you need.

20:19.468 --> 20:21.553
No charity. We don't owe.

20:22.512 --> 20:26.099
Not our parents. Not the Tigers.
Not the Hatchets. Not you.

20:26.683 --> 20:31.063
If you have to stay here, lay low.
Quit it with the pasting and the tagging.

20:31.146 --> 20:34.900
Don't listen to her, Ryhno, man.
She don't belong here.

20:36.610 --> 20:40.030
Get out of my kitchen, lady.
Before you get burned.

20:42.074 --> 20:46.203
Are we good? Because I can't have
your boy there coming after me.

20:51.917 --> 20:53.835
We good... for now.

20:55.963 --> 20:56.880
Bayard.

20:56.964 --> 20:59.925
The people there will help you,
no questions asked.

21:08.642 --> 21:12.020
It wasn't right.
Me about to pop off at you.

21:12.813 --> 21:16.441
I'm new to this scene.
If I wanna stay, I have to pull my weight.

21:22.030 --> 21:23.407
You're a smart kid.

21:24.741 --> 21:26.201
Smarter than you let on.

21:26.285 --> 21:28.287
[scoffs] Smart or dumb, I gotta eat.

21:28.370 --> 21:31.164
[scoffs] Got a lot of free food in prison.

21:31.957 --> 21:34.334
Unless the Tigers find you
squatting here first.

21:34.418 --> 21:37.337
The Tigers aren't gonna be
a problem anymore.

21:37.421 --> 21:41.216
We're parked in their turf because
the Hatchets are gonna crush them.

21:41.300 --> 21:44.511
Then we're gonna get our own turf.
Be for real players.

21:45.429 --> 21:47.639
The Hatchets are gonna try
and take out the Tigers?

21:47.723 --> 21:49.057
That's the word.

21:49.975 --> 21:51.184
The big dogs.

21:52.769 --> 21:54.187
And you know this how?

21:54.271 --> 21:56.606
[scoffs] 'Cause there ain't nothing
we don't know.

21:57.482 --> 22:00.986
"Anything." [winces]
Don't you go to school?

22:01.069 --> 22:03.530
Nah. I just stop in for lunch.

22:06.033 --> 22:09.578
Your boy, Ryhno?
There's a lot he doesn't know.

22:09.661 --> 22:12.039
Like, violence begets violence.

22:12.122 --> 22:13.832
"Begets" means "makes,"
which you would know

22:13.915 --> 22:16.043
if you went to school
for more than the shitty pizza.

22:18.170 --> 22:19.504
Colleen, by the way.

22:20.589 --> 22:23.216
BB. Like them little bullets.

22:30.390 --> 22:32.392
[indistinct chatter]

22:56.041 --> 22:57.250
Danny Rand.

22:57.959 --> 22:59.669
Could we talk for a moment?

23:00.295 --> 23:01.713
Alone?

23:08.970 --> 23:10.305
What can I do for you?

23:10.972 --> 23:15.519
You're on a path to war with the Tigers.
I'd like to help find a way to stop it.

23:16.186 --> 23:18.271
That could prove difficult.

23:19.022 --> 23:20.273
The docks...

23:21.191 --> 23:24.069
We have them. They want them.

23:24.653 --> 23:28.365
Control of the docks isn't worth a war
that will upend a whole neighborhood.

23:28.448 --> 23:30.826
Meet with the leaders, with the Tigers.

23:31.410 --> 23:36.415
If you can share access and profits,
everybody wins.

23:37.457 --> 23:39.501
Chinatown thrives.

23:41.795 --> 23:44.548
I might have considered
such a compromise...

23:45.465 --> 23:48.427
until the Tigers
tried to rob an armored car

23:48.510 --> 23:50.887
moving our funds a few nights ago.

23:51.471 --> 23:54.724
And that's why you had one of their men
killed this morning.

23:57.185 --> 24:01.148
My nephew was the driver
of that armored car.

24:02.691 --> 24:07.070
I'm sorry for your loss,
but that doesn't change the situation.

24:07.154 --> 24:11.283
I have no choice in this matter.
Blood for blood.

24:12.993 --> 24:16.413
That's not justice. That's escalation.

24:16.496 --> 24:18.081
It's my right.

24:19.249 --> 24:20.459
Don't walk away from this.

24:30.635 --> 24:31.887
[door opens]

24:35.432 --> 24:37.267
If you won't put this war to rest...

24:38.560 --> 24:39.853
then I'll find a way.

24:55.410 --> 24:56.912
[both grunting]

25:05.754 --> 25:06.588
[panting]

25:21.311 --> 25:22.938
[Danny grunts]

25:34.741 --> 25:36.034
[Davos grunts]

25:45.710 --> 25:47.087
[yells]

25:48.630 --> 25:50.048
[panting]

25:50.131 --> 25:51.007
[yells]

26:09.317 --> 26:11.319
[panting]

26:17.242 --> 26:18.952
[both yelling]

26:21.913 --> 26:24.332
[Danny yells in pain]

26:34.175 --> 26:35.176
Yield. Yield.

26:45.895 --> 26:47.230
Why won't you yield?

26:48.148 --> 26:51.484
It's over, Danny. Why won't you yield?

26:58.491 --> 26:59.492
[Danny grunting]

27:16.968 --> 27:18.970
[gasping]

27:44.663 --> 27:45.955
Where's the car?

27:46.039 --> 27:47.040
It's on the way.

27:47.123 --> 27:48.416
Did you call Acquisitions?

27:48.500 --> 27:51.127
Yes, Mr. Meachum.
They can't make sense of it, either.

27:51.211 --> 27:52.671
Who else did you call?

27:55.131 --> 27:56.466
You said "either."

27:56.549 --> 27:59.469
Oh. No, I just meant it
as in "them and me."

27:59.552 --> 28:01.096
And I asked for your opinion?

28:01.888 --> 28:03.765
These assholes have no clue
what she's up to,

28:03.848 --> 28:06.518
and they've done Joy's taxes
the last seven years?

28:06.601 --> 28:09.688
Acquisitions did say that the patents
in her divestment package

28:09.771 --> 28:12.982
were patents
that Rand acquired defensively.

28:13.066 --> 28:16.027
Most of which are defunct.
Which makes no sense.

28:16.111 --> 28:17.404
Again with the peanut gallery.

28:17.487 --> 28:19.656
Where did you go
to business school again, Katie?

28:19.739 --> 28:20.615
Wharton.

28:21.658 --> 28:24.160
That must have cost
a good chunk of change.

28:24.244 --> 28:25.954
You would think they would teach you

28:26.037 --> 28:29.958
that when someone divests from
your company, they are your competition.

28:32.252 --> 28:33.586
[sighs]

28:34.587 --> 28:35.755
[inhales deeply]

28:36.548 --> 28:37.590
I'm sorry.

28:38.508 --> 28:41.261
I'm not an asshole boss. I promise.

28:42.887 --> 28:44.472
Just preoccupied.

28:45.765 --> 28:47.726
Been a bad day and a bad week.

28:49.102 --> 28:51.604
All I was saying is
I didn't have to graduate from Wharton

28:51.688 --> 28:54.399
to know that the operative word
in junk patents is "junk."

28:58.111 --> 29:00.488
My guess is they're not all junk.

29:00.572 --> 29:03.783
She doesn't want me to know which ones.
So we have to know.

29:04.367 --> 29:05.410
Yes, Mr. Meachum.

29:05.493 --> 29:07.287
You find out where she's gonna be tonight?

29:07.370 --> 29:11.750
All I was able to get out of her assistant
is that she is attending an event at...

29:11.833 --> 29:13.293
Bailey's Auction House.

29:13.877 --> 29:15.920
Good work, Katie. And my schedule?

29:16.004 --> 29:17.839
-Wide open.
-Okay.

29:17.922 --> 29:21.134
One more thing. Anyone asks
about my schedule, even me,

29:21.217 --> 29:25.430
from now on you say, "Jam-packed" or,
"Packed to the gills, as usual..."

29:25.513 --> 29:28.600
I'm glad to throw in a "batshit crazy"
if you'd like.

29:28.683 --> 29:29.684
Oh!

29:30.393 --> 29:31.811
I do like that.

29:46.367 --> 29:47.827
Not a bad turnout, actually.

29:47.911 --> 29:50.663
I guess a double major in fine art
and comparative religion

29:50.747 --> 29:52.081
is good for something.

29:52.165 --> 29:54.459
You've come a long way
since those mixers at Pierson.

29:54.542 --> 29:55.460
[chuckles]

29:55.543 --> 29:58.171
You always liked them better
after a fifth of cheap vodka.

29:58.254 --> 30:00.924
[chuckles] Said the devil on my shoulder.

30:01.007 --> 30:03.384
-Said the angel on mine.
-[chuckles]

30:04.844 --> 30:08.723
You seem more you
than you've been... maybe ever.

30:09.599 --> 30:10.642
Thank you.

30:11.976 --> 30:12.977
I'm...

30:13.812 --> 30:17.732
I'm reaching for things
that I was afraid to before.

30:18.483 --> 30:22.195
And is, uh, Davis part of that equation?

30:22.695 --> 30:24.405
[chuckles softly] Davos.

30:25.156 --> 30:26.241
We're not a thing.

30:26.324 --> 30:28.576
But we've been
working on a thing together.

30:29.369 --> 30:32.080
He's a little overly intense,
but I like it.

30:32.163 --> 30:36.417
[chuckles] No. Intense
doesn't even begin to do it justice.

30:36.501 --> 30:38.586
-He's all kinds of wound up.
-Hmm.

30:38.670 --> 30:39.921
[Mika] You wouldn't mind?

30:40.463 --> 30:41.464
Knock yourself out.

30:41.548 --> 30:43.716
-But word to the wise...
-Uh-huh.

30:44.259 --> 30:48.346
He doesn't drink, eat meat, party,
or make small talk.

30:49.639 --> 30:51.391
[Mika laughs]

30:53.309 --> 30:55.311
[indistinct chatter]

30:58.940 --> 31:01.693
So this is what you wanted
all that cash for.

31:01.776 --> 31:03.361
To blow it on home decor.

31:05.530 --> 31:06.781
Antiquities.

31:06.865 --> 31:10.076
Yeah, I recognize some of them
from the Rand board.

31:10.159 --> 31:13.454
-[chuckles]
-Isn't that Mika Prada?

31:13.538 --> 31:15.540
Don't you hate her with a passion?

31:15.623 --> 31:20.378
She screwed, like...
three of your college boyfriends.

31:20.461 --> 31:22.130
And your favorite professor.

31:22.213 --> 31:24.132
Or was the professor
one of the boyfriends?

31:24.215 --> 31:25.425
What are you doing here, Ward?

31:25.508 --> 31:28.469
Bidding on the Tibetan thang-ka
of my dreams.

31:29.053 --> 31:31.890
-You won't return my calls.
-So take a hint.

31:34.058 --> 31:35.977
I just wanna talk to my sister.

31:36.644 --> 31:39.522
How did you even know
I was gonna be here?

31:39.606 --> 31:42.817
My new assistant's been badgering
your new assistant for a week.

31:42.901 --> 31:44.444
I guess yours has a heart.

31:44.527 --> 31:47.864
Well, I hope it pays her rent
as well as the job she used to have.

31:47.947 --> 31:49.198
[inhales sharply]

31:50.617 --> 31:52.201
-Enjoy the auction.
-Hey.

31:52.285 --> 31:56.623
The junk patent thing?
Don't think you're tricking anybody.

31:56.706 --> 31:59.626
[breathes deeply]
Well, I already got them out.

31:59.709 --> 32:02.962
So, yeah, past tense
would work better for you there.

32:03.046 --> 32:07.300
Look. Whatever you're playing at here,
it's not gonna work.

32:08.051 --> 32:09.177
Let me help you.

32:09.761 --> 32:13.097
I might be a terrible brother, but I do
know how to write a business plan.

32:13.181 --> 32:14.599
[clicks tongue] Aw.

32:14.682 --> 32:15.808
Wait a minute.

32:16.517 --> 32:18.353
Is this the "making amends" step?

32:19.228 --> 32:22.941
Yeah. It's just you're not doing
the very best job.

32:27.612 --> 32:29.113
Who told you I was in NA?

32:30.156 --> 32:31.157
Not you.

32:31.783 --> 32:35.453
'Cause telling me the truth would take
more balls than you have ever had.

32:36.204 --> 32:37.872
-Joy.
-Ward.

32:37.956 --> 32:41.376
Seriously. I was going to tell you that.

32:41.459 --> 32:42.710
[Joy] Mmm-hmm.

32:42.794 --> 32:43.962
Is everything okay?

32:46.172 --> 32:47.799
It's just my brother, Ward.

32:48.424 --> 32:51.469
So you can't call me back,
but, what, you have me followed?

32:51.552 --> 32:54.138
Be nice, Ward. Say hello to Davos.

32:58.559 --> 32:59.769
Hello, Davos.

33:03.982 --> 33:05.149
I give it a week.

33:06.985 --> 33:09.529
Your friend Mika
will show us the item now.

33:09.612 --> 33:11.364
Unless you are busy here.

33:11.447 --> 33:15.576
No, no. My brother and I have exhausted
all our topics of conversation.

33:15.660 --> 33:17.370
Him, him and him.

33:21.457 --> 33:24.252
[Mika] The Erskine collection
is a treasure trove.

33:24.961 --> 33:26.754
Most of the items are one of a kind.

33:26.838 --> 33:29.799
Many of historical
and sociological interest.

33:30.341 --> 33:32.468
[Joy] And pricey. Don't forget about that.

33:32.552 --> 33:35.638
[Mika chuckles] Of course.
Mama has to pay the rent.

33:36.639 --> 33:38.975
We have more questions
about this one than answers.

33:40.101 --> 33:41.436
It's quite remarkable.

33:41.519 --> 33:45.273
As if Bronze Age techniques
were used in a modern setting.

33:45.940 --> 33:48.693
No. Whoa! You can't touch it.

33:49.736 --> 33:51.904
We haven't even begun
the restoration process.

33:51.988 --> 33:54.073
The oils on your skin
could damage the glaze.

33:54.157 --> 33:57.118
I want no restoration. I need it as it is.

33:58.077 --> 34:01.748
It hasn't been priced yet. But trust me,
it's outside your price range.

34:02.790 --> 34:04.042
Well, how about mine?

34:05.043 --> 34:07.295
Since when did you
become a collector?

34:07.378 --> 34:09.922
I'm not. No, it's just this one piece.

34:11.007 --> 34:12.175
It speaks to me.

34:14.218 --> 34:16.679
If you're serious,
I can talk to my partners

34:16.763 --> 34:19.015
about holding off
on the restoration process.

34:19.098 --> 34:23.478
-It comes up for auction in three months.
-But we need it now. Tonight.

34:25.396 --> 34:28.441
And I want world peace
and marijuana legal in all 50 states.

34:28.524 --> 34:29.984
-Excuse me.
-[chuckles] Yeah.

34:36.574 --> 34:38.409
[whispering] Don't even think about it.

34:38.493 --> 34:40.453
Our plan doesn't work without it.

34:40.536 --> 34:42.497
Noted. Handled.

34:43.998 --> 34:45.541
What can I show you next?

34:45.625 --> 34:50.505
Mmm. Well, another glass of champagne
would be nice. [chuckles]

34:58.721 --> 35:00.098
You saw Yang?

35:01.390 --> 35:03.184
Let me guess. It didn't go well.

35:04.727 --> 35:06.729
No, it didn't.

35:08.481 --> 35:11.442
The bad blood between the Tigers
and the Hatchets runs deep.

35:11.526 --> 35:12.693
Years.

35:14.028 --> 35:16.989
And now, the Tigers have thrown
gasoline on the fire,

35:17.073 --> 35:19.784
and Yang's not gonna lose face
by backing down.

35:21.786 --> 35:25.498
I think he's about to make a very,
very big move against the Tigers.

35:28.584 --> 35:31.504
Bigger than hacking a man to death
on the streets?

35:32.296 --> 35:35.550
I saw those kids from the restaurant.
They said as much.

35:35.633 --> 35:37.385
They didn't try anything, did they?

35:37.468 --> 35:39.512
No, no. It wasn't like that.

35:40.471 --> 35:43.891
Well, I mean, yeah, it was. But...
they have no skin in the game, okay?

35:43.975 --> 35:46.978
They're just trying to get by
on a day-to-day basis.

35:47.854 --> 35:50.231
You should see the way they live, Danny.
They just...

35:51.482 --> 35:56.320
This city... lets people
fall through the cracks.

35:58.573 --> 36:00.116
They mention anything specific?

36:00.908 --> 36:04.162
Only that the Hatchets are gonna
wipe the Tigers off the map.

36:05.246 --> 36:07.582
Any clue as to where, when?

36:07.665 --> 36:11.377
No. And I'm guessing going
back to Yang is a nonstarter?

36:12.962 --> 36:14.046
Yeah.

36:15.673 --> 36:17.091
I burned that bridge.

36:21.512 --> 36:24.432
He may not be the only Yang
we can appeal to.

36:27.310 --> 36:29.312
[indistinct chatter]

36:39.780 --> 36:42.325
I thought you said this was
a charity event.

36:42.408 --> 36:43.951
Yeah, it is.

36:44.035 --> 36:46.621
Sam mentioned it might not be
on the up-and-up.

36:46.704 --> 36:50.291
Okay, over at the pai gow table
with the Aunties, that's Sherry Yang.

36:50.374 --> 36:52.501
I've seen her at the center,
but never spoken to her.

36:53.085 --> 36:54.587
No time like the present.

37:03.137 --> 37:04.931
Mrs. Yang? Sorry to interrupt.

37:05.014 --> 37:08.059
My name is Colleen Wing.
This is Danny Rand.

37:08.142 --> 37:11.771
This is a high-stakes table, dear.
I saw some room over at fan-tan.

37:19.820 --> 37:21.864
[chair scraping]

37:21.948 --> 37:26.494
Hi. We need to talk. In private or not,
that's up to you. But it's important.

37:26.577 --> 37:28.746
I'm on a bit of a hot streak.
Perhaps another time.

37:28.829 --> 37:30.331
[Colleen] It's about the Golden Tigers.

37:30.414 --> 37:32.833
I'm not sure what that is.
Some sort of breakfast cereal?

37:32.917 --> 37:33.876
[Colleen scoffs]

37:33.960 --> 37:36.879
I met with your husband today.
Maybe he mentioned our meeting?

37:36.963 --> 37:40.049
Hai-Qing and I don't clutter our marriage
with talk of work.

37:40.758 --> 37:42.051
But you have his ear.

37:42.134 --> 37:44.303
All we're asking is that you listen to us.

37:53.896 --> 37:56.232
You volunteer here, Ms. Wing, yes?

37:56.315 --> 37:58.192
Is that a position you'd like to keep?

37:58.276 --> 38:01.988
[chuckles softly] I do volunteer here.

38:02.071 --> 38:04.740
Which means I know how much you do
for the people of this community.

38:04.824 --> 38:06.742
And that I worked very hard
to organize an event

38:06.826 --> 38:08.828
that you are in danger of spoiling.

38:08.911 --> 38:12.748
Your husband is organizing a big move
against the Golden Tigers.

38:12.832 --> 38:16.544
We'd like you to convince him to consider
negotiation instead of war.

38:16.627 --> 38:19.547
A parley. Each side sitting
across the same table.

38:21.757 --> 38:22.883
It's too late.

38:26.804 --> 38:29.265
There is a memorial service this evening

38:30.057 --> 38:32.685
for the Golden Tigers' fallen soldier.

38:32.768 --> 38:33.769
[Danny scoffs]

38:34.562 --> 38:35.771
"Blood for blood."

38:36.480 --> 38:40.234
It wasn't a hit this morning, was it?
It was a way to draw out leadership.

38:40.318 --> 38:42.069
You have to make him call it off.

38:42.153 --> 38:43.571
"Make him"?

38:44.655 --> 38:47.491
I don't pretend to understand
the intricacies of your life.

38:48.200 --> 38:50.995
But whatever responsibility
you think you have to your husband,

38:51.078 --> 38:53.247
you have an equal one to this place
and the people in it.

38:53.331 --> 38:56.042
We all do good in different ways,
Mrs. Yang.

38:56.125 --> 38:57.209
I volunteer here.

38:57.293 --> 38:59.795
You invite your moneyed friends
to come and bet a fortune,

38:59.879 --> 39:01.714
knowing most will lose that money
to the house.

39:01.797 --> 39:04.091
[chuckles softly] You know your pai gow.

39:04.175 --> 39:06.927
I know that at one point in time,
your husband stood with us

39:07.011 --> 39:09.013
against a common enemy and did good.

39:09.680 --> 39:11.015
Which means there is good in him.

39:11.098 --> 39:13.142
If anyone can remind him of that,
it's you.

39:13.225 --> 39:16.771
Whatever he's done,
make him call it off. Insist.

39:16.854 --> 39:20.941
Negotiation instead of war. It's on you.

39:27.406 --> 39:28.324
Leave me.

39:38.876 --> 39:39.877
Nicely done.

39:39.960 --> 39:42.046
[sighs] It isn't done yet.

39:43.130 --> 39:46.884
I said I wanted to walk another path.
Here it is.

39:46.967 --> 39:48.427
What if it doesn't work?

39:49.845 --> 39:51.472
Then we do what we have to.

39:52.890 --> 39:54.475
Stop them by force.

40:08.072 --> 40:10.116
[Joy and Mika laughing]

40:14.620 --> 40:15.913
Come on, Davis.

40:15.996 --> 40:18.207
-[Joy chuckles] You're terrible.
-I know.

40:19.458 --> 40:21.001
Don't sit so far away.

40:21.752 --> 40:24.380
I think he likes the attention.

40:25.214 --> 40:26.632
In spite of himself.

40:29.760 --> 40:31.429
-I'm dry...
-I'm not.

40:32.763 --> 40:34.807
[Joy and Mika laugh]

40:36.725 --> 40:39.061
[Joy clears throat and sighs]

40:45.317 --> 40:46.652
[Joy quietly] Mika's married.

40:47.278 --> 40:51.073
Her husband is a congressman
running for reelection.

40:51.157 --> 40:56.120
I think she would do just about anything
to prevent a scandal.

40:57.079 --> 41:01.917
But in order for that to work,
we need something scandalous.

41:03.794 --> 41:06.881
[quietly] This tactic, it's distasteful.

41:08.340 --> 41:10.968
But it's a tactic nonetheless.

41:12.720 --> 41:16.390
You want this bowl,
you gotta ask yourself...

41:17.349 --> 41:20.227
is your code of honor
more important than your purpose?

41:22.521 --> 41:23.522
Besides,

41:24.064 --> 41:26.775
it's not torture we're talking about here.

41:28.110 --> 41:29.403
It's sex.

41:33.991 --> 41:35.701
[Joy and Mika giggle]

41:37.244 --> 41:41.207
Aw. He really hates this, doesn't he?

41:45.085 --> 41:50.424
I think there are parts of him
that might disagree.

41:53.427 --> 41:54.887
I'm gonna get some air.

41:57.264 --> 41:58.265
[Joy clears throat] Ah.

42:07.733 --> 42:09.026
All alone.

42:10.903 --> 42:11.904
Hmm?

42:18.285 --> 42:20.371
You really can't stand me, can you?

42:44.436 --> 42:46.730
[Davos breathing heavily]

43:03.455 --> 43:05.666
[Mika groaning]

43:12.881 --> 43:15.259
-Come on, now.
-[breathing heavily]

43:15.342 --> 43:16.510
Come on.

43:17.928 --> 43:18.929
Do it.

43:21.682 --> 43:24.685
[breathing heavily] Harder.

43:27.605 --> 43:28.522
[groaning]

43:55.966 --> 43:57.092
Oh, man.

43:57.635 --> 43:59.803
I'm gonna throw a record on
and cook some noodles.

43:59.887 --> 44:01.096
You want some?

44:01.180 --> 44:07.394
No, no. I just... I want a shower.
And sleep. Lots of sleep.

44:10.981 --> 44:12.274
We did good tonight.

44:14.943 --> 44:16.403
Yeah, we did.

44:17.905 --> 44:23.243
Hopefully now we can just
get back to some semblance of normalcy.

44:24.328 --> 44:29.458
Well, if there is a parley,
Chinatown can sleep easy again.

44:30.542 --> 44:33.420
But for now, we prevented a slaughter.

44:36.131 --> 44:37.549
I'll take that victory.

44:39.718 --> 44:40.719
Okay.

44:45.891 --> 44:48.686
[music starts playing]

44:51.271 --> 44:52.272
[sighs]

45:05.202 --> 45:07.371
-[Danny grunting]
-[Davos] It's over, Danny.

45:12.751 --> 45:13.752
Yield. Yield!

45:21.385 --> 45:23.595
[both panting]

45:32.187 --> 45:35.482
Danny, it's over. You can't run forever.

45:40.070 --> 45:42.072
[both grunting]

45:43.490 --> 45:46.994
[panting] I'm not running. I'm leading.

45:58.547 --> 45:59.381
[yells]

46:04.261 --> 46:06.096
[both struggling]

46:07.097 --> 46:09.349
-Will you yield?
-[Davos groans]

46:09.433 --> 46:10.517
Yield!

46:16.607 --> 46:18.358
[panting]

46:23.030 --> 46:24.656
[Thunderer] Daniel Rand-K'ai...

46:26.700 --> 46:28.786
will face the dragon.

47:15.123 --> 47:17.125
[record player skipping] [indistinct chatter]

47:27.845 --> 47:29.721
[Yang] Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

47:29.805 --> 47:32.140
Tell me the shipment arrived early.

47:36.395 --> 47:38.063
[Yang] I'm returning your money.

47:38.647 --> 47:40.190
I don't understand.

47:40.774 --> 47:43.026
I can no longer guarantee delivery.

47:43.110 --> 47:47.447
I am renegotiating my hold on this port
and shipments that come through it.

47:47.990 --> 47:50.701
Today is not the day to test me, Mr. Yang.

47:51.743 --> 47:53.161
I have made sacrifices.

47:53.245 --> 47:57.666
I am doing this to prevent
an open war with my rivals.

47:58.625 --> 48:00.627
[breathes deeply]

48:03.964 --> 48:05.799
This is about making peace?

48:06.633 --> 48:08.969
[smacks lips] It is.

48:16.059 --> 48:17.895
Then I am honored to know you.

48:29.781 --> 48:31.450
You have a good day, Mr. Yang.

48:51.887 --> 48:53.096
[gasping]

49:03.482 --> 49:05.859
[telephone ringing]

49:05.943 --> 49:06.944
Hello?

49:10.238 --> 49:12.532
<i>Hello? Who is this?</i>

49:13.325 --> 49:14.868
Is Danny there?

49:15.619 --> 49:18.205
Uh, no, he's out.

49:20.165 --> 49:22.417
Mary, is that you?

49:23.627 --> 49:25.462
Um, I shouldn't have called.

49:27.339 --> 49:28.340
[line disconnects]

49:44.940 --> 49:45.899
[breathing deeply]
