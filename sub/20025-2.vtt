WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:01.434
.

00:07.807 --> 00:12.245
Six years ago, the Geordie squad
first got together.

00:15.749 --> 00:17.650
But it's not all been one big party.

00:17.717 --> 00:18.718
Back to work.

00:19.719 --> 00:22.122
We had to work for
that wrinkly fuck, Anna.

00:23.990 --> 00:26.192
We fucking nailed it.

00:26.793 --> 00:29.195
# Any cock's good
But it's cock, cock, cock #

00:31.231 --> 00:34.200
We've only gone and made
her business a global success.

00:35.402 --> 00:38.905
So, now, the squad is expanding.

00:38.972 --> 00:41.107
Oi, oi!
Hello!

00:41.174 --> 00:44.077
Hiya!
(cheering)

00:49.549 --> 00:53.253
I'm not gonna be able to
keep yous all on full time.

00:53.319 --> 00:55.889
We need to help Anna decide
who stays...

00:57.357 --> 01:00.160
...and who goes.
(cheering)

01:00.226 --> 01:03.263
The only thing
we give a shit about is...

01:03.329 --> 01:05.298
...are they fucking radge enough...

01:05.364 --> 01:08.067
...to join this crazy family?

01:13.807 --> 01:15.775
Let wuh fucking gan.

01:16.509 --> 01:20.280
So far, Anna has sent Abbie,
Sarah and Zahida for us

01:20.346 --> 01:23.583
to put through their paces.
Let's get this party started!

01:24.484 --> 01:25.785
You know why, though!

01:25.852 --> 01:29.088
Having my ex bird Sarah here
has totally fried my head!

01:29.155 --> 01:32.992
I've got nae chance of doing nowt
with Chloe and my ex bird in here.

01:34.093 --> 01:38.932
Out of all the new workers, Abbie
has caught my eye straight away.

01:38.998 --> 01:42.602
I did think that Martin fingered
Zahida, so I told me pal Chloe.

01:44.270 --> 01:46.573
And I went fucking berserk with her.

01:48.174 --> 01:50.210
Which is a disgrace, even for me.

01:50.276 --> 01:51.644
Fuck that shit!

01:51.711 --> 01:55.248
I'm so upset.
I just want to go home.

01:58.852 --> 02:00.787
I should have a degree in pulling.

02:00.854 --> 02:03.122
Never kiss anyone with no six-pack.

02:03.189 --> 02:05.859
I'm a natural beauty.
Real boobs, real hair.

02:05.925 --> 02:08.294
I'm gonna tear the place up.

02:08.360 --> 02:10.395
I'm preened to perfection.

02:10.463 --> 02:12.799
I'm totally crackers, me, like.

02:12.866 --> 02:15.668
I'm cheeky, colourful
and full of mischief.

02:15.735 --> 02:18.605
I can talk the back legs
off a donkey.

02:18.671 --> 02:22.342
Me quiff's pure lethal
and me banter's pure naughty.

02:22.408 --> 02:24.811
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

02:40.760 --> 02:43.930
One word, wow.
I know, it was crazy, wasn't it?

02:43.997 --> 02:47.800
All I seen was weave and legs
flying. I feel so bad, me.

02:47.867 --> 02:50.103
I don't know what got into me
last night,

02:50.169 --> 02:53.106
but I know that I feel so, so bad
about it this morning.

02:53.172 --> 02:55.942
I should never, ever have
raised my hands to Zahida.

02:56.009 --> 02:57.343
What the fuck happened?

02:57.410 --> 02:59.812
Zahida was flirting with Martin
in the taxi.

02:59.879 --> 03:02.482
What happened when we got in?
I kicked off.

03:02.549 --> 03:04.450
Last night was all my fault.

03:04.517 --> 03:06.853
I'm pretty sure
I seen Zahida get fingered,

03:06.920 --> 03:09.622
but I feel like I've caused
a bit too much drama.

03:09.689 --> 03:12.258
I need to speak to Zahida
and apologise.

03:12.325 --> 03:14.661
I don't know what Anna's
got in store,

03:14.727 --> 03:18.965
but I know Chloe needs to apologise
to Zahida and actually mean it.

03:21.568 --> 03:25.405
How's everyone feeling?
We drank a lot yesterday.

03:25.471 --> 03:29.742
I've woken up, and all I can think
about is that fight last night.

03:29.809 --> 03:32.278
Hands down,
I've seen a lot of fights in here,

03:32.345 --> 03:34.480
that is the worst I've ever seen.

03:34.547 --> 03:37.850
I just still cannot believe
that Chloe bounced in

03:37.917 --> 03:41.421
saying I was porking Zahida
in the back of a fucking taxi.

03:41.487 --> 03:44.524
I knew it was too good to be true
Chloe not kicking off.

03:44.591 --> 03:47.160
She couldn't last two nights.

03:47.226 --> 03:49.295
Marnie stuck up for the new girls

03:49.362 --> 03:52.465
and I didn't actually think
that would ever happen.

03:52.532 --> 03:54.467
That was quite surprising.

03:54.534 --> 03:58.137
We've got no idea how many
new workers Anna is sending in,

03:58.204 --> 04:01.541
but so far, whatever she's up to
has had a massive impact.

04:01.608 --> 04:05.178
Shotgun not getting the coffees.
Shotgun... Shotgun not.

04:05.244 --> 04:08.481
Shotgun not getting coffees.
Marty's on the coffee run.

04:10.850 --> 04:12.785
Ah, I don't wanna go back in.
I know.

04:12.852 --> 04:16.689
This is not how I expected to be
waking up on my first morning.

04:16.755 --> 04:19.926
Last night, all I wanted to do
was make a good impression,

04:19.993 --> 04:21.527
and it ended up in a fight.

04:22.895 --> 04:23.896
Hi, girls.

04:23.963 --> 04:27.200
Here come Chloe and Sophie.
Hope they're not up for round two.

04:27.266 --> 04:29.602
I didn't want a boxing match
this morning.

04:29.669 --> 04:33.773
I just want to apologise
for my behaviour last night.

04:33.840 --> 04:39.245
The word fingering was getting
thrown around. I wasn't.

04:39.312 --> 04:42.248
After what I did to Zahida
on her first night,

04:42.315 --> 04:45.385
I feel like she's not gonna
forgive us. I hope she does.

04:45.451 --> 04:48.454
All I can say is I apologise
for raising my hands at you.

04:48.521 --> 04:51.858
I apologise for getting it wrong.
Disgusting behaviour.

04:51.924 --> 04:53.459
I want you to have a good time.

04:53.526 --> 04:55.662
What a first night.
I know.

04:55.728 --> 04:57.063
We're good people.

04:57.130 --> 05:01.200
To be fair, it takes a bigger person
to admit they were out of order.

05:01.267 --> 05:03.202
It's probably best to move on.

05:03.269 --> 05:06.005
I really want to stay
and prove myself.

05:06.072 --> 05:08.508
We're gonna go inside.
Come in.

05:08.574 --> 05:11.377
Whenever yous wanna come in.
In a minute. In a sec.

05:11.444 --> 05:13.813
Help yourself to the fridge,
but no nuggets.

05:13.880 --> 05:17.183
Us Geordies fight, we argue,
we call each other awful words.

05:17.250 --> 05:20.086
But we make up the next day.
Let's go and get some pop.

05:27.326 --> 05:28.728
See that?
Oh!

05:35.568 --> 05:39.372
We're all sat round, hungover,
making an effort with the new girls.

05:39.439 --> 05:41.441
We've all done it
on the first night.

05:41.507 --> 05:44.677
Fucking hell, first night,
I pissed myself, me.

05:45.545 --> 05:50.249
Hiya.
Here she is to ruin the day. Anna.

05:50.316 --> 05:52.652
Can I get everybody down here?

05:53.352 --> 05:55.188
Lads?
Now.

05:55.254 --> 05:57.623
Anna's arrived,
and she does not look happy.

05:57.690 --> 06:01.327
I've done nowt wrong last night,
but still my asshole is twitching.

06:01.394 --> 06:06.966
Now you're all here, I heard
what happened back here last night.

06:07.033 --> 06:11.504
In all my time here,
I've never seen Anna look this angry.

06:11.571 --> 06:13.339
What the hell have I done?

06:13.406 --> 06:16.909
Sophie. Chloe. Yous were fighting.

06:16.976 --> 06:19.612
You all right?
I'm fine. We've talked about it.

06:19.679 --> 06:21.681
I'm not holding a grudge about it.

06:21.748 --> 06:25.284
We're sitting on the sofa
and it's proper fucking awkward.

06:25.351 --> 06:28.287
What kind of example are you
setting? It is disgusting.

06:28.354 --> 06:31.858
We have apologised and I do feel
very regretful for what I've done.

06:31.924 --> 06:33.893
I don't want to see it again.

06:33.960 --> 06:37.930
So tonight, you can stay here
and clean up this absolute dump.

06:37.997 --> 06:38.998
OK.
OK?

06:39.065 --> 06:42.168
Fair enough, Anna,
I did deserve that.

06:42.235 --> 06:46.405
Chloe, your behaviour
was totally unacceptable.

06:46.472 --> 06:48.407
You've left me no choice.

06:48.474 --> 06:52.945
I need to send you home to think
about how you treat other people.

06:53.012 --> 06:54.180
OK?

06:54.247 --> 06:57.316
Hopefully Chloe realises
she can't kick off all the time.

06:57.383 --> 07:01.654
And I'll decide
if and when you come back, OK?

07:01.721 --> 07:03.289
I'm gonna go with her.

07:03.356 --> 07:06.759
Have a good think about it.
See ya later.

07:08.995 --> 07:12.999
Like, all I wanna do is come in here,
right, have a good time.

07:13.065 --> 07:14.500
With me friends.

07:14.567 --> 07:17.703
Losing me job over a stupid fight,
it's so disgusting.

07:17.770 --> 07:20.039
I feel like I've really
let down the family.

07:20.106 --> 07:23.576
Everyone's gonna think
I'm a proper disgrace. (sniffs)

07:23.643 --> 07:26.679
Please learn your lesson.
I love you so much.

07:26.746 --> 07:30.483
Although I love Chloe to pieces,
I'm happy she's getting sent home.

07:30.550 --> 07:33.019
Cos last night,
that wasn't my best friend.

07:33.085 --> 07:35.288
I don't even know
who the fuck that was.

07:37.723 --> 07:41.694
I'll be gutted if Chloe doesn't
come back. I feel it's cos of me.

07:51.304 --> 07:53.372
I'm going to the gym. Coming? Marty?

07:57.009 --> 07:59.745
It probably is a good thing
we're going to the gym.

07:59.812 --> 08:02.982
I'm the type of kid
that's a skinny fat person.

08:03.049 --> 08:04.183
And it's not cool.

08:06.452 --> 08:09.822
The only time Marty squats
is when he goes for a shit.

08:09.889 --> 08:11.891
Mate, you're gonna struggle today.

08:19.565 --> 08:22.268
This house is an absolute mess.

08:22.335 --> 08:24.103
Fuck sake, Anna.

08:24.170 --> 08:25.571
I know I fucked up,

08:25.638 --> 08:28.441
but making us clean
a fucking shower full of pubes?

08:28.507 --> 08:30.676
I really hope these guys
appreciate it.

08:39.452 --> 08:42.722
Aah! No way.
I'm not fucking doing it.

08:43.155 --> 08:46.292
Hold it there, hold it there. Push.
Aah!

08:46.359 --> 08:50.096
Marty's struggling, and I'm not
surprised. That kid's diet is pop,

08:50.162 --> 08:51.764
crisps and bread.

08:51.831 --> 08:55.067
Aah!
Go on. Keep your back straight.

08:55.134 --> 08:58.571
How isn't it straight?
I should know, it's my back.

08:58.638 --> 09:01.040
I knew taking Marty to the gym
was a bad idea.

09:01.107 --> 09:04.410
But we've got three new birds
and two of them are single,

09:04.477 --> 09:06.212
so we need a plan for tonight.

09:06.279 --> 09:09.282
Mate, I actually think
Chloe not being there tonight,

09:09.348 --> 09:11.884
there'll be nae kick-offs.
Sophie's not out.

09:11.951 --> 09:13.886
There's nae one there to kick off.

09:13.953 --> 09:16.088
Flirt and crack on with Sarah more.

09:16.155 --> 09:19.258
Having me ex bird Sarah in the house
is making us realise

09:19.325 --> 09:21.160
how much of a laugh we used to have.

09:21.227 --> 09:23.896
And part of us is wishing
I never fucked things up.

09:23.963 --> 09:27.900
I think you'll be able to get
with Abbie as well. Abbie is fit.

09:27.967 --> 09:30.970
I'll have a bit of a flirt,
then we'll see what happens.

09:32.605 --> 09:34.607
Hold it, hold it.
Aah!

09:34.674 --> 09:38.177
Oh, hang on, me arse. Swear down
I've pulled a muscle in me arse.

09:38.244 --> 09:40.379
I swear to God.
(laughs)

09:40.446 --> 09:42.815
Fucking hell,
Marty's pulled an arse cheek.

09:42.882 --> 09:45.251
We best head home
before he ends up in A&amp;E.

09:45.318 --> 09:46.319
Howay, then.

09:57.863 --> 09:59.131
Sophie?

09:59.198 --> 10:02.768
We get back from the gym and,
fuck me, Sophie's done a wicked job.

10:02.835 --> 10:05.638
I could actually eat me scran
off the deck.

10:08.808 --> 10:10.609
How was the gym?
Good.

10:10.676 --> 10:12.611
Did you work out?
Course I did.

10:12.678 --> 10:13.813
The boys are back,

10:13.879 --> 10:17.183
and Marty, the fat little pig,
has worked up an appetite.

10:17.249 --> 10:21.120
I'm just glad the mood in the house
is better than this morning.

10:21.187 --> 10:23.422
I've got a good feeling
about tonight.

10:23.489 --> 10:26.292
It's gonna be a good night.
Everyone go get ready.

10:26.359 --> 10:29.729
Tonight should be drama free,
especially with Sophie

10:29.795 --> 10:33.232
and Chloe not in the picture.
Let's just fucking smash it.

10:39.805 --> 10:41.907
Marnie and Nathan look so glamorous.

10:41.974 --> 10:44.677
Me on the other hand,
I feel like fucking Cinderella

10:44.744 --> 10:48.080
looking at the ugly sisters
getting ready for the ball.

10:48.147 --> 10:51.617
Oh, my God, you should have seen
what was in the shower. (groans)

10:51.684 --> 10:55.888
It looked like the insides
of an arsehole. Ugh.

10:55.955 --> 10:58.324
I'm gutted that Sophie's staying in,

10:58.391 --> 11:01.060
but I'm dead excited to wear
my new gnashers out.

11:01.127 --> 11:03.029
What do you think?

11:04.130 --> 11:05.664
Oh.

11:05.731 --> 11:09.802
If the electricity went out, it'd
be fine with his teeth. (laughs)

11:10.970 --> 11:13.906
Tonight, Abbie, Sarah.
(laughs)

11:13.973 --> 11:16.208
I'm all up for flirting with Abbie.

11:16.275 --> 11:18.844
It'd be interesting
to see Marnie's reaction.

11:18.911 --> 11:21.080
I know for a fact
she'd fucking hate it.

11:26.986 --> 11:28.621
I'll go, "Marnie, come here."

11:28.687 --> 11:31.357
"I was wondering, would you
actually be pissed off

11:31.424 --> 11:33.626
if Aaron got with someone else?"

11:33.692 --> 11:37.363
We shouldn't be asking Marnie,
cos she hasn't got a leg to stand on.

11:37.430 --> 11:40.766
In a relationship, you don't
get jealous at anybody else.

11:40.833 --> 11:42.068
I need a drink.

11:42.134 --> 11:45.237
We still don't know how many
new workers Anna's putting in.

11:45.304 --> 11:49.008
I'm excited to put these new girls
to the test in the Toon tonight.

11:49.075 --> 11:51.544
Everyone!
Sophie, gutted you're not coming.

11:51.610 --> 11:54.013
Cheers to the second night.
Girls, enjoy.

11:54.080 --> 11:57.083
(all cheer)
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

11:57.149 --> 12:00.052
Off they go,
and off to fucking bed I go.

12:00.119 --> 12:05.024
Bye, guys. I really hope you have
the shittest night of your lives.

12:12.431 --> 12:13.499
(cheering)

12:13.566 --> 12:17.736
I have to give Aaron a lap dance.
Abbie's shoving her tits in me face.

12:17.803 --> 12:18.971
Fucking amazing.

12:19.038 --> 12:21.740
Marnie, you little dickhead.

12:21.807 --> 12:25.478
Hot tub party! I need to keep my eye
on that little fucker Marty,

12:25.544 --> 12:29.115
cos at this rate, there's going to
be a race for the shag pad.

12:30.616 --> 12:32.585
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

12:34.987 --> 12:35.187
.

12:37.723 --> 12:37.923
.

12:48.767 --> 12:52.605
We get to Bijoux, and I'm buzzing to
be in the club with the new workers,

12:52.671 --> 12:56.775
cos it's another chance to see what
these girls are like on a night out.

13:02.414 --> 13:03.883
Bijoux is going off,

13:03.949 --> 13:07.353
but first let's get these newbies
trained on our traditions.

13:18.230 --> 13:22.201
Tonight I'm gonna wingman the lads
like I've never wingmanned before.

13:22.268 --> 13:24.803
But first,
I need to check with Marnie

13:24.870 --> 13:28.274
to make sure that she's not gonna
lose her shit if Aaron pulls.

13:32.678 --> 13:34.747
Come on, Gary,
I've got a man who I love.

13:34.813 --> 13:38.150
I don't give a fuck if Aaron cracks
on to any of these new workers.

13:46.692 --> 13:49.962
Marnie's given Aaron the green light
to pull other girls.

13:50.029 --> 13:53.199
I've got to go and tell Aaron
the good news.

13:55.334 --> 13:58.771
Gaz is all smiles.
Howay, man, what's the happy news?

14:04.243 --> 14:08.080
Marnie's told Gary she doesn't care
if I hook up with other girls.

14:08.147 --> 14:10.282
I'm not too sure
how I feel about this.

14:14.253 --> 14:19.225
Aaron, Marnie doesn't give a shit if
you neck on with any of these girls,

14:19.291 --> 14:20.960
so what are you waiting for?

14:22.761 --> 14:27.166
Aaron's having a wig out, I've got
an idea that'll loose him clean up.

14:27.233 --> 14:28.767
I wanna test these new girls,

14:28.834 --> 14:31.370
see how much of a laugh
they're actually up for.

14:42.314 --> 14:46.719
Loving your work, Marty.
What an idea. Testing the new girls

14:46.785 --> 14:49.855
and we're putting Abbie
on Aaron's lap.

14:58.464 --> 15:01.934
I have to give Aaron a lap dance.
He does not know what he's in for.

15:09.708 --> 15:13.279
Abbie's first up for the lap dance.
She's shoving her tits in me face

15:13.345 --> 15:15.948
and she smells fucking amazing.

15:19.118 --> 15:22.187
Abbie, move away.
Let me show you how it's done.

15:27.693 --> 15:31.530
Zahida started off strong, but
her dance was over before it begun.

15:34.233 --> 15:38.304
I cannot fucking dance. I'm about as
sexy as a bit of toast. Count me out.

15:38.971 --> 15:40.906
If Sarah wants to join this family,

15:40.973 --> 15:44.109
she's gonna have to be
a little bit more radge than that.

15:45.811 --> 15:49.348
Just cos I'm not a newbie,
doesn't mean I can't have fun.

15:49.415 --> 15:51.850
Come here.
I'll show you how it's done.

15:55.788 --> 15:58.490
Fuck me, Marnie is a pro.

15:59.792 --> 16:03.462
Marnie knows what she's doing. She's
trying to take my mind off Abbie

16:03.529 --> 16:04.863
and them massive tits.

16:04.930 --> 16:07.232
And to be honest,
it's fucking working.

16:08.334 --> 16:12.104
She's meant to have a boyfriend, and
she can't keep her hands off Aaron.

16:12.171 --> 16:14.273
Stop playing with
my mate's emotions.

16:18.243 --> 16:21.046
There you go, girls,
that's how you do it.

16:24.650 --> 16:27.619
This is why I want this job so bad.

16:27.686 --> 16:30.956
Partying with the Geordie squad
is fucking amazing.

16:39.264 --> 16:41.533
Aaron's come over
to check I'm all right.

16:41.600 --> 16:43.836
I'm much better
now I'm talking to you.

16:49.441 --> 16:53.278
I'm attracted to Abbie, but I've just
come off the back of a relationship

16:53.345 --> 16:55.614
and I'm not looking to
rush into anything.

17:03.055 --> 17:04.690
My tits smell amazing?

17:04.757 --> 17:06.492
What are you after, sunshine?

17:16.734 --> 17:19.570
Buzzing. Tonight, I'm
in the shag pad with Aaron.

17:19.637 --> 17:23.809
And that lucky fucker might be
in for a treat if he behaves.

17:28.647 --> 17:30.282
It's weird, Chloe and Sophie

17:30.349 --> 17:32.684
not being on a night out
with me and Marnie.

17:32.751 --> 17:35.888
I know they're being punished,
but I fucking miss them.

17:41.560 --> 17:42.728
That's a surprise.

17:42.795 --> 17:46.231
Martin's saying really nice things
about when we were together.

17:56.175 --> 17:59.545
I've been waiting to tell Sarah
all night how I've been feeling,

17:59.611 --> 18:02.948
cos when we were good, we were
really good and I've missed her.

18:05.717 --> 18:07.319
Eyelash on my cheek?

18:07.386 --> 18:09.922
Marty used that
the first time we necked on.

18:09.988 --> 18:12.124
He obviously hasn't
changed his ways.

18:23.068 --> 18:26.371
I'm having a good night,
enjoying hanging out with the girls,

18:26.438 --> 18:30.042
but Nathan looks really hot,
but not in the hot he thinks.

18:32.044 --> 18:35.514
Marnie, you little dickhead,
what was that for?

18:40.752 --> 18:43.422
Compared to last night,
tonight's been mint.

18:43.489 --> 18:46.692
These lot are a bunch of radgies
and I proper love them.

18:49.428 --> 18:51.196
Let's go, go, go!

18:51.263 --> 18:55.000
Tonight has been mint and I've had
a wicked time with the new workers,

18:55.067 --> 18:58.504
but it doesn't stop here.
Time to carry on the party back home.

19:11.083 --> 19:14.386
I've had a really good night,
but I've missed Sophie so much,

19:14.453 --> 19:17.189
so I'm going to check on her
and get meself to bed.

19:17.256 --> 19:19.291
Hot tub party!

19:19.358 --> 19:23.662
Hot tub? Not tonight.
I'm going straight to bed. Bye.

19:23.729 --> 19:26.265
Come on!

19:27.065 --> 19:29.401
I've got me bikini on
ready for the hot tub,

19:29.468 --> 19:32.538
I turn around,
and Martin's got his todger out!

19:32.604 --> 19:34.806
Hello, donkey, I've missed that.

19:36.475 --> 19:39.778
We're carrying on the party,
Marty's in the hot tub with Sarah

19:39.845 --> 19:43.549
and I'm in it with Abbie, but I need
to keep me eye on that fucker Marty,

19:43.615 --> 19:46.752
cos at this rate, there's gonna be
a race for the shag pad.

19:50.088 --> 19:51.823
(all yell)

19:51.890 --> 19:53.759
You fucking tramp.

19:53.825 --> 19:55.894
Enjoy stewing in the piss, Aaron.

19:55.961 --> 19:59.731
I'm going to get Sarah in that
shag pad before you even get out.

20:01.400 --> 20:04.736
Too slow, Aaron.
You snooze, you fucking lose.

20:04.803 --> 20:06.905
The shag pad is mine tonight.

20:11.276 --> 20:14.212
If Marty thinks he's getting
a bang out of me tonight,

20:14.279 --> 20:15.981
he doesn't remember very well.

20:16.048 --> 20:18.784
Everyone in Newcastle knows
I'm frigid as fuck.

20:21.086 --> 20:24.289
I've got Sarah back in the shag pad
and this feels strange.

20:24.356 --> 20:25.958
The chemistry isn't there.

20:26.024 --> 20:28.961
I never thought I'd say this,
but I don't wanna be here.

20:35.968 --> 20:38.804
I can't believe I've just used
missing Aaron and Gaz

20:38.870 --> 20:40.505
as an excuse not to be here.

20:40.572 --> 20:42.274
What the fuck is going on?

20:44.109 --> 20:47.045
After all the shit Marty's
just said to us in the club,

20:47.112 --> 20:50.415
I can't believe he's just pied us
saying he misses the boys.

20:50.482 --> 20:52.084
What a bellend.

20:52.884 --> 20:58.090
Boys! I'm back!
Hang on. What's all this?

20:58.156 --> 21:01.026
Marty must be suffering
from the floppy cock again.

21:01.093 --> 21:04.162
Me and Abbie best get in there
before something comes up.

21:06.331 --> 21:09.134
I'm so excited to be
in the shag pad with Aaron.

21:09.201 --> 21:12.671
He's so hot and I can't wait
to have a cheeky neck on.

21:16.208 --> 21:20.178
I'm necking on with Aaron, and I may
have let him slip a cheeky finger.

21:20.245 --> 21:22.681
But that's all
you're getting tonight.

21:23.682 --> 21:27.619
Don't know where this is going, but
I don't want another relationship.

21:27.686 --> 21:30.756
I think it's best to have
a conversation with Abbie.

21:39.564 --> 21:40.565
Fucking hell...

21:43.835 --> 21:47.406
Exactly. That's why
we're not having sex at all.

21:47.472 --> 21:48.974
That's why I'm not doing it.

21:49.041 --> 21:52.678
Boys are all the same
and they only want one thing.

21:52.744 --> 21:54.913
On your bike, Aaron,
you cheeky fucker.

22:11.229 --> 22:14.566
A new worker, and he's a boy!
Cheers, Anna.

22:14.633 --> 22:16.001
Hello!

22:16.068 --> 22:18.937
Whoo!
That's how you make an entrance.

22:19.004 --> 22:21.940
I need your help. I'm not
going to be taking them all on.

22:22.007 --> 22:24.643
What Anna just said
has totally changed the game.

22:24.710 --> 22:27.345
At least we've a choice
to pick who lives with us.

22:27.412 --> 22:30.916
We have the power!
I feel regal when I do that.

22:31.583 --> 22:33.585
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

22:36.488 --> 22:36.688
.

22:39.191 --> 22:39.391
.

22:59.911 --> 23:03.215
Morning, Nathan.
Morning!

23:03.281 --> 23:06.184
Last night, I didn't go out
because I had a punishment,

23:06.251 --> 23:08.587
but I can't wait to find out
all the gossip.

23:08.653 --> 23:11.957
We were doing this game, giving
Aaron a lap dance... Everyone?

23:12.023 --> 23:14.292
Yeah, all the girls.
I did it and I won.

23:14.359 --> 23:15.927
(gasps) What did you do?

23:15.994 --> 23:17.829
I think he liked it.
He went red.

23:17.896 --> 23:19.531
Did he? (gasps)

23:19.598 --> 23:23.535
Last night I showed Abbie, Sarah
and Zahida how us girls roll.

23:23.602 --> 23:27.439
With the lap dancing, they set the
bar here and I set it way up here.

23:27.506 --> 23:30.208
If we're at work tonight,
and we're with them,

23:30.275 --> 23:32.344
I'm gonna make one of them leader,

23:32.410 --> 23:34.980
I'm gonna make the other one
lead the games,

23:35.046 --> 23:37.749
and the other one can do
whatever else needs doing,

23:37.816 --> 23:40.485
and us three... stay here.

23:40.552 --> 23:43.221
If these new workers
want to be part of the family,

23:43.288 --> 23:46.525
they need to step up to the plate
and graft their arses off,

23:46.591 --> 23:49.461
especially when I'm this hungover.

23:49.528 --> 23:53.165
Make sure I have no eggs on mine,
just bacon, please.

23:59.070 --> 24:01.173
With Sophie and Chloe
not being there,

24:01.239 --> 24:03.742
the boys had a chance to
crack on with the girls,

24:03.809 --> 24:07.746
but they're both in my room.
I'm confused.

24:07.813 --> 24:12.417
When I got in the shag pad with her,
I thought, "Fuck this."

24:12.484 --> 24:15.020
Last night
I was able to get closer to Sarah,

24:15.086 --> 24:18.623
but still I don't know what I want.
It might be easier to be friends.

24:18.690 --> 24:19.691
Abbie, Aaron?

24:19.758 --> 24:23.128
Nah, she's... Ya know, she's
actually... she's all right, her.

24:30.535 --> 24:33.405
I don't know what come over
me and Marty last night.

24:33.471 --> 24:35.140
Dicks said yes, heads said no.

24:35.207 --> 24:37.375
I'm hungry for healthy food today.

24:37.442 --> 24:40.245
Who knows what Anna's got
in store for us next,

24:40.312 --> 24:43.882
but all I know is, I could actually
eat a salad. And that's a first!

24:43.949 --> 24:46.318
You couldn't eat healthy
if you tried.

24:56.695 --> 24:58.396
(laughter)

24:59.965 --> 25:00.966
Whoo!

25:01.032 --> 25:03.802
We're all chilling out,
feeling a bit hungover,

25:03.869 --> 25:07.505
when Marty decides to cupcake
the newbies with one of his farts.

25:07.572 --> 25:09.274
Girls, feel at home yet?

25:18.717 --> 25:20.385
Aaron, honestly, I love you.

25:27.325 --> 25:28.927
Hello!

25:28.994 --> 25:30.161
Oh, not her!
(all) Oh!

25:30.228 --> 25:32.197
Oh, my God, it's another girl.

25:32.264 --> 25:34.633
How many new workers
has Anna got coming?

25:35.567 --> 25:37.002
Whoo!
(laughter)

25:37.068 --> 25:40.705
I'm Eve, I'm 19. I've been single,
like, my whole life.

25:40.772 --> 25:43.341
Eve doesn't do relationships.

25:43.408 --> 25:46.177
Got nice boobs, haven't you?
Are they your boobs?

25:46.244 --> 25:49.481
They look like spaniel's ears.
(laughter)

25:49.547 --> 25:54.052
Anna has done it again.
She's sent in another girl.

25:54.119 --> 25:57.923
It's starting to look
like a big vagina fest.

25:57.989 --> 26:00.225
Do you know her? I know her.

26:00.292 --> 26:02.093
What the fuck is Anna playing at?

26:02.160 --> 26:05.497
First she puts in my ex bird
and now she's putting in a bird

26:05.563 --> 26:07.999
that sucked my fucking balls
on New Year's.

26:09.200 --> 26:11.703
I'm feeling so nervous,
me stomach's going.

26:11.770 --> 26:13.505
I always pump when I get nervous.

26:13.571 --> 26:15.907
I hope my tummy issues
don't let me down.

26:15.974 --> 26:18.476
Do you know anyone in the house?
I know Marty.

26:18.543 --> 26:19.978
How do you know him?

26:20.045 --> 26:22.847
We met at my house party on New Year
a few year ago.

26:22.914 --> 26:26.051
Did you? Oh, God. There's a
bit of past there with Marty!

26:26.117 --> 26:28.219
Did you have sex?
We didn't have sex.

26:28.286 --> 26:31.256
Did you give him a blowjob?
I didn't put it in my mouth.

26:31.323 --> 26:33.558
Shock.
Marty already knows the new girl.

26:33.625 --> 26:36.861
Apparently she had his balls
in her mouth on New Year's Eve.

26:36.928 --> 26:40.165
And she's called Eve.
What a coincidence.

26:40.231 --> 26:41.266
Are you single?

26:41.333 --> 26:43.735
Yes.
Oh, eh!

26:43.802 --> 26:48.173
Eve seems nice, but she is one more
to compete against for my dream job.

26:48.239 --> 26:50.442
Are you a good worker?
Yes.

26:50.508 --> 26:53.345
She's very pretty, very skinny.
She looks the part.

26:53.411 --> 26:55.013
Let's see what she's made of.

26:58.650 --> 27:01.453
Wanna play 21?
We cannot play with three people!

27:01.519 --> 27:02.520
Come on.

27:10.028 --> 27:11.529
Ooh, who's this?

27:11.596 --> 27:15.133
The door goes, and I hope Anna
has sent us another fit bird.

27:15.867 --> 27:18.069
How's it fucking going?!

27:18.136 --> 27:21.806
Aww, here, Anna's sent a lad in
with a bottle of jaeger in his hand.

27:21.873 --> 27:24.909
What is he, a fucking delivery guy?
What's happening?

27:24.976 --> 27:27.479
I'm Billy, I'm 20.
And what can I say?

27:27.545 --> 27:28.780
I'm a bit of a big deal.

27:28.847 --> 27:31.616
Once they go Billy,
they never want another willy.

27:31.683 --> 27:37.522
A new worker?! And he's a boy!
And he's fit! Cheers, Anna.

27:37.589 --> 27:39.124
Come on. Come on, Billy!

27:39.190 --> 27:42.227
Finally, Anna's sent a boy in.
That's what we need.

27:43.728 --> 27:48.166
I'm buzzing. Everyone in the house
is being sound. This will be wicked.

27:48.233 --> 27:50.869
Right, to Billy, cheers!
Welcome to the house.

27:50.935 --> 27:52.037
To fresh dick!

27:52.103 --> 27:54.639
Yay, finally got a lad!

27:54.706 --> 27:58.643
Billy walks in, bit of swag about
him, good looking lad, dresses well.

27:58.710 --> 28:00.378
But have you got what it takes?

28:00.445 --> 28:04.215
Anna has just sent loads,
obviously four, you're the fifth.

28:04.282 --> 28:07.085
So, we've got to make sure
you're good at work,

28:07.152 --> 28:11.156
can handle your drink, play games,
run shit. That's why yous are here.

28:15.527 --> 28:18.963
Who's farted?
Not me! That's my breath, I've said!

28:22.534 --> 28:24.269
Shit! The door's just went.

28:24.335 --> 28:27.705
I hope it's not another bird
that's sucked me fucking balls.

28:28.440 --> 28:31.309
Hi, everyone.
You all right, darling?!

28:31.376 --> 28:33.545
Oh, no. It's just boss Anna.

28:33.611 --> 28:36.681
Well, I've got a couple of jobs
tonight for you.

28:36.748 --> 28:39.117
First one is for the lads, Marty,
all right?

28:39.184 --> 28:43.922
It's a ladies night
on the party bus. (cheering)

28:43.988 --> 28:46.858
I need you to make sure
they have a really good time.

28:46.925 --> 28:48.460
I will, don't you worry.

28:48.526 --> 28:51.329
The boys have been told
we're working on a party bus.

28:51.396 --> 28:55.066
I'm going to take a back seat and
let the single lads do their thing.

28:55.133 --> 28:58.136
However, I will be keeping
a close eye on Billy.

28:58.203 --> 29:02.140
Lasses, I'm going to do something a
little bit new for yous, all right?

29:02.207 --> 29:06.177
It's a pop-up makeup station.
Sarah'll be good at that.

29:06.244 --> 29:07.412
Tanning...

29:07.479 --> 29:11.082
I can't wait to impress Anna.
This is gonna be my time to shine.

29:11.149 --> 29:13.218
I'm the best tanner
in the north east.

29:13.284 --> 29:15.487
I want the newbies to go
and get ready.

29:15.553 --> 29:18.123
Can you new workers go
and get yourselves ready?

29:18.189 --> 29:22.460
I might be being thrown in at the
deep end, but I am well up for this.

29:22.527 --> 29:25.763
I will do anything to be
a part of that Geordie crew.

29:25.830 --> 29:28.433
I will work my arse off to do it.

29:29.367 --> 29:31.402
Team, gather round.

29:31.469 --> 29:34.372
Now, I need to tell you something
really important.

29:35.073 --> 29:38.443
Oh, God. Let me guess.
You're a man?

29:38.510 --> 29:41.212
As you know, I've been
sending in new workers.

29:42.347 --> 29:44.782
Well, there's going to be more.

29:44.849 --> 29:46.451
How many more, Anna?

29:46.518 --> 29:49.621
As many as it takes, Sophie.
As many as it takes. All right?

29:49.687 --> 29:51.022
More workers?

29:51.089 --> 29:53.491
Anna, we're running out of
fucking beds.

29:53.558 --> 29:56.561
Well, I'm not going to be
taking them all on.

29:57.128 --> 29:59.497
Some of them just won't
make the cut.

29:59.564 --> 30:02.800
Well, I need your help.
I need to know whether they're good,

30:02.867 --> 30:05.703
I need to know whether
they're up for it, basically.

30:05.770 --> 30:08.039
Now, this is in your hands.

30:08.106 --> 30:09.841
This is massive news.

30:09.908 --> 30:12.677
Not only is there going to be
more newbies arriving,

30:12.744 --> 30:14.879
not all of them are going to
make the cut

30:14.946 --> 30:17.782
and we get to help Anna decide.
We have the power!

30:17.849 --> 30:19.417
OK? Get to work.

30:19.484 --> 30:23.288
Anna, you're looking lovely,
by the way. Don't let me down!

30:23.354 --> 30:27.425
What Anna's just said has just
totally changed the game completely.

30:27.492 --> 30:30.495
Everybody needs to take this
seriously cos if we fuck up,

30:30.562 --> 30:34.532
the last laugh's on us, cos we'll
end up living with someone shit.

30:34.599 --> 30:37.202
Imagine someone got in here
and we all hated them.

30:37.268 --> 30:39.837
At least we get to pick
who's going to live here.

30:39.904 --> 30:43.408
It's about being an all-rounder
and living in the house.

30:43.474 --> 30:46.211
Realistically, do you
honestly think that any of us

30:46.277 --> 30:49.614
are gonna pick someone
on the way they are at work? No.

30:49.681 --> 30:51.816
Anna wants us to pick
the best workers.

30:51.883 --> 30:54.586
Fuck that. We want the funnest
person to live with.

30:54.652 --> 30:58.223
I appreciate the meeting.
Gary, why did you do that?

30:58.289 --> 30:59.891
I'm trashing the house.

30:59.958 --> 31:02.627
Let's get the newbies who are here
ready for work,

31:02.694 --> 31:06.164
then we can start figuring out
who would be best to fit our family.

31:06.231 --> 31:07.365
Let's get ready.

31:08.600 --> 31:09.767
Well, have fun.

31:09.834 --> 31:11.936
Ugh!

31:12.003 --> 31:14.005
Love yous.
You're being weird, you.

31:25.850 --> 31:27.619
Howay, let's fucking go!

31:27.685 --> 31:29.787
We all look mint
and we're good to go,

31:29.854 --> 31:32.290
so let's put this new worker Billy
to the test.

31:32.357 --> 31:33.424
Oi to the fuckin oi.

31:33.491 --> 31:36.527
Me first day in the house
and tonight I've got to work.

31:36.594 --> 31:39.764
It involves drinking and birds.
I normally do this for fun.

31:39.831 --> 31:42.100
Listen, Billy,
it's good to have you here.

31:42.166 --> 31:45.670
We're gonna get fucking smashed.
Cheers, lads.

31:52.010 --> 31:53.544
(claps)

31:53.611 --> 31:55.747
Now that Anna has
given us the power,

31:55.813 --> 31:58.049
I'm gonna have some fun with it.

31:58.116 --> 32:00.385
I feel regal when I do that.
(claps)

32:00.451 --> 32:03.655
Nathan, he's starting to think
he's King Henry.

32:03.721 --> 32:06.491
Watch out new workers,
heads may roll.

32:06.557 --> 32:08.426
Ready to roll?

32:08.493 --> 32:12.897
Peasants, listen up! Nathan has
taken this power trip way too far.

32:12.964 --> 32:15.833
You don't look regal, mate,
you look like a twat.

32:16.668 --> 32:20.004
Where's your work tops?
I've got them. Put them on.

32:20.071 --> 32:22.573
Kudos to you, Eve,
for having your T-shirt on.

32:22.640 --> 32:25.977
Well, now that we're all eventually
ready, let's go to work.

32:26.044 --> 32:28.146
Let's go, girls. Well done, come on.

32:28.212 --> 32:30.014
Geordie Tours!

32:30.081 --> 32:31.215
Geordie Tours!

32:36.321 --> 32:37.388
Buzzing!

32:38.456 --> 32:39.624
She said "lap dance".

32:41.225 --> 32:43.728
Time to see if they've got
what it takes.

32:43.795 --> 32:47.165
Tonight, I'm gonna chance my luck.
What the fuck are you doing?

32:47.231 --> 32:49.734
That kid does not know
what day it is.

32:49.801 --> 32:52.170
We only want the best of the best.

32:52.236 --> 32:54.405
Your fate is in our hands.

32:55.973 --> 32:57.975
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

33:00.945 --> 33:01.145
.

33:03.681 --> 33:03.881
.

33:18.563 --> 33:21.199
(laughter)

33:21.265 --> 33:24.469
Tonight, Anna's got me, Marty,
Aaron and new worker Billy

33:24.535 --> 33:27.038
doing a ladies night on a party bus.

33:27.839 --> 33:28.840
Hi, girls.

33:28.906 --> 33:32.543
We've got to show these girls
a good time. That means shots, games

33:32.610 --> 33:35.747
and loads of flirting.
Let's see what Billy is all about.

33:35.813 --> 33:38.616
Billy! Billy!
Billy, explain this, right?

33:38.683 --> 33:41.419
Pass this round.
Unravel it, shot, truth or dare.

33:41.486 --> 33:43.588
This is my opportunity
to show the lads

33:43.654 --> 33:45.957
I'm the perfect person
to join their crew.

33:46.023 --> 33:49.927
Unravel this. Every time you
unravel, it's a shot. Let's go!

33:49.994 --> 33:54.298
Billy, I've just explained the game
to you and you still got it wrong.

33:54.365 --> 33:56.467
There's a truth or dare
in there, mate.

33:56.534 --> 33:58.770
Pass this back,
pass this back quickly.

33:58.836 --> 34:01.406
Every time you unravel,
it's a truth or dare.

34:01.472 --> 34:03.741
Pass the parcel,
but a shot, truth or dare.

34:03.808 --> 34:06.844
Oh, shit. Maybe I need
a drink to calm me nerves.

34:06.911 --> 34:08.746
Pass it on to the next one.

34:15.887 --> 34:20.558
Ten seconds.
Ten, nine, eight...

34:20.625 --> 34:22.760
Aaron, she said "lap dance".

34:22.827 --> 34:24.962
(laughter)

34:25.029 --> 34:26.364
This game is radge.

34:26.431 --> 34:29.467
If this is what they call work,
I never want to retire.

34:29.534 --> 34:31.668
Let's go!

34:37.175 --> 34:40.844
We arrive at Anna's new pop-up
makeup station, and it's our job

34:40.911 --> 34:43.815
to make the clients
look on Geordie fleek.

34:43.880 --> 34:48.820
Abbie, Sarah, Zahida and Eve, time
to see what you girls are made of.

34:48.886 --> 34:50.922
I'm gonna put you
on the makeup one...

34:50.987 --> 34:54.559
This is wicked, Sophie has got
all these newbies grafting,

34:54.625 --> 34:57.528
so me, her and Marnie can
sit back and do fuck all.

34:57.595 --> 35:00.998
Abs, you've got the best tan
in Newcastle,

35:01.065 --> 35:04.268
so I'm gonna put you
on the spray tan.

35:04.335 --> 35:06.103
I'm all over this. Bring it on.

35:06.170 --> 35:09.707
Eve, get the girls in,
and let's get them Geordified up.

35:09.774 --> 35:11.642
Come on, girl, go on! You can do it!

35:11.709 --> 35:14.946
Spray tans, spray tans!
Come and get your spray tans!

35:15.012 --> 35:17.648
Spray tans! Who wants to
get a Geordie makeover?

35:17.715 --> 35:19.383
Girls?!

35:21.452 --> 35:25.256
The game we always play is the
ice cube game. Start with you.

35:25.323 --> 35:27.425
We're all having a wicked night,

35:27.492 --> 35:31.429
but because I've got a girlfriend and
the next game is pass the ice cube,

35:31.496 --> 35:35.366
I'm gonna leave this one.
To a girl, to a boy.

35:38.369 --> 35:40.238
Eh, howay, pass that ice cube.

35:41.572 --> 35:44.242
It sucks to be you, Marty.
Too bad, kid.

35:44.308 --> 35:48.045
Even Billy the new boy
is getting more action than you.

35:48.112 --> 35:49.614
I cannot believe me luck.

35:49.680 --> 35:52.583
I'm having the best night
and I don't want it to stop.

35:52.650 --> 35:54.285
Go on, son! That's my boy.

35:54.352 --> 35:58.055
Billy got off to a shaky start
tonight, but he recovered well.

35:58.122 --> 36:00.057
Time to ditch the clients

36:00.124 --> 36:03.461
and see if he can keep up the pace
because we're off to the club.

36:03.528 --> 36:06.597
Let's have a good night.
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

36:10.535 --> 36:14.038
We get to House of Smith and it's
bouncing, let's fucking have it.

36:18.009 --> 36:20.945
Cheers!
Boys, first night at work smashed.

36:21.012 --> 36:24.749
Billy's first night,
he's having a good night. Oi, oi!

36:33.491 --> 36:35.226
It's really good, isn't it?

36:35.293 --> 36:37.628
It's really busy
at the makeup station.

36:37.695 --> 36:40.264
Eve's doing so good
at bringing in the punters.

36:40.331 --> 36:44.769
And the newbies are doing so well at
making these Geordies Geordified.

36:46.037 --> 36:50.308
Will you just make sure
you tell Sophie, Nathan and Marnie

36:50.374 --> 36:51.809
that I did a good job?

36:51.876 --> 36:53.544
I don't want to be too cocky,

36:53.611 --> 36:55.947
but I'm absolutely
fucking smashing it.

36:56.013 --> 36:59.817
All of Zahida's clients are leaving
with a smile on their face.

36:59.884 --> 37:03.621
I haven't got a clue what's going on
in the tanning tent with Abbie.

37:03.688 --> 37:05.923
She's been dipped in soy sauce!

37:05.990 --> 37:07.692
(laughter)

37:07.758 --> 37:11.495
Nobody spray tans like that.
Looks like she's painting a fence.

37:11.562 --> 37:13.264
Are you happy?
No, I'm fuming.

37:13.331 --> 37:14.799
Why?
Look at the state on it.

37:14.865 --> 37:17.902
Fair enough,
this girl looks a state.

37:17.969 --> 37:20.538
But I've never even used
a spray tan gun before.

37:20.605 --> 37:22.907
(all laugh)

37:22.974 --> 37:25.610
At least the others
can see the funny side.

37:25.676 --> 37:27.078
See you later, no bother.

37:27.144 --> 37:29.380
With most of the clients
leaving happy,

37:29.447 --> 37:32.250
now the real work
begins for the newbies.

37:33.150 --> 37:37.254
It's time to see if they've got what
it takes to party with us Geordies,

37:37.321 --> 37:40.591
so we're going to meet up
with the lads and find out.

37:42.727 --> 37:44.962
I think I've done wicked
at work tonight,

37:45.029 --> 37:48.165
but I'm buzzing my shift's over,
cos now I can get drunk!

37:57.808 --> 38:00.177
We get to the club
and we meet up with the lads.

38:00.244 --> 38:03.014
Tonight is going to be
fucking belter!

38:05.249 --> 38:09.487
We're all having a really good
party, but I'm really missing Chloe.

38:10.988 --> 38:13.124
I'm not gonna lie,
I'm pretty shitfaced

38:13.190 --> 38:17.495
and my confidence is sky high,
so tonight I'm gonna chance my luck.

38:18.763 --> 38:20.464
Billy tries to neck on with us.

38:20.531 --> 38:24.068
Howay, man, it's only your first
night. A bit keen, aren't ya?

38:24.135 --> 38:27.438
Billy is absolutely smashed,
trying to neck on with everyone.

38:27.505 --> 38:30.641
Welcome to the house, mate,
you'll probably fit in.

38:39.450 --> 38:41.519
Billy, are you fucking radge?

38:41.585 --> 38:44.622
You've necked on with Abbie,
now you're trying with me?

38:44.689 --> 38:47.291
I've got a boyfriend,
what the fuck are you doing?

38:50.561 --> 38:53.798
What the fuck has happened to Billy?
What have the lads done?

38:53.864 --> 38:58.169
I know Anna said, "Put them through
their paces," but howay, lads!

39:01.172 --> 39:03.607
It's my first time
out with the Geordie squad.

39:03.674 --> 39:05.676
I'm having the best night ever.

39:05.743 --> 39:08.079
I'd love to be a part of
this family.

39:12.783 --> 39:17.021
Tonight is going off,
but it's time for us to regroup

39:17.088 --> 39:19.356
and talk about
how the newbies did today.

39:27.732 --> 39:30.968
Abbie might have had a mare
and tried to blag the spray tan,

39:31.035 --> 39:33.871
but that's what us Geordies do,
we're blaggers.

39:37.208 --> 39:41.278
From what I see, it looks like Billy
was born be a Geordie lad.

39:41.345 --> 39:44.682
Aaron, Gary and Marty are
taking him right under their wing.

39:45.883 --> 39:49.587
The new workers are good fun to be
around and, if I was in their shoes,

39:49.653 --> 39:52.790
I'd wanna know what Anna said,
so I might just tell them.

40:00.197 --> 40:02.199
I've not been this wasted
in a while.

40:02.266 --> 40:04.602
One thing I've learnt today
is to not give up

40:04.668 --> 40:06.804
and Eve's body's looking
mighty fine.

40:10.307 --> 40:14.245
Uh-uh-uh, Billy, I have seen
all the girls pieing you tonight,

40:14.311 --> 40:17.948
so here's another one, and go
and open yourself a bakery.

40:22.520 --> 40:24.722
Everyone is fucked,
especially Billy.

40:24.789 --> 40:27.491
That kid does not know
what day it is.

40:27.558 --> 40:30.795
He needs his fucking bed.
Let's go, go, go, go!

40:39.904 --> 40:43.574
We're in the taxi, and I've not felt
this hammered in quite a while.

40:44.642 --> 40:47.711
If we don't pull over soon,
I'm going to decorate this cab.

40:49.747 --> 40:51.482
Billy, when you're out with us,

40:51.549 --> 40:56.120
you've got to remember, it's
a marathon, not a fucking sprint.

40:58.789 --> 41:02.293
First night in the house, I think
I've smashed it a bit too much.

41:02.359 --> 41:06.430
I've already puked. Get me to bed,
I think I'm best off on my own.

41:16.640 --> 41:20.811
Right, now that we're all back,
can we just have a little word?

41:20.878 --> 41:22.279
Let's have a little word.

41:22.346 --> 41:27.017
Quiet, quiet round the table,
King Nathan is about to speak.

41:27.084 --> 41:29.486
We need to let you in
on a little secret.

41:29.553 --> 41:32.890
Fuck it, I'm going to tell the
newbies that none of them are safe

41:32.957 --> 41:35.826
and they need to raise their game
if they want to stay,

41:35.893 --> 41:38.529
cos we only want
the best of the best.

41:38.596 --> 41:43.334
We're helping Anna decide
who stays and who goes.

41:43.400 --> 41:47.304
At the end of the day,
it's like a massive job trial.

41:47.371 --> 41:49.206
You've got a few weeks to impress.

41:49.273 --> 41:51.308
What the newbies don't understand is

41:51.375 --> 41:53.811
we don't give a shit
how good they are at work,

41:53.878 --> 41:56.680
we just want to know how fun
they would be to live with,

41:56.747 --> 41:59.216
and are they crazy enough?

41:59.283 --> 42:04.221
The moral of the story is,
your fate is in our hands.

42:04.288 --> 42:08.292
So, yous have got to step it up
at work, step it up in the house,

42:08.359 --> 42:10.227
prove that you wanna be here.

42:10.294 --> 42:13.297
What the actual fuck?
I could get hoyed out of here,

42:13.364 --> 42:15.165
and I really don't want that.

42:15.232 --> 42:17.368
Let's end the conversation there,

42:17.434 --> 42:22.373
this food's fucking rank,
I feel fat again. Let's go to bed.

42:22.439 --> 42:26.076
I've got a feeling the newbies will
have a restless night's sleep,

42:26.143 --> 42:27.611
but I won't, I'm off to bed.

42:30.714 --> 42:33.217
Tonight, Nathan has dropped
the bombshell.

42:33.284 --> 42:36.186
Tomorrow is going to be
a very interesting day.

42:38.088 --> 42:41.992
I can't believe some of us could be
going home. I just hope it's not me.

42:48.732 --> 42:49.800
Hiya!
It's Chloe!

42:49.867 --> 42:52.970
(screams)
Now we all know what her cum face is!

42:53.671 --> 42:55.105
Who the fuck is she?

42:56.607 --> 42:59.810
I think I love her.
I know exactly who I'm going to zap.

42:59.877 --> 43:01.278
(groans)

43:01.345 --> 43:05.215
Everyone's sick of your shit, Martin!
That boy is not good for me.

43:05.282 --> 43:07.651
It's actually giving us
a little twinge.

43:08.319 --> 43:11.722
I can't stand Martin.
I'm so fucking angry.

43:38.449 --> 43:38.649
.
