WEBVTT

00:01.740 --> 00:03.740
NARRATOR:
Sacred tattoos.

00:03.760 --> 00:07.170
These are primeval symbols
that speak to something in us

00:07.190 --> 00:09.860
that's very deep-seated
and very universal.

00:09.990 --> 00:12.820
NARRATOR:
Severe body modifications.

00:12.950 --> 00:13.870
BILL BIRNES:
The tribespeople

00:13.990 --> 00:15.870
sharpen the edges of their teeth

00:15.990 --> 00:17.910
to look like serpents.

00:18.040 --> 00:20.210
NARRATOR:
Extreme adornments.

00:20.330 --> 00:22.250
JONATHAN YOUNG: Girls in the Kayan
culture stretched out their necks

00:22.370 --> 00:26.340
with brass rings to emulate
their sacred ancestor.

00:26.460 --> 00:30.090
NARRATOR: Could these metamorphic
alterations of the flesh

00:30.220 --> 00:32.930
represent more
than mere self-expression

00:33.050 --> 00:35.970
or even acts
of religious tribute?

00:36.100 --> 00:38.890
Might they contain a message

00:39.020 --> 00:41.430
critical to the future
of mankind?

00:41.560 --> 00:45.060
GIORGIO A. TSOUKALOS: The reason
why they did this to their bodies

00:45.190 --> 00:49.030
is in order to gain
the strength of the gods

00:49.150 --> 00:50.940
that they tried to imitate.

00:51.070 --> 00:52.860
WILLIAM HENRY:
We now have technology

00:52.990 --> 00:55.160
that is equal to what we see

00:55.280 --> 00:57.410
the gods using
in these ancient stories.

00:57.530 --> 01:01.160
Maybe now we're gonna be able
to turn ourselves into a species

01:01.290 --> 01:03.000
just like the gods.

01:05.330 --> 01:07.960
NARRATOR:
There is a doorway

01:08.090 --> 01:10.210
in the universe.

01:10.340 --> 01:13.130
Beyond it is
the promise of truth.

01:15.140 --> 01:17.100
It demands
we question everything

01:17.220 --> 01:19.930
we have ever been taught.

01:20.060 --> 01:23.270
The evidence is all around us.

01:23.390 --> 01:27.020
The future is
right before our eyes.

01:27.150 --> 01:29.940
We are not alone.

01:30.070 --> 01:33.110
We have never been alone.

01:44.460 --> 01:48.040
Tattooed and pierced
Italian fashion model

01:48.170 --> 01:51.340
Cristian Mignemi makes a bold
and permanent decision

01:51.460 --> 01:54.920
to transform the sclera,
or whites of his eyes,

01:55.050 --> 01:57.090
into black.

01:57.220 --> 02:02.100
He claims he wants to appear
more otherworldly.

02:02.220 --> 02:04.180
Cristian Mignemi

02:04.310 --> 02:06.940
is a very forward-thinking
person in fashion,

02:07.060 --> 02:08.310
by choosing to go to the extreme

02:08.440 --> 02:10.940
of coloring his eyes
completely black,

02:11.070 --> 02:12.320
looking almost alien-like.

02:12.440 --> 02:15.110
This is a trend happening
across the board.

02:15.240 --> 02:17.070
Body modifications,

02:17.200 --> 02:19.160
tattooing, piercing,

02:19.280 --> 02:21.240
all types of adornments
to change

02:21.370 --> 02:23.410
the physical appearance
of our bodies.

02:23.540 --> 02:26.370
It's almost as if humanity,
in a fashion sense,

02:26.500 --> 02:29.250
is gearing themselves
to look more alien.

02:29.380 --> 02:31.340
MITCH HOROWITZ:
People feel liberated

02:31.460 --> 02:34.010
by the idea that they can appear

02:34.130 --> 02:36.090
extrahuman in some way.

02:36.220 --> 02:38.180
They can look
like something extraterrestrial

02:38.300 --> 02:41.050
or they can look
like something primeval.

02:41.180 --> 02:43.010
There's something
self-dramatizing

02:43.140 --> 02:45.890
and empowering about it.

02:46.020 --> 02:47.230
(buzzing)

02:47.350 --> 02:49.400
NARRATOR:
Today, tattoos and piercings

02:49.520 --> 02:52.940
account for a nearly
$1 billion industry.

02:54.150 --> 02:56.240
Trending modification practices

02:56.360 --> 02:59.030
like ear elongation
and branding the skin

02:59.160 --> 03:01.240
are all on the rise.

03:01.370 --> 03:04.080
But what could motivate someone
to alter their body

03:04.200 --> 03:06.200
in such a way?

03:06.330 --> 03:08.290
The way we adorn our bodies

03:08.420 --> 03:12.040
is essentially telling a story
and sending messages.

03:12.170 --> 03:14.130
The fact that
more and more people

03:14.250 --> 03:16.420
are expressing themselves
through body art,

03:16.550 --> 03:20.140
it tells a bigger story
on a cultural level.

03:20.260 --> 03:22.260
Now that we're so connected
through the Internet,

03:22.390 --> 03:24.310
it's easy to find inspiration
from others

03:24.430 --> 03:27.270
and what other people are doing
in body art practices.

03:27.390 --> 03:29.100
Symbols communicate things

03:29.230 --> 03:31.350
that we're not quite able
to put into words.

03:31.480 --> 03:34.150
It goes beyond just wanting
to make a statement

03:34.270 --> 03:36.150
about one's individuality.

03:36.280 --> 03:40.280
It demonstrates
what you believe in.

03:41.570 --> 03:43.240
NARRATOR:
While tattoos, piercings

03:43.370 --> 03:45.290
and body modification

03:45.410 --> 03:48.200
are modern forms
of personal expression,

03:48.330 --> 03:52.040
they also hearken back
to humanity's ancient past

03:52.170 --> 03:54.130
and mirror the practices

03:54.250 --> 03:56.250
of many so-called
primitive tribes that exist

03:56.380 --> 03:59.340
around the world today.

03:59.470 --> 04:02.300
A lot of what we do
finds inspiration

04:02.430 --> 04:05.100
in ancient roots
from all over the world.

04:05.220 --> 04:07.220
These are things
that we've seen on, say,

04:07.350 --> 04:08.430
like, <i>National Geographic</i>

04:08.560 --> 04:10.390
and books and on TV
over the years.

04:10.520 --> 04:12.310
And they've inspired newer forms

04:12.440 --> 04:16.070
of body modification
and body art expression.

04:16.190 --> 04:17.399
NARRATOR:
Rites of passage,

04:17.529 --> 04:19.190
like skin stretching,

04:19.320 --> 04:20.399
have been seen
throughout history

04:20.529 --> 04:23.240
in different parts of the world.

04:23.360 --> 04:25.280
The revered Buddha,

04:25.410 --> 04:27.290
the Dayak of Borneo,

04:27.410 --> 04:30.160
the ancient Rapa Nui
of Easter Island

04:30.290 --> 04:33.370
and the modern Fulani tribe
of West Africa

04:33.500 --> 04:37.380
all have colorful histories
of ritual ear stretching.

04:37.500 --> 04:41.090
The contemporary Mursi women
of Ethiopia,

04:41.220 --> 04:43.260
tribes of the Amazon

04:43.380 --> 04:46.220
and the earlier Botocudo people
of coastal Brazil

04:46.350 --> 04:48.260
all share a history
of skin stretching

04:48.390 --> 04:50.640
for decorative lip plates.

04:50.770 --> 04:54.440
But are these practices being
adopted by mainstream society

04:54.560 --> 04:57.360
simply as a fashion trend,

04:57.480 --> 05:01.190
a bold form of self-expression?

05:01.320 --> 05:03.320
Or could it be motivated
by a profound link

05:03.450 --> 05:05.320
to our ancient past?

05:05.450 --> 05:07.280
TSOUKALOS:
When people have tattoos,

05:07.410 --> 05:09.290
it's something meaningful.

05:09.410 --> 05:12.290
And so my question is not,
today,

05:12.410 --> 05:14.290
why do we tattoo ourselves?

05:14.420 --> 05:16.380
I ask the question,

05:16.500 --> 05:20.260
when did we first tattoo
ourselves, and then why?

05:20.380 --> 05:22.340
(wind blowing)

05:22.470 --> 05:26.220
NARRATOR:
September 9, 1991.

05:26.340 --> 05:30.560
11,000 feet high
in the Otztal Alps.

05:30.680 --> 05:34.480
Two German climbers
near the Austrian-Italian border

05:34.600 --> 05:37.480
happen upon a frozen corpse.

05:37.610 --> 05:42.320
Scientists call him
the Tyrolean Iceman, or Otzi,

05:42.440 --> 05:44.320
and place his time of death

05:44.450 --> 05:48.530
between 3400 and 3100 BC.

05:48.660 --> 05:51.160
What we find so amazing
about Otzi,

05:51.290 --> 05:53.120
he's very well preserved.

05:53.250 --> 05:54.660
So well preserved

05:54.790 --> 05:56.580
that scientists and
anthropologists can even tell

05:56.710 --> 05:59.500
that he had
a lot of medical conditions.

05:59.630 --> 06:02.130
And that leads us
to Otzi's tattoos.

06:02.260 --> 06:04.340
NARRATOR:
In 2015,

06:04.470 --> 06:07.470
more than two decades
after the initial discovery,

06:07.590 --> 06:10.310
scientists were able
to make a more detailed scan

06:10.430 --> 06:12.430
of the Iceman's epidermis.

06:12.560 --> 06:16.230
The results were extraordinary.

06:16.350 --> 06:18.230
ANDREW COLLINS:
Under examination,

06:18.350 --> 06:22.360
it was found
that Otzi the Iceman

06:22.480 --> 06:27.450
had, in fact, 61 different
tattoos over his body,

06:27.570 --> 06:31.280
and almost all of these
took the form of parallel lines,

06:31.410 --> 06:33.540
either two together,
three together.

06:33.660 --> 06:36.460
In one case, seven together.

06:36.580 --> 06:38.540
BARRETTA:
These tattoos, it's amazing.

06:38.670 --> 06:42.340
They are actually located
on acupuncture points

06:42.460 --> 06:43.710
throughout the body.

06:43.840 --> 06:46.300
Most of them are on the joints,
the lower back,

06:46.420 --> 06:49.390
the thoracic area, the chest.

06:49.510 --> 06:53.260
And what that tells us is he had
some knowledge of healing.

06:55.600 --> 06:59.480
NARRATOR: Acupuncture is a
traditional form of Chinese medicine

06:59.600 --> 07:01.480
involving the pricking
of the skin with needles

07:01.610 --> 07:04.400
along the body's
neurohormonal meridians

07:04.530 --> 07:08.740
to alleviate pain and treat
various medical conditions.

07:08.860 --> 07:13.240
Traditional historians place the
origin of acupuncture in China

07:13.370 --> 07:16.330
at approximately 100 BC.

07:16.450 --> 07:19.370
Acupuncture did not exist
as a formal system

07:19.500 --> 07:22.420
of therapeutic treatment
in China, uh,

07:22.540 --> 07:25.630
at the time
that Otzi received his tattoos

07:25.760 --> 07:28.340
on the other side of the globe.

07:28.470 --> 07:31.390
HENRY: So, where did Otzi
get these tattoos

07:31.510 --> 07:32.600
that were made
with the knowledge

07:32.720 --> 07:35.430
of acupuncture points
on the body?

07:35.560 --> 07:38.560
DAVID CHILDRESS: We think
acupuncture's from China,

07:38.690 --> 07:41.600
but here's something even older
and from the Alps.

07:41.730 --> 07:44.520
CAROLINE CORY: The fact
that we find these tattoos

07:44.650 --> 07:47.490
at specific meridian points
tells us

07:47.610 --> 07:50.530
that this civilization knew

07:50.660 --> 07:52.700
of the meridians in the body,

07:52.820 --> 07:55.740
understood how energy runs
in the body,

07:55.870 --> 07:59.580
which is quite an advanced
process for that time.

07:59.710 --> 08:01.460
So, where did this knowledge
come from?

08:01.580 --> 08:03.540
Is it possible that it came

08:03.670 --> 08:06.590
from some kind of higher source,

08:06.710 --> 08:11.340
downloaded
into the healers of the time?

08:11.470 --> 08:13.550
Is it possible that acupuncture

08:13.680 --> 08:16.260
is really coming
from extraterrestrials?

08:17.600 --> 08:19.640
NARRATOR:
Could the Tyrolean Iceman

08:19.770 --> 08:23.440
point to the possibility
that tattooing originated

08:23.560 --> 08:26.690
as a result of contact
with extraterrestrial visitors?

08:26.820 --> 08:29.740
While it may sound far-fetched,

08:29.860 --> 08:32.490
ancient astronaut theorists
suggest

08:32.610 --> 08:34.570
that some of
the most popular tattoos

08:34.700 --> 08:36.740
found in both the ancient
and modern world

08:36.870 --> 08:40.370
contain symbolism
connected to the cosmos.

08:41.750 --> 08:44.330
HOROWITZ:
Some of the earliest yearnings

08:44.460 --> 08:46.540
of our ancient ancestors

08:46.670 --> 08:49.460
was to recognize
and connect themselves

08:49.590 --> 08:52.550
to the cosmos, to the movement
of celestial objects,

08:52.680 --> 08:55.340
to the cycles of the seasons.

08:55.470 --> 08:56.760
In modern tattoo art,

08:56.890 --> 08:59.640
we're not only seeing
a proliferation

08:59.770 --> 09:01.640
of celestial images,

09:01.770 --> 09:04.480
whether the Sun, the stars,

09:04.600 --> 09:07.570
the phases of the Moon,
astrological symbols,

09:07.690 --> 09:11.690
but we're also starting to see
E.T. images.

09:11.820 --> 09:15.780
These are primeval symbols
that speak to something in us

09:15.910 --> 09:18.700
that's very deep-seated
and very universal.

09:18.830 --> 09:22.750
Tattooing or body modification
can be a way

09:22.870 --> 09:26.460
of remembering one's ancestors,

09:26.580 --> 09:29.840
remembering one's connection
with the cosmos.

09:29.960 --> 09:32.670
NARRATOR: A yearning to
connect with the cosmos

09:32.800 --> 09:36.590
is perhaps as old
as civilization itself.

09:36.720 --> 09:38.760
And ancient astronaut theorists
suggest

09:38.890 --> 09:42.430
that tattoos represent
far more than merely

09:42.560 --> 09:45.480
a symbolic representation
of this.

09:45.600 --> 09:48.560
They believe that the desire
to alter the flesh

09:48.690 --> 09:50.610
through tattooing
and other means

09:50.730 --> 09:54.820
may be embedded deep
in the subconscious mind

09:54.950 --> 09:57.740
and that perhaps the origin
of this human need

09:57.870 --> 10:01.620
can be found encoded
in the well-preserved skin

10:01.740 --> 10:05.500
of Egypt's mummies.

10:09.590 --> 10:12.340
NARRATOR:
Deir el-Medina, Egypt.

10:12.460 --> 10:15.470
2014.

10:15.590 --> 10:17.890
Using modern imaging equipment,

10:18.010 --> 10:21.640
Dr. Anne Austin scans
the body of a female mummy

10:21.760 --> 10:25.520
dating back as far as 1300 BC.

10:25.640 --> 10:28.650
What she finds is unexpected

10:28.770 --> 10:30.860
and contradicts
long-held beliefs

10:30.980 --> 10:34.860
regarding female roles
in ancient Egyptian society.

10:34.990 --> 10:37.910
One particular torso
was a human female

10:38.030 --> 10:42.700
who had the image of Hathor
tattooed onto her body.

10:42.830 --> 10:44.700
In ancient Egypt,

10:44.830 --> 10:46.870
having the tattoo of Hathor
on your body

10:47.000 --> 10:48.880
would clearly be an indication

10:49.000 --> 10:52.630
of your status
as a priestess of Hathor

10:52.750 --> 10:55.670
and as a person who's not just
a representative of Hathor

10:55.800 --> 10:58.720
but maybe in direct contact
with the goddess, as well.

10:58.840 --> 11:01.760
BARRETTA:
Prior to finding these mummies,

11:01.890 --> 11:03.850
it was believed
that women in Egypt

11:03.970 --> 11:07.560
were only tattooed if they were
prostitutes or dancers.

11:07.690 --> 11:08.980
We see that, no,

11:09.100 --> 11:12.520
these were most likely,
you know, priestesses.

11:12.650 --> 11:16.610
The tattoos relate to a deity,

11:16.740 --> 11:19.700
to a sky god, Hathor.

11:19.820 --> 11:22.830
The symbol for Hathor
would sometimes be

11:22.950 --> 11:27.620
the head of a cow, horns,
a disc in the center.

11:27.750 --> 11:29.960
The Egyptian tattoos
are very symbolic

11:30.080 --> 11:33.750
of their close association
with the cosmos.

11:33.880 --> 11:36.710
They were very in tune
with their gods.

11:36.840 --> 11:37.920
They felt,
through these symbols,

11:38.050 --> 11:39.510
they were communicating
with the gods.

11:40.930 --> 11:42.550
NARRATOR:
The Egyptian goddess Hathor

11:42.680 --> 11:44.850
is an earlier incarnation
of Isis,

11:44.970 --> 11:46.890
considered the primeval goddess

11:47.020 --> 11:49.480
from whom all others
were derived.

11:50.900 --> 11:52.980
In the Temple of Hathor
in Dendera,

11:53.110 --> 11:56.820
the goddess is depicted sailing
in a ship of eternity

11:56.940 --> 11:58.780
along the night waters...

11:58.900 --> 12:01.820
Not of the Nile
but of the Milky Way.

12:01.950 --> 12:04.700
TSOUKALOS: Dendera is
one of the most important

12:04.830 --> 12:06.660
ancient Egyptian sites.

12:06.790 --> 12:10.710
It clearly depicts travel
through the sky

12:10.830 --> 12:13.000
with the so-called sun barges.

12:13.130 --> 12:18.590
And our ancestors knew
that ships do not fly

12:18.710 --> 12:20.880
across the sky
or across the Sun.

12:21.010 --> 12:24.600
So why would they
describe barges

12:24.720 --> 12:26.680
that came down from the sky?

12:26.810 --> 12:30.770
What is depicted in Dendera
are the extraterrestrials

12:30.890 --> 12:33.650
as they're traveling
across the sky.

12:35.730 --> 12:37.150
NARRATOR:
Is it possible

12:37.280 --> 12:39.900
that the mummy found
at Deir el-Medina was tattooed

12:40.030 --> 12:42.700
with symbols representing
extraterrestrial visitors

12:42.820 --> 12:43.860
to Earth?

12:46.030 --> 12:48.040
TSOUKALOS:
My idea is

12:48.160 --> 12:52.000
that the ancient Egyptians
worshipped those symbols

12:52.120 --> 12:55.710
because not only
did they have to illustrate

12:55.840 --> 12:57.800
that they were
of the ruling class

12:57.920 --> 13:00.920
but also that they had
a direct connection,

13:01.050 --> 13:02.720
or so they thought,

13:02.840 --> 13:04.840
to Hathor.

13:04.970 --> 13:07.890
The reason why they put that
on their bodies

13:08.010 --> 13:10.100
is in order to gain

13:10.220 --> 13:14.650
the strength of the gods
that they tried to imitate.

13:14.770 --> 13:16.690
And these gods were

13:16.810 --> 13:19.690
flesh-and-blood
extraterrestrials.

13:21.030 --> 13:22.900
NARRATOR:
Do the tattoos

13:23.030 --> 13:25.070
found on the mummies
at Deir el-Medina

13:25.200 --> 13:28.660
reveal attempts to connect
with the power of a god

13:28.780 --> 13:31.120
or an extraterrestrial being?

13:31.250 --> 13:35.710
And did the ancient Egyptians
permanently mark their flesh

13:35.830 --> 13:37.880
in order to honor divine beings

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
or leave a lasting commemoration

13:40.130 --> 13:43.010
of contact
with otherworldly visitors?

13:43.130 --> 13:45.840
HOROWITZ:
Humanity has always used

13:45.970 --> 13:49.760
symbols and sigils
and cryptography

13:49.890 --> 13:52.600
to convey messages.

13:53.980 --> 13:55.060
BARRETTA:
The Egyptians realized

13:55.190 --> 13:58.020
there was a lot of power
in symbols,

13:58.150 --> 14:00.980
and they knew
how to use these symbols

14:01.110 --> 14:04.030
when they would tattoo.

14:04.150 --> 14:06.860
We have to wonder,
was it to communicate

14:06.990 --> 14:08.780
with the gods
through their tattoos?

14:08.910 --> 14:09.950
To emulate the gods?

14:10.080 --> 14:12.910
To embody the gods?

14:14.960 --> 14:17.790
NARRATOR: The cow and
disc representing Hathor

14:17.920 --> 14:20.000
was not the only tattoo
discovered on the mummies

14:20.130 --> 14:22.090
at Deir el-Medina.

14:22.210 --> 14:25.800
One of the bodies also bore
another powerful symbol.

14:27.180 --> 14:29.930
BARRETTA:
She had the Eye of Horus.

14:30.050 --> 14:33.720
And they say the Eye of Horus
is composed of six parts

14:33.850 --> 14:36.100
which relate to our six senses.

14:36.230 --> 14:38.810
Not the five we think we have.
We have six.

14:38.940 --> 14:41.860
Sight, hearing, smell,

14:41.980 --> 14:44.820
taste, touch and thought.

14:44.940 --> 14:47.150
But what is thought?
Is that extrasensory thought?

14:47.280 --> 14:50.990
Is that the way
we communicate nonverbally?

14:52.160 --> 14:54.040
So, the Eye of Horus

14:54.160 --> 14:58.790
also has a very magical type
of element to it.

15:01.090 --> 15:04.090
HOROWITZ: The all-seeing
eye or the Eye of Horus

15:04.210 --> 15:06.970
as it was depicted
in ancient Egypt

15:07.090 --> 15:09.890
was one of the holiest
of symbols.

15:10.010 --> 15:11.970
It served
to remind the individual

15:12.100 --> 15:14.810
that human life is incomplete

15:14.930 --> 15:17.020
without some sort
of higher vision

15:17.140 --> 15:22.980
or without the awareness
of providence of a higher world.

15:23.110 --> 15:25.990
That was a central idea, uh,
to the ancient Egyptians.

15:27.240 --> 15:29.820
CHILDRESS:
The Eye of Horus

15:29.950 --> 15:32.990
is the eye of God
that sees everything.

15:34.950 --> 15:38.040
We're talking
about an Egyptian god

15:38.160 --> 15:40.920
who's quite possibly
an extraterrestrial.

15:42.250 --> 15:44.000
NARRATOR:
Many of the symbols found

15:44.130 --> 15:47.050
on ancient mummies,
like the Eye of Horus,

15:47.170 --> 15:50.890
have been used as tattoo designs
for centuries

15:51.010 --> 15:54.050
and are still popular
with tattoo enthusiasts today.

15:54.180 --> 15:56.930
But why do they endure?

15:57.060 --> 16:00.060
Is it possible
that a simple but iconic image

16:00.190 --> 16:03.150
of an eye devised
more than 3,000 years ago

16:03.270 --> 16:05.270
still speaks to humans today

16:05.400 --> 16:09.860
because we intuitively
understand the power behind it?

16:09.990 --> 16:11.910
HOROWITZ:
People adorn themselves

16:12.030 --> 16:15.160
with bodily art,
tattoos or body modification

16:15.280 --> 16:18.040
without knowing
why that pentagram

16:18.160 --> 16:20.120
or why that obelisk
or why that pyramid

16:20.250 --> 16:22.920
speaks so deeply to them.

16:23.040 --> 16:25.090
If you ask them,

16:25.210 --> 16:28.130
they might not be able
to give you a very clear answer,

16:28.260 --> 16:31.930
but their experience
of that symbol is answer enough.

16:33.050 --> 16:35.100
It inspires awe.

16:35.220 --> 16:38.020
It tells us that we come
from something larger.

16:38.140 --> 16:41.020
NARRATOR: Could the
tattoos of our ancestors

16:41.140 --> 16:44.020
contain a record
of humanity's past

16:44.150 --> 16:47.320
and messages meant for us
to decode today?

16:47.440 --> 16:52.240
Perhaps the answer can be found
by examining not just tattoos

16:52.360 --> 16:55.910
but far more extreme
body modifications.

17:03.870 --> 17:05.079
NARRATOR:
Tanna Island.

17:07.089 --> 17:10.089
Every year on February 15,

17:10.210 --> 17:13.930
residents of the Pacific
island chain of Vanuatu

17:14.050 --> 17:16.849
gather together here
for a military-style parade

17:16.970 --> 17:18.849
with "U.S.A." painted

17:18.970 --> 17:22.140
and sometimes even tattooed
on their chests.

17:22.270 --> 17:25.900
It is a tradition that began
more than 60 years ago

17:26.020 --> 17:28.069
and is inspired by events

17:28.190 --> 17:31.030
that took place
during World War II,

17:31.150 --> 17:34.910
when American forces descended
upon the remote island chain

17:35.030 --> 17:37.990
with modern machinery
and supplies.

17:41.040 --> 17:43.080
During the Second World War,

17:43.210 --> 17:45.920
when the Americans
reached the Pacific,

17:46.040 --> 17:48.960
um, and took over many
of the islands,

17:49.090 --> 17:52.050
supplies would be dropped
from aircraft

17:52.170 --> 17:55.930
or brought in on landing strips.

17:57.180 --> 18:00.010
And this brought many new things

18:00.140 --> 18:02.850
to these local populations,

18:02.980 --> 18:04.060
everything from canned foods

18:04.180 --> 18:07.150
to manufactured clothing

18:07.270 --> 18:10.190
to other items
they'd never seen before.

18:10.320 --> 18:13.030
NARRATOR: The native people,
who had never encountered

18:13.150 --> 18:15.200
this type
of modern civilization,

18:15.320 --> 18:17.870
were awed by these visitors
from the sky,

18:17.990 --> 18:20.910
who brang with them food
and gifts.

18:21.040 --> 18:22.950
All the aboriginals
were fascinated.

18:23.080 --> 18:24.330
They'd light up a cigarette.

18:24.460 --> 18:27.000
Hold out a voice recorder,
record their voice.

18:27.120 --> 18:29.000
The aboriginals
thought this was all magic.

18:30.420 --> 18:33.090
YOUNG:
They had never seen great ships

18:33.210 --> 18:35.260
and the goods, the-the weapons.

18:35.380 --> 18:38.300
Arthur C. Clarke's third law is:

18:38.430 --> 18:41.060
"Any sufficiently advanced
technology

18:41.180 --> 18:43.930
is indistinguishable
from magic."

18:47.190 --> 18:49.940
NARRATOR: After the war
in the Pacific concluded,

18:50.060 --> 18:53.150
the U.S. soldiers left
the islands, and overnight,

18:53.280 --> 18:56.820
the bounty of technology
and modern luxuries was gone.

19:00.160 --> 19:02.200
In memory
of the American soldiers

19:02.330 --> 19:05.200
and in the hope that it would
bring about their return,

19:05.330 --> 19:08.290
the natives formed a cult
devoted to the people

19:08.420 --> 19:11.920
who had visited them
from the sky.

19:12.040 --> 19:14.210
The people would try
and recreate

19:14.340 --> 19:19.010
the circumstances
that brought this cargo to them.

19:19.130 --> 19:22.100
They started to create
replica items

19:22.220 --> 19:25.890
associated with the Americans
and their presence,

19:26.020 --> 19:28.020
even rifles.

19:28.140 --> 19:30.230
MARTELL:
They would scrape away runways

19:30.350 --> 19:32.940
and make straw models
of the planes that landed

19:33.070 --> 19:35.110
to try and lure the soldiers

19:35.230 --> 19:37.990
to once again land and bring
all their amazing technology.

19:41.370 --> 19:45.870
Every religious experience
begins with the miraculous.

19:47.290 --> 19:49.960
Some individual or group

19:50.080 --> 19:52.290
will have an experience
where they feel

19:52.420 --> 19:55.170
they have witnessed something
or undergone something

19:55.300 --> 19:57.300
that is outside of the ordinary.

19:57.420 --> 19:59.340
And they will create

19:59.470 --> 20:03.010
monuments to that experience,

20:03.140 --> 20:05.260
whether it is the statue
of a deity,

20:05.390 --> 20:09.940
whether it is a pyramid,
whether it is a cathedral.

20:10.060 --> 20:12.100
We see this across history

20:12.230 --> 20:14.940
and all over the world
to this very day.

20:16.360 --> 20:18.240
NARRATOR:
Is it possible that,

20:18.360 --> 20:20.030
much like the so-called
cargo cults

20:20.150 --> 20:21.280
in the South Pacific,

20:21.410 --> 20:24.200
ancient people
also constructed monuments

20:24.320 --> 20:26.330
and even entire religions

20:26.450 --> 20:30.330
based on interactions
with visitors from the sky?

20:30.460 --> 20:33.170
MARTELL: The term "cargo
cult" is very interesting

20:33.290 --> 20:35.290
when applied
to the ancient astronaut theory,

20:35.420 --> 20:38.380
because we can see
that even in modern times

20:38.510 --> 20:42.260
how man has interacted
with things coming from the sky

20:42.380 --> 20:45.140
or other technology
they didn't understand.

20:45.260 --> 20:47.220
This has been playing out
for thousands of years

20:47.350 --> 20:49.220
here on Earth.

20:51.560 --> 20:54.060
NARRATOR:
If extraterrestrial visitation

20:54.190 --> 20:56.110
inspired the ancient people

20:56.230 --> 20:58.320
to build temples
in a certain fashion

20:58.440 --> 21:01.400
and attempt to reproduce
misunderstood technology,

21:01.530 --> 21:03.360
could it also
have motivated them

21:03.490 --> 21:07.370
to tattoo and otherwise modify
their bodies

21:07.490 --> 21:11.330
similar to how the people
of Vanuatu adorn their chests

21:11.460 --> 21:14.330
with the letters "U.S.A.,"

21:14.460 --> 21:17.130
continuing to imitate
the soldiers who visited

21:17.250 --> 21:20.210
before most of the islanders
were even born?

21:22.170 --> 21:24.220
Ancient astronaut
theorists suggest

21:24.340 --> 21:27.050
additional evidence
that cargo cult practices

21:27.180 --> 21:29.350
include body modifications

21:29.470 --> 21:32.140
can be found by examining
numerous other cultures

21:32.270 --> 21:33.440
throughout the world
that also undergo

21:33.560 --> 21:36.310
extreme body alterations.

21:38.110 --> 21:40.320
♪ ♪

21:40.440 --> 21:45.200
In Brazil, the Kayapo worship
a god they call Bep Kororoti,

21:45.320 --> 21:48.330
who they depict in ceremonies
with a straw suit

21:48.450 --> 21:53.330
that is eerily reminiscent
of a modern-day spacesuit.

21:53.460 --> 21:57.290
Their traditions include
intricate body painting,

21:57.420 --> 22:01.300
face tattooing, lip stretching
and peculiar haircuts,

22:01.420 --> 22:05.340
all to harness the power
of this otherworldly being.

22:07.430 --> 22:10.220
And perhaps the most extreme
body modification of all

22:10.350 --> 22:13.310
is practiced by
the Kayan people of Burma.

22:13.430 --> 22:15.140
COLLINS:
There is a tradition

22:15.270 --> 22:18.270
amongst the Kayan people

22:18.400 --> 22:20.480
of the women wearing

22:20.610 --> 22:26.360
these spiraling brass rings
in their neck.

22:26.490 --> 22:30.160
And they wear these
throughout their life,

22:30.280 --> 22:32.370
and it can take many, many hours

22:32.490 --> 22:36.370
to actually put these coils
in place.

22:36.500 --> 22:39.500
There is a tradition
that this female dragon

22:39.630 --> 22:43.340
had begun the dynasty
of the Kayan people,

22:43.460 --> 22:47.430
and that the reason they do this
is to resemble this dragon.

22:47.550 --> 22:50.510
STEAVU:
In Kayan foundational mythology,

22:50.640 --> 22:53.390
dragons play
a very prominent role,

22:53.520 --> 22:55.390
that act as messengers
between the world

22:55.520 --> 22:57.350
of the divine
and the world of humans.

22:57.480 --> 23:00.440
They are very powerful,
magical creatures as well,

23:00.560 --> 23:04.150
and they're associated
with ultimate knowledge.

23:04.280 --> 23:06.360
Is it possible
that this creature

23:06.490 --> 23:08.530
actually came from the sky world

23:08.660 --> 23:12.410
and was seen to be the influence

23:12.530 --> 23:15.200
behind the foundation
of these people,

23:15.330 --> 23:18.120
a memory which
they never forgot?

23:24.460 --> 23:26.380
NARRATOR: Could it be
that there are cultures

23:26.510 --> 23:28.220
around the world today

23:28.340 --> 23:30.220
keeping alive an ancient story

23:30.340 --> 23:33.640
of alien visitation
by altering their flesh?

23:33.760 --> 23:35.640
And is it possible
that the growing trend

23:35.770 --> 23:38.390
of body modification
in the modern world

23:38.520 --> 23:40.400
is due to a deep-seated memory

23:40.520 --> 23:43.110
of our extraterrestrial origins?

23:44.780 --> 23:47.490
Perhaps further clues
can be found by examining

23:47.610 --> 23:50.280
one of the most
peculiar practices

23:50.410 --> 23:54.200
of the ancient world:
Head binding.

24:07.460 --> 24:11.010
of the mysterious ancient site
of Puma Punku,

24:11.130 --> 24:15.100
archaeologists uncover
500-year-old tombs

24:15.220 --> 24:17.980
believed to have been built
by a pre-Incan civilization

24:18.100 --> 24:21.100
called the Pacajes.

24:21.230 --> 24:25.320
The remains of more than 100
people are discovered within,

24:25.440 --> 24:27.360
and a number of the skulls

24:27.480 --> 24:31.030
are found to have
a very bizarre abnormality.

24:31.150 --> 24:34.120
They appear
dramatically elongated.

24:36.120 --> 24:37.200
According to archaeologists,

24:37.330 --> 24:39.290
these specimens display evidence

24:39.410 --> 24:44.250
of a body modification practice
called head binding.

24:44.380 --> 24:48.010
The head can be changed
in its shape.

24:48.130 --> 24:50.300
Generally, it's elongated.

24:50.420 --> 24:54.050
And this is done when a child
is perhaps six months old

24:54.180 --> 24:56.220
through to the age of three.

24:56.350 --> 24:58.350
And their heads are bound up,

24:58.470 --> 25:01.230
and this pushes
the skull upwards

25:01.350 --> 25:03.980
and creates
these bizarre shapes.

25:04.100 --> 25:06.020
Just by gazing upon them,

25:06.150 --> 25:08.280
you can't help think alien,

25:08.400 --> 25:10.990
because that's what
they truly look like.

25:14.410 --> 25:18.240
NARRATOR: Curiously,
this extreme form of body modification

25:18.370 --> 25:21.290
was widespread throughout
the ancient world,

25:21.410 --> 25:24.170
occurring on nearly
every continent

25:24.290 --> 25:27.210
and practiced by many cultures
that are believed to have had

25:27.340 --> 25:29.250
no contact with one another.

25:31.510 --> 25:34.130
This is a process
that has been going on

25:34.260 --> 25:37.260
at least for the last
10,000 years

25:37.390 --> 25:40.100
and is found
in every part of the world,

25:40.220 --> 25:44.230
from the Pacific islands
to Australia,

25:44.350 --> 25:47.480
to the Near East,
to the Americas.

25:47.610 --> 25:53.240
And the strangest
are those of Paracas in Peru.

25:53.360 --> 25:56.240
Everywhere,
we find this same process.

25:56.360 --> 25:59.030
It seems as if
it was mimicking people

25:59.160 --> 26:00.450
who originally existed

26:00.580 --> 26:03.370
that had long heads
in the first place.

26:05.460 --> 26:08.540
CHILDRESS: In Vanuatu,
anthropologists asked

26:08.670 --> 26:12.510
the people who were still doing
head binding up until the 1960s,

26:12.630 --> 26:15.430
and they asked them why
they did that, and they said,

26:15.550 --> 26:18.470
"This is what the gods look like
with these elongated heads."

26:18.600 --> 26:21.260
And if that is the explanation
for head binding

26:21.390 --> 26:24.140
around the world,
then who are these gods?

26:24.270 --> 26:26.270
They're apparently
extraterrestrials

26:26.390 --> 26:29.270
who have
a naturally elongated head

26:29.400 --> 26:32.150
that's just part of their DNA,

26:32.280 --> 26:34.320
and humans want to look
like them.

26:36.700 --> 26:40.200
NARRATOR: If ancient people
did encounter extraterrestrials

26:40.330 --> 26:44.250
and perhaps even
coexisted with them,

26:44.370 --> 26:46.370
might there have been something
more profound at play

26:46.500 --> 26:49.210
than mere deification
and imitation?

26:50.630 --> 26:53.210
Some ancient astronaut
theorists believe

26:53.340 --> 26:57.340
that it may, in fact,
be programmed into human DNA

26:57.470 --> 27:00.220
to want to become more like
our alien ancestors.

27:01.430 --> 27:03.180
And that ancient traditions

27:03.310 --> 27:05.430
of body modification
and tattooing

27:05.560 --> 27:08.400
represent practice runs,

27:08.520 --> 27:12.270
preparing for the day
when we could alter ourselves

27:12.400 --> 27:15.400
to actually become
like the aliens.

27:17.450 --> 27:19.280
Vancouver, British Columbia.

27:21.240 --> 27:24.580
August 13, 2019.

27:24.700 --> 27:27.540
Ancient astronaut theorist
William Henry

27:27.660 --> 27:31.500
visits self-described
transhumanist Russ Foxx...

27:31.630 --> 27:33.550
- Yeah, he's in his room right there.
- Oh, thank you.

27:33.670 --> 27:35.380
NARRATOR: To get a
firsthand look at technology

27:35.510 --> 27:38.430
that proposes to transform
the human race.

27:38.550 --> 27:40.260
- FOXX: Hi, William.
- Hi. How are you?

27:40.390 --> 27:41.220
I'm William Henry.
Pleasure to meet you.

27:41.340 --> 27:42.430
Good to meet you. Grab a seat.

27:42.550 --> 27:44.260
- Thank you very much.
- This is Eric.

27:44.390 --> 27:45.470
- Hi, Eric. How are you?
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

27:45.600 --> 27:46.430
Pleasure to meet you as well.

27:48.440 --> 27:50.350
NARRATOR:
In his 2015 book,

27:50.480 --> 27:52.360
<i>The Skingularity Is Near,</i>

27:52.480 --> 27:54.440
William Henry proposed

27:54.570 --> 27:56.480
that humankind
is reaching a point

27:56.610 --> 27:59.450
where the body will be
radically transformed.

27:59.570 --> 28:01.200
Well, you came at a perfect
time... Eric is going to

28:01.320 --> 28:02.160
have an NFC chip
installed today.

28:02.280 --> 28:03.370
Fantastic.

28:03.490 --> 28:06.370
I will begin by cleaning
your hand.

28:06.490 --> 28:07.580
NARRATOR:
He is eager to investigate

28:07.700 --> 28:11.210
how this is already
beginning to happen.

28:11.330 --> 28:12.540
Russ prepares to implant Eric

28:12.670 --> 28:15.340
with a biocompatible
glass tube...

28:15.460 --> 28:16.590
FOXX: So we are ready
to install the chip.

28:16.710 --> 28:19.420
NARRATOR:
Containing an NFC microchip.

28:19.550 --> 28:21.430
FOXX: So the implant
itself was pre-sterilized

28:21.550 --> 28:23.470
and loaded into a syringe,
so it will be

28:23.600 --> 28:25.350
literally injected
under the skin.

28:28.310 --> 28:29.430
You now have a chip.

28:32.520 --> 28:35.570
NARRATOR: NFC stands for
"near-field communication,"

28:35.690 --> 28:40.490
and it allows phones, tablets,
laptops and other devices

28:40.610 --> 28:44.660
to easily share data with other
NFC-equipped devices.

28:44.780 --> 28:49.500
So, Russ, what-what technologies
have you got implanted?

28:49.620 --> 28:51.670
I personally have a number
of different chips

28:51.790 --> 28:56.380
in both of my hands, as well
as a magnetic vision implant,

28:56.500 --> 28:58.380
an RFID and an NFC
in either side

28:58.510 --> 28:59.880
- with different purposes.
- Mm-hmm.

29:00.010 --> 29:04.340
This NFC chip has all of
my business links and web URLs.

29:04.470 --> 29:06.430
And this is
a built-in business card.

29:06.550 --> 29:07.600
So I can actually
scan it with your phone

29:07.720 --> 29:09.180
and give you my contact info.

29:10.680 --> 29:13.350
Just like that,
and it brings up my contact info

29:13.480 --> 29:15.400
- and saves it in your phone.
- Wow.

29:15.520 --> 29:17.320
Look at that.
So I've got your phone number.

29:17.440 --> 29:18.570
I've got your contact details.

29:18.690 --> 29:20.360
So, all of these things,

29:20.490 --> 29:22.280
you use it
to start your motorcycle,

29:22.400 --> 29:23.530
get in your home...

29:23.660 --> 29:25.450
I replaced my keys
with these chips,

29:25.570 --> 29:27.330
so that way,
I don't have to deal

29:27.450 --> 29:28.410
with losing
or having keys stolen.

29:28.540 --> 29:29.450
So these chips interact
with a lot

29:29.580 --> 29:31.450
of different devices in my life.

29:31.580 --> 29:32.660
I could bring you to my house
and show you some of them.

29:32.790 --> 29:34.370
- I'd love that.
- Let's go for a trip.

29:34.500 --> 29:36.420
- Right on.
- Okay.

29:36.540 --> 29:39.800
HENRY: Humanity has a long
history of interaction

29:39.920 --> 29:43.590
with extraterrestrial beings
who came here with technology.

29:43.720 --> 29:46.590
And humans have long tried

29:46.720 --> 29:49.560
to imitate or be like the gods.

29:49.680 --> 29:52.560
So I will wake up the bike
with my RFID chip.

29:52.680 --> 29:54.310
- I introduce it to the sensor.
- HENRY: Okay.

29:54.440 --> 29:56.310
FOXX:
And the bike is awake.

29:56.440 --> 29:57.440
- Awesome. Okay.
- Just like that.

29:57.560 --> 29:58.650
HENRY:
And now today,

29:58.770 --> 30:00.480
we have transhuman technology

30:00.610 --> 30:03.400
where we're augmenting
the physical body

30:03.530 --> 30:05.660
in an effort to duplicate many
of the capacities

30:05.780 --> 30:08.200
that we attribute
to the ancient gods.

30:08.330 --> 30:09.620
♪ ♪

30:11.580 --> 30:12.620
So, to access my home,

30:12.750 --> 30:14.790
- I scan my chip...
- Ah.

30:14.910 --> 30:16.670
- And the door's unlocked. We can enter.
- Very nice.

30:16.790 --> 30:18.540
- After you.
- Thank you.

30:18.670 --> 30:19.840
HENRY:
What I'm hoping to see here

30:19.960 --> 30:22.380
by coming to Russ's home
is to see the future.

30:22.510 --> 30:24.380
Where is Russ going to go
with this?

30:24.510 --> 30:26.550
What has he got access to
in his own home,

30:26.680 --> 30:28.430
and-and how is that
gonna change him?

30:28.550 --> 30:29.680
- So this is my dining room table.
- Okay.

30:29.800 --> 30:32.520
Which doubles as
an RFID-operated safe.

30:32.640 --> 30:34.310
- Ah.
- What I do is I scan

30:34.430 --> 30:35.560
my RFID chip on top.

30:35.690 --> 30:37.440
(lock clicks)

30:37.560 --> 30:39.520
A slip hinge...
and there's my drawer.

30:39.650 --> 30:41.440
Ah, very nice. Beautiful.

30:41.570 --> 30:42.900
So these devices in here

30:43.030 --> 30:45.650
- are implantable technology pieces I have.
- Mm-hmm.

30:45.780 --> 30:48.280
- And I will show you what they are.
- Fantastic.

30:50.870 --> 30:54.620
So, this first device,
this is called a North Sense.

30:54.750 --> 30:58.330
This device is mounted
to the body with piercings.

30:58.460 --> 30:59.670
This device will vibrate

30:59.790 --> 31:01.630
whenever it faces
magnetic north,

31:01.750 --> 31:03.710
essentially turning you
into a human compass.

31:03.840 --> 31:08.510
And here we have
some magnet implants.

31:08.640 --> 31:11.720
So, this is a small chip
that encases tritium gas,

31:11.850 --> 31:14.640
and it will glow
right through your skin.

31:14.770 --> 31:17.390
And because it is, uh,
radioactive material,

31:17.520 --> 31:19.520
it's not, um, battery powered.

31:19.650 --> 31:21.690
It will constantly glow,
and it has

31:21.820 --> 31:24.570
- a 12-year half-life.
- Wow.

31:24.690 --> 31:26.530
At what point do we become
more than human

31:26.650 --> 31:28.410
in the transhuman process?

31:28.530 --> 31:29.860
I think that we're-we're always

31:29.990 --> 31:32.530
going to be building on
to our existing humanity,

31:32.660 --> 31:35.580
but it's important to appreciate
our existing humanity.

31:35.700 --> 31:37.500
We don't want to lose touch
with that.

31:37.620 --> 31:39.790
HENRY: When I look at
Russ, I see someone

31:39.920 --> 31:41.630
who's on the cutting edge
of our technology,

31:41.750 --> 31:43.590
but he's just the beginning

31:43.710 --> 31:45.710
of where we potentially
can go with this.

31:45.840 --> 31:48.760
We're talking about transforming
humans into super beings.

31:48.880 --> 31:51.590
NARRATOR:
With the emergence of technology

31:51.720 --> 31:53.720
that can be implanted
within the flesh,

31:53.850 --> 31:57.480
is humankind on the brink
of possessing abilities

31:57.600 --> 31:59.770
similar to those described
by ancient people

31:59.890 --> 32:02.480
in reference to their gods?

32:03.570 --> 32:05.610
Has body modification

32:05.730 --> 32:07.690
all been a preparation
for this evolution?

32:09.650 --> 32:11.700
Perhaps further clues
can be found

32:11.820 --> 32:16.700
by examining plans to merge
tattoos with technology.

32:21.370 --> 32:23.290
NARRATOR:
Boulder, Colorado.

32:25.380 --> 32:27.420
2018.

32:29.550 --> 32:31.470
At the University of Colorado,

32:31.590 --> 32:34.510
Dr. Carson Bruns
and a team of scientists

32:34.640 --> 32:37.600
begins work on developing
a new technology

32:37.720 --> 32:41.440
that promises to transform
what it means to get ink...

32:41.560 --> 32:44.560
"smart tattoos."

32:44.690 --> 32:46.650
BRUNS: We're trying to
engineer new tattoo inks

32:46.770 --> 32:49.440
that will add new function
to your skin.

32:49.570 --> 32:52.610
The first one that we invented
is a UV-sensitive tattoo ink.

32:52.740 --> 32:56.450
It's basically invisible under
normal lighting conditions,

32:56.580 --> 32:59.370
but when you go outside
in intense sunshine

32:59.500 --> 33:02.330
and it gets exposed
to the UV lights...

33:02.460 --> 33:03.540
That high-energy part
of sunshine

33:03.670 --> 33:06.340
that causes skin cancer
and sunburn...

33:06.460 --> 33:08.510
It turns blue
and acts like an indicator

33:08.630 --> 33:11.550
that shows you that your skin
is dangerously exposed

33:11.670 --> 33:14.340
to high levels
of dangerous radiation.

33:16.760 --> 33:19.560
NARRATOR: Dr. Bruns has
also created tattoo inks

33:19.680 --> 33:22.600
that change color as the body's
temperature changes,

33:22.730 --> 33:26.440
essentially creating
a human on board thermometer

33:26.560 --> 33:29.320
accessible at any time.

33:29.440 --> 33:30.650
BRUNS:
We can use nanotechnology

33:30.780 --> 33:33.360
to engineer tattoo particles

33:33.490 --> 33:35.490
so that they have
special properties,

33:35.620 --> 33:37.740
like a thermal battery

33:37.870 --> 33:40.660
or a thermal storage type
of mechanism.

33:40.790 --> 33:43.410
And so one thing that you can
imagine doing with a tattoo

33:43.540 --> 33:45.540
would be covering
your entire body

33:45.670 --> 33:48.500
with a sort of thermal
storage material

33:48.630 --> 33:52.420
that would keep your body
at a comfortable temperature

33:52.550 --> 33:54.300
when you went out
into the extreme heat

33:54.430 --> 33:56.260
or the extreme cold.

33:58.600 --> 34:00.600
NARRATOR: Smart tattoos
are even being engineered

34:00.720 --> 34:03.560
to monitor and treat
health conditions.

34:03.690 --> 34:05.690
BRUNS:
If we have a chronic condition

34:05.810 --> 34:08.610
that needs drugs,
we can envision a tattoo ink

34:08.730 --> 34:11.570
that slowly releases a drug
or a hormone

34:11.690 --> 34:13.739
into your body
that helps regulate

34:13.860 --> 34:16.699
either your blood chemistry
or your mood.

34:16.820 --> 34:21.449
I also envision tattoos that can
really strengthen our skin,

34:21.580 --> 34:25.670
make our skin stronger
to forces and-and damage.

34:25.790 --> 34:30.460
The military may have a lot
of use for full-body tattoos

34:30.590 --> 34:32.760
that can help protect soldiers,
for example,

34:32.880 --> 34:36.510
from certain types
of skin damage.

34:36.630 --> 34:39.600
HENRY: Carson Bruns is
doing fascinating work

34:39.719 --> 34:41.719
on the human skin.

34:41.850 --> 34:44.730
He believes that we can change
the nature of skin altogether,

34:44.850 --> 34:49.440
using skin as a new platform
for technological development.

34:49.560 --> 34:52.480
Humans have always tried
to imitate the gods,

34:52.610 --> 34:55.360
and perhaps tattoos are
a reflection of this.

34:55.489 --> 34:57.530
In ancient times,

34:57.660 --> 35:00.450
they might have seen the gods
wearing something like tattoos,

35:00.580 --> 35:02.450
and they started tattooing
their own bodies

35:02.580 --> 35:04.750
in imitation
of what the gods were wearing.

35:04.870 --> 35:08.710
But today, we now have
technology that is equal

35:08.830 --> 35:12.590
to what we see the gods using
in these ancient stories.

35:12.710 --> 35:16.420
Maybe now we're going to be able
to turn ourselves into

35:16.550 --> 35:18.510
a species just like the gods.

35:18.640 --> 35:21.550
NARRATOR: Is it possible
that ancient people

35:21.680 --> 35:24.430
came into contact
with more advanced beings

35:24.560 --> 35:26.560
that had smart tattoos

35:26.680 --> 35:29.650
much like those
that are being developed today?

35:29.770 --> 35:31.860
Could these
otherworldly visitors

35:31.980 --> 35:34.780
have had technology hidden
within their skin,

35:34.900 --> 35:37.740
appearing as artwork?

35:37.860 --> 35:40.780
Conducting tattoos that we're
working on are black right now,

35:40.910 --> 35:43.830
so it looks like an ordinary
black tattoo pigment.

35:43.950 --> 35:46.500
But you could even merge
the technology

35:46.620 --> 35:47.960
with the art
so that you could have

35:48.080 --> 35:50.630
a tattoo that looks
like a normal artistic tattoo

35:50.750 --> 35:52.710
but has this hidden function

35:52.840 --> 35:55.800
as some kind of electronic
or detecting device.

35:55.920 --> 35:59.630
NARRATOR: As far as ancient
astronaut theorists are concerned,

35:59.760 --> 36:01.550
with such technology,

36:01.680 --> 36:03.640
extraterrestrials could truly
have appeared

36:03.760 --> 36:05.680
to be gods to ancient people.

36:05.810 --> 36:09.600
And they believe
humanity is very close

36:09.730 --> 36:12.480
to becoming
like these alien ancestors.

36:15.860 --> 36:17.530
Silicon Valley.

36:18.740 --> 36:21.660
2018.

36:21.780 --> 36:25.910
Futurist Elon Musk introduces
a new technology venture

36:26.040 --> 36:29.500
aimed at what is known
as "self-directed evolution."

36:29.620 --> 36:32.790
He calls it "Neuralink."

36:32.920 --> 36:35.840
By means of a special
hypodermic needle,

36:35.960 --> 36:38.760
the company intends
to inject an ultra thin mesh,

36:38.880 --> 36:42.510
called a "neuro lace,"
within the neocortex,

36:42.640 --> 36:43.930
forming a body of electrodes

36:44.050 --> 36:46.430
that are able
to monitor brain function.

36:47.850 --> 36:50.690
A neural lace uses
microelectrodes

36:50.810 --> 36:52.600
they place inside of the brain

36:52.730 --> 36:55.690
that can actually read
and write onto neurons.

36:55.820 --> 36:57.860
It's a bidirectional
informational exchange.

36:57.980 --> 37:00.570
And it eventually will allow you

37:00.700 --> 37:02.910
to receive information
from the Internet.

37:03.030 --> 37:05.700
FOXX:
Through the use of Neuralinking,

37:05.830 --> 37:07.870
we can connect brains

37:07.990 --> 37:11.750
through the Internet
or through technology.

37:11.870 --> 37:14.750
When this is the case, we can
send thoughts to one another.

37:14.880 --> 37:16.960
BRUNS:
Another thing you could do,

37:17.090 --> 37:20.720
if you were able
to read brain activity,

37:20.840 --> 37:24.640
would be to control devices
remotely with your mind.

37:24.760 --> 37:27.810
So, it would give us telekinesis
in principle, as well.

37:28.970 --> 37:30.640
NARRATOR:
The technology

37:30.770 --> 37:32.810
that Elon Musk is developing

37:32.940 --> 37:34.600
could potentially also
be applied to the human body

37:34.730 --> 37:37.730
in the form of tattoos.

37:37.860 --> 37:40.740
Nanotechnology is allowing us
to make electronics small enough

37:40.860 --> 37:45.780
so when tattooable electronics
come online,

37:45.910 --> 37:49.950
you can do things
like a scalp tattoo.

37:50.080 --> 37:53.750
If we're able
to read brain activity

37:53.870 --> 37:57.670
from this sort of seamless and
permanent interface in our skin,

37:57.790 --> 38:00.800
you could imagine
a new form of communication,

38:00.920 --> 38:03.550
almost sort of
a technological telepathy.

38:05.760 --> 38:07.680
NARRATOR:
Is humanity nearing a time

38:07.800 --> 38:09.970
when we will no longer be
a cargo cult...

38:10.100 --> 38:13.640
Unknowingly mimicking
a far more advanced civilization

38:13.770 --> 38:16.850
that once visited Earth...
But will, in fact,

38:16.980 --> 38:20.860
become just like
these extraterrestrial visitors?

38:20.980 --> 38:24.900
Have we evolved
from imitation to replication?

38:25.030 --> 38:28.700
Perhaps further clues
can be found

38:28.830 --> 38:30.700
by examining new developments
in body modification

38:30.830 --> 38:33.700
designed to facilitate
space travel.

38:38.880 --> 38:40.880
ATOR:
In the 21st century,

38:41.000 --> 38:44.550
tattoos and body modifications
are no longer fringe

38:44.670 --> 38:46.840
and no longer merely decorative.

38:46.970 --> 38:49.760
Technology implanted
within the flesh

38:49.890 --> 38:53.600
can facilitate
superhuman abilities.

38:53.720 --> 38:56.810
But of greatest interest
to ancient astronaut theorists

38:56.940 --> 38:59.810
is the role that smart tattoos
could potentially play

38:59.940 --> 39:01.860
in space travel.

39:01.980 --> 39:04.780
BRUNS: The next generation
of space suits

39:04.900 --> 39:07.860
are gonna be embedded
with a lot more technologies,

39:07.990 --> 39:09.950
and it's possible
to make tattoos

39:10.070 --> 39:11.870
that can interact
with the space suit.

39:11.990 --> 39:14.580
You can imagine even
a space suit

39:14.700 --> 39:16.750
that would be able
to read out information

39:16.870 --> 39:17.920
that those tattoos are providing

39:18.040 --> 39:21.750
and send them back
to mission control.

39:21.880 --> 39:25.760
NARRATOR: Scientists are even
beginning to develop technology

39:25.880 --> 39:28.800
that could make
space suits obsolete.

39:28.930 --> 39:32.810
We can use nanotechnology
to engineer tattoo particles

39:32.930 --> 39:34.850
so that they have
special properties

39:34.970 --> 39:36.850
covering your entire body.

39:36.980 --> 39:41.650
Super skin, E-skin, I-skin is

39:41.770 --> 39:44.860
skin that is enhanced
or laced with technology.

39:44.980 --> 39:48.910
Since 2002, the U.S. military
has been very interested

39:49.030 --> 39:51.780
in creating a new skin
for the military.

39:51.910 --> 39:55.660
This augmentation
will transform us from humans

39:55.790 --> 39:58.540
into the next level
of evolution,

39:58.660 --> 40:00.670
augmenting the body

40:00.790 --> 40:02.840
to make us smarter,
to make us stronger.

40:02.960 --> 40:04.960
BRUNS: We're gonna keep
improving the technologies,

40:05.090 --> 40:07.670
and we're gonna keep
embedding them

40:07.800 --> 40:10.590
more and more intimately
with our bodies

40:10.720 --> 40:13.680
to improve our abilities
as humans

40:13.800 --> 40:16.930
and ultimately
give us more power.

40:17.060 --> 40:20.690
NARRATOR: But if the first humans
to apply tattoos to their flesh

40:20.810 --> 40:22.940
and perform
other body modifications,

40:23.060 --> 40:25.650
such as head binding,
were attempting

40:25.780 --> 40:27.690
to imitate extraterrestrials,

40:27.820 --> 40:29.860
are the technological
enhancements

40:29.990 --> 40:33.620
we're making to our bodies today
part of our destiny?

40:33.740 --> 40:36.580
And if so, where does it lead?

40:37.910 --> 40:39.830
HENRY:
Through nanotechnology,

40:39.960 --> 40:43.790
we can augment the skin
to make it more adaptable

40:43.920 --> 40:45.840
to living in space.

40:45.960 --> 40:47.920
To make us smarter,
to make us stronger,

40:48.050 --> 40:50.840
to make us more resilient.

40:50.970 --> 40:53.840
We're able to become
like the gods

40:53.970 --> 40:55.930
through the implantation
of this technology.

40:56.060 --> 40:58.810
BARRETTA: When you take it
right back to its roots,

40:58.930 --> 41:01.060
tattooing is very transformative

41:01.190 --> 41:05.820
and has a lot of roots
in what we would call magic.

41:05.940 --> 41:08.650
And our ancient ancestors
were very much

41:08.780 --> 41:10.780
in tune with the cosmos.

41:10.900 --> 41:13.070
And what we're doing right now,
we're bringing this back

41:13.200 --> 41:15.950
to the magical modality
that it is.

41:16.080 --> 41:18.080
This adornment now...

41:18.200 --> 41:21.620
Is this making us more
extraterrestrial-like?

41:22.960 --> 41:24.830
SCOTT:
Any advanced alien species

41:24.960 --> 41:27.090
that makes it across the galaxy

41:27.210 --> 41:30.720
is going to have learned how
to self-direct their evolution.

41:30.840 --> 41:32.880
We are augmenting our bodies

41:33.010 --> 41:35.800
and moving forward
with our evolution.

41:35.930 --> 41:38.810
NARRATOR: Is there a message
about humanity's future

41:38.930 --> 41:43.690
encoded in our very flesh
and our attempts to alter it?

41:43.810 --> 41:46.770
Could it be that tattoos,
piercings

41:46.900 --> 41:49.730
and body modifications
are inspired

41:49.860 --> 41:52.950
by extraterrestrial visitors
from the past?

41:53.070 --> 41:56.820
Perhaps we are just now arriving
at a destiny

41:56.950 --> 42:00.870
that has been foretold
through human hieroglyphs.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.830
One in which
we will become the equals

42:03.960 --> 42:05.880
of our alien ancestors.
