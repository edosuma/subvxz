Kevin, Kevin, Kevin,
Kevin, Kevin, Kevin.

00:38.911 --> 00:42.351
Kevin, Kevin, Kevin.

00:44.121 --> 00:46.025
Oh, Edith, it's just you.

00:47.696 --> 00:49.165
That's weird.

00:49.165 --> 00:52.204
Where's the pile
of paper plates in the sink?

00:52.204 --> 00:55.277
And crusty laundry mountain?

00:55.277 --> 00:57.047
And why is the toilet flushed?

00:57.047 --> 00:59.385
What is happening?

01:01.356 --> 01:04.195
Where did all your fur go?

01:04.195 --> 01:05.632
And he keeps telling me
that Friday

01:05.632 --> 01:07.468
is going to be
the most important day

01:07.569 --> 01:09.573
of our lives.
What does it all mean?

01:09.573 --> 01:12.211
Buddy, the flowers?
The clean apartment?

01:12.211 --> 01:13.948
The shaved rub-a-dub?

01:13.948 --> 01:15.284
Bit soon for a recap.

01:15.284 --> 01:17.889
It's yours and Kevin's
anniversary.

01:17.889 --> 01:19.526
Oh, my gosh, you're right.

01:19.526 --> 01:21.697
It probably has been
however long a year is

01:21.697 --> 01:22.732
since Dana left me at Kevin's

01:22.732 --> 01:24.435
and Kevin was too spiteful
to return me to her.

01:24.435 --> 01:26.005
What do I get him?
I always forget,

01:26.005 --> 01:27.509
is one year paper
or a dead rat?

01:27.509 --> 01:30.314
Blech. All cats know
rat is apology gift.

01:30.314 --> 01:32.819
Birds are anniversary gift.

01:32.819 --> 01:34.121
But what kind of bird?

01:34.121 --> 01:35.424
It has to be perfect.

01:35.424 --> 01:36.894
Tabitha, you like to shop.

01:36.994 --> 01:38.998
Maybe you could help Chico
find a bird.

01:38.998 --> 01:40.768
I can catch a bird on my own.

01:40.768 --> 01:43.206
I just have to find the hive
and take out the queen.

01:43.206 --> 01:45.243
Ugh, this is going to be disaster

01:45.243 --> 01:47.181
of the most boring proportions,

01:47.181 --> 01:49.920
but I will allow you
to be helped by me.

01:49.920 --> 01:51.857
I find bird, you kill it.

01:51.857 --> 01:53.059
Limited time offer.

01:53.059 --> 01:54.362
Take the deal! Take it!

01:54.462 --> 01:56.432
Ugh, I'd kill
to keep my Kevin.

01:56.432 --> 01:58.904
No. Kevin is mine.
You can't have him.

01:58.904 --> 02:01.142
No, no, no, no.
My special someone.

02:01.142 --> 02:02.746
Her name is Sophie B.

02:02.746 --> 02:04.616
A tween angel from my classroom

02:04.616 --> 02:06.654
who only eats her boogers
when she's stressed.

02:06.654 --> 02:08.624
She took me home
for the long weekend

02:08.624 --> 02:11.062
and it's been amazing.

02:11.162 --> 02:13.166
I gotta get you
nice and clean

02:13.166 --> 02:14.302
for your date to the ball.

02:14.302 --> 02:17.341
I'm going to ball?
And I have a date?

02:17.341 --> 02:20.414
- Ta-da.
- Holy cow!

02:20.414 --> 02:22.217
But it's all gonna end tomorrow

02:22.217 --> 02:24.322
when she takes me
back to school.

02:24.322 --> 02:26.894
And that means one thing, loneliness.

02:26.894 --> 02:27.796
If you're so lonely,

02:27.896 --> 02:30.334
why do you keep eating
your mates' faces?

02:30.334 --> 02:33.373
Because I'm complicated.
That's why I'm here.

02:33.373 --> 02:35.645
I just don't want my time
with Sophie B. to end.

02:35.645 --> 02:37.448
Well, I can't believe
I'm saying this,

02:37.448 --> 02:39.485
but longer isn't always better.

02:39.485 --> 02:42.692
Mine and Darla's river
of liquid love has run dry.

02:42.692 --> 02:44.696
'Tis better to have
short-lived passion

02:44.696 --> 02:47.267
than watch your romance
grow old and wither.

02:47.267 --> 02:49.405
Cherish it
while it's still moist.

02:49.405 --> 02:52.311
Don't listen to him.
Romance doesn't have to wither.

02:52.311 --> 02:53.981
Chief and I have been married
for six years.

02:53.981 --> 02:57.388
And aside from the one time
I ran away with a coyote and--

02:57.388 --> 02:59.392
Okay, wait,
you think you're married?

02:59.392 --> 03:01.095
I don't think we're married.

03:01.095 --> 03:03.667
I know we're married. See?

03:03.667 --> 03:06.472
By that logic,
you're also Batman and Robin.

03:08.243 --> 03:09.980
Just because Jill
dressed you up

03:09.980 --> 03:12.484
in that unflattering
flammable costume,

03:12.585 --> 03:14.355
doesn't mean
you have to limit yourself

03:14.355 --> 03:16.527
to that failed human construct.

03:16.527 --> 03:18.229
We're not limiting ourselves.

03:18.229 --> 03:21.002
You know my motto, "No limits."

03:21.002 --> 03:22.271
What else would we be doing?

03:22.271 --> 03:24.141
Playing with other dogs.

03:24.141 --> 03:26.179
Or tortoises. Think about it.

03:26.179 --> 03:27.549
We've played with other dogs,

03:27.549 --> 03:29.619
but we prefer
playing with each other.

03:29.619 --> 03:31.657
Because you think
you have to.

03:31.657 --> 03:33.594
But now you can play
with other dogs

03:33.594 --> 03:35.965
and don't have to pretend
you prefer to play with Chief

03:36.199 --> 03:37.669
or he with you.

03:39.338 --> 03:41.175
I'll just let that sit there.

03:41.175 --> 03:42.912
Okay, everyone out.

03:44.482 --> 03:47.121
So what do you think?

03:47.121 --> 03:49.492
Well, it's a lot to process.

03:49.492 --> 03:52.064
We're not Batman and Robin?

03:52.064 --> 03:53.233
No, the other part.

03:53.233 --> 03:54.903
What do you think
about not behaving

03:54.903 --> 03:55.938
like we're married?

03:55.938 --> 03:57.609
Would you wanna play
with other dogs,

03:57.609 --> 03:59.579
take ol' Honey-bee
out of the equation?

03:59.579 --> 04:01.683
- Who's ol' Honey-bee?
- Me.

04:01.683 --> 04:03.486
Look, does that sound
like something

04:03.486 --> 04:06.058
you'd wanna do?
- I don't know.

04:06.058 --> 04:07.662
Is it something you'd wanna do?

04:07.662 --> 04:08.764
Well, it's not not something

04:08.764 --> 04:11.102
I wouldn't not think about
not doing.

04:11.102 --> 04:12.337
- Same.
- Oh.

04:12.337 --> 04:14.275
So we're on the same page.

04:14.275 --> 04:16.613
No limits.

04:19.953 --> 04:21.189
Hello, Boring Cat.

04:21.189 --> 04:23.794
Sorry I'm late.
I did not want to come earlier.

04:23.794 --> 04:27.535
- Over here.
- Oh.

04:27.535 --> 04:29.606
Hello, Boring Cat.
- Shh-shh-shh.

04:29.606 --> 04:32.478
I found the perfect bird
for Kevin.

04:32.478 --> 04:35.217
Ugh, no.
Pigeons are first-thought.

04:35.217 --> 04:36.920
Wow, that was
my first thought.

04:36.920 --> 04:40.026
You're good at this.
- I am good at everything.

04:40.026 --> 04:42.264
Especially montages. Hit it!

04:42.264 --> 04:43.767

05:06.312 --> 05:07.849
We're off-leash, baby.

05:07.849 --> 05:09.451
Now that we're not married,

05:09.451 --> 05:11.489
I finish all my statements
with "baby."

05:11.489 --> 05:14.696
Baby.
- Okay, so how do we start?

05:14.696 --> 05:16.633
Just pick a dog
you want to play with

05:16.633 --> 05:18.704
and have more fun
than you've ever had with me.

05:18.704 --> 05:21.944
Well, that'll be easy.

05:21.944 --> 05:25.417
Hey there.
I see you're all by yourself.

05:25.417 --> 05:27.020
Dog parks, huh?

05:27.020 --> 05:28.657
Uh-huh.

05:29.826 --> 05:32.464
Great job, Honey.
"Dog parks, huh?"

05:32.464 --> 05:35.470
Idiot.
- Right-o, right-o, right-o.

05:35.470 --> 05:37.040
Hey, don't worry
about her, man.

05:37.040 --> 05:40.681
A rejection is just someone
not wantin' to be with you.

05:40.681 --> 05:42.986
They call me Flapjack. May I?

05:42.986 --> 05:46.827
Sure. But just so you know,
I'm out of practice.

05:48.263 --> 05:50.066
You don't smell
out of practice.

05:50.066 --> 05:51.168
Wow.

05:51.168 --> 05:52.839
I don't know about all that.

05:52.839 --> 05:54.709
I did take a bath
two months ago.

05:54.709 --> 05:56.680
Uh, may I?
- You wanna sniff it,

05:56.680 --> 05:58.984
you gotta catch it.
Chase me.

06:01.557 --> 06:04.094
Bye, bitch. Whoo-hoo-hoo!

06:07.702 --> 06:11.510
Dude, make a move.
I'm a sure thing.

06:11.510 --> 06:13.479
<i>Sophie, we're gonna be late
for school.</i>

06:13.479 --> 06:14.649
<i>Go get that gerbil!</i>

06:14.649 --> 06:17.354
Oh, no. Already?

06:17.354 --> 06:19.391
I can't go back there.

06:19.391 --> 06:21.362
And I'm a hamster. Do better.

06:27.407 --> 06:31.182
<i>Mom, I can't find Nibbles!</i>

06:31.182 --> 06:32.919
<i>But we can't say
we lost her.</i>

06:32.919 --> 06:35.123
Just stop at the pet store
and get a replacement.

06:35.123 --> 06:36.025
Yes!

06:36.025 --> 06:37.929
<i>Good idea.
They all look alike.</i>

06:37.929 --> 06:39.031
Wow.

06:39.933 --> 06:42.004
<i>And then we played
tug-of-war.</i>

06:42.004 --> 06:42.906
And we wrestled.

06:43.039 --> 06:44.709
And there was this whole thing
with a ball.

06:44.709 --> 06:46.513
And, I mean,
I've chased before,

06:46.513 --> 06:48.784
but I've never played
chase before.

06:48.784 --> 06:50.621
But, okay, I've been going
on and on.

06:50.621 --> 06:51.723
Did you meet anyone?

06:51.723 --> 06:54.529
Actually,
I met this awesome dog

06:54.529 --> 06:57.467
and maybe had
even more fun than you did.

06:57.467 --> 06:59.539
Okay, it's not a competition.

06:59.539 --> 07:01.510
The important thing
is that we had

07:01.510 --> 07:03.847
our own separate
wonderful experiences

07:03.948 --> 07:05.751
with two completely
different dogs.

07:05.751 --> 07:08.657
Right-o, right-o, right-o.

07:08.657 --> 07:10.828
Did somebody order
a stack o' Jack?

07:10.828 --> 07:13.534
Flapjack!
You know Flapjack?

07:13.534 --> 07:15.571
That's the dog
I was telling you about.

07:15.571 --> 07:17.875
That's the dog
you were telling me about?

07:17.976 --> 07:19.178
Yes!

07:19.311 --> 07:20.581
Oh, no.

07:25.190 --> 07:26.860
Surprise!

07:26.860 --> 07:28.764
You two were having
so much fun at the park

07:28.764 --> 07:30.968
with this little guy,
I figured one more dog

07:30.968 --> 07:34.909
might fill the void in my soul.

07:34.909 --> 07:37.582
I didn't realize
you two knew each other.

07:37.582 --> 07:40.020
This is kind of weird
that we both played with you

07:40.020 --> 07:40.955
and had no idea.

07:41.055 --> 07:44.328
And now all three of us
are together... baby.

07:44.328 --> 07:46.298
So how does this work?

07:46.298 --> 07:48.469
Do we take turns
playing with him?

07:48.469 --> 07:50.373
Which one of us
pees on ourself submissively

07:50.373 --> 07:51.743
in a situation like this?

07:51.843 --> 07:55.483
Guys, we don't need to have
our separate fun.

07:55.483 --> 07:59.158
This order of Flapjack
is for the table.

08:00.393 --> 08:03.032
Switch.

08:03.032 --> 08:05.370
Yeah.

08:16.459 --> 08:18.262
Aah!

08:20.367 --> 08:23.373
- Whoa.
- Whoo-hoo.

08:23.373 --> 08:25.043
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:26.278 --> 08:28.483
Mama, it happened again!

08:33.192 --> 08:35.397
Okay, here we go. Day two.

08:35.397 --> 08:37.434
Have you lost weight?

08:37.434 --> 08:39.338
Oh. Well, you look terrible.

08:39.338 --> 08:40.541
Did you sleep last night?

08:40.541 --> 08:42.411
Only for ten hours.

08:42.411 --> 08:44.381
I was tossing and turning
all night.

08:44.381 --> 08:45.718
Even if we do find
the right bird,

08:45.718 --> 08:47.454
I still have to catch it.

08:47.454 --> 08:49.358
It's not gonna just volunteer
to die.

08:49.358 --> 08:52.364
I volunteer to die.

08:52.364 --> 08:53.600
What? Why?

08:53.600 --> 08:55.403
Ever since
my one true love

08:55.403 --> 08:56.773
was ripped from my wings,

08:56.773 --> 09:00.447
I don't want to be
alive anymore.

09:00.447 --> 09:01.550
You heard him.

09:01.550 --> 09:03.821
Chomp down on that dirty bird.

09:06.993 --> 09:09.264
Aah!
- Laundry, laundry, laundry.

09:09.264 --> 09:11.302
All I do is laundry.

09:11.302 --> 09:13.807
I used to be a city planner.

09:13.807 --> 09:16.479
Aah! Oh, my God.
It's that gross gerbil.

09:16.479 --> 09:18.349
Gross hamster!

09:18.349 --> 09:19.586
Aah! Ew, ew.

09:19.586 --> 09:21.556
Oh, God.

09:25.865 --> 09:29.104
Ha, ha. I'm never going
back to that school.

09:29.104 --> 09:30.641
Later, loser.

09:34.481 --> 09:36.118
Oh, nuts.

09:37.789 --> 09:39.626
Ooh, I am Boring Cat.

09:39.626 --> 09:40.795
I say I want to kill bird,

09:40.795 --> 09:42.497
but then I do not kill bird

09:42.497 --> 09:44.736
even though bird
want me to kill bird.

09:44.736 --> 09:46.840
That is Chico.
That's why I do voice.

09:46.840 --> 09:49.579
Tabitha's Chico
makes some good points.

09:49.579 --> 09:51.382
How are we still talking
about this?

09:51.382 --> 09:52.685
It's a bird. Kill it.

09:54.522 --> 09:56.827
Right-o, right-o, right-o.

09:56.927 --> 09:59.231
Aren't we all
just sniffin' along

09:59.231 --> 10:01.102
on our own journeys here?

10:01.102 --> 10:02.070
What?

10:02.070 --> 10:04.609
Maybe if you didn't ask
so many questions,

10:04.609 --> 10:06.680
you wouldn't need
so many answers.

10:06.680 --> 10:08.249
Okay, well,
I think we should show

10:08.249 --> 10:09.418
the bird some grace.

10:09.418 --> 10:10.621
I mean, who are we to decide

10:10.621 --> 10:13.727
who lives and dies,
right, Stan?

10:13.727 --> 10:17.602
Woe! My heart rend in two,
I long for mercy,

10:17.602 --> 10:18.670
a swift death,

10:18.670 --> 10:20.306
for it is in the quietude

10:20.406 --> 10:21.776
of the everlasting slumber--

10:21.776 --> 10:23.379
Oh, my God, I take it back.

10:23.379 --> 10:25.818
Kill the winged rat. Do it now.

10:25.818 --> 10:27.788
Look, just because
you lost your love

10:27.788 --> 10:29.659
doesn't mean you should give up
on life.

10:29.659 --> 10:31.462
Kevin and I thought
we were in love with Dana

10:31.462 --> 10:32.497
until she broke
both our hearts.

10:32.497 --> 10:33.800
And now look at us.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.838
One year later
and happier than ever.

10:35.938 --> 10:38.276
I found my Kevin.
You can too.

10:38.276 --> 10:41.650
Ahh... serum of truth

10:41.650 --> 10:43.486
hitting my ear's taste buds.

10:43.486 --> 10:44.656
I've heard enough.

10:44.756 --> 10:47.260
I shall live
and acquire a new love.

10:48.296 --> 10:49.532
Why, there's one now.

10:49.532 --> 10:52.204
I'm coming to you, beloved.

10:54.576 --> 10:55.911
all: Yeah!

10:55.911 --> 10:59.418
And the crazy carousel
of life continues.

10:59.519 --> 11:00.721
Was Jill painting

11:00.721 --> 11:02.758
in an unventilated room
with you again?

11:02.758 --> 11:03.961
No, no, no.

11:03.961 --> 11:05.731
No, it's just the new dog

11:05.731 --> 11:07.602
Chief and I are playin' with,
Flapjack.

11:07.602 --> 11:09.371
His name's Flapjack.

11:09.371 --> 11:10.808
Flap-jack.

11:10.808 --> 11:12.812
Wait, wait, wait.
The Flapjack?

11:12.812 --> 11:15.083
They say there's no flap
he can't jack.

11:15.083 --> 11:18.022
As someone who's danced
the three-legged tango,

11:18.022 --> 11:20.093
I'm not sure
a couple of vanillas

11:20.093 --> 11:24.234
like you and Chief know
how to travel that rocky road.

11:24.234 --> 11:25.169
Please.

11:25.270 --> 11:27.107
Chief and I have never been
more simpatico.

11:27.107 --> 11:28.877
We're just havin'
some innocent fun.

11:28.877 --> 11:31.048
So much fun, in fact,
that I'm reminded

11:31.048 --> 11:34.689
how little fun
I'm having right now.

11:34.689 --> 11:37.728
Honey-bee gotta fly
like a bird.

11:37.728 --> 11:39.097
But not that bird.

11:39.097 --> 11:41.870
Too soon. No, I dig it.

11:43.807 --> 11:44.976
Well, what are we gonna do?

11:44.976 --> 11:46.846
We can't bring it
back to the school now.

11:46.846 --> 11:48.382
We already gave them
that other one.

11:48.382 --> 11:49.552
Ethan's right.

11:49.552 --> 11:51.088
Just take me back to Sophie.

11:51.088 --> 11:54.596
She's my destiny!

11:57.367 --> 11:58.537
Karma!

12:02.010 --> 12:05.016
What up, dawgz,
with an unconventional Z?

12:05.016 --> 12:06.820
We've had a three-dog day,

12:06.820 --> 12:09.157
what say we have
a three-dog night?

12:09.157 --> 12:11.863
That's what's up
if you two are down.

12:14.001 --> 12:17.274
Well, uh, these ears
ain't gonna lick themselves.

12:18.877 --> 12:21.248
Uh, is this what's up?

12:21.248 --> 12:23.820
I just thought we were gonna
chew on a slipper.

12:23.820 --> 12:26.626
But I'm game if you're game.
Are you game?

12:26.626 --> 12:28.897
Well, I want to
if you want to.

12:28.897 --> 12:30.099
Well, I don't not want to,

12:30.199 --> 12:31.670
if you don't want to
not want to.

12:31.670 --> 12:32.905
If you want not--

12:32.905 --> 12:34.642
Right-o, right-o,
right-o then.

12:34.642 --> 12:36.513
Everyone wants to.

12:37.782 --> 12:40.320
Let Flapjack be your guide.

12:42.959 --> 12:45.363
<i>♪ Right-o, right-o,
right-o ♪</i>

12:46.465 --> 12:47.935
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:47.935 --> 12:50.507
<i>♪ Right-o, right-o, right-o ♪</i>

12:53.647 --> 12:56.686
<i>Somebody order
a stack of Jack?</i>

12:58.489 --> 13:00.561
<i>Everyone wants one.</i>

13:06.840 --> 13:10.246
Right-o, right-o, right-o.

13:16.125 --> 13:18.362
So it looked like
you were having fun last night.

13:18.362 --> 13:21.201
Well, it looked like
you were having fun.

13:21.201 --> 13:22.972
Oh.
I'm surprised you noticed.

13:22.972 --> 13:25.109
You were so deep
in Flapjack's ear.

13:25.109 --> 13:28.215
Well, I was just
in there looking for you.

13:28.215 --> 13:29.084
Really?

13:29.184 --> 13:30.086
Because it seemed like
you were having

13:30.086 --> 13:31.322
a lot of fun with Flapjack--

13:31.322 --> 13:34.027
like more fun
than you ever had with me.

13:34.027 --> 13:35.998
Wasn't that the whole point?

13:35.998 --> 13:38.102
You told me to have fun
without you.

13:38.102 --> 13:40.541
But then I had more fun
without you with you,

13:40.541 --> 13:41.743
so what's the problem?

13:41.743 --> 13:43.847
The problem is,
is that I wanted you

13:43.847 --> 13:45.584
to say that
you couldn't possibly

13:45.584 --> 13:46.853
have more fun without me.

13:46.853 --> 13:48.857
But you didn't,
and now we're in a thruppie!

13:48.857 --> 13:50.894
I thought
that's what you wanted!

13:50.894 --> 13:52.865
That's the last thing
I wanted.

13:52.865 --> 13:54.736
Well, how was I
supposed to know that?

13:54.736 --> 13:56.840
I can't read your butt!

14:08.429 --> 14:10.768
Oh.

14:16.045 --> 14:18.282
You're not from
around here, are you?

14:21.021 --> 14:22.825
You saved my life.

14:22.825 --> 14:24.862
Thank you. I'm Nibbles.

14:24.862 --> 14:26.432
Illinois James.

14:26.432 --> 14:30.039
Are you my new special someone?

14:30.039 --> 14:32.410
Probably. Let's ride.

14:33.847 --> 14:35.316
Whoa!

14:47.775 --> 14:49.177
Chief, I'm sorry.

14:49.177 --> 14:51.081
Elsa got in my head
and made me question

14:51.081 --> 14:52.852
how we define our relationship.

14:52.852 --> 14:54.254
Are we married?
Are we not married?

14:54.254 --> 14:56.158
And if we aren't,
what does that mean?

14:56.158 --> 14:57.828
Will we still be buried
next to each other

14:57.828 --> 14:59.030
in the backyard when we die?

14:59.030 --> 15:00.399
Also, what is death?

15:00.500 --> 15:03.507
I just wanna move forward,
but I don't know how.

15:03.507 --> 15:04.274
Me too.

15:04.274 --> 15:06.211
Are you also
stuck in the wall?

15:06.211 --> 15:08.917
No, I'm-I'm talking
about our relationship.

15:08.917 --> 15:10.821
But have you tried
going backwards?

15:10.821 --> 15:11.856
Yes!

15:11.856 --> 15:14.896
I do want to go backwards
to the way we were,

15:14.896 --> 15:16.331
the dynamic duo--

15:16.331 --> 15:19.204
fighting crime
and looking great in tights.

15:19.204 --> 15:22.578
Yeah, I was actually talking
about the wall this time.

15:22.578 --> 15:25.450
Ow!

15:25.450 --> 15:27.922
So what does this mean?
Are we married?

15:27.922 --> 15:29.992
I don't know,
but we're a pack of two.

15:29.992 --> 15:32.197
And we were happily each
other's favorite playmate

15:32.197 --> 15:33.767
until I created a problem.

15:33.767 --> 15:37.140
And now that problem lives here
and expertly licks our ears.

15:37.140 --> 15:40.814
Don't worry, babe.
I'll get rid of him.

15:40.814 --> 15:41.950
Flapjack.

15:43.954 --> 15:45.356
Honey's got something
to tell you.

15:45.356 --> 15:48.129
I'm sorry,
but this isn't working out.

15:48.129 --> 15:50.534
You're right,
oh, right-o, right-o.

15:50.534 --> 15:53.239
Well, lucky for you,
I know just how to fix it.

15:53.239 --> 15:56.044
Problem was,
you only had one Flapjack.

15:56.044 --> 15:58.850
What you needed
was a whole stack.

16:04.194 --> 16:06.566
♪ Boom-chicka-bow-wow ♪

16:07.735 --> 16:12.243
<i>Bunch of random dogs
convening in the backyard,</i>

16:12.243 --> 16:16.018
<i>licking ears,
it's a regular thing--</i>

16:16.018 --> 16:18.255
<i>not weird at all.</i>

16:18.255 --> 16:21.128
Holy earholes, Batman.
How do we fix this?

16:21.128 --> 16:23.132
Well, Robin,
there's only one way

16:23.132 --> 16:25.002
to scare off these horndogs.

16:26.906 --> 16:29.477
- What the hell was that?
- No idea.

16:29.477 --> 16:30.781

16:37.160 --> 16:39.130
Oh, he's here.

16:39.130 --> 16:41.503
I can't wait for Kevin
to realize I'm worth loving.

16:41.503 --> 16:42.905
Hide.
- Oh, Kevin.

16:42.905 --> 16:44.876
Oh, you're so hot.
You're so hot.

16:44.876 --> 16:46.011
Dana?

16:46.111 --> 16:47.313
Isn't this romantic, babe?

16:47.313 --> 16:49.752
Us getting back together
on our anniversary?

16:49.752 --> 16:52.257
Shh, don't ruin it.

16:52.257 --> 16:55.196
All this anniversary stuff
was for Dana?

16:55.196 --> 16:56.699
It was never about me.

16:56.699 --> 16:58.637
Ooh, plot twist.

16:58.637 --> 16:59.639
Thank God.

17:02.377 --> 17:03.947
Where am I?
What's going on?

17:03.947 --> 17:07.120
Oh, my God, Stan's alive?

17:07.120 --> 17:09.291
Kevin!

17:09.291 --> 17:11.563
Kevin, get it out!
Get it out, Kevin!

17:13.165 --> 17:15.169
What the hell is that?
Oh, my God, oh, my God!

17:15.169 --> 17:17.608
It got in my hair!
Do something!

17:17.608 --> 17:18.977
Oh! Oh, my God!

17:18.977 --> 17:21.583
- Ah! Get it! Get it! Get it!
- Ugh.

17:21.583 --> 17:25.223
My psychic told me you'd never
defend me against a bird.

17:25.223 --> 17:26.559
That is a good psychic.

17:26.559 --> 17:29.565
Second chance
at life--here I come!

17:35.009 --> 17:37.213
Ugh. I ruined everything.

17:37.213 --> 17:39.484
You got him
the perfect gift, Chico.

17:39.484 --> 17:42.958
Sending boho bitch packing,
ultimate twist.

17:42.958 --> 17:44.862
You're right, Tabitha.

17:47.902 --> 17:49.972
You know what, dude?

17:49.972 --> 17:51.743
We're better off without her.

17:51.743 --> 17:53.045
Thanks, buddy.

17:53.045 --> 17:55.082
Not a total waste of day.

17:55.082 --> 17:57.253
Happy ending
for overweight traffic cone,

17:57.353 --> 17:59.625
and bird is finally dead.

18:06.639 --> 18:09.277
This iceberg lettuce
is delicious.

18:09.277 --> 18:11.916
Do you--do you want a bite?
Or--

18:11.916 --> 18:14.588
I'm having the same thing.

18:14.588 --> 18:15.624
Ugh!

18:15.624 --> 18:18.329
I can't do this.
I'm eating in my room tonight.

18:19.732 --> 18:20.734
Knock, knock.

18:20.734 --> 18:22.771
Shel, we have company.

18:22.871 --> 18:24.374
Oh, thank God.

18:24.374 --> 18:27.180
Shel, Darla,
what if I told you

18:27.180 --> 18:29.619
I could spice up
your old, withered sex life?

18:29.619 --> 18:31.823
Unless you're offering
to reignite our passion

18:31.823 --> 18:35.296
with a backyard packed with
horny dogs who can bear witness

18:35.296 --> 18:38.837
to a dual tortoise
taboo-busting erotic carnival,

18:38.837 --> 18:40.540
then we're not interested.

18:44.949 --> 18:46.385
I guess I'm about to embark

18:46.385 --> 18:48.355
on the greatest adventure
of all--

18:48.355 --> 18:50.493
falling in love with you.

18:50.493 --> 18:52.030
Oh, Illinois.

18:56.104 --> 18:57.875
- Ah!
- Sorry!

18:57.875 --> 18:59.477
I'm complicated!

18:59.477 --> 19:03.085
Hawks!
Why'd it have to be hawks?

19:13.707 --> 19:17.313
I guess this is my destiny,
to live alone in a cage

19:17.313 --> 19:20.419
at an underperforming
elementary school.

19:21.989 --> 19:24.227
Oh. You must be my replacement.

19:24.327 --> 19:25.964
I'm 2.0, ho.

19:25.964 --> 19:27.701
They worked out the bugs.

19:27.701 --> 19:29.137
Ooh, spicy.

19:29.137 --> 19:32.210
Maybe you're my new
special someone.

19:32.210 --> 19:34.047
She's going for the face!

19:34.147 --> 19:35.884
Oh, my God,
there's two of them.

19:35.884 --> 19:37.721
We can't keep them both.

19:37.821 --> 19:40.092
I'll take Nibbles!
We have a special bond.

19:40.092 --> 19:41.629
It's happening.

19:41.629 --> 19:45.236
I'm finally getting my original
special someone back!

19:45.236 --> 19:47.373
It's my destiny.

19:47.373 --> 19:48.242
No!

19:48.242 --> 19:50.680
I'm the real Nibbles! Take me!

19:52.216 --> 19:55.423
I'm glad I urinated
in your sock drawer!

19:56.391 --> 19:59.330
Hey, Honey Bunches of Love
and Chief.

19:59.330 --> 20:02.003
Hope you don't mind we started
the party without you.

20:02.003 --> 20:03.105
No, not at all.

20:03.105 --> 20:05.076
We actually brought friends.

20:05.076 --> 20:07.948
Right-o.
Add them to the stack.

20:07.948 --> 20:09.384
Come on, Darla.

20:09.384 --> 20:13.893
Let's teach these doggies
how to do it tortoise style.

20:16.264 --> 20:18.970
Show no mercy.

20:18.970 --> 20:20.372
What's happening?

20:20.372 --> 20:21.743
Choo-choo, Shel.

20:23.011 --> 20:24.982
Oh, no, no, no, no.

20:24.982 --> 20:28.021
- Woo-hoo-hoo!
- Ooh!

20:29.658 --> 20:31.027
My eyes!

20:31.027 --> 20:32.163
Spin me.

20:32.163 --> 20:34.167
Oh, well, that ain't right.

20:34.167 --> 20:36.338
Oh, Shel and Darla are back!

20:36.338 --> 20:38.375
- That was disgusting.
- So gross!

20:38.475 --> 20:41.214
Why do I always end up
in the splash zone?

20:41.214 --> 20:44.655
Well, folks,
this Jack has been flapped.

20:44.655 --> 20:46.993
I think I'm gonna
go away for a while.

20:46.993 --> 20:49.532
Chief, he's gone. We did it!

20:49.532 --> 20:51.134
And they're still doing it.

20:51.134 --> 20:53.640
We might have to move.
- Chupacabra!

20:56.478 --> 20:57.514
I know we rescued him,

20:57.514 --> 21:00.252
but it feels like
he rescued us.

21:00.252 --> 21:02.457
I know. You keep saying that.

21:02.457 --> 21:04.595
Oh, look at him
having a sweet dream.

21:04.595 --> 21:06.398
He's probably
running in a meadow

21:06.398 --> 21:08.335
or frolicking on the seashore.

21:13.178 --> 21:17.019
Come join us, tortoise style.

21:18.388 --> 21:21.027
Munch on my lettuce.

21:22.998 --> 21:24.902
No, no.

21:24.902 --> 21:28.442
Help me. Someone help me!

21:28.442 --> 21:29.879
Should we wake him up?

21:29.879 --> 21:31.849
No. Let him sleep.

21:36.592 --> 21:37.861
That's nice, Jen and Gabby.
