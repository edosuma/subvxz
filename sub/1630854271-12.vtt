00:05.005 --> 00:08.967
Daly: Tonight,
the final night of battles...

00:09.009 --> 00:10.385
Gwen: Wow.
Yay!

00:10.427 --> 00:12.345
So far,
battles are riveting.
I love you.

00:12.387 --> 00:15.348
I have a lot of young artists
on my team this season.
Sing, girl!

00:15.390 --> 00:17.726
And you can see
how much they want it.
Yes!

00:17.767 --> 00:19.686
It's always super inspiring.
Daly: Congratulations.

00:19.728 --> 00:21.521
Gwen:
This is everything to them.

00:21.563 --> 00:22.897
Oh, my God.
I love you, I love you,
I love you.

00:22.939 --> 00:23.898
They're so cute!

00:23.940 --> 00:25.650
[ Whoosh ]
Yay!

00:25.692 --> 00:27.694
Daly: That's the sound
of a steal times two!
Two times.

00:27.736 --> 00:30.780
So much fun!
Camila: I'm so proud
of Team Camila so far.

00:30.822 --> 00:32.949
Great job, bro.
I feel like I have
so much talent on my team.

00:32.991 --> 00:34.451
Camila, wow.

00:34.492 --> 00:36.411
I know!

00:36.453 --> 00:38.038
And I still feel like
they haven't even scratched...

00:38.079 --> 00:39.414
Bye.
...their potential.

00:39.456 --> 00:42.375
Still in the game, baby!
Whoo!

00:42.417 --> 00:44.002
Blake: I haven't used
my save yet.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.879
I definitely want to have
the artists that I feel like

00:45.920 --> 00:48.506
are ready for this competition.
Come on, Bodie!

00:48.548 --> 00:50.967
This year, we're doing
three-way knockouts.

00:51.009 --> 00:52.385
Thank you very much.

00:52.427 --> 00:53.887
Every time I think
we've thought of every way

00:53.928 --> 00:57.057
to throw something crazy
at these contestants,

00:57.098 --> 00:58.266
I'm proven wrong.

00:58.308 --> 01:00.226
Hey!
How we doing, guys?
Ah!

01:00.268 --> 01:02.187
Oh, my gosh.
Blake: It'd be one thing if
you got to select two winners,

01:02.228 --> 01:04.731
but we only get one person
out of three.
Hey.
Hey.

01:04.773 --> 01:06.816
That's going to be nuts.

01:06.858 --> 01:08.360
Whoa!

01:08.401 --> 01:10.236
John: This has been a really fun
season so far.

01:10.278 --> 01:12.322
Team Legend is looking so good.
Whoo!

01:12.364 --> 01:14.699
I'll put my best artists
against anybody else.

01:14.741 --> 01:15.909
We're ready to go.

01:15.950 --> 01:17.744
Team Legend's ready to win.

01:17.786 --> 01:20.080
**

01:20.121 --> 01:22.248
So, Jazmine,
I need you to tell me

01:22.290 --> 01:24.125
what you think
about Team Legend.

01:24.167 --> 01:25.794
Team Legend is amazing.

01:25.835 --> 01:28.088
It's a different
array of singers.
Yeah.

01:28.129 --> 01:30.340
That's what makes it legendary.
[ Laughs ]

01:30.382 --> 01:32.717
Yeah, it's legendary.
And they're all really good.

01:32.759 --> 01:33.927
Yeah.
And they are all

01:33.968 --> 01:34.969
very excited to see you.

01:35.011 --> 01:36.262
Thanks. [ Laughs ]

01:36.304 --> 01:38.390
Well, we've got
Omar and Lana.

01:38.431 --> 01:41.434
John: I love Lana's voice --
it's powerful, piercing.

01:41.476 --> 01:43.019
I think it's really great.

01:43.061 --> 01:45.522
Omar, like, his voice
is otherworldly.
Daly: Four chairs!

01:45.563 --> 01:47.107
Crazy that we
didn't know each other...
This is crazy.

01:47.148 --> 01:48.775
...literally
a couple of days ago.

01:48.817 --> 01:50.402
I know.
And now we're doing this.

01:50.443 --> 01:52.404
Best friends?
Be-- [ Laughs ]

01:52.445 --> 01:53.780
Team Legend.
Bring it on.

01:53.822 --> 01:55.073
Let's go!

01:55.115 --> 01:56.866
Hello!
Yes. Yes!
Yay!

01:56.908 --> 01:59.494
The great
Jazmine Sullivan is here.
Oh, my gosh!

01:59.536 --> 02:01.746
Aahhhh!

02:01.788 --> 02:03.790
Hit that note! [ Laughs ]
Oh, my God!

02:03.832 --> 02:06.292
Omar: So I walk in,
I saw Jazmine Sullivan.

02:06.334 --> 02:09.212
Literally, all I could do was...
"Aahhhh!"

02:09.254 --> 02:11.423
It's so surreal
to see someone

02:11.464 --> 02:13.508
you've respected
for so many years.

02:13.550 --> 02:14.718
Wow, your --
Nice to meet you.

02:14.759 --> 02:16.302
This is gonna be fun.
Queen energy.

02:16.344 --> 02:18.221
Lana:
She's won two Grammys,

02:18.263 --> 02:20.306
has multiple hit singles,

02:20.348 --> 02:22.642
and I'm kind of fangirling
over here.

02:22.684 --> 02:25.603
They're gonna sing
some "Frozen" -- "Frozen II."

02:25.645 --> 02:26.813
[ Exhales deeply ]
Incredible.

02:26.855 --> 02:29.315
As a father
of a 6-year-old girl,

02:29.357 --> 02:30.483
I'm very familiar.

02:30.525 --> 02:31.985
This one's a classic...
Yeah.

02:32.027 --> 02:33.737
..."Into the Unknown."

02:33.778 --> 02:36.156
So there's the original version,
which is Idina Menzel.
Okay.

02:36.197 --> 02:37.657
But then Panic! At The Disco

02:37.699 --> 02:39.784
did, like, a modern
rock version of it.
Okay.

02:39.826 --> 02:44.497
John: I thought with
a kind of '80s rock singer

02:44.539 --> 02:47.167
and a pop singer,
both with a little experience,

02:47.208 --> 02:49.252
thought it'd be cool
to have them

02:49.294 --> 02:52.547
singing this rock-pop
classic.

02:52.589 --> 02:55.008
John: Have you sung this song
before, either of you?

02:55.050 --> 02:56.718
Oh, you work in Orlando --
do you --
I do.

02:56.760 --> 02:58.845
You work at some of the --
the theme parks, too, right?

02:58.887 --> 03:01.097
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
my band does a lot of events.

03:01.139 --> 03:02.766
I work for
an entertainment company.

03:02.807 --> 03:05.769
I've sung in a lot
of theme parks around the world.

03:05.810 --> 03:07.479
I sing with
my own personal band.

03:07.520 --> 03:09.272
Been doing it
for 15 years now.

03:09.314 --> 03:12.567
* If we can't go on *

03:12.609 --> 03:14.986
* To survive the tide *

03:15.028 --> 03:18.615
* Love divides *
Sing!

03:18.656 --> 03:22.452
The first time
I learned a song in harmony

03:22.494 --> 03:24.079
was with my family.

03:24.120 --> 03:25.497
You know,
as the younger brother,

03:25.538 --> 03:27.207
I grew up playing baseball.

03:27.248 --> 03:29.209
My brother and my sister
were in music.

03:29.250 --> 03:31.002
And then, once I found singing,

03:31.044 --> 03:34.297
I felt like that was such
a big part of who I am.

03:34.339 --> 03:37.884
Graduating high school and going
right into the music industry,

03:37.926 --> 03:42.055
I live for a dream
of doing more.

03:42.097 --> 03:44.140
Now, being on "The Voice,"

03:44.182 --> 03:47.227
I think John's gonna help me
step into a new realm.
Welcome. Welcome, brother.

03:47.268 --> 03:48.978
And we're going
for that trophy, baby.

03:49.020 --> 03:50.605
We're going for it.

03:50.647 --> 03:54.859
* Oo-oo *
* Into the unknown *

03:54.901 --> 03:58.279
* Into the unknown *

03:58.321 --> 04:00.573
Jazmine: Team Legend is amazing,
especially on this song...
* Into the unknown *

04:00.615 --> 04:04.494
because it's definitely
a battle of the performers.
* Ah, ah, ah, ah *

04:04.536 --> 04:06.079
* Ah-ah, ah-ah *
Omar, when he was rehearsing,

04:06.121 --> 04:07.288
he, like, did the same run
exactly the same each time.

04:07.330 --> 04:08.957
* Into the unknown *

04:08.998 --> 04:11.418
And I was like,
"Is he gonna mess up at all?"
Whoo!

04:11.459 --> 04:13.086
* Ah-ah, ah-ah *
* Ah-ah, ah-ah *

04:13.128 --> 04:15.797
He didn't mess up.
[ Laughs ]
* Ah-ah, ah-ah *

04:15.839 --> 04:17.757
And he sings it
technically well.
* Ah-ah, ah-ah *

04:17.799 --> 04:20.593
To me, he's one
of the biggest threats.
* Ah-ah, ah-ah *

04:20.635 --> 04:24.097
* Oh-oh, oh-oh *
* Ah-ah, ah-ah *

04:24.139 --> 04:26.141
John: Lana has this...
* Where are you going? *

04:26.182 --> 04:28.268
...musical theater energy.
* Don't leave me alone *

04:28.309 --> 04:32.272
* How do I follow you... *

04:32.313 --> 04:35.483
She loves the theatrics,
the drama of it.

04:35.525 --> 04:37.986
You know,
she just has that passion.

04:38.028 --> 04:40.363
Whoo!
Beautiful!

04:40.405 --> 04:41.948
Whoo!
Cool.

04:41.990 --> 04:43.616
My Lord,
y'all sound great.
Mm!

04:43.658 --> 04:45.827
But, y'all,
there's a couple of times

04:45.869 --> 04:47.829
when I don't think
you should harmonize.

04:47.871 --> 04:49.247
Okay.
Sometimes less is more.

04:49.289 --> 04:50.457
Yeah.
Less is more.

04:50.498 --> 04:51.958
One is I don't think

04:52.000 --> 04:54.544
you should sing the "oh-oh"
together on the intro.

04:54.586 --> 04:56.713
I think Lana should do it,
so...
Okay.

04:56.755 --> 04:59.007
* Into the unknown,
into the unknown *

04:59.049 --> 05:01.134
* Into the unkno-o-own *
* Oh-oh *

05:01.176 --> 05:02.844
Cool.

05:02.886 --> 05:04.721
Everyone feeling good?
I'm here for emotional support.

05:04.763 --> 05:07.766
[ Laughter ]
Sorry.

05:07.807 --> 05:10.268
I started going into
choir director mode.

05:10.310 --> 05:11.770
You guys got this.

05:11.811 --> 05:14.647
Khhht! Khhht!
Waah! Ha ha!
Yeah!

05:14.689 --> 05:16.399
Show -- Show out.
Alright, we're ready.

05:16.441 --> 05:18.151
Show out.

05:18.193 --> 05:19.694
* Oo-oo, oo-oo *

05:19.736 --> 05:21.738
Lana: Omar is amazing.

05:21.780 --> 05:25.325
But I've been doing theater
since I was yea big.

05:25.367 --> 05:26.993
When I step out onstage,

05:27.035 --> 05:31.498
I feel like
I'm 10 times the size that I am.

05:31.539 --> 05:36.836
* I'm missing you like candy *

05:36.878 --> 05:40.256
I definitely think I'm paired
with the right coach

05:40.298 --> 05:41.675
for this moment.
* Ahhh *

05:41.716 --> 05:44.010
John, I mean, he has an EGOT,

05:44.052 --> 05:47.013
so [Laughs]
I'm just hoping that

05:47.055 --> 05:49.974
he can share
some of his wisdom...
Thank you, John.

05:50.016 --> 05:52.102
...and I'll be able
to channel it.

05:52.143 --> 05:59.275
* Into the unknown *

05:59.317 --> 06:02.445
[ Laughs ] Just make sure
y'all are looking at each other

06:02.487 --> 06:03.905
at the same time.

06:03.947 --> 06:05.824
Sorry, I didn't look at you
at all during that last one.

06:05.865 --> 06:08.535
Yes, just feed off
each other's energy.

06:08.576 --> 06:11.663
I go based off
of feeling and gut,

06:11.705 --> 06:14.874
and Omar
is just, like, technique.

06:14.916 --> 06:19.713
So we have totally different
ways of approaching music.

06:19.754 --> 06:23.633
So may the best man win --
or woman.

06:23.675 --> 06:25.552
Thank you guys so much.
John: Great to see you guys.

06:25.593 --> 06:26.845
You sound incredible.
Appreciate it.

06:26.886 --> 06:28.304
You're --
You're just ridiculous.

06:28.346 --> 06:29.472
Omar's a four-chair turn.

06:29.514 --> 06:32.017
These shoes are crazy.
They hurt, girl.

06:32.058 --> 06:33.893
But Lana is no slouch.

06:33.935 --> 06:35.520
She is coming with...
So great.

06:35.562 --> 06:37.731
...full passion.
I just love your energy.

06:37.772 --> 06:40.066
Lana's up to the challenge.
She's ready.

06:40.108 --> 06:42.068
So this is gonna be tough.

epic battle performances.

Alright, alright, alright.
I just want to feel
a little bit more of what --

07:05.467 --> 07:06.926
Like, more of the energy
of the song.

07:06.968 --> 07:08.928
When you do the super high thing
on the last chorus,

07:08.970 --> 07:11.222
full voice
is more powerful.

07:11.264 --> 07:14.809
* It's where I found Jesus *

07:14.851 --> 07:17.145
* Where I wrecked

both perform it,

17:40.185 --> 17:43.438
you seemed to care more about,
like, hitting every note

17:43.480 --> 17:47.484
when it's really about
the emotional sentiment

17:47.525 --> 17:49.444
that's attached
to all this melodic stuff.

17:49.486 --> 17:52.072
I just want to feel
a little bit more of what --

17:52.113 --> 17:53.365
Like, more of the energy
of the song.

17:53.406 --> 17:54.866
You just kind of have
to showcase

17:54.908 --> 17:57.452
what you're internally feeling
without telling us.

17:57.494 --> 17:59.162
You tell us with the --
the music

17:59.204 --> 18:00.538
and the band
that's behind you.

18:00.580 --> 18:03.875
Let's try and find an intention
for the song.

18:03.917 --> 18:07.962
Does this song feel more happy
to you or more sad to you?

18:08.004 --> 18:09.255
It feels more sad to me.

18:09.297 --> 18:10.548
I think sad, as well.

18:10.590 --> 18:12.092
You should run with that.

18:12.133 --> 18:14.219
Zach: This song does take me
back to my childhood.

18:14.260 --> 18:15.762
It wasn't the best situation.

18:15.804 --> 18:18.223
When I was in seventh grade,
my parents got divorced.

18:18.264 --> 18:21.184
I'd always go to my room,
and I'd sit down at the piano,

18:21.226 --> 18:22.811
rather than, like,

18:22.852 --> 18:25.063
sitting there crying about it or
trying to release it that way.

18:25.105 --> 18:28.400
The best way for me was to just
write about what's on my mind.

18:28.441 --> 18:30.068
For me to win
this battle round,

18:30.110 --> 18:31.778
I think I need to make sure that
I stay connected to the song.

18:31.820 --> 18:35.198
Think about who do you love
the most in the world?

18:35.240 --> 18:37.575
Andrew: The song makes me think
about my entire family, really,

18:37.617 --> 18:39.953
because we always used to listen
to Whitney's greatest hits

18:39.994 --> 18:43.748
during, like, holidays and
just us cooking and having fun.

18:43.790 --> 18:47.877
My parents had to fight
tooth and nail as immigrants.

18:47.919 --> 18:51.339
They provided me with this life
and this possibility to pursue

18:51.381 --> 18:55.176
whatever I want to pursue,
so I-I don't want to waste it.

18:55.218 --> 18:56.678
Andrew, what's helped me

18:56.720 --> 18:59.014
with my performance anxiety
or -- or nerves --

18:59.055 --> 19:02.392
I remember when I sang this song
at the Grammys for my dad,

19:02.434 --> 19:04.561
and it was just the most
intimidating crowd ever.

19:04.602 --> 19:06.688
It's scary,
but I remember being like,

19:06.730 --> 19:09.441
"You know what?
More important than anybody here

19:09.482 --> 19:10.817
that I'm trying to impress

19:10.859 --> 19:13.945
is what an amazing dad
my dad has been to me,

19:13.987 --> 19:15.697
so I'm just gonna focus
on him."

19:15.739 --> 19:17.574
And anytime I get
a little thought like,

19:17.615 --> 19:18.992
"Oh my God,
what if I forget the words?"

19:19.034 --> 19:21.953
I want to be like,
"Camila, who cares?"

19:21.995 --> 19:23.621
Andrew: I'm self-taught
for the most part.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.790
I haven't really taken
that many vocal lessons.

19:25.832 --> 19:28.585
So I was feeling nerves,
and that was making me tense.

19:28.626 --> 19:30.295
But talking to Camila --

19:30.337 --> 19:31.546
she's really
helping me understand

19:31.588 --> 19:32.964
how to be in the moment

19:33.006 --> 19:35.925
instead of being
too over-critical of my voice,

19:35.967 --> 19:37.427
and it's really helpful.

19:37.469 --> 19:38.762
You just got to own it.
Yeah.

19:38.803 --> 19:40.430
Even if you go off-pitch
a little.

19:40.472 --> 19:41.806
It doesn't matter.
Who cares? Just own it.

19:41.848 --> 19:43.975
Stevie Nicks, Bonnie Raitt --
all the greats --

19:44.017 --> 19:45.602
never were unbelievably
pitch-perfect.

19:45.643 --> 19:47.187
You're not a robot.
You're not a robot.

19:47.228 --> 19:51.066
It's not gonna be human
if it's perceived as perfect.

19:51.107 --> 19:55.445
* Oh, I wanna dance
with somebody *

19:55.487 --> 19:58.740
* I wanna feel the heat

19:58.782 --> 20:01.159
Camila: In this battle,
I'm looking for growth.
Whoo!

20:01.201 --> 20:03.244
It doesn't have to be perfect,
doesn't have to be flawless,

20:03.286 --> 20:06.039
doesn't have to be
the most technically perfect

20:06.081 --> 20:07.499
vocal performance ever,

20:07.540 --> 20:09.626
but I want to see, like,
star power.

20:09.668 --> 20:14.422
* With somebody who loves me *

20:14.464 --> 20:16.257
That ending.
That was way better.

20:16.299 --> 20:17.884
That is lit.
I'm gonna toss this
right here.

20:17.926 --> 20:20.887
How do you feel?
I feel okay.

20:20.929 --> 20:22.847
Why just okay?
'Cause I feel like
I could've done better.

20:22.889 --> 20:24.891
What?
You're lit, bro.
Thank you so much.

20:24.933 --> 20:26.601
I appreciate that.
I think that you're being
too hard on yourself.

20:26.643 --> 20:28.186
I'm very hypercritical.
I'm very hypercritical, too.

20:28.228 --> 20:29.979
Just look at the audience.
I'm very hypercritical.

20:30.021 --> 20:32.273
It's gonna make a -- a lot
of -- of big, big difference.

20:32.315 --> 20:34.776
What should I do?
Here's the thing --
you have to remind yourself,

20:34.818 --> 20:37.821
"I don't have to be perfect.
I will probably mess up.

20:37.862 --> 20:40.407
Why? Because I'm human,
and that's normal."

20:40.448 --> 20:42.367
Andrew was being so hard
on himself,

20:42.409 --> 20:44.911
but once he realizes...
'Cause you're
already 200%...

20:44.953 --> 20:47.288
...how special
and how gifted he is...
...everybody else.

20:47.330 --> 20:49.207
...he is going to,
like, really fly.

20:49.249 --> 20:52.293
Don't worry about the nerves,
bro, you're good.

20:52.335 --> 20:53.545
I'm trying.
I shook him.

20:53.586 --> 20:55.046
I tried to get
the nerves out of him.

20:55.088 --> 20:56.589
They're coming out.
He got like half of them.

20:56.631 --> 20:58.216
Shake me, like,
I need it more than he does.

20:58.258 --> 20:59.759
We're doing the same thing.
I'll shake you, too, bro.

20:59.801 --> 21:01.928
I think the person that connects
with the message

21:01.970 --> 21:04.639
is going to ultimately connect
the most with Camila.

21:04.681 --> 21:06.391
All right, y'all.
Thank you.

a really hard decision.

Oh, my gosh.

24:19.834 --> 24:22.087
Zach, your voice
really shined.

24:22.128 --> 24:24.798
It was like
an alternative-sounding voice

24:24.839 --> 24:26.466
in a pop song.
Yeah.

24:26.508 --> 24:28.134
I like the contrast
of that.

Andrew, what I love
about your voice

is some of the unexpected
runs that you do.

about Andrew --

24:44.150 --> 24:46.569
you do a lot of unexpected
things as a vocalist,

24:46.611 --> 24:48.029
and I think that's
very cool.

24:48.071 --> 24:50.323
You have an interesting
approach to music,

more consistently on point.

an opportunity

they just didn't quite land.

you're better than --

25:10.218 --> 25:12.012
than what happened here
today.

Zach, you were both kind of
handed a -- a tall task here,

25:16.016 --> 25:17.600
but that's what I love
about the battle rounds

25:17.642 --> 25:20.854
is when you are handed something
that's almost impossible to do

25:20.895 --> 25:22.522
and you figure out
how to make it work.

25:22.564 --> 25:25.400

he came through the best

25:25.442 --> 25:28.486

27:33.903 --> 27:36.031
I wish I had another save.
Thank you.

27:36.072 --> 27:38.116
It's just hard
to see people go home.

27:38.158 --> 27:39.409
Great job, Zach.

27:39.451 --> 27:42.871
But it's so cool
to see these performances,

27:42.912 --> 27:44.873
to see all this talent,

27:44.914 --> 27:46.624
and to be surprised.

this magical star quality.

with Chello.

28:09.105 --> 28:11.358

Chello!

28:11.399 --> 28:12.901
John: There are underdogs
and favorites,

28:12.942 --> 28:16.029
but sometimes, the performances
say something else,

28:16.071 --> 28:18.239
and you've got to go
with your heart.

28:18.281 --> 28:23.161

things new *

Peyton, your voice

28:31.169 --> 28:33.046
has an edge
and a power to it.

28:33.088 --> 28:34.255
I appreciate that.
Thank you.

The winner of
this battle is Peyton.

28:36.132 --> 28:38.635

Peyton, congratulations!

28:38.677 --> 28:40.136
Gwen: I think Peyton has a lot
of potential.

28:40.178 --> 28:42.472
He has a really big voice
and a big range.

28:42.514 --> 28:43.682
Great job.

28:43.723 --> 28:45.350
The performances so far

28:45.392 --> 28:47.060
have been
kind of mind-blowing.

28:47.102 --> 28:48.812
I haven't been here for a while,

28:48.853 --> 28:51.272
so I feel like they're
even better than I remember.
Whoo!

28:51.314 --> 28:58.113
* I would give
everything I own *

28:58.154 --> 29:00.949
* Just to have you *

29:00.990 --> 29:04.160
* Back again *

29:04.202 --> 29:06.663
Your voice is such
a storytelling voice.

29:06.705 --> 29:08.498
It's so personal to you.

29:08.540 --> 29:11.001
I'm gonna say that Kayla
won this -- this battle.
Thank you so much.

29:11.042 --> 29:12.794
Daly:
Kayla, congratulations.

29:12.836 --> 29:14.129
You're moving on
to the knockouts,

29:14.170 --> 29:15.964

<i>Stand by.</i>

29:19.342 --> 29:21.386
The pressure's on,
Blake Shelton.

29:21.428 --> 29:22.178
Yep.

29:22.220 --> 29:23.930
So how about the trio, guys?

29:23.972 --> 29:26.141
Yeah.
I know. How do -- How do you
feel singing with a duo?

29:26.182 --> 29:27.142
Is it weird?
Are you cool with it?

29:27.183 --> 29:28.518
It's -- It's so incredible.

29:28.560 --> 29:31.104
It's just that
our sound is so unique.

29:31.146 --> 29:32.731
All right, these are
always tough to me

29:32.772 --> 29:36.651
because you have a solo artist
to go against a duo.
Mm-hmm.

29:36.693 --> 29:38.987
Yeah.
Both of these artists
are country.

29:39.029 --> 29:40.572
I mean, The Dryes
probably go

29:40.613 --> 29:42.115
a couple
of different directions.
Yeah, I know.

29:42.157 --> 29:44.117
It's not --
It's not The Wets...

29:44.159 --> 29:45.994
It's The Dryes.
It's The Dryes.

29:46.036 --> 29:47.912
That'd be embarrassing
if you said it the wrong way.
Not The Wets.

29:47.954 --> 29:49.414
Yeah, The Wet--
[ Chuckles ]

29:49.456 --> 29:51.249
Here they come.
Coming in hot.
Ah. Yeah!

29:51.291 --> 29:53.043
Y'all come meet my buddy,
Jimmie Allen.
So, how y'all doing, man?

29:53.084 --> 29:54.586
What's up, man?
How you doing, bro?
What's up?

29:54.627 --> 29:56.421
So, Jimmie --
Jimmie Allen's here today,

29:56.463 --> 29:58.673
and it's just such an honor
to be in the presence of him.

29:58.715 --> 30:00.675
How are you? I'm Jimmie,
good to meet you...
Hi, nice to meet you.

30:00.717 --> 30:02.719
I'm gonna give you a hug.
...as well, come on in.

30:02.761 --> 30:04.429
Nice to meet you.
Shaking Jimmie Allen's hand
reminded me of, like,

30:04.471 --> 30:06.473
what it takes to be
an independent artist.

30:06.514 --> 30:08.683
With us living in Nashville,
it's been a long road,

30:08.725 --> 30:11.311
but someone like Jimmie
and many others before us

30:11.353 --> 30:13.521
have really
paved the way.

30:13.563 --> 30:15.190
You all live
in Nashville, right?
We do, mm-hmm.

30:15.231 --> 30:16.858
Y'all been gigging
any or what?

30:16.900 --> 30:18.526
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah, we did a few shows
while we were home.

30:18.568 --> 30:20.320
Jimmie: Nice.
We did one
at 3rd & Lindsley.

30:20.362 --> 30:21.905
Derek: Some writers rounds.
So...
Love that.

30:21.946 --> 30:23.281
We'll hang out at Robert's
or something.
Nice.

30:23.323 --> 30:24.532
Yeah.
I love Robert's.

30:24.574 --> 30:25.909
What about Ole Red,
for God's sakes?

30:25.950 --> 30:27.410
We do! We do!
I was milking it.

30:27.452 --> 30:28.620
Ain't nobody missing Ole Red.
I was waiting on it.

30:28.661 --> 30:30.497
I was milking it.
Oh, my God.

30:30.538 --> 30:32.499
* Islands in the stream *

30:32.540 --> 30:35.168
* That is what we are *

30:35.210 --> 30:37.212
* No on in between *

30:37.253 --> 30:38.797
How long have you guys
been married?

30:38.838 --> 30:40.048
10 years in November.

30:40.090 --> 30:42.217
There's no better way
to duet

30:42.258 --> 30:44.552
than if you're
doing et.

30:44.594 --> 30:46.388
"Doing et."
Oh, my God.
And so -- And so...

30:46.429 --> 30:47.681
We're going
to go with Blake.

30:47.722 --> 30:48.973
Alright!

30:49.015 --> 30:50.183
Where do you live now?

30:50.225 --> 30:52.018
I live
in Statesboro, Georgia.

30:52.060 --> 30:54.562
College town.
Yeah.

30:54.604 --> 30:57.232
Bryce: Going to college,
I went for a degree in business

30:57.273 --> 30:58.900
and fell
in love with music there.

30:58.942 --> 31:03.238
I went from showing up to open
mic nights to booking shows,

31:03.279 --> 31:06.032
playing in front of 100 people
to 1,500 people

31:06.074 --> 31:09.077
to selling out my first concert.

31:09.119 --> 31:11.079
I'm small-town famous, maybe.

31:11.121 --> 31:12.414
Maybe on a good day.

31:17.460 --> 31:21.840
* Don't I matter anymore? *

31:21.881 --> 31:23.299
Man, I was blown away.

31:23.341 --> 31:27.137
And what a great country name.
Leather...wood.

31:27.178 --> 31:28.722
My man!
Shake your hand.

31:28.763 --> 31:30.598
I'm trying to take my talents
from Statesboro, Georgia,

31:30.640 --> 31:33.685
all the way here to L.A. and
show "The Voice" what I can do.

31:33.727 --> 31:37.188
* I was raised off
of Rural Route 3 *

31:37.230 --> 31:38.773
* Out past where
the blacktop ends *
Blake: I gave these guys
"Red Dirt Road"

31:38.815 --> 31:41.818
because it's a great song
for a duo, obviously,

31:41.860 --> 31:45.405
but the message of it
is just so, so country.

31:45.447 --> 31:48.199
Bryce has got that cowboy
George Strait thing about him

31:48.241 --> 31:52.120
that I knew they would all have
a great time singing this thing.

31:52.162 --> 31:54.789
* I learned
the path to heaven *

31:54.831 --> 31:58.084
* Is full of sinners
and believers *

31:58.126 --> 32:03.214
I love just that raw Georgia
country in Bryce's voice.

32:03.256 --> 32:06.634
* Down that red dirt road *

32:06.676 --> 32:10.305
* It's where I drank
my first beer *

32:10.347 --> 32:13.391
* It's where I found Jesus *

32:13.433 --> 32:14.684
Katelyn's killing it.

32:14.726 --> 32:16.561
And Derek,
he's got a really good tone

32:16.603 --> 32:18.938
that actually fits really well
with his wife.

32:18.980 --> 32:21.691
* Of that red dirt road *

32:21.733 --> 32:23.318
Bryce: Well, after hearing
The Dryes singing,

32:23.360 --> 32:24.652
you know,
I am intimidated by them.

32:24.694 --> 32:27.113
by the soulful harmonies
that they have --

32:27.155 --> 32:28.281
something I'd never done.

32:28.323 --> 32:29.574
It's gonna be
a hard struggle,

32:29.616 --> 32:31.076
but I couldn't be
more blessed to be here.

32:31.117 --> 32:32.285
That's a cool arrangement.

32:32.327 --> 32:33.536
Oh, yeah.
Thank y'all.

32:33.578 --> 32:35.163
This sounds real good, man.

32:35.205 --> 32:37.040
The main thing to work on
is just the three-part harmony.

32:37.082 --> 32:39.459
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Just tightening that up,
you know.

32:39.501 --> 32:41.920
Everybody's kind of trickling
off at different places.

32:41.961 --> 32:44.339
You guys probably aren't
because it's automatic to you,

32:44.381 --> 32:47.801
but Bryce is trying to figure
out how to be in a trio now.
Katelyn: Totally.

32:47.842 --> 32:50.345
[ Laughs ] Right, yeah.
Solo artist, you know.

32:50.387 --> 32:52.389
Bryce definitely
has a plateful.

32:52.430 --> 32:53.765
He's trying to quickly learn

32:53.807 --> 32:55.684
how to blend
with these other two singers.

32:55.725 --> 32:58.436
And -- And he definitely has
the biggest challenge.

32:58.478 --> 33:00.355
You're the only
female voice in it,

33:00.397 --> 33:02.190
so you really kind of
got to drive this thing.

33:02.232 --> 33:04.442
Totally.
'Cause when you came in
the beginning, you're strong.

33:04.484 --> 33:05.735
Yeah.
When you came in
kind of after

33:05.777 --> 33:08.238
the guys started singing,
it wasn't as...

33:08.279 --> 33:09.364
Yeah.
...powerful.

33:09.406 --> 33:10.740
Like, still bring it.

33:10.782 --> 33:12.534
This song is
so special to us.

33:12.575 --> 33:14.911
You know, the song talks about
where I first saw Mary,

33:14.953 --> 33:16.204
where I drank my first beer,

33:16.246 --> 33:18.373
where I found Jesus and --
A lot of firsts.

33:18.415 --> 33:19.791
I mean, it kind of reminded me
of us 'cause, like,

33:19.833 --> 33:22.210
we moved to Nashville,
and we have a house now,

33:22.252 --> 33:23.920
and we're planting
our own roots

33:23.962 --> 33:27.048
and our own firsts
in -- in Nashville.
Mm-hmm.

33:27.090 --> 33:30.552
* It's where I found Jesus *

33:30.593 --> 33:32.887
Just to think about
our growth as a couple

33:32.929 --> 33:35.390
and, also, like,
our music career.

33:35.432 --> 33:37.350
We're gonna be doing music
in some facet

33:37.392 --> 33:38.893
for the rest
of our lives...
Yeah.

33:38.935 --> 33:41.438
...whether we have kids
next year

33:41.479 --> 33:43.606
or five years from now
or whatever,

33:43.648 --> 33:46.484
and wherever that --
those two roads lead,

33:46.526 --> 33:48.778
I just know that we're gonna
get through it together.

33:48.820 --> 33:51.406
When you do the super high thing
on the last chorus,

33:51.448 --> 33:53.283
full voice
is more powerful.
Yeah.

33:53.324 --> 33:54.993
Like, the song
has built to that.

33:55.035 --> 33:56.202
Yeah.
Yeah.

33:56.244 --> 33:58.663
* It's where I found Jesus *

33:58.705 --> 34:00.248
Stay up there.
Okay, cool.

34:00.290 --> 34:01.750
I-I think it'll be --
All right.

34:01.791 --> 34:03.251
Sounds really good.
[ Singing indistinctly ]

34:03.293 --> 34:04.836
The thing I feel
about country music, man,

34:04.878 --> 34:06.838
what gives us an advantage is,
a lot of times, you know,

34:06.880 --> 34:09.924
we have songs that connect with
our listeners on a deeper level.

34:09.966 --> 34:12.552
I think that was a great
song choice for them.

34:12.594 --> 34:13.970
Just gotta wait
for lights, camera, action,

34:14.012 --> 34:17.682
and...see who shows up.

finally caught up.

the drums.
Yeah, hearing.

You guys all had
different strengths.

Like your harmonies
were really, really tight.

You guys hit every note.

But Mr. Leatherwood
really shined for me.

37:54.858 --> 37:57.819
I felt more at ease hearing
and watching him, like

37:57.861 --> 38:00.822
there was a calm confidence.
Mm-hmm.

38:00.864 --> 38:02.907
For whatever reason,
I resonated with Bryce

38:02.949 --> 38:04.451
more on this performance.

38:04.492 --> 38:07.370
But I think that you guys
are also really talented.

38:07.412 --> 38:08.705
Well, thank you.

38:08.747 --> 38:10.498
These guys are incredible.
It has been nothing

38:10.540 --> 38:12.000
but a pleasure to work with
these guys.
Thank you, buddy.

38:12.042 --> 38:13.918
Oh, my God,
that's so sweet.

38:13.960 --> 38:15.879
Thank you, Bryce.
Thanks, man.
I can't state that enough.

I didn't know what was going on
in the beginning either,

38:18.048 --> 38:21.718
but I did notice that
as the performance was going on,

38:21.760 --> 38:23.386
it just kept getting
better and better.

38:23.428 --> 38:26.723
And by the end, you guys were
all glued together.
Yeah.

it's fun to watch you.

with Bryce.

38:52.540 --> 38:54.000

38:54.042 --> 38:57.587
Bryce, your voice
is so pure and warm.

38:57.629 --> 38:59.089
You just execute everything

38:59.130 --> 39:02.008
with precision and, like,
confidence and ease.

39:02.050 --> 39:05.095
The only issue I had with it
was that it felt just so easy

39:05.136 --> 39:08.431
that it didn't have any punch
or oomph or fire to it.

39:08.473 --> 39:10.600
Yes, sir.
But I did feel that
from The Dryes.

39:10.642 --> 39:14.020
I felt like the dynamic
was just more electric.

Bryce may be the most purely
on-point vocalist,

more drawn to The Dryes.

All right, buddy,

that's a no-go, so...
