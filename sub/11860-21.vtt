WEBVTT

00:15.667 --> 00:17.458
Alright, now
this is for
you.

00:40.834 --> 00:42.041
Big smile.

00:48.375 --> 00:50.500
I can't wait to be
alone with you.

00:50.583 --> 00:51.667
You say that
to all the
girls.

00:51.750 --> 00:53.792
Uh-uh, just
the hot
ones.

00:53.875 --> 00:57.125
Hey, let's keep those mitts
up
where I can see them, Cole.

00:57.208 --> 00:59.875
- Yes, siree.
- Did I smell alcohol?

00:59.959 --> 01:01.375
Not on me.

01:01.458 --> 01:03.750
I swear on my mom. I don't
even like the taste of it.

01:03.834 --> 01:04.917
Maybe we should
take a walk.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.750
He's in good
hands,
Mr. Burke.

01:06.834 --> 01:08.750
Got my eye on him.

01:14.208 --> 01:17.875
And McKinley High's
new prom queen is..

01:19.375 --> 01:21.083
...Felicia Grant.

01:37.333 --> 01:39.375
I wish this night
would never end.

02:18.041 --> 02:21.542
(John)
Ms. Jacobs, Principal Burke,
this is Detective Rush.

02:21.625 --> 02:23.709
I know you're busy here,
so from one overworked

02:23.792 --> 02:26.625
civil servant to another. I
want
to thank you for the time.

02:26.709 --> 02:27.792
What's up?

02:27.875 --> 02:29.709
Uh, Ms. Jacobs
is faculty advisor

02:29.792 --> 02:31.709
'to the prom committee
at McKinley this year.'

02:31.792 --> 02:34.667
Citywide budget cuts are forcing
us to get creative with a theme.

02:34.750 --> 02:36.542
I was sorting through
some decorations stored

02:36.625 --> 02:38.667
in the basement
hoping to recycle some.

02:38.750 --> 02:42.000
Found a disposable camera
in a box from the '89
prom.

02:42.083 --> 02:43.250
We had it developed.

02:43.333 --> 02:45.000
Thought it'd be fun
to see what the styles

02:45.083 --> 02:46.208
looked like back then.

02:46.291 --> 02:48.667
- Surprised the photos came
out.
- Us, too.

02:48.750 --> 02:52.208
(Ms. Jacobs)
'And then we noticed that she
was in almost every shot.'

02:52.291 --> 02:55.083
- So, who was she?
- Felicia Grant.

02:55.166 --> 02:56.667
Killed by a
hit-and-run
the same night

02:56.750 --> 02:59.166
she was crowned prom queen.
Never found who did it.

02:59.250 --> 03:01.250
I pulled the accident
investigation division
file.

03:01.333 --> 03:03.125
The original
detective
figured she was hit

03:03.208 --> 03:05.583
by a drunk driver
a few miles from the school.

03:05.667 --> 03:07.125
Prom queen didn't have a ride?

03:07.208 --> 03:08.917
Well, according to the
file, her boyfriend was

03:09.000 --> 03:10.583
"too drunk
to drive home."

03:10.667 --> 03:11.792
Cole Austen.

03:11.875 --> 03:14.125
- That, I can attest to.
- So you were there?

03:14.208 --> 03:17.625
I was assistant principal
back then, chaperoned
prom.

03:17.709 --> 03:19.166
(Steve)
'We were all shocked.'

03:19.250 --> 03:21.750
Felicia handed Cole
off
to friends at 11:30.

03:21.834 --> 03:23.291
Said she'd catch a ride.

03:23.375 --> 03:25.875
- An hour later she was dead.
- No one saw her leave?

03:25.959 --> 03:27.291
(Steve)
'I would have been
there, but a student'

03:27.375 --> 03:28.667
fell off the bandstand.

03:28.750 --> 03:30.250
Spent most of the
night in the ER.

03:30.333 --> 03:32.959
- Is this the last photo?
- 'Outside the gym.'

03:33.041 --> 03:34.959
(Steve)
'Everyone always thought
that Felicia ended up'

03:35.041 --> 03:36.959
walking home
from the school.

03:37.041 --> 03:40.208
- But look at the clock.
- 'Hmm, it says 12:15.'

03:40.291 --> 03:42.083
Motorist spotted her body
on the side of the road

03:42.166 --> 03:45.250
about three miles from the
school, called it in at 12:30.

03:45.333 --> 03:46.542
There's no way
she could have walked

03:46.625 --> 03:47.959
three miles
in 15 minutes.

03:48.041 --> 03:49.959
Someone had to
give her a
ride.

03:50.041 --> 03:52.458
Whoever took this picture
was the last to see her alive.

03:52.542 --> 03:54.250
Hmm.

03:54.333 --> 03:55.625
Or her killer.

04:04.375 --> 04:06.333
(Lilly)
Felicia Grant, 17

04:06.417 --> 04:08.959
hit by a car
on Old York Road

04:09.041 --> 04:11.083
walking home from
the prom in '89.

04:11.166 --> 04:13.458
Yeah. Broken neck,
hip, and pelvis.

04:13.542 --> 04:15.500
Multiple skull fractures
and internal bleeding.

04:15.583 --> 04:17.333
Whoever hit her
must
have been hauling.

04:17.417 --> 04:19.500
(John)
'I've seen a car going 30
do some real damage.'

04:19.583 --> 04:21.458
It's all about where
you get hit, not how.

04:21.542 --> 04:24.208
AID tagged it as a
hit-and-run
by a drunk driver.

04:24.291 --> 04:25.834
(Will)
'Kids from the prom
alibi'd out.'

04:25.917 --> 04:27.709
Most went to an
after-party together.

04:27.792 --> 04:30.166
The last photo suggests someone
she knew picked her up.

04:30.250 --> 04:32.041
- 'Talk to the parents?'
- Father passed away.

04:32.125 --> 04:34.667
Mother remarried, moved
to Miami. Trying to find her.

04:34.750 --> 04:37.333
I don't remember dressing
this badly in high school.

04:37.417 --> 04:39.667
You mean, compared to now?

04:39.750 --> 04:41.959
Well, how'd you guys do it
back in the day, Will?

04:42.041 --> 04:43.333
What, did Moses
just hold a candle

04:43.417 --> 04:44.750
'while you guys danced?'

04:46.375 --> 04:48.166
(Will)
'Had our prom at
the Bellevue Hotel.'

04:48.250 --> 04:51.166
Took a lovely, young betty
named Pennie Joe McVicker.

04:51.250 --> 04:53.500
So fine, make
a blind man see.

04:53.583 --> 04:54.834
You ever wonder what
happened to her?

04:54.917 --> 04:58.208
Married, five kids,
twice my size.

04:58.291 --> 05:00.041
- Oh.
- What about you, boss?

05:00.125 --> 05:02.458
I quit school before
the prom. Went in the Navy.

05:02.542 --> 05:06.208
- 'What about you, Lil?'
- Never went. Not my thing.

05:06.291 --> 05:07.458
(Nick)
'Well, I was prom king.'

05:07.542 --> 05:10.083
But I lost my crown
when I, uh..

05:10.166 --> 05:12.125
Well, when I got
caught streaking.

05:12.208 --> 05:14.166
- You streaked at your prom?
- Yeah.

05:14.250 --> 05:15.750
Mrs. Kaye saw my
junk and fainted.

05:15.834 --> 05:17.041
(Lilly)
'Well, AID found silver'

05:17.125 --> 05:18.709
paint chips on the dress.

05:18.792 --> 05:20.041
Assigned checked
all
the body shops

05:20.125 --> 05:22.208
within a 20-mile
radius.
Nothing ever
surfaced.

05:22.291 --> 05:25.041
Well, whoever did it might
have waited a few years

05:25.125 --> 05:27.333
till the heat cooled
and then fixed their ride.

05:27.417 --> 05:30.208
Reinterview Felicia's
inner circle.

05:30.291 --> 05:31.750
Find out who took
that last photo.

05:34.458 --> 05:36.625
Updating your
Facebook page?

05:36.709 --> 05:38.792
Uh, just an old
narcotics case.

05:38.875 --> 05:40.542
Gonna talk to Suzie Hill

05:40.625 --> 05:42.333
the prom queen's
best friend.

05:42.417 --> 05:44.208
- 'Want to come?'
- 'Sure.'

05:44.291 --> 05:45.667
Suzie looks fun.

05:50.041 --> 05:53.625
Uh, my oldest, Tess,
is at cheerleading
practice.

05:53.709 --> 05:56.291
I'm going to need
to grab her soon.

05:57.667 --> 05:59.250
Hey, how many times
do I have to tell you

05:59.333 --> 06:00.792
no running
in the house?

06:00.875 --> 06:04.166
Anything stand out to you
about this photo, Suzie?

06:06.875 --> 06:10.500
Sorry. Seeing Felicia brings
back a lot of memories.

06:11.500 --> 06:13.917
I don't know why
she was still
there.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.667
The school had
a strict midnight curfew.

06:15.750 --> 06:17.792
Didn't you wonder where
she went after prom?

06:17.875 --> 06:20.333
Thought Felicia caught a ride,
we'd hook up later at the
party.

06:20.417 --> 06:23.333
Best friends and you don't
even check up on each other?

06:23.417 --> 06:26.166
We were both sort of caught
up
in our dates that night.

06:26.250 --> 06:28.125
If I knew she needed me,
I would have been there.

06:28.208 --> 06:30.041
So, when was
the last time you saw her?

06:30.125 --> 06:31.500
When she won prom queen.

06:32.750 --> 06:34.083
I was so happy for her.

06:34.166 --> 06:35.709
When we were little
girls,
we used to dress up

06:35.792 --> 06:38.375
act like we were queens
and, now, she was one.

06:38.458 --> 06:41.667
- All sugar, no spice?
- 'She could throw down.'

06:41.750 --> 06:44.709
Felicia wanted something, she
went for it. She always got
it.

06:44.792 --> 06:46.792
Probably made
a few enemies, too?

06:46.875 --> 06:50.166
She was popular.
People's feelings get hurt.

06:50.250 --> 06:52.542
We were all so young
and thoughtless back
then.

06:59.125 --> 07:02.125
- Hey, girl.
- Oh, you know Lee.

07:04.792 --> 07:07.041
Love

07:08.250 --> 07:09.500
I'm going to
go
grab a drink.

07:09.583 --> 07:11.125
Coolio. I'm good.

07:14.083 --> 07:17.166
I can't believe you brought
that weirdo, Lee Mavoides.

07:17.250 --> 07:20.125
Easy for you to say. You weren't
dumped two minutes before prom.

07:20.208 --> 07:21.667
Miss Has-Her-Whole-Life
Planned-Out.

07:21.750 --> 07:22.625
Whatever.

07:22.709 --> 07:24.041
'I got to know him
in art class.'

07:24.125 --> 07:25.333
He's not that bad.

07:25.417 --> 07:27.792
Has that whole Christian
Slater
thing going on.

07:27.875 --> 07:30.291
- I got your letter.
- What'd you say?

07:30.375 --> 07:31.875
[shouting]
I got your letter.

07:31.959 --> 07:34.792
And I like you, too.

07:36.583 --> 07:39.417
- He fell for it!
- 'What a loser.'

07:39.500 --> 07:42.625
Why don't you go home
and hump your pillow,
nerd.

07:44.583 --> 07:46.750
You just wanted
to screw with me.

07:46.834 --> 07:48.583
(male #1)
'What a loser!'

07:52.709 --> 07:54.709
I haven't thought
of Corky in years.

07:54.792 --> 07:56.125
Everyone always
picked on him

07:56.208 --> 07:57.583
but I think that
night
was it for him.

07:57.667 --> 08:00.542
- How so?
- We never saw him again.

08:00.625 --> 08:03.417
He was so mad at Felicia,
thought she made a fool of
him.

08:04.792 --> 08:07.542
Where were you
after the prom?

08:07.625 --> 08:10.792
Uh, Lee took me
up to Fairmount
Park

08:10.875 --> 08:13.875
before we hit
the party, and..

08:13.959 --> 08:16.041
...I was right.
He was sexy.

08:16.125 --> 08:17.542
My daughter
thinks
I'm such a prude

08:17.625 --> 08:18.750
if she only knew.

08:25.834 --> 08:28.208
Hi. Can I help you?

08:28.291 --> 08:30.583
We're looking for
a Corky Mazer.

08:32.333 --> 08:33.917
Last guy that called me
that had to pick

08:34.000 --> 08:35.333
his teeth
off the floor.

08:35.417 --> 08:36.333
I'm not that
guy anymore.

08:36.417 --> 08:38.917
Whoa. Easy there,
Whitey Chan.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.417
We're here to talk
about Felicia
Grant.

08:40.500 --> 08:44.417
Felicia Grant? That's ancient
history. Barely knew her.

08:44.500 --> 08:46.500
Heard she made you look
like a fool on prom night.

08:46.583 --> 08:48.959
Yeah, that was the worst
night of my life.

08:49.041 --> 08:51.417
I'm glad I got far away
from that hellhole.

08:51.500 --> 08:53.208
Sounds more like you
were driven away.

08:53.291 --> 08:56.291
I decided I wasn't going
to be a victim anymore.

08:56.375 --> 08:57.709
(Nick)
'So maybe you
decided to pour'

08:57.792 --> 08:59.250
yourself a nice,
hot cup of
revenge?

08:59.333 --> 09:02.083
No. I joined the
army
the next morning.

09:02.166 --> 09:06.125
Saw the world. It gave
me meaning, purpose.

09:06.208 --> 09:07.583
It gave me...karate.

09:07.667 --> 09:09.959
Or a way to escape
a murder charge.

09:10.041 --> 09:13.875
Murder? I-I thought
some drunk hit her.

09:13.959 --> 09:15.709
You were the president
of the AV department.

09:15.792 --> 09:17.500
Took a lot of
photos that night.

09:17.583 --> 09:18.959
(Corky)
'I didn't take that one.'

09:19.041 --> 09:21.291
And whoever did, didn't know
what they were doing.

09:21.375 --> 09:23.959
What kind of car did you,
uh, drive to the prom,
Evan?

09:25.375 --> 09:27.000
I didn't drive, okay?

09:27.083 --> 09:29.458
My mom dropped me off
and picked me up.

09:29.542 --> 09:32.125
Wow! You had it
hard
in high school.

09:32.208 --> 09:33.834
Kids
kicked
your ass.

09:33.917 --> 09:37.000
- Felicia humiliated you.
- I had lots of problems,
okay?

09:37.083 --> 09:38.959
You know, but I
realized that
night

09:39.041 --> 09:41.000
that I wasn't
the only one.

09:43.875 --> 09:46.166
(Cole)
'Ah, come on, baby.'

09:47.583 --> 09:49.959
'Oh, you're so hot.'

09:51.792 --> 09:54.000
This doesn't feel right.

09:54.083 --> 09:55.000
Really?

09:55.083 --> 09:56.667
'Cause the seats
are real vinyl.

09:56.750 --> 09:58.125
Maybe you're just sitting on
the belt buckle or something.

09:58.208 --> 10:02.875
No, no, I mean us, this.
Going all the way.

10:02.959 --> 10:05.250
- I want it to be special.
- Babe, it is special.

10:05.333 --> 10:08.667
You're with
me,
the Colster.

10:08.750 --> 10:11.583
I want to go find
Corky and apologize.

10:11.667 --> 10:12.834
Corky?

10:12.917 --> 10:15.333
(Cole)
'What are you
talking about?'

10:15.417 --> 10:17.750
I waited two
years
for this.

10:17.834 --> 10:19.166
Look, I even made
us a mix tape.

10:19.250 --> 10:21.166
I want to go inside.

10:21.250 --> 10:22.333
Right now.

10:22.417 --> 10:24.834
You can't just
leave me like
this.

10:24.917 --> 10:26.625
Come on. At
least
check the mic.

10:26.709 --> 10:27.917
Get off!

10:34.750 --> 10:36.291
Come on, Felicia!

10:43.250 --> 10:46.375
I mean, there wasn't a more
entitled guy on the planet.

10:46.458 --> 10:47.750
How come you guys
aren't talking to him?

10:47.834 --> 10:49.542
Cole's alibi checked
out back in the day.

10:49.625 --> 10:51.083
- So did his car.
- Which one?

10:51.166 --> 10:54.291
His dad owned one of the
biggest
car dealerships in Philly.

10:54.375 --> 10:57.083
Cole drove
a new car every month.

11:00.125 --> 11:02.041
Hey, Dad.

11:02.125 --> 11:03.375
I went to the store.

11:03.458 --> 11:05.250
I figured you
could use a..

11:08.500 --> 11:09.750
Hey, sis.

11:12.125 --> 11:13.417
You've got to be kidding me.

11:13.500 --> 11:14.875
- Lilly.
- No.

11:14.959 --> 11:16.000
- No!
- 'Lilly!'

11:16.083 --> 11:17.000
Lilly, wait!

11:25.959 --> 11:27.000
Cole Austen?

11:28.500 --> 11:29.792
Cole Austen?

11:34.458 --> 11:35.542
One and only.

11:35.625 --> 11:36.709
(Nick)
'Far cry from your dad's'

11:36.792 --> 11:38.500
big car dealership, huh?

11:38.583 --> 11:40.083
This gig's
just temporary.

11:40.166 --> 11:41.542
Waiting on a call
from McKinley High

11:41.625 --> 11:44.041
for an assistant football
coaching position.

11:44.125 --> 11:45.083
Sounds promising.

11:45.166 --> 11:46.750
Kind of a legend there.

11:46.834 --> 11:49.166
Just waiting to get
the money right.

11:49.250 --> 11:51.291
You were the '89
prom king at
McKinley.

11:51.375 --> 11:52.792
Damn straight.

11:55.041 --> 11:58.458
It was the greatest
night of my life, man.

11:58.542 --> 12:00.792
Till that, uh..

12:00.875 --> 12:01.792
...till the morning.

12:01.875 --> 12:03.125
- Felicia Grant?
- 'Yeah.'

12:03.208 --> 12:04.625
That was my girl.

12:04.709 --> 12:06.000
If she was your girl,
why'd you leave her alone

12:06.083 --> 12:07.333
at the end of
the night, Cole?

12:07.417 --> 12:09.041
I drank a little
too much clear

12:09.125 --> 12:11.000
and I spent the rest
of the night praying

12:11.083 --> 12:12.458
to the porcelain gods.

12:12.542 --> 12:15.625
- Last time you saw Felicia?
- I don't remember.

12:15.709 --> 12:18.750
Everything after we won prom
king and queen is just a blur.

12:18.834 --> 12:20.125
That's pretty convenient.

12:20.208 --> 12:21.542
(Nick)
'Felicia was hit and killed'

12:21.625 --> 12:23.583
by a silver car.
Kind of like your Mustang.

12:23.667 --> 12:26.208
Ooh. I'd never hurt Felicia.

12:26.291 --> 12:27.542
I loved her.

12:27.625 --> 12:29.250
We were going to go
to Penn State together.

12:29.333 --> 12:31.208
We heard you were
macking some serious moves

12:31.291 --> 12:32.959
on the queen
out in the parking
lot

12:33.041 --> 12:35.667
but, uh, she just
wasn't
feeling the king.

12:35.750 --> 12:37.875
Look, Felicia, she was
just nervous, man.

12:37.959 --> 12:41.000
All she needed was
a little reassuring.

12:43.542 --> 12:45.166
Felicia!

12:45.250 --> 12:47.208
Are you really
looking for
Corky?

12:47.291 --> 12:50.667
- What you did was mean.
- Look, forget him.

12:50.750 --> 12:53.500
Look, I think I know
what's really bugging you.

12:53.583 --> 12:54.834
- You do?
- Yeah.

12:54.917 --> 12:57.083
You're just worried
we're gonna get to State

12:57.166 --> 12:58.667
I'm gonna be
smothered in hotness

12:58.750 --> 13:00.667
and end up hitting it
with a bunch of hot chicks.

13:00.750 --> 13:05.333
- Uh, no, Cole, that's not--
- Not gonna happen.

13:05.417 --> 13:07.208
Look, I could have
played ball anywhere

13:07.291 --> 13:09.667
but I chose
to be with you.

13:11.250 --> 13:13.875
You ever wonder
if you're..

13:13.959 --> 13:15.291
...a good person?

13:15.375 --> 13:16.750
What do you mean?

13:16.834 --> 13:20.709
I've been thinking about
this stuff a lot lately.

13:20.792 --> 13:23.000
After high school..

13:23.083 --> 13:25.834
...who knows what
lies ahead of us?

13:25.917 --> 13:27.250
I do.

13:27.333 --> 13:29.375
More awesomeness.

13:29.458 --> 13:33.750
The '80s ruled,
but the '90s are gonna rock.

13:33.834 --> 13:36.291
You and me, we're going to be
king and queen of Happy Valley.

13:36.375 --> 13:39.333
Felicia? Someone said you
were
crying in the parking lot.

13:39.417 --> 13:41.458
- 'Everything okay?'
- Everything's cool.

13:41.542 --> 13:43.083
Roll, we'll get up
with you guys in a bit.

13:43.166 --> 13:45.083
We want to hear
it
from Felicia.

13:46.250 --> 13:48.875
You can shut your pie hole,
you freaky dink.

13:48.959 --> 13:50.917
Everything's fine.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.041
Just go.

13:56.667 --> 13:57.709
What is it with
you and that
guy?

13:57.792 --> 13:59.083
I don't know.
He creeps me out.

13:59.166 --> 14:00.875
Do you want me
to kick his
ass?

14:00.959 --> 14:03.166
(man over PA)
'Prom Court, please
report to the stage.'

14:03.250 --> 14:05.250
Come on, babe.

14:05.333 --> 14:06.667
It's showtime.

14:09.834 --> 14:13.542
Maybe...if I hadn't
had drank so much that night..

14:14.875 --> 14:16.083
...Felicia'd still
be alive today.

14:16.166 --> 14:19.083
- Who was this Lee guy?
- Lee Mavoides.

14:20.166 --> 14:21.959
He's some
punk-ass freak.

14:22.041 --> 14:24.083
He have some kind
of history with
Felicia?

14:24.166 --> 14:26.166
In his wet dreams.

14:26.250 --> 14:27.250
He was obsessed.

14:27.333 --> 14:28.500
He was always
staring at her.

14:28.583 --> 14:30.750
That's why Felicia
was skeeved out by him.

14:30.834 --> 14:32.458
What happened to your
old Mustang, Cole?

14:34.000 --> 14:35.458
I still got her.

14:37.041 --> 14:38.792
Cops checked her out
back in the day.

14:38.875 --> 14:41.792
Yeah, well, I'd like
to get a second
opinion.

14:50.458 --> 14:51.458
Take me back
to my cell.

14:51.542 --> 14:52.792
I'm not sitting
<i>chota.</i>

14:52.875 --> 14:54.250
Sit down and
shut the hell up.

14:54.333 --> 14:57.000
Why don't you take your
blue Nazi ass back to Philly?

14:57.083 --> 14:59.875
I ain't got nothing
to say to you.

14:59.959 --> 15:03.208
I got this. Why don't
you
go grab some coffee?

15:03.291 --> 15:05.458
Yeah? You real tough
with that tin.

15:05.542 --> 15:08.917
I don't need no badge to
deal
with a little man like
you.

15:15.083 --> 15:16.417
Nice seeing you, man.

15:19.583 --> 15:21.083
<i>Que pasa, Hector?</i>

15:21.166 --> 15:22.750
<i>Tu sabes.</i>

15:22.834 --> 15:24.333
<i>Viviendo como un rey.</i>

15:24.417 --> 15:26.917
- So, I hear.
- Yeah, you got big ears.

15:28.250 --> 15:30.333
Yeah, so do
these
guards.

15:30.417 --> 15:32.583
It's not their ears
I'm worried about.

15:32.667 --> 15:34.458
You know, bad for biz
if anyone finds out

15:34.542 --> 15:36.834
I grew up in Francesville
with a cop.

15:38.458 --> 15:39.917
Yeah, how's Tati?

15:40.000 --> 15:41.959
Thanks to you,
she's good.

15:42.041 --> 15:44.291
Just gave us
another niece.

15:45.917 --> 15:48.250
But that ain't
why you're here.

15:50.041 --> 15:53.417
Look, there's a new
fish on your block.

15:53.500 --> 15:55.000
He likes to sing.

15:55.083 --> 15:57.000
You're his
favorite
song.

15:57.083 --> 16:00.417
Hmm. And what you care
so much about me for?

16:01.959 --> 16:03.375
I wouldn't want
to see your
nieces

16:03.458 --> 16:05.208
growing up
without
<i>tio.</i>

16:06.834 --> 16:10.208
Sounds to me like you want
someone to catch a cold.

16:10.291 --> 16:12.083
It's going around.

16:12.166 --> 16:17.917
But, I mean, how you handle the
jabber...that's your business.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.583
My business, that is
what I'm worried about.

16:20.667 --> 16:24.709
- And this coming back on me.
- I get that.

16:30.417 --> 16:33.291
Alright. Suppose..

16:33.375 --> 16:35.875
Suppose this-this fish, hmm

16:35.959 --> 16:39.417
gets made out to be
a snitch in the yard?

16:39.500 --> 16:42.750
Then...he's
everybody's
problem.

16:42.834 --> 16:44.208
Game over.

16:44.291 --> 16:46.125
Kiss of the bitch.

16:47.291 --> 16:49.959
You know what
<i>papi?</i>

17:01.208 --> 17:03.208
Starting to think you
weren't going to show.

17:04.875 --> 17:06.125
You want to order
something? I'm buying.

17:06.208 --> 17:07.458
I already ate.

17:11.125 --> 17:12.375
Check this out.

17:13.250 --> 17:14.709
Do you remember that suit?

17:14.792 --> 17:16.750
I was always so psyched
when you got a new one

17:16.834 --> 17:19.125
'cause that meant
I got yours.

17:20.500 --> 17:21.917
That day was
so much fun.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.125
The last time I saw
you
there was a warrant

17:24.208 --> 17:26.166
out for your arrest.

17:26.250 --> 17:28.750
Am I sitting across
from a wanted
fugitive?

17:28.834 --> 17:30.959
I cut a deal with
the DA in New York.

17:31.041 --> 17:34.291
- Managed to avoid jail time.
- It's still a felony, right?

17:36.250 --> 17:38.083
I know that you
promised dad

17:38.166 --> 17:40.458
that you were
gonna hear me out.

17:40.542 --> 17:42.000
I want to thank you.

17:44.583 --> 17:46.291
I-I don't have
a lot of time,
so..

17:46.375 --> 17:48.709
- Get to the point, right?
- Hmm.

17:51.959 --> 17:55.000
I've been lost
a long time, Lil.

17:55.083 --> 17:56.875
Made a lot of mistakes.

17:56.959 --> 17:59.834
But...I'm ready
to make a change.

18:00.792 --> 18:01.792
Christina.

18:01.875 --> 18:04.792
I'm staying at
the Grand Inn right now.

18:05.917 --> 18:07.542
Not as fancy as it sounds.

18:07.625 --> 18:09.291
It's a flophouse.

18:09.375 --> 18:10.667
It's cheap.

18:11.917 --> 18:14.583
But I'm looking to move.

18:14.667 --> 18:16.542
Somewhere more permanent.

18:16.625 --> 18:18.166
Near family.

18:18.250 --> 18:20.792
I want to settle down.

18:20.875 --> 18:22.834
Meet a good guy.

18:25.375 --> 18:27.333
What about you, Lil?

18:27.417 --> 18:29.458
You know me.

18:30.542 --> 18:32.125
Working.

18:32.208 --> 18:34.667
Well, working.

18:36.208 --> 18:38.083
Yeah.

18:38.166 --> 18:39.417
Um..

18:41.000 --> 18:42.834
Kind of..

18:42.917 --> 18:44.166
...makes it kind
of hard to get

18:44.250 --> 18:46.250
a rental lease
with a record

18:46.333 --> 18:49.208
so I was hoping you could..

18:49.291 --> 18:51.083
...co-sign for me.

18:52.792 --> 18:55.625
Yeah, shouldn't have guessed
that this was a social visit.

18:55.709 --> 18:58.625
- You always want something.
- I know.

18:59.959 --> 19:02.500
You have no reason
to believe me.

19:04.375 --> 19:06.208
But I need you, Lil.

19:08.458 --> 19:11.041
I don't, I don't
know what to say.

19:11.125 --> 19:13.083
Honestly, every
time
you come around

19:13.166 --> 19:15.166
it's-it's like
a hurricane hit
town.

19:15.250 --> 19:16.542
- Lilly--
- No, Christina.

19:16.625 --> 19:18.542
I promised dad that
I would talk to you

19:18.625 --> 19:21.417
but I-I can't
commit
to anything else.

19:21.500 --> 19:23.667
I mean, maybe it's better
that you find someone else

19:23.750 --> 19:25.917
to clean up after you.

19:30.625 --> 19:32.834
I don't have anyone else.

19:36.250 --> 19:38.583
I wish I could
trust you,
Christina.

19:40.792 --> 19:42.083
I really do.

20:03.542 --> 20:07.041
- Look at you, Slick Willy!
- How?

20:07.125 --> 20:09.208
Called your old high school
and said I needed pictures

20:09.291 --> 20:11.041
for your
retirement
party.

20:11.125 --> 20:13.375
Still, um, this
is the girl that

20:13.458 --> 20:15.000
brought eyesight
to the blind?

20:17.834 --> 20:19.000
And?

20:19.083 --> 20:22.500
And...we located
Felicia's mother.

20:22.583 --> 20:24.375
Still had a few of her
daughter's things in storage.

20:24.458 --> 20:27.208
Look what I found
in her sophomore yearbook.

20:27.291 --> 20:29.417
"What do you see when you look
in the mirror, because I'm

20:29.500 --> 20:32.458
looking right through you
and it's not pretty."

20:32.542 --> 20:34.208
Signed Lee Mavoides.

20:34.291 --> 20:36.333
Tracked him down
to Morgan's Restaurant.

20:36.417 --> 20:38.583
'He's the head chef.'

20:38.667 --> 20:41.500
Well, let's hope his
cooking's
better than his poetry.

20:56.417 --> 20:57.667
(male #2)
'Pig in the pen.'

20:59.792 --> 21:02.166
Yo, Mota?

21:02.250 --> 21:04.041
What's happening, bro?

21:04.125 --> 21:05.542
Tag. You're it, bitch.

21:05.625 --> 21:06.875
That's for my mom.

21:07.750 --> 21:09.125
(male #3)
'What?'

21:09.208 --> 21:10.458
Thanks.

21:12.083 --> 21:14.125
<i>Buena suerte.</i>

21:15.959 --> 21:17.834
(male #4)
'Punk ass.'

21:17.917 --> 21:19.250
(male #5)
'He's a rat.

21:19.333 --> 21:21.000
'Be seeing you rat.'

21:21.083 --> 21:22.917
(male #6)
'What up, you snitch?'

21:29.333 --> 21:32.458
Felicia Grant
killed on prom
night.

21:32.542 --> 21:33.709
Right.

21:33.792 --> 21:36.208
You know, don't
really remember.

21:36.291 --> 21:38.000
High school was
a long time ago.

21:38.083 --> 21:40.166
Maybe this will
help
jog your memory.

21:40.250 --> 21:43.917
Back when you were busy
looking right through
her.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.583
Now that's embarrassing.

21:46.667 --> 21:48.583
What kind of car did
you drive to the
prom?

21:48.667 --> 21:50.375
It was my dad's
Chrysler, I think.

21:50.458 --> 21:52.709
- What color was it?
- I don't know, gray. Look--

21:52.792 --> 21:56.500
Put the knife down when
I'm talking to you,
Emeril.

21:56.583 --> 21:58.500
Look, we used
to be friends.

21:58.583 --> 22:00.375
High school started,
she became a cheerleader

22:00.458 --> 22:02.208
and I became an afterthought.

22:02.291 --> 22:03.500
Bitter pill to swallow?

22:03.583 --> 22:05.875
Yeah, I wrote some mean
things in her yearbook

22:05.959 --> 22:08.959
listened to a lot of Cowboy
Junkies and then I got over
it.

22:09.041 --> 22:10.792
Some strange coincidence
you ended up going

22:10.875 --> 22:14.000
to prom with her best friend?

22:14.083 --> 22:16.375
Yeah, maybe I wanted
to get a rise out of Felicia

22:16.458 --> 22:19.250
but I realized that she really
wasn't worth the drama.

22:24.000 --> 22:27.375
Didn't know you
and Suzie were so close.

22:27.458 --> 22:30.166
You didn't even know
we all go to the same
school.

22:30.250 --> 22:32.583
That's lame.

22:32.667 --> 22:35.917
Anyway, I saw you
on the dance floor.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.834
You two make
a cute
couple.

22:40.166 --> 22:42.417
She's lucky to find
a guy like you.

22:42.500 --> 22:47.917
Guys like me don't really fit
into your whole thing,
Felicia.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.458
What is my whole thing?

22:50.542 --> 22:52.250
Don't be so modest.

22:52.333 --> 22:54.500
You're the queen
of McKinley High.

22:54.583 --> 22:55.750
They even coroneted you.

22:55.834 --> 22:57.792
Hey, I'm trying
to be nice right now.

22:57.875 --> 22:59.417
You don't have
to be such a jackass.

22:59.500 --> 23:00.542
You came to talk to me.

23:00.625 --> 23:02.583
Yeah, because we used
to be friends.

23:02.667 --> 23:04.417
We used to make pizza and..

23:04.500 --> 23:06.250
...geek out to old
"Twilight Zones," remember?

23:06.333 --> 23:08.834
I still like to make pizzas
and watch old TV.

23:08.917 --> 23:11.291
It was you that
changed,
Felicia.

23:11.375 --> 23:13.291
And now, you've
got the crown.

23:14.667 --> 23:16.250
You're just so
above it all.

23:16.333 --> 23:17.917
If life's
about
being liked

23:18.000 --> 23:19.875
you win, okay?
Everybody loves
you.

23:19.959 --> 23:22.417
No. No, they
don't love me.

23:22.500 --> 23:25.583
They want to be me
or they want to get with me

23:25.667 --> 23:27.291
but they definitely
don't love me.

23:27.375 --> 23:30.125
Love, said the girl who
treated
high school like a contest.

23:30.208 --> 23:31.500
Lee, wait.

23:33.500 --> 23:35.750
You came to see
if I was okay before.

23:37.709 --> 23:41.083
I figure that had to mean
you still cared...a little.

23:41.166 --> 23:43.500
And unlike the
rest
of your friends

23:43.583 --> 23:45.667
I can tell
you've
been
miserable.

23:45.750 --> 23:48.834
So, yes,
I was
worried.

23:48.917 --> 23:50.125
Thanks.

23:51.125 --> 23:53.291
You're the only
one who noticed.

24:00.041 --> 24:01.959
I hate you,
Felicia Grant!

24:02.583 --> 24:05.000
Oh, Suzie, wait.

24:12.583 --> 24:15.792
Suzie refused to even look
at me for the rest of the
night.

24:15.875 --> 24:19.125
I think living in Felicia's
shadow kind of ruined her.

24:19.208 --> 24:23.625
Suzie said the two of you went
to Fairmount Park after prom.

24:23.709 --> 24:25.667
She went to
the after-party.

24:25.750 --> 24:28.959
I smoked a couple bowls,
and ended up at IHOP.

24:29.041 --> 24:30.125
Alone.

24:34.291 --> 24:36.041
Scotty, what are
you doing here?

24:36.125 --> 24:38.208
Brought you some of those
<i>pastelitos de coco</i>

24:38.291 --> 24:40.083
you love so much.

24:40.166 --> 24:41.750
In the middle
of the
afternoon?

24:41.834 --> 24:44.375
Well, I had an
interview nearby.

24:44.458 --> 24:47.375
What, a son can't bring
his own mother some
pastries?

24:47.458 --> 24:49.417
Of course.
Thank you,
<i>mijito.</i>

24:49.500 --> 24:54.125
<i>Quieres cafe?</i>
-

24:54.208 --> 24:56.083
Oh, honey, you can sit for
ten minutes. Come on, sit.

24:56.166 --> 24:58.333
No, ma, I can't.
I can't.

25:05.291 --> 25:06.583
Are you okay?

25:08.792 --> 25:11.083
Yeah.

25:11.166 --> 25:12.500
Never better.

25:21.000 --> 25:24.333
(Scotty)
I think she's
about
ready to spill.

25:24.417 --> 25:28.125
Scotty, my sister
didn't contact you, did she?

25:28.208 --> 25:30.166
Christina?

25:30.250 --> 25:34.834
- No.
- Well..

25:34.917 --> 25:37.583
- She's back in town.
- Hmm.

25:37.667 --> 25:42.500
I just, you know, maybe she'd
call you, you know, booty
call.

25:43.083 --> 25:44.375
No, Lil.

25:47.417 --> 25:48.500
Well, never mind.

25:48.583 --> 25:50.166
Let's just do this.

25:51.834 --> 25:53.125
Well, sorry, if we
kept you waiting.

25:53.208 --> 25:56.625
Just got caught up
The Odyssey

25:56.709 --> 25:58.375
You're all over
this thing.

25:58.458 --> 26:01.166
Vice president
of the student body

26:01.250 --> 26:04.542
co-captain of
the cheerleading squad.

26:04.625 --> 26:07.291
Second most popular girl
at McKinley High.

26:07.375 --> 26:10.125
(Scotty)
'That must have been
hard, being number two.'

26:10.208 --> 26:13.083
Always good,
just never good enough.

26:13.166 --> 26:15.208
Ever get sick
of it, Suzie?

26:15.291 --> 26:17.250
Living in
Felicia's shadow?

26:17.333 --> 26:20.959
- She was my best friend.
- And your worst enemy.

26:21.041 --> 26:22.291
Same thing, right.

26:22.375 --> 26:24.458
Sure, you eat her dust
for four years

26:24.542 --> 26:26.083
then she pays you
back on prom night

26:26.166 --> 26:27.583
by taking
your boyfriend.

26:27.667 --> 26:30.417
- Boyfriend? I hardly knew
Lee.
- Well, that was the point.

26:30.500 --> 26:33.583
Pick a guy you figure
Felicia won't know.

26:33.667 --> 26:35.500
And even then..

26:35.583 --> 26:37.083
...you're runner-up.

26:37.166 --> 26:39.875
You told us you were parking
with Lee when Felicia died.

26:39.959 --> 26:41.125
That's right.

26:41.208 --> 26:43.083
(Scotty)
'Last time he saw you was..'

26:43.166 --> 26:44.834
...at the dance.

26:44.917 --> 26:47.333
Said you wanted to have
the prom queen's head.

26:49.041 --> 26:51.458
Why'd you lie
about your alibi?

26:51.542 --> 26:54.625
- Because I was embarrassed.
- Embarrassed?

26:54.709 --> 26:55.750
You ever been locked up?

26:55.834 --> 26:57.458
I mean, because
I acted like a child.

26:57.542 --> 26:58.875
It was high school.

26:58.959 --> 27:00.583
Everything was
always
so dramatic.

27:00.667 --> 27:03.667
And afterwards you realize
how stupid those fights were.

27:03.750 --> 27:07.458
What happened between you
and Felicia that night,
Suzie?

27:09.583 --> 27:10.792
I saw..

27:12.250 --> 27:14.583
...Felicia with Lee and..

27:14.667 --> 27:16.750
...I wanted to hurt
her so badly..

27:17.959 --> 27:19.917
...and I got my chance.

27:21.583 --> 27:24.709
Suzie, please, listen.

27:24.792 --> 27:26.000
It's not
what
it looked
like.

27:26.083 --> 27:27.417
Well, thank God,
'cause it sure looked like

27:27.500 --> 27:28.542
you were trying
to stick your tongue

27:28.625 --> 27:30.709
'down my date's throat.'

27:30.792 --> 27:32.542
Hey, we're not
selling tickets
here.

27:32.625 --> 27:33.959
Get out.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.709
I don't get it, Felicia.

27:40.792 --> 27:43.709
Your quarterback boyfriend
isn't
good enough for you anymore?

27:43.792 --> 27:46.875
- That's not it.
- No? Why?

27:46.959 --> 27:48.583
Why my date?

27:50.667 --> 27:52.041
You remember..

27:53.667 --> 27:57.000
...the guy I told you I lost my
virginity to a few years back?

27:58.542 --> 28:01.834
Yeah, some college guy
down the shore.

28:04.125 --> 28:06.333
He lived on
my block,
Suzie.

28:10.041 --> 28:11.166
Lee?

28:15.667 --> 28:17.959
It was a mistake.

28:18.041 --> 28:19.291
We were way too young

28:19.375 --> 28:21.875
and it's way over.

28:21.959 --> 28:24.417
If you like him,
you should go for
it.

28:24.500 --> 28:26.208
So I get your
sloppy seconds?

28:28.083 --> 28:30.333
That's not
what I
meant.

28:30.417 --> 28:31.959
You're my best friend.

28:32.041 --> 28:33.750
Closest friend
in the world.

28:35.208 --> 28:37.959
You are the only
thing
in this ridiculous
place

28:38.041 --> 28:39.709
that matters to me.

28:39.792 --> 28:44.333
You're acting like we're never
going to see each other again.

28:44.417 --> 28:47.208
I'd never forgive
myself if I hurt
you.

28:49.333 --> 28:50.500
Please.

28:52.333 --> 28:54.208
Say we're okay.

28:58.834 --> 29:00.500
We're okay.

29:10.041 --> 29:12.166
She reached out to me.

29:12.250 --> 29:15.625
And all I could see was
an opportunity to take her
down.

29:17.250 --> 29:20.458
I needed her to know
what it felt like to lose.

29:20.542 --> 29:22.709
What did you do, Suzie?

29:24.583 --> 29:28.709
I told Cole about Felicia
and Lee and then..

29:29.625 --> 29:31.667
...later at the after-party..

29:33.917 --> 29:36.458
...I hooked up with him.

29:36.542 --> 29:40.417
I thought Cole
was
long passed out.

29:40.500 --> 29:44.000
Oh, sure, he was
plastered, but..

29:45.875 --> 29:47.291
...he was awake.

29:55.166 --> 29:57.166
The Colster and I were
just going back over

29:57.250 --> 29:58.375
the events of prom night.

29:58.458 --> 29:59.542
Right.

29:59.625 --> 30:01.000
Did you get to the part
where he lied about

30:01.083 --> 30:03.625
being passed out in
the back of that car?

30:03.709 --> 30:04.917
I didn't lie
about
nothing.

30:05.000 --> 30:08.417
Been claiming you out
cold, but not so drunk

30:08.500 --> 30:10.625
you didn't try to get
over on Suzie Hill.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.875
- I don't remember that at
all.
- 'Don't flatter yourself.'

30:15.959 --> 30:17.500
She doesn't remember
much of it either.

30:17.583 --> 30:21.667
Boys down in the garage did some
analysis of your '89 Mustang.

30:21.750 --> 30:24.750
Turns out the paint on the
front
bumper has been replaced.

30:24.834 --> 30:27.208
Doesn't match
the factory original.

30:27.291 --> 30:29.875
I had an accident
a few years ago.

30:29.959 --> 30:32.375
Back-ended some truck.

30:32.458 --> 30:34.125
So what, you forgot
to file a report?

30:34.208 --> 30:37.333
No, I wanted to leave the
insurance companies out of it.

30:37.417 --> 30:40.417
This isn't the first lie
you've told us there,
Colster.

30:40.500 --> 30:41.750
What about all that
smoke you were blowing

30:41.834 --> 30:43.834
about big-time
college ball?

30:43.917 --> 30:47.041
Okay, so I
exaggerate a
little.

30:47.125 --> 30:48.792
Don't mean
I hurt
Felicia.

30:48.875 --> 30:52.875
- 'Like I said passed out.'
- No, you were blacked out.

30:52.959 --> 30:54.667
'Means you just don't
remember what you did.'

30:54.750 --> 30:56.583
Like hooking up
with Suzie.

30:56.667 --> 30:59.208
Or getting in your car
and tracking down
Felicia.

30:59.291 --> 31:02.333
(Scotty)
'If I found out
my high school girlfriend'

31:02.417 --> 31:04.625
was messing around..

31:04.709 --> 31:07.333
...especially
with
a guy like
Lee..

31:07.417 --> 31:10.417
...there's no telling
what I'd have done.

31:10.500 --> 31:13.458
That night was supposed
to end different.

31:17.834 --> 31:19.959
You touched my girl.
I'm gonna break your
face.

31:20.041 --> 31:22.375
Dude, I don't
want any trouble.

31:23.458 --> 31:25.291
Lee, that's enough!

31:25.375 --> 31:28.083
- Just go.
- This is pathetic.

31:30.709 --> 31:32.792
Are you okay?
You hurt?

31:32.875 --> 31:37.959
I can't believe
you would do him and not me.

31:38.041 --> 31:39.792
It was a mistake.

31:39.875 --> 31:42.667
One I-I don't want
to make again.

31:42.750 --> 31:46.792
I, I kept trying to pretend like
tonight was going to be special

31:46.875 --> 31:48.959
and that I wanted it too, but..

31:49.041 --> 31:52.000
...Cole, we both know
it's not true.

31:55.208 --> 31:57.125
Let's call it, Cole.

31:58.875 --> 32:00.625
Wait a minute, you..

32:00.709 --> 32:02.667
You're breaking up with me?

32:02.750 --> 32:03.625
At prom?

32:03.709 --> 32:06.500
I know, I know. My timing sucks.

32:06.583 --> 32:08.333
Babe, we were
meant to be together.

32:08.417 --> 32:10.083
Come on. I love you.

32:10.166 --> 32:11.417
You don't even know me.

32:11.500 --> 32:13.750
No way, babe,
this runs deep.

32:13.834 --> 32:15.875
Yeah, you say that now.

32:15.959 --> 32:18.250
Next year it's
all going to fade.

32:18.333 --> 32:21.500
What? We're going to Penn
State.
Coed dorm, right?

32:21.583 --> 32:24.083
I'm not going to State.

32:25.959 --> 32:27.417
I'm going to Berkeley.

32:29.709 --> 32:32.166
What? Berkeley?

32:32.250 --> 32:35.208
Mr. Burke wanted
me to apply.

32:35.291 --> 32:37.083
He put in a call to his
friend in admissions

32:37.166 --> 32:39.875
and I just got off
the wait list.

32:39.959 --> 32:42.291
- Why didn't you tell me?
- 'I didn't tell anyone.'

32:42.375 --> 32:44.083
I wasn't sure before.

32:46.959 --> 32:49.583
Look, Cole,
it's
not about you.

32:49.667 --> 32:52.458
I just...I wanted to
go somewhere new

32:52.542 --> 32:54.709
where I didn't
know anybody.

32:56.375 --> 32:58.417
You have no idea
what I'm saying, do you?

32:58.500 --> 33:01.625
You're saying I'm not
getting any tonight.

33:03.625 --> 33:05.542
Sorry.

33:05.625 --> 33:09.542
But if it's
any
consolation

33:09.625 --> 33:13.542
you can tell the
team
any story you want.

33:13.625 --> 33:15.667
Your rep's safe with me.

33:17.583 --> 33:20.709
Hey, we never got a picture
together as king and queen.

33:25.583 --> 33:26.834
Come here.

33:34.166 --> 33:36.000
High school..

33:36.083 --> 33:40.166
...was the only time that
my life was worth a damn.

33:40.250 --> 33:41.458
And prom?

33:41.542 --> 33:44.083
That was supposed
to top it all..

33:44.166 --> 33:45.542
...but it blew.

33:45.625 --> 33:47.959
Girlfriend left you
you got your ass
kicked.

33:48.041 --> 33:49.917
Ended up spending the rest
of the night in the ER

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
getting my stomach pumped.

33:52.083 --> 33:54.333
Didn't tell anybody that
she broke it off with me.

33:54.417 --> 33:56.542
Wanted to keep up my image.

33:56.625 --> 33:59.125
I was always the Colster.

34:00.125 --> 34:02.333
No one can ever
take that from me.

34:02.417 --> 34:05.208
That picture Felicia
took when was that?

34:05.291 --> 34:06.500
Um..

34:07.750 --> 34:11.709
...end of prom,
I guess, uh, around
11:30.

34:13.959 --> 34:17.500
Disposable cameras from
that night had 24 exposures.

34:17.583 --> 34:19.500
Stack of photos
from Felicia's camera?

34:19.583 --> 34:22.000
- Only 23.
- One photo's missing.

34:22.083 --> 34:24.792
The one she took of her
and Cole at the end of prom.

34:24.875 --> 34:27.333
- Never got developed?
- It got developed, alright.

34:27.417 --> 34:30.583
Went back to the CVS. They keep
the negatives on computer now.

34:30.667 --> 34:33.333
So either Mrs. Jacobs or
Principal Burke got rid
of it.

34:33.417 --> 34:35.542
Ms. Jacobs was barely
in elementary school

34:35.625 --> 34:37.041
when Felicia was killed.

34:37.125 --> 34:39.125
Look closer.
Check out the car.

34:40.750 --> 34:43.000
(John)
'Silver, looks like a
Volvo.'

34:43.083 --> 34:45.291
Looked up
DMV records for '89.

34:45.375 --> 34:48.166
Principal Burke owned
the same make and model.

34:49.625 --> 34:51.291
(Lilly)
'Are you sure?'

34:51.375 --> 34:53.208
When did you
notice
it was missing?

34:55.041 --> 34:57.542
No. No,
dad,
it's not
okay.

34:58.750 --> 35:00.125
(Lilly)
'No, I'll handle it.'

35:00.208 --> 35:01.542
Damn it.

35:05.959 --> 35:09.834
- What was that?
- Christina just disappeared.

35:09.917 --> 35:13.125
Along with some
jewelry
at my dad's house.

35:13.208 --> 35:14.500
Should have known.

35:16.458 --> 35:19.834
If you need help,
say the word.

35:19.917 --> 35:21.166
I'll handle it.

35:22.875 --> 35:24.709
Just gotta take
care
of this first.

35:28.458 --> 35:29.875
(John)
'According to DMV records'

35:29.959 --> 35:34.875
Mr. Burke, you drove
a silver Volvo back in '89?

35:34.959 --> 35:35.917
That's right.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.667
It's right
here
in this
photo

35:37.750 --> 35:41.375
the one that you neglected to
share with us taken at 11:30.

35:41.458 --> 35:44.208
- 'Right as the prom ended.'
- 'Bit confusing.'

35:44.291 --> 35:46.250
You said you were in the ER

35:46.333 --> 35:48.750
all night with
an injured student.

35:50.291 --> 35:51.583
Where are you
going with this?

35:51.667 --> 35:52.750
Felicia Grant
was mowed down

35:52.834 --> 35:54.291
by a vehicle with
the same paint job.

35:54.375 --> 35:55.709
(Lilly)
'It must have been
a real shock'

35:55.792 --> 35:58.417
when Ms. Jacobs found
that old camera.

35:58.500 --> 36:00.500
All those
photos
of Felicia.

36:00.583 --> 36:02.959
Like a ghost coming
back to haunt you.

36:03.041 --> 36:04.542
(Lilly)
'We spoke to Ms. Jacobs.'

36:04.625 --> 36:06.750
And she said
that at first

36:06.834 --> 36:08.875
you didn't think those
photos were, you know,
worth

36:09.000 --> 36:09.959
bringing to the police.

36:10.041 --> 36:11.959
Well, she's mistaken.

36:12.041 --> 36:13.583
I want justice for Felicia

36:13.667 --> 36:15.083
just as much as anyone.

36:15.166 --> 36:18.000
- She was a special student.
- 'No doubt about that.'

36:19.500 --> 36:21.917
"Felicia has
an intelligence and maturity

36:22.000 --> 36:24.291
"that far exceeds
even
the best students.

36:24.375 --> 36:27.333
Her star burns
brightly at
McKinley."

36:27.417 --> 36:28.792
(John)
'The letter of recommendation'

36:28.875 --> 36:32.291
you sent to Cal-Berkeley
on her behalf.

36:32.375 --> 36:34.542
I've written
hundreds
of recommendations.

36:34.625 --> 36:36.500
You went the extra mile
for Felicia.

36:36.583 --> 36:37.917
Put several phone calls in

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
to make sure she got
taken off the wait list.

36:40.083 --> 36:43.375
Are you suggesting we had
an inappropriate
relationship?

36:43.458 --> 36:45.500
<i>girl.</i>

36:45.583 --> 36:49.959
Felicia was no ordinary
student, now, was she?

36:51.750 --> 36:52.792
What makes you think--

36:52.875 --> 36:54.041
'Cause you've been
in this room

36:54.125 --> 36:56.083
with two dozen
photos of
Felicia

36:56.166 --> 36:58.750
and you've barely
looked at her
once.

36:58.834 --> 37:00.709
Look

37:03.250 --> 37:05.041
(John)
'You went to four
different auto shops'

37:05.125 --> 37:06.834
for replacement
parts
for that Volvo.

37:06.917 --> 37:09.291
You fixed it yourself.

37:09.375 --> 37:10.792
You should have paid cash.

37:12.375 --> 37:13.667
(Lilly)
'She was left there.'

37:13.750 --> 37:16.333
Her date was too
drunk
to drive her home.

37:16.417 --> 37:17.750
And then there you were.

37:21.375 --> 37:23.458
(Steve)
'Felicia?'

37:23.542 --> 37:24.792
What are you
still doing here?

37:24.875 --> 37:27.291
<i>(Steve)</i>
<i>She needed a ride.</i>

37:27.375 --> 37:29.291
Believe that?

37:29.375 --> 37:32.208
The prom queen
was left behind.

37:32.291 --> 37:34.667
Was I supposed
to leave her there?

37:34.750 --> 37:37.041
You were supposed
to drive her home.

37:38.583 --> 37:41.458
Mr. Burke, we're supposed to
turn these in to prom
committee

37:41.542 --> 37:43.875
but there's still
one picture left.

37:43.959 --> 37:46.750
Here. One last shot
of the prom queen.

37:46.834 --> 37:49.625
Tomorrow you turn back
into a pumpkin, so..

37:52.709 --> 37:54.542
Come on. Let's get
out of here.

37:54.625 --> 37:57.166
<i>(Lilly)</i>
<i>But something happened</i>
<i>on the way there, right?</i>

38:01.417 --> 38:04.500
I always knew
where to draw the line.

38:04.583 --> 38:07.959
A joke, a pat
on the back.

38:08.041 --> 38:10.542
But Felicia was
special, wasn't she?

38:15.125 --> 38:17.667
(Steve)
She was different.

38:17.750 --> 38:21.542
Beautiful. But so much
more than that.

38:21.625 --> 38:23.125
She had it all.

38:24.583 --> 38:27.083
I just wanted to be
a part of that.

38:31.625 --> 38:34.875
So, no after-party?

38:34.959 --> 38:37.417
- Just going home.
- 'Come on.'

38:37.500 --> 38:40.166
The prom queen can't end
the night with a whimper.

38:40.250 --> 38:42.917
I just don't feel
much like
partying.

38:45.709 --> 38:46.959
Hey.

38:48.250 --> 38:49.500
Felicia.

38:56.583 --> 38:57.917
Something happen?

38:59.542 --> 39:02.709
No. No, it's just
a crazy night.

39:03.875 --> 39:05.250
I think I lost
my best friend.

39:05.333 --> 39:08.083
I broke up with Cole.

39:10.375 --> 39:11.583
Hey.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.750
It's okay.
Cole Austen?

39:15.834 --> 39:19.542
I mean, you've been out of
his league for a long time.

39:21.583 --> 39:23.250
It's more than Cole.

39:24.500 --> 39:26.750
I'm saying goodbye
to everything I know.

39:30.041 --> 39:32.125
I'm excited to move on.

39:33.375 --> 39:34.875
'But also..'

39:34.959 --> 39:36.667
...I'm terrified.

39:39.041 --> 39:40.959
Does that make sense?

39:41.041 --> 39:42.875
Perfect.

39:42.959 --> 39:44.041
It's normal.

39:45.709 --> 39:48.417
I'm proud of you, Felicia.

39:48.500 --> 39:49.709
Thanks, Mr. Burke.

39:49.792 --> 39:52.208
Oh, please, you're
practically
graduated.

39:52.291 --> 39:54.291
You can call me Steve.

39:54.375 --> 39:56.959
Okay...Steve.

40:00.083 --> 40:01.917
You've always
been so cool.

40:05.542 --> 40:07.875
I don't even really
think of you like a
teacher.

40:10.041 --> 40:12.291
I don't think of you
as just any student.

40:14.750 --> 40:17.083
Mr. Burke.
What the hell?

40:18.834 --> 40:22.000
I'm sorry! I, um,
I must have
misread..

40:22.083 --> 40:23.959
- I have to go.
- Wait! No, wait, Listen to
me.

40:24.041 --> 40:25.875
Listen to me! Let's just
forget
this ever happened, okay?

40:25.959 --> 40:27.500
- I feel sick.
- Wait. Listen!

40:27.583 --> 40:29.375
Mr. Burke,
you're hurting me.

40:29.458 --> 40:31.291
Calm down. We're gonna
keep this between us,
okay?

40:31.375 --> 40:33.291
- Let go!
- We need to talk about this!

40:33.375 --> 40:35.709
- Wait, let's talk about
it!
- Leave me alone.

40:35.792 --> 40:37.000
Felicia, wait!
