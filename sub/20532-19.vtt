00:00.134 --> 00:02.835
¶¶

00:09.543 --> 00:12.511
¶ I was a girl in the village
doing all right ¶

00:12.513 --> 00:14.880
¶ Then I became a princess
overnight ¶

00:14.882 --> 00:17.616
¶ Now I gotta figure out
how to do it right ¶

00:17.618 --> 00:19.385
¶ So much to learn and see ¶

00:19.387 --> 00:22.554
¶ Up in the castle
with my new family ¶

00:22.556 --> 00:25.290
¶ In a school
that's just for royalty ¶

00:25.292 --> 00:29.495
¶ A whole enchanted world
is waiting for me ¶

00:32.700 --> 00:36.668
¶ I'm finding out
what being royal's all about ¶

00:36.670 --> 00:38.170
¶ Sofia the first ¶

00:38.172 --> 00:39.671
¶ Making my way ¶

00:39.673 --> 00:41.707
¶ It's an adventure every day ¶

00:41.709 --> 00:44.710

-  ¶ It's gonna be my time ¶

00:44.712 --> 00:46.912
- ¶ Sofia
- ¶ To show them all that I'm ¶

01:08.369 --> 01:10.602
[man] Biscuit, whoa!
Calm down, girl!

01:10.604 --> 01:13.038
The bridge is out!
Someone please help!

01:13.040 --> 01:14.606
I've got this!

01:14.608 --> 01:16.442
Whuuup! Unhh!

01:16.444 --> 01:19.178
-[panicky chatter]
-I can't watch!

01:19.180 --> 01:22.214
-[man] Look out!
-Whoa, there, girl.

01:22.216 --> 01:25.117
Good girl. You okay?

01:25.119 --> 01:27.119
Princess Sofia!
[panting]

01:27.121 --> 01:29.321
-Thank you!
-I was happy to help.

01:37.131 --> 01:39.098
Now, please. Have a pie...

01:39.100 --> 01:40.232
with our thanks.

01:40.234 --> 01:42.734
Oh. Well, thank you.

01:42.736 --> 01:45.938
Come, Biscuit.
You can't make me run
like that, old girl.

01:45.940 --> 01:49.775
-Oh! That was incredible, Sofia!
-So heroic!

01:49.777 --> 01:53.579
You just jumped on that horse
and--boom!--problem solved.

01:53.581 --> 01:54.980
Thanks. It's fun to help.

01:54.982 --> 01:58.750
Oh, it must be nice
bein' a hero.

01:58.752 --> 02:02.754
Solving problems,
gettin' pies...

02:02.756 --> 02:05.657
Well, it's not all about
getting pies, Clover.

02:05.659 --> 02:07.626
There's lots of hard work
and training.

02:07.628 --> 02:10.395
Never fear, horse!
I gotcha!

02:10.397 --> 02:11.897
Duhn-da-da!

02:11.899 --> 02:13.999
You know, I think
I'd be a pretty good hero.

02:14.001 --> 02:17.903
Sure. You could be
the aw-dorable hero.

02:17.905 --> 02:20.839
Or you could be
the first bunny hero!

02:20.841 --> 02:23.675
Hero Clover!
Report to Enchantia--

02:23.677 --> 02:26.411
some carrots need
to be eaten immediately!

02:26.413 --> 02:29.515
[both giggling]

02:29.517 --> 02:31.250
Ha ha. Very funny.

02:31.252 --> 02:32.684
I don't care what they say.

02:32.686 --> 02:35.254
You'll always be
a hero to me, Clover.

02:35.256 --> 02:37.256
In fact, here.

02:37.258 --> 02:39.324
Really?
Thank you!

02:39.326 --> 02:41.994
I better go. I have to report
to the Mystic Isles

02:41.996 --> 02:43.996
for some special
Protector training.

02:43.998 --> 02:46.265
Because being a hero
isn't all about eating.

02:46.267 --> 02:47.499
[munching] Mmm!

02:47.501 --> 02:49.001
Sorry, Sof. You were saying?

02:49.003 --> 02:51.870
[Sofia laughs]
Bye, Clover.

02:51.872 --> 02:54.873
Carrots need to be eaten
immediately!

02:54.875 --> 02:56.642
-[birds laughing]
-Aah, what do they know?

02:56.644 --> 02:58.677
I'll show 'em I got
what it takes to be a hero!

02:58.679 --> 03:00.846
Come on, Whatnaught.
-[squirrel chittering]

03:00.848 --> 03:03.115
[Clover] What's that?
A runaway dragon?

03:03.117 --> 03:06.118
No problem.
Hero Clover is here!

03:06.120 --> 03:07.786
I gotcha, dragon!

03:07.788 --> 03:10.789
Now run home
to your fire-breathin' momma.

03:10.791 --> 03:12.357
Ha ha! What? No!

03:12.359 --> 03:13.892
Come on, what's this?

03:13.894 --> 03:16.795
A medal? And a banquet
in my honor?

03:16.797 --> 03:18.864
Oh, thank you so much!

03:18.866 --> 03:21.066
No, please, no applause.

03:21.068 --> 03:24.736
I do this for the people.
-[Whatnaught chittering]

03:24.738 --> 03:27.072
Eh, those are just
Wassailia ornaments,
Whatnaught.

03:27.074 --> 03:28.807
Wait. In summer?

03:28.809 --> 03:31.310
Oh. Hero Clover,

03:31.312 --> 03:33.312
ready to investigate!

03:33.314 --> 03:34.379
Aaah!

03:36.517 --> 03:37.916
Oh, Hidey.

03:37.918 --> 03:40.052
He's just a--
Uh, what are you?

03:40.054 --> 03:42.588
I'm a rabbit.
Uh, what are you?

03:42.590 --> 03:43.922
We're Hoodwinks.

03:43.924 --> 03:46.692
We came from  the Mystic Isles
to find Princess Sofia.

03:46.694 --> 03:48.860
She's a Protector,
and our friend.

03:48.862 --> 03:50.929
I'm Clover.
Sofia's my best friend.

03:50.931 --> 03:53.432
You're Princess Sofia's
friend, too?

03:53.434 --> 03:54.866
Wow! Do you know
where she is?

03:54.868 --> 03:57.169
Sofia, she's...
gone away for a while.

03:57.171 --> 03:58.704
Oh, dear!

03:58.706 --> 04:00.839
Uh, maybe I can
help you instead?

04:00.841 --> 04:02.241
Are you a Protector?

04:02.243 --> 04:03.709
Yeah, practically.

04:03.711 --> 04:04.943
Um, in fact,

04:04.945 --> 04:07.112
she said I'm her hero.

04:07.114 --> 04:09.781
Oh! You're Sofia's friend?

04:09.783 --> 04:11.750
And her hero?

04:11.752 --> 04:13.785
That's impressive.

04:13.787 --> 04:15.754
Hoodwink huddle-up!

04:15.756 --> 04:17.456
[both whispering]

04:17.458 --> 04:18.624
[Whatnaught chittering]

04:18.626 --> 04:19.791
Whatnaught, chill.

04:19.793 --> 04:21.593
Look how teensy and cute
those fuzzballs are.

04:21.595 --> 04:23.562
How tough could
their problem be? Okay?

04:23.564 --> 04:25.764
[chittering]

04:25.766 --> 04:28.533
Ahem. We accept your offer
of assistance.

04:28.535 --> 04:30.802
Since we don't really
have a choice.

04:30.804 --> 04:32.804
Ha! And you won't regret it.

04:32.806 --> 04:36.875
I'm just the rabbit
to get the job done!
Ha ha ha ha!

04:36.877 --> 04:40.545
[Clover] What?! Unicorn?

04:40.547 --> 04:42.814
Yo, classy!

04:42.816 --> 04:45.250
It's the only way
to get to the Mystic Isles.

04:45.252 --> 04:47.319
Right, right, right.
I knew that.

04:47.321 --> 04:48.787
Um, I meant to ask,

04:48.789 --> 04:51.790
when I solve your problem,
will I get something?

04:51.792 --> 04:53.992
-Get something?
-A reward.

04:53.994 --> 04:56.128
Like, say, uh, a pie?

04:56.130 --> 04:58.730
Or a parade?
Or a pie and a parade?

04:58.732 --> 05:00.432
You know, to celebrate
my accomplishments!

05:00.434 --> 05:04.736
Oh. Uh, sure. There can be
a parade if you want. Or pie.

05:04.738 --> 05:09.007
Great. I am going
to sort this thing out
one, two, three.

05:09.009 --> 05:09.875
You'll see.

05:11.979 --> 05:13.812
[unicorn whinnies]

05:13.814 --> 05:15.180
[Sofia]
So, Chrysta,

05:15.182 --> 05:16.815
why are we way up here?

05:16.817 --> 05:19.084
Well, it's the safest place
to learn your next skill.

05:19.086 --> 05:20.986
It's a tough one.
-Oh, great.

05:20.988 --> 05:22.287
I like the tough ones.

05:22.289 --> 05:24.456
This is the toughest.

05:24.458 --> 05:26.925
You're gonna use
your Enchantment
to make a WindWhip.

05:26.927 --> 05:28.960
-That sounds hard.
-Yup.

05:28.962 --> 05:31.196
It's gonna take
a lot out of you.
Have you eaten?

05:31.198 --> 05:33.832
Good thing our Pep-Apples
are in season.

05:33.834 --> 05:36.034
Here, have a couple.
You're gonna need your energy.

05:36.036 --> 05:37.636
Mmm! Mm-hmm.

05:37.638 --> 05:38.837
Mmm. Thank you.

05:38.839 --> 05:40.806
Now, while you
munch on those,

05:40.808 --> 05:42.374
let me show you
how it's done.

05:42.376 --> 05:44.443
-Observe.
-[ethereal chiming]

05:46.013 --> 05:48.113
[wind whooshes]

05:48.115 --> 05:50.449
Now you give it a shot,
Princess.

05:50.451 --> 05:51.983
Show me what you got!

05:51.985 --> 05:53.885
Like this?

05:53.887 --> 05:56.455
Ha ha ha ha!

05:56.457 --> 05:58.757
Not bad for a beginner.

06:03.063 --> 06:04.863
Where's Princess Sofia?

06:04.865 --> 06:06.665
Oh, Sofia. She's busy.

06:06.667 --> 06:09.067
So we brought
Clover!

06:09.069 --> 06:10.802
He's Sofia's best friend.

06:10.804 --> 06:12.137
This is Halt.

06:12.139 --> 06:13.972
Are you a Protector too?

06:13.974 --> 06:17.175
[laughs] Am I a Protector too?

06:17.177 --> 06:19.544
Let's just say
I've worked with Sofia before

06:19.546 --> 06:20.979
on this kind of hero-type stuff,

06:20.981 --> 06:22.914
so yeah. What's the problem?

06:22.916 --> 06:24.916
Well, some Wee Sprites
showed up

06:24.918 --> 06:26.184
and took over our tree.

06:26.186 --> 06:27.252
Wee Sprites?

06:27.254 --> 06:28.587
They said they were run off

06:28.589 --> 06:30.555
the Isle of Wee Sprites
by birds.

06:30.557 --> 06:33.992
In any case, the Wee Sprites
are causing mischief
and won't leave!

06:33.994 --> 06:36.695
Sofia and I tangled
with Wee Sprites before.

06:36.697 --> 06:40.999
I got this. The trick is
to get them to say
they want to leave.

06:41.001 --> 06:43.935
-[loud thud]
-Okay, w-w-what's that?

06:43.937 --> 06:46.104
Oh, that's just the Rompkins.
They're our neighbors.

06:46.106 --> 06:47.906
They have this big party
every year.

06:47.908 --> 06:50.108
[whimpers] Rompkin Romp.

06:50.110 --> 06:51.243
Right. Rompkins.

06:51.245 --> 06:53.111
What about
our Wee Sprite problem?

06:53.113 --> 06:54.880
Wee Sprites. No problem.

06:54.882 --> 06:57.115
I'm gonna take care of it
for you. No sweat.

06:57.117 --> 07:00.118
Before you know it,
you'll be singin' my praises.

07:00.120 --> 07:02.754
Actually, a song in my honor
would be nice.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.356
Could you work on that?

07:04.358 --> 07:06.358
-A song?
-About my bravery.

07:06.360 --> 07:08.760
My skill. You know,
something like...

07:08.762 --> 07:10.128
brump, bump-bum.

07:10.130 --> 07:11.630
¶ Ballad of the Bravest Bunny ¶

07:11.632 --> 07:13.031
Or something like that.

07:13.033 --> 07:14.766
And the pie that
we discussed earlier.

07:14.768 --> 07:16.067
Okay, I guess.

07:16.069 --> 07:18.570
All right, all right.
Clover's on it!

07:18.572 --> 07:20.539
He seems so brave!

07:20.541 --> 07:22.441
He seems
so hungry.

07:22.443 --> 07:24.943
Well, he's dealt
with Wee Sprites before.

07:24.945 --> 07:26.745
What choice do we have?

07:26.747 --> 07:28.647
"Bravest Bunny"? Ha!

07:28.649 --> 07:31.049
I'm gonna find us
a real Protector!

07:34.455 --> 07:36.621
It's, uh....

07:36.623 --> 07:38.023
a little tight.

07:42.062 --> 07:43.628
[crash]

07:45.165 --> 07:47.065
Who are you?

07:47.067 --> 07:48.567
And why are you
in our tree?

07:48.569 --> 07:50.068
And where'd you get
those ears?

07:50.070 --> 07:51.303
Did you lose a bet?

07:51.305 --> 07:53.405
Lose a bet?
No, I'm a rabbit!

07:53.407 --> 07:56.608
Look, the Hoodwinks
asked me to get you
out of their tree.

07:56.610 --> 07:59.010
Oh, we're not leavin'.
We like it here.

07:59.012 --> 08:02.180
Mm-hmm. It's cozy,
and new, and fun!

08:02.182 --> 08:03.415
Look, guys.

08:03.417 --> 08:05.283
Whaddya say we just
skip to the part

08:05.285 --> 08:06.952
where you say you want to leave,

08:06.954 --> 08:08.753
and then magically...

08:08.755 --> 08:10.956
float out of here. Okay?

08:10.958 --> 08:13.091
Mmm...we can't do that.

08:13.093 --> 08:16.261
We need a place
to crash. And trash.

08:16.263 --> 08:19.197
Besides, our Isle
is completely infested
with Badger Birds.

08:19.199 --> 08:22.033
Do you know how annoying
Badger Birds are?

08:22.035 --> 08:24.870
So, so annoying! They are, like,
more annoying than us, even.

08:24.872 --> 08:28.006
-The point is,
we're staying.
-For good.

08:28.008 --> 08:30.141
But I told the Hoodwinks
I'd get you out!

08:30.143 --> 08:31.877
Isn't there somewhere else
you can go?

08:31.879 --> 08:34.446
Where else are we gonna
find a place that's this fun?

08:34.448 --> 08:37.282
Uhhh.

08:39.853 --> 08:41.152
First time
I've ever seen that.

08:41.154 --> 08:42.888
Aaah!

08:45.125 --> 08:46.725
Oops! I'm sorry.

08:46.727 --> 08:48.627
I'm fine, I'm fine.

08:48.629 --> 08:51.029
[Chrysta] A Hoodwink?
What are you doing here?

08:51.031 --> 08:53.465
-I'm afraid
we need assistance.
-What's the problem?

08:53.467 --> 08:56.001
I think it would be easier
if I showed you. Will you come?

08:56.003 --> 08:59.371
There's already a Protector
there--a rabbit--
but I don't trust him.

08:59.373 --> 09:00.906
A rabbit Protector?

09:00.908 --> 09:02.374
I didn't know
there was one of those.

09:02.376 --> 09:04.142
Uh, there isn't.

09:04.144 --> 09:06.177
Clover is his name?

09:06.179 --> 09:07.245
Clover?

09:07.247 --> 09:09.548
Gray fur? Floppy ears?
Adorable?

09:09.550 --> 09:12.350
-That's the one.
-But he's not a Protector.

09:12.352 --> 09:13.885
I knew it!

09:13.887 --> 09:15.887
You go check it out,
Sofia.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.188
We'll finish training later.

09:17.190 --> 09:18.957
Just call if you need any help.

09:29.336 --> 09:31.169
You know what?
You stay here.

09:31.171 --> 09:32.737
I'm goin'
to the Rompkin Romp.

09:32.739 --> 09:35.106
The who-kins what?

09:35.108 --> 09:41.179
[laughs] The Rompkin Romp?
Never heard of it?

09:41.415 --> 09:42.948
Oh, yeah,
the big fellas down there
are having a huge party.

09:42.950 --> 09:44.082
The biggest in
all the Mystic Isles.

09:44.084 --> 09:45.951
Everyone's goin'.

09:47.187 --> 09:49.287
Okay, see ya, little guys.

09:49.289 --> 09:51.122
[grunting]

09:51.124 --> 09:52.791
I'm headed to
all the fun, fun, fun!

09:52.793 --> 09:54.025
Whoop?

09:55.195 --> 09:57.696
Oh, I do like a good party.

09:57.698 --> 09:59.464
I wanna go!
Let's go!

09:59.466 --> 10:01.299
We don't wanna be
in this tree anymore!

10:01.301 --> 10:02.367
Ha!

10:15.248 --> 10:17.549
And..you're welcome.

10:17.551 --> 10:20.318
[all chanting]
Clover! Clover! Clover!

10:20.320 --> 10:21.886
Oh, you're too kind.
You're too kind.

10:21.888 --> 10:24.255
-[chanting continues]
-But don't stop. Ever.

10:24.257 --> 10:26.558
Clover! Clover!

10:26.560 --> 10:29.127
That was so fantastic!

10:29.129 --> 10:31.129
You got our home back!

10:31.131 --> 10:32.731
To thank you
for being our hero,

10:32.733 --> 10:34.299
we flew over
to the Isle of Fairies

10:34.301 --> 10:36.434
and got you
some sugar-plum pies!

10:36.436 --> 10:38.536
Pies? Plural?

10:39.940 --> 10:41.206
Gotta love that.

10:43.910 --> 10:46.444
Ahem. Clover?

10:46.446 --> 10:48.780
Aah! S-Sof!
It's you!

10:48.782 --> 10:50.248
What are you doing here?

10:50.250 --> 10:52.917
Uh, I'm...
I'm glad you asked me that,

10:52.919 --> 10:56.321
because the Hoodwinks
have been working on a song

10:56.323 --> 10:58.089
about that very thing.

10:58.091 --> 10:59.457
-Right, guys?
-Right!

10:59.459 --> 11:02.594
A song for the best, bravest,

11:02.596 --> 11:06.364
bunniest hero of all time!

11:06.366 --> 11:10.969
¶¶

11:10.971 --> 11:12.537
¶ He's a bunny ¶

11:12.539 --> 11:16.307
¶ Who laughs in
the face of trouble ¶

11:16.309 --> 11:21.613
Just call his name and he'll
be there on the double ¶

11:21.615 --> 11:24.616
¶ He's got no doubt or fear ¶

11:24.618 --> 11:27.352
¶ From his fuzzy tail
to his floppy ears ¶

11:27.354 --> 11:31.856
¶ He's the boldest,
bravest bunny of all time ¶

11:31.858 --> 11:34.859
¶ His name is Clover ¶

11:34.861 --> 11:37.562
¶ He's brave all over ¶

11:37.564 --> 11:39.664
¶ If you've got yourself
a problem ¶

11:39.666 --> 11:44.602
¶ He's the rabbit
you should call ¶

11:46.640 --> 11:51.976
¶ At first he looked like
he might be a zero ¶

11:51.978 --> 11:57.315
¶ But he turned out
to be the Hoodwinks' hero ¶

11:57.317 --> 11:59.751
¶ He got the Wee Sprites out ¶

11:59.753 --> 12:02.654
¶ So for us there really
is no doubt ¶

12:02.656 --> 12:07.325
¶ He's the boldest, bravest
bunny of all time ¶

12:07.327 --> 12:10.228
¶ His name is Clover ¶

12:10.230 --> 12:13.231
¶ He's brave all over ¶

12:13.233 --> 12:15.333
¶ If you've got yourself
a problem ¶

12:15.335 --> 12:18.670
¶ He's the rabbit
you should call ¶

12:18.672 --> 12:21.439
¶ He's fearless, true and smart
and kind of funny ¶

12:21.441 --> 12:24.909
¶ That's why I want to be
just like that bunny ¶

12:24.911 --> 12:27.345
¶ To me, he can do no wrong ¶

12:27.347 --> 12:30.014
¶ Which is why
I wrote this song ¶

12:30.016 --> 12:35.453
¶ I'm the number one fan
of the number one superstar ¶

12:35.455 --> 12:41.059
[Clover]
¶ Sofia's great and you know
I really respect her ¶

12:41.061 --> 12:42.594
¶ But if you can't get her ¶

12:42.596 --> 12:46.464
¶ Then I'm your
furry protector ¶

12:46.466 --> 12:49.234
¶ I will come right
to your aid ¶

12:49.236 --> 12:51.903
¶ For some pies
and maybe a parade ¶

12:51.905 --> 12:56.474
¶ I'm the boldest, bravest
bunny of all time ¶

12:56.476 --> 12:59.244
[Hoodwink chorus]
¶ His name is Clover ¶

12:59.246 --> 13:02.247
¶ He's brave all over ¶

13:02.249 --> 13:04.415
¶ If you've got yourself
a problem ¶

13:04.417 --> 13:06.117
¶ He's the rabbit
you should call ¶

13:06.119 --> 13:08.386
[Clover] Now ya got it!
That's right!

13:08.388 --> 13:10.755
¶ 'Cause I'm the boldest,
bravest bunny ¶

13:10.757 --> 13:16.361
¶ Of all ¶

13:18.765 --> 13:20.398
-[distant crashing]
-[Sofia gasps]

13:20.400 --> 13:22.567
That doesn't sound good!

13:22.569 --> 13:24.302
[distant thud]

13:24.304 --> 13:26.971
Clover? How did you
get the Wee Sprites

13:26.973 --> 13:28.773
to say they want to leave?

13:28.775 --> 13:30.942
Little bit of this,
little bit of that--

13:30.944 --> 13:32.410
the usual.

13:32.412 --> 13:34.913
-Hmm. Oh, no.
-[ruckus in distance]

13:34.915 --> 13:37.081
It sounds like the Rompkins
are in trouble.

13:37.083 --> 13:38.216
Come on!

13:39.853 --> 13:42.520
[loud crashing]

13:42.522 --> 13:43.988
[crashing continues]

13:43.990 --> 13:45.757
Harumph!
What's going on?

13:45.759 --> 13:48.193
Princess Sofia, help us!

13:48.195 --> 13:49.861
We're scared of the monsters!

13:49.863 --> 13:51.930
Monsters?

13:55.335 --> 13:57.468
You mean the Wee Sprites?

13:57.470 --> 14:00.138
Oh, yeah!
They are wee in size,

14:00.140 --> 14:03.341
but crash-bang huge
in trouble-making!

14:03.343 --> 14:05.944
Clover. Did you get
the Wee Sprites

14:05.946 --> 14:08.346
out of the Hoodwinks' tree
by having them come over here?

14:08.348 --> 14:11.482
[laughs] Maybe.

14:11.484 --> 14:13.618
-Ahh, Clover!
-[Harumph] They showed up

14:13.620 --> 14:15.053
and we invited them in

14:15.055 --> 14:17.222
because they were fun and nice,

14:17.224 --> 14:19.991
and then--Boom!--they were not.

14:19.993 --> 14:22.193
We've been so dainty,

14:22.195 --> 14:24.629
but now it's all ruined.

14:24.631 --> 14:27.165
Ohh. Harumph, I'm sorry.

14:27.167 --> 14:29.701
Clover can fix it.
He's a big hero!

14:29.703 --> 14:31.803
How are you gonna fix it,
Clover?

14:31.805 --> 14:33.538
Uh--Um--

14:33.540 --> 14:35.206
L-Let me think on that.

14:35.208 --> 14:37.408
-[crashing]
-Hello? Wee Sprites?

14:37.410 --> 14:38.910
Hello?

14:38.912 --> 14:40.345
And you are...who?

14:40.347 --> 14:41.913
I'm Sofia. I'm friends

14:41.915 --> 14:43.414
with some Wee Sprites
in the EverRealm.

14:43.416 --> 14:44.983
Brody, Benji, and Button?

14:44.985 --> 14:47.385
What, you think all Wee Sprites
know each other?

14:47.387 --> 14:49.988
Actually, Button
is my cousin.

14:49.990 --> 14:52.023
So, I was thinking

14:52.025 --> 14:54.659
as a favor to a friend
of a cousin,

14:54.661 --> 14:56.828
maybe you could
stop making mischief?

14:56.830 --> 14:59.998
-We're Wee Sprites.
-Mischief is kind of our thing.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.200
Then why aren't you doing it
on your own Isle?

15:02.202 --> 15:04.702
Ohh! We already explained this
to the bunny!

15:04.704 --> 15:07.572
We had to get out of there
because of the Badger Birds.

15:07.574 --> 15:09.440
Hey! There's Floppy Ears!

15:09.442 --> 15:12.343
Hey, you were right.
It's way more fun here!

15:12.345 --> 15:14.245
Ohh. I knew it. Clover,

15:14.247 --> 15:16.281
you didn't fix
the Hoodwink's problem,

15:16.283 --> 15:18.082
you just moved it over here.

15:18.084 --> 15:20.551
I guess I didn't
think about that. Heh.

15:20.553 --> 15:22.287
But you're gonna fix it,
right?

15:22.289 --> 15:25.356
Right. I'll send the Wee Sprites
somewhere else,

15:25.358 --> 15:26.925
like, uh, like up there.

15:26.927 --> 15:28.359
[Sofia]
The Isle of Fairies?

15:28.361 --> 15:29.727
That's not solving it,

15:29.729 --> 15:32.130
that's must making it
someone else's problem again.

15:32.132 --> 15:34.866
-Then what do we do?
-We have to get to
the root of the problem.

15:34.868 --> 15:36.601
We'll go to
the Isle of Wee Sprites

15:36.603 --> 15:38.536
and figure out why
the Badger Birds
chased them off.

15:38.538 --> 15:41.472
If we fix that,
then the Wee Sprites
can go back home

15:41.474 --> 15:42.607
and everybody's happy.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.208
I'm coming too!

15:44.210 --> 15:47.545
I want to see my hero
in action again!

15:50.617 --> 15:53.551
Nobody's home.
This is kind of spooky.

15:54.454 --> 15:55.620
[birds clucking]

15:55.622 --> 15:57.488
Those must be
the Badger Birds.

15:57.490 --> 15:59.657
They can't be so bad.
They're tiny.

15:59.659 --> 16:01.726
[birds shrieking]
Hi! Hi! Hi! Hi! Hi! Hi! Hi!

16:01.728 --> 16:03.928
I was wrong!
They're bad!

16:03.930 --> 16:06.297
Shoo, birds!

16:06.299 --> 16:07.298
Get off me!

16:07.300 --> 16:09.133
[cawing continues]

16:09.135 --> 16:10.134
Shoo! Whoa!

16:10.136 --> 16:11.202
Huh.

16:20.981 --> 16:24.349
Follow me! That won't
hold them off for long!

16:24.351 --> 16:26.250
I wish for us to be small.

16:28.121 --> 16:30.655
[Clover] Yo, look!
I'm so tiny!

16:37.664 --> 16:40.531
Wow. I see why
the Wee Sprites left.

16:40.533 --> 16:42.934
Those birds give "annoying"
a bad name!

16:42.936 --> 16:46.671
Thanks for saving us. I'm Sofia,
and this is Hidey and Clover.

16:47.774 --> 16:50.375
-[loud buzzing]
-Ahh-ha-ha-ha!

16:50.377 --> 16:52.343
I'm Buzzer.
Nice to meetcha.

16:52.345 --> 16:55.513
Oh, sorry.
Pranks are sort of my hobby.

16:55.515 --> 16:57.782
I make prank potions,
prank powders,

16:57.784 --> 16:59.150
prank-potion-y powders,

16:59.152 --> 17:00.485
potion-y prank potions--

17:00.487 --> 17:01.719
Why are you still here?

17:01.721 --> 17:03.821
Aren't you afraid
of those birds?

17:03.823 --> 17:05.990
Yeah, they are
a bit of a nuisance.

17:05.992 --> 17:08.559
Yes, that's what I get
for bringing 'em here.

17:08.561 --> 17:10.661
[gasps]
You brought them here?!

17:10.663 --> 17:13.698
Just one.
From the Isle
of Magical Birds.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.666
I couldn't help it.
I mean, what's funnier

17:15.668 --> 17:17.668
than a really annoying bird?

17:17.670 --> 17:19.370
I can think of a few things.

17:19.372 --> 17:22.640
Well, my one little Badger Bird
did its "Hi! Hi! Hi!" thing,

17:22.642 --> 17:24.575
and oh, how we laughed!

17:24.577 --> 17:27.211
And then I got
this great idea:

17:27.213 --> 17:29.547
What if there were
more than one?

17:29.549 --> 17:31.482
So I dunked it in
this cloning potion.

17:31.484 --> 17:34.752
Now there's two,
which is a hoot!

17:34.754 --> 17:37.188
But then they slipped
out of my hands
and went for a little swim,

17:37.190 --> 17:40.258
and they just started
multiplying!

17:40.260 --> 17:42.927
Next thing I know,
there's a whole flock of 'em.

17:42.929 --> 17:46.030
All the other Wee Sprites
couldn't take it, and left!

17:46.032 --> 17:47.565
But you stayed behind?

17:47.567 --> 17:50.568
Well, I kinda feel responsible.

17:50.570 --> 17:52.837
It was just supposed
to be a little prank.

17:52.839 --> 17:56.441
It's okay, Buzzer.
I think I can help you.
I'm a Protector.

17:56.443 --> 17:58.376
Me too!

17:58.378 --> 18:02.180
Now, if we just had something
to attract the Badger Birds...

18:05.518 --> 18:06.884
Savor leaves!

18:06.886 --> 18:08.619
Badger Birds
can't resist 'em.

18:08.621 --> 18:11.522
Okay, then, I'll use the leaves
to trap them,

18:11.524 --> 18:13.624
and then bring them back
to the Isle of Magical Birds.

18:13.626 --> 18:15.860
And what are you
gonna do, Clover?

18:15.862 --> 18:17.595
Something heroic, right?

18:17.597 --> 18:20.364
Something super-spectacular?

18:20.366 --> 18:22.100
Oh, you'll see. You--

18:22.102 --> 18:24.802
You're gonna want to throw me
the biggest parade ever.

18:24.804 --> 18:27.071
Oh! I can't wait!

18:27.073 --> 18:29.474
Now, how do we
get their attention?

18:29.476 --> 18:31.843
Leave that to me.

18:33.046 --> 18:34.779
Come on and get it,
Badger Birds!

18:34.781 --> 18:36.414
I got the leaves ya like!

18:36.416 --> 18:37.615
Clover, wait!

18:37.617 --> 18:39.083
[birds]
Hi! Hi! Hi! Hi! Hi! Hi!

18:39.085 --> 18:40.718
[Clover] Incoming!

18:40.720 --> 18:42.887
[birds continue squawking]

18:46.126 --> 18:49.994
Ah! Let the parade begin!

18:49.996 --> 18:53.564
-Clover, you did it!
-You did it, all right.

18:53.566 --> 18:55.633
You trapped 'em in my house
with the cloning potion!

18:55.635 --> 18:57.835
Oh, no!
You mean they're--

18:57.837 --> 18:59.003
Multiplying!!!

18:59.005 --> 19:00.805
Over and over and over again!

19:00.807 --> 19:03.107
Clover, that wasn't the plan.

19:03.109 --> 19:04.775
Why did you do that?

19:04.777 --> 19:05.977
I don't know.

19:05.979 --> 19:08.813
I guess I just wanted
to be like you, Sofia.

19:08.815 --> 19:12.083
Be the hero.
Get the rewards...

19:12.085 --> 19:13.985
I don't do this for rewards.

19:13.987 --> 19:15.920
Or parades. Or pies.

19:15.922 --> 19:17.622
I do it because
I want to help.

19:17.624 --> 19:19.090
[Clover] Ohh.

19:19.092 --> 19:21.859
Don't worry. I'm sure
Clover has an idea.

19:21.861 --> 19:25.429
You've probably been through
lots of tough situations
like this,

19:25.431 --> 19:26.531
right, Clover?

19:26.533 --> 19:29.167
I...I don't know, Hidey.

19:29.169 --> 19:31.669
I'm not sure I am
who you think I am.

19:31.671 --> 19:33.337
You're a big hero.

19:33.339 --> 19:34.705
I'm not a hero.

19:34.707 --> 19:36.541
And I'm no Protector.

19:36.543 --> 19:39.510
I'm...I'm just
a plain old bunny.

19:39.512 --> 19:43.347
Ohh. Guess
I don't need these anymore.

19:44.784 --> 19:47.685
Clover, you're not
a plain old bunny.

19:47.687 --> 19:51.355
Yes, I am. I'm nothin'
but Badger Bird bait.

19:51.357 --> 19:53.357
Don't say that.

19:53.359 --> 19:56.060
Just focus on how we can
get those birds out of there
and capture them.

19:56.062 --> 19:57.962
Okay. Let's see...

19:57.964 --> 19:59.730
I guess we should
build a trap,

19:59.732 --> 20:00.898
like you were probably
gonna do

20:00.900 --> 20:02.833
before I messed everything up.

20:02.835 --> 20:04.869
Oh. Here! We can use this!

20:04.871 --> 20:06.871
We get them to
fly over the trap,

20:06.873 --> 20:08.306
and then cinch 'em right up.

20:08.308 --> 20:10.174
I'll just get a little rope
to tie if off.

20:10.176 --> 20:12.743
And then I'll open the door
and let all the birds out.

20:12.745 --> 20:14.145
But you'll get swarmed!

20:14.147 --> 20:17.148
-I have to try.
-No, Sof. I have to.

20:17.150 --> 20:18.916
You saw how quick I was before.

20:18.918 --> 20:20.585
I'm the only one
who can open the door

20:20.587 --> 20:22.753
and still get out of the way
of that swarm.

20:22.755 --> 20:25.756
Clover, you don't have
to prove to anyone
that you're a hero.

20:28.494 --> 20:29.827
Yes, I do.

20:29.829 --> 20:31.395
I have to prove it to myself.

20:31.397 --> 20:33.397
You just be ready
with that trap.

20:33.399 --> 20:35.967
Okay. But be careful.

20:38.605 --> 20:40.071
Trap's ready!

20:40.073 --> 20:41.906
I wish to be big again.

20:44.043 --> 20:46.777
The trap is all set!

20:52.452 --> 20:54.552
Clover! Over here!

20:54.554 --> 20:57.455
Come on and get it,
Badger Birds!

20:57.457 --> 21:00.124
Sofia! Do your thing!

21:00.126 --> 21:01.959
Hurry!

21:01.961 --> 21:04.629
Ohhh...

21:04.631 --> 21:06.697
-Aah!
-Got 'em!

21:06.699 --> 21:08.232
Clover, you did it!

21:08.234 --> 21:10.268
Well, I guess I did.

21:10.270 --> 21:13.037
Clover!
That was so brave!

21:13.039 --> 21:14.739
You are a hero!

21:14.741 --> 21:16.907
I'm gonna throw you
the biggest parade ever

21:16.909 --> 21:18.776
in the history of forever!

21:18.778 --> 21:21.279
Okay, then.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.781
First, we take these guys back
to the Isle of Magical Birds.

21:23.783 --> 21:27.818
Then we go tell the Wee Sprites
the good news.

21:27.820 --> 21:29.954
[Babble] You mean,
we can go home?

21:29.956 --> 21:31.956
[Buzzer] Thanks to
these two heroes over here,

21:31.958 --> 21:33.991
the Badger Birds are gone!

21:33.993 --> 21:36.427
And I solemnly promise
never to clone

21:36.429 --> 21:38.763
such an annoying bird
ever again!

21:38.765 --> 21:40.131
It'll be good to go home.

21:40.133 --> 21:41.966
We don't want
to stay here anymore.

21:41.968 --> 21:44.168
We wanna go to
the Isle of Wee Sprites!

21:44.170 --> 21:46.737
Yeah, let's go!
It's about time.

21:46.739 --> 21:48.806
Yeah, we broke everything here.

21:48.808 --> 21:51.008
Bye, Rompkins!
Don't forget to write!

21:51.010 --> 21:54.745
Bye! Never come back!

21:54.747 --> 21:56.814
Bye!

22:00.420 --> 22:02.920
Clover, we have
something for you.

22:02.922 --> 22:04.689
We heard what you did up there,

22:04.691 --> 22:08.192
and we want you to have
this award of valor.

22:08.194 --> 22:10.194
Ohh. Thanks.

22:10.196 --> 22:11.829
But Sofia should
get this.

22:11.831 --> 22:13.764
She's the real Protector.

22:13.766 --> 22:15.199
I couldn't have
done it without her.

22:15.201 --> 22:18.202
Maybe, but you're our Protector.

22:21.641 --> 22:23.874
Aww. I'll never
take it off.

22:25.845 --> 22:29.714
Like I said, you'll always
be my hero, Clover.

22:36.723 --> 22:40.191
