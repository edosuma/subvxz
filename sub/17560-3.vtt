I'm sorry, I was just
trying to help you.

And by the way,
that accent is way less cute

02:41.494 --> 02:43.580

Holly, I appreciate
you trying to help me

02:45.290 --> 02:46.416
but you're a little pushy

02:46.499 --> 02:48.126
and that's just not
the way I do things.

you're gonna be late

you're just getting home.

Well, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna get going.

Wait. We have not
finished our fight.

Oh, alright.
Uh, you were wrong.

03:01.389 --> 03:02.891
You're sorry about butting
into my career

03:02.974 --> 03:04.601
and you'll never
do it again, sorry.

Ooh, without Lauren?

03:16.154 --> 03:18.948
Okay, look, I am sorry
her wedding didn't happen

03:19.032 --> 03:21.367
but she won't let me
plan anything.

03:21.451 --> 03:24.329

her florist, her song.

You know I'm not
a good confronter.

03:33.087 --> 03:35.548
Just talking about confronting
makes me uncomfortable.

03:35.632 --> 03:36.966
Well, you want me to tell her?

03:37.050 --> 03:39.636

I'm a pushy biatch.

getting a three-hour massage.

about the centerpieces.

Uh, romance through the ages.

04:10.750 --> 04:13.920

of Romeo and Juliet

04:15.421 --> 04:17.966
and at the head table,
Ross and Rachel.

Ooh, what do you think
about that, Val?

04:22.929 --> 04:25.098
Tell Lauren
what you think about that.

04:26.599 --> 04:27.600
Okay.

Lauren, look, uh,
about these cutouts

um, I just don't like..

04:34.274 --> 04:36.859
I just don't like that..

Hey, so, Lauren,
isn't it true at your wedding

04:46.369 --> 04:49.205

from the ceiling on a heart?

04:49.288 --> 04:51.124
Mm-hmm.

Hey, don't you have to go
take a shower, pushy biatch?

04:56.295 --> 05:00.216
Yes, and I need money
for school books, wussy biatch.

05:02.427 --> 05:04.804
I'm just gonna go
get my checkbook.

05:06.806 --> 05:08.224
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:08.307 --> 05:10.393
- Is Val around?
- Yeah, she's upstairs.

05:10.476 --> 05:12.895
Okay, then we don't have much
time. Look, I really need you--

05:12.979 --> 05:15.064
Ha! Oh, God.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.692
Well, I knew
this was gonna happen.

05:17.775 --> 05:19.402
Let me make it
very clear, mister.

05:19.485 --> 05:21.529
You and I aren't, okay?

05:21.612 --> 05:23.322
Val is, uh, my best friend

05:23.406 --> 05:25.450
and, honey, mama don't play
that game.

05:27.076 --> 05:28.745
Yeah, uh, Lauren,
I was just gonna ask you

05:28.828 --> 05:30.621
to help me pick out
Val's engagement ring.

05:30.705 --> 05:33.416
Yeah, I know,
but mama don't got no life.

05:41.591 --> 05:45.636
Now, this one says "Fat or bald,
you're gettin' lucky."

05:47.180 --> 05:49.515
I'm not sure it's Val.
Maybe I should keep looking.

05:53.686 --> 05:54.854
Hello.

05:57.815 --> 05:58.983
Oh, hi.

05:59.067 --> 06:01.611
I'm sorry for staring,
it's just..

06:01.694 --> 06:03.446
My therapist says
there's something wrong with me

06:03.529 --> 06:06.115
because I only fall
for married women.

06:06.199 --> 06:09.243
Oh, how unfortunate..

06:09.327 --> 06:11.871
...for my husband.

06:11.954 --> 06:14.957
- I'm Todd.
- I'm Lauren.

06:15.041 --> 06:17.085
Mrs. Lauren.

06:17.168 --> 06:18.753
Mrs. Ralph Lauren.

06:20.213 --> 06:22.173
How long have you
and your husband been married?

06:22.256 --> 06:24.383
- Ten years.
- That's hot.

06:26.052 --> 06:29.097
Ten happy, happy years.

06:29.180 --> 06:31.307
Oh, God.

06:31.390 --> 06:32.892
Are you sure
that's the right one?

06:32.975 --> 06:34.769
Oh, it is just perfect.

06:34.852 --> 06:38.606
You're only the best husband
ever, Mr. Ralph Lauren.

06:48.491 --> 06:50.535
Oh, look, what he's doing.

06:53.579 --> 06:55.748
Yeah, he's having
your breakfast.

06:57.542 --> 06:59.836
I hate that guy.
I hate that he's with her.

06:59.919 --> 07:01.671
I hate that he's living with me.

07:01.754 --> 07:04.549
I hate that I'm turning
into a chick.

07:04.632 --> 07:05.925
Turning?

07:06.008 --> 07:07.844
Man, if I have to hear
you cry yourself to sleep

07:07.927 --> 07:10.138
one more night,
I'm gonna buy you some panties.

07:12.557 --> 07:14.142
Hey, hey, hey.

07:14.225 --> 07:15.685
- Hi, guys.
- Alright, well, I'm gonna go.

07:15.768 --> 07:17.812
I need to get some more
CDs in the mail.

07:17.895 --> 07:19.730
But, uh, if we're gonna start
making up like this

07:19.814 --> 07:22.108
I see another fight coming on.

07:25.570 --> 07:27.488
I'll see you later, mate.

07:30.783 --> 07:34.203
So what are you guys fighting
about? Gary wants to know.

07:34.287 --> 07:36.414
Well, Ben and I went to,
like, 20 clubs

07:36.497 --> 07:38.916
trying to get his CD heard,
but nobody would listen.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.878
- Why? Is it that bad?
- No, it's awesome.

07:41.961 --> 07:43.921
But Ben has his own way
of doing things.

07:44.005 --> 07:45.173
Wait, did you guys go to Skids?

07:45.256 --> 07:46.841
- I know the owner.
- You do?

07:46.924 --> 07:48.384
Yeah, me and Omar used
to be real cool.

07:48.467 --> 07:49.719
I can give him
Ben's CD for you.

07:49.802 --> 07:53.639
Oh, ho, ho, well,
isn't that nice of Gary?

07:53.723 --> 07:56.642

my ex-girlfriend's boyfriend.

07:58.227 --> 08:00.980
What a good guy.

08:01.063 --> 08:03.316
Ow.

08:03.399 --> 08:04.817
That's perfect.

08:04.901 --> 08:06.652
Okay, so all you have to do
is get me in to see Omar

08:06.736 --> 08:09.739
and then I'll bring him a CD.
Wait, what am I doing?

08:09.822 --> 08:11.282
I just promised Ben
I wouldn't do that.

08:11.365 --> 08:14.285
I can't do that.
I won't do that.

08:14.368 --> 08:15.995
Look at what you're doing.

08:16.078 --> 08:17.705
I was just sitting there
innocently

08:17.788 --> 08:19.749
and then you told me you knew
the owner of a club.

08:19.832 --> 08:21.250
What was I to do?

08:21.334 --> 08:24.670
Wow, how can such a little girl
be full of so much crap?

08:27.131 --> 08:28.132
Oh, look, there's the owner.

08:28.216 --> 08:29.800
Introduce me
and then step aside.

08:29.884 --> 08:31.928
- Step aside?
- Yeah, Gary, please.

08:32.010 --> 08:34.388
Ben and I have been to, like,
20 clubs in the past week.

08:34.472 --> 08:37.642
I know how to speak
the language.

08:37.725 --> 08:39.101
- Omar, what's up, dog?
- Hey.

08:39.184 --> 08:40.602
- How you doing?
- Pretty good.

08:40.686 --> 08:42.020
Hey, listen, I want you
to meet a friend of mine.

08:42.104 --> 08:43.481
This is Holly Tyler.

08:43.563 --> 08:46.275
Yo, dog,
Holly-T in the heezy.

08:46.359 --> 08:51.614
Groovy, another white girl
from the suburbs in the heezy.

08:51.697 --> 08:54.951
Listen, Omar, Merry Christmas,
I just brought you a present.

08:55.034 --> 08:56.827
His name is Ben Sheffield.
He's--

08:56.911 --> 08:58.371
- Gary?
- He's good.

08:58.454 --> 09:02.208
Okay, Tuesday night
I try out new talent. $500.

09:02.291 --> 09:05.086
He won't do it
for less than six.

09:05.169 --> 09:06.254
Gary.

09:06.337 --> 09:08.798
Look, Holly, uh,
he's not gonna pay Ben.

09:08.881 --> 09:11.801
He-he wants you to pay him $500.

09:11.884 --> 09:13.386
[chuckles]

09:13.469 --> 09:17.848
Why would I pay you
to have my talent sing here?

09:17.932 --> 09:21.310
Okay, first of all,
personal space.

09:23.062 --> 09:26.107
Second of all,
the $500 is a deposit.

09:26.190 --> 09:29.068
If you get 50 people in here,
$10 a head

09:29.151 --> 09:30.361
you get your $500 back.

09:30.444 --> 09:32.363
But then Ben makes nothing.

09:32.446 --> 09:34.573
This is me caring.

09:36.659 --> 09:38.911
Well, I'm not interested.

09:40.538 --> 09:41.956
Holly, he's not
coming after you.

09:42.039 --> 09:43.958
In that case,
I will take that nothing

09:44.041 --> 09:46.127
and pay you $500.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.005
You don't have $500.

09:49.088 --> 09:52.800
But I do have a blank check
from my sister for school books.

09:52.883 --> 09:54.969
Oh, sookie sookie now.

10:00.683 --> 10:01.726
[knock on door]

10:01.809 --> 10:03.227
I'll get it. No, no, no,
I wanna get it.

10:03.311 --> 10:04.895
I wanna get it. It's for me.
It's for me. It's for me.

10:04.979 --> 10:06.981
It's for me.
I bet it's Ben with good news.

10:07.064 --> 10:09.108
- I've got good news.
- I knew it.

10:09.191 --> 10:11.027
You won't believe it.
The owner of Skids called.

10:11.110 --> 10:12.820
He got my CD in the mail
and he booked me on--

10:12.903 --> 10:15.364
- Tuesday night?
- Yes, how did you know that?

Because Tuesday's
the best night.

10:17.867 --> 10:19.285
Yay! Oh!

10:19.368 --> 10:22.496
Oh, my God, isn't he amazing?
You guys have to come.

10:22.580 --> 10:25.124
But I mean, seriously,
you have to come.

10:25.207 --> 10:28.336
And if you could bring, like,
everybody you've ever met?

10:28.419 --> 10:30.546
- I can bring Todd.
- Who's Todd?

10:30.629 --> 10:33.758
Todd is this fabulous guy I met
who only dates married women.

10:33.841 --> 10:35.926
Mm-hmm. I'm cheating
on my husband with him.

10:37.261 --> 10:38.929
Lauren, you're not married.

10:39.013 --> 10:41.349
Now, there's a sentence
I don't hear enough.

Ooh, it's Todd,
my twisted lover.

10:47.980 --> 10:50.733
Rick, hi. Yes,
everything is taken care of.

10:50.816 --> 10:53.736
The ring is sized and I hid it
in the perfect place.

10:53.819 --> 10:57.740
- Aah! I found the ring!
- Okay, bye-bye now.

10:57.823 --> 10:59.992
Oh, my God, that must be
the engagement ring.

11:00.076 --> 11:02.578
I know, but why would he hide it
in such a stupid place?

11:02.661 --> 11:06.248
Well, maybe he thought
it was a clever place.

11:06.332 --> 11:08.542
Maybe he thought what bride
would be stupid enough

11:08.626 --> 11:10.878
to raid a cookie jar
two months before her wedding?

11:12.755 --> 11:13.964
Okay, let me see it.
Let me see.

11:14.048 --> 11:15.341
No, no, no.
I can't open it.

11:15.424 --> 11:17.718
Y-yeah, you can. It's easy.

11:17.802 --> 11:20.096
O-pen.

11:20.179 --> 11:21.138
- Okay.
- Yay.

- Okay.

11:35.444 --> 11:37.947
Oh, my God. It's..

11:38.030 --> 11:39.073
It's..

11:39.156 --> 11:40.366
(both)
Hideous.

11:42.701 --> 11:45.246
It's like a car wreck.
We should just walk away.

11:46.580 --> 11:48.457
I don't get it,
this does not look like

11:48.541 --> 11:49.917
something Rick would pick out.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.335
Well, it's a classic.

11:51.419 --> 11:55.798
Maybe you are just not learned
in fine jewelry.

11:55.881 --> 11:58.384
Why are you defending it?
It's not like you picked it out.

12:01.011 --> 12:03.264
Oh, sweet Jesus,
you picked it out?

12:05.224 --> 12:08.144
Why would Rick ask you
to pick out my ring?

12:08.227 --> 12:10.521
Well, you know, look at me.

12:12.314 --> 12:15.818
- Yeah, look at ya.
- What's that supposed to mean?

12:15.901 --> 12:19.155
Oh, well, it just means
we kinda have different tastes.

12:19.238 --> 12:21.949
Yeah, mine's good,
yours sucks.

12:22.032 --> 12:23.826

That's so funny

the same thing, only opposite.

12:27.580 --> 12:29.039
Oh, really,
then, um, why'd you ask me

12:29.123 --> 12:30.708
to help you plan your wedding
in the first place?

12:30.791 --> 12:33.752
I didn't ask you.

12:33.836 --> 12:35.629
Then what were you planning
on doing in this thing?

12:35.713 --> 12:38.090
Uh, catching killer bees, maybe?

12:39.967 --> 12:42.052
I love this veil.

12:42.136 --> 12:44.096
This is the veil
I wanna wear at my wedding.

12:44.180 --> 12:46.724
I didn't ask you for your help.
I don't want your invitations.

12:46.807 --> 12:50.102
I don't want your color scheme
and nobody wants a hummus bar.

12:50.186 --> 12:52.563
Well, everyone loves
a hummus bar.

Maybe in Beirut.

Yeah, don't do that.

Hey, listen, he's like that
with all of his new acts

13:21.800 --> 13:23.552
but he's a good guy.

13:23.636 --> 13:25.596
And, hey, if he thinks you have
potential, maybe next time

13:25.679 --> 13:27.515
you won't have to pay to play.

- Pay to play?
- No, he's a crazy rock star.

13:30.309 --> 13:32.269
Probably on drugs. Let's go.

13:32.353 --> 13:34.813
No one paid for me to play here,
I sent my CD to Omar

13:34.897 --> 13:36.982
and he booked me
'cause he had an opening.

13:38.526 --> 13:40.736
Dude, everybody pays
to play here.

13:45.533 --> 13:47.284
Uh, can I have another photo
because I feel

13:47.368 --> 13:49.203
this will be the last time
that I ever see you.

13:49.286 --> 13:50.621

to get this gig, didn't you?

13:50.704 --> 13:52.581
Oh, Ben, look, I know

13:52.665 --> 13:54.166
that you wanted the universe
to book you

13:54.250 --> 13:56.794
but the universe
didn't have $500

13:56.877 --> 13:58.170
to give Omar and I did.

13:58.254 --> 13:59.463
You paid for me
to get this gig?

13:59.547 --> 14:00.881
Well, I was just
trying to help you.

14:00.965 --> 14:01.966
You don't think
I can do it on my own?

14:02.049 --> 14:03.342
Of course, I do,
but this is just

14:03.425 --> 14:04.760
how it works
in the music business.

14:04.843 --> 14:07.429
Stop telling me how it works
in the music business.

14:07.513 --> 14:09.098
You don't know
anything about it.

14:09.181 --> 14:10.683
Well, I do know
that if it weren't for me

14:10.766 --> 14:12.768
you wouldn't be singing here.

14:14.228 --> 14:16.480
Well, guess what? I'm not.

I can get into R now.

I gotta tell ya,
I think you refusing to play

14:39.712 --> 14:41.130
is such the way to go.

14:41.213 --> 14:42.298
Well, I don't.

14:42.381 --> 14:43.674
You know, if you don't play

14:43.757 --> 14:46.135
Holly's gonna lose 500 bucks.

14:46.218 --> 14:48.637
So what?
She shouldn't have pushed him

14:48.721 --> 14:50.723
when he specifically
asked her not to.

14:50.806 --> 14:52.808
But, dude,
that's the beauty of Holly.

14:52.891 --> 14:54.226
And when she's too pushy,
it's because

14:54.310 --> 14:56.061
she wants something good
to happen.

14:56.145 --> 14:57.896
Why do you think
she's pushing you?

14:57.980 --> 15:00.566
She wants you
to have success, man.

15:00.649 --> 15:01.984
And who's the one
who pushed you

15:02.067 --> 15:04.653
into finally feeling something
for somebody else?

15:04.737 --> 15:07.823
And, hell, she pushed me
into buying these pants

15:07.906 --> 15:09.867
which got me a date
with the salesgirl.

15:09.950 --> 15:12.953
And last night,
I got my inseam measured.

15:14.622 --> 15:15.748

You know what, man,
Gary's right.

15:22.504 --> 15:25.883

she cares enough to push you.

where I got my pants?

15:35.934 --> 15:38.062
I'm gonna tell you something
you're not gonna like.

15:38.145 --> 15:40.147
I spent the money
you gave me for books

15:40.230 --> 15:42.691

15:42.775 --> 15:45.319
- No, you didn't.
- Yeah, I did.

- No, you didn't.
- Yeah, I did.

15:51.241 --> 15:54.161
Oh, Holly,
I gave you a blank check.

15:54.244 --> 15:57.206
- How much, Holly? How much?
- This isn't about numbers, Val.

15:57.289 --> 15:59.083
The point is

15:59.166 --> 16:02.836
I was wrong and I'm sorry.
I'll never do it again.

16:02.920 --> 16:05.297
- Five hundred dollars.
- Five hundred dollars?

16:05.381 --> 16:08.092
Yeah, and, uh, I need
another check for books.

16:09.635 --> 16:11.261
Ha ha.

a horrible thing.

from the owner

with Val Tyler.

I own my own business.

I don't take no for an answer.

- No.

If there is
no entertainment on stage

16:56.014 --> 16:58.434
you are not getting one penny
of your money back.

16:58.517 --> 17:00.728
How the hell am I supposed
to get entertainment here

Oh, no, no!
Unh-unh, no.

to get me to come down here

- Yes.

18:07.920 --> 18:10.881
- Holly, I've been an idiot.
- No, I was the idiot.

You told me to back off
and I didn't.

- No, I was freaking out.

I mean, I came here
without a job.

18:16.261 --> 18:18.931

that's why I was pushing you.

I was afraid that if you didn't
get a job, then you'd leave.

18:21.600 --> 18:24.770
- Or worse, then you'd stay.
- Why would that be worse?

18:24.853 --> 18:26.855
Because if you stayed
and didn't get a job

18:26.939 --> 18:28.774
then you'd only be here for me.
