* *

00:13.067 --> 00:14.533
- * Looking up at the sky *

00:14.600 --> 00:16.100
- What's the name
of the town again?

00:16.167 --> 00:18.100
- Tinahely.
- [Irish accent] Tinahely.

00:18.167 --> 00:20.367
[laughs]
That's outside Dublin, right?

00:20.433 --> 00:22.600
- Yeah, way outside.
Where the post office

00:22.667 --> 00:24.800
is also the grocery store.

00:24.867 --> 00:27.667
Once I stepped in horse poop
just so I'd have something to do

00:27.733 --> 00:29.900
when I got home.
- [laughs]

00:29.967 --> 00:33.700
It looks green.
- Yeah, it's very green.

00:33.767 --> 00:35.733
And very different from here.
- Yeah, well,

00:35.800 --> 00:37.267
there's hardly
any horse poop here.

00:37.333 --> 00:39.367
- You don't need it.

00:39.433 --> 00:42.267
There's street fairs
and roof parties

00:42.333 --> 00:44.067
and so many
great restaurants.

00:44.133 --> 00:47.533
Japanese, Italian,
Korean, Indian--

00:47.600 --> 00:50.100
just on this block.
I mean, who needs to travel?

00:50.167 --> 00:52.467
- Well, what's your favorite?
- Hm, Mexican.

00:52.533 --> 00:55.067
- Mexican?
- We don't have any

00:55.133 --> 00:58.100
Mexican food in Tinahely.

00:58.167 --> 01:00.200
Another?
- Well, that depends.

01:00.267 --> 01:01.867
What time's
your shift up tonight?

01:01.933 --> 01:03.433
- I'm closing tonight.
- [groans] Then yes,

01:03.500 --> 01:05.300
I will have another.

01:05.367 --> 01:07.500
You know I'm just gonna
sit here every single night

01:07.567 --> 01:09.667
until you're free, right?
- You're sweet.

01:09.733 --> 01:11.933
- Oh.
- And drinking way too much.

01:12.067 --> 01:14.200
- Hey! If that's what it takes
to hang out with you,

01:14.267 --> 01:16.167
then that's the price
that I'm gonna pay.

01:16.233 --> 01:18.167
- Well, I'm working
the early shift tomorrow.

01:18.233 --> 01:20.100
Maybe we could actually
hang out somewhere

01:20.167 --> 01:23.400
that doesn't compromise
your liver or my tips.

01:23.467 --> 01:24.867
- Perfect.

01:24.933 --> 01:26.433
But just to be clear, here.

01:26.500 --> 01:28.467
We're not gonna be
just hanging out.

01:28.533 --> 01:31.433
I am gonna take you
on a proper date.

01:31.500 --> 01:33.800
- Then I look forward to it.

01:33.867 --> 01:35.933
- Hey, can we get
some beers over here?

01:36.067 --> 01:38.133
- You want me to kick his ass?

01:38.200 --> 01:40.800
- You should probably go.

01:40.867 --> 01:43.800
[upbeat music]

01:43.867 --> 01:50.500
* *

01:50.567 --> 01:52.433
- For those of you
who aren't aware,

01:52.500 --> 01:57.067
sales of adult coloring books
grew 12-fold last year.

01:57.067 --> 02:00.267
- I thought it was just a fad,
but it just keeps going.

02:00.333 --> 02:02.167
And half the buyers
are millennial women.

02:02.233 --> 02:04.867
- Yes, your generation continues
to elevate the culture.

02:04.933 --> 02:08.200
Coloring, doodling,
cannabis cookbooks.

02:08.267 --> 02:10.467
- Ooh, maybe we could
combine trends

02:10.533 --> 02:12.233
and release a coloring book
of pot plants.

02:12.300 --> 02:14.733
It comes with, like,
edible crayons.

02:14.800 --> 02:17.867
The campaign could be,
"This Coloring Bok is so Dope."

02:17.933 --> 02:20.933
[giggling]

02:21.067 --> 02:22.067
I'm done.

02:26.100 --> 02:27.567
[elevator dings]

02:27.633 --> 02:29.700
- Charles?
- Yeah?

02:29.767 --> 02:31.700
- I don't mean to step on
Pauline's toes,

02:31.767 --> 02:36.167
but I just want to be clear
on my responsibilities...

02:36.233 --> 02:39.067
for the company picnic
at your house on Saturday.

02:39.067 --> 02:40.900
- That's this Saturday?

02:40.967 --> 02:43.333
Um, can you take charge
of the preparations

02:43.400 --> 02:45.333
like you did last year?
- Of course.

02:45.400 --> 02:47.133
We'll need rentals
and catering.

02:47.200 --> 02:49.933
Do you mind if I get
a little wild this year

02:50.067 --> 02:53.167
and serve Asian slaw?
- Whatever you want.

02:53.233 --> 02:55.067
And thank you, Diana.
- Oh, my pleasure.

02:55.100 --> 02:58.800
And I assume Pauline
will be on the list?

02:58.867 --> 03:00.667
- Um...

03:00.733 --> 03:02.933
- Aren't all of our
other authors invited?

03:03.067 --> 03:04.533
- Uh, yeah.

03:04.600 --> 03:06.600
So I suppose
we should invite Pauline.

03:06.667 --> 03:10.533
- And should I call her at...
the house or...

03:10.600 --> 03:12.867
- She's at her sister's.
Send an email.

03:15.067 --> 03:16.300
- That's gonna be awkward,

03:16.367 --> 03:18.800
hosting a woman
at her former home.

03:18.867 --> 03:20.633
Luckily, you'll be there
to look after her.

03:20.700 --> 03:25.800
* *

03:25.867 --> 03:29.900
- How you feeling about
Pauline coming back to New York?

03:29.967 --> 03:31.867
- It's interesting.

03:31.933 --> 03:34.133
- Julia said she's like
a different woman.

03:34.200 --> 03:36.267
Jazzed about that book
she's written.

03:36.333 --> 03:38.767
Says she seems really happy.
- It's good to hear.

03:38.833 --> 03:40.600
- You guys gonna try
to work it out?

03:40.667 --> 03:42.667
- I don't think so.

03:42.733 --> 03:44.800
- Eh, look, I know
what she did was crazy,

03:44.867 --> 03:46.633
leaving you and the kids
to go find her bliss

03:46.700 --> 03:48.800
or whatever,
but marriage is crazy.

03:48.867 --> 03:51.633
I wish Julia
would leave me for a year.

03:51.700 --> 03:53.667
I'd welcome the break.

03:53.733 --> 03:56.333
- It's not that simple.

03:56.400 --> 03:58.900
There's someone else.

03:58.967 --> 04:00.533
- What? Who?

04:00.600 --> 04:03.267
- I'll tell you when I'm ready.
I promise.

04:03.333 --> 04:07.133
Just...please don't mention
any of this to Julia right now.

04:07.200 --> 04:10.533
- Believe me, she's the
last person I'm gonna tell.

04:10.600 --> 04:15.400
* *

04:15.467 --> 04:17.567
- [sighs] I think Charles
is seeing someone else.

04:19.067 --> 04:20.733
- What?
Why would you say that?

04:20.800 --> 04:23.800
- Well, a friend said something
and then I went online

04:23.867 --> 04:26.067
and I saw these pictures of him
at some benefit

04:26.067 --> 04:27.800
with this gorgeous woman
named Radha?

04:27.867 --> 04:31.067
- Oh, that's over.
- It is?

04:31.133 --> 04:33.667
- Well, so--
so who is it, then?

04:33.733 --> 04:35.533
- Pauline...

04:35.600 --> 04:37.800
you know, I've got to
stop you right there.

04:37.867 --> 04:40.667
Am I here to gossip
and speculate

04:40.733 --> 04:43.133
about your husband
or am I here to edit a book

04:43.200 --> 04:46.700
which could have
universal appeal and resonance

04:46.767 --> 04:48.967
for many, many women?

04:49.067 --> 04:52.067
'Cause if it's the second one,
I'm all in.

04:52.100 --> 04:54.933
- It's the second one,
of course.

04:55.067 --> 04:56.533
It's just I heard he might
be seeing someone.

04:56.600 --> 04:58.133
It's hard to shake it.

04:58.200 --> 04:59.633
Sorry.
[chuckles]

04:59.700 --> 05:01.067
Let's get to work.

05:01.133 --> 05:08.167
* *

05:17.133 --> 05:18.667
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:18.733 --> 05:20.267
Where you going?
Hot date?

05:20.333 --> 05:22.933
- Yeah, actually.
I'm taking Clare out.

05:23.067 --> 05:24.667
- Nice.
No.

05:24.733 --> 05:26.600
- No?

05:26.667 --> 05:29.067
- Hey, do you own
your tattoo designs

05:29.100 --> 05:31.200
or does the person
with the tattoo own it?

05:31.267 --> 05:34.267
- I own 'em.
I have the exclusive copyright

05:34.333 --> 05:36.067
on a lot of flesh
in this town.

05:36.067 --> 05:38.433
- You know, you could design
an adult coloring book.

05:38.500 --> 05:40.333
- What do you mean?
Like draw a bunch of

05:40.400 --> 05:42.600
naked people doing stuff?
- No!

05:42.667 --> 05:45.067
Your tattoos in a book
that people would color.

05:45.100 --> 05:46.433
- And who would do that?

05:46.500 --> 05:48.200
- 13 million people
last year.

05:48.267 --> 05:53.800
And I can guarantee you
at least a $10,000 advance.

05:53.867 --> 05:56.067
- Ten grand?
- Yeah.

05:56.100 --> 05:58.200
- There is not a whole lot
that I wouldn't do

05:58.267 --> 05:59.533
for ten grand.
- Great.

05:59.600 --> 06:01.933
I'm gonna run it by Liza.
- Great.

06:02.067 --> 06:05.667
- Still no.
- Bye.

06:05.733 --> 06:07.333
- Have fun.

06:07.400 --> 06:10.333
[Latin music]

06:10.400 --> 06:15.667
* *

06:15.733 --> 06:18.333
- So, uh, tell me
about this internship.

06:18.400 --> 06:19.933
You're a tester?
You just, like,

06:20.067 --> 06:22.067
get to play games all day
or what?

06:22.067 --> 06:25.600
- I'm an intern, so I do
whatever people ask me to do.

06:25.667 --> 06:28.467
Anything from coffee
to coding.

06:28.533 --> 06:31.067
- That's so cool.
- I love it.

06:31.133 --> 06:33.067
I honestly feel so lucky.

06:33.133 --> 06:36.833
I mean, even if nothing
comes of it, I'm here now,

06:36.900 --> 06:39.233
having the best time.

06:40.900 --> 06:42.500
- Jalapenos?
- Yes!

06:42.567 --> 06:45.167
- Mild, hot, loco.

06:46.333 --> 06:48.933
- [laughs]
- Thank you.

06:49.067 --> 06:50.667
- I'm actually
a jalapeno virgin.

06:50.733 --> 06:52.067
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

06:52.067 --> 06:53.267
- All right,
go easy on these.

06:53.333 --> 06:54.967
They're not messing around here.

06:55.067 --> 06:57.200
- Okay, I'm going in.
- That's the mild one.

06:59.167 --> 07:00.933
- Eh?

07:01.067 --> 07:02.267
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

07:02.333 --> 07:04.100
- Nothing.
- All right.

07:06.967 --> 07:10.500
- [exhales]
- Climbing up?

07:10.567 --> 07:12.167
- Not too bad.
- It's getting there, though.

07:12.233 --> 07:14.133
I see it.

07:14.200 --> 07:16.567
- Okay, I'm going in.
- Wait, wait.

07:16.633 --> 07:19.233
Be careful.
That is loco.

07:19.300 --> 07:21.067
You sure about this?
- I'm ready.

07:21.100 --> 07:22.700
- Be careful.

07:28.300 --> 07:29.700
[exhales]
- Oh, my God.

07:29.767 --> 07:31.167
- Are you okay?

07:31.233 --> 07:32.867
- Oh, my God.
That is the hottest thing

07:32.933 --> 07:34.700
I've ever eaten.
[exhales sharply]

07:34.767 --> 07:37.500
My mouth is on fire.
- Sorry.

07:37.567 --> 07:39.533
Wait! Hey!

07:39.600 --> 07:41.733
I think we just popped
your jalapeno.

- No.

07:55.733 --> 07:59.367
[whispers] I kinda like it.
- [laughs]

07:59.433 --> 08:01.233
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm.

08:01.300 --> 08:02.767
- Yeah?

- Are you okay?
- [exhales sharply] Ooh.

08:05.800 --> 08:10.633
Yeah, I am just dandy.

- Ohh...aah...

08:27.133 --> 08:29.333
Oh, it's like burning.
- What is?

08:29.400 --> 08:31.100
- Ohh, my dick.
Ohh!

08:31.167 --> 08:33.333
Ohh!
My dick is on fire!

08:33.400 --> 08:34.733
Aah!
- Why?

08:34.800 --> 08:36.533
- The peppers!
The jalapenos!

08:36.600 --> 08:38.100
[gasps]
Oh, my God, the pepper!

08:38.167 --> 08:39.467
Your hands were
all over the peppers!

08:39.533 --> 08:41.300
[screams]
- What are you doing?

08:41.367 --> 08:43.300
- Ah, I'm swaddling.
- Uh...

08:43.367 --> 08:45.133
- Oh, my God,
it's getting worse.

08:45.200 --> 08:46.600
It's getting worse.
I'm gonna jump in the shower.

08:46.667 --> 08:48.067
- No! No! No!
- Why?

08:48.133 --> 08:49.567
- Water spreads the oils.
Don't do that.

08:49.633 --> 08:51.467
What are you looking up
right now?

08:51.533 --> 08:53.167
- Jalapeno dick?
- What?

08:53.233 --> 08:54.667
- There are a lot of entries,
so we should feel

08:54.733 --> 08:56.467
a little better
about that, right?

08:56.533 --> 08:57.733
- I think I'm gonna
have to go to the hospital.

08:57.800 --> 09:00.133
[panting]
- Yogurt.

09:00.200 --> 09:01.533
We need yogurt.
- What?

09:01.600 --> 09:04.067
Yogurt! Yo--Yes!
+Right there!

09:04.067 --> 09:06.500
- They all say "Kelsey."
- Just grab the yogurt.

09:06.567 --> 09:08.933
Come on!
- Okay.

09:09.067 --> 09:12.500
- What's it say to do?
- Uh, saturate it.

09:12.567 --> 09:15.933
Tots to tip.
- Jesus. Oh, jeez.

09:16.067 --> 09:17.733
[screams]
- That'll do it.

09:17.800 --> 09:19.867
- [sighs in relief]

09:19.933 --> 09:22.800
Oh, my God so much better.

09:22.867 --> 09:25.633
- I am so sorry.
- [laughs] It's okay.

09:25.700 --> 09:28.600
It's okay.
[both laugh]

09:28.667 --> 09:31.633
Ohh.
I bet this is the...

09:31.700 --> 09:33.533
best first date
you've ever had, huh?

09:33.600 --> 09:36.767
- Oh, by far.
[both laughing]

09:41.567 --> 09:44.500

- Angry?
- Well, defeated and blotchy.

09:50.133 --> 09:51.767
- Hey.
- Oh! Sorry.

09:51.833 --> 09:53.300
- Oh, no, we weren't--
- No, no, no.

09:53.367 --> 09:54.300
- Sorry.
- It's none of my business.

09:54.367 --> 09:55.633
Wait, wait.

09:55.700 --> 09:57.500
Did you eat
all my yogurt?

09:57.567 --> 10:02.000
- Uh... I can honestly say
I did not eat your yogurt.

10:02.067 --> 10:04.500
- I'm so sorry.
It was me.

10:04.567 --> 10:07.633
Weird Irish girl
with the dairy cravings.

10:07.700 --> 10:10.067
I'll replace it.
- Oh, that's okay.

10:10.133 --> 10:12.767
Um, I talked to Liza
and she is totally on board

10:12.833 --> 10:14.933
with everything.
- Wait, so I have a book deal?

10:15.000 --> 10:16.333
- Yeah.
- Wow!

10:16.400 --> 10:17.767
- Oh, my God,
that's amazing.

10:17.833 --> 10:19.500
The ten grand thing?
- Yeah.

10:19.567 --> 10:21.500
- I thought you were joking.
- Thanks, Kels.

10:21.567 --> 10:23.300
So what's the next step?
- Why don't you come

10:23.367 --> 10:25.067
to the company picnic?
You can meet everyone

10:25.133 --> 10:27.500
and shake Charles' hand,
button up the deal.

10:27.567 --> 10:30.333
You've met Charles, right?
- Uh, a couple times.

10:30.400 --> 10:33.633
Yeah.
- A picnic sounds fun.

10:33.700 --> 10:36.133
- I don't know.
- No, it's really not that bad.

10:36.200 --> 10:38.000
There's food and drinks
and when people

10:38.067 --> 10:40.500
get nice and toasty,
there's a potato sack race.

10:40.567 --> 10:42.500
both: Ahh.
- Drunk people in potato sacks.

10:42.567 --> 10:44.200
Well, we have to go.
- [laughs]

10:44.267 --> 10:46.167
- I'll text you the address.
Come!

10:46.233 --> 10:48.100
- Maybe.

10:48.167 --> 10:50.467
[sighs]
- You don't want to go.

10:50.533 --> 10:52.133
- Nope.
- Not a picnic guy?

10:52.200 --> 10:53.900
- No, it's...

10:53.967 --> 10:56.433
not that, I...

10:56.500 --> 11:00.500
when I was dating Liza,
I caught her kissing Charles.

11:00.567 --> 11:03.433
Her boss, the one
that Kelsey wants me to...

11:03.500 --> 11:06.067
"shake hands with."

11:06.133 --> 11:08.233
- God, I'm so sorry.
That's horrible.

11:08.300 --> 11:10.533
- What's worse was...

11:10.600 --> 11:14.233
I was about to propose.

11:14.300 --> 11:17.233
[chuckles]
- Oh, you were gonna marry Liza?

11:17.300 --> 11:19.667
- Past tense.

11:19.733 --> 11:23.500
Past tense.
- Okay.

11:23.567 --> 11:26.533
Well, I think if you're ever
really gonna move on...

11:26.600 --> 11:29.333
- Mm-hmm?
- Go to the picnic,

11:29.400 --> 11:31.067
prove that
you're the bigger man,

11:31.133 --> 11:33.533
and get that $10,000
from his company.

11:33.600 --> 11:36.067
- Yeah.
- [whispers] Yeah.

11:36.133 --> 11:39.067
- You're kinda smart,
you know that?

11:39.067 --> 11:41.100
- I do.

11:44.100 --> 11:47.067
- Ow.
- Oh...[chuckles]

11:47.100 --> 11:48.900
- [inhales sharply, exhales]
- Yeah, not yet.

11:48.967 --> 11:50.267
- Just gonna wait here.

11:50.333 --> 11:53.267
[rock music]

11:53.333 --> 12:00.433
* *

12:03.100 --> 12:04.967
- So the watermelon-eating
contest will be followed

12:05.067 --> 12:07.267
by the tug-of-war
which you will referee.

12:07.333 --> 12:08.600
- Ooh, great.
When's the sack race?

12:08.667 --> 12:10.233
- Potato  sack race.

12:10.300 --> 12:11.767
Make sure you use
the "potato" preface.

12:11.833 --> 12:13.833
Someone complained to HR
that the word "sack"

12:13.900 --> 12:15.633
in isolation
is insensitive.

12:15.700 --> 12:18.200
People are so easily
triggered these days.

12:18.267 --> 12:19.800
[overlapping chatter]

12:19.867 --> 12:22.233
- Isn't that your ex?

12:22.300 --> 12:24.500
- Oh, yeah, Josh.
Um...

12:24.567 --> 12:26.433
he's doing the adult
coloring book for us.

12:26.500 --> 12:28.067
I-I-I didn't realize
he was coming.

12:28.133 --> 12:31.100
- Hm, obviously,
he's here to suck up to Charles.

12:31.167 --> 12:33.067
And throw that willowy
blond in your face.

12:33.100 --> 12:35.067
- Actually,
I introduced them.

12:35.133 --> 12:37.100
- You set him up
with a girl and a job?

12:37.167 --> 12:39.500
- Hm.
- Later we have to have a talk

12:39.567 --> 12:42.567
about how not to be
a doormat.

12:42.633 --> 12:44.833
[gentle music]

12:44.900 --> 12:47.133
- That's him.
That's Charles right there.

12:47.200 --> 12:48.833
- All right, best behavior.

12:48.900 --> 12:51.300
Remember, $10,000.

12:51.367 --> 12:54.300
- Ahh, you made it.
- Hey, we wouldn't miss it.

12:54.367 --> 12:55.633
- Charles, you remember Josh

12:55.700 --> 12:57.567
and this is
his girlfriend, Clare.

12:57.633 --> 12:59.567
- Nice to see ya.
- Thanks for having us.

12:59.633 --> 13:01.133
- Clare, nice to meet you.
- Hey.

13:01.200 --> 13:02.533
- Josh is so excited
about doing a book

13:02.600 --> 13:04.500
of his tattoos for us.
- Yeah.

13:04.567 --> 13:07.233
Yeah, I mean, honestly,
when I first heard about it,

13:07.300 --> 13:08.900
I thought it was a little lame.

13:08.967 --> 13:12.067
- Until Kelsey explained
what a gigantic market

13:12.100 --> 13:13.867
there is for
adult coloring books.

13:13.933 --> 13:15.433
- Right.
- She's not wrong

13:15.500 --> 13:18.333
and tattoos give it
a very millennial twist.

13:18.400 --> 13:20.800
- Totally.
- Millennials, yeah.+

13:20.867 --> 13:22.767
- Well, uh, nice to see you,
Josh.

13:22.833 --> 13:24.967
Nice to meet you, Clare.
Have fun today.

13:25.067 --> 13:27.533
- You, too.
- Thanks.

13:27.600 --> 13:29.900
- Nicely done.
- Thanks, babe.

13:31.933 --> 13:34.300
- [sighs]

13:47.433 --> 13:49.867
- Liza, hi!
- Pauline, hi.

13:49.933 --> 13:51.633
- Hi.

13:51.700 --> 13:54.333
Okay, be honest,
sexy or needy?

13:54.400 --> 13:56.233
- Oh, definitely sexy.
- Okay.

13:56.300 --> 13:59.833
kids: Mom!
- Hi! Hi, guys.

13:59.900 --> 14:02.167
You look so beautiful.
- Liza.

14:02.233 --> 14:05.433
- Hi.
- You know the girls?

14:05.500 --> 14:09.167
- She's our babysitter.
- She is?

14:09.233 --> 14:11.367
- You, uh--
You never mentioned that.

14:11.433 --> 14:12.967
- Oh, I just pinch hit.
- She's our favorite.

14:13.067 --> 14:15.500
- Oh.
- [laughs] I'm sure she is.

14:15.567 --> 14:18.167
- We should make wax hands.
- One for mommy, one for Liza?

14:18.233 --> 14:20.400
- Yeah.
- Okay, come on.

14:20.467 --> 14:24.067
- They're great kids.
- Oh, thanks.

14:24.133 --> 14:26.567
Bianca was just in diapers
when we broke ground here.

14:26.633 --> 14:28.733
- You built this place?
- Oh, yeah.

14:28.800 --> 14:31.933
Two years of my life, but
did it on time and on budget.

14:32.067 --> 14:33.933
- How'd you pull that off?

14:34.067 --> 14:36.400
- I gave the general contractor
a move-in date,

14:36.467 --> 14:39.233
said if I had a certificate
of occupancy in my hand by then,

14:39.300 --> 14:41.900
I'd buy him an ATV.
- Genius.

14:41.967 --> 14:43.933
- Yeah, well,
it's just basic bribery,

14:44.067 --> 14:45.500
but, you know, it works.
- [laughs]

14:45.567 --> 14:48.300
- Do you want a quick tour?
- Sure.

14:48.367 --> 14:49.867
- I'll give you
the ten cent tour.

14:49.933 --> 14:52.433
- Okay.

14:52.500 --> 14:55.633
- Lachlan.
- Hello.

14:55.700 --> 14:57.500
- Hi.
- Sweetheart, I want you to meet

14:57.567 --> 14:59.900
Kelsey Peters,
my new editor.

15:00.067 --> 15:03.067
This is my wife, Prina.
- Prenup?

15:03.067 --> 15:04.633
- [sputters]
- "Pree-NA"

15:04.700 --> 15:07.667
- Oh, sorry.

15:07.733 --> 15:08.800
- Darling, would you
like some wine?

15:08.867 --> 15:10.600
- Lillet.

15:10.667 --> 15:13.433
So, you're gonna be working
closely with my husband?

15:13.500 --> 15:15.300
- Yes.
Yeah, very closely.

15:15.367 --> 15:18.333
- Uh-huh.

15:18.400 --> 15:20.567
No.

15:20.633 --> 15:22.567
- [scoffs]

15:24.333 --> 15:27.067
- It's so weird
being back.

15:27.067 --> 15:30.233
Charles and I used to host
so many parties here.

15:30.300 --> 15:32.133
We used to call it
"Downton Grabby"

15:32.200 --> 15:33.667
because we walked in
on so many people--

15:33.733 --> 15:35.633
- Doing it?
- And doing it well.

15:35.700 --> 15:38.233
- [laughs]

15:38.300 --> 15:43.133
- Oh, this is
my favorite spot.

15:43.200 --> 15:46.833
Oh, I just used to love
spending time here with Charles

15:46.900 --> 15:51.367
reading, drinking coffee
just looking out at the grounds

15:51.433 --> 15:54.133
And now I'm a guest.
[chuckles]

15:54.200 --> 15:57.067
He's even taken down
all the pictures of me.

15:58.300 --> 16:01.967
There has to be
someone else, Liza.

16:02.067 --> 16:05.200
[chuckles]

16:05.267 --> 16:06.733
Who is that?

16:11.833 --> 16:13.900

- I mean, does she work

16:13.967 --> 16:15.667
at Empirical
is she someone--

16:15.733 --> 16:19.067
- I have no idea, Pauline.
- Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

16:19.100 --> 16:21.633
I'm sorry.
I'm not normally like this.

16:21.700 --> 16:23.767
I swear.
I just keep feeling like

16:23.833 --> 16:26.833
the other shoe's gonna drop,
you know?

16:26.900 --> 16:29.833
Suddenly I'm gonna find out
he's in love with some

16:29.900 --> 16:32.633
hot, young yoga instructor.

16:32.700 --> 16:35.867
I'm sure I sound crazy.
- You don't sound crazy.

16:35.933 --> 16:38.067
- Pauline, I'm so glad
you could come.

16:38.067 --> 16:40.067
- Oh, hi, Diana.
- [kisses]

16:40.133 --> 16:44.167
- I was hoping I could
speak to you for a moment?

16:44.233 --> 16:46.167
- Of course.
- And Liza has a race

16:46.233 --> 16:49.167
to officiate.
- Oh! [blows whistle]

16:49.233 --> 16:52.067
Sorry, that was really loud.
Wow. Okay.

16:52.100 --> 16:54.433
Talk soon?
- Yeah.

16:55.433 --> 16:58.733
- Shall we?
- Sure. Yes. Of course.

16:59.633 --> 17:01.800
- Okay, up to the hedge
and back.

17:01.867 --> 17:03.967
Hopping only.
No baby-step running.

17:04.067 --> 17:05.767
And if you drop the sack,
you're out.

17:05.833 --> 17:07.233
- Hey, hey, just so you know,

17:07.300 --> 17:08.933
I'm defending champion.
- Okay.

17:09.067 --> 17:10.967
Just so you know,
I grew up next to a feedlot.

17:11.067 --> 17:12.433
- Bring it on, country boy.

17:14.500 --> 17:16.467

that while I may have

17:16.533 --> 17:17.967
replaced you as hostess
for this event,

17:18.067 --> 17:19.767
that is the extent of it.

17:19.833 --> 17:22.367
Nothing is going on
between me and Charles.

17:22.433 --> 17:24.767
I mean, there's tension,
naturally,

17:24.833 --> 17:28.300
but nothing
has ever happened.

17:28.367 --> 17:30.233
Ever.

17:30.300 --> 17:31.467
- Thank you.

17:31.533 --> 17:33.833
That...means a lot.

17:33.900 --> 17:35.433
- Yeah.

17:35.500 --> 17:37.500
- On your mark!

17:37.567 --> 17:39.967

I just get competitive.

- So you punched him?
Are you crazy?

18:34.267 --> 18:36.867
- I guess I am.
- Okay, well, that punch

18:36.933 --> 18:41.167
just cost you $10,000.

20:11.767 --> 20:14.067
- I'm really sorry
about how all that went down.

20:14.133 --> 20:16.533
- Hey, I have three
brothers.

20:16.600 --> 20:18.067
They settle
all their disputes

20:18.133 --> 20:19.633
by punching guys
in the face.

20:19.700 --> 20:21.600
- I do feel
a lot better, though.

20:21.667 --> 20:23.700
- Everywhere?

20:23.767 --> 20:25.067
- Oh...

20:25.133 --> 20:27.833
"Everywhere?"
- [giggles]

20:29.333 --> 20:31.700
- Think you can be a little
late to the bar tonight?

20:31.767 --> 20:35.233
- I already took the night off.
- Ohh...

- Liza.
- No one touched the Asian slaw.

20:44.567 --> 20:46.533
So I'm gonna
take it home and dump it.

20:46.600 --> 20:48.300
- I'm freaking out.

20:48.367 --> 20:50.800
Why would Josh
have hit Charles?

20:54.767 --> 20:56.833
- Charles and I had
a moment in the Hamptons.

20:56.900 --> 20:58.300
- What?
- It was just a...

20:58.367 --> 21:00.267
spontaneous, irresponsible--

21:00.333 --> 21:02.433
- And Josh saw.

21:02.500 --> 21:05.433
And that's why
he didn't propose.

21:05.500 --> 21:07.333
Holy shit, Liza.

21:07.400 --> 21:09.700
- I know.
- Did you sleep with him?

21:09.767 --> 21:12.467
- No.
- Good.

21:12.533 --> 21:14.667
I'm gonna give you
some advice.

21:14.733 --> 21:17.100
Keep it that way.

21:17.167 --> 21:19.067
Sleeping with the boss
doesn't end well--

21:19.067 --> 21:21.567
for any of us.
