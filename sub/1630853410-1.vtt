02:46.901 --> 02:48.635
Me.

03:52.099 --> 03:53.934

12:42.763 --> 12:44.164
A babysitter?

12:44.197 --> 12:45.766
- Mm-hmm.
- You heard her.

12:46.533 --> 12:48.101
But... but I'm 15.

12:48.135 --> 12:50.637
Oh, well, you should have
thought about that

12:50.671 --> 12:52.673
before you got two tickets
in one day.

12:52.706 --> 12:54.374
I don't need a babysitter.

12:55.442 --> 12:57.311

12:57.344 --> 12:59.546
She makes us eat
pimento loaf sandwiches.

12:59.580 --> 13:01.883
Oh, boo-hoo.

13:01.916 --> 13:04.151

heard him coming,</i>

Show her you can be responsible.

15:22.857 --> 15:24.658
- She'll drop it.

23:44.225 --> 23:45.492
Aren't you in enough trouble?

23:46.493 --> 23:48.929
Well, I got to do something
to kill the time.

23:48.963 --> 23:50.497
<i>There is zero action here.</i>

23:50.531 --> 23:51.999
All right.

23:52.032 --> 23:53.766
But me and Kelly
have karate at three.

23:53.800 --> 23:55.069
Just get over here.

23:56.070 --> 23:57.271
Hm...

24:00.074 --> 24:02.309
<i>At least two days...</i>

24:02.343 --> 24:05.446
All righty, nails are clipped,
kitty box is clean.

24:05.479 --> 24:07.982
Who's ready for some banjo?

24:08.015 --> 24:09.483
Aunt Patty.

24:09.516 --> 24:11.118
<i>You heard it correctly.</i>

24:11.151 --> 24:12.785
<i>Like something
out of a comic book.</i>

24:12.820 --> 24:15.322
<i>There is a small,
unidentified craft</i>

24:15.356 --> 24:17.224
<i>hovering over the downtown area.</i>

24:17.258 --> 24:20.561
<i>Eyewitnesses say the UFO
just appeared out of nowhere.</i>

24:20.594 --> 24:22.463
<i>The government has yet
to make a statement,</i>

24:22.496 --> 24:25.199
<i>but we are getting
preliminary reports</i>

24:25.232 --> 24:27.468
<i>that this craft
could possibly be</i>

24:27.501 --> 24:30.137
<i>not of this world.</i>

24:30.170 --> 24:33.040
<i>I want to point out that so far,</i>

24:33.073 --> 24:35.809
<i>this craft is showing
no sign of hostility.</i>

24:35.843 --> 24:37.845
<i>There is no need to panic.</i>

24:37.878 --> 24:40.881
<i>I repeat,
there is no need to panic.</i>

24:40.914 --> 24:43.250
Shall I obliterate the city?

24:43.284 --> 24:47.087
Why would I destroy something
that will ultimately be mine?

24:47.855 --> 24:49.256
No.

24:49.290 --> 24:52.293
Activate the cloaking shield
and relocate.

24:55.062 --> 24:56.964
<i>And just like that,</i>

24:56.997 --> 24:59.099
<i>the small craft seems to have
just...</i>

24:59.133 --> 25:02.269
Should I be having
a complete meltdown over this?

25:03.237 --> 25:06.240
No, no, no.
It's probably just a...

25:06.273 --> 25:08.108
<i>some sort of
transport shuttle...</i>

25:08.142 --> 25:10.110
a weather balloon.

25:10.144 --> 25:12.313
It's always a weather balloon.
No big deal.

25:12.346 --> 25:13.847
<i>We're waiting for...</i>

25:15.149 --> 25:17.985
<i>This is a huge deal.</i>

25:18.018 --> 25:19.253
<i>Never seen anything...</i>

25:19.286 --> 25:21.355
<i>Are they hostile?</i>

25:21.388 --> 25:23.457
<i>People are
running through the streets!</i>

25:23.490 --> 25:25.426
See what I mean?

25:25.459 --> 25:26.560
Nothing.

25:26.593 --> 25:29.096
Hey, uh, I've got an idea.

25:29.129 --> 25:31.165
How about if I, um...

25:31.198 --> 25:34.868
go to the store
and buy us some...

25:34.902 --> 25:37.104
ice cream?
You like ice cream, right?

25:37.137 --> 25:38.906
I'm a kid, aren't I?

25:38.939 --> 25:40.140
Yes.

25:40.174 --> 25:42.343
Yes, you certainly are a kid.

25:42.376 --> 25:47.247
So I'm just gonna go
and get my poncho...

25:47.281 --> 25:49.550
- Mm-hmm.
- In the kitchen.

25:49.583 --> 25:51.985
I'm gonna go in there

25:52.019 --> 25:54.121
and go out the back door

25:54.154 --> 25:55.956
and head out to the store

25:55.989 --> 25:57.524
to get some ice cream.

25:57.558 --> 25:58.625
Yeah.

25:58.659 --> 26:00.260
And, Aunt Patty,

26:00.294 --> 26:03.030
please be very careful

26:03.063 --> 26:04.531
when you're getting
the ice cream.

26:06.633 --> 26:08.168
Give me a break.

26:09.503 --> 26:12.139
Uh, the kitchen's unlocked,
right?

26:12.172 --> 26:13.407
All set to go.

26:30.691 --> 26:32.393
<i>Action-vator activated.</i>

26:32.426 --> 26:33.527
<i>Main floor.</i>

26:46.006 --> 26:47.074

26:47.107 --> 26:49.143

26:52.246 --> 26:54.281
<i>Third Floor, quilting,</i>

26:54.314 --> 26:55.682
<i>Strategy Room,</i>

26:55.716 --> 26:58.352

26:58.385 --> 27:00.954
<i>Fourth Floor,
super suit generator.</i>

27:00.988 --> 27:03.190
<i>Time to find evil.</i>

27:08.262 --> 27:10.264
- Ready, Double A?
- Ready for action.

27:14.701 --> 27:17.704
<i>Super suit
generator powering up.</i>

27:17.738 --> 27:19.606
Powering up.

27:21.308 --> 27:23.610
<i>Transformation power charging.</i>

27:24.511 --> 27:26.246
<i>System ready.</i>

27:26.280 --> 27:28.248
Agent Action, activate.

27:28.282 --> 27:31.318
<i>Suit generator
sequence will now commence.</i>

27:31.351 --> 27:32.753
Super power activated.

27:39.359 --> 27:41.595
<i>Select destination.</i>

27:41.628 --> 27:43.597
Setting quadrants...

27:43.630 --> 27:45.332
for downtown.

27:45.365 --> 27:47.267
Let's do this.

27:47.301 --> 27:49.436
<i>Prepping for lift-off.</i>

27:55.676 --> 27:57.244
Hey, Mom.

27:57.277 --> 27:58.712
Hi, Brewster. It's Mom.

27:58.745 --> 28:02.049
Um, I'm just, uh, calling
to check in.

28:02.082 --> 28:03.350
You just left.

28:03.383 --> 28:05.152
Yes, I know, but,
sweetie, I just...

28:05.185 --> 28:07.287
I heard something
on the radio about

28:07.321 --> 28:09.490
<i>the possibility of UFOs, so...</i>

28:09.523 --> 28:12.226
<i>Three... Two... ♪</i> One...

28:17.164 --> 28:18.799
No...

28:18.833 --> 28:20.167
No UFOs here.

28:20.200 --> 28:22.135
Just crazy cat ladies.

28:22.169 --> 28:24.571
Aunt Patty is not
a crazy cat lady.

28:24.605 --> 28:26.406
<i>I mean, she's... she's not crazy.</i>

28:26.440 --> 28:28.242
<i>She's a cat lady,
but she's doing...</i>

28:28.275 --> 28:29.820
Okay, you know what?
Never mind. Just...

28:29.844 --> 28:32.179
call me if anything comes up.

28:36.583 --> 28:39.520
Hey. You sure that it's okay
we go to Miss Robinson's?

28:39.553 --> 28:41.321
Yeah, it's okay.

28:41.355 --> 28:43.457
Besides, it'll be good to play
for a new set of ears.

28:45.492 --> 28:49.363
Stop wasting time
with that stupid band.

28:55.269 --> 28:56.503
Uh...

28:56.537 --> 28:57.771
Eddie?

28:59.239 --> 29:00.374
What?

29:00.407 --> 29:03.076
About the new set of ears...

29:13.720 --> 29:17.724
Hey, sorry, the Banners
aren't home right now.

29:19.226 --> 29:23.330
I said, no more rock 'n' roll!

29:24.866 --> 29:26.466
Hey, what are you doing?

29:26.500 --> 29:28.235
Yeah, who do you think you are?

29:28.268 --> 29:29.570
I am...

29:29.603 --> 29:33.707
The Bubinator!

29:39.346 --> 29:41.181
Mr. Binkle?

29:43.183 --> 29:45.285
[chuckling.

29:46.386 --> 29:47.454
Look out!

29:52.292 --> 29:54.494
Did he say "The Bubinator"?

29:54.528 --> 29:55.596
Yeah.

29:57.497 --> 29:58.565
What are you doing?

29:59.566 --> 30:01.568
- Getting out of here.
- With a hammer?

30:02.536 --> 30:04.705
- You got a better plan?
- Got'cha.

30:04.738 --> 30:05.807
On three.

30:05.840 --> 30:08.442
One, two, three.

30:08.876 --> 30:12.914
I love. My monster makeover.

30:16.350 --> 30:18.452
Oh?

30:21.722 --> 30:25.225
The Bubinator is triggered.

30:37.437 --> 30:39.239
Oh, look at that!

30:43.276 --> 30:49.216
You can't stop The Bubinator!

30:50.952 --> 30:53.754
<i>Unidentified
projectile entering quadrant.</i>

30:53.787 --> 30:56.690
Commander Kruel,
we're picking up a projectile

30:56.723 --> 30:58.392
that's heading right for us.

30:59.326 --> 31:01.328
It's Agent Action.

31:01.361 --> 31:03.697
Warp, relocate
then cloak the ship.

31:03.730 --> 31:06.700
I'll deal with that clanking
cretin soon enough.

31:06.733 --> 31:08.836
- Yes, your horribleness.
- Right away.

31:13.707 --> 31:15.143
<i>Target lost.</i>

31:19.013 --> 31:20.480
What the heck?

31:22.683 --> 31:25.887
All right, come on.
Where are you at?

31:25.920 --> 31:27.922
<i>I'm having trouble
tracking you, Double A.</i>

31:27.955 --> 31:29.423
<i>What's your location?</i>

31:30.791 --> 31:33.260
I'm on target.
No sign of Kruel's shuttle.

31:33.861 --> 31:35.595
The tracking signal
just vanished.

31:35.629 --> 31:38.532
Uh, he may have
changed positions.

31:38.565 --> 31:40.868
Uh, I'm gonna rescan
the entire city.

31:40.902 --> 31:42.837
No problemo, big guy.

31:42.870 --> 31:44.906
<i>Scanning for enemy craft.</i>

31:44.939 --> 31:47.340
<i>Multiple signals located.</i>

31:47.374 --> 31:48.910
Okay, we're getting
multiple signals

31:48.943 --> 31:51.411
in different locations now. I...

31:51.445 --> 31:53.014
I don't like this, no,

31:53.047 --> 31:54.916
<i>you should get back
so we can regroup</i>

31:54.949 --> 31:57.384
<i>because either Kruel
is scrambling our signals, or,</i>

31:57.417 --> 31:59.020
I hate to say this,

31:59.053 --> 32:00.888
There's more
than one villain in town.

32:02.689 --> 32:03.790
Look out!

32:06.393 --> 32:10.430
I'll teach you
to respect your elders!

32:21.508 --> 32:22.844
Paintball!

32:22.877 --> 32:24.511
There's no stopping...

32:24.544 --> 32:25.913
This will teach you.

32:25.947 --> 32:28.749
The Bubinator!

32:30.017 --> 32:32.519
Hey, Bubinator!

32:32.552 --> 32:34.021
Huh?

32:34.055 --> 32:35.555
Reach for the sky.

32:35.589 --> 32:37.791
Or get ready
to taste the rainbow.

32:37.825 --> 32:39.626
Say hello to my little friend.

32:51.638 --> 32:54.842
Revenge will be mine!

33:16.763 --> 33:17.865
Hi, Brewster.

33:19.566 --> 33:20.968
Tracy! Uh...

33:21.836 --> 33:23.037
Hi.

33:24.571 --> 33:26.673
What are you doing at
Miss Robinson's house?

33:26.706 --> 33:30.978
Uh... I was helping her
with the lawn.

33:31.012 --> 33:32.579
That's nice of you.

33:32.612 --> 33:34.124
She's always helping
everyone else out.

33:34.148 --> 33:35.649
It's good to pay it forward.

33:35.682 --> 33:38.585
Uh, yeah, I mean, that's...

33:38.618 --> 33:40.754
I pay it forward all the time.
That's just my way.

33:40.787 --> 33:43.057
For all she's done for you,
I can see why.

33:43.090 --> 33:44.324
Done for me?

33:44.859 --> 33:46.894
Didn't she tell you?

33:46.928 --> 33:48.538
She's on the neighborhood
watch with my dad.

33:48.562 --> 33:49.739
She's talked him out
of calling the police

33:49.763 --> 33:51.731
on your band a bunch of times.

33:52.566 --> 33:53.733
She did that?

33:54.168 --> 33:55.870
Yeah.

33:55.903 --> 33:57.771
Too bad
she wasn't there yesterday.

33:58.705 --> 34:00.674
Speaking of, sorry.

34:01.876 --> 34:04.111
My dad can get kind of uptight.

34:04.145 --> 34:06.147
Uptight?

34:06.180 --> 34:07.915
I hadn't noticed.

34:07.949 --> 34:09.482
I mean, what else are dads for

34:09.516 --> 34:11.018
if they're not laying down
the law for

34:11.052 --> 34:12.786
virtually everyone
in the neighborhood?

34:12.820 --> 34:15.488
Yeah, try being raised by him.

34:17.791 --> 34:19.426
I wonder where he is.

34:19.459 --> 34:20.838
He was supposed to pick me up
from the mall,

34:20.862 --> 34:22.163
but he never showed up.

34:22.196 --> 34:23.956
I'm sure he's hovering
around here somewhere.

34:30.872 --> 34:33.107
Dirty yard!

34:37.544 --> 34:40.982
Well, Commander Kruel,
we have excellent news.

34:41.015 --> 34:42.782
You found the Encapsulator.

34:42.817 --> 34:44.684
Our radar is going bananas.

34:45.987 --> 34:47.420
We're picking up signals

34:47.454 --> 34:50.590
only the resonator's
powers can emit.

34:50.624 --> 34:53.895
Someone has your technology.

34:53.928 --> 34:55.462
Where?

34:55.495 --> 34:57.464
Looking in on signal one.

35:02.636 --> 35:04.704
What is that?

35:04.738 --> 35:06.140
I don't know.

35:06.173 --> 35:07.942
But he seems to have
his panties in a wad.

35:11.979 --> 35:13.114
Enough.

35:13.147 --> 35:14.614
Show me the second signal.

35:14.648 --> 35:16.183
Right away, sir.

35:16.217 --> 35:18.853
There's a strong signal
coming from this garage.

35:24.591 --> 35:27.627
Uh, not the garage,
turn over to the humans.

35:28.495 --> 35:31.198
Maybe they activated the device.

35:31.232 --> 35:32.867
There's nothing there, either.

35:32.900 --> 35:34.936
Fools!

35:34.969 --> 35:37.838
The stronger signal
is coming from a place

35:37.872 --> 35:41.641
the humans call Lakeview Avenue.

35:41.675 --> 35:43.777
Agent Action...

35:43.811 --> 35:45.122
There's a tremendous
amount of energy

35:45.146 --> 35:46.646
emanating from the structure.

35:46.680 --> 35:48.883
He must have the Encapsulator.

35:48.916 --> 35:50.717
You found his headquarters.

35:50.750 --> 35:53.620
Well done,
my bucket head minions.

35:53.653 --> 35:54.989
Well, I do what I can.

35:55.022 --> 35:56.824
It was really nothing.

35:56.857 --> 36:00.027
Ah! Head to those coordinates
and prepare for battle!

36:00.061 --> 36:02.029
Right away, Commander Kruel.

36:02.063 --> 36:03.697
Aye, aye.

36:08.302 --> 36:09.703
Kimmy?

36:10.704 --> 36:11.771
Aunt Patty?

36:13.107 --> 36:14.976
Big Earl?

36:15.009 --> 36:17.577
Mr. Fuzzy Pants?

36:17.610 --> 36:18.678
Hey.

36:18.712 --> 36:20.114
Where's Aunt Patty?

36:20.147 --> 36:22.682
She's out saving the planet.

36:22.716 --> 36:24.852
Seriously?
Come on, where is she?

36:24.885 --> 36:27.188
I told you, she's a superhero.

36:27.221 --> 36:28.956
A superhero?

36:28.990 --> 36:30.224
Really?

36:30.257 --> 36:31.725
Okay, what's her superhero name?

36:31.758 --> 36:33.793
No, wait, let me guess. Is it...

36:33.828 --> 36:35.229
Bad Sandwich Lady?

36:35.262 --> 36:38.765
Or maybe it's The Claw Clipper.

36:38.798 --> 36:40.533
No. How about...

36:40.567 --> 36:42.003
Agent Action.

36:42.036 --> 36:43.304
<i>Action-vator activated.</i>

36:45.006 --> 36:46.740
Okay. You got me. What is this?

36:46.773 --> 36:49.076
Is this where she meditates
with Mr. Fuzzy Pants?

36:49.110 --> 36:52.579
No, it's the elevator
to her secret lair.

36:52.612 --> 36:53.881
Oh.

36:54.949 --> 36:56.683
<i>Going down.</i>

37:01.088 --> 37:02.789

37:22.609 --> 37:24.711
Uh, Brewster.

37:24.744 --> 37:26.613
What is this place?

37:27.982 --> 37:29.749
Oh, this.

37:31.118 --> 37:34.121
Uh, this is
Aunt Patty's home gym.

37:34.155 --> 37:37.291
You know what
a workout freak she is.

37:37.324 --> 37:39.126
- Very healthy.
- She is?

37:42.096 --> 37:44.865
I don't see
any workout equipment.

37:46.400 --> 37:48.035
Uh, because...

37:48.069 --> 37:49.702
Very good question.

37:49.736 --> 37:51.972
And it's a simple answer.

37:52.006 --> 37:55.843
Because it is being
delivered on Monday.

37:55.876 --> 37:57.686
Yes. We're just gonna
wait for the paint to dry...

37:57.710 --> 38:00.014
I need to run
a diagnostic on my helmet.

38:06.686 --> 38:08.055
Brewster?

38:10.057 --> 38:11.724
Aunt Patty.

38:12.759 --> 38:14.295
Who wants some ice cream?

38:20.968 --> 38:22.303
Where's your brother?

38:22.336 --> 38:25.005
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

38:25.039 --> 38:26.907
Uh, you'd be very surprised.

38:26.941 --> 38:28.909
Kimmy, something crazy
is going on.

38:28.943 --> 38:30.244
Where's Brewster?

38:30.277 --> 38:31.846
Down in the secret lair.

38:33.680 --> 38:36.383
<i>For over a hundred
years, the Robinson family,</i>

38:36.417 --> 38:38.986
<i>also known to
the world's secret agencies</i>

38:39.019 --> 38:42.423
<i>as the Action Pack,
has been in serious action.</i>

38:42.456 --> 38:45.159
<i>Since the first time
that great, great, great,</i>

38:45.192 --> 38:47.294
<i>great-grandpa Robinson donned</i>

38:47.328 --> 38:49.206
<i>- the very first super suit...</i>
- Aw, look at him.

38:49.230 --> 38:51.232
<i>And started
defending the world from evil,</i>

38:51.265 --> 38:55.035
<i>the Robinson family has
continued the heroic tradition</i>

38:55.069 --> 38:57.438
<i>of keeping us safe
throughout time.</i>

38:57.471 --> 39:01.308
<i>As each decade passes
and a family member retires,</i>

39:01.342 --> 39:03.878
<i>a new member
of the Robinson clan</i>

39:03.911 --> 39:07.381
<i>is chosen to carry on the
tradition of fighting evil.</i>

39:07.414 --> 39:10.351
<i>A person that's brave, pure,</i>

39:10.384 --> 39:12.419

<i>inspired by top secret
alien technology</i>

39:27.868 --> 39:33.474
<i>unearthed years ago

39:33.507 --> 39:38.778
<i>Agent Action,

39:38.812 --> 39:42.983
<i>Helping the world stay safe

- One bad guy at a time.

39:49.490 --> 39:51.025
Huh?

39:56.964 --> 39:59.166
You...

39:59.200 --> 40:01.202
You're Agent Action?

40:01.235 --> 40:02.369
Yes, I am.

40:03.470 --> 40:05.430
And now that you know,
I'm gonna have to kill you.

40:07.942 --> 40:09.443
Just kidding.

40:11.245 --> 40:12.745
I'm just pulling your leg.

40:12.779 --> 40:13.981
But, yeah, it's true.

40:14.014 --> 40:16.283
I'm him or... her.

40:16.317 --> 40:17.384
Agent Action.

40:18.219 --> 40:19.752
What about this cool suit?

40:19.786 --> 40:21.388
It's unbelievably coo...

40:21.422 --> 40:23.257
Wait, you're Agent Action!

40:23.290 --> 40:24.358
What are you doing?

40:25.292 --> 40:27.061
Turning on the secret elevator.

40:27.094 --> 40:28.963
Elevator?

40:28.996 --> 40:30.831
To the underground lair.

40:30.864 --> 40:32.266
Are you paying attention?

40:32.299 --> 40:34.767
Kimmy, where's Brewster?

40:34.801 --> 40:37.071
It's not working now.

40:39.506 --> 40:41.774
Hey, Shnookie!

40:52.186 --> 40:53.854
Where are we?

40:53.887 --> 40:57.391
Uh-oh, we've got visitors!

40:57.424 --> 40:59.960
- Who might they be?
- Pathetic Earthlings.

41:01.362 --> 41:03.197
Where is he?

41:06.900 --> 41:08.102
Hey!

41:08.135 --> 41:10.404
What an adorable little sapling.

41:10.437 --> 41:12.072
Tell me, my sweet child,

41:12.106 --> 41:15.909
where is the Earthling known
as Agent Action?

41:15.943 --> 41:18.312
- I don't know.
- Are you sure?

41:18.345 --> 41:21.081
The only thing I'm sure of...

41:21.115 --> 41:22.416
Yes?

41:22.449 --> 41:26.053
Is that your breath
really, really,

41:26.086 --> 41:29.390
really, really stinks.

41:30.024 --> 41:34.061
Like, you really need a mint.

41:37.231 --> 41:38.532
Seize them!

42:02.156 --> 42:04.458
I'll locate Agent Action!

42:04.491 --> 42:06.894
He needs a little snack!

42:07.961 --> 42:10.431
Commander, there's nobody here!

42:10.464 --> 42:11.532
Hey, ugly.

42:14.268 --> 42:15.636
Ugh.

42:15.669 --> 42:17.447
- Weren't you watching them?
- I turned around

42:17.471 --> 42:18.906
- and the elevator opened.
- Okay.

42:20.474 --> 42:22.276
You're a superhero, right?

42:24.044 --> 42:25.212
You're kind of short.

42:25.245 --> 42:26.647
No, no, no, no.

42:26.680 --> 42:28.515
It's not about the size
of your biceps.

42:30.084 --> 42:32.252
It's what's in your heart
that makes a superhero.

42:32.686 --> 42:35.956
You seriously didn't
just say that, did you?

42:35.989 --> 42:37.291
I could barely get it out.

42:38.058 --> 42:39.393
No, but I get what you mean.

42:41.228 --> 42:42.596
That suit.

42:42.629 --> 42:44.231
It's pretty dope.

42:44.264 --> 42:45.966
Thanks, uh...

42:45.999 --> 42:48.569
I guess it is very... dope.

42:48.602 --> 42:50.137
But really,

42:50.170 --> 42:52.973
you know, you can't tell
anyone about this.

42:53.607 --> 42:55.542
Well, even if I did,
who would believe me?

42:55.576 --> 42:57.511
No, no, Brewster, listen to her.

42:57.544 --> 42:59.413
There are nefarious
alien forces on Earth

42:59.446 --> 43:01.181
that are up
to no good right now.

43:01.215 --> 43:02.983
Nothing can slow the progress

43:03.016 --> 43:04.451
of Agent Action
from stopping them.

43:07.154 --> 43:08.222
Okay.

43:13.727 --> 43:15.963
<i>And, action!</i>

43:15.996 --> 43:17.231

Okay, okay, look,
what does he mean?

44:27.734 --> 44:30.037
Bring him the Encapsulator?

I don't know. Unless...

44:40.380 --> 44:42.349

his own Encapsulators.

Okay, who's ringing?

1:02:08.195 --> 1:02:09.831
Oh, it's Brewster's.

1:02:09.864 --> 1:02:11.398
Oh, it's his mom.

1:02:11.431 --> 1:02:13.433
No, no, I'm not
gonna talk to her.

1:02:13.467 --> 1:02:14.845
No, no, no.
I'm gonna say something stupid.

1:02:14.869 --> 1:02:16.270
No, no, no. You have to.

1:02:16.303 --> 1:02:17.623
I'll screw up the whole...
No, no.

1:02:19.773 --> 1:02:22.109
Uh, hello?

1:02:22.142 --> 1:02:23.677
- Who's this?
- Oh.

1:02:23.710 --> 1:02:26.213
Hi, Mrs. Banner. It's Kelly.

1:02:26.246 --> 1:02:29.249
Oh, hi, Kelly. Where's Brewster?

1:02:29.716 --> 1:02:33.587
You just missed him.
He... took off.

1:02:33.620 --> 1:02:35.460
<i>Oh, good. Well, you
know, I've been telling him</i>

1:02:35.489 --> 1:02:36.623
<i>he should get some more air.</i>

1:02:36.657 --> 1:02:38.625
Oh, he's getting a lot of air.

1:02:39.326 --> 1:02:40.627
A lot.

1:02:40.661 --> 1:02:42.296
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

1:02:42.329 --> 1:02:45.232
Um, well, listen,
I have some good news for him.

1:02:46.533 --> 1:02:48.201
He doesn't have to
spend the night.

1:02:48.235 --> 1:02:49.536
I'm coming home early.

1:02:49.570 --> 1:02:51.371
- You're coming home early?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1:02:51.405 --> 1:02:53.808
Apparently my boss has
an allergy to shellfish.

1:02:53.841 --> 1:02:56.844
<i>Threw up in his boss's lap,
so, convention over.</i>

1:02:56.878 --> 1:02:59.413
Oh, I'm sure he's gonna be
very surprised.

1:02:59.446 --> 1:03:02.282
What time can I tell him
to expect you?

1:03:02.316 --> 1:03:04.117
Oh, I should be back
before dark.

1:03:04.151 --> 1:03:05.419
Before dark.

1:03:06.186 --> 1:03:08.455
Okay, well,
I'll be sure to let him know

1:03:08.488 --> 1:03:10.123
when I see him again.

1:03:11.258 --> 1:03:12.359
If you see him.

1:03:12.392 --> 1:03:14.261
<i>Thanks, darling. You know,</i>

1:03:14.294 --> 1:03:15.873
I know that Brewster wasn't
very excited about this whole

1:03:15.897 --> 1:03:17.531
babysitter idea,

1:03:17.564 --> 1:03:19.275

to learn to step up,

1:03:19.299 --> 1:03:21.602

Ow!

Oh, he's making effort.

1:03:26.473 --> 1:03:27.809
<i>Good. I'm happy to hear that.</i>

1:03:28.910 --> 1:03:31.178
<i>Okay.</i>
Well, we'll see you later...

1:03:31.211 --> 1:03:32.755
Oh, you've already...
You've already hung up on me.

my invasion immediately,

the first of my drone warriors.

No, no. I don't have one.

1:05:01.869 --> 1:05:03.637
Oh, I know.

1:05:03.670 --> 1:05:06.007
It was something very important.

1:05:06.040 --> 1:05:07.975
Something right under my nose.

1:05:09.409 --> 1:05:10.912
Come on, Rattle.

1:05:10.945 --> 1:05:12.713
You can remember!

1:13:54.201 --> 1:13:57.805
I've got control
of the navigation deck.

1:13:57.838 --> 1:13:59.772
Everyone, buckle up!

1:13:59.807 --> 1:14:03.077
<i>Oh! And then we have take off.</i>

1:14:03.110 --> 1:14:04.979
<i>Sit tight, while I send
Kruel's ship to a place</i>

1:14:05.012 --> 1:14:08.349
<i>where he will never
bother anyone ever again.</i>

1:14:27.968 --> 1:14:29.169
Thanks, Big Earl.

1:14:29.203 --> 1:14:31.305
This babysitter is heading home.

1:14:31.338 --> 1:14:33.907
<i>Speaking of, your
famous meatloaf</i>

1:14:33.941 --> 1:14:35.376
<i>is in the oven as we speak.</i>

1:14:35.409 --> 1:14:36.910
<i>I'll send it to you.</i>

1:14:36.944 --> 1:14:38.379
<i>Have a safe flight!</i>

1:14:40.114 --> 1:14:43.217
<i>You're all heroes.</i>

1:14:52.593 --> 1:14:55.963
Wh... wh... where am I going?

1:14:56.363 --> 1:14:58.999
Wait, no!
Oh, my God, my beautiful ship!

1:14:59.033 --> 1:15:01.935
Not my beautiful ship!

1:15:04.204 --> 1:15:10.144
♪

1:15:18.252 --> 1:15:19.586
Hi!

1:15:19.620 --> 1:15:22.623
- Hi.
- How were they?

1:15:22.656 --> 1:15:24.958
Perfect.
They didn't need me at all.

1:15:24.992 --> 1:15:27.928
Well, what did you do
while I was gone?

1:15:31.198 --> 1:15:32.599
We saved the world.

1:15:32.633 --> 1:15:34.368
Oh!

1:15:34.401 --> 1:15:36.236
Come on. Get in.

1:15:40.007 --> 1:15:41.442
Bye, you guys.

1:15:41.475 --> 1:15:43.110
- Bye.
- Till next time.

1:15:44.278 --> 1:15:45.913
Remember...

1:15:45.946 --> 1:15:47.114
- Mum's the word.
- Okay.

1:15:47.147 --> 1:15:48.449
Thank you so much.

1:16:01.061 --> 1:16:04.131
Oh... Okay,
that I do not recognize.

1:16:12.506 --> 1:16:14.308
Down boy! Nice Doggy!

1:16:16.643 --> 1:16:18.212
<i>And with that,</i>

1:16:18.245 --> 1:16:19.456
<i>all of these
so-called UFO sightings</i>

1:16:19.480 --> 1:16:21.382
<i>simply came to an abrupt halt.</i>

1:16:21.415 --> 1:16:24.084
<i>It's now speculated that the
entire incident</i>

1:16:24.118 --> 1:16:27.087
<i>was quite possibly a hoax,
followed by mass hysteria.</i>

1:16:27.121 --> 1:16:29.523
<i>So far, we've heard no comment
from Agent Action</i>

1:16:29.556 --> 1:16:32.493
<i>who, once again, has gone back
into mysterious seclusion.</i>

1:16:32.526 --> 1:16:34.495
<i>One has to wonder
if we will ever learn</i>

1:16:34.528 --> 1:16:36.964
<i>the true identity
of what is undeniably</i>

1:16:36.997 --> 1:16:39.299
<i>the world's greatest superhero.</i>

1:16:39.333 --> 1:16:42.403
<i>Thank you, Agent Action
for all you do.</i>

1:16:42.436 --> 1:16:44.405
Shucks.

1:16:46.140 --> 1:16:47.141
Oh.

1:16:50.344 --> 1:16:52.646
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
Aunt Patty, it's me, Brewster

1:16:54.081 --> 1:16:56.216
Brewster.

1:16:56.250 --> 1:16:57.451
Sorry.

1:16:58.619 --> 1:17:00.421
The heck are you dressed
like that for?

1:17:00.454 --> 1:17:02.456
I thought you were one of
Kruel's bozos.

1:17:02.489 --> 1:17:05.092
Oh, no, this is my costume
for the talent show.

1:17:05.125 --> 1:17:06.326
Talent show?

1:17:06.360 --> 1:17:07.961
Wowzer.

1:17:07.995 --> 1:17:10.531
Uh, I bet you killed it.
I bet you won.

1:17:11.198 --> 1:17:14.067
- Not exactly.
- Oh...

1:17:14.101 --> 1:17:16.003
We got beat by a dancing poodle.

1:17:16.036 --> 1:17:20.240
Oh, well, poodles
are pretty competitive.

1:17:20.274 --> 1:17:22.509
Yeah.

1:17:24.178 --> 1:17:26.480
I just wanted to stop by
and, uh, say thank you.

1:17:27.614 --> 1:17:30.717
Oh, flowers!

1:17:30.751 --> 1:17:33.153
Uh, catnip for Mr. Fluffy Pants.

1:17:33.187 --> 1:17:35.422
- Oh.
- For your cat, not Big Earl.

1:17:35.456 --> 1:17:37.090
Oh, yeah. Great.

1:17:37.124 --> 1:17:40.027
Well, thanks.

1:17:40.060 --> 1:17:43.030
No big whoop.
All in a day's work.

1:17:43.063 --> 1:17:45.232
Besides,
you're the one that saved us.

1:17:45.265 --> 1:17:47.634
I guess I'm not
the only hero in town.

1:17:49.203 --> 1:17:50.613
Yeah. I think I'm just
gonna stick to being

1:17:50.637 --> 1:17:52.039
a big brother for right now.

1:17:53.674 --> 1:17:56.577
Unless you need
a super sidekick.

1:17:56.610 --> 1:17:58.445
I mean, that suit is so epic,

1:17:58.479 --> 1:18:02.182
and we could
seriously kick some...

1:18:02.216 --> 1:18:04.117
Yeah, that... that...

1:18:04.151 --> 1:18:05.652
That's not happening.

1:18:05.686 --> 1:18:08.222
Yeah. Yeah, I didn't think so.

1:18:11.826 --> 1:18:14.261
I just wanted to say
I'm sorry for being so rude.

1:18:15.329 --> 1:18:17.598
I guess it's true what they say.

1:18:17.631 --> 1:18:19.666
You can't really judge
a book by its cover.

1:18:20.701 --> 1:18:23.203
You did not just say that.

1:18:23.237 --> 1:18:25.706
I could barely get it out.

1:18:25.739 --> 1:18:27.574
Oh!

1:18:30.812 --> 1:18:33.213
What the heck, whoa!

1:18:36.483 --> 1:18:38.252
Brewster, stay back!

1:18:41.088 --> 1:18:42.356
Now what?

1:18:42.389 --> 1:18:43.669
Hokey smokes,
we got big trouble!

1:18:46.226 --> 1:18:48.262
What the heck is that?

1:18:51.532 --> 1:18:53.534
Shut the front door.

1:18:53.567 --> 1:18:55.235
Bub?

1:18:55.269 --> 1:18:56.838
Look out!

1:18:56.871 --> 1:18:58.438
