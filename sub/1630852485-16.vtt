where the sun don't shine.

think's going on with him?

the whole way home.

Look, Judd, when I, when I
first came to look for you,

22:22.083 --> 22:25.760
I never really felt like I was
missing anything in my life...

22:26.846 --> 22:28.220
until I met you.

22:29.832 --> 22:33.759
It's like, the more
I get to know you guys,
the cooler you are

22:33.911 --> 22:37.671
and-and... the madder I get.

22:37.690 --> 22:39.982
-So you're mad?
-Yeah. 'Cause it's like...

22:41.268 --> 22:43.268
Like, where were you
that whole time, you know.

22:43.421 --> 22:46.346
'Cause that's time that
we could have spent together.

22:46.424 --> 22:48.257
But we never, we never got to
and we never will.

22:48.275 --> 22:51.518
And-and I don't, I just feel
like I got robbed of it.

22:51.596 --> 22:53.762
Wyatt, your mama did the best
that she could with you.

22:53.781 --> 22:56.356
I'm not mad at my mom! Okay?

22:56.376 --> 22:57.500
I'm-I'm just...

22:58.603 --> 22:59.960
I'm just mad.

23:02.565 --> 23:05.549
It's whatever. It's pointless.
Uh, it's not anybody's fault.

23:05.701 --> 23:07.760
So let's just forget about it,
alright?

23:12.392 --> 23:14.040
Come on.

23:14.060 --> 23:16.285
(horse neighs)

23:16.378 --> 23:19.212
Hold up a minute now, Wyatt.
Let's talk about this.

23:19.290 --> 23:20.973
What's the point?
What's the point?

23:21.125 --> 23:22.400
-Whoa, Wyatt, stop!
-(rattling)

23:22.551 --> 23:23.734
Judd, I'm not gonna
talk about it.

23:23.886 --> 23:25.477
Back up, back up, back up.

23:25.554 --> 23:26.570
Whoa.

23:26.647 --> 23:28.531

23:39.994 --> 23:40.993
Hey.

23:41.145 --> 23:42.311
You okay?

23:42.313 --> 23:44.213
Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.

23:44.982 --> 23:46.257
Did Romeo bolt on me?

23:46.408 --> 23:48.759
-Yeah.
-Oh! That coward.

23:48.761 --> 23:50.653
Do me a favor. Don't tell
your granddaddy about it.

23:50.671 --> 23:52.596
I don't think he'd ever
let me live it down.

23:52.748 --> 23:54.265
Uh...

23:54.416 --> 23:55.433
What? What?

23:57.161 --> 23:59.228
WYATT:
I don't think you're okay.

24:00.831 --> 24:02.231
No, I reckon I ain't.

24:07.596 --> 24:08.353
JUDD: Ow!

24:08.597 --> 24:10.005
-Ow!
-Oh, my God, it's really broken.

24:10.024 --> 24:11.173
What are we gonna do?
What do we do, Judd?

24:11.175 --> 24:13.025
First just slow down
your breathing

24:13.101 --> 24:13.859
or we're both gonna pass out.

24:14.102 --> 24:15.435
And then tell me
that big-ass snake

24:15.455 --> 24:18.122
-ain't around here nowhere.
-WYATT: I don't see it.

24:18.199 --> 24:19.698
JUDD:
Alright, good, keep an eye out

24:19.792 --> 24:21.417
while I call Grace.

24:21.961 --> 24:22.793
(groans)

24:22.870 --> 24:24.778
Oh, damn it.

24:24.797 --> 24:26.297
Your phone's at the house.

24:26.373 --> 24:27.856
This is bad. This is really bad.

24:27.875 --> 24:28.966
There ain't nothin'
to worry about

24:29.117 --> 24:31.043
'cause Romeo's gonna
run back to the barn,

24:31.119 --> 24:32.285
your granddaddy will come
looking for us.

24:32.379 --> 24:34.638
-How long is that gonna take?
-I don't know.

24:34.640 --> 24:36.790
There's a pocket knife
in Boone's saddlebag.

24:36.867 --> 24:37.975
Go bring it to me, please.

24:38.126 --> 24:39.477
Oh, God.

24:41.872 --> 24:43.539
I need you to cut that pant off

24:43.541 --> 24:45.983
so we can see what we're
working with right quick.

24:48.637 --> 24:49.737
(winces)

24:50.564 --> 24:52.281
Yeah! Aah...

24:53.493 --> 24:55.217
Ohh!

24:55.219 --> 24:58.704
Okay. Okay.
Let's get that boot off.

24:59.890 --> 25:01.573
Yeah, pull it off.

25:01.726 --> 25:04.576
Oh! God! God! Good God!

25:04.729 --> 25:05.986
-(groans)
-WYATT: Sorry.

25:06.063 --> 25:07.412
Good. Get that sock off.

25:07.565 --> 25:09.489
Ah, sh...

25:09.509 --> 25:13.252
Alright. That's good.
There's not a lot
of blood down there.

25:13.328 --> 25:14.753
That's not a lot of blood?

25:14.905 --> 25:17.089
Yeah, if it'd hit an artery,
you'd have just found a puddle.

25:17.165 --> 25:20.500
So, next step,
we gotta check the circulation.

25:20.520 --> 25:21.410
You ever taken a pulse?

25:21.428 --> 25:22.928
Uh, no, I don't think so, no.

25:23.080 --> 25:25.581
Easy. Take two fingers, put it
under my ankle bone right there.

25:25.599 --> 25:28.067
Should feel like
a little heartbeat.

25:28.844 --> 25:31.603
-Oh...
-I can't.

25:31.680 --> 25:33.756
I can't find... I can't find it.
I can't feel it.

25:33.758 --> 25:35.991
I can't feel your hand neither.

25:36.702 --> 25:37.535
That's not good, is it?

25:37.686 --> 25:38.702
(exhales)

25:38.929 --> 25:40.612
Okay, the reason
you can't feel a pulse

25:40.706 --> 25:43.023
is because the bone's pressed up
against the artery

25:43.042 --> 25:45.100
cutting off the blood flow.

25:45.119 --> 25:47.770
There's no circulation,
so you're gonna...

25:47.788 --> 25:50.122
-You're gonna have to reset it.
-What do you mean reset it?

25:50.274 --> 25:51.715
You're gonna have to
snap it back in place.

25:51.867 --> 25:54.218
Snap it? Like with my bare...
No, I can't do that.

25:54.295 --> 25:55.778
We gotta bring you to,
like, a hospital.

25:55.796 --> 25:57.629
I can ride the horses back
or something, but I--

25:57.706 --> 25:58.947
There ain't no time
for that, Wyatt.

25:58.966 --> 26:00.057
Wait. I don't know.
What if I make it worse?

26:00.134 --> 26:01.617
I don't know
what I'm doing, Judd.

26:01.619 --> 26:02.876
Hey, Wyatt,
look at the damn thing.

26:02.895 --> 26:04.228
You ain't gonna make it worse.

26:04.305 --> 26:05.971
I need you to grab the ankle

26:06.048 --> 26:08.399
and pull down strong and fast.

26:08.401 --> 26:10.642
And I need you to try to shift
the bone back into place.

26:10.719 --> 26:12.403
I'm gonna be sick.
I think I'm gonna be sick.

26:12.554 --> 26:15.364
Hey, hey, hey, hey, look, look,
look, look, look, look, look.

26:16.634 --> 26:19.818
I need your help, okay?

26:19.895 --> 26:21.486
-It don't gotta be perfect.
-Okay.

26:21.639 --> 26:23.138
JUDD:
Just get that bone
off the artery

26:23.140 --> 26:24.564
so we can get
the circulation going again.

26:24.584 --> 26:26.566
The doctors can take care
of the rest of it.

26:26.586 --> 26:28.252
How do I, how do I know
if I'm gonna do it right?

26:28.403 --> 26:30.979
If you do it right, I'm probably
gonna scream and pass out.

26:30.998 --> 26:32.172
But you will feel the pulse.

26:33.167 --> 26:35.426
-Wyatt, you can do it.
-Alright.

26:36.596 --> 26:37.928
Yeah. (exhales)

26:38.080 --> 26:39.096
Let's go.

-(Judd groaning)

26:43.510 --> 26:46.161
Do you want me to, like,
let you know, like, count down
or should I just surprise you?

26:46.254 --> 26:48.664
If that's easy for you,
count from three or something.
