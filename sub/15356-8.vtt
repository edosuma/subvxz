WEBVTT

00:54.550 --> 00:55.940
Stop right there!

01:03.940 --> 01:05.340
Stop!

01:10.260 --> 01:12.680
I'm warning you.
Stop what you're doing!

02:29.141 --> 02:29.981
[Episode 8]

02:31.250 --> 02:33.900
Sir...
Sir, are you okay?

02:39.500 --> 02:40.999
Is Candidate Seo okay?

02:41.000 --> 02:42.619
I think he is.

02:42.620 --> 02:44.989
The kidnapper escaped towards Exit 3.

02:44.990 --> 02:46.489
Tell the police to block Exit 3.

02:46.490 --> 02:49.480
The suspect is headed towards Exit 3,
block it.

02:58.720 --> 03:01.770
Ahjussi... please pick up.

03:18.490 --> 03:20.810
Why is the ambulance so late?

03:21.010 --> 03:24.600
Honey. Honey, wake up.

03:29.330 --> 03:30.349
Where are we?

03:30.350 --> 03:32.649
Honey, are you okay?

03:32.650 --> 03:35.709
Sir, the ambulance will be here soon.
You have to be treated.

03:35.710 --> 03:37.139
What about the campaign conference?

03:37.140 --> 03:40.329
Due to your attempted kidnapping,
it's going to be postponed.

03:40.330 --> 03:43.239
Postponed?
On whose orders?

03:43.240 --> 03:44.569
I'm totally fine!

03:44.570 --> 03:47.230
Sir, in your current condition,
you can't give a speech.

03:47.250 --> 03:49.749
Move!
I can do it.

03:49.750 --> 03:51.511
I was the victim
of a kidnapping and a sniper attack.

03:51.512 --> 03:53.869
This is the best time to earn votes.

03:53.870 --> 03:56.109
I can do it!
Let's go.

03:56.110 --> 03:57.540
- Sir.
- Honey.

03:59.450 --> 04:01.040
Prosecutor Kim.

04:01.310 --> 04:07.070
Stop trying to catch me
and go after the people who attacked me!

04:07.660 --> 04:09.140
Brainless Jerk...

04:17.050 --> 04:22.469
After being shot at and kidnapped,

04:22.470 --> 04:24.849
Why am I still standing here, you may ask?

04:24.850 --> 04:27.339
Because I'm crazy about being president?

04:27.340 --> 04:28.449
No.

04:28.450 --> 04:32.346
Currently, many issues still exist
in terms of our national defense.

04:32.347 --> 04:34.047
We still have a ways to go.

04:34.280 --> 04:35.726
Due to people who assert

04:35.727 --> 04:38.027
that all is well because they themselves
are well-fed and content,

04:38.080 --> 04:42.040
the 38th Parallel* is in imminent danger.
(*demarcates N. and S. Korea across the DMZ)

04:42.240 --> 04:48.220
If not for me, Seo Yong Hak, this
country's safety would be severed, Everyone!

04:50.690 --> 04:53.669
Seo Yong Hak. Seo Yong Hak.

04:53.870 --> 04:56.589
Seo Yong Hak. Seo Yong Hak.

04:56.790 --> 04:59.489
Seo Yong Hak. Seo Yong Hak.

04:59.690 --> 05:02.389
Seo Yong Hak. Seo Yong Hak.

05:02.590 --> 05:03.759
Seo Yong Hak.

05:18.940 --> 05:19.759
Did you find out?

05:19.760 --> 05:23.809
There was a gunshot,
but I don't think the police caught him.

05:23.810 --> 05:24.910
Then?

05:25.620 --> 05:28.200
I think he escaped with an injury.

05:28.540 --> 05:31.880
The police are sending
their best team after him.

05:51.120 --> 05:52.989
Have you sent a sample of the blood in?

05:52.990 --> 05:54.349
Yes, we sent it to forensics.

05:54.350 --> 05:57.269
Since we can't find the bullet,
I'm sure he was hit.

05:57.270 --> 05:58.859
As soon as you have the results,

05:58.860 --> 06:01.939
run it through the database
to see if we can get a DNA match.

06:01.940 --> 06:05.419
And to track him down, look through
all security cameras in the area.

06:05.420 --> 06:08.089
Streets, hospitals, pharmacies...
Ask for people's cooperation.

06:08.090 --> 06:09.649
Put out a full search.

06:09.650 --> 06:13.260
Okay.
Do you think it can be Steve Lee?

06:13.580 --> 06:17.779
I don't think so, none of the witnesses
reported that the kidnapper had a bad leg.

06:17.780 --> 06:23.090
Oh, according to the police, they've
never seen a knot tied like this before.

06:23.460 --> 06:26.218
Yeah?
Investigate that too.

07:26.780 --> 07:30.880
Jin Sae Hee,
you can't return this after tomorrow.

08:06.360 --> 08:07.760
Yoon Sung...

08:13.880 --> 08:19.040
Can you repay the favor you owe me today?

09:00.170 --> 09:03.580
We only have animal medicine.
It's okay, right?

09:04.230 --> 09:08.830
Don't worry, the medicine is the same,
just the dosage is different.

09:10.520 --> 09:12.230
You stitched it well, right?

09:12.760 --> 09:15.520
I'm going to spread rumors
you're a bad doctor if it leaves a scar.

09:16.010 --> 09:18.099
It looks like you're going to live.

09:18.100 --> 09:23.979
Fever... You're okay..
I think you'll be fine.

09:23.980 --> 09:27.419
Why... aren't you asking?

09:27.420 --> 09:30.000
What?
The wound?

09:30.810 --> 09:33.268
Hiding at an animal hospital
instead of going to an actual hospital...

09:33.303 --> 09:35.061
You must have a reason.

09:35.062 --> 09:38.770
A long time ago I treated a dog
that was shot by an air gun.

09:39.220 --> 09:41.190
Your wound looks somewhat similar.

09:43.410 --> 09:45.919
Watch some TV and relax.

09:45.920 --> 09:49.389
<i>Candidate Seo Yong Hak was almost
kidnapped today during the ceremony.</i>

09:49.390 --> 09:52.609
<i>Thanks to the security agents,
the kidnapping was foiled.</i>

09:52.610 --> 09:57.599
<i>The suspect, however,
escaped after being wounded by a gunshot.</i>

09:57.600 --> 09:59.950
<i>This is Reporter Lee Min Joon.</i>

10:06.860 --> 10:09.010
The police are busy.

10:10.330 --> 10:13.610
I think it's best
for you to sleep here tonight.

10:18.300 --> 10:20.700
[Father]

10:28.850 --> 10:29.609
Yes.

10:29.610 --> 10:31.579
You should have killed the agent.

10:31.580 --> 10:34.450
You should have eliminated the agent
so you wouldn't get shot!

10:35.190 --> 10:36.599
I'm sorry.

10:36.600 --> 10:38.280
<i>You're so weak.</i>

10:38.540 --> 10:40.600
How's your injury?

10:41.360 --> 10:43.889
I'm okay, the bullet just grazed me.

10:43.890 --> 10:45.930
Get over here immediately.

10:46.610 --> 10:47.650
Okay.

10:50.270 --> 10:53.740
All of a sudden, why does it feel like
I've become a star in a movie?

11:31.210 --> 11:32.890
He's still not back?

13:05.890 --> 13:11.390
Shoot... Shoot!
What are you waiting for?!

14:56.760 --> 15:00.390
Didn't come home... Didn't come home!

15:00.990 --> 15:02.601
I see.

15:02.636 --> 15:06.449
You're a man...
and not any man...

15:06.520 --> 15:10.229
but the Master of One Night Stands,
a man who is busy every night.

15:10.230 --> 15:11.883
The night doesn't make up
all 24 hours of a day

15:11.918 --> 15:14.827
for a man who resents, and resents,
and resents.

15:15.790 --> 15:19.310
Yeah, good for you, for being good-looking
and cool, you Unlucky Jerk.

15:31.680 --> 15:35.530
There's nothing going right this morning
because of that unlucky jerk.

15:56.870 --> 16:00.289
Exactly what kind of a man are you,
Lee Yoon Sung?

16:00.290 --> 16:01.910
A dangerous man...

16:03.310 --> 16:05.060
You have to go to work.

16:05.520 --> 16:07.189
I thought you might need this.

16:07.190 --> 16:10.200
I brought some clothes that Young Joo
didn't take when he left.

16:11.410 --> 16:16.290
Did I not tell you?
Prosecutor Kim is my ex-husband.

16:17.270 --> 16:21.750
I thought you'd be around the same size,
so I brought it.

16:31.820 --> 16:34.160
It's all done.

16:35.110 --> 16:38.220
Be careful, the wound isn't minor.

16:38.550 --> 16:39.850
Thank you.

16:42.330 --> 16:45.260
These wounds must have hurt a lot...

16:50.790 --> 16:54.280
Don't forget to take the medicine
30 minutes after your meal and...

16:55.030 --> 16:58.270
You know our hospital
doesn't accept insurance, right?

16:58.390 --> 16:59.090
Excuse me?

16:59.091 --> 17:03.259
I think your weight and a golden retriever's
are about the same,

17:03.260 --> 17:06.630
so I'll charge you the same price...
50,000 won.

17:06.900 --> 17:10.940
Of course you can substitute
with an expensive dinner or alcohol.

17:10.970 --> 17:14.289
Oh... you're hurt so no alcohol.

17:14.290 --> 17:18.510
Scary...
I'll repay you properly next time.

17:27.869 --> 17:30.320
Be careful of your wound.

17:31.820 --> 17:32.950
Okay.

17:50.880 --> 17:53.030
- Seriously, come on...
- I'm sorry.

17:54.600 --> 17:56.240
You should look where you're going.

18:08.820 --> 18:10.160
Kim Na Na.

18:11.900 --> 18:14.480
- Hey, Kim Na Na.
- Let go.

18:15.370 --> 18:18.310
- Hey, Kim Na Na.
- I said let go.

18:19.230 --> 18:20.950
Let's talk.

18:28.720 --> 18:30.770
I told you I didn't want to.

18:35.540 --> 18:38.409
Did you do something wrong?
Why are you running away?

18:38.410 --> 18:41.820
I'm not running away.
I was leaving because I was late.

18:42.710 --> 18:44.310
You're assuming things again, aren't you?

18:44.600 --> 18:48.539
Assuming what?
That repertoire is old, change it up.

18:48.540 --> 18:49.799
It's really a misunderstanding.

18:49.800 --> 18:52.539
You're so worried
and you date openly in the neighborhood?

18:52.540 --> 18:55.310
What do you think the neighbors are going
to say about Sae Hee unni behind her back?

18:55.530 --> 18:59.320
Then again, I don't even know
if it's a misunderstanding or the truth now.

18:59.330 --> 19:03.930
You... Do you like me?

19:05.340 --> 19:08.919
Who would like an unlucky jerk like you?

19:08.920 --> 19:12.060
Isn't it a little funny that you're
so interested in my private life?

19:12.110 --> 19:13.979
That's overdoing it,
it's presumptuous.

19:13.980 --> 19:16.610
I'm sorry I'm doing things
that are presumptuous.

19:16.760 --> 19:19.620
I was worried people will find out
you didn't go home last night...

19:20.280 --> 19:22.410
It was stupid of me
to bring clothes for you.

19:25.340 --> 19:29.289
Look at your fashion sense.
Do you think that tie goes with that suit?

19:29.290 --> 19:31.899
I think you have clothes at your house
to change into too,

19:31.900 --> 19:35.090
so go change into a "senseful" attire
that you choose.

19:35.100 --> 19:37.120
I'm late, so I'm leaving.

20:00.140 --> 20:04.750
Kim Na Na, great job.
I heard you shot him.

20:04.790 --> 20:06.359
It's hard to hit a moving target.

20:06.360 --> 20:08.520
The practices helped.

20:10.170 --> 20:13.659
Look, look. Everyone shoot
as if that's the City Hunter.

20:13.660 --> 20:17.390
Shoot with the mentality
that if you miss your shot, we'll all die.

20:25.310 --> 20:26.560
Chest.

20:29.370 --> 20:30.500
Neck.

20:49.650 --> 20:50.790
What?

20:51.960 --> 20:53.290
Nothing.

21:17.040 --> 21:20.950
Go Ki Joon, you have to make at least
one shot to either the chest or neck.

21:23.280 --> 21:26.580
Do you like being an agent?

21:29.730 --> 21:32.619
What about teaching kids
at a judo academy instead?

21:32.620 --> 21:34.259
What are you trying to say?

21:34.260 --> 21:37.360
How many girls in Korea
do you think shoot guns?

21:38.030 --> 21:40.479
If he had a gun, you would have gotten shot.

21:40.480 --> 21:42.559
A person who's so worried about me

21:42.560 --> 21:45.250
didn't even bother to call me once
last night and was out dating instead?

21:45.280 --> 21:46.590
Kim Na Na.

21:47.940 --> 21:50.620
I should have caught the City Hunter
yesterday.

21:51.400 --> 21:55.720
Do you think the City Hunter...
is a bad person?

21:55.830 --> 22:00.510
Well, I have to protect
Candidate Seo Yong Hak.

22:00.610 --> 22:02.460
That's my job.

22:14.590 --> 22:15.829
Prosecutor.

22:15.830 --> 22:19.799
The CCTVs along the kidnapper's escape route
were all shut off during that time,

22:19.800 --> 22:21.479
- so we couldn't check it.
- What?

22:21.480 --> 22:25.209
What's weirder is only the ones
the police are plugged into were off.

22:25.210 --> 22:28.459
CCTV from the nearby convenience store,
jewelry store, and bank were all okay.

22:28.460 --> 22:32.969
The police said it's because
their CCTV control program was hacked...

22:32.970 --> 22:35.189
It seems the IP address
traces back to the Blue House.

22:35.190 --> 22:36.639
Blue House IP?

22:36.640 --> 22:42.440
The IP used to air Lee Kyung Wan's
video clip was also from the Blue House.

22:42.870 --> 22:44.060
Let's go.

22:47.090 --> 22:50.560
Hello, I'm Prosecutor Kim
from the Seoul District Prosecutor's Office.

22:54.680 --> 22:57.209
Prosecutor, you're here often.

22:57.210 --> 22:59.999
You know about yesterday's kidnapping
incident involving Candidate Seo Yong Hak

23:00.000 --> 23:02.319
during the New People's Party
nomination event, right?

23:02.320 --> 23:04.999
Yes, I saw the news.

23:05.000 --> 23:08.620
We tried to look at the CCTV
to investigate the suspect,

23:08.621 --> 23:13.189
but the police CCTV control computer
was hacked and so everything was shut off.

23:13.190 --> 23:14.159
Hacking?

23:14.160 --> 23:15.859
Lee Kyung Wan's incident...

23:15.860 --> 23:17.739
and the recent
police security camera hacking...

23:17.740 --> 23:20.499
were all traced
to an IP here in the Blue House.

23:20.500 --> 23:24.240
A Blue House IP?

23:25.100 --> 23:28.390
It's not me...
It's really not me.

23:32.100 --> 23:35.410
I want to know whose IP address this is.

23:37.850 --> 23:41.630
The address is from here but...

23:42.990 --> 23:48.699
we don't have individual addresses
so we don't know whose it is.

23:48.700 --> 23:50.060
I see.

23:50.400 --> 23:53.319
Then there's no other way but to seize
all the computers in this department.

23:53.320 --> 23:57.649
All the computers from this department?
Then how are we supposed to work?

23:57.650 --> 24:00.419
This might paralyze the entire nation's
communication network.

24:00.420 --> 24:05.049
Okay, then divide it up into thirds and send
the computers to the Prosecutor's Office.

24:05.050 --> 24:07.529
Of course, you can pull all files
involving national intelligence.

24:07.530 --> 24:10.979
We just have to find out
who hacked into the police cameras.

24:10.980 --> 24:14.439
We will cooperate with that.

24:14.440 --> 24:16.110
Thank you.

25:23.490 --> 25:24.699
I feel uneasy.

25:24.700 --> 25:26.466
We're busy enough as it is,

25:26.467 --> 25:29.721
without having to remove
all the government files from the computers.

25:29.790 --> 25:31.780
I wonder who did it?

25:33.220 --> 25:34.899
Could it be Kim Min Ho?

25:34.900 --> 25:37.629
He was complaining last time
that he got caught for drunk driving.

25:37.630 --> 25:40.499
He has a lot of complaints about the police.

25:40.500 --> 25:42.919
He was upset they couldn't catch
the robber that was in his house.

25:42.920 --> 25:45.229
Is it by any chance... you?

25:45.230 --> 25:48.079
You're a genius at hacking
and there's that case from before.

25:48.080 --> 25:49.279
Cold.

25:49.280 --> 25:50.569
Are you crazy?

25:50.570 --> 25:53.260
I thought I'd go crazy from being
in that detention center for just two days.

26:04.810 --> 26:06.360
That suit...

26:07.130 --> 26:08.640
That tie...

26:10.980 --> 26:15.310
Yes, it's yours.
I got it from Director Jin Sae Hee.

26:21.220 --> 26:25.970
You, are you always this casual?
With all women?

26:27.310 --> 26:30.105
I had a reason to borrow it.

26:30.890 --> 26:34.360
It's a little unpleasant
to hear you say "casual."

26:34.590 --> 26:37.020
- What's your definition of casual?
- What?

26:37.310 --> 26:39.119
Luckily it's not really my style.

26:39.120 --> 26:42.590
Besides, I don't like wearing other people's
stuff so I'm not going to wear it again.

26:43.300 --> 26:46.279
But, isn't it a little funny

26:46.860 --> 26:49.870
to be so interested
in a relationship that's already over?

26:50.760 --> 26:52.090
Sae Hee...

26:52.410 --> 26:55.569
Sae Hee is someone to be pitied!

26:55.570 --> 26:58.320
She has to meet someone good,
not someone like you.

26:58.520 --> 26:59.419
What wrong with me?

26:59.420 --> 27:03.189
She's too innocent for someone like you
to just play with and throw away.

27:03.190 --> 27:05.380
Who says I'm playing with her?!

27:08.810 --> 27:13.290
You... Aren't you actually scared
that I'm sincere?

27:13.870 --> 27:16.099
Clean up your own feelings.

27:16.100 --> 27:18.456
I'm not the one skulking around
in the shadows,

27:18.457 --> 27:22.106
acting as "Long Leg Ahjussi*."
(*benefactor)

27:31.150 --> 27:35.010
Prosecutor, we got 1/3 of the computers.
Let's go.

27:37.500 --> 27:41.070
- Oh, my gosh.
- Wow. Geez. That smell!

27:53.980 --> 27:55.340
Ahjussi.

27:56.260 --> 27:57.710
Yoon Sung...

27:57.950 --> 27:59.340
Yoon Sung...

28:00.930 --> 28:01.709
Are you okay?

28:01.710 --> 28:03.839
Yeah, I'm okay...
I'm sorry.

28:03.840 --> 28:06.419
Hold on, I smell...

28:06.420 --> 28:07.850
It's okay.

28:07.910 --> 28:09.839
Yoon Sung.

28:09.840 --> 28:11.019
Thank you for coming back alive.

28:11.020 --> 28:13.079
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

28:13.080 --> 28:15.069
Smell...
The smell is kind of bad.

28:15.070 --> 28:17.620
Everyone is running away from me.

28:22.590 --> 28:24.269
I told you this wasn't the way to do it!

28:24.270 --> 28:26.089
Because of your juvenile methods,

28:26.090 --> 28:29.740
instead of giving Seo Yong Hak a bullet,
you gave him wings!

28:30.740 --> 28:34.570
Have you forgotten
how your father died 28 years ago?

28:35.120 --> 28:36.580
I'm sorry.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.300
I don't want to lose you too.

28:42.960 --> 28:46.930
Your emotional way of doing things
is wasted on them.

28:48.800 --> 28:50.110
Your injury?

28:51.900 --> 28:52.999
I'm okay.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.830
It's still a gunshot wound.

28:54.950 --> 28:57.999
Leave it.
I'll take care of this one myself.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.920
No... I'll do it.

29:00.980 --> 29:05.240
This isn't just your revenge.
It's my father's revenge too.

29:07.670 --> 29:09.765
Fine, I'll trust you.

29:09.766 --> 29:13.924
However, I won't tolerate a second mistake.

29:14.920 --> 29:15.980
Yes.

29:16.520 --> 29:17.940
- Boss.
- What?

29:18.210 --> 29:21.220
If you're done, let's have a meeting.

29:22.190 --> 29:27.170
Yoon Sung has plans for the live broadcast
candidate debate, so I'll explain it to you.

29:32.110 --> 29:35.029
The live debate will take place
on the 5th floor in Studio B,

29:35.030 --> 29:37.099
and the two control rooms
are on the 12th floor.

29:37.100 --> 29:40.593
Yoon Sung can get from the 12th floor
to the 5th within 2 minutes

29:40.594 --> 29:41.589
via the emergency stairs.

29:41.590 --> 29:45.779
But the problem is,
we could lose Seo Yong Hak at the studio.

29:45.780 --> 29:49.209
I can catch him if he flees to the
underground garage where I'll be on standby,

29:49.210 --> 29:50.499
but if he escapes towards the front door...

29:50.500 --> 29:53.120
There will be a lot of security guards.

29:54.470 --> 29:56.379
It won't be easy.

29:56.380 --> 29:57.529
Right?

29:57.530 --> 29:59.653
And since they didn't catch Yoon Sung
last time,

29:59.681 --> 30:01.915
they'll be even more likely
to open fire on him.

30:01.920 --> 30:05.530
We have to hope there are no agents
running in, willing to risk their lives.

30:06.470 --> 30:07.849
If there is?

30:07.850 --> 30:11.190
Do you think someone who shot once
can't shoot again?

30:11.880 --> 30:14.930
If anyone gets in the way,
get rid of him.

30:15.180 --> 30:16.559
You want to kill that person?

30:16.560 --> 30:19.029
You want to kill an innocent person
to catch Seo Yong Hak?

30:19.030 --> 30:21.029
There are 20 innocent people who died...

30:21.030 --> 30:25.040
who did nothing but
put their lives on the line for the country.

30:26.290 --> 30:27.690
Don't forget.

30:35.230 --> 30:38.049
It seems fine.

30:38.050 --> 30:40.150
You have to succeed.

30:53.160 --> 30:54.290
Why?

30:54.700 --> 30:56.140
Is it that hard?

30:56.510 --> 30:57.639
Should I feed you?

30:57.640 --> 30:59.960
No, it's not that bad.

31:01.300 --> 31:03.389
Your life here is just like in Thailand...

31:03.390 --> 31:05.951
You get beat up then eat,
get beat up then eat.

31:07.450 --> 31:11.210
But... who is the agent who shot you?

31:12.010 --> 31:13.230
Na Na.

31:13.540 --> 31:16.930
Na Na?!
Na Na shot you?

31:18.550 --> 31:19.880
Did she see you?

31:20.160 --> 31:23.879
I don't think she saw clearly.
It doesn't seem like she suspects anything.

31:23.880 --> 31:26.199
That's a relief.

31:26.200 --> 31:27.460
Na Na...

31:28.740 --> 31:31.430
We have to stop her from
guarding Seo Yong Hak.

31:31.570 --> 31:34.439
Yeah...
This time it's going to be really dangerous.

31:34.440 --> 31:38.489
You saw Boss's stare, right?
Every time I see that, I get chills.

31:38.490 --> 31:43.490
Last time, I pretended to make a mistake,
and accidentally hurt Na Na's ankle.

31:43.670 --> 31:44.639
Should I try that again?

31:44.640 --> 31:48.240
If you don't control your strength right,
you might break her leg.

31:49.760 --> 31:52.179
Then, should I put laxatives in her food?

31:52.180 --> 31:53.370
Laxatives?

31:53.640 --> 31:54.419
It's okay, right?

31:54.420 --> 31:57.749
But it isn't good for a woman to go in
and out of the restroom because of diarrhea.

31:57.750 --> 32:00.400
We have to do something...

32:00.880 --> 32:03.400
Yoon Sung, what about this?

32:04.290 --> 32:09.139
You know the roof?
We'll go up there and drop...

32:09.140 --> 32:11.700
What if she dies?!

32:12.570 --> 32:14.340
Why isn't she here?

32:14.530 --> 32:17.279
Ahjussi, no matter how I think about it,
I don't think this is the solution.

32:17.280 --> 32:18.729
It's better than laxatives.

32:18.730 --> 32:21.139
A woman going in and out
of the restroom because of diarrhea...

32:21.140 --> 32:22.859
What if we do it wrong
and something bad happens...

32:22.860 --> 32:25.580
- what are we going to do?
- It won't, it won't.

32:26.630 --> 32:28.120
She's here.
That's her, right?

32:32.040 --> 32:34.370
Ahjussi, what are you doing?
That's a brick.

32:34.410 --> 32:37.190
A brick...
Oh, I got too excited.

32:38.200 --> 32:40.579
Ahjussi, you can't do that either.
She's going to die.

32:40.580 --> 32:41.689
No.
It's okay, Yoon Sung...

32:41.690 --> 32:42.949
- I said no.
- Yoon Sung, hurry...

32:42.950 --> 32:44.570
She won't die.

32:51.270 --> 32:52.600
That hurts.

32:53.250 --> 32:54.870
Who's there?

32:55.040 --> 32:57.150
- My shoulder...
- You okay?

32:58.180 --> 32:59.810
You don't think she's dead, right...?

33:01.650 --> 33:03.730
You're all dead!

33:05.450 --> 33:06.800
She's fine.

33:07.500 --> 33:08.890
Let's run for it.

33:10.050 --> 33:13.099
3 iced caramel macchiato
and 1 iced Americano.

33:13.100 --> 33:15.030
Yes, thank you.

33:17.380 --> 33:19.829
Kim Na Na, you're the only one
who ordered iced Americano, right?

33:19.830 --> 33:20.960
Yes.

33:27.130 --> 33:29.130
Even if your stomach hurts, too bad.

33:29.210 --> 33:30.890
I have to do this so you can live.

33:35.640 --> 33:37.909
This is Kim Na Na's.

33:37.910 --> 33:41.339
This is Agent Kim's,
this is the child's, and this is mine.

33:41.340 --> 33:42.480
Straw.

33:49.180 --> 33:50.429
<i>Drink it.</i>

33:50.430 --> 33:54.310
<i>Kim Na Na, drink, drink, drink.</i>

33:54.670 --> 33:56.570
<i>Drink it, hurry.</i>

33:58.410 --> 34:00.599
Why does this look better suddenly?

34:00.600 --> 34:02.839
Agent Kim...
We can switch, right?

34:02.840 --> 34:04.520
Okay, whatever.

34:13.690 --> 34:15.420
It's really refreshing.

34:16.940 --> 34:19.279
Teacher, since we're done studying,

34:19.280 --> 34:22.248
let's go to a karaoke, to celebrate my
scoring 20 points higher on the mock exam.

34:22.250 --> 34:23.859
We can go, right?
Right?

34:23.860 --> 34:26.569
Hey, Child.
Why would I go there? Get off.

34:26.570 --> 34:29.049
- Let's go...
- Get off, quickly.

34:29.050 --> 34:30.438
You drank it all?

34:30.440 --> 34:31.549
I'm not going.

34:31.550 --> 34:32.659
Let's go.

34:32.659 --> 34:34.840
- Let go.
- Come on, let's go.

34:59.300 --> 35:03.529
Teacher, I'm crying.
The song was sad, right?

35:03.530 --> 35:05.780
I think your grades are sadder.

35:10.710 --> 35:13.099
<i>I'm at the ManJum Karaoke, room 35.</i>

35:13.100 --> 35:14.519
I came, so you're good, right?

35:14.520 --> 35:16.450
Go ahead and play more if you want.

35:16.480 --> 35:17.449
That's against the rules.

35:17.450 --> 35:20.520
If you come with us,
you have to leave with us.

35:20.740 --> 35:23.510
Hey, give it.
Give it.

35:25.810 --> 35:28.990
Agent Kim, I have to go to the restroom.

35:29.360 --> 35:30.840
Unni, are you sick?

35:31.210 --> 35:34.809
We're going to go to the restroom,
so pick a song while we're there.

35:34.810 --> 35:38.660
If you leave,
I'll never return this.

35:39.270 --> 35:40.870
Unni, let's go.

35:45.080 --> 35:50.200
Geez, why did Agent Shin drink that?
Kim Na Na should have.

35:54.720 --> 35:57.489
Yeah Ahjussi, Room 35?

36:01.500 --> 36:02.209
Did you buy the medicine?

36:02.210 --> 36:03.489
I did.

36:03.490 --> 36:06.890
Are you okay?
Look at you.

36:08.920 --> 36:11.250
It's infected.

36:11.800 --> 36:13.120
I'm okay.

36:14.950 --> 36:18.149
What are you going to do in this state?
Let's just give up.

36:18.150 --> 36:20.870
No.
I have to do it.

36:21.700 --> 36:23.000
Don't tell Father.

36:23.220 --> 36:27.820
Aigoo... I can't sleep at night
worrying about you and the boss.

36:28.160 --> 36:31.500
I felt more at ease
while we were at the Triangle.

36:31.720 --> 36:36.309
My father died unfairly,
I have to avenge his death.

36:36.310 --> 36:40.560
Stop it! I can't do it any longer
because I'm so worried.

36:40.760 --> 36:43.769
I think the boss is also worried
because he lost so much weight.

36:43.770 --> 36:45.329
I've been making him food
for the past couple of days.

36:45.330 --> 36:47.650
Ahjussi, you're doing so much.

36:48.370 --> 36:53.039
You have laxatives left, right?
You have to take Na Na out of this.

36:53.040 --> 36:55.260
If she gets caught by the boss,
she's dead.

36:57.880 --> 36:59.980
I got the building access cards.

37:00.040 --> 37:01.500
You already got them?

37:02.070 --> 37:03.799
It's not horrible like the ones before,
right?

37:03.800 --> 37:08.910
Hey! I played a little poker
at the place where the broadcasters go.

37:09.230 --> 37:10.149
Nicely done.

37:10.150 --> 37:14.070
The owners are going to be in Australia
for a couple of weeks. It's safe.

37:24.630 --> 37:26.710
Agent Shin, are you okay?

37:26.750 --> 37:28.960
I'm a little better.

37:30.100 --> 37:32.529
It's not like I ate something bad.

37:32.530 --> 37:33.980
I wonder what's wrong.

37:34.350 --> 37:37.799
Da Hye, don't think about doing anything.
I'll be waiting outside.

37:37.800 --> 37:41.880
I won't, I won't. Why would I run away
when Teacher is here?

37:42.070 --> 37:45.559
Don't worry about things here,
I'll watch over her.

37:45.560 --> 37:46.620
Okay.

37:51.970 --> 37:53.400
My stomach...

37:53.750 --> 37:56.980
Do your thing when the restroom is empty,
don't worry about me.

38:14.350 --> 38:17.650
That guy... Bae Man Deok

38:19.010 --> 38:20.420
Hey!

38:21.750 --> 38:24.589
What a jerk. Why do I have to pay
for the entire karaoke fee?

38:24.590 --> 38:26.249
If there's a delay,
then they should have taken the subway.

38:26.250 --> 38:27.469
How is that my fault?

38:27.470 --> 38:28.979
It's entirely the president's fault.

38:28.980 --> 38:30.909
If he was doing a good job,
why would there be any protests?

38:30.910 --> 38:32.349
It's because of the protests...

38:32.350 --> 38:34.219
that they blocked the roads,
so everyone has to take the subways.

38:34.220 --> 38:36.789
Decrease the unemployment rate
of young people to 0 percent?

38:36.790 --> 38:39.309
He lied just to become president.

38:39.310 --> 38:41.550
You voted for him
because you believed it, right?

38:41.990 --> 38:43.390
You're so gullible.

38:43.570 --> 38:46.789
I can't even find a job and I have to figure
out a way to earn some spending money.

38:46.790 --> 38:48.259
Such a pain...

38:48.260 --> 38:51.729
But I bet he's going to get
his frivolous youngest daughter hired.

38:51.730 --> 38:53.659
Hired?
Yeah, right.

38:53.660 --> 38:55.509
She can't even read Korean.

38:55.510 --> 38:58.650
I heard she couldn't even get into college.
What an embarrassment.

39:00.550 --> 39:01.709
Excuse me.

39:01.710 --> 39:03.759
Do you know the president's daughter well?

39:03.760 --> 39:05.609
How do you know she can't read Korean?

39:05.610 --> 39:07.429
The entire world knows...

39:07.430 --> 39:10.209
Are you the president's youngest daughter
or something?

39:10.210 --> 39:12.929
Yes, I'm the president's youngest daughter.

39:12.930 --> 39:14.599
Then I'm the president's oldest daughter.

39:14.600 --> 39:16.239
I don't have an older sister.

39:16.240 --> 39:19.739
Da Hye, stop it.
Excuse me, let's stop this.

39:19.740 --> 39:22.760
- Who the heck are you?
- I'm a special service agent.

39:23.180 --> 39:25.399
Are you guys playing
a Blue House game together?

39:25.400 --> 39:27.699
Did you both escape
from the psychiatric ward together?!

39:27.700 --> 39:29.050
Hey!

39:30.670 --> 39:33.919
- Are you crazy?
- Don't bash on my dad!

39:33.920 --> 39:35.399
I know how to read Korean!

39:35.400 --> 39:39.850
My dad has a conscience, so he would
never use his connections to get me a job!

39:43.290 --> 39:44.650
Hey!

39:54.050 --> 39:56.290
Don't do this.

40:02.680 --> 40:05.850
No... stop it.

40:08.960 --> 40:10.660
Bae Man Deok

40:37.720 --> 40:41.300
What is this?!
You were not doing your job.

40:42.910 --> 40:45.489
Kim Na Na...
Do you have someone watching your back?

40:45.490 --> 40:47.959
What were you doing
that you weren't doing your job?

40:47.960 --> 40:49.439
I'm... I'm sorry.

40:49.440 --> 40:52.099
Do you think since I keep saying "great job"
that you're actually doing a great job?

40:52.100 --> 40:54.539
I felt bad that Kim Min Ho sunbae
has been in the hospital all this time.

40:54.540 --> 40:55.273
You applied 3 times,

40:55.274 --> 40:56.965
you're the daughter of a colleague,
and you looked pitiful, so I hired you.

40:57.000 --> 40:58.199
Do you think being a security agent
is a joke?

40:58.200 --> 40:59.499
Is it a game?

40:59.500 --> 41:00.719
It's not.

41:00.720 --> 41:03.124
How can I assign you
to guard important figures,

41:03.125 --> 41:04.954
if you can't even take care
of your personal issues?

41:05.100 --> 41:08.230
Who would trust you
and ask you to guard their life?!

41:09.910 --> 41:14.209
This video clip is all over YouTube
and it's the #1 search on the internet.

41:14.210 --> 41:15.969
It's of the president's youngest daughter.

41:15.970 --> 41:18.609
You have disgraced
the Security Service!

41:18.610 --> 41:23.120
I'm sorry.
I'll make sure this will never happen again.

41:23.480 --> 41:26.609
Shin Eun Ah.
One month pay cut.

41:26.610 --> 41:29.250
- Chief...
- What do you mean chief?!

41:30.610 --> 41:31.900
Kim Na Na.

41:32.630 --> 41:33.479
Yes.

41:33.480 --> 41:37.820
Your pay is reduced for six months
and suspended for two weeks, no pay.

41:39.390 --> 41:43.019
Six months? Suspended?

41:43.020 --> 41:46.000
You have a problem?
Then write a resignation letter!

41:46.830 --> 41:48.510
No...

41:56.310 --> 41:57.820
Hey, Kim Na Na.

41:58.810 --> 42:00.409
Leave me alone.

42:00.410 --> 42:02.160
I heard you were suspended.

42:02.810 --> 42:06.460
You should go home and get some rest
and do some cleaning. The place is a mess.

42:08.930 --> 42:14.890
Lee Yoon Sung, you know exactly how I feel,
how can you tell me to clean?

42:17.150 --> 42:19.929
That's why I told you to get some rest too.

42:19.930 --> 42:22.950
A guy like you is really the worst.

42:32.120 --> 42:36.910
You have no idea how grateful I am
about your suspension.

42:51.250 --> 42:53.260
What happened?

42:53.630 --> 42:57.839
How did my dad, the victim, become
the guilty party who caused the accident?

42:57.840 --> 43:00.479
This guy said he was under the influence
of alcohol and got the cars confused.

43:00.480 --> 43:02.339
Your father was the one who was speeding

43:02.340 --> 43:05.200
and the other guy was the one who braked
to prevent a crash.

43:05.960 --> 43:07.450
No way...

43:09.480 --> 43:12.389
Ahjussi, try to remember correctly.

43:12.390 --> 43:14.969
You saw my dad's car get hit that day.

43:14.970 --> 43:17.129
Why are you suddenly saying this?!

43:17.130 --> 43:20.419
I'm just saying what I saw...

43:20.420 --> 43:22.889
Yeah... I was...
I was under the influence that day so yes...

43:22.890 --> 43:25.669
It was the white car
that crashed into the other car.

43:25.670 --> 43:29.139
The black car didn't do anything wrong...

43:29.140 --> 43:32.902
- That's not true!
- Hey! Adults are talking.

43:32.903 --> 43:35.021
I can go now, right?

43:35.030 --> 43:38.680
Bae Man Deok, review this
and please sign it.

43:42.210 --> 43:43.990
Have a good day.

43:50.140 --> 43:53.230
No way... No way...

44:16.980 --> 44:19.030
It was definitely that guy.

44:20.140 --> 44:24.540
If I find that man,
then there can be a reinvestigation.

44:26.620 --> 44:29.879
I heard that Bae Man Deok's ID number
was erased.

44:29.880 --> 44:33.270
Why did I have to run into him
while I was on duty and get suspended?

44:36.550 --> 44:39.060
If you're going to cry,
then go home and do it.

44:54.820 --> 44:56.859
Where are we going?

44:56.860 --> 44:59.310
At least let me know where we're going.

44:59.640 --> 45:01.240
Lee Yoon Sung.

45:02.140 --> 45:03.119
Get in.

45:03.120 --> 45:03.919
No.

45:03.920 --> 45:06.130
Stop being stubborn and get in.

45:08.710 --> 45:10.179
Why are you doing this?

45:10.180 --> 45:12.030
Because I'm the worst.
So what?

45:29.900 --> 45:32.009
Where are we going right now?

45:32.010 --> 45:33.970
I'm trying to make you feel better.

45:39.470 --> 45:40.610
What?

45:41.490 --> 45:42.940
Why are you looking at me like that?

45:43.370 --> 45:45.690
Why are you so nice to me?

45:46.260 --> 45:48.489
Because we live under the same roof
together, like family.

45:48.490 --> 45:51.100
You were like this
even before we lived together.

45:52.010 --> 45:57.110
You talk ruthlessly and act mean,
but you paid my dad's hospital fees,

45:58.050 --> 46:01.270
bought the house from auction
and let me live in the house for free...

46:01.820 --> 46:02.819
When I got that injury on my face,

46:02.820 --> 46:07.320
you put a bandage on for me and took me
to the hospital when I sprained my ankle...

46:08.360 --> 46:11.400
And now you're taking me
on a drive like this...

46:12.630 --> 46:14.599
I'm sitting right next to you,
you're embarrassing me.

46:14.600 --> 46:15.332
Ah, forget that.

46:15.333 --> 46:18.442
From now on, whatever you do,
I'll keep your secret.

46:18.480 --> 46:22.670
You can cry, yell, and smash things.
You can do whatever you want.

46:25.260 --> 46:27.183
Choi Da Hye, you fool!

46:27.184 --> 46:30.517
You're a rotten student
and you go and fight! Geez...

46:30.540 --> 46:32.929
You* have no one to call? (*people using
phones to take videos instead of calling)

46:32.930 --> 46:37.850
Chief, you're such a jerk!

46:38.420 --> 46:42.030
Saying bad things about me is enough,
why are you bashing my dad too?

46:42.600 --> 46:46.419
And Shin Eun Ah, if you get diarrhea again
from eating greedily,

46:46.420 --> 46:48.049
I'm going to kill you!

46:48.050 --> 46:53.339
And Lee Yoon Sung, the way you look and act
makes you a total unlucky jerk!

46:53.340 --> 46:56.439
Hey, Kim Na Na.
Just because you're good at judo...

46:56.440 --> 46:57.979
are you going to go around
doing whatever you want?

46:57.980 --> 47:01.420
You can't even fight, and you wave
your gun around, you're just all guts.

47:05.390 --> 47:07.030
Do you feel better?

47:26.220 --> 47:28.040
It's refreshing.

47:28.090 --> 47:30.960
I finally feel revitalized.

47:32.180 --> 47:36.420
Do I really look and act
like an unlucky jerk?

47:37.680 --> 47:40.419
There are lots of girls
willing to walk through fire for me.

47:40.420 --> 47:43.880
They're all in line at the Jamsil Stadium
with a waiting number.

47:43.980 --> 47:47.190
You're definitely
the King of All Unlucky Jerks.

47:47.270 --> 47:48.500
Hey.

47:50.880 --> 47:52.840
Oh... it's raining.

47:53.970 --> 47:54.879
Oh, it really is.

47:54.880 --> 47:56.009
It's cold.

47:56.010 --> 47:57.399
It's fine.
I can just close the roof.

48:02.400 --> 48:03.999
Oh, why isn't this working?

48:04.000 --> 48:05.639
Do something, it's cold.

48:05.640 --> 48:07.780
- What's wrong with this?
- It's cold!

48:08.380 --> 48:10.960
- Hurry, let's go! It's cold.
- Why is...?

48:11.030 --> 48:13.240
Is it broken?

48:16.990 --> 48:18.589
- It's cold.
- Calm down for a second.

48:18.590 --> 48:22.250
We came to drink coffee and this happens...

48:25.718 --> 48:26.947
Wait.

48:27.720 --> 48:29.740
Let's go to my house.

48:29.860 --> 48:31.789
How can we go all the way there
in this rain?

48:31.790 --> 48:33.400
This is closer.

48:54.260 --> 48:55.780
Hey, cover up.

48:58.590 --> 49:02.020
My eyes are damaged because of you.
Your figure is awful.

49:06.250 --> 49:07.870
Did he see everything?

49:18.040 --> 49:19.779
Wash over there and change.

49:19.780 --> 49:21.580
I'll come down after washing up too.

49:22.190 --> 49:23.600
Thank you.

50:16.090 --> 50:17.720
Kim Na Na.

50:18.330 --> 50:19.640
Kim Na...

50:33.860 --> 50:37.670
Lee Yoon Sung,
the stove won't listen to me.

50:41.440 --> 50:44.960
You don't need to do that.
I'll do it.

50:48.960 --> 50:51.600
Just turn it on, I'll make ramen.

50:51.660 --> 50:52.770
Yeah.

50:52.940 --> 50:54.479
I pressed it.

50:54.480 --> 50:55.940
I'll take a look at it.

50:58.370 --> 51:00.380
Then I'll get the dishes.

51:10.330 --> 51:12.200
Why is it so high...?

51:26.900 --> 51:30.130
You eat by yourself.
I'm not eating.

51:33.510 --> 51:35.370
Let's eat together.

54:28.650 --> 54:30.100
[Father]

54:40.440 --> 54:41.859
Yes, Father.

54:41.860 --> 54:45.080
It's tomorrow.
Can you do it?

54:45.240 --> 54:48.269
Yes.
You don't have to worry.

54:48.270 --> 54:52.040
This is your last opportunity,
you can't miss the chance to get him again.

54:52.190 --> 54:54.119
- Yes.
- I'm going to help too.

54:54.120 --> 54:58.860
Once you get Seo Yong Hak, let's meet at the
jewelry warehouse we agreed on last time.

54:59.310 --> 55:00.360
Yes.

55:05.920 --> 55:07.110
Sleep.

55:47.680 --> 55:50.360
The radio frequency
of Seo Yong Hak's bodyguards...

56:16.870 --> 56:19.340
Thank you for yesterday.

56:19.730 --> 56:23.120
Thanks to you, my rotten mood is gone.

56:23.780 --> 56:26.590
Just because I told you to,
you just badmouthed me to my face.

56:27.260 --> 56:31.190
What about you?
What? I'm just all guts?

56:33.030 --> 56:35.329
Go in.
I'll be home late today.

56:35.330 --> 56:36.550
Hey...

56:39.550 --> 56:40.600
What?

56:41.350 --> 56:46.950
Should I make something?
Tell me what you like.

56:51.460 --> 56:57.460
Japchae* with a lot of meat but
no carrots and onion... (*clear noodle dish)

57:08.950 --> 57:10.560
That meat-eater...

57:13.070 --> 57:16.590
Oh... Where did my earring go?

57:21.970 --> 57:23.320
Hello?

57:23.750 --> 57:24.809
Yes, Chief.

57:24.810 --> 57:26.960
Candidate Seo Yong Hak has given orders.

57:27.040 --> 57:30.899
He said that every time something happened,
he survived because of you, Kim Na Na.

57:30.900 --> 57:32.980
He said he's not comfortable
without you there.

57:33.370 --> 57:35.540
<i>The higher ups approved too.</i>

57:35.860 --> 57:40.559
I'll revoke the suspension,
so stay focused and do well.

57:40.560 --> 57:44.490
Really?
Thank you. Thank you, Chief.

58:21.250 --> 58:23.569
All right, let's do well today.

58:23.570 --> 58:24.590
Yes.

58:26.370 --> 58:28.179
- Representative Lee, you're here too.
- Let's do well today.

58:28.180 --> 58:29.560
Let's do well.

58:31.290 --> 58:32.739
You're all here early today.

58:32.740 --> 58:33.940
Yes.

58:37.260 --> 58:39.260
Okay, great job.

58:58.600 --> 58:59.999
- Is the tape ready to roll?
- Yes, it is.

59:00.000 --> 59:01.019
- Is the audio ready?
- Yes, it is.

59:01.020 --> 59:02.409
- What about the lighting?
- Yes, it's good.

59:02.410 --> 59:05.610
We're on.
Ready... cue!

59:07.901 --> 59:13.051
[Presidential Candidate Debate]

59:22.130 --> 59:27.830
First we heard from Presidential Candidate
Lee Jin Hoo from the Advanced Korea Party.

59:27.930 --> 59:30.249
We appreciate hearing of your intentions
to focus on the redistribution of wealth

59:30.250 --> 59:34.519
to combat the current trend towards
polarization because of wealth disparity.

59:34.520 --> 59:39.900
Second, let's hear from Candidate
Seo Yong Hak from the New People's Party.

59:43.770 --> 59:47.309
Hello, I'm Seo Yong Hak.

59:47.310 --> 59:50.879
I've worked for the military government
for 40 years...

59:50.880 --> 59:53.169
and I'm sure there are a lot of people
who were surprised...

59:53.170 --> 59:55.969
that I'm running for president.

59:55.970 --> 01:00:01.700
Some people will be worried
that the military is taking over.

01:00:01.750 --> 01:00:06.029
<i>The reason I'm running for president,</i>

01:00:06.030 --> 01:00:09.916
<i>The national defense and safety
of our Republic of S. Korea...</i>

01:00:09.917 --> 01:00:11.910
<i>How far has it actually come?</i>

01:00:11.945 --> 01:00:15.899
You'll understand
after watching the clip I have prepared.

01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:18.750
<i>Now, let's watch.</i>

01:00:19.890 --> 01:00:23.710
<i>I will report that this deal
has completely fallen through.</i>

01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:27.129
What's the rush?
Sit down, sit down.

01:00:27.130 --> 01:00:29.260
<i>Can't we just import them?</i>

01:00:29.350 --> 01:00:30.994
<i>But I have a condition.</i>

01:00:30.995 --> 01:00:34.699
<i>In this transaction, as a handling fee,</i>

01:00:34.734 --> 01:00:37.025
<i>I want 20 percent of the profits.</i>

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:38.649
<i>20 percent?</i>

01:00:38.650 --> 01:00:40.650
<i>We've never paid such a steep...</i>

01:00:40.690 --> 01:00:43.619
Hey, turn it off. Turn it off immediately.
Turn it off immediately.

01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:45.139
This is a plot against my candidacy.

01:00:45.140 --> 01:00:46.819
Candidate Seo Yong Hak, what is that?

01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:48.919
Look here, I'm being framed.

01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:51.079
It's a political attack to bring me down,
Everyone.

01:00:51.512 --> 01:00:53.120
What kind of conspiracy is this?!

01:00:54.580 --> 01:00:56.610
Get the car ready, hurry!

01:00:59.950 --> 01:01:03.919
You follow candidate Seo Yong Hak.
The City Hunter might be upstairs.

01:01:06.655 --> 01:01:08.159
Really, what the heck is this?

01:02:25.930 --> 01:02:28.649
Yes, I'm taking the candidate
to the parking lot right now.

01:02:28.650 --> 01:02:30.370
Please have the car on standby.

01:02:31.930 --> 01:02:37.141
Sir, wouldn't it be better to be direct
and say it was a fabrication?

01:02:37.830 --> 01:02:39.740
Hey, that man...!

01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:41.780
Who are you?

01:02:51.340 --> 01:02:53.540
Na Na, grab Seo Yong Hak.

01:02:57.840 --> 01:02:59.290
Don't come any closer.

01:03:08.090 --> 01:03:10.400
I said don't come any closer!

01:03:15.670 --> 01:03:18.869
S... Sir, calm down.
I'll protect you...

01:03:18.870 --> 01:03:22.240
Shut up!
I told you not to provoke me.
