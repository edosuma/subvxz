WEBVTT

00:01.251 --> 00:03.295
Previously on...

00:03.337 --> 00:05.297
They paid us to
hang out with them?

00:05.339 --> 00:07.257
Bree, we are like
prostitutes.

00:07.299 --> 00:08.759
No, we're not prostitutes.

00:08.801 --> 00:09.718
We're escorts.

00:11.303 --> 00:12.847
You are a reminder of
what happened this summer,

00:12.888 --> 00:14.139
but not just
the accident.

00:14.181 --> 00:16.433
I was supposed to be
comforting my friend's wife.

00:16.475 --> 00:17.768
And instead,
I started falling for her.

00:19.979 --> 00:21.647
You're running a car theft ring
out of my stage?

00:21.689 --> 00:23.565
No, we're running a car theft
ring out of your stage.

00:23.607 --> 00:25.275
For you.

00:25.317 --> 00:26.276
I'm not taking your dirty money.

00:26.318 --> 00:27.402
It's already yours.

00:28.821 --> 00:31.615
You are the single most
annoying man

00:31.657 --> 00:33.116
on the entire planet.

00:33.158 --> 00:35.160
Well, you're no peach
yourself there, sweetheart.

00:37.329 --> 00:39.414
What happened to MIT?
I decided to stay
closer to home

00:39.456 --> 00:40.749
and to you.

00:40.791 --> 00:41.709
You haven't met anyone else?

00:41.750 --> 00:43.544
No, I haven't.

00:43.585 --> 00:45.212
Max might see the good in you,

00:45.253 --> 00:46.129
but I see the bad,

00:46.171 --> 00:47.589
and I like it.

00:47.631 --> 00:48.590
NAOMI:
I've been that person before.

00:48.632 --> 00:49.967
I'm not gonna
do this again.

00:50.009 --> 00:52.386
ADRIANNA:
I met a guy
on the pier yesterday.

00:52.427 --> 00:53.470
You're Jane's husband.

00:53.512 --> 00:56.223
Jim? You're dead.

00:56.264 --> 00:57.641
Don't tell them.

01:03.731 --> 01:05.649
So, why didn't you
just tell Jane and Liam

01:05.691 --> 01:07.735
you're still alive?

01:07.776 --> 01:08.736
How could I?

01:08.777 --> 01:09.987
What do I do?

01:10.029 --> 01:13.032
Just walk in and go,
"Hey, guess what?"

01:13.073 --> 01:15.200
Well, I don't know,
not like that.

01:15.242 --> 01:18.037
But spying on me,
sneaking around,

01:18.078 --> 01:19.830
asking me all kinds
of weird questions.

01:19.872 --> 01:21.999
I needed to know
what was going on.

01:22.041 --> 01:24.835
When I was lost at sea,

01:24.877 --> 01:26.962
I was so out of it
when they found me

01:27.004 --> 01:28.881
that I couldn't even
remember my own name.

01:30.465 --> 01:33.260
Did Jane even look for me?

01:33.301 --> 01:36.055
She said there were
search parties.

01:36.095 --> 01:37.514
She was heartbroken.

01:37.556 --> 01:38.432
I saw them.

01:39.975 --> 01:41.268
They're living together.

01:43.604 --> 01:46.231
Are they in love
with one another?

01:46.273 --> 01:49.693
Just please...
tell me the truth.

01:49.735 --> 01:52.696
They're...

01:52.738 --> 01:54.364
Yes.

01:54.406 --> 01:56.867
They're together,
and they're happy.

01:56.909 --> 01:59.453
Okay.

01:59.494 --> 02:02.205
I'll, um... I'll go.

02:02.247 --> 02:04.750
Well, I obviously have to
tell them that I saw you.

02:04.792 --> 02:06.001
Please don't.

02:06.043 --> 02:07.836
It's probably best
that I just stay dead.

02:14.259 --> 02:15.469
(sighs)

02:15.510 --> 02:17.596
Now I have you where I want you.

02:19.180 --> 02:20.724
(shrieks)

02:20.766 --> 02:23.727
(laughs)

02:23.769 --> 02:25.646
(moaning)

02:28.440 --> 02:29.817
MAX:
Naomi?

02:29.858 --> 02:32.444
You okay?

02:32.486 --> 02:35.906
That must have
been some dream.

02:35.948 --> 02:37.741
You were tossing
around so much,

02:37.783 --> 02:39.409
you almost knocked
me out of bed.

02:39.451 --> 02:41.328
Max, I'm so glad
you're here.

02:41.369 --> 02:43.497
Show me the nightmare.

02:43.538 --> 02:45.457
I will obliterate it.

02:45.499 --> 02:46.667
(chuckles)

02:46.708 --> 02:49.086
Like this.

02:49.128 --> 02:50.129
And this.

02:50.169 --> 02:52.255
(laughs)

02:52.297 --> 02:53.799
Ooh. Oh, yeah.

02:53.841 --> 02:55.216
(laughs)

02:55.258 --> 02:57.427
I'm picking up Teddy from
the airport in an hour.

02:57.469 --> 02:58.762
Oh, and tomorrow,

02:58.804 --> 03:00.430
I have a meeting
with that guy.

03:00.472 --> 03:01.765
What guy?

03:01.807 --> 03:04.225
Uh, a student activist
named Shane something.

03:04.267 --> 03:06.103
He saw the commercial
that I did for Liam

03:06.145 --> 03:07.604
and he asked if I'd help him

03:07.646 --> 03:09.314
on a political project.
What?

03:09.356 --> 03:10.983
He's running for student
council president?

03:11.025 --> 03:13.068
Mm, probably something like
that. What are you doing today?

03:13.110 --> 03:15.070
Booked all day.
Haven't got a free minute.

03:15.112 --> 03:18.115
"Leila, what are you
doing today?"

03:18.157 --> 03:19.616
I'm so glad you asked.

03:19.658 --> 03:22.327
I'm going to school,
and then I'm coming back here,

03:22.369 --> 03:23.620
and then I'm going
to school...

03:23.662 --> 03:24.872
And you're coming
back here.

03:24.913 --> 03:26.205
Yeah, it's called
being grounded.

03:26.247 --> 03:27.582
After the ransom stunt
you pulled,

03:27.624 --> 03:29.001
(chuckles)
get used to it.

03:29.043 --> 03:30.335
You're the worst brother
who ever lived.

03:30.377 --> 03:31.461
Worse than Mom and Dad.

03:31.503 --> 03:34.089
But way better
than a nice,

03:34.131 --> 03:35.799
strict Swiss
boarding school.

03:35.841 --> 03:36.842
Shut up.

03:36.884 --> 03:38.010
Can I say,
"You shut up"?

03:38.052 --> 03:39.011
Please...

03:39.053 --> 03:40.888
I hate you both.

03:44.349 --> 03:46.309
(door slams)

03:46.351 --> 03:48.311
(sighs)

03:48.353 --> 03:50.397
She's gone.

03:50.438 --> 03:52.273
(chuckles)

03:53.984 --> 03:55.736
Hi.
(laughs)
Hello.

03:58.030 --> 03:59.907
(phone ringing)

04:02.868 --> 04:03.827
Oh, no.

04:03.869 --> 04:04.953
Oh, it's Teddy.

04:04.995 --> 04:05.954
What?

04:05.996 --> 04:07.330
(groans)

04:07.372 --> 04:08.707
It's Teddy?
Mm-hmm.

04:08.749 --> 04:10.000
Hold on.
(muffled):
Where you going?

04:10.042 --> 04:11.168
Wait.
What are you doing?

04:12.836 --> 04:14.588
Hello.

04:14.629 --> 04:16.923
What?

04:16.964 --> 04:21.386
No, great. Uh, just-just
get your baggage and I'll...

04:21.428 --> 04:22.846
Yep, I'm on my way.

04:22.888 --> 04:24.389
Okay. Can't wait to see you.

04:24.431 --> 04:26.474
Bye.

04:26.516 --> 04:27.642
(sighs)

04:27.684 --> 04:29.603
His plane landed early.

04:29.644 --> 04:30.979
(groans)

04:31.021 --> 04:32.689
Can't we assume
that he lost his luggage?

04:32.731 --> 04:33.982
Mm-mm.
It'll take time.

04:34.024 --> 04:35.442
He's only got carry-on.

04:35.483 --> 04:36.443
(sobs)

04:38.403 --> 04:39.738
(sighs)

04:39.780 --> 04:41.656
Okay.

04:44.159 --> 04:45.577
(muffled shouting)

04:45.619 --> 04:47.121
Listen, great song, great song.

04:47.162 --> 04:48.122
Thank you.

04:48.163 --> 04:50.457
Hey, would you like-- No? No?

04:50.498 --> 04:51.458
Would-- What about you?

04:51.499 --> 04:52.500
You want-- No?

04:52.542 --> 04:53.794
Okay.

04:53.835 --> 04:55.754
Hey, great song.
You'll love it.

04:55.796 --> 04:57.631
Fellas, fellas.

04:57.672 --> 04:58.632
No?

04:58.673 --> 04:59.925
Ladies, come on, please?

04:59.967 --> 05:03.678
No? No? No?

05:03.720 --> 05:05.222
Damn!

05:05.264 --> 05:06.514
These people are cold.

05:06.556 --> 05:08.225
You want one, right?
And what is it?

05:08.267 --> 05:10.185
It's me.
It's my best track yet.

05:10.227 --> 05:12.187
It's gonna blow your mind
how good it sounds.

05:12.229 --> 05:13.939
Somebody's got to put it

05:13.981 --> 05:15.690
on Twitter or Facebook
or something.

05:15.732 --> 05:17.567
I just need
a little bit of buzz.

05:17.609 --> 05:19.611
Is this coffee?

05:19.653 --> 05:20.612
Uh, you're welcome.

05:20.654 --> 05:21.905
You sure you
need that?

05:21.947 --> 05:23.323
You're going a
mile a minute.
Mm-hmm.

05:23.364 --> 05:24.324
Been up all night.

05:24.365 --> 05:25.575
I'm, like, running on fumes.

05:25.617 --> 05:26.660
(chuckles)

05:26.701 --> 05:28.245
Oh, yeah, um,
your lawyer hit me up.

05:28.287 --> 05:29.871
Asked me to write you
a character reference.

05:29.913 --> 05:32.415
And I told him
that you party all the time.

05:32.457 --> 05:33.792
(laughs)

05:33.834 --> 05:35.585
Dixon, that's not
even funny, okay?

05:35.627 --> 05:38.630
My lawyer is trying to gather
all of the ammunition he can

05:38.672 --> 05:41.549
to stop Marla's relatives
from blocking my inheritance.

05:41.591 --> 05:43.260
And what's gonna happen
if I don't get it?

05:43.302 --> 05:45.595
I already lost the
Kappa scholarship, too.

05:45.637 --> 05:47.264
I might have to
drop out of school.

05:47.306 --> 05:48.389
No, no, no.

05:48.431 --> 05:49.432
You're good
at thinking stuff up.

05:49.474 --> 05:50.642
I mean,
you'll land on your feet.

05:50.684 --> 05:51.893
Plus, your lawyer
has it under control, right?

05:53.312 --> 05:56.648
Oh. You think
he'd want to hear one?

06:02.154 --> 06:04.281
No, I'm good.

06:05.406 --> 06:06.992
How long do we have to sit here?

06:07.034 --> 06:09.828
I think we need to make a decent
dent in the pile of forms.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.791
Done.

06:14.833 --> 06:16.293
Hey, ladies.

06:16.335 --> 06:17.669
Having fun?
Yes.

06:17.711 --> 06:19.004
Oh, tons.

06:19.046 --> 06:20.964
Not anymore.
I can fix that.

06:21.006 --> 06:23.633
If you want to get out of here
and go to Big Bear, I know a guy

06:23.675 --> 06:25.468
with a ski house.
That might be tempting

06:25.510 --> 06:28.555
if it were actually winter
and we could actually ski.

06:28.596 --> 06:30.807
Well, actually, I, uh, wasn't
planning on skiing.

06:30.849 --> 06:32.559
Sorry, I have a boyfriend.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.353
And much more important things
to do than

06:34.393 --> 06:37.898
to fool around in a ski house
with a rodeo clown like you.

06:37.939 --> 06:39.482
Really? You're doing
more important things?

06:39.524 --> 06:40.859
What exactly are you doing?

06:40.901 --> 06:44.321
Giving away these.

06:44.363 --> 06:45.864
Voter
registration forms.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.199
(quietly):
Oh, my God, really?

06:47.241 --> 06:48.742
Yeah.

06:48.783 --> 06:51.161
Have fun not skiing
at your ski house, Austin.

06:51.203 --> 06:53.038
I will, and, you know,
so would you.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.122
See you, ladies.

06:56.291 --> 06:58.168
I would go to that ski house.

06:58.210 --> 07:00.962
And you would regret it.

07:01.004 --> 07:03.631
Giving up something real
and wholesome,

07:03.673 --> 07:05.175
that makes you feel like
a better person,

07:05.217 --> 07:08.303
for 48 hours
of hot sex.

07:08.345 --> 07:09.971
Shame on you,
Margene.

07:10.013 --> 07:11.973
MAX:
Hey.

07:12.015 --> 07:14.559
Oh, hi.

07:14.601 --> 07:17.396
Oh, voter registration.

07:17.437 --> 07:18.605
That's fun.

07:18.646 --> 07:19.689
It's not.

07:19.731 --> 07:20.982
That's the problem. All right?

07:21.024 --> 07:22.734
We're going about this
the complete wrong way.

07:22.776 --> 07:25.695
Nothing that involves
poster board and Sharpies

07:25.737 --> 07:27.197
is ever gonna get
anyone stimulated.

07:27.239 --> 07:29.199
We just want them
to register to vote.

07:29.241 --> 07:31.368
Nobody is going to do
the right thing

07:31.410 --> 07:34.579
when they can be doing
the fun thing.

07:34.621 --> 07:36.873
So we have to make
the right thing fun.

07:38.625 --> 07:41.711
I'm gonna put new meaning behind
the words "political party."

07:41.753 --> 07:43.380
(chuckles)

07:45.548 --> 07:47.550
I don't know why I ever
leave this place.

07:47.592 --> 07:48.551
(scoffs)

07:48.593 --> 07:49.594
You kidding me?

07:49.636 --> 07:51.471
You just got back
from the tennis tour

07:51.512 --> 07:53.556
to beat all tennis tours, man.

07:53.598 --> 07:55.850
Cannes, Sienna, Barcelona.

07:55.892 --> 07:58.519
Barcelona.

07:58.561 --> 08:00.688
Mmm.

08:00.730 --> 08:02.482
Is he...?

08:02.523 --> 08:03.775
Yes, I think he is.

08:03.817 --> 08:04.818
He is blushing.
Ah...

08:04.859 --> 08:06.027
All right, now,
who's the guy?

08:06.069 --> 08:10.365
He was a great guy,
but, you know, summer romance.

08:10.407 --> 08:12.117
He went his way, I went mine.

08:12.159 --> 08:13.243
Mm.

08:13.285 --> 08:15.870
Hey, how are you
and Navid doing?

08:15.912 --> 08:18.873
Well, um, it's
not exactly easy

08:18.915 --> 08:21.460
having his sister
live with us.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.086
Actually, something's
been bothering him

08:23.128 --> 08:25.380
and he just won't
talk to me about it.

08:25.422 --> 08:27.882
I think it has
to do with money.

08:27.924 --> 08:31.094
Well, maybe it's just
hard for him to talk about.

08:31.136 --> 08:32.679
Like your dad?

08:34.806 --> 08:36.933
You did tell
him, didn't you?

08:39.102 --> 08:42.397
I, uh, I left him a message,
told him I was gay.

08:42.438 --> 08:44.607
And he never even
called me back.

08:44.649 --> 08:49.112
Uh, maybe... maybe he
didn't get the message.

08:49.154 --> 08:52.115
Or the other two?

08:52.157 --> 08:54.201
At least my aunt and uncle
are trying to understand.

08:54.242 --> 08:56.495
They actually invited me over
as soon as I got back.

08:56.536 --> 08:57.912
Wait, really?

08:57.954 --> 08:59.414
Mm-hmm.

08:59.456 --> 09:03.126
I thought your Uncle Charles
was uberconservative.

09:03.168 --> 09:04.711
I know.

09:04.752 --> 09:06.587
You think they're just
trying to be polite?

09:06.629 --> 09:08.798
Well, at this point,
with my family,

09:08.840 --> 09:10.550
polite sounds
pretty damn good.

09:10.591 --> 09:12.844
Yeah.

09:12.886 --> 09:13.845
Yeah.

09:13.887 --> 09:15.638
JANE:
It was busy last night.

09:15.680 --> 09:17.391
People are still talking about
that commercial

09:17.432 --> 09:18.475
Silver made.

09:18.517 --> 09:20.352
Hey, give some props
to the cast.

09:20.394 --> 09:25.273
Uh, Academy Award for best
wet, shirtless performance?

09:25.315 --> 09:26.983
(laughs)
Don't laugh.

09:27.025 --> 09:29.569
I can finally afford to fix
that leak in the stockroom.

09:32.655 --> 09:33.948
I'm really into this.

09:33.990 --> 09:36.034
It's like I was made for it,
you know?

09:36.076 --> 09:37.827
You sure you're good with this?

09:39.204 --> 09:40.330
Me?

09:40.372 --> 09:41.415
The baby?

09:45.293 --> 09:46.669
I'm more than good.

09:48.088 --> 09:50.090
I finally feel like
my life makes sense.

09:55.387 --> 09:57.431
JANE: Jim?
LIAM:
You're alive.

10:17.867 --> 10:20.954
JIM: The cable broke loose
and whipped me into the water.

10:20.995 --> 10:22.497
I can't believe
you're alive.

10:22.539 --> 10:23.790
We searched for hours.

10:23.831 --> 10:25.833
We sent out planes the next day
and the day after that.

10:25.875 --> 10:28.462
Big ocean. You fall in at
night, you're a dead man.

10:28.503 --> 10:30.547
You know that
should have been me, right?

10:30.589 --> 10:31.923
If I hadn't have gotten sick,

10:31.965 --> 10:33.467
if you hadn't have
covered for me...

10:33.508 --> 10:36.010
You wouldn't have been there
to take care of Jane, right?

10:36.052 --> 10:37.637
JANE: You must have
been so afraid.

10:37.678 --> 10:39.847
Afraid that I'd
never see you again.

10:39.889 --> 10:41.391
Of how worried
you'd be.

10:41.433 --> 10:43.893
That you'd be
so lonely.

10:43.935 --> 10:45.395
Cabin cruiser
picked me up.

10:45.437 --> 10:46.687
I grabbed onto
a piece of wood,

10:46.729 --> 10:48.607
and I don't know how
long I was in there,

10:48.648 --> 10:50.317
but I was unconscious
when they found me.

10:50.358 --> 10:52.235
Took a few weeks to
remember everything,

10:52.277 --> 10:54.654
and then I thought of you,

10:54.695 --> 10:57.491
and it all came back.

10:57.532 --> 11:01.035
Minute I got into town,
I came right over,

11:01.077 --> 11:04.414
and now here we all are.

11:12.922 --> 11:14.882
So I got

11:14.924 --> 11:16.884
a hotel just outside
Santa Monica.

11:16.926 --> 11:18.845
I thought Janie
and I would...
Oh.
Yeah.

11:18.886 --> 11:20.514
Yeah, go, it's
stupid of me to...
Of course, that's great.

11:20.555 --> 11:23.850
Good, great,
I'm gonna go grab my coat.

11:25.726 --> 11:28.021
What are we gonna do?

11:28.062 --> 11:29.147
I can't tell him.

11:30.273 --> 11:32.233
We have to.

11:32.275 --> 11:35.153
No, please, I can't
tell him, not now.

11:35.195 --> 11:36.737
Thanks again,
buddy.

11:36.779 --> 11:38.657
I owe you one.

11:50.043 --> 11:52.753
15 feet, nine inches.

11:52.795 --> 11:54.755
Oh, Ivy,

11:54.797 --> 11:55.965
I need your help
with something.

11:56.007 --> 11:57.384
Nope.

11:57.425 --> 11:59.427
Come on, you like helping
the world and all that.

11:59.469 --> 12:01.638
I want you to do a
photo booth at my party.

12:01.680 --> 12:03.848
"Your head on the shoulders
of a great American."

12:03.890 --> 12:04.849
Help the democratic process.

12:04.891 --> 12:06.851
Be fun, right?

12:06.893 --> 12:09.646
Actually, yeah, that sounds
dope and so not like you.

12:09.688 --> 12:11.939
Come on, since when did you
start caring about the world?

12:11.981 --> 12:14.150
Oh, I accidentally
watched a documentary.

12:14.192 --> 12:15.151
Hmm.

12:15.193 --> 12:16.319
It moved me.

12:16.361 --> 12:17.612
Sure, count me in.

12:17.654 --> 12:19.780
I'm always down to support
the democratic process.

12:19.822 --> 12:20.781
Fabulous.

12:20.823 --> 12:22.367
(laughs)
Hey.

12:22.409 --> 12:24.494
Max, I'm so glad
you're here.

12:24.536 --> 12:25.953
(both sigh)

12:25.995 --> 12:26.954
Okay.

12:26.996 --> 12:28.289
Are you okay?

12:28.331 --> 12:30.458
Yeah, I've never
been better.

12:30.500 --> 12:31.710
(laughs)

12:31.750 --> 12:33.628
Uh, you told me to round
up some volunteers.

12:33.670 --> 12:34.629
Uh, Naomi,

12:34.671 --> 12:37.090
this is Austin.

12:37.131 --> 12:39.008
Yes, I know.

12:39.050 --> 12:40.427
I mean, we've met.

12:40.468 --> 12:42.303
We've, we've definitely met.

12:42.345 --> 12:44.972
Oh, anyway, um,
amazing thing--

12:45.014 --> 12:46.516
Austin heard about
our vote party

12:46.558 --> 12:48.309
and he has some
great ideas.

12:48.351 --> 12:49.603
Really?
Mm-hmm.

12:49.644 --> 12:51.605
And what might those be?

12:51.646 --> 12:52.606
Go ahead.

12:52.647 --> 12:53.814
How's this?

12:53.856 --> 12:56.276
Strip registration.

12:56.317 --> 12:58.819
So you get some gorgeous girls
and you set them up

12:58.861 --> 13:00.863
at tables with
registration cards,

13:00.905 --> 13:03.157
and, you know, they're wearing
a lot of layers of clothing...

13:03.199 --> 13:05.034
Well, not too many layers.

13:05.076 --> 13:07.579
But for every-- let's say--
ten voters who sign up,

13:07.621 --> 13:09.706
they take off
a piece of clothing.

13:09.748 --> 13:10.873
(laughs)

13:10.915 --> 13:13.000
I mean, everyone's
going to sign up.

13:13.042 --> 13:14.001
Some twice.

13:14.043 --> 13:15.002
Well,

13:15.044 --> 13:17.672
that is a lovely idea, Austin,

13:17.714 --> 13:20.216
but I'm pretty sure
we don't need your help.

13:20.258 --> 13:21.635
I think you do need me.

13:21.676 --> 13:23.470
He said he could
get us a band.

13:23.511 --> 13:24.845
Yeah, my
father knows

13:24.887 --> 13:26.431
some people
in the music business, so...

13:26.473 --> 13:28.891
(laughs)

13:28.933 --> 13:31.686
I bet his daddy can get us
a nice jug band.
(laughter)

13:31.728 --> 13:33.854
How about I just surprise you?

13:35.982 --> 13:38.234
TEDDY:
After the way things went
with Dad, I...

13:38.276 --> 13:40.194
really appreciate you inviting
me over, Uncle Charles.

13:40.236 --> 13:42.029
Of course,
Teddy.

13:42.071 --> 13:43.948
Your lifestyle choice
doesn't matter to me.

13:43.990 --> 13:45.241
Have a seat.

13:45.283 --> 13:46.785
It's not really
a choice.

13:46.825 --> 13:48.328
Figure of speech,
sorry.

13:48.369 --> 13:50.330
(chuckling)

13:50.371 --> 13:52.624
Can't keep up
with the right thing to say.

13:52.666 --> 13:54.250
Gay used to be a mood,
you know.

13:54.292 --> 13:55.669
(chuckles)

13:55.710 --> 13:57.796
What, what I'm trying
to say is,

13:57.836 --> 13:59.339
you have my support,
whatever you choose to do.

13:59.380 --> 14:01.840
I really appreciate that.

14:01.882 --> 14:06.095
Well... you know you've always
been a favorite of mine.

14:06.137 --> 14:08.389
I look at you, I still see
the same little boy

14:08.431 --> 14:09.848
who loved rolling
down the front lawn,

14:09.890 --> 14:12.560
but, uh, people change,

14:12.602 --> 14:14.646
times change.

14:14.688 --> 14:16.773
Maybe I should change, too,

14:16.815 --> 14:18.650
if I'm gonna be running
for congress.

14:18.692 --> 14:20.985
Congress?

14:21.027 --> 14:22.069
That's great.

14:22.111 --> 14:26.240
Mmm-- 57th District's wide open.

14:26.282 --> 14:27.742
It's going to be a fight.

14:27.784 --> 14:29.160
I'd like you to help me out.

14:29.202 --> 14:30.244
Maybe you'd consider
joining me

14:30.286 --> 14:32.664
at some
of the campaign events.

14:32.706 --> 14:36.042
I... I-I don't know,
I'm not really that political.

14:36.083 --> 14:37.377
Doesn't matter.

14:37.418 --> 14:38.545
Just be yourself

14:38.586 --> 14:40.547
and show
that you support me

14:40.588 --> 14:43.090
the way I support you.

14:43.132 --> 14:45.426
SILVER:
You want me

14:45.468 --> 14:49.639
to make campaign commercials
for a real congressional race?

14:49.681 --> 14:51.599
I, I don't even know
who's running yet.

14:51.641 --> 14:53.434
Most college students don't.

14:53.476 --> 14:55.562
Who's in congress decides
what happens in this country

14:55.603 --> 14:57.188
on every level.

14:57.230 --> 14:58.481
Marissa Harris-Young...

14:58.523 --> 15:00.483
Is that your candidate?
And yours,

15:00.525 --> 15:02.235
I hope.

15:02.276 --> 15:04.696
Okay, wait, I'm, I'm
talking too fast.

15:04.738 --> 15:07.532
Just, you know, I'm, I'm
excited, and her policies

15:07.574 --> 15:09.534
are great, but there's
more to her than that.

15:09.576 --> 15:10.951
You know, she
really believes

15:10.993 --> 15:13.120
that one person can
make a difference,

15:13.162 --> 15:15.623
like you did with
your commercial.

15:15.665 --> 15:16.957
Internet video.

15:16.999 --> 15:18.376
It was for my friend's bar.
Yeah,

15:18.418 --> 15:21.379
but it was funny and, and
you got people's attention.

15:21.421 --> 15:24.298
Marissa has got some
tough competition

15:24.340 --> 15:27.510
and we need young votes,
and you can do that.

15:27.552 --> 15:31.180
It's going to be a demanding
job, she'll need you 24-7,

15:31.222 --> 15:35.309
but you get full access to
Marissa, no strings attached.

15:35.351 --> 15:36.603
(laughs)

15:36.644 --> 15:38.438
I... wow.

15:38.479 --> 15:39.439
What can I say?

15:39.480 --> 15:40.732
Say yes.

15:40.774 --> 15:43.484
Well, yes, I'm...
I'm overwhelmed.

15:43.526 --> 15:44.819
Um, it's amazing, yes.

15:44.861 --> 15:47.196
Amazing, great.

15:47.238 --> 15:48.406
I was supposed to meet
my friend here.

15:48.448 --> 15:49.490
There he is.

15:49.532 --> 15:50.658
Teddy.
TEDDY:
Hey.

15:50.700 --> 15:52.326
SILVER:
It's going
to blow your mind.

15:52.368 --> 15:55.079
SHANE:
Teddy... I can't
believe this.

15:57.039 --> 15:59.500
I never thought
I'd see you again.

15:59.542 --> 16:00.585
Barcelona?

16:00.627 --> 16:03.337
Barcelona.
Barcelona.

16:03.379 --> 16:04.798
(chuckles)

16:04.839 --> 16:07.091
So what happened to Big Bear
and the ski lodge?

16:07.133 --> 16:08.342
Ah, well,
like you said,

16:08.384 --> 16:10.177
there's nothing more fun
than community service.

16:10.219 --> 16:12.012
Oh, please,
I'm not gonna stand here

16:12.054 --> 16:13.180
and pretend
to be impressed

16:13.222 --> 16:15.015
by your deep commitment
to voter registration.

16:15.057 --> 16:16.309
(chuckling):
Okay.

16:16.350 --> 16:18.144
Listen, you're not into
this any more than I am.

16:18.185 --> 16:20.521
Okay, you're just
trying to impress Mr.
Boy Scout in there.

16:20.563 --> 16:22.523
You don't know what I want.

16:22.565 --> 16:24.024
Hmm, but I know
what you need.

16:25.192 --> 16:28.112
Really?

16:28.154 --> 16:29.697
(chuckles)

16:29.739 --> 16:30.865
Then I guess

16:30.907 --> 16:35.202
you know I need
someone to, uh...

16:35.244 --> 16:36.370
move the outdoor furniture

16:36.412 --> 16:37.538
to make room
for the bandstand.

16:37.580 --> 16:39.165
Sound good, Austin?

16:39.206 --> 16:40.500
I'm gonna go find Max.

16:40.541 --> 16:42.168
(chuckling):
Okay.

16:44.879 --> 16:46.756
(both sigh)

16:49.049 --> 16:50.551
So, what are you
doing here?

16:50.593 --> 16:52.219
I thought you were going
back to D.C.

16:52.261 --> 16:53.721
No, I took
the year off,

16:53.763 --> 16:55.014
mostly to recover
from chasing you

16:55.055 --> 16:56.975
up all those steps
at the Gaudí church.

16:57.016 --> 16:58.935
Hey, you were the one
who insisted we make it

16:58.977 --> 17:00.603
to the top with a stomach
full of tapas.

17:00.645 --> 17:02.104
I had to impress you.

17:02.146 --> 17:03.648
You did.

17:03.690 --> 17:04.898
Good.

17:04.941 --> 17:06.776
Well, I hope this does, too.

17:06.818 --> 17:07.902
I'm working for
marriage equality.

17:07.944 --> 17:09.737
California is
a key state.

17:09.779 --> 17:13.406
Marissa Harris-Young is running
for congress, so I volunteered.

17:13.449 --> 17:15.326
You're working
for a congressional candidate?

17:15.367 --> 17:17.912
My uncle is running--
um, 57th District.

17:17.954 --> 17:19.873
The 57th?

17:19.914 --> 17:20.874
That's your uncle?

17:20.915 --> 17:21.958
He's running
against Marissa.

17:23.125 --> 17:25.336
Wow, must be tough for you.

17:25.377 --> 17:26.671
What do you mean?

17:26.713 --> 17:28.422
I mean, the guy is
a total homophobe.

17:28.464 --> 17:30.257
That's not
my opinion;

17:30.299 --> 17:32.092
check his record.

17:32.134 --> 17:33.928
I mean, everything he
believes and supports

17:33.970 --> 17:35.680
hurts people like us.

17:35.722 --> 17:38.683
Look, he thinks what he thinks,
but he's my uncle.

17:38.725 --> 17:41.019
Maybe he's open
to change.

17:41.060 --> 17:43.021
Maybe that's why he asked me
to help him on his campaign.

17:43.062 --> 17:44.022
You said no, right?

17:45.565 --> 17:46.566
Teddy, you're a gay man.

17:46.607 --> 17:48.026
The choices you make
have to make sense.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.486
This is
important.

17:50.528 --> 17:52.697
We could never be together if
you're going to work for him.

17:55.825 --> 17:58.327
BREE:
So the date's tonight.

17:58.369 --> 18:00.204
They are so nice.

18:00.246 --> 18:04.291
Investment bankers--
ginormous bonuses.

18:04.333 --> 18:05.459
I actually have
this thing

18:05.501 --> 18:07.294
that I have to do
at my friend Naomi's.

18:07.336 --> 18:08.922
Okay, so you can
either hang out

18:08.963 --> 18:11.883
with your friends for free
or hot guys for money.

18:11.925 --> 18:12.967
Choices.

18:13.009 --> 18:14.218
Look, if you don't
want to do it,

18:14.260 --> 18:15.302
I can totally find
somebody else.

18:15.344 --> 18:17.513
No, no, I do.

18:17.555 --> 18:18.556
I will do it.

18:18.598 --> 18:19.557
Yay.

18:19.599 --> 18:20.558
Okay, I got to go.

18:20.600 --> 18:23.227
Call me later.
Mm-hmm.

18:23.269 --> 18:25.312
Hey, Annie. Hey.
Oh.

18:25.354 --> 18:27.189
Hey.
Hey, guys, what's up?
SILVER:
Annie,

18:27.231 --> 18:29.025
our most responsible,
reliable friend.

18:29.067 --> 18:31.151
Uh, Silver here just got
the most amazing job, uh,

18:31.193 --> 18:32.570
that'll completely take up
what little time

18:32.612 --> 18:33.571
we have for each other,

18:33.613 --> 18:34.906
and so,

18:34.948 --> 18:36.574
uh, we need a babysitter.
For Leila.

18:36.616 --> 18:37.825
She is grounded
unless she is

18:37.867 --> 18:39.911
with someone
responsible, you know,

18:39.953 --> 18:42.455
in loco parentis, if you
would just be willing
to be driven loco

18:42.496 --> 18:43.706
for the evening.

18:43.748 --> 18:44.749
Okay.

18:44.791 --> 18:47.001
Oh, my God,
thank you.

18:47.043 --> 18:48.419
Thank you.
Thank you,
thank you.

18:48.461 --> 18:50.170
Pick her up
tonight.

18:50.212 --> 18:51.338
Tonight?

18:51.380 --> 18:54.759
Uh, oh, I'm, I'm,
I'm sorry, guys,

18:54.801 --> 18:57.177
I have dinner with Bree
and her friends from New York.

18:57.219 --> 18:58.304
So? You said
Bree's great.

18:58.345 --> 18:59.346
I'm sure her
friends are great.

18:59.388 --> 19:00.681
Just take Leila
with you.

19:00.723 --> 19:03.142
Guys, I'm, I'm really sorry,
but I can't.

19:03.183 --> 19:04.226
Why?
Why?

19:04.268 --> 19:05.853
I just really can't.

19:05.895 --> 19:07.105
NAVID:
No, Annie, you
don't understand.

19:07.146 --> 19:10.942
We really need some time
alone together, and...

19:10.984 --> 19:12.652
I will pay you
a thousand dollars.

19:12.693 --> 19:13.486
Really?

19:13.527 --> 19:14.779
No!

19:14.821 --> 19:18.116
Annie, I just really, really
need you to do this for me.

19:18.157 --> 19:19.241
(sighs)

19:19.283 --> 19:20.409
Please.
Okay.

19:20.451 --> 19:21.410
SILVER:
Awesome, great.

19:21.452 --> 19:23.496
Thank you,
thanks.

19:23.537 --> 19:25.039
Let's go.
You're a rock star.

19:25.081 --> 19:25.957
Okay.

19:30.377 --> 19:32.088
Hey, did something spill?

19:32.130 --> 19:34.173
Jim came back.

19:34.214 --> 19:35.466
He's alive.

19:35.508 --> 19:36.968
It's a miracle, right?

19:37.010 --> 19:38.302
Wait, Jim was here?

19:38.344 --> 19:39.553
He said he was leaving.

19:40.847 --> 19:42.807
What are you talking about?

19:42.849 --> 19:45.977
Okay, you know how I thought
that I had a stalker?

19:46.019 --> 19:47.603
Well, it wasn't.

19:47.645 --> 19:50.356
It was Jim and he had been
watching you and Jane.

19:50.397 --> 19:51.524
He said he could tell

19:51.565 --> 19:52.859
that there was something
between the two of you.

19:52.900 --> 19:54.735
But he, he acted
like he just got here.

19:54.777 --> 19:55.987
He said if you
were happy,

19:56.029 --> 19:58.072
he would just go away.

20:03.036 --> 20:04.871
Where's Jane?

20:04.912 --> 20:06.039
Jane?

20:06.080 --> 20:07.957
My wife?

20:09.249 --> 20:10.376
Are you all right?

20:10.417 --> 20:12.003
Liam, yeah, why?

20:12.045 --> 20:13.838
Jim talked to Adrianna,
he's been watching us

20:13.880 --> 20:15.464
for a week.

20:15.506 --> 20:16.674
Why didn't
you tell me?

20:16.716 --> 20:17.675
I'm your friend.

20:17.717 --> 20:18.676
Friend?

20:18.718 --> 20:19.844
You stole my wife.

20:19.886 --> 20:21.846
Why didn't you
say something?

20:21.888 --> 20:24.098
Because we didn't want
to hurt you.

20:25.058 --> 20:26.350
(grunts)
No, Jim!

20:26.392 --> 20:27.267
Liam, no.

20:28.268 --> 20:29.311
When did it
start, huh?

20:29.353 --> 20:30.563
Stop, stop! Get off him!
When did it start, huh,

20:30.604 --> 20:32.523
before I even fell
off the boat?!
Are you crazy?

20:35.275 --> 20:36.861
You idiot,
she's pregnant.

20:36.903 --> 20:38.779
What?

20:40.740 --> 20:42.282
All right, we're gonna
get you to a hospital.

20:49.123 --> 20:50.750
NAOMI:
All right.

20:50.791 --> 20:51.876
This way, ladies, okay,

20:51.918 --> 20:53.502
so, girls, it's going to go

20:53.544 --> 20:56.505
right directly
between the lanterns,

20:56.547 --> 20:59.926
a little to the left.

20:59.967 --> 21:02.511
Max, sweetheart, the
Washington Monument

21:02.553 --> 21:03.345
is in Sherman Oaks,
and I need...

21:03.387 --> 21:04.346
It's actually in Washington.

21:04.388 --> 21:05.514
No, it's a cake.

21:05.556 --> 21:06.766
I need somebody
to go pick up the...

21:06.807 --> 21:08.101
Oh.

21:08.142 --> 21:09.185
There's Austin.

21:09.227 --> 21:10.603
Could you be

21:10.644 --> 21:13.313
a dear and use that big,
practical, useful truck of yours

21:13.355 --> 21:14.815
to go pick up the cake?

21:14.857 --> 21:16.192
I'll pick up the cake.

21:16.234 --> 21:18.945
No, I need you here,
and I need him to be there.

21:18.986 --> 21:21.572
I should probably stay
with the band.
He's right.

21:21.614 --> 21:23.616
I'm sure Austin can help
with whatever you need here.

21:24.867 --> 21:26.994
(laughs)
Of course.

21:27.036 --> 21:29.038
Mmm.

21:29.080 --> 21:30.456
Mmm. Oh.

21:30.497 --> 21:31.540
Mmm.
Mmm.

21:32.499 --> 21:34.085
(laughing):
Mmm.
Mmm.

21:34.127 --> 21:35.795
(both moaning)

21:35.836 --> 21:37.213
Mmm.
(laughing)

21:37.255 --> 21:38.547
I'll hurry back.

21:38.589 --> 21:39.799
(laughs)

21:42.969 --> 21:45.221
Well, you heard the man.

21:45.263 --> 21:47.265
Just tell me what you need.

21:47.306 --> 21:49.183
Hmm.

21:52.311 --> 21:53.729
Hmm.

22:00.111 --> 22:02.029
How is she?

22:02.071 --> 22:04.740
She has a mild
concussion.

22:04.782 --> 22:08.368
They want her for a few more
hours just to-- I don't know--

22:08.410 --> 22:09.787
keep an eye on her.

22:09.829 --> 22:10.955
The baby?

22:10.997 --> 22:12.581
He said it's
fine in there.

22:12.623 --> 22:16.169
Nature protects the weak
from thoughtless jerks.

22:21.299 --> 22:22.925
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

22:22.967 --> 22:25.427
I'm... Yeah, you shouldn't be
the one to apologize.

22:25.469 --> 22:27.096
True.

22:27.138 --> 22:29.265
I mean, I shouldn't have even...

22:29.307 --> 22:31.058
No. You shouldn't have.

22:34.645 --> 22:37.273
But you did.

22:37.315 --> 22:39.275
In fairness to you, I was dead,

22:39.317 --> 22:40.567
so...

22:40.609 --> 22:42.069
Yeah, but still...
No. Liam,

22:42.111 --> 22:44.280
here's the thing.

22:44.322 --> 22:46.364
You knew she was my wife, yeah.

22:48.784 --> 22:51.578
But you also knew
that was my baby.

22:51.620 --> 22:54.456
(sighs)
And you were there
for both of them.

22:54.498 --> 22:56.458
You stepped up.

22:58.169 --> 23:00.171
Jane's a great girl.

23:00.213 --> 23:01.755
I know, right?

23:01.797 --> 23:02.965
(laughs)
Oh, she...

23:03.007 --> 23:04.091
I don't deserve her.

23:05.592 --> 23:07.636
If you think
that you're the one she wants,

23:07.678 --> 23:10.264
I...
No. I'm not.

23:11.932 --> 23:13.893
Jane came

23:13.934 --> 23:16.062
to me because
we were both grieving.

23:16.103 --> 23:19.357
Jim, she loves you.

23:19.439 --> 23:20.900
I'm glad she has you back.

23:22.568 --> 23:27.656
I'm glad I have you back.

23:27.698 --> 23:28.824
Come on, that's
my favorite.

23:28.866 --> 23:30.492
You don't like that
at all?
No.

23:30.534 --> 23:31.535
Is Jane gonna be okay?

23:31.577 --> 23:33.162
ADRIANNA:
Everything is fine.

23:33.204 --> 23:34.580
Don't worry.
I'll talk to you later.

23:34.621 --> 23:36.082
Dude, are
you serious?
Bye.

23:36.123 --> 23:39.001
Hey, guys.
Hey.

23:39.043 --> 23:40.169
Ooh, CDs.
Yup.

23:40.211 --> 23:41.795
Uh, Ivy's actually
shooting me a cover.

23:41.837 --> 23:44.257
She swears she got some crazy
good shots on the beach.

23:44.298 --> 23:46.217
Check it out.

23:46.259 --> 23:47.885
Are you...? Oh,
that is so good.

23:47.927 --> 23:51.555
Wow. These are really terrific.

23:51.597 --> 23:53.682
Ivy, you're really good at this.

23:53.724 --> 23:55.351
Thanks.
Yeah, she better be.

23:55.393 --> 23:56.685
I need to start
moving these things,

23:56.727 --> 23:58.104
or I'm gonna
have to tell Liam

23:58.145 --> 23:59.730
to start using
them as coasters.

23:59.772 --> 24:02.191
Well, sometimes it takes
a while to get attention.

24:02.233 --> 24:03.817
Which isn't the worst thing.

24:03.859 --> 24:05.819
Yeah, well, Cobra Starship is
playing at Naomi's tonight,

24:05.861 --> 24:07.529
so I have to go watch and see

24:07.571 --> 24:10.157
what I'm not gonna be doing
with the rest of my life.

24:10.199 --> 24:11.367
I know their manager.

24:11.409 --> 24:12.701
He's a nice guy.

24:12.743 --> 24:13.869
You know their manager?

24:13.911 --> 24:15.662
Can you get him my CD?

24:15.704 --> 24:18.707
Dixon, I'm not invited
to Naomi's party.

24:18.749 --> 24:20.167
No, everybody is.

24:20.209 --> 24:23.754
Democrats, Republicans,
Communists, even you.

24:23.796 --> 24:25.214
What? Look,

24:25.256 --> 24:28.050
I would do it myself, but
nobody wants to know somebody

24:28.092 --> 24:29.885
if they don't already
know them, so...

24:29.927 --> 24:31.637
You got to do this for me.

24:31.678 --> 24:35.141
Please, just help a
brother out, please?

24:35.182 --> 24:37.184
So, just a
quick dinner,

24:37.226 --> 24:38.602
and then we go straight home.

24:38.644 --> 24:40.271
No, no, no, no, no.
No rush!

24:40.313 --> 24:43.357
Navid and I are going
to sneak out of Naomi's party,

24:43.399 --> 24:46.235
we're gonna come back here, so
just bring her home super late.

24:46.277 --> 24:48.154
You girls have fun!
Mm.

24:48.195 --> 24:49.655
Mm.

24:49.696 --> 24:51.573
They just want to have sex.

24:51.615 --> 24:54.910
Good night.

24:58.496 --> 25:00.540
(door closes)

25:00.582 --> 25:02.876
(music begins playing)

25:12.719 --> 25:14.263
Hidden treasure.

25:14.305 --> 25:16.182
(laughs)

25:17.975 --> 25:19.352
What is this?

25:21.519 --> 25:23.730

Oh, thank you.
Take off a couple more layers.

26:30.548 --> 26:33.133
Max, hi, honey. What?!

26:33.175 --> 26:34.718
Ah, I hate the 405!

26:34.760 --> 26:36.303
Okay, well, just hurry.

26:36.345 --> 26:38.055
I love you, too.

26:38.097 --> 26:39.848
Okay, bye.

26:39.890 --> 26:41.225
Hey.

26:41.267 --> 26:42.851
Well, good job.

26:42.893 --> 26:45.020
How does your father know
Cobra Starship?

26:45.062 --> 26:47.523
Oh, I'll be more than happy
to explain in a quieter place.

26:47.565 --> 26:48.857
How's your room?

26:48.899 --> 26:50.859
No, no. No,
this is not happening.

26:50.901 --> 26:53.904
Okay? And you know what?
Would you look at that?

26:53.946 --> 26:55.531
We just ran out
of sparkling water.

26:55.573 --> 26:57.283
I'm gonna go get some.
It's outside.

26:57.324 --> 26:58.992
Perfect.

27:00.286 --> 27:02.037
I...

27:02.079 --> 27:03.830
Oh, you are not getting
sparkling water.

27:03.872 --> 27:06.417
You just can't deal with
how I make you feel.

27:06.459 --> 27:08.626
You make me feel
like I need a bath.

27:08.668 --> 27:09.878
Oh, perfect.
Shower's upstairs.

27:09.920 --> 27:11.505
You know what?
(laughs)

27:11.547 --> 27:13.299
Get out!
What?

27:13.340 --> 27:14.508
Go!

27:14.550 --> 27:15.759
Shoo! Get lost.

27:15.801 --> 27:18.471
I... I am a good person,
and I have a boyfriend.

27:18.512 --> 27:20.889
Well, you're only as good
as your last good-bye, honey.

27:20.931 --> 27:23.016
Then, good, good, good-bye.
Naomi, just shut up

27:23.058 --> 27:24.393
for a second, okay?

27:24.435 --> 27:26.270
You're an idiot.

27:26.312 --> 27:27.771
The door locks automatically,

27:27.813 --> 27:28.981
Austin.

27:29.022 --> 27:30.190
(sighs)

27:30.232 --> 27:33.777
Hello?!

27:33.819 --> 27:36.280
Can someone please
let us in? Hello!

27:36.322 --> 27:38.115
You know, maybe you shouldn't
have such loud parties.

27:38.157 --> 27:41.785
Be quiet, and help me get back
into my house!

27:41.827 --> 27:43.703
(sighs)

27:44.830 --> 27:45.956
(grunting)

27:45.998 --> 27:47.374
Hello?!

27:48.542 --> 27:50.877
Okay, uh, listen, Leila,

27:50.919 --> 27:53.339
if you get bored,
we could totally go home.

27:53.380 --> 27:56.842
Why? I thought these guys were
big friends of this girl, Bree.

27:56.883 --> 27:59.178
Well, they are, but I don't
really know them that well.

27:59.219 --> 28:00.762
Annie, you
brought somebody!

28:00.804 --> 28:02.055
Oh, great.

28:02.097 --> 28:04.057
Hi. I'm Leila.

28:04.099 --> 28:05.559
MAN:
Well, hello, Leila.

28:05.601 --> 28:10.063
I can see this dinner is going
to be worth every penny.

28:10.105 --> 28:11.940
Well, may I buy you
something to drink?

28:11.982 --> 28:16.445
Please. Very dry martini,
two olives. I'm starved.

28:16.487 --> 28:17.779
I'm-I'm sorry, but Leila,

28:17.821 --> 28:19.490
you know
you shouldn't be drinking.

28:20.782 --> 28:23.661
Well, she's an alcoholic.

28:23.701 --> 28:25.245
BREE:
Oh.
Oops, busted.

28:25.287 --> 28:26.664
Anyone got any weed?

28:40.344 --> 28:42.262
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

28:42.304 --> 28:43.430
Shall we?
Yeah.

28:43.472 --> 28:45.391
(camera shutters clicking)

28:49.687 --> 28:50.854
Good luck to you.

28:50.896 --> 28:52.147
Yeah.

28:52.189 --> 28:54.191
After shaking
that man's hand,

28:54.233 --> 28:56.360
I better count and make
sure I have all my fingers.

28:56.402 --> 28:57.528
(laughter)

28:57.570 --> 28:58.696
Oh, Marissa,

28:58.737 --> 29:00.113
this is Erin Silver,

29:00.155 --> 29:01.781
the videographer
I was telling you about.

29:01.823 --> 29:03.242
Oh, so you're
the video whiz.

29:03.283 --> 29:05.536
I guess, yeah, sort of.

29:05.578 --> 29:07.580
I hope I'm up to it.

29:07.621 --> 29:10.207
Oh, you are if you believe
in what you're doing.

29:10.249 --> 29:11.709
You want to help people?

29:11.750 --> 29:14.294
You don't just say it's
complicated, even if it is.

29:14.336 --> 29:16.672
You work through the
complications, and you do it.

29:16.714 --> 29:18.632
I like that.

29:18.674 --> 29:20.300
So, you're in?

29:20.342 --> 29:22.636
Yeah, I'm in.
Good.

29:22.678 --> 29:25.055
I swear you're gonna
suffer for this.

29:25.097 --> 29:26.848
Oh, I'm suffering.

29:26.890 --> 29:28.016
And it's so sweet.

29:28.058 --> 29:29.184
(Naomi sighs)

29:29.226 --> 29:30.436
Stop right there.
Do not move.

29:30.477 --> 29:32.020
This is my house.

29:32.062 --> 29:34.690
Let's see those hands.

29:41.447 --> 29:45.534
Okay, I understand there
are very important people

29:45.576 --> 29:47.035
inside the party.

29:47.077 --> 29:49.246
I'm Naomi Clark,

29:49.288 --> 29:52.583
a very important person
outside the party.

29:52.625 --> 29:53.917
And he is?

29:53.959 --> 29:58.213
I haven't the faintest idea
who he is.

29:58.255 --> 30:00.633
You have no I.D., and you're
breaking into a political event.

30:00.674 --> 30:02.050
To get back into my house.

30:02.092 --> 30:03.719
It's my party.
You can ask anyone.

30:03.761 --> 30:06.305
I mean, who else would come
up with "Strip the Vote"?

30:06.346 --> 30:08.932
Uh, actually, that was me,
and there is an easy way

30:08.974 --> 30:10.726
to prove this is Naomi Clark and

30:10.768 --> 30:12.144
this is her house.

30:12.185 --> 30:13.520
If you just check
the name for priors.

30:13.562 --> 30:15.773
She was busted for growing pot
about three months ago?

30:15.814 --> 30:18.858
Austin!

30:18.900 --> 30:20.694
It's not true.

30:22.321 --> 30:24.698
Are you really throwing us
into a van?!

30:26.866 --> 30:28.494
You know...

30:28.535 --> 30:30.829
Don't... speak.

30:30.870 --> 30:32.247
Mm.

30:32.289 --> 30:33.624
(sighs)

30:33.666 --> 30:35.292
Not only are these people
impossible,

30:35.334 --> 30:37.544
but they are absolutely stupid!

30:37.586 --> 30:39.797
Do they really think
a dangerous subversive

30:39.838 --> 30:41.465
could afford a dress like this?

30:41.507 --> 30:44.301
(sighs)

30:44.343 --> 30:47.721
It's... it's really hot in here.

30:47.763 --> 30:49.139
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

30:49.181 --> 30:51.057
Might as well settle in,
you know?

30:51.099 --> 30:53.686
What are you doing?

30:53.727 --> 30:55.688
It's hot in here.

30:56.855 --> 30:58.732
Phew!

31:02.736 --> 31:05.155
TEDDY:
So, if you're working
for Marissa,

31:05.197 --> 31:07.491
does that mean you
and I can't be friends, either?

31:07.533 --> 31:09.034
If you and I are
still friends

31:09.075 --> 31:10.828
after you came out
while we were dating,

31:10.869 --> 31:12.788
I don't think an election
can pull us apart.

31:12.830 --> 31:14.414
See, why can't Shane say
something like that?

31:14.456 --> 31:15.666
I mean, why

31:15.708 --> 31:17.376
does he have to think
our feelings depend on politics?

31:17.417 --> 31:20.045
I mean, this is about
family for me.

31:20.086 --> 31:22.922
Well, I mean, maybe
you just need to tell him that.

31:27.052 --> 31:30.806
God, look. Adrianna.

31:30.848 --> 31:32.432
You want me to go
say something?

31:32.474 --> 31:33.851
No, thanks.

31:33.892 --> 31:35.185
Got worse problems
to deal with than her.

31:35.227 --> 31:36.687
I got to go find Navid.

31:36.729 --> 31:38.188
Bye.

31:38.230 --> 31:39.773
Bye.

31:39.815 --> 31:41.066
Here.

31:41.107 --> 31:43.861
Okay, well, he can't
promise anything.

31:43.902 --> 31:46.029
But I really hope
that he likes your EP.

31:46.071 --> 31:47.656
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.

31:47.698 --> 31:48.907
Oh!

31:52.160 --> 31:54.788
Where have you been
my entire life?

31:54.830 --> 31:56.122
Hey.

31:56.164 --> 31:57.541
Hey.

31:57.583 --> 31:59.418
Stop. Stop. Stop.

31:59.459 --> 32:00.586
What did I do?

32:00.627 --> 32:03.296
We need to talk.

32:03.338 --> 32:04.964
I found the money.

32:05.006 --> 32:06.759
Tell me what it's for.

32:06.800 --> 32:08.927
Please. You have
to tell me now. I...

32:08.968 --> 32:11.471
Oh, hey, just, I needed
some money, that's all.

32:11.513 --> 32:13.557
Well, then Bieber-- he
rented a studio space...

32:13.599 --> 32:15.893
Bieber pays his bills in cash?

32:15.934 --> 32:17.977
I found $100,000 in that bag.

32:18.019 --> 32:19.979
Plus, you bought Dixon

32:20.021 --> 32:22.274
a recording studio for a week,

32:22.315 --> 32:24.651
and then you financed
my commercial shoot.

32:24.693 --> 32:27.571
That is not a fee for renting
a stage at Shirazi Studios.

32:27.613 --> 32:30.574
God, it is kind of.

32:30.616 --> 32:33.493
Do remember the dirtbag
my sister was dating?

32:33.535 --> 32:36.580
I borrowed money from my Uncle
Amal to buy this guy off,

32:36.622 --> 32:40.918
but my uncle is now making me
pay it back in stage space.

32:40.959 --> 32:44.170
He's got stolen cars back there.

32:44.212 --> 32:46.089
What?

32:47.340 --> 32:49.342
Go to the police.

32:49.384 --> 32:51.511
No, if I go to the
cops, I'm implicated.

32:51.553 --> 32:53.430
I'd go to jail.
Do you want that?

32:53.472 --> 32:54.807
No, but you can't
take the money.

32:54.848 --> 32:56.057
You're a good guy.

32:56.099 --> 32:57.935
Yeah, who is
stuck in a mess.

32:57.976 --> 32:59.770
Yeah, I'm trying
to fix this, okay?

32:59.812 --> 33:02.606
But the only good I can do is to
let my uncle do something bad.

33:02.648 --> 33:05.024
Navid... I don't know, okay?

33:05.066 --> 33:06.944
I got to go.

33:08.612 --> 33:09.905
Silver?

33:11.406 --> 33:12.616
(sighs)

33:12.658 --> 33:13.826
I love you.

33:13.867 --> 33:16.411
I love you, too.

33:21.541 --> 33:23.418
Hey.
Hey.

33:23.460 --> 33:25.545
You decide to join me up there?

33:25.587 --> 33:27.506
Uncle Charles,
I-I still don't know.

33:27.547 --> 33:28.799
Son, listen to me.

33:28.841 --> 33:30.634
I believe in things
and stand for things

33:30.676 --> 33:32.010
that-that some people
disagree with.

33:32.051 --> 33:33.971
You know, maybe
that makes me old-fashioned,

33:34.012 --> 33:37.975
but part of being old-fashioned
is sticking by my own.

33:38.016 --> 33:40.894
Whatever you decide to do
about this campaign,

33:40.936 --> 33:42.729
nothing can change that.

33:42.771 --> 33:46.024
All right. Thanks.

33:46.065 --> 33:48.109
Yeah.

33:50.028 --> 33:53.406
MAN:
Tijuana sounds good.

33:53.448 --> 33:55.826
Okay, guys, well,
we've seen the ocean,

33:55.868 --> 33:59.078
so I think it's about time
we call it a night, yeah?

33:59.120 --> 34:00.747
(gasps)
I know. Let's go
skinny-dipping!

34:00.789 --> 34:02.374
Oh, no, no, no, no.

34:02.415 --> 34:04.501
No, no, you keep
your shirt on, okay?

34:04.543 --> 34:06.336
You can't tell
me what to do.

34:06.378 --> 34:08.672
Oh, yes, I can,
and this stops now, all right?

34:08.714 --> 34:10.549
No... no skinny-dipping,
we are not going

34:10.590 --> 34:12.467
to a strip club,
and we are not

34:12.509 --> 34:14.219
going to Tijuana
for Mojitos.

34:14.260 --> 34:16.262
Well, if we aren't
gonna have any fun,

34:16.304 --> 34:19.725
then what are they
paying you for?

34:19.766 --> 34:21.018
What?

34:21.059 --> 34:22.728
Come on.
Those guys aren't your friends.

34:22.768 --> 34:26.481
The guy even said, dinner
with us is worth every penny.

34:26.523 --> 34:29.025
You get paid to hang
out with them, right?

34:29.067 --> 34:32.195
Oh, my God, Leila,
you cannot tell anybody.

34:32.237 --> 34:34.739
Okay? Please, promise me.
I could get kicked out of CU.

34:34.781 --> 34:36.742
I don't even know
what I would...

34:36.783 --> 34:38.827
Oh, don't get all sad
and pathetic.

34:38.869 --> 34:40.579
I won't tell anyone.

34:41.746 --> 34:45.083
So do I get a cut?

34:45.123 --> 34:47.835
MARISSA:
Good evening, everybody.

34:47.878 --> 34:50.922
I would love to tell you
why you should vote for me,

34:50.964 --> 34:52.925
but this is a bipartisan event,

34:52.966 --> 34:55.092
so I'll just say,

34:55.134 --> 34:58.764
it's easy to say,
"I'm a good person,

34:58.805 --> 35:01.558
and I think the right things."

35:01.600 --> 35:03.435
But thinking right

35:03.476 --> 35:06.229
just isn't the same
as doing right.

35:06.271 --> 35:08.607
So get out,
get registered,

35:08.648 --> 35:11.401
and fight for what you believe.

35:11.443 --> 35:13.319
Thank you.

35:13.361 --> 35:16.531
(applause and cheering)

35:20.786 --> 35:23.204
My opponent and I may
not agree on much,

35:23.246 --> 35:26.499
but I support everything
she just said.

35:26.541 --> 35:29.335
We live in a country
where every voice

35:29.377 --> 35:31.755
and every vote counts.

35:31.797 --> 35:34.674
And to get your
voice to count

35:34.716 --> 35:36.802
is to stand up for
what you believe.

35:36.843 --> 35:38.095
Yes.

35:38.136 --> 35:40.680
Which is why I am proud
to stand here tonight

35:40.722 --> 35:43.141
with the many different voices
that make up my family.

35:43.182 --> 35:45.060
(applause)

35:57.114 --> 35:58.949
NAOMI:
Where are they?!

35:58.991 --> 36:01.159
It's so hot in here.

36:01.200 --> 36:03.202
What if we suffocate?

36:03.244 --> 36:04.663
I mean, I can't...

36:04.704 --> 36:05.872
I can't stand this.

36:05.914 --> 36:08.541
My-my dress is just sticking
to my skin.

36:08.583 --> 36:11.044
Well, I mean, what are you
wearing? Is this rayon?

36:11.086 --> 36:13.379
Well, I'm just saying,
it's not making you any cooler.

36:13.421 --> 36:15.298
You actually think that
I would wear rayon?

36:15.340 --> 36:16.883
It's silk,
you redneck.

36:16.925 --> 36:18.802
Well, silk's worse.

36:18.844 --> 36:21.013
I'm telling you,
just take it off.

36:21.054 --> 36:22.430
It helps.

36:22.472 --> 36:24.390
(sighs)

36:24.432 --> 36:26.768
Don't look.

36:28.728 --> 36:30.605
(sighs)

36:32.649 --> 36:34.109
It's not like I haven't
seen that before, you know?

36:37.278 --> 36:39.156
You know what you are?

36:39.197 --> 36:43.743
You are a spoiled,
little immature brat.

36:43.785 --> 36:47.039
I cannot believe
I was with you.

36:47.080 --> 36:49.207
You just want
to break me and Max up

36:49.248 --> 36:51.001
because that would be
one big hoot.

36:51.043 --> 36:52.251
That's it,
isn't it, Austin?

36:52.293 --> 36:53.753
Tell me the truth.

36:53.795 --> 36:55.964
The truth?
Mm.

36:56.006 --> 36:58.717
The truth is... I don't want
to see you with Max

36:58.758 --> 37:01.260
because I can't stand
the thought of you with him

37:01.302 --> 37:02.595
and not me.

37:02.637 --> 37:04.681
And it's not because
I'm some immature brat.
Mm.

37:04.723 --> 37:06.474
I'm crazy about you, Naomi.

37:19.821 --> 37:22.448
Oh, my God.
Uh...

37:22.490 --> 37:23.742
Where are your clothes?

37:23.783 --> 37:25.702
Hey, it's just really
hot in here, man.

37:25.744 --> 37:27.204
It's not what
it looks like.

37:27.245 --> 37:28.914
Okay, stop.

37:28.955 --> 37:32.250
Yes, it is very hot, but Max,
I have to tell you something.

37:32.291 --> 37:33.459
Okay? Listen.

37:33.501 --> 37:35.754
What?
I...

37:35.795 --> 37:37.130
I had sex with Austin.

37:37.172 --> 37:38.882
MAX:
What?!

37:38.924 --> 37:40.926
Once.

37:40.967 --> 37:42.552
Just now?

37:42.594 --> 37:44.054
God, no, no, no, no, no.

37:44.096 --> 37:45.263
Before you came back.

37:45.304 --> 37:47.348
(sighs)

37:48.516 --> 37:50.894
MAX:
Why didn't...?

37:50.936 --> 37:52.896
Why didn't you just
tell me right away?

37:52.938 --> 37:55.273
Because I don't know.
Because I was embarrassed.

37:55.314 --> 37:56.649
Because I wish
it never happened.

37:56.691 --> 37:57.984
Look,

37:58.026 --> 38:00.737
you bring out
the best in me, okay?

38:00.779 --> 38:02.488
I would never risk
losing that.

38:02.530 --> 38:04.074
(panting)

38:04.116 --> 38:05.658
I feel nothing for you.

38:10.747 --> 38:12.707
AUSTIN:
Hey, um,

38:12.749 --> 38:15.334
if-if the lady says
it's nothing,

38:15.376 --> 38:17.545
it's-it's nothing.

38:17.587 --> 38:19.464
(clears his throat)

38:21.382 --> 38:22.634
Max.

38:22.675 --> 38:24.469
All right, all right.

38:28.598 --> 38:30.600
Shane.

38:30.642 --> 38:32.852
Let me explain.
Don't bother, all
right? I got the idea.

38:32.894 --> 38:34.896
Can't you understand?
This is about my family.

38:34.938 --> 38:37.732
My dad wouldn't even speak
to me after I came out.

38:37.774 --> 38:39.025
My parents were shocked
when I came out, too.

38:39.067 --> 38:40.193
Your dad'll get over it.

38:40.235 --> 38:41.611
I don't know that.

38:41.653 --> 38:44.114
But I do know
my Uncle Charles backed me up

38:44.156 --> 38:46.158
when no one else
in my family would.

38:46.199 --> 38:47.450
Yeah, well, great.

38:47.492 --> 38:49.202
You can be gay in private,
but just don't ask

38:49.244 --> 38:50.453
for any civil rights
or anything, right?

38:50.495 --> 38:52.580
Your uncle is
just using you

38:52.622 --> 38:54.540
for votes that he
doesn't even deserve.

38:54.582 --> 38:56.126
And what are you doing?

38:56.168 --> 38:58.962
Using "gay" to mean
I have to think like you?

38:59.004 --> 39:03.008
You expect me to stand for stuff
I've never even thought about,

39:03.049 --> 39:05.343
or if I did,
you know what?

39:05.384 --> 39:08.429
90% of the time,
I probably agree with my uncle.

39:08.471 --> 39:11.474
But this isn't about politics
for me, Shane. This is my life.

39:11.516 --> 39:13.143
I knew when I came out,

39:13.185 --> 39:15.687
I'd lose people I cared about.

39:15.728 --> 39:17.438
Like my dad.

39:17.480 --> 39:19.858
And now I have one chance
to still have a family,

39:19.899 --> 39:23.028
and I am not going
to let it slip by.

39:23.069 --> 39:25.404
Even if it means losing people
like you.

39:32.537 --> 39:34.497
ADRIANNA:
Liam,

39:34.539 --> 39:35.665
are you okay?

39:35.707 --> 39:37.876
Yeah.

39:37.917 --> 39:39.460
No.

39:39.502 --> 39:40.503
I will be.

39:40.545 --> 39:41.838
Oh, come here, you.

39:41.880 --> 39:43.673
Oh, you are the best

39:43.715 --> 39:45.842
ever.

39:45.884 --> 39:47.344
Hello.

39:47.385 --> 39:49.012
Why? What happened?

39:49.054 --> 39:52.182
Cobra Starship--
their manager loved my EP.

39:52.224 --> 39:53.266
They're putting me up
on their Web site

39:53.308 --> 39:54.517
as their favorite new
artist of the month.

39:54.559 --> 39:57.020
Guys, it's happening.
I'm getting there.

39:57.062 --> 39:58.230
(Liam laughs,
Adrianna whoops)

39:58.271 --> 40:00.148
That is so wonderful. Oh.
Bring it in, come here.

40:00.190 --> 40:02.650
I'm so proud of you.

40:02.692 --> 40:04.986
These things happen fast,
though, okay,

40:05.028 --> 40:07.030
so I'm sure
that this whole thing

40:07.072 --> 40:08.656
is great, but
promise me

40:08.698 --> 40:09.657
you'll be careful.

40:09.699 --> 40:11.201
Are you kidding me?

40:11.243 --> 40:13.328
This is me
that you're talking to. Promise?

40:13.370 --> 40:14.704
I swear. Guys,

40:14.746 --> 40:16.706
I'm blowing up, huh?

40:16.748 --> 40:18.083
Is the bar
still open?
For you.

40:18.124 --> 40:19.625
Thank you, sir.

40:26.758 --> 40:28.634
Hey.

40:30.762 --> 40:32.097
Ready to go?

40:32.138 --> 40:34.224
I'm not coming with you.

40:35.767 --> 40:39.396
I want to stay with Naomi
for a little while.

40:39.437 --> 40:41.564
You and Leila can have my place.

40:41.606 --> 40:44.067
Look, Silver, I tried...
I tried to explain to you.

40:44.109 --> 40:45.568
I know, and I know you.

40:45.610 --> 40:48.947
You're a good guy
who has to do something bad.

40:48.988 --> 40:50.073
Except that you don't.

40:50.115 --> 40:52.658
Good guys do good things.

40:54.202 --> 40:57.080
I just want you
to do what's right.

40:57.122 --> 40:59.082
It's complicated.

40:59.124 --> 41:00.583
No, it's not.

41:00.625 --> 41:02.001
End this thing with Amal.

41:03.795 --> 41:09.217
I can't.

41:09.259 --> 41:11.261
Then I can't be with you.
