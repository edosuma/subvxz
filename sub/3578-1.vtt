TEACHER: Euler's
equation says that if you

04:12.586 --> 04:16.357
Cut the surface of a sphere
into faces, edges, and vertices,

04:16.457 --> 04:20.461
And let F be the number of
faces, E, the number of edges,

04:20.560 --> 04:23.163
V, the number of vertices,
then you will always

04:23.263 --> 04:28.569
Get... Reggie Kipper.

04:28.669 --> 04:32.072
V minus E plus F equals 2.

18:12.259 --> 18:13.059
I just want to let you
know, Eleanor's gonna

18:13.160 --> 18:14.026
Stay the night tonight.

18:14.127 --> 18:14.927
Where's she gonna sleep?

18:15.027 --> 18:15.795
FRIEND: On the couch.

18:15.895 --> 18:16.829
What's the problem?

18:16.929 --> 18:17.864
This isn't a freakin' hotel.

18:17.964 --> 18:19.532
God, a nightmare she is.

18:19.632 --> 18:22.101
Is it going to be OK
for me to stay here?

18:22.202 --> 18:23.703
Yeah, don't worry.

18:23.803 --> 18:25.338
If she wasn't such a pain in the
ass, I'd let you stay longer,

18:25.438 --> 18:26.773
But technically it's her place.

18:26.873 --> 18:28.141
Oh, it's fine.

18:28.241 --> 18:29.176
Tonight is fine.

18:29.276 --> 18:30.143
I have somewhere to go tomorrow.

18:30.243 --> 18:31.978
FRIEND: You sure?

18:32.078 --> 18:33.546
Yeah.

18:33.646 --> 18:36.048
I'm just going to lay down and
read my book, get up early,

18:36.149 --> 18:37.750
And try to find a job.

18:37.850 --> 18:39.186
Oh, you know what?

18:39.286 --> 18:40.653
Here you go.

18:40.753 --> 18:41.488
Call these people.

18:41.588 --> 18:42.855
My friend Abby told me about it.

18:42.955 --> 18:44.591
It's like a temp agency.

18:44.691 --> 18:45.525
Au pair service?

18:45.625 --> 18:46.359
Yeah.

18:46.459 --> 18:47.194
It's like a service for nannies.

18:47.294 --> 18:48.995
You ever babysit?

18:49.095 --> 18:50.363
Yeah, I guess.

18:50.463 --> 18:51.598
For my little sister.

18:51.698 --> 18:52.999
Well, there you go.

18:53.099 --> 18:54.201
Call them up, tell them you have
experience babysitting, taking

18:54.301 --> 18:55.635
Care of kids, or whatever.

18:55.735 --> 18:57.737
Oh, my friend Abby got a
job taking care of the kids

18:57.837 --> 18:59.239
Up... what's her name?

18:59.339 --> 19:03.075
The British girl from that show?

19:03.176 --> 19:06.145
Anyway, just dress
nice, go in there,

19:06.246 --> 19:08.348
Bullshit them about
your experience.

19:08.448 --> 19:10.583
I was gonna go in there
myself, but they check

19:10.683 --> 19:12.952
To see if you have a
criminal record, so...

19:13.052 --> 19:15.555
Thanks.

19:15.655 --> 19:16.289
OK.

19:16.389 --> 19:17.790
Well, I'll see you later?

19:17.890 --> 19:19.292
Lock it, will you?

19:50.122 --> 19:51.824
FRIEND: Forget about Sal, Mom.

19:51.924 --> 19:52.792
Sal's not coming back.

19:52.892 --> 19:55.061
I'm not interested in Sal.

19:55.161 --> 19:56.296
Mom!

19:56.396 --> 19:59.299
Mom, I'm not interested in Sal!

19:59.399 --> 20:00.300
Mom, stop talking.

20:00.400 --> 20:03.002
Stop talking while I'm talking.

20:03.102 --> 20:04.937
Stop talking, Mom!

20:05.037 --> 20:05.905
God damn it!

20:11.478 --> 20:14.614
I've been working
in a bar-restaurant,

20:14.714 --> 20:19.452
And I've been
babysitting mostly.

20:19.552 --> 20:20.152
OK.

20:20.253 --> 20:20.987
Like, as a nanny.

20:21.087 --> 20:23.022
WOMAN: A nanny?

20:23.122 --> 20:24.223
Yeah.

20:24.324 --> 20:29.762
I... I was a babysitter
for a family.

20:29.862 --> 20:32.098
WOMAN: And did you want to
list them as a reference?

20:32.198 --> 20:37.870
No, because they
moved back to Europe.

20:37.970 --> 20:39.772
They're from Belgium.

20:39.872 --> 20:42.008
OK, and is there any
way I could contact them?

20:42.108 --> 20:43.610
Probably not.

20:43.710 --> 20:45.978
I could see if I could get
their new number there,

20:46.078 --> 20:46.946
But probably not.

20:49.849 --> 20:52.385
I also took care of
my little sister.

20:52.485 --> 20:55.655
I pretty much took care
of her from the time

20:55.755 --> 20:58.658
She was born until she
was in high school.

20:58.758 --> 21:00.993
My mom worked full
time when we were kids,

21:01.093 --> 21:04.331
So I pretty much raised her.

21:04.431 --> 21:08.868
So I guess you could call
my mom or my sister... I

21:08.968 --> 21:09.736
Mean as a reference.

21:13.005 --> 21:14.040
WOMAN: OK.

21:14.140 --> 21:14.907
Could I see your
driver's license?

21:21.381 --> 21:22.982
Why don't you have
a seat out there?

21:35.227 --> 21:37.697
Six-letter word
for "most spare."

21:37.797 --> 21:39.198
Merest.

21:39.298 --> 21:41.000
Merest?

21:41.100 --> 21:43.803
M-E-R-E-S-T, from
mere... that is,

21:43.903 --> 21:49.241
Solely or no more or better
than what is specified.

21:49.342 --> 21:51.744
Merest, the smallest
or slightest.

21:54.814 --> 21:55.715
[Phone ringing]

21:55.815 --> 21:56.148
Yeah?

21:56.248 --> 21:58.618
What?

21:58.718 --> 22:00.820
It's none of your fucking
business where I stayed.

22:00.920 --> 22:03.155
Do I ask you where
you go all night?

22:03.255 --> 22:06.292
It happens all the
fucking time, Dennis.

22:06.393 --> 22:07.660
And I told you, I'm finished.

22:07.760 --> 22:09.462
Oh, and thanks for getting
me fired from my job

22:09.562 --> 22:11.364
With your little tantrum.

22:11.464 --> 22:13.132
What did you think would happen?

22:13.232 --> 22:14.166
What?

22:14.266 --> 22:15.968
No, I'm not coming back.

22:16.068 --> 22:16.569
I told...

22:16.669 --> 22:17.670
OK.

22:17.770 --> 22:19.105
We don't usually move
forward until we've

22:19.205 --> 22:20.807
Had a chance to check
everything over thoroughly,

22:20.907 --> 22:23.209
But something's come in that
you might be perfect for,

22:23.309 --> 22:24.644
And I don't want to miss out.

22:24.744 --> 22:26.479
It would start immediately,
possibly this afternoon.

22:26.579 --> 22:28.047
How does that work?

22:28.147 --> 22:29.081
Yeah.

22:29.181 --> 22:29.916
Yes, I can start immediately.

22:30.016 --> 22:31.117
This afternoon?

22:31.217 --> 22:32.184
Yeah.

22:32.284 --> 22:34.554
It's a live-in situation.

22:34.654 --> 22:35.788
OK.

22:35.888 --> 22:37.156
They're looking for someone
on a temporary basis,

22:37.256 --> 22:38.357
A couple of months,
could go longer.

22:38.458 --> 22:39.792
How does that work?

22:39.892 --> 22:40.827
It's fine.

22:40.927 --> 22:42.294
It's a family on
the Upper West Side.

22:42.395 --> 22:43.696
It would essentially
require you looking

22:43.796 --> 22:45.698
After their 12-year-old,
a little light housework.

22:45.798 --> 22:46.298
Yes?

22:46.399 --> 22:47.800
Yes.

22:47.900 --> 22:49.001
Great.

22:49.101 --> 22:49.969
Here's the address.

22:50.069 --> 22:51.404
They'll be expecting you.

22:51.504 --> 22:53.406
It's a brief interview with
the woman of the house.

22:56.409 --> 22:57.910
On your way, stop
at a drugstore,

22:58.010 --> 23:00.379
Pick up a little light blush and
something subtle for your eyes.

23:00.480 --> 23:01.414
It's a bit much.

23:01.514 --> 23:02.415
Better get moving.

24:18.057 --> 24:19.992
Hello?

24:20.092 --> 24:20.593
Hi.

24:23.930 --> 24:25.532
Barbara Kipper.

24:25.632 --> 24:26.265
Eleanor Logan.

24:29.636 --> 24:30.136
Well, then.

24:33.439 --> 24:34.841
Let's go in the
library and chat.

24:38.578 --> 24:39.812
You are from upstate?

24:39.912 --> 24:40.847
Yeah.

24:40.947 --> 24:45.484
OK, well, my nanny
left unexpectedly.

24:45.585 --> 24:46.886
My husband is in
China, in Beijing.

24:46.986 --> 24:48.888
That's where his company,
his business is based.

24:48.988 --> 24:51.257
I will be joining him
there in less than a week.

24:51.357 --> 24:52.659
Do you smoke?

24:52.759 --> 24:53.860
No.

24:53.960 --> 24:55.194
If you're going to smoke,
only on the balconies.

24:55.294 --> 24:56.696
There are 15
different balconies.

24:56.796 --> 24:59.832
Choose one if you want to smoke.

24:59.932 --> 25:00.399
OK.

25:00.499 --> 25:01.634
I don't smoke.

25:01.734 --> 25:03.435
So Reggie, what
did Claire tell you?

25:03.536 --> 25:05.371
Anything?

25:05.471 --> 25:06.072
Very little.

25:06.172 --> 25:07.574
He's 12.

25:07.674 --> 25:09.375
Basically you get him to and
from school and make sure

25:09.475 --> 25:10.076
He eats.

25:10.176 --> 25:11.343
That's it.

25:11.443 --> 25:13.079
Anything else you need,
Esa will help you.

25:13.179 --> 25:13.880
Esa?

25:13.980 --> 25:15.081
Yes, ma'am?

25:15.181 --> 25:16.115
Christ.

25:16.215 --> 25:17.216
You're two feet away from me.

25:17.316 --> 25:18.284
Don't do that.

25:18.384 --> 25:20.052
Yes, ma'am.

25:20.152 --> 25:23.289
Helena here is going
to take over for Tula.

25:23.389 --> 25:24.256
Eleanor.

25:24.356 --> 25:25.324
Do you have a boyfriend?

25:25.424 --> 25:26.492
No.

25:26.593 --> 25:27.927
If you want to
see your boyfriend,

25:28.027 --> 25:29.495
Go to his house or wherever,
because it is strictly

25:29.596 --> 25:30.329
Prohibited here.

25:30.429 --> 25:31.230
OK?

25:31.330 --> 25:32.131
OK.

25:32.231 --> 25:33.232
See, here's the thing.

25:33.332 --> 25:35.301
He's got to eat.

25:35.401 --> 25:37.637
If you don't make him, he won't.

25:37.737 --> 25:38.805
He only likes certain things.

25:38.905 --> 25:40.372
He's very picky about it.

25:40.472 --> 25:44.043
No meat, vegetarian only.

25:44.143 --> 25:46.412
He doesn't eat meat,
fish, or poultry.

25:46.512 --> 25:50.482
He doesn't eat anything except
tofu and vegetarian stuff.

25:50.583 --> 25:52.251
What time is he out today?

25:52.351 --> 25:54.120
He has his music until 4:30.

25:54.220 --> 25:55.154
Great.

25:55.254 --> 25:56.656
So you will pick him up at 4:30.

25:56.756 --> 26:02.328
I absolutely do not want him
walking to or from school.

26:02.428 --> 26:03.896
A, it's not safe.

26:03.996 --> 26:08.200
B, that's why I employ a driver.

26:08.300 --> 26:10.803
So we're set.

26:10.903 --> 26:14.106
Esa, make sure Laura here
gets the whole rundown

26:14.206 --> 26:15.074
On everything.

26:15.174 --> 26:17.744
I've got my massage
in 15 minutes.

26:17.844 --> 26:19.979
I'm going to take my
pill and get ready.

26:32.058 --> 26:35.962
[Music playing]

29:11.217 --> 29:13.619
Uh, excuse me.

29:13.719 --> 29:14.921
Hi.

29:15.021 --> 29:15.621
Hi.

29:15.721 --> 29:17.256
I'm Eleanor.

29:17.356 --> 29:19.491
I'm here to pick you up.

29:19.591 --> 29:22.661
Did they tell you?

29:22.761 --> 29:24.063
They didn't tell you.

29:24.163 --> 29:25.364
OK.

29:25.464 --> 29:26.732
Well, the car's right there.

29:26.833 --> 29:28.935
Actually, I prefer to walk.

29:29.035 --> 29:32.939
Well, your mom really
wants you to take the car.

29:33.039 --> 29:35.241
Despite what my
mother might have said,

29:35.341 --> 29:37.944
I have an arrangement with
the guy... an understanding,

29:38.044 --> 29:39.645
A financial agreement.

29:39.745 --> 29:41.113
Now, I aim to walk home.

29:41.213 --> 29:42.048
It's my thing.

29:42.148 --> 29:43.349
I do it every day,
rain or shine.

29:43.449 --> 29:46.752
Period, the end.

29:46.853 --> 29:49.388
Fine.

29:49.488 --> 29:49.989
Fine.

30:14.113 --> 30:14.413
Hey.

30:17.283 --> 30:19.485
Yeah?

30:19.585 --> 30:21.353
Would you hang on a second?

30:25.457 --> 30:26.325
I'm Eleanor.

30:31.397 --> 30:31.898
Reggie.

30:34.566 --> 30:36.235
Pleased to meet you.

30:36.335 --> 30:36.635
Likewise.

30:54.921 --> 30:56.388
Isn't that thing
a little heavy?

30:56.488 --> 30:57.589
Yeah, but I don't mind.

31:00.426 --> 31:01.627
It was pretty amazing.

31:01.727 --> 31:03.395
I'm sorry?

31:03.495 --> 31:04.496
Your playing.

31:04.596 --> 31:09.135
I mean, that piece is
absolutely gorgeous.

31:09.235 --> 31:10.269
Thanks.

31:10.369 --> 31:11.938
The way the viola and
the violins interact,

31:12.038 --> 31:15.307
It's so sad and beautiful.

31:15.407 --> 31:16.542
Who composed that?

31:16.642 --> 31:18.277
Me.

31:18.377 --> 31:19.711
You composed it?

31:19.811 --> 31:20.646
I did.

31:20.746 --> 31:24.016
Oh, wow.

31:24.116 --> 31:26.385
Oh, you must really
love doing that.

31:26.485 --> 31:28.487
I mean, I could tell
you really love to play.

31:28.587 --> 31:29.821
Something to do.

31:29.922 --> 31:33.259
Is that what you want
to do when you grow up?

31:33.359 --> 31:34.593
When I grow up?

31:34.693 --> 31:36.062
Yeah.

31:36.162 --> 31:37.729
No.

31:37.829 --> 31:38.864
Why not?

31:38.965 --> 31:40.066
Why not?

31:40.166 --> 31:42.868
Well, let's see,
first off the prospect

31:42.969 --> 31:44.603
Of ending up a bitter
and lonely drunk

31:44.703 --> 31:46.172
Doesn't quite appeal to me.

31:46.272 --> 31:47.539
OK.

31:47.639 --> 31:50.742
And not to mention the fact
that art, as a language, dead.

31:50.842 --> 31:52.411
It doesn't matter
what you have to say

31:52.511 --> 31:55.447
Or how well you might
be able to say it.

31:55.547 --> 31:56.048
Dead.

31:58.917 --> 32:01.253
Kind of a bleak view.

32:01.353 --> 32:01.954
Yes, it is.

32:11.897 --> 32:13.565
Boom.

32:13.665 --> 32:15.501
Douzeper.

32:15.601 --> 32:16.535
What is that?

32:16.635 --> 32:18.637
Looks like 120 points to me.

32:18.737 --> 32:19.671
It's not a word.

32:19.771 --> 32:21.173
It is a word, dickhead.

32:21.273 --> 32:23.609
Noun, plural, one of
the 12 legendary nights.

32:23.709 --> 32:25.677
You should know that,
with all your Dungeons

32:25.777 --> 32:26.845
And Dragons nonsense.

32:26.945 --> 32:29.281
If you say so.

32:29.381 --> 32:31.883
I can't believe that little
fox is going to be living here.

32:31.984 --> 32:33.452
She is so hot.

32:33.552 --> 32:34.853
Man, is she hot.

32:34.953 --> 32:37.323
That's what you say about every
girl you come in contact with.

32:37.423 --> 32:38.057
No.

32:38.157 --> 32:39.391
Just the super-hot ones.

32:39.491 --> 32:41.427
It's only because
you're confused, awkward,

32:41.527 --> 32:42.328
And insecure.

32:42.428 --> 32:43.695
OK, Mr. Freud.

32:43.795 --> 32:45.998
And convinced you'll never get
a girl to have sex with you.

32:46.098 --> 32:47.333
Right, sure, OK.

This looks so good.

What's the sauce?

32:57.509 --> 32:58.210
Just eat it.

32:58.310 --> 33:00.412
ESA: Meatless brown gluten.

33:00.512 --> 33:01.180
Eat it, Reggie.

33:01.280 --> 33:02.881
It's vegetarian stir fry.

33:02.981 --> 33:05.584
She's always trying to sneak
beef broth into everything.

33:09.055 --> 33:10.256
Sounds like a great set-up.

33:10.356 --> 33:11.757
I can't believe how
fast it all happened.

33:11.857 --> 33:13.992
That's what kind of scares
me about the whole thing.

33:14.093 --> 33:15.227
I talked to the
mother for, like,

33:15.327 --> 33:16.762
10 minutes before
she hires me to take

33:16.862 --> 33:18.230
Care of her 12-year-old son.

33:18.330 --> 33:20.066
Next thing I know,
I'm living there.

33:20.166 --> 33:21.667
Sounds like you
totally lucked out.

33:21.767 --> 33:23.069
I mean, what's the big deal?

33:23.169 --> 33:24.336
They're, like, gazillionaires.

33:24.436 --> 33:25.871
The house is the size
of Grand Central.

33:25.971 --> 33:28.607
And what do I know about taking
care of a 12-year-old boy?

33:28.707 --> 33:29.541
Free room and board.

33:29.641 --> 33:30.542
Plus you get paid.

33:30.642 --> 33:31.677
What more could you want?

33:31.777 --> 33:33.412
And besides, you lived
with Dennis for a year.

33:33.512 --> 33:35.481
You should be fine
with a 12 year old.

33:35.581 --> 33:36.882
Yeah, right.

33:36.982 --> 33:38.484
Maybe just see him
and have some closure.

33:38.584 --> 33:40.619
I mean, you threw his
guitar out the window.

33:40.719 --> 33:41.487
Yeah, that's right.

33:41.587 --> 33:42.621
I did.

33:42.721 --> 33:43.489
Fuck him.

33:43.589 --> 33:44.423
That was my closure.

33:47.226 --> 33:49.528

35:12.211 --> 35:13.812
It's beautiful.

35:13.912 --> 35:15.314
No, it's really not.

35:15.414 --> 35:18.384
I'm not feeling too inspired
for the cello these days.

35:21.553 --> 35:23.622
Is this where you practice?

35:23.722 --> 35:25.724
It's the best
place in the house.

35:25.824 --> 35:26.592
Perfect acoustics.

35:29.127 --> 35:29.695
This place.

35:32.264 --> 35:34.166
I mean, this house
is incredible.

35:34.266 --> 35:38.170
It was built by Captain
Francis Falk in 1898.

35:38.270 --> 35:40.306
He also designed the
Museum of Natural History

35:40.406 --> 35:45.076
And was clearly a fan of big,
overbearing swimming pools.

35:45.177 --> 35:46.578
Why is it empty?

35:46.678 --> 35:50.282
Uh, my mom was going to get
tiles hand-made in Majorca

35:50.382 --> 35:51.950
Or something or other.

35:52.050 --> 35:54.953
I guess she hasn't
gotten around to it.

35:55.053 --> 35:57.789
A lot of things in this house
she hasn't gotten around to do,

35:57.889 --> 35:59.291
As you can plainly see.

35:59.391 --> 36:01.793
Yeah, but in the meantime
you could be swimming in it.

36:01.893 --> 36:03.495
No, not me.

36:03.595 --> 36:04.363
Don't know how.

36:04.463 --> 36:05.096
What?

36:05.197 --> 36:06.131
Why?

36:06.232 --> 36:07.866
I guess nobody ever taught me.

36:10.402 --> 36:12.571
Well, that won't do.

36:12.671 --> 36:13.572
I'll teach you.

36:18.777 --> 36:20.946
Mm.

Please let me know
you need something.

36:31.423 --> 36:33.124
I wish she'd eat
in here with us.

36:33.225 --> 36:34.793
She likes it in there.

36:34.893 --> 36:35.961
That's weird.

36:36.061 --> 36:37.329
Is it?

36:37.429 --> 36:39.865
She likes to eat in
there on her own.

36:39.965 --> 36:41.300
She reads the "TV Guide."

36:41.400 --> 36:44.202
Sometimes she watches Telemundo.

36:44.303 --> 36:47.273
Perhaps you're projecting
your own personal mores

36:47.373 --> 36:48.907
And expectations onto her.

37:29.781 --> 37:31.049
So what's the plan?

37:31.149 --> 37:33.685
You got anything lined up with
your quartet for the summer?

37:33.785 --> 37:36.355
I think I may be a
little burnt on the cello.

37:38.724 --> 37:42.127
It could be you
just need a break.

37:42.227 --> 37:44.029
Yeah.

37:44.129 --> 37:45.864
Maybe I do.

37:45.964 --> 37:48.300
I think I'm gonna take
a break from the cello.

37:52.571 --> 37:55.674
I mean, I was only suggesting
a week or something.

37:55.774 --> 37:57.809
And then, you know,

37:57.909 --> 37:58.677
No.

37:58.777 --> 37:59.778
You're right.

37:59.878 --> 38:02.314
No one under the age
of 75 is interested

38:02.414 --> 38:05.250
In that dusty and
antiquated music anymore.

38:05.351 --> 38:07.152
Its time has come and gone.

38:07.252 --> 38:08.454
That isn't true.

38:08.554 --> 38:09.555
I didn't mean a long break.

38:09.655 --> 38:11.056
I wasn't suggesting that.

38:11.156 --> 38:13.492
No, I think a

38:13.592 --> 38:16.695
It's old-fashioned and obsolete.

38:16.795 --> 38:20.866
Anyway, I don't want
to talk about it.

38:20.966 --> 38:24.102
So where are you from?

38:24.202 --> 38:26.004
Oneida, New York.

38:26.104 --> 38:27.739
It's a little town
near Syracuse.

38:27.839 --> 38:28.374
Of course.

38:28.474 --> 38:29.675
I've heard of it.

38:29.775 --> 38:30.976
Oh?

38:31.076 --> 38:33.479
I was researching a paper
on prewar city design, which

38:33.579 --> 38:37.115
Involved quite a bit of reading
on that particular region.

38:37.215 --> 38:38.584
Oh.

38:38.684 --> 38:40.085
So was it nice
growing up there?

38:42.688 --> 38:44.656
It was nice when I
was little, I guess.

38:44.756 --> 38:46.592
Maybe that's just
how I remember it.

I have an arrangement
with the guy.

44:18.724 --> 44:20.458
Try to understand, OK?

44:20.558 --> 44:24.262
I simply do not belong at camp.

44:24.362 --> 44:25.263
Are you hungry?

44:25.363 --> 44:26.531
I bet you're hungry.

44:26.631 --> 44:28.199
I know this great place
not far from here.

44:28.299 --> 44:29.200
You like eggs Benedict?

44:29.300 --> 44:30.168
It's all organic.

44:30.268 --> 44:32.070
Here, come on.

44:32.170 --> 44:34.472
Wait, hold on.

44:34.572 --> 44:35.073
Hold on.

44:49.788 --> 44:51.857
ELEANOR: $52 for
a spinach salad?

44:51.957 --> 44:53.624
It's a heck of a salad.

44:53.725 --> 44:54.592
Trust me.

44:54.692 --> 44:56.227
Everything here, top notch.

44:56.327 --> 44:58.063
I usually get the
wild mushroom risotto.

44:58.163 --> 45:00.198
Go ahead, get whatever you like.

45:00.298 --> 45:01.166
I got this.

45:01.266 --> 45:03.034
We have an account here.

45:03.134 --> 45:05.203
I guess just the garden salad.

45:05.303 --> 45:07.038
That's all?

45:07.138 --> 45:07.873
Eat.

45:07.973 --> 45:09.674
This guy is a world-class chef.

45:09.775 --> 45:11.810
What are we supposed to
do for the next six weeks?

45:11.910 --> 45:13.678
This is New York City, kid.

45:13.779 --> 45:15.513
Never a loss for
things to do here.

45:15.613 --> 45:16.414
Trust me.

45:16.514 --> 45:17.615
It just seems wrong.

45:17.715 --> 45:19.317
You're supposed to
be in that camp.

45:19.417 --> 45:22.520
Camp Pinnacle is not
an option for me, OK?

45:22.620 --> 45:23.688
It never was.

45:23.789 --> 45:25.290
Now, let's not refer
to camp anymore.

45:25.390 --> 45:26.591
But it's not up to you.

45:26.691 --> 45:27.725
Yes, it is.

45:27.826 --> 45:28.626
No one cares.

45:28.726 --> 45:29.828
No one cares where I am.

45:29.928 --> 45:30.962
That isn't true.

45:31.062 --> 45:32.163
Look, I don't
mean it like that.

45:32.263 --> 45:33.531
It's just a fact.

45:33.631 --> 45:36.501
The operation continues whether
I'm at camp or home reading.

45:36.601 --> 45:39.104
Personally, I'd rather be home
reading if it's all the same.

45:39.204 --> 45:41.172
And it is, believe
me, all the same.

45:41.272 --> 45:42.373
What about Esa?

45:42.473 --> 45:43.508
What about her?

45:43.608 --> 45:45.076
She's fine.

45:45.176 --> 45:46.778
Do you think she's concerned
where I am or what I'm doing?

45:46.878 --> 45:48.579
She works in the house.

45:48.679 --> 45:49.647
It's just weird.

45:49.747 --> 45:51.749
It's so weird, Reggie.

45:51.850 --> 45:53.819
Yes, well, this is my life.

45:53.919 --> 45:55.253
Welcome to the weirdness.

45:55.353 --> 45:57.155
I'm just trying to navigate
a course towards safety

45:57.255 --> 46:01.126
And sanity the best
way I know how.

46:01.226 --> 46:04.095
OK.

46:04.195 --> 46:07.498
[Chuckling]

46:12.170 --> 46:15.073
[Vibrating]

46:20.178 --> 46:22.447
[Vibrating]

46:28.553 --> 46:31.022
[Giggling]

46:51.943 --> 46:54.946
DENNIS: I was about to give up.

46:55.046 --> 46:56.547
What the fuck are you doing?

46:56.647 --> 46:59.050
Clearly I've been trying to
get in touch to talk to you.

46:59.150 --> 47:01.352
No, I'm not trying to play,
like, head games or some shit,

47:01.452 --> 47:02.120
OK?

47:02.220 --> 47:02.954
I'm serious.

47:03.054 --> 47:04.722
I have ended this relationship.

47:04.822 --> 47:06.892
I thought maybe we
could just talk it over.

47:06.992 --> 47:08.793
You fucked around
a million times, OK?

47:08.894 --> 47:10.896
You... you get drunk with
your stupid friends.

47:10.996 --> 47:11.863
You treat me like shit.

47:11.963 --> 47:12.697
So just forget it.

47:12.797 --> 47:13.331
Forget it.

47:13.431 --> 47:14.465
Go home.

47:14.565 --> 47:16.267
Look, I made a mistake,
and I realize it now.

47:16.367 --> 47:17.168
I just want to talk.

47:17.268 --> 47:17.735
We talked.

47:17.835 --> 47:19.137
Stop texting me.

47:19.237 --> 47:19.537
Eleanor?

47:23.174 --> 47:25.810
I mean, ever since you left,
I've been so, like, despondent.

47:25.911 --> 47:28.013
OK, I'm sorry that
you're feeling bad now.

47:28.113 --> 47:29.347
Maybe you should have
thought about that before.

47:29.447 --> 47:30.581
I wrote a bunch
of songs about you.

47:30.681 --> 47:31.582
I want you to hear them.

47:31.682 --> 47:32.650
Jesus Christ.

47:32.750 --> 47:33.651
Let's go get a drink.

47:33.751 --> 47:34.685
Let's go down to Scratcher.

47:34.785 --> 47:35.887
Bill's DJing over there.

47:35.987 --> 47:37.255
ELEANOR: What are
you talking about?

47:37.355 --> 47:38.789
It's just a drink,
just to talk.

47:38.890 --> 47:40.391
Are you listening
to me in any way?

47:40.491 --> 47:41.492
I'm working, you idiot.

47:41.592 --> 47:42.894
I'm all messed up inside.

47:42.994 --> 47:44.262
I haven't been able to sleep.

47:44.362 --> 47:45.663
I haven't eaten.

47:45.763 --> 47:49.267
If you think that this cloying,
whining, like, desperate act is

47:49.367 --> 47:52.537
In any way attractive or
appealing, you're wrong.

47:52.637 --> 47:53.671
So goodbye.

47:53.771 --> 47:55.340
Goodbye.

47:55.440 --> 47:56.674
Eleanor, come on.

47:56.774 --> 47:58.009
Please.

47:58.109 --> 47:59.978
Oh, so you're just going
to be like that now?

48:00.078 --> 48:01.980
So in other words, you're
just going to move on?

48:02.080 --> 48:02.948
Not in other words.

48:03.048 --> 48:04.415
In those exact words.

48:04.515 --> 48:07.285
Well, fine, but you're
going to pay for that guitar.

48:07.385 --> 48:09.387
Make no mistake.

48:09.487 --> 48:10.821
Fucking bitch.

48:10.922 --> 48:12.423
What are you doing out here?

48:12.523 --> 48:13.258
What's going on?

48:13.358 --> 48:13.758
Nothing.

48:13.858 --> 48:14.825
Go inside.

48:14.926 --> 48:16.394
You're going to
pay for my shit.

48:16.494 --> 48:17.195
Fucking bitch.

48:34.579 --> 48:37.415
Hey.

48:37.515 --> 48:38.316
Are you OK?

48:38.416 --> 48:38.816
Yeah.

48:38.916 --> 48:40.718
I'm good.

48:40.818 --> 48:43.154
I'm so sorry about that.

48:43.254 --> 48:44.589
Can I make you a snack?

48:44.689 --> 48:47.125
I can whip up some veggie
soba noodles real quick.

48:47.225 --> 48:49.360
Or how about some tofu curry?

48:49.460 --> 48:51.196
It's no problem.

48:51.296 --> 48:54.199
You should eat something.

48:54.299 --> 48:55.500
Sure.

48:55.600 --> 48:56.968
Great.

48:57.068 --> 48:58.469
We can finish
watching the movie.

49:04.575 --> 49:10.548
If you don't mind me asking,
is he prone to such outbursts?

49:10.648 --> 49:13.151
No.

49:13.251 --> 49:14.585
Not that I was aware, anyway.

49:17.288 --> 49:19.190
What a colossal mistake.

49:24.195 --> 49:26.131
Life is a series of
colossal mistakes.

49:32.170 --> 49:34.839
I'm doing a horrible job
of taking care of you.

49:34.939 --> 49:36.041
What are you talking about?

49:36.141 --> 49:37.408
You're doing a great job.

49:37.508 --> 49:38.509
No.

49:38.609 --> 49:40.411
I don't want you to
know about this stuff.

49:40.511 --> 49:41.646
What stuff?

49:41.746 --> 49:43.381
My stuff.

49:43.481 --> 49:46.117
The sordid details
of my break-up,

49:46.217 --> 49:49.154
The stuff that happens
in my personal life.

49:49.254 --> 49:50.721
We don't know each
other that well,

49:50.821 --> 49:52.190
And you're too
young to understand.

49:52.290 --> 49:53.558
Don't be too sure about that.

49:53.658 --> 49:55.526
I have a great deal
of understanding.

49:55.626 --> 49:56.227
God.

49:56.327 --> 49:58.129
Well beyond my years.

49:58.229 --> 50:02.167
Look, I just don't want
you to worry about it

50:02.267 --> 50:04.202
Or think about it.

50:04.302 --> 50:04.869
OK?

50:04.969 --> 50:05.770
OK.

50:05.870 --> 50:06.737
I won't worry about it.

50:06.837 --> 50:08.239
I'm not worried about it.

50:08.339 --> 50:09.374
Good.

50:09.474 --> 50:11.942
But I can't guarantee
I won't think about it.

50:12.043 --> 50:12.843
It's what I do.

50:12.943 --> 50:13.978
I think about things.

50:14.079 --> 50:17.382
It's my nature.

50:17.482 --> 50:18.849
Fine.

50:18.949 --> 50:20.518
You can think.

50:20.618 --> 50:21.519
Fair enough.

50:30.895 --> 50:32.463
Whoa, really?

50:32.563 --> 50:33.531
What?

50:33.631 --> 50:35.766
An uncharacteristic
lapse by the master.

50:35.866 --> 50:39.270
You just left yourself
open for some brute force.

50:39.370 --> 50:40.571
Got your horsey horse.

50:40.671 --> 50:41.139
Doesn't matter.

50:41.239 --> 50:43.141
I'll still win.

50:43.241 --> 50:44.809
So you know how
we were supposed

50:44.909 --> 50:46.844
To go to Sydney,
Australia, for vacation?

50:46.944 --> 50:47.745
Yeah.

50:47.845 --> 50:48.746
Well, now we're not.

50:48.846 --> 50:49.380
Oh?

50:49.480 --> 50:50.781
Yeah.

50:50.881 --> 50:52.183
My dad lost his shirt in some
deal with this guy in Stanford,

50:52.283 --> 50:54.885
Or some guy named
Stanford, who knows?

50:54.985 --> 50:57.522
Anyhow, I had to
go to karate camp.

50:57.622 --> 50:58.923
That sounds awful.

50:59.023 --> 51:01.526
I mean, why on earth does he
think I need to learn karate?

51:01.626 --> 51:04.395
Maybe 'cause you're constantly
getting your ass kicked.

51:04.495 --> 51:06.897
What I'd really like to do
is this hip-hop dance camp.

51:06.997 --> 51:08.533
That should do wonders
for your profile.

51:08.633 --> 51:10.468
It's like this hip-hop
camp they have... like,

51:10.568 --> 51:12.803
You know, dancing hip-hop
style and stuff like that.

51:12.903 --> 51:13.771
I know what it is.

51:13.871 --> 51:14.872
It's horrifying.

51:14.972 --> 51:15.873
Don't do that.

51:15.973 --> 51:17.007
That's easy for you to say.

51:17.108 --> 51:18.209
You get to sit in
the park all day

51:18.309 --> 51:19.444
With your hot-as-hell nanny.

51:19.544 --> 51:21.512
Yep, that's what I do all day.

51:21.612 --> 51:22.913
Here, check it out.

51:23.013 --> 51:26.517
There are all these super-fly
lookin' ladies in the pamphlet.

51:26.617 --> 51:28.018
Mm-hmm.

51:28.119 --> 51:30.321
And you figure all
these fly-looking ladies

51:30.421 --> 51:32.357
Are going to be there,
just waiting your arrival?

51:32.457 --> 51:33.324
Got to be in it to win it.

51:33.424 --> 51:34.659
Good luck with that, buddy.

51:34.759 --> 51:36.127
Of course my dad said no.

51:36.227 --> 51:37.395
Smart man.

51:37.495 --> 51:38.929
He just made some
vaguely racist remark

51:39.029 --> 51:42.433
And threw it in the trash.

51:42.533 --> 51:44.034
Checkmate.

51:44.135 --> 51:45.270
Rats.

51:45.370 --> 51:46.637
Gotta get your head
out of the clouds.

52:57.608 --> 53:01.312
ELEANOR: I really
love that painting.

53:01.412 --> 53:03.348
REGGIE: She kind
of looks like you.

53:06.016 --> 53:07.184
I beg your pardon?

53:07.285 --> 53:10.154
I mean in the eyes.

53:10.255 --> 53:13.758
Good, because
she's fairly round.

53:13.858 --> 53:18.663
Do you know anything
about Modigliani?

53:18.763 --> 53:19.364
No.

53:19.464 --> 53:20.865
I'll be I'm about to.

53:20.965 --> 53:26.103
He died in penurian squalor
in 1920 at the age of 35.

53:26.203 --> 53:27.071
What's penury?

53:27.171 --> 53:28.406
Extreme poverty.

53:28.506 --> 53:29.407
Mm.

53:29.507 --> 53:30.741
Yeah, he was
discovered by a neighbor

53:30.841 --> 53:33.744
In the final throes of
tubercular meningitis.

53:33.844 --> 53:36.281
Evidently, his bed was
littered with bottles

53:36.381 --> 53:38.916
Of alcohol and
empty sardine cans.

53:39.016 --> 53:40.217
His girlfriend,
Jeanne Hebuterne,

53:40.318 --> 53:42.453
Was there taking care of him.

53:42.553 --> 53:44.188
You'd think she could
have cleared away

53:44.289 --> 53:46.291
Some of the sardine cans.

53:46.391 --> 53:49.660
She was nine months pregnant
with their second child.

53:49.760 --> 53:51.962
Two days after his
death, she threw herself

53:52.062 --> 53:55.900
Backwards from a
fifth-floor window.

53:56.000 --> 53:56.501
Whoa.

54:00.371 --> 54:01.772
Can I ask you a question?

54:01.872 --> 54:03.308
Sure.

54:03.408 --> 54:05.843
When did you first
become so advanced?

54:05.943 --> 54:07.545
I'm not sure I became advanced.

54:07.645 --> 54:11.248
Well, I mean, for instance,
when did you start to read?

54:11.349 --> 54:14.018
I was able to read when
I was 18 months old.

54:14.118 --> 54:16.554
I guess that might have
been when I became advanced.

54:16.654 --> 54:19.089
What were you reading when
you were 18 months old?

54:19.189 --> 54:22.192
My mother walked in, and I
was reading "Oh, the Thinks You"

54:22.293 --> 54:24.194
"Can Think" by Dr. Seuss.

54:24.295 --> 54:24.829
Out loud?

54:24.929 --> 54:25.830
Yep.

54:25.930 --> 54:26.831
She must have flipped out.

54:26.931 --> 54:28.232
She was quite amused.

54:28.333 --> 54:30.635
She'd bring me out at parties.

54:30.735 --> 54:31.969
That's insane.

54:32.069 --> 54:33.538
Yes, it is insane.

54:33.638 --> 54:35.606
It's insane to wake a child
of less than two years of age

54:35.706 --> 54:37.642
And insist that he sit in
the middle of the table

54:37.742 --> 54:40.345
And read "Oh, the
Thinks You Can Think"

54:40.445 --> 54:42.580
Out loud for a bunch
of drunk people.

54:42.680 --> 54:43.814
Holy cow!

54:43.914 --> 54:45.716
And then... let's see.

54:45.816 --> 54:48.185
I guess right around
when I was four,

54:48.285 --> 54:51.221
They figured out I was
a sort of math prodigy,

54:51.322 --> 54:53.591
Solving pretty
intricate math problems.

54:53.691 --> 54:54.792
Wait, what?

54:54.892 --> 54:57.762
Multiplying seven to 10
digit numbers in my head.

54:57.862 --> 55:00.631
I could give you the cube root
of pretty much any number.

55:00.731 --> 55:01.899
Like Rain Man.

55:01.999 --> 55:04.702
No, I believe that character
was an autistic savant.

55:04.802 --> 55:07.838
As you can tell, I'm alert,
extroverted, affable,

55:07.938 --> 55:08.673
And articulate.

55:08.773 --> 55:09.740
Of course.

55:09.840 --> 55:11.342
And not to mention
devilishly handsome.

55:11.442 --> 55:13.277
Not to mention.

55:13.378 --> 55:16.146
For me, it's always been
like a native language...

55:16.246 --> 55:18.282
Numbers, playing
music, composing.

55:18.383 --> 55:19.850
It's just the way I came out.

55:19.950 --> 55:23.454
My father, evidently, was
extremely intelligent.

55:23.554 --> 55:25.690
What does he do in China?

55:25.790 --> 55:26.190
Who?

55:26.290 --> 55:27.425
Your dad.

55:27.525 --> 55:29.059
He doesn't do
anything in China.

55:29.159 --> 55:30.160
He's dead.

55:30.260 --> 55:31.696
My mother remarried.

55:31.796 --> 55:32.997
I'm sorry.

55:33.097 --> 55:33.964
Thanks.

55:34.064 --> 55:35.132
It was a long time ago.

55:35.232 --> 55:37.034
I was three.

55:37.134 --> 55:38.869
How did he die?

55:38.969 --> 55:40.971
Someone ran him over.

55:41.071 --> 55:42.139
He was in Zurich.

55:42.239 --> 55:44.241
They drive like
maniacs over there.

55:44.341 --> 55:46.076
ELEANOR: Yeah, wow.

55:46.176 --> 55:47.545
He was a concert pianist.

55:47.645 --> 55:49.279
He traveled quite a bit.

55:49.380 --> 55:51.982
He also held a degree
in physics from MIT.

55:52.082 --> 55:53.418
Sounds amazing.

55:53.518 --> 55:56.153
I'm sure he had his
problems, like everyone else.

55:56.253 --> 55:59.189
However, I like to idealize
him into some mythic figure.

55:59.289 --> 56:02.126
It makes me feel better.

56:02.226 --> 56:05.262
I guess he also
drank a great deal.

56:05.362 --> 56:06.464
People will do that.

56:11.135 --> 56:12.637
You hungry?

56:12.737 --> 56:15.305
Come on.

56:15.406 --> 56:18.142
[Bolia singing]

56:19.744 --> 56:20.611
Wow.

56:20.711 --> 56:22.780
I forgot how bad
Bolia's cooking is.

56:27.084 --> 56:28.419
This stuff tastes like gravel.

56:28.519 --> 56:31.155
Want me to ask her to
fix you something else?

56:31.255 --> 56:31.889
Nah.

56:31.989 --> 56:33.123
She's nice.

56:33.223 --> 56:35.693
[Vibrating]

56:37.061 --> 56:39.964
Hey, want to sneak out of
here, go get some Chinese?

56:40.064 --> 56:42.066
There's a great place
in my old neighborhood.

56:42.166 --> 56:43.200
I'll keep her busy.

56:43.300 --> 56:44.902
You dump the stuff
don't the sink.

56:52.376 --> 56:53.243
No, gracias.

56:53.343 --> 56:54.378
We're gonna go for a walk.

56:54.479 --> 56:55.245
[Speaking spanish].

56:55.345 --> 56:56.581
No, gracias.

56:56.681 --> 56:58.449
You can shut down the
kitchen for the night.

56:58.549 --> 56:59.750
[Speaking spanish]?

56:59.850 --> 57:00.818
Si, gracias.

57:00.918 --> 57:01.385
Si.

57:01.486 --> 57:02.487
Gracias, Bolia.

57:02.587 --> 57:03.588
[Speaking spanish]?

57:03.688 --> 57:03.988
Si.

57:19.804 --> 57:23.407
It's crazy to take the subway
when you have a car and driver.

57:23.508 --> 57:24.942
Yeah, well.

57:25.042 --> 57:26.276
Thank you.

57:26.376 --> 57:29.880
Why not let him go
and save the money?

57:29.980 --> 57:31.582
He's a good guy.

57:31.682 --> 57:33.784
Yeah, but he never
drives anyone anywhere.

57:33.884 --> 57:36.554
He practically lives in
the front seat of that car.

57:36.654 --> 57:38.355
Actually, he was
in Crown Heights

57:38.455 --> 57:40.257
With his wife and
seven-year-old daughter,

57:40.357 --> 57:41.892
Who suffers from cerebral palsy.

57:41.992 --> 57:43.994
I've kinda got a
soft spot for him.

57:44.094 --> 57:46.531
Plus he's got my back,
if you know what I mean.

57:46.631 --> 57:47.632
Not really.

57:51.201 --> 57:52.903
What'd I tell you?

57:53.003 --> 57:54.171
Good, huh?

57:54.271 --> 57:55.740
Amazing!

57:55.840 --> 57:58.075
I can feel the MSG in my toes.

57:58.175 --> 57:59.209
Oh, yeah.

[Vibrating]

58:08.285 --> 58:13.558
Another thing about Gerard,
he used to work for John Gotti.

58:13.658 --> 58:14.424
ELEANOR: Who?

58:14.525 --> 58:15.660
Gerard, my driver.

58:15.760 --> 58:16.594
Mm.

58:16.694 --> 58:17.895
He used to be a
soldier for Gotti.

58:17.995 --> 58:19.764
Mm, is that so?

58:19.864 --> 58:21.666
I believe he may
still have some ties

58:21.766 --> 58:24.101
To some of those folks.

58:24.201 --> 58:27.104
I was thinking that he
might be of some assistance.

58:27.204 --> 58:28.405
With what?

58:28.505 --> 58:29.840
Your situation.

58:29.940 --> 58:31.809
I don't follow.

58:31.909 --> 58:34.311
Your situation
with your boyfriend.

58:34.411 --> 58:35.946
Oh my god.

58:36.046 --> 58:38.082
He won't be an issue
in your life after that.

58:38.182 --> 58:39.049
Trust me.

58:39.149 --> 58:40.150
Are you out of your mind?

58:40.250 --> 58:42.787
It used to be his job,
that kind of thing.

58:42.887 --> 58:44.555
Would you just drop
the subject, please?

58:44.655 --> 58:46.356
He could just go and
have a talk with him.

58:46.456 --> 58:48.092
I appreciate the
concern and all.

58:48.192 --> 58:49.359
Just a suggestion.

58:49.459 --> 58:51.061
I told you not to
worry about any of that.

58:51.161 --> 58:53.363
OK, OK.

59:07.111 --> 59:08.412
It's a beautiful day.

59:08.512 --> 59:09.880
Let's go for a walk in the park.

59:09.980 --> 59:13.283
Do you happen to know
who Liu Hoi Sing is?

59:13.383 --> 59:14.852
Why don't you
practice the cello?

59:14.952 --> 59:16.954
You could take it on one
of the balconies and play.

59:17.054 --> 59:20.324
He was the first Chinese
person to settle in New York.

59:20.424 --> 59:21.826
He arrived in 1862.

59:21.926 --> 59:24.094
He married an Irish woman
who bore him two daughters.

59:24.194 --> 59:24.929
Get your cello.

59:25.029 --> 59:26.163
You haven't practiced in weeks.

59:26.263 --> 59:27.431
Ah, I'm done with the cello.

59:27.531 --> 59:29.099
It takes too much out of me.

59:29.199 --> 59:31.435
Don't say that.

59:31.535 --> 59:33.437
I have no interest
in the cello.

59:33.537 --> 59:34.371
All right.

59:34.471 --> 59:35.272
Fine.

59:35.372 --> 59:36.607

park every stinkin' day.

different stinkin' park.

sick of hanging around with me

No.

01:00:01.666 --> 01:00:02.967
Of course not.

I just thought maybe one
of your musician friends.

Are you kidding me?

What?

01:00:06.937 --> 01:00:07.938
They're not my friends.

01:00:08.038 --> 01:00:09.373
I don't have friends like that.

barely speak to me.

Well, I'll bet if you opened
up, they'd really like you.

Perhaps you need to
make more of an effort.

01:00:20.417 --> 01:00:21.786
Well, let's at least call Raj.

01:04:15.585 --> 01:04:16.420
I'll keep you company.

01:04:27.364 --> 01:04:31.201
[Music playing]

01:06:40.630 --> 01:06:41.765
You like M&Ms?

01:06:41.865 --> 01:06:42.766
We got M&Ms.

01:06:42.866 --> 01:06:44.000
He doesn't eat that stuff.

01:06:44.101 --> 01:06:46.470
No, thank you.

01:06:46.570 --> 01:06:47.804
You like Ritz crackers?

01:06:47.904 --> 01:06:49.473
We got Ritz crackers.

01:06:49.573 --> 01:06:50.174
Or beer nuts?

01:06:50.274 --> 01:06:51.608
How about beer nuts.

01:06:51.708 --> 01:06:53.009
No, thank you.

01:06:53.110 --> 01:06:55.079
I can go to Wegman's and
get some stuff tomorrow.

01:06:55.179 --> 01:06:57.481
I'm sure as shit not
going nowhere tonight.

01:06:57.581 --> 01:07:00.150
So what do you like
to do, little boy?

01:07:00.250 --> 01:07:01.551
He likes to read.

01:07:01.651 --> 01:07:03.087
He's very smart.

01:07:03.187 --> 01:07:04.020
What grade you in?

01:07:04.121 --> 01:07:05.222
Fourth, fifth.

01:07:05.322 --> 01:07:06.856
Well, that's
somewhat complicated.

01:07:06.956 --> 01:07:09.226
He's very smart.

01:07:09.326 --> 01:07:11.027
Oh, OK.

01:07:11.128 --> 01:07:13.363
Why don't you take your
coats off and stay a while?

01:07:13.463 --> 01:07:15.031
Because it's freezing in here.

01:07:15.132 --> 01:07:16.566
How about turning on the heat?

01:07:16.666 --> 01:07:18.202
You want to pay my
[inaudible] bill?

01:07:18.302 --> 01:07:19.669
It's summertime,
for crying out loud.

01:07:19.769 --> 01:07:20.704
So?

It's, like, 40 degrees in here.

01:07:24.608 --> 01:07:26.676
So how long you
planning to stay?

01:07:26.776 --> 01:07:28.178
Are you kidding me?

01:07:28.278 --> 01:07:29.546
I just walked in the door.

01:07:29.646 --> 01:07:30.447
All right, everybody.

01:07:33.350 --> 01:07:35.219
I'll go see Dad in the
morning, and then we'll

01:07:35.319 --> 01:07:36.886
Go get back on us.

01:07:36.986 --> 01:07:38.088
How's that?

Don't give a hell
how long you stay.

Stay as long as you want.

hands off the heat.

I'll see Dad,
and then we'll go.

You like meatloaf, little boy?

01:07:57.941 --> 01:07:59.809
I got a big old
meatloaf in the freezer.

01:07:59.909 --> 01:08:00.510
No, thank you.

We can't sleep in this room.

It'll be OK.

01:08:38.715 --> 01:08:41.885
Would you be more comfortable
if we stayed in a hotel?

01:08:41.984 --> 01:08:42.786
Yes.

01:08:42.886 --> 01:08:44.188
But I can't afford that.

01:08:44.287 --> 01:08:46.323
Yes, but would you
be more comfortable?

01:08:53.062 --> 01:08:54.698
I need to borrow your car.

Where the hell you going?

We're going to stay at a hotel.

For chrissake, Eleanor.

I'll bring it back
after the hospital.

What time?

01:09:00.304 --> 01:09:01.438
Where... where you going?

It's 9 o'clock at night.

01:09:02.939 --> 01:09:04.274
What the hell you gonna
do, go driving around town

01:09:04.374 --> 01:09:05.475
With this little kid?

01:09:05.575 --> 01:09:06.710
I don't know if
there's gas in there.

01:09:06.810 --> 01:09:07.911
What hotel do you
think you're going?

01:09:08.011 --> 01:09:08.778
I'll put gas in it.

01:09:08.877 --> 01:09:09.679
That room's a mess.

01:09:09.779 --> 01:09:10.779
We can't sleep in there.

01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:12.115
Well, if we knew what
time you were coming

01:09:12.216 --> 01:09:13.149
And that you were
bringing guests,

01:09:13.250 --> 01:09:14.283
We would have straightened up.

01:09:14.384 --> 01:09:17.654
Can I borrow your car or not?

01:09:17.754 --> 01:09:20.657
I don't know if
there's gas in there.

01:09:20.756 --> 01:09:22.426
I'll bring it back
in the morning.

DALE: You're welcome.

01:09:57.060 --> 01:09:59.896
They have a pool.

01:09:59.996 --> 01:10:01.130
Closed for renovation.

01:10:01.231 --> 01:10:01.731
Oh, well.

So is Dale your mom's brother?

01:10:16.813 --> 01:10:18.615
My dad's.

01:10:18.715 --> 01:10:21.050
They got married when
my parents split up.

01:10:21.150 --> 01:10:22.386
Wow.

01:10:22.486 --> 01:10:24.321
They were all friends
in high school.

01:10:24.421 --> 01:10:28.292
My dad joined the service,
went to fight in the Gulf War.

01:10:28.392 --> 01:10:30.927
Dale was there for her, I guess.

01:10:31.027 --> 01:10:32.462
And then my dad came home.

01:10:32.562 --> 01:10:36.366
He was all messed up and started
doing all this bad stuff,

01:10:36.466 --> 01:10:38.302
So they got divorced,
and Dale moved in.

01:10:45.275 --> 01:10:47.844
I'm tired.

01:10:47.944 --> 01:10:48.512
Go to sleep.

01:10:56.886 --> 01:10:59.623
When I close my eyes, it feels
like I'm still on the bus.

01:11:03.259 --> 01:11:05.795
What made you leave?

01:11:05.895 --> 01:11:07.263
Your whole family's here.

01:11:07.364 --> 01:11:09.499
I think you just answered
your own question.

01:11:16.506 --> 01:11:18.775
I wanted to go to Juilliard.

01:11:18.875 --> 01:11:21.545
To be an actress?

01:11:21.645 --> 01:11:22.145
No.

01:11:22.245 --> 01:11:24.247
God no.

01:11:24.348 --> 01:11:25.315
For music.

01:11:25.415 --> 01:11:27.851
For music?

01:11:27.951 --> 01:11:29.252
Yeah, I play the cornet.

01:11:29.353 --> 01:11:30.954
What?

01:11:31.054 --> 01:11:32.121
The cornet.

01:11:32.221 --> 01:11:35.459
It's like a trumpet
only smaller.

01:11:35.559 --> 01:11:38.127
I know what a cornet is.

01:11:38.227 --> 01:11:40.564
So you're a musician?

01:11:40.664 --> 01:11:41.531
Yep.

01:11:41.631 --> 01:11:43.867
Why didn't you tell me before?

01:11:43.967 --> 01:11:46.436
I didn't not tell you.

01:11:46.536 --> 01:11:48.538
How long have you played?

01:11:48.638 --> 01:11:51.107
Since the fourth grade.

01:11:51.207 --> 01:11:54.110
They did this test to check
everyone's tonal ability,

01:11:54.210 --> 01:11:57.947
And I got a perfect score,
so I got the free rental.

01:11:58.047 --> 01:12:00.216
Wait, free rental?

01:12:00.316 --> 01:12:02.719
That's how you started
playing the cornet?

01:12:02.819 --> 01:12:04.120
Yeah.

01:12:04.220 --> 01:12:06.356
Well, actually I wanted to play
the trumpet, but they were out.

01:12:06.456 --> 01:12:08.458
So they handed me
a cornet, which

01:12:08.558 --> 01:12:10.627
Was fine by me, because
it's easier to play.

01:12:10.727 --> 01:12:13.430
And the case was a lot
lighter to carry around.

01:12:13.530 --> 01:12:14.998
That was lucky.

01:12:15.098 --> 01:12:16.299
Yeah.

01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:19.068
I played in the band
all through high school.

01:12:19.168 --> 01:12:21.104
I loved it.

01:12:21.204 --> 01:12:25.609
I was chosen to play in the
special, like, all-star band

01:12:25.709 --> 01:12:27.677
They put together
for the ceremony

01:12:27.777 --> 01:12:30.580
To open the new war
memorial in Syracuse.

01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:31.881
That sounds like a big deal.

01:12:31.981 --> 01:12:33.883
Hillary Clinton was
there to cut the ribbon.

01:12:33.983 --> 01:12:36.285
I got to play a solo.

01:12:36.386 --> 01:12:39.022
So what happened
with Juilliard?

01:12:39.122 --> 01:12:41.324
They invited me to attend.

01:12:41.425 --> 01:12:42.959
Wow.

01:12:43.059 --> 01:12:44.293
Yeah.

01:12:44.394 --> 01:12:46.262
But they couldn't offer
me a full scholarship,

01:12:46.362 --> 01:12:49.833
So I didn't have enough
money for the tuition.

01:12:49.933 --> 01:12:52.268
That's awful.

01:12:52.368 --> 01:12:53.637
Not really.

01:12:53.737 --> 01:12:56.105
I'm not sure I really
wanted to go there.

01:12:56.205 --> 01:12:58.141
So what did you do then?

01:12:58.241 --> 01:13:02.846
Got a job waiting tables,
started playing in the subway.

01:13:02.946 --> 01:13:04.213
No.

01:13:04.313 --> 01:13:06.450
Yeah.

01:13:06.550 --> 01:13:09.085
I'd play all these,
like, Beatles songs,

01:13:09.185 --> 01:13:11.087
And I made good money.

01:13:11.187 --> 01:13:12.321
That's how I met Dennis.

01:13:12.422 --> 01:13:14.123
In the subway?

01:13:14.223 --> 01:13:15.358
Yeah.

01:13:15.459 --> 01:13:16.493
He saw me, and one
day he just started

01:13:16.593 --> 01:13:18.795
Hanging out there
on the platform.

01:13:18.895 --> 01:13:21.130
The trains would come
and go, and we'd just

01:13:21.230 --> 01:13:23.099
Sit there on the bench.

01:13:23.199 --> 01:13:24.400
Did he give you money?

01:13:24.501 --> 01:13:25.569
Oh, yeah.

01:13:28.672 --> 01:13:31.074
After a while, he started
bringing me coffee and stuff.

01:13:31.174 --> 01:13:34.310
One time he dropped a bag
of Skittles in my case.

01:13:34.410 --> 01:13:37.180
It was cute.

01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:39.248
And then finally
I asked him, you

01:13:39.348 --> 01:13:42.418
Know, hey, you ever
going to say hello?

01:13:42.519 --> 01:13:44.253
What did he say?

01:13:44.353 --> 01:13:46.756
He said he didn't
want to bother me.

01:13:46.856 --> 01:13:49.358
He just loved the
sound of my trumpet.

01:13:49.459 --> 01:13:51.628
What did you say?

01:13:51.728 --> 01:13:55.098
I said, it's not
a trumpet, dummy.

01:13:55.198 --> 01:13:56.199
It happens to be a cornet.

01:13:56.299 --> 01:13:58.334
What did he say?

01:13:58.434 --> 01:14:00.904
I don't remember.

01:14:01.004 --> 01:14:04.040
Then he took me to lunch at
this Korean barbecue place,

01:14:04.140 --> 01:14:06.409
Which I thought was really cool.

01:14:06.510 --> 01:14:09.646
And we started, you
know, hanging out.

01:14:09.746 --> 01:14:12.248
Like boyfriend-girlfriend?

01:14:12.348 --> 01:14:14.918
No, not right away.

01:14:15.018 --> 01:14:16.586
He had a band.

01:14:16.686 --> 01:14:17.654
That was the other thing.

01:14:17.754 --> 01:14:19.989
He asked me to join his band.

01:14:20.089 --> 01:14:21.290
He plays guitar.

01:14:21.390 --> 01:14:23.192
Well, not anymore, since
you threw it out the window.

01:14:23.292 --> 01:14:26.462
Yeah, well, I don't feel
so good about doing that.

01:14:26.563 --> 01:14:29.265
I let my emotions
get the better of me.

01:14:29.365 --> 01:14:32.001
So where's your cornet?

01:14:32.101 --> 01:14:34.470
I don't have it anymore.

01:14:34.571 --> 01:14:37.073
Why not?

01:14:37.173 --> 01:14:39.242
Long story.

01:14:39.342 --> 01:14:41.845
Got in a little
financial situation.

01:14:41.945 --> 01:14:43.980
You sold it?

01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:45.314
Sold it?

01:14:45.414 --> 01:14:48.151
Yeah.

01:14:48.251 --> 01:14:53.022
It was a nice horn too, an Olds.

01:14:53.122 --> 01:14:57.026
My dad bought it for my
high school graduation.

01:14:57.126 --> 01:14:59.462
Total surprise.

01:14:59.563 --> 01:15:00.730
I didn't even know he was there.

01:15:00.830 --> 01:15:02.799
I hadn't seen him for a while.

01:15:07.203 --> 01:15:08.872
And then when I was
leaving the ceremony,

01:15:08.972 --> 01:15:12.542
He was waiting in
the parking lot.

01:15:12.642 --> 01:15:15.278
He was holding this case
with a big red bow around it.

01:15:23.152 --> 01:15:27.090
Well, good night.

01:15:27.190 --> 01:15:28.091
Good night.

01:15:38.501 --> 01:15:41.137
What was the name of that piece
you wrote for the recital?

01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:47.877
"Like Sunday, Like Rain."

01:15:47.977 --> 01:15:51.648
So beautiful.

01:15:51.748 --> 01:15:53.817
I'll write a part for cornet.

01:18:23.733 --> 01:18:24.633
Hey, Shelly.

You dyed your hair.

01:18:33.276 --> 01:18:35.644
So, I heard that you guys
stayed at Days Inn last night.

01:18:35.745 --> 01:18:38.014
I'm sorry the room
was such a mess.

Yeah, you could have
cleaned it up a little bit.

01:18:40.750 --> 01:18:42.118
Yeah, well, that's
kind of hard to do

01:18:42.218 --> 01:18:43.853
When you're working
40 hours a week.

01:18:43.953 --> 01:18:47.056
And what are you doing
working in that place?

01:18:47.156 --> 01:18:49.592
There are plenty of places
besides that to work in.

01:18:49.692 --> 01:18:50.860
You know what?

01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:52.295
It is none of your
business where I work.

01:18:52.395 --> 01:18:54.597
Are you going to cover
my fucking car insurance

01:18:54.697 --> 01:18:57.666
And payments for me?

01:18:57.767 --> 01:18:59.268
Come on.

01:18:59.368 --> 01:19:00.236
Yeah.

01:19:00.336 --> 01:19:02.605
I didn't think so.

01:19:02.705 --> 01:19:03.807
That's right.

01:19:06.509 --> 01:19:09.278
Acting all high and mighty
in front of your friend.

01:19:17.420 --> 01:19:18.587
Where'd you go?

01:19:18.687 --> 01:19:19.622
Don't tell me you
stayed at the Days Inn.

01:19:19.722 --> 01:19:20.890
Mind putting out the cigarette?

01:19:20.990 --> 01:19:22.591
There's a child present.

01:19:22.691 --> 01:19:23.526
Where's Dale?

01:19:23.626 --> 01:19:24.427
Sleeping.

01:19:24.527 --> 01:19:25.294
You like Lucky Charms?

01:19:25.394 --> 01:19:26.429
I got Lucky Charms.

01:19:26.529 --> 01:19:27.196
He's fine.

01:19:27.296 --> 01:19:27.897
No, thank you.

01:19:27.997 --> 01:19:29.432
Here's his lousy keys.

01:19:29.532 --> 01:19:31.334
I'm calling a taxi.

01:19:31.434 --> 01:19:32.836
Where you going now?

01:19:32.936 --> 01:19:34.203
Bus station.

01:19:34.303 --> 01:19:35.438
Bus station?

01:19:35.538 --> 01:19:36.605
Did you see your father?

01:19:36.705 --> 01:19:38.107
I thought that's
what you came to do.

01:19:38.207 --> 01:19:38.674
Yeah.

01:19:38.774 --> 01:19:39.442
Yeah, I saw him.

01:19:39.542 --> 01:19:40.276
How about you?

01:19:40.376 --> 01:19:41.577
Have you seen him?

01:19:41.677 --> 01:19:42.678
Has anyone here bothered to
go down there and see him?

01:19:42.778 --> 01:19:44.213
Keep your voice down.

01:19:44.313 --> 01:19:45.815
You have had a bug up your
ass since you showed up here.

01:19:45.915 --> 01:19:46.715
What's the matter?

01:19:46.816 --> 01:19:47.616
Yeah, I'd like a taxi.

01:19:47.716 --> 01:19:49.718
59 Pennwick Street.

01:19:49.819 --> 01:19:50.753
Yeah, to the bus station.

01:19:50.854 --> 01:19:52.055
Thanks.

01:19:52.155 --> 01:19:53.356
What the hell is all
this noise going on?

01:19:53.456 --> 01:19:54.723
He's on life support, Dale.

01:19:54.824 --> 01:19:55.992
Yeah, I know that.

01:19:56.092 --> 01:19:57.160
They said that they've
been calling you,

01:19:57.260 --> 01:19:58.694
And you never called him back.

01:19:58.794 --> 01:20:00.529
Do you know what his
veteran benefits cover?

01:20:00.629 --> 01:20:01.865
Not very much.

01:20:01.965 --> 01:20:03.066
That's the reason they
have been calling here.

01:20:03.166 --> 01:20:05.034
I... I just don't
understand why.

01:20:05.134 --> 01:20:08.204
Would it have been so hard
for you to go down there

01:20:08.304 --> 01:20:09.405
And sit with him?

01:20:09.505 --> 01:20:10.840
He's your brother.

01:20:10.940 --> 01:20:12.241
He was all alone.

01:20:12.341 --> 01:20:14.010
Hey, I didn't see
you nowhere when

01:20:14.110 --> 01:20:17.780
Things started getting bad, so
don't go giving me no lectures.

01:20:17.881 --> 01:20:19.015
We'll wait on the corner.

01:20:19.115 --> 01:20:21.150
MOM: Come back in
the house, Eleanor.

01:20:21.250 --> 01:20:22.085
Go to hell!

01:20:26.589 --> 01:20:27.690
Hey, Eleanor.

01:20:27.790 --> 01:20:28.925
Take it easy, will you?

01:20:29.025 --> 01:20:30.960
I'm never coming
back here again.

01:20:31.060 --> 01:20:33.562
DALE: Just come back inside.

01:20:33.662 --> 01:20:34.697
Eleanor.

01:20:34.797 --> 01:20:36.866
Eleanor!

01:20:36.966 --> 01:20:41.070
[Music playing]

01:21:23.212 --> 01:21:24.080
Sorry.

01:21:24.180 --> 01:21:25.514
That's all they
had in the station.

01:21:25.614 --> 01:21:26.515
This is fine.

01:21:26.615 --> 01:21:27.116
Thanks.

01:21:33.189 --> 01:21:33.489
Good.

01:21:37.961 --> 01:21:40.663
Are you really never
going back there?

01:21:40.763 --> 01:21:41.564
Where?

01:21:41.664 --> 01:21:42.966
Home.

01:21:43.066 --> 01:21:45.634
You said that you were
never gonna go back there.

01:21:45.734 --> 01:21:47.370
Who knows?

01:21:47.470 --> 01:21:51.407
Probably someday, to see my
brother if he ever comes back.

01:21:51.507 --> 01:21:54.110
And you know, I worry
about my sister,

01:21:54.210 --> 01:21:56.145
Though sometimes I
want to strangle her.

01:21:56.245 --> 01:21:59.248
She could come see
you in New York.

01:21:59.348 --> 01:21:59.615
Sure.

01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:07.356
I think actually I'm
gonna head out West.

01:22:07.456 --> 01:22:08.757
Out West?

01:22:08.857 --> 01:22:11.794
This friend of mine lives in
Idaho, works at a ski resort,

01:22:11.894 --> 01:22:14.230
Makes pretty good money.

01:22:14.330 --> 01:22:16.865
She's always telling me she
could hook me up with a job

01:22:16.966 --> 01:22:17.633
There.

01:22:17.733 --> 01:22:18.934
Sounds cold.

01:22:19.035 --> 01:22:20.869
It's really pretty.

01:22:20.970 --> 01:22:21.870
I've seen pictures.

01:22:21.971 --> 01:22:23.072
It's not cold all the time.

01:22:27.310 --> 01:22:30.746
So that's what you're gonna do?

01:22:30.846 --> 01:22:33.116
Yeah, I think so.

01:22:33.216 --> 01:22:34.683
What about the cornet?

01:22:34.783 --> 01:22:36.052
What about it?

01:22:36.152 --> 01:22:37.653
I'll come back to it someday.

01:22:37.753 --> 01:22:39.255
You have to.

01:22:39.355 --> 01:22:41.690
Why don't you read your book?

01:22:41.790 --> 01:22:43.092
Finished it.

01:22:43.192 --> 01:22:45.261
"Grapes of Wrath," there's
a happy story for you.

01:22:49.832 --> 01:22:54.303
You have a gift, and you have an
obligation to take care of it.

01:22:54.403 --> 01:22:55.904
What are you talking about?

01:22:56.005 --> 01:22:57.906
For all you know, I
could be the worst cornet

01:22:58.007 --> 01:22:58.974
Player in the whole world.

01:22:59.075 --> 01:23:00.243
I don't think so.

01:23:00.343 --> 01:23:01.910
I don't think you
would have been chosen

01:23:02.011 --> 01:23:04.680
For that all-star band
if that were the case.

01:23:04.780 --> 01:23:08.151
You certainly wouldn't
have gotten into Juilliard.

01:23:08.251 --> 01:23:10.453
It's a crime to deprive
the world of your art.

01:23:10.553 --> 01:23:12.121
I thought you
said art was dead.

01:23:12.221 --> 01:23:13.556
Yes, and it will
remain that way

01:23:13.656 --> 01:23:16.492
If all the great artists
abandon their cornets

01:23:16.592 --> 01:23:17.493
And move to Idaho.

01:23:20.363 --> 01:23:23.266
Just promise me you'll
come back to it.

01:23:23.366 --> 01:23:28.437
Promise me you'll come
back to your music.

01:23:28.537 --> 01:23:30.839
I will if you will.

01:23:30.939 --> 01:23:31.440
Deal.

01:24:31.767 --> 01:24:33.035
I dozed off.

01:24:33.136 --> 01:24:36.038
You breathe so
deeply when you sleep.

01:24:36.139 --> 01:24:40.209
I was dreaming.

01:24:40.309 --> 01:24:42.077
I was at this lake
that we used to go

01:24:42.178 --> 01:24:44.747
To when I was a little girl.

01:24:44.847 --> 01:24:46.749
Dennis was there.

01:24:46.849 --> 01:24:49.785
Did you love him?

01:24:49.885 --> 01:24:51.487
I guess so.

01:24:51.587 --> 01:24:53.589
I thought I did.

01:24:53.689 --> 01:24:54.890
Did he love you?

01:24:58.194 --> 01:24:59.662
He said he did.

01:24:59.762 --> 01:25:03.832
He told me he did, but
you know, who knows?

01:25:03.932 --> 01:25:07.636
First he was nice, and then
he started treating me bad

01:25:07.736 --> 01:25:13.709
And lying and stuff, so I
guess you never really know.

01:25:13.809 --> 01:25:18.814
Do you think you're ever going
to get married, have kids?

01:25:18.914 --> 01:25:19.848
So many questions.

01:25:19.948 --> 01:25:20.683
Sorry.

01:25:20.783 --> 01:25:21.817
I'm just curious.

01:25:24.853 --> 01:25:27.223
I don't think so.

01:25:27.323 --> 01:25:30.025
I don't think that stuff is
all it's cracked up to be.

01:25:30.125 --> 01:25:31.594
I've never seen it work.

01:25:31.694 --> 01:25:33.296
I would disagree.

01:25:33.396 --> 01:25:34.997
Who's all sentimental?

01:25:35.097 --> 01:25:37.132
It does work.

01:25:37.233 --> 01:25:41.304
If you belong together with
someone, then it works.

01:25:41.404 --> 01:25:43.206
The trouble is
finding someone you

01:25:43.306 --> 01:25:46.875
Belong with who
belongs with you.

01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:55.751
Do you think you'll
ever see him again?

01:25:55.851 --> 01:25:57.019
No.

01:25:57.119 --> 01:25:58.554
If someone doesn't
treat you the way

01:25:58.654 --> 01:26:02.425
You deserve, then they
don't deserve to have you.

01:26:02.525 --> 01:26:04.893
My dad always told me that.

01:26:04.993 --> 01:26:06.962
Will I?

01:26:07.062 --> 01:26:07.996
Will you what?

01:26:08.096 --> 01:26:09.998
See you.

01:26:10.098 --> 01:26:11.099
I'm right here.

01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:12.935
After you go, I mean.

01:26:13.035 --> 01:26:14.537
You're going, right?

01:26:18.040 --> 01:26:21.910
So, will I ever see you again?

01:26:22.010 --> 01:26:23.246
If you want to.

01:26:25.748 --> 01:26:30.353
We could send letters
and stuff, keep in touch.

01:26:30.453 --> 01:26:33.021
Something tells me a year from
now you won't remember my name.

01:26:33.121 --> 01:26:34.223
That's not true.

01:26:44.467 --> 01:26:46.869
I wonder if anyone
will ever love me.

01:26:50.239 --> 01:26:52.308
I think the odds
are pretty good.

01:27:02.685 --> 01:27:05.521
[Doorbell]

01:27:18.267 --> 01:27:19.668
So, how old is he?

01:27:19.768 --> 01:27:20.703
Oh, he's 12.

01:27:20.803 --> 01:27:21.804
He's really great.

01:27:21.904 --> 01:27:25.040
You'll love him.

01:27:25.140 --> 01:27:26.975
Hey, Reg.

01:27:27.075 --> 01:27:27.743
Come meet Karina.

01:27:30.813 --> 01:27:31.714
Hi, Reggie.

01:27:31.814 --> 01:27:32.948
Nice to meet you.

01:27:33.048 --> 01:27:34.683
You have a beautiful home.

01:27:34.783 --> 01:27:35.818
Thank you.

01:27:35.918 --> 01:27:39.187
It was built by Captain
Francis Falk in 1898.

01:27:39.288 --> 01:27:42.358
He also designed the
Museum of Natural History.

01:27:42.458 --> 01:27:44.126
KARINA: Oh, that's
so interesting.

01:27:44.226 --> 01:27:45.160
Not really.

01:27:45.260 --> 01:27:47.396
He designed lots of buildings.

01:27:47.496 --> 01:27:50.899
Come and help me
show her around.

01:27:50.999 --> 01:27:52.200
No, thank you.

01:27:52.301 --> 01:27:53.569
I'm going to go back
in my room and finish

01:27:53.669 --> 01:27:56.972
Reading this biography
of Groucho Marx.

01:27:57.072 --> 01:27:58.073
It was nice to meet you.

01:27:58.173 --> 01:28:00.008
KARINA: Nice to meet you too.

01:29:04.272 --> 01:29:06.375
[Knocking]

01:29:07.843 --> 01:29:08.911
Good morning.

01:29:09.011 --> 01:29:12.014
Dark roast French press,
just like you like it.

01:29:12.114 --> 01:29:14.550
ELEANOR: Awesome.

01:29:14.650 --> 01:29:16.084
I hope you're hungry.

01:29:16.184 --> 01:29:19.455
I made a vegetable frittata
and some flourless pancakes.

01:29:19.555 --> 01:29:20.155
Come on down.

01:29:50.185 --> 01:29:52.488
More coffee?

01:29:52.588 --> 01:29:54.222
No, thank you.

01:29:54.322 --> 01:29:55.023
This is delicious.

01:30:03.331 --> 01:30:08.003
Esa will be here
tomorrow at 8:00 AM.

01:30:08.103 --> 01:30:11.707
So Karina's going to
make your dinner tonight.

01:30:11.807 --> 01:30:14.510
And lunch.

01:30:14.610 --> 01:30:15.711
I can feed myself.

01:30:25.220 --> 01:30:26.254
Don't forget your vitamins.

01:30:26.354 --> 01:30:27.823
Why do you have to go?

01:30:35.564 --> 01:30:38.000
[Doorbell]

01:30:43.005 --> 01:30:43.639
Must be Karina.

01:31:19.742 --> 01:31:21.644
She's just getting
herself unpacked.

01:31:21.744 --> 01:31:26.615
Do you want to go for
a walk or something?

01:31:26.715 --> 01:31:28.851
I think I should
probably get going.

01:31:28.951 --> 01:31:29.251
Right.

01:31:37.059 --> 01:31:38.493
This is for you.

01:31:38.594 --> 01:31:40.095
What is it?

01:31:40.195 --> 01:31:43.231
I made some penne with fresh
pesto and some of that crispy

01:31:43.331 --> 01:31:47.335
Kale you like for your trip.

01:31:47.435 --> 01:31:48.537
Thanks, Reg.

01:31:57.012 --> 01:31:59.281
Oh, well.

01:31:59.381 --> 01:32:02.217
Yep.

01:32:02.317 --> 01:32:04.152
Karina's very nice.

01:32:04.252 --> 01:32:04.920
Yeah.

01:32:05.020 --> 01:32:05.688
She seems great.

01:32:09.658 --> 01:32:12.761
She likes to play
chess, she told me.

01:32:12.861 --> 01:32:13.161
Cool.

01:32:16.064 --> 01:32:19.434
Um, your mom's
back on the 27th,

01:32:19.534 --> 01:32:22.504
And she's going to
call you tonight.

01:32:22.605 --> 01:32:24.339
Esa's back tomorrow
morning, so...

01:32:24.439 --> 01:32:25.307
I know.

01:32:25.407 --> 01:32:26.274
Don't worry.

01:32:30.278 --> 01:32:33.515
Straight on to Idaho, then.

01:32:33.616 --> 01:32:37.820
I'm not too sure
about that right now.

01:32:37.920 --> 01:32:42.357
I think I need to go home
for a while, regroup.

01:32:42.457 --> 01:32:46.328
You know, gather myself.

01:32:46.428 --> 01:32:49.431
Sometimes that's
the best thing.

01:32:49.531 --> 01:32:50.999
Regroup, take stock.

01:32:56.839 --> 01:33:00.275
It's been really nice
getting to know you.

01:33:00.375 --> 01:33:00.876
You too.

01:33:03.545 --> 01:33:05.881
It's hard to believe it's
only been a couple of months.

01:33:05.981 --> 01:33:10.052
I feel like I've known you...

01:33:11.453 --> 01:33:14.690
I have all these
words, these things

01:33:14.790 --> 01:33:20.428
And... that I think I feel
the need to say to you.

01:33:20.528 --> 01:33:25.267
Only now, suddenly I don't
have the capacity to speak.

01:33:28.671 --> 01:33:32.708
I couldn't have stayed
forever, you know.

01:33:32.808 --> 01:33:35.010
It was only supposed to
be a temporary thing.

01:33:39.514 --> 01:33:42.384
It's OK.

01:33:42.484 --> 01:33:46.354
[Music playing]

01:34:25.694 --> 01:34:26.795
Be a good boy.
