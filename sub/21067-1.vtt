WEBVTT

01:58.218 --> 01:59.418
Thanks for coming in, Jack.

02:00.687 --> 02:01.720
How you feeling?

02:04.925 --> 02:07.392
Yeah, stupid question
I guess, all right, look.

02:09.596 --> 02:11.897
What you're going through
is unimaginable,

02:11.932 --> 02:13.932
but you're gonna have
to let me in a little bit

02:13.967 --> 02:15.567
so I can do my job, all right?

02:18.738 --> 02:19.838
Yeah.

02:20.473 --> 02:21.507
Good.

03:39.019 --> 03:40.719
Will you go on a date with me?

03:41.921 --> 03:43.989
Hmm.

03:44.024 --> 03:46.225
Why do you think I should
go on a date with you?

04:00.006 --> 04:01.807
I think I'll erase that.

04:03.543 --> 04:04.910
Once the Assyrians,

04:05.712 --> 04:06.912
not the Persians...

05:31.798 --> 05:32.964
Hey, mom.

05:33.533 --> 05:34.733
Hey, baby.

05:50.583 --> 05:51.683
How was school?

05:52.519 --> 05:53.585
"School."

05:54.154 --> 05:55.453
Huh?

05:55.488 --> 05:56.488
It's good.

06:12.439 --> 06:13.505
Are you sure?

06:15.175 --> 06:18.577
Yeah, I mean I guess they'll
have to meet eventually.

06:19.446 --> 06:20.812
Okay.

06:20.847 --> 06:22.047
I'll tell Jack.

06:23.116 --> 06:24.883
Okay. Bye.

06:33.993 --> 06:34.993
Jack.

06:35.495 --> 06:37.162
Yeah.

06:37.197 --> 06:40.532
How'd you like to go
out to dinner tonight?

06:41.634 --> 06:42.734
Sounds great.

06:43.236 --> 06:44.803
Remember that guy,

06:44.838 --> 06:46.104
I've been telling you about?

06:46.139 --> 06:47.806
The guy from work.

06:47.841 --> 06:48.940
The bouncer?

06:50.043 --> 06:51.943
No, he is a security officer.

06:57.517 --> 06:58.617
He has...

06:59.552 --> 07:00.986
He has a son about your age.

07:02.188 --> 07:03.188
And, uh...

07:04.891 --> 07:06.591
And they're gonna come
pick us up at 6:30.

07:07.126 --> 07:08.160
Cool.

07:11.030 --> 07:13.097
And honey,

07:13.132 --> 07:15.000
just don't call him
a bouncer, okay?

07:16.069 --> 07:17.469
Okay.

07:17.504 --> 07:18.537
Would you look at me?

07:20.273 --> 07:21.907
He is a security officer.

07:22.976 --> 07:24.609
I got it.

07:24.644 --> 07:25.844
You better

07:32.018 --> 07:36.020
oh, and could you wear the
brown shirt with the buttons?

07:36.055 --> 07:37.222
Yes, I can.

07:38.191 --> 07:39.491
Thank you.

08:04.817 --> 08:06.084
Hey.

08:06.119 --> 08:08.220
Hey, gorgeous.
How are you?

08:08.988 --> 08:10.055
Good. I am good.

08:11.624 --> 08:12.757
This is my son.

08:13.626 --> 08:15.527
Hey, Jack. Tom.

08:15.562 --> 08:17.242
Nice to meet you.
Nice to finally meet you.

08:17.697 --> 08:18.763
That's my...

08:19.632 --> 08:20.899
Mark, come on out.

08:30.043 --> 08:32.143
My son mark.
She is Karen.

08:32.178 --> 08:34.111
Hey. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

08:34.147 --> 08:36.114
He's starting capital high
this week.

08:36.149 --> 08:37.849
Maybe you two should hang out.

08:37.884 --> 08:38.950
Yeah, sure.

08:38.985 --> 08:40.118
Yeah.

08:40.153 --> 08:41.219
Nice to meet you.

08:41.721 --> 08:42.821
Yeah.

08:43.856 --> 08:45.990
My tummy is rumbling.
Hungry?

08:46.025 --> 08:47.258
Yes.
I got the place.

08:47.293 --> 08:50.795
What? Great.
Avenue. Come on, lets go.

08:53.866 --> 08:55.634
Capital high. You like it?

08:56.302 --> 08:57.602
It's all right.

08:57.637 --> 08:58.770
He hates it.

08:59.939 --> 09:01.573
Yeah, I heard it sucks.

09:01.608 --> 09:02.741
Where'd you hear from?

09:03.710 --> 09:05.110
I don't know, I just heard it.

09:08.147 --> 09:10.615
So, what's your
favorite subject?

09:12.251 --> 09:13.251
Chinese.

09:14.621 --> 09:15.787
They have Chinese?

09:15.822 --> 09:16.854
Yeah.

09:16.889 --> 09:18.129
It is taught by real China man?

09:19.058 --> 09:20.659
I mean she is from Philly...

09:22.829 --> 09:24.996
Do you play anything, Jack?

09:25.031 --> 09:27.232
I've never been
really good at music.

09:29.035 --> 09:30.168
I play guitar,

09:31.304 --> 09:32.837
should learn drums.
I could teach you.

09:34.407 --> 09:35.807
Yeah, that'll be really cool.

09:37.644 --> 09:38.843
Maybe start a band.

09:44.117 --> 09:46.217
Yeah, I think I saw an
asteroids machine out back,

09:46.252 --> 09:47.586
you wanna go play?

09:48.921 --> 09:50.888
Yeah, that's a great idea.

09:50.923 --> 09:52.957
Let me give you some...
Got a couple...

09:52.992 --> 09:54.637
Mark has the money.
You just keep the change.

09:54.661 --> 09:56.021
You have money on you, right?
Yeah.

10:04.137 --> 10:05.777
This is going well, don't you think?
Yeah.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.248
So, the asteroids are outside?

10:18.117 --> 10:20.785
No.

10:20.820 --> 10:23.254
Ah, man, I just couldn't fucking
handle that shit any more.

10:24.023 --> 10:25.190
Yeah, I feel that.

10:27.427 --> 10:28.760
You smoke?

10:29.328 --> 10:30.328
Yeah.

10:30.797 --> 10:31.797
Cool.

10:34.067 --> 10:35.787
Aren't they gonna be able
to smell it on us?

10:37.103 --> 10:39.871
They wouldn't notice if you
smoked it right in front of them.

10:39.906 --> 10:40.972
They're in love, man.

10:42.942 --> 10:43.942
Here.

10:45.244 --> 10:46.244
Thanks.

10:49.282 --> 10:50.649
So, where you from?

10:52.985 --> 10:54.019
Here.

10:55.321 --> 10:57.789
Yeah. I just moved here.

11:01.160 --> 11:02.327
Where were you before?

11:03.996 --> 11:06.197
All over. You know
we moved around a lot.

11:08.968 --> 11:11.202
Why you just coming
to school now?

11:11.237 --> 11:13.672
I don't know.
Paperwork, I guess.

11:14.774 --> 11:15.840
Cool.

11:22.949 --> 11:23.982
Stay right there.

11:26.385 --> 11:28.720
Some room over here for me?

11:28.755 --> 11:30.321
Yeah, I think
I can squeeze you in.

11:30.356 --> 11:31.356
You sure?
Mmm, yeah.

11:33.993 --> 11:35.093
You're alright.

11:42.034 --> 11:43.134
You want anymore?

11:44.403 --> 11:46.871
No, man, I am fucking
high already.

11:53.012 --> 11:54.245
Fuck it.

11:54.280 --> 11:55.413
You wanna go back in?

11:57.150 --> 11:58.183
Okay.

11:59.852 --> 12:01.953
You stoned?

12:01.988 --> 12:04.989
So, are you just some kinda
Holden Caufield suburban tragedy?

12:05.024 --> 12:06.190
I fucking hate that book.

12:06.225 --> 12:07.859
Yeah, you will.

12:07.894 --> 12:09.093
Oh, fuck.

12:09.128 --> 12:11.896
Hey, Jesus, hey,
we're right here.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.180
Do you have to do
that in public?

12:16.435 --> 12:18.169
We probably have 20
minutes until we left.

12:18.204 --> 12:19.837
Well, we ran out of quarters.

12:19.872 --> 12:21.306
Yeah, he sucks at asteroids.

12:25.211 --> 12:26.844
Can I get you guys
a dessert menu?

12:26.879 --> 12:27.879
Yeah.

12:29.816 --> 12:31.316
So you guys clicked immediately?

12:32.084 --> 12:33.084
Yeah.

12:35.388 --> 12:37.388
We were into a lot
of the same stuff.

12:37.423 --> 12:38.523
Like what?

12:41.994 --> 12:43.895
Like music and stuff.

12:43.930 --> 12:45.063
What's your favorite band?

12:46.199 --> 12:47.599
I don't really
have a favorite band.

12:50.036 --> 12:51.102
But I mean I...

12:52.138 --> 12:53.471
We listen to a lot of like...

12:53.506 --> 12:55.807
Nirvana and GG Allin.

12:57.009 --> 12:58.876
Stuff like that.

12:58.911 --> 13:00.522
I got to tell you
I never really understood

13:00.546 --> 13:03.114
the allure of those bands,
they just seem so angry to me.

13:04.083 --> 13:05.216
Well, who isn't?

13:06.352 --> 13:08.419
Would you
consider yourself angry?

13:11.157 --> 13:13.258
No, I mean what bands
aren't angry.

13:14.460 --> 13:16.961
Well...
Fleetwood Mac.

13:19.131 --> 13:22.467
No, okay, I know, I know
I am dinosaur.

14:02.041 --> 14:03.507
Hello, Jack.

14:03.542 --> 14:04.542
What's going on?

14:05.244 --> 14:06.277
Nothing.

14:07.413 --> 14:08.646
You wanna go to your room?

14:08.681 --> 14:10.147
It's right here.

14:10.182 --> 14:11.449
Yo, we're gonna...

14:11.484 --> 14:12.884
Yeah, sure, okay, great.

14:12.919 --> 14:14.252
Okay. See ya.
Be good.

14:18.557 --> 14:19.624
Yeah, this is it.

14:24.130 --> 14:25.230
Cool, man.

14:26.165 --> 14:27.465
Sweet record player.

14:27.500 --> 14:29.433
Fucking Melvins.
Love that band.

14:29.468 --> 14:31.069
That's my favorite.
Yeah?

14:31.304 --> 14:32.337
Yeah.

14:37.209 --> 14:38.243
I dig the wallpaper.

14:38.711 --> 14:39.944
Thanks.

14:41.180 --> 14:42.347
Do you mind if I...

14:43.282 --> 14:45.416
Check out your records?

14:45.451 --> 14:46.584
Oh, yeah, totally, cool.

14:52.491 --> 14:54.459
<i>Screaming trees, rising.</i>

14:55.394 --> 14:57.395
Oh,<i> mud honey.</i> Nice.

14:57.430 --> 14:59.230
Yeah.
Man, you got sweet taste,

14:59.265 --> 15:00.999
you should
definitely learn drums.

15:02.268 --> 15:03.301
Thanks, man.

15:14.246 --> 15:15.446
I got you a present.

15:21.387 --> 15:22.520
Yeah, sure.

16:16.108 --> 16:17.908
I get a check every
month from the government.

16:19.145 --> 16:20.211
Besides that,

16:21.547 --> 16:22.680
I have some...

16:23.682 --> 16:24.716
Security gigs.

16:30.056 --> 16:32.390
Tom, what I am
basically trying...

16:32.425 --> 16:35.393
To understand here
is the relationship

16:35.428 --> 16:37.795
between your son and Jack.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.731
Uh-huh? Can you tell me a
little bit about that?

16:43.302 --> 16:45.136
Don't know what
there is to tell.

17:09.395 --> 17:10.494
Eat up. C'mon, let's go.

17:15.233 --> 17:16.434
I like your shirt, mark.

17:17.603 --> 17:19.770
Really? Me too.

17:19.805 --> 17:21.638
You were supposed
to burn it, right?

17:22.875 --> 17:24.708
Yes, sir. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Burn it. Yeah.

17:24.742 --> 17:26.044
Yeah.

17:27.445 --> 17:28.546
He doesn't hate everyone.

17:29.381 --> 17:30.581
Just me.

17:36.388 --> 17:37.588
Jack, you ready?

17:37.623 --> 17:38.823
Yeah.

17:38.858 --> 17:40.091
Let's roll in.

17:41.360 --> 17:42.827
Thank you.
You're welcome.

17:42.862 --> 17:44.228
Thanks, Karen.

17:48.300 --> 17:49.500
Gross.

17:53.172 --> 17:54.305
Uh-uh.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.607
I love you.

17:56.642 --> 17:58.209
I love you.
Have a good day.

17:58.244 --> 17:59.244
Yeah.

18:45.424 --> 18:46.557
It's fucking great, man.

18:48.727 --> 18:52.229
So, yeah, so, basically
like what you want to know,

18:52.264 --> 18:54.899
pretty much any fucking tune,
any rock beat, right,

18:54.934 --> 18:59.203
it's all four-four which basically
means your counting in four, right?

18:59.238 --> 19:01.906
So that'll be like one, two, three,
four, and just speed that up.

19:02.841 --> 19:04.542
You got like...

19:08.781 --> 19:09.781
Mark.

19:10.983 --> 19:13.584
Mark.
What?

19:13.619 --> 19:15.953
Don't look but I think
those guys are staring at us.

19:15.988 --> 19:17.588
What guys?
I just said don't look.

19:20.593 --> 19:21.692
Those guys?

19:21.727 --> 19:23.261
Yeah.
You know those guys?

19:23.896 --> 19:25.296
Not really.

19:30.736 --> 19:32.570
Hey.

19:32.605 --> 19:34.705
They're looking at us
or they looking at you?

19:34.740 --> 19:36.240
Yeah, I think that'd be us.

19:37.376 --> 19:38.576
Maybe they don't like Satan.

19:44.583 --> 19:45.683
They're coming over.

19:46.919 --> 19:48.386
Alright...
Hey!

19:56.662 --> 19:57.862
Let's get the fuck outta here.

20:02.801 --> 20:04.702
What the fuck
was that about, huh?

20:04.737 --> 20:06.604
I mean, it's just like...

20:06.639 --> 20:09.373
You know if anything makes them
question their fucking stupid lives,

20:09.408 --> 20:11.642
they just wanna fucking
punch it in the dick.

20:11.677 --> 20:13.510
And the worst part,
is that we live in a place

20:13.545 --> 20:14.823
right, that doesn't give a shit.

20:14.847 --> 20:17.615
It actually encourages their
meat head bullshit, you know.

20:17.650 --> 20:18.549
You know what I mean,

20:18.585 --> 20:20.484
and you know it without
a doubt, right?

20:20.519 --> 20:22.879
That asshole's daddy is just
fucking winging on his mommy...

20:23.055 --> 20:24.622
It's a cute story.

20:24.657 --> 20:25.977
Why don't you
tell me how it ends?

20:26.959 --> 20:28.259
I don't know.

20:29.662 --> 20:31.395
You have to let me know.

20:31.430 --> 20:32.630
Aw, I have to let him know.

21:03.028 --> 21:04.995
What the fuck are you doing?

21:05.030 --> 21:06.597
I'll call the cops.

21:08.600 --> 21:09.734
Hey, let's go.

21:16.842 --> 21:18.609
What do you mean?

21:18.644 --> 21:22.379
Well, I mean this
in the best way possible,

21:22.414 --> 21:24.949
but you just don't seem
to be their type.

21:26.819 --> 21:29.620
I mean you're good at school,
your family life seems...

21:29.655 --> 21:31.021
Pretty together and supportive

21:31.056 --> 21:32.723
unless there's something
I am not seeing.

21:34.493 --> 21:35.993
No, I mean my home life is good,

21:36.028 --> 21:37.394
I am good at school,

21:37.429 --> 21:39.496
but I don't really see
what that changes.

21:39.531 --> 21:40.964
It doesn't change anything.

21:40.999 --> 21:42.066
It's just that...

21:43.836 --> 21:45.936
You don't seem to kind
of fit into their profile.

21:45.971 --> 21:47.705
You know what I mean?

21:47.740 --> 21:50.708
I mean you're a good smart kid.

21:53.912 --> 21:56.647
They're smart. Really smart.

21:58.550 --> 22:00.818
And really kind.

22:02.821 --> 22:04.488
I mean that's why I liked them.

23:21.533 --> 23:24.402
When we were in there I swear I can
feel your nipples getting hard.

23:26.472 --> 23:27.905
Did you give her tongue?

23:27.940 --> 23:29.407
Dude, what do you
think I am rookie?

23:29.908 --> 23:31.608
She's there.

23:31.643 --> 23:33.777
You alright man?
You seem very...

23:33.812 --> 23:35.546
Just nervous about the test.

23:36.148 --> 23:37.214
Hey.

23:37.249 --> 23:39.116
What room are you in?

23:39.151 --> 23:40.984
- 216.
- "216."

23:41.019 --> 23:42.820
Sorry, why the fuck
are you taking it?

23:42.855 --> 23:44.955
I don't know my parents want
me like, to practice...

23:44.990 --> 23:46.824
You don't have
to take these for another year.

23:46.859 --> 23:48.025
What room are you in though?

23:48.060 --> 23:49.026
205.

23:49.061 --> 23:51.095
Fuck, you guys are both
in the second floor.

23:51.830 --> 23:52.963
Yeah.

23:52.998 --> 23:55.098
So I can't cheat off
either of you. No.

23:55.133 --> 23:56.434
Good luck.
Alright.

23:57.569 --> 23:59.136
Thank you. You too.

23:59.171 --> 24:00.171
Yeah.

24:01.673 --> 24:02.773
Gonna be okay.

24:02.808 --> 24:04.441
Yeah.

24:04.477 --> 24:07.711
You just have to take these papers and
then head over to your assigned class.

24:12.084 --> 24:13.517
Name?

24:13.552 --> 24:14.918
Stevson.

24:14.953 --> 24:16.587
Okay, give me one second.

24:17.189 --> 24:18.622
Jack, Jack.

24:18.657 --> 24:20.624
You got my calculator
in your bag, right?

24:25.030 --> 24:26.163
Come on, man.

24:28.634 --> 24:29.911
Yeah, actually
it's in my locker.

24:29.935 --> 24:31.502
We'll be right back.

24:44.149 --> 24:45.916
I see a fish.

24:45.951 --> 24:47.985
It's swimming.
It's swimming.

24:48.020 --> 24:49.153
Swimming.

24:50.756 --> 24:51.889
I see a dick.

24:53.225 --> 24:55.693
A big gross weird dick.

24:56.628 --> 24:57.794
Oh, my god.

24:57.829 --> 24:59.663
Look, look, look.

24:59.698 --> 25:01.732
Oh, yeah.
See that?

25:01.767 --> 25:03.800
Yeah, that's weird.

25:03.835 --> 25:06.870
Balls right there and you
got the skeleton

25:06.905 --> 25:10.207
is... in a big head.

25:10.242 --> 25:11.642
So gross.

25:12.878 --> 25:14.111
I see tits.

25:17.049 --> 25:18.081
Cloudy tits.

25:18.116 --> 25:19.216
"Cloudy tits."

25:22.754 --> 25:23.921
Full moon.

25:38.937 --> 25:40.004
No.

25:41.006 --> 25:43.340
Not that I can think of.

25:43.375 --> 25:45.876
What about music, video games?

25:46.645 --> 25:48.178
But they're kids.

25:48.213 --> 25:50.581
All of their music
sounds violent to me.

25:52.985 --> 25:54.318
Not in an unhealthy way.

25:56.355 --> 25:59.022
Did they ever
show any interest...

25:59.057 --> 26:01.926
In firearms, knives,
that kind of thing?

26:12.170 --> 26:13.804
Okay.

26:13.839 --> 26:15.850
Alright, now, what is the first
thing we need to remember

26:15.874 --> 26:17.941
before we start?

26:17.976 --> 26:19.676
I don't know,
don't shoot each other?

26:19.711 --> 26:21.178
Funny. Put those up.

26:22.648 --> 26:24.114
Alright. Let's see here.

26:24.149 --> 26:25.182
Jack.

26:26.184 --> 26:28.685
This one, here,

26:28.720 --> 26:30.153
don't point at anything
or anybody

26:30.188 --> 26:31.733
unless you wanna kill
them, you understand?

26:31.757 --> 26:32.967
Mmm-hmm.
Point it to the ground.

26:32.991 --> 26:34.135
You don't want to kill me,
do you?

26:34.159 --> 26:35.225
No.

26:35.260 --> 26:36.360
I didn't think so.

26:36.395 --> 26:37.695
Listen.

26:39.364 --> 26:41.198
Marks in line.

26:42.868 --> 26:43.934
Alright.

26:47.372 --> 26:49.039
Come on back.

26:50.776 --> 26:53.310
Alright, you wanna give
yourself a nice wide stance.

26:53.345 --> 26:55.045
Okay, keep your
finger right here.

26:55.080 --> 26:56.246
Not on the trigger,

26:56.281 --> 26:57.914
right here, alright.

26:57.949 --> 26:59.249
Put the other hand on the butt.

27:00.052 --> 27:01.251
You wanna hold it tight,

27:01.286 --> 27:03.120
right, keep it close
to your body.

27:03.155 --> 27:04.855
Bring it straight up.

27:04.890 --> 27:06.990
Look through the front
side, keep both eyes open,

27:07.025 --> 27:08.025
alright?

27:09.161 --> 27:10.994
Put your finger on the trigger,

27:11.029 --> 27:12.362
don't close your eyes.

27:15.400 --> 27:16.400
Just like that.

27:17.069 --> 27:18.135
Your turn.

27:21.773 --> 27:23.013
What I wanna want you to do is,

27:24.076 --> 27:25.109
I want you to breathe in,

27:26.278 --> 27:27.678
and exhale,

27:28.313 --> 27:29.413
you pull the trigger.

27:42.494 --> 27:43.827
That's my son.

27:43.862 --> 27:45.028
Now you're turn.

27:45.063 --> 27:46.140
Alright, keep your stance wide.

27:46.164 --> 27:48.265
Now you wanna be strong,
your arms wanna be strong,

27:48.300 --> 27:49.332
alright.

27:49.367 --> 27:50.467
Mmm-hmm.

27:50.502 --> 27:52.236
I want you to breathe...

27:54.906 --> 27:56.746
It's okay, alright,
keep it down, you are done.

27:59.077 --> 28:00.344
Go get them.

28:01.446 --> 28:02.879
Drunken cowboy.

28:04.282 --> 28:06.149
Hey, you wanna try?
Yeah.

28:06.184 --> 28:07.417
Are you sure?
Yeah, yeah.

28:07.452 --> 28:08.686
Let me load up, alright.

28:29.841 --> 28:30.874
Hey, mom.

28:30.909 --> 28:32.142
Hey, how was your day?

28:32.177 --> 28:33.210
It was great.
Yeah?

28:33.245 --> 28:34.311
We shot shit.

28:34.346 --> 28:36.113
What, did you hit anything?
No.

28:36.148 --> 28:38.915
What, that's not true.
Is this your target?

28:38.950 --> 28:40.050
I mean I didn't get...

28:40.085 --> 28:41.184
Yes, you did.

28:41.220 --> 28:42.897
What about you? Is this yours?
I did pretty well.

28:42.921 --> 28:44.888
What?
Yeah.

28:44.923 --> 28:46.434
Is that your first time with a gun.
Yeah, it is.

28:46.458 --> 28:47.858
Ace shooters we got.

28:47.893 --> 28:49.092
Mark shot the best you know.

28:49.127 --> 28:50.961
Bulls' eye right there.

28:50.996 --> 28:52.429
Bull's eye, best shot.

28:52.464 --> 28:54.197
We're gonna go.
See you, Karen.

28:54.232 --> 28:55.299
Okay.

28:57.369 --> 28:59.269
They had fun, huh?
Hmm.

28:59.304 --> 29:01.271
Missed you.
You're the fun.

29:02.040 --> 29:03.340
I have been thinking...

29:03.375 --> 29:04.375
Yep.

29:05.043 --> 29:06.243
How you said...

29:07.479 --> 29:09.813
How...

29:09.848 --> 29:13.016
We're like... A
family now, you know.

29:13.051 --> 29:14.051
What?

29:17.389 --> 29:19.422
Go on. What? Did I say
something like that?

29:19.457 --> 29:21.224
You did. Yes.
Did I?

29:21.259 --> 29:23.126
Really?
And I just...

29:23.161 --> 29:24.806
You wanna shack up?
I wondered if it maybe...

29:24.830 --> 29:26.263
We may?
Maybe you want...

29:27.499 --> 29:29.366
Move in? To move all
of your things here.

29:33.038 --> 29:34.338
Are you sure?
Yeah.

29:35.473 --> 29:36.573
Wait, are you sure?

29:36.608 --> 29:37.941
Yeah.
I don't wanna...

29:37.976 --> 29:39.943
No, no, I am sure. I am sure.
Okay.

29:39.978 --> 29:41.178
You make mark very happy.

29:41.213 --> 29:42.213
Yeah.

29:53.124 --> 29:54.891
You, barbecue.
Yeah.

29:54.926 --> 29:56.226
Set up that first.
Yeah.

29:56.261 --> 29:57.294
Hey, guys.

30:03.468 --> 30:04.534
How about this?

30:04.569 --> 30:05.602
Sure.

30:05.637 --> 30:07.538
Is this okay for you,
little lady?

30:09.074 --> 30:10.307
Yeah.
"Little lady"?

30:11.009 --> 30:12.075
What are you?

30:13.511 --> 30:14.911
Cave man?

30:14.946 --> 30:16.279
Yeah, I think I got.

30:16.314 --> 30:19.349
Maybe you wanna put it down I can
make you a nice warm dinner.

30:19.384 --> 30:22.886
Yeah.
And get you a beer.

30:22.921 --> 30:25.823
I don't know what kind
of woman your ex-wife was,

30:27.025 --> 30:28.425
but this is my house,

30:28.460 --> 30:31.395
my rules, you do the cooking
and cleaning, bitch.

30:32.998 --> 30:34.164
Get me a beer, woman.

30:36.101 --> 30:37.334
Fuck you.

30:37.369 --> 30:39.203
That's what I like.

30:40.205 --> 30:41.271
Jack!

30:41.306 --> 30:42.505
Yeah.

30:42.540 --> 30:43.574
Mark!

30:46.344 --> 30:49.145
Come on.
Let's go.

30:49.180 --> 30:50.740
Come out and help
us clean the stuff up.

30:56.054 --> 30:57.888
Hey, come on, now.

30:57.923 --> 30:59.423
Let's go, it wasn't a question.

31:00.058 --> 31:01.124
Alright.

31:03.094 --> 31:04.394
Hey, I almost had him.

31:04.429 --> 31:05.462
No, you didn't.

31:09.534 --> 31:11.101
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

31:16.608 --> 31:18.675
Come and get this new
bunk bed out of here.

31:18.710 --> 31:20.110
"Bunk bed"?
Yeah.

31:20.145 --> 31:21.522
Where do you think
you were gonna sleep?

31:21.546 --> 31:23.280
Planning to stay up all night?

31:23.315 --> 31:25.415
And paint each other's
toe nails.

31:37.128 --> 31:38.228
You got it?
Yeah.

31:48.606 --> 31:50.507
Yeah, that's what I like to see.

31:51.209 --> 31:52.442
Team work!

31:53.278 --> 31:54.311
Whoa, slow down.

32:01.086 --> 32:04.321
I got you a beer.
I got you a beer.

32:27.479 --> 32:28.712
Whoa, don't fall, don't fall.

32:56.408 --> 32:57.975
<i>Winter was sort of like a dream.</i>

33:00.512 --> 33:01.578
<i>How do you mean?</i>

33:05.316 --> 33:06.583
<i>First, everything was good.</i>

33:10.288 --> 33:11.808
<i>You know, good
like it hadn't been...</i>

33:13.091 --> 33:14.091
<i>In a long time...</i>

33:17.796 --> 33:19.696
<i>We felt like a family, you know.</i>

33:25.537 --> 33:26.670
But it didn't last,

33:28.173 --> 33:29.272
did it?

33:31.342 --> 33:33.176
It did.

33:33.211 --> 33:35.312
You know it did
for a while, yeah, it did.

33:40.819 --> 33:45.255
Was there a specific
moment when it ended?

33:53.398 --> 33:55.398
You're not gonna believe
me when I say this, but...

34:01.272 --> 34:03.106
I think I should
take an art class.

34:04.309 --> 34:05.442
That maybe a good idea.

34:06.377 --> 34:07.844
Which one you wanna take?

34:07.879 --> 34:09.512
I really don't care.

34:09.547 --> 34:11.648
As long as
there's no one this crazy.

34:11.683 --> 34:13.483
<i>Of a police report,</i>

34:13.518 --> 34:15.652
<i>stating that a body
has been found</i>

34:15.687 --> 34:17.821
<i>in Kurt Cobain's Seattle home.</i>

34:17.856 --> 34:19.489
<i>Initial reports
about the body...</i>

34:19.524 --> 34:20.924
Hey, what was that?

34:20.958 --> 34:23.393
<i>Male in his 20s,
with a shot gun wound</i>

34:23.428 --> 34:24.460
<i>through the head...</i>

34:24.496 --> 34:25.728
Oh, no, fuck this.

34:25.763 --> 34:27.174
Sarah, you have
to pull over the car.

34:27.197 --> 34:28.409
It hasn't been
confirmed yet, Jack.

34:28.433 --> 34:29.543
Pull over the car,
please right now.

34:29.568 --> 34:31.545
Will you please pull over the car?
Yes, yes. Alright.

34:31.569 --> 34:33.402
<i>- Three days.
- This follows...</i>

34:33.438 --> 34:34.737
Jack, what's the rush?

34:35.773 --> 34:37.273
Jack, come on.

34:37.308 --> 34:39.141
<i>To attend a drug...</i>

34:43.447 --> 34:47.650
<i>Back to the music now
on 1027 wb2x Albany.</i>

34:48.786 --> 34:49.786
Go.

34:55.159 --> 34:56.326
Jack.

34:57.162 --> 34:58.162
Jack.

35:37.335 --> 35:39.402
So I guess he did have
a gun after all.

35:39.871 --> 35:40.904
Mark.

35:54.352 --> 35:55.485
No one's asked me yet.

35:55.853 --> 35:57.253
What?

35:57.288 --> 35:58.621
To prom.

35:58.656 --> 36:00.523
So? Why don't you
just ask someone?

36:00.558 --> 36:01.724
It's not how it works.

36:01.759 --> 36:03.393
You'll be fine.

36:03.428 --> 36:05.195
I mean someone
will definitely ask you.

36:14.839 --> 36:16.907
Can we just go and get high?

36:17.609 --> 36:18.642
Yeah.

36:20.712 --> 36:22.579
I actually wanna make
it to senior year.

36:23.414 --> 36:24.714
Alright.

36:24.749 --> 36:26.183
Lets rock and roll.

36:26.784 --> 36:27.951
See you, Sarah.

36:27.986 --> 36:29.286
Yeah, see you.

37:14.966 --> 37:16.233
Jack.

37:26.644 --> 37:27.744
Hey, you know what?

37:30.415 --> 37:31.514
I just thought...

37:33.017 --> 37:34.417
You should ask Sarah to prom.

37:36.788 --> 37:37.988
No, I shouldn't.

37:38.890 --> 37:40.723
Yes, you should.

37:40.758 --> 37:41.891
No one's asked her yet,

37:41.926 --> 37:43.493
and fuck, she's really
bummed about it.

37:44.729 --> 37:47.030
She'd cheer up
about the thing...

37:47.065 --> 37:49.365
It's not a big deal,
you just pick her up,

37:49.400 --> 37:51.034
you wear something nice,

37:51.069 --> 37:52.936
you dance a little.

37:53.971 --> 37:56.039
Tell her she's pretty.

37:56.074 --> 37:58.675
At the end of the night,
you make out a little bit.

38:00.912 --> 38:02.045
What is it?

38:06.818 --> 38:08.584
I've never kissed anyone.

38:08.619 --> 38:09.786
Shut up.

38:09.821 --> 38:11.988
What the fuck, seriously?
Yeah.

38:12.023 --> 38:14.991
Come on, Jack, you've kissed...
You must've kissed someone.

38:15.026 --> 38:17.593
No, I've never kissed anyone.

38:17.628 --> 38:18.868
It just hasn't happened for me.

38:19.564 --> 38:20.830
Holy fuck.

38:24.369 --> 38:25.835
You're serious.

38:25.870 --> 38:27.437
Don't fucking laugh.
Fuck me, Jack.

38:27.472 --> 38:28.871
What have you been doing?

38:28.906 --> 38:30.884
I don't know I just haven't
found anyone I want to kiss.

38:30.908 --> 38:31.908
It's not...

38:33.444 --> 38:35.004
Don't fucking laugh at me.
Fuck you now.

38:36.447 --> 38:38.781
You've never... not
even your fucking hand?

38:38.816 --> 38:39.949
That doesn't fucking count.

38:39.984 --> 38:41.451
So you only kiss your mom?
Shut up.

38:43.421 --> 38:44.421
Jesus, Jack.

38:46.023 --> 38:47.890
I suppose I better
teach you how to kiss.

38:47.925 --> 38:49.726
I am sorry but are you...
I am too high...

38:49.761 --> 38:51.794
No, no, you shut up and listen.

38:51.829 --> 38:55.465
I'll go through the basic, the
basic things you need to know.

38:55.500 --> 38:57.534
First don't use too
much tongue, alright.

38:58.169 --> 38:59.869
Nobody likes that.

38:59.904 --> 39:01.838
Number two.

39:01.873 --> 39:04.107
Vibe it out right.
Take it slow.

39:04.142 --> 39:06.743
It's all about feeling,
and follow her, alright.

39:06.778 --> 39:08.545
How she feels, and third,

39:10.548 --> 39:12.648
close your eyes, otherwise
you'll look like a rapist.

39:12.683 --> 39:14.584
Yeah, fucking obviously.

39:14.619 --> 39:17.380
Fucking what do you mean obvious, Mr.
I've never kissed anyone before.

39:22.794 --> 39:23.993
You're ready?

39:24.028 --> 39:25.061
For what?

39:28.800 --> 39:29.960
I am gonna teach you to kiss.

39:32.737 --> 39:34.170
You're fucking with me.

39:34.205 --> 39:35.472
I'm not.

40:07.004 --> 40:08.471
You're fucking crazy.

40:09.240 --> 40:10.974
What is wrong with you?

40:13.110 --> 40:14.677
You sound fucking high?

40:14.712 --> 40:16.146
Me? You just
fucking kissed me.

40:19.851 --> 40:21.084
No, no, no, wait.

40:21.886 --> 40:23.486
Why?
Wait!

41:09.667 --> 41:10.667
Oye.

41:11.669 --> 41:12.902
Hands in the air, bitch.

41:12.937 --> 41:13.970
What the fuck.

41:15.006 --> 41:17.040
Fucking sweet. Come on.

41:17.842 --> 41:18.942
Let's go shoot some shit.

41:19.777 --> 41:21.110
What about your dad?

41:21.145 --> 41:23.145
What? He won't be back
for another couple of hours.

41:23.180 --> 41:24.614
He won't even notice.

41:25.716 --> 41:27.116
Chicken.

41:27.151 --> 41:28.751
Come on. You wanna go?

41:28.786 --> 41:30.520
Alright, lets do it.
Come on, lets go.

41:30.555 --> 41:31.654
This is a terrible idea.

42:06.190 --> 42:07.524
You see it?
Yeah.

42:08.025 --> 42:09.726
Okay. On three.

42:10.628 --> 42:12.695
One. Two.

42:13.030 --> 42:14.230
Three.

42:41.959 --> 42:43.092
Oh, fuck this.

42:52.203 --> 42:53.636
Fuck!

42:53.671 --> 42:55.071
Hey, you talked to Sarah?

42:55.106 --> 42:56.973
About what?

42:57.008 --> 42:58.374
She was talking
about this place,

42:58.409 --> 43:00.309
out somewhere near Leeds.
Yeah.

43:00.344 --> 43:02.011
It's a huge quarry.

43:02.046 --> 43:03.112
You wanna go?

43:03.147 --> 43:05.047
How are we gonna get there?

43:05.082 --> 43:07.016
We drive, Sarah's
parents have like four cars.

43:16.661 --> 43:17.727
Hey, dad.

43:19.664 --> 43:20.664
Hey, tom.

43:22.166 --> 43:23.399
What the fuck are you doing?

43:23.434 --> 43:25.735
We were just...
Nothing.

43:27.171 --> 43:28.891
Those are not supposed
to be used like that.

43:29.740 --> 43:31.340
Clean them up.
Put them away.

43:31.375 --> 43:32.942
Yeah, sorry.

43:35.680 --> 43:36.746
Mark.

43:37.314 --> 43:38.648
Come here.

43:45.723 --> 43:49.058
Did I not tell you and Jack
to clean this shit up?

43:49.093 --> 43:50.192
Yes, sir.

43:50.227 --> 43:51.427
Then get to it.

43:51.462 --> 43:52.995
Yeah, I'll do it later.
I just...

43:53.030 --> 43:54.163
No, you do it now.

44:00.971 --> 44:02.338
Fucking asshole.

44:02.373 --> 44:03.640
You okay?

44:28.299 --> 44:29.332
Fuck!

44:30.267 --> 44:31.668
Fucking ass.

45:43.374 --> 45:44.540
Bravo!

45:44.575 --> 45:46.142
Again, again, again!

45:53.083 --> 45:54.250
Whoo!

45:54.285 --> 45:55.384
Bravo!

45:57.922 --> 45:59.288
You're mad man.

45:59.323 --> 46:01.891
Fuck me. It's slipping.

46:01.926 --> 46:05.294
Oh, dude, that was fucking
awesome, man.

46:05.329 --> 46:06.428
It looked awesome.

46:06.463 --> 46:07.530
Let me hit it.
Yeah.

46:07.565 --> 46:09.198
Oh, intense, man.

46:09.233 --> 46:11.233
It was like... You're
just hanging on the edge,

46:11.268 --> 46:12.902
and then you jump off
and you're like,

46:12.937 --> 46:15.271
fucking stuck there
for decades, and then...

46:17.842 --> 46:20.009
Back to reality, man,
it's fucking awesome.

46:20.044 --> 46:21.210
You got to come?

46:21.245 --> 46:23.179
No, I-i...

46:23.214 --> 46:25.147
It's a little cold
right now, maybe later.

46:25.182 --> 46:27.550
Dude, come on, what the fuck.

46:27.585 --> 46:30.920
I would come but if we'd done earlier
maybe I am not gonna do it right now.

46:30.955 --> 46:33.322
No, man, we both know
the story you wanna tell,

46:33.357 --> 46:35.291
is that you swam across
that lake with me,

46:35.326 --> 46:36.826
and jumped off
that fucking rock,

46:36.861 --> 46:38.861
and that is fact, Jack.

46:38.896 --> 46:40.830
I will, I mean, yes,
you know that

46:40.865 --> 46:42.175
it would be a story
I wanted to tell...

46:42.199 --> 46:43.332
I am not gonna...

46:45.069 --> 46:47.136
Well, fuck you, then,
okay, alright.

47:06.223 --> 47:07.290
Come on, buddy.

48:19.430 --> 48:20.896
His voice is way
better than Lane.

48:20.932 --> 48:23.999
Dude, how can you take yourself
seriously when you say shit like that.

48:24.034 --> 48:25.167
What do you mean...

48:30.507 --> 48:32.374
That's not even the best
song in the album.

48:32.409 --> 48:34.276
That's not the best
song in the album either.

48:34.311 --> 48:35.678
Okay.
Alright. Alright.

48:35.713 --> 48:37.980
You don't know what
you're talking about.

48:38.015 --> 48:39.682
Shut up!

48:40.684 --> 48:41.951
Hey.

48:43.253 --> 48:44.320
How was school?

48:47.591 --> 48:48.591
They called.

48:50.060 --> 48:52.461
They said you've been
absent for three days.

48:53.597 --> 48:54.664
Where have you been?

48:56.066 --> 48:57.166
I am sorry, mom...

48:57.201 --> 48:58.481
You haven't been
going to school?

49:00.070 --> 49:01.715
You wanna be a fucking idiot
for the rest of your life?

49:01.739 --> 49:03.639
No!
I don't wanna hear it.

49:07.211 --> 49:09.311
You do it again, you don't
deal with the both of us,

49:09.346 --> 49:10.412
you deal with me.

49:10.447 --> 49:11.614
Tom.
What?

49:13.250 --> 49:14.416
Sorry, mom.

49:14.451 --> 49:16.385
No, it's okay, baby.

49:16.420 --> 49:18.098
Oh shit, Karen, you can't baby...
I am not...

49:18.122 --> 49:19.442
He needs to learn
some discipline.

49:20.591 --> 49:21.657
Uh-huh.

49:24.395 --> 49:25.461
Go to your room.

49:33.570 --> 49:34.603
I'll be back later.

49:40.677 --> 49:42.678
Here you go, Jack,
I guarantee you.

49:42.713 --> 49:44.747
Worst cup of coffee
you'll ever have in your life.

49:44.782 --> 49:46.349
You want cream or sugar, man?

49:49.219 --> 49:50.419
Uh, no.

49:50.454 --> 49:51.554
You're ready to continue?

49:52.389 --> 49:53.789
Yeah.
Great.

49:53.824 --> 49:57.259
And look, I am gonna ask you
questions, Jack, I...

49:57.294 --> 49:59.439
I just wanna emphasize,
this is just so that I can get,

49:59.463 --> 50:01.497
more of a understanding
of the relationship

50:01.532 --> 50:02.798
between you guys, okay.

50:02.833 --> 50:05.034
It's not to get you in trouble.
Do you understand?

50:06.503 --> 50:07.570
Okay.

50:10.107 --> 50:11.374
Were you guys using drugs?

50:15.379 --> 50:16.712
Jack, you can be honest, okay,

50:16.747 --> 50:18.547
it's absolutely normal behavior

50:18.582 --> 50:22.117
for any child going through
parental separation

50:22.152 --> 50:23.619
let alone living
in a small town.

50:23.654 --> 50:25.388
No one expects you
to be a Saint.

50:30.127 --> 50:31.160
I mean...

50:32.496 --> 50:34.263
Yeah. Sometimes.

50:34.298 --> 50:35.697
What kind?

50:35.732 --> 50:37.299
I mean was it mostly weed...

50:38.368 --> 50:39.502
Or was it hard stuff?

50:40.771 --> 50:42.104
It was mostly weed.

50:42.706 --> 50:44.273
Some alcohol.

50:44.308 --> 50:45.408
You like getting high?

50:48.812 --> 50:51.547
I mean, don't worry, Jack,
I went to college in the '60s,

50:51.582 --> 50:52.715
I saw it all.

50:54.685 --> 50:55.851
Yeah, of course.

50:55.886 --> 50:57.486
Yeah. Of course,
I liked it too.

50:57.521 --> 50:58.687
Back in the day.

51:06.196 --> 51:07.229
Jack.

52:01.618 --> 52:02.618
Fuck it!

52:04.454 --> 52:05.588
What the fuck.
What?

52:11.795 --> 52:12.862
So stupid.

52:19.603 --> 52:20.669
What?

52:42.960 --> 52:44.893
So how much did you guys
smoke in a normal week,

52:44.928 --> 52:47.163
you know, two-three times.
Four, five?

52:49.533 --> 52:50.599
At first...

52:52.736 --> 52:55.537
Only yeah, two, three
times, yeah.

52:55.572 --> 52:57.373
And when did it start
becoming more frequent?

53:01.311 --> 53:02.711
I don't know the spring time,
maybe.

53:04.414 --> 53:05.581
That was around the time...

53:07.751 --> 53:10.586
Started having a lot more
trouble at home, right?

53:12.789 --> 53:15.724
Yeah, but I don't think that had
anything to do with anything else.

53:17.628 --> 53:18.861
No vegetables please.

53:21.431 --> 53:23.498
How did your parents take it?

53:23.533 --> 53:26.268
Well, mostly they just
psycho analyzed me.

53:26.970 --> 53:28.503
Poor you.

53:28.538 --> 53:31.373
I take it, tom and Karen
weren't too thrilled?

53:31.408 --> 53:32.608
Excuse me.
No, they were not.

53:32.643 --> 53:34.576
Excuse me. Excuse me. Oh.

53:34.611 --> 53:36.345
Guys!
What are you doing?

53:36.380 --> 53:38.314
Come to the tunnel now.
I got to go.

53:39.516 --> 53:40.949
What the hell was that?

53:40.984 --> 53:42.351
I have no idea.

53:43.587 --> 53:44.987
We're not hungry anymore.
Thank you.

53:45.022 --> 53:46.288
We're so sorry.

53:51.361 --> 53:54.730
Because they fucking suck.
What are you doing on the floor?

53:56.433 --> 53:57.799
Yo, you're sketchy.

53:57.834 --> 54:00.369
What is that?

54:00.404 --> 54:02.482
Get down, get down, look at this.
Where did you find this?

54:02.506 --> 54:04.039
Shh. Shut up
and listen.

54:04.074 --> 54:06.908
Excellent camera work.
Great sound and lighting.

54:06.943 --> 54:10.279
And even a good soundtrack that
matches up with the action.

54:10.314 --> 54:12.514
The performers,
especially Paris,

54:13.083 --> 54:14.083
Sybil,

54:15.619 --> 54:17.719
the best of all girls
I have ever seen.

54:17.754 --> 54:18.954
Brad Williams.

54:18.989 --> 54:20.322
What movie is that?

54:21.358 --> 54:23.525
<i>Ghost-lusters.</i>
Oh, my god.

54:24.361 --> 54:25.894
Wait, when can we watch this?

54:25.929 --> 54:27.863
We are not gonna watch
this, you're a girl.

54:27.898 --> 54:29.831
This is a movie for men.

54:29.866 --> 54:32.434
You guys aren't men,
you're boys.

54:32.469 --> 54:34.603
You get like a boner,
after you see like

54:34.638 --> 54:36.749
a picture of a single boob.
That's just not even true.

54:36.773 --> 54:39.374
That's true.
It's kinda true.

54:39.409 --> 54:41.543
Like I have to deal
with shit, I bleed...

54:41.578 --> 54:44.379
Out of my vagina...
No! No, no, no, no. No.

54:44.414 --> 54:46.882
Fuck, man, why
can't you kill us?

54:50.721 --> 54:51.721
Go Paris!

54:55.359 --> 54:57.826
Yeah, no, yeah, I...

54:57.861 --> 55:01.363
Mmm-hmm. Just stop sending me
fucking collection notices.

55:03.066 --> 55:04.433
Hey, gorgeous.

55:05.102 --> 55:06.535
Hi.

55:06.570 --> 55:07.670
You okay?

55:10.040 --> 55:11.573
Um, no, not exactly.

55:12.609 --> 55:13.975
Can you tell me...

55:14.010 --> 55:16.045
What this is? Do you
know what this is?

55:17.547 --> 55:19.081
I was doing some research.

55:19.116 --> 55:20.682
"Research"?
Yeah.

55:20.717 --> 55:23.819
Into what? Into Jack
joining the marines?

55:24.421 --> 55:25.421
Well...

55:25.456 --> 55:27.656
Without a word to his
mother, without even...

55:27.691 --> 55:29.925
Stopping for a moment to realize
that you have no right.

55:29.960 --> 55:31.560
That's not fair, Karen.
None.

55:31.595 --> 55:33.005
I mean I was gonna
talk to you about it.

55:33.029 --> 55:34.996
"Talk to me"?
Talk to me?

55:35.031 --> 55:37.132
You're gonna give me
a heads up, no thanks, tom.

55:37.167 --> 55:38.811
He needs some structure,
some discipline...

55:38.835 --> 55:40.435
You think he needs
a little discipline.

55:40.470 --> 55:42.738
I mean apparently he didn't
inherit that from his daddy

55:42.773 --> 55:44.506
and you don't seem
too eager to teach him.

55:44.541 --> 55:46.708
It could be a good idea.

55:46.743 --> 55:49.511
I do not want my son
to be some kind...

55:49.546 --> 55:52.547
Of jar-head moron who goes around...
What! What!

55:52.582 --> 55:55.450
Raping...
I was a jar-head moron.

55:55.485 --> 55:58.520
It would be a privilege,
for Jack to join.

55:58.555 --> 56:01.089
It could even teach him
how to be a man.

56:01.124 --> 56:03.025
Instead of a nervous
little fucking girl.

56:05.629 --> 56:07.863
I don't need this shit
in my house.

56:07.898 --> 56:09.164
In your house?

56:09.199 --> 56:10.999
Yes, my house.

56:11.034 --> 56:12.133
You're house?
Yes, my house.

56:12.169 --> 56:15.437
I thought it was out house.
I thought we were a family.

56:15.472 --> 56:17.673
No more? Yeah, you
little fucking bitch.

56:19.142 --> 56:20.409
Hey, mark.

56:29.019 --> 56:31.019
<i>Can you... yeah...</i>

56:43.600 --> 56:45.467
<i>Yeah! You like that?</i>

56:45.936 --> 56:48.137
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

58:34.077 --> 58:35.544
Hey, wake up!

58:36.112 --> 58:37.212
Take that!

58:38.715 --> 58:40.615
Wait! Wait!

58:44.254 --> 58:46.121
Jack. Jack!

59:48.818 --> 59:49.952
Mom.

59:52.789 --> 59:53.922
Hey, mom.

59:56.059 --> 59:57.192
You alright?

01:00:01.031 --> 01:00:02.631
Mom, you wanna go to bed?

01:00:03.667 --> 01:00:04.700
Hey.

01:00:05.168 --> 01:00:06.234
Hey.

01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:07.936
Oh.

01:00:07.971 --> 01:00:09.204
You wanna go to bed?

01:00:10.106 --> 01:00:11.239
Yeah, come on.
Lets go.

01:00:23.286 --> 01:00:24.653
Do you wanna cuddle?

01:00:26.222 --> 01:00:27.623
I got to go to school.

01:00:29.759 --> 01:00:30.859
Yeah.

01:00:31.795 --> 01:00:32.828
Alright.

01:00:34.731 --> 01:00:36.632
You're such a good boy.

01:01:22.045 --> 01:01:23.365
Do you want
to go to prom with me?

01:01:26.950 --> 01:01:28.350
Jamie west already asked me.

01:01:31.955 --> 01:01:33.235
I told you someone
was gonna ask.

01:01:39.896 --> 01:01:41.063
What'd you say?

01:01:41.498 --> 01:01:42.731
I said yes.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.067
That's great.

01:01:46.503 --> 01:01:47.803
How's your mom?

01:01:48.505 --> 01:01:49.971
She'll be fine.

01:03:06.482 --> 01:03:08.116
He's probably just
running a little late.

01:03:11.287 --> 01:03:12.487
What time is it, dad?

01:03:15.525 --> 01:03:16.825
Nine.

01:03:20.363 --> 01:03:21.396
I am gonna go.

01:03:22.966 --> 01:03:23.999
Can I have the keys?

01:03:24.634 --> 01:03:25.934
I can drive you.

01:03:25.969 --> 01:03:26.969
No, it's fine.

01:03:33.476 --> 01:03:34.576
Thanks.

01:03:54.397 --> 01:03:55.997
Hey.

01:03:56.032 --> 01:03:58.166
Aren't you supposed
to be at prom?

01:03:58.201 --> 01:03:59.968
Yeah, I guess I got
left at the altar.

01:04:03.473 --> 01:04:04.572
Can I come in?

01:04:04.607 --> 01:04:06.140
Oh, no, yeah, of course.

01:04:06.175 --> 01:04:07.242
Yeah.

01:04:08.077 --> 01:04:09.410
Wait, what happened?

01:04:09.445 --> 01:04:12.046
I don't know, I guess
Jamie just never showed up.

01:04:12.081 --> 01:04:13.225
Probably took Katie or someone.

01:04:13.249 --> 01:04:14.282
I am so sorry.

01:04:15.652 --> 01:04:17.051
What the fuck.

01:04:17.086 --> 01:04:19.120
You have anything to drink?

01:04:19.155 --> 01:04:21.423
Yeah, orange juice, do
you want some milk?

01:04:25.628 --> 01:04:27.195
A drink, yeah.

01:04:27.230 --> 01:04:28.597
That... that will
be right by it.

01:04:35.271 --> 01:04:37.031
Jamie is an idiot,
don't even worry about it.

01:04:49.018 --> 01:04:50.151
I'm going outside.

01:04:52.055 --> 01:04:54.155
Wait.

01:04:54.190 --> 01:04:56.024
So he cornered me
in the cafeteria,

01:04:56.059 --> 01:04:58.960
like we barely hung out,
we skated like...

01:04:58.995 --> 01:05:02.063
Twice before. He's been at my house once.
I barely know this guy.

01:05:02.098 --> 01:05:03.898
But he comes up and says,
"we have a mission."

01:05:05.702 --> 01:05:07.669
So I... we both
run up to the...

01:05:09.372 --> 01:05:10.906
To the janitor's closet...

01:05:44.340 --> 01:05:48.109
My parents are a little bit
crazy, so I apologize in advance.

01:06:11.401 --> 01:06:12.334
I was wondering about

01:06:12.369 --> 01:06:15.003
how mark took the split
between you and Karen.

01:06:15.638 --> 01:06:17.038
I mean from all accounts

01:06:17.073 --> 01:06:19.507
he and Jack had become
incredibly close.

01:06:19.542 --> 01:06:22.076
They lived in the same room
they were best friends,

01:06:22.111 --> 01:06:23.445
they went to the same school.

01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:26.214
Really?

01:06:26.249 --> 01:06:28.082
So how did mark feel about being

01:06:28.117 --> 01:06:29.250
pulled from school?

01:06:37.493 --> 01:06:38.573
What do you want me to say?

01:06:39.529 --> 01:06:40.695
Huh?

01:06:42.465 --> 01:06:43.531
He hated it.

01:06:45.401 --> 01:06:46.468
He hated me.

01:06:48.371 --> 01:06:49.537
But he got over it.

01:06:49.572 --> 01:06:50.505
It had to happen.

01:06:50.540 --> 01:06:52.674
He came to realize that.
I put him to work.

01:06:55.344 --> 01:06:58.613
When you say it had to happen
you're referring to you...

01:06:58.648 --> 01:07:00.681
Leaving Karen's house?

01:07:00.716 --> 01:07:02.550
Was that more to do
with you and Karen

01:07:02.585 --> 01:07:04.686
or it had more to do
with Jack and mark?

01:07:05.621 --> 01:07:08.089
No, no! I... just fuck.

01:07:08.124 --> 01:07:10.491
I mean... yes.

01:07:10.526 --> 01:07:12.694
Yes. Karen and me.
That's it.

01:07:14.497 --> 01:07:16.064
Are we almost fucking done?

01:07:16.099 --> 01:07:18.019
Because I got a million
other things to do today.

01:07:20.303 --> 01:07:21.503
Yeah, I think she liked it.

01:07:22.638 --> 01:07:24.372
Where did you bring her?

01:07:24.407 --> 01:07:25.640
Washington park.

01:07:26.609 --> 01:07:27.709
Class.

01:07:29.445 --> 01:07:31.145
What?

01:07:31.180 --> 01:07:33.514
Were you aiming for the ground?

01:07:33.549 --> 01:07:36.217
You know, what we called her
when we went to school there?

01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:38.419
What?

01:07:38.454 --> 01:07:39.487
Fingers.

01:07:40.289 --> 01:07:42.356
Why?

01:07:42.391 --> 01:07:44.759
She got caught fingering
herself in science class.

01:07:44.794 --> 01:07:46.127
Shut up!

01:07:46.162 --> 01:07:48.296
Through your fucking
anatomy lesson.

01:07:48.331 --> 01:07:49.464
I swear to god.

01:07:49.499 --> 01:07:51.199
Oh, my god.
Fucking bull shit.

01:07:51.234 --> 01:07:53.394
I sweat to god. The whole
class could fucking smell it.

01:08:03.579 --> 01:08:04.712
What the hell, man?

01:08:04.747 --> 01:08:06.147
What are you gonna do, huh?

01:08:06.182 --> 01:08:07.548
Fuck you, man.
Yeah.

01:08:07.583 --> 01:08:09.283
I'll call the fucking police.

01:08:13.489 --> 01:08:14.789
Know to flop?

01:08:14.824 --> 01:08:16.191
Yeah. Yeah.

01:08:34.810 --> 01:08:36.176
Oh, shit.

01:08:37.647 --> 01:08:38.647
It's Jack.

01:08:41.216 --> 01:08:42.350
I guess that's Sarah.

01:08:42.885 --> 01:08:44.152
Mark.

01:08:46.622 --> 01:08:47.689
Hey.
Hey.

01:08:48.890 --> 01:08:50.125
Hey, Sarah.

01:08:54.863 --> 01:08:55.930
How you doing?

01:08:55.965 --> 01:08:57.232
Good.

01:09:01.404 --> 01:09:02.737
Hey, what?

01:09:02.772 --> 01:09:04.252
Too good to say a hi
to an old friend.

01:09:15.417 --> 01:09:16.651
Sarah, let's get outta here.

01:09:17.819 --> 01:09:19.187
Yo. We gotta go.

01:09:20.423 --> 01:09:21.523
Mark, come with us.

01:09:23.359 --> 01:09:24.759
Come on, come on, come on.

01:09:24.794 --> 01:09:26.227
Come on, come on, come on.

01:09:36.372 --> 01:09:37.805
Sarah's pretty cute.

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:39.207
You think?

01:09:42.877 --> 01:09:44.578
Oh, newspaper.
Newspaper.

01:09:44.613 --> 01:09:46.281
Hey, what's going on?
Clinton. Oh.

01:09:47.683 --> 01:09:48.716
Did you ever...

01:09:48.751 --> 01:09:49.984
What?

01:09:50.019 --> 01:09:51.519
Fuck her? Did you
ever fuck her?

01:09:51.554 --> 01:09:53.321
No. No, man,
it was just...

01:09:54.290 --> 01:09:55.723
We were just friends, you know.

01:09:56.892 --> 01:09:58.226
I fuck my friends.

01:10:00.796 --> 01:10:02.730
Well, I think she
is a little young for you.

01:10:03.633 --> 01:10:04.732
No.

01:10:04.767 --> 01:10:07.268
Fence. This is our dice.
Lucky dice.

01:10:07.303 --> 01:10:08.336
What about Jack?

01:10:08.371 --> 01:10:10.471
Your brother, half brother,
something like that?

01:10:14.710 --> 01:10:16.744
Oh, we got something
in here, man.

01:10:16.779 --> 01:10:18.246
It looks pretty...

01:10:19.415 --> 01:10:21.616
Oh, my fucking god.

01:10:22.485 --> 01:10:24.485
Bro, it's spinning.

01:10:25.688 --> 01:10:27.688
Oh, my god... I don't
know what the fuck...

01:10:33.562 --> 01:10:34.829
Give me this thing.

01:10:35.898 --> 01:10:36.965
What the... oh, shit.

01:11:36.759 --> 01:11:38.526
Yo! Someone's
coming out.

01:11:38.561 --> 01:11:39.627
Someone's coming.

01:12:49.698 --> 01:12:50.898
This is me, man.

01:12:51.801 --> 01:12:53.034
Ah, very nice.

01:12:54.170 --> 01:12:55.936
All right, man, good night.

01:12:55.971 --> 01:12:57.372
Yeah.
See you later.

01:13:12.755 --> 01:13:14.655
This here is detective Erickson.

01:13:16.158 --> 01:13:18.038
He wants to know what
you've been up to tonight.

01:13:19.128 --> 01:13:20.128
Good morning.

01:13:22.965 --> 01:13:24.598
Okay, Sarah,
we're almost done here,

01:13:24.633 --> 01:13:27.168
and I thank you for being
so patient and so helpful.

01:13:27.203 --> 01:13:29.003
Just a couple of more
questions, okay?

01:13:29.038 --> 01:13:30.504
Okay.

01:13:30.539 --> 01:13:33.107
When mark was gone
you and Jack, started dating.

01:13:34.810 --> 01:13:35.810
Yeah.

01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:39.747
Yeah, we did. Didn't
really workout though.

01:13:42.117 --> 01:13:43.884
It was kinda nice...

01:13:43.919 --> 01:13:45.697
To, you know, around be
together for a little bit.

01:13:45.721 --> 01:13:46.921
How long did that last?

01:13:48.157 --> 01:13:49.857
Not very long.

01:13:52.528 --> 01:13:53.594
Who called it off?

01:14:01.036 --> 01:14:02.603
You don't love me, right?

01:14:04.773 --> 01:14:06.774
Sure I do.

01:14:06.809 --> 01:14:08.742
But you're not
in love with me though.

01:14:08.777 --> 01:14:09.777
Right?

01:14:13.082 --> 01:14:14.215
No, I don't think so.

01:14:15.851 --> 01:14:17.118
Yeah, I don't think so either.

01:14:20.956 --> 01:14:22.156
Well, we tried.
Yeah.

01:14:27.129 --> 01:14:28.229
Hey.

01:14:29.632 --> 01:14:31.232
Do you mind if I
tried with other people?

01:14:32.067 --> 01:14:33.601
No. Of course not.

01:14:36.605 --> 01:14:37.805
I really want you to be happy.

01:14:38.807 --> 01:14:39.974
I want you to be happy too.

01:14:43.979 --> 01:14:46.514
Thanks.

01:14:46.549 --> 01:14:48.683
Jack, help me fill some of
these holes in, will you?

01:14:48.984 --> 01:14:50.051
Yeah.

01:14:52.588 --> 01:14:56.023
You and mark stopped seeing each
other after he and tom left.

01:14:57.860 --> 01:14:59.860
But obviously he found
his way back into your life.

01:15:01.964 --> 01:15:02.964
Yeah.

01:15:04.100 --> 01:15:06.100
And what brought you
guys back together?

01:15:14.577 --> 01:15:15.843
We just ran into each other.

01:15:20.182 --> 01:15:21.916
One night after the gas station.

01:15:28.190 --> 01:15:30.910
And tom had said he wasn't allowed
to hang out with those other guys.

01:15:33.128 --> 01:15:35.196
It's just kind of the same
shit he pulled with me.

01:15:38.167 --> 01:15:39.300
So I guess mark was kinda...

01:15:44.306 --> 01:15:45.606
Actually he was lonely.

01:15:49.111 --> 01:15:50.811
I don't mind the actual work.

01:15:51.981 --> 01:15:53.214
I sort of like it.

01:15:55.217 --> 01:15:56.984
It's just...

01:15:57.019 --> 01:15:58.853
It's just he wants
me to, you know...

01:15:59.221 --> 01:16:00.254
Fuck that.

01:16:01.357 --> 01:16:02.590
Yeah.

01:16:05.628 --> 01:16:07.261
So I've just been like...

01:16:07.296 --> 01:16:09.897
You know, getting
out every night,

01:16:11.667 --> 01:16:12.800
trying not to be around.

01:16:17.206 --> 01:16:19.574
I felt... felt bad...

01:16:20.709 --> 01:16:21.989
For running away
the other night.

01:16:23.912 --> 01:16:25.012
Things got pretty crazy.

01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:28.750
You hear about it?

01:16:29.918 --> 01:16:31.438
Yeah, I think
everybody heard about it.

01:16:34.723 --> 01:16:35.790
It's pretty cool.

01:16:42.364 --> 01:16:43.364
Jack.

01:16:49.104 --> 01:16:50.705
I've been thinking
a lot about...

01:17:11.694 --> 01:17:13.127
Told you he'd be here.

01:17:13.162 --> 01:17:14.261
Race you.

01:17:15.230 --> 01:17:16.631
Not fair.

01:17:18.267 --> 01:17:19.833
Hello, Jack.

01:17:19.868 --> 01:17:20.935
How's it going?

01:17:22.337 --> 01:17:23.638
Hey.
Hey.

01:17:25.708 --> 01:17:27.107
You tried to drop in yet?

01:17:27.142 --> 01:17:28.709
No.
No?

01:17:28.744 --> 01:17:29.810
Not today.

01:17:29.845 --> 01:17:31.846
I don't know, man.
Today is the day.

01:17:49.498 --> 01:17:50.865
What are you writing down?

01:17:52.768 --> 01:17:54.048
Hey, Jack, with all due respect,

01:17:54.937 --> 01:17:56.303
I am asking the questions.

01:18:01.210 --> 01:18:03.711
And how did you hear
about the accident?

01:18:03.746 --> 01:18:05.813
Jack called me.

01:18:05.848 --> 01:18:07.448
From the hospital he told me...

01:18:07.483 --> 01:18:09.216
What did he tell you?

01:18:09.251 --> 01:18:10.751
He told me about the accident.

01:18:13.322 --> 01:18:14.421
And what did he say...

01:18:14.456 --> 01:18:16.290
Exactly what... can you
remember?

01:18:16.325 --> 01:18:19.059
He was... he was crying,

01:18:19.094 --> 01:18:20.695
he was upset, he said...

01:18:21.964 --> 01:18:24.799
He said mark had fallen...

01:18:26.301 --> 01:18:28.335
And hit his head.

01:18:28.370 --> 01:18:31.138
And that he didn't
wake up, he was uh...

01:18:32.541 --> 01:18:36.176
He was... he just didn't
know what to do.

01:18:36.211 --> 01:18:37.845
He said he just fell down,

01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:39.180
it was a freak thing, you know.

01:18:41.550 --> 01:18:43.184
Was mark a good skater?

01:18:44.887 --> 01:18:47.321
Yeah, I mean
he was better than Jack.

01:18:47.356 --> 01:18:49.990
But it was common
for him to fall a lot?

01:18:51.226 --> 01:18:53.060
Yeah, I guess it's part
of the thing.

01:18:53.095 --> 01:18:54.729
What thing?
Skateboarding.

01:18:56.365 --> 01:18:58.031
So when he had the accident...

01:18:58.066 --> 01:19:00.033
I didn't see it.

01:19:00.068 --> 01:19:01.235
But you know what happened?

01:19:04.339 --> 01:19:05.806
I didn't see everything.

01:19:07.176 --> 01:19:10.978
Sarah, I need
you to tell me everything,

01:19:11.013 --> 01:19:12.213
that you saw.

01:19:12.981 --> 01:19:16.283
Exactly how you saw it.

01:19:16.318 --> 01:19:19.320
Okay? And you need
to keep in mind,

01:19:20.489 --> 01:19:22.456
that if you lie to me,

01:19:23.525 --> 01:19:26.059
you could be in a lot
of trouble.

01:19:26.094 --> 01:19:28.429
Even for the littlest things.

01:19:42.578 --> 01:19:43.844
Hey.

01:19:43.879 --> 01:19:44.879
Hey.

01:19:48.550 --> 01:19:49.883
Jack.

01:19:49.918 --> 01:19:51.078
What are you guys doing here?

01:19:53.222 --> 01:19:54.255
Good to see you, dude.

01:19:59.161 --> 01:20:00.261
What's up?

01:20:06.335 --> 01:20:07.335
Is something wrong?

01:20:10.973 --> 01:20:12.506
We just thought
you should know that...

01:20:13.542 --> 01:20:17.110
Me and Sarah are together now.

01:20:17.145 --> 01:20:19.346
We thought it'd be best
if you heard it from us.

01:20:19.381 --> 01:20:20.414
You know...

01:20:22.117 --> 01:20:23.483
This won't change anything

01:20:23.518 --> 01:20:24.985
between us, I promise.

01:20:27.356 --> 01:20:29.316
You just said you know
we could date other people.

01:20:36.164 --> 01:20:37.998
I am gonna let you
guys talk about this.

01:20:43.939 --> 01:20:46.273
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:20:46.308 --> 01:20:48.075
No, this is a fucking joke.

01:20:48.110 --> 01:20:49.877
Listen to me,
Jack. Listen, listen.

01:20:55.550 --> 01:20:58.018
I know I mean I've seen him
drop in a 100 pounds,

01:20:58.053 --> 01:20:59.987
no problem,

01:21:00.022 --> 01:21:02.233
I don't know what it was. It
was different about this time,

01:21:02.257 --> 01:21:04.124
but he just... he couldn't...
He just...

01:21:05.427 --> 01:21:07.294
You wanna know something, Jack?

01:21:07.329 --> 01:21:10.164
I believe that what you're saying
for the most part is true.

01:21:11.934 --> 01:21:14.234
And that is a courtesy,
that not a lot of people,

01:21:14.269 --> 01:21:16.069
are willing
to extend to you right now.

01:21:16.104 --> 01:21:17.115
Do you know what that means?

01:21:17.139 --> 01:21:19.240
It means that I am just
about the only friend,

01:21:20.008 --> 01:21:21.141
that you have left.

01:21:21.510 --> 01:21:22.877
Okay?

01:21:26.248 --> 01:21:28.015
And when I ask
you something, Jack,

01:21:28.050 --> 01:21:29.483
I want you to tell me the truth.

01:21:30.052 --> 01:21:31.052
Okay?

01:21:35.123 --> 01:21:36.490
And so for the last time,

01:21:37.726 --> 01:21:39.126
I am asking you,

01:21:41.229 --> 01:21:42.930
what was the fight,

01:21:42.965 --> 01:21:44.231
at the skate-park,

01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:46.100
about?

01:21:52.007 --> 01:21:53.567
I am gonna let you guys
talk about this.

01:22:04.119 --> 01:22:05.319
What the fuck is going on?

01:22:10.125 --> 01:22:11.469
This is a joke,
are you fucking kidding

01:22:11.493 --> 01:22:13.037
with me right now?
Jack, Jack, just listen.

01:22:13.061 --> 01:22:14.194
Alright, listen to me.

01:22:15.330 --> 01:22:16.697
I know how you feel, okay?

01:22:18.333 --> 01:22:20.167
And I never lied
to you, alright.

01:22:22.604 --> 01:22:25.572
I just... I can't
do this anymore, okay.

01:22:27.042 --> 01:22:29.009
Thought of being pointed
out is just...

01:22:29.044 --> 01:22:30.610
Is too much.
What the...

01:22:30.645 --> 01:22:32.446
No, no, Jack.

01:22:32.481 --> 01:22:33.680
It'll be easier this way.

01:22:33.715 --> 01:22:34.959
Okay? I promise.
What do you mean easy?

01:22:34.983 --> 01:22:37.295
What about you said before?
What about fuck everybody else?

01:22:37.319 --> 01:22:39.086
We are who we are right?

01:22:39.121 --> 01:22:41.601
So then what fucking changed?
Jack, it will be easier this way.

01:22:43.492 --> 01:22:44.524
No.

01:22:44.559 --> 01:22:45.726
Damn you!

01:24:08.543 --> 01:24:09.576
Hey.

01:24:13.515 --> 01:24:14.615
Hey.

01:24:15.817 --> 01:24:17.051
He's going to be okay.

01:24:17.752 --> 01:24:19.119
Oh, my god.

01:24:22.257 --> 01:24:23.290
Okay.

01:24:23.558 --> 01:24:24.591
Okay.

01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:27.094
Yeah.

01:24:28.230 --> 01:24:31.865
Listen, I am gonna stay
here, keep tabs on mark.

01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:33.700
You should bring him
home, get him cleaned up.

01:24:35.170 --> 01:24:36.303
Will you call us?

01:24:37.906 --> 01:24:39.139
Of course.

01:24:46.214 --> 01:24:48.749
Okay. Okay.

01:24:51.486 --> 01:24:52.719
Let's go home.

01:25:08.403 --> 01:25:09.670
Coming. Coming.

01:25:11.540 --> 01:25:13.206
Fuck.

01:25:13.241 --> 01:25:14.408
Yeah, what do you...

01:25:16.278 --> 01:25:17.478
Hey.
Hey.

01:25:19.181 --> 01:25:20.814
I got... we got some food.

01:25:22.517 --> 01:25:23.650
Can we come in?

01:25:23.685 --> 01:25:25.352
Yeah, yeah, of course,
come on in.

01:25:25.387 --> 01:25:26.787
Yeah, sure, sorry.
Little...

01:25:31.593 --> 01:25:33.393
Just... some kind...

01:25:33.428 --> 01:25:35.228
It's fine. You don't
have to clean up.

01:25:35.263 --> 01:25:37.698
No. We just brought... oh!

01:25:39.367 --> 01:25:41.601
I like this place, it's cozy.

01:25:41.636 --> 01:25:44.871
Please, you don't have to make me feel
better about it, it is what it is.

01:25:44.906 --> 01:25:47.741
No, I just meant it suits you.

01:25:49.744 --> 01:25:51.278
I don't know
what you mean by that.

01:25:51.313 --> 01:25:52.412
I didn't mean anything.

01:25:55.217 --> 01:25:57.717
Jack, he is in his room.

01:25:57.752 --> 01:25:58.819
If you want to see him.

01:25:59.888 --> 01:26:01.255
I don't know if he is awake.

01:26:03.925 --> 01:26:05.559
I am probably...
I'll just go check.

01:26:12.234 --> 01:26:13.711
Why don't you heat this up,
and then...

01:26:13.735 --> 01:26:15.636
Yeah, sure, sure,
microwave over here.

01:26:29.818 --> 01:26:30.884
Yeah, come in.

01:26:34.589 --> 01:26:35.622
Hey.

01:26:37.592 --> 01:26:38.592
What's up?

01:26:46.868 --> 01:26:48.368
You just dropped by or?

01:26:52.741 --> 01:26:55.809
I just wanted to stop by
and make sure you're okay.

01:26:55.844 --> 01:26:57.511
I am cool.
How you doing?

01:26:58.480 --> 01:26:59.646
Okay.

01:27:01.616 --> 01:27:03.316
How you feeling?

01:27:03.351 --> 01:27:05.519
Like I got skull fucked
by an angry rhino.

01:27:09.524 --> 01:27:10.724
Yeah.

01:27:10.759 --> 01:27:12.859
Better, actually.

01:27:12.894 --> 01:27:14.761
Better. Bored.

01:27:17.932 --> 01:27:19.833
What about...

01:27:19.868 --> 01:27:20.868
Ah, you didn't.

01:27:24.005 --> 01:27:26.340
Yes, my savior.

01:27:27.309 --> 01:27:28.375
You need a light?

01:27:28.410 --> 01:27:29.410
Yeah.

01:27:41.589 --> 01:27:42.589
You wanna sit?

01:27:52.467 --> 01:27:53.867
Your dad's not gonna smell?

01:27:54.569 --> 01:27:56.336
No.

01:27:56.371 --> 01:27:58.331
This guy's head is way
too far up his fucking ass.

01:27:59.708 --> 01:28:00.941
He smells shit.

01:28:13.988 --> 01:28:15.355
Here you go.

01:28:15.390 --> 01:28:16.423
Thanks.

01:28:26.768 --> 01:28:27.868
You mind if I rest my head?

01:28:31.005 --> 01:28:32.639
No, not at all.

01:28:52.394 --> 01:28:53.560
I am really sorry.

01:28:54.929 --> 01:28:56.663
I don't remember anything, man.

01:28:57.932 --> 01:28:59.066
It's weird.

01:29:11.579 --> 01:29:12.779
Do you want some more of this?

01:29:52.821 --> 01:29:53.987
What are you doing?

01:29:57.892 --> 01:29:59.059
Come on.

01:30:01.596 --> 01:30:02.696
You owe it.

01:30:03.131 --> 01:30:04.998
And I owe it.

01:30:05.033 --> 01:30:07.467
And I think we owe his
parents an explanation.

01:30:08.870 --> 01:30:10.181
And that's all that
I am looking for.

01:30:10.205 --> 01:30:12.972
No, I wouldn't... never...
Have done anything.

01:30:13.007 --> 01:30:14.741
But you keep lying to me.
No, I didn't.

01:30:14.776 --> 01:30:19.212
Do you understand, Jack? Do you
understand what my concern is now?

01:30:19.247 --> 01:30:21.114
I would've never done
anything to hurt him...

01:30:21.149 --> 01:30:23.716
My concern is that you've been
lying to me the whole time.

01:30:23.751 --> 01:30:26.520
And why am I supposed to believe
anything that you say now?

01:30:27.255 --> 01:30:29.122
He was my best friend.
I...

01:30:29.157 --> 01:30:30.690
And he is dead, Jack.

01:30:34.529 --> 01:30:36.696
Look, look.

01:30:36.731 --> 01:30:39.799
I understand that what happened at
the skate park was an accident.

01:30:39.834 --> 01:30:41.634
I mean you were angry,
you were pissed off.

01:30:41.669 --> 01:30:43.770
It's understandable,
maybe mark lied to you.

01:30:43.805 --> 01:30:46.706
Maybe he didn't, but it's
understandable, do you understand,

01:30:46.741 --> 01:30:48.442
what I am saying?
We get that.

01:30:51.279 --> 01:30:52.546
But the woods, Jack.

01:30:54.682 --> 01:30:55.962
What happened
at the woods, Jack?

01:31:00.722 --> 01:31:01.855
What happened at the woods?

01:31:40.595 --> 01:31:41.695
Hello.

01:31:42.163 --> 01:31:43.263
Hey.

01:31:46.067 --> 01:31:47.133
It's good.

01:31:50.939 --> 01:31:52.138
I don't have any plans yet.

01:31:57.278 --> 01:31:59.613
No, she had to pick
up extra hours.

01:32:03.051 --> 01:32:04.117
Yeah.

01:32:06.354 --> 01:32:07.621
See you soon.

01:32:09.090 --> 01:32:10.156
Okay, bye.

01:32:20.969 --> 01:32:22.235
Are you okay?

01:32:22.270 --> 01:32:23.570
Yeah.

01:32:23.605 --> 01:32:24.605
Great.

01:32:48.396 --> 01:32:49.696
It's okay.

01:32:59.040 --> 01:33:01.207
Please. Just... don't, Jack.

01:33:08.816 --> 01:33:09.950
Why not?

01:33:21.229 --> 01:33:22.362
I wish you were a girl.

01:33:29.370 --> 01:33:30.704
Yeah.

01:35:13.508 --> 01:35:14.774
How do I look?

01:36:05.393 --> 01:36:06.926
It'll match your lipstick.

01:37:25.940 --> 01:37:27.206
Jack.

01:37:30.077 --> 01:37:31.211
Come on.

01:37:33.681 --> 01:37:34.914
Let's go.

01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:14.407
I would like to see a lawyer.

01:40:41.635 --> 01:40:43.636
Help! Help!

01:40:44.505 --> 01:40:46.639
Help! Somebody.

01:40:49.210 --> 01:40:50.243
Help!

01:40:52.313 --> 01:40:53.546
Help!
