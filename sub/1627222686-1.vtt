WEBVTT

02:30.667 --> 02:32.502
Tell me this never has to end.

02:34.772 --> 02:41.078
All things wither, Bruce,
but if we're lucky... not for a long time.

02:49.253 --> 02:50.687
Aren't you forgetting something?

02:58.595 --> 02:59.595
Again?

03:41.138 --> 03:42.672
I can't resist you.

03:54.251 --> 03:55.953
No man can.

05:28.045 --> 05:30.781
You've been a good boy.

05:30.815 --> 05:34.385
The foundation
was such a burden to you,

05:34.418 --> 05:39.223
to us... just like
the rest of the company.

05:44.862 --> 05:48.598
You know what you have to do
so we can be together.

06:02.379 --> 06:04.882
Mr. Wayne, I think you've
over fed your philodendron.

07:00.070 --> 07:01.070
Stop!

07:14.351 --> 07:17.687
This isn't you, Bruce.
She's controlling you somehow.

07:20.858 --> 07:22.826
Oh, hell. Sorry!

08:21.285 --> 08:23.754
Oh.

08:30.494 --> 08:33.564
How did you know?

08:33.597 --> 08:36.800
Well, you haven't exactly
been discreet.

08:36.834 --> 08:40.804
Appearing with Ivy in public and
signing assets over to the Roman.

08:42.473 --> 08:44.775
I'll wake the lawyers, sir.

08:46.443 --> 08:48.312
Police will be here any minute.

08:48.345 --> 08:50.465
Tell them everything you
remember and then get to bed.

08:51.248 --> 08:52.248
You look awful.

08:53.484 --> 08:55.953
I told you
I don't want a partner.

08:58.322 --> 09:00.357
You sure wanted one
these past three months.

09:01.859 --> 09:04.328
Three months?

09:04.361 --> 09:07.564
It took a while to catch the jolly
green jezebel with her guard down.

09:09.066 --> 09:11.268
- And holiday?
- Still at large.

09:25.482 --> 09:28.252
Gilda, I'm sorry.
We'll make the late movie.

09:28.285 --> 09:30.154
I'm looking forward to it.

09:30.187 --> 09:32.356
I think I'd like to go home.

09:32.389 --> 09:33.557
Why? We can...

09:35.025 --> 09:37.194
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

09:57.448 --> 09:59.116
Jesus!

10:00.584 --> 10:01.584
Harvey...

10:03.954 --> 10:04.954
You were right.

10:09.259 --> 10:11.295
Chong's been supplying holiday
with his guns.

10:16.266 --> 10:20.003
You should have listened to me,
Jim, moved on this guy sooner.

10:20.037 --> 10:22.005
We might have learned something.

10:22.039 --> 10:24.875
The holiday killer's
covering his tracks.

10:27.611 --> 10:28.611
Mother's day.

10:29.513 --> 10:30.881
This one snuck up on us.

10:31.982 --> 10:32.982
Sure did.

10:34.685 --> 10:35.685
Where's our friend?

11:09.353 --> 11:11.088
Who helped you escape?

11:11.121 --> 11:13.090
Give me a name or I'll...

11:49.626 --> 11:52.095
It was my mother.

11:53.163 --> 11:56.433
That's who helped me.

11:56.467 --> 12:00.437
I strangled the old witch
years ago,

12:00.471 --> 12:07.010
but I think she still watches
over handsome little jonny.

12:16.220 --> 12:18.622
Happy mother's day.

12:28.632 --> 12:29.632
Mother.

12:41.311 --> 12:42.311
Through here.

12:47.718 --> 12:49.358
Sweetheart,
I don't know if this is the...

12:52.322 --> 12:54.792
Take what you want.
Don't hurt us.

14:01.325 --> 14:02.693
Is he okay?

14:02.726 --> 14:04.194
I don't care. Let's go.

14:15.873 --> 14:17.240
Bruce, what are you doing?

14:23.413 --> 14:24.448
Mother?

14:25.582 --> 14:26.683
We have to get you home.

14:37.494 --> 14:38.494
Bruce!

14:39.864 --> 14:41.331
Where... where is she, Alfred?

14:42.800 --> 14:45.770
- She?
- My... my mother.

14:47.571 --> 14:48.806
I was with my mother.

14:56.580 --> 14:57.882
Up we go.

15:11.261 --> 15:13.263
<i>Gotham police
are searching for two inmates</i>

15:13.296 --> 15:15.699
<i>that escaped
from arkham asylum last night.</i>

15:15.732 --> 15:19.703
<i>One of them, Dr. Jonathan
crane, aka the scarecrow,</i>

15:19.736 --> 15:22.572
<i>stole one of arkham's horses
from the grounds.</i>

15:22.606 --> 15:24.776
<i>He's considered
extremely dangerous.</i>

15:24.809 --> 15:26.811
<i>Anyone with knowledge
of his whereabouts</i>

15:26.844 --> 15:29.881
<i>needs to call the Gotham pd
hotline right away.</i>

15:29.914 --> 15:32.215
<i>Again, he's considered
highly dangerous.</i>

15:34.317 --> 15:35.317
Wait.

15:37.654 --> 15:38.756
I packed your lunch.

15:44.896 --> 15:47.631
Thanks. I gotta go.

16:12.990 --> 16:14.357
I've come to see my father.

16:19.063 --> 16:20.330
It's a tie.

16:22.767 --> 16:26.503
And, yes,
my parole officer knows I'm here.

16:38.582 --> 16:41.284
Sofia, my little girl.

16:42.820 --> 16:45.355
Heat give you
any trouble downstairs?

16:45.388 --> 16:48.692
There's more cops here than I ever
saw in ten years on the inside.

16:48.725 --> 16:53.563
"Holiday detail." For my
protection, or so they tell me.

16:53.597 --> 16:57.501
- Listen, I'm very busy, so...
- That's why I need to talk to you.

16:57.534 --> 17:00.737
Poppa, I want to be in the room.

17:00.772 --> 17:02.774
Sofia, we have
already discussed...

17:02.807 --> 17:05.509
I executed the crane escape
like you ordered.

17:05.542 --> 17:07.511
And this foolish war
with sal maroni, I think...

17:07.544 --> 17:08.712
<i>Basta!</i>

17:15.086 --> 17:17.755
Things... are strained.

17:20.524 --> 17:25.029
Half our top earners have been taken
out by either holiday or maroni.

17:25.062 --> 17:30.333
We had a chance with Wayne, but now
that he's out, we have to restructure.

17:31.836 --> 17:34.404
That is exactly why you need me.

17:35.907 --> 17:38.508
I do not.

17:38.542 --> 17:44.347
Sofia, if I bring you in now, our new earners
will think I am lining up a successor.

17:44.381 --> 17:47.584
And that will make me
look old... and weak.

17:49.386 --> 17:50.720
You are neither.

17:51.956 --> 17:53.423
Nevertheless.

18:00.131 --> 18:02.532
Good. End of discussion.

18:04.734 --> 18:07.370
Now go buy something.

18:07.404 --> 18:11.943
Big, flashy. A dress, a car. I don't care.
Just make sure everybody sees it.

18:18.950 --> 18:20.550
Happy father's day, poppa.

18:33.730 --> 18:35.800
Awful business at first Gotham.

18:35.833 --> 18:37.567
How do you know
it was the scarecrow?

18:37.601 --> 18:39.837
Crane recently fled arkham.

18:39.871 --> 18:42.706
Gases all of his victims with a
fear-inducing neurotoxin, so...

18:42.739 --> 18:44.574
Yeah, you can't really miss him.

18:44.608 --> 18:48.545
- Look, so, Mr. Wayne...
- It's Bruce.

18:48.578 --> 18:51.883
Can I get you anything?
Alfred makes a terrific Mai Tai.

18:54.218 --> 18:56.486
It's 8:30 in the mor...

18:56.519 --> 18:59.790
No... no, thank you.

18:59.824 --> 19:02.525
We have some questions
about new year's Eve.

19:02.559 --> 19:04.728
The night Alberto Falcone
was murdered.

19:04.762 --> 19:06.730
Harvey here was updating
the files.

19:06.764 --> 19:08.775
And it seems that you were the
only passenger on that yacht

19:08.799 --> 19:10.600
who didn't give us a statement.

19:10.634 --> 19:12.469
Afraid I'm not much help.

19:12.502 --> 19:15.039
I left the party before all
the commotion in a dinghy.

19:15.072 --> 19:17.641
You probably noticed
it was missing.

19:17.674 --> 19:20.845
Of course, I'd have given you
a statement anyway,

19:20.878 --> 19:23.114
except that it would have been
a matter of public record

19:23.147 --> 19:26.817
and could place my name next to that
of the young lady I went to meet.

19:26.851 --> 19:29.086
I don't think her husband
likes me very much.

19:29.120 --> 19:30.587
That's very convenient.

19:30.620 --> 19:32.023
Well, not for her husband.

19:36.160 --> 19:37.995
Here's what
I'm trying to understand.

19:38.029 --> 19:40.998
You recently signed over
significant areas of your business

19:41.032 --> 19:44.701
- to carmine Falcone.
- That's all been reversed.

19:44.734 --> 19:47.939
And I was drugged and manipulated,
if that's what you mean.

19:47.972 --> 19:49.706
Was your father drugged
and manipulated

19:49.739 --> 19:51.842
when he went into business
with the Roman?

19:51.876 --> 19:53.743
You know everything
that monster is today

19:53.778 --> 19:56.680
was born of the legitimacy
handed him by the name Wayne...

19:56.713 --> 19:58.816
Harvey.

19:58.849 --> 20:02.019
It's all right. Yes,
my father built hospitals with Falcone...

20:04.088 --> 20:05.790
But the only influence
he was under

20:05.823 --> 20:09.894
was an overwhelming desire
to save innocent lives.

20:09.927 --> 20:12.629
And how many other innocent lives
did he end up trading for it?

20:14.765 --> 20:16.901
Two... that I know of.

20:39.290 --> 20:41.591
Please help my son.

20:41.624 --> 20:43.060
I have nowhere else to go.

20:43.094 --> 20:46.764
- This way! Over here.
- Onto the desk.

20:46.797 --> 20:52.837
Looks like four...
No, five bullet wounds to the chest.

20:52.870 --> 20:56.573
You shouldn't have come here.
Your son needs to be in a hospital.

20:56.606 --> 20:59.243
Where Luigi maroni could
find him and finish the job?

20:59.276 --> 21:02.313
No, Dr. Wayne, please.

21:02.346 --> 21:04.248
Carmine is my only son.

21:06.951 --> 21:08.651
I'll do what I can.

21:10.287 --> 21:12.823
- Alfred, get my bag.
- Right away, sir.

21:26.669 --> 21:30.007
He's stable, but I don't want
to move him yet.

21:30.041 --> 21:33.077
<i>Grazie.</i> I can never repay you.

21:34.744 --> 21:36.679
He isn't out of the woods.

21:36.713 --> 21:38.049
Come on,
we have to let him rest.

21:58.169 --> 21:59.170
You shouldn't be here.

22:00.871 --> 22:02.373
It's okay.

22:02.406 --> 22:03.874
Do you know who my father is?

22:05.376 --> 22:06.376
The Roman?

22:08.813 --> 22:10.680
Smart kid.

22:10.713 --> 22:12.183
So you know who I'm going to be?

22:13.851 --> 22:14.851
The Roman.

22:16.921 --> 22:18.089
Very smart.

22:20.991 --> 22:22.259
You remind me of my boy.

22:23.427 --> 22:24.929
Your pop saved my life.

22:26.931 --> 22:28.165
I guess that makes us family.

22:31.202 --> 22:33.003
It fell out of your pocket.

22:33.037 --> 22:35.039
My insurance policy.

22:35.072 --> 22:36.841
There's a lot of bad people
out there.

22:37.707 --> 22:39.176
Criminals.

22:39.210 --> 22:43.680
And everybody knows criminals
are superstitious.

22:43.713 --> 22:49.186
Sometimes all it takes to get out of a
bad situation is a good flip of the coin.

22:49.220 --> 22:50.821
It didn't work for you tonight?

22:52.256 --> 22:54.992
Yeah.

22:55.025 --> 22:57.995
Still, two heads
are better than one.

22:58.896 --> 22:59.896
No?

23:02.867 --> 23:03.867
Keep it, kid.

23:04.969 --> 23:07.338
All we get is all we take.

23:11.876 --> 23:14.778
I was eight when Dr. Thomas Wayne
pulled Luigi maroni's bullets

23:14.812 --> 23:16.013
out of Falcone's chest.

23:18.249 --> 23:23.454
My father was dead by a
mobster's hand within a year.

23:23.487 --> 23:26.757
Any connection between my family
and the Roman died then, too.

23:28.425 --> 23:31.762
Thank you for stopping by.
If there's nothing else...

23:34.832 --> 23:37.734
Gentlemen,
these are the names and addresses

23:37.768 --> 23:42.406
for those who can account for master Wayne's
whereabouts on the night in question.

23:42.439 --> 23:46.709
A lot of names on here.
Must have been quite a night.

23:46.743 --> 23:50.915
Yes, well, a man was murdered.

23:50.948 --> 23:54.251
Let us hope your respective
offices can deliver for him

23:54.285 --> 23:57.254
the justice still denied
Thomas and Martha Wayne.

23:59.056 --> 24:01.325
What happened to them
was a tragedy.

24:01.358 --> 24:06.063
And all the more reason why your boss
should stay away from men like Falcone.

24:06.096 --> 24:08.399
Will there ever be a time
when the sins of fathers

24:08.432 --> 24:10.733
don't fall to their sons
for redemption?

24:11.902 --> 24:12.937
Good day.

24:18.142 --> 24:22.913
They're going to be watching my every move
today to confirm that I'm not the killer.

24:22.947 --> 24:24.281
Then you'll be staying in?

24:26.116 --> 24:28.718
No, just pay off
some more alibis.

24:31.021 --> 24:32.021
I have to go to work.

24:46.103 --> 24:47.905
Sit tight.

24:47.938 --> 24:49.458
If he knew about us,
it would kill him.

24:51.175 --> 24:52.343
I'll be right here, love.

25:06.323 --> 25:07.992
Your favorite cannolis.

25:08.025 --> 25:12.096
Cannoli. Cannolo for one,
cannoli for a box.

25:12.129 --> 25:14.164
Your Italian is <i>sterco.</i>

25:14.198 --> 25:16.467
I know, poppa. I'm sorry.

25:16.500 --> 25:19.903
Yeah. You bring cannoli
on father's day, I forgive.

25:19.937 --> 25:21.038
Sit.

25:23.107 --> 25:24.107
So...

25:26.210 --> 25:29.313
This war with Falcone.
It's killing us, pop.

25:29.346 --> 25:32.583
Carmine thinks we've got something
to do with this... this holiday jerk.

25:32.616 --> 25:34.818
<i>Sciocchezze.</i>

25:34.852 --> 25:39.156
Carmine's paranoia is not to do
with holiday but with the new da.

25:39.189 --> 25:42.059
Unless these two are one
and the same.

25:44.495 --> 25:47.831
Dent's a crusader but I can't
see him getting his hands dirty.

25:49.033 --> 25:50.234
More likely the bat.

25:51.468 --> 25:55.105
You want advice? Win or lose,

25:55.139 --> 25:58.976
the only thing that ends war
is peace.

25:59.009 --> 26:01.345
Make peace with carmine?

26:04.481 --> 26:05.481
Poppa...

26:06.183 --> 26:07.318
I don't know.

26:07.351 --> 26:08.351
I don't...

26:11.955 --> 26:12.955
Poppa!

26:16.427 --> 26:17.427
Poppa!

26:41.552 --> 26:42.552
Sal!

26:43.687 --> 26:44.955
I heard a gunshot.

26:45.622 --> 26:46.622
Are you okay?

26:47.925 --> 26:48.925
What happened?

27:55.993 --> 27:58.162
Strange place to do business.

27:58.195 --> 28:01.365
Guessing it's the last spot the
pigs leave you alone these days.

28:40.671 --> 28:42.673
Working late?

28:42.706 --> 28:44.475
How the hell
did you get through security?

28:50.514 --> 28:52.416
You were with him, right?

28:52.449 --> 28:56.086
I needed to put an end to the
stupid war with the falcones.

28:56.119 --> 29:00.491
My father's last words to me were that
I should make peace with my enemy.

29:03.327 --> 29:06.129
At first I thought
he meant carmine,

29:06.163 --> 29:09.299
but Luigi maroni
would have never wanted that.

29:11.301 --> 29:14.538
There's only one other thing
he could have meant, so...

29:22.112 --> 29:26.049
I'm here to make peace with the law.
Cut a deal.

29:26.083 --> 29:28.285
You want Falcone
and I got plenty on him.

29:30.420 --> 29:31.700
Enough to put him away for good.

29:38.161 --> 29:39.831
In exchange for...

29:39.864 --> 29:42.699
Dropping all outstanding
warrants against me and my men.

29:45.302 --> 29:46.403
You want Falcone?

29:47.805 --> 29:50.407
That's the deal.
Take it or leave it.

29:52.844 --> 29:56.046
Tell you what.
Heads, I'll take it.

30:26.243 --> 30:28.579
I expected a low turnout
after the new year's fiasco.

30:28.612 --> 30:32.482
- But this is really pathetic.
- Fine by me.

30:32.516 --> 30:35.319
The more people stay home,
the easier my job gets.

30:35.352 --> 30:37.154
Speaking of jobs getting easier,

30:37.187 --> 30:38.823
is it true you got maroni?

30:38.856 --> 30:40.758
It's not a done deal.

30:40.792 --> 30:42.894
My office is working out
the details now.

30:42.927 --> 30:45.696
But if ol' sal tells a judge
what he's told me...

30:45.729 --> 30:47.664
Let's just say today's
a good day for the Roman

30:47.698 --> 30:50.133
to celebrate
what's left of his freedom.

30:52.369 --> 30:54.072
Speak of the devil.

31:04.548 --> 31:07.551
I'm surprised to find you
outdoors on a holiday.

31:07.584 --> 31:09.921
- Dent.
- Falcone.

31:09.954 --> 31:13.390
Actually, I was speaking
to your wife... Mrs. Dent.

31:13.423 --> 31:14.423
Don't touch her.

31:16.393 --> 31:20.330
I never took you
for a patriot, carmine.

31:20.364 --> 31:22.800
Oh, I wouldn't miss fireworks
like this for all the world.

31:24.701 --> 31:26.838
Good evening,
Mrs. Dent, captain.

31:27.638 --> 31:28.806
Evening.

31:38.281 --> 31:42.486
I tell you, harv, if I could, I'd have
every cop in the city here tonight.

32:23.660 --> 32:25.897
See you on the other side.

33:09.506 --> 33:13.845
Utter
inanity proved his insanity

33:13.878 --> 33:17.247
while he rattled
a couple of bones.

33:31.695 --> 33:35.565
I've been thinking about it
and maybe you're right.

33:35.599 --> 33:37.534
Uh, about what?

33:43.640 --> 33:44.942
Having kids.

33:54.618 --> 33:55.753
Stay down.

34:00.057 --> 34:02.392
Get to Gordon. I'll be back.

34:02.425 --> 34:04.962
Harvey, no. Harvey!

34:25.850 --> 34:27.684
Get out of here.

34:27.717 --> 34:30.755
Not till I know why this
scumbag is trying to kill me.

34:30.788 --> 34:34.624
If I was trying to kill you,
you'd would be dead already.

34:35.993 --> 34:37.995
Then what are you...

34:47.004 --> 34:48.039
That's enough.

34:52.742 --> 34:54.812
Someone's trying
to provoke you, dent.

34:54.846 --> 34:56.080
Into doing what?

34:57.782 --> 34:59.382
Good question...

36:06.817 --> 36:08.052
<i>Get up.</i>

36:09.854 --> 36:11.923
The walrus and the carpenter

36:11.956 --> 36:14.825
were walking close at hand.

36:14.859 --> 36:20.798
They wept like anything
to see such quantities of sand.

36:20.831 --> 36:25.169
"If seven maids with seven mops
swept it for half a year,

36:25.202 --> 36:30.775
"do you suppose," the walrus said,
"that they could get it clear?"

36:30.808 --> 36:33.710
Huh... I doubt it.

36:40.251 --> 36:41.551
There...

36:42.987 --> 36:45.522
That's the drop.

36:48.125 --> 36:50.861
As for the bat,

36:50.895 --> 36:53.764
delivering him
wasn't part of the deal.

36:53.798 --> 36:58.702
So we can do
whatever we want with him.

36:58.735 --> 37:02.106
What fun.

37:08.980 --> 37:11.849
Twinkle, twinkle little bat...

37:13.985 --> 37:18.155
How I wonder what you're...

37:18.189 --> 37:22.193
Your business with the Roman
ends tonight.

37:24.661 --> 37:26.230
No.

37:33.270 --> 37:38.575
Poor little thing.
Such a tiny little thing.

38:07.138 --> 38:09.240
No.

38:14.879 --> 38:16.646
- Down here.
- What do you got?

38:16.679 --> 38:17.882
<i>Run!</i>

38:24.388 --> 38:26.689
<i>Motive means opportunity.</i>

38:26.723 --> 38:28.625
<i>Dent. All right,
let me be clear,</i>

38:28.658 --> 38:31.929
<i>this freak is done
terrorizing my family. Done!</i>

38:31.962 --> 38:35.099
<i>You expect us to believe that
a respected public servant...</i>

38:35.132 --> 38:38.735
- I don't know why you watch that garbage.
- Is it true?

38:38.769 --> 38:40.137
You believe this bs?

38:40.171 --> 38:42.039
Is that why you want a divorce?

38:42.073 --> 38:44.942
I never said that.
I have been talking about therapy.

38:44.975 --> 38:49.313
Maybe divorce isn't so bad,
now that you can't go back to him...

38:49.346 --> 38:51.215
<i>Ungrateful bitch.</i>

38:55.652 --> 38:58.588
I'm... I'm sorry.
I don't know why I said that.

39:01.258 --> 39:02.692
I'm going to be late for court.

39:06.230 --> 39:09.100
You left the basement door
open again.

39:09.133 --> 39:11.769
I haven't been
in the basement today.

39:55.079 --> 39:56.080
Mr. Dent?

39:59.316 --> 40:02.386
Mr. Dent,
are you ready to proceed?

40:02.419 --> 40:05.688
Uh, yes.
Yes, your honor. Thank you.

40:05.722 --> 40:07.224
<i>Murderer.</i>

40:07.258 --> 40:08.359
What?

40:12.062 --> 40:15.732
I asked if you're ready,
Mr. Dent.

40:15.766 --> 40:18.369
Yes, of course.

40:19.904 --> 40:23.740
Mr. Maroni, you have
confessed to 19 counts...

40:23.774 --> 40:24.775
<i>Confess.</i>

40:30.848 --> 40:31.882
What the hell is he...

40:31.916 --> 40:35.386
He's here, captain. The roof.

40:35.419 --> 40:39.256
Mr. District attorney,
we are all waiting.

40:39.290 --> 40:42.059
Uh, yes, yes. Sorry, your honor.

40:46.997 --> 40:49.066
Rooftop really necessary?

40:49.099 --> 40:51.101
I thought you'd want privacy.

40:51.135 --> 40:53.204
Harvey's starting
to lose it down there.

40:53.237 --> 40:56.240
I think all this holiday speculation
in the press is finally getting to...

40:57.274 --> 40:59.810
Privacy? Why?

41:03.847 --> 41:04.949
Where'd you find them?

41:06.050 --> 41:07.284
You're not going to like it.

41:09.486 --> 41:11.055
Uh, yeah.

41:11.088 --> 41:13.057
I hit Frankie gazzo
and his brother Lenny.

41:13.090 --> 41:15.526
Tossed their bodies
in the Gotham river.

41:15.559 --> 41:18.462
Lots of wise guys you're
looking for are in there.

41:18.495 --> 41:22.032
Maybe that's why I got an ulcer.
You know, from drinking the water?

41:27.004 --> 41:29.173
And didn't you commit
these murders and felonies

41:29.206 --> 41:33.310
under direct orders from
carmine "the Roman" Falcone?

41:36.146 --> 41:39.049
Felonies? Nah, guy's a Saint.

42:03.040 --> 42:04.341
- <i>Now.</i>
- Now.

42:07.044 --> 42:08.178
You okay, dent?

42:09.380 --> 42:10.547
What is it, heartburn?

42:11.448 --> 42:12.950
Happy to share.

42:14.018 --> 42:15.352
Now, Mr. Maroni,

42:15.386 --> 42:17.454
may I remind you
that your immunity

42:17.488 --> 42:20.858
is contingent upon your truthful
testimony during these proceedings.

42:20.891 --> 42:24.128
And I told you the truth.
Falcone is clean as a whistle.

42:28.932 --> 42:31.035
Sal, what are you doing?

42:31.068 --> 42:32.169
What I'm told.

42:34.171 --> 42:36.440
Okay.

42:36.473 --> 42:39.443
- Um, your honor, in light of the witness's...
- <i>Double cross!</i>

42:39.476 --> 42:43.280
Change of heart,
I need to request a continuance.

42:43.314 --> 42:47.084
Continuance? Uh. What is that?
Like, uh, a holiday?

42:47.117 --> 42:48.619
- What?
- <i>Holiday.</i>

42:48.652 --> 42:50.854
You know, like father's day.

42:53.424 --> 42:55.492
Luigi maroni sends his regards.

42:55.526 --> 42:56.894
<i>Go.</i>

43:03.167 --> 43:04.535
Bailiff, detain the witness!

43:05.602 --> 43:07.338
You're dead, holiday!

43:07.371 --> 43:09.039
You hear me, dent?

43:09.073 --> 43:11.909
That stuff will
eat through concrete!

43:16.480 --> 43:19.216
- Harvey!
- My god. Call an ambulance!

43:42.940 --> 43:46.176
<i>Idiots. They think it's you.</i>

43:46.210 --> 43:48.879
Who are you?

43:50.381 --> 43:52.316
<i>You know who I am.</i>

43:54.451 --> 43:56.086
No, I...

43:56.120 --> 43:58.422
<i>You sound tired.</i>

43:58.455 --> 44:00.290
<i>Why not let me take the wheel?</i>

44:01.392 --> 44:05.996
I don't know what's happening.

44:06.029 --> 44:08.532
<i>I'm sorry no one told you, harv.</i>

44:08.565 --> 44:10.200
Told me what?

44:11.168 --> 44:12.569
You're dead.

44:19.610 --> 44:21.145
I have to take this.

44:24.515 --> 44:25.949
Yeah.

44:27.217 --> 44:29.052
Now?

44:30.120 --> 44:32.289
No, it's the perfect time.

44:34.258 --> 44:38.395
The doctor says he'll be fine
in a few days. Don't worry.

44:38.429 --> 44:42.433
Oh, my god, he's gone.

44:42.466 --> 44:45.002
Secure the exits.
He couldn't have gotten far. Let's go!

45:08.192 --> 45:10.727
Well, where is...

45:13.163 --> 45:16.133
Let me guess.
You're not coming after all.

45:16.166 --> 45:17.701
<i>Afraid not.</i>

45:17.734 --> 45:21.438
Yeah. You're not really
one to get your hands dirty.

45:21.472 --> 45:23.073
<i>You know nothing about me.</i>

45:23.106 --> 45:28.111
I know you're a liar,
a thief, a murderer.

45:28.145 --> 45:29.480
<i>A father.</i>

45:33.550 --> 45:35.686
- A coward.
- <i>Goodbye, dent.</i>

45:39.590 --> 45:41.124
Fine.

45:42.226 --> 45:44.161
He wants to talk to you.

46:21.465 --> 46:23.700
Come on, come on.

46:30.474 --> 46:32.376
Really?

46:45.790 --> 46:48.525
It's not personal.
It's business.

47:07.344 --> 47:08.813
Happy birthday, poppa!

47:11.615 --> 47:14.184
All right, here we go.

47:18.355 --> 47:22.159
What a wonderful night.
Thank you.

47:22.192 --> 47:24.796
This year has been a trying one.

47:24.829 --> 47:27.230
And while we have
yet to fully dismantle

47:27.264 --> 47:30.835
the vicious machine
the law has set against us,

47:30.868 --> 47:33.637
you might say
we put a dent in it.

47:40.544 --> 47:45.282
To Sofia Falcone,
for brokering the peace with maroni.

47:45.315 --> 47:46.350
<i>Mille grazie.</i>

47:49.419 --> 47:51.756
And my beautiful sister, Carla.

47:51.789 --> 47:53.825
Where is she? Carla?

47:58.662 --> 48:00.397
Probably more TV interviews.

48:03.868 --> 48:06.938
Now, now.
Those interviews helped.

48:06.971 --> 48:08.405
I think she's got a future.

48:35.232 --> 48:37.501
Sorry to startle you.

48:40.337 --> 48:43.306
Shouldn't you be
looking for Harvey?

48:43.340 --> 48:46.844
I'm narrowing down his location
by interviewing known associates.

48:49.646 --> 48:52.182
Known associ... oh...

48:53.517 --> 48:55.552
Well, you're wasting your time.

48:55.585 --> 49:00.257
The man's a mystery.
Or so it would seem.

49:00.290 --> 49:02.894
Did you notice any recent
changes in his behavior?

49:02.927 --> 49:05.462
Mood swings?

49:05.495 --> 49:07.364
Is that so strange
when you deal with people

49:07.397 --> 49:08.732
like Falcone every day?

49:11.635 --> 49:14.204
Harvey never mentioned
he went to Oxford.

49:18.442 --> 49:19.609
Is it important?

49:20.812 --> 49:21.812
Maybe.

49:24.015 --> 49:26.951
This doesn't feel
like just a job for you.

49:26.984 --> 49:29.286
It's personal. Why?

49:31.455 --> 49:33.958
He's my friend,
and he needs help.

49:56.646 --> 49:58.015
Dinner time already?

50:02.586 --> 50:05.555
Solomon grundy

50:05.589 --> 50:09.326
born on a Monday.

50:09.359 --> 50:13.597
Christened on a Tuesday,
married on a Wednesday,

50:13.630 --> 50:19.302
ill on Thursday,
worse on Friday.

50:19.336 --> 50:21.471
Died on Saturday.

50:21.505 --> 50:22.739
Buried on Sunday.

50:24.809 --> 50:26.543
That was the end.

50:29.080 --> 50:31.783
Born on a Monday.

50:39.056 --> 50:42.292
Reborn, resurrected.

50:43.593 --> 50:45.428
On a Monday.

50:46.530 --> 50:49.033
Is that what happened to you?

50:49.066 --> 50:50.868
Did you die and come back?

50:55.438 --> 50:58.441
Can a man live two lives?

50:58.475 --> 51:02.079
Born on a Monday.

51:06.784 --> 51:09.419
Born on a Monday.

51:15.860 --> 51:19.063
Thirty days hath September.

51:19.096 --> 51:23.100
But today's the one
that troubles you the most.

51:23.134 --> 51:25.036
Where is he?

51:25.069 --> 51:26.503
It's been months.

51:28.940 --> 51:31.108
I've missed you.

51:31.142 --> 51:34.011
The da who was attacked and maimed
before vanishing from the hospital.

51:34.045 --> 51:36.546
Hm, he does that.

51:36.580 --> 51:40.885
Later that night, Carla viti, who'd
publicly accused dent of being holiday,

51:40.918 --> 51:43.386
was killed on her way to her
brother's birthday party.

51:44.454 --> 51:47.792
I know. Wasn't that terrible?

51:47.825 --> 51:49.894
I think she was right.

51:49.927 --> 51:52.462
Of course you do.

51:52.495 --> 51:56.566
It seems everyone who comes
after dent winds up dead.

51:56.600 --> 51:59.736
We need to find Harvey
before he kills again.

52:00.637 --> 52:02.907
What do you know?

52:02.940 --> 52:09.046
Gordon and his men have been here
day after day asking the same thing.

52:09.080 --> 52:12.049
I'll tell you
what I told the captain.

52:12.083 --> 52:16.087
Let me walk out of here
and I'll stop the killing.

52:18.022 --> 52:19.522
We're done.

52:23.227 --> 52:26.197
It's labor day.

52:26.230 --> 52:29.733
And, if the pattern holds,

52:29.767 --> 52:34.604
I believe you have
something holiday wants.

52:37.775 --> 52:39.643
Head north on atwell.

52:39.676 --> 52:42.780
- Sir, the penitentiary is south...
- I know where it is.

52:42.813 --> 52:45.682
This is the longest goddamn
prisoner transfer I've ever seen.

52:47.885 --> 52:49.787
Guess you guys
just can't get enough of me.

53:38.035 --> 53:41.504
Dent! You're alive?

53:41.538 --> 53:44.574
He's no longer
running this operation.

53:44.607 --> 53:49.046
All right... that's enough.

53:49.080 --> 53:53.050
Relax, Jim, I'm not
here to kill maroni.

53:53.084 --> 53:57.721
I'm here to thank him
for giving me a new... outlook.

53:58.889 --> 54:02.625
Oh, my god. Harvey...

54:02.659 --> 54:08.065
I have to tell you, jimbo,
your gun has come in handy.

54:08.099 --> 54:12.837
I know it was meant for Harvey,
but possession is nine-tenths.

54:15.739 --> 54:17.640
If you're not Harvey,
then, who are you?

54:18.209 --> 54:20.077
Holiday?

54:20.111 --> 54:21.946
We found the guns
in your basement.

54:23.180 --> 54:25.950
You found the guns
in my basement?

54:28.252 --> 54:29.686
Of course.

54:30.653 --> 54:32.857
We know everything.

54:32.890 --> 54:34.234
We just wanna
take you to get help.

54:34.258 --> 54:37.594
I think Thomas Wayne
was onto something.

54:37.627 --> 54:40.031
You can't beat 'em, jimbo,
not your way.

54:40.965 --> 54:42.133
Join 'em first.

54:43.968 --> 54:45.970
Then beat 'em
on their own terms.

54:47.138 --> 54:49.572
Heads, you die.

54:58.816 --> 55:01.185
It is up to you, Harvey.

55:01.218 --> 55:03.821
You and I know that both sides
of that coin are heads.

55:04.822 --> 55:06.223
How the hell could you...

55:08.192 --> 55:11.929
Oh, nice outfit, bats.

55:11.962 --> 55:14.765
I suppose this little trap
was your idea.

55:14.799 --> 55:17.034
Drop the gun, now!

55:36.387 --> 55:37.620
No!

55:47.131 --> 55:49.599
Come on, grundy, move your ass.

56:03.447 --> 56:05.916
I think we're
back to square one.

56:28.172 --> 56:29.773
Ah, you're up early.

56:30.174 --> 56:31.741
Hm?

56:31.775 --> 56:34.011
Oh, no, I just got in.

56:35.446 --> 56:38.382
Of course. Then I suppose
it's off to bed with you.

56:41.751 --> 56:44.231
- Is there something I can help...
- How did it happen, Alfred?

56:48.225 --> 56:50.761
Were they forced into
business with the falcones?

56:52.463 --> 56:54.731
Or were they so set
on building a legacy

56:54.765 --> 56:56.733
that they'd work
with the devil himself?

57:02.306 --> 57:06.043
Your parents believed that there are
two ways to look at everything...

57:08.979 --> 57:10.381
And everyone.

57:12.449 --> 57:14.051
Only two?

57:14.084 --> 57:16.787
They were young.
Two exceptionally good people

57:16.820 --> 57:19.757
living in
an exceptionally bad place,

57:19.790 --> 57:20.891
trying to make it better.

57:21.892 --> 57:23.761
But Falcone?

57:23.794 --> 57:25.372
Didn't they know that
by legitimizing him,

57:25.396 --> 57:27.364
they were helping
to make a monster?

57:27.398 --> 57:29.200
They made difficult choices

57:29.233 --> 57:30.901
and more than a few mistakes.

57:32.169 --> 57:34.104
But they were willing
to pay for them.

57:36.440 --> 57:40.878
I've always told myself that I'm
doing what I do to honor them.

57:40.911 --> 57:45.282
What does it mean if deep down,
I'm really doing it to redeem them?

57:48.152 --> 57:50.321
I think it means
your parents would be proud...

57:52.423 --> 57:54.225
Of their real legacy.

58:04.034 --> 58:05.034
This is absurd.

58:06.570 --> 58:10.107
Sorry for the inconvenience,
ma'am, but it's Halloween.

58:10.140 --> 58:14.144
- Mr. Dent is still at large.
- And captain Gordon ordered us to be here.

58:14.178 --> 58:15.879
So, you're stuck with us.

58:16.847 --> 58:19.383
You've blocked in my car.

58:19.416 --> 58:22.419
We're more than happy to drive
you anywhere you need to go.

58:22.453 --> 58:25.489
Though you'll be making our jobs a
lot easier if you remain indoors.

58:25.522 --> 58:28.225
There's no way to know where or
when your husband will show up.

58:29.193 --> 58:30.861
My husband is dead.

58:34.064 --> 58:36.500
I'm sorry, ma'am,
but that's not true.

58:38.369 --> 58:39.436
Yes, it is.

58:58.589 --> 59:00.057
Wake up, Julian.

59:01.058 --> 59:02.993
You know what today is.

59:06.597 --> 59:09.933
It's all hallows' Eve...

59:09.967 --> 59:14.071
The 31st day of the tenth month,

59:14.104 --> 59:19.910
and the 305th
of this miserable leap year.

59:21.545 --> 59:23.080
And...

59:26.650 --> 59:28.585
Taco Tuesday.

59:29.486 --> 59:31.121
<i>Muy bueno.</i>

59:31.155 --> 59:33.357
What the hell?

59:56.613 --> 59:58.916
Trick or treat.

1:00:01.919 --> 1:00:04.321
Attacking us like that
out in the open...

1:00:06.190 --> 1:00:07.558
It didn't fit the profile.

1:00:08.959 --> 1:00:10.627
So it was a hired gun.

1:00:10.661 --> 1:00:14.031
We see dent and holiday in the
same place at the same time,

1:00:14.064 --> 1:00:17.034
and, just like that, the da
has got himself an alibi.

1:00:19.570 --> 1:00:21.171
Did Harvey study at Oxford?

1:00:21.205 --> 1:00:23.073
Like Falcone's boy?

1:00:23.107 --> 1:00:26.543
I see where you're going but
don't let Harvey hear you say it.

1:00:26.577 --> 1:00:29.513
He's a Gotham u man.
A dyed-in-the-wool nighthawk.

1:00:30.547 --> 1:00:32.116
Don't get hung up on it.

1:00:34.385 --> 1:00:37.054
Not every lead checks out.

1:00:37.087 --> 1:00:40.457
And we already have
what we need to make our case.

1:00:40.491 --> 1:00:42.659
It's hard to believe the man
who stood on this roof

1:00:42.693 --> 1:00:47.631
and made that promise, that bond with
each of us, would cross the line.

1:00:47.664 --> 1:00:52.369
Can you honestly say that man and the
one we met in the alley were the same?

1:00:52.403 --> 1:00:57.508
There are deep scars there...
And I'm not talking about his face.

1:00:57.541 --> 1:01:00.411
If you think we're wrong,
find the evidence.

1:01:00.444 --> 1:01:03.981
But, for now, the best way
to save lives,

1:01:04.014 --> 1:01:06.250
including Harvey's,
is to bring him in.

1:01:31.341 --> 1:01:33.510
Do you know what my people
call this past year?

1:01:35.546 --> 1:01:37.214
The long Halloween.

1:01:37.714 --> 1:01:39.116
My nephew,

1:01:40.083 --> 1:01:42.686
my son, my sister,

1:01:43.654 --> 1:01:45.155
half my men...

1:01:47.724 --> 1:01:48.724
Why?

1:01:50.227 --> 1:01:52.296
Why would dent kill your son?

1:01:56.433 --> 1:01:59.503
I wish I had the chance to be
a better father to my boy.

1:02:01.038 --> 1:02:02.473
We will never
see each other again.

1:02:04.776 --> 1:02:05.776
For that,

1:02:06.643 --> 1:02:07.643
I am so...

1:02:10.314 --> 1:02:11.314
So sorry.

1:02:17.454 --> 1:02:20.491
There is a rule among my kind.

1:02:20.524 --> 1:02:22.326
We leave the wives out of it,

1:02:23.594 --> 1:02:26.764
but dent does not play
by our rules.

1:02:29.299 --> 1:02:32.169
And when that happens,
he will die.

1:02:33.237 --> 1:02:34.271
Whose wives?

1:02:37.407 --> 1:02:39.376
I guess justice really is blind.

1:02:51.221 --> 1:02:52.222
Poppa.

1:02:52.256 --> 1:02:53.724
Everything is fine, Sofia.

1:02:53.758 --> 1:02:55.392
I just stumbled.

1:03:05.302 --> 1:03:07.271
That wasn't necessary.

1:03:07.304 --> 1:03:09.373
Maybe not.

1:03:09.406 --> 1:03:11.742
Are you going to tell me why
you're so obsessed with them?

1:03:26.156 --> 1:03:28.458
I never thanked you
for finding me

1:03:28.492 --> 1:03:30.327
and getting me home that night.

1:03:31.595 --> 1:03:33.397
You thought I was your mother.

1:03:33.430 --> 1:03:34.731
Scarecrow's fear toxin.

1:03:38.402 --> 1:03:41.204
Where you found me
is where I lost her.

1:03:47.244 --> 1:03:49.079
I don't even know
my mother's name.

1:03:50.514 --> 1:03:53.584
But I think there's someone
who can tell me.

1:03:59.256 --> 1:04:00.256
Your father.

1:04:02.426 --> 1:04:03.426
Are you sure?

1:04:04.294 --> 1:04:05.596
When the time comes,

1:04:05.629 --> 1:04:08.732
I'm not sure
I'll have it in me to ask.

1:04:08.766 --> 1:04:11.401
Is there even such a thing

1:04:11.435 --> 1:04:12.870
as a normal family in this city?

1:04:13.670 --> 1:04:14.772
Maybe not...

1:04:15.639 --> 1:04:16.774
For people like us.

1:04:31.321 --> 1:04:32.321
What the hell is that?

1:04:33.958 --> 1:04:35.692
Oh, shit!

1:04:38.662 --> 1:04:41.732
<i>All units,
10-33 at the corner of 6th and Mason.</i>

1:04:41.766 --> 1:04:43.634
<i>All available units respond.</i>

1:04:47.905 --> 1:04:51.174
No, captain said we don't leave
for anything, not tonight.

1:05:24.708 --> 1:05:27.577
<i>♪ Pop goes the weasel ♪</i>

1:05:32.884 --> 1:05:36.954
Keep coming, boys.
Everyone's invited to this party.

1:05:37.855 --> 1:05:40.624
Not everyone.

1:05:48.598 --> 1:05:52.369
Head. I meant heads!

1:05:56.406 --> 1:05:57.674
Sofia, please.

1:05:57.708 --> 1:05:59.443
It was nothing.

1:05:59.476 --> 1:06:00.878
Stop treating me
like an old man.

1:06:01.846 --> 1:06:02.846
You're not old.

1:06:06.616 --> 1:06:08.652
Maybe I am...

1:06:08.685 --> 1:06:10.420
Too old for this business,
at least.

1:06:16.727 --> 1:06:19.229
Have you...
Heard from your mother?

1:06:20.697 --> 1:06:21.732
She loves you.

1:06:22.800 --> 1:06:24.267
Just not this place.

1:06:25.770 --> 1:06:26.971
This place is me.

1:06:28.873 --> 1:06:30.875
I know you think that

1:06:30.908 --> 1:06:33.343
and maybe at one time it was.

1:06:34.478 --> 1:06:35.679
But things have changed,

1:06:36.446 --> 1:06:37.481
so much...

1:06:38.749 --> 1:06:39.851
So fast.

1:06:41.018 --> 1:06:42.385
Haven't I changed with them?

1:06:43.788 --> 1:06:45.489
Yes, you have.

1:06:45.522 --> 1:06:47.624
But when you were coming up

1:06:47.657 --> 1:06:49.726
when mama was here,

1:06:49.761 --> 1:06:52.629
you wouldn't have thought to hire
freaks like poison Ivy and scarecrow.

1:06:53.798 --> 1:06:55.867
These... people,

1:06:57.101 --> 1:06:58.635
they're not stable, poppa.

1:07:02.472 --> 1:07:03.473
Times change.

1:07:06.476 --> 1:07:07.845
<i>Boss!</i>

1:07:07.879 --> 1:07:09.546
<i>Something's wrong downstairs.</i>

1:07:09.579 --> 1:07:11.314
<i>The cops took off</i>

1:07:11.348 --> 1:07:12.960
<i>and we can't get any
of our guys on the comm.</i>

1:07:12.984 --> 1:07:13.984
Maron...

1:07:50.121 --> 1:07:51.321
Sofia, no!

1:08:07.537 --> 1:08:09.040
Come on, you mother...

1:08:29.726 --> 1:08:30.962
Sofia!

1:09:13.037 --> 1:09:14.037
What is this?

1:09:19.509 --> 1:09:21.178
Judgment day.

1:09:28.085 --> 1:09:29.987
We lost them in the sewers.

1:09:30.021 --> 1:09:33.057
You're right.
This was meant to distract us.

1:09:33.090 --> 1:09:36.027
Yeah, but distract us from what?

1:09:41.032 --> 1:09:44.201
I really
owe it all to you, carmine.

1:09:44.235 --> 1:09:47.772
You've taught me
that all men are guilty...

1:09:49.639 --> 1:09:52.509
And innocent.

1:09:52.542 --> 1:09:54.711
Which makes justice nothing more

1:09:54.744 --> 1:09:56.047
than the flip of a coin.

1:09:57.782 --> 1:09:59.083
The outcome unpredictable.

1:10:00.017 --> 1:10:02.552
That is, of course...

1:10:02.585 --> 1:10:08.125
Unless the system is corrupted,
rigged in a man's favor.

1:10:08.159 --> 1:10:12.629
Legit businessman/philanthropist
by day.

1:10:12.662 --> 1:10:17.034
Criminal racketeer,
murderer by night.

1:10:17.068 --> 1:10:19.904
You've rigged every game
you've ever played

1:10:19.937 --> 1:10:22.773
in your business
and your family.

1:10:24.674 --> 1:10:27.812
It's really the most minor
of adjustments,

1:10:27.845 --> 1:10:31.548
a small change of outlook
that decides if you live...

1:10:32.582 --> 1:10:33.650
Or not.

1:10:42.093 --> 1:10:44.061
Just pull the fucking trigger.

1:10:46.163 --> 1:10:47.664
You haven't listened.

1:10:47.697 --> 1:10:50.201
If you had, you'd understand

1:10:50.234 --> 1:10:52.535
that for the first time,
carmine,

1:10:52.569 --> 1:10:54.038
it really isn't up to me.

1:10:54.872 --> 1:10:56.007
Good luck.

1:11:04.782 --> 1:11:05.782
No!

1:12:03.874 --> 1:12:06.743
<i>En garde,</i>
you sanctimonious shit...

1:12:06.777 --> 1:12:07.845
Ow!

1:12:23.294 --> 1:12:26.997
Nancy, hold all my calls.

1:12:27.031 --> 1:12:29.834
I have to terminate someone.

1:12:49.420 --> 1:12:50.420
Harvey, don't!

1:13:16.113 --> 1:13:18.648
Alone at last.

1:13:20.184 --> 1:13:22.219
Now let's get you
out of all this.

1:13:37.968 --> 1:13:39.069
Stay back.

1:13:49.947 --> 1:13:51.182
Harvey.

1:13:51.215 --> 1:13:52.816
You don't have to do this.

1:13:53.884 --> 1:13:56.820
Harvey, Harvey, Harvey.

1:13:56.854 --> 1:13:59.456
Can't you see
I'm a new man, bats?

1:13:59.490 --> 1:14:01.025
I'm finally awake.

1:14:02.293 --> 1:14:03.961
And, unlike Harvey dent,

1:14:03.994 --> 1:14:07.431
I'm not beholden
to petty motives like revenge,

1:14:07.464 --> 1:14:10.901
or, worse, career advancement.

1:14:11.902 --> 1:14:13.904
A weight has been lifted.

1:14:13.938 --> 1:14:16.307
I don't have to decide
who's innocent

1:14:16.340 --> 1:14:18.409
and who's guilty anymore.

1:14:18.442 --> 1:14:20.044
All I have to do

1:14:20.811 --> 1:14:23.147
is... execute.

1:14:28.219 --> 1:14:29.353
- Guilty.
- No!

1:14:29.386 --> 1:14:30.854
No!

1:14:43.801 --> 1:14:44.835
Poppa.

1:14:46.370 --> 1:14:47.370
Sofia, no!

1:14:55.379 --> 1:14:56.447
Two bullets only.

1:14:57.214 --> 1:14:59.350
Sorry, gorgeous.

1:14:59.383 --> 1:15:03.320
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1:15:15.199 --> 1:15:16.834
Sofia.

1:15:20.170 --> 1:15:23.073
I can't... I can't hold on.

1:16:01.645 --> 1:16:03.280
Louisa?

1:16:04.515 --> 1:16:05.515
Louisa.

1:16:12.189 --> 1:16:13.524
Selina.

1:16:16.593 --> 1:16:19.830
- Selina?
- Let me help you.

1:16:21.365 --> 1:16:22.399
No.

1:16:23.067 --> 1:16:24.101
No.

1:16:25.536 --> 1:16:28.572
All we get is all we take.

1:16:30.074 --> 1:16:31.475
Do you still believe?

1:16:32.609 --> 1:16:34.111
Yes...

1:16:34.144 --> 1:16:35.512
I do.

1:16:37.514 --> 1:16:38.514
Good.

1:17:09.546 --> 1:17:10.981
Harvey?

1:17:11.014 --> 1:17:12.014
Not anymore.

1:17:16.453 --> 1:17:17.921
It had to be done.

1:17:19.523 --> 1:17:21.091
You will never
convince me of that.

1:17:22.726 --> 1:17:24.928
There won't be
any judges to be bribed.

1:17:26.029 --> 1:17:27.598
No witnesses to disappear.

1:17:29.099 --> 1:17:32.169
The Roman is dead
and two-face killed him.

1:17:34.338 --> 1:17:36.173
The long Halloween...

1:17:37.307 --> 1:17:38.308
Is over.

1:17:41.645 --> 1:17:42.646
We'll get you help.

1:17:45.516 --> 1:17:49.353
You're the ones who're gonna
need help from now on.

1:17:51.355 --> 1:17:52.990
Harvey...

1:17:53.023 --> 1:17:56.393
Two-face... whatever.

1:17:56.427 --> 1:17:58.429
You betrayed everything
you believe in.

1:18:00.297 --> 1:18:01.432
Not everything.

1:18:07.271 --> 1:18:08.405
Arrest me, jimbo.

1:18:10.307 --> 1:18:12.409
I'm responsible.

1:18:12.443 --> 1:18:16.280
Not just for Falcone,
but all the holiday killings.

1:18:18.449 --> 1:18:20.517
I have to face judgment.

1:18:31.796 --> 1:18:32.796
The cost.

1:18:34.731 --> 1:18:38.502
The promise we made
right here, one year ago

1:18:38.535 --> 1:18:43.974
to take down the Roman.
In the end... was it worth it?

1:18:45.777 --> 1:18:48.445
He's asking
if the good guys won.

1:18:48.479 --> 1:18:51.448
Yes, the good guys won.

1:18:51.482 --> 1:18:53.317
But we won't know
for a very long time

1:18:53.350 --> 1:18:54.351
if it was worth it.

1:19:28.352 --> 1:19:29.686
Gilda.

1:19:48.472 --> 1:19:49.472
It had to be done.

1:19:50.440 --> 1:19:52.142
You know that.

1:19:52.175 --> 1:19:55.612
The same way you knew Harvey
never went to Oxford.

1:19:56.680 --> 1:19:57.680
That was me.

1:19:58.850 --> 1:19:59.850
Well,

1:20:00.551 --> 1:20:01.752
me and...

1:20:03.353 --> 1:20:05.088
Alberto Falcone.

1:20:06.690 --> 1:20:09.059
If you could see
how in love we were then.

1:20:11.161 --> 1:20:12.663
I was pregnant.

1:20:12.696 --> 1:20:14.565
He didn't hesitate.

1:20:14.598 --> 1:20:16.133
We were married that same day.

1:20:18.235 --> 1:20:21.338
He was heir to the Roman empire.

1:20:21.371 --> 1:20:24.107
And his father could never
welcome into the family

1:20:24.141 --> 1:20:26.310
a child
conceived out of wedlock.

1:20:28.145 --> 1:20:29.680
I tried to fight.

1:20:29.713 --> 1:20:31.381
But what chance
did I have opposite

1:20:31.415 --> 1:20:32.482
the godfather of Gotham?

1:20:36.788 --> 1:20:38.589
Against my will,

1:20:38.622 --> 1:20:40.758
our marriage was annulled
and our child

1:20:41.692 --> 1:20:43.293
ripped from my womb.

1:20:45.763 --> 1:20:46.764
What they did to me...

1:20:48.498 --> 1:20:49.733
The way it was done...

1:20:51.635 --> 1:20:52.770
Left me broken.

1:20:54.605 --> 1:20:55.873
You wanted revenge.

1:20:59.276 --> 1:21:00.878
I wanted justice.

1:21:00.912 --> 1:21:03.180
I came to Gotham and married
the man I thought

1:21:03.213 --> 1:21:06.383
had the best chance
of delivering it.

1:21:06.416 --> 1:21:10.454
Oh... Harvey and I
were so much alike,

1:21:10.487 --> 1:21:14.157
only what was inside him
hadn't yet been ripped out.

1:21:15.692 --> 1:21:18.395
That was... useful.

1:21:20.932 --> 1:21:22.199
And...

1:21:23.467 --> 1:21:26.804
Even fun for a time.

1:21:26.838 --> 1:21:29.907
But then he became so busy
wrestling his own demon,

1:21:29.941 --> 1:21:34.211
I was left to take down mine
all by myself.

1:21:36.613 --> 1:21:41.886
One holiday, one twisted family
snapshot at a time.

1:21:45.823 --> 1:21:48.659
I have no regrets about
what I did to the Roman,

1:21:48.692 --> 1:21:50.795
or his son,

1:21:50.828 --> 1:21:53.463
or anyone else in that
godforsaken family.

1:21:56.266 --> 1:21:57.769
But Harvey,

1:21:57.802 --> 1:22:00.170
in the end, I loved him.

1:22:03.707 --> 1:22:05.208
But not all of him.

1:22:07.411 --> 1:22:08.813
So...

1:22:08.846 --> 1:22:11.581
Are you going to
take me away or just...

1:22:11.615 --> 1:22:12.784
Stand there in judgment?

1:22:15.252 --> 1:22:17.889
I need to know
that holiday is done.

1:22:19.957 --> 1:22:21.324
Not done...

1:22:22.526 --> 1:22:23.560
Finished.

1:22:31.401 --> 1:22:34.571
I wonder... how long
did he know about me?

1:22:36.473 --> 1:22:37.713
Is that how you figured it out?

1:22:38.709 --> 1:22:39.977
Did Harvey tip you off?

1:22:42.512 --> 1:22:43.580
He didn't give you up.

1:22:44.648 --> 1:22:45.649
Not knowingly.

1:22:47.350 --> 1:22:49.386
But after maroni was killed,

1:22:49.419 --> 1:22:53.490
the way he protected holiday,
he must have known then.

1:22:54.424 --> 1:22:55.492
He was my friend.

1:22:56.526 --> 1:22:57.526
He believed in me.

1:22:58.428 --> 1:22:59.428
I should have saved him.

1:23:01.032 --> 1:23:02.399
What will you do now?

1:23:04.035 --> 1:23:05.335
Tell Gordon?

1:23:26.057 --> 1:23:27.424
Alfred.

1:23:27.457 --> 1:23:29.426
Really?

1:23:29.459 --> 1:23:31.963
I know it's late, sir,
but you never know.

1:23:33.530 --> 1:23:34.999
It doesn't matter
how late it is.

1:23:35.032 --> 1:23:37.534
We don't get trick-or-treaters.

1:23:37.567 --> 1:23:40.437
Not all Gotham families
share your obstinate hope.

1:23:41.839 --> 1:23:43.740
It's going to take
a lot more good people

1:23:43.775 --> 1:23:47.410
trying to make things better
before we see real change.

1:23:50.480 --> 1:23:52.349
If you say so, sir.

1:23:56.854 --> 1:23:58.054
You're cute when you're wrong.

1:24:00.690 --> 1:24:01.690
Trick or treat.

1:26:54.664 --> 1:26:56.000
It's for you, sir.
