<i> Previously on</i> Wayward Pines...

00:03.771 --> 00:04.870
XANDER:<i> They just</i>
<i> got their leader back.</i>

00:04.872 --> 00:06.538
It's not a question
of "if" anymore.

00:06.540 --> 00:08.107
It's a question of "when."

00:08.109 --> 00:09.808
Our enemy has moved close.

00:09.810 --> 00:12.478
<i> In numbers</i>
<i> we've never seen before.</i>

00:12.480 --> 00:14.013
<i> We will go back to sleep</i>

00:14.015 --> 00:16.782
until the Abby threat
is contained.

00:16.784 --> 00:18.517
There's a problem with the pods.

00:18.519 --> 00:21.387
We can only take
roughly half the people.

00:21.389 --> 00:23.389
He's going to make
the selections right now.

00:23.391 --> 00:24.957
Take him out.

00:24.959 --> 00:26.892
I can't do that.

00:26.894 --> 00:28.360
And now here we are

00:28.362 --> 00:29.895
with a baby coming.

00:29.897 --> 00:31.463
That's what I want.

00:31.465 --> 00:34.066
And I think it's
what you want, too.

00:34.902 --> 00:37.202
JASON:
You had a child.

00:37.204 --> 00:40.539
The baby went to Texas.
It was 2,000 years ago.

00:40.541 --> 00:42.074
JASON:<i> How do you know</i>
<i> the baby went to Texas?</i>

00:42.076 --> 00:43.409
KERRY:
<i> What?</i>

00:43.411 --> 00:45.044
JASON:<i> How do you know</i>
<i> the baby went to Texas?!</i>

00:45.046 --> 00:46.879
What are you talking about?
Where's this coming from?

00:46.881 --> 00:47.846
How do you know?!

00:47.848 --> 00:49.815
(both grunting)

00:52.520 --> 00:54.086
(gunshot)

00:58.259 --> 01:00.426
We're gonna do
an emergency thoracotomy.

01:00.428 --> 01:02.594
I need an additional
surgical resident.

01:02.596 --> 01:04.396
Get me two O.R. nurses.

01:04.398 --> 01:06.532
OSCAR: That's a really
risky procedure, Doctor.

01:06.534 --> 01:09.101
He's gonna make it, right?
You can see...

01:09.103 --> 01:10.235
He's just another patient.

01:10.237 --> 01:11.236
No, he isn't.

01:11.238 --> 01:12.438
Go.

01:12.440 --> 01:14.440
Go.

01:14.442 --> 01:17.209
I need two nurses
in the O.R. stat!

01:17.211 --> 01:18.911

Only take with you

BP 70/40...

04:28.202 --> 04:30.302
Dr. Yedlin...
Control the bleeding, Oscar.

04:30.304 --> 04:32.304
It's in his lung.
(flatlining)

04:32.306 --> 04:34.640

05:09.109 --> 05:11.543

05:18.519 --> 05:21.086
I want everyone to go home.

05:21.088 --> 05:22.821
The evacuation has begun.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.756
We do not have much time.

05:24.758 --> 05:28.327
And you'll all be safe.

05:28.329 --> 05:29.961
I promise you.

05:29.963 --> 05:31.697
Despite all our efforts,

05:31.699 --> 05:35.200
Jason Higgins
died this morning.

05:35.202 --> 05:36.501
(crowd gasping, murmuring)

05:36.503 --> 05:38.270
Just a few minutes ago.

05:38.272 --> 05:41.139
Jason served this town

05:41.141 --> 05:44.009
as best as he knew how.

05:44.011 --> 05:47.979
And the best way to honor him

05:47.981 --> 05:51.049
is by fulfilling his wish.

05:51.051 --> 05:52.784
To survive.

05:52.786 --> 05:55.053
(crowd murmuring)

05:55.055 --> 05:57.456
We have an opportunity.

05:57.458 --> 05:59.291
Wayward Pines needs
strong leadership.

05:59.293 --> 06:02.127
No one here will dispute that,

06:02.129 --> 06:05.364
but what it doesn't need,
what it doesn't...

06:05.366 --> 06:07.999
deserve...

06:08.001 --> 06:09.568
is a dictator.

06:09.570 --> 06:11.870
I know

06:11.872 --> 06:14.906
that many of us
did not ask to be here.

06:14.908 --> 06:17.409
I know I didn't.

06:19.847 --> 06:22.481
But we're all that's left.

06:22.483 --> 06:24.583
And when we make it
to the other side of this--

06:24.585 --> 06:26.218
and we will--

06:26.220 --> 06:30.422
humanity begins anew

06:30.424 --> 06:32.891
with us.

06:32.893 --> 06:35.560
Because that's now our destiny.

06:38.031 --> 06:40.098
See you on the mountain.

06:40.100 --> 06:42.567
(crowd murmuring)

06:52.746 --> 06:54.179
You've updated
all the prescription records?

06:54.181 --> 06:55.280
On all but the maternity ward.

06:55.282 --> 06:56.681
The sutures on Mr. Welch,
they holding?

06:56.683 --> 06:57.883
They should be fine.

06:57.885 --> 06:59.050
I just wanted to say, sir,

06:59.052 --> 07:00.852
what you did in there
with Jason...

07:00.854 --> 07:03.655
(groans)
The pericardial tamponade.

07:06.527 --> 07:08.393
You didn't drain it first.

07:08.395 --> 07:11.463
You didn't
drain it at all.

07:14.067 --> 07:17.469
That's the first thing
you should've done, right?

07:17.471 --> 07:19.371
You never...

07:19.373 --> 07:21.640
make mistakes.

07:22.943 --> 07:25.544
Was it on purpose,
Dr. Yedlin?

07:27.281 --> 07:30.115
I did everything I could
to save the patient.

07:30.117 --> 07:32.684
I took all reasonable steps.

07:40.294 --> 07:43.395
You're gonna make an
excellent doctor, Oscar.

07:45.499 --> 07:47.966
Dr. Yedlin,
I-I just wanted to tell you

07:47.968 --> 07:50.235
what a wonderful little speech
you made out there.

07:50.237 --> 07:52.904
And I know you're very busy, but
I just wanted to confess to you

07:52.906 --> 07:56.274
I've had a lot of different
professionalities in my life.

07:56.276 --> 07:57.943
You mean jobs?

07:57.945 --> 07:59.811
Yes, jobs.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.480
I've been a tollbooth operator.

08:01.482 --> 08:03.648
I've been a hockey mascot.

08:03.650 --> 08:06.518
I've been an adult
bookstore manager.

08:06.520 --> 08:08.019
But of all those jobs,

08:08.021 --> 08:09.321
this has been
the most satisfying.

08:09.323 --> 08:10.856
I feel like I've really
made a difference.

08:10.858 --> 08:12.491
And it's all because

08:12.493 --> 08:13.692
of you.

08:13.694 --> 08:15.126
And I just want to say
I feel

08:15.128 --> 08:18.930
I can really make a difference
in the future.

08:18.932 --> 08:21.433
And I feel like together,
you and I

08:21.435 --> 08:22.934
could change humanity.

08:22.936 --> 08:24.669
Yeah.

08:24.671 --> 08:27.539
I will see you in the mountains.

08:27.541 --> 08:29.774
Tallyho.

08:31.612 --> 08:33.778
I will see you

08:33.780 --> 08:37.082
in the mountains.

08:49.296 --> 08:51.029
So I noticed
something interesting

08:51.031 --> 08:53.298
while doing
the paperwork.

08:54.801 --> 08:58.970
Jason's blood type
is AB negative.

08:58.972 --> 09:00.305
It's rare--
something like less

09:00.307 --> 09:02.707
than one percent
of the population.

09:02.709 --> 09:04.175
There were only four people

09:04.177 --> 09:05.877
awake in Wayward Pines
who have it.

09:05.879 --> 09:08.380
The first three are
his family, the Mansfields.

09:08.382 --> 09:10.849
But then the other one

09:10.851 --> 09:12.851
is Kerry Campbell.

09:12.853 --> 09:16.488
That's weird, right?

09:16.490 --> 09:17.756
Dr. Yedlin?

09:17.758 --> 09:20.258
CJ's waiting for you
in your office.

09:30.237 --> 09:31.736
THEO:
Impressive, huh?

09:33.407 --> 09:36.274
I think they're real.

09:36.276 --> 09:39.010
Yeah, well,
the evacuation has begun.

09:39.012 --> 09:41.580
The pods are almost ready.

09:41.582 --> 09:43.415
Easier for me if
we can put everyone

09:43.417 --> 09:45.617
into suspension
at the same time.

09:45.619 --> 09:48.587
I can explain to
you how it works.

09:48.589 --> 09:50.055
No, thanks.

09:50.057 --> 09:51.222
I've been in one.

09:51.224 --> 09:52.857
That's enough for me.
Good.

09:52.859 --> 09:55.093
'Cause I don't have six
months to teach you.

09:55.095 --> 09:56.795
The plan that Jason
commenced, uh,

09:56.797 --> 09:59.464
had us taking
intact family first.

09:59.466 --> 10:01.366
Both parents and
all the children.

10:01.368 --> 10:03.802
That accounts
for almost 300

10:03.804 --> 10:06.104
of the 571 pods
that are working.

10:06.106 --> 10:08.440
After that,
we take the children

10:08.442 --> 10:11.610
and leave behind the adults
who are nonessential.

10:11.612 --> 10:13.545
If there's any trouble,

10:13.547 --> 10:17.415
we'll be better
able to control it.

10:17.417 --> 10:20.285
You don't think
they deserve to know, CJ?

10:20.287 --> 10:21.886
They will know.

10:21.888 --> 10:24.723
But only after
the rest of us are safe.

10:26.259 --> 10:28.627
Here, the list.

10:32.332 --> 10:33.932
These were the
decisions Jason made

10:33.934 --> 10:36.401
about who would come
and who would stay.

10:36.403 --> 10:39.070
He made them quickly,
but he made decisions.

10:46.013 --> 10:48.513
You knew him as a boy.

10:50.017 --> 10:52.684
I did.

10:52.686 --> 10:55.086
But I did not know the
man he would become.

10:55.088 --> 10:56.154
He was never a man.

10:56.156 --> 10:57.689
He's in the past. I'm not sure

10:57.691 --> 10:59.791
there's any point
in arguing over him now.

10:59.793 --> 11:02.761
You have your own
decisions to make.

11:04.031 --> 11:05.864
Maybe some preferences
of your own?

11:05.866 --> 11:09.200
I said it should be random.

11:09.202 --> 11:10.835
That's impossible now.

11:10.837 --> 11:14.172
And the Abbies
could be here any minute.

11:14.174 --> 11:15.607
Maybe it's better to go with

11:15.609 --> 11:17.942
what was already organized
and in process.

11:17.944 --> 11:20.111
I mean, you can make
changes, of course.

11:20.113 --> 11:24.182
There are over 300 people who
have never been woken at all.

11:25.352 --> 11:27.218
You could wake some of them

11:27.220 --> 11:28.787
to free up some extra pods.

11:28.789 --> 11:31.056
But for every action,

11:31.058 --> 11:34.292
there's an equal,
opposite reaction.

11:34.294 --> 11:37.696
You're not only choosing
who to bring,

11:37.698 --> 11:40.131
but you're choosing
who to now leave behind.

11:41.501 --> 11:43.401
You will be granting a pardon

11:43.403 --> 11:44.836
and a death sentence

11:44.838 --> 11:47.138
at the same time.

11:58.418 --> 11:59.984
Did he suffer?

11:59.986 --> 12:02.887
Did you want him to?

12:04.091 --> 12:05.824
I don't know.

12:07.160 --> 12:08.727
Well, a pod just opened up.

12:10.864 --> 12:12.831
You think this is funny?

12:12.833 --> 12:15.667
You were always the brains
behind that tyrannical moron.

12:15.669 --> 12:18.002
He wasn't a tyrant.

12:18.004 --> 12:20.038
He was doing
what he thought was right.

12:20.040 --> 12:22.373
Right.

12:22.375 --> 12:23.842
(scoffs)

12:23.844 --> 12:25.577
In a place
where everything's wrong.

12:27.114 --> 12:29.214
It's rotten.

12:29.216 --> 12:31.683
It's all a lie.

12:31.685 --> 12:35.186
There's been enough lies,
Dr. Yedlin.

12:35.188 --> 12:37.889
I'm only interested
in the truth.

12:37.891 --> 12:39.190
Yeah.

12:42.696 --> 12:44.696
Incidentally...

12:44.698 --> 12:46.631
you know Pilcher
changed your file, right?

12:46.633 --> 12:47.899
I know that.

12:47.901 --> 12:49.400
Did you also know

12:49.402 --> 12:51.703
that Jason was placed in a pod

12:51.705 --> 12:53.304
just days after being born?

12:53.306 --> 12:56.040
And, coincidentally,

12:56.042 --> 12:59.344
you arrived here
days after giving birth.

13:00.547 --> 13:02.580
And you both
share a...

13:02.582 --> 13:05.450
a very rare blood type.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.952
A<i> very</i> rare
blood type.

13:34.815 --> 13:36.681
(Margaret screaming)

13:39.186 --> 13:41.252
(Abbies snarling)

13:51.598 --> 13:53.998
(screams)

14:16.523 --> 14:19.290
WOMAN (over P.A.): Please
proceed in an orderly fashion.

14:19.292 --> 14:22.060
All families will be
processed together.

14:22.062 --> 14:24.362
You will all go through
physical examination,

14:24.364 --> 14:26.798
then be fitted for your suit

14:26.800 --> 14:29.200
and led into the pod room.
Do not forget:

14:29.202 --> 14:31.536
you must have your
identification with you.

14:31.538 --> 14:34.572
Only residents
with proper identification

14:34.574 --> 14:37.475
may enter the pod room.

14:37.477 --> 14:41.346
MAN: One at a time,
please, one at a time.

14:41.348 --> 14:43.414
(vehicle approaching)

15:04.571 --> 15:07.505
293 people have moved
into the superstructure

15:07.507 --> 15:09.908
and are in processing.

15:09.910 --> 15:12.176
They've begun
to collect the rest.

15:20.220 --> 15:22.954
Are you all right?

15:22.956 --> 15:24.289
No.

15:28.962 --> 15:31.095
MAN (over speaker):
Residents of Wayward Pines,

15:31.097 --> 15:33.097
if you are not on
the initial shuttle lists,

15:33.099 --> 15:35.400
you must wait in your homes
for group two.

15:35.402 --> 15:37.268
Please be patient.

15:37.270 --> 15:39.704
The next shuttles
are departing soon.

15:47.213 --> 15:48.980
I'm sorry.

15:48.982 --> 15:50.748
You're not on the first list.

15:50.750 --> 15:52.817
We're taking people
up in two groups.

15:52.819 --> 15:54.585
We have to sequence
the people

15:54.587 --> 15:56.254
in the pod room
in a specific order.

15:56.256 --> 15:58.456
We'll be back shortly
for group two.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.124
CHILD:
Daddy?

16:00.126 --> 16:02.727
Ma'am. DALE: Don't be scared.

16:02.729 --> 16:04.662
Ma-Mama's going
to be there with you.

16:04.664 --> 16:06.998
I'll see you in a little bit,
okay?

16:07.000 --> 16:09.067
(car door closes)

16:09.069 --> 16:11.336
SOLDIER: All right, "A" bus is
leaving in two minutes, kids.

16:11.338 --> 16:13.571
Here we go, move along.

16:13.573 --> 16:15.440
Keep walking, guys.

16:15.442 --> 16:16.975
Hey, hey. Keep going.

16:16.977 --> 16:19.777
Single file line, single file.

16:19.779 --> 16:23.047
Everyone on the bus,
everyone on.

16:24.351 --> 16:27.018
Go, keep it moving.

16:28.688 --> 16:30.588
Frank?

16:31.925 --> 16:33.424
Frank!

16:42.268 --> 16:44.369
SOLDIER:
Let's go, everyone.

16:44.371 --> 16:45.603
What's happening?

16:45.605 --> 16:47.338
SOLDIER:
Keep moving.

16:48.608 --> 16:50.041
They told us
to wait here.

16:50.043 --> 16:52.543
They're taking people up
in two groups.

16:52.545 --> 16:53.845
We're group two.

16:53.847 --> 16:55.913
What's wrong with us?

16:57.350 --> 17:00.551
Nothing.

17:00.553 --> 17:02.553
They're coming back.

17:02.555 --> 17:06.624
My brother--
have you seen him?

17:06.626 --> 17:08.693
Frank!

17:12.198 --> 17:13.631
Frank Armstrong,
have you seen him?

17:13.633 --> 17:14.799
You're holding up
the line. Come on.

17:14.801 --> 17:16.034
No. Frank!
Let's go.

17:16.036 --> 17:18.002
Get on the bus.
(crying): Frank!

17:18.004 --> 17:19.637
Frank! Keep it moving. Come on.

17:20.974 --> 17:21.973
(yelling):
Frank!

17:21.975 --> 17:23.141
Frank!

17:24.210 --> 17:26.177
Frank! Frank!

17:26.179 --> 17:27.945
Lucy!

17:29.749 --> 17:30.982
Frank!
Lucy!

17:30.984 --> 17:32.050
Lucy!
Hey! Hey!

17:32.052 --> 17:33.651
Let go of me!
(crying): Frank!

17:33.653 --> 17:34.852
You're not on the list!
Frank!

17:34.854 --> 17:36.821
LUCY (crying): Frank. (groans)

17:39.359 --> 17:41.359
LUCY (crying):
Frank! No.

17:41.361 --> 17:43.227
Frank.

17:43.229 --> 17:45.496
Frank, no.

17:45.498 --> 17:47.765
Frank, no.

17:47.767 --> 17:50.068
No. I don't want to go!

17:50.070 --> 17:52.136
LUCY (crying):
No.

18:04.617 --> 18:06.851
Rebecca Yedlin?

18:08.088 --> 18:10.021
It's time to go.

18:21.534 --> 18:22.800
You need to wait here.

18:38.885 --> 18:40.251
What are you talking about? We're
taking people in two groups.

18:40.253 --> 18:41.285
We're one group;
we're married.

18:41.287 --> 18:42.553
It has something to do

18:42.555 --> 18:43.988
with the sequencing
in the pod room.

18:43.990 --> 18:45.456
Now if you'll come
with us, ma'am, please.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.391
I'm not going anywhere
without my husband.

18:47.393 --> 18:49.093
Rebecca. It's just
one more person.

18:49.095 --> 18:50.561
You can take us both
there together.

18:50.563 --> 18:52.163
Becca, Becca.

18:52.165 --> 18:53.431
Give us a minute.

18:53.433 --> 18:54.499
Come on, come with me.

18:54.501 --> 18:55.666
What's happening?

18:55.668 --> 18:57.168
I don't know.

18:57.170 --> 18:59.504
(exhales)
Did Theo do this?

18:59.506 --> 19:02.473
We don't know that anyone
did anything.

19:04.844 --> 19:07.245
We just figured everything out.

19:07.247 --> 19:09.347
And none of that changes.

19:09.349 --> 19:12.150
I don't want to go alone.

19:12.152 --> 19:16.354
I can't be alone... again.

19:16.356 --> 19:18.356
When you go to sleep,

19:18.358 --> 19:21.459
I promise you,
I will be there.

19:21.461 --> 19:25.997
And when you wake up,
I will be there, too.

19:25.999 --> 19:28.866
Wherever I am...

19:28.868 --> 19:32.436
and wherever you are.

19:32.438 --> 19:33.738
Both of you.

19:44.951 --> 19:47.518
(sniffling)

19:57.463 --> 19:59.764
(engine starting)
(quietly): Come on.

20:08.741 --> 20:11.409
(Rebecca sighs)

20:30.330 --> 20:32.997
The last group is moving
towards the pods.

20:32.999 --> 20:35.900
Which we hope will work.

20:43.876 --> 20:45.876
There are no guarantees
in this life.

20:45.878 --> 20:49.380
You're a surgeon;
you know this.

20:49.382 --> 20:52.250
I've had lives in my hands.

20:52.252 --> 20:54.185
Held a human heart, beating.

20:54.187 --> 20:57.255
Did one earlier today,
as a matter of fact.

20:57.257 --> 20:59.557
But we're not saving
just one life.

20:59.559 --> 21:02.893
We're saving the human race.

21:02.895 --> 21:04.762
It isn't any different.

21:04.764 --> 21:06.063
No, it's completely different.

21:06.065 --> 21:07.732
Whoever destroys a soul,

21:07.734 --> 21:10.801
it is considered as if it
destroyed an entire world.

21:10.803 --> 21:12.403
And whoever saves a life,

21:12.405 --> 21:15.373
it is considered as if
it saved an entire world.

21:15.375 --> 21:18.943
You've been saving the world
all along, Doctor.

21:18.945 --> 21:21.212
You just didn't know it.
Hmm.

21:22.215 --> 21:24.115
I fix things.

21:24.117 --> 21:28.486
Reattach nerves,
remove cancerous tissue,

21:28.488 --> 21:30.554
but it was never spiritual,

21:30.556 --> 21:31.956
not for me.

21:31.958 --> 21:35.226
Pilcher.

21:35.228 --> 21:37.962
He was playing God
when he brought us all here.

21:37.964 --> 21:40.731
Do you think it was a mistake
for him to take the fate

21:40.733 --> 21:42.667
of mankind into his own hands?

21:44.504 --> 21:46.304
A man once asked me,
would you save

21:46.306 --> 21:48.172
a hundred people if you could?

21:48.174 --> 21:49.607
A thousand people?

21:49.609 --> 21:53.277
Of course the answer is "yes."

21:53.279 --> 21:54.645
And then some crazy nurse
drugged me,

21:54.647 --> 21:56.914
kidnapped me
and brought me here.

21:56.916 --> 21:58.649
But he was talking about
if the alternative

21:58.651 --> 22:00.084
was they were all going to die,

22:00.086 --> 22:02.653
so, yes, of course,
but that's not the case.

22:02.655 --> 22:04.188
That's not what this was.

22:04.190 --> 22:08.292
Everyone here was
gonna live their lives.

22:08.294 --> 22:11.529
Die horribly or peacefully,
but naturally.

22:11.531 --> 22:14.999
And now, tonight,
choices...

22:15.001 --> 22:16.967
we're doing the same thing.

22:16.969 --> 22:19.870
You said you fixed people.

22:19.872 --> 22:21.472
Past tense.

22:21.474 --> 22:24.308
Is this something you're not
planning to do anymore?

22:24.310 --> 22:26.577
In this next life?

22:32.819 --> 22:34.552
(Abbies snarling)

22:34.554 --> 22:37.355

24:09.649 --> 24:13.984
This is Dr. Theodore Yedlin,
and, uh...

24:15.922 --> 24:17.254
...I hope whoever hears this

24:17.256 --> 24:19.990
understands all this
more than I do,

24:19.992 --> 24:22.560
but you need to know

24:22.562 --> 24:26.230
that David Pilcher was wrong
about everything.

24:26.232 --> 24:29.667
In an effort to save humanity,

24:29.669 --> 24:32.503
he created a town that is...

24:32.505 --> 24:34.972
ruled by inhumanity.

24:34.974 --> 24:37.942
An effort he had no right
to undertake,

24:37.944 --> 24:41.445
but we are now, nevertheless,
in a place where we've run out

24:41.447 --> 24:47.017
of food and there's
an enemy soon...

24:47.019 --> 24:48.786
to overtake the town

24:48.788 --> 24:50.855
and kill everyone here.

24:50.857 --> 24:53.991
David Pilcher collected
several viruses

24:53.993 --> 24:55.526
and they were kept here,

24:55.528 --> 24:58.529
I assume, for some
form of future germ warfare.

24:58.531 --> 25:03.801
I intend to inject myself with
the three most virulent strains:

25:03.803 --> 25:05.870
bubonic plague,

25:05.872 --> 25:09.573
typhoid, and Marburg.

25:11.310 --> 25:15.713
After the incubation period,
roughly 13 hours,

25:15.715 --> 25:20.718
I will walk outside
of the fence and...

25:20.720 --> 25:22.686
be consumed.

25:26.192 --> 25:29.960
By my estimations, just...

25:29.962 --> 25:32.229
medical school memory,

25:32.231 --> 25:35.232
roughly a third to the half
should be wiped out

25:35.234 --> 25:37.334
by the bubonic plague alone.

25:37.336 --> 25:41.572
The typhoid is water bearing,
as is Marburg,

25:41.574 --> 25:43.274
so the rest should follow suit.

25:44.911 --> 25:49.647
It's only a guess...
but it's the best I have.

25:49.649 --> 25:53.717
So, the existing members,
when they do wake,

25:53.719 --> 25:56.954
possibly could have a new life.

25:59.058 --> 26:01.392
So...

26:01.394 --> 26:03.694
that's all.

26:03.696 --> 26:06.063
Except...

26:06.065 --> 26:10.167
this idea of the greater good...

26:10.169 --> 26:13.370
There is no greater good.

26:13.372 --> 26:15.773
There's only good,

26:15.775 --> 26:18.275
no matter how small the act.

26:18.277 --> 26:20.344
(clicks)

26:23.516 --> 26:26.350

26:26.352 --> 26:28.419
MARIO:
Dr. Yedlin.

26:28.421 --> 26:31.755
Your wife is arriving...
your... former wife.

26:31.757 --> 26:32.957
Thanks.

26:32.959 --> 26:34.024
But there's trouble

26:34.026 --> 26:35.292
at the checkpoint.

26:35.294 --> 26:37.294
(siren wails) MAN (over
P.A.): Return to your homes.

26:37.296 --> 26:38.929
You are in group two.

26:38.931 --> 26:41.098
If you are not in your homes,
Hurry! Quick!

26:41.100 --> 26:43.300
the vans will not be able
to pick you up

26:43.302 --> 26:45.135
and process you properly.
Everyone, back up! Back up!

26:45.137 --> 26:46.937
Return to your homes now.
Clear the area!

26:46.939 --> 26:50.074
Open the gate!
Open the gate, now!

26:50.076 --> 26:52.643
Back up! Move!
Go, go, go!

26:52.645 --> 26:55.446
(angry shouting)

26:55.448 --> 26:57.514
MAN: You're not going
instead of me!

26:58.818 --> 27:00.818
(Ramsey grunting)

27:00.820 --> 27:02.252
(angry shouting continues)

27:02.254 --> 27:03.721
Let me in here!

27:04.824 --> 27:07.891
(angry shouting continues)

27:07.893 --> 27:09.059
What's going on here?

27:09.061 --> 27:10.060
Theo!

27:10.062 --> 27:11.629
They left Xander.

27:11.631 --> 27:13.230
Get back!

27:13.232 --> 27:14.665
Go home!

27:14.667 --> 27:15.733
(people screaming)

27:15.735 --> 27:16.934
Go home!

27:16.936 --> 27:18.969
(people screaming)

27:20.473 --> 27:23.807
WOMAN (over P.A.): Please stay in
line while awaiting processing.

27:28.781 --> 27:31.015
Rebecca!

27:35.621 --> 27:37.421
Where's Frank?

27:38.424 --> 27:40.991
Where's Xander?

27:44.196 --> 27:46.263
(distant shouting)

27:56.842 --> 27:58.742
Give me some of that.

28:00.146 --> 28:03.047
You're too young.

28:05.284 --> 28:07.351
(distant shouting continues)

28:12.992 --> 28:15.759
I wish I was born
somewhere else.

28:16.896 --> 28:19.029
Yeah, unfortunately,

28:19.031 --> 28:21.131
there is no
"somewhere else."

28:27.139 --> 28:29.039
What was it
like out there?

28:33.713 --> 28:36.647
Scary.

28:36.649 --> 28:39.049
So, like how
it is in here.

28:55.334 --> 28:59.837
You know, um,
she's like a mom to her.

29:02.675 --> 29:05.576
Good.

29:14.220 --> 29:15.586
(tires screech)

29:15.588 --> 29:16.687
THEO:
Get in.

29:16.689 --> 29:17.688
Both of you.

29:17.690 --> 29:18.822
Come on, get in.

29:33.139 --> 29:34.772
Let's not make
a moment of this.

29:34.774 --> 29:36.140
We got to...

29:41.247 --> 29:42.312
MAN:
Get out of the car.

29:42.314 --> 29:43.380
Who's that?

29:44.383 --> 29:46.717
I got this.

29:46.719 --> 29:49.987
We're gonna need that Jeep,
Xander.

29:49.989 --> 29:51.955
Don't do
anything stupid.

30:00.666 --> 30:04.868
(man screaming)

30:09.008 --> 30:10.574
(tires screeching)

30:30.462 --> 30:33.096
ARLENE:
Dr. Yedlin.

30:35.134 --> 30:37.935
You could have just told us.

30:38.871 --> 30:41.371
I know.

30:41.373 --> 30:44.641
Well, I thought I did
a pretty good job for you,

30:44.643 --> 30:48.345
but I guess I was wrong.

30:48.347 --> 30:51.582
So, you say hello to the future
for me, okay?

30:56.555 --> 30:57.855
Arlene.

31:00.559 --> 31:02.159
You're taking his pod.

31:02.161 --> 31:04.094
Come on.

31:08.968 --> 31:10.534
Thank you, Dr. Yedlin.

31:10.536 --> 31:12.069
Thank you.

31:29.855 --> 31:32.389
I still don't know
why you did that.

31:32.391 --> 31:34.992
And I don't, either.

31:36.762 --> 31:38.428
Things are gonna
be different?

31:39.865 --> 31:42.833
CJ:
They have to be different.

31:50.376 --> 31:51.675
(elevator bell chimes)

31:52.678 --> 31:53.944
I'll get to the pod room.

31:53.946 --> 31:54.945
It's time.

31:54.947 --> 31:56.880
Get them processed.

31:56.882 --> 31:58.582
How's your head?

31:58.584 --> 32:00.517
I'm fine.

32:00.519 --> 32:02.219
Becca?

32:02.221 --> 32:04.922
WOMAN (over P.A.): Please stay in
line while waiting to be processed.

32:09.628 --> 32:12.095
Becca!

32:14.433 --> 32:17.034
Frank!

32:17.036 --> 32:18.568
Whoa, whoa, easy.

32:18.570 --> 32:19.703
I was so scared.

32:19.705 --> 32:22.306
I'll protect you.

32:35.788 --> 32:38.088
WOMAN (over P.A.): Please
proceed in an orderly fashion.

32:38.090 --> 32:40.390
All families
will be processed together.

32:40.392 --> 32:43.493
MAN:
One at a time, please.

32:43.495 --> 32:45.829
WOMAN (over P.A.): You will all
go through physical examination,

32:45.831 --> 32:49.166
then be fitted for your suit
and led into the pod room.

32:49.168 --> 32:50.434
(gasps)

32:50.436 --> 32:52.502
CJ:
Hey.

32:52.504 --> 32:54.471
It's not your fault.

32:54.473 --> 32:56.707
We've all believed in things
here that weren't real.

32:58.777 --> 33:00.811
You don't even know.

33:00.813 --> 33:02.746
I know.

33:02.748 --> 33:05.115
Pilcher isn't here.

33:05.117 --> 33:07.451
Neither is Jason...

33:07.453 --> 33:09.019
but you are.

33:09.021 --> 33:11.288
You survived everything...

33:11.290 --> 33:15.425
with your intelligence,
your instinct.

33:15.427 --> 33:19.429
What if for once, it was put in
the service of something good?

33:19.431 --> 33:22.299
We need all of that.

33:22.301 --> 33:25.202
I need it,

33:25.204 --> 33:28.071
and you certainly deserve
a fresh start.

33:29.041 --> 33:31.108
MAN:
Move in an orderly fashion.

33:31.110 --> 33:32.642
One at a time, please.

33:32.644 --> 33:34.444
One was enough.

34:09.982 --> 34:12.516
Thank you.

34:12.518 --> 34:16.219
I guess the future
needs ice cream.

34:16.221 --> 34:18.288
I guess.

34:19.691 --> 34:22.125
We couldn't
save our marriage...

34:25.731 --> 34:27.330
...but you can save the town.

34:27.332 --> 34:29.399
(scoffs)

34:30.502 --> 34:33.370
Only you can.

34:33.372 --> 34:36.606
(shrieking)

34:39.044 --> 34:42.112
(clamoring, shrieking)

34:42.114 --> 34:44.181
(beeping quietly)

35:06.238 --> 35:07.938
(button clicks)

35:07.940 --> 35:09.706
THEO (on tape recorder):
I intend to inject myself

35:09.708 --> 35:12.242
with the three
most virulent strains:

35:12.244 --> 35:15.045
bubonic plague, typhoid,
and Marburg.

35:15.047 --> 35:17.714
The incubation period
roughly 13 hours.

35:17.716 --> 35:20.150
I will walk outside
of the fence,

35:20.152 --> 35:22.285
and be consumed.

35:22.287 --> 35:24.354
(clicks)

35:25.591 --> 35:27.824
There is no greater good.

35:27.826 --> 35:30.660
Only good,

35:30.662 --> 35:32.229
however small the act.

35:34.933 --> 35:36.800
I make this sacrifice
with the knowledge

35:36.802 --> 35:40.670
that with everything that
has been taken from me here,

35:40.672 --> 35:43.673
there is still a way
I can serve my purpose

35:43.675 --> 35:45.075
and makes things right.

35:45.077 --> 35:46.476
Don't do this.

35:47.579 --> 35:48.979
It's done.

35:50.983 --> 35:53.783
You're needed here,
Dr. Yedlin.

35:53.785 --> 35:55.619
Humanity needs you,

35:55.621 --> 35:58.355
and more people like you
in the future.

36:00.292 --> 36:02.425
And less people...

36:04.429 --> 36:07.297
...like my son.

36:07.299 --> 36:09.166
(beeps)

36:14.973 --> 36:16.740
It's morphine.

36:18.110 --> 36:21.178
Inject the entire vial
into a vein

36:21.180 --> 36:23.346
two minutes before
you go outside the fence.

36:25.117 --> 36:26.716
You'll still feel them.

36:26.718 --> 36:29.219
It's the right choice.

36:29.221 --> 36:30.787
For us both.

36:30.789 --> 36:32.956
(elevator bell chimes,
doors opening)

36:35.827 --> 36:37.427
Don't worry.

36:38.564 --> 36:40.897
The future's not
going to miss me.

36:40.899 --> 36:42.766
I'm just a girl
from Idaho, Doctor.

36:44.303 --> 36:46.770
Good-bye, Theo.

37:01.553 --> 37:05.422
Nonessential systems
have begun shutting down.

37:05.424 --> 37:08.158
Only power to the pod room
and the fence will remain.

37:08.160 --> 37:10.060
That's that.

37:17.169 --> 37:20.770
Look, I'm not much
for making speeches,

37:20.772 --> 37:23.006
and I already gave one today.

37:26.111 --> 37:29.246

we're going to wake up to...

37:46.798 --> 37:49.699

37:50.636 --> 37:53.069
...so let's carry that.

37:53.071 --> 37:56.106
Let's carry that.

37:58.810 --> 38:00.877
Good luck to us all.

38:03.115 --> 38:05.115
And hopefully,
I'll see you all very soon.
