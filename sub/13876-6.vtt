Touch it.

00:56.197 --> 00:57.457
What you making?

00:57.537 --> 00:59.728
lt's a pod that
transfers streaming matter

00:59.798 --> 01:01.799
across a temporal plane.

01:01.869 --> 01:04.930
So...

01:05.010 --> 01:06.100
What do it do?

01:06.180 --> 01:08.441
lt diffuses infusion of matter
into a liquid

01:08.511 --> 01:11.142
that can be interplaced within
the same space,

01:11.222 --> 01:13.382

01:13.452 --> 01:15.983
Alright that makes sense.
Yeah, sure.

01:29.277 --> 01:30.208
l'm a little tired.

01:30.278 --> 01:32.538
l know what
a time machine is okay,

01:32.608 --> 01:34.609
it's just like
a cotton candy machine.

01:35.679 --> 01:37.210
Or instead of cotton candy,

01:37.290 --> 01:40.981
it plays karaoke
like a karaoke machine,

01:41.061 --> 01:42.752
which is my favorite machine.

02:07.430 --> 02:08.360
Thank you very much.

02:08.430 --> 02:11.161
Hey, what's this knob do
on this thing that l,

02:11.231 --> 02:12.631
ah, don't know what it does.

02:12.701 --> 02:13.632
No no no Shake!

02:13.702 --> 02:15.062
Yes yes yes, Frylock.

02:16.903 --> 02:18.433
Damn it, that's three years of
my life

02:18.503 --> 02:19.834
right there
down the drain.

02:19.904 --> 02:20.934
Where did Shake go?

02:21.014 --> 02:22.845
The year 8008.

02:22.915 --> 02:25.816
The planet is a shriveled
raisin where no life exists,

02:25.886 --> 02:28.316
save a race of giant,
irradiated cockroaches who roam

02:28.386 --> 02:30.757
the cracked Earth in total
darkness,

02:30.827 --> 02:35.059
searching for a past
they could never understand.

02:35.129 --> 02:37.429
Damn, that sucks.

02:38.930 --> 02:41.901
Wow! Hey, Carl,
come here and read this.

02:41.971 --> 02:44.231
l think you're gonna like
what you see.

02:44.311 --> 02:45.242
Boob.

02:45.312 --> 02:47.603
Ha ha that's funny.

02:47.683 --> 02:50.203
Go ahead and hand me the phone
so l can call the police.

02:50.283 --> 02:51.584
Okay l'll do that right away.

02:51.654 --> 02:52.914
Psyche.

02:52.984 --> 02:55.215
Alright l will
get this back to you

02:55.285 --> 02:57.116
and l'll catch you on the flip.

02:58.196 --> 02:59.126
Shake, you're back!

02:59.196 --> 03:01.357
Yes, l am back from
the Boob dimension

03:01.427 --> 03:02.867
and there was much to see.

03:02.927 --> 03:04.898
And many chairs were made
available to me

03:04.968 --> 03:08.169
free of charge
upon my arrival.

03:08.239 --> 03:09.670
But l tire from my journey.

03:09.740 --> 03:10.670
You'll excuse me.

03:10.740 --> 03:11.670
No, no, no! Wait wait!

03:11.740 --> 03:12.941
Tell me, was it total darkness?

03:13.011 --> 03:13.941
Yeah l guess.

03:14.011 --> 03:15.952
Did you bring back a sample,
a plant, a flower, something?

03:16.012 --> 03:16.952
Ah huh sure.

03:17.022 --> 03:17.952
What sure?

03:18.022 --> 03:18.953
Whatever.

03:19.023 --> 03:20.483
What what the hell do you mean,
''sure man''?

03:21.453 --> 03:22.984
Tell me, were there
giant cockroaches?

03:23.054 --> 03:24.394
Huge, man. Big ones.

03:24.464 --> 03:25.395
Big ones?

03:25.465 --> 03:26.355
Big as your face.

03:26.425 --> 03:28.326
- What?
- Mountains.

03:28.396 --> 03:30.456
Wait, a race of large
breasted female --

03:30.536 --> 03:31.467
Female cockroaches?

03:31.537 --> 03:32.627
Yeah.
And free chairs too.

03:32.707 --> 03:33.637
So step off.

03:34.708 --> 03:37.078
We need to test you for sulfur
deposit, publish the findings.

03:37.148 --> 03:39.439
l mean this is an incredible
historic achievement.

03:39.509 --> 03:40.450
Yes for me.

03:40.520 --> 03:42.680
Look as a wise Fonzie once said
to Potsie,

03:42.750 --> 03:45.311
l'm tired
and l'm ready for TV.

03:45.391 --> 03:46.321
Hey wait a minute.

03:46.391 --> 03:48.012
This says 7734.

03:48.092 --> 03:49.022
Exactly.

03:49.092 --> 03:50.683
lt's hell upside down.

03:50.763 --> 03:53.494
The goal was to make it
say ''turd,'' but, ah,

03:53.564 --> 03:54.864
l think it still works.

03:54.934 --> 03:55.924
But then that means.

03:56.005 --> 04:00.436
That we've been living
in the year 7734.

04:01.146 --> 04:02.437
Or maybe my machine
doesn't work.

04:02.507 --> 04:03.447
Oh good.

04:04.577 --> 04:06.348
But that's impossible!
l'm a genius!

04:08.489 --> 04:10.609
l think he wants us
to leave the room!

04:10.689 --> 04:11.710
Cheese in the room?!

04:11.710 --> 04:14.350
i think hew wants...

04:14.691 --> 04:16.161
Oh okay!

04:16.711 --> 04:20.402
as u wish...

04:20.682 --> 04:23.053
of course...

04:25.604 --> 04:28.775
lf you want to spoon with me,
all you have to do is ask.

04:28.845 --> 04:30.175
And l will say no

04:30.246 --> 04:32.406
with the business end of my
expensive shotgun.

04:32.486 --> 04:34.677
l'm not finding any
carbon dated material.

04:34.757 --> 04:35.947
You want to date me now?

04:36.017 --> 04:36.958
Get off my jock!

04:37.028 --> 04:38.988
Are you sure you
traveled to the future?

04:39.058 --> 04:40.929
You saw it, l did it.

04:40.999 --> 04:43.860
l'm exhausted with your
constant questioning, okay?

04:43.930 --> 04:46.401
lf you want to see the future
just go there.

04:48.601 --> 04:49.972
l'm scared, okay.

04:50.042 --> 04:52.063
Look it's all right.

04:52.143 --> 04:53.303
You are a pussy.

04:53.373 --> 04:54.343
l am not a pussy.

04:54.413 --> 04:56.274
Yes, that's exactly
what you are.

04:56.344 --> 04:58.375
And l am an iron butted warrior.

04:58.455 --> 05:00.005
Look l don't care what
you say, alright.

05:00.085 --> 05:01.345
l'm not going to try out
a dangerous peace

05:01.426 --> 05:03.286
of scientific equipment without
at least running

05:03.356 --> 05:05.727
a set of trials
on lab mice or something.

05:05.797 --> 05:06.857
Cause you're a pussy.

05:06.927 --> 05:08.298
That tears it. Turn it on!

05:08.798 --> 05:10.028
Shall l set it to boob?

05:11.639 --> 05:15.070
Light it up to 8009.

05:19.311 --> 05:20.332
Where did he go?

05:20.412 --> 05:23.473
Uh, probably Carl's,
just like l did.

05:27.094 --> 05:30.455
Hey, l'm from the past.

05:30.625 --> 05:31.595
l brought a microphone

05:31.665 --> 05:34.596
so you can tell a little bit
about yourself,

05:34.666 --> 05:36.597
say something, or-or --

05:36.667 --> 05:37.597
Meat!

05:38.768 --> 05:39.828
Oh god no.

05:40.268 --> 05:41.208
Stay away from me!
Don't touch me!

05:41.278 --> 05:42.209
Leave me alone!

05:42.279 --> 05:44.209
You can stop crying
like a child now.

05:44.279 --> 05:45.210
You're back home.

05:45.280 --> 05:46.210
Oh god, thank you.

05:46.280 --> 05:47.210
ln your wuss cave.

05:47.280 --> 05:49.221
How were them big ass
cockroaches?

05:49.281 --> 05:50.221
Was them smart like me?

05:50.281 --> 05:52.912
Oh they-they -- yes.

05:52.992 --> 05:55.353
They were exactly
as l-l-l have said.

05:56.423 --> 05:59.484
We, uh, we exchanged much
knowledge and, uh,

05:59.564 --> 06:01.825
they-they-they made me
their leader.

06:01.905 --> 06:02.955
Really?

06:03.035 --> 06:05.766
lnteresting that l was their
leader when l was there.

06:05.836 --> 06:06.777
Yeah about that.

06:06.837 --> 06:08.207
Ah they impeached you.

06:09.607 --> 06:11.708
Did you a pick up one
of the free chairs?

06:11.778 --> 06:13.079
Well l decided not to.

06:13.149 --> 06:14.579
Hmm interesting.

06:14.649 --> 06:16.090
Sent the wrong impression
that l was lazy.

06:16.150 --> 06:18.320
Okay alright. Uh, whatever.

06:18.390 --> 06:20.821
l might take it
for another spin.

06:20.891 --> 06:21.821
Reinstate my cabinet.

06:21.891 --> 06:24.292
Maybe even pick up a matching
love seat.

06:24.362 --> 06:25.853
- Well be my guest.
- Well l am.

06:25.933 --> 06:26.763
Well go on.

06:26.833 --> 06:27.963
Well stop talking
so l can get in there.

06:28.033 --> 06:28.964
Do it then.

06:29.034 --> 06:30.234
Then l'll go.

06:31.544 --> 06:33.475
Well, cockroach men are fine.

06:33.545 --> 06:34.515
l'm the ruler again.

06:34.575 --> 06:36.276
We had a special election

06:36.346 --> 06:38.337
l didn't want to do it
but they insisted.

06:38.417 --> 06:40.977
And then on top of it
l was given this lamp,

06:41.058 --> 06:43.288
and these sweat pants.

06:43.358 --> 06:45.289
Well that looks like
that authentic G-man super bowl

06:45.359 --> 06:50.701
2008 super champion super fan
lamp that Carl owns.

06:50.771 --> 06:53.031
Well, it is not.

06:53.101 --> 06:54.592
And them look like
Carl's sweat pants.

06:54.702 --> 06:56.332
- Well they're not.
- Well yeah they is.

06:56.402 --> 06:58.303
The cockroach men
like to work out.

06:58.373 --> 06:59.403
ls that a crime?

06:59.473 --> 07:01.814
You want to go kill them now
because they like to work out?

07:01.884 --> 07:02.815
Ah l guess not.

07:02.885 --> 07:03.875
Wait a minute.

07:03.955 --> 07:05.385
Nothing happened, Shake?

07:05.455 --> 07:06.886
Not one of them
shrieked out the word ''meat''

07:06.956 --> 07:07.886
and came at you?

07:07.956 --> 07:09.587
Oh, did they do that to you?

07:09.657 --> 07:12.288
No, no, no! Hell, no!
Of course not. Not to me.

07:12.358 --> 07:14.758
l mean they revere me
with great esteem and respect.

07:14.828 --> 07:16.769
You know what,
you should drop in on them.

07:16.829 --> 07:17.769
Maybe l will.

07:17.839 --> 07:19.770
Just tell them hi
see what's going on.

07:19.840 --> 07:20.770
They miss you a lot.

07:20.840 --> 07:21.771
Yeah maybe l will.

07:21.841 --> 07:22.901
Maybe l'll bring one of them
back with me even.

07:22.971 --> 07:25.602
Yeah you do that,
cause l'd like to see that.

07:25.682 --> 07:27.142
Okay l am.

07:27.212 --> 07:28.643
- Ow my head.
- Carl?

07:29.953 --> 07:31.384
l want these books out
of here now.

07:31.454 --> 07:32.424
This is my room now.

07:32.484 --> 07:34.585
Well why don't you just
bring back some cockroach men

07:34.655 --> 07:36.715
from the future to move your
damn books for you?

07:36.795 --> 07:38.726
Are you saying
that l didn't meet them?

07:38.796 --> 07:41.557
Are are you prepared
to say that in a court of law?

07:41.637 --> 07:43.598
What l said was l ain't
moving your damn books.

07:44.568 --> 07:46.699
Well l found another
hole in your case.

07:46.769 --> 07:48.769
Cause those are Frylock's books.

07:48.839 --> 07:50.280
And they must be plowed under,

07:50.340 --> 07:55.211
because this is the future home
of my Spiderman bean bag.

07:55.281 --> 07:56.812
Frylock ain't gonna
like that, l tell you.

07:56.882 --> 07:59.153
Frylock ain't gonna be around
to bitch about it.

07:59.223 --> 08:02.784
Mmm grape soda
from the future.

08:03.094 --> 08:05.625
Damn it there's grape soda
all over the controls,

08:05.695 --> 08:06.685
we've been sabotaged!

08:06.765 --> 08:09.566
Were are my G-man
fan of the century pants?

08:09.636 --> 08:10.566
What is that?

08:10.636 --> 08:11.567
What is that sound?

08:11.637 --> 08:12.567
Ah hell.

08:12.637 --> 08:13.577
There gonna rip open this pod

08:13.637 --> 08:15.578
and eat us if we don't
do something, Carl.

08:15.648 --> 08:17.709
l'll press the freaking
button go back to Earth, dummy.

08:17.779 --> 08:18.709
lt doesn't work like that.

08:18.779 --> 08:21.580
lt diffuses the infusion of
matter into a liqui...

08:21.650 --> 08:24.121
lt releases my bowels into
my boxer shorts

08:24.191 --> 08:26.621
so please press the freaking
button and let's leave.

08:26.691 --> 08:27.782
The button's outside.

08:27.862 --> 08:28.982
Well good call.

08:29.062 --> 08:29.993
Good call.

08:30.063 --> 08:32.003
Well at least we got
an l-pod dock.

08:32.063 --> 08:34.004
See that rock over
there, Carl.

08:34.073 --> 08:35.764
Get it and bash their skulls in.

08:35.833 --> 08:38.465
Yeah and then l will
have lured them over there.

08:38.544 --> 08:39.476
Good idea, Carl.

08:39.546 --> 08:41.135
Good luck, dummy.

08:41.216 --> 08:42.977
no, carl, wait!

08:43.047 --> 08:44.307
No stay away from me.

08:44.387 --> 08:45.317
Don't touch me! Leave me alone.

08:45.387 --> 08:46.318
Stay away!

08:46.388 --> 08:47.818
Put down the rock.
Put down the rock.

08:47.888 --> 08:49.149
lt's all cool here.

08:50.729 --> 08:52.320
This rock is really light.

08:52.390 --> 08:55.291
'Cause we're in space
and, uh,

08:55.361 --> 08:56.461
it's lighter out here.

08:56.531 --> 08:58.862
Hey wait a minute,
this is a speaker.

08:58.932 --> 09:01.993
Ah the space wind
must be over, thank god.

09:02.073 --> 09:03.003
But this is Earth, man.

09:03.073 --> 09:04.594
The year 8009.

09:04.674 --> 09:08.705
Yeah, well, you know
Earth is in space...

09:10.486 --> 09:11.416
Meat! Meat!

09:12.486 --> 09:13.476
What the hell is going on here?

09:13.556 --> 09:14.577
Dude he's not buying this.

09:14.657 --> 09:17.648
Okay, um,
bear with me here.

09:17.728 --> 09:19.388
We are from the year 8009.

09:19.458 --> 09:21.729
We found your machine in a
cyber-fill

09:21.799 --> 09:23.460
at the turn
of the octo-millennium.

09:23.530 --> 09:25.530
Octo-millennium is
a good word, isn't it?

09:25.600 --> 09:28.071
But in order for us to find it,

09:28.141 --> 09:30.442
you will have
to decide not to patent it

09:30.512 --> 09:31.872
and throw it away.

09:31.942 --> 09:33.143
So we came to the present

09:33.213 --> 09:35.774
in your machine to make sure
that happens.

09:35.854 --> 09:37.784
Well l probably will
throw it away

09:37.854 --> 09:38.825
'cause the machine doesn't work.

09:38.885 --> 09:40.045
lt doesn't?

09:40.125 --> 09:42.186
lt doesn't go back
or forward in time.

09:42.256 --> 09:43.196
Ah, shoot.

09:43.256 --> 09:45.457
For whatever reason
it only goes to Carl's house.

09:45.527 --> 09:47.297
Well ah l know that.

09:47.367 --> 09:49.598
That's why we dressed
Carl's living room

09:49.668 --> 09:53.109
to look like planet Earth 8009.

09:53.169 --> 09:56.340
No but what he's saying is
how did we get here.

09:56.410 --> 09:58.471
l said that. The machine.

09:58.551 --> 10:00.982
Yeah but the machine
doesn't work.

10:01.052 --> 10:02.612
Ha ha ah impossible.

10:02.682 --> 10:03.783
lt doesn't work, man.

10:03.853 --> 10:05.513
Then were did we get these?

10:05.593 --> 10:06.524
They light up.

10:06.594 --> 10:07.524
They do.

10:07.594 --> 10:08.524
They light up look at them.

10:08.594 --> 10:09.524
See they run off a 9 volt.

10:09.594 --> 10:11.525
Hell you can get those
on the internet man.

10:11.595 --> 10:13.626
See l did, l was gonna put them
on to celebrate

10:13.696 --> 10:15.897
but you just kept yelling ''meat''
at me.

10:15.967 --> 10:18.197
l still don't understand
because if we came

10:18.277 --> 10:22.639
from planet Earth 8009
as l had heard someone said.

10:22.709 --> 10:23.649
Yeah, l had heard that too.

10:23.709 --> 10:27.280
Then it's pretty clear to me
we traveled back in time.

10:27.350 --> 10:28.551
Well here's a thought.

10:28.621 --> 10:32.392
Maybe you're not from
the year 8009.

10:32.462 --> 10:33.652
No no, no no, no.

10:33.722 --> 10:34.823
We're from there.

10:34.893 --> 10:36.553
l mean we live there.

10:36.633 --> 10:38.064
He's right man. Every day.

10:38.134 --> 10:40.194
We're totally there.

10:42.805 --> 10:44.706
Earth 8009.

10:44.776 --> 10:45.906
We've made it home!

10:45.976 --> 10:46.997
Hooray.

10:47.077 --> 10:48.667
They're how big?

10:48.747 --> 10:49.677
They huge.

10:49.747 --> 10:51.678
Yeah they're like 9-10 feet,
give or take.

10:51.748 --> 10:53.689
Just don't get trapped
into a conversation with them.

10:53.749 --> 10:54.689
Oh, they talk?

10:54.759 --> 10:55.739
Oh god.

10:55.819 --> 10:56.760
Ha, a lot.

10:56.820 --> 10:59.921
They got mouths
and make noises, like words.

10:59.991 --> 11:03.092
Can l ask how much this
little comedy act's costing?

11:03.162 --> 11:04.602
Look, hey!

11:04.672 --> 11:06.573
l found a stove!

11:06.633 --> 11:09.104
There's like,
three chairs in here.

11:09.174 --> 11:12.045
Yeah, let's go ahead
and paint the target. Over.

11:12.115 --> 11:14.205
Do you have any relatives in the
area,

11:14.285 --> 11:16.186
someone you could stay with for
a couple of months?

11:16.246 --> 11:18.377
This here's my cousin,
by marriage.
