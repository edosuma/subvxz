WEBVTT

00:01.167 --> 00:02.210
<i>I'm Harry Tasker,</i>

00:02.210 --> 00:05.088
<i>husband, dad, computer salesman,</i>

00:05.088 --> 00:08.258
<i>and for 17 years
the most important person in my life</i>

00:08.258 --> 00:10.051
<i>didn't know I was also something else.</i>

00:11.011 --> 00:12.929
<i>Omega Sector's top spy.</i>

00:13.972 --> 00:15.015
<i>I'm Helen Tasker,</i>

00:15.015 --> 00:17.100
<i>wife, mom and professor.</i>

00:17.100 --> 00:18.768
<i>After an unfortunate incident</i>

00:18.768 --> 00:21.187
<i>where I found out
our whole life was a lie,</i>

00:21.187 --> 00:23.648
<i>now I'm also a spy.</i>

00:24.816 --> 00:26.860
<i>Honey, all those things are true.</i>

00:26.860 --> 00:28.486
<i>- They're just, you know...
- What?</i>

00:28.486 --> 00:30.947
<i>True lies.</i>

01:38.431 --> 01:39.599
Gib, maybe we should call it.

01:40.391 --> 01:41.267
I don't know, Harry.

01:41.267 --> 01:42.644
Training isn't supposed to be easy.

01:42.852 --> 01:44.896
Come on, Helen, you can do it.

01:45.605 --> 01:47.524
Is she tapping out?
I think she's tapping out.

01:48.316 --> 01:50.527
You know what,
training's a journey, not a destination.

01:50.527 --> 01:51.736
Maybe we should call it.

01:51.903 --> 01:53.071
Uh, Luther, I think that's enough choking

01:53.071 --> 01:54.114
for today.

01:55.281 --> 01:57.909
Okay, just to be clear,

01:58.326 --> 01:59.285
I was just doing exactly what

01:59.285 --> 02:01.162
- it says to do in the training manual.
<i>- Yeah, I know.</i>

02:01.287 --> 02:04.541
<i>I read the training manual.
Honey, are you okay?</i>

02:04.541 --> 02:06.042
<i>I guess that's a no.</i>

02:18.638 --> 02:20.098
Why do I have to go to this meeting?

02:20.098 --> 02:23.017
Is it because of the training?
Because that was a disaster.

02:23.017 --> 02:24.435
Oh, it wasn't that bad.

02:24.811 --> 02:27.856
Come on, Harry.
I sounded like a cat with a hairball.

02:28.064 --> 02:29.357
Yeah. Just remember,

02:29.357 --> 02:31.276
in the real world, you can't tap out.

02:31.276 --> 02:33.653
You do anything you can to win a fight.

02:33.653 --> 02:34.612
Yeah.

02:34.612 --> 02:35.947
All right?
Go for their eyes if you have to.

02:35.947 --> 02:37.115
The eyes? Ugh.

02:37.282 --> 02:39.033
It's kind of how we do things
in Omega Sector.

02:43.079 --> 02:44.622
Good morning, everyone.

02:44.622 --> 02:46.875
Shall we get started?

02:46.875 --> 02:47.959
Hey, Trilby, I just want to say

02:47.959 --> 02:49.460
if this is about Helen's training,

02:49.460 --> 02:51.546
- she did...
- This isn't about Helen's training.

02:51.546 --> 02:53.214
This is about her first mission.

02:54.841 --> 02:56.759
What? My first...

02:56.759 --> 02:59.304
I'm sorry, I thought...
I thought the entire plan

02:59.429 --> 03:00.388
was that we were gonna go slowly.

03:00.388 --> 03:01.931
He almost killed me.

03:01.931 --> 03:02.932
This is slow.

03:03.641 --> 03:06.060
Fast would be we'd send you to North Korea

03:06.060 --> 03:07.645
with a pocketknife and a list of targets.

03:09.606 --> 03:11.858
Is that a joke? That's a joke, right?

03:12.275 --> 03:15.778
All eyes on screen, please.

03:17.155 --> 03:18.740
<i>Omega Sector has determined</i>

03:18.740 --> 03:20.742
<i>that the terrorist
International Liberation Front</i>

03:20.950 --> 03:23.453
<i>is planning to launch
a genetically engineered plague</i>

03:23.578 --> 03:24.913
<i>in western Europe.</i>

03:25.622 --> 03:27.749
<i>Mission was referred to Omega Sector,</i>

03:28.249 --> 03:29.876
<i>which has identified a cryptographer</i>

03:29.876 --> 03:31.794
<i>who can decode the relevant files.</i>

03:32.462 --> 03:33.922
<i>Your mission:</i>

03:33.922 --> 03:35.465
<i>find the cryptographer,</i>

03:35.465 --> 03:37.967
<i>decode the files, locate weapons,</i>

03:38.843 --> 03:40.595
<i>and stop the attack.</i>

03:42.555 --> 03:43.806
Who's the cryptographer?

03:44.057 --> 03:45.975
It's an old, uh, contact of yours, Harry.

03:45.975 --> 03:47.685
Based in Madrid.

03:48.269 --> 03:49.979
Ximena Diaz.

03:52.607 --> 03:54.484
Oh. Good.

03:54.484 --> 03:56.444
Yeah, good. She's really good.

03:56.653 --> 03:58.696
Um, huh. Okay.

03:58.696 --> 04:01.991
Are you sure she's the only one?

04:01.991 --> 04:04.035
Yes, and that's the problem.

04:05.036 --> 04:07.163
The ILF knows she's the only one

04:07.163 --> 04:09.123
who can decode it and stop the attack.

04:09.123 --> 04:11.042
They also know that the CIA's

04:11.042 --> 04:12.877
been tracking her. We have to

04:12.877 --> 04:13.962
get to her before they do.

04:13.962 --> 04:14.963
What's our cover?

04:14.963 --> 04:16.422
That's where Helen comes in.

04:16.422 --> 04:17.382
No.

04:18.758 --> 04:20.260
<i>Cover identity.</i>

04:20.260 --> 04:23.388
<i>The team will travel to Madrid undercover</i>

04:23.554 --> 04:25.139
<i>as representatives
of Telonyx Computer Systems,</i>

04:25.306 --> 04:26.432
<i>where they will be selling computers</i>

04:26.432 --> 04:28.101
<i>at an academic conference.</i>

04:29.435 --> 04:31.187
<i>Omega Sector trainee Helen Tasker</i>

04:31.187 --> 04:32.897
<i>will be attending under her cover</i>

04:32.897 --> 04:35.275
<i>as a linguistics professor
at Shoreton University.</i>

04:37.944 --> 04:41.948
<i>La Conferencia Lingüística?</i>

04:41.948 --> 04:44.117
That's like the Coachella
of linguistics conferences.

04:44.117 --> 04:45.618
Isn't that exciting.

04:45.618 --> 04:49.455
You leave in 24 hours. Good luck.

04:52.208 --> 04:54.127
Hey, guys, I know
there's been a lot of changes lately,

04:54.127 --> 04:56.004
with Mom's new job at Shoreton,

04:56.004 --> 04:57.755
but I guess this conference

04:57.755 --> 04:59.465
is kind of a big deal.

04:59.465 --> 05:01.217
Kind of? Yeah.

05:01.217 --> 05:02.760
No, it's a huge deal.

05:02.760 --> 05:04.721
Well, there you go.
It's bigger than I thought.

05:04.721 --> 05:06.264
Anyway, we're just
gonna be gone for a few days.

05:06.264 --> 05:08.141
Sounds good.

05:08.141 --> 05:10.351
If it's for Mom's job,
why are you both going?

05:11.561 --> 05:12.437
Well...

05:12.437 --> 05:15.189
uni-universities need computers.

05:15.690 --> 05:16.691
Yeah, but you've been a professor

05:16.691 --> 05:17.734
for, like, a million years.

05:19.944 --> 05:21.070
Big school, Jake.

05:21.070 --> 05:23.156
Huge opportunities for computer sales.

05:24.449 --> 05:26.117
Okay, but, like, it's just happening...

05:27.285 --> 05:29.704
I think it's great that you guys

05:29.704 --> 05:30.913
are going together.

05:31.331 --> 05:32.707
Right? It'll be so romantic.

05:32.707 --> 05:33.875
Dana.

05:33.875 --> 05:36.502
We'll be fine.

05:39.964 --> 05:42.383
I swear, when I found out you were a spy,

05:42.383 --> 05:44.052
I was like, "Oh, finally,

05:44.052 --> 05:45.511
everything makes sense," you know?

05:45.511 --> 05:47.180
17 years into marriage, we can finally

05:47.180 --> 05:48.598
be honest with each other.

05:48.598 --> 05:51.559
And we are. I mean...

05:51.559 --> 05:52.727
it's better, right?

05:52.727 --> 05:54.479
No. I mean, yes.

05:54.479 --> 05:56.647
Between us, yes.
We can be honest with each other,

05:56.647 --> 05:58.399
but now, you know,

05:58.399 --> 06:00.360
now I feel like
I'm lying to everybody else.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.987
Like this conference. It's special.

06:02.987 --> 06:04.280
I've always dreamed
of going to this thing,

06:04.280 --> 06:05.740
but not, you know,

06:05.740 --> 06:06.866
not like this.

06:06.866 --> 06:08.576
Honey, it's just how these things work.

06:08.576 --> 06:11.245
This is the perfect cover ID. And Omega's

06:11.245 --> 06:13.331
giving us excuses
to be in foreign countries.

06:13.331 --> 06:16.084
I know, but now I'm the excuse.

06:16.084 --> 06:18.169
I'm the lie. Everything's a lie.

06:18.169 --> 06:20.213
The night stand is a gun safe,

06:20.213 --> 06:21.923
there's a signal jammer in the toaster.

06:21.923 --> 06:23.549
The bathroom is some...

06:23.549 --> 06:25.593
- What is the bathroom?
- A safe room, but no one knows.

06:25.593 --> 06:27.512
The bathroom is a safe room.
Bathroom is a lie.

06:27.512 --> 06:29.555
Honey, I think it's healthier

06:29.555 --> 06:31.265
if you don't think about it as lying.

06:31.265 --> 06:33.601
It's just... leaving out details.

06:33.601 --> 06:35.520
I know, but I'm not good at it.

06:35.520 --> 06:37.355
I'm bad. I almost broke tonight.

06:37.355 --> 06:39.565
With Jake, you know,
looking at his little eyes.

06:39.565 --> 06:40.900
And that's a 14-year-old

06:40.900 --> 06:43.194
just asking me questions

06:43.194 --> 06:44.362
while I'm eating mashed potatoes.

06:44.362 --> 06:46.030
Honey. Honey, look.

06:46.030 --> 06:47.782
- We're protecting people.
- Mm-hmm.

06:47.782 --> 06:48.908
We're doing something important here.

06:48.908 --> 06:50.284
- Focus on that.
- Mm.

06:51.786 --> 06:53.121
I know.

06:56.541 --> 06:57.500
So, who's this person

06:57.500 --> 06:59.585
that you're meeting in Madrid?

06:59.585 --> 07:02.755
Oh, just, you know, some cryptographer.

07:02.755 --> 07:03.965
Mm-hmm.

07:07.885 --> 07:08.970
Hey, bud.

07:10.263 --> 07:11.806
- Ready to go?
- Almost.

07:11.806 --> 07:13.474
You know, Helen's got an entire bag

07:13.474 --> 07:14.642
and half my bag.

07:14.642 --> 07:17.019
Speaking of Helen,

07:17.019 --> 07:18.521
you, uh, get a chance to talk to her

07:18.521 --> 07:19.981
about the whole Ximena situation?

07:19.981 --> 07:21.774
- Shut up!
- Whoa.

07:21.774 --> 07:24.527
- She's downstairs.
- Okay, guess that's a no.

07:24.527 --> 07:27.738
Come on, Harry, you can't
be keeping secrets at this point.

07:27.738 --> 07:29.198
Hey, man.

07:43.129 --> 07:45.381
There is no secret about Ximena.

07:45.381 --> 07:47.717
Then why are we whispering?

07:48.801 --> 07:52.263
Okay, look,
I didn't tell Helen about Ximena

07:52.263 --> 07:53.764
because Ximena is need-to-know,

07:53.764 --> 07:55.766
and Helen doesn't need to know.

07:55.766 --> 07:57.894
You see, the thing about that is, Harry,

07:57.894 --> 08:01.147
I happened to pull Ximena's dossier
to prep for the meeting.

08:01.147 --> 08:03.191
Ran across a recent pic.

08:05.776 --> 08:06.861
You really gonna try to tell me

08:06.861 --> 08:08.321
that Helen doesn't need to know

08:08.321 --> 08:09.947
that this is the asset
that you've been working with?

08:09.947 --> 08:11.824
"Worked with," past tense. It's nothing.

08:12.825 --> 08:14.952
I know your history, man.

08:14.952 --> 08:17.955
It's may not be everything,
but it's not nothing.

08:17.955 --> 08:20.374
That "almost nothing"
was before we were even together.

08:21.626 --> 08:24.086
I can't tell her about Ximena. I can't.

08:24.086 --> 08:26.464
Gib. Gib, I just got out of the doghouse

08:26.464 --> 08:29.383
for not telling her that I was a spy
for our entire marriage.

08:29.383 --> 08:31.219
Helen's not even gonna meet Ximena.

08:31.219 --> 08:32.512
It's not that big a deal.

08:32.512 --> 08:33.763
Oh, it's not that big of a deal?

08:33.763 --> 08:35.681
Look at that,
here comes Helen up the stairs,

08:35.681 --> 08:37.850
so why don't I just open the door and...

08:42.730 --> 08:44.607
Hey. What is this?

08:44.607 --> 08:46.108
Big spy meeting? Oh.

08:46.108 --> 08:48.319
Big spy meeting. In the safe room.

08:48.319 --> 08:50.154
No, no. Well, yeah, kind of.

08:50.154 --> 08:51.864
We're just
going over the details of the trip.

08:51.864 --> 08:53.616
- We should go.
- Yeah, yeah.

08:55.660 --> 08:57.453
But this is the safe room?

08:57.453 --> 08:58.829
Is it?

09:09.632 --> 09:11.425
<i>All right, mission review.</i>

09:11.425 --> 09:14.136
<i>Team touches down in Madrid at 0800 hours.</i>

09:14.136 --> 09:16.138
<i>Harry will reach out to our contact,</i>

09:16.138 --> 09:18.266
<i>Ximena Diaz, via the dark web.</i>

09:18.266 --> 09:21.394
<i>She will send an address
using a one-time code key</i>

09:21.394 --> 09:22.603
<i>an hour before the meeting.</i>

09:24.272 --> 09:26.065
<i>Until then, we establish our cover</i>

09:26.065 --> 09:27.858
<i>selling computers
at the academic conference.</i>

09:30.736 --> 09:33.656
<i>While Helen does...</i>

09:33.656 --> 09:37.285
<i>whatever linguistic professors
do at a conference.</i>

09:37.994 --> 09:39.704
<i>Mom, there's no "update".</i>

09:39.704 --> 09:41.581
<i>Jake's playing video games, and I'm, uh,</i>

09:41.581 --> 09:43.666
<i>I'm making popcorn. Okay? That's all.</i>

09:43.666 --> 09:45.835
Okay. Well, you're obviously
doing something,

09:45.835 --> 09:48.004
so I want to know
what you guys are getting into tonight.

09:48.129 --> 09:49.755
Look, go nerd out
with your professor friends.

09:49.755 --> 09:52.133
I have to go, okay?
My, uh, my popcorn is burning.

09:52.133 --> 09:53.926
Okay, bye.

09:55.219 --> 09:57.388
Well, something's up.

09:57.388 --> 10:00.558
She's using her sneaky voice.

10:00.558 --> 10:02.977
What? She sounds fine.

10:02.977 --> 10:04.770
No, she sounds like
she's hiding something.

10:06.856 --> 10:09.317
Why, because she's
not telling us everything?

10:09.317 --> 10:10.484
Helen, when you were a kid,

10:10.484 --> 10:12.111
did you tell your parents everything?

10:12.111 --> 10:14.530
Uh, no. That's why I'm worried.

10:14.530 --> 10:16.866
When we were in Paris,

10:16.866 --> 10:19.619
you had Omega Sector monitor the house.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.370
Can they tell us what she's doing?

10:21.370 --> 10:22.830
Well, technically.

10:22.830 --> 10:25.166
I did ask Mrs. Myers to spy on Dana once,

10:25.166 --> 10:27.543
and... it's a bad idea.

10:27.543 --> 10:29.211
What do you mean, bad idea?

10:29.211 --> 10:31.672
She's burning popcorn right now.
It could be dangerous.

10:31.672 --> 10:34.634
Helen, what's dangerous
is where we are, in Madrid.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.302
We're here to stop a terrorist attack.

10:36.302 --> 10:38.012
Okay, listen.

10:38.137 --> 10:39.263
- I was in Lebanon once,
- Uh-huh.

10:39.388 --> 10:40.431
and I was worried Dana was vaping...

10:40.431 --> 10:41.682
- She's vaping?
- No, no.

10:41.682 --> 10:43.726
She just tried it once. But I was a mess

10:43.726 --> 10:45.686
the whole time. I was always wondering

10:45.686 --> 10:46.854
if I should do something,

10:46.854 --> 10:48.272
and in the end, she stopped anyway.

10:48.272 --> 10:50.274
Okay, well, what if she hadn't, Harry?

10:50.274 --> 10:52.860
You know? It goes vapes...

10:52.860 --> 10:54.236
crack cocaine, meth.

10:55.488 --> 10:58.324
I-I'm just trying to make sure
that our kids are safe, okay?

10:58.324 --> 10:59.408
Is that too much to ask?

11:09.335 --> 11:10.795
Identify.

11:10.795 --> 11:14.090
Harry Tasker
requesting security protocol Orange.

11:14.090 --> 11:17.176
Orange? You sure?

11:17.176 --> 11:19.762
Well, Helen is, so...

11:20.680 --> 11:21.889
Copy that.

11:21.889 --> 11:23.099
Initiating protocol.

11:23.099 --> 11:25.017
<i>Thanks, Mrs. Myers.</i>

11:32.441 --> 11:34.735
Not every day
someone gets an endowed professorship

11:34.735 --> 11:37.697
at Shoreton University
from a graduate thesis.

11:37.697 --> 11:40.074
You are the talk of the conference.

11:40.074 --> 11:42.827
Thank you. It's a great opportunity.

11:42.827 --> 11:46.163
Speaking of great opportunities,
Telonyx Solutions

11:46.163 --> 11:48.249
is offering ten percent off
Internet routers.

11:48.249 --> 11:49.625
And if you'd like a demo,

11:49.625 --> 11:51.252
we can stop by your hotel room later.

11:53.087 --> 11:53.963
Uh... thanks.

11:53.963 --> 11:56.048
Uh, I'll keep it in mind.

11:57.258 --> 11:58.968
That is one of the most

11:58.968 --> 12:00.386
important linguists in the world.

12:00.386 --> 12:01.929
Do you really need to sell him routers?

12:01.929 --> 12:04.098
- We are trying to maintain our cover ID.
- Yeah?

12:04.098 --> 12:05.725
Did Ximena make contact yet?

12:05.725 --> 12:08.436
No, nothing yet.
But, speaking of Ximena...

12:10.020 --> 12:11.147
Helen?

12:12.189 --> 12:13.607
Is that you?

12:13.774 --> 12:16.193
Harold? Harold, oh, my gosh!

12:16.318 --> 12:18.654
- It's so good to see you.
- Wow.

12:19.697 --> 12:21.031
- Harold, this is my husband, Harry.
- Oh.

12:21.157 --> 12:23.743
And this is his work colleague Gib.

12:24.034 --> 12:26.537
Hey, what's up, man?
Yeah, so, I got to take this.

12:27.371 --> 12:28.372
Harold and I

12:28.372 --> 12:30.416
went to Columbia together,

12:30.416 --> 12:34.211
- where he was the superstar of all...
- Oh, hardly.

12:34.211 --> 12:35.546
You were the superstar.

12:35.546 --> 12:37.631
The only reason I passed syntactic theory

12:37.631 --> 12:38.883
is because I was living with you.

12:40.134 --> 12:41.802
Oh, you lived together?

12:42.011 --> 12:43.220
Yeah, you remember I told you

12:43.345 --> 12:44.555
about my boyfriend
from grad school, Harry.

12:45.306 --> 12:48.225
So, I hear you're still at Harvard?

12:48.350 --> 12:49.143
- Mm-hmm.
- And did I hear

12:49.143 --> 12:50.603
that you also got a genius grant?

12:50.728 --> 12:52.229
Well, as they say,

12:52.229 --> 12:53.522
<i>"Pole pole..."</i>

12:53.522 --> 12:55.357
Yeah.

12:55.357 --> 12:56.358
<i>"Ndio mwendo."</i>

12:56.358 --> 12:58.068
Aw, yes!

12:59.987 --> 13:02.448
- So great. Amazing.
<i>- Pole pole</i>

13:02.448 --> 13:04.283
<i>- ndio mwendo.</i>
- Oh.

13:04.992 --> 13:07.411
Harry, um, so you in academia too?

13:07.411 --> 13:08.871
Oh, no, no. I'm in computer sales.

13:12.792 --> 13:13.751
Amazing.

13:13.751 --> 13:15.252
Uh...

13:15.628 --> 13:18.756
Uh, it's so great to meet you. Really.

13:18.964 --> 13:20.716
And, uh, I have a talk to get to.

13:20.716 --> 13:21.759
- Oh, yeah.
- But

13:21.759 --> 13:23.093
- I'll see you around?
- Yes, for sure.

13:23.093 --> 13:24.678
- Okay, great.
- So good to see you.

13:29.934 --> 13:32.102
Oh, he's wonderful.

13:32.102 --> 13:33.562
So that's your ex-boyfriend?

13:33.562 --> 13:35.397
Yes, Harold. He's great.

13:35.397 --> 13:38.108
I haven't seen him in... forever.

13:38.108 --> 13:39.860
Oh, funny, 'cause you
knew he went to Harvard,

13:39.860 --> 13:41.654
you knew that he won the genius grant.

13:41.654 --> 13:42.863
And it's so adorable you two have

13:42.863 --> 13:43.989
your own little secret language.

13:43.989 --> 13:46.700
Yeah. It's Swahili, Harry.

13:46.700 --> 13:49.119
Literally millions of people speak it.

13:49.119 --> 13:50.746
I don't know,
just think it's kind of weird

13:50.746 --> 13:52.540
that you never mentioned
that we have the same name.

13:52.540 --> 13:54.792
I don't tell you everything
about all of my exes.

13:54.792 --> 13:56.752
Well, I know that
your junior year boyfriend

13:56.752 --> 13:58.337
was named Curtis
and that he was allergic to Sharpies.

13:58.337 --> 13:59.588
Then you dated Rick

13:59.588 --> 14:01.924
and he had a mole
that looked like a VW Bug.

14:01.924 --> 14:04.009
Uh-huh. I dated Harold
a very long time ago.

14:04.009 --> 14:05.052
You don't have to be threatened.

14:05.052 --> 14:06.762
- Threatened?
- Yeah.

14:06.762 --> 14:08.889
Helen, I am so not threatened.

14:08.889 --> 14:11.267
I just don't understand why
you never mentioned him before.

14:11.267 --> 14:13.561
I don't know, Harry. You know?

14:13.561 --> 14:16.272
You kind of get a little... weird

14:16.272 --> 14:18.482
when you think
someone is smarter than you,

14:18.482 --> 14:20.025
so I just usually just leave it alone.

14:20.025 --> 14:23.237
Oh! You think he's smarter than I am?

14:23.237 --> 14:25.197
I didn't say... This is the weird...

14:25.197 --> 14:26.740
- this is the weirdness. Uh-huh.
- Hey.

14:26.740 --> 14:28.075
Sorry, am I interrupting?

14:28.826 --> 14:30.619
That was Ximena with the code.

14:30.619 --> 14:31.745
We got to go. Now.

14:41.338 --> 14:43.883
<i>All right, Harry.
Luther and Maria are in place.</i>

14:43.883 --> 14:45.426
<i>You good in there, man?</i>

14:45.426 --> 14:47.469
In position. So far, so good.

14:47.469 --> 14:50.389
Nah, I mean, what
was up with you and Helen

14:50.389 --> 14:51.599
back at the conference?

14:51.599 --> 14:53.225
well, it's fine. Helen just, uh,

14:53.225 --> 14:54.351
ran into an ex.

14:54.351 --> 14:56.562
You don't say?

14:56.562 --> 14:58.439
Kind of sounds like the perfect time

14:58.439 --> 15:00.399
<i>to bring up the whole Ximena situation.</i>

15:00.399 --> 15:02.234
There is no Ximena situation.

15:02.234 --> 15:03.485
Which one is Helen's ex?

15:03.485 --> 15:05.946
Was it the tall guy? He was hot.

15:05.946 --> 15:07.239
Who broke up with who?

15:07.239 --> 15:08.657
<i>That doesn't matter, guys.</i>

15:09.116 --> 15:10.784
Aren't you supposed
to be doing surveillance?

15:11.285 --> 15:12.494
I'm trying to focus on the mission here.

15:12.494 --> 15:13.746
- Could you just...
- Harry,

15:13.746 --> 15:15.164
spotted Ximena. Incoming

15:15.164 --> 15:16.165
to your position.

15:43.734 --> 15:44.777
Harry. <i>Querido.</i>

15:44.777 --> 15:46.153
Thank you for coming.

16:00.876 --> 16:04.588
So tell me, what is so urgent
that I get a visit?

16:04.588 --> 16:06.423
- Ximena, you're in a lot of danger.
- Ay, Harry,

16:06.423 --> 16:07.758
you worry too much.

16:08.258 --> 16:10.594
All these years,
you swore the world was about to end,

16:10.594 --> 16:12.638
and yet here we are...

16:12.638 --> 16:15.057
eating oysters.

16:22.564 --> 16:24.358
Ximena, look, this is different.

16:24.358 --> 16:26.276
- Have you heard of the ILF?
- Oh, those idiots

16:26.276 --> 16:27.569
who think that if they blow up the world

16:27.569 --> 16:29.071
anyone that's left
is gonna put them in charge?

16:29.238 --> 16:30.155
What about them?

16:30.155 --> 16:32.825
Those idiots are planning
a high-tech terror attack

16:32.825 --> 16:34.868
with bioweapons
planted in a dozen countries.

16:34.868 --> 16:37.454
The CIA got into their system,
but it's encrypted.

16:37.454 --> 16:39.915
So you just need to crack it?

16:39.915 --> 16:42.167
Of course, Harry. For you.

16:43.794 --> 16:46.880
The thing is, the ILF knows
the CIA has been following you,

16:47.464 --> 16:49.216
which means they know you're the only one

16:49.216 --> 16:50.300
standing in their way.

16:50.926 --> 16:51.885
You think they'll come after me?

16:51.885 --> 16:53.804
Not if we can take 'em out first.

16:55.180 --> 16:56.432
These are all the details
of the encryption

16:56.432 --> 16:57.850
that we need you to break.

16:57.850 --> 16:58.851
Harry.

16:58.851 --> 17:00.394
We got a problem.

17:01.729 --> 17:03.439
Four guys, incoming. Looks like ILF.

17:03.439 --> 17:04.690
How did they track her?

17:04.690 --> 17:06.692
I-I don't know,
but you got to scramble now.

17:06.692 --> 17:08.318
- Move!
- It's too late. They found you.

17:08.318 --> 17:09.862
Harry, do you need us to come in there?

17:09.862 --> 17:11.905
Negative. There's too many civilians.

17:11.905 --> 17:12.990
I can't afford a firefight.

17:21.874 --> 17:22.875
No back door? What, Madrid

17:22.875 --> 17:25.252
- doesn't have fire codes?
- No.

17:27.629 --> 17:29.339
Do we have to fight our way out?

17:29.339 --> 17:31.091
No, it's too risky. I got an idea.

17:43.145 --> 17:45.272
Go, crack the encryption.
Bring me the plans tomorrow.

17:45.272 --> 17:48.067
1400 hours,
the corner of Flores and Carretas.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.068
I'll be there.

17:50.986 --> 17:52.488
Sorry about this.

18:27.397 --> 18:28.899
So, I poked around and got some info

18:28.899 --> 18:31.151
on our friend from last night.

18:31.860 --> 18:34.488
Grozdan Ivanov. Bulgarian.

18:34.488 --> 18:36.240
Convicted of war crimes.

18:37.366 --> 18:39.660
Recruited by the Liberation Front in '16.

18:40.828 --> 18:42.246
Oh, oh, and his buddies.

18:43.247 --> 18:44.331
Almost as bad.

18:45.207 --> 18:46.834
I brought Helen in

18:46.834 --> 18:48.460
just in case they show up to the hotel.

18:48.460 --> 18:50.754
- Okay.
- Do we know that Ximena made it out?

18:50.754 --> 18:51.964
Yeah, she's good.

18:51.964 --> 18:53.423
She's gonna be at the meeting.

18:54.758 --> 18:55.926
And what about this encryption

18:55.926 --> 18:57.678
expert-- shouldn't I see her, too,

18:57.678 --> 18:59.096
just in case?

18:59.471 --> 19:00.347
Well, I mean,

19:00.347 --> 19:01.807
these covert assets-- they get weird

19:01.807 --> 19:03.267
when you photograph them,
so I don't even think

19:03.267 --> 19:04.935
we have pictures of her. Isn't that right?

19:04.935 --> 19:06.145
- Harry.
- Yeah?

19:06.145 --> 19:08.230
It seems like Dana's not the only one

19:08.230 --> 19:09.314
using her sneaky voice.

19:09.314 --> 19:10.399
Maybe I should see some of

19:10.399 --> 19:11.900
the surveillance from last night.

19:14.778 --> 19:16.363
- Right?
- Harry?

19:17.489 --> 19:18.490
For recognition purposes?

19:18.490 --> 19:19.783
- Sure, fine. Show her.
- Okay.

19:19.783 --> 19:21.285
Okay.

19:21.285 --> 19:23.579
Last night's op coming up.

19:40.179 --> 19:41.471
Helen, it was nothing.

19:41.471 --> 19:43.557
It wa-it was...
it was purely professional.

19:43.557 --> 19:44.600
Ah. Yeah. So, it was just

19:44.600 --> 19:46.602
professional oysters

19:46.602 --> 19:48.812
and professional champagne.

19:48.812 --> 19:50.814
Professional hip dip. I saw the hip grab.

19:50.814 --> 19:52.441
Let's just look
at some of your old missions.

19:52.441 --> 19:55.235
A romantic bistro,

19:55.235 --> 19:57.529
a darkened bar. Oh, yes.

19:57.529 --> 19:59.990
Look, a nice little stroll
down the Seine in Paris.

19:59.990 --> 20:02.242
Honey, our meetings have to look personal.

20:02.242 --> 20:05.162
We can't show up
in spy trench coats and sunglasses.

20:05.162 --> 20:06.330
Okay, well, there's a middle ground

20:06.330 --> 20:07.623
between trench coats

20:07.623 --> 20:09.917
and spaghetti strap evening gowns.

20:09.917 --> 20:11.919
I wanted to tell you so bad
over the years,

20:11.919 --> 20:13.754
but it was literally illegal for me

20:13.754 --> 20:15.255
- to say anything.
- Mm.

20:15.255 --> 20:18.300
Well, it's not like
you told me everything, either.

20:18.300 --> 20:20.219
I...

20:21.011 --> 20:22.179
The security line.

20:23.138 --> 20:24.473
It could be an emergency with the kids.

20:24.473 --> 20:25.641
Harry Tasker.

20:25.641 --> 20:26.725
<i>Surveillance update.</i>

20:26.725 --> 20:29.269
Fox Cub One observed purchasing

20:29.269 --> 20:31.480
a pink tube top.
Communications intercepted

20:31.480 --> 20:34.399
<i>about a gathering at the home</i>

20:34.399 --> 20:37.402
<i>of a Barry Weems, alias Zoner.</i>

20:38.987 --> 20:41.406
Age 18, arrested

20:41.406 --> 20:44.368
<i>for possession of a water pipe,
commonly known as a bong,</i>

20:44.368 --> 20:46.161
<i>age 16. Charges dismissed.</i>

20:46.161 --> 20:47.871
See? This is why I wanted to know.

20:47.871 --> 20:49.790
This is why I didn't want to know.

20:49.790 --> 20:51.416
How am I supposed to run an operation

20:51.416 --> 20:52.793
when all I can think about are the words

20:52.918 --> 20:54.044
that rhyme with Zoner?

20:54.378 --> 20:55.295
Har...

20:56.380 --> 20:58.298
Are we calling her? Are we stopping this?

20:58.298 --> 20:59.841
If we call her
she'll know we're spying on her.

20:59.841 --> 21:02.386
<i>Continue surveillance or not?</i>

21:02.386 --> 21:03.512
Honey, come... Are you...

21:03.512 --> 21:05.847
Continue surveillance. Over and out.

21:05.847 --> 21:07.557
All right, we got to go to the meeting.
Let's go.

21:07.557 --> 21:10.060
Remember, you're maintaining our cover,

21:10.060 --> 21:11.144
so when you go to the conference,

21:11.144 --> 21:13.438
do what you do best. Mingle, say hi,

21:13.438 --> 21:15.232
smile with that beautiful smile of yours,

21:15.232 --> 21:16.900
mention me, mention the team,

21:16.900 --> 21:18.402
say we're selling computers.

21:18.402 --> 21:19.736
Okay, and what are you gonna be doing?

21:19.736 --> 21:21.154
We got to go see Ximena. Hopefully

21:21.154 --> 21:23.115
- she decoded the ILF's encryption by now.
- Oh.

21:23.115 --> 21:24.324
Helen!

21:24.324 --> 21:26.076
Great news. Hey, Harry.

21:26.076 --> 21:28.370
- Hey, Harold.
- I got you a guest lecture

21:28.370 --> 21:29.788
at my department at Harvard.

21:29.788 --> 21:32.958
Oh. That-that's amazing. Thank you.

21:32.958 --> 21:35.127
Really? Wow.
Yeah.

21:35.127 --> 21:37.462
My department chair's at the bar.

21:37.462 --> 21:38.964
We can discuss the details,

21:38.964 --> 21:40.424
have a glass of champagne to celebrate?

21:40.424 --> 21:42.175
Oh, yes.

21:42.175 --> 21:45.178
Who wouldn't love
a professional glass of champagne?

21:45.178 --> 21:47.389
- You know about those.
- Very funny.

21:47.389 --> 21:48.849
Enjoy your meeting, honey.

21:48.849 --> 21:50.267
Thank you, honey.

21:51.685 --> 21:53.103
Harry.

21:59.651 --> 22:01.737
I don't want to say I told you so

22:01.737 --> 22:04.656
about the whole situation with Ximena,

22:04.656 --> 22:06.825
but, wow, did I tell you so.

22:06.825 --> 22:09.536
Thanks, man. I really appreciate that.

22:09.536 --> 22:10.746
With everything going on, I just...

22:10.746 --> 22:12.039
could use some support.

22:12.039 --> 22:13.415
Harry, I am on your side, dude,

22:13.415 --> 22:15.667
'cause Harold is a smoke show,
and he's a genius,

22:15.667 --> 22:18.920
and-and they lived together,
so that is way worse

22:18.920 --> 22:20.130
than having dinner with an asset.

22:20.130 --> 22:21.506
Great. I don't know what you're trying

22:21.506 --> 22:23.383
to do to me,
but that's not helping at all.

22:23.383 --> 22:24.885
You should feel good, bro.

22:24.885 --> 22:27.971
She could have
settled for a lot of other guys.

22:27.971 --> 22:29.056
She settled for you.

22:29.056 --> 22:31.433
Yeah, good one, Luther. Thanks.

22:31.433 --> 22:34.144
Can we just focus
on the, uh, mission at hand here?

22:34.144 --> 22:36.188
Right, mission.
All right, so here's the plan.

22:37.564 --> 22:39.191
<i>I'm gonna set up on a nearby street</i>

22:39.191 --> 22:41.151
<i>out of sight. Harry, you're with me,</i>

22:41.151 --> 22:43.403
<i>while Luther and Maria position themselves</i>

22:43.403 --> 22:45.405
<i>and cover the area from a sniper position.</i>

22:45.405 --> 22:47.115
<i>I'll run surveillance with the drone</i>

22:47.115 --> 22:49.534
<i>while you go get the plans</i>

22:49.534 --> 22:51.411
and bring in Ximena for exfiltration.

22:52.454 --> 22:54.623
And there she is.

23:11.765 --> 23:13.350
Look at that.

23:13.350 --> 23:15.435
You know, it's like
she's immune to helmet hair.

23:17.396 --> 23:19.731
All right, Harry, you're up.
Get out of here.

23:21.274 --> 23:22.734
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

23:22.734 --> 23:24.152
Picking up some radio signals.

23:24.152 --> 23:25.987
Uh, I think I can hack in.

23:28.532 --> 23:30.575
Foreign chatter.

23:30.575 --> 23:32.452
What is it?

23:32.452 --> 23:34.162
Sounds like a tactical team.

23:35.247 --> 23:37.165
I think someone may be following Ximena.

23:40.419 --> 23:41.503
Scratch that.

23:41.503 --> 23:43.588
Someone is definitely following Ximena.

23:43.588 --> 23:44.589
Guys, cover her.

23:44.589 --> 23:46.675
Harry! Harry, where you going?

23:57.185 --> 23:59.271
We can't stop it. It's armored.

24:16.663 --> 24:18.039
Ximena turned down a side street.

24:18.039 --> 24:19.708
<i>Doubling back on Avenida Monterrey.</i>

24:19.708 --> 24:21.376
<i>Perfect. I can cut them off.</i>

24:21.376 --> 24:23.211
Uh, not perfect.

24:23.211 --> 24:24.504
What are you gonna do when you get there?

24:24.504 --> 24:25.797
<i>Trust me, Gib, I've got an idea.</i>

24:25.797 --> 24:28.300
<i>How do you say "chicken" in Bulgarian?</i>

24:28.300 --> 24:29.718
Well, you don't say "chicken" in...

24:29.718 --> 24:32.220
You can't play chicken
with an armored SUV, Harry.

24:33.597 --> 24:35.974
<i>Well, I'm gonna try. Wish me luck.</i>

24:35.974 --> 24:37.517
<i>I wish you would not do this.</i>

25:10.425 --> 25:11.968
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

25:11.968 --> 25:13.637
- Just a little road rash.
- Harry.

25:13.637 --> 25:15.055
You could have died.

25:17.599 --> 25:19.726
I still can't believe
that you wedged yourself

25:19.851 --> 25:22.646
under an armored SUV to save...

25:22.771 --> 25:24.064
to save Ximena.

25:24.064 --> 25:26.525
Honey, I actually did that

25:26.525 --> 25:28.068
to save the entire operation.

25:28.068 --> 25:30.946
Hopefully, Ximena will call soon.

25:32.113 --> 25:34.199
Yes, we would not
want to lose touch with Ximena.

25:34.199 --> 25:35.450
- For the mission.
- For the mission.

25:35.450 --> 25:36.868
- For the mission, honey.
- For the mission.

25:36.868 --> 25:38.245
She has information we need

25:38.245 --> 25:39.621
to stop bombs from going off

25:39.621 --> 25:41.039
in a dozen countries.

25:42.832 --> 25:44.292
Omega Security.

25:44.292 --> 25:45.502
Helen Tasker.

25:45.502 --> 25:47.379
Update on Fox Cub One.

25:47.379 --> 25:49.548
Subject about to leave for Zoner's party.

25:49.548 --> 25:51.216
Is she wearing the tube top?

25:51.216 --> 25:52.342
Can I get a read on

25:52.342 --> 25:53.510
the approximate tightness, please?

25:53.510 --> 25:54.636
Mm...

25:54.636 --> 25:56.721
Affirmative on the tube top,

25:56.721 --> 25:59.140
appears to be within
normal tightness parameters.

25:59.140 --> 26:01.393
<i>The cookies are in the jar.</i>

26:02.394 --> 26:03.436
Hang on.

26:05.063 --> 26:07.274
Fox Cub One is apparently getting a ride

26:07.274 --> 26:09.442
with the driver of a muscle car,

26:09.442 --> 26:11.236
<i>yellow, black stripe.</i>

26:11.236 --> 26:13.780
<i>Male, approximately 17 years old,</i>

26:13.780 --> 26:16.283
<i>like a Zack Morris vibe?</i>

26:16.283 --> 26:18.660
Do we have any intel

26:18.660 --> 26:20.579
on this muscle car driver?

26:20.579 --> 26:22.247
Uh, an ID? A GPA?

26:22.414 --> 26:23.748
Helen, we got a problem.

26:23.748 --> 26:24.833
Yeah, our daughter is getting into

26:24.833 --> 26:25.834
a yellow muscle car.

26:25.834 --> 26:27.586
Gib, what's going on? What's wrong?

26:27.586 --> 26:28.878
<i>Uh, you know how yesterday,</i>

26:28.878 --> 26:30.046
<i>I cracked into the ILF's comms systems</i>

26:30.046 --> 26:32.465
<i>- with an RTL-SDR?</i>
- Yeah.

26:32.465 --> 26:34.551
Well, I placed an electronic
geo tracker on them, and

26:34.551 --> 26:36.803
we found them, and they're here.

26:36.803 --> 26:38.680
Here? How?

26:38.680 --> 26:39.889
I have no idea.

26:39.889 --> 26:41.641
All I know is that there's a team of guys

26:41.641 --> 26:43.768
talking Bulgarian
about going after a Harry,

26:43.768 --> 26:45.729
<i>and they're in the hotel.</i>

26:46.605 --> 26:48.273
- What am I gonna do with this?
- Use it.

26:48.273 --> 26:49.357
Harry, I was grading papers,

26:49.357 --> 26:50.567
I didn't even finish weapons training.

26:50.567 --> 26:51.860
Well, you're about to finish
weapons training

26:51.860 --> 26:53.612
Just point it at the bad guys and shoot.

27:02.829 --> 27:05.665
Harry, you guys ready?

27:05.665 --> 27:08.043
Ready as we can be, Gib.

27:13.840 --> 27:15.300
Harry, they're coming.

27:15.300 --> 27:17.636
I can't see them, but I can hear them.

27:43.495 --> 27:44.788
H-Harry? Helen?

27:46.998 --> 27:50.377
yeah? What's going on, Gib?
They're not here.

27:50.377 --> 27:53.838
Whose hotel room
did these guys just break into, then?

27:54.506 --> 27:56.049
<i>Please, my name is Harold Winslow!</i>

27:56.049 --> 27:58.009
<i>I'm a linguist here for a conference!</i>

27:58.218 --> 27:59.511
<i>I'm a MacArthur Fellow. Uh...</i>

28:02.263 --> 28:04.933
I think the International Liberation Front

28:04.933 --> 28:06.893
just abducted Helen's ex-boyfriend.

28:06.893 --> 28:07.977
What? Why?

28:07.977 --> 28:09.771
I don't kno...

28:09.771 --> 28:11.106
Harry, meet me

28:11.106 --> 28:12.107
at the tac van. Now.

28:19.864 --> 28:21.491
Well, looks like they stopped.

28:21.491 --> 28:23.076
We have any idea where we're going?

28:23.076 --> 28:25.453
The GPS is following their radio signals.

28:25.453 --> 28:26.538
Just stay on 'em.

28:26.538 --> 28:28.415
- Gib, how did this happen?
- Uh, well,

28:28.415 --> 28:30.709
the Bulgarian translation's iffy,
but basically,

28:30.709 --> 28:32.544
the ILF was listening in

28:32.544 --> 28:34.504
on Ximena's cell phone somehow.

28:34.504 --> 28:36.631
That's how they've been finding her.

28:36.631 --> 28:39.259
Yep. And then, when she called the hotel,

28:39.259 --> 28:40.260
they were listening.

28:40.260 --> 28:41.928
So she calls, asks for Harry,

28:41.928 --> 28:44.347
they accidentally
send her to Harold's room,

28:44.347 --> 28:46.725
she leaves a message, the ILF guys come,

28:46.725 --> 28:48.351
bust in the doors looking for you.

28:48.351 --> 28:49.978
What's the message?

28:50.562 --> 28:52.272
It's a date.

28:52.272 --> 28:54.399
October 19, 2005.

28:54.816 --> 28:56.526
We met at a safe house on that date.

28:56.901 --> 28:59.070
Okay. Okay.

28:59.070 --> 29:00.989
Harry, we got to get somebody over there

29:00.989 --> 29:03.408
to get the location
of those bioweapons from Ximena.

29:03.408 --> 29:05.118
Gib, we're going up against
a terrorist team

29:05.118 --> 29:07.495
armed with machine guns.
We can't spare anyone.

29:08.037 --> 29:09.289
Wasn't thinking one of us.

29:10.665 --> 29:11.833
- No.
- Yes.

29:11.833 --> 29:13.543
- No. No.
- Yes.

29:13.543 --> 29:14.753
- No!
- Listen to me.

29:14.753 --> 29:16.379
Sending Helen is the safest option.

29:16.379 --> 29:18.047
- She can't...
- Yes.

29:18.047 --> 29:19.716
The clock's ticking
on this terrorist attack.

29:19.716 --> 29:21.634
Do you really want
thousands of people to die

29:21.634 --> 29:23.136
because you're uncomfortable
with your wife

29:23.136 --> 29:24.220
speaking to your ex?

29:28.641 --> 29:30.143
Harry? Are you okay?

29:30.143 --> 29:31.227
Yeah, I'm fine.

29:31.227 --> 29:32.312
<i>All right. Did you save Harold?</i>

29:32.812 --> 29:34.606
Uh, well, we're working on that. Listen,

29:34.606 --> 29:36.691
Helen, um, we need you to do something.

29:36.900 --> 29:39.110
Wh... I-I...
My hands are still shaking. What do...

29:39.110 --> 29:40.570
I-I know. Um,

29:40.570 --> 29:42.697
we need you to go to a safe house.

29:42.697 --> 29:44.115
<i>It's near the hotel,</i>

29:44.115 --> 29:46.993
<i>and we need you
to get the ILF's decoded plans.</i>

29:46.993 --> 29:49.913
It's a safe house where I met Ximena.

29:49.913 --> 29:51.915
- Wouldn't she be expecting you?
- Honey,

29:51.915 --> 29:53.374
there-there's really no other way.

29:53.374 --> 29:54.876
Okay. Where am I going?

29:54.876 --> 29:56.377
A romantic cafe? Lingerie...

29:56.377 --> 29:58.505
- store dressing room?
- Very funny.

29:58.505 --> 30:00.340
I'm kidding. I ju... Give me the address.

30:00.340 --> 30:02.091
<i>2626 Calle de Marta.</i>

30:02.091 --> 30:03.802
She's hiding, so she may not answer.

30:03.802 --> 30:06.638
Okay, all right. I'm gonna bring the, uh,

30:06.638 --> 30:08.807
door unlocker thingy. What is it called?

30:08.807 --> 30:10.809
"Unlocker thingy's" fine. Be safe.

30:10.809 --> 30:12.644
Okay, bringing it to the...

30:32.580 --> 30:36.584
Safe houses look
a lot like love nests, I guess.

30:56.688 --> 30:57.730
Hello?

31:01.317 --> 31:02.485
Ximena?

31:11.786 --> 31:13.496
No! I'm not...

31:24.007 --> 31:25.550
Wait, I'm a friend! I'm a friend!

31:40.815 --> 31:42.400
Wait! I'm Omega Sector!

31:42.400 --> 31:43.985
Where's Harry? What did you do with him?

31:43.985 --> 31:45.820
He sent me here. I'm his wife.

31:45.820 --> 31:47.488
I know all about you.

31:47.488 --> 31:50.283
You like oysters and champagne

31:50.283 --> 31:52.869
and you look very lovely

31:52.869 --> 31:54.078
in a thigh-slit dress.

32:06.925 --> 32:09.719
All right, any idea
what's going on in there?

32:09.719 --> 32:10.970
I'm working on it.

32:11.471 --> 32:13.431
Just got to get eyes on the situation.

32:14.265 --> 32:15.224
Watch this.

32:30.573 --> 32:32.951
Not a lot of cover for an approach.

32:32.951 --> 32:34.494
Yeah, but we got skylights right there.

32:34.494 --> 32:36.496
Yeah, but we're sitting ducks
till we hit the ground.

32:36.496 --> 32:38.414
Not if I turned out the lights.

32:50.093 --> 32:51.636
Let's be careful in there.

32:51.636 --> 32:54.138
I don't want to die
saving Helen's ex-boyfriend.

33:01.312 --> 33:04.065
You got this message
from this woman Ximena at the hotel.

33:04.065 --> 33:05.775
- Where is she?
- I-I don't...

33:05.775 --> 33:06.985
I don't know who you're talking about.

33:06.985 --> 33:08.695
Then why?

33:08.695 --> 33:10.989
Why she send you message, huh?

33:10.989 --> 33:12.365
I don't know!

33:16.411 --> 33:19.580
Liar.

33:25.628 --> 33:27.046
No games.

33:27.714 --> 33:29.257
Tell me where Ximena is.

33:29.424 --> 33:30.633
Guys, we got to move fast

33:30.633 --> 33:32.176
or this man's gonna have a serious limp.

33:32.176 --> 33:33.928
We're in position. How's our cover?

33:33.928 --> 33:36.723
Uh, I got an AI
hacking into the local power grid.

33:36.723 --> 33:38.266
I think I can buy you about 30 seconds.

33:38.266 --> 33:39.350
That enough?

33:39.350 --> 33:40.393
It'll have to be.

33:42.103 --> 33:45.023
<i>You decoded the file?
We can find those bombs?</i>

33:45.023 --> 33:47.150
I just need to take care
of something first.

33:49.986 --> 33:51.446
So, is your ear okay?

33:52.238 --> 33:54.282
Feel like I might have
poked your brain a little.

33:55.199 --> 33:56.451
It's fine. How's your throat?

33:56.951 --> 33:59.662
It's fine. Yeah. No, it, uh...

33:59.662 --> 34:00.913
happens all the time.

34:02.165 --> 34:03.207
I'm sorry I attacked you.

34:03.207 --> 34:04.625
I thought you were an ILF assassin.

34:04.876 --> 34:07.962
A... An assassin?

34:13.384 --> 34:15.386
So, um...

34:15.386 --> 34:19.390
that code that you had with Harry.

34:19.390 --> 34:20.558
The date?

34:20.558 --> 34:22.518
What was that all about?

34:23.686 --> 34:25.271
I figured the ILF was listening,

34:25.396 --> 34:26.773
so I left a message that

34:26.773 --> 34:30.234
- only he would understand.
- Mm, mm, mm.

34:30.234 --> 34:32.070
We were here
the day I fell in love with him.

34:33.362 --> 34:34.697
So, this was kind of like a...

34:34.697 --> 34:37.325
like a... your love nest?

34:37.325 --> 34:38.826
No. No, no, no. There wasn't any time.

34:38.826 --> 34:40.286
He kissed me, then he said he'd be back.

34:41.370 --> 34:42.872
Okay.

34:42.872 --> 34:44.791
So then, when he came back,
you both did...

34:44.791 --> 34:46.709
Broke my heart.

34:46.709 --> 34:48.878
He said he met someone in Puerta del Sol.

34:52.673 --> 34:54.133
Was that you?

34:54.133 --> 34:57.261
Yeah-yeah, that was me.

34:58.346 --> 35:00.598
I always thought that Harry's new love

35:00.598 --> 35:03.851
would be some American suburbs lady.

35:03.851 --> 35:05.228
You know, she just

35:05.228 --> 35:07.563
raise his kids, go to yoga class.

35:09.482 --> 35:10.900
At least he left me for a spy.

35:13.528 --> 35:14.779
Yeah, well...

35:14.779 --> 35:16.364
you know Harry.

35:18.866 --> 35:20.576
Are you sure he said Puerta del Sol?

35:20.576 --> 35:23.412
<i>Self-destruct armed.</i>

35:23.412 --> 35:25.498
There are some things you never forget.

35:26.499 --> 35:28.835
But sometimes...

35:28.835 --> 35:31.212
you have to let go of the past.

35:31.212 --> 35:32.672
Yeah.

35:45.059 --> 35:48.187
She left a message for you.

35:48.187 --> 35:51.149
Your name is in it.

35:51.149 --> 35:54.527
I d-I don't know why.
Th-There's millions of Harolds.

35:54.527 --> 35:58.948
At the hotel, there was
Harry the computer salesman.

36:02.952 --> 36:04.912
A computer salesman?

36:06.873 --> 36:09.000
Who is this computer salesman?

36:09.000 --> 36:10.668
I don't know him. I-I just met him.

36:30.688 --> 36:31.606
Guys, heads up.

36:31.606 --> 36:32.815
Lights coming up in

36:32.940 --> 36:33.900
three, two...

36:35.902 --> 36:38.529
Guns down, everyone!

36:38.529 --> 36:40.114
Everyone, or I kill him!

36:40.114 --> 36:41.324
Okay. Okay.

36:41.324 --> 36:42.283
Calm down.

36:42.283 --> 36:43.993
Gib, I need a distraction.

36:43.993 --> 36:45.036
I only need one second.

36:45.036 --> 36:46.078
Yeah, I'm on it.

36:46.078 --> 36:48.497
Uh, I'll do my best. Um...

36:48.497 --> 36:50.458
Uh...

36:50.458 --> 36:53.586
Oh, okay. Okay, okay, okay, okay.

36:53.586 --> 36:55.463
Harry, do you know who Ximena is?

36:55.463 --> 36:56.964
Harold, stop. Hey, just let him go.

36:56.964 --> 36:58.716
You don't want to hurt anybody.
You have us.

36:58.716 --> 37:02.345
This is computer salesman?

37:02.345 --> 37:04.889
Salesman who shot all of my men.

37:06.307 --> 37:08.017
I'm sorry to do this to you, baby.

37:08.017 --> 37:09.268
I love you.

37:17.193 --> 37:18.945
We got him.

37:21.656 --> 37:24.116
Guys? We all right in there?

37:24.116 --> 37:26.410
Yeah, Gib. It's over.

37:27.662 --> 37:28.788
Hey, Harry.

37:28.788 --> 37:30.164
- Hey, Harold.
- Hey.

37:30.164 --> 37:31.582
Just so you know,

37:31.582 --> 37:33.501
I'm not threatened by you.

37:41.592 --> 37:43.594
So, you're a spy?

37:43.594 --> 37:46.889
That's classified. But... yeah.

37:46.889 --> 37:48.641
It's starting to make more sense

37:48.641 --> 37:49.767
why Helen broke up with me.

37:51.769 --> 37:52.937
She broke up with you?

37:56.440 --> 37:59.110
Kind of seemed like you guys
had a lot in common.

37:59.110 --> 38:01.070
Don't you speak 30 languages?

38:01.070 --> 38:02.822
Well, she said she didn't need someone

38:02.822 --> 38:04.407
who spoke 30 languages.

38:05.783 --> 38:07.910
She needed someone who spoke her language.

38:12.456 --> 38:13.791
Think I'm gonna throw up again.

38:13.791 --> 38:15.209
Do what you got to do, man.

38:15.209 --> 38:16.210
Looks like Helen

38:16.210 --> 38:17.503
finally made it, which is nice,

38:17.503 --> 38:19.213
'cause I got to get this hard drive
back to Omega.

38:19.338 --> 38:21.299
From Ximena, the ILF plans decoded.

38:21.299 --> 38:23.634
Mission accomplished. Also, I think it was

38:23.634 --> 38:24.927
her last day on the job.

38:24.927 --> 38:26.262
She blew up her entire system.

38:26.262 --> 38:27.722
She said that if the ILF
can hack her phone,

38:27.722 --> 38:29.056
she needs to find a new line of work.

38:29.056 --> 38:30.141
It was really dramatic.

38:31.600 --> 38:33.019
Wow.

38:33.019 --> 38:34.020
Harold.

38:34.020 --> 38:35.146
Helen.

38:36.147 --> 38:37.273
You doing okay?

38:37.273 --> 38:40.234
Eh, yeah, just a little
sick to my stomach.

38:41.277 --> 38:42.862
Harry saved me.

38:46.324 --> 38:48.617
So, you're a spy, too?

38:48.617 --> 38:50.411
That's classified.

38:51.662 --> 38:54.373
But... kind of.

38:54.373 --> 38:57.335
- Huh.
- Yeah, yeah.

38:57.335 --> 38:59.337
Okay, you done? All right.

38:59.337 --> 39:02.131
You know, we should probably
get you debriefed, buddy.

39:02.131 --> 39:03.841
Come on, come with me.

39:03.841 --> 39:05.301
They're gonna ask you a lot of questions,

39:05.301 --> 39:06.594
you're gonna have to sign a bunch of stuff

39:06.594 --> 39:08.346
that says you'll never
speak about this again.

39:08.346 --> 39:09.680
But it's not all bad.

39:09.680 --> 39:10.973
You get soft serve ice cream.

39:11.849 --> 39:12.975
- Oh.
- All right?

39:12.975 --> 39:14.060
- Sounds nice.
- Yeah.

39:14.226 --> 39:15.561
I liked Harold. Smart guy.

39:15.561 --> 39:16.854
Speaks a lot of languages.

39:17.730 --> 39:19.273
Yes. There was one he didn't speak.

39:19.607 --> 39:22.610
Yeah, he mentioned something about that.

39:23.527 --> 39:27.698
Oh. Well, Ximena mentioned
a couple of things.

39:27.948 --> 39:29.158
- Oh, you spoke to her?
- Yeah.

39:29.367 --> 39:32.411
We had a rough start,

39:32.411 --> 39:35.623
but then, you know, we warmed up.

39:36.082 --> 39:38.250
She said that you

39:38.250 --> 39:40.169
met someone

39:40.169 --> 39:42.296
in Puerta del Sol?

39:43.464 --> 39:45.716
Huh. Isn't that where I met you?

39:46.300 --> 39:48.177
Yes, I think that it is.

39:50.721 --> 39:52.681
Oh! Also, I invented a new move
to get out of a chokehold.

39:52.890 --> 39:53.933
- Well, you got to show me.
- Yeah.

39:54.100 --> 39:55.601
Oh!

39:55.726 --> 39:57.269
That's what I did. That's exactly what...

39:57.728 --> 40:00.106
That's my move.

40:00.272 --> 40:02.566
You're becoming quite the spy,
Helen Tasker.

40:09.782 --> 40:11.492
<i>So how'd you guys do
while we were gone?</i>

40:12.660 --> 40:13.536
Fine.

40:13.702 --> 40:15.496
How was, um, wherever you were?

40:15.621 --> 40:16.539
So great.

40:16.539 --> 40:18.332
Your mom was the star of the conference.

40:18.624 --> 40:20.292
She's guest lecturing at Harvard.

40:20.543 --> 40:21.419
Cool.

40:22.628 --> 40:23.879
So, what'd you guys get into?

40:25.339 --> 40:27.967
You know, just hung out with friends.

40:31.720 --> 40:33.222
I'll get it.

40:35.850 --> 40:37.309
Hey, kitty cat.

40:37.309 --> 40:39.437
Mom, Dad, Mrs. Myers is here.

40:42.648 --> 40:44.150
It's good seeing you, sweetheart.

40:44.150 --> 40:45.526
You, too, Mrs. Myers.

40:45.526 --> 40:47.069
All right. You take care, now.

40:47.069 --> 40:49.363
- I'll see you soon, all right?
- All right.

40:49.363 --> 40:51.699
- Hi. Yay.
- Thank you, Mrs. Myers.

40:52.658 --> 40:54.076
Hope you had a good trip.

40:54.076 --> 40:55.494
Brought you cookies

40:55.494 --> 40:57.371
- and a surveillance file.
- Okay.

40:57.371 --> 40:59.957
So... photos?

40:59.957 --> 41:02.460
- Of Dana and the muscle car boy?
- Yes, dear.

41:02.460 --> 41:04.420
Is there anything on there
that we need to know about?

41:04.420 --> 41:07.381
Hmm. I would say no.
But if you're wondering

41:07.506 --> 41:09.008
if there's anything that would make you

41:09.008 --> 41:10.009
uncomfortable?

41:11.844 --> 41:13.179
Definitely.

41:13.179 --> 41:15.055
But enjoy the cookies.

41:25.065 --> 41:28.360
So, we should probably
give Dana her privacy,

41:28.360 --> 41:29.987
you know? Right?

41:29.987 --> 41:31.739
It's like Mrs. Myers said--

41:31.739 --> 41:33.491
there are some things
we don't need to know.

41:33.491 --> 41:35.117
I'm so glad we're on the same page.

41:36.619 --> 41:37.786
Me too.
