00:02.351 --> 00:04.254
Whatever they needed from you,
they have it now.

00:04.422 --> 00:07.465
It's not safe for you here anymore.
You have to go home.

00:07.633 --> 00:10.260
- You know who you are, don't you?
- What happens now?

00:12.316 --> 00:14.347
She can move between worlds.

00:14.515 --> 00:16.697
If we can learn
what she already knows...

00:16.822 --> 00:18.268
We can begin to defend ourselves.

00:18.623 --> 00:21.729
- What if her new identity doesn't hold?
- Then she'll no longer be necessary.

00:23.274 --> 00:25.759
What about our Agent Dunham?
Has she made contact?

00:26.184 --> 00:29.190
She's on the other side,
focused on the task at hand.

00:30.894 --> 00:32.573
- Good night.
- Good night.

00:48.133 --> 00:49.883
You got to be kidding me.

00:58.107 --> 00:59.107
Hello?

01:02.306 --> 01:03.696
Walter, is that you?

01:04.548 --> 01:07.174
- I can hear you breathing.
- <i>Is this Peter Bishop?</i>

01:11.911 --> 01:13.512
<i>I'm calling from New York.</i>

01:13.842 --> 01:15.299
<i>I know this is gonna sound crazy,</i>

01:15.424 --> 01:18.284
<i>but I just saw a woman
disappear in front of my eyes.</i>

01:19.274 --> 01:20.285
Who is this?

01:20.410 --> 01:23.398
<i>Her name was Olivia.
She has a message for you.</i>

01:24.283 --> 01:26.702
<i>She's trapped in the other universe.</i>

01:36.366 --> 01:37.366
Who is it?

01:42.638 --> 01:45.605
Apparently I'm eligible
for unprecedented savings.

01:47.193 --> 01:49.150
Unprecedented savings at midnight?

01:49.318 --> 01:51.068
It's never too late for savings.

01:51.623 --> 01:52.873
Apparently not.

01:53.960 --> 01:55.734
I think that you should
save their number

01:55.859 --> 01:57.835
and call them back
when they're sleeping.

02:00.220 --> 02:01.220
Blocked.

04:30.781 --> 04:31.864
What you doing?

04:32.773 --> 04:34.065
Just sending an email.

04:35.617 --> 04:36.758
At 2:15?

04:37.930 --> 04:41.739
It's not 2:15 in Greece. Thought
I'd catch up with a friend in Corinth.

04:42.609 --> 04:44.155
You got a friend in Corinth?

04:46.808 --> 04:48.280
And like he always says...

04:49.437 --> 04:52.250
<i>Na einai kalytero anthropo
apo ton patera toy.</i>

04:53.477 --> 04:54.502
What does it mean?

05:01.325 --> 05:03.358
It means:
"Be a better man than your father."

05:05.173 --> 05:08.166
His dad's not great at communicating
either, so we have that in common.

05:08.291 --> 05:09.600
I thought I'd stay in touch.

05:11.409 --> 05:13.479
I'm going back to bed.
You coming?

05:13.846 --> 05:16.065
I'll be right there.
I'm just gonna grab a glass of water.

05:49.720 --> 05:51.142
I failed the test, didn't I?

05:58.163 --> 05:59.452
What did it mean?

06:01.132 --> 06:02.195
The Greek phrase.

06:02.592 --> 06:04.454
It meant exactly
what I said it meant...

06:06.121 --> 06:07.964
But it was Olivia who said it to me,

06:08.341 --> 06:09.494
not some friend.

06:12.978 --> 06:14.347
How'd you figure me out?

06:17.193 --> 06:19.420
Had something to do
with that phone call, didn't it?

06:20.046 --> 06:21.151
How'd you do it?

06:24.510 --> 06:26.344
How'd you replace our Olivia?

06:26.786 --> 06:29.514
You were with us when we came back
from the other side, weren't you?

06:32.642 --> 06:34.261
You have a lot of questions.

06:35.040 --> 06:36.190
I understand.

06:37.024 --> 06:40.608
But you can understand
that I can't give you the answers.

06:42.225 --> 06:45.905
This from the woman in pajamas
who just shared the same bed with me.

06:46.073 --> 06:48.211
I guess answers is
where you draw the line.

06:53.900 --> 06:56.707
It's not realistic to think that
I wouldn't do what I came here to do.

07:07.517 --> 07:10.346
- Is this gonna kill me?
- Not if you do it right.

07:10.781 --> 07:12.471
Five ccs should be enough.

07:13.080 --> 07:14.419
So why are you here?

07:15.368 --> 07:16.561
What was the assignment?

07:20.942 --> 07:22.733
That's all right.
I wouldn't tell me either.

07:23.680 --> 07:26.164
'Cause if you're telling the truth
and this doesn't kill me,

07:27.357 --> 07:29.323
the last thing you want me
to have is information.

07:31.362 --> 07:32.702
You gonna come after me?

07:35.601 --> 07:38.320
- You gonna kill me?
- No, I'm gonna get answers.

07:40.584 --> 07:43.100
And if I find out
that you did anything to Olivia,

07:44.174 --> 07:45.465
then I'm going to kill you.

08:19.956 --> 08:23.345
The effects of the paralysis
will wear off in a few hours.

08:50.313 --> 08:51.313
Holy...

<i>Bon épisode...</i>

09:40.016 --> 09:41.205
Any nausea?

09:43.194 --> 09:44.333
Bit of a headache too.

09:44.641 --> 09:46.614
On a scale of one to ten?

09:48.780 --> 09:50.800
Tequila hangover
or something like that.

09:52.102 --> 09:53.302
Eight weeks...

09:53.969 --> 09:55.970
And none of us suspected anything.

09:56.138 --> 09:58.549
Did she give you any indication at all
where she was headed?

09:58.674 --> 10:01.267
- Anything you might have overlooked?
- Not that I could think of.

10:01.435 --> 10:02.792
I'll get these to the lab.

10:02.917 --> 10:06.230
I'd like some samples sent to my lab
as well as quickly as possible.

10:08.982 --> 10:11.360
Any luck running that call
that came in to my cell phone?

10:11.701 --> 10:15.065
All we know is that it was made
from a Manhattan pay phone at 12:21 AM.

10:15.190 --> 10:17.533
- No way of knowing who placed it.
- Odd.

10:17.658 --> 10:20.427
It seems that Olivia was able
to cross over momentarily,

10:20.552 --> 10:22.038
but unable to stay here.

10:22.206 --> 10:23.578
We got to get her back.

10:24.126 --> 10:25.541
So how do we get over there?

10:25.998 --> 10:28.152
Crossing over
is out of the question.

10:29.138 --> 10:30.793
Not without Olivia's help.

10:31.304 --> 10:34.258
But there may be something
I haven't thought of yet.

10:35.511 --> 10:38.202
You said she administered
the paralytic at 2:15 AM.

10:38.933 --> 10:41.182
Now what were you doing here
at 2:15 AM?

10:42.401 --> 10:43.798
Olivia called our house.

10:43.923 --> 10:46.562
She thought she heard someone
trying to enter her apartment.

10:46.730 --> 10:48.731
Walter,
you don't have to cover for me.

10:50.361 --> 10:53.861
Since we came back from over there,
we became something more than friends.

10:55.485 --> 10:56.197
I see.

10:56.982 --> 10:58.699
It's perfectly understandable, son.

11:02.969 --> 11:06.310
In the '70s, I innocently
wandered into the wrong home

11:06.435 --> 11:08.626
and it was three days
before I realized my mistake.

11:09.367 --> 11:10.911
And unlike Olivia,

11:11.036 --> 11:13.506
the woman with whom
I was sharing a bed

11:13.674 --> 11:15.240
didn't look like my wife at all.

11:15.697 --> 11:17.176
She took the wrong computer.

11:19.078 --> 11:22.247
I was searching her computer last night,
but I convinced her that it was mine.

11:22.372 --> 11:24.517
- What's on it?
- I don't know. It was encrypted.

11:25.893 --> 11:28.960
Hernandez, I want access
to every file on this computer.

11:34.984 --> 11:36.676
That's what they do, isn't it?

11:37.941 --> 11:39.463
They make you wait for 'em.

11:42.161 --> 11:43.538
I've been waiting...

11:44.008 --> 11:45.308
for seven years.

11:47.861 --> 11:51.678
Your kind isn't so good
at keeping promises.

11:52.504 --> 11:54.296
But I guess you've got it
all under control.

12:19.798 --> 12:22.354
Agent Dunham hasn't completed
her mission yet.

12:24.054 --> 12:26.870
We can't worry about that now. We need
to provide her with an extraction point.

12:27.993 --> 12:31.667
Sir, last time we swapped
an entire steel bridge with you on it.

12:31.835 --> 12:33.531
The principle is the same.

12:34.115 --> 12:36.484
You simply need to narrow
the harmonic field

12:36.609 --> 12:38.699
to focus on something smaller.

12:38.824 --> 12:40.759
A single person.
We'll use the girl.

12:41.441 --> 12:43.157
I've gotten all we need from her.

12:44.082 --> 12:46.443
And obviously
they have equivalent mass.

12:48.491 --> 12:50.232
Pull your team off
whatever they're doing.

12:50.357 --> 12:52.605
I need a time and a location
for Agent Dunham.

12:52.773 --> 12:53.731
Alive or dead?

12:57.205 --> 12:59.445
How do you want to send back
their Olivia? Alive or dead?

13:00.172 --> 13:02.756
Because I feel there are
very valuable parts for study...

13:03.668 --> 13:05.451
and I would just have
to replace her mass.

13:14.415 --> 13:15.755
He's ready for you.

13:21.267 --> 13:24.310
Someone helped her get past
our patrols onto this island.

13:26.074 --> 13:29.081
Whoever the traitor is,
they don't understand our goals.

13:29.945 --> 13:31.868
To save our world from destruction.

13:32.610 --> 13:33.660
Our people.

13:34.338 --> 13:35.488
Our families.

13:37.879 --> 13:40.325
I know that you know this
as well as I do, Phillip.

13:44.168 --> 13:47.134
For the past 20 years,
our world has been breaking apart

13:47.259 --> 13:48.744
because of what they did.

13:49.298 --> 13:52.876
And now with what we've discovered
about how that girl crosses over,

13:53.472 --> 13:55.249
we're about to turn the tide.

13:57.251 --> 13:58.833
Only one world can survive.

14:00.222 --> 14:03.425
And finally we have made strides
so that it can be ours.

14:06.180 --> 14:08.108
Our Olivia
will be returning shortly.

14:09.106 --> 14:10.975
Her mission over there
was a success.

14:12.840 --> 14:14.081
To her safe return.

14:31.070 --> 14:32.329
No, please!

14:37.059 --> 14:38.669
Please, please help me!

14:42.328 --> 14:43.328
Let me go!

14:47.262 --> 14:49.408
<i>So far,
despite his obvious eccentricities,</i>

14:49.533 --> 14:51.180
<i>Dr. Bishop has been very helpful.</i>

14:51.305 --> 14:52.182
<i>And Peter?</i>

14:52.571 --> 14:54.543
<i>He's been helpful too.
I like him.</i>

14:55.156 --> 14:56.975
So this is how she learned about us?

14:57.839 --> 15:00.766
Is there anything in there about how
she communicates with the other side?

15:01.178 --> 15:03.451
So far, besides Olivia's debriefs,

15:03.576 --> 15:06.266
just files on all the cases
we handled.

15:07.199 --> 15:09.038
I'm a fraud.
A failure.

15:09.163 --> 15:11.046
Four hours of intense meditation

15:11.171 --> 15:14.648
augmented by a precise
two-gram dose of brown Betty

15:14.773 --> 15:16.197
and I've got nothing.

15:16.833 --> 15:19.293
There is no way
to cross over safely.

15:21.051 --> 15:23.395
I'm afraid I have failed you.
I am sorry.

15:24.021 --> 15:27.467
- And I have failed Olivia.
- Walter, you haven't failed us or her.

15:30.258 --> 15:31.258
Any news?

15:31.828 --> 15:35.605
So far, our task force has recovered
17 pieces of Walternate's device.

15:35.730 --> 15:38.015
5:30 this morning,
the other Olivia used her clearance

15:38.140 --> 15:40.996
to access the aircraft hangar
where they're being stored.

15:41.121 --> 15:42.241
She took this.

15:45.445 --> 15:46.930
That explains why she's here.

15:47.055 --> 15:49.305
Walternate couldn't find all the pieces
on the other side.

15:49.430 --> 15:50.866
He sent her over to retrieve it.

15:51.422 --> 15:53.921
- What if her mission is complete?
- Then she may be going home.

15:54.046 --> 15:56.335
And not only may Walternate
be able to complete this device,

15:56.460 --> 15:59.166
but if we lose her, we lose our chance
to use her to get Olivia back.

16:02.541 --> 16:05.097
Any thoughts on how she would
cross to the other side?

16:07.130 --> 16:08.130
Nothing.

16:09.126 --> 16:12.137
And I have no idea
how to bring our Olivia back.

16:12.741 --> 16:14.765
It's all because of that temptress.

16:15.212 --> 16:18.562
She tricked my son
with her carnal manipulations

16:18.687 --> 16:20.687
and he fell right into her vagenda.

16:21.468 --> 16:22.356
"Vagenda"?

16:23.858 --> 16:26.575
Like mata hari
using her feminine wiles

16:26.700 --> 16:28.611
to accomplish her evil ends.

16:29.926 --> 16:31.426
And I too fell prey.

16:33.504 --> 16:35.805
She used my stomach...

16:37.302 --> 16:38.798
to get through to my heart.

16:44.067 --> 16:47.547
Didn't she tell she brought these back
when she went to the federal building?

16:48.643 --> 16:50.433
This bakery is in the Bronx.

16:51.366 --> 16:54.054
- Why would she go there?
- Because she must know somebody there.

16:54.505 --> 16:55.904
Let me see that address.

17:14.567 --> 17:15.951
You want new legs?

17:16.118 --> 17:18.169
There's one more thing
I need you to do for me.

17:36.730 --> 17:38.555
So why would she be coming here?

17:39.493 --> 17:41.440
Let's split up
and show her picture around.

17:43.496 --> 17:45.261
I'll take the pastry shop.

17:50.153 --> 17:51.772
- Help you?
- I hope so.

17:52.322 --> 17:55.115
I'm looking for a woman who frequents
this area. You seen her before?

17:56.773 --> 17:58.327
No. Can't say I have.

17:59.316 --> 18:00.120
You sure?

18:07.483 --> 18:08.545
Typewriters, huh?

18:10.135 --> 18:13.102
Seems like kind of a high-rent area
to be selling something so retro.

18:13.227 --> 18:15.040
People come from all over the city.

18:15.575 --> 18:17.579
I specialize in stuff
that's hard to find.

18:17.704 --> 18:18.873
I can see that.

18:24.217 --> 18:25.896
Can also see my computer right here.

18:33.051 --> 18:34.694
They promised me new legs.

18:37.505 --> 18:39.344
- How does it work?
- I don't know.

18:40.354 --> 18:43.141
No, really, I don't.
They just come here.

18:44.052 --> 18:46.078
It's a quantum entangled telegraph.

18:46.203 --> 18:48.347
It's a machine that could
communicate between universes.

18:48.472 --> 18:49.574
It's fascinating.

18:49.699 --> 18:51.890
If it works anything like
a normal typewriter...

18:58.841 --> 19:00.205
Penn station at Newark.

19:31.975 --> 19:33.588
Your money's no good here, sir.

19:34.935 --> 19:36.216
Times are tough.

19:37.013 --> 19:38.802
It's nice to know we have heroes.

19:42.514 --> 19:43.514
Thank you.

20:15.465 --> 20:17.226
I wanted to come and see you.

20:19.879 --> 20:22.387
Thank you for not giving me up.
You easily could have.

20:24.552 --> 20:25.515
How is your son?

20:26.779 --> 20:28.556
He's sleeping through
the night again.

20:30.052 --> 20:32.898
We owe that to you.
I want you to know that I realize that.

20:40.485 --> 20:43.132
Is there anything I can do
to make you more comfortable?

20:52.792 --> 20:54.328
That's not why you're here.

20:56.944 --> 20:59.758
You're here to make yourself
more comfortable.

21:01.675 --> 21:02.675
Maybe.

21:03.596 --> 21:05.630
Do you know
what they're gonna do to me?

21:11.392 --> 21:13.647
Why I have these marks
on my forehead?

21:17.209 --> 21:18.621
They're sending me back.

21:19.193 --> 21:21.445
They're gonna swap me
for your Olivia.

21:23.027 --> 21:25.367
But they're gonna kill me first.

21:27.664 --> 21:29.679
They're gonna cut out my brain....

21:31.147 --> 21:32.165
And study it.

21:37.903 --> 21:39.052
Please help me.

21:39.550 --> 21:41.841
If you can get me out of here,
I can get myself home.

21:42.010 --> 21:43.009
I can't.

21:44.406 --> 21:47.308
My world is dying because of
what your side is doing to us.

21:47.433 --> 21:48.598
If I help you escape...

21:49.207 --> 21:52.102
Despite what you think,
my universe is not at war with yours.

21:53.348 --> 21:57.105
This all began because a man
came over here to save a boy.

21:57.230 --> 22:00.906
And 25 years later,
I came back to save that same boy.

22:02.123 --> 22:05.824
But if you let me die, then
we will strike back and we will fight.

22:07.782 --> 22:09.181
But if you let me go,

22:10.679 --> 22:13.089
both universes can survive.

22:13.551 --> 22:15.520
There must be another way

22:15.645 --> 22:17.877
and I promise you I will find it.

22:21.571 --> 22:24.160
Two floors up, there's a lab there.

22:24.285 --> 22:27.554
If you can get me in there,
then I can get myself back home.

22:27.722 --> 22:29.100
And if you're lying?

22:30.840 --> 22:33.871
You'd say anything right now
because your life depends on it,

22:34.565 --> 22:37.407
but what if your side has every
intention of our destruction?

22:37.532 --> 22:39.859
Am I supposed to just hope
you're telling me the truth?

22:42.159 --> 22:43.644
If you don't trust me...

22:46.334 --> 22:47.824
then there is no hope.

22:58.177 --> 22:59.002
I'm sorry.

23:00.444 --> 23:01.444
Please.

23:01.950 --> 23:02.964
Please.

23:37.109 --> 23:38.545
So are you gonna tell me?

23:39.001 --> 23:42.001
Or are we gonna keep on pretending
that there isn't something on your mind?

23:48.329 --> 23:49.677
I have a decision to make.

23:54.342 --> 23:56.362
Remember
when I joined Fringe division?

23:58.952 --> 24:01.763
Two weeks into the job,
we had that vortex in the east river.

24:02.640 --> 24:05.527
165 people swallowed up.
Half of 'em kids.

24:08.200 --> 24:11.620
Now we may have a chance to start
to put our world back together. Fix it.

24:14.285 --> 24:15.995
Only thing is, to do that,

24:16.355 --> 24:17.848
we're gonna have to go to war.

24:17.973 --> 24:19.540
A lot of lives will be lost.

24:19.709 --> 24:21.089
An unimaginable number.

24:23.401 --> 24:25.129
And I don't know
if I can live with that.

24:29.543 --> 24:31.281
There may be another option,

24:31.406 --> 24:33.095
but it could put everything at risk.

24:33.438 --> 24:34.488
Either way,

24:35.191 --> 24:37.661
who am I to play God
with other people's lives?

24:39.937 --> 24:41.556
Who am I to make that choice?

24:45.897 --> 24:49.807
20 years ago, I knew that you were
the right man to protect our world.

24:51.233 --> 24:52.812
After all these years,

24:52.937 --> 24:54.700
I've never stopped believing that.

24:56.004 --> 24:59.485
I think this world is in
as much pain as it can stand.

25:00.872 --> 25:02.430
We need to restore hope.

25:12.256 --> 25:14.150
Tell your people
she's armed and dangerous,

25:14.275 --> 25:15.637
but she has to be taken alive.

25:15.762 --> 25:17.984
She may be the only chance
we have to recover our agent.

25:18.109 --> 25:19.219
<i>Understood, sir.</i>

25:19.344 --> 25:21.414
Good.
I'll call you when we get close.

25:23.153 --> 25:24.604
Dr. Bishop, any thoughts?

25:25.607 --> 25:26.607
Several.

25:27.885 --> 25:29.693
Not many of them pleasant, however.

25:30.266 --> 25:33.259
I meant do you have any idea
why she's headed to Penn station?

25:33.742 --> 25:36.951
She's trying to cross to the other side?
Is there a soft spot there?

25:38.476 --> 25:39.912
Not as far as I know.

25:41.973 --> 25:43.290
Peter, we'll get her.

25:44.064 --> 25:45.794
We're going to bring Olivia home.

25:47.381 --> 25:49.140
Glad you're feeling so confident.

25:50.930 --> 25:53.048
She was strong enough
to get us a message.

25:53.802 --> 25:56.626
And if there were anyone
I would bet on to survive over there,

25:57.514 --> 25:58.806
it would be her.

26:07.591 --> 26:08.591
Spin her.

26:13.202 --> 26:14.638
What's her heart rate?

26:16.427 --> 26:17.491
60 resting.

26:17.659 --> 26:19.238
Should I give her more sedative?

26:20.182 --> 26:23.967
No, if her heart rate lowers any more,
we won't be able to preserve her organs.

26:24.552 --> 26:27.278
Why don't you go prepare the coolers
in the receiving room?

26:43.356 --> 26:45.185
Excuse me!
You're not allowed to be...

27:03.006 --> 27:05.039
We don't have much time.
We have to get out of here.

27:07.186 --> 27:08.318
Come on.
Get up.

27:25.091 --> 27:26.560
You came back for me.

27:26.976 --> 27:28.979
Don't thank me yet.
I have to give you adrenaline.

27:29.148 --> 27:30.314
Please don't do...

27:41.669 --> 27:43.452
- Man, that hurt.
- Sorry.

27:44.930 --> 27:45.930
Don't be.

27:49.776 --> 27:52.419
- The ground floor? What's there?
- The lab.

27:52.588 --> 27:55.631
- They have a deprivation tank there.
- And that'll help you cross over?

27:55.800 --> 27:58.342
Yeah, it's something to do
with the lack of sensory input.

28:13.739 --> 28:14.789
What is it?

28:15.272 --> 28:17.820
I'm not positive,
but I think it's cortexiphan.

28:17.988 --> 28:19.088
What's that?

28:19.544 --> 28:20.640
It's a long story,

28:20.765 --> 28:23.216
but if I'm right, this is why
they stopped their experiments on me.

28:23.341 --> 28:26.078
'Cause they found what they needed,
it could help your people cross over.

28:36.827 --> 28:37.965
They emptied the tank.

28:39.718 --> 28:41.385
I can't cross over.

28:51.969 --> 28:54.148
- Come on. We have to go.
- No, you've done enough.

28:54.464 --> 28:56.432
If I can just get to
the other side of the island,

28:56.557 --> 28:58.675
then maybe I could swim for it.
I've done it before.

28:58.800 --> 29:01.076
- Then I've got to get to Boston.
- What's in Boston?

29:01.201 --> 29:03.076
The Secretary has a lab there
at Harvard

29:03.201 --> 29:05.076
just like my Walter Bishop
on the other side.

29:05.244 --> 29:08.413
Your Walter has a deprivation tank,
so you think the Secretary have one too?

29:08.581 --> 29:10.744
They're genetically identical,
so they think alike.

29:10.869 --> 29:12.737
It's possible.
I can't think of anything...

29:12.862 --> 29:15.247
They've changed the harbor patrols.
You'll never make it.

29:19.824 --> 29:21.357
But I can get you there.

29:21.820 --> 29:22.820
Come on.

29:27.089 --> 29:28.089
Hello?

29:28.214 --> 29:30.873
<i>Sir, there's been an incident
at Liberty Island.</i>

29:31.393 --> 29:32.926
What kind of incident?

29:33.051 --> 29:34.748
<i>Olivia Dunham is gone.</i>

29:44.533 --> 29:46.659
Here you go.
Best coffee west of the Passaic.

29:46.827 --> 29:48.155
You want cream and sugar?

29:49.238 --> 29:50.637
You can keep the change.

30:00.204 --> 30:02.553
Some things are gonna be
hard to leave behind.

30:05.887 --> 30:06.887
Come on.

30:07.324 --> 30:08.736
Time for you to go home.

30:12.776 --> 30:15.064
You know,
I sometimes dream about it.

30:15.819 --> 30:17.069
The other side.

30:17.815 --> 30:19.442
Sadly, for my kind,

30:20.054 --> 30:22.440
coming here is a one-way ticket.

30:22.987 --> 30:24.789
I thought your kind didn't care.

30:27.912 --> 30:29.811
Give me your right hand.
Palm up.

30:31.533 --> 30:33.414
Eight identities
in the last five years,

30:34.585 --> 30:36.888
but this has been my favorite.

30:38.988 --> 30:40.796
I seem to be a big hit
with the ladies.

30:43.455 --> 30:44.976
You may want to close your eyes.

30:53.280 --> 30:54.310
You spotted her?

30:54.478 --> 30:57.527
There are six entrances to the building.
We've got a team on each one of them.

30:58.740 --> 31:00.042
Don't shoot yourself.

31:01.125 --> 31:02.325
No gun for me.

31:02.858 --> 31:03.778
Good idea.

31:07.765 --> 31:09.944
Turn around,
lift up the back of your shirt.

31:16.876 --> 31:19.007
Let's split up.
You three, with me.

31:25.887 --> 31:29.011
The transfer's scheduled for 4:00.
That's in precisely 23 minutes.

31:33.981 --> 31:36.561
I'm sorry, I know you're cleaning,
but I really have to...

31:46.112 --> 31:47.321
Dunham! Freeze!

31:51.855 --> 31:54.161
I got her.
She's in the northwest bathroom.

31:59.042 --> 32:00.459
She's in there with another guy.

32:03.566 --> 32:06.173
I want two teams. One from the west
and one from the east.

32:11.991 --> 32:14.849
Put your guns down
or I will shoot her.

32:16.767 --> 32:19.562
Put your guns down
or I will kill her!

32:20.883 --> 32:22.033
Put 'em down.

32:29.007 --> 32:30.975
Oh, my God, mom!
Mom!

32:31.932 --> 32:33.409
Don't you make me kill her.

32:39.197 --> 32:40.625
What's your daughter's name?

32:44.449 --> 32:46.153
Your daughter's name!
What is it?

32:53.850 --> 32:55.681
Drop your weapon now!

32:59.988 --> 33:00.988
Take her.

33:10.906 --> 33:11.906
Where is she?

33:13.783 --> 33:15.117
Where's Olivia?

33:15.285 --> 33:16.699
Tell me how we get her back.

33:16.824 --> 33:19.163
I don't know.
That wasn't part of my assignment.

33:25.812 --> 33:27.229
Listen, whatever happens to me,

33:27.354 --> 33:30.186
I want you to know that this started out
as an assignment, but it became...

33:30.311 --> 33:31.561
Something more.

33:43.407 --> 33:46.941
That would be so much easier to believe
if you weren't in handcuffs right now.

34:03.125 --> 34:04.667
We found this in the bathroom.

34:05.089 --> 34:06.902
No sign of the component she stole.

34:07.912 --> 34:08.911
Thank you.

35:03.662 --> 35:04.939
So what do we do now?

35:23.845 --> 35:25.706
Okay, I think that's it.

35:35.312 --> 35:38.093
- They're here. How did they find us?
- Subcutaneous tracker.

35:39.345 --> 35:41.145
I'm too important to lose.

35:41.555 --> 35:42.890
Look, I've seen war.

35:43.058 --> 35:44.852
But if what you're saying is true,

35:46.020 --> 35:48.175
in the end,
I have to believe in hope.

35:48.993 --> 35:50.476
Please make this worth it.

35:53.068 --> 35:54.151
Go!

36:03.370 --> 36:06.705
<i>Colonel Broyles, you are under arrest.
Where's the girl?</i>

36:07.655 --> 36:09.105
<i>Freeze! Don't move!</i>

36:09.894 --> 36:11.135
<i>She's in the tank!</i>

36:13.283 --> 36:14.333
<i>Open it up!</i>

36:47.593 --> 36:48.593
Oh, God.

36:51.330 --> 36:54.653
I want a three-car escort, half-mile
buffer zone all the way to Boston.

37:07.296 --> 37:08.296
What?

37:09.097 --> 37:10.448
These look familiar.

37:10.862 --> 37:12.012
Familiar how?

37:13.734 --> 37:15.084
I don't know yet.

37:34.386 --> 37:36.295
E minor.
It's pretty.

37:37.287 --> 37:38.797
That was Astrid. Olivia's back.

37:39.162 --> 37:40.071
She's what?

37:40.196 --> 37:42.259
Apparently she crossed over
into your father's lab.

37:42.427 --> 37:44.803
She is in an ambulance
on their way to Boston general.

37:44.972 --> 37:46.555
Why Boston general?
Is she okay?

37:46.723 --> 37:49.183
- They think she had a seizure.
- I'm going to see Olivia.

37:50.352 --> 37:53.187
- Walter, just stay...
- No, I remember why this is familiar.

37:55.399 --> 37:56.837
They're harmonic rods.

37:56.962 --> 38:00.152
Like belly and I used to use
to help objects cross between universes.

38:00.909 --> 38:03.238
And this was found
in their Olivia's bag?

38:16.390 --> 38:17.988
I don't think you wanna see this.

38:45.572 --> 38:46.716
Check this out.

38:47.195 --> 38:49.284
No more pain.
No more burns.

38:49.672 --> 38:52.121
I'm as good as new.
It's like nothing ever happened.

38:53.562 --> 38:55.374
Just like nothing ever happened.

38:58.381 --> 38:59.842
Excuse me, Agents.

39:00.429 --> 39:03.006
Have you seen Colonel Broyles?
He's late to work this morning.

39:03.175 --> 39:04.550
Have you tried calling him?

39:04.718 --> 39:07.111
Yes, I tried calling him,
at home too,

39:07.236 --> 39:10.117
and his wife said that he did
not come home last nightand that is...

39:10.242 --> 39:11.432
very unlike him.

39:57.785 --> 40:00.185
I've never been a big fan
of needles.

40:04.694 --> 40:05.694
Doctors,

40:06.303 --> 40:07.303
needles,

40:07.927 --> 40:08.927
hospitals.

40:16.838 --> 40:17.938
Make a fist.

40:23.967 --> 40:26.670
You know, when you're a kid
and you're sick,

40:26.795 --> 40:28.345
you know, you just...

40:28.973 --> 40:30.719
you come to hate 'em all.

40:43.933 --> 40:44.933
Go ahead.

40:45.493 --> 40:46.593
Try 'em out.

40:48.113 --> 40:49.113
That's it?

40:51.573 --> 40:52.908
Only one way to find out.

41:31.902 --> 41:32.740
Thank you.

41:34.251 --> 41:35.251
Thank you.

42:26.901 --> 42:28.301
I'm sorry, Olivia.

42:31.176 --> 42:32.476
Don't apologize.

42:37.718 --> 42:40.042
You were the only thing
that got me through.

42:42.489 --> 42:45.301
If it wasn't for you,
I would never have made it back.

42:47.771 --> 42:49.171
You saved my life.
