03:01.602 --> 03:02.899
Wake up

03:03.637 --> 03:07.164
Logan, you are here. I couldn't
believe it when they told me.

03:08.776 --> 03:10.539
Logan 6.

03:10.911 --> 03:13.435
It's not every day they
authorize a new Sandman.

03:13.646 --> 03:16.171
I'll tell you, Francis, that's him.

03:16.382 --> 03:17.679
Maybe, maybe not.

03:17.884 --> 03:20.115
What does it matter?
He isn't yours anymore.

03:23.390 --> 03:25.255
All right, you want me to wake him?

03:26.794 --> 03:27.920
Break-in.

03:28.128 --> 03:29.060
Now you've done it.

03:29.263 --> 03:32.460
Scanners report intrusion. Identify.

03:32.666 --> 03:35.896
Logan 5, Francis 7,
authorized duty quadrant.

03:36.102 --> 03:38.195
Intrusion accidental.

03:38.404 --> 03:42.101
Clear, Logan 5. Clear, Francis 7.

03:45.345 --> 03:47.245
All right, Francis, I'm with you.

04:08.635 --> 04:10.899
Only the crazies hang around nursery.

04:11.104 --> 04:13.334
There'll be a couple
of new Sandmen tomorrow.

04:13.539 --> 04:14.369
How do you know?

04:14.574 --> 04:16.565
Some of our guys are
on Carrousel tonight.

04:16.776 --> 04:18.471
And Sandmen always renew. I know.

04:19.045 --> 04:20.978
But you don't know. You just assume.

04:21.178 --> 04:24.445
One for one. What everyone's
been taught. One for one.

04:24.651 --> 04:26.778
Why not? That's how everything works.

04:26.986 --> 04:30.149
Keeps everything in balance.
One is terminated, one is born.

04:30.356 --> 04:32.620
Simple, logical, perfect.

04:33.026 --> 04:36.223
- You have a better system?
- Of course not.

04:36.462 --> 04:40.626
At least I wonder about it sometimes.
Not like you with your automatic routine.

04:40.833 --> 04:43.062
You sound like a sleep
teacher with a stuck tape.

04:43.268 --> 04:45.498
Leave it alone, it's perfect.

04:51.310 --> 04:53.710
You know, Logan, you wonder a lot.

04:53.912 --> 04:55.573
Too much for a Sandman.

04:56.281 --> 04:58.147
Why were you so angry just then?

04:58.351 --> 04:59.750
What did he do to you?

04:59.952 --> 05:02.978
That red's going to
run. I can always tell.

05:03.189 --> 05:05.213
Did you ever see Francis 8?

05:05.691 --> 05:08.489
I never even visited
nursery before tonight.

05:10.062 --> 05:13.463
You know, when you
question, it slows you down.

05:15.167 --> 05:17.829
I don't know. What makes you so curious?

05:18.236 --> 05:20.295
You know who his seed-mother was?

05:20.505 --> 05:24.066
Of course not! I'm curious, not sick.

05:24.276 --> 05:25.368
Good.

05:27.511 --> 05:30.242
Look at the crowd.
Good Carrousel tonight.

05:37.889 --> 05:41.052
Last Day, Capricorn 15s.

05:41.426 --> 05:45.021
Year of the city, 2274.

05:45.230 --> 05:47.460
Carrousel begins.

05:54.939 --> 05:58.431
Last Day, Capricorn 15s.

05:58.642 --> 06:02.305
Year of the city, 2274.

06:02.513 --> 06:05.176
Carrousel begins.

06:20.264 --> 06:21.492
Would you mind?

06:22.733 --> 06:24.030
Thanks a lot.

06:34.311 --> 06:36.802
A few over there could
have been his seed-mother.

06:37.681 --> 06:38.545
Only a few?

06:39.016 --> 06:40.643
You're just not trying.

06:47.057 --> 06:48.388
Capricorn 15s...

06:49.059 --> 06:51.527
...born 2244...

06:51.729 --> 06:53.026
...enter the Carrousel.

06:54.131 --> 06:56.065
This is the time of renewal.

07:26.029 --> 07:27.519
Be strong...

07:27.730 --> 07:29.197
...and you will be renewed.

07:34.537 --> 07:36.129
Identify.

07:41.010 --> 07:42.443
Rise.

08:55.017 --> 08:56.746
Renew! Renew!

09:21.009 --> 09:21.703
Come on!

09:45.967 --> 09:46.695
Higher!

09:48.469 --> 09:50.460
Renew! Renew!

09:56.144 --> 09:57.735
Renew!

10:00.514 --> 10:02.379
Renew!

10:14.562 --> 10:16.029
Renew!

10:22.602 --> 10:24.593
Affirmative!

10:27.908 --> 10:29.000
Renew!

11:48.988 --> 11:50.147
Run, runner!

11:52.057 --> 11:54.582
Did you hear him? Run!

12:20.252 --> 12:22.550
- Hold it!
- Runner!

12:52.084 --> 12:54.575
Runner terminated, 0.31.

12:54.787 --> 12:56.254
Ready for cleanup.

13:03.528 --> 13:05.462
Request identity check.

13:11.970 --> 13:12.902
Affirmative.

13:33.591 --> 13:35.286
He was good, wasn't he?

13:35.760 --> 13:38.422
Showed he had some
life in him in the end.

13:39.530 --> 13:41.225
That was a great shot you made.

13:41.432 --> 13:43.992
You kept missing him.
I had to do something.

13:46.904 --> 13:49.270
It's crazy. He could
have renewed on Carrousel.

13:49.473 --> 13:50.963
Now he's finished forever.

13:51.175 --> 13:52.608
Why do they run?

15:26.703 --> 15:27.863
Hello.

15:30.040 --> 15:31.268
Welcome.

15:46.255 --> 15:47.745
Please, no.

15:48.624 --> 15:49.784
Please?

15:49.992 --> 15:51.254
No?

15:54.931 --> 15:56.091
Come on.

16:05.040 --> 16:06.439
What's wrong?

16:07.776 --> 16:08.674
You prefer women?

16:12.081 --> 16:13.309
Well?

16:15.551 --> 16:17.883
Nothing, I felt sad.

16:18.087 --> 16:20.214
I put myself on the circuit.

16:20.488 --> 16:21.785
It was a mistake.

16:21.990 --> 16:23.423
Sad?

16:24.125 --> 16:25.217
Why do you feel sad?

16:25.927 --> 16:28.123
A friend of mine went on Carrousel.

16:28.630 --> 16:29.688
Now he's gone.

16:30.966 --> 16:31.933
Yes, well...

16:32.134 --> 16:33.567
...I'm sure he was renewed.

16:34.203 --> 16:35.602
He was killed.

16:35.804 --> 16:36.702
Like the others.

16:37.239 --> 16:39.104
Killed? Why do you use that word?

16:39.708 --> 16:41.539
Isn't that what you do? Kill?

16:49.050 --> 16:51.348
I've never killed anyone in my life.

16:51.552 --> 16:53.486
Sandmen terminate runners.

16:55.056 --> 16:56.455
What's your name?

16:57.458 --> 16:58.550
Jessica.

17:00.428 --> 17:01.828
That's sad enough.

17:02.031 --> 17:03.328
You're beautiful.

17:03.532 --> 17:05.227
Let's have sex.

17:05.434 --> 17:07.195
Then why are you wasting my time?

17:07.402 --> 17:09.063
Why'd you put yourself on the circuit?

17:10.538 --> 17:12.768
I thought I had to do something.

17:13.241 --> 17:15.106
I told you it was a mistake...

17:15.309 --> 17:17.277
...and I've changed my mind.

17:17.478 --> 17:19.412
Because I'm a Sandman?

17:20.048 --> 17:21.378
Am I your first?

17:21.582 --> 17:22.810
Yes.

17:23.917 --> 17:25.579
And I'm curious.

17:25.787 --> 17:27.152
About what?

17:27.355 --> 17:28.878
How a Sandman lives.

17:29.089 --> 17:31.387
It's a little different
from most people...

17:31.591 --> 17:35.119
...but I assure you we have the
same feelings as everybody else.

17:35.596 --> 17:37.188
If you're feeling curious it's-

17:37.398 --> 17:38.888
Not about that.

17:39.100 --> 17:39.930
What, then?

17:42.136 --> 17:43.967
Why is it wrong to run?

17:48.709 --> 17:50.540
You shouldn't think such things...

17:50.911 --> 17:52.310
...let alone talk about them.

17:53.146 --> 17:55.614
Look, you know what to do.

17:56.817 --> 17:58.375
You try like hell for renewal.

17:58.585 --> 18:01.816
Otherwise, when this
turns to black, that's it.

18:03.256 --> 18:06.556
But if for some strange
reason you want to be 31...

18:06.761 --> 18:08.786
...then you have the
same chance as everyone.

18:09.297 --> 18:10.229
Like your friend.

18:10.998 --> 18:11.828
Carrousel.

18:14.734 --> 18:15.723
But...

18:17.304 --> 18:19.795
...if you're one of the misfits...

18:21.808 --> 18:23.036
...that's where I come in.

18:23.243 --> 18:25.040
I didn't say that I would run.

18:25.245 --> 18:26.542
I just...

18:28.915 --> 18:30.610
How old are you?

18:30.817 --> 18:32.546
I'm a 6.

18:32.752 --> 18:34.652
I go red next year.

18:37.223 --> 18:39.248
You're years away.

18:41.995 --> 18:43.326
What quad do you live in?

18:43.530 --> 18:44.758
IK.

18:46.733 --> 18:48.860
You're quite sure you don't want to...?

18:50.504 --> 18:52.665
It's nice to know you can nod.

18:53.940 --> 18:56.306
It's nice to know you can do that too.

18:58.677 --> 19:00.406
I've been looking all over for you.

19:02.648 --> 19:03.842
We're having a party, right?

19:04.083 --> 19:05.072
Hey, Francis.

19:05.351 --> 19:06.784
They're great.

19:11.257 --> 19:12.452
Let's fade out.

19:16.796 --> 19:18.627
Give me my screamer back.

19:18.832 --> 19:20.424
They're mine now.

19:30.176 --> 19:31.108
What happened?

19:31.310 --> 19:33.540
- I lost a runner in Cathedral.
- How come?

19:33.746 --> 19:35.111
Ran into some cubs.

19:35.414 --> 19:37.211
One of them cut me all the way down.

19:37.850 --> 19:38.817
Cubs.

19:39.084 --> 19:40.574
I'm off to New You for repairs.

19:40.853 --> 19:44.185
Get yourself a new face while
you're at it. They know you now.

19:46.292 --> 19:49.125
I might look in on the
New You myself. Number 483.

19:49.595 --> 19:51.756
- You? Why?
- It's that last runner.

19:51.964 --> 19:53.898
He got a face change on Last Day.

19:54.099 --> 19:56.329
If so, someone in 483
was trying to help him.

19:56.535 --> 19:57.934
Check it out.

20:00.039 --> 20:02.599
Got a runner in power center.

20:06.678 --> 20:07.838
What's with you?

20:08.046 --> 20:09.536
Last night.

20:09.747 --> 20:11.078
You had a kicker.

20:11.282 --> 20:13.182
She must have got him in the head.

20:33.338 --> 20:34.430
Identify.

20:37.308 --> 20:38.832
Clear, Francis 7.

20:46.251 --> 20:48.549
There goes another one.

20:51.723 --> 20:54.658
Why do they run instead
of going on Carrousel?

20:56.361 --> 20:57.726
Good one.

20:59.030 --> 21:00.725
Runner terminated, power center.

21:02.033 --> 21:05.628
7106, identification correct.

21:09.207 --> 21:11.903
- See you in the hydro toner.
- Be right with you.

21:55.018 --> 21:55.916
Logan 5...

21:57.088 --> 21:59.521
...approach and identify.

22:09.232 --> 22:12.099
Sit facing the screen, Logan 5.

22:19.343 --> 22:20.901
Identify.

22:41.064 --> 22:43.827
Do you identify this object?

22:49.672 --> 22:50.969
Negative.

22:52.074 --> 22:53.473
Question: What is it?

22:54.009 --> 22:56.569
That is the name of the object. Ankh.

23:00.883 --> 23:03.409
Do you identify this word...

23:03.620 --> 23:05.247
"... Sanctuary"?

23:07.289 --> 23:08.586
Negative.

23:10.092 --> 23:12.890
Sanctuary is a pre
- catastrophe code word...

23:13.095 --> 23:15.563
...used for a place of immunity.

23:18.667 --> 23:19.998
I don't understand.

23:20.202 --> 23:21.294
The object ankh...

23:21.570 --> 23:25.631
...has been identified with
the code word "Sanctuary. "

23:26.041 --> 23:28.100
The object and the word both relate...

23:28.310 --> 23:31.801
...to runners who have
not been accounted for.

23:35.216 --> 23:36.479
- Question-
- Hold.

23:38.187 --> 23:41.020
Unaccounted runners: 1056.

23:42.358 --> 23:44.485
You may state your question.

23:44.994 --> 23:47.224
1056 unaccounted for?

23:47.563 --> 23:49.053
The number is correct.

23:50.533 --> 23:52.193
That's impossible.

23:53.234 --> 23:56.294
Question: Maybe they
weren't all runners.

23:56.504 --> 23:59.473
Maybe most of them reached
life renewal on Carrousel.

24:03.545 --> 24:04.910
Question:

24:05.847 --> 24:07.246
Nobody reached renewal?

24:11.687 --> 24:14.553
But everybody believes that some-

24:14.756 --> 24:16.053
The question was answered.

24:20.295 --> 24:23.731
You mean, nobody's ever been renewed?

24:24.098 --> 24:26.259
The question has been answered.

24:29.604 --> 24:32.038
You are authorized to
penetrate city seals...

24:32.240 --> 24:34.470
...and search outside the dome.

24:34.843 --> 24:36.105
The seals?

24:36.477 --> 24:38.707
Question: What seals?

24:39.146 --> 24:40.579
Outside?

24:41.449 --> 24:42.916
There's nothing outside.

24:43.384 --> 24:46.876
You will find Sanctuary and destroy.

24:49.991 --> 24:51.185
Question:

24:51.392 --> 24:53.758
What if I need help
from another Sandman?

24:54.295 --> 24:57.230
Negative. You will begin
assignment by becoming...

24:57.432 --> 24:59.626
...a runner seeking Sanctuary.

24:59.833 --> 25:01.164
Question:

25:02.402 --> 25:04.199
I'm only red six now.

25:04.738 --> 25:07.070
How can I pretend that
I'm approaching Last Day?

25:08.408 --> 25:10.501
Identify.

25:55.856 --> 25:57.687
My life clock.

25:59.560 --> 26:01.585
Question: My life clock?

26:04.364 --> 26:06.389
Retrogram complete.

26:06.666 --> 26:09.191
Procedure 033-03.

26:10.236 --> 26:13.535
But am I still red 6?

26:16.142 --> 26:18.337
I had four more years.

26:19.245 --> 26:21.305
I will get them back, won't I?

26:21.915 --> 26:25.373
You will take the object ankh
with you for identification.

26:26.853 --> 26:28.252
Question:

26:29.455 --> 26:31.616
Do I get my four years back?

27:45.030 --> 27:46.622
What the hell took you so long?

27:46.831 --> 27:47.763
It was...

27:47.966 --> 27:49.297
...the debriefing.

27:50.468 --> 27:52.800
It was more complicated than usual.

27:53.004 --> 27:55.165
Come on, get in the water.

28:00.011 --> 28:01.911
Did you ever see anybody renew?

28:04.616 --> 28:08.279
You've been skulling out too much.
First nursery, and now silly questions.

28:08.486 --> 28:10.545
But did you?

28:11.823 --> 28:12.653
Did I what?

28:12.957 --> 28:13.946
See anybody renewed?

28:14.492 --> 28:15.823
Of course.

28:17.829 --> 28:18.818
Anybody we know?

28:20.365 --> 28:21.457
Look...

28:21.666 --> 28:23.098
...get into the water.

28:23.333 --> 28:25.961
You need it more than I do.

28:26.270 --> 28:27.601
Francis, I have to talk to you.

28:30.507 --> 28:31.269
I'll see you.

28:42.921 --> 28:44.218
Here I am.

28:44.421 --> 28:46.048
Now tell me why.

28:46.223 --> 28:47.713
I couldn't get you out of my mind.

28:47.925 --> 28:50.120
I'm the most beautiful woman
you ever saw, I suppose.

28:51.395 --> 28:52.293
Maybe.

28:52.596 --> 28:55.656
- And you must have me?
- Yes. Something like that.

28:55.866 --> 28:58.801
- Just like that?
- Yes, why not?

28:59.336 --> 29:00.928
But I still have the choice?

29:01.939 --> 29:02.837
Of course.

29:03.707 --> 29:05.767
Then the answer's still no.

29:07.144 --> 29:08.577
No, I don't believe you.

29:09.646 --> 29:12.672
- That's why you had me brought here?
- Would you have come on your own?

29:12.883 --> 29:15.408
Well, there it is. I was right.

29:18.956 --> 29:21.288
You can have any woman in the city.

29:22.025 --> 29:23.287
What do you really want?

29:29.365 --> 29:30.559
Why show me?

29:30.767 --> 29:32.257
Because I'm going to run.

29:33.603 --> 29:34.865
Why tell me?

29:35.071 --> 29:36.732
You know something.

29:39.510 --> 29:41.410
About running? Dying, what?

29:41.612 --> 29:45.548
Both. But running is
what I'm interested in.

29:45.749 --> 29:47.979
I know what everyone knows.

29:48.185 --> 29:51.677
Try like hell for renewal. You have the
same chance as anyone else. Carrousel.

29:51.888 --> 29:55.585
Look, don't you understand? It's
different now because it's me!

29:55.825 --> 29:57.087
My life.

29:59.162 --> 30:00.060
Help me.

30:01.964 --> 30:03.261
How can I?

30:08.504 --> 30:09.562
Where'd you get that?

30:10.774 --> 30:12.071
I got it from a runner.

30:12.309 --> 30:13.867
And then you killed him.

30:14.077 --> 30:15.737
It was my job.

30:15.945 --> 30:17.207
But now...

30:18.147 --> 30:19.114
...it's different.

30:19.315 --> 30:20.612
Believe me.

30:22.051 --> 30:23.177
I don't.

30:23.753 --> 30:25.618
Speak to your friends for me.

30:26.122 --> 30:27.214
What friends?

30:27.423 --> 30:29.015
Look, I don't have much time!

30:29.492 --> 30:31.585
I never heard of a
Sandman running, ever.

30:33.329 --> 30:35.388
And I never heard of Sanctuary.

31:14.669 --> 31:17.605
First level, near the hand.

31:19.108 --> 31:21.576
Don't look for us, we'll see you.

31:22.344 --> 31:24.812
You don't seem quite sure, Jessica.

31:25.080 --> 31:26.104
Can you do it?

31:26.548 --> 31:27.845
Will you?

31:29.718 --> 31:30.650
Tonight?

31:32.254 --> 31:33.186
Yes.

31:33.622 --> 31:35.590
I'm sorry, Jessica.

31:35.790 --> 31:37.314
We all are.

31:37.859 --> 31:40.384
But he has heard about Sanctuary.

31:40.629 --> 31:43.621
And that makes him
dangerous to all of us.

31:44.532 --> 31:45.964
Doesn't it?

31:53.275 --> 31:55.675
Oh, thanks, Francis. I can use a break.

31:56.411 --> 31:58.276
Just don't take forever, like last time.

31:58.480 --> 32:02.075
You love it. You're afraid
you'll miss a really good run.

32:23.872 --> 32:24.896
You spoke to them?

32:26.574 --> 32:27.506
Them?

32:30.945 --> 32:31.912
Why are you here?

32:35.215 --> 32:36.477
I'm here to help you.

32:37.751 --> 32:39.719
Come with me to Arcade.

33:05.746 --> 33:06.872
Wait, Logan.

33:08.415 --> 33:09.245
We have to talk.

33:09.750 --> 33:10.876
Yes, we have to.

33:14.021 --> 33:14.918
What is it?

33:15.188 --> 33:17.247
A runner. In Cathedral.

33:17.991 --> 33:19.618
A woman. Come on.

33:26.466 --> 33:27.627
You better go home.

33:27.835 --> 33:29.803
I'd rather be with you.

33:32.806 --> 33:34.171
Logan's got a mean one tonight.

33:34.375 --> 33:36.400
- Cathedral. I better help him.
- Watch out.

33:36.610 --> 33:39.077
Careful, they'll cut you to
pieces before you see them.

34:02.135 --> 34:04.831
Are the cubs really as wild as they say?

34:06.072 --> 34:07.437
Never been there, have you?

34:07.640 --> 34:09.164
No, of course not.

34:09.909 --> 34:13.174
You wanted to come with
me. You'll find out.

34:14.714 --> 34:16.409
They're wild, all right.

34:16.815 --> 34:19.944
They're the violent ones. There's no
place else for them, unless they change.

34:21.987 --> 34:24.547
People say it's because
they're born in breeders.

34:24.755 --> 34:25.813
Had you heard that?

34:26.190 --> 34:28.318
We're all born in breeders.

34:28.560 --> 34:31.654
But most of us don't end up
running wild in Cathedral.

34:32.364 --> 34:35.801
No, but they say human
mothering might be better.

34:38.504 --> 34:40.335
I wish I'd known my mother.

34:44.577 --> 34:46.543
Where do you get these crazy ideas?

34:48.612 --> 34:50.444
When did you begin to question Last Day?

34:52.083 --> 34:53.710
I didn't say I questioned it.

34:54.985 --> 34:55.850
Do you?

34:58.256 --> 35:00.451
Entering a reservation
for violent delinquents.

35:01.726 --> 35:03.125
Authorized persons only.

35:22.314 --> 35:24.839
I've never been in this quadrant before.

35:28.887 --> 35:31.286
Request door open, Cathedral Plaza.

35:31.489 --> 35:33.753
Logan 5 authorized to enter risk area.

35:33.958 --> 35:35.823
They shut it to keep in the cubs.

35:39.631 --> 35:41.428
Let me go first.

35:43.201 --> 35:45.533
Sometimes they're
waiting just inside there.

35:47.739 --> 35:49.730
Quick, before it closes.

36:22.973 --> 36:24.873
Don't be afraid.

36:27.711 --> 36:28.735
What's your name?

36:29.413 --> 36:30.744
Mary 2.

36:32.082 --> 36:33.049
Where do you live?

36:33.250 --> 36:34.512
Here.

36:37.921 --> 36:39.115
Why aren't you in nursery?

36:39.889 --> 36:41.948
I'm very smart.

36:42.225 --> 36:43.123
When are you green?

36:44.194 --> 36:45.127
When do you go up?

36:46.363 --> 36:48.888
I never go upstairs.

36:50.167 --> 36:52.397
You're a nice old lady.

36:57.007 --> 36:58.167
No, don't.

36:58.375 --> 36:59.967
Might be a decoy.

37:27.537 --> 37:28.629
Runner!

37:41.784 --> 37:43.046
Watch out!

37:45.420 --> 37:47.786
Circle! Circle!

37:48.023 --> 37:49.456
Get behind them.

37:50.192 --> 37:51.421
Don't let them get away.

37:52.161 --> 37:53.321
Billy, come on!

37:53.529 --> 37:55.497
Billy, we've got one!

37:56.866 --> 37:58.891
We've got a runner and his pair-up.

37:59.535 --> 38:01.127
And look who decided to run.

38:02.138 --> 38:03.332
I cut up a Sandman yesterday.

38:04.774 --> 38:07.140
They said I'd never get
him, but I cut him up good.

38:07.876 --> 38:09.503
I feel sorry for you, boy.

38:09.878 --> 38:11.209
For me?

38:11.580 --> 38:13.480
You better feel sorry for yourself.

38:14.783 --> 38:17.343
I feel sorry for you, Billy.

38:17.552 --> 38:18.849
How old are you?

38:19.054 --> 38:20.817
14? 15?

38:21.023 --> 38:23.993
Your time is running out here.
How long have you got left here?

38:24.260 --> 38:28.253
A year, six months? What happens
when you're 16 and you go to green?

38:28.698 --> 38:32.394
Nothing will happen. Nothing!
I make the rules here.

38:32.601 --> 38:34.501
No cubs over 15, Billy!

38:34.803 --> 38:38.261
Look, have you ever seen a
cub who's turned to green?

38:38.840 --> 38:40.000
You'll have to leave then...

38:40.208 --> 38:42.608
...because they won't let you stay here.

38:43.211 --> 38:45.611
And if you do try and stay here...

38:45.814 --> 38:48.783
...your young friends here
will rip your guts apart!

38:53.254 --> 38:54.585
Muscle!

38:59.328 --> 39:02.456
All right, children, playtime's over.

39:10.138 --> 39:12.470
How many of you want
this to be Last Day?

39:14.042 --> 39:15.134
Come on, we can rush him!

39:18.179 --> 39:19.942
Come on, we can take him again!

39:30.926 --> 39:32.985
Come on! Cut me!

40:20.141 --> 40:21.130
Runner?

40:33.019 --> 40:35.614
There's been a terrible error.

40:35.890 --> 40:39.417
My life clock must
have broken in some way.

40:39.627 --> 40:41.151
I'm nowhere near 30.

40:42.463 --> 40:43.452
I'm 22.

40:43.798 --> 40:46.561
I should be green.
Did you hear me? Green!

40:46.766 --> 40:49.735
- Now, don't be afraid!
- Let me go! Let me go!

40:49.936 --> 40:52.632
I am not going to hurt you.

40:52.839 --> 40:54.272
Now, look.

40:54.474 --> 40:55.532
There.

40:55.742 --> 40:57.642
There. See?

41:00.680 --> 41:02.045
We want to help you.

41:09.055 --> 41:09.817
Sanctuary?

41:18.765 --> 41:20.824
This means nothing to you?

41:23.503 --> 41:24.595
Listen...

41:25.505 --> 41:28.133
...if they find you, throw
this hard enough to break it.

41:28.341 --> 41:30.900
But remember, don't
breathe until you get away.

41:31.677 --> 41:33.269
It's blind gas.

41:49.762 --> 41:50.751
Runner?

41:58.770 --> 42:01.102
Runner terminated at 0. 16.

42:01.306 --> 42:04.104
Ready for clean up,
Cathedral quadrant 39.

42:07.646 --> 42:11.776
I must tell you now. When we were in
Arcade, I was taking you to be killed.

42:13.886 --> 42:15.979
I'm sorry, I didn't believe you.

42:19.057 --> 42:21.321
But you do now?

42:21.527 --> 42:23.017
Of course.

42:23.228 --> 42:24.661
You let the runner go.

42:24.863 --> 42:26.728
Then tell me where Sanctuary is.

42:26.932 --> 42:28.627
Take me to your friends.

42:28.834 --> 42:31.394
I can't tell you.

42:31.837 --> 42:33.737
And if I take you to
them, they'll kill you.

42:33.939 --> 42:35.930
But you saw me let her go. Tell them.

42:36.141 --> 42:38.166
They won't listen. You're a Sandman.

42:38.376 --> 42:40.241
They won't take the chance.

42:45.850 --> 42:48.217
Request maze car, Cathedral Plaza.

42:48.620 --> 42:50.019
Stand by to open door.

43:12.143 --> 43:12.871
It's open.

43:13.511 --> 43:15.138
Come on, we got to go.

43:21.587 --> 43:23.020
Where will you go now?

43:23.221 --> 43:24.517
Back to Arcade.

43:24.722 --> 43:26.519
I'm going to get a new face.

43:26.724 --> 43:28.521
But you can't, you're a runner.

43:28.726 --> 43:30.023
No one will do it.

43:30.227 --> 43:32.252
There's New You 483.

43:32.463 --> 43:34.294
I think there's someone
there can help me.

43:35.299 --> 43:36.561
Maybe there is.

43:51.915 --> 43:54.350
The cheeks could be
narrowed, the mouth changed...

43:54.919 --> 43:57.319
Please let me know as soon
as you've made your selection.

43:58.956 --> 44:01.424
I'll let you know as
soon as she's decided.

44:05.630 --> 44:07.530
Hello, Sandman.

44:08.565 --> 44:10.055
We don't get many Sandmen.

44:10.266 --> 44:13.064
I think we've had only
one since I've been here.

44:13.269 --> 44:15.965
A Sandman can get as sick
of his face as anyone else.

44:16.172 --> 44:19.573
Doc, there's a Sandman
here. Can you see him?

44:22.245 --> 44:24.372
Doc is ready, Sandman.

44:26.517 --> 44:29.953
I recommend a more detailed
study of our projections.

44:30.154 --> 44:33.452
There are new suggestions
for your consideration...

44:37.494 --> 44:40.952
- This is a real privilege, Sandman.
- For me too.

44:44.567 --> 44:46.398
I thought you'd be older.

44:46.603 --> 44:48.434
I mean, I was expecting a red.

44:49.372 --> 44:50.532
I am.

44:51.908 --> 44:52.772
Your own work?

44:53.276 --> 44:54.936
Yes, I did it myself.

44:56.945 --> 44:58.276
Right on there.

44:59.449 --> 45:00.746
I'll show you.

45:05.455 --> 45:07.616
This is the Aesculaptor Mark 3.

45:07.824 --> 45:10.816
The latest. It's
completely self-contained.

45:13.229 --> 45:15.754
It has a tilt bed and
cryojectors in the platform.

45:20.969 --> 45:22.630
Well, Sandman, what will it be?

45:22.838 --> 45:25.170
Face job? Full-body job?

45:25.374 --> 45:26.500
Just the face.

45:26.709 --> 45:28.643
Fine, Holly'll get you ready.

45:29.111 --> 45:31.170
You're in expert hands.

45:31.848 --> 45:33.247
Believe me.

45:40.055 --> 45:42.387
Will you get on the table, please?

45:43.625 --> 45:45.115
Want me to take my clothes off?

45:45.327 --> 45:46.954
Not for your face.

45:50.499 --> 45:52.467
You shouldn't have brought him here.

45:53.669 --> 45:55.637
I didn't bring him.

45:56.472 --> 45:58.133
What's the difference?

45:58.907 --> 46:00.340
He's blinking.

46:01.843 --> 46:03.276
He wants to run.

46:03.845 --> 46:05.040
Run?

46:05.247 --> 46:06.680
He's a Sandman.

46:10.319 --> 46:12.787
I tell you, he's running. I know.

46:13.222 --> 46:14.382
Maybe.

46:14.923 --> 46:17.153
I just wish he'd gone somewhere else.

46:18.994 --> 46:20.359
All right, he gets a face.

46:20.763 --> 46:22.788
I like dark hair.

46:23.165 --> 46:25.394
Tell him to give you dark hair.

46:26.267 --> 46:27.734
All set?

46:28.369 --> 46:30.564
Did you have anything special in mind?

46:30.972 --> 46:31.836
I don't care, just-

46:32.540 --> 46:34.303
Dark hair.

46:35.309 --> 46:36.742
Oh, yes.

46:37.178 --> 46:39.409
Holly would like dark hair.

46:40.749 --> 46:42.910
We'll start by narrowing the cheekbones.

47:03.371 --> 47:05.896
With this, there's no
waiting for scar burnishing.

47:06.240 --> 47:08.037
It's all in one.

47:08.342 --> 47:09.569
Watch now.

47:11.679 --> 47:13.010
Here's the improvement.

47:13.548 --> 47:16.517
Instant healing before you feel a thing.

47:20.087 --> 47:21.486
Hello, yes?

47:21.889 --> 47:23.288
Yes, they are.

47:27.762 --> 47:28.990
Done.

47:33.700 --> 47:34.962
Pay attention, Sandman.

47:35.635 --> 47:37.296
I'm proud of this machine.

47:39.506 --> 47:42.441
Perfect depth adjustment on this one.

47:42.642 --> 47:46.101
The beam will cut through that uniform
and just through the skin beneath.

47:46.547 --> 47:47.980
Absolute precision.

47:48.783 --> 47:50.114
Watch now.

47:54.988 --> 47:56.956
Just imagine what would happen...

47:57.157 --> 47:59.591
...if the healing stopped functioning.

48:05.031 --> 48:07.226
Doc, the machine is spinning!

48:07.434 --> 48:08.458
Right! It's a trap.

48:08.668 --> 48:09.498
They know.

48:13.173 --> 48:14.367
I'm a runner!

48:41.667 --> 48:44.227
- What's going on?
- Get out of my way! Get off me!

48:45.437 --> 48:48.770
What are you talking about?
I saw you let a runner go.

48:50.710 --> 48:51.802
In Cathedral.

48:52.012 --> 48:52.910
I was there!

49:09.895 --> 49:10.827
Follow me.

49:11.030 --> 49:12.395
Stay close.

49:13.332 --> 49:15.300
We've got to go through the Love Shop.

49:46.965 --> 49:47.795
Where'd they go?

49:47.999 --> 49:49.899
A Sandman and a green?

49:50.168 --> 49:51.863
Didn't you see them?

52:05.301 --> 52:08.396
- Why do you run from your friend?
- Because he is my friend.

52:08.772 --> 52:12.071
I don't want to be killed
by him, or anyone else.

52:12.275 --> 52:13.799
He's good, isn't he?

52:14.277 --> 52:18.680
You mean, will he find us and kill
us? Yes. Or one of the others will.

52:19.116 --> 52:21.346
You know, they won't believe us.

52:21.551 --> 52:25.111
Maybe not. But I'd rather take my
chance with them than with Francis.

52:25.321 --> 52:26.515
They won't listen.

52:27.189 --> 52:28.850
Do you think Sandmen will?

52:30.993 --> 52:32.517
There's no other way for me.

52:34.296 --> 52:35.388
We'll convince them.

53:14.203 --> 53:15.670
You better stay behind me.

53:15.871 --> 53:17.532
How will they know we're coming?

53:18.007 --> 53:19.702
They're watching us now.

53:21.076 --> 53:22.976
They'll let us in when they're sure.

53:32.253 --> 53:33.982
There, 17th Quadrant IK.

53:34.189 --> 53:35.554
- Whose signal?
- Logan 5.

53:35.757 --> 53:38.385
- Who's available?
-7, 9 and Arcade Patrol.

53:38.660 --> 53:42.118
Sandman, put your hands on your head.

53:43.431 --> 53:45.798
Clasp your fingers together.

53:46.001 --> 53:48.834
Now turn your hands over. Palms up.

53:50.406 --> 53:52.966
In a moment, a light
will shine in your eyes.

53:53.175 --> 53:56.974
Walk into it. Jessica
first. Then you, Sandman.

53:57.178 --> 54:00.170
You will have to stoop, but
don't unclasp your hands.

54:00.381 --> 54:01.871
Do you agree?

54:14.696 --> 54:16.687
Move against the pillar.

54:17.364 --> 54:18.798
Up against it!

54:25.940 --> 54:27.532
Look, I'm a runner.

54:29.043 --> 54:31.773
She brought me here because
I begged her to help me.

54:34.082 --> 54:37.609
- He's lying.
- No Sandman ever ran.

54:37.819 --> 54:39.513
You don't run.

54:39.720 --> 54:40.709
You kill runners.

54:40.921 --> 54:42.650
You have always killed runners.

54:42.856 --> 54:44.551
Yes, I have.

54:45.158 --> 54:46.887
But now it's my turn.

54:47.527 --> 54:49.188
And I find I want to live.

54:49.630 --> 54:50.996
What's the matter with you?

54:51.299 --> 54:53.995
He's a runner! He's blinking!

54:54.535 --> 54:57.402
We must help anyone who asks. We must!

54:58.273 --> 55:01.208
Or we're the same as they are,
deciding who lives or dies!

55:10.050 --> 55:12.883
Holly. Holly New You 483.

55:13.086 --> 55:14.485
He's dead. Doc is dead.

55:14.821 --> 55:16.311
And the Sandman came.

55:18.125 --> 55:19.114
It's him!

55:19.326 --> 55:20.224
He killed Doc.

55:21.728 --> 55:22.786
Wait!

55:23.665 --> 55:25.291
He's running.

55:25.799 --> 55:26.823
Tell them the rest!

55:27.067 --> 55:28.329
He's the one.

55:28.535 --> 55:30.298
And you, too. I remember.

55:30.504 --> 55:31.937
He was in a hurry.

55:32.139 --> 55:33.436
A face job only.

55:33.640 --> 55:36.040
And I said, dark hair.

55:36.243 --> 55:37.904
And then he killed Doc...

55:38.111 --> 55:40.841
...and you grabbed me and
the machine blew up and I ran.

55:41.281 --> 55:42.111
I ran.

55:44.117 --> 55:45.607
Holly, please!

55:46.453 --> 55:48.386
The other Sandman.

55:48.788 --> 55:49.720
Remember?

55:51.090 --> 55:52.921
The one who came after?

56:01.234 --> 56:02.758
That's right.

56:03.704 --> 56:05.296
The other one came after.

56:06.640 --> 56:10.040
And he was hunting the
first one, wasn't he?

56:10.976 --> 56:12.273
Wasn't he?

56:13.245 --> 56:14.803
This one was running...

56:15.014 --> 56:18.381
...and the other one was
hunting him, remember?

56:25.392 --> 56:27.223
He was after you.

56:29.162 --> 56:30.892
I remember.

56:31.999 --> 56:33.295
You were running.

56:41.708 --> 56:44.108
I say we pass them through.

56:53.487 --> 56:54.748
Runner...

56:54.954 --> 56:57.320
...follow the corridor
with the pipes overhead.

56:57.723 --> 57:00.021
The way is always down.

57:00.226 --> 57:02.752
Then this isn't Sanctuary?

57:02.963 --> 57:05.124
No, you must follow the tunnel...

57:05.332 --> 57:06.492
...to the end.

57:07.834 --> 57:09.461
Where do I go from there?

57:09.669 --> 57:12.433
When you come to the lock,
there will be a message.

57:12.939 --> 57:15.464
After that, there's no turning back.

57:15.675 --> 57:18.472
No. Jessica goes back now.

57:19.712 --> 57:20.679
Do you hear me?

57:20.880 --> 57:21.938
You must go back now.

57:24.083 --> 57:25.550
No, I'm going with you.

57:26.419 --> 57:29.388
No, it's not possible.
No, you must go back.

57:29.688 --> 57:31.280
Somebody take her back.

57:31.490 --> 57:33.458
See that she gets out of here.

57:35.094 --> 57:36.221
Please...

57:36.430 --> 57:37.454
...it's dangerous.

57:38.064 --> 57:39.531
I don't care.

57:40.599 --> 57:42.499
I want to go to Sanctuary.

57:42.701 --> 57:43.827
Take me with you?

57:44.904 --> 57:47.600
Jessica, why?

57:47.807 --> 57:50.037
You're still a green.
You're not running.

57:51.277 --> 57:53.211
It doesn't matter what I am.

57:53.646 --> 57:55.136
I want to be with you.

58:41.160 --> 58:42.627
Listen to me!

58:43.796 --> 58:47.663
I'm your friend. I understand.
We all go crazy once in a while.

58:48.600 --> 58:52.229
Nobody knows except me. I won't tell.
I could have turned you in. I didn't.

58:53.938 --> 58:54.962
But she's a runner.

58:56.508 --> 58:57.770
And it's over.

58:58.610 --> 59:01.443
Terminate her! Now!

59:03.147 --> 59:04.944
You're a Sandman! Now, Logan. Now!

59:05.517 --> 59:06.484
Stay out of it!

59:40.517 --> 59:42.178
What do we do now?

59:43.820 --> 59:46.015
Runner, this is the last gate.

59:46.223 --> 59:47.657
Use your key now.

59:47.859 --> 59:50.987
When the bell sounds
again, use your key.

59:51.195 --> 59:54.130
Good luck, runner.
May you find Sanctuary.

01:00:07.411 --> 01:00:09.504
I still have the key
I took from the runner.

01:00:09.780 --> 01:00:10.712
There.

01:00:59.596 --> 01:01:01.621
We must be somewhere under the city.

01:01:02.366 --> 01:01:05.391
I'd always heard the city
received its power from the sea...

01:01:05.601 --> 01:01:07.159
...but this looks forgotten.

01:01:07.370 --> 01:01:08.894
Unused.

01:01:31.394 --> 01:01:33.487
Runner, this is the last gate.

01:01:33.696 --> 01:01:35.129
Use your key now.

01:01:35.331 --> 01:01:36.525
When the bell sounds...

01:01:45.408 --> 01:01:47.103
What do you suppose this was?

01:01:47.809 --> 01:01:50.175
Looks like some sort of breeding pen.

01:01:51.179 --> 01:01:53.647
They say people used to
breed animals, fish, anything.

01:01:55.216 --> 01:01:56.581
To eat, you know?

01:01:57.285 --> 01:01:59.550
Must have been a savage world.

01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:20.730
He said go down.

01:06:24.349 --> 01:06:26.214
Maybe we can put these around us.

01:06:26.418 --> 01:06:29.410
Let's take our clothes off
first, before they freeze on us.

01:06:58.216 --> 01:06:59.410
Welcome, humans.

01:07:00.819 --> 01:07:03.117
I am ready for you.

01:07:03.721 --> 01:07:05.916
Fish, plankton...

01:07:06.123 --> 01:07:09.251
...sea greens and protein from the sea.

01:07:10.260 --> 01:07:12.057
Fresh as harvest day.

01:07:14.365 --> 01:07:17.357
Overwhelming, am I not?

01:07:17.568 --> 01:07:19.559
Are you, too, startled?

01:07:19.770 --> 01:07:22.933
Am I too removed from your ken?

01:07:23.140 --> 01:07:24.402
What...?

01:07:24.975 --> 01:07:26.100
Who are you?

01:07:26.576 --> 01:07:28.670
I'm more than machine...

01:07:28.879 --> 01:07:30.312
...or man.

01:07:30.514 --> 01:07:33.608
More than a fusion of the two.

01:07:34.151 --> 01:07:35.812
Don't you agree?

01:07:38.589 --> 01:07:41.456
Wait for the winds.

01:07:41.658 --> 01:07:44.354
Then, my birds...

01:07:44.561 --> 01:07:45.858
...sing...

01:07:46.063 --> 01:07:49.828
...and the deep
grottoes whisper my name.

01:07:50.833 --> 01:07:52.266
Box!

01:07:52.702 --> 01:07:54.294
Box!

01:07:54.504 --> 01:07:56.665
Box!

01:07:58.674 --> 01:08:01.405
This place is a link
to Sanctuary, isn't it?

01:08:01.745 --> 01:08:03.235
Link?

01:08:04.148 --> 01:08:05.513
How do you think we got here?

01:08:06.116 --> 01:08:07.743
Same as the others.

01:08:07.951 --> 01:08:09.179
Don't you remember?

01:08:09.386 --> 01:08:11.012
Why do you think we're here?

01:08:11.587 --> 01:08:12.986
Why?

01:08:13.189 --> 01:08:14.156
Why?

01:08:15.591 --> 01:08:18.685
We were sent here. And you know it.

01:08:18.895 --> 01:08:22.160
You say others have been
sent here. Where are they?

01:08:23.066 --> 01:08:23.930
In hiding?

01:08:24.667 --> 01:08:26.191
Hiding?

01:08:26.402 --> 01:08:28.461
Yes.

01:08:28.770 --> 01:08:30.033
Hiding.

01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:32.569
You know about Sanctuary.

01:08:32.774 --> 01:08:33.867
I know you do.

01:08:34.077 --> 01:08:36.636
- Sanctuary?
- You have to help us.

01:08:37.180 --> 01:08:40.240
You don't have a choice!
It's not your decision!

01:08:40.450 --> 01:08:41.712
So tell us!

01:08:42.051 --> 01:08:43.075
Very well.

01:08:43.286 --> 01:08:44.912
Follow me.

01:08:51.426 --> 01:08:53.054
This way.

01:09:09.946 --> 01:09:11.106
How'd they get there?

01:09:11.314 --> 01:09:13.111
Regular storage procedure.

01:09:13.316 --> 01:09:15.113
The same as the other food.

01:09:15.318 --> 01:09:18.809
The other food stopped
coming, and they started.

01:09:20.154 --> 01:09:21.679
What other food?

01:09:22.224 --> 01:09:25.990
Fish and plankton and sea greens...

01:09:26.194 --> 01:09:28.094
...and protein from the sea.

01:09:28.296 --> 01:09:29.627
It's all here.

01:09:29.930 --> 01:09:30.898
Ready.

01:09:31.099 --> 01:09:33.465
Fresh as harvest day.

01:09:33.667 --> 01:09:36.000
Fish and plankton.

01:09:36.203 --> 01:09:39.265
Sea greens and protein from the sea.

01:09:39.475 --> 01:09:41.533
And then it stopped coming...

01:09:41.743 --> 01:09:43.540
...and they came instead.

01:09:43.745 --> 01:09:46.042
So I store them here.

01:09:46.615 --> 01:09:48.242
I'm ready...

01:09:48.450 --> 01:09:50.008
...and you're ready.

01:09:51.819 --> 01:09:53.287
It's my job...

01:09:53.889 --> 01:09:55.049
...to freeze you!

01:09:55.257 --> 01:09:56.747
Protein...

01:09:57.425 --> 01:10:00.360
...plankton, grass from the sea!

01:10:16.444 --> 01:10:17.706
My birds!

01:10:18.113 --> 01:10:19.580
My birds!

01:11:08.629 --> 01:11:09.960
What is it?

01:11:11.297 --> 01:11:12.696
I don't know.

01:11:15.001 --> 01:11:16.628
Whatever it is...

01:11:16.836 --> 01:11:18.202
...it's warm.

01:11:24.078 --> 01:11:26.137
We must be outside.

01:12:56.335 --> 01:12:58.668
I didn't know any place
could be like this.

01:13:00.606 --> 01:13:02.335
Everything hurts.

01:13:10.315 --> 01:13:11.680
I hate outside!

01:13:11.883 --> 01:13:14.283
- I hate it! I hate it!
- Jessica!

01:13:14.486 --> 01:13:17.580
It's all right. Come on, it's all right!

01:13:18.357 --> 01:13:20.291
We'll be all right. Don't worry.

01:13:21.893 --> 01:13:23.292
We'll get there.

01:13:25.130 --> 01:13:26.892
Just got to find some water.

01:13:39.244 --> 01:13:40.643
It's dark...

01:13:40.846 --> 01:13:42.279
...and cold.

01:13:43.081 --> 01:13:44.810
And I'm tired.

01:13:45.083 --> 01:13:47.347
Come on. We must get out of here.

01:13:47.552 --> 01:13:48.746
Sorry.

01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:51.515
I can't go any further.

01:13:56.060 --> 01:13:57.925
Let's rest in here.

01:14:17.348 --> 01:14:19.748
Do you think everything
will turn to ice?

01:14:20.885 --> 01:14:22.318
I doubt it.

01:14:26.223 --> 01:14:27.918
Don't ever let go.

01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:31.257
I won't.

01:14:37.234 --> 01:14:39.327
It all seemed to make sense...

01:14:40.004 --> 01:14:41.631
...until Box.

01:14:43.641 --> 01:14:45.609
You think he was telling the truth?

01:14:46.410 --> 01:14:48.105
What truth?

01:14:49.814 --> 01:14:52.374
Perhaps we're the first
people to get through.

01:14:54.919 --> 01:14:57.751
Maybe Sanctuary isn't far now.

01:14:59.522 --> 01:15:01.581
Another protected place.

01:15:02.692 --> 01:15:04.421
Can't be outside.

01:15:04.627 --> 01:15:06.322
Who would ever know?

01:15:07.197 --> 01:15:09.132
And even if we find it...

01:15:09.633 --> 01:15:11.567
...we can't go back now.

01:15:17.608 --> 01:15:20.075
No, you're right.

01:15:20.276 --> 01:15:21.937
It must be near now.

01:15:23.847 --> 01:15:25.280
We'll find it.

01:15:30.220 --> 01:15:31.187
Look!

01:15:31.387 --> 01:15:32.718
Logan, look!

01:15:32.922 --> 01:15:33.820
Water!

01:16:18.468 --> 01:16:19.628
Look.

01:16:20.203 --> 01:16:22.000
Look at your palm.

01:16:22.839 --> 01:16:23.806
The crystal.

01:16:24.007 --> 01:16:25.531
It's clear.

01:16:26.042 --> 01:16:27.633
What does it mean?

01:16:29.144 --> 01:16:32.011
The life clocks have no power outside.

01:16:33.248 --> 01:16:34.738
We're free!

01:16:42.591 --> 01:16:43.990
You can have...

01:16:44.192 --> 01:16:46.057
...any woman in the city.

01:16:46.628 --> 01:16:48.392
What do you really want?

01:16:48.998 --> 01:16:50.328
You know.

01:16:52.801 --> 01:16:54.735
The choice is still mine?

01:16:56.505 --> 01:16:57.870
Of course.

01:17:00.375 --> 01:17:01.740
This time...

01:17:02.678 --> 01:17:04.441
...the answer's yes.

01:17:35.910 --> 01:17:37.810
It must be Sanctuary!

01:17:38.012 --> 01:17:39.479
Outside?

01:17:39.947 --> 01:17:41.414
Exposed?

01:17:42.683 --> 01:17:44.241
But it must be.

01:17:45.419 --> 01:17:47.785
Whatever it is, there
are probably people there.

01:17:47.989 --> 01:17:49.547
And food and shelter.

01:17:49.790 --> 01:17:51.257
Come on.

01:18:48.515 --> 01:18:50.745
What do you suppose
happened to the people?

01:18:52.252 --> 01:18:54.914
I don't know. They must have left here.

01:18:55.388 --> 01:18:57.083
A long time ago.

01:18:58.459 --> 01:19:00.290
I wonder what they were like.

01:19:28.420 --> 01:19:30.217
That must be one of them.

01:19:31.123 --> 01:19:33.251
Then they looked almost like us.

01:19:34.327 --> 01:19:35.419
Except...

01:19:36.463 --> 01:19:38.954
...I've never seen a
face like that before.

01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:41.332
That must be...

01:19:43.703 --> 01:19:45.466
...the look of being old.

01:20:23.909 --> 01:20:26.776
They've all got names
and numbers on them.

01:20:28.113 --> 01:20:29.808
I wonder what they are?

01:20:30.616 --> 01:20:33.141
"Beloved husband. " "Beloved wife. "

01:20:33.585 --> 01:20:35.518
I wonder what it means.

01:23:15.711 --> 01:23:16.700
Who are you?

01:23:19.348 --> 01:23:21.043
Who are you?

01:23:24.521 --> 01:23:26.352
I'm Logan 5.

01:23:28.058 --> 01:23:30.083
This is Jessica 6.

01:23:31.728 --> 01:23:35.686
I never much cared for my name,
even when I could remember it.

01:23:37.866 --> 01:23:39.458
We're from the city.

01:23:44.340 --> 01:23:46.808
Yes, we came through the ice.

01:23:48.110 --> 01:23:49.873
We got past Box.

01:23:50.779 --> 01:23:52.007
Box?

01:23:53.949 --> 01:23:56.851
This is Sanctuary, isn't it?

01:23:59.822 --> 01:24:01.449
Sanctuary?

01:24:06.195 --> 01:24:08.356
May I see your hand?

01:24:24.312 --> 01:24:25.802
Look at his face.

01:24:26.014 --> 01:24:27.539
His hair.

01:24:28.817 --> 01:24:32.514
- Is that what it is to grow old?
- I guess so, yes.

01:24:32.788 --> 01:24:34.779
But how old are you?

01:24:34.990 --> 01:24:37.185
I don't know. I'm as old...

01:24:37.393 --> 01:24:39.588
...as I am, I suppose.

01:24:41.397 --> 01:24:43.455
Your hair is white.

01:24:43.664 --> 01:24:46.132
Yes, well, it wasn't
always that color, you know.

01:24:46.334 --> 01:24:48.894
I got my color someplace here.

01:24:49.103 --> 01:24:52.766
It wasn't your color. It
wasn't much like hers, either.

01:24:54.208 --> 01:24:56.472
Those cracks in your face...

01:24:56.677 --> 01:24:57.666
...do they hurt?

01:25:01.650 --> 01:25:03.083
Can I touch them?

01:25:03.619 --> 01:25:05.018
Oh, my.

01:25:05.353 --> 01:25:06.547
Try.

01:25:25.039 --> 01:25:26.370
Are you alone here?

01:25:27.442 --> 01:25:29.204
Hardly.

01:25:33.881 --> 01:25:36.008
I got all these cats.

01:25:39.053 --> 01:25:41.886
Is that what they're called? Cats?

01:25:42.156 --> 01:25:43.987
And they've each got their own name.

01:25:44.192 --> 01:25:47.025
Cats, of course, what
else would they be called?

01:25:47.395 --> 01:25:48.487
Cats!

01:25:50.131 --> 01:25:52.121
You know they've each got three names?

01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:56.166
The naming of cats
is a difficult matter.

01:25:56.369 --> 01:25:59.167
It's not just one of your holiday games.

01:25:59.372 --> 01:26:01.237
You may think at first
I'm mad as a hatter...

01:26:01.441 --> 01:26:05.969
...when I tell you that each
cat's got three different names.

01:26:06.614 --> 01:26:08.241
See, they got their ordinary name...

01:26:08.583 --> 01:26:11.450
...and then they got their fancy name.

01:26:12.153 --> 01:26:14.382
And that makes two names, doesn't it?

01:26:15.088 --> 01:26:16.487
Now it's got a third name.

01:26:16.690 --> 01:26:19.989
Can either of you two guess
what that third name is?

01:26:21.128 --> 01:26:22.652
Come on!

01:26:27.300 --> 01:26:29.234
Above and beyond...

01:26:29.436 --> 01:26:31.131
...there's one name that's left over...

01:26:31.338 --> 01:26:34.637
...and this is the name
you never will guess.

01:26:34.941 --> 01:26:38.671
The name no human
research can discover...

01:26:38.878 --> 01:26:41.177
...but the cat itself knows...

01:26:41.381 --> 01:26:42.939
...and never will confess.

01:26:43.150 --> 01:26:44.674
Will you, Henry?

01:26:47.187 --> 01:26:48.916
How long have you been living here?

01:26:50.023 --> 01:26:52.423
A little longer than I can remember.

01:26:54.694 --> 01:26:56.662
What kind of a place is this?

01:26:58.097 --> 01:26:59.325
Well, it's...

01:26:59.532 --> 01:27:01.864
...just a place, you know. Just a place.

01:27:03.802 --> 01:27:04.734
How'd you get here?

01:27:05.971 --> 01:27:07.962
I've always been here. Hello, Thomas.

01:27:09.108 --> 01:27:10.405
Are there other people?

01:27:11.544 --> 01:27:12.978
Oh, gracious, no.

01:27:13.180 --> 01:27:15.774
Has anyone else ever
passed through here?

01:27:15.982 --> 01:27:19.179
There may be a few out
there. I don't know.

01:27:20.486 --> 01:27:21.817
What makes you think that?

01:27:22.955 --> 01:27:24.582
My parents told me.

01:27:24.790 --> 01:27:26.121
My mother...

01:27:31.297 --> 01:27:32.423
...and my father.

01:27:33.399 --> 01:27:35.560
You knew your mother and father?

01:27:35.968 --> 01:27:37.902
Sure, they raised me.

01:27:40.406 --> 01:27:41.930
How were you grown?

01:27:42.908 --> 01:27:44.101
Inside your mother?

01:27:44.877 --> 01:27:46.310
Right in there.

01:27:47.046 --> 01:27:48.240
Are you sure?

01:27:48.681 --> 01:27:50.808
That's what she told me.

01:27:51.016 --> 01:27:53.780
I have to believe her. I don't know.

01:27:54.853 --> 01:27:55.842
Where are they?

01:27:56.222 --> 01:27:57.086
What was that?

01:27:57.656 --> 01:27:58.953
Where are they now?

01:27:59.191 --> 01:28:00.351
Where?

01:28:00.559 --> 01:28:02.049
They're dead.

01:28:02.728 --> 01:28:04.559
They are dead. Yeah.

01:28:04.763 --> 01:28:05.990
Buried.

01:28:07.198 --> 01:28:08.130
Buried?

01:28:09.467 --> 01:28:10.798
They're buried.

01:28:18.410 --> 01:28:20.207
Gus was the cat at the theater door.

01:28:20.412 --> 01:28:24.815
His name, and I should have told
you before, is really Asparagus.

01:28:25.017 --> 01:28:27.008
But that's such a fuss to pronounce.

01:28:27.219 --> 01:28:30.346
...we call him just Gus.

01:28:33.258 --> 01:28:36.318
Why did you want to see my hand before?

01:28:37.762 --> 01:28:39.525
You'd better show me yours.

01:28:40.632 --> 01:28:42.224
Yes, you had.

01:28:46.137 --> 01:28:47.604
That's lovely.

01:28:47.805 --> 01:28:49.329
That's beautiful.

01:28:50.908 --> 01:28:52.569
Can I have one of these?

01:28:56.014 --> 01:28:58.676
I'm sorry. It's not possible.

01:29:00.518 --> 01:29:02.577
That's just not fair.

01:29:03.054 --> 01:29:04.112
Hello.

01:29:05.156 --> 01:29:07.920
I'll give you one of my
best cats, my favorite.

01:29:08.393 --> 01:29:10.361
I'll give you a Jellicle cat. I will.

01:29:11.562 --> 01:29:14.894
I'm sorry, I really don't
have anything to give you.

01:29:15.332 --> 01:29:17.061
That's the truth.

01:29:17.934 --> 01:29:19.128
You hear that?

01:29:19.336 --> 01:29:21.998
Here, you can have this.

01:29:23.541 --> 01:29:25.441
What is that treasure?

01:29:25.643 --> 01:29:27.235
I don't know.

01:29:29.647 --> 01:29:32.707
You don't know. You're
full of secrets as Macavity.

01:29:33.084 --> 01:29:36.052
Macavity, Macavity. There's
no one like Macavity.

01:29:36.253 --> 01:29:40.417
There never was a cat of such
deceitfulness and suavity.

01:29:43.126 --> 01:29:45.754
What lies beyond this
place? Do you know?

01:29:45.996 --> 01:29:47.429
Welleverity.

01:29:48.932 --> 01:29:52.368
I don't know, nothing. Nothing there.

01:29:52.569 --> 01:29:55.868
Did your father or mother
ever mention another place?

01:29:56.406 --> 01:29:59.204
My mother? No, she never
mentioned any other.

01:29:59.409 --> 01:30:01.001
Nothing at all.

01:30:05.182 --> 01:30:07.047
May we stay here?

01:30:07.818 --> 01:30:09.445
We'd like to rest awhile.

01:30:09.886 --> 01:30:11.911
Of course. This belongs to the people.

01:30:14.958 --> 01:30:18.325
- What belongs to the people?
- Certainly does. All of it.

01:30:21.097 --> 01:30:22.291
What people?

01:30:22.465 --> 01:30:25.025
All of them. It's marked
on the wall someplace.

01:30:25.234 --> 01:30:26.667
All the people, all the time...

01:30:26.869 --> 01:30:28.336
...shall not...

01:30:30.140 --> 01:30:31.664
I'll be right back.

01:30:35.846 --> 01:30:38.144
That sweet madman.

01:30:39.282 --> 01:30:41.546
How could he come to exist?

01:30:42.419 --> 01:30:44.716
He had a mother and a father.

01:30:45.020 --> 01:30:48.046
And they spent their lives together.

01:30:50.025 --> 01:30:52.152
One in a million, I suppose.

01:30:52.728 --> 01:30:54.127
Who knows?

01:31:00.336 --> 01:31:02.396
We are going on, aren't we?

01:31:04.408 --> 01:31:06.034
There's nothing to go on to.

01:31:07.143 --> 01:31:08.770
There's Sanctuary.

01:31:08.978 --> 01:31:09.967
There is.

01:31:11.180 --> 01:31:12.613
You want there to be one, but-

01:31:12.815 --> 01:31:14.373
There has to be!

01:31:14.750 --> 01:31:16.081
I know it exists.

01:31:16.285 --> 01:31:19.311
- It has to.
- No, it does not. Not really.

01:31:19.989 --> 01:31:23.686
Just so many people want it to exist,
so many people who don't want to die...

01:31:23.893 --> 01:31:27.829
...they want it so much that a
place called Sanctuary becomes real.

01:31:28.030 --> 01:31:31.556
But it doesn't exist. It never existed.

01:31:32.867 --> 01:31:33.856
Just the hope.

01:31:34.068 --> 01:31:35.366
You're wrong!

01:31:35.571 --> 01:31:38.131
- It has to be! It has to be!
- Oh, Jessica.

01:31:41.811 --> 01:31:43.039
Oh, my.

01:31:43.245 --> 01:31:45.076
Don't cry.

01:31:47.883 --> 01:31:51.875
Look, I got some bigger ones of these
over there. I don't know who they all are.

01:31:52.086 --> 01:31:54.384
I think they must be family.

01:31:54.589 --> 01:31:56.386
That'll cheer you up.

01:31:56.591 --> 01:31:59.082
That's my color. That's what it is.

01:31:59.294 --> 01:32:01.387
Leave her alone.

01:32:16.578 --> 01:32:18.773
Surprised you, Doris, didn't he?

01:32:19.414 --> 01:32:21.575
Now, I don't know who these all are.

01:32:21.783 --> 01:32:24.650
I'm quite used to them. They
all look the same to me now.

01:32:24.853 --> 01:32:28.584
When I first found them,
they were a little different.

01:32:32.427 --> 01:32:35.021
You know, feel free to look at them.

01:32:35.230 --> 01:32:38.198
But they're all old men.

01:32:39.466 --> 01:32:42.868
Father said that one of these people...

01:32:43.071 --> 01:32:45.835
...never told a lie. I
don't know which one it is.

01:32:50.078 --> 01:32:52.342
You thought I wouldn't
find you, didn't you?

01:32:52.814 --> 01:32:54.839
You thought I'd quit, huh?

01:32:55.950 --> 01:32:57.645
What did you do to him?

01:32:58.585 --> 01:33:01.383
You know what he was? He was a Sandman.

01:33:01.588 --> 01:33:03.180
He was happy.

01:33:03.790 --> 01:33:06.725
You ruined him. You killed him.

01:33:08.929 --> 01:33:10.191
Wait.

01:33:10.998 --> 01:33:13.489
I've seen this face before.

01:33:14.936 --> 01:33:16.062
Yes, isn't he the...

01:33:42.729 --> 01:33:44.093
Logan!

01:33:55.642 --> 01:33:56.506
Why, Logan?

01:33:57.544 --> 01:33:58.636
Why?

01:33:59.713 --> 01:34:02.079
Is this good? Is this what you want?

01:34:05.852 --> 01:34:07.682
We had good times.

01:34:09.555 --> 01:34:10.522
I let you go.

01:34:11.457 --> 01:34:13.049
You wouldn't terminate a runner...

01:34:13.259 --> 01:34:15.159
...and I covered for you!

01:34:16.162 --> 01:34:17.823
Why did you let her?

01:34:18.731 --> 01:34:20.893
And now, I have to finish you.

01:34:22.436 --> 01:34:24.836
You are terminated, runner.

01:34:25.405 --> 01:34:27.464
Francis, look at your palm.

01:34:27.841 --> 01:34:29.740
Go on. Look at it.

01:34:31.010 --> 01:34:32.637
Go on, look at it!

01:34:37.283 --> 01:34:39.342
Believe me, it's true.

01:34:40.019 --> 01:34:41.611
This isn't the truth.

01:34:41.821 --> 01:34:43.516
This is a lie!

01:35:01.941 --> 01:35:04.034
Francis, stop! Listen!

01:36:51.281 --> 01:36:53.647
That was the right shot.

01:36:55.385 --> 01:36:57.216
Watch out, now.

01:36:57.855 --> 01:36:59.447
He's tricky.

01:37:00.858 --> 01:37:02.416
He'll fool you.

01:37:17.141 --> 01:37:18.699
You renewed.

01:38:03.152 --> 01:38:05.313
I don't want to say anymore...

01:38:05.521 --> 01:38:09.150
...but I hope that is
understood, young woman.

01:38:09.358 --> 01:38:10.792
Of course.

01:38:11.261 --> 01:38:13.559
Now don't forget...

01:38:13.897 --> 01:38:15.830
...you promised.

01:38:16.032 --> 01:38:17.090
We'll remember.

01:38:17.300 --> 01:38:19.461
But that's a long time off.

01:38:20.069 --> 01:38:21.730
I wish I knew, but...

01:38:21.938 --> 01:38:23.735
Long time off.

01:38:29.545 --> 01:38:31.172
What are we promising him?

01:38:32.114 --> 01:38:36.073
He asked if we would bury
him when his time comes.

01:38:36.751 --> 01:38:38.184
We can't.

01:38:41.489 --> 01:38:43.048
We're going back.

01:38:43.259 --> 01:38:44.556
Back?

01:38:44.827 --> 01:38:46.260
To what?

01:38:46.462 --> 01:38:48.191
I have to tell them the truth.

01:38:48.397 --> 01:38:51.594
You won't be able to
tell anybody anything.

01:38:51.801 --> 01:38:53.291
You'll be killed.

01:38:53.502 --> 01:38:55.129
Not when they've learned of this.

01:38:55.338 --> 01:38:56.703
They won't listen.

01:38:56.906 --> 01:38:58.965
Things don't change.

01:39:00.275 --> 01:39:03.369
We can stay here together.

01:39:03.578 --> 01:39:05.671
Have a life as long as his together.

01:39:05.881 --> 01:39:08.315
Jessica, things do change. Look.

01:39:08.516 --> 01:39:11.041
You're lying. You don't
want to change anything.

01:39:11.253 --> 01:39:12.880
You want to go back to kill!

01:39:13.088 --> 01:39:14.715
- Listen to me.
- Francis was right!

01:39:14.923 --> 01:39:18.189
- You really- -
Look. Listen to me.

01:39:19.629 --> 01:39:22.426
The life clocks made me kill Francis.

01:39:22.831 --> 01:39:25.664
They kill people every single day.

01:39:26.368 --> 01:39:29.769
If I don't go back
and try to stop that...

01:39:29.971 --> 01:39:32.064
...destroy them...

01:39:32.274 --> 01:39:34.037
...I can't live here.

01:39:34.242 --> 01:39:36.039
I couldn't live anywhere.

01:39:37.012 --> 01:39:39.242
Don't you understand that?

01:39:39.447 --> 01:39:40.914
All I want...

01:39:41.116 --> 01:39:44.017
...is to be alive and with you.

01:39:44.218 --> 01:39:45.845
That's all.

01:39:46.921 --> 01:39:49.584
Do you think I want
anything different now?

01:39:59.567 --> 01:40:01.467
Must we leave soon?

01:40:03.071 --> 01:40:05.005
As soon as it gets light.

01:40:16.684 --> 01:40:19.983
We're going to have to
leave you in the morning.

01:40:23.258 --> 01:40:26.022
What kind of people are you?

01:40:26.594 --> 01:40:30.188
She promised you'd stay
here and bury me! You did!

01:40:30.397 --> 01:40:31.955
Come with us.

01:40:34.068 --> 01:40:36.263
Yes. Come with us.

01:40:36.470 --> 01:40:38.131
Yes, you must.

01:40:38.339 --> 01:40:39.567
We need you now.

01:40:39.773 --> 01:40:43.209
If people see you, then
they must believe us.

01:40:44.745 --> 01:40:46.440
Where you going?

01:40:47.114 --> 01:40:51.346
We're going to a city with
thousands and thousands of people.

01:40:51.552 --> 01:40:52.711
Young people.

01:40:52.919 --> 01:40:55.445
All the people, all the time.

01:40:55.656 --> 01:40:56.918
Five million.

01:40:57.124 --> 01:40:58.682
How many...?

01:40:59.827 --> 01:41:01.294
Is that more than my cats?

01:41:01.495 --> 01:41:02.723
More.

01:41:02.930 --> 01:41:04.124
Much, much more.

01:41:04.331 --> 01:41:08.028
More than...? Oh, my!
And all of them alive!

01:41:11.338 --> 01:41:13.568
Is it a long journey?

01:41:14.241 --> 01:41:15.832
It's a journey.

01:41:20.079 --> 01:41:22.775
We lived in most of these houses.

01:41:22.982 --> 01:41:25.280
But they became too small for us...

01:41:25.485 --> 01:41:28.182
...and ran out of mice,
I guess. I don't know.

01:41:31.358 --> 01:41:33.622
I used to come fishing here...

01:41:33.827 --> 01:41:36.954
...but somehow all the fish
died. Long time ago, now.

01:41:37.163 --> 01:41:39.723
Nothing sadder than a dead fish.

01:41:40.033 --> 01:41:44.026
All young people, you say?
I don't even remember what...

01:41:44.237 --> 01:41:47.001
Although, of course,
the young people, yeah...

01:41:49.475 --> 01:41:51.966
They say this thing
used to be called a road.

01:41:52.178 --> 01:41:54.806
Had to give bits of metal to use it.

01:41:56.916 --> 01:41:58.213
How far away is it?

01:41:59.252 --> 01:42:01.379
It's much further than it looks.

01:42:01.587 --> 01:42:02.485
It's big.

01:42:02.688 --> 01:42:05.248
It's cold. Let's go back to the fire.

01:42:06.459 --> 01:42:08.757
- We'll be there soon.
- Soon?

01:42:12.565 --> 01:42:15.295
That's worth its weight in gold.

01:42:15.735 --> 01:42:18.568
That is, when it's cold.

01:42:22.941 --> 01:42:25.739
You know, I've been thinking.

01:42:25.944 --> 01:42:27.935
Those words we saw...

01:42:28.146 --> 01:42:31.582
..."Beloved husband. " "Beloved wife. "

01:42:32.551 --> 01:42:33.519
What do they mean?

01:42:33.719 --> 01:42:35.482
Oh, well, you see...

01:42:35.788 --> 01:42:38.780
..."Beloved wife" would
mean my mother, see?

01:42:38.991 --> 01:42:41.653
And "Beloved husband"
would be more like...

01:42:43.129 --> 01:42:44.426
...my father.

01:42:45.163 --> 01:42:49.623
- They use those words to stay together.
- Stay together?

01:42:49.835 --> 01:42:52.167
- I can't put it any different.
- But you mean...

01:42:52.604 --> 01:42:56.062
I mean, they lived
together all their years?

01:42:58.210 --> 01:42:59.871
Before I come along, I don't know.

01:43:00.078 --> 01:43:02.512
But after, yeah, they did.

01:43:03.782 --> 01:43:07.809
So people stayed together
for this feeling of love?

01:43:08.019 --> 01:43:11.147
They would live and raise children...

01:43:11.356 --> 01:43:12.653
...and be remembered?

01:43:13.825 --> 01:43:16.885
They raised me, didn't
they? Right in there.

01:43:19.598 --> 01:43:21.566
I think I'd like that.

01:43:21.766 --> 01:43:22.960
Don't you?

01:43:26.705 --> 01:43:27.603
Why not?

01:43:29.673 --> 01:43:31.265
Beloved husband.

01:43:36.814 --> 01:43:37.906
Beloved wife.

01:43:38.115 --> 01:43:39.708
Beloved son.

01:43:41.820 --> 01:43:43.048
Here we go.

01:43:47.192 --> 01:43:48.523
That's right.

01:43:53.097 --> 01:43:56.589
You mean to say those people know
ahead of time when they'll die?

01:43:57.334 --> 01:43:58.665
- That's right.
- That's silly.

01:43:58.869 --> 01:44:00.894
What's the reason for that?

01:44:01.305 --> 01:44:04.035
That's the way things are.
The way they've always been.

01:44:04.241 --> 01:44:06.141
It takes all the fun out of dying.

01:44:06.343 --> 01:44:08.538
But if they're all shut
up tight in there...

01:44:08.746 --> 01:44:10.805
...how we going to get to see them?

01:44:11.015 --> 01:44:13.075
All the young people?

01:44:13.285 --> 01:44:14.445
What'd you say?

01:44:22.126 --> 01:44:23.650
What does the water do?

01:44:23.861 --> 01:44:25.795
Must be part of the power system.

01:44:26.130 --> 01:44:28.963
The ocean tides are
turned into energy somehow.

01:44:29.733 --> 01:44:32.463
- Does it go inside the city?
- Yes, I think so.

01:44:32.670 --> 01:44:34.160
I don't know where, though.

01:44:34.405 --> 01:44:37.169
Just took it for granted,
like everything else.

01:44:37.840 --> 01:44:39.774
I think it's our only chance.

01:44:50.621 --> 01:44:51.883
Here, let me help you!

01:44:52.089 --> 01:44:55.149
No, I can look after myself.

01:44:55.359 --> 01:44:57.384
If ever a time comes...

01:44:57.828 --> 01:45:00.955
...when I can't look after
myself, I said to my cats...

01:45:01.164 --> 01:45:03.496
"... Why, that's the
moment that you... "

01:45:03.700 --> 01:45:05.167
Where are you?

01:45:08.404 --> 01:45:09.996
I'll have to tell him.

01:45:11.774 --> 01:45:14.538
We're going to try and
get in through here.

01:45:15.778 --> 01:45:17.211
I'm sorry...

01:45:17.413 --> 01:45:19.382
...I don't think you can make it.

01:45:19.583 --> 01:45:23.382
Oh, my. I was so looking forward
to seeing all those people.

01:45:23.586 --> 01:45:25.747
I want you to meet them too.

01:45:27.657 --> 01:45:30.626
Stay here as long as you can.

01:45:30.827 --> 01:45:32.055
We'll bring them to you.

01:45:32.262 --> 01:45:33.854
All the people?

01:45:34.964 --> 01:45:36.363
You know...

01:45:36.566 --> 01:45:38.227
...they've never seen a cat.

01:45:38.534 --> 01:45:41.162
People have never seen a cat?

01:46:00.390 --> 01:46:02.017
Oh, my.

01:48:08.649 --> 01:48:10.014
Don't go in there!

01:48:10.818 --> 01:48:12.342
You don't have to die!

01:48:12.620 --> 01:48:14.679
No one has to die at 30!

01:48:15.556 --> 01:48:17.387
You can live!

01:48:17.658 --> 01:48:18.784
Live!

01:48:20.628 --> 01:48:23.118
Live and grow old!

01:48:23.496 --> 01:48:24.895
I've seen it!

01:48:25.098 --> 01:48:26.395
She's seen it!

01:48:27.434 --> 01:48:28.731
Look!

01:48:29.402 --> 01:48:30.562
Look!

01:48:30.770 --> 01:48:32.465
Look, it's clear!

01:48:33.840 --> 01:48:35.536
Last Day...

01:48:36.043 --> 01:48:37.635
...Capricorn 29s.

01:48:37.845 --> 01:48:41.212
Year of the city 2274.

01:48:41.949 --> 01:48:44.474
Carrousel begins.

01:48:44.919 --> 01:48:47.216
No! Don't!

01:48:48.221 --> 01:48:49.085
Don't go!

01:48:50.590 --> 01:48:51.852
Listen to him!

01:48:52.459 --> 01:48:54.518
He's telling the truth!

01:48:55.495 --> 01:48:56.689
We've been outside!

01:48:57.130 --> 01:48:59.997
There's another world outside!

01:49:00.200 --> 01:49:01.326
We've seen it!

01:49:01.534 --> 01:49:03.729
The life clocks are a lie!

01:49:03.937 --> 01:49:05.734
Carrousel is a lie!

01:49:05.939 --> 01:49:08.271
There is no renewal!

01:49:09.075 --> 01:49:11.009
Nobody's going to be renewed!

01:49:11.211 --> 01:49:12.940
Believe me!

01:49:13.146 --> 01:49:14.738
Please listen!

01:49:22.222 --> 01:49:23.746
Logan 5...

01:49:24.023 --> 01:49:26.753
...did you find Sanctuary?

01:49:28.194 --> 01:49:31.094
Did you find Sanctuary?

01:49:32.898 --> 01:49:34.490
We will begin surrogation.

01:49:53.919 --> 01:49:56.080
Your surrogates are engaged.

01:50:00.792 --> 01:50:02.089
Logan 5...

01:50:02.294 --> 01:50:05.991
...you were assigned to find
a place called Sanctuary.

01:50:06.198 --> 01:50:07.688
Report.

01:50:10.168 --> 01:50:15.106
There is no Sanctuary.

01:50:16.108 --> 01:50:19.703
Unacceptable. The
answer does not program.

01:50:21.079 --> 01:50:22.603
You were assigned to locate...

01:50:22.814 --> 01:50:24.611
...missing runners.

01:50:25.050 --> 01:50:27.177
State what you found.

01:50:28.053 --> 01:50:31.250
All frozen.

01:50:32.758 --> 01:50:36.216
The input does not program, Logan 5.

01:50:36.428 --> 01:50:38.088
You may not resist.

01:50:38.296 --> 01:50:40.662
An old...

01:50:42.099 --> 01:50:43.361
...man.

01:50:44.769 --> 01:50:47.034
You must not resist, Logan 5.

01:50:47.739 --> 01:50:50.173
Did you find Sanctuary?

01:50:50.576 --> 01:50:54.012
There is no Sanctuary.

01:50:54.212 --> 01:50:57.477
An old man.

01:51:01.485 --> 01:51:04.977
You broke city seals and went outside.

01:51:05.189 --> 01:51:06.486
Confirm outside.

01:51:06.657 --> 01:51:09.990
Old ruins...

01:51:10.161 --> 01:51:11.822
...exposed.

01:51:18.336 --> 01:51:21.636
There is no...

01:51:22.007 --> 01:51:24.497
...Sanctuary.

01:51:24.709 --> 01:51:26.006
Answer the question.

01:51:29.814 --> 01:51:31.076
Input contrary!

01:51:31.282 --> 01:51:33.182
Input contrary!

01:51:35.620 --> 01:51:37.019
You may not resist!

01:51:37.221 --> 01:51:38.449
You may not resist!

01:51:40.591 --> 01:51:43.389
Unacceptable!
Unacceptable! Unacceptable!

01:52:41.818 --> 01:52:42.477
Watch it!
