00:12.011 --> 00:13.471
Previously on Dynasty:

00:13.555 --> 00:16.306
Dad always made me believe
my mom was the bad one.

00:16.391 --> 00:19.185
- You destroyed our family.
- I was protecting our family.

00:19.269 --> 00:22.272
When Alexis left, she wanted full custody.

00:22.355 --> 00:26.067
I just let Steven and Fallon think
that she had abandoned them.

00:26.151 --> 00:29.362
I love you, Michael.
Is that what you wanted to hear?

00:29.779 --> 00:32.741
- It was, but not like this.
- Are you in the market?

00:32.824 --> 00:35.744
- For what?
- The biggest payday of your life.

00:36.244 --> 00:37.620
Liam, my husband.

00:37.704 --> 00:40.665
Carrington Atlantic's
chairman of the board died.

00:40.749 --> 00:41.875
So did your father.

00:41.958 --> 00:43.168
As for Alexis...

00:43.251 --> 00:46.296
You never thought you'd hear this.
Wish she were here.

00:49.090 --> 00:50.175
That's my mother.

00:50.258 --> 00:53.052
Sorry I'm late. Traffic was a bitch.

01:45.563 --> 01:47.524
- Did you invite her?
- Why would I?

01:47.607 --> 01:49.609
- She's still up there.
- Doing what?

01:49.692 --> 01:52.445
Shedding more tears
than the crocodile killed to make her bag.

01:52.529 --> 01:55.657
- Did you invite her?
- Why does everyone keep asking me?

01:55.740 --> 01:58.118
Pallbearers are ready to carry the casket.

02:00.954 --> 02:02.330
Well, here you all are.

02:04.082 --> 02:07.418
I don't know if you've noticed.
This isn't a good time.

02:07.502 --> 02:11.965
No, it's a devastating time.
I am so sorry for your loss, Blake.

02:12.549 --> 02:16.010
I came to pay my respects.
Thomas was like a father to me.

02:17.095 --> 02:18.346
Hi, Mom.

02:19.055 --> 02:20.223
It's been a minute.

02:20.890 --> 02:21.724
It has.

02:23.476 --> 02:24.602
I can't believe it.

02:27.272 --> 02:30.733
Steven, you look so handsome,

02:31.901 --> 02:35.446
but you do look pale.
Have you had your vitamin D tested?

02:35.530 --> 02:39.117
Never mind therapy for abandonment issues.
How is your vitamin D?

02:39.200 --> 02:44.038
Fallon, I'm glad to see that your father
had your teeth fixed, if not your tongue.

02:44.205 --> 02:45.415
Alexis.

02:47.375 --> 02:49.335
You must be a friend of Fallon's.

02:49.419 --> 02:51.212
Actually, no.

02:51.296 --> 02:52.964
She's the new Mrs. Carrington.

02:53.423 --> 02:56.217
You'd hate her.
That's my favorite thing about her.

02:56.301 --> 03:00.555
Also, I got married, you have a year
for your secretary to send a gift.

03:00.638 --> 03:02.724
Fallon, stop engaging. We're going.

03:09.772 --> 03:10.690
Go home, Alexis.

03:15.028 --> 03:15.904
As you wish.

03:17.238 --> 03:19.782
Can you believe her?
She barely even looked at me

03:19.866 --> 03:22.911
after waltzing in
like she'd only been on a holiday.

03:23.494 --> 03:26.331
- I haven't seen her in 11 years.
- She was nervous.

03:26.414 --> 03:28.374
- She really...
- I was talking to him.

03:28.458 --> 03:30.877
Should've seen the way
she looked at Steven.

03:30.960 --> 03:34.839
Then she embarrasses him about
his complexion? She's not wrong, but...

03:35.298 --> 03:36.758
Oh, come on, Michael.

03:37.592 --> 03:40.595
I know you're mad at me,
but you can't be. Not today.

03:40.678 --> 03:43.223
He's on your payroll now. Talk to Liam.

03:45.099 --> 03:48.311
I was prepared to hate my mother-in-law,
so, no worries.

03:48.686 --> 03:52.774
I was thinking you should stay with me
until the end of our contract.

03:53.274 --> 03:55.777
You shouldn't be seen roaming around solo.

03:55.860 --> 03:59.530
- You want me to stay with you?
- Relax. We have 16 bedrooms,

04:00.114 --> 04:02.784
it'll be less crazy
than dealing with paparazzi.

04:02.867 --> 04:03.701
Will it?

04:11.084 --> 04:14.420
You could've introduced me to her.
After all, we're engaged.

04:15.588 --> 04:18.632
I didn't because I want my family
to celebrate our engagement,

04:18.716 --> 04:20.969
not forever associate it with my mother.

04:22.470 --> 04:25.265
- They think she's the devil.
- What about you?

04:25.682 --> 04:30.228
Anyone who put up with my father for that
long deserves the benefit of the doubt.

04:31.062 --> 04:33.606
Let's just hold off on telling people,
okay?

04:34.148 --> 04:35.483
Until after she's gone?

04:38.236 --> 04:40.530
She seems
like a textbook narcissist.

04:41.823 --> 04:42.782
Are you okay?

04:42.865 --> 04:47.161
Sure. My ex-wife just crashed into my life
and my current one is walking out.

04:48.037 --> 04:51.416
Blake, I didn't want to fight with you
before the funeral,

04:51.499 --> 04:55.336
but I didn't call that lawyer
because I wanted a divorce. The opposite.

04:55.420 --> 04:58.881
I called her to change the prenup
so that you keep everything.

04:59.716 --> 05:01.426
All I want to keep is you.

05:03.386 --> 05:04.887
Why the hell is she back?

05:11.728 --> 05:17.025
- Oh, all of this wasn't necessary.
- This is everything you asked for.

05:18.234 --> 05:21.362
What are you doing here?
How'd you get past the guard?

05:21.446 --> 05:24.490
You mean Frank?
I was the one who hired him, dear.

05:24.574 --> 05:25.825
We're old friends.

05:26.576 --> 05:28.494
I do hope it was a lovely service.

05:28.578 --> 05:31.331
Well, you've sure made yourself
comfortable.

05:31.414 --> 05:36.294
Yes, I've been catching up with the staff.
The place hasn't changed much, has it?

05:36.878 --> 05:40.256
- It still feels like home.
- Well, it isn't. Not yours.

05:40.798 --> 05:45.470
Anders, please see her out. The lawyers
will be here for the reading of the will.

05:45.553 --> 05:48.431
That's exactly it, Blake.
Didn't Anders tell you?

05:50.558 --> 05:52.852
- She's a beneficiary?
- I'm afraid so, sir.

05:52.935 --> 05:55.688
She didn't return my call,
so I had no idea.

05:55.772 --> 05:57.523
It was a surprise to me, too.

05:57.607 --> 06:01.903
Although Thomas did promise me
that whimsical red painting in the den.

06:02.945 --> 06:03.988
The Chagall?

06:04.072 --> 06:04.906
Unbelievable.

06:04.989 --> 06:09.243
Well, at least we know why you're back.
Let's get this over with.

06:09.952 --> 06:14.499
The reading of the last will and testament
of Thomas Fitzsimmons Carrington.

06:14.582 --> 06:18.169
As executor,
Thomas asked me to gather you all together

06:18.252 --> 06:20.963
for the distribution of his estate.

06:21.547 --> 06:24.383
As Blake knows,
his father left shares in CA to him

06:24.467 --> 06:27.929
and to the grandchildren,
to be divided into their trusts.

06:28.137 --> 06:30.932
A few items fall outside those trusts.

06:31.099 --> 06:33.434
Fallon, you'll receive
your grandmother's jewelry collection.

06:33.518 --> 06:36.145
I never understood
why you didn't receive it.

06:36.229 --> 06:37.522
She knew you'd take it.

06:37.605 --> 06:40.525
Thomas' watches and personal jewelry
go to Steven.

06:40.608 --> 06:43.236
He never had good taste,
you could melt it down.

06:43.319 --> 06:46.489
- Must you comment on everything?
- Let's get through this.

06:47.406 --> 06:48.533
Anders, continue.

06:48.616 --> 06:51.410
His art collection is bequeathed
to the High Museum

06:51.494 --> 06:54.247
with the exception of one Chagall
left to Alexis,

06:54.330 --> 06:58.042
- entitled Maternity.
- Grandpa always had a good sense of humor.

06:58.126 --> 07:00.211
He left me a generous sum of money,

07:00.294 --> 07:02.839
- and his gun collection.
- Hmm, I hope he left something

07:02.922 --> 07:06.300
for Fallon's friend.
Terrible if she didn't get anything.

07:06.634 --> 07:10.346
As for real estate, Parcels 1
through 178 are bequeathed to Blake.

07:10.972 --> 07:15.601
However, there is a codicil
that bequeaths Parcel 132 to Alexis.

07:15.685 --> 07:17.019
He left her property?

07:17.103 --> 07:19.230
- Where? New York?
- Vienna, I think?

07:19.313 --> 07:26.195
- Villa in Florence? Are you kidding me?
- No. I'm afraid... we're sitting in it.

07:27.196 --> 07:28.739
- My God!
- Carrington Estate?

07:28.823 --> 07:32.076
- He left her our home?
- All 341 acres.

07:32.160 --> 07:37.248
Oh, my God. How generous.
Looks like you can go home again.

07:42.170 --> 07:43.296
What the...?

07:52.889 --> 07:54.807
Do you think Alexis knew?

07:54.891 --> 07:57.643
Of course.
Why else show up after all these years?

07:57.727 --> 08:01.522
- She wanted to pay her respects.
- She waited until after he died?

08:01.606 --> 08:06.486
I'm with Fallon. She got to my father
somehow. He was a fool for her charms.

08:06.569 --> 08:11.157
- Yeah, or her buoyant breasts.
- She wouldn't kick you out of your home.

08:11.991 --> 08:14.535
Didn't realize
your father owned all of this.

08:14.619 --> 08:18.039
Gifted it to me, kept his name
on the deed for tax purposes.

08:18.122 --> 08:22.960
Okay, let's just say, worst-case scenario,
this thing's legit, she gets the house.

08:23.044 --> 08:27.298
You guys can move into one of your others.
To a petit château somewhere?

08:27.381 --> 08:29.926
I will die before I move to Switzerland.

08:30.009 --> 08:33.261
I'm not gonna live
in a place where nobody picks sides.

08:33.346 --> 08:35.014
It's the epitome of weak.

08:36.390 --> 08:38.183
No one is going anywhere.

08:38.851 --> 08:43.688
This is our home.
You children were born and raised here,

08:43.773 --> 08:47.485
it represents our family,
she's not going to destroy that again.

08:48.069 --> 08:50.905
My lawyers will find a way
to overturn that will.

08:50.988 --> 08:54.408
- But... That could take weeks, months.
- I've got it handled.

08:55.493 --> 08:59.205
As for you two...
let's see some wedded bliss, huh?

09:00.206 --> 09:01.249
Come on, honey.

09:06.837 --> 09:08.256
- Hi, honey.
- Sweetheart.

09:08.881 --> 09:12.093
My father meant
that my mother might sniff out this sham

09:12.176 --> 09:15.555
like the pig that she is,
find a way to use it against us.

09:15.638 --> 09:19.183
- Time for us to get acquainted.
- I'm looking forward to it.

09:19.267 --> 09:22.436
Sam can brief you.
As my assistant, he knows things...

09:22.520 --> 09:25.106
Not all things, but what married man does?

09:31.696 --> 09:32.905
What is happening?

09:32.989 --> 09:34.824
How did you get past the gate?

09:34.907 --> 09:38.703
Billy was there.
He and I have always had an understanding.

09:38.786 --> 09:39.620
I'll bet.

09:40.246 --> 09:43.082
- Which of these three is your guard dog?
- Blake.

09:43.165 --> 09:47.587
This is Mickey, my driver,
and Douglas, my tax assessor.

09:47.670 --> 09:51.340
Assessor. You realize
you can't sell a place you don't own yet.

09:51.424 --> 09:52.925
Well, I don't wanna sell.

09:53.009 --> 09:57.638
When I move in, I need to assess the
estate and the expenses that come with it.

09:57.722 --> 09:59.682
Oh, go ahead. Get started.

09:59.765 --> 10:03.352
I'm filing a restraining order
until we get that will overturned.

10:03.436 --> 10:05.229
Oh, Blake, don't be like that.

10:07.398 --> 10:09.817
Surely you can understand why he's upset.

10:09.900 --> 10:12.862
I take everything he does
with a bucket of salt.

10:13.529 --> 10:16.240
We have a tempestuous, passionate dynamic.

10:19.493 --> 10:20.494
And who is this?

10:20.661 --> 10:22.997
- He's adorable. What's his name?
- Krystle.

10:24.290 --> 10:29.337
Oh, my God, Cristal. I didn't realize
the coincidence until I said it out loud.

10:29.879 --> 10:31.922
- Can you believe it?
- No, I can't.

10:32.131 --> 10:36.093
- An interesting name for a male dog.
- The name screams out at you.

10:36.594 --> 10:39.972
He was a rescue, trashy little thing.

10:40.473 --> 10:43.726
Desperate.
Practically ate garbage out of my hand.

10:43.809 --> 10:46.937
Oh, stinky, little freeloader,
aren't you, Krystle?

10:47.688 --> 10:51.317
Yes, you are. Oh, yes, you are.

10:51.901 --> 10:52.943
Oh, yes, you are.

10:53.527 --> 10:57.782
- I do so love the opera.
- Well, then you're at the wrong venue.

10:57.865 --> 11:01.202
But we can't sit here
waiting for Lucha Libre to start.

11:01.285 --> 11:03.996
- We need to Hardy Boys the situation.
- We?

11:04.080 --> 11:07.750
Right. I meant you. While Daddy
may be taking the legal approach,

11:08.417 --> 11:10.836
if I can find leverage,
we can kick her out.

11:10.920 --> 11:13.381
When was the last
Alexis saw my grandfather?

11:13.464 --> 11:17.051
Day the codicil was drawn up?
Where's she's been, who she's with.

11:17.134 --> 11:19.553
- I'll take whatever you find.
- Why not you?

11:20.221 --> 11:23.307
It's always a very special day
in a young lady's life

11:23.391 --> 11:26.852
when she goes behind her mother's back
to find dirt.

11:27.061 --> 11:32.483
I know, it does kill me to miss out, but
Daddy doesn't want me getting any closer.

11:32.566 --> 11:35.653
Even the most powerful men
have their misconceptions.

11:35.861 --> 11:39.073
Anyway, if I can't get her out of here,
you can.

11:39.156 --> 11:42.576
- So, whatever it takes.
- Are you sure that's what you want?

11:44.036 --> 11:48.958
I don't say things I don't mean. Unless
it's "sorry." Let me know what you find.

11:55.005 --> 11:59.385
Does no one else think it's suspicious
she shows up after all these years?

11:59.468 --> 12:03.264
I'd show up, too, if my father-in-law
left me the entire estate.

12:04.598 --> 12:08.978
You don't think they were boning?
She's a lot, but she does have standards.

12:09.061 --> 12:12.022
You know, no offense, Grandpa,
rest in peace.

12:12.106 --> 12:15.943
- I don't think they were boning.
- Thank you for clearing that up.

12:16.360 --> 12:20.865
- I don't even know why you're here.
- I'm pouring my heart out. We're bonding.

12:23.826 --> 12:26.620
I'm only indulging you
because it's your mother.

12:26.704 --> 12:30.207
Instead of sending Anders
to dig up her dirt and venting to me,

12:30.291 --> 12:31.917
be a grown-up for a change.

12:32.209 --> 12:33.419
Ask her to her face.

12:42.303 --> 12:45.264
- This is Alexis Carrington.
- Hey, it's me.

12:45.764 --> 12:47.850
- Who's calling?
- It's your daughter.

12:48.058 --> 12:49.143
Bitch.

12:50.144 --> 12:54.648
Listen. It's possible
I was a bit unwelcoming, and, um...

12:56.025 --> 13:00.112
I was thinking, I do have a standing
mani-pedi appointment tomorrow.

13:00.196 --> 13:03.866
Couldn't help but notice your claws
earlier, you could use TLC.

13:06.118 --> 13:08.537
- You there?
- I was waiting for something

13:08.621 --> 13:09.747
that resembled a...

13:10.372 --> 13:13.876
- An invitation.
- Oh, well, that was it. Do you wanna come?

13:13.959 --> 13:15.753
I mean, we could catch up.

13:16.545 --> 13:18.631
I'd love that, Fallon. Thank you.

13:28.849 --> 13:30.809
So, you've been living
with Rupert?

13:30.893 --> 13:33.521
Well, sadly, he passed away last summer.

13:34.313 --> 13:37.274
Tragic.
How much did you get out of that will?

13:37.525 --> 13:40.861
You know, I've really just been on my own.
Traveling Europe.

13:40.945 --> 13:44.031
- Christmases in Acapulco.
- Murder capital of Mexico.

13:44.114 --> 13:47.034
- Well, I haven't been that recently.
- Too bad.

13:49.203 --> 13:52.206
Why don't you ask me
what you'd really like to ask me,

13:52.289 --> 13:55.751
instead of plying me with alcohol
to loosen my tongue?

13:57.419 --> 14:01.632
Oh, you know, I'm the one who taught you
that trick in eighth grade.

14:02.007 --> 14:02.841
We're good.

14:03.300 --> 14:06.929
If there's something you want to know,
I have nothing to hide.

14:07.888 --> 14:08.764
Why now?

14:09.014 --> 14:12.101
- What do you mean?
- Well, you've missed 11 birthdays,

14:12.184 --> 14:16.063
my high school, college,
and biz-school graduations,

14:16.438 --> 14:18.399
my first company, my wedding,

14:18.941 --> 14:23.112
which was complicated, whatever,
yet you come back for Grandpa's funeral?

14:23.195 --> 14:27.700
Did you know you were getting the house?
Why show up after all these years?

14:27.783 --> 14:31.620
First of all, this house means nothing
to me without family in it,

14:31.787 --> 14:34.081
and I do not want to displace anyone.

14:34.999 --> 14:38.502
- Are you delusional?
- You make it sound like I had a choice.

14:38.919 --> 14:42.006
Do you really think
that I left you behind willingly?

14:42.506 --> 14:43.340
Yes.

14:43.507 --> 14:46.135
Fallon, your father
practically banished me.

14:46.594 --> 14:47.428
And the truth?

14:48.637 --> 14:51.807
He bribed a judge
to take you out of my custody,

14:52.182 --> 14:54.435
and then paid me off to stay away.

14:54.518 --> 14:58.230
- And you took the money.
- I did because I had nothing else.

14:58.314 --> 15:00.733
But you don't know your father like I do.

15:00.816 --> 15:03.986
If I hadn't,
God only knows what he would have done.

15:04.778 --> 15:07.990
What choice did you have then?
He was a monster, right?

15:08.073 --> 15:09.033
Exactly.

15:10.117 --> 15:13.954
Raising two kids on his own
while you slept your way across Europe

15:14.038 --> 15:15.414
trying to survive.

15:15.497 --> 15:17.333
That must've been real tough...

15:18.083 --> 15:20.336
for a psychopathic liar like yourself.

15:29.053 --> 15:29.887
What the hell?

15:31.889 --> 15:33.766
She invited me, Blake.

15:35.559 --> 15:39.855
I cannot believe you. In my own home,
turning my children against me.

15:40.064 --> 15:43.317
You mean my home.
You're the one turning them against me

15:43.400 --> 15:47.363
- according to everything Fallon said.
- I have lawyers working 24/7

15:47.446 --> 15:48.864
to reverse that codicil.

15:49.698 --> 15:51.784
So, if I were you, I would just go

15:52.326 --> 15:56.288
before my guards have to drag you out
of here by your extensions.

15:56.705 --> 16:00.000
Oh, Blake,
you shouldn't get yourself so riled up.

16:00.334 --> 16:05.214
So many frown lines...
since the last time I saw you.

16:06.715 --> 16:10.511
Laugh lines.
Not that you would recognize them.

16:11.553 --> 16:13.889
No one is falling for your act, Alexis.

16:17.518 --> 16:21.730
If memory serves,
you used to fall quite hard for me.

16:23.065 --> 16:26.610
I mean, of course, we'd argue,
but we'd fall again and again,

16:26.694 --> 16:30.322
and... sometimes fall all over this desk,
do you remember?

16:32.116 --> 16:33.033
Or that chair.

16:33.826 --> 16:40.040
Didn't we conceive Fallon right there
on the rug in front of the fireplace?

16:41.000 --> 16:42.793
No, that was down by the lake.

16:44.962 --> 16:48.590
Oh, mm, after that strip croquet game.

16:48.799 --> 16:49.842
Mm.

16:50.050 --> 16:52.594
You sure knew how to swing your mallet.

16:54.346 --> 16:57.641
You remember the first time we did it
down at the stables

16:57.725 --> 17:00.811
- and dear Daddy caught us?
- And chased me with a shotgun.

17:00.894 --> 17:03.272
I never should've gone back.

17:03.355 --> 17:05.232
Oh, but you did with a ring.

17:06.316 --> 17:09.194
And then your father
bought my family's farm,

17:09.486 --> 17:11.571
and all of the land surrounding it.

17:12.406 --> 17:15.742
Then he gave it to us
for our wedding gift.

17:16.076 --> 17:17.786
Now he's willed it all to me.

17:19.413 --> 17:26.336
But, you know, Thomas never did approve...
of our getting a divorce.

17:27.963 --> 17:33.385
So, maybe it was his way
of... getting us back together.

17:33.552 --> 17:36.388
- Alexis.
- Well, it's not the craziest idea.

17:37.181 --> 17:41.477
You, me, our children.

17:42.478 --> 17:45.022
And, oh, we could make new memories.

17:46.190 --> 17:47.274
Hmm?

17:50.944 --> 17:53.906
Even if you were... to get the house,

17:54.531 --> 18:00.120
it will be as cold and empty as your heart
when you walked away from it.

18:05.209 --> 18:07.836
I made a binder
of Fallon's favorite things.

18:08.253 --> 18:11.465
I'll need to sign you up on social media
as Mr. Fallon.

18:11.632 --> 18:16.095
Actually, TheRealMrFallon, so we
don't risk dealing with impersonators.

18:16.345 --> 18:18.806
We wouldn't want someone else pretending.

18:19.264 --> 18:23.018
Look, I appreciate all the help,
but I'm good at reading people,

18:23.185 --> 18:27.272
- enough to put on a temporary show.
- Maybe this is ridiculous to you,

18:27.356 --> 18:30.651
but Fallon made this my job.
So, work with me?

18:31.151 --> 18:33.320
- Okay.
- Okay. We'll need rings, too.

18:33.612 --> 18:38.033
Something modest, yet Fallon-worthy.
Three months' salary should do it.

18:39.034 --> 18:42.246
Blake will pay. Now, based on your size...

18:43.080 --> 18:45.749
you're like a mix
in between Steven and Blake,

18:45.833 --> 18:49.711
which is, well, something
Fallon should work on in therapy,

18:49.962 --> 18:52.297
but try that on. I'll turn around.

18:55.467 --> 19:00.347
No, you're right. You should turn around
just, like... a little bit.

19:06.603 --> 19:08.438
Don't mind me. I'm reminiscing.

19:09.815 --> 19:13.569
I have more memories here
than anywhere else in the world.

19:13.777 --> 19:17.322
- Blake's chauffeur lives here now.
- This was my art studio...

19:18.782 --> 19:21.326
but I was never a really good artist,
was I?

19:21.910 --> 19:23.453
- I was never a critic.
- Mm.

19:25.038 --> 19:29.293
I always kicked myself after I left here
for not fighting for this place.

19:29.877 --> 19:34.173
This was my family's land. As a girl,
nobody taught me to look out for me.

19:34.339 --> 19:37.467
- Accounts on side, deeds in your name...
- And now look,

19:37.885 --> 19:40.888
- it's all coming back to you tenfold.
- Come on.

19:41.346 --> 19:43.849
You think
Blake's gonna let any of this go?

19:45.184 --> 19:49.396
If he can take two children from a mother,
how hard can a house be?

19:52.566 --> 19:53.650
I need your help.

19:54.693 --> 20:00.157
If I could get Fallon on my side...
I'd have a fighting chance against him.

20:00.949 --> 20:04.786
I don't know, but your daughter
is not too keen on that idea.

20:04.953 --> 20:09.166
That's because she thinks I don't care.
And I have always cared.

20:10.250 --> 20:12.628
You say she wants to know more about me.

20:15.130 --> 20:19.801
If you could give her these things, well,
maybe it would help her see the truth.

20:21.595 --> 20:24.973
I'm sorry.
We both know where my allegiance lies.

20:25.057 --> 20:28.268
Yes, I know.
You have always been here for our family,

20:28.602 --> 20:32.481
but I need you to help
get us back together...

20:34.316 --> 20:35.734
for the children's sake.

20:42.157 --> 20:45.577
Oh, Anders, you always come through.
Tell me there's something

20:45.661 --> 20:48.455
- I can use against my mother.
- I may disappoint.

20:48.538 --> 20:51.250
Nothing
that contradicts anything she told you.

20:51.333 --> 20:55.504
Few clippings. String of relationships
moved her around Europe, Paris,

20:55.587 --> 20:58.006
Prague, Kenyan safari,
Courchevel ski trips.

20:58.090 --> 21:02.219
- I get the picture. Gold Digger 101.
- Well, I couldn't comment on that.

21:02.678 --> 21:05.430
These are things I dug up
from her last time here.

21:05.514 --> 21:09.059
Stuff she gave to give to you
when you started asking about her.

21:09.142 --> 21:12.271
- But you've had this and I've never...
- You didn't ask.

21:33.500 --> 21:35.836
Hey. How are you holding up?

21:36.128 --> 21:38.755
Don't you wanna wait 11 years
to ask me that?

21:38.839 --> 21:43.051
- That's what this family does.
- Good thing you don't consider me family.

21:44.886 --> 21:49.516
Been putting up with her marvelously.
I'm impressed. Should've heard the lies

21:49.599 --> 21:53.520
she was spouting, she would've come back
but my dad banished her,

21:53.603 --> 21:58.233
that he paid off a judge to win custody.
I mean, complete insanity.

21:58.608 --> 22:00.193
- Well...
- What?

22:00.569 --> 22:03.822
- There are two sides to every story, but...
- Spit it out.

22:04.406 --> 22:09.161
It's true. I found out when I squashed
that exposé on Judge Daniels.

22:09.244 --> 22:12.164
What? Wait.
But if my dad paid off a judge,

22:12.247 --> 22:16.626
- then my mom should've had custody.
- I can't speak to that, but Blake can.

22:26.511 --> 22:29.639
Take those through here.
The wine through the kitchens.

22:30.348 --> 22:32.392
Hey. Have you seen...?

22:33.101 --> 22:34.478
- What is this?
- Tuesday.

22:34.770 --> 22:38.065
Oh, and the day we celebrate
all of the birthdays Mom missed.

22:38.148 --> 22:41.777
Evidently, something you said yesterday
got to her, and so now

22:41.860 --> 22:44.362
she's throwing 11 birthday parties
at once.

22:44.446 --> 22:49.034
- She's doing it here?
- Strong move, but at least she's trying.

22:49.493 --> 22:52.829
Maybe instead of fighting her,
we give her a chance?

22:53.580 --> 22:56.875
- I know it sounds crazy, but...
- Doesn't sound that crazy.

22:57.375 --> 22:59.878
I like presents
and Dad will lose his mind,

22:59.961 --> 23:02.714
- which is a gift all unto itself.
- What's this?

23:02.798 --> 23:05.717
Representation
of all the joy you robbed from us.

23:05.801 --> 23:09.179
- Tell me what's going on.
- Can't believe you made us think

23:09.262 --> 23:11.681
she was enemy when you rigged her exit.

23:11.765 --> 23:14.518
- Your mother.
- I don't think she meant Hillary.

23:14.726 --> 23:17.938
- You paid off Judge Daniels for custody.
- Who told you?

23:18.021 --> 23:21.149
- Mom did.
- I didn't need to pay anyone

23:21.233 --> 23:24.069
for them to see the truth.
If I'd share custody,

23:24.152 --> 23:28.782
your mother would've left the country
with you. Don't you see what she's doing?

23:29.157 --> 23:32.994
- She's pitting us against each other.
- Oh, good, you're all here.

23:33.328 --> 23:36.289
- How did you get back in? I fired Billy.
- Adorable.

23:36.498 --> 23:40.001
When are you gonna realize
I am the one who hired the staff?

23:40.585 --> 23:44.756
- I'm throwing a party for my children.
- You can just throw some glitter

23:44.840 --> 23:47.926
and all will be forgiven?
No. This ends now.

23:48.218 --> 23:52.806
What's the problem, Daddy? You want
to prove you didn't send her away before?

23:52.889 --> 23:56.810
Well, don't send her away now.
Give Mom a chance to prove herself.

23:57.102 --> 23:57.936
Fine.

24:01.273 --> 24:05.277
Go ahead. See for yourself
what kind of person she really is.

24:08.238 --> 24:09.364
Thank you, darling.

24:18.665 --> 24:21.376
- My daughter's first husband.
- Call me Liam.

24:21.543 --> 24:23.712
It's perfect running into you.

24:24.254 --> 24:27.465
Perhaps you can help me
with the menu for this evening.

24:27.591 --> 24:30.927
I'm sure that Fallon's palate has refined
over the years,

24:31.094 --> 24:33.013
but does she still like foie gras?

24:33.096 --> 24:36.766
I'm pretty sure that's not PC
to eat anymore,

24:37.100 --> 24:40.061
which is exactly why Fallon loves it.

24:40.478 --> 24:43.190
She tried to go vegan,
but who was she kidding?

24:43.273 --> 24:46.151
The things we do for love. Right?

24:48.486 --> 24:50.697
Thank you. You've been so helpful.

24:56.494 --> 24:57.996
Chapter nine, Liam.

24:58.246 --> 25:01.917
Fallon Carrington has no sympathy
for protein. Study.

25:04.961 --> 25:07.214
- Put this on.
- It's a bit much.

25:07.672 --> 25:09.841
So is this family. Congrats.

25:14.095 --> 25:17.224
Hey. Driver slash bodyguard
slash eye candy.

25:17.307 --> 25:19.601
- Name's Mickey.
- Uh-huh. Listen, Mick.

25:19.851 --> 25:23.438
Why don't you take the afternoon off?
Lift weights or drink beer.

25:23.521 --> 25:27.192
- I'll drive my mother back.
- Gotta run that past Mrs. C first.

25:27.275 --> 25:32.030
Cute. I won't bore you with sentiment,
but Mrs. C and I could use quality time.

25:32.239 --> 25:34.616
So, which hotel am I taking her to?

25:35.116 --> 25:36.076
Um...

25:36.493 --> 25:38.745
I'm not totally sure what it's called.

25:40.956 --> 25:41.790
Uh...

25:41.873 --> 25:46.461
- She mentioned Fairbank in Druid Hills.
- That's right. It's the Fairbank.

25:46.544 --> 25:50.173
Not a hotel. You're not
my mother's driver, you're her Uber.

25:50.340 --> 25:52.801
Try cleaning your windshield
once in a while.

25:53.218 --> 25:57.639
Now, I'm gonna ask you one more time.
Where has my mother been staying?

26:00.058 --> 26:02.769
The address he gave
is an hour outside Atlanta.

26:02.852 --> 26:06.106
What if I go and find
some other husband she's gold-digging

26:06.189 --> 26:08.984
or another freak show family?
Literal freaks.

26:09.067 --> 26:12.570
There's civilization beyond the city.
Not hill people there.

26:12.654 --> 26:15.573
See? You're making me feel better.
Come with me.

26:15.740 --> 26:16.992
- No.
- Culhane.

26:17.075 --> 26:22.038
I've called on you for a lot of things,
but my mother showing up suddenly

26:22.122 --> 26:26.001
and taking the house away? This
is uncharted territory. Put that down.

26:30.255 --> 26:33.550
You are my rock.
You are my bridge over troubled waters,

26:33.633 --> 26:35.969
the wind beneath my wings.
Running out of ballads,

26:37.220 --> 26:39.764
But I really need you right now, Michael.

26:47.647 --> 26:49.899
You're the only person I can count on.

26:52.444 --> 26:54.696
Let's see what your mother's been up to.

27:04.372 --> 27:06.708
You must have gotten the wrong address.

27:31.274 --> 27:35.945
I don't believe this. She told me she
spends her time traveling all over Europe.

27:36.029 --> 27:39.240
Judging from outside,
it hasn't left Georgia in months.

27:39.491 --> 27:42.327
Didn't she get a chunk of change
in the divorce?

27:42.410 --> 27:46.498
- And claims he paid her to keep her away.
- Then where's the money?

27:48.416 --> 27:52.921
There isn't. She's not here for family.
She's back because the money ran out.

27:53.338 --> 27:57.759
Check this. Looks like she got her hands
on a wedding announcement.

27:58.051 --> 28:00.178
I may or may not have done the same.

28:06.101 --> 28:07.227
Well, that's weird.

28:08.895 --> 28:09.979
How did she get...?

28:10.855 --> 28:13.983
Hey, is that her with Steven?
But that looks like...

28:14.067 --> 28:15.735
It was taken six months ago.

28:17.320 --> 28:19.030
And this is from last summer.

28:22.784 --> 28:27.205
That's why Steven's been acting so weird.
She's been in contact with him.

28:28.665 --> 28:31.084
Question is, who hasn't been lying to me?

28:38.341 --> 28:41.469
Why are we doing this?
Why are we welcoming this woman

28:41.553 --> 28:44.264
- into our house?
- We're not. It's just Alexis.

28:44.347 --> 28:47.183
She insinuates herself.
That's part of her game.

28:47.600 --> 28:49.394
Well, I'm not playing anymore.

28:50.145 --> 28:53.398
Don't you get it?
She is manipulating everyone.

28:54.149 --> 28:57.444
- Especially you.
- Me? Oh, you're being ridiculous.

28:57.527 --> 29:00.655
Am I? Why don't we give her the house
and we move out?

29:00.739 --> 29:03.950
- I am not giving her my home.
- It's four walls, Blake.

29:04.033 --> 29:07.495
- We can buy another one.
- It's 182 walls, give or take.

29:07.996 --> 29:11.666
This is my family's legacy.
You don't just walk away from that.

29:12.208 --> 29:15.295
That what you're afraid
of walking away from? Or her?

29:16.129 --> 29:20.425
- What is that supposed to mean?
- She has some kind of hold over you.

29:20.592 --> 29:24.971
You like being in war with her.
Why would you be putting up with this?

29:25.054 --> 29:29.851
Blake, was it Steven or Fallon
whose first baby food was white truffles?

29:31.060 --> 29:31.895
Both.

29:34.314 --> 29:35.398
Keep these coming.

29:37.734 --> 29:42.405
Wow. Wasn't expecting a party like this
for two grown adults.

29:42.906 --> 29:47.118
Nothing like guilt of divorced parents
with billions of dollars, right?

29:47.535 --> 29:50.288
Mom, what's with the gifts?
This is too much.

29:50.371 --> 29:54.751
Nonsense. I have missed 11 birthdays.
That's 11 presents.

29:54.834 --> 29:58.129
Not to mention Christmases.
There's a lot to make up for.

29:59.756 --> 30:02.300
Oh, I forgot a wedding gift.

30:03.218 --> 30:04.928
Though I could get you rings.

30:05.553 --> 30:10.183
- I noticed that you weren't wearing one.
- Thanks, ma'am, but we're all set.

30:10.350 --> 30:15.146
Mm. That's "miss" to you. I do find it odd
that I never noticed that before.

30:15.355 --> 30:19.234
- I do have a keen sense of jewelry.
- You do?

30:20.401 --> 30:22.487
Right, I wasn't wearing one before.

30:22.779 --> 30:24.489
It's, uh... It's my fault, really.

30:25.281 --> 30:28.743
Getting them resized
'cause they're my grandparents' rings.

30:29.869 --> 30:33.248
See, my grandfather,
he fell madly in love with a girl.

30:33.832 --> 30:37.293
But she was rich and he was poor.
Her parents forbade them.

30:37.669 --> 30:40.880
He nearly died in war
and she nearly married someone else.

30:40.964 --> 30:42.966
But they found each other 10 years later.

30:43.466 --> 30:46.469
- They died the same night, holding hands.
- Oh.

30:46.886 --> 30:48.596
Yeah. I know it sounds crazy,

30:48.680 --> 30:52.600
but... I guess that's the kind of crazy
I feel about your daughter.

30:53.101 --> 30:53.935
How sweet.

30:57.689 --> 30:59.190
That was impressive. Hey.

31:00.817 --> 31:03.570
- Was it true?
- Might've plagiarized The Notebook.

31:03.653 --> 31:06.573
Mrs. Gunnerson informed me
you're putting all this

31:06.656 --> 31:08.241
on the household account.

31:08.324 --> 31:11.327
For convenience sake.
We'll untangle it later.

31:11.995 --> 31:15.665
- And the cost of the carpet cleaning?
- Oh, Krystle.

31:16.165 --> 31:20.128
Looks like somebody needs a little walk.
What a naughty little boy.

31:20.211 --> 31:21.963
Come on. Outside we go.

31:23.381 --> 31:26.801
- Where the hell is she?
- What's the matter? Why are you so...?

31:27.927 --> 31:29.929
She's taking Krystle for a piddle.

31:30.597 --> 31:31.472
The dog, not...

31:33.182 --> 31:35.059
You lying bitch!

31:36.352 --> 31:39.022
- What in God's name?
- Steven, what happened?

31:39.105 --> 31:41.774
- We're about to find out.
- Was any of it true?

31:42.233 --> 31:45.778
- Or has it all been a lie?
- What are you talking about?

31:45.987 --> 31:50.074
Where have you been the last 10 years?
The last five? The last month?

31:50.158 --> 31:54.287
- I was all over Europe, Dubai...
- You couldn't afford to send a postcard

31:54.495 --> 31:57.582
to Dubai. I know all
about your Duck Dynasty trailer.

31:58.708 --> 32:02.003
You went there?
Well, that's just a temporary situation.

32:02.086 --> 32:04.797
- Oh, temporary insanity?
- I'm in the process

32:04.881 --> 32:08.009
of developing that land
for a summer home. Casa Morell.

32:08.092 --> 32:13.014
- The architects are doing the plans.
- What is wrong with you? Unbelievable.

32:13.097 --> 32:16.059
I caught you
and you're doubling down on more lies.

32:16.142 --> 32:19.979
How dare you call your mother a liar?
You don't even know me.

32:20.063 --> 32:23.483
How could I?
I'm not the child you stay in touch with.

32:26.402 --> 32:30.698
Well, I... Steven at least bothered.

32:30.990 --> 32:31.991
There it is.

32:32.492 --> 32:36.579
Now we see what it looks like
when Alexis Carrington runs out of lies.

32:36.955 --> 32:39.916
You know, for a second,
for a split second,

32:39.999 --> 32:41.834
you had me believing you cared,

32:41.918 --> 32:43.962
but you don't care about anybody.

32:44.253 --> 32:46.756
What kind of woman
abandons their daughter?

32:47.173 --> 32:51.511
That's not true.
My feelings for my children are genuine.

32:51.970 --> 32:54.514
Nothing about you is genuine.

32:58.351 --> 33:01.187
You spiteful little brat.

33:11.406 --> 33:13.616
Okay, I better break this up.

33:14.033 --> 33:15.284
Don't you dare.

33:21.791 --> 33:25.461
- You were never a mother to us.
- As if anyone could mother you.

33:25.545 --> 33:29.215
- You were born an egomaniac.
- Like mother, like daughter.

33:31.509 --> 33:34.679
We should have spanked you more
as a child.

33:39.225 --> 33:41.728
I told you
she needed to see a specialist.

33:42.687 --> 33:46.941
- Now she's gone and lost her mind.
- That was subdued behavior for Fallon.

33:47.025 --> 33:50.945
- Your lies caught up with you, Alexis.
- You poisoned her against me.

33:51.029 --> 33:52.405
You poisoned yourself.

33:53.156 --> 33:54.782
What are you doing?

33:54.866 --> 33:57.410
- That's more typical.
- You may remember this.

33:57.994 --> 34:01.748
A little gift Mommy dearest sent me
for my sweet 16.

34:01.831 --> 34:04.709
- To show me how much she cared.
- Put that away.

34:05.043 --> 34:08.588
Listen to him, Fallon.
Sit down and let's talk about this.

34:08.670 --> 34:11.632
Why? So you can feed me more
of your lies?

34:11.716 --> 34:13.967
You want the house? Fine, take it.

34:14.052 --> 34:17.679
But if you think
we're gonna be one big happy family here,

34:17.764 --> 34:19.014
I have news for you.

34:21.809 --> 34:24.771
I will never... ever...

34:30.068 --> 34:32.235
live under the same roof as you again.

34:56.260 --> 34:57.094
Thank you.

35:00.306 --> 35:04.060
- Why didn't you ask for money last year?
- I didn't want you to think

35:04.143 --> 35:07.814
that's why I was reaching out.
And true, my finances aren't ideal,

35:07.897 --> 35:11.025
but it's nothing to worry about. Truly.

35:11.109 --> 35:15.321
Should've given me a heads-up.
Might have helped keep peace with Fallon.

35:15.404 --> 35:16.864
Ha. I doubt it.

35:17.115 --> 35:18.533
You know your sister.

35:21.869 --> 35:26.541
You were always my son
and she was always her father's daughter.

35:26.624 --> 35:30.586
I just don't want her mad at me.
You have no idea what that's like.

35:31.462 --> 35:33.923
Pool fights and bullet sprays aside.

35:34.298 --> 35:38.302
You know, most children of divorce
are forced to choose

35:38.386 --> 35:40.972
between their parents.
I just don't want Fallon

35:41.055 --> 35:45.601
to make you choose between mother and
sister. Family's complicated, isn't it?

35:46.602 --> 35:49.814
You'll understand it
once you start a family of your own.

35:51.566 --> 35:54.068
I actually... I wanted to tell you...

35:55.278 --> 35:56.279
I'm engaged.

35:58.614 --> 35:59.907
Well, that's fantastic.

35:59.991 --> 36:01.200
Do I know him?

36:01.742 --> 36:03.536
You've met him. It's Sam.

36:06.414 --> 36:07.498
Cristal's nephew?

36:10.918 --> 36:13.671
Oh, that is wonderful.

36:14.714 --> 36:17.341
Oh, Steven, congratulations.

36:20.178 --> 36:22.180
Michael, where have you been?

36:22.263 --> 36:26.017
Sorry I've been MIA. I got roped
into the Fallon side of this thing.

36:26.100 --> 36:28.186
She expects me to put my life on hold

36:28.269 --> 36:31.564
if she so much as chips a nail.
Not that I'm blaming her.

36:32.023 --> 36:34.901
If I don't set boundaries
and learn to say "no"...

36:34.984 --> 36:38.696
Trust me, I understand,
but that's not what this is about.

36:38.988 --> 36:42.700
Your mother has been trying to reach you,
and your sister called.

36:43.284 --> 36:45.786
I'm sorry. I've been meaning to call them,

36:45.870 --> 36:50.333
- but that's what I'm talking...
- Your father's been admitted to hospital.

36:52.335 --> 36:54.378
You need to talk to your family.

37:09.560 --> 37:12.313
Your door was unlocked.
That's a little unsafe.

37:13.940 --> 37:18.361
You probably keep your valuables in your
summer home. Is that a convertible?

37:19.487 --> 37:21.489
What do you want? Where's my dog?

37:22.406 --> 37:23.950
Krystle?

37:24.909 --> 37:25.743
Krystle?

37:28.537 --> 37:31.207
- Krystle?
- Your charade is over, Alexis.

37:31.457 --> 37:34.001
My lawyers discovered
that codicil is invalid.

37:34.252 --> 37:37.964
Turns out it was drawn up
when my father had open-heart surgery,

37:38.047 --> 37:42.760
and you coerced him to sign it
while he was still under heavy sedation.

37:42.843 --> 37:44.804
That is not true and you know it.

37:44.887 --> 37:47.223
I have an injunction against you
stepping foot on my property

37:47.306 --> 37:51.102
until the courts officially
overrule the codicil. Which they will.

37:51.185 --> 37:52.478
Once you pay them to.

37:54.230 --> 37:55.648
You can't do this to me.

37:56.357 --> 38:00.361
I will fight you harder this time
because I have nothing to lose.

38:00.611 --> 38:03.322
That is the first true thing you've said.

38:04.699 --> 38:08.619
I'm sorry about your dog.
He ran right out when I opened the door.

38:08.703 --> 38:10.830
Hope the coyotes don't get him.

38:17.753 --> 38:22.800
You son of a bitch! You're not gonna
get away with this, Blake Carrington!

38:23.801 --> 38:26.679
I'm gonna get everything back
that you took from me.

38:26.762 --> 38:30.433
My money, my house, my children!

38:31.350 --> 38:34.812
And you, you're the one
who's gonna end up living here

38:34.895 --> 38:37.481
until you rot in hell!

38:43.946 --> 38:45.031
Krystle!

38:46.407 --> 38:48.951
So, what do you have planned?
Another wedding?

38:49.827 --> 38:52.621
Funeral? A good gunfight outside a saloon?

38:53.247 --> 38:55.666
You haven't gotten to see my best side.

38:55.875 --> 38:57.960
My mother brings out the awful in me.

38:58.377 --> 39:02.298
I'm enjoying the free entertainment
that came with our arrangement.

39:02.381 --> 39:04.675
- You're not gonna move out?
- Not yet.

39:05.426 --> 39:07.803
- I'll keep you posted.
- Okay.

39:09.180 --> 39:11.182
Well, why don't you let me make up

39:11.265 --> 39:15.394
- for everything by taking you shopping?
- Not a reward for a straight guy.

39:15.478 --> 39:17.021
Sammy Jo gave me the once-over.

39:17.104 --> 39:20.733
Who said we were talking about clothes?
Let's go buy some cars.

39:21.150 --> 39:22.276
Mm.

39:22.985 --> 39:27.365
Perfect timing. Will you tell Culhane
to bring the car around? We're going out.

39:28.657 --> 39:31.035
- I'll be happy to take you.
- That's okay.

39:31.243 --> 39:34.663
- Culhane can drive us if he's available.
- Well, actually...

39:35.206 --> 39:38.125
Michael tendered his resignation
this morning.

39:39.377 --> 39:41.379
He no longer works for the family.

39:42.630 --> 39:46.092
If you're heading for the loft,
I have additional bad news.

39:51.138 --> 39:53.015
What part of "injunction"
don't you understand?

39:53.099 --> 39:55.851
Are you off your meds?
I've had time to reload.

39:55.935 --> 39:58.354
There's that wicked sense of humor again.

40:00.856 --> 40:03.859
Oh, Joseph, would you be a love
and bring me fresh linens?

40:04.151 --> 40:07.196
And maybe some pantry items, fresh pâté,

40:07.279 --> 40:09.782
tins of Beluga, and a case of champagne.

40:10.074 --> 40:12.076
- To celebrate.
- What are you doing?

40:12.243 --> 40:14.578
- This is Culhane's place.
- Not anymore.

40:15.079 --> 40:18.290
Well, it never really was.
Fallon, you might remember,

40:18.374 --> 40:21.085
through old photos in dusty albums,

40:21.168 --> 40:23.921
that this stable was built
on my family's farm.

40:25.172 --> 40:30.052
When Daddy and I were married,
his father bought the deed from my father.

40:30.219 --> 40:34.306
Which means we own it, along
with the house you tried to take from us.

40:34.390 --> 40:37.184
Actually, when I heard
there was a vacancy...

40:37.935 --> 40:39.728
I looked into the land rights.

40:39.812 --> 40:44.567
And as it turns out,
Thomas deeded this to me.

40:45.693 --> 40:48.571
Which means the land around the stables
belongs to you,

40:48.821 --> 40:50.573
but this is mine.

40:50.656 --> 40:52.783
- Well, that can't be true.
- Anders?

40:55.077 --> 40:58.789
I'm afraid she's right, sir.
I confirmed ownership this morning.

40:59.206 --> 41:00.207
Thank you.

41:03.461 --> 41:06.088
- You'll be hearing from my lawyers.
- I'll invite them,

41:06.172 --> 41:10.843
as well as you to the housewarming party.
He'll come around.

41:11.510 --> 41:15.514
It's the least I deserve considering
he stole the rest of the estate.

41:16.557 --> 41:19.351
He didn't take anything from you. I did.

41:21.103 --> 41:22.938
I paid off some anesthesiologist

41:23.022 --> 41:26.442
to change the time of Grandpa's surgery
to when the codicil was signed.

41:27.026 --> 41:30.821
I'm only telling you now
because you're too poor to prove it.

41:31.030 --> 41:33.491
You are your father all over again.

41:33.657 --> 41:34.492
Yeah.

41:34.742 --> 41:38.787
But Daddy was wrong
banishing you from our lives.

41:39.538 --> 41:43.042
Someone like you... needs to be destroyed.

41:43.918 --> 41:47.004
And you, my dear, need to be smothered.

41:48.422 --> 41:49.340
With love.

41:50.883 --> 41:55.304
For the first time in your life, I'm gonna
make you care about other people.

41:56.430 --> 42:00.309
And I am going to prove to you
just how much you really are loved.

42:00.601 --> 42:04.188
Even if it kills you, Fallon.
Because I am your damn mother.
