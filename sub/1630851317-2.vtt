onBob Hearts Abishola...

00:03.481 --> 00:06.006
Ooh, steamy, huh?

00:06.049 --> 00:07.529
It is Africa, Bob.

00:07.572 --> 00:10.010
So, what's the plan?
Settle in, shower,

00:10.053 --> 00:12.055
get Dele, take another shower?

00:12.099 --> 00:13.709
We're going straight to Dele.

00:13.752 --> 00:16.625
[exhales]
Just trying to do you a favor,
but okay.

00:19.062 --> 00:21.064
Where's my son?He's in his room.

00:21.108 --> 00:22.718
Dele?
DELE:
You'll never
take me alive!

00:22.761 --> 00:24.024
[groans]Dele!

00:24.067 --> 00:25.547
[door opens]

00:25.590 --> 00:27.027
Mom?

00:27.070 --> 00:29.551
Dele is thriving in Lagos.

00:29.594 --> 00:31.031
Here he will attend

00:31.074 --> 00:32.293
the best school

00:32.336 --> 00:34.164
and be around people
who share his culture.

00:34.208 --> 00:36.340
But he won't have you.

00:36.384 --> 00:39.517
I've always done
what's best for him.

00:39.561 --> 00:42.694
I cannot let this be
the one time I do not.

00:42.738 --> 00:45.175
[excited shouts]

00:45.219 --> 00:47.569
Tunde! Hey!
How long has it been!

00:47.612 --> 00:48.874
Come in!Too long!

00:48.918 --> 00:49.919
Come inside!

00:49.962 --> 00:51.964
Eh-eh."Eh-eh" what?

00:52.008 --> 00:54.576
We have not had a
formal introduction
between you and my family.

00:54.619 --> 00:58.580
Until then, you cannot
step foot in this house.

01:02.236 --> 01:04.455
[overlapping chatter]

01:04.499 --> 01:08.155
Mmm. This is delicious.

01:08.198 --> 01:09.286
What do they call it?

01:09.330 --> 01:11.288
Guinness.

01:11.332 --> 01:13.116
They have everything
over here.

01:13.160 --> 01:16.598
Domino's Pizza, KFC, cars.

01:17.555 --> 01:20.558
What, did you think we ate bugs
and rode buffaloes?

01:20.602 --> 01:24.214
Hey, Black Pantherjust
came out-- I'm still learning.

01:26.521 --> 01:28.392
Look at Abishola's
hot cousin.

01:29.350 --> 01:31.569
You think he needs
a green card?

01:31.613 --> 01:34.529
He owns three
pharmacies in Atlanta.

01:34.572 --> 01:36.792
But does he need
a green card?

01:38.359 --> 01:40.317
Mom, you're drinking?

01:40.361 --> 01:42.580
Lighten up, honey.
It's a wedding.

01:42.624 --> 01:43.755
This isn't the wedding.

01:44.756 --> 01:46.671
Then what the hell
am I doing here?

01:46.715 --> 01:49.109
I told you,
it's the introduction ceremony.

01:49.152 --> 01:50.545
As the elder
of our family,

01:50.588 --> 01:52.286
it's your job to give a speech
on my behalf.

01:52.329 --> 01:53.461
Well, that's fine.

01:53.504 --> 01:56.028
Beer makes me chatty.

01:57.160 --> 01:59.858
If everyone could please take
their seats?

02:11.261 --> 02:12.784
Mr. Bob Wheeler,

02:12.828 --> 02:16.353
what brings you before
the members of my family today?

02:16.397 --> 02:20.357
Uh, as is custom,
I am here to have my family

02:20.401 --> 02:22.098
meet yours.You have brought

02:22.142 --> 02:23.230
an elder with you.

02:23.273 --> 02:25.971
Please have them introduce you

02:26.015 --> 02:29.279
and explain why our families
should be joined together.

02:29.323 --> 02:31.803
FYI, she's fresh off a stroke.

02:31.847 --> 02:34.589
[whispers]:
I'm just lowering the bar.

02:34.632 --> 02:36.678
Help me.

02:46.122 --> 02:48.690
E kasan,

02:48.733 --> 02:51.171
Mr. and Mrs.
Odegbami.

02:51.214 --> 02:53.651
I am Dorothy Wheeler,

02:53.695 --> 02:56.698
and I am proud to say
that I'm Bob's mother.

02:56.741 --> 02:58.178
He is a kind

02:58.221 --> 02:59.831
and caring man,

02:59.875 --> 03:02.182
and he has always taken care
of his family.

03:02.225 --> 03:03.618
And I know he'll move

03:03.661 --> 03:05.750
heaven and earth
to take care of your daughter.

03:07.578 --> 03:08.666
Obafemi,

03:08.710 --> 03:11.147
Ebunoluwa,
we are honored

03:11.191 --> 03:13.758
to be guests in your home.

03:15.673 --> 03:17.545
Bow me!

03:25.857 --> 03:26.815
[clears throat]

03:26.858 --> 03:27.990
Thanks, Ma.

03:28.033 --> 03:29.252
EBUNOLUWA:
And next,

03:29.296 --> 03:32.386
we will hear
from Mr. Bob Wheeler.

03:32.429 --> 03:34.953
Good luck following that.

03:37.173 --> 03:40.959
["Ifanla" by Sola Akingbola
playing]

04:01.937 --> 04:05.027
We have so many blessings
to be thankful for.

04:05.070 --> 04:07.682
My beautiful daughter.

04:07.725 --> 04:09.727
She has made me
so proud

04:09.771 --> 04:11.903
by giving me a grandson

04:11.947 --> 04:15.733
and also by becoming
a world-class heart surgeon.

04:15.777 --> 04:17.082
She doesn't know
you're a nurse?

04:17.126 --> 04:18.910
Oh, she knows.

04:18.954 --> 04:21.043
And now she is marrying Bob,

04:21.086 --> 04:23.350
millionaire businessman,

04:23.393 --> 04:27.310
with a sock company bigger
than Nike and Adidas combined.

04:27.354 --> 04:28.703
Isn't that right, Bob?

04:29.704 --> 04:31.314
Yes, Mum.Mm.

04:31.358 --> 04:32.881
It feels like just yesterday

04:32.924 --> 04:35.927
when I introduced Bob
to Abishola.

04:35.971 --> 04:37.668
[scoffs]Which was

04:37.712 --> 04:39.453
after I looked
into his prospects

04:39.496 --> 04:42.586
and investigated
his business dealings.

04:42.630 --> 04:46.503
It is amazing you did
all that from here

04:46.547 --> 04:48.679
while I was the one in America.

04:48.723 --> 04:50.768
Yes, it is amazing.

04:50.812 --> 04:53.554
Iam amazing.

05:03.346 --> 05:05.348
E kaasan,Uncle.

05:05.392 --> 05:07.045
E kaasan,Uncle.

05:08.090 --> 05:10.310
Oh.

05:10.353 --> 05:12.355
[sighs]

05:23.192 --> 05:25.325
Speak.

05:25.368 --> 05:29.372
Mr. Odegbami, it's
an honor to meet you.

05:29.416 --> 05:32.810
I promise to provide your
daughter with a wonderful life.

05:32.854 --> 05:34.638
One where each moment

05:34.682 --> 05:37.554
is filled with joy,
love and fun.

05:37.598 --> 05:39.164
But not too much fun.

05:39.208 --> 05:40.340
I mean, we'll work a lot.

05:40.383 --> 05:42.080
We'll barely see each other,
really.

05:48.435 --> 05:51.351
One bag of salt,
one bottle of pure honey,

05:51.394 --> 05:55.006
41 kilos of yam,
one kilogram kola nuts...

05:55.050 --> 05:56.399
Is this a grocery list?

05:56.443 --> 05:57.574
Bride price.

05:57.618 --> 05:59.010
Cheaper than my first wife.

05:59.054 --> 06:00.055
[chuckles]

06:00.098 --> 06:01.796
Bow and go!

06:01.839 --> 06:03.101
Bowango.

06:03.145 --> 06:05.713
Bow and go.

06:05.756 --> 06:06.801
Oh.

06:10.413 --> 06:11.936
Granny and Auntie
are arguing

06:11.980 --> 06:13.155
about which one of them
named me.

06:13.198 --> 06:15.244
I named you.

06:15.287 --> 06:17.812
That's what I said,
but they said I wasn't born yet,

06:17.855 --> 06:19.117
what do I know?

06:20.510 --> 06:22.730
Nigeria will be good for you.

06:23.731 --> 06:26.298
I do feel different here.
I don't know what it is.

06:26.342 --> 06:27.735
You are happy.

06:29.737 --> 06:31.565
I will miss you.

06:32.566 --> 06:34.524
You have the best
of both worlds.

06:34.568 --> 06:37.527
Six months with your father
and six months with me.

06:37.571 --> 06:39.486
And you can
always come home.

06:39.529 --> 06:40.704
Always.

06:41.792 --> 06:43.272
Unless you take drugs.

06:43.315 --> 06:46.014
Or fail a test.

06:46.057 --> 06:48.016
Look who just wowed
an older gentleman

06:48.059 --> 06:50.279
and got
the bride price list.Ah.

06:50.322 --> 06:53.500
Such an antiquated
and sexist tradition.

06:53.543 --> 06:54.414
So I shouldn't do it?

06:54.457 --> 06:55.415
Of course you should.

06:55.458 --> 06:56.938
It's tradition.

06:56.981 --> 06:58.113
It will be an honor.

06:58.156 --> 06:59.157
I'm just worried

06:59.201 --> 07:00.376
I won't have time
to write my vows.

07:00.420 --> 07:02.552
Nigerian weddings
do not have vows.

07:02.596 --> 07:04.554
Well, that makes sense.
I mean, why bother telling

07:04.598 --> 07:06.251
the whole world
how much I love you

07:06.295 --> 07:08.645
when the yams and nuts
speak for themselves?

07:17.349 --> 07:20.091
Yeah, one kilogram of your
best kola nuts, please.

07:20.135 --> 07:22.311
Of course, sir.Ah.

07:22.354 --> 07:23.965
I got this.

07:24.008 --> 07:26.184
You don't have to do that.You're my big brother,

07:26.228 --> 07:28.099
my best friend--
the least I could do

07:28.143 --> 07:30.188
is help you purchase your wife
from her father.

07:30.232 --> 07:31.842
Thanks, pal.

07:34.192 --> 07:35.367
[groans]

07:35.411 --> 07:37.631
These taste like ass.

07:37.674 --> 07:39.589
Well, keep chewing.
Maybe it gets better.

07:40.547 --> 07:42.636
No, still ass.

07:42.679 --> 07:44.115
[laughs]

07:44.159 --> 07:46.335
[computer rings]

07:46.378 --> 07:47.771
Hello, Mr. Wheeler.

07:47.815 --> 07:49.643
E kasanfrom Lagos.

07:49.686 --> 07:51.688
E kasan.
How is everything going?

07:51.732 --> 07:54.169
It's going great.
We wish you were here.

07:54.212 --> 07:56.432
We wish we were invited.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.913
It feels so strange that you
are there and we are here

07:58.956 --> 08:00.784
running your sock business.

08:00.828 --> 08:03.221
You once said you could
not get married without us,

08:03.265 --> 08:05.049
and yet you are.

08:05.093 --> 08:07.182
As if socks are more important
than friendship.

08:07.225 --> 08:09.401
Totally!

08:10.577 --> 08:13.667
Hey, listen, have you guys
ever heard of eja osan?

08:13.710 --> 08:16.931
Oh, it is a very delicious
and expensive fish.

08:16.974 --> 08:19.063
We're in Balogun Market.
Do they have it here?

08:19.107 --> 08:20.630
You are in Balogun?

08:20.674 --> 08:23.633
I used to go there
with my grandmother.

08:23.677 --> 08:25.330
Oh, she's sick now.

08:25.374 --> 08:28.551
It would have been nice
to see her one last time.

08:28.595 --> 08:30.640
We're by the suitcases.

08:30.684 --> 08:33.338
Is it by the suitcases?

08:38.996 --> 08:42.347
[oohing and aahing]

08:42.391 --> 08:44.393
You look beautiful, Mummy.

08:44.436 --> 08:46.395
It's great,
Auntie Ebunoluwa.

08:46.438 --> 08:48.136
Thank you.
I told Bimpe

08:48.179 --> 08:51.139
I wanted enough crystals
to blind my enemies.

08:51.182 --> 08:52.749
BIMPE:
I will bring

08:52.793 --> 08:54.838
the rest of the dresses.

09:01.584 --> 09:04.239
I'll be able to cha-cha
down the aisle

09:04.282 --> 09:06.720
by the time she gets back.

09:06.763 --> 09:09.723
For each of you, I had
Bimpe make an iroand buba,

09:09.766 --> 09:11.681
a wrap skirt
with a matching blouse

09:11.725 --> 09:13.901
adorned with jewels,
just like mine.

09:13.944 --> 09:16.686
Mm-hmm. It's the traditional
Yoruba attire that we wear

09:16.730 --> 09:18.601
for weddings and funerals.

09:18.645 --> 09:20.385
And if done right,
you will look so good,

09:20.429 --> 09:22.518
even the dead person
will be jealous.

09:22.562 --> 09:23.475
[laughter]

09:24.999 --> 09:26.957
[oohing and aahing]

09:28.698 --> 09:29.743
How does it look?

09:29.786 --> 09:32.920
Ah. Absolutely stunning,
Auntie Olu.

09:32.963 --> 09:34.225
Gorgeous.

09:34.269 --> 09:35.923
It's just like
Auntie Ebun's.

09:35.966 --> 09:37.228
But better.

09:38.186 --> 09:41.711
Yes, you do look beautiful
in that dress.

09:41.755 --> 09:42.843
Thank you, sister.

09:42.886 --> 09:43.887
I will wear it.

09:43.931 --> 09:45.497
What?

09:45.541 --> 09:46.977
I am the mother
of the bride.

09:47.021 --> 09:49.240
It is only right that
I have the best dress.

09:49.284 --> 09:50.285
CHRISTINA:
Other than the bride,

09:50.328 --> 09:51.939
of course.

09:51.982 --> 09:53.723
No!

09:53.767 --> 09:55.420
Take off your dress
and give it to me.

09:55.464 --> 09:57.248
But the dress is mine.

09:58.162 --> 09:59.294
Abishola,

09:59.337 --> 10:01.601
there seems to be
some confusion.

10:01.644 --> 10:04.734
Could you remind us
who your mother is?

10:04.778 --> 10:06.649
You are.

10:06.693 --> 10:08.259
And?

10:10.610 --> 10:14.135
And the function of a wedding
is to honor our elders.

10:16.485 --> 10:18.400
Especially the mother.

10:21.403 --> 10:23.448
I will go change.

10:30.325 --> 10:33.197
I will try my dress on later.

10:35.547 --> 10:38.333
[drumming rhythm of "Let's Go"
by the Routers]

10:38.376 --> 10:39.682
Let's go!

10:42.032 --> 10:43.381
Let's go!Let's go!

10:43.425 --> 10:45.253
What is going on?

10:45.296 --> 10:47.690
An ududrum? That
is not on the list.

10:47.734 --> 10:49.039
Oh, we got all the stuff.

10:49.083 --> 10:50.606
Now we're just going
for extra credit.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.608
You're not getting "stuff."

10:52.652 --> 10:54.828
You are acknowledging
our traditions.

10:54.871 --> 10:56.438
Every item

10:56.481 --> 10:57.744
has a deeper meaning.

10:57.787 --> 11:00.268
I'm sure we can make up
something for the drum.

11:00.311 --> 11:02.618
Do you know why
you're getting yams?

11:03.619 --> 11:05.447
Because they're
on the list.

11:05.490 --> 11:09.059
Because they represent how
you will provide for your wife.

11:09.103 --> 11:10.539
A skinny yam

11:10.582 --> 11:13.063
means a starving wife.

11:14.978 --> 11:17.894
Is this the finest
yam in the market?

11:17.938 --> 11:19.548
I don't know. I just grabbed it.
