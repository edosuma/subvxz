00:11.778 --> 00:14.346
  Both: ¶ deck the halls with
       boughs of holly ¶

00:14.348 --> 00:16.782
        ¶ fa la la la la
         la la la la ¶

00:16.784 --> 00:19.051
             - Hey!

00:22.255 --> 00:23.522
  - Merry christmas eve, will.

00:23.524 --> 00:24.623
      What are you doing?

00:24.625 --> 00:26.158
  You can't throw these cards
             away.

00:26.160 --> 00:29.061
These people took their time to
        write you cards.

00:29.063 --> 00:32.164
  Look, there's jasmine, jade,
        robert freeman.

00:32.165 --> 00:33.499
     Do you have a brother?

00:33.501 --> 00:35.401
      - That's my father.
  Put that back in the trash.

00:35.403 --> 00:38.203
  Marcus, put that back in the
      garbage, right now!

00:38.205 --> 00:42.207
     - "dear william, merry
        christmas. Dad."

00:42.209 --> 00:45.344
      Wow, what a nice...
          Penmanship.

00:45.346 --> 00:47.379
   - Who has nice penmanship?

00:47.381 --> 00:49.548
- Uh, will just got a christmas
       card from his dad.

00:49.550 --> 00:51.483
     - Oh, isn't that nice.

00:51.485 --> 00:53.652
Oh, is that why your house isn't
           decorated,

00:53.654 --> 00:55.320
   'cause you're gonna spend
    christmas with your dad?

00:55.322 --> 00:57.189
    - No, I don't celebrate
           christmas.

00:57.191 --> 00:58.524
            - What?
 - How could you not celebrate

00:58.526 --> 00:59.792
  Christmas, it's the greatest
      holiday of all time?

00:59.794 --> 01:02.628
     - Okay, the day after
         thanksgiving,

01:02.630 --> 01:05.164
   Every radio station, mall,
   and restaurant in america

01:05.166 --> 01:07.733
 Begins playing <i> runaway sleigh</i>
          incessantly.

01:07.735 --> 01:10.269
 I can't leave my house without
       hearing that song.

01:10.271 --> 01:13.138
- An awesome song, an even more
      awesome songwriter.

01:13.140 --> 01:14.339
    I fail to see the issue.

01:14.341 --> 01:17.342
    - The issue is, marcus,
      I despise that song

01:17.344 --> 01:20.112
 With the white hot anger of a
         thousand suns.

01:20.114 --> 01:23.248
  And, for some reason, I just
  don't feel like celebrating

01:23.250 --> 01:25.317
 An imaginary fat man in a red
             suit.

01:25.319 --> 01:26.819
             - Hey!
              Hey!

01:26.821 --> 01:28.654
          - Imaginary?
       Santa's imaginary?

01:28.656 --> 01:29.755
             - No!
    - Marcus still believes

01:29.757 --> 01:32.424
        In santa clause?
       - He--yes, he do!

01:32.426 --> 01:36.195
     Now look, when he says
           imaginary,

01:36.197 --> 01:38.197
He doesn't mean it in the sense
          of made up.

01:38.199 --> 01:43.202
  He means, more, in the sense
   that he's not often seen,

01:43.204 --> 01:45.871
     He's mysterious like a
    will-o'-the-wisp, like--

01:45.873 --> 01:47.840
 - That's not the definition of
           imaginary.

01:47.842 --> 01:50.876
 - Ah, let's do more decorating
   at home because it's very

01:50.878 --> 01:53.245
      Depressing in here.
          Off you go.

01:53.247 --> 01:54.780
           Off you--

01:54.782 --> 01:57.282
 Any other dreams you'd like to
       kill, mr. Scrooge?

01:57.284 --> 02:00.219
- Yeah, bring him back in here,
   I'll take care of unicorns

02:00.221 --> 02:01.286
    And milli vanilli, too.

02:01.288 --> 02:03.355
       - Don't you dare.

02:10.330 --> 02:14.900
- Yeah, this website always has
   the most heart-felt cards.

02:14.902 --> 02:17.903
         [perky music]

02:17.905 --> 02:19.738
              ¶ ¶

02:19.740 --> 02:22.407
       ¶ well maybe it's
       the common curse ¶

02:42.329 --> 02:44.830
           [applause]

02:46.266 --> 02:49.701
  - Man, snowflakes look much
     lighter than they are.

02:49.703 --> 02:51.370
        So much glitter.

02:51.372 --> 02:53.572
- We need to settle this thing,
             will.

02:53.574 --> 02:55.941
     - Why would I settle?
       I wrote the song.

02:55.943 --> 02:57.576
     Stalker stacey did not
        write the song.

02:57.578 --> 02:59.411
   She is attempting to steal
           my money.

02:59.413 --> 03:01.346
   - I've been talking to her
 lawyers all week and I finally

03:01.348 --> 03:05.350
You only have to give her a tiny
 percentage of your royalties.

03:05.352 --> 03:06.718
         A small taste.

03:06.720 --> 03:08.687
          Just let her
    get her beak wet, will.

03:08.689 --> 03:11.290
- Forget it, counselor, I am not
           settling.

03:11.292 --> 03:13.358
- Will, you do not want this to
          go to trial.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.761
 There's no telling what a jury
   of your peers will decide.

03:15.763 --> 03:17.329
   I mean, aren't there more
    important things in life

03:17.331 --> 03:19.298
          Than money?
     It's christmas, will.

03:19.300 --> 03:20.632
 - I'm not giving her a penny,
             okay?

03:20.634 --> 03:23.268
 - Well, unless you've got hard
           evidence,

03:23.270 --> 03:24.469
  She's gonna own your house.

03:24.471 --> 03:26.838
          - Evidence.
 Evidence, evidence, evidence.

03:26.840 --> 03:28.674
           Evidence.

03:28.676 --> 03:30.509
           Evidence.

03:30.511 --> 03:33.278
    I am gonna give you some
      evidence, counselor.

03:33.280 --> 03:37.416
  We are gonna fight the good
 fight, for justice, together.

03:37.418 --> 03:38.750
  No matter how long it takes.

    Will freeman is going to
          washington.

03:43.791 --> 03:46.225
      The papers, cuckoo.
       [knocking on door]

03:46.227 --> 03:47.359
         - You got it!

03:47.361 --> 03:50.329
            Mm. Mm.
             Boop.

03:50.331 --> 03:51.563
           - [sighs]
             okay.

03:51.565 --> 03:53.432
 Well, the joke's on you, will,

03:53.434 --> 03:55.334
    Because I brought tape!

03:55.336 --> 03:57.236
 - Will, I figured out why you
     don't like christmas.

03:57.238 --> 03:59.004
 You don't like christmas cause
 you don't like <i> runaway sleigh.</i>

03:59.006 --> 04:03.275
 Cause you've gotten so sick of
 hearing the same old version.

04:03.277 --> 04:04.776
   But here, check this out.

04:04.778 --> 04:07.012
  The new version by nasty dog
      just dropped today.

04:07.014 --> 04:09.581
       - ¶ off to school
        one winter day ¶

04:09.583 --> 04:11.817
        ¶ I came across
       a big red sleigh ¶

04:11.819 --> 04:13.952
          ¶ cursing it
      with all his might ¶

04:13.954 --> 04:15.721
     ¶ was a man whose face
       I knew on sight ¶

04:15.723 --> 04:17.255
          - Nasty dog.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.390
   - That's right, nasty dog.

04:18.392 --> 04:19.591
              Huh?
     Pretty good, huh, pal?

04:19.593 --> 04:24.363
   Hey, long story short, me,
      laurie and the kids,

04:24.365 --> 04:26.498
We're coming over to fiona's for
           christmas.

04:26.500 --> 04:28.667
   And I know you don't like
 celebrating christmas with us,

04:28.669 --> 04:31.270
 No matter how many times I get
     emotional when I ask,

04:31.272 --> 04:33.505
 But, we're gonna be so close,
        you can come by,

04:33.507 --> 04:36.008
   We'll all spend christmas
         together, huh?

04:36.010 --> 04:40.279
 - That sounds about as good as
           that song.

04:40.281 --> 04:42.781
   - That means he's coming!

04:45.618 --> 04:45.851
               .

04:45.853 --> 04:47.519
            - Right.
  - Don't start, I'm leaving.

04:47.521 --> 04:48.854
     - First of all, rude.

04:48.856 --> 04:50.989
  Second of all, I need you to
          watch marcus

04:50.991 --> 04:53.292
 So I can go fix the damage you
      caused when you said

04:53.294 --> 04:54.660
  That christmas wasn't real.

04:54.662 --> 04:57.462
  - No, I can't, and how am I
        supposed to know

04:57.464 --> 04:59.665
 That marcus would be the only
     12-year-old in america

04:59.667 --> 05:01.033
     Who still believes in
         santa clause?

05:01.035 --> 05:03.502
Oh, that's right, he was raised
       by dr. Strangemom.

05:03.504 --> 05:06.038
  - We have been, essentially,
  nomadic in our lives, will,

05:06.040 --> 05:08.807
But the one constant that I have
           maintained

05:08.809 --> 05:10.309
   Is a wonderful christmas.

05:10.311 --> 05:12.644
  Therefore, you have to watch
            marcus.

05:12.646 --> 05:15.714
 - Well, why don't you ask good
  old saint nick to watch him?

05:15.716 --> 05:17.082
 I'm sure you still believe in
          him, right?

05:17.084 --> 05:18.650
  - I do, as a matter of fact.

05:18.652 --> 05:22.888
  - Well no, I believe in the
    spirit of santa clause.

05:22.890 --> 05:25.324
        And by the way,
   I can't believe you don't?

05:25.326 --> 05:27.526
   You wrote a song that has
         instilled joy

05:27.528 --> 05:29.528
    Into millions of people.

05:29.530 --> 05:31.730
- Uh, it was a writing gig that
            hit big,

05:31.732 --> 05:33.532
  It means absolutely nothing
             to me.

05:33.534 --> 05:36.635
 - That's like a lottery winner
   hating his lottery ticket.

05:36.637 --> 05:38.503
          - Hey, will.
             - Hey.

05:38.505 --> 05:39.938
- My mom says I'm with you today
      because of the whole

05:39.940 --> 05:41.606
        Fat man fiasco.

05:41.608 --> 05:43.075
      - Oh, sorry, but no,
       I'm on a mission.

05:43.077 --> 05:45.110
     - It's not a request.
  My mom doesn't think you're

05:45.112 --> 05:48.447
     Very stable right now,
    so I'm on suicide watch.

05:48.449 --> 05:49.915
      I'm your sanity elf.
             - Hmm.

05:49.917 --> 05:52.017
 Okay, you can be my sanity elf
    if you can find my keys.

05:52.019 --> 05:53.352
   - Check your left pocket.

05:53.354 --> 05:56.121
     - I all ready checked
        my left pocket--

05:56.123 --> 05:57.456
        - Oh, excellent,
      that's settled then.

05:57.458 --> 05:58.623
         - Oh, hey mom.
       - Hello, darling.

05:58.625 --> 06:01.593
          - Let's go!
          Chop, chop!

06:01.595 --> 06:03.528
     - So if you find these
      hand-written lyrics

06:03.530 --> 06:06.665
Then you can prove that you, and
   you alone, wrote the song.

06:06.667 --> 06:07.899
         - Uh, exactly.

06:07.901 --> 06:09.901
              Yes.
  - So you can keep the money,

06:09.903 --> 06:12.537
 Even though you hate the song.

06:12.539 --> 06:16.608
   - Now, you are getting it.
    Oh, ho, ho, there it is!

06:16.610 --> 06:17.909
            - Whoa.
          What is it?

06:17.911 --> 06:21.546
- That, miniature tim, is where
       my band, sriracha,

06:21.548 --> 06:25.083
     Lived, and rehearsed,
   and partied, and did lots

06:25.085 --> 06:26.985
Of other stuff back in the day.

06:26.987 --> 06:30.589
  Have you ever approached the
  city about making this place

06:30.591 --> 06:32.391
     A historical landmark?

06:32.393 --> 06:35.460
          - Tried to.
  A little too much paperwork.

06:36.763 --> 06:37.829
       - May I help you?

06:37.831 --> 06:40.432
  - Uh, I got kind of a weird
            request.

06:40.434 --> 06:41.633
         - Oh, my god.

06:41.635 --> 06:43.602
      You're will freeman
         from sriracha!

06:43.604 --> 06:45.404
            - Yeah.
     - Yo, come on in, man.

06:45.406 --> 06:47.072
          Guys, guys.
Will freeman, the heart and soul

06:47.074 --> 06:50.642
   Of sriracha's here, holy--
        - oh, hey boys.

06:50.644 --> 06:52.043
       - Hey, thank you.
           Oh sweet--

06:52.045 --> 06:53.645
   Whoa, whoa, whoa, no, no,
     you can't have a beer.

06:53.647 --> 06:56.515
     - Just let me hold it,
        it's christmas.

06:56.517 --> 06:58.083
  - Okay, knock yourself out.

06:58.085 --> 07:01.953
      - This my band, bro.
   We got anton, pete, c.J.

07:01.955 --> 07:03.054
         - Yo, yo, yo!

07:03.056 --> 07:05.857
     - C.J., we had a t.J.
          That's nuts.

07:05.859 --> 07:07.926
- Sriracha are like gods to us,
              bro.

07:07.928 --> 07:10.729
 - Oh, that's awesome, look at
   you, you got the posters.

07:10.731 --> 07:12.597
- Whatever happened to you guys,
              man?

07:12.599 --> 07:14.933
    - Things--I don't know,
    the--the, I don't know,

07:14.935 --> 07:17.436
         Life happened.
           [laughter]

07:17.438 --> 07:21.139
Yeah, the band broke up--I'm not
      sure, exactly, when.

07:21.141 --> 07:23.575
  - Oh, as the chief editor of
   sriracha's wikipedia page,

07:23.577 --> 07:26.945
     The last known concert
     appearance by sriracha

07:26.947 --> 07:29.014
    Was February 19th, 2005.

07:29.016 --> 07:31.650
- So what've you guys been doin'
          since, huh?

07:31.652 --> 07:33.218
 - Oh, you know, this and that,
         nothing much.

07:33.220 --> 07:34.986
 - Oh, as chief editor of will
   freeman's wikipedia page,

07:34.988 --> 07:36.688
 I can help with that as well.

07:36.690 --> 07:38.790
- I don't think these guys wanna
 hear about the boring details

07:38.792 --> 07:40.959
   Of my life after sriracha,
            marcus.

07:40.961 --> 07:43.094
- What's so boring about writing
        <i> runaway sleigh,</i>

07:43.096 --> 07:47.032
    One of the most popular
 christmas songs of the decade?

07:47.034 --> 07:50.001
  - You wrote <i> runaway sleigh?</i>

07:50.003 --> 07:52.103
- I'm not sure if that's a good
     thing or a bad thing,

07:52.105 --> 07:54.773
     But yeah, yeah I did.
         - You sellout!

07:54.775 --> 07:56.708
 - Bad thing, yeah, I was kinda
    leaning that direction.

07:56.710 --> 08:00.946
- Uh,<i> runaway sleigh</i> had nothing
to do with sriracha breaking up.

08:00.948 --> 08:04.049
   - Okay, well this has been
           horrific.

08:04.051 --> 08:06.017
  Um, I'm gonna go upstairs to
your attic and get some boxes--

08:06.019 --> 08:08.887
- No, there's nothing up in the
          attic, bro.

08:08.889 --> 08:12.657
This woman came by about a year
ago, cleared out all the boxes.

08:12.659 --> 08:16.194
- Yeah, milady said she used to
 play tambourine for you guys.

08:16.196 --> 08:17.529
            - Okay.

08:17.531 --> 08:19.097
  - Out of the house, sellout.

08:19.099 --> 08:20.866
 - Okay, you gonna take my beer
       and not the kid's?

08:20.868 --> 08:22.100
 - I'm not gonna take the kid's
             beer,

08:22.102 --> 08:24.970
  He didn't destroy sriracha.

08:24.972 --> 08:27.038
  - Stop, the sign on the door
         says "closed."

08:27.040 --> 08:29.941
 - Well, most of our customers
           can read.

08:29.943 --> 08:31.276
  - Oh, well that's not nice,
             is it?

08:31.278 --> 08:33.645
  Now, we need a snow machine,
      that's all we need.

08:33.647 --> 08:36.581
 - It's christmas eve, the snow
  machines have been sold out

08:36.582 --> 08:38.517
           For weeks.
      - Yeah, but listen.

08:38.519 --> 08:41.653
   My son is starting not to
      believe in the magic

08:41.655 --> 08:43.822
         Of christmas.
   And so, if I can give him

08:43.823 --> 08:45.090
   A white christmas here in
          california,

08:45.092 --> 08:49.961
 So please, you have to sell me
   or rent me a snow machine.

08:49.963 --> 08:51.663
            Please.
  - And what about that baby,

08:51.665 --> 08:54.165
          Right there?
        - It's a return.

08:54.167 --> 08:55.934
 It burnt someone's garage down

08:55.936 --> 08:59.738
You could fix it with your tool
belt, handy andy andy, come on.

08:59.740 --> 09:01.673
 Come on, with your little tool
             belt?

09:01.675 --> 09:03.074
- How--how big of a fire are we
         talking about?

09:03.076 --> 09:06.177
 - I have serious doubts about
             that.

09:06.179 --> 09:08.246
  - Okay, good, we'll take it.

09:10.016 --> 09:12.117
   - Okay, so it's true debby
     caruso played a little

09:12.119 --> 09:14.586
 Tambo for sriracha, but let's
   just say she was more like

09:14.588 --> 09:16.187
  My main squeeze at the time.

09:16.189 --> 09:18.623
       Supermodel's face,
         dancer's body,

09:18.625 --> 09:23.995
   Style like audrey hepburn.

09:23.997 --> 09:27.098
Oh, I'm looking for debb caruso?

09:27.100 --> 09:30.135
      - Oh, my god, will!

09:30.137 --> 09:32.938
           - Debb...
    What did you do to debb?

09:32.940 --> 09:36.308
 - Oh, what are you doing here,
   come inside, come inside.

09:36.310 --> 09:38.143
  Kids, come here, come here!

09:38.145 --> 09:42.681
You're not going to believe it,
 this is my old bandmate, will.

09:42.683 --> 09:48.053
  Kids, this is will freeman,
     mommy's special friend

09:48.055 --> 09:49.821
       From before daddy.

09:49.823 --> 09:51.356
     - That's kind of icky.

09:51.358 --> 09:52.824
             - Hi.
           - Oh, hi.

09:52.826 --> 09:56.795
    - Hi, bill, this is will
            freeman.

09:56.797 --> 09:59.064
 - I was just telling your wife
 how highly will speaks of her.

09:59.066 --> 10:01.132
 He said she breaks records for
           endurance.

10:01.134 --> 10:03.301
  - Running partners, five ks.

10:03.303 --> 10:05.670
 - Felt more like ten ks, will.

10:05.672 --> 10:09.641
 - Did you find a picture frame
  with the old <i> runaway sleigh</i>

10:09.643 --> 10:11.309
        Lyrics in them?
   - Oh, I sold them on ebay.

10:11.311 --> 10:13.979
 - You sold my lyrics on ebay?

10:13.981 --> 10:15.914
 - You know what, I might have
       the fedex receipt

10:15.916 --> 10:17.882
  In my ebay box, I'll go and
          look, okay?

10:17.884 --> 10:19.851
         - Okay, great.
          - Hey, will,

10:19.853 --> 10:21.720
  Do you think that maybe you
    could sing a few lyrics

10:21.722 --> 10:23.154
      From <i> runaway sleigh</i>
          for my kids?

10:23.156 --> 10:24.689
     - Oh, absolutely not.

10:24.691 --> 10:28.660
  All: ¶ won't you ride in my
        runaway sleigh ¶

10:28.662 --> 10:33.098
 ¶ the reindeer might be biting
but they seem to know the way ¶

10:33.100 --> 10:37.168
¶ and we can fly these presents
to the good girls and the boys ¶

10:37.170 --> 10:41.106
      ¶ and we'll all have
      a merry christmas ¶

10:41.108 --> 10:45.176
¶ and we can fly these presents
to the good girls and the boys ¶

10:45.178 --> 10:52.917
  ¶ and we'll all have a merry
          christmas ¶

10:52.919 --> 10:54.986
- Oh, hey, now I understand why
      you hate christmas.

10:54.988 --> 10:56.955
 You hate christmas because you
      hate <i> runaway sleigh,</i>

10:56.957 --> 10:59.391
  And you hate runaway sleigh
  because it just reminds you

10:59.393 --> 11:01.326
  Of how much time has passed.

11:01.328 --> 11:03.762
Everybody's moved on with their
 lives but you're just kind of

11:03.764 --> 11:04.863
       Stuck in neutral.

11:04.865 --> 11:06.698
        - [buzzer sound]
          wrong again.

11:06.700 --> 11:08.299
             Okay.

11:08.301 --> 11:12.370
    812...Hill grass avenue.

11:17.110 --> 11:21.046
   - Might wanna stay outside
     for this one, marcus.

11:21.048 --> 11:24.049
         [cello music]

11:24.051 --> 11:31.122
              ¶ ¶

11:32.792 --> 11:33.858
              Dad.

11:40.099 --> 11:40.331
               .

11:40.333 --> 11:42.434
           - Well...

11:42.436 --> 11:43.835
 Look what the cat dragged in.

11:43.837 --> 11:46.404
            - O.M.G.
       You're will's dad.

11:46.406 --> 11:48.339
      History is happening
        before my eyes.

11:48.341 --> 11:52.477
Oh, can you guys pose, cause I'm
   gonna take a little picky

11:52.479 --> 11:54.279
         For the wiki.
- Marcus, we're not gonna pose.

11:54.281 --> 11:59.718
 - Let me guess, his mom was a
 groupie and he's my grandson.

11:59.720 --> 12:01.886
          - Good one.
  No, he's my neighbor's kid.

12:01.888 --> 12:03.388
 - Look, I really don't want to
            be here,

12:03.390 --> 12:05.924
And I'm obviously interrupting a
       super weird party,

12:05.926 --> 12:07.459
So I'll get right to the point.

12:07.461 --> 12:10.361
I need my <i> runaway sleigh</i> lyrics.
    Somebody at this address

12:10.363 --> 12:12.197
          Bought them.
    I'm assuming it was mom

12:12.199 --> 12:14.365
    Before you torpedoed the
     marriage and she moved

12:14.367 --> 12:18.336
    But if you do have them,
          I need them.

12:18.338 --> 12:20.205
    - Are you gonna come in?

12:20.207 --> 12:22.273
            - Fine.

12:24.043 --> 12:26.377
   - I'm walking into will's
        childhood home.

12:26.379 --> 12:28.947
Oh, I'm gonna journal about this
            so hard.

12:31.117 --> 12:33.384
  - Ooh, it smells like toast.

12:33.386 --> 12:36.488
 - I'm turbo charging this baby
       so marcus can have

12:36.490 --> 12:38.156
    A very white christmas.

12:38.158 --> 12:40.525
  - Oh, how confident are you,
             andy?

12:40.527 --> 12:43.128
 - Well, shooting for quadruple
            output,

12:43.130 --> 12:44.829
   But I'd settle for double.

12:44.831 --> 12:46.998
            - Great.
        Now who's that?

12:47.000 --> 12:48.233
  Who's that bloke with will,

12:48.235 --> 12:50.168
    Marcus keeps texting me
           pictures.

12:50.170 --> 12:52.170
      - That's will's dad.
           - [gasps]

12:52.172 --> 12:55.006
          How lovely.

12:55.008 --> 13:00.512
         - Not lovely.
      Explosive, actually.

13:00.514 --> 13:02.347
         - Here you go.

13:02.349 --> 13:04.415
          One eggnog.
        - Okay, thanks.

13:04.417 --> 13:08.953
      - That's all right,
    he likes to hold liquor.

13:08.955 --> 13:11.289
  - Well, what do ya say, you
  wanna sit down at the piano

13:11.291 --> 13:12.423
      And play something?
           - Really?

13:12.425 --> 13:13.992
 You--who am I gonna play for?

13:13.994 --> 13:15.460
          These guys?
 I mean, they look like they're

13:15.462 --> 13:16.461
      Waiting for the bus.

13:16.463 --> 13:18.129
      Where are my lyrics?

13:18.131 --> 13:20.198
     - How is your mother?
 - Can we skip the small talk,

13:20.200 --> 13:21.466
            Please?
         - Just asking.

13:21.468 --> 13:23.468
         - She's lousy,
    that's how she is, okay.

13:23.470 --> 13:25.870
 Her stubborn husband wouldn't
      leave his dingy-ass,

13:25.872 --> 13:28.373
 Hell hole in berkeley and move
      to florida with her.

13:28.375 --> 13:29.507
    - What was I gonna do in
            florida?

13:29.509 --> 13:31.442
        - I don't know,
       be with your wife,

13:31.444 --> 13:34.012
   Have dinner at 3:00 p.M.,
  live in the beautiful house

13:34.014 --> 13:36.447
         I bought you?
 - Oh, that place was way, way

13:36.449 --> 13:38.850
        Too big for us.
    - Oh, baloney, that's--

13:38.852 --> 13:41.352
You couldn't stand to live in a
    house that I bought you

13:41.354 --> 13:45.456
Because then you'd have to admit
   that I'd made it, my way.

13:45.458 --> 13:47.025
 - What are you talking about?

13:47.027 --> 13:50.395
  - I'm talking about the fact
     that the minute I left

13:50.397 --> 13:53.531
  Classical music and pursued
    the music that I loved,

13:53.533 --> 13:56.401
  - That's not the way it was,
             will.

13:56.403 --> 13:59.103
  Now it's true, I never have
     understood your music,

13:59.105 --> 14:03.274
   But I was always fine with
  pursuing anything you loved.

14:03.276 --> 14:06.945
 No, it was when you sold that
silly song and then you stopped.

14:06.947 --> 14:08.580
You just up and stopped trying.

14:08.582 --> 14:10.248
      - I stopped trying?

14:10.250 --> 14:13.318
I stopped trying 'cause I don't
         play weddings

14:13.320 --> 14:15.119
    On the weekends for $50?

14:15.121 --> 14:16.421
   - All right, listen will,
I don't want to fight with you,

14:16.423 --> 14:18.323
      It's christmas eve.

14:18.325 --> 14:20.391
I'll tell you what, why don't we
 just play that brahms concerto

14:20.393 --> 14:22.227
 In d minor, that was always--

14:22.229 --> 14:24.963
        - We're leaving.
      Where are my lyrics?

14:24.965 --> 14:26.497
  - I don't have your lyrics,
             will.

14:26.499 --> 14:28.399
 You're gonna have to call your
            mother.

14:28.401 --> 14:30.501
            - Okay.
     Marcus, we're leaving.

14:30.503 --> 14:32.570
  Say goodbye to your friends.

14:42.414 --> 14:47.385
 Would it have hurt you so much
          to just say,

14:47.387 --> 14:51.422
"you wrote a hit song, will, and
 you made a lot of people happy

14:51.424 --> 14:55.493
         At christmas,
     and I'm proud of you"?

14:58.530 --> 15:01.599
   Would it have killed you?

15:06.071 --> 15:09.140
        Come on, marcus,
    your mom's expecting us.

15:15.147 --> 15:18.483
    - Oh, I think I finally
          understand.

15:18.485 --> 15:21.519
 You hate christmas because you
      hate <i> runaway sleigh,</i>

15:21.521 --> 15:23.421
  And you hate <i> runaway sleigh</i>
       because it ruined

15:23.423 --> 15:27.525
  Your relationship with your
            father.

15:27.527 --> 15:30.595
       - Come on, marcus,
     let's get out of here.

15:36.235 --> 15:36.467
               .

15:36.469 --> 15:39.671
       ¶ sharing so much
        joy and cheer ¶

15:46.178 --> 15:50.982
  - Oh, it was a real yule log
           of a day.

15:50.984 --> 15:53.051
            [sighs]

15:54.653 --> 15:56.254
    - You know, it's funny.

15:56.256 --> 15:58.990
   I used to think, you know,
  "why does dad love penguins

15:58.992 --> 16:00.291
    "more than he loves me?

16:00.293 --> 16:03.227
Why can't he be more of a dad?"

16:03.229 --> 16:05.997
You know, hang around the house,
           watch tv,

16:05.999 --> 16:08.366
  Live on the same continent?

16:08.368 --> 16:12.203
      But the problem is,
    you can't pick your dad.

16:12.205 --> 16:17.008
     But the cool thing is,
 is you can pick your friends.

16:17.010 --> 16:21.212
      And I'm really glad
         you picked me.

16:21.214 --> 16:25.216
 - You're a really, really wise
        person, marcus.

16:25.218 --> 16:26.217
        - Thanks, will.

16:26.219 --> 16:29.454
   - Ow, stop, it's too hard.

16:29.456 --> 16:31.189
 - You know, sometimes it helps
          me to howl.

16:31.191 --> 16:32.724
       - What's that now?

16:32.726 --> 16:35.326
 - Well, my mom taught me that,
  when I'm upset about things,

16:35.328 --> 16:38.363
     You know, big things,
     it's healthy to howl.

16:38.365 --> 16:41.566
 - Yeah, I'm not sure that's a
 universally recognized wisdom.

16:41.568 --> 16:44.535
          - [howling]

16:44.537 --> 16:46.204
           - Marcus--

16:46.206 --> 16:48.740
  Uh, marcus, we're in public.

16:48.742 --> 16:51.376
Marcus, you gotta stop, I'm not
       gonna howl with--

16:51.378 --> 16:57.448
        Both: [howling]

17:03.422 --> 17:06.324
- I just got a text from marcus,
  they'll be here in a minute.

17:06.326 --> 17:07.759
  - You guys ready for a white
           christmas?

17:07.761 --> 17:09.527
           All: Yeah.

17:09.529 --> 17:13.431
 - I said, are you ready for a
        white christmas?

17:14.566 --> 17:16.501
             - Oh!
              Oh!

17:16.502 --> 17:18.803
 - Dad's hanging off the roof!

17:18.805 --> 17:22.306
           - Oh, my--
       you clumsy idiot.

17:22.308 --> 17:24.742
   I am not gonna raise four
      children by myself.

17:24.743 --> 17:27.377
         - Andy! Andy!

17:27.380 --> 17:30.214
   - Oh, quick--let's--just--

17:30.216 --> 17:31.816
            Grab on.

17:31.818 --> 17:34.085
          - [screams]

17:35.220 --> 17:36.421
          Oh, my god.

17:36.423 --> 17:39.657
        All right, andy.

17:39.659 --> 17:41.392
    - I am so sorry, fiona.

17:41.394 --> 17:45.263
   - Oh, no, it's all right.
    I mean, you're not dead.

17:45.265 --> 17:48.466
     Plan a was a disaster,
    but we'll get a plan b.

17:48.468 --> 17:49.467
     I don't have a plan b.

17:49.469 --> 17:52.270
 But you know, it's christmas.

17:52.272 --> 17:53.738
        - I almost died.
   - That's what you get for

17:53.740 --> 17:55.740
    Trying to be a show off.
