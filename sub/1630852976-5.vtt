PICARD:
Until the auto-repair
heats the ship,

00:12.751 --> 00:16.059
why don't we find you somewhere
where we can light a fire?

00:16.103 --> 00:17.974
What do you want?

00:18.018 --> 00:20.542
A chorus of thoughts to drown
the gnawing silence,

00:20.585 --> 00:21.804
but from you,

00:21.847 --> 00:24.198
I'll settle for your ship.

00:24.241 --> 00:27.201
BORG QUEEN:
Poor Agnes Jurati.
Left behind again.

00:27.244 --> 00:29.855
You felt it, too, didn't you?

00:29.899 --> 00:31.248
Connection.

00:31.292 --> 00:34.208
You've impressed me.

00:34.251 --> 00:37.341
Laris, last night. I was...

00:37.385 --> 00:40.388
-You.
-Nothing has to change.

00:40.431 --> 00:42.477
It's too late for that,
Jean-Luc.

00:42.520 --> 00:45.262
-You lost someone.
-We're getting him back.

00:45.306 --> 00:47.177
And losing him
was not your fault.

00:47.221 --> 00:49.005
RAFFI:
What I want is to try
to figure out

00:49.049 --> 00:50.746
how to fix the timeline.

00:50.789 --> 00:53.009
PUGA: You want Immigration

01:00.712 --> 01:03.106

I was given coordinates
to this place

01:03.150 --> 01:05.108
to find a Watcher.

01:06.675 --> 01:08.503
Yeah?

01:08.546 --> 01:10.244
I was told I had

01:10.287 --> 01:13.595
three days to stop

You're looking for a Supervisor,

02:17.137 --> 02:19.400
Laris, how did you get here?

02:19.443 --> 02:21.967
"Laris."
There's that name again.

02:22.011 --> 02:24.318
Did Q do this?

02:25.797 --> 02:27.843

Is that what you really want?

-You're not Laris.
-No.

Like others in my profession,

I have a singular purpose.

03:46.400 --> 03:48.228
[grunts]

03:48.271 --> 03:51.274
I have devoted
my entire being to protecting

one individual, a single string

03:53.842 --> 03:56.627
in a grand tapestry
to which I'm not privy.

03:56.671 --> 03:59.674
There is a divergence coming.

03:59.717 --> 04:03.417
Something that alters
the future I'm from.

you are protecting,

to that future.

04:12.948 --> 04:15.037

Interesting...

She taught herself
to be an expert sailor.

11:50.100 --> 11:52.799
Learned in the south of France,
where she grew up.

11:52.842 --> 11:54.409
That was by age ten.

11:54.452 --> 11:56.759
By age 11, it was chess,

11:56.803 --> 11:59.153
fluid dynamics, and Cantonese.

12:04.898 --> 12:07.509
Those were nail-biters.

12:07.552 --> 12:10.251

Sometimes anxiety,

12:25.048 --> 12:26.920
sometimes depression.

12:28.399 --> 12:30.445
It's a shame,

12:30.488 --> 12:32.882
for a mind that can burn
so brightly.

12:32.926 --> 12:36.451
Depression in a human

12:37.844 --> 12:41.195
She's... maybe lucky to survive.

12:41.238 --> 12:44.589

Fear does not have to be
your enemy, Renée.

I am a god.

14:52.065 --> 14:54.371
And as I look down at humanity,

14:54.415 --> 14:57.070
I see them at a crossroads.

14:57.113 --> 14:59.376
Will they evolve

14:59.420 --> 15:01.944
toward enlightenment,

15:01.988 --> 15:03.554
or will there be a divergence

15:03.598 --> 15:05.948
into darkness?

15:05.992 --> 15:08.864
KORE:
How'd it go, Dad? [sighs] Shit.

15:08.908 --> 15:10.257
That bad, huh?

15:10.300 --> 15:12.389
You didn't do the

15:12.433 --> 15:15.523
"humanity is at a crossroads"
thing? [chuckles]

15:15.566 --> 15:17.786
I did.

15:17.829 --> 15:19.788
Didn't take.

15:19.831 --> 15:22.095
Kore, my child,

15:22.138 --> 15:23.661
if I could encapsulate

15:23.705 --> 15:27.013
all the knowledge
I've gained through the years

15:27.056 --> 15:29.493
from life experience and

15:29.537 --> 15:31.669
careful study into a

15:31.713 --> 15:33.976
single pearl of wisdom for you,

15:34.020 --> 15:36.022
it would be this:

Picture a world

15:40.635 --> 15:42.593

15:45.335 --> 15:47.511
to nudge us
in the right direction,

15:47.555 --> 15:49.035
isn't that my responsibility?

15:51.298 --> 15:55.302
Someday soon, you'll get to
step into the outside world

15:55.345 --> 15:57.826

15:57.869 --> 15:59.175
I promise.

16:13.973 --> 16:16.453

Dr. Soong, I presume?

21:18.712 --> 21:22.629
Hacking into my network
was a cute little trick.

21:22.672 --> 21:25.284
So was teasing me with data

21:25.327 --> 21:27.503
that was mysteriously specific

21:27.547 --> 21:30.289
to the exact problem
I'm trying to solve.

21:30.332 --> 21:32.160
Oh, well, thank you,
I worked hard on that.

21:32.203 --> 21:33.640
Do you have any idea

21:33.683 --> 21:36.512
how many crackpots
contact me about my work?

21:36.556 --> 21:41.125
I get everything from
basement-dwelling Nazis to

to clone their fucking cats.

21:45.826 --> 21:47.349
Let me be clear,

21:47.393 --> 21:50.134
that's not what I do,
so don't waste my time.

21:50.178 --> 21:51.962
Oh, I wouldn't think of it.

21:52.006 --> 21:54.791

you're going to take a seat.

22:05.236 --> 22:06.803
How do I know?

22:06.847 --> 22:09.110
You drove an hour
to meet a total stranger,

22:09.153 --> 22:12.853
not for mystery
or intellectual curiosity,

22:12.896 --> 22:14.507
but because you're a father,

22:14.550 --> 22:17.074
and you're desperate.

22:22.863 --> 22:26.606
There. 17 seconds,
right on the tick. [chuckles]

22:28.434 --> 22:31.480
If you know that much about me,

22:31.524 --> 22:33.830
you know I'll kill you
if I think you're a threat.

22:33.874 --> 22:36.442
[chuckles] Yes, and
that's what I like about you.

22:36.485 --> 22:38.748
Who the hell are you?

22:38.792 --> 22:40.968
I am the

22:43.884 --> 22:47.714
I'm the gentle flutter

I am Death,

22:49.977 --> 22:52.240

22:54.460 --> 22:56.549
And I'm also a big fan
of your work.

22:56.592 --> 22:58.855
And a visionary who knows
how important you are

22:58.899 --> 23:00.988
to the future of this planet.

23:01.031 --> 23:02.381
What do you want?

23:08.996 --> 23:10.301
That's none of your concern.

23:10.345 --> 23:13.870
What a sad, sad irony.
A geneticist

an incurable genetic disease.

Sunlight burns like fire.

23:23.010 --> 23:26.143
Nothing... nothing is incurable.

23:26.187 --> 23:28.624
Well, you have neither the time
nor the funding

23:28.668 --> 23:30.452
to prove that theory, but...

23:30.496 --> 23:32.759
you do have this.

23:38.199 --> 23:40.506
Analyze it.
If you like what you see,

23:40.549 --> 23:42.290
give me a call.

23:42.333 --> 23:43.944
Then maybe

23:43.987 --> 23:46.642
you can help me with something
that I might want.

23:48.122 --> 23:50.080
TALLINN:
If Q is so all-powerful,

23:50.124 --> 23:52.300
why not just snap his fingers

23:52.343 --> 23:54.345
and make the Europa Mission
ship disappear?

23:54.389 --> 23:56.478
I don't know.

23:56.522 --> 23:58.437
Or even Renée herself?

23:58.480 --> 23:59.481
[scoffs] I don't know.

23:59.525 --> 24:01.396
But if he's trying

24:01.440 --> 24:04.181
to change the timeline
by manipulating Renée,

24:04.225 --> 24:06.532
then he's robbing her
of the destiny

24:06.575 --> 24:08.795
you were sworn to protect.

24:08.838 --> 24:10.405
TALLINN:
Okay. Tomorrow,

24:10.449 --> 24:12.581
she goes into
pre-launch quarantine.

24:12.625 --> 24:14.975
Once she does, it's...

24:15.018 --> 24:17.368
pretty impossible to back out.

24:17.412 --> 24:20.502
So, we need simply
to stop her from quitting

24:20.546 --> 24:22.809
for... next 15 hours.

24:24.550 --> 24:26.073
I don't suppose
you've any sedatives?

24:26.116 --> 24:28.162
[chuckles] We can't do that.

24:28.205 --> 24:29.642
She has to go
to the gala tonight.

24:29.685 --> 24:32.035
What gala?

24:32.079 --> 24:35.648
It's a-a big party before all
the astronauts go in quarantine.

24:35.691 --> 24:38.259
Attendance is mandatory.

24:38.302 --> 24:39.826
Lots of press.

24:39.869 --> 24:41.392
Meeting donors.

24:41.436 --> 24:44.526
So, we attend this gala,

24:44.570 --> 24:47.877
we cover Renée, we monitor
her state of mind,

24:47.921 --> 24:49.749
and isolate her
from potential threats.

24:49.792 --> 24:51.664
We should

24:51.707 --> 24:54.449
rendezvous with my crew.

24:54.493 --> 24:57.539
They may have gear on the ship.

24:57.583 --> 24:59.541
I think you're mistaking me
for someone

24:59.585 --> 25:01.151
who takes orders from you.

I know you protected her

25:03.763 --> 25:05.373
for 24 years,

25:05.416 --> 25:08.245
but you need to be strategic

25:08.289 --> 25:10.465
about this.

25:10.509 --> 25:12.336
We need to help each other.

I thought you'd be
running around the lab by now,

30:29.131 --> 30:30.872
having me help you
dissect and analyze

30:30.916 --> 30:32.569
every step that went into this.

30:32.613 --> 30:36.138
Don't be silly. I just want
to take the win for once.

But...

31:13.045 --> 31:15.743
I think I just killed
our only way home.

31:27.973 --> 31:30.105
I had to do it.

31:30.149 --> 31:32.194
She was killing him.

31:32.238 --> 31:34.936
He's all right now. I repaired
most of the internal organs.

31:34.980 --> 31:36.459
Most?

31:36.503 --> 31:38.026
Yeah, his spleen's in a box
over there.

31:43.684 --> 31:46.165
I hated shooting her.

31:46.208 --> 31:48.645
Organic tissue at the base
of the cerebellum.

31:48.689 --> 31:50.430
That's all it took.

31:50.473 --> 31:52.258
She's as vulnerable as we are.

31:52.301 --> 31:54.303
There are a few billion
souls who might

31:54.347 --> 31:55.739
disagree with you there.

32:00.222 --> 32:02.311
JURATI:
I gave him something
to erase the memory,

32:02.355 --> 32:04.574
but we need to get him
to his car.

32:08.404 --> 32:10.145
Tell me about the others.

32:10.189 --> 32:11.842
Can they be trusted?

32:11.886 --> 32:13.322
Oh, no question.

32:13.366 --> 32:15.063
We've been through
thick and thin together.

32:15.107 --> 32:17.326
There is no better bunch of...

32:17.370 --> 32:19.372

you're twisting his back.
-RIOS: It's okay.

32:19.415 --> 32:21.548
Is that your crew?

32:21.591 --> 32:25.204
The people carrying a dead cop
out the door.

32:25.247 --> 32:28.468
Oh, I-I'm sure he's not dead.

32:28.511 --> 32:30.557
There's got to be
some explanation.

32:30.600 --> 32:32.472
Come.

32:41.698 --> 32:43.483
Do you have the cure?

32:43.526 --> 32:45.528
The real cure?

32:45.572 --> 32:48.662
Not something that wears off.

32:48.705 --> 32:53.319
Because if you do,
I am a hostage to you, sir.

32:53.362 --> 32:56.017
We're all hostages
to what we love.

32:56.061 --> 32:59.455
The only way to truly be free
is to love nothing.

32:59.499 --> 33:02.284
How meaningless would that be?

33:02.328 --> 33:04.156
I have what she needs.

33:09.422 --> 33:11.119
What do you need?

33:13.078 --> 33:15.341
I have discovered of late

33:15.384 --> 33:18.170
that I have certain limitations.

33:18.213 --> 33:23.958
So I want you to remove
an obstacle for us.

33:24.002 --> 33:27.483
Does the name "Picard"
mean anything to you?

33:31.400 --> 33:33.315
I-I know you said
it was complicated,

33:33.359 --> 33:35.056
-but are we gonna talk
about your new...
-Not now.

33:35.100 --> 33:37.232
-No, but she looks
exactly like...
-I'm aware.

33:37.276 --> 33:39.626
-Well, doesn't that make you
feel a little, kind of creep...
-Yes.

33:39.669 --> 33:41.584
Good talk.

33:41.628 --> 33:44.848
What would it look like if you
were to leave the mission?

33:46.807 --> 33:48.765
Let's visualize.

33:49.723 --> 33:50.985
What is Q playing at?

33:51.029 --> 33:53.335
Well, there is now

33:53.379 --> 33:55.946
a very real danger
of Renee Picard

33:55.990 --> 33:58.079
backing out of this mission.

33:58.123 --> 34:02.475
And I think
what we experienced firsthand

34:02.518 --> 34:05.086
was the consequences of that.

34:05.130 --> 34:06.522
The other timeline.

34:06.566 --> 34:08.394
So no Europa mission,

34:08.437 --> 34:11.092
no Renee, no hope.

34:11.136 --> 34:12.963
Everyone hates everyone.

34:13.007 --> 34:14.052
You're saying
this great aunt of yours

34:14.095 --> 34:15.401
is single-handedly responsible

34:15.444 --> 34:16.880
for preventing our future

34:16.924 --> 34:20.188
from becoming
a xenophobic tyranny?

34:20.232 --> 34:22.364
-How?
-I don't know.

34:22.408 --> 34:24.801
The history of this time period

34:24.845 --> 34:27.804
is wildly incomplete.

34:27.848 --> 34:30.807
Uh, the century leading up
to first contact

34:30.851 --> 34:33.767
was just rife with chaos.

34:33.810 --> 34:36.161
All that's known about Renee
is she discovered

34:36.204 --> 34:39.773
a microorganism on Io
that she believed was sentient

34:39.816 --> 34:41.166
and convinced
the mission commander

34:41.209 --> 34:42.558
to bring it back to Earth.

34:42.602 --> 34:44.299
RAFFI:
And none of that would matter

34:44.343 --> 34:47.128
if Q was able to get to Renee
and break the timeline.

34:47.172 --> 34:48.869
RIOS:
Okay, so, we just
need to make sure

34:48.912 --> 34:51.219
Renee gets on that ship.

34:51.263 --> 34:52.916
PICARD:
We are going to monitor

34:52.960 --> 34:57.356

at this gala,

34:57.399 --> 34:59.967
assess the threats
and guide her.

35:00.010 --> 35:01.490
With an invisible hand.

35:02.970 --> 35:05.451
We don't reveal ourselves
or make contact.

35:05.494 --> 35:10.717
It might feel like Q
is playing with us,

35:10.760 --> 35:14.460
but he is unpredictable,
and a threat.

35:16.723 --> 35:19.117
Renee will be out in the open.

35:21.249 --> 35:22.642
We have another problem.

35:23.817 --> 35:25.035
We weren't invited.

35:25.079 --> 35:26.602
Can't we transport in?

35:26.646 --> 35:28.038
Well, it's not that simple.

35:29.301 --> 35:31.651
This is a maximum
security function.

35:31.694 --> 35:33.870

-Hi, there.

35:36.046 --> 35:37.831
...that corresponds
to a database

35:37.874 --> 35:41.182

35:41.226 --> 35:44.229
My technology can force
one person through,

35:44.272 --> 35:46.318
but only temporarily.

35:46.361 --> 35:48.929
Once inside,
facial recognition takes over.

35:50.583 --> 35:54.108
So even if we could
materialize six people

35:54.152 --> 35:55.718
in the middle
of the dance floor,

35:55.762 --> 35:57.894
we'd be busted immediately.

35:57.938 --> 36:02.029
We can't transport in
if we're not in the database.

36:02.072 --> 36:04.249
So we hack the database.
It'll take me two seconds.

It's primitive but effective.
That was in my class.

So we can't hack it
until we get inside.
