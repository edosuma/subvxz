thought after I graduated,

00:06.072 --> 00:08.475
{\an8}I wouldn't have to deal
with petty BS anymore.

00:08.541 --> 00:10.510
{\an8}But when your friends
end up being traders,

00:10.577 --> 00:12.011
{\an8}what can you expect?

00:12.078 --> 00:16.116
{\an8}- You are surrounding yourself
with people that are using you.

00:16.181 --> 00:18.618
- JULIETTE: I blame it on Chloe
and Alex being friends again.

00:18.685 --> 00:20.820
- I was telling Alex
all about Juliette.

00:20.887 --> 00:23.490
Alex was like not happy
about the Robby stuff.

00:23.556 --> 00:25.091

finally just lost it.

00:25.158 --> 00:26.693

00:35.535 --> 00:37.704
{\an8}But I'm not the only one who's
been rolling with the punches.

00:37.771 --> 00:39.606
{\an8}- We've been trying to work
it out, and it's not working.

00:39.672 --> 00:41.708
So maybe a break
is what we need.

00:41.775 --> 00:44.077
- JULIETTE: In my opinion, a
break isn't going to end well.

00:44.144 --> 00:46.446
- Well, how do you feel about
hooking up

00:46.513 --> 00:47.747
with other people then?

00:47.814 --> 00:48.948

least for Garrett.

00:50.717 --> 00:52.519
{\an8}- JULIETTE: And while
some of us are breaking up.

00:52.585 --> 00:53.987
{\an8}- I love you.

00:54.053 --> 00:55.722

to have found the real thing.

00:55.789 --> 00:56.956
- I love you, too.

00:57.023 --> 00:58.391

everyone is supportive.

00:58.458 --> 00:59.459
- How the heck old are ya?

00:59.526 --> 01:00.593

01:00.660 --> 01:02.762
- I think it's a mistake.

01:02.829 --> 01:04.263

make matters even worse.

01:04.330 --> 01:05.765
- Hey, don't cry.

01:05.832 --> 01:07.300
- JULIETTE: Madisson and Ish are
doing the long-distance thing.

01:07.367 --> 01:08.601
- I don't want you to leave.

01:08.668 --> 01:10.069

trying to cause problems

01:10.136 --> 01:11.538

jealous, which I totally get.

01:17.811 --> 01:19.379
- Yah!
- There you go.

01:19.446 --> 01:20.280

feelings

01:20.346 --> 01:21.481
can really screw things up.
