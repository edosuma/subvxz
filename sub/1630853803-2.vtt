00:10.219 --> 00:12.596
<i>Sophie, are you ready to begin?</i>

00:24.525 --> 00:26.443
<i>Now, take me back.</i>

00:38.080 --> 00:40.582
<i>You're getting to know your life,</i>

00:41.583 --> 00:45.587
<i>your family, your husband.</i>

00:47.923 --> 00:49.716
<i>Now the basics.</i>

00:55.514 --> 00:57.891
<i>Coming home for the first time.</i>

01:13.156 --> 01:15.993
Hey. Let me take that.

01:16.076 --> 01:18.036
<i>Where were you before?</i>

01:18.120 --> 01:19.830
Look at me. It's okay.

01:19.913 --> 01:22.291
Okay. Look at me.

01:22.374 --> 01:25.127
It's okay.

01:25.669 --> 01:27.129
You were in a coma.

01:27.796 --> 01:30.424
Your name is Sophie Ellis.

01:32.009 --> 01:33.969
<i>And before that?</i>

01:37.472 --> 01:40.017
- Excuse me, are you Mr. Ellis?
- Yeah.

01:41.393 --> 01:43.020
Is she gonna be okay?

01:43.103 --> 01:45.647
- Are you her husband?
- Yeah, I'm her fucking husband.

01:47.232 --> 01:49.651
<i>Try to remember getting to the hospital.</i>

01:52.154 --> 01:53.405
Why didn't we take her to County?

01:53.488 --> 01:55.115
Did you see the shirt I just cut off her?

01:55.199 --> 01:56.575
Costs more than me and you make in a week.

01:56.658 --> 01:58.285
Fucking bored rich people.

01:58.869 --> 02:00.454
<i>The rescue.</i>

02:05.667 --> 02:07.878
<i>And the water.</i>

02:21.099 --> 02:22.851
<i>You're falling.</i>

02:25.395 --> 02:27.189
You're falling.

02:28.023 --> 02:29.566
<i>Can you keep going?</i>

02:30.234 --> 02:31.902
<i>Get back on that boat, Sophie.</i>

02:34.696 --> 02:35.822
Stay in it.

03:48.395 --> 03:49.813
What did you see?

03:51.190 --> 03:54.526
There was a man on the ferry.

03:56.528 --> 03:57.905
Where on the ferry?

04:00.949 --> 04:01.950
On the edge.

04:06.205 --> 04:08.665
And what does seeing that man mean to you?

04:10.584 --> 04:14.880
That maybe I didn't jump.

04:17.048 --> 04:21.762
Maybe… I was pushed.

04:23.972 --> 04:26.225
I'd like to be honest with you, Sophie.

04:26.308 --> 04:28.810
- Is that all right?
- Of course.

04:29.311 --> 04:30.521
The reason I'm asking is,

04:30.604 --> 04:34.274
I don't think you're going to like
what I have to say.

04:36.360 --> 04:40.113
I can't help but wonder if the man you saw

04:40.197 --> 04:43.951
is just a manifestation
of your subconscious.

04:44.034 --> 04:48.497
Another way to avoid taking responsibility
for your own actions.

04:48.580 --> 04:52.584
I think it's hard to take responsibility
for a decision you don't remember making.

04:53.085 --> 04:54.461
I know it is,

04:55.087 --> 04:59.424
but continuing
to deny your own agency in this…

05:00.717 --> 05:02.761
It only disempowers you.

05:04.096 --> 05:05.639
I saw him.

05:05.722 --> 05:08.517
This wasn't some figment
of my imagination.

05:09.518 --> 05:12.688
Isn't there something else we can try?
Some experimental treatment

05:12.771 --> 05:15.566
- or new therapy? Something more extreme.
- I'm sorry, Sophie.

05:15.649 --> 05:20.028
There are no shortcuts,
no magic pill that's gonna fix this.

05:20.112 --> 05:23.490
And any clinician
that tells you otherwise is a hack.

05:24.449 --> 05:29.663
Okay, then what do you think
my subconscious is trying to tell me?

05:31.623 --> 05:33.333
Let's say you're right.

05:34.168 --> 05:36.670
A man pushed you from the ferry.

05:37.546 --> 05:41.008
Who exactly do you think that man is?

05:57.983 --> 06:01.236
I did a hypnotherapy session
with Hannah yesterday.

06:02.237 --> 06:03.280
Really?

06:04.990 --> 06:06.617
That doesn't seem like you.

06:07.993 --> 06:09.411
Actually, it was my idea.

06:10.954 --> 06:14.875
Revisiting the accident's supposed
to help me process my trauma.

06:17.294 --> 06:18.420
What?

06:19.004 --> 06:21.965
I mean, I just--
I thought we were past this.

06:22.049 --> 06:25.219
I don't understand why you keep
putting yourself through it, is all.

06:27.471 --> 06:29.431
I mean, is it-- is it working?

06:31.058 --> 06:33.810
Bringing up more questions than answers.

06:35.229 --> 06:36.647
You have questions for me?

06:42.110 --> 06:43.362
Go ahead.

06:44.780 --> 06:46.406
Go ahead. I want to help.

06:48.575 --> 06:49.785
Okay.

06:52.120 --> 06:53.997
How long was I in the ICU?

06:54.831 --> 06:55.874
Three weeks.

06:58.043 --> 06:59.753
Okay, I was there every day.

07:01.797 --> 07:04.049
Where were you when I woke up
in the hospital?

07:04.132 --> 07:05.926
Well, the nurse sent me home to shower.

07:06.635 --> 07:09.847
I was halfway there when they called
and said you'd woken up.

07:12.057 --> 07:13.892
I ran a red light trying
to get back to you.

07:14.643 --> 07:16.728
Nearly crashed the car, actually.

07:16.812 --> 07:19.940
- Sorry.
- No, please. Keep going.

07:22.651 --> 07:26.530
What were you doing in Portland
the day of the accident?

07:26.613 --> 07:28.031
What?

07:28.115 --> 07:30.158
Was it a business trip or--

07:30.242 --> 07:34.121
No, it was a conference.
Yeah, I go every year.

07:37.249 --> 07:40.127
What does my conference have
to do with your accident?

07:41.587 --> 07:44.214
Just putting the pieces together.

07:46.884 --> 07:48.719
I know it sounds random,

07:48.802 --> 07:52.764
but every little bit
gets me closer to being whole.

07:58.520 --> 08:02.232
Well, like I said,

08:03.150 --> 08:05.110
I'm here to help, okay?

08:11.491 --> 08:12.576
I better get going.

08:16.121 --> 08:17.789
- See you tonight for dinner?
- Yeah.

09:07.422 --> 09:10.634
Gloria. How you doing?
When's that surgery?

09:10.717 --> 09:12.678
Stupid doctor postponed it a week.

09:12.761 --> 09:15.305
You got a haircut.
It must be a new girl, huh?

09:16.890 --> 09:19.142
To-go order. Three bean baleadas.

09:19.226 --> 09:20.227
Got it.

09:21.353 --> 09:23.438
Julio. Julio. Julio.

09:23.522 --> 09:26.608
If this is about what I said to your boss,
I was just joking.

09:26.692 --> 09:28.443
Don't even worry about it, man.
It's all good.

09:29.027 --> 09:30.028
Okay.

09:30.112 --> 09:32.364
But I am gonna need a favor
from you though,

09:32.447 --> 09:33.782
from your other job.

09:35.826 --> 09:38.537
- Look, man, I don't want any trouble.
- Then you won't get any.

09:40.622 --> 09:44.251
I really need that job.
I make good tips over there.

09:45.169 --> 09:46.628
Did I say I was asking?

10:17.993 --> 10:19.912
- James Ellis's office.
-<i>Hi, Victoria.</i>

10:19.995 --> 10:21.205
It's Sophie.

10:21.705 --> 10:23.624
I am so sorry to bug you with this,

10:23.707 --> 10:26.668
but I was just going through
all of our travel receipts,

10:26.752 --> 10:28.712
and I seem to be missing some.

10:29.671 --> 10:31.882
Hold on. Let me check.

10:34.801 --> 10:37.137
Right, that's it. Portland.

10:37.846 --> 10:40.098
I think it was four or five months ago.

10:40.766 --> 10:43.435
I really don't want
to bother James with this.

10:43.519 --> 10:46.813
-<i>He's got so much on his plate.</i>
- Doesn't ring a bell.

10:48.649 --> 10:51.109
I think it was a conference?

10:52.486 --> 10:56.490
I forget the name,
but he said he goes every year.

10:56.573 --> 10:57.783
Maybe you have it?

10:58.992 --> 11:00.702
<i>Weird. Nothing's coming up.</i>

11:01.453 --> 11:03.288
<i>He might have used his personal Amex.</i>

11:03.789 --> 11:06.375
<i>You can ask him yourself.
He just walked out of a meeting.</i>

11:06.458 --> 11:08.085
- It's okay, I don't need to--
- Sophie.

11:08.961 --> 11:10.337
Hey, Soph. What's up?

11:12.339 --> 11:13.549
<i>Babe?</i>

11:14.216 --> 11:15.217
You know what,

11:15.300 --> 11:17.261
I think I just found
what I was looking for.

11:18.262 --> 11:19.471
<i>You sure?</i>

11:20.305 --> 11:24.226
Hey, you want to get takeout
from that Korean place on Geary tonight?

11:25.143 --> 11:26.979
Yeah. That sounds good.

11:27.062 --> 11:28.188
<i>I'll call in the order.</i>

11:28.689 --> 11:30.274
Okay, see you soon.

11:30.357 --> 11:31.567
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

12:27.164 --> 12:28.457
You look nice today.

12:30.501 --> 12:31.752
Thanks.

12:35.130 --> 12:38.467
I've been meaning to get some new things

12:38.550 --> 12:40.719
now that I'm getting out
of the house more, you know.

12:42.095 --> 12:46.433
I tried
to buy something online today, actually.

12:46.517 --> 12:49.019
Well, I mean, I can take you
shopping any time you want.

12:54.983 --> 12:57.736
I was locked out of the accounts.

12:58.987 --> 13:01.990
Amex, Chase, everything.

13:09.498 --> 13:11.083
Look-- I've…

13:12.459 --> 13:14.002
I've been meaning to tell you.

13:14.711 --> 13:18.340
I guess I just didn't really know how.

13:20.092 --> 13:21.343
Tell me what?

13:23.846 --> 13:25.973
After your accident…

13:28.976 --> 13:31.270
I had to file for conservatorship.

13:35.691 --> 13:37.359
And doctors, they all said the same thing.

13:37.442 --> 13:40.362
It's a standard procedure
in a situation like ours.

13:43.365 --> 13:45.951
And what kind of situation is that?

13:46.493 --> 13:51.039
Sophie, you weren't capable
of making decisions on your own.

13:52.207 --> 13:55.419
Medical, financial, or stuff like that.

13:59.423 --> 14:00.799
I was trying to do the right thing.

14:00.883 --> 14:03.677
It's not always so fucking clear
what that is these days.

14:04.636 --> 14:05.762
I know.

14:05.846 --> 14:07.848
But I'm better now.

14:11.059 --> 14:13.145
Do you still think it's necessary?

14:15.689 --> 14:17.774
It's not easy to unravel.

14:19.151 --> 14:21.987
I mean, lawyers have to get involved.
The whole thing, it's--

14:22.070 --> 14:23.113
It's a mess.

14:27.743 --> 14:30.245
But if it's important to you…

14:33.582 --> 14:35.375
then we'll figure something out.

14:35.459 --> 14:36.418
Okay?

14:42.341 --> 14:43.342
Good.

14:47.846 --> 14:49.890
I wait at the same light,

14:49.973 --> 14:53.560
make the same right turn every single day.

14:55.562 --> 14:59.983
Sometimes I just feel like
I'm running in circles.

15:00.067 --> 15:02.361
That sounds more honest.

15:02.444 --> 15:05.906
I thought about what you said,
looking inward.

15:07.491 --> 15:10.410
I've really been trying hard to do that.

15:11.662 --> 15:13.705
I just want to feel like I belong.

15:15.207 --> 15:16.917
I second-guess every decision I make

15:17.000 --> 15:19.127
wondering if it's what the old me
would do.

15:23.090 --> 15:25.259
Maybe I just need a change of scenery.

15:26.093 --> 15:28.846
This whole fucking city's
surrounded by water.

15:31.932 --> 15:35.060
Well, here's a thought.
Why don't you get out of the city?

15:35.644 --> 15:38.814
You and James get away. Break the routine.

15:42.234 --> 15:43.151
I'd love that.

15:43.235 --> 15:47.030
In my professional opinion,
it'll be good for both of you.

15:55.998 --> 15:57.291
I saw Hannah today.

15:58.750 --> 16:00.002
It was good.

16:00.085 --> 16:02.045
She had some really good ideas.

16:03.672 --> 16:07.176
I don't think I've ever heard you
describe a session as good before.

16:07.259 --> 16:10.637
I feel like I've been
stuck in a rut lately.

16:12.222 --> 16:16.977
My whole life basically takes place
in this house or in therapy.

16:18.854 --> 16:21.815
I didn't realize you felt so isolated.

16:22.816 --> 16:25.903
- I wish you would've told me.
- You already do so much for me.

16:26.737 --> 16:29.615
I just feel like we're both tired,
you know?

16:32.659 --> 16:36.496
Hannah thought a change of scenery
might be good for me.

16:37.789 --> 16:41.001
She suggested I take a break,
get out of town.

16:41.585 --> 16:44.338
I thought I might do
a girls' trip with Caroline.

16:45.088 --> 16:46.256
Just an overnight thing.

16:48.675 --> 16:50.636
She said a break
would be good for you too.

16:58.685 --> 17:02.773
I mean, you haven't spent
a night away from home since the accident.

17:03.273 --> 17:06.318
Hannah says I'm making progress,

17:07.109 --> 17:10.364
and you have no idea how hard it is
to get a compliment from her.

17:13.700 --> 17:17.663
Well, what about our vacation home
in Marin?

17:18.579 --> 17:22.084
You always liked it there.
It's quiet and secluded.

17:23.502 --> 17:24.586
It sounds perfect.

17:25.878 --> 17:27.089
You know me so well.

17:38.058 --> 17:39.726
Oh, fuck.

17:40.978 --> 17:42.563
You'll have to go over the bridge.

17:48.485 --> 17:49.528
It's worth it.

17:51.113 --> 17:53.198
I have to face my fears someday, right?

18:04.084 --> 18:05.377
Would you rather fresh air?

18:06.170 --> 18:07.421
No, this is good.

18:10.674 --> 18:13.594
Are you sure you want to do this?
'Cause I'll be just as happy staying here.

18:13.927 --> 18:17.055
- I'm good. Promise.
- Okay.

18:17.139 --> 18:20.434
Well, just so you know,
I've engaged the safety locks

18:20.517 --> 18:23.395
just in case we decide
to have a little repeat performance today.

18:25.063 --> 18:27.024
If me jumping out of a cab on the freeway

18:27.107 --> 18:29.860
is the worst thing that driver's seen
in San Francisco,

18:29.943 --> 18:31.320
he hasn't driven long enough.

18:38.619 --> 18:39.661
Breathe.

18:42.456 --> 18:43.874
Just breathe.

18:53.550 --> 18:55.052
You are not serious.

19:02.184 --> 19:03.310
Oh, yeah, I'm serious.

19:03.393 --> 19:05.854
And you better not
fucking leave me hanging.

19:30.420 --> 19:31.463
Oh, my God.

19:33.841 --> 19:35.717
- Doing real good.
- Thanks.

20:01.285 --> 20:03.287
<i>You've reached Sophie Ellis.
Leave a message.</i>

20:55.714 --> 20:56.882
- Morning, sir.
- Thanks.

21:11.313 --> 21:12.564
You're late.

21:12.648 --> 21:14.274
And you are hungover.

21:15.400 --> 21:17.945
Ouch. Okay. We're touchy today, huh?

21:19.154 --> 21:20.906
- Sophie good?
- Yep.

21:20.989 --> 21:23.075
She left for Marin this morning
with Caroline.

21:23.575 --> 21:25.911
Wait, what?
Sophie went to Marin without you?

21:25.994 --> 21:28.914
Yeah. Her therapist thought
it'd be good for her, for us.

21:29.873 --> 21:33.085
Well, fuck yeah. Doctor's right, man.
No, no, you deserve a break.

21:33.168 --> 21:34.878
You've been at her beck and call
for months now.

21:34.962 --> 21:36.296
Well, she's my wife.

21:37.256 --> 21:39.383
Well, may not be my place to say, but

21:39.466 --> 21:42.177
you've always been better to her
than she ever was to you, so…

21:42.261 --> 21:45.430
You're right. It's not your place to say.

21:46.014 --> 21:47.766
Oh, fuck. I'm sorry.

21:47.850 --> 21:50.143
Just let me make it up to you.
Tonight. First round on me.

21:50.227 --> 21:53.355
That disgusting Scotch you like
that tastes like the bottom of a bonfire.

21:53.438 --> 21:55.148
- We're getting that?
- No, thanks.

21:55.232 --> 21:56.984
Come on. I know you're psyched
to have the night off.

21:57.067 --> 21:59.611
You're not staying home.
I'm not taking no for an answer!

22:10.747 --> 22:12.541
It's so beautiful.

22:17.212 --> 22:19.256
Hey, are there stables around here?

22:21.216 --> 22:22.509
Yeah, probably.

22:23.302 --> 22:25.095
Maybe we should go riding later.

22:26.972 --> 22:28.015
On a horse?

22:30.058 --> 22:32.561
Is that not… something we do?

22:34.855 --> 22:37.149
You and me, on horses?

22:38.525 --> 22:39.526
No.

22:39.610 --> 22:43.488
We're more like,
the sit by the pool, drink rosé,

22:43.572 --> 22:45.407
don't get the blowouts wet
kind of friends.

22:45.490 --> 22:47.117
That's why I like you.

22:52.372 --> 22:54.041
Welcome home, buttercup.

23:07.846 --> 23:10.349
I'm sorry. You need the code.

23:11.141 --> 23:15.479
Code is… "2448."

23:30.786 --> 23:31.828
Well?

23:33.205 --> 23:34.289
What do you think?

23:34.831 --> 23:35.832
I love it.

23:36.917 --> 23:38.919
Good. You always did.

23:44.508 --> 23:46.301
Did I come here a lot?

23:46.385 --> 23:47.427
Yeah.

23:48.136 --> 23:49.513
Mostly by yourself.

23:51.598 --> 23:55.185
Said you could hear yourself think here.

23:56.436 --> 23:59.314
Oh, my God. These nouveau riche types.

23:59.398 --> 24:02.484
They keep coming to the gallery
looking for obscure art.

24:03.819 --> 24:06.780
Who knew selling art
meant exclusively talking to people

24:06.864 --> 24:08.490
who know nothing about art?

24:13.203 --> 24:14.538
Okay.

24:14.621 --> 24:19.168
I have to finish this deal.
It shouldn't take more than an hour.

24:19.668 --> 24:22.212
Do you mind? And then I'm all yours.

24:22.713 --> 24:23.922
It's no problem.

24:24.006 --> 24:25.632
I wanted to take a walk anyway.

24:25.716 --> 24:27.092
Okay, good.

24:27.176 --> 24:28.218
Enjoy.

25:05.589 --> 25:06.798
Are you here to ride?

25:10.052 --> 25:11.094
Yeah.

25:13.013 --> 25:15.224
You have a horse I can take out today?

25:15.307 --> 25:16.892
Yeah.

25:27.361 --> 25:28.362
Hi.

25:29.029 --> 25:30.697
Whenever you're ready.

25:50.384 --> 25:52.261
Hey, look, you're a pro.

25:58.809 --> 26:00.561
Come on, boy. Let's go.

26:47.274 --> 26:48.275
Tess!

27:44.623 --> 27:46.667
- Yes.
- Surprise.

27:48.252 --> 27:50.170
You know I hate surprises, right?

27:50.254 --> 27:52.548
Yeah, I don't recall you
hating box seats, though?

27:53.131 --> 27:55.843
- Wait, you got box seats?
- Warriors, Lakers, baby.

27:56.510 --> 27:58.136
Steph. Bron-Bron.

27:58.804 --> 28:00.389
You owe me big fucking time, man.

28:00.472 --> 28:01.515
Fuck.

28:02.641 --> 28:04.852
I haven't been anywhere in months.

28:04.935 --> 28:05.978
Yeah. Exactly.

28:08.313 --> 28:10.023
I was… just doing some work.

28:10.774 --> 28:12.150
Of course you were.

28:13.026 --> 28:15.988
Will you just go put on some real clothes?
We're going out.

28:47.603 --> 28:48.604
Is that everything?

28:49.188 --> 28:53.525
It's all there.
GPS coordinates, dates, times.

28:53.609 --> 28:55.485
Everywhere he's been
for the last six months.

28:59.615 --> 29:03.368
Hey, I put a little extra in there
for your mom's surgery.

29:04.828 --> 29:06.288
Make sure she gets it, all right?

29:32.981 --> 29:33.982
Sophie?

29:35.317 --> 29:37.653
Oh, my God. Thank God!
Where have you been?

29:38.862 --> 29:41.490
I just-- I lost track of time.

29:42.908 --> 29:46.203
What's going on? Are you okay?

29:49.540 --> 29:50.541
I rode a horse.

29:53.877 --> 29:56.213
Like, you just decided to ride a horse?

29:57.464 --> 29:59.174
I think I might have done it before.

30:00.217 --> 30:01.677
Do you think that's possible?

30:02.678 --> 30:04.513
I don't know. Do you?

30:07.307 --> 30:11.061
Sometimes I have these dreams.
Maybe they're not dreams.

30:11.687 --> 30:12.688
I don't know.

30:15.065 --> 30:17.192
What else would they be?

30:20.654 --> 30:21.822
Memories?

30:27.035 --> 30:30.998
- Please don't be upset with me.
- Oh, no. God, I'm not upset with you.

30:31.081 --> 30:33.125
I'm just so happy you're okay.

30:34.334 --> 30:35.335
I'm fine.

30:36.420 --> 30:39.256
Look, let's just forget about it
and have a drink.

30:39.339 --> 30:42.217
- Please?
- Guess who found the wine cellar?

30:59.151 --> 31:01.278
Nice! We're up by three.

31:02.029 --> 31:03.030
Yeah.

31:04.198 --> 31:06.742
I paid, like, $1,600 for this box.

31:07.910 --> 31:10.829
James fucking Wiseman
is on pace for a triple-double.

31:10.913 --> 31:13.665
But I guess your phone is just
way more interesting.

31:13.749 --> 31:14.750
What are you eating?

31:15.501 --> 31:19.004
There's like a butler
with a whole cart of desserts out there.

31:21.965 --> 31:23.800
Oh, come on! Are you serious?

31:26.345 --> 31:28.764
Hey, what happened to no phones?

31:29.431 --> 31:31.183
Shut up. It's from the office.

31:32.768 --> 31:35.771
Wow, looks like it was
sent to all the partners.

31:36.730 --> 31:37.731
What about?

31:40.359 --> 31:43.487
Internal auditing department
has found a major discrepancy.

31:44.154 --> 31:47.908
Big chunk of the firm's money went out,
and now it's unaccounted for.

31:50.118 --> 31:51.620
Wait, that doesn't make sense.

31:51.703 --> 31:53.789
We've received
the quarterly financial statements

31:53.872 --> 31:55.958
from every company we've invested
in this year.

31:56.041 --> 31:58.961
But investments reported
don't match our books.

31:59.044 --> 32:00.420
Total's off.

32:04.466 --> 32:05.801
By how much?

32:07.302 --> 32:08.303
Millions.

32:10.848 --> 32:13.392
They wanna see everybody
in the morning, for a meeting.

32:13.475 --> 32:14.476
Good.

32:15.352 --> 32:17.020
You know what?

32:17.771 --> 32:20.023
I bet it's one of fucking Todd's clients.

32:20.607 --> 32:22.901
Remember last time?
The guy's a fucking idiot.

32:25.988 --> 32:27.322
They'll figure it out.

32:27.781 --> 32:29.074
Oh, fuck!

32:32.995 --> 32:35.038
I feel awful saying it, but…

32:36.331 --> 32:39.251
I'm more relaxed here
than I've ever been with him.

32:41.503 --> 32:45.215
He has these… expectations.

32:45.299 --> 32:47.885
That I should
act the same way I did before.

32:48.886 --> 32:53.223
But I don't know who that is.
What she's like.

32:54.391 --> 32:57.769
So instead, I'm just
walking on eggshells the whole time.

32:57.853 --> 33:01.690
Yeah. I get it. I mean, sort of, you know.

33:01.773 --> 33:05.319
I can't spend a week with the same guy,
never mind five months.

33:05.402 --> 33:07.321
And a lifetime? Please.

33:09.615 --> 33:11.825
Can I ask you a question now?

33:13.744 --> 33:15.204
You're my best friend, right?

33:17.372 --> 33:19.291
Sophie, of course.

33:22.085 --> 33:25.672
So what was I really like? Before.

33:31.678 --> 33:33.305
You were interesting.

33:35.641 --> 33:39.895
You were skeptical and… complicated.

33:41.104 --> 33:42.105
Complicated?

33:42.189 --> 33:46.068
Well, you just didn't really
open up a lot.

33:46.860 --> 33:49.363
Like, you preferred
hearing other people's stories.

33:49.446 --> 33:53.283
I think it took me a year or two
before you really gave me the time of day.

33:55.953 --> 33:57.371
What?

33:59.039 --> 34:00.916
You are the one who's
supposed to know me best,

34:00.999 --> 34:03.544
and you're saying you didn't really
know me at all.

34:03.627 --> 34:08.715
No. That's not what I'm saying.
I'm… just saying, you didn't…

34:11.009 --> 34:12.678
talk about deep things.

34:13.387 --> 34:16.556
Your feelings. And neither did I.

34:16.639 --> 34:19.768
And… you know what?

34:21.645 --> 34:22.855
Maybe we should've.

34:30.529 --> 34:33.447
Sorry, I should just stop talking.

34:34.408 --> 34:36.577
No, I'm a big girl. I can handle it.

34:41.039 --> 34:42.040
Okay.

34:45.127 --> 34:46.628
What do you wanna know?

34:48.714 --> 34:49.715
Me and James.

34:51.466 --> 34:52.842
What was the connection?

34:53.385 --> 34:58.682
He was loyal and stable and devoted.

34:58.765 --> 35:03.896
And it seemed like those things
meant a lot to you.

35:08.025 --> 35:09.401
And our marriage?

35:12.613 --> 35:14.323
We were happy?

35:18.994 --> 35:20.746
No, I--

35:22.915 --> 35:25.959
I don't really know how to answer that.

35:28.295 --> 35:30.005
I must've said something.

35:30.088 --> 35:34.134
Yeah, n-- Your marriage was multifaceted.
It just had layers.

35:34.801 --> 35:37.721
Meaning, we had secrets?

35:37.804 --> 35:42.601
No. That's not what I'm saying.
Just… every marriage has issues.

35:42.684 --> 35:44.186
But you know something.

35:44.269 --> 35:47.147
No, I don't. You should ask him.

35:47.231 --> 35:48.690
I'm asking you.

35:52.778 --> 35:56.448
Well, you know, one time,
I thought that you were maybe

35:56.532 --> 35:57.950
seeing someone else.

35:58.033 --> 36:02.871
But, even if you did,
I wouldn't have judged you.

36:03.997 --> 36:05.582
We all make mistakes.

36:11.213 --> 36:13.715
Did James think I was
having an affair too?

36:13.799 --> 36:15.008
I have no idea.

36:15.092 --> 36:17.719
And even if I did, I never would have
discussed it with him.

36:17.803 --> 36:19.304
I was your friend.

36:24.393 --> 36:27.896
If he did know,
what would he have done about it?

36:31.316 --> 36:32.734
Listen, I…

36:35.362 --> 36:38.073
Okay, I never thought
that James was perfect.

36:38.991 --> 36:42.703
But I know he loves you.

36:44.955 --> 36:46.331
More than anything.

38:34.273 --> 38:35.607
How was it?

38:37.568 --> 38:38.569
We had fun.

38:40.195 --> 38:41.196
What about you?

38:43.156 --> 38:44.533
Honestly,

38:46.326 --> 38:48.245
the house felt very empty without you.

38:52.082 --> 38:53.375
So…

39:37.544 --> 39:38.795
Come on, James.

39:41.256 --> 39:43.258
Where the fuck are you?

39:51.225 --> 39:52.226
Not in Portland.

40:35.310 --> 40:36.436
- Caroline?
- Upstairs.

40:36.520 --> 40:37.521
Okay.

40:38.063 --> 40:41.275
No, you don't get it.
She's been acting weird, James.

40:41.984 --> 40:44.987
No, you're not listening.
She's remembering things.

40:46.655 --> 40:49.408
She's starting to
ask questions I can't answer.

40:50.826 --> 40:51.827
No.

40:54.371 --> 40:58.208
James, I'm telling you.
We have to get our stories straight here.

41:10.596 --> 41:11.763
Jesus.

41:11.847 --> 41:13.307
I told you to leave me alone.

41:15.434 --> 41:16.935
Look, it's not like that, okay?

41:17.019 --> 41:20.397
I saw you, camping outside my house.
Following me.

41:20.480 --> 41:23.275
I know. I wanted you
to know I was there, just in case.

41:30.365 --> 41:31.366
You were right.

41:33.869 --> 41:35.370
I can't trust anyone.

41:38.874 --> 41:41.043
Your husband's alibi is a lie.

41:42.336 --> 41:43.587
He was never in Portland.

41:45.088 --> 41:46.173
I know.

41:48.342 --> 41:49.801
Where the fuck was he?

41:53.347 --> 41:54.348
Come with me.

41:58.018 --> 41:59.645
I'll tell you everything I know.
