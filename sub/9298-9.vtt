Sync by Gatto, corrected by ilse

00:56.074 --> 00:57.909
No. No.

00:57.943 --> 00:59.243
No, no, no.

00:59.278 --> 01:01.679
- Did you forget?
- Oh, shoot.

01:01.713 --> 01:03.614
Maura, this crack-of-dawn
run was your idea.

01:03.649 --> 01:05.883
Damn it, I could have
slept in. I am so sorry.

01:05.918 --> 01:07.452
Hey, babe,
once you touch it,

01:07.486 --> 01:08.753
you got to do something
with it.

01:08.787 --> 01:10.254
"Babe"?

01:12.891 --> 01:14.826
What is Tommy doing
here so early?

01:14.860 --> 01:16.661
It's not early so much as late.

01:16.695 --> 01:18.162
He spent the night.

01:19.131 --> 01:21.899
Playing chess.
He's quite good.

01:21.934 --> 01:23.201
Sorry.

01:23.235 --> 01:25.670
Knight to b3.

01:25.704 --> 01:29.173
Mm. Declining the gambit.
Risky move.

01:29.208 --> 01:31.509
Morning, sis.

01:31.543 --> 01:32.777
I didn't realize you two
were so chummy.

01:32.811 --> 01:34.045
Oh, this isn't chummy.

01:34.079 --> 01:37.014
I've all but destroyed
his king's pawn defense.

01:37.049 --> 01:39.217
- Whatever.
- Mm. Good for you.

01:39.251 --> 01:40.918
Mom goes to Atlantic city
for a few days,

01:40.953 --> 01:42.620
and now you're sleeping over?

01:42.654 --> 01:45.256
Like she said, Jane,
we're just playing chess.

01:45.290 --> 01:47.992
Best opponent I ever faced.

01:48.026 --> 01:49.560
Stop.

01:53.065 --> 01:55.500
Rizzoli.

01:55.534 --> 01:57.702
Yeah, okay,
I'll be right there.

01:57.736 --> 01:59.070
Come on, we got
a possible homicide.

01:59.104 --> 02:00.805
- We got to go.
- I'm about to castle.

02:00.839 --> 02:02.840
And I...I haven't been
called in yet.

02:06.979 --> 02:09.045
Ah.

02:09.080 --> 02:10.448
Dr. Isles.

02:11.750 --> 02:13.885
No moves without me.

02:13.919 --> 02:16.220
No moves at all.

02:16.255 --> 02:18.189
Show yourself out.

02:18.223 --> 02:21.692
Do not sleep with my brother.

02:21.727 --> 02:23.027
What?!

02:23.061 --> 02:26.130
Jane, it hadn't even
occurred to me.

02:26.164 --> 02:29.000
Although he does have
exquisite long bones.

02:29.034 --> 02:31.569
"Long bones"? Eww!

02:31.603 --> 02:33.504
Femur, tibia.

02:33.539 --> 02:36.841
Look, it's his mind that I find
myself most attracted to.

02:36.875 --> 02:38.876
He barely graduated
high school.

02:38.911 --> 02:41.212
Well, Bobby Fischer
was a high-school dropout,

02:41.246 --> 02:43.180
and he's a world
chess champion.

02:43.215 --> 02:45.550
Well, okay,
so when Tommy becomes

02:45.584 --> 02:48.719
a world-class chess champion,
you can sleep with him.

02:48.754 --> 02:50.054
Really?

02:50.088 --> 02:51.589
No.

02:53.225 --> 02:55.593
Neighborhood thieves stripped
this baby clean last night.

02:55.627 --> 02:57.295
Didn't get around to calling us
about all the blood in it

02:57.329 --> 02:58.596
till an hour ago.

02:58.630 --> 02:59.964
What, they steal
the victim, too?

02:59.998 --> 03:02.099
<i>All we know is that
there was one.</i>

03:02.134 --> 03:03.734
Well, it's a good place
to dump a car

03:03.769 --> 03:05.469
if you're gonna kill
somebody in it.

03:05.504 --> 03:07.905
Two distinct patterns
of arterial spray.

03:07.940 --> 03:10.474
Both the victim's carotids
were severed.

03:10.509 --> 03:13.477
Whoever sat here
is most certainly dead.

03:13.512 --> 03:16.247
Without a body, we're gonna need
as much evidence as we can get.

03:16.281 --> 03:18.549
Uh, hey, officer,
spread the word that BPD

03:18.584 --> 03:20.585
will pay triple what any
pawn shop or fence will pay

03:20.619 --> 03:22.787
for anything stripped off
this car -- no questions asked.

03:22.821 --> 03:23.888
Okay.

03:23.922 --> 03:26.157
And, uh, anything
that gets turned in,

03:26.191 --> 03:27.558
homicide gets it first.

03:27.593 --> 03:30.628
It's Duncan, by the way.

03:30.662 --> 03:32.163
What?

03:32.197 --> 03:37.101
My name --
officer Ronald Duncan.

03:37.135 --> 03:39.070
Did I say something wrong?

03:39.104 --> 03:40.838
People just like
to be acknowledged, Jane.

03:40.872 --> 03:42.073
Which reminds me --

03:42.107 --> 03:43.774
- No.
- Jane?

03:43.809 --> 03:45.109
Sensitivity training
is mandatory

03:45.143 --> 03:46.777
for the entire department,

03:46.812 --> 03:48.179
and it's incumbent on me
to make sure that you attend.

03:48.213 --> 03:49.814
Look,
I don't want to pull rank.

03:49.848 --> 03:51.916
I'm in the middle of
a homicide investigation.

03:51.950 --> 03:54.151
I don't have time to go sit
with some emo-Nazi

03:54.186 --> 03:56.220
and have her tell me what I can
or cannot say

03:56.254 --> 03:57.955
to all the lowlifes
and scumbags

03:57.990 --> 03:59.890
and gangbangers
that I got to deal with.

03:59.925 --> 04:01.292
Nice.

04:01.326 --> 04:04.829
Uh, car belongs to a
Melissa Joy Black from Michigan.

04:04.863 --> 04:06.731
22 years old.

04:06.765 --> 04:08.265
Called Ann Arbor P.D.
No stolen-car report.

04:08.300 --> 04:10.134
They checked her phone there --
disconnected.

04:10.168 --> 04:13.070
Yeah, well, it's 'cause
she lives in Boston now.

04:13.105 --> 04:15.940
That's a current parking pass
at the local terminal.

04:15.974 --> 04:17.041
My guess is...

04:17.075 --> 04:18.942
Melissa Joy works at the docks.

04:18.976 --> 04:20.745
Secretary in one
of the offices, maybe?

04:20.779 --> 04:23.080
Well, now,
that's a very sexist remark

04:23.115 --> 04:25.016
coming from a guy who's
pitching sensitivity training.

04:25.050 --> 04:26.784
She's 5'2" working
at the docks.

04:26.818 --> 04:28.119
How's that sexist?

04:28.153 --> 04:30.755
Because a mesomorphic
woman of that height

04:30.789 --> 04:33.557
could easily lift two
times her body weight,

04:33.592 --> 04:35.159
detective Korsak.

04:35.193 --> 04:36.460
Frost, e-mail this to me?

04:36.495 --> 04:37.728
Hey, you want to process
the crime scene?

04:37.763 --> 04:38.929
I'm gonna go to the docks.

04:38.964 --> 04:40.131
See ya.

04:40.165 --> 04:41.599
You, of course,
are coming with me.

04:41.633 --> 04:43.167
Well, you know,
I'm beginning to think

04:43.201 --> 04:45.069
that you are deliberately
trying to take me

04:45.103 --> 04:46.737
away from my chess game.

04:46.772 --> 04:50.307
<i>Yes, Maura, I am sabotaging
your knight-to-queen castle</i>

04:50.342 --> 04:51.642
thingy move.

04:51.677 --> 04:55.179
<i>I drove you here.</i>

05:04.022 --> 05:07.658
Hey, babe.
Nice tits.

05:07.693 --> 05:09.627
Oh, yeah, we've been waiting
for you all our lives.

05:09.661 --> 05:11.162
What's he think we're gonna do?

05:11.196 --> 05:13.164
Just run over there
and tear off his clothes?

05:13.198 --> 05:15.032
He's not thinking
consciously at all.

05:15.067 --> 05:18.469
- It's a natural chemical response
to our pheromones. - Really?

05:18.503 --> 05:22.039
"Nice tits" is a natural
chemical response?

05:22.074 --> 05:24.575
Perceived fertility
is Paramount.

05:24.609 --> 05:26.944
Males seek mates capable
of nursing offspring.

05:26.978 --> 05:28.813
Abundant breasts
do suggest --

05:28.847 --> 05:31.248
Yeah, you know what
his abundant belly suggests?

05:31.283 --> 05:32.817
Snowball's chance in hell.

05:33.952 --> 05:36.287
Here -- The office is over here.

05:39.858 --> 05:41.092
Oh, hey, excuse me.

05:41.126 --> 05:43.694
Can you tell me
who's in charge here?

05:43.729 --> 05:44.795
Uh...He's busy.

05:44.830 --> 05:46.097
So am I.

05:46.131 --> 05:48.866
Boston Homicide.

05:50.001 --> 05:52.403
Hey, what can I do
for you lovely ladies?

05:52.437 --> 05:54.839
That's a doctor.
I'm a detective.

05:54.873 --> 05:56.107
And you are...?

05:56.141 --> 05:58.576
Ray Murphy. I'm the
Union rep around here.

05:58.610 --> 05:59.777
Is there a problem?

05:59.811 --> 06:01.746
Are you familiar
with this employee?

06:01.780 --> 06:03.080
Melissa Joy Black?

06:03.115 --> 06:05.082
Well, I can tell you

06:05.117 --> 06:06.951
she's not one of the
office girls.

06:06.985 --> 06:08.953
It appears every female here
is over the age of 18.

06:10.589 --> 06:12.490
Could she be a longshoreman?

06:12.524 --> 06:13.891
I guess she could be
one of the casual workers,

06:13.925 --> 06:15.693
but we don't have
many gi-- girls.

06:15.727 --> 06:17.661
Um, let me have you talk
to one of the Union bosses.

06:17.696 --> 06:20.831
Axl!

06:20.866 --> 06:23.000
This detective
needs to talk to you.

06:23.034 --> 06:25.035
You're a cop.
That's a turnoff.

06:25.070 --> 06:27.238
Bummer. Do you recognize her?

06:27.272 --> 06:28.939
M.J. Yeah.

06:28.974 --> 06:32.209
She walked off the job halfway
through her shift yesterday.

06:32.244 --> 06:35.079
Affirmative-action hires
are bullshit.

06:35.113 --> 06:36.981
No muscle, no use.

06:37.015 --> 06:39.116
Actually, male and female
muscle tissue is identical.

06:39.151 --> 06:41.252
What varies is the size
of the male skeletal frame.

06:41.286 --> 06:43.821
Men generally have
less body fat.

06:43.855 --> 06:45.756
But not always.

06:45.791 --> 06:47.024
What's going on?

06:47.058 --> 06:48.759
Call 911!

06:48.794 --> 06:52.196
Need some help!
Call 911!

07:01.239 --> 07:03.040
Tide started going out

07:03.074 --> 07:05.009
when one of the guys
noticed her.

07:05.043 --> 07:07.878
It's Melissa Joy Black.

07:07.913 --> 07:10.748
Is that --

07:10.782 --> 07:11.849
It's an ice pick, Jane.

07:11.883 --> 07:15.286
Doesn't mean he's back.

07:15.320 --> 07:17.855
Yes, it does.

07:21.739 --> 07:23.640
Paddy Doyle's signature --

07:23.674 --> 07:25.742
Ice pick through the heart
with a message attached.

07:25.776 --> 07:27.510
I guess he didn't
like e-mail.

07:27.545 --> 07:30.814
What kind of message
is he sending, though,

07:30.848 --> 07:33.149
with the murder of a 22-year-old
female dockworker?

07:33.184 --> 07:34.617
Whatever it is,
I won't be the one

07:34.652 --> 07:36.286
forensically interpreting it.

07:36.320 --> 07:39.856
I'm calling in Dr. Pike
from the Western Mass office.

07:39.890 --> 07:41.324
Oh, no, anybody but him.

07:41.358 --> 07:42.692
Don't know what's worse --

07:42.726 --> 07:44.727
his pompous attitude
or his O.C.D.

07:44.762 --> 07:47.197
That's very insensitive
language, sergeant Korsak.

07:47.231 --> 07:48.465
I'm sure language like that

07:48.499 --> 07:50.700
would really hurt
Dr. Pike's feelings.

07:52.002 --> 07:53.870
Come on, Maura.

07:53.904 --> 07:55.705
You don't have to do this.
All right?

07:55.739 --> 07:57.240
The only people who know
about your connection to Doyle

07:57.274 --> 07:58.408
are us and frost.

07:58.442 --> 07:59.676
We may finally be

07:59.710 --> 08:01.478
able to prosecute
Paddy Doyle for murder.

08:01.512 --> 08:02.779
I don't want to risk
a defense attorney finding out

08:02.813 --> 08:04.714
that he's my biological father

08:04.748 --> 08:06.616
and using it against us
in court.

08:06.650 --> 08:08.618
What are you gonna tell Pike?

08:08.652 --> 08:10.987
We don't have to tell him
anything. I'm his boss.

08:15.359 --> 08:16.826
Oh, my God.

08:16.861 --> 08:19.496
Bill Sutton, Mass Shore
Chief Executive Officer.

08:19.530 --> 08:20.830
Is there some way...

08:20.865 --> 08:22.365
Her body can be covered?

08:22.399 --> 08:25.702
It's, uh --
it's pretty upsetting.

08:30.674 --> 08:32.708
You say you're with Mass Shore?

08:32.743 --> 08:34.811
Yes, our company
runs the docks.

08:34.845 --> 08:37.179
Some people say
the mob still does.

08:37.214 --> 08:40.582
Well, uh, I know there's a long
history of that down here.

08:40.618 --> 08:41.784
Ever since we took
over last fall,

08:41.818 --> 08:43.419
we've taken steps
to change that.

08:43.453 --> 08:45.421
Don't think Paddy Doyle's
taken too kindly to that.

08:45.456 --> 08:47.423
You don't think he had anything
to do with this, do you?

08:47.458 --> 08:48.958
A dockworker is tied
to the piling

08:48.993 --> 08:50.760
with an ice pick
sticking out of her chest

08:50.794 --> 08:52.228
for everybody here to see?

08:52.263 --> 08:54.430
Yeah, we think
there may be a connection.

08:54.465 --> 08:56.599
Mr. Sutton, have you
or anybody at your company

08:56.634 --> 08:59.369
received any graft demands
or extortion threats

08:59.403 --> 09:01.237
- since you took over?
- No.

09:01.272 --> 09:02.672
Our corporation doesn't have
any ties to the mob.

09:02.706 --> 09:04.274
They do.

09:04.308 --> 09:07.877
And by "they"
you mean the dockworkers.

09:07.912 --> 09:09.279
Look, like every company,

09:09.313 --> 09:11.147
we've had our troubles
with the Union.

09:11.182 --> 09:13.716
You're probably not gonna get
a lot of help out of those guys,

09:13.751 --> 09:15.518
but we'll do everything we can.

09:15.553 --> 09:17.887
Sooner we can rid the docks
of this element, the better.

09:17.922 --> 09:20.190
All right, well,
you can start by getting us

09:20.224 --> 09:21.991
all your surveillance
video footage --

09:22.026 --> 09:23.326
Anyplace you got a camera.

09:23.360 --> 09:25.395
You got it.

09:25.429 --> 09:28.398
He's right, you know.
Longshoremen won't talk.

09:28.432 --> 09:29.766
It goes against their code.

09:29.800 --> 09:31.334
Remember that line
from "on the waterfront"?

09:31.368 --> 09:33.036
"I don't know nothin'.

09:33.070 --> 09:35.805
I ain't seen nothin'.
I ain't sayin' nothin'."

09:35.839 --> 09:37.507
Here's the deal.

09:37.541 --> 09:39.776
<i>I'll do sensitivity training,
you don't do Brando.</i>

09:49.753 --> 09:52.889
Could he be more anal?

09:52.923 --> 09:55.558
Actually, yes.

09:55.593 --> 09:59.262
Although he exhibits many of
the classic Freudian traits --

09:59.296 --> 10:02.699
rigidity, fixation on rules
and orderliness --

10:02.733 --> 10:05.835
his autopsy work
is less than meticulous.

10:05.869 --> 10:07.904
When will you be starting?

10:07.938 --> 10:09.372
Momentarily.

10:09.406 --> 10:10.807
Seems not much stock is put

10:10.841 --> 10:13.243
in the proper placement
of instruments here.

10:13.277 --> 10:16.246
You gonna let him
talk to you like that?

10:16.280 --> 10:18.982
This is ridiculous.

10:19.817 --> 10:21.451
You're his boss.

10:24.622 --> 10:27.056
Is there something particular
you require, doctor?

10:27.091 --> 10:29.692
Yes. Organization.

10:29.727 --> 10:33.496
Now, we have a well-developed
female Caucasian,

10:33.530 --> 10:35.298
22 years old,

10:35.332 --> 10:38.334
with an incised gaping wound
across the neck.

10:38.369 --> 10:39.869
Later that same day...

10:39.903 --> 10:41.271
I do miss this.

10:41.305 --> 10:43.039
Not many near decapitations

10:43.073 --> 10:44.641
in the hinterlands
of Western Massachusetts.

10:44.675 --> 10:48.578
The ice pick is a nice touch,

10:48.612 --> 10:51.481
though unnecessary --
she bled out in under a minute.

10:51.515 --> 10:53.816
That Doyle really is a butcher,
isn't he?

10:53.851 --> 10:55.885
Will you excuse me?

11:03.927 --> 11:06.262
Don't let that idiot get to you.

11:06.297 --> 11:09.666
Well, I can't fault him
for telling the truth.

11:09.700 --> 11:12.702
<i>Paddy Doyle is a butcher.</i>

11:12.736 --> 11:14.637
Paddy Doyle has nothing to do
with you.

11:14.672 --> 11:16.873
He fathered me.

11:16.907 --> 11:19.475
He...Simply provided
the sperm.

11:19.510 --> 11:21.644
All right?

11:21.679 --> 11:24.647
And judging by the amazing
person that you turned out to be,

11:24.682 --> 11:26.349
his DNA didn't win.

11:27.751 --> 11:29.886
I don't understand the strategy
behind this attack.

11:29.920 --> 11:31.454
Well, that's simple.

11:31.488 --> 11:32.889
I mean, Doyle is just
trying to scare the hell

11:32.923 --> 11:34.757
out of anybody that won't do
his bidding at the docks.

11:34.792 --> 11:38.094
No. I-I meant Tommy's decision
to move his rook to b5.

11:39.330 --> 11:40.830
Wait a minute.
My little brother

11:40.864 --> 11:42.565
is im'ing you at the office and
sending you little smiley faces,

11:42.599 --> 11:44.934
and there's nothing going on
between you two?

11:44.968 --> 11:47.670
Well, you and I keep in
touch throughout the day.

11:47.705 --> 11:49.672
It must be my amazing
long bones.

11:49.707 --> 11:51.808
Oh!

11:51.842 --> 11:53.443
Mm. Mnh-mnh.

11:54.878 --> 11:55.945
What --

11:55.979 --> 11:57.680
Shh!

11:59.483 --> 12:02.785
I hope you can forgive me for my
invasion of your personal space.

12:02.820 --> 12:05.621
Allow me to introduce myself
so we can dialogue.

12:05.656 --> 12:07.223
My name is Carol Madigan.

12:07.257 --> 12:09.392
Sensitivity training liaison.

12:09.426 --> 12:12.462
Dr. Maura Isles.

12:12.496 --> 12:13.596
How may I help you?

12:13.630 --> 12:15.765
I'm looking for
detective Rizzoli,

12:15.799 --> 12:18.201
who I'm told is here,
although she's scheduled

12:18.235 --> 12:20.603
to be in my "connect, protect,
and respect" class.

12:20.637 --> 12:22.071
You seen her?

12:23.574 --> 12:26.209
I believe she is
in the building.

12:26.243 --> 12:30.680
Um, but...I don't see her
right now.

12:30.714 --> 12:32.014
Tell her I'm looking for her.

12:35.652 --> 12:36.819
Where's Jane?

12:36.854 --> 12:39.622
You sicced that
sensitivity freak on me?

12:39.656 --> 12:42.125
<i>"Freak"? Maybe you do need
sensitivity training.</i>

12:42.159 --> 12:43.760
Got the victim,
Melissa's, address.

12:43.794 --> 12:45.628
You gonna hide,
or you want to come with me?

12:45.662 --> 12:46.896
How'd you get it?

12:46.930 --> 12:48.598
Melissa had to file
a dockworker's card

12:48.632 --> 12:49.899
with homeland security --
They had a local address.

12:49.933 --> 12:53.202
Great work,
sergeant detective Korsak.

12:53.237 --> 12:54.871
I think that
we should investigate,

12:54.905 --> 12:56.706
<i>but what do you think?</i>

13:03.447 --> 13:06.382
We're very sorry
for your loss.

13:09.787 --> 13:12.221
It's the first time
I've ever been glad

13:12.256 --> 13:14.290
my father's not aware
of anything.

13:14.324 --> 13:17.293
I wouldn't know how to
tell him about my sister.

13:17.327 --> 13:20.263
And can we ask what
he's suffering from?

13:20.297 --> 13:21.964
A head injury.

13:21.999 --> 13:25.234
Doctors say he probably
won't come back from it.

13:25.269 --> 13:28.538
He was hurt six months ago.
He's a longshoreman.

13:30.841 --> 13:33.276
Um...

13:33.310 --> 13:34.544
Can you think of anyone

13:34.578 --> 13:36.646
who might have
wanted to harm your sister?

13:38.549 --> 13:39.849
You ever heard of Paddy Doyle?

13:39.883 --> 13:42.885
Everybody in Southie has.
Why?

13:42.920 --> 13:44.887
Any issues between your father
and Doyle?

13:44.922 --> 13:46.823
Your dad ever mention him
coming around the docks

13:46.857 --> 13:47.957
or the Union hall?

13:47.991 --> 13:49.859
Never.

13:49.893 --> 13:51.427
Did she ever mention Doyle's
name in the last few months?

13:51.462 --> 13:53.429
No. Melissa's
a college student.

13:53.464 --> 13:57.900
Actually, she went by her
initials, M.J., at the docks.

13:57.935 --> 14:00.303
What? Nobody called her that.

14:00.337 --> 14:02.371
Why was she at the docks?

14:02.406 --> 14:03.539
She was working
as a casual there.

14:03.574 --> 14:05.608
Last place she was seen alive.

14:05.642 --> 14:08.344
I can't believe
she did this.

14:08.378 --> 14:09.612
Did what, Shannon?

14:09.646 --> 14:12.114
The Union said our dad's
accident was his fault

14:12.149 --> 14:13.783
because he'd been drinking
on the job.

14:13.817 --> 14:16.419
Melissa wouldn't believe it.

14:16.453 --> 14:20.389
She...Was gonna find out
the truth for herself.

14:26.864 --> 14:28.798
- Dr. Isles?
- Yes.

14:28.832 --> 14:30.867
I discovered in the victim's
stomach contents

14:30.901 --> 14:33.736
a micro SD card.

14:33.770 --> 14:35.972
- It's from a camera.
- Video, my guess.

14:36.006 --> 14:38.508
Must have swallowed it
just before she was killed,

14:38.542 --> 14:40.443
and I'll bet
Paddy Doyle wanted it.

14:40.477 --> 14:43.279
That sounds very much
like an assumption.

14:43.313 --> 14:45.314
You think there's
a drug deal on it?

14:45.349 --> 14:46.582
A murder.

14:46.617 --> 14:48.518
I don't... know.

14:48.552 --> 14:51.420
Nor is it within our
purview to guess.

14:51.455 --> 14:53.756
Please take this up to
detective frost in homicide.

14:53.790 --> 14:56.792
Arguably the most important find
against a notorious mobster,

14:56.827 --> 14:58.628
and I'll be credited with it,

14:58.662 --> 15:00.429
all because you needed help.

15:00.464 --> 15:02.532
Funny, huh?

15:04.568 --> 15:07.436
Funny, good night, Doctor.

15:24.555 --> 15:26.155
Please don't sit in my chair.

15:38.802 --> 15:41.671
I'm very intrigued by
the assertiveness of your play.

15:41.705 --> 15:43.839
Just giving what I'm getting.

15:48.378 --> 15:50.746
And what does that tell you?

15:51.949 --> 15:53.282
What the hell?!

15:53.317 --> 15:54.350
Wait -- Tommy, don't!

15:54.384 --> 15:56.552
He needs a doctor -- now!

15:56.587 --> 15:58.988
My God, that's Paddy Doyle.

16:00.857 --> 16:02.892
I know who he is.

16:10.414 --> 16:13.349
The bullet seems to have
fractured your clavicle.

16:13.383 --> 16:15.518
You're lucky.

16:15.552 --> 16:16.719
Thought your idea of luck

16:16.753 --> 16:18.387
would have been if
had pierced my heart.

16:22.459 --> 16:24.827
The bone prevented the bullet
from hitting a major artery.

16:24.862 --> 16:27.396
Been through this before.
Just need stitching up.

16:27.431 --> 16:28.998
It's not that simple.

16:29.032 --> 16:31.033
You have tissue damage,
vasculature concerns,

16:31.068 --> 16:32.535
- bone fragments.
- Do it...

16:32.569 --> 16:35.338
- Or he dies.
- I'll need his help.

16:35.372 --> 16:38.474
Please ask the guy with the gun
to stop pointing it at him.

16:42.346 --> 16:45.148
Tommy, find me some towels,

16:45.182 --> 16:46.616
bowls, um, hot water.

16:46.650 --> 16:50.219
I'll need to irrigate the wound
before I can suture.

16:50.254 --> 16:52.054
That your boyfriend?

16:52.089 --> 16:54.090
You're holding me hostage.

16:54.124 --> 16:56.492
You think you have any right
to ask me personal questions?

16:59.329 --> 17:01.230
The exit wound is quite large.

17:01.265 --> 17:03.399
It's gonna be difficult
to close.

17:03.433 --> 17:04.767
I don't have anesthetic.

17:04.800 --> 17:06.935
Don't need any.

17:09.772 --> 17:13.476
What happened?
How did you get shot?

17:13.510 --> 17:15.478
Business.

17:15.512 --> 17:17.747
Was the woman murdered
at the docks "business," too?

17:17.781 --> 17:21.083
Not mine.

17:21.117 --> 17:23.452
I didn't kill her.

17:27.324 --> 17:29.559
How the hell do you
know this guy anyway?

17:33.764 --> 17:35.631
I'm her father.

17:42.639 --> 17:44.307
Hey.

17:44.341 --> 17:47.510
Sutton sent over all the
dock surveillance footage.

17:47.544 --> 17:49.078
Found Melissa leaving.

17:49.112 --> 17:51.180
<i>So she did leave
in the middle of her shift.</i>

17:51.215 --> 17:52.315
I wonder why.

17:52.349 --> 17:54.317
No idea. But no one follows her.

17:54.351 --> 17:56.219
Well, it's not like
Doyle's the type

17:56.253 --> 17:57.853
to show up
on surveillance footage.

17:57.888 --> 17:59.622
Anything on the SD card?

17:59.656 --> 18:00.656
Still trying.

18:00.691 --> 18:02.425
Stomach acid did a number on it.

18:02.459 --> 18:04.393
I don't have any audio,
but look at this.

18:06.463 --> 18:08.364
I only got a few frames.

18:09.433 --> 18:11.400
Someone's chasing her.

18:11.435 --> 18:12.969
Yeah, Paddy Doyle.

18:13.003 --> 18:16.372
Oh, we just need one frame
of that bastard's face.

18:17.507 --> 18:22.044
Oh, yay.
Officer helpful's back.

18:22.079 --> 18:25.047
Hey, uh, yeah.
Thanks for bringing that up.

18:25.082 --> 18:27.483
Um, a battery probably
isn't going to help

18:27.517 --> 18:28.651
with the investigation,

18:28.685 --> 18:31.420
so you can just take that down
to evidence.

18:34.124 --> 18:36.292
It's not in the job description

18:36.326 --> 18:38.661
to bust my balls for homicide.

18:40.664 --> 18:42.598
<i>Why doesn't he have to take
sensitivity training?</i>

18:42.633 --> 18:44.567
- He already did.
- Works wonders.

18:44.601 --> 18:46.402
Did some checking
on Richie Black.

18:46.436 --> 18:48.271
Before he wound up
on a ventilator,

18:48.305 --> 18:49.705
he was pretty much
a dockworking stiff.

18:49.740 --> 18:52.174
No criminal record,
not a single tie to Doyle.

18:52.209 --> 18:54.510
No, he works the docks,
Paddy owns the docks --

18:54.544 --> 18:56.212
there's your connection.

18:56.246 --> 18:57.647
I also got a copy
of his OSHA accident report.

18:57.681 --> 19:00.249
Lab from the E.R.
said his blood alcohol was .10.

19:00.284 --> 19:02.351
Guess he was drinking
on the job.

19:02.386 --> 19:03.519
Yeah, but Melissa didn't believe
he did it.

19:03.553 --> 19:04.954
She went undercover
to prove it.

19:04.988 --> 19:06.289
Maybe she stumbled
across something

19:06.323 --> 19:08.090
she wasn't supposed to.

19:08.125 --> 19:10.026
That alone's enough to get
her killed. Weapons, drugs,

19:10.060 --> 19:11.494
human trafficking --
It all goes through the docks.

19:11.528 --> 19:13.429
We got to get one of those
dockworkers to talk.

19:13.463 --> 19:15.464
I just wish we didn't
have to wait till tomorrow.

19:15.499 --> 19:17.366
We don't. High tide's at 2:01.
They'll all be there.

19:17.401 --> 19:19.035
How do you know so
much about it?

19:19.069 --> 19:20.603
I had an uncle
who was a stevedore.

19:20.637 --> 19:22.204
I flirted with it
in my younger days.

19:22.239 --> 19:23.372
Decided it wasn't a good fit.

19:23.407 --> 19:24.674
I like my fingers and toes.

19:24.708 --> 19:26.542
So you could have been
a longshoreman.

19:26.576 --> 19:28.444
More than that. I coulda been a contender.

19:28.478 --> 19:29.712
Stop.

19:29.746 --> 19:31.814
Instead of a bum,
which is what I am!

19:37.654 --> 19:39.288
You all right?

19:40.657 --> 19:43.726
Fine.

19:43.760 --> 19:45.795
So, what are you,
adopted or something?

19:47.531 --> 19:49.832
Yes.

19:49.866 --> 19:52.101
How long did you know
you were related to him?

19:52.135 --> 19:54.770
Not long.

19:56.506 --> 19:58.808
Bishop to d7 captures the rook.

20:00.243 --> 20:01.811
Check.

20:01.845 --> 20:03.245
It's okay.

20:03.280 --> 20:04.814
We don't need to talk about it.

20:09.486 --> 20:11.487
Help him.

20:12.189 --> 20:13.689
Help him!

20:13.724 --> 20:15.458
Like this?

20:15.492 --> 20:16.726
You want him to die, dude?

20:16.760 --> 20:18.627
- Shut up!
- Stop!

20:23.633 --> 20:24.934
Now fix him!

20:49.626 --> 20:51.694
He really should be
on an I.V.

20:51.728 --> 20:55.498
His body is working to replace
fluids and white cells.

20:55.532 --> 20:58.834
You look
a lot like your mother.

21:00.370 --> 21:02.338
Who was my mother?

21:02.372 --> 21:06.308
You would like her.

21:06.343 --> 21:09.044
She would like you.

21:09.079 --> 21:11.781
Did she love you?

21:11.815 --> 21:15.584
She did.

21:15.619 --> 21:18.687
But you would still like her.

21:28.131 --> 21:30.499
We can't possibly talk
to all these jimokes.

21:30.534 --> 21:31.767
Pick a target.

21:31.802 --> 21:33.302
Oh-ho, look who's back.

21:33.336 --> 21:36.172
Baby, I guess
you want some of this.

21:36.206 --> 21:38.407
Oh, get your hands
off your junk!

21:38.442 --> 21:40.109
This detective's a lady.

21:40.143 --> 21:42.044
What?

21:42.078 --> 21:46.081
Thank you, kind sir,
for defending my honor.

21:46.116 --> 21:48.217
No, I merely defended
an individual

21:48.251 --> 21:51.454
who happens to be female
from an inappropriate harasser

21:51.488 --> 21:52.755
who happens to be male.

21:52.789 --> 21:54.123
Mm-hmm.

21:54.157 --> 21:55.491
Speaking of which,

21:55.525 --> 21:57.126
why don't you try
to get through to the gorillas

21:57.160 --> 21:59.128
and I'll talk to her.

21:59.162 --> 22:01.330
Hey. Boston Homicide.

22:01.364 --> 22:03.365
Can I ask you a couple questions
about M.J. Black?

22:03.400 --> 22:04.500
I don't know anything.

22:04.534 --> 22:05.568
Even if I did,

22:05.602 --> 22:07.169
Union rep told us not to talk.

22:08.705 --> 22:11.173
Whose hand is this?

22:11.208 --> 22:13.342
Because I found it on my ass.

22:13.376 --> 22:15.544
Got one more
where that came from.

22:15.579 --> 22:17.012
- Do you?
- Yes.

22:17.047 --> 22:19.315
- Here's what I got.
- Aah.

22:20.951 --> 22:23.486
- Hey, let go!
- Freakin' lezzie.

22:23.520 --> 22:25.454
- What the hell happened?!
- What? He grabbed my ass.

22:25.489 --> 22:28.557
- This scumbag had the nerve to put
his filthy hands on you? - Just one.

22:28.592 --> 22:31.393
That's all I need to take you
in, you dumb son of a bitch.

22:31.428 --> 22:32.561
Come on.

22:32.596 --> 22:34.997
Rizzoli.

22:35.031 --> 22:36.465
Yeah, okay.

22:36.500 --> 22:37.633
We got another dead body.

22:37.667 --> 22:40.469
It's Paddy Doyle's
right-hand man.

22:44.140 --> 22:45.908
Kevin Brennan.

22:45.942 --> 22:48.811
He and Paddy got kicked out
of grammar school together.

22:48.845 --> 22:51.046
They've been partners in crime
ever since.

22:51.081 --> 22:53.883
Multiple GSWs.

22:53.917 --> 22:55.084
Maybe they had a falling out.

22:55.118 --> 22:57.186
I don't see an ice pick.

22:57.220 --> 22:58.921
How many shell casings
are there?

22:58.955 --> 23:01.423
They're still counting them.

23:01.458 --> 23:03.225
Why?

23:03.260 --> 23:05.127
This just -- It feels like an
ambush more than an execution.

23:05.161 --> 23:06.428
You know?

23:06.463 --> 23:09.465
This guy spends 50 years
attached to Paddy's hip,

23:09.499 --> 23:11.033
and then winds up dead?

23:11.067 --> 23:13.402
I don't think
Brennan was the target.

23:13.436 --> 23:17.373
And, either his blood
got on Paddy's shoes,

23:17.407 --> 23:19.408
or Paddy took a bullet himself.

23:19.442 --> 23:21.043
I'll have CSRU
check the blood trail.

23:21.077 --> 23:22.478
See if there's more
than one type.

23:22.512 --> 23:24.213
So we talking mob war?

23:24.247 --> 23:26.549
Yeah, maybe,
for control of the docks.

23:26.583 --> 23:29.685
Ohh, what the hell
is pike doing here?

23:30.453 --> 23:31.520
Detectives.

23:31.555 --> 23:33.856
Where's Dr. Isles?

23:33.890 --> 23:35.157
I have no idea,

23:35.191 --> 23:36.425
nor do I understand
your question's relevance

23:36.459 --> 23:38.093
given our nearly
identical credentials.

23:38.128 --> 23:39.828
Just tell us what
you're doing here.

23:39.863 --> 23:42.731
Dr. Isles was unreachable.

23:44.501 --> 23:46.735
- Frost.
- Yeah, I got it. Go.

23:47.938 --> 23:50.439
It's discrimination,
pure and simple.

23:50.473 --> 23:53.542
The Governor felt he needed
to appoint a "woman."

23:53.577 --> 23:56.912
Once again, I'm penalized
for being a white male.

23:56.947 --> 24:00.382
Don't even.

24:03.920 --> 24:05.921
That's probably Jane.

24:05.956 --> 24:07.256
Let it go.

24:10.827 --> 24:12.394
Why did you even come here?

24:12.429 --> 24:15.364
You could have paid off any
number of doctors for treatment.

24:15.398 --> 24:18.767
<i>But they wouldn't
have been you.</i>

24:18.802 --> 24:20.836
That's supposed
to warm my heart?

24:20.870 --> 24:22.004
<i>Because it doesn't.</i>

24:22.038 --> 24:24.340
I've seen what
you're capable of.

24:24.374 --> 24:26.075
I saw what you did
to that young woman!

24:26.109 --> 24:27.843
I didn't do anything to her.

24:27.877 --> 24:29.745
I don't kill women or children

24:29.779 --> 24:31.780
or anyone who doesn't
deserve it.

24:31.815 --> 24:33.916
Oh, so even you have standards?

24:33.950 --> 24:36.285
Regardless of what you think
of me, Maura,

24:36.319 --> 24:38.554
in my world,
I'm a man of honor...

24:38.588 --> 24:40.222
And of my word.

24:41.524 --> 24:43.392
I'm being framed.

24:46.162 --> 24:48.664
I don't believe you.

24:50.333 --> 24:52.101
You're the chief
medical examiner.

24:52.135 --> 24:53.435
Use your science.

24:54.804 --> 24:57.973
It'll tell you if I'm
guilty or not.

24:58.008 --> 24:59.942
Where are you going?

24:59.976 --> 25:04.113
To finish what
someone else started.

25:19.374 --> 25:22.310
- Jane.
- Where is he? Where's Doyle?

25:22.344 --> 25:23.744
Gone. 15 minutes ago.

25:23.779 --> 25:26.080
Paddy was shot, right?

25:26.114 --> 25:27.648
A bullet fractured
his clavicle.

25:27.683 --> 25:29.116
He lost a lot of blood,

25:29.151 --> 25:30.584
but the injuries
weren't life-threatening.

25:30.619 --> 25:32.153
How'd you know?

25:32.187 --> 25:33.754
Well, because I just came
from a crime scene

25:33.789 --> 25:37.191
where his top lieutenant
wasn't so lucky.

25:37.225 --> 25:38.526
Do you know what happened?

25:38.560 --> 25:40.227
No, but for Paddy Doyle
to take a bullet,

25:40.262 --> 25:41.762
somebody he trusted
must have given him up.

25:41.797 --> 25:43.230
God, it looks like an E.R.
in here.

25:43.265 --> 25:44.598
Maura had to fix him
at gunpoint!

25:44.633 --> 25:47.468
He told me that the shooting
was over business.

25:47.502 --> 25:49.170
So, what?

25:49.204 --> 25:52.073
So Melissa's murder was under
the category of pleasure?

25:52.107 --> 25:54.508
No, he. He said somebody
was trying to frame him.

25:54.543 --> 25:57.411
That he doesn't kill women
or children or innocents.

25:57.446 --> 25:59.013
Of course he told
you that, Maura.

25:59.047 --> 26:00.448
He's not gonna confess
to the one person in the world

26:00.482 --> 26:02.049
that he gives a damn about.

26:02.084 --> 26:04.618
A mob boss like Paddy Doyle
couldn't rule the streets

26:04.653 --> 26:06.087
this long just on fear.

26:06.121 --> 26:08.823
He lives by a code.
That's why he has respect.

26:08.857 --> 26:10.291
Are you finished?

26:10.325 --> 26:12.293
He has a heart, Jane.

26:12.327 --> 26:14.395
I'm serious! You didn't see
the way he looked at her.

26:14.429 --> 26:17.565
He may be a bad guy,
but he loves his daughter.

26:22.070 --> 26:23.437
All of his victims
were gangsters --

26:23.472 --> 26:24.538
No women, no children.

26:24.573 --> 26:26.307
That we know of.

26:26.341 --> 26:29.176
No forensic evidence links Paddy
to any of these killings.

26:29.211 --> 26:31.612
None of his DNA was recovered
from Melissa, either.

26:31.646 --> 26:33.414
He's good.

26:33.448 --> 26:35.549
Yeah, that's part
of his legend.

26:35.584 --> 26:38.252
He may go down for racketeering
or tax evasion like Capone,

26:38.286 --> 26:40.454
but murder? No way.

26:40.489 --> 26:43.324
He isn't usually this messy.

26:43.358 --> 26:45.393
You think he's slipping?

26:45.427 --> 26:47.528
He told Maura
he was being framed.

26:47.562 --> 26:50.231
Nobody's stupid enough
or suicidal enough

26:50.265 --> 26:51.766
to frame him for murder.

26:51.800 --> 26:54.535
Yeah, but it would be brilliant

26:54.569 --> 26:55.703
if somebody could pull it off.

26:55.737 --> 26:57.571
You know, murder Melissa,

26:57.606 --> 27:00.341
make it look like Doyle did
the deed -- case closed.

27:00.375 --> 27:03.210
Hey, Frost, you get any audio
of that SD card yet?

27:03.245 --> 27:04.412
No.

27:04.446 --> 27:05.713
Oh, whiz kid's
finally met his match --

27:05.747 --> 27:07.715
a half-digested SD card.

27:07.749 --> 27:11.018
- Hey, if you want to try...
- Oh, God.

27:11.053 --> 27:12.453
Can somebody please sign
for this?

27:12.487 --> 27:15.089
<i>And torture the poor guy?
He's here for you, Jane.</i>

27:15.123 --> 27:17.124
- No, he's not.
- Oh, yes, he is.

27:17.159 --> 27:19.527
<i>This guy hates me.
I'll show you.</i>

27:20.495 --> 27:22.129
On your desk, Rizzoli?

27:22.164 --> 27:26.033
Uh, no. I-I'll take it,
but thank you...

27:26.068 --> 27:27.401
Very much...

27:27.436 --> 27:29.437
Officer Duncan. Thanks.

27:29.471 --> 27:31.272
Actually, this is kind of heavy.

27:31.306 --> 27:33.707
I could take it down
to evidence for you if you want.

27:33.742 --> 27:35.176
- That's okay.
- No, it --

27:35.210 --> 27:37.078
- No, it's okay. I got it.
- It's okay.

27:39.114 --> 27:41.382
I got it!
Thank you.

27:45.320 --> 27:47.488
Thank you.

27:50.292 --> 27:51.759
See?

27:51.793 --> 27:53.127
Love.

27:53.161 --> 27:54.528
- Stop.
- Love.

27:54.563 --> 27:55.663
Shut up.

27:55.697 --> 27:57.965
All right, what do
we have in here?

27:57.999 --> 28:00.000
We got a stereo, a CD player,

28:00.035 --> 28:01.335
some wires.

28:01.369 --> 28:03.003
An amplifier.

28:03.038 --> 28:04.672
Oh, yeah, that looks modified.
Check it out, Frost.

28:04.706 --> 28:06.307
Axl's time in lockup
is almost up.

28:06.341 --> 28:08.375
Hopefully it's put him
in a mood to talk.

28:11.480 --> 28:14.181
Dr. Pike.

28:14.216 --> 28:16.183
I've...Looked through
your report

28:16.218 --> 28:17.351
on Melissa Joy Black.

28:17.385 --> 28:18.986
I didn't see a reference

28:19.020 --> 28:21.188
to an examination of
the victim's teeth or gums.

28:21.223 --> 28:23.257
Cause of death was quite clear,
as is my report.

28:23.291 --> 28:27.561
I didn't feel the need
to floss her molars.

28:27.596 --> 28:31.198
Specifically, I am concerned
about the post-mortem bruising

28:31.233 --> 28:34.635
around the victim's mouth,
here and here.

28:34.669 --> 28:38.172
Hmm.
Which I noted on page 27.

28:38.206 --> 28:41.108
But, uh, it suggests

28:41.143 --> 28:44.411
that the perpetrator applied
force against the victim's mouth

28:44.446 --> 28:45.679
during the attack.

28:45.714 --> 28:47.948
And what's your point?

28:47.983 --> 28:51.185
Detective Rizzoli's
investigation indicated

28:51.219 --> 28:52.586
that this was
a very brave young woman

28:52.621 --> 28:54.488
going undercover on her own.

28:54.523 --> 28:55.956
I don't make my rulings

28:55.991 --> 28:57.658
based on a victim's
personality traits.

28:57.692 --> 29:01.128
Well, neither --
neither do I.

29:01.163 --> 29:03.297
But I would consider
that such a woman

29:03.331 --> 29:04.732
may have bitten her killer.

29:04.766 --> 29:06.367
Mm.

29:06.401 --> 29:08.369
I want to see the body.

29:08.403 --> 29:10.371
Already released
to the funeral home

29:10.405 --> 29:11.639
per her family's request.

29:11.673 --> 29:13.240
Without my approval?

29:13.275 --> 29:15.442
I'm a medical examiner, too.

29:15.477 --> 29:18.646
<i>No, you are an assistant
medical examiner.</i>

29:18.680 --> 29:21.015
You work for me,
Dr. Pike.

29:22.517 --> 29:23.684
It figures that someone like you
would try and pull rank.

29:23.718 --> 29:25.753
I went to Harvard,
you know that?

29:25.787 --> 29:28.189
Shut it!

29:28.223 --> 29:29.557
Or I will assign you to a town

29:29.591 --> 29:31.492
that will make Western Mass
feel like Paris.

29:31.526 --> 29:32.660
You have one hour

29:32.694 --> 29:35.229
to get that body back,
understand?

29:35.263 --> 29:36.764
Yes, doctor.

29:41.102 --> 29:43.003
Was there any talk
about M.J.,

29:43.038 --> 29:44.972
anybody following her around?

29:45.006 --> 29:46.240
I ain't saying nothin'.

29:46.274 --> 29:49.076
Especially to no dumb bitch.

29:49.110 --> 29:51.345
Hey! Show some respect,
piece of crap!

29:53.348 --> 29:55.282
Nice moobs.
Moobs?

29:55.317 --> 29:56.417
Yeah, man boobs.

29:57.752 --> 29:59.587
Your little grab ass
at the docks--?

29:59.621 --> 30:02.089
That's indecent assault
and battery on a police officer.

30:02.123 --> 30:03.424
You're looking at seven
and a half years.

30:03.458 --> 30:04.558
You got 30 seconds

30:04.593 --> 30:05.960
before we officially
press charges.

30:07.095 --> 30:09.430
Remember Melissa Black.

30:09.464 --> 30:12.032
She was murdered,
and we think you know why.

30:12.067 --> 30:15.903
No, man.
I barely knew the broad.

30:16.738 --> 30:18.539
You sure as hell
knew her father,

30:18.573 --> 30:19.740
Richie Black, didn't you?

30:19.774 --> 30:21.742
You serious?

30:21.776 --> 30:23.410
She was his kid?

30:23.445 --> 30:24.878
10 seconds.

30:27.582 --> 30:28.716
5 seconds.

30:28.750 --> 30:30.618
Richie was
a stand-up guy.

30:30.652 --> 30:33.821
He wasn't afraid to roll up
his sleeves like the rest of us.

30:33.855 --> 30:36.390
He had my vote.

30:36.424 --> 30:38.158
- He was running to be your Union rep?
- Yeah.

30:38.193 --> 30:40.127
Safety on the docks
been going to hell,

30:40.161 --> 30:42.062
and Richie was the only one
taking it on.

30:42.097 --> 30:45.165
It looked like he was gonna win
when he had his accident.

30:45.200 --> 30:46.233
Who was his competition?

30:46.268 --> 30:50.004
It's the guy who won -- Ray.

30:50.038 --> 30:52.406
Maybe Paddy had something to do
with Richie's "accident."

30:53.608 --> 30:55.743
Paddy and Ray
would be good pals.

30:55.777 --> 30:57.444
Look at Ray's rap sheet.

30:57.479 --> 30:59.113
Assault, fraud.

30:59.147 --> 31:01.548
Put his 6-year-old
on the Union payroll.

31:01.583 --> 31:03.384
Poor Richie. That's not
a guy to run against.

31:03.418 --> 31:05.386
Melissa must have thought
that Paddy and Richie

31:05.420 --> 31:07.087
had something to do
with her father's accident.

31:07.122 --> 31:09.223
So she spies on Ray to prove it.

31:09.257 --> 31:11.458
You have any footage of Ray
the day that Melissa left early?

31:11.493 --> 31:13.260
Yeah. Here.

31:13.295 --> 31:16.664
Looks like Ray left
mid-shift, too.

31:16.698 --> 31:20.100
Just a few minutes
before Melissa did.

31:20.135 --> 31:23.170
Go to the dock
parking-lot camera.

31:27.075 --> 31:29.710
Ray's got nice wheels.

31:29.744 --> 31:33.013
No way can that guy afford an
AMG on a longshoreman's salary.

31:33.048 --> 31:35.382
Pull up the footage
of when Melissa left.

31:36.451 --> 31:38.552
There she is.

31:38.586 --> 31:40.387
Yeah.

31:40.422 --> 31:42.189
Leaving right behind him.

31:42.223 --> 31:44.391
So she wasn't
being followed.

31:44.426 --> 31:47.428
No, she was following Ray.

31:51.287 --> 31:52.800
Ray's wife she's at
the docks today.

31:53.500 --> 31:55.132
Why? They don't work
when the tide's low.

31:55.170 --> 31:56.975
You ever shake hands with the
guy? It's like a marshmallow.

31:56.976 --> 31:58.973
Ray doesn't work much at all.

32:00.141 --> 32:02.476
Hey, there!

32:02.510 --> 32:04.278
Miss Madigan.

32:04.312 --> 32:06.480
Sensitivity trainer.
I was gonna call you.

32:06.514 --> 32:07.982
And tell me that she failed
to complete her training...

32:08.016 --> 32:09.650
Again?

32:09.684 --> 32:12.586
You can just forget about
winning that extra "c" day,

32:12.621 --> 32:13.787
sergeant detective Korsak.

32:13.822 --> 32:15.823
That's why you've been
all over this?

32:15.857 --> 32:17.458
So you can get
an extra day off?

32:17.492 --> 32:19.493
I also happen to feel
very strongly

32:19.527 --> 32:21.362
about the teaching
of tolerance.

32:21.396 --> 32:23.864
Really? Because I just got out
of a half-hour meeting

32:23.898 --> 32:26.367
with Mr. Dwyer, who's lodging
a formal complaint

32:26.401 --> 32:29.069
about the abusive treatment
he received while in custody.

32:29.104 --> 32:31.639
Did you tell Mr. Dwyer
he had moobs?

32:33.441 --> 32:35.676
Yes. Yes, I did.

32:35.710 --> 32:40.047
And I am completely ashamed
by the cruelty of my words.

32:40.081 --> 32:44.652
It was inappropriate and unkind

32:44.686 --> 32:46.987
and insensitive.

32:47.022 --> 32:48.956
No charges will be
filed, Mr. Dwyer,

32:48.990 --> 32:52.126
and I do hope that you can
accept my sincerest apologies.

32:54.496 --> 32:56.330
I-I guess so.

32:56.364 --> 32:58.532
I-I do have every intention

32:58.566 --> 33:01.802
of finishing my sensitivity
training, asap.

33:01.836 --> 33:03.404
Thank you, detective.

33:03.438 --> 33:04.772
Uh, now, if you'll excuse us,

33:04.806 --> 33:06.974
we are in pursuit of a suspect.

33:07.008 --> 33:09.209
Oh, of course.

33:10.478 --> 33:11.745
Take care.

33:12.881 --> 33:14.448
Quite a performance.

33:14.482 --> 33:18.018
Incredibly sensitive,
don't you think?

33:19.487 --> 33:21.689
You're lucky
they hadn't begun

33:21.723 --> 33:22.923
the embalming process yet.

33:22.957 --> 33:25.626
I don't know why you're not
doing this yourself.

33:25.660 --> 33:28.295
Because it's your case,
Dr. Pike.

33:28.329 --> 33:31.632
I'm not overriding it,
I'm... expanding upon it.

33:31.666 --> 33:33.367
Isn't that a fine euphemism

33:33.401 --> 33:35.269
for insulting
my professionalism.

33:37.405 --> 33:39.873
This isn't personal,
Dr. Pike.

33:39.908 --> 33:41.809
It certainly feels
that way to me.

33:44.713 --> 33:48.449
I'd focus on the maxillary
central incisors,

33:48.483 --> 33:50.284
as well as the canines.

33:50.318 --> 33:52.586
I'm not seeing anything at all.

33:52.620 --> 33:54.354
She has a bit of an underbite.

33:54.389 --> 33:56.156
Check the mandibulars, as well.

33:57.992 --> 34:01.095
I think I found a particle.

34:04.599 --> 34:06.734
It appears to be skin.

34:11.873 --> 34:13.574
After analysis,

34:13.608 --> 34:16.710
add this as an addendum
to your original autopsy report.

34:16.745 --> 34:19.012
I don't need your pity.
This was your find.

34:19.047 --> 34:21.915
But your autopsy.
You take the credit.

34:21.949 --> 34:23.550
I insist.

34:23.585 --> 34:25.485
Thank you.

34:44.639 --> 34:48.708
Boston police!
Open up!

34:54.783 --> 34:57.417
<i>He's not whimpering.</i>

34:57.452 --> 35:00.954
Not anymore.

35:12.000 --> 35:13.333
You okay?

35:13.368 --> 35:14.635
No, it was horrible.

35:14.669 --> 35:18.539
Oh, my God! Poor Ray!
Oh, my God!

35:20.074 --> 35:22.776
Do you remember anything?
Anything you saw or you heard?

35:22.811 --> 35:25.679
I just heard screaming.
I just heard screaming.

35:25.713 --> 35:27.548
Looks like he was
tortured first.

35:27.582 --> 35:29.249
Two of his fingers are broken.

35:29.284 --> 35:31.819
Yeah, and eight of them aren't,
so he must have talked.

35:33.288 --> 35:36.356
The question is,
who'd he give up?

35:36.391 --> 35:38.692
Or what?

35:47.402 --> 35:49.069
Hi.

35:49.103 --> 35:50.938
Did you get the DNA results
back on the skin yet?

35:50.972 --> 35:52.639
I'm sorry?

35:52.674 --> 35:54.341
The DNA results.

35:54.375 --> 35:55.676
On the skin particle that you
found on Melissa's teeth.

35:55.710 --> 35:56.777
Do you have them?

35:56.811 --> 35:59.479
It's too soon to tell.

35:59.514 --> 36:00.747
But I'm fairly certain

36:00.782 --> 36:02.349
that I know
who Melissa's killer is,

36:02.383 --> 36:03.584
even without them.

36:03.618 --> 36:05.519
Yeah, well, me too, but...

36:05.553 --> 36:08.288
It was a rush to judgment, Jane,
but science is unbiased.

36:08.323 --> 36:10.557
The impression
made by this bite

36:10.592 --> 36:12.059
matches Melissa's
dental records.

36:12.093 --> 36:15.429
So the DNA results are
a formality at this point.

36:15.463 --> 36:17.965
- This man killed Melissa.
- Ray?

36:17.999 --> 36:20.400
Paddy Doyle was telling
the truth.

36:20.435 --> 36:22.469
Paddy Doyle runs those docks.

36:22.503 --> 36:24.838
All right? Ray just could have
been following orders --

36:24.873 --> 36:26.506
Your father's.

36:30.912 --> 36:33.580
It's Frost. He says he
has something big

36:33.700 --> 36:35.649
that we both need to see.

36:41.170 --> 36:42.522
What did you find?

36:42.642 --> 36:44.921
<i>Melissa hid this
behind her CD player.</i>

36:44.955 --> 36:46.990
It's not an amplifier.
It's a wireless receiver.

36:47.024 --> 36:49.592
So she was uploading
everything she recorded.

36:49.627 --> 36:51.261
Backing it up wirelessly.

36:51.295 --> 36:53.596
She was also recording onto
the SD card she swallowed.

36:53.631 --> 36:55.498
Frost, tell me there's footage.

36:55.533 --> 36:57.467
There is.

36:57.501 --> 36:59.436
40 years the Fed's been trying
to get Paddy and his gang on tape.

36:59.470 --> 37:00.970
Think a 22-year-old girl
got the job done?

37:04.442 --> 37:06.309
She's following Ray.

37:06.343 --> 37:08.378
The forensic evidence proves
that he killed her.

37:08.412 --> 37:10.313
Yeah, but it doesn't prove
that Paddy wasn't behind it.

37:10.347 --> 37:12.081
Ray's meeting somebody.

37:13.517 --> 37:14.717
That's a clear shot of Ray.

37:14.752 --> 37:16.553
Okay, now we just need one
of Paddy.

37:19.623 --> 37:22.158
- Frost, can you blow him up?
- I can try.

37:22.193 --> 37:24.761
<i>Get it done.
You screw this up...</i>

37:24.795 --> 37:26.529
Can you do anything
to the audio?

37:28.199 --> 37:30.633
<i>I'm not paying you
for nothing, okay?</i>

37:30.668 --> 37:32.535
<i>You push them faster.</i>

37:32.570 --> 37:35.472
<i>I don't give a damn
about safety regulations.</i>

37:35.506 --> 37:37.340
- <i>All right
- That's not his voice.</i>

37:37.374 --> 37:40.443
Is that Sutton?

37:40.478 --> 37:43.012
Yeah, looks like Ray ditched
the old mob for the new mob,

37:43.047 --> 37:44.614
the Corporation.

37:44.648 --> 37:46.216
But it's the same racket.

37:46.250 --> 37:47.817
Faster the dockworkers unload,

37:47.852 --> 37:50.220
the more ships they can get in,
the more money they make.

37:50.254 --> 37:52.121
- <i>Hey! What are you doing in here?!
- Get her!</i>

37:52.156 --> 37:55.291
It was Sutton.
Paddy was telling the truth.

37:55.326 --> 37:56.793
He didn't order
Melissa's death.

37:56.827 --> 37:58.561
I'm thinking Ray gave up
Sutton before he died.

37:58.596 --> 38:00.663
Then you'd better find Sutton
before my father does.

38:12.343 --> 38:14.477
Stand back.

38:19.750 --> 38:22.352
Sutton's office
is on the sixth floor.

38:22.386 --> 38:23.520
Elevator.

38:40.404 --> 38:42.238
Please help.

38:42.273 --> 38:44.240
Where's Doyle?

38:44.275 --> 38:45.775
I don't know!

38:45.809 --> 38:46.976
Frost, the stairs!

38:47.011 --> 38:48.378
I got it.

38:50.548 --> 38:52.348
Is there any other way
out of this place?

38:52.383 --> 38:54.817
- He told me I was gonna die slow.
- He's right.

38:54.852 --> 38:57.186
You will, in jail for the rest
of your miserable life.

38:57.221 --> 39:00.356
It's a private elevator.
Damn it!

39:06.196 --> 39:09.165
Damn, he's getting away again.

39:09.199 --> 39:10.466
He's gone.

39:10.501 --> 39:11.868
At least we got our bad guy.

39:11.902 --> 39:13.336
Yeah, one of them.

39:13.370 --> 39:15.805
I'll put out a BOLO.

39:24.815 --> 39:28.785
Hey, ma.
How was your trip?

39:28.819 --> 39:31.854
Oh, I lost 85 bucks
on the nickel slots.

39:31.889 --> 39:35.425
But look at all this
really great stuff I got.

39:35.459 --> 39:37.694
Hey! Anybody need a robe?

39:37.728 --> 39:41.397
Ma...Did you take this
from the little fridge?

39:41.432 --> 39:43.266
They refill it, Jane.

39:43.300 --> 39:45.468
This isn't free, ma. They're
gonna charge your credit card.

39:45.502 --> 39:48.905
I paid $109 a night
for that room.

39:50.341 --> 39:53.443
Really? I'm gonna send it back.

39:53.477 --> 39:57.280
Four hours
of sensitivity training,

39:57.314 --> 39:59.182
and I passed
with flying colors.

39:59.216 --> 40:01.351
- Congratulations.
- Did you learn anything?

40:01.385 --> 40:04.587
Yes. I am an equal-opportunity
offender.

40:04.622 --> 40:07.357
Okay, are they gonna
charge me for this?

40:10.894 --> 40:11.894
Hello?

40:11.929 --> 40:13.262
Detective Rizzoli.

40:13.297 --> 40:14.764
How did you get this number?

40:14.798 --> 40:17.533
I'm one of the good guys
compared to this new way

40:17.568 --> 40:18.868
of doing business.

40:18.902 --> 40:20.603
I know you know that.

40:20.638 --> 40:23.473
I'm not sure I do.
Where are you?

40:23.507 --> 40:24.741
You know I'm not telling you.

40:24.775 --> 40:26.275
Well, that's too bad.

40:26.310 --> 40:28.511
Why don't you tell me
about Melissa Joy Black?

40:28.545 --> 40:31.481
Back when I ran the docks,
we didn't kill women...

40:31.515 --> 40:35.385
Or hurt hardworking people
like her father, Richie.

40:35.419 --> 40:37.320
Well, that was ruled
an accident.

40:37.354 --> 40:38.755
Yeah.

40:38.789 --> 40:41.658
Check the DNA on
the blood alcohol test

40:41.692 --> 40:44.694
they said was Richie's.

40:44.728 --> 40:46.796
Take care of my daughter.

40:46.830 --> 40:48.865
I can take care of myself.

40:48.899 --> 40:50.867
Hang up.

40:56.840 --> 40:59.208
I do think he loves you.

40:59.243 --> 41:02.612
It doesn't mean
I have to love him back.

41:04.448 --> 41:08.785
Oh! What happened
to the door?!

41:09.620 --> 41:11.387
Tommy forgot his keys.

41:11.422 --> 41:14.357
Tommy, you know
better than that.

41:14.391 --> 41:16.492
Oh.

41:16.527 --> 41:17.994
I make a suggestion?

41:21.465 --> 41:22.865
Checkmate.

41:22.900 --> 41:24.701
What -- you know
how to play chess?

41:24.735 --> 41:27.370
Yeah, who do you
think taught him?

41:27.404 --> 41:30.606
Tommy's not the only Rizzoli
with a beautiful mind.
