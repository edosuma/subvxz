WEBVTT

00:10.378 --> 00:12.346
( heart pounding )

00:17.218 --> 00:18.519
( sighs )

00:24.825 --> 00:27.195
( heartbeat continues )

00:41.709 --> 00:45.413
( steady breathing )

00:51.352 --> 00:54.054
( heartbeat quickens )

01:12.340 --> 01:13.241
We have an ID
on this one?

01:13.274 --> 01:15.243
Mark Herlan, 39.

01:15.276 --> 01:17.711
A single medium-caliber
rifle round to the chest.

01:31.392 --> 01:33.527
Any witnesses?

01:33.561 --> 01:36.197
Lady gardening,
mom with her kid.

01:36.230 --> 01:38.332
Neither one
heard the shot.

01:38.366 --> 01:40.334
I'm pulling some uniforms
to canvass the neighborhood,

01:40.368 --> 01:43.371
to see if we can get a lock
on where the shot came from.

01:43.404 --> 01:45.173
I don't think that's
going to be necessary.

01:45.206 --> 01:46.340
These numbers--

01:46.374 --> 01:48.142
size of the wound,
angle of entry,

01:48.176 --> 01:49.777
position of the body--

01:49.810 --> 01:51.612
they already tell you
what you need to know.

01:51.645 --> 01:54.782
See, ballistic trajectories
are fundamentally simple.

01:54.815 --> 01:57.185
They're the result of only
two physical forces:

01:57.218 --> 01:58.619
vertical and
horizontal velocity.

01:58.652 --> 02:00.821
Calculating trajectories
with precision

02:00.854 --> 02:03.424
requires taking into account
many variables:

02:03.457 --> 02:05.459
wind speed and direction,

02:05.493 --> 02:07.361
atmospheric pressure,
temperature, humidity,

02:07.395 --> 02:10.331
inclination of gun,
density of the projectile.

02:17.405 --> 02:18.806
calculations some rough

02:18.839 --> 02:20.474
of trajectory models

02:20.508 --> 02:22.243
based on the bullet's
angle of impact,

02:22.276 --> 02:23.411
wind speed and direction.

02:23.444 --> 02:24.778
I approximate
that our sniper

02:24.812 --> 02:26.880
fired from right
around here.

02:26.914 --> 02:28.782
- This spot here. See?
- Uh-huh.

02:28.816 --> 02:30.918
Actually, it was
more like here.

02:33.454 --> 02:34.855
Ah, Agent Edgerton.

02:34.888 --> 02:36.590
Bureau told you
I was coming?

02:36.624 --> 02:37.958
Yeah. I'm the one
who requested you.

02:37.991 --> 02:40.394
Thanks for coming.
He's a sniper instructor

02:40.428 --> 02:42.230
from Quantico.

02:44.232 --> 02:46.166
Needed a different perspective.

02:48.502 --> 02:50.538
What makes you think
he fired from your location?

02:50.571 --> 02:53.774
Well, your location
assumes he's a good shot.

02:53.807 --> 02:56.310
I say he's just an okay shot
who got lucky.

02:56.344 --> 02:58.346
What kind of
empirical evidence

02:58.379 --> 02:59.880
are you basing
that assumption on?

03:01.782 --> 03:02.983
300-yard plink,

03:03.016 --> 03:05.453
and he goes for center mass,
torso shot.

03:05.486 --> 03:06.920
Good sniper bothers
to get this close,

03:06.954 --> 03:10.924
it's to spread a man's brains
across the sidewalk.

03:10.958 --> 03:16.364
Oh, yeah, and, uh,
there's this, too.

03:16.397 --> 03:18.532
See how the grass is burned
from the muzzle flash?

03:18.566 --> 03:20.334
This waffling
in the dirt?

03:20.368 --> 03:22.403
Right. Like he used something
for support, right?

03:22.436 --> 03:24.638
Yeah, I'm thinking
a duffel or his jacket.

03:24.672 --> 03:26.340
But yours was a
good guess, too.

03:26.374 --> 03:28.409
Wasn't a guess;
it was more of an estimate.

03:28.442 --> 03:29.610
Anything else?

03:29.643 --> 03:31.579
Yeah, he's gonna do it again.

03:31.612 --> 03:33.847
How do you know that?

03:33.881 --> 03:35.483
Thing about snipers?

03:35.516 --> 03:37.451
We love it.

03:37.485 --> 03:39.520
And that's not a guess, either;
it's a fact.

03:45.493 --> 03:46.994
We all use math every day...

03:47.020 --> 03:49.320
to predict weather...

03:49.390 --> 03:51.900
to tell time...

03:51.930 --> 03:53.900
( echoes ):
to handle money...

03:55.460 --> 03:58.370
Math is more than
formulas and equations.

03:59.720 --> 04:01.100
It's logic.

04:01.160 --> 04:02.980
Math is more than
formulas and equations.

04:03.080 --> 04:04.460
It's rationality.

04:05.460 --> 04:09.450
It's using your mind to solve
the biggest mysteries we know.

04:16.190 --> 04:18.320
DON: Okay, let me have your
attention, please.

04:18.360 --> 04:19.460
Listen up...
LAPD is running

04:19.490 --> 04:22.530
a parallel task force
with full information sharing.

04:22.560 --> 04:24.590
So no theory goes
unchecked, right?

04:24.630 --> 04:26.000
No tip ignored.

04:26.030 --> 04:28.770
Four killings...
What they have in common:

04:28.800 --> 04:30.670
single shots fired
from mid-caliber rifles

04:30.700 --> 04:32.470
at a distance of 200 yards
or greater.

04:32.500 --> 04:34.270
What they don't have in common
are the victims.

04:34.300 --> 04:37.010
We have a real-estate broker,
a housewife,

04:37.040 --> 04:38.640
a high school student
and a mailman.

04:38.680 --> 04:41.350
Now the locations vary,
the times of day vary. Every...

04:41.380 --> 04:43.450
Ballistics confirms
that the four bullets

04:43.480 --> 04:45.220
came from four
different rifles.

04:45.250 --> 04:46.420
Four shots, four kills...

04:46.450 --> 04:49.350
that kind of skill suggests
a possible military background.

04:49.390 --> 04:51.660
What it suggests is that
he knows his limitations enough

04:51.690 --> 04:53.020
to remain within them.

04:53.060 --> 04:54.720
This is Special Agent Edgerton

04:54.760 --> 04:56.390
from Quantico,
and he doesn't think

04:56.430 --> 04:59.500
our shooter is
especially skilled.

04:59.530 --> 05:01.170
Your housewife there

05:01.200 --> 05:03.030
caught a 7.62 x 39 round.

05:03.070 --> 05:05.470
He could've found
a Russian SKS to do that job

05:05.500 --> 05:06.740
for less than a hundred bucks.

05:06.770 --> 05:09.270
Or maybe he's
using a Blaser R93;

05:09.310 --> 05:10.440
that particular
weapon

05:10.470 --> 05:13.440
has interchangeable barrels
in 17 different calibers.

05:13.480 --> 05:15.150
So he could be swapping barrels
after every kill,

05:15.180 --> 05:16.810
which would change the ballistic
fingerprint, right?

05:16.850 --> 05:19.420
Be a pretty cheap way
to avoid being linked

05:19.450 --> 05:21.550
to all of your murders.

05:21.590 --> 05:22.690
LAPD Canvass turned up
a FedEx driver.

05:22.720 --> 05:25.260
He remembers seeing a green
Jeep parked in the field

05:25.290 --> 05:26.420
around the time
of the shooting.

05:26.460 --> 05:29.260
AMITA: Apparently there's large
performance differentials

05:29.290 --> 05:32.400
between same-caliber bullets
from different manufacturers.

05:32.430 --> 05:34.430
Based on what?

05:34.460 --> 05:37.530
Lead composition,
gunpowder packing...

05:37.570 --> 05:39.770
Just what I need:
more variables.

05:39.800 --> 05:41.410
( knocking on door )

05:41.440 --> 05:42.840
Oh...

05:42.870 --> 05:46.980
Some assistance in my brazen
attack on the Lorenz invariance?

05:47.040 --> 05:48.880
No, drag coefficient models.

05:49.040 --> 05:51.510
Drag co... drag on what?

05:51.550 --> 05:53.280
Bullets.

05:53.320 --> 05:55.420
Bullets as in ballistic
trajectories

05:55.450 --> 05:57.420
defined by the Einstein
Equivalence Principle,

05:57.450 --> 05:59.560
related to
the Lorenz frame?

05:59.590 --> 06:02.390
As in, bullets
that kill people.

06:02.430 --> 06:03.560
Oh.

06:03.590 --> 06:04.590
There seems to be

06:04.630 --> 06:07.730
some disagreements
over the sniper's expertise.

06:07.760 --> 06:10.330
LARRY: I'd say the public's
decided on the question.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.500
I have an aunt who lives two
blocks from the first shooting.

06:12.540 --> 06:14.470
She's afraid to go out
on her front lawn now.

06:14.500 --> 06:16.470
Why don't you tell your aunt
that statistically

06:16.510 --> 06:18.140
she has a better chance
of being mauled by a bear.

06:18.170 --> 06:19.810
Actually, statistics
would favor

06:19.840 --> 06:21.610
the bear being mauled
by my aunt, but...

06:21.640 --> 06:23.310
( chuckles )

06:23.350 --> 06:24.550
This fear, this extends beyond

06:24.580 --> 06:27.450
the reach of statistics,
Charles.

06:27.480 --> 06:31.820
No, this is about arbitrary,
inescapable death.

06:31.850 --> 06:34.490
No, times
like these,

06:34.520 --> 06:35.790
you just wind up speculating

06:35.820 --> 06:39.500
on paths not taken,
jobs left undone.

06:39.530 --> 06:40.800
Larry, I...

06:40.830 --> 06:42.730
I'm trying to get those
equations done for you

06:42.770 --> 06:44.270
as soon as I can...

06:44.300 --> 06:46.800
No, no no. At that moment,
I was actually thinking

06:46.840 --> 06:49.140
of a far more
prosaic legacy.

06:49.170 --> 06:51.240
Someone to carry on
the Fleinhardt standard.

06:54.480 --> 06:55.810
I didn't know
you wanted kids, Larry.

06:55.840 --> 07:01.180
Well... children are wormholes.

07:01.220 --> 07:02.350
Wormholes?

07:02.390 --> 07:03.320
Yeah.

07:03.350 --> 07:06.490
They're portals into
the unreachable future

07:06.520 --> 07:07.760
and unattainable past.

07:07.790 --> 07:10.290
No, as things
stand now,

07:10.330 --> 07:13.630
they exist only
in the theoretical realm, so...

07:13.660 --> 07:15.660
Well, I can see where
you might have some trouble

07:15.700 --> 07:18.230
selling a woman on the idea
of "carrying your wormhole."

07:18.270 --> 07:20.940
( chuckles )

07:20.970 --> 07:23.610
I accessed traffic cameras
for a ten-block radius

07:23.640 --> 07:24.740
where the mailman got hit.

07:24.770 --> 07:25.810
Good.
Found this.

07:27.380 --> 07:30.350
Take a look.
Jeep is registered

07:30.380 --> 07:31.710
to one Wayne Osborne.

07:31.750 --> 07:33.550
Rap sheet goes back
to Idaho.

07:33.580 --> 07:35.850
Assault, drug possession,
weapons violations.

07:35.880 --> 07:37.650
Yeah, check this out.
Affiliations with

07:37.690 --> 07:40.220
the Green Lightning
white supremacist group.

07:40.260 --> 07:43.230
They're on the ATF watch list
for illegal arms dealings.

07:43.260 --> 07:45.590
Yeah, Mr. Osbourne sounds like
a good candidate.

07:48.330 --> 07:49.370
FBI! Warrant!

07:49.400 --> 07:50.570
FBI!

07:50.600 --> 07:51.630
FBI!

07:51.670 --> 07:52.640
Hands on the table!

07:52.670 --> 07:53.600
FBI!

07:53.640 --> 07:54.970
FBI!

07:55.000 --> 07:56.940
Hands on the table!

07:56.970 --> 07:57.910
Clear!

07:57.940 --> 07:59.280
Clear back here.

07:59.310 --> 08:01.310
- Clear here!
- He's not here, Don.

08:01.340 --> 08:02.480
All right, where's Osborne?

08:02.510 --> 08:03.580
- Out.
- Out where?

08:03.610 --> 08:04.880
Some friends.
I don't know.

08:04.910 --> 08:06.480
Look, let me tell
you something.

08:06.520 --> 08:08.480
If you don't want to face
the death penalty with your

08:08.520 --> 08:10.520
boyfriend, you better
think harder and think fast.

08:10.550 --> 08:12.220
He took my pick-up
about two hours ago.

08:12.260 --> 08:14.220
But I swear, I don't know
where he went.

08:14.260 --> 08:15.760
- What color's the pick-up?
- It's blue.

08:15.790 --> 08:16.530
Get the plates.

08:16.560 --> 08:18.530
Notify LAPD
and every agency.

08:18.560 --> 08:20.460
My guess is he's out there
trolling for more victims.

08:20.500 --> 08:21.560
DAVID:
Don.

08:21.600 --> 08:22.630
Take a look.

08:28.670 --> 08:30.410
Oh, yeah.

08:38.810 --> 08:40.280
You know, Stan Carter's

08:40.320 --> 08:41.920
working for the LA
Parks Department now.

08:41.950 --> 08:43.020
Oh, yeah,
I remember him.

08:43.050 --> 08:44.290
Stan. Stan the Man.

08:44.320 --> 08:45.390
He used to work with you

08:45.420 --> 08:46.690
on the city planning
board, right?

08:46.720 --> 08:47.620
Yeah.
Yeah.

08:47.660 --> 08:49.630
He's looking for a
part-time consultant.

08:49.660 --> 08:51.690
And since you two are
in and out all the time,

08:51.730 --> 08:53.030
I figured I...
( cell phone rings )

08:53.060 --> 08:54.530
Hold on a second.

08:54.560 --> 08:57.570
Hello?

08:57.600 --> 08:59.540
Okay.

08:59.570 --> 09:00.570
All right, yeah.

09:00.600 --> 09:01.840
I'll be right there.

09:01.870 --> 09:03.440
Sure.

09:03.470 --> 09:05.670
They're pretty sure
it's the sniper again.

09:05.710 --> 09:06.880
David's picking me up
out front

09:06.910 --> 09:08.040
on the way to the scene.

09:08.080 --> 09:09.810
The scene? What scene?

09:09.850 --> 09:11.650
You mean the crime scene?

09:11.680 --> 09:14.980
Exposure to actual events
helps my statistical modeling.

09:15.020 --> 09:16.990
I know, but it's the exposure
that I'm worried about.

09:17.020 --> 09:18.650
Come on, there's
a crazy guy out there

09:18.690 --> 09:19.720
still shooting people.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.590
Now what if he returns
to the scene of the crime,

09:21.620 --> 09:22.790
you know, like those arsonists
do?

09:22.830 --> 09:23.790
He hasn't.

09:23.830 --> 09:24.830
No, not yet.

09:24.860 --> 09:27.030
Dad, there are
a dozen FBI agents

09:27.060 --> 09:29.000
and police officers
at these scenes.

09:29.030 --> 09:31.470
I mean, if I were in
any real danger,

09:31.500 --> 09:33.870
Don wouldn't let me go.

09:33.900 --> 09:35.400
You know that.

09:36.370 --> 09:37.540
Don't worry.

09:47.650 --> 09:50.450
Felt like someone hit me
in the shoulder with a hammer.

09:50.490 --> 09:53.590
Then Steve saw the blood,
and everyone started screaming.

09:53.620 --> 09:55.790
Neither one of you saw
where the shot came from?

09:55.820 --> 09:57.760
Do you remember seeing

09:57.790 --> 09:59.030
a blue pick-up

09:59.060 --> 10:00.330
at any point?

10:00.360 --> 10:01.530
I'm sorry, I...

10:01.560 --> 10:04.700
There must have been 50 people
coming out of the theater.

10:04.730 --> 10:05.800
Why me?

10:05.830 --> 10:06.660
It's okay.

10:06.760 --> 10:08.180
You're going
to be okay.

10:08.600 --> 10:09.760
Thank you.

10:11.810 --> 10:12.880
She's right.

10:12.910 --> 10:14.380
Why her?

10:14.410 --> 10:15.680
Maybe Osborne's

10:15.710 --> 10:16.980
playing out a power trip,

10:17.010 --> 10:18.950
choosing his victims
arbitrarily.

10:18.980 --> 10:21.350
Maybe it's a political
statement.

10:21.380 --> 10:23.690
No, domestic terrorism usually
involves a public statement.

10:23.720 --> 10:25.690
He has been
conspicuously silent.

10:25.720 --> 10:27.490
Yeah, I don't think
he's gonna stay silent.

10:27.520 --> 10:28.560
Come on.

10:39.540 --> 10:41.700
EDGERTON:
Hello there, Professor.

10:41.740 --> 10:43.810
Still figuring
the angles?

10:43.840 --> 10:46.040
What I'm figuring is
the reason why he missed.

10:46.070 --> 10:48.980
This shot is way closer
than any of the others.

10:49.010 --> 10:50.950
Well, closer doesn't
mean easier.

10:50.980 --> 10:53.550
He ran a higher risk
of being seen here.

10:53.580 --> 10:56.920
Well, that wouldn't affect the
shot itself, though, would it?

10:56.950 --> 11:00.020
Forget about the math
for a second.

11:00.060 --> 11:02.630
Just look.

11:08.560 --> 11:10.530
Try to think
like he does.

11:10.570 --> 11:14.540
Invisibility is
a sniper's greatest strength.

11:14.570 --> 11:16.670
If he starts to worry
about losing it,

11:16.710 --> 11:18.570
his heart rate increases.

11:18.610 --> 11:20.580
If he doesn't know
how to handle it,

11:20.610 --> 11:22.680
his breathing rhythm
gets thrown off.

11:22.710 --> 11:23.780
Breathing rhythm?

11:26.750 --> 11:29.790
You've really never
fired a gun?

11:31.220 --> 11:33.020
I don't really believe in them.

11:33.060 --> 11:34.720
Believe in them?
It's not like they're ghosts.

11:34.760 --> 11:36.630
Obviously,
that's not what I meant.

11:36.660 --> 11:37.890
So you don't take
into account

11:37.930 --> 11:39.600
sweat getting
into his eyes

11:39.630 --> 11:41.700
or his hands cramping up
or adrenaline

11:41.730 --> 11:42.970
twitching the barrel?

11:43.000 --> 11:44.870
That's the difference
between

11:44.900 --> 11:46.840
an expert marksman and
a guy who aims at white meat

11:46.870 --> 11:48.040
and goes home with a wing.

11:48.070 --> 11:49.940
A woman got shot today...

11:49.970 --> 11:52.170
not some animal.

11:52.210 --> 11:55.040
I see. So when I regard her
as a technical problem,

11:55.080 --> 11:58.210
I'm a sick bastard, but when you
plug her in to an equation,

11:58.250 --> 11:59.850
you're a scientist?

11:59.880 --> 12:01.850
It just seems like it's all
some kind of sport to you.

12:01.880 --> 12:05.750
It's my job to put my head
inside the mind of a killer.

12:07.790 --> 12:09.090
Your brother's, too.

12:14.030 --> 12:15.960
You coming?

12:21.170 --> 12:22.810
The pattern of
these shootings

12:22.840 --> 12:24.110
doesn't work with
my existing equations.

12:24.140 --> 12:25.310
So change the equations.

12:25.340 --> 12:27.080
You know, I'm starting to think
my whole approach is wrong,

12:27.110 --> 12:29.750
like there's a design
in there somewhere

12:29.780 --> 12:31.910
but not usually
where we look for it.

12:33.820 --> 12:35.180
Hey.

12:35.220 --> 12:36.850
Don just picked up Osborne.

12:36.890 --> 12:38.690
- Where?
- Los Feliz.

12:38.720 --> 12:39.620
What about a weapon?

12:39.660 --> 12:41.620
Preliminary ballistics
matches his rifle

12:41.660 --> 12:43.830
to the mailman's slaying.

12:43.860 --> 12:45.690
- Doesn't fit, though.
- What's wrong?

12:45.730 --> 12:47.860
Osborne spent the entire
afternoon in a bar.

12:47.900 --> 12:49.900
- A dozen witnesses.
- Well, that's not possible,

12:49.930 --> 12:52.770
because this happened, like,
less than three hours ago.

12:52.800 --> 12:54.040
Unless Osborne
isn't the shooter.

12:54.070 --> 12:57.610
We've got two snipers.

13:07.250 --> 13:10.190
I don't recognize the authority
of the federal government.

13:10.220 --> 13:13.020
TERRY: Well, the federal
government sure recognizes you.

13:13.060 --> 13:15.660
We have you cold for
the murder of Mark Herlan.

13:15.690 --> 13:18.930
Ballistics, tire tracks,
foot molds.

13:18.960 --> 13:21.760
Herlan was a slave
of the federal welfare system

13:21.800 --> 13:23.200
disguised as civil service.

13:23.230 --> 13:24.770
Whatever happened to him,

13:24.800 --> 13:29.140
whoever killed him, they
were doing society a favor.

13:29.170 --> 13:30.570
TERRY:
The new girlfriend

13:30.610 --> 13:32.010
in your trailer filled us in.

13:32.040 --> 13:34.680
You shot Herlan because
he was about to marry your ex.

13:34.710 --> 13:36.040
Don't... move.

13:36.080 --> 13:37.750
This was a personal
killing for you.

13:37.780 --> 13:38.910
You wanted revenge.

13:38.950 --> 13:41.220
You know,
it was almost clever.

13:41.250 --> 13:43.620
Your buddies in Green Lightning
start a terror campaign,

13:43.650 --> 13:45.220
shooting people
at random--

13:45.250 --> 13:46.420
you decide to piggyback.

13:46.450 --> 13:49.160
You think the Green Lightning
is behind these shootings?

13:49.190 --> 13:51.230
DAVID: When we start
bringing your pals in,

13:51.260 --> 13:53.260
we think it's gonna
be a race to see

13:53.300 --> 13:54.930
who can cut a deal the fastest.

13:54.960 --> 13:56.600
You're first man in, Wayne.

13:56.630 --> 13:59.200
My advice would be
to take advantage of it.

13:59.230 --> 14:01.270
An act of terrorism carries
a federal death penalty.

14:01.300 --> 14:03.310
Or maybe you haven't heard
of Timothy McVeigh.

14:03.340 --> 14:08.140
( laughs ):
You know... you people...

14:08.180 --> 14:12.680
you really have to start
talking to each other.

14:12.720 --> 14:16.020
( laughing )

14:20.720 --> 14:24.060
Osborne's been an ATF informant
against his supremacist buddies

14:24.090 --> 14:25.590
for over six months.

14:25.630 --> 14:28.160
Well, thanks, ATF,
for the information sharing,

14:28.200 --> 14:30.730
and there goes
our conspiracy theory.

14:30.770 --> 14:32.870
He also has an alibi
for every other shooting.

14:32.900 --> 14:34.740
I'll go tell Charlie.
I mean, maybe he can find

14:34.770 --> 14:36.770
the pattern if he gets rid
of the Osborne shooting.

14:40.680 --> 14:42.810
LARRY:
You know, I have had

14:42.850 --> 14:47.120
almost no attendance
at my morning classes.

14:47.150 --> 14:48.950
It's like everyone's afraid
to set foot outside.

14:48.980 --> 14:51.250
Not everybody.

14:51.290 --> 14:55.090
Yeah. In times
like these,

14:55.120 --> 14:57.630
an empty house
is not a home.

15:00.360 --> 15:02.770
Evaluating my
immediate prospects

15:02.800 --> 15:05.100
for a conventional
nuclear family,

15:05.130 --> 15:07.100
I've just now begun
to consider adoption.

15:07.140 --> 15:09.040
How long have you
been considering it?

15:09.070 --> 15:10.810
Three days.

15:10.840 --> 15:12.710
Give it a few more days.

15:12.740 --> 15:14.180
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

15:14.210 --> 15:18.080
So what, you found
a pattern yet?

15:18.110 --> 15:21.150
More like a pattern
of patternlessness.

15:21.180 --> 15:24.050
Hey, there's an interesting
metaphysical notion.

15:24.090 --> 15:27.090
Well, perhaps a human element
remains to be inserted.

15:27.120 --> 15:28.320
( groans )

15:28.360 --> 15:31.130
You sound like this, uh,

15:31.160 --> 15:33.100
Agent Edgerton guy.

15:33.130 --> 15:34.930
He's a sniper instructor
that Don brought in

15:34.960 --> 15:36.300
from Quantico, he thinks I
should be out shooting rifles.

15:36.330 --> 15:38.430
Well, why aren't you?

15:38.470 --> 15:40.370
It's a poor allocation
of my time.

15:40.400 --> 15:43.240
In the time it takes
to shoot X number of rifles,

15:43.270 --> 15:45.740
I can access ten
or 20 or a hundred times

15:45.780 --> 15:46.980
that amount of data.

15:47.010 --> 15:49.910
No, no, no, no-- there's data
and there's hands-on experience.

15:49.950 --> 15:51.050
These are two different beasts.

15:51.080 --> 15:53.780
That's why you've got
blackboards and laboratories.

15:53.820 --> 15:55.020
You study the universe,

15:55.050 --> 15:56.950
and you've never been
to outer space.

15:56.990 --> 15:59.220
Yeah, but if I had
the opportunity,

15:59.260 --> 16:01.760
do you think for a moment
I'd hesitate?

16:04.260 --> 16:06.960
BROADCASTER: ...in the wake of a
fatal shooting yesterday,

16:07.000 --> 16:08.230
bringing the total
to six victims

16:08.270 --> 16:09.470
the LA sniper has murdered.

16:09.500 --> 16:12.370
The LAPD and the FBI are urging
residents to avoid unnecessary

16:12.400 --> 16:15.240
outdoor activity and to report
any suspicious activity...

16:15.270 --> 16:17.010
( broadcast stops )

16:18.040 --> 16:20.180
DAVID: Reminds me of
snow days back home.

16:20.210 --> 16:24.210
School shuts down,
everybody stays home.

16:24.250 --> 16:26.180
Except nobody's
having any fun.

16:26.220 --> 16:27.960
Yeah.

16:29.190 --> 16:31.790
I called my ex-husband
this morning.

16:32.890 --> 16:33.880
Yeah?

16:34.020 --> 16:34.860
Yeah.

16:35.540 --> 16:38.130
No real reason--
the thought just occurred to me,

16:38.160 --> 16:39.500
what if I never got another
chance to talk to him?

16:39.530 --> 16:42.170
How'd that go?

16:42.200 --> 16:44.030
We got in a fight.

16:44.070 --> 16:45.800
( laughs )

16:48.070 --> 16:49.010
People have a greater chance

16:49.040 --> 16:51.170
of getting into
a car accident, you know.

16:51.210 --> 16:52.240
That doesn't
keep us home.

16:52.280 --> 16:55.010
Because it's a danger
we've already assimilated

16:55.040 --> 16:56.180
into our daily lives.

16:56.210 --> 16:57.810
The sniper's something new.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.880
It's random, malicious.

16:59.920 --> 17:03.350
A bullet that can come from
anywhere, take anyone, you know?

17:03.390 --> 17:07.390
- Wow.
- Yeah.

17:07.420 --> 17:09.460
( sight clicking,
barrel pumping, shot firing)

17:09.490 --> 17:12.200
Thanks for bringing lunch
all the way down here.

17:12.230 --> 17:13.530
- Come on, this way.
- Oh.

17:13.560 --> 17:16.100
Well, you know,
the drive was a pleasure.

17:16.130 --> 17:18.270
Traffic on the 10
has never been thinner

17:18.300 --> 17:20.870
since, uh, well,
since it's been the 10.

17:20.900 --> 17:23.070
Yeah, it's like all L.A.'s in
lockdown, huh? A little eerie.

17:23.110 --> 17:25.040
- Right in here.
- Yeah.

17:25.070 --> 17:29.850
So, how, uh... how are you and
Charlie managing this case?

17:29.880 --> 17:32.380
Well, I mean, he's frustrated;
I'm frustrated.

17:32.420 --> 17:35.280
I mean, we're having
a rough time on this.

17:35.320 --> 17:38.960
Is that why he's been running
out of the house late at night?

17:38.990 --> 17:41.120
We got an agent on him
all the time.

17:41.160 --> 17:42.990
I mean, I know he's
been helping you out

17:43.030 --> 17:45.090
and that he comes down
to your office a lot,

17:45.130 --> 17:46.200
and I-I think
that's great.

17:46.230 --> 17:49.430
But... but now you got him going
out on crime scenes...

17:49.470 --> 17:51.460
I mean, there's this guy
shooting people out there.

17:51.540 --> 17:53.540
Dad, you really think I would
put Charlie in danger?

17:53.560 --> 17:54.940
think?u know what I really

17:54.960 --> 17:56.940
- What?
- I think you have to understand

17:56.980 --> 17:58.470
that Charlie can
never say no to you.

17:58.510 --> 18:01.480
I mean... I mean,
all you have to do is

18:01.510 --> 18:03.380
to ask him something,
and he's there for you.

18:03.520 --> 18:05.720
Yeah, and I'm there
for him.

18:05.880 --> 18:07.380
( sighs )

18:07.420 --> 18:09.220
Look, he's not a cop.

18:09.250 --> 18:11.220
Now, come on, I mean,
he's better off

18:11.250 --> 18:12.890
with chalk in his
hand than a gun.

18:12.920 --> 18:14.390
You got to stop this.

18:14.420 --> 18:16.190
He is a grown man,
and he's capable of...

18:16.230 --> 18:18.090
Who still seeks the approval
of his older brother,

18:18.130 --> 18:20.460
whether his older brother
likes it or not.

18:20.500 --> 18:21.580
( phone rings )

18:21.620 --> 18:22.660
Excuse me.

18:23.560 --> 18:25.430
Eppes.

18:25.470 --> 18:28.100
Yeah. Right.
I'll meet you downstairs.

18:28.140 --> 18:30.140
Got to go.
Another shooting.

18:30.170 --> 18:31.470
Oh, my God.

18:31.510 --> 18:33.410
Yeah. I promise
I won't call Charlie

18:33.440 --> 18:34.540
till we roll
the tanks out.

18:34.580 --> 18:37.010
And I want you to stay here
until I call you, okay?

18:37.050 --> 18:39.450
All right, thanks
for the sandwich.

18:43.150 --> 18:45.250
DAVID:
Thank you, Tom.

18:46.540 --> 18:49.330
John Doe, late 40s
early 50s.

18:49.360 --> 18:50.290
Homeless,

18:50.330 --> 18:51.930
from the looks of it.

18:51.960 --> 18:53.260
No place to hide.

18:53.300 --> 18:55.430
Maybe he hadn't heard
the news yet.

18:55.460 --> 18:57.870
This place is usually packed
around this time of day.

18:57.900 --> 19:00.200
EDGERTON: Well, the mailman
murder, I wasn't impressed.

19:00.240 --> 19:03.010
This is one I am.

19:03.040 --> 19:04.370
Why?

19:04.410 --> 19:06.410
What you just said-- the
street is usually crowded,

19:06.440 --> 19:09.050
and yet with no one around he
was able to conceal himself,

19:09.080 --> 19:12.880
get off a kill shot and
then get out undetected.

19:12.920 --> 19:14.450
You know, Charlie
and I disagreed

19:14.480 --> 19:17.320
about the proficiency
of some of the shootings.

19:17.350 --> 19:20.390
I'm thinking now maybe
I'm the one who was wrong.

19:28.230 --> 19:30.330
AMITA:
What are we looking at?

19:30.370 --> 19:32.600
CHARLIE:
A nonfunctioning algorithm

19:32.640 --> 19:34.570
based on seven
sniper attacks,

19:34.600 --> 19:36.970
all presumably
part of a pattern.

19:37.010 --> 19:39.040
But you can't find the pattern?

19:39.080 --> 19:41.950
I can't define the pattern;
I know it's there.

19:41.980 --> 19:44.480
Shooting number four
was a copycat.

19:44.510 --> 19:46.680
The mailman killed
by Wayne Osborne.

19:46.720 --> 19:48.650
Right.

19:48.680 --> 19:50.420
I removed it
from the calculation,

19:50.450 --> 19:52.560
which should have brought me
closer to the answer.

19:52.590 --> 19:53.620
Well, it makes sense.

19:53.660 --> 19:57.090
Get rid of the corrupt data
to improve the fit.

19:57.130 --> 19:59.360
But instead
of improving the fit,

19:59.400 --> 20:03.570
it's as if the bad data were
clarifying some new pattern.

20:03.600 --> 20:06.570
Which, by definition,
wouldn't make it bad data.

20:29.930 --> 20:31.500
Here are the shootings,

20:31.530 --> 20:33.800
graphed according
to a function of time,

20:33.830 --> 20:36.530
method, victim
and ballistic characteristics.

20:36.570 --> 20:39.070
Now, when I added dimensions--
location,

20:39.100 --> 20:41.000
time of day-- and took slices,

20:41.040 --> 20:42.910
the points remained
truly random.

20:42.940 --> 20:44.940
However, when
I eliminated dimensions

20:44.970 --> 20:49.210
and broke it down to a graph
of a simple function of time...

20:49.250 --> 20:53.920
...as you can see, the beginning
of an exponential curve.

20:53.950 --> 20:55.590
The sniper attacks
are increasing in frequency.

20:55.620 --> 20:58.250
The logical conclusion.
Except...

20:58.290 --> 21:03.130
this... is Wayne Osborne
shooting Mark Herlan,

21:03.160 --> 21:04.860
which we know
is a copycat murder.

21:04.890 --> 21:05.930
So I took it out

21:05.960 --> 21:07.060
of my calculations.

21:07.100 --> 21:08.730
However, when I put it back in,

21:08.770 --> 21:10.000
it fell perfectly on the line.

21:10.030 --> 21:12.270
So that's either
a stunning coincidence

21:12.300 --> 21:14.500
or evidence
of a different pattern.

21:14.540 --> 21:16.870
I don't believe
you have one serial sniper

21:16.910 --> 21:18.170
and one copycat.

21:18.210 --> 21:19.840
You have an epidemic

21:19.880 --> 21:22.150
of copycat snipers.

21:22.180 --> 21:23.680
Wait a minute, h-hold on.

21:23.710 --> 21:25.080
Uh, is that even possible?

21:25.110 --> 21:26.120
TERRY:
Viral behavior.

21:26.150 --> 21:28.790
Malcolm Gladwell's notion
of a Tipping Point.

21:28.820 --> 21:30.590
Ideas and trends,
what's in,

21:30.620 --> 21:31.820
what's not--
it's really just

21:31.860 --> 21:33.520
human behavior
spreading infectiously.

21:33.560 --> 21:34.560
- Like a virus.
- Uh-huh.

21:34.590 --> 21:35.860
Like a virus.
That's right.

21:35.890 --> 21:37.760
Oh, consider a neighborhood

21:37.790 --> 21:40.160
where all the houses
are painted white.

21:40.200 --> 21:44.230
And one day, one guy decides
to paint his house blue.

21:44.270 --> 21:47.100
The next day his neighbor walks
by, sees that color and says,

21:47.140 --> 21:49.670
"Hey, I like that color--- I'm
gonna paint my house blue."

21:49.710 --> 21:53.640
And let's say that influences
two more people each time.

21:53.680 --> 21:55.750
Now, even if people
get sick of the color blue

21:55.780 --> 21:57.050
and decide to repaint

21:57.080 --> 21:59.550
their houses white, the blue
trend will still grow.

21:59.580 --> 22:02.590
And now you have an epidemic
of houses being painted blue

22:02.620 --> 22:04.820
faster than
they're being repainted white.

22:04.850 --> 22:07.620
Wayne Osborne wants to kill
his ex-wife's new fiancé.

22:07.660 --> 22:09.330
Last week
he would have stabbed him,

22:09.360 --> 22:11.330
he would have run him over
with a car.

22:11.360 --> 22:12.960
Right, but he watches the news,

22:13.000 --> 22:15.130
sees that people are being
killed with hunting rifles.

22:15.160 --> 22:17.000
DAVID: And because the killers
haven't been caught,

22:17.030 --> 22:18.640
he thinks it's a good idea.

22:18.670 --> 22:20.000
TERRY: Each sniper attack is
bigger news,

22:20.040 --> 22:21.170
influencing more people.

22:21.200 --> 22:22.110
DON:
Who all own hunting rifles,

22:22.140 --> 22:24.710
and just need something
to go over the edge.

22:24.740 --> 22:26.340
EDGERTON:
Are you seriously

22:26.380 --> 22:29.910
comparing these shootings
to what, some kind of fad?

22:29.950 --> 22:31.980
One that's growing.

22:42.160 --> 22:44.260
DON: Okay, we got a
whole new approach.

22:44.290 --> 22:45.730
We're not looking
for one shooter.

22:47.330 --> 22:49.830
We're looking for seven
different perpetrators

22:49.870 --> 22:51.900
that have committed seven
different cries.

22:51.940 --> 22:54.670
They were not targets of
a serial sniper.

22:54.700 --> 22:57.810
Instead, one was the victim
of gang conflict...

23:06.880 --> 23:08.750
...another, a thrill killing...

23:13.160 --> 23:16.230
...a neighbor killed because he
didn't return a lawnmower...

23:25.040 --> 23:26.870
So we're issuing press releases

23:26.900 --> 23:29.970
explaining the separate arrests
as isolated, distinct incidents

23:30.010 --> 23:32.140
that have nothing to do
with a serial sniper.

23:32.180 --> 23:33.980
Hopefully, that'll
cool people out

23:34.010 --> 23:35.780
and get things
back to normal around here.

23:37.720 --> 23:38.880
What?

23:38.920 --> 23:40.820
Something's incomplete.

23:40.850 --> 23:43.020
Charlie, no. You just
got to be patient, all right?

23:43.050 --> 23:44.090
I mean, between us
and LAPD,

23:44.120 --> 23:46.360
we've already solved four
of th-the seven cases.

23:46.390 --> 23:47.190
Make that four

23:47.220 --> 23:48.960
out of nine.
Number eight was shot

23:48.990 --> 23:51.700
getting out of his car
at a gas station in Glendale.

23:51.730 --> 23:53.160
Nine found in his own pool.

23:53.200 --> 23:54.360
Oh, come on.

23:54.400 --> 23:55.830
It's getting away from us.

23:55.870 --> 23:58.240
It's moving faster
than we can even stop it.

23:58.270 --> 24:00.140
Your theory works.
We're breaking the cases

24:00.170 --> 24:01.670
by attacking them
individually.

24:01.710 --> 24:02.840
Let's just continue
to do that.

24:02.870 --> 24:03.710
All we've
established is

24:03.740 --> 24:05.440
that one person
could not have committed

24:05.480 --> 24:06.540
all these crimes
on the board,

24:06.580 --> 24:08.750
but that doesn't mean that
some of these shootings

24:08.780 --> 24:09.910
weren't committed
by the same hand.

24:09.950 --> 24:11.050
What? Now you're
saying you think

24:11.080 --> 24:12.850
some of them were done
by the same person?

24:12.880 --> 24:15.120
That's right, and as long
as that killer's out there,

24:15.150 --> 24:17.390
you can solve as many of
these shootings as you want,

24:17.420 --> 24:19.020
you're not gonna break
the viral behavior.

24:19.060 --> 24:19.960
'Cause we really
don't know which

24:19.990 --> 24:21.160
ones were definitively done

24:21.190 --> 24:23.030
by a serial sniper
and which ones weren't?

24:23.060 --> 24:25.760
It's got to be the first two,
because, well, because

24:25.800 --> 24:28.030
like any virus, there's
always an initial carrier.

24:28.070 --> 24:29.430
A Sniper Zero.

24:29.470 --> 24:33.700
I need to learn how
to shoot a rifle.

24:33.740 --> 24:35.710
Look, just give me a second,
would you?

24:35.740 --> 24:37.880
Okay.

24:37.910 --> 24:38.880
Y-you gotta teach me.
Why?

24:38.910 --> 24:40.850
Because of what Edgerton said?
No, you don't.

24:40.880 --> 24:42.450
You don't have to prove
yourself to anyone, okay?

24:42.480 --> 24:43.810
Please, just do
what you do.

24:43.850 --> 24:44.950
It has nothing to do
with that.

24:44.980 --> 24:46.720
I'm telling you,
Edgerton was right.

24:46.750 --> 24:47.950
Well, he was a little right.

24:47.990 --> 24:49.420
Okay, the weight of the gun,
the noise

24:49.450 --> 24:50.920
of the shot, the
effects of the recoil--

24:50.960 --> 24:52.790
there's no way I have
of understanding that

24:52.820 --> 24:54.790
because I don't know
what it is to shoot a gun.

24:54.830 --> 24:56.330
Exactly, which is why
I brought him in to begin with.

24:56.360 --> 24:58.200
Don't you see, man?

24:58.230 --> 25:00.400
I'm reducing these acts to
abstract expressions,

25:00.430 --> 25:02.970
but I don't really know
what I'm dealing with.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.740
I don't really understand
anything

25:04.770 --> 25:07.000
about guns and violence,
not the way you do.

25:08.940 --> 25:10.170
Edgerton
said it was

25:10.210 --> 25:12.340
your job to get
in the mind of a shooter.

25:12.380 --> 25:15.080
Well, maybe it's my job to
understand his mechanics.

25:16.850 --> 25:18.750
All right, look, but
you got to do me a favor

25:18.780 --> 25:19.920
and not say a word
to Dad, okay?

25:19.950 --> 25:21.820
I mean, the guy already
thinks I'm going

25:21.850 --> 25:22.890
to wind up
getting you killed.

25:24.960 --> 25:27.860
Oh. The Ruy Lopez opening.

25:27.890 --> 25:30.460
I see I'm dealing
with a classicist here.

25:30.490 --> 25:31.830
Look, I warned you

25:31.860 --> 25:33.030
I was a little rusty.

25:33.060 --> 25:35.100
My game is also a
little undeveloped.

25:35.130 --> 25:36.170
You know,
I had to stop

25:36.200 --> 25:38.340
playing with Charlie
when he was eight years old.

25:38.370 --> 25:40.000
Yeah, more
precociousness

25:40.040 --> 25:42.310
in the biography of
Professor Charles Eppes.

25:42.340 --> 25:44.040
Yeah, you know,

25:44.070 --> 25:46.380
among mathematicians,
isn't that just such

25:46.410 --> 25:47.950
a cliché,
the playing chess?

25:47.980 --> 25:49.450
I didn't mind losing.

25:49.480 --> 25:51.080
It was that bored
expression on his face,

25:51.120 --> 25:52.550
like he was playing
out of courtesy.

25:52.580 --> 25:53.550
That's what got to me.

25:53.580 --> 25:55.220
Oh, yeah? Well, try Scrabble.

25:55.250 --> 25:56.820
He's a horrible speller.

25:56.850 --> 25:58.290
Really?
Oh, he's horrible.

25:58.320 --> 25:59.960
I didn't know that.

25:59.990 --> 26:01.890
You know quite a bit
about my son.

26:01.930 --> 26:03.160
I don't know.

26:03.190 --> 26:05.060
I know he's been a delight.

26:05.100 --> 26:07.560
You know, observing
him all these years.

26:07.600 --> 26:10.130
You know, a star
pupil's ascension

26:10.170 --> 26:12.270
to such extraordinary heights...

26:12.300 --> 26:15.110
I mean, yeah, that's
perhaps the most...

26:15.140 --> 26:17.880
rewarding aspect
of being a teacher.

26:17.910 --> 26:19.510
Come on, we both know
you've been a lot more

26:19.540 --> 26:21.210
than just a teacher to Charlie.

26:22.550 --> 26:25.020
Well, thank you for saying that.

26:25.050 --> 26:27.990
By the way, uh...

26:28.020 --> 26:29.190
you're now in check.

26:29.220 --> 26:33.220
Oh, you distracted me.

26:33.260 --> 26:36.030
( chuckling )

26:36.060 --> 26:37.060
( gunshot )

26:37.090 --> 26:38.200
You're flinching.

26:38.230 --> 26:41.530
You're closing your eyes,
anticipating a loud noise.

26:41.570 --> 26:42.870
It's a loud noise.

26:42.900 --> 26:43.800
It's a perfectly natural

26:43.830 --> 26:45.470
physiological response
to what I'm doing.

26:45.500 --> 26:47.910
Charlie, that's not gonna
help you hit the target.

26:47.940 --> 26:50.240
( sighs )

26:50.270 --> 26:51.240
Look...
What?

26:51.280 --> 26:52.540
You fired the rifle.
How about

26:52.580 --> 26:53.980
we get out of here?
Come on.

26:54.010 --> 26:55.210
No. I need to learn this.

26:55.250 --> 26:56.880
Come on.

26:56.910 --> 26:57.880
All right.

26:57.920 --> 27:00.120
We'll try what's called
an empty-lung technique.

27:00.150 --> 27:01.620
You breathe naturally, you aim,

27:01.650 --> 27:02.620
but you don't fire.

27:02.650 --> 27:05.290
Okay?
So line it up, aim.

27:05.320 --> 27:08.330
You're gonna exhale, and count
to three before you inhale.

27:08.360 --> 27:10.030
On two, you
squeeze the trigger.

27:10.060 --> 27:11.300
Right? Just
like I told you.

27:11.330 --> 27:12.260
Just tease it.

27:18.270 --> 27:19.540
( shot fires )

27:23.340 --> 27:25.910
Huh.
That's pretty good.

27:25.940 --> 27:27.080
Look at that.

27:27.110 --> 27:28.080
Yeah.

27:28.110 --> 27:29.080
Ah. Adrenal response.

27:29.110 --> 27:30.010
It's a paper target.

27:30.050 --> 27:31.280
It's a little different
with a real person.

27:31.320 --> 27:34.920
Well, maybe not for Sniper Zero.

27:34.950 --> 27:36.120
That's a pretty good shot,
though, isn't it?

27:36.150 --> 27:39.290
Not bad. I think you had a
little beginner's luck there.

27:40.490 --> 27:42.130
Beginner's luck is non-empiric.

27:42.160 --> 27:43.390
It's counter-intuitive.

27:43.430 --> 27:45.360
Yeah? First time
I played golf,

27:45.400 --> 27:47.230
I parred four on
the front nine, so...

27:47.260 --> 27:48.330
That's just
a function

27:48.370 --> 27:50.030
of the "regression to the mean."

28:18.720 --> 28:22.130
According to you,
our sniper or snipers

28:22.470 --> 28:24.230
have shown no exceptional
amount of skill.

28:24.870 --> 28:26.700
There was one shooting that
showed proficiency.

28:26.740 --> 28:28.040
The homeless guy.

28:28.070 --> 28:29.970
Yeah, but he was killed
by the two frat boys.

28:30.010 --> 28:31.910
Working together gave
them a clear advantage.

28:31.940 --> 28:34.140
Yeah, so that explains
the increased skill level

28:34.180 --> 28:35.380
- in that one case.
- But yet...

28:35.410 --> 28:36.910
Yet five of the shootings

28:36.950 --> 28:38.350
have resulted
in a fatal wound

28:38.380 --> 28:39.780
from one single shot.

28:39.820 --> 28:40.580
How do you
explain that?

28:40.620 --> 28:41.760
A little ability,
a lot of luck.

28:41.950 --> 28:44.250
You know what?
You're actually exactly right.

28:44.290 --> 28:47.320
"regression to the mean."

28:47.360 --> 28:49.060
All right.

28:49.090 --> 28:52.230
I am an exceptional
basketball player,

28:52.260 --> 28:53.160
but let's say for the sake

28:53.200 --> 28:55.500
of this argument that
I'm, that I'm not.

28:55.530 --> 28:59.070
Yeah. I think I could argue that
side a little better, Charlie.

28:59.100 --> 29:00.270
Let's say I can only

29:00.300 --> 29:01.910
hit half of my shots.

29:01.940 --> 29:03.010
I am...

29:03.810 --> 29:05.040
one for three.

29:14.150 --> 29:15.220
Whoa.

29:15.250 --> 29:16.520
Okay, I'm four for six.

29:16.550 --> 29:19.060
Right? I've went
from a .333 average

29:19.090 --> 29:21.890
to a .666 average
in three shots.

29:21.930 --> 29:24.230
Now, if I just kept shooting
baskets all day long,

29:24.260 --> 29:26.800
eventually my hits and misses
will average out to about .500.

29:26.830 --> 29:28.260
Right, we have hot
and cold streaks,

29:28.300 --> 29:29.970
but over time you're
gonna find your level.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.200
That's right.

29:31.230 --> 29:33.970
Now, if I plotted my
shots on a graph,

29:34.000 --> 29:35.910
it would be a
vertical graph.

29:35.940 --> 29:38.410
I plotted the shootings
again, this time

29:38.440 --> 29:43.380
assigning scores
to each shooting,

29:43.410 --> 29:46.880
based on the difficulty of
each shot and its result.

29:46.920 --> 29:50.090
The higher up on the graph,

29:50.120 --> 29:52.320
the greater the
proficiency of the shooter.

29:56.290 --> 29:57.690
Four of the
shootings

29:57.730 --> 29:59.290
rise above the others
on the graph.

29:59.330 --> 30:00.930
Four people shot
by the same man.

30:00.960 --> 30:02.200
So we just have

30:02.230 --> 30:03.730
to find the common denominator

30:03.770 --> 30:05.100
of all four
and we find Sniper Zero.

30:05.130 --> 30:07.840
And we break the epidemic.

30:09.770 --> 30:12.610
TERRY: Maybe you go to
the same dry cleaners,

30:12.640 --> 30:14.080
use the same mechanic.

30:14.110 --> 30:17.100
No.
None of them look familiar.

30:17.200 --> 30:18.220
No?

30:19.240 --> 30:20.750
The news said

30:20.790 --> 30:22.220
this was just a random thing.

30:22.250 --> 30:23.890
That may very well be.
We're just not leaving

30:23.920 --> 30:25.690
any possibility unexplored.

30:27.590 --> 30:31.100
Steve insisted
on coming with me today.

30:32.130 --> 30:34.730
I think he's afraid
to let me out of his sight.

30:38.130 --> 30:40.100
As bad as it's been for us,

30:40.140 --> 30:44.840
what it must be like for the
families that lost someone.

30:44.870 --> 30:46.880
Yeah.

30:48.550 --> 30:49.750
Thanks for coming down.

30:54.980 --> 30:56.720
- Hey.
- SINCLAIR: Hey.

30:56.920 --> 30:58.250
All four shootings
happened

30:58.290 --> 31:00.220
in front of commercial
locations, right?

31:00.260 --> 31:01.320
Right.

31:01.360 --> 31:02.730
Real estate office,
gas station,

31:02.760 --> 31:04.430
grocery store,
movie theater,

31:04.460 --> 31:05.800
so I'm searching employee
lists, past and present.

31:05.930 --> 31:07.130
Okay. Any matches,
let me know.

31:07.160 --> 31:08.900
- You got it.
- You got anything?

31:08.980 --> 31:10.140
No, but I'm going to do
a hand search

31:10.220 --> 31:11.060
for any common points.

31:11.120 --> 31:11.900
Good.

31:16.170 --> 31:18.410
What is it, Charlie?

31:19.500 --> 31:20.680
What are we missing?

31:21.350 --> 31:23.180
Something still
isn't right.

31:23.210 --> 31:24.410
I can't figure it out.

31:29.400 --> 31:31.160
The photos.

31:31.190 --> 31:32.390
The photos?

31:32.420 --> 31:34.390
Yeah. These are
all pictures

31:34.420 --> 31:35.530
of where the
victim was hit.

31:35.560 --> 31:37.330
But that's not
the whole scene, right?

31:37.360 --> 31:40.300
The crime starts
where the bullet was shot.

31:40.330 --> 31:41.800
Where are the pictures
of the sniper's position?

31:41.830 --> 31:43.030
You're suggesting

31:43.070 --> 31:43.970
that the commonality

31:44.000 --> 31:46.140
is in the sniper's selection
of his site

31:46.170 --> 31:47.170
rather than his target?

31:47.200 --> 31:48.240
Exactly.

31:48.270 --> 31:49.410
Yeah, I considered that,

31:49.440 --> 31:51.240
but if he is a
trained sniper

31:51.280 --> 31:53.810
any site he chose would have to
take into account

31:53.840 --> 31:55.410
the availability
of targets as well.

31:55.450 --> 31:56.510
Meaning that I agree

31:56.550 --> 31:59.420
that each of these locations has
good hide selections,

31:59.450 --> 32:01.420
adequate camouflage,
excellent escape routes,

32:01.450 --> 32:03.450
but what good
would that be

32:03.490 --> 32:05.820
unless he was assured
of access to prey?

32:05.860 --> 32:07.720
The paths of the victim
and shooter would have

32:07.760 --> 32:09.390
to intersect in both time
and space

32:09.430 --> 32:10.260
within a suitable
environment.

32:10.290 --> 32:12.060
I mean, the pace
of these shootings,

32:12.100 --> 32:13.360
the scarcity of people
on the street

32:13.400 --> 32:15.200
as a result of all this
media coverage,

32:15.230 --> 32:16.270
he wouldn't have had time

32:16.300 --> 32:17.270
to accurately choose
these sites

32:17.300 --> 32:20.140
and know that he had both
cover and targets.

32:20.170 --> 32:24.070
Unless he was already
familiar with the locations.

32:24.110 --> 32:26.640
Right?

32:26.680 --> 32:29.380
An abandoned building across
from a movie theater,

32:29.410 --> 32:30.610
across from a restaurant,

32:30.650 --> 32:33.750
a gas station,
and an empty house.

32:33.780 --> 32:36.450
So we're saying he doesn't
know who he's going to shoot,

32:36.490 --> 32:38.360
but he does know where
he's going to shoot from.

32:38.390 --> 32:39.360
The victims are random.

32:39.390 --> 32:40.360
It was his position

32:40.390 --> 32:42.330
that was pre-selected.

32:42.360 --> 32:44.130
That explains why
my analyses haven't found

32:44.160 --> 32:45.500
any patterns
in victim selection

32:45.530 --> 32:46.460
or location.

32:46.500 --> 32:48.870
We just found former
employee Nathan Crane.

32:48.900 --> 32:51.400
He worked at both the gas
station and the restaurant.

32:51.440 --> 32:53.570
Well, that's two sites.
I'll take that.

33:00.180 --> 33:02.510
DAVID: Mrs. Crane, do you know
where we can find your son?

33:02.550 --> 33:06.280
No. Nathan and I haven't talked
since I asked him to leave.

33:06.320 --> 33:07.750
That was a few weeks ago.

33:07.780 --> 33:10.150
Packed his van and left.

33:10.190 --> 33:12.500
Is this him?
Yes.

33:12.760 --> 33:15.200
He was in the service
until a year ago.

33:15.440 --> 33:16.860
Nathan loved the Army.

33:16.890 --> 33:18.600
Growing up without a father,

33:18.630 --> 33:22.330
he never had that kind of
structure and discipline before.

33:22.370 --> 33:23.770
Do you know why
he left the Army?

33:23.800 --> 33:24.930
He wasn't
very specific.

33:24.970 --> 33:28.840
He just came home one day
and said it didn't work out.

33:28.870 --> 33:32.310
You said that you asked
Nathan to move out.

33:32.340 --> 33:35.510
He had a tough time
holding down a job.

33:35.550 --> 33:37.250
He'd find something

33:37.280 --> 33:39.450
and there's a problem
with the boss

33:39.480 --> 33:41.290
or a coworker and he quits.

33:43.490 --> 33:46.590
He had bad luck that way.

33:46.620 --> 33:49.590
And then there's my boyfriend.

33:49.630 --> 33:51.800
The two of them
just couldn't get along.

33:51.830 --> 33:52.700
Even at my age,

33:52.730 --> 33:56.630
I'm entitled to have a life,
aren't I?

33:57.340 --> 34:00.200
Yes, indeed.

34:21.260 --> 34:23.590
He applied for
and was rejected

34:23.630 --> 34:25.560
from the Army Sniper School
at Fort Benning.

34:25.600 --> 34:27.500
Subsequent Bad
Conduct discharge

34:27.530 --> 34:28.900
for "inability
to conform

34:28.930 --> 34:31.200
to the requirements
of military life."

34:31.240 --> 34:32.600
He's a good marksman, though.

34:32.640 --> 34:33.770
Crane did drywall
in the building across

34:33.800 --> 34:34.870
from the movie theater.

34:34.900 --> 34:36.040
He was also fired

34:36.070 --> 34:38.480
from a landscaping company
that worked the empty house.

34:38.510 --> 34:40.280
Okay, let's get an APB out
on his van, and that photo to

34:40.310 --> 34:41.610
everybody: LAPD...
Sheriff's Department...

34:41.650 --> 34:42.880
I got it.

34:42.910 --> 34:44.680
Psychological profile fits
like a glove;

34:44.710 --> 34:46.750
rejected by the Army,
a surrogate father,

34:46.780 --> 34:49.250
returns home to be rejected
by the mother.

34:49.290 --> 34:51.320
His instructor noted that he was
impulsive on the range.

34:51.360 --> 34:52.520
Also fits.
These killings are

34:52.560 --> 34:54.620
expressions of juvenile
power fantasies.

34:54.660 --> 34:57.630
Okay, but why do you think he
goes back to the job sites?

34:57.660 --> 34:58.860
He's revisiting the scenes
of his failures

34:58.900 --> 35:00.600
and converting them
to successes by killing.

35:00.630 --> 35:02.470
So you have any sense
where he would go next?

35:02.500 --> 35:04.630
Well, so far, he hasn't visited
the same site twice,

35:04.670 --> 35:05.540
either by guile

35:05.570 --> 35:07.340
or because he's "conquered"
each one.

35:07.370 --> 35:09.240
My guess is, he'll move on
to the next failed job

35:09.270 --> 35:10.070
and he'll move on quickly.

35:10.110 --> 35:11.480
From a pure sniping
point of view,

35:11.510 --> 35:13.580
I like these two.

35:13.610 --> 35:15.580
All right, let's see.

35:15.610 --> 35:19.550
He was a janitor
at the Banitek Tower...

35:19.580 --> 35:22.250
and a sheet metal punch
at the Southmore factory.

35:22.290 --> 35:24.520
Easy access, high windows,
target-rich environments.

35:24.550 --> 35:25.960
David, why don't
you take Southmore.

35:25.990 --> 35:27.490
We're gonna take
the office park.

35:27.520 --> 35:28.560
Notify LAPD.

35:28.590 --> 35:30.460
I want backup
at both locations:

35:30.490 --> 35:32.500
marked cars,
SWAT, air units...

35:32.530 --> 35:34.430
Helicopters?
You trying to scare him away?

35:34.460 --> 35:35.400
No, we're just going
to make sure

35:35.430 --> 35:36.930
he doesn't shoot anyone
else, that's for sure.

35:55.550 --> 35:56.850
Don!

36:03.860 --> 36:05.400
Looks like it, huh?

36:05.430 --> 36:06.300
Yep.

36:06.330 --> 36:08.630
All right, you take
the middle doors.

36:08.670 --> 36:10.870
Got it.

36:29.990 --> 36:30.950
That's it.

36:30.990 --> 36:32.690
Foxtrot One.

36:32.720 --> 36:33.660
Foxtrot One, go ahead.

36:33.690 --> 36:35.790
We got a postive I.D.
on suspect's vehicle

36:35.830 --> 36:36.630
at Banitek Towers.

36:36.660 --> 36:39.330
Direct all units
to Banitek Towers.

36:39.360 --> 36:40.800
Roger that.

36:40.830 --> 36:43.670
You know, we should start
clearing people out of here.

36:43.700 --> 36:45.640
Let's just get
everybody out.

36:45.670 --> 36:46.800
FBI Unit Foxtrot Two.

36:46.840 --> 36:48.710
Foxtrot Two,
I copy your location.

36:48.740 --> 36:50.910
Banitek Towers.
We have an air unit en route,

36:50.940 --> 36:52.110
ETA two minutes, over.

36:52.140 --> 36:53.440
We need to notify Security
in the building

36:53.480 --> 36:54.740
to keep everyone inside.

36:54.780 --> 36:56.450
- Roger that.
- Excuse me!

36:56.480 --> 36:58.980
We need you to get
inside the building, please.

37:08.660 --> 37:09.990
Agent Eppes,
Lieutenant Douglas.

37:10.030 --> 37:11.060
Your teams are where?

37:11.090 --> 37:11.900
Blue Team and Red Team

37:11.930 --> 37:12.760
are about eight
minutes out, sir.

37:12.800 --> 37:14.600
All right, as soon
at they get here,

37:14.630 --> 37:16.030
I want a team on each
of these roofs, right?

37:16.070 --> 37:17.130
Right there,
right there.

37:17.170 --> 37:18.570
Roger that.
I'll make it happen.

37:18.600 --> 37:19.900
Pass these out.
We're looking

37:19.940 --> 37:21.740
for a male white
in his 20s, okay?

37:21.770 --> 37:22.970
I want you two
to take this building.

37:23.010 --> 37:24.940
Start on the top floor and work
your way down every apartment.

37:24.970 --> 37:26.640
You two, the same thing,
this building.

37:26.680 --> 37:27.710
You start on the bottom

37:27.740 --> 37:28.910
of this one,
work your way up.

37:28.950 --> 37:31.780
You on this one,
work your way up.

37:31.820 --> 37:34.020
( helicopter approaching )

38:15.530 --> 38:17.760
David Sinclair,
yeah.

38:32.010 --> 38:33.510
( shot fires )
Charlie, get down!

38:33.540 --> 38:34.740
What?

38:34.780 --> 38:35.710
Charlie, get down!

38:37.550 --> 38:40.550
Charlie, stay down!
( gunshot )

38:45.860 --> 38:46.720
( gunshot )

38:51.800 --> 38:53.130
MAN:
Get a team up there, now!

38:53.160 --> 38:56.470
Shooter is down.
Repeat! Shooter is down!

38:56.500 --> 38:57.800
You all right?
Yeah.

38:57.830 --> 38:58.970
The shooter's down.

38:59.000 --> 39:00.170
Is he okay?

39:00.200 --> 39:01.000
What, are you crazy?

39:01.040 --> 39:01.910
You could have got
yourself killed.

39:01.940 --> 39:04.770
I was just... working on
some probabilities

39:04.810 --> 39:05.640
as to where

39:05.680 --> 39:07.680
I thought Crane
might position himself.

39:07.710 --> 39:08.780
Actually,
he was pretty close.

39:08.810 --> 39:11.550
I want to get you
out of here.

39:11.580 --> 39:12.680
Are you all right?

39:12.720 --> 39:13.750
I'm sorry.

39:13.780 --> 39:15.920
It's all right. It's just next
time, use a phone.

39:15.950 --> 39:17.690
Okay?

39:25.830 --> 39:28.970
Hey, Dad,
you're painting, huh?

39:29.000 --> 39:29.930
Staining.

39:29.970 --> 39:33.000
Your brother, the homeowner,
it's his idea.

39:33.040 --> 39:35.840
Hey, look, I was thinking
about what you said

39:35.870 --> 39:37.810
the other day when you came by
for lunch.

39:37.840 --> 39:39.140
I think you're right.

39:39.180 --> 39:41.680
Wow.

39:41.710 --> 39:43.780
As delighted as I am
to hear those words

39:43.810 --> 39:45.920
come out of the mouths
of either of my sons

39:45.950 --> 39:47.980
the fact is I wasn't.

39:48.020 --> 39:50.690
Your brother's
his own man.

39:50.720 --> 39:52.560
I mean, if Charlie wants
to run off

39:52.590 --> 39:54.160
and do slightly
dangerous things,

39:54.190 --> 39:56.860
then I'll just have to
learn to live with it.

39:56.890 --> 39:58.060
Same as I did
with you.

39:59.900 --> 40:01.600
You told him?

40:01.630 --> 40:03.870
Yeah, about the gun range.

40:03.900 --> 40:05.200
- The gun range.
- That you shot a rifle.

40:05.230 --> 40:06.840
job.hot a rifle, did a great

40:06.870 --> 40:07.900
Fired the rifle.

40:07.940 --> 40:08.970
Yeah. See?
I'm perfectly fine.

40:09.010 --> 40:11.880
I didn't fall off the ladder,
I didn't collapse.

40:11.910 --> 40:14.080
I certainly hope you got that
out of your system now.

40:14.110 --> 40:16.780
Definitely.

40:16.810 --> 40:18.010
What color paint are you using?

40:18.050 --> 40:19.680
No, no, it's not paint.
Stain.

40:19.720 --> 40:21.180
You can't paint
a Craftsman house.

40:21.220 --> 40:22.850
See, they're
historically protected.

40:22.890 --> 40:24.920
Well, even if everyone
else paints

40:24.950 --> 40:26.260
their houses blue, Charlie?

40:27.000 --> 40:27.890
Not even.

40:30.300 --> 40:32.360
Here, I'll help you.
