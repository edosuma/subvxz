This contains all that survived.
It is already regenerating.

20:16.457 --> 20:18.357
The creature requires further research...

20:18.526 --> 20:21.586
...but with the dome compromised
and the science center in ruins...

20:21.762 --> 20:25.459
...we cannot safely secure or study
it here in Atlantis.

20:25.633 --> 20:28.033
Perhaps the surface world can do better.

20:28.202 --> 20:31.035
I'm sure they will be eager to try.

20:31.205 --> 20:33.139
Kaldur?

20:34.308 --> 20:37.209
Call me Aqualad, my king.

20:42.216 --> 20:45.413
Kaldur, l... We...

20:45.586 --> 20:49.317
- That is...
- I wish you both nothing but the best.

20:54.328 --> 20:57.729
Have you ever wondered what would
have happened if I had stayed behind...

20:57.898 --> 20:59.661
...and you had become Aqualad?

21:00.368 --> 21:01.460
Never.

21:02.203 --> 21:05.468
No, neither have I.

21:06.741 --> 21:11.906
<i>COMPUTER VOICE:
Recognized, Aqualad B-02.</i>

21:13.547 --> 21:14.571
Made your decision?

21:14.749 --> 21:19.243
The decision is made.
I am here, 100 percent.

21:19.887 --> 21:21.514
Just in time for your next mission.

21:23.257 --> 21:28.718
The Watchtower detected an immense
power surge in the Bialyan desert.

21:33.100 --> 21:35.193
BLACK MANTA:
I was unable to secure the objective...

21:35.369 --> 21:37.837
...and was forced to execute Plan B.

21:38.005 --> 21:42.840
<i>OCEAN MASTER:
You did well. Everything falls into place.</i>
