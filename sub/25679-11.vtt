{\an7}Really?

{\an8}You know what I'm saying?

00:09.642 --> 00:11.745
{\an8}But, you know, I was in foster

00:11.811 --> 00:13.680
{\an8}I want a better relationship,

00:13.747 --> 00:15.982
{\an7}but I'm just a little scarred
from when I was a kid.

00:16.049 --> 00:18.852
{\an8}Okay. I would pay for us
to go see a psychiatrist.

00:18.918 --> 00:21.254
{\an8}Hopefully we can work
through all of this.

00:21.321 --> 00:22.489

I'm really sorry.
I did not... I had no idea

that they were gonna
take it there with you.

02:08.061 --> 02:10.964
{\an8}La'Britney and Brooke were
totally unprofessional,

02:11.030 --> 02:14.400
{\an8}interrupting my interview with
the TEAm Curtains UK bloggers.

02:14.467 --> 02:15.468
{\an1}(Teairra)
Leave me alone!

02:15.535 --> 02:16.903
All right.
Well, I tried.

02:16.970 --> 02:19.973
What made it worse was
those UK bloggers had the nerve

02:20.039 --> 02:22.208
to ask Teairra where they could
see her videos.

02:22.275 --> 02:23.443
Inappropriate.

02:23.510 --> 02:26.446
What the (bleep) was that?

02:26.513 --> 02:27.747
Why you asking me?

02:27.814 --> 02:29.816
Because you came outside
with a (bleep) banana.

02:29.883 --> 02:30.884
It's like,
like a (bleep) circus.

02:30.950 --> 02:32.051
{\an8}My banana had nothing to do

02:32.118 --> 02:33.152
{\an7}with what that dude
was gonna ask Teairra.

02:33.219 --> 02:34.654
{\an8}At the end of the day,

02:34.721 --> 02:36.856
{\an1}that was my whole album
promo (bleep) that was set up

02:36.923 --> 02:38.525
specifically
for my album promo.

02:38.591 --> 02:42.395
{\an5}This is true.

02:38.591 --> 02:42.395
{\an1}And y'all came down and
took over the whole (bleep).

02:42.462 --> 02:45.365
And then put me on the spot to
have La'Britney open tomorrow.

02:45.431 --> 02:46.900
You could have had that
conversation at any point.

02:46.966 --> 02:48.935
{\an4}I just thought of it,
Bridget, calm down.

02:46.966 --> 02:48.935
At any point.

02:49.002 --> 02:50.470
And then Teairra comes out

02:50.537 --> 02:51.538
and then
the (bleep) interviewer

02:51.604 --> 02:53.273
mentions her (bleep)
sex tape.

02:53.339 --> 02:54.674
{\an8}What?

02:53.339 --> 02:54.674
{\an7}Why?

02:53.339 --> 02:54.674
{\an5}So then she's a...

02:54.741 --> 02:56.175
{\an8}Because he's a clown.

02:56.242 --> 02:58.111
{\an8}Here they can ask whatever
the (bleep) they wanna ask.

02:58.177 --> 02:59.946
{\an5}They ask you in your face.

02:58.177 --> 02:59.946
{\an1}(Nikki)
Well, first of all,

03:00.013 --> 03:01.714
{\an1}a banana ain't got (bleep)
to do with a sex tape.

03:01.781 --> 03:03.249
{\an1}That (bleep),
that's a (bleep)--

03:03.316 --> 03:05.351
{\an5}Yes, Nikki.

03:03.316 --> 03:05.351
But, like,
maybe you should ask him--

03:10.823 --> 03:12.725
Look, I'm here
to talk about my album!

03:12.792 --> 03:13.927
I came here for one purpose

03:13.993 --> 03:15.528
and I wanted y'all
out here with me,

03:15.595 --> 03:17.430
{\an1}full out,
so that we could be a group,

03:17.497 --> 03:18.498
and I needed y'all support
right now

03:18.565 --> 03:19.732
and I didn't (bleep) have it.

03:19.799 --> 03:22.835
I'm so mad, Brooke,
I'm so mad.

03:22.902 --> 03:25.538
You my friend, you're
supposed to hold me down,

03:25.605 --> 03:28.274
{\an1}and you came out there and
you made me look stupid, fam.

03:28.341 --> 03:30.209
{\an3}I'm sorry!

03:30.276 --> 03:32.045
I don't really feel bad

03:32.111 --> 03:34.781
for crashing
Bridget Kelly's situation.

03:34.847 --> 03:36.316
It was boring anyway.

03:36.382 --> 03:38.484
She was probably out there
talking about some aunty music

03:38.551 --> 03:40.153
and some old sad song
or something.

to make Bridget cry,

{\an8}but those bloggers were
completely unprofessional.

{\an1}I don't know
if I can be able to do 'em,

07:17.170 --> 07:20.006
{\an4}'cause I don't wanna
not spend time with my baby.

07:17.170 --> 07:20.006

07:20.072 --> 07:21.340
How do, how do you do it?

07:21.407 --> 07:23.209
Listen, my son changed me.

07:23.276 --> 07:24.777
You just gotta be bouncing
back and forth

07:24.844 --> 07:25.945
and just doing your thing.

07:26.012 --> 07:27.647
{\an8}My son Syhre,
he's two years old,

07:27.713 --> 07:30.416
and that's my favorite person
in the world.

07:30.483 --> 07:32.084

07:30.483 --> 07:32.084
{\an1}Hi!

07:32.151 --> 07:33.986
{\an6}Hi, Daddy.

07:32.151 --> 07:33.986
Mmm... buddy.

07:34.053 --> 07:35.788
It's definitely been a task

07:35.855 --> 07:38.324
juggling being a dad
and working on music,

07:38.391 --> 07:40.293
but me and Syhre's mom,
we work together

07:40.359 --> 07:42.962
to make sure everything
keeps in perfect balance.

07:43.029 --> 07:44.831
I'm having another issue
with the music.

07:44.897 --> 07:46.365
It ain't time right now.

07:46.432 --> 07:48.367
It's the fact
that I keep dealing

07:48.434 --> 07:50.436

of all time.

07:50.503 --> 07:52.205
I'm talking about Moniece.

07:52.271 --> 07:54.640
You working with Moniece?

07:54.707 --> 07:56.742
Man, let me tell you.

07:56.809 --> 07:57.877
She singing
like Barry White.

"Look, Moniece,
go in the booth,

07:59.512 --> 08:00.746

08:00.813 --> 08:02.481
I think she got
a little bit intimidated.

08:02.548 --> 08:04.383
She just walked outside...

08:04.450 --> 08:06.719
and just....
fell out on the floor.

08:06.786 --> 08:07.920
{\an3}Hold on...

"Right?

08:11.924 --> 08:13.059
So... she's like...

08:13.125 --> 08:15.962
"My heart has been doing
this thing all day."

08:16.028 --> 08:17.830

done showed up.

08:17.897 --> 08:19.899

Oscar-nominated joint.

08:19.966 --> 08:22.168

At minimum.

all the way out here

08:26.439 --> 08:27.974

13:59.238 --> 14:01.840
you reached out to him
but now you feel like...

14:01.907 --> 14:04.777
{\an4}I stepped back
soon as I did that.

14:01.907 --> 14:04.777
You stepped back, yeah.

14:04.843 --> 14:06.478
{\an1}I guess I just wanted
to find him, but...

14:06.545 --> 14:08.414
{\an1}I just want answers
and the truth.

14:08.480 --> 14:11.016
{\an1}Well, I appreciate everything
that you've been sharing

14:11.083 --> 14:12.418
and I'm gonna go get your dad

14:12.484 --> 14:14.987
so we can try to see
what we can do together.

14:15.054 --> 14:16.088
{\an1}(sighing)
All right.

14:16.155 --> 14:17.122
All right.
Take a deep breath.

14:17.189 --> 14:18.857
(both laugh)

14:18.924 --> 14:21.126
{\an5}(Apple)
I'm a stubborn woman
for a good reason.

14:21.193 --> 14:22.861
I was brought up in foster care,

14:22.928 --> 14:25.331
so it's hard for me
to trust anybody.

14:25.397 --> 14:26.865
And guess
who's number one on the list?

14:26.932 --> 14:28.300
My father.

14:28.367 --> 14:29.902
My dad been trying to build
a relationship with me

14:29.969 --> 14:31.870
since I found him six years ago,

14:31.937 --> 14:34.440
but I still can't get over
one question.

14:34.506 --> 14:36.508
Why did you leave? Why?

14:38.043 --> 14:40.479
Come right this way.

14:40.546 --> 14:42.748
I appreciate you coming in.

14:42.815 --> 14:44.350
Oh, thank you.

14:44.416 --> 14:48.387
And you can sit
right there for me.

14:48.454 --> 14:50.055
It's our first time
meeting today,

14:50.122 --> 14:51.190
and I'm glad that you were

14:51.257 --> 14:53.092
willing to come in,

14:53.158 --> 14:56.996
{\an1}because a lot of times,
people are against counseling.

14:57.062 --> 14:59.431
{\an5}(Apple)
It's different
with my new manager, Shun.

14:59.498 --> 15:01.533
Don't get me wrong, I have
my doubts about her,

15:01.600 --> 15:03.502
but that's
a business relationship.

15:03.569 --> 15:06.205
My dad?
This is a whole other barrier

15:06.272 --> 15:08.007
that I've been trying
to break through.

15:08.073 --> 15:11.510
So if a therapist can help,
I promised my dad I would try.

15:11.577 --> 15:14.813
So, if you can tell me,
from your perspective,

15:14.880 --> 15:17.082
about your relationship
with Apple.

15:17.149 --> 15:18.150
{\an8}It's a little rocky.

15:18.217 --> 15:19.385
{\an7}Yeah.

15:19.451 --> 15:20.552
Were you with her mom?

15:20.619 --> 15:22.254
I was with her mom
at the beginning

15:22.321 --> 15:23.722
and then her ma
became pregnant,

15:23.789 --> 15:25.924
and after she had Apple,

15:25.991 --> 15:27.493
{\an5}we broke up.

15:25.991 --> 15:27.493
{\an1}Okay.

15:27.559 --> 15:32.364
{\an1}Six years ago,
Apple went on, um...

15:32.431 --> 15:33.699
{\an6}Facebook--

15:32.431 --> 15:33.699
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.000
--to find me,

15:35.067 --> 15:36.135
{\an6}and we met.

15:35.067 --> 15:36.135
Okay.

15:36.201 --> 15:38.237
And I've tried to be
a part of her life.

15:38.304 --> 15:41.006
I've been texting her
almost every day.

15:41.073 --> 15:43.842
{\an4}You know,
"Good morning," "Good night,"
to make sure she's okay.

15:43.909 --> 15:45.711
She rarely called back.

15:45.778 --> 15:47.079
Right.

15:47.146 --> 15:49.281
You kind of create a barrier,

15:49.348 --> 15:51.050
so trying to figure out,

15:51.116 --> 15:54.687
{\an1}uh, what you would like
the relationship to look like.

15:54.753 --> 15:56.488
I don't know.

15:56.555 --> 15:57.690
I can't say that right now.

15:57.756 --> 15:59.024
{\an4}Like...

15:57.756 --> 15:59.024
{\an3}Yeah.

15:59.091 --> 16:01.593
{\an1}...situations between me
and my dad, how I'm feeling,

16:01.660 --> 16:04.563
{\an4}it brings back old memories
when I trying to fix my future
right now.

16:04.630 --> 16:06.432
{\an5}But every time I see him--

16:04.630 --> 16:06.432
{\an3}Mm-hmm.

16:06.498 --> 16:08.400
--it makes it come right back.

16:08.467 --> 16:10.803
It's just awkward, sometimes,

16:10.869 --> 16:12.237
being alone with you.

16:12.304 --> 16:14.740
Not saying, like, we're alone,
you know, all the time,

16:14.807 --> 16:16.475
but I'm saying,
like, it's just awkward.

16:16.542 --> 16:19.178
{\an5}I don't know how to explain
the feeling.

16:16.542 --> 16:19.178

She all right, though.

21:18.076 --> 21:20.379
{\an5}Look at his face!

21:18.076 --> 21:20.379
{\an1}Aah...

21:20.445 --> 21:23.982
She a cool girl, man.
We have fun, you know?

21:24.049 --> 21:25.150
{\an3}That's big.

21:25.217 --> 21:26.818
Roccstar!
There he is!

21:26.885 --> 21:28.820
{\an4}Another father.
Just came?

21:26.885 --> 21:28.820
{\an3}(laughing)

21:28.887 --> 21:31.056
{\an1}You know what I'm saying?
This is Father Figure Fridays.

21:31.123 --> 21:32.357
This the new squad.

21:32.424 --> 21:34.726
I told y'all
I'm not (bleep) with A1.

21:34.793 --> 21:35.794
You know what I'm saying?

21:35.861 --> 21:37.663
Roccstar is in the camp now.

21:37.729 --> 21:40.032
{\an1}Ray, you through

21:40.098 --> 21:42.000
{\an8}Nah, listen, listen.

21:40.098 --> 21:42.000
{\an8}Hey, man, A1 got into it.

21:42.067 --> 21:44.336

I can't like the (bleep).

21:44.403 --> 21:46.938
This the one that was
at Donatella's showcase

21:47.005 --> 21:49.307
high-fiving Lyrica and
(bleep) like they was besties.

21:49.374 --> 21:50.709
Man, that's some real talk.

One of my best friends.

21:56.715 --> 21:57.949
{\an1}(Lyrica)
We best friends!

21:58.016 --> 22:01.353
Then let the record show
I stayed on my guy A1.

22:01.420 --> 22:03.488
Aw, you was there

22:06.124 --> 22:08.694
{\an5}(Ray)
Everybody fathers, fam,
you know what I'm saying?

22:08.760 --> 22:11.563
This is Roccstar,

22:11.630 --> 22:13.298
{\an1}that we all

22:13.365 --> 22:14.466

Yeah, yeah.

22:17.436 --> 22:18.437
{\an3}(Ray)

22:22.607 --> 22:24.309
{\an5}We gotta work.

22:22.607 --> 22:24.309
We gotta.
You feel me?

22:24.376 --> 22:25.877
We gotta work,
we gotta work.

22:25.944 --> 22:28.480
I wanna do (bleep) and bless
everybody with fatherly love.

22:28.547 --> 22:31.049
Man, you know, racing cars
was fun an everything,

22:31.116 --> 22:33.485
but I ain't really
trying to be here right now.

22:33.552 --> 22:36.154
Ray J trying to replace A1
with Roccstar,

22:36.221 --> 22:38.123
that's just something
I'm not rocking with.

22:38.190 --> 22:42.294
Yo, Lyrica was telling me
A1 had a gastric bypass

22:42.360 --> 22:46.164
{\an1}but I don't wanna reveal
what's going on with Lyrica.

22:48.433 --> 22:49.735
I'm not about to deal
with y'all like that.

22:49.801 --> 22:51.837
{\an4}No, I'm...

22:49.801 --> 22:51.837
(laughing)
Hey... hey...

22:51.903 --> 22:53.205
{\an5}We're not about this.

22:51.903 --> 22:53.205
{\an1}Listen.

22:53.271 --> 22:56.641
You got something that you
need to bring to the table.

22:56.708 --> 22:57.909
I'm just saying.

22:57.976 --> 23:00.312
{\an1}Safaree did whatever he did,
took on Safaree.

23:00.378 --> 23:01.680
(bleep) just
racing through and,

23:01.747 --> 23:05.016
and then I jumped
in the mother(bleep) car.

23:05.083 --> 23:07.319
{\an5}Ooh.

23:05.083 --> 23:07.319
Are you saying you rode Lyrica?

23:09.221 --> 23:11.723
{\an5}(Ray laughing)

23:09.221 --> 23:11.723
{\an1}(Solo)
This is too much!

23:15.160 --> 23:16.728
{\an5}Damn all the analogies.

23:15.160 --> 23:16.728
{\an3}All right.

23:16.795 --> 23:19.131
{\an1}Are you saying
you was (bleep) Lyrica?

23:19.197 --> 23:23.969
You, you see
that I jumped in the car.

23:24.035 --> 23:25.604
It was a bumpy ride.

23:25.670 --> 23:28.006
It was like driving
through the Sahara Desert.

23:28.073 --> 23:29.074
(laughs)

23:34.746 --> 23:36.414
{\an7}I'm out.

23:36.481 --> 23:38.350
{\an5}I'm 'bout to go race a car.

23:36.481 --> 23:38.350
{\an1}(Roccstar)
But what I'm saying is...

23:38.416 --> 23:39.751
{\an4}Nope.

23:38.416 --> 23:39.751
(Ray laughing)

23:39.818 --> 23:40.886
Hey, Ray, I'm racing a car.

23:40.952 --> 23:42.187
At poker night,

23:42.254 --> 23:44.189
when Ray J. brought up
Safaree smashing Lyrica,

23:44.256 --> 23:46.591
A1 was there
to nip that in the bud.

23:46.658 --> 23:48.160
But your man Roccstar
sitting up here

23:48.226 --> 23:50.729
bragging about smashing
another man's wife?

23:50.796 --> 23:52.464
That breaks the bro code,

23:52.531 --> 23:54.065
and that's
no brother of mine.

I heard it's good, though.

27:14.766 --> 27:17.235
But since there are people
living in glass houses,

27:17.302 --> 27:19.304
trying to throw rocks
at the table,

27:19.371 --> 27:22.040
I might have to throw
a stone of my own.

Next question.

27:36.588 --> 27:37.689
Well, that's not what I heard.

27:39.691 --> 27:40.992
We've all heard things
about Nikki.

There's somebody running around
saying something,

27:56.041 --> 27:57.575
{\an5}let's just put it on the table.

27:56.041 --> 27:57.575
{\an1}Right.

27:57.642 --> 27:59.844
{\an1}And what I'm saying is
if I wanna (bleep) a (bleep)

27:59.911 --> 28:01.112
{\an1}or do anything I want,
I can do it.

28:01.179 --> 28:02.280

28:02.347 --> 28:05.250
Now cut that
fake (bleep) out, bro.

I ever did to Brooke

with this Lucci rumor.

28:09.621 --> 28:11.756
Brooke and whoever else
is spreading this lie,

28:11.823 --> 28:13.224
they gonna get theirs.

your glass is just shaking.

28:15.927 --> 28:17.996
{\an1}Mm-hmm.
I just get a little frustrated

28:18.063 --> 28:20.331
{\an1}'cause I feel like we have
these moments,

28:20.398 --> 28:22.000
{\an1}and then we get
into these settings

28:22.067 --> 28:25.136
and we just start going
for the (bleep) jugular,

28:25.203 --> 28:27.238
and then it gets
hard to believe

28:27.305 --> 28:30.508
what friendships are real and
sincere and which ones aren't.

28:30.575 --> 28:32.177
Me and Nikki have had
our fair share of problems,

28:32.243 --> 28:34.712
but just like Brooke
was being shady with me

28:34.779 --> 28:36.881
in the studio during
my session with Roccstar,

28:36.948 --> 28:39.818
Brooke is being messy,
and that's really not cool.

28:39.884 --> 28:42.320
At what point do we just lay
the (bleep) out on the table

28:42.387 --> 28:45.290
{\an1}and everybody just
keeps it a (bleep) buck.

28:45.356 --> 28:48.359
{\an1}Or I just don't (bleep) with you
and we can agree to disagree.

28:48.426 --> 28:49.527
We can move the (bleep) on.

28:49.594 --> 28:51.196
{\an1}Either there's
a conflict and a resolution

28:51.262 --> 28:52.464
{\an1}or there's solutions
and avoidances.

28:52.530 --> 28:54.065
