WEBVTT

00:16.816 --> 00:22.622
(upbeat pop music)

00:50.050 --> 00:53.853
(music intensifies)

01:11.237 --> 01:12.972
(Shoresy): Alright,
shut the fuck up!

01:12.972 --> 01:15.275
Sanger's got the floor.

01:15.275 --> 01:17.510
Let's listen up here, boys.
Everybody listen up here now.

01:17.510 --> 01:19.379
Alright, gents,
thanks for stickin' around

01:19.379 --> 01:21.081
for this little players only.

01:21.081 --> 01:23.583
Even though it isn't really
a players only 'cause I'm here.

01:23.583 --> 01:25.652
Yeah, but like he's one
of the boys, so it'd be

01:25.652 --> 01:27.353
weird if he wasn't here
for the players only.

01:27.353 --> 01:28.721
(loud fart)
- Who's runnin' it?

01:28.721 --> 01:30.156
(Shoresy): Shut the fuck up, Michaels.

01:30.156 --> 01:32.092
- I thought I'd run it.
- Yeah, like he's the coach,

01:32.092 --> 01:34.027
he's usually the one talkin'
so it'd be weird if he was

01:34.027 --> 01:35.662
just here listenin'
to someone talk. It's like...

01:35.662 --> 01:37.931
it's like, he's usually
the one talkin'.

01:37.931 --> 01:39.365
Can I phone a call?

01:39.365 --> 01:41.534
- Can you phone a call?
- Can I?

01:41.534 --> 01:43.203
What, are you gonna
order a fuckin' pizza?

01:43.203 --> 01:45.772
Uh, I'll just get right
into it. You're fuckin' up.

01:45.772 --> 01:47.807
You're fuckin' up.
You're fuckin' up.

01:47.807 --> 01:50.443
And until very recently,
you were fucking up.

01:50.443 --> 01:52.278
- How am I fucking up?
- Let's start with someone

01:52.278 --> 01:53.513
more important.
(Sanguinet): The Jims?

01:53.513 --> 01:54.714
Yeah. And in the meantime,

01:54.714 --> 01:57.150
Goody, Dolo,
tie your dick to your leg.

01:57.917 --> 01:59.385
- Jim.
- Yeah?

01:59.385 --> 02:00.653
- Jim.
- Hello.

02:00.653 --> 02:01.988
- Jim.
- Let's hear it, Sanger.

02:01.988 --> 02:03.857
Let us have it, buddy.
- You're late for games

02:03.857 --> 02:06.159
and when you show up,
you're not focused.

02:06.159 --> 02:07.994
And even after the games,
you scramble to the showers

02:07.994 --> 02:10.330
and out the door.
- Which is usually what guys do

02:10.330 --> 02:11.764
if they don't want us
to see their dinks,

02:11.764 --> 02:13.800
but like, we've see your dinks.
- Yeah.

02:13.800 --> 02:15.602
- We've seen 'em a ton of times.
- Settle down.

02:15.602 --> 02:17.570
We just likes it when ya
hangs out with the b'ys

02:17.570 --> 02:18.872
for a bit after, that's all.

02:18.872 --> 02:21.274
(speaking French)

02:21.274 --> 02:22.709
Jims are unbelievable.

02:24.544 --> 02:25.645
Jims?

02:27.614 --> 02:29.816
We're doin' real bad
at Reach For The Top.

02:30.550 --> 02:31.784
- Trivia?
- Yeah.

02:31.784 --> 02:33.620
- Huh?
- Usually there's four people

02:33.620 --> 02:35.355
on a team, but we're down a man.

02:35.355 --> 02:36.956
And he was the guy
who always got us goin'.

02:36.956 --> 02:38.691
Ah, see boys,
you gotta set the tone.

02:38.691 --> 02:39.993
Can't get into
the game without him.

02:39.993 --> 02:41.895
Someone's gotta set
the tone out there, boys!

02:41.895 --> 02:43.897
Someone's gotta fuckin' set it!
- You see, th-th-that is a very

02:43.897 --> 02:45.899
interesting parallel,
because the Jims need someone

02:45.899 --> 02:47.600
to set the tone in order
to get it going,

02:47.600 --> 02:49.302
and we need the Jims
to set the tone.

02:49.302 --> 02:50.570
Shut up, Michaels,
you fuckin' nerd.

02:50.570 --> 02:52.105
What happened
to your other guy?

02:52.105 --> 02:53.573
- He got stabbed.
- By who?

02:53.573 --> 02:55.508
- By a big Indian.
- We're just feeling banged up

02:55.508 --> 02:57.010
from getting pumped
at Reach For The Top.

02:57.010 --> 02:59.445
And now we're comin' here
and gettin' pumped too.

02:59.445 --> 03:02.515
So what you're sayin'
is you just needs
one of the b'ys

03:02.515 --> 03:04.150
to come where you're to?
- Yeah.

03:04.150 --> 03:06.586
Come on, b'ys, let's send
someone where der at.

03:06.586 --> 03:08.655
Does it have to be another
jail guard on your team,

03:08.655 --> 03:10.423
or can it be one of us?

03:10.423 --> 03:11.691
The other jail guards
don't wanna play

03:11.691 --> 03:13.126
Reach For The Top anymore.

03:13.126 --> 03:14.694
Because one got stabbed.

03:14.694 --> 03:15.929
By a big Indian.

03:15.929 --> 03:17.130
Alright, gents,

03:17.130 --> 03:19.532
looks like we're looking
for a fourth man for the Jims.

03:20.633 --> 03:22.335
We got any beers?

03:22.335 --> 03:23.770
They're warm.
(Shoresy): Huh?

03:23.770 --> 03:26.573
Boys dumped all
the cold ones on me so--

03:27.941 --> 03:29.509
I just think this
players only is goin'

03:29.509 --> 03:30.810
a bit long to not be
havin' beers.

03:30.810 --> 03:32.579
- Couple frosty ones.
- Should we get

03:32.579 --> 03:33.913
some beers
for the players only?

03:33.913 --> 03:35.315
Well, we could take
the players only

03:35.315 --> 03:38.051
to where there's beers.
- That's a good idea, ol' man.

03:39.586 --> 03:40.853
Couple chilly ones?

03:40.853 --> 03:41.854
(rock music)

03:41.854 --> 03:43.022
(Shoresy): Pretty good pizza
here, boys.

03:43.022 --> 03:45.525
Let's get hammerin'
some pizza here now.

03:45.525 --> 03:48.294
Alright, boys,
Reach For The Top. Who's smart?

03:48.294 --> 03:50.863
(indistinct background chatter)

03:52.131 --> 03:53.833
Maybe we start
at the other end of 'er

03:53.833 --> 03:56.169
and weed some guys out.

03:56.169 --> 03:58.304
Okay, who's dumb?

04:00.306 --> 04:02.875
Now we're movin' here, boys,
let's keep 'er movin' here now.

04:02.875 --> 04:05.144
- Hitch and Michaels.
- How are we gonna figure out

04:05.144 --> 04:06.613
who's less dumb?

04:06.613 --> 04:07.880
We'll throw some
trivia at you

04:07.880 --> 04:09.048
and whoever gets
the most right wins.

04:09.048 --> 04:11.050
B'y, this could
take all night.

04:11.551 --> 04:13.019
Even as the smartest
b'ys here,

04:13.019 --> 04:14.787
I still think we'll
get most of 'em wrong.

04:14.787 --> 04:16.489
- Yeah.
- Ya think?

04:16.489 --> 04:18.024
- Yes.
- Why?

04:18.024 --> 04:19.192
Look at 'em.

04:19.192 --> 04:20.426
Well, maybe I get in there

04:20.426 --> 04:22.028
and speed things up
a little bit.

04:23.663 --> 04:25.265
Well, I'm the dumbest
guy here so--

04:25.265 --> 04:26.599
Fish is pretty dumb.

04:26.599 --> 04:27.900
No, Fish only looks dumb.

04:27.900 --> 04:29.902
He's not actually that dumb.
- Thanks, Shoresy.

04:29.902 --> 04:32.171
- Got a dip?
- He's not as dumb as Shoresy.

04:32.171 --> 04:33.706
I'm the dumbest guy here.

04:33.706 --> 04:36.843
So, if I get one right
that someone else doesn't get,

04:36.843 --> 04:39.045
he should automatically be out.

04:41.881 --> 04:43.750
- Thanks, big boy.
- Shoresy, can I phone--

04:43.750 --> 04:46.619
Oh, my God, Frankie,
you can order DQ from an app!

04:46.619 --> 04:47.920
You don't have to call.

04:50.757 --> 04:52.025
You, you, and you,

04:52.025 --> 04:53.826
you're all candidates
for the fourth man

04:53.826 --> 04:55.028
for the Jims' trivia team.

04:55.028 --> 04:56.796
What would you do if selected?
Hitch?

04:56.796 --> 04:58.798
- Study all night.
- Michaels?

04:58.798 --> 05:00.400
Well, I'd have
a positive attitude.

05:00.400 --> 05:01.734
- Shoresy?
- Fuck yer mom.

05:01.734 --> 05:03.469
Tell us about
your strategy, Hitch.

05:03.469 --> 05:04.837
B'y, I'll be
the first to admit

05:04.837 --> 05:06.639
that as a "Newfie",
we gets a bad rap

05:06.639 --> 05:08.808
for bein' dumb.
What with the volume we drinks

05:08.808 --> 05:10.376
and the way we talks.

05:10.376 --> 05:13.313
But what we lacks in grey matter
we makes up for in work ethic.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.515
I guarantee you,
a Newfoundlander

05:15.515 --> 05:17.817
will not be outworked.
- Michaels.

05:17.817 --> 05:20.019
Though I adored English
in school, I like words,

05:20.019 --> 05:21.454
but my true love
is math and science.

05:21.454 --> 05:23.089
I'm just gonna stop you
right there.

05:23.089 --> 05:26.159
Is he not the most boring person
you've ever heard in your life?

05:26.159 --> 05:27.794
- Pardon me?
- Like, is no one else

05:27.794 --> 05:29.228
havin' this issue,
you're sittin' here,

05:29.228 --> 05:32.298
you're listening to him talk,
you're trying to care,

05:32.298 --> 05:34.534
but you just can't seem
to give a fuck about

05:34.534 --> 05:36.035
a single word he says?
- Yeah.

05:36.035 --> 05:38.137
- Tell me how you
really feel, huh?
- I've been sittin' here

05:38.137 --> 05:39.439
listening to him talk
for a minute.

05:39.439 --> 05:40.807
He's been talking
for five seconds.

05:40.807 --> 05:42.241
Feels like I've been
sitting here listening

05:42.241 --> 05:43.343
to him talk for a year!

05:43.343 --> 05:45.445
Do you think there's any
girls on the bar side?

05:45.445 --> 05:46.813
Hmm?

05:46.813 --> 05:48.681
We're going to get
to your problem next, boys.

05:48.681 --> 05:50.983
Well, guess this
players only's

05:50.983 --> 05:54.153
been goin' a bit long
to not be lookin' at girls.

05:54.153 --> 05:56.356
(rap music)

05:56.356 --> 05:58.157
(Shoresy): If we were smart,
we would've started

05:58.157 --> 06:01.227
the players only where
there was beer and girls.

06:01.227 --> 06:03.596
It's not really
a players only anymore, though.

06:03.596 --> 06:04.931
Shut the fuck up, Fish.

06:04.931 --> 06:06.966
Now to figure out
who's the least dumb.

06:06.966 --> 06:08.968
(Frankie): Shoresy.
- Frankie!

06:08.968 --> 06:10.636
He hasn't heard from
his girlfriends.

06:10.636 --> 06:12.038
Girlfriends?

06:12.839 --> 06:14.407
He hasn't heard from
his girlfriends?

06:14.407 --> 06:15.742
(Dolo): No.

06:15.742 --> 06:17.610
Better hope they haven't
heard from each other!

06:17.610 --> 06:18.978
(Sanguinet): Players only, boys!

06:18.978 --> 06:20.813
At Reach For The Top,
they just fire a bunch

06:20.813 --> 06:22.281
of trivia questions at you.
- Alright,

06:22.281 --> 06:23.950
we'll fire a bunch
of trivia questions at you.

06:23.950 --> 06:25.918
Yeah, let's get firin' some
trivia questions here, boys.

06:25.918 --> 06:27.353
Let's go now.
- B'ys let's pick one

06:27.353 --> 06:30.156
good question so I can go
ask that girl to dance.

06:32.592 --> 06:33.926
(Shoresy): She's a bit young
but--

06:33.926 --> 06:37.029
Hey, tie your dick to your leg!

06:37.029 --> 06:38.865
Well, we pick one topic,

06:38.865 --> 06:40.967
and whoever talks
about it better wins.

06:41.701 --> 06:43.770
- What's the topic?
- Space.

06:43.770 --> 06:45.738
You wanna talk about space?

06:45.738 --> 06:48.775
Yeah! And whoever talks
about it better wins.

06:48.775 --> 06:51.210
You wanna see who can
talk about space better?

06:51.210 --> 06:54.180
- Yes, sir.
- Michaels, get us started.

06:54.180 --> 06:55.948
Well, first off,
I mean, it's huge.

06:55.948 --> 06:57.917
(Shoresy): What is?
- Space.

06:57.917 --> 07:00.052
You're opening with
space is huge?

07:00.052 --> 07:01.687
(Michaels): What'd you think
I was talking about?

07:01.687 --> 07:03.256
I dunno, a fuckin' planet.

07:03.256 --> 07:05.591
- A galaxy?
- How long is a light year?

07:05.591 --> 07:07.360
If he's opening
with space is huge,

07:07.360 --> 07:09.495
I can for sure talk
about space better.

07:09.495 --> 07:12.198
Okay, go ahead,
talk about space.

07:12.632 --> 07:15.368
The Earth revolves
around the sun.

07:15.368 --> 07:17.236
See? Already Shoresy's
talkin' about space

07:17.236 --> 07:19.205
better than I thought.
- Let's dance.

07:21.274 --> 07:24.210
Sorry b'ys, gotta
go see about a girl.

07:26.112 --> 07:27.980
Well, you run a great
players only, Sanger.

07:27.980 --> 07:29.415
You brought us
to where there's girls.

07:29.415 --> 07:31.417
Don't worry, we're gonna get
to the bottom of this,

07:31.417 --> 07:32.685
all right, Jim?
- Yeah.

07:32.685 --> 07:33.853
- Jim?
- Yes.

07:33.853 --> 07:35.087
- Jim?
- You can fit one million

07:35.087 --> 07:36.823
Earths inside the sun.
- You know,

07:36.823 --> 07:38.057
I don't think
it's any coincidence

07:38.057 --> 07:40.026
I start talkin' about space,
all of a sudden,

07:40.026 --> 07:41.661
no one wants to talk
about space anymore.

07:41.661 --> 07:42.995
And you were just
gettin' goin'.

07:42.995 --> 07:44.797
Don't see anyone wanting
to talk about space now.

07:44.797 --> 07:46.332
Well, you're right,
it is beyond massive.

07:46.332 --> 07:49.101
I had some great space words
I didn't even get to use.

07:49.101 --> 07:50.803
- Like what?
- Meta-galactic.

07:50.803 --> 07:53.606
- My guy!
- Inter-cosmic.

07:53.606 --> 07:55.908
- Those are pretty good ones.
- Well, you better think twice

07:55.908 --> 07:57.109
you wanna talk
about space with me.

07:57.109 --> 07:59.178
A full space suit
costs ya 12 sheets.

08:00.847 --> 08:02.315
- Michaels.
- Yeah?

08:02.315 --> 08:03.883
What's your problem?

08:06.085 --> 08:07.720
I'm the best goalie
in the league.

08:07.720 --> 08:08.955
Well then, why are you
walkin' around

08:08.955 --> 08:10.523
like someone ran over your dog?

08:10.523 --> 08:12.058
(sighs heavily)
- Look--

08:12.058 --> 08:13.993
You're really gonna inhale
and exhale like that?

08:13.993 --> 08:16.028
- Oh just--
- There, you just did it again.

08:16.028 --> 08:17.363
(sighs)
You don't even

08:17.363 --> 08:19.031
know you're doin' it!
- It's not success

08:19.031 --> 08:21.901
unless you have someone
to share it with.

08:23.703 --> 08:24.737
Hmm?

08:24.737 --> 08:26.472
I mean, I'm number one
in the league.

08:26.472 --> 08:27.940
We're number one. And soon,

08:27.940 --> 08:30.743
we're gonna be number one
in the league of all time.

08:30.743 --> 08:32.078
Mm-hmm.

08:32.078 --> 08:34.247
We're successful,
but it's just...

08:34.247 --> 08:35.848
it's not true success
if you don't have

08:35.848 --> 08:37.350
anyone to share it with.

08:40.186 --> 08:41.888
You're talkin' about
a broad, right?

08:41.888 --> 08:45.091
(Michaels sighs)
Don't fuckin' do that!

08:46.025 --> 08:48.294
(knock echoes on glass)

08:48.294 --> 08:50.363
(door creaks)

08:51.163 --> 08:52.498
- You're at my house.
- Yeah.

08:52.498 --> 08:55.034
- You fucking psycho.
- Politely knocking.

08:55.034 --> 08:56.502
You must have some
liquid courage.

08:56.502 --> 08:57.937
- Nope.
- You're not drunk?

08:57.937 --> 08:59.238
Well, yeah.

08:59.238 --> 09:01.340
Okay, go.
I honestly can't wait.

09:01.607 --> 09:02.875
(Shoresy sighs heavily)

09:02.875 --> 09:04.744
Do you really need to inhale
and exhale like that?

09:04.744 --> 09:07.313
- Whoa.
- What?

09:08.414 --> 09:11.951
It's not success unless you
have someone to share it with.

09:14.020 --> 09:15.354
What isn't?

09:15.888 --> 09:17.957
- What?
- Your success isn't?

09:17.957 --> 09:19.425
Isn't what?

09:19.425 --> 09:21.594
Success unless you have
someone to share it with?

09:21.594 --> 09:22.795
Can I start over?

09:22.795 --> 09:24.030
You're saying
you're successful.

09:24.030 --> 09:25.531
- Yep.
- 'Cause you're the best team

09:25.531 --> 09:26.532
in the league, I'm assuming.

09:26.532 --> 09:28.200
- Best team in the league ever.
- Not yet.

09:28.200 --> 09:29.335
But you're saying
it isn't success unless

09:29.335 --> 09:30.469
you have someone
to share it with?

09:30.469 --> 09:32.838
- Yeah.
- So what does that even mean?

09:33.439 --> 09:35.174
I'd love to tell
ya about my day.

09:35.174 --> 09:36.542
- Would you?
- Yeah.

09:36.542 --> 09:37.910
- What else?
- I'd love to see

09:37.910 --> 09:41.013
if I can somehow
make your life easier.

09:43.449 --> 09:46.152
- I almost believe you, dude.
- But?

09:46.152 --> 09:48.321
- You're a slut.
- I know you've fucked

09:48.321 --> 09:50.923
one or two before.
- That's how I know sluts talk.

09:50.923 --> 09:52.625
- What's it gonna take?
- Whadda ya got?

09:52.625 --> 09:54.026
Well, I'd tongue kiss

09:54.026 --> 09:56.162
a toaster to vacuum
your fuckin' car.

09:56.162 --> 09:58.130
- Yeah?
- Yeah. I'd walk the Kingsway

09:58.130 --> 10:00.533
with my pants at my ankles
to empty your dishwasher.

10:00.533 --> 10:02.868
- Now we're talkin'!
- I wanna empty your dishwasher

10:02.868 --> 10:04.270
so bad, you have no idea.

10:04.270 --> 10:06.872
- Say hi to Big Sexy for me.
- Yeah, all right.

10:06.872 --> 10:08.674
I wasn't thinkin'
I was comin' in or anything.

10:08.674 --> 10:11.410
Wasn't hopin' or anything.
- My kid's asleep in there.

10:11.410 --> 10:13.579
Yeah, don't wanna mess
that up or anything.

10:16.115 --> 10:17.650
You wanna go in the garage?

10:21.887 --> 10:23.623
(laughs)
Yeah, so you'll think

10:23.623 --> 10:25.424
you'd come knock on my door
anytime you're half cut

10:25.424 --> 10:27.026
and I'll wanna crawl
on top of ya?

10:27.026 --> 10:29.061
You are such a fuckin'
good time, woman.

10:29.061 --> 10:30.329
- Later.
- I'm gonna be

10:30.329 --> 10:31.797
thinkin' about you.
- Good night.

10:31.797 --> 10:33.566
And I usually prefer
the front door

10:33.566 --> 10:36.268
on a first date,
but you're the boss apple sauce!

10:36.268 --> 10:37.536
(laughs)

10:37.536 --> 10:39.105
(Sanguinet): Clock's tickin'
on the season

10:39.105 --> 10:40.573
and there's something real
shiny at the end of it.

10:40.573 --> 10:42.875
So, we need one of the boys
settin' the tone for the Jims

10:42.875 --> 10:44.343
so the Jims can
set the tone for us.

10:44.343 --> 10:47.013
Gotta set the tone boys.
Someone's gotta fuckin' set it.

10:47.013 --> 10:48.848
Practice round.
We'll start easy.

10:48.848 --> 10:50.950
What is the highest grossing
Canadian movie of all time?

10:50.950 --> 10:52.184
(buzzer beeps)
- Fubar!

10:52.184 --> 10:53.419
No, ya fuckin' idiot.

10:53.419 --> 10:55.187
- So fuckin' stupid.
- Guy's a fuckin' idiot.

10:55.187 --> 10:57.456
Yeah, it's the best Canadian
movie of all time.

10:57.456 --> 10:58.891
Incorrect. Michaels?

10:58.891 --> 11:01.260
- It's Bon Cop, Bad Cop.
- Correct.

11:01.260 --> 11:03.796
What multi-platinum band
hails from Hanna, Alberta?

11:03.796 --> 11:05.264
(buzzer beeps)
- Spirit of the West.

11:05.264 --> 11:07.033
Are you actually
a fuckin' idiot?

11:07.033 --> 11:08.534
He might actually be
fuckin' stupid.

11:08.534 --> 11:11.103
- So fuckin' dumb.
- Incorrect. Michaels?

11:11.103 --> 11:12.972
- It's Nickelback.
- Nickelback.

11:12.972 --> 11:14.840
Correct. I'm a World War I

11:14.840 --> 11:16.642
flying ace that
Toronto City Airport

11:16.642 --> 11:17.977
is named after. Who am I?

11:17.977 --> 11:19.378
(buzzer beeps)
- Avro Aero.

11:19.378 --> 11:21.514
Oh, my God, how is he
in this fuckin' competition?

11:21.514 --> 11:22.948
That's a plane.

11:22.948 --> 11:24.684
Well, he was askin'
for a plane, wasn't he?

11:24.684 --> 11:25.918
- No!
- He was askin' about

11:25.918 --> 11:27.820
a plane driver.
- A plane driver?

11:27.820 --> 11:29.188
- A pilot.
- Huh?

11:29.188 --> 11:30.990
- Lard Jeezus, b'y.
- Commercial planes

11:30.990 --> 11:33.793
can't go in reverse, eh?
- Incorrect. Michaels?

11:33.793 --> 11:35.227
It's Billy Bishop.

11:35.227 --> 11:36.796
(Sanguinet): Correct.
- You gotta push 'em.

11:36.796 --> 11:38.197
I think we've seen enough.

11:38.197 --> 11:40.499
Don't see no questions
on Newfoundland though, b'ys.

11:40.499 --> 11:42.635
No worries, we're used
to being excluded.

11:42.635 --> 11:44.670
Holy fuck, Sanger,
just give him a question

11:44.670 --> 11:47.039
about the Maritimes.
- Newfoundland ain't part

11:47.039 --> 11:48.541
of the Maritimes, b'ys!

11:48.541 --> 11:50.943
Okay, what is the name
of the popular Nova Scotia

11:50.943 --> 11:52.912
condiment made
of condensed milk,

11:52.912 --> 11:54.346
vinegar, and garlic?
- Oh, come on!

11:54.346 --> 11:56.348
Creamy garlic.
(players laugh)

11:58.250 --> 12:00.052
- Fuckin' idiot!
- Are you fuckin' serious?

12:00.052 --> 12:01.887
(Shoresy): Donair sauce!
- Correct!

12:01.887 --> 12:03.322
Who doesn't hear
fucking Nova Scotia

12:03.322 --> 12:05.958
and think donair?
- Halifax explosion was a doozy.

12:05.958 --> 12:07.626
What the fuck else does
Nova Scotia have?

12:07.626 --> 12:09.562
- Well, they got Sid the Kid.
- Trailer Park Boys.

12:09.562 --> 12:11.030
Well, Peggy's Cove's
a lovely time.

12:11.030 --> 12:12.631
Congrats, Michaels,

12:12.631 --> 12:14.800
you're going to jail
to play Reach For The Top!

12:14.800 --> 12:16.168
- Yes!
- Put us out of our misery.

12:16.168 --> 12:17.903
Guys, look, I just wanna
say that I respect--

12:17.903 --> 12:19.505
Sit the fuck down.
Shut the fuck up.

12:19.505 --> 12:20.706
Frankie?

12:24.777 --> 12:27.680
(speaking French)

13:44.557 --> 13:45.791
No.

13:55.634 --> 13:56.902
No.

14:05.911 --> 14:07.513
Eh, Celine.

14:12.985 --> 14:14.486
- Oui.
- Oui.

14:29.802 --> 14:31.670
Well, Frankie lives
in Ontario now,

14:31.670 --> 14:33.372
so I feel like
we should speak English

14:33.372 --> 14:35.674
so the girls there understand.
- I agree. They should know.

14:35.674 --> 14:37.676
We were asleep together
one night,

14:37.676 --> 14:40.446
and I woke up with something
between my toes.

14:40.446 --> 14:42.114
It was a Honey Nut Cheerio.

14:42.114 --> 14:44.183
- Oh.
- I would check Frankie's

14:44.183 --> 14:45.784
pockets before doing the wash,

14:45.784 --> 14:49.054
and one time, I pulled out
a Subway Philly cheese steak.

14:49.054 --> 14:50.956
- A footlong?
- Yeah.

14:50.956 --> 14:52.324
And a McDonald's apple pie.

14:53.292 --> 14:54.526
One time I came home,

14:54.526 --> 14:55.661
and the smoke alarms
were going off,

14:55.661 --> 14:57.696
and my dogs were
scratching at the door.

14:57.696 --> 14:59.899
Frankie had fallen asleep
with two pizza pops

14:59.899 --> 15:01.333
on the George Foreman Grill.

15:01.333 --> 15:03.035
Oh, Frankie.

15:03.035 --> 15:04.603
Your dogs must have
been scared sick.

15:04.603 --> 15:06.472
Yeah, they were sick
all right,

15:06.472 --> 15:08.107
from the pepperoni he picked up

15:08.107 --> 15:09.742
by the checkout
at Canadian Tire.

15:10.709 --> 15:13.712
You see, I thought
the cheating was bad.

15:13.712 --> 15:17.149
And it's clear that his diet
is what's really eating you.

15:17.149 --> 15:19.685
(speaking French)

15:39.805 --> 15:42.641
(rap music)

15:59.224 --> 16:00.659
(music ends abruptly)

16:00.659 --> 16:01.894
What?

16:02.461 --> 16:03.796
We got a problem.

16:03.796 --> 16:04.997
Of course we do.

16:09.468 --> 16:11.837
Did you just get fucked?
(footsteps approaching)

16:11.837 --> 16:14.006
- We got a problem.
- What's the problem?

16:14.006 --> 16:16.642
- Hey, look at her.
- What?

16:16.642 --> 16:18.444
- Doesn't she look like--
- Fuck you, Shoresy!

16:18.444 --> 16:19.712
(giggles)
- Fer what?

16:19.712 --> 16:21.380
- Like you just got fucked.
- You look like

16:21.380 --> 16:23.015
you just got fucked.
- No, she doesn't.

16:23.015 --> 16:24.383
- Okay.
- If anything,

16:24.383 --> 16:26.285
she looks like she's been
at home blastin' herself.

16:26.285 --> 16:28.153
(footsteps approaching)
- We've got a problem.

16:28.153 --> 16:29.621
Someone tell me the problem.

16:29.621 --> 16:31.557
- Frankie got caught.
- Oof!

16:31.557 --> 16:33.392
- Only a matter of time.
- How is he?

16:33.392 --> 16:34.960
- He doesn't know yet.
- Good.

16:34.960 --> 16:37.529
Keep it away from him
until after we play North Bay.

16:37.529 --> 16:39.031
The Quebecois
don't love him anymore.

16:39.031 --> 16:41.100
- Quebecois stand by their own.
- Well, someone loves him.

16:41.100 --> 16:42.368
His calendar's sold out.

16:42.368 --> 16:44.603
There's that calendar
bitin' me in the ass!

16:44.603 --> 16:46.672
- And back ordered.
- I don't fuckin' care!

16:46.672 --> 16:48.340
Well, you should.
That big Quebecer

16:48.340 --> 16:50.642
just got us 10K closer
to our 50K goal.

16:50.642 --> 16:52.311
- 20 to go.
- So dumb.

16:52.311 --> 16:53.445
You know what?
Fuck you, Shoresy.

16:53.445 --> 16:55.080
- Fer what?
- I send you off

16:55.080 --> 16:56.515
to put out some fires,
and instead,

16:56.515 --> 16:58.384
you come back with a new one?
- No, one's out.

16:58.384 --> 17:00.586
So, you came back with
this one in place of another.

17:00.586 --> 17:02.287
Same amount of fires, slut.

17:02.287 --> 17:04.056
These floors could
use a sweep, Ziig.

17:04.056 --> 17:06.925
Which one don't I have
to worry about anymore?

17:06.925 --> 17:09.361
(indistinct shouting)

17:09.962 --> 17:11.597
(Quiz Master, deadpan):
Welcome to this week's

17:11.597 --> 17:13.499
Reach For The Top league play.

17:13.499 --> 17:15.434
Quiet on the block, please.

17:15.434 --> 17:17.803
(shouting continues)

17:20.239 --> 17:21.840
Thank you.

17:21.840 --> 17:25.310
Jim, Jim, and Jim
have a new teammate today.

17:25.310 --> 17:28.414
This is Michaels.
Let's all welcome him.

17:28.414 --> 17:30.182
(Inmate 1): I'll fuck you
'til you love me, hoe!

17:30.182 --> 17:31.917
(Inmate 2): C'mon,
fuck me up the ass!

17:31.917 --> 17:33.819
(shouting continues)

17:33.819 --> 17:35.654
Thank you.

17:35.654 --> 17:38.424
I understand that Jim, Jim,
Jim, and Michaels

17:38.424 --> 17:40.526
also have a new team name.

17:40.526 --> 17:41.894
Since we have a new teammate,

17:41.894 --> 17:43.529
we thought we should
have a new team name.

17:43.529 --> 17:45.531
We'll no longer be
called Iroquiz.

17:45.531 --> 17:47.733
And what shall we call you?

17:48.767 --> 17:50.069
Algonquiz.

17:50.069 --> 17:51.570
Very well.

17:51.570 --> 17:53.038
In an effort to put
what happened

17:53.038 --> 17:54.573
to Correctional Officer Seth

17:54.573 --> 17:56.675
at the hands of inmate Pinky
behind us...

17:56.675 --> 17:58.377
(Inmate 1): I'll fuck you
'til you love me, hoe!

17:58.377 --> 18:00.112
...we decided to change
our name as well.

18:00.112 --> 18:02.014
Hence turning over a new leaf.

18:02.014 --> 18:03.816
And what will that be?

18:05.084 --> 18:07.586
Tropic of Answer.

18:08.187 --> 18:09.321
Very well.

18:09.321 --> 18:11.156
Let the match begin.

18:11.156 --> 18:13.158
Algonquiz, are you ready?

18:13.158 --> 18:14.660
- Yeah.
- Yes.

18:14.660 --> 18:15.994
Good luck, everyone.

18:15.994 --> 18:17.896
Good luck to everybody involved.
- Tropic of Answer,

18:17.896 --> 18:19.198
are you ready?

18:21.200 --> 18:22.668
We begin.

18:24.303 --> 18:26.405
Which Canadian funny man
was part owner

18:26.405 --> 18:28.340
of the Toronto Argonauts
in the 1990s?

18:28.340 --> 18:30.175
(buzzers beep)

18:30.909 --> 18:33.445
Um, John Candy?

18:33.445 --> 18:35.280
- Correct.
- Okay.

18:35.280 --> 18:37.249
Which Ontario city
did Sam Panapoulos

18:37.249 --> 18:38.817
invent Hawaiian pizza in?

18:38.817 --> 18:40.319
(buzzers beep)

18:40.319 --> 18:41.420
Um, Chatham.

18:41.420 --> 18:42.788
Correct.

18:42.788 --> 18:44.723
What year did
Newfoundland Labrador

18:44.723 --> 18:46.158
officially join Canada?

18:46.158 --> 18:47.226
(buzzers beep)

18:47.226 --> 18:48.760
1949.

18:48.760 --> 18:52.831

isn't it?

19:32.738 --> 19:34.940
Any significance
to that number for you?

19:34.940 --> 19:36.275
Sentimental value?

You fuckin' settle him down,
