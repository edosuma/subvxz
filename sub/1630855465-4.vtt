[evil music playing]

00:16.516 --> 00:17.892
Hmm.

00:17.976 --> 00:21.354
[Mr. Dr. Eggman] Gah.
All this debris is slowing us down!

00:21.438 --> 00:23.857
Someone take care of it. Now!

00:26.067 --> 00:28.153
[babbling]

00:32.032 --> 00:33.283
[Mr. Dr. Eggman] Hmm.

00:36.911 --> 00:39.622
[keys clicking]

00:39.706 --> 00:42.417
Mothership, play audiobook.

00:42.500 --> 00:45.170
[Mothership Siri] Playing
The Art of World Domination.

00:45.253 --> 00:48.590
Chapter One. Posture matters.

00:48.673 --> 00:49.799
[Nine scoffs]

00:49.883 --> 00:51.801
Mothership, stop audiobook!

00:51.885 --> 00:54.053
Smirk while you can, rat.

00:54.137 --> 00:58.558
Soon the Chaos Council will have
a third Shard in our grasp.

00:58.641 --> 01:01.853
Pray we still require your assistance
when that happens.

01:01.936 --> 01:05.398
As long as Sonic is out there,
you'll need all the help you can get.

01:05.482 --> 01:08.610
Zip it! The only noise I want to hear

01:08.693 --> 01:11.529
is the sound of you
upgrading the shatterdrive

01:11.613 --> 01:13.698
to contain more prism energy!

01:13.782 --> 01:15.033
[ship rumbles]

01:16.910 --> 01:18.453
Oh, for the love of--

01:18.536 --> 01:20.789
Don't get any funny ideas.

01:21.956 --> 01:23.875
I wouldn't dream of it.

01:27.712 --> 01:28.630
[device chimes]

01:28.713 --> 01:30.590
Nine to Sonic, can you hear me?

01:30.673 --> 01:32.675
Nine to Sonic, can you hear me!?

01:36.721 --> 01:38.932
[Dread] Last chance, Blue!

01:39.015 --> 01:40.475
The Shard,

01:40.558 --> 01:42.268
or your life!

01:43.102 --> 01:45.897
-[device chimes]
-[Nine] Sonic! Can you hear me?

01:45.980 --> 01:47.106
Are you okay?

01:47.190 --> 01:50.360
He be anything but okay, me boyo.

01:50.443 --> 01:52.946
-[Nine] Who was that?
-Sorry, little buddy,

01:53.029 --> 01:55.740
I'm gonna need to call you back
in like five--

01:55.824 --> 01:57.575
That treasure be mine.

01:57.659 --> 01:58.827
Ten minutes.

01:59.786 --> 02:02.789
[theme music playing]

02:08.753 --> 02:11.798
Dread, what are you doing?
This wasn't part of the plan!

02:11.881 --> 02:14.968
The plan's changed when you deserted us.

02:15.051 --> 02:16.261
Aah!

02:16.344 --> 02:17.512
[grunts]

02:17.595 --> 02:22.183
Deserted you?
Wait, is that why you're all so mad?

02:22.267 --> 02:24.727
Dread, tell them! I was coming right back.

02:24.811 --> 02:26.771
Not how it looked to us.

02:26.855 --> 02:28.815
You know what? That stings.

02:28.898 --> 02:32.610
Especially since I'm standing right here,
proving that I did come back!

02:32.694 --> 02:34.779
He makes a good point.

02:34.863 --> 02:36.281
Look, I'm not a traitor,

02:36.364 --> 02:39.367
but right now, I need to take this shard
and get-- Hey!

02:39.450 --> 02:40.910
More lies!

02:40.994 --> 02:44.455
Respect. My. Boundaries!

02:44.539 --> 02:47.417
I expected Dread to take this hard,
but what's with the rest of you?

02:47.500 --> 02:50.920
You're a lousy traitor
who abandoned your crew in battle!

02:51.004 --> 02:52.797
I didn't abandon you!

02:52.881 --> 02:54.799
Dread told me to get the Shard,
and he w--

02:54.883 --> 02:56.634
He's lying!

02:56.718 --> 02:59.095
Now give me the treasure.

02:59.178 --> 03:01.180
Well, when you put it that way.

03:02.682 --> 03:03.808
[blows a raspberry]

03:05.768 --> 03:09.105
After him!
Get this bucket of bolts in the air!

03:09.188 --> 03:12.734
This ship can move,
but is too damaged to fly, captain.

03:12.817 --> 03:15.320
Until she can do the repairs.

03:15.403 --> 03:17.447
Argh. Prepare the crew.

03:17.530 --> 03:20.366
We're taking this thing down.

The blue rat is abandoning ship!

03:27.999 --> 03:29.083
Oh,

03:29.167 --> 03:30.627
for the love of quiche!

03:30.710 --> 03:32.754
Do you have to do that right now?

03:32.837 --> 03:34.380
It relaxes me.

03:34.464 --> 03:37.050
Besides,
it's not like I can do anything else

03:37.133 --> 03:39.010
with our ship dead in the water.

03:39.093 --> 03:41.221
Thank goodness
the rest of the Chaos Council

03:41.304 --> 03:43.473
doesn't know about our "predicament".

03:43.556 --> 03:46.184
[Mr. Dr. Eggman]
Yes, well, they are nimrods.

03:46.267 --> 03:47.685
[Dr. Don't] We're patched in.

03:47.769 --> 03:50.813
[Mr. Dr. Eggman] Oh! Uh, ahem.
Mothership to Yolkomotive,

03:50.897 --> 03:53.024
we're en-route, are you in position?

03:53.107 --> 03:54.525
I repeat en-route.

03:54.609 --> 03:57.362
[panicked gibberish] No problems here!

03:57.445 --> 04:01.699
We'll be there with bells on,
with the Shard in our possession.

04:01.783 --> 04:02.742
[radio buzzes]

04:02.825 --> 04:05.203
Urgh! We need to move!

04:05.286 --> 04:08.456
How much longer until we're operational?

04:08.539 --> 04:11.292
I've already programmed them
to do the repairs.

04:11.376 --> 04:13.836
Just relax and do your yogurt.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.255
It's yoga!

04:18.258 --> 04:22.345
Ah! I'll never hit top speed
juggling this thing around!

04:25.848 --> 04:28.559
All this water, it's just not natural.

04:28.643 --> 04:31.771
I always feel like something's gonna
come up out of the darkness and--

04:31.854 --> 04:32.981
What is that?

04:33.064 --> 04:34.899
[Sonic yelling]

04:34.983 --> 04:36.609
[all yelling]

04:36.693 --> 04:39.904
Whoa!

04:40.321 --> 04:41.155
Ah!

04:44.575 --> 04:46.661
I knew we'd catch him by surprise.

04:46.744 --> 04:48.955
Captain, the Kracken is still damaged,

04:49.038 --> 04:52.166
and this type of extreme maneuvering
is not advisable.

04:52.250 --> 04:54.669
If she falls apart, I know who ta blame.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.380
Everyone on deck!

04:57.463 --> 05:00.842
And keep your eyes peeled
for that blue treasure thief!

05:17.066 --> 05:18.026
[grunts]

05:21.779 --> 05:22.739
Huh?

05:22.822 --> 05:24.907
Something definitely hit us.

05:24.991 --> 05:26.868
Look out the window, Dr. Don't,

05:26.951 --> 05:29.370
something is always hitting us!

05:29.454 --> 05:31.873
Dr. Babble is doing the best he can.

05:31.956 --> 05:34.042
[babbling]

05:35.793 --> 05:39.047
[babbling continues]

05:39.130 --> 05:41.632
Why does he get to play games?
He's a noob.

05:41.716 --> 05:44.135
Because I need you to drive the ship.

05:44.218 --> 05:45.470
[bang]

05:57.482 --> 05:58.483
[Dr. Don't] Ugh!

05:58.566 --> 06:01.736
Bad RNG.
I'm shutting it down before we blow.

06:01.819 --> 06:04.489
Fine! Send out a repair squad as well.

06:04.572 --> 06:06.532
We don't have time for this!

06:10.661 --> 06:13.372
We'd better tell the others
we're going to be delayed.

06:13.456 --> 06:14.832
Mothership to Yolkomotive,

06:14.916 --> 06:17.293
we've hit a snag! Slight delay.

06:17.376 --> 06:20.296
D-delayed!? What's takin' ya so long?!

06:20.379 --> 06:21.756
We're in position!

06:21.839 --> 06:24.300
We've been at the checkpoint for hours!

06:28.638 --> 06:31.599
-[Nine] Nine to Sonic! Are you there?
-Nine?

06:31.682 --> 06:34.769
Huh, finally. Tell me you have the Shard.

06:34.852 --> 06:38.439
You know it! Now all I gotta do is
get this baby to the void.

06:38.523 --> 06:41.025
What are you waiting for?
You have to hurry.

06:41.109 --> 06:42.902
The mothership has been stalled somehow

06:42.985 --> 06:45.613
-but it's on it's way!
-Haha, I'm trying,

06:45.696 --> 06:48.074
but I've got a bit of a pirate problem
at the moment.

06:48.157 --> 06:50.034
We find me treasure

06:50.118 --> 06:52.036
or ye all be walking the plank!

06:54.997 --> 06:56.958
Ugh, Dread's really losing it.

06:57.041 --> 07:00.128
[Nine] Forget the pirates.
Our reality is at stake.

07:00.211 --> 07:01.462
Stay on mission.

07:01.546 --> 07:03.714
Copy that, stay on mission.

07:07.468 --> 07:08.302
[croaks]

07:09.053 --> 07:10.888
You too, Catfish?

07:20.606 --> 07:23.526
You'll never escape with me treasure!

07:23.609 --> 07:25.695
Open fire!

07:34.370 --> 07:36.789
This totally seemed like
it was going to be easy.

07:36.873 --> 07:39.459
Get the Shard and run fast,
which I'm awesome at--

07:39.542 --> 07:41.919
-Gyah!
-[Shadow] Who are you talking to?!

07:42.003 --> 07:43.796
I can see you have the Shard.

07:43.880 --> 07:46.174
Run faster and get out of there!

07:46.257 --> 07:48.843
Turns out it's hard
to get up to full speed on water.

07:48.926 --> 07:50.261
Even with these kicks.

07:53.347 --> 07:56.058
Not to mention
having pirates blasting at you!

07:56.142 --> 07:57.810
Then go where they can't
blast you.

07:57.894 --> 08:00.897
I need solid ground.
And I know just where to get it!

08:00.980 --> 08:04.108
By the time that ship gets here,
I'll be a blip on the horizon.

08:04.942 --> 08:06.235
What was that about
a blip?

08:07.987 --> 08:11.240
Target acquired. Missiles locked.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.701
You've been nicked, me hearty.

08:13.784 --> 08:15.953
And I'm coming for ye.

08:20.249 --> 08:21.125
Gulp.

08:28.966 --> 08:31.552
You guys are gonna feel
really bad about this later

08:31.636 --> 08:34.555
when you think back and remember
how awful you were treating me,

08:34.639 --> 08:36.182
when I'm only trying to help!

08:36.974 --> 08:37.808
Fire!

08:38.476 --> 08:40.478
Let's just say I'm glad I'm not
you guys.

08:40.561 --> 08:43.064
That guilt's going to be unbearable!

08:43.147 --> 08:45.066
[yelling]

08:47.568 --> 08:48.402
[gasp]

08:48.486 --> 08:50.488
Close one. Uwaaagh!

08:50.988 --> 08:54.367
Ahhgh, hold still, you slippery eel!

08:54.450 --> 08:58.037
The missiles are locked
to Sonic's energy signature, captain.

08:58.120 --> 09:00.540
He won't be able to outrun them for long.

09:06.254 --> 09:08.881
Why does everything
have to be so difficult!?

09:13.928 --> 09:15.388
Fire again!

09:16.597 --> 09:17.848
Uh-oh!

09:19.767 --> 09:22.228
[screaming in slow-motion]

09:22.311 --> 09:26.107
[all screaming in slow-motion]

09:31.279 --> 09:33.155
Oh, yeah!

09:35.866 --> 09:39.620
Arr! That blue treasure thief
will pay for this!

09:41.539 --> 09:42.540
You okay?

09:44.375 --> 09:48.170
No one has ever asked if I was okay.

09:48.254 --> 09:52.008
I am to be treated as a tool, not a--

09:52.091 --> 09:55.177
Friend? I know the feeling.

09:55.261 --> 09:59.515
All I do is follow The Dread's orders,
and where has that led me?

09:59.599 --> 10:01.851
[Dread] Come on, you lazy sea dogs!

10:01.934 --> 10:04.562
We gotta get after that blue menace!

10:04.645 --> 10:08.274
We're gonna get me treasure back
even if it kills ye!

10:22.288 --> 10:23.456
[robots chattering]

10:25.958 --> 10:30.504
[robots chattering continues]

10:30.588 --> 10:31.839
Huh?

10:37.595 --> 10:38.429
What was that?

10:41.641 --> 10:42.892
What the?!

10:45.186 --> 10:48.064
What's going on in here?!
Are you playing a game?

10:48.147 --> 10:50.066
Where are we at with the engine repairs?

10:50.149 --> 10:52.318
There's... There's something out there!

10:52.401 --> 10:53.903
[Mr. Dr. Eggman] 65%!

10:53.986 --> 10:57.782
That's well within the operational range!
Fooling around with so much at stake!

11:02.828 --> 11:03.913
[Dr. Don't] Aghhh!

11:03.996 --> 11:06.374
I'm mad and disappointed!

11:17.051 --> 11:19.637
What are we waitin' for? Let's attack!

11:19.720 --> 11:23.432
-We can get the Shard and call it a day.
-All in good time.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.393
Let them tire each other out.

11:25.476 --> 11:28.437
A divided enemy is an easy one to conquer.

11:28.521 --> 11:31.399
Bah! Your whole generation
is afraid to work.

11:31.482 --> 11:33.901
And all your yogurt won't change a thing!

11:33.984 --> 11:36.612
For the last time, it's yoga!

11:36.695 --> 11:37.822
Yoga!

11:37.905 --> 11:40.533
[deep breath]

11:40.616 --> 11:43.536
Now that I am centered,
let's finish the job.

11:43.619 --> 11:44.829
I'm getting my suit!

11:48.040 --> 11:51.544
Hoo-yeah! Pop-pop's got the wheel!

11:56.340 --> 11:57.758
Oh! Thanks.

11:59.301 --> 12:02.388
Captain,
I have restored flight capability.

12:02.471 --> 12:04.557
Perhaps we should leave the water?

12:04.640 --> 12:06.600
Nay, I've got to stay low

12:06.684 --> 12:09.228
to keep an eye on me treasure. Fire!

12:13.482 --> 12:14.942
Not even close!

12:17.236 --> 12:19.196
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

12:23.492 --> 12:24.785
Oh, no.

12:29.457 --> 12:30.749
At last.

12:40.718 --> 12:42.595
I'll only ask this once.

12:42.678 --> 12:44.305
Give me back the Shard.

12:44.388 --> 12:46.557
You'll have to do more than ask.

12:46.640 --> 12:49.977
If ye want the Shard you'll have to--

12:51.437 --> 12:52.480
Fight for it?

12:53.564 --> 12:55.608
Bring it on, Blue.

13:00.237 --> 13:02.323
[all screams]

13:02.907 --> 13:03.741
No!

13:05.951 --> 13:07.119
What was that?

13:07.536 --> 13:09.205
Captain! We're hit!

13:10.080 --> 13:11.790
[Dr. Deep] No need to fight, boys.

13:13.125 --> 13:15.544
The Shard is mine.

13:15.628 --> 13:18.756
Destroy them all, every one of them!

13:25.095 --> 13:25.930
Ha-ha!

13:26.722 --> 13:27.556
Aye.

13:30.184 --> 13:32.394
[everyone enthusiastic walla]

13:41.237 --> 13:42.071
Yes.

13:48.202 --> 13:49.370
Hyah!

14:07.471 --> 14:09.598
-You good?
-Thank you.

14:09.682 --> 14:11.183
Uh... you're welcome?

14:15.062 --> 14:16.272
Ouch!

14:26.365 --> 14:27.908
-We're overmatched.
-"We"?

14:27.992 --> 14:31.161
I left you all once,
and I'm not making that mistake again.

14:31.245 --> 14:32.997
-Where's the Shard?
-There!

14:33.664 --> 14:35.624
[evil laughter]

14:49.972 --> 14:51.515
Dread is abandoning ship?

14:52.141 --> 14:56.020
[Dr. Done It] Gah!
The pirate's got the Shard! Get him

15:00.608 --> 15:03.652
The Shard must not fall
into the Council's hands.

15:03.736 --> 15:04.570
But you--

15:04.653 --> 15:06.864
Will be fine after that rock is gone.

15:06.947 --> 15:08.282
Get after him, Sonic.

15:19.501 --> 15:22.087
Dread! Is this who you really are?

15:22.171 --> 15:24.173
A coward who abandons his crew?

15:24.256 --> 15:26.800
A captain makes sacrifices!

15:35.351 --> 15:38.479
Time to show off my warrior pose.

15:43.734 --> 15:46.487
[Dr. Done It] Gah!
Would you just grow up and attack?!

15:46.570 --> 15:49.490
[Dr. Deep] I'm trying to be dramatic!

15:49.573 --> 15:52.284
[screaming]

15:52.368 --> 15:53.327
[chuckles]

15:56.830 --> 16:00.376
Dread! Where are you going,
what's your plan?

16:00.459 --> 16:02.252
I don't need a "plan"!

16:02.336 --> 16:04.880
As long as I've got me beauty!

16:04.964 --> 16:06.006
Ugh.

16:15.432 --> 16:16.976
Oh, yeah!

16:20.938 --> 16:23.857
Sorry, Dread,
but I've got a shatter-verse to save.

16:27.736 --> 16:29.571
-Ohhh, lemme--
-[beep]

16:30.656 --> 16:34.159
[heroic music playing]

16:40.708 --> 16:44.294
Oh, if I had my Death Laser.

16:44.378 --> 16:46.714
Land! Sweet, solid land!

16:46.797 --> 16:49.425
Finally, I can get some traction
under these kicks!

16:49.508 --> 16:51.051
Time to get outta here.

16:53.929 --> 16:56.181
It's working! Yes!

16:57.099 --> 16:57.933
What the--?

17:05.274 --> 17:07.568
Thanks for the head's up, Shadow!

17:17.453 --> 17:18.495
Nine?!

17:18.579 --> 17:20.039
Sonic, get out of here!

17:21.457 --> 17:22.583
No!

17:22.666 --> 17:26.128
What?! You still have the Shard?
Doctors, where are you?

17:26.211 --> 17:28.130
What have you been doing
all this time?

17:28.213 --> 17:30.215
Oh, cool your jets, sonny!

17:30.299 --> 17:32.801
Deep's just cleaning up a few barnacles.

17:32.885 --> 17:34.303
We'll be there shortly!

17:34.386 --> 17:37.723
Do I have to do everything myself?

17:37.806 --> 17:40.017
Playtime is over.

17:40.100 --> 17:42.144
Give me the Shard.

17:43.395 --> 17:44.438
Make me.

17:46.982 --> 17:48.776
No, she be mine!

17:48.859 --> 17:50.819
-Dread!
-Shoot the pirate.

17:52.780 --> 17:53.614
Aah.

17:57.034 --> 17:57.993
[groans]

17:58.077 --> 18:00.621
I said playtime is over.

18:04.333 --> 18:05.292
[evil laughter]

18:09.046 --> 18:11.006
[evil laughter]

18:13.258 --> 18:15.511
Excellent work, Doctors.

18:15.594 --> 18:18.180
It's amazing what my cohorts and I can do

18:18.263 --> 18:19.848
when we work together.

18:20.766 --> 18:21.934
I'll make this simple.

18:22.017 --> 18:26.355
Hand over the Shard,
or say goodbye to your friends forever.

18:33.445 --> 18:35.572
Don't. I am expendable.

18:36.406 --> 18:39.159
Well, I'm not! Give 'em the blasted rock!

18:39.243 --> 18:41.745
Well? Last chance.

18:43.747 --> 18:44.581
[sighs]

18:44.665 --> 18:47.209
Fine. When you put it that way.

18:47.292 --> 18:49.253
Sonic, no!

18:52.464 --> 18:53.674
You want the Shard?

18:53.757 --> 18:56.135
You're gonna have to get it yourself!

18:56.218 --> 18:58.470
No! Get the Shard!

18:58.554 --> 18:59.930
And destroy him!

19:13.777 --> 19:18.198
[grunting]

19:29.293 --> 19:30.377
Oh, no!

19:30.961 --> 19:33.547
[screaming]

19:35.048 --> 19:38.343
-You two make quite the team.
-Aye, we do.

19:38.427 --> 19:42.139
Now, if you'll excuse me, I've gotta fly.

19:47.311 --> 19:49.813
[Black Rose]
Everyone! Get to your stations!

19:54.484 --> 19:56.153
[Sonic] The Mothership!

19:56.236 --> 19:57.279
It's leaving!

20:03.327 --> 20:04.328
[evil laugh]

20:07.206 --> 20:09.917
-[screaming]
-[thud]

20:13.378 --> 20:14.546
Need a lift?

20:14.630 --> 20:15.839
You know it.

20:17.049 --> 20:18.717
You must stop them, Sonic.

20:18.800 --> 20:23.222
If the Council acquires all the shards,
total annihilation is inevitable.

20:23.305 --> 20:26.016
Well, doesn't that sound terrifying.

20:26.099 --> 20:27.726
[Sails Tails] Sonic, look!

20:33.440 --> 20:34.733
Dread?

20:44.576 --> 20:45.661
Thanks for the lift!

20:48.997 --> 20:49.998
Wahhh!

21:00.384 --> 21:02.469
[Mr. Dr. Eggman]
Set a course for New Yoke.

21:02.552 --> 21:05.764
We've got a rebellion to quash.

21:05.847 --> 21:10.269
[diabolical laughter]

21:12.521 --> 21:14.648
[gasping]

21:16.900 --> 21:20.237
[gasping, evil laughter]

21:23.073 --> 21:26.034
[theme music playing]
