11:42.234 --> 11:44.637
Get that hang glider ready!

11:44.637 --> 11:45.905
Hang glider?!

11:45.905 --> 11:47.840
The Pig 1&2:
He's ready to go, Sir.

11:47.840 --> 11:51.243
Oh boy, this
is gonna be great!

11:51.243 --> 11:53.012
Here's the scene.

11:53.012 --> 11:55.548
You're gonna go
soaring off this cliff...

11:55.548 --> 11:58.050
High, high, high
above the clouds.

11:58.050 --> 11:59.885
Yeaaahoooo!

11:59.885 --> 12:01.954
Splashing the
cologne on your face.

12:01.954 --> 12:04.924
Then you'll bring
this baby down... gently,

12:04.924 --> 12:07.560
right in front
of that camera. See?

12:07.560 --> 12:09.195
And then you'll say...

12:09.195 --> 12:11.797
Now, that's success!

12:11.797 --> 12:13.866
You got it! Ready?

12:13.866 --> 12:15.668
And... action.

12:20.239 --> 12:23.776
Smile, Raccoon!
I said smile!

12:25.044 --> 12:26.112
Oooh-oh-ho!

12:27.747 --> 12:29.782
Yaaaaaah!

12:29.782 --> 12:31.217
Aaaaaaaah!

12:31.217 --> 12:33.919
Uh!

12:33.919 --> 12:37.223
Now... that's success!

12:37.223 --> 12:38.891
Cut!! That's a take!

12:40.426 --> 12:42.328
I just don't
understand how Bert

12:42.328 --> 12:45.064
can compromise his
ideals like that?

12:45.064 --> 12:47.767
Well,
Bert will be Bert.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.668
He just wants to be a star.

12:50.703 --> 12:53.105
(sighs) I suppose...
Now Ralph,

12:53.105 --> 12:55.474
when we see him,
don't say anything

12:55.474 --> 12:57.309
about the smell of that stuff.

12:57.309 --> 12:59.478
You know how it set
him off last time.

12:59.478 --> 13:01.147
Okay, okay...

13:03.048 --> 13:06.886
Hey,
I don't know about this, guys.

13:06.886 --> 13:09.922
I mean, I like motorcycles
and all, but,

13:09.922 --> 13:13.225
isn't leaping over a canyon
on one a little dangerous?

13:13.225 --> 13:15.828
Pig 2: That's the price
of stardom, Sir.

13:15.828 --> 13:18.497
Yeah!! Stardom.

13:18.497 --> 13:19.999
Action!!!

13:19.999 --> 13:23.269
Pig 1: Success,
scene two, take one.

13:24.603 --> 13:26.572
Yeeeehaaaa!

13:29.575 --> 13:32.578
Aaaaaaaah!

13:32.578 --> 13:34.847
Haaa-haaaaa!

13:38.751 --> 13:41.086
Now... that's...

13:41.086 --> 13:42.588
Success!

13:42.588 --> 13:44.690
Cut!! That's a take!

13:50.296 --> 13:52.364
Now for...
Now for nothing!

13:52.364 --> 13:54.266
I was told I was gonna sing!

13:54.266 --> 13:57.636
I have to be a star.
When do I get to perform?

13:57.636 --> 14:00.306
Singing?!
Yeah, singing!

14:00.306 --> 14:03.375
Well...
right now!

14:03.375 --> 14:05.811
(giggles) At last!

14:05.811 --> 14:08.280
This is the song
you're gonna sing!

14:08.280 --> 14:09.949

15:09.341 --> 15:11.210
We were on
our way to band practice.

you'd see the light...

as much fun without Bert.

16:06.799 --> 16:08.000
Cedric/Sophia: Yeah!

16:08.000 --> 16:11.270
Well, shall
we get down to rehearsing?

16:11.270 --> 16:13.172
I suppose so...

16:13.172 --> 16:14.173
Cedric/Sophia: Yeah.

16:15.174 --> 16:17.643
I wish I hadn't
agreed to do this.

16:17.643 --> 16:20.746
It isn't nearly as much fun as
I thought it was going to be.

16:20.746 --> 16:23.482
Besides... I miss the gang.

16:23.749 --> 16:27.586

16:38.197 --> 16:41.667
Time for the most
dangerous scene of all!

16:41.667 --> 16:43.502
Ohhh no, don't tell me...

16:43.502 --> 16:45.104
Let me guess...

16:45.104 --> 16:47.639
you want me to roller skate
over the bridge

16:47.639 --> 16:52.177
on greased roller skates while
carrying a 10 ton weight.

16:52.177 --> 16:54.113
(chuckles) No,

16:54.113 --> 16:56.048
What I've got in mind
is something

16:56.048 --> 16:57.883
far, far more dangerous.

16:57.883 --> 17:00.119
Love!
Love?!

17:00.119 --> 17:01.954
Our market research shows

17:01.954 --> 17:04.723
that success in romance
is perceived

17:04.723 --> 17:07.059
as the greatest success of all.

17:07.393 --> 17:10.029
Raccoon,
meet your leading lady!

17:10.029 --> 17:13.565
Oh boy, this is
more dangerous

17:13.565 --> 17:15.534
than greased roller skates!

17:15.534 --> 17:17.002
Yuck!

17:17.002 --> 17:20.239
Enough talk!
I want to see some action!

17:20.239 --> 17:22.641
Now you're to come over
that mountain peak

17:22.641 --> 17:25.978
singing the song
of success. Of course!

17:25.978 --> 17:27.880
Then you'll leap over that rock,

17:27.880 --> 17:30.082
sweep your leading
lady into your arms,

17:30.082 --> 17:31.750
and walk across the bridge.

17:31.750 --> 17:35.087
Once that's done, you step
into that hot air balloon,

17:35.087 --> 17:39.425
then, off into the sunset
you sail, ha-ha!

17:39.425 --> 17:42.394
