IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,

00:07.675 --> 00:11.412
SEXUALLY-BASED OFFENSES ARE
CONSIDERED ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:11.445 --> 00:12.646
IN NEW YORK CITY,

00:12.680 --> 00:14.548
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES
WHO INVESTIGATE

00:14.582 --> 00:17.151
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES
ARE MEMBERS OF AN ELITE SQUAD

00:17.185 --> 00:19.220
KNOWN AS
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:19.253 --> 00:22.190
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:22.223 --> 00:23.357
- AW, COME ON.

00:23.391 --> 00:25.226
- NO. NO,
I DON'T WANT ANY BEER, PLEASE.

00:25.259 --> 00:27.061
- AW, COME ON.
DRINKING'S FUN.

00:27.095 --> 00:28.396
EVERYBODY'S DOING IT.

00:28.429 --> 00:31.065
- UH, NO. I FEEL--I FEEL SICK.
PLEASE, PLEASE, NO. I--

00:31.099 --> 00:32.400
- I'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU.

00:32.433 --> 00:34.135
- YOU WILL?
- YEAH, OF COURSE.

00:34.168 --> 00:35.503
HAVE ANOTHER ONE.

00:35.536 --> 00:37.171
- NO, JUST LEAVE ME--
- COME ON. JUST COME HERE.

00:37.205 --> 00:39.340
- [whimpers]

00:39.373 --> 00:41.409
- D--
DOES THIS MEAN YOU LIKE ME?

00:41.442 --> 00:44.412
- OF COURSE I LIKE YOU.
- I--OKAY, UM--

00:44.445 --> 00:46.414
- YOU WANT SOME MORE?

00:46.447 --> 00:48.449
- [grunts]
- THERE YOU GO.

00:49.583 --> 00:51.152
- ELLA!

00:51.185 --> 00:52.320
HELP!
SOMEBODY HELP!

00:52.353 --> 00:54.455
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.
EVERYONE STAY SEATED.

00:54.488 --> 00:56.090
ARTURO,
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?

00:56.124 --> 00:57.791
- I DIDN'T DO IT.
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

00:57.825 --> 01:00.528
- MR. CORDOVA, CALL THE NURSE
AND THE MONSIGNOR.

01:00.561 --> 01:02.296
- YES, SISTER.

01:02.330 --> 01:06.400
- ELLA?
ELLA?

01:06.434 --> 01:08.569
- BENSON, AMARO.

01:08.602 --> 01:12.140
THIS IS MONSIGNOR KIAGA FROM--
- BLESSED SAVIOR.

01:12.173 --> 01:14.875
- NICK? NYPD FINALLY
GOT YOU INTO A SUIT?

01:14.908 --> 01:19.380
- [laughs] YEAH.
UH, IS EVERYTHING OKAY, FATHER?

01:19.413 --> 01:21.149
- I'M NOT SURE.

01:21.182 --> 01:23.517
- A 13-YEAR-OLD FROM
HIS MIDDLE SCHOOL IS PREGNANT.

01:23.551 --> 01:25.686
- SHE HAVE A BOYFRIEND?
- NO.

01:25.719 --> 01:27.255
- YOU UNDERSTAND,
FATHER,

01:27.288 --> 01:29.623
WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKIN' INTO
EVERYBODY IN HER LIFE.

01:29.657 --> 01:31.225
- THAT'S WHY I CAME IN.

01:31.259 --> 01:33.527
YOU CAN'T BE
TOO CAREFUL THESE DAYS.

01:33.561 --> 01:35.463
AGIS QUOD AGIS.

01:35.496 --> 01:38.266
- AMEN, FATHER.

01:38.299 --> 01:39.567
CATHOLIC SCHOOL LATIN.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.835
IT'S BASICALLY,
"DON'T SCREW UP."

01:41.869 --> 01:42.870
- WHERE'S THE GIRL NOW?

01:42.903 --> 01:43.871
- GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES,

01:43.904 --> 01:46.374
I HAD HER TAKEN
TO THE CHILD ADVOCACY CENTER.

01:46.407 --> 01:48.142
- OKAY, I'LL HEAD OVER.

01:48.176 --> 01:51.479
- AMARO,
WHY DON'T YOU GO WITH HER?

01:51.512 --> 01:53.547
- CAPTAIN, SHE'S 13.

01:53.581 --> 01:55.283
SHE DOESN'T NEED
TWO DETECTIVES IN HER FACE,

01:55.316 --> 01:56.484
SHE'LL BE OVERWHELMED.

01:56.517 --> 01:59.287
- HIS SPANISH
IS SLIGHTLY BETTER THAN YOURS,

01:59.320 --> 02:03.691
AND THE GIRL LIVES WITH
HER PUERTO RICAN GRANDMOTHER.

02:05.793 --> 02:08.762
- DOCTOR SAID THE GIRL PRESENTED
WITHOUT ANY SIGNS OF ABUSE,

02:08.796 --> 02:11.432
HER HYMEN IS INTACT, THERE'S
NO SIGNS OF EXTERNAL TRAUMA.

02:11.465 --> 02:13.301
- AND SHE WON'T SAY
WHO THE FATHER IS.

02:13.334 --> 02:16.704
- POOR GIRL MUST BE
SCARED OUT OF HER MIND.

02:16.737 --> 02:20.641
- THERE'S ELLA. SHE'S CLINGING
TO HER GRANDMOTHER.

02:20.674 --> 02:23.377
- COULD BE WHY
ELLA WON'T OPEN UP.

02:23.411 --> 02:25.879
- WAIT,
JUST GIVE ME A MINUTE.

02:25.913 --> 02:30.584
ASIDE FROM THE SPANISH,
ABUELITAS LOVE ME.

02:34.655 --> 02:37.591
- HE'S YOUR NEW PARTNER?

02:37.625 --> 02:39.960
- UH, NO.

02:39.993 --> 02:43.197
I'M JUST SHOWIN' HIM
THE ROPES.

02:43.231 --> 02:46.434
[both speaking Spanish]

02:46.467 --> 02:48.836
IF SHE WAS HURT,
I WON'T FORGIVE MYSELF.

02:48.869 --> 02:51.605
- MRS. MENDEZ.
- OKAY.

02:51.639 --> 02:53.641
- IT'S JUST THE TWO OF YOU
IN THE APARTMENT?

02:53.674 --> 02:54.875
- YES.

02:54.908 --> 02:58.346
HER MOTHER,
SHE DIED WHEN ELLA WAS FIVE.

02:58.379 --> 03:00.548
[both speaking Spanish]

03:00.581 --> 03:04.318
- WELL,
YOU'VE HAD TO CARRY A LOT.

03:04.352 --> 03:08.322
- MY DAUGHTER WAS WILD.
ALWAYS IN TROUBLE.

03:08.356 --> 03:10.291
PREGNANT AT 15.

03:10.324 --> 03:14.595
I TOLD ELLA,
"DON'T BE LIKE YOUR MOTHER."

03:14.628 --> 03:18.399
SHE KNOWS
TO WAIT FOR THE RIGHT MAN,

03:18.432 --> 03:21.001
FOR HER PRINCE.

03:21.034 --> 03:23.337
- I DIDN'T HAVE SEX.

03:23.371 --> 03:24.972
- FIRST OF ALL,
YOU'RE NOT IN TROUBLE.

03:25.005 --> 03:27.575
BUT WE DO NEED TO FIND OUT
WHO DID THIS.

03:27.608 --> 03:29.277
- NOBODY DID ANYTHING.

03:29.310 --> 03:33.347
- WELL,
SOMEBODY GOT YOU PREGNANT.

03:33.381 --> 03:35.849
- DID THEY TELL YOU
NOT TO SAY ANYTHING?

03:35.883 --> 03:36.850
- NO.

03:36.884 --> 03:38.586
IT WASN'T LIKE THAT.

03:38.619 --> 03:44.592
- OKAY, SO WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME
WHAT IT WAS LIKE?

03:44.625 --> 03:49.563
ELLA, WHATEVER HAPPENED,
THIS WASN'T YOUR FAULT.

03:57.004 --> 04:00.341
- MY GRANDMOTHER TOLD ME
HOW BABIES ARE MADE,

04:00.374 --> 04:04.445
AND I KNOW
HOW I GOT THIS BABY.

04:04.478 --> 04:06.914
- OKAY,
SO YOU CAN TELL ME.

04:06.947 --> 04:08.449
- YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE ME.

04:08.482 --> 04:11.985
- ELLA, WHOEVER IT IS,
WHOEVER HURT YOU, I PROMISE YOU,

04:12.019 --> 04:15.689
THEY'RE NEVER GONNA BE ABLE
TO HURT YOU AGAIN.

04:15.723 --> 04:19.460
JUST TELL ME WHO IT WAS.

04:23.864 --> 04:26.300
- IT WAS GOD.

04:26.334 --> 04:28.502
I DIDN'T HAVE SEX.

04:28.536 --> 04:32.005
THIS BABY IS A MIRACLE.

04:32.039 --> 04:34.575
- [sighs]

05:22.923 --> 05:24.425
- ULTRASOUND CONFIRMS IT.

05:24.458 --> 05:26.794
ELLA MENDEZ IS AT LEAST
EIGHT WEEKS PREGNANT.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.629
- WHAT, WITH AN UNBROKEN HYMEN?
IS THAT EVEN--

05:28.662 --> 05:30.364
- IT'S NOT THAT UNUSUAL.

05:30.398 --> 05:32.766
- AND SHE STILL REFUSES
TO NAME THE FATHER?

05:32.800 --> 05:34.868
- SHE'S PROTECTING HIM
OR SHE'S SCARED.

05:34.902 --> 05:36.770
EITHER WAY,
IT'S SOMEBODY SHE KNOWS.

05:36.804 --> 05:38.772
- WHAT ABOUT THE SCHOOL.
ANY ALLEGATIONS?

05:38.806 --> 05:40.408
- GRANDMA SAID PLENTY,
A FEW YEARS AGO,

05:40.441 --> 05:42.643
BUT MONSIGNOR KIAGA CAME IN,
HE CLEANED HOUSE.

05:42.676 --> 05:43.711
HE'S ONE OF THE GOOD GUYS.

05:43.744 --> 05:45.379
- ALL RIGHT,
ALL DUE RESPECT, NICK,

05:45.413 --> 05:47.047
BUT I'M GONNA HAVE MUNCH
DOUBLE-CHECK THAT.

05:47.080 --> 05:48.616
- WHY DO I
ALWAYS GET THE PRIESTS?

05:48.649 --> 05:50.951
- SO WHO ARE
THE ADULT MALES IN HER LIFE?

05:50.984 --> 05:52.219
- WELL,
THE GRANDMOTHER DOESN'T DATE,

05:52.252 --> 05:54.988
AND SHE SWEARS THAT NO OTHER MEN
HAVE ACCESS TO THE APARTMENT.

05:55.022 --> 05:56.924
- RELATIVES?
- ELLA'S FATHER'S ESTRANGED,

05:56.957 --> 05:59.059
SO MINIMAL CONTACT.
- EVEN SO,

05:59.092 --> 06:01.662
FIN, ROLLINS,
GO TALK TO ELLA'S FATHER.

06:01.695 --> 06:04.765
BENSON, AMARO,
GO TO BLESSED SAVIOR.

06:04.798 --> 06:08.669
IF ELLA HAS A SECRET, MAYBE
SHE CONFESSED TO HER FRIENDS.

06:11.071 --> 06:12.606
- I SEND MY CHECK
EVERY MONTH,

06:12.640 --> 06:14.174
AND IF HER GRANDMOTHER
SAYS I DON'T, SHE'S LYING.

06:14.207 --> 06:16.477
- THAT'S NOT
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

06:16.510 --> 06:19.713
- THE GIRL'S
IN SOME KIND OF TROUBLE?

06:19.747 --> 06:21.549
- WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW "THE GIRL?"

06:21.582 --> 06:23.817
- FIVE MONTHS AGO?
I DON'T KNOW.

06:23.851 --> 06:26.119
- MR. MARAIS, DO YOU KNOW
IF ELLA HAS A BOYFRIEND?

06:26.153 --> 06:27.588
- I HAVE NO IDEA.

06:27.621 --> 06:29.857
WHAT'D SHE DO?
- YOUR DAUGHTER'S PREGNANT.

06:29.890 --> 06:32.893
- [laughs] WHAT DOES THAT
HAVE TO DO WITH ME?

06:32.926 --> 06:35.128
- WOW,
USUALLY WHEN A FATHER HEARS

06:35.162 --> 06:37.665
HIS 13-YEAR-OLD IS PREGNANT,
HE LOSES IT.

06:37.698 --> 06:40.033
- I BARELY KNOW HER, OKAY?

06:40.067 --> 06:42.002
ELLA'S GRANDMOTHER
NEVER FORGAVE ME

06:42.035 --> 06:43.504
FOR KNOCKIN' UP
HER DAUGHTER.

06:43.537 --> 06:45.172
- DON'T YOU
CARE ABOUT YOUR DAUGHTER?

06:45.205 --> 06:46.540
- HAVE YOU SEEN THE GIRL?

06:46.574 --> 06:50.077
I'M NOT EVEN SURE
SHE'S MINE.

06:50.110 --> 06:52.880
- 13-YEAR-OLDS TODAY.

06:52.913 --> 06:55.649
WE TRY
TO KEEP THEM INNOCENT,

06:55.683 --> 06:59.720
BUT WE'RE LOSING THEM TO
THE KARDASHIANS, AND LADY GAGA.

06:59.753 --> 07:02.122
- WELL, UH,
ELLA SEEMS PRETTY SHELTERED.

07:02.155 --> 07:04.925
- SHE WAS ONE OF THE GOOD GIRLS.
THAT'S WHY THIS IS SO SHOCKING.

07:04.958 --> 07:08.796
- YEAH, SHE'S STILL A GOOD GIRL,
SISTER.

07:08.829 --> 07:12.533
- WE'RE ALL CONCERNED,
BUT IF ANYTHING DID HAPPEN,

07:12.566 --> 07:14.468
IT WASN'T SOMEONE HERE
AT BLESSED SAVIOR.

07:14.502 --> 07:15.302
- YOU'RE SURE ABOUT THAT?

07:15.335 --> 07:18.238
- WE PAY
VERY CLOSE ATTENTION HERE.

07:18.271 --> 07:21.575
- CLOSE ENOUGH TO KNOW
HOW SHE GOT PREGNANT?

07:21.609 --> 07:27.481
- SISTER, DID YOU NOTICE ANY
CHANGES IN ELLA'S MOOD RECENTLY?

07:27.515 --> 07:29.517
- SHE SEEMED HAPPIER.

07:29.550 --> 07:31.051
YOU KNOW,
A FEW WEEKS AGO,

07:31.084 --> 07:34.788
I HEARD HER SINGING TO HERSELF
IN THE STAIRWELL.

07:34.822 --> 07:35.856
- ELLA?
[laughs]

07:35.889 --> 07:38.191
THE ONLY BOY SHE THINKS ABOUT
IS PRINCE WILLIAM.

07:38.225 --> 07:40.628
SHE TALKED ABOUT
THE ROYAL WEDDING ALL THE TIME.

07:40.661 --> 07:42.830
- SO ANY BOYS INTO HER?

07:42.863 --> 07:45.666
- ARTURO.
HE FOLLOWS HER LIKE A PUPPY.

07:45.699 --> 07:47.034
- ARTURO.

07:47.067 --> 07:48.536
- CAME IN THE MIDDLE
OF LAST YEAR,

07:48.569 --> 07:49.937
ALWAYS SITS NEXT TO HER,

07:49.970 --> 07:52.205
AND WHEN SHE PASSED OUT,
HE FREAKED.

07:52.239 --> 07:55.576
- SO HE LIKES HER,
BUT SHE'S NOT INTO HIM.

07:55.609 --> 07:57.778
- YEAH, LIKE THAT.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.980
ARTURO'S
ALWAYS PUFFIN' ON HIS INHALER.

08:00.013 --> 08:01.682
HE WASN'T GETTIN' WITH
NO GIRL.

08:01.715 --> 08:03.651
- AND WHICH ONE IS HE?

08:03.684 --> 08:05.819
- ARTURO?
HE AIN'T HERE RIGHT NOW.

08:05.853 --> 08:09.222
BOTH THEIR SEATS BEEN EMPTY
SINCE SHE GOT SICK.

08:09.256 --> 08:10.991
- THANKS, KID.

08:11.024 --> 08:13.293
- ONE NAME CAME UP,
AND IT SOUNDS LIKE A LONG SHOT--

08:13.326 --> 08:15.095
- ARTURO?

08:20.000 --> 08:21.769
- HE'S NOT TRUANT.

08:21.802 --> 08:24.572
I TOLD THE SCHOOL,
ARTURO WAS UP ALL NIGHT. ASTHMA.

08:24.605 --> 08:26.974
- SORRY.
SO MRS. RIVERA,

08:27.007 --> 08:29.643
WE JUST HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS
ABOUT ELLA MENDEZ.

08:29.677 --> 08:31.311
- IS ELLA OKAY?

08:31.344 --> 08:33.113
- YOU TWO FRIENDS, ARTURO?

08:33.146 --> 08:35.148
- IS ELLA IN TROUBLE?

08:35.182 --> 08:37.284
- [clears throat]
EXCUSE ME.

08:37.317 --> 08:40.588
I'M SORRY, UH, MAY I TROUBLE YOU
FOR A GLASS OF WATER?

08:40.621 --> 08:43.857
- OF COURSE.
- THANK YOU.

08:48.729 --> 08:51.965
- IS ELLA SICK?
SHE WASN'T AT SCHOOL TODAY.

08:51.999 --> 08:53.100
- WELL,
NEITHER WERE YOU.

08:53.133 --> 08:57.337
WHAT, YOU TEXTED ONE OF
YOUR FRIENDS TO CHECK UP ON HER?

08:57.370 --> 09:00.641
- ARE YOU GONNA TELL MY MOM?
SHE DOESN'T LIKE ME TEXTING.

09:00.674 --> 09:02.009
- [laughs] NO.

09:02.042 --> 09:06.980
NAH,
I DON'T NEED TO TELL YOUR MOM,

09:07.014 --> 09:12.085
BUT, UH, MAN TO MAN, ARTURO,
I NEED TO KNOW,

09:12.119 --> 09:14.822
IS ELLA YOUR GIRLFRIEND?

09:14.855 --> 09:16.189
- I'M HER BEST FRIEND.

09:16.223 --> 09:18.992
- ANY OTHER BOY
SHE HANGS OUT WITH?

09:19.026 --> 09:21.995
- JUST ME.

09:22.029 --> 09:25.833
- DOES SHE EVER
TALK ABOUT A TEACHER,

09:25.866 --> 09:28.135
MAYBE A FRIEND'S FATHER?

09:28.168 --> 09:31.071
- NO. NOTHING LIKE THAT.
- OH.

09:31.104 --> 09:34.875
IF THERE WAS,
YOU COULD TELL ME.

09:34.908 --> 09:37.344
- OKAY, [sighs]

09:37.377 --> 09:39.980
BUT I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.
[sighs]

09:40.013 --> 09:41.682
I SWEAR.
- OKAY.

09:41.715 --> 09:44.752
- I NEED TO GET MY INHALER.
[wheezing]

09:44.785 --> 09:46.253
- HERE. HERE YOU GO.

09:50.691 --> 09:51.892
THIS KID
MAY KNOW SOMETHING.

09:51.925 --> 09:54.695
HIS CHEST TIGHTENED UP
WHEN I STARTED TO PUSH.

09:54.728 --> 09:56.263
- WHOEVER GOT ELLA PREGNANT,

09:56.296 --> 09:57.765
BOTH THOSE KIDS
ARE SCARED OF HIM.

09:57.798 --> 09:59.967
- HUH. MUNCH JUST GOT A HIT
OFF THE DATABASE

10:00.000 --> 10:01.234
ON ONE OF HER TEACHERS.

10:01.268 --> 10:02.469
- LUIS CORDOVA,

10:02.502 --> 10:05.172
SCIENCE TEACHER FOR THE PAST
FIVE YEARS AT BLESSED SAVIOR.

10:05.205 --> 10:06.740
- THERE'S A COMPLAINT
AGAINST HIM?

10:06.774 --> 10:08.041
- NOT EXACTLY.

10:08.075 --> 10:10.043
- SO WHAT DID THIS GUY DO?

10:10.077 --> 10:11.945
- ROSE FROM THE DEAD.

10:11.979 --> 10:15.382
COME ON, KID.
WATCH AND LEARN.

10:15.415 --> 10:17.350
OUR CONDOLENCES,
MR. CORDOVA,

10:17.384 --> 10:20.287
ACCORDING TO CITY RECORDS,
YOU'VE BEEN DEAD FOR 15 YEARS.

10:20.320 --> 10:22.255
- [stammering]
OKAY, I CAN EXPLAIN.

10:22.289 --> 10:25.325
- WE'RE ALL EARS.
- LUIS CORDOVA IS MY UNCLE.

10:25.358 --> 10:26.794
- WHAT'S YOUR REAL NAME?

10:26.827 --> 10:28.962
- DIEGO RAMIREZ.
- DIEGO,

10:28.996 --> 10:31.965
EXPLAIN AWAY.
JUMPED BAIL?

10:31.999 --> 10:33.233
IS THERE A WARRANT OUT ON YOU?
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

10:33.266 --> 10:35.736
- NO.
NECESITO UN ABOGADO?

10:35.769 --> 10:39.106
- NOT IF YOU DIDN'T
DO ANYTHING WRONG.

10:39.139 --> 10:40.173
YOU'RE LEGAL, RIGHT?

10:40.207 --> 10:42.242
- YEAH.
- ALL RIGHT,

10:42.275 --> 10:43.376
SO I'M GOIN' TO GUESS

10:43.410 --> 10:48.115
DIEGO CAN'T GET A SCHOOL JOB
BECAUSE HE HAS A RECORD.

10:48.148 --> 10:51.418
- I SHOULDN'T HAVE ONE.
I SWEAR,

10:51.451 --> 10:55.288
BUT I'M ON
THE SEX OFFENDERS REGISTRY.

10:55.322 --> 10:57.958
- OH, THIS GETS
BETTER AND BETTER.

10:57.991 --> 10:59.359
FOR US, MR. DIEGO,
NOT FOR YOU.

10:59.392 --> 11:02.830
- HOW'D YOU MAKE THE LIST?

11:02.863 --> 11:08.301
- I WAS 19. I HAD SEX
WITH MY GIRL ON PROM NIGHT,

11:08.335 --> 11:11.304
TWO DAYS
BEFORE HER 17th BIRTHDAY.

11:11.338 --> 11:16.076
HER FATHER KNEW SOMEBODY.
HE PRESSED CHARGES.

11:16.109 --> 11:18.846
SEXUAL MISCONDUCT.

11:18.879 --> 11:20.347
THEY BANGED ME AROUND SO BAD
IN PRISON,

11:20.380 --> 11:23.851
I GOT NO SENSE OF BALANCE.
I STILL CAN'T EVEN DRIVE.

11:23.884 --> 11:26.954
FIVE YEARS I PAID LAWYERS
TO GET MY NAME REMOVED,

11:26.987 --> 11:30.090
I USED UP
ALL OF MY SAVINGS.

11:30.123 --> 11:31.759
I COULDN'T GET A JOB.

11:31.792 --> 11:37.064
- WELL, YOU JUST
LOST ANOTHER ONE, DIEGO.

11:42.002 --> 11:44.337
- YOU SEE ARTURO OR ELLA
BEIN' TERRIFIED OF THIS GUY?

11:44.371 --> 11:46.039
- LOOK, THAT'S THE THING
ABOUT PEDOPHILES,

11:46.073 --> 11:48.208
THEY KNOW HOW TO MAKE PEOPLE
TRUST THEM.

11:48.241 --> 11:49.309
- I DON'T LIKE HIM FOR THIS.

11:49.342 --> 11:51.979
THERE'S 100 WAYS ONTO THAT LIST,
THERE'S NO WAY OFF.

11:52.012 --> 11:54.381
- WELL,
HE'S A CONVICTED SEX OFFENDER

11:54.414 --> 11:57.484
WHO USED AN ASSUMED NAME
TO GET A JOB TEACHING MINORS,

11:57.517 --> 11:59.519
INCLUDING ELLA.
- GO TALK TO HER.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.955
HE'LL WAIT.

12:01.989 --> 12:04.357
- SO TELL ME
ABOUT YOUR TEACHER.

12:04.391 --> 12:08.328
- MR. CORDOVA LIKES
TALKING ABOUT GROSS STUFF.

12:08.361 --> 12:12.265
DUNG BEETLES, MAGGOTS,
SLUG SLIME.

12:12.299 --> 12:15.803
- YEAH?
ANYTHING ELSE ICKY ABOUT HIM?

12:15.836 --> 12:19.873
- I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE.

12:19.907 --> 12:23.043
- EVER BEEN ALONE WITH HIM?

12:23.076 --> 12:24.511
- YEAH.

12:24.544 --> 12:27.347
- WANT TO TELL ME
ABOUT IT?

12:31.151 --> 12:33.120
- HE'S THE ONE.

12:33.153 --> 12:34.888
HE HAD SEX WITH ME.

12:34.922 --> 12:38.325
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
BEFORE.

12:38.358 --> 12:39.960
I WAS SCARED.

12:39.993 --> 12:42.262
- OKAY. WHEN?

12:42.295 --> 12:46.333
- UM, A COUPLE MONTHS AGO,
AT HIS HOUSE.

12:48.601 --> 12:51.238
- HOW DID YOU GET THERE?

12:51.271 --> 12:55.843
IN HIS CAR?
- YES, AFTER SCHOOL.

12:55.876 --> 13:00.848
HE SAID I WAS SO PRETTY,
HE WANTED TO BE ALONE WITH ME.

13:03.583 --> 13:09.556
- YOU KNOW, ELLA,
MR. CORDOVA DOESN'T OWN A CAR.

13:09.589 --> 13:11.859
HE CAN'T DRIVE.

13:11.892 --> 13:16.163
- BUT--
- SO HE'S NOT THE ONE, IS HE?

13:18.031 --> 13:21.034
- WILL YOU TELL ME
WHO IT IS?

13:24.938 --> 13:26.439
DID HE SEND YOU THOSE?

13:26.473 --> 13:28.808
- I GOT THEM FOR MYSELF.

13:32.880 --> 13:35.983
- "TO ELLA,
STILL DREAMING OF YOU."

13:36.016 --> 13:37.951
NO NAME.

13:37.985 --> 13:42.289
WHO SENT YOU THE BOUQUET?

13:42.322 --> 13:47.260
ELLA,
WAS IT A BOY FROM SCHOOL?

13:47.294 --> 13:48.428
ARTURO, MAYBE?

13:48.461 --> 13:51.298
- WHAT? NO.

13:51.331 --> 13:56.069
THE MAN I'M GOING TO MARRY
IS RICH AND HANDSOME.

13:56.103 --> 13:58.906
I'M GONNA BE HIS PRINCESS.

14:01.441 --> 14:04.244
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

14:04.277 --> 14:08.415
ELLA WAS SENT ROSES
FROM A MADISON AVENUE FLORIST.

14:08.448 --> 14:11.952
A FLEUR DE TOIS.

14:11.985 --> 14:14.587
- WONDER WHAT UPPER EAST SIDE
PRINCE IS SENDING ROSES

14:14.621 --> 14:17.057
TO A 13-YEAR-OLD
IN WASHINGTON HEIGHTS.

14:19.059 --> 14:20.961
- I DON'T SEE
A RECORD OF THAT DELIVERY.

14:20.994 --> 14:22.662
- WELL, WHY DON'T YOU
CHECK AGAIN, WE'LL WAIT.

14:22.695 --> 14:24.264
- WE'RE
A HIGH-VOLUME BOUTIQUE.

14:24.297 --> 14:26.399
WE SEND
DOZENS OF BOUQUETS A DAY.

14:26.433 --> 14:28.035
- TO 187th STREET?

14:28.068 --> 14:29.269
- EVEN IF I COULD
FIND THE RECORD,

14:29.302 --> 14:32.005
I CAN'T REVEAL A CLIENT,
MY BOSS WOULD KILL ME.

14:32.039 --> 14:35.408
- LOOK, THERE'S NO
FLORIST/CLIENT PRIVILEGE, OKAY?

14:35.442 --> 14:38.278
AND THE FLOWERS WERE SENT
TO A 13-YEAR-OLD GIRL.

14:38.311 --> 14:39.212
- OH.

14:39.246 --> 14:42.282
DON'T YOU PEOPLE
USUALLY NEED A SUBPOENA?

14:42.315 --> 14:45.052
- OKAY.
HAVE IT YOUR WAY.

14:45.085 --> 14:47.554
BUT WE'LL ALSO CALL
THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE,

14:47.587 --> 14:50.257
AND THEY'LL BE COMBING THROUGH
YOUR BOSS' TAXES

14:50.290 --> 14:51.491
FOR A FEW MONTHS.

14:51.524 --> 14:54.995
- WAIT, LOOK,
LOOK, FRIEND,

14:55.028 --> 14:56.930
WE NEED TO DO OUR JOB,
RIGHT?

14:56.964 --> 15:00.433
AND YOU NEED TO PROTECT YOURS,
I GET THAT.

15:00.467 --> 15:01.501
YOU DON'T EVEN SAY THE NAME.

15:01.534 --> 15:04.571
ALL RIGHT, WE JUST
HAPPEN TO SEE IT ON YOUR SCREEN,

15:04.604 --> 15:08.041
AND I SWEAR,
THIS NEVER COMES BACK TO YOU.

15:11.044 --> 15:12.579
[single keyboard tap]

15:13.746 --> 15:16.483
THANK YOU.

15:16.516 --> 15:17.617
- VERY NICE.

15:17.650 --> 15:19.719
- [laughs]

15:19.752 --> 15:22.722
NO WONDER
HE DIDN'T WANT TO TALK.

15:22.755 --> 15:25.125
LET'S PAY PRINCE CHARMING
A VISIT.

15:25.158 --> 15:26.193
- EASY, DETECTIVE,

15:26.226 --> 15:29.362
I THINK WE NEED TO
LOOP THE CAPTAIN IN ON THIS ONE.

15:35.502 --> 15:39.372
- AMBASSADOR ANDREW RAINES
SENT ELLA MENDEZ ROSES?

15:39.406 --> 15:41.474
- EIGHT WEEKS AGO,
RIGHT AFTER SHE GOT PREGNANT.

15:41.508 --> 15:42.675
- BILLED TO HIS ACCOUNT.

15:42.709 --> 15:43.610
THE FLORIST
DIDN'T WANT TO GIVE HIM UP.

15:43.643 --> 15:46.379
- THE NEW YORK ROYAL FAMILY
STRIKES AGAIN.

15:46.413 --> 15:48.015
- OH, COME ON.

15:48.048 --> 15:50.717
HE'S ABOUT TO ANNOUNCE FOR
HIS FATHER'S OLD SENATE SEAT.

15:50.750 --> 15:53.053
DO WE REALLY THINK
HE'S HAVING SEX

15:53.086 --> 15:55.122
WITH A 13-YEAR-OLD
FROM WASHINGTON HEIGHTS?

15:55.155 --> 15:56.489
- YOU'RE RIGHT, CAPTAIN,
DOESN'T HAVE TO BE HIM.

15:56.523 --> 15:58.625
COULD'VE BEEN A BROTHER,
A COUSIN, A NEPHEW.

15:58.658 --> 16:00.060
- ALL RIGHT,
THAT'S ENOUGH.

16:00.093 --> 16:01.361
IF YOU HAVEN'T BEEN
PAYING ATTENTION,

16:01.394 --> 16:05.532
IT'S BEEN A BAD COUPLE OF MONTHS
FOR NYPD AND THE D.A.'s OFFICE.

16:05.565 --> 16:10.203
THIS IS A VERY SOPHISTICATED
FAMILY WITH UNLIMITED RESOURCES.

16:10.237 --> 16:13.506
SO BE THOROUGH,
BUT BE DISCREET.

16:15.642 --> 16:18.045
- NYPD,
I'M DETECTIVE OLIVIA BENSON.

16:18.078 --> 16:20.413
- IF THIS IS ABOUT TRIPP,
HE'S STILL IN SCHOOL.

16:20.447 --> 16:23.016
- TRIPP? UH, NO, ACTUALLY,
WE'RE HERE TO SEE THE AMBASS--

16:23.050 --> 16:24.417
- AMBASSADOR? HI.

16:24.451 --> 16:25.652
EXCUSE ME.
- UM--

16:25.685 --> 16:28.321
- AMBASSADOR.

16:28.355 --> 16:29.289
- HEY, HOW YOU DOIN'?

16:29.322 --> 16:32.192
DETECTIVE AMARO.
THIS IS DETECTIVE BENSON.

16:32.225 --> 16:34.127
- I'M SORRY,
I TRIED TO TELL THEM--

16:34.161 --> 16:37.264
- [speaks Spanish]

16:37.297 --> 16:38.631
- WHAT'S GOING ON,
SWEETHEART?

16:38.665 --> 16:42.035
- UH, WE NEED TO SPEAK
WITH YOUR HUSBAND.

16:42.069 --> 16:43.570
PROBABLY BE BEST
IN PRIVATE.

16:43.603 --> 16:45.772
- MY WIFE AND I
HAVE NO SECRETS.

16:45.805 --> 16:47.740
- OKAY, IN THAT CASE,
WE NEED TO KNOW

16:47.774 --> 16:50.443
WHY YOUR HUSBAND
SENT ROSES TO ELLA MENDEZ.

16:50.477 --> 16:51.811
- OH, PLEASE.

16:51.844 --> 16:54.147
WHAT, A FLORAL DELIVERY SCANDAL
ON THE DAY WE ANNOUNCE?

16:54.181 --> 16:55.215
[laughs]

16:55.248 --> 16:58.818
- ELLA MENDEZ
IS A 13-YEAR-OLD GIRL.

16:58.851 --> 17:00.820
SHE'S PREGNANT.

17:00.853 --> 17:04.457
- DO YOU, UH,
KNOW THIS GIRL?

17:04.491 --> 17:06.459
- DID SHE SAY
SHE KNOWS ME?

17:06.493 --> 17:09.229
I--
I MEET A LOT OF PEOPLE,

17:09.262 --> 17:13.533
AND THESE FLOWERS, DOZENS
OF STAFFERS ACCESS THAT ACCOUNT.

17:13.566 --> 17:16.136
ANY ONE OF THEM COULD HAVE SENT
THEM, FOR ANY NUMBER OF REASONS.

17:16.169 --> 17:18.305
- THE MAID HAS YOUR CARD?

17:18.338 --> 17:20.273
SO IF WE HEAR ANYTHING,
WE'LL CALL YOU.

17:20.307 --> 17:21.808
- THANK YOU.

17:27.114 --> 17:29.416
- THAT WENT WELL.
- YOU KNOW, THE HOUSEKEEPER

17:29.449 --> 17:34.421
ASSUMED THAT WE WERE THERE
ABOUT TRIPP, THEIR SON.

17:34.454 --> 17:37.290
MAYBE WE ARE.

17:39.526 --> 17:41.294
- I THOUGHT NEW YORK KIDS
DIDN'T DRIVE.

17:41.328 --> 17:43.430
- THEY DON'T DRIVE,
THEY'RE DRIVEN.

17:43.463 --> 17:44.764
- [laughing] OH.

17:44.797 --> 17:46.166
- YO, YOU GUYS
MISSED A SICK RAGER.

17:46.199 --> 17:47.467
THE GIRLS THERE
WERE SO HOT.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.269
- WELL THERE HE IS.
- OH, HEY MAN, WHAT'S UP?

17:49.302 --> 17:50.503
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL GIVE YOU A CALL.

17:50.537 --> 17:52.639
- HEY, TRIPP RAINES!

17:52.672 --> 17:55.475
WE NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

17:55.508 --> 17:57.677
- GO WAIT BY THE CAR,
I'LL BE THERE SOON.

17:57.710 --> 17:58.745
SO WHAT'S UP?

17:58.778 --> 17:59.779
- WANT TO ASK YOU
SOME QUESTIONS

17:59.812 --> 18:02.415
ABOUT YOUR LITTLE CHUCHITA,
ELLA MENDEZ.

18:02.449 --> 18:03.683
YOU REMEMBER HER, RIGHT?

18:03.716 --> 18:06.286
- I KNOW
SHE'LL NEVER FORGET ME.

18:06.319 --> 18:08.388
- [laughs]
YEAH?

18:08.421 --> 18:09.822
MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE A MAN
WHEN YOU POPPED HER?

18:09.856 --> 18:11.758
- I THREW HER SOME CHARITY,
OKAY?

18:11.791 --> 18:13.226
- EXCUSE ME,
DETECTIVES.

18:13.260 --> 18:15.195
I HAVE TO
TAKE MR. RAINES HOME.

18:15.228 --> 18:16.263
- I REMEMBER YOU.

18:16.296 --> 18:17.864
YOU USED TO WORK MAJOR CASE.

18:17.897 --> 18:19.299
BRIGGS, RIGHT?

18:19.332 --> 18:20.700
- HE'S NOT IN CUSTODY?

18:20.733 --> 18:21.701
- NO.

18:21.734 --> 18:25.605
- YOU'RE DONE NOW.

18:25.638 --> 18:29.376
- LITTLE PUNK
THINKS HE CAN'T BE TOUCHED.

18:29.409 --> 18:32.379
- I WONDER WHY.

18:32.412 --> 18:33.880
- YEAH,
WE'RE AT THE APARTMENT.

18:33.913 --> 18:36.516
ALL RIGHT,
CHECK BACK LATER.

18:36.549 --> 18:38.451
TRIPP'S HER PRINCE.

18:38.485 --> 18:42.355
- HE'S THE SAME AGE AS ELLA?
THERE GOES STATUTORY.

18:42.389 --> 18:47.594
- HE'S A SOPHISTICATED PLAYER,
SHE'S A PREGNANT LITTLE GIRL.

18:47.627 --> 18:49.162
GETTING INTO A TOWN CAR?

18:49.196 --> 18:50.597
- WHERE ARE THEY GOIN'?

18:50.630 --> 18:51.831
[distant arguing]

18:51.864 --> 18:54.167
- SHE DOESN'T
LOOK TOO HAPPY ABOUT IT.

18:54.201 --> 18:56.203
- ELLA, POR FAVOR--

18:56.236 --> 18:57.370
- ELLA!

18:57.404 --> 18:59.672
- [speaks Spanish]

18:59.706 --> 19:01.241
- ELLA.
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

19:01.274 --> 19:02.041
LET GO OF HER.
- I DON'T WANT TO.

19:02.074 --> 19:03.743
- ARE YOU OKAY?
- PLEASE HELP ME.

19:03.776 --> 19:04.844
- WHAT'S THE MATTER? LET GO.
WHAT'S THE MATTER, SWEETHEART?

19:04.877 --> 19:06.479
- I DON'T WANT TO GO.
- GO WHERE?

19:06.513 --> 19:09.649
I WANT TO KEEP MY BABY.

19:09.682 --> 19:14.287
[cries]

19:14.321 --> 19:16.589
- OH, MY GOD.

19:18.491 --> 19:23.563
- SO ELLA, WHOSE IDEA WAS IT
FOR YOU TO GET AN ABORTION?

19:23.596 --> 19:24.964
- HE SAID
IF I GOT THE ABORTION,

19:24.997 --> 19:27.300
WE COULD BE
BOYFRIEND-GIRLFRIEND.

19:27.334 --> 19:30.770
- NOW IS TRIPP THE ONLY BOY
THAT YOU'VE HAD SEX WITH?

19:30.803 --> 19:33.573
- YES. ONCE.

19:33.606 --> 19:34.574
- WHEN?

19:34.607 --> 19:38.311
- FOURTH OF JULY.

19:38.345 --> 19:40.447
I WENT TO A PARTY
AT HIS HOUSE.

19:40.480 --> 19:43.516
ARTURO WAS INVITED,
HE SAID I SHOULD COME TOO.

19:43.550 --> 19:46.486
- ARTURO?
HOW DOES HE KNOW TRIPP?

19:46.519 --> 19:50.323
- HIS MOM WORKED
AS THEIR MAID.

19:50.357 --> 19:52.592
- OKAY,
SO YOU WENT TO THE PARTY.

19:52.625 --> 19:53.993
THEN WHAT HAPPENED?

19:54.026 --> 19:57.830
- I'D NEVER BEEN IN A HOUSE
THAT BIG.

19:57.864 --> 20:01.901
TRIPP CAME OVER TO ARTURO AND ME
TO SAY HELLO.

20:01.934 --> 20:03.770
HE WAS SO NICE.

20:03.803 --> 20:05.938
- NICE HOW?

20:05.972 --> 20:09.409
- EVERYONE WAS DRINKING
JUNGLE JUICE.

20:09.442 --> 20:10.743
I TOLD HIM
I DON'T DRINK.

20:10.777 --> 20:14.314
[through telecom]
HE GOT ME LEMONADE.

20:14.347 --> 20:16.849
HE SHOWED ME
HIS PARENTS' ROOM.

20:16.883 --> 20:19.452
TWO BATHROOMS.

20:19.486 --> 20:22.955
IT WAS LIKE A PALACE.

20:22.989 --> 20:24.591
THEN HE SHOWED ME HIS ROOM.

20:24.624 --> 20:28.361
- THE TWO OF YOU WERE ALONE?
- YES.

20:28.395 --> 20:30.897
HE HAD A KING SIZE BED.

20:30.930 --> 20:34.267
HE BROUGHT ME
MORE LEMONADE.

20:34.301 --> 20:37.270
I WAS DIZZY, SO HE SAID
I SHOULD REST ON THE BED.

20:37.304 --> 20:39.739
- OKAY,
AND THEN WHAT?

20:39.772 --> 20:43.443
- IT'S KIND OF FUZZY.

20:43.476 --> 20:45.512
HE WAS KISSING ME.

20:45.545 --> 20:47.980
HE PUT HIS HAND
DOWN MY SHIRT.

20:48.014 --> 20:50.016
- AND WHAT DID YOU DO?

20:50.049 --> 20:51.984
- I TOLD HIM WE SHOULDN'T,

20:52.018 --> 20:54.587
THAT MY GRANDMOTHER
WOULD BE MAD.

20:54.621 --> 20:56.789
- AND WHAT DID HE SAY?

20:56.823 --> 20:59.826
- HE SAID,
"DON'T TELL HER."

20:59.859 --> 21:03.963
HE SAID I WAS HOT,
THAT HE LIKED ME.

21:08.568 --> 21:11.871
- OKAY, ELLA,
WHAT HAPPENED NEXT?

21:11.904 --> 21:16.376
- HE PUSHED ME DOWN
ON THE BED.

21:16.409 --> 21:19.579
HE PULLED DOWN MY SKIRT.

21:19.612 --> 21:22.582
AND HE PUT IT INSIDE.

21:22.615 --> 21:24.617
- ELLA,
DID YOU WANT HIM TO DO THAT?

21:24.651 --> 21:27.987
- NO. IT HURT.

21:28.020 --> 21:30.390
- DID YOU SAY NO?

21:30.423 --> 21:32.359
- YES. [sniffs]

21:32.392 --> 21:37.530
I REMEMBER I WAS CRYING,
'CAUSE THAT'S WHEN HE GOT MAD.

21:37.564 --> 21:41.334
HE SAID IT WAS MY FAULT,
THAT HE COULDN'T STOP.

21:41.368 --> 21:45.004
[sniffles]

21:45.037 --> 21:49.909
HE ASKED ME
IF I WANTED HIM TO LIKE ME.

21:49.942 --> 21:54.614
- DO YOU REMEMBER
WHAT HAPPENED NEXT?

21:54.647 --> 21:57.917
- WHEN HE WAS DONE, HE SAID
THAT I SHOULD CLEAN MYSELF UP.

21:57.950 --> 22:02.789
I TRIED TO FIND ARTURO,
BUT HE WAS GONE.

22:02.822 --> 22:05.725
I TOOK THE BUS HOME.

22:05.758 --> 22:09.462
[sniffs]

22:09.496 --> 22:14.033
- AND THEN THE NEXT DAY
TRIPP SENT YOU ROSES.

22:14.066 --> 22:17.570
- HE WOULDN'T DO THAT
FOR JUST ANYONE.

22:17.604 --> 22:19.906
RIGHT?

22:31.818 --> 22:35.655
- OKAY, COUNSELOR,
THERE'S NOT MUCH DOUBT THERE.

22:37.424 --> 22:39.726
- I DON'T KNOW.

22:39.759 --> 22:41.461
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU DON'T KNOW?

22:41.494 --> 22:42.595
SHE'S DESCRIBING A RAPE.

22:42.629 --> 22:43.996
- A JURY WON'T THINK SO.

22:44.030 --> 22:46.833
SEXUAL MISCONDUCT,
IF WE'RE LUCKY,

22:46.866 --> 22:49.736
AND WITH HIS LEGAL TEAM,
CONSENSUAL.

22:49.769 --> 22:51.904
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
SHE'S 13.

22:51.938 --> 22:53.573
- SO IS HE, SO TECHNICALLY,
THAT MEANS--

22:53.606 --> 22:55.408
- THAT HE GOT HER DRUNK.

22:55.442 --> 22:57.577
THE LEMONADE WAS SPIKED.

22:57.610 --> 23:00.079
SHE WAS A VIRGIN,
SHE SAID THAT IT HURT.

23:00.112 --> 23:02.181
SHE WAS CRYING,
SHE SAID NO.

23:02.214 --> 23:04.917
THERE WAS NO OUTCRY AFTERWARD.
HE SENT HER FLOWERS.

23:04.951 --> 23:06.486
EVEN ELLA TOLD YOU
THAT SHE THOUGHT

23:06.519 --> 23:07.887
THEY WERE GONNA GET MARRIED.

23:07.920 --> 23:09.789
- THAT'S HIS GAME.
I MEAN, HE KNOWS

23:09.822 --> 23:11.491
HOW TO TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF GIRLS LIKE THIS.

23:11.524 --> 23:14.494
- DO YOU HAVE ANY WAY
OF BACKING THAT UP?

23:14.527 --> 23:16.496
ELLA HAS CHANGED HER STORY
THREE TIMES.

23:16.529 --> 23:18.130
WE CAN'T EVEN PROVE
THAT SHE'S CARRYING HIS BABY.

23:18.164 --> 23:19.031
I MEAN,
UNLESS YOU WANT

23:19.065 --> 23:21.100
MY OFFICE TO COMPEL
A FETAL DNA TEST.

23:21.133 --> 23:23.570
NO, NO, NO. IT TOOK
A LONG TIME TO EARN HER TRUST.

23:23.603 --> 23:27.474
- I'M SURE IT DID.

23:27.507 --> 23:32.111
- WHAT THE HELL'S
THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

23:32.144 --> 23:36.783
COUNSELOR?
WHAT THE HELL DOES THAT MEAN?

23:36.816 --> 23:42.622
- UH, I'LL GO JUMP ON THE,
UH, C.A.C. PAPERWORK.

23:42.655 --> 23:46.459
BE BACK IN A FEW.

23:46.493 --> 23:47.694
- LOOK, OLIVIA, OKAY,
I UNDERSTAND

23:47.727 --> 23:48.861
YOU'VE BEEN
GOING THROUGH A LOT.

23:48.895 --> 23:51.731
- OH, NO.
DON'T YOU DARE PATRONIZE ME.

23:51.764 --> 23:54.801
YOU'RE OFF.

23:54.834 --> 23:57.169
WHAT I SAW, YOUR ANGER
PUSHED HER DISCLOSURE.

23:57.203 --> 24:00.206
- I'M OFF?
YOU KNOW WHAT I SEE?

24:00.239 --> 24:03.876
IS AN A.D.A. WHO'S TOO AFRAID
TO FOLLOW THE FACTS

24:03.910 --> 24:05.745
BECAUSE THE FAMILY
HAS TOO MUCH MUSCLE.

24:05.778 --> 24:08.981
YOU AND YOUR OFFICE
HAVE LOST YOUR NERVE.

24:12.785 --> 24:14.186
COME ON.

24:14.220 --> 24:17.490
[kicks machine]
[grunts]

24:17.524 --> 24:20.627
- HEY.

24:20.660 --> 24:22.862
- WHAT'S WRONG
WITH THESE PEOPLE?

24:22.895 --> 24:25.798
HOW COULD THEY NOT SEE?

24:25.832 --> 24:27.767
SHE'S NOT
GONNA PRESS CHARGES.

24:27.800 --> 24:29.035
- WAIT, WAIT.

24:29.068 --> 24:31.938
TELL YOU WHAT.

24:31.971 --> 24:34.907
LET'S PAY THE RAINES A VISIT
BEFORE THEY FIND THAT OUT.

24:34.941 --> 24:38.210
TRY AND GET TRIPP TO TELL US
HIS SIDE OF THE STORY.

24:42.048 --> 24:44.717
- IF SHE SAID THAT
HE FORCED HER, SHE'S A LIAR.

24:44.751 --> 24:47.286
I MEAN, GIRLS THROW THEMSELVES
AT MY SON ALL THE TIME.

24:47.319 --> 24:50.089
- SO WHEN THEY WIND UP PREGNANT,
YOU PAY FOR THE ABORTIONS?

24:50.122 --> 24:52.825
- THAT'S ANOTHER LIE.
SHE'S MAKING ALL THIS UP.

24:52.859 --> 24:54.794
- MAYBE, BUT UNLESS
WE TALK TO TRIPP,

24:54.827 --> 24:56.262
HER ACCUSATION'S
THE ONLY VERSION WE HAVE.

24:56.295 --> 24:59.532
- I TOLD YOU,
TALK TO MY LAWYER.

24:59.566 --> 25:03.135
- LOOK, AMBASSADOR,
YOU TRUST YOUR SON?

25:03.169 --> 25:04.671
- MM-HMM.

25:04.704 --> 25:06.773
- LET US TALK TO HIM
BEFORE THE D.A. DIGS IN.

25:06.806 --> 25:10.743
- I THINK YOU SHOULD LEAVE.
- KATHLEEN, PLEASE.

25:10.777 --> 25:13.045
- YOU GOT FIVE MINUTES,
WITH US IN THE ROOM.

25:13.079 --> 25:14.814
- OKAY.
- AND IT'S OFF THE RECORD.

25:14.847 --> 25:16.816
- DEAL.

25:18.084 --> 25:22.188
- TRIPP!
TRIPP? TRIPP?

25:22.221 --> 25:23.923
- [laughs]

25:23.956 --> 25:28.795
MY HUSBAND'S A POLITICIAN.
HE WANTS EVERYONE TO LIKE HIM.

25:28.828 --> 25:30.797
I DON'T.

25:30.830 --> 25:32.999
IF YOU PEOPLE THINK YOU'RE GONNA
TAKE THIS GIRL'S FICTION,

25:33.032 --> 25:35.234
AND HURT MY SON,

25:35.267 --> 25:38.104
YOU'RE GONNA GO DOWN HARD.

25:38.137 --> 25:40.907
- UH, TRIPP'S OUT.

25:40.940 --> 25:42.008
HE'S STUDYING
WITH HIS FRIENDS.

25:42.041 --> 25:44.343
- HE SHOULD BE
UP IN HIS ROOM.

25:44.376 --> 25:48.748
- I'LL CALL THE D.A.'s OFFICE
IN THE MORNING.

25:48.781 --> 25:50.049
HMM?
- MMM.

25:50.082 --> 25:52.852
- HAVE A NICE EVENING.

26:00.259 --> 26:02.028
- SHE SEEMS PRETTY WORRIED
ABOUT TRIPP.

26:02.061 --> 26:03.129
- AND HE IS TOO.

26:03.162 --> 26:06.999
HE WAS JUST COVERING.
KID'S NOT IN A STUDY GROUP.

26:07.033 --> 26:10.036
HE'S ON THE RUN.

26:13.773 --> 26:14.974
- NO SIGN OF TRIPP RAINES.

26:15.007 --> 26:17.944
UNMARKED CAR SAT IN FRONT OF
HIS TOWNHOUSE ALL LAST NIGHT.

26:17.977 --> 26:18.945
HE NEVER CAME HOME.

26:18.978 --> 26:21.380
- BUT THE FAMILY
HASN'T REPORTED HIM MISSING.

26:21.413 --> 26:22.749
WHAT ABOUT
THE OTHER RESIDENCES?

26:22.782 --> 26:23.916
- WELL,
THERE'S BEEN POLICE PRESENCE

26:23.950 --> 26:26.152
AT THEIR HOMES IN ASPEN,
MARTHA'S VINEYARD, EAST HAMPTON,

26:26.185 --> 26:27.720
SO FAR HE HASN'T SHOWED.

26:27.754 --> 26:31.290
- I JUST GOT A CALL
FROM THE RAINES' FAMILY LAWYER.

26:31.323 --> 26:33.926
HE'S WORRIED
I'M ABOUT TO INDICT TRIPP.

26:33.960 --> 26:36.696
- AND THAT LEVERAGE UPSETS YOU,
COUNSELOR?

26:36.729 --> 26:38.798
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, HOLD ON.
BACK UP.

26:38.831 --> 26:41.100
DOES THIS MEAN
HIS FOLKS KNOW WHERE TRIPP IS?

26:41.133 --> 26:42.334
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

26:42.368 --> 26:44.904
- KID'S BEEN AWOL
SINCE YESTERDAY.

26:44.937 --> 26:47.139
- THE LAWYER DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT TRIPP BEING GONE.

26:47.173 --> 26:49.809
- BECAUSE THE FAMILY'S
TRYING TO BUY TIME.

26:49.842 --> 26:53.145
- DETECTIVES,
SOMEONE TO SEE YOU.

26:56.415 --> 26:59.318
- THANK YOU FOR COMING IN,
MRS. RAINES.

26:59.351 --> 27:01.721
- SOMETHING'S HAPPENED
TO MY SON.

27:01.754 --> 27:03.790
I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE IS,

27:03.823 --> 27:06.225
AND NEITHER DOES
OUR ALLEGED SECURITY.

27:06.258 --> 27:08.260
- IS IT POSSIBLE
THAT YOUR HUSBAND DOES?

27:08.294 --> 27:12.231
- NO. ANDREW AND I
DON'T HAVE ANY SECRETS.

27:12.264 --> 27:15.201
- THIS SITUATION
WITH THE GIRL IS--

27:17.770 --> 27:22.842
I KNOW THAT YOU THINK
THAT TRIPP IS TO BLAME.

27:22.875 --> 27:26.746
IT'S REALLY HARD ON HIM,
GROWING UP IN THE SPOTLIGHT,

27:26.779 --> 27:28.915
BUT HE'S NOT A BAD KID.

27:28.948 --> 27:31.417
- WHEN IS THE LAST TIME
ANYONE HEARD FROM YOUR SON?

27:31.450 --> 27:33.385
- AFTER SCHOOL.

27:33.419 --> 27:38.725
UM, BRIGGS BROUGHT HIM
TO HIS 4:00 FENCING LESSON,

27:38.758 --> 27:43.896
AND HE TOLD BRIGGS
THAT HE WAS GONNA WALK BACK.

27:43.930 --> 27:46.999
HE'S 13.

27:47.033 --> 27:50.737
HE'S OUT THERE ALL ALONE.

27:50.770 --> 27:53.239
- WE'RE GONNA FIND YOUR SON,
MRS. RAINES.

27:56.876 --> 27:58.811
- ALL RIGHT, LOOK, TRIPP'S
CELL RECORDS FROM YESTERDAY.

27:58.845 --> 28:00.012
LOOKIE HERE,

28:00.046 --> 28:05.017
3:45, AN OUTGOING CALL TO
WASHINGTON HEIGHTS, INEZ RIVERA.

28:05.051 --> 28:07.219
- ARTURO'S MOTHER.
- MM-HMM.

28:07.253 --> 28:09.355
LIV SAID
SHE WORKED FOR THE RAINES'.

28:09.388 --> 28:10.289
- WELL,
IF TRIPP'S ON THE RUN,

28:10.322 --> 28:12.424
THE HEIGHTS WOULD BE
A GOOD PLACE TO GO.

28:12.458 --> 28:14.226
I'LL CALL LIV.
- I'LL CALL.

28:14.260 --> 28:17.263
I'M SERGEANT.

28:17.296 --> 28:18.264
- SO WHERE IS HE?
- I TOLD YOU,

28:18.297 --> 28:20.199
I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE IS.

28:20.232 --> 28:23.836
- AND THE LAST TIME
YOU SPOKE TO TRIPP?

28:23.870 --> 28:25.504
- WEEK AGO?
- YEAH, TRY YESTERDAY,

28:25.537 --> 28:29.842
FOR 15 MINUTES. WE HAVE
HIS CELL PHONE RECORDS, SON.

28:29.876 --> 28:33.946
WHY DID TRIPP CALL YOU,
ARTURO?

28:35.414 --> 28:39.451
- LOOK, WE THINK HE WAS
IN A JAM, BECAUSE OF ELLA.

28:39.485 --> 28:44.223
DID HE ASK YOU FOR HELP?

28:44.256 --> 28:46.292
- HE JUST SAID
HE WANTED TO COME VISIT.

28:46.325 --> 28:49.195
I WAITED FOR HIM,
BUT HE NEVER SHOWED.

28:49.228 --> 28:50.262
- BACK UP.

28:50.296 --> 28:52.398
HOW DO YOU KNOW HIM?

28:52.431 --> 28:56.135
I MEAN, YOUR MOM TOOK YOU THERE
WHEN SHE WAS WORKIN'?

28:56.168 --> 28:58.805
IS THAT--
- NO, I LIVED IN THAT HOUSE,

28:58.838 --> 29:01.740
MY WHOLE LIFE.
NOW I'M HERE.

29:03.575 --> 29:06.813
- OH.
[laughs]

29:06.846 --> 29:09.115
OH, NOW I GET IT.

29:09.148 --> 29:10.950
- WHAT?
- WHY HE CALLED.

29:10.983 --> 29:14.253
WHY YOU COVER FOR HIM.

29:14.286 --> 29:17.957
LOOK, YOU BROUGHT ELLA
TO A PARTY AT HIS HOUSE,

29:17.990 --> 29:19.291
BUT YOU DIDN'T TELL US
ABOUT THAT.

29:19.325 --> 29:21.127
- NO--
- ARE YOU STILL LYIN' FOR HIM,

29:21.160 --> 29:22.261
ARTURO?
- NO.

29:22.294 --> 29:24.030
- WHAT, SO YOU CAN STAY FRIENDS
WITH HIM, IS THAT IT?

29:24.063 --> 29:25.965
- NO, IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.
- THEN WHAT IS IT?

29:25.998 --> 29:28.300
- I'M DONE HELPING HIM,
HE'S A JERK.

29:28.334 --> 29:32.204
I'M GLAD HE RAN AWAY.

29:32.238 --> 29:34.006
- MISS KATHLEEN
MUST BE WORRIED SICK.

29:34.040 --> 29:35.541
- IT SOUNDS LIKE
YOU TWO WERE CLOSE.

29:35.574 --> 29:37.844
HOW LONG DID YOU WORK
WITH THE RAINES FAMILY?

29:37.877 --> 29:39.011
- 15 YEARS.

29:39.045 --> 29:41.147
WONDERFUL WOMAN.

29:41.180 --> 29:44.283
SHE GAVE US CLOTHES,
TRIPP'S OLD LAPTOP.

29:44.316 --> 29:47.153
- ARE THE TWO BOYS CLOSE?
- SI, VERY.

29:47.186 --> 29:50.222
HE AND MY SON WERE BORN A MONTH
APART, THEY GREW UP TOGETHER.

29:50.256 --> 29:52.091
I REALLY WISH
I COULD HELP YOU,

29:52.124 --> 29:54.560
BUT I JUST
DON'T KNOW WHERE HE IS.

29:54.593 --> 29:55.962
- CAN YOU THINK OF
SOME PLACE

29:55.995 --> 30:01.033
THAT HE MIGHT GO
IF HE WAS UPSET OR SCARED?

30:01.067 --> 30:03.836
- HE AND MY SON USED TO PLAY
COWBOYS AND INDIANS IN THE PARK.

30:03.870 --> 30:07.039
I COULD NEVER GET THEM HOME
FOR THEIR BATHS.

30:07.073 --> 30:10.442
LITTLE BOYS, LITTLE PROBLEMS.
BIG BOYS--

30:10.476 --> 30:13.880
[cell phone rings]

30:13.913 --> 30:16.215
- BENSON.

30:16.248 --> 30:18.217
FROM THREE RETAIL STORES
ON BLEECKER.

30:18.250 --> 30:20.152
FOR THE LAST HOUR
HE'S HAD AN OPEN TAB

30:20.186 --> 30:22.922
AT PISTOLS AND PETTICOATS
ON CHRISTOPHER STREET.

30:22.955 --> 30:24.023
WE'RE ON OUR WAY.

30:24.056 --> 30:25.324
- CHRISTOPHER STREET?

30:25.357 --> 30:28.427
- YEAH, LET'S GO BREAK UP
A COMIN' OUT PARTY.

30:28.460 --> 30:30.162
- WE'RE LOOKIN'
FOR TRIPP RAINES.

30:30.196 --> 30:32.865
- OH, LITTLE SWEETIE IN
THE GREY? HE'S GOT THE OPEN TAB.

30:32.899 --> 30:34.633
CELEBRATIN' TWO OF HIS BUDDIES
JUST GOT MARRIED.

30:34.666 --> 30:39.538
- LEGALIZATION.
IT'S ABOUT TIME.

30:39.571 --> 30:42.274
TRIPP RAINES.

30:42.308 --> 30:43.509
TRIPP RAINES!

30:43.542 --> 30:45.377
- YO, TRIPP.
- WHAT?

30:45.411 --> 30:47.579
- COME WITH US.
- OH, COME ON.

30:47.613 --> 30:48.580
WHAT'D I DO?

30:48.614 --> 30:50.416
- USUALLY,
PEOPLE TURN AROUND

30:50.449 --> 30:51.617
THE FIRST TIME
THEIR NAMES ARE CALLED.

30:51.650 --> 30:54.353
LET'S GO. LET'S GO!
- OKAY!

30:55.988 --> 30:58.090
- YOU KNOW THIS KID?

30:58.124 --> 30:59.391
NEVER SEEN HIM BEFORE.

30:59.425 --> 31:01.627
- MAYBE YOU SAW HIS BODY.

31:01.660 --> 31:03.595
- I SWEAR
ON THOSE HAZELNUT EYES OF YOURS.

31:03.629 --> 31:05.564
I FOUND THE STUFF
IN CENTRAL PARK.

31:05.597 --> 31:07.399
- WHERE IN CENTRAL PARK?

31:07.433 --> 31:09.601
- THE RAMBLE,
UNDER A BRIDGE.

31:09.635 --> 31:12.004
- AND WHAT WERE YOU
DOIN' THERE?

31:12.038 --> 31:13.205
- GIVING A TUG AND CHUG

31:13.239 --> 31:17.243
TO SOME MIDDLE-AGED BREEDER
IN A GRATEFUL DEAD T-SHIRT.

31:17.276 --> 31:19.611
- SO NO ONE
CAN VERIFY YOUR STORY.

31:19.645 --> 31:21.613
- IT'S NOT LIKE HE
PAID WITH A CHECK, HONEY.

31:21.647 --> 31:23.082
- HONEY?
I'M TELLIN' YOU.

31:23.115 --> 31:26.352
- SORRY, I GET NERVOUS,
I GET NASTY.

31:28.487 --> 31:30.189
- YOU GOT A REASON
TO BE NERVOUS, JACE?

31:30.222 --> 31:32.925
- I DIDN'T KILL ANYBODY,
I MEAN, WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

31:32.959 --> 31:34.426
LOST CARDS ARE INSURED,
RIGHT?

31:34.460 --> 31:36.462
- COME ON. YOU GONNA
SHOW US WHERE THAT BRIDGE IS.

31:36.495 --> 31:38.030
COME ON, GET UP.

31:38.064 --> 31:41.033
- [sighs] HE'S GOT
PLENTY OF WAYS OF MAKIN' MONEY

31:41.067 --> 31:42.568
WITHOUT HAVING TO
ROLL A KID.

31:42.601 --> 31:45.637
- IF HE KNEW HOW HOT THAT CARD
WAS, HE WOULDN'T OPEN A BAR TAB.

31:45.671 --> 31:47.606
- OKAY,
SAY HE IS AN OPPORTUNIST.

31:47.639 --> 31:49.976
THAT MEANS ANYONE COULD HAVE
GOTTEN TO TRIPP FIRST.

31:50.009 --> 31:51.443
- IN THE RAMBLE?
THAT PLACE IS A LABYRINTH.

31:51.477 --> 31:53.179
YOU NEED AN ARMY TO GO IN THERE
AND FIND HIM.

31:53.212 --> 31:54.646
- THEN GET ONE.

31:54.680 --> 31:57.549
HAVE THE CENTRAL PARK SERGEANT
CALL A LEVEL ONE MOBILIZATION.

31:57.583 --> 32:01.153
I WANT AVIATION, K-9,
DIVERS IN THE LAKE.

32:01.187 --> 32:06.425
[helicopter buzz]
[police radio chatter]

32:16.235 --> 32:17.203
- DETECTIVES!

32:17.236 --> 32:18.637
OVER HERE.

32:37.689 --> 32:39.458
- MORE HEARTBREAK FOR THE
TRAGEDY-RIDDEN RAINES FAMILY,

32:39.491 --> 32:41.994
AS POLICE RECOVER THE BODY
OF 13-YEAR-OLD TRIPP RAINES--

32:42.028 --> 32:43.129
- THERE IS NO SUSPECT
AT THIS TIME

32:43.162 --> 32:44.463
IN THE BRUTAL MURDER
OF TRIPP RAINES--

32:44.496 --> 32:45.731
- THE BODY WAS FOUND
IN THE GAY CRUISING SECTION

32:45.764 --> 32:46.532
OF CENTRAL PARK.

32:46.565 --> 32:48.200
[overlapping
tv reporter chatter]

32:48.234 --> 32:49.201
- OVER HERE!
- MR. RAINES!

32:49.235 --> 32:51.037
- MR. RAINES!
- RIGHT HERE!

32:51.070 --> 32:51.870
- MR. RAINES!
- MR. RAINES?

32:51.903 --> 32:53.239
- MR. RAINES,
ONE QUICK QUESTION.

32:53.272 --> 32:55.074
- WAS YOUR SON GAY?
- STEP BACK.

32:55.107 --> 32:57.976
[overlapping
reporters' questions]

33:15.361 --> 33:17.163
- THOSE,
UH, REPORTERS, UH,

33:17.196 --> 33:19.131
SAYING IT WAS GAY SEX,

33:19.165 --> 33:20.599
MY--MY SON IS NOT GAY.

33:20.632 --> 33:23.102
- WE DON'T THINK THAT'S
THE REASON THAT HE WAS THERE.

33:23.135 --> 33:26.472
- IT WAS A ROBBERY.
YOU SAID HIS WALLET WAS STOLEN.

33:26.505 --> 33:28.607
- MR. RAINES, UM,

33:28.640 --> 33:32.478
THERE WERE A LOT OF BLOWS
TO HIS HEAD.

33:32.511 --> 33:37.216
CAN YOU THINK OF ANYONE
THAT MIGHT BE ANGRY AT YOUR SON?

33:37.249 --> 33:38.617
- YOU'RE SAYING
SOMEONE WHO KNEW TRIPP DID THIS?

33:38.650 --> 33:42.354
THAT--
THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

33:42.388 --> 33:47.626
- CAN YOU TELL US
ABOUT ARTURO RIVERA?

33:47.659 --> 33:49.828
- ARTURO?

33:49.861 --> 33:53.299
UH, OUR HOUSEKEEPER'S SON?

33:53.332 --> 33:56.735
HE'S A--HE'S A SWEET KID.
WHY?

33:56.768 --> 33:58.404
- WELL,
AS FAR AS WE KNOW,

33:58.437 --> 34:01.140
HE WAS THE LAST PERSON
TO TALK TO TRIPP.

34:01.173 --> 34:04.143
ARTURO'S MOTHER WORKED FOR YOU
UNTIL RECENTLY.

34:04.176 --> 34:05.477
DID YOU FIRE HER?

34:05.511 --> 34:08.214
- UH, NO.
NO, IT WAS NOTHING LIKE THAT.

34:08.247 --> 34:09.748
- WHY DID SHE LEAVE THEN?

34:09.781 --> 34:14.620
- OFF THE RECORD?
IMMIGRATION ISSUES.

34:14.653 --> 34:18.657
WITH MY CAMPAIGN,
I HAVE TO BE ABOVE BOARD,

34:18.690 --> 34:20.592
AND WE CLEARED IT UP,
PAID THE BACK TAXES.

34:20.626 --> 34:23.229
I GAVE HER
A VERY GENEROUS SETTLEMENT.

34:23.262 --> 34:26.365
- IS IT, UM,
IS IT POSSIBLE

34:26.398 --> 34:28.867
THAT HER SON
STILL CARRIED SOME RESENTMENT?

34:28.900 --> 34:32.204
- YEAH,
I SUPPOSE IT'S POSSIBLE.

34:32.238 --> 34:35.441
BUT THERE'S NO WAY
ARTURO DID THIS.

34:35.474 --> 34:37.509
- YOU SOUND SURE.

34:37.543 --> 34:40.446
- HE'S SMALL FOR HIS AGE.

34:40.479 --> 34:42.314
HE'S SLOW,
HE DOESN'T HAVE THE PHYSICALITY.

34:42.348 --> 34:45.617
TRIPP WAS AN ATHLETE!

34:45.651 --> 34:47.586
EVERYTHING HE DID, HE WAS--
[chokes up]

34:47.619 --> 34:49.621
HE WAS A STAR.

34:49.655 --> 34:52.258
[sobs]

34:59.565 --> 35:02.334
- I DON'T CARE
HOW GREAT AN ATHLETE TRIPP WAS,

35:02.368 --> 35:04.436
ARTURO LOOKS GOOD FOR THIS.

35:04.470 --> 35:07.473
ALL THAT RAGE. ALL--
- JUST OVER A GIRL?

35:07.506 --> 35:08.640
I DON'T SEE IT.

35:08.674 --> 35:09.741
- NO, SOMETHING ELSE
PUT HIM OVER THE EDGE.

35:09.775 --> 35:12.411
- I MEAN, THAT STORY
ABOUT WHY HIS MOM WAS LET GO.

35:12.444 --> 35:15.481
I MEAN,
DOES THAT RING TRUE?

35:15.514 --> 35:17.416
- NO.

35:17.449 --> 35:19.485
- WE DID SOME DIGGING
AT I.N.S., CAPTAIN,

35:19.518 --> 35:20.786
INEZ RIVERA,

35:20.819 --> 35:23.322
SHE'S BEEN A NATURALIZED CITIZEN
FOR OVER 15 YEARS.

35:23.355 --> 35:24.756
- SO RAINES WAS LYING.

35:24.790 --> 35:27.393
- NOT ABOUT THE SETTLEMENT.
SIX MONTHS AGO

35:27.426 --> 35:29.895
HE WIRED A QUARTER OF A MIL
INTO HER SAVINGS ACCOUNT.

35:29.928 --> 35:30.896
- NOW THAT'S
A HEALTHY SEVERANCE.

35:30.929 --> 35:32.164
- UH, THERE'S MORE.

35:32.198 --> 35:37.236
IT TURNS OUT THAT HER CO-OP WAS
PURCHASED FOR HER LAST MARCH.

35:37.269 --> 35:38.770
ALL CASH.

35:38.804 --> 35:41.640
I TRACED IT BACK
TO ANOTHER RAINES FAMILY TRUST.

35:41.673 --> 35:44.276
- PEOPLE LIKE RAINES
FORGET THE HELP'S EVEN AROUND.

35:44.310 --> 35:45.877
MAYBE INEZ
STUMBLED ONTO SOMETHING

35:45.911 --> 35:47.246
HE DIDN'T WANT TO GET OUT.

35:47.279 --> 35:48.614
- SHE DOESN'T STRIKE ME
AS A BLACKMAILER,

35:48.647 --> 35:51.217
SHE SEEMED GENUINELY CONCERNED
FOR THE FAMILY.

35:51.250 --> 35:52.050
- BUT SHE'S A SINGLE MOM.

35:52.083 --> 35:53.885
I MEAN,
SHE CARES FOR HER SON MORE.

35:53.919 --> 35:55.887
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
SHE WASN'T ALWAYS A SINGLE MOM.

35:55.921 --> 35:58.857
ON THE KID'S BIRTH CERTIFICATE,
SHE LISTS A HUSBAND,

35:58.890 --> 36:01.427
RICARDO RIVERA,
AS THE FATHER.

36:01.460 --> 36:02.494
- WELL,
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?

36:02.528 --> 36:04.596
- WELL,
LET'S FIND OUT.

36:04.630 --> 36:07.599
THEY GOT DIVORCED
FIVE YEARS AGO.

36:07.633 --> 36:08.900
AND ON
THE DIVORCE CERTIFICATE,

36:08.934 --> 36:11.503
THEY BOTH STATE THAT
THEY HAD NO CHILDREN TOGETHER.

36:11.537 --> 36:13.539
- WHAT, SO HE WAS ARTURO'S DAD
WHEN HE WAS BORN,

36:13.572 --> 36:16.442
BUT EIGHT YEARS LATER, THEY
BOTH SAY THAT THE KID'S NOT HIS?

36:16.475 --> 36:17.876
- WELL, THAT'S
A GOOD REASON TO GET DIVORCED,

36:17.909 --> 36:19.678
AND FOR ARTURO TO BE ANGRY.

36:19.711 --> 36:23.415
- A SETTLEMENT.
IT'S NOT SEVERANCE.

36:23.449 --> 36:26.218
IT'S CHILD SUPPORT.

36:28.487 --> 36:29.855
- WE JUST
WANT TO FIGURE OUT

36:29.888 --> 36:31.790
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR FRIEND TRIPP.

36:31.823 --> 36:33.659
- I SWEAR,
I DON'T KNOW.

36:33.692 --> 36:34.793
- I'M NOT SAYING YOU DO.

36:34.826 --> 36:37.529
BUT WE DO KNOW YOU WERE
THE LAST PERSON HE TALKED TO.

36:37.563 --> 36:40.232
- I TOLD YOU, HE SAID
HE WANTED TO COME OVER TO MY--

36:40.266 --> 36:41.867
- I KNOW WHAT YOU TOLD ME,
ARTURO.

36:41.900 --> 36:45.003
I JUST DON'T SEE
SOMEONE LIKE TRIPP

36:45.036 --> 36:48.674
ASKIN' TO COME UP
TO WASHINGTON HEIGHTS, YOU KNOW?

36:48.707 --> 36:51.977
I MEAN, HE'D EXPECT YOU
TO MEET HIM, RIGHT?

36:52.010 --> 36:54.746
- ARTURO, YOU HAD YOUR
CELL PHONE YESTERDAY, RIGHT?

36:54.780 --> 36:56.415
ALL DAY?

36:56.448 --> 36:58.417
WE HAVE TRIPP'S,
AND THAT MEANS

36:58.450 --> 37:03.589
THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO TRACK
WHERE BOTH OF YOU WERE.

37:03.622 --> 37:06.492
WE'RE GOING TO FIND
THAT YOU MET HIM IN THE PARK.

37:06.525 --> 37:08.327
AREN'T WE?
- YEAH.

37:08.360 --> 37:09.695
- YEAH.

37:09.728 --> 37:11.830
SO WHAT DID TRIPP WANT,
ARTURO?

37:11.863 --> 37:14.966
- HE SAID
HE NEEDED TO TALK TO ELLA,

37:15.000 --> 37:17.035
BUT HE WASN'T ALLOWED
TO CALL HER.

37:17.068 --> 37:18.670
HE ASKED ME TO BRING HER.

37:18.704 --> 37:20.038
- HOW'D ELLA FEEL
ABOUT THAT?

37:20.071 --> 37:21.707
- SHE WAS EXCITED.

37:21.740 --> 37:26.044
SHE PACKED A BAG. SHE THOUGHT
THEY WERE GOIN' AWAY TOGETHER.

37:26.077 --> 37:27.546
- THAT WASN'T TRIPP'S PLAN,
WAS IT?

37:27.579 --> 37:28.547
- NO.

37:28.580 --> 37:30.616
HE WAS REALLY MEAN TO HER.

37:30.649 --> 37:34.386
HE STARTED YELLING, WHY
DIDN'T SHE HAVE THE ABORTION?

37:34.420 --> 37:37.523
WHO DID SHE THINK SHE WAS?

37:37.556 --> 37:41.793
ELLA STARTED CRYING.
HER MAKEUP GOT ALL MESSY.

37:41.827 --> 37:43.529
TRIPP SAID
SHE LOOKED LIKE A CHEAP WHORE.

37:43.562 --> 37:45.431
- YOU DON'T USE THAT WORD,
MIJO.

37:47.599 --> 37:52.371
- ELLA, SHE'S YOUR FRIEND,
RIGHT?

37:52.404 --> 37:54.540
I WOULDN'T LET ANYONE
TREAT MY FRIEND LIKE THAT.

37:54.573 --> 37:56.908
- [sighs]
I TOLD HIM TO LEAVE HER ALONE.

37:56.942 --> 37:58.710
- YEAH, BUT, TRIPP, RIGHT?

37:58.744 --> 38:02.047
HE'S USED TO GETTING HIS WAY,
RIGHT?

38:02.080 --> 38:03.882
- HE SAID
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

38:03.915 --> 38:06.051
THAT I NEVER SHOULD HAVE
BROUGHT THAT...

38:06.084 --> 38:08.920
GIRL TO HIS PARTY
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

38:08.954 --> 38:12.491
HE SAID IT WAS UP TO ME
TO TAKE CARE OF IT.

38:12.524 --> 38:14.626
HE TOOK OUT HIS WALLET.

38:14.660 --> 38:15.861
- WHAT,
HE GAVE YOU MONEY?

38:15.894 --> 38:17.763
- I WOULDN'T TAKE IT,

38:17.796 --> 38:22.434
SO TRIPP PUSHED ME DOWN
AND RUBBED MY FACE IN THE DIRT.

38:22.468 --> 38:24.803
HE SAID HE DIDN'T CARE
HOW MUCH IT COST,

38:24.836 --> 38:28.607
THAT I'M GONNA MAKE SURE
SHE GETS RID OF THE DAMN BABY.

38:28.640 --> 38:30.008
[sighs] HE THREW
THE MONEY ON THE GROUND,

38:30.041 --> 38:32.444
AND STARTED TO WALK AWAY.

38:32.478 --> 38:34.012
- AFTER YOU TRIED
TO HELP HIM.

38:34.045 --> 38:35.814
- YOU CAN'T JUST
GIVE PEOPLE MONEY

38:35.847 --> 38:36.982
AND PRETEND
THEY DON'T EXIST.

38:37.015 --> 38:38.684
- YOU MEAN THE WAY

38:38.717 --> 38:43.855
TRIPP'S FATHER PAID YOU
AND YOUR MOTHER TO GO AWAY?

38:47.426 --> 38:51.597
- ARTURO,
WHAT DID YOU DO?

38:51.630 --> 38:54.933
- I'M SORRY, MOMMY.

38:54.966 --> 38:58.136
- ARTURO,

38:58.169 --> 38:59.705
TELL US WHAT HAPPENED.

38:59.738 --> 39:02.073
- [sighs]

39:02.107 --> 39:05.677
I PICKED UP A ROCK,
AND I THREW IT AT HIM.

39:05.711 --> 39:09.615
IT HIT HIS HEAD,
AND HE FELL DOWN.

39:09.648 --> 39:13.785
I PICKED UP THE ROCK
AND I HIT HIM AGAIN.

39:15.621 --> 39:16.688
- [sighs]

39:16.722 --> 39:18.790
MIJO.

39:18.824 --> 39:22.461
[crying]

39:22.494 --> 39:25.731
- ARTURO,
DID ELLA SEE YOU?

39:25.764 --> 39:28.434
- I TOLD HER TO RUN.

39:28.467 --> 39:32.671
I MADE HER PROMISE
NOT TO TELL.

39:32.704 --> 39:35.106
ELLA WAS MY FRIEND.

39:35.140 --> 39:38.009
THAT WAS MY HOUSE.

39:38.043 --> 39:39.911
ELLA SAID
HE COULD'VE MADE HER A PRINCESS.

39:39.945 --> 39:41.179
[sniffs]

39:41.212 --> 39:43.582
I COULD'VE MADE HER
A PRINCESS.

39:43.615 --> 39:45.951
- THAT'S RIGHT.

39:45.984 --> 39:48.554
YOU'RE A RAINES TOO.

39:49.721 --> 39:52.824
I'M A RAINES,
JUST LIKE TRIPP.

39:52.858 --> 39:54.826
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

39:54.860 --> 39:57.028
- [crying]
I KNOW ALL ABOUT IT.

40:00.098 --> 40:02.167
- WHEN DID YOU FIND OUT,
ARTURO?

40:02.200 --> 40:07.573
- AFTER NEW YEARS, I--
I THOUGHT I HEARD THEM IN--

40:07.606 --> 40:12.177
[sighs]
I HEARD THEM IN HIS BED.

40:12.210 --> 40:17.549
I BOUGHT ONE OF THOSE HOME TESTS
AT THE DRUG STORE.

40:17.583 --> 40:21.553
- A PATERNITY TEST?
- I SAW IT ON TV.

40:21.587 --> 40:24.189
I USED HIS TOOTHBRUSH,
I MAILED IT IN,

40:24.222 --> 40:26.725
THE RESULTS CAME BACK.

40:26.758 --> 40:30.095
THAT WAS MY DAD.

40:30.128 --> 40:33.064
- DID YOU SHOW IT TO HIM,
ARTURO?

40:33.098 --> 40:35.100
- ONLY ONE TIME.

40:35.133 --> 40:36.835
HE GOT REALLY MAD.

40:36.868 --> 40:41.206
THAT'S WHY
WE HAD TO MOVE AWAY.

40:41.239 --> 40:44.209
- DID YOU KNOW, MOMMY?

40:44.242 --> 40:46.177
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

40:48.279 --> 40:51.082
- I DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO GET HURT.

40:53.284 --> 40:56.988
- ARTURO,

40:57.022 --> 40:59.691
DID YOU TELL ANYONE
WHY YOU HAD TO MOVE?

40:59.725 --> 41:00.959
- NO.

41:00.992 --> 41:03.929
HE SAID IF I DID,
WE'D LOSE THE NEW APARTMENT.

41:03.962 --> 41:07.265
[sniffs]
ANYWAY, I DIDN'T CARE.

41:07.298 --> 41:10.802
- HE WAS THE ONLY ONE
I WANTED TO TALK TO ABOUT IT.

41:12.938 --> 41:16.241
- TELL HIM NOW.

41:16.274 --> 41:20.211
I MEAN...

41:20.245 --> 41:22.848
PRETEND HE'S OUT THERE,

41:22.881 --> 41:25.684
BEHIND THAT MIRROR.

41:29.655 --> 41:34.092
- I JUST WANTED YOU
TO CALL ME YOUR SON.

41:34.125 --> 41:37.796
I JUST WANTED YOU
TO SAY YOU LOVE ME.

41:37.829 --> 41:39.665
[sobs]

41:39.698 --> 41:43.969
WHY COULDN'T YOU?

41:44.002 --> 41:48.139
I'M YOUR SON TOO.

41:48.173 --> 41:51.943
- WHAT DID YOU DO?

41:51.977 --> 41:54.145
