I'’ve been turning
your rent in late,

10:08.825 --> 10:10.522
so you may want
to check your credit rating.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.873
You didn'’t.
I did.

10:12.960 --> 10:15.527
Also, if you'’ve been wondering
what happened

10:15.615 --> 10:18.966
to your fruit-of-the month
basket... well,

10:19.053 --> 10:21.272
here. The mangoes
were delicious.

10:21.359 --> 10:23.144
Is there more?

10:23.231 --> 10:24.885
No, that'’s it.

10:24.972 --> 10:28.149
I'’m sorry, and I hope
you can forgive me.

10:28.236 --> 10:29.803
Amazing.

10:29.890 --> 10:32.283
Thank you.

10:32.370 --> 10:33.937
No, I mean, it'’s amazing

10:34.024 --> 10:35.896
you think you can throw
a few bucks around,

10:35.983 --> 10:37.811
wave a magic wand,
and suddenly,

10:37.898 --> 10:39.377
you'’re not a horrible
human being anymore.

10:39.464 --> 10:41.945
Well, that would be ideal.

10:42.032 --> 10:43.773
Well, I don'’t forgive you.

10:43.860 --> 10:45.993
Oh, come on, Beverly.
I'’m really trying here.

10:46.080 --> 10:47.908
No you'’re not.
You'’re just flappin'’ your gums

10:47.995 --> 10:49.692
and hoping
I let you off the hook.

10:49.779 --> 10:51.389
But you know what?

10:51.476 --> 10:53.130
You'’re a liar
and an addict, and...

10:53.217 --> 10:55.437
And I have no respect
for people like you.

10:55.524 --> 10:57.700
And you can keep your money!

10:57.787 --> 10:59.615
Oh.

10:59.702 --> 11:02.009
I don'’t see how
this is keeping me sober.

11:07.057 --> 11:08.798
That top looks
great on you.

11:08.885 --> 11:11.192
Thanks. I'’m kind of
diggin'’ yours.

11:12.802 --> 11:14.456
Bonnie, is the
brisket okay?

11:14.543 --> 11:17.241
Yeah, just not much
of an appetite.

11:17.328 --> 11:18.895
She'’s a little depressed

11:18.982 --> 11:21.332
because she found out
how much people hate her.

11:21.419 --> 11:23.117
Not people. Person.

11:23.204 --> 11:24.466
No, I asked around.

11:24.553 --> 11:26.250
It'’s people.

11:26.337 --> 11:27.991
I find that hard to believe.

11:28.078 --> 11:30.167
You'’re always so, uh...

11:30.254 --> 11:31.821
I'’m always so what?

11:31.908 --> 11:34.650
At the moment, scary.

11:36.696 --> 11:39.960
Uh, I'’m-I'’m just gonna
clear this stuff away.

11:40.047 --> 11:42.440
You have him trained well.

11:42.527 --> 11:43.877
I can'’t take credit for that.

11:43.964 --> 11:45.313
His mom broke him pretty good.

11:45.400 --> 11:47.228
It'’s true.

11:49.578 --> 11:51.406
You guys seem like
you'’re doing great.

11:51.493 --> 11:53.451
We are. You know,
a couple nights ago,

11:53.538 --> 11:55.802
we stayed up talking
until 2:00 in the morning.

11:55.889 --> 11:56.933
About what?

11:57.020 --> 11:58.848
All kinds of stuff.

11:58.935 --> 12:00.937
Did you know that George Bush'’s
dad was president, too?

12:03.331 --> 12:06.203
Fascinating.

12:06.290 --> 12:08.292
So, how is he in the sack?

12:08.379 --> 12:09.598
CHRISTY:
Mom!

12:09.685 --> 12:10.730
You do not have to answer that.

12:10.817 --> 12:12.557
Oh, come on.

12:12.644 --> 12:14.734
I'’m missing Sunday night
football. Give me something.

12:14.821 --> 12:16.779
All right, this is kind of cute.

12:16.866 --> 12:18.868
Suddenly you'’re curious.

12:18.955 --> 12:22.393
Well, she is my best friend.

12:22.480 --> 12:24.395
After we, like...

12:24.482 --> 12:26.397
you know, do it,

12:26.484 --> 12:28.356
he giggles.

12:28.443 --> 12:30.227
Why? Is he ticklish?

12:30.314 --> 12:32.229
Seriously?

12:32.316 --> 12:34.884
He'’s giggling because he
can'’t believe his good luck.

12:34.971 --> 12:35.929
[laughter]

12:36.016 --> 12:38.583
What was so funny?

12:38.670 --> 12:40.542
Oh, nothing.

12:40.629 --> 12:41.717
You know us girls.

12:41.804 --> 12:43.110
We just love to giggle.

12:44.285 --> 12:46.026
Multiple times.

12:47.244 --> 12:49.159
I'’ll get dessert.

12:51.074 --> 12:52.772
I have to tell you,

12:52.859 --> 12:54.469
Violet has been
a totally different person

12:54.556 --> 12:55.644
the last few days.

12:55.731 --> 12:56.863
How so?

12:56.950 --> 12:58.212
Well, she'’s...

12:58.299 --> 13:00.780
What'’s the right word? Happy.

13:00.867 --> 13:03.260
Me, too, and I know

13:03.347 --> 13:05.219
you'’re the one
who encouraged her

13:05.306 --> 13:07.874
to mend fences with me,
and I can'’t thank you enough.

13:07.961 --> 13:09.179
You'’re welcome.

13:09.266 --> 13:10.833
Although to be
completely honest,

13:10.920 --> 13:13.009
I did have
a selfish motive.

13:13.096 --> 13:14.706
What do you mean?Well, as a psychotherapist,

13:14.794 --> 13:17.405
I know that if a woman
has a positive relationship

13:17.492 --> 13:19.450
with her mother,
she'’s more likely

13:19.537 --> 13:22.192
to forge strong bonds
with her own children.

13:22.279 --> 13:23.454
Sorry.

13:23.541 --> 13:26.066
Too late.

13:26.153 --> 13:29.112
Anyway, I, uh,
can'’t wait to be a father,

13:29.199 --> 13:32.376
and you and Violet getting along
will only make her a better mom.

13:34.248 --> 13:36.163
I get that,

13:36.250 --> 13:38.339
but you can wait
a little while, right?

13:38.426 --> 13:40.863
Oh, yeah, well,
we'’re not even married yet.

13:40.950 --> 13:43.300
On the other hand,
I'’m not getting any younger.

13:43.387 --> 13:45.999
True, You wait too long,
you'’ll be shootin'’ sawdust.

13:47.174 --> 13:48.784
Mom!

13:48.871 --> 13:51.831
Well, where do you think
sawdust comes from?

13:53.920 --> 13:57.837
You have lots of time
to have kids.

13:57.924 --> 14:00.317
And I know
that Violet'’s not in a rush.

14:00.404 --> 14:02.363
She wants to finish college,

14:02.450 --> 14:05.496
maybe even start a career
before she has another baby.

14:05.583 --> 14:07.281
I'’m sorry. Anotherbaby?

14:07.368 --> 14:09.805
Huh?

14:09.892 --> 14:13.896
You just said,
"Before she has another baby."

14:13.983 --> 14:15.332
Yeah, you did
just say that.

14:15.419 --> 14:16.464
Why'’d you say that?

14:16.551 --> 14:18.727
Huh?

14:18.814 --> 14:22.122
Are you telling me
that Violet had a baby?

14:24.298 --> 14:27.388
I think it'’s charming
you giggle after sex.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.220
Who'’s ready for banana cream?

14:33.307 --> 14:35.265
What'’s wrong?

14:36.832 --> 14:38.747
Excuse me.

14:40.836 --> 14:43.143
What'’s going on?

14:43.230 --> 14:47.930
Violet, I assumed
you told him about the baby.

14:48.017 --> 14:49.801
Oh, God.

14:49.889 --> 14:51.151
I'’m so sorry.

14:53.327 --> 14:56.896
I do so much better
when you are not in my life.

14:58.810 --> 15:02.945
[sighs]

15:03.032 --> 15:05.208
I know how upset
you must be,

15:05.295 --> 15:07.210
but if we leave now,

15:07.297 --> 15:09.996
we can get home in time
to see the fourth quarter.

15:12.694 --> 15:15.175
[cheering on TV]

15:15.262 --> 15:16.959
What are you
looking at?

15:17.046 --> 15:19.440
Pictures of me and Violet,
back when she loved me.

15:20.876 --> 15:22.878
Oh, that'’s a good one.

15:22.965 --> 15:24.314
When did you take that?

15:24.401 --> 15:25.837
Three hours ago.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.970
[knocking]

15:30.407 --> 15:32.279
[turns TV off,
Bonnie sighs]

15:35.151 --> 15:37.588
Ugh!

15:37.675 --> 15:39.329
I want to apologize.

15:42.724 --> 15:45.292
To me?

15:45.379 --> 15:48.686
The other day, I said some
things I'’m not proud of.

15:48.773 --> 15:50.036
To me?

15:50.123 --> 15:51.385
Yeah.

15:51.472 --> 15:54.040
Okay.

15:54.127 --> 15:56.346
My dad was a drunk.

16:01.047 --> 16:03.527
He did some horrible things,
and then he'’d just say,

16:03.614 --> 16:05.094
"Sorry, I'’ll never do it again."

16:05.181 --> 16:07.140
And then he'’d do it again.

16:07.227 --> 16:11.187
So when you apologized...
it kind of set me off.

16:11.274 --> 16:14.190
Beverly, I had no idea.

16:14.277 --> 16:16.236
How could you?

16:16.323 --> 16:18.412
Anyway, I realize
you'’re not him,

16:18.499 --> 16:21.371
and it wasn'’t fair
to talk to you the way I did.

16:21.458 --> 16:23.939
Thank you.

16:24.026 --> 16:25.941
I'’m sorry.

16:26.028 --> 16:28.248
I'’m sorry, too.

16:28.335 --> 16:31.033
Thanks.

16:31.120 --> 16:32.992
Wait! Beverly?

16:33.079 --> 16:35.951
You want to come in
for some tea and football?

16:36.038 --> 16:38.475
Okay.

16:40.477 --> 16:42.349
Hi, Christy.

16:42.436 --> 16:44.394
Hi.

16:44.481 --> 16:46.875
You know, you two
have a lot in common.

16:46.962 --> 16:48.920
Her mom was a drunk.

17:07.461 --> 17:09.376
[sighs]

17:10.681 --> 17:12.553
[phone plays tune]

17:12.640 --> 17:14.598
It'’s Violet.

17:14.685 --> 17:16.035
Ooh.

17:19.864 --> 17:22.650
Hey, Vi. What'’s goin'’ on?

17:22.737 --> 17:26.088
I just wanted to apologize
for what I said last night.

17:26.175 --> 17:28.351
Okay.

17:28.438 --> 17:29.439
[whispering]:
She'’s apologizing.

17:29.526 --> 17:30.440
To who?
To me.

17:30.527 --> 17:33.574
Why?
No idea.

17:33.661 --> 17:36.446
Honey, um, I'’m the one
who should be apologizing.

17:38.361 --> 17:39.884
No, it was my fault.

17:39.971 --> 17:42.104
I should have told Gregory
about the baby,

17:42.191 --> 17:45.499
but... I was too scared.

17:45.586 --> 17:47.892
I understand.

17:47.979 --> 17:51.505
Just know that Grandma and I
will always lie for you,

17:51.592 --> 17:53.246
but you got
to give us a heads up.

17:53.333 --> 17:56.075
Tell her lying'’s
what makes us a family.

17:56.162 --> 17:58.077
Szh-szh-szh. Szh.

18:00.122 --> 18:02.037
So how'’s it going with Gregory?

18:02.124 --> 18:06.041
Not good. He'’s real upset.

18:06.128 --> 18:09.740
Violet, not that you asked
for my opinion...

18:09.827 --> 18:11.742
Oh, boy.

18:11.829 --> 18:15.006
But in my experience, when
you screw up and get caught--

18:15.094 --> 18:17.008
something I'’ve done a lot--

18:17.096 --> 18:19.750
it'’s usually best
to take responsibility

18:19.837 --> 18:21.230
and deal with the consequences.

18:23.928 --> 18:25.582
You think he'’ll forgive me?

18:25.669 --> 18:27.889
Honey, you'’re 22 years younger
than he is.

18:27.976 --> 18:30.370
He'’d forgive you
for burning down his house.

18:30.457 --> 18:32.372
You might be right.

18:32.459 --> 18:33.634
[whispering]:
I might be right.

18:35.636 --> 18:37.768
More importantly, Violet,

18:37.855 --> 18:40.293
do you want to stay
with Gregory?

18:41.468 --> 18:43.252
I do.

18:43.339 --> 18:46.908
Well, then, if you hang in there
and work it out,

18:46.995 --> 18:50.738
I guarantee you'’ll have him
giggling again in no time.

18:52.218 --> 18:53.784
Thanks, Mom.

18:53.871 --> 18:55.221
I love you.

18:55.308 --> 18:57.962
I love you, too.

19:09.235 --> 19:12.325
You'’ve become a good mom.

19:12.412 --> 19:14.022
Thank you.

19:17.156 --> 19:19.027
I'’m not gonna say it back.
