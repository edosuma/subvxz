00:00.083 --> 00:01.959
<i>Previously on </i>Desperate Housewives.

00:02.041 --> 00:03.834
Does she know you killed your wife?

00:03.917 --> 00:05.166
<i>Secrets were uncovered.</i>

00:05.250 --> 00:06.625
Honey, I'm home.

00:06.709 --> 00:08.000
<i>Carlos came back.</i>

00:08.083 --> 00:09.917
Whatever you want to do,
I'm in your corner.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.542
<i>Lynette made a promise.</i>

00:11.625 --> 00:12.667
Mr Faladi.

00:12.750 --> 00:14.125
I love him and he loves me.

00:14.208 --> 00:17.125
<i>And Bree's daughter fell for her</i>
<i>history teacher.</i>

00:17.875 --> 00:19.166
<i>While Mike's history...</i>

00:19.250 --> 00:21.500
He's suffered significant memory loss.

00:21.583 --> 00:23.667
<i>...was being carefully rewritten.</i>

00:23.750 --> 00:25.917
- Susan Mayer.
- We were close, huh?

00:26.000 --> 00:28.500
That tramp treated you like dirt.

00:31.083 --> 00:33.333
<i>The art of sabotage.</i>

00:33.417 --> 00:36.875
<i>It's practised every day in the suburbs.</i>

00:36.959 --> 00:39.875
<i>Sometimes it takes</i>
<i>the form of a bundt cake,</i>

00:39.959 --> 00:43.375
<i>offered to a friend who's on a diet.</i>

00:44.000 --> 00:45.917
<i>Other times it's a cable,</i>

00:46.000 --> 00:50.125
<i>cut just as a husband's friends</i>
<i>arrive to watch the big game.</i>

00:51.333 --> 00:54.208
<i>And there's always</i>
<i>that anonymous phone call</i>

00:54.291 --> 00:56.667
<i>to the city zoning department.</i>

00:57.458 --> 01:02.375
<i>Yes, in suburbia everyone you meet</i>
<i>is a potential saboteur.</i>

01:02.917 --> 01:06.166
<i>Absolutely everyone.</i>

01:06.625 --> 01:09.792
Good afternoon. I'm Bree Hodge.
And you are?

01:09.875 --> 01:12.041
Name's Gus and we're all booked up.

01:12.125 --> 01:14.875
Actually, Gus,
I'm here to see one of your guests.

01:14.959 --> 01:16.917
A gentleman named Faladi.

01:18.125 --> 01:20.792
He came in about an hour ago.
You want me to call him for you?

01:20.875 --> 01:23.709
No, no, no. I'd like you to take me
to his room and unlock it

01:23.792 --> 01:25.542
so I can walk in unannounced.

01:26.834 --> 01:29.875
Lady, I can't do that.
Besides, he has a girl in there.

01:29.959 --> 01:32.750
Yes, I know. She's my daughter.

01:32.834 --> 01:34.917
My 17-year-old daughter.

01:35.917 --> 01:39.709
Yeah. That would be Room 17.

01:40.291 --> 01:42.750
There's irony for you.

01:43.250 --> 01:47.041
You don't have a gun in there, do you?
Because I just put down new carpet.

01:47.125 --> 01:49.083
Gus, I don't plan anything unpleasant.

01:49.166 --> 01:51.500
I'm simply going to inform Mr Faladi

01:51.583 --> 01:54.959
what repercussions he faces
if he continues this relationship,

01:55.041 --> 01:57.500
and trust him to see reason.

02:02.709 --> 02:05.834
- What the hell?
- Mom, what are you doing here?

02:05.917 --> 02:09.291
- How could you do this to me?
- What makes you think that you can...

02:09.375 --> 02:12.417
<i>Yes, the art of sabotage.</i>

02:12.500 --> 02:15.417
<i>It's practised every day in the suburbs.</i>

02:15.500 --> 02:19.792
I told you, it's over.
Didn't you hear her?

02:19.875 --> 02:23.250
- So how did it go?
- Quite well, I think.

02:23.333 --> 02:27.583
<i>But few do it as well as Bree Hodge.</i>

02:28.417 --> 02:32.583
Oh, and Gus, the carpet is beautiful.

02:34.125 --> 02:36.709
<i>Or as politely.</i>

03:19.083 --> 03:20.750
<i>Family dinner.</i>

03:20.834 --> 03:25.125
<i>There was a time when that phrase</i>
<i>meant something on Wisteria Lane.</i>

03:25.542 --> 03:29.667
<i>Of course, this was back when meals</i>
<i>were lovingly prepared</i>

03:30.709 --> 03:32.917
<i>by wives who loved to cook</i>

03:35.375 --> 03:38.083
<i>for children who remembered</i>
<i>their manners.</i>

03:40.667 --> 03:45.041
<i>But family dinners, like the times,</i>
<i>had changed.</i>

03:45.834 --> 03:48.500
<i>And there was only one house</i>
<i>in the neighbourhood</i>

03:48.583 --> 03:51.875
<i>where dinner remained</i>
<i>a family occasion.</i>

03:53.667 --> 03:56.750
<i>And attendance was not optional.</i>

03:58.792 --> 04:01.875
I don't know when I've tasted
such tender spring lamb.

04:01.959 --> 04:04.291
Thank you, dear.

04:04.375 --> 04:06.792
Danielle, you haven't touched
your dinner.

04:06.875 --> 04:09.667
She doesn't like spring lamb.
She prefers old goat.

04:11.458 --> 04:14.709
I'm glad you guys think it's so funny
that my life is over.

04:14.792 --> 04:16.875
Your mother was right
to end that relationship.

04:16.959 --> 04:19.291
The man was your teacher
and married.

04:19.375 --> 04:20.625
He's getting a divorce.

04:20.709 --> 04:23.917
That hardly bolsters his suitability.
Danielle, please eat something.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.291
Don't worry, dear.
Hunger strikes demand self-control.

04:26.375 --> 04:29.417
And as we've seen,
that's hardly her strong suit.

04:29.500 --> 04:31.291
When are you gonna
take me seriously?

04:31.375 --> 04:35.500
- When you start acting like an adult.
- She sleeps with them. That's a start.

04:37.125 --> 04:40.166
I hate you! I hate all of you!

04:46.917 --> 04:48.458
Remind me to buy paper plates.

04:48.542 --> 04:52.083
We'll need them till a certain someone
can be trusted with china again.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.875
Wow. You're pretty good at that.

05:05.959 --> 05:09.041
- Hey. You are home early. Hi.
- Yes, I am.

05:09.125 --> 05:14.125
- What is all this?
- We are having a celebration.

05:14.208 --> 05:17.959
- Sit.
- What are we celebrating?

05:18.041 --> 05:22.458
You being the greatest wife
in the world.

05:23.291 --> 05:25.333
Thanks.

05:25.417 --> 05:29.250
- No, seriously though.
- I mean it.

05:29.333 --> 05:32.709
How many wives would tell
their husbands to follow his dreams

05:32.792 --> 05:37.792
and then have the patience to wait
while he figures out what the hell it is?

05:37.875 --> 05:41.041
Oh, my God. You know
what you want to do. That's fantastic.

05:41.125 --> 05:43.959
- What is it?
- Wait for it. Wait for it.

05:44.041 --> 05:46.333
Okay, I knew I needed to spend
my days doing something

05:46.417 --> 05:50.250
I was passionate about.
Something creative. Yeah, have at it.

05:50.333 --> 05:53.750
Something where I interacted with
the public, but I was still my own boss.

05:53.834 --> 05:56.709
And then, this morning, it just hit me.

05:56.792 --> 06:00.583
Okay, okay, I'm dying here.
What's the dream?

06:01.417 --> 06:03.542
You're eating it.

06:04.333 --> 06:08.625
- Excuse me?
- I'm gonna open up a pizza parlour!

06:09.417 --> 06:11.583
I bet you didn't see that one coming.

06:11.667 --> 06:14.959
No. That was a real Frisbee
to the head, that one.

06:15.041 --> 06:17.709
But when you think about it,
doesn't it make perfect sense?

06:17.792 --> 06:19.792
I mean, marinara's in my blood.

06:19.875 --> 06:21.875
You remember Uncle Vito?
He came to this country with nothing.

06:21.959 --> 06:24.750
He turned that trattoria
into a gold mine.

06:24.834 --> 06:29.041
Isn't he the one that asked us
for a loan last Christmas?

06:29.125 --> 06:32.208
He has a gambling problem,
but don't blame the pizza.

06:32.291 --> 06:34.792
Trust me.
I've got this thing all mapped out.

06:34.875 --> 06:36.667
It's gonna have a real family feel.

06:36.750 --> 06:39.083
With big portions, but small prices.

06:39.166 --> 06:41.291
Crayons for the kids.

06:41.375 --> 06:43.667
God, I feel good about this.

06:46.750 --> 06:48.834
So what do you think?

06:50.792 --> 06:55.458
I think I'm gonna open
another bottle of wine.

06:55.583 --> 07:00.208
- But we haven't finished this one.
- Well, hey, we're celebrating, right?

07:11.417 --> 07:14.375
Carlos, what are you
doing in my room?

07:14.458 --> 07:16.208
Oh, hey, Gabby. You're home early.

07:16.291 --> 07:19.166
God, Carlos.
Strawberries and champagne?

07:19.250 --> 07:21.375
Did you really think you were
gonna seduce me?

07:21.458 --> 07:23.625
- Never entered my mind.
- Right. Right.

07:23.709 --> 07:26.458
You know, I may be living with you
until the divorce is final,

07:26.542 --> 07:30.000
but that doesn't mean I have to put up
with your cheesy come-ons.

07:30.083 --> 07:32.166
- Gabby, can I just say one thing?
- What?

07:32.250 --> 07:35.250
You've been doing some thinking and
you realised that I'm your soul mate,

07:35.333 --> 07:37.959
and there's a vacancy in your heart
only I can fill?

07:38.041 --> 07:39.125
Gabby, listen.

07:39.208 --> 07:43.709
It's over between us.
Just move on already. Forget me.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.583
As I was trying to say,
I have company over.

07:55.667 --> 07:58.500
This is Trishelle.

07:59.959 --> 08:02.208
Trishelle, this is...

08:02.291 --> 08:04.917
What was your name, again?

08:05.000 --> 08:06.959
I seem to have forgotten.

08:14.583 --> 08:17.125
So the doctor said I should use
as many things as I can

08:17.208 --> 08:19.417
to jog your memory.
And not just pictures.

08:19.500 --> 08:22.750
He said I could use tastes
and smells and sounds.

08:22.834 --> 08:26.917
So tonight is <i>Sounds of the Seventies.</i>

08:30.959 --> 08:34.583
Okay, well, let me set the scene.

08:35.291 --> 08:37.500
We were at this funky little fish joint

08:37.583 --> 08:40.166
that you'd been dying to take me to,
Cappy's.

08:40.250 --> 08:42.166
Do you remember Cappy's?

08:43.583 --> 08:44.834
Okay, well, we were there.

08:44.917 --> 08:48.041
And we were just wolfing down
the most delicious trout ever.

08:48.125 --> 08:52.041
- How long till the music part?
- Oh, it's coming.

08:52.125 --> 08:54.875
And this '70s cover band,
well, they started to play.

08:54.959 --> 08:58.709
And that's how we got our song.

09:02.750 --> 09:04.792
Our song was <i>Car Wash?</i>

09:04.875 --> 09:07.667
Yes! See how much fun we were?

09:07.750 --> 09:10.000
So, I dragged you out
on to the dance floor

09:10.083 --> 09:12.625
and, well, you were giving me this look.

09:12.709 --> 09:14.583
Sort of like the look
you're giving me right now.

09:14.667 --> 09:16.834
And I started to do this.

09:18.959 --> 09:21.041
And then you did this.

09:22.917 --> 09:26.333
I'm sorry. This isn't working.

09:26.417 --> 09:29.166
Oh, Mike, come on,
you're not even trying to remember.

09:29.250 --> 09:30.792
It was fun!

09:30.875 --> 09:32.959
I know. Okay, sing with me.

09:42.375 --> 09:44.625
You know, I'm really beat.

09:45.417 --> 09:48.000
Okay, Mike,
I am not doing this to upset you.

09:48.083 --> 09:51.583
- I'm doing this to help.
- I get that.

09:51.667 --> 09:53.375
It's just...

09:53.458 --> 09:56.125
The music is giving me a headache.

09:56.208 --> 09:58.333
Okay, well, I'll go.

09:58.417 --> 10:00.500
But I am not giving up on you.

10:00.583 --> 10:03.750
You know, you are going to remember
the night that we danced to <i>Car Wash.</i>

10:03.834 --> 10:06.291
And not just because it was fun,
but because

10:06.375 --> 10:10.875
later that night we did some things
that, trust me, are worth remembering.

10:20.291 --> 10:23.083
That Jane Doe from the golf course...

10:23.166 --> 10:27.125
I think I missed something
at the autopsy. Check it out.

10:27.208 --> 10:29.667
You always got to come at lunch,
don't you?

10:29.750 --> 10:32.417
Those blue marks
on the back of her hand.

10:32.500 --> 10:35.750
At first, I thought they were veins.
Now I think it's ink.

10:36.041 --> 10:37.792
- You mean like some kind of writing?
- Yeah.

10:37.875 --> 10:41.792
I need to run some more tests,
see if I can get a clearer image.

10:41.875 --> 10:45.250
- I could be wrong, but...
- But what?

10:45.333 --> 10:47.625
I think it's a phone number.

10:53.709 --> 10:56.041
The oddest thing happened
at the club today.

10:56.125 --> 10:57.959
Tish Atherton...

11:00.250 --> 11:01.458
Andrew, would you be a dear

11:01.542 --> 11:04.041
and make sure your sister's
just breaking her own things?

11:10.917 --> 11:13.083
Anyway, Tish Atherton...

11:19.583 --> 11:21.417
Danielle?

11:41.333 --> 11:44.166
Yeah. I'll tell them.

11:44.250 --> 11:46.583
I'm telling you, it was a deliberate snub.

11:46.667 --> 11:48.917
I waved to her
and she looked right through me.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.333
True, I never bought
her eldest daughter a...

11:50.417 --> 11:51.542
Mom?

11:51.625 --> 11:54.000
Andrew, please don't interrupt me
while I'm speaking.

11:54.083 --> 11:55.917
True, I never bought her eldest
daughter a gift,

11:56.000 --> 12:00.375
but you know my policy.
No husband, no baby gift.

12:00.542 --> 12:03.291
Now what is it, dear?

12:03.375 --> 12:06.083
Danielle's upstairs
trying to commit suicide.

12:15.750 --> 12:18.250
There's no rush.
She's not trying that hard.

12:23.959 --> 12:27.041
How can you sit there playing
that ridiculous game?

12:27.125 --> 12:29.834
Your sister tried to kill herself.
That doesn't upset you?

12:29.917 --> 12:32.166
She tried to slit her wrists with a spoon.

12:32.250 --> 12:35.083
- How upset do you want me to be?
- Mrs Hodge?

12:35.166 --> 12:36.417
Is my daughter all right?

12:36.500 --> 12:38.667
She's a little groggy,
but she'll be fine.

12:38.750 --> 12:42.417
- The wounds are fairly superficial.
- So is the patient.

12:42.500 --> 12:44.041
We'll release her tonight.

12:44.125 --> 12:47.417
But you understand that in cases
like this, counselling is mandatory.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.542
Of course, we'll get her
all the help she needs.

12:49.625 --> 12:51.834
She is resisting our efforts
to pump her stomach.

12:51.917 --> 12:53.834
She says she only took
three sedatives.

12:53.917 --> 12:57.667
- She's disoriented. Pump her.
- Andrew!

12:59.458 --> 13:00.917
Pump her.

13:04.792 --> 13:07.625
They're sticking a tube
down her throat.

13:07.709 --> 13:09.166
Do you still think this is funny?

13:09.250 --> 13:11.417
Mom, this was a half-assed bid
for attention.

13:11.500 --> 13:12.792
This was a cry for help.

13:12.875 --> 13:14.417
And if we don't listen,
the next time she could

13:14.500 --> 13:16.500
do something even more dangerous.

13:16.583 --> 13:19.125
Yeah. Next time she might
jump off the porch.

13:19.208 --> 13:20.250
Will you stop it?

13:20.333 --> 13:22.375
Suicide is the worst thing
that can happen to a family!

13:22.458 --> 13:24.667
I will not have it made light of!

13:32.834 --> 13:37.125
Orson's right. We need to support
each other as a family.

13:37.208 --> 13:41.208
In fact, I say we all go for counselling.

13:48.625 --> 13:51.333
Did Tom actually say he's opening
up a pizza parlour?

13:51.417 --> 13:53.458
Lynette, you're not serious.

13:53.542 --> 13:55.542
Well, might as well stand in a vat
of tomato sauce

13:55.625 --> 13:56.917
and tear up $100 bills.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.083
I know,
but I said that I would support him

13:59.166 --> 14:00.458
and help him follow his dream.

14:00.542 --> 14:03.500
But he can't hold you to that.
Not if the dream is pizza.

14:03.583 --> 14:05.458
She promised to stand by him.

14:05.542 --> 14:08.125
And once you make that commitment,
you have to see it through.

14:08.208 --> 14:09.542
Yeah.

14:09.625 --> 14:13.291
- How's that divorce going?
- I'm done talking.

14:13.375 --> 14:15.583
Hey, Parker, be careful up there.

14:15.667 --> 14:18.041
I just keep thinking
he's gonna come to his senses

14:18.125 --> 14:20.208
and realise it's a bad idea.

14:20.291 --> 14:22.583
- That's never gonna happen.
- Why?

14:22.667 --> 14:24.959
Because men are
genetically incapable of realising

14:25.041 --> 14:26.875
that their dreams are stupid.

14:26.959 --> 14:28.750
Care to elaborate, Dr McCluskey?

14:28.834 --> 14:31.417
My husband sold insurance
for 36 years.

14:31.500 --> 14:33.834
And one day he woke up and decided
he wanted to move to Paris

14:33.875 --> 14:35.750
and paint naked ladies.

14:35.834 --> 14:38.542
I told him, "Gilbert,
you could barely paint the garage.

14:38.625 --> 14:41.333
"What makes you think
you can commit art?"

14:41.417 --> 14:43.667
And for the rest of his life
he despised me.

14:43.750 --> 14:46.875
He despised you for saying no?

14:46.959 --> 14:48.917
Well, he also thought
I was sleeping with his brother.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.333
And I'm sure that was
mixed in there, too.

14:56.542 --> 14:58.917
Okay, so I got Kayla all unpacked.

14:59.000 --> 15:02.291
Oh, great. So Tom will drop her off
at your house on Friday.

15:02.375 --> 15:05.208
Sounds good.
Lynette, can I talk to you for a second?

15:06.166 --> 15:08.083
Yeah.

15:13.291 --> 15:15.667
Okay, pardon me
for having really big ears,

15:15.750 --> 15:18.166
but I heard about Tom
and this pizza place.

15:18.250 --> 15:20.959
- Do you want to know what I think?
- No, not really.

15:21.041 --> 15:24.125
It sucks. It's a sucky idea.

15:24.208 --> 15:25.500
And your friends back there,

15:25.583 --> 15:27.917
they're just too nice
to come right out and say it.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.500
Luckily, I'm not your friend.

15:30.583 --> 15:32.834
So you can trust me.

15:33.041 --> 15:37.000
Nip it in the bud.

15:37.083 --> 15:39.917
And make Tom resent me
for the rest of his life?

15:40.000 --> 15:42.583
- I don't think so.
- You better do something.

15:42.667 --> 15:47.500
'Cause if you don't, you and me
will wind up working a pole

15:47.583 --> 15:49.542
to pay for braces.

15:57.917 --> 16:00.500
Hi, Julie. I bought you some flowers.

16:01.875 --> 16:04.959
Generally, when you buy flowers
they don't still have the roots on them.

16:05.041 --> 16:08.375
Okay, I was hoping you could help me
with my English lit paper.

16:08.458 --> 16:10.709
Hi. I'm Sarah.

16:10.792 --> 16:13.166
Hey. So what do you say?

16:13.250 --> 16:16.625
- Actually I'm sort of busy right now.
- Oh, come on.

16:16.709 --> 16:19.542
Look, Aunt Edie's gonna give me
the boot if I flunk out.

16:19.625 --> 16:21.917
- Wouldn't you miss me?
- Absolutely.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.542
Whose motorcycle would wake us
all up at 2:00 in the morning?

16:24.625 --> 16:26.375
You drive a motorcycle?

16:28.625 --> 16:32.125
Please. Look, I could really use
some help here.

16:34.375 --> 16:36.125
Normally, I charge 12 bucks an hour
for tutoring.

16:36.208 --> 16:38.917
But seeing as it's you, $15.

16:40.041 --> 16:42.959
Great. See you Friday.

16:44.417 --> 16:48.000
Oh, and just so you know,
I charge $15 an hour to make out.

16:48.083 --> 16:50.959
So I'll probably break even.

17:03.834 --> 17:06.667
Hi. You're new. Where's Marcy?

17:06.750 --> 17:09.625
She's in Honolulu on vacation.
Can I help you?

17:09.709 --> 17:12.875
- I'm just going to see Mike Delfino.
- What's that smell?

17:12.959 --> 17:14.375
That's my macaroni and cheese.

17:14.458 --> 17:16.375
I was hoping it would trigger
Mike's memory.

17:16.458 --> 17:18.667
I made it the first time
we met two years ago.

17:18.750 --> 17:20.500
You should have refrigerated it.

17:23.667 --> 17:25.375
Edie?

17:25.458 --> 17:27.583
Oh, you know Miss Britt?

17:27.667 --> 17:33.041
- Yeah. What is she doing here?
- Visiting Mr Delfino.

17:33.125 --> 17:35.875
You know she was with him
when he came out of his coma?

17:36.041 --> 17:38.625
- What?
- And she's been here every day since.

17:40.291 --> 17:42.417
You!

17:43.834 --> 17:46.583
Hello, Susan. Long time no see.

17:46.667 --> 17:48.542
I have been wondering
why Mike's been so cold to me

17:48.625 --> 17:49.792
and now it all makes sense.

17:49.875 --> 17:52.625
I'm sure I have no idea
what you're talking about.

17:52.709 --> 17:55.625
- For God sakes, take a bath.
- That's my mac and cheese.

17:55.709 --> 17:56.834
Don't change the subject.

17:56.917 --> 17:58.959
What have you been telling him
about me?

17:59.041 --> 18:03.458
Why would I say anything about you?
Mike has no idea who you are.

18:03.542 --> 18:06.917
- I envy him.
- Ladies, is there a problem?

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
I want this woman banned
from the hospital.

18:09.083 --> 18:12.125
She's been like this ever since
Mike dumped her.

18:12.208 --> 18:16.375
Imagine <i>Fatal Attraction</i>
with a much older woman.

18:16.458 --> 18:19.917
Ma'am, Mr Delfino
already has a visitor.

18:20.000 --> 18:23.250
- I think you should go.
- Me? But why doesn't she leave?

18:23.333 --> 18:25.834
I'm the one who's been here
every day for the last six months.

18:25.917 --> 18:29.500
Well, I don't know you,
but I do know his girlfriend.

18:31.458 --> 18:33.333
Girlfriend! Okay, you know what?

18:33.417 --> 18:36.417
I want Marcy's number in Honolulu
and I want it right now!

18:36.500 --> 18:37.625
You need to leave.

18:37.709 --> 18:41.000
- You're disturbing the other patients.
- What are you... This is ridiculous!

18:41.083 --> 18:43.583
I mean, who am I disturbing?
It's a coma ward.

18:43.667 --> 18:45.792
Don't you want them to wake up?

18:48.583 --> 18:51.333
- I did not call you that.
- Yes, you did!

18:51.417 --> 18:53.625
I have never in my life
used the word retard.

18:53.709 --> 18:55.875
It's what you think.
You think I'm this immature moron

18:55.959 --> 18:58.125
who can't be trusted
to decide what's best for her.

18:58.208 --> 19:00.041
Well, you did try to off yourself.

19:00.125 --> 19:02.792
I don't think you get to pull the
"I know what's best for me" card.

19:02.875 --> 19:05.125
Andrew, not in front of the therapist.

19:05.208 --> 19:07.583
Actually, I think
we're making great progress.

19:07.667 --> 19:12.542
You feel Danielle refuses to see
you're acting in her best interest.

19:12.625 --> 19:16.834
And you think your mother cares more
about her image than your feelings.

19:16.917 --> 19:19.750
Danielle, how can you think
I don't care about your feelings?

19:19.834 --> 19:22.458
Don't you know
how much your mother loves you?

19:22.542 --> 19:26.375
When I saw you in that tub,
it was the worst moment of my life.

19:26.458 --> 19:29.166
The thought of losing you
is more than I can bear.

19:29.250 --> 19:31.291
How does that make you feel?

19:34.417 --> 19:38.375
Actually, kind of powerful.

19:40.875 --> 19:44.709
- Powerful?
- You really don't want to lose me?

19:44.792 --> 19:46.083
Of course not.

19:46.166 --> 19:48.041
I already went through thinking
I'd lost Andrew.

19:48.125 --> 19:49.750
I can't go through that again.

19:49.834 --> 19:53.208
Well then,
here's what's going to happen.

19:53.291 --> 19:55.083
I'm going to start dating Robert again.

19:55.166 --> 19:58.375
And if you try to break us up
or get him fired,

19:58.458 --> 20:01.208
then I'm going to leave
and you will never see me again.

20:01.291 --> 20:02.375
Danielle.

20:02.458 --> 20:04.625
If that can survive on its own, so can I.

20:04.709 --> 20:09.458
You don't believe me?
Call my bluff. See what happens.

20:14.959 --> 20:19.041
So what do we owe you
for all this progress?

20:24.250 --> 20:25.917
Come on, Austin, concentrate.

20:26.041 --> 20:28.250
Okay, why did Iago betray Othello?

20:30.750 --> 20:34.208
Because the play would suck
if he didn't?

20:34.291 --> 20:35.875
What do you think you're doing?

20:37.291 --> 20:38.875
Sorry.

20:38.959 --> 20:41.500
No, no, no. We're here to work.

20:41.583 --> 20:44.291
And if my mom came home she'd flip.
Now, put that away.

20:48.625 --> 20:50.125
You said put it away.

20:50.959 --> 20:53.333
Look, if you think I'm gonna sit here

20:53.417 --> 20:55.500
and write your paper for you
while you're getting drunk...

20:55.583 --> 20:58.500
Just help me get it started.
Look, this is hard for me, all right?

20:58.583 --> 21:00.208
I didn't read
a lot of Shakespeare in juvie.

21:00.291 --> 21:02.333
I kind of majored
in not getting stabbed.

21:05.375 --> 21:08.083
Fine. I'll write your intro,
but then you're on your own.

21:08.166 --> 21:09.959
Thank you very much.

21:12.542 --> 21:16.667
So, why'd they send you to juvie,
anyway?

21:16.834 --> 21:18.959
They didn't. My mom did.

21:20.750 --> 21:21.959
Why?

21:23.291 --> 21:26.333
She had this boyfriend.
No job, big drunk.

21:26.417 --> 21:28.583
A real catch.

21:28.667 --> 21:30.917
One night he pops her one.
So I break a chair over his head.

21:31.000 --> 21:34.250
And she calls the cops. On me.

21:35.917 --> 21:40.375
- But you were protecting her.
- Yeah, that's what I thought.

21:41.709 --> 21:44.667
But the guy said he'd leave
if she didn't press charges and...

21:45.417 --> 21:48.709
Well, my mom doesn't
really like to be alone.

21:51.417 --> 21:53.041
You know what?

21:53.333 --> 21:54.875
You're tired.

21:54.959 --> 21:57.375
Why don't you lay down
for a couple minutes

21:57.458 --> 22:00.125
and I'll just do a page or two.

22:00.750 --> 22:02.750
You're a rock star, Mayer.

22:13.500 --> 22:17.000
Carlos. No Trishelle tonight?

22:17.083 --> 22:18.458
No.

22:18.542 --> 22:20.083
About her, I have a confession to make.

22:20.166 --> 22:21.917
Does her pimp want
the rest of the money?

22:22.000 --> 22:24.208
You know,
there is some cash in my purse.

22:24.291 --> 22:27.166
Look, I know I crossed a line
bringing her here,

22:27.250 --> 22:29.083
but I was trying to make you jealous.

22:29.166 --> 22:30.792
Like the way you made me feel

22:30.875 --> 22:33.667
when you said you slept
with John Rowland again.

22:33.750 --> 22:37.625
Well, I think it's more than that.
I think you really hate me.

22:37.709 --> 22:39.709
- That's not true.
- Oh, I think it is.

22:39.792 --> 22:43.625
You know, introducing your spouse to
someone you're about to have sex with.

22:43.709 --> 22:45.750
There's only one reason to do that.

22:46.625 --> 22:48.041
Pure hatred.

22:48.125 --> 22:50.166
You don't know
what you're talking about.

22:58.458 --> 22:59.917
Oh, I think I do.

23:05.667 --> 23:08.583
Phil, come meet
my basically ex-husband. Thank you.

23:08.667 --> 23:11.917
Carlos. Carlos, this is my new friend,
Phil Lopez.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.375
- We met, Gabby.
- Really?

23:14.458 --> 23:16.583
Well, that's weird. When?

23:16.667 --> 23:19.583
Fairview Chamber of Commerce,
the annual dinner.

23:19.667 --> 23:21.917
Oh, my God, that's right. That's right!

23:22.000 --> 23:25.625
You were up for the Latino
Businessman of the Year award

23:25.709 --> 23:27.291
that Phil won.

23:27.375 --> 23:30.625
- Well, actually, I beat him out twice.
- No!

23:30.709 --> 23:33.792
I remember. Carlos was so annoyed.

23:33.875 --> 23:35.583
What did you say, hon?

23:35.667 --> 23:39.542
"He may have that trophy,
but I've got you."

23:40.709 --> 23:42.500
Ain't life funny?

23:42.583 --> 23:44.750
Gabby, can we talk for a sec?

23:44.834 --> 23:47.250
Not right now.
Phil and I are getting in the hot tub.

23:47.792 --> 23:51.208
- Phil, did you bring your suit?
- You said I didn't have to.

23:51.375 --> 23:53.917
Not in front of Arloscay.

23:54.542 --> 23:56.500
Go outside. I'll meet you there.

24:00.083 --> 24:04.083
Phil Lopez?
You brought home Phil Lopez?

24:04.417 --> 24:07.000
I had no idea you hated me that much.

24:07.083 --> 24:09.166
Well, now you know.

24:16.542 --> 24:17.875
Hey, good news.

24:17.959 --> 24:20.834
My realtor found me
some sweet locations.

24:20.917 --> 24:23.041
That's great.

24:23.125 --> 24:26.709
Hey, could we talk about
this restaurant thing for a second?

24:26.792 --> 24:28.417
Yeah, what's up?

24:28.500 --> 24:30.083
I don't know if you noticed,

24:30.166 --> 24:33.417
but when you first pitched
the whole pizza concept,

24:33.500 --> 24:36.458
- I was a wee bit sceptical.
- Yeah, I sensed that.

24:36.542 --> 24:37.917
Of course, you did.
'Cause you're smart guy.

24:38.000 --> 24:43.000
Which is also why you're gonna
jump on the idea I have

24:43.083 --> 24:45.041
to make the whole thing work.

24:45.125 --> 24:47.250
- Okay, so, you're not bailing on me?
- No.

24:47.333 --> 24:51.291
- No, no, no. I am totally on board.
- Oh, good.

24:51.375 --> 24:54.208
You had me scared there for a second.
Okay.

24:54.291 --> 24:56.458
So, well, what is this great idea?

24:56.542 --> 25:00.250
I'm thinking, catering company.

25:02.166 --> 25:04.792
Start small, have an Italian theme,

25:04.875 --> 25:10.959
create some cash flow and then,
later on, expand into the pizza thing.

25:11.041 --> 25:14.500
- But that's not my dream.
- Well, think about it.

25:14.583 --> 25:18.875
You're gonna do all these fun parties.
People will start talking.

25:18.959 --> 25:22.208
"Hey, this is great food.
This guy should open a restaurant."

25:22.291 --> 25:24.083
"Yeah, yeah, I'd eat there."
And then, wham.

25:24.166 --> 25:28.792
Five short years later
you have a built-in customer base.

25:28.875 --> 25:31.917
But I said it's not my dream.
Pizza is my dream.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.417
I know, I know.
Catering's how you get there.

25:33.500 --> 25:35.917
So why can't I skip the catering
and go straight to the pizza?

25:36.000 --> 25:37.500
Because you'll fail.

25:38.875 --> 25:42.750
I'm sorry. God.
I shouldn't have said that.

25:42.834 --> 25:45.208
But you're gambling
with our life savings,

25:45.291 --> 25:49.125
- and you have no experience.
- You said that you'd support me.

25:52.959 --> 25:55.375
I'm trying to. I am trying to.

25:55.458 --> 25:59.041
But are you aware that 90%
of restaurants tank in their first year?

25:59.125 --> 26:00.959
Which means
that 10% of them make it.

26:01.041 --> 26:03.500
Why don't you ever think
that I would be one of them?

26:03.583 --> 26:06.375
No. No! Do me a favour.

26:08.166 --> 26:09.709
Don't answer that.

26:19.333 --> 26:21.667
Carlos!

26:21.834 --> 26:24.375
I'm making a snack for Phil.

26:24.917 --> 26:26.875
Do you want something to eat?

26:27.125 --> 26:31.542
Some sour grapes, perhaps?
Maybe a little crow?

26:40.083 --> 26:41.917
Okay, we need to move this over there.

26:42.000 --> 26:45.333
- Why?
- Feng shui.

26:45.417 --> 26:48.375
I don't know. Don't just stand there.
Help me.

26:56.792 --> 27:01.166
- Yes! Yes!
- Hey, don't start without me.

27:02.041 --> 27:04.083
No, no. Let's get something straight.

27:04.166 --> 27:06.166
You and I are not gonna have
sex tonight.

27:06.250 --> 27:07.792
What?

27:07.875 --> 27:09.917
I'm sorry. No offence.
You're a nice guy.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.875
I'm just not into you that way.

27:12.500 --> 27:15.125
God, Phil, yes, yes.

27:15.208 --> 27:17.417
- Give it to me.
- Okay.

27:17.500 --> 27:19.917
I'm not talking to you. Back off.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.834
But I thought...
I mean, in the hot tub, we were...

27:23.667 --> 27:24.875
Yes, you saw my boobs.

27:24.959 --> 27:26.625
And you're gonna have
that mental snapshot to use

27:26.709 --> 27:28.041
as you wish for the rest of your life.

27:28.125 --> 27:31.125
That is all you're getting.

27:32.041 --> 27:34.750
Wait, wait. So you're just using me?

27:35.834 --> 27:37.875
- Unbelievable.
- I am what?

27:37.959 --> 27:40.375
- You're unbelievable!
- Really?

27:40.458 --> 27:44.333
So are you, big boy. Yes!

27:50.750 --> 27:54.250
No wonder you're divorcing her.
She's a straight-up loon.

27:54.333 --> 27:56.542
Crap. She's blocking my car.

27:57.959 --> 28:00.625
Always happy to help a brother out.

28:00.709 --> 28:02.542
Hold on.

28:04.500 --> 28:07.125
Oh, God, yes.

28:07.208 --> 28:09.083
Oh, ride 'em, cowboy.

28:09.166 --> 28:12.375
Oh, yes. God.

28:12.458 --> 28:14.542
Take me home, Philly.

28:14.625 --> 28:18.583
You should wear a saddle. Yes, yes!

28:18.667 --> 28:21.625
Stop it, Phil. I told you to beat it.
No means no.

28:24.458 --> 28:26.125
I need your car keys.

28:26.250 --> 28:28.291
You're blocking
the stallion's hatchback.

28:35.792 --> 28:39.291
Oh, yes. Yes, Phil.

28:39.542 --> 28:41.583
Fill me with Phil!

28:41.667 --> 28:44.875
- I never said that.
- And you moved the bed.

28:44.959 --> 28:46.792
- What were you thinking?
- Shut up.

28:46.875 --> 28:49.709
You know, if you're trying to hurt me,
that's not the way to do it.

28:49.792 --> 28:51.625
Well, then, enlighten me.

28:51.709 --> 28:54.458
How can I hit you so hard
that you will never recover?

28:56.625 --> 28:59.000
- You can't.
- No, I have to, Carlos.

28:59.083 --> 29:01.083
I need you to give up on us.

29:01.166 --> 29:04.417
We're not good for each other,
and I can't keep doing this.

29:05.250 --> 29:09.291
But I can.
You proved something tonight.

29:09.375 --> 29:11.500
You had a rich,
good-looking guy in your bed

29:11.583 --> 29:14.166
and you couldn't pull the trigger.

29:14.250 --> 29:16.000
That means you still care.

29:16.083 --> 29:17.125
And as long as I know that,

29:17.208 --> 29:20.208
I can take anything
that you can dish out.

29:23.959 --> 29:28.667
You know what? I'm tired.
Can we talk about this in the morning?

29:28.750 --> 29:29.875
Sure.

29:29.959 --> 29:32.875
But you're bringing me breakfast in bed
or no deal.

29:34.875 --> 29:36.375
It's a date.

29:53.208 --> 29:55.917
Sarah? What are you...

29:57.709 --> 30:01.125
Julie, thank God it's you.
We totally thought you were the cops.

30:01.208 --> 30:02.542
Oh, hey, Julie.

30:02.625 --> 30:05.542
What, are you
on buzz kill patrol tonight?

30:05.625 --> 30:07.875
This is why you couldn't go
to the movies with me?

30:07.959 --> 30:10.667
Sorry.
I thought you weren't that into him.

30:10.750 --> 30:12.000
- You know, if you are...
- I'm not!

30:12.083 --> 30:14.250
I'm just... I'm mad that you blew me off.

30:14.333 --> 30:17.792
Well, I would totally understand
if you wanted to blow me off for a date.

30:19.083 --> 30:21.583
You call this a date?
Getting mauled in a car?

30:21.667 --> 30:25.000
Hey, you want to talk about this later?
I'm losing altitude here.

30:26.458 --> 30:30.250
You are disgusting.
Enjoy the rest of your date.

30:34.166 --> 30:36.208
Julie, there you are.

30:36.291 --> 30:38.125
I think I found a way
to get through to Mike.

30:38.208 --> 30:40.417
Let it go. He's not into you.

30:45.250 --> 30:49.792
Gabby, rise and shine.
I made you some waffles.

30:54.750 --> 30:57.583
I got a second wind last night,
so I went to a bar.

30:57.667 --> 31:01.166
That's where I met Jason.
We spent the whole night...

31:01.250 --> 31:04.583
How did you put it? Pulling the trigger.

31:09.250 --> 31:11.917
So did I hurt you,
or should I keep trying?

31:21.750 --> 31:25.125
You kicked ass in rehab today.

31:25.208 --> 31:27.542
Yeah, I raised my arm over my head.

31:27.625 --> 31:30.417
- Sign me up for the Olympics.
- Oh, be patient.

31:30.500 --> 31:32.000
It takes time.

31:32.083 --> 31:34.959
Miss Britt, phone call for you
at the nurses' station.

31:35.041 --> 31:36.333
For me?

31:38.166 --> 31:39.875
I'll be right back.

31:45.375 --> 31:47.333
There's a phone call for me?

31:48.208 --> 31:49.750
Susan? What are you...

31:49.834 --> 31:51.834
I thought you could use some fresh air.

31:51.917 --> 31:53.375
Hello?

31:53.917 --> 31:55.709
Hello? It's Edie.

31:58.333 --> 31:59.917
What the hell is this? Who's he?

32:00.000 --> 32:01.083
Oh, this is Hank,

32:01.166 --> 32:04.375
and he has very kindly offered
to take us on a little field trip today.

32:04.458 --> 32:06.625
For 60 bucks an hour.

32:06.709 --> 32:10.333
- Where are you taking me?
- Just a little jaunt down memory lane.

32:11.166 --> 32:14.583
Oh, God. You're not taking me
to that fish and disco place, are you?

32:14.667 --> 32:17.417
No, no. What we're doing today
is a little more low-key.

32:17.500 --> 32:21.417
Don't worry. You're totally safe.
We're not doing anything wrong.

32:24.667 --> 32:26.041
Punch it!

32:32.417 --> 32:34.375
- Hello.
- Look, Mrs Hodge,

32:34.458 --> 32:37.041
I've only seen your daughter
once since the motel.

32:37.166 --> 32:40.291
- She told me that you'd backed off.
- Mr Faladi, I'm not here to threaten you.

32:40.375 --> 32:44.083
- I've come to give you my blessing.
- Your blessing?

32:44.166 --> 32:48.000
Yes, Danielle made it quite clear that
I'm powerless to stop this relationship.

32:48.083 --> 32:50.667
And since she assures me
that you love her...

32:50.750 --> 32:54.333
- You do love her, don't you?
- Yes, of course.

32:54.417 --> 32:57.166
Good. Then we're all set.

32:58.792 --> 33:00.250
Here's some of her clothes.

33:00.333 --> 33:03.667
I'll bring her CDs
and her stuffed animals over tomorrow.

33:03.750 --> 33:07.834
You want her to stay here?
This place is kind of small.

33:07.917 --> 33:11.917
Well, that hotel room was small
and you seemed happy enough there.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.041
Oh, and I trust you to be discreet.

33:14.125 --> 33:15.959
You wouldn't want your wife
to find out about this

33:16.041 --> 33:18.625
and use it against you in your divorce.

33:18.709 --> 33:21.667
Whoa, whoa, Mrs Hodge?

33:21.750 --> 33:24.333
Things are getting
a little bit complicated.

33:24.417 --> 33:27.709
Could you please tell Danielle
that this is not gonna work out?

33:27.792 --> 33:31.625
Mr Faladi, if you want to break
my daughter's heart, I can't stop you.

33:31.709 --> 33:34.917
But I will not be an accomplice.
You'll tell her yourself.

33:35.750 --> 33:37.041
Right.

33:37.125 --> 33:38.417
And don't even think
about blaming me.

33:38.500 --> 33:41.083
Because if you so much as mention
that we spoke,

33:41.166 --> 33:45.667
- I'll phone the police.
- Fine, I will leave you out of it.

33:49.166 --> 33:52.000
- Oh, and one more thing.
- Yes?

33:52.291 --> 33:54.709
Danielle is applying to colleges.

33:54.792 --> 33:58.542
I do hope she can count on you
for a glowing recommendation.

33:59.542 --> 34:00.875
Sure.

34:04.875 --> 34:06.875
And when I locked myself
out of the house,

34:06.959 --> 34:08.917
that's where the bush was
that you found me in.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.583
Naked. Surely, you remember that?

34:11.875 --> 34:15.834
- Nope.
- That hurts.

34:15.917 --> 34:18.417
Okay, remember this spot?

34:18.500 --> 34:21.583
This is where we sat in your truck
and had our first kiss.

34:22.583 --> 34:25.041
Were you naked then, too?

34:26.500 --> 34:28.625
Mike, why are you being this way?

34:29.458 --> 34:31.125
This is pointless.

34:31.417 --> 34:33.083
I'm sorry, I can't...

34:33.166 --> 34:37.166
- I don't remember being with you.
- Okay, I know it's hard,

34:37.250 --> 34:38.417
but you got to make an effort.

34:38.500 --> 34:41.000
And, you know, if your head is
a little foggy then don't look there.

34:41.083 --> 34:45.542
Look in your heart.
Because I'm in there.

34:45.625 --> 34:47.792
Just like you're inside mine.

34:49.709 --> 34:53.709
Okay, this is Mary Alice's house.

34:53.792 --> 34:55.917
And this is where we first met.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.709
I was setting out
my macaroni and cheese.

34:58.792 --> 35:00.667
And you were in line...

35:02.041 --> 35:05.542
I'm good. Finally, a smile.

35:05.625 --> 35:07.291
You do that a lot, don't you?

35:07.375 --> 35:09.625
Well, yeah, I've been known
to take a spill or two.

35:09.709 --> 35:11.625
But, you know,
my doctor says it's an inner ear...

35:13.375 --> 35:17.333
- Wait. You remember that?
- Yeah, I think I do.

35:17.417 --> 35:20.208
Yes! That's progress. See?

35:20.291 --> 35:23.500
It's all gonna come back.
We're gonna be us again.

35:23.625 --> 35:26.750
But what about the British guy?

35:31.583 --> 35:34.458
Mike, I don't know
what Edie's been telling you,

35:34.542 --> 35:36.750
but Ian and I, we're just friends.

35:37.625 --> 35:40.125
- Just friends?
- Yeah.

35:41.291 --> 35:42.709
Now.

35:46.959 --> 35:49.750
Look, you got to understand.

35:49.834 --> 35:53.875
The doctors were telling me that
you would probably never wake up.

35:54.125 --> 35:56.667
And I just needed somebody to talk to.

35:57.417 --> 36:00.625
And that's what you were doing
in the country, talking?

36:05.458 --> 36:07.750
Mr Delfino, are you okay?

36:10.625 --> 36:11.667
I'm fine.

36:11.750 --> 36:14.458
You can't just discharge a patient
without permission!

36:14.542 --> 36:17.333
I was just trying to help him remember.
And tell her, Mike.

36:17.417 --> 36:19.291
We were making progress!

36:20.917 --> 36:23.417
Take me back to the hospital.

36:29.750 --> 36:30.792
Mike!

36:31.041 --> 36:35.500
Well, at the risk of stating
the obvious, it's over.

36:35.583 --> 36:37.792
- He's mine now.
- No, no, no, no. No, no!

36:37.875 --> 36:41.750
This is not how this ends.
No, evil does not triumph over good.

36:41.834 --> 36:43.458
That's how you see me?

36:43.542 --> 36:46.417
Damn straight.
You lie, you cheat, you scheme.

36:46.500 --> 36:50.333
You ruin people's relationships.
I mean, how do you sleep at night?

36:50.417 --> 36:54.875
Soon, with Mike on top of me.
If you know what I mean.

36:55.500 --> 36:57.792
See? Evil. Evil.

36:57.875 --> 36:59.709
Has it ever occurred to you

36:59.792 --> 37:02.458
that maybe Mike and I are meant
to end up together?

37:05.208 --> 37:08.417
No! Mike... You don't even want him.

37:08.500 --> 37:11.542
You're just doing this to hurt me.

37:11.625 --> 37:14.750
Wow. How self-absorbed can you be?

37:14.834 --> 37:18.166
I have had a thing for Mike
since the day he moved in here.

37:18.250 --> 37:21.125
And I even backed off when he fell
for your little Miss Adorable act.

37:21.208 --> 37:23.417
But he's over that. It's my turn now.

37:23.500 --> 37:26.041
And I will be better for him
than you ever were.

37:26.834 --> 37:30.458
And if you do get hurt,
well, that's just gravy.

37:33.667 --> 37:37.750
All right. Maybe that was a little evil.

37:52.333 --> 37:54.583
- Finally.
- Sorry it took so long.

37:54.667 --> 37:57.208
That last digit was barely legible.

37:57.291 --> 37:59.500
I thought you'd like to do the honours.

38:12.417 --> 38:14.458
<i>You've reached</i>
<i>Mike Delfino Plumbing.</i>

38:14.542 --> 38:16.917
<i>Please leave a message</i>
<i>after the beep.</i>

38:30.917 --> 38:32.834
Whoa, a D minus.

38:32.917 --> 38:35.041
- That blows.
- Yeah, it does.

38:35.125 --> 38:37.083
Especially since it's not the one
we did together.

38:37.166 --> 38:39.250
You e-mailed me the wrong paper.

38:39.333 --> 38:41.166
You didn't even read it
before you turned it in?

38:41.250 --> 38:42.417
I didn't think I had to.

38:42.500 --> 38:43.917
The one you wrote that night was great.

38:44.000 --> 38:47.500
Well, after you left, I decided
I really should put it in your words.

38:50.125 --> 38:52.917
Is this some weird chick thing you did
'cause you're into me?

38:53.000 --> 38:54.542
Oh, please.

38:55.041 --> 38:58.208
No, no, no, it is. You're pissed
'cause I hooked up with your friend.

38:58.291 --> 39:00.125
No, I'm pissed
because you told me some sob story

39:00.208 --> 39:02.375
so I'd write your paper for you.

39:02.458 --> 39:07.583
- Now you owe me 15 bucks.
- You know what? Here.

39:10.333 --> 39:12.709
Oh, and I did learn something.

39:12.792 --> 39:15.750
Iago betrayed Othello
because he was jealous.

39:24.083 --> 39:26.375
Danielle, I thought you'd
be with Mr Faladi tonight.

39:26.458 --> 39:28.458
You'll be happy to know
he dumped me.

39:28.750 --> 39:31.000
- He dumped you?
- Said it was getting too messy,

39:31.083 --> 39:34.250
that I was gonna complicate
his divorce.

39:35.291 --> 39:38.333
- Don't pretend you're sorry.
- I don't plan to.

39:38.417 --> 39:40.875
I hope this doesn't make history class
too awkward.

39:41.125 --> 39:42.792
You don't have to worry about that.

39:42.875 --> 39:44.792
I went to the principal
and got his ass fired.

39:44.875 --> 39:47.125
And then when he called to yell at me
for squealing on him,

39:47.208 --> 39:50.667
I recorded the call
and sent a tape of it to his wife.

39:50.750 --> 39:53.834
Thanks to me he'll be getting nothing
in this divorce.

39:57.917 --> 39:59.625
I must say,
that was rather under-handed.

39:59.709 --> 40:03.417
Yes. I wonder where she gets it.

40:07.083 --> 40:08.500
- Bye, Daddy.
- All right, chipmunk.

40:08.583 --> 40:11.125
I'll see you guys next Friday. Okay?

40:11.208 --> 40:14.667
Kayla said that you're opening
a pizza place?

40:14.750 --> 40:17.959
Well, maybe.
I mean, it's not a done deal yet.

40:19.500 --> 40:21.875
Lynette put the kibosh on it, huh?

40:22.667 --> 40:24.333
What makes you say that?

40:24.417 --> 40:27.417
Well, you know. Lynette.

40:28.875 --> 40:30.625
She's probably right. I mean,

40:30.709 --> 40:33.166
there's a bunch of dumb schmucks
out there trying to open restaurants.

40:33.250 --> 40:35.834
You know, Tom, I've tasted your pizza.

40:35.917 --> 40:38.166
And I have to be perfectly honest
with you.

40:39.417 --> 40:42.625
It was like I died and went to Italy.

40:44.291 --> 40:46.458
- Really?
- Oh, my God!

40:46.542 --> 40:47.792
You are born to do this.

40:47.875 --> 40:50.417
And I just hate to see you give it up,
because, well...

40:52.834 --> 40:58.125
Man, this is none of my business.
But Lynette does

40:58.208 --> 41:01.000
bully you sometimes.

41:01.625 --> 41:02.709
She doesn't mean to.

41:02.792 --> 41:05.041
Then don't let her.
You go to the mat on this one.

41:05.125 --> 41:09.208
She will respect you a lot more
if you grew a pair.

41:10.125 --> 41:12.041
I'm not trying to insult you.

41:13.250 --> 41:16.208
All I'm saying is that

41:18.333 --> 41:20.500
I know what you're capable of.

41:22.083 --> 41:24.083
And I believe in you.

41:26.208 --> 41:28.542
I really needed to hear that.

41:31.500 --> 41:32.542
Thanks.

41:40.333 --> 41:44.125
<i>Sabotage. Everyone is capable of it.</i>

41:44.208 --> 41:48.375
<i>But some go about it</i>
<i>more ruthlessly than others.</i>

41:50.208 --> 41:52.875
<i>Like the ones who crave vengeance.</i>

41:55.625 --> 41:58.583
<i>Or the ones who hunger for love.</i>

42:01.000 --> 42:04.291
<i>Or the ones who are determined</i>
<i>to burn bridges.</i>

42:06.458 --> 42:09.917
<i>And then there are those</i>
<i>who simply want something.</i>

42:10.000 --> 42:13.083
I wish Daddy lived here
so he could tuck me in, too.

42:13.166 --> 42:16.625
<i>Something that belongs</i>
<i>to someone else.</i>

42:16.709 --> 42:18.709
I'm working on it, piglet.

42:22.291 --> 42:24.000
Mama's working on it.
