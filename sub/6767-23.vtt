WEBVTT

00:05.588 --> 00:07.757
(sighs)

00:07.841 --> 00:09.300
Morning.

00:09.384 --> 00:10.552
{\an1}Morning.

00:10.635 --> 00:11.761
You slept in.

00:11.845 --> 00:14.097
I'm just tossing
and turning all night.

00:14.180 --> 00:17.267
I haven't had a good night's
sleep since Joey left.

00:17.350 --> 00:18.184
Oh, he'll turn up.

00:18.268 --> 00:20.520
I thought
you were sleeping at Steve's.

00:20.603 --> 00:22.147
That was the plan.

00:22.230 --> 00:23.648
What happened?

00:23.732 --> 00:26.609
Oh, nothing out
of the ordinary.

00:26.693 --> 00:28.486
I don't know.
Maybe Steve's right.

00:28.570 --> 00:30.989
Maybe I am the one
with the hormone imbalance.

00:31.072 --> 00:33.658
Otherwise, why would I keep
trying to change

00:33.742 --> 00:35.410
{\an3}what obviously
cannot be changed?

00:35.493 --> 00:36.411
(scoffs)

00:36.494 --> 00:37.787
Are things really that bad?

00:37.871 --> 00:39.164
{\an1}He's just

00:39.247 --> 00:41.416
so insensitive, you know?

00:41.499 --> 00:42.625
About what?
Everything.

00:42.709 --> 00:44.085
Sex.

00:44.169 --> 00:46.087
Last night,
he actually demanded his quota.

00:46.171 --> 00:47.464
{\an3}Well, boys

00:47.547 --> 00:48.923
{\an1}will be boys.
Yeah.

00:49.007 --> 00:50.633
{\an1}Did you talk to him?
Yeah.

00:50.717 --> 00:51.968
He pouted.

00:52.051 --> 00:53.219
I hate that.

00:53.303 --> 00:54.929
{\an1}He didn't say anything?
Oh, yeah, he did.

00:55.013 --> 00:56.222
Here's a quote.

00:56.306 --> 00:57.974
"Gee, Clare, what's wrong?

00:58.057 --> 00:59.976
Is it puffy, mean
and snappy time?"

01:00.059 --> 01:01.311
It's KEG-speak

01:01.394 --> 01:02.312
{\an1}for PMS.

01:02.395 --> 01:03.271
That's low.

01:03.354 --> 01:04.313
{\an1}Well, maybe
it's time

01:04.397 --> 01:06.483
I sink to his level.

01:06.566 --> 01:09.360
I think I know how to do it.

01:10.945 --> 01:12.989
Clare...

01:16.409 --> 01:18.828
{\an3}I gotta go; I'm gonna
be late for class.

01:18.912 --> 01:20.330
{\an6}Okay.
Thanks for
letting me vent.

01:20.413 --> 01:21.790
Be good.

01:21.873 --> 01:23.792
I will.

01:23.875 --> 01:25.919
Hello.

01:29.547 --> 01:31.299
Joey?

01:31.382 --> 01:32.467
{\an3}Hi.

01:32.550 --> 01:34.636
{\an1}Oh, my God, I've been
worried about you.

01:34.719 --> 01:36.221
Are you okay?

01:36.304 --> 01:38.223
I couldn't stay
at that stupid shelter.

01:38.306 --> 01:41.017
You don't have to; it's....
I'm not going back there.

01:41.100 --> 01:43.186
{\an3}Please, you can't
send me back there.

01:43.269 --> 01:44.604
You've got to promise.

01:44.687 --> 01:46.147
Okay, okay, I promise.

01:46.231 --> 01:48.233
Come here. It's okay.

03:52.982 --> 03:54.984
Coffee on?

03:55.944 --> 03:57.362
Look at her.

03:57.445 --> 03:58.821
How does she do it?

03:58.905 --> 03:59.906
School all morning;

03:59.989 --> 04:02.867
{\an1}afternoons with her boyfriend
Rob; clubbing all night.

04:02.951 --> 04:05.119
{\an1}And look at her
first thing in the morning--

04:05.203 --> 04:07.121
a vision in terrycloth.

04:07.205 --> 04:09.123
{\an3}Utterly in vogue.
Ha, ha, ha.

04:09.207 --> 04:11.334
{\an3}What are you doing?
E-mail?

04:11.417 --> 04:13.503
{\an1}Yes, yes, I was doing
a little e-mail

04:13.586 --> 04:15.004
{\an1}with Jim and Cindy
in Hong Kong.

04:15.088 --> 04:17.005
They want me to come
and visit them for spring break.

04:17.089 --> 04:18.341
Oh, that's great.
Yeah.

04:18.423 --> 04:19.550
They're sending two tickets.

04:19.634 --> 04:21.010
{\an1}From the contents
of that letter, it appears

04:21.094 --> 04:22.136
{\an1}they're not gonna
take no for an answer.

04:22.220 --> 04:23.638
Well, you could take me.

04:23.721 --> 04:25.014
{\an1}Take you?

04:25.098 --> 04:25.974
To Hong Kong? Really?

04:26.057 --> 04:27.225
Are you sure you want

04:27.308 --> 04:29.519
{\an1}to leave Rob here alone
in the naked city?

04:29.602 --> 04:31.312
{\an1}At the mercy
of the paparazzi,

04:31.396 --> 04:35.024
in front of the teaming hordes
of women that can't wait to get

04:35.108 --> 04:36.567
{\an1}up-close and personal
with Hollywood's

04:36.651 --> 04:38.194
hottest young rising star, hmm?

04:38.277 --> 04:39.362
You're right.

04:39.445 --> 04:40.947
{\an3}Yeah, thanks for
offering, but you know,

04:41.030 --> 04:43.366
{\an3}I really can't go with
you to Hong Kong, Brandon.

04:43.449 --> 04:45.201
{\an3}You know, when me and
Rob have... have plans.

04:45.284 --> 04:46.703
I thought so.

04:46.786 --> 04:48.830
Besides, you'll
be taking Tracy.

04:51.624 --> 04:53.751
(sighs)

04:55.795 --> 04:59.007
{\an5}WEATHERMAN:
That unusually severe,
unseasonable tropical depression

04:59.090 --> 05:01.551
is now pounding the coast
of Baja this morning...

05:01.634 --> 05:03.344
Here you go, more cereal.

05:05.805 --> 05:08.558
{\an1}Whoa, check out
those waves.

05:08.641 --> 05:11.352
Gotta be lippin' out
at ten feet at least.

05:11.436 --> 05:12.937
{\an1}You know,
if you catch 'em right,

05:13.021 --> 05:15.940
{\an1}you can rip on those suckers
for miles and miles.

05:16.941 --> 05:21.571
Okay, why don't we drop
the surfer lingo

05:21.654 --> 05:24.615
and talk about you, okay?

05:24.699 --> 05:27.035
{\an1}All right,
I want to know why

05:27.118 --> 05:28.244
you ran away from home.

05:28.327 --> 05:30.079
And don't even think
about lying to me.

05:30.163 --> 05:32.874
{\an1}Come on.
You can trust me.

05:32.957 --> 05:34.917
Why don't you start
by telling me your full name.

05:35.001 --> 05:36.794
Joey Evers.

05:36.878 --> 05:39.547
Nice to meet you, Joey Evers.

05:39.630 --> 05:41.299
Where are you from?

05:41.382 --> 05:42.759
New Mexico.

05:42.842 --> 05:44.427
Santa Fe.

05:44.510 --> 05:45.636
{\an1}Nice town.

05:45.720 --> 05:47.138
Why'd you leave?

05:47.221 --> 05:48.639
My mom.

05:48.723 --> 05:50.808
She married this jerk Ernie.

05:50.892 --> 05:52.268
{\an3}Ernie who?
Ernie Merrick.

05:52.351 --> 05:53.269
He hates me.

05:53.352 --> 05:54.896
{\an1}How do you know
he hates you?

05:54.979 --> 05:57.148
You said before, he never
hurt you, so how do you--

05:57.231 --> 05:58.524
He just does, okay?

05:58.608 --> 06:01.611
Now, my mom, she's
gonna have a baby.

06:01.694 --> 06:03.488
They're gonna have their own
little family, and then...

06:03.571 --> 06:05.740
so they don't need me anymore.

06:09.410 --> 06:12.288
Do you think you could be
reading any of this wrong?

06:12.371 --> 06:14.165
{\an3}No, I know.

06:14.248 --> 06:16.084
You don't even know 'em.

06:16.167 --> 06:19.837
No, I don't,

06:19.921 --> 06:21.339
but I know what it's like

06:21.422 --> 06:24.092
{\an1}to have to deal
with a new stepdad.

06:24.175 --> 06:27.845
{\an1}And it's not fun watching
your mom get caught up

06:27.929 --> 06:29.472
in a whole new life.

06:29.555 --> 06:31.641
{\an1}But that doesn't mean
that you're not included.

06:31.724 --> 06:35.436
{\an3}Then why haven't they
found me yet, huh?

06:35.520 --> 06:37.146
I'll tell you why.

06:37.230 --> 06:38.481
{\an3}It's because they're
glad I left.

06:38.564 --> 06:40.650
They don't even care.

06:40.733 --> 06:41.734
Come here.

06:49.075 --> 06:50.660
(gasps, laughs)
David!?

06:50.743 --> 06:52.161
{\an1}Mwah! Hey.

06:52.245 --> 06:54.163
{\an3}Mm, what did you have
for breakfast?

06:54.247 --> 06:56.124
{\an1}What? What?
Can't a guy in love

06:56.207 --> 06:57.667
just revel in it
once in a while?

06:57.750 --> 06:59.877
{\an3}Yeah, sure.
What're you up to?

06:59.961 --> 07:02.171
{\an1}Excuse me.
There's no agenda.

07:02.255 --> 07:04.382
{\an1}I just, you know,
I woke up this morning,

07:04.465 --> 07:06.634
and that story that your
grandmother told us just,

07:06.717 --> 07:07.677
it's been running
through my head.

07:07.760 --> 07:08.678
And I got to thinking,

07:08.761 --> 07:10.555
if love can conquer all,

07:10.638 --> 07:14.016
{\an1}maybe it can conquer this
resentment I've been feeling.

07:14.100 --> 07:15.852
{\an3}Resentment?

07:15.935 --> 07:18.521
{\an1}Well, you know,
with your parents and...

07:18.604 --> 07:19.730
David, please?

07:19.814 --> 07:21.691
{\an1}Nah, Donna, I want 'em
to see me for me,

07:21.774 --> 07:22.692
you know what I'm saying?

07:22.775 --> 07:25.486
I want 'em to see
who I really am.

07:25.570 --> 07:26.696
{\an1}And I don't know,
I think I just need

07:26.779 --> 07:27.822
to find a new way
of communicating,

07:27.905 --> 07:30.533
especially with Felice.

07:30.616 --> 07:33.202
{\an1}Maybe it's time
to write a new chapter.

07:33.286 --> 07:35.037
So you do have an agenda.

07:35.121 --> 07:37.373
{\an3}Well, I guess I'm glad
my mom is still on

07:37.456 --> 07:39.000
{\an3}that cruise with
my Aunt Ann.

07:39.083 --> 07:40.042
{\an1}Well, thanks
for the support.

07:40.126 --> 07:42.837
No, David, I love you.

07:42.920 --> 07:45.339
{\an3}And I am perfectly willing
to love you,

07:45.423 --> 07:46.716
{\an3}whether or not
they accept you.

07:46.799 --> 07:47.717
I know, I know that.

07:47.800 --> 07:48.718
And you know what?

07:48.801 --> 07:50.553
Why stir things up?

07:50.636 --> 07:52.096
Just let it be, okay?

07:52.180 --> 07:54.765
Okay.

07:54.849 --> 07:56.225
{\an3}BRANDON:
Hey, get a room, kids.

07:56.309 --> 07:57.727
Hey, Sanders.

07:57.810 --> 07:59.228
{\an5}Hey, bud,
how you doin'?
Good, how're you?

07:59.312 --> 08:01.230
{\an3}I'm all right, but my
old man is freaking out.

08:01.314 --> 08:03.566
{\an6}He's worried about this
storm that's blowing
up here from Mexico.

08:03.649 --> 08:06.360
Why? Most of 'em never make it
all the way up to L.A.

08:06.444 --> 08:08.696
{\an3}Well, I told him that,
but he jumped all over me.

08:08.779 --> 08:09.572
See, he's stuck in Seattle.

08:09.655 --> 08:10.740
He just bought this house
in Malibu.

08:10.823 --> 08:13.284
I'm listening.
Coffee, please.

08:13.367 --> 08:14.577
Well, he wants me
to take care of it

08:14.660 --> 08:15.912
until the storm blows over.

08:15.995 --> 08:17.455
But I'm gonna do something
better than that.

08:17.538 --> 08:18.581
I'm gonna head up there
this afternoon

08:18.664 --> 08:19.957
{\an3}and I'm gonna sandbag
that sucker.

08:20.041 --> 08:21.626
Like the good son you are.
Coffee?

08:21.709 --> 08:22.627
No, thank you.

08:22.710 --> 08:24.587
Anyway, I'm enlisting the help
of my friends.

08:24.670 --> 08:26.088
I want you to spread the word,
okay?

08:26.172 --> 08:27.548
I'll draw you a map.

08:27.632 --> 08:28.966
{\an1}Okay.

08:29.050 --> 08:31.052
Listen, Steve, can I,
uh, can I talk to you

08:31.135 --> 08:32.053
about something private?

08:32.135 --> 08:33.971
Private?

08:34.054 --> 08:35.514
I love private.

08:35.597 --> 08:36.640
Copy that.

08:36.724 --> 08:37.642
{\an1}Listen,

08:37.725 --> 08:38.643
I might be going

08:38.726 --> 08:39.559
to Hong Kong over break.

08:39.644 --> 08:40.977
My parents are sending me
two tickets.

08:41.062 --> 08:42.104
Two tickets?

08:42.188 --> 08:44.565
{\an3}Oh, Bran, you gotta take me,
please, please, please.

08:44.649 --> 08:45.983
I need a break from
her Royal Highness.

08:46.067 --> 08:47.401
{\an3}Do you?
I do.

08:47.485 --> 08:50.154
I love Clare, but look at me,
checking my watch

08:50.238 --> 08:51.572
{\an3}for the umpteenth time.
Why?

08:51.656 --> 08:52.573
Why? Why you ask?

08:52.657 --> 08:54.116
Yes, "Why?" I ask.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.952
Well, she's expecting me
over at the Peach Pit right now

08:56.035 --> 08:57.453
for another one of those
little joyous talks.

08:57.536 --> 08:59.080
(groaning)
What is it about women?

08:59.163 --> 09:01.123
All they want to do is talk,
not about sports,

09:01.207 --> 09:02.625
but about their feelings.

09:02.708 --> 09:04.502
And then they want to talk
to you about your feel--

09:04.585 --> 09:05.544
Hey, guys.

09:05.628 --> 09:06.629
{\an3}Hey, Tracy,
how you doing?

09:06.712 --> 09:08.339
I feel good.

09:08.422 --> 09:09.632
Hm! Need I say more?

09:09.715 --> 09:11.133
{\an3}Seldom wrong
and right again.

09:11.217 --> 09:12.468
Thank you, sir.
Bye, Bran.

09:12.551 --> 09:13.427
{\an1}Chin chin.

09:13.511 --> 09:14.428
{\an3}Bye, Tracy.
Bye.

09:14.512 --> 09:15.972
What was that all about?

09:16.055 --> 09:17.640
{\an1}Nothing, nothing,
nothing at all.

09:19.100 --> 09:20.476
{\an1}Steve, uh,
Steve needs some help

09:20.559 --> 09:22.979
{\an1}sandbagging his father's house
in Malibu this afternoon.

09:23.062 --> 09:24.313
Can I count you in?

09:24.397 --> 09:25.940
{\an3}Sure.
Great.

09:26.023 --> 09:27.525
{\an3}Listen, I was thinking
about going home

09:27.608 --> 09:29.318
to visit my parents
over spring break,

09:29.402 --> 09:31.779
{\an3}and I thought maybe you could
come with me and meet them.

09:31.862 --> 09:33.322
I don't think I could do that.

09:33.406 --> 09:36.325
{\an1}My parents want me
to visit them in Hong Kong.

09:36.409 --> 09:37.326
{\an3}Really!

09:37.410 --> 09:39.328
{\an1}Yeah.
Well...

09:39.412 --> 09:40.997
{\an1}But don't let
that hold you up.

09:41.080 --> 09:42.832
{\an1}You should go up
to the ranch.

09:42.915 --> 09:44.333
Yeah.

09:44.417 --> 09:45.501
I'll miss you, though.

09:45.584 --> 09:47.336
I'll miss you, too.

09:47.420 --> 09:50.047
All right, I gotta
go to the library.

09:50.131 --> 09:52.550
I'll see you later.

10:01.309 --> 10:02.351
Knock, knock.

10:02.435 --> 10:04.478
Valerie, hi.

10:04.562 --> 10:05.646
Hi.

10:05.730 --> 10:08.524
I'm sorry I didn't call,
but you don't have a phone yet.

10:08.607 --> 10:12.236
You don't have a phone
or a couch or a bed,

10:12.320 --> 10:15.323
{\an1}but you sure do have
a lot of tools.

10:15.406 --> 10:17.366
You want to hand me that planer?
Yeah.

10:17.450 --> 10:18.743
{\an3}Thanks.

10:20.828 --> 10:22.330
{\an3}You know...

10:22.413 --> 10:24.540
I been working with wood
since I was about five.

10:24.623 --> 10:27.543
{\an3}I've been working in film
for what, about five minutes?

10:27.626 --> 10:28.586
{\an1}So what?
You're a natural.

10:28.669 --> 10:29.920
Nah, Val.

10:30.004 --> 10:32.381
Didn't you hear my manager?

10:32.465 --> 10:34.717
"Don't worry about the acting,
man; you're a star."

10:34.800 --> 10:36.719
And what's a star?

10:36.802 --> 10:39.597
Nothin' but a big ball of gas.

10:40.931 --> 10:42.725
Do you know how many people

10:42.808 --> 10:44.352
would kill to be in your shoes?

10:45.353 --> 10:47.063
Do you know how lucky you are?

10:47.146 --> 10:48.773
Yeah, I do.

10:48.856 --> 10:51.192
It scares the hell out of me.

10:51.275 --> 10:52.860
Well, you should enjoy it.

10:52.943 --> 10:55.071
I'll say this:

10:55.154 --> 10:57.031
I'm enjoying you.

10:57.114 --> 11:00.868
Well, I'm glad you said that.

11:00.951 --> 11:02.244
Can I ask you a favor?

11:02.328 --> 11:03.496
{\an1}Of course.

11:06.415 --> 11:08.250
Would you read this script,

11:08.334 --> 11:13.214
{\an3}tell me if maybe it
should be my next movie?

11:13.297 --> 11:14.298
I'd love to.

11:19.470 --> 11:20.388
Hey, Steve.

11:20.471 --> 11:21.389
{\an3}Hi, Nat.

11:21.472 --> 11:23.224
Is Clare all right?

11:23.307 --> 11:24.266
Yeah, why?

11:24.350 --> 11:25.601
Well, when was
the last time

11:25.684 --> 11:27.144
{\an1}you saw her order
a double-megaburger

11:27.228 --> 11:29.730
{\an1}with extra cheese
and fries?

11:29.814 --> 11:30.940
Never.

11:31.023 --> 11:32.233
{\an1}(wry chuckle)
Uh-huh.

11:32.316 --> 11:34.068
Clare!

11:36.153 --> 11:38.280
Hmph! Useless bozo.

11:38.364 --> 11:40.116
It's nice to see you too.

11:40.199 --> 11:41.450
Hmm?

11:41.534 --> 11:43.619
Oh, no, no, not you--
Rodman.

11:43.702 --> 11:45.579
{\an1}How much are they paying
this guy, anyway?

11:45.663 --> 11:47.456
Ten million or so. Why?

11:47.540 --> 11:48.457
Ten million?!

11:48.541 --> 11:50.626
I'm in the wrong major.

11:50.709 --> 11:52.962
I think
you're in the wrong body.

11:53.045 --> 11:55.172
So, uh, Clare,
you wanted to talk

11:55.256 --> 11:57.133
{\an6}to me about
something?
I did?

11:58.092 --> 11:59.135
Oh, yeah.

11:59.218 --> 12:00.428
I just wanted to apologize.

12:00.511 --> 12:02.138
For what?

12:02.221 --> 12:03.222
For all my whining,
negativity...

12:03.305 --> 12:05.766
I don't know how you've put up
with me this long.

12:05.850 --> 12:07.476
{\an1}I just wanted you
to know

12:07.560 --> 12:09.019
I've done something about it.

12:09.103 --> 12:10.646
{\an1}I volunteered for
this upper division

12:10.729 --> 12:11.981
science project.

12:12.064 --> 12:12.982
{\an3}Oh, great.

12:13.065 --> 12:14.984
Yeah. See this?

12:15.067 --> 12:17.111
{\an1}It's a transdermal
delivery system.

12:18.237 --> 12:19.530
Cool.
What's it delivering?

12:19.613 --> 12:21.115
(deep voice):
Testosterone.

12:21.198 --> 12:23.159
Testosterone?!

12:23.242 --> 12:25.327
Clare, you know
that's a male hormone, right?

12:25.411 --> 12:28.164
Women have mild levels
of it, too.

12:28.247 --> 12:30.166
I've just been way

12:30.249 --> 12:32.209
over the top lately,
way too emotional.

12:32.293 --> 12:35.004
And I thought-- add a little
"male" to the mix,

12:35.087 --> 12:36.505
{\an1}might balance
the scales.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.799
I don't think that's a good...
(belches)

12:38.883 --> 12:40.301
Oh, geez! Come on.
Let's hit the beach.

12:40.384 --> 12:41.719
We're losing daylight.

12:41.802 --> 12:43.554
{\an1}We've gotta do
some sandbagging.

12:46.098 --> 12:48.809
No, you are showing
great improvement,

12:48.893 --> 12:50.853
{\an3}which is why I reduced
the medication.

12:50.936 --> 12:52.688
{\an3}Now, I want you
to call me

12:52.771 --> 12:54.398
{\an3}if there's any problem
at all, all right?

12:54.482 --> 12:56.984
You call.

12:57.067 --> 12:57.860
{\an3}Excuse me.

12:57.943 --> 12:59.403
{\an3}Dr. Martin?

13:01.113 --> 13:02.740
{\an6}David!
Hey. How are
you doing, sir?

13:02.823 --> 13:05.201
Hi. I wasn't expecting you.

13:05.284 --> 13:07.244
Is Donna all right?

13:07.328 --> 13:08.496
{\an3}No, no, no,
she-she's fine.

13:08.579 --> 13:10.706
{\an3}I was just, um,
I was in the area

13:10.789 --> 13:12.541
{\an3}and I thought I'd stop by
and say hello.

13:12.625 --> 13:13.709
Good. I'm glad you did.

13:13.792 --> 13:16.170
{\an5}You look really busy.
I can come back.
No, nonsense.

13:16.253 --> 13:17.713
I've always got
a minute for you.

13:17.796 --> 13:18.839
Come on inside. Come on.

13:18.923 --> 13:19.965
Great. Thanks.

13:22.593 --> 13:26.555
Here... (sighs)

13:26.639 --> 13:28.516
Sit right there.

13:28.599 --> 13:30.392
I-I really appreciate
you taking the time.

13:30.476 --> 13:32.061
{\an3}Oh, I just wish
I had more.

13:32.144 --> 13:34.063
I'm out a partner today

13:34.146 --> 13:37.775
{\an3}and I tell you, the patients,
they just keep on coming.

13:37.858 --> 13:41.362
{\an1}So... what can I do
for you?

13:43.781 --> 13:46.742
Well...

13:46.825 --> 13:49.203
{\an3}I could, I could
really use some advice.

13:49.286 --> 13:50.746
{\an6}Advice?
Well, matters
of the heart

13:50.829 --> 13:52.248
are your specialty,
aren't they?

13:54.542 --> 13:56.710
Are you and Donna
having problems?

13:56.794 --> 13:57.795
No, no, no.

13:57.878 --> 14:00.923
Uh, actually, things, things
have never been better.

14:03.008 --> 14:06.929
Look, to be honest with you,

14:07.012 --> 14:12.184
{\an5}(stammering):
it's you and Mrs. Martin
I'm a little concerned about.

14:12.268 --> 14:16.063
{\an6}Donna asked me
just to let it be,
but I-I can't.

14:16.146 --> 14:18.148
I-I feel like,

14:18.232 --> 14:22.278
like Mrs. Martin is trying
to sever this,

14:22.361 --> 14:26.031
this connection
that Donna and I have, and...

14:26.115 --> 14:29.118
I... I would do anything
to-to change that.

14:29.201 --> 14:32.454
I understand.

14:32.538 --> 14:35.416
You know, my advice
to you would be...

14:35.499 --> 14:36.792
just be yourself.

14:36.875 --> 14:39.169
{\an1}She'll just grow weary
of her outlook,

14:39.253 --> 14:40.462
and things will get...

14:40.546 --> 14:43.090
things will get a lot better,
believe me.

14:43.173 --> 14:46.302
{\an3}Man, that's
great to hear.

14:46.385 --> 14:48.470
{\an3}Dr. Martin, I love your
daughter and it's...

14:48.554 --> 14:52.474
I hope, in the future,
when it comes time...

14:52.558 --> 14:53.851
{\an1}Dr. Martin?
(gasps)

14:55.394 --> 14:57.813
{\an3}(groans)

14:57.896 --> 14:59.815
Dr. Martin!

14:59.898 --> 15:00.899
{\an1}Doc...!

15:02.359 --> 15:04.361
Nurse! Nurse!

15:04.445 --> 15:05.487
{\an1}Nurse, get in here,
please!

15:05.571 --> 15:06.780
{\an1}There's something wrong
with Dr. Martin!

15:06.864 --> 15:08.157
Dr. Martin!

15:08.240 --> 15:10.743
{\an3}I don't know what happened!
He just collapsed!

15:10.826 --> 15:13.370
(keypad beeping)

15:14.872 --> 15:16.248
(phone rings)

15:22.921 --> 15:24.882
Hello?

15:24.965 --> 15:26.800
Yeah, this is Donna Martin.

15:30.721 --> 15:32.431
My father what?

15:34.725 --> 15:36.810
In critical...?

15:36.894 --> 15:38.646
Oh, my God...

15:48.489 --> 15:51.867
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Dr. Baker, Neurology.

15:51.950 --> 15:53.202
Excuse me.
Hi, I'm Donna Martin.

15:53.285 --> 15:54.495
{\an1}I'm here
to see my father.

15:54.578 --> 15:57.665
{\an6}Doctor?
Oh, Donna, I tried to get
ahold of your mother.

15:57.748 --> 15:58.707
She's on a trip.

15:58.791 --> 15:59.667
{\an1}Dr. Abrams,
where's my father?

15:59.750 --> 16:00.709
He's just down the hall.

16:00.793 --> 16:02.002
I want to see him.

16:02.086 --> 16:03.545
{\an3}You can't.
Not now.

16:03.629 --> 16:05.089
We're trying
to get him stabilized.

16:05.172 --> 16:07.341
Your father had a major stroke.

16:07.424 --> 16:09.551
{\an3}A blocked blood vessel on
the left side of the brain.

16:09.635 --> 16:11.261
Right now he's just fighting
to hang on.

16:11.345 --> 16:12.554
Oh, God.

16:12.638 --> 16:14.932
The next 24 hours will be
very critical.

16:15.015 --> 16:18.894
The good news is they
brought him in quickly enough

16:18.977 --> 16:20.896
that we were able
to administer tPA

16:20.979 --> 16:22.189
It's a clot-reducing agent

16:22.272 --> 16:23.440
which we hope
will minimize

16:23.524 --> 16:24.608
{\an3}any chance
of brain damage.

16:24.692 --> 16:27.069
What can I do?

16:27.152 --> 16:29.571
Just say a prayer.
Hold a good thought.

16:29.655 --> 16:30.572
I'll check back

16:30.656 --> 16:32.408
{\an3}with you in a little
bit, okay?

16:32.491 --> 16:33.492
Thanks.

16:39.289 --> 16:40.749
{\an3}Donna?

16:40.833 --> 16:44.253
David!

16:44.336 --> 16:45.587
What're you doing here?

16:45.671 --> 16:47.715
I was with your dad
when it happened.

16:47.798 --> 16:49.591
{\an1}You were?

16:49.675 --> 16:51.969
Yeah, I went into his office.

16:52.052 --> 16:54.096
I don't understand. Why?

16:54.179 --> 16:56.432
We were, we were just talking.

16:56.515 --> 16:59.893
David, I gotta,
I gotta call my mom, okay?

17:05.148 --> 17:06.608
{\an5}WOMAN:
Hi, you've reached
the Merrick residence.

17:06.692 --> 17:08.402
Please leave your name
and number

17:08.484 --> 17:10.487
and the time you called
after the beep.

17:10.570 --> 17:12.614
Hi, Mrs. Merrick,
my name is Kelly Taylor.

17:12.698 --> 17:15.576
I'm calling from Santa Monica,
California.

17:15.659 --> 17:19.121
If you are
the former Mrs. Evers

17:19.204 --> 17:22.583
and you have a son named Joey,
please call me back immediately.

17:22.665 --> 17:28.630
My cellular number is
310-555-7276.

17:28.714 --> 17:29.965
Thanks.

17:37.181 --> 17:38.682
Hey, what's all this?

17:38.766 --> 17:41.185
{\an6}Oh, Steve needs help
at his dad's new
beach house.

17:41.268 --> 17:42.311
{\an3}There's a major storm
coming into town.

17:42.394 --> 17:45.522
{\an4}Well, tell Steve
I would love to shovel
sand with him,

17:45.606 --> 17:47.316
{\an1}but I got
prior commitments.

17:47.399 --> 17:49.818
{\an6}<i>Normal Sins.</i>
What's that,
Rob's next movie?

17:49.902 --> 17:52.446
Yeah, we'll see.
So, did Brandon make a decision

17:52.529 --> 17:54.323
about going to Hong Kong
for spring break?

17:54.406 --> 17:55.699
Oh, yeah, he's gonna go.

17:55.783 --> 17:56.784
Well, that'll be fun
for you two.

17:56.867 --> 17:58.327
Oh, I'm not going.
I'm going to visit my parents.

17:58.410 --> 18:00.537
So, what's he gonna do
with the other ticket?

18:01.747 --> 18:04.208
Hey, guys.
Bye.

18:04.291 --> 18:06.502
All right,
so I got the chainsaw

18:06.585 --> 18:07.711
{\an1}and the shovels
in the trunk.

18:07.795 --> 18:09.046
{\an3}All we need are
a couple of flashlights

18:09.129 --> 18:11.465
and we are good to go.

18:13.425 --> 18:16.178
{\an6}So, uh, when were you
gonna tell me about
the extra ticket?

18:16.261 --> 18:17.346
(metallic clatter)

18:17.429 --> 18:19.181
{\an3}I guess it just slipped
your mind.

18:19.264 --> 18:21.809
Who are you taking?

18:21.892 --> 18:23.477
No one.

18:23.560 --> 18:25.479
So why didn't you ask me?

18:25.562 --> 18:28.524
Uh, well, after you, uh, said
you wanted to go

18:28.607 --> 18:32.361
to your parents' place, I didn't
want to put any pressure on you.

18:32.444 --> 18:34.404
You haven't even told them
about me, have you?

18:34.488 --> 18:35.656
{\an3}They don't even
know I exist.

18:35.739 --> 18:40.869
No, um, they know you exist,
they just don't know your name.

18:40.953 --> 18:42.412
Good, Brandon.

18:52.172 --> 18:53.298
Hey, what you got there?

18:53.382 --> 18:57.052
{\an1}Oh, just looking.
Who's this?

18:57.135 --> 19:03.392
{\an3}Hmm? Ah, it's my second,
uh, third stepfather-- Frank.

19:03.475 --> 19:05.394
{\an1}How many stepfathers
did you have?

19:05.477 --> 19:07.187
{\an3}Too many.

19:07.271 --> 19:09.398
{\an3}But that is Mel,
he's the best.

19:09.481 --> 19:13.610
{\an3}He and my mom had
a baby together-- Erin.

19:13.694 --> 19:14.570
Isn't she cute?

19:14.653 --> 19:18.532
{\an1}Yeah. My mom's gonna have
a baby girl, too.

19:18.615 --> 19:20.242
{\an3}Yeah?

19:20.325 --> 19:22.244
{\an3}You like your mom,
don't you?

19:22.327 --> 19:25.914
{\an1}Yeah.
She was so much fun.

19:25.998 --> 19:28.792
Then my dad died.

19:31.128 --> 19:33.130
I'm sorry, Joey.

19:33.213 --> 19:35.465
You still miss him, huh?

19:35.549 --> 19:38.719
Yeah, he was great.

19:38.802 --> 19:41.263
I still miss my dad

19:41.346 --> 19:43.265
and he <i> isn't</i> so great.

19:44.975 --> 19:46.602
But enough about that.

19:46.685 --> 19:48.604
I'm gonna hit the beach.

19:48.687 --> 19:51.106
Gotta head out to Malibu
and help my friend sandbag

19:51.189 --> 19:54.234
{\an3}his dad's house before
this storm hits.

19:54.318 --> 19:55.611
Oh, I'm sorry.

19:55.694 --> 19:57.487
Did you want to go?
'Cause I didn't think

19:57.571 --> 19:59.156
you'd want to get all wet
and sandy.

20:00.908 --> 20:04.453
Oh, you are gonna get it,
you little monster

20:06.538 --> 20:07.623
{\an1}Hey, Val.

20:07.706 --> 20:08.665
{\an3}Hey.

20:08.749 --> 20:10.042
Your leading man is here.

20:10.125 --> 20:11.960
{\an1}Last power table
on the right.

20:12.044 --> 20:13.045
Thanks.

20:14.254 --> 20:15.422
{\an1}Hey.
Hey, Val.

20:15.505 --> 20:17.132
{\an1}Uh, sit down.
Thanks.

20:17.215 --> 20:18.926
I'd like you to meet my manager.

20:19.009 --> 20:20.093
Alan Black, this
is Valerie Malone.

20:20.177 --> 20:21.094
{\an3}Hi.

20:21.178 --> 20:22.304
{\an3}Well,
Hi.

20:22.387 --> 20:24.306
Rob's been talking my ear off
about you since we got here.

20:24.389 --> 20:26.016
{\an3}I can see why his head's
in such a spin.

20:26.099 --> 20:28.644
Thanks.
Um, he's talked about you, too.

20:28.727 --> 20:30.145
Great, great.

20:30.228 --> 20:31.104
{\an3}Listen, could you give us
a couple minutes

20:31.188 --> 20:32.272
so we can finish up
some business here?

20:32.356 --> 20:33.482
Sure, no problem.

20:33.565 --> 20:35.108
Oh, no, she can stay.

20:37.069 --> 20:38.111
Did you read the script?

20:38.195 --> 20:39.029
Wait a second.

20:39.112 --> 20:40.989
{\an6}You gave her
the script?
Yeah, I wanted

20:41.073 --> 20:43.116
her opinion on it--
You have a problem with that?

20:43.200 --> 20:44.493
No.

20:44.576 --> 20:46.662
So, uh, what'd you think?

20:46.745 --> 20:51.166
Well, um, I had
my reservations about it.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.168
I don't think
it's for you.

20:53.251 --> 20:55.921
Uh, excuse me.
Are you in the film business?

20:56.004 --> 20:58.131
No, I'm not,
but I trust my instincts.

20:58.215 --> 20:59.883
Well, I've got instincts, too,
babe,

20:59.967 --> 21:01.760
and a major motion picture
studio behind this project,

21:01.843 --> 21:04.054
so...
So it's still the wrong project.

21:04.137 --> 21:06.473
{\an1}I mean, this character's
supposed to be a cool

21:06.556 --> 21:07.975
{\an1}and charming antihero,
right?

21:08.058 --> 21:10.143
Well, I don't see anything cool
or charming about him.

21:10.227 --> 21:12.521
{\an1}I mean,
he's a masochistic pig,

21:12.604 --> 21:15.190
totally abusive to women
and totally unredeemable.

21:15.273 --> 21:16.024
Hold on here. Rob,

21:16.108 --> 21:18.360
you said you liked
the script, okay?

21:18.443 --> 21:19.695
That's what you told me.

21:19.778 --> 21:20.612
What the hell do I know, man?

21:20.696 --> 21:22.531
I've only read two scripts
my whole life.

21:22.614 --> 21:23.532
{\an3}Look, there's no
debate here, okay?

21:23.615 --> 21:24.700
I've got a green light on this

21:24.783 --> 21:25.826
as soon as I close the deal.

21:25.909 --> 21:28.370
Fine. Listen, Rob,

21:28.453 --> 21:30.372
{\an1}you wanted my opinion,
I gave it to you.

21:30.455 --> 21:33.041
I just didn't think you had it
in you to play a bastard,

21:33.125 --> 21:34.418
but maybe you're a better actor
than you think.

21:34.501 --> 21:35.711
{\an1}Good luck.

21:35.794 --> 21:38.338
Now, Valerie, wait...

21:38.422 --> 21:41.008
{\an3}Boy, talk about
high maintenance.

21:41.091 --> 21:42.968
{\an3}What, do I have to manage
your love life, too?

21:43.051 --> 21:44.886
Take it easy.
It's just a joke, all right?

21:44.970 --> 21:47.055
Come on, Robby,

21:47.139 --> 21:49.641
don't worry,
it's gonna be fine; trust me.

21:54.146 --> 21:55.897
Please, I just want to see him.

21:55.981 --> 21:57.399
{\an1}I know you want
to see him,

21:57.482 --> 21:59.026
{\an1}but I have
to forewarn you.

21:59.109 --> 22:00.402
{\an3}He's not in good shape
right now.

22:00.485 --> 22:02.738
{\an3}He's paralyzed
on the right side.

22:02.821 --> 22:04.114
He can't speak.

22:04.197 --> 22:05.741
He may not even know
you're there.

22:05.824 --> 22:07.534
I don't care. Please.

22:07.617 --> 22:10.912
Okay.
Let me see what I can do.

22:10.996 --> 22:12.330
Thank you.

22:17.210 --> 22:19.212
{\an1}Well, at least your mom's
on her way back.

22:19.296 --> 22:20.297
Yeah.

22:20.380 --> 22:22.257
You know, you can bet

22:22.340 --> 22:24.801
{\an1}if she was here right now,
she'd be in there seeing him.

22:24.885 --> 22:27.012
Yeah, I know, I wouldn't
doubt that for a minute.

22:29.931 --> 22:31.892
Look, Donna, I'm sorry.

22:31.975 --> 22:34.227
{\an3}I mean, I remember
a ways back,

22:34.311 --> 22:35.479
when you were telling me

22:35.562 --> 22:37.773
that your dad was pushing too
hard and didn't look good and...

22:37.856 --> 22:39.274
David, why were you
at the office?

22:39.357 --> 22:41.943
I just, I wanted to talk.

22:42.027 --> 22:43.820
No, I specifically asked you
not to stir things up.

22:43.904 --> 22:45.822
Just let things be, but you
couldn't do that, could you?

22:45.906 --> 22:47.491
Wait, Donna, I didn't do...

22:47.574 --> 22:49.993
{\an6}No, you got in his face!
You did this to him!
What do you mean,

22:50.077 --> 22:50.911
{\an1}what I did?
You always have

22:50.994 --> 22:52.245
to have everything your way,
don't you?

22:52.329 --> 22:53.038
Never mind anybody else!

22:53.121 --> 22:54.664
Whoa, Donna,
it wasn't like that.

22:54.748 --> 22:56.124
{\an1}Miss Martin?
Yes?

22:56.208 --> 22:57.959
The doctor said you can see him
for just a minute.

22:58.043 --> 22:59.586
Yes, thank you very much.

23:02.839 --> 23:04.966
(device beeping)

23:18.230 --> 23:19.981
Daddy...

23:40.961 --> 23:42.838
{\an5}RADIO DJ:
And now taking a quick look
at the weather,

23:42.921 --> 23:45.173
well, guys, it looks like that
storm out of the Baja

23:45.257 --> 23:47.300
is hitting the coast off San
Diego pretty hard right now.

23:47.384 --> 23:49.010
It should be heading north
to Santa Monica...

23:49.094 --> 23:50.220
Ahoy there!

23:50.303 --> 23:53.181
Hey, the reinforcements have
arrived.

23:53.265 --> 23:55.308
{\an4}KELLY: Yeah, hopefully,
David and Donna are
gonna show up.

23:55.392 --> 23:57.727
But I don't know where they are,
I left her a note.

23:57.811 --> 23:59.646
Clare, I got your S.O.S.
Here's your beer.

23:59.729 --> 24:00.981
Ah, that a girl.

24:01.064 --> 24:02.065
{\an3}BRANDON:
Hey, who's your

24:02.149 --> 24:03.024
little helper?

24:03.108 --> 24:04.192
Oh, this is Joey.

24:04.276 --> 24:06.361
Joey, no. Get down.

24:06.444 --> 24:07.696
What're you doing?

24:07.779 --> 24:09.656
It's cool.

24:09.739 --> 24:10.699
{\an3}It's just sand
down there.

24:10.782 --> 24:11.700
Yeah, but it's deck
behind you.

24:11.783 --> 24:13.493
You could fall and crack
your head open. Come on.

24:13.577 --> 24:15.036
No, I won't, Kelly.

24:15.120 --> 24:17.038
Joey, get down-- we're here
to help, not fool around.

24:17.122 --> 24:18.206
You're not my mother.

24:18.290 --> 24:19.541
No, I'm not.

24:19.624 --> 24:22.669
But you don't need a mother
or a stepfather

24:22.752 --> 24:24.254
or a baby sister
or even a friend.

24:24.337 --> 24:26.214
You don't need anybody, right?

24:26.298 --> 24:29.384
I'm sorry.
What do you want me to do?

24:29.467 --> 24:32.053
Just behave.

24:32.137 --> 24:33.054
Okay.

24:33.138 --> 24:35.891
He's a handful.

24:40.478 --> 24:42.105
{\an3}STEVE:
Look at her.

24:42.189 --> 24:45.066
From princess to longshoreman
all in 24 hours.

24:45.150 --> 24:46.026
One patch of testosterone and
now she eats like a rhino,

24:46.109 --> 24:47.569
drinks like a fish,

24:47.652 --> 24:48.528
she leaves a mess everywhere.

24:48.612 --> 24:50.780
{\an3}I bet the sex is great, huh?
She's an animal.

24:50.864 --> 24:53.074
Testosterone is some
pretty scary stuff.

24:53.158 --> 24:54.242
In the wrong hands, maybe.

24:54.326 --> 24:56.745
{\an3}How so?
Steve,

24:56.828 --> 24:58.914
{\an1}testosterone
is a male hormone.

24:58.997 --> 24:59.915
It's oiled the machinery

24:59.998 --> 25:02.751
that brought about war,
famine, pestilence,

25:02.834 --> 25:04.628
not to mention

25:04.711 --> 25:05.879
{\an1}hostile corporate
takeovers.

25:05.962 --> 25:08.757
Great.
War, famine, pestilence.

25:08.840 --> 25:09.674
Oh, boy.

25:12.344 --> 25:15.096
Hey, Trace, are you gonna talk
to me

25:15.180 --> 25:16.765
at some point
here or what?

25:16.848 --> 25:18.099
What's there to talk about?

25:18.183 --> 25:20.060
We obviously just have
different priorities.

25:20.143 --> 25:22.938
Look, I haven't seen my parents
in a long time.

25:23.021 --> 25:24.898
{\an3}They're just gonna want
to talk to me

25:24.981 --> 25:25.774
about everything that's

25:25.857 --> 25:27.442
{\an3}been going on.
It's gonna be boring.

25:27.525 --> 25:28.652
Well, thank you for your
concern,

25:28.735 --> 25:31.780
but I've been fond of my own
company long before I met you.

25:31.863 --> 25:33.406
{\an3}You're making way
too much out of this.

25:33.490 --> 25:34.658
{\an1}Am I?

25:34.741 --> 25:36.493
I couldn't wait to tell
my parents about you.

25:36.576 --> 25:38.620
What, do you think I'm trying
to hide you from my parents?

25:38.703 --> 25:40.872
What, are you crazy?

25:43.041 --> 25:45.669
All right, look, I can see this
is important

25:45.752 --> 25:48.296
{\an3}to you, so

25:48.380 --> 25:49.756
of course you should come
with me to Hong Kong.

25:49.839 --> 25:51.633
I'd love to have you there
with me.

25:51.716 --> 25:55.136
You know what, Brandon?
I'll make it simple for you.

25:55.220 --> 25:57.639
I don't want to go.

26:06.356 --> 26:07.691
ELECTRONIC VOICE:
One message

26:07.774 --> 26:11.152
taken at 7:30 p.m.

26:11.236 --> 26:12.988
(machine clicks and beeps)

26:13.071 --> 26:15.156
{\an5}(on machine):
Hello, Valerie?
It's Rob.

26:15.240 --> 26:18.326
Listen, I'm sorry about how it
all went with my manager today.

26:18.410 --> 26:19.869
I thought about what
you had to say

26:19.953 --> 26:22.539
and I've decided
not to do the movie.

26:22.622 --> 26:24.374
I'd like to see you tonight.

26:24.457 --> 26:25.792
Come by, okay?

26:25.875 --> 26:28.169
I don't care how late.

26:28.253 --> 26:30.130
(machine clicks and beeps)

26:38.054 --> 26:39.806
{\an1}You're going to have
to eat sometime.

26:39.889 --> 26:41.016
No, thanks.

26:41.099 --> 26:42.851
I'm not hungry.

26:42.934 --> 26:44.644
{\an1}Yeah, just like
I'm not to blame.

26:44.728 --> 26:47.731
David, please don't start.

26:47.814 --> 26:49.858
{\an3}You know, maybe
you should just go.

26:53.486 --> 26:55.196
No, you know what?

26:55.280 --> 26:57.324
I want you to hear me out.

26:59.159 --> 27:02.078
As much as I regret
what happened today,

27:02.162 --> 27:04.205
{\an1}I didn't give
your father his stroke.

27:04.289 --> 27:06.708
But you pressured him.

27:06.791 --> 27:08.668
{\an1}No, Donna.
He needed a break.

27:08.752 --> 27:09.753
{\an1}He pulled me
into his office.

27:09.836 --> 27:12.505
{\an1}I just wanted to talk to him.
Why?

27:12.589 --> 27:14.507
Because.

27:14.591 --> 27:17.385
{\an1}Because I wanted him
to know how I felt about you.

27:21.598 --> 27:22.682
I love you.

27:22.766 --> 27:24.893
{\an1}I think your mother
and father should know

27:24.976 --> 27:26.936
that I want to have
a future with you.

27:27.979 --> 27:30.523
{\an3}Oh, God...

27:30.607 --> 27:31.941
David, I'm so sorry.

27:32.025 --> 27:34.194
It's all right.

27:34.277 --> 27:36.029
I'm just so scared, you know?

27:36.112 --> 27:37.489
{\an1}I know.

27:39.115 --> 27:41.409
Look, I talked to one
of the neurologists.

27:41.493 --> 27:43.578
He told me the tPA

27:43.661 --> 27:46.081
{\an1}that they gave your dad
could take some time

27:46.164 --> 27:48.041
to have any effect.

27:48.124 --> 27:49.417
But if it does,

27:49.501 --> 27:51.419
{\an1}he could regain
his faculties

27:51.503 --> 27:53.963
{\an1}and then he'll have a really
good chance for recovery.

27:54.047 --> 27:55.715
You didn't see him.

27:57.008 --> 27:59.260
I was watching my father's
life slip away,

27:59.344 --> 28:01.429
right in front of my eyes.

28:01.513 --> 28:03.348
He was completely helpless.

28:04.849 --> 28:06.893
Donna, come on.

28:06.976 --> 28:08.978
Got to be positive.

28:10.480 --> 28:12.607
{\an1}We've got a really
long night ahead of us.

28:19.656 --> 28:21.116
{\an3}Hey, why don't
you guys wash up?

28:21.199 --> 28:22.617
{\an3}Food's going
to be ready soon.

28:30.500 --> 28:32.627
(no audio)

28:37.257 --> 28:39.426
{\an3}Whose monster
margarita is this?

28:39.509 --> 28:41.428
Clare's.
Clare's.

28:41.511 --> 28:42.804
You're kidding, right?

28:42.887 --> 28:44.973
No, but she may be.

28:45.056 --> 28:46.808
Oh, I get it.

28:46.891 --> 28:48.393
{\an3}The patch.
Hm.

28:48.476 --> 28:49.602
Poor Sanders.

28:49.686 --> 28:50.812
Falling victim to those

28:50.895 --> 28:51.980
feminine wiles again.

28:52.063 --> 28:53.481
Hmm, but never you. No.

28:53.565 --> 28:55.316
I guess you've noticed
Tracy and I aren't, uh,

28:55.400 --> 28:57.152
exactly on the same page
today, huh?

28:57.235 --> 28:59.988
It wouldn't have
anything to do with your

29:00.071 --> 29:01.823
{\an3}trip to Hong Kong, would it?
Who told you?

29:01.906 --> 29:03.533
{\an1}Steve?
Who else?

29:03.616 --> 29:06.786
But you must be so excited
to see your parents again.

29:06.870 --> 29:08.204
I haven't had a chance
to get excited yet.

29:08.288 --> 29:10.206
Tracy's been all over me
about this thing.

29:10.290 --> 29:11.541
{\an3}She's overreacting
a little bit,

29:11.624 --> 29:13.835
don't you think?

29:13.918 --> 29:15.837
I think, Brandon,

29:15.920 --> 29:18.715
there are a lot of things about
women you don't understand.

29:19.716 --> 29:20.884
What's that supposed to mean?

29:22.260 --> 29:24.387
{\an3}Hey, you guys,
news flash.

29:24.471 --> 29:25.847
{\an3}There's a big accident
on the P.C.H.

29:25.930 --> 29:27.348
{\an3}Some of the power
lines are down.

29:27.432 --> 29:28.683
{\an3}The roads are
closed for the night.

29:28.766 --> 29:30.393
Malibu, a way of life.

29:30.477 --> 29:32.353
Well, it looks like
Storm Watch '97

29:32.437 --> 29:33.855
just turned into a sleepover.

29:33.938 --> 29:36.191
{\an3}All right!
Hey, chow's on.

29:36.274 --> 29:37.984
Come and get it.

29:38.067 --> 29:40.361
{\an1}Here, carry that.
(phone rings)

29:40.445 --> 29:41.488
Oh, wait, wait,
can you take these?

29:41.571 --> 29:42.906
{\an3}I've got to get that.
Wait, wait.

29:42.989 --> 29:44.282
{\an3}Got it?
Got it.

29:44.365 --> 29:47.327
(ringing continues)

29:47.410 --> 29:48.703
Hello?

29:48.786 --> 29:50.038
MRS. MERRICK:
Is this Kelly Taylor?

29:50.121 --> 29:51.206
Yes, this is Kelly Taylor.

29:51.289 --> 29:53.374
Hi, this is Mrs. Merrick.
Mrs. Merrick.

29:53.458 --> 29:56.211
Is Joey with you?
Yes, he's with me right now.

29:56.294 --> 29:59.214
You have a very resourceful son,
Mrs. Merrick.

29:59.297 --> 30:00.715
He found his way to L.A.,

30:00.798 --> 30:02.675
and showed up on my deck
over a week ago,

30:02.759 --> 30:04.385
cold and hungry.

30:04.469 --> 30:07.347
I took him in, and then I turned
him in to Social Services,

30:07.430 --> 30:09.224
but he ran away
from their shelter.

30:09.307 --> 30:11.518
Fortunately,
he found his way back to me.

30:11.601 --> 30:13.102
But he is all right?

30:13.186 --> 30:15.021
Physically, yes.

30:15.104 --> 30:15.980
Emotionally, no.

30:16.064 --> 30:17.982
I'll get right to the point,
Mrs. Merrick.

30:18.066 --> 30:20.527
Joey told me
that you've remarried

30:20.610 --> 30:22.737
and that you're
expecting a baby, and that

30:22.820 --> 30:23.947
you don't care
about him anymore.

30:24.030 --> 30:29.077
Oh, God, believe me, nothing
could be further from the truth.

30:29.160 --> 30:31.246
I love my son.

30:31.329 --> 30:33.122
And so does my husband,
I mean...

30:33.206 --> 30:35.708
We've been worried
sick about him.

30:35.792 --> 30:38.253
Look, um, we can drive
to Albuquerque.

30:38.336 --> 30:40.213
And we can be on the first plane
out in the morning.

30:40.296 --> 30:42.131
Okay, good.

30:42.215 --> 30:44.092
Um, first, you should call
a Chuck Grant

30:44.175 --> 30:45.635
at Social Services
here in L.A.,

30:45.718 --> 30:47.595
and let him know that we're
making our own arrangements.

30:47.679 --> 30:49.639
I'm sure he'll want
to ask you some questions.

30:49.722 --> 30:50.974
All right.

30:51.057 --> 30:53.768
Um, Miss Taylor?

30:53.851 --> 30:55.270
Please, call me Kelly.

30:55.353 --> 30:57.939
Kelly, thank you so much
and God bless you.

30:58.022 --> 30:59.816
You're our savior,
you know that?

30:59.899 --> 31:02.402
Well, you have a great kid,
Mrs. Merrick.

31:02.485 --> 31:04.112
I look forward to meeting you.

31:04.195 --> 31:05.613
Me, too.

31:05.697 --> 31:08.157
(phone beeps off)

31:12.704 --> 31:14.747
(knocking)

31:20.253 --> 31:22.380
Better late
than never, right?

31:22.463 --> 31:24.299
{\an3}I'm glad you're here.
(soft chuckle)

31:25.675 --> 31:28.094
Oh, I like the way
you decorate.

31:29.929 --> 31:30.972
{\an3}I'd like to show
you something.

31:31.055 --> 31:33.057
Okay.

31:35.977 --> 31:36.978
{\an1}It's something
I've been working on.

31:37.061 --> 31:38.229
I hope you like it.

31:40.898 --> 31:42.900
For you.

31:45.987 --> 31:49.824
Rob, uh... I don't know
what to say.

31:49.907 --> 31:52.285
All right, well,
what do you think?

31:54.579 --> 31:57.081
I think, um...

31:58.583 --> 32:01.336
I think I want
to stay the night.

32:01.419 --> 32:04.005
If that's okay with you.

32:04.088 --> 32:05.965
Are you sure?

32:07.383 --> 32:09.802
Didn't anybody ever teach you

32:09.886 --> 32:12.263
not to answer a question
with a question?

32:18.102 --> 32:20.021
I'm a slow learner.

32:20.104 --> 32:22.148
Good.

32:47.173 --> 32:49.175
(monitor beeping)

33:07.777 --> 33:09.779
Good morning, Daddy.

33:10.822 --> 33:11.864
Daddy, can you hear me?

33:11.948 --> 33:13.950
It's Donna.

33:15.201 --> 33:17.453
Daddy.

33:17.537 --> 33:19.580
It's time to wake up now.

33:21.833 --> 33:24.752
{\an5}RADIO DJ:
Well, that storm out of Baja
didn't go north after all.

33:24.836 --> 33:27.588
It's now pushed inland,
making tracks for the desert.

33:27.672 --> 33:29.924
So all is calm today
on the Santa Monica Bay.

33:30.007 --> 33:30.758
Wake...
(radio clicks off)

33:30.842 --> 33:32.552
{\an1}Morning, babe!
(groans)

33:32.635 --> 33:33.928
{\an3}Clare, what are
you doing?

33:34.011 --> 33:35.888
{\an1}Morning.
(groans)

33:35.972 --> 33:36.973
What can I say?

33:37.056 --> 33:38.725
I'm a morning person.

33:38.808 --> 33:40.768
{\an6}Ooh! Clare, come on,
enough already.
(moans)

33:40.852 --> 33:42.603
{\an3}Come on, stop, please?
I'm not in the mood.

33:42.687 --> 33:43.938
I didn't even brush my teeth.

33:44.021 --> 33:45.440
{\an1}Well, I have.
Don't worry about it.

33:45.523 --> 33:46.733
Come on, I'll be gentle.

33:46.816 --> 33:47.942
Oh, no, come on, really.

33:48.025 --> 33:49.610
{\an3}I can't take
anymore, honey.

33:49.694 --> 33:51.821
Come on, baby.

33:51.904 --> 33:54.282
{\an1}I want it
and I want it now.

33:54.365 --> 33:55.867
Clare, no, no.

33:55.950 --> 33:57.118
Get off of me!

33:57.201 --> 33:58.911
{\an3}What?
That's, that's it.

34:01.748 --> 34:04.333
Either you quit
this hormone trip

34:04.417 --> 34:05.793
or we're done.

34:05.877 --> 34:08.004
I-I, I, I...
I can't take it.

34:08.087 --> 34:09.922
Why, you're going to break up
with me over a little

34:10.005 --> 34:11.132
testosterone?

34:11.215 --> 34:12.967
A little testosterone?

34:13.050 --> 34:14.552
Ever since you
put on that patch,

34:14.635 --> 34:16.304
your behavior
is completely...

34:16.387 --> 34:17.304
Obnoxious?

34:17.388 --> 34:18.639
Exactly.

34:18.723 --> 34:20.641
Not to mention rude,
insensitive...

34:20.725 --> 34:22.935
Boorish?
Neanderthal?

34:23.018 --> 34:25.271
{\an6}Let's not forget sex-crazed,
shall we?
What do you mean?

34:25.353 --> 34:26.813
You love sex.

34:26.898 --> 34:29.442
Yeah, I love sex, but what
happened to a little romance.

34:29.525 --> 34:31.235
{\an1}Huh? All of a sudden
it's "wham-bam,

34:31.319 --> 34:32.820
thank-you, man."
And quite frankly,

34:32.904 --> 34:35.031
{\an6}it leaves me feeling
a little...
Used?

34:35.114 --> 34:36.783
Taken for granted?

34:36.866 --> 34:39.659
Yeah, exactly.

34:39.744 --> 34:41.036
I don't know

34:41.120 --> 34:42.621
who you are anymore.

34:42.705 --> 34:45.666
Well, let me give you a clue.

34:47.752 --> 34:48.668
I've been you.

34:48.753 --> 34:50.545
Me?

34:50.630 --> 34:52.215
That's who you've been spending
the last 24 hours with.

34:52.297 --> 34:54.467
Uh-huh, what's that
supposed to mean?

34:57.261 --> 34:58.554
It's fake.

34:58.638 --> 35:01.557
It's a bandage.

35:01.641 --> 35:03.768
You've been playing a joke
on me this whole time?

35:05.061 --> 35:08.523
Yeah. And I'm quitting
before it kills me.

35:08.606 --> 35:10.024
It ain't pretty being you, babe.

35:10.107 --> 35:11.818
Clare, am I really
that rude?

35:11.901 --> 35:14.862
Am I that insensitive?

35:16.572 --> 35:19.534
All right.
I didn't realize.

35:19.617 --> 35:20.743
I'm sorry.

35:20.827 --> 35:22.829
It's okay.

35:22.912 --> 35:26.374
Do you think maybe we can go
for a calm walk on the beach?

35:26.457 --> 35:27.500
Just you and I?

35:27.583 --> 35:29.544
Could we do that?

35:29.627 --> 35:31.045
Yeah, I think so.

35:31.128 --> 35:34.715
{\an3}Maybe we could
look for seashells.

35:34.799 --> 35:36.801
I'd like that.

35:40.096 --> 35:42.098
{\an1}Ooh.
(giggles)

35:46.143 --> 35:47.687
{\an1}Morning.
Morning.

35:47.770 --> 35:49.522
Where's Tracy?

35:49.605 --> 35:50.690
{\an1}Well, the road
opened up early.

35:50.773 --> 35:52.358
She took off.

35:52.441 --> 35:54.443
Sorry.
(groans)

35:55.862 --> 35:57.572
{\an1}You know, Kel,
I think you're right.

35:57.655 --> 35:59.240
{\an1}There's a lot
of things about women

35:59.323 --> 36:01.284
that I don't understand.

36:01.367 --> 36:03.411
Well, I could say the
same thing about men.

36:03.494 --> 36:05.413
But that's what
we're here for.

36:05.496 --> 36:06.455
To live and learn, right?

36:06.539 --> 36:08.249
Yeah, I guess.

36:10.668 --> 36:12.587
I was, uh, keeping an eye

36:12.670 --> 36:15.214
{\an4}on the little guy for you;
he's right out there.
Thanks.

36:24.473 --> 36:26.392
Hey. Did you hear the good news?
Hey, bud.

36:26.475 --> 36:27.602
What's that?
No storm.

36:27.685 --> 36:29.437
{\an3}Oh, yeah. Can't thank
you guys enough

36:29.520 --> 36:31.230
{\an5}for helping me
look good here.
No problem.

36:31.314 --> 36:32.398
But the fun's over.

36:32.481 --> 36:33.649
I guess we should
go out and start

36:33.733 --> 36:36.277
{\an5}taking down that
big wall of sandbags.
Oh, no, no, no, no.

36:36.360 --> 36:38.779
No. I want you to leave those
sandbags right where they are.

36:38.863 --> 36:40.448
My old man is flying in today.

36:40.531 --> 36:42.283
I want him to see
all the hard work we put in.

36:42.366 --> 36:44.410
(laughs)

36:53.377 --> 36:55.922
You know,
when my mom married Mel,

36:56.005 --> 36:58.215
I thought, "Oh, great.

36:58.299 --> 37:00.927
"Here we go again,
another jerk.

37:01.010 --> 37:04.472
Another guy trying
to pull my mom away from me."

37:04.555 --> 37:06.599
But my stepbrother, David,

37:06.682 --> 37:08.976
{\an1}showed me that
I was being the jerk.

37:09.060 --> 37:12.939
He told me to give
his dad a second chance.

37:13.022 --> 37:14.732
So I did.

37:14.815 --> 37:17.985
Now, I have another
great person in my life

37:18.069 --> 37:19.445
that I can always count on.

37:19.528 --> 37:21.155
Good for you.

37:21.239 --> 37:23.366
{\an1}Everybody deserves
a second chance, Joey.

37:23.449 --> 37:26.035
That's what Ernie's
trying to give your mom.

37:26.118 --> 37:29.163
A second chance at love,
a second child...

37:29.246 --> 37:32.625
{\an1}No, he can never
replace your real father.

37:32.708 --> 37:35.336
But I'll bet,
if you give him a chance,

37:35.419 --> 37:37.213
Ernie could turn out
to be someone

37:37.296 --> 37:38.714
that you can always count on.

37:38.798 --> 37:41.050
Yeah, well, you don't know
that for sure.

37:41.133 --> 37:42.551
No, I don't.

37:42.635 --> 37:43.803
Neither do you.

37:43.886 --> 37:46.222
That's why we have
to have the courage

37:46.305 --> 37:47.848
to take second chances.

37:50.309 --> 37:52.311
You were brave enough
to come to L.A.

37:54.313 --> 37:56.649
The question is,

37:56.732 --> 37:58.526
are you brave enough
to go home?

38:00.236 --> 38:02.321
(gasping):
Joey!

38:06.283 --> 38:07.702
Hi, sweetie!

38:07.785 --> 38:09.537
(laughing)

38:09.620 --> 38:12.373
Oh, how are you?

38:14.291 --> 38:16.460
{\an3}Go. Go and say
"hi," okay?

38:21.465 --> 38:23.217
{\an1}You're mad at me,
aren't you?

38:23.300 --> 38:24.927
No.

38:25.011 --> 38:27.013
Absolutely not.

38:44.947 --> 38:46.449
Got a minute?

38:46.532 --> 38:48.200
I was in the area.

38:48.284 --> 38:50.286
You were?

38:51.829 --> 38:53.831
Okay.

38:55.458 --> 38:58.294
{\an3}Look, obviously I
underestimated you, Valerie.

38:58.377 --> 39:00.129
You're not a bimbo.

39:00.212 --> 39:02.089
{\an3}Okay, you're bright
and you're beautiful.

39:02.173 --> 39:04.258
{\an3}You run a successful
business here,

39:04.341 --> 39:05.926
{\an3}and you have the guts
to follow your instincts.

39:06.010 --> 39:07.762
What do you want, Alan?

39:07.845 --> 39:08.804
I want to cut a deal.

39:08.888 --> 39:10.806
"A deal"?

39:10.890 --> 39:13.476
Look, we both want
what's best for Rob

39:13.559 --> 39:14.894
<i>and</i> ourselves;
am I right?

39:14.977 --> 39:17.396
He's not doing the movie.

39:17.480 --> 39:18.939
No, he's not doing
that script.

39:19.023 --> 39:21.108
{\an3}I talked to the
studio this morning.

39:21.192 --> 39:24.403
I passed along your notes
and your concerns.

39:24.487 --> 39:26.614
They've hired a top writer
to do a major rewrite.

39:26.697 --> 39:28.908
Well, when it's done,
we'll read it.

39:28.991 --> 39:31.786
No, I think you can do a little
bit better than that.

39:31.869 --> 39:33.621
{\an3}I'd like for you
to use your

39:33.704 --> 39:34.789
obvious powers
of persuasions

39:34.872 --> 39:36.499
to recommit
my client to the project.

39:36.582 --> 39:39.585
{\an6}No, I think we should wait
and read the new script.
No.

39:39.668 --> 39:42.171
Good script, bad script--
I need a guarantee.

39:42.254 --> 39:44.673
Well, I don't know
if I can do what you're asking.

39:46.592 --> 39:48.094
All right.

39:48.177 --> 39:50.012
{\an3}Then perhaps I
can persuade you.

39:53.599 --> 39:55.476
That's ten grand.

39:58.562 --> 40:00.689
Another ten grand
is forthcoming

40:00.773 --> 40:02.817
when Rob signs
the studio contract.

40:02.900 --> 40:05.528
Hollywood can be, uh,
kind of a tough town

40:05.611 --> 40:06.946
for a naive
Indiana boy.

40:07.029 --> 40:08.989
But I say it's lucky
for him that he has

40:09.073 --> 40:11.075
two professionals like you
and me looking out for him.

40:17.206 --> 40:18.624
I agree.

40:25.589 --> 40:27.883
So, anyway,
when Joey's mom showed him

40:27.967 --> 40:31.011
the missing children's posters,
all doubts disappeared.

40:31.095 --> 40:33.222
And when his stepdad gave him
the boogie board

40:33.305 --> 40:35.224
and told him that they could
stay in Malibu a few days

40:35.307 --> 40:37.518
so he could
learn how to surf,

40:37.601 --> 40:38.686
he forgot all about me.

40:38.769 --> 40:41.522
Oh, I doubt that, Kel.

40:41.605 --> 40:43.691
{\an1}I mean, I really doubt it.
I'm going to miss him.

40:43.774 --> 40:45.901
Ah, we are going through
a little maternal withdrawal,

40:45.985 --> 40:48.154
{\an1}are we?
I guess so, yeah.

40:48.237 --> 40:49.488
Well, I have
the solution.

40:49.572 --> 40:51.532
Any time you want
to babysit Little Frankie

40:51.615 --> 40:53.451
for Joanie and me,
be my guest.

40:53.534 --> 40:55.369
Ha-ha.
Thanks, Nat.

40:55.452 --> 40:57.329
(chuckles)

41:02.543 --> 41:04.587
Hi.
Hey.

41:04.670 --> 41:07.047
I owe you an apology.

41:07.131 --> 41:08.841
I didn't mean to desert you
this morning.

41:08.924 --> 41:10.885
{\an3}Oh, I think I owe
you an apology.

41:10.968 --> 41:13.012
Sit down.

41:15.306 --> 41:16.891
Listen, why don't
we just drop this.

41:16.974 --> 41:19.018
{\an1}We'll go on our breaks
and we'll see what happens

41:19.101 --> 41:21.061
when we get back.

41:21.145 --> 41:23.564
{\an3}Uh, you know, Trace,
I've been, uh...

41:23.647 --> 41:26.942
I've been thinking about
why I didn't just ask you

41:27.026 --> 41:28.903
to go to Hong Kong with me
in the first place.

41:28.986 --> 41:31.405
And what did you come up with?

41:33.616 --> 41:35.242
Taking someone
across the ocean

41:35.326 --> 41:36.702
to meet your parents
is a big step.

41:38.204 --> 41:40.331
Yeah. It is.

41:40.414 --> 41:42.249
So the question is,

41:42.333 --> 41:44.919
am I ready to take that step?

41:46.545 --> 41:47.922
And the answer is yeah.

41:48.005 --> 41:49.882
{\an3}I am.

41:51.342 --> 41:54.345
So...

41:54.428 --> 41:55.721
would you like
to come with me?

41:57.389 --> 41:59.225
I'd love to.

42:21.205 --> 42:22.957
Donna, wake up.

42:23.040 --> 42:27.127
Donna?

42:27.211 --> 42:28.587
Someone would like
to see you.

42:39.390 --> 42:41.141
Daddy?

42:41.225 --> 42:44.478
Hello...

42:44.561 --> 42:46.605
Precious.

42:47.731 --> 42:49.483
Daddy, it's me.

42:49.567 --> 42:52.111
It's Donna.

42:58.409 --> 43:01.412
Who else...

43:03.539 --> 43:06.125
...would my precious be?

43:10.546 --> 43:12.506
It's going to be all right.

43:12.589 --> 43:14.425
We're going to get you
all better, okay?
