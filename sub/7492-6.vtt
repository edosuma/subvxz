WEBVTT

00:01.667 --> 00:03.208
The babysitter...

00:03.834 --> 00:05.417
thought she was safe,

00:05.500 --> 00:08.625
- but what she didn't know was--
- Was what?

00:09.375 --> 00:11.917
The clown with the chainsaw

00:12.000 --> 00:13.959
was watching her from--

00:14.041 --> 00:18.125
- From where?
...inside the house!

00:21.625 --> 00:24.291
Okay, that's it.
I'm putting an end to this fake camp-out.

00:24.375 --> 00:25.458
Aw.

00:26.125 --> 00:26.959
Hey!

00:27.083 --> 00:29.333
There is nothing fake about our camp-out.

00:29.417 --> 00:31.083
Now turn the fire back on.

00:31.667 --> 00:33.959
Rudy, if you just apologized
to the park ranger,

00:34.083 --> 00:36.041
maybe he'll let us back
into the Seaford Campground.

00:36.125 --> 00:38.166
- I am not apologizing to anybody.
<i>Rudy,</i>

00:38.250 --> 00:40.208
you hit him repeatedly
with your canoe paddle.

00:40.291 --> 00:42.917
I thought a bear was attacking my boat!

00:43.166 --> 00:45.709
If you're that hairy,
you should not be swimming in public.

00:46.542 --> 00:47.917
Why don't I get everyone in the mood

00:48.041 --> 00:50.041
with some good,
old-fashioned campfire songs?

00:50.125 --> 00:51.166
Please don't.

00:52.959 --> 00:55.083
<i>♪ Oh... ♪</i>

00:55.166 --> 00:56.458
<i>♪ She'll be coming... ♪</i>

00:56.542 --> 00:58.542

<i>- ♪ ...Around the mountain when-- ♪</i>

01:00.542 --> 01:02.875
Well, you got farther into the song
than last year.

01:02.959 --> 01:04.375
- Yeah.
- Oh, that's very true.

01:04.458 --> 01:05.750
- You know, I'm outta here.
- Me too.

01:05.834 --> 01:07.000
I'm out.
Yeah.

01:07.083 --> 01:08.250
No!

01:08.333 --> 01:09.709
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:09.792 --> 01:12.041
See, you know, I knew you city slickers

01:12.125 --> 01:13.875
wouldn't last out here in the wild.

01:13.959 --> 01:17.041
That's why I did what
any responsible camp counselor would do.

01:17.125 --> 01:19.458
Padlocked the door and swallowed the key.

01:19.542 --> 01:20.542
What?

01:21.625 --> 01:22.917
<i>Settle in, campers!</i>

01:23.000 --> 01:25.542
It's gonna be three days
before we see that key again.

01:27.208 --> 01:29.000
Oh, well, two if I eat a fiber bar.

01:30.834 --> 01:32.083
Hey, hey, check it out.

01:32.166 --> 01:34.000
Those guys are coming out
of the Athletic Authority.

01:34.083 --> 01:36.500
Oh, sweet!
Must be their annual ski mask sale.

01:36.750 --> 01:38.542
Jerry, those are robbers!

01:41.417 --> 01:43.417
Hurry up! Open the door!
We gotta stop 'em.

01:43.500 --> 01:44.625
I'll get the key.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.750
Car key, key to the riding mower.

01:51.834 --> 01:53.709
Oh, anybody want a jelly bean?

01:54.583 --> 01:55.917

Any details about the way he looked
will help our sketch artist.

02:45.041 --> 02:46.250
Oh, there was something.

02:46.333 --> 02:49.166
Yeah, in the middle of his face
he had this mound of flesh

02:49.250 --> 02:51.000
that had two holes in it.

02:51.083 --> 02:52.542
You mean a nose?

02:53.250 --> 02:54.667
You are good.

02:55.834 --> 02:58.000
All right, guys, we told the sketch artist
what he looked like

02:58.083 --> 02:59.583
and he drew a really good likeness of him.

02:59.667 --> 03:01.208
Don't need it. Drew it myself.

03:01.458 --> 03:03.875
Detective, this is your man.

03:05.792 --> 03:08.083
Or you could look for this guy.

03:08.166 --> 03:09.542
Yeah.

03:09.625 --> 03:11.959
Good luck fishing in the dark
with that mess.

03:15.583 --> 03:17.583
That's Benny the Blade.

03:17.792 --> 03:20.375
We've been trying
to put him away for years.

03:20.667 --> 03:23.542
But nobody's ever been brave enough
to point the finger at him.

03:23.625 --> 03:27.333
Not until Rudy Gillespie came along!

03:27.792 --> 03:28.709
You see this finger?

03:28.834 --> 03:32.333
It was born to do two things,
and one of them is point at bad guys.

03:32.792 --> 03:34.041
What's the other thing?

03:34.125 --> 03:36.417
I don't feel comfortable saying it
in front of the cop.

03:40.583 --> 03:44.500
We arrested the suspect.
Now we just need you to identify him.

03:44.583 --> 03:45.583
<i>Uh...</i>

03:45.667 --> 03:47.834
I know how this works.
This is two-way glass.

03:47.917 --> 03:49.250
Benny can't see us.

03:49.625 --> 03:50.792
You know, this is kinda exciting.

03:50.875 --> 03:51.792
I know.

03:51.875 --> 03:54.667
No one has ever identified this guy
because he's so dangerous.

03:54.750 --> 03:58.500
Not till Rudy J. Gillespie came along.

03:59.125 --> 04:00.709
The "J" stands for justice.

04:01.417 --> 04:03.166
I thought you said it stood
for jam master.

04:03.291 --> 04:04.542
- Jujitsu.
- Jaguar.

04:04.625 --> 04:05.458
Jermaine.

04:05.542 --> 04:07.792
All right, it changes with the situation!

04:09.917 --> 04:13.375
- So, let the record show that I...

04:13.458 --> 04:15.792
...Rudy Gillespie, along with my students,

04:15.875 --> 04:18.250

04:39.166 --> 04:43.166
I am feeling pretty great
about putting Benny away.

04:43.250 --> 04:44.125
Yeah, you should.

04:44.208 --> 04:47.375
You committed a selfless act
and helped make Seaford a safer place.

04:47.458 --> 04:50.208
Oh, that's not why.
I'm getting a $5,000 reward.

04:51.458 --> 04:54.166
Hey, we all identified him,
so we should all share the reward money.

04:54.250 --> 04:55.500
What reward money?

04:58.125 --> 05:00.458
Fine. We'll split it five ways.

05:00.625 --> 05:02.166
Ooh, ooh! Turn on the news.

05:02.250 --> 05:04.500
We'll watch Benny get taken
into the courthouse for sentencing.

05:06.500 --> 05:08.834
<i>This is Chappy Chapman

05:08.917 --> 05:10.750
<i>awaiting the arrival of Benny the Blade.</i>

05:10.834 --> 05:13.625
I'll say it, Chappy's got the best hair
in Seaford.

05:13.917 --> 05:16.083
Seriously, dude? I'm sitting right here.

05:17.792 --> 05:19.250
<i>It looks like the van has just arrived,</i>

05:19.333 --> 05:21.125
<i>and Benny is being taken

I gotta go call my mother!

05:53.709 --> 05:55.333

Oh, he heard it. Three, two, one.

We have to travel lightly.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.542
All right, Rudy, what's the plan?
Where are we going?

06:16.625 --> 06:17.834
- Uh--
- That's where I come in.

06:17.917 --> 06:20.792
Tonight we will travel south to Guatemala.

06:20.875 --> 06:24.417
There we will live as a talented
but reasonably priced mariachi band.

06:24.917 --> 06:26.208
Mariachi band?

06:26.250 --> 06:27.208
<i>Si.</i>

06:27.458 --> 06:30.875
And I am the leader Señorita Rosa.

06:31.333 --> 06:33.125
Why would you play a woman?

06:33.250 --> 06:35.709

Oh. Good point.

- Hey.

07:02.041 --> 07:03.250
Any news on Benny?

07:03.333 --> 07:04.583
We're still looking for him.

07:04.667 --> 07:05.792
But we've got a plan.

07:05.875 --> 07:08.375
The five of you are going
into witness protection.

07:08.458 --> 07:11.834
Good call. Witness protection.

07:13.125 --> 07:14.750
Why don't you explain what it is
to the kids,

07:14.834 --> 07:17.959
because I definitely know what it is...
that, that is.

07:19.417 --> 07:21.875
We take you to a secret location
and give you new identities.

07:21.959 --> 07:24.333
You can return after Blade is captured.

07:24.417 --> 07:26.625
Ohh, this is gonna be great.

07:26.917 --> 07:29.709
The cops are gonna pay for us to hang out
and play volleyball with girls

07:29.792 --> 07:31.125
at an exotic resort?

07:31.208 --> 07:33.625
Nah, nah, forget that.
I say we go to a cabin in the mountains,

07:33.709 --> 07:35.041
get our snowboard on.

07:35.125 --> 07:36.291
I don't do cold.

07:36.375 --> 07:38.750
I once got hypothermia from a smoothie.

07:39.208 --> 07:42.041
I bet it's a cruise.
I'm gonna need my own state room.

07:42.125 --> 07:43.417
If she's getting one, I'm getting one.

07:43.500 --> 07:45.208
- Me too!
- All right, it's settled!

07:45.250 --> 07:47.000
State rooms all around.

07:47.083 --> 07:48.250
Yes!

07:48.333 --> 07:50.500
I am gonna need a balcony with a hot tub.

07:50.583 --> 07:52.917
Look, you're not going on a--

07:53.000 --> 07:54.250
No, no, no, don't tell us.

07:54.500 --> 07:56.083
We wanna be surprised.

07:57.667 --> 07:59.667

08:01.792 --> 08:03.291
When it comes to surprises,

08:03.375 --> 08:05.542
you, sir, are horrible.

08:10.417 --> 08:13.125
Hiding on a farm
in the middle of Homesdale

08:13.208 --> 08:15.041
is not what we had in mind.

08:15.208 --> 08:17.250
Benny the Blade is a dangerous man.

08:17.333 --> 08:18.792
And this is the last place he would look.

08:18.875 --> 08:20.125
Yeah, I don't blame him.

08:20.208 --> 08:21.959
That cow just peed on the floor.

08:22.041 --> 08:24.875
Remember, you're experienced farmhands.

08:24.959 --> 08:26.625
You have to blend in and stay hidden.

08:26.709 --> 08:29.125
You have to be completely off the grid.

08:29.208 --> 08:31.208
That's why I confiscated your cell phones.

08:39.208 --> 08:42.041
Jerry, did you hide your phone in the cow?

08:42.125 --> 08:43.709
Yes, I did.

08:44.333 --> 08:45.750
Why did you do that?

08:45.834 --> 08:48.041
Oh, 'cause the sheep
got really bad reception.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.333
Well, there you are!

08:52.417 --> 08:54.083
My new farmhands.

08:54.166 --> 08:56.166
My name's Farmer Pratchett,

08:56.250 --> 08:58.875

08:58.959 --> 09:01.625
Oh, well, hello, Jebidiah.

09:01.917 --> 09:04.625
I'm... Rudimiah.

09:04.709 --> 09:06.250

09:36.667 --> 09:39.500

09:39.583 --> 09:40.917

Oh, here we go. "Milk the cow."

09:44.625 --> 09:47.125

Well, I'm glad you're here.

09:50.208 --> 09:53.166
It's, uh, it's just me

09:53.333 --> 09:55.333
We had a tough harvest last year.

09:55.583 --> 09:58.792
Had to sell my beloved plow horse,
Charlie.

09:59.417 --> 10:01.375
He had a beautiful mane.

<i>Hmm.</i>

10:03.208 --> 10:04.458
You know what?

10:04.792 --> 10:06.709
You kinda remind me of my Charlie.

10:09.417 --> 10:10.875
Yes.

10:11.792 --> 10:13.709
How 'bout a sugar cube, boy?

10:13.792 --> 10:15.208
No, I'm good--

10:15.291 --> 10:17.083
That's a good boy.

10:26.083 --> 10:28.625
That cow does not like being milked.

10:28.917 --> 10:30.333
That's a bull.

10:31.709 --> 10:33.625
This is gonna be harder than I thought.

10:37.917 --> 10:41.250
Now, this is the most important job
on the farm,

10:41.333 --> 10:44.542
protecting my vegetables from the birds.

10:46.083 --> 10:47.792
Holy Christmas nuts!

10:47.875 --> 10:50.166
Look at the size of that gourd!

10:50.250 --> 10:51.750
That's not just a gourd.

10:51.834 --> 10:55.458
That squash is gonna win
this year's state fair.

10:55.583 --> 10:57.667
I call her sas-squash.

10:57.917 --> 11:00.291
Ohh, I get it. 'Cause she's so big.

11:00.375 --> 11:01.583
She's like sasquatch.

11:01.917 --> 11:02.959
Who?

11:04.917 --> 11:07.250
Well, I can see why you chose me.

11:07.458 --> 11:09.333
I'm smart, courageous,

11:09.375 --> 11:10.792
and trustworthy.

11:10.875 --> 11:12.375
That and, uh, well,

11:12.375 --> 11:14.333
you've got a face made for scaring.

11:16.792 --> 11:17.709
Good luck.

11:17.792 --> 11:18.709
I don't need it.

11:18.792 --> 11:20.917
This is gonna be a breeze.

11:29.166 --> 11:31.208
Oh-ho.

11:31.709 --> 11:34.125
I see you up there, crow.

11:34.667 --> 11:36.000
Licking your beak.

11:36.083 --> 11:38.125
Well, it's not gonna happen on my watch.

11:38.208 --> 11:39.250
Keep moving!

11:40.500 --> 11:42.083
That's right, fly away.

11:42.166 --> 11:43.291
Ahh...

11:46.625 --> 11:48.959
Oh, no. Oh, oh, you're coming back.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.166
<i>-
- And you're bringing your friends...</i>

11:51.250 --> 11:52.625
And a bald eagle.

11:52.709 --> 11:54.500
Oh, no, no.

11:54.583 --> 11:56.417
No, no, no. Oh, oh!

11:56.500 --> 11:58.250
Oh! Ow!

12:00.166 --> 12:01.709
Who's pecking?

12:19.375 --> 12:20.417
Oh.

12:20.959 --> 12:22.750
Oh, sas-squash.

12:22.834 --> 12:24.709
You never had a chance.

12:27.792 --> 12:30.458
You animals!

12:30.583 --> 12:33.625
If you ever come back again,

12:33.709 --> 12:35.875
- you're gonna feel the wrath--
<i>-</i>

12:35.959 --> 12:37.417
Better get out of here.

12:41.417 --> 12:42.750
Your job is simple.

12:42.834 --> 12:46.500
Just use this rope
to stack those bales up there.

12:46.583 --> 12:48.458
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down.

12:48.542 --> 12:50.458
Okay? Ropes, bales, up--

12:50.542 --> 12:52.625
Lot of moving parts here, Pratchett.

12:52.709 --> 12:54.583
I don't care how you do it.

12:54.667 --> 12:56.375
Just get that hay...

12:58.041 --> 13:00.166
- up there.
-

13:08.959 --> 13:10.625
I've been watching you.

13:12.166 --> 13:13.834
You're different.

13:15.291 --> 13:17.208
I get that a lot.

13:17.375 --> 13:19.542
You're not from around here, are you?

13:19.709 --> 13:20.709
You can tell me.

13:21.542 --> 13:22.875
Actually, I'm from the city.

13:23.959 --> 13:27.250
Did you ever ride
on those magical moving stairs?

13:28.125 --> 13:29.250
You mean an escalator?

13:29.375 --> 13:32.917
Oh, how you talk!

13:33.667 --> 13:35.959
I was in the city once
selling eggs with Paul

13:36.041 --> 13:38.000
and I saw someone eating one of those...

13:38.417 --> 13:40.542
red sauce devil pies.

13:40.875 --> 13:42.083
You mean a pizza?

13:43.917 --> 13:44.917
Pizza!

13:45.291 --> 13:47.917
I've never said a word with a "Z" in it.

13:49.583 --> 13:51.083
You know, I can, uh...

13:51.375 --> 13:54.125
Order one of those on my...

13:54.250 --> 13:55.208
cell phone.

13:55.291 --> 13:56.792
No, you cannot.

13:56.875 --> 13:58.333
No-- Whoa!

14:00.750 --> 14:02.917
Oh, hi, yeah.
I'd like to order a delivery, please.

14:03.875 --> 14:06.625
419 Prairie Way,

14:06.959 --> 14:09.250
Homesdale.

14:09.834 --> 14:12.250
Hacking into their phones was brilliant.

14:12.917 --> 14:17.709
I think it's time
the Blade makes a little pizza delivery.

14:20.208 --> 14:21.667
Thank you.

14:22.792 --> 14:24.083
Been a pleasure.

14:26.125 --> 14:27.750
Ooh, still warm and damp.

14:27.834 --> 14:29.792
Gross, but thank you.

14:31.125 --> 14:33.125
Okay, last house on the block.

14:34.333 --> 14:35.166
Ow!

14:35.250 --> 14:37.458
A chicken just pecked me.

14:37.542 --> 14:39.834
Yeah, because you don't know
what you're doing, Kim.

14:39.917 --> 14:42.125
You can't just shove your hand
in there and get all grabby.

14:42.208 --> 14:43.792
You have to just-- Ow!

14:46.500 --> 14:48.583
Let her keep her stupid egg.
Come on, let's get out of here.

14:48.667 --> 14:51.125
We can't. Okay, Pratchett said
if we leave a single egg,

14:51.208 --> 14:52.709
they'll get lazy and stop laying.

14:53.125 --> 14:54.500
I got it. Okay.

14:54.583 --> 14:57.333
You act like a rooster, draw her out,
and I'll grab the egg.

14:57.417 --> 14:58.625
Kim, I'm not acting like--

14:58.709 --> 15:00.041
A handsome rooster.

15:00.542 --> 15:01.834
That I can do.

15:12.125 --> 15:15.083
Aww, Jack, look! It's working, she's out.

15:19.250 --> 15:20.208
I can't find the egg.

15:20.291 --> 15:21.709
Put your head in and look for it.

15:23.750 --> 15:25.333
Yeah, I think I see it.

15:25.750 --> 15:28.000
- Ow!
<i>-</i>

15:34.166 --> 15:36.000
I think there may be
another chicken in there.

15:36.792 --> 15:38.083
Ya think?

15:41.041 --> 15:42.041
Wait.

15:43.041 --> 15:44.375
Where'd she go?

15:51.291 --> 15:52.834
- Ohh!
-

15:59.750 --> 16:02.333
Ha! You thought you were gonna get us,

16:02.375 --> 16:03.709
but you didn't. You know why?

16:03.792 --> 16:07.333
'Cause you and your little chicken brain
were no match for me and my--

16:07.417 --> 16:08.500
What?

16:08.583 --> 16:10.250
Whoa! Help me!

16:22.583 --> 16:23.625
What happened to you?

16:23.709 --> 16:26.000
I got baled and barreled.
What happened to you?

16:26.083 --> 16:27.875
We got pecked and feathered.

16:27.959 --> 16:29.291
What happened to you?

16:29.375 --> 16:31.041
I got crowed and eagled.

16:31.959 --> 16:33.417
What it do, farm friends?

16:33.500 --> 16:35.709
Whoo!

16:36.166 --> 16:37.375
That's my girl.

16:37.458 --> 16:38.792
You're finally here.

16:38.875 --> 16:40.583
Everybody get back to work.

16:40.709 --> 16:42.250
We've got jobs to do.

16:44.542 --> 16:45.625
What's going on here?

16:46.458 --> 16:47.750
Who are you people?

16:47.834 --> 16:49.542
Because you sure aren't farmers.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.208
You're right.

16:51.458 --> 16:53.625
You deserve the truth. We're a--

16:53.709 --> 16:55.834
We are a mariachi band.

16:55.917 --> 16:58.250
And I am Señorita Rosa.

16:58.333 --> 17:00.000
- Milton.
- Shut it, Jorge.

17:00.083 --> 17:02.917
After I had to sell my horse, Charlie,

17:03.000 --> 17:05.125
I didn't think things could get any worse.

17:06.083 --> 17:09.166
But you all have destroyed my barn.

17:10.792 --> 17:12.000
That's all right, pal.

17:12.917 --> 17:14.500
Now I'm gonna destroy them.

17:14.792 --> 17:16.834
Benny? How did you find us?

17:16.917 --> 17:18.083
It was easy.

17:18.166 --> 17:20.291
I just waited for someone
to use their phone.

17:20.542 --> 17:23.125
Pizza delivery for Jerry Martinez.

17:23.208 --> 17:24.959
Oh. That's me.

17:26.125 --> 17:28.083
Yeah, well, you took more
than 30 minutes to deliver it,

17:28.166 --> 17:29.875
which means I don't have to pay.

17:29.959 --> 17:30.959
Thank you.

17:31.583 --> 17:33.500
I wanna know what's going on around here.

17:33.583 --> 17:35.041
Whoa!
- Get 'em!

18:31.625 --> 18:34.000
Chappy Chapman? What are you doing here?

18:34.083 --> 18:35.875
It's called sweet revenge, missy.

18:41.166 --> 18:42.375
You!

18:44.917 --> 18:47.375
Nobody hits Chappy Chapman and his hair.

18:49.875 --> 18:52.417
<i>This Chappy Chapman live
from the Pratchett Farm.</i>

18:52.500 --> 18:53.750
<i>Back to you, Brittny.</i>

19:00.083 --> 19:03.250
Benny and his boys are going away
for a long time,

19:03.333 --> 19:05.125
thanks to you and your friends, Rudy.

19:06.959 --> 19:08.291
I'm mighty impressed

19:08.375 --> 19:11.458
that you were brave enough to stand up
to a fellow like Benny.

19:12.083 --> 19:13.792
You might not be good farmers,

19:14.208 --> 19:16.166
but you're good people.

19:16.500 --> 19:18.417
And you're welcome on my farm anytime.

19:21.625 --> 19:22.542

- Nope.

19:22.625 --> 19:24.291
- Let's go.
- No way.

19:27.792 --> 19:29.917
Uh, Mr. Farmer Pratchett, sir?

19:30.000 --> 19:31.458
I have something to say.

19:31.709 --> 19:33.375
In the short time that I've been here,

19:33.458 --> 19:35.875
I've developed feelings for Lily and...

19:36.250 --> 19:38.250
I would like to ask
for your permission to be her...

19:38.333 --> 19:39.333
Yeah?

19:41.875 --> 19:44.250
...be her pen pal. See ya, Lily. Write me.

you're here to help.

19:56.375 --> 19:59.417

We couldn't think of a better way
to spend our reward money.

20:10.291 --> 20:13.375
How 'bout a sugar cube, Charlie? Huh?

20:13.458 --> 20:15.750
Aww, that's my good boy.

20:16.166 --> 20:18.208
I remember when I was his good boy.

20:20.917 --> 20:21.959
Hey.

20:22.208 --> 20:24.625
This bale of hay should be at the top
of the stack.

20:25.834 --> 20:27.709
I'm on it.

20:49.583 --> 20:50.625
We're good.

20:52.583 --> 20:56.500
Look what I found out in the pumpkin patch

20:56.583 --> 20:58.333
under some leaves.

20:58.750 --> 21:00.083
Whoa!

21:00.166 --> 21:02.500
She's guaranteed to win first prize

21:02.583 --> 21:04.125

21:04.208 --> 21:06.709
Jerry, you're stacking the hay too high.

21:06.792 --> 21:09.250
Kim, I know how to stack the-- Uh-oh.

21:15.750 --> 21:18.291
You know, to beat traffic,
we should probably get going.

21:18.375 --> 21:20.166
- Take care. Thank you.
- Yeah.

21:25.333 --> 21:26.667
Good luck at the fair, man.
