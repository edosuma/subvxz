WEBVTT

00:00.866 --> 00:02.799
Previously on Nancy Drew...

00:02.800 --> 00:05.047
ACE: Lucy Sable
was crowned Sea Queen,

00:05.048 --> 00:06.006
disappeared after the celebration,

00:06.049 --> 00:07.137
never seen again.

00:07.181 --> 00:08.312
NANCY:
Something happened to her

00:08.356 --> 00:10.271
at the Velvet Masque
20 years ago.

00:10.314 --> 00:11.402
How did they handle it?

00:11.446 --> 00:12.577
Carson Drew.

00:12.621 --> 00:14.057
NANCY:
What's the dress of a girl

00:14.101 --> 00:16.755
who was murdered 20 years ago
doing in my attic?

00:16.799 --> 00:18.627
Tiffany was murdered.

00:18.670 --> 00:20.542
And I'm gonna prove it.

00:20.585 --> 00:22.761
I have these
antique Roman coins.

00:22.805 --> 00:24.372
It's the most valuable
thing that I own.

00:24.415 --> 00:26.417
The coins could prove
the Hudsons are complicit in,

00:26.461 --> 00:28.376
like, a dozen murders.

00:36.079 --> 00:38.734
CHILDREN:
Lucy Sable once was able

00:38.777 --> 00:42.303
to look upon the sea.
NANCY: In the hours after being crowned,

00:42.346 --> 00:44.827
Horseshoe Bay's
most infamous Sea Queen

00:44.870 --> 00:47.090
made her way to the bluffs.

00:47.134 --> 00:49.353
[screaming] All we know of the killer

00:49.397 --> 00:51.312
are the bloody knife
and tire tracks

00:51.355 --> 00:54.532
they left behind.

00:54.576 --> 00:57.361
CHILDREN:
Now that's where she'll always be.

00:57.405 --> 00:59.407
NANCY:
But why is that all we know?

00:59.450 --> 01:01.148
Maybe the town
didn't want to face

01:01.191 --> 01:04.977
that the killer could've been
one of us.

01:05.021 --> 01:09.156
Denial. Small Town USA's
favorite pastime.

01:11.375 --> 01:14.117
Lucy Sable's murder
has been reduced to

01:14.161 --> 01:15.640
a nursery rhyme.

01:15.684 --> 01:18.165
But now we know
there's more to it.

01:18.208 --> 01:21.820
Her death is linked
to Tiffany's.

01:21.864 --> 01:24.084
That's what she was trying
to tell me at the Velvet Masque.

01:24.127 --> 01:26.999
We have to solve Lucy's murder
in order to solve Tiffany's.

01:27.043 --> 01:29.176
Yeah, but how are
the two murders linked?

01:29.219 --> 01:30.612
ACE:
They both learned things

01:30.655 --> 01:32.396
about the Hudsons that could've
gotten them killed.

01:32.440 --> 01:34.659
Tiffany found out
about the Hudsons

01:34.703 --> 01:36.313
sinking the Bonny Scot,

01:36.357 --> 01:38.359
and the coins we stole
at the Velvet Masque.

01:38.402 --> 01:40.361
Luckily, the coins
proved what they did.

01:40.404 --> 01:42.667
And Lucy found out
that Celia Hudson

01:42.711 --> 01:46.149
was having an affair with
her husband's business rival.

01:46.193 --> 01:48.325
And then, less than a year
later, she was murdered.

01:48.369 --> 01:50.458
[footfalls approach]Oh, uh,

01:50.501 --> 01:52.938
let me help. Get your hands off my chest.

01:52.982 --> 01:55.289
These tables aren't gonna
set themselves.

01:55.332 --> 01:56.986
Okay, George, I get it.
I ditched you

01:57.029 --> 01:58.988
to go to an underground,
depraved, rich-people party.

01:59.031 --> 02:01.121
[phone ringing]

02:03.775 --> 02:05.299
Hey, I can't talk right now.

02:05.342 --> 02:07.083
This is a bad time.

02:07.127 --> 02:08.519
I'm in the middle of something.

02:08.563 --> 02:11.218
McGINNIS:
Too bad. I didn't make a deal for silence.

02:11.261 --> 02:13.524
And I know you and your friends
have been busy

02:13.568 --> 02:16.266
crashing exclusive parties.

02:16.310 --> 02:17.833
So what did you find out there?

02:17.876 --> 02:19.356
ACE:
Yeah, I may have found

02:19.400 --> 02:21.576
a lead on the Hudsons.

02:21.619 --> 02:23.404
Um, I'll call you back.
[door opens, bell jingles]

02:23.447 --> 02:25.362
Promise.

02:25.406 --> 02:28.191
Hey, you.
Hey.

02:35.894 --> 02:38.201
Why'd you leave so
early last night?

02:38.245 --> 02:40.203
Uh, you were convincing
Owen Marvin not

02:40.247 --> 02:41.378
to come after
the Roman burial coins

02:41.422 --> 02:44.686
he paid $1.5 million for.

02:44.729 --> 02:47.297
Figured you'd be a while.
GEORGE: Hey, Nick.

02:47.341 --> 02:50.213
One sugar, splash of milk.
Right? Yeah.

02:50.257 --> 02:51.388
Thanks, George.

02:55.697 --> 02:57.786
Between Laura Tandy breaking in

02:57.829 --> 02:59.918
and the cops searching my place,

02:59.962 --> 03:02.269
no way I'm leaving them at home.

03:02.312 --> 03:04.880
So, what do we do
with the coins now?

03:04.923 --> 03:06.447
Oh, we turn them
into the authorities,

03:06.490 --> 03:08.231
They could prove the Hudsons

03:08.275 --> 03:11.191
sank their own ship and killed
their crew for insurance money.

03:11.234 --> 03:13.802
There's an FBI agent we can trust in Portland.
GEORGE: Really?

03:13.845 --> 03:16.326
And how do you suddenly
know about this person?

03:16.370 --> 03:18.023
NANCY:
He's friends with Owen.

03:18.067 --> 03:20.243
We can bring him the coins
and the toxicology report

03:20.287 --> 03:22.245
on Tiffany's blood as soon as
I get the results back

03:22.289 --> 03:24.204
from John Sander. Your scientist friend?

03:24.247 --> 03:25.988
The one who found
somebody else's hair?

03:26.031 --> 03:28.251
Yeah, the... a woman's hair.

03:28.295 --> 03:29.687
You think it's
Celia Hudson's hair?

03:29.731 --> 03:32.081
Uh, I did at first.
But after a little

03:32.124 --> 03:35.040
Internet digging, I found the
society pages from August 2000.

03:35.084 --> 03:38.087
Turns out, Celia
was in Argentina

03:38.130 --> 03:39.175
when Lucy was killed.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.177
That a solid alibi? Not for somebody

03:41.221 --> 03:42.265
who had the means
to hire a hit man.

03:42.309 --> 03:43.266
[door opens, bell jingles]

They're here.

03:47.139 --> 03:48.271
They're here, they're out there.

03:50.186 --> 03:51.274
GEORGE: Mom?
[gasps]

03:51.318 --> 03:53.363
Who's... out there?

03:53.407 --> 03:55.235
[whispering]:
Spirits. Dark forces.

03:55.278 --> 03:57.367
Something is drawing them here.
I can feel it.

03:57.411 --> 03:59.587
You want to sit down? Those.

03:59.630 --> 04:01.153
Get rid of them right now.

04:01.197 --> 04:03.243
Why? Because they're magnets.

04:03.286 --> 04:04.461
Catnip for the dead

04:04.505 --> 04:05.984
and for things that were
never even alive.

04:06.028 --> 04:07.769
What do you mean, things
that were never even alive?

04:07.812 --> 04:09.031
You don't want to know.

04:09.074 --> 04:10.641
Just put them into whatever
lead-lined box

04:10.685 --> 04:13.165
was obviously protecting them
and throw them into the sea.

04:13.209 --> 04:14.776
Victoria, how many
drinks have you had?

04:14.819 --> 04:16.473
I'm telling you
they were out there!

04:16.517 --> 04:17.822
[panting]

04:17.866 --> 04:20.129
They're gone, but, no,

04:20.172 --> 04:21.173
they were...

04:21.217 --> 04:24.264
They were out there.
[gasps]

Oh, God!

04:27.223 --> 04:29.312
Victoria, are you okay?

04:29.356 --> 04:31.967
[panting]:
Get rid of those coins.

04:34.578 --> 04:36.754
♪ ♪

04:46.242 --> 04:48.244
We have to listen to Victoria
and get rid of the coins.

04:48.288 --> 04:50.812
Nick is gone, and he took
the coins with him,

04:50.855 --> 04:52.596
and he's gonna put them
in a box that will hopefully

04:52.640 --> 04:54.772
block the spirits
from sniffing them out.

04:54.816 --> 04:56.774
For now.
No.

04:56.818 --> 04:58.123
GEORGE:
Come on.

04:58.167 --> 04:59.429
Get back to work.

04:59.473 --> 05:01.475
You were the one
who kicked the blood bucket

05:01.518 --> 05:02.650
and got possessed.

05:02.693 --> 05:04.826
You of all people
should believe Victoria.

05:04.869 --> 05:06.175
I never said
I didn't believe her,

05:06.218 --> 05:07.829
but cowering in the kitchen
won't pay the bills.

05:07.872 --> 05:10.440
Can't Owen just bring us
the lead box

05:10.484 --> 05:11.615
that kept the ghosts away?

05:11.659 --> 05:12.877
I can't get ahold of him.

05:12.921 --> 05:14.531
He's in Singapore on business,

05:14.575 --> 05:16.794
and I don't know
when he'll be back.

05:16.838 --> 05:18.361
ACE:
Oh. This website says

05:18.405 --> 05:22.017
the coins, they're working in
overdrive, attracting spirits

05:22.060 --> 05:23.323
'cause of the new moon rising.

05:23.366 --> 05:25.673
Great.
ACE: And they're more than catnip.

05:25.716 --> 05:27.370
If used properly tonight,

05:27.414 --> 05:29.459
those coins will be like
tokens for a pay phone

05:29.503 --> 05:31.331
that calls to the other side.

05:31.374 --> 05:35.117
George. I need to take
a 20-minute break.

05:35.160 --> 05:37.467
I need to get the coins
from Nick and talk to Victoria.

05:37.511 --> 05:39.730
We just opened.

05:39.774 --> 05:42.124

05:42.167 --> 05:44.561
NANCY:
Hmm. Fatherly check-in.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.609
CARSON: Hi.
Hey. You're back.

05:48.652 --> 05:51.394
I thought maybe you extended
your Boston business trip.

05:51.438 --> 05:54.223
Oh, I got... hung up meeting
with a friend this morning.

05:54.266 --> 05:56.356
I wanted to ask you,

05:56.399 --> 05:59.489
how would you feel about
starting family dinners again?

05:59.533 --> 06:01.796
Tonight? Family dinners?

06:01.839 --> 06:03.319
It won't be the same, I know.

06:03.363 --> 06:06.496
But... I figure we could
give it a shot.

06:06.540 --> 06:08.585
I could pick up some steaks
after work.

06:08.629 --> 06:11.240
Work. As in working
for Ryan Hudson?

06:11.283 --> 06:12.459
Celia Hudson.

06:12.502 --> 06:14.461
Just a minor favor.
Oh. So you're doing

06:14.504 --> 06:16.463
favors for the whole family now?

06:16.506 --> 06:19.248
I'm returning
the favor, actually.

06:19.291 --> 06:21.076
It turns out Celia was the one

06:21.119 --> 06:23.426
who gave Ryan the money
to bail you out.

06:23.470 --> 06:26.908
Of course she did.

06:26.951 --> 06:29.084
I will see you at family dinner.

06:33.393 --> 06:35.612
NICK: Mr. Lingley still owes us
for the last repair.

06:35.656 --> 06:37.179
Yeah, but he's good for it.

06:38.963 --> 06:42.227
Uh... would you mind
giving us a second, Josh?

06:44.708 --> 06:45.840
Take your time.

06:45.883 --> 06:47.755
Thanks.

06:49.365 --> 06:51.149
What's up?

06:51.193 --> 06:53.761
You tell me.

06:53.804 --> 06:56.241
Why does it feel like
we're on different teams?

06:56.285 --> 06:59.984
[chuckles] Nancy, you're the one
that never tells me anything.
That's...

07:00.028 --> 07:01.856
not true. I just don't
tell you everything.

07:01.899 --> 07:05.468
Well, maybe that's why it feels
like we're on different teams.

07:09.254 --> 07:11.213
Okay.

07:12.693 --> 07:13.737
Not a lead box,

07:13.781 --> 07:16.261
but it'll do for now.

07:17.306 --> 07:19.351
So we can drive down to Portland

07:19.395 --> 07:21.441
and give these
to Owen's FBI friend.

07:22.224 --> 07:25.183
That sounds great.
When we're ready.

07:25.227 --> 07:27.969
I was just kind of hoping
we could hold onto these

07:28.012 --> 07:29.449
for a little bit longer.

07:29.492 --> 07:31.581
Give me one very quick second.

07:35.237 --> 07:37.587
Hey, George, um, I was just
wondering if you knew

07:37.631 --> 07:39.328
where your mom might be?

07:39.371 --> 07:41.199
I wanted to ask her...

07:41.243 --> 07:43.114
She what?

07:45.334 --> 07:46.596
How have you
already been arrested

07:46.640 --> 07:49.251
for public intoxication?
It's 11:00 a.m.

07:49.294 --> 07:50.774
Drinking's the only thing
that stops me

07:50.818 --> 07:52.080
from seeing those things.

07:52.123 --> 07:54.038
Officer Rawley,
it is my understanding that

07:54.082 --> 07:55.300
a drunk and disorderly arrest

07:55.344 --> 07:56.476
requires clear
and obvious signs...

07:56.519 --> 07:57.912
[chuckling]:
Calm down, Nancy.

07:57.955 --> 07:59.043
My guys didn't arrest her.
VICTORIA: Only because

07:59.087 --> 08:02.525
you don't know how
to do your job!

08:02.569 --> 08:04.092
She walked in here
20 minutes ago

08:04.135 --> 08:05.528
and fell asleep on that bench.

08:05.572 --> 08:07.530
You're trying to get arrested?

08:07.574 --> 08:12.056
Look. This precinct... is
the least haunted building

08:12.100 --> 08:13.667
in Horseshoe Bay, and, uh...

08:13.710 --> 08:17.540
Okay, and you know what? And as
long as those coins are out,

08:17.584 --> 08:18.976
exposed and unprotected...

08:19.020 --> 08:20.978
We can get rid of the coins.

08:21.022 --> 08:24.199
As long as you help us
figure out

08:24.242 --> 08:25.809
how to communicate
with Dead Lucy.

08:25.853 --> 08:26.984
Dead Lucy?

08:27.028 --> 08:29.465
She's haunting Nancy.
Just go with it.

08:29.509 --> 08:30.858
Lucy only comes around
when she wants to,

08:30.901 --> 08:33.295
and even when she does,
I can't figure out

08:33.338 --> 08:34.818
what she wants, so if we can...

08:34.862 --> 08:36.951
I-if I can call on her,

08:36.994 --> 08:39.867
if-if-if I can use
the coins to focus her enough

08:39.910 --> 08:42.652
to ask her questions...
There are way worse things

08:42.696 --> 08:44.393
out there, and they are
attracted to those coins

08:44.436 --> 08:46.656
like magnets. We're
talking inhuman entities,

08:46.700 --> 08:48.223
pure evil.

08:48.266 --> 08:51.052
These were the things
that were never even alive? Yes.

08:51.095 --> 08:54.316
So then you can
keep us safe. Us? You want to do this, too?

08:54.359 --> 08:56.057
Of course not. But solving
Lucy's murder

08:56.100 --> 08:57.101
would help us solve Tiffany's

08:57.145 --> 08:58.059
and get us off
that suspect list.

08:58.102 --> 08:59.930
[sighs]:
Oh.

08:59.974 --> 09:01.366
I mean, if you don't know
howto use the coins,

09:01.410 --> 09:02.759
then I guess we'll just
figure it out on our own.

09:02.803 --> 09:04.413
It's not just the coins.

09:04.456 --> 09:06.154
You would need an object
that Lucy touched

09:06.197 --> 09:07.547
the night she died.

09:07.590 --> 09:08.983
It would be the only thing
strong enough for her

09:09.026 --> 09:10.158
to latch onto if you
were to summon her.

09:10.201 --> 09:13.422
Say I acquire said object.
Then what?

09:13.465 --> 09:14.771
We would have to do it tonight.

09:14.815 --> 09:16.904
Because the coins work best
with the new moon.

09:16.947 --> 09:18.558
Thank you. Don't thank me.

09:18.601 --> 09:21.691
Conducting a séance with a force
as powerful as those coins

09:21.735 --> 09:23.432
will probably end up
in disaster.

09:23.475 --> 09:25.173
Well, that's never
stopped me before.

09:34.269 --> 09:37.489
Here you go. Our finest fried clams.

09:37.533 --> 09:39.491
You can barely taste the clam.

09:39.535 --> 09:42.190
Oh... it's good.

09:42.233 --> 09:47.151
Thank you so much, John.
I really appreciate the rush.

09:47.195 --> 09:50.328
Okay, so John Sander will
messenger Lucy's crown

09:50.372 --> 09:51.591
and hair for us to use
in the séance tonight

09:51.634 --> 09:52.766
when he gets to his lab.

09:52.809 --> 09:55.159
So, all we need is,
like, a spirit board?

09:55.203 --> 09:56.639
This isn't the 1800s.

09:56.683 --> 09:59.381
Nancy, how has Dead Lucy
been communicating with you?

09:59.424 --> 10:03.385
My cell phone, light
bulbs, TV, DVD...

10:03.428 --> 10:05.213
Electronics. So we should use

10:05.256 --> 10:06.388
an electronic device
for her to speak to us.

10:06.431 --> 10:07.389
BESS:
Yes, but Dead Lucy

10:07.432 --> 10:09.173
has never spoken aloud to you.

10:09.217 --> 10:11.393
Well, then, we ask yes
or no questions only.

10:11.436 --> 10:13.525
And make them good. We only
have a short window of time

10:13.569 --> 10:14.744
to keep the spirit door open.

10:14.788 --> 10:16.790
BESS:
And if we do keep it open?

10:16.833 --> 10:20.358
Well, then we'd allow the
darkest forces to come through.

10:20.402 --> 10:22.273
So we get in and we get out.

10:22.317 --> 10:24.275
ACE:
Yes. I'm in.

10:29.585 --> 10:33.371
Really? You hacked into the
Horseshoe Bay digital library?

10:33.415 --> 10:37.071
Sort of.
I used my library card.

10:37.114 --> 10:38.855
Why are hacking
into the library?

10:38.899 --> 10:41.815
To access Lucy's Sea Queen
ceremony video.

10:41.858 --> 10:43.643
If we trace her final hours,
we might be able to figure out

10:43.686 --> 10:44.948
which questions
we want to ask her.

10:44.992 --> 10:47.211
ACE:
Taking it back to the year 2000.

10:47.255 --> 10:49.866
This year's Horseshoe Bay...
GEORGE: Wow, that's Lucy?

10:49.910 --> 10:52.303
...Sea Queen winner is...
She was so beautiful.

10:52.347 --> 10:54.436
...Lucy Sable!

10:54.479 --> 10:56.481
[applause]

11:09.756 --> 11:12.454
Did that girl just tell Lucy
she killed her dog or something?

11:12.497 --> 11:14.369
NANCY:
What do we know
about the first runner-up?

11:16.414 --> 11:18.503
ACE:
Candice Weaver is her name.

11:18.547 --> 11:20.331
Do we think she still
lives in Horseshoe Bay?

11:20.375 --> 11:22.420
All Sea Queen runner-ups
still live in Horseshoe Bay.

11:22.464 --> 11:23.508
Oh.

11:23.552 --> 11:24.945
[computer chimes]

11:32.430 --> 11:33.823
[George gasps]

11:35.520 --> 11:37.305
Oh, my God.

11:37.348 --> 11:40.743
Ooh, looks like Laura Tandy
went on a one-woman campaign

11:40.787 --> 11:42.223
against the police.

11:42.266 --> 11:44.312
How pissed do you think
McGinnis is gonna be

11:44.355 --> 11:45.879
when he sees that?[phone buzzes]

11:45.922 --> 11:47.228
[laughs]

11:47.271 --> 11:51.319
Oh, my God.

Hey, Nick, I need an
oil change. Help me out?

12:18.389 --> 12:20.000
I, uh...

12:20.043 --> 12:22.480
saw your publicity stunt.

12:22.524 --> 12:23.699
Not bad.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.005
Thanks.

12:25.048 --> 12:26.397
Is that what you've
been doing all week?

12:26.441 --> 12:28.269
That, and giving you time
to dig into my sister's

12:28.312 --> 12:29.749
USB drive, like you asked.

12:29.792 --> 12:31.838
So? I haven't found anything yet.

12:31.881 --> 12:33.840
And if I remember correctly,

12:33.883 --> 12:34.928
your sister didn't
want you involved

12:34.971 --> 12:36.625
with what was on that drive.

12:36.668 --> 12:39.019
Come on, Nick, you want to prove
the Hudsons killed Tiffany

12:39.062 --> 12:40.934
almost as much as I do.
Let me help.

12:40.977 --> 12:43.327
[scoffs]
Aren't you the one who
played Tiffany's 911 call

12:43.371 --> 12:45.025
at her funeral?

12:45.068 --> 12:46.809
I'm a loose cannon,
I know, but I... Once I finish going

12:46.853 --> 12:48.898
through the drive,
I'll fill you in, okay?

12:48.942 --> 12:51.118
Fine. Be that way.

12:51.161 --> 12:53.729
Just let me know
when my car is ready.

12:56.819 --> 12:59.822
NANCY: Candice, I was reviewing
your Sea Queen

12:59.866 --> 13:00.910
ceremony footage.

13:00.954 --> 13:03.347
You looked beautiful,
by the way.

13:03.391 --> 13:06.524
You're so sweet.
[all chuckle]

13:06.568 --> 13:09.919
So, what can you tell us
about the moment

13:09.963 --> 13:11.138
of winning runner-up?

13:11.181 --> 13:13.401
Um, runner-up isn't
really winning.

13:13.444 --> 13:15.838
Hey, you wanted your Sea Queen
blog to be accurate, right?

13:15.882 --> 13:16.839
It's just that,

13:16.883 --> 13:18.406
when I watched the video,

13:18.449 --> 13:21.191
I noticed that you
whispered something

13:21.235 --> 13:23.411
into Lucy's ear after
she had been crowned.

13:23.454 --> 13:26.283
I was merely telling her
that there are rumors

13:26.327 --> 13:29.243
about how friendly she'd
gotten with the judges

13:29.286 --> 13:31.854
and many other influential men.

13:31.898 --> 13:32.855
You called her a slut.

13:32.899 --> 13:36.424
Lucy liked to party.

13:36.467 --> 13:39.949
Poor girl, she was always
starved for attention.

13:39.993 --> 13:42.125
Attention that you
should've been getting?

13:42.169 --> 13:44.649
I'm sorry, is this all
part of my interview

13:44.693 --> 13:47.261
for the Sea Queen blog,
or am I missing something?

13:47.304 --> 13:48.740
Oh, trust me,
you're missing something.

13:48.784 --> 13:51.569
I remember doing that.

13:51.613 --> 13:53.397
Back from when I was Sea Queen.

13:53.441 --> 13:55.704
The ribbon-cutting ceremony
with the mayor.

13:55.747 --> 13:58.489
Did Lucy ask you
to take over for her?

13:58.533 --> 14:00.056
I had to step in.

14:00.100 --> 14:02.493
She had already gone MIA
with her little brother.

14:02.537 --> 14:04.321
Did her brother ever explain
where they went?

14:04.365 --> 14:06.280
Her brother and mom moved away
a few weeks after

14:06.323 --> 14:09.457
everything happened, and no one
ever heard from them again.

14:09.500 --> 14:11.372
Wait, but this picture isn't
in the library catalog.

14:11.415 --> 14:13.722
Well, that's because
it was never published.

14:13.765 --> 14:16.594
Lucy's death overshadowed
all things Sea Queen

14:16.638 --> 14:18.901
that were supposedto be
published the next day.

14:18.945 --> 14:21.208
I had to beg
the Horseshoe Bay Ledger

14:21.251 --> 14:23.166
to give me a copy
of what was supposed to be

14:23.210 --> 14:24.907
front-page news.

14:24.951 --> 14:26.387
Wait, the Ledgerhas more
Sea Queen photos from that day?

14:26.430 --> 14:29.520
Oh, yeah.
More than I could frame.

14:31.958 --> 14:33.960
[sighs]

14:34.003 --> 14:36.527
Hey, Ponyboy.

14:36.571 --> 14:38.834
Hi.
Hi.

14:41.271 --> 14:43.230
Mmm.

14:43.273 --> 14:46.494
Do you use some sort of,
like, softening shampoo?

14:46.537 --> 14:47.799
What's wrong?

14:47.843 --> 14:49.453
I'm bummed you don't trust me.

14:49.497 --> 14:51.412
Why not tell me about
your publicity blitz?

14:51.455 --> 14:53.327
Because I thought you would
try and stop me.

14:53.370 --> 14:55.329
We are on the same side, Laura.

14:55.372 --> 14:56.678
I know we are.

14:56.721 --> 14:58.593
Then tell me why Tiffany
didn't want you to know

14:58.636 --> 14:59.811
what was on that drive.

15:02.249 --> 15:03.293
How'd you even know
where to find it

15:03.337 --> 15:04.773
when you stole it from Nick?

15:04.816 --> 15:07.210
Because we were super close.
Tiffany told me everything.

15:07.254 --> 15:09.996
So close you sued her.

15:10.039 --> 15:12.476
I took an Internet stroll
this morning.

15:12.520 --> 15:13.913
Public record.

15:13.956 --> 15:15.740
After our parents died,
Tiffany was put in charge

15:15.784 --> 15:18.439
of my inheritance,
till I turned 25.

15:18.482 --> 15:20.658
I wanted the money sooner,
so I sued her.

15:20.702 --> 15:22.486
It's what sisters do.

15:22.530 --> 15:24.227
Rich sisters.

15:24.271 --> 15:26.447
But I didn't love her any less.

15:26.490 --> 15:28.492
She was all I had.

15:28.536 --> 15:29.667
I should have told you
that I was going

15:29.711 --> 15:31.147
to drag the police
through the mud.

15:31.191 --> 15:34.368
But you know how impulsive I am.

15:34.411 --> 15:35.847
Hmm.

15:35.891 --> 15:38.328
Yeah.

15:39.329 --> 15:40.722
What are you doing?

15:40.765 --> 15:43.986
Doing what I do best.
Being impulsive.

15:44.030 --> 15:45.727
You, uh...?

15:45.770 --> 15:47.337
Uh-huh.
Oh.

15:54.475 --> 15:56.956
NANCY:
What did you need to talk about?

15:56.999 --> 16:01.395
You said that...
maybe Celia Hudson

16:01.438 --> 16:03.614
paid someone off.

16:03.658 --> 16:06.356
So I looked into Tiffany's files

16:06.400 --> 16:09.446
and found bank transfer records.

16:09.490 --> 16:11.448
Turns out the Hudsons did pay
someone a large sum of money

16:11.492 --> 16:14.060
just two days
after Lucy was killed.

16:14.103 --> 16:18.542
But... it wasn't a woman.

16:24.896 --> 16:28.596
It was Carson Drew.

16:41.348 --> 16:43.002
Eastern Shore Shipping.

16:44.525 --> 16:46.701
That's the Hudsons'
shell company.

16:46.744 --> 16:50.052
They made a sizeable
one-time payment to your dad

16:50.096 --> 16:52.489
back in 2000.

16:52.533 --> 16:55.927
$50,000.

16:55.971 --> 17:00.280
Why would they pay him
that kind of money all at once?

17:00.323 --> 17:03.196
I don't know.

17:06.329 --> 17:07.548
Nancy?

17:07.591 --> 17:08.984
Uh, he was the Hudsons' lawyer.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.986
I'm sure he got plenty
of wire transfers from them.

17:11.030 --> 17:15.077
Yeah, from their payroll
account, but this...

17:15.121 --> 17:18.211
two days after Lucy died.

17:23.433 --> 17:25.218
George is meeting me
at the Horseshoe Bay Ledger

17:25.261 --> 17:27.829
with 60 lobster rolls.

17:27.872 --> 17:28.917
That's the price of admission

17:28.960 --> 17:30.397
for looking
at their photo archives.

17:30.440 --> 17:32.312
Did you hear what I just said?
Yeah, I heard you list

17:32.355 --> 17:33.617
some accounting information.

17:33.661 --> 17:36.490
That does not prove anything.
So I have to go.

17:36.533 --> 17:39.623
Then I'm coming, too.

17:39.667 --> 17:41.669
CARSON:
Ace?

17:43.453 --> 17:45.542
ACE:
Mr. D!

17:49.372 --> 17:50.330
Hi.

17:50.373 --> 17:53.072
Hey. You okay?

17:53.115 --> 17:54.595
Yeah, great.

17:54.638 --> 17:55.726
I was just showing her...

17:55.770 --> 17:58.468
It's col... it's cold in there.

18:00.862 --> 18:02.298
You're an adult.

18:02.342 --> 18:04.474
Just be glad I'm not
on the board of health.

18:04.518 --> 18:06.650
Actually, I was going to ask you

18:06.694 --> 18:08.696
where I could
find Laura. Hi.

18:08.739 --> 18:10.132
I'm Carson Drew.

18:10.176 --> 18:13.092
The Hudsons' errand boy.
What do you want?

18:14.876 --> 18:18.358
I'm sure you want to be done
with all of the paperwork

18:18.401 --> 18:21.230
and red tape that has come
with your sister's death.

18:21.274 --> 18:22.231
Murder.

18:22.275 --> 18:23.885
So...

18:23.928 --> 18:28.237
Celia Hudson would love
to discuss settling

18:28.281 --> 18:29.760
outside of court.

18:29.804 --> 18:34.287
This... doesn't need to be
a long and arduous process.

18:34.330 --> 18:37.855
Mmm, but I love
long and arduous.

18:37.899 --> 18:39.727
Especially when it means
that family

18:39.770 --> 18:42.599
doesn't get a dime
of my sister's money.

18:43.948 --> 18:46.429
Ace, miss me.

18:48.997 --> 18:52.609
Mr. D, if Ryan Hudson
doesn't get a dime

18:52.653 --> 18:56.091
of Tiffany's money,
then who does?

18:56.135 --> 19:00.400
If the police officially
conclude Tiffany was murdered,

19:00.443 --> 19:02.663
then it all goes to
the last living member

19:02.706 --> 19:04.665
of the Tandy family.

19:04.708 --> 19:06.493
Your girlfriend.

19:11.062 --> 19:14.544
NANCY:
Here's the Sea Queen archive box.

19:14.588 --> 19:18.635
Candice said there were
more photos of Lucy here.

19:19.636 --> 19:22.378
You don't want
to talk about your dad...

19:22.422 --> 19:24.685
we don't have to.

19:26.991 --> 19:28.993
But I'm hoping that you do.

19:30.604 --> 19:33.520
Do you really think
the deposit was a coincidence?

19:33.563 --> 19:35.652
Could you pass me
those pictures?

19:35.696 --> 19:38.307
There's got to be
something good in there.

19:40.527 --> 19:42.572
You know you can talk to me
about anything, right?

19:42.616 --> 19:45.184
Of course.

19:47.534 --> 19:48.926
Look at this.

19:48.970 --> 19:50.580
Candice never mentioned
that her and Lucy

19:50.624 --> 19:52.016
got into a fight.

19:52.060 --> 19:54.367
She also said that Lucy left

19:54.410 --> 19:55.368
before the ribbon-
cutting ceremony,

19:55.411 --> 19:56.934
so that's a lot of lies.

19:59.328 --> 20:01.678
Aw, shoot.

20:01.722 --> 20:04.594
[clattering]

20:06.422 --> 20:07.989
Somebody there?

20:08.032 --> 20:09.991
[eerie breathing]

20:10.034 --> 20:11.253
[gasping]

20:13.777 --> 20:16.780
We have to get the coins
back in the box.

20:16.824 --> 20:18.826
That's why they're here.

20:23.091 --> 20:25.093
[eerie breathing stops]

20:33.754 --> 20:35.712
[eerie breathing resumes]

20:37.453 --> 20:39.368
Where's the last coin?

20:44.417 --> 20:45.548
Nick!

20:51.075 --> 20:52.555
Let's get out of here.

20:56.907 --> 20:57.908
You like?

20:59.867 --> 21:01.085
It's a face mask.

21:01.129 --> 21:03.044
[whispering]:
I'm keeping Victoria sober.

21:03.087 --> 21:05.351
Yeah, I can still see
the dark, terrifying forces

21:05.394 --> 21:07.309
descending on our town,

21:07.353 --> 21:09.268
but at least my pores
are unclogging.

21:09.311 --> 21:11.922
More importantly, I have been
creating my vision board,

21:11.966 --> 21:14.708
and I Zillowed
the perfect little cottage

21:14.751 --> 21:16.840
for me to move into
when I'm ready.

21:16.884 --> 21:18.842
Six bedrooms? That is very nice.

21:18.886 --> 21:21.497
Mm.
Dibs on the guesthouse.

21:21.541 --> 21:23.673
Quick question.

21:23.717 --> 21:27.851
Would you know if you were
sleeping with a murderer?

21:27.895 --> 21:30.332
Is this a real-life thing?

21:30.376 --> 21:35.337
I think that Laura
may have killed Tiffany.

21:35.381 --> 21:37.644
Maybe.
No. No, no, no.

21:37.687 --> 21:40.690
Your girlfriend
did not kill her sister.

21:40.734 --> 21:42.953
She and Tiffany were close.
No.

21:42.997 --> 21:44.999
They were suing each other
over a lot of money.

21:45.042 --> 21:48.307
But if she murdered Tiffany,
why would she try so hard

21:48.350 --> 21:51.527
to get people to call
Tiffany's death a murder?

21:51.571 --> 21:53.921
Because in order for her
to collect the inheritance,

21:53.964 --> 21:56.097
it has to be declared a murder.

21:56.140 --> 21:57.359
Look.

21:58.926 --> 22:02.756
Laura was tagged in a photo
the morning that Tiffany died.

22:02.799 --> 22:04.627
Geotagged ten miles from here.

22:04.671 --> 22:05.889
That gives her motive

22:05.933 --> 22:08.109
and opportunity.

22:08.152 --> 22:09.589
NANCY:
Hey, did you guys

22:09.632 --> 22:11.199
find anything out
about Candice Weaver

22:11.242 --> 22:13.375
that would explain
why she'd lie to us?

22:13.419 --> 22:15.203
@CandiCanDoltAll?

22:15.246 --> 22:17.814
Yeah, she's all over
Ryan's social media.

22:17.858 --> 22:20.861
I'm talking liking every post
for the last decade.

22:20.904 --> 22:23.907
NANCY:
So, Candice has a thing for
Ryan. I wonder for how long.

22:23.951 --> 22:25.866
Maybe she was jealous
of Lucy and Ryan's relationship?

22:25.909 --> 22:27.389
But enough to kill her rival?

22:27.433 --> 22:29.913
[FaceTime rings]

22:32.307 --> 22:34.004
JOHN:
Nancy, hey.

22:34.048 --> 22:37.268
The good news is I got
the toxicology back on Tiffany.

22:37.312 --> 22:38.879
She didn't die
of natural causes.

22:38.922 --> 22:40.489
She was poisoned.

22:40.533 --> 22:43.274
We're still trying to figure out
the exact source.

22:43.318 --> 22:45.712
It's rare and hard to detect,

22:45.755 --> 22:48.105
so more to come. Uh... that's amazing.

22:48.149 --> 22:49.890
Thank you so much.
You're the best.

22:49.933 --> 22:52.719
Yeah, I hope you still think so
when you hear the bad news.

22:52.762 --> 22:55.461
I can't find the box
with all the Lucy evidence.

22:55.504 --> 22:56.940
A-All of it?

22:56.984 --> 22:59.508
The crown,

22:59.552 --> 23:01.902
the unidentified female hair?

23:01.945 --> 23:05.079
Uh, I'm so sorry, Nancy.
Uh, it's just gone.

23:05.122 --> 23:06.559
I mean,
I-I'll keep looking for it,

23:06.602 --> 23:08.865
but I'm not gonna be able
to get it to you tonight.

23:08.909 --> 23:11.520
BESS:
Great, how are we going
to do the séance now?

23:11.564 --> 23:12.869
[sighs]

23:17.961 --> 23:19.093
Where is Ace again?

23:19.136 --> 23:21.225
BESS:
He was texting his weed guy

23:21.269 --> 23:23.140
and then he just ran off.

23:23.184 --> 23:25.447
He's stressed.
Relationship stuff.

23:25.491 --> 23:27.188
Okay. The sunset's in an hour,

23:27.231 --> 23:29.016
and we have to do the séance
at nightfall.

23:29.059 --> 23:31.061
And without Lucy's crown...

23:31.105 --> 23:33.803
All hands on deck
to find something Lucy touched

23:33.847 --> 23:35.152
the night she died.

23:35.196 --> 23:37.633
Look, Nancy, this happened
almost 20 years ago.

23:37.677 --> 23:39.069
It's not gonna happen.

23:39.113 --> 23:41.637
Then get rid of those coins.
We can't give up.

23:41.681 --> 23:43.552
We've been so focused
on the Hudsons...

23:43.596 --> 23:45.293
Because they look super guilty.

23:45.336 --> 23:47.382
But Candice is
a real suspect, too.

23:47.426 --> 23:49.471
So we just need to talk to Lucy,

23:49.515 --> 23:51.299
and then we can figure out
what actually happened to her

23:51.342 --> 23:53.214
or if we're even
on the right path.

23:53.257 --> 23:55.172
There's got to be
something here.

23:55.216 --> 23:56.260
GEORGE:
If only she applied

23:56.304 --> 23:58.741
this work ethic
to her actual work.

23:59.829 --> 24:01.440
Wait.

24:01.483 --> 24:04.921
Lucy was wearing a bracelet most
of the night but not at the end.

24:04.965 --> 24:07.141
Hey.

24:07.184 --> 24:08.751
I've seen this charm before.

24:08.795 --> 24:10.927
My boss, Josh Dodd,

24:10.971 --> 24:12.015
wears it around his neck.

24:18.326 --> 24:21.329
NANCY:
Lucy Sable was your sister.

24:21.372 --> 24:24.724
Must've been hard,
losing her like that.

24:24.767 --> 24:27.509
Having her murder turned
into a town superstition.

24:27.553 --> 24:31.121
I know I'd be angry
if she were my sister.

24:31.165 --> 24:33.689
Half sister.

24:33.733 --> 24:36.300
[exhales]

24:36.344 --> 24:39.347
But, um, can we keep that
between us?

24:39.390 --> 24:41.392
I moved back to town a year ago,

24:41.436 --> 24:43.220
after I inherited this shop
from my grandpa,

24:43.264 --> 24:46.180
and nobody recognized me and...

24:46.223 --> 24:47.573
it's a lot easier that way.

24:49.096 --> 24:51.185
I got it.
We're not here to out you.

24:51.228 --> 24:53.622
We just have a couple questions.

24:53.666 --> 24:56.538
So, you and your mom

24:56.582 --> 24:58.409
moved away
right after Lucy died?

24:58.453 --> 25:01.412
Yeah, nobody wanted us
in Horseshoe Bay.

25:01.456 --> 25:05.286
We made Lucy's death too real.

25:05.329 --> 25:08.071
Too sad.

25:08.115 --> 25:12.423
And a developer offered my mom
a lot of money for our house.

25:13.512 --> 25:15.557
Out of nowhere?

25:15.601 --> 25:18.821
NANCY:
Lucy gave you that charm
the night she died. Right?

25:18.865 --> 25:21.563
Do you think that she knew
that she was in danger?

25:21.607 --> 25:23.522
She did seem
a little off that night.

25:23.565 --> 25:26.568
Towards, uh, the end
of the festival, she...

25:26.612 --> 25:30.659
she took me aside
and she handed me her bracelet.

25:30.703 --> 25:33.357
And then she hugged me
and said, um,

25:33.401 --> 25:35.664
"Don't believe
what they say about me."

25:38.711 --> 25:41.452
That was the last time
I saw her.

25:43.629 --> 25:45.587
I can only imagine how much
that charm means to you.

25:45.631 --> 25:47.763
[sniffles]

25:49.983 --> 25:55.336
This, uh, belonged to my mom.

25:55.379 --> 25:58.600
I wear it every day, so...

25:58.644 --> 26:02.952
please know that I don't
ask this lightly.

26:02.996 --> 26:05.172
Can we borrow Lucy's
charm? Just for tonight.

26:05.215 --> 26:06.608
We think

26:06.652 --> 26:08.436
that it could help us
figure out who killed her.

26:08.479 --> 26:10.612
[laughs softly]

26:10.656 --> 26:12.483
How?

26:12.527 --> 26:14.529
It's really hard to explain.

26:14.573 --> 26:16.096
NICK:
Hey, you can

26:16.139 --> 26:18.228
trust her.

26:19.186 --> 26:20.274
I do.

26:24.234 --> 26:27.237
So, if you find out
who killed her...

26:27.281 --> 26:29.283
We can get justice for her.

26:33.635 --> 26:36.072
Here you go, Victoria.

26:36.116 --> 26:39.641
I made it extra toasty
this time.

26:39.685 --> 26:41.251
Victoria.

26:41.295 --> 26:43.819
Victoria.

26:43.863 --> 26:45.168
You lost her?

26:45.212 --> 26:47.214
She said she'd wait.
She promised.

26:47.257 --> 26:49.085
You wanted to believe
the best in her.

26:49.129 --> 26:51.218
Rookie mistake.

26:51.261 --> 26:53.263
But...

26:54.743 --> 26:56.789
[sighs]

26:56.832 --> 26:59.661
NANCY:
George was hoping Victoria would try

26:59.705 --> 27:01.576
to get arrested again.

27:01.620 --> 27:03.883
No such luck.

27:03.926 --> 27:06.320
McGINNIS:
Nancy Drew.

27:06.363 --> 27:08.583
Let's catch up.

27:23.598 --> 27:27.080
Well, thanks to Laura Tandy,
state police are moving in

27:27.123 --> 27:28.821
on the Tiffany Hudson
investigation.

27:30.953 --> 27:32.694
I have to send over
all our evidence,

27:32.738 --> 27:36.176
which includes
you breaking in to the morgue

27:36.219 --> 27:38.961
and serving Tiffany
her last meal.

27:39.005 --> 27:41.094
The food came back clean.

27:41.137 --> 27:43.444
Poison can be difficult
to detect.

27:44.750 --> 27:46.969
You know I didn't kill her.

27:47.013 --> 27:50.233
And you know I'm not the bad cop
Laura's making me out to be.

27:51.887 --> 27:54.324
[chuckles]
Okay.

27:57.110 --> 28:00.591
I believe Laura had motive
to kill Tiffany.

28:00.635 --> 28:04.160
So if you have anything,

28:04.204 --> 28:06.902
we both need to solve
this murder.

28:06.946 --> 28:09.078
You need to fix your reputation.

28:09.122 --> 28:11.080
And you need to clear your name.

28:11.124 --> 28:13.735
I have a lot of red tape
that's in the way.

28:13.779 --> 28:16.259
And you have a gift

28:16.303 --> 28:20.873
for getting access to...
all sorts of things.

28:20.916 --> 28:22.265
What are you hinting at?

28:22.309 --> 28:25.268
As much as it pains me
to say it,

28:25.312 --> 28:29.403
it's time for us
to work together.

28:30.491 --> 28:32.449
[door closes]

28:32.493 --> 28:35.235
Hey. I have a new theory
for you.

28:35.278 --> 28:37.324
I have a theory, too.

28:38.499 --> 28:40.675
I think you're working
for McGinnis.

28:40.719 --> 28:42.851
You were the only one that he
didn't bring in for questioning

28:42.895 --> 28:44.853
the night Tiffany died.

28:44.897 --> 28:47.334
And I saw you together
at the funeral.

28:47.377 --> 28:49.379
What were you guys
talking about?

28:50.119 --> 28:51.860
You've been cagey on the phone,

28:51.904 --> 28:54.341
and then running off
to who knows where.

28:54.384 --> 28:56.996
You heard my phone call
with John Sander,

28:57.039 --> 28:58.519
and less than an hour later,

28:58.562 --> 29:01.261
McGinnis is talking
to me about poison.

29:02.697 --> 29:04.699
It's not like that.

29:08.834 --> 29:10.574
A year ago,

29:10.618 --> 29:14.796
McGinnis caught me hacking into
a government computer system,

29:14.840 --> 29:16.363
which is a federal offense.

29:16.406 --> 29:19.409
Why would you...? Hey... the point is,

29:19.453 --> 29:22.369
I thought my life was over,
but he offered me this deal.

29:22.412 --> 29:24.980
He'd make sure that I stay out
of jail, and all I had to do

29:25.024 --> 29:27.069
was look into a few things
for him, keep my eyes open

29:27.113 --> 29:29.028
around town,
which was easy enough,

29:29.071 --> 29:32.074
until Tiffany
got murdered. You could've told us.

29:32.118 --> 29:34.294
That would have violated
the deal.

29:34.337 --> 29:36.339
I can't go to jail.

29:36.383 --> 29:38.254
Listen, I'm sorry.
I'm not trying

29:38.298 --> 29:42.215
to make excuses.
I... I messed up.

29:42.258 --> 29:45.653
But will you at least let me
try to make it up to you here?

29:45.696 --> 29:47.873
I learned something about Laura.

29:47.916 --> 29:51.093
I... how am I supposed to trust
anything you say?

29:56.751 --> 29:58.274
I'm gonna fix this.

30:04.933 --> 30:07.936
GEORGE:
So, my mom got overwhelmed
by the energy of the coins,

30:07.980 --> 30:10.504
and in a not-at-all-surprising
not-twist ending,

30:10.547 --> 30:12.201
she got wasted.

30:12.245 --> 30:13.986
She's in pretty rough shape.

30:14.029 --> 30:15.683
Like the worst
I've ever seen her.

30:15.726 --> 30:16.945
And that's saying a lot.

30:16.989 --> 30:18.860
Well, there's always
the next new moon.

30:18.904 --> 30:20.644
I'm not sitting on the coins
for another month.

30:20.688 --> 30:22.864
We do a séance now. Alone?

30:22.908 --> 30:23.865
Without clairvoyant supervision?

30:23.909 --> 30:25.214
You'd be surprised

30:25.258 --> 30:27.695
at what you could do alone.
I'm in.

30:27.738 --> 30:30.959
Me, too. Nick?

30:31.003 --> 30:34.833
We're all
on the same team, right?

30:34.876 --> 30:36.835
Okay.

30:39.446 --> 30:40.839
BESS:
Fine.

30:40.882 --> 30:43.842
But this has nothing
to do with my ghost FOMO.

30:43.885 --> 30:45.887
I brought something we can use
to talk to Lucy. Ted!

30:45.931 --> 30:47.889
NANCY:
Your sister?

30:47.933 --> 30:51.240
GEORGE:
Not quite. Ted?

30:51.284 --> 30:53.547
Since Lucy communicates

30:53.590 --> 30:54.896
through electronics,
we can have her answer questions

30:54.940 --> 30:56.332
through the dragon.

30:56.376 --> 30:57.856
She can make the eyes
light up green for yes,

30:57.899 --> 30:59.118
the mouth red for no.

31:01.903 --> 31:03.905
You said I'd get something.

31:03.949 --> 31:06.952
One thing. Five things.

31:06.995 --> 31:08.954
Five is good.
[quietly]: Five is good.

31:08.997 --> 31:11.652
Great. Now she's spoiled.

31:11.695 --> 31:14.176
[pop music playing
on headphones]

31:33.239 --> 31:34.370
[screams]

31:34.414 --> 31:36.372
[whispers]:
Bess.

31:36.416 --> 31:38.157
Sorry. Okay?

31:38.200 --> 31:40.899
That was a big buildup.
