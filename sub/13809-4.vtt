SHERRY, YOU READY FOR THIS?

00:55.388 --> 00:56.765
RAYMUNDO CAME THROUGH.

00:56.848 --> 00:58.558
I'M HAVING MY BIRTHDAY PARTY
AT MADTOWN SKATE PARK.

Sherry:
Oh, Reg!

01:00.226 --> 01:04.397
The parties at the Shore Shack
were getting a little tired.

01:04.480 --> 01:06.775
REALLY? BUT I THOUGHT
YOU LIKED THE SHACK.

01:06.858 --> 01:09.486
OH, DON'T GET ME WRONG,
THE SHACK IS TOTALLY COOL.

01:09.569 --> 01:11.696
IT'S JUST THOSE
GOOFY COCONUT PARTY HATS

01:11.780 --> 01:13.656
AND TWISTER BLOWING
MILK OUT HIS NOSE.

01:13.740 --> 01:15.033
IT'S SO JUVENILE.

01:15.116 --> 01:16.743
MADTOWN'S MUCH COOLER, SHER.

01:16.826 --> 01:18.161
AND THIS YEAR,
EVERYBODY'S INVITED.

01:18.244 --> 01:22.707

{\an1}THIS IS THE PERFECT

CHECK IT OUT,
I GOT AN IDEA

01:30.590 --> 01:32.717

02:08.461 --> 02:10.547
NOT A GOOD SITUATION, MAN.

02:10.630 --> 02:12.215
TOO MUCH AIR.

02:12.298 --> 02:13.591
NO, TOO MANY BROKEN RULES.

02:13.675 --> 02:16.386

02:22.016 --> 02:23.184
I HATE TO DO THIS

02:23.268 --> 02:26.354
BUT THE FOUR OF YOU ARE
SUSPENDED FROM THE PARK.

02:26.437 --> 02:29.566
SUSPENDED?! I'VE NEVER BEEN
SUSPENDED FROM ANYTHING.

02:29.649 --> 02:30.650
HOW LONG?

{\an1}A WEEK?!

02:36.114 --> 02:38.324
BUT I'M HAVING
MY PARTY HERE.

02:38.408 --> 02:38.783
NOT ANYMORE.

02:38.867 --> 02:39.909
ISN'T THERE SOME WAY

02:39.993 --> 02:41.744
{\an1}YOU'LL LET US
HAVE THE PARTY?

02:41.828 --> 02:43.913
I'M SORRY, MY FRIENDS

02:43.997 --> 02:48.126
BUT THERE'S NOTHING
CONROY COULD DO.

02:48.209 --> 02:49.627
LOOK, REG,
I'M SORRY.

02:49.711 --> 02:52.213
I HAD NO IDEA.

THIS PARTY IS TO ME?

02:58.136 --> 03:00.847
EVERYBODY'S COMING TO SEE ME
AND I WON'T BE HERE.

YOUR PARTY AT THE SHACK.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.941
IT'LL BE MORE...

03:12.025 --> 03:13.192
TRADITIONAL.

03:13.276 --> 03:14.611
CHEAPER, TOO.

03:14.694 --> 03:16.112
THAT'S NOT THE POINT, DAD.

03:16.195 --> 03:18.740
EVERYBODY'S EXPECTING
TO HAVE A MAD TIME AT MADTOWN.

03:18.823 --> 03:19.866
NOW I HAVE TO TELL THEM

03:19.949 --> 03:22.327
WE'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE
ANOTHER RINKY-DINK SHACK PARTY.

03:22.410 --> 03:26.372
{\an5}RINKY-DINK! YOU KIDS HAVE HAD
YOUR BIRTHDAYS AT THE SHACK

03:26.456 --> 03:27.832
EVER SINCE YOU WERE BORN.

03:27.916 --> 03:31.127
EXACTLY! MAYBE IT'S TIME
TO START A NEW TRADITION.

03:31.210 --> 03:32.503
NO SHACK PARTY?!

03:32.587 --> 03:33.671
BUT YOU SAID EVERYBODY'S COMING.

03:33.755 --> 03:36.966
EVERYBODY BUT ME.

03:37.050 --> 03:38.801
LIKE THE ANCIENTS SAID:

03:38.885 --> 03:42.764
NO COMMON BROTHER EVER KNOWS THE
PAIN OF THE FLOWER AS HE GROWS.

03:42.847 --> 03:44.849
YOU KNOW,
REGGIE'S GROWING UP, TOO.

03:44.933 --> 03:46.643
COS, THAT'S WHAT I MEANT, COS.

03:46.726 --> 03:47.143
OH!

03:58.321 --> 03:59.864
OH... THANKS.

03:59.948 --> 04:01.074
WELL, YOU LOOK LIKE
SOMEONE WHO FORGOT

04:01.157 --> 04:02.909
TO PUT THE CLAMS
IN THEIR CUSTARD.

04:02.992 --> 04:04.953
IT'S NOT CLAMS,
IT'S MY SISTER.

04:05.036 --> 04:07.246

SHE'S NOT GOING TO HAVE
ANY PARTY AT ALL!

04:13.753 --> 04:15.171
NO BIRTHDAY PARTY?!

04:15.254 --> 04:18.882
{\an1}OH, MY GOODNESS,
THAT JUST ISN'T RIGHT.

04:18.966 --> 04:20.635
IT'S DOWNRIGHT WRONG.

04:20.718 --> 04:22.512
I CAN SEE WHY SHE'S BENT.

04:26.057 --> 04:27.558
(<i> knock at door</i> )

04:27.934 --> 04:30.061

09:55.469 --> 09:56.470
I'LL IGNORE THAT.

09:56.554 --> 09:58.014
BUT WE HAVE TO WORK FAST.

09:58.097 --> 10:00.349
TO THE BAT CAVE!

10:00.433 --> 10:01.183
(<i> splattering</i> )

10:01.267 --> 10:03.269
DON'T BLAME THE LAME-O.

10:03.352 --> 10:04.729
LAME-O DOESN'T LIKE THIS.

10:04.812 --> 10:08.190
{\an5}Girl:
THIS PARTY
STINKS ON ICE.

10:17.283 --> 10:18.868

10:26.375 --> 10:28.419
{\an1}Mrs. Stimpleton:
REGGIE?

10:28.502 --> 10:29.462
(<i> knocking</i> )

10:29.545 --> 10:29.879
IT'S ME, VIOLET.

10:29.962 --> 10:33.215
CAN I COME IN?

10:33.299 --> 10:36.385
{\an5}(<i> sniffing</i> ):
UM, I'M FEELING A LITTLE
UNDER THE WEATHER

10:36.469 --> 10:37.386
MRS. STIMPLETON.

10:37.470 --> 10:38.596
CAN WE DO IT LATER?

10:38.679 --> 10:38.888
IT'LL ONLY TAKE

10:38.971 --> 10:41.432
{\an1}A SEC.

10:41.515 --> 10:42.641
WHATEVER.

10:42.725 --> 10:45.102
{\an1}I CAME OVER TO WISH YOU
A HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

10:45.186 --> 10:48.230
AND, OH, I WANTED YOU TO KNOW
THAT YOU COULD COME ON

10:48.314 --> 10:50.733
OVER TO MY HOUSE
FOR A LITTLE BIRTHDAY FUN!

10:50.816 --> 10:51.901
THAT'S REALLY NICE,
MRS. STIMPLETON...

10:51.984 --> 10:52.985
(<i> coughs</i> )

10:53.069 --> 10:55.237
BUT I NEED MY REST.

10:55.321 --> 10:55.946
YOU'RE SURE.

10:56.030 --> 10:58.157
{\an1}BECAUSE EVERYONE THERE
ASSURES ME

10:58.240 --> 11:00.242
IT'S GOING TO BE
A ROCKIN' TIME!

11:00.326 --> 11:03.788

11:15.216 --> 11:17.051

11:17.134 --> 11:19.595
THIS IS MY PARTY?

11:19.678 --> 11:23.140
BUT I THOUGHT MRS. STIMPLETON
WAS DOING IT.

11:23.224 --> 11:24.392
{\an1}YOUR WONDERFULLY
THOUGHTFUL BROTHER

11:24.475 --> 11:26.268
{\an1}HAD A FEW
SUGGESTIONS TO MAKE.

11:26.352 --> 11:28.104
THEY TURNED OUT
PRETTY WELL.

11:28.187 --> 11:30.147
{\an1}Trisha:
HEY, REG--

11:30.231 --> 11:32.274
VERY NON-LAME PARTY.

11:32.358 --> 11:33.818
LOVE THE PERFORMANCE ARTIST
WITH THE RED NOSE.

11:33.901 --> 11:34.944
{\an3}OH! OH!

11:35.027 --> 11:36.904
THANKS, TRISH.

11:36.987 --> 11:38.739
AND THANK YOU,

11:38.823 --> 11:39.907
<i>NO PROBLEMO.</i>

11:39.990 --> 11:42.076
(<i> laughing</i> ):
OKAY!

11:42.159 --> 11:46.205
NOW, IT'S A PARTY.

11:46.288 --> 11:46.705

12:16.277 --> 12:17.695

12:17.778 --> 12:19.280
WITH THE GANG.

12:19.363 --> 12:20.948
(<i> gasps</i> )

12:21.031 --> 12:21.824
{\an1}NO, YOU ARE NOT,
YOUNG MAN.

12:24.493 --> 12:27.455
SAM, THE OCEAN
IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS.

12:27.538 --> 12:30.791
YOU COULD BE THE NEXT
CAPTAIN KEN GALLANT!

12:30.875 --> 12:32.001
MOM, YOU'RE SCARING ME.

12:32.084 --> 12:33.210
GOOD.

12:33.294 --> 12:34.962
IF YOU WANT TO BE NEAR THE WATER

12:35.045 --> 12:36.881
{\an1}YOU HAVE TO LEARN
HOW TO BE SAFE.

12:36.964 --> 12:38.424
{\an1}I'M SIGNING YOU UP
RIGHT NOW

12:38.507 --> 12:41.010
{\an1}FOR THE OCEAN SHORE'S
JUNIOR LIFEGUARD PROGRAM.

12:41.093 --> 12:42.928
MOM, I CAN'T BE A LIFEGUARD.

12:43.012 --> 12:43.345
I'M NOT BUOYANT.

12:43.429 --> 12:44.388
HONEY, CALM DOWN.

12:44.472 --> 12:46.765
{\an1}YOU KNOW
WHAT THEY SAY:

12:46.849 --> 12:47.349
"BE SAFE AROUND WATER?

12:47.433 --> 12:49.810
{\an1}HECK, YES,
YOU OUGHTTA."

12:49.894 --> 12:50.853
WHO SAYS THAT?

12:50.936 --> 12:52.229
THEY DO, AND IF THEY DON'T

12:52.313 --> 12:53.397
THEY SHOULD.

12:56.442 --> 13:00.362
(<i> all eating noisily</i> )

13:00.446 --> 13:01.572
HUH?

13:02.907 --> 13:05.075
DON'T SAY A WORD.

13:05.159 --> 13:07.369
I'VE GOT TWO: "SEA WEENIE."

13:07.453 --> 13:10.289
{\an1}YOU'RE JOINING
JUNIOR LIFEGUARDS?

13:10.372 --> 13:11.624
MY MOM SIGNED ME UP.

13:11.707 --> 13:14.418
SHE THINKS I NEED
A DOSE OF WATER SAFETY.

13:14.502 --> 13:16.378
{\an4}I BET THE FIRST
PERSON THE SQUID
HAS TO SAVE

13:16.462 --> 13:18.005
{\an1}IS HIMSELF,
RIGHT, TWIST?

13:18.088 --> 13:20.716
OH...

13:20.799 --> 13:22.176
OTTO, TWISTER,
FINISH UP.

13:22.259 --> 13:23.344
LET'S GO SURFING.

13:23.427 --> 13:24.678
I CAN'T GO.

13:24.762 --> 13:26.180
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

13:26.263 --> 13:28.224
I'M A JUNIOR SEA WEENIE.

13:28.307 --> 13:29.934
MY MOM SIGNED ME UP, TOO.

13:34.396 --> 13:35.189
LET'S GET OUT
OF HERE, REG.

13:35.272 --> 13:36.398
WE COULD BE NEXT.

13:36.482 --> 13:38.776
(<i> whistle blows</i> )

13:38.859 --> 13:40.152
Man:
ATTENTION!

13:40.236 --> 13:43.239
JUNIOR GUARDS IN TRAINING,
LET ME INTRODUCE MYSELF.

13:43.322 --> 13:44.406
I AM ASSISTANT LIEUTENANT
TICE RYAN.

13:44.490 --> 13:46.909
I AM NOT HERE TO BABY YOU.

13:46.992 --> 13:48.410
I AM HERE TO TEACH YOU.

13:48.494 --> 13:51.830
{\an1}IT TAKES HARD WORK
AND TOTAL FOCUS.

13:51.914 --> 13:52.998
WET WILLIE!

13:53.082 --> 13:53.999
EYES FRONT!

13:54.083 --> 13:55.751
NO WET WILLIES!

13:55.834 --> 13:58.879
FIRST OF ALL, WE NEED TO SEE
WHAT KIND OF SHAPE YOU'RE IN.

13:58.963 --> 14:02.091
CAN YOU DO THAT, WE WILL PERFORM
THE EXERCISE CREATED AND HONED

14:02.174 --> 14:05.886
BY THE ELITE WATER COMBAT UNIT
THE UNITED STATES NAVY SEALS.

14:05.970 --> 14:07.763
PREPARE FOR

{\an3}AND GO!

AND TOUCH...

14:12.977 --> 14:13.602
THIS IS STUPID.

14:13.686 --> 14:16.480

TO TOUCH MY TOES.

THREE AND FOUR

14:18.857 --> 14:21.402
AND ONE AND TWO
AND THREE AND FOUR

14:21.485 --> 14:22.570
AND TOUCH...

14:31.912 --> 14:33.622
{\an1}YOU KNOW WHAT
THE LAMEST THING

14:33.706 --> 14:35.624
{\an1}ABOUT JUNIOR
LIFEGUARD CAMP IS?

14:35.708 --> 14:36.917
I'M STUCK WITH YOU?

14:37.001 --> 14:37.876
CHECK IT OUT!

(<i> panting</i> )

14:41.547 --> 14:44.925
(<i> whistle blowing</i> )

14:45.009 --> 14:47.970
{\an4}WHO NEEDS SOME
BIG OLD GOOFBALL
WITH A WHISTLE

14:48.053 --> 14:49.513
TELLING YOU
WHAT TO DO?

14:49.597 --> 14:49.972
I GUESS SO.

14:53.267 --> 14:55.311
GOOD FIRST DAY, TRAINEES

14:55.394 --> 14:56.645
BUT IF YOU WANT
TO BE A LIFEGUARD

14:56.729 --> 14:59.857
YOU'VE GOT TO LEARN
HOW TO LISTEN.

14:59.940 --> 15:02.526
ONCE I HAD A RECRUIT
WHO DIDN'T LISTEN

15:02.610 --> 15:04.737
AND YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED?

15:05.988 --> 15:09.450
HE WAS NEVER SEEN AGAIN.

15:09.533 --> 15:12.411
{\an1}YEAH, THAT'S 'CAUSE
HE QUIT THIS DUMB CAMP.

15:12.494 --> 15:14.538
QUIET, MAN, I'M
TRYING TO LISTEN.

15:14.622 --> 15:15.831
RELAX, WE CAN TALK.

15:15.914 --> 15:17.666
THIS IS JUST
LIKE SCHOOL.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.877
{\an1}IF YOUR LITTLE CONVERSATION
IS OVER,<i> CHILDREN!</i>

15:19.960 --> 15:21.170
I'D LIKE TO PREPARE YOU

15:21.253 --> 15:23.130

OF YOUR LIVES.

15:23.213 --> 15:24.340
(<i> yelling</i> ):
IS THAT OKAY

15:24.423 --> 15:26.091
WITH YOU TWO?

YES, SIR.

15:26.175 --> 15:27.384
YES, SIR.

15:27.468 --> 15:30.554
{\an1}REVIEW YOUR MANUALS AND
GET A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP.

15:30.638 --> 15:32.139
DISMISSED!

15:33.515 --> 15:36.727
{\an1}AND I EXPECT BETTER THINGS
FROM YOU TWO TOMORROW.

15:38.562 --> 15:41.774
{\an1}TWIST, YOU NEARLY
GOT US IN HUGE TROUBLE.

15:41.857 --> 15:42.691
FORGET HIM.

15:42.775 --> 15:44.860
I'M BAGGING
THIS LAME CAMP.

15:44.943 --> 15:47.529
{\an4}I'M THE ONE
WHO'S SUPPOSED
TO BE ALL WIMPY

15:47.613 --> 15:48.781
{\an1}BUT I'M THE ONE
COMING BACK TOMORROW

15:48.864 --> 15:52.409
SO I GUESS THAT MAKES
YOU THE SQUID, AGAIN.

15:58.624 --> 16:00.417
OUCH, OOH, OW!

16:01.460 --> 16:02.378
FINALLY.

16:02.461 --> 16:03.379
LACE UP AND LET'S ROLL.

16:03.462 --> 16:06.757
NO WAY, I'M WIPED.

16:06.840 --> 16:10.052
LEARNING TO BE A JUNIOR SEA
WEENIE TOO ROUGH FOR YOU?

16:10.135 --> 16:12.221
HEY, WE HAD TO RUN AND JUMP

16:12.304 --> 16:16.642
AND SWIM AND LEARN HOW
TO SAVE PEOPLE, OKAY?

16:16.725 --> 16:19.436
{\an1}TWISTER, YOU GIVE
SEA WEENIES A BAD NAME.

16:19.520 --> 16:22.022
SEA WEENIES <i> IS</i>
A BAD NAME, SAMMY.

16:22.106 --> 16:24.525
BUT I ACTUALLY LEARNED
A LOT OF GOOD STUFF

16:24.608 --> 16:26.360
AND I'M LOOKING
FORWARD TO TOMORROW.

16:26.443 --> 16:26.860
{\an1}SQUID

16:26.944 --> 16:29.655
LIFEGUARDS ARE LAME.

16:29.738 --> 16:32.366
YEAH, WELL, I THINK
I LIKE BEING LAME.

16:32.449 --> 16:33.117
YOU GO, SAMMY.

16:35.327 --> 16:39.081

(<i> skates rolling</i> )

16:40.708 --> 16:44.586

16:47.673 --> 16:50.134
AND THESE ARE OUR
VOLUNTEER VICTIMS.

16:52.344 --> 16:53.178
{\an1}WHY ARE WE DOING
THIS AGAIN?

16:53.262 --> 16:55.806
{\an5}(<i> mumbling</i> ):
WHEN WE'RE DONE
WITH THIS

16:55.889 --> 16:57.641
WE'RE GOING TO GET
THE 20 BUCKS.

16:59.226 --> 17:00.102
OH, YEAH.

17:00.185 --> 17:02.771
{\an1}IS IT AGAINST
THE LIFEGUARD RULES

17:02.855 --> 17:05.691
TO REFUSE TO SAVE
AN OLDER BROTHER?

17:05.773 --> 17:07.483

{\an1}I'VE NEVER SEEN SAMMY
SWIM SO FAST.

17:30.090 --> 17:33.427
HE'S PROBABLY BEING
CHASED BY A MINNOW.

17:35.804 --> 17:36.054
HELP, HELP.

17:38.057 --> 17:40.559
GLUB, GLUB.

17:41.143 --> 17:42.478
{\an1}YOU SAVE MY
BROTHER, SAM.

17:42.561 --> 17:44.897
I'M NOT MOTIVATED.

17:46.023 --> 17:48.067
REMAIN CALM,
SIR OR MADAM.

17:48.150 --> 17:49.526
I AM A TRAINED LIFEGUARD.

17:49.610 --> 17:52.696
{\an1}PLEASE TAKE THE RESCUE CAN,
AND I WILL TOW YOU TO SAFETY.

17:52.780 --> 17:56.366

GIVE ME THAT!

18:06.168 --> 18:07.169

18:07.252 --> 18:09.588
LOOK, SAM'S GOT
LARS UNDER CONTROL.

18:09.671 --> 18:10.547
HE'S BRINGING HIM BACK.

18:10.631 --> 18:13.509
(<i> Sam panting</i> )

18:13.592 --> 18:14.968
EXCELLENT WORK, DULLARD.

18:15.052 --> 18:17.179

18:17.262 --> 18:18.639
WHERE IS
YOUR VICTIM?

18:18.722 --> 18:20.849
UH... I COULDN'T
CALM HIM VERBALLY?

18:20.933 --> 18:21.850
WHY NOT?

18:21.934 --> 18:24.186
I COULDN'T TELL
WHAT HE WAS SAYING.

18:25.229 --> 18:26.188
(<i> spitting</i> )

18:26.271 --> 18:27.648
(<i> mumbling</i> )

18:27.731 --> 18:29.525
WHERE'S MY 20?

18:29.608 --> 18:32.778
LOOKS LIKE SAMMY'S GETTING THE
HANG OF THIS LIFEGUARD THING.

18:32.861 --> 18:35.155
THE WEEK ISN'T OVER YET.

18:35.239 --> 18:36.949
HE'LL SQUID OUT.

18:39.993 --> 18:42.955
{\an4}IF YOU'RE JUMPING
OFF THE PIER
TO SAVE SOMEONE

18:43.038 --> 18:45.249
YOU'D USE THE CONTACT JUMP.

18:45.332 --> 18:47.251
BECAUSE...

18:47.334 --> 18:49.878
IT'S MORE THAN
THREE FEET HIGH, RIGHT?

18:49.962 --> 18:52.548
OTHERWISE, YOU'D USE
THE STRIKE JUMP?

18:52.631 --> 18:53.549
{\an1}EXACTLY.

18:53.632 --> 18:55.092
HOW WAS LUNCH, GUYS?

18:55.175 --> 18:56.552

<i>RAYMUNDO.</i>

18:56.635 --> 18:58.011
{\an1}GREAT, SIR,
THANKS

18:58.095 --> 18:59.596
BUT WE GOT TO SPLIT.

19:05.144 --> 19:07.729
LOOK AT THE CHANGE
IN LITTLE BROTHER SAM.

19:07.813 --> 19:10.774
HE REMINDS ME OF A SLOW-BLOOMING
BIRD OF PARADISE

19:10.858 --> 19:13.986
AND TWISTER JUST MIGHT HAVE
A BRAIN AFTER ALL, HUH?

19:14.069 --> 19:15.737
DON'T STRETCH IT, BRO.

19:15.821 --> 19:17.656
I SURE AM PROUD
OF THOSE GUYS, THOUGH.

19:17.739 --> 19:19.950
WHAT'S WITH YOU TWO?

19:20.033 --> 19:21.243
I'M BORED.

19:21.326 --> 19:24.538
{\an1}WITH TWISTER AND SAM GONE,
THERE'S NO ONE TO HANG WITH.

19:24.621 --> 19:26.915
THERE'S JUST... OTTO.

19:26.999 --> 19:28.125
I DON'T MISS 'EM.

19:28.208 --> 19:30.168
ROCKETS DON'T
LIKE LIFEGUARD

19:30.252 --> 19:31.336
OR THEIR RULES.

19:31.420 --> 19:32.296
RIGHT, DAD?

19:32.379 --> 19:34.381
WRONG, OTTO,
VERY WRONG.

19:34.464 --> 19:34.882
HUH?

19:34.965 --> 19:37.175
LISTEN TO ME, YOU TWO.

19:37.259 --> 19:39.011
MANY YEARS AGO, IN HAWAII

19:39.094 --> 19:42.055
WISE PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTOOD
AND RESPECTED

19:42.139 --> 19:44.558
THE INCREDIBLE POWER
OF THE OCEAN

19:44.641 --> 19:47.436
WALKED ITS SHORES AND TOLD TALES
OF ITS AMAZING POWER.

19:47.519 --> 19:51.481
THAT WAY, SWIMMERS, SAILORS AND
EVEN FAST-FOOD ENTREPRENEURS

19:51.565 --> 19:53.942
WOULD ALSO COME
TO RESPECT ITS POWER.

19:54.026 --> 19:58.238
NOWADAYS WE CALL THOSE
WISE PEOPLE LIFEGUARDS.

19:58.322 --> 19:59.740
THAT'S A COOL STORY, TITO.

19:59.823 --> 20:01.867
DAD, CAN I JOIN
THE JUNIOR LIFEGUARDS?

20:01.950 --> 20:02.784
{\an3}WHAT?

20:02.868 --> 20:04.286
YOU WANT TO, HONEY?

20:04.369 --> 20:05.287
SURE.

20:05.370 --> 20:06.914
IT COULD BE
KIND OF COOL.

20:06.997 --> 20:09.666
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

20:13.211 --> 20:17.299
WELL, RECRUITS, YOU MADE IT
TO THE LAST SESSION OF TRAINING.

20:17.382 --> 20:18.926

20:40.072 --> 20:41.323
WHAT YOU DOING, TITO?

20:41.406 --> 20:43.325
I'M JUST FILLING
THIS LOBSTER POT

20:43.408 --> 20:44.910
WITH SEA WATER,
LITTLE COS.

20:44.993 --> 20:46.495
OLD ISLAND RECIPE.

20:46.578 --> 20:50.249
HEY, LOOKS LIKE LIFEGUARD CAMP
IS WINDING DOWN.

20:50.332 --> 20:53.627
EVERYONE I KNOW HAS TURNED
INTO LIFEGUARDS.

20:53.710 --> 20:56.171
IT'S LIKE A PLAGUE
OF RED-SHORTED BONEHEADS.

20:56.254 --> 21:00.717
{\an5}OH, THIS LOBSTER POT'S
GETTING PRETTY HEAVY.

21:00.801 --> 21:01.760

21:01.843 --> 21:03.011
OH, OH...

21:03.095 --> 21:03.720

21:25.701 --> 21:27.160
HANG ON, TITO.

21:27.244 --> 21:28.537
OH, MAN, HELP!

21:28.620 --> 21:31.164
DAD, HELP!

WE ARE TRAINED
TO HELP YOU.

21:35.252 --> 21:39.047

LIFEGUARD-IN-TRAINING BROTHER.

21:39.131 --> 21:40.215

21:41.967 --> 21:46.054
GRAB ON WITH
BOTH HANDS, TITO.

IF YOU CAN,
HELP ME AND SAM

22:04.031 --> 22:06.366
CONGRATULATIONS,
DULLARD AND RODRIGUEZ.

YOU PASSED YOUR LAST TEST.

22:08.160 --> 22:09.077
TEST!

22:09.161 --> 22:10.746
WE SAVED TITO'S LIFE.

22:10.829 --> 22:13.373

REALLY BEEN DROWNING.

22:14.708 --> 22:16.918
I DON'T GET IT.

22:17.002 --> 22:19.421
IT'S THE OLD
"HAWAIIAN IN DISTRESS" TEST.

22:19.504 --> 22:22.841
TITO'S AN OLD NORTH SHORE
LIFEGUARD FROM WAY BACK.

22:22.924 --> 22:25.886
{\an4}WE ALWAYS SURPRISE
OUR JUNIOR LIFEGUARDS

22:25.969 --> 22:30.348
AND YOU TWO CAME THROUGH
WITH FLYING COLORS.

22:30.432 --> 22:32.017
YOU WERE A LIFEGUARD?

22:33.018 --> 22:37.481
SORRY ABOUT THE LAME
LIFEGUARD CRACK BEFORE, TITO.

22:37.564 --> 22:39.066
NO PROB, LITTLE COS.

22:39.149 --> 22:40.525
WAY TO GO, YOU GUYS.
