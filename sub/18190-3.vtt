WEBVTT

00:04.000 --> 00:06.030
What is it you wish to know?

00:06.080 --> 00:08.430
I've seen something
I can't make sense of.

00:08.480 --> 00:10.760
Why would Pasiphae spare
Jason's life?

00:12.240 --> 00:14.040
Jason? No! No!

00:15.920 --> 00:17.390
Who is she to him?

00:17.440 --> 00:18.480
She is his mother.

00:26.800 --> 00:31.030
Ehmo klu thi. Po-sey dah-on.
Guy eh okhe -

00:31.080 --> 00:34.750
seh mati too taw thu omeh.

00:34.800 --> 00:40.590
Noo tow-roo kup ton t-os a mu
neh-o hai r-mawn.

01:01.200 --> 01:08.150
Loyal and noble citizens
of Atlantis, today I present to you

01:08.200 --> 01:14.390
Poseidon's Daughter, Goddess
on Earth - Queen Ariadne!

01:33.680 --> 01:36.270
She has not yet been found?
You assured me.

01:36.320 --> 01:39.510
We have many men looking for her,
it can only be a matter of time.

01:39.560 --> 01:43.190
As long as Pasiphae lives,
every enemy of Atlantis has hope.

01:43.240 --> 01:44.510
Is there no good news?

01:44.560 --> 01:46.390
I will not lie to you.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.310
We seek alliances where we can...

01:48.360 --> 01:50.640
But... no-one wishes to ally
with the weak.

01:52.160 --> 01:57.470
Majesty, the Coronation Games
are just a few days away.

01:57.520 --> 01:59.790
Is this really the time
for such diversions?

01:59.840 --> 02:01.470
I'm afraid it is.

02:01.520 --> 02:04.190
You need to choose
a champion to represent Atlantis,

02:04.240 --> 02:05.670
as is our custom.

02:05.720 --> 02:08.639
Not to do so would make the people
think even their Queen despairs.

02:10.800 --> 02:14.110
Very well - see who you can
find from the Royal Guard.

02:14.160 --> 02:17.830
There is one natural choice. Jason.

02:17.880 --> 02:20.550
~ No. ~ He is the finest
swordsman in Atlantis -

02:20.600 --> 02:23.200
~ there can be no doubt of that.
~ It would be inappropriate.

02:24.280 --> 02:29.190
Majesty,
your people have suffered much.

02:29.240 --> 02:33.520
They need a victory -
and Jason can give them that.

02:34.600 --> 02:35.990
You can't accept.

02:36.040 --> 02:39.470
How can I refuse? The request
came from the Queen herself.

02:39.520 --> 02:41.190
It doesn't make
any difference, Jason.

02:41.240 --> 02:44.710
You can never be together.
I thought you understood that?

02:44.760 --> 02:46.710
You've already
risked your life for her and...

02:46.760 --> 02:49.750
Yes, well,
I'm not doing it for Ariadne.

02:49.800 --> 02:51.190
I'm doing it for the city.

02:51.240 --> 02:53.270
These are not ordinary games, Jason.

02:53.320 --> 02:55.950
They'll attract the finest
warriors in all of Greece.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.310
They'll do anything to win.

02:57.360 --> 03:00.230
Well, then, it will be an honour
to compete in such company.

03:00.280 --> 03:03.120
People die in these games!
They actually die!

03:05.480 --> 03:07.400
How can he be so stupid?

03:09.480 --> 03:11.390
~ Was that really necessary? ~ Yes.

03:11.440 --> 03:12.840
What's wrong with you?!

03:13.840 --> 03:15.710
Nothing.

03:15.760 --> 03:18.190
What is it?
What aren't you telling me?

03:18.240 --> 03:21.360
I can't say
cos I promised to tell no-one.

03:22.800 --> 03:27.120
Since when have you kept a promise?
Is it about Jason?

03:30.280 --> 03:33.240
Well, then, I think I should know,
don't you?

03:39.200 --> 03:41.320
I went to see The Oracle.

03:42.560 --> 03:49.400
She told me - she told me
Pasiphae is Jason's mother.

03:53.280 --> 03:54.590
Hercules, if you're...

03:54.640 --> 03:55.680
I'm not.

03:59.200 --> 04:00.590
Well, then we must tell him.

04:00.640 --> 04:01.790
No, no, no.

04:01.840 --> 04:05.350
This changes everything!
He has royal blood.

04:05.400 --> 04:06.390
If Ariadne knew...

04:06.440 --> 04:09.510
Should Jason learn the truth,
his heart will blacken

04:09.560 --> 04:11.590
and he will be lost to us for ever.

04:11.640 --> 04:13.150
The Oracle said that?

04:13.200 --> 04:15.190
The Gods have chosen us
to protect him,

04:15.240 --> 04:17.430
Pythagoras, that's what she said.

04:17.480 --> 04:18.800
Us?

04:20.279 --> 04:22.430
Left, right, feign and strike!

04:22.480 --> 04:28.270
Good. Left, right, feign, strike!
Faster! Left, right, feign, strike.

04:28.320 --> 04:29.790
Good.

04:29.840 --> 04:31.360
Stop, stop - stop!

04:32.440 --> 04:36.550
We can't be out there with him -
our only hope is to keep training.

04:36.600 --> 04:38.790
Come on,
let's practice with the machaira.

04:38.840 --> 04:40.390
Did you just hear something?

04:40.440 --> 04:41.990
The secret to using...

04:42.040 --> 04:44.070
Sh!

04:44.120 --> 04:45.160
There!

05:18.200 --> 05:19.390
How can I thank you?

05:19.440 --> 05:21.150
Your survival is thanks enough.

05:21.200 --> 05:23.640
Though a small token
wouldn't go amiss.

05:24.680 --> 05:26.150
I'm Jason.

05:26.200 --> 05:29.350
That's Hercules, and Pythagoras.

05:29.400 --> 05:32.630
~ Telemon. ~ Where are you headed?
~ I was on my way to Atlantis

05:32.680 --> 05:34.430
to compete in the Coronation Games.

05:34.480 --> 05:37.430
Ah, then you'll come up
against our very finest.

05:37.480 --> 05:40.200
~ No doubt.
~ No, I meant our VERY finest.

05:41.280 --> 05:42.790
Is this true?

05:42.840 --> 05:44.350
We were just out here practising.

05:44.400 --> 05:47.160
We should get back.
Who knows if they were alone?

05:49.880 --> 05:53.390
You were unlucky, my friend.
In broad daylight, too.

05:53.440 --> 05:55.670
Perhaps I was foolish
to travel alone.

05:55.720 --> 05:59.310
Those woods have been
free from robbers for years.

05:59.360 --> 06:00.880
But since the king died...

06:06.720 --> 06:08.110
This is very kind.

06:08.160 --> 06:09.550
Simple but adequate.

06:09.600 --> 06:11.630
This is luxury after
the last few nights -

06:11.680 --> 06:13.150
I've been sleeping in the forest.

06:13.200 --> 06:14.790
How can I thank you?

06:14.840 --> 06:16.190
Really, no need.

06:16.240 --> 06:17.510
All the same,

06:17.560 --> 06:20.880
this is Lemnian wine.

06:22.880 --> 06:24.990
I was saving it
for a special occasion.

06:25.040 --> 06:26.120
All yours.

06:36.280 --> 06:37.350
I don't trust him.

06:37.400 --> 06:39.510
Make sure the bevel is deep.

06:39.560 --> 06:42.360
~ There's too much that
doesn't make sense. ~ That's good.

06:44.160 --> 06:46.390
I've been thinking
about his clothes.

06:46.440 --> 06:48.670
Since when have you been
interested in clothes?

06:48.720 --> 06:52.310
Did it look like he'd slept in them?
For several days?

06:52.360 --> 06:54.150
And where's his bedding,
his supplies?

06:54.200 --> 06:58.510
A soldier doesn't need supplies -
he makes his bed where he can.

06:58.560 --> 07:01.430
Telemon's fine,
Pythagoras, trust me.

07:01.480 --> 07:04.030
It's Jason we need to worry about.

07:04.080 --> 07:06.720
It's our duty to keep him safe,
remember?

07:14.680 --> 07:19.230
Poseidon's Daughter,
I present Choreon of Ithaca.

07:28.920 --> 07:32.910
Poseidon's Daughter,
I present Leonidas of Corinth.

07:41.280 --> 07:45.790
Poseidon's Daughter, I present
Areto of Scythia.

07:54.560 --> 07:59.870
Poseidon's Daughter,
I present Jason of Atlantis.

08:01.600 --> 08:04.670
Jason! Jason! Jason!

08:04.720 --> 08:06.120
Will you sit down!

08:12.560 --> 08:13.600
Come on, Jason!

08:17.400 --> 08:22.550
Poseidon's Daughter, I present
Prince Telemon of Aegina.

08:29.240 --> 08:30.560
Prince?!

08:38.000 --> 08:39.150
Why didn't he say?

08:39.200 --> 08:42.830
If I'd known he was royalty
I would have charged for the night.

08:42.880 --> 08:44.910
Not a word, not a thing.

08:44.960 --> 08:46.390
I'm sure he had his reasons.

08:46.440 --> 08:49.350
If he really is a prince,
why was he travelling alone?

08:49.400 --> 08:51.870
He could easily have been
murdered by those robbers.

08:51.920 --> 08:53.110
But he wasn't, was he?

08:53.160 --> 08:54.550
Only thanks to us.

08:54.600 --> 08:58.030
I expect he'll want to repay us
in a suitably royal manner -

08:58.080 --> 09:01.830
perhaps a small island,
with its own tavern.

09:01.880 --> 09:03.030
He'll know people.

09:03.080 --> 09:06.560
A prince on his own, without
an entourage - it makes no sense.

09:07.640 --> 09:08.840
Majesty?

09:11.360 --> 09:15.400
May I present his Royal Highness,
Prince Telemon of Aegina?

09:17.080 --> 09:18.240
I'm honoured.

09:19.640 --> 09:21.080
Thank you, Dion.

09:27.880 --> 09:30.990
I am sorry I could not
welcome you to the city myself.

09:31.040 --> 09:33.910
I'm sorry I did not make myself
known to you earlier.

09:33.960 --> 09:35.910
You will of course
stay in the palace?

09:35.960 --> 09:37.350
I would be honoured.

09:37.400 --> 09:39.120
Your retinue is welcome, too.

09:41.720 --> 09:43.470
I have no retinue.

09:43.520 --> 09:45.390
So I understand.

09:45.440 --> 09:48.510
And you'd like to know why
a prince of Aegina travels alone?

09:48.560 --> 09:51.080
Only if he felt
he wished to share it with me.

09:52.320 --> 09:55.590
My father would never approve
of me entering this contest.

09:55.640 --> 09:58.920
And what a father does not know
he cannot censure?

10:00.560 --> 10:02.320
You are very wise for one so young.

10:04.480 --> 10:08.390
Have you never found the burdens
of royalty weigh heavy upon you?

10:08.440 --> 10:09.790
Perhaps.

10:09.840 --> 10:12.110
I wanted to cast them
off for a while.

10:12.160 --> 10:14.510
By winning a contest
in a far-off land?

10:14.560 --> 10:17.040
Perhaps that was not all
I was hoping to win.

10:18.680 --> 10:20.750
I see.

10:20.800 --> 10:24.550
My father thinks our two cities
would make perfect allies,

10:24.600 --> 10:27.960
and what better way to secure
their future than through marriage?

10:29.240 --> 10:30.480
And you?

10:31.600 --> 10:34.800
Cities don't make alliances,
people do.

10:36.880 --> 10:38.320
Which is why I came alone.

10:42.600 --> 10:44.440
Am I too ambitious?

10:50.120 --> 10:52.800
I'm not sure a prince can ever
be too ambitious.

11:09.320 --> 11:10.720
Come on, Jason.

11:20.720 --> 11:21.760
Yes!

11:33.680 --> 11:34.720
Yes, go on!

11:49.240 --> 11:50.480
Yes, he's there!

12:15.000 --> 12:16.520
Don't I know you?

12:18.880 --> 12:20.510
I don't think so.

12:20.560 --> 12:22.510
The salt mines at Hydra.

12:22.560 --> 12:24.360
I'm sorry?

12:25.440 --> 12:26.840
We were in prison there.

12:31.160 --> 12:32.600
You must be mistaken.

13:55.640 --> 13:57.160
Can I help you?

13:59.720 --> 14:01.720
I just wanted to congratulate you.

14:04.160 --> 14:05.680
Here, hold this.

14:11.200 --> 14:13.440
~ May I ask you a question? ~ Tighter.

14:16.240 --> 14:18.160
Do you know Prince Telemon?

14:20.280 --> 14:21.480
Apparently not.

14:24.360 --> 14:25.640
You can let go now.

14:28.920 --> 14:30.520
What do you mean, apparently?

14:34.240 --> 14:35.560
See this?

14:37.280 --> 14:39.760
I spent two years
in the salt mines at Hydra.

14:41.280 --> 14:43.640
You don't forget who you share
that place with.

14:45.520 --> 14:47.120
If he was there, why hide it?

14:48.680 --> 14:50.430
He says I was mistaken.

14:50.480 --> 14:51.880
But I know that face.

14:53.640 --> 14:58.320
Prince or no prince... he was there.

16:12.800 --> 16:16.080
However well we fight, it is
the Gods who decide our fate.

16:21.400 --> 16:22.870
I owe you an apology.

16:22.920 --> 16:25.630
I should have told you who I was.
I had my reasons.

16:25.680 --> 16:26.720
Of course.

16:27.880 --> 16:30.440
I'm not here just to take
part in the contest.

16:32.640 --> 16:34.720
I'm here to win
the heart of Ariadne.

16:36.280 --> 16:38.400
I know - it's not our custom.

16:40.000 --> 16:43.160
If my father had his way,
I'd be here with 100 attendants.

16:44.280 --> 16:47.000
But I wanted Ariadne to see me,
not them.

16:48.560 --> 16:51.110
And does the Queen
know of your intentions?

16:51.160 --> 16:52.550
She does.

16:52.600 --> 16:53.830
And?

16:53.880 --> 16:55.520
And I think there may be hope.

16:58.200 --> 16:59.350
I see.

16:59.400 --> 17:02.110
If I succeed,
I won't forget who to thank.

17:02.160 --> 17:03.920
Without you, I'd be dead in a ditch.

17:19.520 --> 17:21.920
He hasn't eaten a thing.

17:24.040 --> 17:26.640
We can't let him go out
and fight like this.

17:28.119 --> 17:29.950
Maybe I should speak to him?

17:30.000 --> 17:31.280
And say what?

17:32.320 --> 17:34.070
I can't just sit back.

17:34.120 --> 17:39.680
Let him feel it, Hercules.
Remember how you were with Medusa?

17:43.440 --> 17:47.790
I spoke to Areto at
the amphitheatre. She knows Telemon.

17:47.840 --> 17:49.390
They've fought before?

17:49.440 --> 17:52.110
She recognised him
from the prison on Hydra.

17:52.160 --> 17:53.870
That's ridiculous.

17:53.920 --> 17:55.990
What would a prince be doing
in a place like that?

17:56.040 --> 17:57.200
Exactly.

17:58.680 --> 18:01.670
She could be lying. How can we be
sure she's even been there herself?

18:01.720 --> 18:04.510
She showed me her brand -
here, on her wrist.

18:04.560 --> 18:05.950
On her right wrist?

18:06.000 --> 18:08.150
Yes, I think so.
What difference does it make?

18:08.200 --> 18:09.590
I was just wondering about this.

18:09.640 --> 18:11.560
Have you noticed Telemon
wears a brace?

18:13.280 --> 18:15.390
~ A brace? ~ An archer's brace.

18:15.440 --> 18:16.800
He's not an archer.

18:18.440 --> 18:20.360
And he wears it on the wrong wrist.

18:26.320 --> 18:29.280
I just can't imagine
I am the first to seek your hand.

18:32.440 --> 18:35.480
Your beauty alone must have
attracted many suitors.

18:36.560 --> 18:38.270
Not so many.

18:38.320 --> 18:39.600
Am I the only one?

18:41.240 --> 18:43.870
I'm sorry, that was...

18:43.920 --> 18:47.230
Yes - it was.

18:47.280 --> 18:51.150
I could tell you what a wise match
it would be - how Aegina will

18:51.200 --> 18:57.190
guarantee your borders, vanquish
your enemies, fill your treasury.

18:57.240 --> 18:59.230
What Queen could refuse?

18:59.280 --> 19:01.040
One with a heart.

19:04.680 --> 19:07.790
All this I can and will do.

19:07.840 --> 19:12.280
But there is something far more
important to me - your happiness.

19:14.920 --> 19:18.320
I wish to do everything in my power
to make you happy.

19:21.320 --> 19:23.640
If you will give me the chance.

19:32.400 --> 19:35.110
You wished to see me, Majesty?

19:35.160 --> 19:37.630
Yes, I have need of your counsel.

19:37.680 --> 19:39.680
I am always at your service.

19:41.040 --> 19:46.000
Prince Telemon. He has
asked for my hand in marriage.

19:50.720 --> 19:52.790
This is not something unexpected.

19:52.840 --> 19:54.910
The King of Aegina is a wise man.

19:54.960 --> 19:58.110
Naturally he would seek to make
an alliance with Atlantis

19:58.160 --> 19:59.550
through his son.

19:59.600 --> 20:00.870
Indeed.

20:00.920 --> 20:03.150
But perhaps you have other concerns?

20:03.200 --> 20:05.760
Would a Queen in love
need my counsel?

20:08.120 --> 20:09.520
You're a wise man, Dion.

20:12.600 --> 20:16.390
And you are, of course, right -
Atlantis needs allies,

20:16.440 --> 20:18.030
and who better than Aegina?

20:18.080 --> 20:19.160
Indeed.

20:21.360 --> 20:22.440
And yet...

20:24.160 --> 20:25.240
I understand.

20:26.840 --> 20:28.840
But you are Queen of Atlantis.

20:30.880 --> 20:33.840
The future of the city
rests in your hands.

20:36.440 --> 20:37.720
You must accept.

20:54.280 --> 20:55.560
What is it?

21:04.400 --> 21:05.680
Areto?

21:06.760 --> 21:09.390
She's with the Gods now.

21:09.440 --> 21:10.990
What happened?

21:11.040 --> 21:12.920
The contest can be a hard master.

21:14.560 --> 21:16.800
She wasn't seriously hurt. I saw.

21:19.240 --> 21:22.040
Sometimes the strain
on the heart can be too much.

21:24.800 --> 21:27.120
The amphitheatre is
no place for a woman.

21:39.360 --> 21:41.200
Have her taken to the temple.

21:47.200 --> 21:51.350
It was him. Telemon killed her.

21:51.400 --> 21:53.630
That's ridiculous.
Why would he do that?

21:53.680 --> 21:55.910
Because she recognised him.

21:55.960 --> 21:58.430
How could he have killed her?
There wasn't a mark on her.

21:58.480 --> 21:59.910
He might have used a blade.

21:59.960 --> 22:01.190
Then there would be blood!

22:01.240 --> 22:03.590
Not if it was thin enough.
I've heard it can be done.

22:03.640 --> 22:07.390
You go around accusing a prince
of murder, we'll all end up in jail.

22:07.440 --> 22:09.040
He may not even be a prince.

22:10.120 --> 22:12.320
But he is a murderer,
I know that much.

22:19.160 --> 22:21.720
Is she not the most beautiful woman
you have ever seen?

22:24.480 --> 22:26.310
We dined together last night.

22:26.360 --> 22:27.590
Yes?

22:27.640 --> 22:29.720
I do believe
she has feelings for me.

22:30.880 --> 22:33.160
And has she accepted your proposal?

22:35.680 --> 22:39.710
Not in so many words, but I think
it is only a matter of time.

22:39.760 --> 22:41.670
I see.

22:41.720 --> 22:43.670
Did you think she might not?

22:43.720 --> 22:46.510
I, um... I don't know.

22:46.560 --> 22:49.350
Ariadne understands her position.
She knows how valuable

22:49.400 --> 22:51.840
an alliance between
our two great cities would be.

23:07.760 --> 23:09.800
May Poseidon keep him safe.

23:11.720 --> 23:12.760
Come on, Jason!

23:27.360 --> 23:28.400
Yes!

23:51.040 --> 23:52.240
Oh, yes!

24:50.560 --> 24:52.310
Did you see that?

24:52.360 --> 24:54.910
If he isn't who he says
he is, then who is he?

24:54.960 --> 24:56.520
And what does he want?

25:31.320 --> 25:32.870
You fought well.

25:32.920 --> 25:34.240
The Gods were kind.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.870
Would you like some help with that?

25:39.920 --> 25:41.310
I'm fine - thank you.

25:41.360 --> 25:43.710
I thought perhaps you might like to
remove your brace.

25:43.760 --> 25:44.990
I wear it for fortune's sake.

25:45.040 --> 25:47.640
And not to cover up
a brand from the salt mines?

25:50.360 --> 25:51.600
No?

26:05.960 --> 26:07.160
Yes.

26:12.240 --> 26:15.230
I have indeed spent time
in Hydra prison.

26:15.280 --> 26:17.350
Why? What was your crime?

26:17.400 --> 26:20.350
Being young - and foolish.

26:20.400 --> 26:23.670
At 18, I ran away from Aegina.

26:23.720 --> 26:26.270
I thought I could make
my own way in the world.

26:26.320 --> 26:28.870
Prove to my father
I didn't need his help.

26:28.920 --> 26:32.110
I fell in with some people
I thought were adventurers,

26:32.160 --> 26:33.790
turned out they were more pirates.

26:33.840 --> 26:35.270
They wouldn't brand a prince.

26:35.320 --> 26:39.310
That was my father.
He insisted on no special treatment.

26:39.360 --> 26:43.030
And much as I hated him for it
at the time, I've had reason

26:43.080 --> 26:44.320
to be grateful since.

26:45.680 --> 26:47.310
This was the making of me.

26:47.360 --> 26:49.480
We only have your word
for any of this.

26:50.800 --> 26:52.240
Not so.

26:56.520 --> 26:59.790
I fought in the amphitheatre
at Aegina a year ago -

26:59.840 --> 27:02.160
Prince Telemon
was at his father's side.

27:08.520 --> 27:09.840
No hard feelings.

27:12.720 --> 27:16.320
I know you act only out of love
for your city and your Queen.

27:18.960 --> 27:21.920
Absolutely. Easy mistake.

27:23.760 --> 27:28.320
(Bow, smile, walk away... walk away)

27:37.560 --> 27:38.990
It could make sense.

27:39.040 --> 27:40.520
But why hide it?

27:41.920 --> 27:45.430
A prison brand is not the kind
of thing you want everyone to see.

27:45.480 --> 27:46.990
It doesn't add up.

27:47.040 --> 27:50.400
It's not a triangle, Pythagoras -
it doesn't have to add up.

27:55.440 --> 27:56.760
Do you trust him?

27:59.960 --> 28:01.870
No. No, I don't.

28:01.920 --> 28:03.110
Finally.

28:03.160 --> 28:05.070
But I also know that
everyone else does.

28:05.120 --> 28:10.000
As far they're concerned,
he's a prince and we - we're just us.

28:14.640 --> 28:17.150
This is my favourite view.

28:17.200 --> 28:21.600
I can see why.
Atlantis truly is a beautiful city.

28:22.920 --> 28:27.040
The last time we spoke, I asked
if I was your only suitor.

28:28.960 --> 28:30.870
Yes.

28:30.920 --> 28:32.240
And you did not answer.

28:37.360 --> 28:39.350
I must know if my hopes are futile.

28:39.400 --> 28:40.710
Must?

28:40.760 --> 28:42.480
I'm not very good at this.

28:45.120 --> 28:46.350
But if I cannot hope...

28:46.400 --> 28:49.080
~ That is not what I said.
~ It's what your silence said.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.400
There is someone.

28:57.560 --> 28:59.480
May I know the name of my rival?

29:00.760 --> 29:02.640
He is a man I can never marry.

29:04.400 --> 29:07.560
Sometimes the burden of
royal blood can be unbearable.

29:09.240 --> 29:11.840
But, given time,
these feelings may wane.

29:14.160 --> 29:17.920
And perhaps you could bring yourself
to feel the same for another?

29:20.720 --> 29:21.760
Perhaps.

29:38.520 --> 29:39.640
Come on, Jason.

29:46.960 --> 29:48.000
Aargh!

29:50.240 --> 29:51.360
Oh, he caught him.

30:40.400 --> 30:42.350
It'll need binding.

30:42.400 --> 30:43.950
The Gods smiled on you.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.560
Ariadne.

30:48.880 --> 30:50.480
You did Atlantis proud.

30:52.680 --> 30:53.720
And my Queen?

30:57.800 --> 30:59.750
I understand.

30:59.800 --> 31:03.600
No, you don't.
These are difficult times, Jason.

31:06.040 --> 31:09.110
My feelings for you have
not changed, but...

31:09.160 --> 31:11.070
You are Queen.

31:11.120 --> 31:14.120
Yes. Yes, I am.

31:19.680 --> 31:22.120
If you'll excuse me,
the games are not yet over.

31:24.400 --> 31:27.400
I pray with all my heart
that you will triumph.

31:34.880 --> 31:37.150
He's a fortunate man.

31:37.200 --> 31:39.830
She must think highly of him
to come down here in person.

31:39.880 --> 31:42.680
I don't presume to know
the Queen's mind.

31:44.520 --> 31:45.560
Of course.

31:59.320 --> 32:00.800
That's Leonidas there.

32:07.920 --> 32:08.960
Aargh!

32:11.160 --> 32:12.280
Aargh!

32:14.600 --> 32:15.960
He's good.

32:39.160 --> 32:40.200
Aargh!

32:56.320 --> 32:57.360
Aaargh!

33:03.200 --> 33:05.070
I thought you said he never loses?

33:05.120 --> 33:06.160
He doesn't.

33:27.800 --> 33:31.630
The Gods were not smiling
on you today, Leonidas.

33:31.680 --> 33:33.190
Indeed they weren't.

33:33.240 --> 33:36.150
Leonidas, he never loses.

33:36.200 --> 33:40.230
But today - it was almost as if
you had never fought before.

33:40.280 --> 33:45.190
You allowed Telemon to turn you to
face the sun - a beginner's mistake.

33:45.240 --> 33:48.070
Left your right side exposed.
You made it easy for him.

33:48.120 --> 33:49.310
He's a good fighter.

33:49.360 --> 33:51.190
But not as good as you. Not nearly.

33:51.240 --> 33:53.230
~ What happened? ~ I lost.

33:53.280 --> 33:56.870
You were winning. Winning one of the
most important fights of your life.

33:56.920 --> 33:58.350
I have to go now.

33:58.400 --> 34:00.040
I knew your father.

34:01.480 --> 34:03.680
We competed together many times.

34:05.080 --> 34:06.600
He was an honourable man.

34:11.360 --> 34:13.800
What happened, Leonidas?
Tell me the truth.

34:19.960 --> 34:22.230
He made it worth my while.

34:22.280 --> 34:23.710
Who?

34:23.760 --> 34:24.989
Telemon.

34:25.040 --> 34:26.590
Telemon paid you?

34:26.639 --> 34:28.070
Yes.

34:28.120 --> 34:29.159
How much?

34:30.880 --> 34:33.320
Enough never to have to
compete again.

34:36.840 --> 34:39.310
Why would Telemon need to cheat?

34:39.360 --> 34:41.909
He's a fine fighter,
he might have won anyway.

34:41.960 --> 34:44.159
He couldn't be sure,
though, could he?

34:45.600 --> 34:47.870
Can it really mean that much to him?

34:47.920 --> 34:50.190
To win a contest so far from home?

34:50.239 --> 34:52.790
He's not here to win the contest.

34:52.840 --> 34:55.190
He means to gain Ariadne's hand.

34:55.239 --> 34:56.429
All the same...

34:56.480 --> 34:59.080
And he knows only one man
stands in his way.

35:00.280 --> 35:01.550
Jason.

35:01.600 --> 35:04.190
Telemon had to be sure to face him
in the final.

35:04.240 --> 35:05.560
So he can kill him.

35:07.560 --> 35:10.110
I gave my word I would compete
and that's what I'm going to do.

35:10.160 --> 35:11.350
The city is depending on me.

35:11.400 --> 35:13.000
And that's the only reason?

35:14.320 --> 35:16.310
This has nothing to do with Ariadne.

35:16.360 --> 35:18.190
You will be walking into a trap.

35:18.240 --> 35:20.150
You don't know that.
You have no proof.

35:20.200 --> 35:21.430
Look what happened to Areto!

35:21.480 --> 35:23.950
~ She could have got that wound
months ago. ~ And Leonidas?

35:24.000 --> 35:26.630
Just because Telemon paid him
off - if, IF that is true,

35:26.680 --> 35:28.950
that doesn't mean that
he wants to murder me!

35:29.000 --> 35:31.110
It's the perfect place!

35:31.160 --> 35:34.870
If you die in the arena, people will
say it's the will of the Gods.

35:34.920 --> 35:36.350
No-one would suspect Telemon.

35:36.400 --> 35:38.190
He's a warrior, not a killer.

35:38.240 --> 35:40.070
He just wants to win,
like we all do.

35:40.120 --> 35:41.710
No - he wants Ariadne.

35:41.760 --> 35:44.030
And you are the only person
who stands in his way.

35:44.080 --> 35:47.310
~ That's completely... ~ He knows how
she feels about you, Jason.

35:47.360 --> 35:50.430
With you gone,
his path will be clear.

35:50.480 --> 35:53.830
Look, I swore that
I would fight for Atlantis!

35:53.880 --> 35:56.360
And I can't let the people down now.
I won't.

36:05.240 --> 36:06.840
Dion says you wish to see me?

36:08.000 --> 36:09.950
I thought perhaps
we might walk a while?

36:10.000 --> 36:12.750
I'm afraid I have many affairs
of state to attend to tonight.

36:12.800 --> 36:13.840
Of course.

36:15.120 --> 36:18.350
We have spoken of the great benefits
an alliance between

36:18.400 --> 36:20.710
~ our two cities would bring. ~ Indeed.

36:20.760 --> 36:23.800
~ I thought perhaps you might...
~ That I might give you an answer?

36:26.560 --> 36:28.550
It is not an insignificant decision.

36:28.600 --> 36:31.750
It is the most important
of our lives.

36:31.800 --> 36:34.480
And I will give it all
the consideration it deserves.

36:36.600 --> 36:39.120
I know of your feelings
towards Jason.

36:41.760 --> 36:44.080
But you both know
that union can never be.

36:46.360 --> 36:49.910
This is the fate
the Gods have decided for us.

36:49.960 --> 36:52.640
We cannot avoid it,
however much we may wish to.

36:53.960 --> 36:55.710
No-one can know their own fate.

36:55.760 --> 36:57.840
You can decide mine.

37:02.800 --> 37:04.800
I will give you my answer tomorrow.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.310
~ So that means...? ~ It means...

37:08.360 --> 37:11.200
I shall give you my answer tomorrow.

37:26.680 --> 37:29.000
It's not too late, you can still...

37:30.200 --> 37:31.640
May Poseidon be with you.

38:06.040 --> 38:08.760
~ Come on, Jason! ~ Come on, Jason!

38:17.480 --> 38:18.760
Oh, yes!

39:05.960 --> 39:07.190
That was unworthy of you.

39:07.240 --> 39:08.760
The idea is to win, is it not?

39:19.360 --> 39:20.720
You were lucky.

39:22.800 --> 39:24.400
It won't always be that way.

40:24.720 --> 40:26.310
How could I have been so stupid?!

40:26.360 --> 40:27.430
Keep still.

40:27.480 --> 40:28.910
We were all taken in.

40:28.960 --> 40:31.920
You weren't. You didn't believe him
from the start.

40:33.240 --> 40:34.630
I had my suspicions.

40:34.680 --> 40:38.510
You tried to warn me.
Why didn't I listen?

40:38.560 --> 40:41.120
Because you always think
the best of people.

41:10.160 --> 41:13.030
Dion said you would be here.

41:13.080 --> 41:15.190
It can't have been easy
to lose like that.

41:15.240 --> 41:19.670
Jason's a fine fighter - there is
no shame in losing to such a man.

41:19.720 --> 41:21.120
I hope not.

41:23.120 --> 41:26.040
You promised me
I would have your answer today.
