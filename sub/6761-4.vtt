01:33.915 --> 01:35.250
Brenda, I'm beginning to realize

01:35.333 --> 01:38.336
something very strange
about this place.

01:39.629 --> 01:43.591
There's no fall. It's November,
and we're in the middle of a heat wave.

01:43.675 --> 01:45.051
And a drought.

01:48.012 --> 01:51.474
Don't you miss that nip in the air
when the sun goes down?

01:51.557 --> 01:54.686
The leaves turning colors? You know
what color the leaves are here?

01:54.769 --> 01:56.896
Brown, and I don't mean
an autumn brown.

01:56.979 --> 01:59.857
I mean an unhealthy,
sickly kind of brown.

02:00.858 --> 02:02.610
You know
what the air quality index was today?

02:02.777 --> 02:03.820
But hold it!

02:04.070 --> 02:07.281
Doesn't it bother you that there is
such a thing as an air quality index?

02:07.365 --> 02:09.574
Something you have to check
every morning to find out

02:09.658 --> 02:11.285
whether or not it's safe to breathe?

02:12.411 --> 02:13.996
Brandon, it's not that bad.

02:14.080 --> 02:16.457
Minneapolis did not have
an air quality index

02:17.124 --> 02:18.751
or earthquakes.

02:20.461 --> 02:21.796
Do you really think about that?

02:23.422 --> 02:27.009
No. I've decided it's better not to.
But it doesn't matter

02:27.093 --> 02:30.012
whether you do or not
because it's just in the air out here.

02:30.179 --> 02:32.306
Like this big, looming thing.

02:33.307 --> 02:36.352
- Oh, God, I hope that's not for me.
- Why?

02:36.685 --> 02:40.356
Dad hates it when my friends call
past 11:00. He tells them I'm asleep.

02:40.648 --> 02:42.900
- It is so embarrassing.
- Bummer.

02:43.109 --> 02:46.862
Brandon, it's for you. It's Sheryl.

02:46.946 --> 02:48.322
Minneapolis Sheryl?

02:51.033 --> 02:52.326
Excuse me.

02:54.745 --> 02:55.788
Hi!

02:56.664 --> 02:58.123
Good. How are you doing?

02:59.708 --> 03:02.419
Oh, it's great, I love it out here.

03:02.503 --> 03:05.255
It's November and we're in the middle
of a heat wave!

03:07.383 --> 03:08.884
Of course I miss you.

03:12.304 --> 03:15.724
Yeah, really! You know I do.

03:21.480 --> 03:25.984
No, of course I don't want you to meet
somebody, but if you do, you do.

03:26.902 --> 03:29.154
Tomorrow? You're coming tomorrow?

03:29.988 --> 03:33.992
No, no! Tomorrow's great!
You can stay for the weekend.

03:36.036 --> 03:37.788
You know I want to see you.

03:39.706 --> 03:41.917
Of course, I'm glad you're coming.

03:42.250 --> 03:45.379
Hold on a second, okay? Hey...

03:46.296 --> 03:48.924
Guys, Sheryl's coming to visit
for the weekend.

03:49.091 --> 03:50.300
She can stay in my room.

04:14.157 --> 04:15.659
Hey, Andrea!

04:16.534 --> 04:18.327
Can you get someone
to cover the football game for me

04:18.411 --> 04:19.579
against Beverly High on Saturday?

04:19.663 --> 04:22.499
I thought you said that was supposed
to be one of the best games of the year.

04:22.582 --> 04:24.959
Well, it is.
But something real important came up.

04:25.043 --> 04:26.628
Right out of the blue.
Totally unexpected.

04:26.711 --> 04:29.422
- Who is she?
- What are you, psychic?

04:29.506 --> 04:31.883
No. Just a whiz at probability.

04:32.092 --> 04:34.385
Well, she's my old girlfriend
from Minneapolis.

04:34.469 --> 04:36.012
She's coming to visit me
for the weekend.

04:37.013 --> 04:38.848
So, why didn't you say so?

04:39.140 --> 04:41.518
I thought you might think
it was a lame excuse or something.

04:41.893 --> 04:44.062
Well, how long were you guys together?

04:44.145 --> 04:45.230
A year.

04:46.272 --> 04:50.401
- And then, what happened?
- Well, we cut each other loose.

04:50.652 --> 04:52.987
I don't believe in
long-distance relationships.

04:53.821 --> 04:57.241
A year. I didn't even know
you had a girlfriend, Brandon.

04:57.325 --> 04:59.952
Well, it just seems stupid to talk
about someone who's never around.

05:02.622 --> 05:05.625
- You're very secretive.
- And you're very nosy.

05:05.708 --> 05:08.586
I'm a journalist. I'm supposed to be.

05:13.216 --> 05:14.717
That's disgusting, what you said.

05:14.842 --> 05:17.720
You know what I haven't been able to
figure out ever since I've gotten here?

05:18.888 --> 05:21.974
How could somebody so gorgeous
be an Algebra teacher?

05:22.141 --> 05:24.560
I mean, it's like
he should be a lifeguard

05:24.644 --> 05:26.562
or ski instructor, or something.

05:26.687 --> 05:29.398
Yeah, he should definitely be
working outdoors.

05:29.565 --> 05:30.983
Or indoors.

05:32.234 --> 05:33.944
Are you ladies joining us,

05:34.028 --> 05:36.155
or should we move our seats
out into the hall today?

05:37.114 --> 05:40.034
- No, we're coming.
- Good.

05:40.159 --> 05:42.453
Class would be just empty
without you, Brenda.

05:44.663 --> 05:47.666
"Oh, class would just be empty
without you, Brenda."

05:47.750 --> 05:48.793
Shut up.

05:49.710 --> 05:53.214
See, the great thing about Sheryl
is that, not only is she beautiful,

05:53.297 --> 05:55.674
but she's got this incredible personality.

05:56.258 --> 05:59.011
I haven't met a girl out here yet
who can even compare with her.

05:59.094 --> 06:01.430
Brandon, I think your memory's
playing tricks on you.

06:01.513 --> 06:03.515
We have some major lookers
at this school.

06:03.599 --> 06:05.851
I know, but she's just more real.

06:05.935 --> 06:09.021
Give me a break. She sleeps with you,
of course you think she's special.

06:09.104 --> 06:10.147
I didn't say that.

06:10.230 --> 06:12.024
What, you mean
she doesn't sleep with you?

06:12.691 --> 06:14.610
Don't touch that!

06:17.780 --> 06:22.785
All of the equations on page 53
and 54 by tomorrow, people.

06:24.536 --> 06:29.500
- Brenda, could you stay a moment?
- Sure. I'll be out in a minute, okay?

06:29.792 --> 06:31.668
Sure. We'll be waiting.

06:33.670 --> 06:38.133
There's something I'd like to ask you,
and please, feel free to say no.

06:38.467 --> 06:41.178
- Okay.
- Run away with me, Brenda.

06:41.428 --> 06:44.431
Let's make a love nest
in some little alpine village

06:44.514 --> 06:46.141
where nobody knows our name.

06:46.808 --> 06:51.271
During the day I'll teach you skiing,
and at night we'll cuddle by the fire,

06:51.730 --> 06:55.776
drink hot cider, and think how lucky
we were to leave all of this behind.

06:56.651 --> 06:59.780
- Excuse me?
- I said, will you baby-sit for me

06:59.863 --> 07:01.114
and my wife on Saturday night?

07:02.199 --> 07:03.241
Oh.

07:03.950 --> 07:06.620
Oh, yeah. Sure, I'd love to.

07:06.703 --> 07:10.790
Terrific. Let me give you
the address here. Say, 8:00?

07:11.041 --> 07:12.250
Great.

07:18.006 --> 07:19.257
Nervous?

07:20.425 --> 07:22.135
No. Why should I be nervous?

07:22.218 --> 07:23.803
God, I can think of a million reasons.

07:23.887 --> 07:26.890
You've just moved to a new city, haven't
seen each other for a couple of months.

07:26.973 --> 07:28.975
You're probably wondering
if things will still be the same.

07:29.059 --> 07:31.770
She's probably thinking,
"I wonder if he's changed."

07:32.312 --> 07:34.064
Compounded by the fact
that you guys have

07:34.147 --> 07:36.649
this kind of weird,
open long-distance relationship,

07:36.733 --> 07:38.026
I'd think you'd be a wreck!

07:38.693 --> 07:41.780
No wonder you've been staring at
that flashing cursor for almost an hour.

07:41.863 --> 07:43.323
Don't you have a newspaper to edit?

07:43.865 --> 07:47.494
Yeah, but I thought
that you might want to talk, you know,

07:48.203 --> 07:49.412
get some of that anxiety out.

07:49.496 --> 07:52.665
Well, thanks, Andrea.
I feel so much better now.

07:53.750 --> 07:54.834
Where's she going to sleep?

08:02.675 --> 08:05.345
- Sorry, man.
- It's all right, it's okay.

08:05.428 --> 08:09.223
Oh, Brandon, take it easy, man.
I mean, she's just a girl, all right?

08:09.474 --> 08:12.518
Speaking of which, bring her by
the hotel. I'd like to meet this lady.

08:12.602 --> 08:13.853
All right, man.

08:16.314 --> 08:19.400
- Brandon, right?
- Yeah.

08:19.484 --> 08:22.528
David Silver.
Steve Sanders' friend. Remember?

08:23.196 --> 08:25.364
Yeah, sure, right. Yeah, yeah.

08:25.907 --> 08:28.618
He told me about your old girlfriend
coming out to visit.

08:29.118 --> 08:31.913
- He did?
- And I know exactly how you feel.

08:32.288 --> 08:35.707
See, I once went to camp with this girl,
Marla Melman. What a fox!

08:35.791 --> 08:39.587
I mean, she was only 12,
but already she was starting to develop,

08:39.794 --> 08:42.548
- know what I mean?
- Yeah, yeah, sure. Look, I gotta go.

08:43.299 --> 08:45.509
So anyway, we were hot and heavy
all summer, but

08:45.760 --> 08:48.471
she lived in Pittsburgh,
so once camp was over,

08:48.637 --> 08:52.266
it was a long-distance relationship
kind of thing. Kind of like you and...

08:52.349 --> 08:53.476
- Sheryl.
- Right.

08:53.559 --> 08:55.352
So anyway,
one day she calls me and says

08:55.436 --> 08:57.813
she's going to come out and visit.
Well, I was a total wreck.

08:58.147 --> 09:00.065
First of all, my skin broke out in the fall.

09:00.149 --> 09:02.693
And I'd never had a pimple before in my
life, and second of all...

09:02.776 --> 09:05.654
David, David, David, David,
bottom-line this for me, all right?

09:05.821 --> 09:08.908
Did she come out? Did you have
a good time? What? What happened?

09:09.658 --> 09:11.827
No, she never made it.
She got strep throat,

09:12.286 --> 09:14.663
and a week later, she met a guy
in the ninth grade,

09:14.747 --> 09:16.081
and I never talked to her again.

09:17.625 --> 09:18.751
That's great!

09:20.627 --> 09:22.463
See, I was nervous over nothing!

09:26.216 --> 09:29.511
Hey, slow down, hotshot. Her plane
doesn't get in for another three hours.

09:29.595 --> 09:31.638
I know, I know.
I just want to be prepared.

09:32.264 --> 09:34.850
- You're nervous, aren't you?
- No, I am not nervous.

09:35.517 --> 09:37.769
- You think I've changed?
- Oh, yeah.

09:38.020 --> 09:40.397
In fact, I don't even know
how she's going to recognize you.

09:47.779 --> 09:49.615
Maybe I should
get her some flowers, huh?

09:50.782 --> 09:52.034
I think it's too late for that.

09:52.117 --> 09:55.162
No, no, no, no.
I can always just go down to...

09:55.245 --> 09:56.663
Brandon, she's here.

10:02.961 --> 10:04.838
- Hi, how are you?
- Good.

10:04.921 --> 10:06.006
- What about you?
- Good.

10:06.131 --> 10:08.675
What are you doing here? You're not
supposed to be here until 8:00.

10:08.759 --> 10:10.218
I know. I took an earlier flight.

10:10.302 --> 10:12.929
We've been gabbing forever
just having the best time.

10:13.013 --> 10:14.264
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:15.849 --> 10:17.517
Sheryl's caught me up on all the gossip.

10:17.601 --> 10:20.270
You know, it's amazing how much
you miss in only a couple of months.

10:20.478 --> 10:23.565
- We'll see you guys later, right, Mom?
- Oh, right.

10:24.858 --> 10:26.693
- Listen, it's nice to have you here.
- Thanks.

10:26.776 --> 10:28.862
God, I can't believe
it is so warm out here.

10:28.945 --> 10:30.655
People in Minneapolis would die.

10:30.780 --> 10:32.866
I know, 90 degrees
in the beginning of November.

10:32.949 --> 10:36.244
- I know, it's unreal.
- Yeah, about sums it up.

10:46.045 --> 10:50.508
We're on pages 29, 53, 110, and 138.

10:50.967 --> 10:53.469
Not like you have this memorized
or anything.

10:54.179 --> 10:56.931
It was a great year.
Look, look at us here.

11:00.059 --> 11:02.854
- What?
- Did you always look this great?

11:04.230 --> 11:06.232
Compared to the girls out here?
I doubt it.

11:07.066 --> 11:10.236
- Better.
- For a while I wasn't sure if you'd...

11:14.157 --> 11:16.200
Oh, Sheryl, I just wanted to show you
where you'll be sleeping.

11:16.284 --> 11:17.410
We were just looking at the yearbook.

11:17.493 --> 11:19.871
Mom, I think I know
the way to Brenda's room.

11:20.663 --> 11:22.915
You go out the door, take a left,
another immediate left.

11:23.082 --> 11:26.085
- You can't miss it.
- All right. I was just trying to be helpful.

11:27.837 --> 11:29.172
Listen, Brandon,
when you have a minute,

11:29.255 --> 11:30.590
would you come down
and set up the grill?

11:30.673 --> 11:32.675
- Sure.
- Thanks.

11:37.680 --> 11:40.099
- I think she wants us in plain sight.
- Okay.

11:45.062 --> 11:48.733
- So, any new guys since you moved?
- Not yet.

11:48.899 --> 11:51.152
I mean, nobody I like
has asked me out or anything.

11:51.694 --> 11:55.698
Well, I bet you meet some
incredibly rich, good-looking guy.

11:56.198 --> 12:00.995
Well, actually, the cutest guy in school
is my Algebra teacher, Mr Brody.

12:01.620 --> 12:04.999
- Matt.
- Matt? Do you call him Matt to his face?

12:05.583 --> 12:07.168
No, I mean he's married and everything.

12:07.251 --> 12:09.211
It's not like we're having an affair,
Sheryl.

12:09.420 --> 12:12.006
- Oh, my God! That reminds me.
- What?

12:12.089 --> 12:13.966
Do you remember Ms Gebhart,
the gym teacher,

12:14.091 --> 12:16.010
- that we used to always say was gay?
- Yeah?

12:16.635 --> 12:18.887
Brian Sullivan married her
over the summer.

12:19.471 --> 12:22.057
Brian Sullivan, Senior Class President?

12:22.683 --> 12:24.643
I can't believe nobody called me!

12:28.856 --> 12:31.400
- Everybody asleep?
- Should be.

12:31.567 --> 12:33.026
Sheryl's sleeping in Brenda's room?

12:35.571 --> 12:38.907
- Think she'll stay there?
- Jim, you're terrible.

12:39.741 --> 12:40.909
She better.

12:51.003 --> 12:55.132
- I just wanted to say goodnight.
- Goodnight.

12:56.049 --> 12:57.718
Come into my room in an hour.

12:58.176 --> 13:00.178
Brandon, what if your parents
decide to check on us?

13:00.262 --> 13:05.183
They won't. I promise.
They sleep like the dead.

13:06.309 --> 13:07.477
Don't say no.

13:10.522 --> 13:13.942
We've waited so long.
I just wanted it to be special.

13:14.860 --> 13:18.071
Trust me. Right now, this is special.

13:19.156 --> 13:21.074
You just won't know until you do it.

13:21.616 --> 13:24.536
Then you'll look back and realize
how special it was.

13:26.538 --> 13:28.039
I don't know.

13:29.040 --> 13:30.166
Sheryl!

13:31.751 --> 13:33.086
Forty-five minutes.

13:36.256 --> 13:37.716
I have to think about it.

14:50.413 --> 14:51.706
- Hi.
- Hi.

15:03.884 --> 15:05.678
- Jim, Jim.
- What is it?

15:06.554 --> 15:08.556
- Just listen.
- I don't know.

15:16.689 --> 15:20.150
You know, if we had to move 2,000
miles to come and spend the night,

15:21.318 --> 15:22.861
I think it was worth it.

15:28.367 --> 15:31.078
Brandon, do you have protection?

15:32.788 --> 15:33.998
Of course.

15:35.332 --> 15:37.167
That's always been my problem.

15:37.793 --> 15:40.045
Lots of protection, but no one to protect.

15:41.463 --> 15:43.132
We can change that.

15:46.635 --> 15:49.596
- Jim, what if they're...
- What if they're what?

15:50.389 --> 15:53.725
Well, Sheryl is our houseguest.
We have a responsibility to her.

15:54.434 --> 15:57.437
I mean, what if it was Brenda spending
the night at her boyfriend's house?

15:57.646 --> 15:59.481
- Brenda doesn't have a boyfriend.
- Oh, Jim.

16:16.915 --> 16:19.501
Jim, I'm serious.

16:21.461 --> 16:23.880
- I'll talk to him.
- Now?

16:25.048 --> 16:27.843
Let's give them the benefit of the doubt.
I'll talk to him tomorrow morning.

16:28.969 --> 16:31.054
I really don't feel comfortable with this.

16:34.474 --> 16:36.309
Why do I suddenly feel so old?

16:38.687 --> 16:40.397
Come here.

16:42.774 --> 16:45.777
How am I ever gonna
get to sleep tonight?

17:29.362 --> 17:31.322
What's that music?

17:35.785 --> 17:37.912
You better have a talk with your son.

17:50.299 --> 17:51.342
Hey.

17:54.637 --> 17:56.722
- That was amazing, wasn't it?
- Uh-huh.

17:57.223 --> 17:58.933
I am really glad you're here.

17:59.266 --> 18:00.893
I didn't even realize
how much I'd missed you.

18:00.976 --> 18:02.061
Really?

18:02.436 --> 18:06.482
Hey, don't let me interrupt anything.
Fresh O.J.

18:07.149 --> 18:11.403
Trust me, he never does this.
So, what are you guys up to today?

18:11.862 --> 18:15.449
- I want to go see movie stars.
- Sheryl wants to go see movie stars.

18:16.200 --> 18:18.869
- Brandon, I did not go deaf overnight.
- Hey, I got a great idea.

18:18.953 --> 18:21.497
Why don't we get out of here, we'll grab
a bite on the road someplace?

18:21.580 --> 18:23.749
- Okay.
- Hey, Bren, tell Mom and Dad we...

18:23.832 --> 18:25.251
- Good morning.
- Isn't it?

18:25.417 --> 18:28.128
Hey, we're on our way out the door.
Sheryl wants to go see Tom Cruise.

18:28.295 --> 18:29.880
Oh, my God, I'd die.

18:29.964 --> 18:33.509
Hey, listen, fresh orange juice
on the counter. Enjoy it, big guy.

18:37.763 --> 18:39.306
He even strained the pulp.

18:54.154 --> 18:56.240
Oh, my God,
I'd do anything to live there.

18:56.698 --> 18:57.950
It's just a house.

18:58.033 --> 19:00.077
- Who do you think it belongs to?
- I don't know.

19:00.160 --> 19:02.079
I think it used to belong to Cher.

19:02.162 --> 19:03.580
Oh, my God!

19:27.020 --> 19:29.898
This place is amazing.
I want to move here.

19:29.981 --> 19:32.150
No, you don't.
You'd get homesick in a minute.

19:32.818 --> 19:35.403
I think you've got a warped view
of Minneapolis, Brandon.

19:51.044 --> 19:52.379
Well, I don't see anybody.

19:52.462 --> 19:54.381
I think you just brought me here
'cause you're hungry.

19:54.464 --> 19:56.591
Hey, come on,
these people have to eat, too.

19:56.925 --> 19:58.802
Besides, there's someone here
I want you to meet.

19:59.177 --> 20:01.679
Excuse me, do you know
any movie stars? Are they here?

20:01.805 --> 20:03.431
You'll be the first to know.

20:05.433 --> 20:06.476
So,

20:07.894 --> 20:10.104
isn't it great to finally be doing

20:10.188 --> 20:13.900
what everyone around you has been
talking about and doing for so long?

20:14.108 --> 20:16.569
Well, I never really cared
about what anybody else was doing.

20:16.694 --> 20:17.904
I know.

20:18.529 --> 20:22.200
- The timing was never right.
- Well, I guess we finally got it right.

20:23.409 --> 20:26.537
I thought I asked for
a no-kissing section.

20:26.621 --> 20:29.791
Hey, Dylan. This is Sheryl.

20:29.874 --> 20:32.919
- Yeah, I kind of figured as much. Hi.
- Hi.

20:33.252 --> 20:34.295
Sit down.

20:34.962 --> 20:36.506
Ah, just for a minute.

20:38.382 --> 20:41.636
Brandon speaks very highly of you.
I was beginning to think

20:41.719 --> 20:45.389
- he made you up.
- No. No, I'm real.

20:46.140 --> 20:49.560
- So, Dylan lives here at the hotel.
- Seriously?

20:50.853 --> 20:53.856
Well, if you two will excuse me,
I have to go to the washroom.

20:54.065 --> 20:56.359
Something movie stars do, by the way.

20:59.028 --> 21:01.113
So, are you into movie stars?

21:01.906 --> 21:04.450
I don't know.
I mean, it'd be fun to meet one.

21:05.618 --> 21:06.744
Why, do you know any?

21:06.827 --> 21:10.956
Yeah, a couple.
Well, you know, friends of my family.

21:11.791 --> 21:13.918
But I do know a club
where you may run into a few.

21:14.043 --> 21:15.086
Really?

21:15.961 --> 21:17.129
It's called Contact.

21:17.213 --> 21:21.717
It's private, but I think I can get us in.
I'll tell Brandon.

21:22.343 --> 21:25.846
- You guys have any plans tonight?
- I don't know, nothing definite.

21:26.597 --> 21:28.307
Nobody yet, honey.

21:28.891 --> 21:33.812
- So, you guys are pretty tight, huh?
- Who?

21:34.521 --> 21:37.650
- You and Brandon.
- We were. But he's out here

21:37.816 --> 21:39.943
where it's like paradise,
and I'm still back there

21:40.027 --> 21:42.613
where the only reason people wear
sunglasses this time of year

21:42.696 --> 21:44.031
is so they don't go snow-blind.

21:45.324 --> 21:47.451
- So, I guess life goes on, right?
- Yeah.

21:48.035 --> 21:51.163
But, well, to hear Brandon tell it,
you guys...

21:51.246 --> 21:53.707
Well, I wouldn't know.
I'm not around to hear it.

21:54.875 --> 21:57.544
- So, did you see anybody yet?
- No.

21:58.086 --> 22:01.006
But Dylan knows this great club.

22:06.220 --> 22:08.388
So, you ever heard of this place,
Contact?

22:09.473 --> 22:12.017
Yeah, but how are you ever
going to get in?

22:12.225 --> 22:14.436
This friend of Brandon's.
Some Dylan guy.

22:16.438 --> 22:19.399
Dylan's taking you, you'll get in.

22:20.108 --> 22:24.196
- What's his story, anyway?
- I haven't figured him out yet.

22:24.821 --> 22:27.074
He lives alone in that hotel.
Keeps to himself.

22:27.157 --> 22:28.617
He's a bit of a wild child.

22:29.451 --> 22:32.579
- Cool.
- So, how do you like this necklace?

22:32.788 --> 22:35.749
- Yeah, it's cute.
- Not too queer or dangly?

22:35.832 --> 22:37.959
Brenda, what's the big deal?
I thought you were just babysitting.

22:38.710 --> 22:42.547
I'm babysitting for Mr Brody.
That teacher that I told you about.

22:42.631 --> 22:44.758
Oh, my God. You mean
you're going to be in his house?

22:45.175 --> 22:47.093
You're going to meet his wife?

22:49.179 --> 22:50.639
Devastating.

22:52.974 --> 22:56.019
Jim, would you please go out there now
and talk to Brandon?

22:56.102 --> 22:57.812
I don't want a repeat of last night.

22:57.896 --> 23:01.107
First of all, "last night" is still
open to a lot of interpretation.

23:01.191 --> 23:03.943
We won't know the real story
until you talk to him, will we?

23:05.403 --> 23:08.490
All right, I'm going. We're talking.

23:08.990 --> 23:13.995
Jim, I just feel it's not
acceptable behavior in our house.

23:14.162 --> 23:17.248
Look, nobody said anything about
"acceptable" or "not acceptable."

23:17.790 --> 23:21.586
- The issue here is responsibility, right?
- Okay. Right.

23:22.086 --> 23:23.338
Good.

23:29.677 --> 23:32.472
Come on, ladies! Let's go!

23:37.310 --> 23:39.187
Yo, Dylan, we'll be right there!

23:40.646 --> 23:42.440
- Brandon...
- Come on, Brandon.

23:42.523 --> 23:45.359
- We're going to be late. Bye, Dad.
- Bye, Mr Walsh.

23:45.443 --> 23:48.529
- Bye, Dad. Bye, Mom.
- Have a good night, everyone.

23:52.492 --> 23:55.828
- What a cool car.
- Yeah, it's all right.

23:56.204 --> 23:58.122
- Can I get in?
- Sure.

23:58.289 --> 24:00.499
Come on, Sheryl,
we got to drop off Brenda.

24:00.625 --> 24:04.045
- Would you mind if I ride with Dylan?
- Sure, if that's what you want.

24:04.128 --> 24:07.048
I mean, when am I ever going to get
a chance to ride in a Porsche again?

24:07.256 --> 24:09.675
Brandon, can you possibly move
a little slower?

24:11.552 --> 24:15.389
- I'll see you there.
- Okay. I'll see you there.

24:24.273 --> 24:28.611
Wow! I can't believe I'm riding
around Beverly Hills in a Porsche.

24:28.819 --> 24:31.447
People back home would die
if they saw this!

24:49.590 --> 24:54.011
Brenda, is it just me, or is Sheryl
acting a little weird today?

24:54.803 --> 24:57.056
I don't know.
She seems the same to me.

24:57.347 --> 24:59.141
I thought you guys were having
a good time.

24:59.224 --> 25:04.313
Yeah, we are, we are. It's just she's
so into this whole Beverly Hills thing.

25:04.396 --> 25:08.859
- The houses, the stores, the cars.
- You mean like Dylan's car?

25:09.401 --> 25:11.236
Yeah, kind of.

25:12.487 --> 25:15.574
Didn't she seem just a little too
enthusiastic about getting a ride

25:15.657 --> 25:16.909
from him tonight?

25:17.951 --> 25:20.203
Well, take a look at the option.

25:20.621 --> 25:23.248
Obviously, she doesn't like me
for my car.

25:25.000 --> 25:28.003
Dylan didn't seem too unhappy
about the idea, either.

25:29.254 --> 25:31.840
Brandon, what are you saying?
You don't trust your own friend?

25:32.632 --> 25:34.551
- Which one?
- Both of them.

25:34.634 --> 25:37.596
Sure, of course I trust them, it's just...

25:39.139 --> 25:41.850
I think they're both just acting
a little weird, that's all.

25:42.225 --> 25:44.478
Well, I think
you're acting a little paranoid.

25:44.811 --> 25:45.937
Paranoid?

25:48.899 --> 25:51.443
- I hope you're right.
- I know I am.

25:51.651 --> 25:54.988
Look, I've got to go.
Have a good time tonight, okay?

25:55.697 --> 25:57.115
Yeah. You, too.

25:58.491 --> 26:00.368
Wish me luck
on my first babysitting job.

26:00.577 --> 26:01.911
Yeah, good luck.

26:07.500 --> 26:09.085
- Hi, Brenda.
- Hi.

26:09.377 --> 26:13.173
- Come on in. Oh, great necklace!
- Thanks.

26:15.341 --> 26:16.843
Nice toys.

26:17.969 --> 26:21.222
- Oh, sweetheart, this is Brenda.
- Hello.

26:21.681 --> 26:25.476
Matt, call Dan, tell him we're
running late. And not that jacket.

26:26.227 --> 26:27.312
Why not?

26:27.395 --> 26:30.231
Because you're wearing two shades
of the same color, that's why not.

26:30.815 --> 26:33.651
- Now, Brenda, this is Lisa and Elliot.
- Hi.

26:33.776 --> 26:38.489
- I don't need a babysitter.
- Let go of Mummy, please.

26:38.573 --> 26:40.408
Brenda's one of my best
Geometry students.

26:40.491 --> 26:41.534
Algebra.

26:42.285 --> 26:45.288
So you mentioned.
Now, Matt, hurry up and change.

26:46.122 --> 26:49.459
- We're never gonna make that movie.
- Elliot, guess what I have in my purse?

26:49.542 --> 26:50.626
Let me see!

26:50.710 --> 26:52.670
- Oh, Elliot!
- Hey, that was dumb.

26:52.753 --> 26:55.047
Yeah, but it was my candy.

26:57.008 --> 26:58.843
Get out of the way, you brat.

27:01.387 --> 27:03.514
You get out of the way, you little squirt!

27:10.938 --> 27:14.191
Hello! I've been out here for over
an hour! Am I wasting my time?

27:14.275 --> 27:17.028
Just tell me, am I wasting my time?

28:03.574 --> 28:06.452
- Hey.
- Hey, man, it's about time you got here.

28:06.535 --> 28:09.413
- I only had to crash my way in.
- Wait a minute, B,

28:09.496 --> 28:12.207
- I left your name with the bouncer.
- I guess he's got a real short memory.

28:12.291 --> 28:13.500
He did, Brandon.

28:13.959 --> 28:16.879
Listen, why don't you guys just tell me
when you're finished dancing, okay?

28:16.962 --> 28:19.047
Fine. I'm going to the restroom.

28:21.508 --> 28:23.969
- Man, she is wild!
- She's not.

28:24.052 --> 28:26.555
Well, she must be on sensory overload
or something.

28:26.638 --> 28:28.724
Listen, man. I think you're the only one
here on an overload.

28:28.807 --> 28:31.184
- What are you talking about?
- Dylan, you can probably go out with

28:31.268 --> 28:34.229
any girl in school that you want.
Why are you hitting on my girlfriend?

28:34.312 --> 28:36.565
Brandon, you're out of your mind.
I'm not hitting on her.

28:36.648 --> 28:38.483
Come on, Dylan,
I know how you operate.

28:38.567 --> 28:41.945
"I know this great club we can get into.
Look at my nice car.

28:42.070 --> 28:45.365
"No, no, let's just go in, Brandon will
find us. Let me buy you a drink."

28:45.449 --> 28:48.326
- That is not what happened here.
- It doesn't work with Sheryl.

28:48.410 --> 28:50.453
She's not into your car,
she's not into your cash

28:50.537 --> 28:51.746
- and she's only into one guy.
- You?

28:51.830 --> 28:52.914
That's right.

28:52.998 --> 28:55.250
Then I think you guys need to have
a serious talk, Brandon.

28:55.333 --> 28:59.337
As much as I hate to tell you this,
your girlfriend hit on me tonight.

29:12.475 --> 29:15.437
You better figure out
who your friends are.

29:33.162 --> 29:34.372
Come on. We're out of here.

29:34.455 --> 29:36.082
- Where's Dylan?
- What's the difference?

29:36.165 --> 29:37.917
This place is so cool.

29:38.001 --> 29:40.461
Once you get in, you don't even
get carded at the bar.

29:40.837 --> 29:42.714
There's nothing like this in Minneapolis.

29:42.797 --> 29:44.173
Yeah. How many of these
have you had tonight?

29:44.257 --> 29:46.843
I don't know. Dylan and I had a couple
before you got here.

29:46.968 --> 29:48.511
Yeah, well,
I think you've had one too many.

29:49.095 --> 29:50.972
Don't you ever tell me what to do.

29:51.097 --> 29:53.766
What's with you, Sheryl? This isn't you.

29:53.850 --> 29:57.311
How would you know? You haven't seen
me for six months. People change.

29:57.437 --> 29:59.313
Well, after last night,
I thought we'd be closer than ever.

29:59.397 --> 30:01.566
- Why, because I had sex with you?
- Yeah.

30:01.941 --> 30:03.359
Grow up, Brandon.

30:03.943 --> 30:06.737
Sex doesn't make people closer.
It only tears them farther apart.

30:06.821 --> 30:09.323
- And what makes you such an expert?
- Because I've done it before.

30:13.911 --> 30:17.623
- What are you talking about?
- It's no big deal. It just happened.

30:17.707 --> 30:20.001
- What to you mean, it just happened?
- What difference does it make?

30:20.084 --> 30:22.920
A hell of a lot of difference!
After you make me wait and...

30:23.421 --> 30:26.882
Who was it? Jack Taylor, huh?
He always wanted to jump your bones.

30:26.966 --> 30:29.593
It doesn't matter who, Brandon.
Besides, it's none of your business.

30:29.844 --> 30:32.096
We broke up
before you moved to California.

30:32.263 --> 30:35.724
Long distance relationships don't work.
Your words, remember?

30:35.891 --> 30:39.103
I want a name right now, or you can
get on the next bus back to Minneapolis.

30:39.186 --> 30:41.480
Fine. You don't have to ask me twice.
I'm gone.

30:50.990 --> 30:53.701
- Brenda, I'm bored.
- I'm bored, too.

30:53.826 --> 30:57.871
- I'm going to get something to eat.
- Lisa, wait!

30:59.498 --> 31:01.625
Elliot, let go, sweetie.

31:01.709 --> 31:03.377
- Brenda. Guess what.
- What?

31:03.460 --> 31:06.964
- My daddy has a penis.
- I'm sure he does.

31:07.214 --> 31:09.967
- And you know what?
- No. And I don't want to know.

31:10.384 --> 31:11.593
Elliot, let go.

31:13.470 --> 31:16.890
Elliot! Who is it?

31:16.974 --> 31:18.433
It's Kelly! And Donna!

31:18.517 --> 31:21.478
Mommy says never to open the door
for strangers.

31:21.854 --> 31:23.480
Thank you, Lisa.

31:24.481 --> 31:26.191
Oh, we just wanted to see
where he lived.

31:26.275 --> 31:28.402
You guys, this is
exactly what he doesn't want.

31:28.485 --> 31:30.320
Do you want to see my room?

31:30.404 --> 31:31.738
- Hi.
- Hi.

31:32.197 --> 31:35.200
- I've got makeup.
- Oh, that's great.

31:35.993 --> 31:37.786
You know, I bet you're going to be
a hunk when you grow up,

31:37.869 --> 31:39.162
just like your daddy.

31:40.247 --> 31:44.084
Ouch! Stop it! Brenda...

31:44.459 --> 31:47.629
- You've got long hair.
- I know, let go of it.

31:51.633 --> 31:52.843
Sheryl!

31:56.638 --> 31:58.181
Sheryl, wait!

32:09.567 --> 32:10.777
Damn.

32:20.203 --> 32:23.289
- Wow, look at him there.
- Oh, God, he was such a babe.

32:23.706 --> 32:26.000
Would you guys keep it down?
I think they're finally asleep.

32:26.209 --> 32:28.545
Brenda, check out this moustache.
Come here.

32:28.670 --> 32:30.004
What's that?

32:31.256 --> 32:34.384
- Where did you find his photo album?
- It was in his underwear drawer.

32:35.343 --> 32:36.970
I think we should put it back.

32:37.053 --> 32:39.889
Relax, they're not going to be home
for at least another hour.

32:40.056 --> 32:42.767
- I think he got married way too young.
- Oh, definitely.

32:44.269 --> 32:46.479
Oh, Brenda, would you look at him?

32:47.981 --> 32:49.065
What's going on?

32:49.148 --> 32:50.358
- Hi.
- Hi.

32:50.441 --> 32:52.360
- Hi.
- Hi, girls.

32:52.735 --> 32:55.154
Matt, what are they doing
with our photo album?

32:55.655 --> 32:57.699
Where did you find this?

32:58.616 --> 33:01.828
I'm sure that it was just lying around.

33:02.328 --> 33:04.539
I didn't think you'd be home so soon.

33:05.289 --> 33:08.876
Obviously. Such a pleasure to see
a bad movie and come back to this.

33:11.128 --> 33:15.132
Now, how much do we owe you?

33:16.342 --> 33:18.261
Whatever you think is right.

33:21.305 --> 33:22.974
I thought I was gonna puke.

33:24.725 --> 33:28.396
- I still say that he has a thing for you.
- Oh, absolutely.

33:29.313 --> 33:33.025
You know how you can be totally into
some guy, like Kiefer Sutherland,

33:33.234 --> 33:35.945
and then suddenly you see him
in a magazine one day and think,

33:36.195 --> 33:38.697
- "Where was my mind?"
- Yeah.

33:39.407 --> 33:41.575
That's how it was with Mr Brody tonight.

33:42.409 --> 33:44.411
Brenda is getting very mature.

33:45.454 --> 33:48.082
I'll see you guys later.
Thanks for the ride, Kel.

33:48.958 --> 33:50.167
Bye.

34:04.223 --> 34:06.433
Mom, what are you doing?

34:07.518 --> 34:09.311
Sheryl's mother just called
from Minneapolis

34:09.395 --> 34:10.562
completely out of her mind.

34:10.646 --> 34:12.063
Sheryl's been missing for three days.

34:12.147 --> 34:13.565
They didn't even know
she was out here.

34:13.649 --> 34:15.650
- What?
- Sheryl didn't just come out here

34:15.734 --> 34:18.402
to visit Brandon.
She ran away from home.

34:51.061 --> 34:54.481
- Dylan, Sheryl disappeared, man. I...
- I know.

34:55.023 --> 34:58.527
- She's here?
- Yeah, but look, it's not what you think.

34:58.652 --> 34:59.945
Come on.

35:04.741 --> 35:06.159
So where is she?

35:06.451 --> 35:09.329
Well, right now,
she's in my bathroom getting sick.

35:11.373 --> 35:14.668
I didn't hit on her, man. I swear.

35:15.293 --> 35:17.545
And she's not into me.
That's not what this is about.

35:17.629 --> 35:19.297
Then why don't you tell me
what this is about,

35:19.506 --> 35:21.257
'cause I'm feeling pretty clueless here.

35:21.716 --> 35:24.761
Ask Sheryl. Seems to me
you guys got a lot to talk about.

35:29.432 --> 35:31.309
You're not going to believe this, man,

35:31.643 --> 35:34.229
but I thought tonight
was going to be incredibly romantic.

35:35.230 --> 35:39.776
Welcome to the real world.
Brandon, the girl's got problems.

35:41.069 --> 35:43.196
Why does Beverly Hills
have this effect on people?

35:43.279 --> 35:47.116
Hey, don't put this off on Beverly Hills.
These problems go way back.

35:48.326 --> 35:50.995
- Hi.
- Hi.

35:51.704 --> 35:54.374
I'm going to slip out for a little while.

35:54.457 --> 35:56.626
Listen, if you need anything,
like clean towels or room service

35:56.709 --> 35:59.587
or whatever, call downstairs.
Tony will take care of you.

36:00.463 --> 36:02.799
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah.

36:07.762 --> 36:09.764
So, you want to tell me
what this is all about?

36:11.390 --> 36:13.184
You getting drunk,
running out of the club.

36:13.309 --> 36:15.436
You think you know
everything about me, don't you?

36:15.520 --> 36:17.980
That the way I am around you
is the way I am in the rest of my life.

36:18.147 --> 36:19.941
- What are you talking about?
- All you ever thought about

36:20.024 --> 36:22.026
when you moved was
how tough it was going to be on you.

36:22.735 --> 36:25.321
That you'd be in a strange city
and have to make new friends.

36:25.988 --> 36:28.616
- I thought you'd miss me.
- I did. I do.

36:28.699 --> 36:30.952
No, Brandon. Not like I missed you.

36:31.702 --> 36:33.663
You've got a new life,
you have new friends.

36:33.746 --> 36:36.207
I'm stuck with the same old problems
and the same old people.

36:36.290 --> 36:38.292
And what problems did you ever have?

36:38.376 --> 36:41.879
How about a stepfather I hate
and a mother that defends him,

36:42.630 --> 36:46.967
and a father that never calls me,
not even on my birthday?

36:47.259 --> 36:48.969
I didn't realize things were so bad.

36:49.303 --> 36:51.305
Because I didn't want
to put my problems on you.

36:51.388 --> 36:54.391
- Sheryl, I could have handled it.
- Well, I couldn't, Brandon.

36:57.811 --> 37:00.397
When we were together,
or with your family, I felt safe.

37:02.608 --> 37:04.318
I didn't have to think about things.

37:05.736 --> 37:09.239
So, you got me sweet and up and
always happy and ready for a good time.

37:09.323 --> 37:13.118
- But you didn't have to be that way.
- I liked myself that way.

37:13.786 --> 37:16.288
When you moved, Brandon,
it's like the whole world caved in on me.

37:16.914 --> 37:18.665
I couldn't be that way anymore.

37:19.875 --> 37:25.547
Hey, hey. Come here. It's okay.

37:26.882 --> 37:29.092
I thought if I came out to see you,
things would be better.

37:29.885 --> 37:31.970
But seeing you again
only made everything worse.

37:36.683 --> 37:37.935
Do you want to go home?

37:39.269 --> 37:42.064
I should at least call my mom,
let her know I came out to visit.

37:43.774 --> 37:45.150
Excuse me?

37:46.443 --> 37:49.363
That's right. One more thing
I forgot to tell you about.

37:50.238 --> 37:52.199
I ran away from home.

38:04.961 --> 38:07.672
- Who are you calling?
- Room service.

38:08.798 --> 38:11.593
Ice cream, Sheryl.
We need lots of ice cream.

38:11.885 --> 38:13.428
It's the only way to deal with this.

38:17.432 --> 38:20.936
Her mother is worried sick.
Sheryl's real father is accusing her

38:21.019 --> 38:22.646
of being an irresponsible parent.

38:22.896 --> 38:24.481
Did you know
her parents were divorced?

38:24.564 --> 38:26.358
- No.
- What about you, Brenda?

38:26.441 --> 38:27.734
Yeah, I think so.

38:27.817 --> 38:30.153
Well, evidently,
she was fighting with her stepfather.

38:30.236 --> 38:32.447
She left the house angry.
And that was it.

38:32.697 --> 38:34.365
Not a word for three days.

38:35.700 --> 38:39.579
- I think this explains last night.
- Why? What was last night?

38:40.330 --> 38:41.372
Nothing.

38:43.708 --> 38:45.293
Nothing. It was just...

38:46.586 --> 38:48.880
Well, Sheryl didn't sleep
in your room last night.

38:50.381 --> 38:51.883
- Brandon?
- Hello!

38:52.091 --> 38:53.468
Thank God.

38:54.552 --> 38:56.971
Mom, what are you still doing up?

38:57.055 --> 38:58.806
Sheryl, your mother called.

38:59.515 --> 39:00.683
Where's the phone?

39:01.017 --> 39:03.102
Try the one in my bedroom. It's private.

39:14.071 --> 39:17.408
I can't believe you're so calm.
Everything Brandon does is fine.

39:17.492 --> 39:19.577
If it was me, you would be freaking out.

39:19.994 --> 39:23.039
Sweetheart, I am freaking out.

39:25.374 --> 39:26.584
Brandon?

39:28.002 --> 39:29.545
You want to join me
for some ice cream?

39:29.754 --> 39:31.380
There's something
I want to talk to you about.

39:31.964 --> 39:33.466
Can it wait until tomorrow, Dad?

39:34.091 --> 39:36.844
I think I've had all the ice cream
I can handle for one night.

39:44.935 --> 39:47.146
- Hi.
- Hi.

39:48.522 --> 39:50.733
- May I come in?
- Sure.

39:56.572 --> 39:58.199
Thought I really knew her, Brenda.

39:59.658 --> 40:01.243
But there was this huge gap between

40:01.327 --> 40:04.163
the Sheryl I wanted her to be
and the Sheryl she really is.

40:05.164 --> 40:07.291
I guess I couldn't see the problems
or the hurt because

40:09.084 --> 40:11.045
I never took the time
to really notice them.

40:11.962 --> 40:13.797
You can't see
what people won't let you see.

40:13.964 --> 40:15.841
Yeah, but I thought we were so close.

40:16.717 --> 40:18.469
I mean, she knew everything about me.

40:19.803 --> 40:21.930
Even how you used to eat
Mom's makeup?

40:22.347 --> 40:24.558
I guess we didn't share all our secrets.

40:27.728 --> 40:29.229
Well, it's never too late.

40:30.355 --> 40:32.941
Feels like the only thing
I want to say right now is goodbye.

40:33.942 --> 40:35.986
Hey, it's a start.

40:53.337 --> 40:54.588
Sure I can't take you?

40:55.422 --> 40:57.257
That's what an airport shuttle's for,
Brandon.

40:59.134 --> 41:01.178
Well, at least you're flying home.

41:02.220 --> 41:04.431
Yeah, it's amazing how generous
parents become

41:04.639 --> 41:06.183
when you push them to the wall.

41:08.310 --> 41:11.688
- Are you guys going to work things out?
- No choice.

41:13.940 --> 41:16.318
Real estate is a little steep out here
for me right now.

41:17.444 --> 41:20.447
But give me a couple of years.
I'll be back.

41:29.664 --> 41:31.791
Well, it was an experience.

41:34.794 --> 41:36.588
I'm sorry, Brandon.

41:37.130 --> 41:38.173
So am I.

41:38.381 --> 41:41.801
There's something I want you to know.
The other night, when we made love,

41:43.344 --> 41:46.347
it was special.
I know it wasn't my first time,

41:46.431 --> 41:50.518
and you may never forgive me for that.
But trust me, it was different.

41:51.186 --> 41:53.563
- How?
- It was like it was supposed to be.

41:54.772 --> 41:56.441
Like I always imagined it would be.

41:59.235 --> 42:01.904
I guess 'cause my feelings for you
are so intense.

42:02.697 --> 42:06.451
That, and the way you held me after.
It's something I'll never forget.

42:08.077 --> 42:09.245
Never.

42:11.998 --> 42:13.916
So, who was it, Sheryl?

42:15.293 --> 42:17.336
Don't you understand? It doesn't matter.

42:18.045 --> 42:20.923
It was meaningless.
That's something I've got to live with.

42:22.967 --> 42:25.678
- But it did make me realize one thing.
- What's that?

42:29.098 --> 42:30.516
I got to go.

42:37.648 --> 42:42.778
Sheryl, wait! Sheryl!
Sheryl, wait a second.

42:43.446 --> 42:45.489
What did it make you realize?

42:46.782 --> 42:49.994
Brandon, you are a wonderful lover.

43:07.887 --> 43:09.597
Practicing behind my back again, huh?

43:09.680 --> 43:11.473
Nothing but catch-up once you pass 40.

43:13.517 --> 43:16.228
Well, just don't start asking me
for handicaps, all right?

43:22.234 --> 43:23.527
Sheryl get off okay?

43:25.070 --> 43:27.281
- You disappointed?
- What, in her?

43:29.575 --> 43:31.201
Yes and no.

43:32.077 --> 43:33.454
I mean, no one's perfect, right?

43:33.996 --> 43:36.081
When I was your age,
my father told me that

43:36.790 --> 43:38.750
someday I'd meet a girl
who would break my heart.

43:39.334 --> 43:42.504
And then I'd meet one who wouldn't.
I told him he was crazy.

43:42.588 --> 43:44.506
I said I'd never let a girl do that to me.

43:44.840 --> 43:47.968
But it happened, maybe twice,
maybe three times.

43:48.802 --> 43:49.845
Then I met your mom.

43:51.013 --> 43:52.848
Dad, Sheryl didn't break my heart.

43:55.017 --> 43:58.562
The point is that you're not going
to know who the heartbreaker is

43:58.645 --> 44:00.480
and who the special one is
right off the bat.

44:00.939 --> 44:03.442
Who knows, you may break a few hearts
yourself along the way.

44:03.984 --> 44:06.987
- It's all going to take time.
- What are you getting at?

44:07.362 --> 44:10.866
It's just that
every relationship is special, Brandon.

44:11.867 --> 44:13.618
You need to act responsibly.

44:20.417 --> 44:22.127
Are you talking about sex?

44:23.461 --> 44:25.380
Actually, I'm talking about love.

44:27.465 --> 44:30.510
Why, is there something
that you need to ask me about sex?

44:30.594 --> 44:32.762
Dad, we had this conversation
when I was 10.

44:33.555 --> 44:34.973
Is there anything new since then?

44:35.724 --> 44:38.184
Well, I don't know. You tell me.

44:40.812 --> 44:43.148
Just tell Mom we were careful, okay?

44:44.607 --> 44:45.775
All right.

44:47.694 --> 44:48.945
Is there anything else?

44:49.529 --> 44:52.115
Come on, Dad. You're the one
who taught me never to kiss and tell.

44:52.407 --> 44:53.867
Hey, hey, hey!

44:55.827 --> 44:57.912
- That's 2-0.
- Nobody said we were playing.
