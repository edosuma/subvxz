09:53.610 --> 09:56.320
At some point you'll be
too old to drive, turning

09:56.320 --> 09:58.540
your house into a prison.

09:58.540 --> 10:01.780
If I can't drive,
how will I live?

10:01.780 --> 10:04.840
There isn't even a grocery
store in walking distance.

10:04.840 --> 10:06.970
ADAM CONOVER (VOICEOVER): And
so, even after a little Donovan

10:06.970 --> 10:10.450
moves away, he'll still be
tied to this cul-de-sac,

10:10.450 --> 10:11.640
to help you.

10:11.640 --> 10:14.290
No, go live your own life.

10:14.290 --> 10:15.940
At that point,
you'll be reliant

10:15.940 --> 10:18.100
on others to keep you alive.

10:18.100 --> 10:21.850
By 2035 over 50 million
Americans will be facing

10:21.850 --> 10:24.280
that same dilemma,
many who don't even

10:24.280 --> 10:26.080
have a family to help them.

10:26.080 --> 10:29.920
And unfortunately, we don't
have an easy or affordable way

10:29.920 --> 10:30.730
to fix it.

10:30.730 --> 10:33.190
The fact is, the
design of the suburbs

10:33.190 --> 10:35.540
actually makes you
less independent,

10:35.540 --> 10:37.790
less healthy, and less safe.

10:37.790 --> 10:38.680
Little Donovan, no!

10:38.680 --> 10:40.090
Get out of the street!

10:40.090 --> 10:43.300
Come on chalky bush
boy, take me back.

10:43.300 --> 10:45.270
I'm going to break the record!

10:45.270 --> 10:46.750
Time me Lorraine Hamilton!

10:51.470 --> 10:54.140
Stop!
Little Donovan!

10:54.140 --> 10:56.610
[CAR CRASH]

10:56.610 --> 10:57.590
Lorraine Hamilton!

10:57.590 --> 10:59.090
No!

10:59.090 --> 11:01.400
Lorraine Hamilton was real?

11:01.400 --> 11:03.330
Oh my god, you were right.

11:03.330 --> 11:06.270
The suburbs are nothing but
an isolating hell scape filled

11:06.270 --> 11:08.130
with constant car crashes.

11:08.130 --> 11:09.690
Well, we did exaggerate
the car crashes

11:09.690 --> 11:11.310
a little for comedic effect.

11:11.310 --> 11:14.930
But this place will still give
little Donovan a better life.

11:14.930 --> 11:16.140
Know why?

11:16.140 --> 11:18.810
Because of the schools.

11:18.810 --> 11:21.000
The suburbs have
the best schools

11:21.000 --> 11:22.570
and there's no downside to that.

11:22.570 --> 11:25.480
Actually, suburban schools
have a ton of downsides.

11:25.480 --> 11:27.000
But I'll tell you
about it in a second,

11:27.000 --> 11:28.350
we should really help Lorraine.

11:28.350 --> 11:29.480
Oh yeah, good idea.

11:32.410 --> 11:34.930
Here you go pal, bologna
sandwich and milk.

11:34.930 --> 11:39.880
I know you wanted whiskey,
but we're all out you lush.

11:39.880 --> 11:42.650
Drunk kid reference.

11:42.650 --> 11:43.810
It's fun again.

11:43.810 --> 11:45.550
Dad, can we play catch?

11:45.550 --> 11:47.380
Not until you
finish your homework.

11:47.380 --> 11:50.590
We moved to the suburbs so
you could go to a good school.

11:50.590 --> 11:54.250
And apparently, that is the
only solid, un-ruinable reason

11:54.250 --> 11:55.700
to be here.

11:55.700 --> 11:56.820
ADAM CONOVER: Not quite.

11:56.820 --> 11:57.970
Oh, no.

11:57.970 --> 11:58.750
You're right.

11:58.750 --> 12:01.330
Schools are often
better in the suburbs,

12:01.330 --> 12:03.640
but have you ever wondered
why they're better?

12:03.640 --> 12:04.480
That's easy.

12:04.480 --> 12:07.830
Better facilities, better
teachers, more funding.

12:07.830 --> 12:08.530
Right.

12:08.530 --> 12:11.400
And how did your school
get those advantages?

12:11.400 --> 12:12.100
I don't know.

12:12.100 --> 12:14.420
We're just in a good
community, I guess.

12:14.420 --> 12:18.670
And which groups of people
get to live in this community?

12:18.670 --> 12:22.450
Wait, you're not saying
this is a White thing are you?

12:22.450 --> 12:25.500
It's not so White here, look.

12:25.500 --> 12:26.510
Bad example.

12:26.510 --> 12:28.350
Ignore sweater dog people.

12:28.350 --> 12:29.650
A tote bag full of kale.

12:29.650 --> 12:31.340
You're killing me, lady.

12:31.340 --> 12:35.200
OK, maybe this neighborhood
is mostly too--

12:35.200 --> 12:37.820
completely too--
insufferably White.

12:37.820 --> 12:40.660
But that's just the
way things are here.

12:40.660 --> 12:42.470
It doesn't mean we're racist.

12:42.470 --> 12:44.110
I'm sure you're not, Ron.

12:44.110 --> 12:47.140
But the fact that so many
suburbs are mostly White

12:47.140 --> 12:48.460
is no accident.

12:48.460 --> 12:52.000
It's the result of decades
of racist federal policies

12:52.000 --> 12:54.070
that affect us to this day.

12:54.070 --> 12:54.810
Look.

12:54.810 --> 12:56.680
Hooray, games!

12:56.680 --> 12:58.690
What the heck kind
of game is this?

12:58.690 --> 13:03.150
It's Settlers of the
Suburbs, redlining edition.

13:03.150 --> 13:04.080
Cool.

13:04.080 --> 13:06.030
Little Donovan, you be green.

13:06.030 --> 13:07.180
Ron, you're red.

13:07.180 --> 13:10.090
All right, red,
just like the name.

13:10.090 --> 13:12.190
Looks like I've
got the advantage.

13:12.190 --> 13:13.780
No, you don't.

13:13.780 --> 13:17.120
See, in the 1930s as
part of the New Deal,

13:17.120 --> 13:19.480
FDR created loan
programs to help

13:19.480 --> 13:21.520
Americans finance their homes.

13:21.520 --> 13:23.890
But to decide who
got those loans,

13:23.890 --> 13:26.350
the government created
color-coded maps

13:26.350 --> 13:28.460
in which green
neighborhoods were good,

13:28.460 --> 13:30.490
and red neighborhoods were bad.

13:30.490 --> 13:34.520
This practice became
known as redlining.

13:34.520 --> 13:36.140
Because of these
policies if you lived

13:36.140 --> 13:37.580
in the green
neighborhoods it was

13:37.580 --> 13:39.200
super easy to get a home loan.

13:39.200 --> 13:41.140
All right, I can buy property.

13:44.130 --> 13:48.170
But for folks in the red
areas, no loans were available.

13:48.170 --> 13:50.810
I can barely afford
rent with this.

13:50.810 --> 13:51.620
That's no fair.

13:51.620 --> 13:53.420
The red areas are screwed.

13:53.420 --> 13:54.800
Yeah, they were.

13:54.800 --> 13:57.770
And do you know why some
areas were designated as red?

13:57.770 --> 13:59.780
No, but I can guess.

13:59.780 --> 14:02.240
Those were the neighborhoods
where African-Americans

14:02.240 --> 14:04.850
and other minorities
lived, and redlining

14:04.850 --> 14:08.150
systematically prevented
them from getting home loans.

14:08.150 --> 14:09.730
Well, I know what I'll do.

14:09.730 --> 14:12.020
I'll just take my
little guy and put

14:12.020 --> 14:14.060
him in the green neighborhood.

14:14.060 --> 14:16.460
Sorry, that's
against the rules.

14:16.460 --> 14:18.530
Early suburb developers
like William Levitt

14:18.530 --> 14:21.690
instituted explicitly
racist policies.

14:21.690 --> 14:23.750
Levittown homes
must not be used

14:23.750 --> 14:26.900
or occupied by any
person other than members

14:26.900 --> 14:29.000
of the Caucasian race.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.520
And the federal
government itself encouraged

14:31.520 --> 14:33.110
developers to discriminate.

14:33.110 --> 14:36.770
Developers, I want you
to exclude non-Whites

14:36.770 --> 14:40.850
The result of these policies
is that from 1934 through 1968

14:40.850 --> 14:46.070
a whopping 98% of home loans
were given to White families.

14:46.070 --> 14:47.000
Yes!

14:47.000 --> 14:48.770
OK, this is not fair.

14:48.770 --> 14:51.650
I did not get to pick what
color I was when I started.

14:51.650 --> 14:53.720
Yeah, no one does.

14:53.720 --> 14:56.480
And this advantage
compounded over time.

14:56.480 --> 14:58.730
The families in the green,
or White neighborhoods

14:58.730 --> 15:01.320
were able to purchase
homes and accrue wealth.

15:01.320 --> 15:02.840
The market went up.

15:02.840 --> 15:04.750
I can sell my house
and buy a bigger one.

15:07.340 --> 15:09.290
Whereas the people in
the red neighborhoods

15:09.290 --> 15:12.080
got none of those opportunities.

15:12.080 --> 15:13.670
I can't afford property.

15:13.670 --> 15:16.310
I'm behind on my electric bill.

15:16.310 --> 15:19.190
In the green neighborhoods,
the influx of new wealth

15:19.190 --> 15:21.350
attracted new business.

15:21.350 --> 15:24.210
Whoa, we got an
organic grocery.

15:24.210 --> 15:27.160
Which caused property
values to go up.

15:27.160 --> 15:29.570
Which meant White families
could sell their homes

15:29.570 --> 15:32.510
and send their kids to college.

15:32.510 --> 15:34.220
They grow up so fast.

15:34.220 --> 15:36.290
Passing down their
wealth and advantages

15:36.290 --> 15:39.740
to future generations.

15:39.740 --> 15:41.630
Meanwhile, the red
neighborhoods had

15:41.630 --> 15:44.150
far less ability to
build wealth and many

15:44.150 --> 15:46.500
remain trapped in poverty.

15:46.500 --> 15:47.840
This game is rigged.

15:47.840 --> 15:49.310
Yeah, it was.

15:49.310 --> 15:51.350
That's why laws were
eventually passed

15:51.350 --> 15:54.050
that made most of these
discriminatory practices

15:54.050 --> 15:55.790
illegal.

15:55.790 --> 15:56.780
Great.

15:56.780 --> 15:59.510
Finally, I can move.

15:59.510 --> 16:01.490
I don't have enough money.

16:01.490 --> 16:02.450
Exactly.

16:02.450 --> 16:04.910
Without wealth, families
in the red neighborhoods

16:04.910 --> 16:07.640
couldn't afford to move up,
keeping these communities

16:07.640 --> 16:09.260
separated by race.

16:09.260 --> 16:12.350
Today, 70 years after
Levittown was created,

16:12.350 --> 16:15.320
it's still less than 1% Black.

16:15.320 --> 16:19.310
I may be dead, but the
effect of my racism lives on.

16:19.310 --> 16:21.380
And if the neighborhoods
are segregated,

16:21.380 --> 16:24.180
that means the schools are too.

16:24.180 --> 16:25.730
What?

16:25.730 --> 16:28.970
No, no, that can't be true.

16:28.970 --> 16:32.300
We ended school segregation
back in the '60s.

16:32.300 --> 16:34.670
Sorry Ron, but I'm
afraid that's not true.

16:34.670 --> 16:36.740
Ron, this is
Nicole Hannah-Jones.

16:36.740 --> 16:38.570
She's a New York Times
investigative reporter

16:38.570 --> 16:40.550
who covers civil rights
issues, including

16:40.550 --> 16:42.560
school and housing segregation.

16:42.560 --> 16:44.440
Nicole, would you mind
telling Ron what most people

16:44.440 --> 16:46.250
get wrong about segregation?

16:46.250 --> 16:47.840
People tend to
think of segregation

16:47.840 --> 16:50.630
as an archaic term for
Jim Crow policies that led

16:50.630 --> 16:52.790
to the civil rights movement.

16:52.790 --> 16:54.680
But the truth is
that Black children

16:54.680 --> 16:56.690
are more segregated
in schools now then

16:56.690 --> 16:59.050
in any time since the 1970s.

16:59.050 --> 17:01.130
And in the US,
schools are largely

17:01.130 --> 17:03.410
funded by property taxes.

17:03.410 --> 17:05.360
Since property values in
the White neighborhoods

17:05.360 --> 17:07.160
are so much higher,
their schools

17:07.160 --> 17:10.550
get way more money to spend
on things like facilities,

17:10.550 --> 17:12.650
teachers, and supplies.

17:12.650 --> 17:13.940
On the other
hand, predominately

17:13.940 --> 17:16.760
Black and Latino schools
are massively underfunded.

17:16.760 --> 17:19.910
They're less likely to have
AP, science, and math courses.

17:19.910 --> 17:22.250
And they're the least likely to
have experienced and qualified

17:22.250 --> 17:22.950
teachers.

17:25.550 --> 17:27.830
The truth is, little
Donovan doesn't just

17:27.830 --> 17:31.740
go to the best school, he
goes to a segregated school.

17:31.740 --> 17:33.260
No, no, no.

17:33.260 --> 17:35.330
This is a direct
result of decades

17:35.330 --> 17:38.160
of redlining policies
enacted by our own government

17:38.160 --> 17:39.830
to build the suburbs.

17:39.830 --> 17:42.560
Highways that were built to make
access to the suburbs easier

17:42.560 --> 17:44.930
for White Americans
were often run

17:44.930 --> 17:47.150
right through Black,
middle class neighborhoods,

17:47.150 --> 17:48.350
destroying them.

17:48.350 --> 17:51.020
People in the
past were the worst.

17:51.020 --> 17:52.610
It's not just the past.

17:52.610 --> 17:56.150
Banks still regularly charge
Black homebuyers higher rates

17:56.150 --> 17:58.100
on loans then they
do White homebuyers,

17:58.100 --> 18:00.160
even when they have
the same credit.

18:00.160 --> 18:02.600
Worst of all, Black
and Latino home seekers

18:02.600 --> 18:05.540
still experience 4 million
incidents of illegal housing

18:05.540 --> 18:07.710
discrimination every year.

18:07.710 --> 18:10.920
But, I mean, I didn't
do any of that stuff.

18:10.920 --> 18:14.660
I'm not racist, and I worked
hard to get this house.

18:14.660 --> 18:17.150
Of course, but
without realizing it

18:17.150 --> 18:19.820
you've also gotten a leg
up from America's history

18:19.820 --> 18:21.980
of racist housing policies.

18:21.980 --> 18:26.480
The suburb you live in was built
on a foundation of segregation.

18:26.480 --> 18:29.000
We can't close our eyes to that.

18:29.000 --> 18:32.810
You know what, I don't think
I want to raise little Donovan

18:32.810 --> 18:34.250
in a place like this.

18:34.250 --> 18:35.480
Well, don't despair.

18:35.480 --> 18:36.920
There are things you can do--

18:36.920 --> 18:38.660
Save your breath, OK.

18:38.660 --> 18:40.280
Go pack your things, buddy.

18:40.280 --> 18:42.390
I'm selling this house.

18:42.390 --> 18:44.920
Oh man, this is why
nobody finishes board games.

18:48.670 --> 18:52.620
[MUSIC PLAYING]

18:52.620 --> 18:53.350
Hello everyone.

18:53.350 --> 18:55.620
We're here on set on Adam
Ruins Everything with Nicole

18:55.620 --> 18:57.120
Hannah-Jones because
I have way more

18:57.120 --> 19:00.550
questions about housing and
school segregation in America.

19:00.550 --> 19:02.460
So this topic is
such a stunning one

19:02.460 --> 19:04.500
because I grew up,
like I think a lot

19:04.500 --> 19:06.390
of kids my age did
in America, being

19:06.390 --> 19:09.160
told that we ended segregation.

19:09.160 --> 19:12.840
But American society is not
as integrated as the story

19:12.840 --> 19:14.910
that we tell ourselves.

19:14.910 --> 19:17.110
I mean, why do
you think that is?

19:17.110 --> 19:19.950
Well, one, I think often
when we hear about segregation

19:19.950 --> 19:21.750
we think of this as a
Southern phenomenon,

19:21.750 --> 19:23.940
as something that
happened way back then

19:23.940 --> 19:25.770
and happened way down there.

19:25.770 --> 19:28.320
But the truth is, the most
segregated parts of the country

19:28.320 --> 19:29.730
have long been in the North.

19:29.730 --> 19:32.280
The difference is, in the South
because often Black people

19:32.280 --> 19:35.160
lived quite intimately
with White Americans,

19:35.160 --> 19:36.600
then you would have
laws that would say

19:36.600 --> 19:37.980
you couldn't go to
the swimming pool,

19:37.980 --> 19:39.540
or you couldn't
go to this school.

19:39.540 --> 19:42.390
In the North, you can keep
your neighborhood White,

19:42.390 --> 19:44.490
then you can keep your swimming
pools, and your libraries,

19:44.490 --> 19:46.110
and your restaurants
White because there

19:46.110 --> 19:48.090
are no Black people
living in proximity.

19:48.090 --> 19:50.580
You don't have to have a rule
that says no Black kids can

19:50.580 --> 19:52.020
swim in this pool
or go to this school

19:52.020 --> 19:54.210
because there just
are none in the area

19:54.210 --> 19:55.830
because that's how things
have been engineered.

19:55.830 --> 19:58.710
We passed laws and said,
OK, this is no longer legal.

19:58.710 --> 20:00.480
But we didn't put any
effort into actually

20:00.480 --> 20:02.720
undoing the segregation
that we created.

20:02.720 --> 20:06.210
It would require an equal or
even greater amount of effort

20:06.210 --> 20:08.430
to undo the segregation
as it took to create

20:08.430 --> 20:09.620
it in the first place.

20:09.620 --> 20:11.190
We've never had the
will to do that.

20:11.190 --> 20:13.950
It's not like when we passed
the Fair Housing Law in 1968

20:13.950 --> 20:16.950
we started over and we equalized
all the housing values.

20:16.950 --> 20:18.870
We just continued with
that, and so those White

20:18.870 --> 20:23.310
neighborhoods continued to see
their property values rise.

20:23.310 --> 20:24.630
And Black
neighborhoods would see

20:24.630 --> 20:26.730
the property values
rise as well but they

20:26.730 --> 20:28.990
started so much further behind.

20:28.990 --> 20:31.230
So it's not saying that
White people haven't

20:31.230 --> 20:33.750
worked for anything,
because clearly White

20:33.750 --> 20:34.950
Americans have worked hard.

20:34.950 --> 20:37.750
So have Black Americans,
they just were disadvantaged.

20:37.750 --> 20:39.300
So back to schools.

20:39.300 --> 20:42.540
I mean, people seem like they
want to integrate schools more,

20:42.540 --> 20:43.950
you know.

20:43.950 --> 20:45.630
What are the barriers
to doing that?

20:45.630 --> 20:47.460
Even in neighborhoods
that are integrating,

20:47.460 --> 20:48.690
the schools are not.

20:48.690 --> 20:50.870
And that's kind of the
last line in the sand,

20:50.870 --> 20:52.170
White people are
afraid if they put

20:52.170 --> 20:53.940
their children into
a diverse school it's

20:53.940 --> 20:55.260
going to harm their children.

20:55.260 --> 20:56.570
Well, and it's
my understanding--

20:56.570 --> 20:57.900
I don't know the
research top to bottom,

20:57.900 --> 20:59.910
but it's my understanding
that diverse schools

20:59.910 --> 21:01.380
are good for all students.

21:01.380 --> 21:02.410
Is that correct?

21:02.410 --> 21:03.450
Absolutely.

21:03.450 --> 21:05.970
Diverse schools for
Black and Latino children

21:05.970 --> 21:08.700
ensure that they actually get
the same resources that White

21:08.700 --> 21:11.020
children get in
terms of instruction,

21:11.020 --> 21:13.230
curriculum, quality teachers.

21:13.230 --> 21:15.960
For White children,
it actually helps them

21:15.960 --> 21:17.260
to be able to think better.

21:17.260 --> 21:19.110
They become better
problem solvers.

21:19.110 --> 21:21.570
And you can think about this,
if you work at a business

21:21.570 --> 21:23.100
and everyone grew
up exactly the same

21:23.100 --> 21:24.630
and everyone thinks
exactly the same,

21:24.630 --> 21:26.910
you all come up with the
same answers to the problems.

21:26.910 --> 21:29.370
When you are dealing with people
who have different experiences

21:29.370 --> 21:31.590
and have different
ways of processing,

21:31.590 --> 21:33.000
then you can find solutions.

21:33.000 --> 21:36.420
Look, clearly this is a
huge, huge systemic problem

21:36.420 --> 21:38.870
in our society that's going
to take a long time to fix.

21:38.870 --> 21:42.480
But what can we do on an
individual level to address it?

21:42.480 --> 21:45.000
Well, the first thing we can
do is actually live our values.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.790
We say we believe in
integration and equality,

21:47.790 --> 21:50.520
that means that we're going
to have to give something up.

21:50.520 --> 21:54.730
You can't say you want
equality for all children,

21:54.730 --> 21:56.790
but then try to get
advantage for your own.

21:56.790 --> 21:59.110
Those two things actually
don't work together.

21:59.110 --> 22:02.580
So I think as a country we have
a lot of soul searching to do.

22:02.580 --> 22:04.680
Do we really believe
that every child should

22:04.680 --> 22:05.730
have the same opportunity?

22:05.730 --> 22:07.710
Because if that's
true, we can't hoard

22:07.710 --> 22:09.990
all of the opportunity
for our children,

22:09.990 --> 22:12.000
and the same types
of children who

22:12.000 --> 22:13.920
have always had the advantage.

22:13.920 --> 22:15.550
Well, thank you so much
for being here, Nicole.

22:15.550 --> 22:16.580
Thanks so much for having me.

22:21.180 --> 22:23.770
So it's got all new floors.

22:23.770 --> 22:26.350
And I remodeled the
kitchen based on an episode

22:26.350 --> 22:28.400
of Property Brothers.

22:28.400 --> 22:30.190
Anyways, knock yourselves out.

22:30.190 --> 22:34.970
All new cabinets, and
sinks, and whatever.

22:34.970 --> 22:37.180
Course these schools
are all racist,

22:37.180 --> 22:39.880
and your lawn is a rip off,
and you'll probably kill

22:39.880 --> 22:42.770
one of your kids with your car.

22:42.770 --> 22:44.740
Ron, those are
all real problems

22:44.740 --> 22:47.110
but you don't have
to leave the suburbs.

22:47.110 --> 22:48.520
There's a better way.

22:48.520 --> 22:49.740
Haven't you done
enough already

22:49.740 --> 22:51.400
you overgrown garden gnome?

22:51.400 --> 22:54.130
I am done listening to you.

22:54.130 --> 22:56.980
Well, maybe you listen to
Ellen Dunham-Jones Director

22:56.980 --> 22:58.540
of the Urban Design
program at Georgia

22:58.540 --> 23:01.780
Tech and a leading authority
on suburban redevelopment.

23:01.780 --> 23:05.320
Ron, the good news is now that
we're aware of these problems,

23:05.320 --> 23:07.540
communities across the
country are implementing

23:07.540 --> 23:10.240
real solutions to fix them.

23:10.240 --> 23:14.770
Like in Atlanta, where a 22 mile
park and transit loop around

23:14.770 --> 23:18.650
the city is connecting its
suburban neighborhoods.

23:18.650 --> 23:23.080
Or Pleasant Ridge, Ohio which
revitalized an old Main Street

23:23.080 --> 23:26.800
with new local businesses by
designating it a community

23:26.800 --> 23:28.240
entertainment district.

23:28.240 --> 23:29.530
And you can help
encourage this

23:29.530 --> 23:32.080
by demanding that your
neighborhood has protected

23:32.080 --> 23:35.080
routes so every child
can get to school safely

23:35.080 --> 23:36.520
and independently.

23:36.520 --> 23:38.350
And you can lobby your
state government to make

23:38.350 --> 23:39.730
school funding more equitable.

23:39.730 --> 23:41.500
And you can support
the integration

23:41.500 --> 23:43.990
of students of color
into your local schools.

23:43.990 --> 23:47.080
The fact is, Ron, you don't
have to leave for the suburbs.

23:47.080 --> 23:50.020
Instead, you can help
to make them better.

23:50.020 --> 23:51.470
I don't want to move, Dad.

23:51.470 --> 23:56.090
All my friends are here,
like Lorraine Hamilton.

23:56.090 --> 23:57.500
You're right.

23:57.500 --> 24:01.790
This is my community and
I'm not giving up on it.

24:01.790 --> 24:04.940
All right you lookie-loos,
get out of here, huh.

24:04.940 --> 24:07.210
We are staying.

24:07.210 --> 24:08.450
Come here little Donovan.

24:08.450 --> 24:12.230
Listen up, now this place,
it's got a lot of problems.

24:12.230 --> 24:15.710
But we're going to work
on fixing them together.

24:15.710 --> 24:16.480
OK.

24:16.480 --> 24:20.310
But right now buddy, there's
only one thing I want to do.

24:20.310 --> 24:24.850
Little Donovan, do you
want to have a catch?

24:24.850 --> 24:25.550
Yeah!

24:34.140 --> 24:36.980
Maybe I should move.
