08:44.222 --> 08:46.188

08:46.224 --> 08:48.248
I have employees who can vouch for it.

08:48.285 --> 08:49.049
What do you do?

08:49.068 --> 08:50.793
Run an online clothing company.

08:50.829 --> 08:52.661
Built it from scratch.
Worked my ass off.

08:52.697 --> 08:55.698
You want to know what
Ash would say about work?

08:55.734 --> 08:57.199
"The world will provide."

But you know who did?

08:58.703 --> 08:59.693
Me.

08:59.725 --> 09:02.258
Someone had to be responsible.

09:02.294 --> 09:04.694
The band, they thought I was uncool,

09:04.730 --> 09:09.232
but it was Ash, he was
the selfish, childish one.

09:09.268 --> 09:11.267
I completely understand.

09:11.303 --> 09:13.369
I was with an immature partner,

09:13.405 --> 09:14.537
and it was maddening.

09:14.573 --> 09:15.838
It's crazy-making.

09:15.874 --> 09:16.908
Yeah, wanted to kill him.

09:18.043 --> 09:19.577
I didn't say that.

09:20.946 --> 09:22.445
LUCIFER: Ouch. Shade.

09:22.481 --> 09:24.673
I wouldn't take it too personally.

09:26.051 --> 09:27.550
Yeah, right.

09:27.586 --> 09:29.354
I'm sure it's not me
she's talking about.

09:30.522 --> 09:32.689
Well, who else would
she be talking about?

09:32.725 --> 09:34.290
CHLOE: So, you want to explain

09:34.326 --> 09:35.992
the domestic abuse charge?

09:36.028 --> 09:37.927
Look, we fought.

09:37.963 --> 09:39.829
I'm not proud of that.

09:39.865 --> 09:42.398
But I've paid for my
mistakes, literally.

09:42.434 --> 09:43.533
What do you mean?

09:43.569 --> 09:45.702
Ash took everything when we divorced.

09:45.738 --> 09:48.338
I agreed to sit down
with a divorce mediator,

09:48.374 --> 09:50.740
and the guy was completely
biased against me.

09:50.776 --> 09:52.342
I think him and Ash

09:52.378 --> 09:54.977
set up some sort of shady side deal.

09:55.013 --> 09:56.412
He's the real criminal.

09:56.452 --> 09:59.048
But if Ash got this
hefty divorce settlement,

09:59.084 --> 10:01.050
then why was he couch-surfing?

10:01.086 --> 10:02.018
Where'd the money go?

10:02.054 --> 10:04.863
Maybe the mediator took it?

10:04.916 --> 10:06.783
Like I said, the guy's a crook.

10:13.932 --> 10:15.631
I got him.

10:15.667 --> 10:17.400
Someone tagged Lucifer at The Grove.

10:17.436 --> 10:18.501
You're kidding.

10:18.537 --> 10:21.204
Someone named "Cottoncandy86"?

10:21.240 --> 10:22.638
That's an unfortunate name.

10:22.674 --> 10:25.074
No, Mom, it's an Internet... never mind.

10:25.110 --> 10:29.245
It looks like they were getting
frozen yogurt to celebrate...

10:29.281 --> 10:30.546
newlywed life?

10:30.582 --> 10:33.416
#mrslucifer, #hottiehubby?

10:33.452 --> 10:35.051
Are you speaking in tongues?

10:35.087 --> 10:36.052
Mom!

10:36.088 --> 10:37.353
Look.

10:37.389 --> 10:40.056
He and cottoncandy86 are married.

10:40.092 --> 10:41.277
- What?!
- He specifically

10:41.280 --> 10:42.894
told me to watch over Chloe.

10:42.928 --> 10:44.461
After everything that
we did to save her,

10:44.463 --> 10:46.688
I don't... I don't understand.

10:46.691 --> 10:48.831
Betrothing himself to that?

10:48.867 --> 10:50.666
He wouldn't.

10:50.702 --> 10:53.403
Perhaps Mazikeen was right.

10:53.439 --> 10:55.506
Lucifer's concocting a plan.

10:57.242 --> 10:59.477
♪

11:01.747 --> 11:04.313
Well, Courtney's story checked out.

11:04.349 --> 11:06.282
She was working late with two employees

11:06.318 --> 11:07.410
at the time Ash was killed.

11:07.442 --> 11:08.919
Courtney's been pointing pretty hard

11:08.921 --> 11:11.020
at their divorce
mediator, but I don't know.

11:11.056 --> 11:12.288
Seems like a stretch.

11:12.324 --> 11:14.390
Yeah, agreed, but I did
check it out anyways.

11:14.426 --> 11:15.559
This guy named Anthony Annan.

11:15.561 --> 11:16.793
He's got a clean record, and nothing

11:16.795 --> 11:18.461
but Courtney's word points to him.

11:18.497 --> 11:20.509
Uh, Detective, a word?

11:20.556 --> 11:21.798
You're still here? Shouldn't you be

11:21.800 --> 11:23.566
on some honeymoon far, far away?

11:23.602 --> 11:25.635
Oh, look, it's Mannequin Hair.

11:25.671 --> 11:27.970
- Who?
- I don't know his name,

11:28.006 --> 11:29.705
but he's in the other photo, too.

11:29.741 --> 11:32.141
- Is that weird?
- What other photo?

11:32.177 --> 11:33.209
The one of the dead dude.

11:33.245 --> 11:35.233
See? Right there.

11:35.272 --> 11:36.613
Mannequin Hair is in the crowd

11:36.615 --> 11:38.614
behind the yellow tape.

11:38.650 --> 11:39.816
She's right, it's him.

11:39.852 --> 11:41.217
Unbelievable.

11:41.253 --> 11:43.186
It's highly unlikely for
Ash's divorce mediator

11:43.222 --> 11:45.077
to be lurking at the
scene of his murder, yes?

11:45.124 --> 11:45.855
Yeah, very.

11:45.891 --> 11:47.449
I'll track him down. Nice.

11:47.504 --> 11:49.125
Well done, Candy.

11:49.161 --> 11:51.176
Well, I don't get a
lot of names at my job,

11:51.223 --> 11:53.229
so I'm super good with faces.

11:53.265 --> 11:55.164
- And other things.
- Ah.

11:55.200 --> 11:57.253
LUCIFER: This is fun,
isn't it? Isn't this fun?

11:57.285 --> 11:59.802
Hmm? Murder, suspects, clues.

11:59.838 --> 12:01.471
Gosh, it feels good to be back.

12:01.507 --> 12:03.710
Right, I'm going to call Candy a cab,

12:03.749 --> 12:06.479
and then you and I can get
down to brass tacks, yes?

12:06.520 --> 12:08.286
Actually, come to think of it,

12:08.306 --> 12:09.405
who watches over Trixie?

12:09.443 --> 12:10.575
Do you want to go splitsies on a nanny?

12:10.577 --> 12:12.276
Besides, I hear this
case involves a band,

12:12.308 --> 12:13.144
so, lucky for you

12:13.180 --> 12:16.080
I bring my much-needed
musical expertise.

12:16.116 --> 12:17.581
Did you know he plays piano?

12:17.617 --> 12:19.583
Like, better than Elton Tom.

12:19.619 --> 12:21.275
I know plenty about music, thank you.

12:21.307 --> 12:23.242
(laughs) Do you, now, Detective?

12:23.255 --> 12:24.725
Right, what's your favorite band, then?

12:24.727 --> 12:26.999
- Hmm?
- Hey...

12:27.035 --> 12:29.434
(laughs): Oh, full of '90s jams, I see.

12:29.470 --> 12:31.637
The Bangles, N'Sync,

12:31.673 --> 12:33.272
Right Said Fred?

12:33.308 --> 12:35.141
- Give me the phone back.
- I mean, seriously, Detective,

12:35.143 --> 12:36.409
your music queue alone is enough

12:36.411 --> 12:38.076
to disqualify you from this case.

12:38.112 --> 12:40.612
You're not the one who's
<i>on</i> this case, Lucifer.

12:40.648 --> 12:43.749
What? But what about our partnership?

12:43.785 --> 12:46.652
Our partnership ended
when you ghosted me

12:46.688 --> 12:48.186
and the entire department.

12:48.222 --> 12:50.555
You can't just march back
in here like nothing's wrong.

12:50.591 --> 12:53.160
You can't just grab what
you want when you want.

12:55.706 --> 12:58.098
I'll just put that down there, then.

13:03.695 --> 13:05.795
You let me down, Lucifer.

13:07.275 --> 13:09.541
I mean, what good is a partner

13:09.577 --> 13:11.044
if I can't depend on you?

13:12.180 --> 13:14.846
I don't need you anymore.

13:14.882 --> 13:17.683
Well, surely you don't mean that. I do.

13:17.719 --> 13:19.318
You can go.

13:19.354 --> 13:20.921
Both of you.

13:24.332 --> 13:25.359
Right.

13:27.324 --> 13:31.142
I haven't seen you in a while, Lucifer.

13:31.178 --> 13:33.680
Uh, I know you've been through Hell.

13:34.882 --> 13:37.248
I suppose we can discuss
that another time.

13:37.284 --> 13:40.318
Oh, no, no, there's no
need for censoring, Doctor.

13:40.354 --> 13:42.720
Candy and I have no secrets.

13:42.756 --> 13:44.958
Isn't that the key to
a successful marriage?

13:46.427 --> 13:50.194
And how are you coping
since your... travels?

13:50.230 --> 13:53.164
Any warning signs of lasting trauma?

13:53.200 --> 13:54.299
Denial?

13:54.335 --> 13:57.168
Rash decisions?

13:57.204 --> 13:58.891
Um... no, no.

13:58.922 --> 14:01.539
I think I've thought through
everything quite carefully.

14:01.575 --> 14:03.975
He's a thinker, this one!

14:04.011 --> 14:06.945
And, uh... and what
about Detective Decker?

14:06.981 --> 14:09.080
I thought you two had become...

14:09.116 --> 14:11.616
close.

14:11.652 --> 14:13.785
Well, everything I felt for her

14:13.821 --> 14:16.955
was smoke and mirrors,
courtesy of dear old Dad.

14:16.991 --> 14:19.057
I mean, He clearly expected me to zig,

14:19.093 --> 14:20.558
and so I zagged.

14:20.594 --> 14:24.762
And does Chloe know that
you've <i>zagged</i> Candy?

14:24.798 --> 14:26.130
- (giggles)
- Yes.

14:26.166 --> 14:27.231
She just fired me.

14:27.267 --> 14:28.399
- Shocking.
- I know.

14:28.430 --> 14:32.370
But if you felt so manipulated...

14:32.406 --> 14:34.505
why return to Chloe at all?

14:34.541 --> 14:36.608
Well, I mean, I tried to leave,

14:36.644 --> 14:41.179
but I just felt that I missed...

14:41.215 --> 14:42.513
my work.

14:42.549 --> 14:45.083
Look, anyway, baby, bathwater,

14:45.119 --> 14:47.152
the detective and I are
quite the crime-fighting duo.

14:47.154 --> 14:48.486
I mean, you wouldn't break up

14:48.522 --> 14:50.154
- Batman and Robin, now, would you?
- No.

14:50.190 --> 14:51.789
We have a job to do.

14:51.825 --> 14:54.024
So if she could just see sense...

14:54.074 --> 14:55.727
I was fired once.

14:55.763 --> 14:57.228
But you know what I did?

14:57.264 --> 14:59.864
I just kept showing up
and made myself expandable.

14:59.900 --> 15:01.933
Oh, uh, do you mean indispensable?

15:01.969 --> 15:04.802
No. Expandable. I got a boob job,

15:04.839 --> 15:06.972
and it totally expanded my horizons.

15:07.007 --> 15:08.706
Because then, I could do something

15:08.742 --> 15:10.375
none of the other girls could do.

15:10.411 --> 15:11.376
You wanna see?

15:11.412 --> 15:12.910
- Ooh, yes.
- No.

15:12.946 --> 15:14.746
No?

15:14.782 --> 15:16.714
But you know, the part
about showing up...

15:16.750 --> 15:20.318
that's not, actually, bad advice.

15:20.354 --> 15:21.486
It's called "acting as if."

15:21.522 --> 15:25.289
Yes. Yes, well done, Candy.

15:25.325 --> 15:27.676
I think I know exactly how
to get back on the case.

15:27.723 --> 15:29.795
Oh, gosh, I wish I'd
talked to you earlier.

15:29.797 --> 15:30.809
Saved myself a trip.

15:30.845 --> 15:32.310
(both chuckling)

15:32.330 --> 15:33.598
LUCIFER: Have a candy, Candy.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.635
(squeals, chuckles)

15:37.371 --> 15:39.070
DAN: <i>Bad news, Chloe.</i>

15:39.106 --> 15:41.472
Ash's mediator won't talk.

15:41.508 --> 15:43.776
Well, because he's a lawyer.

15:44.861 --> 15:47.295
Yep, not without a warrant.

15:47.298 --> 15:49.747
Okay, will do.

15:49.783 --> 15:51.315
I know you're there.

15:51.351 --> 15:52.884
I'm a cop, Lucifer.

15:52.920 --> 15:55.586
You think I don't know
when I'm being followed?

15:55.622 --> 15:57.955
(sighs) All right, fair enough.

15:57.991 --> 16:00.391
Look, I'm simply here
to help with the case.

16:00.427 --> 16:03.094
What, you mean the case
that Chloe kicked you off of?

16:03.130 --> 16:05.697
I'm just... I'm trying
to put things back

16:05.733 --> 16:07.233
the way they were, Dan.

16:09.403 --> 16:12.236
Yeah, I've been there.

16:12.272 --> 16:17.041
Right. And I have a brilliant idea.

16:17.077 --> 16:18.843
You expect me to let you go undercover

16:18.879 --> 16:20.178
with your stripper wife?

16:20.214 --> 16:21.747
Right. First of all,
she's an exotic dancer.

16:21.749 --> 16:22.880
"Stripper" is pejorative.

16:22.916 --> 16:25.383
Well, far be it from me
to disrespect your bride.

16:25.419 --> 16:26.718
Thank you. And secondly,

16:26.754 --> 16:28.820
Candy is a natural at
getting men to talk.

16:28.856 --> 16:31.355
CHLOE: Oh, I bet she is.

16:31.391 --> 16:32.757
Awesome.

16:32.793 --> 16:35.326
Lucifer has outdone himself.

16:35.362 --> 16:38.329
Thanks.

16:38.365 --> 16:39.931
Mm-hmm.

16:39.967 --> 16:42.366
LUCIFER: But, Detective, the mediator

16:42.393 --> 16:44.090
won't talk to you without a warrant.

16:44.102 --> 16:46.462
Which is why I so wisely made
an appointment for Candy and I

16:46.473 --> 16:48.339
this afternoon, see?

16:48.375 --> 16:49.407
You need me.

16:49.443 --> 16:51.175
Let me think about that. No.

16:51.211 --> 16:53.044
Uh, Detective, if I didn't know better,

16:53.080 --> 16:55.713
I'd say you were prejudiced
against exotic dancers.

16:55.749 --> 16:57.415
Okay, we're done here.

16:57.451 --> 16:58.549
- Good-bye.
- But...

16:58.585 --> 16:59.884
Come on, Candy.

16:59.920 --> 17:01.719
Well, look, if you change your mind

17:01.755 --> 17:03.688
and wish to take me up
on this splendid lead,

17:03.724 --> 17:05.423
then, you know, you can always text me,

17:05.459 --> 17:07.381
or I'm on Wobble now as well.

17:07.412 --> 17:10.262
You can get Candy on Cottoncandy86.

17:14.367 --> 17:18.903
♪ Take a good look at
the world around you ♪

17:18.939 --> 17:23.107
♪ All the filth and hate
does it astound you? ♪

17:23.143 --> 17:26.377
It was a marvelous idea.
I'm sure she'll come around.

17:26.413 --> 17:27.545
MOM: So it's true.

17:27.580 --> 17:29.447
You're back.

17:29.483 --> 17:32.850
Oh, invading my
privacy, as usual, I see.

17:32.894 --> 17:35.361
Your brother and I were worried sick.

17:35.389 --> 17:38.289
You could have at least called.

17:38.325 --> 17:41.325
Oh, my gosh, are you Lucifer's sister?

17:41.361 --> 17:42.393
Oh!

17:42.429 --> 17:44.061
Oh, Lucifer, don't be rude.

17:44.097 --> 17:46.497
Who is your top-heavy friend?

17:46.533 --> 17:50.535
Candy, darling, this is my mother.

17:50.571 --> 17:53.838
Mum, this is Candy, my wife.

17:53.874 --> 17:56.007
I'm sorry that we didn't
invite you to the wedding.

17:56.043 --> 17:57.041
We just decided

17:57.077 --> 17:59.579
no enemies.

18:01.648 --> 18:04.382
Well, lovely to meet you.

18:04.418 --> 18:06.617
You're Lucifer's <i>mom?</i>

18:06.653 --> 18:10.603
Oh, my gosh, you look amazing!

18:10.658 --> 18:12.523
I should start using sunscreen.

18:12.559 --> 18:14.025
A shame he kept you hidden.

18:14.061 --> 18:16.128
I hate secrets.

18:19.433 --> 18:20.998
Do you like shopping?

18:21.034 --> 18:22.133
<i>Do</i> I?

18:22.169 --> 18:26.804
I want to hear all
about you and Lucifer.

18:26.840 --> 18:30.608
You two must have so many plans.

18:30.644 --> 18:32.476
So...

18:32.512 --> 18:36.816
what do we think of Candy?

18:38.952 --> 18:42.755
Well, I think she's perfect for Lucifer.

18:43.924 --> 18:46.290
Her bra size equals her IQ, huh?

18:46.326 --> 18:47.927
That's generous.

18:52.833 --> 18:55.199
See that vein popping
out the side of your neck?

18:55.235 --> 18:58.669
Same thing happens when I
throw the dishes in the trash

18:58.705 --> 19:02.039
instead of washing them.

19:02.075 --> 19:03.541
You're mad.

19:03.577 --> 19:06.677
I'm an idiot.

19:06.713 --> 19:10.648
Look, I know Lucifer
better than anyone, okay,

19:10.684 --> 19:12.449
and he does this sometimes.

19:12.488 --> 19:15.653
Disappears, does
stupid, impulsive things.

19:15.689 --> 19:19.123
But he always comes back around, Chloe.

19:19.159 --> 19:21.993
Yeah, but this time I don't want him to.

19:22.029 --> 19:25.730
I'm serious, I am done. I'm done.

19:25.766 --> 19:28.299
But he did get you an
in with that mediator.

19:28.335 --> 19:30.735
That's a good thing, right?

19:30.771 --> 19:31.869
Yeah, well, I don't care.

19:31.905 --> 19:33.105
There's no way I'm letting him

19:33.140 --> 19:36.309
and his exotic-dancer wife
on my case, or any case.

19:38.712 --> 19:40.945
Maybe you and Lucifer need a mediator.

19:40.981 --> 19:44.382
(sighs)

19:44.431 --> 19:46.632
Just saying.

19:56.096 --> 19:58.963
ANTHONY: So, Mrs. Morningstar...

19:58.999 --> 20:02.268
Oh, no, no, no, no,
you can call me Candy.

20:07.034 --> 20:08.303
Candy.

20:08.358 --> 20:10.476
Why do you want to divorce Lucifer?

20:10.479 --> 20:12.292
Um...

20:12.328 --> 20:15.829
Well, I just feel like we're
supposed to have a partnership,

20:15.865 --> 20:19.806
and it just totally feels
like it's not working anymore.

20:19.837 --> 20:22.169
Mm-hmm. And you two
have been married for...

20:22.205 --> 20:24.538
- Five days.
- Ever!

20:24.574 --> 20:26.006
- Forever.
- Five days.

20:26.042 --> 20:27.618
- LUCIFER: Five days.
- It feels like it.

20:27.620 --> 20:29.009
But we've been through
a lot in that time,

20:29.011 --> 20:30.578
and I say that we work
brilliantly together,

20:30.580 --> 20:31.511
don't we, sweetie?

20:31.547 --> 20:33.113
(laughs) Well...

20:33.149 --> 20:35.515
if you're talking
about the bedroom, yeah.

20:35.551 --> 20:36.837
I mean, thank God

20:36.840 --> 20:38.819
this bod is made for pure sex,

20:38.855 --> 20:40.120
because, clearly,

20:40.156 --> 20:41.721
(whispering): it's all he cares about.

20:41.757 --> 20:44.157
I'm tired.

20:44.193 --> 20:45.458
Eh...

20:45.494 --> 20:48.300
Would you say that's the,
uh, the crux of your issue?

20:48.303 --> 20:49.784
Oh, the crux of the issue?

20:49.787 --> 20:51.265
Oh, no, no, no, that would he Lucifer

20:51.267 --> 20:53.366
disappearing, and then popping back up

20:53.402 --> 20:56.403
with zero explanation and
a ditzy bimbo on his arm.

20:56.455 --> 21:00.223
He's cheated on you in
five days of marriage?

21:00.243 --> 21:02.309
No, of course I didn't. I've
been completely faithful.

21:02.311 --> 21:04.544
I take the vows of
marriage very seriously.

21:04.580 --> 21:07.581
And that's why you chose an
idiotic, bedazzled <i>tweener</i>

21:07.584 --> 21:08.891
as your partner.

21:08.927 --> 21:09.593
ANTHONY: I'm sorry, Candy,

21:09.595 --> 21:11.161
there's no name calling in here.

21:11.163 --> 21:13.698
Even if it's to yourself.

21:14.800 --> 21:15.965
Lucifer,

21:16.001 --> 21:17.600
would you like to respond?

21:17.636 --> 21:19.135
(scoffs)

21:19.171 --> 21:22.338
This is gonna be hard for
you to understand, but...

21:22.374 --> 21:24.605
I've been through Hell recently.

21:24.637 --> 21:27.076
Both figuratively and literally.

21:27.112 --> 21:29.178
True torment, my
greatest fears realized.

21:29.214 --> 21:31.781
Lucifer, I am the one who almost died.

21:31.817 --> 21:35.586
Yes, I know. That is
what I'm talking about.

21:36.588 --> 21:38.021
(sighs) Wow.

21:38.057 --> 21:42.091
I almost believe you care.

21:42.127 --> 21:44.395
Have you ever known me to lie?

21:47.900 --> 21:50.134
I don't know.

21:51.970 --> 21:54.270
I don't know.

21:54.306 --> 21:56.474
Why don't we take five?

22:03.715 --> 22:05.882
(Anthony clears throat)

22:05.918 --> 22:07.985
Are you okay, Mrs. Morningstar?

22:10.055 --> 22:11.687
(sighs)

22:11.723 --> 22:15.546
Yeah, I'm... yeah, thank you. I am.

22:15.569 --> 22:17.032
- (chuckles)
- Um...

22:18.597 --> 22:23.466
I, uh, I had heard
through a friend that...

22:23.502 --> 22:29.372
you were open to a
little extra negotiation.

22:29.408 --> 22:33.042
Um, I'm not sure what you mean by that.

22:33.078 --> 22:36.112
Um, well, my husband, you see,

22:36.148 --> 22:37.914
has a lot of money.

22:37.950 --> 22:40.116
And so, if you were to...

22:40.152 --> 22:42.919
swing things my way,

22:42.955 --> 22:46.289
then I'd make it worth your while.

22:46.325 --> 22:47.959
Wow...

22:49.628 --> 22:50.927
(chuckles)

22:50.963 --> 22:53.229
You're really something.

22:53.265 --> 22:55.731
But that would be crossing a line.

22:55.767 --> 22:57.592
And I can't do things like that.

22:57.595 --> 22:58.694
LUCIFER: Why not?

22:58.734 --> 23:00.436
You did with Ash Corrigan.

23:00.472 --> 23:02.105
You two are in on this together?

23:02.141 --> 23:04.408
- No, we're...
- Oh, yes.

23:05.477 --> 23:06.709
(Chloe sighs)

23:06.745 --> 23:08.079
LAPD.

23:09.581 --> 23:12.648
We know about your side
deal with Ash Corrigan.

23:12.684 --> 23:15.059
Didn't pilfer enough
money from Ash's ex?

23:15.121 --> 23:17.286
Had to go and kill Ash to
get the rest of the spoils?

23:17.322 --> 23:20.556
Whoa. I would never, ever hurt Ash.

23:20.592 --> 23:22.859
Then what did you want
to accomplish, Anthony?

23:22.895 --> 23:24.861
Hmm? Come on.

23:24.897 --> 23:26.262
Tell me.

23:26.265 --> 23:28.267
What did you desire?

23:30.035 --> 23:31.501
I wanted...

23:31.537 --> 23:34.270
Yes?

23:34.306 --> 23:37.940
I wanted the Heavy Woolies
to be the hugest band ever.

23:37.976 --> 23:40.676
But... oh. (chuckles)

23:40.712 --> 23:42.578
ANTHONY: Um...

23:42.614 --> 23:44.787
Okay, yeah, yes, I
helped Ash in the divorce

23:44.790 --> 23:46.363
and I got him all of Courtney's money.

23:46.366 --> 23:48.634
But there was no side deal,
'cause I did it for free.

23:49.579 --> 23:51.745
I did it for the band.

23:51.790 --> 23:53.156
I did it for the music.

23:53.192 --> 23:54.223
So,

23:54.259 --> 23:55.124
you're a fan?

23:55.160 --> 23:57.660
No, no, no. I was the manager.

23:57.696 --> 24:00.363
At least, Ash promised me...

24:00.399 --> 24:02.643
maybe I could be the manager someday.

24:02.684 --> 24:04.683
The point is, I helped them a lot.

24:04.702 --> 24:07.538
Ash and I came up with a plan.

24:08.540 --> 24:10.873
(Lucifer laughs) Buy
all the albums himself

24:10.909 --> 24:13.176
using his ex-wife's
money to inflate sales.

24:13.212 --> 24:15.144
Talk about self-promotion.

24:15.180 --> 24:17.073
All they needed was a little nudge.

24:17.124 --> 24:18.689
And it worked.

24:18.732 --> 24:20.265
I mean, we got on the charts

24:20.315 --> 24:22.221
and we started getting radio play,

24:22.224 --> 24:24.020
we were gonna be booked
for this big tour.

24:24.022 --> 24:26.255
I mean, we were gonna make it so big.

24:26.291 --> 24:29.158
We have a photo linking
you to the crime scene.

24:29.194 --> 24:30.326
Why were you there?

24:30.362 --> 24:31.761
I was looking for them after the gig,

24:31.763 --> 24:33.896
'cause Ash and Marla,
they were fighting.

24:33.932 --> 24:35.838
The bassist? Why were they fighting?

24:35.841 --> 24:36.987
When weren't they fighting?

24:36.990 --> 24:39.323
I thought that Ash was gonna
kick Marla out of the band

24:39.326 --> 24:41.464
that night after the
gig, so I went down there

24:41.467 --> 24:42.834
to see how it went down.

24:44.509 --> 24:46.642
That's when I saw the
police standing there,

24:46.678 --> 24:48.811
across the street.

24:48.847 --> 24:50.709
Over his dead body.

24:52.503 --> 24:55.238
It was the night the music died.

24:57.041 --> 24:58.508
(Lucifer scoffs)

24:59.944 --> 25:02.546
Perhaps Marla didn't want
to be the fifth Beatle.

25:03.883 --> 25:05.816
Looks like we have a new suspect.

25:05.819 --> 25:08.250
Oh, well, if that's the case,
then you're welcome, Detective.

25:08.252 --> 25:09.751
It's nice to be needed.

25:09.787 --> 25:11.019
Look, go home.

25:11.055 --> 25:12.654
Trust me.

25:12.690 --> 25:14.424
Candy needs you more than I do.

25:17.828 --> 25:19.794
(sighs)

25:19.830 --> 25:21.231
(chuckles awkwardly)

25:23.301 --> 25:24.699
Mine's bigger, right?

25:24.735 --> 25:28.003
Yes. Does that mean anything?

25:28.039 --> 25:30.071
Just how much Lucifer loves me.

25:30.107 --> 25:33.174
Ah, so these small ones are for
couples who don't really care.

25:33.210 --> 25:34.276
Exactly.

25:34.312 --> 25:35.577
Tell me more

25:35.613 --> 25:36.778
about you and Lucifer.

25:36.814 --> 25:39.382
What comes next for you two lovebirds?

25:40.251 --> 25:41.550
Did he say anything

25:41.586 --> 25:44.853
about... oh, I don't know... matricide?

25:44.889 --> 25:47.989
No, I think the mattress in
the penthouse is pretty new.

25:48.025 --> 25:49.758
Oh, come on, Candy.

25:49.794 --> 25:52.896
I know you two have some kind of plan.

25:54.365 --> 25:56.865
Well, you're right about that.

25:56.901 --> 25:58.333
So many plans.

25:58.369 --> 26:00.804
Tell me everything.

26:03.407 --> 26:06.408
Someday...

26:06.444 --> 26:08.109
I want to open my own juice bar.

26:08.145 --> 26:09.311
Or a tanning salon.

26:09.347 --> 26:11.046
Or a combo juice bar

26:11.082 --> 26:12.380
and tanning salon. (gasps)

26:12.416 --> 26:13.615
You're speaking

26:13.651 --> 26:16.384
and yet I don't
understand a single word.

26:16.420 --> 26:18.620
I get that a lot.

26:18.656 --> 26:20.355
Why don't you talk and I'll listen?

26:20.391 --> 26:21.398
I'm a good listener.

26:21.401 --> 26:22.591
Like right now? I know exactly

26:22.593 --> 26:23.792
what you're trying to say.

26:23.828 --> 26:25.460
- But I didn't...
- You want what's best

26:25.496 --> 26:26.995
for your son and you'll do anything

26:27.031 --> 26:28.096
to make sure he's happy.

26:28.132 --> 26:31.766
I want you to know,
I got Lucifer's back.

26:31.802 --> 26:32.934
And yours.

26:32.970 --> 26:34.169
Because...

26:34.205 --> 26:36.539
you're <i>my</i> mom now, too.

26:37.541 --> 26:40.176
We're family. (laughs)

26:41.078 --> 26:42.377
(giggles)

26:42.413 --> 26:43.912
MOM: <i>She's a sinister</i>

26:43.948 --> 26:44.946
genius.

26:44.982 --> 26:46.738
Mother, come on now.

26:46.741 --> 26:49.818
Here I thought this "Candy"
was an insipid dullard.

26:49.854 --> 26:52.821
But she may be the
most formidable opponent

26:52.857 --> 26:54.557
I've ever faced.

26:55.393 --> 26:57.121
I came away with nothing!

26:57.176 --> 26:59.127
Not a single crumb of information

26:59.163 --> 27:00.629
about Lucifer's real agenda.

27:00.665 --> 27:02.831
What if there is no
hidden agenda, Mom? Oh...

27:02.867 --> 27:04.499
What if this Candy's

27:04.535 --> 27:06.101
exactly who she seems?

27:06.137 --> 27:07.902
Then... (scoffs)

27:07.938 --> 27:10.171
I don't understand what Lucifer's doing.

27:10.207 --> 27:12.540
- Whatever he wants, as usual.
- So he really just married

27:12.576 --> 27:15.276
this preening mouth breather
because he likes her?

27:15.312 --> 27:16.778
Please.

27:16.814 --> 27:20.550
Only a deeply damaged soul
would make such a poor choice.

27:21.686 --> 27:22.952
(sighs)

27:24.055 --> 27:26.388
Unless...

27:26.424 --> 27:28.925
he really is that far gone.

27:30.428 --> 27:32.127
Then that would mean that my son

27:32.163 --> 27:34.763
is really, truly broken.

27:34.799 --> 27:36.698
And I'm the one that broke him.

27:36.734 --> 27:37.799
Mom...

27:37.835 --> 27:39.000
don't.

27:39.036 --> 27:40.335
I manipulated him.

27:40.371 --> 27:43.306
I pushed him too hard.

27:45.209 --> 27:46.776
I did this.

27:49.447 --> 27:52.215
I'm a terrible mother.

27:57.161 --> 27:59.394
DAN: Public intoxication, vandalism.

27:59.397 --> 28:01.322
Okay, Marla does have a few priors.

28:01.358 --> 28:03.793
But all par for the course
for a wannabe rock star.

28:04.695 --> 28:06.796
How'd you get the lead?

28:06.924 --> 28:09.024
I got in to see the mediator.

28:09.333 --> 28:10.998
Lucifer did a thing.

28:11.001 --> 28:13.702
Yes, I knew you guys
would patch things up.

28:13.738 --> 28:14.969
Nope.

28:15.005 --> 28:16.078
Not even close.

28:16.081 --> 28:17.305
(whispering): Not even close.

28:17.308 --> 28:19.236
Well, it sounds like
he's trying to help.

28:19.272 --> 28:20.504
Why are you rooting for him?

28:20.540 --> 28:21.605
I'm not rooting for him.

28:21.641 --> 28:22.555
Okay, anyhow,

28:22.558 --> 28:25.142
to me, Marla reads like a
troublemaker, not a killer.

28:25.178 --> 28:28.979
Oh, unless you count
crimes against fashion.

28:29.015 --> 28:30.213
Yikes.

28:30.216 --> 28:32.582
Hey, guys.

28:32.618 --> 28:35.820
Remember those marks on Ash's head?

28:37.561 --> 28:39.790
You think they came from
the knobs on Marla's bass?

28:39.792 --> 28:41.758
I mean, I still have
to do further tests,

28:41.794 --> 28:43.693
but it sure looks like <i>Tetris</i> to me.

28:43.729 --> 28:45.095
Okay, maybe Marla's our girl.

28:45.131 --> 28:47.465
We got to find her and
find that instrument.

28:48.401 --> 28:51.870
(electric guitar riff playing)

28:54.607 --> 28:56.606
Yeah, I spoke to her roommate.

28:56.642 --> 28:58.775
She said Marla's here somewhere.

28:58.811 --> 28:59.576
Yeah.

28:59.612 --> 29:01.378

29:38.766 --> 29:39.964
Hello.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.834
This next song is for
a, uh, a special someone.

29:42.870 --> 29:46.771
A woman who says she
doesn't need me anymore.

29:46.807 --> 29:47.653
(crowd oohing)

29:47.681 --> 29:48.812
LUCIFER: Yeah.

29:48.839 --> 29:50.238
Well, I say she's wrong.

29:50.263 --> 29:54.078
And I'm gonna prove just
what I'm willing to do

29:54.114 --> 29:55.346
for our partnership.

29:55.382 --> 29:59.417
That's right, rock a sweet '90s jam.

30:59.713 --> 31:01.779
And her name...

31:01.815 --> 31:03.781
is Marla. Has anyone seen Marla?

31:03.817 --> 31:05.283
We're looking for someone called Marla.

31:05.285 --> 31:07.385
I know she's here tonight.

31:07.421 --> 31:08.691
She's the bass player.

31:08.694 --> 31:10.221
Ah, there she is!

31:10.257 --> 31:12.391
Marla! Will you bring
her up to the front?

31:14.394 --> 31:17.895
Come on. Marla, everybody.

31:17.931 --> 31:19.363
(laughs)

31:19.399 --> 31:20.465
(song concludes)

31:20.501 --> 31:22.922
See? You need me.

31:29.254 --> 31:31.342
That better not be Marla's bass.

31:31.378 --> 31:32.643
It's already been processed.

31:32.679 --> 31:34.876
And, I've written you a song. Ready?

31:41.559 --> 31:44.119

31:44.155 --> 31:46.955
I found traces of Ash's
blood on the tuning knobs.

31:46.991 --> 31:48.490
LUCIFER: What, so Marla's the killer?

31:48.526 --> 31:50.358
Murder solved! (laughs)

31:50.394 --> 31:51.760
And I believe that proves

31:51.796 --> 31:53.963
just how much the department needs me.

31:54.733 --> 31:55.900
Including you.

31:59.403 --> 32:02.404
Uh, we got a stalker,
which is normally bad,

32:02.440 --> 32:03.905
but makes me very happy right now

32:03.941 --> 32:05.909
'cause I was getting very uncomfortable.

32:08.646 --> 32:11.714
What on Earth does he want?

32:12.817 --> 32:14.783
You know I watched over Chloe for weeks

32:14.819 --> 32:16.217
after you disappeared, right?

32:16.253 --> 32:18.119
Angel or creeper, brother?

32:18.155 --> 32:19.354
It's a fine line.

32:19.390 --> 32:21.456
You asked me to guard her,
so I did. Like an idiot!

32:21.492 --> 32:23.825
You see, because I thought
that she meant something to you.

32:23.861 --> 32:24.759
(scoffs)

32:24.795 --> 32:26.227
We both know she's special.

32:26.263 --> 32:28.830
Oh. That she is.

32:28.866 --> 32:30.965
A whoopee cushion sent from Dad.

32:31.001 --> 32:33.328
I'm sure he's having a right
old laugh at the moment.

32:33.331 --> 32:37.172
Right. So that means it's okay
to turn your back on Chloe?

32:37.208 --> 32:39.240
Just ignore her feelings?

32:39.276 --> 32:40.942
Feelings she had no control over.

32:40.978 --> 32:42.310
Feelings that aren't real.

32:42.313 --> 32:43.411
But she doesn't know that.

32:43.414 --> 32:45.950
Which is why I had to save her from...

32:48.252 --> 32:50.487
From you.

32:53.698 --> 32:55.824
You're not ignoring Chloe,
you're protecting her

32:55.826 --> 32:57.325
because she had no choice.

32:57.361 --> 32:59.828
So I gave it back to her.

32:59.864 --> 33:02.665
By holding up a shield made of Candy.

33:05.336 --> 33:07.068
I'm sorry, Lucifer.

33:07.104 --> 33:10.305
(sighs)

33:10.341 --> 33:14.042
You should at least
explain some of this to Mom.

33:14.078 --> 33:15.777
She's upset.

33:15.813 --> 33:17.879
Good.

33:17.915 --> 33:21.149
She died and went to Hell for you, Luci.

33:21.185 --> 33:23.080
For you.

33:23.083 --> 33:24.615
She faced her greatest fears

33:24.618 --> 33:25.783
all because she loves you.

33:25.786 --> 33:28.189
- Oh, come on.
- Yes, she hurt you.

33:28.225 --> 33:31.543
But she was just doing what
she thought was best for you.

33:31.546 --> 33:33.179
And from what you just told me,

33:33.182 --> 33:35.330
I'm quite sure you can relate to that.

33:35.366 --> 33:37.734
Come on.

33:38.602 --> 33:41.971
What more does it take?

33:49.446 --> 33:51.581
(sighs)

33:52.783 --> 33:54.716
You really told Lucifer where I was?

33:54.752 --> 33:56.885
Since when do you guys talk?

33:56.921 --> 33:59.587
Since he helped me save your life.

33:59.623 --> 34:01.356
I didn't kill Ash.

34:01.392 --> 34:02.724
Innocent people don't run.

34:02.760 --> 34:05.326
Or get a dead guy's
blood on their guitars.

34:05.362 --> 34:06.522
Whoa, what?

34:06.525 --> 34:08.496
Ash's blood was all over your bass.

34:08.532 --> 34:09.851
I don't know anything about that.

34:09.867 --> 34:11.601
I-I ran because of these.

34:14.737 --> 34:17.005
What, you're making fake IDs?

34:17.041 --> 34:19.230
That's how I make rent, okay?

34:19.233 --> 34:20.576
How come you didn't tell us Ash wanted

34:20.578 --> 34:22.143
to kick you out of the band?

34:22.179 --> 34:23.378
(chuckles softly)

34:23.414 --> 34:24.478
You didn't know that?

34:24.514 --> 34:27.681
S-Sure, we... bumped heads.

34:27.717 --> 34:31.649
He... he was gonna kick me out?

34:31.652 --> 34:34.889
Look, even if I'd known,
I wouldn't have hurt him.

34:34.925 --> 34:36.024
You have proof?

34:36.060 --> 34:37.091
Um... yeah, yeah.

34:37.127 --> 34:38.826
This kid, Hunter, from Silver Lake.

34:38.862 --> 34:41.393
He's like 16, maybe less?

34:41.396 --> 34:43.965
I, uh, made him an ID that said he's 27.

34:44.001 --> 34:46.301
Anyway, he hung around me all night.

34:46.337 --> 34:47.402
Actually, check Wobble.

34:47.438 --> 34:49.284
He was live posting
stuff of us all night.

34:49.286 --> 34:52.442
His ID is HunterSTomstoned.

34:54.245 --> 34:55.510
I'm legal!

34:55.545 --> 34:57.212
(whoops)

34:57.248 --> 34:59.080
There's a bunch more.

34:59.116 --> 35:01.103
Looks like they cover the time of death.

35:01.106 --> 35:02.504
Like I said, I didn't do it.

35:02.507 --> 35:04.920
Then how did Ash's blood
get all over your bass?

35:04.922 --> 35:07.490
CHLOE: Hold on, look at this.

35:08.759 --> 35:11.192
That's Doug, our drummer.

35:11.228 --> 35:12.491
He loaded our gear.

35:12.494 --> 35:14.964
Doug had the bass last.

35:16.367 --> 35:17.634
(clears throat)

35:20.437 --> 35:23.171
You know what? I should just stay here.

35:23.207 --> 35:26.741
Finish up Marla's
arrest report, but, um...

35:26.777 --> 35:30.278
maybe your consultant is free.

35:30.314 --> 35:32.547
(sighs)

35:32.583 --> 35:34.415
(knocking on door)

35:34.451 --> 35:37.285
Doug Kennedy, LAPD.

35:37.321 --> 35:40.955
Ugh. Typical youth of today,
leaving the door unlocked.

35:40.958 --> 35:42.557
(phone ringing)

35:42.593 --> 35:45.827
Uh, sorry, I...

35:45.863 --> 35:47.762
It's Candy. (sighs)

35:47.798 --> 35:48.865
Just...

35:50.234 --> 35:53.234
(whispering): Candy,
darling, I can't talk now.

35:53.270 --> 35:54.902
About to catch a killer.

35:54.938 --> 35:56.237
(grunts)

35:56.273 --> 35:57.705
(choking)

35:57.741 --> 36:00.109
Gonna have to call you back!

36:04.145 --> 36:05.544
Let him go, Doug.

36:05.580 --> 36:06.846
DOUG: You stay back!

36:06.882 --> 36:08.581
J-Just stay back!

36:08.617 --> 36:10.282
This is all Ash's fault!

36:10.318 --> 36:11.484
We were gonna make it big,

36:11.520 --> 36:13.819
and then Ash said he
was gonna going solo.

36:13.855 --> 36:15.688
He was gonna bail on all of us.

36:15.724 --> 36:17.723
I went to smack him
and I freaking lost it!

36:17.759 --> 36:19.995
You're making this worse, Doug.

36:19.998 --> 36:21.326
Let him go.

36:21.329 --> 36:23.690
No. If you care about your
partner, you drop your gun, now!

36:23.693 --> 36:26.198
Oh, Go... You may as well just
yank the sucker, then, Dougie,

36:26.234 --> 36:28.801
'cause I'm useless to her, you see?

36:28.837 --> 36:31.403
What? That's not true, Lucifer.

36:31.439 --> 36:33.939
Isn't it? I mean, you
said as much yourself.

36:33.975 --> 36:36.375
W-Wait, what the hell's going on?

36:36.411 --> 36:38.777
LUCIFER: The detective
doesn't need me anymore.

36:38.813 --> 36:40.579
So come on.

36:40.615 --> 36:41.981
Do your worst.

36:42.017 --> 36:43.516
Don't listen to him, Doug.

36:43.552 --> 36:45.784
No, go on! Go on, go on.
Yank like it's your last wank.

36:45.820 --> 36:49.154
Or better still, you
shoot, Detective. Come on.

36:49.190 --> 36:52.458
Two birds, one bullet,
what do you say? Huh?

36:52.494 --> 36:53.661
(Lucifer grunts)

36:57.766 --> 36:58.931
(coughing)

36:58.967 --> 37:00.099
You okay?

37:00.135 --> 37:01.233
I think so.

37:01.269 --> 37:03.002
DOUG: Yeah, that's because you shot me!

37:03.038 --> 37:06.447
Doug Kennedy, you're under arrest.

37:06.450 --> 37:08.984
There's not a scratch, Detective.

37:09.020 --> 37:10.619
Impressive marksmanship.

37:10.655 --> 37:13.555
Actually, I was aiming for you.

37:13.591 --> 37:15.857
(chuckles)

37:15.893 --> 37:17.594
(siren wailing)

37:21.566 --> 37:22.464
(gasps)

37:22.500 --> 37:24.733
Oh, my God! Is Lucifer okay?

37:24.769 --> 37:26.468
We were on the phone when
he got cut off, and...

37:26.470 --> 37:29.237
He's in the other room,
giving a statement.

37:29.273 --> 37:30.438
Don't worry. He's fine.

37:30.474 --> 37:31.740
Did you save him?

37:31.776 --> 37:34.442
Thank you! Oh!

37:34.478 --> 37:37.345
Oh. All... All righty. That's...

37:37.381 --> 37:40.015
His job is way too dangerous.

37:40.051 --> 37:41.716
I begged him to quit, but no.

37:41.752 --> 37:43.552
My hubby's all about his work.

37:43.588 --> 37:44.845
He is?

37:44.848 --> 37:47.856
Oh, my God, it's "Detective
this," and "Detective that."

37:47.892 --> 37:50.155
Working with you means so much to him.

37:50.158 --> 37:52.127
Well, he's got a strange
way of showing it.

37:52.163 --> 37:53.195
Well, duh.

37:53.231 --> 37:54.896
Dude's totally messed up.

37:54.932 --> 37:57.332
But then, you probably
already know that, huh?

37:57.368 --> 37:59.835
'Cause you're kind of the reason why?

37:59.871 --> 38:00.635
What? Uh...

38:00.671 --> 38:01.703
Didn't you two just go

38:01.739 --> 38:03.972
through a super bananas situation?

38:04.008 --> 38:05.740
With like, poison?

38:05.776 --> 38:07.509
He kept saying how he almost lost you,

38:07.545 --> 38:09.511
and it was hell and stuff.

38:09.547 --> 38:11.379
Yeah, i-it was bananas.

38:11.415 --> 38:15.250
It, it, I... went
through a lot, and, um...

38:15.286 --> 38:17.619
And I... I guess he did, too.

38:17.655 --> 38:19.321
LUCIFER: Great. Statement given...

38:19.357 --> 38:21.590
Candy. Oh! (grunts)

38:21.626 --> 38:22.824
Ow.

38:23.552 --> 38:25.251
Uh, Candy darling,

38:25.254 --> 38:27.629
the detective's not a big fan of PDA.

38:27.665 --> 38:29.197
It's fine.

38:29.233 --> 38:31.334
I'm just glad she's here for you.

38:32.603 --> 38:34.636
See you tomorrow at the precinct.

38:34.672 --> 38:37.340
Detective.

38:39.310 --> 38:41.910
Don't be late.

38:41.946 --> 38:43.346
(Lucifer chuckles)

38:46.949 --> 38:49.327
_

38:52.398 --> 38:53.463
(footsteps approaching)

38:53.466 --> 38:55.624
Amenadiel seems to
think I owe you a chat.

38:55.660 --> 38:59.794
So I'll start by saying
I do not forgive you.

38:59.830 --> 39:02.564
I deserve that.

39:02.600 --> 39:03.832
Hmm.

39:03.868 --> 39:07.736
However, you did make
quite a sacrifice for me.

39:07.772 --> 39:11.172
Despite your callous manipulations,

39:11.208 --> 39:14.209
maybe you were
well-intentioned somewhere,

39:14.245 --> 39:16.745
deep, deep down.

39:16.781 --> 39:18.947
Perhaps that counts for something.

39:18.983 --> 39:22.083
I'm glad you think so, son.

39:22.119 --> 39:23.351
Besides,

39:23.387 --> 39:25.954
I'm far more pissed off at Dad.

39:25.990 --> 39:28.723
I mean, you just tried to
speed up feelings I already had,

39:28.759 --> 39:31.059
whereas he...

39:31.095 --> 39:32.594
Well.

39:32.630 --> 39:35.332
He made all those feelings a lie.

39:36.834 --> 39:38.466
Anyway.

39:38.502 --> 39:41.371
Nice catching up. I'll
see you in a few millennia.

39:42.306 --> 39:45.907
Lucifer, wait.

39:45.943 --> 39:48.576
I appreciate your honesty.

39:48.612 --> 39:53.548
And now, I'd like to be honest with you.

39:53.584 --> 39:55.617
Oh. This'll be a hoot.

39:55.653 --> 39:58.053
Since I escaped Hell, all
I've wanted is to get back

39:58.089 --> 40:01.022
to the Silver City,
to reunite our family.

40:01.058 --> 40:03.928
You're still fantasizing
about heavenly rebellion?

40:03.931 --> 40:05.627
Just let it go, Mum.

40:05.663 --> 40:08.296
Been there, done that, big fall.

40:08.332 --> 40:09.597
But that's just it.

40:09.633 --> 40:11.900
Why do you think you lost that fight?

40:11.936 --> 40:14.002
Oh, I don't know, let's
have a think, shall we?

40:14.038 --> 40:15.236
Not enough cardio?

40:15.272 --> 40:17.806
The fact that dear old
Dad's slightly almighty?

40:17.842 --> 40:20.241
Because I was young,
woefully foolish and...

40:20.277 --> 40:21.687
Unarmed?

40:21.690 --> 40:24.346
You know that if you had
possessed the Flaming Sword,

40:24.348 --> 40:26.648
the weapon that guarded Eden,

40:26.651 --> 40:28.626
the weapon that can
cut through anything,

40:28.700 --> 40:30.352
even the Gates of Heaven itself,

40:30.388 --> 40:32.787
well, you would've won that rebellion.

40:32.823 --> 40:34.322
Why are you dwelling in the past?

40:34.358 --> 40:35.857
The fact is, I didn't have the sword,

40:35.893 --> 40:38.860
and Dad destroyed it soon after, so...

40:38.896 --> 40:41.596
What if I told you that
the sword was right here,

40:41.632 --> 40:42.964
on Earth?

40:43.015 --> 40:45.248
And it's already in your possession.

40:45.269 --> 40:46.236
What?

40:46.239 --> 40:49.471
The Flaming Sword is Azrael's blade.

40:49.507 --> 40:52.842
We have everything we need to go home.

41:03.788 --> 41:08.156
Well, the Oscar goes
to Candy Morningstar.

41:08.192 --> 41:09.524
You think they bought it?

41:09.560 --> 41:11.614
Yes, my mother doesn't
know what hit her.

41:11.617 --> 41:12.949
So, thank you.

41:12.952 --> 41:15.972
For helping me peek inside
that scheming head of hers.

41:15.975 --> 41:18.676
Well, it's the least I could do.

41:18.679 --> 41:20.444
After what you did for me in Vegas?

41:20.480 --> 41:22.413
You saved my life.

41:22.449 --> 41:24.849
Pretty sure I'm gonna owe
you for the rest of it.

41:24.885 --> 41:26.450
Let's call it even, shall we?

41:26.486 --> 41:27.752
Yeah.

41:27.788 --> 41:29.320
Oh, that reminds me

41:29.356 --> 41:30.588
Oh, no, no, no.

41:30.624 --> 41:31.589
You keep that.

41:31.625 --> 41:32.857
I hear divorce

41:32.893 --> 41:34.425
is quite expensive these days.

41:34.461 --> 41:35.726
In fact,

41:35.762 --> 41:38.362
why don't you add this
one to the, uh, pot?

41:38.398 --> 41:40.298
Thank you.

41:40.334 --> 41:41.999
I'll put them both to good use.

41:42.035 --> 41:45.603
(ditzy voice): 'Cause, you know,
I totally have so many plans.

41:45.639 --> 41:46.906
- (both laugh)
- Oh, God.

41:48.508 --> 41:50.374
Well, to making plans.

41:50.410 --> 41:52.044
Yeah.

41:54.114 --> 41:56.048
All right.

42:01.388 --> 42:02.855
Lucifer.

42:03.783 --> 42:06.123
I get why you had me con your family.

42:06.159 --> 42:09.860
But what is going on with
you and Detective Decker?

42:09.896 --> 42:11.295
