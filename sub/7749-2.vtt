WEBVTT

00:16.150 --> 00:18.141
How are you?

00:18.180 --> 00:19.818
I'm good.

00:19.850 --> 00:22.318
You've got five minutes.

00:22.350 --> 00:24.318
Uh...

00:24.350 --> 00:27.057
I tried to_ cancel the D_ee_na
Gross meeting, but she InSIsted.

00:27.090 --> 00:28.284
Yeah, she'll be nervous.

00:28.320 --> 00:30.322
Just tell her they arrested me,
because...

00:30.360 --> 00:32.555
You're working too hard for your
clients? I did.

00:32.600 --> 00:34.158
She still wants to talk.

00:34.200 --> 00:36.065
Fine. Bring Carey Zepps
into the meeting.

00:36.100 --> 00:38.625
She feels more comfortable
with men in charge.

00:38.670 --> 00:40.535
I'm trying
to call Neil Gross...

00:40.570 --> 00:42.663
N-N-No, no. Don't do that.
This is all about his wife.

00:42.710 --> 00:45.167
She's still house
counsel for Chumhum,

00:45.210 --> 00:46.507
so he's giving her the authority
over the antitrust case.

00:46.540 --> 00:47.507
The class action?
Right.

00:47.540 --> 00:49.098
Some of the coders claim

00:49.150 --> 00:50.378
there was a conspiracy
between Chumhum

00:50.410 --> 00:52.116
and some of the other tech firms

00:52.150 --> 00:53.549
to hold down salaries
and stop poaching employees.

00:53.580 --> 00:55.343
Well, I ran through the files,

00:55.380 --> 00:57.189
and they don't want
to go to trial.
That's right.

00:57.220 --> 00:59.085
They feel betrayed by
their own coders for suing them.

00:59.120 --> 01:00.417
So they want to make
an example of them.

01:00.460 --> 01:02.451
So, scare them off
in depositions.
Yes.

01:02.490 --> 01:04.583
If we don't shut this down,
they will leave us.

01:07.230 --> 01:10.722
That's why Deena was meeting
with Lockhart/Gardner.

01:10.770 --> 01:12.431
Does she lgnow _that Diane
IS coming With us?

01:12.470 --> 01:14.062
What?

01:15.840 --> 01:17.603
Does Mrs. Gross know

01:17.640 --> 01:21.474
that Diane Lockhart is leaving
Lockhart/Gardner and joining us?

01:21.510 --> 01:24.172
I didn't know
she was coming to us.

01:24.210 --> 01:26.246
Cary.
What?

01:26.280 --> 01:27.872
I'm a named partner, Alicia, you
can't decide this without me.

01:27.920 --> 01:29.114
We have to move forward.

01:29.150 --> 01:30.412
And I have no idea

01:30.450 --> 01:31.439
when you're gonna get
out of here.

01:31.490 --> 01:32.889
I'll be out in 24 hours.

01:32.920 --> 01:35.286
And we will lose Diane
if we don't decide now.

01:35.320 --> 01:37.652
So, the equity partners
already voted to bring her in?

01:37.690 --> 01:39.692
We haven't gotten that far, yet.

01:39.730 --> 01:41.357
Cary, we don't have
a lot of time.

01:41.400 --> 01:42.765
Will it matter to Chumhum

01:42.800 --> 01:45.189
if they know
Diane is coming with us?

01:45.230 --> 01:46.788
It'll matter
to Neil Gross.

01:46.840 --> 01:48.193
It won't matter
to Deena.

01:48.240 --> 01:50.231
And don't call
her Mrs. Gross.

01:50.270 --> 01:51.760
She goes by her
maiden name, Lampard.

01:51.810 --> 01:54.199
SHERIFF:
That's it. Stand up.

01:54.240 --> 01:56.140
Uh, what about
the deposition strategy?

01:56.180 --> 01:57.807
I'll be out
before then.
In case you're not.

01:57.850 --> 02:00.148
Hands behind your back.
Why? What's going on?

02:00.180 --> 02:02.910
Cary, the depositions.
What's the strategy?

02:02.950 --> 02:04.781
It's too hard to go
after all 38 coders.

02:04.820 --> 02:06.583
Look at my files.

02:06.620 --> 02:09.350
I focused my fire on the
senior coder, Gus Pawlicky.

02:09.390 --> 02:12.257
DIANE: Your Honor,
he has spent five days in jail.

02:12.300 --> 02:13.449
POLMAR:
Yeah, because he's charged

02:13.500 --> 02:15.252
with conspiracy
to transport heroin.

02:15.300 --> 02:17.291
DIANE: No, because the ASA
is trying to punish him.

02:17.330 --> 02:18.922
We have supplied the court
with his bail.

02:18.970 --> 02:21.438
POLMAR: And we have asked
for a source of funds hearing.

02:21.470 --> 02:23.768
The burden of proof is reversed
here, Your Honor.

02:23.810 --> 02:25.368
The defense must show that
the bail money is legitimate

02:25.410 --> 02:27.230
and does not come
from drug proceeds.

02:27.280 --> 02:28.702
And that is why
I have submitted

02:28.740 --> 02:30.276
this affidavit
from Dexter Roja.

02:30.310 --> 02:32.244
The bail money comes
from his business not...

02:32.280 --> 02:33.816
Mr. Roja, who is
intimately connected

02:33.850 --> 02:35.579
with Lemond Bishop,
a top drug dealer.

02:35.620 --> 02:38.441
Just allow me to question
Mr. Bishop. That's all I ask.

02:38.490 --> 02:40.708
And what is the harm
in that, Mrs. Lockhart?
The harm...

02:40.760 --> 02:45.322
Excuse me, I need both of you
to step back behind the bar.

02:47.660 --> 02:50.299
The harm is that this is
a Trojan horse hearing.

02:50.330 --> 02:53.458
The ASA does not care
about the source of funds.

02:53.500 --> 02:57.607
He wants to question Mr. Bishop
under oath about his business.

02:57.640 --> 02:59.733
Which the defense only fears
because Mr. Bishop will withdraw

02:59.780 --> 03:01.475
his illegal funds if threatened
with questioning.

03:01.510 --> 03:04.502
JUDGE: And yet, I'm perusing
an affidavit here

03:04.550 --> 03:05.972
swearing to the fact that these
funds are legally obtained.

03:06.010 --> 03:08.240
So, why doesn't that suffice?

03:08.280 --> 03:09.838
POLMAR:
I believe it is a lie.

03:09.890 --> 03:10.982
JUDGE:
Okay, so what now?

03:11.020 --> 03:12.658
Let me call a witness,

03:12.690 --> 03:14.214
a hostile witness,
who I think

03:14.260 --> 03:15.318
will tell the truth
no matter what.

03:15.360 --> 03:16.327
VVho?

03:16.360 --> 03:17.384
Alicia Florrick.

03:21.300 --> 03:23.689
Can she hurt us?

03:23.730 --> 03:24.958
I don't know, maybe.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.888
Well, we have
another problem.

03:26.940 --> 03:29.431
Oh, good. More.

03:29.470 --> 03:30.903
I know what evidence

03:30.940 --> 03:32.976
they have
against you.

03:33.010 --> 03:34.272
Okay. What?

03:34.310 --> 03:35.299
A wire.

03:35.340 --> 03:36.773
That's good.

03:36.810 --> 03:39.005
I-I didn't tell Bishop's crew
how to break the law.

03:39.050 --> 03:40.779
What?

03:40.820 --> 03:42.913
You did.

03:42.950 --> 03:45.544
No, I didn't.
I heard it, Cary.

03:45.590 --> 03:48.013
You heard a tape of me
telling Bishop's crew

03:48.060 --> 03:51.257
how to smuggle $1.3 million
in heroin into the country?

03:51.290 --> 03:53.758
And how to sell it
without getting caught.

03:57.500 --> 03:59.889
Then it's a fake.

04:01.340 --> 04:02.830
Well, we still
have options...

04:02.870 --> 04:04.337
Well, wait a minute,

04:04.370 --> 04:06.975
I didn't do this.

04:07.010 --> 04:08.807
And I don't know
what you heard, Kalinda,

04:08.840 --> 04:12.776
but I was asked questions
by three crew members

04:12.820 --> 04:15.641
in Bishop's crew,
and I made it very clear

04:15.680 --> 04:17.386
that I couldn't advise
them on anything.

04:17.420 --> 04:18.614
But you answered
their questions?

04:18.650 --> 04:19.810
Only their hypothetical
questions.

04:19.860 --> 04:21.054
Was the tape edited?

04:21.090 --> 04:22.853
Possibly.

04:22.890 --> 04:25.620
Well then we need the testimony
of the three crew members.

04:25.660 --> 04:27.958
Only those three
can contradict the wire.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.695
Only those two.

04:29.730 --> 04:31.561
One of them was wearing
the wire.

04:31.600 --> 04:34.569
CAREY: Thank you
for meeting us here.

04:34.600 --> 04:36.431
We just want you
to know, Mrs. Gross...

04:36.470 --> 04:37.903
Ms. Lampard.

04:37.940 --> 04:40.932
Right. Uh, we just want you
to know that Cary was targeted

04:40.980 --> 04:43.574
by the ASA's office because he's
so effective for his clients.

04:43.610 --> 04:45.475
That still doesn't do me
much good if he's in jail.

04:47.450 --> 04:50.442
That's why Alicia and I are
handling the deposition prep.

04:50.490 --> 04:53.948
Carey, could you take Deena
through our strategy?

04:53.990 --> 04:56.481
Mr. Bishop. Hello.
Do we have an appointment?

04:56.530 --> 04:57.758
No.

04:59.930 --> 05:01.659
Just Mrs. Florrick,
please.

05:11.910 --> 05:13.878
You need an office with a door.

05:13.910 --> 05:16.902
Yes, we're putting one in.

05:16.950 --> 05:18.645
I understand you're testifying
today about the bail money.

05:18.680 --> 05:21.410
Yes, Diane just called me.

05:22.790 --> 05:24.348
I want you to know something...

05:24.390 --> 05:26.915
(loud banging)

05:26.960 --> 05:29.053
(chattering)

05:29.090 --> 05:30.887
(vacuum whirring)

05:32.930 --> 05:38.027
If they make me testify,
the bail money goes away.

05:38.070 --> 05:39.731
Do you understand?

05:42.540 --> 05:45.532
B-But hasn't your state
had more murders per capita

05:45.570 --> 05:48.038
than any other state,
Mr. Governor?

05:48.080 --> 05:51.402
Well, I think our state has
the same gun problems

05:51.450 --> 05:53.418
of any large state.

05:53.450 --> 05:56.544
I do think we try harder
to enforce our gun laws.

05:56.590 --> 05:59.912
WOMAN:
Crime will be
his undoing, Eli.

05:59.960 --> 06:02.758
You sound like a
Republican, Ms. Jarrett.

06:02.790 --> 06:03.984
Mm, I sound like a voter.

06:04.030 --> 06:05.520
A voter?
Yeah. Yeah, a voter.

06:05.560 --> 06:07.994
Oh. How's Washington, voter?

06:08.030 --> 06:10.521
Oh, Eli. Are you
still pouting?

06:10.570 --> 06:12.458
Why would I be pouting?

06:12.500 --> 06:14.388
Oh, because you didn't
hire me at the White House

06:14.440 --> 06:16.863
after expressly
promising to do so.

06:16.910 --> 06:18.639
I didn't promise a thing.
That was all in your head.

06:18.670 --> 06:19.978
NORAH:
But what about your wife?

06:20.010 --> 06:22.137
What are her views on gun laws?

06:22.180 --> 06:24.774
PETER:
Well, the last thing I want to
do is to speak for my wife.

06:24.810 --> 06:25.947
ANCHOR: Well, she
has represented

06:25.980 --> 06:27.572
some pretty hardened
criminals, hasn't she?

06:27.620 --> 06:28.644
PETER: Yes, that's because
she's a good lavwer.

06:28.680 --> 06:30.489
She represents the sinners
and the saints, but...

06:30.520 --> 06:32.511
"Sinners and saints,"
is that you?

06:32.560 --> 06:34.516
I never sign my canvases.

06:36.890 --> 06:39.597
When are you heading back
to DC?

06:39.630 --> 06:41.951
Monday. Why?

06:42.000 --> 06:43.661
Your into women running
for office, aren't you?

06:45.000 --> 06:46.695
What do you need, Eli?

06:46.740 --> 06:48.560
I need you to help convince
a woman to run.

06:48.600 --> 06:50.534
VVho?

06:50.570 --> 06:51.537
Norah O'Donnell.

06:51.570 --> 06:53.538
No.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.730
Alicia Florrick.

06:55.780 --> 06:56.872
(gavelbangs)

06:56.910 --> 07:00.016
BAILIFF:
Case number 14CR3866.

07:00.050 --> 07:01.870
Good afternoon, Mrs. Florrick.

07:01.920 --> 07:04.138
Mr. Polmar.

07:04.190 --> 07:08.149
Who supplied the $1.3 million
for Cary Agos' bail?

07:08.190 --> 07:11.489
Dexter Roja,
one of our clients.

07:11.530 --> 07:13.896
And he's a
busmessman?
Yes.

07:13.930 --> 07:18.492
And a very generous businessman,
by the look of things.

07:18.530 --> 07:19.633
I can't speak to that.

07:19.670 --> 07:21.535
Well, you have to be
pretty generous

07:21.570 --> 07:23.458
to give $1.3 million to
someone that you hardly know.

07:23.510 --> 07:25.603
Objection. Was that a question?

07:25.640 --> 07:26.629
Let me rephrase.

07:26.680 --> 07:27.999
You have to be pretty generous

07:28.040 --> 07:30.144
to give $1.3 million
to someone that you hardly know?

07:30.180 --> 07:32.239
ALICIA:
It would be inaccurate to say

07:32.280 --> 07:34.646
that Dexter Roja
hardly knows Cary.

07:34.680 --> 07:35.908
Hmm, I see.

07:35.950 --> 07:37.679
How many times
has Mr. Roja met Cary in person?

07:37.720 --> 07:38.914
I'm not sure.

07:38.950 --> 07:41.180
More than three times?

07:41.220 --> 07:42.653
DIANE: Objection,
Mrs. Florrick has already stated

07:42.690 --> 07:43.952
that she is not sure.

07:43.990 --> 07:44.957
POLMAR:
Yeah, I'll withdraw.

07:44.990 --> 07:46.651
Is it your understanding

07:46.700 --> 07:48.520
that Mr. Roja's money came from
his health club business?

07:48.560 --> 07:50.790
That is correct, Mr. Polmar.

07:50.830 --> 07:53.663
Isn't Mr. Roja a long-time
associate of Lemond Bishop?

07:53.700 --> 07:56.134
Objection, Your Honor-- vague.

07:56.170 --> 07:57.159
What is vague?

07:57.210 --> 07:58.632
"Long time" or "associate"?

07:58.670 --> 08:00.672
Both.

08:00.710 --> 08:02.678
No, uh, I find them both clear.
Overruled.

08:04.150 --> 08:08.712
Yes, Mr. Roja, at one time,
worked for Mr. Bishop.

08:08.750 --> 08:10.183
In his... drug empire.

08:10.220 --> 08:12.040
Objection-- not in evidence.

08:12.090 --> 08:13.557
Sustained.

08:13.590 --> 08:15.057
Mrs. Florrick,

08:15.090 --> 08:17.650
when Mr. Roja gave you
this money,

08:17.690 --> 08:19.590
was Mr. Bishop present?

08:19.630 --> 08:22.019
Yes.

08:22.060 --> 08:24.597
He was there?
Mr. Bishop was there?

08:26.100 --> 08:28.489
Yes, but on another matter.

08:31.710 --> 08:34.031
Uh, does the ASA have
any more questions?

08:34.080 --> 08:35.729
Hmm.

08:35.780 --> 08:36.906
Yes, I do.

08:39.250 --> 08:41.775
POLMAR:
Mrs. Florrick,

08:41.820 --> 08:44.618
could you please tell me...

08:48.090 --> 08:51.719
Huh.

08:51.760 --> 08:54.194
Could you please tell me
what this is?

09:00.600 --> 09:02.830
It appears to be a master
membership roster

09:02.870 --> 09:04.633
of Mr. Roja's health clubs.

09:04.670 --> 09:06.706
Yes, it is. Thank you.

09:06.740 --> 09:08.002
Quite a few members.

09:08.040 --> 09:09.746
I believe it does very well.

09:09.780 --> 09:11.008
Oh, very well.

09:11.050 --> 09:12.608
Could you also tell me
what this is, please?

09:12.650 --> 09:15.312
ALICIA:
The death certificate inventory

09:15.350 --> 09:17.147
from the county
medical examiner.

09:17.190 --> 09:20.057
POLMAR:
Yes, it is. Thank you again.

09:20.090 --> 09:22.354
It is a list of people who have
died in the last two years.

09:22.390 --> 09:25.257
Could you compare
the highlighted names there

09:25.290 --> 09:27.622
with the membership roster
from the health clubs?

09:27.660 --> 09:29.321
Your Honor,
what does this have to do

09:29.360 --> 09:30.896
with our source
of funds hearing?

09:30.930 --> 09:32.591
POLMAR: Dexter Roja's bail money
came from his business.

09:32.640 --> 09:34.733
20 percent of his business came
from people who are dead.

09:34.770 --> 09:35.759
All right, let me see that.

09:35.800 --> 09:37.904
His business is a sham.

09:37.940 --> 09:39.737
It is a cover

09:39.780 --> 09:41.771
for laundering
Mr. Bishop's drug proceeds.

09:41.810 --> 09:42.970
And if I were
allowed...

09:45.150 --> 09:47.243
If I were allowed
to question Mr. Bishop,

09:47.280 --> 09:48.611
then this would become evid...

09:48.650 --> 09:50.686
Your Honor,
you have already quashed

09:50.720 --> 09:52.711
Mr. Bishop's
subpoena.
Yes, but we would suggest

09:52.760 --> 09:54.910
that Mrs. Florrick's testimony
has opened that question again.

09:54.960 --> 09:56.655
DIANE: Your Honor,
there is nothing new here.

09:56.690 --> 09:59.727
No, uh, actually there is.

09:59.760 --> 10:03.298
Okay, I'm gonna allow
Mr. Bishop to be subpoenaed.

10:03.330 --> 10:05.321
POLMAR:
Thank you, Your Honor.

10:22.420 --> 10:24.217
(applause)
Thank you, thank you.

10:24.250 --> 10:27.754
It feels good to be home
after the wilds of New York.

10:27.790 --> 10:30.657
(laughter)
And, uh, you were all
missed out there.

10:30.690 --> 10:33.295
Well, maybe not you, David.

10:33.330 --> 10:34.399
(laughter)

10:34.430 --> 10:35.829
Thank you, Dean.

10:35.860 --> 10:37.691
Good to finally have you near.

10:37.730 --> 10:41.166
Which brings us to our last item
of business today. Diane.

10:41.200 --> 10:43.964
Yes.

10:44.010 --> 10:46.877
After founding this firm
13 years ago,

10:46.910 --> 10:49.947
and seeing it turn
from a small corporate nonentity

10:49.980 --> 10:52.301
to one of the two top law firms
in Chicago,

10:52.350 --> 10:54.443
Iﬁnd
that it's time to...

10:54.480 --> 10:57.449
it's time for me to resign.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.856
Diane.
Thank you, but
I've given this, um,

10:59.890 --> 11:00.857
a lot of thought.

11:00.890 --> 11:02.152
I am married now, and I...

11:02.190 --> 11:06.229
Diane has graciously agreed
to hand over

11:06.260 --> 11:09.889
the managing partner
reigns to Mr. Canning,

11:09.930 --> 11:11.898
who is unfortunately
out sick today.

11:11.930 --> 11:14.990
But let's give a round
of applause to Diane Lockhart.

11:16.070 --> 11:19.198
Okay, what's going on?

11:19.240 --> 11:20.878
What do you mean?

11:20.910 --> 11:23.879
Diane, you recruited me.

11:23.910 --> 11:25.070
I'm here because of you.

11:25.110 --> 11:27.374
And now you resign?

11:32.450 --> 11:34.156
(elevator bell dings)

11:37.260 --> 11:39.387
MAN:
Hold the elevator?

11:42.930 --> 11:44.397
I'm going
to Florrick-Agos.

11:44.430 --> 11:46.990
(laughs)

11:47.040 --> 11:48.098
You're kidding me.

11:48.140 --> 11:50.062
In a week.
No one knows I'm going.

11:50.110 --> 11:51.964
No one at
Lockhart/Gardner.

11:52.010 --> 11:53.307
What about
your clients?
Alicia Florrick is meeting

11:53.340 --> 11:55.831
with them individually
to encourage them to follow me.

11:55.880 --> 11:56.904
I can't do that.

11:56.950 --> 11:59.009
I have a fiduciary
responsibility

11:59.050 --> 12:00.312
to Lockhart/Gardner.
Diane, this
is crazy.

12:00.350 --> 12:02.511
You're leaving the
biggest firm in Chicago

12:02.550 --> 12:04.188
for a start-up?

12:04.220 --> 12:05.812
Yes.

12:05.850 --> 12:08.011
Come with me.

12:08.060 --> 12:09.755
It's a good firm,
Dean.

12:09.790 --> 12:12.054
Go to Florrick-Agos
and see for yourself.

12:12.090 --> 12:14.490
(sighs)

12:14.530 --> 12:17.090
(footsteps approaching)

12:22.440 --> 12:25.068
Bishop withdrew the bail money.

12:28.040 --> 12:30.508
I'm gonna spend a year in here
waiting for trial.

12:30.550 --> 12:32.404
I still have other options.

12:32.450 --> 12:34.941
I'm looking into a second
mortgage on my apartment.

12:34.980 --> 12:37.187
Alicia, you can't do that.
I can. I'm meeting today.

12:37.220 --> 12:39.381
It's very generous,
but seriously.

12:39.420 --> 12:42.253
Stop it. You would do
the same thing.

12:44.590 --> 12:47.127
You have to take
the deposition today.

12:47.160 --> 12:48.525
I'll reschedule.
You can't.

12:48.560 --> 12:51.063
Deena will take her business
to Lockhart/Gardner.

12:51.100 --> 12:53.898
Bring Carey Zepps into the
depo and have him whisper

12:53.940 --> 12:56.568
in your ear every now
and then for effect.

12:56.600 --> 12:59.103
Who's on the other side?

12:59.140 --> 13:01.233
Lorainne Joy,
Clements & Holloway.

13:01.280 --> 13:03.145
You're kidding.
What?

13:04.880 --> 13:06.814
Why?

13:06.850 --> 13:08.579
Alicia, how are you?

13:08.620 --> 13:10.144
I'm good, Lorainne.
How are you?

13:10.190 --> 13:11.316
Good, good, good.

13:11.350 --> 13:13.159
I'm excited
about facing off finally.

13:13.190 --> 13:16.887
I hope that all is forgiven
about me not hiring you.

13:16.930 --> 13:19.057
But look at you now.

13:19.090 --> 13:21.126
What a perfectly
adorable office.

13:21.160 --> 13:23.196
Should we get started?

13:23.230 --> 13:25.460
The first deposition
is Gus Pawlicky.

13:25.500 --> 13:27.832
He's their top coder.
He's the linchin?
Yeah.

13:27.870 --> 13:30.100
The rest of the class action
crumbles if you destroy him.

13:30.140 --> 13:33.177
And how long have you worked
at Chumhum, Mr. Pawlicky?

13:33.210 --> 13:34.199
H was fired.

13:34.240 --> 13:36.504
But seven years total.

13:36.540 --> 13:38.542
Until you discovered
this Chumhum price-fixing.

13:38.580 --> 13:41.014
Ms. Joy, do you mind?

13:41.050 --> 13:43.314
PAWLICKY:
Chumhum had a handshake deal

13:43.350 --> 13:46.888
with other social networking
companies.

13:46.920 --> 13:48.285
A week later, I was fired.

13:48.320 --> 13:50.185
CAREY: I'm whispering something
that looks important

13:50.230 --> 13:51.128
so Deena thinks
I'm in control.

13:51.160 --> 13:52.889
ALICIA:
Thank you, Carey.

13:52.930 --> 13:55.023
Do you need a minute
with Alicia to help her?

13:56.060 --> 13:58.164
His lawyer will try
and shut you down,

13:58.200 --> 14:00.168
but start in with questions
about his drinking.

14:00.200 --> 14:02.532
My drinking?

14:02.570 --> 14:05.004
Yes. You were pulled over
on the afternoon of May 19?

14:05.040 --> 14:08.009
Yes, H was upset.

14:08.040 --> 14:10.042
That was the day I found out
about the agreement.

14:10.080 --> 14:12.071
The price-fixing
agreement.

14:12.110 --> 14:12.872
So, because of that discovery,
you decided to get drunk?

14:12.920 --> 14:15.309
I had a-a couple
of beers at lunch.

14:15.350 --> 14:17.887
And_ that's all. _
You received a negative

14:17.920 --> 14:20.411
performance evaluation
in the previous week.

14:20.460 --> 14:21.654
Your supervisor wrote
that he smelled alcohol

14:21.690 --> 14:23.885
on your breath.
That's
a lie.

14:23.930 --> 14:25.625
That was, uh, a fluoride
rinse.
And three other
negative evaluations

14:25.660 --> 14:28.299
_ in the months
prior to your being let go.

14:28.330 --> 14:32.198
Repeated lateness, failure
to accomplish assigned tasks...

14:32.230 --> 14:35.028
Th-They planted those
and they backdated them.

14:35.070 --> 14:37.607
Did they also backdate
this accusation

14:37.640 --> 14:39.130
of your sexting?
What?

14:39.170 --> 14:40.637
That was a-a prank.
Alicia.

14:40.680 --> 14:42.602
I think your partner wants
to confer with you.

14:42.640 --> 14:44.301
No, we're good.

14:44.350 --> 14:47.444
Let's go through these
sexts one at a time.

14:47.480 --> 14:49.368
I told you.

14:49.420 --> 14:50.944
I don't want you
investigating my crew.

14:50.990 --> 14:53.550
This isn't an investigation,
Mr. Bishop.

14:53.590 --> 14:55.979
I just need to get statements
from three of your crew.

14:56.020 --> 14:58.454
That's all. It's
to back up Cary's vers...

14:58.490 --> 14:59.923
Foul!

14:59.960 --> 15:01.154
That was a foul, ref!

15:04.630 --> 15:06.097
I heard there
was a tape.

15:06.130 --> 15:07.563
You know anything about it?

15:10.110 --> 15:11.668
No.

15:11.710 --> 15:13.371
If someone in my crew is
betraying me, I need to...

15:13.410 --> 15:14.968
Go, Dylan!

15:15.010 --> 15:16.409
You got it!

15:16.440 --> 15:17.543
Go, go, go!

15:17.580 --> 15:18.979
(groans in disappointment)

15:19.010 --> 15:20.216
(whistle blows)

15:20.250 --> 15:22.275
Nice try, Dylan.

15:22.320 --> 15:24.538
Keep your head up, buddy.

15:24.590 --> 15:26.717
If someone's wearing a
wire, I need to know.

15:26.750 --> 15:28.980
Me knowing helps you
and your lawyer.

15:29.020 --> 15:31.386
I wish I knew more, sir,
but, uh, I'm in the dark.

15:31.430 --> 15:33.091
Okay.

15:33.130 --> 15:34.597
You can question
my three guys.

15:34.630 --> 15:35.426
Good.

15:35.460 --> 15:37.394
I have time
this afternoon at 5:00.

15:37.430 --> 15:38.988
Actually, you don't need
to be there, Mr. Bishop.

15:39.030 --> 15:41.191
Actually, I do.

15:42.770 --> 15:45.136
We need to
talk settlement.
All right.

15:45.170 --> 15:46.603
But you have to
raise the amount.

15:46.640 --> 15:48.972
I can't take that
to my client.

15:49.010 --> 15:50.477
We'll go as high as $4 million.

15:50.510 --> 15:52.398
For Mr. Pawlicky?

15:52.450 --> 15:53.747
No.

15:53.780 --> 15:55.145
The whole class.

15:55.180 --> 15:57.284
(scoffs)

15:57.320 --> 15:59.015
I'll talk to my clients.

16:02.760 --> 16:04.682
Alicia, there's an Avery
Miller-Siege! on line one.

16:04.730 --> 16:06.482
VVho?

16:06.530 --> 16:08.122
Oh, the bank.

16:10.770 --> 16:15.059
Mr. Miller-Siegel,
it's Alicia Florrick.

16:15.100 --> 16:16.738
It's missus, actually.

16:16.770 --> 16:18.738
I-I'm sorry. It's loud in here.

16:18.770 --> 16:20.670
(loud clattering, shouting)

16:20.710 --> 16:22.575
Mrs. Florrick,
I am happy to inform you

16:22.610 --> 16:24.077
that Certified National Bank
has approved

16:24.110 --> 16:25.372
your second mortgage loan.

16:25.410 --> 16:27.378
Oh, good!

16:27.420 --> 16:28.671
Great. How quickly can we close?

16:28.720 --> 16:30.540
As soon as tomorrow,
if you'd like.

16:30.590 --> 16:31.784
I'll messenger over
the documents

16:31.820 --> 16:33.253
for you and your husband
to sign.

16:33.290 --> 16:35.053
Okay, I'll be...

16:35.090 --> 16:36.387
Uh, my husband?

16:36.420 --> 16:38.058
(loud clattering)

16:38.090 --> 16:40.058
Well, yes, the apartment
is co-owned by your husband.

16:40.100 --> 16:41.522
Isn't that right?

16:41.560 --> 16:43.391
Um, well, yes, technically.

16:43.430 --> 16:46.024
But he-he isn't
a full-time occupant.

16:46.070 --> 16:47.264
Yes, that doesn't matter.

16:47.300 --> 16:48.631
_ I'll still need
his Signature, too,

16:48.670 --> 16:50.035
given he's listed
as a co-tenant.

16:50.070 --> 16:53.073
Alicia, Valerie Jarrett's
on line three.

16:53.110 --> 16:55.032
I'm sorry. What?

16:55.080 --> 16:57.401
A \_/alerie Jarrett is
on line three for you.

16:57.450 --> 16:59.406
Mrs. Florrick?

16:59.450 --> 17:01.543
Um, I'm sorry,
can you hold for one second?

17:01.580 --> 17:03.184
Certainly.

17:03.220 --> 17:05.484
Valerie Jarrett at the
White House Valerie Jarrett?

17:05.520 --> 17:07.488
She didn't say.
You want me to ask?

17:07.520 --> 17:09.750
No. W-What's it regarding?

17:09.790 --> 17:13.055
I have no idea,
she just asked to speak to you.

17:13.100 --> 17:15.694
Mr.... (tools bang)
Mrs. Miller, uh, Siegel,

17:15.730 --> 17:17.288
can I call you
back in a second?

17:17.330 --> 17:18.524
I'll be here until 5:00.

17:18.570 --> 17:19.798
Thank you.

17:19.830 --> 17:20.831
(phone clicks)

17:20.870 --> 17:23.065
Hello? This is Alicia Florrick.

17:23.110 --> 17:25.305
Yes, Alicia.
It's Valerie Jarrett.

17:25.340 --> 17:26.807
How are you doing today?

17:26.840 --> 17:28.535
I'm... good.

17:28.580 --> 17:30.400
Listen, I just wanted
to call and tell you

17:30.450 --> 17:32.771
that I have been an admirer
of yours for many years now.

17:32.810 --> 17:34.778
You-you have?

17:34.820 --> 17:38.483
Yes, yes-- the way you started
your own business, and...

17:38.520 --> 17:40.385
(hushed): What does this say?
What does it say?

17:40.420 --> 17:41.682
"Stuck by your
husband."

17:41.720 --> 17:43.551
I am not saying that.

17:43.590 --> 17:46.787
And I admire the way
you've set your own course.

17:46.830 --> 17:49.321
Uh, well, thank you,

17:49.360 --> 17:51.499
Ms. Jarrett.
Have-have we met before, or...?

17:51.530 --> 17:53.361
No, we haven't, but I heard

17:53.400 --> 17:56.437
that you were contemplating
running for State's Attorney.

17:56.470 --> 17:57.698
(hushed): What?
(hushed):
She'll know it's me!

17:57.740 --> 17:59.162
What do you
want me to say?

17:59.210 --> 18:01.405
Just encouragements,
encouragements.

18:01.440 --> 18:03.101
And I wanted
to encourage you to run.

18:03.150 --> 18:04.777
The only way women are gonna
change the world

18:04.810 --> 18:05.799
is if they step up.

18:05.850 --> 18:07.442
Ms. Jarrett, may I ask,

18:07.480 --> 18:10.608
how did you hear
I was contemplating running?

18:10.650 --> 18:12.186
How? Um, the grapevine.

18:12.220 --> 18:14.154
Um, see, the thing is,
Ms. Jarrett,
The grapevine?

18:14.190 --> 18:16.158
my husband's Chief of Staff,
Eli Gold,

18:16.190 --> 18:18.283
he's the only one contemplating
me running.

18:18.330 --> 18:19.786
Actually, it's
the furthest thing from my mind.

18:19.830 --> 18:21.525
Well, why is that, Alicia?

18:21.560 --> 18:23.699
Why? Because I hate politics.

18:23.730 --> 18:25.766
I do, too, Alicia.

18:25.800 --> 18:29.668
The last person I'd vote for
is someone who liked politics.

18:29.700 --> 18:31.531
We have enough politicians.

18:31.570 --> 18:33.208
We need leaders
who actually understand

18:33.240 --> 18:35.379
what it means
to be a public servant.

18:35.410 --> 18:37.344
Listen, I've got to go.

18:37.380 --> 18:38.699
Promise me you'll think
about it?

18:38.750 --> 18:39.899
I will.

18:39.950 --> 18:42.248
Thank you for calling,
Ms. Jarrett.

18:47.360 --> 18:48.850
What'd she want?

18:48.890 --> 18:50.721
She wanted me to run.

18:50.760 --> 18:52.318
Run where?

18:52.360 --> 18:54.897
I have no idea.

19:20.260 --> 19:21.488
(banging)

19:22.990 --> 19:24.787
ROBYN:
May I help you?

19:24.830 --> 19:28.550
Uh, yeah, is this
Florrick-Agos & Associates?

19:28.600 --> 19:30.227
It is.

19:30.270 --> 19:33.330
We're in the midst of
remodeling-- pardon our dust!

19:33.370 --> 19:34.928
Uh, is Alicia Florrick
here, please?

19:34.970 --> 19:36.938
Uh, no.
She just stepped out.

19:36.970 --> 19:38.733
Okay, Mr. Agos?

19:38.770 --> 19:39.964
Well, no. Sorry.
(chuckles awkwardly)

19:40.010 --> 19:41.773
Do you have any sense
when he'll be back?

19:41.810 --> 19:44.199
Five to ten.

19:44.250 --> 19:45.740
Oh, that's a joke.
I really can't say.

19:45.780 --> 19:47.213
Are you looking
for representation?

19:48.850 --> 19:50.738
Robyn,
the water's cold.

19:50.790 --> 19:52.610
Yeah, I know. They
turned off the hot water

19:52.650 --> 19:54.311
for just an hour.
Are you kidding?

19:54.360 --> 19:56.487
I know, Gunter.
We're all making do!

19:56.520 --> 19:58.852
(door slams shut)
Oh, that's Gunter.

19:58.890 --> 20:00.528
We let him use the
sink in the afternoon.

20:00.560 --> 20:02.790
So, you're looking
for a lawyer?

20:02.830 --> 20:03.967
Uh...

20:04.000 --> 20:05.524
H was.

20:05.570 --> 20:07.367
Oh, no, no, no, no.
We're a good firm.

20:07.400 --> 20:09.231
We're like a funlq
coffeehouse,

20:09.270 --> 20:11.261
with all the great
used couches.

20:11.310 --> 20:13.608
And we make
the be coffee.

20:13.640 --> 20:16.973
I'll get a
lawyer for you.

20:19.410 --> 20:21.970
What the hell, Diane?

20:22.020 --> 20:24.511
(saw buzzing)

20:25.990 --> 20:28.959
DIANE: So, Cary did not advise
you to break the law?

20:28.990 --> 20:30.628
We were telling stories,
that's all.

20:30.660 --> 20:34.494
DIANE: Stories that had
no basis in truth?

20:34.530 --> 20:36.293
Look, all we were saying
is that

20:36.330 --> 20:38.321
if people did the stuff
that they saw in the movies,

20:38.370 --> 20:39.928
we'd all be in jail.

20:39.970 --> 20:42.632
And Cary was saying what would
be good advice for those people.

20:42.670 --> 20:43.864
That's all.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.468
DIANE: The people
in the movies?

20:45.510 --> 20:47.933
Mm-hmm. Like-- if the guy in the
movie did this or that,

20:47.980 --> 20:49.675
then he wouldn't get caught.

20:49.710 --> 20:51.041
Exactly.

20:51.080 --> 20:52.900
We weren't talking about
anything real.

20:52.950 --> 20:53.939
We're not that stupid.

20:53.980 --> 20:56.039
DIANE: So you can
all substantiate

20:56.080 --> 20:58.412
that Cary was speaking
in hypotheticals only?

20:58.450 --> 20:59.917
That's right.

20:59.950 --> 21:03.283
Hypotheticals only.

21:03.330 --> 21:05.787
The one with the silver teeth.
Jim Lenard.

21:05.830 --> 21:08.025
DIANE:
He'll make a good witness--
he's likable.

21:08.060 --> 21:11.029
So is Trey.

21:11.070 --> 21:13.334
Trey was the one
wearing the wire.

21:13.370 --> 21:15.065
You said you didn't know
who was wearing the wire.

21:15.100 --> 21:17.307
I didn't, until today.

21:17.340 --> 21:18.659
His voice was the loudest

21:18.710 --> 21:21.372
on the tape-- microphone
was on him. It's Trey.

21:22.510 --> 21:24.398
_ DIANE:
Didn't you say that

21:24.450 --> 21:26.338
he's Bishop's top man?
Yeah.

21:26.380 --> 21:28.712
And we can't tell Bishop,
or he'll have him killed.

21:35.520 --> 21:37.488
I can't sign this.

21:37.530 --> 21:39.851
Yes, you can.
This is money

21:39.890 --> 21:41.050
for Cary's bail?
Money that will

21:41.100 --> 21:42.988
come back to me.
Mm-hmm.

21:43.030 --> 21:45.089
After the trial.
Peter, it's a formality.

21:45.130 --> 21:46.461
The apartment's mine.

21:46.500 --> 21:47.865
Yes. And I'm the Governor

21:47.900 --> 21:49.333
of Illinois.

21:49.370 --> 21:51.031
IfI sign off
on a loan for bail

21:51.070 --> 21:52.935
for an accused
drug dealer...
Cary's not an...

21:52.970 --> 21:55.336
It's not about what he is;
it's about what it looks like.

21:55.380 --> 21:57.109
No one's ever gonna know.
Until they do.

21:57.140 --> 21:59.608
You should know this
better than anyone.

21:59.650 --> 22:02.016
(finger tapping)
Documents don't go away.

22:02.050 --> 22:03.586
Your signature

22:03.620 --> 22:05.349
doesn't go away.

22:05.390 --> 22:07.017
You're punishing me.

22:07.050 --> 22:08.551
What?

22:08.590 --> 22:09.852
For how things have unfolded

22:09.890 --> 22:12.029
these last few months,
you and me.

22:12.060 --> 22:14.699
You want to be angry
at me, be angry at me,

22:14.730 --> 22:15.924
but don't punish Cary!

22:15.960 --> 22:17.393
Okay, okay.

22:17.430 --> 22:18.863
It was good seeing you.

22:18.900 --> 22:20.390
You're going?

22:20.440 --> 22:23.898
I can't sign off on your loan.

22:25.440 --> 22:26.930
And neither
should you.

22:26.970 --> 22:29.006
It's just not a smart move.

22:31.080 --> 22:33.913
Maybe I just wanted to believe
you'd do the right thing.

22:33.950 --> 22:35.577
Because the man I married

22:35.620 --> 22:37.781
would have.

22:37.820 --> 22:39.788
Well, that's interesting.

22:39.820 --> 22:42.380
Because the woman I married
never would have asked.

22:48.660 --> 22:51.128
(door opens, closes)

22:58.870 --> 23:01.009
So... do we
have a deal?

23:01.040 --> 23:02.974
No. Actually,

23:03.010 --> 23:04.898
I think we should continue
with our depositions.

23:04.950 --> 23:06.474
Really?

23:06.510 --> 23:09.638
Who should
we depose?
Her.

23:09.680 --> 23:10.908
That's not a law firm.

23:10.950 --> 23:12.508
(laughs):
It's... it's a frat house.

23:12.550 --> 23:14.757
They have some issues.
No, no, no, no.

23:14.790 --> 23:17.429
Issues... issues can be solved.

23:17.460 --> 23:19.826
I'm talking about
structural oddities.

23:19.860 --> 23:22.192
I mean, the inmates are
running the asylum.
Alicia's been distracted.

23:22.230 --> 23:25.199
By the fact that
her partner's in jail.
Look,

23:25.230 --> 23:26.561
they're rough around the edges

23:26.600 --> 23:27.931
because they're
just starting up.

23:27.970 --> 23:29.995
But start-ups have
their advantages.

23:30.040 --> 23:33.430
I mean, don't you
feel stifled here?

23:33.480 --> 23:34.936
I mean, wouldn't you
love an opportunity

23:34.980 --> 23:36.902
to build a firm
the way you want?

23:36.940 --> 23:38.669
(scoffs)
Not if it looks like that.

23:38.710 --> 23:40.678
Forget what Florrick-Agos
looks like now.

23:40.720 --> 23:43.075
What can it turn into?

23:43.120 --> 23:45.941
I mean, a firm with a mission,
with a real...

23:45.990 --> 23:48.185
minority initiative,

23:48.220 --> 23:50.484
with woman and people
of color in authority.

23:50.530 --> 23:52.680
All you're seeing are...
are roadblocks.

23:52.730 --> 23:55.619
See an opportunity
to build our future

23:55.660 --> 23:57.491
exactly how we want it to be.

24:02.740 --> 24:05.766
Poaching was and is

24:05.810 --> 24:08.506
a problem
in the tech industry, yes.

24:08.540 --> 24:10.770
You invest time and money
in an employee,

24:10.810 --> 24:13.517
only to see them leave.
Yes, but if you're
asking if Chumhum

24:13.550 --> 24:15.609
had a secret agreement
with other companies

24:15.650 --> 24:17.481
to hold down salaries

24:17.520 --> 24:20.489
or to clamp down on poaching,
no, absolutely not.

24:20.520 --> 24:21.987
Okay. Can you tell me
what that is, please?

24:24.060 --> 24:26.028
_ DEENA: _
Uh, it's a copy of an e-mail.

24:26.060 --> 24:29.621
From Patric Edelstein,
CEO of Sleuthway, to you.

24:29.660 --> 24:31.491
Can you read it?
May I...

24:31.530 --> 24:32.895
(power saw whirring loudly)

24:32.930 --> 24:35.535
May I see a copy, please?

24:35.570 --> 24:36.491
Certainly.
Here you go, Alicia.

24:36.540 --> 24:37.199
LORAINNE:
Ms. Lampard,

24:37.240 --> 24:38.730
if you wouldn't mind?

24:38.770 --> 24:42.228
"About the agreement
we discussed... I'm in.

24:42.280 --> 24:45.647
"Sick of losing
all my best people to you.

24:45.680 --> 24:48.012
XX. Patric."
I'm sorry, what does this prove?

24:48.050 --> 24:50.041
Mr. Edelstein sent her
a vague e-mail.

24:50.080 --> 24:51.547
Yes, but Ms. Lampard

24:51.590 --> 24:53.182
forwarded
the e-mail

24:53.220 --> 24:55.984
to her director of
human resources.

24:56.020 --> 24:58.523
Can you tell me
what that is there

24:58.560 --> 24:59.822
in the text
of this forwarding

24:59.860 --> 25:02.124
e-mail, Ms. Lampard?
That? A smiley face.

25:02.160 --> 25:04.196
_ _ An emoticon-- _
Signifying your satisfaction

25:04.230 --> 25:06.061
at having reached

25:06.100 --> 25:08.739
an agreement with
Mr. Edelstein.
Not necessarily.

25:08.770 --> 25:10.965
Isn't it true, Ms. Lampard,

25:11.010 --> 25:14.537
that many communications
in the tech industry

25:14.580 --> 25:16.571
contain emoticons?
No.

25:16.610 --> 25:19.738
Hmm. Then maybe you
can explain these.

25:19.780 --> 25:21.179
(taps hand on table)

25:21.220 --> 25:22.744
Smiley faces,

25:22.780 --> 25:24.281
winkies...

25:24.320 --> 25:26.242
Bronx cheers.

25:26.290 --> 25:28.554
LORAINNE:
In every case,
the emoticons illustrate

25:28.590 --> 25:30.820
your feelings about
a proposed deal.
We're gonna have

25:30.860 --> 25:32.919
to leave it there--
I'm being called away.

25:32.960 --> 25:34.257
Oh, really?
How convenient for you.

25:35.960 --> 25:38.326
Our life _has become
more interesting

25:38.370 --> 25:40.258
since Cary
was arrested.
Who is he?

25:40.300 --> 25:42.598
No idea, but
he has money.

25:42.640 --> 25:46.201
Mrs. Florrick, hi.
Ernie Nolan, Erco Properties.

25:46.240 --> 25:47.798
We met once
at a fund-raiser

25:47.840 --> 25:49.307
for your husband.
Oh, yes, of course.

25:49.340 --> 25:52.104
One of my clients has an office
in your building.

25:52.150 --> 25:53.299
It's a lovely space.

25:53.350 --> 25:54.715
Thank you, thank you.

25:54.750 --> 25:56.615
And may I say
that your offices

25:56.650 --> 25:58.811
are lovely, also.

25:58.850 --> 26:00.613
Well, we are a, um...

26:00.660 --> 26:02.218
work in progress.

26:02.260 --> 26:04.683
So, how can I help you today,
Mr. Nolan?

26:04.730 --> 26:05.754
Well, actually,

26:05.790 --> 26:07.348
maybe we can speak alone?

26:07.390 --> 26:11.360
Actually, Robyn is
my most valued confidant,

26:11.400 --> 26:12.992
50... no.

26:14.070 --> 26:16.061
Okay.

26:17.240 --> 26:18.730
I've heard about

26:18.770 --> 26:20.260
your partner's
troubles.

26:20.310 --> 26:21.629
Uh, Curtis Agos.

26:21.680 --> 26:22.635
Cary Agos.

26:22.680 --> 26:24.272
I want to loan the funds

26:24.310 --> 26:25.641
for his bail, interest-free.

26:25.680 --> 26:27.375
You...

26:27.410 --> 26:30.117
Why would you do that,
Mr. Nolan?
I think

26:30.150 --> 26:31.913
it's disgraceful how the
current state's attorney

26:31.950 --> 26:35.716
is behaving--
he's railroading your partner.

26:35.760 --> 26:38.285
So here's a cashier's
check for $1.3 million.

26:38.330 --> 26:40.321
Take it.

26:44.100 --> 26:46.989
Uh...

26:47.030 --> 26:49.089
I'm still confused.

26:49.140 --> 26:51.062
How well do you know

26:51.110 --> 26:53.772
my husband?
How well? Mm, not very.

26:53.810 --> 26:55.937
Why?
Did my husband
ask you to do this?

26:55.980 --> 26:57.299
No.

26:57.340 --> 26:59.308
Then I'm confused.

26:59.350 --> 27:01.978
I'm not a fan...

27:02.020 --> 27:04.215
of the current
state's attorney, ma'am.

27:04.250 --> 27:06.389
The way he's been
treating your partner,

27:06.420 --> 27:08.308
it's the same way
he's been treating

27:08.360 --> 27:09.918
the hardworking businessmen
of Chicago.

27:09.960 --> 27:12.349
And we need a change.

27:12.390 --> 27:14.858
I'm not running
for state's attorney, Mr. Nolan.

27:14.900 --> 27:17.255
I know.
But when you do announce...

27:17.300 --> 27:18.767
I'm not announcing.

27:18.800 --> 27:20.222
I'm never running.

27:20.270 --> 27:21.692
Ever. I'm not a politician.

27:21.740 --> 27:23.765
Right. Exactly.

27:23.810 --> 27:26.335
It was very nice
to meet you.

27:26.370 --> 27:28.338
And you.
We'll be in touch.

27:28.380 --> 27:30.109
No, we won't.

27:30.140 --> 27:31.107
Here you go.

27:31.150 --> 27:32.401
I'm...

27:32.450 --> 27:35.010
trying to be a friend,
Mrs. Florrick.

27:35.050 --> 27:36.369
I know.

27:36.420 --> 27:38.285
I have plenty of friends;
I don't need any more.

27:38.320 --> 27:40.345
You taking money
from Roderick Realty?

27:40.390 --> 27:43.757
Have a nice day.

27:50.400 --> 27:52.425
A-Am I a bad person?

27:52.470 --> 27:54.199
I mean, take the money.

27:54.240 --> 27:56.435
Take the check.
No. It's not free.

27:56.470 --> 27:58.461
What do you care?
He thinks you're running

27:58.510 --> 27:59.863
for state's attorney,
but you're not.

27:59.910 --> 28:02.037
So take the check.
You told him

28:02.080 --> 28:03.433
you're not running--
it's not corrupt.

28:03.480 --> 28:05.402
But he'll expect a quid pro quo.

28:05.450 --> 28:08.146
So? There isn't one.

28:08.180 --> 28:10.319
Unless you secretly
want to run.

28:10.350 --> 28:12.489
What?

28:12.520 --> 28:14.056
The only reason
to reject that check is

28:14.090 --> 28:15.717
if you think it'll
hurt your campaign.

28:15.760 --> 28:17.284
There is no campaign.

28:17.320 --> 28:19.049
I know, so take the check.

28:22.030 --> 28:24.169
Are you going to get it?

28:24.200 --> 28:26.191
*

28:28.170 --> 28:30.468
Don't ever use _
surrogates on me, Eli.

28:30.500 --> 28:33.879
Valerie Jarrett, she
doesn't just make it up

28:33.910 --> 28:36.231
in her mind
to suggest I run.

28:36.280 --> 28:37.872
You put her up to it.
I'm not running.

28:37.910 --> 28:40.845
I have no interest
in running.

28:40.880 --> 28:43.917
There's no wrong
I want corrected.

28:43.950 --> 28:46.510
There's no mountain
I want to climb.
That...

28:46.550 --> 28:48.814
So stop getting
people to call me

28:48.860 --> 28:51.852
and come to me with money--
I'm not changing my mind.
What?

28:51.890 --> 28:53.448
I'm...

28:53.490 --> 28:55.890
not... changing...
my mind.

28:55.930 --> 28:57.329
And if I took that money,

28:57.360 --> 28:59.419
it's corrupt!
Wait. What money?

28:59.470 --> 29:01.791
Ernie Nolan's money!

29:01.840 --> 29:04.400
Ernie Nolan from
Erco Properties...

29:04.440 --> 29:06.067
he offered you money?
Eli, stop it.

29:06.110 --> 29:08.408
I didn't talk to him.
I didn't say anything.

29:08.440 --> 29:12.308
I'm... not... running.

29:15.850 --> 29:18.011
(door closes)

29:18.050 --> 29:20.484
(quietly):
Wow. That's interesting.

29:22.820 --> 29:24.526
Something odd.

29:24.560 --> 29:26.778
I just saw Diane Lockhart's
preliminary witnesses

29:26.830 --> 29:28.422
for the Cary Agos trial.

29:28.460 --> 29:30.451
They listed two of
the crew members

29:30.500 --> 29:32.866
who were with Agos,
not all three.

29:32.900 --> 29:35.994
Who was the one they left off?
Trey.

29:36.040 --> 29:39.305
Our C.I.?
The one wearing the wire.
Yep.

29:42.910 --> 29:45.003
How did they know?

29:45.050 --> 29:46.540
I have no idea.

29:51.620 --> 29:53.542
DIANE:
Dean. Hello.

29:53.590 --> 29:55.353
Is everything
all right?

29:55.390 --> 29:58.553
I'd like to speak to you
about Florrick-Agos.

30:04.870 --> 30:08.067
I thought about what you said--
building from the ground up,

30:08.100 --> 30:09.863
starting new.

30:09.900 --> 30:12.368
All my life,
I've pursued the sure thing,

30:12.410 --> 30:14.970
the predictably obtainable.

30:15.010 --> 30:17.604
So it frightened me to think
about going after something new.

30:17.640 --> 30:20.404
It also excited me.

30:20.450 --> 30:21.917
You're coming?

30:21.950 --> 30:24.009
Yes.

30:24.050 --> 30:25.517
I'm so glad, Dean.

30:25.550 --> 30:27.518
It's not just me.

30:28.520 --> 30:30.556
They're coming, too.

30:35.460 --> 30:37.621
You're kidding.

30:37.660 --> 30:40.026
Wait. What?

30:40.070 --> 30:42.038
Cohen and Faber
from Corporate Transactional,

30:42.070 --> 30:43.492
Kay Sargeant from Tax,

30:43.540 --> 30:46.407
Kevin Meyers from M&A,
and Christie

30:46.440 --> 30:48.203
and Berger from
Trusts and Estates.

30:48.240 --> 30:49.605
Six department heads?

30:49.640 --> 30:52.040
Two of them David Lee protgs.

30:52.080 --> 30:54.173
Well, uh, where are we
gonna put them all?

30:54.220 --> 30:56.074
Well, that's a pretty
high-class problem.

30:56.120 --> 30:57.371
(vacuum whirring loudly)

31:00.220 --> 31:02.859
(clears throat)
Would you excuse us?

31:03.660 --> 31:06.288
Patric Edelstein,
CEO of Sleuthway.

31:06.330 --> 31:07.957
And an innocent man.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.649
(laughs)

31:09.700 --> 31:11.565
Thank you, Mr. Edelstein,
for answering questions.

31:11.600 --> 31:13.261
No problem.

31:13.300 --> 31:14.631
It helps that
you're suing me, too.

31:14.670 --> 31:17.195
(clears throat)
In your capacity as CEO,

31:17.240 --> 31:19.435
did you give a presentation

31:19.470 --> 31:21.472
at the Beaver Creek tech
conference last fall?

31:21.510 --> 31:23.432
I did.
Ms. Lampard

31:23.480 --> 31:25.107
approached you
afterwards,
didn't she?

31:25.150 --> 31:27.141
She did. She said she was in
complete agreement that costs

31:27.180 --> 31:29.114
were spiraling
out of control.
And did

31:29.150 --> 31:31.015
she propose a solution?
She suggested
a deal,

31:31.050 --> 31:33.610
that Sleuthway and Chumhum
would agree to hold the line

31:33.650 --> 31:36.619
on salaries and agree not to
poach one another's key people.
Really?

31:36.660 --> 31:38.548
And what
did you say?
Initially I agreed,

31:38.590 --> 31:40.990
but, I have to be honest,
I never intended

31:41.030 --> 31:43.396
to honor the agreement
and I never did.

31:43.430 --> 31:47.059
Ms. Lampard can be...
challenging to deal with.

31:47.100 --> 31:48.567
So I just told her
what she wanted to hear.

31:48.600 --> 31:50.238
But Ms. Lampard was serious
about this deal,

31:50.270 --> 31:53.501
wasn't s_he?
It certainly
seemed so to me.

31:53.540 --> 31:54.700
(sirens wailing)

31:54.740 --> 31:56.332
We have a problem.

31:56.380 --> 31:57.631
DIANE:
What kind of a problem?

31:57.680 --> 31:59.341
Jim Lenard.

31:59.380 --> 32:01.416
Oh, Bishop's man.
The one with the silver teeth?

32:01.450 --> 32:02.474
Yeah.

32:02.520 --> 32:03.942
And?

32:03.990 --> 32:05.582
He's dead.

32:06.620 --> 32:08.315
What?

32:08.360 --> 32:10.988
A-Any sense why?

32:11.030 --> 32:12.588
Bishop. He thought
Lenard was the CI.

32:12.630 --> 32:14.723
Damn.
Yep.

32:14.760 --> 32:17.649
He just killed one
of Cary's two witnesses.

32:17.700 --> 32:20.089
(horn honking)
(sirens wailing)

32:26.110 --> 32:28.271
(phone ringing)

32:31.380 --> 32:33.541
Mm. Hello?

32:33.580 --> 32:35.468
Yes, Mrs. Florrick,
it's Linda Keating

32:35.520 --> 32:37.317
from The Weekly Correspondent.

32:37.350 --> 32:38.612
Yes?

32:38.650 --> 32:40.447
I just wondered
if you had a quick reaction

32:40.490 --> 32:43.050
to the push poll script
that was leaked this morning.

32:43.090 --> 32:45.058
Excuse me? It's 7:00 am.

32:45.090 --> 32:47.320
Yes, I know. I need some quotes
for our online edition.

32:47.360 --> 32:50.295
Do you have any reaction to the
push poll about your candidacy?

32:50.330 --> 32:54.096
My... I don't have a candidacy.

32:54.140 --> 32:55.391
Is that a quote?

32:57.070 --> 32:58.264
I know. I got
the same call.

32:58.310 --> 32:59.561
It wasn't me, Alicia.
Eli.

32:59.610 --> 33:01.578
Why would I leak a
push poll like that?

33:01.610 --> 33:03.407
Have you read it?
Who else, Eli?

33:03.440 --> 33:05.579
Who else would poll
on my candidacy?

33:05.610 --> 33:08.408
Castro. Right now he's
a shoe-in for reelection.

33:08.450 --> 33:10.247
He's worried about you.
I don't believe you.

33:10.280 --> 33:11.542
Have you read the
polling questions?

33:11.590 --> 33:13.342
They make you look bad.

33:13.390 --> 33:15.255
"Do you think the wife
of a sitting governor

33:15.290 --> 33:18.350
should take advantage of her
position to run for office?"

33:18.390 --> 33:20.585
This is Castro, not me.
Don't you see?

33:20.630 --> 33:22.791
And I had
nothing to do

33:22.830 --> 33:24.798
with Ernie Nolan offering
you money. He did it

33:24.830 --> 33:27.765
on his own. Yes, I got
Valerie Jarrett to call you,

33:27.800 --> 33:30.360
but that was it. This
is just happening.

33:30.400 --> 33:31.560
Nothing just happens.

33:31.610 --> 33:33.566
Yes, it does.

33:33.610 --> 33:35.407
As cynical as I am,

33:35.440 --> 33:37.635
I know that sometimes
the world just takes over.

33:37.680 --> 33:39.648
People write letters,
kids stand in front of tanks,

33:39.680 --> 33:41.272
college students vote.

33:41.320 --> 33:44.209
And even this crook,
Nolan-- that's a good sign.

33:44.250 --> 33:46.343
I never trust when the
good guys support you.

33:46.390 --> 33:48.688
It's when the bad guys come
round, you know it's real.

33:48.720 --> 33:53.225
People think you're important
enough to bribe.

33:56.660 --> 33:59.220
Did the reporter tell
you the polling results?
I don't want to know.

33:59.270 --> 34:01.295
It backfired for Castro.

34:01.340 --> 34:04.662
74% viewed your candidacy
in a positive light,

34:04.710 --> 34:06.507
even with
his wording.
Stop, Eli.

34:06.540 --> 34:08.405
(elevator bell dings)

34:10.340 --> 34:11.739
Peter would kill
for those numbers.

34:11.780 --> 34:15.216
Any politician would.

34:15.250 --> 34:17.445
(sighs)

34:22.460 --> 34:23.609
(door opens)

34:23.660 --> 34:25.457
Mrs. Florrick.

34:25.490 --> 34:27.583
(door closes)
It's always a pleasure. Although

34:27.630 --> 34:29.359
if this is about your partner's
prosecution, you'll have

34:29.400 --> 34:31.265
to speak with Finn.
I'm not running, Mr. Castro.

34:31.300 --> 34:34.497
Okay. I don't know where
that came from

34:34.540 --> 34:37.338
but good to know.
Every dollar
you spend polling on me

34:37.370 --> 34:39.338
is a waste of a dollar.
I'm not running.

34:39.370 --> 34:40.860
I assure you,
I had nothing to do

34:40.910 --> 34:42.775
with that poll that was leaked
to the paper this morning.

34:42.810 --> 34:44.869
I'm far too focused on my own
campaign to worry about yours.

34:44.910 --> 34:47.299
There's no "mine."
I'm not running.

34:47.350 --> 34:48.544
Good.

34:48.580 --> 34:50.468
It wouldn't make much sense.

34:50.520 --> 34:52.488
Running while your partner
is going to jail for dealing.

34:52.520 --> 34:54.579
I'm not a threat to you.
Oh, I know.

34:54.620 --> 34:56.485
You may be polling at 74%,
but wait till they find out

34:56.520 --> 34:58.556
what your firm's been up to.

34:58.590 --> 35:00.524
I'm not running.

35:00.560 --> 35:02.528
(chuckles)

35:02.560 --> 35:04.164
Good.

35:04.200 --> 35:05.827
Then we have no disagreement.

35:06.870 --> 35:09.259
Why are you going after Cary?

35:11.570 --> 35:15.176
Drugs.

35:15.210 --> 35:16.575
Why do you think?

35:29.390 --> 35:31.858
Eli, did you see this?

35:31.890 --> 35:34.893
"Do you think
a prominent politician's wife

35:34.930 --> 35:36.557
"with no political credentials

35:36.600 --> 35:38.659
should run
for office?"
The push poll. I know.

35:38.700 --> 35:40.520
It sounds bad. But
look at the results.

35:40.570 --> 35:42.538
Get Castro on the line.
Why?

35:42.570 --> 35:44.561
Because I'm gonna tell him
if he keeps up with this crap,

35:44.610 --> 35:47.408
we're getting involved.
It wasn't Castro.

35:47.440 --> 35:50.238
It wasn't?
Well, who was it?
Okay,

35:50.280 --> 35:52.441
first of all, Alicia
should run. She just...
Stop.

35:52.480 --> 35:54.448
You're kidding.
She wasn't listening
to surrogates.

35:54.480 --> 35:56.311
I needed
to create enemy surrogates.

35:56.350 --> 35:57.942
Okay. Do what you have to do.

35:57.980 --> 36:00.517
But don't do this.

36:04.660 --> 36:07.788
You don't like Deena Lampard,
do you, Mr. Edelstein?

36:07.830 --> 36:09.593
Yes, I do.
In your last deposition,

36:09.630 --> 36:11.769
you said she
was... difficult

36:11.800 --> 36:14.337
to handle.
Yeah, but I meant in business.

36:14.370 --> 36:15.564
You don't hold

36:15.600 --> 36:16.532
a personal grudge

36:16.570 --> 36:17.867
against her?

36:17.900 --> 36:19.504
I'm not sure.
What do you mean?

36:19.540 --> 36:22.304
You and Ms. Lampard
used to date, didn't you?

36:22.340 --> 36:23.500
I need a moment

36:23.540 --> 36:24.871
with my lavwers.

36:26.350 --> 36:28.477
I never gave
you permission

36:28.520 --> 36:29.817
to go down this route,

36:29.850 --> 36:31.579
Mrs. Florrick.

36:31.620 --> 36:34.487
What do you think
Neil Gross would hate more?

36:34.520 --> 36:36.317
Finding out
that you and Edelstein dated

36:36.360 --> 36:39.557
or losing
this lawsuit?

36:42.530 --> 36:43.997
EDELSTEIN:
We used to date,
a few years ago.

36:44.030 --> 36:46.999
Until your archrival, Neil
Gross, stole her away from you.

36:47.030 --> 36:51.239
(chuckles)
I wouldn't characterize
it that way.

36:51.270 --> 36:54.376
You two were supposed to go away
together to Belize, weren't you?

36:54.410 --> 36:58.346
Here is an afﬁdavit
from a...

36:58.380 --> 36:59.904
Beave_r_Creek
partICIpant

36:59.950 --> 37:03.477
who said that you referred
to Deena as a lying bitch.

37:03.520 --> 37:06.341
I might have been... inelegant,

37:06.390 --> 37:09.279
but I thought her price-fixing
scheme was ridiculous.

37:09.320 --> 37:10.719
So ridiculous, in fact,
that you didn't think

37:10.760 --> 37:12.921
she would hold up
her side of the bargain.

37:12.960 --> 37:14.621
I mean, she was... she was
always flying off the
handle, saying things.

37:14.660 --> 37:17.424
So if you
didn't believe

37:17.460 --> 37:18.620
that Deena would do
what she said,

37:18.670 --> 37:20.467
then there was no agreement,

37:20.500 --> 37:22.468
was there?
What? What do you mean?

37:22.500 --> 37:26.504
An agreement requires an offer
and an acceptance to be valid.

37:26.540 --> 37:28.508
If you and the other
CEOs didn't believe

37:28.540 --> 37:30.929
that Deena would follow through
with her end of the deal,

37:30.980 --> 37:33.676
then there was never
a valid acceptance.

37:33.710 --> 37:35.519
EDELSTEIN:
Well, I mean...

37:35.550 --> 37:37.973
Actually, I can't be so certain

37:38.020 --> 37:39.988
what Deena would
do or not.

37:40.020 --> 37:42.887
Let's discuss.

37:48.860 --> 37:51.658
$5 million.
Four.

37:51.700 --> 37:54.931
They conspired to hold the line
on employee's pay.

37:54.970 --> 37:57.689
They fired anyone
who objected.
Prove it.

37:57.740 --> 37:59.708
$4.5.

37:59.740 --> 38:01.571
No. Four.

38:01.610 --> 38:03.009
I should've hired you.

38:03.040 --> 38:04.746
You're an assassin.

38:06.450 --> 38:08.611
Your mistake.

38:08.650 --> 38:10.618
(buzzer sounds)

38:10.650 --> 38:12.880
He's dead?
Yeah.

38:12.920 --> 38:14.888
Bishop's
tying up loose ends.

38:14.920 --> 38:17.718
He thought his enemy was Jim,
but it wasn't.

38:17.760 --> 38:20.479
Cary, we'll do our best, but
the loss of this witness hurts.

38:20.530 --> 38:21.622
Have you talked to Bishop?

38:21.660 --> 38:22.729
About?

38:22.760 --> 38:23.920
Make sure he doesn't kill

38:23.960 --> 38:25.359
the other good witness?
Yes.

38:27.600 --> 38:29.568
(indistinct chatter)

38:29.600 --> 38:32.763
Jim Lenard was the best witness
for Cary we had.

38:32.810 --> 38:34.698
The one whose testimony
was most likely

38:34.740 --> 38:36.731
to be favorable
to us in court.

38:36.780 --> 38:39.408
You're saying he wasn't
the one wearing the wire?

38:39.450 --> 38:41.418
No.

38:41.450 --> 38:44.908
I'm saying that we can't lose
another witness.

38:46.990 --> 38:48.116
Okay.

38:48.150 --> 38:50.357
Then tell me who Cary needs.

38:55.030 --> 38:57.999
You don't want both witnesses
to be unavailable,

38:58.030 --> 39:02.933
then tell me who Cary needs.

39:13.610 --> 39:15.339
All those in favor.

39:16.020 --> 39:17.669
Cary, what's your vote?

39:17.720 --> 39:19.517
Nay.

39:19.550 --> 39:20.744
That is...

39:20.790 --> 39:22.985
ten yeas and five nays.

39:23.020 --> 39:24.556
The motion passes.

39:24.590 --> 39:26.979
We are now Florrick,
Agos & Lockhart.

39:27.030 --> 39:29.021
(applause)

39:29.060 --> 39:30.425
And we're no longer
in debt.

39:30.460 --> 39:32.064
(whooping, excited chatter)

39:32.100 --> 39:35.035
(recorded):
This is the Cook County Jail's

39:35.070 --> 39:37.061
automated phone system.

39:37.100 --> 39:40.137
You have exceeded
the allotted time...

39:40.170 --> 39:42.479
(phone beeping)

39:43.610 --> 39:44.941
(beeping stops)

39:44.980 --> 39:46.709
We have one new
item of busmess.

39:46.750 --> 39:49.014
Chumhum has agreed
to an advance on our fees.

39:49.050 --> 39:51.041
It was Cary's case.

39:51.080 --> 39:54.083
I move _that we use it
to get him out on bail.
I second.

39:54.120 --> 39:55.712
Well, you can't second.
You're not a partner.

39:55.760 --> 39:59.059
I urge someone else to second.

40:02.930 --> 40:04.625
I second.

40:04.670 --> 40:07.924
All those in favor?

40:13.670 --> 40:16.639
Agos, get up.

40:16.680 --> 40:18.705
You made bail.

40:46.040 --> 40:47.837
*

41:14.840 --> 41:17.468
*

41:36.160 --> 41:38.754
(elevator bell dings)

41:52.810 --> 41:55.199
(quietly):
Good-bye.

42:09.690 --> 42:11.214
How you doing today, Gunter?

42:11.260 --> 42:13.979
That depends.

42:14.030 --> 42:15.588
Do you have hot water?

42:15.630 --> 42:17.029
I think so.

42:17.060 --> 42:18.869
Then I'm good.

42:18.900 --> 42:20.868
What about you?

42:20.900 --> 42:22.697
I don't know.

42:22.740 --> 42:26.164
The future's weird.

42:26.210 --> 42:29.702
9/11 was a plot.

42:34.780 --> 42:37.214
You look thin.

42:37.250 --> 42:38.683
Yeah. Diet. Fresh air.

42:38.720 --> 42:40.244
(chuckles)

42:40.290 --> 42:42.258
A lot of changes around here.

42:42.290 --> 42:44.258
Yeah.

42:44.290 --> 42:47.259
We missed you.

42:53.070 --> 42:55.231
This is the first time
we've done this,

42:55.270 --> 42:57.067
isn't it?
I think so.

42:57.100 --> 42:59.102
(both chuckle)
