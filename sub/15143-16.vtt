Anybody home?

Anybody?

00:23.750 --> 00:26.083
Okay, new Goldie.

00:23.750 --> 00:26.083
This is your home.

00:26.125 --> 00:27.834
Full disclosure:

00:27.875 --> 00:30.709
something bad did happen

00:27.875 --> 00:30.709
to the previous tenant.

00:34.834 --> 00:36.458
There we go.

00:36.500 --> 00:37.875
[kids chattering indistinctly]

00:41.083 --> 00:42.458
- Hi, Dad.

00:41.083 --> 00:42.458

00:45.000 --> 00:47.083
What's in your hand?

00:47.125 --> 00:49.250

00:52.792 --> 00:54.834
Nada.

00:54.875 --> 00:57.083
I'm sold.

00:57.125 --> 00:58.875
Let's see both hands.

Hey, Dad, jazz hands!

[screaming]

01:10.417 --> 01:11.917
Aah!

01:11.959 --> 01:13.792
Jazz hands!

01:11.959 --> 01:13.792
I always fall for jazz hands.

01:13.834 --> 01:14.959
- Goldie?

01:15.000 --> 01:17.625
- Uh, no.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.625
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:17.667 --> 01:19.792
This is Goldie.

01:20.709 --> 01:22.291
Why is he in a bag?

01:22.333 --> 01:25.625
I was just taking him

01:22.333 --> 01:25.625
for a walk.

01:25.667 --> 01:27.125
He likes to see the koi pond

01:25.667 --> 01:27.125
at the mall.

01:27.166 --> 01:28.667
Dad.

01:28.709 --> 01:30.458
Okay,<i> I</i> like to see

01:28.709 --> 01:30.458

Dad!

[sighs]

01:31.583 --> 01:33.834
Fine.

01:33.875 --> 01:35.500
Listen, sweetie,

01:33.875 --> 01:35.500
I have to tell you something.

01:35.542 --> 01:36.834
[clears throat]

01:38.333 --> 01:40.291
Goldie swam

01:38.333 --> 01:40.291
his last lap, kiddo.

01:40.333 --> 01:41.959
And I didn't want

01:40.333 --> 01:41.959
to upset you,

01:42.000 --> 01:44.500
so I was just trying to

01:42.000 --> 01:44.500
replace him before you got home.

01:44.542 --> 01:47.166
So Goldie's really gone?

01:47.208 --> 01:48.166
I forget.

01:48.208 --> 01:50.667
Is this Goldie #7

01:48.208 --> 01:50.667
or Goldie #8?

01:50.709 --> 01:53.750
W-w-wait. Goldie's been gone

01:50.709 --> 01:53.750
before?

01:53.792 --> 01:55.333
Seven times?

01:55.375 --> 01:56.834
Oh, right.

01:56.875 --> 01:58.959
We're not supposed

01:56.875 --> 01:58.959
to tell Dawn

01:59.000 --> 02:00.875
about all the fish

01:59.000 --> 02:00.875
that we flushed.

02:00.917 --> 02:03.000
- W-w-w-wait.

02:03.041 --> 02:05.333
You guys

02:03.041 --> 02:05.333
all knew about this?

02:05.375 --> 02:06.709
Since when?

02:06.750 --> 02:08.583
Since Goldie #3.

02:08.625 --> 02:10.333
Remember her?

02:10.375 --> 02:11.458
[all sighing]

02:13.250 --> 02:15.250
I cannot believe you guys.

02:15.291 --> 02:16.959
How could you keep this

02:15.291 --> 02:16.959
a secret from me?

02:18.583 --> 02:20.291
'Cause we didn't

02:18.583 --> 02:20.291
want you to feel bad.

02:20.333 --> 02:21.875
And now you feel bad.

02:21.917 --> 02:24.792
So we were right.

02:24.834 --> 02:26.834
At least we have Goldie #8,

02:24.834 --> 02:26.834
who'll live forever!

02:28.834 --> 02:29.875
Uh, Dad...

We've got a floater.

Whoa, whoa, wait.

to be models.

05:05.667 --> 05:07.000
Some of us.

05:07.041 --> 05:09.625
They're children's

05:09.667 --> 05:11.166
I'm just saying.

05:11.208 --> 05:12.917
I'm no stranger

05:11.208 --> 05:12.917
to the modeling game, man.

05:12.959 --> 05:15.792
You were a foot model, Tom.

05:15.834 --> 05:18.542
A "before" foot model.

05:18.583 --> 05:23.041
My toe fungus paid for the power

05:18.583 --> 05:23.041

05:23.083 --> 05:25.291

05:23.083 --> 05:25.291
to the catwalk.

05:25.333 --> 05:27.750
Check out my sizzle.

05:27.792 --> 05:30.208
Judging by that walk,

05:27.792 --> 05:30.208
I think his fungus is back.

05:32.166 --> 05:33.542

So...a goldfish

05:37.625 --> 05:39.834
Ooh, you forgot about

05:37.625 --> 05:39.834
the sundae bar.

05:41.333 --> 05:43.375
What happened to us?

05:43.417 --> 05:45.291
We never had secrets

05:43.417 --> 05:45.291
from each other.

05:45.333 --> 05:47.125
We used to have

05:45.333 --> 05:47.125
a circle of trust,

05:47.166 --> 05:51.291
but now that's broken.

05:51.333 --> 05:53.458

05:51.333 --> 05:53.458
is a quadfession session.

05:55.709 --> 05:57.458
What's a quadfession session?

06:03.542 --> 06:04.959
- All right, boys.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.625
The quadfession session

06:05.000 --> 06:08.625
has officially begun.

06:08.667 --> 06:11.083
Still don't know

06:08.667 --> 06:11.083
what it is.

06:11.125 --> 06:12.792
If we're going to

06:11.125 --> 06:12.792
trust each other

06:12.834 --> 06:15.667
we need to wipe the slate clean

06:12.834 --> 06:15.667
and start over.

06:15.709 --> 06:18.625
So we need to confess

06:15.709 --> 06:18.625
our deepest, darkest secrets.

06:18.667 --> 06:21.709
That'll make us even

06:18.667 --> 06:21.709
and rebuild the circle of trust.

06:21.750 --> 06:23.041
This is a waste of time.

06:23.083 --> 06:25.959
We don't keep secrets

06:23.083 --> 06:25.959
from each other.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.583
Oh, yeah?

06:27.625 --> 06:29.375
Every night at dinner,

06:27.625 --> 06:29.375
when you're not looking,

06:29.417 --> 06:31.208
Dicky takes a sip of your milk.

06:31.250 --> 06:34.917
But you know I don't like

06:31.250 --> 06:34.917
sharing glassware!

06:34.959 --> 06:38.709
And that's why he does it.

06:34.959 --> 06:38.709
He thinks it's funny.

06:38.750 --> 06:40.875
And it is.

06:40.917 --> 06:45.000
Yeah, well, Ricky, remember when

06:40.917 --> 06:45.000
you "lost" your lucky ruler?

06:45.041 --> 06:46.291
Leonardo Da Inchy?

06:46.333 --> 06:48.458
Well, he's not lost.

06:48.500 --> 06:50.792
- Dicky threw him away.

06:48.500 --> 06:50.792
- What?

06:50.834 --> 06:53.166
I tried to measure my tongue

06:50.834 --> 06:53.166
and threw up on it.

06:54.875 --> 06:58.458
Doesn't feel good to be lied to,

06:54.875 --> 06:58.458
does it, Ricky?

06:58.500 --> 06:59.458
No.

06:59.500 --> 07:01.041
That's why we need this.

07:01.083 --> 07:02.667
So don't hold back.

07:02.709 --> 07:06.959
What's said in the circle

07:02.709 --> 07:06.959
stays in the circle.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
Trust each other.

07:09.041 --> 07:10.792
Nicky, you're up.

07:14.625 --> 07:16.834
Okay...

07:16.875 --> 07:18.291
As you all know,

07:18.333 --> 07:20.208
I have a very deep

07:21.500 --> 07:24.125
Well, I store raisins

07:21.500 --> 07:24.125
in there.

07:24.166 --> 07:26.333
For what?

07:26.375 --> 07:29.083
It's a healthy snack

07:26.375 --> 07:29.083
for when I'm on the go.

07:29.125 --> 07:30.417
You have any in there now?

07:30.458 --> 07:32.208
I have three regulars

07:30.458 --> 07:32.208
and a golden.

07:32.250 --> 07:35.834
Sometimes I like to close

07:32.250 --> 07:35.834
my eyes and surprise myself.

07:35.875 --> 07:39.542
Come on, golden.

07:39.583 --> 07:40.458
Yes.

07:42.792 --> 07:45.375
Wow.

07:45.417 --> 07:47.333

07:55.959 --> 07:57.208
A what?

07:57.250 --> 07:59.792
When I'm stressed out,

07:57.250 --> 07:59.792
I knit.

07:59.834 --> 08:02.709
Grandma taught me and

07:59.834 --> 08:02.709
I've been doing it for years.

08:02.750 --> 08:05.291
So any time you see

08:02.750 --> 08:05.291
a sweater on the dog,

08:05.333 --> 08:07.917
it came from

08:05.333 --> 08:07.917
these very nervous hands.

08:11.291 --> 08:14.458
You got skills, bro.

08:14.500 --> 08:15.709
Okay, my turn.

08:20.375 --> 08:21.625
[exhales heavily]

08:21.667 --> 08:25.917
I still have

08:21.667 --> 08:25.917
an imaginary friend.

08:25.959 --> 08:29.333
His name is DJ.

08:25.959 --> 08:29.333
He's a DJ.

08:29.375 --> 08:31.041
And he plays oontzing music

08:29.375 --> 08:31.041
only Dicky can hear.

08:32.500 --> 08:34.333
That explains the headbobbing.

08:34.375 --> 08:35.333
And the fist pumping.

08:35.375 --> 08:37.917
And your math grade.

08:39.750 --> 08:42.667
Okay, Dawn, you're up.

08:42.709 --> 08:43.917
We all went.

08:43.959 --> 08:46.166
Okay.

08:46.208 --> 08:47.250
But you can't make fun of me.

08:47.291 --> 08:49.458
You're safe in the circle.

08:50.542 --> 08:52.250
[sighs]

08:50.542 --> 08:52.250
Okay.

08:52.291 --> 08:54.291
[exhaling heavily]

08:54.333 --> 08:56.166
Here we go.

08:56.208 --> 08:58.875
You guys know Mack?

08:58.917 --> 09:02.709
I know I said I only

08:58.917 --> 09:02.709
like him as a friend,

09:02.750 --> 09:07.458
but I think I might actually

09:02.750 --> 09:07.458
sorta like him-like him.

09:07.500 --> 09:09.250
Wow.

09:09.291 --> 09:11.208
That took a lot of guts.

09:11.250 --> 09:13.834
Yeah.

09:11.250 --> 09:13.834
Sure did.

09:13.875 --> 09:16.041
Please let us

09:13.875 --> 09:16.041
make fun of you, please.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.792
Fine.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.792
You've got five seconds.

09:18.834 --> 09:20.333
[singsong]

09:18.834 --> 09:20.333
all: Dawn loves Mack!

09:20.375 --> 09:22.333
Dawn loves Mack!

09:22.375 --> 09:23.667
Okay.

09:22.375 --> 09:23.667
Time's up.

09:23.709 --> 09:25.125
See?

09:25.166 --> 09:27.166
Our circle of trust

09:25.166 --> 09:27.166
has been restored.

09:27.208 --> 09:28.667
Hey!

09:28.709 --> 09:30.625
Starting now.

09:37.291 --> 09:39.083
[laughs]

09:39.125 --> 09:42.166
That may be the cutest little

09:39.125 --> 09:42.166
knit-hat I have ever seen.

09:42.208 --> 09:43.500
Where did you guys get it?

09:43.542 --> 09:45.458
Pet store.

09:45.500 --> 09:48.875
But it fits so perfectly.

09:48.917 --> 09:51.000
Almost like it was hand-knit

09:48.917 --> 09:51.000
just for his little bird head.

09:51.041 --> 09:53.667
It's a hat, Josie.

09:51.041 --> 09:53.667
Get over it.

09:53.709 --> 09:56.709
Hey, Nicky,

09:53.709 --> 09:56.709
I'm kinda hungry.

09:56.750 --> 09:58.750
You got any 'sins

09:56.750 --> 09:58.750
in your snack hole?

09:59.542 --> 10:02.750
Pack your own snack hole.

10:02.792 --> 10:05.458
That's cold, bro.

10:05.500 --> 10:07.333
You know I'm an outie.

10:07.375 --> 10:10.792
Best I can do is

10:07.375 --> 10:10.792
an onion ring.

10:10.834 --> 10:12.250
Honey, I know your clothes

10:10.834 --> 10:12.250
are for kids.

10:12.291 --> 10:13.917
- Because they are.

10:12.291 --> 10:13.917
- But before you rule me out--

10:13.959 --> 10:15.458
Already have.

10:13.959 --> 10:15.458
Hey, kids, come here!

10:15.500 --> 10:16.709
I need to measure you

10:15.500 --> 10:16.709
for the show.

10:18.166 --> 10:22.166
Hey, hey, check out

10:18.166 --> 10:22.166
some of my runway skills, huh?

10:22.208 --> 10:26.250
I give you Simon LeTom,

10:22.208 --> 10:26.250
because I'm...

10:26.291 --> 10:27.792
hungry like the wolf.

10:27.834 --> 10:30.000
[barking, howling]

10:30.041 --> 10:31.000
[screaming]

10:31.041 --> 10:33.792
[thudding]

10:33.834 --> 10:36.250
One of these days,

10:33.834 --> 10:36.250
he's actually going to be hurt.

10:36.291 --> 10:37.875
(Tom)

10:36.291 --> 10:37.875
It's today!

10:37.917 --> 10:39.500
Oh, oh!

10:43.417 --> 10:45.750
- Hey, Dawn.

10:43.417 --> 10:45.750
- Hey, Mack.

10:45.792 --> 10:47.542
Do you know what chapter

10:45.792 --> 10:47.542
Mr. Williams wanted us

10:47.583 --> 10:49.000
to read for tomorrow?

10:49.041 --> 10:53.542
[laughter]

10:53.583 --> 10:55.166
Are they laughing at us?

10:55.208 --> 10:58.542
all: Dawn loves Mack!

10:55.208 --> 10:58.542
Dawn loves Mack!

10:58.583 --> 11:00.583
That's funny.

11:00.625 --> 11:03.250
My name's Mack.

11:03.291 --> 11:04.959
Oh.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.709
Yeah.

11:07.750 --> 11:09.250
Well, catch you later.

11:19.834 --> 11:21.291
What are you doing?

11:21.333 --> 11:22.583
Enjoying our sweaters.

11:22.625 --> 11:24.083
I feel like

11:22.625 --> 11:24.083
a sea captain!

11:26.125 --> 11:28.250
I knitted those

11:26.125 --> 11:28.250
in confidence.

11:28.291 --> 11:30.500
They're not

11:28.291 --> 11:30.500
"out-and-about" sweaters.

11:30.542 --> 11:33.959
They're "relaxing at home in

11:30.542 --> 11:33.959
the circle of trust" sweaters.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.291
Dude, don't worry.

11:35.333 --> 11:37.000
Your secret is safe.

11:37.041 --> 11:39.500
No one's gonna break

11:37.041 --> 11:39.500
the circle of trust.

11:39.542 --> 11:42.542
All right, who broke

11:39.542 --> 11:42.542
the circle of trust?

11:42.583 --> 11:44.000
What are you talking about?

11:44.041 --> 11:46.250
One of you little

11:44.041 --> 11:46.250
sweater-wearing snitches

11:46.291 --> 11:49.041
told my secret and now everyone

11:46.291 --> 11:49.041
in the hallway's going...

11:49.083 --> 11:52.208
[whispers]

11:49.083 --> 11:52.208
"Dawn loves Mack."

11:49.083 --> 11:52.208
- I didn't say anything.

11:52.250 --> 11:54.125
- Me neither.

11:52.250 --> 11:54.125
- Wasn't me.

11:54.166 --> 11:56.792
Okay.

11:54.166 --> 11:56.792
So no one's gonna admit it?

11:56.834 --> 11:59.458
Well, unless someone

11:56.834 --> 11:59.458
tells me...

11:59.500 --> 12:02.709
You boys know

11:59.500 --> 12:02.709
what a text blast is?

12:02.750 --> 12:05.417
When you text

12:02.750 --> 12:05.417
on the toilet?

12:05.458 --> 12:07.208
No.

12:07.250 --> 12:11.333
It's when I text everyone

12:07.250 --> 12:11.333
in the school at the same time.

12:11.375 --> 12:13.500
"Attention, everyone.

12:13.542 --> 12:17.000
"Nicky Harper keeps raisins

12:13.542 --> 12:17.000
in his bellybutton."

12:17.041 --> 12:19.291
- "And eats them."

12:17.041 --> 12:19.291
- [gasps]

12:19.333 --> 12:22.291
"Dicky Harper's best friend

12:19.333 --> 12:22.291
is a DJ..."

12:22.333 --> 12:25.542
- "And is imaginary."

12:22.333 --> 12:25.542
- [gasps]

12:25.583 --> 12:29.125
"And Ricky Harper

12:25.583 --> 12:29.125
is a strong knotter."

12:29.166 --> 12:30.375
[gasps]

12:30.417 --> 12:31.166
Wait, that's not

12:30.417 --> 12:31.166
that bad.

12:31.208 --> 12:33.250
"Stress-knitter."

12:33.291 --> 12:34.792
Stupid autocorrect.

12:34.834 --> 12:35.667
[gasps]

12:35.709 --> 12:37.291
Okay.

12:37.333 --> 12:38.667
Thumb's on send.

12:38.709 --> 12:40.417
Last chance to admit

12:38.709 --> 12:40.417
who did it.

12:40.458 --> 12:41.625
Dawn, please don't.

12:41.667 --> 12:43.417
Whoever did it, fess up.

12:43.458 --> 12:45.709
- It wasn't me.

12:43.458 --> 12:45.709
- Me either.

12:45.750 --> 12:48.458
All right.

12:45.750 --> 12:48.458
You made your choice.

12:48.500 --> 12:49.458
- In 3, 2--

12:48.500 --> 12:49.458
all: No!

12:49.500 --> 12:51.792
[phone chimes]

12:51.834 --> 12:53.917
[phones chiming]

12:53.959 --> 12:56.041
[laughter]

12:58.333 --> 13:00.125
Dude, how 'bout knitting up

13:00.166 --> 13:03.041
a little raisin pouch

13:00.166 --> 13:03.041
for your bro?

13:03.083 --> 13:05.625
Oontz, oontz, oontz.

13:07.750 --> 13:10.291
What have you done?

13:10.333 --> 13:12.709
I never want to knit again.

13:12.750 --> 13:15.792
And yet I need

13:12.750 --> 13:15.792
to knit so badly.

13:15.834 --> 13:17.291
And in case you're wondering,

13:17.333 --> 13:19.625
DJ the DJ is playing

13:17.333 --> 13:19.625
a very sad song.

13:19.667 --> 13:21.834
[sadly]

13:19.667 --> 13:21.834
Oontz...

13:21.875 --> 13:23.417
Oontz...

13:23.458 --> 13:24.250
[choking up]

13:23.458 --> 13:24.250
Oontz.

13:25.875 --> 13:29.333
Now you know how I feel.

13:36.166 --> 13:39.625
What is a four-letter word for

13:36.166 --> 13:39.625
a baseball pitcher's error?

13:39.667 --> 13:41.542
[squawks]

13:39.667 --> 13:41.542
Ball.

13:41.583 --> 13:44.291
Ah, nice.

13:44.333 --> 13:46.917
Hey, the fashion show is

13:44.333 --> 13:46.917
coming together, Tom.

13:46.959 --> 13:48.291
This could be, like,

13:46.959 --> 13:48.291
really big for the store.

13:48.333 --> 13:51.375
Turn that "could" into "will"

13:51.417 --> 13:54.500
with "America's Next Tom Model."

13:59.166 --> 14:02.083
Hey, Mike, will you tell Tom

13:59.166 --> 14:02.083
he's not a model?

14:02.125 --> 14:04.709
[squawks]

14:02.125 --> 14:04.709
Not a model, not a model.

14:04.750 --> 14:07.417
But I do need an emcee

14:04.750 --> 14:07.417
for the show!

14:07.458 --> 14:10.834
- Mike...

14:07.458 --> 14:10.834
- [chirps]

14:10.875 --> 14:12.375
Tell her I'm in.

14:12.417 --> 14:13.959
[squawks]

14:12.417 --> 14:13.959
I'm in.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.291
Excuse us, Mike.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.208
Just me, right?

14:20.250 --> 14:22.125
Come help me get the clothing

14:20.250 --> 14:22.125
racks out of the garage.

14:22.166 --> 14:23.750
- Yes, I'm in.

14:22.166 --> 14:23.750
- Leave the bird.

14:23.792 --> 14:25.291
Pretty lady, pretty lady.

14:25.333 --> 14:28.458
- I know that's you, Tom.

14:25.333 --> 14:28.458
- [groans]

14:28.500 --> 14:31.458
Dawn, I can't believe

14:28.500 --> 14:31.458
you text blasted our secrets.

14:31.500 --> 14:34.250
Yeah, the whole school

14:31.500 --> 14:34.250
is laughing at us.

14:34.291 --> 14:38.792
When you break the circle,

14:34.291 --> 14:38.792
you get treated like a jerkle.

14:40.834 --> 14:43.542
Mike, you would not

14:40.834 --> 14:43.542
believe my day.

14:43.583 --> 14:45.667
Thanks to one of

14:43.583 --> 14:45.667
my blabbermouth brothers,

14:45.709 --> 14:47.417
everyone at school

14:45.709 --> 14:47.417
now knows that--

14:47.458 --> 14:49.125
[singsong]

14:47.458 --> 14:49.125
Dawn loves Mack.

14:49.166 --> 14:50.083
Exactly!

14:50.125 --> 14:51.250
Wait, what?

14:51.291 --> 14:53.500
[squawks]

14:51.291 --> 14:53.500
Dawn loves Mack.

14:53.542 --> 14:56.083
(Mike)

14:53.542 --> 14:56.083
Dawn loves Mack.

14:57.667 --> 15:02.709
all: [singsong]

14:57.667 --> 15:02.709
Dawn loves Mack.

15:02.750 --> 15:04.375
Oh, no.

15:04.417 --> 15:06.709
And you were in the store

15:04.417 --> 15:06.709
with the kids from school.

15:06.750 --> 15:09.458
It was you!

15:06.750 --> 15:09.458
You're the blabberbeak!

15:09.500 --> 15:11.166
[boys yelling

15:09.500 --> 15:11.166
in the next room]

15:11.208 --> 15:13.667
[groans]

15:11.208 --> 15:13.667
They're mad at me.

15:13.709 --> 15:15.917
But I'll just explain it to them

15:13.709 --> 15:15.917
and they'll understand.

15:15.959 --> 15:18.667
Mm-hmm.

15:18.709 --> 15:21.083
Circle of trust, she said.

15:21.125 --> 15:23.417
Quadfession session, she said.

15:23.458 --> 15:26.333
And now I've dropped a stitch!

15:26.375 --> 15:28.500
I can't believe this.

15:28.542 --> 15:30.750
Now everyone's

15:28.542 --> 15:30.750
gonna think I'm weird.

15:31.834 --> 15:35.417
And on top of that,

15:31.834 --> 15:35.417
I'm out of raisins!

15:35.458 --> 15:37.500
- This is all Dawn's fault.

15:35.458 --> 15:37.500
- Yeah!

15:37.542 --> 15:40.041
You know what?

15:37.542 --> 15:40.041
Now that I think about it,

15:40.083 --> 15:41.792
maybe it's not!

15:40.083 --> 15:41.792
- Yeah!

15:41.834 --> 15:43.291
Wait, what?

15:43.333 --> 15:46.041
Dawn's the one who brought us

15:43.333 --> 15:46.041
together.

15:46.083 --> 15:48.375
She's the one who tried to fix

15:46.083 --> 15:48.375
the circle of trust.

15:48.417 --> 15:50.000
And everything was good,

15:50.041 --> 15:52.959
till one of you two jerkles

15:50.041 --> 15:52.959
broke it!

15:53.000 --> 15:54.375
You mean one of you two jerkles!

15:54.417 --> 15:57.709
No, one of you two jerkles!

15:57.750 --> 16:01.625
Well, whichever jerkle broke

15:57.750 --> 16:01.625
the circle is out of the quads!

16:01.667 --> 16:02.542
[all snarling]

16:07.250 --> 16:09.583
Yeah, I'm not so sure

16:07.250 --> 16:09.583

16:19.125 --> 16:20.709
This is so exciting, Tom.

16:20.750 --> 16:22.291
I am so proud of you.

16:20.750 --> 16:22.291
Break a leg.

16:22.333 --> 16:23.041
You too.

16:22.333 --> 16:23.041
Ooh!

[clears throat]

16:28.125 --> 16:30.834
Welcome aboard, fashion-gers.

16:30.875 --> 16:33.250
This is your pilot speaking.

16:33.291 --> 16:35.500
So go ahead and fashion

16:33.291 --> 16:35.500
your seat belts

16:35.542 --> 16:39.208
because HarperArmor

16:35.542 --> 16:39.208
is about to take off!

16:40.333 --> 16:41.917
What are you doing?

16:41.959 --> 16:43.542
I'm just trying to

16:41.959 --> 16:43.542
find my fashion show voice.

16:43.583 --> 16:45.542
Now?

16:43.583 --> 16:45.542
Right before the show?

16:45.583 --> 16:47.375
Up on that catwalk,

16:45.583 --> 16:47.375
I know who I am.

16:47.417 --> 16:48.834
Down here, I'm just a guy

16:47.417 --> 16:48.834
with a microphone.

16:48.875 --> 16:50.542
Okay.

16:48.875 --> 16:50.542
Okay, okay.

16:50.583 --> 16:52.625
Hey, pull yourself together,

16:50.583 --> 16:52.625
Tom.

16:52.667 --> 16:54.291
[in a German accent]

16:52.667 --> 16:54.291
How about I try

16:52.667 --> 16:54.291
a German accent?

16:54.333 --> 16:57.000
No!

16:54.333 --> 16:57.000
No accents.

16:57.041 --> 16:58.625
Ugh, this is my show.

16:58.667 --> 17:01.125
Okay, Josie, two minute warning.

17:01.166 --> 17:03.208
Copy that, Mrs. Harper.

17:03.250 --> 17:05.750
Um, what's up

17:03.250 --> 17:05.750

[growling and grunting]

17:06.959 --> 17:08.709
Nothing!

17:08.750 --> 17:10.625
Like all supermodels,

17:08.750 --> 17:10.625
they're just hungry.

17:12.417 --> 17:13.917
I hope that's all that is,

17:13.959 --> 17:16.250
'cause your Mom put

17:13.959 --> 17:16.250
a lot of work into this show.

17:19.166 --> 17:21.333
Hey, fellas.

17:21.375 --> 17:24.083
Look what I've got.

17:24.125 --> 17:29.000
It's a circle of crust.

17:29.041 --> 17:32.750
So let's stop fighting

17:29.041 --> 17:32.750

17:49.125 --> 17:51.250
- Move up.

17:49.125 --> 17:51.250
They're about to start.

17:51.291 --> 17:52.250
Don't poke me.

17:52.291 --> 17:55.333
That's not poking.

17:52.291 --> 17:55.333
This is poking.

17:55.375 --> 17:56.500
Oh, you want to poke.

17:56.542 --> 17:58.667
Hey!

17:56.542 --> 17:58.667
Why do I get poked?

[grunts]

17:59.875 --> 18:01.375
- Hey, guys!

18:01.417 --> 18:04.709
I thought maybe we could

18:01.417 --> 18:04.709
start all over again.

18:04.750 --> 18:06.667
I have a quadfession to make.

18:06.709 --> 18:11.250
So...look what I brought!

18:11.291 --> 18:12.458

18:12.500 --> 18:14.500
Great idea!

18:14.542 --> 18:17.125
[gong reverberates loudly]

18:17.166 --> 18:20.709
[laughter]

18:20.750 --> 18:23.625
First up,

18:20.750 --> 18:23.625
we have Dicky Harper.

18:23.667 --> 18:26.166
Dicky's ensemble works

18:23.667 --> 18:26.166
just as well on the field

18:26.208 --> 18:28.500
as it does in the classroom.

18:28.542 --> 18:32.875
That's classic HarperArmor

18:28.542 --> 18:32.875
versatility.

18:32.917 --> 18:37.542
Next we have Ricky Harper,

18:32.917 --> 18:37.542
dressed in sporting casual wear.

18:37.583 --> 18:40.834
Ricky's ready to go

18:37.583 --> 18:40.834
from athlete to mathlete.

18:40.875 --> 18:42.291
And since it's water resistant,

18:42.333 --> 18:44.166
he could also be a bath-lete.

18:44.208 --> 18:47.709
Whatever Ricky chooses,

18:44.208 --> 18:47.709
this outfit is an A+.

18:50.750 --> 18:53.792
And now let's bring out

18:50.750 --> 18:53.792
Nicky Harper.

18:53.834 --> 18:55.625
Ooh!

18:55.667 --> 18:57.834
In this casual skater look,

18:57.875 --> 19:00.375
Nicky is ready

18:57.875 --> 19:00.375
to hit the halfpipe...

19:00.417 --> 19:02.500
And not his brother.

19:02.542 --> 19:06.500
(Anne)

19:02.542 --> 19:06.500
See, folks, this is

19:02.542 --> 19:06.500
where style meets function

19:06.542 --> 19:08.792
at the HarperArmor junction.

19:10.375 --> 19:12.333
Guys, listen,

19:10.375 --> 19:12.333
I have to tell you something.

19:12.375 --> 19:14.208
Not now, Dawn.

19:14.250 --> 19:17.750
And now, one last time,

19:14.250 --> 19:17.750
HarperArmor for him.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.083
I'm first.

19:20.125 --> 19:21.542
[grunting]

19:20.125 --> 19:21.542
I'm first. Trust me.

19:21.583 --> 19:22.709
I don't trust you.

19:22.750 --> 19:23.625
I don't trust

19:22.750 --> 19:23.625
either of you.

19:23.667 --> 19:27.166
What are they doing?

19:28.542 --> 19:30.125
- No!

19:28.542 --> 19:30.125
- What is she doing?

19:33.750 --> 19:36.083
Don't be alarmed, folks.

19:36.125 --> 19:38.041
(Anne)

19:36.125 --> 19:38.041
This is just a demonstration

19:38.083 --> 19:41.792
to show just how durable

19:38.083 --> 19:41.792
HarperArmor is.

19:41.834 --> 19:43.834
Man, that stuff's a-durable.

19:43.875 --> 19:45.458
[cheers and applause]

19:45.500 --> 19:46.709
Please!

19:46.750 --> 19:49.709
Guys, please stop fighting.

19:49.750 --> 19:50.875
You're interrupting

19:49.750 --> 19:50.875
our triangle of hate.

19:50.917 --> 19:53.750
It's like

19:50.917 --> 19:53.750
the circle of trust,

19:53.792 --> 19:56.125
but it can jab you

19:53.792 --> 19:56.125
from all three sides.

19:56.166 --> 19:58.917
I was the one who broke

19:56.166 --> 19:58.917
the circle of trust!

20:00.542 --> 20:02.250
You're the jerkle?

20:02.291 --> 20:04.125
Yes, I'm the jerkle.

20:04.166 --> 20:06.417
all: Huh.

20:06.458 --> 20:08.625
Get her!

20:09.500 --> 20:10.875
Now what do I do?

20:10.917 --> 20:12.875
All my models are gone.

20:12.917 --> 20:15.542
Not all of them.

20:15.583 --> 20:18.709
You get out there

20:15.583 --> 20:18.709
and show them your sizzle.

20:25.166 --> 20:28.417
As you can see, HarperArmor

20:25.166 --> 20:28.417
is so versatile

20:28.458 --> 20:30.750
that even a grown man can fit

20:28.458 --> 20:30.750
into a boy's size medium.

20:30.792 --> 20:33.375
It's a small.

20:33.417 --> 20:34.959
[cheers and applause]

20:35.000 --> 20:37.625
So it was you who broke

20:35.000 --> 20:37.625
the circle of trust?

20:37.667 --> 20:39.834
Yes.

20:37.667 --> 20:39.834

20:42.417 --> 20:45.417
he's right.

20:45.458 --> 20:48.375
Mike told everybody about Mack,

20:45.458 --> 20:48.375
but I didn't know it

20:48.417 --> 20:51.125
until after I text blasted

20:48.417 --> 20:51.125
your secrets.

20:51.166 --> 20:52.917
I should've trusted you.

20:51.166 --> 20:52.917
I'm sorry.

20:54.792 --> 20:56.625
Doesn't matter.

20:54.792 --> 20:56.625
The damage is done.

Our secrets are out there

20:56.667 --> 21:00.542
running wild.

21:00.583 --> 21:02.959
Not for long.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.291
What are you doing?

21:04.333 --> 21:07.667
A text blast got us

21:04.333 --> 21:07.667
into this, so...

21:07.709 --> 21:09.542
maybe one will get us out.
