WEBVTT

00:02.503 --> 00:04.255
My name is Rose Tyler.

00:04.630 --> 00:06.758
And this is the story of Torchwood

00:07.299 --> 00:09.267
The last story I'll ever tell.

00:13.430 --> 00:16.354
Here we are, then. Dad, say hello to Rose.

00:16.433 --> 00:17.525
Hasn't she grown?

00:18.685 --> 00:21.359
Welcome to Torchwood.

00:22.689 --> 00:23.906
They're Cybermen.

00:24.942 --> 00:26.694
All of the ghosts are Cybermen.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.828
- That's not Cybermen.
- Oh, my God!

00:28.946 --> 00:32.450
Exterminate! Exterminate!

00:33.992 --> 00:36.290
This is the story of howl died.

01:15.492 --> 01:17.961
Exterminate.

01:18.078 --> 01:19.580
Daleks!

01:21.665 --> 01:23.338
You're called Daleks!

01:29.256 --> 01:31.054
I know your name.

01:31.133 --> 01:33.261
Think about it, how can I know that?

01:33.844 --> 01:37.018
A human who knows about the Daleks

01:38.181 --> 01:39.182
and the Time War.

01:40.684 --> 01:44.063
If you want to know how, then keep us alive.
That's all I'm asking.

01:44.187 --> 01:45.439
Me and my friends.

01:45.522 --> 01:49.117
- Yeah, Daleks, Time War, me, too.
- Yeah, and me.

01:50.861 --> 01:53.580
You will be necessary.

01:54.364 --> 01:57.743
Report! What is the status
of the Genesis Ark?

01:57.868 --> 02:00.246
Status hibernation.

02:00.495 --> 02:02.293
Commence awakening.

02:02.372 --> 02:06.843
The Genesis Ark must be
protected above all else.

02:09.420 --> 02:11.389
The Daleks? You said they were all dead.

02:12.299 --> 02:14.393
Never mind that. What the
hell's a "Genesis Ark"?

02:14.509 --> 02:15.601
What's down there?

02:17.512 --> 02:19.731
She was in that room, with the Sphere.

02:20.265 --> 02:22.939
- What's happened to Rose?
- I don't know.

02:26.855 --> 02:27.902
I'll find her.

02:28.565 --> 02:31.159
I brought you here. I'll get you
both out, you and your daughter.

02:31.234 --> 02:32.611
Jackie, look at me.

02:32.736 --> 02:33.737
Look at me!

02:35.322 --> 02:36.494
I promise you.

02:37.574 --> 02:38.917
I give you my word.

02:41.787 --> 02:45.212
You will talk to your
Central World Authority

02:45.290 --> 02:47.918
and order global surrender.

02:48.043 --> 02:49.420
Oh, do some research.

02:49.586 --> 02:52.339
We haven't got a "Central World Authority".

02:52.506 --> 02:53.928
You have now.

02:54.049 --> 02:57.679
I will speak on all global wavelengths.

02:58.762 --> 03:01.811
This broadcast is for humankind.

03:02.265 --> 03:07.066
The Cybermen now occupy
every landmass on this planet.

03:07.562 --> 03:09.815
<i>But you need not fear.</i>

03:10.440 --> 03:12.943
Cybermen will remove fear.

03:13.110 --> 03:18.287
<i>Cybermen will remove sex and class
and colour and creed.</i>

03:18.949 --> 03:21.418
You will become identical.

03:21.743 --> 03:24.337
You will become like us.

03:31.378 --> 03:32.595
Attack!

03:50.272 --> 03:52.650
I ordered surrender.

03:52.941 --> 03:55.285
They're not taking instructions.

03:55.652 --> 03:57.245
Don't you understand?
You're on every street!

03:57.320 --> 03:59.789
You're in their homes!
You've got their children!

03:59.865 --> 04:01.367
Of course they're going to fight!

04:01.783 --> 04:03.911
Which of you is least important?

04:04.119 --> 04:05.541
What's that supposed to mean?

04:05.620 --> 04:07.714
Which of you is least important?

04:07.831 --> 04:10.209
No. We don't work like that. None of us.

04:10.417 --> 04:12.670
Designate the least important.

04:12.919 --> 04:15.388
- This is my responsibility.
- No, don't...

04:17.007 --> 04:18.259
I, er...

04:18.341 --> 04:21.515
I represent the Torchwood Institute.
Anything you need,

04:22.095 --> 04:23.142
you come through me.

04:23.555 --> 04:24.681
Leave these two alone.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.483
You will kneel.

04:26.808 --> 04:28.981
- What for?
- Kneel!

04:33.523 --> 04:37.994
The Daleks need information
about current Earth history.

04:38.236 --> 04:40.596
Yeah, well, I can give you
a certain amount of intelligence,

04:40.739 --> 04:42.366
but nothing that will compromise
homeland security...

04:42.449 --> 04:44.497
Speech is not necessary.

04:44.576 --> 04:47.455
We will extract brainwaves.

04:52.042 --> 04:54.636
Don't. I'll tell you everything you need.

04:54.711 --> 04:55.883
No, don't.

05:03.678 --> 05:08.104
Scans detect unknown technology
active within Sphere Chamber.

05:08.600 --> 05:11.194
Cybermen will investigate.

05:11.561 --> 05:16.658
Units 70-6-5 and 70-6-6
will investigate Sphere Chamber.

05:18.360 --> 05:19.782
We obey.

05:20.695 --> 05:24.916
His mind spoke of
a second species invading Earth.

05:24.991 --> 05:28.165
Infected by the superstition of ghosts.

05:28.245 --> 05:29.918
You didn't need to kill him!

05:30.038 --> 05:33.087
Neither did we need him alive!

05:33.583 --> 05:36.507
Dalek Thay, investigate outside.

05:36.586 --> 05:38.259
I obey.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.724
Units, open visual link.

05:54.896 --> 05:56.990
<i>Visual contact established</i>

05:57.107 --> 05:59.030
Establish visual contact,

05:59.109 --> 06:01.532
lower communications barrier.

06:14.791 --> 06:16.885
Identify yourselves.

06:17.043 --> 06:19.842
You will identify first.

06:20.005 --> 06:22.428
State your identity!

06:22.549 --> 06:25.018
You will identify first.

06:25.093 --> 06:26.595
Identify!

06:26.678 --> 06:28.726
It's like Stephen Hawking
meets the speaking clock.

06:28.805 --> 06:31.809
And illogical, you will modify.

06:31.975 --> 06:34.899
Daleks do not take orders.

06:35.103 --> 06:38.073
You have identified as Daleks.

06:38.148 --> 06:41.493
Outline resembles the inferior species

06:41.610 --> 06:43.612
known as Cybermen.

06:44.738 --> 06:46.706
Rose said about the Daleks,

06:46.781 --> 06:48.533
she was terrified of them.

06:49.826 --> 06:51.999
What have they done to her, Doctor?
Is she dead?

06:52.078 --> 06:53.170
- Phone.
- What?

06:53.288 --> 06:54.585
Phone.

07:02.672 --> 07:06.552
Crude cybernetic constructs
on worldwide scale.

07:06.843 --> 07:10.097
She's answered. She's alive.
But why haven't they killed her?

07:10.180 --> 07:12.683
- Well, don't complain.
- They must need her for something.

07:13.016 --> 07:15.815
We must protect the Genesis Ark.

07:16.102 --> 07:17.228
"Genesis Ark"?

07:18.063 --> 07:22.739
Our species are similar,
though your design is inelegant

07:22.859 --> 07:26.580
Daleks have no concept of elegance.

07:26.696 --> 07:28.698
This is obvious.

07:28.907 --> 07:32.411
But consider. Our
technologies are compatible.

07:32.619 --> 07:34.621
Cybermen plus Daleks,

07:34.788 --> 07:38.213
together we could upgrade the universe.

07:38.541 --> 07:41.215
You propose an alliance?

07:41.503 --> 07:43.221
This is correct.

07:43.588 --> 07:45.682
Request denied.

07:47.509 --> 07:50.228
Hostile elements will be deleted.

07:52.222 --> 07:54.475
Exterminate.

07:58.728 --> 08:00.822
<i>Open visual link.</i>

08:01.690 --> 08:03.192
Daleks be warned.

08:03.274 --> 08:07.245
You have declared war upon the Cybermen.

08:07.737 --> 08:11.662
This is not war. This is pest control.

08:11.741 --> 08:14.540
We have five million Cybermen.

08:14.619 --> 08:16.496
How many are you?

08:16.913 --> 08:18.130
Four.

08:18.665 --> 08:22.795
You would destroy the
Cybermen with four Daleks?

08:23.044 --> 08:26.765
<i>We would destroy the
Cybermen with one Dale-k.</i>

08:27.257 --> 08:31.353
You are super/or in only one respect.

08:31.428 --> 08:32.929
What is that?

08:33.096 --> 08:36.020
<i>You are better at dying.</i>

08:36.265 --> 08:39.190
Raise communications barrier.

08:39.686 --> 08:40.812
Wail'.

08:40.895 --> 08:41.942
Lost her.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.275
Rewind image by nine rels.

08:44.357 --> 08:46.951
Identify grid Seven Gamma Flame.

08:48.361 --> 08:51.205
This male registers as enemy.

08:51.322 --> 08:55.122
- This female's heartbeat has increased.
- Yeah, tell me about it.

08:55.452 --> 08:58.422
- Identify him!
- All right, then.

08:59.581 --> 09:00.662
If you really want to know.

09:01.791 --> 09:02.917
That's the Doctor.

09:05.128 --> 09:07.472
Five million Cybermen, easy.

09:08.173 --> 09:11.473
One Doctor? Now you're scared.

09:13.053 --> 09:17.604
Quarantine the Sphere Chamber.
Start emergency upgrading.

09:17.682 --> 09:19.650
Begin with these personnel.

09:21.978 --> 09:25.778
No, you can't do this! We've surrendered!
We've surrendered!

09:25.899 --> 09:27.025
Keep this one.

09:27.150 --> 09:32.498
His increased adrenaline suggests
that he has vital Dalek information.

09:32.614 --> 09:35.493
- Stop them! I don't want to go! Doctor!
- I demand you leave that woman alone.

09:35.575 --> 09:38.216
- You promised me. You gave me your word.
- I won't help you unless

09:38.286 --> 09:40.447
you leave that woman alone.
Jackie, don't fight them...

09:40.455 --> 09:45.131
Cyberthreat irrelevant.
Concentrate on the Genesis Ark.

09:50.757 --> 09:52.555
Why are we being kept alive?

09:55.386 --> 09:57.013
- They might need me.
- What?

09:58.932 --> 10:00.104
What is it?

10:05.188 --> 10:06.610
What happens in there?

10:06.689 --> 10:09.033
What's upgrading mean? What do they do?

10:09.943 --> 10:12.196
I think they remove the brain.

10:12.946 --> 10:16.246
Sorry. I think they remove the brain

10:16.574 --> 10:18.167
and they put it into a suit of armour.

10:19.702 --> 10:21.329
That's what these things are.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.375
- They' re us.
- Next.

10:24.874 --> 10:28.629
This is your fault. You and your Torchwood!

10:28.711 --> 10:30.384
You've killed us all!

10:30.630 --> 10:33.759
I did my duty. For Queen and Country.

10:36.052 --> 10:37.395
I did my duty.

10:38.388 --> 10:39.640
I did my duty.

10:40.557 --> 10:42.480
Oh, God.

10:42.559 --> 10:43.981
I did my duty.

10:49.941 --> 10:52.785
- You are proof'.
- Of what?

10:53.695 --> 10:56.574
That emotions destroy you.

10:57.240 --> 10:58.457
Yeah, I am.

11:01.202 --> 11:03.705
Mind you, I quite like hope.

11:04.330 --> 11:06.253
Hope's a good emotion.

11:06.875 --> 11:08.422
And here it comes.

11:20.930 --> 11:23.103
Doctor. Good to see you again.

11:26.853 --> 11:27.979
Jake?

11:28.062 --> 11:30.781
The Cybermen came through
from one world to another,

11:31.107 --> 11:32.108
and so did we.

11:34.444 --> 11:35.616
No!

11:38.364 --> 11:41.538
Cyberleader One has been terminated

11:41.868 --> 11:44.917
Explain. Download shared files.

11:47.916 --> 11:51.295
I will be upgraded to Cyberleader.

12:01.554 --> 12:02.976
Defend this room.

12:03.056 --> 12:04.729
Chrissie, monitor communications.

12:04.807 --> 12:07.731
Kill one Cyberleader
and they just download into another.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.153
Move!

12:11.231 --> 12:15.452
You can't just hop from one
world to another. You can't.

12:15.944 --> 12:18.788
We just did. With these.

12:21.157 --> 12:23.455
But that's impossible.
You can't have this sort of technology.

12:23.534 --> 12:26.378
We've got our own version of Torchwood.
They developed it.

12:27.789 --> 12:28.881
Do you wanna come and see?

12:29.999 --> 12:31.251
No!

12:36.631 --> 12:38.554
Parallel Earth,

12:38.633 --> 12:40.135
parallel Torchwood.

12:41.010 --> 12:43.229
Except we found out what
the Institute was doing,

12:43.346 --> 12:45.269
and the People's Republic took control.

12:45.348 --> 12:47.771
I've got to get back.
Rose is in danger, and her mother.

12:48.142 --> 12:49.234
That would be Jackie.

12:50.478 --> 12:52.776
My wife in a parallel universe.

12:53.648 --> 12:56.447
And as for you, Doctor.
At least this time, I know who you are.

12:56.818 --> 12:59.788
Right, yes, fine, hooray,
but I've got to get back, right now.

13:00.154 --> 13:01.576
No, you're not in charge here.

13:02.282 --> 13:06.037
This is our world, not yours.
And you're going to listen for once.

13:10.623 --> 13:12.625
I could transport out of here,
but it only carries one.

13:12.750 --> 13:13.797
And I'm not leaving you.

13:14.585 --> 13:15.711
Follow me anywhere.

13:16.170 --> 13:17.810
What did I do to you all those years ago?

13:18.298 --> 13:19.390
Guess I'm just stupid.

13:21.759 --> 13:23.386
You're the bravest man I've ever met.

13:23.928 --> 13:26.022
- What about the Doctor?
- Oh, all right.

13:26.973 --> 13:28.566
Bravest human.

13:29.726 --> 13:31.194
Well, I can't think what
the Daleks need with me.

13:31.269 --> 13:33.397
I'm nothing to them.

13:33.479 --> 13:34.947
You could be.

13:35.940 --> 13:40.036
Whatever's inside that Ark, it's waking up.
And I've seen this happen before.

13:40.111 --> 13:43.081
<i>First time I saw a Dalek, it was broken.</i>

13:44.115 --> 13:46.743
[It was dying. But] touched it.

13:47.452 --> 13:49.454
And the moment I did that,

13:49.537 --> 13:50.629
I brought it back to life.

13:53.750 --> 13:55.593
So the Doctor said,

13:56.461 --> 13:59.761
when you travel in time, in the Tardis,
you soak up all this...

14:00.882 --> 14:02.555
background radiation.

14:03.426 --> 14:05.099
It's harmless, it's just there.

14:07.138 --> 14:08.765
But in the Time War,

14:08.848 --> 14:11.601
the Daleks evolved so they could use it
as a power supply.

14:12.185 --> 14:14.529
- I love it when you talk technical.
- Shut up.

14:17.398 --> 14:20.368
But if the Daleks have got something
inside that thing and it needs waking up...

14:20.443 --> 14:21.615
They need you.

14:22.403 --> 14:24.952
You've travelled in time.
Either one of us would do.

14:25.448 --> 14:27.888
But why would they build something
they can't open themselves?

14:27.909 --> 14:30.412
The technology is stolen.

14:31.287 --> 14:34.791
The Ark is not of Dalek design.

14:35.041 --> 14:36.338
Then who built it?

14:36.459 --> 14:38.382
The Time Lords.

14:38.461 --> 14:41.931
This is all that survives
of their home world.

14:43.174 --> 14:46.144
- But what's inside?
- The future.

14:50.807 --> 14:53.936
When you left this world,
you warned us there'd be more Cybermen.

14:54.310 --> 14:56.187
So we sealed them inside the factories.

14:56.270 --> 14:58.113
Except people argued.

14:59.315 --> 15:00.908
Said they were living,

15:01.734 --> 15:03.532
we should help them.

15:03.611 --> 15:05.409
And the debate went on,

15:05.488 --> 15:08.037
but all that time, the Cybermen made plans.

15:08.449 --> 15:10.543
Infiltrated this version of Torchwood.

15:10.660 --> 15:13.914
Mapped themselves onto your world
and then vanished.

15:14.247 --> 15:15.999
- When was this?
- Three years ago.

15:20.002 --> 15:21.549
It's taken them three
years to cross the Void,

15:21.629 --> 15:23.176
but we can pop to and fro in a second?

15:24.215 --> 15:26.843
Must be the sheer mass of five million
Cybermen crossing all at once.

15:26.926 --> 15:29.179
Yeah. Mickey said you'd rattle off
that sort of stuff.

15:29.303 --> 15:30.850
Where is the Mickey boy?

15:30.930 --> 15:32.147
He went ahead first.

15:32.974 --> 15:35.693
Any chance to go and find Miss Rose Tyler.

15:36.894 --> 15:38.567
She's your daughter.

15:39.188 --> 15:41.532
- You do know that? Did Mickey explain?
- She's not mine.

15:42.233 --> 15:44.281
She's the child of a dead man.

15:45.695 --> 15:47.914
Look at it. A world at peace.

15:48.614 --> 15:52.289
- We're calling this the Golden Age.
- Who's the president now?

15:52.743 --> 15:56.418
- A woman called Harriet Jones.
- I'd keep an eye on her.

15:56.914 --> 15:58.211
But it's a lie.

15:58.332 --> 16:01.461
Temperatures have risen by two degrees
in the past six months.

16:01.544 --> 16:04.718
The ice caps are melting. They're
saying all of this is gonna be flooded.

16:06.549 --> 16:08.392
That's not just global warming, is it?

16:08.676 --> 16:11.225
- No.
- It's the breach.

16:11.971 --> 16:15.475
I've been trying to tell you. Travel
between parallel worlds is impossible.

16:15.558 --> 16:18.107
Then the Daleks break down
the walls with the Sphere.

16:18.311 --> 16:20.191
- "Daleks"?
- Then the Cybermen travelled across,

16:20.229 --> 16:22.652
then you lot, those discs,
every time you jump

16:22.732 --> 16:25.485
from one reality to another,
you rip a hole in the universe.

16:25.568 --> 16:27.570
This planet is starting to boil!

16:27.695 --> 16:30.073
Keep going and both worlds will fall
into the Void.

16:30.323 --> 16:31.996
But you can stop it?

16:32.366 --> 16:34.164
The famous Doctor.

16:34.243 --> 16:35.665
You can seal the breach.

16:35.745 --> 16:38.089
Leaving five million Cybermen
stranded on my Earth.

16:38.164 --> 16:40.883
That's your problem. I'm protecting
this world and this world only.

16:42.585 --> 16:44.258
Pete Tyler.

16:44.921 --> 16:46.423
I knew you when you were dead.

16:47.590 --> 16:49.592
Now here you are, fighting the fight.

16:51.093 --> 16:52.094
Alone.

16:53.804 --> 16:54.930
There is a chance.

16:56.098 --> 16:57.600
Back on my world,

16:58.434 --> 17:00.027
Jackie Tyler might still be alive.

17:00.102 --> 17:02.696
- My wife died.
- Her husband died. Good match.

17:02.772 --> 17:04.866
There's more important things at stake.

17:06.733 --> 17:07.781
Doctor.

17:08.944 --> 17:09.945
Help us.

17:10.738 --> 17:12.615
What? Close the breach?

17:13.031 --> 17:15.285
Stop the Cybermen? Defeat the Daleks?

17:16.202 --> 17:17.362
Do you believe I can do that?

17:18.954 --> 17:19.955
Yes.

17:21.624 --> 17:22.840
Maybe, that's all I need.

17:24.335 --> 17:25.461
Off we go, then.

17:28.756 --> 17:30.804
First of all, I need to make a phone call.
You don't mind?

17:30.925 --> 17:31.972
You two, guard the door.

17:35.972 --> 17:38.100
- Oh, my God, help me.
- Jackie, you're alive.

17:38.182 --> 17:41.812
- They tried to download me but I ran away.
- Listen, tell me, where are you?

17:42.019 --> 17:44.488
I don't know. Staircase.

17:44.647 --> 17:47.571
Yeah, which one? Is there any sort
of sign, anything to identify it?

17:47.650 --> 17:50.779
- Yes a fire extinguisher.
- Yeah, that helps.

17:50.861 --> 17:53.580
Oh, wait a minute. It says N3.

17:53.739 --> 17:56.288
North corner, staircase three.
Just keep low, we're trying our best.

17:56.409 --> 17:58.787
- Oh, don't leave me.
- I've got to go. I'm sorry.

18:00.288 --> 18:03.417
- Jacqueline Andrea Suzette Tyler.
- She's not my wife.

18:03.791 --> 18:06.089
I was at the wedding.
You got her name wrong.

18:06.168 --> 18:08.421
Now, Jakey-boy. If I could open the
bonding chamber on this thing,

18:08.504 --> 18:09.756
it could work on polycarbide.

18:09.839 --> 18:12.513
- What's "polycarbide"?
- The skin of a Dalek.

18:16.679 --> 18:18.773
Sorry. No white flag,

18:19.181 --> 18:20.854
only had a sheet of A4. Same difference.

18:21.851 --> 18:23.569
Do you surrender?

18:23.894 --> 18:26.238
I surrender, unto you...

18:28.190 --> 18:29.362
a very good idea.

18:30.818 --> 18:33.662
Final stage of awakening!

18:34.071 --> 18:37.371
Your handprint will open the Ark.

18:37.533 --> 18:38.830
Well tough, 'cause I'm not doing it.

18:38.909 --> 18:41.879
Obey or the male will die.

18:41.996 --> 18:43.714
- I can't let them...
- Rose, don't!

18:43.873 --> 18:47.047
- Place your hand upon the casket.
- Allright!

18:48.377 --> 18:50.379
But you're gonna kill us
anyway, so what the hell.

18:52.340 --> 18:54.058
If you, erm...

18:55.092 --> 18:58.016
escaped the Time War,
don't you want to know what happened?

18:58.137 --> 19:00.731
- Place your hand...
- What happened to the Emperor?

19:01.057 --> 19:03.606
The Emperor survived?

19:04.060 --> 19:05.687
Until he met me.

19:06.646 --> 19:09.570
'Cause if these are gonna be my last words,
then you're gonna listen.

19:10.733 --> 19:12.235
I met the Emperor.

19:13.069 --> 19:16.073
And I took the Time Vortex
and poured it into his head

19:16.155 --> 19:17.907
and turned him into dust.

19:19.241 --> 19:20.288
Did you get that?

19:21.452 --> 19:22.669
The God of all Daleks

19:23.412 --> 19:24.413
and I destroyed him.

19:25.748 --> 19:28.592
You will be exterminated!

19:28.709 --> 19:30.837
Oh, now, hold on, wait a minute...

19:31.003 --> 19:34.257
Alert. Alert. You are the Doctor.

19:34.382 --> 19:37.431
Sensors report he is unarmed.

19:37.510 --> 19:38.887
That's me. Always.

19:38.969 --> 19:41.347
Then you are powerless.

19:41.430 --> 19:43.228
Not me. Never.

19:43.432 --> 19:46.356
- How are you?
- Oh. Same old, you know.

19:46.435 --> 19:49.609
Good. And Micketty-Mick-Mickey,
nice to see you.

19:49.689 --> 19:50.690
And you, boss.

19:50.773 --> 19:53.276
Social interaction will cease.

19:53.359 --> 19:56.863
How did you survive the Time War?

19:57.071 --> 19:59.995
By fighting. On the front line.

20:00.616 --> 20:02.493
I was there at the Fall of Arcadia.

20:03.619 --> 20:05.621
Some day, I might even
come to terms with that.

20:06.580 --> 20:08.799
But you lot ran away.

20:08.874 --> 20:11.844
We had to survive.

20:11.961 --> 20:14.055
The last four Daleks in existence.

20:14.296 --> 20:17.175
- So what's so special about you?
- Doctor, they've got names.

20:17.299 --> 20:20.553
I mean, Daleks don't have names, do they?
But one of them said...

20:20.636 --> 20:24.231
- I am Dalek Thay.
- Dalek Sec.

20:24.306 --> 20:27.560
- Dalek Jast.
- Dalek Caan.

20:27.685 --> 20:30.985
So that's it. At last.

20:31.105 --> 20:33.949
The Cult of Skaro.
I thought you were just a legend.

20:34.024 --> 20:36.527
- Who are they?
- A secret order,

20:37.153 --> 20:39.906
above and beyond the Emperor himself.

20:40.531 --> 20:42.784
Their job was to imagine.

20:42.867 --> 20:44.915
Think as the enemy thinks.

20:44.994 --> 20:46.962
Even dare to have names,

20:47.496 --> 20:49.590
all to find new ways of killing.

20:50.124 --> 20:52.843
But that thing, they said it was yours.
I mean Time Lords, they built it,

20:52.960 --> 20:54.303
what does it do?

20:54.378 --> 20:55.880
I don't know. Never seen it before.

20:56.005 --> 20:58.349
But it's Time Lord.

20:59.175 --> 21:02.179
Both sides had secrets.
What is it, what have you done?

21:02.303 --> 21:06.524
Time Lord science will
restore Dalek supremacy.

21:07.349 --> 21:10.273
What does that mean? What sort
of "Time Lord science"? What do you mean?

21:10.352 --> 21:12.855
They said one touch from a time traveller
will wake it up.

21:13.189 --> 21:15.863
Technology using the one
thing a Dalek can't do.

21:16.859 --> 21:18.111
Touch.

21:18.861 --> 21:22.866
Sealed inside your casing,
not feeling anything, ever.

21:23.783 --> 21:28.539
From birth to death,
locked inside a cold metal cage,

21:28.871 --> 21:30.123
completely alone.

21:31.874 --> 21:34.047
That explains your voice.

21:34.919 --> 21:36.796
No wonder you scream.

21:37.046 --> 21:39.515
The Doctor will open the Ark!

21:41.592 --> 21:42.969
The Doctor will not.

21:43.052 --> 21:45.931
You have no way of resisting.

21:46.847 --> 21:49.521
Well, you got me there. Although...

21:50.392 --> 21:51.735
there is always this.

21:51.936 --> 21:54.155
<i>A sonic probe?</i>

21:54.230 --> 21:57.530
- That's screwdriver.
- It is harmless.

21:57.608 --> 22:01.078
Oh, yes. Harmless is just the word.
That's why I like it.

22:01.237 --> 22:04.867
Doesn't kill, doesn't wound, doesn't maim,
but I'll tell you what it does do.

22:05.032 --> 22:07.956
It is very good at opening doors.

22:13.499 --> 22:15.422
Terminate. Terminate.

22:17.419 --> 22:20.047
Alert. Casing impaired, casing impaired.

22:20.172 --> 22:21.640
Rose, get out.

22:21.757 --> 22:25.637
Firepower insufficient,
firepower insufficient.

22:27.096 --> 22:28.143
Come on.

22:28.597 --> 22:32.192
Daleks will be deleted. Delete, delete.

22:33.352 --> 22:34.729
Mickey, come on.

22:34.854 --> 22:36.777
Adapt to Weaponry.

22:37.398 --> 22:39.776
Firepower restored.

22:46.657 --> 22:49.627
Cybermen, primary target.

22:52.454 --> 22:54.752
Jake, protect the stairwell.
The rest of you, come on.

22:59.295 --> 23:03.300
Cybermen have been exterminated.
Daleks are supreme.

23:03.507 --> 23:06.386
The Genesis Ark is primed.

23:07.428 --> 23:11.808
The Ark needs area of thirty square miles.

23:11.891 --> 23:13.313
Move.

23:15.853 --> 23:18.777
Genesis Ark mobile.

23:22.151 --> 23:23.528
I just fell, I didn't mean it.

23:23.611 --> 23:25.158
Mickey, without us, they'd
have opened it by force,

23:25.279 --> 23:27.953
and to do that, they'd have blown up
the sun, so you've done us a favour.

23:28.032 --> 23:29.249
Now, run.

23:45.341 --> 23:48.015
- You will be upgraded.
- No, but you can't...

24:02.232 --> 24:03.734
Pete?

24:05.277 --> 24:06.620
Hello, jacks.

24:06.695 --> 24:10.199
I said there were ghosts. But
that's not fair. Why him?

24:11.200 --> 24:13.749
- I'm not a ghost.
- But you're dead.

24:14.203 --> 24:16.922
You died 20 years ago, Pete.

24:17.039 --> 24:20.043
It's Pete from a different universe.

24:20.876 --> 24:22.549
There are parallel worlds, Jackie.

24:22.628 --> 24:25.632
Every single decision we make
creates a parallel existence,

24:25.714 --> 24:28.012
- a different dimension where...
- Oh, you can shut up.

24:34.473 --> 24:37.272
- You look old.
- You don't.

24:40.437 --> 24:42.735
How can you be standing there?

24:42.856 --> 24:44.654
Just got lucky.

24:45.067 --> 24:46.114
Lived my life.

24:48.487 --> 24:50.410
But you were left on your own.

24:51.949 --> 24:56.079
- You didn't marry again or...?
- There was never anyone else.

24:58.288 --> 25:02.088
Twenty years, though. Look at me.
I never left that flat.

25:03.085 --> 25:06.840
- Did nothing with myself.
- You brought her up.

25:07.423 --> 25:08.845
Rose Tyler.

25:10.134 --> 25:11.761
That's not bad.

25:13.137 --> 25:14.184
Yeah.

25:14.722 --> 25:17.441
In my world, it worked.

25:18.600 --> 25:22.605
All those daft little
plans of mine, it worked.

25:23.897 --> 25:26.491
- Made me rich.
- I don't care about that.

25:28.193 --> 25:30.195
- How rich?
- Very.

25:31.113 --> 25:33.115
I don't care about that.

25:34.616 --> 25:36.243
How very?

25:44.126 --> 25:45.878
Thing is though, jacks,

25:46.795 --> 25:47.887
you're not my wife.

25:49.506 --> 25:53.352
I'm sorry, but you're not.
I mean we both...

25:57.765 --> 25:59.688
You know, it's just sort of...

26:02.186 --> 26:03.358
Oh, come here.

26:15.157 --> 26:18.081
- Exterminate.
- Delete.

26:18.160 --> 26:21.460
- Exterminate.
- Delete, delete.

26:23.582 --> 26:27.337
- Exterminate.
- Delete, delete.

26:31.215 --> 26:33.217
Exterminate.

26:37.304 --> 26:38.681
Exterminate.

26:43.560 --> 26:44.903
Delete.

26:50.484 --> 26:54.580
Emergency, all units will converge
on the Torchwood Tower.

26:54.863 --> 26:58.458
Repeat, all Cybermen to Torchwood.

27:36.446 --> 27:37.493
Come on, please.

27:52.754 --> 27:55.598
Override roof mechanism.

27:58.260 --> 28:00.137
Elevate.

28:03.265 --> 28:06.986
What are they doing?
Why do they need to get outside?

28:07.060 --> 28:11.611
Time Lord science.
What Time Lord science, what is it?

28:16.862 --> 28:18.660
We've got to see what it's doing,
we've got to go back up.

28:18.780 --> 28:20.407
Come on, all of you. Top floor!

28:20.490 --> 28:24.085
That's 45 floors up.
Believe me, I've done them all.

28:25.412 --> 28:26.959
We could always take the lift.

28:34.796 --> 28:37.640
The Genesis Ark will open.

28:53.941 --> 28:55.568
Time Lord science.

28:56.235 --> 28:58.408
It's bigger on the inside.

28:58.946 --> 29:01.165
The Time Lords put those Daleks in there?

29:01.782 --> 29:03.250
What for?

29:03.825 --> 29:05.498
It's a prison ship.

29:06.703 --> 29:07.750
How many Daleks?

29:08.997 --> 29:10.044
Millions.

29:37.484 --> 29:42.160
Exterminate all life forms below.
Exterminate.

29:48.996 --> 29:51.637
I'm sorry, but you've had it.
This world's going to crash and burn.

29:51.707 --> 29:52.833
There's nothing we can do.

29:52.916 --> 29:54.918
We're going home. jacks, take this.

29:55.043 --> 29:58.047
- You're coming with us.
- But they're destroying the city.

29:58.297 --> 30:02.052
Oh, I'd forgotten you could argue.
It's not just London. It's the whole world.

30:02.175 --> 30:06.146
But there's another world,
just waiting for you, jacks, and it's safe.

30:06.221 --> 30:08.315
As long as the Doctor closes the breach.

30:09.182 --> 30:10.229
Doctor?

30:12.894 --> 30:14.237
Oh, I'm ready.

30:14.563 --> 30:16.657
I've got the equipment right here,
thank you, Torchwood.

30:16.732 --> 30:18.905
Slam it down and close off both universes.

30:18.984 --> 30:22.204
But we can't just leave. What about the Daleks?
And the Cybermen?

30:22.279 --> 30:26.375
They're part of the problem and that
makes them part of the solution. Oh, yes.

30:27.242 --> 30:30.496
Well? Isn't anyone going to ask?
What is it with the glasses?

30:30.579 --> 30:33.082
- What is it with the glasses?
- I can see. That's what.

30:33.332 --> 30:36.211
'Cause we've got two separate worlds,
but in between the two separate worlds,

30:36.293 --> 30:38.494
we've got the Void,
that's where the Daleks were hiding,

30:38.503 --> 30:40.471
and the Cybermen travelled
through the Void to get here

30:40.589 --> 30:42.762
and you lot, one world to
another, via the Void.

30:42.924 --> 30:45.677
I like that, "via the Void". Look.

30:46.553 --> 30:48.055
I've been through it, do you see?

30:48.138 --> 30:50.106
Reboot in three minutes.

30:50.766 --> 30:52.734
- What is it?
- Void stuff.

30:53.852 --> 30:56.605
- Like background radiation.
- That's it.

30:56.730 --> 30:58.403
Look at the others.

30:58.482 --> 31:01.611
And the only one who hasn't been
through the Void, your mother.

31:02.652 --> 31:05.075
- First time she's looked normal in her life.
- Oi.

31:05.155 --> 31:07.829
But the Daleks lived inside the Void.
They're bristling with it.

31:07.908 --> 31:11.503
Cybermen, all of them, I just
open the Void. And reverse.

31:11.703 --> 31:13.956
The Void stuff gets sucked back inside.

31:14.039 --> 31:16.713
- Pulling them all in.
- Pulling them all in.

31:16.792 --> 31:19.796
- Sorry, but what's the Void?
- The dead space.

31:20.045 --> 31:21.513
Some people call it hell.

31:21.588 --> 31:24.933
So you're sending the Daleks
and the Cybermen to hell?

31:26.510 --> 31:29.013
Man, I told you he was good.

31:29.096 --> 31:32.475
But it's like you said.
We've all got Void stuff.

31:33.058 --> 31:35.607
Me, too, 'cause we went
to that parallel world.

31:39.439 --> 31:42.067
We're all contaminated.
We'll get pulled in.

31:42.150 --> 31:43.493
That's why you've got to go.

31:43.568 --> 31:45.616
Reboot in two minutes.

31:46.029 --> 31:50.000
Back to Pete's world. Hey, we should
call it that. "Pete's World".

31:51.743 --> 31:54.246
I'm opening the Void,
but only on this side.

31:56.123 --> 31:58.217
You'll be safe on that side.

31:58.625 --> 32:01.378
And then you close it? For good?

32:01.878 --> 32:04.848
The breach itself is soaked in Void stuff.
In the end, it'll close itself.

32:05.173 --> 32:07.096
And that's it. Kaput.

32:07.926 --> 32:11.601
- But you stay on this side?
- But you'll get pulled in.

32:15.100 --> 32:18.730
That's why I got these.

32:19.688 --> 32:22.008
I’ll just have to hold on tight.
Been doing it all my life.

32:22.149 --> 32:24.151
- I'm supposed to go?
- Yeah.

32:24.234 --> 32:27.204
To another world? And
then it gets sealed off?

32:27.279 --> 32:28.326
Yeah.

32:30.198 --> 32:31.245
Forever?

32:32.868 --> 32:34.620
That's not gonna happen.

32:35.871 --> 32:38.249
We haven't got time to argue.
The plan works. We're going.

32:38.331 --> 32:40.379
- You, too, all of us.
- I'm not leaving him.

32:40.459 --> 32:42.461
- I'm not going without her.
- Oh, my God, we're going.

32:42.544 --> 32:44.842
I've had 20 years without
you, so button it.

32:44.963 --> 32:46.135
I'm not leaving her!

32:46.214 --> 32:48.262
- But you've got to.
- Well, that's tough.

32:48.550 --> 32:49.597
Mum.

32:49.676 --> 32:51.553
Reboot in one minute.

32:51.678 --> 32:54.852
I had a life with you for 19 years.

32:56.766 --> 32:58.393
But then I met the Doctor.

32:59.478 --> 33:02.527
And all the things I've seen him do for me,

33:03.648 --> 33:05.742
for you, for all of us,

33:06.902 --> 33:10.281
for the whole stupid planet

33:10.405 --> 33:13.625
and every planet out there.
He does it alone, Mum.

33:16.786 --> 33:18.538
But not anymore.

33:20.874 --> 33:22.717
'Cause now he's got me.

33:32.636 --> 33:33.683
Oh, no, you don't.

33:34.679 --> 33:36.272
He's not doing that to me again.

33:40.685 --> 33:42.437
I think this is the on switch.

33:44.022 --> 33:45.399
But I've got to go back.

33:45.482 --> 33:48.281
The Doctor said, every time we use
one of these, it damages the whole world.

33:48.360 --> 33:49.953
- Now that's it.
- She's your daughter.

33:50.028 --> 33:52.781
She's your daughter, not mine.
That's an order.

33:52.948 --> 33:56.543
Mickey, tell him. Tell him, Mickey! Mickey!

33:56.785 --> 34:00.415
Once the breach collapses, that's it.
You'll never be able to see her again.

34:00.497 --> 34:01.589
Your own mother!

34:01.665 --> 34:05.215
I made my choice a long time ago.
And I'm never going to leave you.

34:07.629 --> 34:09.051
So, what can I do to help?

34:09.130 --> 34:12.725
Systems rebooted. Open access.

34:12.801 --> 34:17.056
Those coordinates over there, set
them all at six. And hurry up.

34:23.895 --> 34:25.989
Get away from me.

34:28.525 --> 34:29.993
We've got Cybermen on the way up.

34:30.902 --> 34:34.121
- How many ﬂoors down?
- Just one.

34:35.824 --> 34:38.168
We will retreat through the breach.

34:38.284 --> 34:40.663
Regain the home world.

34:43.831 --> 34:45.583
You will not pass.

34:45.667 --> 34:47.761
What is the meaning of this?

34:47.835 --> 34:49.884
You will not pass.

34:53.132 --> 34:56.103
I did my duty. For Queen and Country.

34:56.177 --> 34:59.181
I did my duty. For Queen and Country.

34:59.264 --> 35:02.734
I did my duty. For Queen and Country.

35:04.352 --> 35:05.945
Levers operational.

35:06.021 --> 35:07.898
That's more like it. Bit of a smile.

35:08.023 --> 35:09.775
- The old team.
- Hope and Glory.

35:09.858 --> 35:11.138
Mutt and Jeff. Shiver and Shake.

35:11.276 --> 35:13.199
- Which one's Shiver?
- Oh, I'm Shake.

35:18.575 --> 35:19.622
Press the red button.

35:20.952 --> 35:24.877
Breach active. It is the Doctor.
Exterminate him.

35:25.749 --> 35:27.217
Exterminate!

35:27.876 --> 35:29.970
When it starts, just hold on tight.
Shouldn't be too bad for us,

35:30.045 --> 35:33.219
but the Daleks and the Cybermen
are steeped in Void stuff. Are you ready?

35:33.506 --> 35:34.974
So are they.

35:37.052 --> 35:38.099
Let's do it.

35:41.014 --> 35:42.061
Online.

35:53.693 --> 35:56.287
The breach is open. Into the Void!

36:18.259 --> 36:20.432
Emergency temporal shift.

36:44.369 --> 36:45.461
Offline.

36:48.123 --> 36:49.124
Hold on!

37:00.343 --> 37:02.846
I've got to get it upright.

37:18.236 --> 37:19.283
Online and locked.

37:22.157 --> 37:23.579
Rose. Hold on!

37:28.705 --> 37:29.752
Hold on!

37:44.387 --> 37:46.435
No!

38:13.875 --> 38:15.468
Systems closed.

38:16.628 --> 38:20.053
Take me back. Take me back.

38:21.466 --> 38:23.218
Take me back.

38:28.515 --> 38:29.562
It's stopped working.

38:31.851 --> 38:32.898
He did it.

38:34.687 --> 38:36.439
He closed the breach.

40:19.834 --> 40:21.507
Rose.

40:26.090 --> 40:27.842
Last night I had a dream.

40:27.926 --> 40:29.052
Rose.

40:29.135 --> 40:32.355
I heard a voice. And it
was calling my name.

40:32.847 --> 40:34.064
Rose.

40:35.850 --> 40:37.067
Rose.

40:38.895 --> 40:39.987
Rose.

40:40.855 --> 40:43.449
I had a dream.

40:43.524 --> 40:45.572
I told Mum and Dad and Mickey.

40:46.527 --> 40:50.077
[Anyone else would think] was mad
but not those three.

40:50.531 --> 40:51.703
They believed it.

40:51.991 --> 40:56.041
Because they've met the Doctor.
50 they listened to the dream.

40:56.371 --> 40:58.874
He was calling me, and...

41:04.212 --> 41:06.385
And that night, we packed up.

41:13.388 --> 41:15.686
Got into Dad's old jeep. And off we went.

41:24.148 --> 41:26.196
Just like the dream said.

41:28.152 --> 41:29.825
We followed the voice.

41:31.197 --> 41:32.574
Crossed the water,

41:34.575 --> 41:37.624
kept on driving, hundreds
and hundreds of mile.

41:40.832 --> 41:42.755
Because he's calling.

41:42.875 --> 41:43.922
Rose.

41:46.004 --> 41:47.802
<i>Here I am, at fast.</i>

41:49.215 --> 41:51.343
And this is the story of howl died.

42:07.608 --> 42:10.111
- Where are you?
- Inside the Tardis.

42:10.653 --> 42:13.327
There's one tiny little
gap in the universe left.

42:13.448 --> 42:14.620
Just about to close.

42:16.284 --> 42:18.127
And it takes a lot of power
to send this projection.

42:18.202 --> 42:21.001
I'm in orbit around a supernova.

42:21.080 --> 42:23.629
I'm burning up a sun just to say goodbye.

42:27.628 --> 42:30.507
- You look like a ghost.
- Hold on.

42:41.976 --> 42:45.651
- Can ...?
- I'm still just an image. No touch.

42:48.149 --> 42:52.450
- Can't you come through properly?
- The whole thing would fracture.

42:52.528 --> 42:56.032
- Two universes would collapse.
- So?

43:02.121 --> 43:04.249
Where are we? Where did the gap come out?

43:04.332 --> 43:07.586
- We're in Norway.
- Norway. Right.

43:07.668 --> 43:09.887
About 50 miles out of Bergen,

43:10.588 --> 43:15.185
- it's called Dårlig Ulv Stranden.
- Dalek?

43:15.426 --> 43:18.680
Dårlig. It's Norwegian for bad.

43:20.848 --> 43:24.022
This translates as Bad Wolf Bay.

43:29.857 --> 43:31.200
How long have we got?

43:32.193 --> 43:35.197
About two minutes.

43:36.948 --> 43:39.542
I can't think of what to say.

43:45.581 --> 43:47.549
You've still got Mr Mickey, then.

43:48.543 --> 43:50.216
There's five of us now.

43:50.837 --> 43:54.387
Mum, Dad, Mickey and the baby.

43:55.633 --> 43:56.680
You're not...

43:58.594 --> 44:00.892
No. It's Mum.

44:02.223 --> 44:05.193
She's three months gone.
More Tylers on the way.

44:07.395 --> 44:11.650
- And what about you, what are you...
- Yeah, I'm back working in the shop.

44:13.568 --> 44:16.742
- Well, good for you.
- Shut up.

44:16.821 --> 44:17.868
Nah, I'm not.

44:19.115 --> 44:22.085
There's still a Torchwood on this planet.
It's open for business.

44:23.953 --> 44:26.706
I think I know a thing or two about aliens.

44:26.789 --> 44:29.417
Rose Tyler. Defender of the Earth.

44:33.504 --> 44:36.428
You're dead, officially. Back home.

44:38.467 --> 44:41.061
So many people died that clay
and you've gone missing.

44:42.054 --> 44:44.432
You're on a list of the dead.

44:47.101 --> 44:48.944
But here you are,

44:49.353 --> 44:51.026
living a life, day after day.

44:54.275 --> 44:56.528
The one adventure I can never have.

44:59.697 --> 45:02.291
Am I ever going to see you again?

45:05.786 --> 45:07.413
You can't.

45:08.122 --> 45:10.090
What are you going to do?

45:10.958 --> 45:12.631
I've got the Tardis.

45:13.461 --> 45:15.805
Same old life. Last of the Time Lords.

45:17.506 --> 45:19.383
On your own?

45:26.140 --> 45:27.141
I...

45:34.273 --> 45:35.946
I love you.

45:38.527 --> 45:39.574
Quite right, too.

45:44.909 --> 45:46.707
And I suppose...

45:49.205 --> 45:51.048
if it's my last chance to say it,

45:56.587 --> 45:58.589
Rose Tyler...

47:16.834 --> 47:17.881
What?

47:20.588 --> 47:22.465
- What?
- Who are you?

47:24.133 --> 47:26.227
- Where am I?
- What?

47:26.510 --> 47:29.855
- What the hell is this place?
- What?
