WEBVTT

00:01.628 --> 00:03.365
Halloween--
it's an early Christian deal.

00:03.485 --> 00:04.969
Constantine made a deal
with the Celts

00:05.003 --> 00:06.571
so that they would have
Halloween,

00:06.605 --> 00:09.006
'cause they figured on that day,
the dead would return to earth,

00:09.041 --> 00:12.105
and we dress up spooky
to ward off the dead.

00:12.225 --> 00:13.242
I know, dad.

00:13.276 --> 00:14.543
Did I already tell you
this story?

00:14.577 --> 00:15.511
Yeah, in the car.

00:15.545 --> 00:16.762
Oh.

00:16.813 --> 00:21.567
Wow. You don't see this much
anymore--lady hobo.

00:21.601 --> 00:22.851
Huh?

00:22.886 --> 00:23.852
Maybe.

00:23.887 --> 00:24.820
Eh, maybe.

00:24.854 --> 00:26.989
Oh, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:27.023 --> 00:28.490
Lady ninja.

00:28.525 --> 00:29.491
Sure.

00:29.526 --> 00:31.193
Yeah. Here's one.

00:31.211 --> 00:33.178
Whoa. Here.
Some kind of joke.

00:33.229 --> 00:34.930
Lady president.

00:34.965 --> 00:37.633
It could happen.

00:37.667 --> 00:38.834
Whatever you want, dad.

00:38.868 --> 00:41.036
<i>What do you mean,
whatever i want?</i>

00:41.071 --> 00:42.337
Come on.

00:42.355 --> 00:43.906
Aren't you into this anymore?

00:43.940 --> 00:45.557
Sure, I am.

00:45.592 --> 00:47.743
Be honest.

00:47.777 --> 00:50.512
Dad, I'm super-psyched to go
trick-or-treating with you.

00:50.547 --> 00:53.549
I know how much you like looking
into our neighbor's houses.

00:53.583 --> 00:55.617
Listen, I know that
trick-or-treating is something

00:55.652 --> 00:58.987
you and I do together,
but if you're over this,

00:59.107 --> 01:00.230
I am...

01:00.350 --> 01:02.063
I'm okay with it.

01:02.183 --> 01:03.411
Really?

01:03.531 --> 01:05.435
I don't want to cause
a medical problem.

01:07.097 --> 01:08.583
I'm really okay.

01:08.703 --> 01:10.904
I don't want
to go trick-or-treating.

01:10.938 --> 01:13.340
Huh.

01:15.743 --> 01:18.745

01:22.690 --> 01:24.491
Are you sure you're not mad?

01:24.525 --> 01:25.909
Yeah, I'm sure I'm not mad.
I'm okay.

01:25.943 --> 01:27.594
It's just that I'm 13 now,

01:27.628 --> 01:30.414
and the whole dress-up thing
kinda seems ridiculous.

01:30.448 --> 01:32.032
Arr!

01:34.869 --> 01:38.038
Shiver me timbers!

01:38.072 --> 01:40.240
Isn't that the patch I wore
when I had pinkeye?

01:40.258 --> 01:42.542
Oh, yeah.

01:43.628 --> 01:46.797
Oh, that outfit is
so embarrassing.

01:46.848 --> 01:48.682
What's her problem?

01:48.716 --> 01:53.170
Well, maybe it's that we're used
to seeing you more as a mom

01:53.204 --> 01:56.273
and less as a prostitute.

01:56.307 --> 01:58.959
I'm a pirate princess.

01:58.993 --> 02:00.127
Yeah.

02:00.161 --> 02:01.094
Shouldn't your treasures be

02:01.129 --> 02:03.563
a little more buried?

02:03.597 --> 02:05.265
Every year we go
to the Millers' party,

02:05.299 --> 02:07.367
and every year I'm
the me goody-goody character,

02:07.402 --> 02:09.402
like Alice in Wonderland
or Cinderella.

02:09.437 --> 02:11.555
Last year you went
as Margaret Thatcher.

02:11.606 --> 02:14.241
Last year I didn't dress up.

02:16.154 --> 02:17.454
Let me finish.

02:17.489 --> 02:18.655
You know, I just thought

02:18.690 --> 02:20.257
I'd shake things up a little.

02:20.291 --> 02:22.860
Well, you sure are,
every time you move.

02:22.894 --> 02:25.295
So, uh, you like it?

02:25.329 --> 02:27.898
Well, would you be
willing to wear that

02:27.932 --> 02:30.267
to our anniversary weekend
at the cabin?

02:30.301 --> 02:31.769
Mm... maybe.

02:31.803 --> 02:33.637
I like it.
Mm.

02:33.671 --> 02:35.389
Dad, did you happen
to pick up the kitty costume

02:35.440 --> 02:37.274
I reserved for Stella's party?

02:37.308 --> 02:39.543
Oh, yeah. The fur-lined bikini
with the cat ears?

02:39.577 --> 02:40.544
Yep. That's the one.

02:40.578 --> 02:41.895
Yeah, I saw it.

02:41.946 --> 02:44.198
That's why I got you this.

02:45.850 --> 02:48.285
What is that?

02:48.319 --> 02:51.688
This is Garfield,
America's favorite cat.

02:51.706 --> 02:54.992
But that--that would cover
my entire body.

02:55.026 --> 02:56.160
That's right. Here.
Take this.

02:56.194 --> 02:57.327
Dad.
Listen, Halloween is not

02:57.361 --> 02:59.229
an excuse for you
to dress up like a tramp.

02:59.264 --> 03:00.798
Baby, you are better than that.

03:00.832 --> 03:02.699
No, I'm not.

03:02.734 --> 03:04.468
Honey, your father's right.

03:04.502 --> 03:07.254
That alley cat costume
is totally inappropriate.

03:08.439 --> 03:11.308
Honey, do your panties
say "booty"?

03:13.011 --> 03:15.179
Oh, gross.
Dad just said "panties."

03:15.213 --> 03:16.730
Don't forget the head.

03:16.764 --> 03:19.349
Hey, mom. Can you take Boyd?
'Cause I'm late for my shift.

03:19.383 --> 03:21.735
Hey. Oh, you have
to work on Halloween?

03:21.769 --> 03:23.654
Yeah, but, you know,
I don't mind.

03:23.688 --> 03:26.190
People tend to tip bigger when
they're dressed like idiots.

03:26.224 --> 03:27.324
Yeah, it was last year

03:27.358 --> 03:29.743
that Frankenstein guy
gave her a $100 tip.

03:29.777 --> 03:33.397
Yeah, but that's just because
I screwed his knob back on.

03:33.431 --> 03:35.532
Does anybody need to hear that?

03:37.202 --> 03:38.702
So Boyd's dinner is
in the refrigerator,

03:38.736 --> 03:40.337
and his pajamas are on his bed.

03:40.371 --> 03:41.738
And look at the costume
I got him.

03:41.756 --> 03:43.040
Baby, look at this.

03:43.074 --> 03:44.908
No, no, no. Dad,
Boyd's not trick-or-treating.

03:44.926 --> 03:46.409
No, I can take him.

03:46.427 --> 03:48.879
No, no. He's too young for
all that pagan death imagery.

03:48.913 --> 03:50.180
Pagan death imagery?

03:50.215 --> 03:52.299
Yeah, you know, like skeletons,
ghosts, zombies.

03:52.350 --> 03:54.351
Ugh. It's just like
the ancient Celts,

03:54.385 --> 03:56.353
who put on costumes to avoid
being recognized as humans

03:56.387 --> 03:57.871
by evil spirits.

03:57.906 --> 04:01.291
So that stuff sinks in,
not the stuff like

04:01.326 --> 04:03.493
maybe check your oil
before the engine seizes up

04:03.528 --> 04:05.696
or using proper birth control?

04:08.317 --> 04:10.085
Look, I don't want any of that
sinking into Boyd's head.

04:10.119 --> 04:11.586
Nothing's sinking in.
He's 2.

04:11.620 --> 04:13.488
I tell that kid five times
a day to pull my finger.

04:13.522 --> 04:16.224
He still has no idea where
the noise is coming from.

04:16.257 --> 04:18.760
I'm sorry, dad.
No trick-or-treating.

04:18.793 --> 04:20.595
Listen, we don't want
this kid being that weird kid

04:20.629 --> 04:21.796
that can't go out on Halloween.

04:21.831 --> 04:23.465
Oh, come on. He's not
gonna be the weird kid.

04:23.499 --> 04:24.449
He will if we're not careful.

04:24.483 --> 04:25.483
Look, I'm not
the perfect father,

04:25.534 --> 04:26.418
but I didn't raise any weirdos.

04:26.452 --> 04:27.635
Ohh.

04:29.000 --> 04:35.074

04:38.979 --> 04:42.034
I think
someone threw up in here.

04:46.623 --> 04:49.659
Hi. Mike Baxter here
for Outdoor Man,

04:49.693 --> 04:51.460
and we know
what you guys like--

04:51.478 --> 04:55.731
a firm rump, long legs,
great rack.

04:55.766 --> 04:57.366
Ha ha.
We're talking deer here.

04:57.401 --> 04:58.551
That's right,

04:58.585 --> 05:00.519
'cause Halloween is deer season
up in the hills.

05:00.554 --> 05:02.488
It's time to get out there
and do some huntin'.

05:02.539 --> 05:04.540
Before we do that, we gotta
think about gun safety.

05:04.558 --> 05:05.508
We got a guy here
that's gonna tell us

05:05.542 --> 05:07.142
how to take our guns
out of storage.

05:07.160 --> 05:08.143
Gary McKegger here...

05:08.161 --> 05:09.378
He's a firearms expert--

05:09.413 --> 05:11.797
ballistics, bullets,
knows everything about guns.

05:11.832 --> 05:14.383
Gary, once we got
the bolt clean,

05:14.418 --> 05:15.534
you're gonna...

05:15.569 --> 05:16.736
Probably wanna
hold on to the gun,

05:16.787 --> 05:18.304
tell us about--
here you go.

05:18.338 --> 05:19.588
Any time you're ready...

05:19.623 --> 05:22.692
You just tell us exactly how
to pull it out of storage.

05:25.389 --> 05:28.090
Gary is not afraid
of any animal,

05:28.108 --> 05:31.327
but much like the Rhesus monkey,
he's terrified of cameras.

05:31.361 --> 05:33.896
Gary. Gary. All right.

05:33.931 --> 05:38.034
Let's take a break and maybe get
Gary an energy bar or...

05:38.068 --> 05:39.435
This is just horrible,

05:39.469 --> 05:40.803
and--and you know
what else?

05:40.838 --> 05:42.338
Your girlfriend says I can't
trick-or-treat with Boyd.

05:42.372 --> 05:44.440
I know.

05:44.474 --> 05:45.408
Can you talk to her?

05:45.442 --> 05:46.375
No way.

05:46.443 --> 05:47.643
What do you mean, no way?

05:47.678 --> 05:49.028
Look, I said to her,

05:49.079 --> 05:50.613
"aren't you excited
about Halloween?"

05:50.647 --> 05:52.615
And she said, "not really."

05:52.649 --> 05:55.017
I said, "me neither."

05:55.052 --> 05:56.969
Now I'm stuck.

05:57.004 --> 05:59.488
Nice backbone, Susan.

06:00.858 --> 06:04.460
Hey, Ed.
Your gun expert is a moron.

06:04.494 --> 06:05.928
He's acting like a zombie
in front of the camera.

06:05.963 --> 06:08.464
Oh, Halloween humor.
I like that.

06:08.498 --> 06:09.782
You coming to my house
tonight to trick-or-treat?

06:09.833 --> 06:11.033
With who?

06:11.068 --> 06:12.501
Eve doesn't want
to trick-or-treat anymore,

06:12.536 --> 06:15.328
and grandpa's not allowed
to take Boyd out.

06:15.448 --> 06:17.882
Wait a minute.
Halloween builds character.

06:17.916 --> 06:20.652
Any 2-year-old who can walk up
to a man with a chain saw

06:20.686 --> 06:23.822
and demand candy
can do anything.

06:25.515 --> 06:28.417
Boyd should be allowed
to experience Halloween now,

06:28.451 --> 06:31.220
while his brain is still soft.

06:31.254 --> 06:32.521
Exactly.

06:32.555 --> 06:34.490
You know, I knew
this day was coming. I did.

06:34.524 --> 06:37.009
This is going
to be a lousy Halloween.

06:37.060 --> 06:39.895
Come on, Mike. Don't be
such a Debbie Downer.

06:39.913 --> 06:42.898
I know what will cheer you up.

06:42.932 --> 06:45.034
Please, Ed, don't put on
"Monster Mash."

06:45.068 --> 06:46.869
Why do you think I'm going
to play "Monster Mash"?

06:46.903 --> 06:50.005
You think you know me so well.

06:52.275 --> 06:53.859
<i>♪ I was working in the lab... ♪</i>

06:53.910 --> 06:55.377
You got me. You got me.

06:55.411 --> 06:59.114
I dare you not to smile.
I dare you. Come on, Mike.

06:59.149 --> 07:00.816
You see, most people think
this song is about

07:00.850 --> 07:02.785
monsters having a party.

07:02.819 --> 07:04.319
'Cause, Ed...

07:04.354 --> 07:08.062
<i>It is about monsters
having a party.</i>

07:08.182 --> 07:09.172
You know what else it's about?

07:09.207 --> 07:10.700
Please don't tell me
it's about family.

07:10.820 --> 07:12.719
It's about family.

07:15.507 --> 07:17.497
Ahoy.

07:19.579 --> 07:21.246
Hey, you want to help me
hand out candy?

07:21.280 --> 07:23.448
Want me to help you find
your pants?

07:23.482 --> 07:25.250
Very funny.

07:26.252 --> 07:27.218
Oh, here we go.

07:27.253 --> 07:28.186
Trick or treat!

07:28.220 --> 07:31.530
Hey, I say, "treat"!

07:31.650 --> 07:33.033
Vanessa?

07:33.068 --> 07:34.101
Hey, Bill.

07:34.135 --> 07:35.569
Wow.

07:35.603 --> 07:37.471
Who knew?

07:37.505 --> 07:39.439
Who knew what?

07:39.457 --> 07:40.741
Uh, nothing.

07:40.775 --> 07:43.877
It's just that I never...
Thought of you...

07:43.912 --> 07:45.001
Like that.

07:47.653 --> 07:49.020
We should go.

07:50.940 --> 07:53.291
That was weird.

07:53.326 --> 07:54.692
Well, off to Stella's party,

07:54.710 --> 07:58.213
dressed as some
ridiculous overweight cat.

07:58.247 --> 07:59.564
I think you look adorable.

07:59.598 --> 08:01.199
Me, too.
I could totally see you

08:01.233 --> 08:03.534
floating over
a Thanksgiving day parade.

08:04.754 --> 08:07.205
And the evening just keeps
getting better and better.

08:09.091 --> 08:12.010
Ooh.

08:12.044 --> 08:13.778
At ease, everyone.

08:15.563 --> 08:17.009
Who am I?

08:17.044 --> 08:18.394
Um, John Wayne--
"Longest Day."

08:18.428 --> 08:19.512
No.

08:19.546 --> 08:20.579
John Wayne-- "Sands
of Iwo Jima." Nope.

08:20.614 --> 08:21.564
John Wayne--
"Green Berets."

08:21.598 --> 08:22.565
Bingo.

08:22.599 --> 08:23.983
Oh.

08:24.017 --> 08:25.851
With his trusty sidekick...

08:25.886 --> 08:28.521
Ah.
Señor bones.

08:28.555 --> 08:30.923
Oh! Look how cute.

08:32.409 --> 08:34.894
Hey, wait. You're not taking him
trick-or-treating, are you?

08:34.928 --> 08:37.029
No, we're just gonna sit
here and hand out candy,

08:37.063 --> 08:38.831
like all the other shut-ins.

08:41.068 --> 08:42.434
Speaking of the candy,

08:42.469 --> 08:44.169
where's all the good stuff
we bought?

08:44.203 --> 08:46.372
In my nightstand.

08:47.624 --> 08:49.475
I'll get it.

08:51.211 --> 08:52.712
He looks really cute.

08:52.746 --> 08:53.929
Doesn't he?

08:53.964 --> 08:55.548
You know who would really
think he was cute is

08:55.582 --> 08:56.982
that old lady on the corner,
Mrs. Tanner.

08:57.017 --> 08:58.150
She's, like, 90.

08:58.185 --> 09:00.219
She doesn't have
many Halloweens left.

09:00.253 --> 09:02.438
I say we go down there and show
her this little costume.

09:02.472 --> 09:04.023
We won't trick-or-treat.

09:04.057 --> 09:05.691
We'll just walk around and look
at the houses and decorations.

09:05.726 --> 09:06.692
You want to go with us?

09:06.727 --> 09:08.461
Uh, dad,
Kristin told you not to.

09:08.495 --> 09:11.097
The last time
I checked my watch,

09:11.131 --> 09:13.332
it still said, "America."

09:13.366 --> 09:16.268
That doesn't even make sense.

09:23.845 --> 09:26.247
Wow. Look at this place.

09:26.281 --> 09:29.083
Ooh, spooky.

09:29.134 --> 09:32.003
Happy Halloween, guys.

09:34.489 --> 09:35.690
Okay.

09:35.724 --> 09:38.426
Those are the wrong wings.

09:39.831 --> 09:42.349
All right. Don't be scared.

09:43.918 --> 09:45.352
Trick or treat.

09:46.838 --> 09:49.873
Hey. Hey, Ed.

09:49.908 --> 09:51.091
You made it, Mike.
Thank you.

09:51.126 --> 09:52.426
Well, it wouldn't be Halloween

09:52.460 --> 09:53.727
without stopping
by your house, Ed.

09:53.762 --> 09:55.896
Hey, Boyd.
How are ya, pal?

09:55.930 --> 09:57.114
Uh-huh.

09:57.148 --> 09:59.033
Listen, I don't want to crap
all over your outfit,

09:59.067 --> 10:01.635
but that's not even
anatomically close.

10:03.661 --> 10:06.112
So Kristin changed
her mind, huh?

10:06.163 --> 10:08.097
No, no, no. I changed my mind
about listening to her.

10:08.132 --> 10:09.966
I mean, come on.
You gotta blame Boyd here.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.818
He looks so darn cute
in the thing, doesn't he?

10:11.852 --> 10:13.019
Look at that.
Oh, yeah, but what if...

10:13.070 --> 10:14.854
What if Kristin finds out?

10:14.905 --> 10:16.372
I'm a green beret.

10:16.407 --> 10:19.075
Do I look like I'm afraid
of what my daughter's gonna say?

10:19.109 --> 10:20.210
That's good,

10:20.244 --> 10:21.494
'cause she's coming up
the walk.

10:21.529 --> 10:22.579
What?
Mm-hmm.

10:24.782 --> 10:25.715
Whoo-hoo.

10:27.017 --> 10:29.452
Look at this place, Ed.
I mean, it's amazing.

10:29.487 --> 10:30.420
It's better than last year.

10:30.454 --> 10:31.721
Yeah, thanks.

10:31.755 --> 10:33.857
I'm kinda showing off
for my new lady friend.

10:33.891 --> 10:35.825
Mm? Whoa.

10:35.860 --> 10:36.860
Mm. Yes. Yes.
Hello.

10:36.894 --> 10:39.596
Hello.

10:39.630 --> 10:40.847
Hi there.

10:40.881 --> 10:45.391
I'm Mike Baxter,
and you look like Elvira.

10:45.511 --> 10:48.190
I am Elvira.

10:48.723 --> 10:51.604
I travel first-class, Mike,
or I don't travel at all.

10:53.218 --> 10:56.318
<i>I am gonna go mix up
some very bloody marys.</i>

10:56.353 --> 10:58.253
Mm-hmm.

10:58.271 --> 11:00.089
Excuse me.

11:00.156 --> 11:03.158
She really goes all out
for Halloween, huh?

11:03.193 --> 11:05.794
She has no idea it's Halloween.

11:07.163 --> 11:09.181
Happy Halloween, Mike.
And I'll see you tomorrow.

11:09.215 --> 11:11.900
There you go.
Happy Halloween.

11:18.616 --> 11:20.016
Where'd your dad go?

11:20.051 --> 11:20.984
I can't tell you.

11:21.018 --> 11:21.952
Where's Boyd?

11:21.986 --> 11:22.953
I can't tell you.

11:22.987 --> 11:24.154
Did he take Boyd
trick-or-treating?

11:24.188 --> 11:25.455
That's what I can't tell you.

11:25.473 --> 11:27.924
Arr.

11:27.942 --> 11:30.977
And I'm not just saying that
'cause I'm a pirate.

11:31.012 --> 11:32.796
Whatever.

11:32.814 --> 11:33.963
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

11:33.981 --> 11:36.716
You love Halloween.
What's going on?

11:36.751 --> 11:37.934
Nothing.

11:37.969 --> 11:39.436
No, and let's skip the part
where I keep asking

11:39.470 --> 11:41.304
and you keep saying
"nothing."

11:41.339 --> 11:44.158
It's Victor Blake.

11:44.278 --> 11:45.812
Oh, the nice boy
whose ankle you broke?

11:45.846 --> 11:46.813
It was a stress fracture.

11:46.847 --> 11:48.848
Oh, all right.

11:48.883 --> 11:50.917
He thinks Halloween is
for kids.

11:50.951 --> 11:52.018
So?

11:52.052 --> 11:53.987
I want him to see me
as a woman.

11:54.021 --> 11:56.956
Well, honey...
You're in the eighth grade.

11:56.991 --> 11:58.625
Yeah, and he's in ninth.
He's practically a year away

11:58.659 --> 12:01.160
from being almost old enough
to learn how to drive.

12:01.195 --> 12:02.862
Yeah.

12:02.897 --> 12:06.032
Ohh. Hold that thought.

12:09.348 --> 12:11.315
Hello again, Bill.

12:11.350 --> 12:14.051
Hi, Vanessa. Did I leave
my keys someplace?

12:14.069 --> 12:15.653
In your hand.

12:15.687 --> 12:17.255
Oh, God.

12:17.289 --> 12:21.726
I am such a goofball.

12:22.861 --> 12:24.562
Ah.

12:24.596 --> 12:26.130
Anything else?

12:26.164 --> 12:28.199
Things aren't so great at home.

12:30.161 --> 12:31.595
I should go.

12:31.629 --> 12:32.930
Hi, Mike.

12:32.964 --> 12:34.898
Hey.

12:34.933 --> 12:37.901
Biggest candy haul ever,

12:37.936 --> 12:39.520
except the dentist
down the street

12:39.571 --> 12:41.088
gives you toothbrushes.

12:41.122 --> 12:43.490
There's something wrong
with that.

12:43.541 --> 12:45.776
I can't believe you took Boyd
trick-or-treating.

12:45.810 --> 12:46.944
Well, believe it.

12:46.978 --> 12:47.945
Kristin is gonna kill you.

12:47.979 --> 12:49.296
Oh, cut it out.

12:49.347 --> 12:50.714
She's not gonna find out
about it. A little nougat.

12:50.748 --> 12:53.016
We had a great time,
right, Boyd?

12:56.888 --> 12:57.988
Uh...

13:08.621 --> 13:10.755
Wait a minute.
That's the Wong kid.

13:10.789 --> 13:12.824
<i>I know it's the wong kid.
Where's Boyd?</i>

13:12.858 --> 13:15.460
No, I mean, that's Jimmy Wong
from down the street.

13:15.494 --> 13:18.596
But if we have Jimmy Wong,
then where's...

13:27.685 --> 13:29.553
I gotta go find Boyd. Call the Wongs
and the police.

13:29.587 --> 13:31.288
Tell them I'm checking all the
way up to Hudson street.

13:31.322 --> 13:33.790
Hello?
Oh, thank goodness.

13:33.825 --> 13:35.158
Wait. Mike! Mike.
Mike, wait.

13:35.193 --> 13:37.627
Come back. Come back.
It's the Wongs. They have Boyd.

13:37.662 --> 13:39.362
Ohh.
Yes. Yes, we do.

13:39.396 --> 13:40.330
- Okay, that would be great.
- Ohh.

13:40.364 --> 13:41.698
- Thank you so much.
- Oh.

13:41.732 --> 13:44.334
Ohh. Ohh. They're on their
way over with Boyd right now.

13:44.368 --> 13:48.205
Ah. Empty the cauldron.
I think I gotta throw up.

13:48.239 --> 13:50.100
Just relax. It--I think
it's gonna be okay.

13:50.220 --> 13:52.972
Okay? I just about lost
our grandson.

13:53.006 --> 13:55.591
Yeah, and then kidnapped
another kid.

13:55.609 --> 13:57.109
I didn't kidnap anybody.

13:57.144 --> 13:58.528
I just grabbed
somebody else's kid,

13:58.562 --> 14:01.910
gave him a bunch of candy,
and brought him to my house.

14:02.030 --> 14:03.864
Mike, could--could you
please not repeat

14:03.898 --> 14:04.831
that story to the police?

14:04.866 --> 14:06.099
Ohh.

14:06.134 --> 14:08.068
How could you not know that
this wasn't Boyd?

14:08.102 --> 14:10.170
It's Halloween,
for God sakes. It's--

14:10.188 --> 14:12.445
this neighborhood's filthy
with skeletons.

14:12.565 --> 14:15.534
As it turns out, it--it's not
that original of an outfit.

14:17.237 --> 14:18.671
Hey, Mandy.

14:18.705 --> 14:20.906
Hey, guys. Hey.

14:20.940 --> 14:23.509
Were you just trying
to sneak by us?

14:23.543 --> 14:24.977
No. No. No, no.

14:25.011 --> 14:27.346
Really? 'Cause it seemed like
you were slinkin' in.

14:27.364 --> 14:29.999
No. I'm a cat, remember?
So... Good night.

14:30.050 --> 14:32.351
Get down here.

14:32.385 --> 14:34.753
Right now. Right here.

14:36.262 --> 14:38.646
Open that coat.

14:47.785 --> 14:49.486
Where's the Garfield costume?

14:49.520 --> 14:50.487
Dad, this is Garfield.
Look, look, look.

14:50.521 --> 14:51.438
Ohh.
This is his tail,

14:51.472 --> 14:53.990
and these are his ears.

14:54.025 --> 14:55.192
Where's his head?

14:55.226 --> 14:56.960
It's in a dumpster
behind the gas station.

14:58.537 --> 15:01.338
You know, I put a deposit
on that head.

15:01.373 --> 15:03.390
Hey, that's
Becky Wong's little brother.

15:03.442 --> 15:04.992
She's in the grade behind me.

15:05.026 --> 15:06.310
Yeah, for now.

15:06.344 --> 15:08.179
Yeah, I used to babysit him.

15:08.213 --> 15:09.380
Good. You can babysit him
right now.

15:09.414 --> 15:10.731
- Keep him comfortable, will ya?
-  All right.

15:10.766 --> 15:11.949
Ohh.

15:11.983 --> 15:13.984
Oh, thank goodness.
That must be judge Wong...

15:14.019 --> 15:16.220
And her husband.

15:19.766 --> 15:21.033
Was that Wong?

15:21.067 --> 15:23.552
No, that was Bill Calhoun
from up the street.

15:23.587 --> 15:27.373
Remind me to get our spare key
back from them.

15:27.407 --> 15:30.192
Uh, hey, dad. I think I just
heard Kristin parking her car.

15:30.227 --> 15:31.393
Everything's gonna be fine.

15:31.428 --> 15:33.145
<i>Okay. Why are you telling me?</i>

15:33.180 --> 15:34.513
I'm practicing.
Okay.

15:34.564 --> 15:36.332
Listen, I'm gonna
just stall her

15:36.366 --> 15:37.967
until the Wongs get here
with Boyd.

15:38.001 --> 15:39.101
Hey, keep a low center
of gravity.

15:39.135 --> 15:40.788
She'll never get by you.

15:43.916 --> 15:45.833
Hi, dad.
Hey, sweetie.

15:45.885 --> 15:47.685
<i>Get any monster tips?</i>

15:48.954 --> 15:49.888
You get it?

15:49.922 --> 15:51.489
Yeah, because I heard it

15:51.523 --> 15:52.857
40 times tonight,

15:52.892 --> 15:54.258
but, you know,
you said it the best, dad.

15:54.276 --> 15:55.226
Hey, where are you going?

15:55.261 --> 15:56.544
I'm gonna go check on Boyd.

15:56.579 --> 15:58.162
Before you go, I'd like
to know about your day,

15:58.180 --> 15:59.664
so catch me up.

15:59.698 --> 16:01.249
Um, well, it sucked.
You're all caught up.

16:01.283 --> 16:04.185
Hey, come on.
It's a diner. Halloween.

16:04.219 --> 16:06.470
There must be something
to make dad laugh. Come on.

16:06.488 --> 16:09.674
Um, okay. Um...
Hmm, hmm. Oh. Oh!

16:09.708 --> 16:13.788
The, uh, fry cook wore a costume
that was highly flammable.

16:13.908 --> 16:15.408
Kitchen bloopers.

16:15.442 --> 16:16.359
Right? That's funny.
- Yeah.

16:16.393 --> 16:17.410
I thought you would like that.

16:17.444 --> 16:20.046
Yeah. Wait. No, um...
Oh, boy. Uh...

16:20.080 --> 16:21.772
Hold on, Kristin.
Stop for a second.

16:22.035 --> 16:23.034
Let me tell you something.

16:23.052 --> 16:24.803
I ended up taking Boyd
trick-or-treating.

16:24.837 --> 16:26.705
Uh, after I said not to?

16:26.739 --> 16:27.773
Mm-hmm.

16:27.807 --> 16:29.574
Ohh! I have never been
so angry at you.

16:29.609 --> 16:31.193
Stick around.

16:34.533 --> 16:36.734
I'm sorry. Who's this?

16:36.768 --> 16:38.603
Boyd's on his way back here
right now.

16:38.637 --> 16:39.687
Back from where?

16:39.722 --> 16:41.773
Because everybody that he knows
is in this room.

16:41.807 --> 16:43.675
The Wongs'.
The Wongs'?

16:44.743 --> 16:47.145
That's probably them right now.

16:47.179 --> 16:49.948
You'll be laughing
about this tomorrow morning.

16:49.982 --> 16:51.449
I can explain.

16:53.606 --> 16:55.190
Hey, Victor.

16:55.241 --> 16:57.208
Yes, sir.
Um, can I talk to Eve?

16:57.242 --> 16:58.209
Victor?

16:58.244 --> 16:59.577
Trick or treat.

17:02.315 --> 17:03.915
Dad.

17:06.921 --> 17:08.255
What are you doing here?

17:08.289 --> 17:10.790
I-I thought
you hated Halloween.

17:10.825 --> 17:12.792
<i>Yeah, but I know you like it,</i>

17:12.827 --> 17:15.262
so, listen,
my mom's in the car,

17:15.296 --> 17:16.329
and I was wondering

17:16.364 --> 17:17.431
if you wanted to hang out
at my house

17:17.464 --> 17:20.200
and maybe hand out candy
and stuff.

17:21.402 --> 17:22.569
Dad?

17:22.604 --> 17:24.871
Sure. Have a lot of fun.
Not too much.

17:24.906 --> 17:26.039
I know where you live, Victor.

17:27.405 --> 17:29.089
Yes, sir.

17:30.441 --> 17:32.209
Kristin.

17:32.243 --> 17:34.544
Look, I can't live like this.
I am moving in with Kyle.

17:34.579 --> 17:37.014
Ooh! I call dibs on your room.

17:37.048 --> 17:38.448
I am not actually moving in
with Kyle.

17:38.483 --> 17:39.516
It's an empty threat,

17:39.550 --> 17:41.084
like when you say
you're going to college.

17:42.954 --> 17:44.037
Boyd's fine.

17:44.273 --> 17:45.990
He's with, uh,
a family practice judge

17:46.024 --> 17:47.225
and a pediatrician.

17:47.259 --> 17:48.409
He's safer with them
than with us.

17:48.443 --> 17:50.611
Well, I think
you've proven that.

17:50.662 --> 17:52.330
Uh, let's--let's get Jimmy
something to eat.

17:52.364 --> 17:55.349
Ohh. Yeah, I think
he just made some room.

17:55.384 --> 17:56.701
Come on.

18:01.261 --> 18:03.629
Seriously, dad, what the hell?

18:03.663 --> 18:05.264
I took your sister
to get her costume,

18:05.298 --> 18:06.999
and she didn't want
to get a costume,

18:07.033 --> 18:07.967
so I bought Boyd something,

18:08.001 --> 18:09.201
and he looked really cute
in that,

18:09.235 --> 18:10.169
and I wanted to show him off...

18:10.203 --> 18:11.270
And it just brought back
memories

18:11.304 --> 18:14.373
of taking all you girls
trick-or-treating,

18:14.407 --> 18:17.676
and I think I, uh, you know,
got too excited with Boyd.

18:17.711 --> 18:20.179
I'm sorry about that.

18:20.213 --> 18:22.948
So did Boyd have fun?

18:24.737 --> 18:27.672
Up--up until I lost him,
yeah.

18:30.142 --> 18:31.776
Boyd's first Halloween.

18:31.810 --> 18:33.545
I really wish
I could have gone with him.

18:33.579 --> 18:35.947
It's not that late.
You're dressed as a waitress.

18:36.982 --> 18:37.982
Come on. Go. G--take him.

18:38.017 --> 18:39.184
Okay, okay.

18:39.218 --> 18:41.786
All right. Only if you come
with us, though.

18:41.820 --> 18:43.054
I'd love to.

18:43.088 --> 18:44.022
You know what
would make it perfect?

18:44.056 --> 18:45.023
What?

18:45.057 --> 18:46.758
If we actually had Boyd.

18:47.760 --> 18:48.743
Oh.

18:48.794 --> 18:50.195
She's a judge.
Be very nice to her.

18:50.229 --> 18:52.096
- Okay. All right. Okay.
- Ohh.

18:52.114 --> 18:54.699
- Ohh. Boyd, hey.
- Oh, Boyd! Hi, baby.

18:54.733 --> 18:56.467
Good to see ya, buddy. Come
on in, guys. Ohh. Look at you.

18:56.502 --> 18:58.052
Jimmy! Oh, yay!

18:58.087 --> 19:01.306
Oh, hey, hey. I'm so sorry
about this, doc. Are we okay?

19:01.340 --> 19:03.124
Okay? You took my boy.

19:03.158 --> 19:05.643
Well, they all look alike.

19:05.678 --> 19:07.946
Skeletons.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.954
This is not over.

19:10.074 --> 19:11.658
You know,
you took my grandson, too.

19:11.709 --> 19:12.993
- How do I know who took who first?
- Wait, wait, wait.

19:13.044 --> 19:14.511
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- I know you took mine first.

19:14.545 --> 19:15.512
- You didn't know--
- Mr. Wong, please won't you accept

19:15.546 --> 19:18.181
our most sincere apologies?

19:19.810 --> 19:20.910
Well...

19:20.944 --> 19:22.612
- We are practically neighbors.
- Yeah.

19:22.646 --> 19:23.679
Hug it out?

19:35.562 --> 19:36.512
Thank you very much.

19:36.563 --> 19:37.797
- Thank you.
- Good-bye!

19:37.831 --> 19:39.649
Hey, happy Halloween.
Thank you both for coming over.

19:39.700 --> 19:40.666
- No.
- So sorry!

19:42.436 --> 19:44.803
She is so lovely.

Where's your pirate outfit?

It's--it's in storage.

See you at car pool?

No.

20:30.578 --> 20:32.679
I understand.

20:43.840 --> 20:45.591
All right, Boyd.

20:45.626 --> 20:47.627
This is the first law of hunting. Yay!

20:47.661 --> 20:52.198
If you shoot it,
you gotta eat it.

20:52.232 --> 20:53.399
That's right.

20:53.433 --> 20:55.968
Let's say this is the deer
you just shot

20:56.003 --> 20:57.436
when you were up by our cabin.

20:57.471 --> 21:00.306
Honey, uh, Mike, honey.
He's 2 years old.

21:00.340 --> 21:01.607
I'm just trying to teach him
to eat the whole thing.

21:01.642 --> 21:03.909
Yeah, but do you have
to tell him that he...

21:03.944 --> 21:06.112
He killed it?

21:06.146 --> 21:07.146
Do something appropriate.

21:07.180 --> 21:08.280
Why don't you just say
the spoon

21:08.315 --> 21:09.482
is a--is a choo-choo train
or something?

21:09.516 --> 21:10.950
Make it, you know...

21:10.984 --> 21:12.568
Yeah. Here we go..

21:12.619 --> 21:15.321
The choo-choo train
is coming down the track.

21:15.355 --> 21:17.990
What's in the track but
a big, fat deer?

21:18.024 --> 21:21.027
We killed that deer.
Try this here.

21:23.463 --> 21:26.666
Mmm!
