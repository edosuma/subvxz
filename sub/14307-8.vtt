So, everybody,
put your hands together,

01:42.800 --> 01:43.933
and pull them apart.

01:43.933 --> 01:45.400
Then put them back together
again,

01:45.400 --> 01:47.500
making a skin-on-skin
slapping noise

01:47.500 --> 01:48.900
for Larry Hardcore!

01:48.900 --> 01:51.167
[cheers and applause]

01:51.167 --> 01:53.067
Are you ready to say no
to drugs?

01:53.067 --> 01:54.267
Whoo!

01:54.267 --> 01:56.333
'Cause if you don't
say no to drugs,

01:56.333 --> 01:59.133
you're gonna say yes
to regret.

01:59.133 --> 02:02.100
And believe me, I know a little
something about regret.

02:02.100 --> 02:05.300
I regret the time
that I got "high"

02:05.300 --> 02:06.567
and wrote a hit song

02:06.567 --> 02:09.500
and it made me
insane amounts of coin...

02:09.500 --> 02:13.167
coin I used to buy more drugs...

02:13.167 --> 02:15.133
and a motorboat

02:15.133 --> 02:17.200
and a house for my mom.

02:17.200 --> 02:18.767
Plus I gave some to charity.

02:19.867 --> 02:22.300
See, I was into everything:

02:22.300 --> 02:25.233
weed, grass, ganja, reefer,

02:25.233 --> 02:26.867
marijuana, Mary Jane.

02:26.867 --> 02:28.233
I did it all.

02:28.233 --> 02:29.500
I even smoked pot once.

02:29.500 --> 02:30.500
[all gasp]

02:30.500 --> 02:32.233
I was such a waste case,

02:32.233 --> 02:35.500
I would have probably smoked--
I don't know--raisins

02:35.500 --> 02:37.500
if somebody told me
they got you high.

02:37.500 --> 02:38.800
You can smoke raisins?

02:38.800 --> 02:40.667
I've always enjoyed
ingesting raisins,

02:40.667 --> 02:42.467
but I never thought about
smoking them.

02:42.467 --> 02:44.167
Now I have,
and I want to do it.

02:44.167 --> 02:45.567
It sounds
so dangerous.

02:45.567 --> 02:47.667
(JFK)
Perhaps that scary-looking
hooded fella

02:47.667 --> 02:51.067
lurking in the shadows
knows where we can get some.

02:51.067 --> 02:52.567
[sinister voice]
Yes.

02:52.567 --> 02:54.833
Come to me.

Come to me.

02:56.800 --> 02:59.100

02:59.100 --> 03:00.267

Pardon.

03:00.267 --> 03:02.100
Come to me.

03:02.100 --> 03:04.733
Step into my office.

03:06.100 --> 03:08.067
Hold my calls.

03:08.067 --> 03:11.100
Sun nuggets. Solar babies.
La uva loca.

03:11.100 --> 03:14.167
California's finest,
all for you to smoke-a.

03:14.167 --> 03:17.167
I like your funny words,
magic man.

03:17.167 --> 03:18.867
I'm the pusher!

03:20.567 --> 03:21.600
How many scoops?

03:21.600 --> 03:22.767
Two, please.

03:25.233 --> 03:28.167
[both laughing]

03:28.167 --> 03:31.400
[laughing]
Two scoops of raisins.

03:31.400 --> 03:33.600
Oh, man, that's funny.

03:33.600 --> 03:36.767
So that's why smoking raisins
isn't cool.

03:36.767 --> 03:38.133
Wow, she's right!

03:38.133 --> 03:39.833
That Joan of Arc
is a convincing speaker.

03:39.833 --> 03:40.933
(JFK)
All cool people

03:40.933 --> 03:43.800
report to my van
to smoke raisins!

03:43.800 --> 03:45.833
- Yeah!
- JFK is a convincing speaker.

03:45.833 --> 03:47.233
Are you coming, Abe?

03:47.233 --> 03:49.533
Well, if you are
and everyone else is...

03:49.533 --> 03:51.067
Abe, don't.

03:51.067 --> 03:53.367
What about all you've previously
said about peer pressure?

03:53.367 --> 03:57.167
Joan, Cleo and I have been
dating for two weeks now.

03:57.167 --> 03:59.233
If I don't follow her
to JFK's van,

03:59.233 --> 04:01.567
she might hook up
with someone else.

04:01.567 --> 04:04.133
It's called trust, Joan.

04:04.133 --> 04:06.767
Mr. Butlertron,
my robot butler,

04:06.767 --> 04:08.967
were you aware that there's
a secret association

04:08.967 --> 04:11.733
consisting of both
parents and teachers

04:11.733 --> 04:14.900
manipulating events
behind my back?

04:14.900 --> 04:18.433
Are you referring
to the PTA?

04:18.433 --> 04:20.900
So you do know!

04:20.900 --> 04:23.800
Any group that controls
this many fonts

04:23.800 --> 04:26.500
and is bold enough to use

04:26.500 --> 04:28.567
all these exclamation marks

04:28.567 --> 04:30.333
must be incredibly powerful!

04:30.333 --> 04:35.300
And soon, in fact, this Thursday
in the cafetorium,

04:35.300 --> 04:38.467
I shall become their leader!

inhale some dried fruit.

04:53.900 --> 04:55.167
No.

04:55.167 --> 04:57.067
The only thing Gandhi and I
will be inhaling

04:57.067 --> 04:59.833
is a little drug
called abstinence.

04:59.833 --> 05:03.133
And no amount of peer pressure
will change our minds.

05:03.133 --> 05:04.800
Wow, I'm accepted.

I am here to take you
on a magical journey

05:23.733 --> 05:25.333
into your subconscious.

05:25.333 --> 05:26.600
What are you?

05:26.600 --> 05:28.867
I am a humkeycorn--

05:28.867 --> 05:31.567
half hummingbird,
half donkey,

05:31.567 --> 05:33.933
and half unicorn.

05:33.933 --> 05:36.833
Eat this magic trail mix
so we can begin our quest.

A donkey and a hummingbird
doin' it?

I hope your mom
wasn't the hummingbird!

05:42.733 --> 05:44.867
Just eat the damn trail mix,
Gandhi.

05:47.067 --> 05:49.367
Wow, I'm shrinking!

05:49.367 --> 05:52.933
And somehow my clothes are also
shrinking in proportion!

05:52.933 --> 05:55.467
And my voice is getting higher
in proportion to the shrinkage

05:55.467 --> 05:56.900
of my clothes and my body!

05:56.900 --> 06:03.333
Now grab on to my horn,
and away we go!

06:03.333 --> 06:07.233
Uh, Gandhi, would you mind
eating just a little more

06:07.233 --> 06:09.233
magic trail mix?

06:09.233 --> 06:14.067
I don't mean to be difficult,
but I recently had back surgery.

06:14.067 --> 06:16.467
Abe, I hear
when you're high on raisins,

06:16.467 --> 06:19.633
first and a half base
is amazing.

06:19.633 --> 06:22.500
Under the shirt,
over the bra?

06:22.500 --> 06:24.167
Yes.

06:24.167 --> 06:25.700
Everybody's doin' it.

06:25.700 --> 06:27.233
Give in to peer pressure.

06:27.233 --> 06:28.400
Don't be a wussy.

06:28.400 --> 06:30.300
What's it gonna be, Abe?

06:30.300 --> 06:33.367
What's it gonna be?

06:37.733 --> 06:39.500
(Cleopatra)
What's it gonna be, Abe?

06:39.500 --> 06:42.233
Hand me that raisin doobie.

06:51.067 --> 06:53.067
Huh.
I don't really feel anything.

06:53.067 --> 06:54.500
Well, I have a strong
constitution,

06:54.500 --> 06:55.533
so I don't really--

whack!

07:48.133 --> 07:49.400
What happened, Abe?

07:49.400 --> 07:50.667
Why didn't you just tell them
you were high

07:50.667 --> 07:52.767
on your mother's love
like we rehearsed?

07:52.767 --> 07:54.400
I did, Joan.

07:54.400 --> 07:56.400
But fortunately,
I have real friends

07:56.400 --> 07:58.233
who kept pressuring me
until I understood

07:58.233 --> 08:01.400
the fantastical truth
about raisins.

08:01.400 --> 08:02.400
Oof!

08:02.400 --> 08:03.900
You've changed, Abe.

08:03.900 --> 08:05.667
Well, maybe
everything's changed,

08:05.667 --> 08:07.367
only you haven't changed,

08:07.367 --> 08:10.667
so you're the one who's changed,
because it's all relative!

08:10.667 --> 08:11.667
Hmm?

08:11.667 --> 08:12.933
Hmm.

08:12.933 --> 08:15.200
Gandhi, the first stage
of your journey

08:15.200 --> 08:17.867
is to find
the magic amulet of Balthazul.

08:17.867 --> 08:20.067
It will lead you
to a beautiful princess

08:20.067 --> 08:22.200

I mean the--

08:46.867 --> 08:48.800
Get off my back!

08:48.800 --> 08:51.833
Your mother found these
in your pants, Smokey!

08:51.833 --> 08:53.100
Those weren't
for smoking.

08:53.100 --> 08:54.833
They're just a project
for school.

08:54.833 --> 08:56.900
They were Gandhi's.
I was holding them for him.

08:56.900 --> 08:58.467
I've never seen those before
in my life.

08:58.467 --> 08:59.700
You're the one holding raisins.

08:59.700 --> 09:01.300
I should ask
where you got them.

09:01.300 --> 09:02.300
What are raisins?

09:02.300 --> 09:03.400
From you, okay?

09:03.400 --> 09:04.833
I learned it
from watching you!

09:08.800 --> 09:11.100
Oh, tree, I wish
you had some idea

09:11.100 --> 09:13.100
how to solve
the raisin problem.

I got something that'll make

10:16.900 --> 10:18.767
* I'm the smoke-screen,
have-a-dream pusher *

10:18.767 --> 10:21.100
* I'm the booty-pokin',
raisin-smokin' pusher *

10:21.100 --> 10:24.567
* And in summary,
I'm the pusher *

10:24.567 --> 10:28.033
*

10:29.533 --> 10:31.233
So how many scoops?

10:31.233 --> 10:34.200
How many do you got?

10:34.200 --> 10:37.567
[echoing]
Hello!

10:37.567 --> 10:40.667
[robotic voice]
We've been expecting you,
Gandhi.

10:40.667 --> 10:41.833
Whoa!

10:41.833 --> 10:43.033
It is I,

10:43.033 --> 10:46.400
Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen.

10:46.400 --> 10:50.867
Oh, my God!
You guys got so hot!

10:50.867 --> 10:52.933
You used to be,
like, troll babies,

10:52.933 --> 10:54.800
but, you know,
I never gave up hope.

10:54.800 --> 10:58.233
All our gold and riches
are now yours...

10:58.233 --> 11:00.067
except that amulet.

11:00.067 --> 11:02.467
It was given to me
by Dave Coulier,

11:02.467 --> 11:05.933
a dear friend.

11:05.933 --> 11:07.567
Actually, you can have it.

11:07.567 --> 11:11.067
Wow, this is the amulet
that Geldhemoor spoke of.

11:11.067 --> 11:13.733
And there's an inscription
on the bottom.

11:13.733 --> 11:16.867
"Cut it out."

11:16.867 --> 11:20.967
Journey to the Castle Fusilor
and defeat the terrible dragon,

11:20.967 --> 11:23.300
he who is called
Daniel Feldspar,

11:23.300 --> 11:25.600
and save
the Princess Gremulon,

11:25.600 --> 11:29.833
she who is descended from
the great Rivinojaneelankavil.

11:29.833 --> 11:31.267
And?

11:31.267 --> 11:35.833
Save the princess, Gandhi,
and she will thrice lay you.

11:35.833 --> 11:39.133
Like your clonefather,
the original Gandhi,

11:39.133 --> 11:42.767
your quiet strength
shall lead us to redemption.

11:44.200 --> 11:47.667
Yow!
Thrice laid! Ha-ha!

11:47.667 --> 11:51.267
We found raisins
in Abe's pockets,

11:51.267 --> 11:53.067
but he said
they were Gandhi's.

11:53.067 --> 11:55.333
Our Gandhi
would never do drugs.

11:55.333 --> 11:58.267
In an unrelated story,
he's been missing for four days.

11:58.267 --> 12:00.700
People!

12:00.700 --> 12:04.400
Raisins are a gateway fruit.

12:04.400 --> 12:07.133
Now, I'm on the fence
about this.

12:07.133 --> 12:09.867
What if there were some way
we could fence them

12:09.867 --> 12:13.600
from the dangers and offenses
of the world?

12:13.600 --> 12:15.533
How about--
oh, I don't know--

12:15.533 --> 12:17.133
a fence?

12:17.133 --> 12:19.500
And I shall exploit
this organization's power

12:19.500 --> 12:20.600
to build it...

12:20.600 --> 12:22.600
as your new king,

12:22.600 --> 12:26.467
King Scudworth
the Lionhearted!

12:26.467 --> 12:28.667
Actually, we're governed
by a volunteer committee

12:28.667 --> 12:29.667
that serves--

12:29.667 --> 12:31.333
I said king!

12:31.333 --> 12:35.267
It's like
the "civilized" world

12:35.267 --> 12:38.200
doesn't understand us
and our self-importance.

12:38.200 --> 12:39.400
Yeah.

12:39.400 --> 12:42.467
It's like,
first and a half base...

12:42.467 --> 12:44.500
we should totally just go there,

12:44.500 --> 12:46.067
just to show them.

12:46.067 --> 12:47.067
[chuckles]

12:47.067 --> 12:49.067
Did you bring protection?

12:52.133 --> 12:56.467
Hop aboard Sergeant JFK's
magical mystery tour!

12:56.467 --> 12:59.533
Uh, Cleo and I are kind of
having a celestial moment.

12:59.533 --> 13:01.400
And so am I.

13:01.400 --> 13:03.500
The moon is chasing me.

13:03.500 --> 13:05.733
Everywhere I go,
there he is.

13:05.733 --> 13:07.367
Knock it off, moon!

13:07.367 --> 13:09.400
I'm coming up there!

13:10.533 --> 13:11.833

It is I, Daniel Feldspar,

14:54.867 --> 14:56.800
a stereotypically
Australian dragon.

14:56.800 --> 14:58.867
I'm gonna eat you
like a dingo eats his baby.

Oi! Oi! Oi!

Shrimp on a barbie...

15:03.400 --> 15:05.067
This quest is too hard.

15:06.800 --> 15:08.467
[gasps]
Hey, dragon!

15:08.467 --> 15:10.467
I'm thinking about going
on a hunger strike,

15:10.467 --> 15:12.467
but I've never
tried Vegemite.

15:12.467 --> 15:14.733
Never tried Vegemite?

Wait here.

Closer than you think, Gandhi.

15:32.467 --> 15:34.133
Use the amulet.

[choral singing]

15:40.133 --> 15:43.733

15:43.733 --> 15:47.067
As reward for your bravery
and leadership,

15:47.067 --> 15:49.467
I shall thrice lay you.

15:50.533 --> 15:53.700
Uh...that's cool.

But...I'm good.

But--but I shall
thrice lay you.

15:59.767 --> 16:01.367
Um...I just ate,

16:01.367 --> 16:04.233
and they say
that you shouldn't lay thrice,

16:04.233 --> 16:06.067
uh, after eating.

16:06.067 --> 16:07.733
Uh, thank you.

a big deal.

Oh, okay.

All right.
That's fine.

anyway.

16:25.067 --> 16:28.833
thanks for the trippy adventure
through my subconscious.

16:28.833 --> 16:29.833
I'll call you.

16:29.833 --> 16:30.967
Okay, great.

16:30.967 --> 16:34.367
You know, maybe we could,
uh, hang out

16:34.367 --> 16:35.400
but, you know, not...

16:35.400 --> 16:36.467
Sure, sometime, maybe.

16:36.467 --> 16:37.500
Not lay.

16:37.500 --> 16:38.500
Whatever.

16:38.500 --> 16:39.733
Just hang.

Now that authority figures
are doing it,

it doesn't seem
so rebellious.

20:06.300 --> 20:08.867
Let's smoke crack
instead.

No!

are the Backstreet Boys.

The point is,

to attract teens.

Do you mean to say

20:42.267 --> 20:45.333
smoking raisins
doesn't really get you high?

20:45.333 --> 20:46.733
That's right.

20:53.867 --> 20:55.567
Who wants Vegemite?

20:55.567 --> 20:59.467
(male narrator)
Next time,
on a very special Clone High...

20:59.467 --> 21:02.233
one of the clones
will be horribly killed.

21:02.233 --> 21:04.300
[whispering]
My money's on Abe.

21:04.300 --> 21:06.667
(Abandoned Pools singing)
* Way back in the 1980s

21:06.667 --> 21:09.700
* Secret government
employees *

21:09.700 --> 21:12.533
* Dug up famous
guys and ladies *

21:12.533 --> 21:15.600
* And made amusing
genetic copies *

21:15.600 --> 21:18.500
* Now the clones
are sexy teens now *

21:18.500 --> 21:21.467
* They're gonna make
it if they try *

21:21.467 --> 21:24.333
* Loving, learning,
sharing, judging *

21:24.333 --> 21:30.567
* Time to laugh and
shiver and cry *

21:30.567 --> 21:33.733
* Clone High
