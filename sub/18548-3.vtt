00:35.810 --> 00:37.199
Hello?

00:40.179 --> 00:41.779
Is anyone there?

01:40.836 --> 01:46.703
Now. Following the repeal of
England's 1736 Witchcraft Act,

01:47.070 --> 01:50.140
Pagans are literally
coming out of the woods.

01:50.640 --> 01:53.360
Sorry, sorry. Sorry.

01:53.400 --> 01:57.280
One such is Eugene Bone,

01:57.320 --> 02:01.040
self-styled High Priest of
Crows Coven in Kembleford.

02:02.085 --> 02:04.964
Named and shamed.

02:05.200 --> 02:06.480
Indeed we are.

02:07.960 --> 02:11.840
Mr Bone denies that the covens
are an excuse for...

02:14.920 --> 02:18.479
This is hardly suitable for
a young lady's ears.

02:18.480 --> 02:23.200
Oh! Don't stop on my account,
Reverend Allsworthy.

02:23.240 --> 02:25.800
Yes. Um...

02:30.560 --> 02:37.039
Um... Mr Bone denies the covens
are an excuse for... sexual orgies,

02:37.040 --> 02:42.480
claiming, "We merely drink and dance
and work a little magic."

02:43.960 --> 02:48.879
However, when challenged,
the... warlock admitted that

02:48.880 --> 02:54.840
these ceremonies are performed
sky clad which is to say... naked.

02:54.880 --> 02:58.120
Well! It sounds rather liberating.

02:58.160 --> 03:01.479
Nakedness is a sin.
But not a crime.

03:01.480 --> 03:04.240
Think of the Germans
with their Freikorperkultur.

03:04.280 --> 03:05.880
We don't want their sort in
our village.

03:05.920 --> 03:07.519
Witches or Germans?

03:07.520 --> 03:09.400
Either. Sorcerers...

03:11.160 --> 03:13.119
..doing the devil's work.

03:13.120 --> 03:15.800
You're confusing them
with Satanists.

03:15.840 --> 03:19.279
Witchcraft is a spiritual path,

03:19.280 --> 03:22.680
which is rooted in nature
and the cycle of the seasons.

03:22.720 --> 03:26.160
They tarnish our reputation
and endanger our flocks.

03:26.200 --> 03:32.600
Which is why the Council has asked
that we clergy form a committee

03:32.640 --> 03:36.320
to report back on the moral threat.

03:36.360 --> 03:38.960
I assume we can count on
your support?

03:40.840 --> 03:46.280
You can assume that I intend to see
for myself before I pass sentence.

03:46.320 --> 03:51.360
And I suspect that I will find
we have nothing to fear.

03:58.080 --> 04:01.120
Hey! Come on, she's here! Run!

04:01.160 --> 04:04.039
Ha-ha! Mad witch!
For goodness' sake.

04:12.520 --> 04:13.560
Eugene!

04:15.960 --> 04:19.399
Eugene. There's graffiti
all over the wall.

04:19.399 --> 04:21.159
Although why on earth
I should be surprised

04:21.160 --> 04:24.240
when you persist in exposing us
to the world.

04:24.280 --> 04:26.280
We no longer have to hide
in the dark.

04:26.320 --> 04:28.199
Nor in the full glare of publicity.

04:28.200 --> 04:30.039
The shopkeeper could barely look me
in the eye.

04:30.040 --> 04:32.360
You chastise me for evangelising?

04:32.400 --> 04:34.839
You evangelise yourself, Eugene.

04:34.840 --> 04:38.160
And if you think self-aggrandisement
will allay prejudice,

04:38.200 --> 04:39.720
you're a bigger old fool than...

04:41.560 --> 04:45.560
We have visitors.
I somehow doubt they'll be friendly.

04:51.720 --> 04:53.040
Selina Crow?

04:54.320 --> 04:55.839
Yes.

04:55.840 --> 04:58.599
Father Brown and Mrs McCarthy from
St Mary's

04:58.600 --> 05:00.320
and this is Miss Windermere.

05:00.360 --> 05:01.919
Friend of St Mary's Church.

05:01.920 --> 05:04.680
Are you here to burn us
at the stake?

05:04.720 --> 05:06.920
We're here to invite you to dinner.

05:08.560 --> 05:13.599
Friday is St John's Eve, which
coincides with your summer solstice.

05:13.600 --> 05:14.919
Litha.

05:14.920 --> 05:20.320
We celebrate the marriage of the God
and Goddess and the union

05:20.360 --> 05:22.440
that creates the harvest fruits.

05:22.480 --> 05:26.520
We celebrate the birth of St John,
and traditionally,

05:26.560 --> 05:30.759
locally, it's a time when we welcome
newcomers into the community.

05:30.760 --> 05:33.919
Back in the day, people laid tables
outside their houses

05:33.920 --> 05:35.960
and all were invited.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.639
We, of course, will be eating
in the dining room.

05:39.640 --> 05:44.439
You're asking us to
a Christian feast?

05:44.440 --> 05:46.359
Think of it more as a knees-up.

05:46.360 --> 05:49.240
Trust me, they're in short supply
round here.

05:49.280 --> 05:53.640
Let's not dwell on our differences,
but embrace our similarities.

05:53.680 --> 05:56.480
Eat, drink and be merry together.

06:24.160 --> 06:27.399
Hail! Hail! Hail!

06:27.400 --> 06:32.640
O, Lord of Nature and the Hunt,
be with us this night.

06:32.680 --> 06:35.080
Hail! Hail!

06:35.120 --> 06:38.839
Hail! Hail!

06:38.840 --> 06:44.239
O Ancient One, join us,
O Horned One, join us,

06:44.240 --> 06:47.800
Lord of the Greenwood,
Lord of the Wild,

06:47.840 --> 06:51.520
Consort of the Goddess, join us.

06:53.800 --> 06:56.000
O Goddess, your servant calls you.

06:56.040 --> 07:00.239
O Horned one, join us.

07:00.240 --> 07:04.120
Are you ready to suffer
to be purified?

07:04.160 --> 07:07.440
Consort of the Goddess, join us.

07:09.040 --> 07:14.200
You are about to enter a place
beyond imagining...

07:20.000 --> 07:22.560
..where joy and pain...

07:24.440 --> 07:27.560
..meet and make one.

07:39.200 --> 07:42.520
I'm teeing off at noon
so this had better be good.

07:43.760 --> 07:45.520
Reported murder, sir.

07:45.560 --> 07:48.120
Witness came in first thing
this morning and made a statement.

07:48.160 --> 07:51.360
Milk and three sugars,
and don't forget the garibaldis.

07:57.800 --> 08:01.400
You haul me in on my day off
to investigate

08:01.440 --> 08:04.199
"ritual sacrifice of
a dusky slave maiden",

08:04.200 --> 08:07.280
as reported by the village soak.

08:08.560 --> 08:10.240
I thought you'd like to know, sir.

08:10.280 --> 08:15.640
Which only goes to show how little
you know me at all, sergeant.

08:19.920 --> 08:24.160
You'd have us sup
at the devil's table?

08:25.240 --> 08:28.800
St Peter tells us to give
hospitality without complaint.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.600
I'd have us set an example.

08:32.640 --> 08:35.320
You did hear what happened
last night?

08:35.360 --> 08:38.159
And last week Goggles Malone
said he saw

08:38.200 --> 08:40.240
a flying saucer over
the village hall.

08:43.080 --> 08:45.080
Perhaps the witches
curdled the milk?

08:45.120 --> 08:50.360
My domestic arrangements
leave something to be desired.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.839
You lost your wife in the Blitz.

08:53.840 --> 08:55.240
Wife...

08:56.760 --> 08:59.280
..daughter,

08:59.320 --> 09:03.760
church and a quarter of my parish.

09:03.800 --> 09:05.760
I'm sorry.

09:05.800 --> 09:10.880
My elders sent me here
to escape the evil,

09:10.920 --> 09:13.240
only for the evil to follow me.

09:14.600 --> 09:17.599
They worship other gods.

09:17.600 --> 09:19.080
It doesn't make them evil.

09:22.080 --> 09:25.000
What's with the tree jewellery?

09:25.040 --> 09:28.479
Charms against evil.
This is witches' land.

09:28.480 --> 09:30.880
Witches' land?

09:30.920 --> 09:32.480
Has been for centuries.

09:32.520 --> 09:36.040
Selina Crow inherited the cottage
and these woods

09:36.080 --> 09:37.880
from her aunt, Kathleen Crow.

09:37.920 --> 09:39.920
Was this aunt also a witch?

09:39.960 --> 09:43.680
So it was said. But she kept herself
to herself. Not like this lot.

09:45.240 --> 09:46.440
What was that?

09:46.480 --> 09:50.039
That, sergeant, was the sound of
a wild goose.

09:50.040 --> 09:52.520
You don't believe in witches, sir?

09:52.560 --> 09:55.399
I'm a city boy, born and bred.
We didn't have witches.

09:55.400 --> 09:57.160
Maybe it's the lack of woods.

10:19.080 --> 10:20.720
I don't like the look of it, sir.

10:20.760 --> 10:23.239
Bad taste isn't a crime.

10:23.240 --> 10:27.040
And there's no sign of ritual
human sacrifice.

10:27.080 --> 10:31.120
So I vote we leave so I can salvage
the remnants of my day off.

10:31.160 --> 10:33.559
You got something planned
with the wife and kids later, sir?

10:33.560 --> 10:36.160
Keeping as far away from them
as possible.

10:36.200 --> 10:37.200
Sir!

10:38.640 --> 10:39.840
What now?

10:48.200 --> 10:49.200
Blood, sir.

10:54.320 --> 10:57.000
How did you get on, Father?

10:57.040 --> 10:59.599
I think we face an uphill struggle.

10:59.600 --> 11:01.680
People fear
what they do not understand.

11:01.720 --> 11:03.840
You surprise me, Mrs McCarthy.

11:03.880 --> 11:07.319
Never had you down for open-minded.

11:07.320 --> 11:10.679
Mrs McCarthy's grandmother
was a wise woman.

11:10.680 --> 11:13.040
What you would call a white witch.

11:13.080 --> 11:16.200
People came from the four corners
for her remedies.

11:16.240 --> 11:19.280
But you'd still find her at Mass
on a Sunday.

11:19.320 --> 11:23.440
Mrs McCarthy's grandmother was
a witch? What delicious irony.

11:23.480 --> 11:25.000
Oh!

11:27.640 --> 11:31.800
Talking of delicious,
what's on the menu, Mrs M?

11:31.840 --> 11:36.440
Wild mushroom soup,
roast lamb and my summer pudding.

11:36.480 --> 11:39.160
Well, we certainly put on
a good spread.

11:39.200 --> 11:40.720
We?

11:40.760 --> 11:44.240
Best left to the professionals,
isn't that right, Father?

11:45.880 --> 11:49.120
I think that's wisest. No,
she doesn't get off that lightly!

11:50.560 --> 11:51.959
Here you are, madam.

11:51.960 --> 11:54.800
I need three pounds of
wild mushrooms for my soup.

11:56.040 --> 11:59.040
I take it you do know
what a wild mushroom looks like?

11:59.080 --> 12:00.960
Oh, ye of little faith.

12:03.800 --> 12:06.760
Bone, Eugene.

12:06.800 --> 12:09.200
Crow, Selina.

12:10.040 --> 12:12.480
You aren't, I take it, man and wife?

12:12.520 --> 12:16.960
We're handfasted.
Our union blessed by the Goddess.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.760
Bound in body and soul.

12:22.320 --> 12:23.400
No.

12:25.080 --> 12:28.040
I'd be obliged if you could account
for your whereabouts last night.

12:28.080 --> 12:32.760
We celebrated the summer solstice
with our coveners.

12:32.800 --> 12:34.839
And this celebration
took place where?

12:34.840 --> 12:37.240
At our place of worship.

12:37.280 --> 12:41.039
That would be in Crows Wood?
Yes. Why do you ask?

12:41.040 --> 12:45.600
Describe to me what happened
at this... celebration.

12:47.040 --> 12:49.040
The usual.

12:49.080 --> 12:53.120
We drank and danced,

12:53.160 --> 12:55.520
and worked some magic.

12:56.960 --> 13:02.200
Can I ask what the usual dress code
is for this sort of occasion?

13:02.240 --> 13:07.240
The traditional witch's costume -
that is to say, the skin.

13:09.600 --> 13:11.560
Naked.

13:11.600 --> 13:13.559
Can I ask what this is about?

13:13.560 --> 13:16.080
The alleged assault
of a young woman last night.

13:16.120 --> 13:20.680
Early 20s, dusky skinned,
which makes her easy to identify.

13:20.720 --> 13:23.360
We don't get a lot of exotics
in Kembleford.

13:23.400 --> 13:26.040
Then I imagine
you are looking for me.

13:37.120 --> 13:38.560
Hello?

13:50.640 --> 13:53.159
Oh!

13:53.160 --> 13:56.279
Reverend Allsworthy.
What are you doing here?

13:56.280 --> 13:59.799
Um... I was just taking a walk.

13:59.800 --> 14:01.520
Great minds, it seems.

14:01.560 --> 14:04.599
Hardly. I'm on a fungi hunt.

14:04.600 --> 14:07.720
And they are elusive little beasts.

14:07.760 --> 14:11.400
Oh, well, perhaps you need a knight
to aid you in your quest.

14:13.960 --> 14:15.799
Dione Moon.

14:15.800 --> 14:21.680
D-I-O-N-E.

14:23.640 --> 14:28.439
M-O-O-N.

14:28.440 --> 14:33.040
Thank you, Miss Moon. And you were
at this gathering last night?

14:33.080 --> 14:34.959
It was my initiation.

14:34.960 --> 14:38.040
In the presence of the Goddess,
Guardians,

14:38.080 --> 14:41.960
mighty dead and brothers and sisters
of the Craft.

14:42.000 --> 14:47.000
As the subject of these allegations,
we'd be grateful if you share them.

14:47.040 --> 14:50.119
A reported assault with a whip.

14:50.120 --> 14:53.079
Ritual flagellation.

14:53.080 --> 14:58.439
We suffer in order to learn
and be purified.

14:58.440 --> 15:03.319
And a man in a ram's head
committing an attack with a sword.

15:03.320 --> 15:05.359
The High Priest's sword.

15:05.360 --> 15:10.400
Used to cut the clothes from
the initiate.

15:10.440 --> 15:12.439
Man to woman.

15:12.440 --> 15:14.280
Woman to man.

15:16.720 --> 15:21.599
Can you explain why we found blood
on the floor?

15:21.600 --> 15:26.199
My offering of the essence of life
to the deities.

15:26.200 --> 15:29.120
Fortunately,
a few drops are usually sufficient.

15:29.160 --> 15:32.359
So you claim you were unharmed?

15:32.360 --> 15:34.960
I can prove it, if you like.

15:35.000 --> 15:38.359
Ritual scourging transcends us
to a higher place -

15:38.360 --> 15:42.119
inflicts pain without damage.

15:42.120 --> 15:44.960
Would you like a closer look,
inspector?

15:47.440 --> 15:49.400
I think we've seen enough,
thank you.

15:54.720 --> 15:57.759
"Trees which are good for
mushroom hunting include

15:57.760 --> 16:00.959
"beech, oak, birch and pine."

16:00.960 --> 16:04.040
Do you know your beech from
your birches, Reverend Allsworthy?

16:04.080 --> 16:07.080
I wonder if you would mind
a word of advice?

16:07.120 --> 16:08.799
Fire away.

16:08.800 --> 16:11.960
I'd have more luck searching for
the Scarlett Pimpernel.

16:13.840 --> 16:17.200
You are young
and, dare I say, sheltered.

16:17.240 --> 16:21.640
This dinner of Father Brown's,
it's highly inappropriate.

16:21.680 --> 16:23.880
I take people as I find them.

16:23.920 --> 16:28.239
And aside from being partially clothed,
I found them to be perfectly charming.

16:28.240 --> 16:30.600
Well, it is they
who have charmed you.

16:30.640 --> 16:32.680
And I fear they aren't
the only ones.

16:32.720 --> 16:37.279
Father Brown is...
He's well-meaning.

16:37.280 --> 16:40.119
But hardly someone to look to
for moral guidance.

16:40.120 --> 16:43.440
There are things about him
I doubt you're aware of.

16:43.480 --> 16:45.640
I feel as though
you're about to enlighten me.

16:45.680 --> 16:48.080
He has a reputation as
a trouble seeker.

16:48.120 --> 16:50.679
I believe the police find him
very tiresome

16:50.680 --> 16:54.400
and his bishop is just waiting for
an opportunity to have him...

16:54.440 --> 16:55.840
Oops-a-daisy.

16:57.080 --> 16:58.600
I'm stuck on a root.

17:00.160 --> 17:01.720
Would you give me a hand?

17:04.000 --> 17:05.599
I think you already have one.

17:13.480 --> 17:14.920
Kembleford Police Station.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.880
Can you give me a precise location?

17:22.880 --> 17:26.200
Yeah. Well, don't touch anything.

17:26.240 --> 17:28.600
I'll get reinforcements to you
as soon as possible.

17:30.200 --> 17:32.879
I'll leave you to write up
the report. Adios, sergeant.

17:32.880 --> 17:34.200
Sir, wait!

17:36.280 --> 17:38.120
A body's been found up at
Crows Wood.

17:40.360 --> 17:42.320
Could this day get any better?

17:58.600 --> 18:00.639
What were you doing in Crows Wood?

18:00.640 --> 18:03.280
We were taking a walk.
Looking for mushrooms.

18:03.320 --> 18:06.879
When you found the body,
did you disturb anything?

18:06.880 --> 18:09.160
No. Yes.

18:09.200 --> 18:11.400
Can't you see Miss Windermere
is traumatised?

18:13.240 --> 18:15.040
Reverend, oh, take a pew.

18:16.640 --> 18:19.520
Step aside, Padre,
your work here is done.

18:28.320 --> 18:31.919
Female.
20s to 30s judging by the clothes.

18:31.920 --> 18:34.360
Jewellery,
so we can rule out robbery.

18:35.760 --> 18:39.519
Garments undisturbed
so ditto sexual motive.

18:39.520 --> 18:43.320
Looks like her skull was
crushed with a blunt object.

18:48.520 --> 18:52.359
Query stone.
Date of death is anyone's guess.

18:52.360 --> 18:54.280
Is the police surgeon on his way?

18:54.320 --> 18:56.719
He is, sir, yes. Er...

18:56.720 --> 18:59.559
Some time in March
would be my guess.

18:59.560 --> 19:01.960
Oh, pray, do enlighten us.

19:04.240 --> 19:07.679
Well, the soles of the shoes
are covered in bluebell leaves

19:07.680 --> 19:11.320
which appear in March
but no sign of the flowers,

19:11.360 --> 19:16.400
which bloomed in the second week
in April, as I recall.

19:17.720 --> 19:22.480
And... I also found this.

19:25.560 --> 19:28.160
Removal of evidence.

19:28.200 --> 19:31.840
I was about to give it to
the sergeant when you appeared.

19:31.880 --> 19:33.280
I suppose you've had a good snoop?

19:33.320 --> 19:35.480
Curiosity is not a crime.

19:35.520 --> 19:38.120
More's the pity or you'd be serving
life without probation.

19:39.560 --> 19:42.600
Shopping lists
and household accounts.

19:42.640 --> 19:45.400
Er... have you seen the last entry?

19:54.840 --> 19:57.640
Now I suppose you're going
to tell us what it means.

19:57.680 --> 19:58.840
I have no idea.

19:58.880 --> 20:00.240
What a refreshing change.

20:00.280 --> 20:03.720
At least there'll be something for
the police to investigate.

20:03.760 --> 20:06.440
What's that round her wrist, sir?

20:08.880 --> 20:11.039
Some sort of restraint?

20:11.040 --> 20:12.320
It's a rowan cross.

20:13.920 --> 20:18.840
"Rowan tree and red thread
will tyne the witches speed."

20:18.880 --> 20:21.839
Oh, riddle-de-dee.
In English, please.

20:21.840 --> 20:25.520
It's a charm. Against witchcraft.

20:34.120 --> 20:37.240
Reverend Gillespie and
Reverend Allsworthy are here, sir.

20:37.280 --> 20:38.440
Get rid of them.

20:38.480 --> 20:41.759
I need more pesky priests
like a hole in the head.

20:41.760 --> 20:44.560
Reverend Gillespie and
Reverend Allsworthy are HERE, sir.

20:48.040 --> 20:51.240
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
What can I do for you?

20:51.280 --> 20:54.320
This body in the woods
is causing a lot of unsettlement.

20:54.360 --> 20:58.119
It's early days.
We've yet to identify the victim.

20:58.120 --> 21:00.680
There's speculation
it's the Potter girl.

21:02.840 --> 21:06.280
Dolly Potter, sir.
Person reported missing at Easter?

21:07.960 --> 21:10.960
Dorothy Potter. 23.
Bit of a tearaway.

21:11.000 --> 21:14.400
No suspicious circumstances,
ditto evidence of foul play.

21:14.440 --> 21:15.800
Case was closed.

21:15.840 --> 21:19.480
She only lived a mile
from that godforsaken place.

21:19.520 --> 21:22.320
And given what Goggles Malone saw...

21:22.360 --> 21:25.039
Mr Malone's allegation
was investigated

21:25.040 --> 21:27.200
and found to be unsubstantiated.

21:27.240 --> 21:28.920
Not quite, sir.

21:32.840 --> 21:37.760
I stand corrected. Found to be
down to misinterpretation.

21:37.800 --> 21:40.679
So if you'll excuse me,
my sergeant here will show you out,

21:40.680 --> 21:43.479
allowing me to get on with
my enquiries.

21:43.480 --> 21:44.840
This way, gentlemen.

21:52.240 --> 21:55.440
So you didn't manage to bring back
a single mushroom?

21:55.480 --> 21:59.720
You do know, of course,
that mushrooms are best picked at daybreak.

21:59.760 --> 22:03.680
Well, I was rather sidetracked by
the discovery of a rotting corpse.

22:03.720 --> 22:05.680
Yes, well, trust you
to find an excuse.

22:07.160 --> 22:10.480
And you are not going to find
the answer staring at that.

22:10.520 --> 22:13.800
The word in the village is
it's Dolly Potter. Ha!

22:16.400 --> 22:19.439
I appreciate you're not one
to gossip, Mrs McCarthy.

22:19.440 --> 22:21.000
Indeed I'm not.

22:23.040 --> 22:26.400
But I have it on very good authority
that she's alive and well,

22:26.440 --> 22:29.560
and living in sin with a signalman
from Little Bigham.

22:31.440 --> 22:33.200
And?

22:34.560 --> 22:36.839
Pam Tickle saw her
at Moreton-in-Marsh

22:36.840 --> 22:39.320
when she was changing for
the Bristol train.

22:39.360 --> 22:42.439
She dropped into the station cafe
for a cup of tea and a bath bun

22:42.440 --> 22:46.400
and there was Dolly Potter
behind the counter, bold as brass.

22:49.920 --> 22:53.760
Angel and saint rolled into one,
Mrs McCarthy.

22:56.000 --> 22:59.520
The nearest station to
Crows Wood is Great Pickford.

22:59.560 --> 23:02.680
And the 4.17 to Moreton-in-Marsh...

23:03.920 --> 23:07.960
..connects with the 5.03 to
London Paddington arriving 7.19.

23:08.000 --> 23:11.759
GP. MIM. LP.

23:11.760 --> 23:14.040
She was catching a train.

23:14.080 --> 23:15.480
Somehow I doubt that.

23:15.520 --> 23:18.320
What woman would travel from
the back of beyond to London

23:18.360 --> 23:19.920
in the clothes she stood up in?

23:22.560 --> 23:24.039
With me, Bunty.

23:24.040 --> 23:26.280
Where are we going?

23:27.240 --> 23:28.280
Crows Wood.

23:29.920 --> 23:33.360
Well, you might bring me back
some mushrooms while you're there!

23:36.440 --> 23:39.120
You know, this is
a Hundred Acre Wood.

23:39.160 --> 23:42.879
We've as much chance of finding
a bear of very little brain.

23:42.880 --> 23:46.640
And even if she had a bag,
maybe the murderer stole it?

23:46.680 --> 23:48.560
And leave her jewellery?

23:48.600 --> 23:50.359
So why not bury it with the body?

23:50.360 --> 23:55.680
Well, maybe they didn't want
their victim to be identified.

23:55.720 --> 24:00.760
Well, I vote we take a breather
and you pray for a miracle.

24:00.800 --> 24:03.960
God helps those who help themselves,
Penelope.

24:06.120 --> 24:07.240
Father!

24:13.080 --> 24:15.200
The inspector's going to love us.

24:15.240 --> 24:16.720
I somehow doubt it.

24:19.880 --> 24:21.280
Someone packed in a hurry.

24:23.160 --> 24:27.360
Spelling prize 1931.
St John The Baptist Primary School.

24:27.400 --> 24:30.079
"Eruditio et Religio."

24:30.080 --> 24:31.880
So we know she was a good speller.

24:34.120 --> 24:37.920
It also seems she was a witch.

24:41.800 --> 24:43.840
Lilith's.

24:43.880 --> 24:45.679
She's...

24:45.680 --> 24:48.720
she was a member of our coven.

24:48.760 --> 24:51.399
What can you tell me about her?

24:51.400 --> 24:55.039
She was a free spirit.

24:55.040 --> 24:56.800
Her full name would do for starters.

24:56.840 --> 24:59.480
Lilith Lafitte. She was a poet.

25:00.720 --> 25:03.359
Quite well known
in literary circles.

25:03.360 --> 25:05.600
When did you last see her?

25:07.840 --> 25:13.320
The 29th March.
The day after our spring equinox.

25:14.680 --> 25:17.240
And you didn't see or hear from her
after that?

25:19.000 --> 25:22.240
As a member of your coven,
didn't that strike you as unusual?

25:23.880 --> 25:25.280
In your own time.

25:27.240 --> 25:30.720
We had... a difference of opinion.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.400
Go on.

25:33.440 --> 25:35.640
Lilith intended to publish
a Book of Shadows.

25:37.880 --> 25:40.519
What you would call a spell book.

25:40.520 --> 25:43.760
You'd share secret rites with every
Tom, Dick, and Harry

25:43.800 --> 25:45.160
who strays into a bookshop?

25:45.200 --> 25:47.439
They were secret only
when we were forced underground.

25:47.440 --> 25:48.640
Now is our time.

25:48.680 --> 25:50.160
They are not yours to share.

25:50.200 --> 25:52.080
Nor yours to hoard.

25:52.120 --> 25:54.320
It's a new world, Selina.

25:54.360 --> 25:56.520
There's no room in it
for retrogrades.

25:56.560 --> 25:58.800
Then I will not circle with you.

26:00.480 --> 26:03.959
It would have been a tad
melodramatic to throw her out.

26:03.960 --> 26:06.999
She packed her things
and left for the station.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.360
Did anyone see her leave?

26:10.520 --> 26:13.640
Are we to assume
we're under suspicion?

26:13.680 --> 26:16.719
We've ruled out robbery
and sexual motive,

26:16.720 --> 26:20.759
which leaves the possibility
that she knew her killer.

26:20.760 --> 26:25.400
So I'd like you all to account for
your whereabouts at the time.

26:25.440 --> 26:27.440
Eugene took to his bed
with a migraine

26:27.480 --> 26:31.919
so I went to get willow bark
for a remedy.

26:31.920 --> 26:35.040
And would these willows
be in Crows Wood?

26:35.080 --> 26:40.040
By the stream.
Not near where she was found.

26:42.720 --> 26:45.559
Which also leaves you
unaccounted for.

26:45.560 --> 26:47.479
I wasn't alone.

26:47.480 --> 26:49.960
I was with my mentor.

26:53.240 --> 26:55.080
I was giving her instruction.

26:56.600 --> 26:59.720
Giving her... instruction.

27:02.200 --> 27:05.079
Then it would appear that
I alone am without an alibi.

27:05.080 --> 27:08.640
Duly noted, Miss Crow.

27:11.360 --> 27:16.799
Be sober, be vigilant.

27:16.800 --> 27:20.240
For your adversary, the devil...

27:20.280 --> 27:24.720
..as a roaring lion, walketh about,

27:24.760 --> 27:28.239
seeking whom he may devour!

27:28.240 --> 27:32.640
They come into our community,
flaunting heresy.

27:32.680 --> 27:36.159
And while the police
drag their feet,

27:36.160 --> 27:38.120
well, do we lock up our womenfolk?

27:38.160 --> 27:41.999
Or do we protect ourselves? Yes!

27:46.120 --> 27:48.480
Sorry. Excuse me,
it's an emergency.

27:48.520 --> 27:49.800
Mortal at the very least.

27:54.840 --> 27:57.000
A mortal sin, no less?

27:57.040 --> 28:00.040
There's about to be if you don't get
to Crows Corner, statim!

28:12.360 --> 28:15.159
There shall not be found among you

28:15.160 --> 28:19.799
anyone who burns his son
or his daughter as an offering,

28:19.800 --> 28:23.039
anyone who practises divination

28:23.040 --> 28:26.280
or tells fortunes
or interprets omens,

28:26.320 --> 28:31.640
or a sorcerer or a charmer
or a medium or a necromancer

28:31.680 --> 28:35.200
or one who inquires of the dead.

28:35.240 --> 28:37.040
We don't want 'em here!

28:40.920 --> 28:45.440
For whoever does these things
is an abomination.

28:47.640 --> 28:51.319
This is getting out of hand.
An ordered protest, we said.

28:51.320 --> 28:53.439
If they don't leave,
we'll smoke 'em out.

28:53.440 --> 28:57.120
Think what you're doing.
This is all highly illegal!

28:57.160 --> 28:59.160
I insist you stop this immediately.

28:59.200 --> 29:01.360
Burn the witches!

29:04.600 --> 29:07.480
Have you taken leave of your senses?

29:10.360 --> 29:12.399
Shame on you all.

29:12.400 --> 29:16.240
Murderers! They're murderers!

29:16.280 --> 29:18.240
On what evidence?

29:18.280 --> 29:22.680
Who else would murder a black-eyed
witch but one of their own?

29:25.040 --> 29:26.720
Does anyone have evidence?

29:28.760 --> 29:30.320
Shall we have a show of hands?

29:35.760 --> 29:36.960
No-one?

29:39.720 --> 29:42.879
Go home, please, all of you,

29:42.880 --> 29:45.560
before you do something
you cannot undo.

29:52.000 --> 29:56.680
It seems that you are a lone voice
in our defence.

30:00.120 --> 30:02.160
We owe you our gratitude.

30:06.440 --> 30:08.999
She was very striking.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.880
It doesn't do her justice.

30:11.920 --> 30:14.079
She had a hypnotic quality.

30:14.080 --> 30:18.800
Eyes like pools of ink
that could drown you with a stare.

30:18.840 --> 30:22.824
She hypnotised you. Although it didn't take
you long to find a replacement.

30:24.040 --> 30:25.360
A toast.

30:26.960 --> 30:28.520
Lilith.

30:28.560 --> 30:29.960
Lilith. Lilith.

30:32.560 --> 30:36.840
Miss Windermere! Miss Windermere.
Has something happened?

30:36.880 --> 30:38.080
Oh, haven't you heard?

30:38.120 --> 30:40.920
Dragged through a hedge backwards
is quite the look this season.

30:40.960 --> 30:44.399
Either that or a sadistic madwoman
forced me out into the woods

30:44.400 --> 30:46.400
at daybreak gather mushrooms.

30:46.440 --> 30:49.559
Here you are
and I hope you're satisfied.

30:49.560 --> 30:52.520
All this fuss about
a bit of honest dirt.

30:52.560 --> 30:55.960
If you still think of attending
this imprudent gathering,

30:56.000 --> 30:58.400
can I urge you to think of
your reputation?

30:58.440 --> 31:01.759
I think it's a bit late for that.
And the reputation of this village.

31:01.760 --> 31:05.119
Oh, you'd rather it had a reputation
for burning people in their homes?

31:05.120 --> 31:10.160
Last night got out of hand
and was... regrettable.

31:10.200 --> 31:12.200
But what sort of message
is this going to send?

31:12.240 --> 31:14.799
That people are innocent
until proved guilty?

31:14.800 --> 31:18.640
It is you who are the innocent and
know nothing of life's depravities.

31:18.680 --> 31:21.560
You've never spoke a truer word,
Reverend.

31:21.600 --> 31:23.400
Now, what this young lady needs...

31:23.440 --> 31:26.840
You think I need protection,
don't you, Reverend?

31:26.880 --> 31:28.880
It goes without saying.

31:28.920 --> 31:32.159
Oh, well, then, in that case,
I accept.

31:32.160 --> 31:33.960
And if it's frightfully dull,

31:34.000 --> 31:37.439
then I know I can rely on you
for entertaining conversation.

31:37.440 --> 31:39.200
I think you... Yoo-hoo! Minister.

31:39.240 --> 31:42.280
I've just persuaded the reverend
to join us for dinner.

31:42.320 --> 31:43.680
I don't suppose we can tempt you?

31:43.720 --> 31:47.520
Mrs McCarthy is making her infamous
wild mushroom soup.

31:47.560 --> 31:49.600
I think you mean famous.
I know what I meant.

31:49.640 --> 31:52.400
I am late for the African orphans.

31:52.440 --> 31:54.479
So, if you can leave those
at the back door

31:54.480 --> 31:56.280
and I will collect them later.

31:56.320 --> 31:58.840
I think Miss Windermere's
got the wrong end of...

31:58.880 --> 32:01.560
If we're to be dinner companions,
you must call me Penelope.

32:01.600 --> 32:03.200
If I may call you Peter?

32:03.240 --> 32:09.239
The evil spreads, and one by one
they suck you in.

32:09.240 --> 32:12.360
I didn't... I haven't....
So shall I pick you up at seven?

32:21.520 --> 32:24.120
I'm so glad you decided to come.

32:24.160 --> 32:25.440
I'm not here on your behalf.

32:25.480 --> 32:28.960
Oh, cheer up, it's a party.
Of sorts.

32:30.600 --> 32:33.680
It's home-made.
A gift from our guests.

32:35.320 --> 32:37.640
May I ask what's in it?

32:37.680 --> 32:40.719
Oh, eye of newt, bat's wool,
dog's tongue.

32:40.720 --> 32:42.000
Chin-chin.

32:42.040 --> 32:43.759
She's pulling your leg, Reverend.

32:43.760 --> 32:46.879
Of course. It's very... pleasant.

32:46.880 --> 32:50.320
Elderflower and rosehip,
and we're used to preconceptions.

32:50.360 --> 32:53.919
The 15th century
witch hunter's manual,

32:53.920 --> 32:59.199
Malleus Maleficarum, states that
green eyes are the mark of a witch.

32:59.200 --> 33:01.880
And those branded should be dragged
from their homes and hanged.

33:01.920 --> 33:04.239
I say, you'd be toast.

33:04.240 --> 33:05.240
Preposterous.

33:05.280 --> 33:07.360
Now, dinner is served.

33:08.640 --> 33:11.440
So if you'd all like to
find yourselves a seat.

33:11.480 --> 33:13.280
Oh, thank you.

33:19.200 --> 33:23.040
I'm afraid I have to leave.
A parish emergency.

33:23.080 --> 33:26.360
Sick call, an ailing person.

33:26.400 --> 33:28.920
Don't wait for me.
Mrs McCarthy will explain.

33:34.080 --> 33:35.720
Hello?

33:55.560 --> 33:57.760
I hope you don't mind.
I let myself in.

33:57.800 --> 34:00.400
Like you, my door is always open.

34:00.440 --> 34:03.119
Unless this is another attempt

34:03.120 --> 34:07.320
to persuade me
to your infernal gathering.

34:08.960 --> 34:10.839
No.

34:10.840 --> 34:12.960
I'm here about the murdered woman.

34:14.080 --> 34:17.840
I... know nothing of the witch.

34:19.520 --> 34:21.199
She was raised a Methodist.

34:22.159 --> 34:26.199
Her school motto was
Eruditio et Religio

34:26.239 --> 34:28.918
from the hymn by Charles Wesley.

34:28.920 --> 34:32.360
What if she was? I didn't know her.

34:32.400 --> 34:33.998
You knew what she looked like.

34:34.000 --> 34:38.839
Who else would murder a black-eyed
witch but one of their own?

34:38.840 --> 34:41.639
A figure of speech.

34:41.679 --> 34:45.480
Witches' eyes are generally green.
But Lilith's were dark.

34:47.159 --> 34:48.639
Like pools of black ink.

34:50.639 --> 34:51.960
Like your wife's.

34:55.080 --> 34:57.280
I don't see any pictures
of your daughter.

34:58.360 --> 35:02.160
Destroyed... by the Nazis.

35:03.600 --> 35:07.000
I don't think even the Luftwaffe
could be that selective.

35:07.040 --> 35:08.480
My daughter is dead.

35:10.080 --> 35:11.480
What is it to you?

35:13.800 --> 35:16.160
She didn't die in the Blitz.

35:16.200 --> 35:18.200
She transgressed.

35:21.680 --> 35:23.080
Crimes so heinous...

35:27.000 --> 35:29.680
..that her name was struck from
the family Bible.

35:33.040 --> 35:34.400
I can't quite make it out.

35:34.440 --> 35:35.440
Ruth.

35:37.120 --> 35:38.880
Her name was Ruth.

35:41.680 --> 35:46.840
And she was dead to us the minute
she sold her soul to those devils.

35:48.600 --> 35:52.079
'And then ten years later,

35:52.080 --> 35:57.479
'God in his wisdom returned her.

35:57.480 --> 36:02.480
'She was writing a book.
Spreading the evil.'

36:05.160 --> 36:06.640
I prayed.

36:08.000 --> 36:14.880
My God, why do you torment me
by bringing her to this place?

36:14.920 --> 36:19.040
'And then I realised it was a gift.

36:20.800 --> 36:26.800
'He returned my daughter to be
cleansed and restored to the fold.'

36:31.280 --> 36:32.560
She laughed in my face.

36:35.440 --> 36:37.039
Now we're free to spread
our message,

36:37.040 --> 36:39.320
the old religion will again
reign supreme.

36:39.360 --> 36:40.720
You will burn in hell.

36:40.760 --> 36:44.120
There is no hell.
No day of judgment.

36:44.160 --> 36:45.560
And we will not meet again.

36:50.400 --> 36:53.320
Oh, my God, my God...

36:53.360 --> 36:57.959
why hast thou forsaken me?

36:57.960 --> 37:00.360
And then...

37:00.400 --> 37:03.400
his purpose revealed itself.

37:09.600 --> 37:16.039
'A man also and a woman
that hath a familiar spirit,

37:16.040 --> 37:17.440
'or is a wizard...

37:19.080 --> 37:22.080
'..shall surely be put to death.

37:24.200 --> 37:26.560
'They shall stone them with stones.

37:30.000 --> 37:32.400
'Their blood shall be upon them.'

37:38.600 --> 37:40.959
You killed your daughter.

37:40.960 --> 37:42.440
I'm so, so sorry.

37:43.880 --> 37:46.039
I obeyed the word of God.

37:46.040 --> 37:49.359
That is not God's will.

37:49.360 --> 37:50.760
You're blind.

37:52.320 --> 37:56.200
The evil enters like a needle

37:56.240 --> 37:59.520
and spreads like an oak.

38:01.040 --> 38:03.720
The evil is in your mind.

38:05.200 --> 38:10.040
For your own sake, give up this
crusade and seek God's forgiveness.

38:10.080 --> 38:12.480
It's too late.

38:12.520 --> 38:16.320
They're all condemned,

38:16.360 --> 38:20.200
in this life and the next.

38:20.240 --> 38:21.440
What have you done?

38:23.000 --> 38:26.920
I sent angels to destroy them.

38:36.640 --> 38:41.960
Now then. Who'd like to try
some of my wild mushroom soup?

38:45.560 --> 38:49.960
I poisoned evil at the roots.

38:55.600 --> 38:59.039
Paganism gave birth to Christianity.

38:59.040 --> 39:00.640
Bequeathed her festivals.

39:00.680 --> 39:03.880
Easter is named after Eostre,

39:03.920 --> 39:06.920
the great mother goddess
of the Saxons.

39:06.960 --> 39:10.199
I don't think this is appropriate
conversation for the dinner table.

39:10.200 --> 39:12.680
I'd say it's just taken a turn
for the better.

39:13.840 --> 39:15.760
Stop! Don't...

39:17.000 --> 39:18.480
..eat the soup.

39:20.200 --> 39:22.560
Something tells me
this isn't good news.

39:24.640 --> 39:27.199
Gillespie poisoned it with
destroying angels.

39:27.200 --> 39:28.840
What are you talking about?

39:28.880 --> 39:31.639
Deadly mushrooms.
Even half a one is lethal.

39:31.640 --> 39:33.720
Then we must get to a hospital.

39:33.760 --> 39:36.199
There's no antidote
and the damage is done.

39:36.200 --> 39:40.239
I'd say we have a week at most.

39:40.240 --> 39:43.280
But this is not my time.

39:43.320 --> 39:47.520
A week... and one man
I'd spend it with.

39:47.560 --> 39:49.279
Who would you chose?

39:49.280 --> 39:51.639
I'll save him the bother.

39:51.640 --> 39:55.279
You think I want his whingeing to be
the last words I hear on this Earth?

39:55.280 --> 39:57.519
And trust me, he will whinge.

39:57.520 --> 40:00.040
Take him. You have my blessing.

40:02.000 --> 40:05.400
Is there one person
you would spend your last days with?

40:07.280 --> 40:08.799
Marlon Brando.

40:08.800 --> 40:10.680
You joke,

40:10.720 --> 40:16.600
but I have reason to think that
you share my feelings.

40:17.880 --> 40:20.759
Well, your timing
leaves a tad to be desired.

40:20.760 --> 40:22.240
I understand. You're shy.

40:22.280 --> 40:23.359
But time is our enemy.

40:23.360 --> 40:27.360
I'll get a special licence and
at least we can die as man and wife

40:27.400 --> 40:29.240
having been... fulfilled.

40:29.280 --> 40:32.200
What is all this talk of dying?

40:33.680 --> 40:37.799
Gillespie spiked the mushrooms
with fatal fungi.

40:37.800 --> 40:39.720
Did he now?

40:39.760 --> 40:41.760
Then it's a good thing
I didn't use them.

40:43.360 --> 40:44.640
What do you mean?

40:44.680 --> 40:45.999
I threw them away.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.680
Oh, thank the Lord!

40:48.720 --> 40:50.759
We yield thee praise
and thanksgiving...

40:50.760 --> 40:54.559
And these would be the same
mushrooms that you forced me

40:54.560 --> 40:56.680
out into the wood
to gather at daybreak?

40:56.720 --> 40:59.440
I could hardly trust you
not to poison us all.

40:59.480 --> 41:01.880
Even if someone else
hadn't got to them first.

41:01.920 --> 41:03.520
So why make me?

41:04.840 --> 41:08.560
Because I thought it might keep you
out of trouble for a little while.

41:11.400 --> 41:13.760
But if they had stood
in my counsel,

41:13.800 --> 41:16.920
and had caused my people to hear
my words, then that should have

41:16.960 --> 41:19.560
turned them from their evil way,
and the evil of their doings!

41:19.600 --> 41:22.200
Behold the mouthpiece of the Lord!

41:22.240 --> 41:24.440
Neither God nor a jury
will convict me!

41:26.160 --> 41:27.600
He's got that right.

41:27.640 --> 41:29.520
I'll give you 2-1 on the nuthouse.

41:38.800 --> 41:40.959
Oh! Good morning!

41:40.960 --> 41:42.879
Good morning!

41:42.880 --> 41:46.719
I've come to redirect Eugene's mail.

41:46.720 --> 41:49.080
Oh! We heard you'd given him
the heave-ho.

41:51.000 --> 41:54.280
I think what she meant to say was,
"We're sorry about that."

41:54.320 --> 41:57.039
Don't be. She's welcome to him,

41:57.040 --> 42:01.000
his arthritis, his ingrowing
toenails and his wandering eye.

42:01.040 --> 42:04.680
Sometimes men are just more trouble
than they're worth.

42:04.720 --> 42:07.959
Seconded. Time I skedaddled.

42:07.960 --> 42:09.560
You can't dodge him forever.

42:09.600 --> 42:13.000
For heaven's sake,
put the poor man out of his misery.

42:14.440 --> 42:16.680
Very well, I'll do the dirty deed.

42:24.920 --> 42:27.840
You've been avoiding me.
I know why.

42:27.880 --> 42:29.840
You do?

42:29.880 --> 42:33.119
My declaration was sudden
and alarmed you.

42:33.120 --> 42:35.799
Let's just put it down to
the heat of the moment.

42:35.800 --> 42:38.600
And yet I didn't imagine the warmth
between us.

42:40.040 --> 42:44.240
And you still haven't given me
your answer.

42:46.760 --> 42:50.519
Well, the truth is, Reverend...

42:50.520 --> 42:51.960
Peter.

42:52.000 --> 42:53.440
The truth is, Peter...

42:55.880 --> 42:57.880
..I cannot marry outside
of my faith.

42:57.920 --> 42:59.880
I'm Catholic, you're Protestant.

42:59.920 --> 43:03.039
I'm Montague, you're Capulet
and look how well that ended.

43:03.040 --> 43:04.920
It's an obstacle, I admit,
but surely...

43:04.960 --> 43:07.679
As a man of God, you must understand

43:07.680 --> 43:09.040
that, well...

43:11.240 --> 43:14.240
..my faith is stronger
than my feelings for you.

43:15.760 --> 43:18.000
So it's adieu,

43:18.040 --> 43:22.120
with the memory that I will always
cherish of what might have been.
