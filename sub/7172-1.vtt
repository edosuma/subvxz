04:16.505 --> 04:19.925
This is a story
of an ordinary little boy...

04:20.093 --> 04:23.136
...named Charlie Bucket.

04:23.805 --> 04:28.350
He was not faster or stronger
or more clever than other children.

04:30.311 --> 04:35.107
His family was not rich
or powerful or well-connected.

04:35.275 --> 04:39.069
In fact, they barely had enough to eat.

04:40.113 --> 04:44.533
Charlie Bucket was the luckiest boy
in the entire world.

04:44.701 --> 04:47.077
He just didn't know it yet.

05:04.012 --> 05:05.679
- Evening, Buckets.
- Evening.

05:05.847 --> 05:07.306
Hi, Dad.

05:09.392 --> 05:11.643
Soup's almost ready, darling.

05:12.228 --> 05:15.480
Don't suppose there's anything
extra to put in, love.

05:16.274 --> 05:18.942
Oh, well. Nothing goes better
with cabbage than cabbage.

05:23.489 --> 05:24.948
Charlie...

05:25.408 --> 05:27.868
...I found something I think you'll like.

05:31.080 --> 05:35.375
Charlie's father worked
at the local toothpaste factory.

05:35.543 --> 05:39.588
The hours were long,
and the pay was terrible...

05:39.756 --> 05:44.593
...yet occasionally,
there were unexpected surprises.

05:47.096 --> 05:48.597
It's exactly what I need.

05:49.849 --> 05:51.224
What is it, Charlie?

05:57.273 --> 05:59.775
Dad found it, just the piece I needed.

05:59.942 --> 06:02.944
- What piece was it?
- A head for Willy Wonka.

06:03.112 --> 06:04.363
Well, how wonderful.

06:04.530 --> 06:06.573
It's quite a likeness.

06:06.741 --> 06:08.408
You think so?
- Think so?

06:08.576 --> 06:10.160
I know so.

06:10.328 --> 06:13.997
I saw Willy Wonka
with my own two eyes.

06:14.165 --> 06:16.458
- I used to work for him, you know.
- You did?

06:16.626 --> 06:18.168
- I did.
- He did.

06:18.461 --> 06:19.628
He did.

06:19.796 --> 06:21.797
I love grapes.

06:22.131 --> 06:26.343
Of course, I was a much
younger man in those days.

06:27.637 --> 06:32.391
Willy Wonka began with
a single store on Cherry Street.

06:32.600 --> 06:35.852
But the whole world wanted his candy.

06:39.315 --> 06:41.566
- Mr. Wonka.
- Yeah?

06:41.734 --> 06:43.527
We need more Wonka bars...

06:43.694 --> 06:47.531
...and we're out of chocolate birds.
- Birds?

06:47.824 --> 06:49.157
Birds.

06:49.325 --> 06:53.370
Well, then we'll need
to make some more. Here.

06:56.040 --> 06:57.707
Now open.

07:01.838 --> 07:03.964
The man was a genius.

07:04.465 --> 07:08.802
Did you know he invented a new way
of making chocolate ice cream...

07:08.970 --> 07:12.639
...so that it stays cold for hours
without a freezer?

07:12.807 --> 07:17.310
You can even leave it lying in the sun
on a hot day, and it won't go runny.

07:18.187 --> 07:21.356
- But that's impossible.
- But Willy Wonka did it.

07:24.402 --> 07:25.735
Before long...

07:25.903 --> 07:29.448
...he decided to build
a proper chocolate factory.

07:29.615 --> 07:32.701
The largest chocolate factory
in history.

07:32.869 --> 07:36.163
Fifty times as big as any other.

07:55.183 --> 07:56.850
Grandpa, don't make it gross.

07:57.935 --> 08:01.730
Tell him about the Indian prince.
He'd like to hear about that.

08:02.273 --> 08:04.566
You mean, Prince Pondicherry?

08:05.234 --> 08:09.529
Well, Prince Pondicherry
wrote a letter to Mr. Wonka...

08:09.906 --> 08:12.407
...and asked him to come
all the way out to India...

08:12.867 --> 08:17.204
...and build him a colossal palace
entirely out of chocolate.

08:20.416 --> 08:21.875
It will have 100 rooms...

08:22.043 --> 08:26.671
...and everything will be made
of dark or light chocolate.

08:29.717 --> 08:33.135
True to his word,
the bricks were chocolate...

08:33.304 --> 08:36.056
...and the cement holding
them together was chocolate.

08:36.765 --> 08:40.101
All the walls and ceilings
were made of chocolate as well.

08:41.479 --> 08:44.856
So were the carpets
and the pictures and the furniture.

08:45.024 --> 08:47.943
It is perfect in every way.

08:48.110 --> 08:51.238
Yeah, but it won't last long.
You better start eating right now.

08:51.405 --> 08:55.200
Oh, nonsense. I will not eat my palace.

08:55.368 --> 08:58.703
I intend to live in it.

09:01.457 --> 09:03.959
But Mr. Wonka was right, of course.

09:04.627 --> 09:09.798
Soon after this, there came
a very hot day with a boiling sun.

09:11.050 --> 09:13.051
Mmm.

09:46.002 --> 09:50.714
The prince sent an urgent telegram
requesting a new palace...

09:50.881 --> 09:53.675
...but Willy Wonka was facing
problems of his own.

09:55.678 --> 10:00.557
All the other chocolate makers, you see,
had grown jealous of Mr. Wonka.

10:00.725 --> 10:05.520
They began sending in spies
to steal his secret recipes.

10:33.341 --> 10:37.385
Fickelgruber started making
an ice cream that would never melt.

10:37.553 --> 10:41.931
Prodnose came out with a chewing gum
that never lost its flavor.

10:42.099 --> 10:44.893
Then Slugworth
began making candy balloons...

10:45.061 --> 10:48.063
...that you could blow up
to incredible sizes.

10:48.981 --> 10:51.191
The thievery got so bad...

10:51.359 --> 10:53.526
...that one day, without warning...

10:53.694 --> 10:58.239
...Mr. Wonka told every single one
of his workers to go home.

10:58.407 --> 11:03.244
He announced that he was closing
his chocolate factory forever.

11:03.412 --> 11:07.624
I'm closing my chocolate factory
forever.

11:07.792 --> 11:09.084
I'm sorry.

11:25.768 --> 11:28.812
But it didn't close forever.
It's open right now.

11:28.979 --> 11:33.233
Ah, yes, sometimes when grownups say
"forever," they mean "a very long time. "

11:33.901 --> 11:37.112
Such as, "I feel like I've eaten
nothing but cabbage soup forever. "

11:37.446 --> 11:40.949
- Now, Pops.
- The factory did close, Charlie.

11:41.117 --> 11:45.120
And it seemed like it was
going to be closed forever.

11:45.287 --> 11:49.958
Then one day we saw smoke
rising from the chimneys.

11:50.126 --> 11:54.003
- The factory was back in business.
- Did you get your job back?

11:54.839 --> 11:56.297
No.

11:56.465 --> 11:58.299
No one did.

12:01.762 --> 12:03.596
But there must be
people working there.

12:03.931 --> 12:07.308
Think about it, Charlie.
Have you ever seen a single person...

12:07.476 --> 12:10.145
...going into that factory
or coming out of it?

12:11.605 --> 12:14.524
No. The gates are always closed.

12:14.692 --> 12:16.359
Exactly.

12:16.944 --> 12:19.028
But then, who's running the machines?

12:19.196 --> 12:22.157
- Nobody knows, Charlie.
- It certainly is a mystery.

12:22.867 --> 12:24.659
Hasn't someone asked Mr. Wonka?

12:25.703 --> 12:29.372
Nobody sees him anymore.
He never comes out.

12:30.166 --> 12:34.461
The only thing that comes
out of that place is the candy...

12:34.628 --> 12:37.172
...already packed and addressed.

12:37.798 --> 12:42.761
I'd give anything in the world
just to go in one more time...

12:42.928 --> 12:47.015
...and see what's become
of that amazing factory.

12:48.017 --> 12:51.561
Well, you won't, because you can't.
No one can.

12:52.021 --> 12:55.690
It's a mystery,
and it will always be a mystery.

12:56.150 --> 13:00.653
That little factory of yours, Charlie, is as
close as any of us is ever going to get.

13:02.364 --> 13:06.034
Come on, Charlie. I think it's time
we let your grandparents get some sleep.

13:08.496 --> 13:11.289
- Good night, Grandpa George.
- Night, Charlie.

13:11.457 --> 13:13.541
- Night-night.
Chair.

13:13.709 --> 13:15.585
Thank you, dear.

13:17.213 --> 13:19.005
Night, Grandpa Joe.

13:20.883 --> 13:22.717
Good night, Grandma Georgina.

13:22.885 --> 13:26.054
Nothing's impossible, Charlie.

13:43.113 --> 13:45.532
- Good night.
Night, Charlie.

13:45.699 --> 13:47.283
Sleep well.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.963
Indeed, that very night...

14:00.130 --> 14:03.591
...the impossible
had already been set in motion.

15:04.153 --> 15:06.279
Dear people of the world...

15:06.655 --> 15:08.197
...I, Willy Wonka...

15:08.574 --> 15:12.994
...have decided to allow five children
to visit my factory this year.

15:13.162 --> 15:16.831
In addition, one of these children
shall receive a special prize...

15:16.999 --> 15:20.585
...beyond anything
you could ever imagine.

15:21.128 --> 15:23.004
Five golden tickets have been hidden...

15:23.172 --> 15:26.507
...underneath the ordinary wrapping
paper of five ordinary Wonka bars.

15:26.884 --> 15:28.885
The bars may be anywhere...

15:29.053 --> 15:34.807
...in any shop, in any street, in any
town, in any country in the world.

16:09.218 --> 16:12.762
Wouldn't it be something, Charlie,
to open a bar of candy...

16:12.930 --> 16:15.348
...and find a golden ticket inside?

16:15.683 --> 16:20.228
I know, but I only get one bar a year,
for my birthday.

16:20.396 --> 16:22.063
Well, it's your birthday next week.

16:22.648 --> 16:25.692
You have as much chance
as anybody does.

16:25.859 --> 16:28.903
Balderdash. The kids who are
going to find the golden tickets...

16:29.071 --> 16:31.906
...are the ones who can afford
to buy candy bars every day.

16:32.074 --> 16:35.994
Our Charlie gets only one a year.
He doesn't have a chance.

16:36.328 --> 16:38.788
Everyone has a chance, Charlie.

16:39.206 --> 16:42.917
Mark my words,
the kid who finds the first ticket...

16:43.085 --> 16:45.461
...will be fat, fat, fat.

16:46.130 --> 16:47.880
Augustus. This way.

16:52.845 --> 16:54.804
I am eating the Wonka bar...

16:54.972 --> 16:58.266
...and I taste something
that is not chocolate...

16:59.184 --> 17:01.060
...or coconut...

17:01.645 --> 17:03.938
...or walnut or peanut butter...

17:04.440 --> 17:06.357
...or nougat...

17:06.775 --> 17:11.279
...or butter brittle
or caramel or sprinkles.

17:12.698 --> 17:14.490
So I look...

17:15.909 --> 17:17.452
...and I find the golden ticket.

17:17.618 --> 17:19.787
Augustus, how did you celebrate?

17:20.455 --> 17:22.707
I eat more candy.

17:25.961 --> 17:28.796
We knew Augustus would find
the golden ticket.

17:29.465 --> 17:31.716
He eats so many candy bars a day...

17:31.884 --> 17:35.636
...that it was not possible
for him not to find one.

17:35.804 --> 17:38.973
Yes, it is good, Augustus.

17:39.183 --> 17:41.392
- Golden ticket claimed and four more...

17:41.602 --> 17:43.144
Told you it'd be a porker.

17:43.562 --> 17:45.438
What a repulsive boy.

17:45.856 --> 17:47.523
Only four golden tickets left.

17:47.733 --> 17:52.320
Now that they've found one,
things will really get crazy.

17:52.488 --> 17:54.489
- Of every shape, size and hue.

17:58.452 --> 18:01.079
Veruca.
Can you spell that for us, please?

18:01.246 --> 18:04.791
V- E-R-U-C-A. Veruca Salt.

18:06.335 --> 18:10.129
As soon as little Veruca told me she had
to have one of these golden tickets...

18:10.380 --> 18:13.382
...I started buying all the Wonka bars
I could lay my hands on.

18:14.009 --> 18:16.385
Thousands of them.
Hundreds of thousands.

18:17.179 --> 18:20.973
I'm in the nut business, you see.
So I say to my workers:

18:21.558 --> 18:24.519
Morning, ladies. From now on,
you can stop shelling peanuts...

18:24.686 --> 18:27.939
...and start shelling the wrappers
off these chocolate bars instead.

18:42.454 --> 18:44.372
Three days went by,
and we had no luck.

18:44.540 --> 18:48.084
Oh, it was terrible. My Veruca
got more and more upset each day.

18:48.252 --> 18:49.710
Where's my golden ticket?

18:49.878 --> 18:52.213
I want my golden ticket.

18:53.632 --> 18:57.385
Well, gentlemen, I just hated to see
my little girl feeling unhappy like that.

18:57.761 --> 19:01.097
I vowed I would keep searching
until I could give her what she wanted.

19:02.558 --> 19:05.893
And finally, I found her a ticket.

19:32.421 --> 19:35.715
Daddy, I want another pony.

19:37.634 --> 19:39.635
She's even worse than the fat boy.

19:40.179 --> 19:43.764
I don't think that was really fair.
She didn't find the ticket herself.

19:44.099 --> 19:48.394
Don't worry about it, Charlie.
That man spoils his daughter.

19:48.812 --> 19:52.481
And no good ever comes
from spoiling a child like that.

19:57.905 --> 20:01.199
Charlie, Mum and I thought...

20:01.366 --> 20:04.243
...maybe you wanna open
your birthday present tonight.

20:10.751 --> 20:12.126
Here you are.

20:24.556 --> 20:26.140
Maybe I should wait till morning.

20:26.391 --> 20:28.142
- Like hell.
- Pop.

20:28.644 --> 20:34.148
All together, we're 381 years old.
We don't wait.

20:42.157 --> 20:44.867
Now, Charlie,
you mustn't feel too disappointed...

20:45.035 --> 20:46.994
...you know, if you don't get the...

20:47.162 --> 20:49.330
Whatever happens,
you'll still have the candy.

21:18.860 --> 21:20.528
Ah, well.

21:20.988 --> 21:22.697
That's that.

21:24.491 --> 21:27.201
- We'll share it.
- Oh, no, Charlie.

21:27.369 --> 21:28.995
Not your birthday present.

21:29.871 --> 21:33.207
It's my candy bar,
and I'll do what I want with it.

21:39.881 --> 21:41.382
Thank you, darling.

21:42.342 --> 21:43.926
Thank you, Charlie.

21:48.390 --> 21:49.724
Bless you.

22:15.709 --> 22:17.835
All right, let's see who found it.

22:22.424 --> 22:25.760
"The third ticket was found
by Miss Violet Beauregarde. "

22:25.927 --> 22:27.803
Hah! Hah! Hyah!

22:44.154 --> 22:50.076
These are just some of the 263
trophies and medals my Violet has won.

22:50.243 --> 22:53.662
I'm a gum chewer mostly, but when
I heard about these ticket things...

22:53.830 --> 22:56.040
...I laid off the gum,
switched to candy bars.

22:56.375 --> 22:59.418
She's just a driven young woman.
I don't know where she gets it.

23:02.005 --> 23:04.131
I'm the Junior World Champion
Gum Chewer.

23:04.299 --> 23:06.300
This piece of gum
I'm chewing right now...

23:06.468 --> 23:10.388
...I've been working on for
three months solid. That's a record.

23:10.555 --> 23:14.975
Of course, I did have my share
of trophies, mostly baton.

23:15.394 --> 23:19.605
So it says that one kid's gonna get
this special prize, better than all the rest.

23:20.148 --> 23:23.984
I don't care who those other four are.
That kid, it's gonna be me.

23:24.319 --> 23:25.611
Tell them why, Violet.

23:26.029 --> 23:27.363
Because I'm a winner.

23:27.906 --> 23:29.657
What a beastly girl.

23:29.825 --> 23:31.951
Despicable.

23:32.119 --> 23:34.328
You don't know
what we're talking about.

23:36.248 --> 23:37.998
Dragonflies?

23:38.166 --> 23:39.834
But wait, this is just in.

23:40.001 --> 23:45.506
The fourth golden ticket has been found
by a boy called Mike Teavee.

23:57.477 --> 24:00.271
All you had to do was track
the manufacturing dates...

24:00.439 --> 24:03.858
...offset by weather
and the derivative of the Nikkei Index.

24:04.317 --> 24:06.152
A retard could figure it out.

24:07.362 --> 24:10.030
Most of the time
I don't know what he's talking about.

24:10.198 --> 24:13.117
You know, kids these days,
what with all the technology...

24:13.285 --> 24:15.536
Die! Die! Die!

24:17.330 --> 24:19.540
Doesn't seem like
they stay kids very long.

24:24.629 --> 24:27.047
In the end,
I only had to buy one candy bar.

24:27.424 --> 24:30.217
- And how did it taste?
- I don't know.

24:30.385 --> 24:31.760
I hate chocolate.

24:31.928 --> 24:35.890
It's a good thing you're going to a
chocolate factory, you ungrateful little...

24:46.234 --> 24:49.612
That question is,
who will be the winner of the last gold...?

24:56.119 --> 24:57.745
- Dad?
- Yes, Charlie?

24:58.163 --> 24:59.997
Why aren't you at work?

25:01.166 --> 25:05.044
Oh, well, the toothpaste factory
thought they'd give me a bit of time off.

25:05.754 --> 25:07.087
Like summer vacation?

25:07.797 --> 25:10.132
Sure. Something like that.

25:13.553 --> 25:17.473
In fact, it wasn't like a vacation at all.

25:18.517 --> 25:22.770
The upswing in candy sales
had led to a rise in cavities...

25:22.938 --> 25:25.981
...which led to a rise
in toothpaste sales.

25:30.654 --> 25:34.448
With the extra money,
the factory had decided to modernize...

25:35.033 --> 25:38.577
...eliminating Mr. Bucket's job.

25:43.833 --> 25:46.460
We were barely making
ends meet as it was.

25:46.628 --> 25:48.671
You'll find another job.

25:48.838 --> 25:53.008
Until then, I'll just... Well, I'll just
thin down the soup a little more.

25:54.469 --> 25:58.472
Don't worry, Mr. Bucket,
our luck will change.

25:58.807 --> 26:00.432
I know it.

26:04.145 --> 26:05.646
Charlie.

26:21.997 --> 26:24.164
My secret hoard.

26:27.168 --> 26:31.005
You and I are going to have
one more fling...

26:31.172 --> 26:33.465
...at finding that last ticket.

26:34.259 --> 26:36.468
You sure you want to spend
your money on that?

26:36.636 --> 26:39.346
Of course I'm sure. Here.

26:40.849 --> 26:43.100
Run down to the nearest store...

26:43.268 --> 26:47.104
...and buy the first
Wonka candy bar you see.

26:47.272 --> 26:50.816
Bring it straight back,
and we'll open it together.

26:59.200 --> 27:01.910
Such a good boy, really.

27:03.163 --> 27:04.371
Such a good...

27:06.916 --> 27:08.375
Grandpa?

27:09.419 --> 27:11.879
- You fell asleep.
- Have you got it?

27:17.385 --> 27:19.386
Which end should we open first?

27:19.763 --> 27:22.222
Just do it quick, like a Band-Aid.

27:52.462 --> 27:55.589
Did you see that some kid in Russia
found the last golden ticket?

27:55.757 --> 27:57.841
Yes, it was in the paper this morning.

27:58.009 --> 28:01.512
Good boy. Come on, George.
Good boy.

28:53.898 --> 28:56.650
One Wonka Whipple-Scrumptious
Fudgemallow Delight, please.

28:56.818 --> 28:59.319
Okay. Here you go.

29:04.993 --> 29:06.702
The nerve of some people.

29:07.328 --> 29:10.622
I know. Forging a ticket. Come on.

29:23.386 --> 29:25.637
It's a golden ticket.

29:27.390 --> 29:30.976
You found Wonka's last golden ticket.

29:31.561 --> 29:33.645
In my shop too!

29:34.189 --> 29:38.192
Listen. I'll buy it from you.
I'll give you $50 and a new bicycle.

29:38.359 --> 29:41.487
Are you crazy?
I'd give him $500 for that ticket.

29:41.654 --> 29:44.198
You wanna sell me your ticket
for $500, young man?

29:44.365 --> 29:46.658
That's enough of that.
Leave the kid alone.

29:47.285 --> 29:52.372
Listen. Don't let anyone have it.
Take it straight home, you understand?

29:53.875 --> 29:55.209
Thank you.

30:02.509 --> 30:04.676
Mom! Dad!

30:05.553 --> 30:07.721
I found it!

30:07.889 --> 30:10.390
The last golden ticket! It's mine!

30:24.405 --> 30:25.906
Yippee!

30:32.872 --> 30:34.081
Here.

30:34.916 --> 30:38.043
Read it aloud.
Let's hear exactly what it says.

30:39.045 --> 30:44.007
"Greetings to you, the lucky finder of
this golden ticket, from Mr. Willy Wonka.

30:44.509 --> 30:48.637
I shake you warmly by the hand.
For now, I invite you to my factory...

30:48.805 --> 30:52.015
...and be my guest
for one whole day. "

30:52.183 --> 30:55.435
"I, Willy Wonka, will conduct you
around the factory myself...

30:55.603 --> 30:57.604
...showing you everything
there is to see. "

30:57.814 --> 30:59.773
"Afterwards,
when it is time to leave...

30:59.941 --> 31:03.318
...you will be escorted home
by a procession of large trucks...

31:03.486 --> 31:06.780
...each one filled with all the chocolate
you could ever eat. "

31:06.948 --> 31:11.660
"And remember, one of you lucky
five children will receive an extra prize...

31:11.828 --> 31:14.037
...beyond your wildest imagination.

31:14.205 --> 31:16.582
Now, here are your instructions. "

31:16.749 --> 31:20.669
"On the 1 st of February, you must come
to the factory gates at 10 a. m. Sharp.

31:20.837 --> 31:24.214
You're allowed to bring one member
of your family to look after you.

31:24.382 --> 31:26.425
Until then, Willy Wonka. "

31:27.302 --> 31:28.635
The 1 st of February.

31:29.721 --> 31:32.598
- But that's tomorrow.
- Then there's not a moment to lose.

31:32.765 --> 31:34.933
Wash your face, comb your hair,
scrub your hands...

31:35.101 --> 31:36.602
...brush your teeth, blow your nose.

31:36.769 --> 31:38.061
And get that mud off your pants.

31:38.271 --> 31:40.272
We must all try and keep very calm.

31:40.815 --> 31:45.152
First thing that we have to decide is this:
Who is going with Charlie to the factory?

31:45.445 --> 31:48.572
I will. I'll take him. You leave it to me.

31:48.948 --> 31:51.450
How about you, dear?
Don't you think you ought to go?

31:51.826 --> 31:56.163
Well, Grandpa Joe seems to know
more about it than we do, and...

31:57.123 --> 31:59.166
Provided, of course,
he feels well enough.

31:59.375 --> 32:01.919
Yippee!

32:02.587 --> 32:05.172
No. We're not going.

32:08.509 --> 32:11.762
A woman offered me $500
for the ticket.

32:11.930 --> 32:14.014
I bet someone else would pay more.

32:14.182 --> 32:16.558
We need the money more
than we need the chocolate.

32:26.653 --> 32:29.029
Young man, come here.

32:32.867 --> 32:35.535
There's plenty of money out there.

32:35.703 --> 32:37.829
They print more every day.

32:38.790 --> 32:40.707
But this ticket...

32:40.875 --> 32:44.795
...there's only five of them
in the whole world...

32:44.963 --> 32:47.297
...and that's all
there's ever going to be.

32:48.132 --> 32:53.220
Only a dummy would give this up
for something as common as money.

32:53.763 --> 32:55.973
Are you a dummy?

32:56.891 --> 32:58.225
No, sir.

32:58.893 --> 33:02.854
Then get that mud off your pants.
You've got a factory to go to.

33:46.941 --> 33:49.276
Daddy, I want to go in.

33:49.444 --> 33:50.944
It's 9:59, sweetheart.

33:51.112 --> 33:53.655
Make time go faster.

33:54.032 --> 33:56.033
Do you think Mr. Wonka
will recognize you?

33:56.200 --> 34:00.162
Hard to say. It's been years.

34:07.587 --> 34:09.295
Eyes on the prize, Violet.

34:09.464 --> 34:11.757
Eyes on the prize.

34:29.442 --> 34:32.027
Please enter.

34:43.456 --> 34:46.458
Come forward.

34:50.338 --> 34:53.590
Close the gates.

35:01.808 --> 35:03.850
Dear visitors...

35:04.018 --> 35:09.231
...it is my great pleasure to welcome you
to my humble factory.

35:11.567 --> 35:13.568
And who am I?

35:14.987 --> 35:16.738
Well...

35:20.243 --> 35:22.244
Willy Wonka, Willy Wonka

35:22.411 --> 35:24.371
The amazing chocolatier

35:24.539 --> 35:26.540
Willy Wonka, Willy Wonka

35:26.707 --> 35:28.667
Everybody give a cheer!
Hooray!

35:28.835 --> 35:30.710
He's modest, clever and so smart

35:30.878 --> 35:32.546
He barely can restrain it

35:32.713 --> 35:34.714
With so much generosity

35:34.882 --> 35:36.550
There is no way to contain it!

35:36.717 --> 35:40.095
To contain it
To contain, to contain, to contain!

35:40.555 --> 35:42.097
Hooray!

35:42.682 --> 35:44.599
Willy Wonka, Willy Wonka

35:44.767 --> 35:46.601
He's the one that you're about to meet

35:46.769 --> 35:48.353
Willy Wonka, Willy Wonka

35:48.521 --> 35:50.814
He's the genius who just can't be beat

35:50.982 --> 35:52.732
The magician and the chocolate wiz

35:52.942 --> 35:54.609
The best darn guy who ever lived

35:54.777 --> 36:00.407
Willy Wonka, here he is!

36:18.968 --> 36:21.845
The amazing chocolatier

36:32.106 --> 36:34.065
Wasn't that just magnificent?

36:34.233 --> 36:38.904
I was worried it was getting dodgy
in the middle part, but then that finale...

36:39.071 --> 36:40.947
Wow!

36:43.284 --> 36:45.076
Who are you?

36:45.786 --> 36:48.788
- He's Willy Wonka.
- Really?

36:58.799 --> 37:00.967
"Good morning, starshine.

37:01.135 --> 37:03.303
The Earth says hello. "

37:11.479 --> 37:13.521
"Dear guests, greetings.

37:14.732 --> 37:18.610
Welcome to the factory.
I shake you warmly by the hand.

37:22.198 --> 37:25.075
My name is Willy Wonka. "

37:25.243 --> 37:26.952
Then shouldn't you be up there?

37:27.787 --> 37:31.456
I couldn't very well watch the show
from up there, now, could I, little girl?

37:31.624 --> 37:35.460
Mr. Wonka, I don't know
if you'll remember me...

37:35.628 --> 37:38.505
...but I used to work
here in the factory.

37:39.006 --> 37:42.008
Were you one of those despicable spies
who tried to steal...

37:42.176 --> 37:46.054
...my life's work and sell it to parasitic,
copycat, candy-making cads?

37:46.347 --> 37:47.555
No, sir.

37:48.224 --> 37:49.808
Then wonderful. Welcome back.

37:49.976 --> 37:51.351
Let's get a move on, kids.

37:54.438 --> 37:56.815
Don't you want to know our names?

37:56.983 --> 38:01.695
Can't imagine how it would matter.
Come quickly. Far too much to see.

38:07.368 --> 38:09.202
Just drop your coats anywhere.

38:15.376 --> 38:18.712
- Mr. Wonka? Sure is toasty in here.
- What?

38:19.338 --> 38:24.009
Oh, I have to keep it warm. My workers
are used to an extremely hot climate.

38:24.176 --> 38:26.386
They just can't stand the cold.

38:26.554 --> 38:27.762
Who are the workers?

38:28.347 --> 38:30.181
All in good time. Now...

38:34.979 --> 38:36.563
Mr. Wonka, I'm Violet Beauregarde.

38:37.606 --> 38:39.316
Oh.

38:39.525 --> 38:41.568
- I don't care.
- Well, you should care.

38:41.736 --> 38:44.195
Because I'm gonna win
the special prize at the end.

38:44.363 --> 38:47.282
Well, you do seem confident,
and confidence is key.

38:50.328 --> 38:53.413
I'm Veruca Salt.
It's very nice to meet you, sir.

38:53.914 --> 38:56.249
I always thought a verruca
was a type of wart you got...

38:56.459 --> 38:57.917
...on the bottom of your foot.

39:00.421 --> 39:03.381
I am Augustus Gloop.
I love your chocolate.

39:04.592 --> 39:07.260
I can see that. So do I.

39:07.428 --> 39:10.555
I never expected to have
so much in common.

39:14.602 --> 39:17.395
You. You're Mike Teavee.

39:17.897 --> 39:20.106
You're the little devil
who cracked the system.

39:22.318 --> 39:25.278
And you. Well, you're just lucky
to be here, aren't you?

39:27.406 --> 39:29.949
And the rest of you must be their...

39:37.416 --> 39:39.834
- Parents.
- Yeah.

39:40.002 --> 39:42.003
Moms and dads.

39:43.672 --> 39:45.215
Dad?

39:47.176 --> 39:49.094
Papa?

39:55.559 --> 39:58.269
Okay, then. Let's move along.

40:06.946 --> 40:10.990
Is it just me or does Wonka seem
a few quarters short of a buck?

40:11.158 --> 40:13.326
I'm sorry, I don't speak American.

40:15.037 --> 40:17.205
- Would you like some chocolate?
- Sure.

40:17.373 --> 40:19.499
Then you should've brought some.

40:23.170 --> 40:25.547
- Let's be friends.
- Best friends.

40:37.935 --> 40:39.686
An important room, this.

40:39.854 --> 40:43.690
- After all, it is a chocolate factory.
- Then why is the door so small?

40:44.400 --> 40:46.985
That's to keep all the great big
chocolatey flavor inside.

41:09.842 --> 41:13.052
Now, do be careful, my dear children.

41:13.220 --> 41:15.013
Don't lose your heads.

41:15.181 --> 41:17.056
Don't get overexcited.

41:18.017 --> 41:21.102
Just keep very calm.

41:36.869 --> 41:38.077
It's beautiful.

41:39.079 --> 41:40.788
What?

41:41.207 --> 41:43.249
Oh, yeah, it's very beautiful.

41:53.093 --> 41:55.428
Every drop of the river...

41:55.596 --> 41:59.098
...is hot, melted chocolate
of the finest quality.

42:04.271 --> 42:06.564
The waterfall is most important.

42:06.732 --> 42:08.441
Mixes the chocolate.

42:08.609 --> 42:11.611
Churns it up. Makes it light and frothy.

42:12.196 --> 42:13.446
By the way...

42:13.614 --> 42:19.369
...no other factory in the world mixes its
chocolate by waterfall, my dear children.

42:19.537 --> 42:21.412
And you can take that to the bank.

42:31.799 --> 42:33.383
People.

42:35.553 --> 42:37.470
Those pipes...

42:37.972 --> 42:42.600
...suck up the chocolate
and carry it away all over the factory.

42:43.310 --> 42:45.979
Thousands of gallons an hour. Yeah.

42:47.398 --> 42:50.316
And do you like my meadow?
Try some of my grass.

42:50.484 --> 42:55.029
Please have a blade. Please do. It's
so delectable and so darn good-looking.

42:55.698 --> 42:57.156
You can eat the grass?

42:57.324 --> 42:59.409
Of course you can.

42:59.577 --> 43:01.828
Everything in this room is eatable.

43:01.996 --> 43:03.329
Even I'm eatable.

43:03.497 --> 43:06.332
But that is called cannibalism,
my dear children...

43:06.500 --> 43:09.335
...and is, in fact, frowned upon
in most societies.

43:09.587 --> 43:10.837
Yeah.

43:11.839 --> 43:13.423
Enjoy.

43:14.091 --> 43:16.342
Go on. Scoot, scoot.

43:37.615 --> 43:39.073
Son.

43:40.492 --> 43:41.701
Please.

43:42.828 --> 43:45.538
Dad, he said, "Enjoy. "

43:59.428 --> 44:02.430
Why hold on to it?
Why not start a new piece?

44:03.223 --> 44:07.727
Because then I wouldn't be a champion.
I'd be a loser, like you.

44:36.715 --> 44:38.383
Daddy, look over there.

44:40.052 --> 44:41.761
What is it?

44:41.929 --> 44:43.471
It's a little person.

44:43.639 --> 44:46.099
Over there, by the waterfall.

44:48.268 --> 44:50.937
- There's two of them.
- There's more than two.

44:57.277 --> 44:59.904
- Where do they come from?
- Who are they?

45:01.657 --> 45:03.449
Are they real people?

45:03.617 --> 45:06.119
Of course they're real people.
They're Oompa-Loompas.

45:09.832 --> 45:12.792
- Oompa-Loompas?
- Imported, direct from Loompaland.

45:12.960 --> 45:15.586
- There's no such place.
- What?

45:15.754 --> 45:19.257
Mr. Wonka, I teach high-school
geography, and I'm here to tell you...

45:19.425 --> 45:24.595
Well, then you'll know all about it,
and, oh, what a terrible country it is.

45:35.607 --> 45:37.942
The whole place is nothing
but thick jungles...

45:38.110 --> 45:41.696
...infested by the most dangerous beasts
in the entire world.

45:42.531 --> 45:46.993
Hornswogglers and snozzwangers and
those terrible, wicked whangdoodles.

46:08.140 --> 46:12.059
I went to Loompaland looking for
exotic new flavors for candy.

46:16.148 --> 46:17.440
Instead...

46:17.608 --> 46:19.650
...I found the Oompa-Loompas.

46:27.785 --> 46:32.747
They lived in tree houses to escape from
the fierce creatures who lived below.

46:36.293 --> 46:40.546
The Oompa-Loompas ate nothing but
green caterpillars, which tasted revolting.

46:41.882 --> 46:43.716
The Oompa-Loompas looked for things...

46:43.884 --> 46:46.844
...to mash up with the caterpillars
to make them taste better:

46:47.095 --> 46:50.515
Red beetles,
the bark of the bong-bong tree.

46:50.682 --> 46:51.933
All of them beastly...

46:52.476 --> 46:55.102
...but not quite so beastly
as the caterpillars.

47:01.860 --> 47:03.653
Mmm.

47:27.386 --> 47:31.472
But the food they longed for the most
was the cocoa bean.

47:35.310 --> 47:39.021
An Oompa-Loompa was lucky if he found
three or four cocoa beans a year.

47:39.189 --> 47:41.607
But, oh, how they craved them.

47:42.818 --> 47:45.945
All they'd ever think about
was cocoa beans.

47:51.326 --> 47:55.621
The cocoa bean is the thing from which
chocolate is made, so I told the chief:

48:16.310 --> 48:18.978
They are such wonderful workers.

48:19.146 --> 48:22.106
I feel I must warn you, though,
they are rather mischievous.

48:22.274 --> 48:24.066
Always making jokes.

48:24.693 --> 48:27.987
Augustus, my child,
that is not a good thing you do!

48:30.490 --> 48:31.991
Hey, little boy.

48:32.159 --> 48:35.202
My chocolate must be untouched
by human hands.

48:36.163 --> 48:37.455
Ah!

48:42.169 --> 48:43.669
He'll drown.

48:45.088 --> 48:46.631
He can't swim.

48:46.798 --> 48:48.341
Save him!

48:49.551 --> 48:52.345
Augustus! No!

48:58.685 --> 49:00.728
Augustus!

49:09.738 --> 49:12.698
Augustus, watch out!

49:12.908 --> 49:16.702
Ah!

49:29.216 --> 49:30.800
There he goes.

49:31.218 --> 49:34.053
- Ah!
- Call the fire brigade!

49:34.221 --> 49:36.514
It's a wonder how
that pipe is big enough.

49:37.391 --> 49:39.558
It isn't big enough.
He's slowing down.

49:39.726 --> 49:41.018
He's gonna stick.

49:42.604 --> 49:43.896
I think he has.

49:47.442 --> 49:48.943
He's blocked the whole pipe.

49:51.989 --> 49:53.948
Look. The Oompa-Loompas.

49:57.953 --> 49:59.412
Back off, you little freaks!

50:02.332 --> 50:03.916
What are they doing?

50:06.294 --> 50:10.172
They're going to treat us to a little song.
It is quite a special occasion.

50:10.340 --> 50:12.675
They haven't had a fresh audience
in many a moon.

50:32.612 --> 50:35.114
Augustus Gloop, Augustus Gloop

50:35.699 --> 50:38.034
The great big, greedy nincompoop

50:38.201 --> 50:43.080
Augustus Gloop, so big and vile
So greedy, foul and infantile

50:43.248 --> 50:45.583
"Come on!" we cried
"The time is ripe

50:45.751 --> 50:48.294
To send him shooting up the pipe!"

50:48.462 --> 50:50.755
But don't, dear children, be alarmed

50:51.048 --> 50:53.549
Augustus Gloop will not be harmed

50:53.717 --> 50:55.968
Augustus Gloop will not be harmed

51:27.459 --> 51:29.460
Although, of course, we must admit

51:29.669 --> 51:31.837
He will be altered quite a bit

51:32.464 --> 51:34.965
Slowly, wheels go round and round

51:35.175 --> 51:37.176
And cogs begin to grind and pound

51:37.344 --> 51:39.970
We'll boil him for a minute more

51:40.138 --> 51:42.348
Until we're absolutely sure

51:42.516 --> 51:45.184
Then out he comes, by God, by grace

51:45.352 --> 51:50.356
A miracle has taken place

51:50.524 --> 51:53.234
This greedy brute, this louse's ear

51:55.695 --> 51:57.863
Is loved by people everywhere

51:58.031 --> 52:00.866
For who could hate or bear a grudge

52:01.034 --> 52:07.081
Against a luscious bit of fudge?

52:14.965 --> 52:16.882
Ah!

52:33.233 --> 52:35.192
Bravo! Well done!

52:35.402 --> 52:37.570
Aren't they delightful?
Aren't they charming?

52:37.737 --> 52:42.241
- I say, that all seemed rather rehearsed.
- Like they knew it was gonna happen.

52:42.951 --> 52:44.702
Oh, poppycock.

52:47.914 --> 52:50.541
Where is my son?
Where does that pipe go to?

52:52.210 --> 52:54.503
That pipe, it just so happens to lead...

52:54.671 --> 52:57.006
...directly to the room
where I make delicious...

52:57.174 --> 52:59.592
...strawberry-flavored,
chocolate-coated fudge.

52:59.759 --> 53:03.304
He will be made into strawberry-flavored,
chocolate-coated fudge.

53:03.471 --> 53:07.016
They'll be selling him by the pound
all over the world?

53:07.184 --> 53:10.060
No. I wouldn't allow it.
The taste would be terrible.

53:10.645 --> 53:14.398
Can you imagine Augustus-flavored,
chocolate-coated Gloop? Ew.

53:14.566 --> 53:15.941
No one would buy it.

53:24.743 --> 53:28.037
I want you to take Mrs. Gloop
up to the Fudge Room, okay?

53:28.205 --> 53:29.705
Help her find her son.

53:29.873 --> 53:35.461
Take a long stick and start poking around
in the big chocolate-mixing barrel, okay?

53:52.229 --> 53:53.812
- Mr. Wonka?
- Huh?

53:54.147 --> 53:57.691
Why would Augustus' name already
be in the Oompa-Loompa song, unless...?

53:57.859 --> 54:01.487
Improvisation is a parlor trick.
Anyone can do it.

54:02.072 --> 54:03.781
You, little girl. Say something.

54:03.990 --> 54:05.991
- Anything.
- Chewing gum.

54:07.035 --> 54:09.203
Chewing gum is really gross
Chewing gum, I hate the most

54:09.371 --> 54:11.413
See? Exactly the same.

54:11.581 --> 54:12.998
No, it isn't.

54:13.583 --> 54:15.668
Uh, you really shouldn't mumble.

54:15.835 --> 54:18.128
Because I can't understand
a word you're saying.

54:20.340 --> 54:23.133
Now, on with the tour.

54:25.887 --> 54:29.807
- Are the Oompa-Loompas really joking?
- Of course they're joking.

54:30.016 --> 54:32.518
That boy will be fine.

55:21.443 --> 55:22.693
What's so funny?

55:23.445 --> 55:26.196
I think it's from all those
doggone cocoa beans.

55:26.364 --> 55:30.242
Hey, by the way, did you guys know
that chocolate contains a property...

55:30.410 --> 55:35.205
...that triggers the release of endorphins?
Gives one the feeling of being in love.

55:35.582 --> 55:37.082
You don't say.

55:39.961 --> 55:41.879
All aboard.

55:52.390 --> 55:53.599
Onward!

56:17.624 --> 56:19.124
Here.

56:19.292 --> 56:23.837
Try some of this. It'll do you good.
You look starved to death.

56:25.340 --> 56:29.760
- It's great.
- That's because it's mixed by waterfall.

56:29.928 --> 56:31.470
The waterfall is most important.

56:31.638 --> 56:35.891
Mixes the chocolate, churns it up,
makes it light and frothy.

56:36.476 --> 56:40.562
- No other factory in the world...
- You already said that.

56:46.152 --> 56:49.780
- You're all quite short, aren't you?
- Well, yeah. We're children.

56:49.948 --> 56:52.574
Well, that's no excuse.
I was never as short as you.

56:52.742 --> 56:56.036
- You were once.
- Was not. Know why?

56:56.204 --> 56:59.915
Because I distinctly remember
putting a hat on top of my head.

57:00.083 --> 57:03.710
Look at your short, little arms.
You could never reach.

57:06.381 --> 57:08.715
Do you even remember
what it was like being a kid?

57:08.883 --> 57:10.968
Oh, boy, do I.

57:14.556 --> 57:15.806
Do I?

57:15.974 --> 57:17.391
In fact, Willy Wonka...

57:17.559 --> 57:20.894
...hadn't thought about his childhood
for years.

57:21.062 --> 57:23.480
Trick or treat!

57:23.815 --> 57:25.399
Trick or treat!

57:33.491 --> 57:35.033
Trick or treat!

57:37.120 --> 57:38.537
Who do we have here?

57:38.705 --> 57:42.416
Ruthie, Veronica, Terrance.

57:42.584 --> 57:44.126
And who's that under the sheet?

57:46.337 --> 57:49.381
Little Willy Wonka.

57:52.218 --> 57:56.680
Willy Wonka was the son
of the city's most famous dentist...

57:56.848 --> 57:58.807
...Wilbur Wonka.

58:05.732 --> 58:07.357
Now...

58:07.525 --> 58:10.360
...let's see what the damage is
this year, shall we?

58:24.501 --> 58:26.335
Caramels.

58:26.878 --> 58:30.172
They'd get stuck in your braces,
wouldn't they?

58:34.594 --> 58:36.970
Lollipops.

58:37.138 --> 58:40.891
Ought to be called
"cavities on a stick. "

58:41.768 --> 58:43.519
Then we have all this...

58:43.686 --> 58:45.062
All this...

58:45.522 --> 58:47.064
...chocolate.

58:49.067 --> 58:53.070
You know, just last week, I was reading
in a very important medical journal...

58:53.279 --> 58:57.908
...that some children
are allergic to chocolate.

58:58.076 --> 59:00.786
Makes their noses itch.

59:01.162 --> 59:03.413
Maybe I'm not allergic.

59:03.581 --> 59:05.916
- I could try a piece.
- Really?

59:07.168 --> 59:09.211
But why take a chance?

59:24.727 --> 59:27.563
Mr. Wonka? Mr. Wonka?

59:27.730 --> 59:30.065
- We're headed for a tunnel.
- Oh, yeah.

59:30.441 --> 59:31.650
Full speed ahead.

59:38.449 --> 59:41.326
- How can they see where they're going?
- They can't.

59:41.828 --> 59:43.829
There's no knowing
where they're going.

59:44.205 --> 59:45.455
Switch on the lights!

01:00:13.067 --> 01:00:14.610
People, keep an eye out.

01:00:14.777 --> 01:00:16.903
We're passing some
very important rooms here.

01:00:22.493 --> 01:00:24.036
What do you use hair cream for?

01:00:25.204 --> 01:00:26.872
To lock in moisture.

01:00:34.047 --> 01:00:36.548
- Whipped cream.
- Precisely.

01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:38.467
That doesn't make sense.

01:00:39.636 --> 01:00:41.345
For your information, little girl...

01:00:41.512 --> 01:00:45.349
...whipped cream isn't whipped cream at
all unless it's been whipped with whips.

01:00:45.516 --> 01:00:47.643
Everybody knows that.

01:01:37.235 --> 01:01:40.195
Stop the boat.
I wanna show you guys something.

01:02:00.967 --> 01:02:04.219
Now, this is the most important room
in the entire factory.

01:02:04.679 --> 01:02:08.849
Now, everyone, enjoy yourselves,
but just don't touch anything.

01:02:09.016 --> 01:02:10.267
Okay? Go on.

01:02:10.476 --> 01:02:11.768
Go on, scoot.

01:02:23.281 --> 01:02:25.115
Hey, Mr. Wonka, what's this?

01:02:26.117 --> 01:02:29.286
Oh. Let me show you.

01:02:31.122 --> 01:02:32.372
Thank you.

01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:34.708
These are Everlasting Gobstoppers.

01:02:34.876 --> 01:02:37.586
They're for children who are given
very little allowance.

01:02:37.754 --> 01:02:41.173
You can suck on it all year,
and it'll never get any smaller.

01:02:41.507 --> 01:02:43.800
- Isn't that neat?
- It's like gum.

01:02:44.385 --> 01:02:46.887
No. Gum is for chewing.

01:02:47.054 --> 01:02:49.347
If you tried chewing
one of these Gobstoppers...

01:02:49.515 --> 01:02:51.558
...you'd break all your little teeth off.

01:02:51.726 --> 01:02:54.060
But they sure do taste terrific.

01:03:01.277 --> 01:03:03.737
And this is Hair Toffee.

01:03:03.905 --> 01:03:06.239
You suck down one of
these little boogers...

01:03:06.407 --> 01:03:08.325
...and in exactly half an hour...

01:03:08.534 --> 01:03:12.245
...a brand-new crop of hair will grow out
over the top of your little noggin.

01:03:12.413 --> 01:03:14.623
And a mustache. And a beard.

01:03:14.791 --> 01:03:17.334
- Who wants a beard?
- Well...

01:03:17.543 --> 01:03:20.670
...beatniks, for one.
Folk singers and motorbike riders.

01:03:20.838 --> 01:03:24.966
You know, all those hip, jazzy,
super-cool, neat, keen and groovy cats.

01:03:25.134 --> 01:03:27.636
It's in the fridge, daddy-o.
Are you hep to the jive?

01:03:27.804 --> 01:03:29.888
Can you dig what I'm laying down?
I knew you could.

01:03:30.056 --> 01:03:32.682
Slide me some skin, soul brother.

01:03:35.895 --> 01:03:37.896
Unfortunately,
the mixture isn't right yet.

01:03:38.064 --> 01:03:41.358
Because an Oompa-Loompa
tried some yesterday, and, well, he...

01:03:46.197 --> 01:03:47.364
How are you today?

01:03:49.158 --> 01:03:50.575
You look great.

01:03:59.252 --> 01:04:00.710
Watch this.

01:04:29.198 --> 01:04:30.448
You mean that's it?

01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:32.868
Do you even know what "it" is?

01:04:33.244 --> 01:04:35.245
- It's gum.
- Yeah.

01:04:35.413 --> 01:04:39.416
It's a stick of the most amazing and
sensational gum in the whole universe.

01:04:39.625 --> 01:04:41.751
Know why? Know why?

01:04:41.919 --> 01:04:45.171
Because this gum is a full
three-course dinner all by itself.

01:04:48.467 --> 01:04:49.926
Why would anyone want that?

01:04:57.310 --> 01:04:59.811
"It will be the end of all kitchens
and all cooking.

01:04:59.979 --> 01:05:03.690
Just a little strip of Wonka's magic
chewing gum and that is all you will...

01:05:03.858 --> 01:05:05.984
...ever need at breakfast,
lunch and dinner.

01:05:06.152 --> 01:05:10.572
This piece of gum happens to be tomato
soup, roast beef and blueberry pie. "

01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:12.657
It sounds great.

01:05:13.159 --> 01:05:16.286
- It sounds weird.
- It sounds like my kind of gum.

01:05:19.165 --> 01:05:22.083
I'd rather you didn't.
There are still some things that are...

01:05:22.251 --> 01:05:25.670
I'm the world-record holder in
chewing gum. I'm not afraid of anything.

01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:34.346
- How is it, honey?
- It's amazing!

01:05:34.513 --> 01:05:37.140
Tomato soup.
I can feel it running down my throat.

01:05:37.308 --> 01:05:38.767
Yeah. Spit it out.

01:05:38.935 --> 01:05:41.478
- Young lady, I think you'd better...
- It's changing.

01:05:42.229 --> 01:05:44.481
Roast beef, with baked potato.

01:05:44.815 --> 01:05:47.484
- Crispy skin and butter.
- Keep chewing.

01:05:47.693 --> 01:05:50.987
My little girl's gonna be the first person
to have a chewing-gum meal.

01:05:51.197 --> 01:05:53.615
Yeah. I'm just a little concerned
about the...

01:05:53.783 --> 01:05:55.450
Blueberry pie and ice cream!

01:05:56.035 --> 01:05:58.536
- That part.
- What's happening to her nose?

01:06:04.210 --> 01:06:05.502
It's turning blue.

01:06:08.381 --> 01:06:10.131
Your whole nose has gone purple.

01:06:10.716 --> 01:06:12.717
What do you mean?

01:06:13.344 --> 01:06:16.054
Violet, you're turning violet.

01:06:17.098 --> 01:06:20.684
- What's happening?
- I told you I hadn't quite got it right.

01:06:20.851 --> 01:06:23.895
Because it goes a little funny
when it gets to the dessert.

01:06:24.063 --> 01:06:25.772
It's the blueberry pie that does it.

01:06:26.565 --> 01:06:28.733
I'm terribly sorry.

01:06:37.368 --> 01:06:40.745
Mother? What's happening to me?

01:06:53.467 --> 01:06:54.884
She's swelling up.

01:06:59.015 --> 01:07:00.265
Like a blueberry.

01:07:29.003 --> 01:07:33.048
I've tried it on, like, 20 Oompa-Loompas,
and each one ended up as a blueberry.

01:07:33.215 --> 01:07:35.008
It's just weird.

01:07:35.176 --> 01:07:37.177
But I can't have a blueberry
as a daughter.

01:07:37.344 --> 01:07:38.928
How is she supposed to compete?

01:07:39.096 --> 01:07:40.513
You could put her in a county fair.

01:07:54.820 --> 01:07:56.821
Yeah, yeah

01:08:01.452 --> 01:08:02.911
Yeah

01:08:03.079 --> 01:08:05.246
Listen close, and listen hard

01:08:05.414 --> 01:08:07.290
To the tale of Violet Beauregarde

01:08:07.458 --> 01:08:10.001
This gentle girl
She sees no wrong

01:08:10.169 --> 01:08:12.587
In chewing, chewing, chewing, chewing

01:08:12.755 --> 01:08:22.138
Chewing, chewing all day long

01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:24.974
Yeah

01:08:34.234 --> 01:08:36.528
She goes on chewing till, at last

01:08:36.694 --> 01:08:38.822
Her chewing muscles grow so vast

01:08:38.988 --> 01:08:41.323
And from her face
Her giant chin

01:08:41.492 --> 01:08:43.827
Sticks out just like a violin

01:08:43.993 --> 01:08:46.162
Chewing, chewing all day long

01:08:46.372 --> 01:08:51.000
Chewing, chewing all day long

01:08:55.506 --> 01:08:57.841
For years and years she chews away

01:08:58.008 --> 01:09:00.343
Her jaws get stronger every day

01:09:00.511 --> 01:09:02.679
And with one great, tremendous chew

01:09:02.888 --> 01:09:05.055
They bite the poor girl's tongue in two

01:09:05.390 --> 01:09:07.392
And that is why we try so hard

01:09:07.893 --> 01:09:10.145
To save Miss Violet Beauregarde

01:09:10.312 --> 01:09:12.522
Chewing, chewing all day long

01:09:12.689 --> 01:09:14.899
Chewing, chewing all day long

01:09:15.067 --> 01:09:17.359
Chewing, chewing, chewing, chewing

01:09:17.528 --> 01:09:26.202
Chewing, chewing all day long

01:09:26.412 --> 01:09:28.537
Mr. Wonka!

01:09:33.919 --> 01:09:36.379
I want you to roll Miss Beauregarde
into the boat...

01:09:37.089 --> 01:09:40.300
...and take her along to
the Juicing Room at once, okay?

01:09:40.926 --> 01:09:43.428
Juicing Room?
What are they gonna do to her there?

01:09:44.013 --> 01:09:45.721
They're gonna squeeze her.

01:09:45.930 --> 01:09:47.849
Like a little pimple.

01:09:48.725 --> 01:09:51.728
We gotta squeeze all that juice
out of her immediately.

01:09:55.024 --> 01:09:56.566
Mother, help me.

01:09:56.734 --> 01:09:58.443
Please.

01:10:03.532 --> 01:10:05.200
Come on.

01:10:05.701 --> 01:10:06.784
Let's boogie.

01:10:07.453 --> 01:10:10.580
Without the boat, we'll have to move
double-time to keep on schedule.

01:10:10.748 --> 01:10:12.040
There's too much to see.

01:10:12.208 --> 01:10:13.249
- Mr. Wonka?
- Yeah?

01:10:13.542 --> 01:10:15.251
Why did you decide to let people in?

01:10:15.502 --> 01:10:17.462
So they could see the factory,
of course.

01:10:17.671 --> 01:10:20.048
But why now? And why only five?

01:10:20.216 --> 01:10:22.508
What's the special prize,
and who gets it?

01:10:22.676 --> 01:10:24.552
The best kind of prize is a surprise.

01:10:26.138 --> 01:10:28.056
Will Violet always be a blueberry?

01:10:28.224 --> 01:10:30.308
No. Maybe. I don't know.

01:10:30.643 --> 01:10:33.603
That's what you get from chewing gum
all day. It's disgusting.

01:10:33.854 --> 01:10:36.147
If you hate gum so much,
why do you make it?

01:10:36.315 --> 01:10:39.275
Once again, you shouldn't mumble.
It's starting to bum me out.

01:10:39.485 --> 01:10:42.362
Can you remember the first candy
you ever ate?

01:10:45.991 --> 01:10:47.200
No.

01:10:47.368 --> 01:10:49.369
In fact, Willy Wonka did remember...

01:10:49.536 --> 01:10:53.539
...the first candy he ever ate.

01:11:53.559 --> 01:11:56.811
I'm sorry, I was having a flashback.

01:11:57.438 --> 01:11:59.188
I see.

01:11:59.565 --> 01:12:01.482
These flashbacks happen often?

01:12:01.650 --> 01:12:03.609
Increasingly...

01:12:03.902 --> 01:12:05.236
...today.

01:12:12.578 --> 01:12:14.787
Ah, this is a room I know all about.

01:12:14.955 --> 01:12:18.082
For you see, Mr. Wonka,
I, myself, am in the nut business.

01:12:18.250 --> 01:12:21.669
Are you using the Havermax 4000
to do your sorting?

01:12:21.837 --> 01:12:23.463
No.

01:12:23.630 --> 01:12:25.089
You're really weird.

01:12:46.403 --> 01:12:49.113
- Squirrels.
- Yeah. Squirrels.

01:12:49.281 --> 01:12:52.533
These squirrels are specially trained
to get the nuts out of shells.

01:13:08.926 --> 01:13:11.427
Why use squirrels?
Why not use Oompa-Loompas?

01:13:11.637 --> 01:13:16.140
Because only squirrels can get the whole
walnut out almost every single time.

01:13:16.725 --> 01:13:19.936
See how they tap them with their
knuckles to make sure it's not bad?

01:13:20.354 --> 01:13:21.646
Oh, look. Look.

01:13:23.399 --> 01:13:24.982
I think that one's got a bad nut.

01:13:27.361 --> 01:13:29.070
Daddy, I want a squirrel.

01:13:29.238 --> 01:13:31.447
Get me one of those squirrels.
I want one.

01:13:31.907 --> 01:13:34.450
Veruca, dear,
you have many marvelous pets.

01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:38.621
All I've got at home is one pony and
two dogs and four cats and six rabbits...

01:13:38.789 --> 01:13:42.333
...and two parakeets and three canaries
and a green parrot and a turtle...

01:13:42.501 --> 01:13:45.670
...and a silly old hamster.
I want a squirrel!

01:13:46.088 --> 01:13:47.338
All right, pet.

01:13:47.506 --> 01:13:50.216
Daddy will get you a squirrel
as soon as he possibly can.

01:13:50.384 --> 01:13:53.928
But I don't want any old squirrel,
I want a trained squirrel.

01:13:55.264 --> 01:13:56.848
Very well.

01:13:57.182 --> 01:14:00.351
Mr. Wonka, how much do you want
for one of these squirrels?

01:14:00.519 --> 01:14:02.478
Name your price.

01:14:03.355 --> 01:14:05.982
Oh, they're not for sale.
She can't have one.

01:14:10.988 --> 01:14:12.572
Daddy.

01:14:14.241 --> 01:14:15.491
I'm sorry, darling.

01:14:15.951 --> 01:14:18.119
Mr. Wonka's being unreasonable.

01:14:20.747 --> 01:14:24.292
If you won't get me a squirrel,
I'll get one myself.

01:14:33.218 --> 01:14:34.594
Veruca.

01:14:36.221 --> 01:14:37.597
Little girl?

01:14:41.393 --> 01:14:43.227
Veruca, come back here at once.

01:14:45.856 --> 01:14:47.482
Veruca.

01:14:59.369 --> 01:15:00.786
Little girl?

01:15:01.288 --> 01:15:03.039
Don't touch that squirrel's nuts.

01:15:03.248 --> 01:15:05.333
It'll make him crazy.

01:15:21.642 --> 01:15:23.100
I'll have you.

01:15:28.357 --> 01:15:29.774
Veruca.

01:15:36.073 --> 01:15:37.406
Veruca.

01:15:39.618 --> 01:15:41.160
No!

01:15:45.541 --> 01:15:46.916
Veruca!

01:15:49.086 --> 01:15:51.420
Let's find the key.

01:15:52.881 --> 01:15:54.215
Nope. Not that one.

01:15:55.300 --> 01:15:57.552
- Daddy!
- Veruca!

01:15:58.554 --> 01:16:00.805
No. It's not that one.

01:16:12.359 --> 01:16:14.110
There it is.

01:16:14.319 --> 01:16:15.486
There it isn't.

01:16:15.654 --> 01:16:17.405
Daddy, I want them to stop.

01:16:28.125 --> 01:16:29.584
What are they doing?

01:16:29.751 --> 01:16:31.752
They're testing to see
if she's a bad nut.

01:16:33.839 --> 01:16:36.632
Oh, my goodness.
She is a bad nut after all.

01:16:43.849 --> 01:16:45.141
Veruca!

01:16:45.726 --> 01:16:47.101
Daddy!

01:16:47.269 --> 01:16:48.811
Where are they taking her?

01:16:48.979 --> 01:16:51.772
Where all the other bad nuts go.
To the garbage chute.

01:16:53.275 --> 01:16:55.526
- Where does the chute go?
- To the incinerator.

01:16:56.361 --> 01:16:58.696
But don't worry.
We only light it on Tuesdays.

01:16:58.864 --> 01:17:00.489
Today is Tuesday.

01:17:02.659 --> 01:17:05.703
There's always the chance
they decided not to light it today.

01:17:15.547 --> 01:17:17.006
- Ah!
- Ah!

01:17:24.056 --> 01:17:27.016
Now, she may be stuck in the chute
just below the top.

01:17:27.184 --> 01:17:30.811
If that's the case, all you have to do
is just reach in and pull her out.

01:17:31.688 --> 01:17:32.897
Okay?

01:18:10.936 --> 01:18:14.063
Veruca Salt, the little brute

01:18:14.231 --> 01:18:17.358
Has just gone down the garbage chute

01:18:17.526 --> 01:18:21.612
And she will meet, as she descends

01:18:21.780 --> 01:18:31.956
A rather different set of friends

01:18:32.124 --> 01:18:35.251
A fish head, for example, cut

01:18:35.460 --> 01:18:38.504
This morning from a halibut

01:18:38.672 --> 01:18:41.924
An oyster from an oyster stew

01:18:42.092 --> 01:18:45.845
A steak that no one else would chew

01:18:46.012 --> 01:18:49.348
And lots of other things as well

01:18:49.516 --> 01:18:55.646
Each with its rather horrid smell

01:18:55.814 --> 01:18:59.567
Horrid smell

01:18:59.901 --> 01:19:03.112
These are Veruca's newfound friends

01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:06.824
That she will meet as she descends

01:19:06.992 --> 01:19:12.246
These are Veruca's newfound friends

01:19:31.349 --> 01:19:34.894
Who went and spoiled her, who indeed?

01:19:35.061 --> 01:19:38.481
Who pandered to her every need?

01:19:38.648 --> 01:19:41.859
Who turned her into such a brat?

01:19:42.027 --> 01:19:43.819
Who are the culprits?

01:19:44.029 --> 01:19:45.488
Who did that?

01:19:45.655 --> 01:19:48.949
The guilty ones, now this is sad

01:19:49.242 --> 01:19:52.828
Are dear old Mum and loving Dad

01:19:53.747 --> 01:19:54.830
Ah!

01:20:03.381 --> 01:20:05.674
Oh, really? Oh, good.

01:20:05.884 --> 01:20:08.427
I've just been informed
that the incinerator's broken.

01:20:08.595 --> 01:20:12.181
So there should be about three weeks
of rotten garbage to break their fall.

01:20:12.349 --> 01:20:13.849
Well, that's good news.

01:20:14.142 --> 01:20:15.643
Yeah.

01:20:16.144 --> 01:20:18.896
Well, let's keep on trucking.

01:20:21.566 --> 01:20:23.776
I don't know why
I didn't think of this earlier.

01:20:23.944 --> 01:20:27.154
The elevator's by far the most
efficient way to get around the factory.

01:20:27.322 --> 01:20:29.156
There can't be this many floors.

01:20:30.075 --> 01:20:32.159
How do you know, Mr. Smarty-Pants?

01:20:32.327 --> 01:20:35.079
This isn't an ordinary
up-and-down elevator, by the way.

01:20:35.247 --> 01:20:37.748
This elevator can go sideways,
longways, slantways...

01:20:37.916 --> 01:20:39.542
...and any other ways
you can think of.

01:20:39.709 --> 01:20:42.586
You just press any button
and, whoosh, you're off.

01:20:52.764 --> 01:20:54.098
Oh, look. Look.

01:20:55.350 --> 01:20:58.435
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Fudge Mountain.

01:21:21.042 --> 01:21:22.376
Oh.

01:21:27.465 --> 01:21:29.258
I'd rather not talk about this one.

01:21:40.645 --> 01:21:42.771
This is the Puppet Hospital
and Burn Center.

01:21:47.319 --> 01:21:50.154
It's relatively new.

01:21:56.786 --> 01:21:58.287
Ah, the administration offices.

01:22:00.457 --> 01:22:01.874
Hello, Doris.

01:22:37.202 --> 01:22:39.995
Why is everything here
completely pointless?

01:22:40.205 --> 01:22:42.164
Candy doesn't have to have a point.

01:22:42.332 --> 01:22:43.666
That's why it's candy.

01:22:43.833 --> 01:22:45.334
It's stupid.

01:22:45.877 --> 01:22:49.088
Candy is a waste of time.

01:22:49.714 --> 01:22:52.967
No son of mine is going to be
a chocolatier.

01:22:53.510 --> 01:22:55.052
Then I'll run away.

01:22:55.220 --> 01:22:57.346
To Switzerland. Bavaria.

01:22:57.597 --> 01:22:59.515
The candy capitals of the world.

01:23:00.225 --> 01:23:01.558
Go ahead.

01:23:01.726 --> 01:23:03.560
But I won't be here
when you come back.

01:23:32.132 --> 01:23:33.424
Sorry, son.

01:23:33.591 --> 01:23:36.093
We're closing for the night.

01:24:01.536 --> 01:24:03.203
I wanna pick a room.

01:24:06.291 --> 01:24:07.708
Go ahead.

01:24:26.561 --> 01:24:27.853
Here.

01:24:28.313 --> 01:24:31.231
Put these on quick, and don't
take them off whatever you do.

01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:34.818
This light could burn your eyeballs
right out of your skulls.

01:24:35.153 --> 01:24:38.113
And we certainly don't want that,
now, do we?

01:24:40.950 --> 01:24:44.661
This is the testing room for my
very latest and greatest invention:

01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:47.539
Television Chocolate.

01:24:47.707 --> 01:24:48.957
One day it occurred to me:

01:24:49.125 --> 01:24:51.710
"Hey, if television can break up
a photograph...

01:24:51.878 --> 01:24:55.923
...into millions and millions of tiny pieces
and send it whizzing through the air...

01:24:56.091 --> 01:24:58.008
...then reassemble it
on the other end...

01:24:58.176 --> 01:25:00.177
...why can't I do the same
with chocolate?

01:25:00.637 --> 01:25:03.472
Why can't I send a real bar
of chocolate...

01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:06.016
...through the television,
all ready to be eaten?"

01:25:06.184 --> 01:25:09.937
I'm not gonna touch it.
I'm not going in that direction.

01:25:11.356 --> 01:25:12.606
Sounds impossible.

01:25:13.066 --> 01:25:14.399
It is impossible.

01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:18.028
You don't understand anything
about science.

01:25:18.196 --> 01:25:23.283
First off, there's a difference between
waves and particles. Duh.

01:25:23.451 --> 01:25:27.037
Second, the amount of power it
would take to convert energy in matter...

01:25:27.372 --> 01:25:28.997
...would be like nine atomic bombs.

01:25:29.207 --> 01:25:30.666
Mumbler!

01:25:31.501 --> 01:25:35.504
Seriously, I cannot understand
a single word you're saying.

01:25:39.092 --> 01:25:40.551
Okey-dokey.

01:25:40.718 --> 01:25:44.054
I shall now send a bar of chocolate
from one end of the room...

01:25:44.222 --> 01:25:47.307
...to the other by television.

01:25:47.475 --> 01:25:48.892
Bring in the chocolate.

01:26:09.664 --> 01:26:12.332
It's gotta be real big
because you know how on TV...

01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:15.878
...you can film a regular-size man,
and he comes out looking this tall?

01:26:16.045 --> 01:26:17.462
Same basic principle.

01:26:49.454 --> 01:26:51.038
It's gone.

01:26:51.998 --> 01:26:56.126
Told you. That chocolate is now rushing
through the air above our heads...

01:26:56.294 --> 01:26:58.754
...in a million tiny little pieces.

01:26:58.963 --> 01:27:01.798
Come over here.
Come on. Come on. Come on!

01:27:07.388 --> 01:27:09.139
Watch the screen.

01:27:12.518 --> 01:27:14.144
Here it comes.

01:27:15.230 --> 01:27:16.813
Oh, look.

01:27:20.902 --> 01:27:23.612
- Take it.
- It's just a picture on a screen.

01:27:24.572 --> 01:27:25.822
Scaredy-cat.

01:27:25.990 --> 01:27:27.491
You take it.

01:27:28.326 --> 01:27:30.619
Go on. Just reach out and grab it.

01:27:38.795 --> 01:27:40.295
Go on.

01:27:48.304 --> 01:27:50.138
Holy buckets.

01:27:53.142 --> 01:27:55.269
Eat it. Go on.

01:27:55.436 --> 01:27:57.604
It'll be delicious. It's the same bar.

01:27:57.772 --> 01:28:01.066
It's just gotten a little smaller
on the journey, that's all.

01:28:09.409 --> 01:28:10.909
It's great.

01:28:11.077 --> 01:28:12.452
It's a miracle.

01:28:14.247 --> 01:28:17.082
So imagine, you're sitting at home
watching television...

01:28:17.250 --> 01:28:21.003
...and suddenly a commercial will flash
onto the screen, and a voice will say:

01:28:21.170 --> 01:28:25.257
"Wonka's chocolates
are the best in the world.

01:28:25.425 --> 01:28:28.343
If you don't believe us,
try one for yourself. "

01:28:29.345 --> 01:28:32.931
And you simply reach out and take it.

01:28:33.850 --> 01:28:35.142
How about that?

01:28:35.310 --> 01:28:37.227
So can you send other things?

01:28:37.395 --> 01:28:39.187
Say, like, breakfast cereal?

01:28:39.564 --> 01:28:42.149
Do you have any idea
what breakfast cereal's made of?

01:28:42.317 --> 01:28:45.652
It's those little curly wooden shavings
you find in pencil sharpeners.

01:28:45.820 --> 01:28:47.946
But could you send it by TV
if you wanted to?

01:28:48.239 --> 01:28:50.240
- Of course I could.
- What about people?

01:28:50.616 --> 01:28:54.119
Well, why would I wanna send a person?
They don't taste very good at all.

01:28:54.287 --> 01:28:57.497
Don't you realize what you've invented?
It's a teleporter.

01:28:57.707 --> 01:29:00.667
It's the most important invention
in the history of the world.

01:29:00.835 --> 01:29:03.003
And all you think about is chocolate.

01:29:03.171 --> 01:29:04.379
Calm down, Mike.

01:29:04.589 --> 01:29:07.341
I think Mr. Wonka knows
what he's talking about.

01:29:07.508 --> 01:29:09.926
No, he doesn't. He has no idea.

01:29:10.094 --> 01:29:12.220
You think he's a genius,
but he's an idiot.

01:29:13.139 --> 01:29:14.890
But I'm not.

01:29:19.604 --> 01:29:21.104
Hey, little boy.

01:29:22.398 --> 01:29:24.107
Don't push my button.

01:30:05.525 --> 01:30:06.942
He's gone.

01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:09.903
Let's go check the television,
see what we get.

01:30:11.072 --> 01:30:13.448
I sure hope no part of him
gets left behind.

01:30:13.658 --> 01:30:14.866
What do you mean?

01:30:15.326 --> 01:30:19.746
Well, sometimes only half of
the little pieces find their way through.

01:30:20.915 --> 01:30:24.376
If you had to choose only one half
of your son, which one would it be?

01:30:24.669 --> 01:30:26.586
What kind of a question is that?

01:30:27.380 --> 01:30:30.465
No need to snap. Just a question.

01:30:31.300 --> 01:30:34.261
Try every channel.
I'm starting to feel a little anxious.

01:30:39.892 --> 01:30:41.685
- There he is.
- Mike.

01:30:42.353 --> 01:30:44.062
The most important thing

01:30:44.230 --> 01:30:45.480
That we've ever learned

01:30:45.690 --> 01:30:49.025
The most important thing we've learned
As far as children are concerned

01:30:49.193 --> 01:30:52.028
Is never, never let them near
The television set

01:30:52.196 --> 01:30:55.699
Or better still just don't install
The idiotic thing at all

01:30:56.701 --> 01:30:59.369
Never, never let them
Never, never let them

01:31:12.467 --> 01:31:15.510
Never, never let them

01:31:15.678 --> 01:31:17.471
It rots the senses in the head

01:31:17.638 --> 01:31:18.847
It keeps imagination dead

01:31:19.015 --> 01:31:20.515
It clogs and clutters up the mind

01:31:20.725 --> 01:31:22.309
It makes a child so dull and blind

01:31:22.477 --> 01:31:23.852
So dull, so dull

01:31:24.020 --> 01:31:27.022
He can no longer understand
A fairy tale, a fairyland

01:31:27.231 --> 01:31:28.773
A fairyland, a fairyland

01:31:28.983 --> 01:31:30.358
His brain becomes as soft as cheese

01:31:30.526 --> 01:31:32.027
His thinking powers rust and freeze

01:31:32.236 --> 01:31:35.447
He cannot think, he only sees

01:31:40.244 --> 01:31:43.205
Regarding little Mike Teavee

01:31:43.372 --> 01:31:45.999
We very much regret that we

01:31:46.542 --> 01:31:48.168
Regret that we

01:31:49.837 --> 01:31:51.421
Shall simply have to wait and see

01:31:51.589 --> 01:31:52.881
Wait and see, wait and see

01:31:53.049 --> 01:31:55.383
Wait and see, wait and see, wait and see

01:31:55.551 --> 01:31:56.885
We very much regret that we

01:31:57.053 --> 01:31:58.720
Shall simply have to wait and see

01:31:58.888 --> 01:32:00.722
If we can get him back his height

01:32:00.890 --> 01:32:03.475
But if we can't

01:32:03.643 --> 01:32:04.684
It serves him right

01:32:04.852 --> 01:32:06.394
Ew, somebody grab him.

01:32:06.562 --> 01:32:08.396
Help me.

01:32:09.106 --> 01:32:10.690
Help me.

01:32:11.609 --> 01:32:14.736
Oh, thank heavens.
He's completely unharmed.

01:32:14.904 --> 01:32:18.448
Unharmed?
What are you talking about?

01:32:21.285 --> 01:32:23.703
Just put me back in the other way.

01:32:23.871 --> 01:32:25.413
There is no other way.

01:32:25.581 --> 01:32:28.625
It's television, not telephone.
There's quite a difference.

01:32:28.834 --> 01:32:31.836
And what exactly do you propose
to do about it?

01:32:32.004 --> 01:32:33.088
I don't know.

01:32:34.048 --> 01:32:37.717
But young men are extremely springy.
They stretch like mad.

01:32:38.344 --> 01:32:41.429
- Let's go put him in the taffy puller.
- Taffy puller?

01:32:42.098 --> 01:32:43.431
Hey, that was my idea.

01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:46.935
Boy, is he gonna be skinny.

01:32:47.979 --> 01:32:49.563
Yeah.

01:32:49.730 --> 01:32:51.982
Taffy puller.

01:32:52.984 --> 01:32:55.443
I want you to take Mr. Teavee
and his...

01:32:56.821 --> 01:32:59.447
...little boy up to
the taffy puller, okay?

01:32:59.615 --> 01:33:01.408
Stretch him out.

01:33:12.211 --> 01:33:14.129
On with the tour.

01:33:23.014 --> 01:33:25.307
There's still so much left to see.

01:33:25.474 --> 01:33:28.018
Now, how many children are left?

01:33:30.730 --> 01:33:35.150
Mr. Wonka,
Charlie's the only one left now.

01:33:37.403 --> 01:33:38.862
You mean, you're the only one?

01:33:39.780 --> 01:33:41.448
Yes.

01:33:41.657 --> 01:33:42.991
What happened to the others?

01:33:47.538 --> 01:33:50.165
Oh, my dear boy,
but that means you've won.

01:33:50.374 --> 01:33:52.500
Oh, I do congratulate you. I really do.

01:33:52.668 --> 01:33:54.002
I'm absolutely delighted.

01:33:54.170 --> 01:33:56.713
I had a hunch right from the beginning.
Well done.

01:33:56.881 --> 01:33:58.882
Now, we mustn't dilly or dally.

01:33:59.050 --> 01:34:02.093
We have an enormous number
of things to do before the day's out.

01:34:02.261 --> 01:34:06.222
But luckily for us, we have the great
glass elevator to speed things along...

01:34:12.688 --> 01:34:13.980
Speed things along.

01:34:16.817 --> 01:34:18.401
Come on.

01:34:24.617 --> 01:34:26.910
"Up and Out"?
What kind of room is that?

01:34:27.453 --> 01:34:29.120
Hold on.

01:34:37.922 --> 01:34:39.547
Oh, my goodness.

01:34:39.715 --> 01:34:43.385
We're gonna need to go much faster,
otherwise we'll just never break through.

01:34:43.552 --> 01:34:45.095
Break through what?

01:34:45.346 --> 01:34:47.764
I've been longing to press
that button for years.

01:34:48.516 --> 01:34:51.267
Well, here we go. Up and out.

01:34:51.602 --> 01:34:54.020
- But do you really mean...?
- Yeah. I do.

01:34:54.188 --> 01:34:55.689
But it's made of glass.

01:34:55.856 --> 01:34:57.857
It'll smash into a million pieces.

01:35:33.477 --> 01:35:36.396
Augustus, please
don't eat your fingers.

01:35:36.564 --> 01:35:38.481
But I taste so good.

01:35:51.620 --> 01:35:54.080
Look, Mother.
I'm much more flexible now.

01:35:54.623 --> 01:35:57.125
Yes, but you're blue.

01:36:19.607 --> 01:36:22.317
Daddy, I want a flying glass elevator.

01:36:22.943 --> 01:36:26.404
Veruca, the only thing you're getting
today is a bath, and that's final.

01:36:26.572 --> 01:36:28.198
But I want it.

01:36:45.174 --> 01:36:47.050
Where do you live?

01:36:47.885 --> 01:36:50.053
Right over there. That little house.

01:36:55.351 --> 01:36:57.185
What time do you think
they'll be back?

01:36:57.353 --> 01:36:59.062
Hard to know, dear.

01:37:10.699 --> 01:37:13.326
I think there's someone at the door.

01:37:13.494 --> 01:37:15.286
Hi, Mom.

01:37:17.832 --> 01:37:20.083
Mom. Dad. We're back.

01:37:20.251 --> 01:37:21.918
Charlie.
Charlie.

01:37:23.295 --> 01:37:24.879
Goodness.

01:37:26.715 --> 01:37:29.425
This is Willy Wonka.
He gave us a ride home.

01:37:29.885 --> 01:37:31.302
I see that.

01:37:31.470 --> 01:37:33.471
You must be the boy's...

01:37:34.765 --> 01:37:37.308
- Parents?
- Yeah. That.

01:37:37.476 --> 01:37:40.395
He says Charlie's won something.

01:37:41.856 --> 01:37:43.231
Not just some something.

01:37:43.607 --> 01:37:47.527
The most "something" something
of any something that's ever been.

01:37:48.028 --> 01:37:50.864
I'm gonna give this little boy
my entire factory.

01:37:52.992 --> 01:37:55.076
You must be joking.

01:37:55.244 --> 01:37:56.536
No, really. It's true.

01:37:56.704 --> 01:38:00.164
Because you see, a few months ago,
I was having my semiannual haircut...

01:38:00.332 --> 01:38:03.626
...and I had the strangest revelation.

01:38:17.433 --> 01:38:19.267
In that one silver hair...

01:38:19.435 --> 01:38:21.978
...I saw reflected my life's work...

01:38:22.146 --> 01:38:25.565
...my factory,
my beloved Oompa-Loompas.

01:38:25.733 --> 01:38:28.651
Who would watch over them
after I was gone?

01:38:28.819 --> 01:38:30.612
I realized in that moment:

01:38:30.779 --> 01:38:33.281
I must find a heir.

01:38:34.825 --> 01:38:36.951
And I did, Charlie.

01:38:37.161 --> 01:38:38.494
You.

01:38:40.706 --> 01:38:42.790
That's why you sent out
the golden tickets.

01:38:43.417 --> 01:38:44.459
Uh-huh.

01:38:44.668 --> 01:38:46.502
What are Oompa-Loompas?

01:38:46.670 --> 01:38:48.671
I invited five children to the factory...

01:38:48.839 --> 01:38:51.674
...and the one who was the least rotten
would be the winner.

01:38:52.009 --> 01:38:53.468
That's you, Charlie.

01:38:53.928 --> 01:38:55.386
So, what do you say?

01:38:55.554 --> 01:38:59.223
Are you ready to leave all this behind
and come live with me at the factory?

01:38:59.391 --> 01:39:00.642
Sure. Of course.

01:39:00.809 --> 01:39:03.478
I mean, it's all right
if my family come too?

01:39:03.687 --> 01:39:05.939
Oh, my dear boy, of course they can't.

01:39:06.774 --> 01:39:08.483
You can't run a chocolate factory...

01:39:08.692 --> 01:39:11.986
...with a family hanging over you
like an old, dead goose. No offense.

01:39:12.196 --> 01:39:13.988
None taken, jerk.

01:39:16.075 --> 01:39:18.576
A chocolatier has to run free and solo.

01:39:18.744 --> 01:39:21.704
He has to follow his dreams.
Gosh darn the consequences.

01:39:23.207 --> 01:39:24.457
Look at me.

01:39:24.625 --> 01:39:27.210
I had no family,
and I'm a giant success.

01:39:28.504 --> 01:39:32.507
So if I go with you to the factory,
I won't ever see my family again?

01:39:32.716 --> 01:39:35.051
Yeah. Consider that a bonus.

01:39:37.721 --> 01:39:38.888
Then I'm not going.

01:39:40.015 --> 01:39:42.225
I wouldn't give up my family
for anything.

01:39:43.060 --> 01:39:44.978
Not for all the chocolate in the world.

01:39:47.523 --> 01:39:49.649
Oh, I see.

01:39:51.527 --> 01:39:53.444
That's weird.

01:39:56.573 --> 01:39:59.242
There's other candy too
besides chocolate.

01:40:00.244 --> 01:40:03.079
I'm sorry, Mr. Wonka.
I'm staying here.

01:40:05.874 --> 01:40:07.583
Wow.

01:40:09.920 --> 01:40:11.754
Well, that's just...

01:40:12.506 --> 01:40:14.465
...unexpected...

01:40:16.051 --> 01:40:17.677
...and weird.

01:40:24.768 --> 01:40:27.437
But I suppose, in that case, I'll just...

01:40:29.857 --> 01:40:31.149
Goodbye, then.

01:40:34.278 --> 01:40:35.778
Sure you won't change your mind?

01:40:38.407 --> 01:40:39.949
I'm sure.

01:40:49.293 --> 01:40:51.294
Okay. Bye.

01:41:12.941 --> 01:41:15.693
Things are going to get much better.

01:41:16.612 --> 01:41:19.363
And for once, Grandma Georgina...

01:41:19.531 --> 01:41:22.325
...knew exactly what
she was talking about.

01:41:23.077 --> 01:41:27.455
The next morning, Charlie helped
his parents fix the hole in the roof.

01:41:28.916 --> 01:41:31.959
Grandpa Joe spent the whole day
out of bed.

01:41:32.127 --> 01:41:33.961
He didn't feel tired at all.

01:41:35.839 --> 01:41:39.342
Charlie's father got a better job
at the toothpaste factory...

01:41:39.510 --> 01:41:43.054
...repairing the machine
that had replaced him.

01:41:44.848 --> 01:41:48.184
Things had never been better
for the Bucket family.

01:41:48.519 --> 01:41:52.105
The same could not be said
for Willy Wonka.

01:41:52.272 --> 01:41:54.482
I can't put my finger on it.

01:41:54.942 --> 01:41:57.193
Candy's the only thing
I was ever certain of...

01:41:57.361 --> 01:41:59.821
...and now I'm just not
certain at all.

01:41:59.988 --> 01:42:02.782
I don't know which flavors to make
or which ideas to try.

01:42:02.950 --> 01:42:05.618
I'm second-guessing myself,
which is nuts.

01:42:07.079 --> 01:42:10.164
I've always made whatever candy
I felt like, and I...

01:42:16.463 --> 01:42:18.422
That's just it, isn't it?

01:42:18.590 --> 01:42:23.136
I make the candy I feel like, but now
I feel terrible, so the candy's terrible.

01:42:24.304 --> 01:42:26.889
You're very good.

01:42:38.902 --> 01:42:40.820
Pity about that chocolate fellow,
Wendell... Walter.

01:42:42.531 --> 01:42:44.574
- Willy Wonka.
- That's the one.

01:42:45.284 --> 01:42:48.327
Says here in the paper his new candies
aren't selling very well.

01:42:48.912 --> 01:42:52.540
But I suppose maybe he's just
a rotten egg who deserves it.

01:42:52.708 --> 01:42:55.585
- Yep.
- Oh, really?

01:42:56.003 --> 01:42:58.045
You ever met him?

01:42:58.213 --> 01:42:59.839
I did.

01:43:00.007 --> 01:43:04.719
I thought he was great at first,
but then he didn't turn out so nice.

01:43:05.429 --> 01:43:07.346
He also has a funny haircut.

01:43:07.514 --> 01:43:08.848
I do not!

01:43:09.850 --> 01:43:12.727
- Why are you here?
- I don't feel so hot.

01:43:13.187 --> 01:43:15.563
What makes you feel better
when you feel terrible?

01:43:15.939 --> 01:43:17.356
My family.

01:43:17.524 --> 01:43:18.858
Ew.

01:43:21.111 --> 01:43:22.945
What do you have against my family?

01:43:23.697 --> 01:43:27.074
It's not just your family.
It's the whole idea of...

01:43:30.370 --> 01:43:32.413
They tell you what to do,
what not to do...

01:43:32.581 --> 01:43:35.041
...and it's not conducive
to a creative atmosphere.

01:43:35.626 --> 01:43:39.462
Usually they're just trying to protect you
because they love you.

01:43:41.465 --> 01:43:44.008
If you don't believe me,
you should ask.

01:43:44.176 --> 01:43:47.136
Ask who? My father?

01:43:47.554 --> 01:43:49.222
No way.

01:43:50.390 --> 01:43:51.474
At least, not by myself.

01:43:52.976 --> 01:43:54.268
You want me to go with you?

01:43:56.480 --> 01:44:00.775
Hey. Hey, what a good idea. Yeah!

01:44:03.487 --> 01:44:05.821
And you know what?
I've got transport...

01:44:09.701 --> 01:44:12.995
I have to be more careful
where I park this thing.

01:44:43.318 --> 01:44:45.861
I think we've got the wrong house.

01:45:00.419 --> 01:45:01.877
Do you have an appointment?

01:45:02.421 --> 01:45:04.547
No. But he's overdue.

01:45:07.843 --> 01:45:09.844
Open.

01:45:10.846 --> 01:45:15.766
Now, let's see what the damage is,
shall we?

01:45:56.350 --> 01:45:57.850
Heavens.

01:45:58.018 --> 01:46:01.187
I haven't seen bicuspids
like these since...

01:46:05.233 --> 01:46:07.109
Since...

01:46:16.328 --> 01:46:17.620
Willy?

01:46:19.456 --> 01:46:20.915
Hi, Dad.

01:46:31.927 --> 01:46:34.178
All these years...

01:46:34.930 --> 01:46:37.056
...and you haven't flossed.

01:46:39.142 --> 01:46:40.976
Not once.

01:47:06.169 --> 01:47:07.586
It was on this day...

01:47:07.796 --> 01:47:10.297
...that Willy Wonka
repeated his offer to Charlie...

01:47:10.465 --> 01:47:13.217
...who accepted on one condition.

01:47:13.385 --> 01:47:15.678
Sorry we're late.
We were brainstorming.

01:47:15.846 --> 01:47:17.805
Thought I heard thunder.

01:47:17.973 --> 01:47:21.600
- You staying for dinner, Willy?
- Yes, please.

01:47:22.060 --> 01:47:24.186
I'll shuffle the plates.

01:47:32.737 --> 01:47:36.031
You smell like peanuts.

01:47:36.408 --> 01:47:39.785
- I love peanuts.
- Oh, thank you.

01:47:39.953 --> 01:47:41.620
You smell like...

01:47:41.788 --> 01:47:43.622
...old people and soap.

01:47:46.501 --> 01:47:48.210
I like it.

01:47:52.799 --> 01:47:55.301
Elbows off the table, Charlie.

01:47:55.469 --> 01:47:57.845
How do you feel about
little raspberry kites?

01:47:58.013 --> 01:47:59.555
With licorice instead of string.

01:48:00.640 --> 01:48:04.143
- Boys, no business at the dinner table.
- Sorry, Mom.

01:48:04.728 --> 01:48:07.730
I think you're on to something,
though, Charlie.

01:48:19.493 --> 01:48:23.871
In the end Charlie Bucket
won a chocolate factory.

01:48:25.248 --> 01:48:29.919
But Willy Wonka got something
even better:

01:48:30.545 --> 01:48:33.047
A family.

01:48:34.382 --> 01:48:38.552
And one thing was absolutely certain:

01:48:38.970 --> 01:48:42.973
Life had never been sweeter.
