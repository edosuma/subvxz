that momentarily and yeah this is the

02:01.295 --> 02:07.294

it's lovely here they're very quiet very
peaceful a little bit too quiet actually

02:40.375 --> 02:46.415
hard to get used to it after living
next to a motorway for two years.

02:55.155 --> 03:01.774
So I'm just setting up my cameras I've got
my GoPro over here... camera on over here

editing split screen okay...

There we go...

03:10.975 --> 03:12.815

03:49.455 --> 03:50.974
Oh right so you've
not been here...

03:50.975 --> 03:53.295
Brand new, I've been
here for about 2 days.

03:53.415 --> 03:58.015
Yeah you've just only
just moved in...?

03:58.335 --> 04:01.111
Can I get you a tea or
a coffee or anything?

04:01.135 --> 04:06.335
No, no I can't stay long..

04:06.895 --> 04:09.175
So er... what do you do?

04:09.775 --> 04:13.735
Well I work at the university I

04:14.015 --> 04:18.015
Really? Small world yeah I do. I
work in the Comms department.

04:18.475 --> 04:22.174
I heard from Paul... you see I'm in
Admissions I'm friends with Paul

04:22.175 --> 04:23.894
Paul Adams, yeah
he's my manager.

04:23.895 --> 04:26.535
He told me you were
moving here actually.

04:27.215 --> 04:29.694
So a coincidence right?!

04:29.695 --> 04:30.855
Yeah! And you live next door?

04:31.335 --> 04:32.854
I know... I know!

04:32.855 --> 04:35.875
It'll be nice to see a friendly
face around the building...

04:36.175 --> 04:37.475
That's strange isn't it?

04:37.495 --> 04:38.535
Yeah, funny...

04:39.015 --> 04:42.595
Well look I'm not met anybody
around the area yet...

04:43.035 --> 04:45.835
so how would you like to come
out for a drink or something?

04:46.775 --> 04:49.414
Yeah that'd be really nice

04:49.415 --> 04:52.575
I'm only next door and it'd be
nice to get to know you a bit.

04:53.095 --> 04:56.074
Well I'll just I'll just
knock on in a day or two?

04:56.075 --> 04:57.375
That's be really great!

04:57.595 --> 04:58.635
Better be going

04:58.655 --> 05:00.734
oh actually as you're here...

05:00.735 --> 05:01.635
Oh yeah?

05:01.636 --> 05:04.464
Very random question but
I don't suppose you

05:04.476 --> 05:07.315
know the combination
to my outhouse lock?

05:07.475 --> 05:09.075
No...

05:09.235 --> 05:11.783
I didn't think you would
but whoever was here last

05:11.795 --> 05:14.355
changed the combination and
didn't tell the Landlord.

05:14.775 --> 05:16.355
He didn't leave a
note or anything?

05:16.935 --> 05:18.775
No... no. did you know them?

05:19.335 --> 05:24.814
No.. hardly at all really I mean I
bumped into him once or twice but no

05:24.815 --> 05:27.594
he kept himself to himself...

05:27.595 --> 05:28.475
Fair enough...

05:28.476 --> 05:31.316
Looks like you might have to get
someone to cut it open or something...

05:31.375 --> 05:33.375
Yeah, ah it's no big deal.

05:33.915 --> 05:35.195
Yeah ok alright...

05:35.355 --> 05:36.394
alright well I better be off okay oh you
forgot this is for you it's just a.

05:36.395 --> 05:39.755
Well I had better be off... Ooh I
nearly forgot, this is for you...

05:40.775 --> 05:42.874
It's a little welcome
gift really that's all...

05:42.875 --> 05:44.955
Oh you shouldn't have thank you.

05:45.155 --> 05:47.134
No, no it's not problem...

05:47.135 --> 05:49.495
It's silly really my
sister makes them...

05:49.755 --> 05:54.075
It's like a good luck
charm kinda thing...

05:54.415 --> 05:56.275
Thanks very much that's great!

05:56.475 --> 05:58.175
No worries, see you soon... bye.

05:58.275 --> 05:59.275
Bye.

06:05.635 --> 06:07.655
There we go...

06:14.715 --> 06:22.454
So that was nice I've just met Emma from
next door she apparently works in the

06:22.455 --> 06:25.995
same building as me as well quite a
strange coincidence but I suppose that's

06:26.005 --> 06:32.273
gonna happen now I'm in a smaller City
and she gave me this a good luck charm

06:32.274 --> 06:40.274
apparently smells rather strange a
little bit musty can't open it seems to

06:40.345 --> 06:48.035
be stitched together but I'm supposed to
hang this over the door so that's what

06:48.055 --> 06:52.275
I'll do. I'll throw it away
after she comes with dinner...

07:05.035 --> 07:08.595
I think, I think that
was from upstairs

07:11.455 --> 07:16.175
it's definitely a noise
coming from upstairs...

07:17.535 --> 07:19.695
Just check it's not in here.

07:26.655 --> 07:27.695
Okay...

07:29.295 --> 07:31.375
This is upstairs...

07:37.855 --> 07:38.855
Hello?

08:03.935 --> 08:06.895
I could have sworn
I made the bed...

08:19.375 --> 08:25.375
Absolutely convinced I
made the bed this morning.

08:31.495 --> 08:34.375
There it is again...

08:40.815 --> 08:45.095
It's moving... it's moving.

08:48.055 --> 08:49.575
Bathroom...

08:56.255 --> 08:59.215
Jesus... don't say we've
got mice again...!

08:59.535 --> 09:00.895
Please not again...

09:06.775 --> 09:07.775
Is it in here?

09:21.215 --> 09:22.415
Christ!

09:35.455 --> 09:39.775
It's just like that pouch
that Emma gave me.

09:40.655 --> 09:41.815
Filthy!

09:47.335 --> 09:55.335
Absolutely stinks only
one place for this.

09:56.695 --> 09:57.815
In the bin.

10:15.135 --> 10:18.535
The noise has stopped now...

10:32.735 --> 10:36.175
I've just had a very
odd experience...

10:36.775 --> 10:40.213
absolutely convinced there
was somebody upstairs

10:40.225 --> 10:43.674
and went to check but
there was no one there.

10:43.675 --> 10:51.675
But the bed... convinced I made the bed
this morning it was arranged in a sort of

10:51.935 --> 10:59.254
body shape I guess and then and there
was this noise coming from the attic

10:59.255 --> 11:05.453
well I say the attic as you could see was
tiny so nobody can get up there but very

11:05.454 --> 11:13.454
odd pouch thing you know like the one
Emma gave me like this one I just

11:14.425 --> 11:20.454
hope we don't have mice the last place
was absolutely infested and cost a

11:20.455 --> 11:26.814
fortune to get an exterminator around
I don't know it's probably nothing...

11:26.815 --> 11:32.855
I threw the thing away the
noise stopped so that's that

11:34.855 --> 11:40.894
okay the weather is getting pretty cold
now but there's still a good opportunity

11:40.895 --> 11:44.644
to go out and see some of the sights of
Nottingham... better do it now before I

11:44.645 --> 11:49.495
start work right I'll be
too busy so let's go.

11:52.755 --> 11:53.755
Okay!

12:07.235 --> 12:10.915
I'm just off the bus just walking
around the streets of Nottingham.

12:11.515 --> 12:14.755
Here I am by the Left Lion, this
is a famous Nottingham tradition

12:16.075 --> 12:19.275
just in the centre
of Nottingham now

12:41.975 --> 12:45.715
okay this is the famous
Robin Hood statue!

12:50.915 --> 12:54.573
I've been told to check
out the caves under the

12:54.585 --> 12:58.255
city so that's where I'm going now...
follow me.

13:34.335 --> 13:38.323
Heading back home now just
had a notification to say

13:38.335 --> 13:42.335
that my parcel has arrived
so going to pick that up.

13:44.795 --> 13:45.795
Typical...

13:49.055 --> 13:51.875
Left out in the rain
bloody Postman...

13:55.875 --> 13:57.895
Home sweet home.

13:59.655 --> 14:01.075
Okay so here it is.

14:01.555 --> 14:06.495
This was ordered a couple of days ago...
if I can get it open...

14:06.955 --> 14:14.955
basically this is the safe home camera
attachment this connects with my GoPro

14:17.995 --> 14:24.504
here and it turns into a home
surveillance kit CCTV so it detects any

14:24.505 --> 14:28.715
motion and I can check it
when I'm outside on my phone.

14:31.395 --> 14:32.835
Hi Jon how's it going?

14:34.835 --> 14:38.823
Yeah not bad thanks ok
good all settled in now

14:38.835 --> 14:42.835
really yeah I'll just
pottering around...

14:45.835 --> 14:51.675
yeah there it's nice... thanks for
help by the way yeah well you know...

14:52.295 --> 14:54.693
don't! He would be jealous
wouldn't he? Yeah

14:54.705 --> 14:57.115
I met one of my neighbours
actually..Emma.

14:57.515 --> 14:59.695
She seems very nice...

15:00.855 --> 15:05.875
she works in the same say
building as me actually...

15:08.155 --> 15:09.675
Small world isn't it?

15:15.195 --> 15:16.235
What's this?

15:24.195 --> 15:26.235
That's the cottage...

15:31.235 --> 15:33.235
That's me!

15:33.655 --> 15:35.015
Who's filming that?

15:41.555 --> 15:42.675
That's weird...

15:53.075 --> 15:54.335
So bizarre...

16:09.495 --> 16:13.035
That's definitely me...

16:13.515 --> 16:14.715
Who's filming it?

16:17.735 --> 16:21.335
That was earlier on
when I was outside

16:31.155 --> 16:38.374
no I I found this file on my computer
I I clicked on it and it's got video

16:38.375 --> 16:43.774
footage of the cottage...
it's on my hard drive

16:43.775 --> 16:51.775
no well who put it there then?
I don't know...

16:53.335 --> 16:57.711
No! Do you think I
should call the police?

16:57.735 --> 17:03.114
Yeah yeah I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm
holding up oh I'll call you later

17:03.115 --> 17:08.415
just... I dunno. Ok..bye

17:37.215 --> 17:40.523
okay I'm not imagining
this definitely sounded

17:40.535 --> 17:43.855
like somebody was walking
around upstairs...

17:44.815 --> 17:47.855
let's have a look...

18:01.375 --> 18:06.015
It sounded like someone was
walking across this floor...

18:08.675 --> 18:09.775
Well...

18:10.675 --> 18:13.363
I started this documentary
project as a bit of

18:13.375 --> 18:16.074
fun just a way to keep
my skills from going

18:16.075 --> 18:22.454
rusty until I start work but something's
definitely going on I heard footsteps

18:22.455 --> 18:27.535
again upstairs but there was
nothing there I don't know...

18:32.995 --> 18:35.163
It feels strange like
there's somebody there

18:35.175 --> 18:37.354
watching me I'm not
sure and this video

18:37.355 --> 18:40.694
file sent to my computer I have no idea
what's going on there it's like somebody

18:40.695 --> 18:48.695
sent it to me and hid it. It's odd...
it's mysterious what I'm gonna do is

18:49.935 --> 18:54.665
edit that footage into this documentary
see if we can get to the bottom of it

18:55.495 --> 18:58.075
see what's going on.

19:10.255 --> 19:18.255
It's about 3 a.m. and I can hear...
I can hear something

19:19.175 --> 19:27.175
tapping um I think it's
coming from outside.

19:34.535 --> 19:38.155
I think it's coming
from the window...

20:01.855 --> 20:05.695
I'm just checking outside.

20:16.335 --> 20:17.614
It's not outside..

20:17.615 --> 20:25.615
It's not coming from out there
it's definitely sleeting now...

20:32.015 --> 20:33.295
I think...

20:34.535 --> 20:42.135
maybe it's... maybe it's coming
from the front of the house...

20:44.815 --> 20:45.815
Okay...

20:48.175 --> 20:50.695
Okay everything's fine...

20:52.655 --> 20:57.015
I'm at the front house now...
there is nothing there...

21:00.695 --> 21:03.851
Okay I'm going to go...

21:03.875 --> 21:06.435
I think I'm just going
to go back to bed...

22:01.295 --> 22:09.295
I've had a terrible night's sleep I
just want to just hope that I'm just

22:16.075 --> 22:19.651
imagining all of this...

22:22.495 --> 22:23.495
Okay

22:26.335 --> 22:29.455
hang on I'm coming...

22:36.975 --> 22:39.695
Okay I'm coming hold on a sec...

22:42.335 --> 22:44.335
There's someone at
the door I think.

22:45.455 --> 22:47.855
The knocking seemed
to have stopped

22:49.695 --> 22:52.735
footprints

22:54.255 --> 23:01.695
what? Someone was walking
in their bare feet...

23:03.295 --> 23:05.695
What's going on?

23:08.175 --> 23:10.735
Somebody playing a joke on me...

23:12.015 --> 23:13.135
Ah there we go.

23:14.175 --> 23:15.215
Thermostat...

23:16.475 --> 23:17.475
Excellent...

23:31.855 --> 23:39.594
It has started snowing... there's some
footprints in the snow I don't know I

23:39.595 --> 23:43.275
know somebody's playing a joke on
me somebody's taking the piss...

23:45.355 --> 23:48.714
I had this really vivid
dream last night

23:48.715 --> 23:50.055
when I did get to sleep...

23:50.615 --> 23:55.455
I felt like there was somebody in
my room with me... watching me...

23:55.895 --> 23:58.775
I could see this white face...
floating.

24:13.835 --> 24:21.835
So this is my local park, lots of
people out today gosh it's freezing.

24:51.495 --> 24:59.375
Yeah... still snowing I've been out to
get stocked up on food and drink but...

24:59.995 --> 25:05.234
isn't really much point in going out. All
the roads blocked there's no buses or trams

25:05.235 --> 25:12.095
running so I'm pretty much
just stuck here for now.

26:20.075 --> 26:28.075
It's about 3AM I've just
been woken up by a noise...

26:31.015 --> 26:37.674
coming from... I dunno... the
stairs or directly outside the

26:37.675 --> 26:45.675
bedroom door, I'm not quite sure it's it
could be the snow is still snowing quite

26:46.405 --> 26:53.095
heavily I'm gonna go
check ...come with me.

26:58.595 --> 26:59.595
Okay...

27:02.615 --> 27:06.795
Okay there we go.

27:15.335 --> 27:23.335
Okay that's fine that's just the that's
just the nightlight, motion-sensitive

27:25.255 --> 27:27.871
it's okay

27:27.895 --> 27:35.815
okay it's just...
come on get a grip.

27:41.335 --> 27:43.735
I think it's just
my imagination...

27:49.055 --> 27:50.055
Yeah...

27:51.215 --> 27:52.215
Okay...

27:57.735 --> 27:58.735
Okay.

28:21.255 --> 28:24.603
Well it has stopped
snowing now but it's

28:24.615 --> 28:27.974
still about minus five
outside so looks like

28:27.975 --> 28:30.575
I'm stuck in here...

28:30.895 --> 28:32.575
Not that I'm complaining

28:35.655 --> 28:41.054
yeah the snow is great but gives me an
opportunity to catch up with my editing

28:41.055 --> 28:49.055
so that's what I'm gonna do now so
I'll check in with you later on.

29:28.775 --> 29:36.775
It's 3AM again and I've just
I've just had the same dream...

29:46.495 --> 29:54.495
the house is sinking again, strange
whistling noise exactly the same...

30:02.575 --> 30:09.095
I don't really know
what to make of it...

32:37.775 --> 32:41.095
It's definitely something there.

32:42.495 --> 32:43.495
Yeah...

32:46.295 --> 32:51.615
it's definitely something
in the digital glitch...

32:52.655 --> 32:53.935
Looks like a figure.

32:56.175 --> 33:00.055
White... white face
or something...

33:01.975 --> 33:04.975
This cameras too good.

33:07.655 --> 33:09.135
What's going on?

33:12.655 --> 33:15.535
This is very strange...
this is very strange now.

33:16.855 --> 33:18.415
What's going on?

36:08.695 --> 36:11.575
I don't know what's happening...

36:12.535 --> 36:16.215
I dunno, I dunno I dunno...

36:16.895 --> 36:20.335
The chair was upright...

36:21.535 --> 36:25.614
The lamp was upright, I came
back they were on the floor

36:25.615 --> 36:32.655
something had knocked them over I've
filmed it I am not imagining this.

36:35.295 --> 36:36.655
Okay...

36:37.495 --> 36:38.495
Okay...

36:54.295 --> 37:02.295
Okay so I've just set up my
night-vision camera in the corner of my

37:05.935 --> 37:12.975
room here we go, yeah and I'll keep that
on low resolution all night so hopefully

37:12.985 --> 37:20.985
it can I can record anything anything
that might happen in my room any

37:21.295 --> 37:24.535
disturbances...

37:27.135 --> 37:28.215
Right...

37:30.015 --> 37:31.415
I'm off to bed.

41:05.015 --> 41:12.655
I was just having the dream again
the same dream um sinking.

41:49.735 --> 41:57.735
Very strange... very strange dream. My
heads all over the place very foggy...

42:01.135 --> 42:05.735
I'm just going to
go out I think...

42:06.535 --> 42:08.655
Get some fresh air...

42:09.695 --> 42:11.215
Clear my head.

42:11.655 --> 42:12.775
See what...

42:38.975 --> 42:41.295
I don't know what
to make of this...

42:48.615 --> 42:49.615
Okay...

42:51.055 --> 42:56.535
This is the... nightlight.

42:57.895 --> 43:00.775
Must have fallen down
the stairs I dunno...

43:05.335 --> 43:11.495
I don't know what to think I'm just just
gonna go, I'm just gonna go I think...

43:56.135 --> 43:58.135
Ah feels good!

43:58.775 --> 44:01.215
Breath of fresh air...

44:01.975 --> 44:03.975
Outside of the house today...

44:04.855 --> 44:06.415
going around my local area.

44:06.695 --> 44:07.775
Local park.

44:08.535 --> 44:09.935
It's lovely.

44:10.895 --> 44:13.055
THere we are... it's quite nice!

44:14.615 --> 44:17.895
Thought I'd get some footage
for the documentary.

44:20.175 --> 44:23.415
I think that's Emma...

44:24.335 --> 44:26.215
Yeah, my neighbour.

44:26.615 --> 44:28.135
Hi! Emma...

44:28.495 --> 44:30.014
Yeah Nick... alright?

44:30.015 --> 44:31.011
How are you doing?

44:31.035 --> 44:32.335
Yeah good thanks...

44:32.975 --> 44:35.815
Just getting a breath of fresh air
before I get stuck into some work...

44:35.839 --> 44:36.839
Right okay...

44:37.015 --> 44:40.055
I need to finish for
tomorrow you're filming...?

44:40.455 --> 44:41.495
Yeah... sorry!

44:41.855 --> 44:46.175
It's second nature, I don't know
if I mentioned I'm a filmmaker...

44:46.855 --> 44:48.015
Oh right okay

44:48.335 --> 44:51.535
I'm getting some footage for this project
I'm doing before I start the day job.

44:51.915 --> 44:54.774
Okay, good idea! Am I
going to be in it?!

44:54.775 --> 44:57.215
Er... yeah I should ask your
permission shouldn't I?!

44:57.975 --> 44:59.335
If you don't mind,
if that's okay?

44:59.735 --> 45:03.415
Yeah! I mean I don't have
to sign my life away do I?

45:04.295 --> 45:05.615
Absolutely!

45:06.115 --> 45:07.115
Okay!

45:08.135 --> 45:12.014
Tonight, are you doing anything?

45:12.015 --> 45:13.855
Do you want to have
drinks perhaps?

45:14.175 --> 45:15.655
Yeah okay why not.

45:15.915 --> 45:17.495
Excellent... 7 O'Clock?

45:18.215 --> 45:19.335
7 sounds good...

45:19.535 --> 45:23.455
I can get this work finished, left it
all to the last minute as usual but...

45:23.775 --> 45:25.894
Yeah, 7 could work I reckon.

45:25.895 --> 45:26.935
Brilliant that's good.

45:27.335 --> 45:28.815
Ooh I could bring my cards.

45:29.215 --> 45:30.215
Cards?

45:30.655 --> 45:31.975
Yeah Tarot cards!

45:32.215 --> 45:37.895
Just a bit of fun of course but you
could film it for your documentary!

45:38.335 --> 45:39.615
It'd be lots of fun.

45:40.035 --> 45:42.355
Pretty strange actually...
tarot cards...

45:43.095 --> 45:44.875
yeah I mean...

45:45.275 --> 45:47.155
Go on! It'll be fun

45:47.575 --> 45:49.494
I've not done it for ages.

45:49.495 --> 45:52.595
Lots of weird things happening
at the cottage at the minute...

45:53.315 --> 45:54.315
Really?

45:54.475 --> 46:00.014
Yeah, chairs falling over lamps falling
over that kind of thing I know it sounds

46:00.015 --> 46:05.575
ridiculous it's just you know
I'm in a new place... strange.

46:07.815 --> 46:10.103
Not strange but I mean
I've been there for

46:10.115 --> 46:12.415
years and I've never seen
or heard anything...

46:13.135 --> 46:15.775
Hmmmn, yeah very odd...

46:16.135 --> 46:19.095
I think it's probably
just me being silly...

46:19.815 --> 46:20.815
You know?

46:21.375 --> 46:23.615
Alright, tarot cards and drinks!

46:24.055 --> 46:25.255
Yeah it'll be fun!

46:25.415 --> 46:26.455
Cool okay

46:26.655 --> 46:28.134
I'll see you soon

46:28.135 --> 46:29.135
I'll see you then... bye.

46:29.675 --> 46:30.675
Bye.

46:30.895 --> 46:31.935
That's Emma...

46:32.375 --> 46:39.615
Okay tarot cards...
just what I need.

46:50.255 --> 46:52.575
I think I'm a little bit lost...

46:56.815 --> 46:58.255
Ah... hang on.

47:26.575 --> 47:28.855
Somebody in the house...

47:31.015 --> 47:32.574
Fuck!

47:32.575 --> 47:34.815
Fuck, fuck there's
somebody in the house!

47:35.255 --> 47:37.775
There's somebody in the
house, I'm going home!

47:44.455 --> 47:48.443
There was definitely
a figure behind the

47:48.455 --> 47:52.455
curtain but I thought
the door was locked...

47:53.135 --> 47:54.535
Still locked...

47:55.095 --> 48:01.615
I definitely picked something up
somebody was here ...I dunno.

48:02.695 --> 48:04.615
Definitely being filmed...

48:06.855 --> 48:14.415
Nothing... I'm just going
to check upstairs.

48:19.175 --> 48:20.175
Okay...

48:24.055 --> 48:25.055
Okay...

48:26.975 --> 48:27.975
Okay...

48:28.495 --> 48:29.495
Okay...

48:30.895 --> 48:31.895
Okay...

48:35.695 --> 48:36.815
Nothing...

48:58.295 --> 48:59.495
What?!

49:15.495 --> 49:18.615
Okay okay.

49:19.975 --> 49:24.735
It's definitely a figure...
behind the curtain... definitely.

49:26.335 --> 49:27.855
That's impossible...

49:29.775 --> 49:34.095
I've just double-check everything,
the doors are locked.

49:35.375 --> 49:37.055
It's like somebody's...

49:38.095 --> 49:39.535
let themselves in...

49:55.615 --> 50:03.615
It doesn't make any sense okay now my
rational mind is telling me this is

50:06.695 --> 50:12.093
impossible there is there is no way that
can be a figure but there's a figure

50:12.094 --> 50:15.205
standing behind the curtain.

50:32.015 --> 50:37.031
Hello, hi... yes Sarah
hello thanks for

50:37.055 --> 50:44.414
calling back, everything's fine,
I just had a question about keys

50:44.415 --> 50:51.655
yeah... does anybody else have a set of
keys apart from me and the landlord?

50:52.495 --> 50:55.574
No no no nothing's happened...

50:55.575 --> 50:58.843
yeah and what about the
landlord, is he is

50:58.855 --> 51:02.135
he about? Is he coming
in to do some checks?

51:04.175 --> 51:09.334
Ah... he's out of
the country, okay

51:09.335 --> 51:16.895
no everything's fine thank
you um thanks okay, bye.

51:49.255 --> 51:51.455
Okay... okay...

51:53.455 --> 51:54.455
Okay...

51:57.375 --> 51:58.815
[Okay... okay..okay.

52:15.255 --> 52:16.775
Hi! Come in...

52:17.591 --> 52:18.591
Hi...

52:18.615 --> 52:20.854
Hello let me take your coat.

52:20.855 --> 52:22.575
Thank you... there you go.

52:23.095 --> 52:24.855
Just through there.

52:25.495 --> 52:27.415
Thanks... ooh

52:28.375 --> 52:30.455
you've been filming,
is that a camera?

52:31.455 --> 52:33.935
Oh yes this is my
home security system

52:34.175 --> 52:37.854
its voice and motion
activated, there we go

52:37.855 --> 52:40.431
basically I can keep an eye
on the house when I'm not in.

52:40.455 --> 52:41.455
Oh right!

52:41.495 --> 52:42.495
How clever.

52:42.535 --> 52:45.823
Yeah well as I was
saying a few strange

52:45.835 --> 52:49.135
occurrences recently
furniture moving around...

52:49.615 --> 52:54.094
things turning up in the wrong place,
perhaps the previous tenant was

52:54.095 --> 52:55.454
letting himself in...

52:55.455 --> 52:59.335
Oh my God! Was anything stolen?
Perhaps you should call the Police?

52:59.735 --> 53:02.535
No no, nothing was stolen...

53:03.055 --> 53:06.735
But you're worried. Worried
enough to get CCTV.

53:07.255 --> 53:08.375
Look sorry I'll turn it off.

53:08.399 --> 53:10.038
No, no don't be
silly honestly...

53:10.215 --> 53:11.455
it doesn't bother me it's fine.

53:11.655 --> 53:12.235
You're sure?

53:12.236 --> 53:13.715
Yeah yeah it's fine.

53:14.115 --> 53:17.043
I mean... lived here ages
and well the cottages

53:17.055 --> 53:19.995
are really quiet we
never had any trouble

53:20.215 --> 53:22.454
honestly it's just...

53:22.455 --> 53:25.855
You're probably just letting
your imagination run wild...

53:26.975 --> 53:29.415
Yeah... I guess you're right.

53:30.975 --> 53:33.615
Did you know much about
the previous tenant?

53:34.455 --> 53:37.855
No not really... He
was about your age...

53:38.335 --> 53:42.135
He hasn't been here very long it
was maybe here about two months.

53:42.615 --> 53:46.454
I think and then then the cottage was empty
for about five months before youmoved in.

53:46.455 --> 53:51.654
Five months?! The landlord said
it had been empty only a week!

53:51.655 --> 53:53.303
He was probably just
saying that so you

53:53.315 --> 53:54.975
wouldn't ask for lower rent...
or something.

53:55.375 --> 53:56.534
Heh, yeah...

53:56.535 --> 53:57.415
You know what they're like.

53:57.415 --> 53:58.415
Oh absolutely.

54:00.295 --> 54:05.055
Anyway you've been through a lot of
change I mean move to a new city...

54:05.335 --> 54:09.495
new job new house I mean it's
it's all very stressfull.

54:10.015 --> 54:14.454
Look, I've brought my tarot
cards let's have some fun.

54:14.455 --> 54:16.335
You get the dinks, I'll
get the Tarot cards out.

54:16.615 --> 54:17.895
Sounds like a plan!

54:18.695 --> 54:20.535
Drinks and Tarot...

54:20.695 --> 54:21.695
Uh huh.

54:21.775 --> 54:25.255
Well I've never really...

54:25.375 --> 54:27.134
done Tarot cards before..

54:27.135 --> 54:30.175
Oh you are in for a
treat I have to say!

54:30.935 --> 54:33.254
Yeah, Tarot is magical!

54:33.255 --> 54:35.975
Are you into all this
spiritualist stuff then?

54:40.895 --> 54:44.295
Yep I think we're recording...

54:44.795 --> 54:49.174
Okay... so these are my cards...

54:49.175 --> 54:50.695
Beautiful aren't they?

54:50.975 --> 54:53.151
Very nice, how long
have you had them?

54:53.175 --> 54:59.255
Oh along time, about 15 years I think...
okay you have to shuffle.

55:00.135 --> 55:02.094
So if I give those to you...

55:02.095 --> 55:03.215
I have to shuffle?

55:03.455 --> 55:07.135
Yeah I'll, take the camera you take
the cards... swap over for a bit.

55:07.315 --> 55:08.315
Okay.

55:08.555 --> 55:09.835
So... there we go...

55:10.175 --> 55:13.174
I'm not very good, how
long do I shuffle for?

55:13.175 --> 55:15.655
As long as you like the cards
will tell you when to stop.

55:16.175 --> 55:18.135
The cards will tell
me when to stop?

55:18.495 --> 55:19.735
You'll know.

55:23.895 --> 55:25.735
I can stop.

55:26.255 --> 55:27.455
Okay...

55:27.815 --> 55:28.815
Swap?

55:29.015 --> 55:30.015
Yes let's swap.

55:30.335 --> 55:31.615
Okay there we go...

55:31.975 --> 55:33.014
There we are...

55:33.015 --> 55:34.135
Right...

55:34.415 --> 55:41.255
okay so I am going to lay the cards out
into a pattern and this will give me

55:41.275 --> 55:46.435
your past, your present and
your future events okay?

55:46.815 --> 55:50.201
All right so we're gonna
start with your past,

55:50.213 --> 55:53.611
let's say we have the
four of swords...

55:53.635 --> 56:01.635
the eight of swords
and the hanged man.

56:02.695 --> 56:03.815
Right...

56:04.615 --> 56:06.455
what do they mean?

56:07.095 --> 56:08.255
Change.

56:08.695 --> 56:11.095
Now I know I know
this already but...

56:12.055 --> 56:16.375

coming from upstairs...

01:05:42.975 --> 01:05:46.415
It's the middle of the day
and there's something...

01:05:53.055 --> 01:05:54.095
Okay... okay.

01:06:03.595 --> 01:06:04.595

What?!

01:06:45.395 --> 01:06:47.653
I don't know if I'm
losing my mind or seeing

01:06:47.665 --> 01:06:49.935
things or if something's
actually here...

01:06:54.315 --> 01:06:56.455

argue with that...

01:07:08.535 --> 01:07:10.615
There's something going on...

01:07:15.795 --> 01:07:18.275
I'm going to go to
London for a few days

01:07:18.375 --> 01:07:21.295
I think I need to get a new place I
don't know I need to check my contract

01:07:21.319 --> 01:07:24.224

train leaving in about 45 minutes

01:07:24.225 --> 01:07:26.898

I'm gonna get some

01:07:26.910 --> 01:07:29.595
stuff into a bag I'm
gonna go to London.

01:07:38.755 --> 01:07:42.635

01:08:07.995 --> 01:08:11.955

stay on Jon's sofa
for a few days...

01:09:36.075 --> 01:09:37.675
