That's fine.

02:41.286 --> 02:42.787
I can warm it up for you.

02:43.788 --> 02:46.499
It's... It's okay.

We're serving lunch now.

02:50.670 --> 02:52.463
I'm good. Really.

02:54.966 --> 02:57.093
Can I at least freshen that for you?

03:01.556 --> 03:02.932
Yeah. Um...

03:04.392 --> 03:05.393
Thanks.

03:09.480 --> 03:12.233
Hi, Molly. It's, uh, me, Gene.

03:12.317 --> 03:15.320
This is your cell number. I'm sorry about that.

03:16.404 --> 03:19.282
Yeah, I'm fine. It was a false alarm.

03:19.365 --> 03:22.201
You know, um, turns out I was just dehydrated.

03:22.285 --> 03:24.245

04:13.753 --> 04:16.089

04:16.172 --> 04:19.300
So nobody at all?

No? Well, that's it, then. Um...

04:28.101 --> 04:30.853
Yeah, sure. I will.

Hey.

It is you. I thought it was you.

I wasn't all the way sure,

Back in the day, when I lived in Albuquerque
with my ex, I used to see you everywhere.

07:39.834 --> 07:44.714
You're on the billboards, on the TV,
I used to have one of your matchbooks.

07:44.797 --> 07:46.966

Um, sorry, I'm gonna-- I got to get back to work.

07:55.057 --> 07:58.728
Come on, man. That is not cool.

07:58.811 --> 08:03.191
I know who you are. You know who you are.
Let's just get past that.

08:06.569 --> 08:10.948
Don't worry about him. He's cool.
Heh. He just wanted to come along.

08:11.032 --> 08:13.493

08:13.576 --> 08:15.953
Sammy Hagar.

08:16.037 --> 08:18.122
He's even more famous than you.

08:20.082 --> 08:21.584
What do you want?

08:24.128 --> 08:25.796
I just want you to admit it.

08:30.051 --> 08:32.678
-I don't know what you're...
-Sure you do.

08:34.055 --> 08:34.889
Just say it.

08:37.725 --> 08:41.479
I-- I really don't know what...

08:41.562 --> 08:42.396
Come on.

08:47.276 --> 08:48.194

09:02.750 --> 09:04.669
Better call Saul.

09:04.752 --> 09:06.254
What?

09:06.337 --> 09:08.089
I-- I can't even hear that.

09:10.424 --> 09:11.759
Better call Saul.

09:13.719 --> 09:16.430
Once again and do the point.

09:20.101 --> 09:21.394
Better call Saul.

09:22.937 --> 09:24.146

09:40.329 --> 09:41.789

09:41.872 --> 09:44.208
you just call up Omaha United Cabs.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.510

11:20.304 --> 11:25.393

<i>And I wanna warn you it's gonna be</i>
<i>more expensive than the original.</i>

11:30.689 --> 11:34.360
-How expensive?
<i>-Double the price.</i>

11:34.985 --> 11:39.156
And we are still in
a cash-on-delivery situation. Uh...

11:39.240 --> 11:40.825
Will that be a problem?

11:40.908 --> 11:43.828
<i>No, no, it's fine.</i>

11:45.287 --> 11:48.666
-How hot are you?
<i>-I got made.</i>

11:49.750 --> 11:51.669
You got made? All right.

11:53.003 --> 11:56.132
<i>-Any official involvement?</i>
-No, not yet.

11:58.175 --> 12:01.595
<i>Pick up is going to be</i>
<i>in the same place you were dropped off.</i>

12:01.679 --> 12:04.140
<i>Do you remember where that is?</i>

12:04.223 --> 12:05.558
Yeah, I do.

12:09.061 --> 12:11.897
<i>All right, Mr. Takavic.</i>

12:12.690 --> 12:13.649
<i>Thursday.</i>

<i>Seven a.m.</i>

12:17.820 --> 12:18.904
<i>Same spot.</i>

12:20.906 --> 12:22.700
<i>You know the rest, am I right?</i>

12:27.288 --> 12:28.664
<i>Mr. Takavic?</i>

12:32.668 --> 12:33.502
<i>Still there?</i>

12:36.881 --> 12:38.466
I've changed my mind.

12:39.550 --> 12:42.261
<i>-Changed your mind?</i>
-Yeah.

12:43.637 --> 12:47.975
To be clear, you are not going forward with this?

12:50.686 --> 12:52.771
I'm gonna fix it myself.

14:12.643 --> 14:13.477
-Jimmy.
-Kim.

14:13.561 --> 14:15.229
-What are you...?
-Listen.

14:15.312 --> 14:19.024
I know this seems fast. It is fast, but I can see it.

14:19.108 --> 14:20.859
-You're changing your name?
-No!

14:20.943 --> 14:24.864
-Well, yes, but it's for my clients.
-You're gonna call yourself Saul Goodman?

14:24.947 --> 14:27.908
I'm already calling myself Saul Goodman.
We've talked about this.

14:27.992 --> 14:31.704
The skells who've been buying my phones,
sure as shooting, sooner or later,

14:31.787 --> 14:34.915
every last one of them is gonna find themselves
in the back of a squad car.

14:34.999 --> 14:38.210
How do I get them to call Jimmy McGill? I don't.

14:38.294 --> 14:42.256
I stay Saul Goodman,
they call the guy they already know.

14:42.339 --> 14:45.217
I thought I was wasting a year of my life.

14:45.301 --> 14:48.095
It wasn't a waste. It was for this. This is it.

14:48.178 --> 14:51.515
-When did you decide...?
-Just now! Back there! Boom! It just hit me!

14:51.599 --> 14:54.476
This is the way. Kim, it's gonna work.

14:55.477 --> 14:57.187
-I--
-I know, I know.

14:57.271 --> 15:01.108
All of a sudden, I've got it all figured out.
But I-- I do.

15:01.191 --> 15:02.818
This is right.

15:02.902 --> 15:07.531
So let me just-- I'll get this done,
and then we can talk about it, okay?

15:09.074 --> 15:09.909
I mean...

15:11.744 --> 15:14.872
unless, is there some angle
that I'm not seeing here?

15:14.955 --> 15:19.168
If you want me to slow my roll,
I can come back and do this another day.

15:22.963 --> 15:25.549
-If this is how you're really feeling...
-It is.

15:25.633 --> 15:28.761
-I say sure.
-Great. Five minutes max.

15:32.264 --> 15:33.599
Okay, where were we?

15:33.682 --> 15:36.477
Just that you need to sign the documents
with your legal name.

15:36.560 --> 15:40.564
-You got it.
-And all that's left is the notice of entry.

15:41.565 --> 15:46.111
Jimmy Saul Goodman...

15:48.197 --> 15:49.114
McGill.

15:52.201 --> 15:54.078
-Thank you, honey.
-Mm-hm.

15:56.789 --> 16:01.543
Werner Ziegler. Werner Ziegler.

16:01.627 --> 16:04.213
Werner Ziegler.

16:04.296 --> 16:06.173
Ziegler.

16:07.508 --> 16:11.845
You know how many Werner Zieglers
there are in Germany?

16:11.929 --> 16:13.389
Twenty-seven.

16:13.472 --> 16:16.850
Twenty-six now, according to Mrs. Ziegler.

16:19.853 --> 16:21.897
I told you, I never heard of the guy.

16:22.606 --> 16:24.274
What about "Michael"?

16:26.527 --> 16:29.405
Like I said, I only know the names
of two guys over there.

16:29.488 --> 16:32.199
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Victor and Tyrus.

16:34.410 --> 16:35.369
You.

16:36.870 --> 16:39.331
-Yeah?
-Werner Ziegler, you ever heard of that guy?

16:39.415 --> 16:41.959
Werner Ziegler?

16:42.042 --> 16:44.503
Uh... No.

16:44.586 --> 16:48.382
What about Michael?
He's a bald gringo. He's in the game.

16:51.885 --> 16:53.262
Okay.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.975
- You're good.
- Okay.

17:00.227 --> 17:04.857
South wall pouring concrete?

17:07.192 --> 17:09.903
What's he up to, man? What's he doing?

17:12.531 --> 17:15.784
So there's nothing new going on, huh?
Nothing different?

17:17.161 --> 17:20.539
-Like what?
-Like anything.

17:20.622 --> 17:22.124
Mm-mm.

17:25.335 --> 17:26.170
What?

17:32.051 --> 17:33.135
It's nothing.

17:37.556 --> 17:39.058
It's nothing, man.

17:39.141 --> 17:42.519
Couple of skells on Fourth have been complaining
that this stuff is stepped on.

17:42.603 --> 17:44.104
-Stepped on?
-Mm-hm.

17:45.105 --> 17:46.190
You hear that too?

17:48.233 --> 17:49.943
They say it's different.

17:50.027 --> 17:53.155
-Different how?
-Skells complain. It's what they do.

17:58.327 --> 17:59.203
Okay.

18:00.537 --> 18:01.580
Show me.

18:11.882 --> 18:15.135
Arlo, my man!

18:17.137 --> 18:19.223
-Yeah?
-Three.

18:19.306 --> 18:20.682
Let's see what you got.

19:18.824 --> 19:19.658
Hey!

19:21.034 --> 19:22.202
Wait! Whoa, whoa!

19:22.286 --> 19:25.164
Yo, <i>vato!</i> Yo!

19:25.247 --> 19:27.541
Yo, <i>vato</i>, where you going?

19:27.624 --> 19:29.585
You're not going in there.

19:29.668 --> 19:30.502
Yo!

19:45.475 --> 19:46.643
Mouse, it's okay.

20:08.582 --> 20:09.833
So where's the stuff?

20:15.797 --> 20:17.299
It's in the chair.

20:27.643 --> 20:29.436
What, this chair?

20:51.792 --> 20:54.920
This about the count? Because the count is good.

20:56.463 --> 20:57.714
You're holding cash?

20:59.675 --> 21:01.051
Yeah, I got it all right here.

21:02.219 --> 21:04.429
If you're holding my cash...

21:05.764 --> 21:08.225
what are you doing up here with my stuff?

21:25.867 --> 21:27.577
No one's stepping on it, man.

21:36.878 --> 21:41.800
We pick the stuff from the chicken farm,
we cut it, we split it and it lands here.

21:41.883 --> 21:43.302
I'm with it all the way.

21:44.845 --> 21:46.638
At his chicken farm...

21:48.140 --> 21:49.308
you pick it up how?

21:52.561 --> 21:55.522
He puts out 10 keys, I pick six.

21:55.605 --> 21:56.857
How do you pick them?

21:58.483 --> 22:01.611
I just pick different ones each time.
They're all the same.

22:04.156 --> 22:06.658
Okay, so these...

22:07.784 --> 22:09.036
These are okay.

22:10.078 --> 22:11.872
But these...

22:23.800 --> 22:25.344
This shit's not ours, man.

22:32.017 --> 22:33.185
Whoa.

22:34.186 --> 22:37.314
This is old-school beautiful.

22:38.356 --> 22:40.400
Yeah, you deserve it.

22:40.484 --> 22:44.404
-But, uh, JMM.
-Yeah.

22:44.488 --> 22:47.991
Sorry about that. I didn't know.
I got it for Jimmy McGill.

22:48.075 --> 22:50.202
Yeah, well, Jimmy loves it.

22:50.285 --> 22:52.287
And don't worry, I'm using it.

22:52.370 --> 22:57.209
If, uh, anybody says anything,
I'll just say JMM is my motto.

22:57.292 --> 22:58.835
-Your motto?
-Yeah.

22:59.836 --> 23:01.129
Justice...

23:03.131 --> 23:05.926
matters most.

23:06.009 --> 23:07.427
That's nice.

23:07.511 --> 23:09.805
There's also this.

23:09.888 --> 23:11.264
Oh.

23:14.935 --> 23:15.769
Oh, yeah.

23:17.479 --> 23:20.649
"World's second best lawyer. Again."

23:20.732 --> 23:23.235
That's the real mistake.
"World's second best lawyer."

23:23.318 --> 23:27.155
Because Saul Goodman is gonna give you
a run for your money.

23:27.239 --> 23:28.198
Bet he will.

23:31.284 --> 23:32.119
Thank you.

23:34.246 --> 23:35.288
For everything.

23:36.873 --> 23:37.707
Really.

23:44.214 --> 23:45.173
You know what?

23:45.257 --> 23:50.470
The real trick is gonna be to get my clients to know
that the cell-phone guy is now a lawyer.

23:50.554 --> 23:53.890
-Their lawyer.
-Yep, that'll be a trick.

23:59.146 --> 24:00.397
What I'm thinking is,

24:00.480 --> 24:03.191
see, I've still got almost a full pallet
of cell phones left,

24:03.275 --> 24:05.610
so why not run a promotion?

24:05.694 --> 24:09.531
I'll make a real event out of it.
I'll give them away, okay?

24:09.614 --> 24:12.826
And, uh, for added sweetener,

24:12.909 --> 24:15.078
limited time only,

24:15.162 --> 24:19.374
um, non-violent felonies, 50 percent off.

24:20.667 --> 24:25.547
You know, just like, uh, commit four felonies,
you get the fifth one free.

24:25.630 --> 24:29.843
And there will be friends and family too,
so you can share them around.

24:29.926 --> 24:30.886
Really?

24:32.137 --> 24:33.305
Yeah. I mean, it's just...

24:33.388 --> 24:37.976
Get people in the door,
once they're hooked, I will upsell them.

24:38.059 --> 24:43.106
Doesn't that sound like you're encouraging
these people to commit crimes?

24:43.190 --> 24:45.692
They don't need encouragement. Believe me.

24:45.775 --> 24:48.528
-One scoop or two?
-One.

24:48.612 --> 24:51.948
Kim, you don't know these assholes like I do.

24:52.032 --> 24:56.786
Rain or shine, these morons will be out there
doing stupid shit and getting arrested for it.

24:56.870 --> 24:58.872
Little discount won't make a bit of difference.

24:58.955 --> 25:01.166
Do you want sprinkles?
Because I'm having sprinkles.

25:01.249 --> 25:03.126
Uh, sure.

25:03.210 --> 25:06.713
I'm just worried about how this reflects on you.

25:10.383 --> 25:12.594
You know what, when you're right, you're right.

25:12.677 --> 25:17.140
What am I doing cutting prices?
Discount is a desperation move.

25:22.145 --> 25:23.480
See?

25:23.563 --> 25:27.734
This is why this works.
I go too far, and you pull me back.

25:31.947 --> 25:34.824
Don't you think you're selling yourself short?

25:34.908 --> 25:37.911
You worked so hard to get your license back...

25:37.994 --> 25:39.746
We worked.

25:39.829 --> 25:41.748
We worked, so why be...?

25:43.375 --> 25:45.126
Why--? Why this?

25:45.210 --> 25:46.628
It's perfect.

25:46.711 --> 25:49.839
They already know me, I know them.
What's not to love?

25:58.265 --> 26:01.101
Kim, I can't go back to being Jimmy McGill.

26:04.437 --> 26:08.984
Jimmy McGill, the lawyer,
is always gonna be Chuck McGill's loser brother.

26:09.067 --> 26:12.112
I'm done with that. That name is burned.

26:13.863 --> 26:16.825
This is a fresh start. This is how I move forward.

26:16.908 --> 26:18.368
And I like it.

26:24.249 --> 26:27.127
Sorry, it's-- I just can't see it.

26:29.170 --> 26:30.964
It's okay.

26:31.047 --> 26:31.881
You will.

27:19.387 --> 27:20.930
Did I keep you waiting?

27:21.931 --> 27:24.934
I was admiring Gustavo's establishment.

27:25.018 --> 27:27.937
It's tremendous.

27:28.021 --> 27:29.522
So many trucks.

27:33.610 --> 27:36.446
Are all those buildings really full of chickens?

27:36.529 --> 27:37.572
Please sit.

27:38.698 --> 27:40.825
There's a serious matter to discuss.

27:46.289 --> 27:47.499
Of course, Don Juan.

27:53.505 --> 27:57.801
You may have noticed
that some of the product is altered.

27:59.344 --> 28:00.762
Gustavo will explain.

28:04.265 --> 28:06.518
I have a confession to make.

28:08.353 --> 28:13.024
A man was working for me
on the legitimate side of my business.

28:14.901 --> 28:17.904
He was supervising a construction project.

28:17.987 --> 28:19.739
A German engineer.

28:19.823 --> 28:22.867
I think you know his name.

28:22.951 --> 28:24.327
Werner Ziegler.

28:26.204 --> 28:31.209
But through an oversight,
Ziegler became aware of our other activities.

28:31.292 --> 28:34.421
The temptation was too great for him to resist

28:34.504 --> 28:36.339
and he stole two keys of product.

28:37.507 --> 28:39.926
I believe you know the rest of the story.

28:40.009 --> 28:43.930
You know of Ziegler's escape,
you know that my man tracked him down.

28:45.265 --> 28:47.225
My shame...

28:48.685 --> 28:51.438
is not simply that I allowed this to happen...

28:52.647 --> 28:54.357
it's that I hid the truth.

28:54.441 --> 28:56.818
When I discovered what Ziegler had done,

28:56.901 --> 29:01.614
I replaced the stolen product
with methamphetamine I purchased locally.

29:01.698 --> 29:05.744
Some of this inferior product went
to your organization.

29:07.579 --> 29:08.830
And for that...

29:10.081 --> 29:12.584
I must apologize.

29:14.586 --> 29:15.712
Sincerely.

29:34.856 --> 29:36.816
What construction project?

29:38.985 --> 29:42.822
I mean, you said
the German was building something.

29:45.325 --> 29:46.159
What?

29:47.869 --> 29:48.995
Ah.

29:51.331 --> 29:53.917
It would be simpler for me to show you.

30:02.592 --> 30:08.223
When finished, this will be the most advanced
in-line chilling system in the Southwest.

30:08.306 --> 30:10.350
-A chicken freezer?
-Chiller.

30:10.433 --> 30:12.685
Our product is never frozen.

30:13.978 --> 30:17.565
These are Ziegler's men, working from his plans.

30:17.649 --> 30:21.152
As far as they're concerned,
their leader has gone home.

30:31.996 --> 30:34.958
Nothing was keeping you from sharing all this.

30:35.041 --> 30:36.835
A lot of trouble could have been avoided.

30:36.918 --> 30:40.213
Yes, there were any number
of misunderstandings.

30:40.296 --> 30:42.674
My man didn't know who was following him,

30:42.757 --> 30:47.220
and as a result, he went to great lengths
to conceal his activities.

30:47.303 --> 30:49.222
Your man...

30:49.305 --> 30:50.598
"Michael," is that right?

30:51.724 --> 30:52.684
Yes.

30:55.103 --> 30:57.689
That's not him, is it?

30:57.772 --> 30:59.440
It is.

30:59.524 --> 31:01.943
Well, I'd love to say hello if that's permitted.

31:03.820 --> 31:04.946
Most certainly.

31:12.287 --> 31:13.538
Michael.

31:29.888 --> 31:34.225
Michael, please meet my associate, Eduardo.

31:43.860 --> 31:46.654
What a pleasure. I've heard so much about you.

31:48.823 --> 31:50.909
-That right?
-Oh, yes.

31:55.121 --> 31:57.165
I'm gonna get back to it.

31:57.248 --> 31:58.291
Thank you, Michael.

31:59.334 --> 32:00.335
Well...

32:01.920 --> 32:03.588
That explains everything.

32:03.671 --> 32:06.591
- I'm glad you are satisfied.
- Listen to me.

32:08.051 --> 32:10.428
There must be no more trouble.

32:10.511 --> 32:14.599
You two must coexist. This is non-negotiable.

32:14.682 --> 32:17.101
Gustavo, there can be no more secrets.

32:17.185 --> 32:18.811
Yes.

32:18.895 --> 32:20.772
Don Eladio is not happy.

32:21.773 --> 32:24.525
Do you understand what I'm telling you?

32:24.609 --> 32:25.526
I do.

32:26.903 --> 32:28.279
Then we're done.

32:32.909 --> 32:36.788
You know, it's gonna be a very nice chiller.

32:38.873 --> 32:40.833
South wall's gonna look beautiful.

32:52.053 --> 32:53.846
Why are you in the North?

32:53.930 --> 32:56.516
To protect my family's interests.

32:57.475 --> 33:01.187
Following Gustavo's men? Spying on him?

33:01.270 --> 33:04.315
And this business at TravelWire. Messy.

33:04.399 --> 33:07.777
This is not how we conduct ourselves
this side of the border.

33:07.860 --> 33:11.322
Look. I apologize. It's my uncle's influence.

33:11.406 --> 33:13.241
You know what Hector's like.

33:13.324 --> 33:15.702
So suspicious, so unreasonable.

33:17.203 --> 33:21.165
Hector has this crazy idea in his head

33:21.249 --> 33:24.293
that somehow, the chicken man...

33:24.377 --> 33:27.797
might carry a grudge,
after he shot Fring's boyfriend in the head.

33:29.382 --> 33:33.720
You don't understand Gustavo.
With him, it's all business.

33:35.179 --> 33:36.347
All business?

33:38.266 --> 33:40.685
Like what happened in Santiago?
Was that business too?

33:43.104 --> 33:46.691
I need to know that this is done with.

33:51.404 --> 33:53.614
You trust Fring?

33:54.782 --> 33:58.870
He'll never be one of us, but he earns.

33:58.953 --> 34:03.583
As long as he brings in the dollars,
Eladio is happy.

34:03.666 --> 34:05.960
That's all that matters.

34:09.464 --> 34:11.549
Then there's nothing more to say.

34:16.137 --> 34:18.890
-Give my best to your uncle.
-I will.

34:37.450 --> 34:38.826
Come on. Let's just go.

34:58.971 --> 35:00.139
I see you.

35:02.809 --> 35:04.769
Let's bring your phones here.

35:04.852 --> 35:06.646
Just take it easy.

35:10.858 --> 35:12.276
Whoa! Whoa.

35:12.360 --> 35:13.694
Back up.

35:13.778 --> 35:15.404
There are plenty of phones.

35:15.488 --> 35:17.573
Plenty of phones.

35:19.951 --> 35:21.994
Sorry, can't help you, ladies.

35:22.078 --> 35:23.871
Everybody got to wait their turn.

35:25.873 --> 35:27.416
Here you go, buddy.

35:27.500 --> 35:29.127
Next.

35:29.210 --> 35:31.337
<i>Welcome, welcome. Take a load off.</i>

35:31.420 --> 35:33.965
Before we talk phones, let's talk you.

35:34.048 --> 35:36.467
I'm guessing from our brief acquaintance

35:36.551 --> 35:40.012
that you are a fella who, occasionally,
through no fault of your own,

35:40.096 --> 35:41.722
find yourself in a donnybrook or two.

35:43.474 --> 35:47.395
Yeah, a, uh, knuckle-duster. A fistfight.

35:47.478 --> 35:51.023
I'm thinking you might be someone who partakes

35:51.107 --> 35:53.109
of the herb of the earth.

35:53.192 --> 35:57.488
I'm guessing
that you ladies are popular with the fellas.

35:57.572 --> 36:00.199
And this could lead to a misunderstanding

36:00.283 --> 36:02.243
with the boys in blue.

36:02.326 --> 36:04.203
Say hello to my little friend.

36:04.287 --> 36:07.707
See right there, circled in red?
It's pre-programmed. Ready to go.

36:07.790 --> 36:10.626
Number one on the speed dial goes directly to me.

36:10.710 --> 36:14.005
You press that, and poof! I'm there.

36:14.088 --> 36:16.465
Next! Why call the cell-phone guy?

36:16.549 --> 36:18.259
Because I'm not just the cell-phone guy,

36:18.342 --> 36:20.636
I'm the lawyer who's gonna fight for you.

36:20.720 --> 36:23.347
You might find yourself
in possession of a few pieces

36:23.431 --> 36:24.807
of military ordinance, you know?

36:24.891 --> 36:28.561
RPGs, maybe a couple
of claymore mines in the trunk.

36:28.644 --> 36:31.772
Before you know it,
the other guy is bleeding out on the pavement

36:31.856 --> 36:34.483
and the cops are giving you the evil eye.

36:34.567 --> 36:38.529
It's just that people are always
looking over each other's shoulder.

36:38.613 --> 36:43.034
And you're not hurting anyone,
you know? Who doesn't wanna be...

36:45.369 --> 36:48.247
Next. Big fella outside,
his name's Huell Babineaux.

36:48.331 --> 36:50.958
Go ask Huell about me.
He was facing three years.

36:51.042 --> 36:52.460
He was facing six years.

36:52.543 --> 36:54.420
Eight years, down in Guadalupe.

36:54.503 --> 36:58.758
He was facing 25 years. Didn't do a single day.

36:58.841 --> 37:01.135
That's why he calls me the "Magic Man."

37:01.219 --> 37:04.513
I asked him not to call me that,
but he insists. Next!

37:04.597 --> 37:07.225
<i>Number one on the speed dial, that's your lifeline.</i>

37:07.308 --> 37:09.644
<i>Cops pick you up, threaten you,</i>
<i>look at you sideways,</i>

37:09.727 --> 37:11.854
you press that button and I'm there.

37:12.813 --> 37:14.315
Press number one...

37:14.398 --> 37:16.400
Zip your lip and press the button.

37:16.484 --> 37:18.236
Keep your mouth shut and press number one.

37:18.319 --> 37:19.487
Keep it charged. Poof!

37:19.570 --> 37:21.197
Poof! I'm there.

37:21.280 --> 37:23.074
<i>...at number one on the speed dial.</i>

37:23.157 --> 37:25.701
<i>It's your panic button. Press one on the speed dial.</i>

37:25.785 --> 37:27.245
<i>Ask him about the Magic Man.</i>

37:27.328 --> 37:28.454
<i>Speedy justice.</i>

37:28.537 --> 37:30.706
<i>Your friend Saul is there, I got your back.</i>

37:30.790 --> 37:32.583
<i>Twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week,</i>

37:32.667 --> 37:36.462
365 days a year. Press number one.
Speedy justice for you.

37:36.545 --> 37:37.797
<i>Just press one.</i>

37:37.880 --> 37:39.257
Here's your lifeline.

37:39.340 --> 37:40.716
Use in good health.

37:44.345 --> 37:47.932
Press number one and poof!
Saul Goodman is there.

37:51.686 --> 37:55.439
Folks, folks. Ladies and gents, boys and girls.

37:55.523 --> 37:56.983
Due to popular demand,

37:57.066 --> 37:59.944
I'm very sorry to say
we've given out our last phone.

38:00.027 --> 38:04.115
However, I'm still here for legal consultations.

38:04.198 --> 38:07.034
Free legal consultations.

38:07.118 --> 38:08.869
You know what? At least take a card.

38:08.953 --> 38:11.998
You meet the law, you want the law
to meet me. Whoa, whoa, whoa!

38:12.081 --> 38:14.834
You know what? Uh, since none of you
are getting phones tonight,

38:14.917 --> 38:17.795
how about a special discount?

38:18.838 --> 38:20.172
Ahem. Yeah. Um...

38:20.256 --> 38:22.717
For the next, uh, two weeks, um...

38:22.800 --> 38:28.180
non-violent felonies, 50 percent off. Yeah.

38:30.516 --> 38:31.851
Okay.

38:31.934 --> 38:34.186
-That's for you. Fifty percent off.
-I'll take one.

38:34.270 --> 38:35.980
Yeah, all right, now we got some takers.

38:36.063 --> 38:37.148
There you are.

38:38.149 --> 38:39.900
Fifty percent off.

38:39.984 --> 38:42.570
- Remember, 50 percent off. All right.
- For real?

38:43.779 --> 38:46.032
Very good. Yeah, yeah.

38:46.115 --> 38:47.658
Very good.

38:50.828 --> 38:52.747
Well done, Magic Man.

38:54.290 --> 38:55.791
We're just getting started.

39:29.241 --> 39:31.994
If you were gonna die, you'd be dead already.

39:32.078 --> 39:34.580
Now step out of the truck, we got things to do.

39:49.053 --> 39:49.929
All right.

39:50.846 --> 39:55.267
The job may only be half done,
but you're being paid in full.

39:55.351 --> 39:57.228
Does it need to be said...

39:57.311 --> 40:00.815
that your cooperation is expected to continue?

40:00.898 --> 40:02.942
Permanently.

40:03.025 --> 40:04.360
Not a word.

40:04.443 --> 40:07.613
Not today, not tomorrow, not next week, not ever.

40:09.073 --> 40:12.660
You let your end down,
there will be consequences.

40:12.743 --> 40:14.912
Is that understood by all?

40:16.455 --> 40:18.207
All right.

40:18.290 --> 40:20.167
Udo and Renke.

40:20.251 --> 40:23.254
You're in the Cherokee. Keys are inside.

40:23.337 --> 40:24.713
You're driving to Denver.

40:24.797 --> 40:27.341
Flight for Zurich leaves at midnight.

40:27.425 --> 40:29.009
You hang a right...

40:29.093 --> 40:31.762
you'll hit the main highway in four miles.

40:31.846 --> 40:33.556
Passports and tickets.

40:39.937 --> 40:41.272
Kai.

40:41.355 --> 40:43.858
You're traveling solo in the red Pontiac.

40:43.941 --> 40:48.195
You're flying out of Dallas. It is a long drive.

40:48.279 --> 40:51.490
Flight leaves at 9:40 direct to Berlin.

40:55.453 --> 40:56.996
I will never say anything.

40:58.122 --> 40:59.081
Ever.

41:04.378 --> 41:05.629
It had to be done.

41:07.298 --> 41:09.049
He was a good man, but...

41:10.426 --> 41:12.178
in truth he was...

41:12.261 --> 41:13.304
soft.

41:41.332 --> 41:43.083
Casper.

41:43.167 --> 41:44.668
Toyota.

41:44.752 --> 41:47.588
You're headed to Phoenix, 10:15 to Vancouver,

41:47.671 --> 41:49.673
then Vancouver to Budapest.

42:05.981 --> 42:06.815
Yeah?

42:11.654 --> 42:13.489
He was worth 50 of you.

42:31.090 --> 42:33.092
Sebastian, Adrian.

42:34.385 --> 42:35.427
The Civic.

42:37.054 --> 42:38.806
You're driving to El Paso.

42:40.599 --> 42:44.436
On the 7:25 to Chicago, then Chicago to Vienna.

43:07.001 --> 43:08.085
Well?

43:08.168 --> 43:11.171
Last of them got on a plane for Zurich an hour ago.

43:11.255 --> 43:12.298
No problem.

43:14.216 --> 43:16.385
Will they do as they've been told?

43:16.468 --> 43:18.887
-You're asking my opinion?
-I am.

43:20.472 --> 43:22.516
They know the consequences.

43:22.600 --> 43:23.726
And the laundry?

43:23.809 --> 43:27.605
Entrances to the site have been sealed.
Nobody's gonna stumble on it.

43:29.898 --> 43:32.443
As long as Lalo Salamanca is
on this side of the border,

43:32.526 --> 43:34.361
we cannot continue as we were.

43:35.362 --> 43:36.697
So this is it?

43:39.116 --> 43:41.910
No, this is not "it."

43:41.994 --> 43:47.583
Once Salamanca is dealt with,
and he will be dealt with,

43:47.666 --> 43:49.209
construction will resume.

43:50.461 --> 43:54.006
Until then, you will continue to be paid.

43:54.089 --> 43:55.299
Hmm.

43:56.634 --> 43:58.802
Now, you're gonna pay me to do nothing.

44:00.054 --> 44:01.847
Call it a retainer.

44:02.890 --> 44:05.225
-Even after Ziegler?
-Yes.

44:08.479 --> 44:11.106
What happened in Frankfurt?

44:11.190 --> 44:13.734
The attorney spent a full day with his wife.

44:14.735 --> 44:18.197
She accepted the facts as presented.

44:20.032 --> 44:24.495
As per your suggestion, "a construction accident."

44:24.578 --> 44:28.290
The funeral was yesterday. And of course...

44:28.374 --> 44:30.042
she has been compensated.

44:32.795 --> 44:34.171
"Compensated."

44:38.300 --> 44:42.429
I would choose my next words

44:42.513 --> 44:45.140
very carefully, if I were you.

44:47.851 --> 44:49.103
Hmm.

44:52.106 --> 44:54.483
You keep your goddamn retainer.

45:49.663 --> 45:51.582
Mr. Oakley, Mr. Oakley.

45:51.665 --> 45:54.293
Would you care to comment
on the Carl Gravenhorst case?

45:54.376 --> 45:55.252
Oh, I...

45:55.335 --> 45:57.921
As you know, the DA's Office has been
accused of misconduct

45:58.005 --> 45:59.131
in the Gravenhorst case.

45:59.214 --> 46:01.425
Would you comment on the latest development?

46:01.508 --> 46:02.593
Graven what?

46:02.676 --> 46:05.429
People are saying
you're prosecuting an innocent man.

46:05.512 --> 46:08.348
Does the DA's Office have something to hide?

46:08.432 --> 46:10.517
-Well, um--
-Excuse me, excuse me.

46:10.601 --> 46:12.060
Please let me through. Uh...

46:12.144 --> 46:14.354
That's my client you're talking about.

46:14.438 --> 46:16.148
-And you are?
-I'm Saul Goodman.

46:16.231 --> 46:18.692
And Carl Gravenhorst is 100 percent innocent.

46:18.775 --> 46:23.197
The Albuquerque DA's Office is perpetrating
an outrageous miscarriage of justice.

46:23.280 --> 46:25.282
-You're who?
-I'm Saul Goodman,

46:25.365 --> 46:29.244
and we are counter-suing you
and the Albuquerque DA's Office

46:29.328 --> 46:30.746
for malicious persecution,

46:30.829 --> 46:33.332
unlawful detention and abuse of process.

46:33.415 --> 46:34.333
Seriously?

46:34.416 --> 46:36.877
Yeah. We'll take this all the way
to the Supreme Court.

46:36.960 --> 46:38.337
By the time we're through,

46:38.420 --> 46:41.423
Carl Gravenhorst's name will be cleared
and we'll receive a settlement.

46:41.507 --> 46:42.633
A cash settlement.

46:42.716 --> 46:46.053
All right, enough. I've got to be in court.

46:46.136 --> 46:48.805
Go if you must. But know this:

46:48.889 --> 46:50.682
We will meet again.

46:50.766 --> 46:53.602
I'm sorry. What'd you say your name was?

46:53.685 --> 46:56.271
I'm Saul Goodman, and I make it my business

46:56.355 --> 47:01.068
to defend the citizens of Albuquerque
against injustices of every kind.

47:01.151 --> 47:04.029
-Wow, you must be really expensive though.
-Not at all.

47:04.112 --> 47:07.366
I believe every man, woman
and child deserves speedy justice

47:07.449 --> 47:08.742
at a price they can afford.

47:08.825 --> 47:11.995
Do you have a card? Not for me. For a friend.

47:12.079 --> 47:17.000
Yes. And please tell your friend
that, uh, I make no judgments

47:17.084 --> 47:19.878
and I'm available 24 hours a day.

47:19.962 --> 47:22.130
-Can I get one of those, sir?
-Oh, yeah.

47:23.465 --> 47:25.175
-What about me?
-Oh, sure.

47:26.552 --> 47:28.595
Okay. Wow.

47:31.014 --> 47:32.558
Yeah, I, uh...

47:32.641 --> 47:34.560
I just don't know...

47:34.643 --> 47:36.603
Five months.

47:36.687 --> 47:38.897
With overcrowding,
you'll probably do less than two.

47:40.524 --> 47:42.317
Yeah. Yeah.

47:42.401 --> 47:43.777
Considering your priors,

47:43.860 --> 47:49.449
sentencing guidelines would have you looking
at two to four years in custody, so...

47:50.492 --> 47:52.286
Five months is really good, Bobby.

47:56.164 --> 47:58.875
Are you worried about being there
when Lois delivers?

47:58.959 --> 48:00.002
Delivers...?

48:01.503 --> 48:03.589
Oh, right. Yes. Um...

48:03.672 --> 48:06.508
So if I go to trial, you'll be my lawyer, right?

48:07.509 --> 48:10.846
-Bobby, you do not want to go to trial.
-But you'll be my lawyer?

48:10.929 --> 48:13.765
Yes, but going to trial would be a mistake.

48:13.849 --> 48:15.601
Trials are always unpredictable.

48:15.684 --> 48:17.686
At trial, the DA will throw everything at us.

48:17.769 --> 48:19.980
-You'll be rolling the dice.
-Yeah, roll the dice.

48:20.063 --> 48:23.191
Yeah, I don't mean to tell you
your business, Miss Wexler,

48:23.275 --> 48:26.445
but you put me up there,
I give the people the big eyes,

48:26.528 --> 48:28.280
they see Lois here and the kid.

48:28.363 --> 48:30.574
-They're gonna believe me.
-I believe you.

48:31.825 --> 48:35.495
Bobby, there are a million reasons
not to go to trial.

48:36.913 --> 48:38.332
But it's up to me, right?

48:38.415 --> 48:41.668
Yes, it is, but I'm advising you not to.

48:41.752 --> 48:45.380
Odds are, you would end up going away
for more time, not less.

48:45.464 --> 48:47.924
And I'm talking about years of your life.

48:49.343 --> 48:51.845
But I might not. Right?

48:53.096 --> 48:55.349
-You don't want to take that risk.
-Maybe I do.

48:55.432 --> 48:56.892
Lois?

48:56.975 --> 48:58.560
Whatever Bobby says.

49:04.858 --> 49:07.194
Excuse me a moment. Please...

49:08.195 --> 49:10.238
think this over carefully.

49:10.322 --> 49:11.198
Both of you.

49:14.034 --> 49:15.452
You ready for lunch?

49:15.535 --> 49:19.247
There's a new sandwich vending machine
down by family court. I've heard good things.

49:19.331 --> 49:21.166
Sorry, I'm stuck here.

49:21.249 --> 49:23.293
Really? What's up?

49:23.377 --> 49:26.088
-He's not taking the deal.
-Who? That guy?

49:27.381 --> 49:29.257
Isn't he the punk who tried to sell

49:29.341 --> 49:32.427
a flatbed of hot mini-fridges to an undercover cop?

49:32.511 --> 49:33.512
What'd you get him?

49:33.595 --> 49:36.348
-Five months.
-Five months? With his priors?

49:36.431 --> 49:38.392
Well, he should be on his knees thanking you.

49:38.475 --> 49:40.060
I'm trying to talk him out of trial.

49:40.143 --> 49:41.561
No! Seriously?

49:41.645 --> 49:43.021
Seriously.

49:43.730 --> 49:44.815
You know what?

49:45.941 --> 49:47.192
No.

49:47.275 --> 49:48.694
No, we can fix this.

49:50.153 --> 49:52.948
I'm from the DA's Office, okay?
I'm giving you what for.

49:53.031 --> 49:54.866
You're giving me what for. We'll be loud.

49:54.950 --> 49:58.537
We will go over there,
we will make a scene, okay? Uh...

49:58.620 --> 50:03.291
New evidence has come to light,
and I'm pulling his deal with extreme prejudice.

50:03.375 --> 50:07.003
I'm pissed! I want to put him away permanently.

50:08.213 --> 50:09.631
The guy came back in.

50:12.884 --> 50:15.512
You fight me, I will push back hard.

50:15.595 --> 50:18.724
We'll have that punk on his knees,
begging for the five months.

50:22.978 --> 50:25.272
-I don't think so.
-Come on, Kim. We can do this.

50:25.355 --> 50:28.108
-Lead-pipe cinch.
-He's the client, it's his decision.

50:28.191 --> 50:31.653
What good is it gonna do,
you put that dweeb away in Los Lunas?

50:31.737 --> 50:33.238
You think he's a jackass now?

50:33.321 --> 50:35.866
Wait till he gets back from that clown college.

50:35.949 --> 50:37.159
Jimmy, no.

50:37.242 --> 50:39.745
What about his wife and kid.
That's them? What about them?

50:39.828 --> 50:42.205
If this isn't using our powers for good,
I don't know what is.

50:42.289 --> 50:44.332
-We're not doing that.
-But, Kim, we could do it!

50:44.416 --> 50:46.918
-I'm not scamming my client.
-It worked for Mesa Verde.

50:47.002 --> 50:48.211
Jimmy. Back off.

50:50.213 --> 50:51.465
We can't...

50:52.466 --> 50:53.925
Okay.

50:57.345 --> 50:59.014
Um...

50:59.097 --> 51:00.474
Yeah, I'll see you at home.

51:16.031 --> 51:17.657
So...

51:17.741 --> 51:18.700
who was that?

51:21.995 --> 51:23.455
Is everything all right?

51:29.461 --> 51:31.421
He's from the District Attorney's Office.

51:32.672 --> 51:34.424
They're taking the deal off the table.

51:35.842 --> 51:40.555
So what? I mean, we weren't
gonna take it anyway, so...

51:40.639 --> 51:43.141
Miss Wexler, why are they taking it off the table?

51:44.226 --> 51:45.727
I...

51:45.811 --> 51:47.979
don't know for sure.

51:48.063 --> 51:50.941
It's possible they have new evidence.

51:55.111 --> 51:57.531
Like-- Like what? Like...

51:57.614 --> 52:00.367
Cameras or witnesses? Or...?

52:00.450 --> 52:01.785
I really couldn't say.

52:03.703 --> 52:05.622
We'll find out soon enough.

52:07.666 --> 52:08.959
Bobby, I'm sorry.

52:10.710 --> 52:12.963
It looks like they want
to make an example out of you.

52:14.881 --> 52:15.841
Uh...

52:16.842 --> 52:18.426
All right, well...

52:18.510 --> 52:21.429
We better go tell the judge
that we're taking this to trial.

52:21.513 --> 52:23.390
Yeah, you know what? Um...

52:23.473 --> 52:26.434
Are you sure we still can't get the five months?

52:27.561 --> 52:29.521
The DA took that off the table.

52:29.604 --> 52:32.232
You mean if you-- Even if you ask real nice?

52:37.404 --> 52:39.114
I could try.

52:40.198 --> 52:43.410
-Are you sure that's what you want?
-Yeah, I thought about it,

52:43.493 --> 52:45.287
just like you said, and...

52:45.370 --> 52:46.621
I could do the five months.

52:48.665 --> 52:50.542
Miss Wexler, please.

52:58.800 --> 53:00.552
Wait here.

53:00.635 --> 53:03.263
I can't promise anything, but...

53:03.346 --> 53:04.973
-I'll look into it.
-Sure, sure.

53:05.056 --> 53:06.224
You do that.

53:07.559 --> 53:08.768
We'll be right here.
