WEBVTT

00:01.068 --> 00:07.655
reads words on screen

00:12.241 --> 00:13.827
Yeah, okay.

00:13.862 --> 00:14.724
No no no,
hold on.

00:14.758 --> 00:15.827
I'm heading
into the shop.

00:16.448 --> 00:17.344
Okay.

00:23.379 --> 00:24.620
There you are.

00:24.655 --> 00:26.103
You don't have
to come here!

00:26.137 --> 00:27.344
You're sure?

00:27.379 --> 00:29.241
Me see you run round like a
chicken with its head cut off.

00:30.551 --> 00:32.758
Me think me should have come up
there to Newfoundland after all.

00:32.793 --> 00:33.689
No, no.

00:33.724 --> 00:35.448
I know you no
like the cold!

00:35.482 --> 00:36.862
But it would have been
a good opportunity-

00:36.896 --> 00:38.413
for me to learn your
end of the business.

00:38.448 --> 00:42.000
You do great for the
business in Jamaica.

00:42.034 --> 00:43.103
Next time-

00:43.137 --> 00:44.448
I come
there, okay?

00:44.482 --> 00:45.689
Ah, me like to
hear you say-

00:45.724 --> 00:47.724
there going to
be a next time.

00:47.758 --> 00:48.655
Serious now.

00:48.689 --> 00:50.379
You've been working
non-stop for what?

00:50.413 --> 00:51.344
Four years now?

00:51.379 --> 00:53.275
You deserve the break.

00:53.310 --> 00:55.379
The order is ready
for pickup.

00:55.413 --> 00:57.034
This shipment should
clear Mo'Bay tomorrow.

00:57.068 --> 00:58.000
Check.

00:58.034 --> 00:58.896
Two of the
three accountants-

00:58.931 --> 01:00.137
have confirmed.

01:00.172 --> 01:01.931
I'll send you the resumes
and Skype links.

01:01.965 --> 01:03.551
Check check.

01:03.586 --> 01:04.965
Oh Lord.

01:05.448 --> 01:07.172
Oh, I sorry Toni.

01:07.206 --> 01:08.344
Nah, nah I joke.

01:08.379 --> 01:09.517
It's not forever.

01:09.551 --> 01:11.275
Things are not
going to fall apart!

01:11.310 --> 01:13.000
And you need to get
your butt in gear!

01:13.034 --> 01:14.000
Okay, I go.

01:14.034 --> 01:14.827
I go.

01:16.275 --> 01:18.275
You nah need that at your
bougie Costa Rican retreat.

01:18.310 --> 01:20.068
Okay, I'll leave
it inna me car!

01:20.103 --> 01:22.517
Now woman, you nah
want miss your flight.

01:22.551 --> 01:23.827
Okay, just one
more quick stop.

01:23.862 --> 01:25.827
What can be that
important, Kadi?

01:25.862 --> 01:27.896
Just a loose end.

01:27.931 --> 01:28.896
And then I promise-

01:28.931 --> 01:32.310
I'll be off the grid
for two glorious weeks.

01:32.344 --> 01:34.379
Safe travels my sister.

01:34.413 --> 01:35.482
Text when you land.

01:35.517 --> 01:37.172
I love you girl.

01:37.206 --> 01:40.896
Now, bring on those sunrise
meditations and sunset surfing!

02:51.310 --> 02:53.689
According to the flight's
manifest, the shipment-

02:53.724 --> 02:54.586
containing this crate-

02:54.620 --> 02:56.241
left St. John's
International-

02:56.931 --> 02:57.655
two days ago-

02:57.689 --> 02:58.827
at 7:30 A.M.-

02:58.862 --> 03:00.965
was unloaded at
Sangster International-

03:01.000 --> 03:01.862
in Montego Bay-

03:01.896 --> 03:03.310
six hours later.

03:03.344 --> 03:04.586
Jamaican customs officials-

03:04.620 --> 03:07.206
are certain that this crate was
not tampered with on their end.

03:07.241 --> 03:10.206
Any chance the person that
this belongs to is still alive?

03:10.241 --> 03:11.551
I'd say not.

03:11.586 --> 03:14.620
The hand appears to have
been severed post mortem-

03:14.655 --> 03:16.551
due to the clean,
sharp edges-

03:16.586 --> 03:17.620
with no soft tissue hemorrhaging.

03:17.655 --> 03:19.241
Karma?

03:19.275 --> 03:21.379
There's no sign
of inflammation.

03:21.413 --> 03:23.275
Which means that the
remains we're looking for-

03:23.310 --> 03:24.448
could still be
in Newfoundland.

03:24.965 --> 03:28.931
Based on size,
fingernails, and this-

03:28.965 --> 03:31.137
we're looking for
a female victim.

03:31.172 --> 03:32.379
Poor creature.

03:32.413 --> 03:35.379
It was shipped from
Honest to Cod on Water Street.

03:35.413 --> 03:37.241
Honest to Cod?

03:37.275 --> 03:38.620
I know that place.

03:38.655 --> 03:40.620
It's a salt fish company
down at the harbour.

03:40.655 --> 03:42.448
It's run by a
pair of sisters.

03:42.482 --> 03:43.413
Kadi Barrett-

03:43.448 --> 03:44.241
who works here.

03:44.275 --> 03:45.655
And her sister Toni-

03:45.689 --> 03:46.793
who works out
of Jamaica.

03:46.827 --> 03:48.000
Okay.

03:48.034 --> 03:49.655
Well we'll treat the shop
as a potential crime scene.

03:49.689 --> 03:50.551
Will I meet
you there?

03:50.586 --> 03:51.793
Yeah, I'm right
behind you.

03:51.827 --> 03:52.655
Come on pal.

03:52.689 --> 03:53.655
Yeah, just
keep me posted.

03:53.689 --> 03:54.379
Okay.

03:59.517 --> 04:00.551
This is custom.

04:01.517 --> 04:03.344
See, the wedding and
engagement rings-

04:03.379 --> 04:04.793
have been soldered together.

04:04.827 --> 04:05.827
Looks like an heirloom.

04:05.862 --> 04:07.413
Oh, it's a
special piece.

04:08.931 --> 04:09.793
Okay.

04:11.517 --> 04:12.965
I'll take the prints.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.379
And then-

04:14.413 --> 04:15.931
this is all
yours to process.

04:15.965 --> 04:16.620
Great.

04:33.172 --> 04:34.931
Hey, so according
to the manager-

04:34.965 --> 04:37.275
Kadi Barrett is on
vacation in Costa Rica.

04:37.310 --> 04:39.379
They packed up the shipment
the day before she left.

04:39.413 --> 04:41.551
Ten crates were picked
up the next morning.

04:41.586 --> 04:43.724
Nothing out of the
ordinary during or since.

04:43.758 --> 04:45.241
My team found no
blood on the premises.

04:45.275 --> 04:46.241
And Rex agrees
with them.

04:48.517 --> 04:49.413
What's
going on here?

04:49.448 --> 04:50.275
Let me through!

04:51.724 --> 04:53.310
Can you tell me
what's going on?

04:53.344 --> 04:54.896
No sign of
forced entry.

04:54.931 --> 04:56.482
There's keyless
entry on both doors.

04:56.517 --> 04:57.551
Mm-hmm.

04:57.586 --> 04:59.586
Well, the victim was
likely killed elsewhere.

05:00.931 --> 05:02.862
Whoever shipped the hand
likely had had the entry code.

05:02.896 --> 05:05.103
Please, you
have to let me pass.

05:05.137 --> 05:06.689
This is my place.

05:06.724 --> 05:08.034
You don't understand.

05:08.068 --> 05:09.137
I am the owner!

05:10.413 --> 05:12.000
Has anyone talked to the owner
since she left on vacation?

05:12.034 --> 05:13.241
No, Kadi Barrett
is likely the victim.

05:13.931 --> 05:14.586
I'll um-

05:20.103 --> 05:21.896
Let me speak to
whoever's in charge here.

05:21.931 --> 05:23.655
This is my business!

05:23.689 --> 05:24.482
It's okay Officer.

05:24.517 --> 05:26.000
We have this.

05:26.034 --> 05:27.655
I'm Detective Hudson.

05:27.689 --> 05:28.965
And this is
Dr. Truong.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.344
And my partner Rex.

05:31.413 --> 05:32.586
Are you Kadi Barrett?

05:32.620 --> 05:34.344
I'm her sister,
Toni London.

05:34.448 --> 05:35.793
Kadi's on vacation.

05:35.827 --> 05:37.206
I promised her I'd take
care of everything-

05:37.241 --> 05:38.413
from our Jamaican office.

05:38.448 --> 05:39.931
You just came
from Jamaica?

05:39.965 --> 05:42.172
I came as soon as I
heard about the package.

05:42.206 --> 05:43.517
But I'm confused.

05:43.551 --> 05:46.413
All the customs officials
told me was human remains.

05:46.448 --> 05:48.379
I thought maybe-

05:48.413 --> 05:49.620
an industrial accident?

05:49.655 --> 05:50.931
What's happened?

05:50.965 --> 05:53.448
Would you mind coming down to
the station with us, Ms. London?

05:58.551 --> 05:59.620
So you
and your sister-

05:59.655 --> 06:01.275
have been running this
business for some time now?

06:02.103 --> 06:03.000
Two years.

06:03.034 --> 06:05.172
And growing
all the time.

06:05.206 --> 06:06.310
Our countries-

06:06.344 --> 06:08.344
have a long-standing
connection.

06:08.379 --> 06:12.482
Saltfish has been a staple
of our diet since the 1800s.

06:12.517 --> 06:14.000
Of course.

06:14.034 --> 06:15.413
Slave owners
used to use it-

06:15.448 --> 06:18.068
as a cheap source of
protein to feed their slaves.

06:18.103 --> 06:19.931
And when you all
were under prohibition-

06:19.965 --> 06:22.724
my ancestors would
trade rum for cod.

06:22.758 --> 06:23.482
Mmmm.

06:23.517 --> 06:24.689
Old school smuggling.

06:24.724 --> 06:26.137
Those old-timers
were creative.

06:26.724 --> 06:28.000
140-proof-

06:28.034 --> 06:29.241
would sit in barrels-

06:29.275 --> 06:30.448
until the wood
absorbed the alcohol.

06:30.482 --> 06:32.241
And they'd ship the
empty barrels up North-

06:32.275 --> 06:33.896
fill them with
hot water, and-

06:33.931 --> 06:35.275
Couple of weeks later-

06:35.310 --> 06:36.448
they'd have some potent-

06:36.482 --> 06:37.310
what do
you call it?

06:37.344 --> 06:38.758
Swish.

06:38.793 --> 06:39.758
That's right.

06:45.655 --> 06:46.310
Ms. London.

06:46.344 --> 06:48.068
When was
the last time-

06:48.103 --> 06:49.586
you spoke with
your sister?

06:49.620 --> 06:50.448
Mmmm.

06:50.482 --> 06:51.965
A few days ago.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.931
Before she left
for Costa Rica.

06:53.965 --> 06:56.103
It's not too strange
we can't reach her.

06:56.137 --> 06:58.172
You know, she
went one of these-

06:58.206 --> 07:00.551
digital detox retreats.

07:00.586 --> 07:02.379
Hand over your phone
when you arrive.

07:02.413 --> 07:05.482
I promised her I would
take care of everything.

07:05.517 --> 07:06.793
I'm supposed to
be interviewing-

07:06.827 --> 07:08.344
for a new accountant.

07:08.379 --> 07:10.896
Ready to go when
she gets back.

07:12.103 --> 07:14.310
Our team
spoke with the airline.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.517
Kadi didn't get on
her flight to Costa Rica.

07:18.275 --> 07:20.896
You also haven't asked
us what we found.

07:22.931 --> 07:24.379
Do I want
to know?

07:24.620 --> 07:25.758
Ms. London.

07:25.793 --> 07:28.000
We found a woman's hand inside
the Honest to Cod crate.

07:29.551 --> 07:31.310
And this
woman is dead?

07:31.758 --> 07:33.655
We have reason
to believe so, yes.

07:34.758 --> 07:36.827
You think it's Kadi?

07:39.206 --> 07:40.103
Ms. London.

07:40.137 --> 07:41.379
Do you recognize
this ring?

07:46.379 --> 07:48.206
[crying] It
was my mother's.

07:51.206 --> 07:52.655
Kadi wears it.

07:56.275 --> 07:57.724
How did this
happen?

07:59.862 --> 08:01.517
And where is
the rest of her?

08:03.413 --> 08:04.620
Ms. London.

08:05.137 --> 08:07.517
We intend to find out the
answers to your questions.

08:25.517 --> 08:26.275
Yeah.

08:28.655 --> 08:30.517
That's not
an easy notification-

08:30.551 --> 08:32.241
especially with
so few details.

08:32.275 --> 08:33.172
Yeah.

08:33.206 --> 08:34.586
I want to find
her sister for her.

08:37.931 --> 08:38.551
Really?

08:38.586 --> 08:39.724
Okay.

08:39.758 --> 08:41.137
So we can establish a
window for the time of death.

08:41.172 --> 08:43.275
Toni was talking to
her sister on Facetime-

08:43.310 --> 08:44.758
Tuesday at 6:00 P.M.

08:45.620 --> 08:47.482
The shipment to
Jamaica left the shop-

08:47.517 --> 08:49.172
00 A.M. Wednesday morning.

08:49.206 --> 08:50.655
Okay so we can
presume she was killed-

08:50.689 --> 08:51.827
within that
12-hour window.

08:51.862 --> 08:54.310
Jesse, let's see if we can
get eyes on Kadi's car.

08:54.344 --> 08:56.103
Toni said that she was
heading to the airport-

08:56.137 --> 08:56.896
after their call.

08:56.931 --> 08:57.758
On it.

08:58.241 --> 08:59.068
You mind if I- ?

08:59.103 --> 08:59.931
Yeah.

09:02.137 --> 09:03.000
Yeah.

09:03.034 --> 09:04.689
This was definitely
somebody she knew.

09:04.724 --> 09:05.620
Someone with access-

09:05.655 --> 09:06.344
to the shop.

09:06.379 --> 09:07.862
Yeah, and a
reason to do it.

09:07.896 --> 09:10.965
Look at how it's carefully
separated from the fish below.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.482
The salt's packed
tightly around it.

09:14.517 --> 09:15.517
Whoever did this-

09:15.551 --> 09:18.275
they didn't want it to
shift during transport.

09:18.310 --> 09:20.931
They wanted the person
opening it to find it just so.

09:20.965 --> 09:21.586
Exactly.

09:21.620 --> 09:22.413
Like a message.

09:22.448 --> 09:24.620
Yeah, like a
horse head in a bed.

09:27.758 --> 09:29.172
Toni was supposed to
pick up the shipment.

09:29.620 --> 09:30.344
Wait.

09:31.310 --> 09:33.758
If someone wanted
to send her a message-

09:33.793 --> 09:35.620
and they find out
that she's here-

09:35.655 --> 09:38.241
She might
be in danger.

09:38.275 --> 09:41.551
You know, my daughter gave me
some of your saltfish as a gift.

09:41.862 --> 09:42.862
I have to say-

09:42.896 --> 09:44.275
It's some of the best
I've had on this island.

09:44.965 --> 09:46.000
And that's saying something.

09:48.551 --> 09:51.448
Kadi would have loved
to hear you say that.

09:52.689 --> 09:55.103
What made her decide
to come to Newfoundland?

09:55.137 --> 09:56.931
She won a
business scholarship-

09:56.965 --> 09:58.241
to Heritage University.

09:59.724 --> 10:00.965
One year here-

10:01.862 --> 10:03.241
she knew she
wanted to start-

10:03.275 --> 10:06.344
a Canada -Jamaica
import-export company.

10:07.413 --> 10:10.655
So she came up with the idea for
Honest to Cod while in school?

10:10.689 --> 10:12.758
Her business
plan was so good.

10:12.793 --> 10:14.793
She got a
start-up loan.

10:16.344 --> 10:18.931
She talked me into
running things back home.

10:21.034 --> 10:21.758
Come in.

10:22.931 --> 10:24.551
Did you find
anything Charlie?

10:24.586 --> 10:26.137
Um, yes.

10:26.172 --> 10:27.000
Uh- Ms. London.

10:27.034 --> 10:28.310
Can you think
of anybody-

10:28.344 --> 10:31.068
who might hold a grudge against
both your sister and yourself?

10:31.586 --> 10:32.586
Me?

10:32.620 --> 10:33.655
Well, the crate
was addressed to you.

10:33.689 --> 10:35.827
And if it wasn't for
the dog at customs-

10:35.862 --> 10:38.310
I would have
opened it myself.

10:38.413 --> 10:39.517
Uh-huh.

10:41.517 --> 10:42.931
Evan Barrett.

10:42.965 --> 10:44.517
Kadi's ex.

10:44.551 --> 10:45.206
Barrett.

10:45.241 --> 10:45.931
Her husband?

10:45.965 --> 10:47.862
Kadi was
divorcing him.

10:47.896 --> 10:48.862
And he thought-

10:48.896 --> 10:50.310
I talked
her into it.

10:50.344 --> 10:52.103
Not that she
needed convincing.

10:52.827 --> 10:55.241
His drinking was more
important to him than his wife.

10:55.275 --> 10:56.172
Okay.

10:56.206 --> 10:57.413
We'll have a
word with him.

10:57.448 --> 11:00.448
In the meantime, in
the interests of your safety.

11:00.482 --> 11:03.827
We'd like you to stay here until
we have Mr. Barrett in custody.

11:03.862 --> 11:06.068
You think that
is necessary?

11:07.137 --> 11:08.379
We can't
be too safe.

11:19.344 --> 11:20.241
Come on pal.

11:23.379 --> 11:24.310
Evan Barrett.

11:26.724 --> 11:27.758
Detective Hudson.

11:27.793 --> 11:29.551
St. John's Police Department.

11:29.586 --> 11:30.275
This is-

11:30.310 --> 11:32.344
my partner, Rex.

11:32.931 --> 11:33.965
How can I
help you?

11:34.000 --> 11:34.655
Well-

11:34.689 --> 11:35.758
we have a report-

11:35.793 --> 11:38.000
of a missing vehicle
belonging to your wife Kadi.

11:38.034 --> 11:40.034
I was wondering if you
might be able to help us out?

11:40.965 --> 11:41.586
Kadi's car?

11:41.620 --> 11:42.551
No, I've
not seen it.

11:46.896 --> 11:48.482
When was the last
time you saw Kadi?

11:49.689 --> 11:51.000
We're not together anymore.

11:51.034 --> 11:52.931
Did I say something
to upset you?

11:52.965 --> 11:54.172
Look, I don't know
about her car.

11:54.206 --> 11:55.758
And I've got nothing
else to say to you.

12:10.413 --> 12:11.413
Hey.

12:11.448 --> 12:13.310
You think you can meet
me down at the docks?

12:13.344 --> 12:14.344
And bring your kit?

12:15.172 --> 12:15.827
Okay.

12:17.172 --> 12:18.275
What's going on?

12:19.068 --> 12:20.620
My partner just found
blood in your truck.

12:29.620 --> 12:31.344
We've the matched
DNA from the hand-

12:31.379 --> 12:32.517
as a sibling of
Toni London's.

12:32.551 --> 12:34.482
So I can confirm
that it belongs to Kadi.

12:34.517 --> 12:36.034
And the blood Rex
found in Evan's truck-

12:36.068 --> 12:37.103
is also a
match to Kadi.

12:37.137 --> 12:38.689
Any blood anywhere
else in the vehicle?

12:38.724 --> 12:40.724
No, and not on
his boat either.

12:40.758 --> 12:42.034
Well.

12:42.068 --> 12:43.551
He had a few incidents of drunk
and disorderly on his record.

12:43.586 --> 12:45.068
Seems like a guy
with a temper.

12:45.103 --> 12:46.206
Well you
said it earlier.

12:46.241 --> 12:48.206
It's possible that he
did it somewhere else-

12:48.241 --> 12:50.206
and only moved the
hand in his truck.

12:50.241 --> 12:52.068
Actually, that might account for
the limited amount of blood.

12:52.103 --> 12:53.551
Her ex.

12:53.586 --> 12:54.448
He'd have
the key code.

12:54.482 --> 12:56.275
A supplier for
Honest to Cod-

12:56.310 --> 12:57.137
he'd know the
shipping routine.

12:58.172 --> 13:00.103
Let's see what he has
to say for himself huh?

13:04.206 --> 13:05.448
What the
hell is going on?

13:06.379 --> 13:08.586
What does blood in my truck have
to do with Kadi's stolen car?

13:08.620 --> 13:10.241
I didn't steal
her damn car.

13:12.068 --> 13:14.103
We didn't even argue
over it in the divorce.

13:14.137 --> 13:15.448
What did you
argue over?

13:16.862 --> 13:18.206
I didn't carry anything
out of our house-

13:18.241 --> 13:19.689
that I didn't
bring into it, okay?

13:19.724 --> 13:21.137
But you didn't
want the divorce.

13:21.172 --> 13:22.137
Who wants to
get divorced?

13:22.172 --> 13:22.793
Would you?

13:24.206 --> 13:24.965
No.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.482
And I think it would
make me mad.

13:27.517 --> 13:28.655
Mad at Kadi.

13:28.689 --> 13:29.931
Mad at her sister
too maybe.

13:29.965 --> 13:30.793
Her sister?

13:30.827 --> 13:31.793
Yeah.

13:31.827 --> 13:34.620
Didn't she encourage
Kadi to kick you out?

13:34.655 --> 13:36.482
What has Toni got to
do with any of this?

13:36.517 --> 13:37.758
You were mad
about the divorce.

13:37.793 --> 13:38.827
What did you
do about it?

13:38.862 --> 13:39.551
Nothing.

13:40.379 --> 13:42.379
How am I going
to blame Kadi?

13:42.413 --> 13:43.413
She gave me
plenty of chances.

13:43.448 --> 13:45.379
It's my own
fault I couldn't-

13:47.482 --> 13:48.793
get my act together.

13:49.137 --> 13:50.758
How did Kadi's blood
get in your truck?

13:50.793 --> 13:52.965
What is Kadi
telling you?

13:55.517 --> 13:56.758
It's from months ago.

13:57.517 --> 13:59.310
We went
on a hike.

13:59.344 --> 14:01.379
She fell and
she cut herself.

14:01.965 --> 14:03.310
I carried her back to the truck.

14:06.448 --> 14:07.448
What's this about?

14:09.482 --> 14:10.620
Kadi's car is missing.

14:10.655 --> 14:13.448
And we haven't been
able to reach her.

14:17.068 --> 14:19.724
Well she's on that
retreat in Costa Rica.

14:21.172 --> 14:23.551
We have reason to believe
that's not the case.

14:26.620 --> 14:27.655
What reason?

14:29.655 --> 14:32.034
Has your ex-wife been
having problems with anyone?

14:32.068 --> 14:34.827
Anyone who might
want to harm her?

14:37.517 --> 14:38.344
Detective, please.

14:38.379 --> 14:39.172
Just-

14:40.724 --> 14:42.310
tell me what's
happened to her.

14:47.827 --> 14:49.344
He said he thought
she was on her vacation.

14:49.379 --> 14:50.068
And I believe him.

14:50.103 --> 14:51.172
Okay, where does
that leave us?

14:51.206 --> 14:52.206
Well Evan said-

14:52.241 --> 14:53.896
that Kadi had been
receiving threatening calls-

14:53.931 --> 14:54.965
from an unknown number.

14:55.000 --> 14:55.931
Racial slurs.

14:55.965 --> 14:57.517
Warnings to leave town.

14:57.551 --> 14:58.551
Scared her enough-

14:58.586 --> 14:59.931
that she let him sleep
on her couch one night.

14:59.965 --> 15:01.551
He have any idea
what it was about?

15:01.586 --> 15:02.448
No, neither
of them knew.

15:02.482 --> 15:03.862
She wasn't dating
anyone new.

15:03.896 --> 15:05.586
No arguments with anyone.

15:05.620 --> 15:06.862
There had been a
couple of incidents-

15:06.896 --> 15:08.241
of vandalism
at the shop.

15:08.275 --> 15:08.896
Guys?

15:08.931 --> 15:09.551
Yeah.

15:09.586 --> 15:10.241
Here.

15:11.034 --> 15:12.551
I've got something
right here.

15:12.586 --> 15:13.793
Last ping
from Kadi's cell-

15:13.827 --> 15:14.551
was at the airport.

15:14.586 --> 15:15.586
And take a
look at this.

15:16.172 --> 15:17.103
In the
self-park lot.

15:17.137 --> 15:18.620
That's Kadi's car.

15:22.896 --> 15:23.724
But
that's not Kadi.

15:23.758 --> 15:24.379
Or Evan.

15:24.413 --> 15:26.034
Good job, Jesse.

15:26.448 --> 15:27.620
Kadi's body
may be in her car.

15:27.655 --> 15:28.310
Rex!

15:28.344 --> 15:29.379
Come on, pal.

15:34.344 --> 15:35.000
Mr. Barrett.

15:35.034 --> 15:36.482
We appreciate your cooperation.

15:36.517 --> 15:38.310
And you'll call me when
you hear anything new?

15:40.275 --> 15:41.137
Toni's here?

15:42.000 --> 15:43.517
Look, I don't think
this is a good time-

15:43.551 --> 15:45.241
Toni.

15:45.275 --> 15:46.551
Look.

15:47.689 --> 15:48.862
I don't even
know what to say.

15:48.896 --> 15:50.034
You're releasing him?

15:50.068 --> 15:51.206
I had nothing-

15:51.241 --> 15:51.896
to do with this.

15:51.931 --> 15:52.862
You've got
to believe me.

15:53.310 --> 15:55.206
I don't know what
to believe, Evan.

15:55.793 --> 15:57.931
Look, Mr. Barrett is not
a suspect at this time.

15:57.965 --> 15:59.034
At this time?

15:59.068 --> 16:00.241
I told you how
he treated her.

16:00.275 --> 16:01.310
No no,
Kadi and I-

16:01.344 --> 16:02.137
we were-

16:03.517 --> 16:04.793
working through things.

16:04.827 --> 16:07.379
To be civil,
you know?

16:07.413 --> 16:09.827
Maybe one day,
even friends.

16:12.689 --> 16:13.793
I'm your main
fish supplier.

16:13.827 --> 16:15.689
Would she have kept me on
if things were that bad?

16:15.793 --> 16:18.344
She renewed
your contract?

16:19.000 --> 16:20.551
She didn't
tell me that.

16:20.586 --> 16:22.482
She thought that
you would judge her.

16:22.517 --> 16:24.448
Think that she
was a pushover.

16:25.827 --> 16:27.965
I only wanted what
was best for her.

16:28.068 --> 16:28.827
I know.

16:31.000 --> 16:31.758
I know.

16:32.655 --> 16:34.275
But I would never
lay a hand on her-

16:34.310 --> 16:35.275
Much less-

16:39.758 --> 16:41.448
I'm sorry for
your loss, Toni.

16:46.758 --> 16:49.172
Mr. Barrett gave us some
really good information.

16:49.206 --> 16:51.620
Your sister was
receiving threats.

16:52.482 --> 16:54.965
She never told me
about any threats.

17:06.482 --> 17:07.965
Nothing in Kadi's car
except for her luggage.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.724
But Rex did
find this.

17:09.758 --> 17:11.724
Okay, I'm just on the line
with Kadi's service provider.

17:11.758 --> 17:13.103
With the dates and
times of the calls-

17:13.137 --> 17:14.655
we should be able to
track the blocked ID.

17:14.689 --> 17:15.724
So you were saying-

17:15.758 --> 17:17.137
that the phone calls
started about a month ago.

17:17.172 --> 17:18.241
Yeah, started
once in a while.

17:18.275 --> 17:20.068
But then she's been getting
them a few times a week.

17:20.103 --> 17:20.724
Hey, hey.

17:20.758 --> 17:21.827
Yeah yeah,
I'm still here.

17:22.655 --> 17:23.310
Oh great.

17:23.344 --> 17:24.482
You're a
rock star, Lou.

17:24.517 --> 17:25.172
Thank you.

17:26.103 --> 17:27.137
Okay, looks like
the blocked ID-

17:27.172 --> 17:29.620
belonged to someone
called Archibald Parsons.

17:29.655 --> 17:30.655
Sorry, Archie Parsons?

17:30.758 --> 17:32.172
Why do I know
that name?

17:32.206 --> 17:34.551
He donates to the police
memorial fund every year.

17:34.586 --> 17:36.068
What's his
connection to Kadi?

17:36.103 --> 17:37.586
Well his family
is in saltfish.

17:37.620 --> 17:38.793
Has been for generations.

17:38.827 --> 17:41.758
The Parsons plant employs
over a hundred people.

17:41.793 --> 17:44.137
You think he has a problem
with Honest to Cod?

17:44.862 --> 17:45.655
I'll call him in.

17:45.689 --> 17:47.241
I'll sit in with
you Charlie, but-

17:47.275 --> 17:49.000
we have to tread
lightly on this one.

17:49.034 --> 17:50.896
Friends in high
places and such.

18:01.275 --> 18:01.965
Hmm!

18:03.241 --> 18:04.000
Here you go, bud.

18:05.172 --> 18:05.931
That's weird.

18:10.413 --> 18:11.620
Where you going, buddy?

18:33.379 --> 18:35.413
And what
can I do for you?

18:36.482 --> 18:37.310
Okay okay.

18:42.551 --> 18:43.344
Ah-ha-hah!

18:43.379 --> 18:44.034
I got you!

18:45.137 --> 18:45.965
Uh-

18:46.000 --> 18:47.310
am I not supposed
to be feeding him?

18:50.793 --> 18:52.172
Is that-?

18:52.206 --> 18:53.344
Is that gourmet jerky?

18:53.379 --> 18:54.827
Am I in trouble?

18:54.862 --> 18:55.862
Well yeah!

18:55.896 --> 18:57.172
You're going to spend
half your pay cheque-

18:57.206 --> 18:58.344
if you keep
giving him that.

18:58.379 --> 19:01.482
Uh- I thought if I want to
make friends with the team-

19:01.517 --> 19:02.655
then I should
start with Rex.

19:02.689 --> 19:03.620
Yeah, you're
not wrong.

19:03.655 --> 19:05.241
And look, it is
okay to feed Rex.

19:05.275 --> 19:06.551
Even if Rex doesn't-

19:06.586 --> 19:08.000
go for my
treats anymore.

19:09.172 --> 19:11.551
Did you follow
him here?

19:13.310 --> 19:13.965
I'm Jesse.

19:15.517 --> 19:16.172
Karma.

19:16.206 --> 19:16.862
Hi.

19:17.620 --> 19:19.137
Okay okay.

19:19.586 --> 19:20.689
Here you go.

19:20.793 --> 19:21.517
Call me Archie.

19:21.551 --> 19:23.172
I'm very happy
to be of help.

19:23.206 --> 19:24.275
Great.

19:24.310 --> 19:25.344
You made several
phone calls-

19:25.379 --> 19:26.413
to Kadi Barrett.

19:26.448 --> 19:27.827
What was the subject
of those phone calls?

19:28.931 --> 19:30.137
Ms. Barrett
is a colleague.

19:30.344 --> 19:31.068
Colleague?

19:31.103 --> 19:31.862
Yeah.

19:31.896 --> 19:32.620
Or competitor?

19:34.068 --> 19:34.689
Detective.

19:34.724 --> 19:35.344
Competitor?

19:35.379 --> 19:36.482
I mean-

19:36.517 --> 19:40.206
a bear doesn't look at
a toy poodle as competition.

19:40.241 --> 19:42.551
Yeah, a bear doesn't make calls
in the middle of the night.

19:42.655 --> 19:45.034
Ms. Barrett and I
talked about business.

19:45.068 --> 19:47.827
I'm happy to mentor
young entrepreneurs.

19:47.862 --> 19:48.517
Hmm.

19:48.551 --> 19:49.862
Well-

19:49.896 --> 19:52.310
all the phone calls were
from your phone to hers.

19:52.344 --> 19:53.275
And her husband
said that-

19:53.310 --> 19:54.724
she mentioned she
was being threatened.

19:54.827 --> 19:57.793
I can't explain what
she told her husband.

19:57.827 --> 19:58.862
Maybe you should
ask her yourself.

19:58.896 --> 20:01.103
Well we can't ask
her ourselves-

20:01.137 --> 20:01.827
because she's been murdered.

20:03.206 --> 20:03.931
What?

20:05.034 --> 20:06.827
That's awful!

20:06.862 --> 20:08.482
Where were you
three nights ago?

20:10.517 --> 20:11.517
Superintendent.

20:11.551 --> 20:12.896
You said this was going
to be a friendly chat.

20:12.931 --> 20:15.103
This is just merely
a formality, Archie.

20:15.137 --> 20:16.793
We just need to eliminate
you from all the inquiries.

20:16.827 --> 20:17.448
That's all.

20:17.482 --> 20:18.551
Well-

20:19.655 --> 20:20.482
three nights ago-

20:20.517 --> 20:22.689
I was at my cottage
with the wife.

20:22.724 --> 20:24.482
Feel free
to ask her.

20:24.517 --> 20:26.724
Now I am truly sorry
about Ms. Barrett.

20:26.758 --> 20:29.379
But anything else I have
to say on this matter-

20:29.413 --> 20:30.896
I will say
to the Chief.

20:31.965 --> 20:32.793
Gentlemen.

20:37.310 --> 20:38.724
Tread lightly, I said.

20:38.758 --> 20:39.724
Hey, Joe.

20:39.758 --> 20:41.344
We have him dead to
rights on the calls.

20:41.379 --> 20:43.413
There's no way to know
what was said though Charlie.

20:43.448 --> 20:45.000
All we have is the word
of the ex-husband.

20:45.034 --> 20:48.068
You think they were
sharing saltfish recipes?

20:48.103 --> 20:49.413
Archie Parsons
runs a huge operation.

20:49.448 --> 20:50.172
I just-

20:50.896 --> 20:52.344
I can't see a
motive here.

20:54.206 --> 20:56.620
That man
killed my sister!

21:06.965 --> 21:08.448
What
exactly did he say?

21:08.482 --> 21:09.724
He offered his condolences.

21:09.758 --> 21:10.965
And then he
said to call him-

21:11.000 --> 21:12.965
if I need help
closing down our shop.

21:13.068 --> 21:15.344
He offered
you his help?

21:15.379 --> 21:16.379
Hmm.

21:16.413 --> 21:17.310
Yes.

21:17.344 --> 21:18.379
Then he
shook my hand.

21:18.413 --> 21:20.413
And he said I had
elegant fingers!

21:20.448 --> 21:22.137
You see?

21:22.172 --> 21:24.275
He was talking
about Kadi's hand.

21:24.310 --> 21:25.448
The message.

21:25.482 --> 21:28.620
If you could see the look in
his eyes when he said it!

21:28.655 --> 21:30.000
That was a threat!

21:32.275 --> 21:35.103
Do you know why Archie Parsons
would have a problem with Kadi?

21:35.137 --> 21:38.275
We just secured a big
hotel contract in Jamaica.

21:38.310 --> 21:39.758
Parsons used to
supply the chain.

21:39.793 --> 21:40.758
Okay.

21:41.620 --> 21:42.965
We'll have a
look into that.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.206
Why, you don't
believe me?

21:44.241 --> 21:45.620
No, no.

21:45.655 --> 21:46.482
That's not
what we said.

21:46.517 --> 21:47.206
It's just that-

21:47.241 --> 21:48.275
a handshake's not enough.

21:48.310 --> 21:48.931
We need evidence.

21:48.965 --> 21:49.931
That takes time.

21:49.965 --> 21:50.586
No!

21:50.620 --> 21:51.620
You know what?

21:51.655 --> 21:52.413
I done!

21:55.827 --> 21:56.896
Mm-hmm.

21:58.793 --> 21:59.620
Ms. London.

22:00.758 --> 22:01.620
Listen Joe.

22:01.655 --> 22:03.103
You may be
a good guy.

22:03.137 --> 22:04.310
But me come
from a place-

22:04.344 --> 22:06.758
where rich men like Archie
Parsons can slip a cop a C-note.

22:06.793 --> 22:08.275
And he get off,
scott free.

22:08.310 --> 22:09.827
Charlie Hudson
is not like that.

22:09.862 --> 22:11.586
With all due respect-

22:11.620 --> 22:13.586
you can find corruption
upon any force.

22:14.793 --> 22:16.724
All I can say is that
if it were my sister-

22:17.517 --> 22:19.448
Charlie's the first person
I'd want on the case.

22:19.482 --> 22:22.034
You really think he will
do all that is necessary-

22:22.068 --> 22:23.275
to bring Kadi justice?

22:23.379 --> 22:25.000
If anyone's going to
get to the bottom of this-

22:25.034 --> 22:26.620
it is my team.

22:26.655 --> 22:27.517
You have my word.

22:28.517 --> 22:29.172
Now listen.

22:29.206 --> 22:31.379
You have
had a long-

22:31.413 --> 22:32.896
and difficult day.

22:32.931 --> 22:34.448
I have an officer here
who is standing by-

22:34.482 --> 22:37.206
to take you
your hotel.

22:37.241 --> 22:39.758
I'm counting on you, Superintendent.

22:39.793 --> 22:41.034
That's why I'm here.

22:41.965 --> 22:43.034
Now go on.

22:43.068 --> 22:44.344
Get some rest.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.379
Okay, thanks
for your time.

22:56.206 --> 22:58.517
The General Manager of
the Ocean Shine hotel chain-

22:58.551 --> 23:01.275
did confirm that she recently
awarded her fish contract-

23:01.310 --> 23:02.379
to Honest To Cod.

23:02.413 --> 23:04.448
Did she say how
Parsons took it?

23:04.482 --> 23:05.551
Said he was professional.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.137
Well what do
you think?

23:07.172 --> 23:08.862
Do you think Toni was right
and he's involved somehow?

23:08.896 --> 23:09.965
I don't know.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.586
Something doesn't feel right.

23:11.620 --> 23:13.896
I wish we had
confirmation-

23:13.931 --> 23:15.517
of the harrassment
in Kadi's emails.

23:15.551 --> 23:17.000
Well I searched every
possible keyword-

23:17.034 --> 23:19.275
in your basic
harasser's dictionary.

23:19.310 --> 23:20.758
A couple of
new ones too.

23:21.310 --> 23:22.310
Nothing popped up.

23:22.344 --> 23:24.586
Well I did
find a thread-

23:24.620 --> 23:27.793
between her and
her accountant.

23:27.827 --> 23:30.344
It starts out generic
enough but gets heated.

23:30.379 --> 23:32.275
Toni mentioned hiring
a new accountant.

23:32.689 --> 23:33.344
Ah here!

23:33.379 --> 23:34.448
Yeah, look!

23:34.482 --> 23:36.344
Kadi fired this
guy last week.

23:37.241 --> 23:39.379
She asked him to return all
their books before her trip.

23:39.413 --> 23:40.172
What's his name?

23:40.965 --> 23:41.689
Craig Fields?

23:41.724 --> 23:42.655
Craig- ?

23:42.689 --> 23:43.586
Okay, guys.

23:43.620 --> 23:45.413
Look at this.

23:45.448 --> 23:46.344
Location tracking
from Kadi's cell.

23:46.448 --> 23:48.448
Between Honest to Cod
and the airport-

23:48.482 --> 23:50.482
she made a 25 minute
stop at an address-

23:50.517 --> 23:51.827
belonging to-

23:51.862 --> 23:52.793
Craig Fields.

23:52.896 --> 23:53.896
Craig Fields.

23:53.931 --> 23:55.103
I said it first.

23:59.103 --> 23:59.724
Hey!

24:01.344 --> 24:02.000
You okay?

24:02.034 --> 24:03.448
Uh-

24:05.862 --> 24:08.103
Some of my victim's
personal items are missing.

24:08.137 --> 24:10.448
Like the ring
from the hand.

24:10.482 --> 24:12.724
And now, a watch
from another body.

24:12.827 --> 24:14.586
Oh!

24:14.620 --> 24:17.310
Well I mean, there's got
to be a logical explanation.

24:17.344 --> 24:19.206
I've looked everywhere!

24:19.241 --> 24:21.137
Has anything like this
ever happened here before?

24:22.586 --> 24:23.275
I don't think so.

24:25.758 --> 24:27.103
What if somebody
thinks that I stole them?

24:27.137 --> 24:28.793
Oh nobody's going
to think that.

24:28.827 --> 24:30.137
Well, I'm new here.

24:30.172 --> 24:31.793
That's what I
would think!

24:32.724 --> 24:33.379
Yeah.

24:34.379 --> 24:35.586
Maybe you just need
a second set of eyes.

24:35.620 --> 24:36.310
Yeah?

24:36.344 --> 24:37.241
Okay, yeah.
- Come on!

24:39.000 --> 24:42.275
So you were here alone
for the whole night?

24:42.310 --> 24:43.448
Three nights
ago, you say?

24:43.482 --> 24:44.206
Mm-hmm.

24:44.241 --> 24:46.413
Uh yeah, yeah!

24:46.448 --> 24:47.586
All alone!

24:47.620 --> 24:49.620
Just me and my shows
and my bag of popcorn.

24:50.551 --> 24:51.379
Hmm.

24:52.344 --> 24:53.793
How long did you work
for Kadi Barrett?

24:54.448 --> 24:56.379
Oh uh-

24:56.413 --> 24:57.068
Let me think now.

24:57.103 --> 24:57.758
Um-

24:58.241 --> 24:58.896
A year?

24:58.931 --> 25:00.965
A year and
a half maybe?

25:01.000 --> 25:01.620
Lovely woman.

25:01.655 --> 25:02.310
Great.

25:02.344 --> 25:03.862
We worked great together.

25:04.551 --> 25:05.275
And you know what?

25:05.310 --> 25:05.931
Here's the thing.

25:05.965 --> 25:07.724
I've balanced the books-

25:07.758 --> 25:08.965
for a lot of
little businesses-

25:09.000 --> 25:10.172
over the years.

25:10.206 --> 25:12.724
And some people think
it's all numbers.

25:12.758 --> 25:15.137
But it really brightens up the
work when it's for someone-

25:15.172 --> 25:16.137
as passionate
about her product-

25:16.172 --> 25:17.275
as Kadi.

25:18.206 --> 25:19.482
Great business sense too!

25:19.517 --> 25:20.724
Look.

25:20.758 --> 25:22.413
It made my job a
heck of a lot easier.

25:22.448 --> 25:23.482
Let me tell you.

25:24.793 --> 25:26.724
Any idea why she
fired you last week?

25:27.793 --> 25:28.551
Uh.

25:29.517 --> 25:30.896
Where's your dog going?

25:30.931 --> 25:31.551
I'm not-

25:31.586 --> 25:32.413
picking up after him.

25:32.448 --> 25:33.655
He can't just go out
there, you know?

25:33.689 --> 25:35.103
He's just
doing his job.

25:35.137 --> 25:37.413
Why did Kadi Barrett
fire you last week?

25:37.448 --> 25:40.689
Oh I wouldn't say
that she fired me.

25:40.724 --> 25:41.862
It was more of a
misunderstanding!

25:41.896 --> 25:43.482
About the numbers!

25:43.517 --> 25:44.896
You know how bad
women are with numbers!

25:45.793 --> 25:46.862
Not in my experience.

25:46.896 --> 25:47.862
Right, right.

25:47.896 --> 25:48.517
Just kidding.

25:48.551 --> 25:49.241
Not funny.

25:54.517 --> 25:56.758
But it was a misunderstanding.

25:56.793 --> 25:58.620
We were going to talk
about it after she got back.

25:58.655 --> 26:00.793
Were going to-?

26:00.827 --> 26:04.517
Is there a reason why you can't
talk to her when she gets back?

26:04.551 --> 26:06.413
Well if she-

26:06.448 --> 26:07.103
Well I-

26:07.137 --> 26:09.241
Look, anyway-

26:09.275 --> 26:11.724
Honest to Cod is
just one contract.

26:11.758 --> 26:13.241
I've got loads
of other clients!

26:13.275 --> 26:14.103
No hard feelings!

26:14.137 --> 26:14.793
You know?

26:23.448 --> 26:25.241
What's your dog's name?

26:26.655 --> 26:27.413
Rex.

26:27.448 --> 26:29.448
Rex!

26:44.206 --> 26:44.862
What is it?

26:53.000 --> 26:53.655
Hey.

26:54.931 --> 26:56.482
We're going to need a forensic
team down here immediately.

27:00.827 --> 27:03.275
Good job, partner.

27:04.241 --> 27:05.827
And you're sure you
removed all the items?

27:06.448 --> 27:07.310
Definitely.

27:07.655 --> 27:09.586
Sarah even commented
on Kadi's ring.

27:17.310 --> 27:19.137
And as for
the watch-

27:21.103 --> 27:21.896
Look!

27:21.931 --> 27:22.620
See?

27:22.655 --> 27:23.344
It's gone!

27:23.379 --> 27:24.793
Yeah, it is.

27:24.827 --> 27:26.689
Um- I think we should
look somewhere else though.

27:28.068 --> 27:29.724
Oh my Goddess.

27:29.827 --> 27:30.413
Ugh.

27:36.068 --> 27:36.689
Jesse.

27:36.724 --> 27:37.655
I'm so sorry.

27:37.689 --> 27:39.206
I thought you were
used to cadavers by now.

27:39.241 --> 27:40.448
I usually deal
with more of the-

27:40.724 --> 27:42.827
computer-based
side of the murders.

27:42.862 --> 27:44.413
Right, yeah.

27:44.448 --> 27:45.655
I forget that-

27:45.689 --> 27:47.034
not everybody
is weird like me.

27:47.068 --> 27:49.172
Oh I didn't say
I wasn't weird.

27:51.206 --> 27:52.689
Did you draw these?

27:52.724 --> 27:53.344
Yeah.

27:53.379 --> 27:54.034
Cool!

27:54.068 --> 27:55.344
These are really good!

27:55.379 --> 27:56.827
Thanks!

27:56.862 --> 27:58.137
And thanks for
your help too-

27:58.172 --> 27:58.793
by the way.

27:58.827 --> 27:59.482
Oh.

27:59.517 --> 28:00.448
I really don't think-

28:00.482 --> 28:01.827
we're going to find
these personal effects.

28:01.862 --> 28:03.379
I think someone
must have stolen them.

28:03.413 --> 28:04.103
You know-

28:04.137 --> 28:05.172
I find it hard
to believe-

28:05.206 --> 28:07.137
that someone working here
would steal something.

28:07.172 --> 28:08.827
But-

28:08.862 --> 28:11.241
you know-
just in case-

28:12.137 --> 28:13.241
let me see
your earrings.

28:18.103 --> 28:19.793
Where do you keep
the personal belongings?

28:19.827 --> 28:20.482
Uh-

28:21.827 --> 28:22.586
Okay.

28:23.689 --> 28:25.241
What are
you up to?

28:25.275 --> 28:26.586
Ye ole classic
bait and wait.

28:32.482 --> 28:33.448
Hey Sarah.

28:33.482 --> 28:34.896
Your team just finished
sweeping Craig's place.

28:34.931 --> 28:36.793
Somebody wiped the
floor with bleach.

28:36.827 --> 28:38.689
But Rex's nose
didn't betray him.

28:38.724 --> 28:40.000
Detective.

28:41.034 --> 28:42.137
Yeah, I've
got to go.

28:43.206 --> 28:43.896
Yeah.

28:57.931 --> 28:58.862
Kadi Barrett.

29:03.862 --> 29:06.379
The victim's carotid artery
was severed with a sharp blade.

29:06.413 --> 29:08.172
Possibly the same blade
that severed her hand.

29:08.206 --> 29:09.896
She would
have died very quickly.

29:10.689 --> 29:11.517
Within minutes.

29:11.551 --> 29:12.862
Leaving behind
a lot of blood.

29:12.896 --> 29:15.172
Yeah, it fits with what we
found at Craig Fields' house.

29:15.206 --> 29:17.034
I'd like you to
release Kadi's ring-

29:17.068 --> 29:18.827
now that we've
discovered her remains.

29:18.862 --> 29:20.275
I want her sister
to have it.

29:20.310 --> 29:22.068
Don't we
need that for the trial?

29:22.103 --> 29:24.000
I'm going to
make an exception.

29:24.034 --> 29:24.689
Right.

29:24.793 --> 29:25.482
Of course.

29:25.517 --> 29:26.517
I'll bring that
up to you-

29:26.551 --> 29:28.068
as soon as I've
cleaned up down here.

29:28.931 --> 29:30.034
Thank you.

29:36.724 --> 29:38.241
I'm being framed.

29:38.275 --> 29:39.137
I swear!

29:39.172 --> 29:41.379
Anyone could have
gotten into my yard!

29:41.413 --> 29:42.689
Put her there.

29:42.724 --> 29:43.655
Little would I know!

29:43.689 --> 29:45.620
But we found blood
in your house, Craig.

29:45.655 --> 29:47.275
Maybe they did it
while I was out!

29:47.310 --> 29:48.241
And cleaned up!

29:48.275 --> 29:51.206
Location tracking
on Kadi's phone-

29:51.241 --> 29:52.344
said she arrived
at your house-

29:52.379 --> 29:53.724
at 6:15.

29:53.758 --> 29:55.344
You said you were at
your house all night.

29:56.206 --> 29:57.103
Right.

29:57.344 --> 29:58.172
Okay.

29:58.206 --> 29:58.965
Okay, right.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.379
Yes, yes.

30:00.413 --> 30:02.344
She did drop off
some documents.

30:02.379 --> 30:04.034
But then she left
to go to the airport!

30:04.068 --> 30:05.448
Well this is you-

30:05.482 --> 30:06.827
dropping her car
off at the airport-

30:06.862 --> 30:07.517
just before 7:00.

30:13.413 --> 30:16.034
We found Kadi with
her jacket over her face.

30:16.068 --> 30:18.517
You know what
that tells us Craig?

30:20.137 --> 30:22.689
It tells us that you had
remorse for what you did.

30:24.275 --> 30:25.344
I'm framed!

30:25.379 --> 30:26.896
You're caught!

30:26.931 --> 30:27.862
Blood in your house.

30:27.896 --> 30:29.413
Photo on CCTV.

30:29.448 --> 30:30.551
You even had
the key code-

30:30.586 --> 30:32.689
to get into the shop so
you could plant the hand.

30:34.034 --> 30:35.103
Oh God, the hand!

30:38.724 --> 30:39.655
Yeah.

30:40.034 --> 30:41.758
And why'd you
do that, Craig?

30:48.793 --> 30:49.655
Okay.

30:49.689 --> 30:50.655
It looks like
Boris isn't our thief.

30:50.689 --> 30:51.344
That's a relief.

30:52.862 --> 30:54.862
Well I'm glad
for Boris-

30:55.448 --> 30:56.517
and his honest heart.

30:57.965 --> 30:59.310
But he was
my last hope.

31:03.517 --> 31:04.896
I've been a fill-in
pathologist-

31:04.931 --> 31:06.137
all over this province.

31:06.827 --> 31:07.482
I don't know-

31:07.517 --> 31:08.379
what it is
about me!

31:08.413 --> 31:10.517
No one took
me seriously.

31:11.758 --> 31:13.068
Not until Dr. Truong.

31:14.551 --> 31:16.793
Yeah, it must be hard to
always be the new kid huh?

31:16.827 --> 31:18.275
I want to work
in one place.

31:19.379 --> 31:20.586
A place where I-

31:22.137 --> 31:23.034
fit in.

31:24.482 --> 31:25.827
I mean if it's
any consolation-

31:25.862 --> 31:27.241
I didn't fit in
here for like-

31:28.275 --> 31:29.655
the first three years.

31:30.620 --> 31:31.482
So-

31:32.655 --> 31:33.965
you know what
it's like, then.

31:34.000 --> 31:35.862
Yeah I do.

31:35.896 --> 31:36.689
But you know what?

31:37.586 --> 31:38.965
I mean, I found
my footing.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.655
And you will too.

31:40.689 --> 31:41.482
Definitely.

31:42.655 --> 31:44.413
Should we try
again tomorrow?

31:45.103 --> 31:45.896
Sure.

31:45.931 --> 31:46.758
Good.

31:46.793 --> 31:47.931
Because my legs
are falling asleep.

31:50.620 --> 31:51.724
Let's see
your report okay?

31:51.758 --> 31:52.482
Thank you very much.

31:52.517 --> 31:53.413
That's good.

31:56.241 --> 31:57.137
You found her?

31:57.172 --> 31:59.068
And we have a
culprit in custody.

32:00.241 --> 32:01.482
It was Archie.

32:01.517 --> 32:02.827
It was Craig Fields.

32:02.862 --> 32:03.689
The accountant.

32:04.689 --> 32:05.344
And we have a really
solid case against him.

32:06.655 --> 32:08.689
You think he killed my sister
over a couple thousand dollars?

32:08.724 --> 32:10.482
Sorry, what are
you talking about?

32:10.517 --> 32:11.965
Craig skimmed
from our tax rebates.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
That's why
Kadi fired him.

32:13.034 --> 32:14.827
Why didn't you
tell us this?

32:14.862 --> 32:17.137
But it was only a
couple of thousand.

32:17.172 --> 32:19.862
She wasn't even sure she
was going to report him.

32:19.896 --> 32:22.620
Does that seem
like a reason to kill?

32:24.448 --> 32:25.379
Actually, it might.

32:25.413 --> 32:26.586
What do you mean?

32:26.620 --> 32:27.586
Well if he
was reported-

32:27.620 --> 32:29.551
that means they would
have had to do an audit-

32:29.586 --> 32:30.827
on all of
his clients.

32:30.862 --> 32:33.689
And HST is both a
Federal and Provincial tax-

32:33.724 --> 32:35.068
which means that he
would have been charged-

32:35.103 --> 32:36.724
with defrauding
both governments.

32:36.758 --> 32:38.655
Lost his accounting license-

32:38.689 --> 32:40.000
and faced
certain jail time.

32:41.241 --> 32:42.793
That sounds like a damn
good motive to me.

32:45.724 --> 32:49.000
Craig Fields was eyeballs-deep
in stealing from Honest to Cod-

32:49.034 --> 32:49.896
and a few
other clients.

32:49.931 --> 32:51.896
I'm checking
for the rest.

32:51.931 --> 32:53.482
Craig Fields's prints
are on Kadi's coat-

32:53.517 --> 32:54.344
and her car.

32:54.379 --> 32:55.655
Her blood was
in his house.

32:55.689 --> 32:57.965
Now, her throat was
cut with the same knife-

32:58.000 --> 32:58.931
used to remove
her hand.

32:58.965 --> 32:59.965
So if we find
that knife-

33:00.000 --> 33:00.896
Yeah but
even without it-

33:00.931 --> 33:02.310
it seems like an
open and shut case.

33:02.344 --> 33:03.379
Yeah.

33:03.413 --> 33:05.068
We certainly have a lot
of evidence against Craig.

33:05.103 --> 33:06.344
I'm sensing a but.

33:08.000 --> 33:09.448
But why send
the hand?

33:09.482 --> 33:11.103
Toni didn't rate
him as a suspect.

33:11.137 --> 33:12.310
What did he
have against her?

33:12.344 --> 33:13.689
What did he say
when you asked him?

33:13.724 --> 33:14.862
He didn't
have an answer.

33:14.896 --> 33:16.689
And that's another
thing about him too.

33:16.724 --> 33:18.068
He's got a
weak stomach.

33:18.103 --> 33:19.586
You think he had
an accomplice?

33:19.620 --> 33:21.103
I think he's
protecting somebody.

33:21.206 --> 33:22.448
Jesse.

33:22.482 --> 33:23.931
Do you have a
list of Craig's clients?

33:23.965 --> 33:25.379
Yeah, sure thing.

33:25.413 --> 33:26.827
Well, he's going to
have to name names.

33:27.689 --> 33:28.344
And then some.

33:34.827 --> 33:35.758
Ughh.

33:35.793 --> 33:37.310
This is not
looking like-

33:37.344 --> 33:39.482
we're going to be able
to get you off here Craig.

33:39.517 --> 33:40.586
The only question
now is-

33:40.620 --> 33:42.551
what is the charge
going to be.

33:42.586 --> 33:43.689
And how much time?

33:45.758 --> 33:47.379
How much do you
think it will be?

33:47.413 --> 33:49.000
First degree murder?

33:50.137 --> 33:51.896
The jury is not going
to like the dismemberment.

33:51.931 --> 33:53.482
I'm guessing
life in prison.

33:53.517 --> 33:57.586
I was not built
for jail, Detective!

34:02.827 --> 34:04.379
Well there is accessory
after the fact.

34:04.413 --> 34:06.620
The judge has a little
leeway with that.

34:06.655 --> 34:07.620
They tend to use
their discretion-

34:07.655 --> 34:08.517
for people who cooperate.

34:08.551 --> 34:09.965
Accessory after the fact!

34:10.000 --> 34:11.517
You know what happened!

34:11.551 --> 34:12.448
You know, I
did notice-

34:12.482 --> 34:14.758
that Archie Parsons
is your client list.

34:14.793 --> 34:16.862
Did you skim
from his taxes, too?

34:16.896 --> 34:18.068
Never mind jail.

34:18.103 --> 34:19.827
I would have to have a death
wish to talk about Archie.

34:19.862 --> 34:20.655
Yeah?

34:21.172 --> 34:23.517
What was Archie's
problem with Kadi?

34:24.689 --> 34:26.379
It was the
hotel contract.

34:26.413 --> 34:27.275
That's what
set him off.

34:28.172 --> 34:29.724
And he had you
set up a meeting?

34:29.758 --> 34:32.620
He told me that if
I could convince her-

34:32.655 --> 34:34.241
to sell Honest
to Cod to him-

34:35.620 --> 34:36.965
then he would
make me the CFO.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.724
I thought
that maybe-

34:39.758 --> 34:41.689
everything would work
out good for everyone.

34:41.724 --> 34:43.000
Kadi, look
there's no reason-

34:43.034 --> 34:44.655
to talk about anybody
firing anybody.

34:44.689 --> 34:45.344
Okay?

34:45.379 --> 34:46.034
It was a mistake!

34:46.068 --> 34:47.034
Okay, listen Craig.

34:47.068 --> 34:49.034
This is months I've been
telling you about this.

34:49.068 --> 34:51.379
I've been asking you
numerous times to stop!

34:51.413 --> 34:52.620
And it's done!

34:52.655 --> 34:53.482
We are done Craig!

34:55.103 --> 34:55.965
I swear.

34:56.000 --> 34:59.172
I had no idea what
he was going to do.

34:59.206 --> 35:02.275
And it was his idea to
send the hand to Jamaica.

35:02.310 --> 35:03.724
If I didn't-

35:03.758 --> 35:06.103
he would turn me
in for the tax fraud.

35:06.137 --> 35:07.862
All the evidence is
at your house though.

35:07.896 --> 35:09.482
It's his word
against yours.

35:10.758 --> 35:13.620
No one is going
to believe me!

35:15.379 --> 35:17.068
I'm not sure
that's true, Craig.

35:20.172 --> 35:22.172
You see, I want to put
the right person behind bars-

35:22.206 --> 35:23.275
for Kadi's murder.

35:25.103 --> 35:26.620
And you're going
to help me.

35:34.241 --> 35:35.931
Archie, I'm freaking out.

35:36.620 --> 35:38.689
We've got to meet
somewhere today.

35:40.344 --> 35:41.620
No, no.

35:41.655 --> 35:42.689
Somewhere public.

35:43.275 --> 35:45.206
The pub on Adelaide Street?

35:46.758 --> 35:47.482
Yeah.

35:48.275 --> 35:48.931
Yeah okay.

35:50.137 --> 35:50.758
All set.

35:50.793 --> 35:51.827
Okay.

35:52.793 --> 35:53.551
Okay Craig.

35:55.310 --> 35:56.482
There we go.

35:56.517 --> 35:59.103
Now if you can just
do me a favour-

35:59.137 --> 35:59.965
and speak
into the mic.

36:00.000 --> 36:01.344
Make sure this works.

36:01.379 --> 36:02.655
Today's the day
I'm going to die.

36:04.034 --> 36:05.413
Today's
the day I'm going to die.

36:05.448 --> 36:06.689
Excellent, he's all yours.

36:07.000 --> 36:07.965
Okay.

36:08.000 --> 36:09.965
Just breathe, okay?

36:10.482 --> 36:11.172
Try and act natural.

36:11.206 --> 36:12.206
You don't want
to spook him.

36:12.241 --> 36:13.413
You just want to
get him talking.

36:13.448 --> 36:14.758
I forget what I'm
supposed to say.

36:14.793 --> 36:15.827
Hey.

36:15.862 --> 36:17.310
How about that
your conscience-

36:17.344 --> 36:19.103
just got the
better of you?

36:19.137 --> 36:20.103
Okay?

36:20.137 --> 36:20.827
Hey.

36:20.862 --> 36:21.689
Craig.

36:22.482 --> 36:23.413
Don't worry.

36:23.586 --> 36:24.931
Archie's not going
to do anything to you-

36:24.965 --> 36:25.689
in a public place.

36:25.724 --> 36:27.379
He values his
image too much.

36:27.413 --> 36:28.413
You don't
know Archie.

36:28.448 --> 36:30.172
You don't know
what he's capable of.

36:30.862 --> 36:32.413
Well, I suppose you
do know that part.

36:32.448 --> 36:33.275
Craig.

36:33.310 --> 36:34.586
You're going
to be fine.

36:35.482 --> 36:36.310
Okay?

36:36.448 --> 36:37.620
And just remember.

36:37.724 --> 36:39.620
You've got our secret
weapon by your side.

36:46.413 --> 36:47.310
Testing testing.

36:49.689 --> 36:50.482
Jane.

36:50.517 --> 36:51.206
I'll take a pint.

36:56.000 --> 36:56.655
Who's your friend?

37:00.103 --> 37:01.068
My new guard dog.

37:03.068 --> 37:03.758
So.

37:04.586 --> 37:05.551
What're you afraid
of little Craig?

37:05.586 --> 37:07.862
You have proven to be
a bit of a wild card.

37:07.965 --> 37:09.896
Ah thank
you so much.

37:10.551 --> 37:12.034
What's the emergency?

37:12.137 --> 37:13.310
I can't sleep.

37:13.724 --> 37:14.379
I can't eat.

37:14.413 --> 37:15.068
I can't drink.

37:15.103 --> 37:16.068
Can you?

37:16.103 --> 37:16.965
Mmm.

37:17.827 --> 37:18.482
So good.

37:20.241 --> 37:21.896
What seems to be
bothering you?

37:22.000 --> 37:22.862
The guilt!

37:23.310 --> 37:24.551
It's eating me alive!

37:24.586 --> 37:26.137
Have you tried
talking to a shrink?

37:26.655 --> 37:27.551
What would
I tell them?

37:27.586 --> 37:29.586
That's entirely
up to you.

37:29.689 --> 37:31.758
How about I tell
them how long-

37:31.793 --> 37:33.689
it took me to
clean the blood up?

37:33.724 --> 37:34.896
Would that be
a good start?

37:36.896 --> 37:37.620
Come here.

37:37.655 --> 37:38.344
What?

37:38.379 --> 37:39.344
Come here.

37:39.896 --> 37:40.551
Ughh!

37:44.034 --> 37:45.379
You take me
for a real fool.

37:45.413 --> 37:47.551
I can't go to jail
for this Archie!

37:48.172 --> 37:50.586
I told that
Jamaican girl-

37:50.620 --> 37:52.344
to go back where
she came from.

37:52.379 --> 37:54.206
She thinks she
can come in here-

37:54.241 --> 37:56.275
and do things better than we've
been doing for generations?

37:56.379 --> 37:57.310
No.

37:58.758 --> 38:00.758
You saw what
I did to her.

38:00.793 --> 38:03.310
And you come here thinking
you can outsmart me?

38:03.344 --> 38:04.965
They made
me do it!

38:05.000 --> 38:05.793
Yeah.

38:07.275 --> 38:10.448
I am sorry that you've gotten
yourself into trouble, Craig.

38:11.310 --> 38:12.068
Mmm!

38:12.517 --> 38:13.241
But-

38:14.241 --> 38:15.517
I can't help you.

38:17.172 --> 38:18.137
Hey Archie.

38:18.241 --> 38:18.896
Huh!

38:20.172 --> 38:20.965
Hudson.

38:21.620 --> 38:22.413
Mmm.

38:22.448 --> 38:24.034
Well, you've got
nothing on me.

38:28.827 --> 38:29.896
No.

38:29.931 --> 38:31.103
I think we
have enough.

38:31.137 --> 38:32.103
You see-

38:33.000 --> 38:34.068
you forgot one.

38:36.413 --> 38:38.103
She thinks
she can come in here-

38:38.137 --> 38:40.413
and do things better than we've
been doing for generations?

38:40.448 --> 38:41.137
No.

38:41.172 --> 38:42.620
You saw what
I did to her.

38:44.931 --> 38:47.241
This is when you
turn around.

38:47.275 --> 38:48.172
Come on.

38:49.068 --> 38:49.896
Ughh!!

38:51.275 --> 38:52.000
Rex.

38:53.551 --> 38:54.206
Move!

39:10.000 --> 39:11.103
Let's try this
again shall we?

39:12.344 --> 39:14.586
Archie Parsons.

39:14.620 --> 39:16.827
You're under arrest for
the murder of Kadi Barrett.

39:17.586 --> 39:18.482
Come on.

39:20.344 --> 39:22.206
Fun to switch it up every
now and again huh pal?

39:33.724 --> 39:34.448
Nothing.

39:35.689 --> 39:37.517
I was hoping the shift change
would prove more fruitful.

39:39.310 --> 39:41.241
I don't know Karma.

39:41.275 --> 39:43.758
I mean, I've worked
with these guys for years.

39:43.793 --> 39:45.379
They're good people.

39:48.379 --> 39:49.689
Okay.

39:49.724 --> 39:52.896
I'll tell Superintendent
Donovan that I lost the ring.

39:52.931 --> 39:57.275
And I'll just hope that with his
wealth of experience and wisdom-

39:57.310 --> 39:58.551
that he'll recognizes
my clear conscience.

39:59.275 --> 39:59.896
Shhh.

39:59.931 --> 40:01.172
Do you hear that?

40:20.344 --> 40:21.034
Uh-

40:21.137 --> 40:21.793
Shh!

40:36.965 --> 40:37.965
Rex!

40:39.586 --> 40:40.275
Ohh.

40:41.793 --> 40:43.689
Oh, you don't
have to apologize!

40:43.724 --> 40:45.758
I shouldn't have left it out
where you could get it!

40:45.793 --> 40:46.896
It's just too tempting!

40:46.931 --> 40:48.241
You're not the first person
to make that mistake.

40:48.275 --> 40:49.034
Right buddy?

40:49.724 --> 40:50.655
Okay!

40:52.482 --> 40:53.413
There you go.

40:57.034 --> 40:58.034
Take a look.

40:58.931 --> 41:00.517
Oh my Goddess!

41:00.965 --> 41:01.655
Oh my-

41:01.689 --> 41:02.551
Yeah!

41:02.586 --> 41:03.241
Her.

41:03.275 --> 41:03.931
Oh my!

41:04.517 --> 41:05.482
Rex!

41:06.206 --> 41:06.827
You-

41:07.517 --> 41:08.448
You are sneaky Rex.

41:08.482 --> 41:09.379
That's for sure.

41:19.862 --> 41:21.034
Cedar smudged cod.

41:21.068 --> 41:23.034
Margarita inspired?

41:23.068 --> 41:23.689
Mmmm.

41:23.724 --> 41:25.137
We should
pick some up.

41:25.172 --> 41:26.862
Yeah, I think Rex
would like some too.

41:28.862 --> 41:30.448
Whatever you'd
like to try.

41:30.482 --> 41:31.310
I insist.

41:31.344 --> 41:32.310
Take some home.

41:33.344 --> 41:34.689
Can we chat?

41:35.517 --> 41:36.206
Yeah.

41:38.586 --> 41:39.241
Come.

41:39.275 --> 41:40.206
Come with me.

41:41.620 --> 41:43.620
It's pretty nice
of you to host us.

41:43.655 --> 41:45.862
It's what we
do back home.

41:45.896 --> 41:48.172
Toast and eat to
celebrate our loved ones.

41:48.965 --> 41:49.896
Well our traditions-

41:49.931 --> 41:50.758
aren't that different.

41:52.413 --> 41:53.482
Fish and rum.

41:54.379 --> 41:55.034
It's perfect.

41:56.931 --> 41:59.965
I'm sorry I doubted
you Charlie.

42:00.000 --> 42:01.931
My judgment was clouded.

42:01.965 --> 42:03.068
Yeah, no need
to apologize.

42:03.103 --> 42:04.068
And as for
your judgment-

42:04.103 --> 42:05.482
it was spot on
about Archie.

42:05.517 --> 42:07.896
We have a very strong
case against him.

42:07.931 --> 42:09.620
I hope that brings
you some comfort.

42:10.862 --> 42:11.931
Come.

42:11.965 --> 42:14.034
Let's eat while
it's still warm.

42:14.068 --> 42:16.413
So- what do
we have here?

42:16.448 --> 42:17.448
It's ackee and saltfish.

42:17.482 --> 42:18.103
Jamaica's national dish.

42:18.137 --> 42:18.758
Oh!

42:18.793 --> 42:19.655
And homemade pepper sauce.

42:19.689 --> 42:20.586
Proceed with caution.

42:21.965 --> 42:22.620
It's really good.

42:22.655 --> 42:24.379
Hot hot
hot hot hot!

42:32.379 --> 42:34.034
Once Kadi's body
is released-

42:34.068 --> 42:36.000
I'll take her
back to Jamaica.

42:36.310 --> 42:37.620
But I'll be back.

42:37.724 --> 42:40.310
Someone's going to have to
carry on with the business.

42:40.344 --> 42:42.379
It's what Kadi would
want, you know?

42:43.137 --> 42:43.965
I agree.

42:44.931 --> 42:46.931
And I for one will be
a regular customer.

42:48.931 --> 42:52.000
Thank you all for being here
to celebrate my sister, Kadi.

42:53.517 --> 42:54.241
To Kadi.

42:55.482 --> 42:56.344
To Kadi.

42:56.965 --> 42:57.758
To Kadi.

42:57.862 --> 42:58.586
To Kadi.

42:58.689 --> 43:00.206
To Kadi.

43:01.724 --> 43:03.482
Thank you.
