00:03.330 --> 00:05.460
You know, I was younger
than you are know by the time

00:05.500 --> 00:07.170
I had Christian.

00:07.210 --> 00:09.260
If that's your way of bragging,
it's really, really creepy.

00:09.300 --> 00:10.670
I'm just saying,

00:10.710 --> 00:12.670
it's time for you to be thinking
about having a family.

00:12.720 --> 00:14.300
There's a couple of key
ingredients that are missing for

00:14.340 --> 00:15.720
me to have a family.

00:15.760 --> 00:18.510
For one, I need a mother, you
know, to unborn children

00:18.560 --> 00:19.930
I don't have.

00:19.970 --> 00:22.060
Don't be foolish. Leslie would
be a fantastic mother.

00:22.980 --> 00:24.270
The way she puts up with you,

00:24.310 --> 00:26.270
it's obvious
she'd be great with children.

00:28.110 --> 00:30.980
Ha! Leslie's hot man. You gotta,
you gotta knock her up.

00:31.030 --> 00:33.740
And that way she'll have to
commit to ya, even though

00:33.780 --> 00:35.860
everybody knows she's
out of your league.

00:35.910 --> 00:39.080
Okay, look, I can't believe
that someone made you a crown

00:39.120 --> 00:40.580
attorney in St. John's.

00:40.620 --> 00:42.290
What, were all the
other job applicants out

00:42.330 --> 00:43.910
with food poisoning?

00:43.960 --> 00:47.790
Ha ha! I'm a crown. Yeah, it's
scary, isn't it? Yeah.

00:47.840 --> 00:49.500
Now I got the power to um,

00:50.630 --> 00:51.670
like, you know...

00:51.710 --> 00:52.800
I dunno.

00:52.840 --> 00:54.090
I'll figure it out
on Monday, I s'pose.

00:54.130 --> 00:56.930
Jake, here, hold this a minute.

00:56.970 --> 00:59.140
[sirens]
Never saw this guy before. Bye!

01:02.470 --> 01:04.390
Hood! What are you running like

01:04.440 --> 01:06.480
a drinking in public sting,
or what?

01:06.520 --> 01:08.480
When's the last time you heard
from Leslie Bennett?

01:08.520 --> 01:10.360
Not since she went under cover.
Why?

01:10.400 --> 01:12.530
You're not gonna get her into
any trouble, but I need to know.

01:12.570 --> 01:14.450
When was the last time
you heard from her?

01:14.490 --> 01:16.240
Been a while. What's going on?

01:16.280 --> 01:18.910
She's supposed
to check in every day, but --

01:18.950 --> 01:22.330
You lost track of her?
How long has it been?

01:22.370 --> 01:24.040
-A week.
-A week?

01:25.790 --> 01:28.670
You and I, we've had our
differences. But I'm worried.

01:28.710 --> 01:29.880
If we send a cop in there --

01:29.920 --> 01:31.590
You'll blow her cover
and get her killed?

01:32.380 --> 01:33.960
What do you want me to do?

01:34.010 --> 01:36.090
I need you to go check out her
cover apartment, see if there's

01:36.130 --> 01:37.430
any trace of her.

01:38.550 --> 01:40.310
I'll be in touch, okay?

01:47.480 --> 01:48.520
What was that all about?

01:50.020 --> 01:51.730
It's Leslie...

01:52.440 --> 01:53.650
She's missing.

Well, Leslie's been working
an undercover case

02:19.550 --> 02:20.970
as Jen Pelletier.

02:21.010 --> 02:23.060
She's getting close to Taylor
Gossard, our friendly

02:23.100 --> 02:24.640
neighborhood Oxy peddler.

02:24.680 --> 02:26.390
I should of dealt with him
when I had the chance.

02:26.430 --> 02:27.600
If he's hurt Leslie --

02:27.640 --> 02:28.810
[Rose] Leslie's had
a lot of opportunities

02:28.850 --> 02:29.690
to take Taylor down,

02:29.730 --> 02:31.150
but she just hasn't done it yet.

02:31.190 --> 02:33.150
Yeah, it's because she's after
a bigger fish, alright.

02:33.190 --> 02:36.280
She's looking for Taylor's boss,
whoever's funneling him drugs.

02:36.320 --> 02:38.490
Your dad and I are heading down
to his bar. We're gonna see if

02:38.530 --> 02:40.110
there's anything there
that points to Leslie.

02:40.160 --> 02:42.320
No, no, no, no. Look,
Taylor knows me and Dad.

02:42.370 --> 02:43.740
We can't blow her cover.

02:43.780 --> 02:45.410
Well there's no way
he'll remember me.

02:45.450 --> 02:47.250
It'll be fine. I've met a lot of
Taylors in my life.

02:47.290 --> 02:48.500
I can handle it.

02:48.540 --> 02:50.250
Be careful. Just keep me posted.
I gotta go.

03:03.300 --> 03:05.680
What's the mall cop
doing here again?

03:42.090 --> 03:44.050
75 Harbor Drive.

03:47.220 --> 03:49.520
[Des] Hello.
You have a lovely smile.

03:49.560 --> 03:52.560
Hola. Tiene una bonita sonrisa.

03:53.940 --> 03:56.770
Hello. Where is the closest
nuclear power plant?

03:56.820 --> 03:58.570
I'd say New Brunswick.

03:59.860 --> 04:02.650
Al Kavanagh? In the Doyle house?
No, no, no, no.

04:02.700 --> 04:07.200
I'm sure he wants to prove
to Malachy and Jake what a good

04:07.950 --> 04:10.500
investigator you are.

04:10.540 --> 04:12.210
Whoa, serious hottie.

04:12.250 --> 04:13.790
That's my wife.

04:13.830 --> 04:16.840
I mean she's ugly. I mean she's
not, she's not ugly, I mean,

04:16.880 --> 04:19.670
I don't find her attractive --
I mean, she seems really nice.

04:19.710 --> 04:21.050
Does she have a sister?

04:21.090 --> 04:22.800
I think she's cheating on me.

04:22.840 --> 04:24.340
Yes. Of course.

04:24.390 --> 04:25.970
Shall I go on?

04:26.010 --> 04:27.720
Yes, of course.

04:27.760 --> 04:30.640
I hear she's shacked up
at this motel with some skeet.

04:30.680 --> 04:34.140
There's the address. Room 109,
I think. The plan is you keep

04:34.190 --> 04:35.980
in touch with me
with anything you see

04:36.020 --> 04:37.320
that's suspicious at the motel.

04:38.110 --> 04:39.190
Can you be more specific?

04:39.230 --> 04:40.690
Anything suspicious,

04:40.730 --> 04:42.860
call me immediately
and keep this between us.

04:44.160 --> 04:45.860
I don't think Malachy
would take too kindly

04:45.910 --> 04:47.870
to you working for me.

04:51.410 --> 04:52.410
Adios.

04:54.330 --> 04:57.710
[ring]
Yeah, what do you want?

04:57.750 --> 04:59.130
Jake.
I really need your guidance,

04:59.170 --> 05:00.630
right at this very moment.

05:00.670 --> 05:03.050
Des, I'm in the middle of
something, alright? So I can't,

05:03.090 --> 05:04.970
you know, help you pick out
which sweater vest to buy.

05:05.010 --> 05:06.890
No, no, no, no. I have this
moral dilemma and I have

05:06.930 --> 05:09.180
a client that has no morals.
I mean, I mean, we all love

05:09.220 --> 05:10.760
the odd dollar, right?

05:10.810 --> 05:13.430
Leslie's missing and she is in
danger. It's all got something

05:13.480 --> 05:14.890
to do with that scumbag
Taylor Gossard.

05:14.940 --> 05:17.730
What? The drug dealer guy
with the weird tattoos?

05:17.770 --> 05:20.690
Yeah, so if this isn't urgent,
I have to hang up on you.

05:20.730 --> 05:23.360
Yeah, I know. I can play this
out and see what happens.

05:23.400 --> 05:27.120
But let me know if I can help.
Okay? I'm here for you.

05:27.780 --> 05:28.990
Okay. Thank you.

06:02.480 --> 06:04.900
Jen Pelletier.
That's Leslie's undercover name.

06:32.470 --> 06:34.220
Leslie.

06:35.310 --> 06:36.390
Oh no.

06:37.850 --> 06:39.440
I'm so sorry, Walter,
I gotta run.

06:39.480 --> 06:40.980
Des, where's Kathleen?

06:41.020 --> 06:42.060
I'm gone. I'm gone.

06:42.110 --> 06:42.940
I'm here. What's wrong?

06:43.610 --> 06:45.190
What is your problem?

06:45.230 --> 06:47.030
Well besides everything else
that I have to deal with today,

06:47.070 --> 06:48.360
I thought you should
know something.

06:48.400 --> 06:49.570
Well, that doesn't sound good.

06:49.610 --> 06:51.910
Before I accepted my new
position as Crown --

06:51.950 --> 06:53.580
Oh, congratulations, by the way.

06:53.620 --> 06:57.660
Yes, thank you. I saw a former
client of mine, Kevin Crocker.

06:57.710 --> 06:59.160
Um hm?

06:59.210 --> 07:04.210
Now he told me that Tinny's been
visiting him. Like, a lot.

07:05.460 --> 07:07.130
Oh but you already knew that,
didn't you?

07:08.220 --> 07:11.180
Ah, you know,
I'm just gonna ask.

07:11.220 --> 07:15.060
Ah, what exactly is his
relationship to Katrina?

07:16.100 --> 07:17.560
He's Tinny's father.

07:18.850 --> 07:20.440
Of course he is.

07:25.610 --> 07:28.110
Taylor. That buddy.
What the hell is he doing here?

07:30.150 --> 07:32.110
Room 109.

07:33.530 --> 07:35.740
Ah, that can't be good.

07:44.580 --> 07:46.460
[Taylor] Finally.
Why'd you need me

07:46.500 --> 07:48.880
to stay in this
crap stained motel room anyways?

07:48.920 --> 07:52.300
I didn't realize you had such
a delicate constitution.

07:52.340 --> 07:53.390
You think that's funny.

07:53.430 --> 07:55.890
This is the way
that we do business.

07:55.930 --> 07:57.930
Okay? You need to stay
chilled, little man.

07:59.520 --> 08:02.310
You know, I've been waiting
a week to hear from you tools.

08:03.600 --> 08:06.110
Just looking for a little
respect, that's all.

08:06.150 --> 08:08.610
Relax, okay?
I had to check around.

08:09.780 --> 08:11.740
Make sure you were
cool to do the deal.

08:11.780 --> 08:14.950
So when do I get to meet
your supplier? The boss?

08:14.990 --> 08:17.080
Why are you so keen
to meet the boss, hm?

08:17.120 --> 08:18.950
I just like to know
who makes the decisions.

08:18.990 --> 08:20.700
Well now, that kind of talk

08:20.750 --> 08:21.500
makes you sound
a little too eager.

08:22.830 --> 08:24.540
We are nervous about
people that are too eager.

08:24.580 --> 08:25.960
You know what?

08:26.000 --> 08:28.750
This whole thing feels
like you're a bunch of amateurs.

08:28.800 --> 08:31.260
Okay, you need to stop
talking and listen.

08:31.300 --> 08:32.670
You're this close

08:32.720 --> 08:34.970
from not being able to use
that mouth of yours again.

08:35.010 --> 08:37.890
So you get this straight.
You do what you're told,

08:38.510 --> 08:38.850
when you're told.

08:39.770 --> 08:41.430
I decide what happens next.

08:44.400 --> 08:47.730
[ring]
Yeah.

08:47.770 --> 08:49.070
[Des] You know that case
you don't care about?

08:49.110 --> 08:50.230
Des.

08:50.280 --> 08:51.820
Al Kavanagh hired me
to spy on his wife.

08:51.860 --> 08:53.440
Why is anybody hiring
you to do anything?

08:53.490 --> 08:55.740
Uh, because I'm really talented
and I have an eye for detail?

08:55.780 --> 08:58.700
But guess what I just happened
to stumble upon right now?

08:59.200 --> 09:00.660
Who, Des? Who?

09:00.700 --> 09:03.660
Your best bud. Taylor the
Oxyhead. Obviously I was being

09:03.710 --> 09:06.000
sarcastic about
the best bud comment.

09:06.040 --> 09:07.540
Okay, tell me,
have you seen Leslie there?

09:07.580 --> 09:09.130
No, no. But I think Kavanagh

09:09.170 --> 09:11.420
hired me to spy on Taylor and
not his wife. Is that insane?

09:12.170 --> 09:13.720
It's not insane. Look.

09:15.300 --> 09:17.970
I saw Kavanagh outside Leslie's
apartment. I'm telling you

09:18.010 --> 09:19.140
this whole thing is linked.

09:19.180 --> 09:20.600
Okay, but Jake,

09:20.640 --> 09:22.560
there's some biker dude
with Taylor and he looks mean.

09:24.180 --> 09:27.770
Don't make any moves until I get
there. And don't tell Kavanagh

09:27.810 --> 09:30.270
anything until we figure
out what he wants.

09:36.320 --> 09:37.860
Find anything?

09:37.910 --> 09:39.870
Well, Taylor hasn't been in for
about a week. He disappeared

09:39.910 --> 09:41.490
around the same time Leslie did.

09:41.530 --> 09:44.370
I gotta be honest. I'm starting
to get worried. Undercover can

09:44.410 --> 09:46.870
push you to a place that's hard
to come back from. Trust me.

09:46.910 --> 09:50.340
Well let's hope she's not in too
deep. For her's and Jake's sake.

09:50.380 --> 09:52.960
Let's get back. Hopefully
Jake's had more success.

10:00.390 --> 10:02.680
Uh, Taylor's still inside.

10:02.720 --> 10:05.480
Alright. Kavanagh wants you
to keep an eye on Taylor.

10:05.520 --> 10:07.480
But why? What did he say?

10:07.520 --> 10:09.850
His wife was cheating on him
and that she was staying here?

10:09.900 --> 10:11.020
Yeah, but I checked.
Kavanagh has no wife.

10:12.690 --> 10:16.190
I mean how dumb does he think I
am? Unless that's the reason why

10:16.240 --> 10:18.280
he hired me in the first place.
That does hurt. You know,

10:18.320 --> 10:20.030
I bet she's just some missus
from the internet.

10:20.070 --> 10:21.570
I thought I saw her
in a soap commercial.

10:21.620 --> 10:24.700
Maybe he's using this as a way
to keep an eye on me.

10:25.950 --> 10:27.910
Des, the biker and Taylor --
they're leaving.

10:27.960 --> 10:30.250
Oh, wait, wait, wait. He's
either saying, I'm all about

10:30.290 --> 10:33.840
Skipper and Company
or I'm headed to the bar.

10:33.880 --> 10:35.550
I was on Skipper and Company.

10:35.590 --> 10:37.130
Let's go inside.

10:37.170 --> 10:39.760
See if we can find any trace
of Leslie, alright?

10:49.020 --> 10:50.150
Well, you're not using any of
the techniques you taught me

10:50.190 --> 10:51.770
how to search a room.

10:51.810 --> 10:53.980
Des, look around, okay? See if
you can find anything belonging

10:54.020 --> 10:56.190
to Leslie -- I need to know
if she was in this room.

10:57.780 --> 11:03.450
Ah gross, Jake, I don't
think it's Taylor's size.

11:03.490 --> 11:05.910
Oh, it could be. It's kinda hard
to tell with the naked eye.

11:05.950 --> 11:07.330
Oh, women's, no, that's not his.

11:07.370 --> 11:08.870
It could be Leslie's.

11:08.910 --> 11:12.460
Oh-oh! It could be the staff.
I saw this news report where

11:12.500 --> 11:15.420
late night hotel workers do sex
things in the rooms.

11:18.380 --> 11:19.550
What is it?

11:19.590 --> 11:20.840
Leslie's been here.

11:22.180 --> 11:23.390
I saw her wear this necklace.

11:23.430 --> 11:24.810
Whoa, Jake, what is this?

11:26.430 --> 11:27.680
This is Chloroform.

11:27.720 --> 11:29.930
Oh my god, people use this
to knock people out.

11:29.980 --> 11:32.650
I mean not that anyone would use
this to knock Leslie out.

11:32.690 --> 11:33.900
[ring] [sniff]

11:36.730 --> 11:38.860
[thud]

11:40.490 --> 11:41.410
Hood.

11:41.450 --> 11:43.570
Doyle. Bad news.

11:43.620 --> 11:45.200
Some kids phoned it in.

11:45.950 --> 11:47.120
They said they saw what

11:47.160 --> 11:49.080
looked like a body floating
in the harbor.

11:49.870 --> 11:50.750
So we dragged it.

11:52.080 --> 11:54.630
What's left of it matches
Leslie's description.

12:02.380 --> 12:03.550
I know what you're up to.

12:03.590 --> 12:04.720
Monica.

12:04.760 --> 12:06.350
Hood brought me up to speed.

12:07.810 --> 12:09.220
I'm on your side.

12:09.270 --> 12:12.100
This all has to stay
very hush-hush.

12:12.140 --> 12:15.100
Jake, I know everything.
And you need to take this in.

12:15.150 --> 12:17.320
Although the body is damaged
beyond recognition, the rest

12:17.360 --> 12:18.570
matches Leslie's description.

12:19.440 --> 12:22.400
It's not Leslie.
I know it.

12:22.450 --> 12:25.240
We're waiting on some tests.
Dental records, blood type.

12:26.490 --> 12:28.410
It'll be a while until
we get the results.

12:29.830 --> 12:31.160
Where do you think you're going?

12:31.200 --> 12:33.210
I'm gonna find the alive Leslie.

12:33.250 --> 12:36.710
And do not blow her cover or
she'll actually end up dead.

12:36.750 --> 12:39.000
Jake, we can't keep
this under wraps forever.

12:44.340 --> 12:45.800
[Malachy] Wait a minute.

12:45.840 --> 12:48.180
Des was at the same motel as
Taylor? How did that happen?

12:48.220 --> 12:51.100
Al Kavanagh hired him, okay,
to follow his wife. But it turns

12:51.140 --> 12:52.890
out Kavanagh was never married.

12:52.930 --> 12:54.350
I coulda told you that.

12:54.390 --> 12:56.770
First off, why is Des taking
cases? And especially from

12:56.810 --> 12:58.270
a sleveen like Kavanagh?

12:58.310 --> 12:59.530
He was using Des to keep
an eye on me and Taylor.

13:00.940 --> 13:04.650
He specifically told Des
to watch a motel. Room 109.

13:04.700 --> 13:06.070
-That was Taylor's room.
-Exactly.

13:06.110 --> 13:07.240
What's Kavanagh's game here?

13:07.280 --> 13:08.740
I dunno. What did you find
in Taylor's bar.

13:08.780 --> 13:10.700
Well it turns out Taylor hasn't
been there in a week.

13:10.740 --> 13:12.080
Around when Leslie went missing.

13:12.120 --> 13:14.460
Yeah, we've also been checking
into this biker guy.

13:14.500 --> 13:17.130
Charlie Archer. He's a biker
from Montreal connected

13:17.170 --> 13:18.750
to some U.S. syndicates.

13:18.790 --> 13:20.840
He's been arrested on a bunch of
drug charges and some violent

13:20.880 --> 13:22.090
assaults and he was also charged
with murder once.

13:23.510 --> 13:25.470
But they couldn't get enough
evidence against him.

13:25.510 --> 13:26.970
You're not gonna believe
who arrested him

13:27.010 --> 13:28.390
in Lab City a few years back.

13:29.260 --> 13:30.640
Leslie Bennett.

13:30.680 --> 13:34.230
I know in my heart
that Leslie is still alive.

13:34.270 --> 13:36.020
But if this biker sees her --

13:36.060 --> 13:38.020
If he sees here, he'll be able
to make her as a cop.

13:38.060 --> 13:39.440
Des said he overheard something

13:39.480 --> 13:41.110
about a meet
between Charlie and Taylor.

13:41.150 --> 13:42.280
Do you think this guy Charlie

13:42.320 --> 13:44.150
is the big fish
Leslie was looking for?

13:44.190 --> 13:45.150
Could be.

13:45.200 --> 13:46.780
Either way, I think it's time

13:46.820 --> 13:49.200
I paid a little
visit to our friend Taylor.

13:49.240 --> 13:50.870
We'll stay on Kavanagh.

13:59.330 --> 14:04.630
Hola! Desmond. Jack of all
trades and master of none.

14:04.670 --> 14:06.550
Haven't heard from you.
Not falling down on the job,

14:06.590 --> 14:08.090
now are we nipper?

14:08.130 --> 14:11.220
No, no, no, no. And you'll be
happy to know that your wife

14:11.260 --> 14:15.980
hasn't show up here. So that,
sir, you can take to the bank

14:16.730 --> 14:19.400
and cash it for money.

14:19.440 --> 14:20.610
Yes.

14:21.230 --> 14:22.320
Who's this now?

14:22.360 --> 14:24.820
Uh, no one.
I don't know him, or them.

14:24.860 --> 14:26.650
And yet you have
pictures of them.

14:26.690 --> 14:28.660
Buddy and the biker
are the only ones

14:28.700 --> 14:29.780
that have been in that room.

14:29.820 --> 14:31.160
Not that I'm judging.

14:31.200 --> 14:34.540
Taylor Gossard is his name.
Keep a close eye on him.

14:34.580 --> 14:39.120
I think he's the guy who's been
getting familiar with my woman.

14:42.040 --> 14:44.050
So has Jake been
around here yet?

14:45.050 --> 14:45.090
Jake Doyle.

14:45.920 --> 14:47.510
Uh, why would you ask that?

14:47.550 --> 14:50.090
Uh, it's just that I've seen
Jake in a few places laces that

14:50.130 --> 14:51.640
I don't feel
comfortable seeing him.

14:51.680 --> 14:55.260
Oh ha ha right.
Oh, man, I've been there bro.

14:55.310 --> 14:59.350
You know, accidental shower
walk-in. Yuk b'y. Ahem.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.940
Look I knows where
your loyalties lie.

15:02.980 --> 15:06.440
I'm not suggesting you rat on
your boss. I'm just saying,

15:06.480 --> 15:13.160
if you see Jake Doyle with the
biker, or Taylor, let me know.

15:14.280 --> 15:15.620
[ring]

15:17.620 --> 15:19.620
-[bang]
-What was that?

15:19.660 --> 15:21.830
I didn't, I didn't get a good
look. Did you happened to --

15:21.870 --> 15:25.500
It's faulty equipment. It must
be the moisture in the van air.

15:27.090 --> 15:31.470
See it happens all the time.
You know Malachy. He's too cheap

15:31.510 --> 15:37.810
to buy the -- the moisture free
gear for the... van.

15:37.850 --> 15:41.440
You should get them fixed.
Remember the plan, Des.

15:52.990 --> 15:54.660
[Taylor]
Hey! What the hell man?

15:54.700 --> 15:56.370
I'm gonna ask you ask you a
couple of questions and you

15:56.410 --> 15:58.120
better hope that
I like your answers.

15:59.830 --> 16:01.330
You shouldn't have done that.

16:01.370 --> 16:03.750
You loves playing with
the knives, don't you buddy?

16:03.790 --> 16:06.090
It's time we finished this once
and for all, hey?

16:06.130 --> 16:07.460
Sounds good to me dicksmack.

16:08.510 --> 16:09.760
[thud] Aaah.

16:11.220 --> 16:13.220
-[bang]
-[smash] Aaah.

16:14.510 --> 16:15.470
Ha ha ha ha.

16:17.310 --> 16:18.350
What?

16:18.390 --> 16:19.310
[crack]

16:19.350 --> 16:20.850
[thud]

16:21.560 --> 16:23.350
Wooo.

16:23.390 --> 16:25.110
Let's get the stuff and get out
of here. This one smells

16:25.150 --> 16:26.150
like a cop to me.

16:26.190 --> 16:27.940
No, he's no cop.

16:27.980 --> 16:30.940
I know this one real good,
don't I, Jakey? He's a P.I.

16:32.200 --> 16:33.700
He could be working
with the cops. Let's go.

16:33.740 --> 16:37.870
He might have back up. Let's get
out of here. Come on. Go!

16:44.540 --> 16:48.590
That was well done.
Well done girl, huh? Smash!

16:50.210 --> 16:52.670
I just wish you'd let me finish
him off. Been wanting to gut

16:52.720 --> 16:54.340
that fella since I met him.

16:54.380 --> 16:55.510
Yes b'y going around
murdering people

16:55.550 --> 16:56.850
in the middle of this deal?

16:56.890 --> 16:58.390
Brilliant idea.

16:58.430 --> 17:00.100
Look, okay, use your head.
We don't wanna blow this.

17:01.310 --> 17:03.640
No need to go worrying about me,
princess.

17:03.690 --> 17:05.190
I've gotten rid of

17:05.230 --> 17:07.020
lots of people
no one knows about.

17:07.060 --> 17:08.190
Alright, big boy.

17:08.230 --> 17:09.520
Let's just get the job done.

17:09.570 --> 17:11.070
Then you can go on a rampage,
okay?

17:11.110 --> 17:13.030
You wanna meet Big Charlie?

17:13.070 --> 17:14.740
Is that your nickname for --

17:15.530 --> 17:18.030
No. Big Charlie Archer --

17:18.070 --> 17:19.830
He's our contact with the
bikers. Heard of him, have you?

17:21.240 --> 17:25.040
No, I just, I heard his name
in the news, I s'pose.

17:25.080 --> 17:26.710
And don't you worry,
I'll introduce ye.

17:27.580 --> 17:28.750
I say he'll like you.

17:30.050 --> 17:31.210
I know I like you.

17:31.250 --> 17:33.420
I don't know why you need this
Charlie guy.

17:33.460 --> 17:35.720
As far as I've heard,
he's a middle man.

17:35.760 --> 17:37.430
You don't need middle men.

17:37.470 --> 17:39.470
You should be dealing
with bosses.

17:40.390 --> 17:42.930
Look at you,
all ambitious.

17:42.970 --> 17:45.020
I love it,
I must say, I do.

17:45.060 --> 17:47.560
But for now,
I need Big Charlie.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.060
He's my way in.

17:49.110 --> 17:51.020
He can lead you
to the bigger fish?

17:51.070 --> 17:52.570
You're smarter than you looks.

17:52.610 --> 17:56.910
Once I'm hooked in, we can
forget the Circle. Forget Oxy.

17:56.950 --> 17:58.570
We're talking...

17:59.740 --> 18:01.410
we're talking international.

18:01.450 --> 18:03.080
[motorcycle rumbles]

18:03.120 --> 18:04.290
Ah, show time.

18:04.330 --> 18:06.210
I should go.

18:06.250 --> 18:07.540
Hey, you're not
going nowhere woman.

18:08.460 --> 18:09.710
Come on.

18:09.750 --> 18:12.000
A bit of eye candy around.

18:12.040 --> 18:13.840
Make me look like
I got it going on.

18:15.300 --> 18:17.050
Go get us a beer.

18:27.230 --> 18:28.690
You got what I need?

18:28.730 --> 18:31.480
Or do I need to make a point
of never gracing the doorway

18:31.520 --> 18:33.150
of this dump again?

18:33.190 --> 18:36.450
I got everything you want man.
Don't you worry.

18:37.780 --> 18:38.910
This bag --

18:38.950 --> 18:40.200
a peace offering.

18:40.240 --> 18:41.070
She thought it'd look pretty
good on your bike?

18:42.660 --> 18:45.830
Your pretty friend buying me
presents, is she? Hello there.

18:46.870 --> 18:48.460
Very kind of you.

18:48.500 --> 18:50.630
Never mind that. I bought it.
I paid for it. It was her idea.

18:51.840 --> 18:54.130
Okay? So, are we gonna do
business or what?

18:56.340 --> 18:57.550
You know I've been doing
this a long time.

18:58.970 --> 19:02.680
And there's one thing that
really gets on my nerves.

19:02.720 --> 19:04.260
And what's that?

19:04.310 --> 19:07.850
Just because we're buying and
selling drugs, doesn't mean that

19:07.890 --> 19:09.520
we have to be
rude to each other.

19:10.100 --> 19:12.400
So tone it down.

19:18.400 --> 19:19.490
Leslie.

19:19.530 --> 19:21.030
Dude, good news, Leslie's alive.

19:21.070 --> 19:23.070
Bad news, her and Taylor knocked
you out. Even worse news,

19:23.120 --> 19:24.240
Kavanagh want me to watch you.

19:24.280 --> 19:25.660
Ugh...

19:26.750 --> 19:28.080
What the hell
are you talking about?

19:28.120 --> 19:30.790
Look at how much money Kavanagh
gave me. Heh, heh!

19:30.830 --> 19:32.080
Did Leslie leave with Taylor?

19:32.120 --> 19:34.040
Yeah, yeah. They got in his car
and drove off.

19:34.090 --> 19:35.800
You stay on Kavanagh, alright.

19:35.840 --> 19:37.420
We gotta figure out why he's
keeping tabs on me.

19:37.460 --> 19:40.010
Somehow it's all connected to
Leslie. I just, I just gotta

19:40.050 --> 19:41.510
figure out why.

19:41.550 --> 19:44.390
Okay -- and you -- you can
pay me back. It's fine.

19:47.390 --> 19:48.980
You look
very familiar.

19:50.690 --> 19:52.690
Have we met before?

19:52.730 --> 19:55.150
No. I knows who you are.

19:55.190 --> 19:57.190
That's 'cause everyone
knows who you are.

19:59.400 --> 20:00.320
Everybody.

20:01.240 --> 20:02.950
Hey man, speaking of rude --

20:02.990 --> 20:05.700
I could find out that it is
rather rude for you to be

20:05.740 --> 20:08.080
staring right
at your host's girl

20:09.120 --> 20:10.620
like she's a piece
of prime riblet.

20:10.660 --> 20:11.250
My apologies.

20:12.500 --> 20:14.630
She just looks very familiar,
that's all.

20:15.540 --> 20:17.880
So let's see what I came to see.

20:24.760 --> 20:26.680
That's what I'm talking about.

20:26.720 --> 20:28.720
It's all there, man.
You can count it if you like.

20:30.600 --> 20:32.560
But this other thing we were
talking about earlier.

20:32.600 --> 20:35.350
You know, I was wondering when,

20:35.400 --> 20:37.690
when I might get
to meet your supplier.

20:37.730 --> 20:39.400
You know,
you need to drop that.

20:39.440 --> 20:43.740
This is a replacement for your
Oxy, that's all, for now.

20:43.780 --> 20:45.160
I think you're making
a big mistake.

20:46.070 --> 20:47.830
I have so much more to offer.

20:47.870 --> 20:51.790
I could really help
you guys make inroads.

20:51.830 --> 20:53.410
I'm telling you--

20:53.460 --> 20:56.790
I get this meet the boss crap --
you guys are way dumber than

20:56.830 --> 20:59.340
I gave you credit for. This
isn't gonna stick. She's a --

20:59.380 --> 21:00.710
[crack]

21:00.750 --> 21:04.180
What? What are you doing.
What the hell is going on?

21:04.220 --> 21:07.050
He's a cop, Taylor,
he's a freakin' cop, okay.

21:07.090 --> 21:10.100
That's why he recognizes me.
He arrested me four years ago.

21:10.140 --> 21:11.180
He was just gonna bust you.

21:11.220 --> 21:12.680
What are you talking about?

21:12.730 --> 21:15.690
He's a rat. Use your head.
First a P.I. sneaking around.

21:15.730 --> 21:18.480
Now this cop. Lock the friggin'
door, quick. Hurry up.

21:18.520 --> 21:20.900
We gotta do something, fast.

21:22.530 --> 21:26.030
They've got an I.D. on that body
in the harbor. Cassidy Sanford.

21:26.070 --> 21:27.610
[Rose] Any idea who she is?

21:27.660 --> 21:30.580
She was a bartender in Taylor's
bar. Disappeared 2 days ago.

21:30.620 --> 21:31.990
Leslie knew her.

21:32.040 --> 21:34.790
Wait, wait, wait!
That chloroform I found.

21:34.830 --> 21:36.460
Taylor coulda
used that on the bartender.

21:36.500 --> 21:38.420
If Taylor figures out
Leslie's a cop --

21:38.460 --> 21:39.540
It could be a similar fate.

21:39.590 --> 21:41.340
I hope Jake tracks her down.
And soon.

21:41.380 --> 21:44.470
Des. You've been quite
the big entrepreneur.

21:44.510 --> 21:47.800
Taking cases from Al Kavanagh?
What did you find out?

21:47.840 --> 21:50.890
I mean if you still feel you can
share your information.

21:50.930 --> 21:53.600
I'm not sure. But Al's been
following Taylor, the biker,

21:53.640 --> 21:55.480
and, for some reason, Jake.

21:55.520 --> 21:58.810
Maybe he's the supplier Leslie
was after. The boss.

21:58.860 --> 22:00.190
We know he's a scumbag

22:00.230 --> 22:01.820
and he certainly
deals in a load of dirty crap.

22:01.860 --> 22:04.650
It makes sense right? Kavanagh
gets Des to track Taylor.

22:04.690 --> 22:06.070
I mean if you were going
to deal with Taylor,

22:06.110 --> 22:07.490
wouldn't you do your research?

22:07.530 --> 22:09.530
Oh plus -- Jake told me that he
saw Kavanagh outside

22:09.570 --> 22:11.080
Leslie's apartment last week.

22:11.120 --> 22:13.120
Maybe he's looking into Jen
Pelletier, Leslie's alter ego.

22:14.040 --> 22:15.830
Check this out guys. Alright?

22:15.870 --> 22:18.250
This is Al Kavanagh's credit
card statements.

22:18.290 --> 22:21.290
Multiple flights to and from
Montreal. That's Big Charlie's

22:21.340 --> 22:21.960
home city.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.590
Business trips.

22:23.630 --> 22:25.380
I'll stay on this. But in the
meantime, could you please call

22:25.420 --> 22:26.930
Jake and see if he has Leslie.

22:32.810 --> 22:34.020
Are you gonna give me a hand,
girl, or what?

22:34.060 --> 22:34.640
What's goin' on?

22:35.520 --> 22:36.890
What's goin' on is that you just

22:36.930 --> 22:39.150
made the biggest mistake of your
life, didn't you copper?

22:39.190 --> 22:40.270
You! Ummh!

22:43.980 --> 22:47.150
How's that? Too tight for ya?
Pig! [punch]

22:49.820 --> 22:50.740
Do it.

22:51.410 --> 22:52.410
Do it!

22:53.910 --> 22:56.160
Aim for the floor.
Keep it away from the bar.

22:57.040 --> 22:58.710
It'll be easier to clean up.

22:59.830 --> 23:00.830
Shoot this cop.

23:01.210 --> 23:02.420
Now!

23:02.460 --> 23:04.800
Before I start to question your
motives too.

23:13.760 --> 23:15.350
Come on!
What's the matter?

23:15.390 --> 23:17.020
Are you crazy?
We can't do this here.

23:17.060 --> 23:18.430
Oh fine. Allow me.

23:18.480 --> 23:21.730
Think about it Taylor. Now's not
the time to be cracking.

23:21.770 --> 23:23.400
Okay, we're too close.

23:23.440 --> 23:25.320
What are you talking about?
What do you expect me to do?

23:25.360 --> 23:26.900
Just let him go?

23:26.940 --> 23:29.110
He's a cop, baby. Look, do you
really want the police back here

23:29.150 --> 23:31.450
-scouring around for DNA?
-No.

23:31.490 --> 23:32.870
Did you think
to check him for a wire?

23:34.240 --> 23:37.290
They can use phone for wires
now. I saw it on TV.

23:37.330 --> 23:39.540
The pigs could be listening
in right now. Okay.

23:39.580 --> 23:41.290
We gotta think straight.

23:42.790 --> 23:44.460
What do you suggest we do then?

23:44.500 --> 23:45.670
You gotta get outa here

23:45.710 --> 23:48.510
before the place is crawling
with pigs, okay?

23:48.550 --> 23:51.510
Go lay low at the motel.
I'll take care of this.

23:52.090 --> 23:53.510
What about you?

23:53.550 --> 23:56.680
Don't worry about me. Save
yourself. Okay? I got this?

23:56.720 --> 23:58.520
What are you gonna do with him?

23:58.560 --> 24:02.150
I know a place that's quiet.
I'll get rid of him there. Okay?

24:04.060 --> 24:07.480
Go on. Okay? I got this. Go on.

24:14.280 --> 24:15.580
Tell me that wasn't close.

24:15.990 --> 24:17.490
Hey b'y?

24:23.620 --> 24:25.170
You smashed a bottle
over my head.

24:25.210 --> 24:26.290
Sorry about that.

24:27.040 --> 24:28.170
Don't worry about it.

24:29.170 --> 24:30.380
I gotta say...

24:31.800 --> 24:33.510
everyone thought you were dead.

24:33.550 --> 24:34.970
I was starting to get a little
worried myself.

24:35.430 --> 24:36.010
I'm fine.

24:37.350 --> 24:38.140
But we've got a bit of
a situation on our hands.

24:39.680 --> 24:42.980
Charlie here nearly blew my
cover and then I barely kept

24:43.020 --> 24:44.650
Taylor from blowing
his head off.

24:45.600 --> 24:47.980
You owe me for this one buddy.

24:49.900 --> 24:51.030
You gotta call this in, okay?

24:51.070 --> 24:52.700
You're in too deep.
This is crazy.

24:52.740 --> 24:53.860
No way.

24:53.910 --> 24:55.660
I'm way too close.

24:55.700 --> 24:57.700
I could have the supplier
by the end of the day.

24:57.740 --> 25:00.370
Your supplier, I'm pretty sure,
is Al Kavanagh, okay?

25:00.410 --> 25:02.250
He's been following me, you,
Taylor, everyone.

25:02.290 --> 25:04.540
Everything connects back to him.

25:04.580 --> 25:06.540
Yeah, Jake. I know that already.

25:06.580 --> 25:07.960
I've been on him for weeks.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.550
You know that?

25:09.590 --> 25:11.840
Yeah. He was tailing me when I
left my car down by the river.

25:11.880 --> 25:13.300
I had to ditch it.

25:13.340 --> 25:15.380
I just need that one last piece
of proof to nail him.

25:15.430 --> 25:16.930
Look, your cover
was almost blown.

25:16.970 --> 25:20.060
I didn't spend four days in
a stinky motel trying to keep

25:20.100 --> 25:21.970
Taylor's grimy hands
off me for nuthin'.

25:22.020 --> 25:23.270
I just need some more time,
okay?

25:24.100 --> 25:25.440
I need you to buy me some,

25:25.480 --> 25:27.770
so I can catch
Kavanagh red handed.

25:38.320 --> 25:40.790
Ah, ladies and gentlemen.

25:40.830 --> 25:44.000
Due to a terrible
case of...

25:44.040 --> 25:45.290
earwigs,

25:45.330 --> 25:47.790
the bar is closed
until further notice. Okay?

25:50.340 --> 25:51.500
Seriously guys,
you gotta go.

25:51.550 --> 25:54.550
Get out -- earwigs, earwigs.
They're bad.

25:54.590 --> 25:58.640
They're gross. No one wants
them. Good. Yes. Thank you.

26:00.640 --> 26:02.020
Earwigs, Desmond?

26:02.060 --> 26:03.850
Hey. Al.

26:03.890 --> 26:05.230
Um, Mr. Kavanagh.

26:05.270 --> 26:07.900
Des, I'm afraid you're not
taking my case seriously.

26:07.940 --> 26:10.360
And this case is
a very serious matter,

26:11.230 --> 26:12.610
you little waste of thought.

26:14.110 --> 26:16.280
What happed with that biker who
was meeting with Taylor?

26:16.320 --> 26:19.490
Who? Charlie Archer?
Oh, he took off on a bike.

26:19.530 --> 26:20.700
I didn't get much on him.

26:20.740 --> 26:24.500
But I heard that he's a plant
for the RNC.

26:25.160 --> 26:26.290
The biker's a cop?

26:26.330 --> 26:27.830
That's what I heard.

26:27.870 --> 26:29.500
I'd love to see the look on
the faces of the crowd of people

26:29.540 --> 26:29.710
he's gonna take down.

26:31.250 --> 26:34.010
Let me know if you hear anything
else out of the ordinary.

26:37.180 --> 26:38.300
He took the bait?

26:38.340 --> 26:40.430
He took the bait.
Hook, line and stinker.

26:40.470 --> 26:43.060
Good. Fill Rose in.
Keep watch outside.

26:43.100 --> 26:44.430
Okay. Yes.

26:54.360 --> 26:56.940
Make sure he goes nowhere.
And talks to nobody.

26:56.990 --> 26:59.030
Now that you're out of the
picture, Kavanagh's gonna have

26:59.070 --> 27:01.030
to do this deal all by himself.

27:01.070 --> 27:02.830
Argh...

27:02.870 --> 27:04.870
You're dead. All of you.

27:05.870 --> 27:06.790
Make sure he doesn't go far.

27:08.120 --> 27:10.170
I need him alive if he's gonna
be any use to me.

27:10.210 --> 27:13.340
You're crazy lady.
I wanna talk to my lawyer!

27:13.380 --> 27:15.960
If you think she's crazy,
you're gonna love us.

27:20.130 --> 27:21.510
Tell me what I want to know.

27:22.220 --> 27:23.640
It's taken care of.

27:25.180 --> 27:26.770
Now that I'm
a full fledged accomplice,

27:26.810 --> 27:28.430
I wants in on your deal.

27:28.480 --> 27:30.690
So she wants in, hmm?

27:32.230 --> 27:34.070
Well that's fair. You did just
save my life after all.

27:35.730 --> 27:39.070
Yeah, I knows this isn't about
Oxy. What's the real deal here?

27:39.110 --> 27:40.240
Wha?

27:40.280 --> 27:42.160
If I'm gonna be your partner,

27:42.200 --> 27:44.120
I wants to know
what I'm getting into.

27:45.200 --> 27:48.160
Me and Oxy is done, okay?

27:48.200 --> 27:50.330
The crowd I got hooked on Oxy?

27:50.370 --> 27:52.710
They're about to meet
the heroin.

27:52.750 --> 27:57.050
Which means more money for us,
more action, the works.

27:57.090 --> 27:58.510
And with Big Charlie gone,

27:59.800 --> 28:01.970
you gotta make the connection
to the supplier.

28:03.050 --> 28:04.930
And then I got
the market cornered.

28:04.970 --> 28:07.100
[ring]

28:09.520 --> 28:10.730
It's Big Charlie's phone.

28:15.820 --> 28:16.650
Yeah.

28:17.230 --> 28:17.440
Where's Charlie?

28:18.690 --> 28:20.900
Charlie can't come
to the phone right now.

28:24.320 --> 28:26.530
Tinny, you got a minute?

28:26.580 --> 28:27.490
What?

28:28.870 --> 28:30.160
Okay, if this is about --

28:30.200 --> 28:32.330
Kevin Crocker's been
talking to Walter.

28:33.120 --> 28:34.040
He's up to something.

28:34.080 --> 28:35.500
Not surprised.

28:37.250 --> 28:40.340
You need to keep your distance.
You don't know him.

28:41.220 --> 28:41.720
That's the point.

28:43.340 --> 28:46.640
Okay. So there's nothing that
I can say to change your mind?

28:46.680 --> 28:48.220
I'm getting to know my father.

28:49.020 --> 28:50.600
And it kinda feels right.

28:50.640 --> 28:53.770
Then I hope that you can
understand when I have to do

28:53.810 --> 28:54.810
is right...

28:56.690 --> 28:58.570
for both of us.

29:02.240 --> 29:04.490
[Malachy] That's not very
helpful, is it Jake?

29:04.530 --> 29:06.410
No, he's not being
very helpful, Dad.

29:06.450 --> 29:08.530
Now you two are hilarious.

29:08.580 --> 29:10.080
We are, aren't we?

29:10.120 --> 29:13.540
No, no, no, no, no. We can't
do that to someone again.

29:13.580 --> 29:14.120
-Why?
-[psst]

29:14.170 --> 29:15.580
-What was that?

29:15.620 --> 29:17.630
Put that down! It'll give him
permanent brain damage.

29:17.670 --> 29:17.790
[psst psst]

29:18.500 --> 29:20.130
You think that scares me?

29:20.170 --> 29:23.050
I dunno. But the last fella who
said that, well let's just say

29:23.090 --> 29:25.130
he isn't saying much
of anything anymore.

29:25.180 --> 29:26.890
-[psst]
-Hey! Knock it off.

29:26.930 --> 29:28.720
-[psst]
-No, can't stop him.

29:30.100 --> 29:32.560
Alright, alright, alright.
I'll bite. I'll bite.

29:32.600 --> 29:34.020
What do you want?

29:37.310 --> 29:39.400
We know the shipment is heroin.

29:39.440 --> 29:41.480
Alright,
so you're not complete dummies.

29:41.530 --> 29:42.900
How'd you figure that one out?

29:42.940 --> 29:45.070
A friend of a friend. Where's
this heroin coming from?

29:46.700 --> 29:48.240
Alright, you know what?

29:48.280 --> 29:52.080
I'm not making enough off this
deal anyway. Kavanagh set it up.

29:52.120 --> 29:54.250
A friend's brining
the shipment in from Montreal.

29:54.290 --> 29:55.410
Where's the drop?

29:55.460 --> 29:56.790
That I don't know.

29:56.830 --> 29:59.250
This whole thing is your deal
and you got no idea

29:59.290 --> 29:59.540
where the drop is?

30:01.000 --> 30:02.420
You know what, I didn't really
want to have to do this.

30:02.460 --> 30:03.800
No, no, no, wait, wait, wait.

30:03.840 --> 30:05.680
Look man,
it's not how he operates.

30:06.800 --> 30:08.260
You a hundred percent
sure of that?

30:08.300 --> 30:10.510
At this point, why would I lie?

30:12.100 --> 30:15.140
You're gonna call him back.
You're gonna be direct, okay?

30:15.180 --> 30:18.020
You're not gonna take no for an
answer. Tell him we're Charlie's

30:18.060 --> 30:19.940
buyers and
the deal's still good.

30:19.980 --> 30:22.570
Since when do you know so much
about brokering deals?

30:22.610 --> 30:25.320
Do you want my life's story
here? Or do you want this guy

30:25.360 --> 30:28.910
to give our dope to somebody
else. Hmm? [ring]

30:29.490 --> 30:30.530
It's ringing.

30:31.280 --> 30:32.700
[Al] Who is this?

30:35.250 --> 30:37.040
We were working
with Charlie Archer.

30:37.080 --> 30:37.920
Were you now?

30:39.420 --> 30:41.630
Seems Charlie had a sudden
change of heart and decided

30:41.670 --> 30:44.090
to pursue a career in law
enforcement,

30:44.130 --> 30:45.300
so we had to let him go.

30:46.420 --> 30:48.970
I see. And who is this
I'm speaking to?

30:49.010 --> 30:50.510
We were Charlie's buyers.

30:50.550 --> 30:53.470
So if you don't want to be left
holding the bag and you're

30:53.510 --> 30:56.850
interested in maybe finishing
this deal, maybe we should have

30:56.890 --> 30:58.100
a friendly chat.

30:58.140 --> 31:00.900
Friendly chats don't
come free, you know.

31:04.820 --> 31:08.070
How friendly do you need us
to be? Extra five?

31:09.530 --> 31:10.990
Ten?

31:11.780 --> 31:13.370
Twenty?

31:17.040 --> 31:18.080
One hour.

31:18.120 --> 31:19.500
I'll find you.

31:26.380 --> 31:28.920
I'm sorry. I couldn't stop her.
She totally wanted it way more.

31:28.970 --> 31:30.050
Don't worry about it son.

31:30.090 --> 31:31.550
Head upstairs.
We'll take care of this.

31:31.590 --> 31:32.930
Someone tell me
what's going on here.

31:32.970 --> 31:34.350
We're having a birthday party.

31:34.390 --> 31:36.430
This is for balloons and we're
just short a stripper,

31:36.470 --> 31:37.770
if you're interested.

31:37.810 --> 31:39.390
Are you Charlie Archer?
Is this Charlie Archer?

31:39.890 --> 31:40.940
Yes it is.

31:40.980 --> 31:42.440
What's going on here Jake?

31:42.480 --> 31:45.400
Just arrest me. I mean,
after what they put me through,

31:45.440 --> 31:46.440
it's all gonna get thrown out
anyway. Do your worst.

31:47.990 --> 31:51.780
It's complicated. Heh, heh, heh.
We should talk in private.

31:51.820 --> 31:53.950
There's nothing to talk about.
You're not a cop.

31:54.910 --> 31:54.950
[Al] Nice place you got here.

31:56.410 --> 32:00.160
Yeah, it's just temporary.
Moving up in the world.

32:00.210 --> 32:01.210
Are you?

32:02.120 --> 32:03.880
Good for you.

32:03.920 --> 32:06.290
Eh! What's up man?

32:06.340 --> 32:09.630
Just checking for wires.
You never can be too careful.

32:20.180 --> 32:21.640
Alright.
Alright.

32:23.730 --> 32:25.190
Where's the money?

32:27.610 --> 32:28.990
Where's the product?

32:33.990 --> 32:35.570
It's all there man.

32:35.620 --> 32:36.990
Even the bonus.

32:37.030 --> 32:39.370
It better be.
Heroin is not cheap.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.710
Where's the drop?

32:45.460 --> 32:47.130
Longitude and latitude.

32:47.170 --> 32:49.590
And you'll find what you're
looking for there.

32:58.010 --> 33:02.100
Kidnapping, torture, unlawful
confinement. Ooh, I can't wait

33:02.140 --> 33:04.190
for my lawyer to hear
about all this.

33:04.230 --> 33:05.150
I've read you your rights.

33:05.190 --> 33:06.730
Embrace the right
to silence part.

33:06.770 --> 33:09.110
Monica, if this has a chance
to talk to his lawyer,

33:09.150 --> 33:11.690
he's gonna jeopardize
Leslie Bennett's safety.

33:11.730 --> 33:13.990
You want me to read you your
rights as well? I'm not gonna

33:14.030 --> 33:15.360
jeopardize anything. Just --

33:15.410 --> 33:18.280
I know you got that blonde
cop in with Taylor.

33:19.030 --> 33:20.870
I won't say anything.

33:20.910 --> 33:23.710
Constable Hayward, you know what
will happen to Leslie if this

33:23.750 --> 33:24.830
information gets out.

33:24.870 --> 33:26.040
Shut up, both of you.

33:27.340 --> 33:31.130
Boys, I'm gonna need some help
over here, ASAP.

33:31.800 --> 33:33.220
What do you expect?

33:33.260 --> 33:35.430
I'm gonna just turn a blind eye
while you torture a man?

33:35.470 --> 33:36.640
I'm calling all this in.

33:36.680 --> 33:38.470
Bennett's little undercover
game is over.

33:38.510 --> 33:40.760
You're ambitious.
I understand that.

33:40.810 --> 33:43.890
But using another officer
to get ahead. It's way off side.

33:43.930 --> 33:45.350
It's over.

33:45.390 --> 33:46.350
[rumbling motorcycles]

33:51.690 --> 33:53.030
Easy fellas.

33:55.820 --> 33:57.570
Well, it's been short,

33:58.620 --> 33:59.950
but memorable.

34:01.030 --> 34:04.370
In the trunk you go.
All of you. Now.

34:04.410 --> 34:06.330
I don't think that's really
gonna -- [thud]

34:07.000 --> 34:08.630
Did you have to do that?

34:08.670 --> 34:11.590
Get in the trunk sporty, or I'm
gonna knock that one out next.

34:17.260 --> 34:20.050
You just better hope I don't get
out anytime soon.

34:21.560 --> 34:22.680
Now!

34:29.480 --> 34:32.360
According to the longs and
the lats, this is the spot.

34:32.400 --> 34:34.780
Yeah? I don't see nudding.

34:36.110 --> 34:38.160
You can text
your girlfriends later.

34:39.070 --> 34:40.030
La.

34:43.830 --> 34:45.000
That better be your hand.

34:45.540 --> 34:46.870
It is my hand.

34:46.910 --> 34:48.870
I'm looking for the shotgun
that's in your trunk.

34:48.920 --> 34:50.790
Don't all cruisers have
a standard shotgun in the trunk?

34:50.830 --> 34:52.170
Stop whatever you're doing.

34:52.210 --> 34:53.840
Look if you've got a better idea
I'd love to hear it.

34:53.880 --> 34:55.840
It should be
right underneath us.

34:55.880 --> 34:57.050
It'd be hard for me to get to.

34:57.090 --> 34:58.890
Okay, I think I got it.

35:01.140 --> 35:02.970
I hope you're not using this as
an opportunity to feel me up.

35:03.010 --> 35:04.560
Please don't flatter yourself.

35:04.600 --> 35:06.600
Although this is totally a move
I would use to feel you up,

35:06.640 --> 35:07.390
I gotta be honest --

35:07.430 --> 35:08.810
Just get us out of here --

35:08.850 --> 35:11.230
and point it in the right
direction -- the gun I mean

35:11.650 --> 35:13.190
-- Jake!

35:13.230 --> 35:15.360
I'm looking for the shells b'y.
I'm looking for the shells.

35:17.820 --> 35:19.410
Alright. Let's do this.

35:20.780 --> 35:24.580
Taylor played you. He played me.
His girl is a cop.

35:25.450 --> 35:26.870
I was told you were the cop.

35:26.910 --> 35:28.370
Yeah well someone's
screwing with you.

35:28.410 --> 35:30.830
Her name is Leslie Bennett.
She collared me in Lab City.

35:30.870 --> 35:32.080
Look it up.

35:32.130 --> 35:35.750
Ahh. I need you to head down
to the underpass.

35:35.800 --> 35:37.010
I'll meet you there.

35:37.050 --> 35:39.510
I'm out. You can deal
with this on your own.

35:39.550 --> 35:41.180
Oh no -- hold on now.

35:41.220 --> 35:45.470
You hold on. I'm out. Our
business relationship is over.

35:45.510 --> 35:46.770
Don't call us. You got me?

35:46.810 --> 35:48.430
No -- Charlie -- I --

35:54.360 --> 35:55.440
Mr. Kavanagh?

35:56.530 --> 35:58.280
Big Charlie isn't a cop.

35:59.030 --> 36:00.070
Desmond, you lied to me.

36:00.820 --> 36:03.160
What? Me lie? No. Never.

36:03.870 --> 36:05.120
Okay. I totally lied.

36:05.160 --> 36:07.080
And I guess this voids
our business arrangement.

36:08.200 --> 36:09.750
My money, Desmond.

36:09.790 --> 36:12.750
Um, I ah,
I kinda gave it to Jake.

36:13.670 --> 36:15.420
Then we have a problem Des --

36:15.460 --> 36:16.800
Do we?

36:17.250 --> 36:18.130
Rose...

36:19.420 --> 36:20.510
Looking ravishing as always.

36:21.380 --> 36:23.300
What do you see in Malachy?

36:23.340 --> 36:25.050
Everything that you're not.
You should leave now.

36:25.890 --> 36:26.720
I was heading out anyways.

36:27.140 --> 36:28.220
Good.

36:31.600 --> 36:33.100
You okay, Des?

36:33.980 --> 36:35.360
I shoulda never taken this case.

36:35.400 --> 36:37.820
All I wanted was to get a handle
on the cleaning today.

36:38.780 --> 36:39.940
[gunshot]

36:41.400 --> 36:43.070
Oh my god, my ears.

36:43.820 --> 36:45.070
What?

36:45.120 --> 36:46.240
Give me that.

36:46.870 --> 36:47.910
Dad are you okay?

36:47.950 --> 36:49.740
Stop yelling! Fine.

36:49.790 --> 36:52.000
Okay we gotta find Leslie.
They'll be after her.

36:52.040 --> 36:54.120
I feel like an idiot. That
bastard got my cell phone.

36:54.170 --> 36:56.080
No. It's brilliant.

36:56.130 --> 36:58.710
Des, I need you
to track a cell phone.

37:06.350 --> 37:08.220
We got a problem.

37:09.720 --> 37:11.890
What the hell man.
We had a deal.

37:11.930 --> 37:15.770
A deal? You really are stunder
than a four year old,

37:15.810 --> 37:17.360
you know that? Your little
missus there is a cop.

37:17.400 --> 37:18.520
Watch your mouth.

37:18.570 --> 37:21.230
Yes b'y.
Her name is Sergeant Bennett.

37:21.280 --> 37:23.360
Royal Newfoundland Constab,
aren't ya?

37:23.400 --> 37:25.530
That's total crap.
That's a fake.

37:26.530 --> 37:28.950
Sergeant Bennett?
You're a cop?

37:28.990 --> 37:30.580
Taylor baby, he's lying, okay?

37:30.620 --> 37:32.700
He's trying to turn you against
me so that he can rip us off.

37:32.750 --> 37:35.500
Oh, I am gonna rip you off.
Make no mistake.

37:35.540 --> 37:37.080
I just wanted to see the look on
his face first.

37:38.210 --> 37:40.710
The big mover
and shaker that he is.

37:40.750 --> 37:42.210
How do I know you're not lying?

37:42.260 --> 37:44.130
I couldn't care less what you
think, you little snot.

37:44.170 --> 37:46.010
Your little game with
the copper her has cost me

37:46.050 --> 37:47.550
the best lieutenant
I've had in years.

37:48.600 --> 37:50.430
It's not gonna
cost me jail time.

37:51.560 --> 37:54.640
The hot cop goes first.
[tires skid]

37:56.270 --> 37:57.190
Ooof.

37:57.650 --> 37:58.610
[crack]

37:59.570 --> 38:00.820
[gunshot]

38:02.860 --> 38:04.030
Stay right where you are.

38:04.070 --> 38:05.450
I got Taylor!
You stay on Kavanagh.

38:05.990 --> 38:06.990
Got it!

38:12.870 --> 38:14.790
This is gonna make up for all
the crap you caused me.

38:15.870 --> 38:18.000
[bullets ricochet.
steady gunfire]

38:22.710 --> 38:24.170
[gunshots ricochets]

38:40.110 --> 38:42.020
[punch] Ooof. [sirens]

38:43.820 --> 38:46.070
[punching]

38:56.710 --> 38:57.830
Alright!

39:04.380 --> 39:06.670
Don't you need evidence
to charge someone?

39:06.720 --> 39:07.920
I never touched those drugs.

39:07.970 --> 39:09.800
You hired Des Courtney
to watch that hotel.

39:09.840 --> 39:11.890
And he bugged it and we got
the whole transaction on tape.

39:13.390 --> 39:15.930
I knows what you're gonna say
Malachy so, you know --

39:15.970 --> 39:17.480
No you don't.
Stay away from my family.

39:18.520 --> 39:20.060
And that includes
Leslie Bennett.

39:20.480 --> 39:22.440
Oh yeah?

39:26.280 --> 39:27.780
The biker got away.

39:27.820 --> 39:29.780
Yeah, something tells me we're
gonna see him again though.

39:29.820 --> 39:33.580
And I got a feeling there'll be
no Duke for you tonight.

39:33.620 --> 39:35.160
Please don't give me
another pep talk

39:35.200 --> 39:36.790
about how
to make babies alright?

39:43.290 --> 39:44.340
[Leslie] I can't believe
you ever thought

39:44.380 --> 39:46.210
I was gonna get naked for you.

39:46.250 --> 39:47.260
[Taylor]
Yeah, you had me fooled.

39:48.300 --> 39:50.630
So, what do you got?
Trafficking?

39:50.680 --> 39:52.510
Possession?
What are the charges?

39:52.550 --> 39:54.510
I'm not worried about
the drug offenses.

39:54.550 --> 39:56.060
I know we got you on those.

39:59.140 --> 40:01.520
Ah, Cassidy --
whatever happened to her?

40:02.770 --> 40:05.730
We found this
in our hotel room. Remember?

40:06.690 --> 40:08.240
That don't prove nothing.

40:08.280 --> 40:10.700
No? How about this?

40:12.450 --> 40:15.740
We found a deep and fatal wound
on the body from a knife.

40:15.780 --> 40:16.830
This one.

40:18.240 --> 40:20.870
Taylor Reginald Gossard,
I'm arresting you for

40:20.910 --> 40:23.460
the murder of Cassidy Sanford.

40:25.880 --> 40:27.420
Katrina Doyle.

40:32.880 --> 40:34.180
Ms Doyle. Please stop.

40:34.220 --> 40:36.300
I'm visiting a prisoner.
Kevin Crocker.

40:36.350 --> 40:37.680
That's not possible.

40:37.720 --> 40:39.220
What do you mean that's not
possible? I'm a cadet.

40:39.270 --> 40:40.270
I want to see him.

40:41.270 --> 40:42.440
I apologies.

40:42.480 --> 40:43.730
But he specifically asked
not to see you.

40:43.770 --> 40:45.360
Excuse me?

40:45.400 --> 40:46.980
I'm sorry.

40:48.110 --> 40:49.030
Let me see the visitor log.

40:56.410 --> 40:58.330
Mom. Unbelievable.

41:02.790 --> 41:03.920
So... Leslie's safe and sound?

41:04.460 --> 41:05.250
That she is.

41:05.790 --> 41:06.170
You know...

41:07.750 --> 41:09.510
it's really nice to see how
worried you were about Leslie.

41:10.920 --> 41:13.050
To care that much about somebody
is pretty revealing.

41:13.090 --> 41:14.130
-Revealing?
-Em hm.

41:14.180 --> 41:15.640
Go home.

41:15.680 --> 41:17.930
Nuttin' wrong with being in love
with somebody that great.

41:17.970 --> 41:19.100
Take it from me.

41:19.140 --> 41:20.140
Jake?

41:21.140 --> 41:22.100
Hi Rose.

41:22.140 --> 41:23.560
Yes! Just leaving and Leslie,

41:23.600 --> 41:25.730
I'm so glad to see made it out
in one piece.

41:26.230 --> 41:27.190
Me too.

41:27.230 --> 41:28.570
Me three.

41:28.610 --> 41:30.530
I just wanted to come by and say
thank you.

41:34.070 --> 41:37.370
Wow. Thank, thank me for what?

41:39.030 --> 41:42.370
This undercover thing was heavy,
dangerous and very tricky.

41:44.000 --> 41:47.590
The wrong people would have
doubted me -- what I was doing.

41:49.040 --> 41:49.550
But you never did.

41:51.130 --> 41:54.590
You just supported me, like a
true friend. And a partner.

41:54.630 --> 41:55.760
Well...

41:58.050 --> 42:01.100
I will say I was pretty worried.
I was sick, actually,

42:01.140 --> 42:03.980
but no matter
what anyone else said,

42:04.020 --> 42:06.230
I knew you were gonna be okay.

42:07.020 --> 42:07.730
I knew I'd see you again.

42:09.270 --> 42:11.650
What did you think would happen
when we saw each other?

42:11.690 --> 42:12.860
This.

42:27.250 --> 42:28.210
Welcome home.
