WEBVTT

00:11.141 --> 00:12.055
What's wrong?

00:12.099 --> 00:13.448
Are the eggs overdone?
I knew it.

00:13.491 --> 00:15.145
I told Mrs. Gunnerson
her flame was too high.

00:15.189 --> 00:17.365
No.
The eggs aren't the problem.

00:17.408 --> 00:20.455
It's this check that I just got
from the Van Kirk family lawyer.

00:21.978 --> 00:24.459
My mother's will
was finally executed.

00:24.502 --> 00:26.678
Wow. I guess
she didn't have time

00:26.722 --> 00:28.158
to cut you out before she died.

00:28.202 --> 00:30.987
No, but she did
leave me this note.

00:31.031 --> 00:34.121
"To my handsome son,
extra security to help

00:34.164 --> 00:36.036
after your inevitable
failure as a writer."

00:36.079 --> 00:39.213
Still charming
from beyond the grave.

00:39.256 --> 00:41.084
Well, she is definitely
looking up

00:41.128 --> 00:42.825
from her rightful place in hell.

00:42.868 --> 00:45.567
You need to show her
how wrong she was.

00:45.610 --> 00:48.178
How great would it be if you
turned in a best seller now?

00:48.222 --> 00:49.527
You got to be close
to done, right?

00:50.789 --> 00:52.400
I mean...

00:52.443 --> 00:54.054
Look, no writer's
really ever done,

00:54.097 --> 00:55.229
but I do have

00:55.272 --> 00:57.970
a draft that's... ready-ish.

00:58.014 --> 00:59.929
And my editor did say that
she wanted to give me notes

00:59.972 --> 01:02.932
before she leaves for vacation,
but, Fallon, I-I-I don't know.

01:02.975 --> 01:05.152
Oh, let me read it first.
I'm great at giving notes.

01:05.195 --> 01:08.590
You know, as long as
it's not a fantasy novel,

01:08.633 --> 01:11.071
or historical fiction,
or a mystery.

01:11.114 --> 01:12.681
I appreciate the offer,

01:12.724 --> 01:15.379
but I don't want you to read it
before it's perfect, and plus,

01:15.423 --> 01:17.686
you're not exactly gentle
when it comes to giving notes.

01:17.729 --> 01:19.688
Oh, I thought you
liked it rough.

01:19.731 --> 01:21.429
Okay, fine.

01:21.472 --> 01:23.126
To be continued.
I have to go now anyway.

01:23.170 --> 01:24.388
Where you off to?

01:24.432 --> 01:26.999
Heroic Hooves.
It's time to talk fundraising

01:27.043 --> 01:29.959
now that poor Patty De Vilbis
has officially stepped aside.

01:39.447 --> 01:41.753
<i>Mm. Someone went on</i> <i>a shopping spree.</i>

01:41.797 --> 01:44.930
Mm. I treated myself.

01:44.974 --> 01:46.236
As you should.

01:46.280 --> 01:48.499
Your face is all over
town and TV.

01:48.543 --> 01:50.719
Between NordicStar
and FSN,

01:50.762 --> 01:52.764
the past six months
have been a whirlwind.

01:52.808 --> 01:55.985
Can you believe I turned down <i>Atlanta Today?</i>

01:56.028 --> 01:58.640
You turning down publicity?
Are you feeling okay?

01:58.683 --> 01:59.815
I'm better than okay.

01:59.858 --> 02:01.991
Local television
is small potatoes,

02:02.034 --> 02:04.602
and I have to leave
some things unsaid

02:04.646 --> 02:07.692
for my interview
next week

02:07.736 --> 02:08.737
in <i>Vanity Fair.</i>

02:08.780 --> 02:11.043
Impressive.

02:11.087 --> 02:13.350
Metaphorical doors
are flying open

02:13.394 --> 02:14.960
since I won
the contract.

02:15.004 --> 02:17.746
Three magazine covers,
billboards both inside

02:17.789 --> 02:19.139
and outside
the perimeter,

02:19.182 --> 02:22.142
and I'm set to be
a guest judge

02:22.185 --> 02:23.795
on <i>Project Runway.</i>

02:23.839 --> 02:26.189
Does this mean there's
no time for spa day?

02:26.233 --> 02:28.191
Unfortunately, no.

02:28.235 --> 02:30.889
I have to meet
a bodyguard later.

02:30.933 --> 02:34.241
Turns out, fame has
brought out some crazies.

02:34.284 --> 02:37.679
FSN security has intercepted
some creepy emails.

02:37.722 --> 02:39.246
Creepy how?

02:39.289 --> 02:41.117
Well, listen to this.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.598
"You're an
undeserving fraud.

02:43.641 --> 02:45.295
"Enjoy your time
in the limelight

02:45.339 --> 02:48.516
"before it gets really dark,
and I take it all away.

02:48.559 --> 02:49.952
Don't turn your back."

02:49.995 --> 02:53.477
Sad, little people,
nothing more. I certainly

02:53.521 --> 02:55.784
don't think I need to be guarded
like I'm the president.

02:55.827 --> 02:58.700
I don't know, that was creepy.

02:58.743 --> 03:00.484
Maybe this isn't the worst idea.

03:02.878 --> 03:04.184
Aren't you supposed
to be opening

03:04.227 --> 03:06.142
a hydroelectric plant
for Morell soon?

03:06.186 --> 03:08.057
Why are you
so focused on this place?

03:08.100 --> 03:09.624
Because I love
this organization,

03:09.667 --> 03:11.147
and I want to do more
with it than just

03:11.191 --> 03:13.497
an after-school riding program
and a rehab center

03:13.541 --> 03:14.846
for retired race horses.

03:14.890 --> 03:17.371
- Yeah? Like what?
- Well, I don't know yet,

03:17.414 --> 03:20.025
but riding was key
in shaping me

03:20.069 --> 03:21.810
into the person
I am today, you know?

03:21.853 --> 03:24.247
It made me disciplined,
gave me confidence.

03:24.291 --> 03:27.119
Well, I think you were born
disciplined and confident.

03:27.163 --> 03:28.599
Well, thank you.

03:28.643 --> 03:30.862
Hey, do you want
to be heroic

03:30.906 --> 03:33.213
and help me out with
a nice, generous donation?

03:34.997 --> 03:38.696
Or maybe I can wait and see
what you do with this place?

03:38.740 --> 03:41.046
Now that Colby Co.'s
back up and running,

03:41.090 --> 03:43.223
I want anything I put
my name on to be big,

03:43.266 --> 03:44.920
and this feels
a little small.

03:44.963 --> 03:46.748
- Hey.
- Hmm?

03:46.791 --> 03:49.968
The only thing small
about this place are the ponies.

03:50.012 --> 03:51.753
But that's fine. We can
come back to this later.

03:51.796 --> 03:53.450
If you don't want
to talk charity,

03:53.494 --> 03:55.104
can we talk about
your personal life?

03:55.147 --> 03:56.584
I really want you
to start dating again.

03:56.627 --> 03:58.760
O-Okay, wait.
How much money do you want?

03:58.803 --> 04:00.283
Because I will pay
any amount

04:00.327 --> 04:02.764
not to talk about my dating life
with you, cousin.

04:02.807 --> 04:03.982
MANDY:Hello.

04:04.026 --> 04:06.463
Ah, Mandy

04:06.507 --> 04:08.422
Von Dunkel, just the person
I was looking for.

04:08.465 --> 04:10.641
Jeff, this is Mandy.
Mandy is a bigwig

04:10.685 --> 04:12.556
on the Heroic Hoovesboard.

04:12.600 --> 04:14.079
It's a real pleasure.
I'm actually doing some business

04:14.123 --> 04:17.169
- with your family.
- So I heard. Good luck.

04:17.213 --> 04:18.606
We're a particular bunch.

04:18.649 --> 04:22.174
Noted. Well, I hate
to meet and run,

04:22.218 --> 04:24.307
but I've got some work to do,
and I'm sure

04:24.351 --> 04:25.613
you two have
plenty to discuss.

04:25.656 --> 04:26.744
So, great to meet you.

04:26.788 --> 04:28.790
- Great to meet you.
- Mandy,

04:28.833 --> 04:31.575
walk with me.

04:35.884 --> 04:37.581
You're certainlychipper,

04:37.625 --> 04:39.496
or are you auditioning
for a remake of <i>Snow White?</i>

04:39.540 --> 04:42.325
What's not to be chipper about?

04:42.369 --> 04:45.633
Sales are soaring,
I'm dating a wonderful woman

04:45.676 --> 04:47.417
who happens to be pregnant
with my nephew,

04:47.461 --> 04:48.984
and I just got

04:49.027 --> 04:50.507
taken off the waitlist
for the newest Rolex.

04:50.551 --> 04:52.466
Well, I hate to burst
your bubble,

04:52.509 --> 04:55.164
Dopey, but some people
have had serious side effects

04:55.207 --> 04:56.470
with your new injectable.

04:56.513 --> 04:57.862
Bruising around
the injection site

04:57.906 --> 04:59.429
is a common occurrence
with injectables.

04:59.473 --> 05:00.996
It's on the packaging.

05:01.039 --> 05:03.303
Consumers on a beauty industry
watchdog site

05:03.346 --> 05:05.957
have reported heart problems,
and now the FDA

05:06.001 --> 05:07.829
- is involved.
- Oh, it's just cranky customers

05:07.872 --> 05:10.179
with unrealistic expectations.
I'm not worried about it.

05:10.222 --> 05:11.702
Well, maybe you should
get worried.

05:11.746 --> 05:13.574
The FDA confiscated
some of the product

05:13.617 --> 05:15.532
this morning and are
testing it tomorrow.

05:15.576 --> 05:16.794
They are not
going to find

05:16.838 --> 05:18.753
anything objectionable,
are they?

05:18.796 --> 05:20.885
The clinical trial adhered

05:20.929 --> 05:23.061
to the highest
possible standard.

05:23.105 --> 05:24.889
I promise,
we have nothing to hide.

05:29.285 --> 05:31.809
I guess I just
needed reassurance.

05:31.853 --> 05:33.811
I've worked so hard to get
this company to where it is,

05:33.855 --> 05:35.683
I can't let
your product ruin it.

05:35.726 --> 05:39.295
Mm, interesting. It's my product
now that the FDA is involved.

05:39.339 --> 05:40.644
I thought we were a team.

05:40.688 --> 05:42.385
Only when
it suits me.

05:42.429 --> 05:44.474
Huh. Hmm.

05:46.998 --> 05:48.348
<i>Every race track</i>

05:48.391 --> 05:50.350
should have a corresponding
Heroic Hooves.

05:50.393 --> 05:52.177
We can start helping
the backstretch workers

05:52.221 --> 05:54.005
and their families,
and that's just the start.

05:54.049 --> 05:56.878
Well, clearly you haven't read
the annual report.

05:56.921 --> 05:58.749
Expansion of that magnitude,

05:58.793 --> 06:00.272
that's not
financially feasible.

06:00.316 --> 06:02.797
I know that, Mandy.
I'm talking big picture here.

06:02.840 --> 06:05.147
Well, the little picture
shows that

06:05.190 --> 06:07.062
Heroic Hooves is in danger
of shutting down

06:07.105 --> 06:08.368
due to lack
of donations.

06:08.411 --> 06:10.021
Well, I'm not surprised.

06:10.065 --> 06:12.023
I mean, that's what you get
when you give so much power

06:12.067 --> 06:13.503
to someone like
Patty De Vilbis.

06:13.547 --> 06:15.157
We should just be grateful
she's gone.

06:15.200 --> 06:17.072
Patty was the one person
keeping the charity afloat.

06:17.115 --> 06:19.030
She wrote a check
every year

06:19.074 --> 06:20.858
for operating expenses.

06:20.902 --> 06:23.078
Of course,
that all stopped now that

06:23.121 --> 06:25.341
she has been cut off
from the De Vilbis fortune.

06:25.385 --> 06:27.125
Maybe it's
just gossip,

06:27.169 --> 06:28.866
but I heard

06:28.910 --> 06:30.999
you had something to do with it.

06:32.522 --> 06:34.568
Well, you know what they say
about gossip.

06:34.611 --> 06:36.221
It's the devil's radio.

06:36.265 --> 06:38.180
So, how much do we need?
You know a Carrington

06:38.223 --> 06:40.182
never leaves home
without her checkbook.

06:40.225 --> 06:42.924
No, a single donor
is a Band-Aid, not an answer.

06:42.967 --> 06:45.448
I didn't like that Patty
was the sole underwriter either.

06:45.492 --> 06:47.885
See, charities aren't meant
to be funded by one person.

06:47.929 --> 06:51.367
You're right. Diversifying
funding sources is a good idea.

06:51.411 --> 06:52.847
Well, I hope for your sake

06:52.890 --> 06:54.501
that the Hooves annual
charity luncheon

06:54.544 --> 06:56.328
later this week will
bring in a lot of money.

06:56.372 --> 06:59.201
- For my sake?
- Well, you're trying to make positive change,

06:59.244 --> 07:00.507
but the old guard

07:00.550 --> 07:02.247
is fine with the status quo,

07:02.291 --> 07:03.684
and they're hard to get excited.

07:03.727 --> 07:06.774
Mandy, if there is one thing
that I know,

07:06.817 --> 07:08.384
it's how to get people excited.

07:08.428 --> 07:09.646
I am going to

07:09.690 --> 07:11.474
shake things up with an event

07:11.518 --> 07:13.998
that will make that luncheon
look like... well, a luncheon.

07:14.042 --> 07:17.611
Mm, bless your heart, Fallon,
but this isn't a crowd

07:17.654 --> 07:20.831
that appreciates anything shaken
but their martinis, okay?

07:20.875 --> 07:23.443
They like their sweet tea cold
and "Amazing Grace" on Sundays.

07:23.486 --> 07:25.880
Well, they better get ready
for Amazing Fallon

07:25.923 --> 07:28.143
because I'm about to
bust out a miracle.

07:52.297 --> 07:53.777
- Hey. How are you?
- Hey.

07:53.821 --> 07:56.519
I'm still a little freaked out
about your mentor's death,

07:56.563 --> 07:57.868
and I barely knew the guy.

07:57.912 --> 07:59.696
Yeah. I'm, uh,
I'm hanging in there.

07:59.740 --> 08:01.611
Cheese?

08:01.655 --> 08:03.395
Humboldt Fog has a way
of making things better.

08:03.439 --> 08:07.138
Actually, I just came out here
to find a quiet place to write.

08:07.182 --> 08:09.227
You know, since the hotel
didn't work out too well.

08:09.271 --> 08:11.621
Right. How's that going?

08:11.665 --> 08:13.797
It's, uh...

08:13.841 --> 08:16.408
You know what?
I-I really don't like talking

08:16.452 --> 08:19.368
about current projects. You mind
if we just change the subject?

08:19.411 --> 08:20.717
No problem.

08:20.761 --> 08:22.371
We can talk about these trolls
on the internet

08:22.414 --> 08:24.242
who have nothing better to do
than complain about the hotel.

08:24.286 --> 08:26.984
Complain about what?
La Mirage is beautiful.

08:27.028 --> 08:29.291
- I mean, the rooms are amazing.
- Our tuna melt is mediocre.

08:30.335 --> 08:32.163
Especially compared
to the Waldorf's, apparently.

08:32.207 --> 08:34.557
Well, I'm sure that's not true.
People online are morons, Sam.

08:34.601 --> 08:36.124
Yes, that's true,

08:36.167 --> 08:38.605
but the Waldorf's sandwich
has an Instagram page.

08:38.648 --> 08:40.171
It's famous.

08:40.215 --> 08:42.217
It makes our tuna melt
look like grilled cheese.

08:44.785 --> 08:46.308
So just make their tuna melt.

08:46.351 --> 08:47.439
Huh?

08:47.483 --> 08:49.485
Hypothetical question.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.705
If no one would ever know,

08:51.748 --> 08:53.445
would you steal

08:53.489 --> 08:56.579
and use the Waldorf's
tuna melt recipe as your own?

08:56.623 --> 08:59.364
Why? Do you have it?

08:59.408 --> 09:02.063
No. No. That's why I said hypothetically.

09:02.106 --> 09:04.500
Well, I think there are only so
many ways to make a tuna melt,

09:04.544 --> 09:05.849
Liam. My chefs
just need

09:05.893 --> 09:08.025
to get a little creative
and make tuna magic.

09:08.069 --> 09:10.506
Okay, what if their
creativity's tapped out?

09:10.550 --> 09:12.421
You know, what if they
have no inspiration,

09:12.464 --> 09:14.336
and using this
new recipe as their own

09:14.379 --> 09:15.598
will get them back
on the right track?

09:15.642 --> 09:18.775
I appreciate your concern,

09:18.819 --> 09:21.082
but we are talking
about a sandwich, right?

09:22.910 --> 09:25.608
Yes. I guess we are.

09:25.652 --> 09:27.828
Too many unsecured entrances.

09:27.871 --> 09:30.657
Too many people
with an alarm code.

09:30.700 --> 09:33.442
I'm gonna need a list
of everyone who has a key.

09:33.485 --> 09:35.618
To be honest with you,
I'm a little shocked that FSN

09:35.662 --> 09:37.402
would take this long
to assign you protection.

09:37.446 --> 09:39.361
I haven't agreed

09:39.404 --> 09:41.189
to this whole
bodyguard plan yet.

09:41.232 --> 09:42.756
How does this
even work?

09:42.799 --> 09:44.932
What if I have a date?
Do you come with me?

09:44.975 --> 09:46.150
Well, do you have a date?

09:46.194 --> 09:48.109
No, but I could.

09:48.152 --> 09:49.676
Well, then I will come with you.

09:49.719 --> 09:52.200
You see, you really don't have
a say in the matter.

09:52.243 --> 09:53.636
This is the network's call.

09:53.680 --> 09:56.204
Because a few Internet lunatics

09:56.247 --> 09:57.988
sent vaguely threatening emails?

09:58.032 --> 10:01.339
No, because if you refuse,
then FSN will suspend you.

10:01.383 --> 10:03.428
Fine.

10:03.472 --> 10:05.779
Here.

10:05.822 --> 10:07.258
A list
of my employees.

10:07.302 --> 10:08.782
Ow!

10:08.825 --> 10:10.958
Ow.
Ow, that's my neck.

10:11.001 --> 10:13.482
This is my assistant. Emerson,

10:13.525 --> 10:14.875
are you okay?

10:14.918 --> 10:17.965
I just... just need
a minute.

10:18.008 --> 10:20.881
I'm sorry. I...
I was just doing my job.

10:20.924 --> 10:22.709
Emerson...

10:22.752 --> 10:24.624
Was able to sneak up
on you in seconds.

10:24.667 --> 10:25.755
What if she had a weapon?

10:25.799 --> 10:27.409
She had a burrito.

10:27.452 --> 10:29.411
Maybe you can
take it down a notch.

10:29.454 --> 10:30.891
That's not in my vocabulary.

10:32.240 --> 10:35.460
This is going to be
a lot of fun for everyone.

10:36.810 --> 10:38.420
I'm in the middle
of a game right now.

10:38.463 --> 10:40.291
Who are you playing?

10:40.335 --> 10:44.034
The only worthy opponent
I've had since Anders died, me.

10:44.078 --> 10:45.601
Listen, I...

10:45.645 --> 10:47.777
I have an actual problem
that I really need your help

10:47.821 --> 10:49.387
with fixing, but you
got to promise me

10:49.431 --> 10:50.911
that you
won't get angry.

10:50.954 --> 10:53.522
Yeah, only a moron would
make that promise. No.

10:53.565 --> 10:57.134
Um, I used an illegal plant

10:57.178 --> 10:59.049
called Bokocho in my injectable,

10:59.093 --> 11:02.313
and, uh, as of this morning,
the FDA is investigating it.

11:02.357 --> 11:05.621
Well, the FDA is an understaffed
government agency.

11:05.665 --> 11:06.883
All right, just
change the plant

11:06.927 --> 11:08.450
before they get to you,
it's a moot point.

11:08.493 --> 11:10.757
Small issue. Uh, I have been
moved to the top of the pile

11:10.800 --> 11:12.672
because apparently,
a handful of people

11:12.715 --> 11:15.805
have, um, suffering some heart
irregularities after using it.

11:17.372 --> 11:19.156
How did this even happen?

11:19.200 --> 11:22.682
Well, anti-aging medicine works
by tightening capillaries,

11:22.725 --> 11:24.771
so in some cases, it can cause
irregular heartbeats.

11:24.814 --> 11:26.729
I don't care about
how your drug works.

11:26.773 --> 11:28.209
How'd you get approval
in the first place?

11:28.252 --> 11:29.645
Oh, I used your FDA contact,

11:29.689 --> 11:31.255
and I omitted some key tests

11:31.299 --> 11:32.735
because, well,
it wasn't moving fast enough,

11:32.779 --> 11:34.171
and I wanted
to hurry it out to market.

11:34.215 --> 11:35.738
You used my contact
without asking me?

11:35.782 --> 11:37.348
What were you thinking?

11:37.392 --> 11:39.350
Well, I didn't think it would be
a problem. I-I omitted

11:39.394 --> 11:40.787
Bokocho from
the ingredients list,

11:40.830 --> 11:42.310
and I called it bee pollen.

11:42.353 --> 11:43.746
No one would've known
anything, except...

11:43.790 --> 11:45.139
Except you're almost
killing people now.

11:45.182 --> 11:46.662
What's gotten into you?

11:46.706 --> 11:49.143
The spotlight's been
on Alexis for months now,

11:49.186 --> 11:50.318
and I'm not getting any credit.

11:50.361 --> 11:52.233
This whole thing

11:52.276 --> 11:54.931
is my idea.
This injectable was my thing,

11:54.975 --> 11:57.455
and I...

11:57.499 --> 11:58.979
I couldn't fail.

11:59.022 --> 12:01.764
Does your mother know
about any of this?

12:01.808 --> 12:03.113
Mm-mm.

12:03.157 --> 12:04.811
Okay,

12:04.854 --> 12:07.422
I will see
what I can do to fix it.

12:09.293 --> 12:10.773
<i>Fashion show,</i>

12:10.817 --> 12:13.471
ladies' lunch, golf outing.

12:13.515 --> 12:15.865
Nope. Boring.
Seriously?

12:15.909 --> 12:17.693
Hey, at least I'm trying.

12:17.737 --> 12:19.608
No wonder fundraising is down.
Who wants to eat

12:19.651 --> 12:22.350
another soggy Chinese chicken
salad and make small talk?

12:22.393 --> 12:25.179
- Not me.
- Do you think this is all a waste of time?

12:25.222 --> 12:28.269
Just HHF, in general?
Is it too small and unimportant?

12:28.312 --> 12:31.054
Look, you're not curing cancer,
but who is?

12:31.098 --> 12:33.796
Scientists? Oncologists?

12:33.840 --> 12:36.712
Whatever. My point is
we all do what we can,

12:36.756 --> 12:38.496
and since you don't have
a medical degree,

12:38.540 --> 12:41.238
right now, it's all about
saving horses and helping kids.

12:41.282 --> 12:42.892
Yeah, yeah, you're right.

12:42.936 --> 12:44.807
We all help the world in
- our own way.
- Mm-hmm.

12:44.851 --> 12:46.417
What's next on your list?

12:46.461 --> 12:48.985
All right, I got, um,
tennis tournament... Mm.

12:49.029 --> 12:51.248
Bike-a-thon.

12:58.647 --> 13:00.823
Hey.

13:02.216 --> 13:06.176
Now that is a great way
to raise some money.

13:06.220 --> 13:08.526
- Male escort business?
- Bachelor auction. What?

13:08.570 --> 13:10.267
Yeah.

13:10.311 --> 13:12.313
That's what I meant.
Bachelor auction.

13:13.705 --> 13:14.750
Did you guys say something?

13:14.794 --> 13:15.795
Mm-mm.

13:15.838 --> 13:17.144
No.

13:18.623 --> 13:21.844
How did you know
I needed something strong?

13:21.888 --> 13:23.715
It's usually
a pretty good assumption.

13:23.759 --> 13:25.543
Well, definitely
a good call for today.

13:25.587 --> 13:27.850
I spent the day
with my publicist

13:27.894 --> 13:29.069
making sure to keep the company

13:29.112 --> 13:30.940
out of the press,
thanks to Adam.

13:30.984 --> 13:32.724
I thought things were good
between you two now.

13:32.768 --> 13:35.249
Oh, we're not fighting,
but the FDA is investigating

13:35.292 --> 13:36.859
his injectable because,

13:36.903 --> 13:38.730
apparently, it's causing
heart issues in some people.

13:38.774 --> 13:41.821
That sounds serious.
What can I do?

13:41.864 --> 13:43.431
Draw me a bath?

13:43.474 --> 13:46.260
I meant more as a businessman,
less as a butler.

13:46.303 --> 13:48.523
Oh, it's fine.

13:48.566 --> 13:52.179
Adam assured me that he did
everything right. I trust him.

13:52.222 --> 13:54.224
Well, I hope
he's telling the truth.

13:54.268 --> 13:56.009
Once a government entity
flags you,

13:56.052 --> 13:58.838
you are under a microscope
for a while.

13:58.881 --> 14:00.840
But my old lawyer's
now chief counsel at the FDA.

14:00.883 --> 14:02.145
Maybe I should call him,

14:02.189 --> 14:03.320
see where this is at.
Just to be safe?

14:03.364 --> 14:06.280
I appreciate
your concern, honey,

14:06.323 --> 14:08.412
but everything is under control.

14:08.456 --> 14:10.240
By the time I get done
with my bath,

14:10.284 --> 14:11.851
maybe it'll be a distant memory.

14:13.853 --> 14:15.071
Does this mean you're
not running it for me?

14:15.115 --> 14:17.857
Indeed it does.Fine.

14:17.900 --> 14:20.990
You're too stingy
with the bubbles anyway.

14:28.302 --> 14:29.564
<i>So, after getting</i>

14:29.607 --> 14:31.348
my PhD in macrobiology,

14:31.392 --> 14:34.786
I decided to study land
organisms in foreign countries.

14:34.830 --> 14:36.353
Brazil, India...

14:36.397 --> 14:39.313
Look, William,
I love that you're smart,

14:39.356 --> 14:41.228
but I am gonna need you
to take off your shirt

14:41.271 --> 14:42.794
because it's
really about

14:42.838 --> 14:44.448
what's on the outside
that counts right now.

14:44.492 --> 14:45.972
So, can you
do that for me?

14:46.015 --> 14:48.583
Oh. Okay.

14:50.541 --> 14:52.369
- Not bad.
- Not good.

14:52.413 --> 14:54.284
Okay, we'll be
in touch.

14:54.328 --> 14:56.112
- Thank you,
- William.

14:59.637 --> 15:01.030
Well, that's not gonna work.

15:01.074 --> 15:03.206
I thought this was about
offering fun dates,

15:03.250 --> 15:04.642
not naked playtime.

15:04.686 --> 15:06.340
No, but we're also selling
the fantasy.

15:06.383 --> 15:07.732
That guy's a scientist.

15:07.776 --> 15:10.257
Nobody was gonna bid
on Gali-lame-o.

15:10.300 --> 15:11.954
Where are all
the hot gays from the gym?

15:11.998 --> 15:13.913
Okay, that's a stereotype,

15:13.956 --> 15:15.653
and they're all too busy
working out

15:15.697 --> 15:17.960
to donate their time
to charity, so...

15:18.004 --> 15:19.962
So, it's true?

15:20.006 --> 15:21.703
That a woman your age
shouldn't be wearing

15:21.746 --> 15:23.966
a white tennis outfit?
Yeah, it's true.

15:24.010 --> 15:26.534
As I was winning my match,

15:26.577 --> 15:27.927
I heard
my good friend

15:27.970 --> 15:29.798
Sassy Jackson
on the next court over

15:29.841 --> 15:32.496
talk about your plan
to hold a bacchanalia

15:32.540 --> 15:34.063
at the Heroic Hooves ballroom.

15:34.107 --> 15:37.762
I am planning to host
a perfectly dignified

15:37.806 --> 15:39.677
bachelor auction,
if that's what you meant.

15:39.721 --> 15:42.115
HHF is not
about sex.

15:42.158 --> 15:44.334
You'll have to find
a new venue.

15:44.378 --> 15:46.684
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
This is not about sex.

15:46.728 --> 15:48.425
Okay? It's just about
people letting loose

15:48.469 --> 15:49.861
and having
a good time,

15:49.905 --> 15:51.385
something you clearly need
a lesson on.

15:51.428 --> 15:54.040
See, this whole enterprise
just proves

15:54.083 --> 15:56.259
how little you understand
about our organization.

15:56.303 --> 15:59.959
Newsflash, Mandy:
I read the annual report--

16:00.002 --> 16:02.396
the last two actually--
and we need money.

16:02.439 --> 16:04.050
So, here is my offer:

16:04.093 --> 16:06.269
back off, and if I don't double

16:06.313 --> 16:09.881
the last two years
of fundraising, I'll step aside.

16:11.187 --> 16:13.102
Well, that's a deal
too good to pass up.

16:14.277 --> 16:17.106
But you'll still have to find
someplace else for your party.

16:20.370 --> 16:23.069
We need more bachelors, ASAP.

16:23.112 --> 16:24.896
Hmm...

16:24.940 --> 16:26.724
I guess it's time
to hit the gym, right?

16:26.768 --> 16:28.117
Yeah, it is.

16:28.161 --> 16:30.859
And bring Culhane, Liam,
and Jeff with you.

16:30.902 --> 16:32.426
If I am gonna
pull this off

16:32.469 --> 16:35.777
in two days, you guys are
gonna be the main attraction.

16:42.697 --> 16:44.307
The competition's tuna melt.

16:44.351 --> 16:46.570
So, you can decide
for yourself.

16:48.181 --> 16:51.097
Mmm. That is delicious.

16:51.140 --> 16:52.663
Okay, so just steal the recipe.

16:52.707 --> 16:54.883
Who's gonna know? I won't tell.

16:54.926 --> 16:56.319
Look, I got bigger fish to fry.

16:57.320 --> 16:58.669
Sorry, couldn't help it.

16:58.713 --> 17:00.323
Well, I haven't sunk low enough

17:00.367 --> 17:02.891
to steal a sandwich recipe,
not that I'd know how.

17:02.934 --> 17:04.240
Why are you
so obsessed with this?

17:04.284 --> 17:05.894
Because I'm just
showing you that people

17:05.937 --> 17:07.069
steal from each other
all the time.

17:07.983 --> 17:09.680
Okay, look, don't you remember
"Blurred Lines"?

17:09.724 --> 17:12.814
Liam, what are you
talking about? I'm not Pharrell.

17:12.857 --> 17:15.730
Can't I just enjoy this
amazing sandwich in peace?

17:17.514 --> 17:18.907
Not until you hear
what I have to say.

17:18.950 --> 17:20.517
Okay.

17:20.561 --> 17:22.476
I found an old manuscript

17:22.519 --> 17:25.044
that Professor Kingston
and I co-wrote,

17:25.087 --> 17:27.089
and I'm thinking about
sending it to my editor.

17:27.133 --> 17:29.265
Okay, why is that
a problem?

17:29.309 --> 17:31.267
Because, technically,

17:31.311 --> 17:33.574
we didn't co-write it.

17:34.836 --> 17:36.142
He wrote it.

17:36.185 --> 17:38.144
Okay, now I'm starting
to understand

17:38.187 --> 17:40.189
the stolen tuna melt obsession.

17:40.233 --> 17:42.887
Listen, if you want
my advice,

17:42.931 --> 17:45.368
I wouldn't ruin my reputation
by plagiarizing

17:45.412 --> 17:48.023
a sandwich recipe,
let alone a book.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.851
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

17:52.027 --> 17:53.594
Can we just forget this
conversation ever happened?

17:55.161 --> 17:56.118
Here.

17:56.162 --> 17:57.685
One bite of this,

17:57.728 --> 17:59.339
and you'll forget
your own name.

18:02.168 --> 18:05.258
Why does Fallon
want us at the club?

18:05.301 --> 18:06.737
And what does she mean
by "rehearsal"?

18:06.781 --> 18:09.436
I'll explain on the way.

18:09.479 --> 18:11.351
Oh, that's gorgeous.

18:11.394 --> 18:13.135
Thank you. I have
a private client

18:13.179 --> 18:14.658
coming in from Paris
next month,

18:14.702 --> 18:16.965
and I want the crème de la crme
to be out peacocking.

18:17.008 --> 18:19.141
Speaking of peacocking,

18:19.185 --> 18:21.230
Fallon's hosting
a bachelor auction

18:21.274 --> 18:22.362
for charity
tomorrow night.

18:22.405 --> 18:24.538
It'll be ridiculous.
We're going.

18:24.581 --> 18:27.454
I'm in. I've been
so focused on work,

18:27.497 --> 18:28.977
I've neglected
my personal life.

18:29.020 --> 18:31.588
And I have cash to burn
for a good cause

18:31.632 --> 18:33.503
- and great abs.
- Hey, hold on.

18:33.547 --> 18:35.766
An event like that
is a security issue,

18:35.810 --> 18:37.246
and with threats
still out there,

18:37.290 --> 18:38.639
I need to bring in more eyes
to keep you safe.

18:38.682 --> 18:41.990
Can you believe
how absurd this is?

18:42.033 --> 18:43.992
I'm sorry
you find your safety absurd.

18:44.035 --> 18:46.212
Do what you need to do.

18:46.255 --> 18:48.214
I need to figure out
what dress says,

18:48.257 --> 18:49.737
"I can take care of myself,

18:49.780 --> 18:51.391
but I still like a man
to pay for dinner."

18:51.434 --> 18:54.655
Make yourself scarce
so I can try on a few things.

18:56.396 --> 18:58.267
He's insufferable.

18:58.311 --> 18:59.921
<i>Five, six,</i>

18:59.964 --> 19:02.358
seven, eight.
No clapping. Walk, walk.

19:02.402 --> 19:04.360
Hips. Hips. Turn.

19:04.404 --> 19:05.970
Come on.
All right, next.

19:06.014 --> 19:07.755
Turn, turn, turn. Hip.

19:07.798 --> 19:09.713
You on your phone. You not
supposed to be on your phone.

19:09.757 --> 19:13.587
Come on, put it away. Pose.
That is not the pose. Stop.

19:13.630 --> 19:15.415
You're making my stomach hurt.

19:15.458 --> 19:17.025
- What?
Okay, you know what?

19:17.068 --> 19:18.635
Joe, why don't you
go take a five.

19:18.679 --> 19:20.594
Okay? You've earned it.
Thank you, Joe.

19:20.637 --> 19:22.335
Everyone say,
"Thank you, Joe."

19:22.378 --> 19:24.075
Fallon, why are we
doing this?

19:24.119 --> 19:26.687
Because Heroic Hooves needs
three times the donations

19:26.730 --> 19:30.038
we normally get so that I can
start my expansion programs.

19:30.081 --> 19:32.736
No, I'm actually talking about
the dance. And where's Jeff?

19:32.780 --> 19:34.738
Well, I just thought the dance
was a super fun opener

19:34.782 --> 19:36.740
to get the crowd excited,
and Jeff

19:36.784 --> 19:39.569
is refusing to participate
because he is doing business

19:39.613 --> 19:41.745
with Mandy's family.

19:41.789 --> 19:43.530
But I want you to know

19:43.573 --> 19:46.533
that I appreciate all of you
for agreeing to participate

19:46.576 --> 19:47.969
and for letting me use the club.

19:48.012 --> 19:49.492
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Can I refuse

19:49.536 --> 19:51.233
on account of I'm in
a relationship with Nina?

19:51.277 --> 19:53.714
No, because I spoke to Nina,
and she's on board.

19:53.757 --> 19:56.107
And the fact that
I am your husband?

19:56.151 --> 19:58.284
Unfortunately, this is one
of those non-negotiables

19:58.327 --> 19:59.720
in a marriage,
but no one

19:59.763 --> 20:01.548
is having sex with anyone, okay?

20:01.591 --> 20:03.680
You're just showing
a lucky bidder

20:03.724 --> 20:05.204
what it's like
to date a rich guy

20:05.247 --> 20:06.944
for a day,
and speaking of, I have

20:06.988 --> 20:09.033
some ideas of what you can
offer up at the auction.

20:09.077 --> 20:11.688
Culhane, a ride
in your Aston Martin

20:11.732 --> 20:13.821
and a visit to
Tiger Mountain Vineyards.

20:13.864 --> 20:16.824
Sam, a private day
of shopping on you

20:16.867 --> 20:19.130
- at Shops of Buckhead.
- Well, with a limit, obviously.

20:19.174 --> 20:20.349
Maybe.

20:20.393 --> 20:22.177
And, Liam, a package

20:22.221 --> 20:24.614
I am calling
"Coffee with the Author."

20:24.658 --> 20:27.704
Uh, it sounds a little more
like a panel than a date.

20:27.748 --> 20:30.229
Oh, perfect, considering
we're still married.

20:30.272 --> 20:31.578
Well, I'm glad

20:31.621 --> 20:33.493
that we're all on the same page.

20:33.536 --> 20:35.364
Okay, we need to get back
to rehearsal. Where's Joe?

20:35.408 --> 20:38.019
I'm pretty sure I just
heard him driving away.

20:38.062 --> 20:40.021
Perfect.

20:40.064 --> 20:42.328
What's going on?

20:42.371 --> 20:44.721
Why are you giving a bag of
needles to this strange woman?

20:44.765 --> 20:47.681
Look, I'm having the injectable
tested in a private lab.

20:47.724 --> 20:50.292
That way, we can get ahead of
any problems the FDA may find.

20:50.336 --> 20:51.946
But I told you
I didn't need your help.

20:51.989 --> 20:53.382
I know, but...

20:53.426 --> 20:54.688
Just because
we are married does not mean

20:54.731 --> 20:56.603
you get to make
decisions for me or my company.

20:56.646 --> 20:58.213
There's no "they" in Alexam.

20:58.257 --> 21:00.476
Well, technically,
Adam is...

21:00.520 --> 21:02.652
Forget that. Look,

21:02.696 --> 21:04.959
if I'm wrong, no harm done,
but if I'm right,

21:05.002 --> 21:06.613
then you'll be ahead
of the problem

21:06.656 --> 21:08.789
and can deal with it from
a place of control, not crisis.

21:08.832 --> 21:10.573
How about I deal
with it right now.

21:10.617 --> 21:12.793
I will take those,
and you can go.

21:14.490 --> 21:17.188
Clearly, you don't trust me
to make smart decisions.

21:17.232 --> 21:19.103
What're you gonna do next? Go
through my credit card charges?

21:19.147 --> 21:20.844
It's not you I don't trust.
It's Adam.

21:20.888 --> 21:23.064
He did frame you
for murder

21:23.107 --> 21:24.674
and let you rot
in jail, remember?

21:24.718 --> 21:27.503
What I remember is that you
told us to go to therapy

21:27.547 --> 21:29.810
to work on our issues,
and we did,

21:29.853 --> 21:31.855
and ever since,
I have been open and honest

21:31.899 --> 21:33.770
and all of this other
therapy mumbo jumbo,

21:33.814 --> 21:36.077
and now you are trying to plant
doubt back into mind.

21:36.120 --> 21:38.209
That's not what I'm trying
to do. I'm looking out for you.

21:38.253 --> 21:40.342
We are in
a partnership now.

21:40.386 --> 21:42.649
If something hurts you,
it hurts me.

21:44.172 --> 21:46.522
Plus, I'm a prominent
figure in the business world...

21:46.566 --> 21:48.089
[scoffs]...and now that
we're married,

21:48.132 --> 21:50.787
your scandal can quickly
become my SEC headache.

21:50.831 --> 21:52.267
Oh, well, I'm sorry
I'm not thinking about

21:52.311 --> 21:54.487
your stupid hedge fund when
I'm focusing on my company.

21:54.530 --> 21:56.837
My "stupid" hedge fund
is as important to me

21:56.880 --> 21:58.578
as Alexam is to you,

21:58.621 --> 22:01.102
but if you really think
that's what this is about,

22:01.145 --> 22:02.799
then you're missing
the point.

22:09.806 --> 22:11.895
Are you sure
you're sure?

22:11.939 --> 22:13.723
Because Fallon can be
very convincing,

22:13.767 --> 22:15.377
and by convincing,
I mean a bit of a bully.

22:15.421 --> 22:18.598
Do you think
I can be bullied?

22:18.641 --> 22:21.383
It's a ride in your car
and a wine tasting.

22:21.427 --> 22:24.604
Though, that sounds kind of
romantic when I say it out loud.

22:24.647 --> 22:25.953
I can back out
right now.

22:25.996 --> 22:27.955
I'm kidding.
It's for charity.

22:27.998 --> 22:30.131
Fine.
The truth is,

22:30.174 --> 22:31.524
I was worried you would think

22:31.567 --> 22:33.787
I wasn't all in
if I agreed to this.

22:33.830 --> 22:36.659
Whoa, whoa, you're all in?
I'm, like, half in.

22:37.878 --> 22:40.533
I got one foot out the door.

22:49.280 --> 22:51.065
Whoa.

22:51.108 --> 22:53.894
That felt like a
"this is serious" kind of kiss.

22:53.937 --> 22:55.678
It was.

22:57.419 --> 22:59.856
Come in.

23:02.424 --> 23:04.034
Shouldn't we be leaving
for the event?

23:04.078 --> 23:06.602
As you can see,
there's been a change of plans.

23:08.430 --> 23:10.127
I'm too sick to go now.

23:10.171 --> 23:11.825
I must've caught
something from you.

23:11.868 --> 23:13.087
I don't have a cold.

23:13.130 --> 23:15.176
Probably because
you gave it to me.

23:15.219 --> 23:16.569
Now, I'm in all night.

23:16.612 --> 23:18.527
Well, I'm sorry
you're gonna have to miss

23:18.571 --> 23:20.529
meeting your future husband,

23:20.573 --> 23:22.749
but it's probably for the best.

23:22.792 --> 23:25.839
And it's probably best
you leave. I need my rest.

23:25.882 --> 23:27.536
No, I'm under
strict instructions

23:27.580 --> 23:29.843
to watch one of FSN's
most valuable assets.

23:29.886 --> 23:31.235
Well, be my guest.

23:31.279 --> 23:33.760
I'm watching a marathon
of <i>The Real Housewives.</i>

23:33.803 --> 23:34.891
You're welcome to join.

23:39.418 --> 23:42.159
Yeah, uh...

23:42.203 --> 23:44.945
Well, since you're gonna
be here all night, um...

23:44.988 --> 23:46.773
I guess I can leave,
but don't go anywhere

23:46.816 --> 23:48.165
and don't answer the door
for anyone.

23:48.209 --> 23:49.515
I'm not moving. Good night.

23:50.777 --> 23:52.561
All right.
Call me if you need me.

23:57.566 --> 23:59.525
Ready?

23:59.568 --> 24:02.310
Almost. I need to make sure
the bodyguard leaves.

24:02.353 --> 24:05.139
He seems like the type to sit
in the car and do crosswords.

24:05.182 --> 24:07.881
I can drive us, but
my car's parked at the manor.

24:07.924 --> 24:10.318
How are we gonna get back there
if he's lingering?

24:10.361 --> 24:12.059
We have to go out the back.

24:12.102 --> 24:14.191
Can you climb down
the fire escape in that dress?

24:14.235 --> 24:15.845
Can you?

24:15.889 --> 24:18.500
We'll have to see.

24:22.417 --> 24:25.072
My FDA contact gave me
the name of the lab director

24:25.115 --> 24:27.466
and the location where
your sample's being tested.

24:27.509 --> 24:28.771
That's great.
That gives us plenty of time

24:28.815 --> 24:29.816
to plan before
the morning.

24:29.859 --> 24:32.166
No. It's happening in two hours.

24:32.209 --> 24:33.472
Apparently, your drug

24:33.515 --> 24:35.386
is such a danger to the public

24:35.430 --> 24:36.649
it's now a high priority.

24:36.692 --> 24:38.389
So what do we do now?

24:38.433 --> 24:39.826
Well, you have
two hours to produce

24:39.869 --> 24:41.305
20 samples that'll test clean.

24:41.349 --> 24:44.483
Look, even if I could
get clean samples,

24:44.526 --> 24:46.354
how do we get into an FDA lab

24:46.397 --> 24:48.182
and-and swap them out
without anyone noticing?

24:48.225 --> 24:50.663
This is why it's important
to have friends in high places.

24:50.706 --> 24:53.361
You worry about the samples,
I'll get us in.

24:54.580 --> 24:56.538
Good evening, everyone.

24:56.582 --> 24:58.366
Thank you all
for coming out tonight.

24:58.409 --> 25:00.934
Dating for a good cause
is fun for everyone.

25:00.977 --> 25:02.979
So is a good old
musical number

25:03.023 --> 25:04.677
to start the night,
and, luckily,

25:04.720 --> 25:05.939
we have both for you.

25:05.982 --> 25:07.723
Come on out, boys.

25:07.767 --> 25:09.899
♪ I'm too sexy for my love

25:09.943 --> 25:15.296

26:00.254 --> 26:04.040
Okay! How great was that?

26:04.084 --> 26:06.086
Well, I thought it was.

26:06.129 --> 26:09.829
Heroic Hooves is a charity
near and dear to my heart.

26:09.872 --> 26:12.135
As somebody who spent their life
around horses,

26:12.179 --> 26:14.268
I know how they deserve
a healthy retirement.

26:14.311 --> 26:16.792
Definitely more than some humans
I know.

26:18.359 --> 26:20.100
Okay. Tough crowd.

26:20.143 --> 26:24.104
Anyway, HHF is the reason
we are all here tonight.

26:24.147 --> 26:25.671
So, let's start
this auction off.

26:25.714 --> 26:28.674
First up we have Cole.
Come on out here, Cole.

26:28.717 --> 26:31.372
There he is.

26:31.415 --> 26:34.462
Cole is the perfect bachelor
with the perfect job,

26:34.505 --> 26:36.638
and I would imagine
perfect abs.

26:36.682 --> 26:38.640
Cole, tell us a little bit
about your date package.

26:38.684 --> 26:40.163
Uh, well,

26:40.207 --> 26:42.252
I'm a "work hard, play hard"
kind of guy,

26:42.296 --> 26:44.951
so my date package is a trip
to the Atlanta Fair,

26:44.994 --> 26:47.170
where you can have all
of the deep-fried cookies

26:47.214 --> 26:49.042
and cotton candy you can handle.

26:49.085 --> 26:52.001
Wow. Okay. Sounds, uh...

26:52.045 --> 26:54.177
Sounds sweet.
Who could say no to that?

26:54.221 --> 26:56.440
Let's start the bidding
at, say, 1,000?

26:56.484 --> 26:58.268
Do I hear 1,000?

26:58.312 --> 27:01.663
1,000 from anyone?
Anyone at all? No.

27:01.707 --> 27:03.099
Well, Cole, it looks like
we have a crowd

27:03.143 --> 27:04.797
with impossibly
high standards.

27:04.840 --> 27:06.625
Is there anything else
you'd like to add?

27:06.668 --> 27:09.584
Uh, yeah, I'm into
doing complex Lego

27:09.628 --> 27:12.065
- and puppetry.
- That's not gonna help.

27:12.108 --> 27:14.284
Um, why don't you flex
for the crowd.

27:14.328 --> 27:15.677
Can you flex for us, Cole?

27:15.721 --> 27:18.941
A normal flex
with your arm.

27:20.595 --> 27:24.251
Mandy, you are a horse's ass.

27:30.213 --> 27:31.693
A Shirley Temple?

27:31.737 --> 27:32.999
She's probably rolling over

27:33.042 --> 27:34.565
in her grave right now.

27:34.609 --> 27:36.698
She would be as appalled
as I am if she were here.

27:36.742 --> 27:38.700
Well, is that why you're
stopping people from bidding,

27:38.744 --> 27:40.310
because you're living
in the 1940s?

27:40.354 --> 27:42.399
It's not because I hate charity.

27:42.443 --> 27:45.185
But between this spectacle
and your gambling,

27:45.228 --> 27:46.839
it doesn't really seem

27:46.882 --> 27:48.623
that you are in it
for the giving back.

27:48.667 --> 27:51.408
I know about that horse race
you and Patty bet on.

27:51.452 --> 27:53.976
That sweet girl loved
this charity.

27:54.020 --> 27:55.325
Now she has nothing.

27:55.369 --> 27:57.719
Wait a minute.
This is all about Patty?

27:57.763 --> 27:59.982
You know, I've been at this
a long time,

28:00.026 --> 28:01.854
and I am not gonna let you
come in here

28:01.897 --> 28:03.377
and upend the system.

28:03.420 --> 28:05.466
Well, maybe the system
needs to be upended.

28:05.509 --> 28:07.903
You are on the verge of
being shut down every year.

28:07.947 --> 28:10.036
Your failure is inevitable.

28:10.079 --> 28:12.908
And when that happens,
I'll take back the reins,

28:12.952 --> 28:16.999
and I will bring Heroic Hooves
back to its traditional ways.

28:17.043 --> 28:18.827
This isn't just
a hobby for me.

28:18.871 --> 28:21.003
I am committed to
making it work.

28:21.047 --> 28:22.831
So if you want to come after me,

28:22.875 --> 28:25.442
you better be ready.

28:39.195 --> 28:41.763
Well, this is inconvenient.
Maybe we should get out of here.

28:41.807 --> 28:43.199
No, we're not going anywhere.
This is happening

28:43.243 --> 28:44.940
exactly the way
it's supposed to.

28:44.984 --> 28:46.855
Okay, but maybe it's not
the best idea

28:46.899 --> 28:49.336
for me to be seen here,
considering that law enforcement

28:49.379 --> 28:51.642
is swarming the place, and I'm
under the FDA microscope.

28:51.686 --> 28:53.340
Yeah, I'd like to be home
playing chess with myself,

28:53.383 --> 28:55.081
but we need to fix this,
and you're the only one

28:55.124 --> 28:57.561
who can identify the Alexam
vials to make the switch.

29:00.477 --> 29:02.915
Building's clear
and will stay that way

29:02.958 --> 29:04.394
for approximately
six minutes.

29:04.438 --> 29:07.049
So get in there,
do your thing and get out.

29:07.093 --> 29:08.834
Thank you, Chief.

29:08.877 --> 29:11.053
Say hello to Bristol and
the kids for me, would you?

29:11.097 --> 29:12.881
Mrs. Gunnerson sends her best

29:12.925 --> 29:16.189
and her strawberry
rhubarb pie.

29:19.888 --> 29:21.324
All right, let's go.

29:30.072 --> 29:33.336
Did I mention Mario also
drives race cars for a living?

29:33.380 --> 29:35.382
Two thousand.

29:35.425 --> 29:37.688
He's cute. Are you sure
you don't want to bid?

29:37.732 --> 29:39.429
I don't like race cars.
Too loud.

29:39.473 --> 29:41.692
Anyone else out there
not afraid of Mandy,

29:41.736 --> 29:43.303
or too drunk to care?

29:43.346 --> 29:45.740
Two thousand is
a good start.

29:45.784 --> 29:48.699
Okay, and apparently
a good finish.

29:48.743 --> 29:50.440
Congratulations,
inebriated lady.

29:50.484 --> 29:52.573
You're gonna have
a great date. Thanks.

29:52.616 --> 29:56.098
All right, let's take
a little five-minute break,

29:56.142 --> 29:58.013
and when we come back,
I'd like to see

29:58.057 --> 30:00.624
some smiling faces
and some attitude adjustments.

30:00.668 --> 30:02.452
It's called generosity, people.

30:04.803 --> 30:06.413
Really?

30:07.631 --> 30:09.024
What are you doing here?

30:09.068 --> 30:10.417
What are you
doing here?

30:10.460 --> 30:12.158
I went back to the loft
to tell you

30:12.201 --> 30:13.724
I tracked down the person
who's sending you

30:13.768 --> 30:15.422
those creepy emails.

30:15.465 --> 30:17.250
It's a woman named Lainie
in Pensacola.

30:17.293 --> 30:19.687
Lainie?
She was the runner-up

30:19.730 --> 30:22.342
for the NordicStar gig.
I knew this wasn't serious.

30:22.385 --> 30:23.778
She's just a bitter loser.

30:23.822 --> 30:25.258
You didn't need to
come here for that.

30:25.301 --> 30:29.349
Well, now that I'm here,
all I see are threats.

30:29.392 --> 30:32.439
And she wasn't the only person
responsible for the emails.

30:33.483 --> 30:35.137
You look like you could
use a drink.

30:35.181 --> 30:37.183
Not while I'm on the job.

30:37.226 --> 30:39.359
Though I could use
a Shirley Temple.

30:39.402 --> 30:40.969
'Cause I love me
some grenadine.

30:41.013 --> 30:43.450
I'm sorry, Cristal, I can't
do this while he's here.

30:43.493 --> 30:47.541
I'm leaving, without a bachelor
and with a bodyguard.

30:47.584 --> 30:49.151
What a disappointing night.

30:49.195 --> 30:51.675
I'm sick. Remember?

30:51.719 --> 30:53.590
Could you politely step off?

31:01.772 --> 31:04.950
Wow, I didn't know
you played piano.

31:04.993 --> 31:07.561
Does it sound like
I play piano?

31:07.604 --> 31:12.044
No, but this is me being
supportive and apologetic.

31:12.087 --> 31:15.221
I'm sorry for doubting
your intentions.

31:15.264 --> 31:18.267
It's been a long time since
I've had a true partner.

31:18.311 --> 31:21.749
Someone I can trust blindly.

31:21.792 --> 31:23.925
Come here.

31:27.886 --> 31:31.193
I don't care about
my hedge fund, Alexis.

31:31.237 --> 31:32.368
I care about you.

31:34.240 --> 31:36.851
You're the most important
thing in my life.

31:36.895 --> 31:39.506
You're the most
important thing in mine.

31:42.857 --> 31:47.035
So, have you given the Adam
situation more thought?

31:47.079 --> 31:50.082
I have.

31:50.125 --> 31:53.737
And I want you
to run the tests.

31:53.781 --> 31:55.739
I'm sure it's nothing,

31:55.783 --> 31:58.960
but you're right;
I need to protect myself.

32:00.527 --> 32:04.487
- I'll call the tech.
- Well, make it quick.

32:04.531 --> 32:07.186
Because I skipped
Fallon's bachelor auction

32:07.229 --> 32:08.927
to spend time with you,

32:08.970 --> 32:11.799
and now you're gonna need to
make it worth my while.

32:11.842 --> 32:14.933
I appreciate the sacrifice,
Mrs. Dexter.

32:25.334 --> 32:27.032
It's not even close to the top.

32:27.075 --> 32:28.294
And you still have to
go out there.

32:28.337 --> 32:29.295
Why are you doing shots?

32:29.338 --> 32:32.037
To loosen up. Cheers!

32:32.080 --> 32:33.516
There's no way I'm gonna
make my goal.

32:33.560 --> 32:36.041
And I told Mandy I would
resign if I didn't.

32:36.084 --> 32:37.259
Shot?

32:38.260 --> 32:40.262
Don't be so negative.

32:40.306 --> 32:42.351
Maybe my date package
will get your numbers up,

32:42.395 --> 32:44.353
'cause I think some people
are really interested.

32:44.397 --> 32:46.312
Can you go away?

32:46.355 --> 32:48.836
Oh!

32:48.879 --> 32:50.142
Feisty.

32:50.185 --> 32:52.492
Don't even bother
with that crowd, okay?

32:52.535 --> 32:54.233
They would much rather be
at a silent auction

32:54.276 --> 32:56.975
sipping room-temperature chard
and bidding on a cheese basket.

32:57.018 --> 32:58.889
Just because you told her
you'd resign

32:58.933 --> 33:00.456
doesn't mean you have to.

33:01.805 --> 33:05.331
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
put your hands together,

33:05.374 --> 33:08.421
well, for me.

33:08.464 --> 33:09.988
For those of you
who don't know me,

33:10.031 --> 33:12.686
I'm Jeff Colby,
founder and CEO of Colby Co.

33:12.729 --> 33:15.689
And I'm here tonight
to support Fallon Carrington.

33:15.732 --> 33:18.213
Hey, this girl is hustling

33:18.257 --> 33:20.476
to make this charity a success.

33:20.520 --> 33:22.522
And okay, okay, maybe
she's not batting

33:22.565 --> 33:25.655
her usual thousand tonight,

33:25.699 --> 33:27.527
but she is trying to make
the world a better place

33:27.570 --> 33:28.876
any way she can.

33:28.919 --> 33:30.791
Which is what I'm here
to do, too.

33:30.834 --> 33:33.489
But it's not a date with me. Sorry.

33:33.533 --> 33:35.839
It's a flight on my private jet

33:35.883 --> 33:38.146
for a week on my private island

33:38.190 --> 33:40.105
with the date of your dreams.

33:40.148 --> 33:42.846
Seven nights of
uninterrupted bliss.

33:42.890 --> 33:44.718
Thirty thousand.

33:44.761 --> 33:46.024
Thirty-five thousand.

33:46.067 --> 33:47.721
Oh, sorry, one more thing.

33:47.764 --> 33:49.418
Starting price is 50,000.

33:49.462 --> 33:51.420
And with 52 weeks in a year,
there is plenty

33:51.464 --> 33:53.118
of bidding to do.

33:53.161 --> 33:55.294
Trust me,
this island is amazing.

33:55.337 --> 33:57.513
- Okay, 50,000 right here.
Yes!

33:57.557 --> 33:59.602
Yes, I see you.
Anyone else?

33:59.646 --> 34:03.215
And remember,
it's all for charity.

34:03.258 --> 34:04.738
So keep the bids coming, huh?

34:08.350 --> 34:10.048
- Thank you.
All right, who else wants in?

34:10.091 --> 34:11.440
Over here!
- You there?

34:11.484 --> 34:12.485
- WOMAN 2: Me, too!
- And you in the back.

34:12.528 --> 34:14.139
What if I only want a date?

34:14.182 --> 34:16.489
I don't actually have
50,000 to spend.

34:16.532 --> 34:18.839
Well, I'm sure whatever
you do have can work.

34:18.882 --> 34:20.449
It's all for charity, right?

34:20.493 --> 34:23.017
I can afford surf and turf
and a bottle of wine.

34:24.018 --> 34:25.106
We can make that happen.

34:25.150 --> 34:26.455
Great.

34:26.499 --> 34:27.761
Private island, private jet.

34:27.804 --> 34:29.980
I'll do 50!
Yes!

34:30.024 --> 34:31.286
- Hmm?
- You are my hero.

34:31.330 --> 34:33.201
Thank you. How can I...Oh. Handle that.

34:33.245 --> 34:35.029
Okay!

34:35.073 --> 34:37.118
Yes. Yes!

34:37.162 --> 34:40.774
Let's hear it.
Now, who's ready for a date

34:40.817 --> 34:44.734
with the author?

34:44.778 --> 34:46.649
One million dollars.

34:46.693 --> 34:48.434
- Sold!
- Get offstage.

35:13.894 --> 35:16.070
Well, would you look at that.

35:16.114 --> 35:18.812
It appears my tawdry
little event

35:18.855 --> 35:21.510
has raised enough money
to save Heroic Hooves and more.

35:21.554 --> 35:22.772
Well, I suppose
when you appeal

35:22.816 --> 35:25.166
to the lowest common denominator.

35:25.210 --> 35:27.255
Mandy, if you have an issue
with the way I do things,

35:27.299 --> 35:30.693
you can leave, and take
your snotty suck-ups with you.

35:30.737 --> 35:33.174
Although, it does look like
they're having a good time.

35:33.218 --> 35:35.394
No offense to your acolytes,

35:35.437 --> 35:38.048
but I think I will be
courting a different crowd

35:38.092 --> 35:40.747
in the future, when I start
my own foundation.

35:40.790 --> 35:43.706
Perfect. What's next,
a wet T-shirt contest?

35:43.750 --> 35:45.317
I'll add it to the list.

35:45.360 --> 35:47.971
I'll be choosing which
organizations to support,

35:48.015 --> 35:49.843
and how to support them.

35:49.886 --> 35:51.497
So while you're at
your next <i>bruncheon</i>

35:51.540 --> 35:53.847
choking on a stale muffin, remember,

35:53.890 --> 35:55.327
I'll be changing the world.

36:00.288 --> 36:03.248
Uh, wow, that was
quite the smackdown.

36:03.291 --> 36:04.597
Look, I'm not saying
she didn't deserve it,

36:04.640 --> 36:05.815
but still, ooh!

36:05.859 --> 36:08.078
Oh, she deserved
much more than that.

36:08.122 --> 36:10.516
I'm sorry if tonight ruined
your business with her family.

36:10.559 --> 36:12.039
Nah, that's okay.

36:12.082 --> 36:13.693
I knew exactly what I was doing
getting up there.

36:13.736 --> 36:15.216
So what made you
change your mind?

36:15.260 --> 36:17.653
I saw Mandy trying to
tear you down earlier.

36:17.697 --> 36:19.873
You stood your ground,

36:19.916 --> 36:21.744
like you always do
when you believe in something.

36:23.529 --> 36:24.878
I should never have
doubted you about this.

36:24.921 --> 36:26.793
I wasn't about to let her win.

36:26.836 --> 36:30.188
And you heard me:
this is just the start.

36:31.232 --> 36:33.234
All clear.

36:33.278 --> 36:35.323
Thank you for racing
back over.

36:35.367 --> 36:37.760
It all happened so quickly.

36:37.804 --> 36:39.762
How did someone even
get on the property?

36:39.806 --> 36:41.329
Changing of the guard is

36:41.373 --> 36:42.722
the most dangerous time
of the day.

36:42.765 --> 36:44.680
I'm confused.
I thought you said

36:44.724 --> 36:46.160
Lainie was in Pensacola.

36:46.204 --> 36:47.640
Well, she is. I mean,
as far as we know.

36:47.683 --> 36:49.946
But I will get to
the bottom of this.

36:49.990 --> 36:51.687
You're in the public eye now.

36:51.731 --> 36:52.949
Crazies come out
of the woodwork.

36:52.993 --> 36:54.777
If you stay on, I promise

36:54.821 --> 36:56.518
there will be no more
sneaking out.

36:56.562 --> 36:59.129
I'm taking these threats
seriously now.

36:59.173 --> 37:00.653
I'm sorry I've been difficult.

37:00.696 --> 37:04.004
I never considered
the dark side of fame.

37:04.047 --> 37:06.441
I'm not a movie star.

37:06.485 --> 37:08.313
Though, yes, I can
look like one.

37:08.356 --> 37:09.923
But really,

37:09.966 --> 37:12.969
I just make clothes.

37:13.013 --> 37:15.798
Well, when you're talented,

37:15.842 --> 37:17.974
it doesn't matter what you do.

37:18.018 --> 37:20.803
Somebody somewhere
will want what you have.

37:30.422 --> 37:32.815
Trust me,

37:32.859 --> 37:35.427
you're not the first
difficult client I've had.

37:40.258 --> 37:42.042
So, uh, I don't know, which...

37:42.085 --> 37:43.391
which <i>Housewives</i>
are we watching?

37:49.876 --> 37:53.575
That was so much better than
a conversation with the author.

37:53.619 --> 37:57.536
Especially now that you're
gonna have a best seller.

37:57.579 --> 38:00.103
I love the optimism, but
you haven't read the book.

38:00.147 --> 38:02.758
That's where you're wrong.
I did read it.

38:02.802 --> 38:05.413
And it's really good.

38:07.197 --> 38:09.417
Wait, you read it?
When-when did you read it?

38:09.461 --> 38:11.680
Okay, only the first
few chapters.

38:11.724 --> 38:14.074
I had a little time to kill
in my glam squad chair earlier.

38:14.117 --> 38:16.511
And I don't want you to
take this the wrong way,

38:16.555 --> 38:18.948
but I was a little worried.

38:18.992 --> 38:20.863
I mean, it just seemed like
you were really struggling

38:20.907 --> 38:22.038
with this one,

38:22.082 --> 38:23.431
and you were being so secretive,

38:23.475 --> 38:25.955
but after reading it...

38:25.999 --> 38:28.088
I mean, wow, Liam,
it was amazing.

38:28.131 --> 38:29.698
Where did you even
come up with the idea?

38:31.483 --> 38:33.180
A writer never tells.

38:33.223 --> 38:36.357
Okay, I think that's
a magician, but whatever.

38:36.401 --> 38:39.752
When this book lands
on the <i>Times'</i> Best Seller list,

38:39.795 --> 38:42.363
you and I are going to
drink champagne

38:42.407 --> 38:45.192
and curse your mother's name.

38:45.235 --> 38:46.846
If you're okay with that.

38:46.889 --> 38:49.065
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, of course.

38:49.109 --> 38:51.416
I'm just, uh, I'm just shocked

38:51.459 --> 38:52.721
that you liked it so much.
I mean, like,

38:52.765 --> 38:54.070
I-I thought it was good.

38:54.114 --> 38:55.768
I just didn't think
it was that good.

38:55.811 --> 38:58.466
Would I spend a million dollars
on just any author?

38:59.511 --> 39:00.990
Only the best.

39:10.173 --> 39:11.436
<i>Great.</i>

39:11.479 --> 39:13.916
Oh, great. Thank you
for the good news.

39:13.960 --> 39:15.265
Did the samples pass?

39:15.309 --> 39:16.745
Oh, no, that was my tailor.

39:16.789 --> 39:18.356
My new suit is
finally ready.

39:18.399 --> 39:21.141
But yeah, I also talked
to my source.

39:21.184 --> 39:24.405
The samples passed.
There's nothing to worry about.

39:26.625 --> 39:28.148
Thank you.

39:28.191 --> 39:30.019
But the less we talk
about this, the better.

39:30.063 --> 39:32.805
And you need to fix your
plant problem immediately.

39:32.848 --> 39:34.937
This watchdog group has you
in their crosshairs now.

39:34.981 --> 39:38.158
Huh. Now I know what it's like

39:38.201 --> 39:40.378
to have you on my side
in a sticky situation.

39:40.421 --> 39:44.425
Well, of course I was
on your side.

39:44.469 --> 39:45.992
I'm your father.

39:49.474 --> 39:51.432
Big news, Sam.

39:51.476 --> 39:52.868
Is this about
the horses again?

39:52.912 --> 39:55.697
Or your new foundation?
Or the network?

39:55.741 --> 39:58.047
Liam turned in his
new book this morning.

39:58.091 --> 40:01.921
Oh. That is big news.

40:01.964 --> 40:04.880
And frankly,
I would be shocked

40:04.924 --> 40:06.491
if anyone had a single note.

40:06.534 --> 40:07.883
Everyone gets notes.

40:07.927 --> 40:09.363
Well, maybe Liam will get lucky

40:09.407 --> 40:10.973
and get off scot-free.

40:11.017 --> 40:12.497
Fingers crossed.

40:13.541 --> 40:16.065
Ew, is there even champagne
in these mimosas?

40:16.109 --> 40:18.241
I knew they looked weird.
Jeanette!

40:19.721 --> 40:20.896
You turned it in?

40:20.940 --> 40:22.071
Put yourself in my shoes.

40:22.115 --> 40:23.464
Okay, yeah, sure,
it's easy to say

40:23.508 --> 40:25.205
you'd do the right thing,

40:25.248 --> 40:27.337
but trust me, when your wife
is looking in your eyes

40:27.381 --> 40:28.861
and calling you a genius,
it's just as easy

40:28.904 --> 40:30.036
to do the wrong thing.

40:30.079 --> 40:31.994
Oh, she thinks
you're a genius?

40:32.038 --> 40:33.518
For turning in a book
you didn't write?

40:33.561 --> 40:34.736
I did some edits.

40:34.780 --> 40:36.390
I took a pass
at a few chapters.

40:36.434 --> 40:37.826
Oh, and by the way,
I saw you put the tuna melt

40:37.870 --> 40:40.699
- back on the menu.
- Yes, I did.

40:40.742 --> 40:42.788
But I didn't steal it.

40:42.831 --> 40:44.833
I hired a new chef
and figured out a way

40:44.877 --> 40:47.183
to make it my own.

40:47.227 --> 40:50.186
Because that is a solution
I can live with.

40:50.230 --> 40:51.666
Hope you can live with yours.

40:55.365 --> 40:57.063
Glad to see you're
already drinking.

40:57.106 --> 40:59.239
Maybe it'll take the sting
out of what I'm about to say.

40:59.282 --> 41:01.328
I know you lied to me.

41:01.371 --> 41:02.416
I know you put
our partnership,

41:02.460 --> 41:03.417
our company and our reputation

41:03.461 --> 41:04.723
on the line.

41:04.766 --> 41:07.073
Oh, Mother,
don't worry about it.

41:07.116 --> 41:09.075
It's been handled.
Tell her, Father.

41:09.118 --> 41:10.990
I got your company
out of trouble,

41:11.033 --> 41:12.818
so you can thank me by leaving.

41:12.861 --> 41:15.908
I am not worried,
and I am not thanking you.

41:15.951 --> 41:17.779
I handled my own business.

41:17.823 --> 41:19.302
Come in!

41:21.391 --> 41:23.089
Mother, what did you do?

41:23.132 --> 41:24.786
These agents are from the DEA.

41:24.830 --> 41:27.572
When I did my own testing
and discovered you were

41:27.615 --> 41:30.139
importing and using
an illegal drug,

41:30.183 --> 41:31.489
I called the authorities.

41:32.620 --> 41:34.579
I can't believe you'd do this.

41:34.622 --> 41:35.710
We're partners.

41:35.754 --> 41:38.147
No, we are definitely not partners.

41:38.191 --> 41:40.323
I couldn't trust you not
to turn on me again.

41:40.367 --> 41:42.456
Frame me for murder once,
shame on me.

41:42.500 --> 41:43.805
Frame me again?

41:43.849 --> 41:46.068
Father, wha--

41:46.112 --> 41:48.549
You're gonna--
You're gonna fix this, right?

41:48.593 --> 41:51.987
I'll do what I can,
but I can't promise anything.
