00:13.013 --> 00:15.683
ANNOUNCER:
FX presents Better Things.

00:18.819 --> 00:21.589
* Mother *

00:21.622 --> 00:24.024
* You had me *

00:24.058 --> 00:26.760
* But I never had you *

00:28.896 --> 00:30.698
*

00:32.966 --> 00:36.837
* I wanted you *

00:38.439 --> 00:41.509
* You didn't want me. *

00:43.477 --> 00:45.613
*

00:55.289 --> 00:56.524
What is this?

00:56.557 --> 00:58.426
It's a list.

00:58.459 --> 01:00.494
Hmm. Why do we each have one?

01:00.528 --> 01:02.630
Because this
is important,

01:02.663 --> 01:05.299
and I thought it all out,
and I, like, organized it.

01:05.333 --> 01:07.301
Okay, so,
you want us to,

01:07.335 --> 01:09.403
like, read from this list,
or...?

01:09.437 --> 01:11.805
Yeah.
Okay.

01:11.839 --> 01:14.742
And just please, like,
don't say anything

01:14.775 --> 01:17.478
until I go through each thing,
okay?

01:17.511 --> 01:19.247
We'll see.

01:19.280 --> 01:21.515
Mom.
Okay.

01:21.549 --> 01:24.185
Go. I'm shtum.
Okay.

01:24.218 --> 01:25.986
You have the floor.

01:26.019 --> 01:27.355
Okay.
Okay.

01:27.388 --> 01:29.557
This is what I want.

01:29.590 --> 01:31.192
Number one:
I want

01:31.225 --> 01:32.793
a keg of beer.
Ugh!

01:32.826 --> 01:36.164
I know. I know we're
underage, but I want a keg.

01:36.197 --> 01:38.031
It's a keg of beer.
Paisley had one.

01:38.065 --> 01:40.834
Design had a one,
Adam had two kegs.

01:40.868 --> 01:42.436
Mom, just text

01:42.470 --> 01:43.904
Pais's mom
and ask her what she did.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.273
(sighs)
We're adults now, Mom.

01:45.306 --> 01:46.707
(whispering):
We're adults now.

01:46.740 --> 01:48.376
Number two:

01:48.409 --> 01:49.910
I want a DJ.

01:49.943 --> 01:51.379
And I don't want one
of your stupid friends

01:51.412 --> 01:52.780
to, like,
plug his iPod

01:52.813 --> 01:54.415
into the stereo.

01:54.448 --> 01:57.451
I want a DJ with turntables
and, like, the stuff.

01:59.420 --> 02:00.854
A real DJ.

02:00.888 --> 02:02.390
Number three:

02:02.423 --> 02:04.225
I want tacos and an
ice cream station

02:04.258 --> 02:07.495
with sauces and Heath bar pieces
and all of that.

02:07.528 --> 02:09.129
Number four: I want...

02:09.163 --> 02:11.199
Okay, tacos is a go.

02:11.232 --> 02:13.601
There is one more.
Okay. Ice cream, check.

02:13.634 --> 02:15.603
DJ, check.

02:15.636 --> 02:17.538
Mom, there was one more.

02:17.571 --> 02:21.008
(sighs)
Max, you're not gonna have
a keg of beer in my house.

02:21.041 --> 02:24.077
But if I don't have a keg,

02:24.111 --> 02:26.247
or you don't, then
kids are gonna go out

02:26.280 --> 02:28.382
and buy beer illegally
and, like, bring it in.

02:28.416 --> 02:29.783
Okay.

02:29.817 --> 02:31.419
That's fine with me.

02:31.452 --> 02:34.154
Okay, if I have a keg,
and I'm serving a keg

02:34.188 --> 02:35.589
to, like, 18-year-olds,

02:35.623 --> 02:38.326
17, 18-year-olds,
then I go to jail.

02:38.359 --> 02:41.028
But if a bunch
of people bring, from

02:41.061 --> 02:42.663
I don't know where,

02:42.696 --> 02:44.865
that's each of their parents'
separate problems, okay?

02:44.898 --> 02:47.268
(sighs)

02:47.301 --> 02:49.002
What about the last thing?

02:49.036 --> 02:50.504
I'm not

02:50.538 --> 02:52.540
discussing that.
No!

02:52.573 --> 02:54.642
You're ignoring.
Read it out!
No.

02:54.675 --> 02:56.009
No, Max,
I'm not addressing that.

02:56.043 --> 02:58.846
No.
You don't have
to be here, Mom.

02:58.879 --> 03:02.483
I'm going
to your graduation party, okay?

03:02.516 --> 03:04.318
I'm really looking forward
to it.

03:04.352 --> 03:05.986
I'm excited.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.755
And maybe even

03:07.788 --> 03:09.823
I may meet a boy there.

03:09.857 --> 03:12.125
Ugh!
Max,

03:12.159 --> 03:14.628
the last time you had a party
and I wasn't here,

03:14.662 --> 03:16.530
somebody blew smoke
in Frankie's face,

03:16.564 --> 03:18.799
and there was a hookah burn
on the couch.

03:18.832 --> 03:20.768
You want
to know why I know

03:20.801 --> 03:22.303
there was a hookah?

03:22.336 --> 03:24.972
Because someone showed me
the Facebook photos

03:25.005 --> 03:26.640
before you deleted them.

03:26.674 --> 03:28.175
Yes, that's right.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.877
I'm coming to your party.

03:29.910 --> 03:31.812
And I'm gonna go ahead and say

03:31.845 --> 03:34.715
that it hurts my feelings
that you don't want me there.

03:34.748 --> 03:36.884
This isn't about you.

03:36.917 --> 03:39.086
I'm not saying
that it is.

03:39.119 --> 03:40.921
Yeah, you just did.

03:40.954 --> 03:43.190
Mom, just please

03:43.223 --> 03:44.692
just listen to me.

03:44.725 --> 03:47.895
Like, just take a breath
and listen.

03:47.928 --> 03:49.363
(exhales loudly)

03:49.397 --> 03:52.500
I'm listening.
I'm listening.

03:52.533 --> 03:54.602
Okay.

03:54.635 --> 03:58.071
This party is about me
and my friends,

03:58.105 --> 04:00.374
and, like,
I'm-I'm asking for this.

04:00.408 --> 04:02.676
And I know it seems like I'm
demanding, because I'm, like...

04:02.710 --> 04:05.879
I'm afraid you'll say no
so I'm trying to....

04:05.913 --> 04:07.748
Like, I-I get it.
It's your house.

04:07.781 --> 04:10.518
You don't have to do
it, but just please

04:10.551 --> 04:12.520
let me have this.

04:12.553 --> 04:14.087
No keg. Fine.

04:14.121 --> 04:16.023
Like, I'm not trying
to hurt your feelings.

04:16.056 --> 04:19.059
Just... thank you
for the food and the DJ.

04:19.092 --> 04:21.762
Please don't be here.

04:23.263 --> 04:24.798
And there's one more thing.

04:24.832 --> 04:26.400
It's not about the party.

04:26.434 --> 04:28.201
I don't know, Max.

04:28.235 --> 04:31.071
I'm kind of tapped out
right now. What is it?

04:31.104 --> 04:32.773
Well, I talked to my dad.

04:32.806 --> 04:35.776
You know,
he's coming to my graduation.

04:35.809 --> 04:38.412
Oh.

04:38.446 --> 04:41.114
Did he tell you?

04:41.148 --> 04:43.584
What... what did...
(sighs)

04:43.617 --> 04:45.853
Tell me what you need.

04:45.886 --> 04:48.255
Okay, well, uh,
my dad and I planned

04:48.288 --> 04:50.223
that I was just
gonna get dressed here,

04:50.257 --> 04:52.125
and then,
he was gonna pick me up,

04:52.159 --> 04:54.094
and take me
to graduation rehearsal,

04:54.127 --> 04:56.263
and then we were gonna
go get something to eat

04:56.296 --> 04:58.131
before the ceremony,
and then he was gonna

04:58.165 --> 05:01.402
drop me off here with you guys
for the family thing after.

05:01.435 --> 05:03.236
You guys planned this?

05:03.270 --> 05:04.972
I mean, yeah,
well, I mean,

05:05.005 --> 05:06.474
I know you were gonna do it,

05:06.507 --> 05:07.975
but, like,
now you don't have to.

05:08.008 --> 05:09.343
Is there
any other things

05:09.377 --> 05:11.579
you would like me to not do?

05:11.612 --> 05:14.415
Would you like me
to vanish into thin air,

05:14.448 --> 05:17.351
but still pay for everything?

05:17.385 --> 05:20.454
Mom.

05:20.488 --> 05:23.123
(sighs)

05:23.156 --> 05:24.958
Okay, baby. I'm sorry.

05:24.992 --> 05:26.494
Just come here.

05:27.728 --> 05:30.163
Come here.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.301
I love you.

05:36.537 --> 05:38.439
It's whatever you want.

05:38.472 --> 05:40.641
It's your big day.

05:40.674 --> 05:43.544
No keg, no drugs.

05:43.577 --> 05:46.279
I'll be across the street
at Gran's.

05:46.313 --> 05:48.582
Your dad can take you.

05:48.616 --> 05:51.184
I love you.

05:51.218 --> 05:53.987
It's whatever you want.

05:54.021 --> 05:55.756
No keg.

05:55.789 --> 05:57.190
No me.

05:58.826 --> 06:01.194
Thanks.

06:01.228 --> 06:02.630
I love you.

06:02.663 --> 06:04.898
Okay.

06:10.504 --> 06:12.906
(sighing):
Ooh.

06:21.114 --> 06:23.116
(dance music playing,
chatter and laughter)

06:25.753 --> 06:27.154
Oh!

06:27.187 --> 06:29.557
(indistinct chatter)

06:32.192 --> 06:36.096
Mom, do you remember
my high school graduation?

06:36.129 --> 06:38.198
No.

06:43.571 --> 06:45.205
Friends.
Hi.

06:45.238 --> 06:47.541
Max. Hi.

06:47.575 --> 06:49.543
Mom, those are grown men.

06:49.577 --> 06:52.079
Those are fully-grown men.

06:52.112 --> 06:55.082
Well... she's
grown-up now.

06:55.115 --> 06:57.384
She'll probably
be pregnant soon.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.419
(inhaling)

06:59.453 --> 07:01.455
(indistinct chatter,
dance music playing)

07:03.524 --> 07:06.426
(quietly):
Mom, get low. She's looking!

07:06.460 --> 07:09.563
PHYLLIS:
So how are you going to do this?

07:09.597 --> 07:13.133
Tomorrow's the big day, and your
place is going to be a wreck.

07:23.944 --> 07:27.280
(low growling)

07:27.314 --> 07:28.782
(barks)

07:28.816 --> 07:31.251
(Sam groans softly)

07:39.392 --> 07:41.762
(whirring)

07:57.978 --> 07:59.947
Max?

07:59.980 --> 08:02.315
Come on.

08:02.349 --> 08:05.318
Wakey, wakey!

08:05.352 --> 08:06.754
Come on.

08:06.787 --> 08:08.321
Oh, my God.

08:08.355 --> 08:10.490
(sniffles)

08:10.524 --> 08:12.492
Yeah!

08:12.526 --> 08:14.261
What time is it?

08:14.294 --> 08:16.229
It's 11:00.

08:16.263 --> 08:18.431
People start
arriving at 2:00.

08:18.465 --> 08:19.667
(groaning):
Oh!

08:19.700 --> 08:21.702
Drink this

08:21.735 --> 08:23.236
and eat this onion.

08:23.270 --> 08:25.505
You got to start
waking up.

08:25.539 --> 08:28.208
I have to eat this onion?

08:28.241 --> 08:32.412
Honey, your mom knows.

08:32.445 --> 08:35.148
It's time for you
to learn these secrets.

08:35.182 --> 08:37.284
Drink this down first.

08:37.317 --> 08:38.986
Quick.

08:43.991 --> 08:46.459
Good.

08:46.493 --> 08:49.329
Now bite down
into this.

08:49.362 --> 08:51.264
Serious.

09:02.142 --> 09:04.011
Oh, my God! (coughs)

09:04.044 --> 09:05.813
How does this help?

09:05.846 --> 09:08.515
It doesn't. Ha!

09:09.883 --> 09:12.185
Oh, my God! Mom!

09:13.921 --> 09:16.423
But you should rub it
on your feet.

09:16.456 --> 09:18.458
Really?

09:21.561 --> 09:24.732
(doorbell rings)
SAM (in distance):
Frankie, get that.

09:24.765 --> 09:26.734
(doorbell rings)

09:26.767 --> 09:28.368
Frankie,
get that!

09:28.401 --> 09:29.837
Right there.

09:29.870 --> 09:32.305
Frankie, why are you
ignoring me?

09:32.339 --> 09:34.307
Because you're yelling.

09:34.341 --> 09:35.643
(doorbell rings)

09:35.676 --> 09:37.110
Oh. The doorbell
is ringing.

09:37.144 --> 09:40.013
I'll get it.

09:40.047 --> 09:41.414
Mmm...
I know.

09:41.448 --> 09:43.583
Mm-mmm.
I know. Don't do it.

09:43.617 --> 09:46.186
Not cute. Murder.
Mm-hmm.

09:46.219 --> 09:47.554
Murder most foul.
Mm-hmm.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.089
Mm-hmm.
It's illegal.

09:49.122 --> 09:50.924
Yeah, I like the ones
I got. Aren't they cute?

09:50.958 --> 09:53.026
And they match your dress.
That's very coordinated.

09:53.060 --> 09:55.428
Yeah, and they
smell really good.
Oh, they do smell really good.

09:55.462 --> 09:57.097
It's your graduation!
MAX: I love it.

09:57.130 --> 09:58.932
My dad's coming at 4:00,
he's picking me up

09:58.966 --> 10:00.267
and taking me to rehearsal.
Oh, that's great.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.169
Max, honey,

10:02.202 --> 10:03.737
you got to go get dressed.
MAX: And he
didn't tell me

10:03.771 --> 10:05.172
where we're going
for lunch, 'cause he's

10:05.205 --> 10:06.573
being all secretive about it!

10:06.606 --> 10:08.441
Oh, fun.

10:08.475 --> 10:10.543
Hmm.

10:10.577 --> 10:11.544
(knocking)

10:11.578 --> 10:13.080
MAN: Hello?
(gasps)

10:13.113 --> 10:15.115
Hello?

10:15.148 --> 10:16.616
Bro. Bro.

10:16.650 --> 10:17.918
Hi, sis.
(laughs)

10:17.951 --> 10:19.552
Thank you for coming.
Yes.

10:19.586 --> 10:22.289
Oh, what? Oh,

10:22.322 --> 10:23.523
you're still hugging.
Oh, sorry.

10:23.556 --> 10:24.925
Okay.
Sorry.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.259
Bro.

10:26.293 --> 10:27.560
That was nice.

10:27.594 --> 10:29.262
Yeah, I guess I missed you.

10:29.296 --> 10:31.064
Wait. Oh, my God.

10:31.098 --> 10:32.565
What, are you crying?

10:32.599 --> 10:34.367
Shut up.
Stop it. Gross.

10:34.401 --> 10:36.436
Hi, Dormin.
Hey.

10:36.469 --> 10:39.239
Okay. Biggest Jew
in the world at 19.

10:39.272 --> 10:41.474
Hi.
Come to your auntie.

10:41.508 --> 10:43.143
How are you?

10:43.176 --> 10:44.477
I'm good, I'm good.

10:44.511 --> 10:46.113
Um, it's my first year
at Stanford.

10:46.146 --> 10:48.081
So it's...
a bit of an adjustment.

10:48.115 --> 10:49.482
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.

10:49.516 --> 10:50.650
Impressive.

10:50.684 --> 10:52.886
Dormin! Oh, thanks for coming.

10:52.920 --> 10:54.755
Yeah. So good to see you.

10:54.788 --> 10:56.256
Good to see you too.

10:56.289 --> 10:58.025
DORMIN:
Yeah.

10:58.058 --> 11:00.293
Hi, Marion, how are you?
Hey, sweetie.

11:00.327 --> 11:01.895
Hi.
Good to see you.

11:01.929 --> 11:03.864
Good to see you.
Here's your present.

11:03.897 --> 11:06.333
Oh, thank you.
It's a... a treasury bond.

11:06.366 --> 11:08.035
Doesn't mature till 2031.

11:08.068 --> 11:10.437
I figure by then
you might be in some trouble.

11:10.470 --> 11:12.272
Why? Is that the year
I'm gonna die?

11:12.305 --> 11:13.974
(laughs)
No.

11:14.007 --> 11:15.943
That year she's set.
She'll have your money.

11:15.976 --> 11:17.310
(chortles)

11:17.344 --> 11:18.511
Please tell me
you didn't invite Rich.

11:18.545 --> 11:20.080
No, I didn't.
Shit, Rich!

11:20.113 --> 11:22.382
How are you, Marion?
Buddy. What are you,
grabbing my ass?

11:22.415 --> 11:24.151
A little bit.
All right.

11:25.185 --> 11:26.453
Mom.

11:26.486 --> 11:29.056
Hello, Marion.

11:31.624 --> 11:33.026
Mom. Hi.

11:33.060 --> 11:34.795
Hello.

11:37.030 --> 11:38.531
Mom.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.270
I'm here.
Yes, I see that.

11:43.303 --> 11:46.373
Hey! (starts vocalizing
"Another Op'nin', Another Show")

11:52.980 --> 11:55.648
Hi!

11:55.682 --> 11:58.518
Is that Tressa? Hi.
Hello, gorgeous.

11:58.551 --> 12:01.054
My dad's coming at 4:00.
He's taking me to graduation.

12:01.088 --> 12:02.722
Mmm, won't that be nice?

12:02.756 --> 12:04.657
Hi!
Hey, hey.

12:04.691 --> 12:06.393
Hi
Hi, I'm Marion,

12:06.426 --> 12:07.828
Sam's brother.
Hi. Jeff.

12:07.861 --> 12:09.863
I'm Sunny's ex-husband.

12:09.897 --> 12:11.231
Hey.

12:13.200 --> 12:14.567
Sunny!
Hello!

12:14.601 --> 12:16.569
Jesus, you look great.
Oh, thank you.

12:16.603 --> 12:19.672
How did you get through a whole
husband since I saw you?

12:19.706 --> 12:21.909
'Cause you're never here,
asshole. What, am I supposed

12:21.942 --> 12:24.244
to go to Dallas to visit
my best friend's brother?

12:24.277 --> 12:26.579
No.
Come visit.

12:26.613 --> 12:29.249
Oh.
Cheers.
(indistinct conversations)

12:29.282 --> 12:30.483
SAM:
Max, honey,

12:30.517 --> 12:32.052
do you want to go get ready?

12:32.085 --> 12:33.921
Oh, what time is it?
It's, like,
almost 3:00.

12:33.954 --> 12:36.389
Oh! Oh, we have to go.
(gasps) Come on.

12:36.423 --> 12:37.724
Go get makeups!

12:37.757 --> 12:39.059
Oh, yeah.
Yes, thank you.

12:39.092 --> 12:41.261
Here you go,
honey.
To you!

12:41.294 --> 12:43.530
Hey!
TRESSA: Hey! Now we drink.

12:43.563 --> 12:45.598
Poi... Po-po-po...

12:45.632 --> 12:46.934
You like that?
It looks great.
Thank you.

12:46.967 --> 12:48.902
That... I haven't
finished.

12:48.936 --> 12:50.037
Lean in, please.

12:50.070 --> 12:52.739
Thank you,
dear.

12:52.772 --> 12:54.474
Can't believe it.

12:54.507 --> 12:56.743
I can.

12:56.776 --> 13:00.380
Really? It didn't
all go by so fast?

13:00.413 --> 13:01.781
No.

13:01.815 --> 13:03.851
It all went by really slow.

13:03.884 --> 13:06.019
And it's not over.

13:06.053 --> 13:08.288
I mean, what, do you think--
she's gonna move out tomorrow?

13:08.321 --> 13:10.723
Plus she's not even 18 yet.

13:10.757 --> 13:12.759
Also, she's a dum-dum.

13:12.792 --> 13:15.162
*

13:17.931 --> 13:20.934
* Magic moment... *

13:21.969 --> 13:24.337
(gasps)
Max, baby,

13:24.371 --> 13:25.805
you look
so beautiful.

13:25.839 --> 13:27.140
Thank you.
Thank you.

13:27.174 --> 13:29.176
(phone vibrates)

13:30.177 --> 13:32.145
Oh.

13:32.179 --> 13:33.847
Hello?
Is that my dad?

13:33.881 --> 13:35.382
Yeah.

13:35.415 --> 13:36.716
XANDER:
Sam.

13:36.749 --> 13:37.985
Hi. What's up?

13:38.018 --> 13:39.987
(whispers):
Does he want to talk to me?

13:40.020 --> 13:42.422
Yeah, I'm at the airport.

13:42.455 --> 13:45.258
Um...

13:45.292 --> 13:47.895
You... You're what?

13:47.928 --> 13:49.296
Did you just land?

13:49.329 --> 13:51.298
Because you're due here

13:51.331 --> 13:52.966
in about ten minutes,

13:53.000 --> 13:54.467
according to the plan

13:54.501 --> 13:56.169
that you made

13:56.203 --> 13:58.005
with your daughter.

13:58.038 --> 14:01.508
No, no.
I'm about to board a plane.

14:01.541 --> 14:03.110
Not arriving.

14:03.143 --> 14:04.511
What?

14:04.544 --> 14:06.179
I'm at the airport because

14:06.213 --> 14:07.514
I'm about to get on a plane.

14:07.547 --> 14:09.116
I don't understand.

14:09.149 --> 14:11.151
Did you not fly here yet?

14:13.053 --> 14:15.055
I had a complication
in my schedule.

14:16.489 --> 14:18.926
It's very complicated.

14:18.959 --> 14:20.260
Um, and it's personal,

14:20.293 --> 14:22.229
so I can't share the details.

14:22.262 --> 14:25.665
Xander, what-what
are you saying?

14:26.900 --> 14:28.635
I'm not coming.

14:29.836 --> 14:31.972
I...
(sighs)

14:32.005 --> 14:33.740
(Marion coughing)

14:36.609 --> 14:39.312
I can't come.

14:39.346 --> 14:42.849
I'm... I'm not coming.
(Marion continues
coughing)

14:42.882 --> 14:44.184
I feel terrible.

14:46.286 --> 14:48.221
I know you're
judging me right now.

14:48.255 --> 14:49.722
People make their choices, Sam.

14:49.756 --> 14:51.058
Yeah.

14:51.091 --> 14:52.392
Yeah, they do.

14:52.425 --> 14:53.927
And it's not right
to judge people

14:53.961 --> 14:55.662
for doing what they must
for themselves.

14:55.695 --> 14:57.330
(sighs)

14:57.364 --> 14:58.865
Okay.

15:02.235 --> 15:04.104
(sighing)

15:24.324 --> 15:26.326
(breathing hard)

15:34.667 --> 15:35.702
(sniffs)

15:38.938 --> 15:41.908
(indistinct conversations)

15:41.941 --> 15:45.378
Marion, did you
bring a camera?

15:45.412 --> 15:48.115
(conversations continuing)

15:48.148 --> 15:51.584
Hold on. Mom,
what'd my dad say?

15:54.821 --> 15:56.756
Um...

15:56.789 --> 15:58.791
Mom?

16:02.929 --> 16:05.498
He's not coming, baby.

16:05.532 --> 16:08.935
What happened?

16:08.968 --> 16:11.238
SAM: Uh... I...
I don't know.

16:11.271 --> 16:12.839
Uh...

16:14.974 --> 16:17.444
He's not coming.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.479
He's getting on a plane.

16:20.647 --> 16:22.049
(sobs sharply)

16:22.082 --> 16:24.451
(sighs)
PHYLLIS: What happened?
Why is she crying?

16:26.186 --> 16:27.620
Xander's not coming, Phil.

16:27.654 --> 16:29.656
Oh, well, he was never coming.

16:32.292 --> 16:34.161
Sounds familiar.

16:34.194 --> 16:35.995
Your father didn't show up
for your graduation?

16:36.029 --> 16:38.565
She didn't come.

16:38.598 --> 16:40.633
Oh...
Oh, my God.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.802
Guys, guys.
Enough. Enough.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.304
Max.

16:44.337 --> 16:46.939
Max. Maxie.

16:46.973 --> 16:48.941
Maxie.

16:48.975 --> 16:52.011
Look at me. Look
at me. Look at me.

16:52.045 --> 16:55.148
That was a lot
for nothing, wasn't it?

16:55.182 --> 16:57.350
Max, breathe.

16:57.384 --> 16:59.386
Breathe.

17:03.990 --> 17:05.992
I can't believe

17:06.025 --> 17:08.995
he's not coming.

17:09.028 --> 17:12.865
It's okay,
because I'm gonna take you.

17:12.899 --> 17:14.801
You certainly are not.

17:14.834 --> 17:16.403
What?

17:16.436 --> 17:18.037
I'm taking you to tea.

17:18.071 --> 17:20.907
Mom, what are you talking about?

17:20.940 --> 17:23.176
It's my surprise.

17:23.210 --> 17:24.844
I'm taking you

17:24.877 --> 17:26.979
for afternoon tea,
just you and I,

17:27.013 --> 17:28.848
and then
we meet up later

17:28.881 --> 17:30.150
at her event.

17:30.183 --> 17:32.185
Phil, you didn't tell me.

17:32.219 --> 17:35.355
It was a surprise.

17:35.388 --> 17:38.057
Mom, I'm not
going anywhere with you.

17:38.091 --> 17:39.726
I have to take Max
to rehearsal.

17:39.759 --> 17:41.128
SUNNY:
I can take her.

17:41.161 --> 17:43.029
I can take her to rehearsal

17:43.062 --> 17:44.697
or whatever the plan was.

17:47.434 --> 17:48.835
I can take her.

17:51.571 --> 17:53.673
It would be an honor.

17:53.706 --> 17:55.508
Me too.

17:55.542 --> 17:58.745
Well, I think that I should
probably take you.

18:05.285 --> 18:07.254
See, baby?

18:07.287 --> 18:09.122
You got your choice.

18:13.260 --> 18:15.128
Mom?

18:17.797 --> 18:21.067
You're the best mom
in the world.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.869
(sniffles)

18:22.902 --> 18:25.438
* I'm glad I spent it
with you... *

18:25.472 --> 18:27.840
I want to go with Rich.

18:27.874 --> 18:30.277
Oh.

18:30.310 --> 18:32.412
Okay. Let's get going.

18:32.445 --> 18:34.914
(departing footsteps)

18:39.319 --> 18:41.454
(faintly):
Whoo, yeah.

18:41.488 --> 18:43.623
(short laugh)

18:44.657 --> 18:46.359
(exhales)

18:46.393 --> 18:47.927
Okay.

18:47.960 --> 18:50.630
I'm, uh...
(sniffs)

18:50.663 --> 18:52.199
calling an audible.

18:52.232 --> 18:53.200
(pats legs)

18:53.233 --> 18:54.767
(clears throat loudly)

18:54.801 --> 18:56.569
Rich is gonna take Max.

18:56.603 --> 18:59.539
And, uh, I am going to...

18:59.572 --> 19:01.841
tea with my mom,

19:01.874 --> 19:03.876
apparently.

19:03.910 --> 19:05.978
And, um...

19:06.012 --> 19:08.915
(groans)
Duke and Frankie...

19:08.948 --> 19:10.817
Dibs on them.

19:11.851 --> 19:13.986
...are going with Jeff.

19:14.020 --> 19:17.624
SAM:
So everybody else, good luck,

19:17.657 --> 19:19.426
Godspeed,

19:19.459 --> 19:22.195
and I'll see you
at the ceremony.

19:27.133 --> 19:29.101
I like tea.

19:29.135 --> 19:31.238
(indistinct chatter nearby)

19:31.271 --> 19:32.839
MARION:
Ha. No.

19:32.872 --> 19:34.841
So, honey, it's fine
that you didn't pick me.

19:34.874 --> 19:36.909
I wanted to give
you this privately,

19:36.943 --> 19:38.611
because it's not
for your mother, it's for you.

19:38.645 --> 19:40.547
Thank you.
I love you.

19:40.580 --> 19:42.181
Congratulations.
Love you, too.

19:45.452 --> 19:47.354
Uh-uh-uh-uh, you're
not riding back there.

19:47.387 --> 19:49.856
FRANKIE:
Why? I see dogs ride
in the back of trucks

19:49.889 --> 19:51.758
all the time.
Yeah, well,
no one cares

19:51.791 --> 19:53.426
if a dog gets thrown
across the highway.

19:53.460 --> 19:55.762
Babe, you don't have
seat belts.
Get in the cab.

19:55.795 --> 19:57.129
Sunny, come with us.

19:57.163 --> 19:59.065
No. Not her.

19:59.098 --> 20:02.001
We're going alone.
This is special.
Phil,

20:02.034 --> 20:03.503
don't push it.

20:03.536 --> 20:04.937
(whispers):
Come on.

20:06.873 --> 20:09.141
What's going on there?
Nothing.

20:09.175 --> 20:10.543
Whoa.
Maybe.

20:10.577 --> 20:11.578
Oh.

20:14.847 --> 20:16.849
(bird chirping)

20:45.244 --> 20:47.246
(upbeat song playing faintly)

20:57.590 --> 20:59.926
*

21:28.788 --> 21:31.057
Hi.

21:31.090 --> 21:32.291
Hi.

21:35.962 --> 21:38.097
How ya feelin'?

21:38.130 --> 21:41.300
Mm, it's like normal.

21:42.869 --> 21:46.906
You're probably thinking
about your future right now.

21:46.939 --> 21:49.642
Yeah, I guess so.

21:49.676 --> 21:52.311
Can I say one thing to you?

21:52.345 --> 21:54.481
Hmm?

21:54.514 --> 21:56.783
Plastics, Benjamin.

21:56.816 --> 21:58.818
(laughs)
Thanks.

22:03.189 --> 22:04.657
Mom.

22:04.691 --> 22:08.294
I didn't want to
say this, 'cause...

22:08.327 --> 22:10.963
I'm not, like, a
little kid anymore.

22:10.997 --> 22:15.435
And, like, this is stupid.

22:15.468 --> 22:18.705
But you didn't get me
a graduation present.

22:21.941 --> 22:24.276
Just, like, a thing.

22:24.310 --> 22:27.547
Or a something.

22:27.580 --> 22:29.682
This is...

22:29.716 --> 22:32.752
stupid, but, um...

22:32.785 --> 22:35.154
it's a little weird.

22:35.187 --> 22:37.490
I'm sort of surprised,

22:37.524 --> 22:39.459
like, and I don't want
to be a jerk about it,

22:39.492 --> 22:40.593
I really don't want...

22:45.732 --> 22:47.266
Oh.

22:47.299 --> 22:49.135
Oh.

Mom, it's so beautiful.

23:06.118 --> 23:08.755
Good, because that's not
your present, though.

23:10.156 --> 23:12.258
Come on.

23:22.969 --> 23:24.303
Oh.

way before Methuselah *

24:39.712 --> 24:42.749

with ammonia *

24:44.517 --> 24:47.520

with eyes all red *

24:49.656 --> 24:52.792

for all the tears they shed *

24:53.993 --> 24:55.995

while singing their thoughts *

25:32.599 --> 25:35.367
* I match them
with my euphoria *

"Je suis plus folle que toi" *
