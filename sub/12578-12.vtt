This may seem like an exotic getaway...

00:42.208 --> 00:44.472
from the hustle and bustle of the alley...

00:44.577 --> 00:47.410

My uncle was a cowboy in the rodeo.

He had to leave Vietnam because he was
waking up with rodeo nightmares.

02:20.773 --> 02:23.674
lt's just the kids' calf scramble. lt's fun.

Maybe we can start the healing...

14:03.141 --> 14:06.702
because the cowboys
and the clowns should be friends.

14:06.912 --> 14:10.678
We eat the same dust,
we've got the same smell--

14:13.618 --> 14:14.846
[Bobby groaning]

14:14.953 --> 14:16.511
BOBBY: What happened?

14:16.821 --> 14:20.814
The last thing l remember
is being kicked by a horse.

14:20.926 --> 14:21.915
Come on, Bobby.

14:22.027 --> 14:24.359
We can't let your dad see you
in clown makeup.

14:24.462 --> 14:27.920
Joseph, they say rodeo clowns
smell like cow pies.

14:28.033 --> 14:30.627
But l hear it's the other way around.

14:30.769 --> 14:31.929
[Boys chuckling]

14:35.240 --> 14:37.071
HANK: Your first concussion.

14:37.175 --> 14:40.144
Now, don't fall asleep, Son,
both because you could die...

14:40.245 --> 14:42.907
and because l wanna tell you
how proud l am.

14:43.014 --> 14:47.280
l mean, look at you:
the bruises, the dirty clothes, the smell.

14:47.652 --> 14:50.314
You're all right.
ls there anything l can get you?

14:50.422 --> 14:54.859
The blonde girl who lives here
said l like fruit pies.

14:54.960 --> 14:58.623
No, you don't. A tough guy like you,
you like sports.

14:59.431 --> 15:03.390
WlLLlE,. Kid, it's hard for an old clown
to admit he's made a mistake,

15:03.535 --> 15:06.163
A lot easier just to leave town
and change your name,

15:06.271 --> 15:10.401
But when l said you didn't have
what it takes to be a rodeo clown...

15:10.809 --> 15:12.140
l was wrong.

15:13.812 --> 15:16.144
Here's your ass pad, son.

15:19.718 --> 15:22.687
Your lunch money had a Canadian quarter.

15:22.954 --> 15:26.412
Dooley, that little squirt's
not bothering you.

15:26.725 --> 15:30.183
Now, if you wanna see
an annoying little squirt....

15:30.428 --> 15:31.395
[Students gasp]

15:38.870 --> 15:41.532
You've got dust coming out of your butt.

15:41.773 --> 15:44.469
Come on, Bobby.
You've proved your point.

15:44.576 --> 15:48.774
-You're weirding me out.
-Allow me to turn the other cheek.

15:53.285 --> 15:57.381
Look, Peggy, l think he's loping.
He's actually loping.

15:57.622 --> 16:00.887
Well, he's skipping now,
but he was loping.

16:00.992 --> 16:04.052
Our little cowboy is becoming a cow-man.

16:04.162 --> 16:08.599
l didn't tell Bobby, but l'm bringing a client
to the rodeo this afternoon.

16:08.700 --> 16:12.602
l wouldn't want Bobby to know
a propane sale is hanging in the balance.

16:13.171 --> 16:17.039
ANNOUNCER: Slap another buckle
on Joseph Gribble, his third one this week,

16:18.843 --> 16:20.743
Wait a minute, ladies and gentlemen,,,

16:20.845 --> 16:23.746
we have a late entrant
in the chicken-roping,

16:33.725 --> 16:36.250
[Lively instrumental music]

16:43.868 --> 16:45.961
The clown fell in some poop.

16:57.749 --> 16:59.876
That's my underwear.

17:00.885 --> 17:02.785
Well, that's one mystery solved.

17:02.887 --> 17:06.880
-But why would that clown want to--
-And those are Peggy's shoes.

17:06.991 --> 17:09.289
Hank, it's Bobby!

17:09.728 --> 17:10.819
Bobby?

17:11.061 --> 17:12.188
Bobby!

17:14.031 --> 17:15.896
lsn't that your friend?

17:17.702 --> 17:20.728
Well, he lives next door to me, but....

17:21.306 --> 17:24.298
They say that rodeo clowns smell
like cow pies...

17:24.409 --> 17:26.934
but l hear it's the other way around.

17:29.981 --> 17:32.176
He's funnier than Bobby, too.

17:39.657 --> 17:41.488
HANK: Maybe this is my fault.

17:41.593 --> 17:45.757
l kept clowns away from him as a child
so he never got scared by one.

17:45.864 --> 17:49.129
Do not be so hard on yourself.
lt is not your fault.

17:50.368 --> 17:54.566
lt's all my fault.
My uncle wasn't a cowboy, Hank.

17:54.839 --> 17:58.434
He was a dirty, drunken rodeo clown.

17:59.844 --> 18:02.210
Don't tell me. Uncle Boffo?

18:07.051 --> 18:09.076
That's Luanne's makeup.

18:09.287 --> 18:13.155
You're not only a clown, you're a thief.
l don't know which is worse.

18:13.892 --> 18:15.052
Clown.

18:16.449 --> 18:18.542
Bobby, l'm trying to help you.

18:18.652 --> 18:21.120
You see, a circus clown is a carny...

18:21.221 --> 18:24.384
who's too stupid
 to flip a ride switch on and off.

18:24.491 --> 18:28.052
Now, you take a circus clown,
roll him on the barn floor...

18:28.161 --> 18:31.426
and kick him in the head a couple
hundred times, and what've you got?

18:31.531 --> 18:32.793
Your son.

18:34.267 --> 18:35.359
Yep.

18:35.502 --> 18:36.469
Yep.

18:36.736 --> 18:37.998
[Hank sighs]

18:40.106 --> 18:41.767
[Dale humming]

18:42.342 --> 18:43.707
Okay, Dale.

18:44.644 --> 18:46.874
JOSEPH: Dad, l won the goat-roping...

18:46.980 --> 18:49.744
and they're gonna let me
ride a baby bull tomorrow.

18:49.849 --> 18:53.080
My time was so good,
they made me take a drug test.

18:53.653 --> 18:56.281
The only drug you're on is Gribblecillin.

18:56.389 --> 18:58.323
And you told me Gribblecillin...

18:58.425 --> 19:01.553
would possess
no performance-enhancing qualities.

19:08.401 --> 19:10.801
ANNOUNCER: Come on, stay with it,
Ride it out,

19:10.904 --> 19:12.303
Cheer up, Bobby.

19:12.405 --> 19:15.772
Except for the cowboy and the man
who straps the bull's genitals...

19:15.875 --> 19:20.073
there's nobody more important
than the friend cheering in the stands.

19:21.614 --> 19:23.206
ANNOUNCER: And now our special event,

19:23.316 --> 19:27.412

l love my boy.
Don't you love my boy, Hank?

19:34.861 --> 19:35.953
[Buzzer sounding]

JOSEPH: Come on.

19:49.776 --> 19:52.438
[Tense instrumental music]

19:56.149 --> 19:57.411

19:58.084 --> 19:59.210
Zip!

20:01.287 --> 20:02.720
[Chet grunts]

20:08.461 --> 20:12.454
WOMAN: Oh, dear.
That boy is gonna be gored.

20:15.468 --> 20:17.436

[Bull snorts]

20:21.941 --> 20:23.340
HANK: Bobby, wait.

20:30.683 --> 20:31.980
Go, Bobby.

20:34.287 --> 20:36.346
What are you talking about?

20:36.956 --> 20:39.720
What are you talking about?

20:56.609 --> 20:57.633
[Bobby groans]

20:57.744 --> 20:59.473
What did l eat?

21:02.615 --> 21:07.052
Please, everyone, avoid the nachos.

21:07.987 --> 21:09.579
[Crowd laughing]

21:22.235 --> 21:24.863
BOBBY: Don't worry, everybody. l'm fine.

21:26.673 --> 21:28.163
Not so fine,

21:29.042 --> 21:31.237
[Crowd laughing]

21:33.847 --> 21:36.145
[Slow instrumental music]

21:38.885 --> 21:41.376
There's only room for one autograph.

21:41.721 --> 21:45.487
BOBBY: l'd rather have one of your buckles.
JOSEPH: Okay.

21:45.592 --> 21:48.026
But that doesn't make you
my Buckle Bunny.

Yes, sir, it does.
