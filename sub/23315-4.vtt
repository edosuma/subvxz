WEBVTT

00:01.233 --> 00:01.433
.

00:10.333 --> 00:12.633
Oi, oi! we're back!

00:16.200 --> 00:19.100
Get me back in that house.
Aah!

00:19.167 --> 00:21.233
Stand by. Geordies incoming.

00:23.733 --> 00:25.500
Oh. My. God.

00:28.133 --> 00:30.800
I'm so excited,
I ca-ca-poo-poo'd in me
knickers.

00:38.700 --> 00:41.600
What's the three things
that Geordies are good at?

00:41.667 --> 00:42.933
Bucking,

00:43.000 --> 00:44.333
necking...

00:45.200 --> 00:46.600
...and drinking.

00:48.833 --> 00:51.033
Toon, we are coming for ya.

00:54.633 --> 00:56.233
Shit's about to go down.

00:57.767 --> 00:58.800
This is mint.

00:59.733 --> 01:01.100
(cheering)

01:03.567 --> 01:05.667
(all cheer)
Thank you, guys!

01:05.733 --> 01:09.300
This has got "best friend" on.
This is the nicest thing ever.

01:09.367 --> 01:12.800
My ex and my boyfriend are going
to be in the same house tonight.

01:16.033 --> 01:17.967
I can't say it any more!

01:18.033 --> 01:20.467
I'll fucking throw it out.
Casey!

01:24.700 --> 01:27.267
I took it way too far.
I feel terrible.

01:27.333 --> 01:30.300
Toon Tours are going to
Tenerife.
(all cheer)

01:30.367 --> 01:32.900
Aaron, you won't be travelling
with the others.

01:32.967 --> 01:35.400
If Aaron's not going, fuck it.
I'm not.

01:35.467 --> 01:37.967
See you later, the Toon.
Hello, Tenerife.

01:40.167 --> 01:42.700
(Abbie) I've left Chloe and Sam
in the pool.

01:42.767 --> 01:45.833
I'd like to believe that
she wouldn't get with him. Oops.

01:49.900 --> 01:52.733
I'm a natural beauty.
Real boobs, real hair.

01:52.800 --> 01:55.733
I'm a lad who's got more cheek
than a girl with fillers.

01:55.800 --> 01:58.567
I'm tanned, toned
and ready to tash on.

01:58.633 --> 02:00.500
I'm preened to perfection.

02:00.567 --> 02:02.800
I'm totally crackers, me, like.

02:02.867 --> 02:05.500
I'm cheeky, colourful
and full of mischief.

02:05.567 --> 02:08.267
I can talk the back legs
off a donkey.

02:08.333 --> 02:12.067
I might be entirely bonkers,
but all the best people are.

02:12.133 --> 02:14.067
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

02:26.233 --> 02:29.733
I've woke up this morning
in the villa in Tenerife.

02:29.800 --> 02:33.433
I feel like
a fucking badger's arsehole.

02:33.500 --> 02:35.800
I had the best night ever last
night.

02:35.867 --> 02:38.633
I know me and Abbie
had an agreement on Sam.

02:38.700 --> 02:42.267
But last night, me and Sam
necked on.
I am buzzing.

02:42.333 --> 02:44.667
We're in the pool
and me hair was all wet.

02:44.733 --> 02:47.667
It was quite sexy.
I thought, I can't not.

02:47.733 --> 02:50.567
So I went, "Fuck it.
I'm just gonna do it." I went...

02:50.633 --> 02:52.567
And he went...

02:52.633 --> 02:55.000
Because Chloe is happy,
it makes me happy.

02:55.067 --> 02:58.967
I'm just glad that a boy has
finally
put a smile on her face.

02:59.033 --> 03:02.133
If you're feeling bad for Abbie,
you need to sort it out.

03:02.200 --> 03:06.567
I can't be having that. I do
like
Sam. I get on with him really
well.

03:06.633 --> 03:10.333
Even though I do really like
Sam,
I am still worried about Abbie.

03:10.400 --> 03:13.300
I hope that she doesn't like
him.
I like him.

03:13.367 --> 03:16.900
I would hate it if she'd ever
get
hurt. That's the last thing I
want.

03:18.533 --> 03:21.467
Fucking dying, but it was
amazing.

03:21.533 --> 03:23.933
I think it was
a fucking mint first night.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.167
I love Tenerife.

03:25.233 --> 03:28.167
If this is what it's like
with the Geordies, bring it on.

03:28.233 --> 03:30.533
Why didn't you get with anyone
last night?

03:30.600 --> 03:34.067
I just wanted to see
where things go with Sam.

03:34.133 --> 03:35.867
I didn't pull anyone last night.

03:35.933 --> 03:39.033
My head's still all over
about the whole Sam situation.

03:39.100 --> 03:42.600
Pulling someone would have
made things more confusing.

03:42.667 --> 03:47.200
See how it goes. Round two
tonight.
(groans)

03:48.333 --> 03:51.533
You said to me last night,
"You can tell who I like the
most."

03:51.600 --> 03:53.100
Yeah, I did say that to you.

03:53.167 --> 03:56.467
It's very, very clear.
On the count of three, say the
name.

03:56.533 --> 03:58.500
One, two, three.
(both) Chloe.

03:58.567 --> 04:02.633
If you like Chloe,
maybe you should leave off on
Abbie.

04:02.700 --> 04:05.600
Obviously, you can still be
mates with her and stuff.

04:05.667 --> 04:08.600
Just don't be as forward
as you have been.

04:08.667 --> 04:11.500
It's only a matter of time
before something kicks off.

04:11.567 --> 04:15.400
Someone isn't being honest
about their feelings.

04:15.467 --> 04:17.600
How do I get myself
in these situations?

04:17.666 --> 04:21.666
I don't think it's you that
needs
to ask how Abbie feels. It's
Chloe.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.800
This looks different
to English bacon.

04:28.867 --> 04:32.200
When you have bacon from
England,
it's from a pig of England.

04:32.267 --> 04:35.200
I wonder if the pigs
actually talk English.

04:35.267 --> 04:36.867
It always gets us every time.

04:36.933 --> 04:39.733
Does a pig speak Spanish
or does it speak English?

04:39.800 --> 04:41.167
Oinks'll be different.

04:41.233 --> 04:43.600
That'll be different.
Oink, oink!

04:43.667 --> 04:45.667
Who gives a fuck? I want my
bacon.

04:47.767 --> 04:50.400
It's so hot,
especially when you're hungover.

04:50.467 --> 04:51.600
(phone rings)

04:53.367 --> 04:56.000
The only person
it's gonna be is Anna.

04:56.067 --> 04:58.133
How does this bitch have my
number?

05:02.767 --> 05:05.600
Shit. Anna's found out
that Marnie's not here.

05:05.667 --> 05:08.567
What the hell do I say?
Make up a lie, Chloe.

05:08.633 --> 05:11.333
She's got thrush. And diarrhoea.

05:11.400 --> 05:15.467
Don't worry, Anna. I am on the
case.
I have sent Marnie some Vagisil.

05:26.600 --> 05:28.867
Me, Steph and Nathan
are going to work.

05:28.933 --> 05:32.333
Nathan is gonna be wearing a
costume.
What a loser.

05:32.400 --> 05:36.267
We're going to be ambassadors.
You have got to wear an outfit
today.

05:36.333 --> 05:39.167
If Anna thinks I'm wearing a
costume
in this heat,

05:39.233 --> 05:42.367
she's got another thing coming.
I don't think so, darling.

05:42.433 --> 05:44.767
If Chloe, Nathan and Steph
are going to work,

05:44.833 --> 05:46.433
why don't we go camel riding?

05:46.500 --> 05:49.033
Oh, my God. I want to come.
We're not in Dubai.

05:49.100 --> 05:52.167
I'm so glad that I do not have
to work with this hangover.

05:52.233 --> 05:53.300
Riding these camels

05:53.367 --> 05:56.933
should give me the fresh air I
need
to be un-hungover.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.867
I'm so jealous. I want to come.

05:58.933 --> 06:01.267
I am excited to do the camel
riding.

06:01.333 --> 06:03.400
It means I can
spend some time with Sam

06:03.467 --> 06:05.400
without competing with anyone
else.

06:09.233 --> 06:11.700
Sam and Abbie are spending
the day together.

06:11.767 --> 06:13.633
He'd better not try it on with
her.

06:13.700 --> 06:16.867
Or worse, tell her that me and
him
necked on last night.

06:20.833 --> 06:21.967
Bye! Love you!

06:22.033 --> 06:24.700
This is mine and Steph's
first time working.

06:24.767 --> 06:26.833
I'm gonna show her how it's
done.

06:30.600 --> 06:32.333
Oh, my God. My knickers!

06:33.733 --> 06:37.300
Even though I am upset that
I'm not going camel riding with
Sam,

06:37.367 --> 06:39.667
I cannot wait to see Nathan
in his costume.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.200
Wagwan, ladies?

06:41.267 --> 06:44.500
What the fuck is Nathan wearing?

06:44.567 --> 06:48.433
We're supposed to be encouraging
people to come to Newcastle.

06:48.500 --> 06:49.967
Not scaring them off.

06:51.100 --> 06:52.367
No!

06:52.433 --> 06:54.967
He's dressed as a stottie.
I'm pure starving.

06:55.033 --> 06:57.067
I might have a bit of a munch.

06:57.133 --> 07:01.700
I have never seen a stottie so
camp
and so flouncy as I am right
now.

07:01.767 --> 07:04.200
I'm not handing out a flyer.
I'm dancing.

07:04.267 --> 07:06.667
# I'm a stottie
In the middle of the street #

07:06.733 --> 07:09.433
Get yourself to the Toon.
Can I give you a flyer?

07:09.500 --> 07:11.867
Have a rub.
Taste the bread.

07:11.933 --> 07:14.767
I've never had this much
female attention in my life.

07:14.833 --> 07:17.033
Thank you.
Want a flyer?

07:17.100 --> 07:18.600
Guess not. Stuck-up bitch.

07:18.667 --> 07:22.200
Flyering is not my forte.
I'm gonna leave Nathan to it.

07:22.267 --> 07:24.133
What's the craic with you and
Sam?

07:24.200 --> 07:27.967
I don't want to go further
until I know how Abbie feels.

07:28.033 --> 07:29.567
She does actually like him.

07:29.633 --> 07:31.867
That's why she didn't go
on the pull.

07:31.933 --> 07:34.600
I'm confused
that Abbie's saying she likes
Sam.

07:34.667 --> 07:37.000
They haven't done anything.

07:37.067 --> 07:39.667
Me and Sam necked on last night.
Did yous?

07:39.733 --> 07:42.733
Oh, my God.
Sam and Chloe kissed in the
pool.

07:42.800 --> 07:45.867
Someone needs to tell Abbie,
cos she's gonna be livid.

07:45.933 --> 07:49.767
You need to sit her down and
say,
"Look, I fucking really like
him."

07:49.833 --> 07:52.800
"I'm not just saying this.
I genuinely really like him."

07:52.867 --> 07:55.633
Steph is right.
I do need to chat to Abbie about
Sam.

07:55.700 --> 07:57.533
It's getting way out of hand.

07:57.600 --> 08:00.767
There's going to be
a massive explosion.

08:00.833 --> 08:03.167
He will never come between me
and Abbie.

08:03.233 --> 08:04.900
I will always put her first.

08:04.967 --> 08:07.633
It's 40 degrees.
I'm dressed as a stottie,

08:07.700 --> 08:11.300
working my arse off,
while them two are chatting.

08:11.367 --> 08:15.267
I'm that hot, my arsehole's
starting
to leak. It's like a fountain.

08:17.967 --> 08:21.300
I'm too hungover for fucking
camels,
if I'm honest.

08:21.367 --> 08:25.300
I am an expert in riding camels.
I've ridden camels before.

08:25.367 --> 08:27.833
Well, one,
but I am an expert on riding
them.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.967
Oi-oi, camel.
That's like Chloe's lips.

08:35.033 --> 08:38.167
Camels have a cock
of half a metre long.

08:38.232 --> 08:41.267
I didn't think you were
gonna come out with that fact.

08:41.332 --> 08:43.933
No. Look at that.
It's got a camel toe.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.667
(laughs)

08:45.733 --> 08:47.933
It looks the same.

08:48.967 --> 08:50.933
Let's have a camel-toe-off.

08:52.967 --> 08:55.167
(camel makes noise)
Fucking hell.

08:55.233 --> 08:57.633
This is making my hangover
even worse.

08:57.700 --> 09:01.033
I'm standing in front of a
camel,
watching it spit. Oh.

09:02.567 --> 09:03.867
Where's my seatbelt?

09:03.933 --> 09:07.667
We're like the Three Wise Men.
Going to get frank, myrrh and
sense.

09:07.733 --> 09:10.200
You need some fucking sense.

09:11.233 --> 09:12.767
Rollercoaster, go!

09:12.833 --> 09:15.900
We're on our first date on a
camel.
Who'd have thought?

09:15.967 --> 09:19.533
What? Wait a second, is this a
date?
I don't know, is it?

09:19.600 --> 09:22.300
Sam's just said
it's like our first date.

09:22.367 --> 09:24.267
All I can think
in the back of my head

09:24.333 --> 09:26.300
is how Chloe would feel
about this.

09:26.367 --> 09:29.000
You're riding that camel quite
well.
You think?

09:29.067 --> 09:30.300
I think so, yeah.

09:30.367 --> 09:33.033
Fuck me. This camel is making
my thoughts go wild.

09:33.100 --> 09:36.367
All I can see is Abbie's boobs
bouncing up and down.

09:36.433 --> 09:39.733
I didn't expect our first ride
together to be like this.

09:39.800 --> 09:41.733
I pictured it very differently.

09:41.800 --> 09:44.067
Sam kissed Chloe in the pool
last night.

09:44.133 --> 09:45.833
Now he's flirting with Abbie.

09:45.900 --> 09:49.300
Who does he think he is, playing
these girls against each other?

09:49.367 --> 09:52.133
It's been all right, this camel.
Good day out.

09:52.200 --> 09:56.000
It's not quite Alton Towers,
but we've enjoyed ourselves.

09:59.033 --> 10:00.167
Hello!

10:08.167 --> 10:09.900
Things I need to do today.

10:09.967 --> 10:12.533
Hand out flyers for that bitch
Anna.
Done.

10:12.600 --> 10:16.400
Speak to Abbie so I can neck on
with
Sam all night long, not done.

10:16.467 --> 10:17.467
I think that's it.

10:17.533 --> 10:21.800
I need to know how you feel
about Sam. Cos I do like him.

10:21.867 --> 10:25.333
I could see things going quite
far
between me and him.

10:25.400 --> 10:29.733
I would never want to upset you
or kiss him in front of you.

10:29.800 --> 10:34.333
Today is the first day that me
and
Sam have spent proper time
together.

10:34.400 --> 10:36.167
Chloe is asking us if I like
him.

10:36.233 --> 10:40.533
It's too early to say if I do or
not
and I'm a bit confused.

10:40.600 --> 10:41.967
I do like him,

10:42.033 --> 10:45.800
but because I didn't know how
you felt, I've been a bit held
back.

10:45.867 --> 10:48.233
Abbie admitted
that she really likes Sam.

10:48.300 --> 10:51.800
I want to tell her about last
night.
This is not the right time.

10:51.867 --> 10:54.867
If you see us necking on,
how would you feel about that?

10:54.933 --> 10:58.267
It would feel, "Why doesn't he
want me? Am I not good enough?"

10:58.333 --> 11:00.667
It's the thought of
feeling second best.

11:00.733 --> 11:03.867
I don't want to move forwards
with anything more

11:03.933 --> 11:05.967
unless I have your blessing.

11:06.033 --> 11:09.167
Chloe's asking for my blessing
for her and Sam. I'm torn.

11:09.233 --> 11:11.500
It would be hard
to see them together,

11:11.567 --> 11:14.767
but the fact that she's asked me
means a lot.

11:14.833 --> 11:18.233
If you want to pursue it with
him,
you can.

11:18.300 --> 11:22.833
Yes! I am so happy that Abbie
has finally given me her
blessing.

11:22.900 --> 11:25.167
Watch out, Sam! I'm coming for
you.

11:29.700 --> 11:33.900
Let's get ready and get
the glad rags on to hit
Tenerife.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.600
What happened with the chat
with Abbie?

11:42.667 --> 11:45.400
She doesn't know about the kiss
last night.

11:45.467 --> 11:49.833
Chloe didn't tell Abbie
she necked on with Sam last
night.

11:49.900 --> 11:51.633
Chloe, that was the whole reason

11:51.700 --> 11:55.433
you and Abbie were meant to have
the conversation in the first
place.

11:55.500 --> 11:56.800
You didn't tell her?

11:56.867 --> 11:58.033
No.

11:58.100 --> 11:59.100
Chloe!

11:59.167 --> 12:01.567
We have been necking on
since the start.

12:01.633 --> 12:04.667
I don't know why yesterday
is made such a big deal of.

12:04.733 --> 12:06.900
I've made a little plan in my
brain.

12:06.967 --> 12:09.833
I've decided I can talk
and have a bit of a flirt.

12:09.900 --> 12:13.133
Talk to him in front of her.
Try not to kiss him in front of
her.

12:13.200 --> 12:14.333
Don't fuck this up.

12:14.400 --> 12:15.467
Chloe likes Sam.

12:15.533 --> 12:19.733
I'm hoping that my best friend
will have a new boy mate very
soon.

12:19.800 --> 12:23.500
# I'm going to see your
boyfriend
You're gonna suck his dick #

12:25.300 --> 12:28.333
Sam is not my boyfriend.
But I like the way it sounds.

12:29.633 --> 12:31.667
How did your chat go today
with Chloe?

12:31.733 --> 12:36.833
She said that she did really
like
Sam and she asked for my
blessing.

12:36.900 --> 12:39.200
I said, "You can totally
do what you want."

12:39.267 --> 12:41.467
"Not gonna lie,
it's not going to be nice

12:41.533 --> 12:45.100
if I'm in the club and you're
necking on in front of us."

12:45.167 --> 12:47.500
It's going to be a bit
upsetting.

12:47.567 --> 12:51.733
I didn't tell Chloe, when we
were
riding the camels today,

12:51.800 --> 12:54.433
he was saying
it's like our first date and
stuff.

12:54.500 --> 12:56.033
Is that what he said?

12:56.100 --> 12:58.933
I had a feeling
that Sam was playing two girls.

12:59.000 --> 13:02.133
Now what Abbie's just told us,
he is a player.

13:02.200 --> 13:04.600
Last night, when we all went to
bed,

13:04.667 --> 13:08.833
Sam and Chloe were in the pool
together and they kissed.

13:08.900 --> 13:10.033
Really?

13:10.100 --> 13:13.200
What was the point in mine
and Chloe's conversation?

13:13.267 --> 13:16.467
She could have told us that she
necked on with Sam last night.

13:16.533 --> 13:18.867
She didn't.
I feel like I've been lied to.

13:18.933 --> 13:22.633
He's got two pretty girls
that he can just go in between
of.

13:23.933 --> 13:27.367
To the second night in Tenerife!
(all cheer)

13:27.433 --> 13:30.167
Let's go to the fucking club!
Let's go to the club!

13:30.233 --> 13:32.167
Chloe and Sam sitting in a tree.

13:32.233 --> 13:34.467
K-F-C-C-I-N-G.

13:34.533 --> 13:35.833
Get me in the club!

13:35.900 --> 13:37.500
Let's go!

13:39.467 --> 13:42.200
Me and Sam are necking on
behind the curtain.

13:42.267 --> 13:45.100
So fit, you know.
You've got no idea.

13:46.200 --> 13:47.667
Sam who?

13:53.233 --> 13:55.467
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

13:58.000 --> 13:58.200
.

14:00.700 --> 14:00.900
.

14:13.300 --> 14:14.467
(cheers)

14:14.533 --> 14:16.300
We are raring for tonight.

14:16.367 --> 14:19.300
Posh club in Tenerife?
Cheers to that.

14:26.400 --> 14:30.267
Get to the club and it's so
posh.
I feel like I fit in really
well,

14:30.333 --> 14:32.900
cos I'm wearing a tartan skirt
and that is posh.

14:39.700 --> 14:41.700
Tonight is gonna be off it.

14:48.867 --> 14:52.667
Abbie's fanny fucking stinks.
She needs to solve that ASAP.

15:08.367 --> 15:11.733
If you wouldn't mind fucking
off,
I need to speak to my boyfriend.

15:13.067 --> 15:16.067
Chloe has already ditched me
for Sam.

15:17.233 --> 15:19.133
That's fine. I'll sit with
Sophie.

15:31.600 --> 15:35.067
I am so happy to hear that.
That Sam actually likes us.

15:35.133 --> 15:36.233
I am over the moon.

15:52.100 --> 15:55.233
Tell you one thing, Sam.
I am anything but boring.

15:55.300 --> 15:57.367
Buh-oh-ruh-ih-nuh-guh. Boring.

16:12.633 --> 16:15.300
We have agreed
not to shove it in Abbie's face

16:15.367 --> 16:17.267
cos we do not want to hurt her.

16:20.300 --> 16:23.467
Me and Sam need to neck on,
so we do it behind the curtain.

16:27.033 --> 16:29.867
I knew seeing Sam and Chloe
together would be hard.

16:29.933 --> 16:31.867
Seeing them after Chloe lied

16:31.933 --> 16:34.000
and after Sam's been
flirting with us

16:34.067 --> 16:35.600
is just fucking annoying.

16:43.933 --> 16:46.233
Sam fancies being a spoon.
That's cush.

16:46.300 --> 16:48.500
I fancy being a fork. Or a
knife!

16:52.333 --> 16:54.233
I'm having a mint time with
Chloe,

16:54.300 --> 16:56.233
but I need to have a word
with Abbie,

16:56.300 --> 16:59.233
set the record straight
and tell her what I want.

17:09.733 --> 17:12.833
If he knew that, he should have
told us instead of flirting.

17:16.933 --> 17:19.967
I can see Sam talking to Abbie.
I hope he isn't flirting.

17:20.032 --> 17:23.833
I don't want that again. I don't
want
a boy that I like who's a
dickhead.

17:33.900 --> 17:36.567
At no stage has there been
any type of game playing.

17:36.633 --> 17:39.067
When I walked through that door,
first day,

17:39.133 --> 17:42.067
first thing I said was
I want to get to know everybody.

17:42.133 --> 17:43.567
That's what I've done.

18:01.100 --> 18:04.367
Sam's playing games
and Chloe is not being honest.

18:04.433 --> 18:06.167
They're both mugging me off.

18:06.233 --> 18:09.033
I don't want to be part of
this love triangle any more.

18:20.033 --> 18:22.133
I can't believe
Sam has just said that.

18:22.200 --> 18:23.800
I am no-one's sloppy seconds.

18:23.867 --> 18:27.433
Even though I am pissed off at
Chloe
for not telling me about the
kiss,

18:27.500 --> 18:30.033
she needs to know
what Sam is really like.

18:43.900 --> 18:47.867
I'm so happy that Abbie is
giving me and Sam the blessing.

18:47.933 --> 18:49.867
We can do what we want,
when we want.

18:49.933 --> 18:53.433
Bring on the Femidom,
cos I'm getting some action
tonight!

19:11.033 --> 19:14.700
I do feel bad for Abbie.
She's not had much luck with
Sam.

19:14.767 --> 19:18.667
But fuck it. Tonight, I'm gonna
get her to find a gorgeous man.

19:22.400 --> 19:24.633
I can't wait to get on the pull
with Steph

19:24.700 --> 19:27.100
and forget about
this whole Sam situation.

19:27.167 --> 19:28.600
I may be second best there,

19:28.667 --> 19:31.700
but I'm going to pull
the hottest guy in the club

19:31.767 --> 19:33.567
and prove that I don't care.

19:49.633 --> 19:53.200
She might have disco minge,
but she doesn't have disco
breath.

19:53.267 --> 19:55.600
Haway, Abbie. Let's get on the
pull.

19:59.000 --> 20:02.700
I'm scouting the club and I've
just
seen the hottest guy ever.

20:02.767 --> 20:05.500
He puts the "ten" in Tenerife.
I'm having him.

20:08.367 --> 20:11.967
Finally, one of the girls
listened
to my advice and pulled a boy.

20:12.033 --> 20:13.933
I feel very proud right now.

20:15.500 --> 20:18.300
He's so fit, you know.
You've got no idea.

20:18.367 --> 20:20.067
He just doesn't speak English.

20:20.133 --> 20:22.633
I can speak Spanish,
so it's all good.

20:30.700 --> 20:33.333
Well, hello, worldie. Sam who?

20:35.533 --> 20:37.367
Yes! Abbie's pulled a lad.

20:37.433 --> 20:40.567
I hope she's not doing it
just to make Sam jealous.

20:42.600 --> 20:45.667
I'm so happy that all this drama
between Abbie and Chloe

20:45.733 --> 20:46.833
is finally sorted.

20:46.900 --> 20:49.333
Now we can get on
like a proper family again.

20:52.667 --> 20:55.900
I can see Sam staring at my
booty
while I twerk.

20:55.967 --> 20:57.433
I bet you like that, son.

20:58.800 --> 21:02.300
I can't take my eyes
off Chloe's arse. It is huge.

21:04.833 --> 21:07.233
Everyone is shit-faced.

21:07.300 --> 21:10.400
We need to get home
before we destroy this club.

21:19.200 --> 21:23.867
Steph, what was the lad like?
He was called Aaron, for
starters.

21:23.933 --> 21:27.367
The guy that Steph pulled
was called Aaron.

21:27.433 --> 21:29.067
Hmm. Coincidence.

21:29.133 --> 21:31.533
His kiss was eleven out of ten.
Was it?

21:31.600 --> 21:33.867
He gave us fanny flutter.

21:33.933 --> 21:37.033
I haven't had fanny flutter
in a really long time.

21:37.100 --> 21:38.400
It made us happy.

21:39.500 --> 21:41.367
Who else pulled?
Abbie.

21:44.867 --> 21:48.400
Sam seems a bit too interested
in the lad that I pulled.

21:48.467 --> 21:49.600
Jealous much, Sam?

21:51.467 --> 21:54.033
Get the fuck
out of my motherfucking way.

21:56.633 --> 21:59.100
Walk. Hey. Down. Fuck.

21:59.167 --> 22:02.633
Get back to the house and I am
so hungry from all that
twerking.

22:02.700 --> 22:04.433
Give me some fucking food.

22:07.667 --> 22:09.100
I loved it.

22:09.167 --> 22:11.233
I'm glad them two had a good
night.

22:11.300 --> 22:13.033
Apart from me pulling a lad,

22:13.100 --> 22:15.933
all that I got tonight
was mugged off by Chloe and Sam.

22:16.000 --> 22:19.600
We had that chat. You said you
didn't want to do anything with
Sam

22:19.667 --> 22:21.133
until you got my blessing.

22:21.200 --> 22:24.400
But then I found out you necked
on
with him last night.

22:24.467 --> 22:25.633
The bitch did what?

22:25.700 --> 22:28.633
Ooh, girl, no, he didn't!

22:28.700 --> 22:32.167
Not being funny, but I've been
necking on with him since day
one.

22:32.233 --> 22:35.400
I feel like you wanted to tell
me
the truth this afternoon,

22:35.467 --> 22:38.600
but you didn't.
You told us that you liked him.

22:38.667 --> 22:41.867
Why are you bringing this up?
I thought this was sorted.

22:41.933 --> 22:45.567
Yes, I haven't been completely
honest. What does that matter
now?

22:45.633 --> 22:49.100
Abbie! You're actually
really getting on my nerves.

22:49.167 --> 22:52.767
You're pissing us off. You said
you wanted to be honest with me.

22:52.833 --> 22:56.000
Why is Abbie going in on us?
I just want her to be happy for
us.

22:56.067 --> 23:00.000
Me and Sam, day one,
have been fucking necking on,
Abbie.

23:00.067 --> 23:03.633
So don't fucking be cheeky
to fucking me. I swear to God!

23:06.500 --> 23:09.633
Fucking hell.
Chloe is going fucking mental.

23:09.700 --> 23:12.867
I couldn't give a fuck
if you've been necking on with
him.

23:12.933 --> 23:15.267
It's the principle of you lying.

23:15.333 --> 23:17.700
I can't believe
Chloe is the one shouting

23:17.767 --> 23:19.500
when she's the one that's lied.

23:19.567 --> 23:21.767
How about this for some truth,
Chloe?

23:31.000 --> 23:33.633
That's what he said to me.
That's what he said to me.

23:35.400 --> 23:39.167
I'm so fucking angry. I just
didn't think Sam was like that.

23:39.233 --> 23:41.400
I swear to God. Fuck off.

23:41.467 --> 23:43.967
The girls shouldn't be arguing
over Sam.

23:44.033 --> 23:45.133
I think, right now,

23:45.200 --> 23:48.667
he needs to step the fuck up
and say exactly what he's
thinking.

23:50.767 --> 23:53.300
Do you or do you not
want to get with Chloe?

23:53.367 --> 23:56.000
Sam told me tonight
that he does not like Abbie.

23:56.067 --> 23:59.700
Now when Nathan's asking
if he likes her, he's not
answering.

23:59.767 --> 24:01.667
I'm so fucking angry!

24:04.600 --> 24:06.233
I fucking hate the situation.

24:06.300 --> 24:08.767
Psycho Chloe
has superhuman strength.

24:08.833 --> 24:11.700
The table was there. Now it's
gone.

24:14.833 --> 24:18.033
(screams)

24:18.100 --> 24:21.467
Chloe has lost her fucking head
over something so little.

24:21.533 --> 24:24.100
What would she be like
if it was a major deal?

24:24.167 --> 24:27.300
(screams)

24:30.733 --> 24:33.200
This has stemmed from a shitty
joke

24:33.267 --> 24:36.133
saying if I didn't get with
Chloe,
I'd get with Abbie.

24:36.200 --> 24:38.100
Maybe I'm not as funny as I
thought.

24:42.433 --> 24:44.300
Hey. Hey.

24:46.567 --> 24:48.800
Right now,
Sam has been fucking stupid.

24:48.867 --> 24:52.533
When it comes to my best
friend's
emotions, I'm not having that.

24:55.667 --> 24:56.933
Listen.

24:58.700 --> 25:01.100
(cries) I'm just sick.
I'm sick of it.

25:03.133 --> 25:06.367
Me and Nathan try to calm
Chloe down. It's not happening.

25:06.433 --> 25:10.633
She's getting so upset and she's
just sick of getting hurt by
lads.

25:15.933 --> 25:17.633
Water park!

25:17.700 --> 25:18.833
How's your day been?

25:18.900 --> 25:21.233
Why the hell is Chloe
still not talking to me?

25:24.633 --> 25:27.400
Sam can fuck off. Me, Steph and
Abbie
are on the pull

25:27.467 --> 25:29.700
and I'm going to make him
jealous.

25:30.667 --> 25:32.633
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

25:35.467 --> 25:35.667
.

25:38.200 --> 25:38.400
.

25:52.267 --> 25:55.100
Oh, my God, yous.
I've just remembered something.

25:55.167 --> 25:58.000
I've woke up this morning.
I'm so upset and so angry.

25:58.067 --> 26:00.300
Why did Sam have to do that
last night?

26:00.367 --> 26:03.333
I was eating a chip.
I was chucking it off his face.

26:03.400 --> 26:05.867
You slapped him with a bit of
food
at one point.

26:05.933 --> 26:09.667
I thought Sam was different
than the other lads in the
house.

26:09.733 --> 26:11.800
He's not.
He's an absolute dickhead.

26:11.867 --> 26:14.533
What was it that wound you up?
He said to Abbie

26:14.600 --> 26:19.333
that if things don't work out
between
me and him, he's always got her.

26:19.400 --> 26:22.200
Sam's either trying
to get his way out of this,

26:22.267 --> 26:24.233
or he's actually that stupid

26:24.300 --> 26:26.900
he can't control
what comes out of his mouth.

26:26.967 --> 26:29.833
I'm not speaking to him today.

26:29.900 --> 26:31.333
So fucking awkward.

26:33.667 --> 26:35.833
What the fuck went on?

26:35.900 --> 26:38.733
I was trying to explain to Chloe
why I was pissed off.

26:38.800 --> 26:43.667
I explained to her that I cut
things
off to let them crack on.

26:43.733 --> 26:45.133
And she goes on like that.

26:45.200 --> 26:47.833
How do you think
you're gonna cope with her?

26:47.900 --> 26:50.133
I would like her to come over to
me.

26:50.200 --> 26:53.867
There was no need to go on
like that, screaming in my face.

26:53.933 --> 26:58.000
I am nervous about seeing Chloe.
I know it's gonna be dead
awkward.

26:58.067 --> 27:01.167
What I wanted to do
was get the truth out of Chloe,

27:01.233 --> 27:03.633
have it out with Chloe,

27:03.700 --> 27:06.500
and then I think it all got
turned around on Sam.

27:06.567 --> 27:07.800
He kind of deserved it

27:07.867 --> 27:10.400
because he can't be
saying one thing to me

27:10.467 --> 27:12.900
and then another thing to Chloe.

27:12.967 --> 27:16.467
Abbie's done the right thing,
calling Sam out over his
behaviour.

27:16.533 --> 27:19.567
It's a shame that her and Chloe
had to fall out over him.

27:19.633 --> 27:21.133
Sam's really annoyed me.

27:21.200 --> 27:23.500
I'm watching him
mug both my friends off.

27:23.567 --> 27:26.800
People are going to call you out
if you're doing shady stuff.

27:26.867 --> 27:29.933
Sam can't play two girls
off each other in this house.

27:30.000 --> 27:31.600
You will get caught.

27:34.467 --> 27:37.267
Wow.
Oh, my days.

27:37.333 --> 27:40.033
Oh, my God, do you get bad luck
from smashing glass?

27:40.100 --> 27:43.267
No, that's smashing a mirror,
thick twat.

27:43.333 --> 27:44.900
This is awkward, isn't it?

27:46.167 --> 27:49.600
Where we all sat last night.
I'm feeling the awkwardness.

27:49.667 --> 27:52.500
Not gonna lie.
More awkward when Sam comes
down.

27:52.567 --> 27:54.633
Chloe!
What?

27:54.700 --> 27:55.967
Do you feel awkward?

27:57.900 --> 27:59.033
Do ya?
Mm-hmm.

27:59.867 --> 28:03.933
I'm feeling very nervous about
how everyone is going to react.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.433
In fact, I'm not nervous.
I'm shitting myself.

28:07.433 --> 28:11.233
All right?
Morning, Samuel.

28:11.300 --> 28:14.000
This is worse than
what I thought it was gonna be.

28:14.067 --> 28:16.200
Chloe's doesn't want to talk to
Sam.

28:16.267 --> 28:18.367
Sam still has
a massive smile on his face

28:18.433 --> 28:20.100
and Abbie hasn't said a word.

28:20.167 --> 28:22.133
I do hold my hands up.

28:22.200 --> 28:26.700
I made the comment to Abbie
while we
were doing that fucking camel
ride.

28:26.767 --> 28:29.567
I did say something
maybes I shouldn't have said.

28:29.633 --> 28:33.433
I'm away with my words.
And I don't feel in the wrong.

28:33.500 --> 28:35.767
The more Sam speaks,
the more angry I get.

28:35.833 --> 28:37.600
He's just really, really hurt
us.

28:37.667 --> 28:39.300
(laughs)

28:39.367 --> 28:41.567
Sam doesn't think he's in the
wrong.

28:41.633 --> 28:44.400
The boy is stupider
than he even looks.

28:44.467 --> 28:47.000
How can you not know
what you've done is wrong?

28:47.067 --> 28:49.800
Do you think I've played you?
Yeah, I do.

28:49.867 --> 28:52.333
You say one thing to me
and one thing to Chloe.

28:52.400 --> 28:55.500
What I'm saying to both of
you...
You might not think it.

28:55.567 --> 28:57.167
I think you are.

28:57.233 --> 28:59.433
I don't think
Sam is telling the truth.

28:59.500 --> 29:02.800
When me and Chloe were arguing,
he looked smug as hell.

29:02.867 --> 29:06.267
Seeing as the house is in
turmoil
and Chloe trashed the place,

29:06.333 --> 29:09.633
I think today,
how about we go to the water
park?!

29:09.700 --> 29:12.067
Oh, my God. That'll be unreal.

29:12.133 --> 29:15.167
This could be a really good
opportunity for us to make up,

29:15.233 --> 29:17.633
or it could be
the most awkward day ever.

29:17.700 --> 29:20.167
Right, yous, fuck off and get
ready.

29:24.133 --> 29:28.233
I love water parks
more than I love my boyfriend.

29:28.300 --> 29:30.733
So Sam best not ruin today.

29:32.800 --> 29:34.833
I am really excited
for the water park.

29:34.900 --> 29:38.600
But it's gonna be really awkward
between me, Abbie and Sam today.

29:46.433 --> 29:48.267
This place is amazing.

29:48.333 --> 29:52.300
It's like a whole wet world
inside the real world.

29:52.367 --> 29:53.833
How's your day been?

29:53.900 --> 29:55.267
I'm loving that, though.

29:55.333 --> 29:59.033
I'm trying to talk to Chloe and
she
walks in the opposite direction.

29:59.100 --> 30:01.733
Winning her back
is harder than I thought.

30:01.800 --> 30:04.733
Look at that one there.
That would be Sophie. That's us.

30:04.800 --> 30:07.567
That would be me.
I'd be the big fat one.

30:11.633 --> 30:13.333
Have you even spoke to Sam?
No.

30:13.400 --> 30:15.800
He's tried to speak to us
and I've ignored him.

30:15.867 --> 30:20.000
Today is all about having fun at
the water park. Sam can fuck
off.

30:20.067 --> 30:22.433
With Martin and stuff in the
past,

30:22.500 --> 30:24.967
when I've been hurt,
I've been too easy on boys.

30:25.033 --> 30:28.233
I'm going to give him a hard
time.
You always crawl back.

30:28.300 --> 30:32.033
I am really proud of Chloe.
Usually, she would go back
there.

30:32.100 --> 30:35.833
Whenever Marty was horrible to
her,
she'd speak to him the next day.

30:35.900 --> 30:37.767
With Sam, something's different.

30:37.833 --> 30:39.567
Stick together.
Yes, girls.

30:39.633 --> 30:41.367
Girls stick together.

30:51.867 --> 30:53.667
Abbie, can I have a word,
please?

30:53.733 --> 30:55.867
I need to tell Abbie
I am actually sorry.

30:55.933 --> 30:59.467
She's my friend and I don't want
her
to think we aren't friends.

30:59.533 --> 31:02.400
I want to first off by
apologising
for not telling you.

31:02.467 --> 31:05.933
I didn't tell you at the club
cos we were both drunk.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.533
Chloe should have
told me about the kiss.

31:08.600 --> 31:11.933
Her intentions were good
and I see where she was coming
from.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.133
I'm done with Sam.

31:13.200 --> 31:18.333
I can't risk getting into what
I used to be with Marty.
Domestic.

31:18.400 --> 31:21.733
I hope if Chloe does crack on
with Sam, he doesn't mug her
off.

31:21.800 --> 31:23.867
Don't let Sam come between wuh
again.

31:23.933 --> 31:26.167
Even though we have said this
before,

31:26.233 --> 31:28.700
I'm gonna try not to let a lad
get between wuh.

31:28.767 --> 31:31.500
I'm happy that we've made up.
I feel relieved.

31:31.567 --> 31:33.000
This morning, I was like,

31:33.067 --> 31:35.800
"I don't want to spend the day
us not speaking."

31:35.867 --> 31:39.267
We have both said we're not
gonna
let a boy come in between us.

31:39.333 --> 31:40.667
This time, we mean it.

31:40.733 --> 31:42.467
Cheers.
Cheers, cheers.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.400
I know that I fucked up.
I do feel bad.

31:56.467 --> 31:58.900
Why the hell is Chloe still not
talking to me?

32:08.367 --> 32:10.500
We've had a good day
at the water park.

32:10.567 --> 32:13.967
I don't think Chloe will be
sliding
down my pipe any time soon.

32:14.033 --> 32:16.767
Let's get back
and get ready to go out.

32:25.000 --> 32:30.500
Today has been wicked.
Tonight is going to be even
better.

32:40.200 --> 32:43.100
It's been a funny day.
We've been at the water park.

32:43.167 --> 32:46.867
The vibes I've been getting...
I did make an effort with Chloe.

32:46.933 --> 32:50.800
I asked if she wanted to go on
rides
with me. She just went, "No."

32:50.867 --> 32:54.800
Sam, you fucked up.
Chloe is punishing you.

32:54.867 --> 32:57.233
Of course she's not
going to speak to you.

32:57.300 --> 33:00.400
You can't tell Chloe you like
her
and then say to Abbie,

33:00.467 --> 33:03.400
"If things don't work out,
I'll take you on a date."

33:03.467 --> 33:04.600
I said it as a joke.

33:04.667 --> 33:07.033
Abbie's the type
that takes that as literal.

33:07.100 --> 33:09.100
I wish I knew what "literal"
means.

33:09.167 --> 33:12.467
I thought you were different.
Don't you give me that as well.

33:12.533 --> 33:15.200
I'm not mad at you.
I'm very disappointed.

33:15.267 --> 33:16.467
That's worse.

33:16.533 --> 33:18.433
Even Nathan's digging me out
here.

33:18.500 --> 33:21.967
I do like Chloe, but I am
a cheeky lad. I said it as a
joke.

33:22.033 --> 33:24.467
Right, leave that. I'll do it.

33:24.533 --> 33:27.133
How is Sam going to iron out
all his issues

33:27.200 --> 33:29.733
when the little bitch
can't even iron a shirt?

33:29.800 --> 33:31.033
You twat.

33:35.067 --> 33:37.833
Why don't we go out tonight?
Cos we're all single,

33:37.900 --> 33:41.033
go pull some unreal lads.
Shall we just pull?

33:41.100 --> 33:42.300
Sam can fuck off.

33:42.367 --> 33:45.733
Me, Steph and Abbie are on the
pull.
I'm gonna make him jealous.

33:47.000 --> 33:50.000
All the girls are back together
and it feels so good.

33:50.067 --> 33:52.033
Cheers to the awesome foursome.

33:52.100 --> 33:53.967
(all cheer)

33:56.400 --> 33:59.900
His name's TJ. I might be able
to
get him to check out my
vajayjay.

34:02.467 --> 34:04.767
What the fuck is wrong with us?
I love drink.

34:09.233 --> 34:11.500
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

34:13.933 --> 34:14.132
.

34:16.667 --> 34:16.867
.

34:30.333 --> 34:32.833
(Sophie) Let's go out
and get fucking mortal.

34:32.900 --> 34:34.433
(all cheer)

34:34.500 --> 34:37.033
We have not got long left
in Tenerife.

34:37.100 --> 34:39.800
Tonight, we're going to make it
a good one.

34:41.100 --> 34:44.400
But I am not talking to Sam.
He's still pissed us off.

34:47.266 --> 34:50.367
We arrive at the club
and Tramps is absolutely
bouncing.

34:50.433 --> 34:53.333
I can't wait to get pissed
and get on that dance floor.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.567
I'm gonna try and get in
everybody's good books.

35:02.633 --> 35:04.467
The best way to do that...
shots.

35:08.600 --> 35:10.700
Everyone is buzzing for tonight.

35:10.767 --> 35:14.033
With Chloe and Sam, you could
cut the tension with a knife.

35:22.500 --> 35:25.833
I'm not one to hold grudges.
I do want to make friends with
Sam.

35:25.900 --> 35:28.767
I know what it's like to feel
the house is against you.

35:47.033 --> 35:49.400
If Chloe pulls tonight,
I'll be gutted.

35:49.467 --> 35:51.933
I obviously like her
way more than I realise.

35:55.433 --> 35:57.700
I know that Chloe wants to
make up with Sam.

35:57.767 --> 36:00.700
She doesn't want to make it
that easy for him. I get that.

36:07.367 --> 36:08.833
Thank God that's over.

36:08.900 --> 36:11.133
I want to get mortal
and have a good night.

36:27.900 --> 36:31.700
Chloe is trying to make Sam
jealous
and she's trying to make him
sweat.

36:31.767 --> 36:35.533
I hope she doesn't take it too
far
and her fuck everything up.

36:53.200 --> 36:55.400
I don't want to upset Chloe
any further.

36:55.467 --> 36:57.367
I'm going to say sorry to her.

36:57.433 --> 37:00.967
After that, whatever decision
she makes, it's on her toes.

37:04.833 --> 37:06.767
What is wrong with us? I love
drink.

37:09.100 --> 37:10.767
What the fuck is wrong with us?

37:11.967 --> 37:14.667
Give a lad a break.
I'm trying to make it up to you.

37:14.733 --> 37:17.633
What do you want?
A helicopter ride to the
Bahamas?

37:26.033 --> 37:28.333
Sam is saying all the right
things.

37:28.400 --> 37:31.300
I'm still going to play it cool
and pretend I don't care.

37:50.733 --> 37:53.833
I am going on the pull.
I don't want to, cos I like you.

37:53.900 --> 37:57.133
I want you to think that I am
going on the pull to piss you
off.

37:57.200 --> 37:58.867
Yeah. Yeah.

38:05.333 --> 38:07.867
That didn't go
as well as I hoped it to.

38:07.933 --> 38:09.067
Time to get mortal.

38:22.000 --> 38:26.667
We find some hats and sunglasses
and we think we're really sexy.

38:32.333 --> 38:35.067
There is slim pickings
in this crowd.

38:41.933 --> 38:45.300
Found a lad. His name is TJ.

38:45.367 --> 38:48.133
I might be able to get him
to check out my vajayjay.

38:53.600 --> 38:56.767
We've had so many lads in this
house
who get with a girl,

38:56.833 --> 38:58.367
break her heart, go pull.

38:58.433 --> 39:01.300
I'm not letting Sam
get away with this one.

39:27.633 --> 39:30.567
Aw, what a shame.
I haven't pulled tonight.

39:30.633 --> 39:33.633
Where's Sam when you need him?
Oh, there he is.

39:44.400 --> 39:49.000
Between me and you, I might have
missed her just a little bit.

39:49.067 --> 39:50.333
Don't tell nobody.

40:01.967 --> 40:05.200
I have put Sam through hell
today
by not speaking to him.

40:05.267 --> 40:07.467
I'm gonna put the lad
out of his misery.

40:15.533 --> 40:18.533
I'm so happy that me and Chloe
have got back on track.

40:18.600 --> 40:21.733
I'm looking forward to
picking up where we left off.

40:23.767 --> 40:27.500
I'm so happy my two favourite
thickies in this house

40:27.567 --> 40:28.933
are back together.

40:29.000 --> 40:30.833
Hopefully they'll stay that way

40:30.900 --> 40:33.500
and even sit next to each other
on the plane home.

40:45.600 --> 40:49.000
This disaster of a night has
ended up being a really good
night.

40:49.067 --> 40:50.433
Let's get out of here.

40:56.133 --> 40:59.533
Tonight has been wicked.
I'm absolutely mortal.

40:59.600 --> 41:02.100
I'm even bringing TJ back
to the villa with us.

41:08.533 --> 41:11.667
I am buzzing
that Steph has brought a boy
back.

41:11.733 --> 41:14.000
There is gonna be a race
for the Shag Pad.

41:18.633 --> 41:21.667
It's very apparent
I'm not gonna make it to my
house.

41:21.733 --> 41:24.733
Who the fuck's that?
Oh, my God, it's a new lad.

41:24.800 --> 41:26.233
I'm really confused.

41:26.300 --> 41:29.900
Steph has brought a boy back,
but she's not talking to him.

41:29.967 --> 41:31.433
Does she even like him?

41:31.500 --> 41:34.267
I think I'm going to go to bed,
you know.

41:34.333 --> 41:36.633
I'm having the worst night
of my life.

41:36.700 --> 41:38.433
The beer goggles have gone.

41:38.500 --> 41:40.967
Sexy Steph
is now Time For Bed Steph.

41:41.033 --> 41:44.000
Sorry, TJ.
You're gonna have to go home.

41:47.200 --> 41:50.700
Guys! I had to get rid of him.
I wasn't feeling it.

41:50.767 --> 41:54.200
When there's no fanny flutter,
the best thing to do is get rid.

41:54.267 --> 41:56.367
Besides,
she'd have more fun with us.

41:56.433 --> 42:01.967
Right now, it seems like you two
are in a very comfortable place.

42:02.033 --> 42:05.100
Yes, Nathan. Me and Sam
are in a very comfortable place.

42:05.167 --> 42:07.500
I'm sat on his lap
and I am very comfortable.

42:07.567 --> 42:12.100
I dare you to put every single
bit
of food that's on everyone's
plate

42:12.167 --> 42:13.567
in your mouth.

42:13.633 --> 42:16.733
Put it in, put it in. More!

42:16.800 --> 42:19.433
I do not want to play games
with you freaks.

42:19.500 --> 42:22.367
I'm gonna go off with Sam
to play some games of my own.

42:22.433 --> 42:25.767
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

42:28.600 --> 42:32.267
Going to the Shag Pad with Chloe
is
not how I expected tonight to
end.

42:32.333 --> 42:33.967
But I'm not complaining.

42:37.900 --> 42:40.067
Me and Sam
are sleeping in the Shag Pad.

42:40.133 --> 42:43.267
Nothing is going to happen
because I do not shag.

42:43.333 --> 42:44.933
(Chloe moans)

42:45.000 --> 42:46.400
Yet.

42:47.933 --> 42:50.700
I want to take you out.
On a little date.

42:50.767 --> 42:53.167
Have you ever been on a date
before?
No, never.

42:53.233 --> 42:55.200
No pressure. Hope it goes well.

42:55.267 --> 42:56.967
I don't like it, man!

42:57.033 --> 43:00.000
It's only right
that I pull myself a decent lad.

43:03.867 --> 43:05.333
(all cheer)

43:07.500 --> 43:08.800
Yes!

43:08.867 --> 43:11.400
You want to get me?
You want to get me?!

43:11.467 --> 43:12.733
Food fight!

43:12.800 --> 43:15.033
If you want to be
part of this family,

43:15.100 --> 43:17.267
then you get involved in the
fight!

43:20.433 --> 43:23.667
Why is Abbie cock-blocking us?
She needs to get the hint.

43:51.400 --> 43:51.600
.
