00:00.492 --> 00:01.952
Previously on The Tudors...

00:01.954 --> 00:04.495
Allow me to introduce my wife,
Queen Katherine.

00:04.496 --> 00:06.899
It seems incredible to have
obtained such a perfect jewel

00:06.900 --> 00:10.129
of womanhood who bears
towards me such perfect love.

00:10.130 --> 00:12.330
I urge Your Majesty
to be careful.

00:12.431 --> 00:13.697
What, Lady Rochford?

00:13.698 --> 00:15.979
Don't you think I know
how to meddle with a man?

00:16.667 --> 00:18.666
You hate my brother.

00:18.734 --> 00:20.974
If only you could be
more like him, Sir Thomas.

00:20.975 --> 00:23.783
My husband always
takes what he wants.

00:23.784 --> 00:26.100
It's him. It is him, isn't it?

00:26.101 --> 00:27.421
Mr. Francis Dereham.

00:27.422 --> 00:30.046
Surely you can understand why
I cannot offer you anything.

00:30.114 --> 00:32.659
- But you employed Joan Bulmer.
- I can't!

00:32.661 --> 00:35.667
Oh, but you can. Your Majesty.

00:35.668 --> 00:36.943
Her name is Katherine Howard,

00:36.944 --> 00:40.092
and I've known her a long time.
We used to be very close.

00:40.093 --> 00:42.115
Very close.

00:42.116 --> 00:44.860
Today I appointed a new
usher to my chambers.

00:44.861 --> 00:45.648
You don't mind?

00:45.649 --> 00:48.280
Of course not. I told you,
you must do as you will.

00:48.281 --> 00:50.369
Madam, your good health.

00:51.877 --> 00:53.487
I must see him.

00:53.488 --> 00:54.707
Who, Your Majesty?

00:54.708 --> 00:56.479
- Culpepper.
- My lady.

00:56.480 --> 00:58.709
Tell him to come when
the King is asleep.

00:58.776 --> 01:01.343
This Dereham,
you have to get rid of him.

01:01.445 --> 01:05.083
I will, I promise.
I told you, I love you.

01:05.084 --> 01:08.076
You must not be so familiar
with the Queen of England.

01:08.077 --> 01:11.197
The King ought to know how beggardely
his wife's servants treat her.

01:11.198 --> 01:14.114
Damn you Fell! Damn you!

01:14.115 --> 01:16.087
His Majesty wishes to thank God

01:16.154 --> 01:18.790
for blessing him with
so perfect a companion

01:18.858 --> 01:22.561
as Queen Katherine.
I render thanks to Thee, oh Lord-

01:22.662 --> 01:25.629
Thou hast been pleased
to give me a wife

01:25.630 --> 01:27.465
as her I now have.

02:51.824 --> 02:53.723
What does this letter say?

02:53.724 --> 02:55.020
I thought Your Majesty just read-

02:55.021 --> 02:56.889
I asked you to tell me
what this letter says,

02:56.890 --> 02:58.384
my Lord Hertford.

03:07.465 --> 03:10.647
The letter accuses Queen
Katherine of dissolute living

03:10.648 --> 03:12.571
before she was married
to Your Majesty,

03:12.572 --> 03:15.650
while she was living with the
Dowager Duchess of Norfolk.

03:16.923 --> 03:18.213
There was two men.

03:18.214 --> 03:21.177
A music teacher named Henry Manox,

03:21.278 --> 03:25.173
and a gentleman called
Francis Dereham.

03:25.174 --> 03:28.407
And that her way of
life was not a secret,

03:28.408 --> 03:30.603
that many knew of it.

03:31.801 --> 03:33.435
Who wrote the letter?

03:33.436 --> 03:34.668
It is not signed.

03:34.669 --> 03:36.558
Whoever left the letter
says he only wrote

03:36.559 --> 03:39.195
it because he did not have the
heart to tell you by mouth.

03:39.196 --> 03:40.815
It's a forgery!

03:40.816 --> 03:42.405
Yes, Your Majesty.

03:42.406 --> 03:45.683
The accusations in this letter
are maliciously intended.

03:45.684 --> 03:47.788
Many calumnies are published
about well-known persons,

03:47.789 --> 03:48.719
are they not?

03:48.720 --> 03:50.530
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Nevertheless, my Lord,

03:50.531 --> 03:52.948
I charge you to investigate
the matter thoroughly.

03:52.949 --> 03:55.701
Do not desist until you have
reached to the bottom of the pot.

03:55.702 --> 03:58.367
- Majesty.
- In the meantime, the Queen shall be confined

03:58.368 --> 04:01.274
to her apartments, with only
Lady Rochford in attendance-

04:01.342 --> 04:03.871
until her name is cleared.

04:03.872 --> 04:05.530
My Lord.

04:06.427 --> 04:08.123
Majesty.

04:16.158 --> 04:18.212
Your Majesty.

04:22.176 --> 04:24.364
No, the other hand.

04:34.205 --> 04:35.512
What?

04:39.870 --> 04:42.101
Sergeant? What is this?

04:42.102 --> 04:44.560
My Lady, you are confined
to your apartments,

04:44.561 --> 04:46.552
with only Lady
Rochford to attend you,

04:46.553 --> 04:48.746
for as long as it please the King.

04:51.359 --> 04:53.228
- No!
- Please, Katherine!

04:53.229 --> 04:54.814
- Joan!
- Don't let them take me!

04:54.881 --> 04:57.684
Joan! Joan!

04:58.532 --> 05:01.557
Why? Why must I stay here?

05:01.852 --> 05:04.788
Please tell me.
I don't understand.

05:04.789 --> 05:05.797
Forgive me, my Lady.

05:05.798 --> 05:08.852
But from now on there will be a
guard posted just beyond the door.

05:12.040 --> 05:13.797
Please.

05:19.482 --> 05:21.300
Francis Dereham,
you are under arrest.

05:21.301 --> 05:23.631
Under arrest for what?

05:23.632 --> 05:25.302
For what, I ask you?

05:32.425 --> 05:34.744
I want to ask you some questions

05:34.745 --> 05:36.646
about what went on,
some years ago,

05:36.747 --> 05:38.579
at Lambeth,

05:38.580 --> 05:40.748
between Katherine Howard,
as she then was,

05:40.749 --> 05:43.426
and two men:

05:43.427 --> 05:47.910
Henry Manox and Francis Dereham.

05:49.786 --> 05:52.087
You know what I'm talking
about, don't you?

06:05.269 --> 06:08.404
There's no need to be afraid,
Mistress Bulmer.

06:08.472 --> 06:11.159
No harm will come to you-

06:11.160 --> 06:13.112
so long as you tell me the truth!

06:13.890 --> 06:15.849
Is that clear?

06:17.635 --> 06:19.361
Yes, sir.

06:21.686 --> 06:23.294
I understand that this man,

06:23.295 --> 06:26.222
Henry Manox, was a music teacher?

06:26.712 --> 06:29.115
Did you ever see him

06:29.116 --> 06:32.908
or hear of him taking liberties
with Katherine Howard?

06:33.606 --> 06:38.331
Yes, sir. He told me
he was in love with her.

06:38.332 --> 06:40.123
I told him,

06:40.124 --> 06:42.772
I said if my lady of Norfolk
knew of the love between him

06:42.839 --> 06:44.348
and Mistress Howard,
she would undo him,

06:44.349 --> 06:47.523
because she is from a noble house,

06:47.524 --> 06:50.827
and if you marry her,
some of her blood will kill you.

06:50.828 --> 06:53.231
And what did Manox say?

06:53.232 --> 06:56.104
He said, "Hold your peace,
woman! My designs are

06:56.105 --> 07:00.639
"of a dishonest kind. I doubt
not I shall achieve my purpose."

07:03.376 --> 07:07.301
She said to him that he
would have her maidenhead,

07:07.302 --> 07:09.747
though it be painful to her,

07:09.748 --> 07:12.418
knowing he'd be good
to her afterwards.

07:12.486 --> 07:15.981
And did he-have her maidenhead?

07:16.094 --> 07:19.301
No, sir, for she started
seeing someone else.

07:21.562 --> 07:25.078
And would that man
be Francis Dereham?

07:30.072 --> 07:31.621
Yes, my Lord.

07:31.622 --> 07:33.703
Did you know Katherine
Howard at Lambeth,

07:33.704 --> 07:36.175
when she was 14 or 15 years old?

07:36.176 --> 07:37.554
Yes, sir.

07:38.009 --> 07:40.162
Did you have carnal
knowledge of her?

07:43.084 --> 07:46.738
We-played some games.

07:47.217 --> 07:49.762
We pretended to be man and wife.

07:49.763 --> 07:51.325
It amused her.

07:51.326 --> 07:53.790
Did you know her carnally?

07:55.071 --> 07:57.103
You should know, Mr. Dereham,

07:57.104 --> 07:58.562
that we have spoken
to some of the maids

07:58.563 --> 08:00.593
who used to sleep in
the same dormitory.

08:02.321 --> 08:04.134
They say that you crept
into the Queen's bed for

08:04.135 --> 08:06.183
a hundred nights or more.
She was not the Queen.

08:06.184 --> 08:08.385
Let me ask again.

08:08.909 --> 08:12.722
Did you have carnal knowledge
of Katherine Howard?

08:17.364 --> 08:19.143
No!

08:32.546 --> 08:36.852
I thought you were not altogether
honest with me, Mr. Dereham.

08:38.582 --> 08:42.289
I wanted to show you what we
do to people who are dishonest.

08:42.390 --> 08:45.025
Who don't tell the truth.

08:47.240 --> 08:50.214
I'll tell you the truth.

09:00.204 --> 09:02.678
Certain accusations have
been made against the Queen.

09:04.769 --> 09:06.601
What kind of accusations?

09:06.602 --> 09:10.089
Oh, that she was light,
immoral, dissolute...

09:10.849 --> 09:13.284
With certain men...

09:13.285 --> 09:15.986
Before she came to court.

09:20.966 --> 09:23.660
I can't believe it to be true.

09:23.661 --> 09:24.982
But since the
accusations are made,

09:24.983 --> 09:27.053
I must know all the facts.

09:29.065 --> 09:32.534
But since this inquisition
is in progress,

09:32.635 --> 09:34.903
be careful who you speak to.

09:34.971 --> 09:38.026
I'll have no spark of
scandal against her name.

09:38.027 --> 09:40.372
Yes, Your Majesty.

09:44.949 --> 09:47.818
I have a good hand.

09:52.075 --> 09:53.812
What do they know?

09:55.528 --> 09:58.394
Why have I been
confined like this?

09:58.953 --> 10:00.922
I don't know.

10:03.956 --> 10:06.724
Someone has told them something!

10:07.973 --> 10:09.675
Who?

10:10.475 --> 10:12.205
What has he told them?

10:12.965 --> 10:15.233
What has he told them?

10:20.661 --> 10:22.988
Why are you crying like this?

10:22.989 --> 10:25.471
It's not about you!

10:33.767 --> 10:36.001
I have to speak to him.

10:39.406 --> 10:42.071
I have to speak to the King.

10:42.810 --> 10:45.225
He'll understand.

10:50.818 --> 10:53.555
We have some evidence
that Katherine Howard gave

10:53.556 --> 10:57.243
you a gold chain and rich cap,
as a gift.

10:58.634 --> 11:01.515
Why did she buy you such gifts?

11:05.899 --> 11:07.581
Because she loved me.

11:07.582 --> 11:09.159
Loved you?

11:09.160 --> 11:11.307
Yes, my Lord.

11:11.308 --> 11:12.539
She told me: "I promise you

11:12.540 --> 11:14.899
"I do love you with all my heart."

11:16.978 --> 11:19.266
She promised by her
faith and troth

11:19.267 --> 11:21.427
that she would take no
other husband but me.

11:21.428 --> 11:23.303
You were pre-contracted then?

11:23.304 --> 11:25.002
Yes, sir.

11:25.505 --> 11:28.308
It was understood between us
that we would get married.

11:29.391 --> 11:31.153
That's why...

11:32.155 --> 11:34.722
That's why you
knew her carnally?

11:35.843 --> 11:37.694
Yes, sir.

11:37.695 --> 11:39.306
We didn't think we were
doing anything wrong.

11:39.307 --> 11:41.708
She was going to be my
wife and I her husband.

11:43.086 --> 11:44.843
We'd made promises before God.

11:44.844 --> 11:46.873
Why did you not marry her, then?

11:48.746 --> 11:52.482
I left Lambeth for a
while and went to Ireland.

11:53.451 --> 11:56.357
When I returned,
Katherine was already at court.

11:56.358 --> 11:59.864
The Queen recently took you
back into her employment.

11:59.865 --> 12:01.758
On what grounds?

12:02.422 --> 12:06.864
The Dowager Duchess was kind enough
to speak highly of my talents.

12:06.965 --> 12:09.686
You have admitted to the fact
that you had carnal knowledge

12:09.687 --> 12:12.005
of the Queen before her
marriage to the King.

12:12.006 --> 12:14.645
But did you also know
her carnally afterwards?

12:14.646 --> 12:17.206
No, sir! No! On my honour!

12:17.207 --> 12:20.391
On your honour, Mr. Dereham?

12:28.539 --> 12:30.250
My Lady?

12:30.251 --> 12:32.479
His Excellency is here.

12:39.332 --> 12:42.070
Eustace! Please, sit.

12:42.071 --> 12:43.646
Thank you, Lady Mary.

12:43.647 --> 12:45.240
You are too gracious.

12:48.354 --> 12:50.181
I had to see you.

12:51.909 --> 12:54.370
There are many rumours at court.

12:54.371 --> 12:57.611
And it seems the Queen has been
confined to her apartments.

12:57.612 --> 12:58.484
Why?

12:58.485 --> 13:02.909
Nobody knows. But the rumours
speak of her misconduct.

13:02.910 --> 13:04.675
I knew it.

13:04.676 --> 13:06.466
I knew she was always
a light young woman,

13:06.467 --> 13:08.414
dedicated only to pleasure.

13:08.415 --> 13:09.930
And the sad fact is, Lady Mary,

13:09.931 --> 13:12.638
that the Howards are a
great Catholic family.

13:12.639 --> 13:14.668
No, Eustace,

13:14.669 --> 13:17.028
the sad fact is that
Katherine Howard was never

13:17.029 --> 13:20.716
a good Catholic,
nor ever a good wife.

13:20.717 --> 13:23.547
Nor even less a Queen!

13:24.385 --> 13:26.267
What have you discovered?

13:26.268 --> 13:29.578
Katherine Howard was
a loose young woman.

13:29.579 --> 13:32.414
You surely knew that!

13:32.482 --> 13:35.851
I was told that her upbringing
had been unconventional.

13:35.952 --> 13:37.819
I didn't know how unconventional.

13:37.887 --> 13:39.576
I didn't suspect that
at fourteen years old

13:39.577 --> 13:40.981
she was sleeping
with two older men!

13:40.982 --> 13:43.285
You met her!

13:43.286 --> 13:47.267
You saw the look in her eyes.
She was never innocent.

13:47.268 --> 13:50.673
And who is innocent,
my sweetheart?

13:52.752 --> 13:55.102
What did Dereham confess?

13:55.103 --> 13:58.829
Only that he'd slept with the
Queen before she was married.

13:58.869 --> 14:00.644
Do you believe him?

14:00.645 --> 14:04.191
I don't know. I may ask again.

14:08.918 --> 14:11.786
Husband, you must be careful.

14:11.787 --> 14:14.111
If you remember,
you were among those

14:14.112 --> 14:15.973
who offered Katherine
Howard up to the King.

14:15.974 --> 14:18.591
Do you suppose I ever forget that?

14:18.592 --> 14:21.930
But that's why I must be
harder on her than anyone else.

14:21.998 --> 14:24.599
Since I was the most deceived.

14:26.267 --> 14:28.600
I must to bed. I have
things to do in the morning.

14:28.601 --> 14:33.192
I bid thee, all three of thee,
good night.

14:33.193 --> 14:35.141
Good night, brother.

14:41.017 --> 14:43.540
So...

14:44.767 --> 14:48.315
What shall we call
your child, Thomas?

15:01.518 --> 15:03.419
Sir Edward-

15:04.465 --> 15:06.026
can you not tell me
what's happening?

15:06.027 --> 15:08.192
I beg you.
No one tells me anything.

15:08.193 --> 15:11.557
Please... please... - Madam,
I am forbidden to talk to you.

15:11.558 --> 15:13.722
No, no. You must speak to me.

15:13.723 --> 15:15.432
Madam, I can't... On my life!

15:15.533 --> 15:17.634
Just something!

15:17.635 --> 15:19.669
Why am I confined here?

15:19.670 --> 15:21.704
What has anyone said?

15:27.141 --> 15:29.979
They have taken
Dereham to the Tower.

15:29.980 --> 15:34.070
Also some of the maids who
attended the Dowager Duchess.

15:34.894 --> 15:38.019
Oh... my God.

15:38.020 --> 15:40.290
That's all I know.

15:41.524 --> 15:42.890
Now, Madam, you will
have to excuse me.

15:42.891 --> 15:45.325
I can say no more.

15:53.601 --> 15:55.922
His Majesty the King.

15:56.394 --> 15:57.537
Your Majesty.

15:57.538 --> 16:00.541
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

16:27.935 --> 16:30.132
Your Grace?

16:31.678 --> 16:34.147
Your Majesty,

16:34.148 --> 16:37.075
my Lord Hertford,
and other Councillors,

16:37.076 --> 16:39.892
have made diligent inquiries

16:39.893 --> 16:44.438
into the question of the
misconduct of the Queen.

16:44.966 --> 16:46.375
And?

16:46.376 --> 16:48.572
Your Majesty-

16:49.676 --> 16:51.491
I have to tell Your Majesty that,

16:51.492 --> 16:54.997
even from my preliminary
investigations,

16:54.998 --> 16:57.872
we believe the allegations
against Queen Katherine

16:57.873 --> 17:00.851
have a sound basis in fact...

17:01.996 --> 17:04.893
The Queen received the
attentions of her music master,

17:04.894 --> 17:08.990
Henry Manox, when she lived with
the Dowager Duchess of Norfolk.

17:08.991 --> 17:14.138
Manox swears under oath that she
never gave him her maidenhead...

17:14.140 --> 17:18.923
But that instead it was given
to a man called Francis Dereham.

17:19.980 --> 17:23.758
There is ample proof that they
spent many nights together...

17:23.759 --> 17:25.856
Naked.

17:29.190 --> 17:32.148
Dereham claims that he was
pre-contracted to the Queen,

17:32.149 --> 17:35.792
so he did no wrong by having
carnal relations with her,

17:35.793 --> 17:37.924
and that their relationship
was over when he left

17:37.925 --> 17:41.682
for Ireland and the Queen
for Your Majesty's court.

17:43.742 --> 17:46.143
Unfortunately...

17:46.144 --> 17:49.188
Queen Katherine took
this same Dereham

17:49.189 --> 17:53.134
back into her employment during
Your Majesty's late progress,

17:53.135 --> 17:58.536
appointing him her personal
secretary and usher.

18:01.062 --> 18:04.570
I have to say that she has
betrayed you in thought-

18:04.571 --> 18:07.187
and if she had an opportunity-

18:07.188 --> 18:09.884
would have betrayed you in deed.

18:30.357 --> 18:32.093
My Lady.

18:32.094 --> 18:34.466
Sir Thomas?

18:35.266 --> 18:36.960
What is it?

18:36.961 --> 18:39.445
Madam, I have come
to tell you that

18:39.446 --> 18:41.377
for your offences
against the King,

18:41.378 --> 18:43.816
all your household
has been discharged.

18:43.817 --> 18:47.544
Your coffers and chests will be
sealed and placed under guard,

18:47.545 --> 18:50.105
and I am also come here
to collect all your jewels

18:50.106 --> 18:52.091
and return them to His Majesty.

18:52.092 --> 18:53.540
Please, Sir Thomas-
Everything in here is-

18:53.541 --> 18:56.583
-where is the King? I must see him.

18:56.584 --> 18:59.335
Madam, I must tell you
that the King and his Council

18:59.336 --> 19:02.345
have ordained that,
for your offences,

19:02.346 --> 19:04.141
you have forfeited
the title of Queen,

19:04.142 --> 19:07.342
and must be known as
Lady Katherine Howard.

19:07.343 --> 19:09.279
You will be taken
to Syon Abbey today,

19:09.346 --> 19:11.281
to wait upon the King's
further pleasure.

19:11.382 --> 19:13.235
Where is the King?

19:13.236 --> 19:15.751
I need to speak to him.

19:15.752 --> 19:19.692
You don't understand.
I have to speak to him.

19:19.693 --> 19:22.594
Then everything will be all right.

19:22.595 --> 19:25.826
Don't you understand?
Everything will be all right.

19:25.827 --> 19:28.636
His Majesty is at Chapel.

19:29.033 --> 19:31.574
But I fear he will
not speak to you.

19:41.240 --> 19:42.813
Lady Katherine!

19:42.914 --> 19:46.917
Stop her! Guards!
Katherine Howard! Stop!

19:46.984 --> 19:49.386
Katherine Howard! Stop!
You are arrested.

19:49.487 --> 19:51.756
Stop! Do not proceed!

19:51.857 --> 19:53.724
Katherine Howard! - Your Majesty!

19:53.825 --> 19:57.628
I must speak to you.
Please, please, Your Majesty!

19:57.696 --> 20:01.365
Please, it's me-Katherine!
It's Katherine.

20:01.467 --> 20:05.563
It's Katherine. Please. Please.

20:05.564 --> 20:08.006
Henry! Henry, please!

20:08.107 --> 20:10.574
No! Your Majesty!

20:10.575 --> 20:12.035
No, please!

20:12.036 --> 20:16.281
Henry! No, please! Please, Henry!

20:16.282 --> 20:18.565
Please!

20:22.762 --> 20:26.355
Risley. Risley!

20:27.043 --> 20:28.133
Majesty.

20:28.134 --> 20:30.292
Go and fetch Bishop Gardiner.

20:30.293 --> 20:33.572
I must speak to him.
Yes, Your Majesty.

20:43.490 --> 20:45.323
Why are you doing this?

20:45.324 --> 20:49.141
Why are you doing this?
I've already told you everything I know!

20:49.261 --> 20:52.096
His hands, my loves. His hands.

20:52.164 --> 20:55.233
What are you going
to do to me? No! No!

20:55.334 --> 20:58.403
No! No! No!

20:59.009 --> 21:00.939
NO!

21:01.149 --> 21:03.041
Your Grace.

21:05.660 --> 21:07.780
I must warn Your Grace-

21:07.848 --> 21:11.476
-that the poor creature,
ever since she came here,

21:11.477 --> 21:14.021
has been in such
lamentation and heaviness

21:14.088 --> 21:16.734
that I never saw in any creature.

21:17.639 --> 21:19.868
Sometimes in a frenzy, that I had

21:19.869 --> 21:23.021
to remove every implement
that might have harmed her.

21:26.700 --> 21:29.543
Lady Katherine!

21:33.068 --> 21:37.091
Lady Katherine! Bishop
Gardiner is come to see you.

21:40.294 --> 21:42.128
Lady Katherine?

21:48.018 --> 21:50.619
Lady Katherine, do not weep,

21:50.721 --> 21:54.183
for I am come here with a
letter from His Majesty

21:54.184 --> 21:57.443
which offers you his
most gracious mercy.

22:00.819 --> 22:03.964
Madam, the King offers you mercy.

22:09.347 --> 22:12.272
What?

22:12.340 --> 22:14.273
What did you say?

22:14.341 --> 22:17.344
Here is His Majesty's letter.

22:17.445 --> 22:21.828
In it, he offers you mercy,

22:21.829 --> 22:28.088
despite the- uh-grievous offences
you have committed against him,

22:28.190 --> 22:32.632
if you will only openly
confess your faults.

22:32.633 --> 22:35.402
There. You see?

22:36.861 --> 22:39.534
I humbly thank the King,

22:39.601 --> 22:42.553
who has shown me
more grace and mercy

22:42.554 --> 22:45.059
than I could have hoped for.

22:45.554 --> 22:49.463
But, first, I must
ask you some questions.

22:49.464 --> 22:54.300
And you must answer as
truthfully and honestly

22:54.301 --> 22:58.093
as you will reply at
the Day of Judgment.

23:07.116 --> 23:08.883
Katherine!

23:08.884 --> 23:12.520
The King offers his hand in mercy.

23:12.521 --> 23:15.776
There is nothing to
be frightened of.

23:15.777 --> 23:18.812
Come. Come! Sit down.

23:38.225 --> 23:43.315
Alas, my Lord, that I am alive!

23:46.433 --> 23:49.035
The fear of death does
not grieve me as much

23:49.036 --> 23:52.928
as the remembrance of
the King's goodness,

23:54.501 --> 23:59.444
for when I remember how
gracious and loving a Prince

23:59.445 --> 24:03.517
I had, I cannot but sorrow.

24:07.586 --> 24:11.155
But this sudden mercy,

24:11.223 --> 24:13.557
more than I could have looked for,

24:13.658 --> 24:16.252
makes my offences
appear to my eyes

24:16.253 --> 24:18.760
more heinous than they did before.

24:40.418 --> 24:44.989
You confess that this
Francis Dereham came

24:45.057 --> 24:47.715
often to your bed at Lambeth?

24:48.809 --> 24:52.364
Yes, my Lord.
He has lain with me,

24:52.432 --> 24:56.220
sometimes in his doublet and hose,
and sometimes naked,

24:57.320 --> 24:59.370
but I mean, not so naked

24:59.371 --> 25:01.839
that he had nothing upon him,
for he had always

25:01.940 --> 25:04.513
his doublet on; but I mean

25:04.514 --> 25:07.831
naked when his hose
was pulled down.

25:07.832 --> 25:10.608
In order to know you carnally?

25:14.536 --> 25:18.094
Was there a pre-contract
between you?

25:18.591 --> 25:21.119
Did you intend to marry him?

25:22.793 --> 25:25.942
He sometimes called me
"wife" when we were together,

25:25.943 --> 25:29.111
and I called him "husband."

25:29.112 --> 25:31.669
Still-I think it was no contract.

25:31.736 --> 25:34.105
If there was a contract,

25:34.206 --> 25:37.208
then your marriage to the
King would be invalid-

25:37.276 --> 25:39.867
you might face shame...

25:39.868 --> 25:42.891
But you would not
forfeit your life.

25:45.517 --> 25:48.811
He promised to love
me with all his heart...

25:49.955 --> 25:53.547
But I think it was no contract.

25:56.296 --> 25:58.230
Did Dereham have
carnal knowledge

25:58.231 --> 26:02.108
of you after you became Queen?

26:02.474 --> 26:05.265
No, my Lord. He never did.

26:09.167 --> 26:13.406
I will go back
to London and draft

26:13.407 --> 26:17.240
a plea of forgiveness for
you to submit to the King.

26:22.160 --> 26:23.726
Wait!

26:23.727 --> 26:26.672
I have important things to say.

26:27.269 --> 26:29.736
My Lady?

26:29.737 --> 26:33.448
I never consented to
sex with Francis Dereham.

26:33.449 --> 26:38.745
He used importunate
force against me.

26:38.846 --> 26:43.462
In a manner-violence.

26:44.378 --> 26:46.854
He raped you?

26:52.195 --> 26:53.605
The Queen confessed?

26:53.606 --> 26:57.879
Yes. She told me
that Dereham raped her.

26:57.880 --> 26:59.068
I'm sure she was lying as

26:59.069 --> 27:01.097
I'm sure she's lying
about other things too.

27:01.098 --> 27:04.641
But I do believe that there
was some form of pre-contract

27:04.642 --> 27:08.604
between them, which would
invalidate the marriage.

27:08.605 --> 27:11.392
And she claims to be
innocent after the marriage?

27:11.393 --> 27:12.977
Of course.

27:12.978 --> 27:14.539
And you believed that?

27:14.540 --> 27:16.663
You don't believe it?

27:17.444 --> 27:20.250
I don't believe
anything Dereham says.

27:21.250 --> 27:24.053
It might not be Dereham.

27:24.737 --> 27:26.707
Why does Your Grace say that?

27:26.708 --> 27:28.685
You have the Queen's confession?

27:29.931 --> 27:32.633
Yes, Your Majesty.

27:32.734 --> 27:35.636
The Queen begs for mercy.

27:35.704 --> 27:39.005
She confesses that she was
so desirous to be taken

27:39.006 --> 27:42.243
into Your Grace's favour,
so blinded

27:42.244 --> 27:44.414
by desire for worldly glory,

27:44.415 --> 27:47.222
that she did not consider
how great a fault it was

27:47.223 --> 27:51.617
to conceal her former
faults from Your Majesty.

27:51.718 --> 27:55.347
"Considering that I intended

27:55.348 --> 27:57.347
"ever during my life

27:57.348 --> 28:00.161
"to be faithful and
true to Your Majesty."

28:00.658 --> 28:02.481
Then we can proceed
with the annulment?

28:02.482 --> 28:06.087
I think it would be best,
Your Majesty.

28:06.088 --> 28:08.681
I don't believe that you
didn't have carnal knowledge

28:08.682 --> 28:10.762
of the Queen after her
marriage to the King.

28:10.763 --> 28:14.275
Please don't! It is the truth-

28:14.376 --> 28:17.525
because someone else had
succeeded me in her affections.

28:20.677 --> 28:22.932
Who?

28:23.806 --> 28:25.291
WHO?

28:28.562 --> 28:30.604
Thomas Culpepper.

28:31.750 --> 28:34.310
Thomas Culpepper?

28:34.311 --> 28:36.484
The King's groom?

28:38.373 --> 28:40.315
Yes, sir.

28:44.125 --> 28:47.822
How well did you know this man,
Thomas Culpepper?

28:48.100 --> 28:51.581
Quite well. I flirted with him

28:51.582 --> 28:55.915
and met him sometimes by the back stairs,
and gave him gifts.

28:55.983 --> 28:58.701
He called me his "
sweet little fool."

29:01.823 --> 29:05.760
And did you commit
adultery with him?

29:10.087 --> 29:12.799
No, my Lord. I never did-

29:14.160 --> 29:18.780
although Lady Rochford
encouraged me to do so.

29:22.079 --> 29:25.214
Lady Rochford encouraged you?

29:25.315 --> 29:27.684
Yes, she did.

29:27.785 --> 29:30.386
And then she spread a vile rumour

29:30.487 --> 29:33.190
that we were lovers,
which we never were.

29:33.191 --> 29:35.553
You don't deny that
you met with the Queen

29:35.554 --> 29:38.460
in secret on many occasions?
No, my Lord.

29:38.461 --> 29:41.062
But you deny that you ever
committed adultery with her?

29:41.063 --> 29:44.967
I do. We never
passed beyond words.

29:46.235 --> 29:49.277
If you don't tell me the truth,
Mr. Culpepper,

29:49.278 --> 29:51.456
you will be tortured till you do.

29:51.457 --> 29:53.914
I'm telling you the truth.

29:53.915 --> 29:56.020
Which isn't to say I
didn't want to go further!

29:56.021 --> 29:59.706
I intended and meant to do so
with the Queen, and she with me.

30:01.827 --> 30:03.643
My God.

30:03.644 --> 30:07.724
That evil intent in itself
constitutes high treason.

30:09.458 --> 30:14.097
But it was Katherine
who led me on!

30:14.098 --> 30:16.308
She wanted it, not me.

30:17.251 --> 30:20.357
And her servant, Lady Rochford,
she provoked it

30:20.358 --> 30:24.614
and acted as a procuress,
like some madam in a brothel!

30:24.911 --> 30:28.276
Why are they blaming me?
It's not my fault.

30:28.842 --> 30:31.985
I had to stand guard when they
met in the Queen's chambers,

30:31.986 --> 30:34.769
or even her stool closet.

30:34.770 --> 30:37.180
I didn't want to.

30:37.181 --> 30:39.811
I didn't like doing it.

30:41.578 --> 30:45.171
Once I even had to stop the King
coming into the Queen's bedchamber,

30:45.172 --> 30:48.405
because Culpepper
was already there.

30:50.386 --> 30:53.729
Do you think they had carnal
knowledge at those times?

30:55.738 --> 30:58.068
I cannot think it otherwise,

30:58.069 --> 31:02.374
considering all the things I
heard and saw between them.

31:07.167 --> 31:08.840
Guard!

31:11.510 --> 31:14.337
Do you think I shall die,
my Lord?

31:15.889 --> 31:18.729
Do you think I shall die?

31:21.486 --> 31:23.550
Constable! Open up!

31:27.961 --> 31:31.008
Your Majesty asked me at the
beginning of this investigation

31:31.009 --> 31:35.129
not to desist until I had got
to the bottom of the pot.

31:39.477 --> 31:44.541
Majesty, I fear to say that I
am already scraping the bottom,

31:45.475 --> 31:48.619
and a good companion
of Your Majesty,

31:48.620 --> 31:50.890
a fellow of trust,

31:50.891 --> 31:54.704
seems certain to have
betrayed Your Majesty-

31:54.705 --> 31:58.641
committing adultery with
the Queen, your wife.

32:02.277 --> 32:04.017
Who is he?

32:06.712 --> 32:09.778
Your groom, Thomas Culpepper.

32:15.626 --> 32:19.906
So far, both of them
have denied the charges,

32:19.907 --> 32:22.964
though neither of them denies
the many illicit meetings

32:22.965 --> 32:25.971
they had on the backstairs and
in the Queen's stool closet

32:25.972 --> 32:28.622
during Your Majesty's
last progress.

32:30.573 --> 32:33.865
Lady Rochford and other
maids of Her Majesty have

32:33.866 --> 32:37.295
come forward with
corroborating evidence

32:37.296 --> 32:40.416
of their frequent intimacies.

32:43.370 --> 32:48.990
Finally, this letter was discovered in Mr.
Culpepper's chambers.

32:49.582 --> 32:52.424
It is the Queen's handwriting.

32:53.831 --> 32:55.749
She writes:

32:55.750 --> 32:58.504
"It makes my heart die to think

32:58.505 --> 33:01.009
"I cannot always be
in your company."

33:01.010 --> 33:04.236
And, "I heard that you were
sick and never longed so much

33:04.237 --> 33:07.302
for anything as to see you."

33:09.635 --> 33:11.728
And it is signed:

33:11.729 --> 33:14.712
"Yours as long as life endures

33:14.713 --> 33:17.211
"-Katherine."

33:19.797 --> 33:23.269
What has happened is your fault!

33:23.270 --> 33:24.896
Your fault!

33:24.897 --> 33:27.793
You solicited me to marry her!

33:30.110 --> 33:34.399
How misfortunate I am to have had
so many ill-conditioned wives!

33:34.400 --> 33:37.641
I vow that any pleasure
that wicked bitch got from

33:37.642 --> 33:40.501
her wantonness will
be nothing-nothing-

33:40.502 --> 33:43.177
in comparison to the
pain she going to feel

33:43.178 --> 33:45.954
at the hand of my torturer!

34:02.006 --> 34:06.497
Well done, wife.
What shall we call him?

34:08.565 --> 34:11.270
Thomas.

34:12.467 --> 34:16.083
Very well. Thomas he is.

34:25.936 --> 34:28.884
You want to ask Lady
Rochford some more questions?

34:28.885 --> 34:32.071
- Yes.
- There's no point, Sir Thomas.

34:32.072 --> 34:35.123
Lady Rochford has gone mad.

34:36.149 --> 34:38.277
Death to you!

34:43.964 --> 34:46.612
There you are.

34:55.704 --> 35:00.411
Majesty? His Grace,
the Duke of Suffolk.

35:02.757 --> 35:05.740
You've never read the Bible,
have you, Charles?

35:05.741 --> 35:09.488
No, Your Majesty.
I've always allowed others,

35:09.489 --> 35:13.051
with more knowledge than I,
to read it for me.

35:13.342 --> 35:16.088
In that case, you've missed
many great sayings and truths,

35:16.089 --> 35:19.524
Like this one here in the Book
of Solomon, where it says:

35:19.525 --> 35:23.883
"The lips of a harlot are
"a dropping honeycomb.

35:23.884 --> 35:27.878
"Her throat is softer than oil.

35:28.828 --> 35:30.880
"Yet in the end,

35:30.881 --> 35:33.422
"she is as bitter as wormwood,

35:33.423 --> 35:36.141
and as sharp as a
double-edged sword."

35:36.142 --> 35:37.995
Why have you come?

35:39.955 --> 35:42.008
King Francis has
sent you a letter.

35:42.009 --> 35:44.138
What does it say?

35:51.409 --> 35:54.326
"I am sorry to hear of the displeasure
and trouble which has been

35:54.327 --> 35:59.149
caused "by the lewd and naughty
behaviour of the Queen.

36:01.456 --> 36:03.952
"But knowing my good brother
to be a prince of prudence,"

36:03.953 --> 36:05.811
virtue, and honour,

36:05.812 --> 36:08.596
"I do require him to throw
off the said displeasure

36:08.597 --> 36:12.890
"and wisely, temperately,
like myself,

36:12.891 --> 36:16.037
"not reputing his honour to rest
in the lightness of a woman,

36:16.038 --> 36:17.543
"but to thank God of all,

36:17.544 --> 36:19.825
"comforting himself
in God's goodness.

36:19.826 --> 36:24.961
"The lightness of women cannot
bend the honour of men."

36:24.962 --> 36:27.003
You tell Francis to go-

36:30.136 --> 36:31.832
Tell His Majesty

36:31.833 --> 36:35.114
that we are grateful
for his solicitations.

36:35.115 --> 36:36.601
Yes, Your Majesty.

36:36.602 --> 36:37.800
What of Dereham and Culpepper?

36:37.801 --> 36:39.363
Have they been
arraigned for treason?

36:39.364 --> 36:41.539
They were tried together.

36:41.540 --> 36:45.557
At the last moment, Culpepper
changed his plea to guilty,

36:45.558 --> 36:48.079
but both were found so.

36:48.080 --> 36:52.642
They are due to be hanged,
drawn and quartered together at Tyburn.

36:53.300 --> 36:56.575
Tell the judge to commute
Culpepper's sentencing to beheading.

36:57.600 --> 36:59.841
I hate Dereham more,

36:59.842 --> 37:02.624
since he spoiled the Queen for me.

37:03.604 --> 37:07.147
Now, what of Lady Rochford?

37:07.655 --> 37:12.062
She has been found guilty
of misprision and treason-

37:12.848 --> 37:15.342
but, since she is insane,

37:15.343 --> 37:18.169
she cannot be executed.

37:19.852 --> 37:22.835
You tell Richard Rich to
pass a bill in Parliament

37:22.836 --> 37:26.218
making it legal to execute
an insane person for treason.

37:26.219 --> 37:28.256
Do you hear?

37:31.113 --> 37:33.811
Yes, Your Majesty.

37:44.403 --> 37:46.713
You were one of those who placed
Katherine Howard in front of me.

37:46.714 --> 37:49.273
Were you not, your Grace?

37:51.169 --> 37:53.879
Any regrets?

37:57.684 --> 37:59.637
Charles.

38:01.112 --> 38:03.647
Majesty.

38:45.404 --> 38:48.213
You should be
ashamed of yourselves!

38:49.853 --> 38:51.654
Traitor!

38:51.783 --> 38:53.531
"Master Culpepper,

38:53.532 --> 38:56.315
"I heartily recommend me unto you,

38:56.316 --> 38:59.622
"praying you to send me
word how that you do.

38:59.623 --> 39:01.596
"I heard that you were sick,

39:01.597 --> 39:05.854
"and never longed so much
for anything as to see you.

39:08.308 --> 39:10.948
"I would you were with
me now that you might see

39:10.949 --> 39:14.107
"what pain I take
in writing to you.

39:15.383 --> 39:18.096
"It makes my heart die to think

39:18.097 --> 39:21.644
"I cannot always be
in your company."

39:31.663 --> 39:34.586
I beg you all to pray for me.

39:51.341 --> 39:53.124
"He, Dereham,

39:53.125 --> 39:56.173
"gave me lots of lovers' tokens.

39:56.174 --> 39:59.129
"He knew a little woman in
London with a crooked back,

39:59.130 --> 40:02.368
"who was skilled in
making flowers of silk,

40:02.369 --> 40:06.363
"who made for him a French
fennel to give to me.

40:06.364 --> 40:09.768
"And later, a heart's ease
for a New Year's present,

40:09.769 --> 40:13.165
"and some sarcenet,
which I had made into a quilted cap.

40:15.717 --> 40:17.999
"He called me "wife,"

40:18.000 --> 40:21.688
"and touched the secret
parts of my body.

40:32.283 --> 40:36.310
"I remember I gave him a
collar and sleeves for a shirt.

40:37.443 --> 40:38.715
"And one day,

40:38.716 --> 40:41.662
"he snatched a silver
bracelet from me and kept it,

40:41.663 --> 40:44.619
"saying, 'Here, wife,
"'a gift for me.'

40:45.339 --> 40:49.330
"And he kissed me often
and so passionately

40:49.331 --> 40:53.532
"that everyone said he would
never have kissed me enough."

41:21.382 --> 41:23.814
No!

41:27.536 --> 41:29.200
No!

41:58.468 --> 42:00.315
Katherine Howard,

42:00.316 --> 42:02.669
you are indicted for
having led an abominable,

42:02.670 --> 42:05.597
base, carnal, voluptuous,

42:05.598 --> 42:09.705
and vicious life before
marriage like a common harlot-

42:09.706 --> 42:11.337
with several persons.

42:11.338 --> 42:13.688
You led the King by word
and gesture to love you,

42:13.689 --> 42:16.062
concealing your contract
with Francis Dereham

42:16.063 --> 42:20.113
to the peril of the King and
his children begotten by you.

42:20.704 --> 42:22.033
And after marriage,

42:22.034 --> 42:25.499
you showed the same
Dereham notable favour,

42:25.500 --> 42:30.754
while inciting Thomas
Culpepper to carnal knowledge,

42:30.755 --> 42:32.561
telling him

42:33.273 --> 42:35.673
you loved him above the King.

42:39.487 --> 42:41.643
It is my duty

42:41.644 --> 42:44.651
to escort you to the Tower.

42:50.666 --> 42:52.404
My Lady.

42:55.524 --> 42:57.676
Sir Edward.

42:57.677 --> 43:00.190
Don't let them.

43:12.565 --> 43:13.724
No.

43:43.477 --> 43:45.038
Thomas?

43:45.645 --> 43:49.210
Oh God!

43:50.906 --> 43:53.478
Oh, Thomas!

43:53.479 --> 43:56.667
- My Lady.
- No, no, no, no!

43:56.668 --> 44:01.050
No, no! No, No! No, Thomas!

44:07.419 --> 44:09.210
Is she condemned?

44:09.211 --> 44:11.043
Yes, Your Majesty.

44:11.726 --> 44:13.973
What of the others?

44:13.974 --> 44:17.079
Dereham and Culpepper
have been executed

44:17.080 --> 44:20.563
and the bill allowing a
mad person to be executed

44:20.564 --> 44:23.154
for treason has become law.

44:28.884 --> 44:30.902
I want to have a party.

44:31.833 --> 44:33.110
Here is a list of guests.

44:33.111 --> 44:35.071
Yes, Your Majesty.

45:19.341 --> 45:22.308
Katherine Howard, I have to tell
you that you are going to die.

45:22.963 --> 45:25.125
You will be taken to your place
of execution tomorrow morning,

45:25.126 --> 45:28.926
the 13th of February, escorted
by members of the Privy Council.

45:35.241 --> 45:37.459
May I ask one favour?

45:40.585 --> 45:44.153
Will you bring the block to me-

45:44.154 --> 45:47.034
so that I might know
how to place myself

45:47.035 --> 45:51.670
and... make trial of it?

45:51.671 --> 45:54.598
As you wish.

45:54.599 --> 45:56.931
Is there anything else you need?

45:56.932 --> 45:59.109
Do you want a confessor?

46:00.919 --> 46:02.486
No.

46:03.684 --> 46:05.954
I have spoken to God so rarely,

46:05.955 --> 46:09.508
I did not think He
would know who I was.

46:32.411 --> 46:34.846
Ladies.

46:59.224 --> 47:01.577
Something sweet?

47:19.142 --> 47:22.445
What do you think? - Your Majesty.

47:29.354 --> 47:32.347
Ah! A beautiful Queen.

49:34.667 --> 49:37.723
Madam. - Do you want
to say a few words?

49:42.388 --> 49:48.673
I ask forgiveness for my sins,

49:49.408 --> 49:53.144
from His Gracious Majesty,

49:54.173 --> 49:56.645
from God,

49:57.334 --> 50:01.753
and from all of you.

50:07.681 --> 50:09.351
Shall I say more?

50:09.352 --> 50:12.926
No, my Lady.
That is already sufficient.

50:14.301 --> 50:16.512
Thank you.

51:29.703 --> 51:31.931
It's time, my Lady.

51:49.507 --> 51:52.522
I have come here to die.

51:52.523 --> 51:54.170
Oh, my Lady!

51:56.003 --> 51:58.549
I die a Queen.

51:59.240 --> 52:03.951
But I would rather die
the wife of Culpepper...

52:27.583 --> 52:33.206
Life is very beautiful.
