<i>I'm so sorry, Skye.</i>

00:45.488 --> 00:49.289
The tumor just hasn't
responded to the treatment.

00:49.291 --> 00:52.393
Pretty soon you'll feel your
energy levels drop dramatically,

00:52.395 --> 00:56.797
and your mobility will become
increasingly restricted.

00:56.799 --> 01:00.670
I'm afraid it's about
quality of time now.

01:04.572 --> 01:05.973
Win some, you lose some.

03:16.067 --> 03:17.700
What's eating Calvin?

03:17.702 --> 03:19.737
He gets his test
results tomorrow.

03:22.673 --> 03:24.439
Saw you checking out
those Ray-Bans.

03:24.441 --> 03:25.874
Right.

03:25.876 --> 03:28.077
Why do all pilots think
that they're rock stars?

03:28.079 --> 03:30.779
I heard he wears 'em to bed.
You should find out.

03:30.781 --> 03:32.614
He's not my type.

03:32.616 --> 03:34.483
Girl, I'm starting to believe
you don't have a type.

03:36.120 --> 03:38.053
- Lady, need a ride?
- No, thanks.

03:38.055 --> 03:40.589
Sorry about my son, his wife's
still breaking him in.

03:42.425 --> 03:43.992
Hey, the other boy,
he's a sweetheart.

03:43.994 --> 03:45.595
All right.

05:02.170 --> 05:04.670
Thank you for sharing, Ann.

05:04.672 --> 05:07.072
So, listen, guys,
why don't we try an exercise?

05:07.074 --> 05:10.009
OK, relax. It's not a test.

05:10.011 --> 05:12.678
Here you go.

05:12.680 --> 05:14.580
Now, make a list, all right?

05:14.582 --> 05:16.615
Make a list of all the things
that you wanna do.

05:16.617 --> 05:18.750
All right, let your
imaginations run wild.

05:18.752 --> 05:20.085
If you want to scale Everest,
then go ahead

05:20.087 --> 05:20.818
and write that down.

05:20.820 --> 05:22.687
What if I want
to rob a bank?

05:22.689 --> 05:25.958
I can't say
that I approve,

05:25.960 --> 05:29.194
but go ahead and write it down.
I know a good lawyer.

05:29.196 --> 05:32.096
Feel free to inspire
each other, OK?

05:32.098 --> 05:34.034
Use each other for support.

05:58.724 --> 06:00.524
Nice of you
to join us, Skye.

06:00.526 --> 06:03.227
Well, you know me, Dan.
I'll be late for my own funeral.

06:03.229 --> 06:05.129
Yeah, well, you're more
than welcome to stay

06:05.131 --> 06:07.064
but any repeat of
last week's behavior,

06:07.066 --> 06:08.834
I'm gonna have to
ask you to leave.

06:09.768 --> 06:10.968
I'll be good as gold.

06:10.970 --> 06:12.604
All right.

06:17.277 --> 06:19.178
You're new.

06:22.081 --> 06:23.115
I'm Skye.

06:24.083 --> 06:25.682
Calvin.

06:25.684 --> 06:27.584
So, what are you
doing here, Calvin?

06:27.586 --> 06:31.087
Some terrible exercise about
climbing mountains and shit?

06:31.089 --> 06:33.290
Yeah, actually.

06:33.292 --> 06:34.892
Want to copy mine?

06:36.761 --> 06:40.065
I'm a little promiscuous when
it comes to support groups.

06:43.668 --> 06:44.667
What's with you?

06:44.669 --> 06:48.637
Sorry, your... face.
I...

06:48.639 --> 06:51.274
That was a wink, dummy.

06:51.276 --> 06:53.641
Playtime's over,
get back to work.

06:59.017 --> 07:00.850
What now?

07:00.852 --> 07:02.251
I don't know what to write.

07:02.253 --> 07:04.053
Write anything.
No one cares.

07:04.055 --> 07:06.988
You're dying, remember?

07:06.990 --> 07:08.857
Just don't write something
cliche, like

07:08.859 --> 07:09.991
"swimming with dolphins".

07:09.993 --> 07:11.260
And don't write
"Disneyland".

07:11.262 --> 07:12.927
I've been
to Disneyland, it's shit.

07:12.929 --> 07:14.596
Plus, there's, like,
1,000 dying kids there,

07:14.598 --> 07:16.365
so no one treats you
special or anything.

07:16.367 --> 07:19.036
Not even Mickey Mouse, that's,
like, passe to him, you know?

07:20.837 --> 07:22.904
You got a girlfriend?

07:22.906 --> 07:23.972
- Hm?
- Boyfriend?

07:23.974 --> 07:25.707
No.

07:25.709 --> 07:28.076
But there's someone
you like, hm?

07:28.078 --> 07:31.145
Maybe you think about them

07:31.147 --> 07:34.382
- when you're...
- Jesus!

07:34.384 --> 07:37.152
- Well?
- Can you leave me alone, please?

07:37.154 --> 07:39.923
- Just tell me her name, dummy.
- Don't call me that.

07:42.858 --> 07:44.258
I'm sorry.

07:44.260 --> 07:47.728
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to hurt your feelings.

07:47.730 --> 07:51.031
I just get so angry sometimes,
you know, I lash out.

07:51.033 --> 07:54.336
It's so unfair, I should have
my whole life ahead of me.

07:57.239 --> 08:00.076
I'm screwing with you.
Give me that.

08:05.847 --> 08:07.215
That'll do for starters.

08:12.321 --> 08:15.655
- Great job today, guys.
- See you, Calvin.

08:15.657 --> 08:18.326
- Thank you, Dan.
- Thanks again.

08:19.294 --> 08:20.927
Great job.

08:20.929 --> 08:23.996
- Hey, Dad. How'd it go?
- Well, still got cancer.

08:23.998 --> 08:26.699
Yeah, I'm aware.
It's a support group.

08:26.701 --> 08:28.235
I know, it's not voodoo.

08:28.237 --> 08:30.336
Oh, come on.

08:30.338 --> 08:31.803
You're killing me!

08:31.805 --> 08:34.407
Hey, Calvin.
Help a girl out?

08:34.409 --> 08:35.875
I'm gonna be late for work.

08:35.876 --> 08:37.743
Oh, come on, it will
just take a second.

08:37.745 --> 08:40.648
Just, you know,
push it or something.

08:45.953 --> 08:47.286
Not like that.

08:47.288 --> 08:49.324
Come on, put some hurt on it!

08:53.228 --> 08:56.096
- Ow!
- Yay! Go, Calvin!

08:58.365 --> 08:59.633
Want one?

09:01.702 --> 09:02.669
Sucks, huh?

09:03.303 --> 09:05.137
The big "C".

09:05.139 --> 09:07.740
They've run out of stages
for me now, what about you?

09:08.741 --> 09:10.410
I gotta go.

09:12.845 --> 09:14.946
Hey.

09:14.948 --> 09:17.351
Hey, you dropped this.

09:36.836 --> 09:37.902
I thought I felt something.

09:54.953 --> 09:57.086
There's nothing wrong
with you, Calvin.

09:57.088 --> 09:59.523
I just don't know how
many more ways to say it.

09:59.525 --> 10:01.525
Well, what about my symptoms?

10:01.527 --> 10:04.127
You say that you experience
pain, discomfort,

10:04.129 --> 10:04.994
and I believe you,

10:04.996 --> 10:07.197
but that's not
indicative of cancer.

10:07.199 --> 10:09.098
OK, and what about my mole?

10:09.100 --> 10:11.134
It's the same size
that it was last week.

10:11.136 --> 10:14.103
Then maybe we should do
more tests, just to be sure.

10:14.105 --> 10:15.805
There aren't any more tests.

10:15.807 --> 10:18.240
Your health issues
aren't physical.

10:18.242 --> 10:20.876
I thought sending you
to that support group

10:20.878 --> 10:24.012
would give you
a bit of perspective.

10:24.014 --> 10:25.781
I'm not making this up.

10:25.783 --> 10:27.217
All right?

10:27.219 --> 10:29.786
- Calvin...
- I'm not a hypochondriac.

10:30.988 --> 10:32.821
Your symptoms journal?

11:36.552 --> 11:39.587
- Hey.
- Oh.

11:39.589 --> 11:43.492
That was you, right?
With your dad and your brother?

11:44.126 --> 11:45.027
Mm-hm.

11:46.028 --> 11:47.861
Sorry about that.

11:47.863 --> 11:50.163
I know all about it.

11:50.165 --> 11:52.999
I have four... brothers.

11:53.001 --> 11:55.468
- Back in Ohio.
- Cool.

11:55.470 --> 11:58.340
You've obviously
never been to Ohio.

11:59.508 --> 12:01.341
I don't travel much.

12:01.343 --> 12:02.875
You work at an airport.

12:02.877 --> 12:06.412
- I've never flown.
- What? Really?

12:06.414 --> 12:10.516
I...
How is that even possible?

12:10.518 --> 12:13.520
You, my friend, are a disgrace
to the aviation industry.

12:16.391 --> 12:19.258
So, what do you
write in there?

12:19.260 --> 12:22.227
Oh, um, stuff, you know.

12:22.229 --> 12:24.165
Sounds like a bestseller.

12:26.233 --> 12:29.101
<i>Calvin Lewis
to the information desk.</i>

12:29.103 --> 12:31.002
<i>Calvin Lewis to
the information desk.</i>

12:31.004 --> 12:34.305
- That's me.
- Guess you should go then.

12:34.307 --> 12:35.975
I'm Izzy.

12:37.911 --> 12:40.013
- Um...
- Um...

12:41.947 --> 12:43.183
OK.

12:43.683 --> 12:44.850
See ya.

12:58.097 --> 13:00.933
Hi, I'm Calvin Lewis.

13:04.971 --> 13:07.304
- Hi, Calvin!
- Hi.

13:07.306 --> 13:09.373
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

13:09.375 --> 13:10.675
Oh, you dropped this
at the meeting.

13:10.677 --> 13:12.443
Oh, you have another one.

13:12.445 --> 13:13.644
Do you not have,
like, school?

13:13.646 --> 13:15.078
Is this your ride?

13:15.080 --> 13:16.414
- Wow.
- Yes.

13:16.416 --> 13:18.281
- Can I take it for a spin?
- No.

13:18.283 --> 13:19.249
- Please?
- No.

13:19.251 --> 13:20.550
But I'm dying.

13:20.552 --> 13:23.620
OK, it's not insured
for civilians, so...

13:23.622 --> 13:26.156
Civilians? Oh, come on,
I'm not gonna sue.

13:26.158 --> 13:27.991
- Cross my heart and hope to...
- Skye.

13:27.993 --> 13:29.959
So, are you one of these guys

13:29.961 --> 13:33.229
that's always going on strike
and breaking people's stuff?

13:33.231 --> 13:34.598
No.

13:34.600 --> 13:37.534
Have you ever gone through
someone's luggage?

13:37.536 --> 13:39.336
What's the weirdest thing
you've ever found?

13:39.338 --> 13:41.470
I bet you've found some
filthy things, haven't you?

13:41.472 --> 13:43.439
Go on, you can tell me, I'm
really good at keeping secrets.

13:43.441 --> 13:47.042
- I'm about to go on shift, so...
- Oh, amazing, I will come with.

13:47.044 --> 13:48.980
What?
No, I'm...

13:49.981 --> 13:51.382
Is that a goldfish?

13:52.250 --> 13:54.149
Yeah, he's for you.

13:54.151 --> 13:55.551
This is Boris.

13:55.553 --> 13:57.286
But you can call him
whatever you want

13:57.288 --> 13:59.255
because, you know, the whole
three second memory thing.

13:59.257 --> 14:01.125
Oh, my God.
Um...

14:01.993 --> 14:04.660
Why are you here?

14:04.662 --> 14:08.396
You are just as bad as Boris.
I'm here to return your ID.

14:08.398 --> 14:10.098
OK.
Thank you.

14:10.100 --> 14:13.704
Um... now,
could you please go?

14:15.005 --> 14:16.641
I mean, I could.

14:19.042 --> 14:20.575
Look, I'm sorry
to be blunt, OK?

14:20.577 --> 14:22.577
It's just the way I am.

14:22.579 --> 14:24.112
But if you're gonna beat
this thing, you're gonna

14:24.114 --> 14:25.480
have to grow a pair.

14:25.482 --> 14:27.315
You don't have cancer of
the balls, do you? Because that

14:27.317 --> 14:28.383
would make me kind of a dick.

14:28.385 --> 14:30.250
- No, I do not have...
- Oh, thank God.

14:30.252 --> 14:33.488
OK, so we start tomorrow.

14:33.490 --> 14:36.090
- Start what?
- My to-die list.

14:36.092 --> 14:38.593
It's like a bucket list
but not as lame.

14:38.595 --> 14:40.628
Don't worry, I'm not gonna
drag you to Amsterdam.

14:40.630 --> 14:43.698
- I've got work tomorrow, so...
- Play the cancer card.

14:43.700 --> 14:44.967
Cancer card?

14:46.068 --> 14:47.136
I have cancer.

14:49.706 --> 14:51.573
Sometimes they give you money.

14:51.575 --> 14:53.172
- So what do you say?
- Um...

14:53.174 --> 14:55.977
Are you down or are you down?
Mm! Let's do this.

14:56.412 --> 14:58.712
Um...

14:58.714 --> 15:00.781
I'll meet you
at the fountain at four.

15:00.783 --> 15:03.319
Take good care of Boris!

15:05.621 --> 15:08.321
So, Lucy, seriously,
what do you think?

15:08.323 --> 15:10.491
On time, week early, week late?

15:10.493 --> 15:13.227
No, no, no, no, just pick a day.
Pick a day.

15:13.229 --> 15:16.763
- Wait, what are you guys doing?
- It's a gentleman's bet.

15:16.765 --> 15:18.564
Just trying to get a gauge.

15:18.566 --> 15:22.068
OK. The baby's gonna come
when it's gonna come, Bob.

15:22.070 --> 15:25.572
OK, well, just so you know,
these Lewis boys all came late.

15:25.574 --> 15:27.041
Isn't that right, Ellen?

15:32.112 --> 15:35.583
So, you gonna head back
to college next year?

15:36.584 --> 15:37.717
I don't know.

15:37.719 --> 15:39.619
Haven't really thought about it.

15:39.621 --> 15:42.220
Figured after six months at the
airport, you'd be running back.

15:42.222 --> 15:45.290
You know, I don't mind
working there.

15:45.292 --> 15:47.460
Twelve hour shifts,
back-breaking labor?

15:47.462 --> 15:48.494
Yeah, what's not to like?

15:48.496 --> 15:50.128
All right, take it easy.

15:50.130 --> 15:52.598
How's that
working out for ya?

15:52.600 --> 15:54.332
You can stay here
as long as you like.

15:54.334 --> 15:56.735
- His tests came back clean.
- Leave him alone.

15:56.737 --> 15:59.571
No, no, no, you just spent money
that you don't have,

15:59.573 --> 16:02.140
testing for something
that he never had.

16:02.142 --> 16:04.044
Thanks for dinner.

16:16.690 --> 16:20.558
Ashley, please tell me
Will is coming to your party.

16:20.560 --> 16:21.795
Did someone say "party"?

16:22.763 --> 16:24.196
Skye.

16:25.766 --> 16:28.533
You look like you seen a ghost.

16:28.535 --> 16:30.734
Just haven't seen
you around lately.

16:30.736 --> 16:32.770
Been busy.

16:32.772 --> 16:35.639
Who knew dying could be
so time-consuming?

16:35.641 --> 16:38.411
So... we've gotta go.

16:39.378 --> 16:41.144
You coming, Ashley?

16:41.146 --> 16:42.546
I'll catch up
with you guys.

16:42.548 --> 16:45.418
OK. See you, Skye.

16:48.921 --> 16:51.424
So, I'm having a party
this weekend.

16:51.924 --> 16:53.189
Cool.

16:53.191 --> 16:54.691
You should come.

16:54.693 --> 16:56.827
If I have the time, sure.

16:56.829 --> 16:58.630
Cool.

17:00.866 --> 17:03.502
I should catch up with them.

17:04.269 --> 17:05.502
- Right.
- Bye.

17:12.711 --> 17:14.746
I thought we were
meeting by the fountain.

17:15.512 --> 17:16.714
You came.

17:17.816 --> 17:19.682
- You OK?
- I have cancer.

17:19.684 --> 17:22.184
Right... about that...

17:22.185 --> 17:25.355
- Less talk, more shopping.
- OK.

17:25.357 --> 17:26.955
You know, it's kinda
creepy that you're hanging out

17:26.958 --> 17:29.593
outside the ladies'
changing room.

17:32.296 --> 17:33.364
I'm fine.

17:36.835 --> 17:38.901
So, how long you
been in the States?

17:38.903 --> 17:41.672
Dad moved us here
when I was ten.

17:43.474 --> 17:44.573
You at Kingston High?

17:44.575 --> 17:46.508
East Kingston.

17:46.510 --> 17:48.543
Go Bluebirds, whoo.

17:48.545 --> 17:50.746
Skye, you know,

17:50.748 --> 17:53.447
- something I should tell you...
- Let's go.

17:53.449 --> 17:56.217
The kind of support group thing
we were at?

17:56.219 --> 17:59.621
- Can you run in those shoes?
- I don't... What?

17:59.623 --> 18:01.556
Never mind.
Hold this.

18:01.558 --> 18:04.426
What's in it?
Skye.

18:04.428 --> 18:05.926
Run!

18:05.928 --> 18:07.263
Run?

18:07.964 --> 18:08.898
Oh.

18:14.537 --> 18:15.904
Wow.

18:15.906 --> 18:19.540
Doesn't even match.

18:19.542 --> 18:22.877
That is some stone cold
pervert 101 shit right there.

18:22.879 --> 18:26.781
Wait a minute.
I knew I recognized you,

18:26.783 --> 18:28.649
I never forget a face.

18:28.651 --> 18:30.985
This guy goes to my old man's
cancer support group.

18:30.987 --> 18:32.019
No shit.

18:32.021 --> 18:35.488
Oh, new meds, right?

18:35.490 --> 18:37.323
When my old man's
medications change,

18:37.325 --> 18:38.859
he goes batshit crazy too.

18:38.861 --> 18:40.394
Come on, you
should have said something.

18:40.396 --> 18:42.328
All right, get up,
boy, you're OK.

18:42.330 --> 18:43.997
All right, not your fault.

18:43.999 --> 18:47.536
Not your fault.
OK, case closed.

18:48.870 --> 18:50.370
Hey.

18:50.372 --> 18:53.709
You fight this shit,
you hear me?

18:59.548 --> 19:01.347
Yeah!

19:01.349 --> 19:03.717
That was so balls-out amazing!

19:03.719 --> 19:05.784
- You get off me!
- They full on tasered you!

19:05.786 --> 19:07.553
I can't believe that
wasn't on my list!

19:07.555 --> 19:08.387
You set me up!

19:08.389 --> 19:09.421
I told you to run.

19:09.423 --> 19:10.489
I could have been arrested!

19:10.491 --> 19:12.458
And I could have lived to 102.

19:12.460 --> 19:14.961
You stole some shit,
you got away with it.

19:14.963 --> 19:16.495
Just enjoy the moment.

19:16.497 --> 19:18.530
OK, so you got tasered.

19:18.532 --> 19:21.934
And pissed yourself? Eww.

19:21.936 --> 19:23.969
But you did something
you've never done before.

19:23.971 --> 19:25.904
Doesn't that feel good?

19:25.906 --> 19:27.608
Admit it, it's a rush.

19:28.576 --> 19:29.910
Give me your hand.

19:31.377 --> 19:32.410
Feel that?

19:32.412 --> 19:34.445
Do you feel that?

19:34.447 --> 19:36.615
- Yes.
- What does that mean?

19:36.617 --> 19:37.816
It means I'm alive.

19:37.818 --> 19:40.686
No, Calvin, it means
you're a pussy.

19:40.688 --> 19:42.653
How do you expect
to beat a lie detector test

19:42.655 --> 19:44.055
if you can't regulate
your heartbeat?

19:44.057 --> 19:46.457
Why would I need
to beat a lie detector?

19:46.459 --> 19:49.427
Because it's on the list, dummy.

19:49.429 --> 19:51.697
I give up.

19:51.699 --> 19:54.532
I used to think you were cool,
Calvin, but you're not.

19:54.534 --> 19:55.967
Don't ever call me again.

19:55.969 --> 19:58.102
I don't even have your number.

19:58.104 --> 20:00.938
Come on, come on, come on, come
on, come on, come on, come on.

20:00.940 --> 20:01.508
Skye, wait!

20:04.010 --> 20:06.345
What else is on your list?

22:04.060 --> 22:05.158
So did you ask
what's-her-name out

22:05.160 --> 22:05.895
on a date yet?

22:06.128 --> 22:07.593
No.

22:07.595 --> 22:09.162
Does what's-her-name
have a name?

22:09.164 --> 22:10.797
Izzy.

22:10.799 --> 22:13.567
Izzy, Izzy, Izzy,
Calvin's getting busy.

22:13.569 --> 22:15.035
Is she here,
can I meet her?

22:15.037 --> 22:16.570
No.

22:16.572 --> 22:17.970
Skye, I need to
tell you something.

22:17.972 --> 22:19.572
You're a virgin, I know.

22:19.574 --> 22:20.941
I'm not a virgin.

22:20.943 --> 22:22.708
- Really?
- Why?

22:22.710 --> 22:25.145
I... I'm just surprised.
You kinda have that aura.

22:25.147 --> 22:27.080
Now can you be serious
about something?

22:27.082 --> 22:29.515
I can be serious
about finding Izzy.

22:29.517 --> 22:30.919
Get off the road!

22:32.987 --> 22:34.887
Girl, you didn't even
take any selfies.

22:34.889 --> 22:35.988
And where are the hot boys?

22:35.990 --> 22:40.027
Unlike you, I actually care
what's on the inside.

22:40.029 --> 22:41.994
Wow.

22:41.996 --> 22:45.197
Do you think
she's too cool for me?

22:45.199 --> 22:47.033
She's too everything for you.

22:47.035 --> 22:48.901
Hi.

22:48.903 --> 22:50.836
Ooh! Now's your chance!

22:50.838 --> 22:52.640
Drive up there
and whisk her away.

22:53.874 --> 22:55.540
Do I have to do everything?

22:55.542 --> 22:57.078
No, Skye.

23:35.581 --> 23:37.881
I don't know if I should
give this to you.

23:37.883 --> 23:39.583
She's so out of your league.

23:39.585 --> 23:42.786
Fine. I can just ask her out
whenever I want,

23:42.788 --> 23:44.056
I see her all the time.

23:45.257 --> 23:46.993
What if she says no?

23:52.998 --> 23:55.099
When you call her,
ask her what she's wearing.

23:55.101 --> 23:56.835
Girls like that.

23:59.338 --> 24:00.871
<i>Hey... Hey, Izzy.</i>

24:00.873 --> 24:02.272
<i>It's Calvin.</i>

24:02.274 --> 24:04.274
Hey. Hey, Izzy.

24:04.276 --> 24:07.610
Hey, Izzy, what are you wearing?

24:07.612 --> 24:11.080
Hello, Izzy.
Creepy.

24:11.082 --> 24:14.851
I'm Calvin.
Sup, Izzy? It's Cal.

24:14.853 --> 24:16.818
It's Cal.

24:16.820 --> 24:18.888
What's up, Iz?
It's Calvin.

24:20.825 --> 24:23.159
- Hey, Izzy. It's Cal...
- <i>Hello.</i>

24:23.161 --> 24:25.061
<i>Thank you for calling
Albany Flight School.</i>

24:25.063 --> 24:27.030
<i>For information on becoming
a flight attendant,</i>

24:27.032 --> 24:30.266
<i>please leave your name,
number and a detailed message.</i>

24:30.268 --> 24:32.903
<i>Thank you and have a nice day.</i>

24:36.941 --> 24:38.742
Whoo!

24:39.277 --> 24:40.245
Sorry, I'm...

24:42.046 --> 24:43.981
I'm Calvin, Skye's friend.

24:50.954 --> 24:53.188
Why was he dressed as a ghost?

24:53.190 --> 24:56.793
- What are we doing?
- Oh, my God.

24:59.763 --> 25:00.962
You look grown up.

25:00.964 --> 25:03.867
- Thanks.
- Skye, who's Calvin?

25:05.134 --> 25:07.935
Calvin's here.
Why didn't you say?

25:07.937 --> 25:09.670
Wait, why do you look grown-up?

25:09.672 --> 25:12.640
Ashley's having a party,
old friends are gonna be there.

25:12.642 --> 25:14.910
Um, but so are parents,
so, you know, lame.

25:14.912 --> 25:16.877
You're going to a party.

25:16.879 --> 25:17.945
Yeah, Calvin's bringing me.

25:17.947 --> 25:19.146
And who's Calvin?

25:19.148 --> 25:20.714
Don't worry, we won't be late.

25:20.716 --> 25:24.218
Skye. Your mum
asked you a question.

25:24.220 --> 25:25.820
- Who's Calvin?
- Who's Calvin?

25:25.822 --> 25:28.192
From my support group.

25:37.666 --> 25:40.267
I can't believe
this wasn't on my list.

25:40.269 --> 25:41.935
Did you steal it?

25:41.937 --> 25:44.005
Let's just say
I know a guy.

25:46.041 --> 25:48.309
What?
I know people.

25:48.311 --> 25:51.345
And, hey, I thought you said
this was a costume party.

25:51.347 --> 25:53.880
Oh, it is. I just,
I didn't think my parents

25:53.882 --> 25:55.048
would approve of mine.

25:55.050 --> 25:59.052
- Should I be worried?
- When are you not?

25:59.054 --> 26:01.221
Watch it, you're swerving
all over the place.

26:01.223 --> 26:03.357
OK, I'm not swerving.

26:03.359 --> 26:05.358
This is swerving.

26:10.966 --> 26:13.833
Oh, no.
No, no, no.

26:13.835 --> 26:15.435
Ruh-ro, maybe not the best time

26:15.437 --> 26:17.336
to come out of your shell,
Calvin.

26:17.338 --> 26:19.404
Think we can outrun them?

26:19.406 --> 26:22.676
Stop, just stop, just stop.

26:24.346 --> 26:27.180
- License and registration, sir?
- Yeah.

26:27.182 --> 26:29.982
It's you.

26:29.984 --> 26:32.951
Man, this is a nice rig.
What is this, custom?

26:32.953 --> 26:37.189
Jesus H. Christ, it is you.
How you been, man?

26:37.191 --> 26:39.492
- Are you still fighting back?
- Mm-hm.

26:39.494 --> 26:44.496
Hang on, you were
at the support group too.

26:44.498 --> 26:46.431
No, for real?

26:46.433 --> 26:48.102
Straight up and down.

26:49.769 --> 26:51.904
No, I'm good,
I'm good, I'm gonna...

26:51.906 --> 26:54.138
- Um... Whoa!
- Fuck cancer!

26:54.140 --> 26:56.474
I'm gonna walk this off,
you guys have a good night.

26:56.476 --> 27:00.445
All right. Hey, bro,
you need anything,

27:00.447 --> 27:04.917
anything, you give your boy
a holler, all right?

27:06.952 --> 27:09.287
We confiscated some
high-grade icky,

27:09.289 --> 27:11.255
would you like some, sweetie?

27:11.257 --> 27:13.124
You know, he's...
We're driving.

27:13.126 --> 27:14.058
No. I'm driving.

27:14.060 --> 27:17.996
Oh, right. Sorry.
I'm here for you, bro.

27:19.131 --> 27:20.899
Just a call away.

27:22.801 --> 27:27.405
Holy shit, Calvin, you've
got the cops on speed dial.

27:27.407 --> 27:28.837
So, I called Izzy.

27:28.839 --> 27:30.273
Oh, yeah?
How did that go?

27:30.275 --> 27:33.378
Look alive!

27:36.448 --> 27:38.982
Skye, you said people
were getting dressed up.

27:38.984 --> 27:42.885
Oh, dear Calvin,
always with the negativity.

27:42.887 --> 27:44.487
Come on.

27:44.489 --> 27:47.324
Skye, hold up.

27:47.326 --> 27:50.794
What up, bitches?
Death's in the house!

27:50.796 --> 27:52.364
Skye, hey.

27:53.331 --> 27:54.897
How'd you know it was me?

27:54.899 --> 27:57.166
So are you
drinking tonight?

27:57.168 --> 28:00.305
Or are you all, like,
super medicated and shit?

28:04.375 --> 28:05.309
Yeah, I'm drinking.

28:09.447 --> 28:12.316
Yeah! Chug, chug, chug!

28:29.833 --> 28:31.366
<i>♪ Every time
You leave you got me ♪</i>

28:31.368 --> 28:32.668
<i>♪ Feeling like a fiend</i>

28:32.670 --> 28:35.003

28:35.005 --> 28:37.872
<i>♪ Need to feel the buzz

28:37.874 --> 28:40.375
<i>♪ I gotta get away

28:50.954 --> 28:52.888
This song, come on!

30:08.962 --> 30:10.464
<i>I'm fine.</i>

30:12.099 --> 30:17.000
Oh, my God. I so thought
you didn't want to talk to me.

30:17.002 --> 30:20.505
No, I thought that
you were avoiding me.

30:20.507 --> 30:22.607
No.

30:22.609 --> 30:26.277
- I missed you so much.
- I missed you, too.

30:26.279 --> 30:29.213
Oh, oh!

30:29.215 --> 30:31.982
- Oh, man down.
- Are you OK?

30:31.984 --> 30:34.017
I'm-I'm fine.

30:34.019 --> 30:36.086
I think I need off my feet
for a second.

30:36.088 --> 30:37.157
OK, yeah.

30:53.406 --> 30:55.272
Skye, Skye, we gotta go.

30:55.274 --> 30:57.174
Oh, but I'm having so much fun.

30:57.176 --> 30:58.742
- Please, please.
- Boop.

30:58.744 --> 31:00.980
Come on. Skye.

31:07.653 --> 31:09.287
Skye.

31:22.100 --> 31:24.467
Skye, get in the car.

31:24.469 --> 31:26.068
Stranger danger!

31:26.070 --> 31:28.604
- Stranger danger!
- Can you keep your voice down?

31:28.606 --> 31:29.973
Stranger danger.

31:30.608 --> 31:32.375
Skye.

31:32.377 --> 31:34.446
Ashley knows how much
I like him.

31:35.246 --> 31:36.581
Skye, please.

31:37.682 --> 31:39.615
Your parents are gonna kill me.

31:39.617 --> 31:42.384
I don't feel so good.

31:42.386 --> 31:45.086
Are you...? No, don't, don't!

31:53.697 --> 31:58.066
- Hey, Bob.
- Hi, girl. How you feeling?

31:58.068 --> 31:59.403
You wanna hop up front?

32:00.170 --> 32:01.371
I'm good.

32:21.557 --> 32:23.758
Hey, Calvin.

32:23.760 --> 32:27.429
- Skye.
- Back from the dead.

32:27.431 --> 32:29.797
- Are you OK?
- No thanks to you.

32:29.799 --> 32:32.131
"Come to the party", you said.
"It'll be fun."

32:32.133 --> 32:35.304
- No, you invited me.
- Tomato, tomahto.

32:38.741 --> 32:40.741
Are your parents mad at me?

32:40.743 --> 32:43.276
You left me on the porch
and ran away.

32:43.278 --> 32:45.111
You completely
bailed on me, man.

32:45.113 --> 32:47.581
Well, you shouldn't have
put me in that position, Skye.

32:47.583 --> 32:49.817
Do you know how worried I was?

32:49.819 --> 32:52.252
No, Calvin, I must
have missed your calls.

32:52.254 --> 32:53.419
Is this a game to you?

32:53.421 --> 32:55.221
I'm dying.

32:55.223 --> 32:56.489
You can't keep
pulling that on me.

32:56.491 --> 32:59.592
No, Calvin, I mean I'm dying.

32:59.594 --> 33:02.161
What am I supposed to do,
curl up in a ball and cry?

33:02.163 --> 33:04.831
I've done that,
all right? I just...

33:04.833 --> 33:07.634
I wanted to have some fun.
I'm sorry I ruined your life.

33:07.636 --> 33:10.403
I mean, you were doing great
before I came along.

33:10.405 --> 33:13.139
Hey, guys.

33:13.141 --> 33:16.174
- Izzy.
- Hey, girlfriend.

33:16.176 --> 33:18.745
- What's up?
- Did you call that number?

33:18.747 --> 33:20.579
They're sending out
the information.

33:20.581 --> 33:23.382
I think you'll be a great
flight attendant someday.

33:23.384 --> 33:25.718
Maybe you can even get
your brother to fly with you.

33:25.720 --> 33:27.754
- Brother?
- That's the dream.

33:27.756 --> 33:29.888
- Join us, sit down.
- Skye.

33:29.890 --> 33:32.157
I really should get going.

33:32.159 --> 33:33.792
Boyfriend waiting for you?

33:33.794 --> 33:38.196
No, no, no boyfriend.

33:39.199 --> 33:42.768
Well, what are you waiting for?
Pull up a pew.

33:42.770 --> 33:45.804
OK.
Just for a second maybe.

33:45.806 --> 33:49.775
Have you tried these muffins?
They are to die for.

33:49.777 --> 33:52.743
- Um... OK.
- So, Izzy.

33:52.745 --> 33:55.179
I've got this dilemma.

33:55.181 --> 33:58.416
There's, like, this boy
that I really like

33:58.418 --> 34:01.218
and I want to go on a date
with him, like, so bad,

34:01.220 --> 34:04.355
but our parents are being all
psychotically parental about it.

34:04.357 --> 34:06.490
Anyway, long story short,

34:06.492 --> 34:08.626
I can't go without a chaperone.

34:08.628 --> 34:13.831
So I came here to beg my big
brother to help his sister out.

34:13.833 --> 34:16.734
Calvin here thinks
it's way too late

34:16.735 --> 34:19.804
to ask someone and...
Oh, my God.

34:19.806 --> 34:22.773
- You guys should go together.
- Skye.

34:22.775 --> 34:24.274
Not like a "date" date,
that would be weird,

34:24.275 --> 34:25.108
you guys just met,

34:25.110 --> 34:26.377
but, FYI, if you wanted to,
like,

34:26.379 --> 34:27.777
you could totally
pull that off.

34:28.880 --> 34:30.580
Just go, you know,
as colleagues.

34:30.581 --> 34:33.683
We're not exactly "colleagues".

34:33.685 --> 34:35.385
Aren't we all colleagues,
though?

34:35.387 --> 34:37.387
You know, like when you
really think about it?

34:37.389 --> 34:39.523
Huh.

34:39.525 --> 34:40.759
Hm?

34:42.226 --> 34:43.760
- Please? Please?
- Well...

34:43.762 --> 34:45.929
Please, please, please,
please, please, please?

34:45.931 --> 34:47.864
Oh, I would love to help,

34:47.866 --> 34:50.766
but I've had a crazy week
and I just...

34:50.768 --> 34:52.871
What did I say?

34:55.572 --> 34:56.940
There's no way
she could have known.

34:56.942 --> 34:58.610
Known what?

35:00.479 --> 35:01.780
You tell her.

35:03.214 --> 35:04.649
Tell me what?

35:07.251 --> 35:08.853
I have cancer.

35:11.222 --> 35:14.390
It's a rare strand,
I don't have much time left.

35:14.392 --> 35:17.392
I don't know what to say.

35:17.394 --> 35:19.162
You don't
have to say anything.

35:19.964 --> 35:21.432
Just come to the movies with us.

35:27.805 --> 35:29.506
What just happened?

35:31.942 --> 35:35.611
You look
nice out of uniform.

35:35.613 --> 35:37.513
I don't look nice in uniform?

35:37.515 --> 35:39.682
Well, no.
I mean, I didn't, I...

35:46.423 --> 35:48.790
Maybe you should
try Skye again.

35:48.792 --> 35:51.860
She does stuff like this
all the time.

35:51.862 --> 35:54.196
Like pretend
she's your sister?

35:55.665 --> 35:57.297
Yeah.

35:57.299 --> 35:59.332
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

35:59.334 --> 36:00.870
I'm sure she's fine.

36:02.472 --> 36:04.738
But she really
is sick, right?

36:04.740 --> 36:08.544
Yeah, um, we met at some
cancer support group.

36:10.479 --> 36:11.611
Oh, my God.

36:11.613 --> 36:14.448
- I had no idea.
- No, I...

36:14.450 --> 36:16.950
Yo, yo, yo, make some room
for your girl Skye.

36:16.952 --> 36:18.919
What up, peeps? Miss me?

36:18.921 --> 36:22.389
- Jig is up, Skye.
- Bollocks.

36:22.391 --> 36:25.227
- You're late.
- Shh, it's starting.

36:34.737 --> 36:36.069
A little thank you
would be nice.

36:36.071 --> 36:38.538
What, for ruining
my chances with Izzy?

36:38.540 --> 36:40.973
Oh, come on, I set you guys up.
I'm like a postmodern Cupid.

36:40.975 --> 36:42.508
She thinks I have cancer!

36:42.510 --> 36:44.944
- So?
- Well, Skye, I don't.

36:44.946 --> 36:46.046
I know.

36:46.048 --> 36:47.747
What?

36:47.749 --> 36:49.548
I overheard you
talking with Dan.

36:49.550 --> 36:51.317
And you didn't say anything?

36:51.319 --> 36:52.885
You're the one pretending
to have cancer.

36:52.887 --> 36:55.588
- Oh, no, no, I never said...
- Anything?

36:55.590 --> 36:58.057
- I tried to tell you.
- Right.

36:58.059 --> 37:01.462
Congrats, it must be real nice
having a clean bill of health.

37:03.464 --> 37:04.929
Where are you going?

37:04.931 --> 37:07.432
- Home.
- No.

37:07.434 --> 37:09.902
No, Skye, you're the one
who came to me.

37:09.904 --> 37:11.904
- My bad.
- No, I wanna know why.

37:11.906 --> 37:13.672
- Just leave me alone.
- Tell me why.

37:13.674 --> 37:16.007
Because it's on the list, OK?

37:16.009 --> 37:17.675
Where?

37:17.677 --> 37:19.978
What?

37:19.980 --> 37:21.446
"Punch someone
in the face"?

37:21.448 --> 37:23.748
No, help a sad case.

37:23.750 --> 37:27.052
Wow. Thanks.

37:27.054 --> 37:31.488
Before I got sick, I was just
waiting for my life to start.

37:31.490 --> 37:33.024
Turns out,
life doesn't work that way.

37:33.026 --> 37:35.359
I thought maybe I could
help you see that.

37:35.361 --> 37:36.928
I didn't ask
for your help.

37:36.930 --> 37:40.030
Friends don't wait
to be asked.

37:40.032 --> 37:42.466
You know,
I actually liked you.

37:42.468 --> 37:45.069
I mean, sure,
you're hung up and weird,

37:45.071 --> 37:47.972
and if I had a single other
friend in the entire world,

37:47.974 --> 37:50.909
I'd probably have
nothing to do with you.

37:50.911 --> 37:53.677
But as messed up as that is,
I liked you.

37:53.679 --> 37:55.748
I thought
you liked me too.

37:57.449 --> 37:59.983
Skye, I d... I do!

37:59.985 --> 38:02.989
- I want to be your friend.
- Why?

38:04.389 --> 38:06.589
Because...

38:06.591 --> 38:08.692
you terrify me

38:08.694 --> 38:12.029
and... you excite me

38:12.031 --> 38:14.066
and when you're not around...

38:15.100 --> 38:16.768
I miss you.

38:19.103 --> 38:20.703
You really miss me?

38:20.705 --> 38:23.341
Yes, I do.

38:26.644 --> 38:28.610
Like, how much?
Like, on a scale of one to 10?

38:28.612 --> 38:31.583
Oh, my God, Skye. Stop.

38:33.985 --> 38:35.753
You're not gonna try
and kiss me now, are you?

38:40.858 --> 38:43.427
Are you really gonna
punch someone in the face?

38:43.895 --> 38:45.129
Ooh!

38:49.601 --> 38:50.833
<i>Are you sure
we're allowed to be</i>

38:50.835 --> 38:51.701
<i>in here this late?</i>

38:51.703 --> 38:53.768
Before state,
coach gave us key cards

38:53.770 --> 38:56.638
so as we could train here
whenever we liked.

38:56.640 --> 38:59.977
You can change in...
there.

39:01.511 --> 39:02.879
It's fine,
don't worry about it.

39:02.881 --> 39:04.746
Then why
are we whispering?

39:04.748 --> 39:06.815
I don't make the rules.

39:06.817 --> 39:08.482
You make all the rules.

39:08.484 --> 39:09.953
I heard that.

39:59.201 --> 40:00.834
You jumped off of that?

40:00.836 --> 40:03.237
I didn't jump, Calvin.

40:03.239 --> 40:06.107
It's not called
"state jumping championship".

40:07.742 --> 40:09.611
Well, you go first.

40:11.046 --> 40:12.480
Wuss.

41:35.328 --> 41:38.963
Ooh! Wow!

41:38.965 --> 41:41.731
Oh, my God, that was amazing!

41:41.733 --> 41:43.969
How did you do that?

41:47.039 --> 41:48.071
Your turn.

41:48.073 --> 41:50.876
OK. OK.

41:53.145 --> 41:54.277
How did you do this?

41:54.279 --> 41:56.712
No, you're doing fine.
You're doing so good.

41:56.714 --> 41:57.914
Listen,
it's scary the first time.

41:57.916 --> 41:59.115
No.

41:59.117 --> 42:00.617
Oh, come on, it's just,
it's the little one,

42:00.619 --> 42:01.484
you'll be fine.

42:01.486 --> 42:03.819
- I'm just gonna...
- You can do this.

42:03.821 --> 42:06.288
OK, yeah, just stand, that's it.

42:06.290 --> 42:08.023
Just stand and
just look forwards.

42:08.025 --> 42:09.658
Look forwards, don't look down.

42:09.660 --> 42:12.295
Oh, my God, you're erect!

42:12.297 --> 42:14.197
Oh.

42:14.199 --> 42:16.165
What is this?

42:17.802 --> 42:19.968
- Where are you going?
- One second.

42:19.970 --> 42:21.670
No, no, Calvin.

42:21.672 --> 42:23.272
OK, we'll take
a different approach.

42:23.274 --> 42:27.975
Just look out,
chin up, run and jump.

42:27.977 --> 42:30.645
Yeah, just gonna run, jump.

42:30.647 --> 42:32.814
State jumping
championship, let's go!

42:32.816 --> 42:34.351
- Just jump. Yes!
- oh!

42:38.022 --> 42:39.056
Oh.

42:48.132 --> 42:50.665
You did it, you did it!

42:50.667 --> 42:52.033
Yeah, I did.

43:24.800 --> 43:26.766
I can't believe I dived.

43:26.768 --> 43:29.436
I dived. You fell.

43:29.438 --> 43:31.173
Right.

43:32.441 --> 43:34.174
Plus, you got to see me
in a bathing suit,

43:34.176 --> 43:36.376
so tonight's just one, big,
wet dream come true for you.

43:36.378 --> 43:38.180
Oh, my God.

43:41.849 --> 43:44.116
Hey, you should really
get this mole checked.

43:44.118 --> 43:46.355
Looks pretty serious.

43:48.157 --> 43:49.857
Screwing with you!

46:13.196 --> 46:14.131
Hey.

46:15.331 --> 46:16.297
Hi.

46:16.299 --> 46:18.000
- Hey.
- Hi.

46:19.969 --> 46:22.103
No Skye here today?

46:22.105 --> 46:25.042
No, she, uh,
has a doctor's appointment.

46:26.576 --> 46:29.076
I am so sorry about Saturday.

46:29.078 --> 46:31.045
I swear I didn't
put her up to it.

46:31.047 --> 46:33.615
I-I've had worse dates.

46:33.617 --> 46:36.551
This guy took me
to the movies once.

46:36.553 --> 46:38.653
Halfway through,
he goes to the bathroom

46:38.655 --> 46:40.354
and when he comes back,
he sits three rows

46:40.356 --> 46:41.288
in front of me

46:41.290 --> 46:44.458
and puts his arm around
some random girl.

46:44.460 --> 46:46.560
He thought she was you?

46:46.562 --> 46:48.996
I didn't stick around
to find out.

46:53.436 --> 46:54.836
You gotta go?

46:57.540 --> 46:59.175
I have some time.

47:01.377 --> 47:03.443
Izzy, these are incredible.

47:03.445 --> 47:05.345
You really like them?

47:05.347 --> 47:07.380
Are you kidding?

47:07.382 --> 47:09.382
They're amazing.

47:09.384 --> 47:11.417
Oh, my God.

47:11.419 --> 47:13.387
I'm gonna miss my flight.

47:13.389 --> 47:15.488
I can give you a ride,
if you want.

47:15.490 --> 47:17.158
- Really?
- Yeah, I got a tug.

47:36.611 --> 47:38.111
Uh-oh.

47:38.113 --> 47:40.280
Mom looks mad.

47:41.014 --> 47:42.583
OK, well...

47:43.650 --> 47:45.018
I'd better go.

47:46.320 --> 47:47.921
Um...

47:49.022 --> 47:50.656
Izzy, do you want to, like,

47:50.658 --> 47:54.526
do you want to hang out
sometime, just the two of us?

47:54.528 --> 47:56.330
Without Skye?

47:57.131 --> 47:58.997
I'd like that.

47:58.999 --> 48:02.403
Let's go! Girl, you better get
your scrawny ass on this plane.

48:06.740 --> 48:08.139
That's the guy you're dating?

48:08.141 --> 48:10.341
He's two years younger than me.

48:10.343 --> 48:13.311
All right, fine, three.
Look, I know it's weird,

48:13.313 --> 48:15.045
but there's something about him.

48:15.047 --> 48:17.114
Something... rich?

48:17.116 --> 48:18.449
He's sweet.

48:18.451 --> 48:21.152
- And he's thoughtful.
- Girl...

48:21.154 --> 48:23.022
Just make the announcement.

48:24.524 --> 48:26.159
Calvin...

48:27.359 --> 48:29.395
have you ever killed anyone?

48:32.230 --> 48:33.599
No.

48:38.471 --> 48:40.003
That's true.

48:40.005 --> 48:42.405
Skye, have you
ever killed anyone?

48:42.407 --> 48:44.142
Yes.

48:46.746 --> 48:48.378
That's a lie.

48:48.380 --> 48:51.114
This is harder than I thought.

48:51.116 --> 48:54.317
Calvin, is Skye
your best friend?

48:54.319 --> 48:56.154
No.

48:57.522 --> 48:59.456
- That is a lie.
- What?

48:59.458 --> 49:02.592
Well, am I your best friend?

49:02.594 --> 49:04.663
- No.
- Definitely a lie.

49:06.330 --> 49:09.097
Calvin, real life situation.

49:09.099 --> 49:11.200
Do you smell your own farts?

49:11.202 --> 49:14.137
No.

49:17.308 --> 49:19.410
It's inconclusive.

49:24.816 --> 49:29.453
Calvin Lewis, would you switch
places with me if you could?

49:33.591 --> 49:34.758
Yes.

50:35.617 --> 50:37.252
Hi, love.

50:40.822 --> 50:42.390
Hi.

50:43.625 --> 50:45.425
Dad in?

50:45.427 --> 50:48.463
No, should be back soon.

50:51.332 --> 50:53.465
Wanna watch a film tonight?

50:53.467 --> 50:55.301
Something funny.

50:55.303 --> 50:56.803
Yeah.

50:56.805 --> 50:58.537
That's a good idea.

50:58.539 --> 51:00.508
- Cup of tea?
- Yeah.

51:24.865 --> 51:27.498
You think we made
the right choice,

51:27.500 --> 51:29.769
not going back
to England?

51:31.871 --> 51:34.174
It's not what she wants.

51:35.275 --> 51:36.809
All her friends are here.

51:36.811 --> 51:39.242
Not like she sees them.

51:39.244 --> 51:42.447
Spends all her time with Calvin.

51:42.449 --> 51:44.851
Well, he...
he seems to be helping.

51:47.420 --> 51:48.653
Do you think we can trust him?

51:48.655 --> 51:51.188
It's not him
that I'm worried about.

51:53.692 --> 51:56.828
- All right, let's go.
- Skye, how was this on the list?

51:56.830 --> 51:58.896
It says it right here.

51:58.898 --> 52:01.599
"Get arrested with Calvin."

52:01.601 --> 52:02.834
You just added that in.

52:02.836 --> 52:04.868
My list, my rules.
Lock him up.

52:04.870 --> 52:08.807
Skye, this isn't funny.

52:11.945 --> 52:14.478
Yay, Calvin!

52:14.480 --> 52:16.747
You know how fast
you were walking?

52:16.749 --> 52:18.482
On an incline.

52:18.484 --> 52:20.349
Is that a thing?
Is that even...

52:20.351 --> 52:22.285
- It's absolutely a thing.
- "Is that a thing?"

52:22.287 --> 52:23.587
Kids these days, I tell ya.

52:23.589 --> 52:26.356
What do you even see
in this guy?

52:26.358 --> 52:28.691
Are you jealous?

52:28.693 --> 52:31.761
No.

52:31.763 --> 52:33.997
Oh, my God,
you're totally jealous.

52:33.999 --> 52:36.800
I'm not jealous.

52:36.802 --> 52:39.001
- Come here, just a little bit.
- Yeah.

52:39.003 --> 52:40.069
Skye Aitken, you know her?

52:40.071 --> 52:42.471
Skye Aitken, like,
look at like eight o'clock.

52:42.473 --> 52:44.006
- Eight o'clock.
- Over there.

52:44.008 --> 52:45.708
- Da-da-da-da-da!
- Just the eyes, keep the face.

52:45.710 --> 52:48.244
There you go.

52:48.246 --> 52:50.579
Listen, she's...

52:50.581 --> 52:52.647
I mean, you know
her situation, right?

52:52.649 --> 52:53.448
Guys...

52:53.450 --> 52:56.284
It would be amazing
if you could

52:56.286 --> 52:57.953
give us your phone number.

52:57.955 --> 52:59.689
Is this for you
or is this for her?

52:59.691 --> 53:00.990
It's for her,
just write it down.

53:00.992 --> 53:04.959
You know, sir, stop resisting.

53:04.961 --> 53:06.361
- Come on.
- Thank you so much.

53:06.363 --> 53:08.396
I really, really
appreciate this.

53:08.398 --> 53:11.936
Seriously, I will have you
and your whole family arrested.

53:13.303 --> 53:15.937
All right.
You absolutely suck!

53:15.939 --> 53:19.841
- Thank you very much.
- Are you serious?

53:19.843 --> 53:21.342
Hey, do you want us to run

53:21.344 --> 53:23.011
a background check on him,
sweetie?

53:23.013 --> 53:25.782
No, I'm sure his number
will be just fine.

53:29.953 --> 53:32.388
What?

53:33.724 --> 53:36.356
- What's so funny?
- Nothing.

53:36.358 --> 53:38.961
Skye, what's so funny?

53:40.029 --> 53:42.465
She packs a mean punch.

53:43.365 --> 53:44.331
Does it hurt?

53:44.333 --> 53:46.700
Uh, kinda, yeah.

53:46.702 --> 53:47.969
Oh.

53:47.971 --> 53:49.572
Here.

53:56.545 --> 53:57.480
Is that better?

53:58.547 --> 54:00.447
No, it hurts like hell.

54:01.650 --> 54:03.449
I still can't get over the fact

54:03.451 --> 54:07.320
that you work at an airport
but you're afraid of flying.

54:07.322 --> 54:10.356
Well, we have some
very important work

54:10.358 --> 54:11.759
down on the ground.

54:11.761 --> 54:14.393
Bet you've never
unloaded the cargo hold.

54:14.395 --> 54:16.796
Only because the unions
won't allow it.

54:16.798 --> 54:19.701
Otherwise, I'd be
all up on those bags.

54:22.771 --> 54:26.339
I was sick of him lying to me,
so I dumped him.

54:26.341 --> 54:30.575
And then this job came up,
and thought "What the hell?"

54:30.577 --> 54:32.645
Change of scenery
can't be all that bad.

54:32.647 --> 54:36.015
Get away from the ex,
get to see the world.

54:36.017 --> 54:38.850
Sounds like a win-win for me.
What about you?

54:38.852 --> 54:41.620
Do you think
you'll ever go back to school?

54:41.622 --> 54:43.355
I don't know.

54:43.357 --> 54:46.360
Did you drop out because of...

54:48.462 --> 54:50.529
Sorry, I shouldn't have asked.

54:50.531 --> 54:52.966
No, no, look.

54:54.401 --> 54:55.836
I...

54:56.870 --> 54:58.472
Yeah?

55:00.440 --> 55:02.743
I made you something.

55:12.418 --> 55:14.454
Oh, wow.

55:15.121 --> 55:16.821
Thank you.

55:16.823 --> 55:18.889
What is it?

55:18.891 --> 55:21.725
It's the sacred ibis bird.

55:21.727 --> 55:23.460
The sacred what now?

55:23.462 --> 55:26.430
Sacred ibis bird.

55:26.432 --> 55:30.067
In ancient Egypt,
it represented the god Thoth.

55:30.069 --> 55:32.937
When you die, Thoth would
question you on your life

55:32.939 --> 55:34.972
and, if the scales
were balanced,

55:34.974 --> 55:37.944
he'd say your heart
was just and true.

55:39.978 --> 55:42.146
I love it.

55:42.148 --> 55:44.917
No one's ever made
anything for me before.

55:47.452 --> 55:48.588
Thank you.

55:53.859 --> 55:56.928
I think Thoth would say a lot
of good things about you.

56:07.706 --> 56:09.105
Is that all you got?

56:49.813 --> 56:51.145
How do I look?

56:51.147 --> 56:53.915
Great.

56:53.917 --> 56:56.019
You didn't tell your parents
I punched you, did you?

56:58.222 --> 56:59.555
Did you?

57:00.690 --> 57:01.926
Did you?!

57:05.094 --> 57:07.528
I can't get over
the change in Calvin.

57:07.530 --> 57:10.231
What's your secret?
Maybe I can try it on Frank.

57:15.171 --> 57:16.870
Calvin's mom OK?

57:16.872 --> 57:18.840
He didn't tell you?

57:20.742 --> 57:22.211
Of course not.

57:23.612 --> 57:25.648
He had a sister who died.

57:26.949 --> 57:30.585
After that, she just shut down.

57:31.287 --> 57:32.821
That's so sad.

57:34.656 --> 57:36.993
I hope my parents
will be able to cope.

57:48.103 --> 57:49.936
The way I see it,

57:49.938 --> 57:51.872
you have two options.

57:52.907 --> 57:54.740
You either get cancer

57:54.742 --> 57:57.077
or you never, ever
tell her the truth.

57:57.079 --> 57:58.945
I can't keep lying to her.

57:58.947 --> 58:03.749
I don't know, Calvin. I mean,
I like you for who you are,

58:03.751 --> 58:06.986
but what if Izzy only really
likes you for your cancer?

58:06.988 --> 58:09.021
OK.

58:09.023 --> 58:12.057
People really get off
on that shit.

58:12.059 --> 58:13.293
OK, moving on.

58:13.295 --> 58:16.128
What's next on your list,
eh?

58:16.130 --> 58:18.297
What adventure
you gonna take me on?

58:18.299 --> 58:21.300
So there's this one thing,

58:21.302 --> 58:23.302
but it's kind of embarrassing.

58:23.304 --> 58:24.703
I don't think you could say

58:24.705 --> 58:26.240
anything to surprise me anymore,
Skye.

58:28.174 --> 58:30.110
I've never made love.

58:33.613 --> 58:38.283
- Your face!
- Funny.

58:38.285 --> 58:39.917
So what do you say?

58:39.919 --> 58:41.788
Your place or mine?

58:44.257 --> 58:45.790
Skye...

58:45.792 --> 58:48.561
I hate to break it to you...

58:49.263 --> 58:50.696
but you can't wink.

58:51.864 --> 58:54.098
- Yes, I can.
- You cannot wink.

58:54.100 --> 58:57.235
This wink you're doing with
your tongue and your eyes,

58:57.237 --> 58:58.202
it's not a wink.

58:58.204 --> 59:01.639
Like, your tongue comes out,
your eyes droop.

59:01.641 --> 59:02.773
It's unnecessary.

59:02.775 --> 59:05.144
It's like...

59:08.281 --> 59:09.882
You OK?

59:11.317 --> 59:12.751
You don't need
to involve the...

59:16.721 --> 59:18.288
This better not be
a sex dungeon.

59:18.290 --> 59:20.791
That is in the basement.

59:20.793 --> 59:23.326
Calvin Lewis,
as I live and breathe,

59:23.328 --> 59:25.964
I think you just made a joke.

59:28.167 --> 59:29.101
What do you think?

59:31.736 --> 59:33.636
It's a nice crib.

59:33.638 --> 59:35.972
It's for Frank and Lucy's baby.

59:35.974 --> 59:38.277
I'm almost finished.

59:39.877 --> 59:41.177
Wait.

59:41.179 --> 59:42.747
You made this?

59:43.948 --> 59:46.649
Calvin, it's beautiful.

59:46.651 --> 59:48.251
Wait, you made this?

59:48.253 --> 59:52.821
Well, my dad kinda got me
into this when I was a kid.

59:52.823 --> 59:55.625
Helps me take my mind
off things, you know?

59:57.762 --> 59:59.097
I love it.

01:00:02.434 --> 01:00:04.302
How about that sex dungeon?

01:00:19.116 --> 01:00:21.316
Are you sure it's OK
for me to sleep here?

01:00:21.318 --> 01:00:23.751
As long as
you're not afraid of heights.

01:01:06.061 --> 01:01:08.430
Calvin,
are you awake?

01:01:12.168 --> 01:01:13.736
Maybe.

01:02:16.929 --> 01:02:18.496
- This way, this way.
- Over here?

01:02:18.498 --> 01:02:20.931
- Yes, right.
- God, where are you taking me?

01:02:20.933 --> 01:02:22.967
You'll see.
It's just a bit further.

01:02:22.969 --> 01:02:24.169
Yeah, we've got this.

01:02:24.171 --> 01:02:26.171
Ooh,
there's a weird echo.

01:02:26.173 --> 01:02:29.006
- Wait, where are we?
- You'll see. Be patient.

01:02:29.008 --> 01:02:31.108
All will be revealed.

01:02:31.110 --> 01:02:35.012
- Oh, no peeking!
- OK, OK.

01:02:35.014 --> 01:02:36.349
Watch your step.

01:02:39.452 --> 01:02:41.520
OK. You can open your eyes now.

01:02:43.489 --> 01:02:45.458
May I have your boarding pass?

01:02:52.531 --> 01:02:54.030
Straight ahead on your right.

01:02:54.032 --> 01:02:55.967
Flight attendant
will be with you shortly.

01:03:00.439 --> 01:03:02.139
You know, there's no bathroom
in this plane,

01:03:02.141 --> 01:03:04.140
in case you want to join
the Mile High club.

01:03:04.142 --> 01:03:05.541
OK.

01:03:11.584 --> 01:03:14.384
Welcome aboard this flight
from nowhere to nowhere.

01:03:14.386 --> 01:03:16.619
It's a pleasure
to have you with us.

01:03:16.621 --> 01:03:19.921
Your comfort and safety
are our primary concerns,

01:03:19.923 --> 01:03:23.893
so please pay close attention
to the following

01:03:23.895 --> 01:03:25.495
useless information.

01:03:25.497 --> 01:03:28.563
Sir, if you could please
return your seat

01:03:28.565 --> 01:03:30.399
to its upright position.

01:03:30.401 --> 01:03:33.569
To fasten your seatbelt,
place that metal tip

01:03:33.571 --> 01:03:38.240
into the buckle
and tighten the strap.

01:03:38.242 --> 01:03:40.309
If the cabin
pressure should fall,

01:03:40.311 --> 01:03:44.248
panels above your seat will
open, revealing oxygen masks.

01:03:45.983 --> 01:03:49.284
Reach up,
pull that mask in close.

01:03:49.286 --> 01:03:51.419
Place it
over your nose and mouth,

01:03:51.421 --> 01:03:55.424
and then secure it
with the elastic band.

01:03:55.426 --> 01:03:59.994
Place the vest over your
head and fasten the straps

01:03:59.996 --> 01:04:02.130
to the front of the vest.

01:04:04.634 --> 01:04:06.367
Thank you for
not flying with us.

01:04:06.369 --> 01:04:07.669
We hope you enjoy your date.

01:04:07.671 --> 01:04:08.905
Julian.

01:04:14.910 --> 01:04:17.578
- Oh, oh, yeah.
- Yeah, you need, there you go.

01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:19.012
That was awesome.

01:04:19.014 --> 01:04:20.414
Thank you.

01:04:20.416 --> 01:04:23.117
That was... terrifying.

01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:48.609
I'm sorry that the dining
experience isn't 100% authentic.

01:04:48.611 --> 01:04:50.175
It was hard enough bribing
Julian without getting

01:04:50.177 --> 01:04:51.411
the caterers involved.

01:04:51.413 --> 01:04:54.714
OK, I'm just amazed that you
went through so much trouble.

01:04:54.716 --> 01:04:57.183
I wanted you to see what I do.

01:04:57.185 --> 01:05:00.987
You know, you guys can apply
for last minute cancellation

01:05:00.989 --> 01:05:02.554
and you should really
take advantage of that.

01:05:02.556 --> 01:05:05.591
I think you're forgetting
about my whole heights issue.

01:05:05.593 --> 01:05:07.495
I would make sure
you had a good flight.

01:05:09.363 --> 01:05:11.500
Do you think you're gonna stay
in New York?

01:05:12.401 --> 01:05:15.200
For a while, sure.

01:05:15.202 --> 01:05:18.670
I mean, where I'm from, can't go
two steps without everybody

01:05:18.672 --> 01:05:20.205
being in your business.

01:05:20.207 --> 01:05:22.474
- That sounds familiar.
- Mm.

01:05:22.476 --> 01:05:24.443
Yeah, I can't imagine.

01:05:24.445 --> 01:05:27.211
Moving back in with my parents,
we'd probably kill each other.

01:05:27.213 --> 01:05:29.280
Don't get me wrong,
I love them, but...

01:05:29.282 --> 01:05:31.082
Oh, it's not that bad.

01:05:31.084 --> 01:05:35.356
I mean, with work and Skye,
I'm hardly there, so...

01:05:36.757 --> 01:05:38.656
She means a lot to you.

01:05:38.658 --> 01:05:45.597
<i>I think I would fall apart
if I was in her shoes.</i>

01:05:45.599 --> 01:05:47.233
Didn't think you'd show.

01:05:49.235 --> 01:05:51.101
Come.

01:05:51.103 --> 01:05:54.405
I don't know where
she gets the strength.

01:05:54.407 --> 01:05:58.509
Well, she's not as strong
as she looks.

01:05:58.511 --> 01:06:01.379
Well, it's a good thing
she has you then.

01:06:50.126 --> 01:06:52.394
Look, Izzy...

01:06:52.396 --> 01:06:55.431
there's something
I gotta tell you.

01:06:55.433 --> 01:06:57.399
I'm glad that you brought it up

01:06:57.401 --> 01:07:00.269
because, honestly...

01:07:00.271 --> 01:07:01.838
When I moved here, the last
thing I was thinking about

01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:02.838
was meeting somebody

01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:06.375
and I know that we've
never talked about it.

01:07:06.377 --> 01:07:09.514
I didn't want to pry, but...

01:07:13.217 --> 01:07:14.484
<i>I like you, Calvin.</i>

01:07:17.654 --> 01:07:21.557
<i>And before this goes
any further...</i>

01:07:21.559 --> 01:07:22.793
<i>I need to know.</i>

01:07:24.227 --> 01:07:26.161
I don't have cancer.

01:07:27.531 --> 01:07:29.297
I never did.

01:07:30.767 --> 01:07:32.435
<i>Why would
you lie about that?</i>

01:07:33.303 --> 01:07:35.205
I can explain.

01:07:39.809 --> 01:07:42.244
You weren't supposed
to be that guy.

01:07:56.760 --> 01:08:00.160
Son. Are you up?

01:08:00.162 --> 01:08:03.129
- It's been days.
- I'm sick.

01:08:03.131 --> 01:08:05.233
No, you're not.

01:08:07.303 --> 01:08:09.505
Well, I can't keep
covering for you at work.

01:08:10.806 --> 01:08:12.374
Then I'll quit.

01:08:14.342 --> 01:08:16.779
Not this time.

01:08:19.314 --> 01:08:22.381
I've already watched somebody
I love give up on life

01:08:22.384 --> 01:08:24.618
and I'm not gonna do it again.

01:08:24.620 --> 01:08:26.819
You wanna throw it all away,
fine.

01:08:26.821 --> 01:08:29.455
You do it somewhere else.

01:08:29.457 --> 01:08:32.692
- I'll help you pack.
- Dad.

01:08:32.694 --> 01:08:35.862
Dad, look, I'm getting up.

01:08:35.863 --> 01:08:37.733
I'm sorry.

01:08:41.836 --> 01:08:43.337
Listen, son...

01:08:44.805 --> 01:08:49.308
no one deserves to start
their life the way you did.

01:08:49.310 --> 01:08:51.643
But at least you got a start.

01:08:51.645 --> 01:08:53.511
Do something with it.

01:08:53.513 --> 01:08:55.716
Anything.

01:08:59.487 --> 01:09:02.188
I gotta get your mother's
prescription filled..

01:09:28.546 --> 01:09:29.482
Hey.

01:09:32.218 --> 01:09:33.319
Hey.

01:09:42.795 --> 01:09:45.763
Sorry I didn't call sooner.

01:09:45.765 --> 01:09:48.701
So Izzy has a cancer fetish
after all.

01:09:53.304 --> 01:09:54.437
I missed you.

01:09:54.439 --> 01:09:57.308
- Yeah, yeah.
- I did.

01:09:57.943 --> 01:09:59.009
Really?

01:09:59.011 --> 01:10:02.247
Like on a scale of one to ten?

01:10:06.751 --> 01:10:08.787
Your mom says
you've been in here for days.

01:10:10.990 --> 01:10:13.923
I think I'm just gonna lay here

01:10:13.925 --> 01:10:16.559
and lick my wounds
until the end of time.

01:10:16.561 --> 01:10:19.028
I see that kid again,
I swear to God...

01:10:19.030 --> 01:10:20.699
No, it wasn't his fault.

01:10:21.399 --> 01:10:22.934
I wanted it.

01:10:23.768 --> 01:10:25.503
I just...

01:10:26.905 --> 01:10:30.707
didn't think it
would be so quick.

01:10:30.709 --> 01:10:32.541
I mean, he looks like he knows
what he's doing but...

01:10:32.543 --> 01:10:34.846
OK, yeah.
No, I don't need the details.

01:10:38.816 --> 01:10:40.716
Come on.

01:10:40.718 --> 01:10:42.586
Let's get you out of here,
I want to show you something.

01:10:43.387 --> 01:10:44.820
Keep it in your pants, Calvin.

01:10:44.822 --> 01:10:47.791
It's important.

01:10:53.362 --> 01:10:54.932
Come on.

01:11:02.038 --> 01:11:04.072
You didn't dig me
a grave, did you?

01:11:04.074 --> 01:11:07.677
I mean, I know I went AWOL
for a few days but still.

01:11:13.850 --> 01:11:17.551
It's my twin sister.

01:11:17.553 --> 01:11:21.457
We were in a car accident
when I was eight years old.

01:11:23.793 --> 01:11:25.659
<i>It was my mom driving.</i>

01:11:25.661 --> 01:11:28.698
It wasn't her fault but...

01:11:31.366 --> 01:11:33.536
Why didn't you tell me?

01:11:34.971 --> 01:11:39.973
It's not something
we really talk about.

01:11:39.975 --> 01:11:41.875
You know, I think it would

01:11:41.877 --> 01:11:44.912
have been easier on my mom
if we both died.

01:11:44.914 --> 01:11:46.746
Don't say that.

01:11:46.748 --> 01:11:49.384
I'm like a constant reminder.

01:11:50.752 --> 01:11:54.087
Birthdays must have sucked.

01:11:54.089 --> 01:11:56.456
I haven't had one since then.

01:11:56.458 --> 01:11:57.759
What?

01:11:59.394 --> 01:12:01.494
Would have been
too hard on my mom.

01:12:01.496 --> 01:12:03.697
Everyone deserves a birthday.

01:12:05.033 --> 01:12:06.735
Close your eyes.

01:12:08.435 --> 01:12:09.535
Why?

01:12:09.537 --> 01:12:11.305
Just close 'em.

01:12:15.009 --> 01:12:17.378
OK, now open them.

01:12:18.112 --> 01:12:20.579
Happy birthday, Calvin.

01:12:20.581 --> 01:12:22.951
Come on, let's go.

01:12:26.020 --> 01:12:27.585
She looks like you.

01:12:27.587 --> 01:12:30.055
I mean, a better-looking
version, like, way...

01:12:30.057 --> 01:12:32.760
OK, yeah, yeah.

01:12:37.797 --> 01:12:40.631
What was college like?

01:12:40.633 --> 01:12:44.337
Well, I dropped out
after one semester, so...

01:12:45.438 --> 01:12:47.005
Why do you ask?

01:12:47.007 --> 01:12:50.443
Just been thinking about
all the stuff I won't get to do.

01:12:52.478 --> 01:12:53.546
Was it fun?

01:12:54.681 --> 01:12:57.582
I didn't really... fit in.

01:12:57.584 --> 01:12:59.851
Ooh, shocker.

01:12:59.853 --> 01:13:03.655
I mean, I didn't intend
on staying home this long.

01:13:04.891 --> 01:13:08.860
But you just kinda
get sucked in, you know?

01:13:08.862 --> 01:13:12.632
Everything's so... familiar.

01:13:19.872 --> 01:13:21.805
What's this?

01:13:21.807 --> 01:13:26.109
This is... was
my symptoms journal.

01:13:26.111 --> 01:13:29.646
I've been keeping one
since I was a kid.

01:13:29.648 --> 01:13:32.549
- Why?
- I don't know.

01:13:32.551 --> 01:13:35.785
I guess I always kinda had
this feeling I was gonna die.

01:13:35.787 --> 01:13:38.489
Hate to break it to ya.

01:13:39.857 --> 01:13:43.827
At college, I kept having
these panic attacks,

01:13:43.829 --> 01:13:46.763
like, all the time.

01:13:46.765 --> 01:13:49.798
I... I didn't drop out.

01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:52.436
I flunked, couldn't handle it.

01:13:53.604 --> 01:13:55.571
Yeah.

01:13:55.573 --> 01:13:58.174
Anyway, reason I'm showing you

01:13:58.176 --> 01:14:01.412
the journal is that
I have stopped.

01:14:02.747 --> 01:14:04.615
Thanks to you.

01:14:15.226 --> 01:14:16.726
I made a new one.

01:14:19.763 --> 01:14:22.497
When I started going
to support groups,

01:14:22.499 --> 01:14:24.166
everyone had the same list.

01:14:24.168 --> 01:14:27.902
I wanted to be different,
so I did a bunch of stuff

01:14:27.904 --> 01:14:30.272
that no one's ever
gonna remember.

01:14:30.274 --> 01:14:33.708
But I don't have
much time left,

01:14:33.710 --> 01:14:38.980
so... I don't want to waste
any more of it doing dumb shit.

01:14:38.982 --> 01:14:41.683
Don't talk like that.

01:14:41.685 --> 01:14:43.720
- Like what?
- Like you're not gonna make it.

01:14:52.128 --> 01:14:54.164
I'm going to the powder room,
give me 50 bucks.

01:14:55.932 --> 01:14:57.999
<i>Breakfast at Tiffany's.</i>

01:14:58.001 --> 01:14:59.700
Oh, don't tell me.

01:14:59.702 --> 01:15:02.104
Calvin Lewis, you have
a lot of living to do.

01:15:10.879 --> 01:15:13.116
Hey, Frank. What's up?

01:15:13.915 --> 01:15:15.550
No.

01:15:16.151 --> 01:15:17.650
Really?

01:15:17.652 --> 01:15:19.286
OK. Oh, my God.

01:15:19.288 --> 01:15:20.887
Yeah.

01:15:20.889 --> 01:15:23.657
Hey, Lucy.

01:15:23.659 --> 01:15:26.926
OK, yeah, I'll see you in a bit.

01:15:26.928 --> 01:15:27.927
Amazing.

01:15:27.929 --> 01:15:29.695
OK. OK. Bye-bye.

01:15:31.766 --> 01:15:34.836
- Oh, my God! Are you OK?
- Skye, Skye!

01:15:57.691 --> 01:15:59.358
Any change?

01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:01.195
No.

01:16:03.997 --> 01:16:06.533
I'm sorry about this morning.

01:16:08.769 --> 01:16:10.871
I needed to hear it.

01:16:14.875 --> 01:16:16.875
I think I'm gonna try
and find my own place.

01:16:16.877 --> 01:16:18.745
You don't have to move out.

01:16:20.147 --> 01:16:21.648
I know.

01:16:25.651 --> 01:16:26.986
It's a girl.

01:16:52.378 --> 01:16:54.346
Did she wake up?

01:16:55.381 --> 01:16:58.117
Just for a few minutes.

01:17:00.686 --> 01:17:02.854
He's her favorite.

01:17:06.425 --> 01:17:08.791
Will you sit with her
for a minute?

01:17:08.793 --> 01:17:11.297
- I could use some air.
- Of course.

01:17:28.912 --> 01:17:29.981
Skye.

01:17:30.747 --> 01:17:32.183
Hey.

01:17:33.751 --> 01:17:35.053
Calvin.

01:17:38.689 --> 01:17:41.158
No, no, no, don't do that.

01:17:45.463 --> 01:17:47.330
Cute wink.

01:17:47.332 --> 01:17:50.134
I've been practicing.

01:18:00.177 --> 01:18:02.211
It's that damn cat scene.

01:18:07.050 --> 01:18:08.450
Can we come in?

01:18:08.452 --> 01:18:10.152
Oh, my God, you have a baby.

01:18:10.154 --> 01:18:12.954
Yes, we do.

01:18:12.956 --> 01:18:13.990
Do you wanna hold her?

01:18:22.798 --> 01:18:24.399
Does she have a name?

01:18:24.401 --> 01:18:26.066
This is Amber.

01:18:26.068 --> 01:18:28.871
Least you could do
was name the kid after me.

01:18:31.340 --> 01:18:34.175
Well, um, Lucy
and I were talking

01:18:34.177 --> 01:18:37.511
and it would
mean a lot to us

01:18:37.513 --> 01:18:39.913
if you would both
do us the honor of

01:18:39.915 --> 01:18:41.348
being Amber's godparents.

01:18:41.350 --> 01:18:46.287
You do know I'm not long
for this world, right?

01:18:46.289 --> 01:18:49.991
We couldn't think of a better
role model for our daughter.

01:18:53.929 --> 01:18:57.230
She's gonna hear all
about you, I promise you that.

01:18:57.232 --> 01:18:59.134
Maybe just
the good stuff.

01:19:02.370 --> 01:19:04.272
What do you say, Cal?

01:19:06.474 --> 01:19:07.842
Cal.

01:19:13.048 --> 01:19:14.313
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:19:14.315 --> 01:19:16.215
It's OK, it's OK,
it's OK, it's OK.

01:19:16.217 --> 01:19:20.018
It's OK, I got you,
I got you, I got you.

01:19:20.020 --> 01:19:21.389
It's OK, it's OK.

01:19:23.258 --> 01:19:24.326
I got you.

01:19:27.828 --> 01:19:31.797
Hey, hey, hey.
You good? You good?

01:19:31.799 --> 01:19:35.267
Take a breath, come on.

01:19:35.269 --> 01:19:37.369
Let's go back inside.

01:19:37.371 --> 01:19:38.836
No.

01:19:38.838 --> 01:19:40.272
Don't do that.

01:19:40.274 --> 01:19:43.910
I can't watch her die.

01:19:44.945 --> 01:19:47.446
This isn't about you, OK?

01:19:47.448 --> 01:19:49.147
And what you think you can
or can't do.

01:19:49.149 --> 01:19:51.215
This is about her.

01:19:51.217 --> 01:19:53.987
And she needs you
in her corner right now.

01:19:55.855 --> 01:19:57.491
All right?

01:22:25.601 --> 01:22:28.000
"And had you not
lost all your sheep

01:22:28.002 --> 01:22:30.136
brought through the country
of El Dorado,

01:22:30.138 --> 01:22:33.005
then you wouldn't be here
eating preserved citrons

01:22:33.007 --> 01:22:33.939
and pistachio nuts."

01:22:33.941 --> 01:22:36.576
"Excellently observed,"
answered Candide,

01:22:36.578 --> 01:22:38.344
"but we must
cultivate our garden."

01:23:08.141 --> 01:23:10.010
You made me a coffin.

01:23:11.746 --> 01:23:13.547
Is that weird?

01:23:14.748 --> 01:23:16.450
We're way past weird.

01:23:24.659 --> 01:23:25.723
Please tell me you're joking.

01:23:25.725 --> 01:23:27.559
What, you don't like it?

01:23:27.561 --> 01:23:29.527
Calvin, it's a bloody
death trap.

01:23:29.529 --> 01:23:30.595
I know.

01:23:30.597 --> 01:23:32.165
This was just the prototype.

01:23:37.203 --> 01:23:38.571
For real this time.

01:24:22.615 --> 01:24:24.315
It's perfect.

01:24:29.454 --> 01:24:31.422
Do you wanna try it out?

01:24:35.794 --> 01:24:37.729
Not just yet.

01:25:03.587 --> 01:25:05.320
So what are you
gonna do about Izzy?

01:25:05.322 --> 01:25:07.658
- Skye...
- Don't "Skye" me.

01:25:09.126 --> 01:25:11.626
Being a wuss
got you into this mess.

01:25:11.628 --> 01:25:14.163
Well, being a wuss
and meeting me.

01:25:17.466 --> 01:25:20.134
But if you're gonna
dig yourself out of it,

01:25:20.136 --> 01:25:22.739
you're gonna have
to do it alone.

01:25:25.374 --> 01:25:27.374
I'm not sure what's
on the other side of this,

01:25:27.376 --> 01:25:32.181
but... wouldn't bank on
having me around to help.

01:25:44.660 --> 01:25:47.163
Stay. Join us.

01:26:02.209 --> 01:26:06.214
So, guess now we just wait.

01:26:09.317 --> 01:26:11.217
I have to say,

01:26:11.219 --> 01:26:14.656
thought once I'd made up
with Ashley and the girls...

01:26:16.625 --> 01:26:20.260
and once I put in a good word
for Calvin with Izzy...

01:26:21.630 --> 01:26:24.733
once I told you guys
how much I love you...

01:26:28.937 --> 01:26:31.205
I really thought
they'd come for me.

01:26:32.874 --> 01:26:36.410
Well, maybe they're
still waiting.

01:26:37.210 --> 01:26:39.243
Yeah.

01:26:39.245 --> 01:26:40.781
Maybe they're having
second thoughts.

01:26:45.319 --> 01:26:47.187
What do you think, Calvin?

01:26:48.522 --> 01:26:50.623
Think they're having
second thoughts?

01:26:52.926 --> 01:26:54.993
Maybe.

01:26:54.995 --> 01:26:57.196
Yeah.

01:26:58.699 --> 01:27:00.768
Maybe.

01:33:18.100 --> 01:33:23.100
