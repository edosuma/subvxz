WEBVTT

00:02.042 --> 00:03.167
Full speed ahead, Captain.

00:03.292 --> 00:05.000
NARRATOR:
...on <i>Beyond Oak Island...</i>

00:05.167 --> 00:07.083
<i>Well, we'd love to have
you guys come back down.</i>

00:07.208 --> 00:08.542
RICK:
There you go.

00:08.708 --> 00:10.292
According to the two survivors
of the shipwreck,

00:10.417 --> 00:13.333
the <i>Whydah</i> carried
five tons of treasure.

00:13.458 --> 00:15.833
-Let's find that mother lode.
-Yeah. I think he's on it.

00:15.958 --> 00:16.958
Get the divers ready.

00:17.042 --> 00:18.083
JEFF:
Roger that.

00:18.208 --> 00:19.667
MATTY:
Diver's in the water.

00:19.792 --> 00:21.000
TONY: We know
our time is finite.

00:22.333 --> 00:24.167
We have to come up
with something this time.

00:25.708 --> 00:27.000
-We got a hit.
-Got a hit.

00:27.167 --> 00:29.167
BARRY:
This has been undisturbed
for 300 years.

00:29.292 --> 00:31.250
MATTY:
Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:31.375 --> 00:33.250
-(Tony laughing)
-Let's go!

00:35.042 --> 00:36.708
All the while
we were growing up,

00:36.833 --> 00:40.667
my brother and I were fascinated
with finding treasure.

00:40.833 --> 00:41.917
RICK:
Pirate treasure,

00:42.042 --> 00:43.833
cursed treasure.

00:43.958 --> 00:45.667
Civil War gold.

00:45.750 --> 00:48.500
-(laughter)
-Since then,
our work on Oak Island

00:48.583 --> 00:50.917
has shown us
there's a world of mysteries...

00:51.042 --> 00:53.167
-Whoa.
-...waiting to be explored.

00:53.250 --> 00:56.833
RICK:
So we like to reach out
to other treasure hunters.

00:56.917 --> 00:59.083
X marks the spot, right there.
Brilliant.

00:59.208 --> 01:01.333
-MARTY: We want to hear
their stories...
-That's right.

01:01.500 --> 01:03.875
-...and share our insights.
-"Ill-gotten gains."

01:04.000 --> 01:05.250
-RICK: And who knows...
-GARY: I got it.

01:05.375 --> 01:07.625
...maybe we can help them
with their search.

01:07.750 --> 01:08.750
MARTY:
Not only in America.

01:08.875 --> 01:10.125
Wow. That is gold.

01:10.250 --> 01:12.333
-RICK: But all over the world.
-Yeah!

01:12.417 --> 01:14.292
MARTY:
<i>Beyond Oak Island.</i>

01:23.625 --> 01:25.167
RICK:
So, guys,

01:25.292 --> 01:27.458
the purpose of this meeting
is really quite simple.

01:27.542 --> 01:30.792
Barry and Brandon Clifford
have reached out again.

01:30.875 --> 01:33.167
Uh...
He's starting to smile already.

01:33.333 --> 01:35.083
-(chuckles)
-RICK: You know,

01:35.208 --> 01:39.167
they have hinted
at the idea of going back

01:39.333 --> 01:41.958
and having another crack
at the <i>Whydah.</i>

01:42.042 --> 01:44.333
This is one
that I've really, really,

01:44.500 --> 01:46.167
really wanted
to get another crack at.

01:46.333 --> 01:48.583
What this team has done,

01:48.708 --> 01:51.833
what Barry
and Brandon Clifford have done

01:51.958 --> 01:53.833
on the <i>Whydah</i> site
is unparalleled.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.708
I mean, we said it last time--
this is the only documented

01:56.833 --> 02:00.167
pirate treasure being brought up
and identified in the world.

02:00.292 --> 02:02.625
-Yeah.
-And, I mean,
that alone puts them...

02:02.708 --> 02:04.375
(whistles)
...right up top.

02:04.542 --> 02:07.833
So, to have another chance
to get on that site

02:07.917 --> 02:09.417
and potentially find
more treasure,

02:09.542 --> 02:11.500
and I'll say more treasure
'cause you remember last time

02:11.625 --> 02:12.833
we found that coin.

02:12.958 --> 02:14.375
Yeah, and it's,
and it's the allure

02:14.542 --> 02:16.958
of perhaps even
the greatest treasure, right?

02:17.083 --> 02:18.042
Maybe something that they--

02:18.167 --> 02:19.667
something really spectacular

02:19.750 --> 02:22.000
that they haven't found
any examples of yet.

02:22.083 --> 02:23.333
Yes.

02:23.500 --> 02:25.500
Well, guys,
welcome to my backyard.

02:25.625 --> 02:27.000
Cape Cod.

02:27.125 --> 02:28.833
NARRATOR:
In June of 2022,

02:28.958 --> 02:33.042
Rick Lagina, along with
Matty Blake and Tony Sampson,

02:33.208 --> 02:35.750
traveled to Matty's
home state of Massachusetts

02:35.875 --> 02:39.500
to join renowned salvage divers
Barry and Brandon Clifford

02:39.583 --> 02:42.375
on their ongoing excavation
of the legendary pirate ship

02:42.542 --> 02:44.250
known as the <i>Whydah Gally...</i>

02:44.375 --> 02:46.000
Diver's in the water.

02:46.125 --> 02:48.458
...which sank just off
the coast of Cape Cod

02:48.542 --> 02:50.833
in 1717.

02:51.750 --> 02:53.750
SIMON:
The pirate crew on
the <i>Whydah</i> was probably

02:53.875 --> 02:57.250
one of the most diverse pirate
crews of the entire Golden Age.

02:57.375 --> 03:00.000
You had British pirates,
French, Portuguese, Dutch,

03:00.125 --> 03:02.042
and, most notably,

03:02.208 --> 03:04.083
about one-third of
all the pirates on the <i>Whydah</i>

03:04.208 --> 03:05.667
were African.

03:05.792 --> 03:08.875
And this is because
of Captain Samuel Bellamy.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.250
Hoist her up!

03:11.875 --> 03:14.333
NARRATOR:
Known for
his striking dark hair,

03:14.458 --> 03:17.250
"Black Sam" Bellamy
was an Englishman

03:17.375 --> 03:20.625
who became one of the most
notorious and unique buccaneers

03:20.750 --> 03:24.250
during the Golden Age of Piracy
in the Americas.

03:24.375 --> 03:27.083
In less than two years of
plundering on the high seas,

03:27.208 --> 03:30.208
Black Sam commandeered
more than 50 ships,

03:30.333 --> 03:31.833
accumulating
a massive treasure...

03:31.958 --> 03:33.208
Full sail!

03:33.375 --> 03:35.250
...and a diverse crew
along the way.

03:35.375 --> 03:37.583
However,
his greatest conquest was

03:37.708 --> 03:40.750
the <i>Whydah Gally--</i>
an English slave ship.

03:40.875 --> 03:43.042
SIMON:
When Samuel Bellamy
took the <i>Whydah,</i>

03:43.208 --> 03:46.083
it did have many Africans
on it, enslaved people,

03:46.208 --> 03:47.833
and so Samuel Bellamy
allowed them

03:47.958 --> 03:49.375
to become pirates on his crew.

03:49.500 --> 03:51.500
It was actually
quite democratic.

03:51.583 --> 03:53.333
He always made sure
that all pirates had

03:53.458 --> 03:55.625
equal votes
on every single matter.

03:55.750 --> 03:57.875
And every single person
in his crew

03:58.042 --> 03:59.458
very much got their equal share.

03:59.542 --> 04:04.125
NARRATOR:
But on April 26, 1717,

04:04.208 --> 04:06.667
as the <i>Whydah</i> sailed
toward Cape Cod,

04:06.792 --> 04:09.333
it was caught in
a devastating nor'easter,

04:09.500 --> 04:11.708
causing it to
break apart and sink.

04:11.875 --> 04:14.208
Its massive treasure

04:14.333 --> 04:16.917
and most of the crew,
including Black Sam Bellamy,

04:17.042 --> 04:19.167
were lost to the sea.

04:19.250 --> 04:23.667
SIMON:
The <i>Whydah</i> had hordes of goods
that went down when it crashed.

04:23.792 --> 04:25.333
But most importantly,

04:25.458 --> 04:27.167
according to the two survivors
of the shipwreck,

04:27.333 --> 04:32.792
the <i>Whydah</i> carried five tons of
gold, silver and various jewels

04:32.875 --> 04:36.000
packed away in 50-pound bags
all throughout the ship.

04:36.125 --> 04:38.250
NARRATOR:
The <i>Whydah</i> and its riches

04:38.375 --> 04:42.000
eluded discovery
for more than 260 years

04:42.167 --> 04:44.000
until renowned explorer
Barry Clifford

04:44.125 --> 04:46.333
and his partner
John F. Kennedy Jr.

04:46.417 --> 04:49.667
discovered
its massive bell in 1985.

04:49.792 --> 04:51.500
Since then,

04:51.625 --> 04:54.208
Barry has acquired the
exclusive rights to the wreck

04:54.375 --> 04:56.458
and, along with his son Brandon,

04:56.542 --> 04:59.667
works every year to recover
the remains of the <i>Whydah</i>

04:59.750 --> 05:01.167
and her crew,

05:01.292 --> 05:03.208
which they preserve
and display for the public

05:03.333 --> 05:05.833
in two different museums.

05:06.708 --> 05:08.833
The treasure
of the <i>Whydah</i> is the story

05:08.917 --> 05:12.125
of these people
experimenting in democracy.

05:12.250 --> 05:14.375
That story needs to be told

05:14.542 --> 05:16.500
a million times,
over and over again.

05:16.625 --> 05:20.708
And this is why it's been
so important to us.

05:20.875 --> 05:22.667
It must be preserved.

05:22.750 --> 05:24.708
This thing just
keeps on giving, right?

05:24.833 --> 05:26.500
-That's right.
-54 different ships

05:26.583 --> 05:29.500
were-were perhaps
represented on that ship?

05:29.583 --> 05:31.417
TONY:
Exactly, Marty.

05:31.542 --> 05:33.875
And as to your point
we do not know what's on her.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.167
You know, like with all
the other Spanish ships,

05:36.250 --> 05:37.417
you know, they had a manifest...

05:37.542 --> 05:38.792
-Yeah.
-...so you assumed

05:38.875 --> 05:39.875
what you were looking for

05:40.042 --> 05:41.500
would be part of that manifest.

05:41.625 --> 05:45.167
But this, this is just,
the mind goes everywhere

05:45.333 --> 05:47.667
'cause it could be
anything that's down there.

05:47.792 --> 05:49.875
Right. That's got to make
a dive really fun. (chuckles)

05:50.042 --> 05:51.500
Uh... it makes me pretty happy.

05:51.583 --> 05:53.333
NARRATOR:
During their recent trip

05:53.417 --> 05:55.167
to work with Barry and Brandon

05:55.250 --> 05:57.583
in the waters just off
the coast of Cape Cod...

06:00.375 --> 06:03.333
...Tony, Matty and Rick
helped Brandon and Barry

06:03.417 --> 06:04.875
find possible timbers
from the wreck...

06:07.000 --> 06:08.250
...a metal spoon

06:08.375 --> 06:12.875
and a silver real coin
which was dated to 1710.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.667
The other thing
that's interesting to me is

06:15.833 --> 06:21.333
the duration of time
from when Barry first decided to

06:21.417 --> 06:25.750
pursue this dream
of finding the <i>Whydah.</i>

06:25.875 --> 06:28.000
40 years.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.500
-40 years, that's
a lifetime's worth of work.
-MATTY: Yeah.

06:32.583 --> 06:36.875
And it has grown into something,

06:37.000 --> 06:38.500
I would think, far bigger

06:38.667 --> 06:41.042
than what he had
initially thought, right?

06:41.208 --> 06:43.583
I mean, this thing has it all.

06:43.708 --> 06:45.667
-And I...
-MARTY: You know,
I can't help but think

06:45.833 --> 06:48.458
when you say that, that almost
all of that applies to you

06:48.583 --> 06:50.458
(laughs) on this search
right here.

06:50.542 --> 06:52.458
You started after this
when you were 12.

06:52.542 --> 06:54.042
How many years
does that make it?

06:54.167 --> 06:56.083
-(all laughing)
-That's... Stop.

06:56.208 --> 06:58.125
-Stop.
-Don't do that math.

06:58.250 --> 07:00.542
-Don't do that math.
-Shall we do
the arithmetic here?

07:00.667 --> 07:03.333
No, stop the math, please.
Stop the math.

07:03.458 --> 07:05.333
Well, you know,
the last time we spoke with

07:05.500 --> 07:06.833
Barry and Brandon,

07:06.958 --> 07:10.000
I know that Barry
kept talking about

07:10.167 --> 07:13.292
him getting closer and closer
to maybe finding

07:13.375 --> 07:14.708
where he believes
the treasure would be.

07:14.875 --> 07:16.500
-Let's, let's talk to them.
-MARTY: Absolutely.

07:16.583 --> 07:18.458
-To see what they have in mind?
-RICK: Yep.

07:18.542 --> 07:19.917
-All right.
-Let's see what they have
to say.

07:21.750 --> 07:23.458
-Hello, gentlemen.
-TONY: Hi, guys.
-MATTY: Hi, guys.

07:23.542 --> 07:26.292
Hey, how are you?

07:26.375 --> 07:29.208
Good. We've got Tony here
and Matty and myself

07:29.375 --> 07:30.875
and Marty, of course, and, uh...

07:31.042 --> 07:33.958
we know that you want
to talk about something.

07:34.083 --> 07:35.500
What might that be?

07:35.625 --> 07:37.792
<i>Well, we'd love to have
you guys come back down.</i>

07:37.875 --> 07:39.583
<i>If you're able.</i>

07:39.708 --> 07:41.458
-RICK: There you go.
<i>-We're gonna be headed out soon</i>

07:41.583 --> 07:43.542
and we'd love
for you guys to join us.

07:43.708 --> 07:45.000
RICK:
You know, guys,

07:45.167 --> 07:46.375
it's incredibly kind of you

07:46.542 --> 07:47.958
to make such a generous offer.

07:48.042 --> 07:52.167
Can you run through
exactly what the plan is?

07:52.292 --> 07:53.833
How is this going to evolve?

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
We're actually
gonna be working at

07:56.125 --> 07:57.792
the main point of the shipwreck,

07:57.875 --> 07:59.708
<i>where the shipwreck
was discovered,</i>

07:59.833 --> 08:02.125
<i>and we're gonna go work
in this area known as</i>

08:02.208 --> 08:03.583
<i>the cannon pile area.</i>

08:03.708 --> 08:05.875
<i>That's where
a number of years ago</i>

08:06.000 --> 08:08.833
<i>we've recovered this massive
concretion of cannons</i>

08:09.000 --> 08:10.667
<i>that weighed about
10,000 pounds.</i>

08:10.792 --> 08:13.667
<i>And beneath
that massive concretion,</i>

08:13.833 --> 08:17.208
we have reason to believe that
there might be all sorts of

08:17.375 --> 08:19.583
<i>artifacts below that layer.</i>

08:19.708 --> 08:22.083
<i>So we're gonna go set up
right on that spot</i>

08:22.208 --> 08:23.208
<i>and get to work out there.</i>

08:24.542 --> 08:26.500
NARRATOR:
As the <i>Whydah</i> began to sink

08:26.625 --> 08:30.667
in 1717, it capsized
and broke apart,

08:30.792 --> 08:33.250
causing much of
the treasure on board,

08:33.375 --> 08:35.667
which was kept
in 50-pound containers,

08:35.792 --> 08:38.167
to become buried
beneath the massive cannons

08:38.292 --> 08:39.792
on the ocean floor.

08:39.917 --> 08:42.500
This prompted
the English cartographer

08:42.583 --> 08:45.042
Cyprian Southack,
who not only witnessed

08:45.167 --> 08:46.542
the <i>Whydah's</i> sinking

08:46.708 --> 08:49.375
but also created
a survey map of the wreckage,

08:49.542 --> 08:52.333
to believe that if
the cannons could be found,

08:52.458 --> 08:54.750
it would lead
to the mother lode.

08:55.625 --> 08:57.250
So Southack said,

08:57.375 --> 09:00.875
"The riches with the guns
will be buried in the sand."

09:01.042 --> 09:02.708
<i>That's a big clue</i>

09:02.833 --> 09:06.500
<i>because we know where we found
the cannon pile, so...</i>

09:06.625 --> 09:09.250
I really think
we're on to something.

09:09.375 --> 09:10.833
-Wow.
-Fantastic.

09:10.958 --> 09:12.458
-That sounds great.
-MATTY: Wow.

09:12.542 --> 09:14.417
No, that sounds really,
really exciting.

09:14.542 --> 09:16.375
RICK:
Well, Barry, Brandon, again,

09:16.542 --> 09:18.458
I want to say thank you
for the generous offer

09:18.583 --> 09:22.000
of us coming out again,
but I-I don't think

09:22.167 --> 09:24.500
that Marty and I are going
to be able to free ourselves

09:24.625 --> 09:26.333
from the island

09:26.458 --> 09:28.500
because, quite frankly, we've
got a big project here, too.

09:28.625 --> 09:32.667
So... But I do know,
as I turn to my right,

09:32.792 --> 09:36.375
the two gentlemen here,
grins spread across their faces.

09:36.500 --> 09:38.458
So I think Matty and Tony

09:38.583 --> 09:39.667
certainly would be
quite willing to

09:39.833 --> 09:42.917
accept your kind offer and I,

09:43.042 --> 09:45.667
I would think
they'll get down there ASAP.

09:45.792 --> 09:47.667
That sounds great.

09:47.792 --> 09:49.750
Maybe next time you can join us.

09:49.875 --> 09:51.667
We'd love to have Matty
and Tony come down.

09:51.833 --> 09:54.417
That's, that's
absolutely perfect.

09:54.542 --> 09:56.833
We'll look forward
to more revelations.

09:56.958 --> 09:59.083
Sounds like we could be on
top of a mother lode here,

09:59.208 --> 10:00.208
so let's go.

10:00.333 --> 10:01.792
All right.

10:01.875 --> 10:02.917
I'm really looking forward
to this, guys.

10:03.042 --> 10:04.625
I can barely
contain myself here.

10:04.708 --> 10:06.833
All right, thanks, guys.
I'll be in touch.

10:06.958 --> 10:08.667

TONY:
This is gonna be epic.

We've got a perfect morning.

10:20.583 --> 10:21.958

-Good to see you.
Welcome back.
-Good morning.

10:24.417 --> 10:27.833
NARRATOR:
Two days after their meeting
in the Oak Island war room,

10:27.958 --> 10:29.708
Matty Blake
and diver Tony Sampson

10:29.833 --> 10:32.000
have traveled some 500 miles

10:32.125 --> 10:34.792
southwest to Cape Cod,
Massachusetts.

10:34.875 --> 10:36.083
MATTY: Permission
to come aboard, Captain?

10:36.208 --> 10:37.167
Come on aboard.

10:37.292 --> 10:38.833
-All right.
-TONY: Excellent.

10:38.958 --> 10:40.833
NARRATOR: After meeting up
with Captain Jeff Spiegel,

10:40.917 --> 10:43.417
they now have
a short journey down the coast

10:43.542 --> 10:45.500
to join Barry
and Brandon Clifford

10:45.625 --> 10:47.792
on their state-of-the-art
salvage vessel

10:47.875 --> 10:49.875
known as the <i>Vast Explorer</i>

10:50.000 --> 10:52.333
to search for artifacts
and valuables

10:52.417 --> 10:55.792
connected to the legendary
18th century pirate wreck

10:55.875 --> 10:58.167
known as the <i>Whydah Gally.</i>

10:58.250 --> 11:02.292
MATTY:
It's so great to be back home
with my good mate Tony Sampson.

11:02.375 --> 11:03.833
Barry thinks he has a spot

11:04.000 --> 11:07.208
potentially over
the mother lode of the <i>Whydah</i>

11:07.375 --> 11:09.875
and we might have a chance
to get out there

11:10.000 --> 11:11.458
and be part of that discovery.

11:11.583 --> 11:13.333
Captain Jeff?

11:13.417 --> 11:14.833
-JEFF: Yes.
-Hey, buddy.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.917
Uh, what's the weather today?
Have you checked?

11:18.042 --> 11:19.875
Well, it's a beautiful morning,

11:20.042 --> 11:23.583
but like typical New England
weather, it's gonna change.

11:23.708 --> 11:27.083
The weather here
can change in an instant.

11:27.208 --> 11:28.500
The sea is beautiful.

11:28.583 --> 11:31.292
Right now it's very tranquil.

11:31.375 --> 11:33.667
This can all change
in the blink of an eye,

11:33.792 --> 11:35.083
as it did for the <i>Whydah.</i>

11:35.208 --> 11:36.750
So we're hoping

11:36.875 --> 11:38.792
that everything stays like this.

11:38.875 --> 11:39.917
Let's find that mother lode.

11:40.042 --> 11:41.208
Full speed ahead, Captain.

11:54.125 --> 11:56.750
-Morning, Brandon.
-BRANDON: Hey, guys.

11:56.875 --> 11:58.500
MATTY:
Let's do some diving.
What do you think?

11:58.583 --> 12:00.250
(chuckling):
All right.

12:00.375 --> 12:02.250
BRANDON:
My dad's very excited
to go to this area

12:02.375 --> 12:03.917
where we're gonna be working.

12:04.042 --> 12:07.333
We've recovered these large,
large, massive cannons

12:07.458 --> 12:09.000
that weighed
about 10,000 pounds,

12:09.167 --> 12:11.500
and we've never seen
what's below it.

12:11.625 --> 12:13.167
-You all right, Matty?
-Yep.

12:13.333 --> 12:15.292
BRANDON:
This is the main
focal point, you know,

12:15.375 --> 12:17.958
"the guns that would be
with the riches in the sand,"

12:18.042 --> 12:20.542
so I'm excited
to go dive in this area

12:20.667 --> 12:22.167
and see what the sand is like.

12:22.292 --> 12:23.875
-So good to see you again.
-Good to see you.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
MATTY:
Wow. It's great to be back,

12:26.083 --> 12:28.500
well, home, kind of,
for me, but...

12:28.583 --> 12:30.625
Man, this is a much
different vessel

12:30.708 --> 12:32.500
than what we were on before.

12:32.625 --> 12:35.458
BRANDON:
This dive is different
because we're really

12:35.583 --> 12:37.500
at the main point
of the shipwreck.

12:37.625 --> 12:39.708
You know, the original
discovery site,

12:39.833 --> 12:41.125
what we call Data May.

12:41.208 --> 12:42.500
Could the mother lode be
in this area?

12:42.625 --> 12:44.500
According to Southack,

12:44.625 --> 12:46.625
he said, "the riches
with the guns

12:46.708 --> 12:47.875
will be buried in the sand."

12:48.042 --> 12:50.208
And this is where we found

12:50.375 --> 12:52.000
-50 guns right in this area.
-MATTY: Oh, right.

12:52.083 --> 12:55.000
So we're expecting to find
artifacts here.

12:55.083 --> 12:56.958
So, according to the research
you did, what's the plan?

12:57.042 --> 12:58.500
How are we gonna do this?

12:58.625 --> 13:00.208
Well, Tony and I are
gonna dive here

13:00.333 --> 13:02.375
and we're gonna go down
and we're gonna set up,

13:02.500 --> 13:03.667
essentially.

13:03.833 --> 13:05.167
We're gonna put
what we call the pounder

13:05.292 --> 13:07.667
-in the middle of our site.
-Yep.

13:07.750 --> 13:09.917
And we'll take
any artifacts we find,

13:10.042 --> 13:11.875
-we're gonna measure off
that pounder.
-All right.

13:13.333 --> 13:17.042
NARRATOR:
The pounder is a tool
created by Barry and Brandon

13:17.167 --> 13:20.375
consisting of a rope
tied to a cinder block.

13:20.500 --> 13:23.875
Its first function
is to act as a safety line

13:24.000 --> 13:27.208
to help the divers navigate
their way to the ocean floor.

13:27.375 --> 13:30.667
It then serves as
a central reference point

13:30.792 --> 13:33.625
to help them mark
the exact locations of artifacts

13:33.708 --> 13:36.250
that they recover
from the <i>Whydah Gally.</i>

13:36.375 --> 13:37.958
We'll be communicating
with the surface

13:38.042 --> 13:39.500
giving them the coordinates
of each artifact

13:39.667 --> 13:41.292
-as we recover them.
-Great.

13:41.417 --> 13:44.375
And we'll just continue to make
as many dives as we can.

13:44.500 --> 13:46.167
Well, I'm pumped.
Let's do it.

13:46.292 --> 13:48.167
MATTY: Yeah, sounds like
we're on a good site. Let's go.

13:48.292 --> 13:49.917
-Sounds good.
-All right,
get you guys geared up.

13:51.792 --> 13:55.167
BARRY:
We're diving in an area
that's very tumultuous.

13:55.292 --> 13:58.708
We're dusting, melting
the sand away very slowly,

13:58.833 --> 14:01.833
and it's a very,
very complicated process,

14:01.958 --> 14:03.583
and that's why
we've been here 40 years.

14:03.708 --> 14:05.458
Okay.

14:07.292 --> 14:09.708
NARRATOR:
Using a specialized
propelling system

14:09.833 --> 14:13.167
known as the deflector,
Barry is able to redirect

14:13.292 --> 14:16.542
the ship's engine wash
downward up to 90 degrees

14:16.708 --> 14:18.792
in order to clear-- or dust--

14:18.875 --> 14:21.375
sand and silt away
from the ocean floor

14:21.500 --> 14:23.417
some 30 feet below.

14:23.542 --> 14:27.125
This process can gently
reveal parts of the wreck

14:27.208 --> 14:29.458
as well as artifacts
and valuables

14:29.542 --> 14:31.750
in the pit that it creates.

14:31.875 --> 14:33.375

underneath it, too.

16:19.583 --> 16:22.542
BRANDON:
While I'm diving, I'm seeing
a lot of cobblestone.

16:23.375 --> 16:26.333
But we're not down
to the artifact layer.

16:28.042 --> 16:33.000
The artifacts rest on
this very fine white sand,

16:33.083 --> 16:36.083
which rests on top of clay.

16:36.208 --> 16:38.000
Above the fine white sand,

16:38.125 --> 16:41.042
we have cobblestone,
glacial till.

16:41.208 --> 16:43.417
And then above that,
you have the shifting sandbar.

16:43.542 --> 16:47.167
So all the artifacts rest
between the cobblestone

16:47.292 --> 16:48.833
and the fine white sand.

16:48.958 --> 16:50.583
If you don't see
the fine white sand,

this concretion.

gunpowder and seawater.

19:01.208 --> 19:02.917
It's really cool,

and we'd probably moved
30 feet to one side,

20:09.708 --> 20:12.292
so getting back the 30 feet
against the current

20:12.375 --> 20:15.333
and getting in that
same spot is not easy.

20:15.500 --> 20:17.833
Hey, we can't get
where I want to get.

20:17.958 --> 20:20.292
This current,
it keeps blowing us this way.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.458
We haven't got much time.

20:28.875 --> 20:32.125
NARRATOR: Just off the coast
of Cape Cod, Massachusetts

20:32.250 --> 20:33.833
Matty Blake and Tony Sampson,
along with

20:33.958 --> 20:37.167
underwater explorers
Barry and Brandon Clifford,

20:37.292 --> 20:39.542
are battling
increasingly rough seas

20:39.708 --> 20:42.208
as they hope to salvage
valuable artifacts

20:42.375 --> 20:43.667
from the <i>Whydah Gally--</i>

20:43.750 --> 20:46.750
a massive pirate ship
that sank in these waters

20:46.875 --> 20:49.500
after being caught
in a devastating storm

20:49.667 --> 20:51.417
back in 1717.

20:51.542 --> 20:53.792
MATTY:
Things are working
against us right now.

20:53.875 --> 20:55.208
Barry looks concerned.

20:55.333 --> 20:57.958
He doesn't like
where the boat is going.

20:58.042 --> 20:59.333
The wind's picking up.

21:00.292 --> 21:02.042
I don't know what's
gonna happen next.

21:02.167 --> 21:05.500
JEFF: Well, unfortunately
the wind's really picking, so...

21:05.625 --> 21:07.708
Mother Nature is not being nice.

21:07.875 --> 21:09.417
We may have to head in.

21:09.542 --> 21:11.708
So we might have
to cancel for today.

21:11.833 --> 21:14.833
Which is a big
disappointment, but, uh...

21:14.958 --> 21:16.500
So you're calling--

21:16.583 --> 21:17.833
You're ceasing
dive operations for now.

21:17.958 --> 21:19.042
-Yeah.
-Okay.

21:19.167 --> 21:21.542
Yeah, I mean,
I'm looking at that flag

21:21.667 --> 21:23.250
and, yeah,

21:23.375 --> 21:24.500
I think you're right--
you can feel it picking up.

21:24.625 --> 21:26.458
JEFF:
The team is eager,

21:26.583 --> 21:29.167
but due to the fact
that there's weather,

21:29.292 --> 21:31.333
things beyond our control,

21:31.458 --> 21:34.083
I had to make
the safety decision.

21:34.208 --> 21:36.375
We can head in
and come back tomorrow.

21:36.500 --> 21:37.833
Okay. Is there
a forecast tomorrow?

21:37.958 --> 21:39.833
Has anyone seen it?

21:39.958 --> 21:41.708
-Yeah. It's more favorable
than today.
-All right, all right.

21:41.833 --> 21:43.500
-So...
-It's more like this morning.

21:43.583 --> 21:45.250
So I'm gonna find
the positive here.

21:45.375 --> 21:48.833
We found the spot.
We got a hit.

21:48.958 --> 21:51.750
We don't know what it is,
possibly an artifact,

21:51.875 --> 21:53.792
and we're just preparing it
for the next day.

21:53.917 --> 21:56.208
And we're gonna find
something incredible tomorrow.

21:56.333 --> 21:58.250
-How about that?
-JEFF: Yeah.
-Sounds good.

21:58.375 --> 22:00.708
-It's all part of the process...
-MATTY: Yeah, yeah.

22:00.875 --> 22:02.583
The weather report
for tomorrow looks good.

22:02.708 --> 22:04.292
So...

22:04.417 --> 22:07.292
this gives Barry more time
to lock in that position

22:07.417 --> 22:09.083
as the weather settles,

22:09.208 --> 22:10.625
dust more,
get to that bottom layer,

22:10.750 --> 22:14.667
and the hope and prayer
is that tomorrow

22:14.750 --> 22:16.833
Tony and Brandon get
to that level

22:16.958 --> 22:20.458
and they see
white sand and gold coins.

22:20.542 --> 22:22.458
-All right.
Well, let's get packed up.
-Yes, sir. Okay.

make their way back
to the <i>Vast Explorer.</i>

22:44.000 --> 22:48.083
There, Barry Clifford
has spent the last several hours

22:48.208 --> 22:49.542
dusting the target area

22:49.708 --> 22:52.708
in preparation for
Brandon and Tony's search

22:52.875 --> 22:55.875

connected to the <i>Whydah Gally.</i>

22:56.000 --> 22:58.458
TONY:
Today the weather
is absolutely phenomenal,

22:58.542 --> 23:01.333
you know,
and we're just excited.

23:01.458 --> 23:03.625
Yesterday we got
blown off the site,

23:03.708 --> 23:05.833
and so the wind
had changed from west,

23:06.000 --> 23:08.208
and we were looking
at south, southwest,

23:08.333 --> 23:09.667
and so the swell had picked up,

23:09.792 --> 23:11.583
but later on in the evening,

23:11.708 --> 23:13.792
the swell had actually
dropped off again

23:13.875 --> 23:16.917
and it was just a gentle swell,
so that had allowed Barry

23:17.042 --> 23:20.792
time enough to blow
or dust this area for us.

23:21.750 --> 23:23.167
TONY:
It looks like
we got a great team.

23:23.250 --> 23:24.958
We got a great day for it today.

23:25.083 --> 23:27.333
I'm super excited about this
hole you've got here, Barry,

23:27.458 --> 23:29.250
and obviously
some artifacts on the bottom.

23:29.375 --> 23:30.667
This is a very good area.

23:30.792 --> 23:32.500
We have to dig down
ten, 20, 30 feet,

23:32.625 --> 23:34.500

23:34.625 --> 23:35.542

everyone ready?
-Let's get to it.

23:35.667 --> 23:37.333
-Let's do it.
-All right.

23:37.458 --> 23:39.500
MATTY:
There's a different
energy today.

23:39.625 --> 23:42.875
It's not a bad feeling,
but it's a feeling of intensity.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.333
We need to get to that
precious layer of sand

23:45.458 --> 23:47.417
where all the treasure falls to.

23:47.542 --> 23:49.125
This is not a recreational dive.

23:49.208 --> 23:50.500
This is a dive that requires

23:50.625 --> 23:53.708
expertise,
a deft hand, and caution.

We were not down
to the artifact layer.

24:39.708 --> 24:41.333
There was no white sand.

24:41.458 --> 24:43.083
So we're gonna have to

24:43.208 --> 24:45.667
kind of keep dusting
the sand away and hopefully

24:45.792 --> 24:48.500
get down to the layer
of artifacts we want to.

24:48.625 --> 24:49.958
What did we see down there?

24:50.083 --> 24:52.792
If you envision
you're at the bottom of

24:52.875 --> 24:54.208
-a sand dune.
-Yep. Yep.

24:54.375 --> 24:55.792
Full of stones on the bottom.

24:55.875 --> 24:57.083
It kind of resembles that.

24:57.208 --> 24:58.625
-Okay.
-Uh...

24:58.750 --> 25:00.667
we're down to 41 feet, so,

25:00.833 --> 25:03.542
you know, if I recall
the cannon pile...

25:03.667 --> 25:05.125
we were at 42 feet.

25:05.208 --> 25:06.708
You know, and that thing was

25:06.875 --> 25:09.333
-still deep in the sand, so....
-BARRY: All right.

25:09.458 --> 25:11.208
-So then we'll blow some more.
-Good.

25:11.333 --> 25:12.625
-Okay.
-MATTY: Perfect.

25:15.458 --> 25:18.833
The obstacles to
treasure hunting are real.

25:18.958 --> 25:21.833
It's hard and you don't
always come up with treasure.

25:21.958 --> 25:23.667
This is the battle
that you fight.

25:23.750 --> 25:25.500

31:28.333 --> 31:30.000
handheld pistols

31:30.167 --> 31:32.500
were originally
single-shot weapons

31:32.625 --> 31:34.250
composed of a metal barrel

31:34.375 --> 31:37.375
and trigger
with a wood frame and handle.

31:37.500 --> 31:40.458
Metal adornments--
or escutcheon plates--

31:40.542 --> 31:43.708
would often be attached
to the sides as decoration.

31:43.833 --> 31:45.375
Is it possible

31:45.542 --> 31:48.375
that this artifact came
from a pistol that belonged

31:48.500 --> 31:51.292
to one of Black Sam Bellamy's
crew members?

31:51.417 --> 31:55.792
Or might it have belonged
to Captain Bellamy himself?

31:55.917 --> 31:58.333
This is extremely important.

31:58.417 --> 31:59.625
Wow.

31:59.750 --> 32:00.667
BARRY:
Extremely important.

32:00.792 --> 32:02.500
A side plate from a pistol

32:02.625 --> 32:04.375
is extremely interesting

32:04.500 --> 32:07.083
and, you know, it needs
to be investigated to help

32:07.208 --> 32:10.458
tell the history of
what was on board the ship.

32:10.542 --> 32:12.833
What's amazing, too,
is in this vast ocean

32:12.958 --> 32:14.917
that you guys find
pieces like that,

32:15.042 --> 32:17.083
and that-- that small
but that important, too.

32:17.208 --> 32:19.417
You don't find
these things every day.

32:19.542 --> 32:21.083
Incredible find, Brandon.

32:23.042 --> 32:25.208
-Yeah.
-MATTY: Ho-Hold on.

32:25.333 --> 32:26.375
Oh, whoa!

32:26.500 --> 32:28.208
-(Tony laughing)
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

32:29.083 --> 32:30.667
Look at that.

32:34.792 --> 32:36.083
Let's go!

32:36.208 --> 32:38.167
NARRATOR:
In Cape Cod, Massachusetts,

32:38.292 --> 32:40.167
after investigating the wreckage

32:40.292 --> 32:41.875
of an 18th century pirate wreck
known as the <i>Whydah Gally,</i>

32:42.042 --> 32:44.708
divers Brandon Clifford
and Tony Sampson

32:44.875 --> 32:47.167
are sharing their
historic discoveries

32:47.250 --> 32:49.417
with Barry Clifford,
Matty Blake,

32:49.542 --> 32:51.042
and the rest of the team.

32:51.167 --> 32:53.417
Now, that has got
some weight to it as well.

32:53.542 --> 32:56.333
That's a... it's
a Mexican eight real.

32:56.417 --> 32:57.708
-So it's...
-MATTY: Eight real?

32:57.875 --> 32:59.750
It's one ounce.
It's from Mexico.

32:59.875 --> 33:02.667
MATTY:
This is honest-to-goodness
pirate treasure.

33:02.750 --> 33:05.333
And it's a real sign of
what's to come in this area.

33:05.458 --> 33:08.333
It validates Barry's belief
that this is a hot area

33:08.500 --> 33:11.667
'cause in just that short
last dive they pulled out two

33:11.833 --> 33:13.500
incredible artifacts.

33:13.667 --> 33:16.000
BARRY:
There's no degradation
on this at all, okay?

33:16.125 --> 33:18.083
-That means this is...
-(whoops)

33:18.208 --> 33:21.083
This is the first time that this
has been exposed down there.

33:21.208 --> 33:23.542
Which is a really good clue
to what else could be there.

33:23.667 --> 33:25.000
That's a good haul.

33:25.125 --> 33:26.292
Coins that we've already dug on

33:26.375 --> 33:28.125
and then dig on them twice,

33:28.208 --> 33:30.333
they'll be concreted because
the oxygen gets to them.

33:30.417 --> 33:34.125
This has been undisturbed
for 300 years.

33:34.208 --> 33:36.333
That's a really good clue
as to where we are.

33:36.500 --> 33:39.708
When I find an artifact
such as a coin,

33:39.833 --> 33:41.208
it puts the history in your hand

33:41.375 --> 33:43.292
and you're able to connect
the dots of the story.

33:43.375 --> 33:45.042
Phenomenal, buddy.
Well done.

33:45.167 --> 33:47.375
This is what
these pirates were after.

33:47.542 --> 33:49.375
These pirates were looking
to take their destinies

33:49.500 --> 33:52.958
into their own hands
and go and get their piece.

33:53.042 --> 33:55.000
It was a valuable
piece of money for them.

33:55.083 --> 33:56.833
This is incredible.

33:56.917 --> 33:59.167
This is an incredible day,
and what I love most about it

33:59.333 --> 34:00.667
is that it wasn't easy.

34:00.792 --> 34:01.875
This is incredible right here.

34:02.042 --> 34:03.375
I love that you're happy.

34:03.500 --> 34:05.542
There's an urgency
to tell this story,

34:05.667 --> 34:08.792
there's an urgency for people
to understand the significance

34:08.917 --> 34:10.375
of what the <i>Whydah</i> represents.

34:10.500 --> 34:12.750
This is a pirate ship
working as a democracy,

34:12.875 --> 34:14.667
and more people need to know it,

34:14.750 --> 34:16.333
and Barry and Brandon
are bringing it to life

34:16.417 --> 34:17.917
to this area and to the world.

34:18.042 --> 34:19.750
And I'm so proud
to be from here,

34:19.875 --> 34:22.500
I'm happy for them, and I'm
proud to be a small part of it.

34:22.625 --> 34:24.250
It was an awesome day.

34:24.375 --> 34:27.750
This has been an honor to
watch you guys do what you do.

34:27.875 --> 34:31.083
You're not the first family
that we've been with

34:31.208 --> 34:33.083
that have tried
something like this,

34:33.208 --> 34:34.708
but you're certainly
one of the best.

34:34.875 --> 34:37.542
And what you guys have
accomplished is incredible.

34:37.708 --> 34:40.083
I know that this is, this is,
like, super exciting for us,

34:40.208 --> 34:41.667
but I also know it's just
a scratch of the surface

34:41.792 --> 34:43.583
of what you're going to do here.

34:43.708 --> 34:46.000
BRANDON:
We have, like, a deep
reverence for this history

34:46.167 --> 34:47.958
and a deep reverence
for these artifacts

34:48.042 --> 34:49.333
and the history of the <i>Whydah.</i>

34:49.458 --> 34:51.875
To be able to touch it
and share it

34:52.000 --> 34:55.333
and be a part of the story
is a powerful thing for us.

34:55.417 --> 34:57.458
On behalf of
Rick and Marty and Tony,

34:57.542 --> 35:00.167
I just want to thank you guys
for allowing us to see just

35:00.292 --> 35:02.333
a little bit of what you do.

35:02.458 --> 35:03.792
So thank you,
thank you, thank you.

35:03.917 --> 35:05.583
Our pleasure.

35:05.708 --> 35:07.875
BARRY:
You know, we have
a big job ahead of us.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.458
It's about preserving
this incredibly

35:10.583 --> 35:13.167
important time capsule
for posterity,

35:13.292 --> 35:15.042
and it's gonna take,

35:15.167 --> 35:16.958
it's gonna take
another lifetime to do that.

35:17.042 --> 35:18.667
And how do we sign this off?

35:18.750 --> 35:20.708
What's a good, like,
way to sign this off?

35:20.833 --> 35:24.958
Here's to us. Who's like us?
Damn few and the rest are dead.

35:25.083 --> 35:26.458
(laughing)

35:26.583 --> 35:29.250
MATTY:
I love it! Congratulations.

35:30.792 --> 35:33.542
♪ ♪

35:36.375 --> 35:39.292
Well, Tony...
It was quite a trip home.

35:39.375 --> 35:40.792
-I'll tell you that.
-Unbelievable.

35:40.875 --> 35:42.208
To watch that team operate,

35:42.333 --> 35:43.792
it was like what we did
the first time

35:43.875 --> 35:44.833
but kind of like

35:44.958 --> 35:45.792
next level, right?

35:45.917 --> 35:47.000
Yeah.

35:47.083 --> 35:48.458
Did it meet your expectations?

35:48.542 --> 35:50.208
'Cause your expectations
were really high.

35:50.375 --> 35:53.333
The thing for me is,
I would go back in a heartbeat.

35:53.458 --> 35:55.958
I'm hooked on this
yellow brick road, you know?

35:56.042 --> 35:58.042
But we got some
really cool finds.

35:58.167 --> 36:00.708
MATTY:
I mean, you guys made two finds

36:00.875 --> 36:02.125
that were stunning.

36:02.208 --> 36:03.750
And in fact,

36:03.875 --> 36:07.542
one of the finds,
Barry seemed more excited about

36:07.667 --> 36:10.333
than if it was
a piece of treasure.

36:10.417 --> 36:12.250
He thinks this particular find--

36:12.375 --> 36:13.958
which we're gonna talk
about in a second with them

36:14.042 --> 36:16.667
'cause they're standing by--
he thinks it was so incredible

36:16.750 --> 36:19.167
that it could tie into
a part of the mystery

36:19.292 --> 36:20.583
that we haven't really

36:20.708 --> 36:22.708
-known about yet.
-Let's hear about it.

36:22.833 --> 36:24.167
-Let's hear about it.
-Yeah, they're
standing by with, uh...

36:24.292 --> 36:25.667
to tell you guys about it.

36:27.125 --> 36:28.167
-Hello, guys.
-Hey, guys.

36:28.250 --> 36:29.167
-Hey.
-Hi, guys.

36:29.333 --> 36:30.583
<i>Thank you for having us.</i>

36:30.708 --> 36:32.292
MARTY:
Welcome back to the war room.

36:32.375 --> 36:34.208
We're eager to hear
your side of the story,

36:34.333 --> 36:35.833
we just heard
from these two guys.

36:35.958 --> 36:38.333
MATTY:
Well, it was quite
an adventure, you know,

36:38.417 --> 36:40.333
we were just
telling the guys here about

36:40.458 --> 36:42.500
all the drama and excitement

36:42.625 --> 36:44.833
of trying to get
the boat on the spot,

36:45.000 --> 36:47.500
finally culminating in
those two incredible finds.

36:47.583 --> 36:49.333
Which Rick and Marty
have not seen,

36:49.417 --> 36:52.125
so you guys take the floor.

36:52.208 --> 36:53.708
Yeah, so, um...

36:53.875 --> 36:57.333
we were able to find
a couple artifacts down there.

36:57.458 --> 36:59.458
<i>We found a Spanish
silver piece of eight.</i>

36:59.583 --> 37:00.875
Wow.

37:01.000 --> 37:03.833
A Spanish silver eight real

37:03.958 --> 37:04.917
<i>minted in Mexico.</i>

37:05.042 --> 37:06.875
What says "minted in Mexico,"

37:07.042 --> 37:08.542
-if I can ask?
-Yeah, I was just gonna ask
the same thing.

37:08.667 --> 37:10.792
<i>Now, they're usually
pretty crudely cut,</i>

37:10.917 --> 37:12.667
<i>and you can tell</i>

37:12.792 --> 37:15.375
<i>there's a different
series of markings on this coin</i>

37:15.500 --> 37:17.500
than the last coin we found.

37:17.625 --> 37:19.000
Ah, so cool.

37:19.125 --> 37:20.333
-TONY: Beautiful.
-MATTY: And then, Barry,

37:20.417 --> 37:21.958
there was a second find

37:22.042 --> 37:25.208
that you in particular were
really excited about.

37:25.375 --> 37:26.208
<i>BARRY:
Yeah, I can't wait</i>

37:26.375 --> 37:27.500
to show you guys

37:27.583 --> 37:29.083
<i>the historical significance</i>

37:29.208 --> 37:30.375
<i>of what we discovered.</i>

37:31.958 --> 37:34.625
<i>This is extremely,
extremely important,</i>

37:34.708 --> 37:36.000
<i>this artifact.</i>

37:36.875 --> 37:39.667
-MARTY: Isn't that something.
-RICK: Wow.

37:43.333 --> 37:44.917
And I believe that
that's a Jacobite flower.

37:46.167 --> 37:48.500
<i>We know there were
a lot of Scots</i>

37:48.583 --> 37:50.542
<i>on board the</i> Whydah,

37:50.667 --> 37:52.625
<i>many of whom were probably</i>

37:52.708 --> 37:56.042
getting out of town because
of the Jacobite rebellion.

37:56.208 --> 38:00.333
<i>And don't forget the Jacobite
rebellion started in 1715.</i>

38:00.458 --> 38:04.375
The <i>Whydah</i> wrecked
in the beginning of 1717.

38:04.500 --> 38:07.333
<i>So the Jacobite rebellion was</i>

38:07.500 --> 38:10.292
in full swing
when the <i>Whydah</i> wrecked.

38:11.500 --> 38:13.458
NARRATOR:
In 1715,

38:13.542 --> 38:16.667
the exiled Scottish King
James Edward Stuart

38:16.792 --> 38:18.875
and his followers,
known as Jacobites,

38:19.042 --> 38:22.667
launched an uprising
in an attempt to recapture

38:22.750 --> 38:25.792
the thrones of England,
Scotland and Ireland.

38:26.875 --> 38:30.417
The rebellion failed,
leading to many Jacobites

38:30.542 --> 38:33.667
being executed
by the English Crown.

38:34.625 --> 38:37.417
Is it possible that
one of the crew members

38:37.542 --> 38:39.417
who perished with
Black Sam Bellamy

38:39.542 --> 38:43.500
aboard the <i>Whydah</i> was a Jacobite
who turned to piracy

38:43.667 --> 38:46.625
in order to escape
persecution in Europe?

38:46.750 --> 38:49.292
<i>BARRY:
There's no question about it.</i>

38:49.417 --> 38:51.125
<i>That's a Jacobite rose.</i>

38:51.208 --> 38:52.792
-Wow.
-That's amazing.

38:52.875 --> 38:53.917
Yeah.

38:54.042 --> 38:56.042
Well, the finds were incredible.

38:56.208 --> 38:58.208
What's the plan moving forward?

38:58.333 --> 39:00.875
<i>Well, the plan is
to get back out there.</i>

39:01.042 --> 39:03.708
We're not sure where the rest
of the <i>Whydah</i> really remains.

39:03.833 --> 39:06.583
<i>Everybody has
a different theory,</i>

39:06.708 --> 39:08.250
<i>a little bit
different perspective,</i>

39:08.375 --> 39:11.208
<i>but we're certainly
going to give it our best</i>

39:11.333 --> 39:13.083
and we'll be out there soon.

39:13.208 --> 39:14.458
Hey, if you had to guess

39:14.542 --> 39:16.667
what percent of that
has been salvaged,

39:16.833 --> 39:19.542
what would you say?
Or what percent is left?

39:19.667 --> 39:23.125
<i>There's probably a million coins
on board the</i> Whydah.

39:23.250 --> 39:26.542
<i>So we brought up
only a tiny fraction</i>

39:26.667 --> 39:28.500
<i>of what was recorded</i>

39:28.667 --> 39:30.500
to have been on the ship.

39:30.667 --> 39:32.208
Wow.

39:32.333 --> 39:35.000
So, Brandon, keep that, uh...
keep those fins and masks ready

39:35.125 --> 39:36.667
'cause you've got a lot
more diving to do. (laughs)

39:36.792 --> 39:38.000
If there's
that many coins still.

39:38.125 --> 39:39.083
<i>BRANDON:
Yeah,</i>

39:39.208 --> 39:41.708
there's a lot of diving.
(laughs)

39:41.875 --> 39:43.833
I just want to say hats off
to both of you

39:43.917 --> 39:45.167
for your commitment.

39:45.292 --> 39:46.542
MARTY:
And hats off to both of you

39:46.667 --> 39:48.167
-for letting us participate.
-RICK: Yep.

39:48.292 --> 39:50.042
Thank you so much
for the opportunity

39:50.167 --> 39:51.333
to dive with you guys.

39:51.458 --> 39:53.458
It was an honor.
It really was.

39:53.583 --> 39:55.167
Hats off to you guys
for your commitment,

39:55.250 --> 39:56.833
and it was our pleasure
to have you.

39:57.000 --> 39:59.583
Right, and if Rick
and I come to take a look

39:59.708 --> 40:02.167
at your museum, we'd be--
it'd be okay, right?

40:02.292 --> 40:04.000
(chuckling):
Oh, yeah. Of course.

40:04.125 --> 40:05.250
We'd love to have you.

40:05.375 --> 40:07.083
-All right.
-It's on the list.

40:07.208 --> 40:08.583
It'll only be $7.50.

40:08.708 --> 40:10.250
We're gonna give you
a heck of a discount.

40:10.375 --> 40:12.042
-(all laughing)
-MARTY: All right. Good.

40:12.167 --> 40:13.583
MATTY:
Well, thanks again, guys.

40:13.708 --> 40:16.167
We will certainly stay in touch,
and any developments,

40:16.292 --> 40:17.750
if you make a find
any time soon,

40:17.875 --> 40:19.417
please call us immediately,
we'll be all over it.

40:19.542 --> 40:21.750
<i>All right, guys.
Thank you so much.</i>

40:21.875 --> 40:22.833
-Thanks to you.
-Thanks for sharing
your adventure.

40:23.000 --> 40:24.125
Thanks, Brandon.

40:24.208 --> 40:24.917
MARTY:
Take care. Stay safe.

40:25.042 --> 40:26.417
Take care.

40:26.542 --> 40:28.208
-Bye-bye.
-That's just a great story.

40:28.333 --> 40:30.458
-RICK: Yeah, yeah, it is.
-MARTY: And you know
what comes to my mind

40:30.542 --> 40:33.500
is-is the term "the real deal."

40:33.625 --> 40:34.875
You hear that a lot,

40:35.042 --> 40:36.333
but everything about this
is the real deal.

40:36.458 --> 40:37.500
The treasure hunt's
the real deal.

40:37.583 --> 40:39.542
The story's the real deal,

40:39.667 --> 40:40.958
those gentlemen
are the real deal.

40:41.042 --> 40:42.500
You know? Committed
to what they started.

40:42.625 --> 40:43.875
Uh, it's-it's just,

40:44.042 --> 40:47.500
it's just an honor to be
a small part of it.

40:47.625 --> 40:49.667
I mean, there is
more treasure down there.

40:49.833 --> 40:52.583
-So he...
-I mean, I don't think
there's any doubt.

40:52.708 --> 40:54.375
I mean, there's nobody
in the world that knows

40:54.500 --> 40:56.042
-more about it than those two.
-That's right.

40:56.167 --> 40:58.208
And they just said, "A small
percentage has been found."

40:58.375 --> 41:01.042
That leaves a large percentage.
(chuckles)

41:01.208 --> 41:02.625
RICK:
And at this point

41:02.708 --> 41:03.875
it's not just
about the <i>Whydah,</i> right?

41:04.042 --> 41:05.208
It's the story.

41:05.333 --> 41:07.250
The ever-revolving
stories that come

41:07.375 --> 41:09.833
from the pursuit
of the <i>Whydah,</i> right?

41:09.958 --> 41:12.667
That's what's really fascinating
to me, and the ability,

41:12.750 --> 41:14.708
as Brandon said,
to tell the story.

41:14.875 --> 41:17.250
Well, it fires me up to finish
our little quest off.

41:17.375 --> 41:18.583
-Let's go.
-Little?

41:18.708 --> 41:20.333
-(all laughing)
-And it fires me up

41:20.458 --> 41:21.917
to finish our big quest off.

41:22.042 --> 41:23.417
RICK:
Let's go.

41:23.542 --> 41:24.875
MARTY: Let's get back after it.
Let's go.

41:26.083 --> 41:27.500
<i>Sempre avanti!</i>
