00:02.037 --> 00:06.277
(seductive music)

00:08.356 --> 00:10.476
(grunting)
(moaning)

00:14.155 --> 00:16.275
(grunting)
(moaning)

00:23.033 --> 00:25.233
(seductive music)

00:29.152 --> 00:32.752
(violin music)

00:34.951 --> 00:36.211
- Hey, should we order some

00:36.311 --> 00:38.331
room service and charge
it to his room?

00:38.431 --> 00:39.850
- Oh, cheeky,
I like it.

00:39.950 --> 00:42.490
- I might order a chicken
korma, some fragrant rice.

00:42.590 --> 00:44.529
I'm might well join you,
shovel a couple of bhajis.

00:44.629 --> 00:47.249
We're two hours ahead of schedule
we should treat ourselves.

00:47.349 --> 00:49.688
- Thanks for agreeing to do
this job early, mate.

00:49.788 --> 00:52.648
Kat's got a sofa delivery
I've got to be home for.

00:52.748 --> 00:56.327
- You're telling me we shifted
this job because of Kat's sofa?

00:56.427 --> 00:58.907
- She's been waiting
six months for it, mate.

00:59.467 --> 01:01.366
And there is a little sofa

01:01.466 --> 01:03.526
emoji hurdling its
way down one six.

01:03.626 --> 01:05.646
- It's the end of days is a
sofa with its own app.

01:05.746 --> 01:07.245
- Well it did cost
her 16 grand.

01:07.345 --> 01:11.784
- 16 grand? What's it stuffed
with, 15 grand?

01:12.464 --> 01:15.324
(grunting)
- Oh god.

01:15.424 --> 01:17.423
(phone beeping)

01:19.023 --> 01:20.523
- Mr. V?

01:20.623 --> 01:23.602
We've got ourselves another job.
And guess where this one is?

01:23.702 --> 01:25.122
Drum roll, please.

01:25.222 --> 01:27.462
(mimics drumroll)
Nice... Japan!

01:27.861 --> 01:29.161
- Japan? Blimey.

01:29.261 --> 01:33.040
- I'm about to show you the salary.
- Oh wow!

01:33.140 --> 01:35.380
But Japan's quite
far away, is it?

01:35.740 --> 01:38.939
- Yeah, but you know what?
We are going places, mate.

01:40.419 --> 01:42.539
Let's grab the cash
and head off.

01:43.219 --> 01:44.158
- Okay, there we go.

01:44.258 --> 01:46.438
Let's put him under here.

01:46.538 --> 01:48.538
(ringing)

01:49.777 --> 01:51.777
- Must be his phone.

01:54.377 --> 01:56.516
- Okay, he's got a message
from Rusnak Ivanov.

01:56.616 --> 01:59.196
"Got held up,  there
in a couple of hours.

01:59.296 --> 02:01.635
Looking forward
to finally meeting you."

02:01.735 --> 02:03.355
Should I just text back
and say, don't bother?

02:03.455 --> 02:05.514
There's no point sitting in
traffic if your friend's dead.

02:05.614 --> 02:07.874
- We were supposed to do
the hit after the drug deal.

02:07.974 --> 02:10.394
We're supposed to walk out of
here with cash instead of drugs

02:10.494 --> 02:12.113
we've come too early. What
the shit are we gonna do?

02:12.213 --> 02:13.553
- Couldn't we just do
the deal ourselves?

02:13.653 --> 02:15.313
I mean, clearly
they've never met.

02:15.413 --> 02:16.712
They're not going to know
what he looks like.

02:16.812 --> 02:18.232
- I don't think the
Moldovan mafia

02:18.332 --> 02:21.491
thinks he looks like a pair
of middle aged women.

02:22.331 --> 02:25.391
This is because of your
obsession
with Kat's overpriced sofa.

02:25.491 --> 02:26.711
- Fran, I've had
an idea that is

02:26.811 --> 02:30.070
so downright crazy,
it just might work.

02:30.170 --> 02:31.430
- I don't suppose you've got

02:31.530 --> 02:33.709
an idea that downright
sensible and well thought out,

02:33.809 --> 02:36.209
it absolutely,
definitely will work.

02:36.929 --> 02:38.508
Eh, we start with crazy.

02:38.608 --> 02:41.868
(quirky music)
(grunting)

02:41.968 --> 02:43.967
(knocking)
- That'll be him.

02:47.047 --> 02:50.406
(quirky music)

02:55.325 --> 02:57.025
- You're
the actor, right?

02:57.125 --> 02:59.065
Guilty.
Kiren Roberts.

02:59.165 --> 03:01.384
Magnetic Talent.
At your service.

03:01.484 --> 03:02.504
(door closes)

03:02.604 --> 03:05.183
- It says it's a
mini cab card?

03:05.283 --> 03:07.183
- Oh, other side. Saves
on printing cost.

03:07.283 --> 03:08.223
- Oh, great.

03:08.323 --> 03:10.502
- Hi.
- Hi, good to see you.

03:10.602 --> 03:11.662
Thanks for coming
so quickly.

03:11.762 --> 03:14.622
Now I'm not sure
what your agent's told you.

03:14.722 --> 03:16.821
- Not very much.
She's pretty snowed under.

03:16.921 --> 03:18.981
It's a very busy time
of year for animal talent.

03:19.081 --> 03:20.381
And that's a lot
of her client list, so.

03:20.481 --> 03:22.820
- She represents
animal talent, like who?

03:22.920 --> 03:25.180
- Ever heard of a
little movie called Babe?

03:25.280 --> 03:27.579
- Whoa, she
represents that pig?

03:27.679 --> 03:29.979
- The pig's grandson, they're
an acting dynasty.

03:30.079 --> 03:34.338
- This is great. Little pressed
for time. So, long short of it

03:34.438 --> 03:37.537
I run
a company with my assistant

03:37.637 --> 03:40.457
here, which specializes in
immersive events or parties.

03:40.557 --> 03:43.376
- Zombie apocalypse, medieval
banquet, prison escape.

03:43.476 --> 03:45.096
I mean, that stuff's
my bread and butter.

03:45.196 --> 03:46.576
So, you've come
to the right guy.

03:46.676 --> 03:49.095
That is great to hear.
We've got a big

03:49.195 --> 03:52.495
stag party arriving
and the lead actor's had

03:52.595 --> 03:54.974
to drop recently.
- So unprofessional.

03:55.074 --> 03:56.894
- So why don't we
get your costume?

03:56.994 --> 03:58.813
And I can explain
the scenario.

03:58.913 --> 04:00.913
- Okay, cool.

04:01.913 --> 04:05.512
(upbeat music)

04:06.472 --> 04:08.472
- Sorry.

04:11.351 --> 04:13.471
Will that work for you?

04:15.950 --> 04:20.369
So, I'm Jackson Reynard.
Big shot movie producer

04:20.469 --> 04:23.329
who also moonlights as
a high rolling drug dealer.

04:23.429 --> 04:27.008
- Exactly.
- And some Moldovan gangsters

04:27.108 --> 04:28.928
are on their way
over to do a deal.

04:29.028 --> 04:32.367
All I've got to do is give
this big bag of drugs to their

04:32.467 --> 04:34.527
boss, who's being
played by the stag.

04:34.627 --> 04:36.846
- You got it.
- And also I'm fighting a secret

04:36.946 --> 04:39.366
lifelong battle with obsessive
compulsive disorder.

04:39.466 --> 04:40.686
- No, where did
that come from?

04:40.786 --> 04:41.925
- That's my own flourish.

04:42.025 --> 04:43.205
That's what the
best actors do.

04:43.305 --> 04:44.885
- You can't just add
in random stuff.

04:44.985 --> 04:47.044
This is the first time you've
met these guys and they are

04:47.144 --> 04:51.564
incredibly dangerous in this
entirely imaginary scenario.

04:51.664 --> 04:53.723
- No, I get it but trust me, you
want to keep these things cheeky

04:53.823 --> 04:55.883
I mean, this is
a stag do, right?

04:55.983 --> 04:57.523
- Sure
but trust me.

04:57.623 --> 05:00.642
Want to keep things really,
really simple, you know?

05:00.742 --> 05:02.842
So you just stick
to the script.

05:02.942 --> 05:04.361
Stay in character, right?

05:04.461 --> 05:08.600
I am going to be playing the
muscle and my lovely assistant

05:08.700 --> 05:11.480
here is going to be doing...
catering.

05:11.580 --> 05:14.239
- Oh, can I grab a croissant?
Just the egg mcmuffin I had

05:14.339 --> 05:16.339
on the way over,
has hardly touched the sides.

05:17.379 --> 05:18.279
- Listen, I'll be
with you every

05:18.379 --> 05:19.319
step of the way,
so don't worry.

05:19.419 --> 05:20.678
- Listen, darling,

05:20.778 --> 05:23.438
I played Henry VIII at Hampton
Court for three years.

05:23.538 --> 05:24.917
Didn't break character once.

05:25.017 --> 05:26.277
Even when I got the news,

05:26.377 --> 05:28.277
my then wife had
been in a car crash.

05:28.377 --> 05:31.136
If anything is just fed
into the performance.

05:32.856 --> 05:34.856
- Could I have a word?

05:36.575 --> 05:38.555
- Oh, wow.
Cool props.

05:38.655 --> 05:41.674
- Okay, how come I get
to do the boring bit?

05:41.774 --> 05:44.034
I hide the body?
This whole thing was my idea,

05:44.134 --> 05:45.954
so I should be
playing the muscle.

05:46.054 --> 05:49.333
- I think it's obvious who is more
convincing as muscle.

05:51.413 --> 05:52.632
Why are you pointing your

05:52.732 --> 05:54.272
boobs at me in that really
weird aggressive manner?

05:54.372 --> 05:56.392
- I'm aiming my
power stance at you.

05:56.492 --> 05:59.071
- Oh, you're power stance.
- According to Kat,

05:59.171 --> 06:01.191
a well placed,
power stance in the workplace

06:01.291 --> 06:03.070
can lead to less
verbal confrontation.

06:03.170 --> 06:04.590
She says I should be more

06:04.690 --> 06:07.870
assertive so that I don't get
walked over by certain people.

06:07.970 --> 06:09.389
- Oh, really?
Really?

06:09.489 --> 06:11.869
Well, how about I
aim my power stance at you!

06:11.969 --> 06:15.468
With some added
verbals. You have potentially

06:15.568 --> 06:18.328
fucked our entire career
over Kat's overpriced sofa.

06:18.768 --> 06:21.727
- Is it a hard no
on the OCD backstory?

06:23.687 --> 06:27.646
(upbeat music)

06:30.685 --> 06:35.124
(upbeat music)

06:38.884 --> 06:43.203
(upbeat music)

06:48.082 --> 06:49.622
- Oh, god.
Okay, here we go.

06:49.722 --> 06:51.721
You ready?

06:54.121 --> 06:56.121
- Showtime.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.100
What's my characters name?

07:00.200 --> 07:02.259
- Jackson Raynard.
- Jackson Raynard.

07:02.359 --> 07:04.359
Jackson Raynard.
Jackson Raynard.

07:05.439 --> 07:07.718
Gentlemen.
Welcome.

07:10.198 --> 07:15.197
(upbeat music)

07:15.517 --> 07:17.177
- I need that trolley off ya.

07:17.277 --> 07:21.496
No, no, no, no, no.

07:21.596 --> 07:26.395
Sophie, this trolley
is for a VIP.

07:27.315 --> 07:29.294
Let's just say,
you wouldn't... "beliebe"...

07:29.394 --> 07:33.714
- Stop.
- ...if I were to tell you.

07:35.273 --> 07:38.233
Actually in real life,
very much smaller.

07:39.273 --> 07:40.772
- No way!
You can keep that.

07:40.872 --> 07:42.872
- Thank you.

07:44.192 --> 07:47.111
(upbeat music)

07:47.671 --> 07:50.231
- Oh shit, only an hour and a
half to go.

07:51.990 --> 07:57.229
(upbeat music)

07:58.229 --> 08:00.349
- Oh shitty pants.

08:01.029 --> 08:02.848
Oh Jackson.

08:02.948 --> 08:04.948
Jackson.

08:05.348 --> 08:11.827
(upbeat music)

08:23.584 --> 08:26.904
- There. I like to have
everything just so.

08:27.224 --> 08:29.243
It's a condition.

08:29.343 --> 08:33.523
- So, Jackson. Nice to finally
put a face to the name.

08:33.623 --> 08:37.282
How's the movie business?
- Stretch limos, premieres up

08:37.382 --> 08:39.681
to my neck in bullshit
lawsuits, same shit,

08:39.781 --> 08:44.960
different decade. How's the
Moldovan Mafia business?

08:45.060 --> 08:47.360
- Work, work,
work. Always busy.

08:47.460 --> 08:50.239
Sometimes, I think I should
make a career change. When I

08:50.339 --> 08:53.159
was a little boy, all I ever
wanted to do was be an actor.

08:53.259 --> 08:55.079
Can you believe that?

08:55.179 --> 08:57.078
Maybe there is
a role for me in

08:57.178 --> 08:59.178
one of your films, huh?

09:00.138 --> 09:02.457
- No, you're far too ugly.

09:03.977 --> 09:06.096
I mean, who'd married
that? Am I right?

09:09.256 --> 09:11.116
(laughter)

09:11.216 --> 09:12.955
- Too ugly?

09:13.055 --> 09:15.615
You're a funny guy, Jackson.

09:16.095 --> 09:20.334
(rock music)

09:22.213 --> 09:27.133
(rock music)

09:27.732 --> 09:28.952
- Dema.

09:29.052 --> 09:30.152
Dema.

09:30.252 --> 09:31.312
Play nice.

09:31.412 --> 09:34.071
My cousin Dema, he's a little,
(whistles)

09:34.171 --> 09:37.951
but he's my best man.
- Ah, the best man.

09:38.051 --> 09:39.510
Nice.
- If anybody ever tries to

09:39.610 --> 09:41.790
fuck me over, I just
pulls their head off.

09:41.890 --> 09:43.110
Quite literally.

09:43.210 --> 09:46.909
- Well, you better watch out
because Meredith here,

09:47.009 --> 09:48.349
she's an animal too.

09:48.449 --> 09:51.848
Born and bread on the mean
streets of Johannesburg.

09:56.807 --> 09:58.187
- Yeah, I mean,

09:58.287 --> 10:02.286
I can punch through a brick
wall like it's a wet hob knob, yah?

10:03.286 --> 10:05.425
- Meredith.
Drinks all around.

10:05.525 --> 10:07.525
- Where from?

10:07.925 --> 10:13.724
- Where from, boss?
And the mini bar, obviously.

10:17.763 --> 10:19.763
- Sorry about that.
- Women, huh?

10:20.843 --> 10:21.902
(phone rings)

10:22.002 --> 10:24.582
- What's the best Moldovan
movie, ever made?

10:24.682 --> 10:25.422
(phone rings)

10:25.522 --> 10:26.622
(thick accent, indistinct)

10:26.722 --> 10:28.661
Fran, why are you
speaking in Welsh accent?

10:28.761 --> 10:31.701
- Look, it's a very long
and quite annoying story.

10:31.801 --> 10:33.060
- A couple of things,

10:33.160 --> 10:36.340
firstly, the sofa is 88
minutes and 6 seconds away.

10:36.440 --> 10:38.619
Yeah, I don't really have
time for that right now.

10:38.719 --> 10:41.939
- Okay, secondly,
Jackson may not be

10:42.039 --> 10:43.378
as dead as we thought he was.

10:43.478 --> 10:44.578
- What?

10:44.678 --> 10:46.818
- Yeah, and I might have
lost him a little bit.

10:46.918 --> 10:48.617
- Why didn't you start
with that?

10:48.717 --> 10:50.097
- Okay, just a thought.

10:50.197 --> 10:52.777
It might be a good
idea to seal the

10:52.877 --> 10:57.056
deal ASAP in case Jackson is
heading back to the room.

10:57.156 --> 10:59.276
- Yeah, well you cannot
allow that to happen.

11:00.155 --> 11:03.875
(upbeat piano music)

11:05.314 --> 11:09.794
(upbeat music)

11:10.433 --> 11:14.833
- The game's up mate.
Wait, wait!

11:21.711 --> 11:24.811
- Keanu is like goddamn
Dyson vacuum cleaner.

11:24.911 --> 11:26.650
And I'm like, "dude,
you gotta slow down

11:26.750 --> 11:29.810
or you're going to inhale the
whole fucking toilet seat!"

11:29.910 --> 11:31.769
(laughter)

11:31.869 --> 11:35.289
- Boss, I think it's probably
time to wrap this deal up?

11:35.389 --> 11:39.008
- Gentlemen, I'm reminded that
we're here to do business.

11:39.108 --> 11:42.527
- If little miss bodyguard says so.
Who's in charge here my friend?

11:42.627 --> 11:43.847
- I know.
Next thing you know,

11:43.947 --> 11:45.927
she'll be dressing me up
in a butler's outfit,

11:46.027 --> 11:49.126
calling me Jeeves and
getting me to wipe her ass.

11:49.226 --> 11:51.486
(laughs)
- This guy.

11:51.586 --> 11:53.625
- I love it.
- He loves it.

11:56.705 --> 11:57.445
It's been fun Jackson.

11:57.545 --> 11:58.844
- Almost seems a shame

11:58.944 --> 12:00.484
to be wrapping
things up so early.

12:00.584 --> 12:03.404
Always good to leave
people wanting more, huh?

12:03.504 --> 12:07.663
(dramatic rock music)

12:08.663 --> 12:10.882
- You know, what?
You're right.

12:10.982 --> 12:13.762
I mean, the night is still
young. We have a suite here

12:13.862 --> 12:15.681
at the hotel for a
private celebration.

12:15.781 --> 12:16.921
Why not come with us?

12:17.021 --> 12:19.601
We can smoke some cigars,
play some crabs,

12:19.701 --> 12:23.780
talk to some girls and we
can do the deal there?

12:26.779 --> 12:31.278
- Let's keep this party going!
- Boss, we have a call with

12:31.378 --> 12:32.638
Pacino.
- Cancel it.

12:32.738 --> 12:35.198
Who needs Pacino when he got
the real deal right here.

12:35.298 --> 12:37.297

Everything, highest level.

13:13.771 --> 13:16.990

Meredith.

13:20.649 --> 13:21.669
- I'm not so sure.

13:21.769 --> 13:23.549
Actually, this is
a very big deal.

13:23.649 --> 13:25.468
There's some real
bad guys out there.

13:25.568 --> 13:27.788
- But there's some real
bad guys here as well.

13:32.287 --> 13:34.287

14:08.920 --> 14:09.900

14:10.000 --> 14:12.620
- You need to stick
to the script.

14:12.720 --> 14:14.219
This isn't part of
the package.

14:14.319 --> 14:15.819
We shouldn't be in here.

14:15.919 --> 14:18.379
How can I explain
this to amateur?

14:18.479 --> 14:23.218
As an actor,
one has to listen to one's gut

14:23.318 --> 14:25.737
and my gut's telling me
that my character would say

14:25.837 --> 14:28.297
yes, the gambling and girls.
- Just do the deal.

14:28.397 --> 14:29.457
Get it done.
Go on.

14:29.557 --> 14:31.556
- I'll get it.

14:34.596 --> 14:36.595
Make me lucky.

14:38.355 --> 14:40.355
Woohoo!

14:40.674 --> 14:42.674
- The gentleman wins again.

(upbeat music)

14:57.271 --> 14:59.271
(background chatter)

15:03.350 --> 15:06.090
- Just the man
I was looking for.

15:06.190 --> 15:09.789
This paper was left unattended
which was very careless of you.

15:10.229 --> 15:11.689
You enjoying the party?

15:11.789 --> 15:16.948
Lots of nice ladies here.
Voluntarily I presume.

15:20.507 --> 15:22.627
Great chat.

15:23.427 --> 15:25.566
(grunting)

15:25.666 --> 15:27.486
- None of this was worth it.

15:27.586 --> 15:29.825
What do you mean?
The drugs.

15:30.665 --> 15:32.665
They're fake.

15:34.504 --> 15:36.084
- Fran!

15:36.184 --> 15:38.824
(screams)

15:48.102 --> 15:49.362
(upbeat music)

15:49.462 --> 15:51.821
- We were playing for
real money, right?

15:52.621 --> 15:53.521
(phone rings)

15:53.621 --> 15:55.621
- Your roll again.

15:58.100 --> 15:59.760
- Fran,
have you done the deal yet?

15:59.860 --> 16:02.719
- We've had to move rooms.

16:02.819 --> 16:05.719
Long story, but basically we hired
Daniel-fucking-Day-Lewis

16:05.819 --> 16:07.358
and he's gone full method, mate.

16:07.458 --> 16:08.798
- Okay, I'm good news.

16:08.898 --> 16:12.357
Jackson is very much dead for
real this time.

16:12.457 --> 16:13.397
- Thank fuck for that.

16:13.497 --> 16:14.917
- There is a little
bit of bad news.

16:15.017 --> 16:17.556
- Yeah, if this is about Kat's
sofa, I am just not interested.

16:17.656 --> 16:18.956
- The drugs are fake.

16:19.056 --> 16:20.796
- What?

16:20.896 --> 16:25.855
Which room are you in?
Fran, Fran?

16:27.855 --> 16:31.434
- I give up.
This guy plays like he's

16:31.534 --> 16:32.514
got nothing to lose.

16:32.614 --> 16:34.273
Let's just finish
the deal, my friend.

16:34.373 --> 16:36.233
So before you take
any more of my money.

16:36.333 --> 16:37.593
- That's a great idea.

16:37.693 --> 16:40.472
We could do a quick swap
and then go our separate ways.

16:40.572 --> 16:44.551
- Usually we check a new
supplier's project for purity.

16:44.651 --> 16:47.151
But we shared this
time together

16:47.251 --> 16:48.871
and I won't insult your honor.

16:48.971 --> 16:52.350
- You're a very reasonable man.
- Dema!

16:52.450 --> 16:53.670
- Whoa, Whoa,
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa.

16:53.770 --> 16:58.189
I don't want special
treatment, test it.

16:58.289 --> 16:59.669
- I'm sorry, boss

16:59.769 --> 17:01.588
but he said he did not
want to insult your honor.

17:01.688 --> 17:03.028
- I want the word out there.

17:03.128 --> 17:04.548
The Jackson Reynard's got

17:04.648 --> 17:08.347
the purest white
on the goddamn block.

17:08.447 --> 17:11.566
- Okay, let's test it.
- Okay boss.

17:12.326 --> 17:14.326
- You're gonna love it.

17:15.126 --> 17:21.545
(upbeat music)

17:21.645 --> 17:27.124
(upbeat music)

17:27.923 --> 17:28.663
- Fran,

17:28.763 --> 17:30.623
which room are you in?

17:30.723 --> 17:32.103
You need to call me back.

17:32.203 --> 17:34.142
I need to get a move on.

17:34.242 --> 17:36.962
The sofa has just passed
the overhead.

17:39.121 --> 17:41.121
- Boss.
- Fran?

17:42.321 --> 17:44.320
Sorry.

17:46.800 --> 17:48.940
- We need to go now.
- Just a couple more minutes.

17:49.040 --> 17:50.619
- No. You need to listen
to me right now.

17:50.719 --> 17:53.019
- We're reaching the
climax of the show.

17:53.119 --> 17:55.198
- I think the climax has
been reached here.

17:57.638 --> 17:59.298
- Fran?
Sorry.

17:59.398 --> 18:02.397
- Want to join us?
- No.

18:05.197 --> 18:07.096
Jackson, it's
been a blast.

18:07.196 --> 18:10.496
but I'm afraid we must
conclude our proceedings.

18:10.596 --> 18:12.855
- Just when I was starting
to enjoy myself.

18:12.955 --> 18:17.454
- Unfortunately, it's getting
late and your luck has run out!

18:17.554 --> 18:19.294
(screaming)

18:19.394 --> 18:21.893
- Do you think I'm
a fool, Jackson?

18:21.993 --> 18:24.393
The drugs, they're fake.

18:28.432 --> 18:30.692
- How dare you?

18:30.792 --> 18:34.931
You're calling
Jackson Reynard a liar?

18:35.031 --> 18:38.330
You better be pretty damn sure
because if you're wrong,

18:38.430 --> 18:40.650
I won't come at you
with everything I've got.

18:40.750 --> 18:42.130
- He doesn't mean it.

18:42.230 --> 18:43.569
- So tell me a little snack.

18:43.669 --> 18:46.209
How do you know one of your
goons hasn't double crossed

18:46.309 --> 18:47.529
you? Swapped out the drugs

18:47.629 --> 18:49.648
because I see a lot
of hungry dogs out of here.

18:49.748 --> 18:51.748
Ever thought about that?

18:52.228 --> 18:53.568
Didn't think so.
- Bullshit.

18:53.668 --> 18:55.727
- Maybe.
But you and I both know you

18:55.827 --> 18:58.247
haven't got the balls
to pull that trigger.

18:58.347 --> 19:00.366
In fact, do it.

19:00.466 --> 19:02.926
I dare you.

19:03.026 --> 19:06.245
I double dare you,
mother fucker.

19:06.345 --> 19:07.525
- Very, very sorry.

19:07.625 --> 19:09.885
There's been a terrible
misunderstanding and I

19:09.985 --> 19:13.284
can explain everything.
- You better explain pretty

19:13.384 --> 19:16.583
fucking quick or both your
brains
will be on the fucking ceiling.

19:17.103 --> 19:18.283
- Sorry, wrong room.

19:18.383 --> 19:20.123
Oh, this is the right room.

19:20.223 --> 19:21.722
- Who the fuck are you?

19:21.822 --> 19:25.102
- You should have killed me
while you had the chance.

19:25.542 --> 19:30.541
(gunshots)

19:34.900 --> 19:38.539
(gunshots)

19:42.578 --> 19:46.858
(gunshots)

19:54.816 --> 19:56.636
- What the?

19:56.736 --> 19:58.735
- Oh.

20:02.615 --> 20:04.614
- Oh, my God.

20:05.974 --> 20:08.774
That was so realistic.

20:09.533 --> 20:11.393
So are they all
wearing blood bags, is it?

20:11.493 --> 20:13.733
- Yeah, blood
bags, yeah.

20:14.333 --> 20:16.812
Jamie, could you
get the money?

20:17.332 --> 20:18.152
Thank you.

20:18.252 --> 20:19.632
- I've never done one of these

20:19.732 --> 20:21.551
where everyone
is so committed.

20:21.651 --> 20:24.891
Such attention to detail
and the strong work lads.

20:25.611 --> 20:27.350
Should I say goodbye?
- They're pretty method.

20:27.450 --> 20:29.390
So I think they'll be
playing dead for a while.

20:29.490 --> 20:30.870
- So into it.

20:30.970 --> 20:32.389
I love it.

20:32.489 --> 20:35.069
Kiren Roberts,
Magnetic Talent.

20:35.169 --> 20:36.269
Leave me a Yelp review.

20:36.369 --> 20:37.388
I'd really appreciate it.

20:37.488 --> 20:39.508
- Can I take one of these?
- Yeah, sure.

20:39.608 --> 20:40.748
I'm just gonna go get changed.

20:40.848 --> 20:41.588
Peace out.

20:41.688 --> 20:43.687
Well done, everyone.

20:47.486 --> 20:50.806
- All right, so everyone
who should be dead is dead.

20:51.206 --> 20:53.305
Really? Now?
- I promised Kat.

20:53.405 --> 20:55.585
- Why can't you just be
in the moment?

20:55.685 --> 20:58.124
This job is done,
we're gonna go to Japan?

20:59.364 --> 21:02.024
I'm sorry, but I just want
to go home and get my sofa.

21:02.124 --> 21:04.343
- That's not your home or
your sofa, is it?

21:04.443 --> 21:06.943
- I sleep there.
So it is my home.

21:07.043 --> 21:08.543
- Once slept in an Iceland

21:08.643 --> 21:09.782
shopping trolley,
was that your home?

21:09.882 --> 21:11.882
- It was for that night.
Yeah.

21:12.482 --> 21:14.341
Kat trusts me
with important

21:14.441 --> 21:16.301
things, and I don't
want to let her down.

21:16.401 --> 21:17.301
- No.
Absolutely.

21:17.401 --> 21:19.021
Well, that's your choice.

21:19.121 --> 21:21.120
So, off you go.

21:21.920 --> 21:23.900
- I will.
- Good.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.099
- I'm going.
- Good.

21:25.199 --> 21:27.199
Off you go.

21:27.519 --> 21:29.619
Oh god, not the
boobs again.

21:29.719 --> 21:31.718
Off.

21:32.278 --> 21:34.278
