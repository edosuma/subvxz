17:17.709 --> 17:19.375
But he’s okay now.

17:19.375 --> 17:20.875
HEATHER: Oh, good, good.

17:20.875 --> 17:22.750
COLLEEN: Oh, hey, guys!
-Hey, just wanted

17:22.750 --> 17:25.333
to thank you again
for inviting us last minute.

17:25.333 --> 17:28.041
-Yeah.
-This, this is for Lark.

17:28.041 --> 17:29.458
-Oh!
MATT: A beautiful rose

17:29.458 --> 17:31.208
for a beautiful
one-year-old girl.

17:31.208 --> 17:33.792
Yeah, it’s fresh
from our garden.

17:33.792 --> 17:35.917
-Ah.
MATT: Or, uh, from the,

17:35.917 --> 17:38.542
-gas station on the way here.
-Yeah.

17:38.542 --> 17:40.834
-Should we do the cake?
-And the camera.

17:40.834 --> 17:42.834
Yes, let me get
the camera ready.

17:42.834 --> 17:45.542
VICKI: Hello!

17:45.542 --> 17:48.083
Where’s the birthday girl,
or groom?

17:48.083 --> 17:49.417
I’m not sure what this is.

17:49.417 --> 17:50.834
Vicki, come on in!

17:50.834 --> 17:51.917
Hey, guys!

17:51.917 --> 17:53.792
This is my present to Lark,

17:53.792 --> 17:55.709
a real live princess.

17:55.709 --> 17:57.375
Dad, uh...

17:57.375 --> 17:59.250
(stammering)

17:59.250 --> 18:00.625
What is going on?

18:00.625 --> 18:03.875
Oh, Vicki is the drink cart
girl at the club.

18:03.875 --> 18:07.291
I asked her what she did
on the side for extra money,

18:07.291 --> 18:09.709
-and she said this.
JOAN: John,

18:09.709 --> 18:11.542
why would you ask her that?

18:11.542 --> 18:13.542
Oh, I was just
making conversation.

18:13.542 --> 18:16.834
Why does anyone ask
anybody anything?

18:16.834 --> 18:18.375
VICKI: Oh, I have
a pair of those.

18:18.375 --> 18:20.083
Well, now you have two.

18:20.083 --> 18:21.834
Hey, let’s get the picture
thing goin’, right,

18:21.834 --> 18:23.250
while Lark’s still
in a good mood?

18:23.250 --> 18:25.083
GREG: I got the camera, guys,
let’s all gather around,

18:25.083 --> 18:27.000
take a photo with Lark, okay?

18:27.000 --> 18:28.667
(baby crying)

18:28.667 --> 18:30.875
JEN: Oh, no,
no, no, no, no, no!

18:30.875 --> 18:33.667
-No, no, she’s crying!
-I think she’s teething.

18:33.667 --> 18:35.542
-Yeah.
JOAN: Oh, give her to me.

18:35.542 --> 18:37.750
I’ve got a great
remedy for teething!

18:37.750 --> 18:39.125
-Really?
-Oh, yes, I do.

18:39.125 --> 18:41.250
-I’ll bring her right back.
-Okay.

18:41.250 --> 18:42.875
-I’m gonna get the cake.
-Yeah, I got the camera,

18:42.875 --> 18:44.875
I just need you to tell me
which filter do you want?

18:44.875 --> 18:47.166
I got Polaroid transfer,
unfinished basement,

18:47.166 --> 18:48.959
or grainy in Paris.

18:48.959 --> 18:51.125
No, I don’t know what
you’re saying, but no.

18:51.125 --> 18:52.291

JEN: Joan, what did you do,
she’s like unconscious?

19:17.875 --> 19:21.625
Well, I just rubbed a little
whiskey on her gums.

19:21.625 --> 19:22.792
You did what?

19:22.792 --> 19:25.041
JOAN: Yeah, it always works
like a charm!

19:25.041 --> 19:27.583
But, you, you, you,
you gave her alcohol?

19:27.583 --> 19:30.291
JOHN: Oh, sure, my mom used
to rub whiskey on my gums

19:30.291 --> 19:34.750
when I was a baby,
and it had no effect on me.

19:34.750 --> 19:37.834
Vicki, this was supposed
to be a double.

19:37.834 --> 19:39.125
-Mom?
-I mean, she’s like

19:39.125 --> 19:40.458
blackout drunk.

19:40.458 --> 19:42.625
She’s a little sleeping angel.

19:42.625 --> 19:44.875
All we wanted was a photo
of Lark on her first birthday,

19:44.875 --> 19:46.417
now she’s too
wasted to be in it.

19:46.417 --> 19:48.458
No, you know what,

we’re still gonna
