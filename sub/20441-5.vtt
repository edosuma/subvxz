00:05.866 --> 00:07.199
Jian Yang!

00:07.407 --> 00:09.574
-You have to finish SeeFood.
-This is fucking stupid.

00:09.574 --> 00:10.699
Oh, here's one more for you.

00:12.908 --> 00:14.824
Jian Yang unwittingly crafted

00:14.824 --> 00:16.783
an amazing tool for
the real time detection

00:16.783 --> 00:18.032
of penile imagery.

00:18.282 --> 00:22.491
I would say "not safe for work,"
but this is your work...

00:22.990 --> 00:24.240
for a year...

00:25.032 --> 00:25.949
at least.

00:26.574 --> 00:30.741
Her name is Mia,
and she is a-mia-zing.

00:30.741 --> 00:31.824
I did sex on her.

00:31.824 --> 00:33.491
Mia is a legit hacker.

00:33.491 --> 00:35.866
What do you think she'll do
if you try to break up with her?

00:37.032 --> 00:40.741
Potentially this will render
every server obsolete.

00:40.741 --> 00:41.949
Holy shit!

00:41.949 --> 00:43.990
You know what? Actually,
I'm gonna...

00:43.990 --> 00:45.491
Welcome to the future, Gavin.

00:46.366 --> 00:48.115
Whoa. Oh, no. Oh, no!

00:48.115 --> 00:49.491
- Son of a bitch!

01:03.908 --> 01:05.908
This is where
it all began, gentlemen.

01:05.908 --> 01:08.574
The birthplace
of Hooli.

01:08.574 --> 01:10.949
Peter Gregory's
mother's garage.

01:12.240 --> 01:14.157
That was
Peter's workstation.

01:15.324 --> 01:16.532
This was mine.

01:16.532 --> 01:18.532
Things sure have changed.

01:18.532 --> 01:22.783
But in a way,
they've stayed exactly the same.

01:22.783 --> 01:25.324
As we forge
our new path together,

01:25.324 --> 01:28.157
we must remain focused
on what's really important--

01:28.157 --> 01:29.908
not material success
or wealth,

01:29.908 --> 01:33.949
but this, the spirit
of innovation--

01:33.949 --> 01:37.824
a few coders,
some ramen,
and a dream.

01:37.824 --> 01:40.157
And that is why
I brought you here.

01:40.157 --> 01:42.616
All right. Let me show you
the rest of the place.

01:47.324 --> 01:50.658
Ah. You've got a garage
inside your garage.

01:50.658 --> 01:51.824
Impressive.

02:04.157 --> 02:06.658
I'll move you in as soon as
construction is complete.

02:06.658 --> 02:08.157
It's going to be exquisite.

02:08.157 --> 02:10.366
Frank Gehry has
really outdone himself.

02:10.366 --> 02:13.240
Yeah. Frank is the fucking best.

02:13.240 --> 02:14.866
He does all my buildings.

02:14.866 --> 02:16.866
- Okay, guys.
- We're all set up.

02:16.866 --> 02:18.074
Shall we?

02:18.074 --> 02:20.866
Yes! Let's do it,
of course.

02:20.866 --> 02:24.532
All right. So, in building
this peer-to-peer Internet,

02:24.532 --> 02:26.616
the paradox
that we're up against is

02:26.616 --> 02:30.407
that people won't want
to participate until
the quality is high,

02:30.407 --> 02:35.699
and the quality
won't be high until, um...

02:35.699 --> 02:37.990
and the quality
won't be high

02:37.990 --> 02:41.074
until we have a lot of people
opt in to the network,

02:41.074 --> 02:44.199
so that presents
a little bit of a-a--
a unique...

02:45.532 --> 02:46.824
Continue.

02:46.824 --> 02:48.658
Oh. Uh, okay.

02:48.658 --> 02:51.658
It presents a bit
of a problem what with

02:51.658 --> 02:53.908
that we kind of need
to build-- Oh.

02:55.074 --> 02:56.366
Uh...

02:56.366 --> 02:58.741
Richard,
everything okay?

02:58.741 --> 02:59.866
I don't know. Is it?

02:59.866 --> 03:03.990
Oh, sorry.
Guys, Bryce.
Bryce, guys.

03:03.990 --> 03:05.783
Uh, actually, we've met.

03:05.783 --> 03:07.366
Oh. Hey, Donald.

03:07.366 --> 03:08.741
Uh, it's Jared now.

03:10.366 --> 03:12.908
- So, Gavin.
- Bryce is...?

03:12.908 --> 03:14.199
Very discreet.

03:14.199 --> 03:15.574
Keep going.
This is great.

03:15.574 --> 03:16.908
Uh, is Bryce
your assistant?

03:16.908 --> 03:19.783
No, of course not.
He's my transfusion
associate.

03:19.783 --> 03:21.407
Which is?

03:21.407 --> 03:23.616
Are you really not familiar
with parabiosis?

03:23.616 --> 03:25.282
Can't say that I am.

03:25.282 --> 03:27.449
Well, the science is
actually pretty fascinating.

03:27.449 --> 03:31.449
Regular transfusions
of the blood of a younger,
physically fit donor

03:31.449 --> 03:33.783
can significantly retard
the aging process.

03:33.783 --> 03:37.282
And Bryce is
a picture of health.

03:37.282 --> 03:40.574
Just look at him.
He looks like a Nazi
propaganda poster.

03:40.574 --> 03:42.115
Oh.

03:48.324 --> 03:50.282
This is quite
the baby shower.

03:50.282 --> 03:52.491
I bet you think you're
some big swinging dick,

03:52.491 --> 03:56.032
now that you're getting invited
to all these fancy VC soirees.

03:56.032 --> 03:59.115
Yes. My dick is
very enormous...

03:59.115 --> 04:01.532
and my app made Raviga
a lot of money.

04:01.532 --> 04:03.783
And I still pay no rent.

04:03.783 --> 04:06.199
Nobody likes a braggart,
Jian-Yang.

04:06.199 --> 04:07.699
Hey, guys.

04:07.699 --> 04:09.824
Hello. Congratulations.
You're pregnant.

04:09.824 --> 04:11.783
No, no, no. No, she--
No, she-- No, no.

04:11.783 --> 04:12.824
Uh-uh.

04:14.074 --> 04:16.281
FYI, Monica,

04:16.281 --> 04:19.574
my invite
must have gotten lost
in the e-mail,

04:19.574 --> 04:21.908
but young Jinathin
was kind enough

04:21.908 --> 04:23.366
to add me
as his plus-one.

04:23.366 --> 04:26.866
Don't look at me.
This is all Ed Chen's doing.

04:26.866 --> 04:29.574
Is that Aarush Agrawal?

04:29.574 --> 04:32.449
Mm-hmm.
I thought he retired.

04:32.449 --> 04:34.115
He's still on the board.

04:34.115 --> 04:37.074
What would a cofounder
of Raviga be doing...

04:37.074 --> 04:38.658
at a baby shower?

04:38.658 --> 04:41.324
How often is
he even in the building?
Like once a year.

04:41.324 --> 04:44.324
Ed Chen threw this whole thing
just to suck up to Laurie.

04:46.032 --> 04:47.324
Monica...

04:47.324 --> 04:48.574
this is not
a baby shower.

04:48.574 --> 04:49.908
This is a coup.

04:49.908 --> 04:51.366
What are
you talking about?

04:51.366 --> 04:55.658
Ed Chen didn't
throw this party
to impress Laurie.

04:55.658 --> 04:57.449
He threw it
to oust her.

04:57.449 --> 04:59.699
Invite all these
misogynistic A-holes

04:59.699 --> 05:01.199
who think that pregnancy
is a weakness,

05:01.199 --> 05:02.866
convince them
that she's shirking

05:02.866 --> 05:04.574
her responsibilities
at Raviga.

05:04.574 --> 05:05.949
You said it yourself,

05:05.949 --> 05:07.658
there's more dick
in here

05:07.658 --> 05:09.908
than a synthetic pussy
convention.

05:12.032 --> 05:13.990
I didn't say
anything close to that.

05:13.990 --> 05:15.658
No?
No.

05:15.658 --> 05:19.449
Regardless, Ed Chen
and Aarush are bro'ing down.

05:19.449 --> 05:23.032
I suggest you get in
before you get cut out.

05:23.032 --> 05:24.199
You see this guy?

05:24.199 --> 05:25.824
Tequila shots
at a baby shower.

05:25.824 --> 05:27.324
You want me to join
the frat house?

05:27.324 --> 05:29.407
Unfortunately,
in this climate, Monica,

05:29.407 --> 05:32.074
you either bro down
or you go down.
Monica.

05:33.407 --> 05:35.032
Laurie is also pregnant.

05:35.032 --> 05:37.449
Jian-Yang, are you
drinking creamer?

05:38.449 --> 05:39.908
It's half-half.

05:41.741 --> 05:45.074
Which brings us
to our one final,
crucial question.

05:45.074 --> 05:47.741
What value can we offer
now to the user

05:47.741 --> 05:51.240
to entice them
to download the app
and opt in to our network?

05:51.240 --> 05:52.449
And the answer is...

05:54.741 --> 05:56.949
the brand-new
Pied Piper app.

05:56.949 --> 05:58.990
The app will take
all of the data

05:58.990 --> 06:00.783
on a person's phone
and compress it,

06:00.783 --> 06:02.741
freeing up
20 percent more storage.

06:02.741 --> 06:05.407
They can have half
of that free memory,

06:05.407 --> 06:06.783
while we will take
the other half,

06:06.783 --> 06:10.449
walled off on their phone,
for our own future use.

06:10.449 --> 06:12.157
- It's a win-win.
- Mmm.

06:12.157 --> 06:14.115
That's very well thought out.

06:14.115 --> 06:15.324
Well done, gentlemen.

06:15.324 --> 06:18.449
So, when do we announce?

06:18.449 --> 06:19.449
Announce what?

06:19.449 --> 06:22.282
Richard,
when I do something,
it's news.

06:22.282 --> 06:24.491
Don't you think
you want to lean into that?

06:24.491 --> 06:27.282
We'll announce,
rack up huge user interest,

06:27.282 --> 06:30.449
and then do a massive
public launch at scale.

06:30.449 --> 06:33.240
Uh, no. We planned this
under the assumption

06:33.240 --> 06:34.990
that it would be
rolling out quietly

06:34.990 --> 06:38.199
and not really talking
about our ultimate intentions.

06:38.199 --> 06:41.199
Besides, rolling out at scale
is a completely different model

06:41.199 --> 06:44.199
with vastly different technical
and business challenges.

06:44.199 --> 06:46.783
And we're
not prepared for that.
No. I think we'd all agree

06:46.783 --> 06:49.157
that a-- a stealth rollout
would be best for this one.

06:49.157 --> 06:50.449
Mmm.

06:52.699 --> 06:53.699
Bryce?

06:54.908 --> 06:55.990
Did you have a thought?

06:55.990 --> 06:57.324
Uh, well...

06:57.324 --> 06:59.491
you know, it just seems
like a missed opportunity.

06:59.491 --> 07:00.866
I mean,
shouldn't you figure out

07:00.866 --> 07:02.658
how a big launch
would work

07:02.658 --> 07:03.990
before you
just say no to it?

07:04.908 --> 07:07.240
Hmm.
Or-- Or not.

07:07.240 --> 07:08.783
You know,
it's not my company.

07:08.783 --> 07:09.949
That is so true.

07:09.949 --> 07:11.908
You know, Richard,
Bryce makes a good point.

07:11.908 --> 07:14.407
Why don't you guys just whip up
an alternate launch plan

07:14.407 --> 07:17.282
with a big public rollout,
and then we can compare
apples to apples.

07:17.282 --> 07:19.032
Gavin, all-all--
all due respect.

07:19.032 --> 07:21.616
This plan took
two weeks to develop.

07:21.616 --> 07:23.741
Hard work is the price
of greatness,

07:23.741 --> 07:25.115
so let's get to work.

07:28.699 --> 07:29.949
Woo!

07:29.949 --> 07:34.032
Well, this meeting was
just absolutely fucking great!

07:34.032 --> 07:37.282
Richard, Donald...
Goldfoil!

07:39.574 --> 07:41.532
Woo!

07:41.532 --> 07:43.032
Go team!

07:43.032 --> 07:44.699
Woo!

07:44.699 --> 07:47.658
Uh... the fuck
just happened?

07:47.658 --> 07:49.866
Hey, Bryce?
Yeah?

07:49.866 --> 07:52.990
Wh-- uh, next time
you're at a meeting
of our company,

07:52.990 --> 07:55.282
of which you
are not a part of
in any respect,

07:55.282 --> 07:58.032
can you please keep
your little ideas to yourself?

07:58.032 --> 08:00.866
I'm-- I'm sorry. I'm just--
I'm just trying to be helpful.

08:00.866 --> 08:02.366
Well, you weren't, at all.

08:02.366 --> 08:03.699
I mean, we had him
on our side,

08:03.699 --> 08:05.990
because I'd basically
just convinced Gavin

08:05.990 --> 08:08.199
that a stealth rollout
was the best idea.

08:08.199 --> 08:09.866
Uh, you know,
well, I--

08:09.866 --> 08:13.074
It's just a stealth rollout
doesn't sound like the way
to go to me.

08:13.074 --> 08:14.741
What-What--
What are you
talking about?

08:14.741 --> 08:18.783
I mean, Gavin has obviously
had a lot more success
than you, Richard,

08:18.783 --> 08:21.407
and I just think having
an asset like Gavin Belson

08:21.407 --> 08:22.908
on your side--
What'd you say?

08:22.908 --> 08:24.240
You dick!
Whoa!

08:24.240 --> 08:25.658
You dick! You dick!

08:25.658 --> 08:26.990
Okay.
Whoa. All right.

08:26.990 --> 08:28.699
Fuck you!
Okay. It's okay.

08:28.699 --> 08:31.574
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's okay. It's okay.

08:31.574 --> 08:34.366
This is already
the best job I ever had.

08:39.948 --> 08:43.866
I don't know what to say.
I am so, so sorry.

08:43.866 --> 08:46.491
I just couldn't let Bryce
talk to you like that.

08:46.491 --> 08:48.449
- Did I frighten you?
- No.

08:48.449 --> 08:49.990
Fuck him, right?

08:49.990 --> 08:51.324
And fuck Gavin.

08:51.324 --> 08:53.491
I mean, what,
we take his orders now?
He's our boss?

08:53.491 --> 08:56.074
We're supposed to be partners,
you know, like equals. Right?

08:56.074 --> 08:57.366
And what?
He's taking the advice

08:57.366 --> 08:59.115
of that stupid,
little pretty boy over me?

08:59.115 --> 09:02.574
Wait. He has a garage
in his garage?

09:02.574 --> 09:04.491
And he has a yacht
with a pool on it

09:04.491 --> 09:06.532
and a pool
with a yacht in it.

09:06.532 --> 09:08.741
And he has a real,
live blood boy.

09:08.741 --> 09:11.449
What? He has
an actual blood boy?

09:11.449 --> 09:12.449
That's real?

09:12.449 --> 09:14.240
Yeah, he's real.
Real mouthy.

09:14.240 --> 09:16.658
I mean, he's sticking
his perfectly symmetrical face

09:16.658 --> 09:18.616
into actual
smart people's business.

09:18.616 --> 09:21.449
I mean, that Ken doll
probably thinks traversing
a binary search tree

09:21.449 --> 09:25.157
runs in the order of "n,"
instead of "log n." Idiot.

09:25.157 --> 09:26.407
Jared called him a dick.

09:26.407 --> 09:28.783
Seriously?
To his face? No.

09:28.783 --> 09:30.949
- Yeah.
- That sounds awesome.

09:30.949 --> 09:33.949
But it's probably nothing
compared to the thousands
upon thousands

09:33.949 --> 09:35.658
of gnarled male genitals

09:35.658 --> 09:37.866
that you get to see
every day at your job.

09:37.866 --> 09:39.491
Fuck.

09:40.532 --> 09:42.032
Hey.
Hi.

09:42.032 --> 09:44.658
Brought you
some dinner, 'Neshi.
Thank you.

09:44.658 --> 09:45.699
"'Neshi"?

09:45.699 --> 09:47.491
Shut the fuck up,
Gilfoyle.

09:47.491 --> 09:49.824
You just missed
these idiots

09:49.824 --> 09:51.407
telling me how hard
they're selling out

09:51.407 --> 09:53.741
by working
for fucking Galvin Belson

09:53.741 --> 09:55.824
in his disgusting
lap of luxury.

09:55.824 --> 09:58.658
Seriously,
how can you work
for that asshole?

09:58.658 --> 10:01.157
My man,
the Gavin Killer,

10:01.157 --> 10:03.491
would never compromise
his principles for money.

10:03.491 --> 10:04.658
Oh, no?

10:04.658 --> 10:06.240
No, he would not.

10:06.240 --> 10:08.324
And he is busy
doing the rewarding work

10:08.324 --> 10:12.491
of keeping the Internet free
of graphic sexual imagery.

10:14.032 --> 10:15.616
Hey, can we eat later?

10:15.616 --> 10:17.449
Of course.

10:17.449 --> 10:19.199
I'm gonna go
put this in the fridge.

10:19.199 --> 10:21.199
Okay. Yeah. Thank you.

10:21.199 --> 10:24.574
Hey, you actually
still haven't told her

10:24.574 --> 10:26.157
that your takedown
of Gavin Belson...
Shh!

10:26.157 --> 10:28.032
...- was an accident?
- It hasn't come up.

10:28.032 --> 10:29.866
We were just talking
about him...

10:29.866 --> 10:31.866
...with her,
so it did come up.
Just...

10:31.866 --> 10:33.949
Gavin. Hello.
Hey, could you--

10:33.949 --> 10:36.866
Richard, did you and a member
of your team verbally assault

10:36.866 --> 10:38.658
my transfusion associate?

10:38.658 --> 10:40.699
Do you have any idea
what that kind of stress

10:40.699 --> 10:42.074
could do
to his cortisol levels?

10:42.074 --> 10:44.199
And therefore,
my cortisol levels?

10:44.199 --> 10:47.949
Y-- Yeah. Well, uh,
he's not technically
in the company,

10:47.949 --> 10:49.699
and he kind
of just butted in, so--

10:49.699 --> 10:51.074
Is your ego so fragile

10:51.074 --> 10:52.949
that if someone
disagrees with you,

10:52.949 --> 10:54.532
you have to demean them?

10:54.532 --> 10:58.407
I want you
to go and apologize
to Bryce immediately.

10:58.407 --> 10:59.908
Why should I apologize?

10:59.908 --> 11:01.366
Why should I be
in business

11:01.366 --> 11:03.658
with someone
who treats support staff
with such contempt?

11:03.658 --> 11:05.407
You can tell a lot
about a person's character

11:05.407 --> 11:07.074
by how they treat
the little people, Richard.

11:07.074 --> 11:08.824
I bet you're mean
to waiters, too.

11:08.824 --> 11:11.741
What? No.
I'm-- I'm awesome to waiters.

11:11.741 --> 11:14.532
Well, then I suggest
you be awesome
to Bryce, too.

11:14.532 --> 11:16.990
His blood is flowing
through my veins, Richard.

11:16.990 --> 11:19.032
Make this right.

11:20.574 --> 11:22.449
Fucking blood boy.

11:27.032 --> 11:28.491
What do you want,
Richard?

11:28.491 --> 11:32.366
Bryce, I wanted
to swing by and apologize

11:32.366 --> 11:34.074
for yelling at you
when you offered

11:34.074 --> 11:36.240
your very unsolicited opinion.

11:36.240 --> 11:38.741
Also, on behalf of Jared,

11:38.741 --> 11:42.616
we mean no disrespect to you
or your career choice. Okay?

11:42.616 --> 11:43.866
My career choice?

11:43.866 --> 11:46.115
You think
that I moved out here
to be a blood boy?

11:46.115 --> 11:48.491
Did you know I have
a degree in CS?
You do?

11:48.491 --> 11:51.908
Yeah, but you probably
thought that I was just,
you know, some dumb jock.

11:51.908 --> 11:54.949
Well, that's typical,
because people who look
like me,

11:54.949 --> 11:57.616
we never get taken seriously
in the tech business

11:57.616 --> 11:59.240
by people
who look like you.

11:59.240 --> 12:00.449
You're biased.

12:00.449 --> 12:02.741
Whoa. Hang on.
I am not biased. Okay?

12:02.741 --> 12:05.366
Aw, come on!
Hey, the whole business
is biased!

12:05.366 --> 12:07.366
I mean, that's the only way
that a good-looking guy like me

12:07.366 --> 12:10.282
could get
in a room with Gavin Belson,
is by being a blood boy!

12:10.282 --> 12:13.282
And that sucks.
I-- I got to work out
constantly.

12:13.282 --> 12:15.658
I can't have
a beer with my friends.
I can't eat junk food.

12:15.658 --> 12:18.115
Do you know that Gavin
made me go full veg?

12:18.115 --> 12:19.574
I mean, fuck soy, man!

12:19.574 --> 12:22.491
But to people
like you, I'm just
a beautiful bag of blood.

12:22.491 --> 12:25.616
But you know what?
I got some pretty good
fucking ideas,

12:25.616 --> 12:27.699
and Gavin actually listens
to those ideas.

12:27.699 --> 12:29.658
It took a while,
but he respects me.

12:29.658 --> 12:31.074
And you know what,
Richard Hendricks?

12:31.074 --> 12:32.990
You clearly
fucking don't.

12:32.990 --> 12:34.658
So good night.
W--

12:39.658 --> 12:41.824
Hey, look,
it's Osama Bin Fuckin'.

12:41.824 --> 12:43.407
Thought you were staying
at Mia's tonight.

12:43.407 --> 12:47.157
I was going to,
but, alas, I had
some intestinal distress,

12:47.157 --> 12:50.032
so I couldn't stay,
which really sucks
because she's so great,

12:50.032 --> 12:52.157
which really is horrible,
because it's so hard

12:52.157 --> 12:54.491
to be away from her,
because she's so great.
Can I contin...

12:55.491 --> 12:58.032
I have no diarrhea.
I lied.

12:58.032 --> 13:01.658
I am so fucked.
This girl is gonna kill me

13:01.658 --> 13:04.449
or get me killed.
Do tell.

13:04.449 --> 13:07.866
So, she's super attractive,
and she's super smart,
and she's way into me,

13:07.866 --> 13:10.074
like way more than
a normal person should be.

13:10.074 --> 13:11.658
And sex!
There's so much sex!

13:11.658 --> 13:14.616
The problem is
the part after.

13:14.616 --> 13:16.074
When you have
to apologize.

13:16.074 --> 13:18.491
No. When we do
pillow talk.

13:18.491 --> 13:20.199
Oh. That's the best part.

13:20.199 --> 13:22.032
Everything before that
is just foreplay.

13:22.032 --> 13:24.282
Not with her.
She'll tell me
how cute I am,

13:24.282 --> 13:25.491
and how into me she is,

13:25.491 --> 13:27.824
and how she hacked
into Bowman Avenue dam.

13:27.824 --> 13:29.699
That was the Iranian
Revolutionary Guard.

13:29.699 --> 13:31.658
No. It was her.
She pinned it on them.

13:31.658 --> 13:35.032
She flooded
an area being surveyed
for hotel construction.

13:35.032 --> 13:38.908
Just to confirm, honesty is
off the table, right?

13:38.908 --> 13:41.282
Because it seems like
the longer you wait,

13:41.282 --> 13:43.032
the-- the worse
it's gonna get.

13:43.032 --> 13:45.282
I'm with Jared.
You should wait.

13:46.574 --> 13:48.407
I have to end it,
right now.

13:49.282 --> 13:51.074
First thing Monday.
Mmm.

13:51.074 --> 13:52.908
Well, Saturday is
her sister's wedding.

13:52.908 --> 13:56.407
And then Sunday-- you know,
Sundays are just for me,
you guys know that.

13:56.407 --> 13:57.990
Wait. Her sister's wedding?

13:57.990 --> 14:00.866
That's what
you should be afraid of.
Why?

14:00.866 --> 14:03.282
That's a threshold that
you don't want to cross.

14:03.282 --> 14:06.282
Well, I mean, weddings are
very public events

14:06.282 --> 14:09.032
with photographers
taking pictures of you

14:09.032 --> 14:10.658
indelibly tied to her.

14:10.658 --> 14:12.491
Those are forever photos.

14:12.491 --> 14:13.783
Forever.

14:13.783 --> 14:15.824
Fuck.

14:15.824 --> 14:18.199
Hey, guys.
I'm trying to find Erlich.

14:18.199 --> 14:21.115
Is he... "holding"?

14:22.783 --> 14:25.741
I'm afraid you caught me
at an inopportune time.

14:25.741 --> 14:29.616
I'm long overdue to a trip
to my dispensary,

14:29.616 --> 14:31.115
so I don't have much.

14:31.115 --> 14:32.949
But I have Bubba Kush,

14:32.949 --> 14:35.115
Chocolate Thunder,
Barbara Bush,

14:35.115 --> 14:37.824
Barbara Streisand,
Barbara Bush, Jr.--

14:37.824 --> 14:39.658
Yeah, this--
this is plenty.

14:39.658 --> 14:42.616
No, no. That--
That's actually
for my astigmatism.

14:42.616 --> 14:44.282
Okay.

14:44.282 --> 14:46.115
This is in case
of emergency only.

14:46.115 --> 14:47.949
I'll need it
if an earthquake occurs.

14:47.949 --> 14:50.157
Okay. Just give me whatever.
I don't care.

14:50.157 --> 14:52.282
It's not for me.
It's for Ed Chen.

14:52.282 --> 14:55.282
What are you up to,
clever girl?

14:55.282 --> 14:57.115
Well, I took your advice.

14:57.115 --> 15:02.115
It wasn't pretty,
but, uh, I bro'ed down
with him pretty hard.

15:02.115 --> 15:03.532
I mean,
I think I did. It's--

15:03.532 --> 15:05.449
To be honest, I was
kind of all over the map.

15:05.449 --> 15:07.616
I shotgunned a warm beer,

15:07.616 --> 15:09.658
and then I acted
all blown away

15:09.658 --> 15:12.324
when he showed me 40 minutes
of snowboarding videos

15:12.324 --> 15:14.824
set to Diplo remixes.

15:14.824 --> 15:16.157
Good on you.

15:16.157 --> 15:18.240
But it worked.

15:18.240 --> 15:20.491
I'm in. Ed copped
to everything,

15:20.491 --> 15:22.949
and said that
as long as I don't say
anything to Laurie,

15:22.949 --> 15:25.157
I have a seat
at the table.
Huh.

15:27.366 --> 15:29.990
Wait. Did he say that?
Those were his exact words?

15:29.990 --> 15:33.324
You'll have a seat
if you don't tell Laurie?

15:33.324 --> 15:35.699
Yeah. So?

15:35.699 --> 15:37.866
Oh, dear.
That does not bode
well for you.

15:37.866 --> 15:39.324
What do you mean?

15:39.324 --> 15:43.157
Well, if Ed Chen
is afraid of you saying
anything to Laurie,

15:43.157 --> 15:45.199
then that means that the deal
isn't solidified yet.

15:45.199 --> 15:47.532
He doesn't have
the votes.

15:47.532 --> 15:49.366
Unfortunately for you,
that would mean

15:49.366 --> 15:52.866
you may have put your money
on the wrong horse.

15:52.866 --> 15:56.741
So you mean
Laurie still has a chance
to survive this coup?

15:56.741 --> 15:59.574
Well, then why did
you say I should bro down
with Ed Chen?

15:59.574 --> 16:02.074
I say a lot
of things, Monica.

16:04.741 --> 16:06.699
I say a lot of things.

16:11.532 --> 16:14.240
Um...
I know you think

16:14.240 --> 16:16.866
I'm some sort
of crusading badass

16:16.866 --> 16:18.741
who built
a ticking time bomb

16:18.741 --> 16:21.866
and slipped it
to Gavin Belson
to bring him down

16:21.866 --> 16:24.366
as retribution
for his wrongdoings.

16:25.699 --> 16:27.824
But the truth is,

16:27.824 --> 16:30.407
because of my gross
incompetence

16:30.407 --> 16:34.990
during my brief
and utterly disgraceful
tenure as PiperChat CEO,

16:34.990 --> 16:38.616
I incurred
billions of dollars
in COPPA fines

16:38.616 --> 16:41.366
by exploiting
underage users,

16:41.366 --> 16:44.074
and was saved
only by my own cowardice,

16:44.074 --> 16:47.532
which led to me
throwing up on myself.

16:48.866 --> 16:51.574
Anyway,
I'll show myself out.

16:58.908 --> 17:00.908
I'm so proud of you.

17:00.908 --> 17:03.407
It took guts
for you to tell me this.

17:03.407 --> 17:04.907
Oh, no, no, no,
it didn't actually.

17:04.907 --> 17:07.406
I knew all about this.

17:07.406 --> 17:08.657
I hacked
into your phone

17:08.657 --> 17:09.907
the first night
we were together

17:09.907 --> 17:11.074
when you were
in the bathroom.

17:11.074 --> 17:12.156
I was in there a while.

17:12.156 --> 17:14.406
I was hoping that once
I earned your trust,

17:14.406 --> 17:16.616
you'd feel comfortable
telling me.

17:16.616 --> 17:18.491
And you finally did!
I did.

17:18.491 --> 17:21.281
This may sound crazy,
but if you hadn't
by this weekend,

17:21.281 --> 17:24.949
I was actually
considering disinviting you
from my sister's wedding.

17:24.949 --> 17:26.115
No way.

17:26.115 --> 17:29.199
But you trusted me
with your big secret.

17:29.199 --> 17:31.282
So I'll trust you with another
of mine.

17:31.282 --> 17:34.824
Oh, no, you don't have to.
You don't.
Shh-shh! Shh!

17:34.824 --> 17:38.366
I hacked the elevators
at the Freedom Tower.

17:38.366 --> 17:40.449
No.

17:43.282 --> 17:45.324
Fucking kill me and send me
to the horrors of heaven.

17:45.324 --> 17:47.990
It'd be better
than this shit.

17:47.990 --> 17:50.699
Guys, I know this has been
a ton of work,

17:50.699 --> 17:53.949
and we wouldn't have
to do it if pretty boy kept
his mouth shut,

17:53.949 --> 17:57.407
and the stealth launch
is still clearly the play,

17:57.407 --> 18:00.032
but now we can show Gavin
that we fleshed out
both options.

18:00.032 --> 18:02.824
And we can still push
the space-saving app...

18:02.824 --> 18:06.074
...and not talk about our new
Internet until we're ready.

18:06.074 --> 18:08.616
Ahoy, gents.
Geary Street.

18:09.574 --> 18:11.199
What, you're eating
health food now?

18:11.199 --> 18:12.532
Can you imagine?

18:20.115 --> 18:23.783
Geary Street Organics is
not a health food store?

18:23.783 --> 18:26.074
Richard, you are a stitch.

18:26.074 --> 18:27.324
No, it's my dispensary.

18:27.324 --> 18:29.532
I mean, they have
some edibles there.

18:29.532 --> 18:32.115
They're not very healthy.
Fucking blood boy.

18:37.032 --> 18:38.990
Hey.
Hey.

18:38.990 --> 18:40.699
Uh, yeah. I was walking
around your 'hood,

18:40.699 --> 18:43.199
and I thought I'd swing by,
and we could talk about tech,

18:43.199 --> 18:45.407
you know,
'cause we both know
so much about it.

18:45.407 --> 18:46.949
Cool.
Oh, man.

18:46.949 --> 18:48.616
I-I-- I don't know
if you know this,

18:48.616 --> 18:50.366
but you-- your eyes
are super red right now.

18:50.366 --> 18:52.949
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, I have allergies.

18:52.949 --> 18:54.699
Really?
This time of year? Huh.

18:54.699 --> 18:58.658
Uh, hey, um,
look, w-- what are doing?

18:58.658 --> 19:01.240
Oh, just--
just hanging, man.
Why? You paranoid?

19:01.240 --> 19:02.699
Paranoid? No.

19:02.699 --> 19:04.074
You know, Bryce,
I got to be honest,

19:04.074 --> 19:05.908
I'm a little hungry.
Do you have anything to eat?

19:05.908 --> 19:10.032
Uh, just some creatine,
protein powder, soy extract.

19:10.032 --> 19:12.949
Well, I'm kind of looking
for something a little bit
more sweet.

19:12.949 --> 19:14.949
Oh, Bryce!

19:14.949 --> 19:16.990
Yeah. That--
That's not mine.

19:16.990 --> 19:19.324
That's for my guests.
My-- My fat guests.

19:19.324 --> 19:21.532
You know, the fella
who owns the house
I live in,

19:21.532 --> 19:23.366
he buys food like this,

19:23.366 --> 19:26.282
because when he uses
the products he buys

19:26.282 --> 19:29.074
at the very same
health food store you go to,

19:29.074 --> 19:31.157
he gets cravings...

19:31.157 --> 19:32.574
for food just like this.

19:32.574 --> 19:36.115
And this stuff is
not good for your blood.

19:36.115 --> 19:38.741
Geary Street Organics isn't
a food store, is it?

19:39.699 --> 19:41.366
It's a pot dispensary.

19:41.366 --> 19:42.699
Isn't it? Ha.

19:42.699 --> 19:45.240
I got you, Bryce!
You fuckin' liar!

19:45.240 --> 19:47.699
You said you had
a degree in CS.

19:47.699 --> 19:49.240
Well, bullshit.
I checked.

19:49.240 --> 19:51.699
It's not Computer Science.

19:51.699 --> 19:54.282
It's "Calisthenic Studies."

19:54.282 --> 19:55.741
What? What?

19:55.741 --> 19:59.908
You listen to me,
you muscle-bound,
handsome Adonis.

19:59.908 --> 20:03.532
Tech is reserved
for people like me. Okay?

20:03.532 --> 20:06.074
The freaks,
the weirdos,
the misfits,

20:06.074 --> 20:07.990
the geeks,
the dweebs, the dorks!

20:07.990 --> 20:08.990
Not you.

20:09.949 --> 20:11.741
Oh, and your days

20:11.741 --> 20:14.616
of leeching off
Gavin Belson are over.

20:15.658 --> 20:16.990
Game over, blood boy.

20:16.990 --> 20:18.741
You fuckin' nerd.

20:22.282 --> 20:23.366
Laurie?

20:23.366 --> 20:24.908
Look.

20:24.908 --> 20:26.908
I know you've been unhappy
with me lately.

20:26.908 --> 20:29.990
Correct.
Look. I'm asking you
to trust me on something.

20:31.240 --> 20:33.324
Ed Chen has been making moves
behind your back

20:33.324 --> 20:36.324
with the other partners
to try and force you
out of Raviga.

20:38.032 --> 20:42.074
You are referring
to the baby shower ruse.

20:42.074 --> 20:44.741
You knew about that?
Monica, this is
my fourth child.

20:44.741 --> 20:47.574
I am no stranger
to these types
of machinations.

20:47.574 --> 20:49.949
However, I have
countervailed it with my--

20:49.949 --> 20:51.699
Your fourth child?

20:51.699 --> 20:52.824
Yes.

20:52.824 --> 20:54.824
As I was saying...

20:54.824 --> 20:56.824
I have spoken
to our top LPs

20:56.824 --> 21:00.324
and lined up enough of them
in order to leave Raviga
and start a new firm.

21:00.324 --> 21:04.824
It struck me
as a opportune time
to jump ship.

21:04.824 --> 21:07.157
Holy shit!
You're a fuckin' ninja.

21:07.157 --> 21:08.741
No.

21:08.741 --> 21:11.908
Even though
your disclosure just now

21:11.908 --> 21:14.783
had absolutely
no actionable value,

21:14.783 --> 21:17.449
it did reveal
tremendous loyalty,

21:17.449 --> 21:19.908
so... all is well now.

21:19.908 --> 21:21.990
So, you're not mad
at me anymore?

21:21.990 --> 21:23.282
No, Monica.

21:23.282 --> 21:26.990
I am a human being,
just like you,

21:26.990 --> 21:29.032
like Ed Chen...

21:29.032 --> 21:30.115
and this.

21:30.115 --> 21:31.366
Furthermore...

21:33.032 --> 21:34.574
a question, Monica.

21:34.574 --> 21:37.824
Would you care
to jump ship with me?

21:38.699 --> 21:41.532
You are, after all,
my best friend.

21:41.532 --> 21:42.699
What?

21:50.949 --> 21:53.532
Oh... fuck.

21:53.532 --> 21:54.699
What are you guys doing?

21:54.699 --> 21:55.949
Hands behind your back, now!

21:55.949 --> 21:57.532
Get your hands off me!

21:57.532 --> 21:58.990
- Oh, um, I got it.
- Ma'am, calm down.

21:58.990 --> 22:01.282
- You can't do this!
- Let her go!

22:01.282 --> 22:02.574
I want my lawyer!

22:02.574 --> 22:04.574
And just take the cuffs off.
What is the meaning of this?

22:04.574 --> 22:07.115
Dinesh,
they're arresting me!
What?

22:07.115 --> 22:08.157
Step back, sir.

22:08.157 --> 22:09.282
Good people
of the FBI,

22:09.282 --> 22:11.532
I don't know what sorts
of things you were told

22:11.532 --> 22:13.532
or who told them to you--
we may never know--

22:13.532 --> 22:15.908
but I can assure you
that this young woman is...

22:24.616 --> 22:27.240
Gavin. I'm sorry
to drop in on you,

22:27.240 --> 22:30.115
but I happened to have
a very enlightening
conversation

22:30.115 --> 22:32.074
with your
"transfusion associate."

22:32.074 --> 22:33.074
So did I.

22:33.074 --> 22:34.908
S-- S-- Sorry?

22:34.908 --> 22:36.240
Come in, Richard.

22:38.866 --> 22:39.866
Oh wow.

22:39.866 --> 22:42.616
It's all broken... again.

22:42.616 --> 22:44.574
Mind the glass.

22:46.366 --> 22:47.324
Okay.

22:47.324 --> 22:49.783
He's writing
a tell-all?

22:49.783 --> 22:52.824
Apparently, he landed
a very lucrative deal

22:52.824 --> 22:54.866
to air my dirty laundry
over the years.

22:54.866 --> 22:57.658
He said it was
his only career move left.

22:57.658 --> 23:00.449
I told you, Richard,
everything I do is news.

23:00.449 --> 23:03.658
But didn't he
sign an NDA with you?
I mean, can't you sue him?

23:03.658 --> 23:06.741
That would only prove
everything he's saying
is true and make it worse.

23:06.741 --> 23:10.074
Speaking of,
I had my blood tested
this morning.

23:10.074 --> 23:12.115
My cholesterol is
through the roof.

23:12.115 --> 23:15.658
At this rate, I'll be dead
by the age of 120.

23:15.658 --> 23:18.741
Oh, no. That--
I'm so sorry.

23:18.741 --> 23:22.199
No. Richard, I'm sorry.

23:22.199 --> 23:24.699
I told you that
a big public rollout

23:24.699 --> 23:26.574
of our product
would be good
for the company.

23:26.574 --> 23:29.157
The truth is,
I thought it would
be good for me...

23:29.157 --> 23:32.115
to change the narrative that
I'm a fraud and a failure.

23:32.115 --> 23:33.990
Come on,
Bryce is the fraud.

23:33.990 --> 23:36.908
And yet, I sat here
taking business advice
from him.

23:36.908 --> 23:38.532
A fucking blood boy.

23:38.532 --> 23:40.491
Just look at me.

23:40.491 --> 23:42.157
I'm a fraud,
and everyone knows it.

23:42.157 --> 23:45.157
And when I fell,
not one person
stood up for me.

23:45.157 --> 23:46.491
What does that say?

23:46.491 --> 23:48.532
I just think
it's all over
for me now.

23:48.532 --> 23:51.532
No, it's--
it's not over. Look...

23:51.532 --> 23:54.658
I chose to partner with you.
That-- That says something.

23:54.658 --> 23:55.908
You didn't want me.

23:55.908 --> 23:57.949
You wanted the patent.
If I had just given it to you,

23:57.949 --> 24:00.032
you would've
walked out that door
and never looked back.

24:01.032 --> 24:02.115
Fuck it!

24:05.032 --> 24:06.157
I'm done.

24:07.282 --> 24:08.616
Done? No.

24:08.616 --> 24:11.449
No, Gavin, you're not--
you're not done.

24:11.449 --> 24:13.824
I mean,
what about our company?

24:13.824 --> 24:15.824
What about the new Internet?

24:15.824 --> 24:16.866
I don't know.

24:18.532 --> 24:19.574
I don't know.

24:22.199 --> 24:23.199
Gavin, uh...

24:52.658 --> 24:54.574
Fuck you, God!

24:55.741 --> 24:58.157
What have I done
to deserve this?

25:00.491 --> 25:02.783
Yes. CJ Cantwell, please.

25:08.324 --> 25:10.949
Something you want
to share with us, Richard?

25:10.949 --> 25:13.199
I take it you saw
the interview?

25:13.199 --> 25:15.240
"Belson and Hendricks
prepare to launch

25:15.240 --> 25:17.449
a Pied Piper
product soon."

25:17.449 --> 25:19.616
So much
for a stealth rollout.

25:19.616 --> 25:21.324
You went along
with him after all.

25:21.324 --> 25:22.908
TechCrunch  and  Recode,

25:22.908 --> 25:24.741
and The Wall Street Journal
picked it up as well.

25:24.741 --> 25:26.324
I hate to invoke
the Nazarene,

25:26.324 --> 25:29.240
but, Jesus Christ,
what the fuck, Richard?

25:29.240 --> 25:32.115
Guys, in a world where...

25:32.115 --> 25:34.240
there is no Gavin Belson,

25:34.240 --> 25:37.115
yeah, the stealth rollout
was the best play.

25:37.115 --> 25:40.366
But we need his patent,
and his funding,

25:40.366 --> 25:43.157
and, also,
we need his brain.

25:43.157 --> 25:46.366
I know this is going to be
a shit-ton of work, but...

25:46.366 --> 25:49.949
Gavin is our partner.
We need him engaged.
I made the call.

25:49.949 --> 25:52.866
Well, sometimes you have
to make compromises.

25:52.866 --> 25:55.574
I mean, I once slept
with the head of an
assisted-living facility

25:55.574 --> 25:58.115
to get my friend Muriel
bumped up the wait list.

25:58.115 --> 26:00.240
Am I proud of it? No.

26:00.240 --> 26:01.449
Do I regret it?

26:03.282 --> 26:04.866
I'm out!

26:04.866 --> 26:06.824
Oh my God. Oh!

26:06.824 --> 26:08.282
Out of what exactly?

26:08.282 --> 26:09.616
My relationship!

26:09.616 --> 26:11.199
The wedding got raided.

26:11.199 --> 26:14.658
The FBI got an anonymous tip
about Mia's hacking exploits.

26:14.658 --> 26:17.866
Can you believe that?
Just my luck! I'm home free!

26:17.866 --> 26:20.532
You ratted
your girlfriend out
to the FBI,

26:20.532 --> 26:23.366
because you're
too big of a pussy
to break up with her?

26:23.366 --> 26:25.741
I'll never tell,
but yes, yes, I did.

26:25.741 --> 26:27.324
The FBI lady
hit me in the face,

26:27.324 --> 26:28.824
so Mia's never going
to suspect me.

26:28.824 --> 26:31.658
Uh, Richard,
now that Mia and I
have parted ways,

26:31.658 --> 26:35.032
can I come work
for you at Gavin's?
Please, please, please.

26:35.032 --> 26:36.908
Well, uh, yes, Dinesh,
of course.

26:36.908 --> 26:39.658
Uh, in fact,
we just announced,
so climb aboard.

26:39.658 --> 26:43.199
Awesome!
I'm going to go call Periscope,
tell them I quit.

26:43.199 --> 26:45.658
Best day ever.
No more dick pics!

26:45.658 --> 26:47.824
Uh...

26:49.699 --> 26:51.324
Hello, Gavin.

26:51.324 --> 26:54.074
Richard, I read
your little article.

26:54.074 --> 26:57.157
What you said
means a great deal.

26:57.157 --> 26:59.699
I'm sure
if the situation was reversed,
you'd do the same for me.

26:59.699 --> 27:02.741
Absolutely not.
I would've let you bleed
to death in the street.

27:02.741 --> 27:06.032
Oh.
And that gives me pause.

27:07.157 --> 27:09.366
I have a lot of work
to do, Richard.

27:09.366 --> 27:12.658
We all do, so get back
on the saddle, you.

27:12.658 --> 27:14.240
No, Richard.

27:14.240 --> 27:17.532
I have a lot work
I need to do on myself.

27:17.532 --> 27:18.866
I'm going away.

27:18.866 --> 27:20.491
For, like,
the weekend or...?

27:20.491 --> 27:22.908
- No, Richard.
- Many weekends.

27:22.908 --> 27:24.532
Weekdays as well.

27:24.532 --> 27:26.783
Where--

27:26.783 --> 27:28.699
Uh, hang on.
There's someone
at the door.

27:28.699 --> 27:30.658
- I know.
- I sent you something.

27:30.658 --> 27:32.574
Consider it
a little parting gift.

27:32.574 --> 27:35.324
Good luck
to you, Richard.

27:38.324 --> 27:39.741
It's from Gavin.

27:43.574 --> 27:44.699
What is it?

27:44.699 --> 27:46.074
It's the patent.

27:47.574 --> 27:51.866
He just signed over
full ownership to me.

27:51.866 --> 27:54.783
On the phone,
he said he was going
to go find himself.

27:55.783 --> 27:58.074
I think... Gavin's gone.

28:01.324 --> 28:03.866
Well, what about his funding?
And his brain?

28:03.866 --> 28:05.783
I think he took
both of those with him.

28:05.783 --> 28:09.115
We got one more thing.

28:21.616 --> 28:23.240
All right!
What has two thumbs,

28:23.240 --> 28:25.741
zero dick pics,
and just quit Periscope?

28:27.783 --> 28:28.908
What the fuck
is that?

28:29.783 --> 28:32.366
The biggest
dick pic of all.

You took our idea

You were just standing there.

29:48.240 --> 29:49.990
Pulling it out of you like
a newborn baby.

29:49.990 --> 29:53.032
If doctor pulls a baby out of
a pregnant woman

29:53.032 --> 29:55.074
the doctor doesn't get to
then keep the baby.

29:55.074 --> 29:56.532
Stop trying to change the
subject, Richard.

29:57.491 --> 30:00.366
We had a merger. All of our
information is on both phones.

30:00.366 --> 30:01.741
Whoa, whoa. What are you doing?

30:01.741 --> 30:03.699
Just looking at your very
embarrassing

30:03.699 --> 30:04.699
personal information.

30:05.199 --> 30:06.741
If you look at my shit,
I'm gonna look at your shit.

30:06.741 --> 30:08.491
All right. Whoa, whoa.
Easy now.

30:08.491 --> 30:10.366
I'll go balls deep
