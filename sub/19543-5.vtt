WEBVTT

00:01.919 --> 00:05.832
To get ready for the Saiyans
who would be coming in one year,

00:05.923 --> 00:10.132
Goku began heading for Kaio's World.

00:10.219 --> 00:13.757
Meanwhile, Piccolo had taken Son Gohan away,

00:13.847 --> 00:17.556
and started harsh training with him.

00:17.643 --> 00:23.980
The crybaby Gohan possessed
a tremendous dormant power.

00:27.986 --> 00:30.898
Dokkan Dokkan We're in luck

00:30.989 --> 00:34.072
Dokkan Dokkan Paradise

00:34.159 --> 00:38.198
The Genki Dama bursts away

00:38.288 --> 00:41.621
Go Go Let's do it

00:42.835 --> 00:48.626
There's a wriggling, mysterious energy

00:48.716 --> 00:54.586
I won't hold back, just you watch

00:54.680 --> 01:00.550
l'll protect you with my life

01:00.644 --> 01:06.731
Turn your courage to love into strength

01:06.817 --> 01:12.733
We'll overcome crises with carry-through spirit

01:12.823 --> 01:19.991
The tougher your opponent is,
the greater the excitement

01:21.331 --> 01:24.198
Dokkan Dokkan We're in luck

01:24.293 --> 01:27.501
Dokkan Dokkan Now's our chance

01:27.588 --> 01:33.128
Whooshing along on the lucky wind

01:33.218 --> 01:36.085
Dokkan Dokkan We're in luck

01:36.180 --> 01:39.343
Dokkan Dokkan Tomorrow, as well

01:39.433 --> 01:46.475
Your soul already knows the answer

01:46.565 --> 01:50.183
Dragon Soul!

01:52.905 --> 01:58.650
"Wilderness Survival!
A Moonlit Night Awakens Gohan. "

02:00.000 --> 02:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here

02:20.599 --> 02:25.593
W-What should I do for training?

02:25.687 --> 02:31.353
At first, you don't have
to do anything. Just live.

02:31.443 --> 02:33.900
Live?

02:33.987 --> 02:37.479
If, after six months, you've managed to survive,

02:37.574 --> 02:39.656
|'|| teach you how to fight.

02:42.871 --> 02:48.707
No! I'll be so lonely, l'll die!

02:48.794 --> 02:50.785
You won't be lonely.

02:50.879 --> 02:55.122
This area is crawling with bloodthirsty beasts.

02:55.217 --> 03:00.337
Oh, no! Don't do this!

03:00.430 --> 03:01.636
Don't leave me here!

03:01.723 --> 03:06.934
You don't have time to be this spoiled now!

03:07.020 --> 03:08.476
But I...

03:08.564 --> 03:11.021
Manage to survive this six months somehow,

03:11.108 --> 03:13.724
and gain a little toughness first.

03:13.819 --> 03:17.357
Both physically and mentally.

03:17.447 --> 03:23.192
Do not forget that you hold
the key to the fate of the Earth.

03:23.287 --> 03:25.323
Believe in your own power.

03:25.414 --> 03:29.908
And learn for yourself an effective
way to bring forth that power.

03:30.002 --> 03:31.993
But I...

03:32.087 --> 03:33.122
Bye now.

03:33.213 --> 03:38.799
Wait! Where is my food? My bath? My bed?

03:38.886 --> 03:44.256
You think that stuff has been
prepared for you, sweet prince?

03:44.349 --> 03:46.965
If you have to blame something,
blame your own fate.

03:47.060 --> 03:49.016
Like I do.

03:54.568 --> 03:56.524
Wait!

03:56.612 --> 04:01.231
I'm scared! Don't leave me!

04:21.637 --> 04:25.505
Kami-sama, acting strange. Something wrong?

04:28.644 --> 04:32.637
Piccolo really is different
than he was before, somehow.

04:32.731 --> 04:34.437
There's no doubt he's still evil,

04:34.524 --> 04:37.311
but it feels like he's lost some of that

04:37.402 --> 04:40.064
wily coarseness he had long ago.

04:40.155 --> 04:46.071
Popo think so too. Old Daimao not
make Son Goku's son stronger.

04:46.161 --> 04:49.494
What made me clearly realize that
there is something odd about Piccolo

04:49.581 --> 04:54.826
is that when Son Goku's brother,
Raditz, was killed by him,

04:54.920 --> 04:58.037
his soul went straight to the Next World.

05:09.768 --> 05:13.352
Up until now, the souls of those
killed by a demon clansman

05:13.438 --> 05:14.769
did not cross over,

05:14.856 --> 05:19.600
and just suffered as they drifted
between heaven and Earth.

05:19.695 --> 05:22.983
And yet, since Raditz went to the Next World,

05:23.073 --> 05:26.406
this is clearly not the Piccolo of old.

05:28.245 --> 05:32.033
Piccolo now has good heart?

05:32.124 --> 05:34.365
Perhaps he has become aware

05:34.459 --> 05:40.625
that my life, and thus Piccolo's life,
has only one year left.

05:42.426 --> 05:45.384
One year...?

05:45.470 --> 05:49.008
Whether that's because Piccolo
will be killed by the Saiyans

05:49.099 --> 05:51.806
who will be here in one year,

05:51.893 --> 05:58.605
or because my lifespan will run out
around that time, I don't know.

05:58.692 --> 06:01.900
My death will mean Piccolo's death,

06:01.987 --> 06:05.696
and Piccolo's death will mean my death.

06:08.452 --> 06:14.448
Though I may be Kami, it's unpleasant
knowing when I'm going to die.

06:14.541 --> 06:17.283
He must sense it, too.

06:17.377 --> 06:20.289
He must want to leave something behind,

06:20.380 --> 06:23.998
even if it is to Son Goku's son.

06:24.092 --> 06:27.050
Then, Dragon Balls can only be used...

06:27.137 --> 06:30.846
Mm-hmm. The next time will be the last one.

06:32.225 --> 06:37.345
To think that Gohan was
that strong! I had no idea at all.

06:37.439 --> 06:39.851
He is my child, all right!

06:46.073 --> 06:50.362
That's right! Nothing says I have
to walk along the road, huh?

06:50.452 --> 06:51.988
All right...

07:00.921 --> 07:03.708
I'll get there in no time like this!

07:08.553 --> 07:10.635
Yow-ow-ow-ow!

07:32.828 --> 07:33.988
That was close, that was close!

07:34.079 --> 07:36.695
That's Hell down beneath the clouds.

07:57.310 --> 08:02.054
Help! Somebody, help!

08:38.977 --> 08:42.014
I can't get down!

08:46.943 --> 08:49.025
Crap!

08:49.112 --> 08:53.151
That guide said that once I
was dead, I wouldn't get hungry,

08:53.241 --> 08:55.618
but here I am, famished!

09:00.498 --> 09:02.784
What? You couldn't tell them?

09:02.876 --> 09:05.413
I'm very sorry.

09:07.672 --> 09:09.833
You mean, not any of it?

09:09.925 --> 09:11.165
No...

09:11.259 --> 09:15.719
You're hopeless. Geez, you've got no spine.

09:15.805 --> 09:18.012
That's easy for you to say.

09:18.099 --> 09:22.388
If you saw Chichi-san's face,
you couldn't tell her that Goku died.

09:22.479 --> 09:24.936
Well, I can't blame you.

09:25.023 --> 09:26.729
But unless we do something...

09:26.816 --> 09:28.727
If we write her a letter
explaining the situation,

09:28.818 --> 09:31.855
she might understand, right?

09:31.947 --> 09:34.689
Yes, you're right! That's a good idea!

09:34.783 --> 09:38.241
By the way, Kuririn,
what about the Dragon Balls?

09:38.328 --> 09:41.411
There were two of them
at Son-kun's house, right?

09:42.958 --> 09:44.118
| forgot.

09:44.209 --> 09:46.040
You good-for-nothing!

09:55.178 --> 09:58.295
I'm scared! l'm cold!

09:58.390 --> 10:02.303
I'm hungry! I'm going to die!

10:10.568 --> 10:15.062
Apples! Some apples
have fallen here! Lucky me!

10:22.789 --> 10:24.495
Oh, well.

10:30.797 --> 10:34.335
It's sour! Yuck!

10:38.805 --> 10:43.299
I want Chinese buns!
I want shaomai dumplings!

10:43.393 --> 10:46.931
You dirty brat, making me take care of you!

10:58.074 --> 11:02.613
I'm scared... I'm scared...

11:02.704 --> 11:07.368
Mind you, this is the last time I help you out.

11:11.629 --> 11:14.962
then that's all you were
ever going to amount to.

11:42.118 --> 11:44.655
Too bright!

11:58.885 --> 12:01.001
I can't get down!

12:01.096 --> 12:04.054
I'm hungry!

12:04.140 --> 12:06.756
I'm scared!

12:06.851 --> 12:08.637
If you're hungry, you could
come down from there

12:08.728 --> 12:10.969
and look for something to eat.

12:14.109 --> 12:17.897
And after I told him, "Make sure you
come home before nightfall," too!

12:17.987 --> 12:21.024
It's been a long time since
Goku's visited the Kame House.

12:21.116 --> 12:23.528
He just got wrapped up in
talkin' about the good old days

12:23.618 --> 12:25.609
and lost track of time.

12:25.703 --> 12:27.910
That may be fine and all for Goku-sa,

12:27.997 --> 12:29.953
but Gohan has his cram school!

12:30.041 --> 12:33.158
Missin' one day of cram
school isn't that big a deal.

12:33.253 --> 12:34.618
You're too lenient, Pa!

12:34.712 --> 12:35.997
From here on in this world,

12:36.089 --> 12:38.705
it's those that study who come out ahead!

12:45.890 --> 12:47.972
I wonder if that's got it...

12:48.059 --> 12:50.971
Hey, I'm finally done!

12:57.026 --> 12:58.687
You've got some nerve,

12:58.778 --> 13:01.941
kicking back and sleeping at a time like this!

13:03.241 --> 13:07.735
You there, Old Man Turtle, stand up.

13:07.829 --> 13:10.491
O-Old Man Turtle?

13:10.582 --> 13:12.243
I've changed the characters in the display

13:12.333 --> 13:14.289
to make it easier to understand.

13:16.379 --> 13:18.290
Let's see...

13:18.381 --> 13:19.917
139!

13:20.008 --> 13:23.592
139? I'm not that young.

13:23.678 --> 13:27.216
That's the number that represents
your strength, Muten Roshi-sama.

13:27.307 --> 13:30.140
The number that represents my strength?

13:30.226 --> 13:34.014
That's an incredible device, huh?
It can tell you that?

13:34.105 --> 13:37.768
B-Bulma-san, how high am |?

13:41.654 --> 13:44.862
Amazing! It says 206.

13:44.949 --> 13:48.066
I really have surpassed you, Muten Roshi-sama!

13:48.161 --> 13:51.449
H-Hey, are you sure it's not malfunctioning?

13:51.539 --> 13:55.782
--I don't mean to brag, but my skills are...
--Hey!

13:55.877 --> 13:57.162
Hey!

13:57.253 --> 14:00.370
Who is that calling to us in such a strange way?

14:00.465 --> 14:02.922
It's me.

14:03.009 --> 14:05.842
Y-You're that guy who
was at Karin-sama's place...

14:05.929 --> 14:08.215
--Armadillo!
--|t's Yajirobe, ya nincompoop!

14:08.306 --> 14:10.262
Ya screwed up my name on purpose!

14:10.350 --> 14:14.719
Karin asked me to come here
an' deliver a message to ya!

14:14.812 --> 14:16.768
A message from Karin-sama?

14:17.815 --> 14:20.648
"I am aware of the whole situation."

14:20.735 --> 14:24.603
So you, that Yamucha guy,
Ten-somethin'-or-other, and Chaozu

14:24.697 --> 14:26.403
are to go there at once.

14:26.491 --> 14:28.903
Huh? All of us, go to Karin Tower?

14:28.993 --> 14:30.199
Why?

14:30.286 --> 14:34.279
Kami-sama, ya see, says he's
gonna be givin' us trainin'.

14:34.374 --> 14:35.659
I'm in on this, too.

14:35.750 --> 14:37.160
R-Really?!

14:37.252 --> 14:40.210
Yeah. I told 'im, I ain't up for fightin' them

14:40.296 --> 14:45.461
whatchamacall'em aliens,
but he says I gotta do it, or else.

14:45.552 --> 14:47.167
I've had it.

14:47.262 --> 14:50.925
A-All right. I'll go find them all,
and come, right away.

14:51.015 --> 14:53.882
Bye, then. Can't say I didn't tell ya.

14:55.103 --> 14:58.311
Oh, yeah. Forgot somethin'.

14:58.398 --> 15:02.607
Goku says not to bring 'im back
to life 'til them enemies get here.

15:02.694 --> 15:04.400
Huh? W-Why not?

15:04.487 --> 15:07.320
Word is he's gonna train
there in the Other World.

15:07.407 --> 15:11.867
Some old lady named Uranai
Baba'll be comin' by shortly,

15:11.953 --> 15:13.784
an' you can ask her all the details.

15:15.540 --> 15:18.156
W-What? When?

15:20.169 --> 15:22.626
T-Training in the Other World?

15:22.714 --> 15:24.579
W-What the...?

15:26.426 --> 15:27.461
Huh?

15:27.552 --> 15:29.793
He's coming back again.

15:34.809 --> 15:39.803
Ahoy, Muten Roshi-sama!

15:39.897 --> 15:41.888
It's Chichi and Gyumao!

15:46.029 --> 15:48.862
Muten Roshi-sama, what do we do?

15:50.325 --> 15:53.567
I haven't written that letter yet.

15:54.787 --> 15:57.529
Muten Roshi-sama!

15:57.624 --> 16:01.993
It has been too long! Have you been well?

16:02.086 --> 16:04.998
Er, um, l-l suppose...

16:05.089 --> 16:08.627
My Goku-sa and Gohan
are supposed to be here.

16:08.718 --> 16:10.299
Where are they?

16:10.386 --> 16:13.924
U-Um, t-the truth is...

16:15.058 --> 16:17.140
Mumble, mumble, mumble...

16:19.145 --> 16:22.603
He's been taken away by Piccolo Daimao?!

16:22.690 --> 16:25.477
W-What happened to G-G-Goku?!

16:25.568 --> 16:28.435
H-He's dead.

16:33.451 --> 16:36.943
Chichi! Buck up!

16:57.350 --> 17:01.059
How did something like this happen to me?

17:02.772 --> 17:04.308
Huh?

17:05.483 --> 17:10.021
I wonder why it's so light out.

17:10.113 --> 17:15.528
Ah, it's the moon! Wow, it's completely round!

17:15.617 --> 17:19.906
This is the first time I've ever seen a full m--

17:27.755 --> 17:29.291
What?!

18:14.719 --> 18:16.459
What?!

18:47.877 --> 18:51.870
At this rate, Earth will be destroyed
before the Saiyans even get here!

18:54.509 --> 18:56.625
W-What's going on here?!

18:59.680 --> 19:03.548
Don't play dumb!
It's when the moon becomes full

19:03.643 --> 19:07.261
that we Saiyans really start
hitting our stride, you know!

19:08.314 --> 19:10.430
That's it!

19:10.525 --> 19:12.231
The full moon!

19:15.238 --> 19:17.194
Get lost!

19:55.987 --> 19:58.774
I-I never imagined he would transform.

19:58.865 --> 20:01.356
Is it his Saiyan blood?

20:01.450 --> 20:03.406
I think I'm starting to understand the secret

20:03.494 --> 20:06.110
behind his and Son Goku's power.

20:06.205 --> 20:09.868
It looks like blowing the moon
away was the right answer.

20:11.460 --> 20:13.200
It makes me shudder,

20:13.296 --> 20:18.336
thinking that the Saiyans might
turn into monsters like that.

20:18.426 --> 20:21.634
He said something about their tails, too.

20:21.721 --> 20:25.509
Apparently, to transform,
they need their tails and the full moon.

20:25.600 --> 20:27.306
I guess I'll pull out his tail.

20:27.393 --> 20:30.726
Not that I have to worry about it anymore now,

20:30.813 --> 20:34.476
but their tails seem to be
the Saiyan's weakness.

20:37.194 --> 20:38.934
There.

20:39.030 --> 20:41.646
I suppose I can provide you
with clothes and a sword, at least.

20:41.741 --> 20:44.824
I'll make it the same design as your old man's.

20:51.542 --> 20:53.282
The character on it will be different, though.

20:56.047 --> 20:59.915
I have to go attend to my
own training, so I'm leaving.

21:00.009 --> 21:04.002
If you can survive here safely for six months,

21:04.096 --> 21:07.964
I, Piccolo, will personally put
you through special training hell.

21:08.059 --> 21:11.597
So much so, you'll wish you had died.

21:11.687 --> 21:13.427
Brace yourself for it.

21:15.107 --> 21:18.941
I'm going to turn you into
a fine demon clansman!

21:21.364 --> 21:23.650
To defeat the Saiyans,

21:23.741 --> 21:27.359
the harsh trials that father
and son are being subjected to

21:27.453 --> 21:29.990
continue on and on.

21:31.916 --> 21:34.828
Yeah! Break! Care! Break! As hard as you can

21:34.919 --> 21:39.413
Fly away into the boundless skies

21:39.507 --> 21:42.340
We'll hitch a ride on the jet stream,

21:42.426 --> 21:45.463
and zip away to wherever we want

21:45.554 --> 21:47.806
Being a daredevil is the best

21:47.890 --> 21:51.223
Let's go tip-top! All right?

21:51.310 --> 21:57.101
This eye-opening blue Earth of ours

21:57.191 --> 22:03.278
is our irreplaceable world,
and we're not giving it up

22:04.657 --> 22:07.615
Blast offa Kamehame-Ha

22:07.702 --> 22:10.865
You were born

22:10.955 --> 22:16.575
to protect the world in these uncertain times

22:16.669 --> 22:19.581
Yeah! Break! Care! Break! As hard as you can

22:19.672 --> 22:22.789
Go at it full power

22:22.883 --> 22:26.842
Hope is my weapon,

22:26.929 --> 22:30.171
so believe in the future

22:34.311 --> 22:35.642
Heya! I'm Goku!

22:35.730 --> 22:38.312
Hooray! I can see the serpent's tail!

22:38.399 --> 22:42.017
As big a snake ["hebi"] as it is,
it sure is heavy ["hebii"]!

22:43.738 --> 22:46.571
What have you come up ["kite'n kai"]
to the Heavenly Realm ["tenkai"] for?

22:46.657 --> 22:48.272
That one was great!

22:48.367 --> 22:51.359
By any chance, are you Kaio-sama?

22:51.454 --> 22:53.240
Next time on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

22:53.330 --> 22:56.822
"The End of the Line is Reached!
Kaio-sama's Playful Trials. ”

22:56.917 --> 22:59.875
Father, I've gotten stronger.
