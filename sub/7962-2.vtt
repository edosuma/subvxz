00:03.896 --> 00:05.128
FRANK:<i> Charlie,</i>
<i> can I come in already?</i>

00:05.130 --> 00:06.563
CHARLIE:
<i> Well, that depends, Frank.</i>

00:06.565 --> 00:08.398
<i> Are you done farting? </i>
FRANK:<i> No.</i>

00:08.400 --> 00:10.567
Well, then you're gonna keep
hanging your ass out the window

00:10.569 --> 00:11.568
till you're
done, all right?

00:11.570 --> 00:13.470
Look, I-I warned you.

00:13.472 --> 00:15.105
You want to put slices of
rum ham on a Grilled Charlie?

00:15.107 --> 00:16.139
That's a stomach bomb.

00:16.141 --> 00:17.240
It's too much for your system.

00:17.242 --> 00:18.909
Then make me
another one.

00:18.911 --> 00:20.744
If I'm gonna stick my ass out
the window, I'm gonna eat.

00:20.746 --> 00:22.579
Unbelievable.
All right, here we go.

00:22.581 --> 00:24.114
I feel like it's gonna be a week

00:24.116 --> 00:25.582
before your system
gets back to normal.

00:25.584 --> 00:26.583
Y-You can't just
eat whatever you...

00:26.585 --> 00:27.985
Charlie...!

00:27.987 --> 00:29.653
(crashing, shattering)

00:29.655 --> 00:31.421
Holy shit!

00:31.423 --> 00:32.456
Are you okay?!

00:32.458 --> 00:34.124
(grunting)

00:34.126 --> 00:36.593
Frank?!

00:36.595 --> 00:37.761
Hey, are you all right?

00:37.763 --> 00:39.329
(groans)

00:39.331 --> 00:41.431
(echoing):
Hey! Are you okay?

00:41.433 --> 00:42.966
(groans)

00:42.968 --> 00:44.668
(echoing):
Are you all right, man?

00:44.670 --> 00:46.670
Frank!

00:46.672 --> 00:48.372
Where are you going?!

01:12.698 --> 01:13.997
MAC:
<i> But I'm the one that</i>

01:13.999 --> 01:15.465
came up with the chickens
to contaminate the steaks.

01:15.467 --> 01:17.334
I was the first one
to say that, right?

01:17.336 --> 01:18.802
I-I don't think so, no.

01:18.804 --> 01:20.804
I don't think so.
You t... Are
you serious?

01:20.806 --> 01:22.806
No, I remember being
on the phone and...
Yeah, being totally serious.

01:22.808 --> 01:25.142
Dennis, Deandra!

01:25.144 --> 01:26.643
Yeah.
Uh...
What?

01:26.645 --> 01:28.011
No, I-I...
I-I feel like
I came up with it.

01:28.013 --> 01:29.312
It's me!

01:29.314 --> 01:30.380
What, do you want
a goddamn medal?

01:30.382 --> 01:31.982
Yeah, get out
of here, Frank.

01:31.984 --> 01:33.350
We're right in the middle
of something very important.

01:33.352 --> 01:34.985
I was on the phone;
I came up with it.

01:34.987 --> 01:36.319
What are you talking about?
That never happened...

01:36.321 --> 01:37.988
Your mother's dead.

01:37.990 --> 01:39.656
I thought I was the one that...
Yeah, we know she's dead.

01:39.658 --> 01:42.325
I think I was the one
that told you to make that call.

01:42.327 --> 01:43.693
I-I was just kidding.

01:43.695 --> 01:46.163
Uh, your mother's
not really dead.

01:46.165 --> 01:49.900
Uh, I dropped that bomb
to soften the blow.

01:50.836 --> 01:52.335
We're getting divorced.

01:52.337 --> 01:53.336
Wh-What's happening?

01:53.338 --> 01:54.504
Are you doing
a bit, Frank?

01:54.506 --> 01:55.505
You're not a funny guy.
It's not funny.

01:55.507 --> 01:56.506
Don't do bits.
They never play.

01:56.508 --> 01:57.908
Hey! Hey!

01:57.910 --> 02:00.177
Oh, shit, man,
are you okay?

02:00.179 --> 02:01.344
And who might you be?

02:01.346 --> 02:02.512
Wh-What?!

02:02.514 --> 02:03.914
Uh-oh,
he's finally lost it.

02:03.916 --> 02:05.182
Should we toss him
in a home?

02:05.184 --> 02:06.183
Yep.
I-I'll get the car.

02:06.185 --> 02:07.184
N-N-No, guys, guys.

02:07.186 --> 02:08.552
Frank fell
out my window.

02:08.554 --> 02:10.353
We had our, like,
fire escape taken off,

02:10.355 --> 02:12.556
and, dude, you, like, must
have hit your head real hard.

02:12.558 --> 02:15.559
(scoffs) Look, you seem
like a really nice kid,

02:15.561 --> 02:17.861
but my head is fine.

02:17.863 --> 02:19.396
Oh, my God!
(gasps)
Oh, shit!

02:19.398 --> 02:20.864
MAC: Oh, my God.
That's horrific!

02:20.866 --> 02:22.699
Oh, I see skull!

02:22.701 --> 02:24.034
CHARLIE:
Uh, okay, Frank.

02:24.036 --> 02:26.036
Um, what day is it?
Wednesday.

02:26.038 --> 02:27.704
Yes.
Wrong, it's Tuesday.

02:27.706 --> 02:29.706
Is it?
Actually, no,
it's-it's Wednesday.

02:29.708 --> 02:31.541
Yeah, he's right.
Did I lose a day?

02:31.543 --> 02:33.543
Yeah.
Okay, you know
what? I got one.

02:33.545 --> 02:35.912
Um, what is the capital
of Pennsylvania?
Philadelphia.

02:35.914 --> 02:37.747
Yes. No.
I don't think
that's right.

02:37.749 --> 02:39.216
Uh, is it Pittsburgh?

02:39.218 --> 02:40.884
Uh, at one point,
it was Philly.

02:40.886 --> 02:42.619
I'm pretty sure.
I don't think
they change it, Charlie.

02:42.621 --> 02:45.388
MAC: All right, let's just,
let's ask something easier.

02:45.390 --> 02:47.124
Who's the President
of the United States?

02:47.126 --> 02:48.492
George Bush.

02:49.628 --> 02:51.461
Nah, I was just kidding.

02:51.463 --> 02:53.897
The real president of the
United States is Dick Cheney.

02:53.899 --> 02:55.732
He's pulling
all the strings.

02:55.734 --> 02:57.634
Ah, shit, Frank,
what year do you think it is?

02:57.636 --> 02:59.669
2006.

03:01.907 --> 03:03.240
Oh, man.
Whoa.
Well, okay,

03:03.242 --> 03:04.407
so something clearly
happened to Frank

03:04.409 --> 03:06.243
when he fell out
of that window.

03:06.245 --> 03:08.245
I think what happened is
he went through the window,

03:08.247 --> 03:12.782
and the window seemed to be some
sort of portal to the year 2006.

03:12.784 --> 03:13.950
He has a concussion.

03:13.952 --> 03:15.418
It's not 2006.

03:15.420 --> 03:17.587
It's crazy, but stranger
things have happened.

03:17.589 --> 03:19.322
No, they haven't.
No, they haven't.
DENNIS: A-A-All right.

03:19.324 --> 03:21.091
Guys, guys, guys.

03:21.093 --> 03:22.926
You remember ten years ago
when Frank first came back,

03:22.928 --> 03:24.761
and he wanted to, like, give
all his money away to charity

03:24.763 --> 03:26.329
and reconnect
with his kids and shit?

03:26.331 --> 03:27.831
Right, then he started hanging
out with Mac and Charlie,

03:27.833 --> 03:29.099
got a taste
of the bar lifestyle

03:29.101 --> 03:30.634
and decided he'd rather
live in squalor.

03:30.636 --> 03:34.771
Guys, we have an opportunity
to change history.

03:34.773 --> 03:37.107
Are you talking about taking all
his money and kicking him out?

03:37.109 --> 03:38.608
Of course that's what
I'm talking about.

03:38.610 --> 03:39.609
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I want to do that.

03:39.611 --> 03:40.844
I-I want to do that.
I'm in. Yeah, yeah.

03:40.846 --> 03:42.112
We got to come up
with a plan here.

03:42.114 --> 03:43.980
What if Charlie and I take Frank

03:43.982 --> 03:47.617
to the strip club, like before,
so he keeps thinking it's 2006?

03:47.619 --> 03:49.452
We can't repeat the same
mistakes of the past.

03:49.454 --> 03:50.787
'Cause that might
trigger his memories.

03:50.789 --> 03:52.155
In fact, keep Charlie
away from Frank.

03:52.157 --> 03:53.290
I mean, he's drawn to him

03:53.292 --> 03:54.291
for some inexplicable reason.

03:54.293 --> 03:55.659
Dee, here's what we'll do.

03:55.661 --> 03:57.194
You and I will
actually reconnect

03:57.196 --> 03:59.129
with Frank this time
instead of rejecting him.

03:59.131 --> 04:00.797
Okay, we just got to figure out
a way to get him

04:00.799 --> 04:01.798
to write us
a check for that money.

04:01.800 --> 04:02.966
You know what
we could do is

04:02.968 --> 04:04.167
we could do, like,
a Wyclef Jean thing

04:04.169 --> 04:05.669
and create
a charity for Haiti

04:05.671 --> 04:07.370
and then allegedly keep
all the money for ourselves.

04:07.372 --> 04:09.206
By the time he figures out
what the hell's going on...

04:54.386 --> 04:55.752
Uh, life's good, man.

04:55.754 --> 04:57.187
Things have been,
uh, pretty good.

04:57.189 --> 04:58.255
I'm still working towards
becoming a veterinarian.

04:58.257 --> 04:59.256
Of course.
Mm-hmm.

04:59.258 --> 05:00.690
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, yeah.

05:00.692 --> 05:01.925
And I'm still working
toward my dreams

05:01.927 --> 05:03.760
of becoming a
Broadway star.

05:03.762 --> 05:07.030
Getting close, but just haven't
quite found my traction.

05:07.032 --> 05:08.398
Right.
FRANK:
That's okay.

05:08.400 --> 05:09.866
You got time.
DEE: Yeah.

05:09.868 --> 05:11.234
Youse are young.

05:11.236 --> 05:13.203
You're what, 25, 26?

05:13.205 --> 05:14.938
Yeah.

05:14.940 --> 05:16.940
Eh, give it a
few more years.

05:16.942 --> 05:19.876
If it doesn't work
out, you move on.
(chuckles)
Mm-hmm.

05:19.878 --> 05:22.545
I mean, y-you don't want to be
almost 40 working at a bar.

05:22.547 --> 05:23.780
Right.
Nope.

05:23.782 --> 05:25.048
No way.

05:25.050 --> 05:27.050
I know that I've
been a lousy dad,

05:27.052 --> 05:29.052
but there's only one
person to blame for that:

05:29.054 --> 05:30.553
your whore mother.

05:30.555 --> 05:32.055
Mm.
I don't like who
she turned me into.

05:32.057 --> 05:35.458
The big house,
the big car.

05:35.460 --> 05:37.894
I'm giving it all away.

05:37.896 --> 05:39.262
To charity.

05:39.264 --> 05:43.300
Well, that is
a great idea.

05:43.302 --> 05:45.235
I thought you'd give me
a lot of shit for that.

05:45.237 --> 05:47.070
Oh, no.
Man, who do you
think we are?

05:47.072 --> 05:49.639
Oh, my gosh.
No, we are super
into helping people in need

05:49.641 --> 05:51.141

Yeah. Y-Y-Yeah, y-yeah.

05:51.143 --> 05:53.443

work very closely

05:53.445 --> 05:54.911
with a charity that,
uh, that offers relief

05:54.913 --> 05:56.146
for the Haiti disaster.

05:56.148 --> 05:57.981
There was a
disaster in Haiti?

05:57.983 --> 05:59.983

My phone?

06:09.127 --> 06:10.593
That's a phone?!

06:10.595 --> 06:12.329
I've never seen anything
like it in my life.

06:12.331 --> 06:16.099
That's because...
I invented it.

06:16.101 --> 06:17.133
You invented that?

06:17.135 --> 06:18.168
Yep.

06:18.170 --> 06:19.302
That is genius!

06:19.304 --> 06:21.104
Isn't it?

06:21.106 --> 06:23.473
Dennis, I always thought you'd
be the one to move out in front.

06:23.475 --> 06:24.941
No, it was her,
but it was her after me,

06:24.943 --> 06:26.943
because, um, she actually
came up with that

06:26.945 --> 06:29.112
after I had already
invented this.

06:29.114 --> 06:31.448
You invented that?

06:31.450 --> 06:33.450
Yeah, I invented this first,
and then she copied me.

06:33.452 --> 06:34.784
Well, you know what
I did? I upgraded it.

06:34.786 --> 06:36.186
I made it better.
Oh.

06:36.188 --> 06:37.787

that you were gonna

we came here with Frank,

07:03.382 --> 07:05.181
we brought home two
strippers, so...

Yeah, but he banged

07:17.062 --> 07:19.662
Huh?
You're not...

07:19.664 --> 07:21.898
You haven't become...
Just drop it,
just drop it, just drop it.

07:21.900 --> 07:24.367
Yeah, I-I'll drop it.
Hey!

07:24.369 --> 07:26.403
Frankie, what's up, man?
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
What are you doing here?

07:26.405 --> 07:28.004
I thought you were out
with your kids.

07:28.006 --> 07:29.672
You mind if I sit down?
Yeah, absolutely not.

07:29.674 --> 07:31.007
Pop a squat, Frankie!
All right!

07:31.009 --> 07:32.041
Goddamn it, I-I...

07:32.043 --> 07:33.877
Oh, my God.

07:33.879 --> 07:35.345
You poor baby.

07:35.347 --> 07:36.713
What happened
to your head?

07:36.715 --> 07:38.181
Ooh.

07:38.183 --> 07:39.549
Eh, it's nothing--
just a little scratch.

07:39.551 --> 07:40.917
STRIPPER:
No, it looks infected.

07:40.919 --> 07:42.519
FRANK:
It does?

07:42.521 --> 07:44.487
Maybe give you
a lap dance?

07:46.925 --> 07:49.092
(laughing, chattering)

07:49.094 --> 07:50.927
Whoa.

07:50.929 --> 07:53.430
Make yourself at home!
Welcome to<i> mi casa.</i>

07:53.432 --> 07:56.199
You got any booze?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah-- in
the bed, under the pillow.

07:56.201 --> 07:57.200
Oh, oh.
Oh, gosh.

07:57.202 --> 07:59.369
I love it;
it's so spacious.

07:59.371 --> 08:00.937
It's one goddamn room.

08:00.939 --> 08:02.906
You have a steak knife
in your bed.

08:02.908 --> 08:04.741
Oh, well, that's
Frank's, uh...

08:04.743 --> 08:07.610
Um, that is my toe knife.

08:07.612 --> 08:08.711
It's your what?

08:08.713 --> 08:10.547
Uh, that's my
t-toe knife.

08:10.549 --> 08:13.383
For, you know, digging
the scum out of my toes...

08:13.385 --> 08:15.718
It's disgusting, disgusting.
...and cutting my nails off.

08:15.720 --> 08:17.720
Y-You cut your toenails
with a knife?

08:17.722 --> 08:19.122
Yeah. Well, yeah.
He does.

08:19.124 --> 08:20.123
I mean, it's, uh...
Gross.

08:20.125 --> 08:21.624
...a cleaner cut, really.

08:23.595 --> 08:25.462
...scum out of my toenail.

08:25.464 --> 08:27.230
Oh, botched toe!

08:27.232 --> 08:28.398
Frank, that is disgusting!

08:28.400 --> 08:30.800
FRANK (echoing):
<i> Toe knife.</i>

08:30.802 --> 08:32.902
Maybe I ought to try that.

08:32.904 --> 08:34.971
I don't think you should.
Can I talk to you outside

08:34.973 --> 08:36.739
for a second?
Just one second. Thank you.
All right, all right.

08:36.741 --> 08:39.108
Man.
Dude, we have to stop
what's going on in there.

08:39.110 --> 08:40.944
Why? We're about to bang
a couple strippers.

08:40.946 --> 08:42.412
Don't you see?
We're making the same mistakes

08:42.414 --> 08:43.646
that we made
with Frank years ago.

08:43.648 --> 08:45.081
Don't you understand?

08:45.083 --> 08:46.950
He is on a bang path
straight to the waitress.

08:46.952 --> 08:49.419
Oh, shit. All right,
definitely want to avoid that.

08:49.421 --> 08:50.587
All right,
let's pull him.

08:50.589 --> 08:52.055
Okay, yeah.
Let's pull him out.

08:53.992 --> 08:54.991
He locked us out.

08:54.993 --> 08:56.426
He did?
Yes.

08:56.428 --> 08:58.495
So it<i> is</i> 2006.

09:04.970 --> 09:07.604
♪ I'll be gone till November,
I'll be gone till November ♪

09:07.606 --> 09:09.305
♪ Yo, tell my girl
I'll be gone till November... ♪

09:09.307 --> 09:11.307
You know what,
say what you want about Wyclef;

09:11.309 --> 09:13.142
he may have stolen money
from his own people,

09:13.144 --> 09:14.944
but that man can write
a goddamn song.
Oh, nice.

09:14.946 --> 09:16.446
Right?
He's an excellent
songwriter.

09:16.448 --> 09:17.780
And that is an
excellent song.

09:17.782 --> 09:19.282
Mm-hmm.
But, Dee, Dee, look.

09:19.284 --> 09:20.850
I want to talk to you
about something, okay?

09:20.852 --> 09:22.819
We have a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity here.
Yes.

09:22.821 --> 09:24.821
We have a real
second chance.
I know.

09:24.823 --> 09:26.823
S-So I want to talk to
you about our future.
Yes.

09:26.825 --> 09:28.625
Can we get into it?
Yes.

09:28.627 --> 09:29.792
All right, here, sit
down for a second.
Okay.

09:29.794 --> 09:31.327
'Cause in order
to do that,

09:31.329 --> 09:32.795
I think we're gonna
have to get real.
Okay.

09:32.797 --> 09:35.031
And I want to get very
real with you right now.

09:35.033 --> 09:36.966
Yeah, go ahead.
Can I do that? Because I feel
like I'm almost coddling you.

09:36.968 --> 09:39.202
Interesting.
But that's neither
here nor there.

09:39.204 --> 09:41.538
I just want to get real with
you f-for a second, okay?
Yeah, go ahead.

09:41.540 --> 09:42.639
So the acting thing.

09:42.641 --> 09:43.806
Mm-hmm.
It's done.

09:43.808 --> 09:45.975
But it's been done
for a long time.

09:45.977 --> 09:47.977
I mean, you were
too old in 2006.

09:47.979 --> 09:49.512
You're way too old now.

09:49.514 --> 09:52.115
And you're bad at it.

09:54.986 --> 09:56.886
Thank you.

09:56.888 --> 09:58.855
For your honesty.
Yeah, is it...
are you cool?

09:58.857 --> 10:01.324
Oh, so much do I appreciate
you for that.
Thank you.

10:01.326 --> 10:02.692
Okay, good.
That must have
been hard for you.

10:02.694 --> 10:03.993
It was.
To say.

10:03.995 --> 10:05.995
Can I be honest with you?
I-I need you to.

10:05.997 --> 10:07.363
Right?
Right.

10:07.365 --> 10:09.699
Okay, so the
veterinarian thing.
Yeah.

10:09.701 --> 10:12.535
I feel like the only reason
you wanted to be a vet

10:12.537 --> 10:14.237
was to keep the skins.

10:14.239 --> 10:16.339
What?

10:16.341 --> 10:17.840
You want to keep
the skins, don't you?

10:17.842 --> 10:20.843
There's no denying the
skins are fascinating.

10:20.845 --> 10:22.679
It's the most fascinating
part of the animal.

10:22.681 --> 10:24.514
The skin of any animal is
the most fascinating part,

10:24.516 --> 10:26.049
but that's not why
I wanted to become...

10:26.051 --> 10:28.351
Also you're going bald.
I'm going bald?!

10:28.353 --> 10:30.687
What are you
talking about?!
Just in...
in the interest of being real.

10:30.689 --> 10:33.690
Where in the hell am I
possibly going bald?!
In the back of your head...

10:33.692 --> 10:35.024
There's no evidence of that.
There's quite a bit of ev...

10:35.026 --> 10:36.859
I'll get two mirrors;
I'll show it to you.

10:36.861 --> 10:38.728
Don't get mirrors, because...
You're not gonna find anything.

10:38.730 --> 10:40.196
I see fat spilling
over the back of your pants

10:40.198 --> 10:41.531
on a pretty regular basis.
(stammers)

10:41.533 --> 10:42.699
What the hell are
you talking about?!

10:42.701 --> 10:44.367
I'm just trying
to let you know.

10:44.369 --> 10:45.735
And by the way,
there's no reason

10:45.737 --> 10:47.370
why a bald man
who enjoys skins

10:47.372 --> 10:49.038
who has a little bit of
extra something-something

10:49.040 --> 10:50.707
around his belly can't be
a goddamn veterinarian!

10:50.709 --> 10:52.875
Okay, you know what, I can act!
You are a wrinkled bitch!

10:52.877 --> 10:54.410
I'm gonna tell you something,
my characters are good.

10:54.412 --> 10:55.712
Okay, let's stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop, stop.

10:55.714 --> 10:57.914
I-I don't want to do
this with you, okay?

10:57.916 --> 10:59.549
Do you see what's
happening? We're...

10:59.551 --> 11:01.584
We just jumped right back in;
we just leapt right back in.

11:01.586 --> 11:02.919
Into our old routines.
Same old place.

11:02.921 --> 11:04.087
And I-I don't want
to do that, okay?

11:04.089 --> 11:06.222
'Cause... Let's
just focus here.

11:06.224 --> 11:07.724
Here's what
we're gonna do.

11:07.726 --> 11:09.392
We're gonna polish
off this wine.
Yeah.

11:09.394 --> 11:10.960
And then we're gonna open
up a new bottle of vino.

11:10.962 --> 11:12.261
Ooh.
(chuckles)

11:12.263 --> 11:14.263
And let's talk about
our real futures.

11:14.265 --> 11:15.732
♪ I'll be gone
till November... ♪

11:15.734 --> 11:17.734
To new beginnings.

11:17.736 --> 11:19.569
♪ And tell my girl, yo,
I'll be gone till... ♪

11:19.571 --> 11:21.204
(alarm rings)

11:27.245 --> 11:29.245
(groans)

11:29.247 --> 11:31.614
Dennis.

11:31.616 --> 11:33.449
Dennis, wake up.

11:33.451 --> 11:34.450
Aah.

11:34.452 --> 11:36.452
(groans)

11:36.454 --> 11:39.288
I'm up, I'm up,
I'm up.

11:39.290 --> 11:41.290
Look what we did.

11:41.292 --> 11:43.359
(groans)

11:46.131 --> 11:47.497
Is that a crack pipe?

11:47.499 --> 11:48.665
Yes.

11:48.667 --> 11:50.099
No, no.
(groaning):
No.

11:50.101 --> 11:52.502
No, no, no.

11:52.504 --> 11:55.338
How'd this happen again?

11:55.340 --> 11:57.173
(groans)

11:57.175 --> 12:00.176
Well, it looks like we drank
everything in the entire world,

12:00.178 --> 12:03.179
and then we went out
and bought some crack,

12:03.181 --> 12:04.280
and we smoked it.

12:04.282 --> 12:05.682
Yeah, a-a-all right,
that's fine.

12:05.684 --> 12:08.117
No, n-no, we just,
we... we slipped up.

12:08.119 --> 12:09.285
It's-it's not a big deal.

12:09.287 --> 12:10.453
Like, we'll... you know,

12:10.455 --> 12:12.288
we'll... pull
ourselves together,

12:12.290 --> 12:13.656
and we'll, you know,
we'll get back on crack.

12:13.658 --> 12:15.658
I mean, on track.

12:15.660 --> 12:18.027
Unless, um,
you have more crack.

12:18.029 --> 12:19.462
No, Dennis, I don't
have more crack.

12:19.464 --> 12:20.863
No one in the
history of crack

12:20.865 --> 12:22.799
has ever woken up in the
morning with more crack.

12:22.801 --> 12:25.168
(sighs) Okay, but if
I'm being honest with you,

12:25.170 --> 12:27.637
if I'm being very, very real,

12:27.639 --> 12:29.639
I need to be high
on crack cocaine right now.

12:29.641 --> 12:31.340
You know what we can do?
I've got a great idea.

12:31.342 --> 12:32.642
Once we get
Frank's money,

12:32.644 --> 12:33.876
we'll just take
all of that money

12:33.878 --> 12:35.344
and put ourselves in rehab,

12:35.346 --> 12:36.312
'cause we're not gonna
stop smoking crack.

12:36.314 --> 12:37.814
It's all
I'm thinking about.

12:37.816 --> 12:39.148
All right, so we just
got to figure out

12:39.150 --> 12:40.183
another way to
get some money.

12:40.185 --> 12:42.752
I have a idea.

12:45.323 --> 12:46.689
Hi.

12:46.691 --> 12:48.524
I'm a recovering
crackhead,

12:48.526 --> 12:51.160
and this is my donkey-brained
sister that I take care of.

12:51.162 --> 12:52.562
(hums)

12:52.564 --> 12:53.863
I'd like some
welfare, please.

12:53.865 --> 12:55.865
You're a recovering
crack addict,

12:55.867 --> 12:58.835
and your sister has...

12:58.837 --> 13:00.670
the brains of a donkey?

13:00.672 --> 13:02.839
Mmm.

13:02.841 --> 13:04.841
We thought that you might
be a little bit skeptical,

13:04.843 --> 13:05.842
so we brought proof.

13:05.844 --> 13:07.276
Dee?

13:11.349 --> 13:16.185
Well, you clearly replaced the
name Frank with the name Dee,

13:16.187 --> 13:19.922
and you crossed out the word
"not" on this document.

13:19.924 --> 13:22.925
Nevertheless, I do not know
what the hell this document is.

13:22.927 --> 13:25.228
Well, that's... that's an
official State's, uh...

13:25.230 --> 13:26.863
I'm gonna go ahead
and stop you.

13:26.865 --> 13:28.865
None of this
matters to me.

13:28.867 --> 13:30.900
So I don't need
the whole song and dance.

13:30.902 --> 13:34.871
If you want welfare...

13:34.873 --> 13:37.707
you'll just have to fill out
a bunch of this paperwork,

13:37.709 --> 13:40.109
'cause I'm done
with this bullshit.

13:41.045 --> 13:42.278
This is good news.

13:42.280 --> 13:43.946
This is great, isn't it?
Oh, yeah.

13:43.948 --> 13:45.281
I mean, times have
really changed.
They have, I know.

13:45.283 --> 13:47.049
You just fill out
the paperwork now.

13:47.051 --> 13:49.085
You don't have to prove
anything, you know what I mean?

13:49.087 --> 13:51.254
You just get the money now.
Obama just gives you
the money; it's great.

13:51.256 --> 13:53.055
There's a lot of paperwork
to fill out, though.
Yeah, could you write faster?

13:53.057 --> 13:54.223
I need some more crack.

13:54.225 --> 13:55.224
I'm starting
to come down pretty hard.

13:55.226 --> 13:56.559
Okay, listen, Dee,

13:56.561 --> 13:57.627
I'm writing as fast
as I can, okay?

13:57.629 --> 13:59.595
I-I also want crack.
Sorry.

13:59.597 --> 14:01.631
I just don't get why we're
coming here to find a roommate.

14:01.633 --> 14:03.466
You know, what about living
with the waitress, too?

14:03.468 --> 14:04.901
The waitress is not going
to live with you.

14:04.903 --> 14:06.569
This is our only
option, okay?

14:06.571 --> 14:08.571
People in the welfare store
are in a pinch, so are you.

14:08.573 --> 14:09.572
Yeah, that's
a good point.

14:09.574 --> 14:10.740
Uh...

14:10.742 --> 14:11.741
Wait.

14:11.743 --> 14:12.742
Is that Dennis and Dee?

14:12.744 --> 14:14.277
Hi.

14:14.279 --> 14:15.645
Hey, guys.

14:15.647 --> 14:17.246
Wh-What are you
doing here?

14:17.248 --> 14:18.447
Yeah, did you get Frank
to write the check?

14:18.449 --> 14:19.782
Dude, we're well on our way.

14:19.784 --> 14:21.417
(chuckles)
Yeah, but in the meantime,

14:21.419 --> 14:22.952
we came here because we need
some money to buy crack.

14:22.954 --> 14:24.287
You guys
are smoking crack again?

14:24.289 --> 14:25.588
It's not a big deal,
because, uh,

14:25.590 --> 14:27.156
as soon as we get
that check from Frank,

14:27.158 --> 14:28.424
we're just gonna zip right off
to a-a rehab program.

14:28.426 --> 14:29.425
Yeah, we'll get in rehab.

14:29.427 --> 14:30.927
You guys are
back on crack,

14:30.929 --> 14:32.929
Frank brought strippers
back to my place,

14:32.931 --> 14:34.764
we're all bumping into each
other at the welfare store,

14:34.766 --> 14:37.099
and yet I'm the only person
who thinks it's 2006.

14:37.101 --> 14:38.467
♪ You, you got what I need... ♪

14:38.469 --> 14:40.303
Oh...
What?

14:40.305 --> 14:41.804
It's him!
It's him, everyone. Shut up.

14:41.806 --> 14:43.973
Oh, it's Frank. Shut up!
Okay? Shh.

14:43.975 --> 14:45.641
Hey, Frank. Daddy.

14:45.643 --> 14:47.844
Daddy!
Yeah.
Hi, how are you?

14:47.846 --> 14:49.946
What's up?

14:49.948 --> 14:52.682
No shit. No shit!

14:52.684 --> 14:54.283
Yes, we will be there
in just a few minutes.

14:54.285 --> 14:56.285
Okay, bye!
What is it, what do you...

14:56.287 --> 14:57.486
Oh, shit,
great news, guys.

14:57.488 --> 14:58.688
Great news.
No problem with the check.

14:58.690 --> 14:59.956
We just gotta meet
with his money man

14:59.958 --> 15:01.190
and he's just gonna
write it to us.

15:01.192 --> 15:02.792
Big fat check for us.
Oh, my God, yes.

15:02.794 --> 15:04.126
We're going to see money man.
Get rid of that!

15:04.128 --> 15:05.628
All right.
Let's go get some crack!

15:05.630 --> 15:07.129
Yeah.
I mean the check.
We're gonna...

15:07.131 --> 15:08.531
Right, yeah.
Get some crack.

15:08.533 --> 15:09.799
(exhales)

15:09.801 --> 15:11.200
Still need a
roommate, right?

15:11.202 --> 15:12.468
Yeah, what about this guy?

15:12.470 --> 15:13.803
Oh, come on, man.

15:13.805 --> 15:15.471
Don't just do
that, you know?

15:15.473 --> 15:17.573
Knew you were gonna do that.
Anyone else. Look at him.

15:23.681 --> 15:25.481
Mr. Reynolds. Lauren Kerwin.
We spoke earlier.

15:25.483 --> 15:28.217
Hello, toots.

15:28.219 --> 15:29.886
Hello.
(Frank cackles)

15:29.888 --> 15:31.888
Yeah, so where's
Jer-Bear?

15:31.890 --> 15:34.123
Mr. Doran?

15:35.226 --> 15:36.826
Oh, um...

15:36.828 --> 15:38.828
he-he passed away.

15:38.830 --> 15:42.298
(laughing)

15:43.501 --> 15:44.734
He passed...

15:44.736 --> 15:46.168
Jerry!

15:46.170 --> 15:48.504
Jerry, come on in here.
Don't give me that.

15:48.506 --> 15:50.506
Make your secretary
pull that bit on us.

15:50.508 --> 15:52.074
Come on, Jerry.

15:52.076 --> 15:54.844
Um, I'm not his secretary
and he's been dead for years.

15:54.846 --> 15:56.078
Really. So...

15:56.080 --> 15:58.848
Uh... well, anyway,

15:58.850 --> 16:01.684
my kids turned me on
to an idea last night.

16:01.686 --> 16:03.552
Yeah.
All right, look, tell 'em
about your invention.

16:03.554 --> 16:05.755
Well, the charity that...
Huh?

16:05.757 --> 16:08.524
Not the... not the charity.
The phone.

16:08.526 --> 16:10.359
The phone.
They're being modest.

16:10.361 --> 16:11.727
Tell her, show her
about the phone.

16:11.729 --> 16:14.430
Show the broad
the phone.

16:20.438 --> 16:22.104
(exhales)

16:24.709 --> 16:26.575
You goddamn bitch!

16:26.577 --> 16:28.711
You wouldn't know a good idea
if it smacked you in a tit!

16:28.713 --> 16:31.447
She's gonna be gone by 2007,
you mark my words!

16:31.449 --> 16:32.782
DENNIS:
She's a stupid...

16:32.784 --> 16:34.216
stupid idiot.
Yes, she's a dumb...

16:34.218 --> 16:35.217
dumb bitch.
A stupid moron.

16:35.219 --> 16:36.585
So, those people
in Haiti.

16:36.587 --> 16:38.054
Now we can help them
with the mon-- your money.

16:38.056 --> 16:40.723
No, no... Haiti?
Haiti's a lost cause.

16:40.725 --> 16:42.558
You might as well sink
that goddamn island.

16:42.560 --> 16:43.960
What are you talking about?
DEE: (gasps)
No, not a lost cause.

16:43.962 --> 16:46.062
No, you said you wanted
to help poor people.

16:46.064 --> 16:47.730
I am gonna help
the poor people.

16:47.732 --> 16:50.132
I'm gonna help you,
because you are my children

16:50.134 --> 16:51.801
and I gotta think
of your future.

16:51.803 --> 16:53.269
W-What?

16:53.271 --> 16:54.737
This is for you.

16:54.739 --> 16:56.973
(gasps)
There you go.

16:56.975 --> 16:58.908
(both inhale sharply)
Oh!

16:58.910 --> 17:00.643
Oh, that's a lot of zeroes!
Oh, Dee...

17:00.645 --> 17:01.978
Yeah, that's a lot of zeroes.

17:01.980 --> 17:03.312
Yeah. We will.
Oh, Daddy, we're gonna do

17:03.314 --> 17:04.647
such good things
with this money.
Yes.

17:04.649 --> 17:05.915
We're gonna help people,
we're gonna invent.

17:05.917 --> 17:07.917
Let's do it now, though.
Let's move.

17:07.919 --> 17:09.251
Yeah, we'll go deposit it.
Invent, invent,
invent, invent, right.

17:09.253 --> 17:10.753
Okay, very good decision.
Thank you!

17:10.755 --> 17:11.988
Do it right away,
do it right away.

17:11.990 --> 17:13.255
(Dee giggles)
You're a great dad.

17:13.257 --> 17:14.256
Oh, Daddy!
You're a great dad.

17:14.258 --> 17:15.358
You're right.

17:16.828 --> 17:19.328
(echoing):
You are crackheads, children.

17:21.299 --> 17:23.499
MAC:<i> I want to thank you,</i>
<i> gentlemen, for your interest</i>

17:23.501 --> 17:25.101
in the roommate
position.

17:25.103 --> 17:26.168
You're both
excellent candidates.

17:26.170 --> 17:27.436
We have Edgar

17:27.438 --> 17:29.338
and Trevor,

17:29.340 --> 17:31.507
who is an aspiring
jazz musician.

17:31.509 --> 17:32.942
That's interesting,

17:32.944 --> 17:35.311
because Charlie is actually
a musician himself.

17:35.313 --> 17:37.680
Mm, don't really care
for jazz, though.

17:37.682 --> 17:39.448
A lot of
unnecessary notes.

17:39.450 --> 17:40.616
(door opens)
FRANK:
Hey!

17:40.618 --> 17:42.952
Got room for one more?

17:42.954 --> 17:44.320
Frank, what are
you doing here?

17:44.322 --> 17:45.621
Charlie, the other night

17:45.623 --> 17:47.023
was the greatest night
of my life.

17:47.025 --> 17:49.492
I used to live like that,
in filth and squalor.

17:49.494 --> 17:50.826
I want to do it again.

17:50.828 --> 17:52.161
Absolutely not.
We are not doing this again.

17:52.163 --> 17:53.329
You know what?
I'm gonna consider it.

17:53.331 --> 17:54.463
Gah...
Frank,
have a seat.

17:54.465 --> 17:55.798
Oh, Charlie.
Yeah, yeah,

17:55.800 --> 17:56.799
have a seat,
all right.
Yeah, yeah.

17:56.801 --> 17:58.000
All right,
let's begin.

17:58.002 --> 18:00.636
Okay, uh, first topic
is cat food.

18:00.638 --> 18:01.871
You want to lead
with that?
Mm-hmm.

18:01.873 --> 18:03.672
Cat food.
Yeah.

18:03.674 --> 18:05.674
Okay.
You find a can of cat
food in the apartment.

18:05.676 --> 18:07.510
What do you
do with it?

18:07.512 --> 18:09.678
I don't do
nothing with it.

18:09.680 --> 18:11.981
Don't touch my shit,

18:11.983 --> 18:14.984
I don't touch your shit.

18:14.986 --> 18:16.352
Great.
Okay.

18:16.354 --> 18:17.820
He-he doesn't
touch your shit...
Yeah.

18:17.822 --> 18:19.388
That was very clear.
...and then you don't...

18:19.390 --> 18:21.323
So eloquent.
Very clear.
What are you writing?

18:21.325 --> 18:22.992
I filled in half
the can of cat food.

18:22.994 --> 18:24.660
It's sort of a
half-full answer.
Great.

18:24.662 --> 18:27.329
Trevor, your position
on the matter?

18:27.331 --> 18:29.398
I'd ask if the
can is yours,

18:29.400 --> 18:31.033
and, uh, if so,

18:31.035 --> 18:33.035
would you like me
to feed the cat?

18:33.037 --> 18:35.704
Oh...
Oh, see,
now he assumes

18:35.706 --> 18:37.206
that you have a cat.
Right.

18:37.208 --> 18:38.841
Smart.
He doesn't have a cat.

18:38.843 --> 18:40.342
CHARLIE:
Yeah, so...
Oh.

18:40.344 --> 18:41.577
Yeah.

18:41.579 --> 18:42.845
Kind of a waste
to-to feed a cat

18:42.847 --> 18:44.180
that's not mine.

18:44.182 --> 18:47.216
For me, it depends
on how hungry I was.

18:47.218 --> 18:48.918
Or sleepy.

18:48.920 --> 18:50.252
Oh, very interesting.

18:50.254 --> 18:51.587
Couple points for
Frank right there.

18:51.589 --> 18:53.055
W-Why?
Well, I don't understand.

18:53.057 --> 18:54.757
He gets points for...

18:54.759 --> 18:57.693
Yeah, eating it
and then...
Well, if I was hungry

18:57.695 --> 18:59.562
and the cat food was there,
I'd eat it.
And if you
were sleepy...

18:59.564 --> 19:00.863
If I couldn't go to sleep...
You would...

19:00.865 --> 19:02.198
I would eat the cat food
and go to sleep.

19:02.200 --> 19:03.532
'Cause it might
make you go to sleep!

19:03.534 --> 19:04.767
All right.
In what scenario

19:04.769 --> 19:06.202
do you not eat
the cat food?

19:06.204 --> 19:07.870
I would always eat the cat food.
Yeah, no.

19:07.872 --> 19:09.405
Exactly right.
See, now there's a man

19:09.407 --> 19:10.739
who's-who's thinking
on his feet.

19:10.741 --> 19:12.541
MAC: Trevor is
a great roommate.

19:12.543 --> 19:14.210
He's a nice guy;
he doesn't have

19:14.212 --> 19:16.078
the experience, though.
Experience? In what?!

19:16.080 --> 19:18.047
Well, all these good things.
Let's keep talking.

19:18.049 --> 19:20.549
Hey, I'm sorry,
am I... too late?
Oh.

19:20.551 --> 19:22.051
CHARLIE:
Wow, hi!

19:22.053 --> 19:23.552
What-what are you
doing here?

19:23.554 --> 19:25.121
I called her, actually.
I left her a message

19:25.123 --> 19:26.755
'cause I thought she might need
a place to live.

19:26.757 --> 19:29.258
The last couple of years
have been pretty rough on me,

19:29.260 --> 19:31.293
and now I'm living
in a women's shelter, so...

19:31.295 --> 19:32.895
Oh...
Yeah, I figured that.
'Cause she's the worst.

19:32.897 --> 19:34.296
Is the apartment
still available or not?

19:34.298 --> 19:35.931
Well, yeah, it's
definitely available.

19:35.933 --> 19:37.299
Great.
Yes!

19:37.301 --> 19:38.567
Oh, I've brokered a deal!

19:38.569 --> 19:40.903
Oh, no, come on, Charlie.

19:40.905 --> 19:42.571
I-I'm sorry, Frank,
but, you know,

19:42.573 --> 19:44.073
I'm not gonna give
up an opportunity

19:44.075 --> 19:45.307
to have the waitress
as a roommate.

19:45.309 --> 19:46.775
A roommate?
N-n-n... no, no.

19:46.777 --> 19:48.410
No, no, you did not say that.
You did not say

19:48.412 --> 19:49.578
he would still
be living here.

19:49.580 --> 19:51.113
MAC: That's true,
I did not say that,

19:51.115 --> 19:52.982
because I didn't think
you would come if I did.

19:52.984 --> 19:54.783
Yeah, well, you're goddamn right
I wouldn't have come.

19:54.785 --> 19:56.418
I am not living with Charlie.
Are you kidding?

19:56.420 --> 19:58.487
I would rather live
on the streets.

19:58.489 --> 19:59.588
You'd rather live
on the streets?
Yeah.

19:59.590 --> 20:00.789
What? Ow!

20:00.791 --> 20:02.424
Ow, my God!
What are you doing?

20:02.426 --> 20:03.792
Put me down!
What the hell
are you doing?

20:03.794 --> 20:05.127
Charlie, what
are you doing?
Ow!

20:05.129 --> 20:07.263
I was gonna throw her
out the window

20:07.265 --> 20:09.165
and send her
back to 2006!
You were gonna
throw me out the window?

20:09.167 --> 20:10.599
What the hell
is wrong with you?!
CHARLIE:
It's a time portal!

20:10.601 --> 20:12.635
Back in time!
We could start over again!

20:12.637 --> 20:15.171
(arguing continues)
This is really good.

20:17.508 --> 20:20.776
(echoing):
This is ham soaked in rum.

20:20.778 --> 20:21.844
Rum ham, rum ham.

20:21.846 --> 20:22.778
...and make me another.

20:22.780 --> 20:24.346
Rum ham!

20:24.348 --> 20:25.147
Who wants rum ham?

20:25.149 --> 20:26.315
(screaming)

20:26.317 --> 20:27.216
Charlie...!

20:29.453 --> 20:31.353
You are such a psycho.
The window is a time portal

20:31.355 --> 20:33.122
to 2006.
What is he
talking about?

20:33.124 --> 20:35.124
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:35.126 --> 20:37.693
What the hell's everybody doing
in my apartment?

20:41.465 --> 20:42.798
We having a gang bang?

20:42.800 --> 20:44.133
Oh, my God. Get...

20:44.135 --> 20:45.367
Get the hell
out of my way.

20:45.369 --> 20:47.002
Welcome back,
Frankie!

20:47.004 --> 20:48.304
(laughing)

20:48.306 --> 20:49.538
Oh, the farts, man.

20:49.540 --> 20:50.839
That's good.
Oh. Oh, the fart.

20:50.841 --> 20:52.808
MAN:
<i> Yeah, sorry,</i>

20:52.810 --> 20:54.710
I can't cash this check.

20:54.712 --> 20:56.679
Why? I mean,
I know the number's really,

20:56.681 --> 20:58.347
really big, but the check
is real. Are you sure you...

20:58.349 --> 21:00.049
Oh, yeah, yeah.
That's a real check.

21:00.051 --> 21:01.050
No, it's outdated.

21:01.052 --> 21:02.318
No, he just wrote it yesterday.

21:02.320 --> 21:05.154
No, it is clearly
