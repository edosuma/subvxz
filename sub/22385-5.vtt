00:16.056 --> 00:18.491
Give me your phone, now. 

00:18.559 --> 00:20.160
Now, Vanya.

00:37.517 --> 00:40.586
We have to be invisible. Understand?

00:49.162 --> 00:50.563
You're bleeding.

00:50.631 --> 00:52.331
We gotta get you to a hospital.

00:52.398 --> 00:55.467
<i>Nyet.</i> We keep moving.

01:12.686 --> 01:13.686
Patterson.

01:13.720 --> 01:16.155
Hey, I'm glad you came.

01:16.524 --> 01:18.724
So, I've been analyzing...

01:19.198 --> 01:22.367
the ink from the birth records, and...

01:24.097 --> 01:25.531
I did your adoption.

01:26.933 --> 01:28.968
It says he did an adoption for <i>me.</i>

01:31.139 --> 01:32.699
They're real.

01:34.173 --> 01:37.308
You had a baby. A daughter.

01:40.080 --> 01:42.348
No. No, I...

01:42.549 --> 01:45.117
These came from a guy
who's an expert forger.

01:45.185 --> 01:47.319
We can't trust him.
These could all be fake.

01:47.387 --> 01:48.721
They're not.

01:48.789 --> 01:49.899
I contacted...

01:49.924 --> 01:51.706
Okay, so he backstopped everything.

01:51.792 --> 01:53.567
- That's what...
- Jane, let's...

01:53.592 --> 01:54.959
let's just hear her out.

01:55.065 --> 01:56.862
First, I called the hospital.

01:56.930 --> 01:59.227
And, unfortunately,
all of the birth records

01:59.252 --> 02:01.420
before 2000 were destroyed in a flood.

02:01.468 --> 02:02.820
Yeah, doesn't that seem weird to you?

02:02.845 --> 02:06.035
It did, until I verified
your obstetrician's signature.

02:06.060 --> 02:08.127
I cross-referenced it
with basically everything

02:08.151 --> 02:09.675
that she's ever signed.

02:09.743 --> 02:12.611
Prescriptions, uh,
checks, her mortgage.

02:12.679 --> 02:14.313
Okay, well, let's bring her in,

02:14.381 --> 02:15.848
see if she recognizes me.

02:17.517 --> 02:19.251
She passed away five years ago.

02:21.221 --> 02:22.555
Of course she did.

02:22.622 --> 02:25.224
Jane, this is a real signature...

02:25.292 --> 02:29.995
real hospital letterhead
with real 18-year-old ink.

02:31.398 --> 02:33.966
How could I forget I had a child?

02:37.337 --> 02:40.072
Forget that I gave birth.

02:40.140 --> 02:43.442
I mean... you had your memory erased.

02:43.510 --> 02:45.845
Is there some kind of test
that I can...

02:45.912 --> 02:47.847
I'm sorry. Pregnancy tests exist,

02:47.914 --> 02:49.281
but birth tests don't.

02:49.306 --> 02:50.767
Jane, if you need some time...

02:50.792 --> 02:55.094
No, I don't need time.
I need the truth.

02:55.388 --> 02:57.092
You're sure about this?

02:57.724 --> 02:59.734
I mean, I'm not 100% certain,

02:59.759 --> 03:01.332
but no reputable scientist
would ever claim...

03:01.357 --> 03:02.819
Okay, then keep digging.

03:02.926 --> 03:04.630
- Jane.
- Keep... no, I'm... I'm done

03:04.698 --> 03:07.584
with being manipulated, Kurt.

03:08.101 --> 03:10.043
I'm done with lies.

03:11.351 --> 03:12.985
Patterson, give us a sec.

03:13.507 --> 03:14.974
Of course.

03:22.254 --> 03:25.317
I used to think I was Taylor Shaw...

03:25.385 --> 03:27.086
until all of that,

03:27.154 --> 03:28.521
my whole sense of who I was,

03:28.588 --> 03:30.489
was ripped away.

03:30.781 --> 03:32.691
So, I can't... I can't just...

03:32.759 --> 03:34.493
I can't do it again.

03:34.561 --> 03:36.529
I understand.

03:46.705 --> 03:50.309
Uh-oh. Looks like somebody
needs my Wizardville expertise.

03:50.613 --> 03:52.753
Let me guess, you made it
all the way to the Elfin Moat

03:52.778 --> 03:54.613
and can't figure out how
to raise the drawbridge.

03:54.681 --> 03:56.282
I own that drawbridge.

03:56.349 --> 03:58.308
Excuse me. What's up?

03:58.605 --> 04:00.439
I was hoping you could tell me.

04:01.894 --> 04:04.262
What were you doing with Jonathan West?

04:09.572 --> 04:10.739
What?

04:10.807 --> 04:12.674
I texted you and you said
you were going home,

04:12.742 --> 04:14.910
but you were with that tool
from the State Department,

04:14.978 --> 04:16.743
same day he lost our perp.

04:16.805 --> 04:18.249
So, you're following me now?

04:18.353 --> 04:21.255
I just happened to see him
get into your car.

04:21.363 --> 04:23.431
Look, I'm...

04:23.586 --> 04:25.302
I'm sure you have a good reason for...

04:25.327 --> 04:26.527
I don't need a reason.

04:26.552 --> 04:27.933
I'm the assistant director
of this office.

04:27.958 --> 04:29.625
What about that is unclear to you?

04:29.993 --> 04:31.383
I didn't mean to upset you, I...

04:31.473 --> 04:33.841
Hey, I have a tattoo
I want you guys to see.

04:34.036 --> 04:36.237
- Can we at least...
- No, we can't.

04:37.694 --> 04:41.029
Okay, Jane has
33 new letters and numbers

04:41.164 --> 04:42.631
tattooed along her spine.

04:42.685 --> 04:45.387
The "backbone" of our case,
if you will.

04:45.606 --> 04:46.683
We will not.

04:46.708 --> 04:48.686
This string of alphanumeric characters

04:48.711 --> 04:51.513
matches a tracking number
to a box of evidence

04:51.581 --> 04:54.103
that was just scanned for transfer
by the police department.

04:54.128 --> 04:57.430
Wait, that's not the format
used by the NYPD.

04:57.674 --> 04:59.575
You used to be a cop, we get it.

04:59.602 --> 05:00.602
What's in the box?

05:00.669 --> 05:02.337
Zapata is right.

05:02.405 --> 05:05.808
The tracking format on the box
hasn't been used since '97.

05:05.833 --> 05:07.166
As for what's inside,

05:07.230 --> 05:08.830
the evidence manifest
isn't very helpful.

05:08.931 --> 05:10.408
Great, so we don't know
what's in the box.

05:10.433 --> 05:12.273
Yeah, well, it could be
anything at this point.

05:12.297 --> 05:14.169
Seized arms, a brick of cocaine,

05:14.197 --> 05:15.837
a murder weapon,
Gwyneth Paltrow's head...

05:15.861 --> 05:17.773
Well, whatever it is,
it's gotta be important.

05:17.807 --> 05:20.116
Why else would it be flagged
for transfer 20 years later?

05:20.141 --> 05:21.885
All right, Weller, Jane,
you guys go to the warehouse.

05:21.910 --> 05:23.554
All right, we'll intercept that box

05:23.579 --> 05:25.361
- before it gets transferred.
- Yeah, I'll come with.

05:25.386 --> 05:27.975
Nope, they can handle it.
I got paperwork for you.

05:30.546 --> 05:31.713
Fine.

05:38.235 --> 05:39.536
Wow.

05:39.662 --> 05:41.425
So it could be any one of these boxes.

05:41.805 --> 05:43.043
Heh, at least they're organized.

05:43.114 --> 05:44.832
Yeah, and their security's great.

05:44.871 --> 05:47.306
The clerk barely looked at my badge.

05:52.849 --> 05:54.183
FBI. Stop!

05:56.226 --> 05:57.226
Stop!

05:57.263 --> 05:58.764
Jane, over here!

06:16.916 --> 06:18.016
Uhh!

06:37.250 --> 06:38.483
Kurt!

06:39.466 --> 06:40.466
Kurt!

06:45.699 --> 06:47.099
Kurt!

06:49.203 --> 06:50.736
Kurt!

06:50.804 --> 06:51.904
Uhh!

06:58.912 --> 07:00.112
Stand back!

07:00.294 --> 07:01.461
Get back.

07:08.328 --> 07:10.362
- You okay?
- Uhh. Yeah.

07:13.593 --> 07:15.160
Patterson.

07:15.228 --> 07:17.164
<i>Weller, you need
to get out of there now.</i>

07:17.217 --> 07:19.192
Three evidence warehouses in Manhattan

07:19.217 --> 07:20.332
were just firebombed.

07:20.400 --> 07:21.467
They just hit here, too.

07:21.494 --> 07:22.814
So this is a synchronized attack.

07:22.838 --> 07:23.953
Was anyone hurt?

07:23.990 --> 07:26.358
Two casualties so far, both NYPD.

07:26.506 --> 07:28.073
What in the hell is in that box?

07:28.278 --> 07:30.779
Whatever's in it... somebody's willing

07:30.804 --> 07:33.190
to burn down half the city
to destroy it.

07:46.870 --> 07:48.840
Patterson, any leads on the arsonists

07:48.865 --> 07:50.206
that hit the other warehouses?

07:50.231 --> 07:52.614
Not yet.
Those facilities burned so fast,

07:52.639 --> 07:55.454
their CCTV systems liquefied
before any footage

07:55.479 --> 07:57.225
could be uploaded to an outside server.

07:57.250 --> 07:59.285
Their MOs appear to be
the same at each location...

07:59.310 --> 08:01.144
<i>gas and Molotov cocktails.</i>

08:01.392 --> 08:03.260
Kurt, I found the box!

08:13.445 --> 08:14.611
Oh...

08:14.679 --> 08:16.380
These are all rape kits.

08:19.617 --> 08:21.960
And they're all
untested, every one of them.

08:21.985 --> 08:23.886
Some of these are 20 years old.

08:24.015 --> 08:25.716
Why haven't these been processed?

08:25.741 --> 08:27.675
Unfortunately, law enforcement budgets

08:27.700 --> 08:29.283
don't make it a priority.

08:29.308 --> 08:31.475
<i>Homicide and narcotics take precedent.</i>

08:31.500 --> 08:34.309
Sexual assault is an... afterthought.

08:34.552 --> 08:37.393
Tasha's right, there's
a huge backlog of untested kits.

08:37.418 --> 08:39.890
<i>Yeah, like hundreds
of thousands across the country.</i>

08:39.916 --> 08:41.482
But all this evidence could be used

08:41.508 --> 08:43.022
to put away serial offenders.

08:43.047 --> 08:45.607
We could be preventing future attacks.

08:45.632 --> 08:48.300
I know. The... the system is broken.

08:48.333 --> 08:51.068
Well, looks like someone's
trying to fix it.

08:52.385 --> 08:55.480
New York State just
passed legislation last week

08:55.520 --> 08:58.739
earmarking funds to process
backlogged rape kits.

08:58.764 --> 09:00.531
Which is why this box
is being transferred.

09:00.556 --> 09:02.790
Because they were finally
going to be tested.

09:02.993 --> 09:05.061
Which, clearly, somebody doesn't want.

09:05.162 --> 09:06.825
Maybe one of those kits incriminates

09:06.850 --> 09:09.151
<i>someone powerful... a senator, a CEO.</i>

09:09.194 --> 09:10.795
<i>Whoever it was,
they obviously didn't know</i>

09:10.820 --> 09:11.871
which box was theirs,

09:11.896 --> 09:13.357
so they just hit
every warehouse at once.

09:13.382 --> 09:15.416
And all those other rape kits
that were destroyed

09:15.441 --> 09:16.908
were just collateral damage.

09:17.188 --> 09:20.891
Proof of all those crimes,
all those histories... erased.

09:20.991 --> 09:22.671
<i>I'll notify our forensics unit.</i>

09:22.728 --> 09:24.594
<i>Those kits will receive
expedited testing.</i>

09:24.619 --> 09:26.120
We'll bring these in now.

09:26.364 --> 09:28.732
The Coast Guard just
found Stuart's phone,

09:28.757 --> 09:30.227
washed up on the shore of the Hudson.

09:30.252 --> 09:32.987
Oh, my God... this could be huge.

09:33.070 --> 09:35.188
Don't get too excited, that
thing's gonna be waterlogged.

09:35.213 --> 09:36.948
It's just a little damp.

09:37.689 --> 09:39.782
- Okay, it's soggy.
- It's useless.

09:39.810 --> 09:41.611
Do you know who you're talking to.

09:42.201 --> 09:44.835
Thank you! Ye of little faith.

09:44.903 --> 09:47.104
I may still be able to recover
the last text message

09:47.172 --> 09:48.806
Stuart sent the night he was killed.

09:48.833 --> 09:50.045
I thought those were already scrubbed

09:50.070 --> 09:51.165
from his cell provider service.

09:51.190 --> 09:53.608
Yeah, but the text may still
be in the phone's memory.

09:53.883 --> 09:55.323
All right, just don't waste any time

09:55.348 --> 09:57.316
if it starts feeling like a dead end.

10:01.371 --> 10:03.528
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know.

10:03.553 --> 10:04.857
I know he's a skeptical guy,

10:04.882 --> 10:05.982
but first, he lied to you

10:06.007 --> 10:07.467
about meeting with
the State Department,

10:07.492 --> 10:08.854
and now he's trying to wave me off

10:08.879 --> 10:10.880
the biggest lead we have
in Stuart's murder?

10:10.962 --> 10:13.430
Something's not right.

10:22.373 --> 10:23.940
Your Russian is good,

10:23.965 --> 10:25.358
but my English is better.

10:25.383 --> 10:27.153
Great, so you'll understand this.

10:27.178 --> 10:29.477
- Life in prison, no parole.
- We want names.

10:29.502 --> 10:31.778
And I want Russia to win World Cup.

10:33.318 --> 10:35.018
Who do you work for?

10:35.133 --> 10:36.417
Myself.

10:36.521 --> 10:38.165
Oh, hmm!

10:38.190 --> 10:39.590
So, you're the boss.

10:40.125 --> 10:43.073
So, you're confessing to killing
two active-duty cops?

10:44.662 --> 10:47.397
Dmitry Gagarin, he is one,
he tell me about job.

10:47.422 --> 10:49.056
Who the hell is he?

10:49.081 --> 10:51.082
Your pretty friend here,
she killed him.

10:51.195 --> 10:52.693
What else did Dmitry tell you?

10:52.718 --> 10:53.819
Nothing.

10:53.878 --> 10:55.846
I get paid to make it burn,

10:56.147 --> 10:57.548
not to ask questions.

10:57.573 --> 10:58.973
So, how are you paid?

10:59.043 --> 11:00.588
Lawyer.

11:01.205 --> 11:02.796
We're done here.

11:04.649 --> 11:07.184
Oh, beta team just picked up two guys

11:07.252 --> 11:09.086
at the other warehouse.

11:10.301 --> 11:12.603
So, we can make a deal with them.

11:12.749 --> 11:13.783
Great.

11:13.808 --> 11:15.042
Have fun at Rikers.

11:15.100 --> 11:16.333
Yeah.

11:17.421 --> 11:19.623
Direct deposit.

11:22.300 --> 11:24.446
What bank? And under what name?

11:24.568 --> 11:28.671
East Bank, under alias Igor Belostok.

11:29.007 --> 11:31.041
We make deal now?

11:34.092 --> 11:35.692
I dug into Igor's bank accounts.

11:35.793 --> 11:38.762
Our perp received three
massive deposits

11:38.809 --> 11:41.708
from a cafe called
Emily's Place in Newark,

11:41.815 --> 11:43.801
which, shock of all shocks,
doesn't exist.

11:43.826 --> 11:45.093
- Another dead end.
- No.

11:45.118 --> 11:47.400
Dmitry Gagarin
was a dead end, literally.

11:47.425 --> 11:50.708
But this, this was a big lead
in need of a little math.

11:50.733 --> 11:52.133
All right, so take a look at these.

11:52.158 --> 11:53.873
All of the deposits from Emily's Place

11:53.898 --> 11:54.967
are in weird amounts.

11:54.992 --> 11:57.300
No identical deposits,
no round numbers.

11:57.351 --> 11:58.593
Which got me thinking,

11:58.618 --> 12:00.919
what if these were converted
from a foreign currency?

12:00.944 --> 12:04.279
So, I wrote a program
that calculated these amounts

12:04.304 --> 12:05.938
in every world currency,

12:05.963 --> 12:09.499
and then I converted them
to the Kazahrusian ruble.

12:09.524 --> 12:11.492
Voila, round figures.

12:11.517 --> 12:14.900
Three payments of 50,000 rubles each.

12:14.925 --> 12:17.299
So, whoever wanted
these rape kits destroyed

12:17.324 --> 12:18.441
is from Kazahrus.

12:18.475 --> 12:20.836
A country known
for human rights abuses.

12:20.861 --> 12:22.693
When do we get the DNA results back?

12:22.718 --> 12:24.000
A few hours.

12:24.025 --> 12:25.945
So, I've been doing research
on the rape victims,

12:25.970 --> 12:28.508
and only two have ties to Kazahrus...

12:28.533 --> 12:30.911
Jessica Wells and Yasmine Petrushev.

12:30.936 --> 12:33.037
Back in '97, Jessica ran a hedge fund

12:33.062 --> 12:35.930
with investments in
Kazahrusian hydrocarbon firms.

12:35.955 --> 12:38.305
Yasmine worked
at the Kazahrusian embassy.

12:38.343 --> 12:39.543
All right, give me addresses,

12:39.611 --> 12:40.715
I'll send teams
to talk to both of them.

12:40.740 --> 12:41.747
Copy that.

12:41.772 --> 12:42.872
Hey...

12:42.980 --> 12:44.914
- What's up?
- Uh, how you doing?

12:45.109 --> 12:48.424
I know this news about Jane's
daughter affects you, too.

12:48.505 --> 12:50.172
I'm fine. Yeah.

12:50.247 --> 12:51.441
Come on.

12:57.094 --> 12:59.363
I wanna be there for her.

12:59.517 --> 13:01.351
But I don't know how.

13:01.492 --> 13:04.627
Just... listen to her,

13:04.795 --> 13:06.563
and don't try to fix it.

13:06.644 --> 13:08.438
That's the problem.

13:09.173 --> 13:11.108
I can't fix it.

13:12.977 --> 13:14.503
I can't.

13:32.897 --> 13:33.897
Hello?

13:33.965 --> 13:36.233
Patterson's been a busy beaver.

13:36.301 --> 13:38.027
- Roman.
<i>- Calling the hospital</i>

13:38.052 --> 13:39.214
<i>where you had the baby,</i>

13:39.246 --> 13:41.038
digging through birth records.

13:41.105 --> 13:42.105
Roman, please.

13:42.173 --> 13:43.674
You don't have to play Sherlock

13:43.741 --> 13:45.431
on this one, Jane.

13:45.770 --> 13:48.645
You can just ask your brother.

13:48.705 --> 13:52.149
Yeah, okay. Did I give up my child?

13:52.970 --> 13:54.204
She was beautiful.

13:54.419 --> 13:56.353
<i>You used to sing to her,</i>

13:56.421 --> 13:58.722
<i>rock her to sleep in your arms.</i>

14:15.619 --> 14:17.420
That song...

14:18.876 --> 14:19.876
It's true.

14:19.911 --> 14:21.805
Why would I lie?

14:22.459 --> 14:25.161
The truth is painful enough.

14:25.350 --> 14:27.818
It's Roman. Track the call.

14:27.885 --> 14:29.820
What's he saying?

14:29.887 --> 14:31.088
Why did I do it?

14:31.155 --> 14:32.342
You didn't.

14:32.369 --> 14:34.570
<i>Our... mother took her.</i>

14:38.883 --> 14:40.373
<i>I guess having a granddaughter</i>

14:40.458 --> 14:42.809
didn't exactly fit into her plans,

14:42.834 --> 14:43.934
so she gave her away.

14:43.961 --> 14:45.570
Then why didn't I fight to keep her?

14:45.595 --> 14:47.648
<i>You did. We both did.</i>

14:47.673 --> 14:48.994
<i>But you know Shepherd.</i>

14:49.019 --> 14:50.954
No. No, I should have done more!

14:51.055 --> 14:54.095
You ran. That's how you coped.

14:54.525 --> 14:56.593
Why do you think you enlisted
in the military?

14:56.693 --> 14:57.860
Who's the father?

14:58.049 --> 14:59.850
<i>Your high school sweetheart.</i>

14:59.917 --> 15:03.019
<i>Nice enough guy, I guess.
Shepherd hated him.</i>

15:03.087 --> 15:06.189
Tried to stop you
from seeing each other.

15:06.257 --> 15:08.925
Where is she? Where is my daughter?

15:08.993 --> 15:11.628
How's Patterson doing on that trace?

15:14.031 --> 15:15.465
Maybe next time.

15:15.533 --> 15:17.067
Roman!

15:17.969 --> 15:19.357
I'm sorry, Jane.

15:19.382 --> 15:21.338
Tell me you got his location.

15:21.406 --> 15:24.408
I tried. But he's masking the call.

15:24.475 --> 15:26.710
First, it routed through Europe,
and then to Antarctica.

15:26.778 --> 15:29.112
He knew Patterson
contacted the hospital.

15:29.180 --> 15:30.480
Find out how.

15:30.548 --> 15:31.548
Are you okay?

15:31.582 --> 15:33.417
No, I'm not.

15:35.672 --> 15:37.255
I'll talk to her.

15:47.645 --> 15:49.278
I have to talk to Shepherd.

15:49.408 --> 15:51.835
It's the last thing I wanna do...

15:52.376 --> 15:54.610
but I need answers.

16:02.580 --> 16:03.713
You can't trust her.

16:03.781 --> 16:05.515
She'll play mind games with you,

16:05.583 --> 16:06.950
mess with your head.

16:07.018 --> 16:10.020
How could I have let her take my child?

16:10.285 --> 16:12.422
You were a child yourself.

16:12.749 --> 16:14.616
You were 16, Jane.

16:15.833 --> 16:17.488
You have a daughter.

16:19.600 --> 16:23.433
Would you ever let
someone take Bethany?

16:23.794 --> 16:26.896
No... you'd die to protect her.

16:29.279 --> 16:33.082
But... I just let mine go.

16:40.651 --> 16:42.151
Hey.

16:45.606 --> 16:47.340
Well, Reade was right.

16:47.408 --> 16:49.376
I couldn't get anything
off of Stuart's phone.

16:49.443 --> 16:53.334
The motherboard was saturated,
and it's... it's a lost cause.

16:53.761 --> 16:55.200
Not necessarily.

16:55.383 --> 16:57.050
I'm telling you, the phone is mush.

16:57.078 --> 16:58.408
This isn't a "leave it
in rice" situation...

16:58.433 --> 17:00.034
Yeah, but nobody knows that.

17:02.376 --> 17:03.877
So, what if we bluff?

17:03.958 --> 17:05.392
Claim that we found something?

17:05.465 --> 17:08.233
See if anyone at the FBI
tampers with it.

17:08.429 --> 17:09.930
Ooh, that's good.

17:09.997 --> 17:12.732
We can flush out whoever is
covering up Stuart's murder.

17:12.800 --> 17:14.099
Exactly.

17:15.717 --> 17:17.483
You're gonna wanna see this.

17:20.074 --> 17:21.875
The rape kit DNA results came back.

17:21.943 --> 17:24.185
Yasmine Petrushev,
the woman who was working

17:24.210 --> 17:26.329
at the Kazahrusian embassy
at the time of her attack,

17:26.354 --> 17:29.442
was raped by the late Ivan Valdemaras.

17:29.483 --> 17:31.434
- As in "King Valdemaras"?
- Yeah.

17:31.459 --> 17:34.287
In January of 1997, during
the time of her assault,

17:34.355 --> 17:36.356
King Ivan was stateside

17:36.424 --> 17:38.391
attending a natural resources summit.

17:38.459 --> 17:41.428
How does the FBI have King Ivan's DNA?

17:41.495 --> 17:43.663
They don't, the CIA does...
we stole some samples

17:43.731 --> 17:45.832
while he was having
bypass surgery in Switzerland.

17:45.900 --> 17:47.968
Wait, the king died this year, though.

17:48.035 --> 17:49.955
Didn't his younger brother
take over the throne?

17:49.980 --> 17:50.980
That's right.

17:51.005 --> 17:52.648
Uh, the team at Yasmine's apartment

17:52.673 --> 17:53.735
says it's been ransacked.

17:53.760 --> 17:55.081
There's a trail of blood
leading outside.

17:55.106 --> 17:56.740
They also found these.

17:58.512 --> 17:59.713
Yasmine has a son.

17:59.780 --> 18:01.615
Wait. You don't think that that's...

18:01.682 --> 18:03.100
His name's Vanya Petrushev.

18:03.125 --> 18:05.484
Born October 8, 1997,

18:05.509 --> 18:07.563
nine months after Yasmine was raped.

18:07.588 --> 18:09.623
Attacking those evidence facilities,

18:09.690 --> 18:10.924
coming after him at his home,

18:10.992 --> 18:13.393
they're trying to erase
all record of him.

18:13.441 --> 18:16.242
Because he's the rightful heir
to the Kazahrusian throne.

18:16.267 --> 18:17.532
This is a war of succession.

18:17.557 --> 18:19.158
And if they're willing to kill cops

18:19.183 --> 18:20.749
just to destroy DNA evidence,

18:20.774 --> 18:23.676
imagine what they'll do
just to get that kid.

18:27.788 --> 18:31.556
There are no rules, understand?

18:31.772 --> 18:35.642
We do whatever is necessary
until the boy is dead.

18:39.078 --> 18:40.489
In addition to bein the heir

18:40.514 --> 18:41.725
to the Kazahrusian throne,

18:41.752 --> 18:43.895
Vanya is also a student at NYU.

18:43.920 --> 18:45.619
Or <i>was...</i> the blood found

18:45.644 --> 18:46.936
at the apartment could have been his.

18:46.961 --> 18:48.172
Negative... forensics said the blood

18:48.197 --> 18:49.531
belonged to his mother, Yasmine.

18:49.556 --> 18:51.036
Matched the sample from her rape kit.

18:51.061 --> 18:52.728
All right, so where are on finding him?

18:52.753 --> 18:54.187
We got a hit on our APB.

18:54.332 --> 18:56.369
Yasmine's car was spotted
at a gas station

18:56.394 --> 18:57.851
in East Orange, New Jersey,

18:57.876 --> 19:00.775
and local cops found more blood
at the gas station bathroom.

19:02.494 --> 19:04.162
- So, they're on the run.
- Looks like it.

19:04.229 --> 19:05.373
They ditched their phones,

19:05.398 --> 19:07.266
and security cams
show Yasmine buying burners.

19:07.291 --> 19:09.790
She's trying to protect her son.

19:10.215 --> 19:12.316
Well, if it isn't
all my favorite people!

19:12.471 --> 19:14.013
What the hell
are you doing here, Weitz?

19:14.038 --> 19:16.286
Oh, no, that's Congressman Weitz,

19:16.342 --> 19:18.501
and I was invited.

19:18.738 --> 19:20.472
Well, don't look at me, darlings.

19:20.497 --> 19:22.073
- I called him.
- What?

19:22.181 --> 19:23.658
Congressman Weitz is a member

19:23.683 --> 19:25.188
of the House Committee
on Foreign Affairs.

19:25.213 --> 19:26.484
He's their expert on Kazahrus.

19:26.552 --> 19:28.786
I mean, somebody has to be, right?

19:28.854 --> 19:32.056
But listen, before we get into
this whole Kazahrusian nightmare,

19:32.124 --> 19:34.626
I wanna say thank you, sincerely.

19:34.693 --> 19:36.841
I never would have made it
to Congress so fast

19:36.866 --> 19:38.367
if it weren't for all of you.

19:38.731 --> 19:41.699
Oh, how is Nas, by the way?
Did she land on her feet?

19:43.168 --> 19:44.769
This better be worth it.

19:44.837 --> 19:46.571
Patterson, keep digging in on the kid

19:46.639 --> 19:47.799
and his mother's whereabouts.

19:47.840 --> 19:49.173
The rest of us are in with Weitz.

19:49.241 --> 19:50.608
I'm with her.

19:54.787 --> 19:56.321
I missed you, too.

19:57.816 --> 20:00.418
All right, three things
you need to know about Kazahrus.

20:00.486 --> 20:02.820
Number one, they are an absolute
monarchy, which means...

20:02.888 --> 20:06.691
The order of succession
is based solely on heredity.

20:06.759 --> 20:08.273
I think most of us studied civics.

20:08.298 --> 20:11.218
Number two, they are a crucial US ally.

20:11.243 --> 20:12.766
Without them, bye-bye, natural gas.

20:12.791 --> 20:14.117
How does this help us find the kid?

20:14.142 --> 20:16.134
Number three, their new king

20:16.201 --> 20:17.802
makes Stalin look like Santa Claus.

20:17.870 --> 20:19.203
So, he ordered the hit on Vanya?

20:19.271 --> 20:20.405
Oh, without a doubt.

20:20.472 --> 20:21.933
Meet King Cyrus Valdemaras,

20:21.958 --> 20:23.559
the brother of late King Ivan.

20:23.584 --> 20:26.853
And this is what happens
when you piss Cyrus off.

20:26.878 --> 20:28.579
Ohh. I remember this.

20:28.847 --> 20:30.915
Guy used sarin gas on his own people.

20:30.943 --> 20:32.423
Decimated a village for good measure.

20:32.447 --> 20:33.512
Oh, my God.

20:33.537 --> 20:35.849
Cyrus is not exactly known
for precision warfare.

20:35.874 --> 20:37.368
So, anyone in Vanya's vicinity...

20:37.393 --> 20:38.527
Has a target on their back.

20:38.552 --> 20:40.286
And we have a base in Kazahrus

20:40.311 --> 20:41.549
with 1,800 American soldiers on it,

20:41.574 --> 20:42.896
and we need to keep it that way.

20:42.921 --> 20:45.305
We lose that base,
we destabilize the region.

20:45.330 --> 20:47.165
But I don't get it... how did Cyrus

20:47.232 --> 20:48.755
even find out about the boy?

20:48.780 --> 20:50.164
Ivan died two months ago.

20:50.189 --> 20:51.985
Word is he made a deathbed confession.

20:52.010 --> 20:53.204
Why would he do that?

20:53.272 --> 20:56.029
Cyrus and Ivan had a bitter rivalry.

20:56.054 --> 20:57.574
And what better way to twist the knife

20:57.599 --> 20:59.428
than tell your little brother
he's being passed over.

20:59.453 --> 21:02.362
- Exactly.
- Only, instead of conceding to Vanya,

21:02.454 --> 21:04.255
Cyrus ordered his assassination.

21:04.382 --> 21:06.950
So we need to find this kid
before Cyrus' hitmen do.

21:06.975 --> 21:08.896
I'll call Homeland Security,
you three work together,

21:08.921 --> 21:11.196
try to ID his kill squad
and shut 'em down.

21:15.619 --> 21:16.919
You wanted to see me?

21:16.944 --> 21:18.872
Take a seat, Edgar.

21:19.298 --> 21:21.260
First name... that's never a good sign.

21:21.366 --> 21:23.067
I'm just worried about you, that's all.

21:23.215 --> 21:25.468
I heard you and Zapata had
a little fight this morning.

21:25.518 --> 21:27.487
Oh, this place is worse
than high school.

21:27.539 --> 21:29.027
What's going on with you two?

21:29.052 --> 21:30.519
Nothing.

21:30.544 --> 21:33.613
She saw me with West,
and she's a busybody, so...

21:33.660 --> 21:36.691
Is she the sort of busybody
who can keep her mouth shut?

21:36.949 --> 21:39.217
- Can you trust her?
- Of course, yeah.

21:39.242 --> 21:40.309
But it doesn't matter.

21:40.334 --> 21:41.658
I didn't tell her why I met with West.

21:41.683 --> 21:44.816
I'd be inclined to keep it
that way, if I were you.

21:45.290 --> 21:47.099
Don't worry about Tasha.
She's a friend.

21:47.172 --> 21:48.739
Well, so am I.

21:48.780 --> 21:50.881
I just don't wanna see you get burned.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.967
Thanks to the magic of social media,

21:55.992 --> 21:57.726
we figured out that Vanya
has a girlfriend.

21:57.751 --> 21:59.185
And this is relevant, why?

21:59.210 --> 22:02.145
Because Vanya sent her this...

22:02.170 --> 22:03.704
just 12 minutes ago.

22:03.816 --> 22:06.050
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

22:06.105 --> 22:08.072
<i>I'm sorry I took off.
It's just temporary.</i>

22:08.220 --> 22:10.889
<i>Um, I can't really say
anything else right now,</i>

22:11.022 --> 22:13.257
<i>but... I love you.</i>

22:13.519 --> 22:16.215
Aw, that's sweet, but I still
don't see why this is relevant.

22:16.240 --> 22:18.319
Vanya and his mom ditched their phones

22:18.344 --> 22:20.712
and bought burners,
so I can't track them directly.

22:20.737 --> 22:22.471
But you can track 'em
through this message.

22:22.496 --> 22:25.565
Bingo. It looks like he
took this video in a motel,

22:25.711 --> 22:27.678
so I scoured the background
for any clues.

22:27.759 --> 22:30.823
- And see these drapes?
- How can you not?

22:30.848 --> 22:34.084
When I did a comprehensive
image search for this fabric,

22:34.109 --> 22:36.496
I discovered that
they are exclusively made

22:36.521 --> 22:38.297
for the Edgewood Suites hotel chain.

22:38.322 --> 22:40.470
Okay, so how many of those
are within close radius

22:40.495 --> 22:42.560
- to their last known location?
- Three.

22:42.585 --> 22:44.598
Jane and I'll head to the one
closest to the gas station.

22:44.623 --> 22:46.900
Yasmine was wounded,
so they can't get too far.

22:46.925 --> 22:48.281
I'll send teams to the other two.

22:48.306 --> 22:50.307
Keep us updated.

22:50.635 --> 22:52.869
Do you get it yet, Matthew?

22:52.944 --> 22:55.879
Or do you need me to...
run you through that again?

23:00.338 --> 23:03.440
Do you think Vanya knows
about who his father was?

23:03.508 --> 23:05.108
How he was conceived?

23:05.176 --> 23:07.242
If these people get
to them before we do...

23:07.267 --> 23:09.502
Don't worry, Jane. They won't.

23:09.570 --> 23:11.204
We're gonna get to them first.

23:11.271 --> 23:13.975
We're gonna keep 'em safe, I promise.

23:14.822 --> 23:17.750
And what about my daughter?
Who's looking out for her?

23:20.380 --> 23:22.882
I have to find her, Kurt.

23:22.950 --> 23:24.756
I have to know she's okay.

23:29.793 --> 23:31.056
Patterson, what do you got?

23:31.165 --> 23:32.318
You're headed to the right spot.

23:32.343 --> 23:33.667
They're in Room 317.

23:33.692 --> 23:35.159
Copy that.

23:54.147 --> 23:55.615
FBI!

23:55.682 --> 23:57.216
Stay back! Leave her alone!

23:57.284 --> 23:59.285
We're the FBI. Now, drop that weapon.

23:59.353 --> 24:00.353
I said, stay back!

24:00.420 --> 24:01.587
Hey, we're here to help you.

24:01.655 --> 24:03.922
Yeah? Like those other men?

24:03.995 --> 24:06.068
No, we are here
to protect you from them.

24:06.128 --> 24:08.798
They are on their way,
so we need to get you

24:08.823 --> 24:10.396
and your mom out of here now.

24:13.467 --> 24:14.867
Vanya, she's going to die.

24:15.325 --> 24:16.736
Stand back!

24:16.803 --> 24:17.904
Stand back!

24:20.761 --> 24:22.640
Vanya, we're here to help you.

24:22.680 --> 24:24.120
But I need you to put that gun down.

24:24.144 --> 24:25.203
I don't believe you.

24:25.228 --> 24:27.263
Okay. Here.

24:28.231 --> 24:29.465
See?

24:30.487 --> 24:32.855
We're not here to hurt you.

24:33.250 --> 24:36.767
Okay? I know that you're afraid.

24:37.168 --> 24:39.469
But I also know that
you wanna help your mom.

24:39.770 --> 24:42.038
And I know the feeling
of having someone

24:42.106 --> 24:43.306
that you love and you trust

24:43.374 --> 24:46.009
more than anyone in the world hurt.

24:48.139 --> 24:50.763
Let me try and stop the bleeding, okay?

24:51.882 --> 24:53.383
- Okay.
- Let me do that.

24:53.451 --> 24:54.717
Put the gun down.

24:54.785 --> 24:56.079
Put it down.

24:56.720 --> 24:58.321
Put it on the bed.

25:01.029 --> 25:02.269
We need to get him out of here.

25:02.293 --> 25:04.060
Okay, we need to get her to a hospital.

25:05.958 --> 25:08.272
Weitz just called in the
Diplomatic Security Service,

25:08.297 --> 25:10.058
so between them and our guys,

25:10.083 --> 25:11.454
this place is completely secure.

25:11.479 --> 25:13.213
Good, we can't take any chances.

25:13.428 --> 25:15.898
- How's Yasmine?
- I don't know.

25:16.029 --> 25:18.531
She's still in surgery.

25:18.603 --> 25:20.136
Poor kid.

25:25.699 --> 25:27.833
How you holding up, Vanya?

25:30.610 --> 25:33.612
I used to ask about him
when I was little.

25:35.456 --> 25:36.990
"Where is my dad? Where is he?

25:37.084 --> 25:40.086
Is he... Superman?"

25:40.173 --> 25:42.241
So stupid.

25:46.926 --> 25:48.712
You were just a kid.

25:48.769 --> 25:51.070
I kept asking, though.

25:51.845 --> 25:54.583
And then, when I turned 18...

25:55.863 --> 25:58.414
she finally told me about the attack.

25:58.578 --> 26:01.079
Did she ever tell you who he was?

26:01.395 --> 26:04.931
Last night, she came to my dorm.

26:06.226 --> 26:08.650
That's when she told me who he was.

26:10.024 --> 26:12.058
I'm so sorry, Vanya.

26:12.425 --> 26:16.075
I know it probably feels
like everything's different now,

26:16.129 --> 26:17.796
like you don't know
who you are anymore.

26:17.972 --> 26:20.014
I know exactly who I am.

26:20.368 --> 26:22.168
I'm my mother's son.

26:22.529 --> 26:24.346
And whatever that man did to her

26:24.371 --> 26:25.674
doesn't make him my father.

26:25.699 --> 26:29.001
He's... he's nothing to me.

26:31.798 --> 26:33.666
And I'm never going to Kazahrus.

26:33.733 --> 26:35.935
I'm staying here,
and I'm looking after her,

26:36.255 --> 26:38.490
just like she looked after me.

26:45.965 --> 26:47.526
- Any luck?
- <i>Nada.</i>

26:47.801 --> 26:50.202
Not even a partial print.

26:50.550 --> 26:53.010
I'm starting to think that
whoever hit Yasmine's house

26:53.035 --> 26:54.301
doesn't have fingers.

26:59.592 --> 27:02.808
Okay... someone just
logged into our server

27:02.883 --> 27:05.385
to access our bogus phone data.

27:05.926 --> 27:07.960
Here we go. Moment of truth.

27:13.354 --> 27:14.473
What, who is it?

27:14.507 --> 27:17.242
- It's Reade.
- No.

27:17.378 --> 27:18.833
It can't be.

27:18.858 --> 27:21.393
It... that doesn't make any sense.

27:23.550 --> 27:25.284
The test is flawed.

27:25.625 --> 27:26.791
He's out of the office.

27:26.816 --> 27:29.051
He has every right to review evidence.

27:29.255 --> 27:31.530
Does he also have every right
to destroy it?

27:31.565 --> 27:33.766
Look, he didn't even open the files.

27:33.994 --> 27:35.685
He just logged in and erased

27:35.710 --> 27:37.611
the last 50 uploads to the server.

27:37.677 --> 27:41.346
Come on. Reade would...
never be dumb enough to...

27:41.371 --> 27:43.238
He's covering his tracks.

27:46.473 --> 27:48.921
They say they're corrupted
by a system malfunction.

27:49.049 --> 27:50.459
I know my server.

27:50.484 --> 27:52.813
This is not a malfunction,
and it's no coincidence.

27:52.838 --> 27:54.806
There has to be an explanation.

27:56.129 --> 27:57.386
Reade is family.

27:57.411 --> 27:59.093
So was Borden.

28:06.713 --> 28:08.193
How do you feel, Mom?

28:10.203 --> 28:11.835
Do you need anything?

28:11.921 --> 28:12.952
No.

28:12.977 --> 28:14.744
I have everything I need.

28:16.036 --> 28:17.900
Gonna get you some water.

28:18.091 --> 28:20.089
No, Vanya. No.

28:20.206 --> 28:22.641
It's okay. I'll go with him.

28:22.709 --> 28:24.343
Come on.

28:26.813 --> 28:29.854
Thank you... for keeping him safe.

28:30.057 --> 28:32.158
You did that.

28:32.259 --> 28:34.493
You were so strong for him, Yasmine.

28:34.821 --> 28:36.789
I did what any mother would.

28:38.746 --> 28:42.304
Vanya comes from darkness...

28:43.236 --> 28:45.737
but he is my light.

28:45.872 --> 28:48.840
Please, promise me
you will protect him.

28:52.839 --> 28:54.581
I'll protect you both.

29:01.351 --> 29:02.351
Who did that?

29:02.376 --> 29:03.509
Who did that?

29:03.577 --> 29:04.731
How long till your constituents

29:04.756 --> 29:06.310
realize they made a terrible mistake?

29:06.335 --> 29:08.696
Ah, actually, my re-election is a lock.

29:08.721 --> 29:09.822
I'm polling great.

29:09.889 --> 29:11.356
Polls have been wrong before.

29:11.424 --> 29:13.753
Mm? Look at this face.

29:14.094 --> 29:16.165
Say, bro, I wouldn't
piss her off if I were you.

29:16.190 --> 29:17.229
She works for the CIA.

29:17.257 --> 29:18.511
Now, you really want her spying on you?

29:18.536 --> 29:19.614
Wait, wait.

29:19.639 --> 29:21.540
Ooh, sorry, congressman stuff.

29:21.565 --> 29:23.399
I gotta...

29:25.071 --> 29:27.762
Can you believe anyone
voted for that fool?

29:28.227 --> 29:31.028
Um, about this morning.

29:32.011 --> 29:33.298
I know you were looking out for me,

29:33.333 --> 29:34.633
and I... I appreciate it.

29:34.848 --> 29:36.815
But you gotta trust me too.

29:36.883 --> 29:38.657
- I do.
- Good.

29:38.711 --> 29:39.978
I think I've earned it.

29:40.180 --> 29:41.631
And if there's anything I can't handle,

29:41.656 --> 29:43.114
I'll be sure to tell you.

29:43.389 --> 29:44.561
Okay.

29:55.145 --> 29:57.035
You can't support the Patriots.

29:57.059 --> 29:58.217
You grew up in New York.

29:58.242 --> 30:00.122
Uh, yeah, but the Patriots win.

30:01.942 --> 30:03.281
Oh, what's wrong?

30:03.306 --> 30:05.541
Jones... where are you?

30:05.952 --> 30:07.862
Why aren't you outside her door?

30:07.960 --> 30:09.027
Jones, where the hell...

30:10.184 --> 30:11.751
Agh!

30:12.031 --> 30:14.305
Vanya! Vanya!

30:14.414 --> 30:15.748
- Shh shh! Shh!
- Vanya!

30:15.773 --> 30:18.153
Don't make a sound. Stay right here.

30:19.252 --> 30:21.920
Cyrus's hitmen are inside,
and they're dressed as FBI.

30:22.095 --> 30:24.029
We gotta get Vanya and
Yasmine out of here now.

30:24.097 --> 30:25.964
Come on!

30:27.300 --> 30:29.902
This whole hospital's under attack!

30:32.697 --> 30:33.883
We're under siege!

30:37.058 --> 30:39.059
They're on FBI comms.

30:40.069 --> 30:41.679
We're taking Vanya to the roof.

30:41.706 --> 30:43.622
Repeat, we're taking
the asset to the roof.

30:43.682 --> 30:45.150
We need a heli evac, now.

30:45.175 --> 30:46.556
Wait, hold on, we can't leave my mom!

30:46.611 --> 30:48.178
- We're not.
- Vanya!

30:48.246 --> 30:49.513
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

30:49.581 --> 30:51.215
- Come on, go!
- Go!

30:54.051 --> 30:56.086
Yasmine, come here.

30:56.374 --> 30:57.808
There you go.

30:59.216 --> 31:00.550
Stevens, open that door!

31:00.757 --> 31:02.557
I thought you were taking
the boy to the roof.

31:02.582 --> 31:03.594
The chopper's on its way.

31:03.661 --> 31:05.421
The Kazahrusians are on
our comms, all right?

31:05.445 --> 31:07.046
We fed them false intel.

31:09.134 --> 31:10.601
Give me the keys. All right.

31:10.668 --> 31:11.828
Take that team up to the roof

31:11.870 --> 31:13.372
and take out the mercenaries, move.

31:13.397 --> 31:15.298
All right, let's move!

31:28.319 --> 31:29.480
It's not Reade.

31:29.540 --> 31:31.755
What? How do you know?

31:32.146 --> 31:33.985
You know how Reade plays Wizardville?

31:34.218 --> 31:35.240
Yeah.

31:35.265 --> 31:36.460
Well, the program

31:36.528 --> 31:39.172
has a slight back door-ish.

31:39.197 --> 31:41.263
It's super not a big deal,
but before you point fingers,

31:41.287 --> 31:43.733
you should know that there
was no way to code it

31:43.758 --> 31:45.068
without being able to spy on users.

31:45.136 --> 31:47.821
Or, that's totally not
the word I wanted to use.

31:47.919 --> 31:50.202
I have never used it until now.

31:50.227 --> 31:52.629
- This seemed like an emergency...
- Patterson, I don't care!

31:52.875 --> 31:54.344
What did you find?

31:54.412 --> 31:56.146
Okay.

31:56.214 --> 31:58.849
Reade's supposed login...

31:58.917 --> 32:01.818
occurred from a computer
terminal within the FBI,

32:01.886 --> 32:03.587
but he wasn't even in the building.

32:03.655 --> 32:06.522
He was at Chris & John's
Coffee in Midtown.

32:08.506 --> 32:09.869
Someone used his login.

32:09.894 --> 32:11.082
He's getting framed.

32:14.490 --> 32:16.024
Weller? Everything okay?

32:16.049 --> 32:18.684
No, it's not.
We need backup immediately.

32:18.752 --> 32:20.353
<i>The Kazahrusians just hit the hospital.</i>

32:20.421 --> 32:21.888
What? How?

32:21.955 --> 32:23.986
We had FBI and DSS teams...

32:24.030 --> 32:26.443
I don't know, but we've
got Vanya and his mom.

32:26.493 --> 32:28.180
All right, we got 'em out in time.
We're headed...

32:28.228 --> 32:29.988
Headed south on Bronx River Parkway.

32:30.012 --> 32:31.045
We're tracking your cell.

32:31.113 --> 32:32.565
I just got word. How they doing?

32:32.633 --> 32:34.934
- We're on with Weller now.
- Oh, what's going on?

32:35.002 --> 32:36.131
The DSS just told me that...

32:36.156 --> 32:37.198
We're on it!

32:37.223 --> 32:38.543
Weller, I'm dispatching a convoy.

32:38.568 --> 32:40.470
They're 15 minutes out. Keep moving.

32:40.495 --> 32:41.519
<i>They will find you.</i>

32:41.544 --> 32:43.378
Copy that. Just keep us updated.

32:43.816 --> 32:45.143
I can't believe it.

32:45.168 --> 32:48.203
I'm calling the Foreign Affairs
Committee immediately.

32:50.083 --> 32:51.918
- Hey, it's gonna be okay.
- Yeah.

32:51.985 --> 32:54.220
We're taking you to a safe house.

32:58.124 --> 32:59.258
No!

33:03.330 --> 33:04.764
Why are we stopping?

33:04.832 --> 33:06.729
- Spike strip.
- Yeah.

33:06.846 --> 33:07.846
Kurt!

33:09.322 --> 33:11.190
Everyone down! Get down!

33:13.207 --> 33:14.574
Get down! Get down!

33:25.287 --> 33:26.628
Stay in the car.

33:26.653 --> 33:28.109
Stay down.

33:29.122 --> 33:30.589
Cover me!

33:31.258 --> 33:32.495
Uhh!

33:34.228 --> 33:35.654
Agh!

33:45.272 --> 33:46.772
No!

33:46.840 --> 33:47.907
Get out!

33:50.577 --> 33:51.844
Get out, get out!

33:54.248 --> 33:55.928
Come here, come here!

34:02.789 --> 34:04.235
You okay?

34:04.885 --> 34:06.386
Everyone okay?

34:11.264 --> 34:12.630
Nice work.

34:23.850 --> 34:26.478
Holy hell, am I glad to see you.

34:26.827 --> 34:28.447
We're glad to be seen.

34:28.648 --> 34:30.882
- Where's the mother?
- Yasmine's in with medical.

34:31.033 --> 34:32.608
They're redoing some of her sutures,

34:32.632 --> 34:34.630
but she's gonna be fine.

34:34.655 --> 34:36.145
Thanks to you guys.

34:36.170 --> 34:38.237
I mean, really, you guys are...

34:38.940 --> 34:40.306
seriously badass.

34:40.331 --> 34:42.431
Please don't, it'll go
straight to their heads.

34:44.739 --> 34:46.540
What did you find?

34:46.714 --> 34:49.099
I figured out who used Reade's login.

34:49.123 --> 34:51.559
I know who's trying to set
him up for Stuart's murder.

34:51.666 --> 34:53.299
Who?

34:53.324 --> 34:54.725
It was Hirst.

35:03.784 --> 35:07.587
How can you be so sure Hirst
is the one who framed Reade?

35:07.935 --> 35:09.702
I run biometric software
in the backgrounds

35:09.727 --> 35:11.194
of all of our computers.

35:12.432 --> 35:13.606
You want answers or not?

35:13.631 --> 35:15.899
I want you to consider the CIA.

35:16.137 --> 35:18.488
All right, what does
the program show us?

35:18.513 --> 35:20.457
The way each person uses a computer

35:20.482 --> 35:23.625
can be read like a...
unique digital signature.

35:23.658 --> 35:25.741
So, the way you type,
the way you click,

35:25.766 --> 35:27.000
the speed, the force...

35:27.025 --> 35:29.359
So, you tracked and analyzed
everyone's mouse

35:29.384 --> 35:31.078
- and keystroke habits?
- Yeah.

35:31.103 --> 35:32.849
So, she logged in as Reade,

35:32.874 --> 35:35.242
but it's her biometric signature.

35:35.267 --> 35:37.019
So, after she logged in,

35:37.044 --> 35:39.212
she deleted the evidence
off of our servers.

35:39.326 --> 35:41.060
Innocent people don't do that.

35:41.085 --> 35:43.553
If she thought she was erasing
the contents of Stuart's phone,

35:43.578 --> 35:45.218
then she definitely
has something to hide.

35:45.243 --> 35:46.483
Do you think she killed Stuart?

35:46.508 --> 35:48.784
Or she's covering up for whoever did.

35:48.809 --> 35:50.750
You think she also tampered
with Stuart's Kinga, too?

35:50.775 --> 35:52.810
She definitely has the reach.

35:53.908 --> 35:56.176
So, what else is Hirst hiding?

35:56.431 --> 35:59.759
She was real protective
of "Mr. Short Sell"

35:59.784 --> 36:01.598
Kevin Loewe a few cases ago.

36:01.669 --> 36:04.137
Kevin Loewe's one of the
biggest names on Wall Street.

36:04.284 --> 36:06.019
This evidence better be ironclad.

36:06.044 --> 36:09.225
She could have easily
downgraded the anonymous tip

36:09.250 --> 36:10.573
that pointed to him.

36:10.598 --> 36:11.906
Yeah, but why?

36:11.931 --> 36:14.533
I mean, does he handle
her investments or something?

36:16.678 --> 36:18.312
They knew each other.

36:18.353 --> 36:20.354
What?

36:20.661 --> 36:22.195
That's Hirst.

36:22.276 --> 36:24.613
"Law Review Editor-In-Chief
Eleanor Hirst

36:24.745 --> 36:27.380
with Managing Editor Kim Loewe."

36:27.455 --> 36:29.765
That is Kevin Loewe's first wife.

36:30.051 --> 36:32.152
They all went to Georgia together.

36:32.273 --> 36:34.241
That's a pretty big detail
not to mention.

36:34.342 --> 36:36.283
She's been manipulating tattoo cases.

36:36.308 --> 36:38.523
Because some of them point to her.

36:42.666 --> 36:44.838
While you guys were out
playing "Street Fighter,"

36:44.863 --> 36:47.823
I was busy trying to prevent
a major geopolitical crisis.

36:48.155 --> 36:50.392
King Cyrus is dead.

36:50.630 --> 36:52.427
- What?
- Yeah.

36:52.495 --> 36:53.895
Two hours ago, he was hanged

36:53.963 --> 36:55.523
at the behest of
the Kazahrusian elites.

36:55.547 --> 36:58.033
- Good.
- Nope, actually, not good.

36:58.101 --> 36:59.901
Now, the entire region is destabilized.

36:59.969 --> 37:02.201
The Kazahrusian
are demanding their heir.

37:02.261 --> 37:04.139
They want Vanya to come lead.

37:04.372 --> 37:06.975
- Absolutely not.
- Well, not your call to make.

37:07.043 --> 37:08.386
And what if he doesn't want to go?

37:08.411 --> 37:10.154
Well, then the Kazahrusians will assume

37:10.179 --> 37:11.874
we're holding him against his will.

37:11.941 --> 37:13.615
Our base outside the capital

37:13.683 --> 37:15.658
will be under siege before nightfall.

37:15.683 --> 37:18.173
One of the oligarchs
jockeying for power

37:18.198 --> 37:19.426
will attempt a coup.

37:19.451 --> 37:21.005
Chaos, rioting, massive casualties...

37:21.030 --> 37:22.234
Yeah, we get it.

37:22.259 --> 37:25.779
Or, Vanya can get on a plane.

37:25.804 --> 37:28.363
No. This isn't fair.

37:28.431 --> 37:31.566
He's 20 years old,
and he doesn't want this.

37:31.634 --> 37:34.202
Jane... that boy needs
to hear his options

37:34.270 --> 37:36.350
and know what's at stake.

37:36.671 --> 37:38.973
You, of all people,
should understand that.

37:43.231 --> 37:45.666
No one can force you to leave, Vanya.

37:47.419 --> 37:48.986
I know what it's like

37:49.011 --> 37:52.013
to live a life that's not your own.

37:56.592 --> 37:58.360
You don't have to do this.

37:58.501 --> 38:00.935
You... You don't have to go.

38:07.990 --> 38:09.505
Yes, I do.

38:13.815 --> 38:17.385
This, this is how I make things right.

38:18.464 --> 38:20.680
My whole life, I've heard
my grandparents talk

38:20.705 --> 38:24.189
about the horrors of Kazahrus.

38:25.049 --> 38:26.788
All the violence...

38:27.156 --> 38:29.745
friends jailed
for criticizing the monarch,

38:29.770 --> 38:31.071
massive food shortages.

38:31.096 --> 38:34.572
I mean, they risked
everything to come here.

38:35.133 --> 38:38.967
They sacrificed for my mom,
just like she sacrificed for me.

38:39.740 --> 38:42.904
So, what, now it's your turn?

38:46.484 --> 38:49.119
What if I can make things
better for these people?

38:49.144 --> 38:51.279
Don't I have to try?

38:54.964 --> 38:57.229
What part of "I need you to trust
me" didn't you understand?

38:57.254 --> 38:58.303
Look, we're sorry.

38:58.328 --> 39:00.116
But aren't you glad we're onto Hirst?

39:00.403 --> 39:01.513
Are you kidding me right now?

39:01.538 --> 39:03.773
Reade, come on, she used your login.

39:03.798 --> 39:05.988
- Allegedly!
- No, it was her.

39:06.016 --> 39:07.469
My biometric software...

39:07.494 --> 39:09.412
Is what, infallible, just like you?

39:09.437 --> 39:11.277
You want a gold star
for planting sham evidence

39:11.302 --> 39:13.062
on a server so you could
spy on other agents?

39:13.087 --> 39:14.647
That's not how we do things at the FBI.

39:14.672 --> 39:15.703
This is bigger than that, Reade.

39:15.728 --> 39:18.742
Hirst has been looking out
for me since I was in Quantico.

39:19.008 --> 39:20.746
I trust her, which
is more than I can say

39:20.771 --> 39:22.338
for either one of you right now.

39:22.363 --> 39:24.798
Do you guys realize this
is exactly what Roman wanted?

39:24.823 --> 39:26.731
He promised we'd be
at each other's throats,

39:26.756 --> 39:29.196
and look where we are right now,
playing right into his hands.

39:29.259 --> 39:31.424
Okay, would you at least consider...

39:31.449 --> 39:33.350
Some real evidence?
Absolutely, Patterson.

39:33.375 --> 39:34.648
Why don't you bring me some?

39:34.673 --> 39:36.548
Until then, I'm done
playing make-believe.

39:36.587 --> 39:38.318
Show yourselves out.

39:42.874 --> 39:45.025
They're too close.
He doesn't wanna see it.

39:45.115 --> 39:46.850
I hope that's all.

39:47.197 --> 39:49.999
Otherwise, he's covering for her.

40:06.014 --> 40:07.531
Whatcha thinkin' about?

40:09.859 --> 40:11.478
Nothing.

40:12.452 --> 40:15.178
You? How are you doing?

40:15.484 --> 40:16.885
Really.

40:19.897 --> 40:21.695
Today was hard.

40:22.719 --> 40:25.521
I can't stop thinking...

40:26.169 --> 40:28.008
I have a daughter.

40:29.103 --> 40:30.669
- Jane...
- I changed my mind

40:30.694 --> 40:32.084
about finding her.

40:32.922 --> 40:37.048
After seeing how Vanya's life
was upended, I just...

40:38.441 --> 40:40.763
I want her to be happy.

40:41.105 --> 40:43.873
And something tells me
that'll be a lot easier

40:43.941 --> 40:47.129
if she... doesn't know I exist.

40:54.030 --> 40:55.798
Whatever you want.

41:11.220 --> 41:14.355
Sir, she was just here.
You must have seen her.

41:15.606 --> 41:17.275
Can you ask around for me?

41:17.429 --> 41:19.275
Please, can you just take this photo...

41:22.680 --> 41:23.780
What...

41:23.847 --> 41:25.583
_

41:25.651 --> 41:28.977
_

41:29.026 --> 41:30.966
_

41:30.992 --> 41:33.545
_

41:33.570 --> 41:35.293
_

41:35.359 --> 41:36.733
I'll check.

41:37.795 --> 41:39.128
Thank you.

41:39.516 --> 41:41.631
And... thank you.

41:41.919 --> 41:43.319
Don't worry about it.

41:43.633 --> 41:45.667
We're looking for the same person.

41:47.604 --> 41:49.505
Jane Doe?

41:49.573 --> 41:52.875
Or Alice Kruger, Remi.

41:52.943 --> 41:54.577
She has a lot of names.

41:54.952 --> 41:56.568
Mine's Avery.

42:01.318 --> 42:03.152
How do you know Jane?

42:03.386 --> 42:05.120
She's my mother.
