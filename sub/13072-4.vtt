WEBVTT

00:00.360 --> 00:01.818
- Previously on Guilt...
- Stop!

00:01.819 --> 00:03.445
You know, there's something
off about Grace Atwood.

00:03.446 --> 00:05.405
We found blood on
the American girl's feet.

00:05.406 --> 00:07.407
This is cutting a little
close to home for you, huh?

00:07.408 --> 00:10.363
- What does that mean?
- This isn't Ashington.

00:10.410 --> 00:12.119
Donovan Trimbly.

00:12.120 --> 00:12.994
What do you want?

00:12.995 --> 00:14.621
You keep my secrets,

00:14.622 --> 00:16.873
I'll keep yours.

00:16.874 --> 00:18.205
I thought we said we
weren't gonna do this anymore.

00:18.206 --> 00:20.972
It's a pretty interesting
perspective, isn't it?

00:20.973 --> 00:22.111
It's dead on. This has got to been

00:22.112 --> 00:23.404
taken from the same floor

00:23.405 --> 00:24.671
of the building directly
across from them.

00:24.672 --> 00:26.509
This could be their stalker.

00:27.187 --> 00:28.896
It's just an old necklace
of hers I found.

00:28.897 --> 00:30.522
I don't remember Molly
ever wearing this.

00:32.046 --> 00:33.255
Go back to Belfast.

00:33.256 --> 00:34.340
If you can't agree to that,

00:34.341 --> 00:35.382
you're welcome to stay in London

00:35.383 --> 00:36.592
in a jail cell.

00:36.593 --> 00:39.262
The only person I have
in the world is you.

What's up, track star, can't keep up?

01:23.288 --> 01:25.623
Just going easy on you.

01:25.624 --> 01:27.917
Hey, thank God, the royal wedding fever

01:27.918 --> 01:30.711
is keeping the paparazzi busy.

01:30.712 --> 01:32.112
Yeah.

01:34.506 --> 01:36.467
Luc's place is only a block away.

01:36.468 --> 01:37.628
Race you.

01:46.674 --> 01:49.380
You sure you don't want
to come in, grab some water?

01:49.507 --> 01:51.675
I should probably get back to the hotel.

01:51.676 --> 01:53.344
Catch up on some work.

01:55.930 --> 01:58.823
Don't forget to close the blinds, okay?

02:20.663 --> 02:22.441
What the hell do you think you're doing?

02:22.466 --> 02:23.356
Hey! Let go.

02:25.751 --> 02:27.377
Give me the camera.

02:27.378 --> 02:28.796
Give it back.

02:29.964 --> 02:32.340
Grace! Grace!

02:32.341 --> 02:33.466
Call the police!

02:33.467 --> 02:35.051
- Grace.
- I am the police,

02:35.052 --> 02:37.930
and you're under arrest for assault.

03:32.729 --> 03:34.230
What are you up to?

03:35.523 --> 03:36.690
You look like death warmed up.

03:36.691 --> 03:37.888
Big night?

03:38.444 --> 03:40.528
- Yeah, something like that.
- It must have been.

03:40.529 --> 03:42.697
You don't usually ignore
my late night texts.

03:42.698 --> 03:44.712
I wasn't ignoring. I was just busy.

03:46.243 --> 03:47.660
Hmm.

03:47.661 --> 03:50.955
Someone's being economical
with the truth.

03:50.956 --> 03:52.374
What's with the thong?

03:53.378 --> 03:55.178
It was bothering me that Molly had

03:55.178 --> 03:57.756
so many posh things
for a poor girl from uni.

03:57.757 --> 03:59.117
I thought she might have a sugar daddy.

03:59.118 --> 04:01.885
This little bit of lace
and string cost 200 quid.

04:01.886 --> 04:03.735
I tracked it to a boutique on

04:03.760 --> 04:06.157
Pont Street but, unfortunately,
it was a dead end.

04:06.351 --> 04:07.768
They had no record

04:07.769 --> 04:09.147
of who purchased it.

04:13.149 --> 04:14.609
Well...

04:16.194 --> 04:18.947
this morning doesn't
have to be a total bust.

04:20.490 --> 04:23.952
The evidence room could be fun.

04:26.204 --> 04:28.288
Pike's waiting for me.

04:28.289 --> 04:30.294
Let him wait.

04:30.792 --> 04:32.669
He's a patient man.

04:38.133 --> 04:39.216
I've got to go.

04:39.217 --> 04:40.384
I'm really sorry.

04:40.385 --> 04:42.553
Come on.

04:45.223 --> 04:47.796
Can I just get five minutes?

04:47.830 --> 04:48.955
Everything all right?

04:48.956 --> 04:50.386
One of my investigators.

04:50.541 --> 04:53.426
You will never guess
who he's just arrested.

04:59.675 --> 05:02.468
I met you at Luc Pascal's
loft that night.

05:02.469 --> 05:04.804
You're with the crown
prosecutor's office, right?

05:04.805 --> 05:06.488
- That's right.
- Then you have the authority

05:06.489 --> 05:08.835
to drop this completely
unfounded assault charge.

05:10.102 --> 05:11.436
I had a reasonable belief that that man

05:11.437 --> 05:12.729
meant my sister harm, meant me harm.

05:12.730 --> 05:13.730
I don't know how you

05:13.731 --> 05:14.856
prosecutors do things

05:14.857 --> 05:15.898
in America, but over here

05:15.899 --> 05:17.442
we don't take kindly to people

05:17.443 --> 05:18.943
assaulting our officers.

05:18.944 --> 05:20.944
Your officer was acting
like a Peeping Tom.

05:21.363 --> 05:23.072
I was protecting my sister.

05:23.073 --> 05:24.998
I guess violence runs in the family.

05:25.898 --> 05:26.686
Excuse me?

05:27.772 --> 05:29.663
We really must stop meeting
like this, Gwendolyn.

05:29.663 --> 05:30.899
I agree.

05:31.540 --> 05:32.722
I'll see you in court.

05:33.530 --> 05:34.710
Great.

05:34.710 --> 05:36.753
I can't wait to hear
your investigator explain

05:36.754 --> 05:39.213
to the jury how he got
his ass kicked by a woman

05:39.214 --> 05:41.257
half his size after he

05:41.258 --> 05:42.884
bashed her head into the wall,

05:42.885 --> 05:44.677
making her actions self-defense,

05:44.678 --> 05:46.725
so, yeah, looking forward to that.

05:46.839 --> 05:48.601
I'll tell you what, while
we're in court, why don't we

05:48.626 --> 05:49.892
go down to the civil division

05:49.893 --> 05:52.692
so we can take care
of our personal injury suit?

05:52.719 --> 05:54.418
How's your head there, Natalie?

05:54.452 --> 05:56.537
It hurts quite a bit, actually.

05:56.538 --> 05:58.246
Oh, please.

05:58.247 --> 05:59.622
If you go after Natalie with this

05:59.623 --> 06:00.748
ludicrous charge,

06:00.749 --> 06:02.895
I will bury you in countersuits,

06:03.081 --> 06:06.375
and do not get me started on
the complaints I could generate

06:06.376 --> 06:08.960
around this Beatrice Linley

06:08.961 --> 06:10.083
fiasco.

06:11.172 --> 06:13.259
That has nothing to do with it.

06:13.353 --> 06:16.858
You had this woman in custody,
and then you let her walk back

06:16.859 --> 06:19.400
into the hospital to finish off
her husband, and then go see

06:19.401 --> 06:20.777
Grace Atwood

06:20.778 --> 06:22.611
for a two-for-one.

06:22.988 --> 06:26.949
Lady, I am gonna keep you
so busy with my paper war,

06:26.950 --> 06:29.994
you are not gonna be able
to prosecute a parking ticket,

06:29.995 --> 06:31.996
let alone the Molly Ryan case.

06:31.997 --> 06:33.372
So, yeah, let's

06:33.373 --> 06:34.999
go to court 'cause that

06:35.000 --> 06:36.376
sounds like a hoot.

06:41.423 --> 06:42.548
Enjoy this,

06:42.549 --> 06:44.175
because one day, your family

06:44.176 --> 06:46.136
won't be able to buy your way
out of your problems.

06:49.556 --> 06:52.233
Aren't you glad you didn't fire me?

06:52.976 --> 06:55.269
They've got a whole
team of investigators

06:55.270 --> 06:56.437
following Grace now.

06:56.438 --> 06:58.555
Why are they gunning for her so hard?

06:59.038 --> 07:01.260
They must have something on her
that we don't know about.

07:01.301 --> 07:03.469
I'm all over my Scotland Yard sources,

07:03.470 --> 07:04.762
I haven't heard anything.

07:04.763 --> 07:06.782
I might have a source, too.

07:11.812 --> 07:12.853
You're welcome.

07:31.485 --> 07:32.486
Luc, what's going on?

07:34.863 --> 07:36.558
Did you do a line
while I was in the shower?

07:36.585 --> 07:38.211
I was up all night. I needed something,

07:38.212 --> 07:39.962
or I'll never finish
these paintings in time.

07:39.963 --> 07:41.506
You need to keep a clear head.

07:41.507 --> 07:43.424
Now more than ever.

07:43.425 --> 07:45.009
We both do.

07:45.010 --> 07:46.844
I don't even know why
I'm doing this stupid show.

07:46.845 --> 07:48.806
That gallery's not interested in my art.

07:49.344 --> 07:50.703
What are you talking about?

07:50.704 --> 07:52.225
They called two days ago, Grace.

07:52.226 --> 07:54.894
They know that's not enough time
to produce quality work.

07:54.895 --> 07:56.361
This isn't about me.

07:56.772 --> 07:58.105
This is about Molly.

07:58.106 --> 07:59.144
So?

08:00.400 --> 08:01.776
Molly won't be any less dead

08:01.777 --> 08:03.277
if you don't do the show.

08:03.278 --> 08:04.278
Grace.

08:04.279 --> 08:05.393
No, I'm sorry.

08:05.739 --> 08:07.676
It's about time something good happened.

08:08.158 --> 08:11.911
So, if the gallery is
using you for your art,

08:11.912 --> 08:13.352
use them...

08:14.049 --> 08:15.342
and the press, too.

08:15.749 --> 08:18.836
Turn their spotlight
from you to your art.

08:21.088 --> 08:23.435
Your work is brilliant, Luc.

08:24.299 --> 08:26.451
It deserves to be seen.

08:30.657 --> 08:32.912
It's going to be an incredible night.

08:37.789 --> 08:39.895
One you'll want to remember forever.

08:44.646 --> 08:46.224
So promise me...

08:47.019 --> 08:48.023
no more blow.

08:48.771 --> 08:49.550
Please.

08:53.482 --> 08:54.732
I promise.

09:13.794 --> 09:15.218
You're late.

09:26.591 --> 09:28.509
Before I give you these,

09:28.510 --> 09:31.428
I just need to know, am I
covering up for a murderer here?

09:31.429 --> 09:33.346
If the Prince of Wales
had committed murder,

09:33.371 --> 09:36.141
do you really think
you'd have found the body?

09:36.142 --> 09:38.685
Okay, so he's the father
of the baby then?

09:38.686 --> 09:40.270
Ha, that makes sense.

09:40.271 --> 09:41.938
That's why we didn't get
a hit on the fetal DNA

09:41.939 --> 09:42.968
'cause the royals aren't
in the system, are they?

09:42.969 --> 09:45.336
But then why have me do this?

09:45.363 --> 09:47.656
It's not like we can
match any bodily fluids

09:47.657 --> 09:49.173
Prince Theo left on these, anyway.

09:49.347 --> 09:50.599
That was just a test.

09:51.711 --> 09:52.600
You've passed,

09:52.601 --> 09:55.102
and now I've got a little job for you.

09:55.103 --> 09:58.772
I need you to get a vial
of Molly Ryan's blood.

09:58.773 --> 10:00.357
To frame someone else.

10:00.358 --> 10:01.453
I don't think so.

10:01.454 --> 10:02.262
You didn't have a problem

10:02.287 --> 10:04.570
framing Donovan Trimbly, did you?

10:04.571 --> 10:05.566
All right, that...

10:05.860 --> 10:08.904
was me doing what I had
to do to stop a sick bastard

10:08.905 --> 10:11.615
locking another kid
in a basement and torturing him

10:11.616 --> 10:12.825
to death, all right?

10:12.826 --> 10:15.619
You know how to close a case,

10:15.620 --> 10:17.246
and that is what we need you to do.

10:17.247 --> 10:19.832
Find a solid suspect
and wrap up this investigation

10:19.833 --> 10:23.794
before anyone traces Molly Ryan
back to the prince.

10:23.795 --> 10:25.170
You're going to have
to find someone else

10:25.171 --> 10:26.797
to do your dirty work for you, I'm out.

10:26.798 --> 10:28.841
That's a choice,

10:28.842 --> 10:31.051
but every choice has
a consequence, doesn't it?

10:31.052 --> 10:33.345
This one includes being arrested
in front of your

10:33.346 --> 10:34.888
entire department

10:34.889 --> 10:37.641
and losing every quid you've got
to civil suits.

10:37.721 --> 10:39.597
Listen, if you were to expose me,

10:39.598 --> 10:41.724
every killer that I've ever
put away could be released.

10:41.725 --> 10:43.111
I mean, can you live with that?

10:43.158 --> 10:47.121
Question really,
is can you live with that?

10:53.960 --> 10:55.711
Mrs. Harris, we know
the photo had to be taken

10:55.712 --> 10:57.129
from this apartment.

10:57.130 --> 10:58.840
I don't know who could have taken it.

11:02.677 --> 11:03.970
Do you live alone?

11:05.138 --> 11:06.890
It's just me and my little boy.

11:10.268 --> 11:12.598
Yeah, it's a shame about that girl.

11:13.271 --> 11:15.064
You know, I did have
some painters out here

11:15.065 --> 11:16.092
about a month back.

11:16.093 --> 11:17.274
And I wouldn't have them back again,

11:17.275 --> 11:18.274
I'll tell you that much.

11:18.299 --> 11:20.195
Shifty sorts.

11:20.195 --> 11:21.779
Two weeks after they'd gone,

11:21.780 --> 11:23.155
I realized my
Diamond Portrait Jubilee stamps

11:23.156 --> 11:24.491
had gone missing.

11:26.235 --> 11:27.881
You got any contact details for them?

11:28.445 --> 11:29.385
Um.

11:30.113 --> 11:31.433
Let me see.

11:32.032 --> 11:33.768
I might have...

11:34.201 --> 11:35.849
the receipt somewhere.

11:38.872 --> 11:40.623
I'll track those painters down.

11:40.624 --> 11:42.745
Could be one of them's got
stalking on his resume,

11:43.168 --> 11:44.544
assaults on women.

11:44.545 --> 11:46.629
House painting...
that's a really good cover

11:46.630 --> 11:48.589
for a stalker when you think about it.

11:48.590 --> 11:49.857
It gives you great access to...

11:50.926 --> 11:52.343
homes.

11:52.344 --> 11:53.845
Um, I tell you what, mate,

11:53.846 --> 11:55.479
you, uh, you go on ahead.

11:55.480 --> 11:56.532
I'll take care of this.

11:56.533 --> 11:57.539
Sure.

12:00.152 --> 12:01.729
Don't forget the golden rule.

12:02.618 --> 12:05.061
The badge will get you women, but women,

12:05.869 --> 12:07.501
they'll get your badge.

12:17.615 --> 12:19.661
I heard you did a real number
on Officer Duncan.

12:20.635 --> 12:22.543
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:22.887 --> 12:23.760
You all right?

12:24.263 --> 12:26.527
Yeah, not bad.

12:27.767 --> 12:30.602
Maybe I should have let him
toss me in the slammer.

12:30.603 --> 12:31.785
Would have gotten me out of

12:31.786 --> 12:34.027
Grace's boyfriend's art show
tomorrow night.

12:34.649 --> 12:36.466
What are the odds
he's actually any good?

12:37.652 --> 12:39.540
Uh, a pint of ale for the lady, please.

12:39.565 --> 12:40.518
Gotcha.

12:41.320 --> 12:42.738
Make it two.

12:45.032 --> 12:48.254
Yeah, I-I don't think we should
really be drinking together.

12:49.004 --> 12:50.421
Who said we're drinking together?

12:50.422 --> 12:52.269
We're just two people sitting at a bar.

12:53.468 --> 12:55.969
Don't worry, I'll understand
if you can't keep up

12:55.970 --> 12:57.421
with the American girl.

13:08.942 --> 13:10.197
Mm-hmm.

13:10.198 --> 13:11.246
Hmm.

13:11.819 --> 13:12.713
I'll hold your jacket.

13:12.738 --> 13:14.072
No, it's fine, just take the picture.

13:14.073 --> 13:15.718
Just give it, it looks awkward.

13:18.368 --> 13:20.119
Okay.

13:20.873 --> 13:22.166
Uncross your arms.

13:24.251 --> 13:26.837
Come on, smile.

13:28.755 --> 13:30.882
It's not every day your boyfriend

13:30.883 --> 13:32.884
gets his first solo exhibition.

13:32.885 --> 13:35.262
Hashtag mindful moment.

13:35.885 --> 13:37.286
There.

13:38.056 --> 13:39.411
Now the bouncers will have to

13:39.436 --> 13:41.392
beat the crowd back tomorrow night.

13:43.353 --> 13:44.739
Can I have my jacket back now?

13:44.739 --> 13:47.733
Yes, let me just get my phone.

13:53.111 --> 13:54.154
Luc?

13:56.351 --> 13:57.893
It's just my emergency stash.

13:57.894 --> 13:59.187
Seriously?

13:59.395 --> 14:01.647
- That's what you're going with?
- You're hungry.

14:01.648 --> 14:02.537
Let's get you something to eat.

14:02.537 --> 14:03.683
Luc, you lied to me.

14:03.710 --> 14:05.461
I said I'd lay off.
I'm not using now, am I?

14:05.462 --> 14:07.181
I don't even care about the blow.

14:07.206 --> 14:09.172
You made me a promise, and you broke it.

14:09.172 --> 14:11.050
You Americans are so dramatic.

14:11.051 --> 14:12.468
Don't you turn this on me.

14:12.469 --> 14:13.798
My entire life has been

14:13.823 --> 14:15.769
flipped upside down and set on fire.

14:15.770 --> 14:16.758
And my life hasn't.

14:16.759 --> 14:18.389
I thought I could trust you.

14:19.186 --> 14:22.272
That... that you cared about me.

14:22.273 --> 14:23.348
Grace.

14:26.745 --> 14:28.488
If you can lie to me about that,

14:29.488 --> 14:31.118
then what else are you lying about?

14:36.608 --> 14:37.941
Oh, no, you're ruining them.

14:37.942 --> 14:39.026
No, right that's it.

14:39.027 --> 14:40.652
That is it.

14:43.656 --> 14:46.074
Try that.

14:46.075 --> 14:48.161
Vinegar and mayonnaise?

14:52.123 --> 14:53.582
That's genius.

14:54.501 --> 14:55.876
My dad gets credit for that one.

14:55.877 --> 14:57.919
He would never, ever eat his chips

14:57.920 --> 14:59.100
without vinegar...

14:59.637 --> 15:00.656
and mayo.

15:01.849 --> 15:03.584
Well, I guess he wasn't
all bad after all.

15:04.102 --> 15:06.225
You told me he was no prize.

15:07.939 --> 15:09.109
You remember that?

15:09.109 --> 15:11.109
I have a crazy good memory
for conversations.

15:11.110 --> 15:12.870
You do not want to get
in a fight with me,

15:12.870 --> 15:14.784
'cause I'll pull out crap
you said months ago,

15:14.785 --> 15:16.698
and recite it back to you
like a court reporter.

15:16.699 --> 15:19.021
I bet guys really dig that, right?

15:19.021 --> 15:19.943
Totally.

15:22.405 --> 15:24.193
So your dad taught you about fries.

15:25.450 --> 15:27.193
Excuse me... chips.

15:28.161 --> 15:29.525
What else?

15:29.525 --> 15:31.189
I guess you could say,

15:31.957 --> 15:33.800
he taught me what a hypocrite is.

15:33.801 --> 15:35.262
Yeah, he was always going on about

15:35.263 --> 15:36.395
how, um...

15:38.181 --> 15:39.402
... your word is your bond.

15:41.961 --> 15:45.291
And integrity is everything.

15:45.609 --> 15:48.528
Right up... I mean right up...
until that moment

15:48.553 --> 15:50.654
where he just left me
and my mum with nothing.

15:51.128 --> 15:53.379
You're right,
he does sound like a prize.

15:53.380 --> 15:54.378
Hmm, yeah.

15:54.932 --> 15:56.765
I guess some
of what he said sunk in.

15:58.888 --> 16:00.664
You seem like a man of integrity.

16:14.394 --> 16:15.770
I'm sorry, um...

16:17.311 --> 16:19.162
I was gonna do a whole thing here.

16:19.813 --> 16:21.731
Try to flirt some information out of you

16:21.732 --> 16:23.483
about the Molly Ryan investigation.

16:23.484 --> 16:26.161
Yeah, I wondered when we were
going to come to that.

16:26.162 --> 16:28.303
- It was that obvious?
- No, you were smooth.

16:28.328 --> 16:31.200
You were really smooth,
but, I mean, you know,

16:31.201 --> 16:33.717
all the bars in London,
and you just happened

16:33.851 --> 16:35.519
to walk into the one
right across the road

16:35.520 --> 16:36.902
from New Scotland Yard?

16:37.063 --> 16:38.748
So let me just ask you straight out.

16:39.398 --> 16:40.815
Why do you have a team of investigators

16:40.816 --> 16:42.221
following my sister?

16:42.485 --> 16:44.326
Okay, those guys, they work
for the crown prosecutor.

16:44.327 --> 16:45.649
- They're not mine.
- So this is

16:45.674 --> 16:47.607
Gwendolyn Hall's personal witch hunt?

16:47.607 --> 16:50.326
Whoa, I never said that.
Nobody's on a witch hunt here.

16:50.327 --> 16:51.993
Sitting across from her this morning,

16:51.994 --> 16:52.943
it felt pretty personal.

16:52.968 --> 16:54.678
What does she have against my sister?

16:54.922 --> 16:57.215
Gwen, she's just...

16:57.216 --> 16:59.718
She takes her job
very seriously, you know?

16:59.719 --> 17:01.136
As I'm sure you do.

17:01.137 --> 17:04.056
And... I need to get back to work.

17:04.057 --> 17:07.351
And I will see you... around.

17:10.434 --> 17:11.685
Our way of life.

17:11.685 --> 17:13.688
Our lives themselves.

17:13.688 --> 17:17.935
The brave soldiers
who made the ultimate sacrifice

17:18.401 --> 17:19.470
for this great nation.

17:20.027 --> 17:24.156
On behalf of the queen,
I dedicate this beautiful park

17:24.156 --> 17:25.574
as a living monument

17:25.690 --> 17:26.744
to their selfless,

17:27.867 --> 17:29.626
heroic actions.

17:44.552 --> 17:45.830
Did our friend deliver?

17:45.855 --> 17:47.113
He did.

17:47.114 --> 17:47.961
But he's proving to be

17:47.962 --> 17:51.176
slightly more rebellious
than we'd hoped.

17:51.731 --> 17:53.233
You misjudged him.

17:54.479 --> 17:55.497
Didn't you?

17:56.689 --> 17:58.906
You said we could control him.

17:59.719 --> 18:02.220
But now there's yet one more person

18:02.221 --> 18:03.345
who can ruin me.

18:03.346 --> 18:05.347
Don't worry, Your Highness.

18:05.348 --> 18:08.185
He just needs to be properly motivated.

18:08.384 --> 18:10.108
See to it.

18:32.432 --> 18:33.933
Oh, my God.

18:37.479 --> 18:39.361
Hey.

18:40.774 --> 18:41.816
What's the matter?

18:41.817 --> 18:43.067
Have you been crying?

18:43.068 --> 18:44.646
Luc and I got into it.

18:44.646 --> 18:47.029
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Are you sure?

18:47.030 --> 18:48.532
What are you doing?

18:49.950 --> 18:51.180
Oh, I'm just, uh,

18:51.180 --> 18:52.545
finishing up some research for work.

18:52.759 --> 18:54.843
I think I found what I need.

18:55.842 --> 18:56.844
It's him.

18:57.113 --> 18:58.946
He's actually calling?

18:58.947 --> 19:00.783
Not texting?

19:00.783 --> 19:02.742
He must be really sorry.

19:02.743 --> 19:06.287
Yeah, well he should be.

19:06.288 --> 19:08.331
Grace, before I met you,

19:08.332 --> 19:10.865
no one had ever looked at my art.

19:11.273 --> 19:13.930
Had ever looked at me as if I mattered.

19:15.300 --> 19:18.218
I love you, baby,
and I will do whatever it takes

19:18.243 --> 19:19.751
to make you trust me again.

19:22.137 --> 19:24.506
I've been working on a surprise for you.

19:25.198 --> 19:28.698
But you can only get it if you
come to the show tomorrow.

19:41.141 --> 19:42.517
Comfortable, eh?

19:42.518 --> 19:43.768
D. S. Bruno?

19:43.769 --> 19:45.019
Yeah.

19:45.020 --> 19:46.313
We're with Internal Affairs.

19:47.257 --> 19:48.175
Mind if we have a chat?

19:50.241 --> 19:52.367
Sure, want to take me in a box?

19:52.368 --> 19:53.826
No need.

19:53.828 --> 19:55.246
We're simply doing a department audit

19:55.247 --> 19:56.623
of the Donovan Trimbly case.

19:58.250 --> 19:59.822
Oh, yeah, yeah.

20:00.669 --> 20:02.510
- There a problem?
- Hopefully not.

20:03.046 --> 20:05.214
Just need you to take a look
at your evidence reports.

20:05.215 --> 20:08.342
Make sure you've crossed
all the "T"s, dotted the "I"s.

20:08.343 --> 20:10.344
So nothing comes back
to bite the department.

20:10.345 --> 20:11.894
Can you review it by day's end?

20:14.724 --> 20:16.101
Yeah, sure.

20:32.675 --> 20:34.675
_

21:06.719 --> 21:07.969
You're Roz, right?

21:07.970 --> 21:09.722
Yeah.

21:12.934 --> 21:14.976
You're the last person
I expected to see tonight.

21:14.977 --> 21:16.061
If anyone asks, you didn't see me.

21:16.062 --> 21:17.896
I'm not supposed
to be in London anymore.

21:17.897 --> 21:19.898
- What did you do?
- A load of nothing.

21:19.899 --> 21:22.817
Put it this way, I'm no closer
to finding out who killed Molly.

21:22.818 --> 21:24.569
Police have got jack-all on this,

21:24.570 --> 21:26.279
and you think you're going
to solve it yourself. How?

21:26.280 --> 21:28.531
If Molly's friends
were anything like Molly,

21:28.532 --> 21:30.951
they don't go telling everything
they know to the police.

21:30.952 --> 21:33.286
Like I bet that you know
who she was shagging, don't you?

21:33.287 --> 21:34.996
No. Molly was away from home

21:34.997 --> 21:36.873
for the first time in her life,
she wasn't exactly going steady.

21:36.874 --> 21:38.034
What about the night she died?

21:38.035 --> 21:39.602
She was here. Was anybody bothering her?

21:39.627 --> 21:41.698
Not that I saw, but I was working.

21:47.195 --> 21:48.488
It was Molly's.

21:50.406 --> 21:51.959
You got to know something.

21:52.492 --> 21:53.492
You're her roommate.

21:53.493 --> 21:54.500
Look, I wish I could help.

21:54.501 --> 21:56.047
I don't have a clue who did this.

21:56.048 --> 21:58.221
Whoever killed her
deserves to rot in hell.

22:35.423 --> 22:37.504
I'm sorry, Molly.

23:09.748 --> 23:11.332
You keep dancing like that,

23:11.333 --> 23:13.502
people are gonna think
this music is good.

23:14.273 --> 23:16.065
Is that an Irish brogue I hear?

23:16.066 --> 23:17.272
Belfast.

23:17.776 --> 23:18.901
I'm from Hillsborough.

23:18.902 --> 23:20.611
I wish I'd spent more time

23:20.612 --> 23:21.821
getting to know my neighbors.

23:21.822 --> 23:23.197
Did you ever go skinny dipping

23:23.198 --> 23:24.348
at that hole in Ballyskeagh?

23:24.349 --> 23:26.768
I still have a scar from the bloody
barbed wire fence.

23:26.769 --> 23:28.036
There you are!

23:30.038 --> 23:31.664
Ah.

23:31.665 --> 23:33.544
- Slainte.
- Slainte.

23:40.517 --> 23:41.935
I like your necklace.

23:42.727 --> 23:44.186
I knew a girl

23:44.187 --> 23:45.270
who had one just like it.

23:45.271 --> 23:47.807
Oh, did you now?

23:48.525 --> 23:50.192
And did you, um,

23:50.193 --> 23:52.737
- get along well with her?
- Well enough.

23:54.482 --> 23:55.816
She was my sister.

23:57.932 --> 24:00.142
Your sister had... this necklace?

24:00.143 --> 24:01.435
Yes, she did.

24:02.107 --> 24:03.271
Ah.

24:06.837 --> 24:08.082
What's it mean?

24:08.588 --> 24:10.256
- We got to go.
- Um, I have-I have to go, sorry.

24:10.257 --> 24:11.465
Wait, just... can't it wait?

24:11.466 --> 24:13.801
- I just want to talk.
- I can't.

24:13.802 --> 24:15.846
- Tell me about the necklace.
- I'm sorry.

24:31.204 --> 24:33.372
Good morning, I was hoping
I could have a word with you.

24:33.373 --> 24:37.334
I don't remember seeing
your name on my calendar.

24:37.335 --> 24:40.170
I just want to say I know
the pressure you're under

24:40.171 --> 24:42.339
with such a high profile case.

24:42.340 --> 24:43.799
I'm sure you just want
to get this right.

24:43.800 --> 24:46.093
That's why it'd be a shame if...

24:46.094 --> 24:48.220
with everyone's eyes on you,
you got this all wrong

24:48.221 --> 24:50.180
because of your bias against my sister.

24:50.181 --> 24:51.378
Bias.

24:53.602 --> 24:55.436
What could I possibly
have against your sister?

24:55.437 --> 24:56.622
I don't even know her.

24:56.623 --> 24:58.634
No, you don't.

24:59.063 --> 25:00.711
But you think you do,

25:01.107 --> 25:03.234
because of what happened
at Ashington Prep.

25:05.720 --> 25:07.096
You were a scholarship student

25:07.097 --> 25:08.692
at that fancy boarding school.

25:09.140 --> 25:10.808
You must have been desperate to fit in.

25:10.809 --> 25:13.143
Is that why you didn't stop
those rich girls

25:13.144 --> 25:15.646
from dragging poor Jenna Dale
into the woods

25:15.647 --> 25:16.814
and beating her to death?

25:16.815 --> 25:18.273
I want you to leave this office.

25:18.274 --> 25:19.608
- Right now.
- I understand,

25:19.609 --> 25:21.610
Gwendolyn... you were young,
and you tried

25:21.611 --> 25:24.279
to make it right by telling
the police what you saw,

25:24.280 --> 25:25.698
but those girls' parents
used their influence

25:25.699 --> 25:27.616
to make the whole thing go away,
and now you think

25:27.617 --> 25:28.994
my sister and I
are doing the same thing.

25:28.995 --> 25:30.160
Aren't you?

25:30.161 --> 25:31.300
I'm not Stan.

25:31.407 --> 25:33.367
I'm not going to threaten you
with malicious prosecution

25:33.368 --> 25:35.202
or some smear campaign in the press,

25:35.203 --> 25:37.079
but if you continue to pursue
Grace to the exclusion

25:37.080 --> 25:38.663
of all other suspects,

25:38.664 --> 25:40.665
I'll do whatever I have to do
to protect my sister,

25:40.666 --> 25:42.042
and I won't stop until she's

25:42.043 --> 25:43.126
- safe and sound.
- Not a day goes by

25:43.127 --> 25:44.544
when I don't think about Jenna.

25:44.545 --> 25:45.587
That I don't wish I'd done something

25:45.588 --> 25:46.547
to stop those girls.

25:46.548 --> 25:48.131
It's why I became a prosecutor,

25:48.132 --> 25:49.800
and I will never let another injustice

25:49.801 --> 25:51.426
go unpunished on my watch.

25:51.427 --> 25:52.762
Never.

25:57.475 --> 25:59.423
You know what? Maybe you're right.

26:01.104 --> 26:03.188
Maybe I have let my past
cloud my judgment

26:03.189 --> 26:04.940
when it comes to your sister,

26:04.941 --> 26:07.692
but you have to admit that there
are some objective facts

26:07.693 --> 26:09.504
that look really bad for Grace.

26:10.905 --> 26:12.030
Maybe she has some great explanations

26:12.031 --> 26:13.114
that will clear everything up,

26:13.115 --> 26:14.366
but I haven't heard them

26:14.367 --> 26:15.742
because she's been hiding

26:15.743 --> 26:17.285
behind Stan Gutterie.

26:17.286 --> 26:18.411
If this was your case,

26:18.412 --> 26:19.341
would you, honestly,

26:19.342 --> 26:20.942
clear her without speaking to her first?

26:20.943 --> 26:22.833
Would you let her leave the country?

26:27.082 --> 26:28.332
Probably not.

26:28.333 --> 26:30.042
So how about this?

26:30.453 --> 26:31.836
You let me speak to Grace,

26:31.836 --> 26:33.545
and if I hear what I need to hear,

26:33.546 --> 26:34.714
you can take her home.

26:44.020 --> 26:45.160
What are you doing here?

26:45.161 --> 26:46.726
I wasn't done with our conversation.

26:46.727 --> 26:47.747
How did you even find me?

26:49.395 --> 26:51.694
I tracked you with my phone.

26:55.207 --> 26:56.457
You planted that on me last night.

26:56.838 --> 26:57.792
I didn't have time

26:57.793 --> 27:00.044
to think of a better idea.

27:00.045 --> 27:01.838
- I can't talk to you.
- Says who?

27:01.839 --> 27:03.631
That bouncer? Roz?

27:03.632 --> 27:05.508
I just want to know about the necklace,

27:05.509 --> 27:06.843
and then I'll get out of your hair.

27:06.844 --> 27:08.303
You got spooked

27:08.304 --> 27:09.846
when you heard my sister had it.

27:10.274 --> 27:11.150
Why?

27:11.640 --> 27:13.600
Some things are better
left unanswered, okay?

27:13.601 --> 27:14.851
I need to know.

27:14.852 --> 27:15.878
Whatever it is.

27:16.562 --> 27:18.280
My sister is dead.

27:18.792 --> 27:20.129
I wasn't there to protect her

27:20.130 --> 27:21.204
from the bastard who butchered her,

27:21.205 --> 27:22.541
and I have to live with that.

27:24.687 --> 27:26.253
All I want now are some answers.

27:27.207 --> 27:29.065
So I can get Molly some justice.

27:29.066 --> 27:30.367
So I can get her some peace.

27:31.887 --> 27:33.022
Please.

27:38.242 --> 27:40.852
The necklace is from
a place where we work.

27:42.608 --> 27:44.011
A special club...

27:44.943 --> 27:47.034
where anyone with enough money can...

27:47.654 --> 27:49.489
have whatever they want.

27:50.699 --> 27:51.675
No.

27:53.619 --> 27:55.078
No, you're lying.

28:04.272 --> 28:05.791
You're lying. She wasn't...

28:06.400 --> 28:07.470
She'd never.

28:12.239 --> 28:13.600
She was a good girl.

28:14.712 --> 28:16.671
It doesn't make her a bad person.

28:16.917 --> 28:18.299
Okay, it's just something she did.

28:18.912 --> 28:21.330
And it's a lovely place,
and we make really good money,

28:21.331 --> 28:23.165
and they take really good care of us.

28:23.166 --> 28:24.209
Stop it.

28:26.159 --> 28:28.244
She was nothing like you.

28:46.974 --> 28:48.474
I'm not doing it.

28:48.475 --> 28:49.600
Would you just listen to me?

28:49.601 --> 28:50.810
You've never been a murder suspect.

28:50.811 --> 28:51.894
Settle down, ladies.

28:51.895 --> 28:53.771
You have no idea what it's like

28:53.772 --> 28:55.106
to be on the other side of that table.

28:55.107 --> 28:56.399
Twisting everything you're saying.

28:56.400 --> 28:57.692
Trying to trip you up.

28:57.693 --> 28:59.486
I'm not going back in there.

29:06.618 --> 29:07.792
You're right.

29:09.692 --> 29:11.068
I have no idea

29:11.069 --> 29:12.407
what that must feel like.

29:12.987 --> 29:16.114
But you have to know
I wouldn't ask you to do this

29:16.115 --> 29:18.166
if I didn't think it would
set you free once and for all.

29:18.493 --> 29:20.285
Allow us to finally go home.

29:20.671 --> 29:22.914
You never want me to talk to anyone

29:22.914 --> 29:23.865
about anything, ever.

29:24.665 --> 29:26.333
Tell her this is stupid.

29:26.334 --> 29:28.467
N-Normally I would tell you
to keep your mouth shut.

29:28.468 --> 29:29.923
You're on her side?

29:31.641 --> 29:32.951
I don't like
to live in the dark, you know?

29:33.627 --> 29:34.472
My guess is Gwendolyn

29:34.473 --> 29:36.141
is cooking something up.

29:36.813 --> 29:39.065
I like to look at the menu
before I get the bill.

29:40.316 --> 29:43.235
But don't worry, unlike
your last round in the ring,

29:43.236 --> 29:45.234
I'm gonna be in your corner this time.

29:54.167 --> 29:56.151
Oh, working half-day now?

29:56.669 --> 29:58.128
I had a late night.

29:58.129 --> 30:00.505
Ran down our second painter,
he's not our perp.

30:00.815 --> 30:02.883
He was away with his family in Brighton

30:02.884 --> 30:04.070
the night Molly Ryan was killed.

30:04.435 --> 30:07.221
Well, our mystery stalker
might be moot, anyway.

30:07.971 --> 30:10.349
Check out what came back
when you was having a lie-in.

30:11.714 --> 30:12.965
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

30:12.966 --> 30:14.967
Grace Atwood's coming in this afternoon

30:14.968 --> 30:16.093
to speak to Gwendolyn.

30:16.094 --> 30:17.135
Gwendolyn?

30:17.136 --> 30:18.307
What?

30:18.719 --> 30:20.095
This is our investigation.

30:20.096 --> 30:22.138
This... we should have
the first crack at her.

30:22.192 --> 30:23.734
Oh, believe me, I reminded her
that we haven't handed

30:23.735 --> 30:25.797
this case off
to the crown prosecutor, yet.

30:25.798 --> 30:27.488
But Gwen said she was the one

30:27.489 --> 30:29.407
who sweet-talked the sister
into bringing her in.

30:29.408 --> 30:33.161
And we already had our crack
at Grace, and we got nowhere.

30:33.162 --> 30:35.163
Well, you know what, maybe
if we'd had this bombshell,

30:35.164 --> 30:36.714
it would have been a different story.

30:38.750 --> 30:42.295
I didn't care
about Professor Linley anymore.

30:42.296 --> 30:45.423
By that time, I was
already dating Luc, anyway.

30:45.424 --> 30:47.675
Luc, that's right.

30:47.676 --> 30:49.510
Seems like
you're pretty smitten with him.

30:49.511 --> 30:51.429
Are there any questions here,

30:51.430 --> 30:53.306
or are you just hungry
for a little girl talk?

30:53.307 --> 30:55.434
Just an observation.

30:56.727 --> 30:58.102
I love Luc,

30:58.103 --> 30:59.322
if that's what you mean.

30:59.323 --> 31:00.638
Okay, then.

31:04.276 --> 31:05.578
I don't mean to be callous,

31:05.579 --> 31:08.756
but we have a video of Luc
and Molly, from the night

31:08.757 --> 31:11.074
- that she was killed.
- The lap dance.

31:12.284 --> 31:13.379
Yeah, I know about it.

31:13.786 --> 31:14.862
It was nothing.

31:14.863 --> 31:16.996
It was just Molly being silly

31:16.997 --> 31:18.456
and Luc playing along.

31:18.457 --> 31:21.753
So, you and Molly
never fought about Luc?

31:21.754 --> 31:23.435
- Nope.
- Not that night?

31:23.436 --> 31:24.375
Not ever.

31:24.376 --> 31:25.303
She's painting her

31:25.304 --> 31:26.063
into a corner.

31:26.123 --> 31:27.624
Did you and Molly fight

31:27.625 --> 31:29.042
about anything that night?

31:29.043 --> 31:30.836
No, I swear.

31:30.837 --> 31:32.087
We never fought.

31:32.088 --> 31:33.296
Then why did Molly

31:33.297 --> 31:35.841
have your blood and skin cells

31:35.842 --> 31:37.426
under her fingernails?

31:38.531 --> 31:40.658
There are a million reasons
why Grace's DNA

31:40.659 --> 31:42.576
could've been under Molly's nails.

31:42.578 --> 31:44.120
There aren't a million
reasons why Grace's blood

31:44.121 --> 31:46.499
was under Molly's nails.

31:47.833 --> 31:48.875
There's only one reason

31:48.876 --> 31:50.523
that I can see, Molly fought back

31:50.524 --> 31:52.408
when you came after her with that knife.

31:52.409 --> 31:54.216
When you were killing her.

31:54.241 --> 31:55.104
We're done.

31:55.171 --> 31:56.587
You've had your fun.

31:56.588 --> 31:57.796
Come on. Get up.

31:57.797 --> 31:59.007
Let's go.

32:00.609 --> 32:01.901
Grace.

32:02.135 --> 32:03.385
- No, I...
- Shut up.

32:03.386 --> 32:05.068
Not another word. Let's go.

32:05.763 --> 32:07.514
Grace, Stan's right.

32:07.515 --> 32:08.958
You want to tell
your side of the story,

32:08.959 --> 32:10.309
clear your name.

32:10.560 --> 32:11.900
I'm listening, Grace.

32:11.925 --> 32:13.427
Talk to me.

32:21.362 --> 32:23.234
Grace, come on.

32:23.740 --> 32:24.907
We're going.

32:24.908 --> 32:25.949
- Come on.
- No.

32:25.950 --> 32:27.267
You both made me come here,

32:27.268 --> 32:28.255
just let me talk.

32:31.885 --> 32:34.095
I didn't do anything wrong.

32:40.102 --> 32:41.603
It's not what you think.

32:41.604 --> 32:44.167
Then by all means, illuminate me.

32:53.241 --> 32:54.659
Earlier that night...

32:56.219 --> 32:57.929
... the night Molly died...

33:00.343 --> 33:02.542
... Molly pierced my belly button.

33:04.946 --> 33:06.905
You're quick on your feet, aren't you?

33:06.906 --> 33:07.992
I'm not lying.

33:08.366 --> 33:09.867
I have proof.

33:27.637 --> 33:29.388
Did you see her?!

33:29.389 --> 33:32.599
Flashing her belly button
like it was spring break.

33:32.600 --> 33:34.915
That girl thinks she's entitled
to get away with murder!

33:34.916 --> 33:37.555
I think she had a pretty
solid explanation, Gwen.

33:37.556 --> 33:39.148
A little too solid.

33:39.149 --> 33:40.774
You know, she...

33:40.775 --> 33:42.016
she must've known why
we were bringing her in.

33:42.017 --> 33:44.278
Went out, got a piercing
to cover her tracks, but how?

33:44.279 --> 33:45.654
How did she know?

33:45.655 --> 33:47.615
How did she know?

33:50.493 --> 33:51.536
You.

33:54.164 --> 33:56.416
You tipped off the sister, didn't you?

33:59.467 --> 34:01.016
We've all had a long day,

34:01.678 --> 34:04.388
so I'm gonna pretend you didn't
just question my integrity.

34:04.389 --> 34:06.766
I saw you with her yesterday at lunch.

34:07.667 --> 34:09.793
You two looked pretty cozy.

34:09.793 --> 34:12.621
Okay, that is called working a source.

34:12.623 --> 34:14.672
All right? And this whole thing,
this is total bull...

34:14.674 --> 34:16.424
Then look me in the eye
and tell me that your handling

34:16.425 --> 34:18.009
of this case has been
completely above board.

34:18.010 --> 34:21.554
I want to... I want to catch
Molly Ryan's killer

34:21.554 --> 34:23.181
just as much as you do.

34:24.766 --> 34:26.935
I don't know what's
going on with you, Alex,

34:26.936 --> 34:28.061
but I cannot let it

34:28.062 --> 34:29.228
affect this case.

34:29.230 --> 34:30.688
I'm sorry.

34:30.690 --> 34:31.773
You're off the investigation.

34:31.774 --> 34:32.815
Whoa, you can't do that.

34:32.817 --> 34:35.110
This is... this is my case.

34:35.110 --> 34:37.237
No, this is my case.

34:37.237 --> 34:38.850
The detectives who work it serve

34:38.851 --> 34:40.616
under the discretion
of the crown prosecution,

34:40.617 --> 34:42.994
and I no longer require your services.

35:24.755 --> 35:26.420
I'm gonna go get a drink.

35:35.137 --> 35:36.804
I was afraid you wouldn't make it.

35:36.805 --> 35:38.686
Where's my surprise?

35:39.182 --> 35:40.803
Is that the only reason you came?

35:40.804 --> 35:41.910
Maybe.

35:42.530 --> 35:44.365
Oh, then I guess
you better come with me.

35:55.251 --> 35:56.586
You ready?

35:58.796 --> 35:59.796
Go on.

35:59.797 --> 36:00.797
You sure?

36:00.798 --> 36:02.008
Yeah.

36:15.891 --> 36:17.058
I love it.

36:24.624 --> 36:26.333
I owe all of this to you.

36:26.334 --> 36:29.485
I'm sorry I wasn't here
at the start of the show.

36:29.505 --> 36:30.547
I was stuck at the police station.

36:30.548 --> 36:32.483
Why? What do they want now?

36:32.484 --> 36:35.173
They found my blood
under Molly's fingernails.

36:35.174 --> 36:37.857
I know. I freaked too.

36:38.918 --> 36:40.515
Thank God I remembered
Molly gave me that piercing

36:40.516 --> 36:41.892
earlier that night.

36:43.512 --> 36:44.929
That was that evening?

36:45.359 --> 36:46.831
I showed it to you

36:47.308 --> 36:49.432
for the first time
on the roof, remember?

36:49.810 --> 36:51.423
Oh, yeah.

36:59.870 --> 37:01.087
Whiskey straight.

37:01.947 --> 37:04.199
You here to ambush my sister, too?

37:07.411 --> 37:09.954
I'm just here for the free drink,

37:09.955 --> 37:11.789
and Luc's bold use of blue.

37:11.790 --> 37:12.832
Sorry, I can't really do

37:12.833 --> 37:14.299
chitchat right now.

37:14.324 --> 37:15.483
Just want to get drunk.

37:15.677 --> 37:18.180
Forget that I let Gwen
play me like a rookie today.

37:20.933 --> 37:22.391
And you,

37:22.392 --> 37:24.784
really thought I was better
at reading people,

37:25.270 --> 37:26.729
you're a tricky one, aren't you?

37:27.468 --> 37:29.148
Going on about what a hypocrite

37:29.149 --> 37:30.983
your dad was, while you're
planning to sucker punch

37:30.984 --> 37:32.069
my little sister.

37:34.154 --> 37:36.364
You came to that bar,
to pump me for information,

37:36.365 --> 37:37.698
but I'm the tricky one.

37:38.198 --> 37:39.909
You know, I'd like to think that

37:39.910 --> 37:42.286
I'm still a solid enough cop
that I wouldn't have blabbed

37:42.287 --> 37:44.121
about the DNA evidence, but the fact is

37:44.122 --> 37:45.790
I didn't even know at that point.

37:45.791 --> 37:48.356
And know we will never know
whether I would've been able

37:48.357 --> 37:50.336
to resist your charms because I am now

37:50.337 --> 37:53.365
officially off the Molly Ryan
murder investigation.

37:53.366 --> 37:54.618
Cheers.

37:55.805 --> 37:57.414
You're off the case?

37:58.178 --> 37:59.512
What happened?

37:59.513 --> 38:00.373
Gwen.

38:01.473 --> 38:03.060
- She kicked me off.
- What?

38:03.061 --> 38:04.299
Why?

38:04.300 --> 38:05.979
She's convinced that I am no longer...

38:07.633 --> 38:09.384
impartial in the case.

38:09.385 --> 38:10.302
And why is that?

38:13.097 --> 38:14.682
She thinks I got feelings for you.

38:18.317 --> 38:20.068
Why would she think that?

38:20.096 --> 38:21.347
Maybe...

38:23.232 --> 38:24.984
... maybe because I do.

38:31.198 --> 38:32.783
Do you want to get out of here?

38:41.125 --> 38:42.459
Congrats, Luc.

38:42.460 --> 38:43.483
Hey.

38:44.336 --> 38:45.879
There you go, lovely.

38:45.880 --> 38:47.448
Well, the turn-out's
mostly to do with Molly.

38:47.449 --> 38:48.309
I know that.

38:48.310 --> 38:50.376
Well, you're talented, Luc.

38:50.377 --> 38:52.802
Everyone can see it.

38:52.803 --> 38:53.596
Well,

38:53.597 --> 38:54.825
- thanks.
- Luc.

38:55.598 --> 38:57.140
Really?

38:57.141 --> 38:58.762
After what you said, you just walk up

38:58.763 --> 39:00.442
to my boyfriend's art show
like it's nothing?

39:00.467 --> 39:02.521
Luc and I were friends long
before you came to town.

39:02.522 --> 39:04.241
You said it was my fault Molly was dead.

39:04.268 --> 39:06.060
And I thought you were
saying it was my fault,

39:06.062 --> 39:07.354
and I couldn't go there.

39:07.842 --> 39:08.917
So I harshed you.

39:10.451 --> 39:11.459
But you're right.

39:11.940 --> 39:13.320
I'm sorry.

39:21.119 --> 39:22.411
I miss her so much.

39:23.056 --> 39:24.360
Me too.

39:37.969 --> 39:39.345
Hey, Luc.

39:39.346 --> 39:40.936
Luc.

39:41.306 --> 39:43.474
Can you hook me up with some blow?

39:45.769 --> 39:46.978
Huh?

39:54.110 --> 39:55.237
Here, take this.

39:56.154 --> 39:57.488
I don't want it.

39:57.489 --> 39:58.727
How much?

39:58.728 --> 40:00.196
No, it's okay.

40:01.326 --> 40:03.536
At least... take a few quid.

40:14.130 --> 40:15.631
What the hell?

40:15.632 --> 40:17.259
- It's okay.
- You're under arrest.
