<i>It seems today that all you see</i>
<i>Is violence in movies and sex on TV</i>

00:08.217 --> 00:11.845
<i>But where are those</i>
<i>Good old-fashioned values</i>

00:12.137 --> 00:15.057
<i>On which we used to rely?</i>

00:15.140 --> 00:18.435
<i>Lucky there's a family guy</i>

00:18.519 --> 00:21.813
<i>Lucky there's a man who</i>
<i>Positively can do</i>

00:21.897 --> 00:23.273
<i>All the things that make us</i>

00:23.357 --> 00:24.691
<i>Laugh and cry!</i>

00:24.775 --> 00:30.030
<i>He's a family guy!</i>

00:35.285 --> 00:37.120
<i>It's that time of year again.</i>

00:37.204 --> 00:39.206
<i>Are you a New England dirtbag</i>
<i>who wants to run with bulls,</i>

00:39.289 --> 00:41.667
<i>but thinks Spain is gay?</i>

00:41.750 --> 00:43.794
<i>Then don't miss</i>
<i>the Seriously Wicked Bull Run</i>

00:43.877 --> 00:45.671
<i>in South Attleboro, Mass!</i>

00:45.754 --> 00:48.048
<i>You and your friends can run</i>
<i>from a bunch of live bulls,</i>

00:48.131 --> 00:51.093
<i>and lots of times, there's</i>
<i>a chick whose boob comes out!</i>

00:51.176 --> 00:52.970
<i>Order your tickets before it's too late!</i>

00:55.889 --> 00:57.224
<i>Toilets limited.</i>

00:57.307 --> 00:58.725
Wow, that seems pretty cool.

00:58.809 --> 01:00.102
I don't know.

01:00.185 --> 01:01.270
Seems pretty lame to me.

01:01.353 --> 01:03.272
- Yeah, waste of time.
- I agree.

01:03.355 --> 01:04.690
Hey, Joe, isn't this your round?

01:04.773 --> 01:06.108
Sure, I'll wheel over to the bar

01:06.191 --> 01:09.444
and bring back your beers
one-by-one in my lap.

01:09.528 --> 01:11.238
You guys, we are so doing that bull run!

01:11.321 --> 01:12.865
Buying the tickets as we speak!

01:12.948 --> 01:14.241
But we can't tell Joe.

01:14.324 --> 01:15.868
Of course not, he'll be dead weight.

01:15.951 --> 01:17.953
You can't do a bull run
with a guy in a wheelchair.

01:18.036 --> 01:20.330
Yeah, this is for athletes.

01:25.794 --> 01:28.130
Just the regular wash, please.

01:28.213 --> 01:31.175
And, uh, I'm supposed to mention
that I saw you on LivingSocial?

01:31.258 --> 01:34.219
Was that worth it?
Was that worth the one dollar you saved?

01:34.303 --> 01:36.763
I'm sorry, we're not doing
that promotion anymore.

01:36.847 --> 01:37.890
Oh-ho!

01:37.973 --> 01:41.143
All the humiliation, none of the reward.

01:44.313 --> 01:47.649
You know, some people are okay
with the drive-through car wash.

01:47.733 --> 01:51.111
Me, I'm a fan of the hand job.
Hi, I'm Brian.

01:51.195 --> 01:52.946
Yes, I like to have fun with language.

01:53.030 --> 01:54.948
You're so funny.

01:55.032 --> 01:56.283
I'm Tori.

01:56.366 --> 01:57.534
I got hit by a car in high school,

01:57.618 --> 01:58.994
so I don't have to work.

01:59.077 --> 02:01.121
Cool. Hey, so what's your afternoon like?

02:01.205 --> 02:02.497
I don't have plans.

02:02.581 --> 02:05.167
Maybe we could grab lunch
and then see what happens.

02:05.250 --> 02:07.377
This will not end well.

02:07.461 --> 02:09.379
Like eating an artichoke.

02:09.463 --> 02:10.756
Good Lord!

02:10.839 --> 02:13.842
I ate nothing and I'm
soaking wet for some reason.

02:17.679 --> 02:19.556
So, you guys all pumped
to run with the bulls?

02:19.640 --> 02:21.558
You bet, this is gonna be
my first exercise

02:21.642 --> 02:23.560
since I chased that balloon.

02:23.644 --> 02:24.811
Hey, what's going on?

02:24.895 --> 02:26.021
Hey, Joe.

02:26.104 --> 02:28.190
We are competing...

02:28.273 --> 02:31.610
in the international Chef
Boyardee look-alike contest.

02:31.693 --> 02:33.612
Oh, well, where's your chef hat?

02:33.695 --> 02:35.113
You guys are gonna lose.

02:35.197 --> 02:36.406
Especially Cleveland.

02:36.490 --> 02:37.991
He's in the Cream of Wheat competition,

02:38.075 --> 02:39.326
which is down the street.

02:39.409 --> 02:41.036
We-we got to go now. We're very late.

02:41.119 --> 02:43.205
Well, this is funny, because...

02:43.288 --> 02:45.040
guess where I'm going.

02:45.123 --> 02:46.375
And I got the hat.

02:46.458 --> 02:47.835
You guys are dead!

02:47.918 --> 02:49.837
Look, Joe.

02:49.920 --> 02:51.755
We didn't want to tell
you, but we're going

02:51.839 --> 02:53.340
to the Seriously Wicked Bull Run.

02:53.423 --> 02:56.176
We didn't invite you because we
didn't think you could keep up.

02:56.260 --> 02:59.263
Yeah, we thought it seemed
too dangerous for, uh,

02:59.346 --> 03:02.808
incapacitated, half-man,
shrivel-legged gimps.

03:02.891 --> 03:04.643
And we didn't want to hurt your feelings.

03:04.726 --> 03:07.145
Come on, my handicap
has never held me back.

03:07.229 --> 03:08.605
I'm coming with you guys.

03:08.689 --> 03:11.191
Joe, you peed in your bag
while you said that.

03:11.275 --> 03:13.193
Can you honestly say that you didn't pee

03:13.277 --> 03:16.238
just now while you were talking?

03:16.321 --> 03:18.240
Okay, you can come.

03:22.327 --> 03:24.997
Wow, that was amazing.

03:25.122 --> 03:26.373
Hey, uh, uh, just to be clear,

03:26.456 --> 03:27.875
I don't really think you're a whore.

03:27.958 --> 03:31.044
I-I just need to say that
to, you know, to finish.

03:31.128 --> 03:33.046
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.

03:33.130 --> 03:35.299
And obviously, I don't think
you're my Uncle Dale.

03:35.382 --> 03:37.551
- Good, good, same page.

03:37.634 --> 03:39.428
Oh, crap, my husband's home early.

03:39.511 --> 03:40.762
Wait a minute, you're married?

03:40.846 --> 03:42.014
And he's here? Now?

03:43.182 --> 03:44.183
Yeah, that's him.

03:44.266 --> 03:45.350
You've got to get out of here.

03:45.434 --> 03:46.852
He's really jealous.

03:46.935 --> 03:48.478
I think he's bitter because he never got

03:48.562 --> 03:51.273
the credit he deserved
for killing Osama bin Laden.

03:51.356 --> 03:53.358
Your husband's a Navy SEAL?

03:55.319 --> 03:56.695
What the hell is going on here?

03:56.778 --> 03:58.197
What is this?

03:59.948 --> 04:01.491
Ruff!

04:01.575 --> 04:03.493
You got a dog?

04:03.577 --> 04:04.995
Uh... yeah!

04:05.078 --> 04:07.331
I rescued him from the pound.

04:08.999 --> 04:10.834
Well, hey there, buddy.

04:10.918 --> 04:12.503
Wow, his nose is super wet!

04:12.586 --> 04:14.129
He must be healthy.

04:14.213 --> 04:17.049
Uh, and somebody's been
rooting in a sardine can.

04:17.132 --> 04:19.134
Well, I'm gonna grab a shower.

04:19.218 --> 04:21.053
Great, honey.

04:21.136 --> 04:23.514
Oh. Oh, my God, that was close.

04:23.597 --> 04:25.098
Yeah, but think about it.

04:25.182 --> 04:27.100
As long as he thinks you're our new pet,

04:27.184 --> 04:29.353
we can keep fooling
around behind his back.

04:29.436 --> 04:31.271
Huh, you're right.

04:31.355 --> 04:33.148
Wow, this could be an even better scam

04:33.232 --> 04:35.609
than that claw machine at the arcade.

04:36.818 --> 04:38.445
Damn it, this game is so stupid!

04:38.529 --> 04:41.907
It's impossible to do anything
with a dumb, crappy claw!

04:41.990 --> 04:44.326
Hey, that's mean, and it's not even true!

04:44.409 --> 04:46.119
I'm leaving!

04:46.203 --> 04:48.205
Dang it!

04:52.125 --> 04:53.335
You need a little help?

04:53.418 --> 04:55.420
No!

04:57.548 --> 05:00.425
If you could angle up the ring,
then I could kind of hook it.

05:04.388 --> 05:05.848
How do you drive?

05:05.931 --> 05:07.558
Bad!

05:18.652 --> 05:20.320
We clearly overdressed.

05:20.404 --> 05:22.364
They have the type of fat white woman here

05:22.447 --> 05:25.200
that not even I am interested in.

05:25.284 --> 05:26.410
<i>Ladies, gentlemen,</i>

05:26.493 --> 05:28.203
<i>and alternative high school graduates,</i>

05:28.287 --> 05:30.330
<i>get ready to run for your lives!</i>

05:38.255 --> 05:40.424
Aah! I shouldn't have worn high heels!

05:40.507 --> 05:41.758
Oh, stop it! You look great.

05:41.842 --> 05:44.678
Oh, well, I didn't want
all <i>this</i> attention.

05:46.305 --> 05:47.431
<i>Cleveland, why do you let them</i>

05:47.514 --> 05:48.932
<i>talk you into these things?</i>

05:49.016 --> 05:51.393
<i>This is how</i><i>people pleasers die!</i>

05:51.476 --> 05:54.396
Hey, guys, after this, let's beat
alligators with sticks or something.

05:54.479 --> 05:55.898
You read my mind!

05:55.981 --> 05:58.275
<i>We just talked about this!</i>

05:59.776 --> 06:01.486
This is amazing!

06:01.570 --> 06:03.697
I told you guys I could do it!

06:22.341 --> 06:25.844
Look... out...

06:25.928 --> 06:29.348
Joe!

07:08.929 --> 07:11.056
Joe, oh, my God!

07:11.139 --> 07:12.599
You all right?

07:12.683 --> 07:15.018
I can't feel anything below my neck!

07:15.102 --> 07:17.312
I can't move a muscle, guys!

07:17.396 --> 07:18.522
Oh, my God!

07:18.605 --> 07:20.899
Joe's completely paralyzed!

07:22.776 --> 07:23.819
Oop, that's me.

07:23.902 --> 07:25.112
That's unfortunate.

07:25.195 --> 07:26.613
That's Lois, hold on.

07:26.697 --> 07:28.699
Hey, babe.
Uh, good.

07:28.782 --> 07:30.117
Little hiccup, but fun.

07:39.877 --> 07:41.837
You guys!

07:41.920 --> 07:44.298
I've been trying to keep
my birthday a secret.

07:44.381 --> 07:46.508
No, Dr. Hartman, we're not
here for your birthday.

07:46.592 --> 07:47.718
We're here for Joe.

07:47.801 --> 07:48.927
Don't sugarcoat it, Doc.

07:49.011 --> 07:50.554
Just give it to me straight.

07:50.637 --> 07:52.598
Well, Mr. Swanson, I did
an exploratory procedure,

07:52.681 --> 07:54.808
which revealed extensive damage.

07:54.892 --> 07:57.936
Please, just tell me...
am I completely paralyzed?

07:58.020 --> 07:59.104
I'm afraid...

07:59.188 --> 08:00.480
of ghosts.

08:00.564 --> 08:01.732
And yes.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.108
Mr. Swanson has lost all movement,

08:03.192 --> 08:05.152
and will require around-the-clock care.

08:05.235 --> 08:06.945
Most of it disgusting.

08:07.029 --> 08:09.573
Oh, my God, Bonnie, I'm so sorry.

08:09.656 --> 08:11.116
If there's anything I can do...

08:11.200 --> 08:12.576
There actually is.

08:12.659 --> 08:14.494
Could you collect my mail forever?

08:14.578 --> 08:16.663
I'm leaving Joe and moving to Europe.

08:16.747 --> 08:18.749
I didn't sign up for this.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.918
Bonnie, wait! God, this is awful.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.753
What am I gonna do?

08:22.836 --> 08:24.963
Well, seems like you folks
have this all taken care of.

08:25.047 --> 08:26.965
- Surprise!

08:27.049 --> 08:29.301
Oh, you guys!

08:29.384 --> 08:30.677
Hey, don't go in that room back there.

08:30.761 --> 08:32.971
It's, like, super sad.

08:38.227 --> 08:40.938
Coming up, quintuplets
born at Quahog General.

08:41.021 --> 08:42.773
What? That's...

08:42.856 --> 08:44.525
Oh, that's supposed to be "burn"?

08:44.608 --> 08:48.487
Oh, coming up, quintuplets
burn at Quahog General.

08:49.655 --> 08:52.199
Hey, honey, get in here.

08:52.282 --> 08:54.618
Check this out... the way he's sitting,

08:54.701 --> 08:56.703
it looks like the dog's watching the news.

08:56.787 --> 08:59.498
You like watching the news, you dumb dog?

08:59.581 --> 09:02.417
Well, I'm off to do what
former Navy SEALs do...

09:02.501 --> 09:04.878
sell lawn mowers.

09:04.962 --> 09:06.880
Wow, he really has no idea.

09:06.964 --> 09:09.216
Hey, want to take a shower with me?

09:09.299 --> 09:10.801
Sure.

09:10.884 --> 09:12.511
Man, this is a pretty sweet gig.

09:12.594 --> 09:14.680
Like being a member of Daft Punk.

09:14.763 --> 09:16.932
Look at this old Casio keyboard

09:17.015 --> 09:19.226
from the 1980s that I have found.

09:19.309 --> 09:21.728
Watch what happens
when I push this demo button.

09:25.315 --> 09:26.692
Hello, Daft Punk?

09:26.775 --> 09:28.819
Great song. Here's a Grammy.

09:28.902 --> 09:30.404
Oh-ho-ho!

09:30.487 --> 09:31.655
You know, is funny.

09:31.738 --> 09:34.700
Until you spoke, I did
not know we were French!

09:38.120 --> 09:40.414
There you go, Joe. All settled.

09:40.497 --> 09:42.249
Now, which wall would you like to look at

09:42.332 --> 09:43.417
for the rest of your life?

09:43.500 --> 09:45.794
I don't know, maybe that one.

09:45.878 --> 09:47.629
I-I have no idea
what you're pointing at, Joe.

09:47.713 --> 09:49.006
You got to meet us halfway.

09:49.089 --> 09:50.966
Look, guys, I don't want
to be a burden to anyone.

09:51.049 --> 09:52.843
You go ahead and live your lives.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.428
I'll be fine.

09:54.511 --> 09:55.971
We can't just leave you, Joe.

09:56.054 --> 09:58.724
So before we go, I'm gonna
put the remote in your mouth.

09:58.807 --> 10:00.851
Here's a can of chili.

10:00.934 --> 10:04.062
And the opener we'll put... in your mouth.

10:04.146 --> 10:06.064
And here's a magazine I thought
you might like to read.

10:06.148 --> 10:07.608
I'm gonna put it in your mouth.

10:09.067 --> 10:10.944
You're a good friend, Peter.

10:11.028 --> 10:12.738
Joe, I just wish we could do more,

10:12.821 --> 10:15.407
but obviously your mouth is full.

10:15.490 --> 10:17.242
And you probably don't want
any reminders of Bonnie

10:17.326 --> 10:19.661
around the house, so I cleared
out all of her underwear.

10:19.745 --> 10:21.663
Okay, don't be a stranger.

10:21.747 --> 10:23.665
Yeah, 'cause we're not
supposed to talk to those.

10:23.749 --> 10:26.960
I don't know, I'm not sure
I feel right about leaving Joe.

10:27.044 --> 10:30.088
Doesn't seem like he's gonna be
able to take care of himself.

10:30.172 --> 10:32.090
Yeah, we're-we're kind of all he has now.

10:32.174 --> 10:33.217
What... Joe?

10:33.300 --> 10:34.301
What're you talking about?

10:34.384 --> 10:36.845
He's fine.

10:36.929 --> 10:39.306
Look, he's already watching
<i>The Price Is Right</i> in there.

10:39.389 --> 10:41.850
Oop, he's biting too hard on the volume.

10:46.688 --> 10:48.440
Okay, you can play over there
in the sandbox, honey.

10:48.524 --> 10:50.734
Mommy's just gonna read her book.

10:50.817 --> 10:52.653
Okay, I'm just gonna walk 30 feet away,

10:52.736 --> 10:55.072
and then panic because I can't see you.

10:55.155 --> 10:56.990
Can you fit me in at 10:00 tomorrow?

10:57.074 --> 10:58.700
It's getting a little long on the sides.

10:58.784 --> 11:00.869
Brian? What are you doing on a leash?

11:00.953 --> 11:02.329
And who's that?

11:02.412 --> 11:03.539
Be cool.

11:03.622 --> 11:04.790
This is the guy whose wife I'm banging.

11:04.873 --> 11:06.583
Oh, what a romantic way to put it.

11:06.708 --> 11:07.835
Yeah, it's great.

11:07.918 --> 11:10.712
I just pretend to be their dog,
and then when he leaves for work,

11:10.796 --> 11:14.341
I get to go to the <i>pound,</i>
if you know what I mean.

11:14.424 --> 11:15.884
God, Brian, you are such a scumbag.

11:15.968 --> 11:17.344
I can't believe you...

11:17.427 --> 11:19.429
Mommy! Mommy! Where's my mommy?

11:19.513 --> 11:21.139
I have no one and nothing!

11:21.223 --> 11:22.766
I'm right here, honey.

11:22.850 --> 11:23.934
Oh, thank God.

11:24.017 --> 11:26.728
She's such a gross hog.

11:30.732 --> 11:32.568
Joe, you can't just sit here.

11:32.651 --> 11:34.278
You need intellectual stimulation.

11:34.361 --> 11:36.280
So I brought something to read to you.

11:36.363 --> 11:39.157
It's the word search
from the <i>Sunday Circular.</i>

11:39.241 --> 11:40.784
"Kangaroo."

11:40.868 --> 11:43.078
Let's see if we can find that one.

11:43.161 --> 11:44.371
"Outback."

11:44.454 --> 11:46.248
I think it's an Australian theme.

11:46.331 --> 11:47.583
"Koala."

11:47.666 --> 11:49.042
It definitely is.

11:49.126 --> 11:50.752
Can't make out this one.

11:50.836 --> 11:52.754
"Abor... Aborgine...

11:52.838 --> 11:54.381
"Aborgina"?

11:54.464 --> 11:56.550
That's what they call eggplant down there.

11:56.633 --> 11:58.093
You know what? Forget this.

11:58.177 --> 12:00.304
I'll just read to you from <i>Jet.</i>

12:00.387 --> 12:02.598
Look, this whole page is
all the Wayans brothers

12:02.681 --> 12:04.600
sitting in different positions.

12:04.683 --> 12:07.102
How you suppose they come up
with all them positions?

12:07.186 --> 12:08.812
You could give me a million years.

12:08.896 --> 12:10.814
I just ain't wired that way.

12:10.898 --> 12:11.940
Marlon's like a rubber man.

12:12.024 --> 12:13.692
He can sit in any kind of way.

12:13.775 --> 12:16.403
Here's Keenan telling the
younger ones how to sit.

12:16.486 --> 12:17.821
Like they gonna listen.

12:17.905 --> 12:19.198
Damon's doing his own thing.

12:19.281 --> 12:20.407
No surprise there.

12:20.490 --> 12:21.700
That's Damon.

12:21.783 --> 12:23.118
You enjoying all this, Joe?

12:23.202 --> 12:24.870
I'm honestly just glad it seems

12:24.953 --> 12:27.080
like you have something you like.

12:32.294 --> 12:33.754
Hey, my laptop's out of battery.

12:33.837 --> 12:34.963
You want to have sex?

12:35.047 --> 12:37.883
Sure, I've almost finished
my sandwich, anyway.

12:39.635 --> 12:42.137
Oh, come on, I don't want
to have to watch this.

12:42.221 --> 12:43.847
Yeah, that's right.

12:43.931 --> 12:46.892
I was the only one
who didn't get to meet Biden.

12:46.975 --> 12:48.227
You know what?

12:48.310 --> 12:50.687
Screw this. I'm out of here.

12:53.482 --> 12:56.235
Ha! Skewered.

12:56.318 --> 12:57.819
Hey!

12:57.903 --> 12:59.029
Where do you think you're going?

12:59.112 --> 13:00.197
You're my dog.

13:00.280 --> 13:01.907
You're not going anywhere.

13:01.990 --> 13:03.242
Besides, I need you, boy.

13:03.325 --> 13:04.993
Now more than ever.

13:05.077 --> 13:07.371
I think my wife is cheating on me.

13:08.330 --> 13:10.374
<i>Hey, Tori, it's Brian.</i>

13:10.457 --> 13:11.917
<i>I'm getting the Chinese food for us.</i>

13:12.000 --> 13:14.628
<i>I think I'm gonna order</i>
<i>some Me Like Bang Ho.</i>

13:14.711 --> 13:16.839
<i>That's-that's not a real thing,</i>

13:16.922 --> 13:18.423
<i>I'm talking about sex.</i>

13:18.507 --> 13:20.551
<i>All right, I'll be there in five.</i>

13:20.634 --> 13:22.553
Man, when I find that son of a bitch,

13:22.636 --> 13:24.972
I'm gonna rip his head off.

13:26.557 --> 13:27.850
God, what a nightmare.

13:27.933 --> 13:30.853
That guy's even scarier
than a thesaurus-asaurus.

13:30.936 --> 13:33.814
Tread, stomp, trudge.

13:33.897 --> 13:36.191
Growl, roar, ululate.

13:36.275 --> 13:38.652
Antonym... whisper.

13:38.735 --> 13:39.862
What's wrong with him?

13:39.945 --> 13:41.822
- He's on the spectrum.
-"Spectrum"?

13:41.905 --> 13:45.117
In my day we'd throw him in the army
and have him play the bugle.

13:48.912 --> 13:51.081
Peter, this just isn't working.

13:51.164 --> 13:52.958
We can't take proper care of Joe.

13:53.041 --> 13:54.501
It's a huge amount of work

13:54.585 --> 13:55.711
and we don't have
any idea what we're doing.

13:55.794 --> 13:57.880
Quagmire's right. It's too much.

13:57.963 --> 14:02.176
I just think he'd be better off
under the care of grumpy, Filipino nurses.

14:02.301 --> 14:03.969
Yeah, that's why I looked into it,

14:04.052 --> 14:05.512
and we've reserved a place for him

14:05.596 --> 14:08.182
at the State Home for
Mentals and Bastards.

14:08.265 --> 14:12.019
Oh, my God, sometimes
they whip them with hoses...

14:12.102 --> 14:14.605
outside? This is perfect!

14:22.613 --> 14:25.866
Hi, I work here.

14:25.949 --> 14:27.534
I don't think this guy works here.

14:27.618 --> 14:28.702
Hi, can I help you?

14:28.785 --> 14:30.329
Yeah, this is Joe Swanson.

14:30.412 --> 14:32.581
We arranged for a 9:15 dump-off?

14:32.706 --> 14:34.249
Go on, guys, get out of here.

14:34.333 --> 14:35.959
I'll be fine.

14:36.043 --> 14:37.961
- Bye, Joe.
- Take care, man.

14:38.045 --> 14:40.047
See ya, Joe.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.008
Hold on, guys.

14:43.091 --> 14:46.136
There's one last thing
I got to say to my friend.

14:46.220 --> 14:48.972
Hey, Joe, you know
that movie you told me to watch

14:49.056 --> 14:50.766
that you said was
your favorite movie of all time,

14:50.891 --> 14:52.142
and you said I had to watch it?

14:52.226 --> 14:53.936
<i>Backdraft...</i> you finally watched it?

14:54.019 --> 14:55.437
Yeah. Wasn't it great?

14:55.521 --> 14:56.647
I thought it was stupid.

14:56.730 --> 14:58.065
Take care, Joe.

15:04.947 --> 15:08.242
You know, tha-that state home we
left Joe in didn't seem so bad.

15:08.325 --> 15:09.493
Yeah, it's got to be good.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.328
I mean, Napoleon Bonaparte was there.

15:11.411 --> 15:13.372
Would the French people
let their boss walk around

15:13.455 --> 15:14.957
in stained underwear,
trying to stab people

15:15.040 --> 15:17.000
if the place wasn't nice?

15:17.084 --> 15:18.335
Yeah, no, no,
y-you're right, you're right.

15:18.418 --> 15:19.711
Joe will get much better care there.

15:19.795 --> 15:21.380
I still feel bad.

15:21.463 --> 15:23.131
Come on, you guys. Joe's gonna be fine.

15:23.215 --> 15:24.383
He'll fit in great there.

15:24.466 --> 15:26.593
Not like when I went to Hogwarts.

15:26.677 --> 15:28.887
Slytherin.

15:30.556 --> 15:32.558
Hufflepuff.

15:34.184 --> 15:37.187
Housing for registered sex offenders!

15:37.271 --> 15:39.481
Aw.

15:46.071 --> 15:47.614
Oh, Tori, thank God.

15:47.698 --> 15:48.782
Listen, you got to unchain me.

15:48.866 --> 15:50.033
Look what Vic did.

15:50.117 --> 15:51.118
Tell me about it.

15:51.201 --> 15:52.619
He's lost his mind.

15:52.703 --> 15:54.746
That's why I'm gonna go stay
with my mother in Baltimore

15:54.830 --> 15:56.164
and work at her wife's bar.

15:56.248 --> 15:57.708
Wait, what?

15:57.791 --> 15:59.042
Tori, come back!

15:59.126 --> 16:00.169
Damn it!

16:00.252 --> 16:01.628
Wow, shocker.

16:01.712 --> 16:04.131
Your gross hookup
from the car wash ended poorly?

16:04.214 --> 16:06.091
Stewie, thank God!
How'd you find me?

16:06.175 --> 16:07.718
Well, you remember
when the vet knocked you out

16:07.801 --> 16:09.219
to take out that rotten tooth?

16:09.303 --> 16:10.971
He also put a tracking chip in your neck.

16:11.054 --> 16:13.307
What? That's a total
violation of my rights!

16:13.390 --> 16:15.767
Heh, I like how you're
chained up in a yard

16:15.851 --> 16:17.436
and still trying to pretend you're a guy.

16:17.519 --> 16:19.021
Look, you got to help me.

16:19.104 --> 16:20.981
Her husband's a maniac and the
only reason he hasn't killed me

16:21.064 --> 16:22.816
is because he thinks I'm just his pet dog.

16:22.900 --> 16:25.194
Hmm, he's got a padlock on here.

16:25.277 --> 16:26.778
But don't worry,
I'll figure something out.

16:26.862 --> 16:29.448
Well, hurry, 'cause I'm trapped
like a baseball announcer.

16:29.531 --> 16:31.116
<i>And the count is two and two.</i>

16:31.200 --> 16:33.660
<i>Garcia steps off the mound again,</i>

16:33.744 --> 16:35.412
<i>virtually guaranteeing that my wife</i>

16:35.495 --> 16:37.122
<i>will be asleep when I get home.</i>

16:37.206 --> 16:39.750
<i>The big right-hander kicks</i>
<i>a little dirt and tosses</i>

16:39.833 --> 16:42.211
<i>the rosin bag as my children</i>
<i>grow up without me.</i>

16:42.294 --> 16:44.546
<i>Okay, and now a fan in the</i>
<i>stands is giving me the finger.</i>

16:44.630 --> 16:45.881
<i>I agree.</i>

16:45.964 --> 16:47.049
<i>Hey, I don't know if you can hear it,</i>

16:47.132 --> 16:50.135
<i>but I'm peeing in my coffee cup right now.</i>

16:53.805 --> 16:55.057
There you are.

16:55.140 --> 16:56.642
Where the hell have you been?

16:56.725 --> 16:59.144
I got arrested for huckin'
a TV/VCR combo off the dam.

16:59.228 --> 17:01.063
Off the damn what?

17:01.146 --> 17:02.564
Off the damn overpass.

17:02.648 --> 17:04.149
Oh...

17:04.233 --> 17:05.234
God, I love you, Lois.

17:05.317 --> 17:06.777
That was like great sex.

17:06.860 --> 17:08.445
But seriously, it-it was bad.

17:08.529 --> 17:09.613
It hit a school bus.

17:09.696 --> 17:10.906
Oh, my God!

17:10.989 --> 17:12.449
Well-well, can you go talk to Joe?

17:12.533 --> 17:15.118
Maybe he can put in a word for
you down at the police station.

17:15.202 --> 17:18.080
Yeah, yeah, Joe, yeah, may...
yeah, maybe, maybe.

17:18.163 --> 17:20.123
Do you, uh, you-you want a back rub?

17:20.207 --> 17:22.084
Peter, what's going on?

17:22.167 --> 17:23.418
Uh, what do you mean?

17:23.502 --> 17:25.128
Whenever you offer me a back rub,

17:25.212 --> 17:27.047
it means you're hiding something.

17:33.554 --> 17:35.514
You, hey, you-you want a back rub?

17:35.597 --> 17:38.308
We may or may not have put Joe

17:38.392 --> 17:40.519
in a smelly home for the goofy.

17:40.602 --> 17:43.230
What? Peter, those places
are a horror show!

17:43.313 --> 17:44.439
Joe's your friend!

17:44.523 --> 17:46.149
How could you treat him like that?

17:46.233 --> 17:48.026
We just couldn't handle him
being fully paralyzed.

17:48.110 --> 17:49.528
We didn't know what else to do.

17:49.611 --> 17:50.946
But you're right.

17:51.029 --> 17:52.322
We got to get him out of there.

17:52.406 --> 17:54.157
You most certainly do.

17:54.241 --> 17:56.076
All right, how about that back rub now?

17:56.159 --> 17:58.620
What are you, nuts?

18:02.708 --> 18:04.751
What the hell do you want?

18:04.835 --> 18:06.128
Oh, hello, sir.

18:06.211 --> 18:07.713
I'm afraid there's been a mistake.

18:07.796 --> 18:11.341
I believe you found our dog,
and we need to take him home.

18:11.425 --> 18:12.926
No way! Get lost, kid.

18:13.010 --> 18:14.469
He's my dog now.

18:14.553 --> 18:16.638
Well, we figured you'd say no to us,

18:16.722 --> 18:19.224
but not to Vice President Joe Biden!

18:19.308 --> 18:20.934
Oh, my God!

18:21.018 --> 18:22.311
Mr. Vice President!

18:22.394 --> 18:23.896
First, I want to thank you, Vic,

18:23.979 --> 18:26.773
for shooting the guy
we said was Osama bin Laden.

18:26.857 --> 18:29.568
Second, give these kids their dog back.

18:29.651 --> 18:32.279
Of course, sir, I'm so sorry!

18:32.362 --> 18:33.780
Here, take him!

18:33.864 --> 18:35.199
Thank you.

18:35.282 --> 18:37.117
You're a great American.

18:37.201 --> 18:38.368
Thanks, Mr. Biden!

18:38.452 --> 18:39.703
No problem.

18:39.786 --> 18:41.288
Hey, you guys watch <i>Veep?</i>

18:41.371 --> 18:43.874
- No.
- Yeah, it's all fake.

18:43.957 --> 18:45.667
Yeah, we said no.

18:50.464 --> 18:52.466
Hi, uh, we're here to pick up Joe Swanson.

18:52.549 --> 18:53.800
Are you from the news?

18:53.884 --> 18:55.385
You have to tell us
if you're from the news.

18:55.469 --> 18:56.845
No, we're his friends.

18:56.970 --> 18:59.806
- What are you guys doing here?
- We came to bring you home, Joe.

18:59.890 --> 19:02.267
We're all really sorry we abandoned you.

19:02.351 --> 19:05.187
Yeah, we just kind of got
overwhelmed and all freaked out.

19:05.270 --> 19:07.189
But we're your friends, Joe.

19:07.272 --> 19:09.274
And we'll always be there
for you no matter what.

19:09.358 --> 19:10.984
Thanks, guys.

19:11.068 --> 19:13.612
I'd say let's get my stuff,
but it's all been stolen.

19:13.695 --> 19:16.365
That's okay.
Come on, let's go home.

19:16.448 --> 19:17.950
Sorry, no one gets out of here

19:18.033 --> 19:19.576
without a release from their doctor.

19:19.660 --> 19:22.829
All right, we'll just call him right now.

19:26.667 --> 19:28.669
What's that ringing?

19:32.339 --> 19:34.800
Joe, that ringing...
it's coming from your back!

19:34.883 --> 19:35.968
It is?

19:36.051 --> 19:37.219
Holy crap!

19:37.302 --> 19:39.388
Dr. Hartman must have
dropped his phone in Joe

19:39.471 --> 19:40.931
when he was looking at his spine!

19:41.014 --> 19:42.057
Oh, thank God.

19:42.140 --> 19:43.976
I've been hearing that ringing all week.

19:44.059 --> 19:45.310
I just thought I was losing my mind

19:45.394 --> 19:47.855
from lunatics screaming in my face.

19:47.938 --> 19:50.023
Your mother's a whore!

19:50.107 --> 19:53.318
I told you that in confidence, Gary.

19:57.322 --> 19:59.324
Ah, it's so great to have you back, Joe.

19:59.408 --> 20:01.034
You seem good as new.

20:01.118 --> 20:02.953
Yeah, it turns out
Dr. Hartman's cell phone

20:03.036 --> 20:04.872
was pressing on my spinal cord,

20:04.955 --> 20:07.457
and that's what was causing
my total paralysis.

20:07.541 --> 20:09.668
Yeah, sorry we dropped
the ball for a while,

20:09.751 --> 20:12.379
which is the way we agreed we'd
describe what we did to you,

20:12.462 --> 20:14.089
which hopefully
makes it seem less heinous.

20:14.173 --> 20:15.340
It's all right, guys.

20:15.424 --> 20:17.301
I'm just glad to be back on my feet.

20:17.384 --> 20:20.012
Well, you know what I mean.

20:22.639 --> 20:25.350
<i>I never saw much of Joe after that.</i>

20:25.434 --> 20:27.227
<i>And while he's been gone</i><i>for many years,</i>

20:27.311 --> 20:29.104
<i>I've never forgotten his face</i>

20:29.188 --> 20:31.523
<i>or his laughter.</i>

20:32.983 --> 20:34.902
Come on, are we going to the beach?

20:34.985 --> 20:36.445
We've been waiting forever.

20:36.528 --> 20:38.113
Yeah, be right there, champ.

20:38.197 --> 20:40.407
He said that the first two times we asked.

20:40.490 --> 20:45.162
I know, he spaces out
when he's at the computer.

20:53.170 --> 20:54.713
<i>These aren't my kids.</i>

20:54.796 --> 20:56.465
<i>And also, this isn't</i><i>play wrestling.</i>

20:56.548 --> 20:58.300
<i>We're actually fighting.</i>
