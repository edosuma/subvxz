00:17.388 --> 00:19.390
El Gato!

00:36.670 --> 00:39.325
<b>4x07 - Fancy Beast</b>

00:56.301 --> 00:58.053
Look at that sky, you two.

00:58.137 --> 01:01.432
Fantastically pink.
Like undercooked ham.

01:03.016 --> 01:04.518
Undercooked ham.

01:04.601 --> 01:06.937
You have such a way with words,
Señora Andante.

01:07.020 --> 01:09.022
These phrases you construct.

01:09.189 --> 01:10.399
He's right, Miguela.

01:10.524 --> 01:13.569
After you bested all those thieves
using nothing but your words,

01:13.652 --> 01:15.579
it'll be a cinch for us
to defeat this monster

01:15.580 --> 01:17.781
- who lives in your old house.
- Yes!

01:17.865 --> 01:18.991
You spout some rhymes,

01:19.074 --> 01:21.034
and we snatch the book
about the Crown of Souls,

01:21.118 --> 01:22.870
while the monster is dazed.

01:22.995 --> 01:24.163
We will be like...

01:25.205 --> 01:26.957
warrior librarians.

01:27.249 --> 01:28.458
Warbrarians!

01:29.459 --> 01:30.711
Hold your horses, kitties.

01:30.794 --> 01:34.423
It's gonna take more than rhymes
to defeat a horrible man-eating ogre.

01:34.506 --> 01:36.008
Let me tell you a story.

01:36.884 --> 01:41.513
Once upon a time, I sold my home
to a horrible, man-eating ogre.

01:45.684 --> 01:46.560
The end.

01:48.061 --> 01:50.898
That was... not much of a story.

01:50.981 --> 01:52.524
I'm not much of a writer.

01:52.774 --> 01:54.359
Do you remember any details?

01:54.443 --> 01:56.862
Anything that would help us to defeat him
and get the book?

01:56.945 --> 01:58.363
His name is Tranche.

01:58.447 --> 02:00.282
He's a disgusting ogre...

02:00.365 --> 02:02.451
...but he wants to be a fancy aristocrat.

02:02.534 --> 02:04.703
That's why he bought my house
in the first place.

02:06.872 --> 02:09.291
Hmm. So he likes fancy things.

02:09.958 --> 02:11.376
I like fancy things.

02:11.460 --> 02:13.587
I mean, look at my boots.

02:13.879 --> 02:15.589
Wait! I have an idea.

02:15.672 --> 02:18.258
We can defeat this ogre
because he likes fancy things.

02:18.342 --> 02:19.384
Come, my friends.

02:20.260 --> 02:21.637
Does he always do that?

02:21.720 --> 02:24.056
Proclaim he has an idea and then run away?

02:24.223 --> 02:26.099
All the time.

02:53.335 --> 02:56.588
Was this town always so... creepy?

02:56.672 --> 03:01.009
Having a man-eating ogre around
tends to drive down property values.

03:01.760 --> 03:05.639
But back when I lived here,
Dead Man's Hollow was the place to be.

03:07.266 --> 03:09.518
A real open-minded community.

03:14.815 --> 03:17.776
Ooh! Oh, there it is! My old house.

03:22.864 --> 03:24.866
So, everyone is clear on the plan?

03:24.950 --> 03:28.495
I will portray a very, really very
fancy prince traveling with his court.

03:28.578 --> 03:32.124
Miguela is our handmaiden,
and Dulcinea is a princess.

03:33.083 --> 03:35.377
Tranche will be so impressed
by our fanciness

03:35.460 --> 03:38.171
that he will have no choice
but to invite us in.

03:38.255 --> 03:41.008
This feels like lying.
Are you comfortable with it?

03:41.091 --> 03:43.927
Please, being a writer is all about lying.

03:44.011 --> 03:46.263
That and correcting people
when they use bad grammar.

03:47.723 --> 03:49.766
I know lying makes you uncomfortable,

03:49.850 --> 03:52.019
but if we are going to save San Lorenzo,

03:52.102 --> 03:55.230
we need the book that Miguela stole
the Crown of Souls information from.

03:55.314 --> 03:59.693
The book from which I stole
the Crown of Souls information.

04:00.319 --> 04:02.362
Writers.

04:02.696 --> 04:04.698
Writers.

04:06.908 --> 04:08.452
Let us hope this works.

04:11.663 --> 04:13.540
Uli, what are you doing here?

04:13.624 --> 04:15.500
I was worried about you.

04:15.584 --> 04:17.377
So I tracked you to this place
in order to...

04:17.461 --> 04:19.129
Uli, listen closely. I am...

04:23.675 --> 04:24.718
Halt, ogre!

04:24.801 --> 04:27.804
Do you not see that you are
in the presence of royalty?

04:30.515 --> 04:32.225
Um, I am?

04:34.853 --> 04:37.397
Oh. Right.

04:38.649 --> 04:41.109
Uh, there you go.

04:41.693 --> 04:43.070
Righty-o!

04:43.153 --> 04:46.323
And whomsoever may be upon my threshold,

04:46.406 --> 04:49.368
please to state your name
and business, what.

04:49.451 --> 04:51.912
Good ogre, I am pleased to announce

04:51.995 --> 04:54.081
that a prince has come to call.

04:54.164 --> 04:56.083
Ooh, so he has!

04:56.166 --> 04:59.628
I can tell it's him,
because of his fancy scepter.

04:59.711 --> 05:00.545
Hm?

05:01.046 --> 05:02.547
My Liege.

05:02.839 --> 05:04.841
I am Tranche.

05:04.925 --> 05:09.262
Uh, that is, Duke, no,
Count, no, Baron Tranche,

05:09.346 --> 05:11.181
and I cower at your

05:11.264 --> 05:13.892
well-manicured hooves.

05:14.476 --> 05:16.144
Oh. But I am no prince.

05:16.228 --> 05:21.316
Huh. The only thing nobler than a prince
is a humble prince.

05:22.651 --> 05:25.237
My dear ogre, he was not being humble.

05:25.320 --> 05:26.822
He is not a prince, he...

05:26.905 --> 05:27.739
Commoner!

05:29.199 --> 05:32.786
Are you saying I don't know
a prince when I see one?

05:32.869 --> 05:33.745
But I...

05:33.829 --> 05:36.748
Because I don't like being corrected.

05:37.082 --> 05:40.127
It makes me wanna eat somebody.

05:42.879 --> 05:45.465
Ja, it is I, Prince Uli.

05:45.549 --> 05:49.261
Und this here is mein princess,
mein courtier,

05:49.344 --> 05:52.889
und mein wretched manservant,
Kitty Dum-Dum.

05:53.390 --> 05:58.520
Polish mein hoovesies, Kitty,
lest they sully this lovely home.

06:02.649 --> 06:06.027
Polish mein hoovesies.

06:06.987 --> 06:07.821
Mm-mm.

06:09.322 --> 06:11.199
Mm-mm.

06:12.159 --> 06:13.034
Mm-hmm.

06:25.839 --> 06:28.258
I daresay, My Liege,

06:28.341 --> 06:33.013
that's the first time my house
has been called lovely by a prince.

06:33.096 --> 06:36.933
It's the first time my house has been
called anything by a prince.

06:37.017 --> 06:40.270
Come, let me show you around.

06:40.604 --> 06:42.189
He is buying it.

06:42.272 --> 06:46.067
Oh, it will be such fun tricking
the silly ogre, ja?

06:47.027 --> 06:50.071
How dare you look me
in mein eye, Kitty Dum-Dum.

06:50.155 --> 06:53.783
You only make the eye contact mit me
when I am telling you to.

06:54.701 --> 06:56.369
Come along, Kitty Dum-Dum.

06:57.787 --> 06:59.498
This, I do not like.

07:07.339 --> 07:11.134
Wow, this is some place you got here,
goodly ogre.

07:11.218 --> 07:14.012
Pip-pip!
It certainly is.

07:14.095 --> 07:18.892
This fancy room is where I keep
all my squiggle-papers.

07:18.975 --> 07:20.268
Squiggle-papers?

07:20.352 --> 07:23.396
Right. These things, see? Uh...

07:23.480 --> 07:28.360
They're full of papers what've got
all these little bitty squiggles on 'em.

07:28.443 --> 07:31.321
Rather comical, what?

07:31.404 --> 07:35.242
Mostly, I use 'em for bathroom paper.
Ahh!

07:38.578 --> 07:40.413
Oh, great and noble Tranche,

07:40.497 --> 07:42.833
would you mind if my courtier took, uh,

07:42.916 --> 07:45.752
admired your squiggle-papers?

07:45.836 --> 07:49.464
Milady, 'twould verily be an honor.

07:49.840 --> 07:50.966
Pip-pip!

07:56.388 --> 07:58.807
Hang on, then. Haven't we met?

07:59.599 --> 08:00.600
Certainly not.

08:03.895 --> 08:06.648
I beg your pardon, Milady.

08:06.815 --> 08:10.861
People who ain't ogres
all look the same to me.

08:10.944 --> 08:12.612
We find the book...

08:12.696 --> 08:13.613
We leave.

08:14.197 --> 08:18.159
So, here's a jolly handsome antique chair,
Your Highness,

08:18.326 --> 08:19.578
which I'll move...

08:19.661 --> 08:21.538
...so that you may step over here

08:21.621 --> 08:25.500
and observe my collection of rugs
what are from the Orient.

08:25.876 --> 08:30.338
Ah! I myself have spent much time
in the Orient slaying dragons. In fact...

08:30.422 --> 08:34.049
Hang on, then!
Your servant slayed dragons?

08:34.134 --> 08:37.679
That seems more like
a prince thing to do, what?

08:38.263 --> 08:39.514
Ja, of course.

08:39.597 --> 08:42.808
It was I, Prince Uli,
who did the slayings.

08:43.101 --> 08:46.980
All Kitty Dum-Dum did was to mop up
the squishy bits afterwards.

08:47.063 --> 08:48.315
Now, you hold on just a...

08:48.398 --> 08:49.900
Wretch!

08:50.901 --> 08:53.945
How dare you talk back to your master!

08:55.155 --> 08:59.492
Ja, wretch. Huh, he is right.
How dare you?

09:01.036 --> 09:04.581
I wouldn't take that kind of guff
from a servant, Your Highness.

09:04.789 --> 09:06.875
Back when I had servants,

09:07.125 --> 09:10.629
if one of them ever misbehaved,
I'd eat him.

09:10.795 --> 09:12.464
I'd eat him real good!

09:12.547 --> 09:14.841
Did you say you ate your servants?

09:14.925 --> 09:16.885
Uh, yes, Your Majesty.

09:16.968 --> 09:19.888
I tend to eat anyone who makes me upset.

09:23.099 --> 09:27.145
By Jove, I do think it's time
for dinner, what.

09:27.270 --> 09:28.980
Me hungry!

09:29.064 --> 09:30.774
Whoa!

09:30.899 --> 09:33.234
Me love dinner!

09:34.152 --> 09:35.695
It is going well, ja?

09:37.155 --> 09:40.200
Come, Kitty Dum-Dum,
follow me to the table.

09:40.283 --> 09:42.410
Your service is required.

09:43.745 --> 09:46.748
Dulcinea, I have never felt
so insulted in my life.

09:46.831 --> 09:49.876
I am a hero, not an insignificant servant.

09:49.960 --> 09:53.380
Let's just get that book so we can get out
of here and stop all this lying.

09:53.463 --> 09:56.299
Between you and me,
I'm not very good at it.

09:57.842 --> 10:00.553
Right. The book is what matters.

10:00.929 --> 10:03.056
Not whether I get to be the prince,
which I should be

10:03.139 --> 10:05.100
because I am the hero,
but that is okay.

10:05.183 --> 10:07.852
Why would I mind?

10:08.770 --> 10:09.604
The book.

10:11.314 --> 10:14.109
Welcome to my dining room.

10:14.693 --> 10:16.987
It looks a lot like the library.

10:17.070 --> 10:18.405
I know.

10:18.488 --> 10:21.241
Every room in this mansion is identical.

10:21.324 --> 10:24.911
Very fancy, aye, what? Very fancy.

10:24.995 --> 10:26.997
Pip-pip. Tally ho.

10:28.581 --> 10:29.624
Whoa!

10:34.671 --> 10:36.214
Me first!

10:48.685 --> 10:50.478
Uh, I mean...

10:50.979 --> 10:55.150
- Ladies first, of course.
- Ugh.

10:56.443 --> 10:59.529
Anyway, Herr Tranche,
the dinner looks very delicious.

10:59.612 --> 11:03.074
Oh, yes, my dear prince.
We are serving mince meat pie tonight.

11:03.158 --> 11:04.492
Any luck finding the book?

11:04.576 --> 11:06.786
Oh, yes! I found lots of books.

11:06.870 --> 11:09.205
- All my old favorites.
- Right.

11:09.289 --> 11:12.584
But any luck finding the book about,
you know, the Crown of Souls?

11:12.667 --> 11:15.170
The what? Oh, that. No, not at all.

11:15.253 --> 11:18.506
Oh, please hurry.
All this lying is killing me.

11:22.719 --> 11:25.472
Are you quite all right, Milady?

11:26.055 --> 11:27.056
Ooh. Oh!

11:27.140 --> 11:28.224
Oh, yes!

11:28.308 --> 11:31.603
Just a little congestion in... in my nose.

11:33.354 --> 11:35.106
So, Herr Tranche,

11:35.190 --> 11:38.985
how is it that a charming und handsome
aristocrat such as yourself

11:39.068 --> 11:40.278
does not have a wife?

11:40.987 --> 11:42.614
Oh! Uh...

11:42.697 --> 11:46.326
Is that something an aristocrat
is supposed to have?

11:46.409 --> 11:50.497
Uh, well, as it happens, I do have a wife.

11:50.580 --> 11:54.375
Uh, I'll just pop out
and tell her to come say hello.

11:56.044 --> 11:57.170
Ooh-hoo-hoo!

11:57.253 --> 11:59.881
The ruse is going so well, Herr Puss.

11:59.964 --> 12:03.843
The foolish ogre,
he is believing all of our fibbings.

12:03.927 --> 12:06.387
Uli, I warn you, if you do not...

12:06.471 --> 12:07.639
Hello.

12:07.722 --> 12:10.683
I am my wife now.

12:10.767 --> 12:13.937
Uh, it is nice to meet you all
for the first time.

12:19.192 --> 12:21.486
I have to leave now.

12:23.238 --> 12:25.156
That was my wife!

12:25.281 --> 12:27.367
Who said it wasn't? I'll eat you!

12:29.536 --> 12:30.411
Huh?

12:33.331 --> 12:36.334
Well, then, uh... anyone for pudding?

12:42.507 --> 12:43.341
Whoops!

12:43.591 --> 12:46.511
Nearly committed
a bit of a faux pas there.

12:46.594 --> 12:49.138
That would've been shoddy manners, what?

12:49.722 --> 12:51.266
Yes. It would have been.

12:52.433 --> 12:54.519
Uh... Mmm-mmm.

12:56.896 --> 12:57.772
Oh.

12:57.856 --> 12:59.732
Oh-ho-ho.

12:59.816 --> 13:02.610
Oh-ho.
How amusing, Herr Tranche.

13:02.944 --> 13:04.529
Uh, here, Kitty Dum-Dum.

13:04.612 --> 13:06.948
Now you will eat mein dirty napkin.

13:07.031 --> 13:09.284
It is covered in filth, just like you.

13:10.827 --> 13:11.661
Uh...

13:12.078 --> 13:14.205
Sometimes, Kitty Dum-Dum
needs to be insulted

13:14.289 --> 13:17.041
in order to fully understand his tasks.

13:17.125 --> 13:19.085
Eat the napkin, kitty.

13:20.128 --> 13:20.962
Eat it!

13:25.508 --> 13:26.384
Uh...

13:31.723 --> 13:34.601
No one makes Puss in Boots

13:34.684 --> 13:36.269
eat a filthy napkin!

13:36.352 --> 13:37.187
Huh?

13:37.270 --> 13:38.146
Ogre...

13:38.938 --> 13:41.399
we have been perpetuating a ruse.

13:41.482 --> 13:45.904
I'm not a servant and he is not a prince!

13:48.990 --> 13:50.116
What...

13:50.783 --> 13:54.204
did you say?!

13:58.249 --> 13:59.083
Hmm?

13:59.792 --> 14:02.921
Good show. Good show, you two.

14:03.004 --> 14:06.883
You were doing a spot
of light theater, eh?

14:07.175 --> 14:09.886
You really had me believing
that you were a servant

14:09.969 --> 14:11.179
and you were a prince,

14:11.262 --> 14:15.850
when all the while, you were the servant
and you were the prince.

14:17.143 --> 14:19.437
And you knew about this, Princess?

14:19.520 --> 14:22.690
You've been lying this whole time.

14:23.358 --> 14:27.028
Uh... Uh-huh.
But that's what princesses do.

14:27.612 --> 14:30.782
Bravo with the playacting, everyone.

14:30.865 --> 14:36.037
But, now then, let's have you two
stick to your proper roles, yes?

14:36.329 --> 14:39.457
When I find things too confusing...

14:40.166 --> 14:44.462
it makes me wanna eat
whoever's closest to me.

14:48.091 --> 14:50.802
Right. Who's for an evening stroll?

14:50.927 --> 14:51.803
Jolly good.

14:57.809 --> 15:01.271
As you can see,
I have many fine things.

15:01.354 --> 15:03.439
Over there's a chandelier.

15:03.523 --> 15:06.276
And then there's more squiggle-papers.

15:06.651 --> 15:07.944
Herr Puss,

15:08.027 --> 15:10.029
I have come to the conclusion

15:10.113 --> 15:13.533
that you are using your role as prince
to manipulate me.

15:13.616 --> 15:16.536
Just as you did to me
when you were the prince, Uli.

15:16.619 --> 15:20.707
I will show you what happens
when you cross Uli, mein friend.

15:21.833 --> 15:24.752
Then we will see who is Kitty Dum-Dum.

15:24.961 --> 15:27.797
Obviously, it would be me.
I am the kitty!

15:32.802 --> 15:34.637
Dulcinea, you're just in time.

15:34.721 --> 15:39.559
Lady Horseneck has begun to suspect
that her husband is not who he says he is.

15:39.726 --> 15:42.353
Oh, haven't you found
the Crown of Souls book yet?

15:42.437 --> 15:45.565
Honestly, I haven't been looking.
It's just so hard.

15:45.648 --> 15:47.025
All my favorites are here,

15:47.108 --> 15:49.986
and I just wanna binge-read
each and every...

15:50.570 --> 15:51.612
What's the matter with you?

15:51.696 --> 15:54.741
I can feel the lies crawling all over me.

15:54.824 --> 15:57.493
If we don't get out of here soon,
I'm gonna scream.

15:57.577 --> 15:59.329
Well, well, well...

16:02.040 --> 16:05.752
What's going on here?

16:06.377 --> 16:11.924
You know, I'm starting to think that
something here isn't what it seems.

16:12.508 --> 16:14.344
I might have to eat somebody.

16:14.427 --> 16:16.471
Or two somebodies!

16:17.096 --> 16:19.724
Mr. Tranche, I have to tell you
the truth about...

16:19.807 --> 16:21.893
Ha-ha!

16:21.976 --> 16:25.730
It's time for Her Majesty's
daily face massage,

16:25.813 --> 16:28.358
to keep her looking young
and wrinkle-free.

16:28.441 --> 16:29.442
Uh...

16:29.525 --> 16:30.360
What?

16:30.443 --> 16:33.571
It works. Here, judge for yourself.

16:36.532 --> 16:40.745
Book or no book, I'm not getting eaten
by an ogre today, thank you very much.

16:42.330 --> 16:44.665
I say, Butterthwaite,

16:44.749 --> 16:50.171
is it me or are those two
acting suspiciously?

16:52.048 --> 16:53.257
Pip-pip.

16:56.803 --> 16:58.679
- That was cruel.
- You started this.

16:58.763 --> 17:00.515
- I have sensitive teeth.
- It is not my fault.

17:06.854 --> 17:09.941
Are you feeling like some
evening entertainment, Señor Tranche?

17:10.023 --> 17:12.609
I could instruct my servant, Uli,
to choke himself for us.

17:12.693 --> 17:16.656
Actually, Your Highness,
I am having a better idea.

17:22.994 --> 17:26.540
You see, it is I who is the true prince,

17:26.624 --> 17:31.462
for who but a blue-blooded nobleman
could possibly yodel so well?

17:31.546 --> 17:33.339
Oh, right.

17:33.631 --> 17:35.007
Hadn't thought of it that way.

17:35.091 --> 17:36.884
So, you're the prince, then.

17:36.968 --> 17:40.346
What?
 No! I can yodel as well.

17:45.935 --> 17:47.770
Okay, so I cannot yodel.

17:47.854 --> 17:50.189
Of course you cannot, Kitty Dum-Dum.

17:50.273 --> 17:52.024
You are good at nothing.

17:53.192 --> 17:57.530
Except, of course,
your famous bootsy puppets show.

17:57.613 --> 18:01.075
I do not use my boots for anything
except looking incredibly dapper.

18:01.159 --> 18:02.785
I am the one who is the true prince,

18:02.869 --> 18:04.454
not this traitorous swine.

18:04.537 --> 18:07.540
I shall prove it with the classic test
of nobility.

18:07.623 --> 18:09.459
Standing on one's head.

18:12.795 --> 18:13.713
Oh, right.

18:13.796 --> 18:16.007
Well, that's convincing enough for me.

18:16.090 --> 18:17.884
Ha. Try to out-noble that.

18:17.967 --> 18:19.302
I shall.

18:19.385 --> 18:22.513
Mit some practiced Baroque waltzing.

18:22.763 --> 18:25.892
Und eins, zwei, drei,
eins, zwei, drei.

18:25.975 --> 18:29.770
Who but a true sovereign could waltz
und count at the same time?

18:29.854 --> 18:32.732
- Eins, zwei, drei...
- You make a good point, but...

18:32.815 --> 18:35.109
If it is a true test of nobility you want,

18:35.193 --> 18:37.820
then observe as I hold my breath

18:37.904 --> 18:39.447
- for 30 seconds!
- Eins, zwei, drei.

18:41.282 --> 18:44.285
- Uh...
- Eins, zwei, drei.

18:51.250 --> 18:52.668
- Eins, zwei, drei.

18:52.752 --> 18:54.504
Enough!

18:54.795 --> 18:59.342
I daresay,
I don't think either of you is a prince!

19:02.553 --> 19:05.515
No, no, no, no, no.
One of us is definitely a prince.

19:05.598 --> 19:07.934
Ja. Whichever one you prefer.

19:08.017 --> 19:10.978
I'm very confused now. Very confused!

19:11.062 --> 19:14.982
And when I get confused...

19:15.066 --> 19:18.069
I eat someone!

19:23.866 --> 19:27.119
Herr Boots, you have done
the savings of me.

19:27.203 --> 19:30.665
Of course. A vindictive friend
is still a friend.

19:30.748 --> 19:34.961
So, it's a fight you want,
eh, Kitty Dum-Dum?

19:59.402 --> 20:01.237
The jig is up, friends!

20:01.320 --> 20:04.740
Our lie... is exposed!

20:06.617 --> 20:08.244
Oh, thank goodness!

20:10.496 --> 20:12.081
I will hold him off.

20:12.164 --> 20:15.334
You, find the book at once.

20:27.179 --> 20:30.600
You are a most fearsome
adversary, Tranche.

20:30.683 --> 20:33.728
I hope you'll be the last ogre
I ever meet.

20:40.735 --> 20:42.528
I have done the findings of it.

20:42.612 --> 20:44.363
Is this the one?

20:44.447 --> 20:45.573
It sure is.

20:46.782 --> 20:48.576
"Yea, that which is yclept..."

20:48.659 --> 20:50.453
- Huh?
- "...ye Crown of Souls

20:50.536 --> 20:54.290
verily be linked through bonds
most eldritch to ye totem

20:54.373 --> 20:56.542
- most mighty, known only to those..."
- How...

20:56.626 --> 20:58.002
How are you doing that?

20:58.586 --> 21:02.715
You're looking at those squiggles
and saying things from your mouth.

21:03.299 --> 21:04.800
It's called reading.

21:04.967 --> 21:06.761
Do you not know what reading is?

21:07.386 --> 21:08.596
I've heard of it.

21:08.679 --> 21:12.350
Look, these books
are full of stories, knowledge,

21:12.433 --> 21:15.102
tawdry romances and even etiquette.

21:15.686 --> 21:16.562
Etiquette?

21:16.812 --> 21:22.193
Can these "books" teach me
how to be a fancy aristocrat?

21:22.276 --> 21:23.611
I think this one could.

21:23.778 --> 21:27.239
How to Be a Fancy Aristocrat,
by A. F. Aristocrat.

21:29.492 --> 21:34.413
Could you teach me
how to make words out of squiggles?

21:34.997 --> 21:35.873
How to read?

21:35.956 --> 21:37.208
Yeah, that.

21:37.875 --> 21:41.003
I could, if you don't eat my friends,

21:41.170 --> 21:43.172
and you let them take one book with them.

21:43.255 --> 21:44.632
Agreed!

21:44.882 --> 21:47.176
Agreed, by Jove!

21:47.343 --> 21:48.761
Yay!

21:48.886 --> 21:50.763
Let's read this one!

21:53.057 --> 21:56.018
First rule of reading:
don't tear up the book.

21:56.102 --> 21:59.230
Oh. Don't tear up the book.

21:59.689 --> 22:04.151
I say, this "reading"
is rather tricky business, what.

22:04.568 --> 22:09.323
Oh! I positively cannot wait
to spend time with all my old books.

22:09.490 --> 22:11.242
All but one.

22:14.203 --> 22:17.998
Farewell.
 Safe travels and whatnot.

22:18.082 --> 22:21.377
Bye, Miguela.
Promise me you'll write me every day.

22:21.460 --> 22:23.087
Not a chance!

22:23.796 --> 22:26.048
What nice people.

22:26.215 --> 22:29.635
Yeah, shame you didn't get
to spend more time with them.

22:29.802 --> 22:31.712
- Pip-pip!
- Pip-pip!
