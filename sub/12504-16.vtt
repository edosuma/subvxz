00:06.274 --> 00:08.576
[Payson] Previously on
Make It Or Break It:

00:08.609 --> 00:11.812
I've seen you do this before.
You get all serious
about a girl,

00:11.845 --> 00:15.583
- then blow it up.
- Maybe I should have known
that you were one of those guys

00:15.616 --> 00:19.453
who won't call for days
and then will call from jail
when they need bail money.

00:19.487 --> 00:22.356
- Emily, listen.
- We have nothing to talk about.

00:22.390 --> 00:25.259
- I'm sorry I'm still here.
- I told you,
stay as long as you want.

00:25.293 --> 00:28.096
- I wonder what she
would think of us dating.
- Are we?

00:28.129 --> 00:31.465
If you actually admit you care,
you might be disappointed.

00:31.499 --> 00:34.602
- What happened
to the invisible girl?
- She's coming back to life.

00:34.635 --> 00:36.504
[Sasha] I got
off the phone with
an orthopedic surgeon

00:36.537 --> 00:39.507
and she's developed
a new procedure
that fix Payson's back.

00:46.514 --> 00:49.117
- You are such an idiot!
- [phone ringing]

00:49.150 --> 00:50.618
What are you smiling about?

00:50.651 --> 00:55.823
- [phone ringing]
- Hello? Damon?

00:55.856 --> 00:59.227
- I'm not here.
- I'm sorry.
You just missed her.

00:59.260 --> 01:02.496
Again. Yeah, of course.
I'll let her know. Bye.

01:02.530 --> 01:05.533
I know what you're thinking.
Damon's a good guy.

01:05.566 --> 01:08.636
I should talk to him.
Let him explain about jail.

01:08.669 --> 01:10.638
- Give him a second chance.
- Au contraire.

01:10.671 --> 01:15.143
I was thinking
that the Kmetko women
have a long, tragic history

01:15.176 --> 01:17.211
of trying to
rehabilitate unworthy men.

01:17.245 --> 01:19.613
Now, by Kmetko women
you mean...

01:19.647 --> 01:24.452
Me. But I was thinking we
need to change the pattern.

01:24.485 --> 01:27.655
Both of us. If your gut
is telling you that
Damon is bad news,

01:27.688 --> 01:30.124
then that's
all you need to know.

01:35.563 --> 01:37.531
Carter?

01:37.565 --> 01:40.168
Carter!

01:40.201 --> 01:43.571
- Carter!
- Lauren?

01:43.604 --> 01:45.539
Let me guess.
Gay pride celebration?

01:45.573 --> 01:48.142
- What?
- You. Coming out of the closet.

01:48.176 --> 01:50.411
Funny. No. I was hiding.

01:50.444 --> 01:52.613
Thought you might be your dad
with another one of his dates.

01:52.646 --> 01:55.283
- What are you talking about?
- Your dad.

01:55.316 --> 01:56.684
He brought a woman
up here last night.

01:56.717 --> 01:59.320
The reason he didn't find me
is I hid in the closet

01:59.353 --> 02:01.555
- at the last second.
- Crazy. My dad would never...

02:01.589 --> 02:04.592
[Carter laughs] Oh.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.427
Your dad, his date.

02:06.460 --> 02:09.597
Pink lipstick?
Did they have sex?

02:09.630 --> 02:11.932
I don't think so.
Unless it was...

02:11.965 --> 02:13.634
...funny sex.
They laughed a lot.

02:13.667 --> 02:16.170
- What did her laugh sound like?
- [shrill laughter]

02:16.204 --> 02:18.706
OK, you're useless.
I need to CSI this.

02:18.739 --> 02:21.309
[sniffing]
Cheap perfume.

02:21.342 --> 02:23.344
- How can you tell?
- It lingers.

02:23.377 --> 02:25.913
My dad would only bring
someone up here if he didn't
want to be seen with her.

02:25.946 --> 02:29.550
Which means she's either
a tramp, or a married tramp.

02:29.583 --> 02:33.321
- With split ends.
- I have to find
someplace else to stay.

02:33.354 --> 02:36.957
If I'm gonna show Kaylie
I'm a winner, I have to focus.

02:36.990 --> 02:39.660
No, no, you don't have to!
You can stay.

02:39.693 --> 02:42.563
You know, just put
your things away.

02:42.596 --> 02:45.199
I... I will make sure my dad
never sets foot up here again.

02:45.233 --> 02:47.735
I'm gonna figure this out.

02:47.768 --> 02:49.370
Eventually, you're
gonna go to Beijing

02:49.403 --> 02:51.239
and compete against the best
women's gymnastic team

02:51.272 --> 02:53.607
- in the world.
Is that too tight?
- No. It's good.

02:53.641 --> 02:56.477
To beat the Chinese,
you need to up
your degree of difficulty

02:56.510 --> 02:57.611
on every apparatus,

02:57.645 --> 03:00.348
starting with the double
Arabian. Whenever you're ready.

03:02.583 --> 03:04.785
[rock music plays]

03:16.530 --> 03:19.500
More height.
Let's go again.

03:24.272 --> 03:25.539
Ah!

03:25.573 --> 03:27.575
You have to commit
to this move

03:27.608 --> 03:29.643
with every fiber
of your being.

03:29.677 --> 03:31.245
Again.

03:35.816 --> 03:37.418
- [grunts]
- No!

03:37.451 --> 03:40.621
- No, no!
- I'm trying.

03:40.654 --> 03:42.656
Stop trying and just do it!

03:42.690 --> 03:44.792
All eyes are gonna
be on you in China.

03:44.825 --> 03:46.694
The one question on their
mind will be is Kaylie Cruz

03:46.727 --> 03:50.264
a one-hit-wonder or a serious
contender for gold in 2012?

03:50.298 --> 03:52.433
The answer is up to you!

03:59.607 --> 04:02.310
Don't let him psych you out.
You'll get it.

04:02.343 --> 04:03.511
I'm just not strong enough.

04:03.544 --> 04:07.315
Nicky was helping me, but
now he's gone to Denver, so...

04:07.348 --> 04:11.385
I'll help you. I'm starting
to come early every day now.

04:12.586 --> 04:15.356
Come on, Mom. Work it.
Give me a little sexy mama.

04:15.389 --> 04:17.425
I'm a mess. I'm trying
to get your lunch packed.

04:17.458 --> 04:20.661
Forget the domestic diva. I'll
give you a little sexy mama.

04:20.694 --> 04:22.363
- OK.
- Ready?

04:22.396 --> 04:23.364
- Yep.
- Ooh!

04:23.397 --> 04:24.565
Wow, beautiful.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.567
You're sexy, you're strong.

04:26.600 --> 04:29.570
You're intense. You're...
sort of scaring me now.

04:29.603 --> 04:31.705
- Wow.
- Wait a minute. I'm
gonna show you how it's done.

04:31.739 --> 04:34.508
Here we go. Ooh!

04:34.542 --> 04:38.446
- I am Inga. Inga is so sexy.
- [laughing]

04:38.479 --> 04:40.548
Inga is so slinky.

04:40.581 --> 04:44.685
Oh, do not hate Inga
because I am so fabulous.

04:44.718 --> 04:46.687
- Mmm!
- [door opens]

04:46.720 --> 04:50.458
- Good morning, Heather.
- Good morning, Mrs. Keeler.

04:50.491 --> 04:52.760
[laughing] Mr. Keeler.
I let myself in.

04:52.793 --> 04:55.596
- [laughter]
- Prom emergency!

04:55.629 --> 04:58.499
My entire decoration
staff just quit.

04:58.532 --> 05:00.067
They said I was
too dictatorial.

05:00.100 --> 05:02.703
- Heather is chairman
of the prom committee.
- Oh!

05:02.736 --> 05:04.605
I'm ruined.
Prom is tomorrow night

05:04.638 --> 05:08.842
and we need to make 200
tissue-paper passion pandorea.

05:08.876 --> 05:12.713
She's also president
of the botany club. [laughs]

05:12.746 --> 05:14.582
- [Heather] What am I gonna do?
- Relax.

05:14.615 --> 05:17.485
I know some girls who can help.
All right.

05:17.518 --> 05:22.490
- I'm off.
- [smacks kiss]

05:22.523 --> 05:24.458
- See you guys after school.
- Bye.

05:24.492 --> 05:25.693
- [Mark] Bye.
- One more.

05:25.726 --> 05:27.361
- Oh, sure.
- [camera clicks]

05:27.395 --> 05:30.864
You guys are so funny.
[laughs]

05:30.898 --> 05:32.933
- Bye.
- [Kim] Bye.

05:35.569 --> 05:38.906
- I never thought she'd be
happy without gymnastics.
- Me either.

05:38.939 --> 05:41.375
Which is why I don't
want to get her hopes up

05:41.409 --> 05:42.342
with some doctor

05:42.376 --> 05:44.512
from Europe with an
experimental procedure.

05:44.545 --> 05:46.847
So she can her tell us what six
of the other greatest doctors

05:46.880 --> 05:49.750
in our country
have already told us.
We agreed, no more doctors.

05:49.783 --> 05:53.621
No, we just shouldn't
put Payson through that
kind of disappointment again.

05:53.654 --> 05:56.424
Which is why I think
it's best we don't tell her.

05:56.457 --> 05:59.393
- Can we do that?
- We're her parents.

05:59.427 --> 06:02.730
It's our job to protect her,
and, in this case,

06:02.763 --> 06:05.666
what she doesn't know
can't hurt her.

06:25.719 --> 06:29.457
- [pop music plays]
- Go!

06:30.223 --> 06:32.426
Knees high.
Knees high!

06:32.460 --> 06:33.694
Dig, dig. Use your arms.

06:33.727 --> 06:35.729
Use your arms!

06:35.763 --> 06:38.899
Drive, Kaylie, drive!
Drive, drive, drive!

06:38.932 --> 06:42.970
- [panting]
- Good. One more time.

06:43.003 --> 06:46.206
- Let's go.
- I don't see how this is gonna
help me with my double Arabian.

06:46.239 --> 06:49.777
Speed... converted into power.
Power gives you height.

06:49.810 --> 06:52.746
And height is what you need
to pull a double Arabian.

06:52.780 --> 06:55.683
- Ready?
- No.

06:55.716 --> 06:57.651
I need some water.

06:57.685 --> 07:00.988
* Keep on for ages

07:01.021 --> 07:04.892
I guess leaving those rose
petals on Kaylie's car wasn't
such a stupid idea after all?

07:04.925 --> 07:09.563
She hasn't mentioned them.
And I'm just helping her train.

07:09.597 --> 07:11.732
Ever wonder if it's worth it,
opening yourself up

07:11.765 --> 07:13.734
to someone and trying
to make it work

07:13.767 --> 07:15.736
when maybe it's
just not meant to be?

07:15.769 --> 07:19.239
Every day. But I always
end up back in the same place.

07:19.272 --> 07:23.744
She's the one.
She's it. My soul mate.

07:23.777 --> 07:28.248
Must be nice to be so sure.
You know what? You're right.

07:28.281 --> 07:29.950
Guys do have
each other's back.

07:29.983 --> 07:33.621
* If you really wanna win big

07:33.654 --> 07:37.491
* Then put your money
where your mouth is *

07:37.525 --> 07:39.627
What's going on
with you and Carter?

07:39.660 --> 07:43.897
Nothing. He's just helping me
with my double Arabian.

07:43.931 --> 07:46.934
So, what? Now that Nicky's gone,
you're going back for seconds?

07:46.967 --> 07:50.671
- Why would you care if I did?
- I care about you.

07:50.704 --> 07:52.239
Once a cheater,
always a cheater.

07:52.272 --> 07:54.775
Right.
I'll keep that in mind.

07:54.808 --> 07:58.679
* A good look around
There's so much to see **

08:01.649 --> 08:03.651
- [laughs]
- I think you should know,

08:03.684 --> 08:05.919
someone's been fooling
around in our garage attic.

08:05.953 --> 08:10.257
Hold on. Uh, what makes
you say that, sweetie?

08:10.290 --> 08:13.727
I found an empty wine box
and two wine glasses.

08:13.761 --> 08:16.664
And the whole place reeks
of cheap perfume like

08:16.697 --> 08:19.867
- a sleazy strip club.
- My perfume is not cheap.

08:19.900 --> 08:24.705
OK, first, strip clubs do
not reek of cheap perfume.

08:24.738 --> 08:26.774
Not all of them,
so I'm told.

08:26.807 --> 08:28.275
[stammering]
And second...

08:28.308 --> 08:30.644
OK, tell her it was the
housekeeper and the gardener.

08:30.678 --> 08:35.015
And second, it was probably
Consuela and a gentleman friend.

08:35.048 --> 08:38.552
- Consuela is like 100.
- Consuela's had a hard life.

08:38.586 --> 08:40.654
She's not as old
as you might think.

08:40.688 --> 08:44.091
- Wait, what were
you doing up there?
- Oh, it's my quiet place.

08:44.124 --> 08:48.696
Summer told me I should have
that's my own little sanctuary,

08:48.729 --> 08:52.566
you know, a place
to pray and meditate and...

08:52.600 --> 08:55.636
So I go up there.
All hours. Day and night.

08:55.669 --> 08:58.839
Oh, my gosh, how awful
would it be if I were
to surprise Consuela

08:58.872 --> 09:02.643
when she's having
this booty call?

09:02.676 --> 09:04.912
That won't happen.
I'll speak to her.

09:06.780 --> 09:07.981
Later.

09:08.015 --> 09:11.151
OK, let's see
your flowers, girls.

09:12.786 --> 09:14.722
This is fun.

09:14.755 --> 09:17.591
What kind of flowers
are these supposed to be?

09:17.625 --> 09:19.660
From the looks of yours,
um, dead ones.

09:19.693 --> 09:21.995
Look who's talking. Yours
looks like an irritable bowel.

09:22.029 --> 09:24.698
Don't worry about it,
mine looks like...

09:24.732 --> 09:27.334
- A hemorrhoid.
- Yep.

09:27.367 --> 09:31.004
I'm sorry, Heather.
We're not super crafty.

09:31.038 --> 09:32.806
- This is new for us.
- That's OK.

09:32.840 --> 09:35.976
I mean, I can't
do a cartwheel, so...

09:36.009 --> 09:38.746
We'll just put these
in the "maybe" pile,

09:38.779 --> 09:41.014
you know, until you
get the hang of it.

09:41.048 --> 09:43.717
So is there gonna
be a prom king and queen?

09:43.751 --> 09:46.720
- And a dance contest?
- And a band?

09:46.754 --> 09:48.856
You've never been
to a prom before, have you?

09:48.889 --> 09:52.626
- Well, no.
- But we've seen them in movies.

09:52.660 --> 09:55.095
- We're homeschooled.
- And we're not allowed to date.

09:55.128 --> 09:56.930
- Which never stopped you.
- Or you.

09:56.964 --> 09:58.766
- I wasn't dating.
- Right, hooking up.

09:58.799 --> 10:00.768
[Heather clears throat]
So anyway,

10:00.801 --> 10:03.737
the theme
is "Tropical Paradise."

10:03.771 --> 10:06.640
It's a formal event.
Long dresses, or short,

10:06.674 --> 10:08.742
if they're expensive.

10:08.776 --> 10:12.045
- Or super slutty.
- So, Pay, what are you wearing?

10:12.079 --> 10:14.381
- Pretty in Pink I hope!
- I'm not going.

10:14.414 --> 10:16.016
- You're not?
- [both] You have to go!

10:16.049 --> 10:17.918
[Heather] Is this
about the back brace?

10:17.951 --> 10:21.722
Because I went to the
freshman prom and hardly
anybody made fun of me.

10:21.755 --> 10:24.825
I don't want to go. Besides, I
don't have anybody to go with.

10:24.858 --> 10:27.728
- What about that guy, Ike?
- [Heather] Ike?

10:27.761 --> 10:31.932
At a prom? Maybe if the
theme was Apocalypse Now.

10:31.965 --> 10:36.770
[Heather laughs]
I have an idea!
What if we all go?

10:36.804 --> 10:38.038
Don't we have
to go to your school?

10:38.071 --> 10:40.073
No, I'm chairman
of the prom committee.

10:40.107 --> 10:42.743
- What I say goes.
- Oh, my God!

10:42.776 --> 10:44.912
- We are going to the prom!
- [screaming]

10:44.945 --> 10:47.948
- Wait. Only if Payson goes.
- Why?

10:48.749 --> 10:50.751
Oh, right.

10:50.784 --> 10:53.754
If you don't go to prom,
I will never talk to you again.

10:56.223 --> 10:57.691
Fine. We'll go to prom.

10:57.725 --> 10:59.960
- We're going to prom!
- [screaming]

10:59.993 --> 11:03.230
[girls singing]
* We're going to prom

11:03.263 --> 11:06.734
You had better sit down.
You're not gonna believe this.

11:06.767 --> 11:11.872
Payson, our daughter,
is going to the prom.

11:13.774 --> 11:15.709
- What?
- [sighs]

11:15.743 --> 11:18.078
- I just got off the phone
with Dr. Clijster.
- Who?

11:18.111 --> 11:19.813
The doctor from Europe.

11:19.847 --> 11:22.716
She's in Boulder
for a medical conference,

11:22.750 --> 11:25.218
and she's convinced
she can help Payson.

11:25.252 --> 11:27.821
[whispers] There's nothing
wrong with Payson.

11:27.855 --> 11:31.091
- [whispers] I agree.
- But?

11:32.192 --> 11:34.728
I think we...

11:34.762 --> 11:37.765
...at least owe it
to Payson to hear her out.

11:41.769 --> 11:43.503
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:43.536 --> 11:46.840
So on a scale from one to ten,
how mad at me are you?

11:46.874 --> 11:48.976
Ten being highest,
I'd say 11.

11:49.009 --> 11:51.812
Look, I wanted to tell you,
it's just...

11:51.845 --> 11:53.280
Bros before hoes.
Yeah, I get it.

11:53.313 --> 11:55.783
All right, first of all,
you are not a ho.

11:55.816 --> 11:59.252
And frankly, I do not appreciate
the anti-feminist expression.

12:00.854 --> 12:03.290
OK, uh, seriously.

12:03.323 --> 12:05.158
The reason I bailed
the dude out of jail

12:05.192 --> 12:09.262
was not because of him, Emily.
It was because of you.

12:09.296 --> 12:12.833
You were freaking out
that he hadn't called you
and, I don't know,

12:12.866 --> 12:16.003
just too embarrassed
to call you from jail.

12:16.036 --> 12:19.272
I just can't believe
I'm so stupid.
I let myself...

12:19.306 --> 12:22.309
- What?
- We're not even
supposed to have boyfriends.

12:22.342 --> 12:23.443
And this is why.

12:23.476 --> 12:26.046
I've watched my mother
chase after men her whole life,

12:26.079 --> 12:28.248
and where did it get her?
Nowhere.

12:28.281 --> 12:30.818
I won't make that mistake.

12:30.851 --> 12:35.255
- So you haven't
seen Damon since jail?
- No.

12:35.288 --> 12:38.358
- And I don't want to.
- Then you might not
want to turn around.

12:42.095 --> 12:44.798
Emily, you need to hear me out.

12:44.832 --> 12:46.266
You owe me that much.

12:55.876 --> 12:58.211
I need you to believe me, Emily.
I didn't do anything wrong.

12:58.245 --> 13:01.214
The reason you didn't
call me from jail is
because you're innocent?

13:01.248 --> 13:03.116
I was stupid.
I was in the wrong place

13:03.150 --> 13:04.952
at the wrong time
and I was embarrassed.

13:04.985 --> 13:06.086
But I'm not a criminal.

13:06.119 --> 13:07.187
Says the guy
who picked a lock

13:07.220 --> 13:10.090
- to get me into
the gym at night.
- You know me.

13:10.123 --> 13:13.560
Do I? Because
the guy I thought I knew

13:13.593 --> 13:15.896
promised he'd always
be honest with me.

13:15.929 --> 13:18.165
And then,
he just disappeared.

13:18.198 --> 13:20.133
Like my father
and my step-father

13:20.167 --> 13:22.235
and every other loser
my mother ever dated.

13:22.269 --> 13:25.605
- And I just can't handle that.
- I'm not a loser.

13:25.638 --> 13:29.843
- That's what I was
trying to prove to you.
- Gymnastics is my only way out.

13:29.877 --> 13:33.146
It's the only thing
that is gonna save me
from ending up like my mother.

13:35.415 --> 13:37.885
The National Team
is going to China,

13:37.918 --> 13:41.321
and I just have to stay focused
if I want to make the final cut.

13:41.354 --> 13:44.091
I can't be all messed up.
I'm sorry.

13:47.995 --> 13:51.131
No. Seriously? Dude, you
should just give her some space.

13:51.164 --> 13:53.366
You'd like that, wouldn't you?
Then you can cut in.

13:53.400 --> 13:58.438
Gee, and I was so nice to you
when you cut in on me. [scoffs]

14:01.208 --> 14:04.611
- You work here now?
- Nah, I just like the shirt.

14:04.644 --> 14:07.114
- Don't tell me
you work here, too?
- Please.

14:07.147 --> 14:10.183
I would never work here.
I wouldn't even eat here.

14:10.217 --> 14:14.054
Wow, drama-rama.
What's up with you and Damon?

14:14.087 --> 14:16.924
- Nothing anymore.
- Oh. So I've got good news.

14:16.957 --> 14:19.026
Guess what?
We're going to prom!

14:19.059 --> 14:21.161
What are you talking about?

14:21.194 --> 14:24.197
You know, corsages, pretty
dresses, dinner and dancing.

14:24.231 --> 14:26.099
Like a real-life
John Hughes movie.

14:26.133 --> 14:30.103
I'm really not in
the mood for a prom.

14:30.137 --> 14:32.906
This isn't about you.
This is about supporting Payson.

14:32.940 --> 14:35.108
And she'll only go to
her prom if we go, too.

14:35.142 --> 14:37.978
When are we ever
gonna get a chance to go
to prom like normal girls?

14:38.011 --> 14:40.147
- I was hoping never.
- Come on.

14:40.180 --> 14:44.051
Prom's a rite of passage.
You really can't miss out on it.

14:44.084 --> 14:47.187
- Did you go to your prom?
- Well, no.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.122
Well, you're in luck then.
We need dates.

14:49.156 --> 14:52.259
- What are you doing tomorrow?
- [sighs]

14:52.292 --> 14:55.295
Looks like I got
a date to the prom.

14:55.328 --> 14:57.130
Payse!

14:59.967 --> 15:01.969
Uh-uh. Forget it.

15:02.002 --> 15:03.336
No way I'm gonna
be your date.

15:03.370 --> 15:07.307
Relax, working man.
We're going as a group.

15:07.340 --> 15:10.477
But hey, I'm sure there'll be
tons of hot high school boys

15:10.510 --> 15:13.680
that would love to dance
with Kaylie all night.

15:13.713 --> 15:17.184
- OK, I'll go. As a group.
- Great.

15:17.217 --> 15:19.352
We need two more boys.
So ask a couple of your friends.

15:19.386 --> 15:22.255
Cute, tall friends.
No dorks, please.

15:23.490 --> 15:26.159
This is so exciting!
I have to get a new dress.

15:43.243 --> 15:46.146
- [rock music plays]
- More speed! More speed!

15:46.179 --> 15:49.149
- More speed! More speed!
- [grunts]

15:49.182 --> 15:52.119
You have to explode
off the floor.

15:52.152 --> 15:55.288
I'm not a stick of dynamite.

16:01.061 --> 16:03.296
[panting]

16:04.297 --> 16:07.534
One more time.

16:07.567 --> 16:09.169
Without the harness.

16:09.202 --> 16:12.205
No. I obviously
can't do it myself.

16:12.239 --> 16:15.175
Yes, you can. But you're using
the harness as a safety net.

16:15.208 --> 16:19.312
As long as you know
it's there to catch you,
you don't have to commit.

16:19.346 --> 16:21.281
Trust me.
You don't need a safety net.

16:21.314 --> 16:23.183
It's just getting in your way.

17:02.322 --> 17:04.591
I did it.

17:04.624 --> 17:08.061
- You were right.
- See?

17:08.095 --> 17:10.397
You trusted me,
you didn't get hurt.

17:15.635 --> 17:18.805
I'm sorry. But at the risk
of being a horrible father,

17:18.838 --> 17:22.375
I'm not giving you $600
to buy yet another dress.

17:22.409 --> 17:26.313
But it's not just any dress.
It's a prom dress.

17:26.346 --> 17:30.350
- And I need to look amazing.
- Why? Who are you
even going with?

17:30.383 --> 17:33.553
Carter Anderson. And a bunch
of other guys and girls.
It's a group thing.

17:33.586 --> 17:36.189
- I see.
- Five hundred?

17:36.223 --> 17:40.127
No hundred. You've got
two closets filled
with designer frocks.

17:40.160 --> 17:43.196
And, last I looked, most of them
still had the tags on them.

17:43.230 --> 17:45.165
[sighs]

17:47.467 --> 17:51.171
Seriously, Mom, I don't
need a new dress. I'm not
even sure if I want to go.

17:51.204 --> 17:53.240
Honey, it's prom.
You have to go.

17:53.273 --> 17:57.110
And besides, it'll help
keep your mind off Damon.

17:57.144 --> 17:59.246
Please go? For me?

17:59.279 --> 18:04.151
I've dreamed of seeing my
little girl go to prom
ever since you were littler.

18:04.184 --> 18:08.188
OK. But promise you
won't spend too much.
It's just a dress.

18:08.221 --> 18:11.591
Oh, I promise! I'm so excited!
My little girl's going to prom!

18:11.624 --> 18:14.261
Bye, Mom.

18:16.163 --> 18:17.530
Prom, prom, prom!

18:20.233 --> 18:24.271
- Good morning, Mr. Tanner.
- Good morning, Mrs. Kmetko.

18:24.304 --> 18:26.273
- Coffee?
- Oh, thank you.

18:26.306 --> 18:29.309
So I hear our daughters
are going to prom.

18:29.342 --> 18:32.645
Yeah. It's great, isn't it? I'm
off to pick up Emily a dress.

18:32.679 --> 18:36.216
Something elegant, yet flirty.
Understated, but sexy.

18:36.249 --> 18:40.153
Kick-ass, but... cheap.
[laughs]

18:40.187 --> 18:44.657
I have a personal shopper.
Why don't you let me just have
her pick something up for Emily.

18:44.691 --> 18:48.161
- Oh, no, Steve, no, no...
- Please.

18:48.195 --> 18:51.431
I want to.
It would give me great joy.

18:51.464 --> 18:55.568
- You have a personal shopper?
- You're welcome.

18:55.602 --> 18:58.205
[laughs] Thank you.

19:02.209 --> 19:06.179
- She's 15 minutes late.
- She is a doctor.
It could be worse.

19:06.213 --> 19:07.447
We could be standing here
in our underwear.

19:07.480 --> 19:12.252
Mr. and Mrs. Keeler,
I'm Dr. Anna Clijster.

19:12.285 --> 19:15.188
I am so sorry
to keep you waiting.

19:15.222 --> 19:17.224
Please sit.

19:17.257 --> 19:18.725
I wish I had a good excuse,

19:18.758 --> 19:21.394
but it's my addled
sense of direction.

19:21.428 --> 19:25.232
Please sit!
I was out for a run.

19:25.265 --> 19:26.633
Well, I got
completely turned around.

19:26.666 --> 19:30.203
Lost. But I'm here now.

19:30.237 --> 19:33.206
And I am so happy to meet you.

19:33.240 --> 19:37.344
- You didn't bring
your daughter?
- We...

19:37.377 --> 19:42.615
She's seen a lot of doctors and
it's always the same bad news.

19:42.649 --> 19:44.551
We didn't want to
get her hopes up again.

19:44.584 --> 19:46.219
I understand.

19:47.654 --> 19:49.756
How did you hear about
our daughter's injury?

19:49.789 --> 19:53.293
I saw it happen on TV.
She was tremendous.

19:53.326 --> 19:56.596
She was certain to make history
at the Olympics in 2012.

19:56.629 --> 19:59.666
And I strongly
believe she still can.

19:59.699 --> 20:03.703
Which is why,
when they invited me to
this conference here in Boulder,

20:03.736 --> 20:05.772
I felt it was inevitable.

20:05.805 --> 20:08.975
- Inevitable?
- Meant to be.

20:09.008 --> 20:13.980
OK. Payson has a
lumbosacral fracture,

20:14.013 --> 20:16.449
which up until now they
believed to be inoperable.

20:16.483 --> 20:19.452
- May I stop you?
- Of course.

20:19.486 --> 20:21.388
I have no doubt
you're a gifted surgeon,

20:21.421 --> 20:24.257
and you wouldn't
advocate this procedure

20:24.291 --> 20:26.526
- if you didn't
think it would work.
- That's correct.

20:26.559 --> 20:31.398
Payson isn't unable to walk,
she isn't in constant pain.

20:31.431 --> 20:35.702
She's healthy and she's able
to engage in normal activities.

20:35.735 --> 20:39.339
And she's a teenager with
her whole life ahead of her.

20:39.372 --> 20:40.540
So she doesn't need this.

20:40.573 --> 20:42.642
This is elective.
And there are risks.

20:42.675 --> 20:45.612
- There are risks
in any surgery.
- There's risk of paralysis.

20:47.814 --> 20:50.283
Yes, but it's
highly unlikely.

20:50.317 --> 20:52.719
That's the downside.
Not acceptable.

20:52.752 --> 20:55.522
Besides,
even if it did work,

20:55.555 --> 20:59.792
could you guarantee that
she'd be the same gymnast
she was before the injury?

20:59.826 --> 21:02.329
- The same gymnast?
- Yeah.

21:02.362 --> 21:04.597
We know our daughter.

21:04.631 --> 21:07.300
If she came back
with all this hope,

21:07.334 --> 21:10.069
and she couldn't reach the
same level she was before,

21:10.102 --> 21:12.305
she would be in constant agony.

21:12.339 --> 21:14.707
Can you guarantee
she'd be the same gymnast?

21:14.741 --> 21:17.444
Mrs. Keeler, only God
can give that guarantee.

21:17.477 --> 21:20.847
Thank you.
Then we're done here.

21:40.533 --> 21:45.772
- [rock music plays]
- [indistinct chatter]

21:46.873 --> 21:49.342
[laughing]

21:49.376 --> 21:53.346
Ah! My women return from
the great prom dress hunt.

21:53.380 --> 21:55.348
I see you bring me
abundant slaughter.

21:55.382 --> 21:57.817
I got the
prettiest dress, Dad.

21:57.850 --> 22:00.687
- And a manicure. Thanks, Mom.
- Of course.

22:00.720 --> 22:04.357
And Dr. Meyers said I can go
without my back brace tonight.

22:04.391 --> 22:07.760
- That's fantastic!
- Come on in, Heather.

22:07.794 --> 22:10.897
Major emergency!
The band just canceled.

22:10.930 --> 22:14.501
Swine flu! How are we gonna book
another band at the last minute?

22:14.534 --> 22:17.404
Prom is ruined!
And it's my bad.

22:17.437 --> 22:20.673
Uh... maybe not.
I know some guys in a band.

22:20.707 --> 22:24.777
Come on, we'll make some calls.
Come on! Let's get ready.

22:24.811 --> 22:27.414
So that's what a normal
teenage crisis looks like.

22:27.447 --> 22:29.115
Yes! Can you believe
that's our daughter?

22:29.148 --> 22:30.517
She's adjusting.

22:30.550 --> 22:34.521
She's more than adjusting.
She's happy.

22:34.554 --> 22:37.924
We just went shopping for
dresses, she's going to a prom.

22:37.957 --> 22:41.494
She doesn't know
she has another choice.

22:41.528 --> 22:44.764
Wait a minute, Mark.
You heard the doctor.

22:44.797 --> 22:47.400
Even if she made it
through surgery OK,

22:47.434 --> 22:49.536
there's no guarantee
she could compete.

22:49.569 --> 22:52.539
- I'm not advocating surgery.
- What are you advocating?

22:52.572 --> 22:54.941
The truth. At first,

22:54.974 --> 22:57.444
I felt like we were acting
in her best interest.

22:57.477 --> 23:01.548
But now, after meeting
the doctor, I feel like
we're hiding something from her.

23:01.581 --> 23:04.984
Can you honestly tell me
you feel good about this?
Because I don't.

23:07.920 --> 23:12.592
- [alarm beeps]
- [mid-tempo rock plays]

23:23.903 --> 23:27.707
[gasping] Thank you, Daddy!

23:35.214 --> 23:37.617
[rock music plays]

23:46.759 --> 23:48.828
[applause]

23:48.861 --> 23:51.498
That's my girl.
I knew you could do it.

23:51.531 --> 23:52.532
You needed to commit.

23:52.565 --> 23:54.867
We keep adding moves
like that into your routines,

23:54.901 --> 23:57.504
the Chinese won't
know what hit them.

24:03.943 --> 24:06.613
So do you know what
you're wearing to prom yet?

24:06.646 --> 24:08.915
- Um, my mom's...
- I'm wearing something new.

24:08.948 --> 24:10.483
And it's amazing.

24:10.517 --> 24:12.519
At first, my dad told me
I couldn't buy a new dress.

24:14.887 --> 24:18.525
But that's because he wanted
to buy it and surprise me.

24:18.558 --> 24:22.061
[sighs] And I just
happen to have the
perfect shoes to go with it.

24:26.533 --> 24:28.568
Great. Bye.

24:30.537 --> 24:33.940
That was my
personal shopper.

24:33.973 --> 24:37.510
She said she put
Emily's dress in my car.

24:37.544 --> 24:40.279
If you want to give me
the keys to your Sorrento,

24:40.312 --> 24:44.684
- I'll make the switch.
- Thank you, Steve.

24:46.018 --> 24:47.787
You know,
I could just...

24:47.820 --> 24:52.625
- ...kiss you right now.
- And, if we were anyplace else,

24:52.659 --> 24:54.961
I'd let you.

24:56.563 --> 25:01.067
Parents, I present
to you Miss Payson Keeler!

25:12.612 --> 25:13.780
How do I look?

25:15.915 --> 25:17.984
You look like a princess.

25:19.619 --> 25:22.655
You look beautiful, sweetheart.

25:22.689 --> 25:24.591
- Can the old man
give you a hug?
- You better.

25:24.624 --> 25:26.793
I haven't had a decent one
since I put the brace on.

25:26.826 --> 25:28.628
[laughing]

25:28.661 --> 25:30.863
[humming]

25:30.897 --> 25:34.000
- Aw, your first dance
of the night.
- [phone rings]

25:34.033 --> 25:36.969
- Beautiful.
- The limo driver. He's here.

25:37.003 --> 25:39.806
OK, I never thought
I'd be saying this, but...

25:39.839 --> 25:42.609
- ...I'm off to the prom.
- Wait! Let me get a picture!

25:42.642 --> 25:45.311
- Oh, Mom, we have to go.
- Just get in there.

25:45.344 --> 25:48.347
- OK. Here we go.
- Have fun. Have fun.

25:48.380 --> 25:51.017
- We will, we will.
- Good night,
Mr. and Mrs. Keeler.

25:51.050 --> 25:52.652
- I love you! Bye!
- I love you, too. Be careful.

25:52.685 --> 25:54.654
[Payson] We will!

26:00.627 --> 26:02.995
Maybe you're right.

26:03.029 --> 26:05.632
Maybe things
are better this way.

26:08.635 --> 26:13.873
Limo's on its way.
Mrs. Keeler called
to say it'll be here in...

26:13.906 --> 26:16.042
Why aren't you dressed?

26:19.045 --> 26:21.881
I don't know.
Why aren't I?

26:27.954 --> 26:30.723
[clears throat] What do
you think I should wear?

26:30.757 --> 26:34.060
Uh, you want me to
pick out your prom dress?

26:34.093 --> 26:38.030
- Yes, please.
- No, uh-uh,
I can't win that one.

26:38.064 --> 26:41.367
You've got too many
to choose from, all beautiful.

26:41.400 --> 26:45.104
- You decide.
- Wait! Aren't you
forgetting something?

26:45.137 --> 26:46.773
Oh...

26:48.708 --> 26:50.076
Have a wonderful prom.

26:50.109 --> 26:55.114
And, in case you guys decide
to stop somewhere after...

27:04.223 --> 27:08.194
- [rock music plays]
- This is so exciting!

27:08.227 --> 27:10.963
It almost wasn't! The band
canceled at the last minute,

27:10.997 --> 27:13.666
- but Payson saved the day.
- Yay, Payson.

27:13.700 --> 27:15.935
Oh, here are the boys.
Who's this twerp?

27:15.968 --> 27:19.105
- I'm Miller.
- This is who you brought?

27:19.138 --> 27:22.742
There weren't many takers.
And Miller's a medalist.

27:22.775 --> 27:25.678
Junior medalist.
I got this for you.

27:26.846 --> 27:29.716
Great. Three girls,
one and a half dates.

27:29.749 --> 27:32.418
- You look beautiful.
- Thanks. Uh...

27:32.451 --> 27:34.754
But you should probably
give that to Payson.

27:34.787 --> 27:39.458
- It is her prom.
- Thanks, Carter.

27:39.491 --> 27:41.694
Aren't you gonna
tell me I look beautiful?

27:41.728 --> 27:43.830
Is that the surprise dress
your dad bought you?

27:43.863 --> 27:46.866
No. Apparently, he gave it
to that tramp he's dating.

27:48.968 --> 27:51.203
* Who do you think you are? *

27:58.210 --> 28:00.813
- Hey, everybody!
- [applause]

28:00.847 --> 28:03.816
- We are the Shelter Pups!
- [cheering]

28:03.850 --> 28:08.988
Ow! And this, this,
this is your prom!

28:09.021 --> 28:11.457

- Kick it!

28:13.292 --> 28:17.263
You got the Shelter Pups?
Does Emily know?

28:17.296 --> 28:22.134
- Not exactly.
- Emily is going to freak.

28:22.168 --> 28:26.305
Oh, this is totally gonna be
like a John Hughes movie! Whoo!

28:33.245 --> 28:35.147

straight into a tree *

28:41.320 --> 28:45.257
[man] All right, ladies, smile!
Come together.

28:45.291 --> 28:47.827
* But it's not up to me

28:47.860 --> 28:52.765
- Thanks.
- So would you like to dance?

28:52.799 --> 28:56.903
Actually, I'm pretty
beat from training.

28:56.936 --> 28:59.238
I don't think I'm gonna dance.
But thanks.

29:03.275 --> 29:08.114
- [upbeat dance music plays]
- Hey. Don't you two
both look lovely.

29:08.147 --> 29:10.917
Razor, thank you so much for
filling in on such short notice.

29:10.950 --> 29:14.821
Yeah, absolutely. At a great
personal sacrifice, I must add.

29:14.854 --> 29:20.192
- [laughs]
- But if I'm on stage all night,
how can I dance with my date?

29:20.226 --> 29:22.094
- [laughter]
- Where is my date?

29:32.972 --> 29:35.141
[gasps]

29:35.174 --> 29:39.979
Be still my beating,
little heart!

29:41.047 --> 29:42.982
Mom, this is beautiful.

29:43.983 --> 29:46.318
How much did you spend?

29:46.352 --> 29:50.022
Practically nothing.
Don't worry. I swear.

29:51.991 --> 29:55.828
Now, give me a hug.
Come here.

29:55.862 --> 30:01.868
Honey, you are gonna make
such a splash in that dress.

30:03.936 --> 30:08.007
- [R'n'B plays]
- No way. Ike Benziger?

30:08.040 --> 30:10.142
At a prom?
This has to be a joke.

30:12.011 --> 30:14.613
* I remember sitting
on a hill *

30:14.646 --> 30:18.284
* Watching that
big sun go down *

30:18.317 --> 30:21.387
- Ike.
- Wow.

30:21.420 --> 30:24.223
You look... awesome.

30:25.391 --> 30:29.295
Payson, would you
honor me with a dance?

30:32.398 --> 30:34.967
Look, I'm dyin' here.

30:36.302 --> 30:39.371
I know I'm a jerk,
and I'm sorry.

30:40.439 --> 30:43.976
I rented this suit and got
a ticket just to say that.

30:44.010 --> 30:47.246
Will you dance with me?

30:47.279 --> 30:48.314
Please?

* When you got someone
who wants to give
you everything *

you thought you never
would experience *

he shows you it's reality *

31:02.061 --> 31:06.265
* Nothing can compare

31:06.298 --> 31:09.201
You're the last person
I expected to see at the prom.

31:10.970 --> 31:14.907
Don't you
find it... pointless?

31:14.941 --> 31:19.211
- OK, I deserve that.
- Go on.

31:20.446 --> 31:23.682
I'm sorry I trashed
everything you believe in.

31:23.715 --> 31:26.352
I thought about
what you said, and...

31:26.385 --> 31:30.456
...maybe it's my philosophy
that's pointless.

31:30.489 --> 31:32.024
What are you saying?

31:32.058 --> 31:34.193
There might actually
be something in your life

31:34.226 --> 31:39.265
- you could be passionate about?
- Whoa, easy Pay-Pay.

31:39.298 --> 31:41.667
I'm not there yet.

31:41.700 --> 31:43.970
I'm just saying...
[sighing]

...I'm open to it.

like to dance?

31:58.350 --> 32:00.987
Um, you know,
I probably shouldn't.

32:01.020 --> 32:02.521
You can't come to
a prom and not dance.

32:04.423 --> 32:07.493

* Can I turn it around?

- Oh.

- Now you want to dance?
- Mmm-hmm.

32:28.747 --> 32:32.451
Well, forget it. You used me
to get back at Kaylie once.

32:32.484 --> 32:34.286
You're not going
to use me again.

32:34.320 --> 32:36.722
You know, you called
me pathetic once.

32:36.755 --> 32:40.292
But if Kaylie out there
dancing with some anonymous
high school boy instead of you

32:40.326 --> 32:42.328
doesn't make you
feel like a fool,

32:42.361 --> 32:44.230
then you're
the pathetic one.

32:46.198 --> 32:48.434
* It's good to be you

32:48.467 --> 32:52.371
* Yeah, you got it together

Look, I'm sorry I didn't
say thank you for the
Valentine's Day flowers.

33:11.323 --> 33:14.060
I'm sorry I said I wouldn't
dance with you. It's just...

33:14.093 --> 33:18.364
- I'm your safety net.
- What? What do you mean?

33:18.397 --> 33:20.566
As long as I'm there,
dangling on a string,

33:20.599 --> 33:25.304
- you don't have to commit.
- Carter, you broke my heart.

33:25.337 --> 33:28.507
And you're breaking mine,
every day.

33:28.540 --> 33:31.377
Look, I'm sorry,
I'm just... I'm confused.

33:31.410 --> 33:34.580
I understand that.
But I suddenly realized

33:34.613 --> 33:37.183
that while I'm waiting
on you to forgive me,

33:37.216 --> 33:41.420
- you might be looking
for another boyfriend.
- I'm not looking for anyone.

33:41.453 --> 33:45.557
I love you, Kaylie,
and I believe you love me, too.

33:45.591 --> 33:49.261
But I'm tired of trying to
convince you how sorry I am.

33:49.295 --> 33:52.298
If you can't forgive me,
I'm moving on.

33:52.331 --> 33:53.365
I have to.

my extremely fetching prom date,

in a stunning dress.

34:17.489 --> 34:21.493
- Miss Emily Kmetko.
- [playing rock music]

34:23.295 --> 34:25.397
Your date? You didn't tell
me Emily was gonna be here.

34:25.431 --> 34:28.500
They were desperate
for a band, dude.
I didn't think you'd show.

34:36.508 --> 34:39.645
- Emily, you look amazing.
- The Shelter Pups?

34:39.678 --> 34:42.348
OK, out of all
the bands in Boulder...

34:42.381 --> 34:45.184
I'm sorry, I didn't
get a chance to tell you.

34:45.217 --> 34:48.187
But the band fell out
at the last minute.

- What? That's crazy.
- She's wearing the dress!

35:08.674 --> 35:10.476
The dress that I thought
he bought for me!

35:10.509 --> 35:12.911
Wasn't Emily at Payson's
the night your dad

35:12.944 --> 35:15.614
was in the garage apartment
with his new girlfriend?

35:15.647 --> 35:18.584
Oh. Right.

35:18.617 --> 35:22.188
- Yeah.
- Whoo!

35:22.221 --> 35:25.457
Well, then where
did she get the dress?

- Me, too.
- You know, Lo, your shoes

35:34.600 --> 35:37.436
- go really great
with Emily's dress.
- Where's it from?

35:37.469 --> 35:39.705
- Um, I don't know.
My mom got it.
- Really?

35:39.738 --> 35:42.208
Your mom can
afford a $600 Jovani?

35:42.241 --> 35:44.510
Because that is a
designer dress.

35:44.543 --> 35:46.745
My mom would never spend
that much money on a dress.

35:48.414 --> 35:51.417
Unless her boyfriend bought it.
She said he's really rich.

dating Emily Kmetko.
- Duh.

- Wow.

36:57.516 --> 37:00.586
- He doesn't sing in public.
- I know.

It looks like
he's gonna start.

- No, no, no, it's not!

It's not! Do you know
why I was in jail?

37:49.468 --> 37:53.305
I was arrested
for buying stolen equipment
that I didn't know was hot.

37:53.339 --> 37:57.476
I just wanted to record my song,
the song that I wrote for you.

37:57.509 --> 37:59.311
I wanted to show you
that I had a plan.

37:59.345 --> 38:01.447
That I was worthy
of being with you.

38:01.480 --> 38:04.450
That I had the courage
to get up there
and sing my own damn song.

38:04.483 --> 38:07.786
I was gonna show you
that tonight, but...

You still don't get it.

38:13.892 --> 38:16.328
Showing up when you
don't feel worthy,

38:16.362 --> 38:18.330
keeping your word when
it's not convenient,

38:18.364 --> 38:23.335
just being there when
someone is hurting or scared

38:23.369 --> 38:25.537
or just needs
to hear your voice,

38:25.571 --> 38:28.640
that's all I want from you.

38:28.674 --> 38:30.509
Not some song.

38:30.542 --> 38:33.445
Spoken like
the winner that you are.

38:34.145 --> 38:36.582
And deserve to be with.

38:41.520 --> 38:45.123
The Shelter Pups will be back...
I hope.

38:45.156 --> 38:47.826
In the meantime, I'd like
to take this opportunity

38:47.859 --> 38:51.630
to thank the newest member
of the prom committee,
Payson Keeler,

38:51.663 --> 38:54.633
who nabbed the Shelter Pups
and saved our prom.

38:54.666 --> 38:57.536
- Let's hear it for Payson!
- [applause]

38:57.569 --> 38:59.505
[chanting] Payson! Payson!

39:17.689 --> 39:20.692
Hey. I've known
Damon for a long time.

39:20.726 --> 39:25.497
And I've never seen him go on
stage in front of a group of
people and try to sing a song.

39:25.531 --> 39:28.434
For him to do that,

39:28.467 --> 39:30.836
it must only mean
one thing, Emily.

39:30.869 --> 39:34.873
He loves you. And then
you running after him,

39:34.906 --> 39:38.510
that can only
mean one thing, too.

39:40.579 --> 39:42.881
I don't want him
to be anything but who he is.

39:42.914 --> 39:44.950
I don't buy that.

39:44.983 --> 39:48.920
You want more.
And so does he.

39:48.954 --> 39:52.591
Hey.

39:52.624 --> 39:55.727
You gotta let him find
a way to go for it, Emily.

39:56.862 --> 39:58.497
I'm just sayin'.

40:00.666 --> 40:03.535
I will see you around,
Miss Emily Kmetko.

40:08.206 --> 40:10.509
[soft rock plays]

40:12.511 --> 40:14.546
[sobbing]

40:19.551 --> 40:21.920
I will never ever
forget my prom.

40:22.888 --> 40:24.990
Because it sucked.

40:25.023 --> 40:27.225
I didn't even get to dance.

40:27.258 --> 40:29.761
My dad is dating Chloe Kmetko.

40:31.497 --> 40:34.466
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know yet.

40:34.500 --> 40:37.503
But I will not
have her as a step-mother.

40:37.536 --> 40:40.906
Or Emily as a step-sister.

40:40.939 --> 40:45.544
I will not let my dad
buy her expensive gifts
instead of me.

40:45.577 --> 40:50.716
If my mom hadn't bailed on me,
I wouldn't be in this mess.

40:50.749 --> 40:54.953
I wish, just once,

40:54.986 --> 40:57.589
someone would choose me.

40:58.790 --> 41:02.460
[sniffling, sobbing]

41:03.529 --> 41:06.632
* My love, love, love

41:06.665 --> 41:10.602
* This town
is overwhelming me *

41:10.636 --> 41:13.905
[music gets louder]

41:13.939 --> 41:18.510
* And I hope
I hope there's time *

41:18.544 --> 41:21.647
- * For everything
- Would you like to dance?

41:31.757 --> 41:33.592
It's OK.

41:35.293 --> 41:37.763
* What do you want to find?

41:37.796 --> 41:40.566
* Separate the wrong
from right *

41:40.599 --> 41:45.737
* That's the enemy
Why don't you choose to see? *

41:45.771 --> 41:50.942
* It's a better way
Less work, a lot more play *

41:50.976 --> 41:56.948
* Come look inside
I'm there where you hide *

41:56.982 --> 42:00.686
* Time's overwhelming me

42:03.989 --> 42:08.093
* I hope there's time

42:08.126 --> 42:10.929
* For everything

42:13.632 --> 42:16.301
* My love, love, love

42:16.334 --> 42:20.972
* This town
is overwhelming me *

42:24.042 --> 42:27.345
- * And I hope, I hope...
- Oh...

42:27.378 --> 42:30.649
Stop torturing yourself.

42:30.682 --> 42:33.719
It's not about hiding
something from Payson.

42:33.752 --> 42:36.021
It's about
protecting her.

42:36.054 --> 42:38.590
From hurt.
From disappointment.

42:38.624 --> 42:42.761
I know.
It's just...

42:42.794 --> 42:45.797
...we raise our kids to be
honest with us, to trust us.

42:45.831 --> 42:49.334
But how can we expect them
to have the courage

42:49.367 --> 42:53.338
to share the truth,
regardless the consequences,

42:53.371 --> 42:56.107
- when we're afraid
to do the same?
- [door shuts]

42:57.408 --> 42:59.611
Hey! You're still up?

42:59.645 --> 43:01.813
- Hey!
- Our daughter's first prom.

43:01.847 --> 43:05.383
- How could we sleep?
- How was it? Come in.
Tell us all about it.

43:05.416 --> 43:07.753
It was so much fun.

43:07.786 --> 43:11.823
Emily knows these guys in a
band, and I got them to play,
and they were a huge hit.

43:11.857 --> 43:15.393
And... so was I.

43:15.426 --> 43:19.030
- That's wonderful.
- I'm glad you enjoyed yourself.

43:19.064 --> 43:21.099
Yeah. So how was your night?

43:28.173 --> 43:29.808
Honey, why don't
you sit down?

43:34.980 --> 43:38.183
Your father and I have something
we want to share with you.

43:38.216 --> 43:43.421
* For every...

43:43.454 --> 43:45.691
* ...thing *
