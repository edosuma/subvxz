03:07.103 --> 03:10.189
Without a doubt, this will
be one of the best museum exhibitions

03:10.356 --> 03:12.233
Gotham City has ever seen.

03:12.525 --> 03:15.444
You can be quite the humanitarian
on occasion, Bruce.

03:15.903 --> 03:18.698
It's commendable. It's inspiring.

03:18.781 --> 03:21.701
- It's deductible.
- The Scroll of Osiris.

03:21.992 --> 03:23.953
Pity only half of it exists.

03:24.203 --> 03:27.164
It's the oldest Egyptian document
known to man.

03:28.124 --> 03:29.333
Yeah.

03:30.126 --> 03:32.503
Oops!
I gotta go meet Tammy at Charday's.

03:33.379 --> 03:35.423
Hmm. Such a pity.

04:14.754 --> 04:16.130
Now, let's have a look at you.

04:17.631 --> 04:18.966
Ubu?

04:19.341 --> 04:22.178
You could've been
my successor, Detective.

04:22.762 --> 04:26.348
Instead, you will suffer the fate
of all mortal flesh.

05:11.852 --> 05:13.062
Snake venom?

05:13.437 --> 05:16.732
From an Egyptian cobra.
Extremely deadly.

05:16.941 --> 05:20.277
- You're certain it was Ra's AI Ghul?
- None other.

05:20.569 --> 05:22.655
But I thought he died
in the Pit months ago.

05:23.280 --> 05:24.281
So did I.

05:24.657 --> 05:27.535
That piece of papyrus is obviously
very important to him.

05:27.993 --> 05:30.704
- I have to find out why.
- Where are you off to now?

05:30.788 --> 05:32.373
Just in case the stockholders ask.

05:33.290 --> 05:36.126
Gibraltar. There's someone
I've been meaning to look up.

06:47.489 --> 06:48.824
Beloved?

06:57.333 --> 06:59.376
My father? Alive?

07:00.169 --> 07:02.463
It was dear old dad, no mistake.

07:03.047 --> 07:06.550
No, he would have found me.
He would have told me he was alive.

07:06.717 --> 07:09.511
I know the face of my most
powerful enemy, Talia.

07:09.762 --> 07:12.389
He took quite a risk
stealing that scroll from me.

07:12.473 --> 07:14.016
Why does he want it so badly?

07:14.433 --> 07:15.726
It's part of a map.

07:16.477 --> 07:17.978
My father has the other half.

07:18.479 --> 07:22.107
As long as I can remember
he's been obsessed with finding...

07:22.441 --> 07:23.484
Finding what?

07:23.734 --> 07:26.111
The tomb of the ancient
queen Thoth Khepera.

07:26.695 --> 07:28.948
It lies somewhere
in the Canyon of Tombs.

07:29.365 --> 07:31.075
Many who've sought it have vanished.

07:31.367 --> 07:32.618
And why does Ra's seek it?

07:33.035 --> 07:34.203
I don't know.

07:34.578 --> 07:35.788
You must believe me.

07:36.288 --> 07:38.958
I have to go after him, Talia.
Will you help me?

07:39.166 --> 07:43.295
You are so like him,
making me choose between the two of you.

07:43.379 --> 07:46.006
Oh, beloved, why has he forsaken me?

07:46.340 --> 07:47.841
Does he think I've betrayed him?

07:48.050 --> 07:50.386
I can't pretend to know
what Ra's thinks, Talia.

07:51.220 --> 07:55.182
The only thing he and I have ever
agreed upon is our feelings towards you.

08:02.106 --> 08:05.442
My father used to have
a hidden sanctuary in Cairo.

08:05.526 --> 08:08.445
- Perhaps he still uses it.
- It's worth a try.

08:21.083 --> 08:23.794
Artifacts from the king's tomb.

08:23.961 --> 08:25.754
- Every one's a valuable treasure.
- In here.

08:25.921 --> 08:28.757
- This place looks familiar.
- Guaranteed authentic.

08:34.763 --> 08:36.265
How may I help you?

08:36.557 --> 08:37.599
We're just browsing.

08:37.850 --> 08:41.353
You could find no finer place
than this establishment

08:41.562 --> 08:44.815
in which to obtain wondrous bargains.

08:45.190 --> 08:46.608
This, for example,

08:46.942 --> 08:49.903
a priceless relic
from the Seventh Dynasty.

08:50.320 --> 08:51.530
The only one of its kind.

08:54.324 --> 08:55.826
Another time, perhaps.

08:56.869 --> 08:57.870
Hmm.

08:59.705 --> 09:01.540
This is the place. I'm sure of it.

09:01.790 --> 09:03.876
There's a secret entrance
to a lower level,

09:03.959 --> 09:05.335
but I don't remember where.

09:05.711 --> 09:06.795
This might help us.

09:08.964 --> 09:10.340
An ultrasound imager.

09:17.181 --> 09:19.016
Eureka.

09:31.153 --> 09:34.782
This part of the store
is closed to customers.

10:04.228 --> 10:06.647
- We make a good team.
- That we do.

10:22.996 --> 10:24.540
The completed scroll?

10:24.623 --> 10:27.042
Yes,
and a translation made by Ra's.

10:28.627 --> 10:31.046
Did you really think
I would be foolish enough

10:31.130 --> 10:34.007
not to have this sanctum
under observation?

10:37.052 --> 10:39.930
Father! You really are alive.

10:40.013 --> 10:41.932
Yes, Talia, I am alive.

10:42.474 --> 10:46.854
No thanks, I regret to say, are due you
for my current state of health.

10:47.312 --> 10:49.648
No, Father, you can't believe that.

10:49.898 --> 10:52.234
I only tried to save the man I love.

10:52.317 --> 10:54.945
You've got a serious
priority problem, Ra's.

10:55.237 --> 10:58.991
What can be in that tomb that's more
valuable than the love of your daughter?

10:59.491 --> 11:01.034
Power, Detective.

11:01.410 --> 11:06.165
The power once held by almighty
Thoth Khepera, queen of two continents.

11:06.665 --> 11:08.333
You surprise me, Ra's.

11:08.625 --> 11:11.295
The world's oldest chauvinist
chasing after a woman?

11:11.587 --> 11:15.048
Thoth Khepera
was not simply a woman, Detective,

11:15.591 --> 11:16.925
nor merely a ruler.

11:17.342 --> 11:20.179
Through her flowed
the power of the gods.

11:20.262 --> 11:21.680
With no more than a gesture,

11:21.763 --> 11:24.141
she controlled
the force of life and death,

11:24.391 --> 11:29.313
and with it she kept a nation
under her thumb for 1,000 years.

11:29.605 --> 11:32.357
You sound like a bad
Saturday afternoon serial, Ra's.

11:32.566 --> 11:35.360
- This is sheer nonsense.
- No, Detective.

11:35.444 --> 11:37.654
I know there is a power there
to be tapped.

11:38.071 --> 11:40.949
My 600 years of life
are proof of that power.

11:45.162 --> 11:46.705
Farewell, Detective.

11:47.164 --> 11:48.457
Farewell, Talia.

11:48.540 --> 11:52.294
It is said that one finds immortality
in one's offspring.

11:53.086 --> 11:55.589
Alas, I know that to be a lie.

12:09.770 --> 12:11.647
The air won't last much longer.

12:12.105 --> 12:14.191
It's not the end
I would've chosen, beloved,

12:14.608 --> 12:17.027
but if we must die,
I am glad we're together.

12:17.361 --> 12:18.612
We're not licked yet.

12:31.500 --> 12:33.877
Cover your ears, Talia, and pray.

12:49.559 --> 12:52.396
Talia, I'll do whatever I have to
to stop him.

12:52.980 --> 12:54.189
You must know that.

12:54.398 --> 12:56.900
I do. And though it breaks my heart,

12:57.401 --> 12:59.194
I will do what I must as well.

13:22.843 --> 13:25.595
No sign of Ra's.
Looks like we beat him here.

13:26.221 --> 13:29.850
- How did you know where to find it?
- I saw the scroll's translation.

13:30.058 --> 13:31.184
For only a moment.

13:32.269 --> 13:33.437
I'm a quick study.

13:55.125 --> 13:56.668
The queen's sarcophagus.

13:57.377 --> 13:59.296
It's not what it seems, Detective.

13:59.629 --> 14:00.756
Father!

14:01.006 --> 14:04.468
That chest contains
more than a mummy's corpse.

14:04.968 --> 14:07.679
Remember, Thoth Khepera was immortal.

14:07.888 --> 14:09.973
Her subjects deified her,

14:10.182 --> 14:14.186
named her after the ancient gods
of infinite knowledge and eternal life.

14:14.269 --> 14:16.104
And in a few short moments

14:16.188 --> 14:21.526
I will be privy to those same secrets
of life and death.

14:43.924 --> 14:45.008
No-

16:06.882 --> 16:08.133
Who are you?

16:08.550 --> 16:10.802
I am Thoth Khepera.

16:11.303 --> 16:14.890
Those who have joined me
share their knowledge with me.

16:15.307 --> 16:16.892
We are legion.

16:17.517 --> 16:19.811
I am called Ra's AI Ghul.

16:20.687 --> 16:24.149
I have searched for you
for over 500 years.

16:24.691 --> 16:26.526
Tell me your secret.

16:27.027 --> 16:31.531
Grant me the powers of the gods
that legend says you possessed.

16:31.907 --> 16:35.368
That knowledge can be yours
if you join us.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.336
Come forward, Ra's AI Ghul.

16:45.003 --> 16:48.632
Come and know the mysteries
of life and death.

17:07.526 --> 17:08.777
Father.

17:39.933 --> 17:43.937
None may defile me and live.

18:09.170 --> 18:10.171
Talia!

18:44.289 --> 18:45.290
Run!

18:48.418 --> 18:50.045
Keep going and don't look back.

18:50.128 --> 18:52.964
I'll do what I can to stop that thing.

20:17.590 --> 20:18.842
Daughter.

20:19.300 --> 20:20.343
Father.

20:27.600 --> 20:29.728
My apologies to you, daughter.

20:31.104 --> 20:35.316
Though I had abandoned you in my heart,
obviously, you have not done the same.

20:47.495 --> 20:51.040
- What will you do now?
- Take them back to the authorities.

20:51.541 --> 20:53.501
Your father has much to answer for.

20:55.670 --> 20:59.716
I am truly sorry, beloved,
but he is my father.

21:02.844 --> 21:04.596
Please dismount.

21:17.734 --> 21:19.652
Another time, Detective.

21:34.209 --> 21:36.961
Yes, another time.

22:17.794 --> 22:18.795
English - SDH
