only war and fluoride can.

00:33.133 --> 00:34.578
She's gonna ask you for a chamomile.

00:34.668 --> 00:36.375
She doesn't want chamomile.
She wants peppermint.

00:36.470 --> 00:39.474
Okay? She gets a little confused,
but do not point it out.

00:39.640 --> 00:42.746

What, you guys went
to the bathroom together?

05:14.948 --> 05:16.484
I was actually thinking of something,

05:16.583 --> 05:19.427
which is how to squash
the first story of your campaign.

05:19.486 --> 05:20.590
Which is what?

05:20.654 --> 05:23.294
The fact that you started your campaign
without a campaign manager.

05:23.423 --> 05:26.199
Oh. Possibly without a press guy, too.

Let me tell you something.

Let's look at why the press don't like you,
and they don't.

The answer is Mike McLintock.

06:20.513 --> 06:21.685
Well, that makes sense, yeah.

06:21.748 --> 06:24.752
And then we have Dan.
He's all eyelashes and teeth.

06:24.851 --> 06:27.354
- He'd make a good croupier.
- He would make a good croupier.

06:27.420 --> 06:30.230
Never thought of that.
He's very good at reading people, you know?

Right, hitting on drunk divorcees, yeah.
That's his level.

06:33.260 --> 06:38.334
So you are suggesting losing Dan and Mike?

06:38.565 --> 06:40.670
- Amy would be...
- Does she know you're here?

06:40.901 --> 06:43.177
- No, of course not.
- You should fire her for that.

06:43.336 --> 06:45.213
I wouldn't let you within a mile
of someone like me.

06:45.272 --> 06:47.013
Fire her, now.

06:47.073 --> 06:49.075
- I hadn't thought about...
- Then it's time you did.

06:49.676 --> 06:51.212
- Bill?
- Yes.

06:51.278 --> 06:53.224
If we are gonna work together,

06:53.280 --> 06:55.556
you really do need to make an effort

06:55.615 --> 06:58.687
not to interrupt me all the time
because I find that a little...

06:58.752 --> 07:00.390

- Mmm-hmm.

But you know, he's my asshole.

07:14.367 --> 07:17.314
- You need a better asshole.
- All right, so, lose Gary, I guess.

07:17.637 --> 07:20.243
- And then, what, I fire everyone?
- Mmm-hmm.

07:20.573 --> 07:22.052

would like to meet this weekend.

we need to stop Maddox from running.

08:46.826 --> 08:47.827
I know that, Ame.

08:47.961 --> 08:49.235
Offer something shiny, like State.

08:49.329 --> 08:51.138
Mike, you're gonna come with me.

08:51.798 --> 08:53.141
- Me?
- SELINA: Yeah.

08:53.199 --> 08:54.542
- Really?
- Yeah.

08:54.634 --> 08:58.480
Um...I have really
important stuff to do here, ma'am.

08:58.571 --> 09:01.916
Oh. I'm so sorry.
Am I keeping you from anything?

09:02.075 --> 09:04.214
Yeah, but...

09:04.310 --> 09:06.312
- I guess I could do it in the country.
- (GARY EXCLAIMS)

09:07.147 --> 09:09.024
Don't you have allergies, Mike?

09:09.082 --> 09:11.528
Oh, I do actually have allergies.

09:12.052 --> 09:14.430
You do know that this isn't a hobby?

09:14.754 --> 09:16.495
- Right?
- What isn't a hobby?

09:16.756 --> 09:18.702
- This job.
- Oh. (CHUCKLES)

09:18.992 --> 09:20.562
- Of course I know that.
- Yep.

09:22.228 --> 09:24.071
SELINA: What in the loving fuck?

09:24.164 --> 09:25.404
Ma'am, I could go.

09:25.498 --> 09:27.375
I can! choose either of you guys to go

09:27.434 --> 09:30.244
because then it's gonna show
some sort of campaign manager bias

09:30.336 --> 09:31.406
and you'll freak out.

09:31.504 --> 09:33.006
- AMY: No, we could go with that.
- I can put that aside.

09:33.073 --> 09:34.950
- Seriously?
- Of course.

09:35.041 --> 09:37.078
- All right' then. Dan, you're coming.
- Yes.

09:37.177 --> 09:40.590
- Perfect. Well, actually, I have a load of...
- Laundry to do?

09:40.747 --> 09:42.590
- Strategy docs to work on.
- Good.

09:42.682 --> 09:44.889
- DAN: You falling behind there, Ames?
- No, I'm keeping ahead.

09:45.018 --> 09:47.862
Really? 'Cause, you know,
I can do that on the run, so...

09:48.388 --> 09:50.197
(SIRENS BLARING)

09:53.193 --> 09:55.639
People like Maddox
always have guns on the walls

09:55.728 --> 09:57.366
next to the animal heads.

09:57.530 --> 10:00.602
It's like a flowchart
for people who don't know what firearms do.

10:00.700 --> 10:02.202
(DAN LAUGHING)

10:02.702 --> 10:05.205
- Madam Vice President.
- Oh, George.

10:05.371 --> 10:06.441
GEORGE: Come on in.
SELINA: Thank you.

10:06.539 --> 10:09.418
It's so good to see you. Is Eleanor here?

10:09.476 --> 10:12.980
No she's not, thankfully. She's not a fan.

10:13.079 --> 10:14.888
Of political talk, I mean.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.985
Oh, I see. Right.

10:17.117 --> 10:20.291
These are just... (CHUCKLES)
In your face.

10:20.720 --> 10:23.257
- In a kind of fantastic way.
- Yeah.

10:23.423 --> 10:25.425
Yeah. Did you kill these?

10:25.892 --> 10:27.394
No, they were pre-killed.

10:27.460 --> 10:28.768
(CHUCKLES) on, right.

10:29.329 --> 10:31.002
Jake, could you get their bags?

10:31.097 --> 10:33.509
- Yes, sir.
- Oh. Hi, "Jake."

10:34.934 --> 10:36.811
You're Maddox's bagman?

10:37.270 --> 10:40.149
- That's quite a demotion.
- I'm sorry?

10:40.240 --> 10:42.743
I have several responsibilities
for Secretary Maddox.

10:42.809 --> 10:45.119
And I think you'll find
I'm quite the Renaissance Man.

10:45.245 --> 10:47.657
Well, please, by all means, Leonardo.

10:47.747 --> 10:48.748
Yes. Chop-chop.

10:48.815 --> 10:51.659
I want to thank you for agreeing
to come and go fishing with me.

10:51.751 --> 10:54.459
Yeah, I can't wait to get out on the water.
What kind of boat do you have?

10:54.921 --> 10:56.264
I don't have a boat.

10:56.589 --> 10:59.195
SELINA: This is the most
lovely setting, isn't it?

10:59.592 --> 11:01.367
It's a beautiful day.

11:01.928 --> 11:03.805
DAN: Okay, here, come on.
SELINA: I got it. There.

11:03.863 --> 11:05.035
GARY: Ah, ah, ah.

11:05.131 --> 11:06.508
Oh, I'm sorry, George. Pardon me.

11:06.633 --> 11:09.170
Okay, that's fine. Get away from...

11:09.435 --> 11:11.108
DAN: Gary, come on.
GARY: My God.

11:11.771 --> 11:13.011
Have you fished before?

11:13.106 --> 11:14.107
Um...

11:14.340 --> 11:15.375
Uh, yeah.

11:15.475 --> 11:16.783
GEORGE: Yeah?

11:19.112 --> 11:20.785
Oh... (CLEARS THROAT)

11:21.948 --> 11:24.519
That's a nice cast.
Right out into the center of the water.

11:24.684 --> 11:26.357
Well, that's where I like to be.

11:26.553 --> 11:28.294
Right in the center of the action.

11:28.354 --> 11:29.856
- You and me both.
- (CHUCKLES)

11:30.456 --> 11:33.869
What about Chung?
You think he's gonna run, George?

11:33.960 --> 11:35.337
- I hope not.
- Yeah.

11:35.395 --> 11:37.534
We can't have a war tourist
in the White House.

11:37.630 --> 11:40.076
- Ha.
- He talks the talk, but all he did in Iraq

11:40.166 --> 11:41.577
was wait for the bombing to stop,

11:41.668 --> 11:43.375
then post Facebook photos of himself

11:43.469 --> 11:45.312
sitting on a gold-plated bidet.

11:45.471 --> 11:47.382
(LAUGHING)

11:47.473 --> 11:50.477
JONAH: That's a good stance, sir.
Good solid base.

11:50.810 --> 11:52.585
I'd hate to be a fish in your river.

11:52.812 --> 11:54.689
- Shut up.
- SELINA: George...

11:54.814 --> 11:56.987
If I were in the Oval Office,

11:57.217 --> 12:00.892
you know, I could really use
somebody like you in State.

12:01.354 --> 12:03.265
If I was State, hypothetically...

12:03.356 --> 12:04.391
SELINA: Oh!
GARY: Ooh.

12:04.490 --> 12:05.560
Oh, look at that!

12:05.658 --> 12:07.035
- That is heavy!
- DAN: Reel him in.

12:07.093 --> 12:08.663
- (DAN CHUCKLING)
- SELINA: Look at that!

12:08.995 --> 12:10.235
- Look how big that thing is!
- Oh, yeah!

12:10.330 --> 12:11.331
DAN: Okay! Oh!

12:11.497 --> 12:12.498
BOTH: Whoa!

12:12.565 --> 12:13.908
GARY: How exciting!

12:14.000 --> 12:15.673
SELINA: Oh, no!
DAN: Where'd he go? Aw!

12:15.835 --> 12:17.508
- Did you lose him?
- Oh, he got away.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.015
You fucking idiot.

12:19.505 --> 12:21.678
MIKE: <i>This is so nice of you, Amy.</i>

12:21.908 --> 12:24.081
Oh, there was a seating plan.

12:24.577 --> 12:26.682
- KENT: Ah, I'm sorry.
- But it is absolutely fine.

12:26.746 --> 12:29.454
I'm going to top up some wine.

12:29.616 --> 12:31.186
- You have... You need some...
- Actually, I don't... No, no.

12:31.251 --> 12:32.423
MIKE: Oh!

12:32.518 --> 12:34.020
It's okay. It's okay.

12:34.087 --> 12:35.259
- AMY: No.
- Don't rub it, Mike.

12:35.355 --> 12:36.527
- I'm making it worse.
- AMY: Yeah.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.364
I was gonna get a new rug, so...

12:38.524 --> 12:40.970
I could take a dump on it,
if you need a clincher.

12:41.060 --> 12:42.300
KENT: Oh, thank you, Ben.

12:42.395 --> 12:44.602
This is great wine, Amy.

12:44.697 --> 12:46.142
A lot better than I anticipated.

12:46.232 --> 12:48.769
And she has got a real nose for wine.

12:48.868 --> 12:50.438
You remember that soiree
at the French embassy,

12:50.536 --> 12:53.073
where you were identifying
the year by the smell?

12:53.139 --> 12:54.550
I also do that with my men.

12:54.741 --> 12:57.119
The only thing about you
that doesn't surprise me

12:57.210 --> 12:59.087
is your capacity to surprise me.

12:59.245 --> 13:02.818
So good to see everybody.
I'm gonna check on the food.

13:04.584 --> 13:06.791
What's the delay? I have mammals in there
who need to eat food.

13:06.886 --> 13:08.388
Is this ready? What is it?

13:08.755 --> 13:10.132
- Potatoes.
- I can see that.

13:10.223 --> 13:12.066
- Potatoes a la what?
- Just potatoes.

13:12.125 --> 13:13.297
You can't really
eat them by themselves.

13:13.393 --> 13:16.135
I've eaten hummus with a pen cap.
Don't tell me how I can eat.

13:16.296 --> 13:19.800
AMY: So we can make a start with this.

13:19.899 --> 13:21.572
That is an ark of potato.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.238
- (ALL CHUCKLING)
- S.S. Starch.

13:23.336 --> 13:27.443
So, Amy, when are you going to ask us
to support you as campaign manager?

13:27.573 --> 13:29.746
I guess I don't have to now. Um...

13:29.942 --> 13:32.320
But anyone who talks
about work tonight has to take a drink.

13:32.412 --> 13:34.358
- Work.
- Oh, Ben jumped on that.

13:34.447 --> 13:35.619
- AMY: We're off. (CHUCKLES)
- (CELL PHONE BEEPING)

13:35.948 --> 13:39.191
- Where's your bathroom?
- It's second on the left.

13:39.919 --> 13:42.661
MIKE: Thank you. Thank you so much.
(CLEARS THROAT)

13:43.323 --> 13:44.324
(EXHALES)

13:46.426 --> 13:48.201
You look gorgeous!

13:48.294 --> 13:50.035
Do you think that I'm ruthless...

13:50.129 --> 13:51.665
- No.
- ...enough?

13:51.798 --> 13:53.368
- Oh, enough?
- Yeah.

13:53.599 --> 13:57.103
I think you have just the right amount
of grit in your oyster.

13:57.270 --> 13:58.271
- Huh?
- "Hmm?

13:58.638 --> 14:02.609
No, I mean,
can I be a complete fucking bitch?

14:02.775 --> 14:04.846
Please don't talk about yourself that way.

14:04.944 --> 14:07.288
You know how sometimes you have a friend,

14:07.447 --> 14:09.449
but they weren't up to their job?

14:09.615 --> 14:11.026
My shoulder is fine, ma'am.

14:11.117 --> 14:12.528
No, no. I'm not talking about you.

14:12.618 --> 14:13.961
(CHUCKLES) Okay.

14:14.287 --> 14:15.891
Though it doesn't look
like your shoulders fine.

14:15.988 --> 14:17.865
(STAMMERING) It's almost perfect...

14:17.957 --> 14:21.996
If that became some
sort of permanent disability...

14:22.061 --> 14:23.631
Mike's masturbating at work.

14:23.996 --> 14:25.976
- What?
- I caught him doing it.

14:26.199 --> 14:28.577
- No.
- Him and Wendy are doing IVF.

14:28.668 --> 14:31.478
And I caught him coming
out of the bathroom stall with a bag.

14:32.238 --> 14:33.308
Ugh!

14:33.639 --> 14:35.880
Oh, my God! Give me my phone.

14:35.975 --> 14:38.012
- Why?
- 'Cause I've got to be in touch with Ben.

14:38.077 --> 14:41.081
I can't have Mike getting "what's-her-ass"

14:41.180 --> 14:42.488
all knocked up and pregnant,

14:42.548 --> 14:44.994
becoming some son of a dad
during my campaign.

14:45.151 --> 14:46.391
What is keeping Mike? Mike?

14:46.486 --> 14:48.591
- MIKE: I'm here. Sorry. Sorry.
- (CELL PHONE BEEPS)

14:49.155 --> 14:51.931
- KENT: Join the party, Mike.
- This food looks amazing.

14:52.024 --> 14:53.867
AMY: It should be. It cost enough.

14:54.327 --> 14:58.503
Hey, Mike,
this salad doesn't have any dressing.

14:59.532 --> 15:01.341
Did you bring any extra dressing?

15:01.501 --> 15:02.741
What are you talking about, Ben?

15:02.935 --> 15:05.677
I hear the next course
is gonna be pulled pork.

15:06.072 --> 15:09.110
Pork that has been pulled.

15:09.509 --> 15:11.511
So everybody knows that I was in there

15:11.611 --> 15:13.284
masturbating into a cup now?

15:13.713 --> 15:16.592
- No, I was the only one who knew, Mike.
- We all know now.

15:16.716 --> 15:21.062
I really hope that's IVF or something, Mike,
because otherwise...

15:21.120 --> 15:22.622
It is. It is.

15:22.722 --> 15:25.430
Wendy and I are trying to conceive a child.

15:25.525 --> 15:28.438
Good luck with that.
That can be a tough road.

15:28.528 --> 15:31.566
- MIKE: I know.
- I have a sister who was...

15:32.064 --> 15:33.941
Well, she didn't have the...

15:34.300 --> 15:36.576
It kind of all went wrong within the tubing...

15:36.636 --> 15:38.445
- Stop talking.
- Copy that.

15:38.538 --> 15:39.608
Talk about something else.

15:39.705 --> 15:40.979
AMY: Before we eat,

15:41.073 --> 15:45.453
may I just say how much I value all of you.

15:45.545 --> 15:48.424
Thank you for your skills
and for your friendship.

15:48.548 --> 15:50.550
KENT: Hear, hear.
BEN: To skills.

15:51.050 --> 15:52.723
- (GLASSES RING)
- And friendship.

16:06.933 --> 16:10.437
Um, what if we don't have anything
to talk about but work?

16:10.503 --> 16:12.312
Oh. Work.

16:12.405 --> 16:14.612
We have plenty of other stuff to say.

16:14.807 --> 16:19.586
Amy, did I hear you
talking about Maddox hiring Jonah,

16:19.645 --> 16:21.420
- or was that a horrible nightmare I had?
- Mmm-hmm.

16:21.581 --> 16:23.288
Why would Maddox hire someone like that?

16:23.416 --> 16:24.952
Because of his uncle.

16:25.017 --> 16:26.360
Why? Who's his uncle?

16:26.586 --> 16:29.465
- Jeff Kane.
- Jeff Kane, the New Hampshire guy?

16:29.522 --> 16:31.001
- Yeah.
- AMY: The Jeff Kane.

16:31.090 --> 16:33.127
Who controls the senior citizen vote
in New Hampshire?

16:33.192 --> 16:34.933
How do you think
he got the job in the White House?

16:34.994 --> 16:37.201
She's at Maddox's right now.
I have to call her.

16:37.296 --> 16:39.367
Maddox's camp will give you nothing.

16:39.465 --> 16:41.376
- Maddox has access to...
- Yeah, I know that.

16:41.467 --> 16:43.447
I know that, and that's why I'm gonna call.

16:43.503 --> 16:46.677
You know what's gonna help, everybody?
If you just go.

16:46.806 --> 16:49.446
I don't mean to be rude,
but dinner has got to be over.

16:49.942 --> 16:52.855
Please, all, do support Amy
as Selina's campaign manager.

16:52.945 --> 16:54.686
Please do. Yay me. Yay me.

16:54.780 --> 16:56.054
BEN: Anybody wanna get a burger?
MIKE: Yeah.

16:56.148 --> 16:57.991
- Don't forget your bag, Mike.
- MIKE: Thanks, Kent.

16:58.117 --> 17:00.791
It seems more appropriate
now that it's just the two of us.

17:00.887 --> 17:03.993
- No. You have to go too.
- Amy, it's our anniversary.

17:04.223 --> 17:07.829
Oh, please do not tell me
you are one of those fucking weirdoes

17:07.894 --> 17:09.896
that celebrates three month-a-versaries.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.473
It's actually a year.

17:11.531 --> 17:15.205
A year in which you neglected
to tell me about Jeff Kane. Go.

17:15.300 --> 17:17.906
I guess I'll go tell the violinist
that he has the night off.

17:18.137 --> 17:20.708
I'll have him play me
a bunch of Smiths covers in my car.

17:20.806 --> 17:23.844
- Ma'am... You gotta go.
- SELINA: <i>Hey, what's up?</i>

17:24.175 --> 17:25.176
Jeff Kane.

17:25.645 --> 17:27.214
The New Hampshire guy.
Yeah. What about him?

17:27.313 --> 17:30.260
<i>- He's Jonah's uncle.</i>
- Shit.

17:30.349 --> 17:33.922
- DAN: What?
- Jeff Kane is Jonah's uncle?

17:34.020 --> 17:36.057
- What?
- No!

17:36.155 --> 17:38.999
Tell Dan he needs to find Jonah now
and peach him.

17:39.158 --> 17:40.762
Okay. We're all over this.

17:40.893 --> 17:43.703
That's obviously
how he got the job with Maddox.

17:43.829 --> 17:45.240
No one would be so stupid
to hire him otherwise.

17:45.331 --> 17:46.935
- Exactly.
- (STAMMERS)

17:47.033 --> 17:48.569
- So, we're all set?
- SELINA: Yeah.

17:49.101 --> 17:51.741
Yeah. Oh, Sir, where is Jonah?

17:52.271 --> 17:54.683
- Who?
- The tall fellow.

17:54.740 --> 17:57.744
The bag of bones guy?
He's in your entourage.

17:57.877 --> 17:59.720
Haven't we got
more important things to talk about?

17:59.845 --> 18:01.722
- We do, George. We certainly do.
- (GEORGE CHUCKLES)

18:01.781 --> 18:03.852
- Right this way.
- Thank you so much. Thank you.

18:06.686 --> 18:09.064
Hey, buddy. How's it going?

18:09.422 --> 18:11.060
Why the fuck do you care?

18:11.123 --> 18:12.932
- Why shouldn't I care?
- Because you hate me.

18:13.025 --> 18:15.767
All right, look. There's a fine line, Jonah,

18:15.861 --> 18:18.535
between hate and non-hate.

18:18.764 --> 18:20.266
You attacked me with a burrito.

18:20.366 --> 18:22.437
And if I could turn back
the hands of time, I would.

18:22.535 --> 18:24.913
- What, so you could do it again?
- No.

18:25.204 --> 18:27.741
The juice could have gotten in my eyes, Dan.

18:27.807 --> 18:29.616
The spicy burrito juice.

18:29.709 --> 18:31.916
I think you and I
have a lot in common, actually.

18:32.044 --> 18:34.786
- We do?
- Yeah. We say it like it is.

18:35.047 --> 18:37.823
So if I did want to run,
why would I just step aside for you?

18:37.917 --> 18:39.760
(CHUCKLES) See, that's what
I'm talking about.

18:39.919 --> 18:42.422
- Why wouldn't you?
- No, why would I?

18:42.622 --> 18:46.434
Well, I believe that I've earned this, George.

18:46.592 --> 18:49.971
I also believe
that the position of vice president

18:50.062 --> 18:51.837
can be a very rewarding one.

18:52.064 --> 18:53.441
Even though it has no power?

18:53.566 --> 18:55.307
It has some constitutional power,

18:55.401 --> 18:59.247
and, by the way,
I think that I can pull some pretty big levers.

18:59.505 --> 19:02.611
You exercise this power very discreetly,
I must say.

19:04.577 --> 19:05.988
Maddox? Come on, man.

19:06.078 --> 19:07.853
That guy's got ulterior motives,
and you know it.

19:07.947 --> 19:09.324
What do you mean, ulterior motives?

19:09.582 --> 19:11.584
I just think he's keeping you around...

19:11.751 --> 19:14.129
- Because?
- Because of your uncle, Jeff Kane.

19:14.186 --> 19:16.530
- Fuck you, Dan.
- I just offered you a job.

19:16.622 --> 19:19.000
People like me' people hire me,
people date me,

19:19.091 --> 19:22.163
and people fuck me
because I'm triple-A fuckin' awesome

19:22.261 --> 19:23.831
- and no other reason.
- Sure.

19:23.996 --> 19:27.000
So why don't you scooch your little
butt out of my fuckin' pantry?

19:27.099 --> 19:30.137
You know what? The only reason
you have a fuckin' job, Jonah,

19:30.202 --> 19:32.182
is because your uncle is Donald Chump.

19:32.304 --> 19:34.511
Wake up and smell the fuckin' burrito juice.

19:34.674 --> 19:36.654
You know what? Selina's gonna lose

19:36.709 --> 19:39.451
and President Maddox
is gonna have you both executed!

19:39.545 --> 19:41.616
That's not even the way it works,
you fuckin' idiot.

19:41.681 --> 19:43.957
Yeah? Well, maybe you're a fuckin' idiot.

19:44.283 --> 19:46.854
So I think we both agree that the
strongest candidate should run.

19:46.986 --> 19:48.124
Absolutely.

19:48.187 --> 19:50.189
And we both agree
that the role of vice president

19:50.289 --> 19:52.291
can be a very significant one.

19:52.391 --> 19:54.234
You've certainly made a compelling argument.

19:54.326 --> 19:56.203
- You'd consider that?
- Absolutely.

19:56.462 --> 19:58.908
- You'd be my vice president.
- Would love for you to be my vice president.

19:58.998 --> 20:00.477
Huh? What did you just say?

20:00.566 --> 20:03.877
It makes sense for me. You're already vetted.

20:04.136 --> 20:05.171
Are you kidding me?

20:05.237 --> 20:07.478
Plus you would be the first vice president

20:07.573 --> 20:10.053
to serve under two successive presidents.

20:10.142 --> 20:13.146
I'd rather be shot in the fucking face

20:13.312 --> 20:15.417
than serve as vice president again.

20:16.348 --> 20:18.055
Seriously, in the fucking face!

20:18.150 --> 20:19.151
(SELINA SCOFFS)

20:20.820 --> 20:22.322
(SOFTLY) Hey, how'd it go?

20:22.655 --> 20:23.656
Uh-uh.

20:23.723 --> 20:25.031
(SIGHS) Oh, God.

20:25.091 --> 20:26.570
- How'd it go?
- (GRUMBLING)

20:26.659 --> 20:28.036
Oh.

20:29.662 --> 20:32.199
DAN: <i>All right, guys, listen.
Maddox is running, okay?</i>

20:32.264 --> 20:34.870
So I need you to access
the strategy file in Dropbox.

20:34.934 --> 20:37.210
Password, "mother_fucker."

20:37.269 --> 20:38.441
So our next move

20:38.537 --> 20:40.107
- is to stop Chung from running.
- No.

20:40.239 --> 20:43.083
Two ex-military candidates
are gonna squeeze you out, ma'am.

20:43.209 --> 20:44.745
The subtext of every question will be,

20:44.844 --> 20:46.289
"Yeah, you're pretty,
but can you break a man's neck?"

20:46.378 --> 20:47.379
Let me explain something to you.

20:47.446 --> 20:52.361
You had me go marching off to the country
to try and keep Maddox from running,

20:52.451 --> 20:54.397
and then today,
he announced he's running, right?

20:54.453 --> 20:57.434
Oh, what's in your lunchbox, Mike?

20:57.523 --> 21:00.470
A protein shake? You degenerate.

21:00.693 --> 21:03.640
You know about this?
The private thing I wanted kept private?

21:03.863 --> 21:06.400
You know, Mike, it would please me greatly

21:06.699 --> 21:08.701
if you would do me the honor

21:08.768 --> 21:11.112
of removing your jizzbox

21:11.203 --> 21:13.774
from our executive branch of government.

21:14.039 --> 21:16.110
- It's actually a cooler.
- Oh! Then, by all means.

21:16.208 --> 21:18.950
Open it up, let's have a picnic.
I'll boil up my eggs.

21:21.313 --> 21:24.886
So, listen. I'm gonna get rid of the team,
the whole bunch.

21:25.251 --> 21:28.255
Desperate Dan, flailing Amy,
crippled Gary, jizzy Mike.

21:28.320 --> 21:29.799
Jizzy Mike?

21:29.889 --> 21:32.130
Yeah. He jerks off all the time in the office.

21:32.224 --> 21:33.669
Really? He does that?

21:33.759 --> 21:36.399
Yeah, he really does. You have no idea.

21:36.462 --> 21:38.271
Anyway, I'm going to get rid of 'em.

21:38.330 --> 21:40.276
I'm gonna shoot Mike and Gary in the head,

21:40.332 --> 21:41.970
I'll poison Amy, I'll behead Dan.

21:42.067 --> 21:45.344
- Ma'am.
- Oh, shit. What are you doing here?

21:45.671 --> 21:48.015
(STAMMERS) Look, I'm so sorry to interrupt,

21:48.107 --> 21:51.145
but I have some inside Maddox polling data.

21:51.277 --> 21:54.258
- How did you find me?
- I put a lot of pressure on Sue.

21:55.481 --> 21:57.984
So, she's gonna have to go too.

21:58.083 --> 21:59.824
Wait. What do you mean, too?

21:59.919 --> 22:02.160
Yeah, Dan, listen...

22:02.488 --> 22:05.526
Bill is going to be
our new campaign manager...

22:05.624 --> 22:07.035
I'm flattered, but the answer's no.

22:07.526 --> 22:08.527
I'm sorry. What?

22:08.627 --> 22:10.937
I hate to say I got a better offer,
but I got a better offer.

22:10.996 --> 22:12.373
Is it Danny Chung?

22:12.464 --> 22:16.640
That desperate dick covered in medals
that he got on eBay, by the way?

22:16.802 --> 22:18.941
- Not Chung. It's Thornhill.
- SELINA: What?

22:19.004 --> 22:23.043
Baseball Joe?
That man's a vegetable. Seriously.

22:23.142 --> 22:24.780
- So he can catch a ball.
- He can win.

22:24.877 --> 22:27.016
He did it on the field
when nobody thought he had a chance.

22:27.112 --> 22:28.853
People love his story, they love his attitude.

22:28.948 --> 22:30.325
I don't love your attitude.

22:30.382 --> 22:32.521
- So why don't you go and...
- With all due respect...

22:32.618 --> 22:36.998
You know what? You stop interrupting me,
you stupid fucking interrupty guy.

22:37.056 --> 22:39.969
- I'm sorry.
- I am un-offering you the job.

22:40.025 --> 22:43.666
You will never be
my campaign manager, ever!

22:43.729 --> 22:46.300
- Well, it was a pleasure to meet you, ma'am.
- You bet it was.

22:46.398 --> 22:48.378
It was a huge pleasure to meet me.

22:48.500 --> 22:50.309
You know we're going to rip you apart.

22:50.569 --> 22:52.242
On, so scary!

22:54.173 --> 22:56.175
(SIREN BLARING)

23:02.815 --> 23:04.385
Dan...

23:05.484 --> 23:07.657
Do you want to be my campaign manager?

23:11.323 --> 23:13.269
- Yes.
- Yeah.

23:13.592 --> 23:15.572
- Yes, I do.
- Okay.

23:16.328 --> 23:17.773
Yeah!

23:18.397 --> 23:19.933
Ma'am. you...

23:20.032 --> 23:22.410
I am not going to let you down.
You will not regret this.

23:22.501 --> 23:23.571
- Okay.
- Yeah.

23:23.669 --> 23:25.114
- Okay.
- Yeah !

23:27.940 --> 23:29.419
GARY: <i>This is amazing;.</i>

23:29.508 --> 23:31.385
I feel all floaty. What's this one called?

23:31.443 --> 23:33.423
- It's a boilermaker.
- A boilermaker!

23:33.512 --> 23:34.513
(LAUGHING)

23:34.680 --> 23:36.751
- You never had one?
- Mmm-mmm.

23:36.849 --> 23:37.919
I'm a Prosecco man.

23:38.017 --> 23:39.428
I wouldn't spread that around, Gary.

23:39.518 --> 23:40.622
Did you know I got a condition?

23:40.719 --> 23:41.857
What, you can't hold your alcohol?

23:41.921 --> 23:43.628
No, it's my shoulder. I'm in a lot of pain.

23:43.722 --> 23:44.860
Join the club, pal.

23:44.924 --> 23:49.100
No, but I carry around Selina's big, heavy bag
of her tampon bullshit.

23:49.461 --> 23:50.804
- And the doctor...
- (BOTH LAUGHING)

23:50.896 --> 23:52.273
- I'm serious.
- Mike.

23:52.364 --> 23:55.470
- The doctor told me to get another job.
- No.

23:55.567 --> 23:57.808
- You need to get another doctor.
- Thank you.

23:57.903 --> 23:59.712
Yeah. Did he give you a cortisone shot?

23:59.805 --> 24:01.876
- No! No!
- See?

24:01.941 --> 24:03.648
Mr. Bartender!

24:03.776 --> 24:05.119
A cortisone shot!

24:05.210 --> 24:06.621

24:06.946 --> 24:08.289
Tequila.

24:08.380 --> 24:10.417
Tequila! Oh.

24:10.549 --> 24:13.325
Mike, is the bar the appropriate place

24:13.419 --> 24:14.989
for the contents of that bag?

24:15.087 --> 24:17.294
Relax, Amy. It's a spoiled batch.

24:17.389 --> 24:20.302
I missed my window today at the clinic
and Wendy is not happy.

- Hey, Mr. Kent!
- Hey, kids. Everybody well oiled?

because there may be some changes.

24:33.072 --> 24:34.745
Please tell me that it's not Dan.

24:34.807 --> 24:35.842
It's not Dan.

24:44.750 --> 24:48.960
He said that you'd be better off
as a croupier fucking older women.

That doesn't bother me. I...

I like older women.

24:53.859 --> 24:55.634
I do. They have life experience.

- Not just the sexy stuff.

- Well, they've got that too, I can tell you that.
- Mmm-hmm.

since I've been with an older woman.

- Yeah.

25:32.231 --> 25:34.643
Do you have any skeletons?

- Yeah.
- Okay. Here we go.

- Yeah, I've got one. When I was a kid...
- Yeah?

A bunch of older kids dared me...

25:44.376 --> 25:47.823
- (CHUCKLES)
- ...to kill this stray dog. And I did.

- Really?
- Yeah.

- You killed a dog?
- Yeah.

25:55.754 --> 25:57.427
Shit.

Okay, now, your turn. You go.

- Just let fly.
- Okay. Well...

- Right before Andrew and I split up...
- Mmm-hmm.

I don't know if you remember,
but his car caught fire.

26:11.603 --> 26:12.946
Yeah.

some shake-ups.

- Oh. Sorry, Amy.

- Fuck, Dan?

26:39.631 --> 26:40.632
Oh.

26:40.899 --> 26:42.242
She was talking to Ericsson.

26:42.301 --> 26:44.542
I invited you guys to dinner.

26:44.603 --> 26:45.877
Yeah, then you kicked us out.

26:52.711 --> 26:53.712
(ALL CHEER)

26:53.779 --> 26:54.780
Careful.

26:55.047 --> 26:56.424
Why would she go with Dan

26:56.482 --> 26:58.621
when he couldn't even
poach Jonah from Maddox?

26:58.717 --> 27:00.458
AMY: The one thing
that will push me over the edge right now

27:00.552 --> 27:02.327
is if you mention Jonah's name.

27:02.421 --> 27:04.992
He could actually stumble in here.
He lives right around the corner.

27:05.090 --> 27:07.070
- He won't come in here.
- Mike, I got an idea.

27:07.126 --> 27:09.572
We should throw
your expired cum at Jonah's door.

27:09.628 --> 27:10.629
(LAUGHING)

27:10.729 --> 27:12.072
- You're kidding.
- I'm not kidding.

27:12.131 --> 27:14.509
- Let's throw his cum at Jonah's door.
- (LAUGHING)

27:14.800 --> 27:16.245
Yeah!

27:16.401 --> 27:20.178
Let's throw cum! Let's throw cum!

27:20.272 --> 27:23.082
Amy, no, no... That's my DNA!

27:24.843 --> 27:27.187
- I would like to see that, but we'll stay.
- Yeah.

27:27.312 --> 27:29.087
All right, I'm out of here.

27:29.915 --> 27:30.916
(DAN SIGHS)

27:31.316 --> 27:32.989
How did you kill it?

27:33.585 --> 27:36.429
- Sorry, what?
- Nothing. It's fine.

27:36.488 --> 27:39.094
- We're good? All right.
- Yeah.

27:39.424 --> 27:40.425
(DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES)

27:42.427 --> 27:45.499
I had a romantic dinner
of champagne and oysters,

27:45.597 --> 27:48.271
and Wendy finished me off in a cup.
It was beautiful.

27:48.834 --> 27:51.781
- Sounds pretty good, except for the oysters.
- MIKE: Yeah. I like 'em.

27:52.104 --> 27:54.778
- We do this like a contract killing, all right?
- AMY: Where is it?

27:54.840 --> 27:55.841
- (KNOCKING ON DOOR)
- AMY: Mike!

27:55.941 --> 27:56.976
BEN: What the fuck are you doing?

27:57.109 --> 27:59.555
- Hurry up. Just get it out.
- (SHUSHING)

28:00.612 --> 28:01.716
Hey, guys.

28:04.300 --> 28:14.300
