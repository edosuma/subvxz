about fairness.

There's nothing fair

about a werewolf

18:03.900 --> 18:06.970

Either you release
the pressure with a

or...

18:13.110 --> 18:18.580

We need to release
the pressure, Sheriff.

18:22.750 --> 18:25.550

18:25.590 --> 18:27.120
you mean murder two children,

hunting them instead.

27:06.310 --> 27:08.140
How?

use public records to find
where someone lives.

It doesn't matter, Scott.

Because if you find yourself

A creature of disharmony.

It can turn neighbor
against neighbor,

the Anuk-ite.

that means that
