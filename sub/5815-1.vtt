03:46.713 --> 03:48.012
I'm sorry.

03:48.014 --> 03:50.094
- Oh, it's okay.
- I'm sorry, baby.

03:51.015 --> 03:53.716
- I'm sorry.
- Fucking shoulder.

03:54.818 --> 03:56.351
Keep going.

03:57.353 --> 03:58.820
That's helping.

04:04.793 --> 04:06.059
Never.

04:06.061 --> 04:07.994
Just a little bit.
Just to clean it up.

04:07.996 --> 04:09.195
I'm not cutting it.

04:09.197 --> 04:11.297
But you'd look so hot
with short hair.

04:11.299 --> 04:13.432
- Oh, would I?
- Yeah.

04:13.434 --> 04:14.866
- Thank you.
- No, no, no...

04:14.868 --> 04:17.000
Sorry, I didn't mean it
like that.

04:17.003 --> 04:18.935
You are hot.

04:18.938 --> 04:22.005
You are the hottest.

04:22.007 --> 04:24.907
- Keep going.
- You and your gorgeous,

04:24.909 --> 04:27.342
thick, long hair.

04:27.344 --> 04:29.711
- Continue...
- I just fucking love the way it's long.

04:29.713 --> 04:30.812
Yeah?

04:30.814 --> 04:34.115
Happy Father's Day, Daddy!

04:34.117 --> 04:36.283
Kids, we said after breakfast.

04:36.285 --> 04:38.218
I want cake for breakfast.

04:38.220 --> 04:42.021
Wow! Chocolate with sprinkles!

04:42.023 --> 04:43.122
My favorite.

04:43.124 --> 04:45.057
Happy Father's Day!

04:45.059 --> 04:46.725
- Open it! Open it! Open it!
- Open it! Open it! Open it!

04:46.727 --> 04:48.860
I am, I am.

04:48.862 --> 04:51.062
I like building up
the anticipation.

04:53.731 --> 04:56.165
Oh, you guys...

04:56.167 --> 04:58.100
- You like it?
- I love it.

04:58.102 --> 05:00.268
Muah! I love it.

05:00.270 --> 05:02.203
- Thank you.
- Mom helped us.

05:02.205 --> 05:05.306
No, I didn't.
It was all their idea.

05:05.308 --> 05:08.175
- Right, kids?
- Right.

05:08.177 --> 05:10.210
- Cake! Cake! Cake!
- Cake! Cake! Cake!

05:10.212 --> 05:12.212
- Okay, okay.
- Cake! Cake! Cake!

05:12.214 --> 05:14.280
Cake! Cake! Cake! Cake!

05:14.282 --> 05:17.383
Oh, look at that
beautiful looking cake!

05:17.385 --> 05:19.785
Ah...

05:19.787 --> 05:23.421
Who did this to monster!

05:26.425 --> 05:30.160
Oh, you can't hide from monster!

05:30.162 --> 05:32.428
Monster can smell you!

05:32.430 --> 05:34.062
Run! Run!
Monster's coming!

05:40.502 --> 05:42.335
Argh!

05:45.405 --> 05:48.273
Monster made kids disappear.

05:48.275 --> 05:49.874
And...

05:49.876 --> 05:53.210
Monster wanna finish
what we started.

05:53.212 --> 05:55.879
Too late, the kids are awake.

05:55.881 --> 05:57.480
Monster sad.

05:57.482 --> 06:00.182
I'm sure monster can
wait till Monday.

06:00.184 --> 06:02.484
Monster been waiting
three weeks.

06:02.486 --> 06:04.486
Yeah, but with the kids
and my exhibition

06:04.488 --> 06:06.855
I cannot keep everybody
happy all the time.

06:06.857 --> 06:08.890
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

06:08.892 --> 06:11.259
Monster doesn't want
to start a fight.

06:11.261 --> 06:13.227
Okay. Sorry, me neither.

06:15.063 --> 06:18.231
I promise we'll finish this
as soon as I get back.

06:21.201 --> 06:24.937
Oh, monster happy.

06:24.939 --> 06:27.105
Monster happy.

06:27.107 --> 06:28.973
Monster very happy.

06:33.846 --> 06:36.279
Yeah, Mommy.

06:36.281 --> 06:37.980
<i>- Gracias.
- De nada.</i>

06:37.982 --> 06:40.215
- Everybody packed?
- Yeah.

06:40.217 --> 06:42.283
Monkey, good boy.

06:42.285 --> 06:45.085
Dad, why can't we take
Monkey to the beach with us?

06:45.087 --> 06:46.886
Yeah, you know
he loves the beach.

06:46.888 --> 06:48.988
Monkey needs to stay here
and keep your dad company

06:48.990 --> 06:51.790
so he doesn't stay
all alone during the weekend.

06:51.792 --> 06:53.992
- That's unfair.
- Knock-knock.

06:53.994 --> 06:55.193
Hey, Louis!

06:55.195 --> 06:57.035
Hey, guys,
hot off the presses.

06:58.497 --> 07:00.063
- What's going on, Louis?
- What's shakin'?

07:00.065 --> 07:01.564
What's going on, little guys?

07:01.566 --> 07:02.998
Mr. Webber, how are you, sir?

07:03.000 --> 07:04.966
Morning, Louis.

07:04.968 --> 07:07.535
I'd offer you a hand, but all
I can lift is this coffee.

07:07.537 --> 07:11.939
Oh, that's what happens when
you try to impress girls in the bat cage.

07:11.941 --> 07:14.541
I wasn't flirting,
I was being a gentleman.

07:14.543 --> 07:17.810
Yeah, I'm sure she was
a poor helpless 25-year-old.

07:17.812 --> 07:18.977
Yeah, helpless.

07:20.447 --> 07:22.013
Do you know what this is?

07:22.015 --> 07:24.548
Is it a Father's Day
present for Daddy?

07:24.550 --> 07:26.550
No. No, this is
Mommy's catalog.

07:26.552 --> 07:28.952
Assuming they got the color
right this time.

07:28.954 --> 07:30.286
Oh, let's hope.

07:31.321 --> 07:33.322
I think they did.

07:35.292 --> 07:38.559
It's a little bit magenta,
but it's almost perfect.

07:38.561 --> 07:39.993
- What's magenta?
- This color.

07:39.995 --> 07:42.228
Honey, it's perfect.

07:42.230 --> 07:44.330
Mom, can Louis come
to the beach with us?

07:44.332 --> 07:46.332
Yeah.

07:46.334 --> 07:49.168
No, Louis needs to stay here
and do some work.

07:49.170 --> 07:50.169
Just like your daddy.

07:50.171 --> 07:52.371
That's correct.

07:52.373 --> 07:56.174
Father's Day party that me and
your dad are gonna have tonight.

07:56.176 --> 07:58.042
Louis! Shh!

07:58.044 --> 08:00.611
- Oh, come on.
- You're not having a party.

08:00.613 --> 08:02.112
I'm not having a party,

08:02.114 --> 08:03.513
I'm working very hard.

08:03.515 --> 08:05.381
Did you pack your gun?

08:05.383 --> 08:07.449
- Yes.
- Did you pack the bomb?

08:07.451 --> 08:09.050
- Yes.
- Have you packed the cannon?

08:09.052 --> 08:11.218
- Yes.
- Have you packed the chainsaw?

08:11.220 --> 08:13.887
You didn't pack the chainsaw?

08:13.889 --> 08:16.389
Go get the chainsaw, man!

08:19.126 --> 08:21.994
The cement still hasn't dried,
but it should be fine by tomorrow night.

08:21.996 --> 08:26.164
Still, it's extremely fragile
and I don't trust those movers

08:26.166 --> 08:27.365
after the mess
they made at the gallery.

08:27.367 --> 08:29.300
Mmm-mmm. No, I'll take
care of it. Don't worry.

08:29.302 --> 08:31.902
Okay, <i>gracias,</i> I'll have it
all packed up for you.

08:31.904 --> 08:33.270
Okay.

08:33.272 --> 08:36.472
It's almost dry though.

08:36.475 --> 08:38.441
Yeah, so I'll just text you
when it's at the gallery.

08:38.443 --> 08:40.543
Don't worry about anything,

08:40.544 --> 08:43.178
I got it all under control.
You have a good weekend at the beach.

08:43.179 --> 08:45.146
Enjoy yourself. I'm out.

08:45.148 --> 08:47.214
<i>Gracias,</i> Louis.

08:47.216 --> 08:49.349
- Mr. Webber, I'll see you tomorrow.
- Thank you.

08:49.351 --> 08:51.451
I mean, "tonight"
for the super-secret party.

08:51.453 --> 08:53.386
- Louis...
- See you, kids.

08:53.388 --> 08:55.554
- Bye, Louis.
- Super-secret party?

08:55.556 --> 08:57.923
- Super-secret party.
- Okay.

08:57.925 --> 08:59.357
Is this the last one?

08:59.359 --> 09:00.925
- You like it?
- I love it.

09:00.927 --> 09:01.992
Good.

09:01.994 --> 09:04.160
I think it should be bigger.

09:04.162 --> 09:07.096
- You think so?
- Yeah, then we can get the pool.

09:07.098 --> 09:09.364
Okay, I'll do it
bigger next time.

09:10.566 --> 09:13.668
I told Vivian tomorrow
at 2:00.

09:13.670 --> 09:16.237
I don't need her therapy
anymore, it's healing.

09:16.239 --> 09:18.172
Tell that to your shoulder.

09:18.174 --> 09:20.607
Dad, are you sure
you can't come to the beach with us?

09:20.609 --> 09:23.142
I would love
nothing more, sport.

09:23.144 --> 09:25.544
But if Daddy doesn't work
this weekend, we'll have to live in a box.

09:25.546 --> 09:27.245
Do you guys
want to live in a box?

09:27.247 --> 09:28.512
- No.
- No. Not really.

09:28.514 --> 09:30.580
Me neither.
Unless I designed it.

09:30.582 --> 09:32.214
Okay, say goodbye to Daddy.

09:32.216 --> 09:33.381
Bye, Daddy.

09:33.383 --> 09:35.383
Say goodbye to Monkey.

09:35.385 --> 09:37.385
Bye, Monkey.

09:37.387 --> 09:40.121
Daddy, don't forget to send
all your party pix on Instagram.

09:40.123 --> 09:41.489
Okay.

09:41.491 --> 09:43.057
Call me when you get there.

09:43.059 --> 09:44.658
I will. I love you.

09:44.660 --> 09:46.580
- I love you.
- I love you.

09:47.227 --> 09:48.360
Bye, guys.

09:48.362 --> 09:49.461
- Bye.
- Bye, Daddy.

09:49.463 --> 09:50.929
Get a haircut, Dad!

10:02.340 --> 10:03.973
Well, Monkey...

10:03.975 --> 10:05.735
Looks like it's just me
and you, kid.

11:28.588 --> 11:29.653
Hey, baby.

11:30.621 --> 11:31.687
How's the house?

11:31.689 --> 11:33.755
<i>Hi! It's perfect.</i>

11:33.757 --> 11:36.657
<i>Look. Kids, say hello
to your dad.</i>

11:36.659 --> 11:38.425
<i>- Hi!</i>
- Hello.

11:38.427 --> 11:40.260
<i>All it needs is you.</i>

11:49.302 --> 11:51.503
<i>- I love you.</i>
- I love you, too.

11:51.505 --> 11:52.570
Miss you.

11:53.538 --> 11:54.738
Good night.

13:27.758 --> 13:29.225
Who's there?

13:32.562 --> 13:35.797
Just one second, sir, please.

13:35.799 --> 13:38.519
- Hello?
- Could I use your phone, please?

13:40.634 --> 13:42.001
Yes?

13:42.003 --> 13:43.602
We're so sorry
to bother you, sir,

13:43.604 --> 13:46.605
but could you please tell us
where the Gregorys live?

13:46.607 --> 13:48.340
This is the third house
we've tried.

13:48.342 --> 13:50.702
Looks like everyone's gone
for the long weekend.

13:52.310 --> 13:53.677
The Gregorys?

13:55.646 --> 13:57.747
No, I don't know anyone
around here

13:57.749 --> 13:58.814
by that name.

13:59.882 --> 14:02.250
What's the address?

14:02.252 --> 14:03.684
Um,

14:03.686 --> 14:05.752
I honestly don't know.

14:05.754 --> 14:07.987
My phone got wet
and she left hers at her house.

14:07.989 --> 14:09.722
The taxi just dropped us here.

14:09.724 --> 14:11.757
We've been walking around
for, like, 20 minutes.

14:11.759 --> 14:13.925
Yeah, my feet are, like, dying.

14:16.995 --> 14:19.796
Well, I'm sorry.
I'm afraid I can't help you.

14:25.368 --> 14:26.601
Bless you.

14:31.806 --> 14:32.806
Here.

14:33.907 --> 14:35.274
Thank you.

14:40.413 --> 14:42.781
Well, if you guys want
you can come in and use my phone.

14:42.783 --> 14:45.750
Oh, thanks, but...

14:45.752 --> 14:48.018
All our contacts are on
our phones.

14:48.020 --> 14:50.953
I... I don't even know my own number,
can you believe it?

14:53.323 --> 14:54.890
Maybe Ashley's on Facebook chat?

14:54.892 --> 14:57.525
Ah, genius.

14:57.527 --> 15:00.528
Actually, would you mind
if we just used your computer for a sec?

15:01.763 --> 15:03.730
We don't want to impose.

15:03.732 --> 15:06.298
We'll just get the address
and be out of your hair.

15:08.734 --> 15:10.935
Yeah. Sure.

15:10.937 --> 15:11.937
Come in.

15:13.070 --> 15:14.070
Thank you.

15:24.547 --> 15:26.780
No, it's fine. Don't worry.

15:26.782 --> 15:27.947
Oh, I don't mind.

15:27.949 --> 15:29.682
We don't want to mess up
your house.

15:29.684 --> 15:31.850
Yeah. Excuse me.

15:37.756 --> 15:39.923
Um, thank you so, so much.

15:39.925 --> 15:43.059
- I know this is so random.
- It's fine.

15:43.061 --> 15:46.529
Hang on, I'll get you
an iPad and some towels.

15:46.531 --> 15:47.763
Thanks.

15:50.366 --> 15:51.566
Nice house.

15:53.101 --> 15:54.568
Thanks.

16:15.056 --> 16:16.589
Girls?

16:16.591 --> 16:17.790
We're in here.

16:21.728 --> 16:23.662
I'm so sorry,
it was warmer here.

16:23.664 --> 16:25.363
Hope you don't mind.

16:25.365 --> 16:26.831
We were freezing.

16:27.465 --> 16:28.531
Here.

16:28.533 --> 16:30.633
Oh, my God. Thank you.

16:30.635 --> 16:33.535
This is beyond embarrassing.

16:33.537 --> 16:34.669
Don't worry about it.

16:34.671 --> 16:36.704
Make yourselves at home.

16:46.814 --> 16:48.614
I'm Bel, by the way.

16:49.716 --> 16:51.450
Evan.

16:51.452 --> 16:53.692
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

16:54.086 --> 16:55.619
Ashley's online.

16:56.087 --> 16:57.087
Cool.

17:00.524 --> 17:02.925
You're a life saver, Evan.

17:02.927 --> 17:07.496
Not everyone would just let two total
strangers into their house these days.

17:07.498 --> 17:09.865
Well, you don't look
that dangerous.

17:10.766 --> 17:13.099
Worst case scenario,

17:13.102 --> 17:14.902
I know I can
take the both of you.

17:15.602 --> 17:17.135
I'm not so sure.

17:17.137 --> 17:18.736
I do air boxing.

17:18.738 --> 17:21.171
- Air boxing?
- Yeah, like, you know?

17:21.173 --> 17:23.940
- Oh, okay.
- Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

17:24.907 --> 17:26.642
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes.

17:26.644 --> 17:28.764
- What's the address?
- His name's Evan.

17:29.045 --> 17:30.045
Evan?

17:30.812 --> 17:32.045
458 Canter.

17:34.515 --> 17:37.783
Wow. We're like, far.

17:37.785 --> 17:40.152
It was Kantner, not Canter.

17:40.154 --> 17:43.421
The cab must've
misunderstood us.

17:43.423 --> 17:46.457
I told you that he was
going the wrong way.

17:46.459 --> 17:49.426
That guy barely spoke English.

17:49.428 --> 17:51.895
I mean, his English
was worse than mine.

17:52.997 --> 17:54.697
This is so retarded.

17:54.699 --> 17:57.199
Don't worry about it.
I'll call an Uber.

17:57.201 --> 17:59.434
No. No, no, no.

17:59.436 --> 18:01.836
We can find a cab outside.
It's no problem.

18:01.838 --> 18:04.972
Not around here, you won't.

18:04.974 --> 18:07.641
Trust me,
it's the only reliable way.

18:07.643 --> 18:10.143
You sure?
I feel like such an idiot.

18:10.145 --> 18:11.811
We don't want to ruin
your night.

18:11.813 --> 18:13.012
No really. It's fine.

18:15.081 --> 18:16.815
It's looking for a driver.

18:17.817 --> 18:20.518
And it'll be here in...

18:22.854 --> 18:24.621
45 minutes.

18:25.956 --> 18:27.156
That long?

18:27.957 --> 18:29.223
The rain.

18:29.225 --> 18:30.690
We're lucky we even got one.

18:41.500 --> 18:42.700
What?

18:44.003 --> 18:46.670
Um, I know this is gonna
sound weird,

18:46.672 --> 18:50.874
but could we maybe throw our clothes in
your dryer just for, like, 10 minutes?

18:50.876 --> 18:52.675
We really don't want to go
to a party soaking wet.

18:52.677 --> 18:53.742
No.

18:55.010 --> 18:56.075
Please?

18:59.746 --> 19:02.948
Sure, sure. Um...

19:02.950 --> 19:05.684
We have some extra robes.
I'll, uh, go get them.

19:05.686 --> 19:07.619
- Thank you.
- Yay.

19:07.621 --> 19:09.854
This is literally
saving our lives.

19:09.856 --> 19:11.822
Yeah, we could get sick and die.

19:15.893 --> 19:17.013
You have your phone?

19:17.727 --> 19:18.993
Uh yeah, why?

19:20.829 --> 19:21.909
I can try and fix it.

19:22.696 --> 19:23.996
Really? Oh.

19:24.998 --> 19:27.699
My kid dropped mine in the tub,

19:27.701 --> 19:29.734
and you won't believe this,
but if you put it in rice

19:29.736 --> 19:30.968
it kinda dries it out.

19:32.003 --> 19:34.704
- That would be awesome.
- Rice?

19:34.706 --> 19:37.807
Oh, my God,
you're like a MythBuster.

19:37.809 --> 19:40.008
Thank you so much, Evan.

19:42.945 --> 19:45.046
You're welcome...

19:45.048 --> 19:46.981
- Genesis.
- Genesis.

19:46.983 --> 19:49.249
Yeah, like
the beginning of time.

19:50.918 --> 19:51.998
In the beginning.

19:53.219 --> 19:54.986
Sorry.

19:54.988 --> 19:58.089
Yup, that was...
You're sick of that.

19:58.623 --> 19:59.689
Thanks.

20:00.624 --> 20:01.857
I'll, uh...

20:02.792 --> 20:04.025
I'll go get you some.

20:38.993 --> 20:40.860
Hey, Evan?

20:42.662 --> 20:44.629
Where should we put these?

20:44.631 --> 20:45.896
Oh, I'll take them.

20:45.898 --> 20:47.938
No, we can do it.
We don't mind.

20:48.700 --> 20:49.833
I got it.

20:53.904 --> 20:55.070
I made you some tea.

20:55.072 --> 20:56.771
- Thank you.
- Thank you, that's nice.

20:56.773 --> 20:57.905
- So sweet.
- I'll trade you.

20:57.907 --> 20:58.972
Uh, okay.

21:00.674 --> 21:01.940
<i>Gracias.</i>

21:01.942 --> 21:03.141
Excuse me.

21:28.132 --> 21:29.232
Oh, my God.

21:39.874 --> 21:41.241
Oh, sorry.

21:41.243 --> 21:44.143
We were trying to warm up.

21:44.145 --> 21:46.445
Yeah, I mean, we've
never seen one of these before.

21:46.447 --> 21:48.814
- A real one.
- It's okay.

21:48.816 --> 21:51.082
Just be careful. It's old.

21:53.985 --> 21:55.352
I see you've met Monkey.

21:55.354 --> 21:58.188
Yeah, this is Monkey.

21:58.190 --> 22:01.224
It's time for Monkey
to go to bed.

22:01.226 --> 22:03.226
- Bye, Monkey.
- Night-night, Monkey.

22:03.228 --> 22:05.027
- Night-night.
- Sweet dreams.

22:05.029 --> 22:06.029
Bye, Monkey.

22:10.032 --> 22:11.152
All right, Monkey.

22:14.069 --> 22:15.436
Go home, Monkey.

22:19.407 --> 22:21.941
You have so many records.

22:21.943 --> 22:23.742
Sorry. We had to try one.

22:23.744 --> 22:25.343
Stop apologizing, it's okay.

22:27.145 --> 22:30.013
I love this album.
You have good taste.

22:30.015 --> 22:32.148
This is like...

22:32.150 --> 22:34.517
An insane collection.

22:34.519 --> 22:37.052
- Yeah.
- It must be worth a fortune.

22:37.054 --> 22:39.487
Well, everything's
online now, so...

22:41.456 --> 22:45.091
But, uh, I love
the sound of vinyl.

22:45.093 --> 22:47.359
You're really into music.

22:47.361 --> 22:49.894
Well, it used to be my job.

22:49.896 --> 22:52.263
What? Like a record salesman?

22:52.265 --> 22:55.232
I was a DJ.

22:55.234 --> 22:56.533
Oh, my God. That's so cool!

22:56.535 --> 22:58.167
You're like Major Lazer!

22:59.170 --> 23:03.004
It's really a hobby now,
I haven't had a real gig in years.

23:05.407 --> 23:07.207
Wait, how old are you?

23:08.042 --> 23:09.842
I'm 43.

23:09.844 --> 23:13.145
- No fucking way.
- I can't believe you're 43.

23:13.147 --> 23:16.214
I thought you were, like,
28 or 30 at the most.

23:16.216 --> 23:18.349
Well, I got married
when I was 30.

23:19.150 --> 23:21.050
Where's your wife?

23:21.052 --> 23:23.118
She's at the beach with my kids.

23:23.120 --> 23:27.489
We were gonna spend
Father's Day there, but, uh, work happened.

23:27.491 --> 23:29.958
Oh, my God, you are all
alone on Father's Day.

23:29.960 --> 23:32.327
Poor Evan, we'll keep
you company!

23:32.329 --> 23:34.429
Hugs!

23:34.431 --> 23:36.831
No, it's fine.
We celebrated this morning.

23:38.133 --> 23:40.901
Whoa, you're not 43.

23:40.903 --> 23:42.435
You must work out,
like, every day.

23:42.437 --> 23:44.837
Yeah, I keep in shape.

23:44.839 --> 23:47.439
Not like when I was
in my 20s, but, uh...

23:50.109 --> 23:52.577
Come on, any guy that ripped

23:52.579 --> 23:54.445
is more into his own ass
than yours.

23:56.514 --> 23:59.382
Yeah, I mean, like, seriously,

23:59.384 --> 24:01.450
is that all you do?

24:01.452 --> 24:02.984
Oh, my God,

24:02.986 --> 24:04.418
I remember
I fucked this model once,

24:04.420 --> 24:06.553
and while we were having sex

24:06.555 --> 24:08.488
I caught him doing
crunches in the mirror.

24:08.490 --> 24:13.059
It was the gayest thing ever.

24:13.061 --> 24:17.829
I'd take somebody that's older and more
experienced over an Abercrombie model any day.

24:18.430 --> 24:20.230
Yeah.

24:23.433 --> 24:26.834
Well, hopefully one day
you'll find both.

24:28.069 --> 24:30.503
I don't know.

24:30.505 --> 24:32.471
Underwear models are the kind of guys
you fuck when you're 14.

24:32.473 --> 24:34.439
That's a statement.

24:36.475 --> 24:38.442
- This is your wife?
- Yup.

24:38.444 --> 24:39.876
I want to see it.

24:42.012 --> 24:44.613
Wow! She's so pretty.

24:44.615 --> 24:47.015
She's beautiful.
You're a lucky guy.

24:47.017 --> 24:49.350
Yeah, I certainly am.

24:49.352 --> 24:52.152
I'm just an architect, but, uh,

24:52.154 --> 24:53.953
she's the real deal.

24:53.955 --> 24:56.855
Most of what you see is hers.

24:58.123 --> 24:59.423
- She made all these?
- Yeah.

24:59.425 --> 25:00.425
Wow.

25:03.361 --> 25:06.162
They're so pretty.

25:06.164 --> 25:08.130
I love these colors.

25:08.132 --> 25:09.631
Red's my favorite.

25:09.633 --> 25:11.232
This is amazing.

25:11.234 --> 25:13.434
I actually studied art history.

25:13.436 --> 25:15.956
I'm no expert, I was only
there for a semester, but,

25:17.105 --> 25:18.371
this...

25:20.207 --> 25:23.341
This is like a Gaudi building,
but small.

25:26.011 --> 25:27.911
Yeah, my wife loves Gaudi.

25:29.647 --> 25:32.048
She was, uh,
she was born in Barcelona.

25:32.050 --> 25:33.349
Like me?

25:43.324 --> 25:46.059
English, English.
You guys sound too sexy.

25:47.594 --> 25:50.295
That's about the extent
of my Spanish anyway.

25:50.297 --> 25:52.463
My kids speak it perfectly.

25:54.365 --> 25:56.499
Your wife's an amazing artist.

25:56.501 --> 25:59.502
Why are these sculptures here?

25:59.504 --> 26:01.437
They should be in like, MOMA.

26:02.972 --> 26:05.006
Actually, um...

26:07.542 --> 26:09.376
It's not exactly MOMA...

26:11.645 --> 26:14.312
But she's having a big
gallery show in LA.

26:17.382 --> 26:20.150
Karen Alvarado.
That's such a pretty name.

26:20.152 --> 26:21.985
An architect and an artist.

26:21.987 --> 26:24.020
You guys
are like the perfect couple.

26:24.022 --> 26:26.956
And she's so hot.

26:26.958 --> 26:29.024
You must have sex,
like, all day.

26:29.026 --> 26:30.191
- Bel!
- What?

26:30.193 --> 26:32.059
I would.

26:32.061 --> 26:35.529
She sees a hot girl
and chases after her.

26:35.531 --> 26:38.231
Well, it's okay.
I have no complaints.

26:39.333 --> 26:40.933
Sorry, I was just being honest.

26:42.669 --> 26:45.003
No, no. It's fine.

26:45.005 --> 26:47.472
Um, but, uh...

26:48.273 --> 26:50.507
I must say

26:50.509 --> 26:54.076
I'm not used to girls just
being so open about that.

26:55.211 --> 26:56.477
About what?

26:56.479 --> 26:58.078
Sex?

26:58.080 --> 27:00.447
No, I mean... Yes.

27:00.449 --> 27:02.015
- Yeah.
- Yes.

27:03.317 --> 27:04.650
It's just sex.

27:07.186 --> 27:08.419
Right.

27:10.255 --> 27:12.289
Now you seem old.

27:16.693 --> 27:18.393
Sorry. So sorry.

27:34.409 --> 27:37.210
Twenty minutes away.

27:37.212 --> 27:39.445
How long have you
and your wife been together?

27:41.114 --> 27:44.549
I was 29 and she was 20.

27:44.551 --> 27:46.717
It's been awhile.

27:46.719 --> 27:49.554
So you haven't been
with anyone else in all those years?

27:49.556 --> 27:51.355
Fourteen years, nope.

27:51.357 --> 27:52.489
Wow.

27:53.691 --> 27:55.458
How is that even possible?

27:55.460 --> 27:58.160
Well, when you love someone...

27:58.162 --> 27:59.628
Come on, Evan.

27:59.630 --> 28:02.330
Humans are the only species
that practice monogamy.

28:02.332 --> 28:05.166
I mean, we're animals.
We're more animals than animals.

28:05.168 --> 28:07.301
It's in our DNA.

28:07.303 --> 28:10.103
Like, being with one person
your whole life,

28:10.105 --> 28:12.305
is going against
your own nature.

28:16.143 --> 28:17.209
Look.

28:18.511 --> 28:20.245
It's like this.

28:20.247 --> 28:22.180
I understand men.

28:22.182 --> 28:24.215
I know whenever I get married,

28:24.217 --> 28:26.817
my husband is gonna want to be
with other girls.

28:26.819 --> 28:30.387
So, I want to get comfortable
with having threesomes now,

28:30.389 --> 28:33.690
because I know that's the only way
he'll never cheat on me.

28:44.300 --> 28:45.400
Wow.

28:48.436 --> 28:50.837
So, are you guys...
What do you guys do?

28:50.839 --> 28:54.340
I mean, are you...
Are you in school or something?

28:54.342 --> 28:56.208
I mean...

28:56.210 --> 28:58.577
Actually,
we're flight attendants.

28:58.579 --> 29:00.145
Really?

29:00.147 --> 29:01.846
What would you like
for your entree, sir?

29:01.848 --> 29:03.147
We have chicken...

29:03.882 --> 29:05.215
And pasta.

29:09.186 --> 29:10.819
Please buckle
your seatbelt, sir.

29:10.821 --> 29:13.521
We may be encountering
some turbulence.

29:18.392 --> 29:19.625
So...

29:20.760 --> 29:22.660
Where you guys based out of?

29:22.662 --> 29:24.628
Everywhere.

29:24.630 --> 29:26.663
Last weekend we were in
New Zealand for 24 hours.

29:26.665 --> 29:28.231
It was awesome.

29:28.233 --> 29:30.866
Wow, how was that jet lag?

29:30.868 --> 29:33.301
We don't sleep.

29:33.303 --> 29:35.336
It's like being
a fake rock star.

29:35.338 --> 29:37.471
You know, you fly
around the world first class,

29:37.473 --> 29:39.806
drinks are on the house
and they pay you for it.

29:40.674 --> 29:43.308
I'm jealous.

29:43.310 --> 29:45.443
I once got offered a tour
when I was a DJ.

29:45.445 --> 29:48.245
Not like you guys, but, uh,
Tri-State area.

29:50.381 --> 29:55.318
Yeah, well, I think traveling
is the best way to get life experience.

29:55.320 --> 29:57.620
Especially when you're
only there for 24 hours.

29:57.622 --> 29:59.688
You really make the most of it.

29:59.690 --> 30:01.790
Yeah, we make the most of it.

30:01.792 --> 30:04.893
Unlike that fucking
starfish we work with. Ugh.

30:04.895 --> 30:06.427
Ugh, starfish.

30:06.429 --> 30:08.829
- Starfish?
- This girl we work with...

30:08.831 --> 30:10.630
She doesn't have to do
anything in bed,

30:10.632 --> 30:13.432
she just lies there
like a fucking starfish.

30:13.434 --> 30:15.634
Hence, starfish.

30:15.636 --> 30:17.335
I mean,
who'd want to fuck that?

30:17.337 --> 30:20.571
I don't understand
girls like that.

30:20.573 --> 30:24.408
When I'm with a guy,
I want him to have the time of his life.

30:24.410 --> 30:25.609
- No rules.
- None.

30:25.611 --> 30:28.244
Nothing's off limit, sexually.

30:28.246 --> 30:30.746
Sex with boundaries
isn't really sex.

30:30.748 --> 30:33.248
If our bodies are capable
of doing it,

30:33.250 --> 30:35.249
then we were meant to. Right?

30:50.998 --> 30:54.533
Oh, Evan?
Can I use your bathroom?

30:54.535 --> 30:58.003
Of course. It's, uh, down
the hall on the right.

30:58.537 --> 30:59.803
Thanks.

31:21.825 --> 31:24.459
I don't know any of these.

31:24.461 --> 31:26.828
Well, I have pretty
eclectic taste.

31:27.563 --> 31:30.364
You have Spanish music.

31:30.366 --> 31:32.466
Chilean, actually.

31:32.468 --> 31:34.628
My wife loves her,
Fran Valenzuela.

31:36.637 --> 31:38.004
Can you put it on?

31:38.905 --> 31:39.905
Sure.

31:47.045 --> 31:49.046
She's really talented.

31:49.048 --> 31:51.048
She started composing
when she was 13.

31:51.050 --> 31:54.317
This is her third album.

33:15.530 --> 33:16.796
Wow!

33:16.798 --> 33:18.678
How did you know
that would mix?

33:19.765 --> 33:22.566
DJ'ing is like mixing a drink.

33:22.568 --> 33:24.834
First you find
the right ingredients,

33:24.836 --> 33:26.868
then you find the blend.

33:30.472 --> 33:32.873
Evan, I have something
to confess.

33:34.375 --> 33:35.775
Yes?

33:35.777 --> 33:37.977
I'm glad we knocked
on your door.

33:38.878 --> 33:41.045
I'm having a way better
time here

33:41.047 --> 33:44.007
then at that stupid party we were
supposed to go to.

33:45.817 --> 33:48.652
Well, I have to confess,
it's not usually this exciting around here

33:48.654 --> 33:50.053
at 1:30 in the morning.

33:54.491 --> 33:57.092
It's like destiny
that we were meant to meet.

33:59.095 --> 34:01.135
Do you believe in destiny, Evan?

34:06.868 --> 34:08.835
I'm an architect.

34:08.837 --> 34:12.404
So obviously I believe
that things happen by your own design.

34:13.438 --> 34:15.672
Well, I do.

34:15.675 --> 34:19.043
I don't think
people just meet randomly.

34:19.045 --> 34:22.612
I think that
if we are here, together,

34:23.581 --> 34:25.614
it's because

34:25.617 --> 34:28.750
there's something we have to
learn from each other.

34:29.851 --> 34:31.018
Discover.

34:45.732 --> 34:46.965
It's here.

34:50.034 --> 34:51.902
I'll go get Genesis.

34:51.904 --> 34:53.837
I'll get your clothes.

35:02.179 --> 35:03.746
What the fuck!

35:17.127 --> 35:18.560
Guys!

35:20.629 --> 35:22.029
Guys, the car's outside.

35:25.633 --> 35:28.113
Guys, I have your clothes,
they're pretty much dry.

35:29.570 --> 35:31.136
Guys!

35:33.038 --> 35:34.972
All right, I'm coming in,

35:34.974 --> 35:37.040
I'm not looking, so excuse me.

35:44.147 --> 35:46.067
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

35:46.782 --> 35:48.182
What the fuck are you doing?

35:48.184 --> 35:51.151
- Come on, Evan. Join us.
- Yeah, join the party.

35:51.153 --> 35:53.953
- Come here.
- The car's outside.

35:53.955 --> 35:55.788
The car can wait. Come on.

35:57.824 --> 36:00.224
I'm gonna tell the driver
that you're coming out.

36:00.726 --> 36:02.026
Get dressed. Now.

36:02.028 --> 36:04.528
Please. Here's your clothes.

36:04.530 --> 36:05.929
Evan. Look at us.

36:06.797 --> 36:08.130
Come on...

36:08.132 --> 36:10.031
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Stop. Stop. Stop.

36:10.033 --> 36:11.899
I can't do this.
I'm married.

36:11.901 --> 36:13.901
Happily. Okay?

36:13.903 --> 36:15.502
Yes. You can.

36:15.504 --> 36:17.270
Hey, it's our little secret.

36:17.272 --> 36:18.871
Whoa, stop. Stop.

36:18.873 --> 36:20.105
It's just sex.
We're all adults here.

36:20.107 --> 36:21.973
I'm flattered.

36:21.975 --> 36:25.576
But really, I can't.
Please, get dressed.

36:25.578 --> 36:27.010
Yeah, you can.

36:27.012 --> 36:29.645
Come on, just one day.

36:29.647 --> 36:31.213
Just relax and enjoy it.

36:33.049 --> 36:34.716
You like this?

36:34.718 --> 36:36.999
Have you ever had two girls
do this to you before?

36:41.522 --> 36:43.762
- Happy Father's Day!
- Happy Father's Day!

40:01.283 --> 40:03.850
<i>It's time for the</i> Family Feud!

40:03.852 --> 40:06.319
<i>Introducing the Levy family!</i>

40:06.321 --> 40:08.354
- Morning, Daddy.
- Evan! Evan!

40:08.356 --> 40:09.356
Watch this!

40:13.226 --> 40:14.559
Belly! Belly! Catch! Catch!

40:18.164 --> 40:19.997
Sorry, Belly.

40:21.299 --> 40:22.932
I thought you guys left.

40:24.868 --> 40:27.135
- We made you breakky.
- I'm not hungry.

40:27.137 --> 40:28.970
Monkey, that's mine.

40:28.972 --> 40:32.440
<i>And the star of</i> Family Feud,
<i>Richard Dawson!</i>

40:42.249 --> 40:43.482
You two live together?

40:44.884 --> 40:45.884
Yeah.

40:46.451 --> 40:47.451
Where?

40:48.852 --> 40:49.852
Why, Evan?

40:51.554 --> 40:52.794
So I can drive you there.

40:54.924 --> 40:57.084
I haven't been home
in like four years.

40:58.494 --> 41:00.528
This could be our home.

41:00.530 --> 41:02.610
I'll drive you
wherever you want.

41:05.299 --> 41:06.599
Did I say something funny?

41:07.200 --> 41:08.266
Mmm-hmm.

41:09.434 --> 41:11.201
I want to go to Paris, Evan.

41:11.203 --> 41:13.469
No, let's go to Tokyo.

41:13.471 --> 41:15.571
London.

41:15.573 --> 41:17.372
Rome.

41:23.311 --> 41:25.351
Don't let your breakky get cold.

41:34.619 --> 41:36.319
Hey, baby.

41:36.321 --> 41:37.987
<i>Hey, you're alive.</i>

41:37.989 --> 41:41.156
Yeah, ah, barely.

41:41.158 --> 41:43.318
I forgot how strong
Vanessa's weed was.

41:44.026 --> 41:45.292
I just woke up.

41:45.294 --> 41:47.494
<i>You are such a lightweight.</i>

41:47.496 --> 41:49.629
- How are the kids?
<i>- Not so good.</i>

41:49.631 --> 41:51.364
- What happened?
- Evan!

41:51.366 --> 41:53.432
<i>Jake got stung by a jellyfish.
He was crying.</i>

41:54.233 --> 41:56.033
- Oh, no!
<i>- Yeah.</i>

41:56.035 --> 41:57.334
Poor little guy.

41:57.336 --> 41:59.235
<i>- He's okay now.</i>
- Where is he?

41:59.237 --> 42:01.070
<i>He's back at the beach.</i>

42:01.072 --> 42:02.337
<i>It was a little bit hairy
for a while,</i>

42:02.339 --> 42:03.905
<i>but now he's okay.</i>

42:03.907 --> 42:05.539
<i>What about you?
How's your project?</i>

42:05.541 --> 42:08.542
Great. Great. Great.

42:08.544 --> 42:11.077
Uh, I'm in a really good
groove now,

42:11.079 --> 42:12.545
so, home stretch.

42:13.914 --> 42:16.248
<i>Okay, then don't let me
interrupt you.</i>

42:16.250 --> 42:18.350
<i>Let's talk later.
You seem a little distracted.</i>

42:18.352 --> 42:20.151
No. That's not what I meant.

42:20.153 --> 42:21.153
It's just...

42:21.920 --> 42:25.955
so I don't have to think
about it, you know?

42:25.957 --> 42:27.656
Maybe if I get done early,
I can,

42:27.658 --> 42:29.357
I can drive out there.

42:29.359 --> 42:31.359
<i>Baby, I get it. Don't stress.</i>

42:31.361 --> 42:32.993
<i>Do what you have to do.</i>

42:32.995 --> 42:34.995
<i>- I love you.</i>
- Love you, too.

42:34.997 --> 42:37.464
<i>Don't smoke all our weed.</i>

42:37.466 --> 42:39.165
I won't. I promise.

42:40.233 --> 42:41.873
- Bye.
<i>- Ciao.</i>

42:43.702 --> 42:47.037
Shit! Shit! Shit!

42:51.242 --> 42:52.609
Are you hungry now?

42:52.611 --> 42:55.011
Get up! And get dressed!

42:55.013 --> 42:56.445
Right now!

42:56.447 --> 42:58.580
Excuse me, sir.
Can you tell me where Evan is?

42:58.582 --> 43:01.082
You know, that sweet guy that
saved two girls from the rain?

43:01.084 --> 43:02.450
He's gone. Get the fuck up.

43:04.486 --> 43:06.119
Let's go.

43:06.121 --> 43:08.087
I don't appreciate
your tone of voice.

43:08.089 --> 43:09.688
Go!

43:09.690 --> 43:11.956
Come on, Belly. Looks like
Evan lost his sense of humor.

43:11.958 --> 43:14.291
Go!

43:23.501 --> 43:25.068
Hello!

43:25.070 --> 43:26.070
Let's go!

43:31.407 --> 43:33.207
Where's Bel?

43:33.209 --> 43:35.169
I don't know,
she's not my friend.

43:37.011 --> 43:38.011
Bel!

43:39.980 --> 43:40.980
Bel!

43:46.018 --> 43:47.018
Bel?

43:52.490 --> 43:53.690
What the fuck are you doing?

43:55.124 --> 43:57.325
You tell us to get dressed.

43:57.327 --> 43:59.460
Come on. Playtime's over.

43:59.462 --> 44:01.495
Evan, can you hold me?

44:01.497 --> 44:03.396
Please, just once more.

44:03.398 --> 44:05.264
- Please, I miss your hugs.
- Bel. Listen to me.

44:05.266 --> 44:07.232
You're leaving. Now.

44:07.234 --> 44:08.366
Get dressed.

44:08.368 --> 44:09.700
- I love you.
- Bel...

44:09.702 --> 44:11.302
- I love you.
- No!

44:14.138 --> 44:15.471
I love you so much.

44:17.073 --> 44:18.740
God damn it! Fuck!

44:20.309 --> 44:23.344
I love you. I can't help it.

44:25.147 --> 44:26.312
I'm crazy about you.

44:33.386 --> 44:34.685
You have three minutes!

44:35.486 --> 44:36.619
I'll be outside!

44:38.254 --> 44:39.621
Get dressed!

44:48.163 --> 44:49.163
Let's go!

44:58.405 --> 45:02.574
What in the fuck
are you doing!

45:02.576 --> 45:06.077
You have any idea
what you've done?

45:06.079 --> 45:08.379
Yeah. It's called art.

45:08.381 --> 45:11.415
We were inspired
from last night. Remember?

45:11.417 --> 45:12.816
I'm calling the fucking police.

45:12.818 --> 45:14.284
Go ahead.

45:16.053 --> 45:17.586
What the fuck is so funny!

45:17.588 --> 45:19.821
I just have
a funny story for them.

45:19.823 --> 45:21.623
It's called
"To Catch a Predator."

45:26.828 --> 45:28.361
What the fuck are you
talking about?

45:28.363 --> 45:31.230
Fifteen to 20 years?

45:31.232 --> 45:32.564
I think it is 20.

45:32.566 --> 45:34.164
Fifteen gets you 20, right?

45:37.668 --> 45:39.669
- I don't believe it.
- You don't have to.

45:39.671 --> 45:41.337
The jury will.

45:41.339 --> 45:43.505
Statutory rape, Evan.

45:43.507 --> 45:45.273
Twenty years behind bars.

45:45.275 --> 45:46.741
And that's just for one of us.

45:46.743 --> 45:48.943
And I'm not planning
on taking a shower.

45:51.179 --> 45:52.646
I have evidence.

45:54.482 --> 45:56.416
Really?

45:56.418 --> 45:58.978
So how could you be a flight
attendant if you're only 15?

46:02.288 --> 46:03.554
What the fuck! What?

46:04.589 --> 46:06.790
We saw that in a movie, Evan.

46:06.792 --> 46:08.691
I told you he'd believe it.

46:08.693 --> 46:11.193
Do you want to check my ID?

46:11.195 --> 46:13.155
She doesn't have one,
she's too young.

46:15.430 --> 46:17.197
Okay.

46:17.199 --> 46:18.498
What do you want?

46:18.500 --> 46:20.620
We want to make breakky
for you every morning.

46:20.667 --> 46:21.800
Come on.

46:21.802 --> 46:23.768
Just tell me.
How much do you want?

46:23.770 --> 46:25.336
Don't be mad, Evan.

46:25.338 --> 46:27.204
That's not you.

46:27.206 --> 46:30.046
- You're different from the others.
- Yeah.

46:30.307 --> 46:31.341
How much!

46:33.744 --> 46:36.312
What do you think we are,
hookers?

46:36.314 --> 46:37.794
Jesus, Evan,
we're not fucking whores!

46:38.281 --> 46:39.414
Yeah.

46:39.416 --> 46:41.215
You're the fucking whore!

46:41.217 --> 46:42.983
Whore!

46:42.985 --> 46:45.352
Evan?

46:45.354 --> 46:46.419
It's Vivian!

46:47.521 --> 46:48.954
Do not move!

46:50.489 --> 46:51.555
Evan!

46:53.624 --> 46:55.391
Evan, I'm so sorry I'm late,

46:55.393 --> 46:57.826
but that storm blew
branches out all over town.

46:57.828 --> 47:00.361
It even knocked
two traffic lights out.

47:00.363 --> 47:02.763
I swear, I swear I was sitting
there for 15 minutes

47:02.765 --> 47:04.965
and I was trying to navigate,
but there was repair trucks.

47:04.967 --> 47:06.666
It's fine. It's fine.

47:06.668 --> 47:08.734
Actually, I'm feeling
much better.

47:08.736 --> 47:10.001
Oh, then that's really good

47:10.003 --> 47:11.535
because then this'll help.

47:11.537 --> 47:12.569
I'll give you
a relaxation massage,

47:12.571 --> 47:13.903
it'll help circulate.

47:13.905 --> 47:15.838
Actually... Karen should have
told you,

47:15.840 --> 47:17.906
I have a lot of work to do
this weekend.

47:17.908 --> 47:20.408
I love Karen. I love her
so much, how is she?

47:20.410 --> 47:22.810
She is so talented.

47:22.812 --> 47:24.545
I cannot wait
to see her exhibition.

47:24.547 --> 47:25.946
In fact, you know what?

47:25.948 --> 47:27.347
Jim and I are going
to drive up for the opening

47:27.349 --> 47:29.649
if I can get out
of that conference

47:29.651 --> 47:32.418
I have in Sonoma
with those massage therapists.

47:32.420 --> 47:33.660
You know how that can be.

47:35.722 --> 47:36.988
He doesn't want your massage.

47:38.724 --> 47:39.790
Do you, baby?

47:42.393 --> 47:43.860
Get back inside.

47:44.761 --> 47:45.994
Don't let me get cold.

47:48.330 --> 47:50.564
This is really upsetting, okay?

47:50.566 --> 47:51.831
I'm here to heal,

47:51.833 --> 47:54.466
but this is really...
This is upsetting!

47:54.468 --> 47:56.534
- It's upsetting!
- It's not what you think.

47:56.536 --> 47:58.402
No, no.
It's exactly what I think!

47:58.404 --> 47:59.603
But you know what?
It's your life.

47:59.605 --> 48:00.704
- Vivian, please.
- I... Don't.

48:00.706 --> 48:02.272
It's your relationship, Evan.

48:09.679 --> 48:11.980
Look, I'm a DJ like Evan!

48:11.982 --> 48:13.481
Why didn't you let
your girlfriend in?

48:13.483 --> 48:15.349
Are you ashamed of us?
Or are you fucking her, too?

48:15.351 --> 48:16.817
- Get out of my house!
- Be careful,

48:16.819 --> 48:18.885
these two cute little girls
can put you behind bars

48:18.887 --> 48:20.419
- for the rest of your life!
- Get out of my house!

48:20.421 --> 48:22.921
What would your client say?
Your neighbors?

48:22.923 --> 48:24.856
What would your wife say if we told
her everything we did last night?

48:24.858 --> 48:25.957
Get out!

48:28.428 --> 48:30.628
It's gonna be such a shame
to see your wife divorce you!

48:30.630 --> 48:31.996
And your business ruined

48:31.998 --> 48:34.031
over a single night
of perversion!

48:34.033 --> 48:35.565
You wanna go door-to-door
telling your neighbors

48:35.567 --> 48:36.933
you're a child molester?

48:36.935 --> 48:38.601
What would the other parents do?

48:38.603 --> 48:41.003
Let their kids play here if
you're a convicted pedophile?

48:42.304 --> 48:43.737
There's Evan!

48:43.739 --> 48:44.871
There's Evan!

48:48.008 --> 48:50.088
I didn't think
you had it in you.

49:12.928 --> 49:14.762
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

49:14.764 --> 49:16.830
I'd like to report a break-in.

49:16.832 --> 49:18.431
<i>You're calling from 458...</i>

49:21.701 --> 49:22.901
Can you give us a ride?

49:32.510 --> 49:33.510
Let's go.

50:03.538 --> 50:05.505
Well, this isn't awkward at all.

50:05.507 --> 50:06.672
Cool car, Evan.

50:17.781 --> 50:18.947
This one on the right.

50:20.382 --> 50:21.648
Out.

50:21.650 --> 50:22.815
You're not gonna get out
and say bye?

50:22.817 --> 50:23.882
Go.

50:27.586 --> 50:29.706
Don't you want to come in
and meet my mom?

50:33.557 --> 50:35.691
- Oh!
- Bye!

50:35.693 --> 50:37.573
Send our love
to Karen and the kids!

50:38.060 --> 50:39.060
Bye!

52:58.530 --> 52:59.596
Hello?

53:37.734 --> 53:38.934
Oh, my God!

54:23.009 --> 54:25.076
Oh!

54:29.014 --> 54:30.294
What the hell are you doing?

54:34.985 --> 54:37.185
Genesis, please,
this is crazy, untie me!

54:44.294 --> 54:46.127
What's the point of this?

54:47.963 --> 54:49.730
I'm a good person.

54:49.732 --> 54:50.831
I made a mistake.

54:52.700 --> 54:54.620
We can forget
this ever happened.

54:55.635 --> 54:57.168
Please! Please!

54:58.770 --> 55:00.490
Haven't you ever made a mistake?

55:22.755 --> 55:24.288
Daddy!

55:26.090 --> 55:28.124
Oh, Daddy!

55:29.993 --> 55:32.194
Look what I found.

55:33.963 --> 55:35.029
Oh, my God!

55:35.930 --> 55:37.797
You take that off.

55:37.799 --> 55:39.839
That's my daughter's.
You take that off!

55:41.134 --> 55:43.001
You like how it fits me, Daddy?

55:44.003 --> 55:45.236
- Look.
- Take those off,

55:45.238 --> 55:47.137
you fucking crazy bitch!

55:49.740 --> 55:50.740
Okay.

55:55.311 --> 55:57.912
You know,
every girl's first love

55:59.047 --> 56:00.313
is their daddy, huh?

56:05.051 --> 56:06.317
You're sick.

56:08.119 --> 56:09.285
You like what you see?

56:10.387 --> 56:12.755
Huh?
You like what you see?

56:12.757 --> 56:13.822
Daddy?

56:22.965 --> 56:24.398
- Huh?
- No.

56:24.400 --> 56:25.400
Bel.

56:26.367 --> 56:27.433
Untie me.

56:28.201 --> 56:30.035
Untie me, please.

56:30.037 --> 56:32.203
If you really love me,

56:33.104 --> 56:34.170
untie me.

56:36.006 --> 56:37.126
Ignore that asshole.

56:38.007 --> 56:39.127
He's not an asshole.

56:39.908 --> 56:41.141
He's my Daddy.

56:45.179 --> 56:47.580
You don't listen to her, Daddy.

56:47.582 --> 56:49.542
She doesn't love you
the way I do.

56:49.916 --> 56:51.983
I love you, Daddy.

56:51.985 --> 56:55.252
I've loved you ever since
Mommy brought you home.

56:55.254 --> 56:57.487
Remember that night
when we were all alone

56:57.489 --> 56:58.855
and you snuck into my room?

57:00.490 --> 57:02.457
And I pretended to be asleep.

57:02.459 --> 57:04.258
But when you took off
my clothes,

57:04.260 --> 57:06.493
I couldn't pretend any longer.

57:06.495 --> 57:09.262
We did things
you and Mommy never did.

57:10.931 --> 57:13.399
I hope you're not angry
at me anymore, Daddy.

57:14.868 --> 57:16.435
I only did that to Mommy

57:16.437 --> 57:18.437
because I wanted you
all to myself.

57:20.039 --> 57:23.074
Bel, Bel, untie me, please?

57:23.942 --> 57:26.143
Please.

57:26.145 --> 57:28.305
You can tuck me in
like you always did.

57:34.251 --> 57:35.371
What's wrong, Daddy?

57:36.085 --> 57:37.151
Huh?

57:38.419 --> 57:41.020
Don't you want to fuck
your little girl again?

57:41.022 --> 57:43.303
Did you forget what you did
to me all those years?

57:44.557 --> 57:46.024
Why did you do that to me?

57:47.359 --> 57:49.059
Why did you do that to me!

57:49.061 --> 57:50.501
- Bel...
- Why?

57:52.997 --> 57:54.430
Stop! Bel!

57:56.600 --> 57:58.366
Stop! Bel!

57:58.368 --> 57:59.433
Bel, stop!

57:59.435 --> 58:01.902
Why did you do that to me!

58:01.904 --> 58:04.070
Why!
Why did you do that to me!

58:04.072 --> 58:05.471
Stop! Stop!

58:05.473 --> 58:07.506
Bel! Stop, please!

58:07.508 --> 58:09.374
Stop it! Stop it!

58:21.886 --> 58:22.886
Shh.

58:24.922 --> 58:25.922
Untie me.

58:28.592 --> 58:31.527
What the fuck is that?

58:34.465 --> 58:36.465
You're not hiding something,
are you, Evan?

58:38.968 --> 58:40.435
What are you hiding here, huh?

58:40.437 --> 58:42.069
Come on, where is it, Daddy?

58:45.073 --> 58:47.340
It's Karen on FaceTime!

58:47.342 --> 58:49.108
- I've been dying to meet her.
- Answer it.

58:49.110 --> 58:50.943
- Let's get to know her.
- No! No!

58:50.945 --> 58:52.705
You're right,
this could get awkward.

58:53.579 --> 58:55.179
- What are you doing?
- Much better.

58:55.181 --> 58:56.914
Don't!

58:56.916 --> 58:58.548
Can a cock answer an iPhone?

58:58.550 --> 59:00.082
Yes, Belly,
but it's gotta be hard.

59:00.084 --> 59:01.349
Okay.

59:02.584 --> 59:04.284
No! Please!

59:04.286 --> 59:06.986
- It could be my kids!
- Hi Evan, welcome back.

59:06.988 --> 59:09.021
So? Have they ever seen
a cheating dick before?

59:09.023 --> 59:11.156
How about covered
in her lipstick?

59:11.158 --> 59:14.124
Okay! Okay, okay, okay,
okay, okay, okay. Please.

59:15.993 --> 59:18.394
Bel, I'll do whatever you want.

59:18.396 --> 59:19.661
Yes! Yes!

59:22.131 --> 59:23.664
Okay. Okay.

59:23.666 --> 59:26.133
Now, fuck me, Daddy!

59:26.135 --> 59:28.468
- Fuck me!
- Attaboy, Evan.

59:28.470 --> 59:29.602
Fuck her.

59:29.604 --> 59:32.071
Fuck her
like it was last night.

59:32.073 --> 59:33.238
Yeah, fuck her good!

59:34.341 --> 59:35.973
Fuck me, Daddy!

59:35.975 --> 59:38.342
Fuck me like you fuck
your little daughter!

59:41.645 --> 59:43.278
Doggy style, Belly!

59:48.983 --> 59:50.983
You want something to eat, Bel?

59:51.185 --> 59:52.185
No, I'm okay.

59:52.619 --> 59:54.419
Okay.

59:59.122 --> 01:00:00.722
Fuck me, Daddy!

01:00:00.724 --> 01:00:02.290
Fuck me like you fuck Mommy!

01:00:16.569 --> 01:00:19.170
Yeah, Daddy's little girl!

01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:23.407
You're a good little girl!

01:00:25.677 --> 01:00:27.977
- Fuck me, Daddy!
- Yeah!

01:00:27.979 --> 01:00:29.712
Fuck me like you fuck Mommy!

01:00:34.183 --> 01:00:35.249
Ow!

01:01:11.250 --> 01:01:12.616
Arghh!

01:01:14.118 --> 01:01:16.085
My scar! My scar! My scar!

01:01:16.087 --> 01:01:18.320
My surgery!

01:01:18.322 --> 01:01:20.555
You've been
a very bad boy, Evan!

01:01:20.557 --> 01:01:22.917
Please, please, please
take it out! Take it out!

01:01:24.259 --> 01:01:27.160
Oh, my God!

01:01:27.162 --> 01:01:28.327
Oh, my...

01:01:29.262 --> 01:01:30.328
...God!

01:01:35.333 --> 01:01:37.467
Why did you hit me, Daddy?

01:01:37.469 --> 01:01:38.749
Now we have to punish you.

01:02:01.189 --> 01:02:05.124
Welcome to America's
favorite game show,

01:02:05.126 --> 01:02:08.160
<i>Who Wants to be a Pedophile!</i>

01:02:08.162 --> 01:02:11.163
Where we give the audience
what they want!

01:02:11.165 --> 01:02:13.265
The chance to punish
a pedophile.

01:02:13.267 --> 01:02:15.233
But first,

01:02:15.235 --> 01:02:18.336
let's welcome our lovely,
beautiful and charming,

01:02:18.338 --> 01:02:20.571
Ms. Bel!

01:02:23.241 --> 01:02:24.440
Hello, Ms. Bel.

01:02:27.143 --> 01:02:28.610
For tonight's contestant,

01:02:28.612 --> 01:02:30.211
we have a very special one,

01:02:30.213 --> 01:02:32.546
he's not only an architect
but also a DJ,

01:02:32.548 --> 01:02:35.215
a husband, a father of two,

01:02:35.217 --> 01:02:36.282
possibly three.

01:02:36.284 --> 01:02:38.684
Four.

01:02:38.686 --> 01:02:41.753
All the way from
one percent land,

01:02:41.755 --> 01:02:44.655
Mr. Evan Webber!

01:02:48.460 --> 01:02:50.560
Ms. Bel, would you please
get our contestant ready?

01:02:50.562 --> 01:02:51.661
Sure.

01:03:03.773 --> 01:03:05.893
You're both crazy
fucking bitches!

01:03:07.643 --> 01:03:09.343
You look 21, you lied to me!

01:03:09.345 --> 01:03:11.345
Oh, like you lied to your wife?

01:03:11.779 --> 01:03:13.899
What I tell my wife is
none of your goddamn...

01:03:15.149 --> 01:03:17.616
God! God!

01:03:17.618 --> 01:03:20.685
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!
My ears! My ears!

01:03:20.687 --> 01:03:22.520
I'll go deaf! I'll go deaf!

01:03:24.756 --> 01:03:26.223
This is fucking serious!

01:03:27.491 --> 01:03:28.824
I could go deaf!

01:03:28.826 --> 01:03:30.425
The game hasn't started yet.

01:03:34.397 --> 01:03:35.930
Our first category...

01:03:38.934 --> 01:03:40.334
Schoolyards.

01:03:42.470 --> 01:03:44.337
How far away from school

01:03:44.339 --> 01:03:46.439
will Evan have
to pick up his kids?

01:03:46.441 --> 01:03:47.506
100 yards?

01:03:48.508 --> 01:03:49.608
500 yards?

01:03:50.710 --> 01:03:51.776
Or two miles?

01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:57.514
This is fucking sick!

01:04:01.318 --> 01:04:02.318
Arghh!

01:04:05.755 --> 01:04:07.955
Wrong answer.
Correct answer is

01:04:07.957 --> 01:04:10.257
you can't pick up
your kids from prison.

01:04:10.259 --> 01:04:12.359
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

01:04:12.361 --> 01:04:13.660
Please!

01:04:13.662 --> 01:04:15.395
What's our next category,
Ms. Bel?

01:04:15.397 --> 01:04:16.829
I love this one.

01:04:22.502 --> 01:04:23.869
Daddies.

01:04:26.339 --> 01:04:28.540
Evan, this should be
easy for you.

01:04:29.975 --> 01:04:32.776
How many family men
have survived this game?

01:04:38.315 --> 01:04:39.315
None.

01:04:41.918 --> 01:04:42.918
What was that?

01:04:44.019 --> 01:04:45.285
None.

01:04:45.287 --> 01:04:46.786
Correct!

01:04:50.056 --> 01:04:52.457
- Next question.
- Genesis.

01:04:53.959 --> 01:04:55.459
You've proved your point.

01:04:59.064 --> 01:05:01.531
God! I can't hear!
I can't hear!

01:05:02.432 --> 01:05:04.966
Please stop!

01:05:04.968 --> 01:05:07.328
All you have to do is
answer the question, Evan.

01:05:08.069 --> 01:05:09.069
Okay.

01:05:09.770 --> 01:05:10.836
Okay.

01:05:14.574 --> 01:05:17.509
Well, ask it, for fuck's sake!

01:05:17.511 --> 01:05:20.044
What's the proper punishment
for a pedophile?

01:05:20.046 --> 01:05:23.080
Is it prison where
you get raped every day

01:05:23.082 --> 01:05:25.048
and you never get to see
your family again?

01:05:25.050 --> 01:05:26.315
Castration?

01:05:27.083 --> 01:05:28.083
Or death?

01:05:36.891 --> 01:05:40.760
Tick-tock. Tick-tock.
Tick-tick-tock.

01:05:40.762 --> 01:05:42.962
Tick-tock. Tick-tock.
Tick-tock. Tick-tock.

01:05:43.763 --> 01:05:44.896
Ten seconds.

01:05:46.465 --> 01:05:53.403
Tick-tock. Tick-tock.
Tick-tock. Tick-tock.

01:05:55.540 --> 01:05:58.007
Well, looks like it's time for
our first commercial break.

01:05:58.009 --> 01:06:00.609
We'll be back after a message
from our sponsors.

01:06:00.611 --> 01:06:02.644
Hello. It's me, Louis!

01:06:02.646 --> 01:06:03.945
Mr. Webber?

01:06:09.950 --> 01:06:10.950
Who's Louis?

01:06:14.953 --> 01:06:16.486
Fucking douche bag.

01:06:17.788 --> 01:06:19.789
Get that sheet, cover him up.

01:06:27.697 --> 01:06:28.762
Shh!

01:06:39.773 --> 01:06:40.906
- You must be Louis.
- Yes.

01:06:40.908 --> 01:06:42.507
I'm Bernadette.
I'm Uncle Evan's niece.

01:06:42.509 --> 01:06:43.841
Oh, hi, nice to meet you.

01:06:43.843 --> 01:06:46.143
Obviously, you're with
Uncle Evan.

01:06:46.145 --> 01:06:48.512
Sorry, we're shooting
a music video.

01:06:48.514 --> 01:06:50.634
Well, you guys picked
an awesome location.

01:06:51.115 --> 01:06:52.115
Come on in.

01:06:55.885 --> 01:06:57.986
So where'd you come in from?

01:06:57.988 --> 01:07:00.688
- Dallas.
- Oh? I used to live in Austin.

01:07:00.690 --> 01:07:01.922
Oh, I've never been.

01:07:01.924 --> 01:07:03.623
Well, it's fun when
you're in college.

01:07:03.625 --> 01:07:05.558
Yeah, I went to Parsons.

01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:06.759
Oh, great school.

01:07:06.761 --> 01:07:08.093
I went to SVA.

01:07:08.095 --> 01:07:09.494
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:07:09.496 --> 01:07:11.829
- I'm Louis.
- Hi.

01:07:11.831 --> 01:07:13.797
- Hi. I'm...
- She's Macarena.

01:07:13.799 --> 01:07:16.399
- She's my friend from Spain.
- -Oh.

01:07:18.002 --> 01:07:20.102
- He's here to pick up...
- The art work outside.

01:07:20.104 --> 01:07:21.704
- Yes.
- Excuse me.

01:07:31.045 --> 01:07:32.745
- Somebody touch this?
- We didn't touch it.

01:07:32.747 --> 01:07:34.546
It's Aunt Karen's stuff,
we wouldn't go near it.

01:07:34.548 --> 01:07:36.447
I did see Evan in here earlier,

01:07:36.449 --> 01:07:37.548
maybe he did.

01:07:39.551 --> 01:07:40.984
Okay,

01:07:40.986 --> 01:07:43.052
'cause it's not supposed
to be like this.

01:07:43.054 --> 01:07:45.654
It's supposed to be bubble-wrapped
and packed up and ready to go.

01:07:45.656 --> 01:07:47.856
- Why would Evan do this?
- She said it wasn't us.

01:07:49.558 --> 01:07:50.558
Okay.

01:07:58.165 --> 01:07:59.798
Oh, fuck.

01:08:00.866 --> 01:08:01.932
Oh, my God.

01:08:04.001 --> 01:08:05.968
What the fuck did y'all do?

01:08:05.970 --> 01:08:07.210
What the fuck is this shit!

01:08:21.649 --> 01:08:23.216
We didn't want to tell you,
someone broke in

01:08:23.218 --> 01:08:24.483
and that's why Evan's out.

01:08:24.484 --> 01:08:25.850
- He was chasing them.
- Yeah.

01:08:25.853 --> 01:08:27.018
Shut the fuck up!

01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:28.819
Shut the fuck up,
both of you right now!

01:08:28.821 --> 01:08:29.953
Nobody fucking move!

01:08:32.055 --> 01:08:33.895
I'm calling the cops right now.

01:08:34.758 --> 01:08:36.024
Please don't tell Karen.

01:08:39.194 --> 01:08:41.234
This could be our little secret.

01:08:44.698 --> 01:08:46.898
Bitch, you're barking up
the wrong fucking tree.

01:08:47.801 --> 01:08:49.667
I'm from Oakland, ho!

01:08:49.670 --> 01:08:52.470
I know two ghetto ass
hos when I see 'em!

01:08:52.471 --> 01:08:54.505
Come to think of it,
Evan doesn't even have any fucking nieces.

01:08:54.506 --> 01:08:57.174
Who the fuck are you?

01:08:57.176 --> 01:08:59.743
You better hope the police
get here before Karen does.

01:09:02.179 --> 01:09:03.879
- What the fuck was that?
- Nothing.

01:09:03.881 --> 01:09:05.479
- Hey, wait.
- Wait.

01:09:05.482 --> 01:09:07.081
- It's nothing.
- Get out of my way!

01:09:07.082 --> 01:09:08.649
Shit.

01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:14.685
Shit!

01:09:15.787 --> 01:09:17.755
Mr. Webber!

01:09:17.756 --> 01:09:19.156
Are you okay? Oh, fuck!

01:09:19.158 --> 01:09:20.657
They're crazy!

01:09:20.658 --> 01:09:22.091
Close the door.
Close the door.

01:09:22.093 --> 01:09:23.225
Louis!

01:09:24.728 --> 01:09:28.529
- I gotta stop these crazy ass bitches.
- Louis, forget it!

01:09:28.531 --> 01:09:30.063
They're dangerous!

01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:37.502
No! No! Stop!

01:09:37.504 --> 01:09:38.836
Stop it!

01:09:38.837 --> 01:09:40.069
What are you doing!

01:09:53.749 --> 01:09:55.081
Looking for this?

01:09:58.218 --> 01:10:00.919
Louis! Be careful!

01:10:00.921 --> 01:10:02.954
They're crazy!

01:10:02.956 --> 01:10:06.691
Monkey in the middle!
Monkey in the middle!

01:10:06.693 --> 01:10:08.192
We can't say
that, Belly, it's racist.

01:10:08.194 --> 01:10:09.927
Okay, man in the middle!

01:10:10.895 --> 01:10:12.262
Give it to him!

01:10:12.264 --> 01:10:13.863
No, Genesis, give him that!

01:10:15.666 --> 01:10:16.965
Louis!

01:10:19.301 --> 01:10:20.702
Louis!

01:10:29.278 --> 01:10:32.846
Genesis! Please, this isn't his fault!
Please call an ambulance, help him!

01:10:35.950 --> 01:10:37.083
Fucker!

01:10:37.085 --> 01:10:38.818
Bel, please help him!

01:10:38.820 --> 01:10:42.321
Call an ambulance, I promise
I won't say anything!

01:10:42.323 --> 01:10:45.924
Bel, Genesis! Call an ambulance,
for fuck's sake!

01:10:45.926 --> 01:10:48.159
I think it's a little late
for an ambulance, Evan.

01:10:48.161 --> 01:10:51.295
He tripped, it's his fault.

01:10:51.297 --> 01:10:53.397
We were just playing
monkey in the middle.

01:10:53.399 --> 01:10:55.031
I mean, man in the middle.

01:10:55.899 --> 01:10:57.733
Oh, my God!

01:11:01.037 --> 01:11:02.670
You killed him!

01:11:03.138 --> 01:11:05.005
You killed him!

01:11:05.007 --> 01:11:08.074
Your wife killed him
with her shitty sculpture.

01:11:08.076 --> 01:11:09.975
This shit's dangerous, Evan.

01:11:09.977 --> 01:11:12.143
How can you keep
this here with kids?

01:11:12.145 --> 01:11:14.011
That's irresponsible parenting.

01:11:14.013 --> 01:11:16.013
Yeah maybe your wife
should stick to painting.

01:11:16.015 --> 01:11:18.048
Get the fuck away from me!

01:11:18.050 --> 01:11:19.416
Where do you think
you're going, Evan?

01:11:19.418 --> 01:11:21.184
Get the fuck off me!
Leave me alone!

01:11:21.186 --> 01:11:22.752
Wanna go for a little ride?

01:11:22.754 --> 01:11:24.253
You can't run away
from us, Daddy.

01:11:24.255 --> 01:11:26.021
You can't escape.

01:11:27.457 --> 01:11:28.722
Ahhh!

01:11:30.958 --> 01:11:34.160
This is what happens when you break
the rules of the game, Evan.

01:11:54.780 --> 01:11:56.380
This is just like art class.

01:12:36.854 --> 01:12:38.821
<i>What I did to Karen's statue</i>

01:12:38.823 --> 01:12:41.023
<i>is nothing compared
to what I'm going to do to you</i>

01:12:41.025 --> 01:12:43.992
<i>if I ever see your
fucking lying face again.</i>

01:12:43.994 --> 01:12:46.461
<i>I trusted you both,
how could you fuck my wife?</i>

01:12:47.996 --> 01:12:52.833
<i>Never come
near my family again.</i>

01:12:52.835 --> 01:12:56.036
<i>Disappear or you're
fucking dead.</i>

01:13:06.544 --> 01:13:08.278
Which way is MOMA?

01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:11.881
It's more like "momma."

01:13:19.088 --> 01:13:21.389
Ronnie is gonna have
a field day with this one.

01:13:21.391 --> 01:13:23.124
Yeah, I'm sure he will.

01:13:25.427 --> 01:13:27.161
That guy's a magician.

01:13:27.163 --> 01:13:29.196
Yeah.

01:13:29.198 --> 01:13:31.131
He can make anything disappear.

01:13:31.133 --> 01:13:32.332
Let's finish this.

01:13:48.547 --> 01:13:51.448
Wow, those were some
really long commercials.

01:13:51.450 --> 01:13:54.484
Thanks to our sponsor Louis
for that little lovely break.

01:14:00.924 --> 01:14:05.327
Now! Back to our
million dollar question.

01:14:06.595 --> 01:14:09.429
What is the proper punishment
for a pedophile?

01:14:11.265 --> 01:14:13.366
Please.

01:14:13.368 --> 01:14:16.369
I love my children.
I love my wife.

01:14:16.371 --> 01:14:18.404
I'm a good father.

01:14:18.406 --> 01:14:20.939
How can you judge anyone?

01:14:20.941 --> 01:14:22.040
You're murderers.

01:14:22.042 --> 01:14:24.042
Is that your final answer?

01:14:24.044 --> 01:14:26.177
Cause you're gonna go deaf
in about 10 seconds from now.

01:14:26.179 --> 01:14:27.878
Please, Genesis!

01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:29.412
I'm a good father!

01:14:29.414 --> 01:14:30.880
Until yesterday.

01:14:30.882 --> 01:14:32.962
That doesn't change
how much I love them!

01:14:42.890 --> 01:14:45.090
Do you really love them, Evan?

01:14:47.059 --> 01:14:48.125
Really?

01:14:50.194 --> 01:14:52.234
More than anything in the world.

01:14:54.263 --> 01:14:56.964
So why didn't you think of
them when you were inside us?

01:14:56.966 --> 01:14:58.131
Yeah, why, Evan?

01:14:59.900 --> 01:15:02.501
Last night had nothing
to do with my family.

01:15:02.503 --> 01:15:04.603
Damn right it didn't, Evan!

01:15:04.605 --> 01:15:07.205
It had nothing
to do with them.

01:15:07.207 --> 01:15:09.340
Your family are victims.

01:15:09.342 --> 01:15:12.443
Victims of your sleazy, disgusting,
perverted behavior.

01:15:13.044 --> 01:15:14.978
Jake. Lisa.

01:15:16.580 --> 01:15:19.014
They don't deserve
a father like you.

01:15:19.016 --> 01:15:21.056
This is what you did
to your family.

01:15:22.885 --> 01:15:24.118
You pervert.

01:15:29.657 --> 01:15:32.058
Genesis, please,
this isn't the answer!

01:15:32.060 --> 01:15:33.426
Wrong answer.

01:15:34.294 --> 01:15:36.528
Correct answer is death.

01:15:38.931 --> 01:15:40.891
We'll be back
after this commercial break.

01:15:44.001 --> 01:15:45.067
Death?

01:15:46.102 --> 01:15:47.469
Death?

01:15:48.170 --> 01:15:50.371
You're gonna kill me?

01:15:50.373 --> 01:15:53.307
You're gonna fucking kill me!

01:15:53.309 --> 01:15:56.977
Why? Why!
Because I fucked you?

01:15:56.979 --> 01:15:59.612
You fucked me!
You fucked me!

01:15:59.614 --> 01:16:03.616
You came to my house!
You came to me!

01:16:03.618 --> 01:16:05.918
I got you a car,
I brought you your clothes,

01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:08.220
you took a fucking bubble bath!

01:16:08.222 --> 01:16:12.190
You wanted it! You wanted it!
You came on to me!

01:16:12.192 --> 01:16:14.091
What was I supposed to do?

01:16:14.093 --> 01:16:17.561
You sucked my cock, you both
fucking sucked my cock!

01:16:17.563 --> 01:16:21.464
It was free pizza!
Free fucking pizza!

01:16:21.466 --> 01:16:23.566
It just shows up
at my fucking door!

01:16:23.568 --> 01:16:25.601
What am I supposed to do?

01:16:25.603 --> 01:16:28.670
"We're flight attendants.
Come on, fuck us!

01:16:28.672 --> 01:16:31.639
"No one will know.
Come on, fuck us!"

01:16:31.641 --> 01:16:34.975
Oh, twosomes, threesomes.
It doesn't matter!

01:16:34.977 --> 01:16:38.011
Starfish! Husbands!
You don't give a fuck,

01:16:38.013 --> 01:16:41.014
you'll just fuck anything,
you'll just fuck anything!

01:16:41.016 --> 01:16:43.116
Well, you lied to me,
I tried to help you!

01:16:43.118 --> 01:16:44.450
I let you in,

01:16:44.452 --> 01:16:47.352
I was a good guy,
I'm a good father!

01:16:47.354 --> 01:16:49.620
And you just fucking fucked me!

01:16:49.622 --> 01:16:52.289
What?
Now, you're gonna kill me!

01:16:52.291 --> 01:16:54.291
You're gonna kill me? Why?

01:16:54.293 --> 01:16:56.626
Why? 'Cause you fucked me?

01:16:56.628 --> 01:16:59.662
What the fuck-fuck-fuck,
this is fucking insane!

01:17:05.101 --> 01:17:07.001
You're to be executed at dawn.

01:17:10.972 --> 01:17:13.006
If I were you,

01:17:13.008 --> 01:17:15.975
I wouldn't waste my last
few hours crying about it.

01:17:19.346 --> 01:17:20.512
I'm sorry, Daddy.

01:17:23.249 --> 01:17:24.482
It is the only way.

01:17:27.052 --> 01:17:28.118
Bel?

01:17:35.258 --> 01:17:37.525
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:17:38.593 --> 01:17:40.093
Oh, my God!

01:18:45.423 --> 01:18:47.724
FaceTime. Karen!

01:18:49.626 --> 01:18:51.360
FaceTime. Karen.

01:18:53.329 --> 01:18:55.596
Digging a grave
is fucking tiring.

01:18:55.598 --> 01:18:57.197
And filthy.

01:18:57.199 --> 01:18:58.665
Your wife's clothes
are gonna need dry cleaning.

01:18:58.667 --> 01:18:59.667
What's that?

01:19:02.637 --> 01:19:04.503
You can't have access
to an iPad, Evan.

01:19:04.505 --> 01:19:06.585
You could be trying
to reach a child.

01:19:12.143 --> 01:19:15.378
Let's face it, Evan.
You're a monster.

01:19:15.380 --> 01:19:18.314
Or should I say monster!

01:19:20.184 --> 01:19:21.184
What?

01:19:22.417 --> 01:19:24.551
Monster surprised?

01:19:24.553 --> 01:19:26.352
How do you know about that?

01:19:26.354 --> 01:19:28.120
Oh, monster confused!

01:19:29.288 --> 01:19:30.688
How the fuck do you know that!

01:19:30.690 --> 01:19:32.655
Monster will be quiet!

01:19:35.191 --> 01:19:36.391
You spied on me?

01:19:38.394 --> 01:19:39.394
On my kids?

01:19:40.462 --> 01:19:42.196
Oh, my fucking God!

01:19:42.198 --> 01:19:44.231
Oh, my fucking God! Jesus!

01:19:44.233 --> 01:19:45.832
I'm so fucking stupid!

01:19:45.834 --> 01:19:46.834
Yeah, you are.

01:19:51.671 --> 01:19:54.439
Monster retarded.

01:19:57.877 --> 01:19:59.676
Let's change, I feel gross.

01:20:03.781 --> 01:20:05.314
Look at all this shit.

01:20:15.692 --> 01:20:18.325
<i>This is you, Evan.</i>

01:20:18.327 --> 01:20:21.487
This is gonna be your little fucking head,
you fucking cheater!

01:20:23.830 --> 01:20:26.631
I love this color!
Red's my favorite!

01:20:59.260 --> 01:21:01.793
No! No!
Gotta be pretty for your funeral.

01:21:01.795 --> 01:21:03.294
He's so hairy.

01:21:03.296 --> 01:21:04.495
No!

01:21:04.497 --> 01:21:06.296
You don't wanna lose an ear.

01:21:06.298 --> 01:21:07.298
Hold still.

01:21:08.699 --> 01:21:10.933
There we go.
You look pretty.

01:21:10.935 --> 01:21:12.801
There's Evan cutie!

01:21:17.606 --> 01:21:18.839
There you have it.

01:21:22.343 --> 01:21:24.277
Oh, now we see
your pretty face.

01:21:24.279 --> 01:21:25.645
Fucking bitches!

01:21:33.319 --> 01:21:35.519
"I love the sound
of vinyl. I'm Evan."

01:21:38.556 --> 01:21:39.556
Watch this, Evan.

01:21:59.004 --> 01:22:00.070
Jackpot!

01:22:04.576 --> 01:22:05.708
Is that real?

01:22:07.911 --> 01:22:12.080
What a clever way to hide
this from the kids, Evan!

01:22:12.082 --> 01:22:15.416
You know, most firearm deaths are
a family member of the gun owner.

01:22:17.919 --> 01:22:19.085
I don't own a gun.

01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:21.486
It's dangerous.

01:22:24.990 --> 01:22:25.990
Untie him.

01:22:28.860 --> 01:22:30.493
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

01:22:36.966 --> 01:22:39.000
Genesis, please don't
point that at me.

01:22:39.002 --> 01:22:40.601
I know,

01:22:40.603 --> 01:22:42.769
it's cheating.
We still have 90 minutes.

01:22:42.771 --> 01:22:45.571
But you were keeping secrets
from us, Evan.

01:22:45.573 --> 01:22:47.706
Had you gotten to this before us

01:22:47.708 --> 01:22:50.475
I don't think we'd be
having this conversation.

01:22:50.477 --> 01:22:51.576
And you wouldn't do the same?

01:22:51.578 --> 01:22:53.644
I'm not like you, Evan.

01:22:53.646 --> 01:22:56.546
I don't own a gun,
I don't shoot people.

01:22:56.548 --> 01:22:59.309
I sure as hell don't bend the rules
for my own convenience.

01:23:01.650 --> 01:23:02.850
Untie him, Belly.

01:23:07.354 --> 01:23:08.987
I don't want him to kick me.

01:23:08.989 --> 01:23:10.555
He won't.

01:23:10.557 --> 01:23:11.822
He kicks, I shoot.

01:23:12.490 --> 01:23:13.857
He knows that.

01:23:13.859 --> 01:23:15.024
Don't you, Evan?

01:23:19.562 --> 01:23:20.728
What do you want?

01:23:21.863 --> 01:23:23.930
I wanna play hide and seek.

01:23:25.532 --> 01:23:26.598
What?

01:23:30.870 --> 01:23:33.036
Thirty seconds.
Only inside the house.

01:23:33.038 --> 01:23:34.837
You leave the house, I shoot.

01:23:36.439 --> 01:23:38.559
What're you gonna do
when you find me?

01:23:39.741 --> 01:23:41.975
Well, if we don't
find you by sunrise,

01:23:43.444 --> 01:23:44.444
we'll leave.

01:23:45.745 --> 01:23:48.513
- Bullshit.
- Thirty seconds. Go! Go!

01:23:48.515 --> 01:23:49.847
- Go!
- Go!

01:23:52.016 --> 01:23:54.951
30, 29...

01:23:54.953 --> 01:23:57.920
28, 27...

01:23:57.922 --> 01:23:59.955
26, 25...

01:24:01.457 --> 01:24:04.659
24, 23, 22...

01:24:09.964 --> 01:24:11.898
Go!

01:24:11.900 --> 01:24:14.032
Ready or not? Here we come!

01:24:20.505 --> 01:24:22.606
Evan!

01:24:23.774 --> 01:24:26.008
You can't hide from us.

01:24:27.043 --> 01:24:28.043
Here we come.

01:24:33.549 --> 01:24:34.882
Evan?

01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:41.987
We can smell you, Evan.

01:24:46.559 --> 01:24:47.759
Daddy?

01:24:47.761 --> 01:24:49.494
Psst! In here.

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.735
- Evan?
- Oh, Evan?

01:25:00.537 --> 01:25:02.004
Are you here, monster?

01:25:07.577 --> 01:25:08.843
Evan?

01:25:15.116 --> 01:25:16.182
Evan?

01:25:17.551 --> 01:25:18.784
Shit!

01:25:20.887 --> 01:25:22.520
Evan!

01:25:25.891 --> 01:25:27.758
Yeah, there he goes!
Stop!

01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:28.892
Evan! Stop!

01:25:30.761 --> 01:25:32.228
Oh, fuck!

01:25:32.230 --> 01:25:34.597
Don't fucking move!

01:25:34.599 --> 01:25:36.632
Help me! Help me!

01:25:36.634 --> 01:25:38.767
- Scream all you fucking want!
- Help me!

01:25:38.769 --> 01:25:41.136
No one's fucking home!
We tried every house!

01:26:35.788 --> 01:26:37.288
Are you ready!

01:26:37.290 --> 01:26:39.857
Please don't do this!

01:26:39.859 --> 01:26:41.592
- Time to say goodbye!
- Please! Please!

01:26:42.527 --> 01:26:43.660
Help!

01:26:44.561 --> 01:26:46.762
Help me!

01:26:46.764 --> 01:26:48.029
Please, somebody help me!

01:26:48.031 --> 01:26:49.163
Are you religious?

01:26:49.165 --> 01:26:52.099
Help! Please somebody, help!

01:26:53.167 --> 01:26:55.201
Please, let me go!

01:26:55.203 --> 01:26:58.170
Help! Please help me!
Somebody help me!

01:26:59.739 --> 01:27:01.873
No! Help me!

01:27:01.875 --> 01:27:04.141
No! No! No! No! No!

01:27:04.143 --> 01:27:06.543
No, help! Help!

01:27:06.545 --> 01:27:08.711
One, two, three!

01:27:10.613 --> 01:27:12.213
Whoopsie-daisy!

01:27:14.250 --> 01:27:17.251
So Evan, did we
hurt your shoulder?

01:27:17.253 --> 01:27:19.886
We want you
to be comfy, Evan.

01:27:31.965 --> 01:27:34.166
Help! Help!

01:27:36.869 --> 01:27:39.170
Help! Help!

01:27:40.939 --> 01:27:42.773
Don't move, Evan. You might
get dirt in your eyes.

01:27:42.775 --> 01:27:44.341
Yeah, close your eyes, baby.

01:27:44.343 --> 01:27:46.810
Help! Help!

01:27:47.178 --> 01:27:48.811
Help!

01:27:48.813 --> 01:27:52.147
Help! Help! Help!

01:27:52.149 --> 01:27:55.216
Help! Help! Help!

01:27:57.219 --> 01:27:59.987
Please. Please.

01:27:59.989 --> 01:28:01.269
Please. Please, don't do this.

01:28:02.323 --> 01:28:06.259
Please! Bel. Please.

01:28:06.261 --> 01:28:08.341
It looks like he's trying
to communicate.

01:28:08.428 --> 01:28:09.428
Please.

01:28:13.098 --> 01:28:15.458
If you promise to behave,
I'll take out the gag.

01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:17.400
Okay.

01:28:28.878 --> 01:28:32.080
Don't do this. Please?

01:28:32.082 --> 01:28:34.949
I'll do whatever you want.
I'll do whatever you want.

01:28:34.951 --> 01:28:36.016
Whatever!

01:28:38.853 --> 01:28:42.021
Even calling your family
and telling them everything you did to us?

01:28:42.023 --> 01:28:43.389
Yes.

01:28:43.391 --> 01:28:45.491
Yes. Yes. Yes. I'll tell them.

01:28:45.493 --> 01:28:46.825
I'll tell them.

01:28:48.494 --> 01:28:51.729
Okay, let's give him a lifeline.

01:28:51.731 --> 01:28:54.898
I love the lifeline part.
Let's see.

01:28:54.900 --> 01:28:56.766
But the lifeline
is a phone call.

01:28:56.768 --> 01:28:58.968
Not FaceTime.

01:28:58.970 --> 01:29:01.403
Your wife's not gonna
see you like this.

01:29:01.405 --> 01:29:03.738
<i>Hi, this is Karen Alvarado,</i>

01:29:03.740 --> 01:29:06.173
<i>please leave a message
or send a text. Ciao.</i>

01:29:07.809 --> 01:29:09.241
Go ahead, talk.

01:29:11.978 --> 01:29:15.113
Honey. I'm sorry for
what I'm gonna tell you.

01:29:16.482 --> 01:29:17.815
They made me.

01:29:18.850 --> 01:29:20.016
Fuck!

01:29:21.084 --> 01:29:23.151
Call 911!

01:29:23.153 --> 01:29:25.520
- Call 911! I've been kidnapped...
- Evan, Evan...

01:29:25.522 --> 01:29:27.388
- ...by two girls!
- Evan!

01:29:27.390 --> 01:29:29.056
Call 911!

01:29:29.058 --> 01:29:30.924
- Call 911!
- No, no, no, Evan!

01:29:30.926 --> 01:29:34.160
- You broke the rule.
- Evan, why did you do that?

01:29:34.162 --> 01:29:36.028
Well, now she'll
fucking find you!

01:29:36.030 --> 01:29:37.929
Not really.

01:29:37.931 --> 01:29:40.851
I hung up as soon as it hit voice mail.
I knew you'd pussy out.

01:29:44.336 --> 01:29:45.436
You fucking whores!

01:29:47.439 --> 01:29:50.307
You fucking whores!

01:29:50.309 --> 01:29:53.810
I'll fucking kill you,
you fucking-fuck bitch cunt!

01:29:53.812 --> 01:29:55.945
I'll fucking kill you!
You fucking bitches!

01:29:55.947 --> 01:29:59.114
Oh, there's Evan. There he is!

01:29:59.116 --> 01:30:00.949
We missed you.

01:30:00.951 --> 01:30:02.183
Fucking whores!

01:30:05.920 --> 01:30:06.920
Knock-knock!

01:30:08.955 --> 01:30:11.456
I said knock-knock.

01:30:11.458 --> 01:30:13.291
No!

01:30:13.293 --> 01:30:14.992
I don't think he can talk.

01:30:14.994 --> 01:30:16.393
Okay. Knock-knock.

01:30:16.395 --> 01:30:17.794
Who's there?

01:30:17.796 --> 01:30:20.329
- Cheating Evan.
- Cheating Evan who?

01:30:20.331 --> 01:30:22.331
Cheating "Evan-tually"
gets you killed.

01:30:22.531 --> 01:30:24.498
No! No!

01:30:26.067 --> 01:30:28.268
- Ready, Evan?
- No!

01:30:28.270 --> 01:30:30.069
No!

01:30:30.071 --> 01:30:31.937
- One!
- No!

01:30:31.939 --> 01:30:33.038
- Two.
- Do it!

01:30:33.040 --> 01:30:34.939
- No! No!
- Three!

01:30:42.512 --> 01:30:44.212
Look at his face.

01:30:48.950 --> 01:30:51.017
We got you good.

01:30:51.019 --> 01:30:53.452
You didn't really think we
were gonna kill you, did you?

01:30:53.454 --> 01:30:55.320
We're not animals.

01:30:55.322 --> 01:30:57.322
It was just a game, Evan.

01:30:57.324 --> 01:31:00.158
A game? A game?

01:31:00.160 --> 01:31:02.593
You know what?

01:31:02.595 --> 01:31:06.530
For a moment, I thought
you were the one who'd say no.

01:31:06.532 --> 01:31:09.399
And now we have to play
a game with someone else.

01:31:10.934 --> 01:31:13.014
You know what's funny?
They never say no.

01:31:14.403 --> 01:31:16.337
No matter who they are.

01:31:16.339 --> 01:31:19.340
No matter how much
they love their families.

01:31:19.342 --> 01:31:20.607
You're all the same.

01:31:24.345 --> 01:31:25.345
Bye, Evan.

01:31:28.148 --> 01:31:29.948
You were my favorite.

01:31:31.850 --> 01:31:33.617
Oh!

01:31:33.619 --> 01:31:35.885
Wish me happy birthday.
I turn 22 next week.

01:31:35.887 --> 01:31:37.486
Yeah.

01:31:37.488 --> 01:31:39.855
I freaked out
when I turned 18.

01:31:39.857 --> 01:31:42.290
But you made me feel 15 again.
Thanks, Evan.

01:31:44.160 --> 01:31:45.526
Let's get out of here.

01:31:45.528 --> 01:31:48.161
Oh, I almost forgot.
Yes, your phone.

01:31:52.332 --> 01:31:55.000
You know you really should be
more careful with Facebook.

01:31:55.002 --> 01:31:58.403
If you don't log out someone could do
terrible things with it.

01:31:58.405 --> 01:32:01.405
Post something really personal
for all your friends to see.

01:32:04.976 --> 01:32:07.477
Look closely.
So you'll remember us.

01:32:09.880 --> 01:32:10.980
<i>Yes, Evan, fuck her!</i>

01:32:10.982 --> 01:32:12.081
<i>Fuck me, Daddy!</i>

01:32:12.083 --> 01:32:13.115
<i>Okay.</i>

01:32:14.550 --> 01:32:18.252
<i>Attaboy, Evan. Fuck her!</i>

01:32:18.254 --> 01:32:21.088
<i>Fuck me! Fuck me!</i>

01:32:21.090 --> 01:32:22.956
I'm sure you'll get a
lot of likes though.

01:32:22.958 --> 01:32:24.223
<i>Doggy style, Belly!</i>

01:32:24.225 --> 01:32:25.657
Enjoy!

01:32:27.125 --> 01:32:28.592
Oh!

01:32:28.594 --> 01:32:31.928
Bye, Evan! Muah!
We'll miss you!

01:32:35.565 --> 01:32:36.631
Oh!

01:32:39.601 --> 01:32:41.368
No!

01:32:43.271 --> 01:32:45.004
Oh, no!

01:33:16.232 --> 01:33:18.700
<i>Fuck me, Daddy!</i>

01:33:18.702 --> 01:33:20.702
God, God!

01:35:01.034 --> 01:35:04.569
Take your bags to your rooms.
Then go use the bathroom.

01:35:04.571 --> 01:35:07.638
And then we're gonna
go see Monkey, okay?

01:35:07.640 --> 01:35:09.172
- Are you guys tired?
- Yeah!

01:35:09.174 --> 01:35:10.506
Monkey?

01:35:11.608 --> 01:35:12.674
Monkey?

01:35:29.291 --> 01:35:30.524
Daddy had a party.

01:35:31.305 --> 01:35:37.471
