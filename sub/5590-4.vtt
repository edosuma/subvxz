You know, at the funeral,
I was thinking --

09:42.079 --> 09:44.913
Beverly was sick, but...

09:44.915 --> 09:48.149
She never stopped
loving her daughter.

And I don't believe
that juliette has, either.

09:51.721 --> 09:53.587
Maybe I'm just being
too impatient.

Maybe I should just trust
that what binds us isn't broken,

somewhere.

the perfect introduction for you

at highway 65

to say it,

Rayna hasn't done so badly
by you.

11:17.985 --> 11:20.485
She's got you at the opry, which
is half the battle in this town.

on your arm in public

Is not the right look
for your career.

that doctor of yours.

27:00.190 --> 27:01.422
I'm not sure
I can reach him right now.

not being a thing...

27:45.291 --> 27:46.356

27:46.358 --> 27:48.191
...Um, that was stupid.

27:48.193 --> 27:50.626

it really is a gift,

Y-you have "dru"--

28:06.408 --> 28:09.041
That didn't even make an album.
It got voted off by the band.

"drunk moon"?

the side of conventional songs

Rock's the same way.

29:15.788 --> 29:17.687
Yeah, when my parents
got divorced,

29:17.689 --> 29:19.622
Neither one of them felt all
that comfortable talking to me

they were feeling.

and more about doing.

to think about

What, like,
the rock equivalent was,

29:49.815 --> 29:50.814
But I don't think
there is one.

29:50.816 --> 29:52.282
I don't think so.

29:52.284 --> 29:54.384
I mean, between this show being
a live radio broadcast

no matter how big they get,

That all that matters
is what happens onstage?

Wake up.

35:52.068 --> 35:53.934
What?

35:53.936 --> 35:55.936
There's someone on the phone
for you.

35:55.938 --> 35:57.003
Is it work?

35:57.005 --> 35:58.771
No, it's --

35:58.773 --> 36:00.806
If it's not about work,
then I don't care.

36:07.580 --> 36:09.980
Okay, I told her.
She said she doesn't care.

36:09.982 --> 36:11.314
[ cadence crying ]

36:11.316 --> 36:13.349

Anything else?

Hey. It's me.

36:23.190 --> 36:25.390
You mind if I come in?

36:28.595 --> 36:29.961
Thought it was tradition

36:29.963 --> 36:32.630
To keep the dressing-room doors
open around here,

36:32.632 --> 36:34.632
You know,
unless you're getting dressed.

36:34.634 --> 36:37.501
I've never been
so embarrassed.

36:37.503 --> 36:39.135
Yeah, that sucked.

36:39.137 --> 36:42.872
But I'm pretty sure
you've been through worse.

36:42.874 --> 36:45.040
Layla, you put on
a hell of a show tonight.

36:45.042 --> 36:46.207
[ breathes raggedly ]
you're part of history now.

36:46.209 --> 36:47.775
Nothing and nobody
changes that.

Didn't go
the way I planned.

36:49.378 --> 36:51.444
Ah, you got overshadowed.
So what?

36:51.446 --> 36:53.779
Least you got to have
your opry debut.

36:53.781 --> 36:55.113
Some of us might never
get the chance.

36:56.483 --> 36:58.483
Oh.

36:58.485 --> 37:00.284
Now I'm<i> more</i> embarrassed.
I'm sorry.

37:00.286 --> 37:01.351
No. No, don't be.

37:01.353 --> 37:02.618
All I'm trying to say is,

37:02.620 --> 37:05.487
It's all right to be happy
with what you got.

37:05.489 --> 37:06.888
Even if
it ain't perfect.

Hey.

I just want to say
that I'm sorry

37:18.966 --> 37:21.399
That I haven't really
been able to reach you.

37:21.401 --> 37:25.369
I know
that I may not always get it,

37:25.371 --> 37:28.038
But I know
how powerful music can be

37:28.040 --> 37:29.672
When it comes
to reaching people.

37:29.674 --> 37:31.874
I want to reach you,
scarlett.

37:31.876 --> 37:34.476
I want you to know
what I'm feeling --

37:34.478 --> 37:37.345
Not just
as some doctor...

37:37.347 --> 37:39.113
But as the man
that loves you.

37:40.816 --> 37:41.781
So...

Maybe I'm a glutton
for punishment.

You're a stronger man
than me.
