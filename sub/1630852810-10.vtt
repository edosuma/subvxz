[man] Hey!

00:26.192 --> 00:29.863
Oh, my! I never thought
I'd live to braid a queen's hair.

00:29.946 --> 00:32.323
I always thought
you'd be dead in a ditch by now.

00:32.407 --> 00:34.743
Why is it that every time
you're braiding my hair

00:34.826 --> 00:36.369
you tell me I'm going to die?

00:38.163 --> 00:39.956
[grunting]

00:40.749 --> 00:41.916
Braids hurt my brain.

00:42.792 --> 00:45.211
Okay, let's get this coronation over with.

00:45.295 --> 00:47.839
Mop Girl, fetch me my royal stompers.

00:47.922 --> 00:50.258
But what about your glass slippers, ma'am?

00:53.052 --> 00:55.054
Oh, you're so going to die.

00:58.683 --> 01:00.393
[regal horn music playing]

01:03.021 --> 01:08.068
So, now that you're gonna be queen,
does that mean we all move up a notch?

01:08.151 --> 01:11.738
I just thought
since the three of us are kind of an item,

01:11.821 --> 01:15.033
you know, we'd maybe
share the throne? Huh?

01:15.617 --> 01:17.577
Do they have a crown for best friends?

01:17.660 --> 01:19.579
As your new royal assassin,

01:19.662 --> 01:22.082
I can arrange for Elfo
to fall down a flight of stairs

01:22.165 --> 01:24.918
in a comical yet suspicious manner. Ow!

01:25.001 --> 01:26.836
Boys, this is serious.

01:26.920 --> 01:30.632
Being on the throne's
a huge, horrible responsibility.

01:30.715 --> 01:32.967
But if I'm gonna do this,
I gotta do it right.

01:33.051 --> 01:34.385
Yes, of course.

01:34.469 --> 01:37.138
I didn't get an answer
on that best friend crown.

01:37.847 --> 01:40.266
Oh! You showed up. Okay, showtime.

01:49.526 --> 01:50.902
Bean is going to be queen.

01:50.985 --> 01:54.614
And the queen can no longer associate
with those who are beneath her.

01:54.697 --> 01:55.907
You are dismissed.

01:57.075 --> 01:58.326
Did we just get dumped?

01:58.409 --> 02:00.787
I look to you
as the world's foremost authority.

02:00.870 --> 02:03.873
The key to getting dumped
is not knowing how to take a hint.

I'm forced to sit in the back

So, um, just wondering,
in terms of our relationship, how are we?

02:51.921 --> 02:55.592
I still don't like you or your eyeball,
but you have valuable experience.

02:55.675 --> 02:56.843
So we're okay for now.

02:56.926 --> 02:59.178

Queen Tiabeanie, where are you going?

03:42.222 --> 03:44.390
I want to address all my subjects,

Then perhaps you can tell me why,

03:59.614 --> 04:02.867
only a male heir can be crowned,
but now this?

04:02.951 --> 04:06.621
I mean, this kingdom has rules,
and to change them willy-nilly--

04:06.704 --> 04:08.665
Herman, you're leaning out

If you're cheering

I feel like I know
each and every one of you.

I've shopped at your stores
and peed in your fountains.

04:39.904 --> 04:43.408
I've gotten high in your drug dens
and I passed out in your barrels.

to run for your lives

Big Jo? I thought he was dead.
He looks like a cadaver.

No, don't shoot.

06:04.739 --> 06:08.868
Bean, I've had a lot of time to think
since our adventure in Cremorrah,

06:08.951 --> 06:11.829
when you buried me in sand
and left Porky and me for dead.

06:11.913 --> 06:13.831
I came to apologize.

06:13.915 --> 06:15.833
[Bean] Then what's with
the scary green smoke?

06:15.917 --> 06:18.211
Oh, well, that's the pork sausages.

06:18.294 --> 06:20.797
Porky has his own grill
in the back of the wagon

06:20.880 --> 06:25.134
and I toss him a sausage
every ten miles if he runs fast enough.

06:25.218 --> 06:27.720
Some people say
that's why he's named "Porky."

06:27.804 --> 06:29.597
-[Elfo] Is that true?
-No.

06:29.680 --> 06:33.726
And why should we trust you?
Dude, you tried to kill us multiple times.

06:33.810 --> 06:35.436
Even demons think you're a dick.

06:35.520 --> 06:37.688
Perhaps it's because I've spent a lifetime

06:37.772 --> 06:41.192
exorcising other people's demons,
but never my own.

06:41.275 --> 06:44.737
He does seem remorseful.
Maybe he's telling the truth.

06:44.821 --> 06:46.405
What shall we do, Your Majesty?

06:46.489 --> 06:49.242
I don't know,
he still looks kinda evil to me.

06:49.325 --> 06:52.995
That's just my appearance.
I have resting sinister face.

06:53.913 --> 06:56.499
Well, I want this
to be a progressive kingdom,

06:56.582 --> 06:59.669
not one beholden
to superstition and magic.

06:59.752 --> 07:02.255
And these days,
there is a modern way to get to the truth

07:02.338 --> 07:03.923
without having to kill someone.

07:04.006 --> 07:05.174
Throw him in the dungeon!

07:07.260 --> 07:09.470
Hi, you're under arrest.

07:10.638 --> 07:13.808
Boy, this went
a completely different way in my head.

07:15.977 --> 07:17.270
[grunts]

07:21.315 --> 07:26.070
Oh, Big Jo, I've heard so much about
your stoic manner and indomitable spirit.

07:26.154 --> 07:27.738
It'll be an honor breaking them both.

07:27.822 --> 07:30.741
Do what you will to Porky,
but he will never talk.

07:31.409 --> 07:34.370
Stan, I need to speak
with the prisoners alone.

07:34.454 --> 07:37.039
The queen wants me
to press them for information.

07:37.123 --> 07:38.416
Oh, good idea.

07:38.958 --> 07:41.878
I'll just be over here,
pressing this guy for information.

07:42.837 --> 07:44.964
[whimpering and yelping]

07:45.923 --> 07:49.051
We need to talk. Does he have to be here?

07:49.135 --> 07:52.555
Porky, I thought I told you not to
embarrass me with your antics today.

07:52.638 --> 07:54.056
Go sit in a corner.

07:56.184 --> 07:58.269
When I got your message to come here,

07:58.352 --> 08:00.730
you didn't say anything
about being locked in the dungeon.

08:00.813 --> 08:03.858
I had no idea
Bean would be so unforgiving.

08:03.941 --> 08:06.486
Maybe if your disposition
were a little sunnier…

08:06.569 --> 08:11.032
[scoffs] I spit on your sunny disposition.
To important matters.

08:11.115 --> 08:12.909
I thought the dismal end of Zøg

08:12.992 --> 08:16.162
was to be the grand beginning
for our secret society.

08:16.245 --> 08:17.371
Bean gaining the crown

08:17.455 --> 08:20.082
has thrown a Turbish-sized monkey wrench
into the works.

08:20.166 --> 08:22.668
-Who's Turbish?
-The bane of my existence.

08:22.752 --> 08:24.879
-The chubby fellow who escorted you?
-Oh, yes.

08:24.962 --> 08:26.214
Never mind all that.

08:26.297 --> 08:28.633
I called you here
so you could help us out.

08:28.716 --> 08:31.427
Indeed. Fortunately, I may have discovered

08:31.511 --> 08:33.721
a key piece of information
about the Curse.

08:35.097 --> 08:35.973
[grunts]

08:36.891 --> 08:40.228
The page torn from The Book Of Øgs.
You took it?

08:40.311 --> 08:43.105
My branch of the society
has been desperate

08:43.189 --> 08:45.483
for clues to the true meaning
of the Curse.

08:45.566 --> 08:47.401
I collect them when I have the chance.

08:47.485 --> 08:49.904
Porky says he's going
to put a scrapbook together,

08:49.987 --> 08:51.697
but we shall see.

08:51.781 --> 08:53.991
Anyway, check this out.

08:54.075 --> 08:56.577
The ancient language of ancients!

08:56.661 --> 08:57.703
Can you read it?

08:57.787 --> 08:59.622
Only with my ancient glasses.

08:59.705 --> 09:02.667
But I must get back to the queen
before she suspects something.

09:02.750 --> 09:06.045
She's alarmingly more
on top of things than her father.

09:07.421 --> 09:09.048
[babbling]

09:10.925 --> 09:13.970
Hey, couldn't you take a less bumpy road?

09:14.053 --> 09:15.346
Yes, I could.

09:15.429 --> 09:16.889
[Zøg continues babbling]

09:24.981 --> 09:27.358
[Elfo] "Elfo, nothing will tear us apart."

09:27.441 --> 09:28.609
[sighs]

09:28.693 --> 09:31.696
It's the end of an era.
Bean's real royalty now.

09:31.779 --> 09:35.032
And for the first time ever,
she's outta my league.

09:35.700 --> 09:38.202
I guess it's time to finally let you go.

09:38.286 --> 09:40.538
Plus, I couldn't sell you
at the indoor swap meet.

[Elfo] Oh, no, Junior.

me sure me not like.

09:57.263 --> 09:58.306
[whimpers]

10:07.940 --> 10:10.401
Is the new throne
to your liking, Your Majesty?

10:10.484 --> 10:12.528
You do like it, right?
No, you hate it, don't you?

10:12.612 --> 10:14.155
No, well… Try that out, yes.

10:14.238 --> 10:15.531
That's a nice feature, isn't it?

10:15.615 --> 10:18.701
The beer holders are nice, but honestly,

10:18.784 --> 10:21.621
shouldn't we be spending
our time and money on the actual kingdom?

10:21.704 --> 10:25.833
[chuckles] You are so hilarious, Queen.
That was a joke, wasn't it?

10:25.916 --> 10:27.168
[Elfo] Bean! Bean!

10:28.210 --> 10:30.129
Ogres are attacking,
and we're all gonna die.

10:30.212 --> 10:33.174
Also, one of the ogres
destroyed your painting. It wasn't me.

10:33.257 --> 10:34.800
Sound the ogre alarm!

10:34.884 --> 10:37.136
We don't have an ogre alarm, Your Majesty.

10:37.219 --> 10:39.388
We've never been attacked by ogres before.

10:39.472 --> 10:41.182
Just sound any alarm!

10:41.265 --> 10:43.225
-[snaps fingers]
-[bell tolling]

10:43.309 --> 10:47.063
No, not the raccoon alarm.
Just sound all the alarms!

10:47.146 --> 10:49.357
[various bells clanging]

10:49.440 --> 10:55.112
[man shouting] Alarm! Alarm! Alarm! Alarm!

10:55.196 --> 10:58.032
What are we going to do?
We have no king to protect us.

10:58.115 --> 10:59.200
Woah! Woah! Woah!

10:59.283 --> 11:00.284
I'm right here.

11:00.368 --> 11:03.287
He just meant, it'd be better
if we had a man to lead us.

11:03.371 --> 11:05.873
Yeah, I know. Thanks, Bunty.

11:05.956 --> 11:07.083
You're welcome, ma'am.

11:07.166 --> 11:09.585
[whispering] Remember this insult
when the revolution comes.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.837
We could use
your father's never-fail tactic.

11:11.921 --> 11:13.422
Just throw servants over the wall

11:13.506 --> 11:15.841

23:25.529 --> 23:28.281
I don't know why you always
bring out the good half in me, Bean.

[gasps]

23:40.168 --> 23:41.837
No. No, Luci!

23:43.713 --> 23:46.466

Where is this bookcase taking us?

Down, down, down.

23:48.343 --> 23:49.553
Stop saying "down."

23:49.636 --> 23:52.639
All the way down. To your destiny.

Don't push those buttons.
It won't do any good.

24:10.907 --> 24:12.617
This is an express elevator.

Where am I?

24:37.893 --> 24:40.061
[God] Welcome to Heaven, Luci.

24:40.145 --> 24:43.523
