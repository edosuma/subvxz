WEBVTT

00:04.101 --> 00:06.402
Morning.
Morning.

00:06.404 --> 00:09.155
You, by chance, have the number
of a good chiropractor?

00:09.157 --> 00:10.423
What about Alan?

00:10.425 --> 00:14.660
(laughing)

00:15.495 --> 00:18.013
Sorry. I couldn't resist.

00:18.015 --> 00:19.281
What, is your back out?

00:19.283 --> 00:22.201
Not yet, but I got a big date
for Valentine's Day.

00:22.203 --> 00:25.621
And if everything goes well,
I'll need a chiropractor,

00:25.623 --> 00:28.073
a psychiatrist and a priest.

00:28.925 --> 00:30.042
I can't wait for this

00:30.044 --> 00:31.293
stupid holiday
to be over

00:31.295 --> 00:32.762
so we can celebrate
something cool, like...

00:32.764 --> 00:35.765
Free Bobblehead
at Dodger Stadium Day.

00:36.583 --> 00:38.017
What are you
talking about?

00:38.019 --> 00:39.418
Valentine's Day.

00:39.420 --> 00:40.853
Or what it should really
be called:

00:40.855 --> 00:42.754
Dumb Greeting Card,
Chocolate-Covered,

00:42.756 --> 00:45.257
Overpriced Flowers,
Can't Get a Dinner Reservation,

00:45.259 --> 00:48.760
I'm Probably Going
to Die Alone Anyway Day.

00:48.762 --> 00:51.280
Sounds like
Cupid's arrow hit somebody

00:51.282 --> 00:52.581
right in the
the bile sack.

00:52.583 --> 00:55.568
Don't get my started
on that fat, flying baby.

00:55.570 --> 00:57.453
What could you possibly have
against Cupid?

00:57.455 --> 00:59.955
First of all,
he's wearing a diaper.

00:59.957 --> 01:01.874
Yeah, that's sexy.

01:01.876 --> 01:03.275
And then he's got wings,

01:03.277 --> 01:05.777
which make you think of angels,
which makes you think of God,

01:05.779 --> 01:06.879
which makes you feel guilty

01:06.881 --> 01:08.581
about having sex
in the first place.

01:08.583 --> 01:10.666
And in the second place.

01:12.135 --> 01:15.287
Well, I, for one, am going
all out for Lyndsey this year.

01:15.289 --> 01:16.972
Really?
What's that mean?

01:16.974 --> 01:20.092
Cemetery flowers and a coupon
for one free go-around

01:20.094 --> 01:22.478
on Mr. Alan's Wild Ride?

01:22.480 --> 01:23.846
I am sparing no expense.

01:23.848 --> 01:24.930
Lyndsey deserves the best,

01:24.932 --> 01:27.016
and I am finally going
to give it to her.

01:27.018 --> 01:28.517
Well, if you're
giving it to her,

01:28.519 --> 01:30.186
it's not going to be the best.

01:32.606 --> 01:34.806
(cell phone chimes)

01:34.808 --> 01:36.158
Wow.

01:36.160 --> 01:37.193
What?

01:37.195 --> 01:39.795
I just got an e-mail from Kate.

01:39.797 --> 01:41.580
She's in town.
She wants to see me.

01:41.582 --> 01:42.648
Did she say why?

01:42.650 --> 01:44.200
No.

01:44.202 --> 01:46.318
Could be anything.

01:46.320 --> 01:47.819
It could be nothing.

01:47.821 --> 01:49.655
Could be something.

01:49.657 --> 01:51.006
Could be something serious.

01:51.008 --> 01:52.842
What if she's dying?

01:52.844 --> 01:54.477
What if she's pregnant?

01:54.479 --> 01:57.496
Wait, what if she's dying
to be pregnant?

01:57.498 --> 02:00.299
The woman I love
wants to have my child.

02:00.301 --> 02:02.935
Oh, my God,
I'm going to be a father.

02:02.937 --> 02:06.055
Advantage: fat, flying baby.

02:07.524 --> 02:09.692
You have the number
of a good chiropractor?

02:29.002 --> 02:29.685

Sam.

02:30.670 --> 02:32.053
Oh... it's...

02:32.055 --> 02:33.054
I'm kidding.

02:33.056 --> 02:35.223
Oh.
Hi, Walden.

02:35.225 --> 02:37.291
Hi.

02:38.477 --> 02:39.644
Hi.
Hi.

02:39.646 --> 02:41.762
I, uh... I got you
your favorite coffee.

02:41.764 --> 02:42.980
Hey, how'd you remember?

02:42.982 --> 02:44.649
Please, how hard is it
to remember

02:44.651 --> 02:47.652
a grande, extra hot, decaf,
triple shot, five pump

02:47.654 --> 02:51.239
vanilla, nonfat, no foam,
whip cream, caramel macchiato?

02:51.241 --> 02:53.357
Actually, I switched to tea.

02:53.359 --> 02:56.110
Oh.
It's a joke.

02:56.945 --> 03:00.581
Well, you look great.

03:00.583 --> 03:03.034
Success is really
working for you.

03:03.036 --> 03:06.203
Then again, you'd look great
with a bag over your head.

03:06.205 --> 03:09.173
That didn't come off as
charming as I wanted it to.

03:10.008 --> 03:11.459
Thank you.

03:11.461 --> 03:12.927
I can't believe
how lucky I've been.

03:12.929 --> 03:15.930
Lucky? Come on,
you have real talent.

03:15.932 --> 03:18.599
I-I actually bought
one of your dresses

03:18.601 --> 03:20.417
off your Web site.
Seriously?

03:20.419 --> 03:22.053
Yeah, I haven't had
a chance to wear it yet.

03:22.055 --> 03:23.220
(laughs)

03:23.222 --> 03:25.806
I've been waiting
for the perfect occasion.

03:27.609 --> 03:31.195
I was really surprised
that you called me.

03:31.197 --> 03:33.814
Yeah, I'm actually in town
for a couple of days

03:33.816 --> 03:36.617
on business,
and I wanted to see you.

03:36.619 --> 03:38.619
You did?

03:38.621 --> 03:39.870
Me, too.

03:39.872 --> 03:42.123
I mean, other than stalking you
on Facebook.

03:42.958 --> 03:47.078
Well, I wanted
to give you this.

03:47.080 --> 03:49.130
It's the money
you invested in me.

03:50.415 --> 03:51.782
Oh, Kate.

03:51.784 --> 03:53.000
I gave this to my girlfriend

03:53.002 --> 03:54.752
so she could
follow her dreams.

03:54.754 --> 03:56.470
And I am paying back my investor

03:56.472 --> 03:58.422
so I don't owe him anything.

03:58.424 --> 04:01.559
S-So this is why
you wanted to see me.

04:01.561 --> 04:03.561
Walden, we broke up.

04:03.563 --> 04:04.812
When you break up, you give

04:04.814 --> 04:06.097
the other person
their stuff back.

04:06.099 --> 04:08.683
Yes, but it's usually
a cell phone charger

04:08.685 --> 04:10.067
and a bite guard.

04:10.069 --> 04:12.820
Well, in this case,
it's $100,000.

04:12.822 --> 04:13.904
Well, I don't want it.

04:13.906 --> 04:15.656
But I do want
my bite guard back.

04:15.658 --> 04:16.940
Buy another one.

04:16.942 --> 04:18.492
Or 1,000 of them.

04:18.494 --> 04:21.612
Kate, just put the money
into your business.

04:21.613 --> 04:23.698
It'll help you get
to the next level.

04:23.700 --> 04:26.283
I don't need it.

04:26.285 --> 04:27.785
I've actually found
a new investor.

04:27.787 --> 04:29.754
That's how I'm able
to pay you back.

04:30.655 --> 04:33.374
So, we're no longer
business partners.

04:33.376 --> 04:35.376
We are not.

04:36.828 --> 04:38.129
Well, that's great.

04:38.131 --> 04:39.496
That frees us up to be

04:39.498 --> 04:41.682
two young,
crazy dreamers in love.

04:41.684 --> 04:43.000
No.

04:43.002 --> 04:46.670
Okay, how about two
cautiously optimistic adults

04:46.672 --> 04:47.972
sharing dinner?

04:47.974 --> 04:49.390
I don't think
that's a good idea.

04:49.392 --> 04:51.058
Give me one more run at this.

04:51.060 --> 04:52.643
(sighs)

04:52.645 --> 04:56.364
Two old friends,
chance encounter, bus stop,

04:56.366 --> 04:58.065
sharing a bag of tacos.

04:58.067 --> 04:59.784
Not going to happen.

04:59.786 --> 05:01.452
Too bad.

05:01.454 --> 05:04.822
I was really looking for
an excuse to wear my new dress.

05:08.660 --> 05:12.196
Hi. Um, I am interested
in doing something special

05:12.198 --> 05:14.632
for my best gal
on Valentine's Day.

05:14.634 --> 05:18.753
Uh, how much
is your Presidential Suite?

05:20.305 --> 05:21.806
Uh-huh, I-I see.

05:21.808 --> 05:23.507
Um, do you, by any chance,

05:23.509 --> 05:26.043
have a
Secretary of Agriculture Suite?

05:29.064 --> 05:31.348
All right, all right,
you know what, let me just book

05:31.350 --> 05:33.484
your best regular-people room,
and, uh,

05:33.486 --> 05:37.238
would it be possible to, uh,
split the deposit

05:37.240 --> 05:40.557
over three credit cards?

05:40.559 --> 05:42.576
Oh, oh, sure, I'll hold.

05:43.912 --> 05:45.913
Oh, oh, hey,
how'd it go with Kate?

05:45.915 --> 05:49.316
Let's just say she doesn't
want me in her business.

05:49.318 --> 05:51.702
Financial or lady.

05:51.704 --> 05:53.254
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

05:53.256 --> 05:55.189
Yeah, the only reason
she wanted to see me

05:55.191 --> 05:58.092
was to give me this stupid check
for $100,000.

06:02.297 --> 06:05.433
(softly):
You're not stupid to me.

06:07.135 --> 06:08.469
So, uh, what's
the next step?

06:08.471 --> 06:09.937
There is no next step.

06:09.939 --> 06:12.056
It's over.
What are you talking about?

06:12.058 --> 06:14.275
She doesn't want anything
to do with me.

06:14.277 --> 06:15.309
(scoffs)

06:15.311 --> 06:16.444
Well, there's a good attitude.

06:16.446 --> 06:18.062
Let me ask you something.

06:18.064 --> 06:20.314
Was it over for Lyndsey and me

06:20.316 --> 06:22.432
when I burned her house
to the ground?

06:23.602 --> 06:24.601
No.

06:24.603 --> 06:25.870
Was it over for us

06:25.872 --> 06:27.822
when I introduced
her mom to my mom,

06:27.824 --> 06:30.124
who subsequently turned her
into a rapacious lesbian? No.

06:30.126 --> 06:33.127
And-and-and what about
me living in this house?

06:33.129 --> 06:35.496
Was it over when my brother died
and you bought the place?

06:35.498 --> 06:36.797
Sadly, no.

06:36.799 --> 06:39.500
Right, because I am not
a quitter.

06:39.502 --> 06:41.068
And you aren't, either.

06:41.070 --> 06:44.255
You're Walden Schmidt,
captain of industry.

06:44.257 --> 06:46.390
Titan of technology.

06:46.392 --> 06:48.476
Head honcho of...

06:49.811 --> 06:51.679
...handsomeness.

06:51.681 --> 06:52.930
Ran out of steam?

06:52.932 --> 06:56.233
Yes, but you'll notice
I did not quit.

06:57.068 --> 06:58.402
Maybe you're right.

06:58.404 --> 06:59.603
Of course I'm right.

06:59.605 --> 07:02.139
Nothing is over until
you say it's over.

07:02.141 --> 07:04.124
With the possible exception
of me moving out,

07:04.126 --> 07:05.809
which will only happen
when you wheel me

07:05.811 --> 07:07.244
into the assisted
living facility.

07:07.246 --> 07:08.445
You're right.

07:08.447 --> 07:09.780
I'm going to go
talk to her.

07:09.782 --> 07:10.748
Thank you, Alan.

07:10.750 --> 07:12.066
No problem, buddy.

07:12.068 --> 07:14.651
I will always be here for you.

07:15.670 --> 07:17.204
Literally.

07:18.540 --> 07:20.975
Oh, uh, hello.

07:20.977 --> 07:22.176
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:22.178 --> 07:24.828
Um, I have a MasterCard,

07:24.830 --> 07:27.715
a Discover card
and my mom's Visa.

07:34.055 --> 07:35.806
Walden.

07:35.808 --> 07:37.007
Great, you've already showered.

07:37.009 --> 07:38.559
Now, get dressed.
We're going to dinner.

07:38.561 --> 07:40.144
What? No.

07:40.146 --> 07:42.512
(makes buzzer noise)
Sorry, wrong answer.

07:43.365 --> 07:44.982
The head honcho
of handsomeness

07:44.984 --> 07:46.483
rejects your rejection.

07:46.485 --> 07:47.985
Is that a title
you gave yourself?

07:47.987 --> 07:51.572
No, it was given to me
by the man I live with.

07:51.574 --> 07:54.458
(sighs)
How did you find my room?

07:54.460 --> 07:55.692
They told me at the front desk.

07:55.694 --> 07:56.744
They're not supposed to do that.

07:56.746 --> 07:57.912
They're also not supposed

07:57.914 --> 08:00.080
to accept bribes,
but here I am.

08:00.082 --> 08:02.199
I am not going to dinner
with you.

08:02.201 --> 08:04.218
Fine.

08:04.220 --> 08:06.754
You don't want to go to dinner
with me, then...

08:07.756 --> 08:10.925
...then we will have
dinner right here.

08:10.927 --> 08:13.894
Look, your favorite:
a half-eaten lobster

08:13.896 --> 08:15.229
with a
cigarette butt in it.

08:15.231 --> 08:18.098
Oh, I was really hoping
for coleslaw

08:18.100 --> 08:20.234
with a Band-Aid in it.

08:22.737 --> 08:24.822
Come on, Kate,
go to dinner with him.

08:24.824 --> 08:27.408
Don't be so shellfish.

08:27.410 --> 08:28.609
(laughing)

08:28.611 --> 08:30.611
You know you're an idiot, right?

08:30.613 --> 08:32.413
I'm a persistent idiot.

08:32.414 --> 08:33.496
(sighs)

08:33.499 --> 08:34.898
Let me get dressed.

08:37.118 --> 08:38.402
Yay.

08:44.626 --> 08:46.961
Why would I do that?

08:49.681 --> 08:52.683
Oh, hey, there's
my valentine.

08:52.685 --> 08:54.351
Will you be mine?

08:54.353 --> 08:56.253
Hi, Alan.
Yes, I will.

08:56.255 --> 08:57.771
Great, 'cause I got something
special planned.

08:57.773 --> 08:59.273
Is this going to be
another scavenger hunt

08:59.275 --> 09:00.691
that ends in your pants?
Ah...

09:00.693 --> 09:04.028
No, no, this year, I booked us
a room at the Bel-Air Hotel

09:04.030 --> 09:05.779
with the full romance package.

09:05.781 --> 09:07.764
Oh, my God, are you serious?

09:07.766 --> 09:10.100
Oh, yeah, uh,
candlelight dinner, dancing,

09:10.102 --> 09:12.202
couples massage,
followed by savage sex

09:12.204 --> 09:13.603
with the man of your dreams.

09:13.605 --> 09:16.624
Steve Buscemi's
going to be there?

09:16.626 --> 09:17.658
(laughing)

09:17.660 --> 09:18.826
That sounds amazing.

09:18.828 --> 09:20.127
But how can you afford it?

09:20.129 --> 09:21.161
Ah, bup, bup, bup.

09:21.163 --> 09:23.247
Nothing is too good for milady.

09:23.249 --> 09:24.748
Besides, a month
without antidepressants

09:24.750 --> 09:26.133
isn't going to kill me.

09:26.135 --> 09:27.918
I don't know what to say.

09:27.920 --> 09:29.420
Oh, you don't have to say
anything.

09:29.422 --> 09:30.554
Just pack your bag,

09:30.556 --> 09:32.139
and your chariot
will arrive at 6:00.

09:32.141 --> 09:35.059
Yeah, would it be okay
if we took my chariot?

09:35.061 --> 09:36.010
Why?

09:36.012 --> 09:37.678
Really,
I have to say it out loud?

09:38.596 --> 09:39.930
I don't want to pull up

09:39.932 --> 09:42.066
to the Bel-Air Hotel
in your piece-of-crap car.

09:42.068 --> 09:45.152
Oh, oh, uh, we can use your car.

09:45.154 --> 09:47.988
Oh, and if the front desk
refers to you as Evelyn Harper,

09:47.990 --> 09:49.073
just roll with it.

09:49.075 --> 09:50.741
Okay.

09:50.743 --> 09:51.992
Well, I love you.

09:51.994 --> 09:53.744
I love you, too.

09:53.746 --> 09:55.245
Well.

09:55.247 --> 09:56.813
That went well.

09:56.815 --> 10:00.584
I won't be needing these clues
for the scavenger hunt.

10:03.121 --> 10:05.005
Wasn't that better
than sitting in your room

10:05.007 --> 10:07.374
all alone watching porn?

10:08.293 --> 10:09.710
Is that what you do?

10:09.712 --> 10:12.212
What, me? No...

10:12.214 --> 10:13.597
I'm a Bible guy.

10:13.599 --> 10:16.717
(laughing)

10:16.719 --> 10:18.052
Well, thanks.

10:18.054 --> 10:19.770
I had a really nice time.

10:19.772 --> 10:21.055
Me, too.

10:25.560 --> 10:27.027
Well, good night.

10:29.197 --> 10:30.180
Uh, but...

10:30.182 --> 10:32.199
good night?
Yeah.

10:32.201 --> 10:35.152
Oh, I was hoping
that maybe we could...

10:35.154 --> 10:38.072
you know, have hotel fun.

10:38.074 --> 10:40.240
I don't sleep with guys
on the first date.

10:40.242 --> 10:41.408
First date?

10:41.410 --> 10:42.576
We lived together.

10:42.578 --> 10:45.679
No, I lived with Sam Wilson.

10:45.681 --> 10:48.582
Who you bare
an uncanny resemblance to,

10:48.584 --> 10:52.720
but... still, I think
we should take it slow.

10:52.722 --> 10:54.704
Okay, I get it.

10:56.491 --> 10:57.925
Good night.

10:59.000 --> 11:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:07.885 --> 11:09.236
What do you
want, Walden?

11:09.238 --> 11:12.106
Oh, uh... it's not Walden;
it's Sam Wilson.

11:13.258 --> 11:14.575
Go away.

11:14.577 --> 11:16.660
Eh, it was worth a shot.

11:27.713 --> 11:28.896
Morning.

11:28.898 --> 11:30.548
Oh, there he is.

11:30.550 --> 11:31.565
Come here.

11:31.567 --> 11:32.583
What?

11:32.585 --> 11:35.002
Just come here.

11:38.140 --> 11:39.456
Oh!

11:39.458 --> 11:41.726
Oh, what a lovely way
to start the day.

11:43.345 --> 11:44.895
Don't kiss me.
I have morning breath.

11:44.897 --> 11:46.514
Thank you.

11:46.516 --> 11:47.515
You're welcome.

11:47.517 --> 11:48.516
What did I do?

11:48.518 --> 11:49.767
You were right.

11:49.769 --> 11:51.652
Kate and I wound up having

11:51.654 --> 11:52.937
a great time
last night.

11:52.939 --> 11:54.105
Congratulations.

11:54.107 --> 11:55.623
Yeah. It was perfect.

11:55.625 --> 11:57.274
I mean, it was
the same...

11:57.276 --> 11:59.160
chemistry, the same
connection.

11:59.162 --> 12:00.578
Hmm, when you say "connection,"

12:00.580 --> 12:02.146
are we talking
"love connection"?

12:02.148 --> 12:03.497
And by "love connection,"

12:03.499 --> 12:06.584
I mean,
"brown chicken, brown cow."

12:06.586 --> 12:09.003
No.
No?

12:09.005 --> 12:11.155
Nah, I didn't want to.

12:11.157 --> 12:12.823
You know,

12:12.825 --> 12:14.508
I just wanted
to take it slow.

12:14.510 --> 12:17.378
So we could connect on a more
emotional, spiritual level.

12:17.380 --> 12:18.462
Huh.

12:18.464 --> 12:20.497
Sounds pretty gay to me,
but... all right.

12:20.499 --> 12:22.216
So when are you gonna
see her again?

12:22.218 --> 12:23.417
Tonight.
On Valentine's Day?

12:23.419 --> 12:24.518
Yep.

12:24.520 --> 12:26.187
Ooh, that's a terrific day
not to get laid.

12:26.189 --> 12:27.455
I know, right?

12:27.457 --> 12:29.523
Oh, oh, hey, can I ask
your opinion about something?

12:29.525 --> 12:30.658
Yeah, of course.
Great.

12:30.660 --> 12:31.942
What-what do you
think of this?

12:31.944 --> 12:33.511
Whoa! Dude!

12:33.513 --> 12:34.645
What the hell?

12:34.647 --> 12:36.513
Oh, uh, I-I did
a little manscaping

12:36.515 --> 12:39.033
for my, uh... my big night
with Lyndsey tonight.

12:39.035 --> 12:40.317
I wanted to surprise her.

12:40.319 --> 12:42.186
Uh... does this look
like a heart?

12:42.188 --> 12:43.371
Uh...

12:43.373 --> 12:44.905
Yeah, it looks great.
I love it.

12:44.907 --> 12:47.024
You're not even looking.
Come on, I had your back.

12:47.026 --> 12:49.243
Yeah, well, I don't want
to have your front.

12:51.380 --> 12:52.546
Please?

12:52.548 --> 12:54.248
Fine.

12:54.250 --> 12:56.033
But I'm going
to restrict my response

12:56.035 --> 12:57.468
to only the nest.

12:57.470 --> 12:59.003
I'm not going to comment

12:59.005 --> 13:01.305
on the baby bird
sitting on top of the eggs.

13:01.307 --> 13:03.391
That's all I ask.

13:09.097 --> 13:11.098
No.

13:11.100 --> 13:12.433
Doesn't look like a heart.

13:12.435 --> 13:15.052
What? It-it doesn't?

13:15.054 --> 13:16.487
No. There's no...

13:16.489 --> 13:18.388
cleavage, there's no dip.

13:18.390 --> 13:20.224
It's just... there.

13:20.226 --> 13:21.859
Wait, what are you
talking about?

13:21.861 --> 13:23.527
There's a...
there's a curve right there.

13:23.529 --> 13:25.613
The whole thing
is lopsided.

13:25.615 --> 13:27.364
Oh, no. It just looks that way

13:27.366 --> 13:28.666
'cause I haven't fluffed.

13:28.668 --> 13:29.900
See?

13:31.236 --> 13:32.920
No, it still doesn't look
like a heart.

13:32.922 --> 13:35.372
Fine, I'll keep
working on it.

13:35.374 --> 13:37.741
But it is very difficult
to manscape from this angle.

13:37.743 --> 13:39.593
No, it's not.
Uh, yeah, it is.

13:39.595 --> 13:42.713
Okay, just for a
frame of reference...

13:42.715 --> 13:44.181
check out my
manscaping.

13:44.183 --> 13:46.350
Oh, my God.

13:46.352 --> 13:48.352
It's beautiful.
Mm-hmm.

13:49.187 --> 13:51.138
BERTA:
I knew it.

13:51.140 --> 13:53.441
So that's how you pay the rent.

14:00.431 --> 14:02.483
Alan, come on, let's go.

14:02.485 --> 14:06.320
I want to spend every possible
minute in that hotel room.

14:06.322 --> 14:08.155
ALAN: One second!
Just finishing off

14:08.157 --> 14:09.623
one last
Valentine's surp...

14:09.625 --> 14:11.158
(screams)

14:11.160 --> 14:12.376
Alan?

14:13.411 --> 14:14.411
(gasps)

14:14.413 --> 14:16.797
Oh, my God, what happened?

14:16.799 --> 14:17.998
Manscaping...

14:18.000 --> 14:19.917
Balls...

14:19.919 --> 14:21.669
Hospital!

14:25.507 --> 14:26.974
(heavy breathing)

14:26.976 --> 14:29.343
Well, I believe we just
combined Valentine's Day

14:29.345 --> 14:31.562
with the Fourth of July.

14:31.564 --> 14:35.099
What do you say we throw in
Groundhog Day and do it again?

14:35.101 --> 14:37.134
(laughs)

14:37.136 --> 14:38.686
You know...

14:38.688 --> 14:40.738
I had no intention
of sleeping with you.

14:40.740 --> 14:43.023
I even wore my granny panties.

14:43.025 --> 14:44.525
Well, the joke's on you,

14:44.527 --> 14:47.161
'cause I like a sensible,
full-coverage brief.

14:47.163 --> 14:49.029
(laughs)

14:49.031 --> 14:50.865
I really missed you.

14:50.867 --> 14:52.116
Me, too.

14:52.118 --> 14:55.152
Can I tell you a secret, though?
Sure.

14:55.154 --> 14:58.372
Sam Wilson is a much
better lover than you.

15:00.425 --> 15:01.926
I'm sorry.

15:01.928 --> 15:05.045
I couldn't get my mind
off of Alan's penis.

15:05.047 --> 15:06.847
(laughs)

15:11.052 --> 15:12.186
Oh, please drive faster.

15:12.188 --> 15:13.554
I'm bleeding out...

15:13.556 --> 15:14.805
of my scrotum.

15:14.807 --> 15:15.806
(groans)

15:15.808 --> 15:17.691
Where in the world
did you get the idea

15:17.693 --> 15:19.527
to shave your pubic hair
into a heart?

15:19.529 --> 15:21.195
I read about it in a magazine.

15:21.197 --> 15:22.646
What magazine?

15:22.648 --> 15:24.281
<i>Marie Claire.</i>

15:24.283 --> 15:26.350
Doesn't look
much like a heart.

15:26.352 --> 15:28.536
Well, it's bleeding like one.

15:29.371 --> 15:30.454
(siren wails)

15:30.456 --> 15:31.455
Oh...

15:31.457 --> 15:32.706
Oh. Oh, my God.

15:32.708 --> 15:33.690
This is the end.

15:33.692 --> 15:34.691
I'm seeing lights.

15:34.693 --> 15:36.243
You're not dying.

15:36.245 --> 15:37.328
We're getting
pulled over.

15:37.330 --> 15:39.213
Oh, nice job, lead foot.

15:40.916 --> 15:42.366
Do you want to keep
your other ball?

15:43.752 --> 15:44.718
Evening, ma'am.

15:44.720 --> 15:46.036
Do you know why I
pulled you over?

15:46.038 --> 15:47.304
I know I was speeding,

15:47.306 --> 15:48.538
but I have a very good excuse.

15:48.540 --> 15:49.557
Is that so?

15:49.559 --> 15:50.591
Show him, Alan.

15:50.593 --> 15:51.708
What? No!

15:51.710 --> 15:52.726
Show him.

15:52.728 --> 15:54.228
Oh...

15:54.230 --> 15:56.931
Oh, sweet mother of God!

15:58.650 --> 16:00.067
Is that a heart?

16:02.487 --> 16:05.222
Thank you.

16:07.192 --> 16:08.576
(gasps)
Oh, my God!

16:08.578 --> 16:10.527
Wha...? Alan, no.

16:14.399 --> 16:15.950
Sorry. What's...
what's going on?

16:15.952 --> 16:17.234
You're not going
to believe this.

16:17.236 --> 16:20.120
My business partner
just found a factory.

16:20.122 --> 16:22.623
We can start production
on my line immediately.

16:22.625 --> 16:23.874
That's great.

16:23.876 --> 16:25.259
Congratulations.

16:25.261 --> 16:27.544
Oh, my God, this
is so exciting.

16:27.546 --> 16:30.014
We leave for
China tomorrow.

16:30.016 --> 16:31.748
Tomorrow?

16:32.434 --> 16:35.102
Oh, you know what?
Wait...

16:35.104 --> 16:37.688
I'm gonna be in Japan

16:37.690 --> 16:39.807
in two weeks on business.

16:39.809 --> 16:41.225
I could hop over to China.

16:41.227 --> 16:42.726
We could get some
kung pao chicken,

16:42.728 --> 16:44.228
maybe adopt a baby.

16:45.063 --> 16:46.196
Oh...

16:46.198 --> 16:48.315
Kung pao chicken
is such a commitment.

16:49.818 --> 16:51.118
Ah, wait.

16:51.120 --> 16:53.170
In two weeks,
I have to be back here.

16:53.172 --> 16:54.705
Okay.

16:54.707 --> 16:56.373
Oh, how about
the week of the tenth?

16:56.375 --> 16:57.825
I have a tech conference
in Austin.

16:57.827 --> 16:59.126
You could come with me.

16:59.128 --> 17:00.494
Oh. Let me check.

17:00.496 --> 17:02.046
I don't know if you've ever
been to a tech conference,

17:02.048 --> 17:05.049
but picture a comic book
convention with nerdier guys.

17:05.750 --> 17:07.334
You would be their queen.

17:07.336 --> 17:08.785
(laughs)

17:08.787 --> 17:11.422
Ah, no, that
won't work.

17:11.424 --> 17:12.423
Um...

17:12.425 --> 17:13.973
How about first week in May?

17:13.976 --> 17:15.559
I can do the second.

17:15.560 --> 17:17.560
And I can't.

17:19.564 --> 17:22.016
This was a lot easier
when we were both broke.

17:22.018 --> 17:24.018
It was.
(chuckles)

17:24.853 --> 17:26.270
How about this?

17:26.271 --> 17:29.523
Are you free for sex
in 30 seconds?

17:29.525 --> 17:31.742
I have an opening.

17:33.111 --> 17:35.412
Let me check.

17:35.414 --> 17:37.331
Well, I'll
have to move

17:37.333 --> 17:39.166
a few things around,
but yes, I am.

17:39.168 --> 17:40.334
(laughs)

17:44.706 --> 17:45.756
Hi.

17:45.758 --> 17:47.374
Hi.

17:47.376 --> 17:48.375
How you doing?

17:48.377 --> 17:50.127
I'm high,

17:50.129 --> 17:51.962
humiliated and hairless.

17:53.214 --> 17:55.849
I'm sorry I ruined
Valentine's Day.

17:55.851 --> 17:57.051
What are you
talking about?

17:57.053 --> 17:59.669
Well, I wanted it to be special
because, you know,

17:59.671 --> 18:02.222
I haven't always been
the best boyfriend,

18:02.224 --> 18:06.226
or even a good
boyfriend.

18:06.228 --> 18:07.561
Or even an adequate boyfr...

18:07.563 --> 18:08.979
Feel free to stop me

18:08.981 --> 18:10.230
at any time.

18:10.232 --> 18:12.399
I'm just teasing you.

18:12.401 --> 18:14.451
The fact that you even tried
means everything to me.

18:14.453 --> 18:16.686
Really?
Really.

18:16.688 --> 18:19.573
And driving 95 miles an hour
behind a police escort?

18:19.575 --> 18:21.959
Best Valentine's Day ever.

18:24.245 --> 18:25.796
Oh, hey, you know, uh...

18:25.798 --> 18:28.132
we could pull this curtain.

18:28.134 --> 18:29.583
Seriously?

18:29.585 --> 18:31.752
They just put
ten stitches in your junk.

18:31.754 --> 18:35.089
I thought we could take
advantage of the swelling.

18:36.707 --> 18:38.875
Okay.

18:42.430 --> 18:44.064
LYNDSEY:
You ready?

18:44.066 --> 18:45.733
ALAN:
Ow.

18:45.735 --> 18:47.101
Ow, ow.

18:47.103 --> 18:49.653
Ow! Don't-don't stop.

18:49.655 --> 18:51.271
Ow!

18:51.273 --> 18:53.607
(Alan groaning)

19:02.329 --> 19:05.248
I know I'm going to regret
asking this, but...

19:05.250 --> 19:07.500
how's your ball?

19:08.335 --> 19:10.603
Throbbing and green.

19:10.605 --> 19:12.972
So what's going on
with you and Kate?

19:12.974 --> 19:14.507
I don't know.

19:14.509 --> 19:16.393
It's going to be hard
to make a relationship work

19:16.395 --> 19:17.844
with her traveling
all around the world.

19:17.846 --> 19:19.612
Mmm, that's rough.

19:19.614 --> 19:24.184
Not "tetanus shot
in your sack" rough, but...

19:24.186 --> 19:25.935
Hey, how's she
affording all this?

19:25.937 --> 19:27.954
She's got some new investor
with a lot of money.

19:27.956 --> 19:29.489
Oh, that's nice.

19:29.491 --> 19:32.992
Yeah, except I don't know if I'm
ever gonna see her again.

19:32.994 --> 19:35.829
If you don't leave it
alone, it'll never heal.

19:37.198 --> 19:38.531
If you don't
stop doing that,

19:38.533 --> 19:40.784
I'm gonna make you
wear a cone around it.

19:44.071 --> 19:47.040
What a stroke of luck, you
finding that factory in China.

19:47.042 --> 19:48.508
ROSE:
I know.

19:51.745 --> 19:55.131
Sometimes fate steps in
and makes things happen.

19:55.133 --> 19:58.218
I'm not gonna lie--
I wish the timing were better.

19:58.220 --> 20:01.638
Well, if he really loves you,
he'll wait for you.

20:02.440 --> 20:04.224
How did you know
I have a boyfriend?

20:04.226 --> 20:06.309
Oh, a pretty girl like you?

20:06.311 --> 20:08.194
You'd have to have a boyfriend.

20:08.196 --> 20:09.612
He's amazing.

20:09.614 --> 20:11.064
I'm crazy about him.

20:11.066 --> 20:12.431
Been there.
