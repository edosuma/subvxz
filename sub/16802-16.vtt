00:03.003 --> 00:04.796
Amy: Previously on "Heartland."

00:04.838 --> 00:07.215
- I figure you know about me
and Lou.

00:07.257 --> 00:10.468
- I don't want to,
but yeah, I do.

00:10.510 --> 00:12.804
- Sweating bullets thinking
about telling you today.

00:12.846 --> 00:15.181
- Well, don't sweat bullets
on my account,

00:15.223 --> 00:16.725
save that for Tim.

00:18.935 --> 00:22.564
- Just wish Adam trusted me,
but... he didn't.

00:24.190 --> 00:26.776
- Why? What do you mean?

00:26.818 --> 00:29.738
- He read my texts
and now I can never trust him.

00:33.074 --> 00:35.744
- Dude, you are burning up.
- I just need some sleep.

00:37.370 --> 00:39.247
I'll feel better when
I get some rest.

00:43.335 --> 00:44.502
(Sheep bleat)

00:51.217 --> 00:53.094
(Grunt efforts)

00:53.136 --> 00:55.305
- What's the first thing you're
gonna do when you get back?

00:55.347 --> 00:56.848
I'm dreaming of a tall,
cold brewskie

00:56.890 --> 00:58.683
and a long, hot shower.

00:58.725 --> 01:01.436
- Oh.

01:01.478 --> 01:03.521
(Distorted sounds)

01:03.563 --> 01:05.774
(Tired exhale)

01:05.815 --> 01:08.360
- Ooh.
- You okay?

01:08.401 --> 01:10.278
- Yeah-yeah, I'm fine.
- You sure?

01:10.320 --> 01:11.529
(Distorted sounds)

01:11.571 --> 01:13.615
- Argh.

01:13.656 --> 01:15.784
Bob: Hey! Get up.

01:15.825 --> 01:19.537
- Yeah-yeah, I'm...
I'm okay, man.

01:19.579 --> 01:21.373
(Falling grunts)

01:23.249 --> 01:25.126
(Birds chirp)

01:31.508 --> 01:32.759
(Blankets rustle)

01:35.553 --> 01:37.138
(Happy sigh)

01:44.354 --> 01:46.648
(Music plays and computer beeps)

01:48.400 --> 02:02.497
**

02:05.041 --> 02:07.752
- Well, look what the cat
dragged in.

02:07.794 --> 02:09.378
- (Chuckles) Hey, Jack.

02:09.420 --> 02:12.382
- You're here early.
What you miss it that much?

02:12.424 --> 02:14.050
- No, the winter hay
for the trail horses

02:14.092 --> 02:15.301
gets in this morning,

02:15.343 --> 02:17.554
so I thought I'd get an early
jump on these chores.

02:17.595 --> 02:21.641
- It's good to have you back.
How did you like New York?

02:21.683 --> 02:24.477
- Uh, I gotta say I'm not
entirely sold on the place.

02:24.519 --> 02:27.147
- Yeah? No argument here,

02:27.188 --> 02:29.524
I don't care much
for the big cities,

02:29.566 --> 02:31.401
or traveling at all
for that matter.

02:31.443 --> 02:33.486
The only reason I do it,
is Lisa.

02:33.528 --> 02:35.113
- Well, I gotta say if I had
to be in New York,

02:35.155 --> 02:37.824
it was pretty great
to be there with Lou.

02:37.866 --> 02:40.618
Tim: What?!

02:40.660 --> 02:43.455
What were you doing
in New York with Lou?

02:48.460 --> 02:51.338
**

02:51.379 --> 02:53.631
(Crow caws)

02:53.673 --> 02:55.550
(Car rumbles up)

03:04.726 --> 03:07.395
(Paint splatters,
Horses whinny)

03:09.814 --> 03:11.858
(Horses whinny)

03:11.900 --> 03:14.652
(Paint splatters)

03:14.694 --> 03:16.071
Boy: Go, go, go.

03:16.112 --> 03:17.781
Jack: Hold it right there!

03:17.822 --> 03:19.616
Mitch: Hey stop!

03:19.657 --> 03:21.743
(Engine roars, tires screech)

03:24.454 --> 03:25.663
(Boys laughing)

03:27.123 --> 03:29.417
(Remy barks)

03:35.840 --> 03:45.850
**

03:45.850 --> 03:51.231
**

03:51.272 --> 03:55.610
* And at the end of day
you sank into your dream *

03:58.613 --> 04:00.490
* You dreamer *

04:00.532 --> 04:02.742
* Oh, oh, oh, oh *

04:02.784 --> 04:04.953
* You dreamer *

04:06.788 --> 04:10.291
* You dreamer *

04:16.798 --> 04:18.925
Georgie: Come on, Remy.
Jack: Whao! Whoa!

04:18.966 --> 04:21.177
(Remy barks)

04:21.219 --> 04:23.930
Whoa! What's going on?

04:23.972 --> 04:25.849
- I'm not sure.
- Here.

04:25.890 --> 04:28.268
Where's Phoenix?
Amy: Dad!

04:28.309 --> 04:30.103
- Amy, you stay back.
- No, just let me get Spartan.

04:30.145 --> 04:31.980
- There no telling what
these horses might do.

04:32.022 --> 04:35.066
- I promise I'll be careful.
Georgie: Phoenix.

04:35.108 --> 04:37.110
Phoenix is covered in paint,
or something?

04:37.152 --> 04:39.029
Tim: Easy, easy, easy.
- Easy, Phoenix.

04:39.070 --> 04:41.740
- Georgie, just be careful!

04:41.781 --> 04:43.324
- Phoenix!

04:46.119 --> 04:48.496
Wait! Come back!

04:48.538 --> 04:49.706
Jack: Phoenix!

04:49.748 --> 04:52.959
Tim: Easy. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:53.001 --> 04:54.753
(Nervous exhales)

04:57.047 --> 04:58.840
- (Grimaces)
- Oh, boy.

04:59.883 --> 05:01.676
Fun stuff.

05:01.718 --> 05:03.011
- What?

05:03.053 --> 05:05.430
- Well...

05:05.472 --> 05:07.098
looks like you got a visitor.

05:07.140 --> 05:08.558
- What's that for?

05:08.600 --> 05:09.934
- Looks like it's still
in there.

05:09.976 --> 05:11.019
- What?

05:11.061 --> 05:13.438
- Hold on.

05:16.149 --> 05:19.569
Come on.

05:19.611 --> 05:22.447
- (Pained exhale)
- Yeah!

05:22.489 --> 05:25.700
Got it.

05:25.742 --> 05:27.994
- Is that a tick?
- Yeah, I'd say so.

05:28.036 --> 05:30.372
- We got it. Good.

05:34.626 --> 05:35.752
- (Relieved exhale)

05:35.794 --> 05:38.129
- I have to go now before
Phoenix gets too far!

05:38.171 --> 05:40.256
- We're doing this the right
way. I'm going with you.

05:40.298 --> 05:41.883
End of story.
- Grandpa's right.

05:41.925 --> 05:42.967
I'll help you get the horses
tacked up.

05:43.009 --> 05:44.803
Georgie: Come on, Trouble.
- Yeah. Okay, good.

05:44.844 --> 05:47.263
Yeah, somebody will be here.
Yeah, thank you.

05:47.305 --> 05:49.557
All right. Okay. The police
are sending someone

05:49.599 --> 05:50.767
over to take a statement.

05:50.809 --> 05:52.102
- Do you guys want me to ride
out with you, Jack?

05:52.143 --> 05:53.937
- Naw, everything's under
control.

05:53.978 --> 05:56.189
I doubt Phoenix got far.
You go deal with that hay.

05:56.231 --> 05:57.774
- The hay?

05:57.816 --> 05:59.609
Some idiot just took pot shot
at our horses?

05:59.651 --> 06:01.820
- I'm aware of that.
- Well, I feel like

06:01.861 --> 06:02.946
I should go and try to find
the punks who did it.

06:02.987 --> 06:05.198
- Well, I think you should let
the police handle it.

06:05.240 --> 06:06.658
- All right, I-I gotta stack
and cover this hay

06:06.700 --> 06:07.992
before it rains tonight.

06:08.034 --> 06:09.994
- Tim, maybe you can
give him a hand?

06:10.036 --> 06:12.831
- Oh, uh, No. I got it.

06:12.872 --> 06:15.000
- Oh, You got it?
Oh, you don't need my help?

06:15.041 --> 06:17.168
(Laughs) No-no, I'll help you.

06:17.210 --> 06:19.421
Yeah, give us a chance to talk.

06:19.462 --> 06:21.840
Keep us in the loop, Jack.
All right, let's go.

06:23.717 --> 06:26.928
- Yeah. I'll get over there
as soon as I can.

06:31.725 --> 06:34.769
- Easy. Trouble, you're fine.

06:34.811 --> 06:36.896
- I'm not sure taking him
is such a good idea, Georgie.

06:36.938 --> 06:38.189
- I know,
but he's Phoenix's buddy.

06:38.231 --> 06:40.650
Maybe it'll help lure him to us.

06:40.692 --> 06:42.527
- It's just, he was out there
in the middle of all this

06:42.569 --> 06:44.279
and he's still pretty spooky.

06:44.320 --> 06:46.281
- The police are on their way.

06:46.322 --> 06:48.324
Georgie, you ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready.

06:48.366 --> 06:50.702
It's okay.
- Just be careful, okay?

06:50.744 --> 06:51.828
I'll be here.
- All right.

06:51.870 --> 06:53.705
All right, come on, Trouble,
let's find Phoenix.

06:53.747 --> 06:55.874
(Hooves clop)

06:55.915 --> 06:57.584
(Worried sigh)

06:59.878 --> 07:01.629
(Doors shut)

07:03.131 --> 07:05.842
- Look, Tim, Lou and I planning
on telling you about us.

07:05.884 --> 07:07.761
- I'm not surprised.

07:07.802 --> 07:09.554
You've been playing
that angle from the start.

07:09.596 --> 07:11.014
- That's not true.

07:11.056 --> 07:12.349
Yeah, we had a thing
for each other,

07:12.390 --> 07:13.892
but we tried to ignore it
for a long time.

07:13.933 --> 07:16.102
- Yeah. Not long enough.

07:20.315 --> 07:25.111
Agh.

07:25.153 --> 07:28.740
(Engine sputters)

07:28.782 --> 07:30.492
- Ah, I don't' get it,

07:31.785 --> 07:33.453
it was working fine yesterday.

07:33.495 --> 07:36.915
- Let me take look at it.
(Engine sputters)

07:39.250 --> 07:41.670
Try it.

07:41.711 --> 07:43.672
(Engine sputters)

07:44.964 --> 07:46.758
Try it again.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.176
(Engine sputters)

07:48.218 --> 07:49.678
Okay, okay! Whoa!

07:49.719 --> 07:52.722
It's the alternator.
- What?

07:52.764 --> 07:54.683
- Jack should have replaced it
months ago.

07:54.724 --> 07:56.351
- Perfect.

07:56.393 --> 07:58.937
I wanted to use the bucket
to lift up the bales.

07:58.978 --> 08:00.271
- Well, that's not gonna happen.

08:00.313 --> 08:02.065
So what's your contingency plan?

08:02.107 --> 08:05.402
- I didn't expect I'd need one.

08:05.443 --> 08:08.571
- Mitch, life on a ranch
is unpredictable.

08:08.613 --> 08:11.825
You gotta have a back up plan
for worst case scenarios.

08:11.866 --> 08:13.201
Kind of like when your daughter
is dating a ranch hand...

08:13.243 --> 08:14.953
with no real prospects...

08:14.994 --> 08:17.038
- Perfect. Here we go.

08:17.080 --> 08:18.415
- We're gonna have to do it
by hand.

08:18.456 --> 08:20.291
You afraid to break a sweat?

08:20.333 --> 08:22.961
No. (Stutters)
- Good. Good.

08:23.003 --> 08:24.045
Let's go.

08:25.171 --> 08:27.549
- (sighs) Great.

08:28.425 --> 08:30.176
Georgie: Phoenix!

08:31.428 --> 08:33.304
What if we can't find him?

08:33.346 --> 08:36.850
- It'll be okay.
Phoenix knows his way home.

08:36.890 --> 08:39.227
- What if he doesn't wanna
come back?

08:39.269 --> 08:43.148
- Why wouldn't he wanna come
back? You're here.

08:43.188 --> 08:45.859
- I haven't been paying much
attention to him lately.

08:45.900 --> 08:47.610
Mallory jumped him
when she was here.

08:47.652 --> 08:50.447
I just keep remembering how
much we used to do together.

08:50.488 --> 08:54.242
- Phoenix is well cared for.
He seems plenty happy to me.

08:56.202 --> 08:57.912
You sure that's what
you're worried about?

08:57.954 --> 09:00.123
This wouldn't have something
to do with Adam,

09:00.165 --> 09:02.792
now would it?

09:02.834 --> 09:05.086
- I ah... I ended things
with him.

09:05.128 --> 09:07.297
- Yeah, I figured.

09:07.339 --> 09:10.008
I haven't seen him
around lately.

09:12.010 --> 09:14.137
- I'm kind of regretting it
though.

09:14.179 --> 09:16.473
I'm really missing him.

09:16.514 --> 09:19.851
I was gonna talk to him at
the reserve about everything.

09:19.893 --> 09:22.771
- That's good.
It's good to be upfront,

09:24.272 --> 09:27.734
Keep in mind there's no telling
how things will end up.

09:30.820 --> 09:32.614
(Tuck rumbles up)

09:36.034 --> 09:36.951
(Remy barks)

09:40.372 --> 09:42.374
(Engine shuts off, keys jingle)

09:42.415 --> 09:44.125
- Hey.

09:44.167 --> 09:45.919
- Hi, there. Can I help you?

09:45.960 --> 09:48.129
- Yeah. I hope so.

09:48.171 --> 09:51.257
I'm uh, Claire. Claire Wallace.

09:51.299 --> 09:53.426
Are you Amy Fleming?
- I am.

09:53.468 --> 09:55.303
- Great. Yeah. I was just
passing through Hudson...

09:55.345 --> 09:57.097
I stopped there for a coffee
and heard

09:57.138 --> 09:59.516
all about your amazing
work with horses.

09:59.557 --> 10:02.268
But obviously one important
detail was left out!

10:02.310 --> 10:04.896
I'm sorry. I never would have
stopped by if I'd know.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.356
- Oh, it's okay, I'm still
working with client horses

10:06.398 --> 10:08.358
I'm just not riding
at the moment

10:08.400 --> 10:11.111
But today isn't really
a great day.

10:11.152 --> 10:13.113
- Sorry, to drop in on you
like this.

10:13.154 --> 10:14.906
I should've called first.

10:14.948 --> 10:17.242
I'm just not sure what
to do with my horse,

10:17.283 --> 10:20.078
and I'm only in the area
for today so...

10:20.120 --> 10:22.831
- Well, you're already here...

10:22.872 --> 10:24.791
I might as well take a look.
- Yeah?

10:24.833 --> 10:26.835
- Yeah.
Great.

10:28.461 --> 10:29.838
- Is he a Canadian breed horse?

10:29.879 --> 10:31.923
- Yeah, he is actually.

10:31.965 --> 10:35.051
His official name
is Shady Lane King Shamrock

10:35.093 --> 10:36.761
believe it or not,
but I just call him Shamrock.

10:36.803 --> 10:38.638
- Wow, he is beautiful.

10:38.680 --> 10:40.390
I've never worked with
a Canadian before.

10:40.432 --> 10:42.684
- Oh yeah?
Shamrock is my mother's horse.

10:43.435 --> 10:46.896
Well, he was her horse...
she uh,

10:46.938 --> 10:48.481
she passed a couple
of months ago.

10:48.523 --> 10:50.483
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Thanks.

10:50.525 --> 10:55.113
Yeah. My mom was passionate
about promoting the breed.

10:55.155 --> 10:56.614
Actually, that's why I'm here.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.908
She was planning to compete
in the versatile horse

10:58.950 --> 11:00.493
and rider competition in
Springfield next month.

11:00.535 --> 11:01.703
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

11:01.745 --> 11:03.997
That's all she talked about
those last weeks.

11:04.039 --> 11:06.166
So I want to compete on
Shamrock, for her.

11:06.207 --> 11:07.751
He's great at navigating
most obstacles,

11:07.792 --> 11:10.920
I'm just having trouble getting
him to back up on command.

11:10.962 --> 11:13.006
- Okay, why don't you
just show me?

11:13.048 --> 11:14.257
- Okay. Yeah. Sure.

11:14.299 --> 11:15.884
Do you mind grabbing a bridle?

11:15.925 --> 11:17.260
They're just inside
the trailer door.

11:17.302 --> 11:20.013
- Sure.
- So do you own this place?

11:20.055 --> 11:22.265
- My grandfather does?
- Yeah?

11:22.307 --> 11:25.060
What's his name?
- Jack Bartlett.

11:29.647 --> 11:32.067
- You find them?
- Yeah...

11:35.904 --> 11:39.407
Here you are.
- Okay.

11:43.244 --> 11:44.746
- (Sighs)

11:47.332 --> 11:54.172
**

11:54.214 --> 11:56.091
- C'mon. Whao!

11:57.384 --> 11:59.094
Okay.

11:59.135 --> 12:00.804
C'mon, Shamrock.

12:00.845 --> 12:01.971
Back it up.

12:02.013 --> 12:03.139
Back it up.

12:03.181 --> 12:04.808
Back. Whoa!

12:04.849 --> 12:06.267
Back it up.

12:06.309 --> 12:09.396
Whoa! Whoa.

12:09.437 --> 12:11.272
That's exactly what
happens every time.

12:11.314 --> 12:13.149
He has trouble reining back
at first,

12:13.191 --> 12:14.651
and then he goes all crooked
when he does.

12:14.693 --> 12:17.404
- Okay. I think I can help.

12:17.445 --> 12:19.030
- Why don't' we start
from the ground first.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.281
- Sure.

12:21.700 --> 12:25.203
So uh, who did you say
recommended me in Hudson?

12:25.245 --> 12:27.163
I just, I like to thank them.

12:27.205 --> 12:31.543
- Ah... you know, I didn't
catch the name actually.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.503
Should we get started?

12:33.545 --> 12:35.964
- Yeah. If you don't mind
I'm gonna work with him first.

12:36.006 --> 12:39.092
And I'll just start him out
backwards.

12:39.134 --> 12:42.345
And it looks like
he has a tendency

12:42.387 --> 12:44.556
to drift off to the right.
- Yeah.

12:44.597 --> 12:46.558
- See there. He's just wanting
to head over there.

12:46.599 --> 12:49.269
So when you're on his back,
(clicks tongue)

12:49.310 --> 12:51.312
you're gonna have to use that
leg to keep him over.

12:51.354 --> 12:54.315
Right now I'll use the end
of this whip.

12:54.357 --> 12:56.568
Apply a little bit of pressure

12:56.609 --> 12:59.487
to get him going back that way.

12:59.529 --> 13:01.614
And then you can release
the pressure

13:01.656 --> 13:03.992
when you need him to turn.

13:04.034 --> 13:05.368
And then you might need
to switch,

13:05.410 --> 13:08.246
you might need to some pressure
on with this leg.

13:08.288 --> 13:10.707
You just feel what he is doing.
- Right.

13:10.749 --> 13:13.043
- And correct as he goes.
- Well, that's already better.

13:13.084 --> 13:15.337
- There we go. Good boy.

13:15.378 --> 13:16.629
I like to do this a few more
times from the ground

13:16.671 --> 13:18.548
and then we can try it
in the saddle.

13:18.590 --> 13:20.884
- Okay, sounds good.
Maybe I should try.

13:20.925 --> 13:22.385
- Actually,

13:22.427 --> 13:25.388
I need to cut to the chase...

13:25.430 --> 13:28.933
I saw the article in your
trailer about my grandfather.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.020
I don't know what's going on?

13:32.062 --> 13:35.065
But are you here because of
your horse or because of him?

13:35.106 --> 13:38.193
- Look, the truth is...

13:40.445 --> 13:43.281
my mother knew Jack...
years ago.

13:43.323 --> 13:46.284
And actually I knew him too,
when I was a kid.

13:46.326 --> 13:48.119
- Why didn't you just say that?

13:48.161 --> 13:49.746
- I don't know.

13:49.788 --> 13:52.165
I-I should have. I'm sorry.

13:53.708 --> 13:57.170
It's just, I've got some
pretty private business

13:57.212 --> 13:59.464
to discuss with him Jack
on behalf of my mother.

14:01.174 --> 14:03.426
But my problem with Shamrock
is legit.

14:03.468 --> 14:05.095
I do wanna compete with him
next month,

14:05.136 --> 14:07.055
An I need your help.

14:11.142 --> 14:13.228
- There's grandpa now.

14:15.146 --> 14:17.148
(Hooves thud)

14:17.190 --> 14:19.192
(Tack jingles)

14:20.402 --> 14:22.028
- (Sighs)

14:23.405 --> 14:24.864
- Yeah, you know,
Lou's the whole package.

14:24.906 --> 14:28.284
She is smart, she's ambitious,
she's a great mother.

14:28.326 --> 14:31.371
- Yeah, she's an amazing woman.

14:31.413 --> 14:33.498
- And you really see yourself
fitting in into that picture?

14:34.708 --> 14:36.209
- What's that supposed to mean?

14:36.251 --> 14:37.919
- I know what Jack pays you.

14:37.961 --> 14:40.380
You're living in a rundown,
borrowed trailer.

14:40.422 --> 14:43.633
You think that's gonna be good
enough for Lou and her girls?

14:43.675 --> 14:45.635
- You know, I don't plan on
being a ranch hand forever...

14:45.677 --> 14:48.763
right?
- Really?

14:48.805 --> 14:52.225
Well, actions speak louder
than words.

14:55.311 --> 14:56.813
- No luck?

14:56.855 --> 14:58.815
- I think we should still
be out there looking.

14:58.857 --> 15:02.068
You know what? Phoenix will
find his way home.

15:02.110 --> 15:03.570
- You sound just like Jack.

15:03.611 --> 15:05.697
Grandpa,
this is Claire Wallace.

15:05.739 --> 15:08.283
She thinks you two
may have met before.

15:09.993 --> 15:12.412
- No. I don't think so.
- Well, I'm not surprised

15:12.454 --> 15:14.581
you don't recognize me,
Mr. Bartlett.

15:14.622 --> 15:19.044
I probably haven't seen you
since I was eight years old.

15:19.085 --> 15:22.047
And I don't go by Nash anymore.

15:22.088 --> 15:24.841
- Claire? Little Claire?

15:24.883 --> 15:26.801
You're Gil and Paula's girl?

15:26.843 --> 15:29.471
- Yeah. It's been a long time.

15:29.512 --> 15:31.431
- Yeah. It's ah...

15:33.725 --> 15:35.560
how is Paula doing?

15:37.312 --> 15:40.440
- Mom passed a couple of months
ago actually.

15:42.859 --> 15:45.153
- I'm-I'm sorry to hear that.

15:46.446 --> 15:49.157
Your mother,
she was a fine woman.

15:51.201 --> 15:53.953
- Thank you. Yeah.

15:53.995 --> 15:56.706
Listen, I...I'm wondering
if I might be able

15:56.748 --> 15:58.667
to talk to you for a couple
of minutes.

15:58.708 --> 16:01.252
- Oh, sure. By all means.

16:01.294 --> 16:03.546
Just come on up to the house?

16:03.588 --> 16:06.174
- Great. I just need to grab
something out of my trailer.

16:14.599 --> 16:16.768
Bob: Look, man, you're in
no condition to travel.

16:16.810 --> 16:19.354
- I'm okay. I just need
to get back to Amy,

16:19.396 --> 16:21.314
and I'll be fine.

16:21.356 --> 16:23.483
- I get that,
but you should hold up,

16:23.525 --> 16:24.901
and reschedule and leave
in a day or two.

16:24.943 --> 16:26.444
- Bob, I can't miss this
flight, okay?

16:26.486 --> 16:28.363
She could have the baby
at any time.

16:28.405 --> 16:30.365
(Grunts)

16:30.407 --> 16:32.033
Let's go.

16:33.535 --> 16:37.122
Bob... you gotta do this
for me, okay? Please.

16:37.163 --> 16:39.499
I gotta make it home.

16:40.875 --> 16:42.544
(Footsteps crunch)

16:46.339 --> 16:48.717
Just for the record?
This is nuts.

16:48.758 --> 16:52.178
(Engine starts,
jeep rumbles away)

16:57.017 --> 16:59.602
- Yeah. We grew up together,
your dad and I.

16:59.644 --> 17:03.148
- Really? Wow, I did not
know that.

17:03.189 --> 17:04.983
- (Small chuckle)

17:05.025 --> 17:06.818
- You know, after his accident,

17:06.859 --> 17:09.279
Mom didn't talk
about him very much.

17:09.319 --> 17:10.864
I think it was too painful
for her.

17:10.905 --> 17:13.742
- Well, it was a...
a terrible tragedy.

17:15.492 --> 17:17.162
- Yeah. She didn't have
anything to do with the rodeo

17:17.203 --> 17:19.414
after he died.

17:19.455 --> 17:21.624
- We can't really blame her
for that.

17:21.665 --> 17:25.127
- She packed up, moved to
Montana and never looked back.

17:25.170 --> 17:26.546
- Oh.

17:28.464 --> 17:31.343
- She did talk about you
from time to time though.

17:31.384 --> 17:32.719
- Oh.

17:32.761 --> 17:36.556
- But I guess that makes
sense...

17:38.475 --> 17:41.394
since you two stayed in touch.

17:43.521 --> 17:45.607
- I'm not sure what that means.

17:50.528 --> 17:53.782
- My Mom recorded everything.

17:53.823 --> 17:55.784
It's all documented here.
All...

17:57.285 --> 17:59.871
all the... payments.

17:59.913 --> 18:01.873
- Well, It wasn't much.

18:01.915 --> 18:04.376
Like I said,
Gil was an old friend.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.711
- Right. Well...

18:06.753 --> 18:08.588
I'm handling my Moms affairs,

18:08.630 --> 18:12.217
and she wanted you
to have this.

18:12.258 --> 18:14.552
- What's this?

18:14.594 --> 18:17.389
- It's repayment for all your...

18:17.430 --> 18:18.932
all your support.

18:18.973 --> 18:20.809
- I never asked for that.

18:25.563 --> 18:27.148
- Sorry to interrupt.

18:28.316 --> 18:30.610
The Constable is here, grandpa.
- Okay.

18:33.405 --> 18:35.907
It is good to see you, Claire,

18:35.949 --> 18:39.661
but I won't be changing my mind.

18:42.288 --> 18:44.290
Amy: Is everything all right?

18:44.332 --> 18:46.167
- Yeah. It's fine.

18:50.630 --> 18:53.174
- So? Shall we get back at it?

18:54.926 --> 18:56.594
- Yeah.
- Okay.

19:02.934 --> 19:05.478
- So there's nothing
you can do?

19:05.520 --> 19:07.689
- It sounds like it was
a couple of young punks

19:07.731 --> 19:09.733
out for a joyride.

19:09.774 --> 19:12.402
Chances are they won't be back.
- That may be so,

19:12.444 --> 19:15.321
but you are gonna try
to track them down, right?

19:15.363 --> 19:17.699
- I mean, they did shoot
at our horses.

19:17.741 --> 19:20.368
- Well, luckily, it was just
a paintball gun.

19:20.410 --> 19:22.704
It could have been worse.

19:22.746 --> 19:25.165
Any chance somebody
has a grudge against you?

19:25.206 --> 19:29.044
- You think someone might
have targeted us?

19:29.085 --> 19:31.421
I'm pretty sure
that's not the case.

19:31.463 --> 19:33.757
- Yeah. I'll file a report.

19:33.798 --> 19:35.884
Not a lot to go on,

19:35.925 --> 19:39.846
but it will be given
the appropriate attention.

19:39.888 --> 19:42.223
I'll be in touch
if anything turns up.

19:43.808 --> 19:45.352
- Thank you.

19:46.895 --> 19:49.481
- So, basically, he's not gonna
do anything.

19:49.522 --> 19:51.941
- It'll be all right.

19:51.983 --> 19:57.530
**

19:57.572 --> 19:59.949
Adam: Hey, I was just about to
head to the reserve. What's up?

19:59.991 --> 20:02.827
- I just called Scott to tell
him I can't make it.

20:02.869 --> 20:04.496
- Is everything okay?

20:04.537 --> 20:07.499
- Well, someone shot Phoenix
with a paintball gun!

20:07.540 --> 20:08.875
The police were just here,

20:08.917 --> 20:11.419
but they're not taking it
seriously.

20:12.837 --> 20:14.839
Could you maybe talk
to your dad?

20:14.881 --> 20:17.842
- Yeah. Tell me what happened.

20:18.802 --> 20:20.720
- What did the police say?

20:20.762 --> 20:22.681
- (Chuckles) Well...

20:22.722 --> 20:26.726
I'm not sure we're a top
priority for them right now.

20:28.645 --> 20:31.856
- Grandpa? What's going on
with Claire?

20:31.898 --> 20:34.442
How do you know her
and her mother?

20:34.484 --> 20:36.861
And was that a cheque?

20:36.903 --> 20:39.531
- It's not up for discussion,
Amy.

20:40.740 --> 20:42.450
Sometimes it's better
if the past

20:42.492 --> 20:44.536
just stays where it belongs.

20:44.577 --> 20:46.579
(Phone rings)

20:48.248 --> 20:51.292
Yeah. That's your dad.
I better fill him in.

20:51.334 --> 20:52.961
Hey, Tim.

20:54.546 --> 20:56.965
Yeah, the police just left.

20:57.007 --> 20:59.634
- Yeah. Okay, Jack,
I'll check in with you later.

20:59.676 --> 21:01.636
All right.

21:01.678 --> 21:03.763
Phoenix still isn't back.

21:03.805 --> 21:06.057
I think I better ride out
see if I can find him

21:06.099 --> 21:08.852
when we're done here.

21:08.893 --> 21:10.687
- You know, this would all
go a lot faster,

21:10.729 --> 21:12.772
if you actually just pitched in.

21:12.814 --> 21:14.983
- You're lucky I'm helping you
at all.

21:17.694 --> 21:19.988
- You know who's not afraid
of hard work?

21:20.030 --> 21:23.033
- No. But I'm pretty sure
you're gonna tell me.

21:23.074 --> 21:25.952
- Peter.

21:25.994 --> 21:28.163
Sure, he's away from home
a little too much,

21:28.204 --> 21:30.040
but that's because he's got
a big job,

21:30.081 --> 21:32.500
he earns big bucks.

21:32.542 --> 21:35.503
He's a provider,
he's a good father.

21:35.545 --> 21:37.547
- When did you become such
a big fan of Peter?

21:37.589 --> 21:39.174
- What do you know about it?

21:39.215 --> 21:40.759
- Only what Lou tells me.

21:40.800 --> 21:42.761
Sounds like you never liked
the guy.

21:42.802 --> 21:44.596
Isn't that why you call him
The General?

21:44.637 --> 21:47.265
- That's none of your business.
- You sure about that?

21:47.307 --> 21:49.184
'Cause it sounds to me
like a classic case

21:49.225 --> 21:51.061
of a father never thinking
anyone is good enough

21:51.102 --> 21:53.480
for his daughter. Isn't that
what you really think?

21:53.521 --> 21:56.149
- You know what I really
think...

21:56.191 --> 21:58.068
I think it's time for somebody
to get up here.

21:58.109 --> 21:59.694
So I'm guessing that's gonna
be you.

21:59.736 --> 22:02.572
You gonna volunteer,
cause it's a easier job.

22:02.614 --> 22:04.532
- Not a chance.

22:04.574 --> 22:07.869
Besides it's kinda the old
guy's job, isn't it?

22:11.831 --> 22:13.041
(Grunts)

22:15.502 --> 22:19.047
(Knock on door)

22:19.089 --> 22:21.091
- (Sighs)

22:21.132 --> 22:23.968
(Door opens)

22:24.010 --> 22:26.054
What're you doing here?

22:28.139 --> 22:30.558
- My dad said he'll check
into it.

22:30.600 --> 22:33.395
I don't know...
I just thought...

22:37.857 --> 22:40.068
- (Crying) Thank you.

22:44.823 --> 22:47.033
- Go back. Back.

22:51.204 --> 22:52.956
Back.

22:52.997 --> 22:54.416
Okay. Whoa.

22:54.457 --> 22:55.834
Good job.

22:55.875 --> 22:57.794
He's starting to get it.

22:57.836 --> 23:00.505
- Claire, I need to know
what's going on

23:00.547 --> 23:02.424
between you and grandpa?

23:04.134 --> 23:06.928
- I-I don't think I should say.

23:06.970 --> 23:09.055
- Then, I think you need to
leave.

23:11.808 --> 23:14.936
- Look, Amy,

23:14.978 --> 23:16.688
I wish I could clear
things up for you,

23:16.730 --> 23:19.816
but I'm sure I've got as many
questions as you do.

23:19.858 --> 23:24.029
- Okay. Then why don't you
start with what you know.

23:24.070 --> 23:26.072
- Okay. Uh...

23:27.824 --> 23:30.952
I remember Jack was around
quite a bit when I was kid.

23:32.245 --> 23:35.165
I remember him as a nice man.

23:35.206 --> 23:38.084
And my mom talked about him
quite a bit over the years.

23:38.126 --> 23:39.919
I never thought anything
of it...

23:39.961 --> 23:44.132
until recently when I found out
that he'd sent us money.

23:45.633 --> 23:48.178
- Grandpa sent money?
- Yeah.

23:48.219 --> 23:51.765
- It was never a lot at once,
but he sent it for years.

23:51.806 --> 23:55.185
Really helped mom...
the whole family.

23:55.226 --> 23:58.229
There was some really though
times after my dad died.

23:58.271 --> 24:01.358
And I just wanted to say
thank you, pay him back,

24:01.399 --> 24:03.360
but I seem to have touched
a sore point.

24:03.401 --> 24:05.695
- Yeah. Well, grandpa is
a pretty private person.

24:05.737 --> 24:09.866
- Yeah. I get that, but...
who does that?

24:09.908 --> 24:12.118
Who sends money, for years?

24:12.160 --> 24:14.162
Unless they're more than
just a friend.

24:15.288 --> 24:17.499
- What are you saying?

24:18.917 --> 24:21.753
- I think Jack is my father.

24:30.345 --> 24:31.763
- I wouldn't have known
about any of it,

24:31.805 --> 24:34.391
if it wasn't for mom's notebook.

24:34.432 --> 24:36.184
- Notebook?
- Yeah.

24:37.936 --> 24:41.856
After my mom passed,
I found it and read it.

24:41.898 --> 24:43.400
I felt guilty about it at first,

24:43.441 --> 24:45.860
but it just made me feel
really close to her.

24:45.902 --> 24:47.779
Anyway my Mom wrote
everything down.

24:47.821 --> 24:49.781
Every bill and mortgage payment,

24:49.823 --> 24:51.491
and all the money
that Jack had sent.

24:51.533 --> 24:53.868
That's how this whole thing
got started.

24:55.453 --> 24:57.956
Probably sounds crazy to you,
huh?

24:57.997 --> 25:00.750
- No, actually it doesn't.

25:00.792 --> 25:04.796
- Look, Amy, I don't wanna
cause any trouble.

25:04.838 --> 25:06.381
And I knew coming here
after all these years

25:06.423 --> 25:08.508
was probably nuts, but...

25:10.260 --> 25:13.054
I just need to know
if Jack is my father.

25:16.057 --> 25:18.685
(Keys clack)

25:18.727 --> 25:20.395
- I'm gonna post this on social
media

25:20.437 --> 25:21.980
to help get the word out.

25:22.022 --> 25:24.566
- Why didn't I think of that?
You're amazing.

25:27.152 --> 25:30.613
I've been missing
hanging out with you.

25:30.655 --> 25:32.073
- You have?

25:32.115 --> 25:34.117
- Big time.

25:34.159 --> 25:36.995
- Yeah. Me too.

25:37.037 --> 25:38.079
- (Happy sigh)

25:38.121 --> 25:41.374
- (Effort grunts)

25:41.416 --> 25:42.917
- You know, I'm only sticking
my oar in

25:42.959 --> 25:46.921
because Lou is obviously not
thinking clearly.

25:49.257 --> 25:52.010
I have my granddaughters
to worry about.

25:52.052 --> 25:54.346
You're just a good time guy
here for all the fun,

25:54.387 --> 25:56.181
but when the going gets tough
you'll be gone.

25:56.222 --> 25:58.141
- That's not true, Tim.

25:58.183 --> 26:00.060
- You don't fool me.

26:00.101 --> 26:02.979
I know all about it
because I lived it.

26:03.021 --> 26:04.481
And I let it ruin my family.

26:04.522 --> 26:06.358
And I'm not gonna let Lou
get hurt again.

26:06.399 --> 26:08.276
Not that way. Not ever.

26:08.318 --> 26:11.112
No. No. you don't fool me.

26:11.154 --> 26:12.906
You're that guy.

26:12.947 --> 26:16.201
- Okay, we're done.

26:16.242 --> 26:18.411
You can tarp it yourself.

26:18.453 --> 26:21.247
- And there it is.

26:21.289 --> 26:24.042
That's what I'm talking about.
You see?

26:25.293 --> 26:27.796
I got your number, buddy.

26:30.882 --> 26:32.425
- Okay, dad. Thanks.

26:32.467 --> 26:35.970
(Beeps phone off)
- So?

26:36.012 --> 26:38.348
- Other horses have been
hit with paintballs,

26:38.390 --> 26:41.184
so you weren't singled out.
Dad's got a couple of leads.

26:41.226 --> 26:43.770
- Thanks, I don't know what
I'd do without you.

26:46.231 --> 26:50.026
I've been wanting to talk to
you about everything and I...

26:50.068 --> 26:52.987
(Phone chimes)

26:54.364 --> 26:56.491
Someone spotted Phoenix!
They saw the post!

26:56.533 --> 26:58.535
I gotta go!
- Can I tag along?

26:58.576 --> 27:00.662
- Yeah! That'd be great!

27:04.249 --> 27:06.543
(Ty coughing violently)

27:06.584 --> 27:09.045
- You're in bad shape, man.

27:09.087 --> 27:11.423
- I gotta get home.

27:11.464 --> 27:13.383
I gotta get home.

27:13.425 --> 27:16.094
- You can't get on a plane
like this. They won't let you.

27:16.136 --> 27:17.929
- (Pained grunt)

27:17.971 --> 27:20.765
- Your head still killing you?

27:20.807 --> 27:23.810
I can do this.

27:23.852 --> 27:25.311
(Cleansing breath)

27:25.353 --> 27:27.647
(Coughing violently)

27:36.322 --> 27:38.241
- W-we're going back.

27:38.283 --> 27:40.910
- No, come on!
Bob, please... man.

27:40.952 --> 27:42.537
- Look, I'm sorry,
but you're getting worse.

27:42.579 --> 27:44.956
This is not happening.

27:44.998 --> 27:46.374
- (Pained grunt)

27:46.416 --> 27:48.376
(Jeep rumbles)

28:00.764 --> 28:03.725
- I appreciate you looking
into it personally, Jim.

28:05.060 --> 28:08.313
Yeah. Thanks for the call.

28:08.355 --> 28:10.148
Adam's father.

28:10.190 --> 28:12.901
They got 'em.
Teenagers from out of town.

28:12.942 --> 28:15.320
- Well, that's good news.

28:15.362 --> 28:17.322
I saw Georgie and Adam
ride off just now.

28:17.364 --> 28:19.991
- Yeah, she said that
she'd be right back

28:20.033 --> 28:21.910
if Phoenix wasn't there so...

28:24.162 --> 28:28.166
- Grandpa? I don't-
I don't mean to pry,

28:28.208 --> 28:31.336
but you've been acting off ever
since Claire got here and...

28:33.004 --> 28:34.881
Well, she told me
about the money.

28:37.008 --> 28:39.094
See Claire has,
she has a theory.

28:40.220 --> 28:43.306
- Mhm.

28:43.348 --> 28:45.433
And what would that be?

28:47.477 --> 28:50.188
- I can handle it,

28:50.230 --> 28:54.651
if it's the truth, I can.

28:54.693 --> 28:57.445
Are you her father?

29:04.202 --> 29:08.039
**

29:08.081 --> 29:10.166
Claire: Jack?

29:10.208 --> 29:12.544
Hey. Amy says you wanted
to speak with me?

29:12.585 --> 29:14.671
- Yeah.

29:14.713 --> 29:16.297
- I'll just be in the barn
if you need me.

29:16.339 --> 29:18.591
- No, you should stay, Amy.

29:18.633 --> 29:21.511
You need to hear this too.

29:21.553 --> 29:25.140
- Listen, before you say
anything I just...

29:25.181 --> 29:27.225
- Have a seat.

29:28.810 --> 29:31.896
- I wanna say that it might
seem crazy

29:33.565 --> 29:34.941
that I've come here

29:34.983 --> 29:37.527
and I probably shouldn't even
be bringing it up this up,

29:37.569 --> 29:40.405
but I just can't stop thinking
about it,

29:40.447 --> 29:42.157
and I need to know the truth--

29:42.198 --> 29:44.909
- I am not your father, Claire.

29:48.288 --> 29:50.248
-(Sad exhale)

29:52.834 --> 29:55.003
But then I don't,
I don't understand.

29:55.045 --> 29:57.005
- Well, it's like I said,

29:58.256 --> 30:01.343
your dad and I go way back.

30:01.384 --> 30:04.346
We spent years on the rodeo
circuit.

30:07.307 --> 30:09.517
We had some great times
your dad and me.

30:12.103 --> 30:14.105
But your mom,
she finally had enough.

30:14.147 --> 30:16.399
She wanted Gil to quit.

30:16.441 --> 30:18.610
- Mom said dad refused
to quit the rodeo.

30:18.651 --> 30:21.363
- No. No, he talked about it
a lot.

30:23.114 --> 30:25.742
Said we should both think
about quitting.

30:25.784 --> 30:27.535
Get back to ranching.

30:28.953 --> 30:31.998
And then...

30:32.040 --> 30:33.958
he hit a hot streak.

30:35.377 --> 30:37.337
He went on a ran
that set him up to be

30:37.379 --> 30:40.840
the top money winner that year,
which meant a big bonus.

30:44.302 --> 30:46.388
But there was this bronc...

30:48.306 --> 30:51.059
Well, he was a pretty good ride
most of the time.

30:52.435 --> 30:55.230
Every once in a while he'd,
he'd throw himself over.

30:57.607 --> 31:00.568
He was dangerous.

31:00.610 --> 31:02.987
Plenty of guys got injured
on him.

31:05.699 --> 31:09.536
At the next rodeo, I drew him.

31:12.372 --> 31:15.417
I didn't think it was worth
the risk, so I passed.

31:17.168 --> 31:20.380
And the horse goes back
in the draw as a re-ride.

31:22.799 --> 31:25.468
And wouldn't you know it,

31:25.510 --> 31:28.179
Gil pulled his name.

31:30.390 --> 31:32.934
I told him,
he should take a pass too.

31:34.644 --> 31:37.105
But the thought of that bonus
is pretty tempting.

31:38.732 --> 31:42.610
He knew if he won, that cash
would help set your family up

31:42.652 --> 31:45.363
for the long road.

31:46.656 --> 31:49.367
So Gil came out...

31:52.412 --> 31:55.123
and that horse threw
himself over...

31:56.291 --> 31:59.294
right on top of Gil.

32:01.796 --> 32:04.632
It happened quick.
He didn't suffer.

32:11.222 --> 32:13.099
- So that's why you sent
the money.

32:13.141 --> 32:15.268
- Well...

32:15.310 --> 32:17.729
I felt like I had to take care
of his family.

32:17.771 --> 32:20.398
No, I wanted to.

32:22.734 --> 32:25.070
If I didn't pass on that
bronc...

32:27.238 --> 32:30.408
- It's not your fault, Jack.

32:30.450 --> 32:33.328
- No. Maybe not,

32:34.788 --> 32:38.583
but if I rode that horse
that day...

32:38.625 --> 32:41.336
It might have turned out
different, I'll never know.

32:46.132 --> 32:48.093
What I do know?

32:49.386 --> 32:52.722
Is that if the tables
were turned,

32:52.764 --> 32:55.517
your dad would have done
the same thing for my family.

33:01.106 --> 33:03.650
That's you.

33:13.868 --> 33:16.121
- Thanks for coming out
and helping me with all this.

33:16.162 --> 33:18.289
- No problem.

33:18.331 --> 33:20.542
- You know, I've been meaning
to talk to you

33:20.583 --> 33:23.461
about you know... us.

33:25.296 --> 33:27.924
I was ticked off about
the texts but I--

33:27.966 --> 33:30.427
- I shouldn't have read them.
I'm really sorry.

33:30.468 --> 33:32.679
- It's okay. I know.

33:34.347 --> 33:37.559
I've been thinking a lot
about everything and...

33:38.852 --> 33:40.729
could we maybe start over?

33:42.272 --> 33:43.398
- What do you mean?

33:43.440 --> 33:46.151
Like get back together.

33:47.485 --> 33:48.695
- I...

33:50.530 --> 33:52.741
I read that romantic rejection

33:52.782 --> 33:57.328
can activate the same neural
pathways as physical pain.

33:57.370 --> 33:59.414
Which I think it's true.

33:59.456 --> 34:01.166
So no, I can't...

34:02.959 --> 34:05.003
at least not now.

34:05.045 --> 34:07.505
It's not like I don't like you
or anything.

34:07.547 --> 34:09.257
I still do. A lot.

34:10.884 --> 34:13.469
I'm just not ready to go
right back to where we were.

34:13.511 --> 34:21.393
**

34:23.521 --> 34:24.981
- Okay. So you wanna make sure
you keep your body

34:25.023 --> 34:27.900
centered on the horse and
equal pressure on both sides.

34:27.942 --> 34:30.527
- Okay. Okay, let's do this.

34:30.570 --> 34:33.197
Come on, boy. Come on.

34:34.491 --> 34:35.784
(Hooves plot)

34:35.824 --> 34:38.536
- That's it. That's it.

34:38.578 --> 34:40.496
And as you come around
that corner,

34:40.538 --> 34:43.625
you wanna use that left leg
to guide him.

34:43.667 --> 34:45.543
That's it.

34:45.585 --> 34:47.629
There you go.

34:49.839 --> 34:52.384
(Small laugh)

34:52.425 --> 34:54.594
Good job.

34:54.636 --> 34:56.346
You guys are a great team.

34:56.388 --> 34:57.847
(Claire laughs)

34:57.889 --> 35:00.225
- Good work, you two.

35:00.266 --> 35:02.310
- Good fella, Shamrock.

35:02.352 --> 35:03.812
- You're such a good boy.

35:03.853 --> 35:05.814
(Shamrock snorts)

35:07.899 --> 35:11.319
- So if we're not gonna be...
you know...

35:11.361 --> 35:13.321
then what are we?

35:14.739 --> 35:16.908
- Well, we're friends,
aren't we?

35:16.950 --> 35:18.827
- Yeah. Yeah, friends.

35:20.286 --> 35:21.996
(Phoenix whinnies)

35:22.038 --> 35:24.332
My gosh, look. There he is!

35:25.458 --> 35:27.669
Okay.

35:27.711 --> 35:30.422
All right, Trouble, come on!

35:30.463 --> 35:31.506
(Clicks tongue)

35:31.548 --> 35:33.341
Good boy.

35:33.383 --> 35:34.843
Good boy, Trouble.

35:34.884 --> 35:37.470
(Water splashes)

35:37.512 --> 35:38.847
Good boy.

35:39.973 --> 35:41.891
(Trouble snorts)

35:41.933 --> 35:43.852
Hey Phoenix.

35:43.893 --> 35:45.854
Look, it's Trouble.

35:45.895 --> 35:48.398
Good boys.

35:48.440 --> 35:55.864
**

35:55.905 --> 35:57.824
Good boy.

35:59.701 --> 36:01.036
Good boy.

36:01.077 --> 36:03.455
Come on, Phoenix,
Let's get you home.

36:03.496 --> 36:04.831
(Tarp rustles)

36:16.760 --> 36:18.720
- Oh, you come back?
- Here.

36:23.641 --> 36:25.518
- Look, Tim, I know that
you don't like me.

36:25.560 --> 36:27.896
But you shouldn't make
the mistake of thinking

36:27.937 --> 36:30.482
you know me.
Because you don't.

36:33.401 --> 36:34.736
- I don't need to.

36:34.778 --> 36:36.905
I know guys like you.

36:39.032 --> 36:41.076
I was a guy like you.

36:41.117 --> 36:42.994
That's what scares me.

36:43.036 --> 36:45.747
- Look, despite what you think,

36:45.789 --> 36:48.875
I don't run away from problems.

36:48.917 --> 36:51.753
Yeah, I'm, I'm not perfect.

36:51.795 --> 36:54.255
And I-I don't know what's
gonna happen down the road,

36:55.674 --> 36:58.593
but nothing's gonna pull me
away from Lou right now...

36:58.635 --> 37:00.720
Not even you.

37:00.762 --> 37:02.514
Look, I get that you blame
yourself

37:02.555 --> 37:05.850
for ruining your family.

37:05.892 --> 37:09.020
But it's not what I see.

37:09.062 --> 37:13.525
As hard as it must have been,
you, you came back.

37:13.566 --> 37:15.944
(Laughs) Probably out of sheer
stubbornness.

37:18.697 --> 37:20.281
You're part of your daughters'
lives.

37:21.825 --> 37:23.952
And I know how much
it means to them.

37:23.993 --> 37:26.454
How much it means to Lou.

37:26.496 --> 37:27.956
- Yeah, all right.

37:30.417 --> 37:32.544
Trooper.

37:32.585 --> 37:33.962
- (Heavy sigh)

37:35.213 --> 37:37.048
- You still got work to do.

37:37.090 --> 37:38.717
Let's get this tarp on.

37:38.758 --> 37:41.594
- Right. Right.

37:43.680 --> 37:44.931
(Tarp rustles)

37:46.016 --> 37:47.934
(Latch clangs)

37:51.062 --> 37:52.981
- Thanks, Amy.

37:54.858 --> 37:56.401
You have quite the
granddaughter here.

37:56.443 --> 37:57.944
- I won't argue that.

37:57.986 --> 37:59.779
- (Small chuckles)

37:59.821 --> 38:03.116
I did kind of use Shamrock
as an excuse to get here,

38:03.158 --> 38:06.202
but Amy really helped me
with him.

38:06.244 --> 38:09.247
And now we're gonna compete
next month for mom.

38:09.289 --> 38:12.250
- I'm glad it all worked out.

38:12.292 --> 38:15.295
- And I am sorry for dropping
in on you like this.

38:15.337 --> 38:18.590
You know, I came here
looking for a father,

38:18.631 --> 38:21.885
only to find out
I had one all along.

38:21.926 --> 38:23.762
- He couldn't be there
for you growing up,

38:23.803 --> 38:25.889
but he was a good man.

38:25.930 --> 38:27.599
He loved his family.

38:27.640 --> 38:30.685
And I know he'd be real
proud of you.

38:36.566 --> 38:38.526
- Thank you, Jack.

38:42.614 --> 38:44.532
You sure you don't
want that money?

38:46.326 --> 38:48.119
- Seeing how you turned out,
Claire,

38:48.161 --> 38:50.705
that's all the payment I need.

38:53.208 --> 38:56.628
- You take care.
- You too.

38:58.171 --> 39:00.131
(Door opens and shuts)

39:00.173 --> 39:02.801
(Engine roars)

39:05.679 --> 39:07.389
- I love you, grandpa.

39:15.522 --> 39:17.607
(Snorts)

39:17.649 --> 39:20.151
- There you go.
Good boy. Easy.

39:20.193 --> 39:22.153
I know.

39:22.195 --> 39:23.905
- It looks like Adam
saved the day.

39:23.947 --> 39:26.408
- He sure did.

39:27.617 --> 39:29.911
- Well, Phoenix looks
to be okay.

39:29.953 --> 39:31.830
But I wanna get him checked
out, just to be sure.

39:31.871 --> 39:33.623
- Maybe Ty can do it?

39:33.665 --> 39:35.709
- It's cool that he'll
be back tomorrow.

39:35.750 --> 39:38.294
- Yeah. Yeah, I haven't even
planned anything.

39:38.336 --> 39:40.005
I should get on that?

39:40.046 --> 39:41.965
- He doesn't want a big party.

39:42.007 --> 39:44.092
I'm sure Ty just wants
to see you and the baby.

39:46.678 --> 39:48.847
Did he call yet or...?

39:48.888 --> 39:50.682
- No. Not yet.

39:50.724 --> 39:52.434
I'm sure he will
on his layover.

39:53.852 --> 39:56.438
Thanks for your help, Adam.

39:58.189 --> 39:59.190
(Water sloshes)

39:59.232 --> 40:02.110
- Amy is right.
You've been a great friend.

40:04.362 --> 40:07.073
- Well, I should get going.

40:07.115 --> 40:09.826
Maybe lunch at Maggie's
tomorrow?

40:09.868 --> 40:11.619
- You sure?
- Positive.

40:12.871 --> 40:14.706
Hanging out, having lunch...

40:14.748 --> 40:16.666
that's what friends do, right?

40:16.708 --> 40:23.798
**

40:23.840 --> 40:25.884
(Truck rumbles up)

40:32.265 --> 40:33.933
(Doors open and shut)

40:37.896 --> 40:39.189
Tim: Well, thanks for joining
us, Jack.

40:39.230 --> 40:40.857
We're killing ourselves
over there.

40:40.899 --> 40:42.692
- What happened to you guys?

40:42.734 --> 40:44.361
- There's something wrong with
alternator on the tractor

40:44.402 --> 40:46.112
so we had to lift
all the bales by hand.

40:46.154 --> 40:48.615
- There's nothing wrong
with that alternator.

40:48.656 --> 40:51.076
- I-I don't know.
(Nervous chuckle)

40:51.117 --> 40:53.411
Woop. Oh there is-that...

40:53.453 --> 40:56.831
that's the fuse I think,
must have fallen out.

40:58.917 --> 41:01.378
- He sabotaged the tractor?

41:01.419 --> 41:03.254
What kind of nutjob does
something like that?

41:03.296 --> 41:06.007
- I may have done the very
same thing to Tim

41:06.049 --> 41:08.802
when he was dating Marion.

41:08.843 --> 41:11.721
You know, to see
if he was good enough.

41:11.763 --> 41:14.933
Well, the good news is,
it looks like you passed.

41:14.974 --> 41:16.893
- Oh, I don't know about that.

41:16.935 --> 41:18.937
He's got a nickname for me now,
just like Peter.

41:18.978 --> 41:20.647
Calls me Trooper.

41:21.856 --> 41:23.775
- (Chuckles) You sure he said
Trooper?

41:23.817 --> 41:26.111
- Yeah. I heard it enough today.
Why?

41:26.152 --> 41:29.155
- Trooper was this mean old
bronc,

41:29.197 --> 41:32.283
used to be on the circuit
Tim rode him lots of times.

41:32.325 --> 41:34.828
- Oh, great.
- Here is the thing...

41:34.869 --> 41:37.330
Tim respected that horse.

41:37.372 --> 41:41.042
Said he was tough,
said he never gave up...

41:43.294 --> 41:45.672
Sure hated him, though.

41:50.510 --> 41:52.512
- Yeah, it's just a small
welcome home dinner.

41:52.554 --> 41:54.723
But I would love it
if you and Caleb could come?

41:54.764 --> 41:56.433
(Calling music playing)

41:56.474 --> 41:57.642
Oh. Cass, can I call you
right back.

41:57.684 --> 41:59.185
I think Ty is calling!

41:59.227 --> 42:00.979
Okay, bye.
(Beeps phone off)

42:01.021 --> 42:02.897
(Happy exhale)

42:05.817 --> 42:07.986
Bob, hey...

42:08.028 --> 42:10.196
- Hey, Amy...

42:10.238 --> 42:12.490
- What's going on?
Where is Ty?

42:12.532 --> 42:16.119
- Well, Ty is a little sick
and he missed his flight.

42:16.161 --> 42:17.996
- Ohmigod, how sick?

42:18.038 --> 42:19.748
What is it? Where is he?

42:19.789 --> 42:21.124
- Well, he's just lying down
right now.

42:21.166 --> 42:22.751
I'm not sure what he's got.

42:22.792 --> 42:24.377
- What do you mean?

42:24.419 --> 42:26.254
- Well, just that he hasn't
been feeling great

42:26.296 --> 42:28.214
for a couple of days now so...

42:28.256 --> 42:30.383
- He seemed fine the last time
I talked with him.

42:30.425 --> 42:32.802
- Well, yeah.
He was kind of faking it.

42:32.844 --> 42:34.888
He didn't want you to worry.

42:34.929 --> 42:36.973
- I need to see him.

42:37.015 --> 42:38.725
- (Reluctant exhale)

42:39.934 --> 42:41.436
I don't think that's
such a good idea...

42:41.478 --> 42:44.022
Just, just because
he's finally asleep.

42:44.064 --> 42:46.107
- Bob...

42:46.149 --> 42:47.859
- It's okay, Amy.
Don't worry it.

42:47.901 --> 42:49.444
I'm taking care of him.

42:49.486 --> 42:52.280
And I'll have him on a plane
as soon as I can.

42:52.322 --> 42:53.948
I promise.

42:53.990 --> 42:55.533
- Yeah.

42:55.575 --> 42:58.370
- Look, I'll keep you posted,
okay?

42:58.411 --> 42:59.788
- (Emotional sigh)

43:01.039 --> 43:02.665
(Computer beeps off)

43:02.707 --> 43:05.126
(Emotional exhales)

43:05.168 --> 43:07.796
* If the air gets
hard to breath *

43:11.174 --> 43:12.801
* I won't fall to pieces *

43:15.178 --> 43:16.763
(Ty grunts)
- Hey...

43:18.056 --> 43:21.309
Right here, buddy.
Hang in there.

43:21.351 --> 43:23.353
- Okay.

43:23.395 --> 43:27.065
**

43:27.107 --> 43:28.358
(Pained grunts)

43:28.400 --> 43:34.322
