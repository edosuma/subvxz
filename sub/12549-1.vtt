WEBVTT

00:09.740 --> 00:11.612
I'M WORRIED ABOUT DANNY.

00:11.612 --> 00:15.146
HE'S BEEN ACTING
SO STRANGE LATELY.

00:15.146 --> 00:17.017
PROBABLY MORE
FAMILY STUFF.

00:20.291 --> 00:21.622
Lacey:
DON'T STRESS, JO.

00:21.622 --> 00:22.753
IT'S DANNY.

00:22.753 --> 00:24.425
IF SOMETHING WAS
REALLY BOTHERING HIM

00:24.425 --> 00:25.626
HE'D TELL US.

00:25.626 --> 00:27.398
YEAH, I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:27.398 --> 00:30.101
I KNOW.
I'M ALWAYS RIGHT.

00:30.101 --> 00:31.062
YOU WISH.

00:31.062 --> 00:33.164
( both chuckle )

00:33.164 --> 00:35.266
DUDE.

00:35.266 --> 00:36.737
WHAT WAS THAT?

00:36.737 --> 00:39.070
DANNY?

00:39.070 --> 00:40.671
ARE YOU OKAY?

00:43.614 --> 00:45.576
WHY WERE YOU INSIDE
FOR SO LONG?

00:45.576 --> 00:48.279
I HAD TO.

00:48.279 --> 00:49.550
I DIDN'T HAVE A CHOICE.

00:52.823 --> 00:54.755
PLEASE...

00:54.755 --> 00:55.756
DON'T HATE ME.

01:06.097 --> 01:07.298
( gasps )

01:09.640 --> 01:11.102
( sighs )

01:11.102 --> 01:13.104
Tess:
JO, BREAKFAST IS READY.

01:13.104 --> 01:16.277
Reporter:
Desai's return to
Green Grove High

01:16.277 --> 01:18.279
has been met with
controversy.

01:18.279 --> 01:22.183
He was released yesterday from
the juvenile detention facility

01:22.183 --> 01:24.615
that has held him for
the past five years

01:24.615 --> 01:26.287
since he strangled his aunt,

01:26.287 --> 01:28.289
author Tara Desai,

01:28.289 --> 01:30.821
while she babysat
for him and two friends.

01:30.821 --> 01:33.364
The school board's decision
just last week

01:33.364 --> 01:34.625
to readmit Desai
as a sophomore--

01:34.625 --> 01:36.297
CAN WE TURN THAT
OFF NOW, PLEASE?

01:38.299 --> 01:39.630
MOM.

01:39.630 --> 01:41.632
THIS IS MY NEW REALITY.
I MIGHT AS WELL GET USED TO IT.

01:41.632 --> 01:42.833
I JUST THINK YOU'LL
FEEL LESS TENSE

01:42.833 --> 01:44.435
IF YOU TRY NOT TO
FOCUS ON IT.

01:44.435 --> 01:46.777
I'LL FEEL LESS TENSE
ONCE I SEE THAT LUNATIC FREAK

01:46.777 --> 01:48.108
AND TELL HIM
I HATE HIS GUTS.

01:49.780 --> 01:51.312
JO,

01:51.312 --> 01:53.113
YOUR DAD AND I
HAVE BEEN TALKING

01:53.113 --> 01:55.746
AND... WELL?

01:55.746 --> 01:59.119
WE THINK YOU SHOULD START
SEEING DR. SHIN AGAIN.

01:59.119 --> 02:01.492
HELL NO.
THAT GUY SMELLS
LIKE CAT FOOD.

02:01.492 --> 02:03.294
WHICH IS WHY
WE CAN AFFORD HIM.

02:03.294 --> 02:04.355
THIS IS A LOT
TO HANDLE.

02:04.355 --> 02:05.856
MOM, I'M FINE.

02:05.856 --> 02:07.298
FINE?

02:07.298 --> 02:08.759
YOU'RE ABOUT TO
GO YELL AT

02:08.759 --> 02:10.431
A CONFESSED
UNREPENTANT MURDERER.

02:10.431 --> 02:11.862
KYLE, LET'S NOT BE DRAMATIC.

02:11.862 --> 02:13.734
HE WAS A SCARED KID.
SHOULD HE REALLY BE
CONDEMNED

02:13.734 --> 02:15.266
FOR THE REST
OF HIS LIFE?

02:15.266 --> 02:16.837
I NEVER SAID THAT.
I JUST WANT OUR
DAUGHTER TO BE SAFE.

02:16.837 --> 02:18.309
AND THAT'S NOT
WHAT I WANT?

02:18.309 --> 02:20.311
MAYBE YOU TWO SHOULD
GO SEE DR. SHIN.

02:20.311 --> 02:21.642
EAT YOUR EGGS.

02:21.642 --> 02:23.314
Reporter:
Moving on hasn't been easy.

02:23.314 --> 02:24.845
Lacey:
That moment I first saw her

02:24.845 --> 02:26.347
just lying there,

02:26.347 --> 02:27.778
it's etched in my brain.

02:27.778 --> 02:29.580
I don't like
thinking about that day.

02:29.580 --> 02:32.723
And if it were my choice,

02:32.723 --> 02:35.326
I wouldn't let that socio
anywhere near my school.

02:35.326 --> 02:36.757
Reporter: Lacey has not
been the only one--

02:36.757 --> 02:39.760
MAYBE IT'S TIME YOU
REACH OUT TO HER AGAIN.

02:39.760 --> 02:42.493
THIS IS SOMETHING
ONLY THE TWO OF YOU
HAVE IN COMMON.

02:42.493 --> 02:44.295
LACEY AND I HAVE
NOTHING IN COMMON.

02:44.295 --> 02:46.166
Reporter:
It was just five months ago

02:46.166 --> 02:48.769
that Desai's father,
prominent real estate developer

02:48.769 --> 02:51.171
Vikram Desai,
fell off a company yacht

02:51.171 --> 02:52.273
while intoxicated.

02:52.273 --> 02:54.845
His body was
never recovered.

02:54.845 --> 02:57.778
Widowed Karen Desai
returned home yesterday
with her son.

02:57.778 --> 02:59.780
I have no comment
right now, thank you.

02:59.780 --> 03:01.782
KAREN NEVER CHANGES.

03:01.782 --> 03:03.554
SHE'S ALWAYS READY
FOR A CLOSE-UP.

03:03.554 --> 03:04.915
Reporter: An appeal of
the school board's decision

03:04.915 --> 03:07.658
was launched just last week
by local parents,

03:07.658 --> 03:10.921
but thanks to a strong
counter fight by Karen Desai,

03:10.921 --> 03:12.793
it was quickly overturned,

03:12.793 --> 03:15.526
paving the way for
Desai's return today.

03:15.526 --> 03:17.528

03:56.467 --> 03:57.868
I JUST WANTED TO GET THROUGH
THE NEXT FEW YEARS

03:57.868 --> 03:59.340
AND JUST GET
THE HELL OUT OF HERE

03:59.340 --> 04:01.312
AND NOW IT'S LIKE...

04:01.312 --> 04:03.314
SUDDENLY I'M 11 AGAIN.

04:03.314 --> 04:05.976
CALL ME IF YOU NEED ME.
I CAN BE BACK HERE
IN FIVE MINUTES.

04:05.976 --> 04:07.648

04:17.328 --> 04:18.329
Rico: HEY, JO!

04:20.691 --> 04:22.663
HEY, YOU READY FOR TODAY?

04:22.663 --> 04:23.794
IT'S GONNA BE
A TOUGH ONE.

04:23.794 --> 04:25.666
YEAH, I'M WELL AWARE, RICO.
TRUST ME.

04:25.666 --> 04:26.937
YEAH, I PREPPED ALL NIGHT.

04:26.937 --> 04:29.670
MY MOM HAD TO MAKE ME
LIKE THREE ESPRESSO SHOTS.

04:29.670 --> 04:31.672
OKAY, WHAT ARE WE
TALKING ABOUT?

04:31.672 --> 04:33.273
OUR PRE-CALCULUS QUIZ.

04:33.273 --> 04:34.905
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

04:34.905 --> 04:36.947
DANNY DESAI.

04:36.947 --> 04:38.479
THE MURDERER.

04:38.479 --> 04:39.680
JUMP ROPE.

04:39.680 --> 04:41.352
DEAD AUNT.
TOWN SCANDAL.

04:41.352 --> 04:43.013
YEAH, I'M NOT--
I'M NOT FAMILIAR.

04:43.013 --> 04:45.916
WHY DID YOU THINK ALL OF
THESE REPORTERS WERE HERE?

04:45.916 --> 04:47.988
DOESN'T THE DEBATE TEAM
HAVE THEIR SHOWDOWN TODAY

04:47.988 --> 04:49.690
WITH DAYTON PREP?

04:49.690 --> 04:50.691
COME ON.

04:51.722 --> 04:52.863
OH!

04:52.863 --> 04:54.325
LOOK, LACE.
YOUR "SOCIO" LINE

04:54.325 --> 04:55.796
IS TRENDING ON TWITTER.

04:55.796 --> 04:57.798
GOOD. MAYBE HE'LL GET THE HINT
AND STAY AWAY FROM ME.

04:57.798 --> 05:00.000
HE'D BETTER, OR I'LL MAKE SURE
HE RUNS WEEPING BACK TO HIS
PADDED CELL

05:00.000 --> 05:01.672
IF HE TRIES TO MESS
WITH OUR GIRL.

05:01.672 --> 05:03.804
IT'S PROBABLY BETTER
NOT TO POKE THE PSYCHO.

05:03.804 --> 05:04.935
WHATEVER.
HE DOESN'T SCARE ME.

05:04.935 --> 05:06.337
I SPENT A SUMMER
IN THEATRE CAMP.

05:06.337 --> 05:07.678
THOSE GIRLS WILL
MESS YOU UP.

05:07.678 --> 05:08.809
YEAH, AND I'VE BEEN
SUPER VICIOUS

05:08.809 --> 05:10.341
SINCE I WENT OFF GLUTEN.

05:10.341 --> 05:11.682
WE GOT YOUR BACK,
LACE.

05:18.449 --> 05:19.450
HI, ARCH.

05:19.450 --> 05:20.451
HI, GIRLS.

05:20.451 --> 05:21.822
SAW YOU ON THE NEWS.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.894
YOU ARE SEXY WHEN
YOU'RE TRAUMATIZED.

05:23.894 --> 05:26.727
OH, THANKS, ARCH.
I'M GLAD MY SCARRED
PSYCHE TURNS YOU ON.

05:26.727 --> 05:28.799
DON'T STRESS, BABE.
50 BUCKS SAYS
THE FREAK TRANSFERS

05:28.799 --> 05:30.531
ONCE HE REALIZES
EVERYONE HATES HIM.

05:30.531 --> 05:31.802
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE
THEY LET HIM BACK IN.

05:31.802 --> 05:32.803
FULLY REFORMED, MY ASS.

05:32.803 --> 05:34.765
IT'S A CUTE ASS.

05:34.765 --> 05:36.667
- ( chuckles )
- OKAY, I GOTTA RUN.

05:36.667 --> 05:38.969
MR. KANE IS
A LATENESS NAZI, BUT..

05:42.673 --> 05:43.814
SEE YOU AT LUNCH.

05:43.814 --> 05:44.815
BYE.

05:46.677 --> 05:48.679
HER HAIR MAKES ME SAD.

05:48.679 --> 05:51.682
AT LEAST IT DRAWS
THE EYE AWAY FROM
THOSE FARMER'S BOOTS.

05:51.682 --> 05:53.824
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU USED TO BE SUCH GOOD
FRIENDS WITH HER, LACE.

05:53.824 --> 05:55.826
WHAT DID YOU TWO
EVEN TALK ABOUT?

05:59.830 --> 06:02.693
YEAH,
LIKE I EVEN REMEMBER.

06:02.693 --> 06:04.364
YO, SARITA.

06:04.364 --> 06:06.697
COME ON OVER HERE.

06:12.803 --> 06:15.876
HEY.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.377
HOW ARE YOU
HOLDING UP?

06:17.377 --> 06:19.850
UH, OKAY I GUESS.

06:19.850 --> 06:21.151
YOU?

06:21.151 --> 06:22.813
OKAY.

06:22.813 --> 06:24.685
I MEAN, MY MOM'S
PISSING ME OFF.

06:24.685 --> 06:26.857
DANNY COMING BACK
IS THE PERFECT EXCUSE

06:26.857 --> 06:28.158
FOR HER TO BULLDOZE
HER WAY INTO MY LIFE.

06:28.158 --> 06:29.820
YOU KNOW?

06:29.820 --> 06:31.992
YEAH.

06:31.992 --> 06:34.865
HAVE YOU STARTED HAVING
THOSE DREAMS AGAIN?

06:34.865 --> 06:36.597
NO, NOT REALLY.

06:36.597 --> 06:39.700
I HAVE.

06:39.700 --> 06:41.832
HE'S ALWAYS SQUEEZING
THAT YELLOW JUMP ROPE

06:41.832 --> 06:43.173
LIKE IT'S A PART
OF HIM OR SOMETHING.

06:43.173 --> 06:44.705
RED.

06:44.705 --> 06:47.177
IT WAS A RED JUMP ROPE.

06:47.177 --> 06:49.139
I THINK.

06:49.139 --> 06:51.141
LOOK, I--

06:51.141 --> 06:52.683
I KNOW YOU PROBABLY
DON'T EVEN CARE,

06:52.683 --> 06:54.184
AND IT'S NOT REALLY
YOUR SCENE,

06:54.184 --> 06:55.816
BUT ME AND MY FRIENDS
ARE HAVING A PARTY TONIGHT.

06:55.816 --> 06:57.888
ON A SCHOOL NIGHT?
YOU CRAZY KIDS.

06:57.888 --> 06:59.550
YEAH, WELL,

06:59.550 --> 07:00.821
REGINA'S PARENTS
ARE OUT OF TOWN

07:00.821 --> 07:02.823
SO WE THOUGHT WE'D
THROW A LITTLE

07:02.823 --> 07:04.525
"MICHAEL MEYERS
GOES TO OUR SCHOOL NOW,

07:04.525 --> 07:07.998
LET'S BLOW OFF SOME STEAM"
SORT OF SHINDIG.

07:09.700 --> 07:11.832
I MEAN, PRETTY MUCH
EVERYONE'S COMING,

07:11.832 --> 07:13.433
SO IF YOU WANT TO GO,
YOU CAN.

07:13.433 --> 07:14.835
I DON'T CARE.

07:14.835 --> 07:16.867
- DON'T DO ME ANY FAVORS.
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.

07:16.867 --> 07:18.709
LOOK, IT'S NOT LIKE
I LIE AROUND WISHING

07:18.709 --> 07:19.840
I COULD HANG WITH YOU
AND YOUR LAME

07:19.840 --> 07:21.812
SUPERFICIAL FRIENDS
ANYWAY.

07:21.812 --> 07:23.844
FINE.

07:23.844 --> 07:24.915
THEN DON'T COME.

07:26.717 --> 07:28.078
- LOOK, THERE'S DANNY.
- WHERE?

07:28.078 --> 07:29.950
IS THAT HIM?

07:32.152 --> 07:33.684
OH MY GOD, DANNY DESAI.

07:49.169 --> 07:50.701
PAGING DR. LECTER.

07:50.701 --> 07:52.703
YOUR SPAWN IS LOOSE
ON AISLE FOUR.

07:52.703 --> 07:54.104
I'D LET HIM LOOSE
ON MY AISLE.

08:15.826 --> 08:17.167
BOO.

08:19.830 --> 08:23.974
I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.
I WAS JUST JOKING.

08:23.974 --> 08:26.877
HOW ARE YOU GUYS?

08:26.877 --> 08:28.178
MR. DESAI?

08:28.178 --> 08:30.841
COME WITH ME,
PLEASE?

08:50.861 --> 08:53.533
WELL, ACADEMICALLY
I THINK YOU'LL BE
FINE.

08:53.533 --> 08:56.166
I SEE YOU PASSED
ALL YOUR ENTRANCE EXAMS
WITH FLYING COLORS.

08:56.166 --> 08:58.839
I AM EXTREMELY
PROUD OF HIM.

08:58.839 --> 09:01.311
WELL, I'VE HAD PLENTY
OF TIME TO PREPARE.

09:01.311 --> 09:03.543
FIVE YEARS OF
NON-STOP STUDY HALL.

09:03.543 --> 09:05.545
WELL,
THAT'S CERTAINLY TRUE.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.848
SOCIALLY HOWEVER,
IT WON'T BE EASY.

09:07.848 --> 09:09.850
EVEN MY FACULTY'S
A LITTLE SKITTISH.

09:09.850 --> 09:11.551
PRINCIPAL TANG?

09:11.551 --> 09:12.923
MY DANNY'S
A VERY SOCIAL BOY.

09:12.923 --> 09:14.925
ONCE EVERYONE GETS USED
TO HAVING HIM BACK,

09:14.925 --> 09:16.857
THINGS WILL
RETURN BACK TO NORMAL.

09:16.857 --> 09:17.958
RIGHT, SWEETHEART?

09:17.958 --> 09:19.960
YES, MOTHER.

09:19.960 --> 09:21.932
YOU'LL BE RUNNING
THE PTA AGAIN BY SPRING.

09:21.932 --> 09:24.865
( chuckles )
THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.

09:24.865 --> 09:26.336
I JUST THINK THAT
GREEN GROVE

09:26.336 --> 09:27.868
IS WORTH THE STRUGGLE.

09:27.868 --> 09:29.339
THIS IS OUR HOME.

09:29.339 --> 09:31.341
YES. YES.

09:31.341 --> 09:32.873
SO MANY HAPPY MEMORIES HERE.

09:32.873 --> 09:34.344
( chuckles )

09:34.344 --> 09:36.346
LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS
LATER, HONEY.

09:36.346 --> 09:38.308
WELL DANNY,
AS I ALWAYS LIKE TO SAY,

09:38.308 --> 09:40.310
THE THINGS THAT TEST US
DURING ADOLESCENCE

09:40.310 --> 09:44.254
TURN US INTO THE ADULTS
WE WERE ALWAYS MEANT TO BE.

09:44.254 --> 09:45.856
THAT'S VERY WISE,
PRINCIPAL.

09:45.856 --> 09:47.187
YEAH.

09:47.187 --> 09:49.219
AND HEY, IT DOESN'T HURT
HAVING SUCH A BEAUTIFUL,

09:49.219 --> 09:51.191
SUPPORTIVE MOTHER
GUIDING YOU.

09:51.191 --> 09:52.192
AM I RIGHT?

09:52.192 --> 09:54.625
MARK.
STOP IT.

09:54.625 --> 09:57.067
( chuckling )

10:05.175 --> 10:06.276
HEY.

10:06.276 --> 10:09.309
I'M SORRY I HAD TO
RUN OFF BEFORE.

10:09.309 --> 10:10.340
I HAVE TO GET
TO CLASS.

10:12.342 --> 10:14.645
RIGHT.
YEAH, OF COURSE.

10:15.886 --> 10:17.888
I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS.

10:17.888 --> 10:19.349
CAN WE JUST--

10:19.349 --> 10:21.191
CAN WE CHAT JUST FOR
A COUPLE MINUTES?

10:21.191 --> 10:22.853
FINE, DANNY.
LET'S CHAT.

10:22.853 --> 10:25.395
WHAT SHOULD WE
CHAT ABOUT FIRST?

10:25.395 --> 10:28.198
I KNOW, HOW ABOUT
MY LOST CHILDHOOD?

10:28.198 --> 10:32.132
OOH, OR MY WACKY DELIGHTFUL
JOURNEY INTO THE WORLD OF
POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS.

10:32.132 --> 10:33.403
I KNOW.
IT MUST HAVE BEEN ROUGH.

10:33.403 --> 10:35.736
OKAY, I CAN'T EVEN
BEGIN TO IMAGINE--

10:35.736 --> 10:37.637
NO, YOU CAN'T.
YOU WEREN'T HERE.

10:37.637 --> 10:40.640
I-- I KNOW.

10:40.640 --> 10:41.872
I TRIED TO STAY IN CONTACT.

10:41.872 --> 10:43.213
DIDN'T YOU GET ANY OF
THE LETTERS THAT I SENT?

10:43.213 --> 10:46.416
- YEAH, THEY BURNED GREAT.
- JO, PLEASE.

10:46.416 --> 10:48.218
IT'S ME.
I'M STILL THE SAME
BOY YOU GREW UP WITH.

10:48.218 --> 10:50.721
THE BOY I GREW UP WITH
WOULDN'T HAVE HURT A FLY.

10:50.721 --> 10:52.983
I'M NOT SOME PSYCHO.

10:52.983 --> 10:55.355
COME ON, JO,
YOU KNOW ME.

10:55.355 --> 10:57.688
YOU KNOW ME
BETTER THAN ANYONE.

10:57.688 --> 11:00.691
LOOK, I KNOW YOU WERE NEVER
A BIG AUNT TARA FAN,

11:00.691 --> 11:02.933
SO WHAT, DID SHE DO
SOMETHING TO YOU?

11:02.933 --> 11:06.266
DID SHE SAY SOMETHING?

11:06.266 --> 11:08.969
IF YOU HAD AN ACTUAL REASON,
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL IT TO THE
POLICE?

11:08.969 --> 11:10.440
BECAUSE I COULDN'T.

11:12.873 --> 11:16.376
OKAY, I STILL CAN'T.
I CAN'T TELL THAT TO
ANYONE EVER.

11:16.376 --> 11:18.809
( school bell rings )

11:18.809 --> 11:22.883
CAN--
CAN YOU AT LEAST--

11:22.883 --> 11:25.355
CAN YOU AT LEAST SHOW ME
TO MY NEXT CLASS?

11:27.217 --> 11:28.889
I--

11:28.889 --> 11:31.361
THIS PLACE IS LIKE
A GIANT MAZE.

11:31.361 --> 11:33.894
IT'S PSYCHOLOGY
WITH MRS. FISK.

11:33.894 --> 11:36.296
THAT'S MY NEXT CLASS TOO.

11:36.296 --> 11:39.229
GREAT. UM...

11:39.229 --> 11:40.370
LEAD THE WAY.

11:42.372 --> 11:44.404
SO SEMANTIC
ARE STORED FACTS,

11:44.404 --> 11:46.706
AND EPISODIC ARE
SEQUENCES OF MEMORIES.

11:46.706 --> 11:50.741
BUT WHAT IS
THE DEEPER DIFFERENCE?

11:52.883 --> 11:54.714
DANNY DESAI,

11:54.714 --> 11:56.216
YOU'VE BEEN IN MY CLASSROOM
10 MINUTES

11:56.216 --> 11:57.347
AND YOU ALREADY
APPEAR TO BE

11:57.347 --> 11:59.289
THE MOST INTERESTING THING
ABOUT IT.

11:59.289 --> 12:01.892
WE'RE SORRY, MISS FISK.
IT'S JUST THAT...

12:01.892 --> 12:04.895
NONE OF US HAVE SEEN
A REAL PSYCHO BEFORE, SO...

12:04.895 --> 12:06.226
PSYCHO.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.358
A WORD FOREVER HIJACKED
BY THE LAZY VULGARITY

12:08.358 --> 12:10.230
OF THE POPULAR CULTURE.

12:10.230 --> 12:12.232
SO, MR. DESAI.

12:12.232 --> 12:14.234
I HEAR FROM MY SOURCES

12:14.234 --> 12:16.236
THAT YOUR NICKNAME
ON THE TWITTER

12:16.236 --> 12:18.368
IS "THE SOCIO."

12:18.368 --> 12:19.910
IS IT?

12:19.910 --> 12:23.243
I GUESS I SHOULD GET INTO
THIS WHOLE TWITTER THING.

12:23.243 --> 12:25.375
YOU REALLY SHOULD.
IT'S A DELIGHTFUL
WASTE OF TIME.

12:25.375 --> 12:28.879
SO WHAT IS THE DEFINITION
OF SOCIO,

12:28.879 --> 12:33.353
OR IT'S MORE COMMON
SCIENTIFIC SYNONYM,
SOCIOPATH?

12:33.353 --> 12:36.526
A PERSON WHO WAKES UP
EVERY MORNING IN A POOL
OF SOMEONE ELSE'S BLOOD?

12:36.526 --> 12:38.028
( students laugh )

12:38.028 --> 12:40.230
Mrs. Fisk: NO, WRONG.

12:40.230 --> 12:42.893
ACTUALLY, MOST SOCIOPATHS
DON'T BOTHER KILLING PEOPLE.

12:42.893 --> 12:45.035
IT REQUIRES
TOO MUCH EFFORT.

12:45.035 --> 12:47.237
ANYONE ELSE?

12:47.237 --> 12:48.368
UM...

12:48.368 --> 12:51.201
A SOCIOPATH
HAS NO CONSCIENCE.

12:51.201 --> 12:54.544
NO ABILITY TO FEEL
EMPATHY FOR OTHER PEOPLE.

12:54.544 --> 12:56.376
THAT'S RIGHT.
GOOD, JO.

12:56.376 --> 12:58.248
- MRS. FISK?
- YEAH?

12:58.248 --> 12:59.810
HOW CAN YOU TELL

12:59.810 --> 13:01.251
IF SOMEONE'S A SOCIOPATH?

13:01.251 --> 13:02.382
I MEAN, YOU CAN'T--

13:02.382 --> 13:04.054
YOU CAN'T READ
SOMEONE'S MIND.

13:04.054 --> 13:06.256
THAT'S TRUE.
THE MIND IS A VAST WORLD

13:06.256 --> 13:09.219
OF FASCINATING
UNKNOWABLE MYSTERIES.

13:09.219 --> 13:12.222
ALTHOUGH SOCIOPATHS
LACK REAL HUMAN EMOTION,

13:12.222 --> 13:14.925
THEY ARE DAMN CLEVER
AT MIMICKING THEM.

13:17.367 --> 13:19.970
PLEASE TELL ME YOU DON'T
ACTUALLY WANT TO HAVE SEX
WITH A KILLER?

13:19.970 --> 13:22.232
I KNOW YOU'RE
STILL TRAUMATIZED,

13:22.232 --> 13:23.533
BUT HE WAS 11
WHEN HE DID THAT.

13:23.533 --> 13:25.906
NOTHING REALLY COUNTS
BEFORE YOU'RE 13, 14.

13:25.906 --> 13:27.237
IS SHE SERIOUS?

13:27.237 --> 13:28.378
I DID BALLET
WHEN I WAS 11.

13:28.378 --> 13:29.940
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ME
A BALLERINA.

13:29.940 --> 13:31.581
ARE THESE WORDS REALLY
COMING OUT OF YOUR
MOUTH RIGHT NOW?

13:31.581 --> 13:33.213
CHILL, LACE.
SHE'S ALL TALK.

13:33.213 --> 13:34.985
UM, EXCUSE ME?

13:34.985 --> 13:36.386
COME ON.
IF YOU HOOKED UP
WITH A FRACTION

13:36.386 --> 13:38.388
OF THE GUYS
YOU THOUGHT WERE HOT,

13:38.388 --> 13:41.121
YOU'D BE IN THE SLUT SECTION
OF THE GUINNESS BOOK OF WORLD
RECORDS BY NOW.

13:41.121 --> 13:43.223
IT'S NOT FUNNY.

13:43.223 --> 13:44.254
IT'S KIND OF FUNNY.

13:51.231 --> 13:52.362
ALL TALK, HUH?

13:52.362 --> 13:54.464
YEAH.

13:54.464 --> 13:56.536
SOCIO.

13:56.536 --> 13:58.969
COME OVER HERE.

14:03.243 --> 14:06.346
I'M NOT SURE I SHOULD
START RESPONDING TO
THAT NICKNAME.

14:08.248 --> 14:09.379
LACEY.

14:09.379 --> 14:11.121
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU.

14:11.121 --> 14:14.024
I'M REGINA,
LACEY'S BFF.

14:14.024 --> 14:15.926
BUT WE'RE REALLY
MORE LIKE SISTERS.

14:15.926 --> 14:17.387
RIGHT, LACE?

14:17.387 --> 14:19.259
RIGHT, REG.

14:19.259 --> 14:21.261
WILL YOU GIRLS EXCUSE ME?
I HAVE BIO IN 10.

14:25.135 --> 14:26.536
SHE'S SUPER SENSITIVE.

14:26.536 --> 14:28.268
SHE'LL GET OVER IT.

14:28.268 --> 14:29.399
EVERYONE WILL.

14:29.399 --> 14:31.241
THIS SCHOOL'S
ACTUALLY VERY FRIENDLY.

14:31.241 --> 14:32.472
CLEARLY.

14:32.472 --> 14:33.603
I FEEL LIKE I'M IN
AN EPISODE OF "GLEE"

14:33.603 --> 14:35.375
AND EVERYONE'S ABOUT TO
BREAK OUT INTO SONG.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.207
THEY LET YOU WATCH
"GLEE" IN PRISON?

14:37.207 --> 14:38.508
IT'S PART OF OUR PUNISHMENT.

14:38.508 --> 14:40.380
( giggles )

14:40.380 --> 14:42.252
OKAY, SO LISTEN.

14:42.252 --> 14:44.184
I AM THROWING A PARTY
AT MY HOUSE TONIGHT.

14:44.184 --> 14:46.386
- ARE YOU IN?
- REGINA?

14:46.386 --> 14:47.387
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

14:47.387 --> 14:50.420
IGNORE SARITA.
SHE'S FRIGID.

14:50.420 --> 14:51.521
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY?

14:51.521 --> 14:53.263
WELL, UH...

14:55.926 --> 14:57.097
WHERE'D YOU GET
THAT NECKLACE?

14:59.269 --> 15:00.270
IT WAS A GIFT.

15:00.270 --> 15:02.502
WHY?
YOU LIKE IT?

15:05.405 --> 15:06.937
UH, THANKS FOR
THE INVITE.

15:06.937 --> 15:08.939
MAYBE I'LL POP BY.

15:08.939 --> 15:10.410
COOL.

15:10.410 --> 15:11.581
OH!

15:12.943 --> 15:14.914
ARE YOU HIGH
ON HORMONES?

15:14.914 --> 15:16.416
I HOPE HE'S THAT
INTENSE IN BED.

15:16.416 --> 15:17.917
OH MY GOD.

15:20.050 --> 15:22.052
OKAY, SO IF WE MULTIPLY THAT

15:22.052 --> 15:23.423
BY THE RATE OF ACCELERATION

15:23.423 --> 15:25.655
WE GET...

15:25.655 --> 15:28.928
A LADY WHO'S APPARENTLY
OKAY WITH AN "A-"

15:28.928 --> 15:30.400
ON THIS PROBLEM SET.

15:30.400 --> 15:33.003
OKAY, LET'S SAY
YOU KILLED YOUR AUNT.

15:33.003 --> 15:34.204
OKAY.

15:34.204 --> 15:36.006
BUT YOU BELIEVE YOU HAD
A REASON FOR DOING IT.

15:36.006 --> 15:37.467
WOULDN'T YOU WANT TO
EXPLAIN IT TO PEOPLE?

15:37.467 --> 15:40.940
YEAH, I DON'T KNOW.
I KIND OF LIKE MY AUNT.

15:40.940 --> 15:43.273
SHE BUYS ME PRESENTS
AND MAKES YUMMY APPLE
CINNAMON PANCAKES.

15:43.273 --> 15:44.944
HELPFUL, RICO.
THANK YOU.

15:44.944 --> 15:46.116
YEAH.
YOU'RE SO WELCOME.

15:46.116 --> 15:48.478
NOW, AS OUR
GENERATION MIGHT SAY,

15:48.478 --> 15:50.280
LET'S QUIT THIS HERE
CHILLAXING

15:50.280 --> 15:52.622
AND GET ALL UP IN THIS
DOPE PROBLEM SET, YO.

15:55.725 --> 15:58.088
OH, CHILLAXING,
IT'S LIKE THIS WORD

15:58.088 --> 15:59.729
THEY SAY NOW WHERE YOU
MIX LIKE CHILL AND RELAX.

15:59.729 --> 16:01.531
YEAH, I GET IT.
JUST NEVER DO IT AGAIN.

16:01.531 --> 16:02.532
OKAY.

16:03.733 --> 16:05.535
( bell jingles )

16:08.568 --> 16:10.670
OKAY.

16:10.670 --> 16:12.002
WHATEVER YOU DO,

16:12.002 --> 16:15.275
DON'T TURN AROUND
AND THEN LOOK UP.

16:16.406 --> 16:18.508
I SAID DON'T DO IT.

16:23.413 --> 16:26.286
IS THERE ANY CHANCE
THAT HE DIDN'T SEE ME?

16:26.286 --> 16:27.557
I DON'T KNOW.
'CAUSE THEN I'D HAVE TO LOOK.

16:31.061 --> 16:33.293
STILL A REGULAR HERE,
I SEE.

16:33.293 --> 16:36.366
A FACT YOU OBVIOUSLY
DID NOT FORGET.

16:36.366 --> 16:38.328
I'M NOT STALKING YOU,
I PROMISE.

16:38.328 --> 16:39.399
I CAME FOR THE PIE.

16:42.732 --> 16:44.404
DANNY.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

16:44.404 --> 16:46.736
OH, HI. I'M RICO.
I'M EXTRAORDINARILY
UNCOMFORTABLE RIGHT NOW.

16:49.279 --> 16:51.211
YEAH.
ME AND YOU BOTH, RICO.

16:58.418 --> 17:01.421
DO YOU THINK THAT I WANTED
TO COME BACK HERE?

17:03.423 --> 17:05.755
THAT IT WAS MY CHOICE?
IT WASN'T.

17:05.755 --> 17:08.298
IT WAS MY MOM'S,
SO I'M HERE.

17:08.298 --> 17:09.559
AND NOW EVERYWHERE I GO,

17:09.559 --> 17:11.301
IT'S LIKE I'M
BACK AT THAT DAY.

17:11.301 --> 17:13.433
LIKE SUDDENLY
I'M 11 AGAIN.

17:16.436 --> 17:18.308
AM I SUPPOSED TO
FEEL BAD FOR YOU?

17:18.308 --> 17:21.111
NO. YOU HAVE EVERY
REASON IN THE WORLD
TO HATE ME.

17:21.111 --> 17:23.743
SOMEHOW I STILL THOUGHT
YOU'D BE THE ONE PERSON

17:23.743 --> 17:25.275
TO GIVE ME
HALF A CHANCE.

17:31.651 --> 17:33.483
OH MY GOD,
THAT WAS TENSE.

17:33.483 --> 17:35.425
I FEEL LIKE I JUST
LIVED THROUGH A HITCHCOCK MOVIE.

17:46.196 --> 17:47.337
DANNY, WAIT.

17:49.339 --> 17:51.341
HEY.

17:51.341 --> 17:53.673
LOOK.

17:53.673 --> 17:56.346
I KNOW THIS MUST
BE HARD FOR YOU.

17:56.346 --> 17:58.678
BUT YOU CAN'T KEEP
COMING UP TO ME

17:58.678 --> 18:00.810
AT SCHOOL
OR THE DINER,

18:00.810 --> 18:02.682
OR ANYWHERE, OKAY?

18:02.682 --> 18:04.454
IT'S HARD FOR ME TOO.

18:04.454 --> 18:06.316
FAIR ENOUGH.

18:06.316 --> 18:07.787
I'LL LEAVE YOU ALONE.

18:07.787 --> 18:09.389
OKAY, THANKS.

18:10.660 --> 18:13.593
I'M SORRY
ABOUT YOUR DAD.

18:13.593 --> 18:15.425
HE WAS ALWAYS
REALLY NICE TO ME.

18:15.425 --> 18:17.197
WELL, HE WAS
A DEFINITE JO FAN.

18:23.333 --> 18:25.635
YOU'RE WONDERING IF I'M
MIMICKING HUMAN EMOTION,
AREN'T YOU?

18:25.635 --> 18:28.208
NO, I'M NOT.
I'M NOT DOING THAT.

18:28.208 --> 18:30.340
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

18:30.340 --> 18:32.342
AFTER THAT CRAZY CLASS,
I'M ASSUMING PRETTY MUCH

18:32.342 --> 18:35.415
EVERYONE I SEE
IS A SOCIOPATH.

18:38.348 --> 18:40.119
LOOK, UM...

18:40.119 --> 18:42.222
THERE'S THIS PARTY?

18:42.222 --> 18:44.224
DANNY,
I JUST GOT--

18:44.224 --> 18:47.227
WAIT, ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
REGINA CRANE'S PARTY?

18:47.227 --> 18:49.329
YEAH, THAT'S THE ONE.

18:49.329 --> 18:51.331
HOW DO YOU
KNOW ABOUT THAT?

18:51.331 --> 18:52.732
BECAUSE I WAS
INVITED TO IT.

18:52.732 --> 18:55.605
YOU, INVITED
BY AN ACTUAL HUMAN?

18:55.605 --> 18:57.337
YEAH.

18:57.337 --> 19:01.171
OF COURSE IT'D BE
EASIER TO SHOW UP THERE
WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

19:01.171 --> 19:03.343
MIGHT TAKE SOME OF
THE EDGE OFF.

19:30.400 --> 19:32.342
I DON'T DRINK
OR MINGLE.

19:32.342 --> 19:34.344
ESPECIALLY WITH
THESE PEOPLE.

19:34.344 --> 19:36.346
OKAY, THEN WHY
ARE YOU HERE?

19:36.346 --> 19:39.479
I'VE GOTTA TELL MY GRANDKIDS
I DID SOMETHING STUPID
IN HIGH SCHOOL, RIGHT?

19:39.479 --> 19:41.351
GOOD POINT.

19:41.351 --> 19:44.684
SOCIO, YOU CAME!

19:46.216 --> 19:49.489
AND LOOK WHO YOU BROUGHT.

19:49.489 --> 19:51.361
LACEY INVITED ME,
ACTUALLY.

19:51.361 --> 19:52.692
OH.

19:52.692 --> 19:54.224
OKAY.

19:54.224 --> 19:56.426
WELL, SO GLAD YOU
DECIDED TO JOIN US.

19:56.426 --> 19:57.467
YAY.

19:57.467 --> 20:00.370
COME ON,
I'LL INTRODUCE YOU TO PEOPLE.

20:00.370 --> 20:01.701
UM...

20:01.701 --> 20:02.772
I DON'T...

20:07.206 --> 20:08.978
SO WHAT'S UP
WITH YOU AND DANNY?

20:08.978 --> 20:10.280
UM, UP?

20:10.280 --> 20:11.681
NOTHING'S UP.

20:11.681 --> 20:13.683
DON'T PLAY DUMB
WITH ME.

20:13.683 --> 20:15.345
YOU WANT HIM,
DON'T YOU?

20:15.345 --> 20:17.687
UM, NO.
DO YOU WANT HIM, REGINA?

20:17.687 --> 20:19.218
UH, YEAH.

20:19.218 --> 20:20.350
I'LL PASS HIM
TO YOU AFTER.

20:20.350 --> 20:21.691
SHARING IS CARING.

20:21.691 --> 20:23.693
THAT'S OKAY.
HE'S ALL YOURS.

20:23.693 --> 20:26.356
OH, JO.
YOU ARE SO COOL.

20:26.356 --> 20:29.228
EVERYONE IS SO
WRONG ABOUT YOU.

20:29.228 --> 20:31.230
SO YOU'RE REALLY
NOT WORRIED ABOUT

20:31.230 --> 20:32.702
GETTING TOO CLOSE
TO HIM, HUH?

20:32.702 --> 20:34.364
WHATEV.
WE'LL USE PROTECTION.

20:34.364 --> 20:35.705
NO, THAT'S NOT--

20:35.705 --> 20:37.967
I MEANT, UM...
BECAUSE OF HIS PAST.

20:37.967 --> 20:39.909
YOU KNOW, THE WHOLE
MURDERED HIS AUNT,

20:39.909 --> 20:41.511
"SOCIO" THING?

20:41.511 --> 20:43.713
UH, HE'S HERE AND HE'S
CLEARLY NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

20:43.713 --> 20:45.375
WHAT ARE WE ALL GONNA DO,
HATE HIM FOREVER?

20:45.375 --> 20:47.717
STOP. HOSTESS.
THANKS.

20:50.249 --> 20:53.252
TWIRL IT, SWIRL IT,
AND KNOCK IT DOWN.

20:57.357 --> 20:59.028
( coughs )

21:01.030 --> 21:02.962
CAN I GET ONE
GIN AND TONIC,
BARTENDER?

21:02.962 --> 21:04.694
EASY ON THE GIN,
HEAVY ON THE TONIC.

21:04.694 --> 21:06.466
MY TOLERANCE ISN'T
WHAT IT USED TO BE.

21:06.466 --> 21:09.469
HEY, CREEP. ARE YOU TRYING
TO ADD STALKER TO YOUR
CRIMINAL RECORD?

21:09.469 --> 21:11.741
SARITA.
YOU'RE SARITA, RIGHT?

21:11.741 --> 21:13.573
NOW I REMEMBER YOU.

21:13.573 --> 21:16.506
YOU WERE THE ONE WITH
THE FACIAL HAIR PROBLEM
IN FIFTH GRADE.

21:16.506 --> 21:18.648
I THINK YOU'RE MISTAKEN,
FREAK.

21:18.648 --> 21:20.380
NO.
NO, I DON'T
THINK I AM.

21:20.380 --> 21:21.981
YOU HAD TO LEAVE
SCHOOL FOR A WEEK

21:21.981 --> 21:24.984
TO HAVE SOME SORT OF
CHEMICAL LASER
ELECTRODE PROCEDURE

21:24.984 --> 21:26.656
THAT THEY ONLY APPROVED
IN GERMANY OR SOMETHING?

21:26.656 --> 21:28.057
LOOKS LIKE IT
WORKED OKAY.

21:28.057 --> 21:29.959
YOU CAN STILL SEE THE FAINT
OUTLINE OF A MUSTACHE,

21:29.959 --> 21:31.561
BUT NOTHING TOO BAD.

21:33.463 --> 21:34.624
I SEE YOU'RE WINNING OVER
THE STUDENT BODY

21:34.624 --> 21:36.726
ONE CHARMING REMARK AT A TIME.
GREAT STRATEGY.

21:36.726 --> 21:38.067
GOT YOU TO SAY
SOMETHING TO ME.

21:39.699 --> 21:42.031
GOT JO TO FOLLOW YOU AROUND
LIKE A PUPPY DOG IN UNDER A DAY.

21:42.031 --> 21:43.032
IMPRESSIVE.

21:43.032 --> 21:44.374
PUPPY DOG.

21:44.374 --> 21:46.576
THAT'S-- THAT'S HARSH.

21:46.576 --> 21:48.378
DIDN'T YOU HEAR?
I'M A BITCH NOW.

21:48.378 --> 21:50.039
TOLD YOU SHE'D
COME AROUND.

21:50.039 --> 21:53.483
CONVO-ING WITH THE SOCIO?
WHAT WOULD ARCHIE THINK?

21:53.483 --> 21:55.445
LACEY'S BOYFRIEND.
HE'S CAPTAIN OF THE SOCCER TEAM.

21:55.445 --> 21:57.046
GRADE-A STUD MUFFIN.

21:57.046 --> 22:00.049
BUT YOU COULD SO
OUT-STUD HIM.

22:00.049 --> 22:02.422
YOU KNOW,
IN A HYPOTHETICAL STUD-OFF.

22:02.422 --> 22:03.593
HE HERE?

22:03.593 --> 22:05.525
UH, NO.
HE HAS A GAME TOMORROW.

22:05.525 --> 22:07.357
WELL, GET HIM HERE.

22:07.357 --> 22:11.060
LET'S TURN THIS STUD-OFF
DREAM INTO A REALITY.

22:11.060 --> 22:13.733
SOCIO VERSUS SOCCER CAPTAIN?

22:13.733 --> 22:15.405
I'D PAY GOOD MONEY
TO SEE THAT.

22:15.405 --> 22:17.567
MAYBE IT'S TIME TO GIVE
THE WHOLE "SOCIO" THING
A REST?

22:17.567 --> 22:19.469
HEY, YOU STARTED IT.

22:23.112 --> 22:24.714
SOCIO.

22:24.714 --> 22:26.616
IT'S KIND OF CATCHY, ACTUALLY.

22:27.847 --> 22:29.549
ANYWAY, I SHOULD GO

22:29.549 --> 22:31.381
BEFORE JO STARTS
HAVING ACTUAL FUN.

22:31.381 --> 22:33.483
IT WAS NICE TO
SEE YOU, LACEY.

22:33.483 --> 22:34.824
REGINA.

22:37.056 --> 22:38.388
WOW.

22:38.388 --> 22:40.129
DID THE SOCIO
JUST DITCH US?

22:40.129 --> 22:41.591
AFTER THE WAY
YOU WERE ACTING,

22:41.591 --> 22:43.062
CAN YOU BLAME HIM?

22:43.062 --> 22:44.394
CHILL OUT.

22:44.394 --> 22:45.735
I WAS JUST HAVING
A LITTLE FUN.

22:45.735 --> 22:47.397
DON'T BE SO SENSITIVE.

22:50.800 --> 22:52.802
- ( dance music playing )
- ( people chattering )

22:55.074 --> 22:57.707
EXCUSE ME.
COULD YOU PLEASE WATCH
WHERE YOU'RE SWINGING

22:57.707 --> 23:00.149
THOSE LONG CREEPY
APE ARMS? 'KAY, THANKS.

23:00.149 --> 23:01.611
YES.

23:01.611 --> 23:03.382
THEY ARE DISPROPORTIONATE
TO MY BODY AT THE MOMENT,

23:03.382 --> 23:06.456
BUT THE INTERNET SAYS
THAT THAT'S REALLY NORMAL.

23:06.456 --> 23:07.887
WOW.
SOMEONE'S HAVING SOME FUN.

23:07.887 --> 23:09.459
I AM HAVING FUN.

23:09.459 --> 23:11.390
AND I WANT TO HAVE
EVEN MORE FUN,

23:11.390 --> 23:13.723
SO DEAL WITH IT.

23:13.723 --> 23:15.394
SCOTT?

23:15.394 --> 23:16.796
MEET JO.

23:16.796 --> 23:18.397
SHE WANTS TO
HAVE MORE FUN.

23:18.397 --> 23:19.569
TAKE YOUR SHIRT OFF.

23:19.569 --> 23:20.700
( chuckles )

23:23.072 --> 23:25.074
( cheering, whooping )

23:28.738 --> 23:30.580
POUR THIS ON HIM,

23:30.580 --> 23:31.581
THEN LICK IT OFF.

23:31.581 --> 23:33.412
OFF OF HIM?
I DON'T THINK SO.

23:33.412 --> 23:35.144
- YEAH.
- DO IT.

23:35.144 --> 23:37.587
( chanting "Do it!" )

23:45.525 --> 23:46.596
( cheering )

23:51.200 --> 23:53.603
- SOCIO.
- OKAY.

23:53.603 --> 23:56.065
FINALLY I'VE GOT YOU
ALL TO MYSELF.

23:56.065 --> 23:59.208
COME WITH ME.
THERE'S SOMETHING
I WANT TO SHOW YOU.

23:59.208 --> 24:01.741
WANT A HINT?
IT'S MY BED.

24:01.741 --> 24:05.144
Jo: LEAVE ME ALONE.
DON'T TOUCH ME.

24:05.144 --> 24:06.546
GET THE HELL
OFF OF ME. STOP!

24:06.546 --> 24:07.617
COME ON, JO.
SHOT FOR SHOT.

24:07.617 --> 24:08.778
IT'S GREEN GROVE HIGH LAW.

24:08.778 --> 24:11.881
IT'S A DUMB GROSS LAW. STOP!

24:11.881 --> 24:13.983
HEY. HEY HEY HEY.

24:13.983 --> 24:16.155
MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS,
FREAK.

24:16.155 --> 24:19.458
FREAK? REALLY?

24:21.190 --> 24:23.733
IT'S SO GENERIC.

24:23.733 --> 24:25.535
HOW ABOUT ROPE BOY?

24:26.666 --> 24:29.198
NOW THAT-- THAT'S
A LITTLE BIT MORE POINTED.

24:29.198 --> 24:30.640
BUT WHY DON'T WE JUST--

24:30.640 --> 24:32.241
( all gasping )

24:35.204 --> 24:37.847
( whispering )

25:05.835 --> 25:08.177
( laughing ) WAIT, THAT WAS
AMAZING THOUGH.

25:08.177 --> 25:10.710
WHAT THE HELL DID YOU
SAY TO HIM, ANYWAY?

25:10.710 --> 25:12.842
I DON'T KNOW.
SOMETHING ABOUT SUING HIM
FOR ASSAULT AND WINNING?

25:12.842 --> 25:13.843
( horn honks )

25:19.188 --> 25:22.852
THOUGHT SO. THEY DIDN'T
TEACH YOU HOW TO DRIVE
IN PRISON, DID THEY?

25:22.852 --> 25:23.853
JUST GET IN.

25:23.853 --> 25:25.595
DANNY, IT'S LACEY.

25:25.595 --> 25:27.927
- I KNOW IT'S LACEY.
- LACEY, DANNY.

25:27.927 --> 25:30.129
- DANNY, LACEY.
- WATCH YOUR HEAD.

25:36.736 --> 25:39.609
MOM, DAD, YOU CAME.
WELCOME.

25:39.609 --> 25:41.911
WE'LL TALK ABOUT THIS
TOMORROW.

25:41.911 --> 25:43.813
STUDYING WITH RICO,
HUH?

25:43.813 --> 25:45.314
THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID.
STAY CALM.

25:45.314 --> 25:46.846
FINE, OR DON'T.

25:46.846 --> 25:48.317
I'M GONNA GET HER
A GLASS OF WATER.

25:48.317 --> 25:49.779
Jo: THANK YOU, I LOVE YOU.

25:49.779 --> 25:51.621
CHIEF MASTERSON,
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

25:53.853 --> 25:55.725
TRY NOT TO BE
TOO HARD ON HER, SIR.

25:55.725 --> 25:56.986
MOM!

25:56.986 --> 25:58.187
THE PARTY WAS AWESOME.

25:58.187 --> 26:00.790
THIS DUDE WAS LIKE
"TAKE YOUR SHIRT OFF!

26:00.790 --> 26:02.832
I WANT TO LICK YOU."
AND DANNY WAS ALL

26:02.832 --> 26:04.193
"GET AWAY FROM HER.
YOU SUCK!"

26:04.193 --> 26:06.195
AND REGINA AND I
TOTALLY BONDED.

26:06.195 --> 26:07.336
SHE WAS LIKE
"I WANT DANNY."

26:07.336 --> 26:08.998
AND I WAS LIKE
"YOU CAN HAVE HIM."

26:08.998 --> 26:12.041
AND SHE WAS LIKE
"I'LL PASS HIM TO YOU AFTER.

26:12.041 --> 26:14.203
SHARING IS CARING."

26:16.045 --> 26:16.906
YEAH, I SHOULD PROBABLY--

26:20.910 --> 26:22.982
( sighs )

26:24.353 --> 26:26.886
I GUESS SHE LET GO OF
ALL THAT UNRESOLVED ANGER.

26:28.858 --> 26:29.889
SILVER LINING?

26:29.889 --> 26:30.860
A THIN ONE.

26:30.860 --> 26:32.722
( chuckles )

26:44.974 --> 26:47.336
THANKS. YOU SAVED ME
AN HOUR OF TEDIOUS
DRUNK WALKING.

26:47.336 --> 26:48.337
DON'T MENTION IT.

26:48.337 --> 26:51.080
SERIOUSLY.
TO ANYONE EVER.

26:51.080 --> 26:52.882
GOT IT.

26:52.882 --> 26:56.185
SO, SINCE ALL OF THIS
APPARENTLY NEVER HAPPENED,

26:56.185 --> 26:58.047
DO YOU WANT TO COME IN,
HANG OUT?

26:58.047 --> 26:59.118
( scoffs )

26:59.118 --> 27:01.891
WE HAVEN'T REALLY GOT
A CHANCE TO TALK.

27:01.891 --> 27:05.054
YOU REALIZE THAT'S
INTENTIONAL, RIGHT?

27:06.726 --> 27:10.059
I HAVE BLUE RANCH
POTATO CHIPS.

27:10.059 --> 27:11.801
SWEET CHEDDAR?

27:14.003 --> 27:15.865
I HAVEN'T EATEN
THESE IN YEARS.

27:15.865 --> 27:17.737
WELL, ME EITHER.

27:17.737 --> 27:18.868
( chuckles )

27:18.868 --> 27:20.970
DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN--

27:20.970 --> 27:22.872
WHEN WE DARED JO
TO EAT A BAG OF
EVERY FLAVOR?

27:22.872 --> 27:24.213
UH-HUH.

27:24.213 --> 27:26.345
SHE MADE IT ALL THE WAY
TO SPICY JALAPENO

27:26.345 --> 27:28.077
BEFORE VOMITING ALL OVER
MY DAD'S FAVORITE

27:28.077 --> 27:29.248
NEW YORK YANKEES
THROW RUG.

27:31.881 --> 27:33.683
( sighs )

27:33.683 --> 27:34.884
POOR JO.

27:34.884 --> 27:36.886
WHY? MY DAD
BLAMED ME, NOT HER.

27:36.886 --> 27:39.228
NO,
I MEAN NOW.

27:39.228 --> 27:41.660
SHE'S HAVING A HARD TIME,
UNLIKE YOU.

27:41.660 --> 27:44.233
OKAY, WHAT'D SHE SAY?

27:44.233 --> 27:46.696
I DITCHED HER?
ABANDONED HER?

27:46.696 --> 27:49.238
NO.
OF COURSE NOT.

27:49.238 --> 27:50.239
WHY?
THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED?

27:52.241 --> 27:56.045
DO YOU THINK IT WAS EASY
BEING THE BEST FRIENDS
WITH A CHILD MURDERER?

27:56.045 --> 27:58.878
NO,
I'M SURE IT WASN'T.

27:58.878 --> 28:00.209
YEAH, IT WASN'T.

28:00.209 --> 28:02.011
FORGET THE FACT
THAT YOU TURNED
OUR CHILDHOODS

28:02.011 --> 28:03.212
INTO "CHILDREN OF THE CORN."

28:03.212 --> 28:05.885
WE WERE BOTH
OSTRACIZED.

28:05.885 --> 28:08.718
ASSOCIATED WITH
THE PSYCHO FREAK.

28:08.718 --> 28:11.761
MIDDLE SCHOOL'S ROUGH ENOUGH
WITHOUT ALL THAT CRAP.

28:11.761 --> 28:15.895
SO EXCUSE ME FOR DOING
WHAT I HAD TO DO TO SURVIVE.

28:15.895 --> 28:17.797
TO MOVE ON.

28:17.797 --> 28:19.899
LOOK.

28:21.230 --> 28:23.933
YOU'RE RIGHT, LACEY.
AND I'M SORRY.

28:23.933 --> 28:25.905
I NEVER MEANT TO
HURT YOU AND JO.

28:25.905 --> 28:27.977
YOU MEANT TO HURT SOMEONE.

28:32.782 --> 28:35.214
DO YOU REGRET IT?

28:35.214 --> 28:37.316
THE PAST IS IN THE PAST.

28:40.219 --> 28:41.791
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT I REALLY REGRET?

28:41.791 --> 28:44.223
NOT IF IT'S CREEPY.

28:47.757 --> 28:49.899
I REGRET...

28:49.899 --> 28:51.761
NOT GROWING UP
WITH YOU AND JO.

28:53.362 --> 28:55.364
RUINING WHAT WE HAD.

28:55.364 --> 28:58.267
WE HAD SOME FUN,
DIDN'T WE?

29:01.240 --> 29:03.242
I MISS THAT.

29:03.242 --> 29:04.914
AND I THINK
YOU MISS IT TOO.

29:08.047 --> 29:10.349
I THOUGHT THE PAST
WAS IN THE PAST?

29:16.886 --> 29:19.388
YOU'RE HOGGING
ALL THE BLUE RANCH.

29:45.784 --> 29:46.916
( cellphone dings )

29:56.265 --> 29:57.496
( typing )

30:13.142 --> 30:14.183
( typing )

30:23.592 --> 30:24.924
( dings )

30:56.926 --> 30:58.928
( guitar music playing )

31:02.531 --> 31:05.594
( guitar music continues )

31:05.594 --> 31:08.938
♪ COMING OUT AND
TAKING EVERYTHING ♪

31:16.605 --> 31:19.949
♪ 'CAUSE LIES GO ♪

31:19.949 --> 31:22.611

31:28.958 --> 31:31.921

31:31.921 --> 31:33.923

31:33.923 --> 31:35.925
REGINA!

31:37.266 --> 31:39.268
( sighs, speaking Spanish )

31:55.284 --> 31:56.515
( screams )

32:16.505 --> 32:18.207
( doorbell rings )

32:23.172 --> 32:25.014
- HEY.
- HEY.

32:25.014 --> 32:27.516
UM...

32:27.516 --> 32:30.379
I JUST--
I WANTED TO SAY THANK YOU

32:30.379 --> 32:32.181
FOR GETTING ME
BACK LAST NIGHT.

32:32.181 --> 32:34.183
AND FOR STANDING UP FOR ME
TO THAT WANNABE

32:34.183 --> 32:35.524
RAPIST JOCK DOUCHE.

32:35.524 --> 32:37.726
I THINK THAT MAY ACTUALLY
BE HIS FULL LEGAL NAME.

32:37.726 --> 32:39.288
( chuckles )

32:39.288 --> 32:40.689
WANT TO COME INSIDE?

32:42.691 --> 32:44.563
COME ON, IT'S FREEZING.
COME INSIDE.

32:49.698 --> 32:52.001
JO, LOOK AT YOU!

32:52.001 --> 32:53.672
OH, YOU'RE SO BIG!

32:53.672 --> 32:57.606
NOT IN A FAT WAY.
IN A GROWN-UP WAY.

32:57.606 --> 32:58.977
OH, IT'S SO GOOD
TO SEE YOU.

32:58.977 --> 33:00.709
YEAH, IT'S GOOD
TO SEE YOU TOO,
MRS. DESAI.

33:00.709 --> 33:02.311
WELL WELL.
TWO DAYS BACK

33:02.311 --> 33:04.013
AND YOU'VE CERTAINLY
HAD YOUR SHARE OF

33:04.013 --> 33:06.185
FEMALE VISITORS,
SWEETHEART.

33:09.088 --> 33:11.560
VISITORS?
AS IN PLURAL?

33:11.560 --> 33:13.192
AS IN TWO.

33:13.192 --> 33:14.723
LACEY ENDED UP
STAYING THE NIGHT HERE.

33:14.723 --> 33:17.666
OH. WOW.

33:17.666 --> 33:20.199
- YOU GUYS DIDN'T--
- NO NO. I SWEAR.

33:20.199 --> 33:22.301
( chuckles )
WE JUST TALKED AND
THEN WENT TO SLEEP.

33:22.301 --> 33:26.004
BUT LET'S JUST TRY
TO KEEP THAT BETWEEN US?

33:26.004 --> 33:27.476
I THINK THAT GUY
THAT SHE'S DATING

33:27.476 --> 33:30.379
WOULD LOVE NOTHING MORE
THAN TO TAKE IT THE WRONG WAY.

33:30.379 --> 33:31.640
OKAY.

33:31.640 --> 33:35.184
DANNY! JO!
COME HERE.

33:35.184 --> 33:37.246
DANNY!

33:37.246 --> 33:39.388
Male Reporter:
Has the exclusive
story, reporting.

33:39.388 --> 33:42.291
Female Reporter:
A housekeeper discovered
Green Grove High School

33:42.291 --> 33:44.753
student Regina Crane
beaten to death

33:44.753 --> 33:47.056
inside of her home
around 6:30 this morning.

33:47.056 --> 33:49.027
We have no suspects
at this time,

33:49.027 --> 33:52.501
but I want to assure
the Green Grove community

33:52.501 --> 33:55.033
that we will use
every resource at
our disposal

33:55.033 --> 33:57.035
to catch the killer.

33:57.035 --> 33:59.168
This unthinkable crime
will not go unpunished.

34:06.215 --> 34:07.516
IT'S SO WEIRD.
I FEEL LIKE SHE'S

34:07.516 --> 34:09.248
GONNA COME BOUNCING IN
ANY SECOND.

34:09.248 --> 34:11.320
I TOLD HER.

34:11.320 --> 34:15.484
I BEGGED HER NOT
TO THROW HERSELF
AT THAT PSYCHO.

34:15.484 --> 34:16.685
I EVEN OFFERED TO BANG HER

34:16.685 --> 34:18.657
IF SHE WAS ITCHING
TO GET BANGED.

34:18.657 --> 34:20.359
IF ONLY SHE'D LISTENED.

34:20.359 --> 34:22.331
ARE WE SURE
IT WAS DANNY?

34:22.331 --> 34:24.833
SCOTT, TELL LACEY WHAT
DANNY WHISPERED TO YOU.

34:24.833 --> 34:26.795
HE SAID THAT IF
I DIDN'T BACK OFF

34:26.795 --> 34:28.237
THAT HE'D KILL ME

34:28.237 --> 34:30.699
AND HE'D ENJOY IT
LIKE HE DID LAST
TIME.

34:30.699 --> 34:32.771
STILL THINK THE CREEP
IS INNOCENT?

34:35.744 --> 34:38.777
REGINA WAS A LOVING,

34:38.777 --> 34:40.679
ENERGETIC,

34:40.679 --> 34:43.112
POSITIVE FORCE
IN OUR COMMUNITY.

34:43.112 --> 34:46.215
NOW WE MUST COME
TOGETHER IN OUR GRIEF

34:46.215 --> 34:47.686
AND SUPPORT EACH OTHER.

34:47.686 --> 34:49.688
SOCIO.

34:50.759 --> 34:51.760
SOCIO.

34:51.760 --> 34:52.761
- FREAK.
- SOCIO.

34:52.761 --> 34:54.393
Principal: I URGE YOU GUYS.

34:54.393 --> 34:56.795
- ( students muttering )
- Principal: COME ON, SETTLE.

34:56.795 --> 35:00.729
I URGE YOU TO KEEP IN MIND
THAT THE POLICE HAVE NOT
NAMED A SUSPECT,

35:00.729 --> 35:03.372
SO PLEASE STOP SPREADING
UNFOUNDED ACCUSATIONS
AGAINST YOUR PEERS.

35:06.535 --> 35:08.177
SORRY TO INTERRUPT,
PRINCIPAL.

35:08.177 --> 35:10.709
( door closes )

35:10.709 --> 35:12.381
DANNY DESAI?

35:14.683 --> 35:16.545
WE'D LIKE YOU TO
COME WITH US, DANNY.

35:16.545 --> 35:17.716
I NEED TO ASK YOU
A FEW QUESTIONS.

35:17.716 --> 35:19.348
DAD.

35:19.348 --> 35:20.689
IN FRONT OF
THE WHOLE SCHOOL?

35:20.689 --> 35:23.892
I'M SORRY, HONEY.
DANNY, LET'S GO.

35:23.892 --> 35:25.754
( students muttering )

35:30.559 --> 35:31.730
I KNOW THAT
WE'RE ALL SCARED.

35:36.665 --> 35:39.208
AND SAD...

35:39.208 --> 35:40.709
AND, UM...

35:40.709 --> 35:43.412
ANGRY.

35:43.412 --> 35:45.274
AND IT'S EASY TO FOCUS
ALL OF THAT

35:45.274 --> 35:47.145
ON THE OBVIOUS PERSON,

35:47.145 --> 35:48.717
BUT IS THAT REALLY FAIR?

35:50.779 --> 35:53.552
I DON'T KNOW IF DANNY
DID THIS OR NOT.

35:53.552 --> 35:56.485
BUT DO YOU?

35:56.485 --> 35:58.657
DO ANY OF US?

35:58.657 --> 36:00.429
I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE
HE'S UNDER ARREST, RIGHT?

36:03.362 --> 36:04.693
PLEASE JUST--

36:04.693 --> 36:06.235
JUST GIVE HIM A CHANCE.

36:06.235 --> 36:08.497
DON'T OSTRACIZE HIM
EVEN MORE.

36:08.497 --> 36:10.599
( students chatter, chuckle )

36:15.574 --> 36:18.707
WELL, THIS IS GONNA DO WONDERS
FOR OUR SOCIAL LIVES, HUH?

36:29.218 --> 36:30.689
( door closes )

36:42.501 --> 36:43.632
I KNOW YOU AGREE WITH ME.

36:43.632 --> 36:45.374
I SAW YOUR FACE
WHILE I WAS TALKING.

36:45.374 --> 36:46.575
THAT WASN'T MY
AGREEMENT FACE.

36:46.575 --> 36:48.307
THAT WAS MY "WHAT THE HELL
IS SHE THINKING" FACE.

36:48.307 --> 36:50.839
WHAT IF SOMEONE ELSE DID
HAVE A REASON TO KILL REGINA?

36:50.839 --> 36:52.381
I MEAN, WOULDN'T
THE DAY DANNY GOT BACK

36:52.381 --> 36:53.642
BE THE PERFECT
TIME TO DO IT?

36:53.642 --> 36:56.515
HE'S THE INSTANT
SUSPECT.

36:56.515 --> 36:58.347
COME ON, LACEY.

36:58.347 --> 37:00.389
SOMEONE HAS TO GIVE HIM
THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT.

37:00.389 --> 37:01.550
AND THAT SOMEONE
HAS TO BE YOU?

37:01.550 --> 37:03.692
NO, US.
WHO ELSE IS GONNA DO IT?

37:06.355 --> 37:09.498
I KNOW ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

37:09.498 --> 37:11.660
NOTHING HAPPENED.

37:13.302 --> 37:14.533
PLEASE DON'T TELL ANYONE.

37:14.533 --> 37:16.635
I WON'T BECAUSE YOU
HAVE TO TELL EVERYONE.

37:16.635 --> 37:18.507
IF YOU SAY
YOU WERE WITH HIM,

37:18.507 --> 37:21.610
- PEOPLE WILL BELIEVE YOU.
- I WAS ASLEEP.

37:21.610 --> 37:25.374
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE DID
OR DIDN'T DO LAST NIGHT.

37:25.374 --> 37:27.616
ALL I KNOW IS THE BEST FRIEND
I EVER HAD IS DEAD.

37:30.519 --> 37:32.381
I KNOW.

37:32.381 --> 37:35.584
AND I AM SO SORRY.

37:38.287 --> 37:39.388
BUT DANNY WAS
TRYING TO START OVER.

37:39.388 --> 37:40.589
I MEAN,
WHY WOULD HE DO THIS?

37:40.589 --> 37:42.431
WHY'D HE DO IT BEFORE?

37:44.633 --> 37:47.636
JUST TRUST THE POLICE, OKAY?
TRUST YOUR DAD.

37:47.636 --> 37:50.038
IF DANNY'S INNOCENT,
THEY'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

37:50.038 --> 37:51.770
AND STOP DEFENDING HIM.

37:51.770 --> 37:54.673
YOU'RE ONLY MAKING THINGS
WORSE FOR YOURSELF HERE.

37:56.505 --> 37:58.377
( chuckles )

37:58.377 --> 37:59.448
YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED.

38:00.879 --> 38:03.552
ALL YOU CARE ABOUT IS WHAT
OTHER PEOPLE THINK OF YOU.

38:06.555 --> 38:08.717
I SWEAR, I GOT THE TEXT,
I TURNED OFF MY PHONE,

38:08.717 --> 38:09.858
THEN WENT TO BED.

38:09.858 --> 38:10.919
AND YOU DIDN'T
WANT TO TALK TO HER

38:10.919 --> 38:12.391
JUST TO FIND OUT
WHAT THE HELL SHE MEANT?

38:13.522 --> 38:15.394
I KNEW WHAT SHE MEANT.
SHE WANTED TO GET ME INTO BED.

38:15.394 --> 38:16.725
AND YOU DIDN'T GO?

38:16.725 --> 38:19.628
I GUESS I'M SAVING MYSELF
FOR SOMEONE SPECIAL, SIR.

38:21.730 --> 38:23.071
DANNY,

38:23.071 --> 38:25.404
THE PEOPLE IN THIS TOWN
DON'T CARE ABOUT THE TRUTH.

38:25.404 --> 38:27.506
ALL THEY CARE ABOUT
IS YOUR HEAD ON A STICK.

38:27.506 --> 38:30.509
BUT ME, I JUST WANT TO HEAR
YOUR SIDE OF THE STORY.

38:30.509 --> 38:31.810
SO TELL ME,
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED?

38:31.810 --> 38:33.512
NOTHING.

38:33.512 --> 38:35.514
NOTHING HAPPENED.

38:35.514 --> 38:37.386
I DIDN'T LEAVE MY ROOM
AFTER 12:30.

38:37.386 --> 38:38.987
ANYONE WHO CAN
VOUCH FOR THAT?

38:48.397 --> 38:51.029
THAT NECKLACE
LOOK FAMILIAR?

38:51.029 --> 38:52.961
Danny:
NOPE.

38:52.961 --> 38:54.002
NOT AT ALL.

38:55.103 --> 38:56.104
WHY?

38:59.408 --> 39:01.540
HOUSEKEEPER CLAIMS THAT
REGINA NEVER TOOK IT OFF,

39:01.540 --> 39:02.771
YET IT WAS THE ONLY
THING THAT WAS MISSING

39:02.771 --> 39:03.772
IN THE ENTIRE HOUSE.

39:03.772 --> 39:05.614
I'M NOT A DETECTIVE,

39:05.614 --> 39:07.115
BUT THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A BURGLARY GONE WRONG.

39:07.115 --> 39:09.848
Chief, Karen Desai
and her lawyers are here.

39:09.848 --> 39:12.020
( sighs )

39:12.020 --> 39:15.554
LOOKS LIKE WE'LL HAVE TO
FINISH THIS UP ANOTHER TIME.

39:16.525 --> 39:18.527
SURE.
ANYTHING I CAN DO TO HELP.

39:25.534 --> 39:26.565
DANNY, ARE YOU OKAY?

39:31.540 --> 39:33.472
I HOPE YOU DIDN'T
CATCH TOO MUCH GRIEF

39:33.472 --> 39:34.743
FOR THAT LITTLE SPEECH.

39:34.743 --> 39:37.876
YOU STOOD UP FOR ME.
I WAS JUST RETURNING
THE FAVOR.

39:37.876 --> 39:41.049
LOOK, REGINA TEXTED ME

39:41.049 --> 39:42.611
BEFORE SHE--

39:42.611 --> 39:44.453
YOU MEAN,
AFTER WE LEFT THE PARTY?

39:44.453 --> 39:45.884
SHE WANTED ME
TO COME BACK.

39:45.884 --> 39:48.417
AND WHEN I SAID NO,

39:48.417 --> 39:50.719
SHE INSINUATED
THAT SHE KNEW WHY
I KILLED MY AUNT.

39:50.719 --> 39:52.060
( gasps )

39:52.060 --> 39:53.522
I SHOULD HAVE
TOLD YOU BEFORE,

39:53.522 --> 39:54.993
BUT I WAS AFRAID
THAT YOU'D ASSUME
I'D KILLED HER

39:54.993 --> 39:56.695
JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.
JO, PLEASE, PLEASE.

39:58.527 --> 39:59.868
WHY DID YOU KILL HER?

39:59.868 --> 40:01.600
- I DIDN'T.
- NOT REGINA, YOUR AUNT.

40:01.600 --> 40:03.602
AND DON'T JUST SAY
THAT YOU CAN'T TELL ME.

40:03.602 --> 40:04.733
OKAY? I HAVE TO KNOW.

40:04.733 --> 40:06.004
I'M SORRY.
I'M PROTECTING YOU.

40:06.004 --> 40:07.536
FROM WHAT?
I MEAN, YOU WANT THIS

40:07.536 --> 40:10.178
SECOND CHANCE, DANNY,
BUT YOU MAKE IT SO

40:10.178 --> 40:13.081
FREAKING DIFFICULT
BY ACTING ALL WEIRD
AND MYSTERIOUS.

40:13.081 --> 40:15.413
IF YOU JUST TELL EVERYONE
WHY YOU DID IT--

40:15.413 --> 40:16.545
THEN WHAT?

40:16.545 --> 40:18.587
THEY'LL GET OVER IT?

40:18.587 --> 40:20.018
THEY'LL LAUGH IT OFF?

40:20.018 --> 40:21.550
NO.

40:21.550 --> 40:23.792
BUT MAYBE THEY WON'T
CALL YOU "SOCIO" ANYMORE.

40:23.792 --> 40:27.425
WELL, I CAN
LIVE WITH THAT.

40:27.425 --> 40:29.057
IT'S KIND OF A COOL
INTIMIDATING NICKNAME.

40:29.057 --> 40:33.632
PLEASE, JO,
LOOK AT ME.

40:33.632 --> 40:35.534
I NEED YOU TO TRUST ME.

40:37.536 --> 40:38.867
I MAY HAVE KILLED
SOMEONE BEFORE,

40:38.867 --> 40:39.868
BUT I NEVER LIED TO YOU.

40:47.676 --> 40:48.677
( knocking on door )

40:52.881 --> 40:54.553
CAN I COME IN?

40:54.553 --> 40:56.224
YEAH.

41:03.892 --> 41:05.734
( chuckles )

41:05.734 --> 41:08.567
I HAD TO BRIBE YOU BOTH
TO POSE FOR THAT PHOTO.

41:10.869 --> 41:13.902
DANNY, I WANT TO KNOW
WHAT KYLE MASTERSON
ASKED YOU TODAY.

41:15.203 --> 41:17.245
WELL, UM...

41:17.245 --> 41:19.878
HE'S REPAINTING HIS OFFICE
AND HE WANTED A SECOND OPINION.

41:19.878 --> 41:22.651
I TOLD HIM THAT GREEN
WOULD REALLY BRING OUT
HIS EYES.

41:22.651 --> 41:25.213
WOULD YOU STOP IT?

41:25.213 --> 41:28.216
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
WHY WON'T YOU TALK TO ME?

41:28.216 --> 41:29.658
ALL I WANT TO DO
IS HELP YOU.

41:29.658 --> 41:31.560
IS THAT WHY YOU
BROUGHT ME BACK
TO A TOWN

41:31.560 --> 41:33.191
WHERE EVERYONE THINKS
I'M A TEENAGE TED BUNDY?

41:33.191 --> 41:36.565
THIS IS OUR HOME.
THIS IS WHERE YOUR FATHER
AND I RAISED YOU.

41:36.565 --> 41:38.226
- IT'S WHERE WE
WERE A FAMILY.
- NO.

41:38.226 --> 41:41.229
THIS IS WHERE YOU WERE
THE TOP OF A SMALL TOWN
PYRAMID.

41:41.229 --> 41:43.572
THE MOST POPULAR
MOM IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

41:43.572 --> 41:45.233
( groans )

41:47.776 --> 41:49.908
WE COULDN'T SELL IT.

41:53.912 --> 41:58.547
WE COULDN'T EVEN
GET PEOPLE TO COME
TO THE OPEN HOUSE.

41:58.547 --> 42:00.218
WE STILL THOUGHT
ABOUT LEAVING HERE.

42:00.218 --> 42:02.551
BUT THEN YOUR FATHER'S
DRINKING GOT WORSE

42:02.551 --> 42:05.223
AND HE GAMBLED ON
SOME BAD INVESTMENTS,

42:05.223 --> 42:07.896
AND... YOU KNOW.

42:07.896 --> 42:09.798
WE DIDN'T HAVE
AS MANY OPTIONS.

42:11.730 --> 42:13.531
ARE YOU SAYING
THAT WE'RE BROKE?

42:13.531 --> 42:15.564
WE'LL BE OKAY.

42:15.564 --> 42:16.905
WE HAVE ENOUGH
TO LIVE ON.

42:18.907 --> 42:21.570
BUT THE MAJORITY OF THE MONEY
IS TIED UP IN THE HOUSE.

42:21.570 --> 42:23.742
DANNY,

42:23.742 --> 42:25.714
I LOVE YOU.

42:25.714 --> 42:27.315
I WANT YOU HAPPY.
AND IF THAT MEANS

42:27.315 --> 42:28.777
WE HAVE TO MOVE SOMEWHERE ELSE
AND START ALL OVER,

42:28.777 --> 42:30.178
THEN THAT'S
WHAT WE'LL DO.

42:30.178 --> 42:32.921
I HAVEN'T BRUSHED UP ON
MY CRIMINAL LAW LATELY,

42:32.921 --> 42:35.253
BUT I THINK THAT
FLEEING TOWN

42:35.253 --> 42:37.025
MIGHT MAKE ME
LOOK GUILTY.

42:37.025 --> 42:38.887
I DON'T CARE
HOW IT LOOKS.

42:38.887 --> 42:40.629
I KNOW YOU ARE NOT GUILTY.

42:40.629 --> 42:42.090
THANKS, MOTHER.

42:44.562 --> 42:46.895
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

42:46.895 --> 42:48.637
ONCE THEY FIND
THE REAL KILLER,

42:48.637 --> 42:50.568
THIS WILL ALL
BLOW OVER ANYWAY, RIGHT?

42:52.570 --> 42:54.903
GET SOME SLEEP.

42:54.903 --> 42:56.574
YOU'VE HAD
A REALLY LONG DAY.

42:56.574 --> 42:58.747
WE'LL TALK TOMORROW.

42:58.747 --> 42:59.748
GOOD NIGHT.
