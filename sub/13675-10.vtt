00:10.219 --> 00:11.959
Thought y'all would never show.

00:14.640 --> 00:17.052
Fire department said it started in the front.

00:17.143 --> 00:18.553
Yeah, I'd agree with that.

00:18.644 --> 00:21.101
Pour patterns on the floor look like gasoline.

00:22.231 --> 00:23.846
I know who did it.

00:23.941 --> 00:25.272
I can't prove it, but I do.

00:25.359 --> 00:28.396
-You give them a name?
-I don't have a name, just a face.

00:28.613 --> 00:30.524
Well, unless someone turns him in
or comes fon/vard...

00:30.615 --> 00:32.947
-Yeah, that ain't gonna happen.
-(CHUCKLES)

00:33.034 --> 00:35.776
I made lists. Inventory, equipment and such.

00:37.038 --> 00:39.120
When was the last time
you had an inspection from the city?

00:39.207 --> 00:41.243
Honestly? Don't remember.

00:42.293 --> 00:45.535
Well, before Katrina, I guess. I'm not sure.

00:45.630 --> 00:47.495
That's the upstairs, Miss LaDee.

00:47.590 --> 00:48.875
You want me to do down here now?

00:48.966 --> 00:51.002
Yes, please, John. Thank you, baby.

00:51.344 --> 00:52.880
Last inspection, were you up to code?

00:52.970 --> 00:54.926
Oh, no idea.

00:55.014 --> 00:56.129
You cooked in here?

00:56.224 --> 00:57.304
Red beans and rice.

00:59.101 --> 01:01.387
Look, a lot of what we had
was grandfathered in.

01:01.520 --> 01:03.897
Besides, what difference does it make?

01:03.981 --> 01:08.190
You can't blame this on faulty wiring
or I left a hot plate on.

01:08.486 --> 01:09.817
Miss Williams, we'll be in touch.

01:10.821 --> 01:11.810

Oh, l'ma call you, Mr. Cooper.

01:38.557 --> 01:42.266
You can't say I had noise complaints
the past couple of weeks.

You had some bad luck, so I don't get paid?

04:07.081 --> 04:09.538
-You're a piece of shit.
-Me?

04:09.750 --> 04:11.081
And a coward.

04:11.168 --> 04:12.999
And I'll be on the back lot without my rank,

04:13.254 --> 04:15.620
in case you find balls enough
to argue the point.

04:17.174 --> 04:20.166
MAN: You'll still get the reward
if the information leads...

04:20.261 --> 04:24.800

and I'm the fucking bad guy?

(WHISPERS) Oh, Jesus.

05:15.232 --> 05:17.188
Lieutenant, I think maybe we should...

05:33.751 --> 05:34.740
Fuck you.

05:37.671 --> 05:41.414
You know, folks, if it's one thing positive
we can take away from this storm,

05:41.509 --> 05:43.670
or rather I should say, the federal flood,

05:43.886 --> 05:46.298
is that it taught us that
the musical culture of New Orleans

05:46.388 --> 05:48.845
is our greatest asset, maybe our only asset.

05:48.933 --> 05:51.515
When all else fails, and all else did fail,

05:51.810 --> 05:55.223
we can rely on the past
musical conspiracy that is New Orleans

05:55.314 --> 05:57.396
to step the hell up. And by that I mean

05:57.608 --> 05:59.599
we pulled together and got it done, right?

05:59.693 --> 06:02.400
All for one, one for all, right? Right?

06:03.656 --> 06:06.147
(SINGING) Ha-ha, this is dedicated

06:06.617 --> 06:09.029
To all the motherfuckers that said
I couldn't make it

06:09.119 --> 06:11.531
So I start my tale with the band renowned

06:11.622 --> 06:14.739
Brassy Knoll by name
Eight men, no clowns

06:14.833 --> 06:17.119
Bringing you hot music that ain't no junk

06:17.211 --> 06:19.702
It was the best thing going
since the uncut funk

06:19.922 --> 06:22.538
So I put in my money and I put in my time

06:22.633 --> 06:25.215
And I poured out my soul
in the rhythm and rhyme

06:25.302 --> 06:28.009
And just when the booking
and the crowds start flowing

06:28.097 --> 06:30.554
Them usurping bastards
started acting like they knowin'

06:30.641 --> 06:33.303
Telling me to back off
And I gotta front less

06:33.394 --> 06:36.056
And calliope can flow
But man, you gotta confess

06:36.146 --> 06:38.637
That he ain't got
the politics that I can bring

06:38.732 --> 06:40.939
And the tats are a bit much
And he sure can't sing

06:41.026 --> 06:42.015
What?

06:42.111 --> 06:43.942
They get to soon thinking
I ain't fit for command

06:44.029 --> 06:46.771
The artistic direction of my very own band

06:46.865 --> 06:49.402
So I find it untenable, this position

06:49.493 --> 06:52.155
You out there runnin'
your sedition commission

06:52.246 --> 06:54.737
Thinking you can tell me
what the band's about

06:54.832 --> 06:57.539
But, you know
Fuck that dumb shit, man, I'm out

06:57.626 --> 06:59.082

07:27.239 --> 07:28.900
it's not gonna be played on the radio.

-NOPD?
-Mmm-hmm.

your good friend Collington.

14:40.964 --> 14:43.546

for them to keep looking the other way.

14:51.558 --> 14:53.594

the Soul Apostles back together

Thing is, it's running smack into Jazz Fest,

15:12.245 --> 15:14.861

of everybody's schedules and shit.

15:15.165 --> 15:17.827
Right now I'm thinking the Monday before.

15:17.918 --> 15:19.249

-Big Chief?
-Mmm-hmm.

15:22.547 --> 15:23.878
Not onstage.

16:20.438 --> 16:22.599
Dear God, no. Jazz brunch?

16:22.691 --> 16:25.228
12% food cost. 28 bucks for two eggs,

16:25.318 --> 16:27.183
a tablespoon of hollandaise, and a mimosa.

16:27.279 --> 16:28.815

Tim, we're still working out the kinks.

16:33.410 --> 16:34.695
I don't want to do that to the crew.

16:34.786 --> 16:36.777
They work Saturday night,
getting their asses kicked

16:36.913 --> 16:38.904
so they can wake up Sunday and cook eggs?

16:38.999 --> 16:41.706
So hire a brunch crew.
I'll send over some Hondurans.

16:41.793 --> 16:42.828
They love eggs.

16:43.378 --> 16:46.916
Look, it'll subsidize all the caviar and
truffle you want to put on the dinner menu

16:47.007 --> 16:48.963
and it'll still cover our food cost by a mile.

16:49.050 --> 16:51.541
I thought you didn't care about food cost,
not for, what was it, a year?

16:51.636 --> 16:55.754
I don't, but Chef, it's free money for nothing.

16:56.099 --> 16:57.179
Think about it, okay?

16:57.267 --> 16:59.474
I'll think about it a year from now.

16:59.561 --> 17:03.179
Which reminds me,
I am taking the crawfish ravioli off the menu.

17:03.273 --> 17:04.388

to be the Old Spaghetti Factory.

Not only is it killing us in the kitchen,

17:12.073 --> 17:13.654
we're coming to the end
of the season anyway.

17:13.742 --> 17:16.779
It's our most popular item.
I can get it for you frozen.

17:16.870 --> 17:17.859
No.

17:17.954 --> 17:21.162

ravioli coming back?"

about Danny Barker and the Fairview,

17:47.484 --> 17:49.975
the way it gets passed down.
The tradition, I mean.

17:50.612 --> 17:52.978
I was only 10 or so.

17:53.323 --> 17:55.063
Leroy Jones was already fronting that band.

17:55.158 --> 17:56.364

Same age as I was, same age as these kids.

18:09.256 --> 18:11.167
You know, I took Robert to hear Mr. Ferbos.

18:11.258 --> 18:12.998
-I know, he enjoyed it.
-Yeah.

18:13.927 --> 18:17.761
Listening to him made me realize
I still got a lot to learn about the tradition.

18:17.847 --> 18:21.431
I've been dipping my toe in this modern stuff,

18:21.518 --> 18:23.258
-trying to stretch a little.
-How's that going?

18:23.353 --> 18:25.435
I'm digging it,

18:25.522 --> 18:27.888
but, man, I don't kid myself.

18:27.983 --> 18:30.099
I believe I'm about as good
as I'm ever gonna get.

So what if I'm the seventh
best 'bone in New Orleans?

what if we got us a little Leroy Jones,

to program Congo Square, too,

18:51.089 --> 18:53.796

one of the stages inside the auditorium.

18:53.883 --> 18:56.670
And part of the renovation of
the auditorium is the gallery we talked about,

18:56.761 --> 18:58.547
the one dedicated
to the Mardi Gras Indian culture.

18:58.805 --> 19:02.172
Y'all plan to check out what Sylvester's doing
over there at the backstreet, hmm?

19:03.768 --> 19:06.020
It's across the park, right there.

19:24.873 --> 19:26.079
What about taking this fence down?

19:26.833 --> 19:28.448
We ran estimates. It's expensive.

19:28.543 --> 19:30.329
And the city has some concerns.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.376
-Concerns?
-About public safety.

19:32.464 --> 19:34.750
About black kids
from the neighborhood using the park,

19:34.883 --> 19:36.168
which is right on their front steps.

19:36.259 --> 19:39.342
That's the point. It keeps them out.
That's why it has to come down.

27:23.643 --> 27:24.632
Warned?

27:24.727 --> 27:25.887
Silby gives me the call right now,

27:25.978 --> 27:28.390
I can take your pension
for what you did to him in the back lot.

27:28.523 --> 27:29.808
And why don't you?

27:29.899 --> 27:31.435
'Cause Silby ain't a snitch.

27:35.446 --> 27:37.232
CLERK: Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth,

27:37.323 --> 27:39.735
-and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
-Mmm-hmm.

27:39.826 --> 27:41.157
Be seated.

27:49.627 --> 27:51.333
WOMAN: Mrs. Batiste-Williams,

27:51.587 --> 27:54.124
talking about this heinous event
will not be easy.

27:54.549 --> 27:57.712
If you feel you need to take a break,
we can ask the court to allow that.

27:58.719 --> 28:00.584
Let's establish a few basic facts.

28:01.180 --> 28:02.386
Are you the owner and sole...

28:03.891 --> 28:07.133
-Hey, hey.
-Mr. McAlary. What's shaking, brah?

28:07.895 --> 28:10.637
I gotta start you off with four boxes, brah.

28:17.613 --> 28:19.194
"Old Cats Who Ain't Been Paid."

28:19.282 --> 28:20.647
It's our new R&B sampler.

28:20.741 --> 28:23.448
It's local legends doing new material
on the storm.

28:23.536 --> 28:26.448
-Irma, AI Johnson, Robert Parker.
-Oh, cool.

28:26.706 --> 28:30.119
And if we sell a bunch of these,
the old guys get paid. They'll get a check.

28:30.209 --> 28:31.790
The label isn't taking its piece, so.

28:31.878 --> 28:33.288
That's beautiful, man.

28:34.213 --> 28:35.669
Are you playing on this anywhere?

28:35.756 --> 28:38.213
Uh, yeah, one track, "I Quit."

28:42.305 --> 28:43.715
(YELLS) Richard!

28:47.226 --> 28:49.558
-Richard, hey.
-Hey, what's up?

28:49.645 --> 28:50.930
Are you feeling better, man?

28:51.022 --> 28:52.603
Yeah, man, I feel great.

28:52.815 --> 28:56.979
'Cause Kermit said that you caught the flu
and couldn't make that gig in Metairie.

28:57.111 --> 28:59.602
No, man, Kermit told me
to stand down on that gig,

28:59.697 --> 29:02.029
because he needed to throw it
to somebody else.

29:21.636 --> 29:23.376
Good afternoon.

29:23.512 --> 29:25.889
There was a summary dismissal
the other night from the kitchen, I hear.

29:26.182 --> 29:27.843
He was late, second time in a week.

29:28.225 --> 29:29.931
He filed a complaint with HR.

29:31.520 --> 29:32.976
More to the point, uh,

29:33.064 --> 29:34.975
we received a complaint
from someone on the floor

29:35.066 --> 29:37.899
that you threatened her,
used inappropriate language.

29:38.694 --> 29:40.104
I managed to calm the situation.

29:40.529 --> 29:41.564
I bet.

29:42.531 --> 29:44.146
What's that supposed to mean?

29:44.659 --> 29:46.195
Everybody knows, Tim.

29:46.285 --> 29:47.525
And fuck her.

29:47.662 --> 29:49.573
Tell her to keep her prissy little ass
out of my kitchen.

29:49.664 --> 29:51.620
I think you're losing a little bit of perspective.

29:51.707 --> 29:53.413
Fuck perspective.

29:53.709 --> 29:55.745
Your obnoxious partners
and all their deadbeat friends

29:55.836 --> 29:58.043
are eating up half this dining room
every night.

29:58.506 --> 30:00.792
Your little cupcake
is overbooking the other half.

30:01.008 --> 30:04.045
She's jamming 20, 30 covers
down our throats at a time.

30:04.136 --> 30:08.049
And you want to start telling me
who can and can't be in my kitchen?

30:09.266 --> 30:11.518
There's something else we need to talk about.

30:17.274 --> 30:20.232
Okay, that's my bad.
I should have discussed it with you.

30:20.778 --> 30:23.440
It's for somebody I know. It's a sister
of someone who used to work for me.

30:23.572 --> 30:25.984
_||Gigi-II
-Yeah, that's the name of her place.

30:26.075 --> 30:27.155
She had a fire.

30:27.243 --> 30:28.278
It's our dark night anyway.

30:28.369 --> 30:29.859
We're not doing it.

30:30.746 --> 30:32.657
It won't cost us anything.

30:32.748 --> 30:34.329
I'll run it. You'll never even know it happened.

30:34.417 --> 30:36.328
We're not doing it because we can't.

30:36.585 --> 30:38.792
Our arrangement with the building
and the residences upstairs,

30:38.879 --> 30:40.790
prohibits live music after 10:00 pm.

30:40.881 --> 30:42.963
And amplified music anytime.

30:44.218 --> 30:47.210
You want to hire a piano player
and do a cocktail hour,

30:47.304 --> 30:49.716
pass a hat for your friend's sister,
knock yourself out.

31:00.818 --> 31:03.184
Once we get up and running,
I was thinking along the lines

31:03.279 --> 31:05.235
of Fairview marching band, you know,

31:05.406 --> 31:07.317
a place for the kids to learn the tradition.

31:07.491 --> 31:08.947
Sounds great, Antoine.

31:09.035 --> 31:11.777
Really need something
for the kids who ain't got much else.

31:11.871 --> 31:13.407
Like Cherise, you know?

31:14.540 --> 31:15.655
Jennifer, too.

31:15.750 --> 31:19.038
Can't do nothing about her not reading,
nothing at all.

31:19.128 --> 31:21.119
But at least with this,

31:22.339 --> 31:24.079
she got a chance...

31:24.425 --> 31:26.837
-Where are you going?
-Down to Canal.

31:26.927 --> 31:29.794
Gonna jump all over that award thing
they're doing for Nagin.

31:29.889 --> 31:31.720
"Excellence in recovery," my ass.

31:31.807 --> 31:33.217
Oh, yeah.

31:33.309 --> 31:35.550
-Slap him one for me.
-Mmm-hmm.

31:36.854 --> 31:39.311
And don't you get arrested this time.

31:41.400 --> 31:42.515
Shit.

31:47.656 --> 31:50.272
So, what did the police tell you?

31:51.160 --> 31:52.240
They told me nothing.

31:52.328 --> 31:56.571
Said Glover was never ruled a homicide
and that I should talk to the coroner about it.

31:59.627 --> 32:00.992
Which I did,

32:01.629 --> 32:03.119
many months ago.

32:05.007 --> 32:06.998
You know they still ain't never paid me
for my car?

32:09.678 --> 32:11.839
I'm sorry, brah. I can't help you with that.

32:11.931 --> 32:14.013
Maybe you can write a follow-up on that.

32:16.477 --> 32:17.887
Maybe.

32:25.736 --> 32:28.193

-He might already be inside.

33:06.986 --> 33:08.977
Do you even see any of the reports?

33:09.655 --> 33:11.111
Does any of it come through homicide?

33:11.198 --> 33:12.358
There's no reports.

33:13.742 --> 33:16.905
Defillo doesn't require
anything to be written down.

-What about you?
-Me?

33:23.294 --> 33:24.500
Mmm-hmm.

33:25.421 --> 33:27.252
They told me to quit.

33:29.550 --> 33:30.835
Will you?

33:31.427 --> 33:32.712
I might.

33:36.307 --> 33:38.548
I'm getting eaten alive out here.

33:40.144 --> 33:42.305
-Want to go inside?
-Oh, no. No, no, no.

33:42.396 --> 33:44.136
You don't... No.

33:44.815 --> 33:48.228
No, the big mosquitoes,
they're all up in the corners of the trailer,

33:48.319 --> 33:49.525
guarding their eggs.

33:49.612 --> 33:51.068
It's much safer out here, trust me.

with your uncle Ronald,

-give me the inside tour.
-I got you, man. No problem.

jazz center cats and Irvin to check it out.

-Yeah.

Can't wait to see the look on his face.

If he doesn't, we will.

36:09.126 --> 36:10.332
What do you think he'll say about our story?

36:10.419 --> 36:11.625
That it's entirely accurate

36:11.712 --> 36:14.203
and that the city should be ashamed
of what's happened.

44:19.783 --> 44:22.616

I won't have a job.

44:23.954 --> 44:26.411

-Work.

44:26.665 --> 44:28.246
Hear any music?

44:28.750 --> 44:30.081
Some metal.

44:31.253 --> 44:32.743

Huh?

52:58.926 --> 53:00.052
I don't know where he went.

53:01.763 --> 53:03.344
All right, I'll be right back.

53:04.057 --> 53:05.547
That was great, man, just great.

-All right.

53:17.612 --> 53:19.102
I'm not sure if I can give this up.

53:19.572 --> 53:21.073
I never asked you to.

53:52.605 --> 53:54.266
Thank you so, so much for doing this.

53:57.068 --> 53:58.274
Yeah, I hope so.

53:58.903 --> 54:00.188
See you.

54:00.279 --> 54:01.655
See you, Chef.

54:03.157 --> 54:04.863
Saw you on the news the other night.

54:06.035 --> 54:08.367
So the mayor's friend wants to
make up an award and give it to him.

54:08.454 --> 54:09.534
Who cares?

54:11.582 --> 54:13.994
You gonna see Liguori any time soon?

54:16.003 --> 54:17.994
Give him this for me, will you?

54:25.930 --> 54:28.091
Who the fuck gives back a consulting fee?

54:28.808 --> 54:30.469
I mean, seriously.

54:38.484 --> 54:41.442
When you first called, I thought
you wanted to talk about Henry Glover.

54:41.529 --> 54:43.360
You see that fellow's article?

54:43.448 --> 54:44.733
TONI: Idid.

54:44.824 --> 54:46.906
I helped him where I could, in fact.

54:46.993 --> 54:48.949
Hell of ajob he did. You see him,

54:49.579 --> 54:51.945
you tell him he has a fan in this field office.

54:52.039 --> 54:54.701
I wanted to tell him myself,
but I didn't want to spook him.

54:57.170 --> 54:58.876
And besides, I can't afford to be quoted,

54:59.338 --> 55:01.545
regulations and all. Still...

55:02.175 --> 55:03.790
That was Henry Glover.

55:03.885 --> 55:05.876
Today, this is Joseph Abreu.

55:06.888 --> 55:08.128
Of course. Sir.

55:08.222 --> 55:12.465
Yeah, hi. I came down here
more than a year ago, looking for answers.

55:13.311 --> 55:15.017
Now that I know what happened,

55:15.104 --> 55:16.719
the question is,

55:16.814 --> 55:18.554
what the hell is anybody gonna do about it?

55:18.649 --> 55:20.685
Well, I'm very interested in your son's death.

55:20.776 --> 55:21.765
That's why I'm here.

55:21.903 --> 55:23.894
Yeah, but you ain't doing nothing.

55:24.697 --> 55:28.030
And if it wasn't for this lady,
I still wouldn't know what happened to Joey.

55:28.117 --> 55:30.529
And now she's got a witness.

55:31.204 --> 55:32.819
I'd be very happy to meet with him.

55:32.914 --> 55:34.529
This man lost his son.

55:34.624 --> 55:38.333
And we now know that the New Orleans
Police Department is responsible,

55:38.419 --> 55:41.161
just like they're responsible
in the death of Henry Glover,

55:41.255 --> 55:43.507
and those people shot
on the Danziger Bridge,

55:43.591 --> 55:45.001
and Raymond Robair,

55:45.092 --> 55:47.174
and Danny Brumfield
and who knows how many more.

55:47.261 --> 55:49.843
And the state is prosecuting
the Danziger case.

55:49.931 --> 55:51.262
And making a mess of it.

55:51.766 --> 55:53.631
From what I hear, it's about to collapse.

55:53.726 --> 55:56.058
It's almost three years since the storm

55:56.145 --> 55:59.637
and no one has so much
as opened a real file on Joey Abreu.

56:01.150 --> 56:02.856
So before I give you the name of a man

56:02.944 --> 56:06.903
who saw a New Orleans police officer
murder his son,

56:07.365 --> 56:09.276
I'd like you to look Mr. Abreu in the eye

56:09.367 --> 56:12.905
and promise him that you intend
to take this case where the evidence leads.

56:12.995 --> 56:14.075
I can only do what I can do.

56:14.163 --> 56:17.530
TONI: That regardless of who wins
the next fucking election,

56:18.125 --> 56:21.162
that you will bring
a civil rights case on this death

56:21.295 --> 56:22.956
if the evidence warrants it.

56:26.759 --> 56:28.715
If the evidence is there

56:29.136 --> 56:31.127
and DOJ won't move on it,

56:32.640 --> 56:33.971
I'll quit.

56:35.810 --> 56:37.425
I promise you that.

ask your permission to use my own name.

Let me explain something to you, Chef.

58:39.058 --> 58:41.891
This restaurant goes on
with you or without you.

58:42.103 --> 58:45.015
That name on the door stays on the door
as long as I want it to,

58:45.106 --> 58:46.937
whether you're here, whether you're involved.

58:47.024 --> 58:50.357
Who gets hurt when you walk out that door?
Not me. We go on.

58:50.444 --> 58:52.309
What happens to you, do you think?

58:52.947 --> 58:54.653
Don't fuck with me, Chef.

Look, if something like they're talking about
gets built, that's major.

59:18.389 --> 59:21.802
They've been talking about
building some jazz thing since I was a kid.

59:21.976 --> 59:23.967
That ain't never gonna happen.

59:24.061 --> 59:27.224
The storm changed some things, Chief,
made some things possible.

59:27.314 --> 59:29.726
There's money here to rebuild,
money that wasn't here before.

59:29.817 --> 59:31.648
And everybodyjumps.

59:31.736 --> 59:33.727
Don't be so quick to run down the money.

59:33.821 --> 59:35.777
Nothing happens without it.

59:35.990 --> 59:37.946
I ain't running down the money,

59:38.033 --> 59:42.276
but when people start thinking
that money is the fucking answer,

59:42.371 --> 59:44.908
then you get a whole 'nother set of problems.

59:45.791 --> 59:47.747

59:47.835 --> 59:50.167
not the New Orleans I know, anyway.
