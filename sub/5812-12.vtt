WEBVTT

00:04.497 --> 00:07.165
LIZ:<i> We started</i>
<i> with such high hopes.</i>

00:07.167 --> 00:09.467
<i> With all the previous owners</i>
<i> being dead,</i>

00:09.469 --> 00:13.304
<i> the hotel was</i>
<i> under new management-- ours.</i>

00:13.306 --> 00:15.606
<i> We were determined</i>
<i> to remake the Cortez</i>

00:15.608 --> 00:17.809
<i> in our own image.</i>

00:17.811 --> 00:19.944
<i> This would be no mere hotel.</i>

00:19.946 --> 00:22.747
<i> We had ambitions to be</i>
<i> a family to the friendless,</i>

00:22.749 --> 00:24.916
<i>a comfort to those in the cold,</i>

00:24.918 --> 00:28.252
<i> a beehive of acceptance.</i>

00:28.254 --> 00:31.422
<i> It was supposed to be</i>
<i> the perfect ending.</i>

00:40.867 --> 00:43.601
Oh, hello.
Hello.

00:43.603 --> 00:45.703
Welcome to
the Cortez.

00:45.705 --> 00:47.839
Please, sign our guest book.

00:47.841 --> 00:49.307
Sure.

00:49.309 --> 00:51.476
May I offer the two of you
a glass of champagne?

00:51.478 --> 00:52.877
Ooh.
Don't mind if I do.

00:52.879 --> 00:54.846
Ah.

00:56.316 --> 00:58.116
(whispering): I think
those are the reviewers

00:58.118 --> 01:00.518
from that Internet site,
Trip Adventurers.

01:00.520 --> 01:02.954
They must've heard about
our grand reopening.

01:02.956 --> 01:04.522
I know.

01:04.524 --> 01:06.958
Can't you see
the ridiculously gracious smile

01:06.960 --> 01:08.926
plastered on my face?

01:12.532 --> 01:14.298
What is that pungent odor?

01:14.300 --> 01:17.368
Sage. To cleanse the spirit.

01:18.238 --> 01:19.704
I'll show you
to your room.

01:19.706 --> 01:21.305
(elevator bell dings)

01:21.307 --> 01:23.674
LIZ:<i> To polish the jewel</i>
<i> that is the Cortez,</i>

01:23.676 --> 01:26.544
<i> it required not only money--</i>
<i> which we got from liquidating</i>

01:26.546 --> 01:29.313
<i> the Countess's</i>
<i> numerous pieces of art--</i>

01:29.315 --> 01:32.683
<i> it was going to take</i>
<i> four stars on the Internet.</i>

01:32.685 --> 01:35.553
<i> And so, we were off.</i>

01:39.559 --> 01:44.228
We haven't finished with
every floor, but this is one of

01:44.230 --> 01:45.596
our newly
refreshed rooms.

01:45.598 --> 01:46.998
Egyptian cotton.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.099
400 thread count.

01:48.101 --> 01:50.101
Minibar?

01:50.103 --> 01:51.436
Mixers are on the house.

01:51.438 --> 01:52.904
If there's
anything else you need,

01:52.906 --> 01:54.405
just pick up
the phone.

01:54.407 --> 01:55.940
Thank you.

01:55.942 --> 01:57.575
Enjoy your stay.

01:59.045 --> 02:01.212
And you were ready
to give it a pass.

02:01.214 --> 02:03.681
Kill me.

02:03.683 --> 02:04.916
(chuckles)

02:04.918 --> 02:06.184
(gasps)

02:06.186 --> 02:07.552
Are you kidding?

02:07.554 --> 02:10.621
That's a Toto Neorest 700H,
baby.

02:10.623 --> 02:12.390
The Japanese self-cleaning
wonder toilet.

02:12.392 --> 02:13.758
(sighs):
Oh.

02:13.760 --> 02:15.026
(laughs)

02:15.028 --> 02:17.595
I have always wanted
to try one of these.

02:17.597 --> 02:21.065
SALLY: Doesn't it just make
you want to take a dump?

02:21.067 --> 02:22.400
Who the hell are you?

02:22.402 --> 02:23.901
How did you get in here?

02:23.903 --> 02:26.304
(Sally sighs)

02:26.306 --> 02:29.974
I got to say,
it's a nice room.

02:31.644 --> 02:34.645
They spent every penny they had
to change everything they could.

02:34.647 --> 02:36.080
They took out the mattresses,

02:36.082 --> 02:38.382
especially the ones
I split open.

02:38.384 --> 02:40.451
Took out the carpets,

02:40.453 --> 02:44.288
soaked through
with so many years

02:44.290 --> 02:46.791
of piss and blood.

02:48.661 --> 02:50.962
They even changed the furniture.

02:50.964 --> 02:53.898
But you know
what they couldn't take out?

02:55.902 --> 02:58.503
The pain.

02:58.505 --> 03:01.005
'Cause I'm still here.

03:01.007 --> 03:02.840
All right, I'm gonna
have to ask you to leave.

03:02.842 --> 03:04.075
Now.
Hey.

03:04.077 --> 03:05.510
Oh! God!

03:06.079 --> 03:07.845
(gasping)

03:07.847 --> 03:10.348
Oh, God! Oh, God!

03:12.118 --> 03:13.584
Call the police!

03:13.586 --> 03:16.621
Some crazy bitch
just killed my partner!

03:16.623 --> 03:17.655
Please... ah!

03:17.657 --> 03:19.457
Oh, my God. Oh!

03:19.459 --> 03:20.825
Oh, God.

03:20.827 --> 03:22.793
Please, you got to help me!

03:22.795 --> 03:25.496
No, no.
You have to help me.

03:25.498 --> 03:27.131
I'm new at this murder game,

03:27.133 --> 03:29.667
and, Jesus Christ,
is it a thrill.

03:38.678 --> 03:40.845
Ah, crap.

03:40.847 --> 03:43.948
We got another one down
at the end of the hallway.

03:43.950 --> 03:45.283
Damn it.

03:45.285 --> 03:47.018
This has got to stop.

03:47.020 --> 03:48.719
He stained
the new carpet.

03:48.721 --> 03:50.688
Yeah, we got a serious problem.

03:50.690 --> 03:52.557
The ghosts keep
killing the guests,

03:52.559 --> 03:54.926
we're gonna end up
with zero stars.

03:56.896 --> 04:00.198
It's time we had
a goddamn meeting.

04:01.201 --> 04:03.267
¶ ¶

05:13.206 --> 05:15.106
Hello!

05:15.108 --> 05:16.741
Welcome!

05:16.743 --> 05:19.410
Thank you all for coming.
MARCY:
Excuse me.

05:19.412 --> 05:21.746
My understanding is that
you two are in charge now,

05:21.748 --> 05:24.282
and I'd like to speak to you
about changing my room.

05:24.284 --> 05:26.450
LIZ:
Sweetheart, you're a ghost.

05:26.452 --> 05:29.053
You can choose
whatever room you'd like.

05:29.055 --> 05:30.888
MARCY: Well, yes,
but the problem is,

05:30.890 --> 05:32.323
after I pick a room

05:32.325 --> 05:34.992
and then settle in
with my erotica novels,

05:34.994 --> 05:36.994
I never know if a guest
is going to check in

05:36.996 --> 05:38.629
and disturb me.

05:38.631 --> 05:40.564
I know this is
Los Angeles,

05:40.566 --> 05:43.000
but I'm an old-fashioned girl
and I like my privacy.

05:43.002 --> 05:45.002
STEPHEN: I dig it when
the guests come in.

05:45.004 --> 05:46.504
It's like a free dirty movie.

05:46.506 --> 05:47.772
I'm into that amateur stuff.

05:47.774 --> 05:49.240
(chuckles)

05:49.242 --> 05:50.508
Are you three, like,
a thing now?

05:50.510 --> 05:51.575
VENDELA:
Ya.

05:51.577 --> 05:53.577
We try dating
the lumberjack,

05:53.579 --> 05:55.780
but he's a gay.

05:55.782 --> 05:57.248
IRIS: Okay, everyone,
please, listen.

05:57.250 --> 05:58.516
This is important,

05:58.518 --> 06:00.985
and it affects every
single one of you.

06:00.987 --> 06:04.121
We would like you
to stop killing the guests.

06:04.123 --> 06:05.356
(laughs)
(murmuring)

06:05.358 --> 06:06.490
LIZ:
It's not all of you,

06:06.492 --> 06:08.159
but we are trying

06:08.161 --> 06:09.593
to build something special here.

06:09.595 --> 06:12.430
A real... destination.

06:12.432 --> 06:15.299
Look, they're gonna get two
football teams down in Carson.

06:15.301 --> 06:17.268
That's 20 minutes
down the 110.

06:17.270 --> 06:18.936
This place could
be filled.

06:18.938 --> 06:20.604
But if it gets out
that people are

06:20.606 --> 06:22.273
checking in and
disappearing,

06:22.275 --> 06:25.142
then obviously,
that's bad for business.

06:25.144 --> 06:26.344
Screw you, Iris.

06:26.346 --> 06:28.979
You're the biggest
killer in this room,

06:28.981 --> 06:30.681
you bloodsucker.
IRIS:
Maybe in the past.

06:30.683 --> 06:35.286
But every drop of blood
I drink now is donated.

06:35.288 --> 06:37.121
Any murders that
go on in this hotel

06:37.123 --> 06:38.522
are done by your kind.

06:38.524 --> 06:41.125
Excuse me, but...

06:41.127 --> 06:43.027
what do you mean by "our kind"?

06:43.029 --> 06:44.695
SALLY:
Can we all just call

06:44.697 --> 06:47.865
a spade a spade and say
you're talking about Will and I?

06:49.302 --> 06:50.835
I mean, Woo is

06:50.837 --> 06:52.636
too busy munching
on Swedish fish

06:52.638 --> 06:54.372
to bother anyone.

06:54.374 --> 06:55.740
Marcy molests herself

06:55.742 --> 06:57.208
or complains all day.

06:57.210 --> 06:58.876
The lumberjack
just mopes.

06:58.878 --> 07:01.212
And that hipster couple
just trips around

07:01.214 --> 07:03.147
moaning about for kale.

07:03.149 --> 07:05.916
Will and I are
the only ones

07:05.918 --> 07:09.086
who still get off on a
little bit of true mischief.

07:09.088 --> 07:10.354
And we're not
stopping.

07:10.356 --> 07:12.323
Ending some jerk-off

07:12.325 --> 07:14.558
who wastes the air
that he breathes?

07:14.560 --> 07:16.994
That is the real high.

07:16.996 --> 07:19.897
I'm dead, but I've
never felt more alive.

07:19.899 --> 07:21.165
Ha.

07:21.167 --> 07:22.466
(slow clapping)

07:24.604 --> 07:26.036
Beautifully said.

07:26.038 --> 07:27.772
And I couldn't
agree more.

07:27.774 --> 07:30.274
But I must come down
on the side of Cleopatra

07:30.276 --> 07:32.343
and her friend on this issue.

07:32.345 --> 07:33.677
SALLY:
Oh, come on!

07:33.679 --> 07:35.713
You telling people
to stop killing

07:35.715 --> 07:38.783
is like Colonel Sanders telling
us to stop eating chicken.

07:38.785 --> 07:40.451
I'm not familiar
with your military friend

07:40.453 --> 07:42.453
and his fondness
for poultry,

07:42.455 --> 07:43.954
but my killing days
are over.

07:43.956 --> 07:45.256
I thought
the Ten Commandment killings

07:45.258 --> 07:46.690
were the beginning
of my work,

07:46.692 --> 07:48.626
but it turns out
that they are the epilogue.

07:48.628 --> 07:52.863
The torch has been passed,
and I feel complete.

07:54.100 --> 07:57.468
But this is a practical
decision, not an emotional one.

07:57.470 --> 08:00.137
This is our home.

08:00.139 --> 08:02.440
Frankly,
it's the only one we've got.

08:02.442 --> 08:04.375
None of us know
what is waiting for us

08:04.377 --> 08:06.644
beyond this place
if it no longer stands.

08:06.646 --> 08:09.447
Perhaps, without these walls
to protect us, we would all be

08:09.449 --> 08:11.048
forced to move on and face

08:11.050 --> 08:13.584
the judgment of our Maker.

08:13.586 --> 08:15.553
If we can't stay in business,
all bets are off.

08:15.555 --> 08:16.620
We'll have to sell.

08:16.622 --> 08:17.955
Or get evicted.

08:17.957 --> 08:19.223
WILL:
That's bullshit.

08:19.225 --> 08:20.791
I paid cash
for this place.

08:20.793 --> 08:22.893
My lawyers will keep
paying the upkeep and the taxes

08:22.895 --> 08:24.762
for as long
as they have the funds.

08:24.764 --> 08:27.131
Yeah, well, that's not gonna
take very long, cowboy.

08:27.133 --> 08:29.233
Sure, your business
was worth a fortune

08:29.235 --> 08:30.634
when you were alive.

08:30.636 --> 08:32.470
But you're such a narcissist

08:32.472 --> 08:35.506
that you never brought anyone
else in to design your lines.

08:35.508 --> 08:38.476
And when you disappeared,
they had zilch.

08:38.478 --> 08:40.945
Now the whole shithouse
has gone up in flames.

08:40.947 --> 08:43.013
Your stock is worth pennies.

08:43.015 --> 08:44.281
That is bullshit!

08:44.283 --> 08:45.516
You're a goddamn liar.

08:45.518 --> 08:47.184
Enough!
This is not a democracy!

08:47.186 --> 08:48.452
We are not
in the House of Lords!

08:48.454 --> 08:50.020
We are a ship at sea!

08:50.022 --> 08:52.656
And when it comes
to you spirits, I am captain!

08:52.658 --> 08:54.959
So listen up, mateys!

08:54.961 --> 08:56.961
There are six criteria

08:56.963 --> 08:59.163
that the U.S. Department
of Interior uses to determine

08:59.165 --> 09:00.998
if a place is worthy
of being called

09:01.000 --> 09:02.833
an historical landmark.

09:02.835 --> 09:04.869
This hotel fits them all.

09:04.871 --> 09:08.172
The one thing it does not
yet possess is time.

09:08.174 --> 09:10.841
Age.

09:10.843 --> 09:12.710
August 23, 2026.

09:12.712 --> 09:15.346
That will make it 100 years
that this hotel has stood.

09:15.348 --> 09:17.147
And on that day, it will earn
its rightful distinction

09:17.149 --> 09:19.850
as an historical landmark.

09:19.852 --> 09:21.685
They won't be able
to tear it down

09:21.687 --> 09:23.187
even if they
wanted to.

09:23.189 --> 09:26.824
The killing must stop!

09:26.826 --> 09:29.026
SALLY:
Oh, hell no.

09:29.028 --> 09:31.295
Some of us can't go out
into the world

09:31.297 --> 09:32.796
to find
companionship,

09:32.798 --> 09:34.698
so I'm not gonna stop
collecting souls

09:34.700 --> 09:36.400
until I find my soul mate.
MARCH:
Sally, I don't want

09:36.402 --> 09:38.335
to get rough with you,
but you and I both know

09:38.337 --> 09:39.904
there is a way to get
you to do as I please.

09:39.906 --> 09:43.007
Or do you not recall
the last time you disobeyed me?

09:43.009 --> 09:44.808
(muffled screaming,
drill whirring)

09:47.079 --> 09:48.913
So, it's settled, then.

09:52.985 --> 09:56.420
The point of being dead
is that there are no rules.

09:56.422 --> 09:58.389
It's the only salvation.

09:58.391 --> 10:00.658
Who gives a shit if they
tear this place down

10:00.660 --> 10:02.760
and send us all
straight to hell?

10:02.762 --> 10:05.329
It can't be any worse!

10:05.331 --> 10:06.397
(spits)

10:15.708 --> 10:18.909
(knocking on door)

10:18.911 --> 10:20.511
Go away!

10:22.515 --> 10:24.682
Complimentary bottle
of champagne

10:24.684 --> 10:27.685
for our VIP long-term residents.

10:27.687 --> 10:29.053
That's you, missy.

10:29.055 --> 10:31.388
Save your breath.

10:31.390 --> 10:33.290
I know what you're up to.

10:33.292 --> 10:35.793
Your Kumbaya intrigues
might work with the others;

10:35.795 --> 10:37.428
they're not gonna work with me.

10:37.430 --> 10:38.429
Good.

10:38.431 --> 10:40.431
We can cut the crap.

10:40.433 --> 10:42.900
Jesus, you're one
lonely, miserable bitch.

10:42.902 --> 10:46.270
Oh, there she is.

10:46.272 --> 10:48.439
Now get the hell
out of my room.

10:48.441 --> 10:51.208
Don't you ever get tired
of being so goddamn bitter?

10:51.210 --> 10:53.310
I want to help you, Sally.

10:53.312 --> 10:55.946
This coming from the woman
who shoved me out of a window.

10:55.948 --> 10:56.947
Okay.

10:56.949 --> 10:59.750
That's on me.

10:59.752 --> 11:02.152
I'm sorry.

11:02.154 --> 11:03.988
Truly.

11:03.990 --> 11:07.057
But it's no good for either
of us to dwell in the past.

11:08.928 --> 11:10.828
Honey, you haven't been the same
since John left.

11:10.830 --> 11:14.398
Watch it, Iris.

11:14.400 --> 11:17.868
I can still take an ice pick
to your throat, anytime.

11:27.179 --> 11:29.513
You loved him.

11:29.515 --> 11:32.650
The only way
you knew how.

11:32.652 --> 11:35.185
He turned his
back on you,

11:35.187 --> 11:38.589
after all you'd
done for him.

11:38.591 --> 11:42.092
I know how that feels.

11:42.094 --> 11:45.295
You don't know a damn thing
about how I feel.

11:45.297 --> 11:47.665
About my pain.

11:49.535 --> 11:52.536
The only thing
that takes the edge off

11:52.538 --> 11:56.306
is when I can
pull people under with me.

11:56.308 --> 12:00.511
Make them feel
one ounce of what I feel.

12:00.513 --> 12:03.213
Then I'm not alone.

12:03.215 --> 12:05.516
But don't you see?

12:05.518 --> 12:09.219
All those people you've
been killing, it's...

12:09.221 --> 12:11.355
they're just Band-Aids.

12:11.357 --> 12:15.526
What if I knew of a
more permanent fix?

12:15.528 --> 12:18.128
You could have
something long-lasting.

12:18.130 --> 12:21.131
A future.

12:21.133 --> 12:23.634
What future?

12:23.636 --> 12:25.235
I'm dead.

12:25.237 --> 12:27.871
You've been living
in a 1994 world.

12:27.873 --> 12:29.673
Times have changed.

12:29.675 --> 12:34.578
The Cortez is proud to offer
free Wi-Fi now in every room.

12:38.718 --> 12:42.052
Here's your ticket
to adventure.

12:45.691 --> 12:47.591
Go on, open it.

12:50.563 --> 12:52.763
What am I supposed
to do with this?

12:52.765 --> 12:54.531
We can't change
the past,

12:54.533 --> 12:56.600
but you can choose to
move forward and live.

12:56.602 --> 12:58.102
So what?

12:58.104 --> 13:00.104
I-I'm gonna be
the ghost in the machine?

13:00.106 --> 13:03.073
That's exactly
what you're gonna be.

13:03.075 --> 13:05.075
Okay, look.

13:05.077 --> 13:08.011
I loaded it up for you

13:08.013 --> 13:11.749
with Twitter, Instagram,

13:11.751 --> 13:13.016
Facebook. You
don't need to be

13:13.018 --> 13:15.085
out in the world
to be a part of it.

13:15.087 --> 13:18.222
In the modern age, no one
ever has to be alone.

13:18.224 --> 13:20.190
Even for a second.

13:20.192 --> 13:24.428
There's a whole world out there
waiting to embrace you, Sally.

13:24.430 --> 13:27.498
Come on, all you have
to do is dive in.

13:29.635 --> 13:31.635
(phone vibrates)

13:31.637 --> 13:33.804
¶ ¶

13:33.806 --> 13:37.174
LIZ:<i> Sally took to the interwebs</i>
<i> like a fish to water.</i>

13:38.711 --> 13:41.779
<i>It was as if everything she did</i>

13:41.781 --> 13:43.213
<i> shot out a pulse</i>
<i> of electricity.</i>

13:43.215 --> 13:45.115
<i> And from all the corners</i>
<i> of the globe,</i>

13:45.117 --> 13:46.784
<i> people responded.</i>

13:46.786 --> 13:47.785
(phone vibrates)

13:47.787 --> 13:51.588
<i> In droves, tingling for more.</i>

13:51.590 --> 13:55.959
<i> A rapt audience</i>
<i> welcoming her with open arms,</i>

13:55.961 --> 13:58.729
<i> desperate to connect,</i>
<i> hanging onto her every word.</i>

13:58.731 --> 14:02.800
<i>Suddenly the girl no one wanted</i>
<i> became the belle of the ball.</i>

14:02.802 --> 14:05.502
<i> She could say anything,</i>
<i> bare her soul.</i>

14:05.504 --> 14:08.939
<i> Her lone voice weaving into</i>
<i> its own cyber subculture.</i>

14:08.941 --> 14:11.909
<i> A safe harbor.</i>

14:11.911 --> 14:15.612
¶ It spits you out
when you desire ¶

14:15.614 --> 14:18.182
¶ Conquer it
to feel you're higher... ¶

14:18.184 --> 14:20.484
<i> As she basked</i>
<i> in sublime adoration,</i>

14:20.486 --> 14:24.521
<i> being numb to the world</i>
<i> finally lost its appeal.</i>

14:26.592 --> 14:28.659
¶ ¶

14:44.276 --> 14:45.742
Another?

14:49.481 --> 14:51.615
How long have
I been dead?

14:51.617 --> 14:53.617
It's over a year now.

14:53.619 --> 14:55.552
How long
does it feel like?

14:55.554 --> 14:59.323
Like I don't exist.

14:59.325 --> 15:04.561
Is that why you've been acting
out and killing those people?

15:04.563 --> 15:07.130
I had no idea
that my business was dead.

15:07.132 --> 15:08.899
(chuckles)

15:08.901 --> 15:11.535
Oh, it's not dead.
It's dying.

15:11.537 --> 15:13.904
Well, what have
they done with it?

15:13.906 --> 15:15.205
Factories?

15:15.207 --> 15:18.742
The stores on Rodeo,
Fifth Avenue?

15:18.744 --> 15:21.478
Well, they shuttered
the couture division.

15:21.480 --> 15:25.415
The perfumes and sunglasses are
keeping everything else afloat.

15:25.417 --> 15:27.751
And you do matter
in the world, you know.

15:27.753 --> 15:32.823
As long as it lives and
your son thrives, you matter.

15:34.827 --> 15:37.227
I'm grateful for
what you've done for him.

15:37.229 --> 15:39.997
Thatcher is one of the best
schools in the country,

15:39.999 --> 15:43.100
and Ojai is year-round divine.

15:43.102 --> 15:44.735
You should let him
come and visit you.

15:44.737 --> 15:46.703
No. No.

15:50.342 --> 15:53.377
This is no place
for a young man.

15:53.379 --> 15:54.378
(chuckles)

15:54.380 --> 15:57.114
All of the death here.

15:57.116 --> 16:00.918
I don't want him to
be poisoned by it.

16:00.920 --> 16:03.987
Even if it breaks my heart
that I can't see him.

16:06.592 --> 16:08.792
May I make a proposition?

16:08.794 --> 16:10.961
You're beautiful, but
you're not my type.

16:10.963 --> 16:12.996
(laughs)

16:15.100 --> 16:17.034
The trapped spirits
in this place

16:17.036 --> 16:20.771
who aren't in perpetual misery
understand that

16:20.773 --> 16:23.774
if you want to feel the magic
of cause and effect,

16:23.776 --> 16:25.475
you have to have a purpose.

16:25.477 --> 16:28.612
Your fashion house was iconic.

16:28.614 --> 16:30.580
You're iconic.

16:30.582 --> 16:32.282
My fashion house was
headed for disaster

16:32.284 --> 16:35.218
long before I
"disappeared."

16:35.220 --> 16:37.621
I haven't had
an original thought in a decade.

16:37.623 --> 16:39.056
This is California!

16:39.058 --> 16:42.392
The land of
reinvention.

16:42.394 --> 16:43.794
I mean,

16:43.796 --> 16:46.229
look what this place
did for me.

16:48.267 --> 16:50.167
Where does everyone
even think I am?

16:50.169 --> 16:51.601
Rumors abound.

16:51.603 --> 16:55.605
Rehab, madness, illness.

16:55.607 --> 16:58.075
Each one more scandalous
than the last.

16:58.077 --> 17:01.678
Frankly,
it's marvelous publicity.

17:01.680 --> 17:03.747
People love a mystery.

17:06.085 --> 17:08.752
Sketch.

17:08.754 --> 17:10.520
Create.

17:10.522 --> 17:12.556
Be part of the world again.

17:14.293 --> 17:17.461
Running a fashion house
is more than sketching.

17:17.463 --> 17:21.064
More than any other business,
a line needs a face.

17:27.272 --> 17:30.440
(chuckles):
Okay.

17:30.442 --> 17:34.611
I was a salesman
in another life.

17:34.613 --> 17:36.713
In this one,
I'm the mother of style.

17:36.715 --> 17:38.615
Cut me and I bleed Dior.

17:42.888 --> 17:45.122
And you don't have
to be dead, you know.

17:45.124 --> 17:47.557
So you decided to hole up
in your happy place,

17:47.559 --> 17:49.626
like Howard Hughes
without the crazy.

17:49.628 --> 17:51.461
(whispers):
We can do this!

18:06.645 --> 18:08.478
LIZ:<i> Stepping into</i>
<i> the boardroom atop a pair</i>

18:08.480 --> 18:10.213
<i> of five-inch Guccis, well,</i>

18:10.215 --> 18:12.215
<i> that teaches the authority</i>
<i> this business needed.</i>

18:12.217 --> 18:15.852
<i>You have to balance your frame,</i>
<i> consider each step,</i>

18:15.854 --> 18:17.487
<i> and lean into your momentum.</i>

18:17.489 --> 18:19.723
<i> You wind up elevated.</i>

18:19.725 --> 18:22.225
Gentlemen, I'm Liz Taylor.

18:22.227 --> 18:23.860
Mr. Drake has sent me here

18:23.862 --> 18:25.862
to lead this company
into the future.

18:25.864 --> 18:27.931
Until Mr. Drake
has the courtesy

18:27.933 --> 18:29.866
to appear before
this board himself...

18:29.868 --> 18:32.069
Mr. Vice-Chairman,
I can assure you that Will Drake

18:32.071 --> 18:34.104
has granted me full authority
to act on his behalf.

18:34.106 --> 18:35.238
Well,

18:35.240 --> 18:37.674
I don't accept
your authority.

18:37.676 --> 18:39.076
MAN: I'm afraid
you'll have to.

18:39.078 --> 18:42.345
I've met with Will Drake
at the Hotel Cortez,

18:42.347 --> 18:45.582
and it's official.

18:45.584 --> 18:47.684
Ms. Taylor here
has total authority

18:47.686 --> 18:49.586
to speak on his behalf.

18:50.689 --> 18:51.922
You're fired.

18:51.924 --> 18:53.490
(chuckles)

18:55.461 --> 19:00.597
Now, gentlemen,
I know something about rebirth.

19:00.599 --> 19:03.767
Listen and learn.

19:03.769 --> 19:05.769
WILL:
<i> No! I can't do this!</i>

19:05.771 --> 19:11.141
There's inspiration
all around us.

19:11.143 --> 19:13.210
All you got to do is look.

19:15.914 --> 19:18.615
LIZ:<i> I left Will alone</i>
<i> to work his sorcery,</i>

19:18.617 --> 19:20.984
<i> and he left me to mine.</i>

19:20.986 --> 19:22.786
¶ Nights in white satin... ¶

19:22.788 --> 19:24.921
<i>We cast his absence as mystery.</i>

19:24.923 --> 19:27.390
<i> He gave very little of himself</i>
<i> to the public,</i>

19:27.392 --> 19:29.826
<i> and demand steadily rose.</i>

19:29.828 --> 19:32.896
<i> His presentations were</i>
<i> exclusive and exotic.</i>

19:32.898 --> 19:36.800
<i> Very few invitations,</i>
<i> very unusual models.</i>

19:36.802 --> 19:39.803
<i> All cameras and phones</i>
<i> were banned,</i>

19:39.805 --> 19:41.938
<i> which only made</i>
<i> word of mouth stronger,</i>

19:41.940 --> 19:44.241
<i> interest more intense.</i>

19:44.243 --> 19:47.611

¶ 'Cause I love you ¶

20:08.333 --> 20:11.001
(chuckles)
¶ Yes, I love you... ¶

20:11.003 --> 20:14.571
It was a night like this
when I first saw Tristan.

20:19.845 --> 20:23.680
Just promise me you'll
keep an open mind.

20:23.682 --> 20:25.949
Please, remember
to whom you speak.

20:25.951 --> 20:28.418
Now, what are we doing here?

20:31.390 --> 20:33.290
I know how much
you miss Tristan.

20:33.292 --> 20:35.358
And wherever he is,
I don't know

20:35.360 --> 20:38.028
why we haven't seen
hide nor hair of him.

20:38.030 --> 20:41.031
And if anybody can reach him,

20:41.033 --> 20:43.066
this woman can.

20:43.068 --> 20:46.002
Iris...

20:46.004 --> 20:48.572
did you get me a psychic?

20:50.542 --> 20:52.042
(door opens)

20:53.679 --> 20:55.178
LIZ:
Oh.

20:55.180 --> 20:57.380
(door closes)

20:57.382 --> 21:01.218
Billie Dean Howard,
this is Liz.

21:01.220 --> 21:03.753
Liz, it is so good to meet you.

21:03.755 --> 21:06.256
(chuckles) I've seen you
on the side of a bus.

21:06.258 --> 21:07.691
(chuckles)

21:07.693 --> 21:09.392
Billie Dean has
her own show on Lifetime.

21:09.394 --> 21:11.428
She helps the bereaved
communicate with

21:11.430 --> 21:13.396
their dearly departed
loved ones.

21:13.398 --> 21:14.664
I'm impressed.

21:14.666 --> 21:16.032
I'll be honest.

21:16.034 --> 21:17.734
Your establishment
is fairly notorious

21:17.736 --> 21:21.104
among the paranormal communities
being a bit of a hot spot.

21:21.106 --> 21:22.339
(chuckles)

21:22.341 --> 21:23.506
I was thinking I might want

21:23.508 --> 21:25.175
to do an episode
of my show here.

21:25.177 --> 21:26.910
(chuckles)
But today,

21:26.912 --> 21:29.145
I am here for you.

21:44.563 --> 21:46.296
Hmm.

21:49.234 --> 21:52.569
Hmm, so many voices.

21:52.571 --> 21:54.638
It's a very noisy hotel.

22:03.949 --> 22:06.349
(faint, echoing chatter)

22:11.623 --> 22:13.990
Oh, I feel something.

22:13.992 --> 22:16.893
A very masculine energy.

22:16.895 --> 22:18.962
Restless.

22:21.433 --> 22:22.999
He's here.

22:25.971 --> 22:27.437
Spirit,

22:27.439 --> 22:31.574
we seek you with loving hearts
and open minds.

22:31.576 --> 22:36.246
Lift the veil that separates
our world from yours.

22:36.248 --> 22:38.081
Speak to us.

22:40.919 --> 22:42.519
Tristan.

22:42.521 --> 22:43.687
Hello.

22:43.689 --> 22:45.689
(gasps)

22:45.691 --> 22:48.992
Tristan,
I'm here with Liz.

22:48.994 --> 22:50.727
She misses you very much.

22:52.497 --> 22:54.764
Is there any message
you have for her?

22:58.870 --> 23:00.437
What?

23:00.439 --> 23:02.072
What does he say?

23:05.610 --> 23:08.611
He says...

23:08.613 --> 23:10.280
"No."

23:10.282 --> 23:12.048
What do you mean, "No"?

23:12.050 --> 23:13.216
What-what no?

23:13.218 --> 23:15.051
He doesn't want to talk.

23:15.053 --> 23:17.053
What do you mean?
He's talking to you.

23:17.055 --> 23:18.855
He doesn't
want to talk

23:18.857 --> 23:21.291
to me.

23:21.293 --> 23:23.226
He's been here
all along.

23:23.228 --> 23:26.229
And he's choosing not to talk
to me... (sniffles)

23:26.231 --> 23:27.997
'cause he blames me.

23:27.999 --> 23:30.166
I'm the cause of his death.

23:30.168 --> 23:32.235
My love for him killed him.

23:32.237 --> 23:34.070
Love doesn't kill.

23:37.976 --> 23:40.710
I've been around a lot longer,
and let me tell you something.

23:40.712 --> 23:43.713
Believe me, love kills
a lot more than hate.

23:46.818 --> 23:48.885
Thank you for coming anyway.

23:51.923 --> 23:53.757
Be strong.

23:53.759 --> 23:56.893
I know you know how.

23:56.895 --> 23:59.562
(whispers):
Yep.

23:59.564 --> 24:01.898
No. This isn't right.

24:01.900 --> 24:04.868
No, wait.
(sighs)

24:04.870 --> 24:07.937
Maybe it wasn't Tristan
you were talking to.

24:09.841 --> 24:13.176
He remembers the pancakes.

24:16.114 --> 24:18.348
You made them for him
every Saturday

24:18.350 --> 24:20.250
and let him watch cartoons
all morning.

24:20.252 --> 24:21.885
Who's Donovan?

24:21.887 --> 24:23.953
What?

24:25.924 --> 24:27.690
Donovan isn't here.

24:27.692 --> 24:29.359
No, no, no.

24:29.361 --> 24:31.194
Donovan is someplace else.

24:31.196 --> 24:34.397
Someplace very beautiful.

24:34.399 --> 24:37.634
He says it smells like pancakes.

24:39.571 --> 24:41.571
<i> Your</i> pancakes.

24:41.573 --> 24:45.375
He says it's always
Saturday morning where he is.

24:46.778 --> 24:48.845
He says...

24:50.248 --> 24:53.249
"I love you, Mom."

24:53.251 --> 24:57.220
LIZ:<i> Even in my grief,</i>
<i> I was happy for my friend.</i>

24:57.222 --> 25:00.824
<i> As for me, I felt</i>
<i> any chance at love was over.</i>

25:00.826 --> 25:03.226
<i> But life can surprise you.</i>

25:03.228 --> 25:05.995
<i> Especially new life.</i>

25:05.997 --> 25:08.898
(screaming)

25:08.900 --> 25:10.467
<i> And love?</i>

25:10.469 --> 25:12.735
<i>Well, that can take many forms.</i>

25:12.737 --> 25:15.438
<i> After I made peace</i>
<i> with my son Douglas,</i>

25:15.440 --> 25:17.607
<i> I never really expected</i>
<i> to see him again.</i>

25:17.609 --> 25:20.643
<i> So I was delighted when</i>
<i> he brought Janice to meet me.</i>

25:20.645 --> 25:23.246
<i> Janice was the daughter</i>
<i> I always wanted.</i>

25:23.248 --> 25:25.582
<i> And I was the mother-in-law</i>
<i> she'd always hoped for.</i>

25:25.584 --> 25:26.816
(baby crying)

25:26.818 --> 25:29.786
<i> In Isabelle's face,</i>
<i> I saw the future.</i>

25:29.788 --> 25:33.456
<i>She was being born into a world</i>
<i> just a little more accepting</i>

25:33.458 --> 25:35.458
<i> than the one</i>
<i> I had been born into.</i>

25:35.460 --> 25:37.627
<i> And maybe, just maybe,</i>

25:37.629 --> 25:40.597
<i> I had a little something</i>
<i> to do with that.</i>

25:40.599 --> 25:43.433
<i> A little kindness, acceptance.</i>

25:43.435 --> 25:47.937
<i> That transformed me in ways</i>
<i> nothing else ever could.</i>

25:47.939 --> 25:50.540
<i> I never thought life</i>
<i> could be this good.</i>

25:52.477 --> 25:55.845
<i> Or that it might end.</i>

25:55.847 --> 25:57.881
Well, shit!

25:57.883 --> 25:59.382
Are you sure?

25:59.384 --> 26:00.517
I'm sure.

26:00.519 --> 26:01.851
Well...

26:01.853 --> 26:03.786
the doctor is sure.

26:03.788 --> 26:06.155
And there ain't nothing
they can do about it?

26:06.157 --> 26:09.993
It's... past the point
of treatment.

26:09.995 --> 26:13.029
Which is probably for the best.

26:13.031 --> 26:16.032
'Cause...

26:16.034 --> 26:18.301
I would hate
to lose my hair.

26:21.039 --> 26:23.039
Baby girl,

26:23.041 --> 26:25.909
there just might be something
that I can do for you.

26:25.911 --> 26:27.544
(scoffs)
Huh?

26:27.546 --> 26:28.878
What, turn me?

26:28.880 --> 26:30.980
Hell, I don't even
like my steak bloody.

26:30.982 --> 26:32.549
But that's never been
an option for me.

26:32.551 --> 26:33.750
You know that.

26:33.752 --> 26:36.819
And at this point
in my life,

26:36.821 --> 26:40.657
I can't imagine killing
in order to live.

26:40.659 --> 26:42.559
So have you told
your kids yet?

26:43.695 --> 26:46.496
With any luck,
I won't need to.

26:46.498 --> 26:48.831
They can just keep
visiting me here.

26:52.070 --> 26:54.003
(camera clicking)

26:54.005 --> 26:55.471
(chuckles)

27:01.413 --> 27:03.413
(chuckles)

27:03.415 --> 27:06.215
I'm gonna cut to the chase.

27:06.217 --> 27:09.852
I am the first woman in the
world to have prostate cancer.

27:09.854 --> 27:14.023
Uh, the doctor told me
it's spread to the spine

27:14.025 --> 27:16.693
and there's nothing to do.

27:22.601 --> 27:23.933
We'll spend whatever we have to.

27:23.935 --> 27:26.603
One call and I can get you
to the best doctor in the world.

27:26.605 --> 27:27.804
Oh, it's too late.

27:27.806 --> 27:30.406
And I don't want to spend

27:30.408 --> 27:32.408
my last days wasting away
in a hospital

27:32.410 --> 27:34.711
with a catheter up my dick
and poison in my body,

27:34.713 --> 27:36.713
so...

27:36.715 --> 27:38.915
But who will take care
of us?

27:38.917 --> 27:41.050
You can't leave us alone.
I won't.

27:41.052 --> 27:43.219
That's why I called you all
here today.

27:43.221 --> 27:47.991
Now, I have provided you
with various weapons.

27:47.993 --> 27:50.593
Take two. They're small.
(chuckles)

27:50.595 --> 27:52.829
Uh...

27:52.831 --> 27:54.797
hack me.

27:54.799 --> 27:56.833
Strangle me.

27:56.835 --> 27:58.935
Bludgeon me.

27:58.937 --> 28:01.938
Surprise me.

28:01.940 --> 28:04.841
MS. EVERS:
I think I can speak for
everyone here when I say

28:04.843 --> 28:07.276
that we've all grown
rather fond of you.

28:07.278 --> 28:09.245
We can't possibly
murder you.

28:09.247 --> 28:10.780
SALLY:
It's not murder.

28:10.782 --> 28:13.583
She wants to be reborn.

28:13.585 --> 28:15.885
("The Ballad of Lucy Jordan"
by Marianne Faithfull playing)

28:20.458 --> 28:22.525
You're my family.

28:24.763 --> 28:27.497
I want to be with you forever.

28:28.466 --> 28:30.600
¶ The morning sun ¶

28:30.602 --> 28:35.938
¶ Touched lightly on
the eyes of Lucy Jordan ¶

28:35.940 --> 28:39.842
¶ In a white suburban bedroom ¶

28:39.844 --> 28:43.713
¶ In a white suburban town ¶

28:43.715 --> 28:47.717
¶ And she lay there
neath the covers ¶

28:47.719 --> 28:51.454
¶ Dreaming of
a thousand lovers ¶

28:51.456 --> 28:55.625
¶ Till the world
turned to orange ¶

28:55.627 --> 29:01.631
¶ And the room went
spinning round ¶

29:01.633 --> 29:06.469
¶ At the age of 37 ¶

29:06.471 --> 29:09.706
¶ She realized
she'd never ride ¶

29:09.708 --> 29:13.743
¶ Through Paris
in a sports car ¶

29:13.745 --> 29:15.378
(door whooshes open)

29:15.380 --> 29:19.882
¶ With the warm wind
in her hair ¶

29:19.884 --> 29:22.552
¶ So she let the phone
keep ringing... ¶

29:22.554 --> 29:26.489
LIZ:<i> It was the first time</i>
<i> I'd seen her since she died.</i>

29:26.491 --> 29:29.225
<i> Only in that moment</i>
<i> did I realize</i>

29:29.227 --> 29:32.328
<i> just how much I'd missed her.</i>

29:32.330 --> 29:34.897
How did you know to come?

29:34.899 --> 29:39.102
You were always
my fondest creation.

29:39.104 --> 29:40.837
¶ He's off to work ¶

29:40.839 --> 29:45.708
¶ And the kids
are off to school ¶

29:45.710 --> 29:49.011
¶ And there were
oh so many ways... ¶

29:49.013 --> 29:51.748
I wanted to be here
to help you transition.

29:51.750 --> 29:53.549
¶ For her to spend her day ¶

29:53.551 --> 29:58.020
¶ She could clean the house
for hours ¶

29:58.022 --> 30:01.190
¶ Or rearrange the flowers ¶

30:01.192 --> 30:05.695
¶ Or run naked
through the shady street... ¶

30:05.697 --> 30:09.365
One last time.

30:09.367 --> 30:10.867
(exhales)

30:10.869 --> 30:13.302
¶ At the age of 37 ¶

30:13.304 --> 30:16.706
¶ She realized
she'd never ride ¶

30:16.708 --> 30:19.609
¶ Through Paris ¶

30:19.611 --> 30:21.444
¶ In a sports car... ¶

30:24.716 --> 30:26.783
¶ ¶

30:54.012 --> 30:56.078
TRISTAN:
Those things'll kill you.

31:05.857 --> 31:08.024
I don't understand.

31:08.026 --> 31:10.092
You wouldn't talk to me.

31:12.430 --> 31:14.297
I thought you hated me.

31:14.299 --> 31:16.365
I love you.

31:20.371 --> 31:22.638
And, darlin',

31:22.640 --> 31:24.974
you had more living to do.

31:24.976 --> 31:27.043
I couldn't get
in the way of that.

31:29.647 --> 31:31.280
(laughs)

31:33.151 --> 31:35.551
Oh, baby...

31:35.553 --> 31:37.920
you are to die for.

31:51.569 --> 31:53.302
May I help you?
I have a reservation.

31:53.304 --> 31:54.537
Room 44.

31:54.539 --> 31:56.138
The Woo room.

31:56.140 --> 31:57.707
That's where Billie Dean
says he died.

31:57.709 --> 31:59.909
Oh, that room is booked.

31:59.911 --> 32:01.544
Booked by me, three weeks ago.

32:01.546 --> 32:03.379
Under Rhodes, Ashley.

32:03.381 --> 32:05.748
My Amex app
says the charge has cleared.

32:05.750 --> 32:08.584
You have my money.
I want my room.

32:08.586 --> 32:11.420
Fine.

32:15.860 --> 32:17.760
It's all my fault.

32:17.762 --> 32:19.896
I thought that Billie'd be
free advertising.

32:19.898 --> 32:22.064
You know, people love
a good ghost story.

32:22.066 --> 32:24.767
Well, you were
right about that.

32:24.769 --> 32:27.436
Yeah, but this is getting
way out of hand.

32:27.438 --> 32:30.206
She's had
three prime-time specials.

32:30.208 --> 32:32.508
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

32:32.510 --> 32:34.610
Wait, he's trying
to tell me something.

32:38.549 --> 32:40.049
Mr. Woo doesn't pay for what?

32:40.051 --> 32:41.751
IRIS:
<i> I mean, don't get me wrong.</i>

32:41.753 --> 32:44.420
I don't mind having this place
alive with guests.

32:44.422 --> 32:46.722
It's just
those freaks and weirdos

32:46.724 --> 32:48.624
who want to be
plowed by a ghost.

32:48.626 --> 32:51.294
The people Billie attracts,
they're just...

32:51.296 --> 32:53.729
It's bad for our brand.

32:53.731 --> 32:56.232
Why don't we just
shut the place down?

32:56.234 --> 32:58.467
Will Drake doesn't need
the money anymore.

32:58.469 --> 33:00.770
'Cause this place needs life.

33:00.772 --> 33:03.139
It's a hotel, not a cemetery.

33:03.141 --> 33:05.241
The living give the spirits
trapped in this place

33:05.243 --> 33:07.143
a connection
to the outside world.

33:07.145 --> 33:08.711
IRIS:
John.

33:08.713 --> 33:11.414
I was wondering when
you were gonna arrive.

33:11.416 --> 33:12.982
We've missed you.

33:12.984 --> 33:15.885
It's good to be back.
And you're right.

33:15.887 --> 33:17.920
I don't like her
coming around.

33:17.922 --> 33:19.889
Pestering,
asking questions.

33:19.891 --> 33:21.657
She still trying
to contact me?

33:21.659 --> 33:24.060
Every year on this date.

33:25.897 --> 33:28.597
John Lowe.

33:28.599 --> 33:30.333
The Ten Commandments Killer.

33:30.335 --> 33:33.402
Show yourself and bear witness
to your crimes.

33:41.512 --> 33:43.512
Shit.

33:43.514 --> 33:44.981
Call her.

33:44.983 --> 33:46.482
Check her into my room.

33:46.484 --> 33:47.950
But get her here quickly.

33:47.952 --> 33:49.885
It's only three hours
until sundown.

33:57.261 --> 34:02.098
We are standing in room 64
of the Hotel Cortez,

34:02.100 --> 34:04.834
where the notorious
Ten Commandments Killer lived

34:04.836 --> 34:07.436
when he terrorized Los Angeles
many years ago.

34:07.438 --> 34:11.374
John Lowe may be the most evil
and dangerous spirit

34:11.376 --> 34:14.477
with whom I have ever attempted
to make contact.

34:14.479 --> 34:18.881
I will need all of my skills
and powers of concentration

34:18.883 --> 34:22.551
to achieve
this unprecedented interview.

34:26.124 --> 34:27.923
(sighs softly)

34:31.362 --> 34:34.463
(static hums softly)

34:34.465 --> 34:37.133
You wanted to talk?

34:40.238 --> 34:42.705
I want you to talk.

34:42.707 --> 34:45.975
My name is
Billie Dean Howard.

34:45.977 --> 34:50.513
All we know about John Lowe
is what the police have said.

34:50.515 --> 34:54.383
I'm giving you a chance now
to set the record straight.

34:56.988 --> 34:59.055
(chuckles softly)

35:02.393 --> 35:04.460
(mouthing)

35:11.669 --> 35:14.403
What do you
want to know?

35:15.740 --> 35:19.208
Why don't we start
with your family.

35:19.210 --> 35:20.776
Did they know

35:20.778 --> 35:22.912
you were a
serial killer?

35:22.914 --> 35:25.014
What'd you get Holden
for dinner?
It's dog again.

35:25.016 --> 35:26.782
JOHN:
<i> They came to understand</i>

35:26.784 --> 35:28.784
that I was
cleaning up the world,

35:28.786 --> 35:31.387
in my own way.
ALEX:<i> Goddamn it, John.</i>

35:31.389 --> 35:33.255
We talked about this;
I was not gonna target people

35:33.257 --> 35:34.723
who do not deserve to die.

35:34.725 --> 35:36.525
Now, once you went on the lam,

35:36.527 --> 35:39.562
your wife and two children
were never seen again.

35:39.564 --> 35:40.463
ALEX:
Come on.

35:40.465 --> 35:41.964
Where are you going?
He's hungry.

35:41.966 --> 35:43.132
I know how to walk into
a hospital

35:43.134 --> 35:44.133
and not get noticed.

35:44.135 --> 35:46.035
Did you kill them?

35:46.037 --> 35:49.672
I will admit,
I failed them.

36:00.218 --> 36:02.618
Daddy?

36:02.620 --> 36:06.555
There's only one
thing left to do.

36:06.557 --> 36:09.058
Turn myself in?

36:09.060 --> 36:11.127
We have to go home.

36:17.001 --> 36:18.400
JOHN:
<i> Scarlett was right.</i>

36:18.402 --> 36:20.236
<i> The Cortez was home.</i>

36:20.238 --> 36:23.606
<i> We'd all been reborn there,</i>
<i> in one form or another.</i>

36:23.608 --> 36:25.808
<i> Well, except for her.</i>

36:25.810 --> 36:27.810
<i> There was a still a chance</i>
<i> for our daughter</i>

36:27.812 --> 36:29.745
<i> to grow up somewhere else,</i>

36:29.747 --> 36:32.781
<i> to have some shot</i>
<i> at a normal life.</i>

36:32.783 --> 36:35.851
<i> But it needed to be</i>
<i> away from us.</i>

36:35.853 --> 36:37.820
<i> Liz knew just the place.</i>

36:37.822 --> 36:39.688
<i> The Thatcher School</i>
<i> would be host</i>

36:39.690 --> 36:43.659
<i> to more than one young refugee</i>
<i> from the Hotel Cortez.</i>

36:43.661 --> 36:46.795
BILLIE:
<i>So you sent your daughter away,</i>

36:46.797 --> 36:49.999
<i> but lived with your son</i>
<i> and wife in the Cortez,</i>

36:50.001 --> 36:53.969
<i> back in L.A., where you were</i>
<i> still being hunted.</i>

36:53.971 --> 36:57.373
It's hard to provide for your
family when you're on the run.

36:57.375 --> 37:01.544
There were more opportunities
in Los Angeles.

37:10.655 --> 37:12.354
(grunts)

37:18.062 --> 37:20.129
¶ ¶

37:37.481 --> 37:40.516
(tires screeching,
sirens wailing)

37:40.518 --> 37:44.153
OFFICER: Stop! John Lowe,
you're under arrest!

37:44.155 --> 37:46.088
I have to make it back
to the hotel.

37:46.090 --> 37:47.957
(gunfire)

38:08.179 --> 38:10.446
(wheezing)

38:10.448 --> 38:11.847
Let me...

38:11.849 --> 38:13.983
I want to die inside.

38:17.288 --> 38:22.191
I'm sensing something
about your wife and son.

38:24.128 --> 38:26.762
I can hear the undercurrents
from the spirits,

38:26.764 --> 38:29.064
but they are too afraid
to speak clearly.

38:29.066 --> 38:30.933
Why is that?

38:30.935 --> 38:33.636
I don't want to talk
about my family.

38:33.638 --> 38:35.537
Well, if you don't want
to talk about your family,

38:35.539 --> 38:36.939
then give me something else.

38:36.941 --> 38:41.877
What is the significance
of October 30?

38:41.879 --> 38:45.681
Why is it the only day
I feel your presence here?

38:48.119 --> 38:50.052
Well, it's Devil's Night.

38:50.054 --> 38:53.555
And if you leave your
camera crew behind,

38:53.557 --> 38:55.624
that I can show you.

38:59.397 --> 39:01.463
¶ ¶

39:20.518 --> 39:21.784
BILLIE:
<i> The walls. They're screaming.</i>

39:21.786 --> 39:26.288
I was in a house once
just west of here.

39:26.290 --> 39:31.293
And I could hear the spirits
in the walls like termites...

39:31.295 --> 39:34.330
or bats in the attic.

39:34.332 --> 39:37.433
But it was nothing like this.

39:37.435 --> 39:41.870
This is like being
in a rock concert of the dead.

39:43.507 --> 39:45.841
Well, come on.

39:45.843 --> 39:48.777
Let me introduce you to some
rock stars of the dead.

39:48.779 --> 39:50.379
(jazz music playing)

39:50.381 --> 39:52.381
Oh, Jeffrey,
you and your damn straws.

39:52.383 --> 39:56.819
Come on. Put your drink down
and come and dance with me.

39:56.821 --> 39:58.887
I don't dance.

39:58.889 --> 40:00.723
Look at me.

40:00.725 --> 40:03.726
Neither do I.
(laughs)

40:03.728 --> 40:06.562
John! Oh!

40:06.564 --> 40:09.565
Jeffrey, look who's here.

40:09.567 --> 40:11.166
John is here.

40:11.168 --> 40:13.569
He's the greatest
of them all.

40:13.571 --> 40:15.571
Are you blushing?

40:15.573 --> 40:19.174
I told you, if you like a guy,
you have to talk to him.

40:19.176 --> 40:21.176
You think any of
those young men

40:21.178 --> 40:23.579
would have come over to work
at my house if I didn't have

40:23.581 --> 40:26.548
the guts to approach
them in the world?

40:26.550 --> 40:28.250
(scoffs)

40:28.252 --> 40:30.853
Well, those guys in Milwaukee
must have been pretty desperate

40:30.855 --> 40:32.521
to go home with Jeffrey.

40:32.523 --> 40:35.190
The guy can't get two words
out without going flush.

40:35.192 --> 40:36.492
(laughs)

40:36.494 --> 40:39.661
Oh, my God.

40:39.663 --> 40:41.730
You're John Wayne Gacy.

40:44.168 --> 40:47.002
And that's Jeffrey Dahmer.

40:49.373 --> 40:52.007
Are you frightened?

40:52.009 --> 40:54.676
Oh, no.

40:54.678 --> 41:00.015
No, I just surround myself with
the white light of spirit and...

41:00.017 --> 41:03.051
to keep myself protected.

41:03.053 --> 41:05.587
Sure thing, sweetheart.

41:05.589 --> 41:08.357
Yeah! Let's get
this party started!

41:08.359 --> 41:10.592
I need a beer.
I'll drink whatever's cold.

41:10.594 --> 41:14.229
Jesus H. Christ on a horse, what
the hell is this shit music?

41:14.231 --> 41:15.764
Aileen Wuornos.
(record scratches)

41:15.766 --> 41:17.466
("Fade Into You"
by Mazzy Star playing)

41:17.468 --> 41:19.368
Richard Ramirez.

41:19.370 --> 41:22.004
I'm married, but
we live apart.

41:27.578 --> 41:29.778
And that's the Zodiac.

41:29.780 --> 41:32.114
I'll get you a drink.

41:36.053 --> 41:40.289
¶ I want to hold the hand
inside you... ¶

41:40.291 --> 41:43.292
Uh, hey.

41:43.294 --> 41:44.793
I'm Aileen.

41:44.795 --> 41:47.563
¶ I want to take a breath... ¶

41:47.565 --> 41:50.799
You have
the prettiest hair.

41:50.801 --> 41:54.303
Man, what I wouldn't do for
a head of hair like that.

41:54.305 --> 41:56.805
It's like... it's
like Farrah Fawcett.

41:56.807 --> 41:59.675
Reminds me of my-my
ex-girlfriend.

41:59.677 --> 42:02.678
(laughs)
Oh, I feel ill.

42:02.680 --> 42:04.646
All these dark spirits.

42:04.648 --> 42:07.649
It's... (chuckles)
it's a little overwhelming.

42:07.651 --> 42:10.652
Just drink that.
It'll relax you.

42:10.654 --> 42:13.021
MARCH:
Absinthe!

42:13.023 --> 42:15.891
Our customary libation.

42:20.764 --> 42:24.466
James Patrick March.

42:24.468 --> 42:26.935
Oh.

42:26.937 --> 42:29.404
Oh, I feel the violence in you.

42:31.642 --> 42:35.344
So many spirits
who you snuffed out.

42:37.781 --> 42:41.717
I can see all the moments
when they crossed over.

42:41.719 --> 42:44.186
Tell me,

42:44.188 --> 42:45.988
what is that like?

42:45.990 --> 42:48.991
Is it a moving picture, like
so many cells on a film reel?

42:48.993 --> 42:51.727
Or more like a kaleidoscope
of human suffering?

42:51.729 --> 42:54.296
It's not a picture.

42:54.298 --> 42:57.499
It's a feeling.

42:57.501 --> 43:00.969
Like a mist on your face
on a cold morning.

43:03.140 --> 43:06.708
You can't see it in the air,
but you can feel...

43:06.710 --> 43:08.510
the wetness.

43:08.512 --> 43:10.512
Yeah. I can feel
the wetness

43:10.514 --> 43:12.748
with you so close to me
right now, Johnny boy.

43:12.750 --> 43:15.217
(both laughing)

43:22.993 --> 43:26.228
I got a seat
right next to me.

43:26.230 --> 43:28.063
(panting)

43:28.065 --> 43:29.965
(chuckles)

43:33.170 --> 43:34.736
(laughs)

43:38.275 --> 43:40.108
So this is Devil's Night.

43:40.110 --> 43:42.177
My Murderers' Row!

43:42.179 --> 43:45.180
How odd it must be
to see all of us then

43:45.182 --> 43:47.349
in what appears
to be the flesh.

43:47.351 --> 43:49.885
Flesh enough to eat,

43:49.887 --> 43:51.753
drink,

43:51.755 --> 43:54.523
feel our grip on your arm,

43:54.525 --> 43:56.625
our breath on your skin.

43:56.627 --> 43:59.227
(shouts)
No!

43:59.229 --> 44:02.731
(laughter)

44:02.733 --> 44:05.133
How's that white light
holding up, Billie Dean?

44:05.135 --> 44:07.369
BILLIE:
I don't want to be here anymore.

44:07.371 --> 44:09.771
When does
the party favor arrive?

44:09.773 --> 44:11.807
MARCH:
John's taken care of that.

44:11.809 --> 44:13.241
Grab your weapons,

44:13.243 --> 44:14.776
ladies and gents.

44:16.280 --> 44:17.079
No.

44:17.081 --> 44:17.846
(chuckles)

44:19.383 --> 44:21.550
No. (screams)

44:21.552 --> 44:23.986
Can't throw a killer party
without a little killing, right?

44:23.988 --> 44:25.120
(panting)

44:25.122 --> 44:26.822
JOHN:
Don't worry, Billie.

44:26.824 --> 44:29.157
I think you're gonna like
living here.

44:29.159 --> 44:30.993
Here's the deal.

44:30.995 --> 44:33.495
No more specials or interviews

44:33.497 --> 44:36.298
or books or tweets
or casual conversations

44:36.300 --> 44:38.000
at cocktail parties
with Shirley MacLaine

44:38.002 --> 44:39.501
about this hotel.

44:39.503 --> 44:41.503
This place is dead to you.

44:41.505 --> 44:43.005
We will become a myth,

44:43.007 --> 44:45.807
which is what we should've been
left to do anyway.

44:45.809 --> 44:47.242
What if I don't?

44:47.244 --> 44:48.977
AILEEN: One sure-as-shit thing
I can tell you

44:48.979 --> 44:52.247
about being murdered: it hurts.

44:52.249 --> 44:55.617
And we like to make it last...

44:55.619 --> 44:57.586
(drill whirs)

44:57.588 --> 45:01.523
None of you can
leave the hotel, so...

45:01.525 --> 45:05.494
you can't hold me
to my word, huh?

45:05.496 --> 45:07.562
RAMONA:
But I can.

45:10.501 --> 45:12.534
BILLIE:
What the hell are you?

45:12.536 --> 45:15.370
You're not dead.

45:15.372 --> 45:16.872
I'm a creature

45:16.874 --> 45:19.508
who kills to live

45:19.510 --> 45:22.144
and who drinks a body's worth
of blood a day

45:22.146 --> 45:23.612
and doesn't think twice about

45:23.614 --> 45:26.448
who I'm sucking
it from.

45:26.450 --> 45:29.151
So, if you even let out
a whisper of a word

45:29.153 --> 45:30.886
that sounds
like "Cortez,"

45:30.888 --> 45:34.890
I'll find you
and drain every drop of life

45:34.892 --> 45:37.559
from your skinny ass.

45:37.561 --> 45:39.394
RAMIREZ:
I can't be the only one here

45:39.396 --> 45:41.029
hoping you say no.

45:41.031 --> 45:42.631
(drill whirs, laughter)
No!

45:45.002 --> 45:47.069
No! No!

46:05.856 --> 46:07.923
¶ ¶

46:21.605 --> 46:24.506
Did you take care of
what you had to take care of?

46:24.508 --> 46:25.574
Yeah.

46:25.576 --> 46:28.009
Look at you, Scarlett.

46:28.011 --> 46:29.745
Where'd my
little girl go?

46:29.747 --> 46:31.246
You're just saying that 'cause

46:31.248 --> 46:33.448
I'm the only member
of the family that ages.

46:33.450 --> 46:35.050
(chuckles)

46:35.052 --> 46:37.452
Thanks for coming.

46:37.454 --> 46:39.855
Tonight means a lot to me.

46:39.857 --> 46:41.289
For us

46:41.291 --> 46:43.058
all to be together.

46:43.060 --> 46:45.026
Even just for a few hours.

46:45.028 --> 46:46.895
Of course, Dad.

46:46.897 --> 46:49.297
Means a lot to me, too.

46:49.299 --> 46:51.867
Go on.

46:51.869 --> 46:54.870
Get into bed with them.

46:54.872 --> 46:56.705
Not you?

46:56.707 --> 46:57.939
I'm getting
a little big

46:57.941 --> 46:59.741
for the family bed.

46:59.743 --> 47:01.810
I'll take the chair.

47:12.289 --> 47:14.422
I'm afraid to
fall asleep.

47:14.424 --> 47:17.793
As soon as I close my eyes,

47:17.795 --> 47:20.829
it'll all be gone
for another year.

47:20.831 --> 47:23.331
It's okay, Daddy.

47:25.002 --> 47:27.035
Rest.

47:33.310 --> 47:35.377

¶ ¶

48:42.012 --> 48:45.213
What brings you
to the Cortez?

48:45.215 --> 48:47.215
Tomorrow's Halloween.

48:47.217 --> 48:49.985
This place is supposed
to be haunted, right?

48:49.987 --> 48:52.888
I'm meeting
some friends here.

48:52.890 --> 48:54.656
No, you're not.

48:55.692 --> 48:57.192
I'm not?

48:57.194 --> 48:59.261
No.

49:02.766 --> 49:05.600
You have a jawline for days.
