BUT IF HE KEEPS
SAYING HELLO

13:59.547 --> 14:01.003
THEN OBVIOUSLY
HE CAN'T HEAR

14:01.090 --> 14:02.922
BECAUSE OF
A BAD CONNECTION!

14:03.009 --> 14:04.340
HE CAN HEAR ME.

14:04.385 --> 14:05.716
I KNOW HE CAN HEAR ME!

14:05.803 --> 14:07.589
THEN WHY DON'T
YOU HANG UP?

14:07.680 --> 14:09.466
