WEBVTT

00:00.250 --> 00:03.416
I gotta get goin'

00:03.416 --> 00:06.291
a friend of mine

00:08.000 --> 00:11.458
he's just Pooh Bear

00:14.000 --> 00:17.583
chasin' some honeybees

00:17.583 --> 00:21.000
I know he's out there

00:24.583 --> 00:28.000
we're so adventurous

00:28.000 --> 00:31.250
and again

00:31.250 --> 00:34.500
and there's nobody home

00:34.500 --> 00:38.000
to count on a friend

00:38.000 --> 00:41.833
Winnie the Pooh Bear

00:43.875 --> 00:45.583
take me, please?

00:45.583 --> 00:49.000
I got to be there

00:50.833 --> 00:56.000
Winnie the Pooh

01:15.291 --> 01:16.708
Dagnabbit!

01:16.708 --> 01:19.875
Uhh, shouldn't be
hitting bedrock yet.

01:19.875 --> 01:22.000
Hold everything!

01:23.125 --> 01:25.958
Hmm. Nah. Nah. Uh-huh.

01:25.958 --> 01:29.375
That's it.
I missed my turnoff.

01:29.375 --> 01:32.291
Eh, no time to lollygag.

01:32.291 --> 01:36.208
Got places to be
and tunnels to dig.

01:36.208 --> 01:38.083
Hmm. Hmph.

01:38.083 --> 01:40.583
I knew I should have
brought along the big pick.

01:54.291 --> 01:55.708
There.

01:55.708 --> 01:57.250
This should keep everyone

01:57.250 --> 01:59.833
from trampling
my garden every day.

01:59.833 --> 02:02.000
If it isn't one thing,
it's another.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.125
- Hmm.
- Rabbit, I came

02:04.125 --> 02:07.125
to return the honey jars
I borrowed for breakfast.

02:07.125 --> 02:08.416
How could you?

02:08.416 --> 02:10.750
You're in my garden.

02:10.750 --> 02:12.625
We are?

02:12.625 --> 02:17.083
The signs say keep out,
among other things.

02:17.083 --> 02:18.583
Can't you read them?

02:18.583 --> 02:20.291
Oh, I can read them,
Rabbit.

02:20.291 --> 02:23.125
I just can't see them.

02:23.125 --> 02:24.750
Whoa!

02:26.000 --> 02:28.750
Piglet!
Look what you've done.

02:32.625 --> 02:38.500
A young, vibrant carrot
mooshed before its prime,

02:38.500 --> 02:42.958
and all because you and Pooh
have no regard for my garden.

02:42.958 --> 02:44.208
Oomph!

02:44.208 --> 02:47.083
Tigger! No, no, no!

02:50.375 --> 02:52.291
My garden's ruined!

02:52.291 --> 02:56.333
Nah. I just gave it
that bounced-in look.

02:56.333 --> 02:57.750
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!

03:03.000 --> 03:04.833
Oh! What now?

03:04.833 --> 03:08.375
I'll teach you
to dig up my vegetables.

03:10.750 --> 03:13.375
Oh, my. Who turned out
the lights?

03:13.375 --> 03:14.833
Where's my garden?

03:14.833 --> 03:16.500
Hmm. Ah.

03:16.500 --> 03:20.208
So that's why there's
all those roots in my way.

03:21.333 --> 03:23.583
Well, it's gonna have to go.

03:23.583 --> 03:26.708
You don't mind if I clear
away some of the deadwood,

03:26.708 --> 03:28.250
uh, do you, Rabbit?

03:28.250 --> 03:29.458
Do what you want, Gopher.

03:29.458 --> 03:30.875
Just stay out of my garden!

03:30.875 --> 03:32.333
Coming through.

03:32.333 --> 03:35.333
Everybody
stand clear.

03:35.333 --> 03:37.500
Uh, stand clear
of what, Gopher?

03:37.500 --> 03:40.166
The big kerpowee,
that's what?

03:40.166 --> 03:41.875
Kerpowee?

03:41.875 --> 03:45.000
Oh, my. I don't like
the sound of that.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.583
Maybe you'd better
hold your ears, Piglet,

03:47.583 --> 03:48.875
like this.

03:48.875 --> 03:51.833
Here we go. Just press
this doohickey down,

03:51.833 --> 03:54.083
- and, uh--
- Uh-oh.

03:59.250 --> 04:01.375
Did somebody say something?

04:02.416 --> 04:04.208
"Keep out."

04:04.208 --> 04:05.875
Well, heh heh heh heh,

04:05.875 --> 04:07.750
that takes care of that.

04:07.750 --> 04:09.083
Back to my digging.

04:09.083 --> 04:12.000
My garden! It's gone! Gone!

04:12.000 --> 04:15.250
Oh, ha ha ha ha!
Cheer up, floppy ears.

04:15.250 --> 04:16.458
It's not gone.

04:16.458 --> 04:19.416
It's just been,
uh, uh, tossed.

04:19.416 --> 04:21.583
Uh, got any
Tarzan Island dressing?

04:21.583 --> 04:24.875
This is your fault!
All of yours!

04:24.875 --> 04:28.708
First Pooh and Piglet,
then Tigger. Now this.

04:28.708 --> 04:32.500
Why do you always
ruin my garden?

04:32.500 --> 04:34.500
It never did anything
to any of you.

04:34.500 --> 04:38.125
From now on,
I'm a rabbit unto myself.

04:38.125 --> 04:39.125
Hmph!

04:39.125 --> 04:41.458
Hmm. Is it just me,

04:41.458 --> 04:44.708
or does something seem to be
bothering friend Rabbit?

04:44.708 --> 04:49.625
You know, I haven't
given fuzz bottom
a good bouncing in days.

04:49.625 --> 04:52.333
I feel an empty spot
in my life.

04:52.333 --> 04:54.458
I know what you mean, Tigger.

04:54.458 --> 04:57.416
I usually feel
that same empty spot

04:57.416 --> 04:59.416
just before dinner.

05:01.125 --> 05:05.166
I can't quite
put my finger on it,

05:05.166 --> 05:07.125
but I believe
Rabbit's garden

05:07.125 --> 05:09.291
is somehow...different?

05:09.291 --> 05:13.625
Hmm. This calls for some
serious investergating.

05:13.625 --> 05:15.583
Uh, perhaps we should
come back later

05:15.583 --> 05:18.250
when the garden's--
-- friendlier?

05:18.250 --> 05:20.458
Naw. Just follow me.

05:20.458 --> 05:22.583
I'll lead you around
them booby traps.

05:22.583 --> 05:25.583
Tiggers are experts
on trapping boobies,
you know.

05:25.583 --> 05:29.583
Oh, don't worry. You can
ride on my shoulders, Piglet.

05:29.583 --> 05:31.208
You'll be safe up here.

05:31.208 --> 05:33.708
Hmm. I better get this
out of the way

05:33.708 --> 05:35.875
before somebody trips over it.

05:37.125 --> 05:39.166
Uh, Tigger?

05:40.375 --> 05:43.166
- Piglet?

05:44.375 --> 05:46.875
Well, ha ha,
that takes care of that.

05:46.875 --> 05:49.583
- Excuse me, Tigger, but--
- Not now, Pooh Bear.

05:49.583 --> 05:52.000
We got traps to unboobify.

05:55.500 --> 05:57.166
Umph!

05:57.166 --> 05:59.708
I don't think you guys had
better step on this thing.

05:59.708 --> 06:01.875
It might be dangerous.

06:03.208 --> 06:04.333
Quiet, fellas.

06:04.333 --> 06:06.125
It's long ears.

06:06.125 --> 06:08.583
I'm coming for you,
buddy boy.

06:08.583 --> 06:10.583
Ooh! Wait a minute.

06:10.583 --> 06:11.708
This isn't Rabbit.

06:11.708 --> 06:13.875
I've been boobied.

06:13.875 --> 06:15.458
Hoo hoo hoo haah!

06:17.708 --> 06:20.083
Surprised you, didn't I?

06:20.083 --> 06:23.000
So how do you like it?
Hmm?

06:23.000 --> 06:25.166
How do I like it? Ha ha!

06:25.166 --> 06:28.000
Well, it's
the most wonderfulest
one I've ever seen.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.875
Heh heh.
Eh, what is it?

06:30.875 --> 06:32.416
It's, uh...

06:32.416 --> 06:34.000
It's certainly big.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.208
Rabbit: It's my fortress.

06:36.208 --> 06:40.083
From now on, no one will
be able to bother me

06:40.083 --> 06:42.000
or my garden again.

06:43.708 --> 06:47.958
The whole point of this
fortress is to keep you out.

06:47.958 --> 06:50.958
From now on, no matter
what you think,

06:50.958 --> 06:52.458
no matter what you hear,

06:52.458 --> 06:54.125
no matter what happens,

06:54.125 --> 06:58.166
you and you
and especially you

06:58.166 --> 07:00.833
are to stay away forever.

07:00.833 --> 07:03.375
But who will come
and borrow honey from you?

07:03.375 --> 07:04.875
No one!

07:04.875 --> 07:06.583
And that means you.

07:06.583 --> 07:10.708
Aw. My tummy will be
awfully sorry to hear that.

07:10.708 --> 07:12.416
Come on, guys.

07:12.416 --> 07:15.291
Something tells me
we're not wanted.

07:16.875 --> 07:19.250
Come along, Piglet.

07:22.125 --> 07:24.416
You took the words
right out of my mouth,

07:24.416 --> 07:26.416
Piglet old pal.

07:26.416 --> 07:29.583
Whew. Now for a little
peace and quiet

07:29.583 --> 07:31.083
and gardening.

07:31.083 --> 07:34.333
Hmm. Where did I
leave my shovel?

07:34.333 --> 07:37.500
Oh, yes. It's right
outside thedoor?

07:37.500 --> 07:39.500
Aah!

07:39.500 --> 07:42.250
The door! I forgot
to make a door!

07:42.250 --> 07:43.208
I can't get out!

07:43.208 --> 07:45.000
I'm trapped! Doomed!

07:45.000 --> 07:46.250
Do you hear?

07:46.250 --> 07:49.416
Wait! Pooh!

07:49.416 --> 07:50.708
Tigger!

07:50.708 --> 07:52.958
Please come back!

07:52.958 --> 07:54.458
Oh, no, you don't.

07:54.458 --> 07:56.125
You told us
not to come back.

07:56.125 --> 07:58.458
You can booby a tigger oncet,

07:58.458 --> 08:00.125
but you can't make him drink.

08:02.333 --> 08:04.416
Yeah. You tell him, kiddo.

08:04.416 --> 08:07.583
I think Rabbit is testing us

08:07.583 --> 08:10.125
to see how good
of friends we are.

08:10.125 --> 08:12.458
We should go before
we hurt his feelings.

08:12.458 --> 08:14.458
Oh, no. They're leaving.

08:16.458 --> 08:18.208
I'll starve.

08:18.208 --> 08:19.708
Starve?

08:19.708 --> 08:22.333
Oh, Pooh!

08:22.333 --> 08:26.291
How about a little
smackerel of honey?

08:26.291 --> 08:27.500
Honey.

08:27.500 --> 08:28.875
No, Pooh.

08:28.875 --> 08:30.458
He's just trying
to trick us.

08:30.458 --> 08:35.333
Rabbit: Mm. That honey
does taste tasty.

08:35.333 --> 08:37.333
Bunny boy's counting on us.

08:37.333 --> 08:40.208
We can't go back,
no matter what.

08:40.208 --> 08:41.958
Rabbit: Oh, my.

08:41.958 --> 08:46.166
Where's Tigger when you
need a good bounce?

08:46.166 --> 08:48.625
Uh, did he say bounce?

08:48.625 --> 08:50.291
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!

08:53.708 --> 08:57.250
No, no. Farther back.
A little farther.

08:57.250 --> 08:59.583
Uh, that should do it.

08:59.583 --> 09:01.083
Don't worry, bunny boy.

09:01.083 --> 09:02.291
We'll bust you out

09:02.291 --> 09:03.958
if it's the last thing you do.

09:06.333 --> 09:08.875
Oh, d-d-dear.

09:19.708 --> 09:22.833
Ohh, my!

09:22.833 --> 09:25.333
Hey. How come
we do all the work

09:25.333 --> 09:27.875
and bunny boy gets to do
all the bouncing?

09:27.875 --> 09:29.625
Rabbit: Go on. Pull.

09:29.625 --> 09:31.625
Pull! Pull!

09:31.625 --> 09:33.458
I'm afraid

09:33.458 --> 09:36.083
there may not be
any pull left in me.

09:36.083 --> 09:40.250
Maybe if we got
a better grip.

09:40.250 --> 09:43.250
Yipe!

09:43.250 --> 09:47.125
Sure hope he's got
a round trip ticket.

09:47.125 --> 09:50.375
Yaah!

09:53.000 --> 09:55.291
Tigger,
there's no possible way

09:55.291 --> 09:57.583
you can get me through
that little hole.

09:57.583 --> 09:59.125
I'm just too big.

09:59.125 --> 10:00.708
Oh, Rabbit,

10:00.708 --> 10:03.583
it's just a small matter
of tiggernometry.

10:03.583 --> 10:05.458
We'll have you
vacuum free

10:05.458 --> 10:08.125
before you can say
hoo hoo hoo hoo!

10:13.583 --> 10:15.958
Oh, dear.

10:16.958 --> 10:18.208
We did it!

10:18.208 --> 10:19.708
Sure was simple.

10:19.708 --> 10:21.708
I hope Rabbit's all right.

10:21.708 --> 10:24.750
Genius. Pure genius.

10:26.958 --> 10:29.458
Rabbit, what are you
doing in there

10:29.458 --> 10:31.250
when you should be in there?

10:31.250 --> 10:34.083
I told you I was too big
to hit through the hole.

10:34.083 --> 10:37.083
Yeah, maybe, but what
happened to your garden?

10:39.833 --> 10:41.125
Yaah!

10:47.000 --> 10:49.416
Ah, I might as well face it.

10:49.416 --> 10:52.625
I'll probably spend
the rest of my life in here.

10:52.625 --> 10:55.583
Yeah, but look at the
bright side, bunny boy.

10:55.583 --> 10:57.583
Maybe you won't
live that long.

10:57.583 --> 10:59.833
Is there anything
we can do, Rabbit?

10:59.833 --> 11:03.875
No, except maybe try
not to forget me.

11:03.875 --> 11:06.500
Of course not, uh...

11:07.583 --> 11:08.583
Rabbit.

11:08.583 --> 11:10.875
Well, that's that.

11:10.875 --> 11:13.458
Can't stand
around here forever.

11:13.458 --> 11:16.625
I've got tunnels
that need blasting.

11:18.458 --> 11:21.375
Mm. That's an idea.

11:21.375 --> 11:22.583
Blast him out.

11:22.583 --> 11:25.291
Hmm. That's an idear.

11:25.291 --> 11:26.833
Blast him out.

11:26.833 --> 11:28.958
Hmm. That's an idea.

11:28.958 --> 11:31.750
I wonder how much
longer to lunch.

11:31.750 --> 11:33.750
Yes, siree.

11:33.750 --> 11:35.958
Don't know why I didn't
think of it before.

11:35.958 --> 11:37.958
I'll blast him out.

11:39.291 --> 11:41.083
Yes, indeedie.

11:41.083 --> 11:44.708
Of course, uh, you have to
be careful with dynamite.

11:44.708 --> 11:46.500
Can't use too much.

11:46.500 --> 11:48.708
Just a little keg will do you.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.583
Only one keg?

11:50.583 --> 11:52.708
- Oh, dear.
- Uh-oh.

11:52.708 --> 11:55.000
Stand clear!

11:56.625 --> 11:58.166
You, too, Rabbit.

11:58.166 --> 12:00.708
Pooh: Uh, do you
think, perhaps,

12:00.708 --> 12:02.333
we should have told Gopher

12:02.333 --> 12:05.208
that we each
used one keg, too?

12:06.375 --> 12:09.000
Hello!

12:09.000 --> 12:11.250
Hello!

12:11.250 --> 12:14.833
Hmm. No sign
of hide nor bunny.

12:14.833 --> 12:17.000
I wonder where
old floppy ears went.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.875
Oh, dear. I hope he's
not angry with us.

12:19.875 --> 12:21.875
I believe we should
look for him,

12:21.875 --> 12:23.875
in case he's lost.

12:23.875 --> 12:26.833
Good idea. Follow me.

12:29.625 --> 12:31.958
No. He's not here.

12:33.708 --> 12:36.875
Oh, my. Ohh. Oh, my.

12:36.875 --> 12:38.458
Oh, dear, dear, dear,
dear, dear.

12:38.458 --> 12:39.875
Oh, no, no, no.

12:45.458 --> 12:47.875
And did you find
anything, Piglet?

12:47.875 --> 12:50.583
Well, uh, no.

12:50.583 --> 12:51.708
You, Pooh?

12:51.708 --> 12:54.458
Only this very nice rock.

12:54.458 --> 12:56.250
But no Rabbit.

12:56.250 --> 12:58.583
I came up zip, too.

12:58.583 --> 13:02.083
And I searched every one
of my holes to boot.

13:02.083 --> 13:05.333
I-- I found this.

13:05.333 --> 13:07.250
His favorite carrot.

13:07.250 --> 13:10.083
He never went
nowheres without it.

13:10.083 --> 13:12.750
We're just gonna
have to face it.

13:12.750 --> 13:15.000
Bunny boy is gone.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.708
He was the dagblasted
best rabbit friend

13:18.708 --> 13:20.083
I ever had,

13:20.083 --> 13:21.583
even if he was
the only rabbit friend

13:21.583 --> 13:22.875
I ever had.

13:22.875 --> 13:25.708
Perhaps we shouldn't
have blown him up.

13:25.708 --> 13:27.333
Then he wouldn't
have had to leave.

13:27.333 --> 13:29.958
Rabbit: Help! Help!

13:29.958 --> 13:31.291
- Help!
- Oh, my.

13:31.291 --> 13:32.583
I can still hear him calling.

13:32.583 --> 13:35.125
I must be having
hearlookinations.

13:35.125 --> 13:39.583
Help! Help! Help!

13:40.958 --> 13:44.250
I wonder if hearlookinations
are contagious.

13:44.250 --> 13:45.875
I hear Rabbit, too.

13:45.875 --> 13:47.583
So do I.

13:47.583 --> 13:49.583
Me, uh, too.

13:49.583 --> 13:51.875
Get me down from here!

13:51.875 --> 13:53.875
Yaah!

13:55.375 --> 13:56.875
Why, look.

13:56.875 --> 13:59.708
There's Rabbit's
hearlookination now.

13:59.708 --> 14:01.750
Gopher: Wait a minute.

14:01.750 --> 14:05.125
That's not Rabbit's
hearlookination.

14:05.125 --> 14:07.208
That's Rabbit in a tree.

14:07.208 --> 14:09.750
Hooray! Ha ha ha ha!

14:09.750 --> 14:13.375
Old floppy ears wasn't blown
to tangerines after all.

14:13.375 --> 14:17.166
Hey, watch where you're
bouncing, you big galoot.

14:17.166 --> 14:18.458
- Hoo hoo hoo hoo!
- Oh, my.

14:18.458 --> 14:19.833
Rabbit's so high up.

14:19.833 --> 14:21.833
How are we going
to get him down?

14:21.833 --> 14:26.875
Won't be easy,
but maybe this will help.

14:26.875 --> 14:28.625
Uh, chop me down?

14:28.625 --> 14:30.083
Yep.
Might be painful,

14:30.083 --> 14:31.583
but it could hurt a lot, too.

14:31.583 --> 14:33.583
No. We can't do that.

14:33.583 --> 14:35.083
Why, the tree might fall

14:35.083 --> 14:37.958
on an innocent plant
or something.

14:37.958 --> 14:39.708
Hmm. Good point.

14:39.708 --> 14:41.625
- Well, in that case--
- Aah!

14:41.625 --> 14:43.375
...I'll just have to
use dynamite again.

14:43.375 --> 14:46.083
Like my daddy
always used to say,

14:46.083 --> 14:49.000
what gets blown up
might get blown down.

14:49.000 --> 14:52.500
Rabbit: No, no!
Not dynamite again!

14:52.500 --> 14:56.208
You're right. Better
make it nitroglycerine.

14:56.208 --> 14:59.416
Wait. Uh, how about U235?

14:59.416 --> 15:02.083
I believe
I could get him down.

15:02.083 --> 15:05.083
You? All by your lonesome?

15:05.083 --> 15:07.708
He's right, Pooh.
Won't you want some help?

15:07.708 --> 15:09.958
Help?

15:09.958 --> 15:12.708
Oh, no.
I don't believe so.

15:12.708 --> 15:13.750
Just watch.

15:13.750 --> 15:15.583
Hello, Rabbit.

15:15.583 --> 15:17.000
Hmm? What?

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
Oh, hi, Pooh Bear.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.208
- Aah!
- See? I thought
it might work.

15:24.208 --> 15:25.500
Aah!

15:26.958 --> 15:29.500
You were right, buddy boy.

15:29.500 --> 15:31.750
Not only did you get
Rabbit out of the tree,

15:31.750 --> 15:33.583
you caught him, too.

15:35.583 --> 15:38.000
Here we are.
I think it's all right

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
for Rabbit to look
at our surprise now.

15:41.125 --> 15:43.250
Oh, my. Oh, my.

15:43.250 --> 15:44.875
It's wonderful.

15:44.875 --> 15:46.291
And for me?

15:46.291 --> 15:48.583
After everything
I've said to you?

15:48.583 --> 15:51.000
Well, you are
our friend, Rabbit,

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
whether you like it or not.

15:53.000 --> 15:56.750
How can I ever thank you
all for fixing it?

15:56.750 --> 15:59.875
Let me see. I know.

15:59.875 --> 16:02.125
Tigger, stop that.

16:02.125 --> 16:04.291
Say,
you know anything

16:04.291 --> 16:06.250
about the rest
of my dynamite?

16:06.250 --> 16:07.750
It's gone.

16:09.625 --> 16:12.416
Yes. I hid it
in a nice safe place

16:12.416 --> 16:15.083
where it can't blow up
any innocent gardens

16:15.083 --> 16:17.125
or rabbits.

16:17.125 --> 16:20.125
Uh, Rabbit, I found this
pogo stick in the woods,

16:20.125 --> 16:23.291
and I thought it might make
a nice garden warming gift,

16:23.291 --> 16:25.875
since you have a new garden
which needs warming.

16:25.875 --> 16:26.958
Here.

16:26.958 --> 16:29.000
Why, thank you, Pooh.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.375
How thoughtful.

16:30.375 --> 16:33.000
Can I try it, please?
Please? Please?

16:33.000 --> 16:35.375
No. It's my pogo stick.

16:35.375 --> 16:37.708
I get to pogo on it first.

16:37.708 --> 16:40.458
Maybe I can bounce
on you for once.

16:46.625 --> 16:50.166
Oh, my. Why does it
always happen to me?

16:52.000 --> 16:56.000
Gopher: Say, I bet I know
where you hid my dynamite.

17:05.625 --> 17:07.708
Tigger:
Come on, Piglet, old pal,

17:07.708 --> 17:10.208
tell us a scary
ghostly story,

17:10.208 --> 17:12.875
something full of,
uh, spookables

17:12.875 --> 17:14.583
and horribibble
creatures,

17:14.583 --> 17:18.375
uh, and things that go
shopping in the night.

17:18.375 --> 17:19.750
Oh, well, actually,

17:19.750 --> 17:22.125
I thought I might tell
a not-so-scary story,

17:22.125 --> 17:23.500
a story about a scientist.

17:23.500 --> 17:26.708
A mad scientist,
Pigalet?

17:26.708 --> 17:29.583
Oh, no. Not mad at all.

17:29.583 --> 17:32.458
Quite happy and cheerful,
really. Heh heh.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.708
Once upon a time...

17:36.708 --> 17:39.875
Tigger: Say, it's the middle
of broad daylight.

17:39.875 --> 17:42.375
Even a not-so-scary
scary story

17:42.375 --> 17:44.500
has to happen at night,
you know.

17:44.500 --> 17:47.625
Piglet: Oh, but this one
happens in the daytime.

17:47.625 --> 17:48.833
Tigger: Night.

17:48.833 --> 17:49.833
D-Day.

17:49.833 --> 17:50.875
Night.

17:50.875 --> 17:51.875
Day.

17:51.875 --> 17:52.875
Morning.

17:52.875 --> 17:54.166
Evening.

17:54.166 --> 17:56.000
Oh, dear.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.958
That's better.
Hoo hoo hoo hoo!

17:57.958 --> 17:59.708
Although
a nice thunderstorm

17:59.708 --> 18:00.875
would be nice.

18:00.875 --> 18:03.750
Y-Yes. Well, as I was saying,

18:03.750 --> 18:06.583
there was a very pleasant
and cheerful scientist.

18:07.958 --> 18:10.708
Mm-mm. Peanut butter
and jelly.

18:10.708 --> 18:12.125
My favorite.

18:12.125 --> 18:14.958
And it's so very good
for you, too.

18:14.958 --> 18:16.250
Tigger: Gasp.

18:16.250 --> 18:18.000
What is it? What is it?

18:18.000 --> 18:20.208
Why, this story
is so unscary,

18:20.208 --> 18:21.375
it's scary.

18:21.375 --> 18:22.708
I got better things to do

18:22.708 --> 18:24.083
than listen to this.

18:24.083 --> 18:25.875
I think I'll go
trim my toenails.

18:25.875 --> 18:28.958
Or better yet, I'll go
trim Pooh's toenails.

18:28.958 --> 18:31.875
Oh, Tigger, where
are your manners?

18:31.875 --> 18:33.291
I don't know.

18:33.291 --> 18:35.083
But I bet they're having
more fun than I am.

18:35.083 --> 18:37.083
Tigger, behave.

18:37.083 --> 18:39.416
Well, if you're going to have
a story about a scientist,

18:39.416 --> 18:41.875
he ought to at least be
doing something terribibble

18:41.875 --> 18:47.625
like creating
a boing-boing monster.

18:47.625 --> 18:49.958
A monster?

18:49.958 --> 18:53.708
Yeah. The monster Frankenpooh.

18:53.708 --> 18:55.583
Oh, d-d-dear.

18:55.583 --> 18:56.958
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!

18:56.958 --> 18:59.000
Absotutely perfect.

18:59.000 --> 19:03.125
Uh, but only he ought to be
a little bit bigger than that.

19:04.458 --> 19:06.458
No, even bigger.

19:06.458 --> 19:09.083
Biggerer!

19:09.083 --> 19:10.958
Oh, bother.

19:10.958 --> 19:13.958
Now that's what I
call a monster.

19:13.958 --> 19:16.708
- Hoo hoo hoo hoo!
- Oh, help! S-Save me!

19:16.708 --> 19:19.333
H-Help me! Oh, save me!

19:19.333 --> 19:22.083
Oh, dear. This is
so very terrifying.

19:23.166 --> 19:27.875
I...want...honey?

19:29.958 --> 19:32.583
Honey.

19:40.500 --> 19:42.333
A m-- A m...

19:42.333 --> 19:50.000
m-monster...

20:01.458 --> 20:03.708
Trembling in your socks,
are you?

20:03.708 --> 20:06.291
Clinging to the edge
of your seats, maybe?

20:06.291 --> 20:08.166
There was no stopping

20:08.166 --> 20:12.333
that gigantically
monstrous monstrosity.

20:13.583 --> 20:16.500
Honey.

20:16.500 --> 20:18.458
Oh, d-d-dear!

20:18.458 --> 20:21.000
Tigger, I'm afraid
this has become

20:21.000 --> 20:24.000
a not-at-all
so not-so-very-scary story.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
Perhaps I'd better tell it

20:26.000 --> 20:27.500
because I really think

20:27.500 --> 20:29.625
the monster shouldn't
be quite that size.

20:31.166 --> 20:32.875
Oh, you're right, Pigalet!

20:32.875 --> 20:35.500
He ought to be maybe
quadrupally as big.

20:38.250 --> 20:40.333
Uh, Tigger,

20:40.333 --> 20:43.166
I seem to have reached
the top of the picture.

20:43.166 --> 20:44.583
So you have.

20:44.583 --> 20:47.500
Maybe I ought to cut it
by a few feetsies.

20:47.500 --> 20:49.291
Thank you, Tigger.

20:50.625 --> 20:52.875
Tigger: And so
the monster was back

20:52.875 --> 20:55.875
on his unendingless
search for...

20:55.875 --> 20:57.708
Honey.

20:57.708 --> 21:00.583
There was no stopping
the thiefting beastie.

21:00.583 --> 21:03.875
Everybody was up
to their necks in arms

21:03.875 --> 21:06.250
because they knew
who was responsibibble

21:06.250 --> 21:09.583
for that terribibble monster
that was terrorizing them.

21:09.583 --> 21:12.583
Rabbit: It's that mad
Dr. von Piglet.

21:12.583 --> 21:15.500
Gopher: He's the one
that made the monster.

21:15.500 --> 21:18.583
- Let's boil him
in tomato juice!
- Yee!

21:20.125 --> 21:23.333
Piglet: Oh! No!
Stop this story!

21:25.000 --> 21:27.458
Please. It was an accident.

21:27.458 --> 21:30.583
I-- I didn't mean
to do it. Honest.

21:30.583 --> 21:34.291
I just wanted it to be
a nice not-so-scary story.

21:34.291 --> 21:35.708
But, Pigalet,

21:35.708 --> 21:38.583
there's nothing
to get so upset about.

21:38.583 --> 21:41.416
It was just a silly story.

21:41.416 --> 21:44.583
Of course, Piglet.
There was no monster.

21:44.583 --> 21:46.416
No one's angry at you.

21:46.416 --> 21:48.291
N-N-No?

21:49.958 --> 21:51.625
You really should
learn the difference

21:51.625 --> 21:54.291
between what's real
and what isn't.

21:54.291 --> 21:55.583
Shouldn't he, Pooh?

21:55.583 --> 21:58.333
Yes, Piglet,
you really should.

21:58.333 --> 22:01.083
And, uh, so should I.

22:01.083 --> 22:02.458
Oh, bother.
