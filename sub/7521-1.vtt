03:02.599 --> 03:05.852
Hey, sweetheart.
How about I dry you off?

03:17.447 --> 03:19.365
Whoa. Whoo!

03:19.533 --> 03:20.992
Hey, babe!

03:44.975 --> 03:46.809
Don't hit me.

03:50.147 --> 03:53.691
This is a message from Sinclair.
He's coming to your party tonight.

03:55.903 --> 03:57.028
That's great.

03:57.195 --> 04:00.990
So, what do we have now?
We have a critic, 2 clients, 3 painters.

04:01.199 --> 04:04.911
It should be 1 client, 2 clients and 3 more
clients, and Molly in the back room.

04:05.078 --> 04:07.538
You should know how to do business.
Give me a break here.

04:10.292 --> 04:12.418
I'm calling out for coffee.
Who wants what?

04:12.586 --> 04:16.672
I want a chocolate croissant,
a Sweet 'N Low and a coffee light.

04:16.839 --> 04:18.507
Okay. You, Liz?

04:19.009 --> 04:20.676
Hot tea with milk.

04:21.637 --> 04:23.012
Boss-man?

04:23.180 --> 04:27.516
I'll have a hot water with lemon
and Sweet 'N Low. Don't let them charge.

04:28.977 --> 04:30.102
Slimming down, tubs, hmm?

04:30.270 --> 04:33.522
I don't fast to lose weight.
I fast to save money.

04:34.942 --> 04:36.609
Every single time.

04:37.945 --> 04:40.321
If we don't sell any paintings,
we both go in the back.

04:40.530 --> 04:42.782
- Get the dip?
- Wine cheddar. Got it last night.

04:42.991 --> 04:44.367
So, what do we have now?

04:44.534 --> 04:46.661
Olives, crackers, pâté.
What else?

04:46.870 --> 04:49.956
Uh, French ticklers, Spanish fly,
margarine.

04:50.415 --> 04:54.126
- He's kind of shy. You can't do that.
- All right, so all right.

04:55.212 --> 04:58.214
- Bye, sweetie.
- So, what's his name, Michael?

05:14.398 --> 05:16.232
My God.

05:17.025 --> 05:18.651
Yuck.

05:18.819 --> 05:21.028
What's his name, Sinclair?
He's vegetarian.

05:21.571 --> 05:25.700
String beans, romaine lettuce,
asparagus, carrots, uh...

05:43.218 --> 05:45.886
Okay, all right. Okay.

05:46.096 --> 05:47.930
No more. Free, free, free!

05:48.140 --> 05:50.766
No charge. Okay, goodbye.

05:51.768 --> 05:53.269
Hello.

05:56.023 --> 05:58.315
Imagine one of those
caught in your throat?

05:58.775 --> 06:00.151
Imagine the songs they sang?

06:00.360 --> 06:01.819
Such a romantic.

06:02.029 --> 06:04.447
- Can I help you ladies?
- Half a dozen little birds.

06:04.614 --> 06:05.865
Lady, you clean me out.

06:06.074 --> 06:08.075
What are you going to do with them?

06:08.952 --> 06:10.995
What do you think we're going to do?

06:11.538 --> 06:12.788
Eat them.

06:13.832 --> 06:16.000
We plan to give them a proper burial.

06:20.172 --> 06:21.714
That's very funny.

06:21.923 --> 06:23.090
Seriously.

06:23.300 --> 06:27.595
Or maybe we'll raise them as
pets and then fly them from the rooftops.

06:29.973 --> 06:33.350
- Would you wrap them up?
- Yes, ma'am.

06:33.602 --> 06:35.561
- Just wrap them up.
- Yes, ma'am.

06:35.771 --> 06:37.772
Wrap them up, let's go.

06:38.648 --> 06:41.692
Let's see. What else?

06:41.943 --> 06:45.154
Fortune cookies. About eight?
No, um, 12.

06:45.322 --> 06:47.448
I'll just wrap them up with the rest.

07:02.964 --> 07:04.507
Say, cab!

07:24.778 --> 07:27.029
Stop, I'm pregnant!

07:27.906 --> 07:29.365
Cab!

07:52.222 --> 07:53.931
This thing's at eight, huh?

07:54.558 --> 07:56.642
Yeah, eight.

07:58.687 --> 08:01.230
Why don't you get comfortable
and I'll get it.

08:01.690 --> 08:04.066
Come on, shmuck, take your shirt off.

08:04.901 --> 08:07.194
Come on, I haven't got all night.

08:07.404 --> 08:10.447
I'll never let you talk me
into giving a dinner party again.

08:10.740 --> 08:12.867
It's good for you,
shows you're opening up.

08:13.952 --> 08:15.452
I'm fine.

08:15.704 --> 08:18.622
Next you'll be putting an ad
in the personals columns.

08:18.832 --> 08:19.915
Molly.

08:20.125 --> 08:21.292
"Beaut... " No.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.335
"Divorced White Female."

08:23.545 --> 08:25.713
Beautiful, statuesque blonde.

08:25.922 --> 08:29.258
"Witty, cultured, owns own vibrator..."

08:30.051 --> 08:32.219
Lizzy.

08:32.636 --> 08:35.431
I know you don't have one.

08:35.599 --> 08:36.932
Not vous.

08:37.433 --> 08:38.933
You are the grossest...

08:39.102 --> 08:40.186
Most perverted...

08:40.520 --> 08:42.730
- ...over-sexed, disgusting...
- Michael.

08:42.938 --> 08:43.981
Baby.

08:44.232 --> 08:45.649
Michael, yeah.

08:51.907 --> 08:53.449
He's eating Volkswagens.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.452
And I said to his press agent:

08:56.620 --> 08:58.662
"How do I review a piece like that?"

08:58.830 --> 09:03.626
- A Volkswagen tasting party?
- Michael, a little more wine? Uh, Michael?

09:03.793 --> 09:06.629
Leave your picture and résumé,
honey, we'll call you.

09:07.964 --> 09:09.840
Anyone can do this with his or her nose.

09:14.721 --> 09:17.097
She did it!

09:19.309 --> 09:22.519
Have you guys heard of this artist?

09:22.812 --> 09:24.647
- He's new.
- Is this a joke?

09:24.814 --> 09:27.733
Come on. Please everyone.
Let her tell the story.

09:28.568 --> 09:30.152
Elizabeth does not lie.

09:30.403 --> 09:31.654
- She's blushing.
- I'm not.

09:31.863 --> 09:34.573
There's going to be nudity
and violence in this one.

09:36.785 --> 09:38.744
A guy. He's an artist.

09:39.079 --> 09:42.122
- He's done a series of portraits.
- What kind of portraits?

09:42.332 --> 09:43.499
Rectal portraits.

09:44.834 --> 09:47.127
I know this man.
He pulls down his drawers...

09:47.295 --> 09:50.547
puts the brush up his bum
and paints portraits in a sort of...

09:50.757 --> 09:51.799
jack-knifed position.

09:53.176 --> 09:54.593
It's the most amazing thing.

09:54.803 --> 09:58.013
Sort of the way you write
your reviews, isn't it, Sinclair?

09:58.265 --> 10:00.432
Charming.

10:00.642 --> 10:02.351
She's very charming.

10:03.979 --> 10:05.604
To bow-Iegged women.

10:09.567 --> 10:12.403
Give I some wisdom, let I be wise

10:12.570 --> 10:17.074
Let I be wise
Let I be wise, wise, wise, wise, wise

10:17.242 --> 10:19.660
Savior, oh Lord

10:20.787 --> 10:24.206
I need some wisdom to open my eyes

10:25.208 --> 10:29.044
I want to climb to the mountaintop
To see it in your eye

10:29.212 --> 10:34.717
I just want to live wise
So I can live wise

10:34.884 --> 10:38.053
I just want to live life in your eyes

10:38.221 --> 10:39.555
Lord

10:39.723 --> 10:40.848
Savior

10:43.143 --> 10:46.854
It's only your wisdom that I know in me

10:47.230 --> 10:48.939
- It's beautiful.
- Isn't it? Yes.

10:49.107 --> 10:50.566
It's a beautiful shawl.

10:50.775 --> 10:52.318
It's a French shawl. Very old.

10:53.945 --> 10:56.405
- How much?
- $300.

10:56.948 --> 10:58.198
Is it really that much?

10:58.700 --> 11:01.285
It's rock bottom, sweetheart. $300.

11:02.412 --> 11:04.413
Three hundred's a good price.

11:04.581 --> 11:05.998
Thank you.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.042
So close to your light

11:08.209 --> 11:11.712
I just want to live in your heart

11:13.089 --> 11:14.089
Savior

11:16.718 --> 11:18.886
I would like to be moving on

11:24.559 --> 11:25.601
Savior

11:28.646 --> 11:30.731
Will you move me on?

11:31.775 --> 11:35.569
To where the eagle flies
To where the eagle flies

11:35.737 --> 11:42.242
Love, help them, mm
Who search out their ways alone

11:42.660 --> 11:46.622
Seeking wisdom like a child, oh

11:47.374 --> 11:52.669
I just want to live wise
So I can live wise

11:52.837 --> 11:57.049
I just want to live life in your eyes
Lord

11:58.551 --> 11:59.927
What is that?

12:03.473 --> 12:05.391
Aah! That's a baby.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.980
- How much is it?
- Uh, for you, 40 big ones.

12:12.148 --> 12:14.024
How about $30?

12:14.192 --> 12:15.275
$35.

12:15.819 --> 12:18.278
- How about 30?
- Okay.

12:20.490 --> 12:23.158
Every time I see you
you're buying chickens.

12:26.162 --> 12:27.704
Thirty?

12:29.374 --> 12:30.999
Every time I see you you're...

12:31.209 --> 12:32.584
What?

12:33.878 --> 12:35.045
You're smiling at me.

12:35.255 --> 12:36.839
Smiling at you?

12:39.342 --> 12:40.676
Thank you.

12:40.844 --> 12:42.636
So close to your heart

12:42.804 --> 12:46.432
I just want to live life in his light

12:47.517 --> 12:49.977
Savior, savior, savior, savior

13:36.399 --> 13:38.233
This place has a lot of history.

13:41.154 --> 13:42.654
The chair you're sitting in...

13:42.864 --> 13:44.948
was a guy named Gino Gambini...

13:45.158 --> 13:47.326
got his brains blown out...

13:47.744 --> 13:51.121
while he was eating the same thing
you're eating, linguine con cozze.

13:51.998 --> 13:53.332
There was another guy.

13:53.750 --> 13:56.627
This was earlier, this was in 1963.

13:56.836 --> 14:00.005
Did you ever hear of, uh, Vito Possolipo?

14:00.256 --> 14:01.757
- No, I haven't.
- No?

14:01.925 --> 14:04.092
- Would you like some more?
- I do like this wine.

14:04.260 --> 14:07.763
Vito Possolipo was sitting right over there,
where that baby is.

14:09.265 --> 14:13.352
He was minding his own business,
he was having a dish of zitti al forno.

14:13.937 --> 14:15.604
They came in...

14:18.441 --> 14:20.901
- You don't want any?
- No. Then what'd they do?

14:21.110 --> 14:23.195
Vito Possolipo came in...

14:26.533 --> 14:27.991
October 31 st.

14:29.035 --> 14:32.120
Halloween night, sitting in the back
minding his own business...

14:32.288 --> 14:35.874
- ...they came in, gunned him down.
- My God.

14:36.584 --> 14:39.920
I mean, this place is, like, uh,
what they call a family restaurant.

14:50.807 --> 14:52.349
Listen, uh...

14:55.270 --> 14:56.603
do you recognize this?

15:03.111 --> 15:04.444
John.

15:13.037 --> 15:14.121
It's for you.

15:24.132 --> 15:26.675
Don't say I didn't warn you, okay?

15:48.698 --> 15:51.700
- Is this yours?
- No, it's a friend's.

15:53.369 --> 15:54.620
Thanks.

15:56.539 --> 15:58.081
It's beautiful.

16:21.939 --> 16:23.398
It's so beautiful.

16:24.192 --> 16:25.525
It's nice.

16:46.673 --> 16:47.964
Is this your duck?

16:59.519 --> 17:01.728
You're taking a hell of a lot
for granted.

17:02.188 --> 17:03.438
Am I?

17:05.775 --> 17:08.609
Either that or you're practicing
to be a maid at Holiday Inn.

17:16.493 --> 17:18.119
Do you like music?

17:20.623 --> 17:21.832
Some.

17:29.966 --> 17:34.970
Southern trees

17:35.847 --> 17:40.642
Bear strange fruit

17:41.644 --> 17:45.647
Blood on the leaves

17:46.607 --> 17:48.775
And blood at the roots

17:48.943 --> 17:50.610
It's Billie Holiday.

17:54.490 --> 17:55.782
What do you do?

17:58.995 --> 18:00.996
I buy and I sell money.

18:02.498 --> 18:03.874
Some people call it arbitrage.

18:07.795 --> 18:08.962
What do you call it?

18:09.964 --> 18:11.715
I call it a living.

18:16.179 --> 18:19.347
So you sleep with a telephone
under your pillow?

18:20.016 --> 18:22.893
No, I don't do that.
I, uh, used to do that.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.353
I don't have to do that now.

18:26.564 --> 18:29.149
But your business
is very risky, isn't it?

18:32.195 --> 18:36.198
It's not any riskier than you
coming here.

18:36.657 --> 18:38.909
Out here where
there's no neighbors around.

18:39.118 --> 18:41.286
I mean,
we hardly know each other.

18:41.913 --> 18:43.079
I mean, I don't know you.

18:43.915 --> 18:45.749
You really don't know me.

18:46.751 --> 18:49.586
I mean, there's no taxi cab
waiting on the curb.

18:52.089 --> 18:54.132
There's no phone booth outside.

18:54.842 --> 18:57.260
There's no one to hear you
if you called out.

18:58.679 --> 19:00.305
There's just, uh...

19:01.057 --> 19:02.390
you and me.

19:06.020 --> 19:08.021
I don't like this.
I want to go home.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.068
I was just kidding.

19:14.779 --> 19:15.904
Now.

19:20.743 --> 19:23.703
Right.
We'll put this down here.

19:23.913 --> 19:25.914
We should go
black black, red red.

19:26.123 --> 19:29.459
From this end to that end.
Black black, red red, black black.

19:30.253 --> 19:33.380
I think the dog collar belongs here.

19:36.467 --> 19:38.718
It's not a dog collar.
It's a chastity belt.

19:39.887 --> 19:40.971
It is?

19:49.313 --> 19:51.398
Elizabeth.

19:52.441 --> 19:54.192
Someone sent you flowers.

19:55.194 --> 19:56.820
Don't put that one up.

20:06.956 --> 20:07.956
Where'd she go?

20:38.654 --> 20:39.988
Thank you, kind sir.

20:40.197 --> 20:42.073
Give me those balloons.

20:47.663 --> 20:49.497
Come with me.

20:49.790 --> 20:50.874
Please come with me.

20:51.083 --> 20:52.876
- Send her up?
- Take her up.

20:54.837 --> 20:55.879
Come on...

20:57.381 --> 20:58.673
John.

20:59.467 --> 21:00.508
Bye.

21:08.059 --> 21:09.434
John, I hate you.

21:14.732 --> 21:15.774
Stop it.

21:23.366 --> 21:25.200
Shall we get a cup of coffee?

21:26.202 --> 21:27.869
Let me down from here.

21:30.831 --> 21:33.166
John! You pig!

21:33.376 --> 21:34.876
See you later.

21:35.419 --> 21:37.045
Get me down!

21:37.880 --> 21:39.214
Why don't you calm down?

21:39.423 --> 21:42.300
- I mean it.
- Why don't you just calm down?

21:42.510 --> 21:44.052
Why don't you just...

21:44.887 --> 21:47.180
- Goddamn it!
- What is the matter?

21:48.057 --> 21:50.266
Leaving me up there like that.

21:54.188 --> 21:55.438
What is it?

22:04.865 --> 22:05.991
Slow down.

22:06.200 --> 22:08.576
I see someone coming.

22:09.412 --> 22:11.204
Take this sucker for $5.

22:11.414 --> 22:12.747
Maybe even 10.

22:16.293 --> 22:17.794
Stay with $5.

22:19.088 --> 22:21.589
Uh, sir. Do you like music?

22:21.882 --> 22:23.383
Do I like music?

22:23.926 --> 22:26.428
Look at these guys.
Who wants to know?

22:26.595 --> 22:29.639
My brother.
He can fart the theme from Jaws.

22:29.849 --> 22:31.224
He's really amazing.

22:31.434 --> 22:33.351
Wait a minute. He can what?

22:33.519 --> 22:36.938
He can fart the theme to Jaws. It's $5.

22:37.106 --> 22:38.565
It's $5?

22:38.774 --> 22:40.567
Five dollars,
I can go out and buy the record.

22:40.735 --> 22:41.943
It's too much.

22:42.111 --> 22:43.737
What about a buck?

22:44.947 --> 22:47.073
You can do this for a buck? Huh?

22:47.241 --> 22:49.284
Do it, then I'll give you the buck.

22:49.452 --> 22:50.744
Who can do it?

22:51.078 --> 22:52.954
I can, but we need
the money first.

22:53.122 --> 22:54.456
I'll tell you what...

22:55.708 --> 22:56.791
you hold the money.

22:56.959 --> 22:58.418
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

22:59.962 --> 23:01.796
Go ahead, hurry up, do it.

23:09.221 --> 23:11.806
Look at him, he looks
like he's going to take off.

23:15.728 --> 23:17.729
- That's it.
- That's it?

23:17.897 --> 23:19.939
That's it? What about:

23:22.985 --> 23:26.154
He only does the first couple of bars.

23:26.322 --> 23:28.740
- No, no. Give me the money back.
- Let's go.

23:46.592 --> 23:48.635
This is Dr. Holden's office.

23:48.803 --> 23:52.555
Just wanted to remind you, Elizabeth,
you have an appointment tomorrow.

23:54.141 --> 23:55.433
Hi, it's Doug.

23:55.601 --> 23:59.479
A bunch of us are going to Fire Island.
You want to come? Let me know.

24:04.151 --> 24:05.193
My dad and me.

24:05.361 --> 24:08.196
Uh, this is Carl Miller at Miller's Antiques.

24:12.910 --> 24:15.286
Hello, I waited till 10. Did you forget?

24:15.454 --> 24:16.704
I'll speak to you later. Bye.

24:17.873 --> 24:19.040
That's Bruce.

24:19.875 --> 24:21.543
He's a songwriter.

24:22.378 --> 24:24.045
And we were also married for 3 years.

24:28.300 --> 24:30.301
You going to ask me
how I feel about him?

24:30.928 --> 24:33.555
- Hello? Hello.
- No.

24:33.722 --> 24:36.850
- Shit, I hate these machines.
- Good.

24:38.227 --> 24:41.062
Lizzy, this is your mother. Remember me?

24:41.272 --> 24:43.648
- Dear, are you hungry for turkey?
- That's my mom.

24:45.025 --> 24:46.568
Will you take off your dress?

24:47.695 --> 24:48.736
What?

24:50.072 --> 24:51.489
Will you take off your dress?

25:27.443 --> 25:28.484
May I blindfold you?

25:42.791 --> 25:44.542
What if I don't want you to?

25:49.215 --> 25:51.257
Then you can ask me to leave.

25:53.302 --> 25:54.969
I don't want you to leave.

26:34.843 --> 26:35.927
Don't move.

26:37.388 --> 26:39.639
No, no, don't move.

26:41.058 --> 26:43.685
I want to look
at the outline of your body.

26:58.867 --> 27:00.201
Does this frighten you?

27:01.954 --> 27:03.204
Yes.

27:10.838 --> 27:12.005
Does this excite you?

27:14.758 --> 27:16.092
Yes.

27:17.052 --> 27:18.720
It does me too.

29:32.896 --> 29:36.149
Is he supposed to be dead or asleep?

29:37.901 --> 29:39.819
I think he's sleeping.

29:40.195 --> 29:41.863
I like to think he's sleeping.

29:51.290 --> 29:53.374
It's by Matthew Farnsworth.

29:54.334 --> 29:56.711
And nobody has heard of him, I know.

29:57.004 --> 30:00.256
But we're about to have a show
of his work here at the gallery.

30:00.466 --> 30:01.841
Very soon.

30:03.343 --> 30:05.636
I think he's a lovely artist.

30:10.726 --> 30:13.728
How about it? How do you feel?

30:16.940 --> 30:18.566
It just doesn't...

30:18.901 --> 30:20.985
I don't know how to say it.

30:21.862 --> 30:23.279
It just doesn't...

30:24.907 --> 30:26.032
Do you like it?

30:28.535 --> 30:31.245
So you'll have to come back.
Watch it.

30:32.581 --> 30:34.957
Great. I think he's dying to get out.

30:35.167 --> 30:37.043
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

30:37.252 --> 30:38.878
Come back and see us.

30:42.591 --> 30:44.258
Excuse me.

30:45.636 --> 30:47.470
Okay, boys.

30:48.597 --> 30:50.264
Look at that.

30:55.145 --> 30:56.395
Hi.

31:01.652 --> 31:03.819
- You smell good.
- Thanks.

31:27.177 --> 31:28.594
It's nice.

31:36.603 --> 31:39.855
- May I sit down?
- Of course. Make yourself at home.

31:45.320 --> 31:46.988
Some chair.

31:51.618 --> 31:52.868
You have a lot of TVs.

31:57.583 --> 31:59.584
My uncle died watching TV.

32:01.461 --> 32:03.504
He did.
He was a fanatic about sports.

32:04.298 --> 32:06.173
I mean, any sports.

32:06.675 --> 32:09.010
He had three TV's and a radio.

32:09.803 --> 32:13.848
He used to run from room to room just
so he wouldn't miss out on anything.

32:14.224 --> 32:16.726
He died of a heart attack,
'76 Olympics.

32:19.688 --> 32:22.857
I've come close to a heart attack
myself, watching these things.

32:24.568 --> 32:27.403
I used to live in hotels
before I lived here.

32:29.281 --> 32:31.032
But I do like to cook.

32:31.199 --> 32:33.034
- You like to cook?
- Love to cook.

32:38.874 --> 32:40.625
I bought this for you.

32:51.595 --> 32:53.054
Why don't you hand it to me?

32:53.805 --> 32:55.556
I like to watch you move.

33:04.316 --> 33:05.399
Okay.

33:22.918 --> 33:24.210
Open it.

33:45.774 --> 33:46.982
God.

33:48.819 --> 33:50.444
It's beautiful.

33:50.612 --> 33:52.113
I love it.

33:58.161 --> 34:02.289
They used to be able to hypnotize people
with the sound of ticking.

34:03.125 --> 34:04.333
You know that?

34:06.294 --> 34:07.628
Let me hear.

34:10.966 --> 34:12.299
I hear it.

34:12.509 --> 34:14.592
Can I ask you a question?

34:16.263 --> 34:17.471
Okay.

34:25.147 --> 34:26.981
It is beautiful.

34:40.370 --> 34:41.411
What?

34:46.543 --> 34:47.877
Elizabeth...

34:48.962 --> 34:50.545
each day at 12 o'clock...

34:51.005 --> 34:52.505
would you look at that watch...

34:52.716 --> 34:54.842
and think of me touching you?

35:02.809 --> 35:04.310
Yes.

35:07.147 --> 35:08.439
Would you do that for me?

35:11.443 --> 35:12.693
Yes.

35:19.534 --> 35:20.701
Liz?

35:21.870 --> 35:23.662
Sinclair's on the phone.

35:26.249 --> 35:27.333
Who?

35:28.251 --> 35:29.668
I don't believe she said that.

35:30.670 --> 35:32.421
God, what does he want?

35:32.839 --> 35:34.757
Ha. I don't know.

35:35.175 --> 35:37.718
But I think it's about Farnsworth.

35:37.886 --> 35:39.595
- Here.
- You're kidding.

35:40.138 --> 35:41.263
Hello.

35:42.057 --> 35:43.182
Sure, I'll hold.

35:44.226 --> 35:45.601
Such a jerk.

35:47.896 --> 35:49.563
I think I've been hypnotized.

35:50.982 --> 35:52.858
A diet doctor tried it on me once.

35:53.068 --> 35:54.527
I gained 10 pounds.

35:55.278 --> 35:57.404
But I can't concentrate.

35:58.198 --> 36:00.574
I sprayed Lysol
under my arms this morning.

36:02.410 --> 36:05.621
Did you, um, brush your teeth
with, uh, Ben Gay?

36:06.039 --> 36:07.248
Shaving cream.

36:07.415 --> 36:08.916
You're all right.

36:11.753 --> 36:16.131
Listen, your ex called. He wants to have
dinner with you tonight. Don't forget.

36:16.716 --> 36:18.968
No. I can't.

36:20.262 --> 36:24.098
Why not? I think you should.
He seems so sad lately.

36:25.767 --> 36:27.142
You go.

36:27.352 --> 36:28.978
You go in my place.

36:30.564 --> 36:32.356
I don't think I'm his type.

36:33.066 --> 36:34.608
Can I borrow your body?

36:37.779 --> 36:38.779
Hello?

39:14.227 --> 39:15.477
Molly.

39:17.105 --> 39:18.397
Molly.

39:20.233 --> 39:21.859
There's a man on the premises.

39:22.068 --> 39:24.945
Terrific. Great. Go to it.

39:37.375 --> 39:38.459
Are these yours?

39:39.461 --> 39:40.711
Yes.

39:42.922 --> 39:44.965
It's nice. Come here.

39:47.552 --> 39:49.303
I don't believe this.

40:20.752 --> 40:22.086
I'm starving. Are you hungry?

40:24.839 --> 40:26.006
Come on.

40:35.975 --> 40:37.267
Don't move.

40:40.021 --> 40:41.396
Stay right there.

40:53.368 --> 40:55.536
I want you to close your eyes.

40:55.745 --> 40:57.579
I want you to lie down
on the floor.

40:57.789 --> 40:59.706
Just lie down on the floor.

41:00.291 --> 41:01.500
Come on.

41:03.044 --> 41:04.211
Go ahead.

41:09.425 --> 41:10.801
Close your eyes.

41:21.229 --> 41:23.230
- Don't peek.
- I did.

41:38.413 --> 41:40.664
Promise to keep your eyes closed?

42:26.794 --> 42:28.170
I want a big one.

43:54.048 --> 43:56.425
Promise to keep
your eyes closed, please.

43:58.344 --> 43:59.553
Stick out your tongue.

44:01.389 --> 44:03.473
Further. Further.

44:06.185 --> 44:08.395
Further. Right.

44:09.147 --> 44:10.772
I'll put it right on the spot.

44:10.982 --> 44:12.774
Right on the spot.

44:13.443 --> 44:15.068
That's nice.

44:59.947 --> 45:03.450
Just, no. I should have said no.
No, no, no.

45:03.910 --> 45:05.786
I should have said no.

45:05.995 --> 45:08.080
And I would have if I could have...

45:08.289 --> 45:10.624
but I couldn't, so I didn't.

45:16.255 --> 45:17.297
You talking to me?

45:22.345 --> 45:25.347
Listen, Lizzy,
you remember when you, uh...

45:26.391 --> 45:29.309
suggested I keep
your date with your ex?

45:30.520 --> 45:33.438
Well, um, I did.

45:34.857 --> 45:37.025
And the thing is, I couldn't say no.

45:40.154 --> 45:41.738
I, uh...

45:44.534 --> 45:46.993
- ...slept with him.
- With Bruce?

45:47.203 --> 45:48.370
My Bruce?

45:53.000 --> 45:54.793
I just thought you should know.

46:01.509 --> 46:03.969
Your mom will like him.

46:04.262 --> 46:05.303
Mine did.

46:08.975 --> 46:10.892
Okay.

46:30.371 --> 46:32.998
I'm going to a party
tomorrow night with Molly.

46:34.041 --> 46:35.375
Will you come?

46:38.838 --> 46:40.130
Come on, John.

46:41.549 --> 46:43.884
No.

46:44.051 --> 46:46.261
Why not?

46:46.471 --> 46:48.555
I want you to meet my friend...

46:51.476 --> 46:53.935
I want you to meet my friends.
Don't you want to?

46:54.145 --> 46:56.146
I don't want to meet anybody.

46:57.190 --> 46:58.440
I don't want to.

46:59.025 --> 47:00.859
I just want to be with you.

47:08.284 --> 47:09.701
I'll start the dishes.

47:09.911 --> 47:11.453
Let me tell you something.

47:12.747 --> 47:13.955
You don't do dishes.

47:14.499 --> 47:17.542
You don't ever have to do dishes.
I'll do the dishes.

47:20.171 --> 47:22.214
And I'll buy the groceries.

47:23.090 --> 47:24.925
And I'll cook the food.

47:28.429 --> 47:30.055
And I'll feed you.

47:30.431 --> 47:32.599
And I'll dress you in the morning.

47:34.018 --> 47:35.352
I'll undress you at night.

47:37.230 --> 47:38.980
And I'll bathe you.

47:40.942 --> 47:42.734
I'll take care of you.

47:46.197 --> 47:48.448
And you can see
your friends in the daytime.

47:48.616 --> 47:50.617
I just want the nighttime...

47:50.826 --> 47:54.079
from now on to be ours.

48:08.344 --> 48:09.636
Yes.

48:12.557 --> 48:13.890
Okay, fine.

48:15.017 --> 48:16.643
Okay. I'll meet you.

48:23.818 --> 48:25.360
I have a friend I have to meet.

48:26.696 --> 48:28.446
That's okay.
I've got work at home.

48:29.365 --> 48:30.991
No, I don't want you to go.

48:32.159 --> 48:33.535
Would you please stay?

48:36.414 --> 48:37.622
Okay.

48:44.171 --> 48:45.630
Fetch, boy.

49:13.159 --> 49:15.827
Now you can afford
that bed that lets you read...

49:15.995 --> 49:18.204
eat, chat on the phone, watch TV...

49:18.414 --> 49:20.665
sleep and relax
at the touch of a button.

49:20.875 --> 49:23.293
Now you can afford
soothing gentle massage.

49:23.502 --> 49:26.671
Your own personal heat-control.
Total adjustability.

49:26.881 --> 49:30.133
At last an adjustable bed
at flat-bed prices.

51:08.566 --> 51:09.691
Hello.

51:10.985 --> 51:12.235
Hello?

51:15.656 --> 51:17.574
Hello?

51:17.742 --> 51:20.160
- Elizabeth?
- Yes.

51:20.661 --> 51:21.911
- Hi.
- Hi.

51:22.079 --> 51:24.831
Don't talk.
I have a question I want to ask you.

51:25.416 --> 51:26.541
Okay.

51:26.709 --> 51:28.918
You know, all the while
I was with my friend...

51:29.128 --> 51:30.754
I was just wondering, uh...

51:32.173 --> 51:33.965
what you were doing in there.

51:34.925 --> 51:38.678
I was wondering if perhaps maybe
you were going through my clothes...

51:38.846 --> 51:40.805
looking in my drawers...

51:41.682 --> 51:44.017
looking at the things in my closet.

51:45.394 --> 51:48.146
And I said,
"No, she's not that kind of a girl.

51:48.355 --> 51:50.023
She's a good girl."

51:50.691 --> 51:53.026
Good girls don't snoop, do they?

51:53.444 --> 51:56.196
So come on, you can tell me.

51:56.530 --> 51:59.240
Tell me if you've been a Nosy Parker.

52:00.117 --> 52:02.410
Hey, come on.
Really, I want to know.

52:02.703 --> 52:05.163
I'm your pal, right? So tell me.

52:06.207 --> 52:09.250
You can trust me. It'll be our secret.

52:10.836 --> 52:12.295
So tell me.

52:15.424 --> 52:16.674
Tell me.

52:18.552 --> 52:19.803
Yes.

52:22.389 --> 52:24.265
- Yes.
- What's that?

52:26.852 --> 52:30.063
- Yes what?
- Yes, I've been a Nosy Parker.

52:30.231 --> 52:31.815
Shame on you.

52:33.067 --> 52:34.901
I didn't think you'd be here.

52:37.238 --> 52:38.363
Why'd you do that?

52:39.323 --> 52:40.782
I'm sorry.

52:44.203 --> 52:46.287
You've been a very bad girl, Elizabeth.

52:46.497 --> 52:48.998
I want you to face the wall
and raise your skirt...

52:49.208 --> 52:50.917
because I'm going to spank you.

52:54.755 --> 52:56.172
You are kidding.

53:00.177 --> 53:01.636
I'm not kidding.

53:05.432 --> 53:07.183
My God.

53:18.821 --> 53:20.446
Who the fuck do you think you are?

54:06.118 --> 54:07.243
I'm coming.

55:36.583 --> 55:39.085
- Your breakfast is ready.
- Mm.

56:25.299 --> 56:26.674
Will that be cash or charge?

56:28.844 --> 56:30.136
Cash.

56:39.146 --> 56:43.066
John, aren't you going to ask me
how I like this?

56:45.319 --> 56:46.319
No.

57:04.254 --> 57:07.423
Did you take as good a care
of the others as you do with me?

57:13.180 --> 57:14.472
Did you?

57:56.557 --> 57:59.392
- Hey.
- Just go.

01:00:24.705 --> 01:00:26.580
I'm going to take care of you.

01:00:29.710 --> 01:00:30.876
Hot soup.

01:00:31.086 --> 01:00:32.378
It's good.

01:00:41.013 --> 01:00:42.430
How did you know?

01:00:44.182 --> 01:00:47.059
How did you know
I'd respond to you the way I have?

01:00:48.603 --> 01:00:50.813
I saw myself in you.

01:01:12.961 --> 01:01:14.128
You know what, Molly?

01:01:19.593 --> 01:01:21.802
I can't figure this guy out.

01:01:26.224 --> 01:01:27.975
You know, sometimes...

01:01:28.185 --> 01:01:30.353
it's so easy.

01:01:31.855 --> 01:01:33.481
I mean, it might be...

01:01:33.732 --> 01:01:35.775
it might be the tie they wear...

01:01:36.943 --> 01:01:39.362
or the books they read.
Or don't read.

01:01:39.571 --> 01:01:41.072
But you know.

01:01:41.490 --> 01:01:44.700
- Know what?
- What will end it.

01:01:48.038 --> 01:01:50.956
So you just file it away and you wait.

01:01:52.209 --> 01:01:54.335
And that sort of makes it bearable.

01:01:58.006 --> 01:01:59.799
But with this guy...

01:02:02.803 --> 01:02:04.303
Maybe it's true love.

01:02:06.306 --> 01:02:07.556
Maybe.

01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:00.920
Hi.

01:04:03.173 --> 01:04:04.632
I brought you some lunch.

01:04:06.009 --> 01:04:07.676
Pastrami...

01:04:08.011 --> 01:04:10.638
and oatmeal cookies.
Your favorite.

01:04:11.181 --> 01:04:12.431
What are you doing here?

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:16.477
I was just in the neighborhood and I...

01:04:16.686 --> 01:04:19.939
wondered how spent your days
without me.

01:04:21.441 --> 01:04:22.483
And now I know.

01:04:26.947 --> 01:04:29.281
Wow, you have such a big office.

01:04:35.747 --> 01:04:37.706
Your secretary is very attractive.

01:04:37.916 --> 01:04:40.626
I saw her, like, on the way in.

01:04:42.629 --> 01:04:44.463
Do you always buy her lunch?

01:05:03.650 --> 01:05:05.109
Don't let her leave.

01:05:22.002 --> 01:05:23.502
I love Wall Street.

01:05:23.670 --> 01:05:25.629
I do. Yes.

01:05:25.922 --> 01:05:28.424
- Why?
- I don't know.

01:05:28.883 --> 01:05:32.886
I love the gray flannel suits,
the shiny shoes.

01:05:35.307 --> 01:05:38.267
Sometimes I wonder what it'd be like
to be one of the guys.

01:05:40.437 --> 01:05:42.187
Yeah?

01:05:44.691 --> 01:05:46.191
Sometimes...

01:05:46.526 --> 01:05:47.776
Sometimes.

01:05:52.157 --> 01:05:54.366
Yeah, I can understand that.

01:06:21.811 --> 01:06:24.730
The lady wants to know what it'd be like
to be one of the boys?

01:06:26.066 --> 01:06:28.233
The crowd is going wild.

01:06:48.505 --> 01:06:51.924
Whoa. I don't believe this.

01:07:06.856 --> 01:07:09.149
Don't sit down next to me
looking like that. Jesus.

01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:12.861
- Stop it.
- I mean, you take it away.

01:07:14.447 --> 01:07:16.281
Just kidding.
You look really good.

01:07:16.449 --> 01:07:17.783
You look great.

01:07:45.562 --> 01:07:46.937
I'll tell you, my darling...

01:07:47.147 --> 01:07:48.689
it's a hell of a life.

01:07:49.983 --> 01:07:52.276
You work and you work and you work...

01:07:52.485 --> 01:07:54.445
and meet with people
you don't like...

01:07:54.654 --> 01:07:55.821
that you don't even know.

01:07:56.906 --> 01:07:58.741
That you don't even want to know.

01:07:59.868 --> 01:08:01.994
And they try to sell you things...

01:08:02.162 --> 01:08:03.746
you try to sell them things.

01:08:04.205 --> 01:08:08.333
Then you go home at night,
listen to the wife nag, the kids bitch.

01:08:08.835 --> 01:08:11.378
You turn up the TV,
you tune everything out.

01:08:11.588 --> 01:08:14.006
You get up the next day
and you start all over.

01:08:15.842 --> 01:08:17.176
I'll tell you...

01:08:18.344 --> 01:08:21.013
the only thing that keeps me going...

01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:24.183
is this chick.

01:08:24.350 --> 01:08:26.310
I got this chick.

01:08:26.519 --> 01:08:28.687
I got this unbelievable chick
on the side.

01:08:30.314 --> 01:08:33.692
I mean, she is so hot...

01:08:33.902 --> 01:08:35.652
I can hardly believe it.
I mean...

01:08:41.117 --> 01:08:43.202
She's got one of those
heart-shaped asses.

01:08:45.121 --> 01:08:47.872
There ain't nothing
like a heart-shaped ass.

01:08:49.751 --> 01:08:51.001
You ever have a chick...

01:08:52.212 --> 01:08:53.796
with a heart-shaped ass?

01:08:56.049 --> 01:08:57.049
I didn't think so.

01:09:02.305 --> 01:09:03.764
Don't.

01:09:05.809 --> 01:09:07.850
You're so fucking beautiful.

01:09:10.897 --> 01:09:14.191
You are.
You're so fucking unbelievably...

01:09:14.399 --> 01:09:16.734
absolutely beautiful.

01:09:18.154 --> 01:09:19.363
Give me that mustache.

01:09:33.627 --> 01:09:35.462
So shall we pick up some chicks?

01:09:36.256 --> 01:09:38.256
Hey, faggots!

01:09:38.633 --> 01:09:41.093
Come back!
Come back, you coward!

01:09:43.345 --> 01:09:44.595
Come on back!

01:09:45.932 --> 01:09:46.974
Shit!

01:09:51.938 --> 01:09:53.397
Run, John!

01:09:57.443 --> 01:09:59.152
Come on, you son of a bitch!

01:10:04.450 --> 01:10:06.368
Why did you pull me away?

01:10:06.578 --> 01:10:10.330
- I could've beat them up.
- I know, I know you could have.

01:10:11.958 --> 01:10:14.293
I could've done it.
I could've done it.

01:10:53.666 --> 01:10:55.500
Son of a bitch!

01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:20.067
Jesus!

01:11:31.454 --> 01:11:32.663
Son of a bitch!

01:11:32.872 --> 01:11:35.540
Goddamn it! Goddamn it!

01:11:39.170 --> 01:11:40.212
Did you see me?

01:11:40.421 --> 01:11:43.173
Did you see me? Did you see me?
Did you see me?

01:11:43.383 --> 01:11:45.968
I got him in the ass!
Did you see me? Did you?

01:11:46.177 --> 01:11:48.136
Did you see me? Did you?

01:11:48.346 --> 01:11:51.974
I love you. God, I love you.
God, I love you. God!

01:13:41.501 --> 01:13:42.834
- Molly.
- Yeah?

01:13:43.002 --> 01:13:44.836
Help me pick out
one of these mattings?

01:13:45.004 --> 01:13:47.005
Harvey said to stick to neutral colors.

01:13:47.423 --> 01:13:49.174
We could use
one of these textures...

01:13:49.342 --> 01:13:51.468
they're touchy-feely.
They got the rattan.

01:13:51.677 --> 01:13:52.677
Kind of like, uh...

01:13:52.887 --> 01:13:54.554
It's kind of like the tropical.

01:13:54.764 --> 01:13:56.973
Wait, look at these.
I'd die for these.

01:13:57.517 --> 01:13:59.601
Liz, would you help me out with this?

01:13:59.811 --> 01:14:03.396
These are the kinds you could feel.
We like these, don't we?

01:14:03.689 --> 01:14:05.023
I'll leave you alone.

01:14:05.191 --> 01:14:07.609
Ted, telephone.

01:14:11.322 --> 01:14:15.075
If it's my mother-in-Iaw, I'm out.
Please stop torturing me.

01:14:15.284 --> 01:14:16.785
- Help me. He's going to kill me.
- Aah!

01:14:18.704 --> 01:14:20.205
Outrage.

01:14:29.173 --> 01:14:31.758
- You like that?
- Yes.

01:14:34.303 --> 01:14:35.720
Then take it.

01:15:02.373 --> 01:15:03.999
- Do you like it?
- I do.

01:15:22.143 --> 01:15:23.226
I'm sorry.

01:15:26.522 --> 01:15:28.398
When can I have this delivered?

01:15:28.608 --> 01:15:30.942
You're in luck.
This display comes down tomorrow.

01:15:31.110 --> 01:15:32.444
Why?

01:15:33.237 --> 01:15:35.906
Because we're putting another one there.

01:15:36.741 --> 01:15:37.782
What's wrong with this?

01:15:37.950 --> 01:15:41.453
Nothing wrong with it.
Everybody likes that bed.

01:15:41.621 --> 01:15:43.205
Where you going to put it?

01:15:43.789 --> 01:15:45.332
We'll probably sell it.

01:15:45.541 --> 01:15:48.001
- Do you want it?
- I'd like it as soon as possible.

01:15:48.211 --> 01:15:50.921
In that case,
you only need give me the information.

01:15:52.048 --> 01:15:54.633
Have you a box spring and mattress?

01:15:54.842 --> 01:15:57.761
Bedding's in the other department,
but I can handle it for you.

01:15:57.970 --> 01:15:59.554
No, I would, uh, need...

01:15:59.764 --> 01:16:03.475
a nice hard mattress and box spring.
I'd like you to deliver it all together.

01:16:05.645 --> 01:16:08.438
But you will want to select it.

01:16:09.315 --> 01:16:10.440
No, I won't.

01:16:11.108 --> 01:16:12.192
Well.

01:16:13.778 --> 01:16:15.028
I need...

01:16:15.238 --> 01:16:16.446
What else do we need?

01:16:16.656 --> 01:16:18.240
Four big pillows.

01:16:18.449 --> 01:16:21.409
Would you like goose down
or Dacron pillows?

01:16:21.619 --> 01:16:22.744
Which do you prefer?

01:16:24.497 --> 01:16:26.164
Goose down is much nicer.

01:16:27.208 --> 01:16:28.625
Goose down.

01:16:29.835 --> 01:16:30.919
And the ticking?

01:16:32.588 --> 01:16:34.047
And the ticking.

01:16:36.384 --> 01:16:37.425
What about the ticking?

01:16:39.262 --> 01:16:41.680
It comes with it.
What kind do you want?

01:16:41.889 --> 01:16:43.556
What kind do they have?

01:16:43.933 --> 01:16:45.642
You want striped?

01:16:45.810 --> 01:16:46.851
What is ticking?

01:16:47.353 --> 01:16:49.020
If you don't know what...

01:16:49.939 --> 01:16:54.109
It's the cloth that covers
the mattress and the box spring.

01:16:54.318 --> 01:16:56.820
- I must have ticking.
- Yes.

01:16:57.029 --> 01:16:59.155
I would be very happy, if you'd...

01:16:59.365 --> 01:17:00.699
pick out the ticking.

01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:01.992
Certainly.

01:17:02.159 --> 01:17:03.660
Okay.

01:17:07.331 --> 01:17:08.915
Will that be all?

01:17:09.125 --> 01:17:10.208
One other thing.

01:17:10.376 --> 01:17:11.543
Sit down.

01:17:20.303 --> 01:17:21.594
You have beautiful toes.

01:17:22.346 --> 01:17:24.514
Beautiful toes run in the family?

01:17:30.730 --> 01:17:35.275
If my lady friend could lie on the bed,
would that be all right with you?

01:17:35.901 --> 01:17:36.901
Thank you.

01:17:37.153 --> 01:17:40.030
This bed is one of our most
popular ones.

01:17:47.872 --> 01:17:49.539
Just lie back.

01:17:56.005 --> 01:17:58.089
Just hold onto the headboard.

01:17:59.300 --> 01:18:00.842
You comfortable?

01:18:04.096 --> 01:18:06.222
Spread your legs for Daddy.

01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:09.851
You'll be happy to know you can have
it delivered Thursday or Friday.

01:18:10.644 --> 01:18:12.645
I just want a gander.

01:18:12.813 --> 01:18:14.314
And I'll personally guarantee...

01:18:14.523 --> 01:18:17.442
you can have the delivery
on Thursday.

01:18:17.693 --> 01:18:19.402
Spread your legs.

01:18:20.112 --> 01:18:21.488
I won't look.

01:18:21.697 --> 01:18:23.490
Nobody's looking.

01:19:18.671 --> 01:19:19.712
I'll take this one.

01:19:53.581 --> 01:19:55.874
Baby, take off your coat

01:19:59.170 --> 01:20:00.879
Real slow

01:20:05.134 --> 01:20:07.469
And take off your shoes

01:20:09.763 --> 01:20:11.890
I'll take off your shoes

01:20:15.895 --> 01:20:18.521
Baby, take off your dress

01:20:21.108 --> 01:20:23.943
Yes, yes, yes

01:20:25.529 --> 01:20:28.529
You can leave your hat on

01:20:43.964 --> 01:20:48.092
Go over there, turn on the light

01:20:50.054 --> 01:20:51.971
Hey, all the lights

01:20:54.308 --> 01:20:55.975
Come over here

01:20:58.270 --> 01:20:59.562
Stand on that chair

01:21:01.398 --> 01:21:03.107
Yeah, that's right

01:21:06.237 --> 01:21:09.864
Raise your arms up in the air

01:21:12.701 --> 01:21:14.619
Now shake 'em

01:21:16.539 --> 01:21:20.416
You give me reason to live
You give me reason to live

01:21:22.169 --> 01:21:27.590
You give me reason to live
You give me reason to live

01:21:38.686 --> 01:21:41.854
Suspicious minds keep talking

01:21:44.191 --> 01:21:47.485
They're trying to tear us apart

01:21:50.823 --> 01:21:53.533
They don't believe in this love of mine

01:21:56.328 --> 01:21:59.328
They don't know what love is

01:22:16.849 --> 01:22:19.976
Yeah, I know what love is

01:22:24.940 --> 01:22:26.816
Sweet darling

01:22:28.944 --> 01:22:36.492
You can leave your hat on

01:22:39.038 --> 01:22:42.915
- Baby
- You can leave your hat on

01:22:44.209 --> 01:22:47.209
You can leave your hat on

01:23:08.734 --> 01:23:10.485
There ain't no way

01:23:13.364 --> 01:23:16.364
You can leave your hat on

01:23:28.379 --> 01:23:31.756
Give me some reason to live

01:23:35.552 --> 01:23:40.098
- You can leave your hat on
- You can leave your hat on

01:23:45.479 --> 01:23:47.939
We've got to do something
about Farnsworth.

01:23:48.107 --> 01:23:51.943
I keep calling and calling,
and the man won't answer the phone.

01:23:53.112 --> 01:23:55.029
We've got three weeks.

01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:58.908
Harvey's going out of his mind.
I think you should see him, don't you?

01:23:59.535 --> 01:24:01.285
It's a good idea, you know.

01:24:32.651 --> 01:24:39.699
Mr. Farnsworth?

01:25:32.503 --> 01:25:34.128
Mr. Farnsworth.

01:25:35.130 --> 01:25:36.214
Hi.

01:25:37.257 --> 01:25:39.258
I tried to get in touch so many times...

01:25:39.468 --> 01:25:41.469
but your phone was off the hook.

01:25:43.096 --> 01:25:46.390
I just wanted you to know
that your show is in 3 weeks...

01:25:46.558 --> 01:25:49.060
and we still don't have
all your paintings.

01:25:50.979 --> 01:25:53.231
And we were hoping you'd come.

01:25:57.069 --> 01:25:59.111
You do remember about your show?

01:25:59.905 --> 01:26:01.489
I, uh...

01:26:01.657 --> 01:26:04.867
I remember to eat when I'm hungry...

01:26:05.077 --> 01:26:08.329
and I remember to sleep
when I'm tired.

01:26:12.376 --> 01:26:14.126
I saw your work.

01:26:15.712 --> 01:26:17.421
It's wonderful.

01:26:22.427 --> 01:26:24.428
I don't know what it is.

01:26:25.013 --> 01:26:27.390
The way you manage to capture a moment.

01:26:28.851 --> 01:26:31.310
It's the moment...

01:26:31.687 --> 01:26:33.688
a thing is so familiar...

01:26:36.066 --> 01:26:38.067
it is strange.

01:26:41.947 --> 01:26:43.239
Yes.

01:26:55.127 --> 01:26:57.879
Elizabeth, we're going to play a little game.

01:26:59.006 --> 01:27:01.591
I'm a man with a very big problem.

01:27:03.302 --> 01:27:05.177
Because, you see, I can't get excited.

01:27:07.264 --> 01:27:08.848
I can't get excited unless I see...

01:27:10.475 --> 01:27:14.854
you get on your hands and knees
and crawl across the floor.

01:27:17.482 --> 01:27:20.234
And I'm willing to pay a lot
to see you do that.

01:27:29.244 --> 01:27:30.703
Would you do that for me?

01:28:07.741 --> 01:28:09.700
This is stupid, John.

01:28:11.244 --> 01:28:12.536
Crawl.

01:28:16.625 --> 01:28:17.667
Crawl.

01:28:18.794 --> 01:28:19.835
I don't want to crawl.

01:28:20.212 --> 01:28:21.545
Get on all fours and crawl.

01:28:22.547 --> 01:28:24.757
I don't want to argue with you.

01:28:25.092 --> 01:28:26.133
Now crawl.

01:28:31.515 --> 01:28:33.140
Don't play with me like that.

01:28:33.350 --> 01:28:37.228
I don't want to negotiate with you.
Now crawl.

01:28:38.522 --> 01:28:40.147
John, it's only a game.

01:28:41.525 --> 01:28:43.234
- Crawl.
- No!

01:28:44.069 --> 01:28:45.861
- Crawl.
- Don't touch me!

01:28:46.071 --> 01:28:47.863
- Don't.
- Pick up the money.

01:28:49.741 --> 01:28:50.783
Pick up the money!

01:28:50.993 --> 01:28:52.868
I don't want to pick up the money!

01:28:53.078 --> 01:28:54.412
I don't love the money!

01:28:54.621 --> 01:28:56.038
Pick up the money.

01:29:00.836 --> 01:29:01.961
Here's the money!

01:29:04.089 --> 01:29:06.007
Elizabeth, you love this game.

01:29:09.177 --> 01:29:10.219
Don't you.

01:29:10.429 --> 01:29:11.595
- I hate it.
- Don't you love it?

01:29:11.763 --> 01:29:14.223
- I hate it!
- You love it.

01:29:17.561 --> 01:29:18.811
I hate it. It was...

01:29:19.271 --> 01:29:20.855
But you loved it.

01:29:21.064 --> 01:29:23.774
- I knew you'd love it.
- I didn't.

01:29:45.047 --> 01:29:47.339
Molly. Molly.

01:29:47.507 --> 01:29:49.050
Bruce is down there.

01:29:49.259 --> 01:29:52.303
Just tell him I'm not here,
and I don't feel like it.

01:29:53.138 --> 01:29:54.346
Lizzy.

01:29:55.140 --> 01:29:56.557
He's here for me.

01:30:25.837 --> 01:30:27.338
Hi, Bruce.

01:30:37.307 --> 01:30:40.101
Bye, Lizzy.
See you tonight at the opening.

01:31:33.363 --> 01:31:35.739
This is Doctor Holden's office again.

01:31:35.907 --> 01:31:37.867
You have another appointment tomorrow.

01:31:38.034 --> 01:31:40.661
That's two you've missed
we have to charge you for.

01:31:40.912 --> 01:31:42.830
Try to make this one, please.

01:31:45.083 --> 01:31:49.461
Meet me at the
Chelsea Hotel at 5 p.m. in room 906.

01:33:34.859 --> 01:33:36.193
Elizabeth...

01:33:36.361 --> 01:33:37.778
I love you.

01:33:37.988 --> 01:33:40.364
I have something
I want you to do for me.

01:33:40.532 --> 01:33:42.825
I want you to go to the drawer...

01:35:26.262 --> 01:35:28.889
That was a simple thing
I asked you to do.

01:35:34.646 --> 01:35:36.021
Now do it.

01:35:57.210 --> 01:35:58.669
Is that too tight?

01:35:59.254 --> 01:36:00.712
How does that feel?

01:36:09.180 --> 01:36:10.597
I love you.

01:38:56.097 --> 01:38:57.973
Bastard.

01:38:59.892 --> 01:39:03.186
You scared the shit out of her.
How does it feel?

01:39:03.354 --> 01:39:05.856
- You really wanna know?
- How does it feel to be out of control?

01:39:06.024 --> 01:39:07.566
You really want to know?

01:39:11.863 --> 01:39:13.530
What was it like?

01:39:13.698 --> 01:39:14.865
You want to know?

01:39:16.367 --> 01:39:17.701
Look, John!

01:39:42.393 --> 01:39:44.144
Any kind of pussy you wanna look at...

01:41:58.196 --> 01:42:00.572
Excuse me.
Can I have a little more red wine?

01:42:05.203 --> 01:42:07.537
Who needs more champagne?

01:42:09.874 --> 01:42:10.874
Take it.

01:42:23.054 --> 01:42:24.930
This is wonderful.

01:42:25.139 --> 01:42:26.807
Wonderful!

01:42:45.743 --> 01:42:49.037
The Times just arrived.
Please God, they give us a good review.

01:42:49.580 --> 01:42:51.998
I think they're taking pictures now.

01:42:52.208 --> 01:42:53.375
Are you ready?

01:42:53.584 --> 01:42:54.876
Come on.

01:42:55.920 --> 01:42:57.838
- Do I look all right?
- Wonderful.

01:42:58.047 --> 01:42:59.464
I think I'm drunk.

01:43:16.941 --> 01:43:19.192
Darling, Elizabeth!
For God's sake, help me.

01:43:19.402 --> 01:43:20.944
Help me, help me, darling.

01:43:21.153 --> 01:43:24.155
Farnsworth. He's so strange.

01:43:24.824 --> 01:43:27.158
Really strange. I love the work.

01:43:27.368 --> 01:43:29.077
I love the work. I even told him.

01:43:29.453 --> 01:43:33.707
But I don't know whether he's
sub-literate or pre-verbal or what...

01:43:33.916 --> 01:43:36.126
but he just stares.
Stares, dear.

01:43:36.335 --> 01:43:37.419
Creepy.

01:43:38.045 --> 01:43:39.462
Really creepy.

01:43:43.467 --> 01:43:45.385
This is the beginning
of the Farnsworth era.

01:43:45.595 --> 01:43:48.597
- He's a great painter.
- Bear with him.

01:43:48.764 --> 01:43:52.058
Why bear with me?
Come on, this is a great day.

01:43:52.268 --> 01:43:55.395
I'm proud of the show
and I'm proud to have you with us.

01:47:24.647 --> 01:47:25.855
You're leaving?

01:47:29.401 --> 01:47:30.693
You want to stay?

01:47:56.303 --> 01:47:58.304
You know, I have five brothers.

01:48:00.975 --> 01:48:02.642
I'm the youngest.

01:48:05.521 --> 01:48:08.565
And we lived in a small town.
It was just outside of Chicago.

01:48:10.693 --> 01:48:12.152
And my father, uh...

01:48:14.238 --> 01:48:15.947
My father was, uh...

01:48:18.409 --> 01:48:20.243
He worked at a foundry.

01:48:23.038 --> 01:48:27.083
And my mother was a, uh...

01:48:27.251 --> 01:48:28.793
She was a clerk in a, uh...

01:48:32.423 --> 01:48:34.090
She was a checkout girl
at a grocery store.

01:48:36.051 --> 01:48:38.094
So you know, it's just...

01:48:38.429 --> 01:48:40.054
I got a family.

01:48:42.391 --> 01:48:44.100
And, uh...

01:48:44.768 --> 01:48:46.144
They don't work anymore.

01:48:46.353 --> 01:48:48.438
They're retired. I support them.

01:48:56.113 --> 01:48:57.864
It's too late.

01:49:01.535 --> 01:49:03.745
You know, I want you to know something.

01:49:04.538 --> 01:49:07.498
I want you to know
there's been lots of other girls.

01:49:08.459 --> 01:49:10.251
There's been lots of women.

01:49:13.505 --> 01:49:16.049
But I never felt
anything like this before.

01:49:24.308 --> 01:49:25.850
Even when I just...

01:49:27.102 --> 01:49:29.145
hold you in my arms.

01:49:30.022 --> 01:49:31.481
It's just the way you feel.

01:49:32.942 --> 01:49:34.817
It's something I didn't count on.

01:49:37.696 --> 01:49:40.073
I never counted...

01:49:40.282 --> 01:49:42.116
on loving you so much.

01:49:52.795 --> 01:49:55.922
You knew it'd be over
when one of us said stop.

01:49:57.591 --> 01:49:59.384
But you wouldn't say it.

01:50:04.181 --> 01:50:06.349
I almost waited too long.

01:50:33.085 --> 01:50:35.586
I'll send someone to get my stuff.

01:50:40.551 --> 01:50:42.176
Elizabeth...

01:50:55.441 --> 01:50:57.066
I love you.

01:51:06.535 --> 01:51:08.536
Would you please come back...

01:51:10.080 --> 01:51:12.415
by the time I count to 50.

01:51:22.760 --> 01:51:24.260
One...
