00:06.100 --> 00:09.400
- She risked her life to save yours.
- I'm there for you, Molls.

00:09.720 --> 00:12.210
- Nice kettle, mate.
- Rolex.

00:12.230 --> 00:14.180
- How old are you?
- 18.

00:14.230 --> 00:15.740
Talk about easy targets.

00:15.790 --> 00:18.420
Bashira's father is clearly
in league with the insurgency.

00:18.470 --> 00:20.100
We're soul sisters.

00:20.150 --> 00:22.380
Am I going to die?

00:22.430 --> 00:24.620
- Move!
- Where have they taken her, Sir?

00:24.670 --> 00:26.892
They're willing to help
facilitate the removal of Bashira

00:26.893 --> 00:29.118
from her family and into
a safe house in Kabul.

00:29.170 --> 00:30.880
Things could have all been so different.

00:30.930 --> 00:33.490
- Well, lady luck was smiling on us.
- This time.

00:55.930 --> 00:58.480
Come on, Dawes! You're about
to go on a two week holiday.

00:58.530 --> 01:00.920
Have some human decency and
put some bloody effort in!

01:00.970 --> 01:03.720
Human decency? This is war innit?

01:03.770 --> 01:05.970
It's healthy competition. Now dig in.

01:26.350 --> 01:29.280
14 hours on a flight with the
wit and wisdom of the Smurf.

01:29.330 --> 01:31.840
You've won the lottery of life
getting R & R with me, Molls.

01:31.890 --> 01:33.400
You reckon?

01:33.450 --> 01:36.290
Do you want me to book us a couple
of tickets to the Mile High Club?

01:43.466 --> 01:45.826
Yes, Dawes!

02:00.706 --> 02:02.456
Tell you what, Dawes...

02:02.506 --> 02:03.936
Aw, shut up!

02:03.986 --> 02:05.786
I'm trying to tell a story!

02:07.426 --> 02:09.976
Will you guys shut up and get washing?

02:14.986 --> 02:17.146
What is your problem, face-ache?

02:26.646 --> 02:27.966
Oi!

02:30.206 --> 02:32.316
Sorry Boss, I thought it was Sohail.

02:32.366 --> 02:34.716
What, you wouldn't share
your breakfast with Sohail?

02:34.766 --> 02:35.996
No way.

02:36.046 --> 02:39.196
I'm not letting him dip
his spoon in my Coco Pops.

02:39.246 --> 02:41.516
I take it that's not meant
to be a euphemism, Dawes?

02:41.566 --> 02:44.326
If I knew what one of them
was, Sir, I'd let you know.

02:48.446 --> 02:50.276
Sohail is a well dodge geez.

02:50.326 --> 02:52.876
If I knew what one of
those was I'd let you know!

02:52.926 --> 02:55.126
I haven't had Coco Pops in bloody ages. Mm.

02:58.326 --> 03:00.366
- What?
- What?

03:02.486 --> 03:04.236
Captain James!

03:06.726 --> 03:09.756
We've not had comms from the
mountain checkpoint this morning.

03:09.806 --> 03:11.516
Kinders!

03:11.566 --> 03:13.196
Have they ever not responded before?

03:13.246 --> 03:15.836
Every morning they check in
and give me the night report.

03:15.886 --> 03:17.756
Today, nothing.

03:17.806 --> 03:19.156
If they'd had contact...

03:19.206 --> 03:21.886
This is serious enough
for the Special Forces.

03:23.686 --> 03:25.196
I'm going to need a medic.

03:25.246 --> 03:26.316
What's happened, Boss?

03:26.366 --> 03:29.436
There may well have been an
incident at the mountain pass.

03:29.486 --> 03:30.796
Kinders.

03:30.846 --> 03:32.646
2 Section. Double in. Full kit.

03:33.886 --> 03:37.646
This may well mean your R & R is
down the shitter I'm afraid, Dawesy.

04:07.207 --> 04:11.480
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

04:30.446 --> 04:32.086
Guys.

04:37.286 --> 04:38.686
It looks deserted.

04:40.406 --> 04:43.436
Maybe cos they've deserted, Boss Man.

04:43.486 --> 04:47.246
The other side offered 'em a
dollar more, that's what's happened.

04:48.526 --> 04:50.446
Something don't feel right, Sir.

04:54.606 --> 04:56.246
Taj. Azizi.

04:58.166 --> 05:01.836
The Afghan special forces
are going to investigate.

05:01.886 --> 05:02.996
Let's focus up

05:03.046 --> 05:05.166
until we know what's going on up there.

05:18.886 --> 05:20.686
Stand by for an ambush, fellas.

05:35.566 --> 05:37.916
Medic!

05:37.966 --> 05:41.116
Medic! Medic!

05:41.166 --> 05:42.486
Dawes!

05:46.166 --> 05:47.886
Let's go!

06:03.766 --> 06:05.526
Kinders!

06:13.406 --> 06:15.836
Examine and confirm death.

06:15.886 --> 06:17.486
He's just a kid, Qaseem.

06:20.246 --> 06:22.446
Examine and confirm death.

06:45.806 --> 06:47.126
No pulse.

07:06.486 --> 07:09.276
I think we all know what happened here.

07:09.326 --> 07:11.526
I don't care what they get
paid... it ain't enough.

07:13.526 --> 07:15.886
They're just kids, Smurf. It's sick.

07:17.766 --> 07:20.836
Got to be green on green.
They'd have radio-ed it in

07:20.886 --> 07:23.036
if they'd been contact.

07:23.086 --> 07:24.956
They shoot their own, don't they?

07:25.006 --> 07:27.156
Afghans.

07:27.206 --> 07:28.636
Mind you,

07:28.686 --> 07:30.606
they would shoot us given half a chance.

07:33.206 --> 07:35.436
Glad to see you're cutting down.

07:35.486 --> 07:38.756
I will do, one day.

07:38.806 --> 07:40.246
When there's less...

07:41.566 --> 07:43.286
jitterbug in my head.

07:46.526 --> 07:48.996
Do you reckon we'll still get home today?

07:49.046 --> 07:52.046
There's not much a medic
can do for them poor buggers.

08:09.522 --> 08:11.792
Er... a replacement medic is on her way.

08:11.842 --> 08:12.952
You leave in one hour.

08:13.002 --> 08:14.552
What, Boss?

08:14.602 --> 08:16.232
You're going home.

08:16.282 --> 08:17.602
Oh. OK.

08:18.682 --> 08:20.032
What's the matter?

08:20.082 --> 08:22.272
Nothing. It's just...

08:22.322 --> 08:24.832
they didn't deserve to die like that.

08:24.882 --> 08:27.232
One lad wasn't much older than Bashira.

08:27.282 --> 08:28.752
Well, he would have said he was 18

08:28.802 --> 08:30.842
or he wouldn't have been allowed to enlist.

08:32.962 --> 08:34.602
Do you think she's all right?

08:36.202 --> 08:37.602
Yeah, I do.

08:39.322 --> 08:40.952
I think you allowed her an opportunity

08:41.001 --> 08:42.722
she wouldn't have been given.

08:45.162 --> 08:46.962
I'd love to write to her one day,

08:48.882 --> 08:50.842
you know, when this is all over...

08:52.122 --> 08:53.952
Just to make sure she's all right.

08:54.002 --> 08:55.282
She'll be fine.

08:58.722 --> 09:00.792
How long do you think
you'll stay in for, Dawes?

09:00.842 --> 09:02.082
The army, Sir?

09:03.482 --> 09:05.432
Dunno.

09:05.482 --> 09:08.432
It's hard to plan ahead,
if you know what I mean.

09:08.482 --> 09:10.392
Like today,

09:10.442 --> 09:12.402
confirming those kids were dead...

09:16.482 --> 09:18.552
they shot my mate Rolex boy point blank.

09:18.602 --> 09:20.002
He never stood a chance.

09:22.362 --> 09:26.312
I just feel so sad about it all sometimes.

09:26.362 --> 09:28.642
Rolex boy, Bashira,

09:30.642 --> 09:32.952
I just wish that I could sort it all out.

09:33.002 --> 09:34.792
Don't think too much.

09:34.842 --> 09:36.872
Just do the job you're bloody good at

09:36.922 --> 09:38.922
and we'll be home by Christmas.

09:41.082 --> 09:44.682
Now, erm, I have a request for you!

09:45.762 --> 09:46.752
Boss?

09:46.802 --> 09:48.152
Well, I've have had my Nespresso

09:48.202 --> 09:49.832
machine sent over at great expense.

09:49.882 --> 09:51.272
To the taxpayer.

09:51.322 --> 09:54.392
Maybe, but completely justified
because I'm not a fully functioning

09:54.442 --> 09:56.992
soldier until I've had my first
shot of coffee in the morning.

09:57.042 --> 09:58.682
Tea bag does me, Boss.

09:59.762 --> 10:02.392
Now, Dawes, London...

10:02.442 --> 10:04.442
Nespresso shop on Regent Street.

10:06.242 --> 10:09.912
Go and buy me some Rosabaya coffee capsules

10:09.962 --> 10:13.392
and I will adore you for always.

10:13.442 --> 10:14.882
Always, Sir?

10:29.042 --> 10:30.722
Come back to me.

10:31.642 --> 10:33.242
I will.

10:34.242 --> 10:35.682
Don't worry.

10:45.402 --> 10:47.042
Hey, Boss Man!

10:48.682 --> 10:51.762
Hand over with the temp
medic and get your kit packed.

11:02.002 --> 11:05.192
Hey, Smurf. I want protein
shake, chocolate flavour.

11:05.242 --> 11:08.572
Some Marmite. A big bastard,
yeah? 500 grams minimum.

11:08.622 --> 11:11.072
Get us some more boxers. Like
anything, Primark will do.

11:11.122 --> 11:13.352
Ha-ha! Cos you've got
skiddies in the rest of 'em,

11:13.402 --> 11:15.792
- haven't you, Dangleberries?
- No, I used yours for that.

11:15.842 --> 11:17.032
Bring back eye drops, Molly.

11:17.082 --> 11:19.032
This dust's getting in
my eyes and I'm in agony.

11:19.082 --> 11:21.152
I'd say that's the early
stages of cataracts!

11:21.202 --> 11:24.872
- I swear that's where we did basic training, innit?
- Catterick!

11:24.922 --> 11:27.392
Sensodyne toothpaste, the
one dentists recommend.

11:27.442 --> 11:31.072
We are going on our bloody
holidays so would you lot kindly... ?

11:33.762 --> 11:36.282
- Good luck you two.
- Where's Sohail?

11:37.722 --> 11:40.512
- He's gone AWOL.
- I fucking knew it.

11:40.562 --> 11:42.992
Taliban. You should have let
me shoot him on day one, Boss.

11:43.042 --> 11:44.872
I'll pretend I didn't heard that.

11:44.922 --> 11:46.792
Might have saved the
lives on the mountains.

11:46.842 --> 11:49.392
Maybe if we find him we can
invoice him for the four body bags.

11:49.442 --> 11:51.312
Oi, behave.

11:51.362 --> 11:52.832
Am I right or I am I right, Boss?

11:52.882 --> 11:54.872
It's not always that straightforward.

11:54.922 --> 11:56.842
"We are not wholly bad or good... "

12:00.922 --> 12:02.042
Go.

12:04.282 --> 12:05.872
See you later, suckers!

12:08.642 --> 12:10.802
- Don't forget the toothpaste!
- See you later!

12:18.842 --> 12:21.282
If Sohail's gone AWOL then

12:21.283 --> 12:23.002
- something might happen!
- Go.

12:23.005 --> 12:25.752
- But you might going to need a medic.
- We might going to already got one!

12:25.802 --> 12:27.682
- Well, she ain't me.
- Dawes.

12:36.682 --> 12:38.112
I can't go.

12:38.162 --> 12:40.522
Go. That's an order.

12:42.002 --> 12:44.402
I need that bloody coffee.

13:39.618 --> 13:41.648
You all right?

13:41.698 --> 13:43.938
- I dunno.
- You what?

13:45.458 --> 13:47.488
Too many people are dying.

13:47.538 --> 13:49.688
What you talking about?

13:49.738 --> 13:53.458
Nothing. I just can't get
this morning out of my nut.

13:57.178 --> 13:59.258
We'll be home soon.

14:00.738 --> 14:02.488
Can't wait to meet your family.

14:02.538 --> 14:04.568
Well, that's never
going to bleeding happen.

14:04.618 --> 14:06.248
Don't fight it.

14:06.298 --> 14:08.048
What exactly am I fighting?

14:08.098 --> 14:09.498
Your feelings for me.

14:10.538 --> 14:11.808
Just for clarity,

14:11.858 --> 14:14.168
if you were the last
bloke on the entire globe

14:14.218 --> 14:16.808
and you had a face and
a personality transplant,

14:16.858 --> 14:18.608
I'd still rather go without.

14:18.658 --> 14:22.008
You say that, but you
wouldn't be able to resist.

14:22.058 --> 14:23.738
Feed them swans baby!

14:27.538 --> 14:29.608
I'll get my mum to give you a lift.

14:29.658 --> 14:30.848
You're all right.

14:30.898 --> 14:32.138
I know I am.

14:34.378 --> 14:37.728
Anyway, it's time you met my family.

14:37.778 --> 14:39.968
You deluded, big-eared, Welsh prannit.

14:40.018 --> 14:42.138
I'm a fucking war hero.

14:43.458 --> 14:45.568
What's a prannit?

14:45.618 --> 14:47.058
Dunno. I'll ask my nan.

14:57.778 --> 14:59.978
Touch me again and I'll break your arm.

15:02.818 --> 15:05.618
- Maybe if we weren't in the same platoon...
- Zip it.

15:24.738 --> 15:25.858
Hi, Mum.

15:52.658 --> 15:54.498
Are you OK?

15:56.618 --> 15:59.018
I never thought I'd see him again, Molly.

16:00.338 --> 16:02.538
You know we lost his brother out there?

16:03.738 --> 16:05.338
Yeah, yeah, I do.

16:06.698 --> 16:09.568
When his brother died,

16:09.618 --> 16:10.928
they knocked on my door

16:10.978 --> 16:13.808
and said there'd been an incident.

16:13.858 --> 16:17.848
They said they'd got him
back to Camp Bastion Hospital.

16:17.898 --> 16:21.538
They said he was stable but serious.

16:22.698 --> 16:26.338
And then they came back later and
said he'd died of his injuries.

16:27.578 --> 16:29.298
I'm sorry.

16:31.578 --> 16:33.808
With Smurf,

16:33.858 --> 16:37.808
they knocked on my door and
said there'd been an incident.

16:37.858 --> 16:40.258
They'd got him back to
Camp Bastion hospital

16:42.618 --> 16:44.218
and they said he was stable.

16:47.578 --> 16:50.448
And then they never came
back and knocked on my door.

16:50.498 --> 16:51.898
That's shit. I'm sorry.

16:53.658 --> 16:55.018
Couldn't wait to see him...

16:57.658 --> 16:59.178
... and to hold him.

17:02.658 --> 17:06.008
Did I make a prize tit
of myself at the airfield?

17:06.058 --> 17:07.488
You made a prize tit out of him!

17:13.778 --> 17:15.058
What?

17:39.338 --> 17:41.048
Where you going, Moll?

17:41.098 --> 17:42.898
I'm just going to jump out here.

17:44.018 --> 17:46.208
Why? We can just drop you at the station.

17:46.258 --> 17:47.928
It's only a two minute walk...

17:47.978 --> 17:50.568
To be honest I could proper
do with stretching my legs.

17:50.618 --> 17:51.768
Are you sure?

17:51.818 --> 17:54.048
Yeah, yeah. It's what I want. I promise.

17:54.098 --> 17:56.648
The station's only round
there. I recognise it.

17:56.698 --> 17:59.258
I've been sitting on me
arse now for 20 hours.

18:02.738 --> 18:04.368
I'll text you, yeah?

18:04.418 --> 18:06.528
I'll be in the Earl of
Wakefield having Jagerbombs

18:06.578 --> 18:08.488
and you'll still be schlepping to Newport.

18:08.538 --> 18:10.528
Do you even know where Newport is?

18:10.578 --> 18:12.018
I don't know, don't care.

18:18.818 --> 18:20.258
Let go of me then, you spam.

18:21.578 --> 18:23.368
Thank you, Mrs Smurf.

18:23.418 --> 18:25.488
Take care, love.

18:25.538 --> 18:26.808
See you later.

18:26.858 --> 18:28.098
See you later.

18:34.738 --> 18:36.378
She's lovely.

18:37.498 --> 18:39.488
She your girlfriend?

18:39.538 --> 18:41.448
Don't get fucking involved, Mother.

18:41.498 --> 18:44.688
How am I getting involved?

18:44.738 --> 18:46.208
Do you want a drink?

18:46.258 --> 18:47.368
Yeah, go on.

18:47.418 --> 18:48.818
What do you want?

18:49.898 --> 18:51.288
Anything.

18:51.338 --> 18:52.488
Well, what?

18:52.538 --> 18:54.728
- Anything!
- Well, Coke or Fanta or... ?

18:54.778 --> 18:56.898
Anything! Fucking anything!

18:59.058 --> 19:00.498
Anything!

19:24.738 --> 19:27.568
Hi, can I have a number
for a cab company please?

19:27.618 --> 19:29.208
I'm...

19:29.258 --> 19:31.018
I don't have a clue where I am.

20:44.898 --> 20:46.968
Mum?

20:47.018 --> 20:48.848
Yeah, I'm two minutes away!

20:48.898 --> 20:52.258
Here, what's happened to the
Earl of Wakefield? It's gone!

21:08.418 --> 21:11.298
Molly, hi!

21:12.418 --> 21:16.968
Hiya. Oh, hello. Hello, mate.

21:17.018 --> 21:18.928
All right?

21:18.978 --> 21:21.648
Here, Dad, I hope you've got the
hot water on, I need a shower.

21:21.698 --> 21:22.968
I'm minging!

21:23.018 --> 21:25.018
Help her with her bags, then.

21:26.378 --> 21:27.778
Hello, Molls.

21:40.198 --> 21:43.728
Don't do this on the landing.
I told you. Go down there.

21:43.778 --> 21:45.178
Go down there.

21:46.298 --> 21:48.008
Is that better?

21:48.058 --> 21:51.128
Yeah, I think that's most of
the dust and shit and sand out!

21:51.178 --> 21:53.688
The water going down
the plug hole was yellow!

21:53.738 --> 21:57.368
Wish I could have a shower and
get rid of all my dust and shit.

21:57.418 --> 22:00.448
Although it'll take more than
that to make me feel better.

22:00.498 --> 22:02.208
Why, are you unhappy?

22:02.258 --> 22:04.088
I'm all right, but...

22:04.138 --> 22:06.048
Does anybody want a drink?

22:06.098 --> 22:07.568
No, I'm all right, thanks, Dad.

22:07.618 --> 22:09.728
We'll crack right on it later though yeah?

22:09.778 --> 22:11.728
What's happened to the Wakefield?

22:11.778 --> 22:15.008
It's going to be apartments, they reckon.

22:15.058 --> 22:16.778
Another nail in me coffin.

22:23.258 --> 22:25.848
He can still drink down
the Central can't he?

22:25.898 --> 22:27.968
Or the Denmark Arms or is he still barred?

22:28.018 --> 22:29.608
Stop pretending you don't get it.

22:29.658 --> 22:30.928
What?

22:30.978 --> 22:33.528
I got friends telling
me I've got potential.

22:33.578 --> 22:35.968
You can still have potential
at my age, can't you?

22:36.018 --> 22:37.368
Yeah.

22:37.418 --> 22:38.768
Exactly.

22:38.818 --> 22:41.288
But I can't if your dad's
going to be a complete bell end.

22:41.338 --> 22:44.848
You will support me won't you,
Molls, like I've supported you?

22:46.418 --> 22:49.128
- Right, Shazza's outside.
- Who?

22:49.178 --> 22:51.648
- The one I've been telling you about!
- What, the one who... ?

22:51.698 --> 22:53.848
Yeah, exactly! She's been
really good to me, Molls.

22:53.898 --> 22:56.338
And I've right needed her what
with you being away an all.

23:03.298 --> 23:04.688
You shouldn't have!

23:04.738 --> 23:07.088
I enjoy spoiling you all.

23:07.138 --> 23:09.808
Oh, you must be Molly. I'm Shazza.

23:09.858 --> 23:12.408
I'm just going to take
this in to the kitchen.

23:12.458 --> 23:14.528
So kind of her, innit, Molls?

23:14.578 --> 23:16.248
So kind of you, Shazza.

23:16.298 --> 23:17.648
She don't look like a Shazza.

23:17.698 --> 23:19.698
Well, what does a Shazza look like?

23:20.858 --> 23:23.698
Tats and a bit more meat on the bone.

23:25.658 --> 23:28.648
Well, actually I was born Felicity Baron.

23:28.698 --> 23:30.568
Married and became Felicity Middleson.

23:30.618 --> 23:33.808
But I'm nobody's property so
I chose a name that suited me.

23:33.858 --> 23:37.288
I suppose Lady Gaga ain't
her real name either.

23:37.338 --> 23:39.288
It's good to meet you, Molly.

23:39.338 --> 23:42.528
And I'm really sorry for what you're
having to go through at the moment.

23:42.578 --> 23:44.688
What do you mean?

23:44.738 --> 23:47.288
Afghanistan. I went on the march.

23:47.338 --> 23:51.018
"Not in my name". But I guess
you had no other options.

23:52.938 --> 23:54.808
Shazza works at the primary.

23:54.858 --> 23:57.768
Don't you think your mother would
make a wonderful teacher, Molly?

23:57.818 --> 23:58.808
A teacher?

23:58.858 --> 24:00.728
Well, teaching assistant!

24:00.778 --> 24:03.528
Every journey starts with a first step.

24:03.578 --> 24:04.968
Shazza's got faith in me.

24:05.018 --> 24:07.928
It's no matter of faith,
Mum. It's a matter of GCSEs.

24:07.978 --> 24:11.008
I think she'd make a great
addition to the profession.

24:11.058 --> 24:14.218
Right, I'm going to go get
the onions out the camper van.

24:15.658 --> 24:17.178
I'm going to make a soup.

24:19.618 --> 24:22.248
Sounds nice?

24:22.298 --> 24:24.288
She makes her own soup?

24:24.338 --> 24:25.568
Be nice.

24:25.618 --> 24:28.048
And she's got a camper van!

24:28.098 --> 24:30.808
She's sticking her hooter in a
bit, ain't she? Getting involved.

24:30.858 --> 24:32.608
Well, getting involved is a good thing...

24:32.658 --> 24:34.608
And she cares about me.

24:34.658 --> 24:36.168
Well, I care about you.

24:36.218 --> 24:38.138
Yeah, but you're not here are you?

24:39.538 --> 24:42.488
I just want everything to be the same, Mum.

24:42.538 --> 24:43.778
Well, you're not.

24:50.298 --> 24:53.298
Sang Chill Bazi? I always win...

24:54.538 --> 24:57.248
You could write Bashira
a letter if you want.

24:57.298 --> 24:58.488
Why?

24:58.538 --> 25:00.648
Well, she's probably
never had a letter before.

25:00.698 --> 25:02.648
Well, can she read?

25:02.698 --> 25:04.168
No.

25:04.218 --> 25:05.938
That'll be why then.

25:11.778 --> 25:14.258
Am I going to die?

25:23.058 --> 25:24.448
Do you like onion soup?

25:24.498 --> 25:26.208
Is that what that honk is?

25:26.258 --> 25:28.768
Thought Dave was skinning
up in the kitchen.

25:28.818 --> 25:30.888
Now Molly, are you going
to have some of my soup?

25:30.938 --> 25:32.408
My nan was just telling me

25:32.458 --> 25:35.368
that you've become a part
of the furniture round here.

25:35.418 --> 25:38.768
Well, I'm your mum's friend and
when a friend asks for guidance...

25:38.818 --> 25:42.288
What, like her becoming a teacher?
That's never going to happen.

25:42.338 --> 25:46.688
Teaching assistant and yeah,
it can happen. Quite easily.

25:46.738 --> 25:49.048
Not when she's got a baby.

25:49.098 --> 25:52.088
She's also got a husband
who can lend a hand, surely?

25:52.138 --> 25:54.288
What's that got to do with you?

25:54.338 --> 25:56.248
All I'm saying, Molly,
is why can't she have

25:56.298 --> 25:58.648
something that she can
be proud of in her life?

25:58.698 --> 25:59.928
You've got your army.

25:59.978 --> 26:01.728
Oh, it's my army?

26:01.778 --> 26:04.658
- Well, you joined.
- Have you got a problem with that?

26:08.298 --> 26:10.818
Thanks to us there hasn't been another 7/7.

26:13.618 --> 26:15.738
There wasn't one before 7/7.

26:23.218 --> 26:25.458
- I'm so sorry.
- It's fine.

26:27.498 --> 26:30.488
I say, that's the first
time we've ever agreed

26:30.538 --> 26:32.288
with your dad on anything.

26:32.338 --> 26:34.368
- Eh?
- She needs being rolled in a carpet

26:34.418 --> 26:36.778
and lobbed off a bridge onto the M25.

26:42.058 --> 26:43.898
You had any of her soup?

26:46.938 --> 26:49.608
What do you think about Mum going to work?

26:49.658 --> 26:51.808
I think she needs a
check up from the neck up.

26:51.858 --> 26:54.928
You don't think she's started
batting for the other side, do you?

26:54.978 --> 26:57.008
Not that there's anything
wrong with that...

26:57.058 --> 27:01.608
I wouldn't say no if that Princess
Grace of Monaco took a fancy to me.

27:01.658 --> 27:04.128
In her prime, of course. Not now.

27:04.178 --> 27:06.138
She's dead, isn't she?

27:12.458 --> 27:14.088
All right, Moll?

27:14.138 --> 27:15.818
My mother's a lesbian.

27:19.178 --> 27:20.848
Come to Newport.

27:20.898 --> 27:22.008
Is it on the tube?

27:22.058 --> 27:25.448
Newport? Bloody English!

27:25.498 --> 27:27.848
If it's past Barnet then I ain't coming.

27:27.898 --> 27:29.368
Come over.

27:29.418 --> 27:32.448
I'm just sat in my room.

27:32.498 --> 27:34.288
Might as well be in Afghan to be honest.

27:34.338 --> 27:36.088
But I'm supposed to be getting some rest

27:36.138 --> 27:38.418
and recuperation from the likes of you.

27:42.018 --> 27:45.618
Molls, no-one else understands.

27:53.738 --> 27:55.338
OK, I'll come.

28:13.658 --> 28:16.448
Ditch the flowers, you noofter.

28:16.498 --> 28:18.428
There you are. You don't like them?

28:18.478 --> 28:20.208
Bin. Now.

28:20.258 --> 28:23.738
- You joking?
- What is this? A Tampax advert or something?

28:25.698 --> 28:27.928
Beer?

28:27.978 --> 28:30.498
You pisshead Taffs. Go on, then.

28:38.618 --> 28:40.688
So how many people you killed then?

28:40.738 --> 28:42.408
Loads mate,

28:42.458 --> 28:45.058
and I'll add you to the list if
you carry on staring at my tits.

28:47.058 --> 28:48.298
You all right?

28:50.178 --> 28:51.528
Yeah. You?

28:51.578 --> 28:55.008
Sort of. Don't feel...

28:55.058 --> 28:56.538
Normal?

28:57.938 --> 29:00.248
How long until everything
gets back to normal?

29:00.298 --> 29:01.848
It can't, can it?

29:01.898 --> 29:04.088
I think we just put Afghan in a little box

29:04.138 --> 29:05.968
and shove it under the stairs.

29:06.018 --> 29:08.568
Out of our minds.

29:08.618 --> 29:13.168
And don't go near that fucking box,
that's when you get proper fragged.

29:13.218 --> 29:15.448
How do you think they're all doing?

29:15.498 --> 29:17.728
I don't like it that
they're there without us.

29:17.778 --> 29:19.048
We all need to be together.

29:19.098 --> 29:22.408
Let's hope they've caught
old scar face Sohail.

29:22.458 --> 29:25.168
Dunno if he pulled the trigger
but he definitely had something

29:25.218 --> 29:28.008
to do with what happened
at the mountain pass.

29:28.058 --> 29:30.328
I knew from the off that he was Taliban.

29:30.378 --> 29:32.928
He could have already pulled
another little stunt...

29:32.978 --> 29:36.338
It don't bear thinking about.
This R & R is unbearable.

29:41.858 --> 29:43.498
We've got each other.

29:44.738 --> 29:47.978
You better get over
here Smurf, it's £89.20.

29:52.298 --> 29:53.808
Right then you shitheads!

29:53.858 --> 29:56.248
Way-hey!

29:56.298 --> 29:57.688
Cheers, Boss.

29:57.738 --> 30:00.168
Come on, get that down you, Smurf.

30:00.218 --> 30:02.008
Come on, come on, Smurf!

30:02.058 --> 30:05.818
Way-hey!

30:20.898 --> 30:23.088
What's up?

30:23.138 --> 30:25.968
No-one can ever know, not really.

30:26.018 --> 30:27.928
What?

30:27.978 --> 30:30.008
It's impossible to explain, innit.

30:30.058 --> 30:32.848
There we go, we got to
look after each other.

30:32.898 --> 30:34.328
Well, I'm looking after you.

30:34.378 --> 30:35.938
I know that.

30:37.698 --> 30:39.448
You agree with me?

30:39.498 --> 30:40.938
You're my mate.

30:42.778 --> 30:44.528
I'm glad you came down to see me.

30:44.578 --> 30:46.048
I'm glad too.

30:46.098 --> 30:49.568
Although I have to be honest Smurf,
Newport is a bit of a shit hole.

30:49.618 --> 30:50.898
Hey, don't push your luck.

30:54.418 --> 30:57.728
I'm going to show you the most
beautiful sight in the world.

30:57.778 --> 31:00.968
Well, where are we going?
It's not the countryside is it?

31:01.018 --> 31:03.978
I hate the countryside.
Trees give me the willies.

31:09.258 --> 31:10.898
I love a bit of Laugharne, me.

31:12.978 --> 31:14.288
Not too shabby, eh?

31:14.338 --> 31:15.778
It's all right.

31:17.058 --> 31:19.128
Most important place in the world to me.

31:19.178 --> 31:21.258
That's why I had to share it with you.

31:23.018 --> 31:24.978
We scattered my brother here.

31:26.538 --> 31:28.928
Boss Man stood just
about where you are now.

31:28.978 --> 31:31.168
Captain James was here?

31:31.218 --> 31:32.968
And he liked it, yeah?

31:33.018 --> 31:34.648
Loved it.

31:34.698 --> 31:36.978
Loves Dylan Thomas.

31:39.338 --> 31:41.418
That's where he wrote all his stuff.

31:43.818 --> 31:46.688
Captain James knew all about
it and he read a bit of it

31:46.738 --> 31:48.338
when we scattered Geraint.

31:50.338 --> 31:51.658
It was...

31:53.938 --> 31:55.138
Perfect.

31:58.578 --> 32:01.818
He always knows what to do
to make everything just right.

32:04.218 --> 32:07.088
The Boss Man's spot on.

32:07.138 --> 32:09.328
It's fluke.

32:09.378 --> 32:11.288
Every bloody thing.

32:11.338 --> 32:12.778
It's fluke.

32:13.978 --> 32:16.808
Where we're born, who you meet,

32:16.858 --> 32:19.488
who you fall in love with.

32:19.538 --> 32:21.168
It's all fluke.

32:21.218 --> 32:23.688
We're here Smurf but anything could happen.

32:23.738 --> 32:27.528
One of us could stand
on a mine, or get sniped,

32:27.578 --> 32:29.888
or green on blue, anything.

32:29.938 --> 32:32.288
Like you getting the battle
casualty replacement call

32:32.338 --> 32:34.128
and joining the Under Fives...

32:34.178 --> 32:36.048
And if I hadn't joined the Under Fives...

32:36.098 --> 32:37.928
We'd never have got back together.

32:37.978 --> 32:39.498
Don't push it, mate.

32:44.698 --> 32:47.808
I done a project on butterflies
when I was in primary school.

32:47.858 --> 32:49.488
They only live for a day, don't they?

32:49.538 --> 32:51.248
No, that's mayflies.

32:51.298 --> 32:52.848
See them stingers there,

32:52.898 --> 32:55.008
that's where butterflies
like to lay their eggs.

32:55.058 --> 32:56.928
Then them eggs turn into caterpillars,

32:56.978 --> 32:59.808
then the caterpillars turn
into butterflies. Bosh.

32:59.858 --> 33:01.568
What?

33:01.618 --> 33:03.338
The life cycle of a butterfly.

33:05.498 --> 33:07.498
You learn something new every day.

33:08.858 --> 33:12.128
Pirbright. Afghan. Shot or fragged.

33:12.178 --> 33:14.898
Prison. Life cycle of a squaddie!

33:16.858 --> 33:21.488
Catterick. Afghan. War hero. Knighted.

33:21.538 --> 33:23.248
Big bastard house in Newport.

33:23.298 --> 33:25.568
Life cycle of me.

33:25.618 --> 33:28.128
I think that's the life
cycle of someone a bit higher

33:28.178 --> 33:30.608
up in the chain of command than you, mate.

33:30.658 --> 33:31.768
Maybe the Boss Man.

33:31.818 --> 33:34.128
Except he would never move to Newport.

33:34.178 --> 33:35.488
You never know.

33:35.538 --> 33:36.768
I think we do.

33:36.818 --> 33:39.568
Captain James would never
really mix with the likes of...

33:39.618 --> 33:40.898
The likes of us?

33:41.898 --> 33:44.018
The likes of you I was more thinking.

33:46.778 --> 33:48.568
Fate's thrown us together.

33:48.618 --> 33:50.088
Captain James?

33:50.138 --> 33:51.978
Me and you.

34:09.018 --> 34:12.208
Molls, I've got an idea.

34:12.257 --> 34:14.208
Let's go London.

34:14.257 --> 34:16.138
We need to be together.

34:17.818 --> 34:19.447
What did he read?

34:19.498 --> 34:20.568
Who?

34:20.618 --> 34:23.818
The Boss Man? At Gerhaint's funeral.

34:27.338 --> 34:30.007
"We are not wholly bad or good,

34:30.058 --> 34:32.768
who live our lives under Milk Wood,

34:32.818 --> 34:35.888
and Thou, I know, wilt be the first

34:35.938 --> 34:38.898
to see our best side, not our worst."

34:48.818 --> 34:52.338
I'll look after you,
don't you worry about that.

34:57.378 --> 34:58.888
Where we going?

34:58.938 --> 35:00.688
London.

35:00.738 --> 35:02.568
- Am I coming?
- Yeah, course.

35:02.618 --> 35:04.728
How else am I supposed to
look after your ugly mug

35:04.778 --> 35:06.288
if you're hundreds of miles away.

35:06.338 --> 35:08.218
Classic!

35:12.258 --> 35:15.848
Why would anyone want to
live in a shithole like this?

35:15.898 --> 35:18.648
It's sort of beautiful in its own way.

35:18.698 --> 35:21.168
No, mate. Sort of...

35:21.218 --> 35:23.088
shit.

35:23.138 --> 35:27.408
Well, you're a know-nothing
Newport wank stain.

35:27.458 --> 35:30.128
What you going to do with
your deployment money?

35:30.178 --> 35:31.848
Dunno.

35:31.898 --> 35:34.888
I'm going to Vegas.
I'll have about 14 grand.

35:34.938 --> 35:37.008
And I'm going to stick
the fucking lot on red.

35:37.058 --> 35:38.648
You know, the roulette wheel.

35:38.698 --> 35:40.848
And I'll walk away with 28 grand.

35:40.898 --> 35:42.538
Tidy!

35:43.818 --> 35:46.928
Come with me to Vegas and I'll
let you put the money on for me.

35:46.978 --> 35:48.608
You can bring me luck.

35:48.658 --> 35:50.448
I ain't got anything to wear.

35:50.498 --> 35:53.568
I'll get you something nice. Red and silky.

35:53.618 --> 35:54.728
Mm, classy.

35:54.778 --> 35:57.368
All dressed up like a gangster's
moll, walk into the casino

35:57.418 --> 35:58.888
and whack my dough down.

35:58.938 --> 36:00.578
That does sound cool.

36:10.258 --> 36:12.488
That's a proper binding contract, that.

36:12.538 --> 36:14.808
You and me to Vegas.

36:14.858 --> 36:18.328
Might have even persuaded
you to marry me by then.

36:58.538 --> 37:01.088
You asleep, Mum?

37:01.138 --> 37:02.928
What's the matter?

37:02.978 --> 37:04.488
Where's Dad?

37:04.538 --> 37:06.968
He's gone to sleep downstairs.

37:07.018 --> 37:08.888
Smurf's down there.

37:08.938 --> 37:11.128
Well, he'll sleep somewhere...

37:11.178 --> 37:13.658
Or he'll sit up all night drinking.

37:17.738 --> 37:19.458
What's going to happen, Mum?

37:24.298 --> 37:26.408
You used to snuggle in with me every night.

37:26.458 --> 37:28.048
Yeah, until you had all them

37:28.098 --> 37:30.968
other little bleeders then
there was no room for me.

37:31.018 --> 37:33.618
I love you lot. I do.

37:34.618 --> 37:36.728
I love you to bits...

37:36.778 --> 37:38.978
But why can't I have a job and have kids?

37:40.258 --> 37:42.288
I'd be home by lunch time.

37:42.338 --> 37:44.968
Is it too much to ask your dad to help out?

37:45.018 --> 37:47.088
No, I don't think it is.

37:47.138 --> 37:48.768
Really?

37:48.818 --> 37:50.328
I wanted to reach out an all.

37:51.698 --> 37:53.408
I could have stayed at the nail bar

37:53.458 --> 37:56.088
but I wanted to try something different,

37:56.138 --> 37:58.208
see if I could do it.

37:58.258 --> 38:00.048
You've done well for yourself.

38:00.098 --> 38:01.738
I'm having a go.

38:03.738 --> 38:06.938
She's helping me believe in myself, Shazza.

38:08.498 --> 38:10.768
I mean, God knows why.

38:10.818 --> 38:14.208
Sometimes you can become friends
with someone that you never

38:14.258 --> 38:16.688
thought you could ever be friends with.

38:16.738 --> 38:21.208
And the differences just
disappear and just being with them

38:21.258 --> 38:23.528
makes you happy.

38:23.578 --> 38:25.098
I knew you'd understand.

38:26.778 --> 38:29.218
Just don't let her ruin anything here.

38:31.378 --> 38:34.048
Well, why would she do that?

38:34.098 --> 38:37.688
She's coming in between
you and the people you love.

38:37.738 --> 38:39.578
You still love Dad, don't you?

38:40.618 --> 38:42.328
Yeah.

38:42.378 --> 38:45.648
I mean, he makes me wonder
why half the time but

38:45.698 --> 38:47.528
he's all right.

38:47.578 --> 38:48.818
Good.

38:52.778 --> 38:56.052
Tell me the truth, do you
think I should knock it

38:56.053 --> 38:57.288
on the head and just... ?

38:57.338 --> 39:00.258
What? Carry on washing Dad's pants? No.

39:01.858 --> 39:04.488
No, just go for it.

39:04.538 --> 39:07.288
Just let Dad know he's
loved and he'll be there.

39:07.338 --> 39:09.978
He'll lend a hand. I know he will.

39:22.178 --> 39:24.048
Argh, give me your toes!

39:24.098 --> 39:26.608
Argh, num-num-num!

39:26.658 --> 39:29.288
Right, there's bacon, bread, eggs...

39:29.338 --> 39:30.848
Are the eggs free-range, Mum?

39:30.898 --> 39:32.168
That's a myth. Beans.

39:32.218 --> 39:33.568
What's a myth?

39:33.618 --> 39:36.288
It's something what's
bollocks, that's what a myth is.

39:36.338 --> 39:38.408
Can I just say, Molls?
You got a good un there.

39:38.458 --> 39:39.928
Nan, I'm a trained killer.

39:39.978 --> 39:43.088
Say anything stupid and
I'll render you speechless...

39:43.138 --> 39:45.128
Oi, take it from someone who knows,

39:45.178 --> 39:48.128
a good un comes along once
a life time if you're lucky.

39:48.178 --> 39:50.488
I ballsed up and chose your grandad cos

39:50.538 --> 39:52.048
he had a Triumph Herald.

39:52.098 --> 39:53.688
I let the good one go.

39:53.738 --> 39:57.208
So if that Triumph Herald
hadn't come down the road at that

39:57.258 --> 40:00.048
precise moment in time, then
you'd be with your good un?

40:00.098 --> 40:02.968
And I'd have never had all
that grief from your grandad.

40:03.018 --> 40:05.648
And me and mum wouldn't exist.

40:05.698 --> 40:07.728
Swings and roundabouts, I suppose.

40:07.778 --> 40:10.608
Come here, you little monkeys!

40:10.658 --> 40:14.328
Dinosaur! Rawr!

40:14.378 --> 40:17.498
Argh, no, I'm a monster,
not a horse any more!

40:21.938 --> 40:25.768
Seen Nan's come round with
the moody food? All nicked.

40:25.818 --> 40:28.288
You all right?

40:28.338 --> 40:30.648
Fighting fit.

40:30.698 --> 40:32.848
Might join the bleeding army.

40:32.898 --> 40:34.658
What with your back?

40:40.858 --> 40:43.538
You don't know what
you've got until it's gone.

40:46.178 --> 40:49.488
I'm trying to be really
nice and everything, Moll.

40:49.538 --> 40:52.968
Well, maybe you got to be nice
for as long as you've been a twat.

40:53.018 --> 40:54.568
But I've always been a twat.

40:54.618 --> 40:57.218
I thought that's what
your mum loved about me.

40:58.858 --> 41:03.008
Why can't she just stay at home
and teach our own kids reading?

41:03.058 --> 41:06.688
Cos she wants to go to a school
and do it and be appreciated

41:06.738 --> 41:08.968
and feel like she's moving on up.

41:09.018 --> 41:10.808
I don't want her moving on up.

41:10.858 --> 41:14.818
Dad, if you hold her hand
you'll move up with her.

41:19.178 --> 41:21.178
That's what's happening to me.

41:23.978 --> 41:25.778
Who's holding your hand?

41:26.818 --> 41:29.608
Well... I mean the army.

41:29.658 --> 41:31.138
Where you going?

41:34.018 --> 41:35.618
She's right, you know.

41:39.018 --> 41:41.808
Everyone's a fucking smart
arse all of a sudden, eh?

42:09.298 --> 42:11.688
Do you need any help?

42:11.738 --> 42:14.528
This... this whole shop is just for coffee?

42:14.578 --> 42:16.098
Yes, Madam.

42:17.138 --> 42:18.458
There you go.

42:19.978 --> 42:22.458
Rosabaya. Certainly, Madam.

42:26.258 --> 42:28.138
Look after her, Smurfy.

42:29.138 --> 42:30.688
I'll do my best.

42:30.738 --> 42:33.528
Mum, I'll text you when I get to Brize.

42:33.578 --> 42:36.418
Here, I'll take him.

42:41.298 --> 42:42.528
Love you.

42:42.578 --> 42:44.608
Love you.

42:44.658 --> 42:46.378
All right, mate?

43:27.378 --> 43:30.528
Back safe! Anything can
happen in that London!

43:30.578 --> 43:32.888
He looks like the cat who's got the cream.

43:32.938 --> 43:35.648
He's been hanging out of her
back doors all R & R, believe me.

43:35.698 --> 43:37.408
I reckon!

43:37.458 --> 43:39.288
- What was that?
- Well, have a look!

43:39.338 --> 43:41.872
We said goodbye to the boy
and hello to the man, Sir!

43:41.873 --> 43:42.873
Way-hey!

43:45.618 --> 43:47.728
No need to bother unpacking by the way.

43:47.778 --> 43:49.698
We're going back to Bastion.

43:54.098 --> 43:55.888
All right, boys?

43:55.938 --> 43:57.808
Your eye drops are in there.

43:57.858 --> 43:59.648
Oh, cheers, Molls. Let's have 'em, then.

43:59.698 --> 44:00.848
You all right, Boss?

44:00.898 --> 44:02.368
All right, Dawes.

44:02.418 --> 44:05.328
Eggy says we're out of here,
back to Bastion for the duration.

44:05.378 --> 44:07.168
That's right. You should probably do

44:07.218 --> 44:09.928
a hand over with the temp
medic. Helicopter's waiting.

44:09.978 --> 44:11.728
Yes, Boss.

44:11.778 --> 44:13.338
Double away then.

44:21.218 --> 44:22.608
So no news on Sohail?

44:22.658 --> 44:24.528
Nah. Still AWOL.

44:24.578 --> 44:26.928
I was worried he might try something.

44:26.978 --> 44:29.168
If anyone knows our secrets, it's him.

44:29.218 --> 44:30.848
He ain't tried anything yet.

44:30.898 --> 44:32.448
Maybe he's just lying low...

44:32.498 --> 44:34.048
waiting for you to come back.

44:34.098 --> 44:35.898
Don't say that. That's creepy!

44:38.458 --> 44:41.448
How the hell did Mansfield
Mike slice his forehead?

44:41.498 --> 44:44.088
Apparently he was shaving
gangsta nicks into his eyebrows

44:44.138 --> 44:47.968
when someone burst a balloon
behind him and made him jump.

44:48.018 --> 44:50.528
I bet the Boss weren't too happy?

44:50.578 --> 44:54.148
Mainly because gangsta nicks
are banned in the military.

44:54.498 --> 44:56.608
- You ready?
- Yeah.

44:56.658 --> 44:58.648
See you later, Molls.

44:58.698 --> 45:00.098
Thanks, Jackie.

45:03.378 --> 45:05.048
You OK?

45:05.098 --> 45:07.058
Yeah. Why wouldn't I be?

45:08.818 --> 45:10.848
I'm glad to be back. Felt weird.

45:10.898 --> 45:13.448
I couldn't get my head back into "normal".

45:13.498 --> 45:16.168
What, so you're glad to
be back to "abnormal"?

45:16.218 --> 45:18.728
I see your boots are wearing in all right?

45:18.778 --> 45:20.208
What?

45:20.258 --> 45:23.448
I can see in here you haven't had
your blisters checked by the medic.

45:23.498 --> 45:26.168
Well, maybe you can give
them the once over later.

45:26.218 --> 45:29.008
See these are the medical
emergencies that I've missed, Sir.

45:29.058 --> 45:32.048
Out here in Afghan, I'm at the
cutting edge of this conflict

45:32.098 --> 45:33.898
with your blisters.

45:36.138 --> 45:38.018
Are you really glad to be back?

45:39.498 --> 45:41.018
I wanted to come back.

45:43.498 --> 45:47.138
Oi, Molly, you went to bloody
Newport and you weren't a hostage?

45:49.138 --> 45:51.088
You went to Newport?

45:51.138 --> 45:53.928
Old Smurf is a silver-tongued cavalier...

45:53.978 --> 45:55.858
Sorry, Sir, didn't see you here.

45:59.818 --> 46:03.008
So, how big a shit hole is it then?

46:03.058 --> 46:07.778
Dawesy and Smurfoid sitting
in a tree... K-I-S-S-I-N-G.

46:09.578 --> 46:11.328
It's like being back at school!

46:11.378 --> 46:12.738
Ooh, someone's tired.

46:14.818 --> 46:16.208
What have you said?

46:16.258 --> 46:18.488
I just said that we hung together.

46:18.538 --> 46:20.768
You know what the
piss-taking bastards are like.

46:20.818 --> 46:22.928
- They're doing my nut in.
- Ignore them.

46:22.978 --> 46:26.008
You haven't said anything happened
other than what actually happened?

46:26.058 --> 46:31.368
I haven't said anything. We just
chilled in Newport and London.

46:31.418 --> 46:32.608
Wasn't a secret was it?

46:32.658 --> 46:34.618
No, it wasn't a secret.

46:36.698 --> 46:38.528
Drink some water.

46:38.578 --> 46:39.648
Why?

46:39.698 --> 46:41.848
The journey. Heat and that.
You might be a little...

46:41.898 --> 46:44.488
I'm quite capable of knowing
when to drink water, thanks.

46:44.538 --> 46:47.519
Molls... I'm not stupid.

46:47.938 --> 46:50.288
I told you I know you don't want to
go out with anyone in the platoon.

46:50.338 --> 46:52.848
No, Smurf, no. I don't
want to go out with you.

46:52.898 --> 46:55.088
You're my mate, that is it!

46:55.138 --> 46:57.728
Why can't you just be my mate?

46:57.778 --> 46:59.258
Because I love you.

47:23.858 --> 47:25.528
We just hung out. It was nothing.

47:25.578 --> 47:27.138
What you telling me for?

47:29.338 --> 47:31.128
When are we off to Bastion, sir?

47:31.178 --> 47:34.928
0600 Tomorrow. You should probably pack.

47:34.978 --> 47:37.208
What, so this is the end, yeah?

50:44.578 --> 50:46.968
The kids are going to school.

50:47.018 --> 50:49.808
Try not to run the little bleeders
over or it'll all have been

50:49.858 --> 50:51.328
a bit of a waste of time!

50:51.378 --> 50:53.208
Our work here is done.

50:55.858 --> 50:58.768
So, are we at Camp Bastion
till draw down, Sir?

50:58.818 --> 51:00.368
Until we are told otherwise.

51:00.418 --> 51:01.848
Sweet!

51:01.898 --> 51:03.858
Sir, there's only boys!

51:04.898 --> 51:07.808
There's only boys going to school, Sir.

51:07.858 --> 51:10.088
We've been called back to Bastion, Dawes.

51:10.138 --> 51:12.408
The ANA are in control of the area.

51:12.458 --> 51:14.218
It has nothing to do with us.

51:16.138 --> 51:17.888
Are we nearly there yet or what?

51:20.058 --> 51:21.298
Chill!

51:25.378 --> 51:28.408
* The wheels on the bus go
round and round, round and round *

51:28.458 --> 51:29.928
* Round and round *

51:29.978 --> 51:34.608
* The wheels on the bus go
round and round all day long *

51:34.658 --> 51:37.408
* The gun on the bus goes bang bang bang *

51:37.458 --> 51:40.008
* Bang bang bang, bang bang bang *

51:40.058 --> 51:43.538
* The guns on the bus go bang bang bang. *

51:45.018 --> 51:47.458
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

51:54.418 --> 51:56.088
Sheet pinned down by rocks.

51:56.138 --> 51:58.048
Looks like there could
be a body underneath.

51:58.098 --> 52:01.168
Blood all over the sheet,
Sir. Probably booby trapped.

52:01.218 --> 52:03.138
I'm ready, Boss.

52:06.218 --> 52:08.528
I want you guys out and covering.

52:08.578 --> 52:10.248
Dawes, you come with me.

52:11.978 --> 52:13.938
Need you on that gun, Smurf.

52:24.138 --> 52:26.368
It moved! It fucking moved.

52:26.418 --> 52:29.128
I swear, Sir. Did anyone else see that?

52:29.178 --> 52:31.258
Are you sure it wasn't just the wind?

52:34.138 --> 52:36.608
I'll investigate.

52:36.658 --> 52:38.658
You wait out until I call you in.

53:01.898 --> 53:04.488
Dawes, what the hell are you doing?

53:04.538 --> 53:06.018
Molly?

53:09.578 --> 53:11.048
You got a death wish?

53:11.098 --> 53:12.498
Maybe.

53:21.058 --> 53:23.448
Anyway, it's good to have
some quality time together.

53:23.498 --> 53:25.498
Is that why you're risking your neck?

53:31.618 --> 53:33.968
Nothing happened with Smurf.

53:34.018 --> 53:35.848
But at least now I know.

53:35.898 --> 53:38.128
Know what?

53:38.214 --> 53:40.604
Well, I never thought you
would look at someone like me.

53:40.654 --> 53:42.934
I thought that you were out of my league.

53:43.974 --> 53:45.894
What are you trying to say, Dawes?

53:46.934 --> 53:48.614
I'm just saying...

53:51.614 --> 53:53.804
I'm fond of you, Sir.

53:53.854 --> 53:56.204
And I wanted to tell you
in case we get to that sheet

53:56.254 --> 53:59.844
and someone detonates it and
we're blown to smithereens.

53:59.894 --> 54:01.724
Well, let's continue this conversation

54:01.774 --> 54:03.524
when we're back at Brize Norton, shall we?

54:03.574 --> 54:05.964
You mean that love's stronger
than army regulations?

54:06.014 --> 54:07.974
Nothing is stronger than army regulations.

54:18.534 --> 54:20.454
Do you love me?

54:37.414 --> 54:40.124
Sohail. Sohail?

54:40.174 --> 54:42.324
Vallon the perimeter.

54:42.374 --> 54:44.804
Sohail, just stay with me, all right?

54:44.854 --> 54:48.124
I'm going to need you to give
me them evil eyes again, OK?

54:48.309 --> 54:50.619
Kinders, it's Sohail! Wait out.

54:50.669 --> 54:54.059
We going to need to cas
evac him out of here ASAP.

54:54.109 --> 54:56.899
Kinders, make sure they send
in the mert. Cat A injured ANA.

54:56.949 --> 54:59.979
Roger that.

55:00.629 --> 55:02.019
Let me die.

55:02.069 --> 55:03.579
Tell them to let me die.

55:03.629 --> 55:05.339
Just keep your head still for me, OK?

55:07.589 --> 55:09.099
He says he has nothing to live for.

55:09.149 --> 55:10.819
We've all got to have hope, mate.

55:10.869 --> 55:13.939
I'm a West Ham fan, believe me,
I know what I'm talking about.

55:13.989 --> 55:15.939
Who did this to you, Sohail?

55:15.989 --> 55:17.589
Taliban.

55:21.149 --> 55:23.939
They ask me to do something.

55:23.989 --> 55:27.349
They beat me up because I say, "No".

55:38.669 --> 55:40.459
Is he going to make it?

55:40.509 --> 55:42.099
Massive internal bleeds.

55:42.149 --> 55:44.629
We'll operate and try to
alleviate some pressure but...

55:52.389 --> 55:53.909
How you doing, mate?

55:59.509 --> 56:00.989
Well, hang in there for us, yeah?

56:02.989 --> 56:05.469
They kidnap me and beat me up.

56:06.629 --> 56:09.149
Anything to do with the green
on green at the mountain pass?

56:11.229 --> 56:12.509
No.

56:13.659 --> 56:16.009
Was it something to do with Bashira?

56:16.059 --> 56:20.979
Her father, Badrai, sent her to spy.

56:24.499 --> 56:27.819
That's why I tried to keep her away.

56:31.619 --> 56:35.729
He said I had to say where she is.

56:35.779 --> 56:37.329
You didn't tell him did you?

56:37.379 --> 56:39.929
He mustn't know where she is.

56:39.979 --> 56:42.019
I don't know where she is.

56:43.939 --> 56:45.699
So they beat you with rocks?

56:47.379 --> 56:50.379
They beat me with rocks because

56:51.459 --> 56:52.979
I wouldn't kill someone.

56:54.619 --> 56:56.299
Kill who, Sohail?

57:15.179 --> 57:17.779
He's gone off. He's gone off!

57:20.299 --> 57:22.339
OK, his last GCS was 8.

57:24.859 --> 57:26.329
He's suddenly dropped his GCS.

57:26.379 --> 57:28.350
His blood pressure is going
up and his pulse is dropping.

57:28.351 --> 57:31.809
- OK.
- No radial pulse.

57:31.859 --> 57:34.939
Let's get him into the
scanner. Call an anaesthetist.

58:05.939 --> 58:08.809
You're going to be all right.
I'm going to get you out of there.

58:08.859 --> 58:10.249
I just need you to stay with me, OK?

58:10.299 --> 58:14.369
The insurgent known to us as
Badrai is on his way to Kabul with

58:14.419 --> 58:16.569
a cache of explosives.

58:16.619 --> 58:18.889
This mission will determine
how successful our time

58:18.939 --> 58:20.249
in Afghanistan has been.

58:20.299 --> 58:21.939
It's not Badrai.

58:23.019 --> 58:25.569
- Bashira.
- She's safe.

58:25.619 --> 58:27.209
Not anymore.

58:27.259 --> 58:30.089
Man down! Man down!

58:30.139 --> 58:32.689
I want you to be the last thing I see.

58:32.739 --> 58:33.979
Ditto.
