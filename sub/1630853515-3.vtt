(chuckles)
What's the difference?

05:07.098 --> 05:09.350
Well, it's about going
back to the roots.

05:09.434 --> 05:12.145
All great novelists
in the 19th century
were serialized.

05:12.228 --> 05:13.730
I hear you,
but to everyone else,

05:13.813 --> 05:16.691
it's still a TV series
based on a silent serial.

05:16.774 --> 05:18.609
Yeah, but series have history.

05:18.693 --> 05:20.361
They didn't just pop
out of nowhere.

05:20.445 --> 05:22.113
Serials became novels.

05:22.196 --> 05:24.115
They could be seen
as long movies.

05:24.198 --> 05:26.200
-Edmond: Hi, Mira.
-Zoe: No, they're
not long movies.

05:26.284 --> 05:31.080

05:32.707 --> 05:35.710
A beer is fine. Thanks.

05:36.669 --> 05:38.796
Well, early cinema was content.

05:38.880 --> 05:41.466
No, absolutely not.
It was the opposite of content.

05:41.549 --> 05:43.551
They had no idea
what they were doing.

05:43.634 --> 05:44.677
They were inventing the medium

05:44.761 --> 05:47.430
and went where their
imagination took them.

05:47.513 --> 05:50.349
Regina:
Mm, I beg to differ.

05:50.433 --> 05:51.893
They invented the projector,

05:51.976 --> 05:54.437
got the audience interested,
and... they had to generate

05:54.520 --> 05:56.064
content to keep people hooked.

05:56.147 --> 05:58.691
What are your issues
with series?

06:00.568 --> 06:01.861
Because you have platforms.

06:01.944 --> 06:04.405
They need content,
so you stretch the content.

06:04.489 --> 06:06.949
You adapt to the market.
That's the opposite of art.

06:07.033 --> 06:09.911
I grew up on re-runs
of "Dallas."

06:09.994 --> 06:13.748
I heard Rainer Werner Fassbinder
was a fan, too.

06:13.831 --> 06:15.750
I used to jerk off to Sue Ellen.

06:15.833 --> 06:18.961
-Sue Ellen, really?
-Gottfried: She was so hot.

06:19.045 --> 06:21.672
But I would've loved
to fuck Bobby Ewing, too.

06:21.756 --> 06:24.592
(chuckles)
Thank you, Gottfried,
for sharing that with us.

06:24.675 --> 06:27.762
You make a TV show...
you're a slave to the ratings.

06:27.845 --> 06:29.639
-It's simple.
-Yeah, I agree.

06:29.722 --> 06:32.141
N-Now the industry is too aware

06:32.225 --> 06:33.851
of what their audience wants.

06:33.935 --> 06:35.603
-Too much marketing.
-Exactly.

06:35.686 --> 06:37.146
That's not what art
should be about.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.273
Who cares if cinema is art?

06:39.357 --> 06:41.359

06:46.531 --> 06:49.700

11:08.125 --> 11:10.586
uh, the Renault-Duval bank.

-Yeah.

11:23.766 --> 11:25.893
No, because it looked
like you were out of it.

11:25.976 --> 11:28.604
No, no, no. I-I, I was
just telling them I had

11:28.687 --> 11:30.231
an amazing night's sleep,

11:30.314 --> 11:32.900
and now I'm... ready.

11:32.983 --> 11:34.527
-Okay, good.
-And I'm focused.

11:34.610 --> 11:35.861
No, because for a second,

11:35.945 --> 11:38.781
it looked like you were
passing out, so, um.

11:39.615 --> 11:42.243
Anyway, okay. Um, so.

11:42.326 --> 11:45.246
The Vampires got the intel

11:45.329 --> 11:49.542
that, um, the bank is
about to make a major

11:49.625 --> 11:51.293
cash transfer to Rouen.

11:51.377 --> 11:55.589
-A-Any idea where, uh, Rouen is?
-Uh...

11:55.673 --> 11:58.801
-S-Should I, should I know?
-No, no, no, not at all.

11:58.884 --> 12:01.637
-Okay, yeah, I don't.
-Maybe the only thing
you have to know is that,

12:01.721 --> 12:04.140
uh, it's two hours
from Paris by train.

12:04.223 --> 12:06.684
-Two hours. Pretty--
-Yeah, wh-whatever it is.

12:06.767 --> 12:11.355
So... a clerk named Métadier
will be the courier.

12:11.439 --> 12:14.191
It's, um, this guy, uh...

13:11.832 --> 13:14.210

-Yes.

13:30.309 --> 13:32.561

13:32.645 --> 13:35.356
want to get rid of Métadier.

13:35.439 --> 13:39.193
Can you, can you just,

The director is over there.

30:32.455 --> 30:33.540
Thanks.

30:35.917 --> 30:37.252
Hi, Gunnar.

30:44.259 --> 30:46.386
(chatter on radio)

30:55.228 --> 30:57.981
(ethereal music plays)

31:06.656 --> 31:09.325
-Director: Cut, cut!
-Whoa! All right, gotcha.

31:09.409 --> 31:10.493
-(laughing)
-Got him.

31:10.577 --> 31:13.788
-Okay, got him.
-(alarm sounding)

31:15.039 --> 31:17.542
I thought I was
gonna shit myself.

31:17.625 --> 31:18.835
That would not have been pretty.

31:18.918 --> 31:20.670
-Can I get some water?
-Absolutely.

31:20.753 --> 31:21.921
-Gunnar: Eamonn.
-Yeah?

31:22.005 --> 31:23.214
-Gunnar: That was great.
-Yeah?

31:23.298 --> 31:24.132
I love the spinning.

31:24.215 --> 31:25.550
-Mm-hm.
-Mm. You really felt

31:25.633 --> 31:27.176
like you were falling
in the, the abyss.

31:27.260 --> 31:28.928
-It felt good, it felt good.
-Yeah?

31:29.012 --> 31:30.722
I wish we had
a camera in the helmet.

31:30.805 --> 31:31.973
'Cause I, I, I thought
I was, like,

31:32.056 --> 31:34.309
-I was gonna cry on that one.
-Yeah.

31:44.777 --> 31:46.321
-Hi.
-Mira: Hey.

31:48.281 --> 31:50.325
-That was impressive.
-Thank you.

31:53.036 --> 31:54.746
So how long have you been here?

31:54.829 --> 31:56.873
Six weeks, ten more to go.

31:56.956 --> 31:59.667
Sorry I didn't call sooner.

31:59.751 --> 32:02.045
It's not the easiest
call to make.

32:04.213 --> 32:05.298
I know.

32:06.758 --> 32:09.260
(exhales) So, um...

32:09.344 --> 32:11.763
-what's the film?
-(both chuckling)

32:11.846 --> 32:15.183
They are pitching it
as "Blade Runner"...

32:15.266 --> 32:18.561
-(chuckling)
-...um, but without
the neo-noir elements

32:18.645 --> 32:21.105
or the replicants,
or... the rain.

32:21.189 --> 32:22.732
Why none of that?

32:22.815 --> 32:24.484
They did market research,
and audiences

32:24.567 --> 32:26.152
find rain really depressing.

32:26.235 --> 32:27.779
-Mm-hm.
-And there's no recognition
for replicants...

32:27.862 --> 32:30.114
-Aw.
-...and I think they
had a hard time

32:30.198 --> 32:31.616
with the concept of neo-noir.

32:31.699 --> 32:33.076
Actually, I think
they had a hard time

32:33.159 --> 32:34.702
with the concept of noir
in the first place.

32:34.786 --> 32:37.246
Then... I mean, what's left?

32:37.330 --> 32:38.206
Gunnar.

32:38.289 --> 32:39.666
-Gunnar is left?
-Yeah.

32:39.749 --> 32:42.001
No, he's a good director.
I think he'll make it cool.

32:42.085 --> 32:44.212
I trust him not to
compromise his vision.

32:44.295 --> 32:45.296
Mm. Seems he already has.

32:45.380 --> 32:47.548
You're such--

32:47.632 --> 32:49.258
You never liked him, did you?

32:49.342 --> 32:52.595
I mean, he's nice... No.

32:52.679 --> 32:54.931
-We used to argue about it.
-We did.

32:55.014 --> 32:57.934
Well, it's the first time
I've heard he has a “vision.”

33:01.813 --> 33:05.233
So... so, are we having a drink?

33:05.316 --> 33:08.194
They have a little
petite cafeteria.

33:08.277 --> 33:09.737
I'd rather not take chances.

33:09.821 --> 33:14.075
I don't want a photo
of us to pop up on TMZ
or wherever the fuck.

33:15.326 --> 33:16.244
Okay.

33:17.412 --> 33:18.830
My trailer?

33:21.457 --> 33:24.711
S-So, h-how are you doin'?

33:24.794 --> 33:26.838
Homesick.

33:26.921 --> 33:30.174
-But life is treating you well?
-It is.

33:30.258 --> 33:31.718
I have a new girlfriend.

33:31.801 --> 33:34.053
I think maybe I love her.

33:36.305 --> 33:37.557
Great.

33:37.640 --> 33:40.017
She's a singer.
Actually, can you just

33:40.101 --> 33:43.187
-get this. It's just a zip.
-Of course.

33:46.649 --> 33:47.900
Merci.

33:47.984 --> 33:49.318
She's on tour at the moment,

33:49.402 --> 33:52.822
but, um... I don't really
get to see her that much.

33:52.905 --> 33:54.198
I know.

33:54.824 --> 33:55.908
Lianna.

33:55.992 --> 33:58.745
-I like her new stuff.
-It's amazing, isn't it?

33:58.828 --> 34:00.163
I think I'm, like,
her biggest fan.

34:00.246 --> 34:02.832
Yeah, the last, um,
album was really cool.

34:02.915 --> 34:06.294
Daring... career move.

34:06.377 --> 34:08.045
But she really pulls it off.

34:08.129 --> 34:09.756
She's so smart.

34:09.839 --> 34:12.717
Um, do you want milk and sugar?

34:13.885 --> 34:15.386
Don't you remember?

34:17.889 --> 34:19.265
Milk, no sugar.

34:19.766 --> 34:20.850
Yeah.

34:22.560 --> 34:25.855
I read about you and Laurie.

34:25.938 --> 34:29.233
-Oh, yeah.
-I'm sorry.

34:29.317 --> 34:31.319
You can't be completely sorry.

34:31.402 --> 34:32.945
Why do you say that?

34:33.029 --> 34:36.032
Because you and I
broke up because of her.

34:36.908 --> 34:38.576
I think I'm over it.

34:38.659 --> 34:42.413
Hm, you're more
resilient than I thought.

34:42.497 --> 34:45.458
Yeah, which is not
to say that I wasn't...

34:45.541 --> 34:46.959
devastated at first.

34:47.043 --> 34:48.920
Don't think it was easy on me.

34:49.003 --> 34:50.838
I don't think it
was easy on you, but...

34:52.006 --> 34:53.925
I didn't see it coming.

34:54.008 --> 34:56.260
So, I had to find
something to move on to.

34:58.930 --> 35:00.515
And have you found it?

35:01.808 --> 35:02.934
I may have.

35:05.728 --> 35:07.105
What do you mean?

35:09.315 --> 35:10.858
Lianna is pregnant.

35:14.070 --> 35:15.655
-I mean--
-Congratulations.

35:15.738 --> 35:16.989
She's, she's-- It's--

35:17.073 --> 35:18.950
You're not supposed
to tell anyone until 12 weeks,

35:19.033 --> 35:21.619
and she's only 10 weeks, but...

35:21.702 --> 35:24.664
-Boy or girl?
-I think it's a girl.

35:24.747 --> 35:27.917
Then, double congrats.

35:29.961 --> 35:31.045
Wow.

35:31.754 --> 35:33.798
Yeah, I...

35:33.881 --> 35:37.552
I thought you hated
the idea of having kids.

35:37.635 --> 35:42.723
At least... that's what
you told me, right?

35:42.807 --> 35:44.559
Yeah, I, um...

35:45.726 --> 35:47.228
I think I used
to think like that.

35:47.311 --> 35:49.856
-Not anymore.
-No.

35:49.939 --> 35:51.691
I guess I'm a different person.

35:53.067 --> 35:54.360
So am I.

35:56.654 --> 35:59.866
We're not complete
strangers... yet.

36:02.577 --> 36:04.537
But we've drifted apart.

36:05.246 --> 36:06.539
(chuckles)

36:07.874 --> 36:11.002
-I envy you, though.
-What do you envy?

36:11.085 --> 36:12.753
It-- Okay.

36:12.837 --> 36:16.257
Do you remember that we
used to always talk about
the movies of René Vidal?

36:16.340 --> 36:18.968
Aw, yeah.

36:19.051 --> 36:21.637
-We were fans. (laughs)
-Yeah, I know! And--

36:21.721 --> 36:22.847
-How--
-Yeah.

36:22.930 --> 36:24.140
Who would've thought
that you would end up

36:24.223 --> 36:26.767
-working with him?
-Who would've thought?

36:26.851 --> 36:28.185
-(laughs)
-Thanks.

36:28.269 --> 36:33.232
Um, well, yeah, his, uh,
process can be confusing.

36:33.316 --> 36:36.235
-I bet. What's wrong with that?
-Ugh, I don't know.

36:37.320 --> 36:38.654
Maybe it's just me.

36:38.738 --> 36:43.117
You know me,
I'm... easily confused.

36:43.201 --> 36:46.746
I feel a bit lost. Ah.

36:48.748 --> 36:52.293
-Where... did you get these?
-What? Don't.

36:52.376 --> 36:54.962
-Did you ship those?
-My assistant is addicted.

36:55.046 --> 36:58.049
-They're disgusting.
Take all of them.
-I love her.

36:58.132 --> 37:00.301
But seriously...

37:00.384 --> 37:02.136
don't worry about it.

37:02.219 --> 37:04.013
You're a stranger
in a strange town

37:04.096 --> 37:05.806
dealing with
a strange character.

37:05.890 --> 37:08.643
It's supposed to be confusing.

37:08.726 --> 37:12.230
You were always
good at helping me
with my insecurities.

37:15.149 --> 37:17.234
Whoa! (laughs)

37:18.486 --> 37:20.029
Is that why you miss me?

37:22.198 --> 37:24.325
These days, I...

37:25.868 --> 37:28.037
I feel unfocused...

37:30.706 --> 37:31.624
and lonely.

37:31.707 --> 37:33.584
Well, maybe that's
part of your quest.

37:33.668 --> 37:38.631
-What quest?
-Your quest for your true self.

37:38.714 --> 37:41.759
-I don't even know
why I'm doing this.
-Yes, you do.

37:41.842 --> 37:43.886
You're doing it
because you're good at it.

37:45.721 --> 37:48.015
You're doing something
that you love.

37:48.099 --> 37:49.392
It's a privilege.

37:51.435 --> 37:53.771
-I know.
-You shouldn't complain.

37:56.065 --> 37:57.400
I shouldn't.

38:09.537 --> 38:11.497
I miss you.

38:15.042 --> 38:16.210
I miss you, too.

38:16.293 --> 38:17.962
We fucked up.

38:18.045 --> 38:19.797
Yeah, we sure did.

38:20.756 --> 38:23.175
And now there's no way back.

38:24.468 --> 38:25.761
Nope.

38:26.971 --> 38:28.222
No way.

share your ride.
Is that okay?

40:48.529 --> 40:50.322

-No! Zoe's a nutcase.

41:05.880 --> 41:09.049
She's fun, you know?
It's nothing serious.

41:09.133 --> 41:12.011
-Sex is very serious.
-Sex?

41:12.094 --> 41:15.764
No, we just, you know...
flirt a bit.

41:15.848 --> 41:17.266
What about Regina?

41:17.349 --> 41:19.059
Not Regina.

41:19.143 --> 41:21.520
-Of course, Regina.

She's a-- She's no bullshit.
She's a good kid.

41:26.025 --> 41:29.695
-You'll see. Soon enough,
she's bound to make her move.
-Ah, come on.

41:29.778 --> 41:32.156
I'm young, I'm a movie star.

41:32.239 --> 41:37.536
I have to deal
with that kind of stuff
all the time, you know?

41:37.620 --> 41:40.539
Uh, what matters is
just staying sane,

41:40.623 --> 41:42.124
and not letting it affect me.

41:42.208 --> 41:47.004
It affected me, and I enjoyed
having it affect me.

41:47.087 --> 41:49.840
When I was younger,
I fucked anything that moved.

41:49.924 --> 41:52.593
Gottfried, that's
common knowledge.

41:52.676 --> 41:55.304
Aw... you never
hit on me, though.

41:55.387 --> 41:58.265
-Do you want me to?
-No! (laughs)

41:58.349 --> 42:00.351
Stay away, fuck's sake.

42:00.434 --> 42:01.769
Yeah, sorry. Sorry, Mira,

42:01.852 --> 42:05.814
-but... you're boring to me.
-Oh, thank god. Thank god.

42:05.898 --> 42:07.983
-I eased up on a lot of things.
-Good for you.

42:08.067 --> 42:11.362
Well... I don't want
to end up like my friend
Harvey Weinstein.

42:11.445 --> 42:13.697
Oh, I'm sure, yeah. (chuckles)

42:16.408 --> 42:18.327
Look what I found.

42:18.410 --> 42:21.288
It's an interview
from the late '40s
with Musidora...

42:21.372 --> 42:22.915
the original Irma Vep.

42:24.375 --> 42:26.585
(video plays)

42:26.669 --> 42:29.296
-How old was she?
-Well, it was in 1947,

42:29.380 --> 42:32.841
so she must've been
in her late 50s, I think.

42:35.177 --> 42:37.304
(speaking French)

(video continues)

43:32.484 --> 43:35.154
(Gottfried chuckles)

43:35.237 --> 43:36.947
So sad she aged so badly.

43:37.031 --> 43:41.160
How can you say such bullshit?
She's a beautiful woman.

43:41.243 --> 43:43.787
(laughs)
Not from my perspective.

43:43.871 --> 43:46.957
-Just shut up, Gottfried.
-I'm just stating the obvious.

43:47.041 --> 43:48.125
I'm honestly pained.

43:48.208 --> 43:50.210
She was such a sexy
woman in her heyday.

43:50.294 --> 43:52.463
-Can someone just please--
-She was, she was such a sexy...

43:52.546 --> 43:54.840
-throw this guy out of the car?
-...woman in her heyday.

43:54.923 --> 43:57.885
