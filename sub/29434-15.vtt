WEBVTT

00:04.370 --> 00:05.721
What's the verdict,
Rach?

00:05.765 --> 00:08.336
The probability of a train
derailing is too high.

00:08.379 --> 00:09.905
1 in 432,000.

00:09.947 --> 00:11.603
Well, that's
not so bad.

00:11.647 --> 00:13.433
Better than the chances
of a car crash.How is that relevant?

00:13.476 --> 00:16.919
We've already established
we're not driving.

00:16.962 --> 00:18.487
You know the agreement,
three months to research

00:18.531 --> 00:19.968
how we're traveling to Arizona,

00:20.012 --> 00:22.017
not a day longer.
We decide today.

00:22.059 --> 00:24.281
There has to be some safer way.

00:24.324 --> 00:26.155
The rehearsal dinner's
in a week.

00:26.199 --> 00:28.028
I just want to make sure
we actually attend

00:28.072 --> 00:30.120
Aunt Sheila's wedding,
not die on the way.

00:30.163 --> 00:32.603
Why don't we take a bus?

00:32.647 --> 00:35.260
Huh? It's cheap,
it's safe,

00:35.305 --> 00:37.918
and you can let all this go
and focus on having fun.

00:37.962 --> 00:39.573
Most busses don't even
have seatbelts.

00:39.617 --> 00:41.055
N-N-No way.

00:41.098 --> 00:43.102
Okay, sweetheart.

00:44.889 --> 00:46.066
Take a deep breath.

00:48.287 --> 00:50.597
You take your meds this morning?

00:52.122 --> 00:54.083
I need you to focus
on one thing.

00:54.126 --> 00:56.435
You know what that is?

00:56.478 --> 00:58.265
You're going to say breakfast.

01:00.269 --> 01:02.186
Bingo.

01:02.229 --> 01:03.318
[screams]

01:03.362 --> 01:05.453
Dad, wh-what's
happening?
[gunshots]

01:05.497 --> 01:07.762
Upstairs, Rach, use the
fire ladder like we practiced.

01:07.806 --> 01:10.377
Upstairs! Go!

01:17.391 --> 01:19.395
Find the girl.

01:21.965 --> 01:24.361
♪ Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:24.406 --> 01:27.151
♪ Bang, bang, bang, bang

01:27.194 --> 01:29.459
♪ Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:29.503 --> 01:30.766
♪ How, how, how, how

01:30.809 --> 01:33.032
♪ Hey, hey

01:39.175 --> 01:40.394
♪ You gotta come on.

01:42.966 --> 01:44.926
What do you
think, Mama?

01:44.970 --> 01:47.627
Oh...

01:47.671 --> 01:49.587
Same Trutone
you remember?

01:49.632 --> 01:51.984
It's like I stepped
back in time.

01:52.027 --> 01:54.555
I-I can't believe
you own this bar now.

01:54.598 --> 01:56.515
Yeah. It's a lot of work,
but I love it.

01:56.559 --> 01:58.650
Glad you made it.
[chuckles]
Yeah.

01:58.693 --> 02:01.090
Expected y'all
a couple hours ago.

02:01.133 --> 02:03.181
Uh, Mena had
a rough morning,

02:03.225 --> 02:06.056
so we had a late start
leaving the motel in Montgomery.

02:06.100 --> 02:07.930
Well, it's a long trip
from Virginia to New Orleans.

02:07.973 --> 02:10.413
Yeah.
Seems like she's
doing okay now.

02:10.457 --> 02:12.418
RITA: Let's just hope
it lasts long enough

02:12.460 --> 02:14.248
for her to have that tour
at Vista Shores.

02:14.291 --> 02:16.992
How's she feel about
maybe moving back?

02:17.036 --> 02:19.346
The jury's s-still out
on that one.

02:19.388 --> 02:20.783
PRIDE: Jimmy,
want you to meet

02:20.826 --> 02:24.486
my mother, Mena Cantrell. Mama,

02:24.530 --> 02:26.273
this is Jimmy Boyd,
the new bar manager.

02:26.315 --> 02:27.579
Hi.
Well, I see
you got your looks

02:27.623 --> 02:29.757
from Mena's side
of the family, Dwayne.

02:29.801 --> 02:31.238
[laughter]

02:31.283 --> 02:33.461
You miss our
chicory coffee?

02:33.504 --> 02:34.899
Just made
a fresh pot.

02:34.941 --> 02:36.946
Figured you could use it
after that long drive.

02:36.990 --> 02:39.300
Cassius doesn't like me
to drink coffee,

02:39.343 --> 02:41.172
thinks it makes me
too jittery.

02:44.875 --> 02:49.145
The doctors said that her memory
would continue to come and go.

02:49.189 --> 02:52.369
PRIDE: Just hope
being back actually helps.

02:55.245 --> 02:56.813
She likes you, Jimmy.

02:56.857 --> 03:01.562
We should tell her you're
more than the bar manager.

03:01.607 --> 03:02.695
Well, I appreciate that,

03:02.739 --> 03:05.484
but she got a lot
to take in right now.

03:05.528 --> 03:07.313
Letting her know
that Cassius was my daddy, too,

03:07.357 --> 03:08.838
well, that can wait a while.

03:08.882 --> 03:10.974
Lot of memories
for her here,

03:11.016 --> 03:12.005
not all of them good.

03:12.042 --> 03:13.569
RITA: Hey, if it's
too hard for her,

03:13.613 --> 03:16.407
we'll just turn around
and drive her back.

03:16.452 --> 03:19.332
Whatever's best for your mom,
that's what we'll do.Yeah, okay.

03:21.733 --> 03:24.353
I always loved you
in that dress.

03:24.397 --> 03:25.619
Yeah.

03:25.662 --> 03:28.588
You know, when you
were a little boy,

03:28.630 --> 03:31.251
you used to sneak in
and watch me sing,

03:31.294 --> 03:33.172
right over there.Right there, I know,

03:33.215 --> 03:36.272
on a stool,
hiding. [chuckles]

03:39.326 --> 03:41.291
Loved the way
you lit up the stage.

03:41.335 --> 03:44.260
Good to have you back

03:44.304 --> 03:48.233
where you belong, Mama.

03:51.550 --> 03:52.903
But your dad was
a three-star admiral,

03:52.947 --> 03:54.737
why didn't you just go
to the Naval Academy?

03:54.781 --> 03:56.615
Is there something wrong
with being a Marine grunt?

03:56.658 --> 03:58.666
No, no, no, I have nothing
but respect for enlistees.

03:58.710 --> 04:00.500
I'm just pointing out
that you had options.

04:00.545 --> 04:01.853
Oh, you found me out,
Agent Khoury.

04:01.897 --> 04:03.382
I'm a chronic
underachiever.

04:03.425 --> 04:05.564
Hey, so the victim's a Seabee
out of Belle Chasse

04:05.608 --> 04:07.354
named Ben Kinnaman.

04:07.398 --> 04:08.402
Yeah, we heard
he's still alive.

04:08.446 --> 04:09.755
Barely.
Neighbor saw

04:09.798 --> 04:11.327
two masked men leave the house,

04:11.371 --> 04:14.557
called 911. They rushed in
to take him to the hospital.

04:14.602 --> 04:16.435
You think it was a robbery?

04:16.478 --> 04:18.879
I don't know. He was shot
twice in the chest.

04:18.922 --> 04:20.801
Neighbors didn't hear
any gunshots,

04:20.844 --> 04:22.634
so we're thinking
it was a silenced weapon.

04:22.677 --> 04:24.642
Yeah, sounds like
a professional hit.

04:24.685 --> 04:25.820
You don't say?

04:25.864 --> 04:28.046
Oh, aren't we just
so lucky to have

04:28.091 --> 04:29.575
such a brilliant agent
on our team now?

04:31.146 --> 04:32.195
So lucky.

04:35.905 --> 04:38.742
Shooters weren't going
for subtlety.

04:38.787 --> 04:40.621
Kicked in the door, came in hot.

04:40.663 --> 04:43.109
Seabee Kinnaman was trying to
defend himself, but looks like

04:43.152 --> 04:44.199
he didn't get a round off.

04:44.244 --> 04:45.510
Anything in his
file indicate

04:45.554 --> 04:47.124
why he might be targeted?Nothing so far.

04:47.168 --> 04:50.050
Sebastian's talking to his CO,
but Kinnaman mostly worked

04:50.093 --> 04:52.015
on facility upgrades
at Belle Chasse.

04:52.057 --> 04:55.070
Why put out a professional hit
on a naval engineer?

04:55.114 --> 04:56.642
Hey, Kinnaman
has a daughter, right?

04:56.686 --> 04:57.994
Teenage girl.

04:58.039 --> 04:59.479
Where is she?

04:59.523 --> 05:00.964
Cop told us he was
calling the school

05:01.007 --> 05:02.753
while they sent a unit
over there. Why?

05:02.798 --> 05:05.504
I think she was here. In fact,
I think this all started here.

05:05.548 --> 05:08.735
Shots fired from outside.

05:08.778 --> 05:10.743
Someone tried to take Kinnaman
out from a distance.

05:10.787 --> 05:12.707
Looks like breakfast
for two.

05:12.752 --> 05:14.760
Well, when Covington PD
cleared the house,

05:14.803 --> 05:16.593
there was no sign
of the daughter.BREAUX: Rachel!

05:17.902 --> 05:19.605
Rachel?
Hey, buddy, slow down.

05:19.649 --> 05:22.618
Tim Breaux, Covington Police.
Ben's a friend.

05:22.661 --> 05:24.189
I just heard what happened.
Is Rachel okay?

05:24.232 --> 05:25.760
Rachel is
Ben's daughter?

05:25.804 --> 05:27.682
Cop I talked to
said she was at school.

05:27.725 --> 05:29.515
She's not.
Rachel is homeschooled.

05:29.558 --> 05:31.742
She should be here.Where's her room?

05:31.785 --> 05:33.400
Upstairs.
Okay, go

05:33.444 --> 05:34.972
with Agent Gregorio, maybe she's
just hiding. Check down there.

05:35.016 --> 05:38.246
I'll coordinate a search
of the surrounding area.

05:39.775 --> 05:42.524
Rachel, you here?

05:42.568 --> 05:44.009
It's Tim.

05:44.052 --> 05:45.974
You can come out.

05:46.016 --> 05:48.025
[sighs]

05:49.423 --> 05:51.561
Did Rachel have medical issues?

05:51.605 --> 05:54.530
She's on the autism spectrum,
highly intelligent.

05:54.573 --> 05:55.970
The meds are just
for anxiety.

05:56.014 --> 05:58.285
There's a fire ladder.

05:58.328 --> 05:59.463
Yeah, Ben had them installed

05:59.506 --> 06:01.165
in the bedrooms
to make Rachel feel safer.

06:01.209 --> 06:02.999
She found a way out, smart girl.

06:03.044 --> 06:04.877
Is that her bike?

06:04.920 --> 06:06.404
That's Ben's.

06:06.448 --> 06:09.067
Rachel's is blue.

06:09.111 --> 06:11.861
Where'd she go?
Does she have any family close,

06:11.906 --> 06:14.088
or friends?
No, it's just
Ben and Rachel.

06:14.131 --> 06:15.746
I don't really know
of any friends.

06:15.790 --> 06:19.938
Think, she's scared,
she's on the run. Where?

06:19.981 --> 06:22.470
Treehouse.

06:22.513 --> 06:24.521
They spent last summer
building it together.

06:24.566 --> 06:25.832
Rachel calls it
her quiet place.

06:25.875 --> 06:27.097
Is it a
bike ride away?

06:27.141 --> 06:29.105
It's on some land he owns
out in Folsom.

06:29.149 --> 06:31.637
They ride out there
all the time.All right, show me.

06:34.170 --> 06:36.134
[playing piano]

06:36.178 --> 06:38.317
I just don't know if now
is the right time

06:38.361 --> 06:40.237
to bring it up to her.

06:40.282 --> 06:42.901
Well, will there ever
be a right time?

06:42.945 --> 06:45.869
You had a breakthrough
at that clinic, Dwayne,

06:45.913 --> 06:49.231
but your mom is probably the
only person who can fill in

06:49.275 --> 06:51.719
the missing pieces so you can
put Red behind you for good.

06:51.763 --> 06:54.470
I've been sleeping great.

06:54.514 --> 06:55.910
You've also been
beating yourself up

06:55.954 --> 06:57.177
over what happened
to him.

06:57.220 --> 07:00.145
Because I told Cassius
about the affair,

07:00.189 --> 07:03.288
about Red and my mom.You were a child.

07:03.332 --> 07:06.563
What your father did to Red
isn't your fault.

07:06.606 --> 07:08.876
Just wish I knew more about him.

07:08.920 --> 07:11.190
Who his family was.

07:11.234 --> 07:15.904
I mean, what if his family never
even knew what happened to him?

07:15.949 --> 07:18.699
So go ask Mena.
Get the answers you need.

07:20.837 --> 07:23.458
She's fragile.

07:23.501 --> 07:25.422
She's also
Dwayne Pride's mother.

07:25.466 --> 07:28.303
You're a pretty tough bunch.

07:35.507 --> 07:38.301
You're just as good
on those keys as I remember.

07:38.345 --> 07:39.698
[sighs]
I just wish I could

07:39.741 --> 07:42.361
remember the words.
[chuckles]

07:45.548 --> 07:50.306
I've been thinking
about the old days,

07:50.349 --> 07:55.152
about you,
this place.

07:55.196 --> 07:58.427
Remember the man who taught me
to play the piano?

07:58.469 --> 08:00.477
Red?

08:04.406 --> 08:05.455
Clarence.

08:07.593 --> 08:10.563
Clarence. What was
his last name?

08:10.606 --> 08:13.531
Redding.

08:13.575 --> 08:18.245
Clarence Redding.
He was kind

08:18.289 --> 08:20.298
and funny.

08:22.044 --> 08:24.925
He used to make you laugh
all the time.
Yeah?

08:24.969 --> 08:29.466
I don't really remember him
all that well.

08:29.509 --> 08:31.299
Well, you liked him.

08:31.343 --> 08:32.522
You liked him a lot.

08:32.566 --> 08:35.054
He was, uh...

08:37.673 --> 08:38.852
What, Mama?

08:38.895 --> 08:42.693
He... He was...
What?

08:42.736 --> 08:45.313
[stammers] You know what,
I-I just don't think

08:45.356 --> 08:48.237
I want to talk
about this anymore.That's okay.

08:48.281 --> 08:50.375
It's okay.

08:50.402 --> 08:54.285
We don't have to talk about
anything you don't want to.

08:54.330 --> 08:56.338
[cell phone ringing]

09:00.354 --> 09:03.393
Play some more.
I like hearing it.

09:06.300 --> 09:09.633
Khoury, you, uh,

09:09.676 --> 09:11.840
got something
on our Navy engineer?

09:11.884 --> 09:13.226
Kinnaman's in surgery now.

09:13.269 --> 09:14.568
Sebastian talked to his CO,

09:14.612 --> 09:16.992
but he didn't have
any leads

09:17.036 --> 09:19.504
on why Kinnaman was targeted
in the first place.

09:19.547 --> 09:21.581
Well, we got his laptop,

09:21.624 --> 09:24.266
but it's pretty damaged.Have it sent to NCIS.

09:24.309 --> 09:25.954
I'll get Patton on it.

09:25.997 --> 09:28.204
Hey, Pride,
there's something else.

09:28.248 --> 09:32.231
Kinnaman's teenage daughter
was here during the attack.

09:32.275 --> 09:33.356
She went missing.

09:33.399 --> 09:34.352
Fled or abducted?

09:34.395 --> 09:35.737
We're hoping it's the former.

09:35.781 --> 09:37.339
Tammy and Carter
are searching for her now.

09:37.382 --> 09:39.244
PRIDE: All right,
I'll head in, coordinate

09:39.287 --> 09:40.933
social services
and St. Tammany Parish.

09:40.975 --> 09:44.093
Keep me updated.

09:44.136 --> 09:46.344
Gonna miss the tour
at Vista Shores, aren't you?

09:46.387 --> 09:48.248
I got a sailor
in critical condition

09:48.292 --> 09:49.763
and his teenage
daughter's missing.

09:49.806 --> 09:52.708
Okay, I'll, um,
call and reschedule,

09:52.750 --> 09:54.655
and, uh, we'll take care
of your mom.

09:54.699 --> 09:58.162
Maybe I'll even get her
to sing a song with me.

09:58.205 --> 09:59.331
[chuckles]

09:59.373 --> 10:01.105
She'd like that.

10:01.149 --> 10:04.656
Okay. Thanks.

10:08.248 --> 10:09.244
BREAUX:
That's Rachel's.

10:10.846 --> 10:13.054
Hey, Rachel, sweetie, it's Tim.

10:15.781 --> 10:17.642
RACHEL:
Where's my dad?

10:17.686 --> 10:19.720
He's with my team.
Why don't you come down here

10:19.763 --> 10:21.193
and chat with us
for a minute?

10:21.236 --> 10:23.141
Who's she?

10:23.183 --> 10:24.353
I'm Special Agent
Gregorio.

10:24.397 --> 10:26.170
I'm with NCIS.

10:26.214 --> 10:28.508
Naval Criminal
Investigative Service?

10:28.552 --> 10:32.015
Wow. She's one of the few who
actually knows what that means.

10:32.058 --> 10:34.266
Agent Gregorio
is very trustworthy.

10:34.309 --> 10:35.521
It's safe,
you can come on down.

10:35.564 --> 10:38.076
I don't know her.

10:38.119 --> 10:40.500
You got to be patient with her.

10:40.543 --> 10:41.799
Gain her trust.

10:43.530 --> 10:45.521
All right.

10:50.457 --> 10:52.404
My name's Tammy.

10:52.448 --> 10:54.742
And I'm a Virgo.

11:00.197 --> 11:01.972
Astrology is dumb.

11:02.015 --> 11:04.093
It's not scientific.

11:04.137 --> 11:05.998
Fair enough.

11:06.042 --> 11:08.162
Can I ask you a question?

11:08.206 --> 11:10.284
Sure.My dad says

11:10.326 --> 11:13.660
to truly know someone, you have
to know their struggles.

11:13.704 --> 11:15.565
Uh, what's
your greatest struggle?

11:15.609 --> 11:18.120
Probably my roommate's snoring.

11:18.162 --> 11:20.068
It's that bad?

11:20.111 --> 11:21.237
Rachel doesn't
really do sarcasm.

11:21.280 --> 11:23.877
Oh, right.

11:23.920 --> 11:26.648
Honestly?

11:26.691 --> 11:28.899
I guess I-I act before I think.

11:28.943 --> 11:30.717
You know?

11:30.760 --> 11:33.835
My temper can get me in trouble,
so I have to watch it.

11:33.877 --> 11:36.085
Me, too.

11:36.128 --> 11:37.123
Really?

11:42.146 --> 11:44.483
Wow, you're good.

11:44.526 --> 11:46.647
Usually it takes her
a while to warm up.

11:46.691 --> 11:48.942
I've known her and Ben
since I moved here.

11:50.804 --> 11:52.881
We got to get the people
responsible for this.

11:52.925 --> 11:53.921
We will.

11:56.994 --> 11:58.813
Hey, Rach.[gunshot]

11:59.505 --> 12:00.804
[gasps]

12:00.847 --> 12:02.752
[Rachel screaming]

12:03.488 --> 12:04.657
Come on.

12:12.925 --> 12:13.877
Come on. Move![screaming]

12:15.912 --> 12:18.077
I need you to pull it
together for me, okay?

12:20.804 --> 12:22.492
When I shoot, we run, okay?

12:22.536 --> 12:24.267
Go!

12:29.289 --> 12:30.718
[panting]

12:30.761 --> 12:32.709
Come on.

12:32.753 --> 12:34.310
Listen to me.

12:34.354 --> 12:35.782
Listen. Listen.

12:35.826 --> 12:38.813
Do what I say, and you'll
be okay, all right?

12:41.541 --> 12:42.709
Oh, okay.

12:42.752 --> 12:44.701
[shushes]
Go. Go, go. Run.

12:44.744 --> 12:46.302
Careful, it's steep.

13:02.406 --> 13:04.917
[shouting]
Oh, God...

13:05.956 --> 13:07.125
Go! We can't lose them!

13:08.338 --> 13:10.026
Where's my gun?RACHEL:
Get up!

13:10.069 --> 13:12.882
They're coming!Go.

13:12.926 --> 13:15.307
Run! Hurry!

13:17.991 --> 13:19.029
RACHEL:
You're hurt.

13:19.073 --> 13:20.286
I'm fine. I can handle it.

13:20.329 --> 13:22.233
Really. Damn it.

13:22.277 --> 13:24.484
What are you doing?I'm leaving a breadcrumb.

13:24.528 --> 13:26.433
We got to hide
until someone finds us.

13:26.476 --> 13:27.904
I know a place. This way.Whoa, whoa, whoa!

13:27.948 --> 13:30.199
Trust me.
Wait.

13:30.242 --> 13:32.017
Rachel.

13:36.260 --> 13:38.727
Hey, Sebastian, any word
from the missing girl?

13:38.770 --> 13:41.541
Uh, nothing yet. I texted
Tammy, but no response.

13:41.584 --> 13:42.883
WADE:
Those are bullets
from the shooting?

13:42.926 --> 13:45.134
Yeah. There are some
distinctive markings,

13:45.178 --> 13:47.471
so I'm running them
through NIBIN right now.

13:47.515 --> 13:50.762
I really enjoy
seeing you back here.

13:50.805 --> 13:54.571
You're an excellent field agent,
but the lab suits you.

13:54.614 --> 13:55.870
Yeah, well, at least here

13:55.914 --> 13:57.688
nobody's calling
me stupid nicknames.

13:57.731 --> 13:59.853
Hmm?

13:59.897 --> 14:01.584
It's nothing.
It's just the new guy.

14:01.628 --> 14:02.883
Ah. Agent Carter.

14:02.926 --> 14:04.529
Well, I'm looking forward
to meeting him.

14:04.572 --> 14:05.697
Yeah, well, I suggest

14:05.740 --> 14:07.775
you avoid that
for as long as possible.

14:07.818 --> 14:08.857
He's that bad?

14:08.900 --> 14:09.982
Oh, man. He's abrasive

14:10.026 --> 14:11.238
in, like, every single way.

14:11.281 --> 14:12.796
He's completely full of himself.

14:12.840 --> 14:14.658
He's wearing these fancy clothes
all the time

14:14.701 --> 14:15.956
that fit him
perfectly, you know.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.688
And he's always
calling me Slim.

14:17.732 --> 14:19.507
I don't know what that's about.
You know, I've been...

14:19.551 --> 14:20.762
been beefing up.

14:20.805 --> 14:21.931
You are still rather thin.

14:21.975 --> 14:24.484
I thought this was a safe space.

14:24.528 --> 14:28.511
Carter will simmer down.
He's just new and loud.

14:28.554 --> 14:30.979
[computer beeps]Oh, we got a hit from NIBIN.

14:31.022 --> 14:34.659
What? The gun's been
used in another crime?

14:34.701 --> 14:36.563
Yeah, a murder.

14:36.606 --> 14:37.732
Actually, five other murders.

14:37.775 --> 14:39.334
[sighs]

14:39.378 --> 14:43.793
The team needs to find
this poor girl, fast.

14:43.836 --> 14:45.308
GREGORIO:
What is this place?

14:45.351 --> 14:46.822
RACHEL: Power station,
abandoned two years ago.

14:46.866 --> 14:49.984
Eight buildings, multiple
floors, over 90 rooms.

14:50.026 --> 14:52.408
Ah. Lots of hiding places.

14:52.450 --> 14:53.446
I get it. Smart.

14:53.490 --> 14:54.876
I have an idea.

14:54.918 --> 14:57.516
We can start a fire
i-in the woods.

14:57.560 --> 14:58.945
That-that would d-draw
the killers away from us.

14:58.988 --> 15:01.023
Yeah, no. No fires.

15:01.065 --> 15:03.143
What are you,
what are you looking for?

15:03.187 --> 15:04.529
Uh, I-I can help.

15:04.572 --> 15:05.957
J-Just give me a second.

15:06.001 --> 15:07.948
Please?

15:07.992 --> 15:10.676
[exhales]

15:10.719 --> 15:13.446
Hey, I'm sorry I snapped,
I'm just a little on edge, okay?

15:13.490 --> 15:16.867
M-My dad says I talk too
much when I'm scared.

15:16.910 --> 15:19.378
A-And people don't like that,
but he says

15:19.421 --> 15:21.759
n-never apologize for being me.
[sniffles]

15:21.802 --> 15:24.270
Well, that's
really great advice.

15:24.313 --> 15:26.477
Hey, is-is he okay?

15:26.521 --> 15:28.425
We'll find out.

15:28.468 --> 15:30.243
When we get away
from these scumbags.

15:30.286 --> 15:32.711
Hey. You want to help?

15:32.754 --> 15:35.265
Yeah?
We-we need an alarm.

15:35.309 --> 15:37.862
You know what I mean?
Like, uh...

15:37.905 --> 15:40.677
So maybe, uh... broken glass
makes a lot of noise.
Oh!

15:40.720 --> 15:42.668
You know what I'm saying?Oh. I-I can break the window.

15:42.711 --> 15:44.529
And then we can lay
the glass on the floor.

15:44.572 --> 15:46.737
Yeah.
And-and then the
killers will step on it

15:46.780 --> 15:48.599
and we'll know
they're here.Well, why don't you...?

15:48.643 --> 15:50.200
Like that?

15:50.244 --> 15:52.278
Nice.

15:54.400 --> 15:57.257
Patton. You find anything
on Kinnaman's laptop?

15:57.300 --> 15:58.782
King, that's not his laptop.

15:58.825 --> 16:01.178
That's his daughter's.
And the girl got skills.

16:01.222 --> 16:03.183
She used an RSA encryption.

16:03.227 --> 16:05.580
Yeah, Rachel is no
ordinary teenager.

16:05.624 --> 16:07.062
Tell me about it.
She's some type

16:07.105 --> 16:09.242
of research genius.
Look at this.

16:09.284 --> 16:13.164
Global warming,
power plants.

16:13.207 --> 16:15.343
Hand washing?Big and small, she does it all.

16:15.386 --> 16:17.610
But I beg to differ
on her whole "most efficient

16:17.654 --> 16:20.050
hand washing ritual" results.

16:20.094 --> 16:23.581
[chuckles] Yeah, research may be
Rachel's special interest.

16:23.623 --> 16:25.062
Lot of people
with ASD have them.

16:25.106 --> 16:26.763
We got a guy in the neighborhood

16:26.806 --> 16:29.203
who drops by the bar every once
in a while. He's got autism.

16:29.246 --> 16:32.035
Makes toy race cars
to help him stay grounded.

16:32.079 --> 16:34.040
Well, lately, she's been
obsessed with the risks

16:34.084 --> 16:36.176
of different travel options.

16:36.219 --> 16:39.662
Cars, busses, trains.

16:39.706 --> 16:41.144
You name it,
she's researched it.

16:41.187 --> 16:43.280
Anything that might
make her a target?

16:43.324 --> 16:44.848
Nothing stands out.

16:44.893 --> 16:46.157
Why, you think the killers
might have been after her?

16:46.200 --> 16:47.988
I don't know what to think.

16:48.031 --> 16:51.953
So far, we haven't found
any motive for a hit at all.

16:53.304 --> 16:54.917
Keep digging.

16:54.961 --> 16:56.224
Hey.

16:56.268 --> 16:57.793
You get a
chance to talk

16:57.837 --> 16:59.319
to your mom about the guy
in your dreams?

16:59.363 --> 17:01.368
Just a little. Got a name.

17:01.410 --> 17:03.415
Clarence Redding.

17:03.459 --> 17:06.554
Red. That makes sense.
Hey, you want me

17:06.596 --> 17:08.906
to keep digging, see if I find
out anything about his family?

17:08.951 --> 17:11.173
No, no. Stay with the laptop.

17:11.218 --> 17:13.744
We're running out of time
to find Rachel Kinnaman.

17:16.316 --> 17:17.799
GREGORIO:
We got to find a place

17:17.842 --> 17:20.455
to hole up until my team
realizes I'm gone.

17:20.500 --> 17:21.982
Uh, h-how will they find us?

17:22.026 --> 17:24.249
Because they're the best.
They'll get here.

17:24.291 --> 17:28.607
W-When, when I ask a question,
you don't always answer.

17:28.650 --> 17:30.699
Y-You say something else.

17:30.743 --> 17:32.269
[sighs]

17:33.619 --> 17:35.450
Yeah, you're right.
I'm sorry about that.

17:35.493 --> 17:37.760
I'll try to
do better.

17:39.067 --> 17:40.331
Come on.

17:40.375 --> 17:41.507
[panting]

17:45.867 --> 17:47.828
Rachel.

17:47.871 --> 17:50.007
We're gonna get
out of here, baby.

17:50.051 --> 17:51.750
You don't know that.Sure, I do.

17:51.794 --> 17:53.842
Well, no, I don't, but...

17:53.886 --> 17:55.891
I'm gonna do everything I can

17:55.934 --> 17:58.287
to try to make that
happen, all right?

17:58.331 --> 17:59.944
Promise.

17:59.987 --> 18:02.646
Okay. Come on.

18:03.691 --> 18:05.522
[sniffles]

18:05.566 --> 18:07.440
Seems like they
tracked me to find you.

18:07.483 --> 18:09.925
Any idea why?No.

18:09.968 --> 18:11.406
You or your dad had
problems with anyone?

18:11.450 --> 18:13.237
Uh, upset anybody?

18:13.281 --> 18:15.416
No.

18:15.460 --> 18:16.942
[sighs]

18:16.985 --> 18:19.077
Y-Your shoulder's dislocated.

18:19.121 --> 18:20.428
Yeah. Feels like it.

18:20.472 --> 18:22.564
I-I know how to
relocate a shoulder.[stammers]

18:22.607 --> 18:24.612
I don't--
I'm not sure you do. Whoa.

18:24.656 --> 18:25.920
[shouts]

18:27.750 --> 18:29.624
[exhales]

18:33.024 --> 18:35.552
[chuckles]
Thank you.

18:38.908 --> 18:40.824
JIMMY:
Uh, hey, there.

18:40.869 --> 18:43.441
So, what do you think
of the old neighborhood?

18:43.483 --> 18:45.314
[groans]Just like you remembered?

18:45.358 --> 18:48.627
So many people.
Just too many people.

18:48.669 --> 18:50.457
Just got a little overwhelming.

18:50.500 --> 18:52.636
She's okay?
RITA: Just needs
to rest a while.

18:52.679 --> 18:53.856
Bad times come and go,

18:53.900 --> 18:55.077
and unfortunately,
that's not gonna change.

18:55.121 --> 18:56.559
MENA:
Where are you
taking me?

18:56.602 --> 18:58.389
I want to leave right now.No-- It's okay.

18:58.433 --> 19:01.179
We're gonna go upstairs,
and you can lie down.Rita?

19:01.223 --> 19:02.878
No.
Yeah.

19:02.922 --> 19:05.189
No. Cassius hates it
when I stay too late.

19:05.232 --> 19:07.019
I don't want to make
him mad at me anymore.

19:07.063 --> 19:08.762
The Trutone
is your bar now, Mena.

19:08.805 --> 19:09.720
Just think about

19:09.765 --> 19:11.857
all the good times
you had here.

19:11.899 --> 19:13.120
All those beautiful songs.

19:13.164 --> 19:16.041
But you know
how upset Cassius gets.I do.

19:16.085 --> 19:18.655
I do. But he's gone now.

19:18.700 --> 19:20.537
You're safe now.

19:20.579 --> 19:22.952
Cassius can't hurt you anymore.

19:25.941 --> 19:28.710
You're Carla's boy.

19:28.755 --> 19:32.139
I knew it the
minute I saw you.

19:32.183 --> 19:35.260
It's okay, you know.

19:35.305 --> 19:39.480
It's okay. I'm glad you
and Dwayne found each other.

19:39.525 --> 19:42.206
Me, too.[chuckles]

19:42.250 --> 19:44.095
That's good.

19:46.865 --> 19:49.239
Hey, let's, uh,
go upstairs, okay?

19:49.283 --> 19:52.316
Yeah. Yeah, right.

19:57.767 --> 19:59.305
Chopper's shifting to the east.

19:59.349 --> 20:01.371
So far, no sign of
Rachel or the shooters.

20:01.415 --> 20:03.173
What's wrong?

20:03.217 --> 20:04.756
You haven't heard
from Tammy, have you?

20:04.800 --> 20:07.085
Not since she left with
that Covington cop. Why?

20:07.129 --> 20:09.504
She hasn't checked in, all my
calls are going to voice mail.

20:09.547 --> 20:11.305
Covington PD can't
reach Breaux, either.

20:11.349 --> 20:12.755
Mm, they were heading
to Kinnaman's property.

20:12.800 --> 20:14.471
Folsom, I think she said.

20:14.514 --> 20:16.492
Yeah, I know where it is.
Tell Pride to meet us there.

20:19.877 --> 20:22.427
You asked me earlier
about my struggles.

20:22.470 --> 20:24.800
What do you struggle with?My dad says that

20:24.845 --> 20:27.790
I-I worry too much,
that I can't let things go.

20:27.833 --> 20:30.164
Do you agree with him?

20:30.206 --> 20:31.614
Sometimes.

20:31.659 --> 20:32.889
So what do you do about it?

20:32.933 --> 20:34.383
Uh, research.

20:34.427 --> 20:36.185
That's how I knew
about this place.

20:36.229 --> 20:39.394
Yeah? But why creepy,
abandoned power plants

20:39.438 --> 20:41.857
and not, like,
K-pop or makeup or something?

20:41.900 --> 20:44.890
This place still
leaches toxic runoff.

20:44.932 --> 20:47.131
I've written 349 e-mails
to my local parish rep

20:47.175 --> 20:49.857
about getting it decontaminated.

20:49.900 --> 20:51.271
Well, let me get
this straight.

20:51.300 --> 20:57.039
You do research about humanity's
downfall just so you can relax?

20:57.086 --> 20:59.924
Knowing how things work helps.

20:59.968 --> 21:01.429
Yeah, I kind of get that.

21:01.471 --> 21:03.149
'Cause in my job, I have to know

21:03.191 --> 21:05.943
how the bad guy thinks, and
it's kind of scary, but, like,

21:05.987 --> 21:08.566
I don't know,
I feel better knowing, you know?

21:08.609 --> 21:11.619
And, and that helps you relax?

21:11.662 --> 21:14.543
Nah. I'm more of a red wine
and Golden Girlstype.

21:14.586 --> 21:16.735
Wine contaminates
the gut's microbiome.

21:16.779 --> 21:19.100
I-I told my dad all about it.

21:19.142 --> 21:22.238
[chuckling]: I'm sure
he totally appreciated that.

21:24.302 --> 21:28.301
My dad is okay... right?

21:31.310 --> 21:32.256
Well...[glass crunching]

21:35.266 --> 21:36.598
Get down.

21:37.329 --> 21:39.480
Get down.

21:56.075 --> 21:57.495
[whispering]:
Follow me. Stay low.

21:57.536 --> 21:59.601
Okay.
Come on.

22:01.578 --> 22:04.115
Come on.
Uh--

22:04.158 --> 22:05.749
I'm-I'm not
getting in there.

22:05.792 --> 22:07.641
Oh, no, this isn't
up for debate, sweetie.

22:07.684 --> 22:09.017
I can help...

22:09.059 --> 22:11.339
You can help by staying
in there. Okay? Shh, shh.

22:13.875 --> 22:16.757
[exhales]

22:21.658 --> 22:23.721
Where are we at?

22:23.765 --> 22:26.903
Judging by the hat
and the bike,

22:26.946 --> 22:29.698
we think Tammy and Officer
Breaux found Rachel.

22:29.740 --> 22:31.245
Shooters must have
followed them here.

22:31.288 --> 22:34.211
Any idea which way
Rachel and Tammy headed?

22:34.255 --> 22:37.953
Footprints lead down there,
but then the trail disappears.

22:37.996 --> 22:40.403
We've got more dogs on
the way, and every agency

22:40.446 --> 22:42.080
on the north shore
is searching.

22:42.123 --> 22:43.499
Nearest town's ten miles away.

22:43.542 --> 22:46.121
Khoury, I got Gregorio's phone.

22:46.164 --> 22:48.443
Busted. It looks like she left
it so it'd be easy to find.

22:48.486 --> 22:50.077
Where are you, Carter?

22:50.120 --> 22:51.753
Uh, about a mile northwest
of the treehouse.

22:51.797 --> 22:53.689
Tammy would've wanted
to go somewhere

22:53.731 --> 22:55.022
that she could use
to her advantage.

22:55.063 --> 22:57.772
Fontainebleau
Power Station.

22:57.816 --> 22:59.836
It's a couple
miles away.

22:59.880 --> 23:03.362
Rachel had a folder of
research on her hard drive

23:03.405 --> 23:05.770
dedicated solely
to that plant.

23:05.813 --> 23:08.049
Carter?
We're gonna send you coordinates

23:08.091 --> 23:09.209
for the Fontainebleau
Power Station.

23:09.253 --> 23:11.058
Meet you there.Roger that.

23:23.484 --> 23:24.730
[clatters]

23:46.830 --> 23:48.679
Hey.

24:00.674 --> 24:02.351
I told you to stay up there.

24:02.393 --> 24:04.113
I heard shots. I wanted
to make sure you were okay.

24:04.157 --> 24:06.435
I am, let's run![whimpers]

24:11.294 --> 24:12.498
Oh!Oh!

24:12.542 --> 24:13.659
GREGORIO:
Oh!

24:13.702 --> 24:16.066
[gasps]
Oh, God...

24:16.110 --> 24:17.400
Give me that, give me
that, stay back!

24:19.850 --> 24:21.527
Ahh![wrench hits floor]

24:26.342 --> 24:27.589
Oh, God!

24:27.633 --> 24:31.029
[gunshots]

24:40.316 --> 24:42.766
[breathing heavily]

24:42.810 --> 24:45.131
[quietly]:
I told you they'd come.

24:54.074 --> 24:55.891
I need to know his chances.

24:55.924 --> 24:58.735
Oh-- Well, you can ask
the doctors all your questions

24:58.780 --> 25:01.414
when we get to the
hospital, sweetie.

25:01.459 --> 25:03.479
This won't open.
I need this open.

25:03.523 --> 25:06.641
Rachel.Okay. It's all--
I got it.

25:08.706 --> 25:10.727
Here you go.

25:10.770 --> 25:13.054
Uh, what-what kind of surgery
is it?

25:13.098 --> 25:15.118
I need to know the name
of it so I can determine

25:15.162 --> 25:16.129
my dad's
survival rate.

25:16.172 --> 25:17.227
GREGORIO:
Hey.

25:17.271 --> 25:19.643
What is it?

25:19.686 --> 25:22.102
Okay.
Look at me.

25:24.036 --> 25:25.880
Deep breath.
Come on.

25:25.923 --> 25:28.779
Deep.

25:28.823 --> 25:30.579
Good.

25:30.623 --> 25:31.941
So my buddy Hannah's
at the hospital right now,

25:31.985 --> 25:34.620
making sure it's safe.

25:34.664 --> 25:36.905
We can go there, and you can ask
all the questions you want,

25:36.948 --> 25:38.529
I promise.

25:38.573 --> 25:41.077
[sniffles]

25:41.121 --> 25:42.922
You should have
told me he was hurt.

25:42.966 --> 25:44.942
GREGORIO:
Yeah, maybe.

25:44.986 --> 25:47.006
I figured you had enough
to worry about, you know?

25:47.050 --> 25:49.071
I'm sorry.

25:50.256 --> 25:52.058
Why don't we get you
something to eat?

25:52.101 --> 25:53.814
Then we'll go to your house
and get your medication,

25:53.859 --> 25:56.493
and then I'll take you to the
hospital to see your dad, okay?

25:56.538 --> 25:58.734
Sound good?
All right.

25:58.777 --> 26:00.754
Come on.

26:00.798 --> 26:02.818
Right over there.

26:04.268 --> 26:05.673
Feeling all right?

26:05.717 --> 26:08.704
Peachy. Be even better
when we find the sons of bitches

26:08.748 --> 26:11.427
responsible
for this.

26:11.471 --> 26:12.979
You speak to Rachel's aunt?

26:13.009 --> 26:15.180
Yeah, she's booking the first
flight here from Tucson.

26:15.222 --> 26:17.862
Good. Rachel needs
a familiar face.

26:17.904 --> 26:19.905
Yeah, but until we figure out
who hired those guys,

26:19.947 --> 26:22.587
Rachel and her father
could still be in danger.

26:22.629 --> 26:24.460
Yeah, go see
Sebastian at the lab.

26:24.502 --> 26:27.908
Find out if he got anything
off the bodies that might

26:27.950 --> 26:29.567
point us in the
right direction.

26:29.611 --> 26:30.547
Okay.

26:30.590 --> 26:32.037
Hey, Pride.

26:32.080 --> 26:33.314
I need to talk to you.

26:33.357 --> 26:35.145
You got something for us, Plame?

26:35.187 --> 26:37.060
All right,
I'm-a stop you right there.

26:37.103 --> 26:39.699
The name is Patton,
or Triple P.

26:39.742 --> 26:41.232
Now, since you're new,
I'm gonna let it slide,

26:41.275 --> 26:42.807
but just this once.

26:42.849 --> 26:44.723
And when I say I need
to talk to Pride,

26:44.765 --> 26:46.425
I meanPride.

26:46.467 --> 26:48.682
Guess that's my cue.

26:52.725 --> 26:55.493
Hey, I know you told me
not to look into Red.

26:55.536 --> 26:56.940
But you did.

26:56.982 --> 26:58.600
I couldn't
help myself.

26:58.643 --> 27:01.027
There's someone upstairs
to see you.

27:06.007 --> 27:08.476
Goodness...

27:08.519 --> 27:10.434
little Dwayne Pride.

27:10.477 --> 27:11.754
Clarence.

27:11.796 --> 27:14.265
C-- Clarence Redding?

27:14.308 --> 27:17.203
No need to be so formal.

27:17.246 --> 27:19.841
You always just called me Red.

27:29.804 --> 27:34.358
...and when I heard
you were asking about me,

27:34.401 --> 27:38.530
I figured it was time to...
come home.

27:38.572 --> 27:41.978
I was certain
I saw you die.

27:42.020 --> 27:45.469
If it's any consolation...
[chuckles]

27:45.511 --> 27:48.193
I was pretty sure
I was dead, too.

27:48.235 --> 27:50.449
I barely survived
your daddy's beating.

27:50.491 --> 27:53.387
That Cassius's work?
Yeah.

27:53.429 --> 27:55.930
Most everything else healed.

27:55.969 --> 27:59.067
Tell the truth,
I kind of like having it.

27:59.111 --> 28:02.992
It always reminds me of the life

28:03.037 --> 28:04.825
I had here.

28:04.869 --> 28:06.439
Most of it damn good.

28:06.483 --> 28:07.748
What happened
that night?

28:07.792 --> 28:09.667
[sighs]

28:09.711 --> 28:12.590
I saw a piercing white light,

28:12.634 --> 28:15.818
just like
in the stories.

28:15.862 --> 28:18.567
Convinced I was in heaven.

28:18.610 --> 28:20.923
Then I saw Cassius,

28:20.966 --> 28:25.197
and realized
I was in his car.

28:25.241 --> 28:28.295
He had just opened
the damned trunk. [chuckles]

28:28.339 --> 28:29.822
Brought you somewhere
to kill you.

28:29.866 --> 28:31.218
No, no, no.

28:31.262 --> 28:35.231
Cassius drove me out to Stark's,
right by the border.

28:35.276 --> 28:38.460
Said if I didn't leave Louisiana
for good,

28:38.503 --> 28:41.774
cut all ties with Mena,
he'd kill me.

28:41.818 --> 28:44.698
And her, too.

28:44.741 --> 28:46.791
That's why
you disappeared.

28:46.835 --> 28:50.412
That man chased me away
from everything I held dear.

28:53.073 --> 28:55.429
Now look, Dwayne.

28:55.473 --> 29:00.010
I've lived a good life.
Moved to Texas,

29:00.053 --> 29:01.450
met a wonderful woman.

29:01.493 --> 29:05.681
We opened a piano bar
outside Amarillo.

29:05.725 --> 29:07.295
She passed a while back,

29:07.338 --> 29:11.134
but we had a lot of good years.

29:11.178 --> 29:12.442
My one real regret

29:12.486 --> 29:16.543
was that I never
got to tell you and your mother

29:16.587 --> 29:18.462
I was okay.

29:18.507 --> 29:22.563
To say a proper goodbye.

29:22.607 --> 29:24.614
Red, I'm...

29:26.270 --> 29:29.761
I'm so s--
sorry...

29:29.805 --> 29:31.986
You've got nothing
to be sorry for.

29:32.029 --> 29:34.386
But I-I do, though.

29:34.429 --> 29:37.396
I'm the one who told Cassius.

29:39.490 --> 29:42.150
He went after you
because of me.You think your daddy

29:42.194 --> 29:44.855
wouldn't have found out
what was going on

29:44.898 --> 29:46.295
one way or another?

29:46.338 --> 29:49.436
You know
the kind of man he was.

29:49.480 --> 29:54.409
The only people responsible
for what happened that night

29:54.453 --> 29:56.939
are me and Cassius Pride.

29:58.945 --> 30:01.476
Not you.

30:03.657 --> 30:05.446
So...

30:05.490 --> 30:08.324
you still play piano?

30:08.368 --> 30:10.855
I dabble.
[chuckles]

30:10.898 --> 30:13.341
And Mena?

30:14.912 --> 30:16.744
I hope she's well.

30:16.788 --> 30:19.929
Had her ups and downs.

30:19.972 --> 30:22.110
But still going strong.

30:22.154 --> 30:23.986
I don't suppose

30:24.029 --> 30:26.124
she would want
to see me

30:26.167 --> 30:29.177
after all this time?

30:30.574 --> 30:33.714
I would sure love
to see her.

30:33.759 --> 30:37.597
It might be hard for her.

30:39.604 --> 30:41.436
[quietly]:
Yeah.

30:47.805 --> 30:51.469
Hey, Slim, you get anything
useful off those hit men?

30:51.513 --> 30:55.613
Nope, just some trace
I'm analyzing right now, Flash.

30:55.657 --> 30:57.708
Uh, Flash?
Yeah.

30:57.752 --> 30:59.147
See how you're calling
me "Slim" all the time?

30:59.191 --> 31:00.499
Well, I'm gonna
call you "Flash."

31:00.543 --> 31:02.637
And not 'cause of
Flash Gordon, or the Flash--

31:02.681 --> 31:03.902
because of your clothes.

31:03.946 --> 31:05.298
'Cause they're so flash--
they're flashy.

31:05.341 --> 31:07.741
Sure. Maybe keep working
on that.

31:07.785 --> 31:09.922
What kind of trace
did you find?

31:09.966 --> 31:12.365
Some kind of
a hydraulic fluid.

31:12.408 --> 31:14.939
Sebastian?
I have IDs on the two killers.

31:14.983 --> 31:16.639
Ah...

31:16.684 --> 31:17.993
I'm guessing
you must be

31:18.036 --> 31:20.043
the new agent ruffling
all the feathers.

31:20.087 --> 31:22.791
[laughing]
Is that right?

31:22.835 --> 31:24.667
Quentin Carter.
You must be Dr. Wade.

31:24.711 --> 31:27.502
Oh-- is that
Lancôme Tresor?

31:27.546 --> 31:29.641
Mm, he knows
his perfumes.

31:29.684 --> 31:30.992
CARTER:
Yeah, my mother
wears the same one.

31:31.036 --> 31:33.567
I appreciate a woman
with good taste.

31:34.918 --> 31:36.211
Pleasure to meet you, Quentin.[laughs]

31:36.253 --> 31:39.052
Hey, you know, I like
your perfume, too.

31:39.096 --> 31:40.861
I just, I haven't had
a chance to say it.

31:40.905 --> 31:42.886
Mm. Now, Dr. Wade, you were
saying you were able

31:42.928 --> 31:44.176
to ID the two men?

31:44.220 --> 31:45.727
I sent the information to you.

31:45.771 --> 31:48.957
It's, uh, Andres Cutter
and Elias Hansen.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.928
SEBASTIAN:
Oh, yeah. Looks like
they worked for some kind

31:51.972 --> 31:54.598
of Blackwater-style outfit
called Aranco.

31:54.641 --> 31:55.761
CARTER:
Mm. Aranco's
mostly mercenaries.

31:55.803 --> 31:57.742
Somebody brought in big guns

31:57.784 --> 31:59.808
to take out a naval
engineer and his daughter.

31:59.851 --> 32:01.660
And you still don't know
why they were targeted?

32:01.703 --> 32:03.252
No, no, but we'll start
digging into these two,

32:03.296 --> 32:04.631

out who hired them.

32:04.675 --> 32:05.664
[computer beeps]Oh.

32:07.860 --> 32:11.133
Looks like the trace
on the boots was from

32:11.176 --> 32:13.157
a hydraulic fluid
called Hydra-Flight.

32:13.201 --> 32:15.138
It's used for airplanes.

32:15.180 --> 32:16.602
Mm. So no connection
to Kinnaman.

32:16.645 --> 32:17.722
His focus was strictly

32:17.764 --> 32:19.572
naval facility engineering.

32:19.616 --> 32:22.114
You know, Patton mentioned
that most of Rachel's research

32:22.156 --> 32:24.095
was focused on major
transportation risks.

32:24.137 --> 32:27.109
Like airplanes.
That's good, Slim, very good.

32:27.151 --> 32:28.616

32:39.424 --> 32:42.180
I rather like him.

32:42.224 --> 32:44.247
And the way he dresses.

32:44.290 --> 32:46.788
So this is the taste
of betrayal.

32:46.830 --> 32:48.252
Wow.

32:50.189 --> 32:52.945
Hey. Ben Kinnaman
is out of surgery.

32:52.989 --> 32:54.195
Doctors said he's doing well,
but, you know,

32:54.238 --> 32:55.444
it's still touch and go.

32:55.485 --> 32:56.649
Will he survive?

32:56.691 --> 32:58.156

in a few hours.

the two thugs.

Looks like Rachel
may have been

33:09.309 --> 33:11.032
the target all along.

33:11.074 --> 33:12.840
But she's just a teenager.

33:12.882 --> 33:15.466
Rachel is the most relentless
researcher I've ever seen.

33:15.509 --> 33:17.405
Her recent subject
of interest

33:17.446 --> 33:19.255
is airline travel.

33:19.299 --> 33:21.022
Kinnaman wanted to travel
to his sister's wedding

33:21.064 --> 33:24.293
on a regional airline
called Zion Air.

33:24.337 --> 33:26.404
Yeah, I know Zion Air. They had
a lot of trouble last year.

33:26.447 --> 33:28.729
That's exactly why Rachel
was looking into them.

33:28.773 --> 33:31.787
Zion had several mechanical
issues. No accidents,

33:31.830 --> 33:33.853
but a ton of delays
and cancellations

33:33.897 --> 33:35.920
and a lot of bad publicity.

33:35.964 --> 33:37.470
Airline nearly went bankrupt.

33:37.513 --> 33:39.408
Got bought out by
an investor group.

33:39.451 --> 33:41.820
What does this
have to do with Rachel?Rachel's research

33:41.862 --> 33:45.092
revealed the statistical
improbability that any airline

33:45.136 --> 33:47.633
could have that many issues
in such a short timeframe.

33:47.677 --> 33:49.398
PATTON:
Rachel exchanged

33:49.441 --> 33:51.378
a lot of e-mails with the chief
safety officer of the company.

33:51.422 --> 33:53.359
She was convinced

33:53.403 --> 33:55.686
that all their problems
had been intentional.

33:55.729 --> 33:56.977
Sounds like someone
sabotaged the airline.

33:57.020 --> 33:59.820
What do we know about
this chief safety officer?

33:59.862 --> 34:02.015
His name is Kendall Veidt.
He's been with Zion

34:02.059 --> 34:04.341
since before
all the trouble started.

34:04.383 --> 34:06.106
Zion offices are out
by the airport.

34:06.149 --> 34:07.312
I'll have Carter and Sebastian

34:07.355 --> 34:09.551
go by and see if Veidt's there.

34:09.594 --> 34:11.574
I'll get his home address.

34:11.619 --> 34:13.210
PATTON:
The last e-mail
Rachel sent to Veidt,

34:13.255 --> 34:15.408
she threatened to call the FAA,
tell them everything,

34:15.449 --> 34:17.172
if they didn't
come clean themselves.

34:17.217 --> 34:19.326
That's the reason why
this jerk tried to kill them?

34:19.369 --> 34:21.478

that he was trying

34:21.522 --> 34:23.245
to sabotage his own company?PRIDE:

34:47.315 --> 34:48.558
Kendall Veidt's not at work.

34:48.591 --> 34:50.248
No one's seen him
since yesterday.

34:50.291 --> 34:51.774
Just talked to NOPD.

34:51.819 --> 34:54.565
Went by his house,
no sign of him there, either.

34:54.608 --> 34:55.786
No, but we found
something interesting.

34:55.829 --> 34:58.010
The investor group
that bought Zion Airlines

34:58.053 --> 35:00.234
after all the incidents,
it's just a shell company.

35:00.277 --> 35:01.760
Checked with a contact of mine
at the FBI.

35:01.803 --> 35:03.417
She says that
the shell corporation

35:03.461 --> 35:04.900
has deep ties
to the Medellín Cartel.

35:04.944 --> 35:07.385
The cartel?Yeah. We think Veidt

35:07.428 --> 35:09.784
is sabotaging the planes to
drive the company's price down.

35:09.827 --> 35:11.790
So they can acquire Zion
for dirt cheap.

35:11.833 --> 35:15.844
Then the cartel could have its
very own FAA-licensed airline.

35:15.888 --> 35:17.457
Lots of uses for an airline.
Laundering money,

35:17.502 --> 35:19.088
smuggling weapons, drugs.

35:19.148 --> 35:20.643
Makes sense
why Veidt

35:20.685 --> 35:22.609
would hire hit men.The cartel
must have sunk

35:22.650 --> 35:24.573
millions into that deal.

35:24.616 --> 35:29.744
Means Veidt will keep coming
until the Kinnamans are dead.
