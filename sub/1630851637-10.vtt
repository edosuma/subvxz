06:28.154 --> 06:31.222
I'm still probably gonna be

06:34.426 --> 06:36.761

- Yes.

06:36.763 --> 06:39.431
- And so, I need that
to cinch me here.

06:39.498 --> 06:40.865
- Yeah.
- Because I've got the boobs.

06:40.933 --> 06:42.767
And I'm very confident
showing that.

06:42.769 --> 06:47.238

07:04.924 --> 07:06.859

- Guess I got my money's worth.

07:08.161 --> 07:10.695
You can give me pants.
You can give me a jacket.

07:10.697 --> 07:11.997
I will be good in anything.

07:11.999 --> 07:15.800
- My question, actually,
is it should be dress?

07:15.802 --> 07:18.738
Or it should be--it actually
can be a suit?

07:20.139 --> 07:21.807
- It can be whatever
you want it to be.

07:21.874 --> 07:23.274
If you think
you can make a suit.

07:23.342 --> 07:25.143
- Of course I can.

07:25.211 --> 07:27.746
Clients think they know
what they want,

07:27.748 --> 07:33.084
and it's important to sell
your idea and your vibe.

07:33.086 --> 07:34.018
- We can tone this down.

07:34.086 --> 07:36.287
I'm not a designer.
I have a clothing line.

07:36.289 --> 07:38.690
But I really would love to be

07:38.757 --> 07:42.360
like a sexy Disney princess.

07:42.428 --> 07:43.361
- Oh.

07:43.429 --> 07:46.497
I don't do Disney princess.

07:46.499 --> 07:48.967
I do more like
a warrior goddess.

07:48.969 --> 07:52.103
- What if I had butterflies,
like, on the tulle?

07:52.171 --> 07:53.839
Like, my dress is alive.

07:53.906 --> 07:55.473
- I just want to tell you...
- Mm-hmm.

07:55.541 --> 07:58.544
- If you measure me,
I'm going down.

07:58.610 --> 08:01.313
I bought cut carrots,
celery, cucumbers.

08:01.380 --> 08:02.714
I've been on a cleanse.

08:02.781 --> 08:06.117
This right here, (BLEEP)

08:06.185 --> 08:08.554
We don't--we don't
want to show that.

08:08.620 --> 08:09.855
- So, talk to me
about what you want.

08:09.922 --> 08:10.689
What do you like?

08:10.756 --> 08:12.190
What do you want to feel like?

08:12.258 --> 08:12.991
What do you want to look like?

08:13.058 --> 08:14.993
- I'm very traditional.
- Okay.

08:14.995 --> 08:17.395
<i>- In our show, you are not
allowed to wear a long dress.</i>

08:17.463 --> 08:20.231
<i>So, O.C. reunion,
you gotta wear short.</i>

08:20.299 --> 08:23.368
But I'm not gonna lie,
like, I like a knee here.

08:23.370 --> 08:24.769
Like, you're gonna hate me.

08:24.771 --> 08:26.572
I have to wear a bra.

08:26.638 --> 08:27.806
Otherwise,
they'd be down to here.

08:27.808 --> 08:28.808
- You look great, though.

08:28.874 --> 08:30.676
<i>- I like to have
my arms covered.</i>

08:30.743 --> 08:32.744
<i>I'm not a girl
that likes to stand out.</i>

08:32.746 --> 08:34.145
I kind of like to blend
in a little bit.

08:34.147 --> 08:35.680
- So, how do you feel
about this?

08:35.748 --> 08:37.148
- I'm not a feather person.
- You're not?

08:37.150 --> 08:39.083
But you're wearing feathers
on your shoes!

08:39.151 --> 08:40.752
It's definitely
a little contradictory

08:40.819 --> 08:42.287
that she's telling me
she doesn't want to stand out,

18:14.259 --> 18:15.726
Thanks, ma'am, so much.
- Mm-hmm.

18:15.728 --> 18:18.463
<i>- They need to love their looks.</i>

18:20.766 --> 18:22.800
- Did you decide on what bottom
you're doing?

18:22.802 --> 18:24.335
- I'm doing half-lingerie...

18:24.403 --> 18:26.504
- Yes!
- You know, like, very sexy,

18:26.571 --> 18:29.540
and half, like, suit.
I just hope she likes it.

18:29.608 --> 18:31.509
<i>I have a moment of clarity
right now.</i>

18:31.577 --> 18:33.410
Instead of, like, a wrap dress,

18:33.478 --> 18:36.881
I'm going to do a half-suit,
half-lingerie.

18:36.948 --> 18:38.850
<i>I haven't done this before,
but I think</i>

18:38.917 --> 18:41.251
<i>that it will be very
interesting and different,</i>

18:41.320 --> 18:43.121
instead of, like,
a classic dress.

18:44.289 --> 18:46.090
- Hi, everybody.
- Good morning, Christian.

18:46.158 --> 18:47.358
- Hi, Christian.
- Hi.

18:47.425 --> 18:49.493
- How's it going?
- It's going.

18:49.495 --> 18:51.029
- All right, Chasity,
what's going on?

18:51.096 --> 18:54.299
- Oh, my God.
I have Mrs. Karen Huger.

18:54.365 --> 18:56.433
- Okay.
- She loves cleavage.

18:56.501 --> 18:57.768
- Okay.
- Sparkle.

18:57.836 --> 18:58.903
- Okay.

18:58.970 --> 19:01.772
- She was open to all colors
except orange and brown.

19:01.774 --> 19:02.740
- So, you gave her black.

19:02.808 --> 19:04.509
- Yeah, when she came in
with that black suit,

19:04.576 --> 19:06.611
I was like,
that exudes power to me.

19:10.783 --> 19:12.516
- I do think you need
to figure out,

19:12.584 --> 19:16.787
what is the new, interesting
fashion element here?

19:16.855 --> 19:18.790
Right now,
it's a beaded bustier,

19:18.857 --> 19:21.226
like, black gown.

19:21.292 --> 19:23.394
- Yeah.
But when the client wants--

19:23.461 --> 19:25.864
- Oh, 'cause she said,
"I wanted a fully-beaded gown"?

19:25.931 --> 19:27.065
- Maybe.

19:27.132 --> 19:28.400
- The challenge is, like,

19:28.466 --> 19:30.769
in the group of people
that are left,

19:30.835 --> 19:35.740
who is the next great
fashion innovator and thinker?

19:35.807 --> 19:37.609
Good luck. Goodbye.

19:37.676 --> 19:39.777
<i>- I understand what Christian
is saying, but respectfully,</i>

19:39.844 --> 19:42.947
I'll probably listen more
to my client than Christian,

19:43.014 --> 19:46.117
because my client
has to wear that dress.

19:48.753 --> 19:50.221
- All right, Anna.
- Hi, Christian.

19:50.288 --> 19:51.555
- Hi.
- Hi.

19:51.557 --> 19:53.424
- Who's your Housewife?
- Gina.

19:53.491 --> 19:56.093
- Gina.
- Yes. She likes structure.

19:56.161 --> 19:59.264
- Okay.
- Form. No lace. No pink.

19:59.330 --> 20:00.764
She mentioned that
she like shoulder pads,

20:00.832 --> 20:03.768
so I'm making this
structured shoulder for her.

20:03.835 --> 20:06.971
- Yeah, they're cool.
And what happens underneath?

20:07.038 --> 20:09.506
- I'm making a pencil skirt
underneath.

20:09.574 --> 20:11.776
- What, you're gonna make
a pencil skirt?

20:11.843 --> 20:13.111
No. It's a pencil skirt.

20:13.178 --> 20:14.378
- Yes, it's a--

20:14.446 --> 20:16.513
- Anybody can make,
in ten minutes.

20:16.581 --> 20:19.217
Is there manipulation?
Is there texture?

20:19.285 --> 20:20.719
Is there pleating?

20:20.785 --> 20:22.454
Maybe the challenges
are getting in your head...

20:22.520 --> 20:23.921
- Mm-hmm.
- Like, what they have to be.

20:23.989 --> 20:27.257
And I think the judges
really want ideas now.

20:27.259 --> 20:29.227
You can't run out of steam.
- Okay.

20:29.295 --> 20:30.595
<i>I'm so confused,</i>

20:30.662 --> 20:32.731
<i>because I'm happy
with my design.</i>

20:32.797 --> 20:36.333
But I will take
Christian's advice.

20:36.401 --> 20:37.801
- Now--

20:37.869 --> 20:39.369
<i>- I will change the pencil skirt</i>

20:39.438 --> 20:41.540
into a structured pencil skirt.

20:43.608 --> 20:45.743
- Bones.
- I got Miss Shannon.

20:45.810 --> 20:47.511
And when I met with her,

20:47.513 --> 20:50.215
she didn't want to really
accentuate her waist.

20:50.282 --> 20:53.251
She wants to cover her arms.
And she wants to wear black.

20:53.319 --> 20:54.952
Then I started making this,
like,

20:54.954 --> 20:56.654
straight-down black dress,

20:56.721 --> 20:58.990
and it just looked,
like, really boring.

20:59.057 --> 21:01.025
So, I just started
draping this this morning.,

21:01.092 --> 21:03.028
I'm gonna go with, like,
a boat neck in the front.

21:03.094 --> 21:04.428
- How do you balance it?
- Mm-hmm.

21:04.430 --> 21:05.562
- You know, you want to give
the client

21:05.630 --> 21:07.397
what they want, obviously.
- Yeah.

21:07.466 --> 21:08.565
- You still have to be you.

21:08.633 --> 21:10.701
- Maybe I just do--like,
give her something

21:10.703 --> 21:12.870
really crazy, rock and roll,
see-through up top.

21:12.937 --> 21:16.374
- Into a sleeve or into,
you know, something else.

21:16.441 --> 21:18.042
- She was like,
"Do you. Do you,"

21:18.109 --> 21:19.811
- Yeah. I think you have
to just say--be like,

21:19.878 --> 21:22.914
"Listen, I really need to do me
a little bit more, because"--

21:22.981 --> 21:24.715
- She gotta understand
that I gotta stay here.

21:24.783 --> 21:26.050
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Thanks, C-Dog.

21:26.052 --> 21:27.184
- Go.
- Appreciate it.

21:27.252 --> 21:28.386
- C-Dog? Come on!

21:28.453 --> 21:30.054
- I like it.
- After all that advice?

21:30.122 --> 21:33.358
- All right, C-Pup.
- Yeah, I'm younger than a dog.

21:38.130 --> 21:39.797
- Who do you have?
- I have Gizelle.

21:39.799 --> 21:42.067
- Ah, fabulous.
- Yeah. She's fantastic.

21:42.133 --> 21:44.601
It's a jumpsuit.
Corseted underneath.

21:44.669 --> 21:46.538
- Oh, I thought the corset
was on top.

21:46.604 --> 21:48.072
- You will catch glimpses
of that--

21:48.074 --> 21:49.940
- What if it is on top?

21:50.008 --> 21:51.876
- This can carry down
into something.

21:51.943 --> 21:53.511
- So many more things
you could do.

21:53.578 --> 21:54.813
- I feel that.

21:56.481 --> 21:57.415
- Who'd you get?
What are you doing?

21:57.482 --> 21:59.950
- I have Dr. Wendy.

22:00.018 --> 22:02.287
- And she's got
a lot of personality.

22:02.354 --> 22:04.588
- Yes. So, I choose this color.

22:04.656 --> 22:06.623
- So, you're gonna
cover it up this much?

22:06.691 --> 22:10.260
Like, this is like showing
now your tailored work...

22:10.328 --> 22:11.630
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

22:11.696 --> 22:13.463
- That you really haven't shown
the judges.

22:13.532 --> 22:15.432
So, we should show them.
Try it out.

22:15.500 --> 22:16.834
- Yes. I will.
- Just to see.

22:16.902 --> 22:18.102
- Mm-hmm.

22:18.169 --> 22:19.636
- Hello, Shantall.

22:19.704 --> 22:20.839
- Hello, Christian.

22:20.905 --> 22:22.707
- Who do you have?
What are you doing?

22:22.774 --> 22:25.642
- Luann. She wanted to be sexy,
but at the same time to have

22:25.710 --> 22:28.580
like a half of like a suit.

22:28.646 --> 22:31.648
- Could this even be more--
So, when she turns this way,

22:31.716 --> 22:33.317
she's in lingerie,
when she turns this way,

22:33.384 --> 22:35.018
she's in this, like, cool suit.

22:35.086 --> 22:37.522
- I definitely can do something
more dramatic.

22:37.589 --> 22:39.124
- All right. Good luck.
- Okay. Thank you.

22:39.190 --> 22:40.391
I'll need it.

22:41.660 --> 22:42.961
- How's it going?
- Good.

22:43.027 --> 22:44.928
- Tell me everything.
Who's your Housewife?

22:44.996 --> 22:47.598
- It's Leah.
- Leah is cool.

22:47.665 --> 22:49.867
- I'm very happy.
- She loves fashion.

22:49.869 --> 22:52.803
- She told me that she wanted
to be a princess,

22:52.805 --> 22:55.606
with ruffles and butterflies.

22:55.673 --> 22:57.008
- What? Okay, then--

22:57.075 --> 22:59.509
- But--but then she said,
"Maybe not butterflies.

22:59.578 --> 23:00.745
It's gonna be too much."

23:00.812 --> 23:02.479
- Oh, you think?
- And I don't--

23:02.547 --> 23:03.881
- And she loves nude?

23:03.948 --> 23:05.415
- We didn't discuss
about this color.

23:05.417 --> 23:06.951
- Oh.
- Nice.

23:06.953 --> 23:08.352
- So, what color
did she say she wanted?

23:08.420 --> 23:09.686
- She likes neons.

23:09.754 --> 23:11.088
- Neons?
- She likes pink...

23:11.090 --> 23:12.222
- Okay.

23:12.290 --> 23:14.091
- Navy, or emerald green.

23:14.159 --> 23:15.393
- You're killing me, Coral.

23:15.461 --> 23:17.361
- Well--
- You didn't give her anything?

23:17.363 --> 23:18.630
- Yeah, I know.

23:18.696 --> 23:20.564
- I really don't think
many of the Housewives

23:20.566 --> 23:21.832
would go for something
like this.

23:21.900 --> 23:22.866
- I know.

23:22.934 --> 23:25.535
- They want evening and beading
and neon colors,

23:25.604 --> 23:26.870
like she said.
- Mm-hmm.

23:26.938 --> 23:28.038
- But you just have
to convince her.

23:28.106 --> 23:28.773
- Yeah.

23:28.840 --> 23:31.642
Oh, Christian makes me nervous.

23:31.709 --> 23:33.178
I was so happy with this design.

23:33.244 --> 23:36.648
<i>But the color is not
what we talk about.</i>

23:36.714 --> 23:41.118
And it was a really huge risk
to buy this fabric.

23:41.186 --> 23:44.021
<i>So, I'm really hoping
that she likes it.</i>

23:45.725 --> 23:47.624
- Are we feeling ready?

23:47.692 --> 23:50.561
Who wants a fabulous model?

23:54.265 --> 23:55.999
- Hi. Hi, hi. How are you?

23:56.067 --> 23:58.002
- Whoo!
- Hi, honey. What have you got?

23:58.069 --> 23:59.937
- You look so cute.

24:00.005 --> 24:03.708
All: Hi. Hi.

24:03.775 --> 24:04.641
- Okay.

24:04.709 --> 24:06.410
- So, I thought
about you all night.

24:06.478 --> 24:07.577
- Thank you.
- Honestly--

24:07.646 --> 24:09.347
- Most men do. Most men do.
- Hey.

24:09.414 --> 24:10.415
- How are you?
- How are you?

24:10.482 --> 24:12.216
You look so cute.

24:12.283 --> 24:13.717
- I have my Spanx with me.

24:15.019 --> 24:17.621
- I've never done black
at the reunion,

24:17.689 --> 24:20.390
so this is really good.
I've always wanted to.

24:20.458 --> 24:22.092
So, thank you.

24:22.160 --> 24:24.362
- Oh, my God.

24:24.429 --> 24:28.499
- No, no, no. This color.
Wow.

24:29.235 --> 24:34.038
This is, like, totally, like,
not what I was ever expecting.

24:34.105 --> 24:35.439
- Oh, my goodness.

24:40.445 --> 24:42.045
- Oh, my God.

24:42.113 --> 24:45.382
This color. Wow.

24:45.450 --> 24:47.118
Oh, my ----ing God.

24:49.454 --> 24:53.724
This is epic! Thank you!

24:53.791 --> 24:55.993
- I'm so happy that you like it!

24:56.060 --> 24:57.294
- Oh, my God.

24:57.296 --> 24:58.929
- I'm so happy. I was worried.

24:58.997 --> 25:01.666
- This is everything.
It's way better

25:01.733 --> 25:04.402
than I ever could have come up
in my own head with.

25:04.404 --> 25:07.005
- It was a really huge risk

25:07.071 --> 25:10.208
to buy this fabric,
but it totally pay off.

25:10.275 --> 25:11.875
- Like, I ----ing love it.

25:11.877 --> 25:13.545
- Really?
- Yes! It's so cool!

25:13.611 --> 25:15.779
- That makes me so happy.
- This color--

25:15.781 --> 25:17.481
- This is a brightness
in a sea of--

25:17.549 --> 25:19.450
- Nonsense.
- Yeah.

25:20.919 --> 25:22.853
- These are pants.
- Honey.

25:22.921 --> 25:25.322
And I like the--
It's one sleeve.

25:25.324 --> 25:27.958
- So, and then you have, like,
an 18-piece corset.

25:28.026 --> 25:30.027
Baby, we're gonna snatch
the hell out of you.

25:30.094 --> 25:31.462
Hey, I'm down, baby.

25:33.331 --> 25:35.165
- It's good.

25:35.233 --> 25:37.901
I was so nervous.

25:37.903 --> 25:40.170
- Like, it's trousers
and a corset. We need to fit.

25:40.238 --> 25:43.073
- It's trousers?
- Yeah. This is a trousers.

25:44.976 --> 25:48.111
- Now, what's this?
- This is a dress. Yes.

25:48.179 --> 25:50.114
- It goes on top of the pants?
- Yes.

25:50.181 --> 25:52.250
That goes on top
of the pants and the corset.

25:52.317 --> 25:55.685
- Okay. I just thought we were
gonna show my legs off,

25:55.754 --> 25:57.422
'cause I have nice legs!

25:57.488 --> 25:58.722
- Let's try it.

25:58.724 --> 26:01.124
- Lord. Child.

26:01.192 --> 26:04.261
- This dress is like
half-suit, half-lingerie.

26:04.329 --> 26:06.330
- I love a good suit.

26:06.397 --> 26:07.998
- Gonna try it on?
- Yes.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.166
- You like it?
- I love this.

26:09.233 --> 26:11.001
- You sure?
- Oh, I love it. Yes.

26:11.003 --> 26:13.937
- Okay, so let's try stuff on.
- So, I gotta put my Spanx on.

26:13.939 --> 26:15.873
- All right.
So, you can go back here, and--

26:15.940 --> 26:17.608
- God, this is the worst part.

26:17.610 --> 26:19.142
- No, it's not.
It's the most exciting part!

26:19.210 --> 26:20.611
- I know. Okay. Okay--
- Come on, Shannon!

26:20.678 --> 26:22.512
Get your head in the game!

26:22.580 --> 26:23.513
- Oh.
- Yes?

26:23.581 --> 26:24.481
- Yes.
- Yes?

26:24.549 --> 26:26.149
- Yes.

26:26.217 --> 26:27.652
- I definitely feel a connection

26:27.718 --> 26:29.754
between Mrs. Karen and I.

26:29.821 --> 26:32.022
<i>I'm a fan of
her owning her own businesses</i>

26:32.090 --> 26:34.892
<i>while also being
a wife and a mother.</i>

26:34.894 --> 26:37.695
It's very inspiring to me.

26:37.762 --> 26:39.663
- Not a lot of artists

26:39.665 --> 26:41.999
get their client
the way you got me.

26:42.067 --> 26:44.201
- Our reunion looks
are supposed to be

26:44.203 --> 26:45.769
cocktail length or pants.

26:45.837 --> 26:48.872
- Oh!
- But it looks cool.

26:48.874 --> 26:51.008
I like that it's, like,
almost, like, a warrior vibe.

26:51.010 --> 26:52.977
And this is not,
actually, a party.

26:53.044 --> 26:55.480
It's like
a full-blown war, the reunion,

26:55.546 --> 26:56.848
where we all sit down on a couch

26:56.914 --> 26:58.583
and we just attack
each other like animals.

26:58.650 --> 26:59.583
Basically what this is.
- Oh, really?

26:59.585 --> 27:00.584
Oh.
- Yeah.

27:00.652 --> 27:01.985
- So, I personally think

27:02.053 --> 27:04.721
that this is not
flattering whatsoever.

27:04.789 --> 27:07.492
I don't know why
Gina's not annoyed about this.

27:07.558 --> 27:09.928
This is a disaster.
Oh, my God.

27:09.994 --> 27:12.063
- So, for the bottom,
this is definitely giving me,

27:12.130 --> 27:14.131
like, a grandma vibe,
'cause it's so long.

27:14.198 --> 27:15.633
And it should be something
like this.

27:15.701 --> 27:17.135
- Okay.

27:17.201 --> 27:18.268
- Do you think I'm gonna be
able to walk, though?

27:18.336 --> 27:20.871
- Let me see the whole look.
- The top, it's done?

27:20.939 --> 27:22.272
It's fit? Is it perfect?

27:22.274 --> 27:24.408
- The only thing we haven't--
- Lot of things.

27:24.410 --> 27:25.643
- Okay.

27:25.711 --> 27:26.944
- You gotta
figure out the front.

27:26.946 --> 27:27.812
You gotta figure out the sides.
- Okay.

27:27.879 --> 27:29.246
- Really fit it, Anna.

27:29.314 --> 27:30.348
- Okay.
- Okay?

27:30.415 --> 27:31.649
- Got it. Thank you.

27:31.717 --> 27:34.084
- I just want you to do
what your plan is,

27:34.152 --> 27:36.219
because you-you know
more than I.

27:36.287 --> 27:37.721
- Thank you very much.
- Yeah.

27:39.291 --> 27:40.224
- It's so me.

27:40.291 --> 27:43.227
My half-serious side
and my half-cabaret side.

27:43.229 --> 27:44.561
- So, you're an artist.
- Yeah, yeah.

27:44.629 --> 27:45.896
- You're, like, sexy.
- I love it.

27:45.964 --> 27:46.997
- Like, a little bit
of everything.

27:47.065 --> 27:48.365
- I love it.
- So.

27:48.433 --> 27:49.933
- Too hot.

27:49.935 --> 27:51.536
Like, incredibly hot.

27:51.602 --> 27:53.336
- Oh, thank you.
- And I love the A line.

27:53.404 --> 27:55.439
<i>This second dress
is definitely giving</i>

27:55.506 --> 27:57.241
<i>more reunion vibe.</i>

27:57.308 --> 27:59.177
<i>Like, when you're pointing
your finger at people,</i>

27:59.243 --> 28:01.745
I want all the feathers
to be, like, pointing too.

28:01.747 --> 28:03.614
<i>The feathers are gonna be
the statement of this piece.</i>

28:03.616 --> 28:06.383
- How close did you get to
the $700 budget is my question.

28:06.451 --> 28:08.051
- Oh, I spent $699.
- Are you serious?

28:08.053 --> 28:09.721
- Yeah.
- I love that.

28:14.325 --> 28:15.326
- How's it going?

28:18.530 --> 28:20.063
Like, right here.

28:20.065 --> 28:22.933
- I don't think
that Wendy's happy. I can tell.

28:23.001 --> 28:24.334
- The fit is a little bit weird.

28:24.336 --> 28:25.735
- Yeah.

28:25.737 --> 28:27.137
- But you don't want
to close them more.

28:27.139 --> 28:28.406
- When you say close,
you mean close this?

28:28.473 --> 28:30.340
- I'm feeling, like, here.

28:30.408 --> 28:32.275
- Yeah, you can do
whatever you want.

28:32.343 --> 28:34.412
I just feel like I have
to show something,

28:34.479 --> 28:37.815
because, like, we normally
don't wear pants at reunions.

28:38.983 --> 28:42.352
- Is it should be dress?
Or can be a suit?

28:42.354 --> 28:47.491
- Whatever is your aesthetic
that I will look good in.

28:47.558 --> 28:49.192
- Did you want a pant?
- No.

28:49.260 --> 28:50.894
- No.

28:50.962 --> 28:52.362
- I'm not anti-pant,

28:52.430 --> 28:55.165
but I just feel like
the pants are not fitted.

28:55.233 --> 28:57.968
I'm looking for where
the element of sexiness

28:58.035 --> 29:01.505
comes in for me,
in my personal style.

29:02.173 --> 29:04.341
- I mean, I don't know,
the pants are kind of fabulous.

29:04.343 --> 29:05.976
Like, but I get what you mean.

29:06.043 --> 29:07.210
Like, if you want a--
- Yeah.

29:07.278 --> 29:08.846
- More of a sexy--
- Yeah.

29:10.249 --> 29:11.916
What did I say?
I just asked a question.

29:11.983 --> 29:13.651
No, no, no, no.

29:13.718 --> 29:15.885
<i>- I asked you about the suit.</i>

29:15.954 --> 29:17.255
She never told me no.

29:17.321 --> 29:19.890
She never mentioned,
like, "I want a gown."

29:20.491 --> 29:22.392
- I mean, like, I-I didn't know
that you want, like,

29:22.460 --> 29:24.461
particular gown,
because, like, first thing

29:24.529 --> 29:27.831
I think I ask you, like,
how about the suit, you know?

29:27.833 --> 29:30.068
And it was my vision
how I would see you,

29:30.134 --> 29:32.135
with the more, like, sexy part.

29:32.137 --> 29:34.137
- But remember I said, like,
how I had, like, new boobies

29:34.139 --> 29:36.873
and a new butt, and I wanted
to accentuate those parts.

29:36.941 --> 29:39.576
I got my new boobies.
Gotta show it.

29:39.578 --> 29:42.513
My new butt. Gotta show it.

29:42.515 --> 29:44.147
We're gonna make it work.

29:44.215 --> 29:46.283
- For me, I work with clients
all the time.

29:46.350 --> 29:48.486
Like, I mostly do custom things.

29:48.553 --> 29:49.953
It takes a minute.

29:50.021 --> 29:52.490
<i>Kristina is very
well-educated in fashion.</i>

29:52.557 --> 29:55.358
But you can go to school,
you can learn the fundamentals,

29:55.426 --> 29:57.861
but until you start
working with clients,

29:57.929 --> 29:59.697
<i>it's really hard to do custom.</i>

30:00.799 --> 30:03.033
- Can I have a cigarette?
- Oh, my God.

30:03.101 --> 30:04.802
- Oh, God.
- What's wrong?

30:06.904 --> 30:08.939
- She's such a diva.
- What's happening?

30:08.941 --> 30:10.440
- I cannot work with this.
- What she say?

30:10.442 --> 30:13.311
She made you cry?
- She doesn't like anything?

30:15.046 --> 30:16.380
- Yeah, so then you just
have to keep that.

30:16.447 --> 30:18.081
You know what,
keep that strength.

30:18.083 --> 30:20.851
Keep that fire.

30:20.853 --> 30:23.020
You all smoke?
Since when is smoking back?

30:23.022 --> 30:24.522
- Do you?
- Smoking's a thing now?

30:24.589 --> 30:25.723
No, I don't smoke!
- Okay.

30:25.790 --> 30:26.890
- You don't look like you smoke!

30:26.958 --> 30:27.992
- That's a good thing.

30:28.059 --> 30:29.593
- You don't look like you smoke!

30:29.660 --> 30:32.596
You will, though, in ten years,
if you keep doing it!

30:32.663 --> 30:34.998
- Wendy.
- Are you okay, Wendy?

30:35.000 --> 30:36.333
- I'm fine.
- Made the girl cry twice?

30:36.335 --> 30:38.101
- No, she just started
crying on her own.

30:38.103 --> 30:40.270
I didn't give my opinion
of the dress.

30:40.338 --> 30:42.438
- I thought that you, like,
went in on her...

30:42.507 --> 30:43.873
- No!
- And that's why she's upset.

30:43.875 --> 30:45.509
- When we had last left
our conversation,

30:45.511 --> 30:48.111
I said, you know,
I want something sexy.

30:48.113 --> 30:50.213
I just got new boobies.
I want something--and so,

30:50.281 --> 30:53.283
when I saw the outfit,
I was just, like--

30:53.351 --> 30:55.219
- That's why she crying.
- No, I didn't say anything.

30:55.286 --> 30:57.088
- Your expression!
- It was on your face?

30:57.154 --> 30:58.755
- You can't stay a puddle.
I'm just telling you.

30:58.823 --> 31:00.757
It's from personal experience.
You gotta just find it.

31:00.825 --> 31:01.825
- Like, I--
- And you gotta go.

31:01.892 --> 31:03.160
- Yeah, I will do it.
- Yeah.

31:03.162 --> 31:04.094
- Just need some time.
I'm sorry.

31:04.096 --> 31:05.528
- All right, get air.

31:05.596 --> 31:07.264
- It's, like, getting down
to the wire,

31:07.266 --> 31:09.299
so I think she's just emotional
from that, really.

31:11.302 --> 31:13.303
All right, everybody,
time is up.

I gonna finish the pants.

Do you need help?

31:36.161 --> 31:37.861
Maybe I can give you an advice.

31:37.928 --> 31:40.797

32:07.959 --> 32:09.293
<i>It's very intense.</i>

32:09.360 --> 32:11.628
It reminds me of when I was
in school in Antwerp,

32:11.630 --> 32:15.699
<i>and I just spend
all my time for studying.</i>

32:15.766 --> 32:19.369
<i>I lost myself,

32:19.371 --> 32:22.071
Luckily, in school,
we had psychotherapy,

32:22.140 --> 32:25.442
and I was able to recover

32:25.510 --> 32:27.644
and to be able
to continue to work.

46:16.206 --> 46:17.340
<i>with that femininity.</i>

46:17.407 --> 46:19.675
Really,
a dress fit for a countess.

46:19.743 --> 46:21.344
What can I say?
- Aww, thank you.

46:21.411 --> 46:24.080
- I think that you couldn't
have presented her body better.

46:24.082 --> 46:25.815
- Yeah.
- So, job well done, Shantall.

46:25.882 --> 46:27.349
Very impressive.

46:27.417 --> 46:29.219
- This is probably one
of my highest scores ever.

46:29.286 --> 46:33.088
There is
a real understanding of women

46:33.156 --> 46:37.360
I find in your work
that is so rare.

46:37.427 --> 46:41.163
And you were designing today
for a very strong woman,

46:41.231 --> 46:42.865
and it was
a perfect combination.

46:42.867 --> 46:44.100
- Thank you.

46:44.102 --> 46:45.968
- And I think
great job to both of you.

46:46.036 --> 46:48.404
- I love him.
- No, I love him too.

46:48.472 --> 46:50.874
- Thank you so much,
Shantall and Luann.

46:50.940 --> 46:52.374
All right, Coral and Leah.

46:52.442 --> 46:55.444
- I tend to dress and, like,
to shock people.

46:55.446 --> 46:57.247
But I said this time
I want to shock people

46:57.314 --> 47:00.449
by wearing something that they
wouldn't expect me to wear.

47:00.517 --> 47:03.520
- I have to say you looked
very feminine.

47:03.587 --> 47:05.454
You surprised me.
- Great.

47:05.456 --> 47:07.489
- But I think the fabric
that's overlayed

47:07.491 --> 47:10.127
on the dress--there's something
a little hippy about it...

47:10.193 --> 47:12.194
- Yeah.
- Which I think is very you...

47:12.262 --> 47:14.898
- Yeah.
- And connected with me.

47:14.964 --> 47:16.665
So, I really liked that.
- Cool.

47:16.733 --> 47:18.134
- While I think the construction

47:18.136 --> 47:20.669
is really beautiful,
just for me,

47:20.737 --> 47:25.074
the color, which was so similar
to Leah's complexion,

47:25.141 --> 47:27.410
I worry, on TV,
would wash her out.

47:28.978 --> 47:32.281
- I do have to agree,
in terms of the color.

47:32.349 --> 47:35.418
She does look
very monochromatic.

47:35.485 --> 47:38.687
Was there a reason that
you went with this color nude?

47:38.755 --> 47:41.824
- I thought it would look good
because she's blond.

47:41.892 --> 47:43.092
- I completely agree.

47:43.159 --> 47:45.294
I think it felt fashion-forward.

47:45.362 --> 47:47.363
I live for
a monochromatic moment,

47:47.430 --> 47:50.833
and there's something
commanding about this look

47:50.835 --> 47:52.469
that I really appreciate.
Both: Thank you.

47:52.535 --> 47:53.769
- Thank you so much.

47:53.771 --> 47:58.641
- Luann and Leah, you rocked
the runway tonight, ladies.

47:58.708 --> 47:59.842
- Thank you.

47:59.910 --> 48:02.311
- You both may leave the runway.

48:02.313 --> 48:04.613
- Great job.
- Thank you.

48:04.681 --> 48:08.951
- Next up, let's bring out
Gina and Shannon from the O.C.

48:14.324 --> 48:16.458
Hi, ladies.
- Hi.

48:16.526 --> 48:19.027
- Bones and Shannon,
why don't we start with you?

48:19.096 --> 48:22.131
- I said I want something
that's classic and timeless,

48:22.199 --> 48:25.534
and to not have it really
much further above the knee.

48:25.602 --> 48:27.604
- I feel like we were
a great partnership.

48:27.671 --> 48:28.972
Like, I love her to death,

48:29.038 --> 48:30.473
and I hope she would
have me back again.

48:30.475 --> 48:31.474
- Absolutely.

48:31.541 --> 48:34.376
- With all due, she ain't
the easiest client either.

48:34.378 --> 48:36.879
- Andy Cohen!

48:36.946 --> 48:38.480
- Stirring the pot.

48:38.548 --> 48:40.015
- She's the Grand Dame of O.C.,
so don't get it twisted.

48:40.083 --> 48:41.817
- Ooh!
- Pa-bam! Yes.

48:41.885 --> 48:43.086
- Shots fired!

48:43.153 --> 48:45.355
- Bones, Shannon,
I liked it a lot.

48:45.422 --> 48:49.291
Is it hand-tacked altogether,
or is it from the machine?

48:49.293 --> 48:51.494
- Things like the seams
are sewn with the machine,

48:51.562 --> 48:52.895
and the darts are hand-tacked.

48:52.963 --> 48:54.231
- And there's a draping
on the hip?

48:54.297 --> 48:56.098
- Yes, draping is on the hip.

48:56.166 --> 48:58.334
- The dress looks like you,
which I love.

48:58.401 --> 48:59.435
- Right.

48:59.437 --> 49:01.203
- And it's also refreshing
to see you in black,

49:01.205 --> 49:03.439
because I don't recall
seeing you in black.

49:03.441 --> 49:04.773
- I just feel like
it's slimming.

49:04.775 --> 49:06.443
And I love that I wore
my hair up today, too,

49:06.509 --> 49:08.110
because I never wear my hair up.

49:08.112 --> 49:09.712
- Me too.
I love your hair like that.

49:09.779 --> 49:12.315
- Shannon, you look fabulous.

49:12.382 --> 49:13.315
- Thank you.

49:13.317 --> 49:17.152
- The feathers,
the transparency, fling,

49:17.220 --> 49:20.789
also with a ruching
on the side. You delivered.

49:20.857 --> 49:22.324
- Thank you so much.

49:22.392 --> 49:25.093
- Bones and Miss Shannon,
thank you so much.

49:25.162 --> 49:27.964
- Thank you.
- All right, Anna and Gina.

49:28.031 --> 49:29.598
- I like a high neckline.

49:29.666 --> 49:33.402
I don't mind showing my body
and my figure,

49:33.470 --> 49:35.204
but I don't like showing skin.

49:35.271 --> 49:37.339
So, I feel like she did hear
all of these things

49:37.407 --> 49:38.975
and did all of these things.

49:39.043 --> 49:42.077
- I mean, I like the drama
of the shoulders for a reunion.

49:42.145 --> 49:43.812
- Mm-hmm.
- You're making a statement.

49:43.880 --> 49:47.483
It just didn't seem like
whatever my idea is of you.

49:47.485 --> 49:48.617
- Yeah.

49:48.685 --> 49:51.353
- Anna, how do you
feel about her look?

49:51.355 --> 49:55.292
- I like it. I'm so happy
to see her in this look.

49:55.358 --> 49:57.226
I feel she's very gorgeous.

49:57.293 --> 50:02.431
- I think it feels poorly-made
on the top.

50:03.900 --> 50:05.901
And I got the feeling, Gina,

50:05.903 --> 50:09.239
<i>that you had a hard time
walking down the runway.</i>

50:09.305 --> 50:11.708
- Yeah, before anything,
I have to say,

50:11.775 --> 50:13.375
walking slowly was my idea.

50:13.443 --> 50:15.578
I suggested to walk
a little bit slowly.

50:15.645 --> 50:18.515
But I would like--the skirt
is comfortable to walk.

50:18.581 --> 50:20.583
- This was not my highest
score, I have to say.

50:20.650 --> 50:22.919
It's hard for me.
It just felt a little more,

50:22.986 --> 50:26.622
I guess, gothic
than I would expect.

50:26.624 --> 50:29.258
- It's interesting because
Andy's saying,

50:29.325 --> 50:31.260
"Gina, I don't recognize you,"

50:31.327 --> 50:33.596
and I think the three of us
are saying, Anna,

50:33.663 --> 50:35.297
we don't recognize you.

50:35.299 --> 50:37.467
I am definitely confused.

50:37.534 --> 50:39.268
Second week in a row with you.
I'm confused.

50:39.335 --> 50:40.636
We got a lot to process.

50:40.704 --> 50:42.405
- I think it's 'cause
she thought it was me,

50:42.472 --> 50:44.606
and she thought
she was making me happy.

50:44.674 --> 50:46.943
And I thought it was her, and I
thought I was making her happy.

50:47.010 --> 50:48.344
- Lord.

50:48.346 --> 50:49.845
- We've all had
relationships like that.

50:49.913 --> 50:51.280
- Yeah.
- Yes.

50:51.347 --> 50:54.483
- But with collaboration,
communication is key.

50:54.485 --> 50:55.350
- Yeah.

50:55.418 --> 50:57.253
- I think we've heard
enough, ladies.

50:57.320 --> 50:59.122
- Anna and Gina,
thank you very much.

50:59.188 --> 51:00.622
Both: Thank you.

51:00.690 --> 51:01.690
- Gina and Miss Shannon,

51:01.758 --> 51:04.226
you both brought amazing energy
to this runway.

51:04.228 --> 51:05.628
- Thank you.

51:05.695 --> 51:08.363
- You can take a bow,
and you may leave the runway.

51:08.431 --> 51:10.033
- Thank you, thank you.
- Thank you, Anna.

51:10.100 --> 51:11.700
- Thank you.

51:11.768 --> 51:14.737
- Let's talk to the designers
who had the ladies of Potomac.

51:18.108 --> 51:19.975
- Whoo!

51:19.977 --> 51:21.643
- Wow.

51:21.711 --> 51:24.980
- Dr. Wendy and Kristina,
why don't we start with you?

51:25.048 --> 51:26.182
- All right.

51:26.249 --> 51:28.451
- Dr. Wendy,
what did you ask for?

51:28.518 --> 51:31.654
- I wanted something
that accentuated my boobies,

51:31.721 --> 51:33.390
'cause they're brand new.

51:33.456 --> 51:36.725
They're named Happy and Ness,
'cause happiness.

51:36.793 --> 51:39.061
- Happy and Ness.
Okay, I'm taking notes.

51:39.129 --> 51:42.198
- Are you happy
with how they're showcased?

51:42.265 --> 51:44.400
- Yes, I am. I am.

51:44.402 --> 51:47.069
- Can you--just turn around.
- Sure.

51:47.136 --> 51:50.072
- So, the scarf is hanging
decoratively?

51:50.074 --> 51:51.673
Or you've stitched it?

51:51.741 --> 51:53.276
- I stitched it.
- And then the bustier,

51:53.343 --> 51:54.743
does it have boning
or no boning?

51:54.811 --> 51:55.878
- It's boning.
- Boning.

51:55.945 --> 52:00.349
- I think this was not the most
modern choice of fabric.

52:00.417 --> 52:05.822
I think the metallic
with the hot pink felt dated.

52:05.889 --> 52:08.757
<i>But because of
your confidence, I was like,</i>

52:08.825 --> 52:11.428
is this the most amazing thing
I've ever seen? You know?

52:11.494 --> 52:14.563
- Wendy, you're used
to being in control.

52:14.565 --> 52:17.333
How was it collaborating
with your designer?

52:17.400 --> 52:21.637
- Different. Because I know
that it's a competition,

52:21.704 --> 52:24.306
I didn't want to say what,
necessarily, I wanted,

52:24.308 --> 52:26.508
and that's not her strong suit,
so to speak.

52:26.576 --> 52:29.177
So, I wanted her to showcase
she she's talented in.

52:29.179 --> 52:31.214
So it's more so of a compromise.

52:31.280 --> 52:32.681
- So, how-how much of this

52:32.683 --> 52:34.384
look would you say
is your aesthetic?

52:34.450 --> 52:37.052
- This was compromise.
- Dr. Wendy?

52:37.120 --> 52:39.788
- I'll give it maybe,
like, 95-5.

52:39.790 --> 52:41.123
- More hers than yours.

52:41.125 --> 52:42.458
- Really?
- Yeah. It's more so hers.

52:42.460 --> 52:44.527
- So, how would you describe
your aesthetic?

52:44.594 --> 52:46.795
- I would wear a gown
to the reunion.

52:46.863 --> 52:50.667
- So, you didn't want pants.
- I wouldn't wear pants.

52:50.733 --> 52:54.203
- Did she tell you that
she would prefer a gown?

52:54.205 --> 52:55.605
No.
- And I asked her, like,

52:55.672 --> 52:58.374
what do you think about
the suiting, and she said...

52:59.809 --> 53:02.545
"If you can make one."
You know?

53:03.747 --> 53:05.248
- Do you have
a different recollection

53:05.314 --> 53:07.416
of that conversation?
- Yes. But it's okay.

53:07.483 --> 53:09.151
- Kristina,
you know we think you're

53:09.153 --> 53:11.888
such a talented designer.
It is difficult to collaborate.

53:11.955 --> 53:14.756
It's really always a good idea
to get full consent

53:14.824 --> 53:16.759
about what you're thinking
before you proceed.

53:16.761 --> 53:18.160
- I agree.

53:18.228 --> 53:20.196
- Thank you, Kristina
and Dr. Wendy.

53:26.770 --> 53:29.105
- All right, Aaron and Gizelle.
- Yes.

53:29.172 --> 53:30.706
- Tell us what you asked for.

53:30.774 --> 53:32.709
- I said I want to be
the Black Suntan Barbie.

53:32.775 --> 53:35.243
- Done.
- I want a pop of color.

53:35.245 --> 53:38.181
I want to be snatched.
He killed it.

53:38.248 --> 53:40.183
- Gizelle, how do you feel
in the outfit?

53:40.250 --> 53:42.918
- I feel I can sit down
at the reunion

53:42.986 --> 53:45.787
and cuss a bitch out.
I feel like all that.

53:45.855 --> 53:47.657
- I'm so curious to know

53:47.724 --> 53:49.458
what the Grand Dame
thinks of Gizelle's look.

53:49.525 --> 53:52.128
- Andy, you are
stirring the pot!

53:52.963 --> 53:54.396
- I give honest statements

53:54.398 --> 53:55.798
about Gizelle's lack of fashion.

53:55.865 --> 53:57.599
- You know what, Karen--

53:57.601 --> 53:59.435
- However, this is the best
I've ever seen this woman look.

53:59.502 --> 54:00.869
- Really?
- Okay?

54:00.871 --> 54:02.905
- Wow. Very good.

54:02.907 --> 54:08.010
- On color alone,
it just was above the rest.

54:08.012 --> 54:12.148
You do look snatched.
And you do look like a Barbie.

54:12.215 --> 54:16.685
And if you want to have the
spotlight, this is it, baby.

54:16.753 --> 54:21.056
You played a very smart card,
and that is color.

54:21.058 --> 54:25.227
- Honestly, it was really about
giving her that moment.

54:25.229 --> 54:27.562
<i>Looking through your look
book, everything I saw,</i>

54:27.630 --> 54:30.232
she never wore pink,
and she had bright pink lips.

54:30.300 --> 54:31.834
- Yeah.
- And I was like, okay.

54:31.901 --> 54:33.568
This color will work on her.

54:33.636 --> 54:36.038
- Well done, Aaron.
- Thank you.

54:36.040 --> 54:39.576
- I loved the drama
of that elongated sleeve,

54:39.642 --> 54:41.710
<i>and how you were working it
on the runway.</i>

54:41.778 --> 54:45.047
- I actually asked for two,
like, long sleeves,

54:45.114 --> 54:47.716
and Aaron of course
stepped in with his creativity

54:47.784 --> 54:49.718
and was like, "No, it's better
if it's just one."

54:49.786 --> 54:51.287
And he was right.
- I think you were right.

54:51.355 --> 54:52.387
Absolutely.
- Yeah.

54:52.455 --> 54:53.489
- Gizelle and Aaron,

54:53.556 --> 54:56.591
you seem to be a really
good designer-client duo,

54:56.659 --> 54:58.528
because you're advocating
for him.

54:58.594 --> 55:00.396
So, it seems like
it's gone really well.

55:00.463 --> 55:02.532
- This man will go with me
wherever I go.

55:02.598 --> 55:03.466
I mean, he's amazing.
- Ooh!

55:03.533 --> 55:05.501
- Thank you, Aaron.
Thank you, Gizelle.

55:05.568 --> 55:06.735
Both: Thank you.

55:06.737 --> 55:09.872
- Chasity and Karen,
the Grande Dame.

55:09.939 --> 55:11.374
- Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

55:11.440 --> 55:12.608
- There's good vibes here.

55:12.610 --> 55:14.409
- What I loved about her

55:14.477 --> 55:16.678
was she was willing
to listen to me.

55:16.746 --> 55:19.748
However, she poured herself
into this as well.

55:19.816 --> 55:21.416
- When you look at this dress,

55:21.484 --> 55:24.219
it really accentuates
your great hourglass figure.

55:24.287 --> 55:25.754
- Thank you.

55:25.822 --> 55:27.256
- We don't see you
in black very much.

55:27.324 --> 55:29.392
- No.
- And I love that.

55:29.458 --> 55:30.693
- Thank you.

55:30.760 --> 55:33.161
- Chasity, listen,
I love the silhouette.

55:33.163 --> 55:37.100
I have seen this dress before.

55:37.166 --> 55:40.969
I understand, Karen, that
you usually don't wear black.

55:41.037 --> 55:42.371
- Right.

55:42.438 --> 55:45.207
- And probably because
you like to stand out.

55:45.275 --> 55:47.843
- I said, if you're gonna put
me in black, pour me into it.

55:47.910 --> 55:49.144
Mold me into it.

55:49.212 --> 55:53.115
So when she took that option,
it came with blessings from me.

55:53.182 --> 55:55.117
- I didn't want to just
give her a color for the sake

55:55.184 --> 55:57.654
of giving her a color,
so, I knew I could do black,

55:57.720 --> 56:00.255
and I could do it well,
so I just went with that,

56:00.323 --> 56:01.723
because I knew
I could execute it.

56:01.791 --> 56:04.459
- I think it just needed
a little extra.

56:04.527 --> 56:06.795
It's a little safe for you.
- Okay.

56:06.863 --> 56:08.731
- I've seen new from you.
This is not new.

56:08.798 --> 56:10.665
- Okay.
- But I think ultimately,

56:10.733 --> 56:12.134
if I turn on the television,

56:12.201 --> 56:14.403
I'm gonna look
at the Grand Dame and be like,

56:14.470 --> 56:15.871
she looks like the Grande Dame.

56:15.873 --> 56:17.005
She looks in charge.
- And she nailed that.

56:17.073 --> 56:18.207
- And I think
that that's important.

56:18.274 --> 56:19.407
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

56:19.409 --> 56:22.944
- Thank you, Chasity.
Thank you, Karen, Grande Dame.

56:23.012 --> 56:25.814
A- Thank you. Thank you.
- Yes. Grande Dame!

56:25.882 --> 56:27.883
- And you ladies
may leave the runway.

56:27.950 --> 56:29.284
- Thank you so much.

56:31.154 --> 56:32.821
- Good job, designers.

56:32.823 --> 56:36.893
Pleasing the Housewives
is really pretty difficult.

56:36.959 --> 56:38.427
- This was not easy.

56:38.429 --> 56:42.564
- I'm impressed.
So, congratulations.

56:42.566 --> 56:45.835
- You all have given us
a lot to talk about.

56:45.902 --> 56:49.972
So, we need to unpack a little
bit and compare notes here.

56:50.039 --> 56:52.974
Thank you so much
for all of your great work.

56:53.042 --> 56:55.911
You may leave the runway.
All: Thank you.

56:58.582 --> 57:00.482
- Hey, y'all!

57:00.484 --> 57:02.517
Y'all are so beautiful.
- Thank you.

57:02.585 --> 57:04.152
- Hi, guys.

57:04.220 --> 57:07.355
[all speaking at once]

57:07.857 --> 57:09.592
- Well, you know,
when we were up there,

57:09.659 --> 57:11.860
I tried to bite my tongue
and be nice.

57:11.928 --> 57:14.262
I didn't tell them everything.
I was trying to--

57:14.330 --> 57:16.598
- I did not too.
- I tried to be

57:16.600 --> 57:18.600
an advocate for you.
- I know. Yeah.

57:18.602 --> 57:20.735
- Overall, I think
that the designers

57:20.803 --> 57:23.271
did a really good job
designing for these Housewives.

57:23.339 --> 57:25.006
- Oh, yeah.

57:25.074 --> 57:27.443
- And overwhelmingly,
they were not only happy,

57:27.511 --> 57:28.811
they looked great.

57:28.878 --> 57:31.413
- I feel like there were
two looks, though,

57:31.480 --> 57:32.815
that were a cut above the rest.

57:32.882 --> 57:35.184
- If I could just talk about
Aaron's look for Gizelle.

57:35.252 --> 57:37.018
<i>It looked beautiful
coming down the runway,</i>

57:37.086 --> 57:39.254
<i>especially
when she turned around.</i>

57:39.256 --> 57:41.090
And she looked perfect in it.

57:42.825 --> 57:45.026
- She looked comfortable.
She looked confident.

57:45.028 --> 57:47.429
<i>The color was spot on for her.</i>

57:47.431 --> 57:49.031
- It floated down the runway.

57:49.098 --> 57:50.699
It felt like a match
made in heaven.

57:50.767 --> 57:53.735
- Why don't we talk about
Shantall and Luann?

57:53.737 --> 57:58.975
- Luann typically gravitates
towards a sequin or 500,

57:59.041 --> 58:03.245
at a reunion, and this really
was a departure for her,

58:03.312 --> 58:06.114
<i>but perfectly in sync
with who she is.</i>

58:06.116 --> 58:08.850
- I think she looked
elegant and modern.

58:08.918 --> 58:10.652
- I don't think she's ever
looked better, honestly.

58:10.720 --> 58:13.054
And she's looked good a lot.
- I completely agree.

58:13.122 --> 58:15.224
- No, okay, you were like--
- Yeah.

58:15.291 --> 58:16.525
- Boom. Boom.
- Yeah, right?

58:16.592 --> 58:17.792
- It was perfect.
- Yeah.

58:17.860 --> 58:20.929
- Okay, so can we all agree
on the winner?

58:20.931 --> 58:22.931
- Absolutely.
- 100%.

58:22.999 --> 58:25.802
- All right.
Who goes home tonight?

58:25.868 --> 58:28.070
- Chasity for me
was a disappoint,

58:28.138 --> 58:33.042
to give me
this very obvious black dress

58:33.109 --> 58:35.744
<i>that I have seen
many renditions of.</i>

58:35.811 --> 58:37.513
I didn't think
it looked expensive.

58:37.581 --> 58:40.015
I think it actually
looked the opposite.

58:40.082 --> 58:43.818
- I don't know her past work,
but Karen was really happy.

58:43.886 --> 58:45.588
- That is true.
And it is all about the client.

58:45.654 --> 58:47.088
- It is all about the client.

58:47.156 --> 58:48.624
And I think the one thing
that I'm thinking about,

58:48.691 --> 58:50.692
when I look back
at unconventional materials,

58:50.760 --> 58:52.160
<i>Chasity gave us very much</i>

58:52.162 --> 58:55.264
<i>the typical unconventional
materials dress.</i>

58:55.331 --> 58:56.698
But then tonight,
she also gave us

58:56.700 --> 58:59.901
the very typical Housewife's
dress that you would think of.

58:59.969 --> 59:04.039
So my question: is there
original thought there?

59:04.041 --> 59:08.643
- All right, guys.
We have to talk about Anna.

59:08.711 --> 59:11.513
- She would be savaged
on Twitter...

59:11.580 --> 59:13.048
- I know.
- From the moment

59:13.116 --> 59:14.983
the cast photo came out.

59:14.985 --> 59:19.121
- The whole vibe of Anna's look
was giving me goth.

59:19.188 --> 59:23.058
- We're looking for glam,
not goth, on the "Housewives."

59:23.126 --> 59:26.194
- We got swept up in it.
It's all right.

59:26.196 --> 59:27.796
We lost the reunion part.

59:27.863 --> 59:31.067
- The reunion is the Super Bowl
for these women.

59:31.133 --> 59:33.935
And I think if you look
at Kristina's look,

59:33.937 --> 59:35.937
<i>there's nothing Super Bowl
about these.</i>

59:35.939 --> 59:37.472
- Speaking of the Super Bowl,
I thought we were gonna have

59:37.474 --> 59:39.775
<i>a Janet Jackson moment
right here on this runway.</i>

59:39.842 --> 59:42.545
- There you go.
Daddy doesn't like a nip slip.

59:42.612 --> 59:45.448
So Happy was about
to make me very sad.

59:45.514 --> 59:47.116
- Yes. True, true, true.

59:47.183 --> 59:49.017
And why the wrap?

59:49.085 --> 59:50.953
- I did not understand the wrap.

59:51.020 --> 59:54.890
Especially for someone that's
going to be sitting down.

59:54.892 --> 59:56.792
What is she gonna do
with that wrap?

59:56.859 --> 59:58.693
- I know Dr. Wendy.

59:58.761 --> 1:00:01.096
That was not
a happy collaboration.

1:00:01.164 --> 1:00:03.498
- There was
a very obvious struggle

1:00:03.566 --> 1:00:05.167
between the two of them.

1:00:05.169 --> 1:00:08.437
But you have to find ways
to quietly

1:00:08.504 --> 1:00:10.172
and poetically inject yourself

1:00:10.239 --> 1:00:11.973
into any look
that you're creating.

1:00:12.041 --> 1:00:14.042
- If she's not happy
with the design

1:00:14.110 --> 1:00:16.244
and if Kristina
didn't listen to her,

1:00:16.246 --> 1:00:18.913
you failed the challenge.

1:00:18.981 --> 1:00:21.117
- I have to say, before we
all make this decision,

1:00:21.183 --> 1:00:24.052
I just want to remind you
that they have,

1:00:24.120 --> 1:00:26.989
in the past,
made some beautiful looks.

1:00:27.056 --> 1:00:29.391
- But the thing about
this competition

1:00:29.458 --> 1:00:33.228
is that it is a competition,
and it is done by challenge.

1:00:33.230 --> 1:00:35.897
And unfortunately,
that's what happens.

1:00:35.899 --> 1:00:38.734
- I think we all know
who's going home tonight.

1:00:38.801 --> 1:00:40.636
Let's get them out here.

1:00:48.010 --> 1:00:51.213
- Aaron and Shantall,

1:00:51.215 --> 1:00:53.014
you had our two favorite
looks of the night,

1:00:53.082 --> 1:00:55.818
and your Housewives
have never looked better.

1:00:55.885 --> 1:00:58.353
- The winning design
was elegant,

1:00:58.421 --> 1:01:00.555
intelligent, and modern.

1:01:00.557 --> 1:01:01.990
The winner is...

1:01:05.829 --> 1:01:09.198
Shantall.
Congratulations.

1:01:10.966 --> 1:01:12.968
- I thought you were gonna win.
- I told you.

1:01:12.970 --> 1:01:14.436
- I thought you were gonna win.

1:01:14.503 --> 1:01:17.572
<i>- Your dress was elegant.
It was sophisticated.</i>

1:01:17.640 --> 1:01:22.143
It was perfect for Luann,
and perfect for a reunion show.

1:01:22.211 --> 1:01:24.512
- That's two in a row, Shantall.

1:01:24.580 --> 1:01:26.181
- I feel honored to be here

1:01:26.248 --> 1:01:29.986
with all these talented
personalities. Thank you.

1:01:30.052 --> 1:01:33.388
- Aaron, we also
loved your look.

1:01:33.456 --> 1:01:35.291
You are in. Congratulations.

1:01:35.357 --> 1:01:36.525
- Thank you.

1:01:36.592 --> 1:01:39.862
- Bones and Coral,
you're also in.

1:01:39.929 --> 1:01:42.064
The four of you
can leave the runway.

1:01:44.667 --> 1:01:47.203
All: [cheering]

1:01:47.269 --> 1:01:48.270
- Oh, my God.

1:01:48.337 --> 1:01:52.240
- This makes me feel very
recognized as a designer.

1:01:52.308 --> 1:01:54.175
<i>Luann is gonna speak
about the dress.</i>

1:01:54.177 --> 1:01:56.211
<i>She's gonna post
in her social media.</i>

1:01:56.278 --> 1:01:58.213
This is not just
about the competition.

1:01:58.280 --> 1:02:00.048
<i>This is about
all the opportunities</i>

1:02:00.116 --> 1:02:01.883
that makes your brand grow.

1:02:01.951 --> 1:02:03.285
- Thank you.
- You're so unique.

1:02:03.287 --> 1:02:04.953
- You did a great job.

1:02:05.021 --> 1:02:07.222
All the credit
really goes to you. You are...

1:02:07.224 --> 1:02:08.690
- Thank you...
- A great designer.

1:02:08.758 --> 1:02:10.292
- For your heart.
- And you deserve it.

1:02:10.294 --> 1:02:12.494
<i>[tense music]</i>

1:02:12.496 --> 1:02:16.032
- Chasity, Kristina, and Anna,

1:02:16.098 --> 1:02:18.133
one of you will
be going home tonight.

1:02:20.703 --> 1:02:21.970
- Chasity.

1:02:23.706 --> 1:02:24.840
You are in.

1:02:26.041 --> 1:02:28.643
However, next challenge,

1:02:28.711 --> 1:02:31.046
we really need you
to push yourself.

1:02:31.048 --> 1:02:33.115
- Okay.
- You can leave the runway.

1:02:33.182 --> 1:02:34.216
- Thank you.

1:02:39.255 --> 1:02:44.025
- It's very painful to see two
of the strongest designers

1:02:44.027 --> 1:02:46.662
in this competition
up here tonight.

1:02:49.732 --> 1:02:54.469
- Kristina, it was obvious your
collaboration did not go well.

1:02:54.471 --> 1:02:57.772
<i>And your scarf
was ill-conceived.</i>

1:02:57.774 --> 1:03:01.077
Anna, your look
was executed poorly,

1:03:01.143 --> 1:03:04.379
<i>and it was not appropriate
for a reunion show.</i>

1:03:06.048 --> 1:03:08.950
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

1:03:08.952 --> 1:03:12.487
<i>♪ ♪</i>

1:03:12.555 --> 1:03:14.055
Anna...

1:03:17.326 --> 1:03:18.293
you are out.

1:03:19.296 --> 1:03:20.662
- Thank you.

1:03:21.865 --> 1:03:23.565
- I am sorry.

1:03:23.632 --> 1:03:24.866
- It's okay.

1:03:26.435 --> 1:03:28.237
- I have been a huge fan.

1:03:28.304 --> 1:03:31.506
I am so sorry.
It's getting very, very close,

1:03:31.574 --> 1:03:36.912
and this is the most painful
part of this competition.

1:03:36.979 --> 1:03:40.515
- I'm really appreciate
the encouragement you--

1:03:40.583 --> 1:03:42.017
All the judges give to me.

1:03:42.084 --> 1:03:45.320
As a designer, this is
the most beautiful thing

1:03:45.388 --> 1:03:47.488
that I can keep
discovering myself.

1:03:47.556 --> 1:03:49.057
- We know that you're gonna do
incredible things

1:03:49.125 --> 1:03:51.526
in your career.
- Thank you very much.

1:03:51.594 --> 1:03:53.195
- Kristina, you are in.

1:03:54.530 --> 1:03:56.798
Thank you both.
You can leave the runway.

1:03:56.866 --> 1:03:58.467
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1:04:01.270 --> 1:04:05.273
It is a little bit
disappointed for myself,

1:04:05.341 --> 1:04:08.810
because I know
I can deliver more.

1:04:08.878 --> 1:04:10.545
I'm out.

1:04:10.547 --> 1:04:15.084
<i>I do feel this competition
discovered some part of myself</i>

1:04:15.150 --> 1:04:17.151
that I didn't know that before.

1:04:17.219 --> 1:04:19.554
I'm so happy
that I get the chance

1:04:19.622 --> 1:04:22.024
to find someone like you guys.

1:04:22.091 --> 1:04:26.895
I'm very happy for being
in this group and being myself.

1:04:26.897 --> 1:04:29.431
- Anna.
- I will miss you, Christian.

1:04:29.433 --> 1:04:31.734
- You are gonna do
unbelievable things.

1:04:31.800 --> 1:04:36.003
You're so talented. You made
stunning, gorgeous clothes.

1:04:36.072 --> 1:04:37.705
- Thank you.
- All right?

1:04:37.707 --> 1:04:38.973
Say goodbye to everybody.
- Yes.

1:04:39.041 --> 1:04:40.508
- I'm gonna send you
to the workroom.

1:04:40.576 --> 1:04:41.843
Clean up your space, okay?

1:04:41.845 --> 1:04:43.244
- Okay.
- Hug?

1:04:43.246 --> 1:04:44.580
- Oh, thank you.
- We can do it.

1:04:44.647 --> 1:04:48.149
We Asian-American,
we always very conservative.

1:04:48.151 --> 1:04:49.250
- Yeah, group hug.

1:04:49.318 --> 1:04:52.988
- We have to pull back
ourself a lot.

1:04:53.055 --> 1:04:55.524
- Shows us that flower!
- Show us a flower.

1:04:55.591 --> 1:04:57.893
[laughter, applause]

1:04:57.961 --> 1:05:00.662
- My design aesthetic
follows my personality.

1:05:00.664 --> 1:05:05.200
<i>And this competition allowed
me to show off myself.</i>

1:05:05.202 --> 1:05:08.503
I'm very excited to see
what I can do in the future.

1:05:11.740 --> 1:05:13.942
<i>- Watch the "Project Runway"
after show right now</i>

1:05:13.944 --> 1:05:17.646
<i>and on demand wherever
you stream "Project Runway."</i>

1:05:17.713 --> 1:05:19.881
<i>On the next "Project Runway."</i>

1:05:19.948 --> 1:05:21.550
Designers, each of you

1:05:21.617 --> 1:05:24.353
is gonna be entering
into a collaboration

1:05:24.420 --> 1:05:26.355
with one of these
up-and-coming stylists.

1:05:26.422 --> 1:05:29.090
You'll create
a runway look inspired

1:05:29.092 --> 1:05:30.692
by the hair style of your model.

1:05:30.760 --> 1:05:32.261
All: Hi.

1:05:32.328 --> 1:05:34.362
- We just about to make magic.
- Yeah. 100%. Black magic.

1:05:34.430 --> 1:05:36.431
- I'm channeling a lot of,
you know, great energy.

1:05:36.498 --> 1:05:39.435
- I love it. Let's bring it.
All: Whoo!

1:05:39.501 --> 1:05:41.235
- Like, I feel like Glenn Close
right now.

1:05:41.303 --> 1:05:42.503
- Why?

1:05:42.571 --> 1:05:44.572
- Because I'm nominated
to be in the top,

1:05:44.640 --> 1:05:45.907
and then I never win.

1:05:45.909 --> 1:05:47.242
What do I need to do?

1:05:47.244 --> 1:05:49.410
- Unfortunately,
it just looks like

1:05:49.478 --> 1:05:51.714
the President of the
Doing Too Damn Much Club.

1:05:51.780 --> 1:05:53.315
- What's underneath,

1:05:53.382 --> 1:05:56.318
with all due love,
and respect, is tragic.
