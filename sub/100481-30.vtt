00:35.020 --> 00:35.980
WELCOME TO THE SHOW!

00:36.020 --> 00:36.980
STILL COMING TO YOU FROM THIS

00:37.020 --> 00:37.980
BLANK VOID, WHICH I DON'T THINK

00:38.020 --> 00:38.980
IS PURGATORY, BUT I CAN'T PROVE

00:39.020 --> 00:40.980
OTHERWISE.

00:41.020 --> 00:41.980
AND WE'RE GOING TO JUMP STRAIGHT

00:42.020 --> 00:43.980
IN WITH OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT,

00:44.020 --> 00:44.980
WHICH UNFORTUNATELY, FOR THE

00:45.020 --> 00:45.980
SECOND WEEK IN A ROW, CONCERNS

00:46.020 --> 00:46.980
THE ELECTION WE JUST HAD.

00:47.020 --> 00:48.980
AND BELIEVE ME, I'M JUST AS

00:49.020 --> 00:49.980
DISAPPOINTED AS YOU ABOUT THAT.

00:50.020 --> 00:51.980
I'D MUCH RATHER SPEND TONIGHT

00:52.020 --> 00:53.980
TALKING ABOUT THIS RARE TURTLE

00:54.020 --> 00:54.980
FOUND IN WEST BENGAL.

00:55.020 --> 00:56.980
LOOK HOW YELLOW IT IS!

00:57.020 --> 00:57.980
IT LOOKS LIKE IT GOT INTO SOME

00:58.020 --> 00:59.760
TROUBLE WITH THE TURTLE MAFIA

01:00.000 --> 01:00.980
AND IS NOW TRYING TO DISGUISE

01:01.020 --> 01:01.980
ITSELF AS A PEANUT M&M.

01:02.020 --> 01:02.980
IT LOOKS LIKE IT WENT TO A

01:03.020 --> 01:04.980
COSTUME PARTY DRESSED AS "THE

01:05.020 --> 01:05.980
LESS HEALTHY PART OF THE EGG."

01:06.020 --> 01:06.980
ACCORDING TO EXPERTS, "THE RARE

01:07.020 --> 01:08.980
COLOR OF THE TURTLE IS

01:09.020 --> 01:09.980
ATTRIBUTED TO THE DEFICIENCY OF

01:10.020 --> 01:10.980
PIGMENT CALLED TYROSINE," BUT

01:11.020 --> 01:11.980
ACCORDING TO ME, YOU CAN GO

01:12.020 --> 01:13.580
AHEAD AND DROP THAT LITTLE

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
FACTOID IN A FILE LABELED "WHO

01:15.000 --> 01:15.960
GIVES A SHIT" BECAUSE LOOK AT

01:16.000 --> 01:16.980
HOW FUCKING YELLOW THAT TURTLE

01:17.020 --> 01:18.980
IS!

01:19.020 --> 01:20.980
WE COULD'VE DONE THIS WHOLE SHOW

01:21.020 --> 01:21.980
ABOUT THIS SHINY, CHEDDAR CHEESE

01:22.020 --> 01:22.980
MISTAKE, BUT INSTEAD, WE HAVE TO

01:23.020 --> 01:25.980
TALK ABOUT THIS ASSHOLE.

01:26.020 --> 01:26.980
BECAUSE IN NORMAL TIMES, THE

01:27.020 --> 01:28.980
LOSER OF A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION

01:29.020 --> 01:29.980
WOULD SIMPLY ACKNOWLEDGE THEY

01:30.020 --> 01:30.980
LOST AND THE COUNTRY WOULD GET

01:31.020 --> 01:31.980
TO MOVE ON.

01:32.020 --> 01:32.980
BUT AS OF OUR TAPING ON

01:33.020 --> 01:34.980
SATURDAY, A FULL WEEK AFTER THE

01:35.020 --> 01:35.980
ELECTION WAS CALLED, TRUMP IS

01:36.020 --> 01:36.980
STILL REFUSING TO CONCEDE THE

01:37.020 --> 01:38.980
ELECTION.

01:39.020 --> 01:40.980
AND WHILE THAT'S NOT REMOTELY

01:41.020 --> 01:44.000
SURPRISING, WHAT HAS BEEN

01:44.000 --> 01:44.960
DISAPPOINTING HAS BEEN THIS

01:45.000 --> 01:45.020
SHIT.

01:45.020 --> 01:46.580
>> SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE

01:47.000 --> 01:47.980
POMPEO SENT SHOCK WAVES WHEN HE

01:48.020 --> 01:48.980
APPEARED TO DISMISS THE ELECTION

01:49.020 --> 01:49.980
RESULTS.

01:50.020 --> 01:51.520
>> THERE WILL BE A SMOOTH

01:52.000 --> 01:52.020
TRANSITION TO A SECOND TRUMP

01:52.020 --> 01:58.000
ADMINISTRATION.

01:58.000 --> 01:58.020
WE ARE READY.

01:58.020 --> 02:00.000
>> John: WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU

02:00.000 --> 02:00.020
TALKING ABOUT, YOU BUSINESS

02:00.020 --> 02:00.980
GRIMACE?

02:01.020 --> 02:01.980
YOU'RE THE SECRETARY OF STATE.

02:02.020 --> 02:03.980
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO FORCEFULLY

02:04.020 --> 02:04.980
DENOUNCE COUPS AND LOOK THE

02:05.020 --> 02:07.000
OTHER WAY IF THE CIA DOES ONE IN

02:07.000 --> 02:07.960
CENTRAL OR SOUTH AMERICA.

02:08.000 --> 02:08.980
THAT'S LITERALLY YOUR WHOLE JOB.

02:09.020 --> 02:10.980
AND WHILE SOME HAVE SUGGESTED

02:11.020 --> 02:14.980
POMPEO WAS JOKING THERE, HE ALSO

02:15.020 --> 02:15.980
HASN'T YET ACKNOWLEDGED THAT

02:16.020 --> 02:16.980
BIDEN IS PRESIDENT-ELECT.

02:17.020 --> 02:18.980
NOR HAVE MOST REPUBLICANS.

02:19.020 --> 02:19.980
MITCH McCONNELL NOT ONLY CLAIMED

02:20.020 --> 02:20.980
TRUMP IS "100% WITHIN HIS

02:21.020 --> 02:21.980
RIGHTS" TO CHALLENGE THE

02:22.020 --> 02:22.980
ELECTION RESULTS, HE WENT ON TO

02:23.020 --> 02:23.980
SAY THIS:

02:24.020 --> 02:24.980
>> LET'S NOT HAVE ANY LECTURES,

02:25.020 --> 02:25.980
NO LECTURES, ABOUT HOW THE

02:26.020 --> 02:27.980
PRESIDENT SHOULD IMMEDIATELY,

02:28.020 --> 02:29.980
CHEERFULLY ACCEPT PRELIMINARY

02:30.020 --> 02:32.980
ELECTION RESULTS FROM THE SAME

02:33.020 --> 02:33.980
CHARACTERS WHO JUST SPENT FOUR

02:34.020 --> 02:34.980
YEARS REFUSING TO ACCEPT THE

02:35.020 --> 02:36.980
VALIDITY OF THE LAST ELECTION.

02:37.020 --> 02:38.980
>> John: OKAY, FIRST: NO ONE

02:39.020 --> 02:39.980
EXPECTED TRUMP TO "IMMEDIATELY,

02:40.020 --> 02:41.980
CHEERFULLY ACCEPT" THE RESULTS.

02:42.020 --> 02:43.980
HE'S INCAPABLE OF CHEERFULLY

02:44.020 --> 02:45.980
ACCEPTING ANYTHING APART FROM

02:46.020 --> 02:47.980
BLOWJOBS, NAZI ENDORSEMENTS, AND

02:48.020 --> 02:48.980
THE OPPORTUNITY TO SCREAM INSIDE

02:49.020 --> 02:49.980
A STRANGER'S TRUCK.

02:50.020 --> 02:52.000
WHOSE TRUCK IS THAT?

02:52.000 --> 02:52.020
I'LL TELL YOU WHO DEFINITELY

02:52.020 --> 02:53.980
DOESN'T CARE: THIS GUY.

02:54.020 --> 02:54.980
IT'S HIS TRUCK NOW.

02:55.020 --> 02:57.980
HONK HONK!

02:58.020 --> 02:59.980
AND SECOND, WHILE THERE WERE

03:00.020 --> 03:00.980
SOME ON THE LEFT IN 2016 WHO

03:01.020 --> 03:02.980
URGED FIGHTING THE RESULTS,

03:03.020 --> 03:04.980
HILLARY FORMALLY CONCEDED THE

03:05.020 --> 03:05.980
DAY AFTER THE ELECTION, AND

03:06.020 --> 03:06.980
OBAMA HAD TRUMP IN THE WHITE

03:07.020 --> 03:08.980
HOUSE THE DAY AFTER THAT.

03:09.020 --> 03:09.980
AND YET, REPUBLICANS ARE TRYING

03:10.020 --> 03:11.980
TO DEFEND THEIR SUPPORT FOR

03:12.020 --> 03:13.980
TRUMP'S INDEFENSIBLE BEHAVIOR,

03:14.020 --> 03:14.980
WITH ONE SENIOR OFFICIAL SAYING,

03:15.020 --> 03:15.980
"WHAT IS THE DOWNSIDE OF

03:16.020 --> 03:16.980
HUMORING HIM FOR THIS LITTLE BIT

03:17.020 --> 03:17.980
OF TIME?"

03:18.020 --> 03:20.980
A QUESTION THAT NEVER ENDS WELL,

03:21.020 --> 03:22.980
WHETHER THE ONES ASKING IT ARE

03:23.020 --> 03:23.980
OVERWORKED PARENTS WHO NEED A

03:24.020 --> 03:26.980
BREAK OR THE WEIMAR REPUBLIC.

03:27.020 --> 03:28.980
SO TONIGHT, LET'S LOOK AT JUST

03:29.020 --> 03:30.980
HOW WEAK TRUMP'S CASE FOR

03:31.020 --> 03:31.980
OVERTURNING THIS ELECTION IS AND

03:32.020 --> 03:32.980
WHAT REAL HARM HUMORING HIM WILL

03:33.020 --> 03:33.980
DO.

03:34.020 --> 03:35.980
AND LET'S START WITH THE CASE

03:36.020 --> 03:36.980
ITSELF, BECAUSE THERE ARE LOTS

03:37.020 --> 03:38.980
OF ACCUSATIONS AND LAWSUITS

03:39.020 --> 03:39.980
FLYING AROUND, AND IF YOU'RE A

03:40.020 --> 03:40.980
CASUAL VIEWER OF RIGHT-WING

03:41.020 --> 03:41.980
MEDIA, YOU MIGHT THINK, "WELL,

03:42.020 --> 03:43.980
THERE MUST BE SOMETHING HERE.

03:44.020 --> 03:45.000
THEY WOULDN'T BE GOING TO ALL

03:45.000 --> 03:45.020
THIS TROUBLE OVER NOTHING."

03:45.020 --> 03:46.980
BUT THE THING IS, THEY ARE.

03:47.020 --> 03:49.980
THIS REALLY IS NOTHING.

03:50.020 --> 03:50.980
AND LET'S START WITH THE

03:51.020 --> 03:51.980
FREQUENTLY MADE CLAIM ABOUT DEAD

03:52.020 --> 03:52.980
VOTERS.

03:53.020 --> 03:54.980
IF YOUR UNCLE IS A NIGHTMARE AND

03:55.020 --> 03:55.980
YOU'RE STILL FRIENDS ON

03:56.020 --> 03:57.940
FACEBOOK, YOU MIGHT'VE SEEN THIS

03:58.000 --> 03:58.980
POST CLAIMING THERE WAS A LIST

03:59.020 --> 03:59.980
OF 14,000 DEAD PEOPLE WHO VOTED

04:00.020 --> 04:01.980
IN MICHIGAN.

04:02.020 --> 04:03.980
BUT WHEN CNN PICKED OUT 50 OF

04:04.020 --> 04:06.980
THOSE NAMES TO DO A SPOT CHECK,

04:07.020 --> 04:07.980
THEY DISCOVERED 37 WERE DEAD AND

04:08.020 --> 04:09.980
HADN'T CAST VOTES, 5 HAD VOTED

04:10.020 --> 04:11.980
BUT WERE STILL ALIVE, AND 8 WERE

04:12.020 --> 04:13.880
ALIVE BUT HADN'T VOTED, MEANING

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
EXACTLY ZERO WERE DEAD PEOPLE

04:17.000 --> 04:17.600
WHO VOTED.

04:18.000 --> 04:18.980
AND YES, THAT IS JUST A SAMPLE,

04:19.020 --> 04:20.980
BUT IF YOU WERE AT AN OREO

04:21.020 --> 04:22.980
FACTORY AND 50 OUT OF 50 OREOS

04:23.020 --> 04:23.980
YOU PICKED OFF THE LINE WERE

04:24.020 --> 04:25.980
JUST TWO RATS SQUISHED AROUND A

04:26.020 --> 04:27.980
USED CONDOM, YOU MIGHT WELL NOT

04:28.020 --> 04:28.980
RISK TRUSTING THE NEXT COOKIE

04:29.020 --> 04:30.220
THAT COMES PAST YOU.

04:31.000 --> 04:31.980
THE CLAIM OF DEAD PEOPLE VOTING

04:32.020 --> 04:33.980
WAS ALSO ADVANCED BY

04:34.020 --> 04:34.980
TUCKER CARLSON, AN '80s

04:35.020 --> 04:36.980
SKI BULLY WHO JUST LOST THE BIG

04:37.020 --> 04:37.980
RACE, AND HE WENT IN BIG ON ONE

04:38.020 --> 04:39.980
EXAMPLE IN PARTICULAR.

04:40.020 --> 04:40.980
>> IN SOME WAYS, IT'S AN

04:41.020 --> 04:41.980
INSPIRING STORY.

04:42.020 --> 04:45.000
THE TRIUMPH OF VOTING OVER

04:45.000 --> 04:45.020
DEATH.

04:45.020 --> 04:46.980
AND NO ONE QUITE EMBODIES THAT

04:47.020 --> 04:48.980
STORY LIKE JAMES BLALOCK OF

04:49.020 --> 04:49.980
COVINGTON, GEORGIA.

04:50.020 --> 04:50.980
MR. BLALOCK WAS A MAILMAN FOR

04:51.020 --> 04:52.760
33 YEARS UNTIL HE PASSED AWAY

04:53.000 --> 04:54.980
IN 2006.

04:55.020 --> 04:57.000
14 YEARS LATER, ACCORDING TO

04:57.000 --> 04:57.960
STATE RECORDS, HE WAS STILL

04:58.000 --> 04:58.980
MAILING THINGS.

04:59.020 --> 05:00.980
JAMES BLALOCK CAST A BALLOT IN

05:01.020 --> 05:01.980
LAST WEEK'S ELECTION.

05:02.020 --> 05:03.980
HOW DID HE DO THAT?

05:04.020 --> 05:04.980
>> John: OOH, THAT'S AN

05:05.020 --> 05:06.980
EXCELLENT QUESTION, YOU WAITER'S

05:07.020 --> 05:07.980
NIGHTMARE.

05:08.020 --> 05:09.980
NOW THAT SEGMENT GOT PICKED UP

05:10.020 --> 05:10.980
AND CIRCULATED BY, AMONG OTHERS,

05:11.020 --> 05:12.460
MATT GAETZ AND THE TRUMP

05:13.000 --> 05:13.980
CAMPAIGN ITSELF.

05:14.020 --> 05:15.980
AND IT DOES MAKE YOU WONDER: HOW

05:16.020 --> 05:17.400
DID THAT DEAD MAN VOTE?

05:18.000 --> 05:18.980
MAYBE HIS WIDOW HAS AN ANSWER.

05:19.020 --> 05:20.980
>> HE DIDN'T VOTE.

05:21.020 --> 05:21.980
>> IT WAS YOU!

05:22.020 --> 05:23.980
>> IT WAS ME.

05:24.020 --> 05:25.940
>> AGNES BLALOCK VOTED USING HER

05:26.000 --> 05:26.020
MARRIED NAME, NEWTON COUNTY

05:26.020 --> 05:27.980
CONFIRMED.

05:28.020 --> 05:28.980
HER VOTER REGISTRATION WAS

05:29.020 --> 05:29.980
SIGNED AS "MRS. JAMES E. BLALOCK

05:30.020 --> 05:30.980
JR."

05:31.020 --> 05:31.980
AND THAT'S EXACTLY HOW SHE

05:32.020 --> 05:33.820
SIGNED HER NAME WHEN SHE VOTED

05:34.000 --> 05:34.980
IN THE NOVEMBER 3RD GENERAL

05:35.020 --> 05:35.980
ELECTION.

05:36.020 --> 05:37.980
>> WHO DID YOU VOTE FOR?

05:38.020 --> 05:39.980
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SHARE THAT.

05:40.020 --> 05:42.000
>> I VOTED FOR THE DEMOCRATS,

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
FOR BIDEN.

05:44.000 --> 05:44.020
>> I SEE.

05:44.020 --> 05:46.000
AND SO --

05:46.000 --> 05:46.020
>> I GUESS I VOTED AGAINST THE

05:46.020 --> 05:47.980
OTHER ONE, REALLY.

05:48.020 --> 05:48.980
>> John: OKAY, SO THE CLAIM WAS

05:49.020 --> 05:49.980
BULLSHIT.

05:50.020 --> 05:51.980
HE DIDN'T VOTE; SHE DID.

05:52.020 --> 05:53.980
AND, BY THE WAY, NOT SO MUCH FOR

05:54.020 --> 05:55.880
BIDEN AS AGAINST THE OTHER ONE,

05:56.000 --> 05:56.980
MEANING THAT THIS 96-YEAR-OLD'S

05:57.020 --> 05:57.980
APPROACH TO THE ELECTION WAS THE

05:58.020 --> 05:58.980
PRETTY MUCH THE SAME AS THAT OF

05:59.020 --> 06:00.520
20-YEAR-OLD PROGRESSIVES.

06:01.000 --> 06:01.020
I WONDER WHAT ELSE DO THEY HAVE

06:01.020 --> 06:01.980
IN COMMON?

06:02.020 --> 06:02.980
DOES SHE ALSO HAVE A COLLECTION

06:03.020 --> 06:04.980
OF DANK MEMES AND SPEND FIVE

06:05.020 --> 06:05.980
HOURS A DAY CALLING BILL DE

06:06.020 --> 06:06.980
BLASIO A BITCH ON TWITTER?

06:07.020 --> 06:08.980
I REALLY HOPE SO.

06:09.020 --> 06:09.980
THEN THERE WERE CLAIMS FROM

06:10.020 --> 06:10.980
NUMEROUS SUPPOSED

06:11.020 --> 06:12.980
WHISTLEBLOWERS.

06:13.020 --> 06:13.980
IN FACT, LINDSEY GRAHAM,

06:14.020 --> 06:14.980
LESLIE JORDAN'S ABSOLUTE WORST

06:15.020 --> 06:16.980
CHARACTER, SENT A LETTER TO THE

06:17.020 --> 06:18.980
DOJ ASKING THEM TO INVESTIGATE

06:19.020 --> 06:19.980
PARTICULAR CLAIMS BY A POSTAL

06:20.020 --> 06:21.980
WORKER IN ERIE, PENNSYLVANIA,

06:22.020 --> 06:26.980
WHO SAID IN AN AFFIDAVIT

06:27.020 --> 06:27.980
THAT POSTMARKS WERE BEING

06:28.020 --> 06:28.980
BACKDATED ON MAIL-IN BALLOTS TO

06:29.020 --> 06:29.980
MAKE IT APPEAR AS THOUGH THEY'D

06:30.020 --> 06:30.980
BEEN COLLECTED ON ELECTION DAY.

06:31.020 --> 06:32.820
UNFORTUNATELY FOR GRAHAM, THAT

06:33.000 --> 06:33.020
MAN LATER RECANTED THOSE CLAIMS

06:33.020 --> 06:34.980
IN THE AFFIDAVIT,

06:35.020 --> 06:35.980
WHEN TALKING TO INVESTIGATORS,

06:36.020 --> 06:37.980
AND WHILE HE'S NOW INSISTING HE

06:38.020 --> 06:38.980
STANDS BY IT, THE REALLY

06:39.020 --> 06:40.980
IMPORTANT THING TO KNOW IS, THE

06:41.020 --> 06:41.980
TOTAL NUMBER OF BALLOTS FROM HIS

06:42.020 --> 06:43.980
POST OFFICE THAT WERE POSTMARKED

06:44.020 --> 06:44.980
NOVEMBER 3RD AND DELIVERED TO

06:45.020 --> 06:46.980
THE BOARD OF ELECTIONS LATER --

06:47.020 --> 06:48.980
SO, THE MAXIMUM NUMBER THAT

06:49.020 --> 06:49.980
COULD HAVE HAD THEIR DATE

06:50.020 --> 06:51.980
CHANGED -- WAS TWO.

06:52.020 --> 06:52.980
WHICH IS, AND THIS IS TRUE, NOT

06:53.020 --> 06:54.980
THE NUMBER OF VOTES JOE BIDEN

06:55.020 --> 06:56.980
WON PENNSYLVANIA BY.

06:57.020 --> 06:57.980
BUT PERHAPS THE STRANGEST

06:58.020 --> 06:59.980
WHISTLEBLOWER ACCUSATION

07:00.020 --> 07:02.000
INVOLVED A POLL WORKER IN

07:02.000 --> 07:02.020
NEVADA, WHO FOX GAVE A PRIMETIME

07:02.020 --> 07:04.980
SLOT TO MAKE HER CLAIMS.

07:05.020 --> 07:06.980
>> I WENT OUT TO GO FOR A WALK

07:07.020 --> 07:09.980
ON MY BREAK AND I PROBABLY HAD A

07:10.020 --> 07:12.980
150-, 175-FOOT STRETCH WHERE I

07:13.020 --> 07:13.980
WAS WALKING.

07:14.020 --> 07:15.980
>> John: SORRY.

07:16.020 --> 07:16.980
I REALLY SHOULD HAVE MENTIONED:

07:17.020 --> 07:17.980
THEY DISGUISED HER IDENTITY

07:18.020 --> 07:18.980
BY MAKING HER SOUND LIKE

07:19.020 --> 07:19.980
MEGAN MULLALLY

07:20.020 --> 07:20.980
UNDERGOING AN EXORCISM.

07:21.020 --> 07:23.980
BUT I'LL LET HER CONTINUE --

07:24.020 --> 07:24.980
BASICALLY, SHE CLAIMS SHE SAW A

07:25.020 --> 07:26.980
BIDEN-HARRIS CAMPAIGN VAN

07:27.020 --> 07:28.000
OUTSIDE THE POLLING PLACE WITH

07:28.000 --> 07:28.020
PEOPLE HANDLING WHITE ENVELOPES.

07:28.020 --> 07:29.980
GO.

07:30.020 --> 07:30.980
>> AS I GOT CLOSER, THE

07:31.020 --> 07:32.980
ENVELOPES WERE BEING TORN OPEN,

07:33.020 --> 07:33.980
THERE WERE TWO MEN -- OR TWO

07:34.020 --> 07:36.980
PEOPLE DROPPING THE ENVELOPES,

07:37.020 --> 07:37.980
AND TWO PEOPLE RIPPING THEM UP

07:38.020 --> 07:39.980
OPEN AND TURNING AND FACING THE

07:40.020 --> 07:40.980
VAN AND DRAWING ON THEM OR

07:41.020 --> 07:43.980
MARKING THEM.

07:44.020 --> 07:44.980
AND AS I WALKED BY, I LOOKED AND

07:45.020 --> 07:46.980
I THOUGHT, "THOSE ARE BALLOTS."

07:47.020 --> 07:48.980
>> John: OKAY, I'M JUST GOING TO

07:49.020 --> 07:49.980
SAY IT: THAT'S EITHER BULLSHIT

07:50.020 --> 07:50.980
OR THE DUMBEST SCHEME OF ALL

07:51.020 --> 07:51.980
TIME.

07:52.020 --> 07:53.980
THE BIDEN-HARRIS CAMPAIGN OPENED

07:54.020 --> 07:54.980
ENVELOPES AND MARKED BALLOTS IN

07:55.020 --> 07:56.980
THE PARKING LOT OF A POLLING

07:57.020 --> 07:57.980
PLACE IN BROAD DAYLIGHT AGAINST

07:58.020 --> 07:58.980
THE SIDE OF A VAN WHICH HAD

07:59.020 --> 08:01.980
THEIR LOGO ON IT.

08:02.020 --> 08:02.980
THAT IS LIKE IF, IN

08:03.020 --> 08:03.980
"OCEAN'S ELEVEN," THEY SHOWED UP

08:04.020 --> 08:04.980
TO THE CASINO IN A GIANT "DANNY

08:05.020 --> 08:05.980
OCEAN ROBBERY SERVICE" VAN AND

08:06.020 --> 08:06.980
SLOWLY PUT ON THEIR DISGUISES IN

08:07.020 --> 08:07.980
THE LOBBY.

08:08.020 --> 08:10.980
IT'S THE PERFECT CRIME!

08:11.020 --> 08:11.980
ALSO, THAT WOMAN HASN'T YET

08:12.020 --> 08:13.980
FILED A FORMAL COMPLAINT.

08:14.020 --> 08:14.980
ACCORDING TO THE NEVADA A.G.'S

08:15.020 --> 08:15.980
OFFICE, ALL THEY'VE RECEIVED IS

08:16.020 --> 08:16.980
A REDACTED AFFIDAVIT THAT

08:17.020 --> 08:17.980
DOESN'T CONTAIN HER NAME,

08:18.020 --> 08:19.980
SIGNATURE, OR CONTACT

08:20.020 --> 08:20.980
INFORMATION, MEANING THEY HAVE

08:21.020 --> 08:22.980
NO WAY TO BEGIN A PROPER

08:23.020 --> 08:25.980
INVESTIGATION.

08:26.020 --> 08:26.980
AND THAT HAS BEEN SOMETHING OF A

08:27.020 --> 08:27.980
PATTERN HERE: THE TRUMP TEAM

08:28.020 --> 08:28.980
MAKING CLAIMS OF WIDESPREAD

08:29.020 --> 08:30.980
FRAUD, PUBLICLY, BUT THERE THEN

08:31.020 --> 08:31.980
BEING A HUGE DROPOFF WHEN IT

08:32.020 --> 08:32.980
COMES TO WHAT THEY ACTUALLY FILE

08:33.020 --> 08:34.980
IN COURT.

08:35.020 --> 08:35.980
IN MICHIGAN, THEY SUBMITTED A

08:36.020 --> 08:37.980
LAWSUIT WITH 234 PAGES OF

08:38.020 --> 08:38.980
AFFIDAVITS FROM POLL WATCHERS,

08:39.020 --> 08:40.980
BUT THOSE WHO ACTUALLY READ THEM

08:41.020 --> 08:41.980
FOUND THAT THEY DO NOT SHOW

08:42.020 --> 08:43.980
PROOF OF WIDESPREAD FRAUD OR

08:44.020 --> 08:44.980
EGREGIOUS MISCONDUCT.

08:45.020 --> 08:45.980
INSTEAD, THEY'RE EITHER

08:46.020 --> 08:47.980
ALLEGATIONS FROM PEOPLE WHO

08:48.020 --> 08:48.980
DON'T SEEM TO FULLY UNDERSTAND

08:49.020 --> 08:49.980
HOW THE VOTE-COUNTING PROCESS

08:50.020 --> 08:51.980
WORKS, SO ARE QUESTIONING PRETTY

08:52.020 --> 08:52.980
COMMONPLACE THINGS, OR THEY ARE

08:53.020 --> 08:54.980
PETTY BULLSHIT LIKE COMPLAINING

08:55.020 --> 08:55.980
PEOPLE INSIDE THE COUNTING ROOM

08:56.020 --> 08:56.980
WERE WEARING "BLACK LIVES

08:57.020 --> 08:57.980
MATTER" SHIRTS OR THAT ELECTION

08:58.020 --> 08:58.980
WORKERS WERE OPENING BALLOTS

08:59.020 --> 09:00.980
WITH DONALD TRUMP VOTES AND

09:01.020 --> 09:01.980
ROLLING THEIR EYES.

09:02.020 --> 09:03.980
NEITHER OF WHICH ARE ILLEGAL!

09:04.020 --> 09:05.980
AND IF IT HELPS HERE, LET ME

09:06.020 --> 09:07.980
JUST HEAD OFF ANY FUTURE TRUMP

09:08.020 --> 09:08.980
CAMPAIGN LAWSUITS: A POLL WORKER

09:09.020 --> 09:09.980
EATING A BANANA IS NOT EVIDENCE

09:10.020 --> 09:10.980
OF VOTER FRAUD.

09:11.020 --> 09:12.520
ONE HUMMING THE CHORUS OF

09:13.000 --> 09:13.980
"UPTOWN GIRL" IS NOT EVIDENCE OF

09:14.020 --> 09:14.980
VOTER FRAUD.

09:15.020 --> 09:17.000
NOW, WEARING A BASEBALL CAP

09:17.000 --> 09:17.020
COULD BE EVIDENCE OF VOTER

09:17.020 --> 09:18.980
FRAUD, BUT ONLY IF THE PERSON

09:19.020 --> 09:19.980
WEARING IT IS PUTTING VALID

09:20.020 --> 09:21.980
VOTES INTO A PAPER SHREDDER.

09:22.020 --> 09:22.980
IF IT'S JUST THE HAT PART, THAT,

09:23.020 --> 09:23.980
AGAIN, IS NOT EVIDENCE OF VOTER

09:24.020 --> 09:25.980
FRAUD.

09:26.020 --> 09:27.980
AND LOOK, I COULD SPEND THE REST

09:28.020 --> 09:28.980
OF THE SHOW DEBUNKING STORIES.

09:29.020 --> 09:30.980
THE PROBLEM IS, IT'S ENDLESS.

09:31.020 --> 09:31.980
THE LATEST CLAIM IS THAT VOTING

09:32.020 --> 09:32.980
MACHINES OR SOFTWARE CHANGED

09:33.020 --> 09:34.980
VOTES, EVEN THOUGH THIS

09:35.020 --> 09:36.980
GOVERNMENT CYBERSECURITY AGENCY

09:37.020 --> 09:37.980
-- CREATED BY AN ACT THAT TRUMP

09:38.020 --> 09:38.980
HIMSELF SIGNED -- RELEASED A

09:39.020 --> 09:40.980
STATEMENT SAYING, "THERE IS NO

09:41.020 --> 09:42.980
EVIDENCE THAT ANY VOTING SYSTEM

09:43.020 --> 09:44.980
DELETED OR LOST VOTES, CHANGED

09:45.020 --> 09:45.980
VOTES, OR WAS IN ANY WAY

09:46.020 --> 09:47.980
COMPROMISED," AND THAT "THE

09:48.020 --> 09:48.980
NOVEMBER 3RD ELECTION WAS THE

09:49.020 --> 09:50.000
MOST SECURE IN AMERICAN

09:50.000 --> 09:50.540
HISTORY."

09:51.000 --> 09:52.980
IN FACT, AS OF THIS TAPING, ONE

09:53.020 --> 09:53.980
OF THE FEW SEEMINGLY LEGITIMATE

09:54.020 --> 09:55.980
CASES AGAINST ANYONE FOR VOTER

09:56.020 --> 09:57.820
FRAUD THIS YEAR HAS BEEN THIS:

09:58.000 --> 09:58.980
>> LUZERNE COUNTY OFFICIALS SAY,

09:59.020 --> 10:00.980
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 30 YEARS,

10:01.020 --> 10:01.980
THERE HAS BEEN A VOTER FRAUD

10:02.020 --> 10:03.980
ARREST.

10:04.020 --> 10:05.980
COUNTY DETECTIVES SAY

10:06.020 --> 10:07.980
ROBERT LYNN OF FORTY FORT SIGNED

10:08.020 --> 10:08.980
HIS DECEASED MOTHER'S NAME ON AN

10:09.020 --> 10:10.980
ABSENTEE BALLOT APPLICATION, AND

10:11.020 --> 10:11.980
THAT'S A CRIME.

10:12.020 --> 10:12.980
LYNN IS A REGISTERED REPUBLICAN.

10:13.020 --> 10:14.980
COURT PAPERWORK SHOWS THE

10:15.020 --> 10:16.980
APPLICATION WAS FLAGGED IN

10:17.020 --> 10:18.980
SEPTEMBER AND ELECTIONS

10:19.020 --> 10:19.980
OFFICIALS REPORTED IT TO COUNTY

10:20.020 --> 10:20.980
DETECTIVES.

10:21.020 --> 10:21.980
>> John: YEAH, THAT'S ONE

10:22.020 --> 10:24.980
PERSON, ALLEGEDLY TRYING TO

10:25.020 --> 10:26.980
STEAL ONE VOTE, THAT WAS FLAGGED

10:27.020 --> 10:27.980
IN SEPTEMBER, AND THE PERSON

10:28.020 --> 10:30.000
INVOLVED WAS A TRUMP SUPPORTER.

10:31.000 --> 10:31.980
AND THIS IS NOT THE MOST

10:32.020 --> 10:32.980
IMPORTANT THING, BUT IT HAPPENED

10:33.020 --> 10:34.980
IN A TOWN CALLED FORTY FORT,

10:35.020 --> 10:35.980
WHICH IS JUST DELIGHTFUL.

10:36.020 --> 10:37.980
JUST SAY THE WORDS "FORTY FORT"

10:38.020 --> 10:38.980
OUT LOUD, RIGHT NOW.

10:39.020 --> 10:40.980
FORTY FORT.

10:41.020 --> 10:42.980
IT FEELS SO GOOD IN THE MOUTH.

10:43.020 --> 10:43.980
NOW, APPARENTLY THE TOWN WAS

10:44.020 --> 10:45.980
NAMED AFTER THE ORIGINAL 40

10:46.020 --> 10:47.980
SETTLERS WHO BUILT A FORT THERE,

10:48.020 --> 10:49.980
BUT I CALL BULLSHIT, BECAUSE I

10:50.020 --> 10:50.980
REFUSE TO BELIEVE THAT THERE

10:51.020 --> 10:52.980
JUST HAPPENED TO BE 40 SETTLERS

10:53.020 --> 10:53.980
WHO NAMED THEIR FORT

10:54.020 --> 10:54.980
"FORTY FORT" WITHOUT BEING FULLY

10:55.020 --> 10:56.980
AWARE OF HOW FUNNY THAT SOUNDS.

10:57.020 --> 10:58.980
HERE'S WHAT I THINK HAPPENED:

10:59.020 --> 10:59.980
THEY BUILT THE FORT, THEN ONE

11:00.020 --> 11:00.980
SETTLER SAID, "WHAT SHOULD WE

11:01.020 --> 11:01.980
CALL THIS PLACE?"

11:02.020 --> 11:02.980
AND ANOTHER SAID, "WHO CARES?

11:03.020 --> 11:04.980
LET'S JUST NAME IT FORTY FORT."

11:05.020 --> 11:05.980
AND EVERYONE JUSTIFIABLY LAUGHED

11:06.020 --> 11:07.980
VERY HARD AND AGREED TO DO JUST

11:08.020 --> 11:08.980
THAT.

11:09.020 --> 11:09.980
THEN ANOTHER SETTLER -- WHO NO

11:10.020 --> 11:11.980
ONE REALLY LIKED -- SAID, "WAIT,

11:12.020 --> 11:12.980
WHAT IF SOMEONE ASKS WHY WE

11:13.020 --> 11:14.980
CALLED IT 'FORTY FORT'?

11:15.020 --> 11:15.980
WE CAN'T JUST SAY WE DID IT

11:16.020 --> 11:17.000
BECAUSE WE THOUGHT IT WAS

11:17.000 --> 11:17.020
FUNNY."

11:17.020 --> 11:17.980
AND EVERYONE QUIETLY MUTTERED,

11:18.020 --> 11:19.980
"OH, MY GOD, EZEKIEL, YOU SUCK

11:20.020 --> 11:20.980
SO MUCH."

11:21.020 --> 11:22.980
SO THEN THEY SAID, "OKAY, IF

11:23.020 --> 11:23.980
ANYONE ASKS, WE CALLED IT FORTY

11:24.020 --> 11:25.000
FORT BECAUSE THERE ARE FORTY OF

11:25.000 --> 11:25.500
US.

11:26.000 --> 11:26.980
I MEAN, THERE AREN'T, BUT WHO'S

11:27.020 --> 11:27.980
GOING TO CALL US OUT ON THAT?

11:28.020 --> 11:28.980
IT'S FUCKING 1770 AND MOST

11:29.020 --> 11:30.980
PEOPLE CAN'T READ."

11:31.020 --> 11:31.980
AND THAT IS HOW FORTY FORT GOT

11:32.020 --> 11:33.980
ITS NAME.

11:34.020 --> 11:34.980
I WILL TAKE THAT STORY TO MY

11:35.020 --> 11:36.980
GRAVEY GRAVE.

11:37.020 --> 11:38.980
AND FOR THE RECORD, I HAVE

11:39.020 --> 11:39.980
EXACTLY AS MUCH EVIDENCE TO BACK

11:40.020 --> 11:41.980
THAT UP AS REPUBLICANS CURRENTLY

11:42.020 --> 11:42.980
DO OF WIDESPREAD VOTER FRAUD IN

11:43.020 --> 11:45.980
THIS ELECTION.

11:46.020 --> 11:46.980
SO THE ALLEGATIONS HERE ARE

11:47.020 --> 11:48.980
COMPLETE NONSENSE.

11:49.020 --> 11:51.000
AND WHO KNOWS WHY REPUBLICANS

11:51.000 --> 11:51.020
ARE ENTERTAINING THIS?

11:51.020 --> 11:51.980
MAYBE IT'S TO DO WITH THE FACT

11:52.020 --> 11:53.980
GEORGIA HAS TWO SENATE RUNOFFS

11:54.020 --> 11:54.980
COMING UP AND THEY WANT TO KEEP

11:55.020 --> 11:55.980
TRUMP HAPPY SO HE'LL HELP RALLY

11:56.020 --> 11:56.980
VOTERS FOR THEM THERE.

11:57.020 --> 11:58.980
MAYBE THEY'RE CURRYING FAVOR

11:59.020 --> 12:00.000
WITH HIM BECAUSE THEY'RE WORRIED

12:00.000 --> 12:00.020
THAT HE'LL BE A POWER BROKER

12:00.020 --> 12:00.980
GOING FORWARD.

12:01.020 --> 12:02.980
I DON'T KNOW.

12:03.020 --> 12:04.980
WHAT I DO KNOW IS THAT THE

12:05.020 --> 12:05.980
ANSWER TO THE QUESTION, "WHAT IS

12:06.020 --> 12:06.980
THE DOWNSIDE OF HUMORING HIM?"

12:07.020 --> 12:08.980
IS "A LOT," BECAUSE THIS

12:09.020 --> 12:09.980
ADMINISTRATION'S REFUSAL TO

12:10.020 --> 12:10.980
ACKNOWLEDGE THE ELECTION'S

12:11.020 --> 12:12.980
OUTCOME MEANS THAT BIDEN IS NOT

12:13.020 --> 12:13.980
GETTING HIGH-LEVEL INTELLIGENCE

12:14.020 --> 12:14.980
REPORTS AND CAN'T ACCESS FUNDS

12:15.020 --> 12:16.980
MEANT TO FACILITATE HIS

12:17.020 --> 12:17.980
TRANSITION.

12:18.020 --> 12:18.980
AND THEN, OF COURSE, THERE IS

12:19.020 --> 12:19.980
THIS.

12:20.020 --> 12:20.980
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ONGOING

12:21.020 --> 12:22.980
REFUSAL TO CONCEDE THE RACE IS

12:23.020 --> 12:24.980
COMPLICATING BIDEN'S PANDEMIC

12:25.020 --> 12:26.980
PLANNING.

12:27.020 --> 12:28.980
UNTIL THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

12:29.020 --> 12:29.980
FORMALLY RECOGNIZES BIDEN AS

12:30.020 --> 12:32.000
PRESIDENT-ELECT, OUTGOING TRUMP

12:33.000 --> 12:33.980
OFFICIALS CAN'T SHARE CRITICAL

12:34.020 --> 12:36.980
COVID VACCINE DISTRIBUTION PLANS

12:37.020 --> 12:38.980
WITH THE INCOMING BIDEN TEAM.

12:39.020 --> 12:39.980
>> John: YEAH.

12:40.020 --> 12:40.980
AND THAT'S NOT GREAT.

12:41.020 --> 12:43.980
WITH CASES SPIKING TO A

12:44.020 --> 12:44.980
TERRIFYING EXTENT, YOU REALLY

12:45.020 --> 12:45.980
WANT THE NEW TEAM HANDLING THE

12:46.020 --> 12:48.980
PANDEMIC TO BE ABLE TO TALK TO

12:49.020 --> 12:49.980
THE OLD TEAM -- EVEN IF, AS I

12:50.020 --> 12:50.980
SUSPECT, THE OLD TEAM'S PLAN WAS

12:51.020 --> 12:53.980
JUST A SINGLE WHITEBOARD IN

12:54.020 --> 12:54.980
JARED'S OFFICE WITH NOTHING ON

12:55.020 --> 12:56.980
IT EXCEPT FOR "DISCOVER CURE?"

12:57.020 --> 12:57.980
CIRCLED FIVE TIMES AND A DRAWING

12:58.020 --> 12:59.980
OF DONALD TRUMP SAYING

13:00.020 --> 13:00.980
"GOOD JOB, NEW SON."

13:01.020 --> 13:02.980
BUT THE DAMAGE OF INDULGING

13:03.020 --> 13:04.980
TRUMP GOES EVEN FURTHER, BECAUSE

13:05.020 --> 13:06.980
IT ALSO PLAYS INTO THE GRIM

13:07.020 --> 13:08.980
FANTASIES OF EMBATTLED TRUMP

13:09.020 --> 13:09.980
SUPPORTERS, SOMETHING EXPRESSED

13:10.020 --> 13:11.980
PERHAPS MOST DRAMATICALLY AND

13:12.020 --> 13:13.940
STUPIDLY BY THE ACTOR JON VOIGHT

13:14.000 --> 13:14.980
IN THIS VIDEO THAT TRUMP HIMSELF

13:15.020 --> 13:17.980
RETWEETED ON WEDNESDAY.

13:18.020 --> 13:20.980
>> MY FELLOW AMERICANS, I STAND

13:21.020 --> 13:22.980
HERE WITH ALL THAT FEEL, AS I

13:23.020 --> 13:26.980
DO, DISGUSTED WITH THIS LIE THAT

13:27.020 --> 13:28.980
BIDEN HAS BEEN CHOSEN, AS IF WE

13:29.020 --> 13:30.980
ALL DON'T KNOW THE TRUTH.

13:31.020 --> 13:32.980
THIS IS NOW OUR GREATEST FIGHT

13:33.020 --> 13:34.980
SINCE THE CIVIL WAR.

13:35.020 --> 13:37.980
THE BATTLE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS

13:38.020 --> 13:38.980
VERSUS SATAN.

13:39.020 --> 13:40.980
YES, SATAN.

13:41.020 --> 13:42.980
LET US FIGHT THIS FIGHT AS IF IT

13:43.020 --> 13:46.980
IS OUR LAST FIGHT ON EARTH.

13:47.020 --> 13:50.980
AS MUHAMMAD ALI SAID, IT'S NOT

13:51.020 --> 13:51.980
OVER TILL THE LAST PUNCH YOU

13:52.020 --> 13:53.980
HAVE.

13:54.020 --> 13:54.980
>> John: OKAY, THERE'S A LOT

13:55.020 --> 13:56.980
THERE, FROM DOUBLING DOWN ON

13:57.020 --> 13:57.980
CALLING THE LEFT SATAN TO SAYING

13:58.020 --> 13:58.980
"I STAND HERE" WHEN HE'S CLEARLY

13:59.020 --> 13:59.980
SITTING, TO THAT MUHAMMAD ALI

14:00.020 --> 14:01.980
QUOTE, WHICH WE COULD NOT FIND

14:02.020 --> 14:06.980
ANY RECORD OF HIM SAYING.

14:07.020 --> 14:08.980
WHICH DOES MAKE SENSE, BECAUSE

14:09.020 --> 14:09.980
IT DOESN'T REALLY SOUND LIKE

14:10.020 --> 14:10.980
MUHAMMAD ALI.

14:11.020 --> 14:11.980
IT DOESN'T HAVE THE RHETORICAL

14:12.020 --> 14:12.980
FLAIR OF "FLOAT LIKE A

14:13.020 --> 14:13.980
BUTTERFLY, STING LIKE A BEE," OR

14:14.020 --> 14:14.980
THE WIT OF "I'M SO MEAN, I MAKE

14:15.020 --> 14:16.980
MEDICINE SICK."

14:17.020 --> 14:17.980
"IT'S NOT OVER TILL THE LAST

14:18.020 --> 14:18.980
PUNCH YOU HAVE" SOUNDS LESS LIKE

14:19.020 --> 14:20.980
MUHAMMAD ALI AND MORE LIKE A

14:21.020 --> 14:21.980
BLURB ON A BOOTLEG VHS COVER OF

14:22.020 --> 14:24.980
"ROCKY IV."

14:25.020 --> 14:26.980
AND SURE, THAT'S A RIDICULOUS

14:27.020 --> 14:27.980
VIDEO, BUT THE FACT IS, A LOT OF

14:28.020 --> 14:30.000
PEOPLE BELIEVE STUFF LIKE THAT.

14:31.000 --> 14:31.980
AND WHEN YOU CONTINUALLY INSIST

14:32.020 --> 14:34.980
THAT THE ELECTION WAS STOLEN IN

14:35.020 --> 14:35.980
BIG CITIES AND SUGGEST THAT

14:36.020 --> 14:37.980
REMEDYING THIS CALLS FOR THE

14:38.020 --> 14:38.980
BIGGEST FIGHT SINCE THE CIVIL

14:39.020 --> 14:40.980
WAR, THINGS START TO GET

14:41.020 --> 14:41.980
DEADLY SERIOUS.

14:42.020 --> 14:43.980
LAST THURSDAY, TWO ARMED MEN

14:44.020 --> 14:44.980
WERE ARRESTED OUTSIDE A

14:45.020 --> 14:45.980
PHILADELPHIA CONVENTION CENTER

14:46.020 --> 14:47.980
AFTER POLICE HAD RECEIVED A TIP

14:48.020 --> 14:49.000
ABOUT A THREAT TO THE

14:49.000 --> 14:49.960
VOTE-COUNTING SITE.

14:50.000 --> 14:50.980
AND ONE OF THE CITY

14:51.020 --> 14:51.980
COMMISSIONERS IN CHARGE OF

14:52.020 --> 14:52.980
BALLOT COUNTING -- A REPUBLICAN,

14:53.020 --> 14:54.980
BY THE WAY -- HAS BEEN

14:55.020 --> 14:56.980
UNDERSTANDABLY RATTLED BY THE

14:57.020 --> 14:58.640
CHAOS ENGULFING HIS OFFICE.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.980
>> FROM THE INSIDE LOOKING OUT,

15:01.020 --> 15:03.980
IT FEELS ALL VERY DERANGED.

15:04.020 --> 15:04.980
IT'S PEOPLE MAKING ACCUSATIONS,

15:05.020 --> 15:07.980
THAT WE WOULDN'T COUNT THOSE

15:08.020 --> 15:12.980
VOTES, OR ADDING FRAUDULENT

15:13.020 --> 15:14.980
VOTES OR JUST COMING UP WITH ALL

15:15.020 --> 15:15.980
SORTS OF CRAZY STUFF.

15:16.020 --> 15:16.980
>> ACCUSATIONS LIKE "YOU ARE

15:17.020 --> 15:18.000
CHEATING."

15:18.000 --> 15:18.500
>> YES.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
>> "YOU ARE MANIPULATING THE

15:20.000 --> 15:20.020
VOTE."

15:20.020 --> 15:21.980
>> YES.

15:22.020 --> 15:23.980
OR CALLS TO OUR OFFICES

15:24.020 --> 15:26.980
REMINDING US THAT THIS IS WHAT

15:27.020 --> 15:29.980
THE SECOND AMENDMENT IS FOR,

15:30.020 --> 15:31.980
PEOPLE LIKE US.

15:32.020 --> 15:34.000
>> YOU'RE GETTING CALLS LIKE

15:34.000 --> 15:34.020
THAT?

15:34.020 --> 15:34.980
>> YES.

15:35.020 --> 15:35.980
>> THAT'S A NOT-SO-VEILED DEATH

15:36.020 --> 15:37.980
THREAT.

15:38.020 --> 15:40.980
>> YES, FOR COUNTING VOTES IN A

15:41.020 --> 15:42.980
DEMOCRACY.

15:43.020 --> 15:45.980
>> John: THAT'S AWFUL.

15:46.020 --> 15:48.000
AND TRUMP IS PLAYING A DANGEROUS

15:48.000 --> 15:48.020
GAME HERE, BECAUSE THERE IS A

15:48.020 --> 15:49.980
HUGE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

15:50.020 --> 15:50.980
"NOT MY PRESIDENT" AND

15:51.020 --> 15:51.980
"NOT THE PRESIDENT."

15:52.020 --> 15:54.980
AND TO BE CLEAR, PEOPLE WHO ARE

15:55.020 --> 15:55.980
THAT ANGRY ARE NOT RILING

15:56.020 --> 15:56.980
THEMSELVES UP IN A VACUUM.

15:57.020 --> 15:59.980
THEY'VE BEEN FED A STEADY DIET

16:00.020 --> 16:00.980
OF MISINFORMATION, BULLSHIT

16:01.020 --> 16:02.980
FRAUD CLAIMS, AND A VICTIM

16:03.020 --> 16:04.980
NARRATIVE FROM OUTLETS LIKE

16:05.020 --> 16:05.980
FOX NEWS, NEWSMAX, OAN, AND MOST

16:06.020 --> 16:07.980
IMPORTANTLY, TRUMP HIMSELF,

16:08.020 --> 16:08.980
WHOSE TWITTER FEED THIS WEEK

16:09.020 --> 16:10.980
OSCILLATED BETWEEN BREITBART

16:11.020 --> 16:12.980
ARTICLES, NONSENSE CLAIMS THAT

16:13.020 --> 16:14.980
HE WON PENNSYLVANIA, AND ONE

16:15.020 --> 16:15.980

16:16.020 --> 16:18.000
YOU MAY KNOW FROM "HAPPY DAYS"

16:19.000 --> 16:19.980
OR FROM "SUPERBABIES: BABY

16:20.020 --> 16:20.980
GENIUSES 2," WHERE HE STARRED

16:21.020 --> 16:21.980
ALONGSIDE NONE OTHER THAN

16:22.020 --> 16:23.980
JON VOIGHT.

16:24.020 --> 16:24.980
I BET THEY HAD A LOT OF FUN ON

16:25.020 --> 16:26.980
SET, BECAUSE I GUARANTEE NO ONE

16:27.020 --> 16:29.000
ELSE DID.

16:30.000 --> 16:30.980
AND INFURIATINGLY, TRUMP HAS

16:31.020 --> 16:32.980
CHOSEN TO SOW ALL THIS CHAOS

16:33.020 --> 16:33.980
AROUND THE ELECTION DESPITE THE

16:34.020 --> 16:35.980
FACT THAT, DEEP DOWN, HE KNOWS

16:36.020 --> 16:36.980
IT'S OVER.

16:37.020 --> 16:37.980
FRIDAY AFTERNOON, THE FINAL

16:38.020 --> 16:40.980
STATES WERE CALLED BY MOST

16:41.020 --> 16:42.980
OUTLETS, PUTTING JOE BIDEN AT

16:43.020 --> 16:43.980
306 ELECTORAL VOTES TO

16:44.020 --> 16:45.980
TRUMP'S 232.

16:46.020 --> 16:48.980
AND DURING A PRESS CONFERENCE

16:49.020 --> 16:49.980
TRUMP HELD A FEW HOURS LATER, HE

16:50.020 --> 16:50.980
NEARLY ACKNOWLEDGED REALITY.

16:51.020 --> 16:52.980
>> IDEALLY, WE WON'T GO TO A

16:53.020 --> 16:53.980
LOCKDOWN.

16:54.020 --> 16:54.980
I WILL NOT GO -- THIS

16:55.020 --> 16:56.980
ADMINISTRATION WILL NOT BE GOING

16:57.020 --> 16:58.980
TO A LOCKDOWN.

16:59.020 --> 16:59.980
HOPEFULLY THE -- THE, UH,

17:00.020 --> 17:01.000
WHATEVER HAPPENS IN THE FUTURE

17:01.000 --> 17:01.020

17:01.020 --> 17:01.980

17:02.020 --> 17:03.980
I GUESS TIME WILL TELL.

17:04.020 --> 17:05.000
BUT I CAN TELL YOU, THIS

17:05.000 --> 17:05.020
ADMINISTRATION WILL NOT GO TO A

17:05.020 --> 17:06.980
LOCKDOWN.

17:07.020 --> 17:08.980
>> John: EXCEPT NO, TIME WILL

17:09.020 --> 17:09.980
NOT TELL.

17:10.020 --> 17:11.980
TIME HAS TOLD.

17:12.020 --> 17:12.980
TRUMP LOST THIS ELECTION, AND HE

17:13.020 --> 17:13.980
KNOWS IT.

17:14.020 --> 17:14.980
AND YET, JUST AN HOUR AFTER THAT

17:15.020 --> 17:15.980
PRESS CONFERENCE, HE WAS

17:16.020 --> 17:17.980
RETWEETING VOTER FRAUD

17:18.020 --> 17:18.980
CONSPIRACIES AGAIN, WHICH IS

17:19.020 --> 17:20.980
PATHETIC, DANGEROUS, AND IN MANY

17:21.020 --> 17:21.980
WAYS, AN APPROPRIATE CODA TO A

17:22.020 --> 17:23.980
PRESIDENCY THAT HAS DESTROYED SO

17:24.020 --> 17:24.980
MANY LIVES -- NOT ONLY OF THOSE

17:25.020 --> 17:26.980
THAT HE'S ATTACKED, BUT ALSO OF

17:27.020 --> 17:27.980
THOSE HE'S CLAIMED TO PROTECT.

17:28.020 --> 17:29.980
SO MANY OF US HAVE LOST LOVED

17:30.020 --> 17:30.980
ONES, EITHER BECAUSE YOU COULD

17:31.020 --> 17:32.980
NO LONGER SQUARE YOUR LOVE FOR

17:33.020 --> 17:34.980
THEM WITH THEIR LOVE FOR HIM OR

17:35.020 --> 17:35.980
BECAUSE THEY FELL DOWN A

17:36.020 --> 17:36.980
MIND-MELTING RABBIT HOLE OF

17:37.020 --> 17:38.980
CONSPIRACY THEORIES THAT HE

17:39.020 --> 17:40.980
HAPPILY PERPETUATED OR BECAUSE

17:41.020 --> 17:42.820
HE LET A DEADLY VIRUS RUN WILD

17:43.000 --> 17:44.980
AND IT FUCKING KILLED THEM!

17:45.020 --> 17:45.980
AND NOW, AS A PARTING GIFT TO

17:46.020 --> 17:46.980
THE COUNTRY, TRUMP IS SOMEHOW

17:47.020 --> 17:48.980
MANAGING TO DIVIDE US EVEN

17:49.020 --> 17:50.880
FURTHER WHILE ALSO HOBBLING HIS

17:51.000 --> 17:52.980
SUCCESSOR AT THE WORST POSSIBLE

17:53.020 --> 17:53.980
TIME, WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY

17:54.020 --> 17:55.980
UNFORGIVABLE.

17:56.020 --> 17:57.980
AND YES, THE FACT TRUMP WON'T BE

17:58.020 --> 17:58.980
PRESIDENT NEXT YEAR IS GOOD.

17:59.020 --> 18:03.000
IT'S REALLY GOOD.

18:03.000 --> 18:03.960
BUT THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO DO,

18:04.000 --> 18:04.980

18:05.020 --> 18:06.000
THINGS ARE GOING TO SUCK FOR A
