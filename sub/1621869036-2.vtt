03:58.800 --> 04:00.560
How long have you been sitting with him?

04:00.840 --> 04:02.960
Most of the night.

04:05.040 --> 04:06.800
Has he said anything?

04:10.840 --> 04:13.000
I gave him the antibiotics.

04:14.040 --> 04:16.440
The equations in his notepad.
I think they're important.

04:16.520 --> 04:20.240
More important than
the lives of the people here?

10:23.240 --> 10:25.720
You follow the river
and see who is there.

10:26.240 --> 10:27.320
He regained consciousness.

10:29.960 --> 10:30.960
Leave us.

10:33.520 --> 10:34.840
Did he say anything?

10:36.600 --> 10:39.520
He said their journey to Earth
took no time at all.

10:40.240 --> 10:41.400
How is that possible?

10:41.480 --> 10:44.480
In the quantum world photons
and electrons can affect each other

10:44.560 --> 10:47.000
even if they're hundreds of miles apart.

10:48.080 --> 10:49.800
It happens in an instant.

10:49.880 --> 10:53.440
There's no travel, no communication,
no time passes.

10:53.520 --> 10:55.360
Can they use this?

10:55.440 --> 10:58.480
I think they can move objects
instantaneously across vast distances.

11:00.200 --> 11:01.840
I think it's how they got here.

11:01.920 --> 11:03.560
Catherine, how does it help us?

11:04.600 --> 11:05.920
I don't know.

11:08.200 --> 11:09.480
I don't know.

11:13.720 --> 11:15.360
He said we could change things.

11:17.200 --> 11:18.520
That it wasn't too late.

11:20.200 --> 11:21.920
If you can manipulate the world
on a quantum level,

11:22.000 --> 11:23.560
then maybe anything is possible.

11:23.920 --> 11:27.240
Yeah, maybe.

11:37.600 --> 11:39.840
I know I shouldn't have
given him the antibiotics.

11:42.400 --> 11:44.520
All I could think about
was getting answers.

11:45.040 --> 11:47.440
That was more important
to me than anything.

11:53.840 --> 11:56.040
How can you love someone
who thinks like that?

11:59.520 --> 12:00.560
It's not easy.

12:03.080 --> 12:04.440
All I can tell you is that I do.

14:44.640 --> 14:45.720
Oh, no.

14:45.800 --> 14:48.280
Check the generator. Can you go?

14:55.040 --> 14:57.000
Stay away from the windows!

15:00.480 --> 15:01.720
What's happening?

15:04.520 --> 15:05.520
Stay away from the windows!

15:07.520 --> 15:08.840
-Theo!
-Catherine, on the ground.

15:11.040 --> 15:12.680
-Theo?
-Sophia, get down!

15:15.240 --> 15:16.800
-Sophia, get down!
-Theo!

15:20.280 --> 15:21.560
On the ground!

15:41.600 --> 15:42.600
Get up!

15:43.040 --> 15:45.520
There's nothing you can do! Leave him!
You have to leave him! Let's go!

16:12.960 --> 16:13.960
Quickly!

16:14.280 --> 16:15.400
Quickly!

16:31.440 --> 16:32.440
Let's go!

16:40.080 --> 16:41.080
Got it.

16:45.080 --> 16:46.200
The service tunnel! Go!

17:10.280 --> 17:11.400
Where's Theo?

17:11.600 --> 17:12.720
He's dead.

17:12.800 --> 17:13.960
Get out of here.

17:14.040 --> 17:15.040
Get out!

17:30.320 --> 17:31.440
Take them away.

17:31.960 --> 17:33.120
Take them away.

17:44.080 --> 17:45.160
Come on.

24:29.600 --> 24:30.680
I think they've gone.

24:35.240 --> 24:37.120
You think it's weird
that they look like us?

24:43.840 --> 24:44.840
What?

24:46.280 --> 24:47.320
Nothing.

24:48.600 --> 24:49.760
Pack up your things.

24:50.120 --> 24:51.320
We're leaving.

28:43.040 --> 28:44.240
I'll check upstairs.

29:13.440 --> 29:15.760
We just leave him up there?
We don't bury him?

29:18.000 --> 29:19.480
It's too dangerous to go back.

29:23.040 --> 29:25.080
If he was here he'd tell us not to go.

29:29.040 --> 29:30.080
I'm sorry.

29:33.280 --> 29:35.720
I'll see if I can find
some wood for a fire.

30:10.800 --> 30:12.680
I promised Theo I'd protect him.

30:17.480 --> 30:19.240
I told him I'd keep him safe.

30:21.480 --> 30:23.560
It's not your fault, okay?

30:25.200 --> 30:27.360
There's nothing you could have done.

34:48.200 --> 34:50.080
You can help me if you like?

34:54.000 --> 34:56.160
What's going to happen
now Jonathan has his family?

34:57.760 --> 34:58.880
What do you mean?

35:01.160 --> 35:02.520
Will he get back with his wife?

35:06.080 --> 35:07.200
I don't know.

35:11.080 --> 35:12.800
Let's just be grateful
that he's found them.

35:15.400 --> 35:16.800
Everything will change now.

37:47.280 --> 37:49.240
I'd like the water
and I'll take your bag as well.

39:44.400 --> 39:45.640
This is the building.

40:03.360 --> 40:04.920
Right, go ahead.

40:05.520 --> 40:06.720
I'll keep watch.

40:17.080 --> 40:19.320
How do we find this Professor Bill Ward?

40:19.760 --> 40:21.280
We have to assume
he's some kind of scientist.

40:21.360 --> 40:22.360
We'll start there.

40:23.160 --> 40:25.120
Look at the reference pages.

40:28.520 --> 40:29.640
What are they?

40:30.120 --> 40:31.160
At the back of the book,

40:31.240 --> 40:33.400
they list all the sources
used for research.

40:37.880 --> 40:39.280
I miss the internet.

43:03.080 --> 43:04.080
What's going on?

43:05.040 --> 43:08.360
Jonathan's daughter, Emily.
She tried to kill someone.
