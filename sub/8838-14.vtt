WEBVTT

01:31.718 --> 01:34.387
COME ON! YOU CAN
STRIKE HIM OUT!
HE CAN'T HIT!

01:34.554 --> 01:36.139
RIGHT OVER
THE PLATE!
COME ON!

01:36.306 --> 01:37.348
OK, YOU CAN GET HIM OUT!

01:37.515 --> 01:39.851
USE YOUR FASTBALL.
HE'LL NEVER HIT IT.

01:48.151 --> 01:51.613
WAY TO GO, WILLIE.
SAVED ANOTHER HOME RUN.

01:51.780 --> 01:53.615
AW, SHUT UP.

01:53.782 --> 01:56.743
COME ON, LAURA!
HIT A HOME RUN!

01:56.910 --> 01:58.912
COME ON, LAURA.
COME ON, LAURA.
YOU CAN DO IT.

01:59.078 --> 02:01.956
WHAT A TOMBOY
YOUR SISTER IS.

02:02.123 --> 02:03.082
WELL, THAT'S LAURA.

02:03.249 --> 02:05.418
COME ON! YOU CAN
STRIKE HER OUT!

02:05.585 --> 02:06.461
BLAST IT
OUT OF HERE!

02:06.628 --> 02:08.630
COME ON!
RIGHT OVER
THE PLATE!

02:11.883 --> 02:13.092
ALL RIGHT, LAURA!

02:13.259 --> 02:14.928
ALL RIGHT!
GO, LAURA, GO!

02:15.094 --> 02:17.388
COME ON! GET IT IN HERE
BEFORE SHE GETS HOME!

02:27.398 --> 02:29.609
THAT WAS
BEAUTIFUL, LAURA,
JUST BEAUTIFUL.

02:29.776 --> 02:30.568
THANKS.

02:30.735 --> 02:32.612
CAN I WALK YOU HOME?

02:32.779 --> 02:35.406
SURE. YOU HAVE TO WALK
BY MY WAY ANYWAY.

02:54.843 --> 02:57.637
LOOK AT THEM FELLAS
MOONING AND SPOONING
OVER MARY.

02:57.804 --> 02:58.805
YEAH. MUSH.

02:58.972 --> 02:59.973
REAL YUCKY.

03:00.139 --> 03:01.432
HOW ABOUT GOING
FROGGING LATER ON?

03:01.599 --> 03:03.601
- SURE. I'LL MEET YOU
AT THE POND.
- ALL RIGHT.

03:07.689 --> 03:09.274
HERE WE GO.
YOU READY?

03:09.440 --> 03:11.317
YEAH,
I'M READY FOR IT.

03:11.484 --> 03:12.527
ALL RIGHT.

03:14.153 --> 03:15.989
THERE.
THAT'S GOT IT.

03:16.155 --> 03:18.658
CHARLES, WHY DID YOU
RENT THE WAGON IF YOU HAVE
TO REBUILD THE WHOLE THING?

03:18.825 --> 03:22.495
WE'RE NOT REBUILDING IT,
CAROLINE. WE'RE JUST TUNING
IT UP TO A FINE PITCH.

03:22.662 --> 03:24.455
IT'S AN IMPORTANT HAUL,
AND WE MEAN TO WIN IT.

03:24.622 --> 03:26.332
RIGHT, PARTNER?

03:26.499 --> 03:28.334
I KNOW YOU HAVE
YOUR HEART SET
ON WINNING, BUT--

03:28.501 --> 03:31.504
DON'T WORRY. WE'RE NOT
GOING TO BE DISAPPOINTED.
IT'S WORTH A TRY.

03:31.671 --> 03:34.007
BESIDES, UNTIL THIS
BUSTED FOOT OF MINE HEALS,

03:34.173 --> 03:36.259
I'D JUST AS SOON BE SITTING
ON A WAGON WRASSLING A TEAM

03:36.426 --> 03:38.845
THAN TRYING TO HOBBLE
BEHIND A PLOW.

03:39.012 --> 03:42.015
JONATHAN, THERE'S
A PADDLE IN THAT BUCKET.

03:42.181 --> 03:45.143
YEAH,
SO THERE IS.

03:45.310 --> 03:47.020
I WAS WONDERING
WHY YOU DON'T USE IT.

03:47.186 --> 03:50.148
WELL, I CAN USE THESE
BETTER. BESIDES,
IF I'M NOT GETTING DIRTY,

03:50.315 --> 03:52.150
I DON'T FEEL LIKE
I'M REALLY WORKING.

03:52.317 --> 03:54.485
IN THAT CASE, THE WAY
YOU LOOK, YOU MUST BE
PLUMB EXHAUSTED.

03:56.821 --> 03:58.197
I WAS JUST THINKING
ABOUT HIS WIFE.

03:58.364 --> 04:00.950
SHE MUST GET EXHAUSTED
TRYING TO GET
THOSE CLOTHES CLEAN.

04:01.117 --> 04:02.785
YOU KNOW, THAT'S
EXACTLY WHAT SHE SAID.

04:04.662 --> 04:07.916
I'LL LEAVE YOU MEN
TO YOUR LABORS. I'VE
GOT A PIE TO LOOK AFTER.

04:08.082 --> 04:09.334
ALL RIGHT, DARLIN'.

04:11.044 --> 04:13.463
CHARLES, ABOUT
THIS FREIGHTING CONTEST,

04:13.630 --> 04:15.715
YOU KNOW ANY MORE ABOUT
THE WAY THEY'RE GOING
TO BE RUNNING IT?

04:15.882 --> 04:17.383
NO MORE THAN I TOLD YOU.

04:17.550 --> 04:19.177
2 TEAMS, 2 WAGONS,
SAME LOAD.

04:19.344 --> 04:22.555
THE FIRST ONE TO MANKATO
GETS THE FREIGHTING
CONTRACT AND TOP MONEY.

04:22.722 --> 04:25.350
TOP MEN, TOP MONEY--
THAT SOUNDS LIKE US,
DON'T IT?

04:25.516 --> 04:27.060
YEAH, IF YOU
GET THE WHEEL
ON THE WAGON.

04:27.226 --> 04:28.311
OK.

04:32.482 --> 04:33.566
HI, PA!

04:33.733 --> 04:35.526
HEY, DARLIN'.
HOW WAS SCHOOL?

04:35.693 --> 04:36.778
GREAT.

04:36.945 --> 04:38.821
HOW ABOUT A KISS
FOR YOUR OLD FRIEND
JONATHAN?

04:38.988 --> 04:42.742
I WARN YOU, MR. GARVEY.
IF YOU GET ANY GREASE ON ME,
MA WILL SKIN YOU ALIVE.

04:42.909 --> 04:44.077
IT'S A DEAL.

04:45.703 --> 04:47.747
PA, CAN I GO FROGGING
AFTER I DO MY CHORES?

04:47.914 --> 04:49.540
I DON'T SEE WHY NOT.
I'D LIKE SOME FROG LEGS.

04:49.707 --> 04:51.334
THEY WOULDN'T
LOOK GOOD ON YOU,
CHARLES.

04:52.669 --> 04:53.920
GO ON. GO ON.

04:54.087 --> 04:55.380
THANKS, PA!

05:01.469 --> 05:02.887
DOGGONE IT!

05:03.054 --> 05:04.847
THEM FROGS
SURE ARE SLIPPERY.

05:05.014 --> 05:08.101
SURE ARE. IT'S
LIKE THEY GOT EYES IN
THE BACK OF THEIR HEADS.

05:08.267 --> 05:09.352
I KNOW.

05:15.191 --> 05:17.860
THERE'S THE GRANDDADDY
OF ALL FROGS.

05:22.073 --> 05:23.157
I'LL GET HIM.

05:44.137 --> 05:46.139
AAH!

05:46.305 --> 05:47.974
HERE! GRAB ON!

05:48.141 --> 05:49.225
OH!

06:26.888 --> 06:29.182
ARE YOU
ALL RIGHT?

06:29.348 --> 06:31.017
YEAH. I'M FINE.

06:31.184 --> 06:33.686
YOU LOOK
KIND OF DIZZY TO ME.

06:33.853 --> 06:36.898
BUMPED YOUR HEAD,
MAYBE, WHEN YOU
FELL IN?

06:37.065 --> 06:39.067
I, UH...

06:39.233 --> 06:40.318
I GOT TO GET HOME.

06:43.488 --> 06:46.657
IT WASN'T MY FAULT
YOU FELL IN!

06:46.824 --> 06:49.035
OH, I TELL YOU,
THIS DARN FOOT OF MINE
IS HURTING SO BAD,

06:49.202 --> 06:51.996
I'LL BE GLAD
JUST TO SIT ON A WAGON
FOR A FEW DAYS.

06:52.163 --> 06:53.539
WHEN ARE YOU
LEAVING, PA?

06:53.706 --> 06:55.750
TOMORROW MORNING,
FIRST LIGHT, DARLIN'.

06:55.917 --> 06:57.627
HOW LONG WILL
YOU AND JONATHAN
BE GONE?

06:57.794 --> 06:59.712
ON THIS FIRST TRIP,
AT LEAST A WEEK.

06:59.879 --> 07:01.589
THAT'S
TOO LONG, PA.

07:01.756 --> 07:04.092
I KNOW IT IS, BUT
IT'S A DAY TO SLEEPY EYE,

07:04.258 --> 07:06.052
3 DAYS TO MANKATO,
AND 3 DAYS BACK.

07:06.219 --> 07:08.513
NO MATTER
HOW YOU COUNT IT,
THAT'S A WEEK.

07:08.679 --> 07:10.181
AND IF YOU
GET THE CONTRACT?

07:12.642 --> 07:14.560
WELL, WE'LL BE ON THE ROAD
A LOT LONGER THAN THAT.

07:16.604 --> 07:18.064
I'LL MISS YOU, PA.

07:18.231 --> 07:20.650
I'LL MISS YOU,
TOO, DARLIN'.

07:20.817 --> 07:23.152
A MAN'S GOT TO DO
WHAT'S BEST FOR HIS FAMILY,
THOUGH, DOESN'T HE?

07:27.740 --> 07:28.950
RIGHT NOW
THIS MAN'S GOT TO PACK.

07:29.117 --> 07:29.867
OH, CHARLES.

07:30.034 --> 07:33.287
NOW, I CAN
DO IT. RELAX.

07:33.454 --> 07:34.997
MA...

07:35.164 --> 07:38.334
I DON'T WANT PA
TO GO AWAY.

07:38.501 --> 07:40.336
NONE OF US DO,
CARRIE,

07:40.503 --> 07:42.421
INCLUDING
YOUR FATHER.

07:42.588 --> 07:46.759
BUT LET'S NOT MAKE IT
ANY HARDER FOR HIM
THAN IT IS, ALL RIGHT?

07:46.926 --> 07:48.928
OH, MY GOSH.

07:49.095 --> 07:49.929
WHAT
HAPPENED TO YOU?

07:50.096 --> 07:50.888
I FELL IN THE POND.

07:51.055 --> 07:52.181
I CAN SEE THAT.

07:52.348 --> 07:54.267
HA HA! LOOK AT YOU.
DID YOU CATCH
ANY FROGS?

07:54.433 --> 07:55.351
WHAT FROGS?

07:55.518 --> 07:57.103
YOU TOLD ME
YOU WERE
GOING FROGGING.

07:57.270 --> 07:59.313
OH! WE DIDN'T
CATCH ANY.

07:59.480 --> 08:00.690
I KNOW WHAT YOU
ARE GOING TO CATCH

08:00.857 --> 08:02.608
IF YOU DON'T
GET OUT OF
THESE WET CLOTHES.

08:02.775 --> 08:04.402
MARY, WILL YOU PUT
SOME HOT WATER ON?

08:04.569 --> 08:06.779
OH, YEAH.

08:06.946 --> 08:08.447
HALF-PINT,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

08:08.614 --> 08:10.950
I'M FINE...
JUST FINE.

08:13.119 --> 08:14.787
YOU'RE GONNA CATCH
YOUR DEATH OF COLD.

08:18.082 --> 08:20.835
THAT SISTER OF YOURS
IS SURE ACTING FUNNY.

08:21.002 --> 08:23.296
YEAH, WELL...
MAYBE SHE
FOUND SOMETHING

08:23.462 --> 08:26.215
A LITTLE MORE
INTERESTING
THAN FROGS.

08:26.382 --> 08:28.176
WHAT'S MORE
INTERESTING THAN...

08:40.396 --> 08:41.689
MARY?

08:41.856 --> 08:44.233
YEAH? HERE.

08:44.400 --> 08:45.902
HOW COME
BOYS ARE ALWAYS
BUZZING AROUND YOU

08:46.068 --> 08:48.571
LIKE FLIES
AROUND A STABLE?

08:48.738 --> 08:50.823
THAT'S AN AWFUL WAY
TO PUT IT.

08:50.990 --> 08:52.033
OK.

08:52.200 --> 08:56.120
HOW ABOUT
LIKE BEES AROUND
A BEAUTIFUL ROSE?

08:56.287 --> 08:58.497
AT LEAST
THAT SOUNDS BETTER.

08:58.664 --> 08:59.749
WELL?

09:01.375 --> 09:04.003
I DON'T KNOW.

09:04.170 --> 09:06.130
BOYS JUST...

09:06.297 --> 09:07.465
THEY JUST
SEEM TO LIKE ME.

09:07.632 --> 09:09.717
I DON'T DO ANYTHING.

09:10.843 --> 09:12.595
THEY SURE DO.

09:12.762 --> 09:14.847
YOU KNOW,
IT'S A FUNNY THING.

09:15.014 --> 09:16.849
THE MORE I SEEM
TO IGNORE A BOY,

09:17.016 --> 09:18.976
THE MORE ATTENTION
HE SEEMS TO PAY ME.

09:20.394 --> 09:22.480
HOW MANY BOYS
HAVE YOU KISSED?

09:22.647 --> 09:24.732
NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

09:24.899 --> 09:27.693
WELL, I KNOW YOU'VE
KISSED AT LEAST
ONE--JOHN JR.--

09:27.860 --> 09:29.362
BECAUSE YOU WERE
ENGAGED TO HIM.

09:34.700 --> 09:35.743
MARY.

09:37.203 --> 09:38.829
WHAT WAS IT LIKE...

09:38.996 --> 09:40.206
KISSING?

09:40.373 --> 09:43.334
I MEAN, WHAT
DID IT FEEL LIKE?

09:43.501 --> 09:44.543
WHAT DO YOU CARE?

09:44.710 --> 09:46.754
I THOUGHT YOU ALWAYS
SAID KISSING WAS YUCKY.

09:48.839 --> 09:50.633
YEAH.

09:50.800 --> 09:51.842
YUCK.

10:30.756 --> 10:32.466
CAN'T SLEEP?

10:32.633 --> 10:34.802
NO.

10:34.969 --> 10:37.847
I GUESS I'M JUST TOO
EXCITED, THAT'S ALL.

10:38.014 --> 10:42.768
CHARLES...
TOMORROW.

10:42.935 --> 10:44.770
WELL?

10:44.937 --> 10:48.190
YOU WILL BE GOING UP
AGAINST PROFESSIONALS.

10:48.357 --> 10:49.900
NOW, IF THE OTHER
FREIGHTERS SHOULD WIN,

10:50.067 --> 10:51.652
I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE
TOO DISAPPOINTED.

10:51.819 --> 10:53.738
OH, COME ON.
I'M NOT GONNA
BE DISAPPOINTED.

10:53.904 --> 10:56.240
DON'T WORRY
ABOUT THAT.

10:56.407 --> 10:58.367
EITHER WE WIN
OR WE DON'T WIN.

11:02.079 --> 11:03.497
- RIGHT?
- RIGHT.

11:05.499 --> 11:07.126
OK.

11:07.293 --> 11:08.794
GO TO SLEEP,
THAT'S IT.

11:11.797 --> 11:13.632
- GOOD NIGHT.
- NIGHT.

11:18.804 --> 11:20.473
CAROLINE, I SURE
HOPE WE WIN.

13:25.139 --> 13:28.809
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING DOWN THERE?

13:28.976 --> 13:30.811
NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

14:12.770 --> 14:13.771
LAURA,
YOU BETTER HURRY.

14:13.938 --> 14:15.105
YOU'RE GOING TO BE
LATE FOR SCHOOL.

14:15.272 --> 14:16.607
WON'T TAKE A MINUTE.

14:16.774 --> 14:17.942
WHAT ABOUT
YOUR HAIR?

14:18.108 --> 14:19.068
WELL, I'VE DECIDED
I NEED A CHANGE.

14:19.235 --> 14:20.736
I'M GOING TO LEAVE IT DOWN.

14:20.903 --> 14:23.239
IT'LL BE THE FIRST TIME
YOU HAVEN'T WORN
BRAIDS TO SCHOOL.

14:23.405 --> 14:25.115
WELL THERE'S ALWAYS
A FIRST TIME, MA.

14:25.282 --> 14:26.575
BESIDES,
I'M GROWING UP.

14:26.742 --> 14:29.078
I THINK I'M GETTING
A LITTLE TOO OLD
FOR BRAIDS.

14:31.497 --> 14:32.790
- MA?
- HMM?

14:32.957 --> 14:35.876
CAN I WEAR
MY GOOD PINAFORE
AND MY SUNDAY RIBBONS?

14:36.043 --> 14:37.586
WHAT'S THE SPECIAL
OCCASION?

14:37.753 --> 14:40.714
OH, NOTHING. I JUST WANT
TO LOOK NICE TODAY.

14:40.881 --> 14:43.842
ALL RIGHT.
BUT BE CAREFUL
NOT TO GET IT DIRTY.

14:44.009 --> 14:45.135
I'LL BE CAREFUL.

14:47.096 --> 14:50.558
MA...DO YOU THINK
I'M PRETTY?

14:50.724 --> 14:52.309
OF COURSE
YOU'RE PRETTY.

14:52.476 --> 14:54.353
PRETTY AS MARY?

14:54.520 --> 14:57.731
MARY IS MARY,
AND YOU ARE YOU.

14:57.898 --> 15:00.651
AND I THINK
YOU'RE BOTH BEAUTIFUL.

15:00.818 --> 15:02.069
THANKS, MA.

15:02.236 --> 15:03.654
NOW HURRY UP,
BEAUTIFUL!

16:02.504 --> 16:04.256
WHAT ON EARTH
ARE YOU DOING?

16:04.423 --> 16:05.758
I'M JUST POLISHING
THE MIRROR.

16:19.563 --> 16:21.273
WHEW.

16:23.984 --> 16:25.110
I GOT IT SNUG HERE.

16:25.277 --> 16:26.320
OK.

16:28.405 --> 16:29.573
THAT OUGHT TO HOLD IT.

16:33.535 --> 16:34.620
HERE WE GO.

16:34.787 --> 16:35.579
ALL SET, MR. PERKINS.

16:35.746 --> 16:36.872
MOVE HER OUT,
MR. INGALLS.

16:37.039 --> 16:39.625
ALL RIGHT. OK, PARTNER.
MANKATO, HERE WE COME.

16:39.792 --> 16:41.835
YEAH. FIRST OUT,
FIRST IN.

16:44.088 --> 16:46.340
YOU'LL BE EATING OUR DUST
BEFORE SUNDOWN!

16:46.507 --> 16:48.342
AND SPITTING
MUD BALLS!

16:55.474 --> 16:56.308
HI, JIMMY.

16:56.475 --> 16:57.184
HI.

16:57.351 --> 16:58.769
- HI.
- HI, JIMMY.

17:06.527 --> 17:08.362
ARE YOU
STILL MAD AT ME?

17:08.529 --> 17:11.365
OF COURSE NOT.
HOW COULD I BE
MAD AT YOU?

17:13.367 --> 17:15.786
NOTICE ANYTHING
DIFFERENT ABOUT ME TODAY?

17:15.953 --> 17:16.995
NOPE.

17:17.162 --> 17:20.165
YOU LOOK LIKE THE SAME OLD
LAURA INGALLS TO ME.

17:20.332 --> 17:22.876
MY HAIR.

17:23.043 --> 17:24.586
YEAH.

17:24.753 --> 17:26.505
YOU BETTER CUT
SOME OF THAT MOP OFF

17:26.672 --> 17:29.133
BEFORE IT GETS
IN YOUR WAY OF PLAYING
BASEBALL AND STUFF.

17:31.093 --> 17:33.387
HI. I'M STARTING
SCHOOL TODAY.

17:33.554 --> 17:34.763
NAME'S
SAMANTHA HIGGINS.

17:34.930 --> 17:36.432
CALL ME SAM
FOR SHORT.

17:36.598 --> 17:37.558
WHAT'S
YOUR NAME, FELLA?

17:37.725 --> 17:38.726
JIMMY HILL.

17:38.892 --> 17:40.894
WANT TO TOSS
A FEW BEFORE
SCHOOL STARTS?

17:41.061 --> 17:42.855
SURE.
COME ON, LAURA.

17:46.817 --> 17:48.861
I CAN'T.

17:49.027 --> 17:50.904
SUIT YOURSELF.

17:51.071 --> 17:51.864
WHERE YOU FROM?

17:52.030 --> 17:53.323
JUST MOVED HERE
FROM MANKATO.

17:53.490 --> 17:54.908
OH, I KNOW
WHERE THAT IS!

17:59.788 --> 18:00.664
RIGHT HERE, SAM!

18:00.831 --> 18:02.082
OK.

18:02.249 --> 18:03.792
OVER HOME PLATE.

18:03.959 --> 18:05.502
ALL RIGHT.

18:05.669 --> 18:06.420
HA HA!

18:06.587 --> 18:07.921
FIRE ME ONE!

18:43.749 --> 18:45.334
GOOD MORNING.

18:45.501 --> 18:47.336
GOOD MORNING,
CHARLES.

18:47.503 --> 18:48.837
WHERE ARE WE?

18:49.004 --> 18:51.256
THE WAY I FIGURE,
WE'RE ABOUT 10 MILES
FROM MANKATO.

18:55.928 --> 18:57.387
AIN'T NOTHING
BACK THERE.

18:57.554 --> 18:59.431
THEY AREN'T GOING
TO CATCH US NOW.

18:59.598 --> 19:01.391
LOOKS LIKE
WE GOT A FREIGHTING
CONTRACT, PARTNER.

19:01.558 --> 19:02.601
YEAH.

19:05.646 --> 19:08.565
CHARLES, LOOK
AT THAT WAGON
DOWN YONDER.

19:19.201 --> 19:19.993
THEY CHEATED US.

19:20.160 --> 19:21.662
THEY CHEATED US.

19:21.829 --> 19:25.332
AH, THEY DIDN'T CHEAT US.
THEY JUST OUTFOXED US,
THAT'S ALL.

19:25.499 --> 19:27.584
I DIDN'T FIGURE
THEY'D PULL A BIG
FREIGHT WAGON LIKE THIS

19:27.751 --> 19:28.961
OFF THE MAIN ROAD.

19:29.127 --> 19:31.463
AH, I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN
THEY'D PROBABLY KNOW

19:31.630 --> 19:35.259
EVERY GOAT TRAIL
AND COW PATH IN THIS
WHOLE TERRITORY.

19:35.425 --> 19:36.635
NOTHING WE CAN DO
ABOUT IT NOW.

19:36.802 --> 19:38.554
JUST SIT BACK
AND ENJOY THE RIDE.

20:27.185 --> 20:28.520
MIND IF I SIT HERE?

20:34.735 --> 20:36.695
WOULD YOU LIKE
SOME OF MY MA'S
APPLE PIE?

20:36.862 --> 20:38.196
WHY ARE YOU OFFERING?

20:38.363 --> 20:40.574
WELL, JUST BEING
SELFISH, REALLY.

20:40.741 --> 20:42.534
YOU SEE,
I'M DOING RESEARCH

20:42.701 --> 20:44.369
ON THIS PAPER
I'M GOING TO WRITE,

20:44.536 --> 20:46.830
TO GET BETTER GRADES
LIKE MARY.

20:46.997 --> 20:48.540
THE FACT IS,
I'VE BEEN BURNING

20:48.707 --> 20:50.876
A LOT OF
THE MIDNIGHT OIL,
LATELY.

20:51.043 --> 20:54.129
ANYWAY,
I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU
SOME QUESTIONS

20:54.296 --> 20:55.547
ON THE SUBJECT.

20:55.714 --> 20:56.798
WHAT'S THE SUBJECT?

20:56.965 --> 20:58.216
GREAT LOVERS
THROUGH THE AGES,

20:58.383 --> 20:59.676
STARTING
WITH ANTHONY
AND CLEOPATRA

20:59.843 --> 21:03.055
AND ENDING UP
WITH LUKE SIMMS
AND NELLIE OLESON.

21:03.221 --> 21:04.473
ME AND LUKE?

21:04.640 --> 21:06.350
WELL,
YOU WERE MARRIED.

21:06.516 --> 21:07.976
FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES.

21:08.143 --> 21:11.355
WELL, THE IMPORTANT
THING IS YOU GOT HIM
TO ASK YOU.

21:11.521 --> 21:14.483
TRUE ENOUGH.
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW?

21:14.650 --> 21:16.610
WELL,
HOW DID YOU, UH...

21:16.777 --> 21:17.903
ATTRACT HIM?

21:18.070 --> 21:19.738
WELL, THAT'S
OBVIOUS, ISN'T IT?

21:19.905 --> 21:21.365
MY NATURAL ATTRIBUTES.

21:21.531 --> 21:22.491
LIKE WHAT?

21:22.658 --> 21:24.993
LIKE MY NATURALLY
CURLY HAIR AND...

21:25.160 --> 21:26.495
MY GOOD LOOKS.

21:26.662 --> 21:29.873
MA SAYS I'M BEAUTIFUL,
BUT I WOULDN'T GO
THAT FAR.

21:30.040 --> 21:31.291
NEITHER WOULD I.

21:31.458 --> 21:32.250
WHAT?

21:32.417 --> 21:33.460
I MEAN...

21:33.627 --> 21:35.921
WELL, ALL MAs
THINK THEIR KIDS
ARE BEAUTIFUL.

21:36.088 --> 21:37.673
AND MY DISPOSITION.

21:37.839 --> 21:39.841
SWEET, UNSPOILED.

21:40.008 --> 21:41.718
THAT'S OBVIOUS.

21:41.885 --> 21:42.970
AND DAINTINESS.

21:43.136 --> 21:45.597
THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT.

21:45.764 --> 21:47.391
I CAN
SEE THAT, TOO.

21:47.557 --> 21:50.811
AND, OF COURSE,
A GOOD FIGURE HELPS.

21:50.978 --> 21:52.062
YEAH.

21:52.229 --> 21:53.689
HEY, LAURA!

21:53.855 --> 21:55.774
WANT TO PLAY BASEBALL?

21:55.941 --> 21:57.150
I CAN'T.

21:58.986 --> 22:00.445
HEY, SAM!
WANT TO PLAY BASEBALL?

22:00.612 --> 22:01.613
YOU BETCHA!
I'M UP FIRST!

22:06.284 --> 22:08.745
NOW, THAT WAS
A SMART THING TO DO.

22:08.912 --> 22:10.872
BOYS DON'T LIKE GIRLS
WHO ARE ALWAYS
RUNNING AROUND

22:11.039 --> 22:14.710
PLAYING BASEBALL
AND ALL THOSE
ROUGH GAMES.

22:14.876 --> 22:17.963
HALF THE TIME,
YOU DON'T EVEN
SMELL LIKE A GIRL.

22:18.130 --> 22:21.091
YOU'RE EITHER SWEATY
OR SMELLING OF FISH.

22:21.258 --> 22:23.301
WELL, I SWEAT A LOT,
AND I FISH A LOT.

22:23.468 --> 22:24.970
WELL, YOU SHOULD
COVER IT UP.

22:25.137 --> 22:27.472
USE A SCENT
THAT'S SEDUCTIVE.

22:27.639 --> 22:28.682
SEDUCTIVE?

22:28.849 --> 22:30.767
SOMETHING
THAT LURES MEN...

22:30.934 --> 22:33.478
LIKE FLIES
TO MOLASSES.

22:33.645 --> 22:34.688
AHA.

22:34.855 --> 22:37.274
WHAT YOU NEED
IS SOME PERFUME.

22:37.441 --> 22:38.692
WELL, MY MA'S
GOT SOME,

22:38.859 --> 22:40.736
BUT IT'S
AWFUL EXPENSIVE.

22:40.902 --> 22:42.362
OF COURSE IT IS.

22:42.529 --> 22:44.740
THE BEST THING FOR YOU
IS TOILET WATER.

22:46.366 --> 22:47.659
NELLIE OLESON!

22:47.826 --> 22:49.578
WHAT A ROTTEN
THING TO SAY!

23:12.684 --> 23:14.728
THERE'S
THE OLD MAIDS NOW.

23:14.895 --> 23:16.354
YOU GUYS
STOP FOR DINNER?

23:16.521 --> 23:17.814
HA HA HA HA!

23:21.068 --> 23:22.235
GIDDYUP.

23:27.282 --> 23:28.617
WHOA.

23:28.784 --> 23:31.036
TOO BAD THEY DIDN'T
GIVE US A BETTER RUN
FOR THEIR MONEY.

23:31.203 --> 23:33.330
GREEN HANDS--
NOT MUCH KNOW-HOW.

23:37.042 --> 23:40.962
YOU KNOW,
WE COULD BE NEIGHBORLY
AND HELP THEM UNLOAD.

23:41.129 --> 23:42.714
- MR. ATKINS.
- YES, SIR?

23:42.881 --> 23:44.091
LET'S OPEN THIS UP
AND HAVE A LOOK.

23:44.257 --> 23:45.467
ALL RIGHT, SIR.

24:13.328 --> 24:14.496
OPEN IT.

24:14.663 --> 24:15.705
YEAH.

24:25.298 --> 24:27.676
LOOKS LIKE YOU TWO MEN
GOT YOURSELVES A CONTRACT.

24:27.843 --> 24:30.220
WHEN YOU GET IT UNLOADED,
COME ON IN THE OFFICE
AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT.

24:32.848 --> 24:35.600
CHARLES...WE WON!

24:35.767 --> 24:38.937
HA HA! WAIT
TILL THE WIVES
HEAR THIS, HUH?!

24:39.104 --> 24:41.690
ALL RIGHT, GIRLS.

24:41.857 --> 24:43.066
HI, BANDIT.

24:43.233 --> 24:45.944
LET ME CALL
YOUR SISTER AGAIN. LAURA!

24:46.111 --> 24:47.320
HURRY UP, NOW!

24:48.947 --> 24:50.866
TELL THEM TO GO AHEAD.
I'LL CATCH UP.

26:01.269 --> 26:03.897
- HI.
- OH, HI, LAURA.

26:04.064 --> 26:05.857
DID YOU SEE SAM HIT
THAT HOME RUN YESTERDAY?

26:06.024 --> 26:07.525
LUCKY HIT.

26:07.692 --> 26:11.196
LUCKY, MY EYE. DIDN'T
YOU SEE HER BEAT OUT
THAT THROW TO HOME?

26:11.363 --> 26:12.405
MM.

26:12.572 --> 26:14.491
SHE'S A REAL HOT
PROSPECT.

26:14.658 --> 26:15.617
FOR WHAT?

26:15.784 --> 26:17.285
FOR THE BASEBALL TEAM.

26:17.452 --> 26:18.495
OH.

26:20.914 --> 26:22.999
WHAT'S THAT SMELL?

26:23.166 --> 26:24.417
YOU NOTICED IT?

26:24.584 --> 26:25.961
NOTICED IT?
I CAN'T HELP IT.

26:26.127 --> 26:27.295
IT STINKS.

26:28.922 --> 26:30.924
OH.

26:31.091 --> 26:32.300
IT SURE DOES.

26:34.886 --> 26:36.554
WONDER WHAT IT CAN BE.

26:36.721 --> 26:38.807
PROBABLY A SKUNK
OR EVEN A DEAD RAT.

26:42.560 --> 26:43.687
PROBABLY RIGHT.

27:38.450 --> 27:39.284
OH, CHARLES!

27:39.451 --> 27:42.912
- OH! OH!
- HA HA HA!

27:43.079 --> 27:45.415
WE WON.

27:45.582 --> 27:46.458
WELL, DON'T YOU
HEAR ME?

27:46.624 --> 27:47.584
WE GOT
THE CONTRACT!

27:47.751 --> 27:49.502
OH, CHARLES,
CONGRATULATIONS.

27:49.669 --> 27:50.545
OH!

27:50.712 --> 27:52.005
OH, I'M SO GLAD
YOU'RE HOME.

27:52.172 --> 27:53.048
I MISSED YOU SO.

27:53.214 --> 27:54.507
OH, IT'S SO GOOD
TO BE HOME.

27:54.674 --> 27:56.926
HEY, BUT NOW WE START.
I MEAN, NOW
THE WORK STARTS.

27:57.093 --> 27:58.845
ALL WE CAME HOME WAS
TO TELL YOU GIRLS
THE GOOD NEWS,

27:59.012 --> 28:01.639
GET A CHANGE OF CLOTHES,
AND A GOOD HOT MEAL.
HOW ARE THE CHILDREN DOING?

28:01.806 --> 28:03.391
- FINE.
- GOOD, GOOD.

28:03.558 --> 28:05.143
EXCEPT LAURA.
I'M A LITTLE BIT
WORRIED ABOUT HER.

28:05.310 --> 28:06.436
SHE HASN'T BEEN
HERSELF LATELY.

28:06.603 --> 28:08.605
- WHAT, IS SHE SICK?
- NO.

28:08.772 --> 28:10.357
LOOK, IF IT'S SCHOOLWORK,
I'LL TALK TO HER ABOUT IT.

28:10.523 --> 28:12.859
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
HER SCHOOLWORK'S
NEVER BEEN BETTER.

28:13.026 --> 28:16.071
IT'S PROBABLY JUST
SPRING FEVER, THEN.
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

28:16.237 --> 28:18.239
I SUPPOSE.

28:18.406 --> 28:20.992
I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE GOT THIS CONTRACT.

28:21.159 --> 28:22.369
WHAT TIME
DO YOU LEAVE?

28:22.535 --> 28:24.788
MORNING, FIRST LIGHT.

28:26.039 --> 28:27.374
WELL, THEN I BETTER
GET YOUR SUPPER.

28:27.540 --> 28:28.666
SOUNDS GOOD.

28:28.833 --> 28:29.918
BE IN IN A MINUTE!

29:02.117 --> 29:05.203
MA, HOW LONG
DO YOU THINK
PA WILL BE GONE?

29:05.370 --> 29:07.580
I DON'T KNOW, MARY.

29:07.747 --> 29:10.625
I LIKED IT BETTER
THE WAY IT WAS, MA--

29:10.792 --> 29:14.546
WHEN WE WERE
ALL HERE, TOGETHER.

29:14.712 --> 29:17.799
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,
MARY, SO DID I.

30:14.606 --> 30:16.316
LAURA, WE'RE
GOING TO BE LATE
FOR SCHOOL!

30:16.483 --> 30:18.651
YOU GO ON, CARRIE.
WE'LL CATCH UP.

30:18.818 --> 30:20.236
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU?

30:20.403 --> 30:22.113
JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING.

30:22.280 --> 30:23.490
WELL, LIKE WHAT?

30:23.656 --> 30:25.867
LIKE WHEN AM I GOING
TO GET SOME BUMPS?

30:27.410 --> 30:28.495
BUMPS?

30:28.661 --> 30:29.954
YOU KNOW.

30:30.121 --> 30:31.164
OH.

30:32.624 --> 30:33.541
YOU'VE GOT THEM.

30:33.708 --> 30:35.460
EVEN NELLIE OLESON'S
GOT THEM.

30:35.627 --> 30:39.047
AND THAT SAM,
SHE'S REALLY GOT THEM.

30:39.214 --> 30:40.965
WELL, LOOK,
LAURA, UH...

30:41.132 --> 30:43.134
EVERYBODY'S
NOT THE SAME.

30:43.301 --> 30:45.303
BESIDES, IT'S REALLY
NOT IMPORTANT.

30:45.470 --> 30:46.721
WELL, MAYBE NOT TO YOU,

30:46.888 --> 30:49.140
BUT I THINK IT IS
TO JIMMY HILL.

30:49.307 --> 30:51.643
THERE'S REALLY
NOTHING YOU CAN
DO ABOUT IT.

30:51.809 --> 30:52.852
YEAH.

31:51.703 --> 31:54.038
ALL RIGHT, CLASS,
SETTLE DOWN.

31:54.205 --> 31:55.748
NOW, WE'RE GOING TO START
WITH ARITHMETIC THIS MORNING,

31:55.915 --> 32:01.379
AND THE FIRST PROBLEM IS
23 INTO 4,675.

32:01.546 --> 32:04.382
LAURA INGALLS, WOULD YOU COME
WORK THE FIRST PROBLEM, PLEASE?

32:10.555 --> 32:11.306
LAURA.

32:27.196 --> 32:30.700
23 GOES INTO 46...

32:30.867 --> 32:31.659
2 TIMES.

32:34.912 --> 32:37.373
2 x 3 IS 6,

32:37.540 --> 32:39.626
AND 2 x 4 IS 4.

32:42.086 --> 32:44.839
6 TAKE AWAY 6 IS 0.

32:50.928 --> 32:54.265
LAURA, DON'T
YOU HAVE TO GO
TO THE OUTHOUSE?

32:54.432 --> 32:55.725
YES, MA'AM.
I SURE DO.

32:55.892 --> 32:57.185
MM-HMM.

33:01.856 --> 33:03.816
ALL RIGHT, CLASS,
SETTLE DOWN.

33:26.005 --> 33:27.215
WHOA, DAVID.

33:27.382 --> 33:29.509
WELL, I HAVEN'T SEEN
YOU TWO FOR
QUITE A SPELL.

33:29.676 --> 33:30.968
YEAH.
ABOUT 3 WEEKS.

33:31.135 --> 33:33.930
3 WEEKS
AND 2 DAYS.

33:34.097 --> 33:34.972
WE'VE
BEEN SHUTTLING

33:35.139 --> 33:37.475
BETWEEN NEW ULM
AND MANKATO.

33:37.642 --> 33:39.644
ALL RIGHT, BOYS.
UNLOAD THIS ONE NEXT.

33:39.811 --> 33:40.812
HOP TO IT.

33:40.978 --> 33:42.105
THIS IS THE CLOSEST
WE'VE BEEN TO HOME

33:42.271 --> 33:45.149
SINCE WE'VE BEEN
FREIGHTING REGULAR.

33:45.316 --> 33:46.484
YOU'RE 4 HOURS
AHEAD OF SCHEDULE.

33:46.651 --> 33:47.694
YEAH. WE GOT
SOME TIME COMING.

33:47.860 --> 33:49.278
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE
A COUPLE OF DAYS

33:49.445 --> 33:51.489
AND VISIT WITH OUR FAMILIES
WHILE THEY STILL REMEMBER US.

33:51.656 --> 33:53.574
SORRY. NOT THIS TRIP.

33:53.741 --> 33:55.159
OH, NOW, COME ON,
MR. PERKINS.

33:55.326 --> 33:57.328
HOLD ON. BEFORE
YOU START YELLING,

33:57.495 --> 33:59.789
I'VE GOT SOME GOOD NEWS
FOR YOU, BIG NEWS.

33:59.956 --> 34:01.124
LIKE WHAT?

34:01.290 --> 34:03.960
WELL, LIKE THE BOSS
IS VERY PLEASED
WITH YOU TWO.

34:04.127 --> 34:06.504
YOU'RE BOTH HARD-WORKING
AND DEPENDABLE.

34:06.671 --> 34:08.339
YOU'VE DONE A REAL GOOD JOB,

34:08.506 --> 34:11.134
AND HE WANTS TO SEE TO IT
THAT YOU DO A WHOLE LOT BETTER.

34:11.300 --> 34:14.220
HE SAYS HE'LL ADVANCE YOU
SOME MONEY SO YOU CAN GET
ANOTHER WAGON AND TEAM

34:14.387 --> 34:16.347
AND HIRE 2 MORE MEN.

34:16.514 --> 34:17.849
ANOTHER WAGON?

34:18.015 --> 34:20.977
HEY, WE'RE GOING
TO HAVE 2 WAGONS
ON THE ROAD, HUH?!

34:21.144 --> 34:22.395
WELL, HOW
DOES THAT SOUND?

34:22.562 --> 34:23.688
IT SOUNDS GREAT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK
WE'VE BEEN

34:23.855 --> 34:25.481
BUSTING OUR BUNS FOR
ALL THIS TIME?

34:25.648 --> 34:27.191
GOOD. I'LL SEE YOU
IN THE MORNING.

34:27.358 --> 34:30.027
I'LL HAVE YOU
ALL LOADED UP
AND READY TO ROLL.

34:30.194 --> 34:31.446
WE'LL BE READY!

34:31.612 --> 34:32.864
ALL RIGHT,

THEN WE'RE GOING

34:35.116 --> 34:36.951
AND WE'LL HAVE
OUR OWN FREIGHT TERMINAL!

34:37.118 --> 34:38.119
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE
GOING TO CELEBRATE.

34:38.286 --> 34:39.704
NO SLEEPING IN
A WAGON BED TONIGHT.

34:39.871 --> 34:41.456
NO EATING
OUT OF CANS.

34:41.622 --> 34:42.915
WE'RE GOING
TO GO TO THE FINEST
RESTAURANT THERE IS

34:43.082 --> 34:45.084
AND ORDER THE MOST
EXPENSIVE FOOD
ON THE MENU.

34:45.251 --> 34:47.920
OH, NO. NOT UNTIL
YOU HAVE A BATH.

34:48.087 --> 34:49.672
ALL RIGHT!
WHAT ARE WE
WAITING FOR?!

34:49.839 --> 34:53.468
REST YOUR FOOT, PARTNER!
WE'RE GOING TO THE HOTEL!

34:53.634 --> 34:54.552
WHOO-HOO!

35:01.142 --> 35:03.269
OH. BONSOIR,
MESSIEURS.

35:03.436 --> 35:04.270
FRANCOIS IS
AT YOUR SERVICE.

35:04.437 --> 35:05.271
HOW ARE YOU?

35:05.438 --> 35:06.773
TABLE FOR 2?

35:06.939 --> 35:08.983

35:09.150 --> 35:11.152
PLEASE FOLLOW ME.
PLEASE FOLLOW ME.

35:11.319 --> 35:13.029
THIS IS THE BEST TABLE
IN THE WHOLE HOUSE.

35:13.196 --> 35:15.406
YES. PLEASE, PLEASE.

35:15.573 --> 35:16.824
OH, THANK YOU.

35:20.077 --> 35:22.038
VOILA. AH. YES.

35:22.205 --> 35:23.498
FOR YOU.

35:24.832 --> 35:25.958
HOWDY, MA'AM.

35:28.503 --> 35:31.422
WHEW. THERE'S A LOT
OF STUFF ON THIS MENU,
ISN'T THERE?

35:31.589 --> 35:33.257
YEAH.
EXPENSIVE, TOO.

35:33.424 --> 35:36.594
THERE'S SO MUCH STUFF,
I CAN'T MAKE UP MY MIND.

35:36.761 --> 35:38.930
CHARLES, I CAN'T READ
NONE OF THESE WORDS.

35:39.096 --> 35:40.640
IT MUST BE
IN THAT I-TALIAN.

35:40.807 --> 35:42.141
NO, NO.
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S ITALIAN.

35:42.308 --> 35:44.018
I THINK IT'S--
WHATCHAMACALLIT--
FRENCH.

35:44.185 --> 35:45.353
THERE'S A LOT OF
FRENCH RESTAURANTS.

35:45.520 --> 35:48.022
I THINK
THAT'S WHAT THIS IS.

35:48.189 --> 35:48.940
WHAT IS THIS--

35:49.106 --> 35:50.274
ESCARGOTS?

35:50.441 --> 35:52.026
WHAT IS THAT?

35:52.193 --> 35:54.487
- ESCARGOTS? BEATS ME.
- I NEVER HEARD OF IT.

35:54.654 --> 35:56.531
MUST BE GOOD.
IT'S A DOLLAR.

35:56.697 --> 35:58.157
WHY DON'T WE
ASK HIM?

35:58.324 --> 36:00.159
UH, MR. FRANCOIS.

36:01.035 --> 36:02.245
OH. YES?

36:04.497 --> 36:06.582
LOOK, THERE'S JUST
SO MANY GOOD THINGS
TO EAT ON THE MENU,

36:06.749 --> 36:07.959
WE JUST CAN'T
MAKE A CHOICE,

36:08.125 --> 36:09.585
SO WE THOUGHT
MAYBE YOU COULD
JUST PICK OUT

36:09.752 --> 36:11.629
WHATEVER IS
THE BEST STUFF TO
EAT IN THIS PLACE.

36:11.796 --> 36:12.588
WHY, OF COURSE!

36:12.755 --> 36:13.840
AND HANG EXPENSE.

36:14.006 --> 36:15.633
- WE'RE CELEBRATING.

36:15.800 --> 36:16.759
THAT'S WONDERFUL.

36:16.926 --> 36:18.177

36:18.344 --> 36:22.849

SOME COFFEE.

36:41.784 --> 36:43.369
WELL, THAT SOUNDS GOOD.

36:43.536 --> 36:46.497
WHY DON'T YOU BRING US
2 OF ALL OF THEM THINGS
YOU TALKED ABOUT?

36:46.664 --> 36:48.416
FINE. AND, OF COURSE,
GENTLEMEN,

36:48.583 --> 36:52.837
YOU WILL WANT A BOTTLE

37:03.180 --> 37:05.099
BOY, THIS
IS SOME PLACE.
THIS IS LIVING.

37:05.266 --> 37:06.434
THIS IS HIGH
OFF THE HOG, CHARLES.

37:06.601 --> 37:07.685
THANK YOU.
AND I'LL TELL
YOU SOMETHING,

37:07.852 --> 37:09.228
WE DO WELL IN THAT
FREIGHTING BUSINESS,

37:09.395 --> 37:11.314
WE'LL BE EATING LIKE
THIS MAYBE ONCE,
TWICE A MONTH.

37:11.480 --> 37:14.108
YEAH. PRETTY QUICK,
WE'LL BE BUYING
ONE OF THEM BIG HOUSES

37:14.275 --> 37:16.694
AND MAYBE EVEN
LIVING IN THE CITY.

37:16.861 --> 37:19.447
SLEEPY EYE,
RED, '78.

37:19.614 --> 37:22.533
AN UNPRETENTIOUS
LITTLE WINE, BUT, OH HO HO!

37:22.700 --> 37:24.368
PLAYFUL, YES.

37:30.958 --> 37:32.043
WOULD YOU CARE
TO TASTE IT?

37:32.209 --> 37:33.920
WELL, THAT'S WHAT
I'VE ORDERED IT FOR.

37:36.881 --> 37:39.383
FILL IT UP. I DON'T
WANT TO PLAY WITH IT.
I WANT TO DRINK IT.

37:54.023 --> 37:54.941
THAT'S GOOD.

37:55.107 --> 37:56.734
THAT'S FINE.
THANKS VERY MUCH.

37:56.901 --> 37:57.944
THANK YOU.

37:59.654 --> 38:01.030
LOOK AT
THOSE YOUNG'UNS
OVER THERE.

38:06.077 --> 38:08.621
HMM.

38:08.788 --> 38:09.914
CUTE, AIN'T THEY?

38:11.582 --> 38:14.251
I CAN HARDLY BELIEVE
I HAVEN'T SEEN MY GIRLS
IN ALMOST A MONTH.

38:20.800 --> 38:22.677
THAT BOY OF MINE
IS GROWING SO FAST,

38:22.843 --> 38:25.137
IN A MONTH, I MIGHT NOT
EVEN BE ABLE TO RECOGNIZE HIM.

38:31.102 --> 38:32.728
YEAH.

38:32.895 --> 38:34.814
BUT IT'S ALL
WORTH IT, THOUGH.

38:34.981 --> 38:37.566
GOING TO MAKE OURSELVES
A PILE OF MONEY.
YOU WAIT AND SEE.

38:37.733 --> 38:40.486
GOT TO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY
IF WE'LL BE EATING
IN A PLACE LIKE THIS.

39:11.642 --> 39:12.893
VOILA, MESSIEURS!

39:13.060 --> 39:15.604
ESCARGOTS
A LA FRANCOIS.

39:15.771 --> 39:18.983
IT'S THE MOST TERRIFIC DISH
IN THE ENTIRE HOUSE.

39:19.150 --> 39:20.234
YOURS, SIR.

39:33.289 --> 39:34.915
THEM'S SNAILS!

39:35.082 --> 39:36.917
YES. OF COURSE.

39:37.084 --> 39:38.169
ESCARGOTS.

39:43.215 --> 39:45.342
CHARLES, IF THIS IS
THE WAY THE RICH EAT,

39:45.509 --> 39:46.886
I'D RATHER BE POOR.

39:50.890 --> 39:52.016
ME, TOO.

39:53.517 --> 39:54.894
CANCEL THEM DINNERS.

39:55.061 --> 39:55.895
BUT, MESSIEURS--

39:56.062 --> 39:57.396
HEY, CANCEL 'EM!

39:59.398 --> 40:00.941
NOW, YOU LISTEN TO ME.

40:01.108 --> 40:05.488
YOU KNOW, IF WE LEAVE
RIGHT NOW, WE CAN BE HOME
BEFORE FIRST LIGHT.

40:05.654 --> 40:06.697
WHAT ARE WE
WAITING FOR?

40:06.864 --> 40:08.616
NOT THESE SNAILS,
THAT'S FOR SURE.

40:11.702 --> 40:12.745
SNAILS.

40:38.062 --> 40:39.146
WHOA.

40:52.201 --> 40:53.786
THIS IS A SURPRISE.

40:57.748 --> 41:00.042
YEAH, WELL, IT'S...
KIND OF A SURPRISE
TO ME, TOO.

41:02.920 --> 41:04.463
IT'S JUST
AN OVERNIGHT STAY?

41:08.050 --> 41:09.135
THAT'S, UH...

41:11.178 --> 41:13.180
THAT'S WHAT I WANT
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

41:16.851 --> 41:17.977
I'M LISTENING.

41:22.565 --> 41:25.276
WE, UH...

41:25.442 --> 41:26.986
THAT IS,
ME AND JONATHAN, WE...

41:29.029 --> 41:30.447
WE GAVE THEM BACK
THE FREIGHTING CONTRACT,

41:30.614 --> 41:32.908
AND WE DECIDED WE
DIDN'T WANT TO TAKE
ANY MORE.

41:37.955 --> 41:39.790
I KNOW IT'S GIVING UP
A LOT OF MONEY.

41:39.957 --> 41:41.333
I HOPE YOU'RE NOT
TOO UPSET ABOUT IT.

41:43.419 --> 41:44.795
I'D LIKE TO HEAR WHY.

41:47.840 --> 41:49.425
WE JUST TALKED IT OVER,

41:49.592 --> 41:52.469
AND WE DECIDED WE
DIDN'T WANT TO RUN A BIG
FREIGHTING COMPANY...

41:54.346 --> 41:56.807
OR LIVE IN A...BIG HOUSE

41:56.974 --> 41:58.726
AND GO TO A BUNCH
OF FANCY RESTAURANTS.

42:02.646 --> 42:04.857
WE JUST WANTED TO BE
WHAT WE ARE, THAT'S ALL.

42:07.693 --> 42:08.944
WHAT'S THAT, CHARLES?

42:11.530 --> 42:15.201
WELL, YOUR HUSBAND,
FOR ONE THING, AND...

42:15.367 --> 42:17.620
A FATHER
TO MY CHILDREN. I'M--

42:17.786 --> 42:20.247
I MEAN, I MISS YOU.
I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU
ONCE IN A WHILE.

42:24.335 --> 42:26.921
I'M JUST NOT CUT OUT
FOR IT. I'M SORRY.

42:27.087 --> 42:28.005
OH!

42:28.172 --> 42:30.674
YOU GREAT BIG GALOOT!

42:30.841 --> 42:34.678
THAT IS THE GRANDEST THING
YOU EVER SAID TO ME.

42:34.845 --> 42:35.596
OH.

42:35.763 --> 42:37.306
OH.

42:37.473 --> 42:39.683
I JUST
COULDN'T DO IT.

42:39.850 --> 42:41.685
OH, I MISSED YOU.

42:41.852 --> 42:42.728
OH.

42:42.895 --> 42:45.272
I'M SO GLAD.

42:45.439 --> 42:47.483
YOU KNOW, I WAS
STARTING TO THINK OF
THAT FREIGHTING COMPANY

42:47.650 --> 42:49.693
AS SOME KIND
OF A RIVAL.

42:49.860 --> 42:51.487
MMM.

42:51.654 --> 42:53.072
OH, NO.
NO COMPETITION.

42:53.239 --> 42:54.365
HA HA!

42:54.531 --> 42:55.366
NO COMPETITION.

42:55.532 --> 42:57.368
NONE AT ALL.

42:57.534 --> 42:59.203
OH!

42:59.370 --> 43:01.080
OH.

43:01.247 --> 43:03.540
WELCOME HOME, CHARLES.

43:03.707 --> 43:05.668
WELCOME HOME.

43:05.834 --> 43:07.962
LAURA, PLEASE
DON'T CRY ANYMORE.

43:08.128 --> 43:10.881
PA IS BACK.
COME ON. GET UP.

43:11.048 --> 43:13.467
I'LL
NEVER GET UP.
NEVER!

43:13.634 --> 43:16.428
AND I'LL NEVER
GO TO SCHOOL
AGAIN.

43:23.769 --> 43:24.645
HEY, MARY!

43:24.812 --> 43:25.813
PA! I'M SO GLAD
YOU'RE HOME.

43:25.980 --> 43:26.939
ME, TOO!

43:27.106 --> 43:28.649
WELL, THEN THAT MAKES IT
UNANIMOUS, HUH?

43:28.816 --> 43:29.900
I'LL TELL YOU
SOMETHING ELSE.

43:30.067 --> 43:31.318
I'M HOME FOR GOOD.
NO MORE FREIGHTING.

43:31.485 --> 43:32.236
OH, PA!

43:32.403 --> 43:33.737
WHERE'S YOUR SISTER?

43:33.904 --> 43:37.241
UH, SHE SAYS SHE'S
NEVER GOING TO GO
TO SCHOOL AGAIN.

43:37.408 --> 43:38.993
WHAT'S THIS
ALL ABOUT?

43:39.159 --> 43:42.413
WELL, THAT'S SOMETHING
YOU MISSED WHILE YOU
WERE AWAY, CHARLES.

43:42.579 --> 43:44.373
NOW THAT I'M BACK,
I'LL GO UP
AND TALK TO HER.

43:44.540 --> 43:48.294
UH, CHARLES, LET ME TAKE
CARE OF IT. PLEASE?

43:48.460 --> 43:49.503
SURE.

43:58.220 --> 44:00.014
NOW, YOUNG LADY,

44:00.180 --> 44:03.475
WHAT'S THIS I HEAR
ABOUT NEVER GOING
TO SCHOOL AGAIN?

44:03.642 --> 44:05.269
I CAN'T, MA.

44:05.436 --> 44:08.522
I MADE A FOOL
OUT OF MYSELF YESTERDAY.

44:08.689 --> 44:09.815
I QUITE AGREE.

44:15.070 --> 44:16.447
YOU DO?

44:16.613 --> 44:18.115
YES.

44:18.282 --> 44:21.327
ANYBODY WHO PRETENDS
TO BE ANYBODY ELSE

44:21.493 --> 44:23.370
IS JUST PLAIN
DOWNRIGHT SILLY.

44:25.456 --> 44:27.291
WELL, I JUST WANT
OTHER PEOPLE--

44:29.293 --> 44:31.128
JIMMY HILL--

44:31.295 --> 44:32.421
TO LIKE ME.

44:35.049 --> 44:38.969
BEFORE THEY CAN,
YOU HAVE TO LIKE
YOURSELF.

44:39.136 --> 44:43.223
THAT'S THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING
OF ALL.

44:43.390 --> 44:45.434
WE HAVE TO BE...

44:45.601 --> 44:48.604
TO BECOME
WHAT GOD INTENDED.

44:50.147 --> 44:53.150
IF HE WENT TO ALL
THE TROUBLE TO MAKE
A LAURA INGALLS,

44:53.317 --> 44:54.568
HE CERTAINLY
WOULDN'T WANT HER

44:54.735 --> 44:56.528
TO ACT
LIKE ANYBODY ELSE.

44:59.823 --> 45:00.991
GOD MUST LIKE
LAURA INGALLS

45:01.158 --> 45:03.869
AN AWFUL LOT.

45:04.036 --> 45:05.329
SO WHY
SHOULDN'T YOU?

45:10.751 --> 45:12.294
I NEVER THOUGHT
ABOUT IT THAT WAY.

45:13.796 --> 45:15.839
WELL,
NOW THAT YOU HAVE,

45:16.006 --> 45:19.343
I WANT YOU
TO GET UP AND GET
DRESSED FOR SCHOOL,

45:19.510 --> 45:22.471
AND I EXPECT YOU
TO CONDUCT YOURSELF

45:22.638 --> 45:24.765
LIKE LAURA INGALLS...

45:24.932 --> 45:27.726
NOT SOME POOR IMITATION
OF SOMEBODY ELSE.

45:36.026 --> 45:37.111
THANK YOU, MA.

45:52.543 --> 45:54.711
HI, MARY!
HI, JIMMY!

45:54.878 --> 45:56.046
OH, HI, LAURA.
WANT TO PLAY?

45:56.213 --> 45:57.047
SURE!

45:57.214 --> 45:58.215
COME ON!
LET'S PLAY BALL!

45:58.382 --> 45:59.299
DO YOU WANT
TO BE UP FIRST?

45:59.466 --> 46:01.343
YEAH.

46:01.510 --> 46:03.512
I'M GOING TO KNOCK YOU
ON YOUR TAIL, INGALLS,

46:03.679 --> 46:05.389
WITH MY FLYING FASTBALL.

46:05.556 --> 46:07.933
PUT THE BALL WHERE
YOUR MOUTH IS, SAM.

46:08.100 --> 46:09.768
COME ON, LAURA!
HIT A HOME RUN!

46:20.904 --> 46:21.989
YAY!

46:22.156 --> 46:24.241
WHOO!

46:33.417 --> 46:35.169
DID YOU EVER CARRY
SAMANTHA'S BOOKS HOME?

46:35.335 --> 46:38.088
NAH.
SHE CARRIED MINE.

46:38.255 --> 46:39.590
I DIDN'T WANT
HER TO, MIND YOU,

46:39.756 --> 46:41.633
BUT SHE'S
KIND OF A BULLY.

46:41.800 --> 46:42.759
WELL,
I'LL BE SEEING YOU.

46:42.926 --> 46:44.303
WAIT.
YOU'VE GOT MY BOOKS.

47:11.788 --> 47:13.499
CHAMP.

47:13.665 --> 47:15.876
WANT TO GO
FISHING SATURDAY?

47:16.043 --> 47:18.003
SURE.
I'LL BRING THE WORMS.

47:18.170 --> 47:19.254
IT'S A DEAL.

47:21.798 --> 47:22.883
LAURA!

47:25.385 --> 47:26.803
I DIDN'T THINK
IT WAS YUCKY.

47:27.930 --> 47:29.264
ME, NEITHER.
